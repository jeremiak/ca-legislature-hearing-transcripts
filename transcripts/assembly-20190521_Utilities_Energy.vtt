A LITTLE CLOSER THERE WE GO TIME

00:33:04.482 --> 00:33:05.750
TO TALK ABOUT OUR WHILE FIRE

00:33:05.817 --> 00:33:07.952
MITIGATION PLAN -- IT'S NOT A

00:33:08.019 --> 00:33:10.922
NEW THING AS THE CHAIR MENTIONED --

00:33:10.988 --> 00:33:12.557
SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC --

00:33:12.623 --> 00:33:15.193
HAS BEEN ACTIVELY -- PURSUING --

00:33:15.259 --> 00:33:17.195
MITIGATION PLANS NOW FOR OVER A

00:33:17.261 --> 00:33:18.930
DECADE AND IS ALREADY INVESTED

00:33:18.996 --> 00:33:20.932
OVER ONE POINT FOUR BILLION

00:33:20.998 --> 00:33:23.134
DOLLARS -- IN HARDENING THE

00:33:23.201 --> 00:33:24.969
SYSTEM AND A LOT OF WHAT I'M

00:33:25.036 --> 00:33:27.305
GOING -- TO SHARE WITH YOU IS

00:33:27.372 --> 00:33:28.573
ONE THAT THE QUESTION AT THE TOP

00:33:28.639 --> 00:33:30.375
OF THE AGENDA ARE THESE PLANS

00:33:30.441 --> 00:33:33.745
REALLY MITIGATING THAT POTENTIAL.

00:33:33.811 --> 00:33:35.613
FOR CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE ON THE

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.082
ANSWER FROM SAN DIEGO IS YES --

00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:39.851
THEY ARE SINCE WE'VE IMPLEMENTED

00:33:39.917 --> 00:33:41.886
THIS PLAN OVER A DECADE AGO WE

00:33:41.953 --> 00:33:44.055
HAVE NOT SEEN -- IN A

00:33:44.122 --> 00:33:45.957
CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRESCOMIC

00:33:46.023 --> 00:33:47.592
KNIGHTED BY ELECTRICAL.

00:33:47.658 --> 00:33:50.194
EQUIPMENT ACROSS OUR REGION --

00:33:50.261 --> 00:33:51.829
BUT WHAT THAT HASN'T STOPPED IS

00:33:51.896 --> 00:33:53.765
CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT ND WE

00:33:53.831 --> 00:33:55.767
REALLY FOCUS IN THREE AREAS ONE

00:33:55.833 --> 00:33:57.268
IS THE OPERATIONS IN THE

00:33:57.335 --> 00:33:58.569
ENGINEERING OF THE SYSTEM.

00:33:58.636 --> 00:33:59.904
ANOTHER GETS INTO OUR

00:33:59.971 --> 00:34:01.305
SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND

00:34:01.372 --> 00:34:03.207
WHETHER TECHNOLOGY AND THEN WE

00:34:03.274 --> 00:34:07.512
FOCUS VERY CLOSELY ON CUSTOMER

00:34:07.578 --> 00:34:08.813
OUTREACH.

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:09.847
ON AN EDUCATION AND PART OF WHAT

00:34:09.914 --> 00:34:10.415
I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU

00:34:10.481 --> 00:34:11.315
TODAY IS SOME OF THE NEWER

00:34:11.382 --> 00:34:12.917
COMPONENTS IN THE EVOLUTION OF

00:34:12.984 --> 00:34:15.319
OUR WHILE FIRE MITIGATION PLAN --

00:34:15.386 --> 00:34:17.455
AND WHERE IT IS TODAY AND PART

00:34:17.522 --> 00:34:19.924
OF THE FOCUS ON THE TWO THOUSAND

00:34:19.991 --> 00:34:21.592
NINETEEN PLAN IS REALLY GETTING

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:23.394
INTO FUEL MANAGEMENT -- I WILL

00:34:23.461 --> 00:34:26.264
TOUCH ON VEGETATION MANAGEMENT

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:28.032
BUT THERE'S A REAL OPPORTUNITY.

00:34:28.099 --> 00:34:29.801
FOR THE UTILITIES TO WORK WITH

00:34:29.867 --> 00:34:32.170
THE FIRE AGENCIES WITH THE

00:34:32.236 --> 00:34:33.771
FEDERAL AGENCIES LIKE BUREAU OF

00:34:33.838 --> 00:34:36.374
LAND MANAGEMENT AND START USING

00:34:36.441 --> 00:34:37.275
EASEMENTS.

00:34:37.341 --> 00:34:39.577
AS FIRE BREAKS THIS IS SOMETHING

00:34:39.644 --> 00:34:40.678
WE HAVEN'T.

00:34:40.745 --> 00:34:42.380
DONE EXTENSIVELY IN THE PAST AND

00:34:42.447 --> 00:34:45.049
WE'RE REALLY EXPANDING IT AS

00:34:45.116 --> 00:34:47.218
PART OF THIS YEAR'S PLAN --

00:34:47.285 --> 00:34:48.319
ANOTHER AREA THAT WE'RE LOOKING

00:34:48.386 --> 00:34:50.955
AT IS ENHANCING OUR IGNITION

00:34:51.022 --> 00:34:54.759
MANAGEMENT PROGRAM WE'VE TRACKED --

00:34:54.826 --> 00:34:57.094
IGNITIONS COMING FROM.

00:34:57.161 --> 00:34:58.496
THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM BUT NOW

00:34:58.563 --> 00:35:00.631
WE'RE TRACKING EVERY SPARK IF WE

00:35:00.698 --> 00:35:02.767
CAN AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND AND

00:35:02.834 --> 00:35:05.403
STUDY THIS AND REALLY START --

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:07.972
TO APPLY SCIENTIFIC METHODS TO

00:35:08.039 --> 00:35:09.607
IGNITIONS COMING FROM THE SYSTEM

00:35:09.674 --> 00:35:12.376
AND START TO IDENTIFY TRENDS --

00:35:12.443 --> 00:35:13.778
TO FURTHER MITIGATE THOSE IN

00:35:13.845 --> 00:35:16.314
THAT TO A KEY COMPONENT OF OUR

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:18.015
PLAN.

00:35:18.082 --> 00:35:20.017
IN.

00:35:20.084 --> 00:35:20.718
TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN PUBLIC

00:35:20.785 --> 00:35:22.620
SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF HAS BEEN

00:35:22.687 --> 00:35:23.855
SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN USING

00:35:23.921 --> 00:35:26.991
AS A TOOL IN SAN DIEGO NOW. FOR

00:35:27.058 --> 00:35:29.560
ALMOST A DECADE -- AND IT

00:35:29.627 --> 00:35:31.395
CONTINUES TO EVOLVE AND OF

00:35:31.462 --> 00:35:32.997
COURSE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS

00:35:33.064 --> 00:35:35.099
WE'VE LEARNED A LOT OF LESSONS

00:35:35.166 --> 00:35:36.667
AS WE'VE HAD TO IMPLEMENT IT --

00:35:36.734 --> 00:35:38.169
ON A BROADER SCALE THAN WE'VE

00:35:38.236 --> 00:35:40.771
EVER HAD TO PREVIOUSLY -- BUT

00:35:40.838 --> 00:35:42.273
WHAT WE'RE DOING THIS YEAR IS

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:44.442
WERE GOING IN AND TRYING TO ADD

00:35:44.509 --> 00:35:46.110
ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT.

00:35:46.177 --> 00:35:47.812
IN PLACES WHERE IT MAKES SENSE

00:35:47.879 --> 00:35:49.647
BASED OFF ALL OF OUR WEATHER

00:35:49.714 --> 00:35:51.516
INFORMATION AND START TO

00:35:51.582 --> 00:35:53.017
MINIMIZE THE IMPACT.

00:35:53.084 --> 00:35:54.552
THAT IT HAS ON OUR COMMUNITIES

00:35:54.619 --> 00:35:56.921
IF IT MAKES SENSE IN SOME CASES

00:35:56.988 --> 00:35:59.423
IF WE PUT EQUIPMENT -- JUST TO

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:00.791
ISOLATE SMALLER AMOUNTS OF

00:36:00.858 --> 00:36:02.894
CUSTOMERS THAT'S A MOVE THAT

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:04.795
WE'RE DOING AND IN ADDITION TO

00:36:04.862 --> 00:36:06.330
MINIMIZING THE IMPACT IT ALSO

00:36:06.397 --> 00:36:08.866
ENABLES US -- IN SOME CASES TO

00:36:08.933 --> 00:36:12.203
REENERGIZE MORE QUICKLY -- AFTER

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:15.006
AN EVENT HAS PASSED -- SO THAT'S

00:36:15.072 --> 00:36:18.009
A LARGE FOCUS OF OUR PLANNED

00:36:18.075 --> 00:36:19.277
COMING INTO THIS YEAR.

00:36:19.343 --> 00:36:21.646
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT HAS ALWAYS

00:36:21.712 --> 00:36:23.714
BEEN -- SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN

00:36:23.781 --> 00:36:25.182
EXTREMELY AGGRESSIVE ACT IN SAN

00:36:25.249 --> 00:36:29.020
DIEGO. FOR OVER THE LAST DECADE

00:36:29.086 --> 00:36:30.755
BUT WE'RE REALLY EXPANDING THAT

00:36:30.821 --> 00:36:32.657
PROGRAM AGAIN THIS YEAR AS PART

00:36:32.723 --> 00:36:35.226
OF OUR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN

00:36:35.293 --> 00:36:36.661
WHILE FIRE MITIGATION PLAN.

00:36:36.727 --> 00:36:38.696
OUR INSPECTION RATE.

00:36:38.763 --> 00:36:40.998
IS BEING DOUBLE -- SO WE WILL

00:36:41.065 --> 00:36:42.567
GET HIGHS THROUGH OUR ENTIRE

00:36:42.633 --> 00:36:45.069
HIGH FIRE THREAT AREAS TWICE AND

00:36:45.136 --> 00:36:48.005
THAT WILL ALL BE -- INSPECTED.

00:36:48.072 --> 00:36:49.774
IN ADDITION WHEN WE SEE A MAJOR

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:50.975
EVENT COMING.

00:36:51.042 --> 00:36:53.277
WILL BE TARGETING THOSE WINDIEST

00:36:53.344 --> 00:36:55.413
AREAS -- AND GOING IN AND DOING

00:36:55.479 --> 00:36:57.415
PRE INSPECTIONS CHEST BEFORE AN

00:36:57.481 --> 00:37:00.585
EVENT -- TRYING TO MAKE SURE

00:37:00.651 --> 00:37:02.486
THAT WE DON'T FIND ANY -- ANY

00:37:02.553 --> 00:37:03.955
ISSUES WITH THE VEGETATION IN

00:37:04.021 --> 00:37:04.956
THAT AREA.

00:37:05.022 --> 00:37:06.757
WE'RE ALSO INCREASING OUR POSTS

00:37:06.824 --> 00:37:07.992
TRAM.

00:37:08.059 --> 00:37:09.560
IN SOME CASES WHERE IT MAKES

00:37:09.627 --> 00:37:11.629
SENSE UP TO EVEN TWENTY FIVE

00:37:11.696 --> 00:37:14.265
FEET -- BUT WE'RE VERY

00:37:14.332 --> 00:37:15.900
AGGRESSIVE WITH OUR PUBLIC POST

00:37:15.967 --> 00:37:18.769
TRAM CLEARANCES RIGHT NOW AND

00:37:18.836 --> 00:37:20.304
THEN THE OTHER MAJOR COMPONENT

00:37:20.371 --> 00:37:22.273
THIS YEAR IS WERE REALLY TAKING

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:24.875
ALL OF THE TREES THAT WE TRACK

00:37:24.942 --> 00:37:25.843
ALMOST HALF A MILLION.

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:27.812
AND CORRELATING IT TO ALL OF OUR

00:37:27.878 --> 00:37:29.113
WEATHER INFORMATION.

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:30.848
BECAUSE WE KNOW NOW SOME TREES

00:37:30.915 --> 00:37:32.617
ARE IN NGUYEN CORRIDORS AND WE

00:37:32.683 --> 00:37:34.518
HAVE ALL THE WEATHER INFORMATION

00:37:34.585 --> 00:37:35.219
WE HAVE ALL THIS TREE

00:37:35.286 --> 00:37:35.953
INFORMATION.

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:37.288
SO IT'S A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR

00:37:37.355 --> 00:37:38.856
US TO START TYING THESE TWO

00:37:38.923 --> 00:37:40.291
TOGETHER AND MAKE SOME SMART

00:37:40.358 --> 00:37:41.859
DECISIONS AND START TO

00:37:41.926 --> 00:37:42.994
UNDERSTAND WHERE.

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:46.030
THOSE TREES WOULD BE MOST PRONE --

00:37:46.097 --> 00:37:47.999
TO IMPACTS SO THOSE ARE SOME OF

00:37:48.065 --> 00:37:50.201
OUR ENHANCEMENTS WITH BADGE

00:37:50.267 --> 00:37:52.236
ANAGEMENT THIS YEAR -- ARE

00:37:52.303 --> 00:37:54.572
SITUATIONAL AWARENESS PROGRAM AT

00:37:54.639 --> 00:37:57.875
SDG ANY -- HAS BEEN RIGHT NOW --

00:37:57.942 --> 00:37:59.276
OF ALL BEING VERY QUICKLY FOR

00:37:59.343 --> 00:38:01.012
THE LAST TEN YEARS AND IT

00:38:01.078 --> 00:38:03.014
CONTINUES TO INVOLVE OUR WEATHER

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:05.149
NETWORK -- CURRENTLY IS AT A

00:38:05.216 --> 00:38:06.584
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN

00:38:06.651 --> 00:38:08.219
WEATHER STATIONS ON THAT NETWORK

00:38:08.285 --> 00:38:09.720
IS BEING REBUILT AND IT'S

00:38:09.787 --> 00:38:14.692
EXPANDING -- DOWN INTO COASTAL

00:38:14.759 --> 00:38:15.426
AREAS COASTAL CANYONS.

00:38:15.493 --> 00:38:16.927
THE CAMERA NETWORK WHICH

00:38:16.994 --> 00:38:18.262
CURRENTLY THERE'S OVER A HUNDRED

00:38:18.329 --> 00:38:19.764
CAMERAS BEING MONITORED FROM

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:22.166
MOUNTAIN TOPS ACROSS THE REGION --

00:38:22.233 --> 00:38:23.434
THAT'S BEING EXPANDED.

00:38:23.501 --> 00:38:25.169
STILL IN CLOSE COLLABORATION

00:38:25.236 --> 00:38:26.771
WITH CAL FIRE IN THE UNIVERSITY

00:38:26.837 --> 00:38:29.640
SYSTEM ALL OF OUR TOOLS -- LIKE

00:38:29.707 --> 00:38:31.275
THE FIRE POTENTIAL IMPACTS IN

00:38:31.342 --> 00:38:32.677
THE SAND AND A WILDFIRE THREAD

00:38:32.743 --> 00:38:33.978
INDEX WHICH IS BUILT WITH THE

00:38:34.045 --> 00:38:36.247
FOR SERVICE THOSE ARE ALL BEING

00:38:36.313 --> 00:38:37.748
AND WE'RE ADDING DATA

00:38:37.815 --> 00:38:39.250
APPLICATIONS TO IT ADDING

00:38:39.316 --> 00:38:40.818
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WHERE WE

00:38:40.885 --> 00:38:42.119
CAN WITH THIS FIRE POTENTIAL

00:38:42.186 --> 00:38:43.054
INDEX.

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:44.188
AND CONTINUING TO PUSH THE

00:38:44.255 --> 00:38:47.391
ENVELOPE ON THESE TOOLS --

00:38:47.458 --> 00:38:49.593
MOVING FORWARD AND THEN ALSO ARE

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:51.562
WILDFIRE RISK REDUCTION MODEL

00:38:51.629 --> 00:38:54.031
WHICH CAN SIMULATE FIRE BEHAVIOR

00:38:54.098 --> 00:38:55.433
WE'RE INCORPORATING OUR

00:38:55.499 --> 00:38:57.301
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT DATA INTO

00:38:57.368 --> 00:38:59.336
THAT SYSTEM SO WE CAN ACTUALLY

00:38:59.403 --> 00:39:02.506
DEVELOP RISK PROFILES FOR TREES.

00:39:02.573 --> 00:39:04.375
WITHIN THE SYSTEM SAYING IF IF A

00:39:04.442 --> 00:39:05.843
FIRE WOULD ORIGINATE FROM THIS

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:08.179
CLUSTER OF TREES IT WOULD END UP

00:39:08.245 --> 00:39:09.880
BEING VERY CATASTROPHIC FOR DOWN

00:39:09.947 --> 00:39:11.449
WIND COMMUNITY.

00:39:11.515 --> 00:39:12.917
AND WE'RE STARTING TO TIE ALL

00:39:12.983 --> 00:39:15.352
THESE SYSTEMS TOGETHER -- NOW

00:39:15.419 --> 00:39:16.687
MOVING FORWARD BUT THE

00:39:16.754 --> 00:39:18.989
INTELLIGENCE IS NOT JUST WITH

00:39:19.056 --> 00:39:19.957
ALL THE WEATHER INFORMATION

00:39:20.024 --> 00:39:21.425
THERE'S ALSO INTELLIGENCE ON THE

00:39:21.492 --> 00:39:24.128
SYSTEM WITH PROTECTIVE DEVICES.

00:39:24.195 --> 00:39:25.629
AND WE'RE INVESTING IN NOW

00:39:25.696 --> 00:39:28.065
FALLING CONDUCTOR PROTECTION

00:39:28.132 --> 00:39:30.468
WHERE WE HAVE SENSORS BUT IF THE

00:39:30.534 --> 00:39:31.569
LINE BREAKS.

00:39:31.635 --> 00:39:33.037
THE SENSORS WILL SENSE THAT

00:39:33.104 --> 00:39:36.073
BEFORE THE LINE HITS THE GROUND.

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:38.476
AND TURN IT OFF THAT REQUIRES

00:39:38.542 --> 00:39:40.377
UNINTERRUPTED VERY STABLE

00:39:40.444 --> 00:39:41.712
COMMUNICATION ON THE SYSTEM SO

00:39:41.779 --> 00:39:43.514
ES DE GENIE IS BUILDING A

00:39:43.581 --> 00:39:44.882
PRIVATE LTE.

00:39:44.949 --> 00:39:45.850
AS PART OF THE WILD FIRE

00:39:45.916 --> 00:39:47.485
MITIGATION PLAN WE THINK THAT'S

00:39:47.551 --> 00:39:49.120
GOING TO BE.

00:39:49.186 --> 00:39:51.655
A CRITICAL COMPONENT -- MOVING

00:39:51.722 --> 00:39:53.057
FORWARD TO HAVE THE TYPE OF

00:39:53.124 --> 00:39:55.192
COMMUNICATION THAT WE NEED FOR

00:39:55.259 --> 00:39:56.694
THE GREAT OF THE FUTURE CAN YOU

00:39:56.761 --> 00:39:59.630
JUSTIFY AN LTV IT'S A LONG TERM

00:39:59.697 --> 00:40:01.732
EVOLUTION IT'S ACTUALLY A CELL

00:40:01.799 --> 00:40:06.337
COMMUNICATION TERM -- WE'VE

00:40:06.403 --> 00:40:08.205
HEARD OF FIVE G..

00:40:08.272 --> 00:40:09.373
AS SAID TYPE OF LTE NETWORK BUT

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:10.174
IT'S A COMMUNICATION THAT WILL

00:40:10.241 --> 00:40:12.143
ENABLE PROTECTIVE DEVICES ON THE

00:40:12.209 --> 00:40:14.245
SYSTEM. TO COMMUNICATE IN REAL

00:40:14.311 --> 00:40:19.216
TIME.

00:40:19.283 --> 00:40:21.819
WE ONLY ASK BECAUSE OF THE TWO

00:40:21.886 --> 00:40:24.522
HUNDRED OR SO -- LIST OF

00:40:24.588 --> 00:40:26.757
ACRONYMS THAT ONE WEAPON OF WITH

00:40:26.824 --> 00:40:29.493
LOU ONE THAT'S NOT ON IT YEAH

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:32.363
THANK YOU -- THE CUSTOMER OUT

00:40:32.429 --> 00:40:33.430
REACH CONTINUES TO EXPAND AND

00:40:33.497 --> 00:40:34.799
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WERE --

00:40:34.865 --> 00:40:37.034
PUTTING A LOT OF EFFORT INTO --

00:40:37.101 --> 00:40:40.037
THIS YEAR BOTH ON STATEWIDE --

00:40:40.104 --> 00:40:41.672
CAMPAIGNS WORKING WITH

00:40:41.739 --> 00:40:43.340
COLLEAGUES IN CALLOW WE ASK BUT

00:40:43.407 --> 00:40:45.409
THEN LOCALLY IN SAN DIEGO DOING

00:40:45.476 --> 00:40:46.911
DOCUMENTARIES.

00:40:46.977 --> 00:40:48.045
THAT WILL BE AIRING ON LOCAL

00:40:48.112 --> 00:40:50.247

OUR ENTERPRISE NOTIFICATION

00:40:57.955 --> 00:40:59.523
SYSTEM IS BEING MODIFIED SO THAT

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:00.825
IT CAN HANDLE HIGHER CALL

00:41:00.891 --> 00:41:03.027
VOLUMES AND DUE TO A TEXTING.

00:41:03.093 --> 00:41:04.228
SO THAT WE CAN DO AUTOMATED

00:41:04.295 --> 00:41:05.763
TEXTING WITH CUSTOMERS SO THAT

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:07.765
WE'RE FINDING WAYS TO EASE THE

00:41:07.832 --> 00:41:09.233
COMMUNICATION -- WITH THOSE

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.869
CUSTOMERS WE'RE CONTINUING TO

00:41:11.936 --> 00:41:14.371
PARTNER WITH YOU SEE ES DE ON

00:41:14.438 --> 00:41:16.006
COMMUNICATIONS I'M NOT ONLY TO

00:41:16.073 --> 00:41:17.908
STABILIZE THE CAMERA NETWORKS

00:41:17.975 --> 00:41:19.243
AND THAT SITUATIONAL AWARENESS

00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:21.278
BUT THIS ALSO BRINGS INTERNET TO

00:41:21.345 --> 00:41:22.580
ALL OF THE BACK COUNTRY FIRE

00:41:22.646 --> 00:41:23.714
STATIONS.

00:41:23.781 --> 00:41:25.950
SO WE'RE STABILIZING THAT SO

00:41:26.016 --> 00:41:26.483
THAT IT COULD WITHSTAND A

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:29.954
PROLONGED PS PS EVENT -- WITHOUT --

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:31.422
PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF

00:41:31.488 --> 00:41:34.291
EVENT -- WITHOUT LOSING INTERNET

00:41:34.358 --> 00:41:38.896
CONNECTIVITY -- TO BACK COUNTRY

00:41:38.963 --> 00:41:39.763
FIRE STATIONS.

00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:41.232
AND THE MORE ALSO RIGHT NOW JUST

00:41:41.298 --> 00:41:42.833
IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:44.535
GENERATOR GRANT PROGRAM.

00:41:44.602 --> 00:41:46.036
AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE

00:41:46.103 --> 00:41:48.339
IS ACTUALLY PROVIDING HAD LIKE A

00:41:48.405 --> 00:41:50.207
BATTERY GENERATOR THAT SOLAR

00:41:50.274 --> 00:41:52.443
POWERED THAT SOMEBODY COULD USE

00:41:52.509 --> 00:41:54.111
TO POWER -- PIECE OF LIFE

00:41:54.178 --> 00:41:56.146
SUPPORT EQUIPMENT SO THE EXAMPLE

00:41:56.213 --> 00:41:57.381
I THINK IF SOMEBODY'S ON

00:41:57.448 --> 00:41:59.450
DIALYSIS -- WE'RE STARTING THIS

00:41:59.516 --> 00:42:01.252
GENERATOR GRANT PROGRAM THIS A

00:42:01.318 --> 00:42:03.187
THIRD PARTY INVOLVED -- BUT IT'S

00:42:03.254 --> 00:42:04.488
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE WE'RE JUST

00:42:04.555 --> 00:42:05.789
DEVELOPING THIS YEAR TAKING

00:42:05.856 --> 00:42:07.057
LESSONS LEARNED IN LOOKING AT

00:42:07.124 --> 00:42:08.525
HOW WE CAN IMPLEMENT THAT.

00:42:08.592 --> 00:42:10.594
INTO OUR COMMUNITY MORE

00:42:10.661 --> 00:42:11.629
EXTENSIVELY.

00:42:11.695 --> 00:42:13.197
MOVING FORWARD.

00:42:13.264 --> 00:42:15.065
AND THEN WE'VE ALSO -- INITIATE

00:42:15.132 --> 00:42:17.501
A COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS AND

00:42:17.568 --> 00:42:18.602
THESE ARE AREAS THAT WOULD BE

00:42:18.669 --> 00:42:20.337
PRONE TO THESE PUBLIC SAFETY

00:42:20.404 --> 00:42:21.705
POWER SHOT OFFICE.

00:42:21.772 --> 00:42:24.508
AND HOW WE HAVE IT SET UP NOW WE

00:42:24.575 --> 00:42:25.876
WOULD BRING A GENERATOR OUT TO

00:42:25.943 --> 00:42:27.978
THIS AREA AND KEEP A COMMUNITY

00:42:28.045 --> 00:42:30.147
CENTER ENERGIZED WE HAVE

00:42:30.214 --> 00:42:31.081
REPRESENTATIVES THERE THAT COULD

00:42:31.148 --> 00:42:33.217
GIVE INFORMATION BUT THEN ALSO

00:42:33.284 --> 00:42:34.718
CHARGE CELLPHONES.

00:42:34.785 --> 00:42:36.620
WE'VE BROUGHT ICE TRUCKS WATER

00:42:36.687 --> 00:42:38.055
TRUCKS THINGS THAT WE CAN

00:42:38.122 --> 00:42:39.757
PROVIDE SOME RESOURCES TO THIS

00:42:39.823 --> 00:42:41.926
COMMUNITY WE OPEN SIX OF THEM

00:42:41.992 --> 00:42:43.160
LAST YEAR.

00:42:43.227 --> 00:42:45.029
WAS VERY WELL RECEIVED -- WE'RE

00:42:45.095 --> 00:42:46.997
EXPANDING THAT THIS YEAR WILL BE

00:42:47.064 --> 00:42:50.734
UP -- TO ELEVEN BY THIS YEAR --

00:42:50.801 --> 00:42:52.670
BUT OTHER THINGS WERE CONTINUING

00:42:52.736 --> 00:42:54.805
TO MOVE WE DO FEEL THAT --

00:42:54.872 --> 00:42:56.640
MICROGRAMS HAVE A PLACE IN

00:42:56.707 --> 00:42:58.676
RESILIENCE IN THE BACK COUNTRY

00:42:58.742 --> 00:42:59.743
OF SAN DIEGO.

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:02.212
SO I DRAW THE ATTENTION TO

00:43:02.279 --> 00:43:05.783
ASSEMBLY BILL -- TWENTY EIGHT

00:43:05.849 --> 00:43:06.717
SIXTY EIGHT WHICH RIGHT NOW IS

00:43:06.784 --> 00:43:09.019
TRYING TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT

00:43:09.086 --> 00:43:10.154
SOME STORAGE AND BATTERY AT SOME

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:11.956
SUBSTATIONS ONE OF THOSE

00:43:12.022 --> 00:43:13.924
SUBSTATIONS AS BOULEVARD IT'S IN

00:43:13.991 --> 00:43:16.460
A HIGH FIRE RISK AREA -- THAT WE

00:43:16.527 --> 00:43:20.597
OPERATE -- AND RIGHT NOW WITH

00:43:20.664 --> 00:43:21.899
WITH THIS IT'S SAYING THAT IT

00:43:21.966 --> 00:43:23.534
DOES HAVE TO GO OUT FOR BIDS SO

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.035
WE'RE LOOKING AT A TWO TO THREE

00:43:25.102 --> 00:43:25.769
YEAR DELAY.

00:43:25.836 --> 00:43:27.771
BASED OFF THE PROPOSED DECISION

00:43:27.838 --> 00:43:29.473
FROM THE P. YOU SEE RIGHT NOW.

00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:31.408
TO GET THIS IMPLEMENTED SO WE

00:43:31.475 --> 00:43:32.776
FEEL LIKE THIS IS A A REAL

00:43:32.843 --> 00:43:34.712
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO START

00:43:34.778 --> 00:43:35.846
MAKING.

00:43:35.913 --> 00:43:38.549
SOME MORE PROGRESS ON RESILIENCE

00:43:38.615 --> 00:43:39.817
OF THE BACK COUNTRY.

00:43:39.883 --> 00:43:41.051
AND THEN THE LAST POINT THAT I

00:43:41.118 --> 00:43:42.653
WANTED TO MAKE TODAY BEFORE

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:44.455
CONCLUDING IS THAT THE THE WILD

00:43:44.521 --> 00:43:45.956
FIRE MITIGATION PLANS OF COURSE

00:43:46.023 --> 00:43:48.158
THE PROPOSED DECISION HAS BEEN

00:43:48.225 --> 00:43:48.926
PUT FORTH.

00:43:48.993 --> 00:43:51.595
AND OVERALL THE DECISION IS THAT

00:43:51.662 --> 00:43:53.597
IT HAS DECIDED TO BE FUNDED

00:43:53.664 --> 00:43:56.633
THROUGH THE G. R. C. -- WHICH WE

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:58.102
THINK IS COMPLETELY APPROPRIATE

00:43:58.168 --> 00:44:00.437
AND RIGHT NOW THAT THE G. R. C.

00:44:00.504 --> 00:44:02.373
FOR US THE GENIE WAS DUE BY THE

00:44:02.439 --> 00:44:04.608
END OF LAST YEAR -- SO WE ARE

00:44:04.675 --> 00:44:07.644
RIGHT NOW SIX MONTHS.

00:44:07.711 --> 00:44:09.246
BEHIND SCHEDULE ON THAT.

00:44:09.313 --> 00:44:10.614
NOT THAT IS NOT IN ANY WAY SHAPE

00:44:10.681 --> 00:44:12.516
OR FORM SLOWING DOWN OUR

00:44:12.583 --> 00:44:14.051
PROGRESS ON OUR WILD FIRE

00:44:14.118 --> 00:44:15.919
MITIGATION PLAN -- BUT AT THE

00:44:15.986 --> 00:44:17.187
SAME TIME FOR THE OVERALL

00:44:17.254 --> 00:44:18.555
FINANCIAL HEALTH AND AND

00:44:18.622 --> 00:44:20.591
STABILITY WE THINK TIMELY

00:44:20.657 --> 00:44:22.259
RESPONSE TO THE G. R. C. IS

00:44:22.326 --> 00:44:23.160
IMPORTANT.

00:44:23.227 --> 00:44:24.661
AND EVEN MORE SO WITH THE RECENT

00:44:24.728 --> 00:44:27.297
PASSING OF SENATE BILL --

00:44:27.364 --> 00:44:28.165
FOURTEEN TEN WE THINK THAT RIGHT

00:44:28.232 --> 00:44:29.700
NOW THE COMMISSION HAS THE

00:44:29.767 --> 00:44:31.969
ABILITY TO EXTEND OUR THREE YEAR

00:44:32.036 --> 00:44:34.605
G. R. C. TO A FOUR YEAR G. R. C..

00:44:34.671 --> 00:44:36.240
AND WHAT THAT WOULD DO IS THAT

00:44:36.306 --> 00:44:38.642
IF WE HAVE DELAYS LIKE THIS IT

00:44:38.709 --> 00:44:42.046
WOULD BE LESS IMPACTFUL --

00:44:42.112 --> 00:44:43.147
GENERAL RATE CASE THANK YOU THE

00:44:43.213 --> 00:44:44.848
GENERAL RATE CASE BEING LATE

00:44:44.915 --> 00:44:47.051
WOULD BE LESS IMPACTFUL -- IF WE

00:44:47.117 --> 00:44:50.254
DID HAVE A FOUR YEAR -- GENERAL

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:51.522
RATE CASE CYCLE.

00:44:51.588 --> 00:44:54.792
SO WITH THAT I WILL CONCLUDE AND

00:44:54.858 --> 00:44:56.326
LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING ANY

00:44:56.393 --> 00:44:57.294
QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE.

00:44:57.361 --> 00:44:59.263
THANK YOU.

00:44:59.329 --> 00:45:00.064
AND I APPRECIATE YOUR

00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:01.765
PRESENTATION AND I THINK IT'S

00:45:01.832 --> 00:45:03.300
SAFE TO SAY THAT THERE WILL BE

00:45:03.367 --> 00:45:05.135
ACRONYMS OF USE THAT WILL

00:45:05.202 --> 00:45:06.537
COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND.

00:45:06.603 --> 00:45:08.405
BUT THE PUBLIC WATCHING PROBABLY

00:45:08.472 --> 00:45:10.374
WILL NOT HAVE A CLUE SO IF YOU

00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:12.776
CAN JUST SORT OF YOU KNOW DUMB

00:45:12.843 --> 00:45:13.644
IT DOWN JUST A LITTLE BIT I

00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:15.012
THINK I SHOULD SAY LIKE THAT BUT

00:45:15.079 --> 00:45:17.347
MAKE IT MORE UNDERSTANDABLE.

00:45:17.414 --> 00:45:19.249
FOR OTHERS WHO ARE WATCHING I

00:45:19.316 --> 00:45:21.318
THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL

00:45:21.385 --> 00:45:25.989
POINT TAKEN THANK YOU.

00:45:26.056 --> 00:45:27.357
CHURCHILL HOLDEN ASSEMBLY

00:45:27.424 --> 00:45:29.126
MEMBERS -- UNTIL HARRINGTON DOES

CALIFORNIA EDISON -- WANT TO

BEFORE -- I COMMITTEE EARLIER

00:45:39.903 --> 00:45:41.905
LAST YEAR LATE LAST YEAR -- TALK

00:45:41.972 --> 00:45:43.207
ABOUT A WHILE FIRE MITIGATION

00:45:43.273 --> 00:45:45.375
PLANNING PROGRAMS -- SO THIS IS

00:45:45.442 --> 00:45:46.143
SOMETHING OF AN UPDATE BUT

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:47.611
THERE'S A LOT OF NEW INFORMATION

00:45:47.678 --> 00:45:49.346
HERE AS WELL AND OF COURSE -- AS

00:45:49.413 --> 00:45:50.714
UTILITIES WE DO LOVE OUR ACRONYM

00:45:50.781 --> 00:45:53.417
SO I WILL DO MY BEST -- TO TO

00:45:53.484 --> 00:45:54.551
ELIMINATE THEM FROM THEIR

00:45:54.618 --> 00:45:58.989
PRESENTATION BUT IF I MISS --

00:45:59.056 --> 00:45:59.890
PLEASE LET ME KNOW.

00:45:59.957 --> 00:46:01.258
SO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:46:01.325 --> 00:46:02.626
TODAY ARE WHILE FIRE MITIGATION

00:46:02.693 --> 00:46:04.728
PLANS THAT AS HE IS PUT IN PLACE.

00:46:04.795 --> 00:46:06.563
AND MAYBE TO TAKE A STEP BACK WE

00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:07.197
WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

00:46:07.264 --> 00:46:09.066
THE BACKGROUND OF SOME OF THE

00:46:09.133 --> 00:46:10.334
PLANS HOW THEY'VE COME TO BE.

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:11.768
AND HOW WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THE

00:46:11.835 --> 00:46:14.138
FUTURE OF OUR PLANS OF OVER

00:46:14.204 --> 00:46:15.239
IMPLEMENTING RIGHT NOW.

00:46:15.305 --> 00:46:16.773
THEY BUILD UPON -- PROGRAMS

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:18.375
WE'VE HAD FOR MANY YEARS --

00:46:18.442 --> 00:46:19.843
THINGS WE'VE DONE IN RESPONSE TO

00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:22.112
RED FLAG WARNINGS -- THIS IS --

00:46:22.179 --> 00:46:23.480
INCIPIENT CONDITIONS OF HIGH

00:46:23.547 --> 00:46:25.215
FIRE RISK -- WE HAVE

00:46:25.282 --> 00:46:26.850
TRADITIONALLY HAD DESIGN

00:46:26.917 --> 00:46:28.318
STANDARDS WERE DIFFERENT AND OUR

00:46:28.385 --> 00:46:29.620
HIGH FAR AREAS OPERATIONAL

00:46:29.686 --> 00:46:31.121
PRACTICES AROUND VEGETATION

00:46:31.188 --> 00:46:33.690
MANAGEMENT -- OPERATIONS IN

00:46:33.757 --> 00:46:35.058
TERMS OF BLOCKING A RE CLOSER TO

00:46:35.125 --> 00:46:36.126
I BELIEVE WE'RE THE FIRST

00:46:36.193 --> 00:46:37.995
UTILITY TO PUT THOSE IN PLACE --

00:46:38.061 --> 00:46:40.130
MANY YEARS AGO -- SO WE HAD A

00:46:40.197 --> 00:46:41.832
LOT OF PROGRAMS IN PLACE BUT WE

00:46:41.899 --> 00:46:43.734
RECOGNIZE OBVIOUSLY WITH THE

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:45.102
LAST COUPLE OF YEARS -- THAT'S

00:46:45.169 --> 00:46:46.503
NOT ENOUGH SO TO PROTECT OUR

00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:48.939
COMMUNITIES OUR CUSTOMERS AND

00:46:49.006 --> 00:46:49.506
OUR EMPLOYEES LIVE IN THOSE

00:46:49.573 --> 00:46:51.375
COMMUNITIES -- WE NEED TO DO

00:46:51.441 --> 00:46:52.342
MORE AND THAT'S WHAT THE PLAN

00:46:52.409 --> 00:46:54.878
WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT TODAY

00:46:54.945 --> 00:46:56.446
WILL BE ABOUT.

00:46:56.513 --> 00:46:57.281
AS WE LOOK FORWARD WE BROADLY

00:46:57.347 --> 00:46:59.483
CATEGORIZE THINGS -- ACROSS

00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:01.151
THREE ELEMENTS -- HARDING

00:47:01.218 --> 00:47:02.886
INFRASTRUCTURE -- BOLSTER

00:47:02.953 --> 00:47:04.421
SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND

00:47:04.488 --> 00:47:05.289
ENHANCING OUR OPERATIONAL

00:47:05.355 --> 00:47:06.523
PRACTICES WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:10.227
ABOUT EACH ONE OF THOSE -- AS WE

00:47:10.294 --> 00:47:10.694
AS WE ROLL THROUGH THE

00:47:10.761 --> 00:47:12.896
DISCUSSION HERE.

00:47:12.963 --> 00:47:15.732
SO -- WANTING OF THESE IMPORTANT --

00:47:15.799 --> 00:47:17.668
SIZE AND SCOPE OF OUR SYSTEMS --

00:47:17.734 --> 00:47:19.102
WE HAVE A FIFTY THOUSAND MILE

00:47:19.169 --> 00:47:20.437
SERVICE TERRITORY AND ABOUT A

00:47:20.504 --> 00:47:21.605
THIRD OF THAT IS IN HIGH FIRE

00:47:21.672 --> 00:47:22.706
RISK AREA.

00:47:22.773 --> 00:47:23.807
SO THE SCOPE AND SCALE OF THE

00:47:23.874 --> 00:47:25.242
INFRASTRUCTURE WERE ADDRESSING

00:47:25.309 --> 00:47:27.544
IS VERY LARGE -- WE HAVE AROUND

00:47:27.611 --> 00:47:28.812
A MILLION TREES IN OUR TRIM

00:47:28.879 --> 00:47:31.615
INVENTORY -- FOUR HUNDRED

00:47:31.682 --> 00:47:32.249
THOUSAND THOSE ARE IN HIGH FIRE

00:47:32.316 --> 00:47:33.584
AREAS AND FRANKLY THAT NUMBER

00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:35.219
WILL INCREASE AS WE IMPLEMENT

00:47:35.285 --> 00:47:36.620
EVEN MORE AGGRESSIVE PROGRAMS TO

00:47:36.687 --> 00:47:38.288
TRAIN VEGETATION.

00:47:38.355 --> 00:47:40.290
IN THE HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS --

00:47:40.357 --> 00:47:41.558
SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF

00:47:41.625 --> 00:47:43.327
INFRASTRUCTURE A LOT OF AREA AND

00:47:43.393 --> 00:47:45.128
WE'RE MOVING VERY QUICKLY -- TO

00:47:45.195 --> 00:47:48.532
OUR PROGRAMS -- TO ADDRESS ALL

00:47:48.599 --> 00:47:50.400
OF THAT TERRITORY.

00:47:50.467 --> 00:47:51.902
SO ONE OF THINGS FOR US THAT IS

00:47:51.969 --> 00:47:53.704
REALLY CRITICAL -- AND I THINK

00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:54.638
IT'S CRITICAL FOR EVERYBODY TO

00:47:54.705 --> 00:47:57.074
UNDERSTAND IS HOW WE APPROACH --

00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:59.977
WHERE AND WHEN AND HOW WE INVEST

00:48:00.043 --> 00:48:00.477
AND IMPROVE OPERATIONAL

00:48:00.544 --> 00:48:02.846
PRACTICES -- WE DO THIS THROUGH

00:48:02.913 --> 00:48:05.549
A RISK INFORMED ONES -- WE HAVE

00:48:05.616 --> 00:48:07.618
EVOLVED OUR RISK MANAGEMENT ON A

00:48:07.684 --> 00:48:09.987
RISK ASSESSMENT TECHNOLOGY WE'RE

00:48:10.053 --> 00:48:11.521
USING MORE MORE MACHINE LEARNING

00:48:11.588 --> 00:48:13.357
AND HOW WE DRESS AND LOOK AT OUR

00:48:13.423 --> 00:48:14.825
CIRCUITS ARE PERFORMING.

00:48:14.891 --> 00:48:16.460
UNDER HIGH -- IN EXTREME

00:48:16.526 --> 00:48:17.527
CONDITIONS ALL THIS IS HELPING

00:48:17.594 --> 00:48:19.730
TO INFORM WHERE AND WHEN AND

00:48:19.796 --> 00:48:21.231
WHAT WE DO TO OUR SYSTEM.

00:48:21.298 --> 00:48:23.934
IF WE THINK ABOUT A FOR OUR

00:48:24.001 --> 00:48:24.635
SYSTEM.

00:48:24.701 --> 00:48:25.802
MOST OF THE CONSEQUENTIAL EVENTS

00:48:25.869 --> 00:48:28.138
THAT HAPPENED RELATIVE -- TO

00:48:28.205 --> 00:48:29.439
IGNITIONS ARE SYSTEM OCCUR ON

00:48:29.506 --> 00:48:31.241
THE DISTRIBUTION SIDE WE DO HAVE

00:48:31.308 --> 00:48:32.743
SOME TRANSMISSION BUT THE BULK

00:48:32.809 --> 00:48:34.211
OF THOSE AROUND DISTRIBUTION AS

00:48:34.278 --> 00:48:35.145
WELL I WILL SEE A LOT OF

00:48:35.212 --> 00:48:37.180
DISCUSSION TODAY FOCUSED ON WHAT

00:48:37.247 --> 00:48:37.814
WE'RE DOING ON THE DISTRIBUTION

00:48:37.881 --> 00:48:38.649
SIDE.

00:48:38.715 --> 00:48:40.284
WE DO HAVE MANY PROGRAMS AND

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:41.918
MANY OF OUR PROGRAMS DO ADDRESS

00:48:41.985 --> 00:48:43.153
TRANSMISSION AS WELL BUT IF YOU

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:44.087
WONDER WHY THERE'S A

00:48:44.154 --> 00:48:46.857
DISTRIBUTION FOCUS IT'S REALLY

00:48:46.923 --> 00:48:50.193
BASED ON A RISK INFORMED LANCE

00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:50.494
[inaudible]

00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:53.263
SO -- WITHIN THAT CATEGORY IS

00:48:53.330 --> 00:48:54.131
ATION THE THREE BUCKETS

00:48:54.197 --> 00:48:55.599
SITUATIONAL AWARENESS OPERATION

00:48:55.666 --> 00:48:57.868
PRACTICES -- INFRASTRUCTURE

00:48:57.934 --> 00:48:59.903
IMPROVEMENT -- THERE'S ALSO TO

00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:01.271
BROADWAY'S WE THINK ABOUT

00:49:01.338 --> 00:49:02.606
MITIGATION TERMS OF

00:49:02.673 --> 00:49:04.541
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEN IN TERMS

00:49:04.608 --> 00:49:06.376
OF OPERATING PRACTICES -- AS WE

00:49:06.443 --> 00:49:07.878
PUT TOGETHER THE WALL FIRE

00:49:07.944 --> 00:49:09.980
MITIGATION PLANS AND SUBMITTED

00:49:10.047 --> 00:49:11.415
OUR FIRST ONE THIS YEAR.

00:49:11.481 --> 00:49:12.916
UNDER THE NEW FORMAT.

00:49:12.983 --> 00:49:14.251
IT WAS A COMBINATION OF

00:49:14.318 --> 00:49:16.353
SOMETHING WE FILED LATE LAST

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:17.788
YEAR -- OUR GREAT STATE CAN

00:49:17.854 --> 00:49:19.623
RESULT SEE PLAN AND SO MANY

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:21.091
THINGS YOU MAY HAVE SEEN.

00:49:21.158 --> 00:49:21.992
INTRODUCED IN WHILE FAR

00:49:22.059 --> 00:49:23.593
MITIGATION PLAN ACTUALLY HAD

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:24.761
THEIR START INTEGRATES

00:49:24.828 --> 00:49:26.129
RESILIENCY PLAN THAT WE

00:49:26.196 --> 00:49:29.633
SUBMITTED LAST.

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:30.801
DECEMBER OR LAST SEPTEMBER.

00:49:30.867 --> 00:49:31.368
THE REASON I STRESS THAT IS

00:49:31.435 --> 00:49:32.836
BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT EVEN

00:49:32.903 --> 00:49:34.404
THOUGH THERE WAS A MITIGATION

00:49:34.471 --> 00:49:35.939
PLAN COMING WE WANT TO GET

00:49:36.006 --> 00:49:38.508
STARTED EARLY EVEN BEFORE WE

00:49:38.575 --> 00:49:39.876
FATHER GREAT SAFETY RESERVE IT

00:49:39.943 --> 00:49:41.945
PLAN WE BEGAN AGGRESSIVELY IN

00:49:42.012 --> 00:49:43.280
INVESTING IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE

00:49:43.347 --> 00:49:45.649
AND DOING THINGS -- EVEN MORE TO

00:49:45.716 --> 00:49:47.250
PREVENT AND MITIGATE THE IMPACT

00:49:47.317 --> 00:49:48.385
OF WILDFIRES.

00:49:48.452 --> 00:49:49.386
SO SOME OF THESE ARE GOING TO

00:49:49.453 --> 00:49:51.154
TALK ABOUT INSULATED CONDUCTORS

00:49:51.221 --> 00:49:52.122
WE REFER TO THOSE DISCOVER

00:49:52.189 --> 00:49:53.790
CONDUCTORS LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT

00:49:53.857 --> 00:49:55.292
THOSE INSULATED CONDUCTORS --

00:49:55.359 --> 00:49:57.227
OTHER MEDICATIONS LIKE COMPOSITE

00:49:57.294 --> 00:49:58.895
POLES AND REMOVED OPERATIONAL

00:49:58.962 --> 00:50:00.597
PRACTICES WILL TALK ABOUT MANY

00:50:00.664 --> 00:50:02.499
THINGS WERE DOING THERE AND AND

00:50:02.566 --> 00:50:05.001
WE REALLY ARE DOING -- MUCH MUCH

00:50:05.068 --> 00:50:06.269
MORE IN MANY SPACES WE'RE GONNA

00:50:06.336 --> 00:50:08.138
COME TO THAT VERY QUICKLY AND

00:50:08.205 --> 00:50:11.675
AND HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO DRESS

00:50:11.742 --> 00:50:12.309
SOME QUESTIONS AS IT RELATES TO

00:50:12.376 --> 00:50:13.377
THE START WITH HARDING OUR

00:50:13.443 --> 00:50:14.244
INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:50:14.311 --> 00:50:16.380
ALREADY WE'VE INSTALLED AROUND A

00:50:16.446 --> 00:50:17.013
HUNDRED SEVENTY MILES A WHAT WE

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:20.283
CALL -- INSULATED CONDUCTORS SO

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:22.018
AGAIN WHY DO WE COME TO THIS --

00:50:22.085 --> 00:50:23.787
WE LOOKED AT THE CAUSES OF

00:50:23.854 --> 00:50:26.189
IGNITIONS THAT MAY RESULT FROM

00:50:26.256 --> 00:50:27.124
OUR SYSTEM.

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:29.326
AND AT LEAST HALF OF THEM RESULT

00:50:29.393 --> 00:50:32.095
FROM CONTACT WITH OUR EQUIPMENT

00:50:32.162 --> 00:50:34.131
AND MATTER SEARCHES --

00:50:34.197 --> 00:50:36.199
VEGETATION BLOWING IN -- MYLAR

00:50:36.266 --> 00:50:38.435
BALLOONS OTHER THINGS COME INTO

00:50:38.502 --> 00:50:39.569
CONTACT WITH THE ELECTRICAL

00:50:39.636 --> 00:50:40.971
EQUIPMENT SO THAT'S ONE SOURCE

00:50:41.037 --> 00:50:43.073
WIRE TO WIRE CONTACT IS ANOTHER

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:44.408
AND THEN ACQUITTED FAILURES.

00:50:44.474 --> 00:50:46.777
BY DRESSING COVER CONDUCTOR OR

00:50:46.843 --> 00:50:48.178
INSULATED CONDUCTORS WE'VE

00:50:48.245 --> 00:50:50.380
TARGET ROUGHLY 70% OF THE CAUSES

00:50:50.447 --> 00:50:51.948
OF IGNITIONS OUR SYSTEM THIS IS

00:50:52.015 --> 00:50:54.651
A VERY IMPACTFUL AND MEANINGFUL

00:50:54.718 --> 00:50:54.885
CHANGE.

00:50:54.951 --> 00:50:56.219
CRIME FOR STRUCTURE WE CAN ABOUT

00:50:56.286 --> 00:50:57.554
THIS BOTH BY LOOKING AT THE

00:50:57.621 --> 00:50:59.189
SOURCES OF IGNITIONS AND ALSO

00:50:59.256 --> 00:51:00.557
BENCHMARKING NOT ONLY HERE IN

00:51:00.624 --> 00:51:01.324
THE U. S..

00:51:01.391 --> 00:51:02.793
BUT OVERSEAS AS WELL TO WHERE

00:51:02.859 --> 00:51:04.161
THEY HAVE WHILE FIRE ISSUES AND

00:51:04.227 --> 00:51:07.931
SEEING THAT THIS IS A PRACTICE

00:51:07.998 --> 00:51:10.200
THAT CAN BE EFFECTIVE.

00:51:10.267 --> 00:51:11.168
OTHER THINGS WERE DOING AN

00:51:11.234 --> 00:51:13.770
INFRASTRUCTURE PLACE A SPACE.

00:51:13.837 --> 00:51:15.005
FUSES SO ANOTHER WAY YOU CAN

00:51:15.071 --> 00:51:16.840
LIMIT THE THREAD OF SET OF

00:51:16.907 --> 00:51:17.474
IGNITIONS ON YOUR SYSTEM IS BY

00:51:17.541 --> 00:51:18.875
MINIMIZING HE AMOUNT OF ENERGY

00:51:18.942 --> 00:51:20.710
THAT'S TRANSMITTED. TO FLAMMABLE

00:51:20.777 --> 00:51:22.946
MATERIAL WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS

00:51:23.013 --> 00:51:24.648
SO WE DO THIS BY SECTIONAL LIES

00:51:24.714 --> 00:51:26.550
IN THE SYSTEM CUTTING INTO MORE

00:51:26.616 --> 00:51:27.984
MORE SMALLER PIECES SO.

00:51:28.051 --> 00:51:29.519
BOTH WHEN THERE'S AN EVENT ON

00:51:29.586 --> 00:51:31.154
THE SYSTEM IT REACTS MUCH MORE

00:51:31.221 --> 00:51:33.390
QUICKLY BUT ALSO SO THAT WHEN

00:51:33.457 --> 00:51:35.125
THE ENERGY TRANSMITTED INTO THE

00:51:35.192 --> 00:51:36.793
SYSTEM OR INTO THE GROUND WHEN

00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:38.061
THERE IS AN EVENT.

00:51:38.128 --> 00:51:40.664
THE THE ENERGY TRANSFER JUST

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:42.299
MUCH LOWER LOWER IGNITION THREAT --

00:51:42.365 --> 00:51:42.899
ONE OTHER THING I'D LIKE TO

00:51:42.966 --> 00:51:44.501
HIGHLIGHT ON THE DATA ANALYTICS

00:51:44.568 --> 00:51:46.069
PIECE -- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

00:51:46.136 --> 00:51:47.737
HAS APPLICATIONS TO BOTH PUBLIC

00:51:47.804 --> 00:51:49.773
SAFETY OUTSIDE A WILDFIRE BUT

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.107
WITHIN MODIFIERS WELL.

00:51:51.174 --> 00:51:52.442
WE HAVE DEVELOPED ALGORITHMS

00:51:52.509 --> 00:51:54.144
WITHIN WHAT WE CALL OUR

00:51:54.211 --> 00:51:56.079
RELIABILITY OPERATIONS CENTER

00:51:56.146 --> 00:51:57.380
THAT TARGET DID THE

00:51:57.447 --> 00:51:59.182
PERTURBATIONS ON THE SYSTEM THAT

00:51:59.249 --> 00:52:01.318
WE RECEIVE AND SEE FROM OUR

00:52:01.384 --> 00:52:02.419
SMART METERS. TO METERS THAT

00:52:02.486 --> 00:52:04.521
HAVE TYPICALLY BEEN USED TO

00:52:04.588 --> 00:52:06.423
IDENTIFY -- REVENUE REQUIREMENTS

00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:11.261
OR REVENUE -- MATTERS OVER --

00:52:11.328 --> 00:52:12.696
DIFFERENT HOURS.

00:52:12.762 --> 00:52:13.663
WE'RE ALSO USING THOSE TO TAKE

00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:14.564
THE VOLTAGE INFORMATION TO COME

00:52:14.631 --> 00:52:14.865
FROM THOSE.

00:52:14.931 --> 00:52:15.432
AND IDENTIFY WHEN THERE'S A

00:52:15.499 --> 00:52:17.300
SITUATION GOING ON OUR SYSTEM

00:52:17.367 --> 00:52:20.003
AND TAKING PROACTIVE -- STEPS TO

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:21.705
DE ENERGIZED AT SO -- WE

00:52:21.771 --> 00:52:24.007
RECENTLY ESTIMATED THATTO E.

00:52:24.074 --> 00:52:25.442
I'D ACTUALLY WERE FINALISTS TO

00:52:25.509 --> 00:52:26.409
FIND THEIR COMPETITION FOR AN

00:52:26.476 --> 00:52:27.344
EDISON AWARDS SO THIS IS A

00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:29.012
GROUNDBREAKING TECHNOLOGY THAT

00:52:29.079 --> 00:52:32.082
WE'RE BRINGING. TO WILDFIRE IN

00:52:32.148 --> 00:52:33.817
PUBLIC SAFETY.

00:52:33.884 --> 00:52:34.885
SO SITUATIONAL AWARENESS -- THIS

00:52:34.951 --> 00:52:35.952
IS SOMETHING WERE ALSO VERY

00:52:36.019 --> 00:52:38.355
AGGRESSIVELY MOVING FORWARD AND

00:52:38.421 --> 00:52:40.390
BOTH WEATHER STATIONS.

00:52:40.457 --> 00:52:42.459
HIGH DEFINITION CAMERAS AND

00:52:42.526 --> 00:52:43.693
OVERALL PRACTICES AND USE OF

00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:45.362
DATA WE'VE INVESTED INTO SUPER

00:52:45.428 --> 00:52:47.397
COMPUTERS TO HELP US WITH

00:52:47.464 --> 00:52:50.100
COMPLEX WHETHER ANALYTICS -- IN

00:52:50.166 --> 00:52:52.435
TERMS OF CAMERAS -- WE ALREADY

00:52:52.502 --> 00:52:54.738
EXPECT TO HAVE AROUND 90%

00:52:54.804 --> 00:52:55.539
COVERAGE OF A HIGH FIRE RISK

00:52:55.605 --> 00:52:56.640
AREAS BY THE END OF THIS YEAR

00:52:56.706 --> 00:52:58.508
THAT'S A TOTAL A HUNDRED SIXTY

00:52:58.575 --> 00:52:59.376
CAMERAS.

00:52:59.442 --> 00:53:01.478
NOW WE HAVE AROUND 6% COVERAGE

00:53:01.545 --> 00:53:02.846
WITH OVER A HUNDRED CAMERAS ON

00:53:02.913 --> 00:53:04.414
OUR TERRITORY.

00:53:04.481 --> 00:53:05.048
REMEMBER THE SCOPE AND SCALE OF

00:53:05.115 --> 00:53:06.716
OUR OF OUR SERVICE TERRITORY IS

00:53:06.783 --> 00:53:09.853
EXTREMELY LARGE. 35% OF THAT IS

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:11.855
THE FIFTY THOUSAND SQUARE MILES

00:53:11.922 --> 00:53:13.123
IS HIGH FIRE RISK AREA THESE ARE

00:53:13.189 --> 00:53:15.258
THE TERRITORIES WERE TARGETING

00:53:15.325 --> 00:53:15.759
WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:53:15.825 --> 00:53:17.994
INVESTMENT -- WEATHER STATIONS --

00:53:18.061 --> 00:53:19.396
BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY WE

00:53:19.462 --> 00:53:21.064
EXPECT TO HAVE AROUND EIGHT

00:53:21.131 --> 00:53:22.165
HUNDRED FIFTY OF THESE DEPLOYED --

00:53:22.232 --> 00:53:23.833
WE ALREADY HAVE OVER TWO HUNDRED

00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:26.136
DEPLOYED AND WE'RE TARGETING

00:53:26.202 --> 00:53:27.270
FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY BY.

00:53:27.337 --> 00:53:27.771
TWENTY NINETY THESE ARE

00:53:27.837 --> 00:53:29.105
ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL BECAUSE NOT

00:53:29.172 --> 00:53:30.307
ONLY DO THEY PROVIDE PROVIDE

00:53:30.373 --> 00:53:32.742
GROUND LEVEL INFORMATION ON

00:53:32.809 --> 00:53:33.610
WHAT'S GOING ON ARE CIRCUITS

00:53:33.677 --> 00:53:34.945
THAT WILL HELP US.

00:53:35.011 --> 00:53:36.279
MAKE DECISIONS AROUND PUBLIC

00:53:36.346 --> 00:53:37.514
SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF.

00:53:37.581 --> 00:53:38.481
THEY ALSO HELP US WITH WEATHER

00:53:38.548 --> 00:53:40.083
MONITORING BECAUSE WE NOW HAVE

00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:41.785
EVEN MORE GRANULAR INFORMATION

00:53:41.851 --> 00:53:43.386
ON WHAT'S GOING ON IN A VERY

00:53:43.453 --> 00:53:44.788
MICRO LOCATIONS ACROSS OUR

00:53:44.854 --> 00:53:49.826
SYSTEM SO THIS IS.

00:53:49.893 --> 00:53:50.393
THIS IS A REAL GAME CHANGER

00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:51.795
FORCE.

00:53:51.861 --> 00:53:52.629
WE MOVED OPERATIONAL PRACTICES

00:53:52.696 --> 00:53:53.363
AND THERE'S A COUPLE OF

00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:53.964
DIMENSIONS HERE THAT I REALLY

00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:55.398
WANT TO POINT OUT. ONE OF THE

00:53:55.465 --> 00:53:57.367
THINGS WE OBSERVED -- AND WE

00:53:57.434 --> 00:53:59.536
HAVE HISTORICALLY -- FOCUSED

00:53:59.603 --> 00:54:01.338
MUCH OF OUR ATTENTION ON

00:54:01.404 --> 00:54:03.373
COMPLIANCE AND WE'VE DONE A VERY

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:04.374
GOOD JOB COMPLIANCE OVER THE

00:54:04.441 --> 00:54:06.509
YEARS -- THAT'S BEEN A STANDARD

00:54:06.576 --> 00:54:07.677
THAT I THINK IT'S HELPED US WE

00:54:07.744 --> 00:54:08.812
HAVE USE RISK INFORMATION TO

00:54:08.878 --> 00:54:10.480
HELP GUIDE US THERE.

00:54:10.547 --> 00:54:11.314
BUT WHAT WE'RE SHIFTING TO NOW

00:54:11.381 --> 00:54:13.350
IS A PREDOMINATELY A RISK INFORM

00:54:13.416 --> 00:54:14.851
WAY OF LOOKING AT OUR CIRCUITRY.

00:54:14.918 --> 00:54:16.052
WHAT THIS LED US TO CONCLUDE

00:54:16.119 --> 00:54:18.088
THIS YEAR WAS THAT WE DON'T WANT

00:54:18.154 --> 00:54:19.222
TO GO INTO ANOTHER FIRE SEASON

00:54:19.289 --> 00:54:21.024
WITHOUT HAVING EYES ON EVERY

00:54:21.091 --> 00:54:22.325
SQUARE MILE OR EVERY MILE?

00:54:22.392 --> 00:54:24.761
OF OUR CIRCUITRY SO WITH THAT IN

00:54:24.828 --> 00:54:25.996
THE END OF DECEMBER WE LAUNCH

00:54:26.062 --> 00:54:27.497
ENHANCE OVERHEAD INSPECTION

00:54:27.564 --> 00:54:29.466
PROGRAM WE LOOKED AT AND THIS

00:54:29.532 --> 00:54:31.401
WAS BY QUALIFIED ELECTRICAL

00:54:31.468 --> 00:54:31.968
WORKERS.

00:54:32.035 --> 00:54:33.336
LINEMAN TROUBLE MAN PEOPLE WHO

00:54:33.403 --> 00:54:35.739
DO THIS FOR A LIVING AND

00:54:35.805 --> 00:54:36.339
UNDERSTAND HOW THE SYSTEM TO

00:54:36.406 --> 00:54:37.240
WORK.

00:54:37.307 --> 00:54:39.242
THEY INSPECTED OVER FOUR HUNDRED

00:54:39.309 --> 00:54:40.477
THOUSAND STRUCTURES AND WE

00:54:40.543 --> 00:54:41.745
BROUGHT TECHNOLOGY TO BEAR AS

00:54:41.811 --> 00:54:43.747
WELL WITH THE PORTABLE DEVICES

00:54:43.813 --> 00:54:45.882
THAT THEY COULD LOG INSPECTED

00:54:45.949 --> 00:54:46.916
TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS OF INFORMATION

00:54:46.983 --> 00:54:48.618
ON OUR EVEN MOVING MORE

00:54:48.685 --> 00:54:49.919
AGGRESSIVELY.

00:54:49.986 --> 00:54:51.154
WITH AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY WERE

00:54:51.221 --> 00:54:53.657
USING HELICOPTERS AND DRONES

00:54:53.723 --> 00:54:55.125
TODAY HIGH DEFINITION IMAGES

00:54:55.191 --> 00:54:56.693
INFRARED CAMERA SCANS SOMETHING

00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:58.361
CALLED CORONA IMAGES ALLOW YOU

00:54:58.428 --> 00:55:00.563
TO SEE FAULTS -- LIKE DETECTING

00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:02.499
ARRANGING TO HELP US IDENTIFY

00:55:02.565 --> 00:55:04.334
VEGETATION ENCROACHMENTS ANOTHER

00:55:04.401 --> 00:55:06.870
DEFECTS OUR SYSTEM ALL THIS IS

00:55:06.936 --> 00:55:08.104
BEING ANALYZED ANALYSED BY

00:55:08.171 --> 00:55:10.273
QUALIFIED INSPECTORS AND ALSO

00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:12.442
WERE USING DIGITAL -- TECHNIQUES

00:55:12.509 --> 00:55:13.877
TO HELP US WE NEED MORE

00:55:13.943 --> 00:55:18.615
INFORMATION FROM WHAT WE'RE

00:55:18.682 --> 00:55:21.618
FINDING ON INSPECTIONS.

00:55:21.685 --> 00:55:23.119
ALSO IN THE VEGETATION SPACE IN

00:55:23.186 --> 00:55:23.920
OPERATION PRACTICES BOB I'M NOT

00:55:23.987 --> 00:55:24.554
GONNA SPEND A LOT OF TIME HERE

00:55:24.621 --> 00:55:25.455
THIS IS HISTORICALLY BEEN A

00:55:25.522 --> 00:55:26.356
PLACE OF GREAT EMPHASIS FOR US.

00:55:26.423 --> 00:55:28.925
BUT ALSO POINT OUT WE'RE MOVING

00:55:28.992 --> 00:55:30.260
FURTHER AWAY FROM OUR TRIMS OWNS

00:55:30.326 --> 00:55:31.561
WITH HISTORICALLY DONE DOUBLING

00:55:31.628 --> 00:55:33.329
THAT RANGE THIS WILL ADD MORE

00:55:33.396 --> 00:55:35.899
TREES INTO THAT -- INVENTORY ARE

00:55:35.965 --> 00:55:37.333
ALSO LOOKING AT SOMETHING WE

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:38.535
CALLED HAZARD TREES THESE ARE

00:55:38.601 --> 00:55:40.270
TREES OUTSIDE TYPICAL RIGHT AWAY

00:55:40.336 --> 00:55:41.037
HE'S.

00:55:41.104 --> 00:55:42.238
THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE

00:55:42.305 --> 00:55:43.840
ESCAPED I'LL CALL IT THE THE

00:55:43.907 --> 00:55:44.607
CHAINSAW.

00:55:44.674 --> 00:55:46.242
BUT WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE IS TREES

00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:48.244
THAT MAY ULTIMATELY CAUSE A

00:55:48.311 --> 00:55:50.113
PROBLEM BLOW INTO OUR SYSTEM

00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:51.781
FOLLOWING YOUR SYSTEM AND CAUSE

00:55:51.848 --> 00:55:52.148
A RISK FOR US.

00:55:52.215 --> 00:55:53.850
STORE MOVING BEYOND TRADITIONAL

00:55:53.917 --> 00:55:54.951
COMPLIANCE TRIMMING AND

00:55:55.018 --> 00:55:56.653
COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS EVEN MORE

00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:57.754
BROADLY TO THINGS THAT ARE

00:55:57.821 --> 00:55:59.522
OUTSIDE THE TRADITIONAL RIGHT

00:55:59.589 --> 00:56:01.024
AWAY IMPACTS SO THIS IS

00:56:01.091 --> 00:56:02.792
SOMETHING THAT WE FEELS CRITICAL

00:56:02.859 --> 00:56:08.131
AND IMPORTANT. TO REDUCING RISK

00:56:08.198 --> 00:56:08.732
AND AS PART OF OUR OPERATIONAL

00:56:08.798 --> 00:56:10.433
PROGRAM [inaudible]

00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:11.735
SO.

00:56:11.801 --> 00:56:12.469
MOVING NOW TO US SOMETHING I

00:56:12.535 --> 00:56:14.571
KNOW -- IT IS -- RIGHTLY GETTING

00:56:14.637 --> 00:56:16.239
A LOT OF ATTENTION AS PUBLIC

00:56:16.306 --> 00:56:18.708
SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF -- MANY OF

00:56:18.775 --> 00:56:20.009
HIS PROGRAMS WE HAVE IN PLACE OR

00:56:20.076 --> 00:56:22.178
PROGRAMS THAT WE ARE DOING IN

00:56:22.245 --> 00:56:23.613
THIS SPACE VERY SIMILAR SAN

00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:24.647
DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC.

00:56:24.714 --> 00:56:25.915
WE HAVE BENCHMARKED ACROSS

00:56:25.982 --> 00:56:27.984
UTILITIES INTO WHO'S DOING WHAT

00:56:28.051 --> 00:56:29.686
AND HOW WE CAN DO THIS BEST --

00:56:29.753 --> 00:56:30.854
BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:32.055
POINT OUT THAT THIS IS A KEY

00:56:32.122 --> 00:56:35.158
PART OF WHAT WE ARE VIEWING AS

00:56:35.225 --> 00:56:37.460
EXTREME EVENT -- ACTIONS THAT WE

00:56:37.527 --> 00:56:39.062
MAY NEED TO TAKE IN THE EVENT

00:56:39.129 --> 00:56:41.164
THAT THE WEATHER IS EXTREME AND

00:56:41.231 --> 00:56:42.665
WE ARE MAKING DECISIONS AROUND

00:56:42.732 --> 00:56:44.000
PUBLIC SAFETY.

00:56:44.067 --> 00:56:45.335
THE DECIDED THIS IS REALLY THE

00:56:45.401 --> 00:56:47.036
BEST BEST OPTION FOR PROTECTING

00:56:47.103 --> 00:56:48.505
OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR

00:56:48.571 --> 00:56:52.041
CUSTOMERS -- THIS HAS BEEN PART

00:56:52.108 --> 00:56:52.976
OF OUR I'LL CALL IT -- TOOL KIT

00:56:53.042 --> 00:56:54.310
FOR RISK MITIGATION FOR A COUPLE

00:56:54.377 --> 00:56:56.279
OF YEARS NOW WE ACTUALLY DID THE

00:56:56.346 --> 00:56:58.615
FIRST ONE OF THESE BELIEVES IN

00:56:58.681 --> 00:56:59.949
200-032-0004 -- BUT WE

00:57:00.016 --> 00:57:02.318
SIGNIFICANTLY UPGRADED POWER

00:57:02.385 --> 00:57:02.952
APPROACHING IT'S OUR LOOKING AT

00:57:03.019 --> 00:57:03.853
IT ONE OF THINGS IT'S VERY

00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:05.922
DIFFERENT FROM HOW WE'VE DONE

00:57:05.989 --> 00:57:07.524
THESE HISTORICALLY -- WE NOW

00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:08.825
LOOK AT EACH INDIVIDUAL CIRCUIT

00:57:08.892 --> 00:57:10.660
I MENTIONED DATA ANALYTICS SO

00:57:10.727 --> 00:57:12.028
WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE LOOKED

00:57:12.095 --> 00:57:13.263
AT OUR CIRCUITS BEHAVE IN HIGH

00:57:13.329 --> 00:57:14.364
WIND CONDITIONS.

00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:16.432
AND SO FOR EACH CIRCUIT WE HAVE

00:57:16.499 --> 00:57:19.035
A BUT UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT

00:57:19.102 --> 00:57:20.103
HAPPENED TO THAT CIRCUIT IN HIGH

00:57:20.170 --> 00:57:21.204
WIND CONDITIONS.

00:57:21.271 --> 00:57:22.639
THAT'S ONE OF THE DRIVERS WILL

00:57:22.705 --> 00:57:24.140
ENABLE US TO SAY WHEN WE SHOULD

00:57:24.207 --> 00:57:25.175
BE CONSIDERING.

00:57:25.241 --> 00:57:26.543
THE ENERGIZING CIRCUIT UNDER

00:57:26.609 --> 00:57:28.711
EXTREME CONDITIONS -- WE'VE GONE

00:57:28.778 --> 00:57:30.547
THROUGH A NUMBER OF UPGRADES TO

00:57:30.613 --> 00:57:31.915
OUR PROGRAM WE TO HAVE INVESTED

00:57:31.981 --> 00:57:33.650
IN A NEW -- SYSTEM FOR CUSTOMER

00:57:33.716 --> 00:57:35.552
NOTIFICATIONS THAT CAN PUT OUT --

00:57:35.618 --> 00:57:36.786
NORMS AMOUNTS OF NOTIFICATIONS

00:57:36.853 --> 00:57:38.655
IN A VERY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME

00:57:38.721 --> 00:57:40.490
TO GET THE WORD OUT VERY QUICKLY --

00:57:40.557 --> 00:57:41.658
WE'VE ENGAGED AND DOZENS OF

00:57:41.724 --> 00:57:42.826
COMMUNITY HEARINGS OF THE LAST

00:57:42.892 --> 00:57:44.127
COUPLE OF YEARS AND WILL

00:57:44.194 --> 00:57:45.728
CONTINUE TO DO THAT TO EDUCATE

00:57:45.795 --> 00:57:47.597
OUR COMMUNITIES ABOUT WHAT

00:57:47.664 --> 00:57:48.665
PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHOTS CAN

00:57:48.731 --> 00:57:51.067
MEAN TO THEM -- WE HAVE ENGAGED

00:57:51.134 --> 00:57:53.570
VERY VERY -- EARLY ON AND

00:57:53.636 --> 00:57:55.471
REGULARLY WHEN OUR FIRST

00:57:55.538 --> 00:57:56.806
RESPONDERS THERE ARE KEY INPUT

00:57:56.873 --> 00:57:58.341
BOS INFORMING THE PROGRAM AND

00:57:58.408 --> 00:57:59.976
ALSO DEVELOPING.

00:58:00.043 --> 00:58:01.845
RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE WILL NEED

00:58:01.911 --> 00:58:03.179
TO EXERCISE WHEN WE'RE ANY OF

00:58:03.246 --> 00:58:04.881
THAT THIS PROGRAM WILL RELY ON

00:58:04.948 --> 00:58:06.482
INFORMATION FROM OUR FIRST

00:58:06.549 --> 00:58:08.017
RESPONDERS ON THE GROUND DURING

00:58:08.084 --> 00:58:08.518
THE EVENT.

00:58:08.585 --> 00:58:10.587
IS NOT A DECISION THAT -- WE

00:58:10.653 --> 00:58:12.555
INTEND TO MAKE IT ISOLATION WE

00:58:12.622 --> 00:58:15.158
LOOK TO OUR ARE -- PARTNERS OF

00:58:15.225 --> 00:58:22.098
THE COMMISSION AND A CD AND

00:58:22.165 --> 00:58:22.632
OTHER AREAS IS AN ONGOING

00:58:22.699 --> 00:58:24.133
PROCEEDING THE HELP CONSTRUCT A

00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:25.401
FRAMEWORK AROUND THIS THAT WE

00:58:25.468 --> 00:58:26.069
CAN OPERATE WITHIN. TO MAKE THE

00:58:26.135 --> 00:58:27.036
VERY TOUGH CHOICES I THINK

00:58:27.103 --> 00:58:27.737
EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS AS

00:58:27.804 --> 00:58:28.972
UTILITIES WE EXIST TO SUPPLY

00:58:29.038 --> 00:58:29.672
POWER THAT'S OUR THAT'S OUR REAL

00:58:29.739 --> 00:58:31.074
REASON TO BE SUPPLY RELIABLE

00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:32.275
AFFORDABLE AND SAFE POWER TO OUR

00:58:32.342 --> 00:58:33.076
CUSTOMERS.

00:58:33.142 --> 00:58:34.510
AND SO DE ENERGIZING A CIRCUIT --

00:58:34.577 --> 00:58:36.012
IS NOT SOMETHING WE TAKE LIGHTLY

00:58:36.079 --> 00:58:36.913
AND THIS IS SOMETHING WE

00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:38.982
BUILDING UP PROGRAMS AND DATA

00:58:39.048 --> 00:58:40.450
INFORMATION AS WE CAN MAKE THE

00:58:40.516 --> 00:58:42.151
BEST POSSIBLE DECISION.

00:58:42.218 --> 00:58:44.354
IN A VERY VERY COMPRESSED TIME

00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:47.323
SITUATION [inaudible]

00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:50.360
SO. ONE WHO ARE NEAR CLOSE TO

00:58:50.426 --> 00:58:52.462
JUST HAVE A COUPLE MORE POINTS

00:58:52.528 --> 00:58:55.031
TO MAKE HERE BEFORE UP MOVING ON

00:58:55.098 --> 00:58:56.366
AT ITS CORE THIS IS ABOUT PEOPLE

00:58:56.432 --> 00:58:59.002
AND AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING.

00:58:59.068 --> 00:59:01.237
IS THE ORGANIZATION S. C. E.

BACK FILLING FOR WORK THAT HAS

00:59:17.921 --> 00:59:19.856
BEEN -- CREATED BY DIVERTING

00:59:19.923 --> 00:59:21.691
RESOURCES INTO THE WHILE FAR

00:59:21.758 --> 00:59:23.626
MITIGATION PLAN -- WE ARE

00:59:23.693 --> 00:59:25.428
LOOKING FOR THINK ABOUT THINGS

DIFFERENTLY WERE CHALLENGING OUR

00:59:26.763 --> 00:59:28.164
PLAYERS ARE TEAMS TO LOOK AT

00:59:28.231 --> 00:59:29.866
THINGS IN NEW AND DIFFERENT WAYS --

00:59:29.933 --> 00:59:31.801
WE'VE PARTNERED WITH OUR OUR

AND AND BY THE WAY THIS GETS ON

00:59:41.144 --> 00:59:42.712
WELL BEYOND JUST CREWS IN THE

00:59:42.779 --> 00:59:44.414
FIELD BUILDING AND INSPECTING

00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:45.915
THINGS THIS IS ALSO ENGINEERS

00:59:45.982 --> 00:59:47.116
AND PLANNERS.

00:59:47.183 --> 00:59:50.320
AND RISK -- RISK EXPERTS AND

00:59:50.386 --> 00:59:52.055
EXPERTISE ACROSS THE COMPLEX

SPACE [inaudible]

01:00:00.363 --> 01:00:02.598
SO.

01:00:02.665 --> 01:00:03.466
LOU MAYBE TO CLOSE WHICH IS A

01:00:03.533 --> 01:00:05.969
COUPLE POINTS HERE. ONE ARE WHAT

01:00:06.035 --> 01:00:07.470
FOR MITIGATION PLANS THIS IS --

01:00:07.537 --> 01:00:09.005
I WE HAVE A TIME LINE HERE --

01:00:09.072 --> 01:00:10.406
WE'VE FOCUSED MUCH EFFORT ON

01:00:10.473 --> 01:00:11.908
THINGS WE CAN DO IMMEDIATELY

01:00:11.975 --> 01:00:13.810
THIS GETS TO EFFECTIVENESS --

01:00:13.876 --> 01:00:14.277
THE ENHANCED OVERHEAD

01:00:14.344 --> 01:00:15.845
INSPECTIONS WE CAN DO THAT RIGHT

01:00:15.912 --> 01:00:17.513
AWAY WE'VE DONE THAT TO REDUCE

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:18.381
RISK.

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:19.515
OUR PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF

01:00:19.582 --> 01:00:21.751
PROGRAM WE HAVE REVISED OUR

01:00:21.818 --> 01:00:23.619
PROTOCOL AND HAVE DRILLED ARE

01:00:23.686 --> 01:00:24.487
TEAMS THAT ARE AYE ANTES ARE

01:00:24.554 --> 01:00:26.189
READY WHEN THE TIME IS COMING.

01:00:26.255 --> 01:00:27.457
TO DO THIS AND AN EVEN MORE

01:00:27.523 --> 01:00:28.591
INFORM WHY THOSE ARE THINGS WE

01:00:28.658 --> 01:00:30.560
DO RIGHT AWAY WE STARTED IN THE

01:00:30.626 --> 01:00:32.395
LONGER TERM THINGS COVER

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:33.830
CONDUCTOR SO TAKE US SEVERAL

01:00:33.896 --> 01:00:35.298
YEARS TO DEPLOY ENOUGH COVER

01:00:35.365 --> 01:00:36.265
CONDUCTOR.

01:00:36.332 --> 01:00:38.034
THAT WE THINK WILL MAKE A LARGE

01:00:38.101 --> 01:00:39.469
DIFFERENCE WE'LL SEE BENEFITS

01:00:39.535 --> 01:00:41.637
RIGHT AWAY WE HAVE A VERY LARGE

01:00:41.704 --> 01:00:42.238
SYSTEM IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:43.172
THAT IN MIND.

01:00:43.239 --> 01:00:44.340
SOME OF THE OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE

01:00:44.407 --> 01:00:45.942
INVESTMENTS THE FUSES WILL BE

01:00:46.009 --> 01:00:47.176
DONE WITH THAT SOON AND

01:00:47.243 --> 01:00:48.578
SITUATIONAL AWARENESS WE MOVED

01:00:48.644 --> 01:00:49.846
AGGRESSIVELY ON THAT SO WE'RE

01:00:49.912 --> 01:00:52.015
ESSENTIALLY COMPLETE WITH THAT

01:00:52.081 --> 01:00:54.550
BY -- TWENTY TWENTY WITH MOSTLY

01:00:54.617 --> 01:00:55.518
INVESTMENT WE WILL BE DOING.

01:00:55.585 --> 01:00:56.319
BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA STOP THERE I

01:00:56.386 --> 01:00:57.787
THINK ONE OF THINGS THAT WE ALSO

01:00:57.854 --> 01:01:00.023
WANT TO POINT OUT -- WHAT WE'RE

01:01:00.089 --> 01:01:01.491
SEEING IS THIS RISK IS EVOLVING?

01:01:01.557 --> 01:01:03.159
AND THE THREAT OF WILDFIRES IS

01:01:03.226 --> 01:01:04.727
DRIVEN BY CLIMATE CHANGE AND

01:01:04.794 --> 01:01:06.195
CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT STABILIZE

01:01:06.262 --> 01:01:07.096
BY ANY MEANS.

01:01:07.163 --> 01:01:08.498
WE'RE ALSO LEARNING MORE ABOUT

01:01:08.564 --> 01:01:10.466
DATA ANALYTICS AND TOOLS WE CAN

01:01:10.533 --> 01:01:11.901
BRING TO BEAR TERMS OF RISK

01:01:11.968 --> 01:01:12.802
MITIGATION.

01:01:12.869 --> 01:01:13.669
WE'RE GONNA CONTINUALLY

01:01:13.736 --> 01:01:15.438
INVOLVING CHALLENGE OURSELVES

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:16.472
WHICH WILL MEAN THIS PROGRAM

01:01:16.539 --> 01:01:18.107
WILL CONTINUE OF ALL OF OUR TIME

01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:19.442
THIS IS NOT A STATIC PROGRAM.

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:20.743
SO I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR

01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:21.978
THE TIME -- TO SPEAK WITH YOU

01:01:22.045 --> 01:01:23.846
ABOUT THIS TODAY LOOKING FOR

01:01:23.913 --> 01:01:25.815
ANSWERS SOME QUESTIONS I ALSO

01:01:25.882 --> 01:01:27.050
WANT TO SAY I BAG THANKS FOR THE

01:01:27.116 --> 01:01:27.984
PARTNERSHIP.

REGARDS TO THE SCALE OF THE ARE

01:03:03.746 --> 01:03:05.248
THE RISK IN THE ASSET BASE --

01:03:05.314 --> 01:03:07.550
THAT WERE REALLY DEALING WITH --

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:09.218
WITHIN OUR SERVICE TERRITORY --

01:03:09.285 --> 01:03:10.987
SO INCLUDED IN.

YOUR HANDOUT MATERIALS ON SLIDE --

01:03:13.689 --> 01:03:15.224
TO WE OUTLINE.

01:03:15.291 --> 01:03:17.160
THE OVERHEAD -- DISTRIBUTION AND

01:03:17.226 --> 01:03:18.961
TRANSMISSION MILES THAT WE HAVE

01:03:19.028 --> 01:03:21.264
THAT TRAVERSE EITHER ELEVATED --

01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:23.566
OR EXTREME WILDFIRE RISK.

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:26.269
WE'VE GOT A TOTAL OF ABOUT

01:03:26.335 --> 01:03:27.603
THIRTY THOUSAND MILES BETWEEN

01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:28.204
THE TRANSMISSION AND

01:03:28.271 --> 01:03:29.071
DISTRIBUTION.

01:03:29.138 --> 01:03:30.506
THAT TRAVERSE ELEVATED AND

01:03:30.573 --> 01:03:32.208
EXTREME QUALIFY RISK IT'S ABOUT

01:03:32.275 --> 01:03:35.578
A THIRD OF OUR OVER ALL ELECTRIC

01:03:35.645 --> 01:03:36.946
OVERHEAD SYSTEM.

01:03:37.013 --> 01:03:39.015
WHEN WE COMPARE THIS TO THE

01:03:39.081 --> 01:03:41.717
ENTIRE ASSET BASE WITHIN?

01:03:41.784 --> 01:03:43.719
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE

01:03:43.786 --> 01:03:46.355
NEARLY 65% OF OUR DISTRIBUTION

01:03:46.422 --> 01:03:47.623
OVER HEADLINES IN THE STATE OF

01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:49.058
CALIFORNIA IN OUR SERVICE

01:03:49.125 --> 01:03:49.859
TERRITORY.

01:03:49.926 --> 01:03:51.894
THAT ARE PART OF ELEVATED IN

01:03:51.961 --> 01:03:53.529
EXTREME WILDFIRE RISK.

01:03:53.596 --> 01:03:59.669
AND FIX SPEND UPON THIS FURTHER --

01:03:59.735 --> 01:04:00.970
AND LOOK AT THE NEXT PAGE.

01:04:01.037 --> 01:04:01.537
IT REALLY PROVIDES.

01:04:01.604 --> 01:04:03.372
INSIGHTS IN REGARDS -- TO THE

01:04:03.439 --> 01:04:04.106
THE LAND BASE THAT'S BEEN

01:04:04.173 --> 01:04:05.675
CHARACTERIZED AS ELEVATED AND

01:04:05.741 --> 01:04:06.475
EXTREME OFF OUR RISK WE'VE GOT A

01:04:06.542 --> 01:04:08.744
SERVICE TERRITORY OF SEVENTY TWO

01:04:08.811 --> 01:04:10.179
THOUSAND SQUARE MILES MORE THAN

01:04:10.246 --> 01:04:11.747
HALF OF THAT.

01:04:11.814 --> 01:04:13.916
IS DESIGNATED WITHIN THOSE TWO

01:04:13.983 --> 01:04:15.184
CLASSIFICATIONS.

01:04:15.251 --> 01:04:17.053
THAT AMOUNTS TO ABOUT THIRTY

01:04:17.119 --> 01:04:18.254
EIGHT THOUSAND SQUARE MILES OR

01:04:18.321 --> 01:04:21.457
ROUGHLY 70% OF ALL OF THE HIGH

01:04:21.524 --> 01:04:22.058
FOR AREAS WITHIN THE STATE OF

01:04:22.124 --> 01:04:23.125
CALIFORNIA.

01:04:23.192 --> 01:04:24.160
AND ONE OF THE KEY ELEMENTS SUCH

01:04:24.227 --> 01:04:26.529
DRIVING THAT IS THE AMOUNT OF

01:04:26.596 --> 01:04:28.864
DENSE VEGETATION -- THAT.

01:04:28.931 --> 01:04:29.932
EXISTS WITHIN OUR SERVICE

01:04:29.999 --> 01:04:31.667
TERRITORY -- ESPECIALLY IN THE

01:04:31.734 --> 01:04:33.069
NORTHERN PART OF OUR SERVICE

01:04:33.135 --> 01:04:35.504
TERRITORY IN THE SIERRA AND THE

01:04:35.571 --> 01:04:38.674
NORTH VALLEY -- PARTS -- OF OF

01:04:38.741 --> 01:04:40.443
OUR TERRITORY.

01:04:40.509 --> 01:04:41.978
SO GIVEN THAT ASSET BASED ON THE

01:04:42.044 --> 01:04:43.579
SCALE WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT

01:04:43.646 --> 01:04:45.081
IT FROM A LOT OF FIRE SAFETY

01:04:45.147 --> 01:04:46.182
PROGRAM.

01:04:46.249 --> 01:04:48.517
AND THE APPROACH THAT WE'VE

01:04:48.584 --> 01:04:49.885
TAKEN IS FROM A TIME BASED

01:04:49.952 --> 01:04:51.988
PERSPECTIVE REALLY FOCUSED ON

01:04:52.054 --> 01:04:53.489
THE NEAR TERM WHICH ARE THE

01:04:53.556 --> 01:04:55.024
INITIATIVE HERE AND NOW THE MID

01:04:55.091 --> 01:04:56.959
TERM AND THE LONG TERM SO THAT

01:04:57.026 --> 01:04:58.094
WERE CONCURRENTLY.

01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:00.229
IMPLEMENTING ACROSS A MULTI

01:05:00.296 --> 01:05:02.798
PRONGED APPROACH -- TO NAVIGATE

01:05:02.865 --> 01:05:04.033
THE CHALLENGES.

01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:06.068
REALLY THE THREE PRIMARY AREAS

01:05:06.135 --> 01:05:07.770
AND PILLARS.

01:05:07.837 --> 01:05:09.939
THAT ALIGN OUR THE REAL TIME

01:05:10.006 --> 01:05:11.107
MONITORING AND INTELLIGENCE

01:05:11.173 --> 01:05:13.309
CAPABILITIES THE NEW AND

01:05:13.376 --> 01:05:14.076
ENHANCED SAFETY MEASURES THAT

01:05:14.143 --> 01:05:14.944
WE'VE.

01:05:15.011 --> 01:05:16.345
PUT FORWARD AND A CRITICAL

01:05:16.412 --> 01:05:19.615
HARDENING OF OUR ELECTRIC SYSTEM.

01:05:19.682 --> 01:05:20.950
I WANT TO TOUCH ON EACH OF THESE

01:05:21.017 --> 01:05:22.418
IN A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL --

01:05:22.485 --> 01:05:24.020
IN REGARDS TO THE REAL TIME

01:05:24.086 --> 01:05:24.787
MONITORING INTELLIGENCE

01:05:24.854 --> 01:05:26.956
CAPABILITIES IS VERY SIMILAR TO

01:05:27.023 --> 01:05:27.456
WHAT YOU HEARD FROM MY

01:05:27.523 --> 01:05:29.992
COLLEAGUES IN REGARDS TO THE

01:05:30.059 --> 01:05:31.360
SITUATION AWARENESS CAPABILITIES --

01:05:31.427 --> 01:05:34.463
WE ARE DEPLOYING -- A A WEATHER

CLIMATOLOGY SELECT.

01:05:41.070 --> 01:05:42.538
THAT CAN REALLY HELP INFORM.

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:43.973
THE LOCAL WEATHER -- AND THE

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.941
IMPLICATIONS TO OUR ASSETS SO WE

01:05:46.008 --> 01:05:48.444
CAN USE THAT TO INFORM ANALYTICS

01:05:48.511 --> 01:05:50.246
TO UNDERSTAND WHERE WE HAVE.

01:05:50.313 --> 01:05:53.015
THE GREATEST LEVEL OF RISK ON A

01:05:53.082 --> 01:05:55.318
CIRCUIT BY CIRCUIT BASIS AND

01:05:55.384 --> 01:05:57.853
WELL PROCEED WITH THE THE RISK

MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.

01:09:38.874 --> 01:09:42.077
WE'VE -- THIS YEAR DOUBLED.

01:09:42.144 --> 01:09:43.612
THE SIZE OF OUR PROGRAM --

01:09:43.679 --> 01:09:46.882
COMING INTO THIS YEAR -- THE

VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

01:09:48.317 --> 01:09:50.219
WAS UP ROUGHLY A THREE HUNDRED

01:09:50.286 --> 01:09:51.954
BILLION DOLLARS WE'VE ACTUALLY

01:09:52.021 --> 01:09:53.956
MORE THAN DOUBLE THAT -- WE NOT

01:09:54.023 --> 01:09:57.026
ONLY HAVE A FOCUS ON MAINTAINING

01:09:57.092 --> 01:09:59.528
THE MINIMUM REQUIRED CLEARANCES

01:09:59.595 --> 01:10:02.131
AS PRESCRIBED IN THE RESPECTIVE

ADDITION TO FOCUSING ON THE DEAD

01:10:06.201 --> 01:10:07.970
DYING AND DISEASED TREES AS PART

01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:09.338
OF A TREE MORTALITY PROGRAM

01:10:09.405 --> 01:10:11.240
WE'VE ON RAMP TO RISK BASED

01:10:11.307 --> 01:10:12.441

VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

01:10:14.076 --> 01:10:15.511
AND THAT'S REALLY FOCUSED ON

01:10:15.578 --> 01:10:17.780
REMOVING ALL OF THE OVERHANG --

01:10:17.846 --> 01:10:20.683
THAT MAYBE HANGING ON TOP OF OUR

01:10:20.749 --> 01:10:23.919
OF BARE WIRES EVEN THOUGH --

01:10:23.986 --> 01:10:25.554
THERE'S ADEQUATE CLEARANCE -- AS

01:10:25.621 --> 01:10:28.123
PRESCRIBED IN THE THE COMPLIANCE

01:10:28.190 --> 01:10:29.692
REGULATIONS.

01:10:29.758 --> 01:10:32.494
WE HAVE ALSO MOVED FORWARD WITH --

01:10:32.561 --> 01:10:33.929
IDENTIFYING AND CHARACTERIZING

01:10:33.996 --> 01:10:36.031
HAZARDOUS TREES AS WE LOOKED AT

01:10:36.098 --> 01:10:38.701
THE NUMBER AND THE DRIVER OF

01:10:38.767 --> 01:10:40.169
VEGETATION BECAUSE TECHNICIANS

01:10:40.235 --> 01:10:41.637
WE IDENTIFIED THAT THERE IS A

01:10:41.704 --> 01:10:43.572
STRONG CORRELATION. FOR CERTAIN

01:10:43.639 --> 01:10:45.975
TYPE OF TREES THAT HAVE A HIGHER

01:10:46.041 --> 01:10:47.676
PROPENSITY OF FALLING IN OR

01:10:47.743 --> 01:10:49.278
BLOWING INTO OUR LINES THAT MAY

01:10:49.345 --> 01:10:51.046
BE TALL ENOUGH YET NOT FAR

01:10:51.113 --> 01:10:52.548
ENOUGH FROM OUR LINES.

01:10:52.615 --> 01:10:54.550
ON SEWER PROACTIVELY IDENTIFYING

01:10:54.617 --> 01:10:57.453
THOSE TYPES OF TREE SPECIES --

01:10:57.519 --> 01:10:58.988
AND IF THEY HAVE A CERTAIN DE

01:10:59.054 --> 01:11:00.255
FACT EVEN IF THEY'RE ALIVE AND

01:11:00.322 --> 01:11:02.358
HEALTHY MOVING FORWARD WITHOUT

01:11:02.424 --> 01:11:03.826
REMOVING THAT RISK.

01:11:03.892 --> 01:11:05.828
FROM OUR SYSTEM AND ONE OF THE

01:11:05.894 --> 01:11:08.297
REASONS FOR THE FOCUS AROUND OUR

01:11:08.364 --> 01:11:09.665
AND HAS VISITATION MANAGEMENT

01:11:09.732 --> 01:11:12.167
AND THE INSPECTIONS IS WHEN WE

01:11:12.234 --> 01:11:14.570
ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE DRIVERS FOR

01:11:14.637 --> 01:11:16.271
THE FIRE IGNITIONS WITHIN P.

01:11:16.338 --> 01:11:17.206
GINNY SYSTEM.

WITH OUR OVERHEAD SYSTEMS MAKE

01:11:21.844 --> 01:11:23.178
UP ABOUT 50%.

01:11:23.245 --> 01:11:25.881
OF THE IGNITION DRIVERS AND

01:11:25.948 --> 01:11:27.116
EQUIPMENT.

01:11:27.182 --> 01:11:30.185
RELATED ISSUES IS ANOTHER 25% --

01:11:30.252 --> 01:11:32.221
AND THE BALANCE OF THE 25% IS

01:11:32.287 --> 01:11:33.856
PROBABLY AROUND THIRD PARTY --

01:11:33.922 --> 01:11:35.624
ANIMAL CONTACT OR A ABOVE A

OUR ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM --

01:11:52.675 --> 01:11:53.575
AND THAT'S REALLY PART OF OUR

01:11:53.642 --> 01:11:54.209
LONGER TERM SYSTEM HARDENING AND

01:11:54.276 --> 01:11:55.644
PRESIDENCY STRATEGY WE'RE NOT

01:11:55.711 --> 01:11:56.812
WAITING WE'VE -- ALREADY MOVED

01:11:56.879 --> 01:11:58.480
TO ACTION ON THAT WE'VE GOT

01:11:58.547 --> 01:12:00.049
ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE MILES

01:12:00.115 --> 01:12:01.183
COMPLETED BETWEEN.

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:04.186
THE LAST QUARTER OF LAST YEAR AS

01:12:04.253 --> 01:12:04.820
WELL AS THE WORK WE'VE DONE TO

01:12:04.887 --> 01:12:05.721
THIS YEAR.

01:12:05.788 --> 01:12:06.889
AND WE LOOK TO GET.

01:12:06.955 --> 01:12:07.723
A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES

01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:09.358
COMPLETED BY THE END OF THE YEAR

01:12:09.425 --> 01:12:11.126
AND START TO MOVE TO ABOUT SIX

HUNDRED MILES.

01:12:12.561 --> 01:12:14.196
PER YEAR BEGINNING NEXT YEAR AND

01:12:14.263 --> 01:12:15.297
SOME OF THE EXAMPLES ON A

01:12:15.364 --> 01:12:17.633
FUNDAMENTAL REDESIGN IS WERE --

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:19.735
EVALUATING -- OTHER

01:12:19.802 --> 01:12:20.969
OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO

01:12:21.036 --> 01:12:24.239
ELIMINATE THE RISK -- BY

01:12:24.306 --> 01:12:25.874
REMOVING THE OVERHEAD ELECTRICAL

01:12:25.941 --> 01:12:27.910
LINES IN SOME CASES WE'VE GOT A

01:12:27.976 --> 01:12:29.445
FIVE AND A HALF TO SIX MILE LINE

01:12:29.511 --> 01:12:30.879
THAT'S TRAVERSING.

01:12:30.946 --> 01:12:33.415
A HEAVY DANCE AND FOREST AREA

01:12:33.482 --> 01:12:35.017
THIS PROVIDING SERVICE TO

01:12:35.084 --> 01:12:36.919
RAILWAY SIGNAL -- THERE'S A

01:12:36.985 --> 01:12:38.687
BETTER WAY TO PROVIDE SERVICE --

01:12:38.754 --> 01:12:40.589
TO THAT -- RESPECTIVE ENTITY AN

BATTERY BACK UP AS AN EXAMPLE SO.

01:12:44.426 --> 01:12:45.694
HOSPITAL OF THE NATION IS ONE

01:12:45.761 --> 01:12:47.229
PART OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING OUT

01:12:47.296 --> 01:12:48.130
FOR SYSTEM HARDENING.

01:12:48.197 --> 01:12:49.331
ANOTHER DIMENSION ABOUT SYSTEM

01:12:49.398 --> 01:12:51.333
HARDING IS -- LOOKING AT

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:52.434
TARGETED UNDER GROUNDING.

01:12:52.501 --> 01:12:53.635
SPECIFICALLY AROUND A

01:12:53.702 --> 01:12:59.775
COMMUNITIES THAT MAY HAVE.

01:12:59.842 --> 01:13:00.943
SIGNIFICANT ADDRESS CHALLENGES

01:13:01.009 --> 01:13:03.645
AND WE'RE WE HAVE OUR POLL LINES --

01:13:03.712 --> 01:13:04.279
THAT TRAVERSE.

01:13:04.346 --> 01:13:05.247
ON OVERHEAD BASIS ALONG THOSE

01:13:05.314 --> 01:13:06.448
EGRESS ACCESS IS THOSE ARE

01:13:06.515 --> 01:13:07.282
OPPORTUNITIES FOR US.

PART OF SYSTEM HARDENING -- AND

01:13:10.719 --> 01:13:12.221
THEN THE LAST IN A KINDA ELEMENT

01:13:12.287 --> 01:13:13.689
AROUND SYSTEM PARTING IS VERY

01:13:13.756 --> 01:13:16.191
SIMILAR AROUND -- IMPLEMENTING

COMPOSITE BASED POLLS.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:25.567
THE LAST ITEM I'D LIKE TO TOUCH

01:13:25.634 --> 01:13:27.169
ON IS THE PRODUCT OF THE

GOING FORWARD IN TERMS OF THE

01:14:45.914 --> 01:14:47.449
GREAT BAY SOLUTION.

01:14:47.516 --> 01:14:48.083
THE OTHER THING WE'RE DOING IS

01:14:48.150 --> 01:14:50.886
WE ARE FURTHER SEGMENTING OUR

01:14:50.953 --> 01:14:53.021
DISTRIBUTION -- CIRCUIT SO THAT

01:14:53.088 --> 01:14:54.656
WE CAN BE MUCH MORE TARGETED --

01:14:54.723 --> 01:14:55.958
INSTALLING THE WEATHER STATIONS

01:14:56.024 --> 01:14:57.693
AT THE GRANULAR LEVEL WHEN WE DO

01:14:57.759 --> 01:14:59.094
DE ENERGIZED SO WE'RE NOT

01:14:59.161 --> 01:15:00.929
IMPACTING A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER

01:15:00.996 --> 01:15:01.964
OF CUSTOMERS.

01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:03.732
AS A RESULT OF A DEACTIVATION OF

01:15:03.799 --> 01:15:04.533
ACT.

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:05.801
THE SECOND PART OF THE STRATEGY

01:15:05.868 --> 01:15:06.869
IS REALLY A COMMUNITY BASED

01:15:06.935 --> 01:15:08.604
SOLUTION -- SO WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:15:08.670 --> 01:15:10.138
COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS WE

01:15:10.205 --> 01:15:11.573
HAVE MORE THAN FIFTY LOCATIONS

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:12.507
IDENTIFIED.

01:15:12.574 --> 01:15:14.476
NOT ACROSS THE TWENTY SEVEN

01:15:14.543 --> 01:15:16.078
DIFFERENT COUNTIES -- AND WE'RE

01:15:16.144 --> 01:15:16.712
GOING TO CONTINUE TO WRAP THAT

01:15:16.778 --> 01:15:18.580
UP AND ENGAGE WITH A LOCAL

01:15:18.647 --> 01:15:20.315
OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES TO

01:15:20.382 --> 01:15:21.383
MOVE.

01:15:21.450 --> 01:15:22.751
TO MORE OF A PERMANENT TYPE OF A

01:15:22.818 --> 01:15:24.519
FACILITY IN COORDINATION IN

01:15:24.586 --> 01:15:26.488
PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM -- FROM A

01:15:26.555 --> 01:15:28.457
A BACKUP GENERATION PERSPECTIVE

01:15:28.523 --> 01:15:34.596
FOR THE COMMUNITY -- CAN

01:15:34.663 --> 01:15:35.697
AGGREGATE WE CAN PROVIDE CHARGE

01:15:35.764 --> 01:15:37.232
SERVICES BASIC NEEDS A NECESSITY

01:15:37.299 --> 01:15:38.000
CENTERS WATER SERVICES AND

01:15:38.066 --> 01:15:39.067
INFORMATION IN REGARDS TO THE

01:15:39.134 --> 01:15:39.401
EVENT ITSELF.

01:15:39.468 --> 01:15:40.435
AND THEN THE THE LAST ITEM THAT

01:15:40.502 --> 01:15:41.103
WE'RE BASICALLY FOCUSED ON A IS

01:15:41.169 --> 01:15:42.271
REALLY A CUSTOMER BASE SOLUTION

01:15:42.337 --> 01:15:44.006
AND WE'RE REALLY ENABLING -- THE

01:15:44.072 --> 01:15:45.507
GENERATION MARKETS WERE MAKING

01:15:45.574 --> 01:15:47.209
IT EASIER FOR OUR RESIDENTIAL

01:15:47.276 --> 01:15:49.811
CUSTOMERS -- TO INTERFACE WITH

01:15:49.878 --> 01:15:51.313
THE VENDORS THAT PROVIDE TURNKEY

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:52.948
SERVICES FOR BACKUP GENERATION

01:15:53.015 --> 01:15:54.082
SO THEY CAN HAVE.

01:15:54.149 --> 01:15:56.585
APPROPRIATE ACCESS TO ENTITIES

01:15:56.652 --> 01:15:58.020
LIKE HOME DEPOT AND AND AND

01:15:58.086 --> 01:15:59.621
OTHERS THAT BASICALLY INSTALLED --

01:15:59.688 --> 01:16:01.523
THE GENERATORS AND ALSO PROVIDE

01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:03.325
THE GENERATORS THEMSELVES NOT

01:16:03.392 --> 01:16:05.827
MORE SPECIFICALLY IN REGARDS --

01:16:05.894 --> 01:16:07.029
TO BE AT THE RESIDENTIAL

01:16:07.095 --> 01:16:08.931
CUSTOMERS AND THE THE MEDICAL

01:16:08.997 --> 01:16:10.599
BAY FIND CUSTOMERS.

01:16:10.666 --> 01:16:12.000
WE ARE REALLY.

01:16:12.067 --> 01:16:13.902
LOOKING AT AND AND CURRENTLY

01:16:13.969 --> 01:16:15.070
PARTNERING UP WITH A COMMUNITY

01:16:15.137 --> 01:16:16.772
BASED ORGANIZATION KNOWN AS THE

01:16:16.838 --> 01:16:18.140
CALIFORNIA FOUNDATION OF

INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS --

01:16:19.942 --> 01:16:21.910
AND LOOKING TO ESTABLISH A GRANT

01:16:21.977 --> 01:16:23.378
BASED PROGRAM WHERE WE CAN

01:16:23.445 --> 01:16:26.448
ALLOCATE FUNDING. TO MAKE THE

01:16:26.515 --> 01:16:28.250
BACKUP GENERATION -- MORE COST

01:16:28.317 --> 01:16:29.985
COMPETITIVE A MORE AFFORDABLE

01:16:30.052 --> 01:16:33.622
AND ACCESSIBLE. FOR THOSE

01:16:33.689 --> 01:16:35.857

NEARLY THREE THOUSAND WORKERS --

MANY OF THESE APPROACHES I I

01:17:57.439 --> 01:17:58.974
HAVE TWO QUESTIONS I'D LIKE TO

01:17:59.041 --> 01:18:03.245
RAISE -- JUST TO GET US STARTED --

01:18:03.311 --> 01:18:05.480
MR HERRINGTON -- THERE ARE

01:18:05.547 --> 01:18:08.083
REPRESENT THE AREA ABOUT TO DO

01:18:08.150 --> 01:18:08.650
YOU KNOW WHICH IS A FOOT --

01:18:08.717 --> 01:18:08.950

THE BASE OF ANGELES FOREST AND

01:18:11.019 --> 01:18:12.921
YOU TALK ABOUT THEY HAVE HAD AND

01:18:12.988 --> 01:18:14.256
WE HAD A COMMUNITY HEARING.

01:18:14.322 --> 01:18:16.725
OF SOME CONCERN ABOUT SORT OF

01:18:16.792 --> 01:18:21.129
THE THE CRESTS OF THREE TRIMMING

01:18:21.196 --> 01:18:26.735
THAT'S TAKING PLACE IN THAT AREA.

01:18:26.802 --> 01:18:28.036
AND I GUESS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS

01:18:28.103 --> 01:18:30.872
I HAVE IS WHAT EFFORT IS --

01:18:30.939 --> 01:18:31.740
EDISON TAKING TO SERVE DO A

01:18:31.807 --> 01:18:32.808
BETTER JOB OF INTEGRATING WITH

01:18:32.874 --> 01:18:33.875
THE COMMUNITY LETTING THEM KNOW

01:18:33.942 --> 01:18:35.444
WHAT YOUR PLANS ARE.

01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:36.912
BECAUSE YOU KNOW.

01:18:39.581 --> 01:18:44.219
ALTADENA -- I HAVE ARBORS.

01:18:44.286 --> 01:18:44.820
ISRAEL ARBORIST THAT LIVE IN

01:18:44.886 --> 01:18:47.122
THAT AREA AND THEY WERE THE

01:18:47.189 --> 01:18:48.723

CUTTING OF THE TREES -- BECAUSE

01:18:54.262 --> 01:18:55.697
GREAT ALARM TO THEM SO.

01:18:55.764 --> 01:18:57.833
HOW DO WE START TO WORK TOGETHER

01:18:57.899 --> 01:18:59.167
WITH THE COMMUNITY AS YOU'D?

01:18:59.234 --> 01:19:00.702
MAYBE RIGHTFULLY LOOK AT

01:19:00.769 --> 01:19:02.270
EXPANDING YOUR OF YOUR TRIMMING

01:19:02.337 --> 01:19:03.972
AREA SO THAT THERE'S A BETTER

01:19:04.039 --> 01:19:06.108
UNDERSTANDING OF THE REASONS WHY

01:19:06.174 --> 01:19:09.744
AND THE METHOD THAT YOU'RE USING --

01:19:09.811 --> 01:19:11.246
TO TRIM BACK THE TREES SURE BOB

01:19:11.313 --> 01:19:12.247
THANK YOU JERROLD AYE THAT WAS A

01:19:12.314 --> 01:19:13.982
THAT HEARING AS WELL SO I KEENLY

ARE BELOVED THERE AND WE

01:19:20.789 --> 01:19:22.524
UNDERSTAND THAT SO.

01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:23.758
I I BUT YOU'VE HIGHLIGHTED A KEY

01:19:23.825 --> 01:19:25.861
POINT FOR US I THINK ONE OF THE

01:19:25.927 --> 01:19:29.164
THINGS THAT WE HAVE FOCUSED ON A

01:19:29.231 --> 01:19:31.299
SINCE AND EVEN BEFORE THAT I

01:19:31.366 --> 01:19:31.900
THINK PART OF THIS IS GETTING

01:19:31.967 --> 01:19:32.701
THE WORD OUT.

01:19:32.767 --> 01:19:34.836
OF MORE COMMUNITY HEARINGS AND

01:19:34.903 --> 01:19:36.505
MORE COMMUNITY OUT REACH TO

01:19:36.571 --> 01:19:38.006
EDUCATE THE COMMUNITY IN THE WHY

01:19:38.073 --> 01:19:40.375
AND THE THE WHAT WE'RE DOING --

01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:41.610
WE'VE ALSO REFINED I'LL CALL IT

01:19:41.676 --> 01:19:43.311
OUR ESCALATION PROCESS OUR

01:19:43.378 --> 01:19:45.914
PROCESS FOR NOTIFICATION AND AND

01:19:45.981 --> 01:19:49.117
pAND AND DISCUSSION AS WE MOVE

01:19:49.184 --> 01:19:51.353
FORWARD WITH -- WITH ANY KIND OF

01:19:51.419 --> 01:19:53.221
TRIM ACTIVITY -- A COUPLE OF

01:19:53.288 --> 01:19:54.723
POINTS I DO WANT TO SAY THAT THE

01:19:54.789 --> 01:19:56.057
THE THE THE FOLKS FROM OUR TEAM

01:19:56.124 --> 01:19:57.492
WHO DO THE LISTING AND

01:19:57.559 --> 01:19:59.327
IDENTIFICATION OR ALSO QUALIFIED

01:19:59.394 --> 01:20:01.663
ARBORIST SO -- THEY EVEN THOUGH

01:20:01.730 --> 01:20:03.231
THEIR JOB IS TO TRIM TREES --

01:20:03.298 --> 01:20:04.866
THEY THEY HAVE A PASSION FOR

01:20:04.933 --> 01:20:06.868
TREES AS WELL -- BUT WE

01:20:06.935 --> 01:20:07.502
UNDERSTAND THIS IS A SENSITIVE

01:20:07.569 --> 01:20:09.471
ISSUE AND IT'S PART OF THE

01:20:09.538 --> 01:20:11.239
BALANCE THAT WE ARE ARE TRYING

01:20:11.306 --> 01:20:13.308
TO COME TO AS WE LOOK -- TO

01:20:13.375 --> 01:20:16.478
WORKING WITH OUR COMMUNITIES --

01:20:16.545 --> 01:20:17.112
TO TO TO HAVE THEM BRING THEM

01:20:17.179 --> 01:20:18.813
ALONG AND FRANKLY THIS -- THIS

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:20.215
PROCESS WE'RE MOVING FORWARD

01:20:20.282 --> 01:20:22.083
WITH TO REDUCE RISK BUT MORE

01:20:22.150 --> 01:20:23.185
COMMUNITY OUTREACH WE'VE

01:20:23.251 --> 01:20:24.553
UPGRADED OUR NOTIFICATION

01:20:24.619 --> 01:20:26.354
PROCESS IS AND WILL CONTINUE TO

01:20:26.421 --> 01:20:27.923
WORK WITH OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:20:27.989 --> 01:20:30.192
AND SOLICIT FEEDBACK SO WE CAN

01:20:30.258 --> 01:20:31.459
EDUCATE THEM I I THINK PART OF

01:20:31.526 --> 01:20:34.696
THIS -- IS IS THE FACT THAT WE

01:20:34.763 --> 01:20:36.531
ARE DOING THINGS DIFFERENTLY AND

01:20:36.598 --> 01:20:38.200
MORE EXTENSIVELY AND AND

01:20:38.266 --> 01:20:39.467
CANDIDLY MORE AGGRESSIVELY

01:20:39.534 --> 01:20:40.669
BECAUSE OF THE RISK.

01:20:40.735 --> 01:20:42.671
I THINK THE SHARP EDGE OF THAT

01:20:42.737 --> 01:20:44.806
IS THAT -- SOME FOLKS HAVEN'T

01:20:44.873 --> 01:20:46.141
SEEN THAT BEFORE AND MAY NOT

01:20:46.208 --> 01:20:47.809
UNDERSTAND THE RATIONALE FOR

01:20:47.876 --> 01:20:54.316
DOING THAT AND THAT'S WERE

01:20:54.382 --> 01:20:56.918
FOCUSING OUR EFFORTS.

01:20:56.985 --> 01:20:57.552
I THINK THAT'S FAIR -- BUT I AND

01:20:57.619 --> 01:20:59.387
I I LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE TO WORK

01:20:59.454 --> 01:21:00.188
WITH YOU BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW

01:21:00.255 --> 01:21:01.189
THAT THAT IS TO IN A A MAJOR

01:21:01.256 --> 01:21:01.890
ISSUE IN THE AREA AND I'M

01:21:01.957 --> 01:21:03.525
ASSUMING THAT OTHER COMMUNITIES --

01:21:03.592 --> 01:21:05.527
BORDER FOR HILL -- OR FORCED

01:21:05.594 --> 01:21:06.461
ERRORS THE INTERFACE ARE

01:21:06.528 --> 01:21:07.195
PROBABLY GOING TO HEAR SIMILAR

01:21:07.262 --> 01:21:08.396
CONCERNS FROM.

01:21:08.463 --> 01:21:10.732
OF THE OTHER -- TERRITORY

01:21:10.799 --> 01:21:12.334
REPRESENTATIVES ON THE

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:14.469
DISCUSSION KIND OF THIS FOR ALL

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:16.104
OF YOU TO TO SORT OF THINK ABOUT

01:21:16.171 --> 01:21:18.373
ERICA RESPOND -- TO AND THIS IS

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:20.141
REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND --

01:21:20.208 --> 01:21:22.244
ON THE ENERGY IS A SEND WHAT

01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:23.545
YOUR BACKUP.

01:21:23.612 --> 01:21:25.914
STRATEGIES ARE AS IT RELATES TO

01:21:25.981 --> 01:21:28.049
POWER AND HOW YOU WOULD PROVIDE

01:21:28.116 --> 01:21:28.683
THAT I KNOW STORAGE IS ONE OF

01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:31.286
THE OPTIONS BUT CLEARLY YOU CAN

01:21:31.353 --> 01:21:33.054
HAVE STORAGE IN EVERY.

01:21:33.121 --> 01:21:35.457
GARAGE -- AND THEN OF COURSE AS

01:21:35.523 --> 01:21:37.459
YOU LOOK AT MICHAEL GRADES

01:21:37.525 --> 01:21:39.561
MICHAEL GRADES ARE CERTAINLY.

01:21:39.628 --> 01:21:41.796
A APPROACH THAT -- HAS SOME

01:21:41.863 --> 01:21:44.733
VIABILITY BUT UNLESS YOU'RE

01:21:44.799 --> 01:21:46.101
UNDERGROUND IN THE LINES.

01:21:46.167 --> 01:21:47.969
THEY WOULD BE IMPACTED BY THE

01:21:48.036 --> 01:21:49.137
ENERGIZING AS WELL.

01:21:49.204 --> 01:21:50.572
AND THEN OF COURSE THE ULTIMATE

01:21:50.639 --> 01:21:52.140
COST TO THE RATE PAYERS.

01:21:52.207 --> 01:21:54.075
HOW DO YOU KIND OF CLARIFY THESE

01:21:54.142 --> 01:21:55.677
ISSUES AND AND HOW YOU'RE

01:21:55.744 --> 01:21:58.346
LOOKING AT MOVING FO TO PROVIDE

01:21:58.413 --> 01:22:01.683
A -- A STRATEGY.

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:03.652
FOR BACK UP WHERE APPROPRIATE --

01:22:03.718 --> 01:22:05.320
WHEN YOU DE ENERGIZED IN CERTAIN

01:22:05.387 --> 01:22:06.855
AREAS?

01:22:06.921 --> 01:22:08.189
MAYBE I CAN -- BILL OFFER

01:22:08.256 --> 01:22:09.257
COUPLE THINGS IN MY COLLEAGUES

01:22:09.324 --> 01:22:11.259
HERE HAVE VIEWS -- AND AND WE

01:22:11.326 --> 01:22:12.661
WITH A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME OR

01:22:12.727 --> 01:22:14.062
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT -- AND

01:22:14.129 --> 01:22:16.264
IS IT IS WORKING ON THAT -- WE

01:22:16.331 --> 01:22:17.232
DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO SHARE YET

01:22:17.299 --> 01:22:18.400
SO.

01:22:18.466 --> 01:22:20.502
I I IT IT PARALLELS MANY OF THE

01:22:20.568 --> 01:22:24.005
RESPONSES AND AND AND PLANS AND

01:22:24.072 --> 01:22:24.639
AND PROTOCOLS WERE PUTTING INTO

01:22:24.706 --> 01:22:25.674
PLACE.

01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:26.841
FIRST AND FOREMOST CAM THIS IS A

01:22:26.908 --> 01:22:28.043
THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE WHICH IS

01:22:28.109 --> 01:22:30.011
WHY WE'RE EVEN HAVING A

01:22:30.078 --> 01:22:32.280
CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW SO -- THE

01:22:32.347 --> 01:22:34.149
THE DECISION TO DO IS NOT MADE

01:22:34.215 --> 01:22:35.550
LIGHTLY SO PART OF IT I CAN ONLY

01:22:35.617 --> 01:22:37.819
STARTS WITH HOW DO WE FIND WAYS

01:22:37.886 --> 01:22:40.255
TO REDUCE THE OVERALL FOOTPRINT.

01:22:40.322 --> 01:22:41.990
OF OF THE SPS A VENT AND FOR US

01:22:42.057 --> 01:22:44.459
THAT'S DESIGNING CIRCUIT LEVEL

01:22:44.526 --> 01:22:47.162
OF SPECIFICITY SO WE DON'T HAVE

01:22:47.228 --> 01:22:48.330
A BLANKET LEVEL IN EACH EACH

01:22:48.396 --> 01:22:57.038
ZONE WHERE WE DE ENERGIZED.

01:22:57.105 --> 01:22:58.273
WE UNDERSTAND EACH INDIVIDUALS

01:22:58.340 --> 01:22:59.140
CIRCUIT WHERE WE EXPECT TO SEE --

01:22:59.207 --> 01:22:59.741
POTENTIAL PROBLEMS AND THAT

01:22:59.808 --> 01:23:00.875
FORMS THE THRESHOLD SO THAT'S

01:23:00.942 --> 01:23:01.910
ONE WAY OF MINIMIZING FOOTPRINT.

01:23:01.976 --> 01:23:03.678
ADDITIONAL SEXUALIZED IN WHICH

01:23:03.745 --> 01:23:04.646
MR SINGH MENTION HERE -- AGAIN

01:23:04.713 --> 01:23:05.547
OTHER WAYS TO REDUCE THIS AND

01:23:05.613 --> 01:23:06.614
THEN LASTLY GREATER INFORMATION

01:23:06.681 --> 01:23:08.283
FROM THE WEATHER STATIONS FROM

01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:09.818
OTHER PREDICTIVE CAPABILITIES TO

01:23:09.884 --> 01:23:11.086
HELP US HONE IN ON WHEN WE

01:23:11.152 --> 01:23:12.854
REALLY THINK WE WILL NEED TO DO

01:23:12.921 --> 01:23:13.321
THIS.

01:23:13.388 --> 01:23:15.290
THROUGH THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE

01:23:15.357 --> 01:23:17.492
FOR ONE OF THESE IS -- WE DO PRE --

01:23:17.559 --> 01:23:19.094
PREVENT PATROLS WHICH AGAIN

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:21.162
IDENTIFY SHOULD WE DO WANT OTHER

01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:22.297
PROBLEMS ON THE LINE TO MAKE US

01:23:22.364 --> 01:23:23.331
MORE BUYS.

01:23:23.398 --> 01:23:24.532
TWO OF THE REASONS WE SHOULD

01:23:24.599 --> 01:23:25.900
THINK ABOUT THIS THIS HELPS US

01:23:25.967 --> 01:23:27.936
UNDERSTAND WHEN TO DO IT AND

01:23:28.002 --> 01:23:28.370
WHEN NOT TO DO IT.

01:23:28.436 --> 01:23:30.438
AND ON THE GROUND RESOURCES WE

01:23:30.505 --> 01:23:31.673
WILL HAVE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND

01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:33.475
OVER MAKING THESE DECISIONS TO

01:23:33.541 --> 01:23:35.343
ADVISE SO THIS IS AGAIN

01:23:35.410 --> 01:23:36.544
MINIMIZING THE FOOTPRINT.

01:23:36.611 --> 01:23:40.081
WHEN THEY HAPPEN -- WE DO -- IN

01:23:40.148 --> 01:23:41.883
CASES WE LOOK TO OUR AS OUR

01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:44.119
MERGED THE SERVICE PROVIDERS --

01:23:44.185 --> 01:23:44.919
CERTAIN CLASSES OF CUSTOMERS

01:23:44.986 --> 01:23:46.788
WHERE WE ENGAGE IN DISCUSSIONS

01:23:46.855 --> 01:23:48.623
ABOUT PROVIDING BACKUP

01:23:48.690 --> 01:23:49.424
GENERATION SO THAT'S ONE ELEMENT

01:23:49.491 --> 01:23:51.526
OF IT -- ANOTHER ELEMENT OF IT

01:23:51.593 --> 01:23:53.628
IS WE ALSO HAVE PILOT PROGRAMS

01:23:53.695 --> 01:23:55.130
WERE PILING WHICH PROBABLY WITH

01:23:55.196 --> 01:23:57.332
A HIGH SCHOOL IN SOUR JOAQUIN A

01:23:57.399 --> 01:24:00.034
IT'S NOT -- IT'S ALMOST A MICRO

01:24:00.101 --> 01:24:01.302
GOOD IT'S A BACK IT'S A STORAGE

01:24:01.369 --> 01:24:03.271
CELLAR COMBINATION OF THAT WE

01:24:03.338 --> 01:24:04.139
HAVE A RESILIENCY CENTER IF YOU

01:24:04.205 --> 01:24:04.906
WELL.

01:24:04.973 --> 01:24:06.408
BASED ON BATTERY TECHNOLOGIES

01:24:06.474 --> 01:24:07.208
SOLAR TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD

01:24:07.275 --> 01:24:09.411
WITHSTAND -- A PROLONGED PS

01:24:09.477 --> 01:24:10.779
BECAUSE OF THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO

01:24:10.845 --> 01:24:12.080
REPLICATE MORE OF THAT.

01:24:12.147 --> 01:24:13.114
WE ALSO ARE USING MOBILE

01:24:13.181 --> 01:24:15.150
TRAILERS THAT HAVE CHARGING

01:24:15.216 --> 01:24:20.188
STATIONS THAT WE BOTH -- BOTH MY

01:24:20.255 --> 01:24:21.856
COLLEAGUES HERE IS TO APPLY

01:24:21.923 --> 01:24:24.159
PROVIDING PLACES TOGETHER -- I

01:24:24.225 --> 01:24:25.693
REALLY TO POINT OUT ONE OTHER

01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:27.128
THING IN THIS IS.

01:24:27.195 --> 01:24:29.297
WHERE WE PARTNER WITH -- YES --

01:24:29.364 --> 01:24:32.000
ON EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS URGENCY

01:24:32.066 --> 01:24:33.301
SIR THANK YOU OFFICE OF

01:24:33.368 --> 01:24:35.870
EMERGENCY SERVICES GALLO YES

01:24:35.937 --> 01:24:37.772
CALOR OFF TO MERGE THE SERVICES --

01:24:37.839 --> 01:24:39.140
WHO WILL HELP US?

01:24:39.207 --> 01:24:40.909
GET THE WORD OUT ABOUT COMMUNITY

01:24:40.975 --> 01:24:43.111
RESILIENCY BECAUSE ONE OF THINGS

01:24:43.178 --> 01:24:46.815
THAT -- WE WE OFTEN FORGET IS

01:24:46.881 --> 01:24:48.316
THERE ARE OTHER REASONS THAT YOU

01:24:48.383 --> 01:24:49.517
MAY LOSE POWER FOR AN EXTENDED

01:24:49.584 --> 01:24:51.252
PERIOD OF TIME -- CATASTROPHIC

01:24:51.319 --> 01:24:52.987
EVENTS SUCH AS AN EARTHQUAKE --

01:24:53.054 --> 01:24:58.259
OTHER KIND OF SYSTEM DISRUPTIONS.

01:24:58.326 --> 01:24:58.993
SO WHAT WE WE WE THINK IT'S

01:24:59.060 --> 01:24:59.527
IMPORTANT TO EDUCATE THE

01:24:59.594 --> 01:25:00.328
CUSTOMER THE COMMUNITY ABOUT

01:25:00.395 --> 01:25:03.131
RESILIENCY AND BECOMING PREPARED

01:25:03.198 --> 01:25:03.698
FOR OTHER THINGS THAT MIGHT

01:25:03.765 --> 01:25:05.600
HAPPEN SO THERE'S MULTIPLE

01:25:05.667 --> 01:25:06.201
PRONGS TO THIS.

01:25:06.267 --> 01:25:07.836
ABOUT HIS CLOTHES WITH THIS IS

01:25:07.902 --> 01:25:09.771
ALSO SOMETHING WERE INVOLVING --

01:25:09.838 --> 01:25:11.372
TO LEARN MORE ABOUT AND MAYBE

01:25:11.439 --> 01:25:12.207
THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IS

01:25:12.273 --> 01:25:14.075
ULTIMATELY THE SYSTEM HARDING

01:25:14.142 --> 01:25:14.809
THAT WE DO.

01:25:14.876 --> 01:25:16.911
WILL BRIDGES TO A TIME WHEN

01:25:16.978 --> 01:25:17.512
THESE ARE LESS AND LESS LIKELY

01:25:17.579 --> 01:25:19.948
THE MORE YOUR SYSTEM'S HARDENED

01:25:20.014 --> 01:25:21.616
AND IS LESS LIKELY TO BE --

01:25:21.683 --> 01:25:24.185
IMPACTED BY CONDITIONS WHICH

01:25:24.252 --> 01:25:26.621
CAUSES TO DO PS PS THE LOTS OF

01:25:26.688 --> 01:25:29.224
THESE WILL HAVE MET PROBABLY IN

01:25:29.290 --> 01:25:31.926
THE SHRINKING THE FOOTPRINT.

01:25:31.993 --> 01:25:33.127
THE THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD

01:25:33.194 --> 01:25:35.163
TO THAT -- IN THAT -- COVERED

01:25:35.230 --> 01:25:36.865
WALLS -- FILL FROM MY

01:25:36.931 --> 01:25:37.365
PERSPECTIVE.

01:25:37.432 --> 01:25:38.900
THE OTHER AVENUE FROM A

01:25:38.967 --> 01:25:40.635
EDUCATION AWARENESS PERSPECTIVE

01:25:40.702 --> 01:25:42.036
IS OF THE LAW THE CRITICAL

01:25:42.103 --> 01:25:42.804
ESSENTIAL CUSTOMERS SO AND

01:25:42.871 --> 01:25:44.672
SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED TO

01:25:44.739 --> 01:25:45.240
THE COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF

01:25:45.306 --> 01:25:45.907
HOSPITALS.

01:25:45.974 --> 01:25:47.342
FROM THE WATER AGENCIES WASTE

01:25:47.408 --> 01:25:49.644
WATER AGENCIES -- FROM EDUCATION

01:25:49.711 --> 01:25:51.412
AND AND PREPAREDNESS PERSPECTIVE

01:25:51.479 --> 01:25:52.881
THAT THERE CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS

01:25:52.947 --> 01:25:54.549
THAT REQUIRE THEM TO ALSO HAVE

01:25:54.616 --> 01:25:56.084
BACKUP GENERATION SO.

01:25:56.150 --> 01:25:56.985
YOU KNOW HAVING THAT HEIGHTENED

01:25:57.051 --> 01:25:58.586
AWARENESS -- THAT THIS IS A

01:25:58.653 --> 01:26:01.055
REALITY -- GIVEN THE EXTREME

01:26:01.122 --> 01:26:02.524
NATURE OF THE WILD FIRE RISK ON

01:26:02.590 --> 01:26:03.625
THE CLIMATE CHANGE.

01:26:03.691 --> 01:26:04.993
THAT WE'RE FACING WITHIN THE

01:26:05.059 --> 01:26:07.128
STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- KIND OF A

01:26:07.195 --> 01:26:08.196
BRIDGE SOLUTION IF YOU WANT TO

01:26:08.263 --> 01:26:10.164
CALL IT RIGHT IN TERMS OF THE

01:26:10.231 --> 01:26:11.666
PROACTIVE THE LEGISLATION.

01:26:11.733 --> 01:26:12.133
IS SOMETHING WE DON'T

01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:13.735
NECESSARILY SEE THAT COMPLETELY

01:26:13.801 --> 01:26:15.770
GOES AWAY BUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF

01:26:15.837 --> 01:26:17.372
EXERCISING IT.

01:26:17.438 --> 01:26:19.140
REDUCES AS WE CONTINUE TO MAKE

01:26:19.207 --> 01:26:20.775
SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS

01:26:20.842 --> 01:26:22.143
IN REGARDS TO THE IN HAS

01:26:22.210 --> 01:26:23.745
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS

01:26:23.811 --> 01:26:25.413
THE SYSTEM HARD BANG -- WERE

01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:26.981
ALSO -- PILOTING -- INTENTIONAL

01:26:27.048 --> 01:26:28.516
TECHNOLOGY THAT'S AFTER COMING

01:26:28.583 --> 01:26:30.552
OUT OF THE STATE OF VICTORIA IN

01:26:30.618 --> 01:26:31.386
AUSTRALIA.

01:26:31.452 --> 01:26:32.954
THAT HAS HAD SOME VERY SIMILAR

01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:35.723
ISSUES CALLED -- THE RAPID EARTH

01:26:35.790 --> 01:26:37.458
FAULT CURRENT LIMITER AND REALLY

01:26:37.525 --> 01:26:38.860
THE UNDERLYING PREMISE OF THAT.

01:26:38.927 --> 01:26:40.628
TECHNOLOGY IS TO BE ABLE TO

01:26:40.695 --> 01:26:42.163
REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY.

01:26:42.230 --> 01:26:44.399
THAT FLOWS THROUGH THE THE

01:26:44.465 --> 01:26:46.234
ACTUAL -- THE CONDUCTOR OR BARE

01:26:46.301 --> 01:26:49.203
WIRE -- AND WHEN IT DOES SUFFER --

01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:50.638
IT ACTUALLY -- REDUCES THE

01:26:50.705 --> 01:26:51.806
AMOUNT OF ENERGY TO THE POINT

01:26:51.873 --> 01:26:52.407
WHERE IT DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH

01:26:52.473 --> 01:26:55.510
ENERGY TO CREATE A FIRE IGNITION

01:26:55.577 --> 01:26:57.312
EVENT -- AND THEY'VE ACTUALLY

01:26:57.378 --> 01:26:59.047
SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED IT --

01:26:59.113 --> 01:27:00.415
AND PROVEN IT -- IN SUCH A

01:27:00.481 --> 01:27:01.683
BECOME PART OF THEIR LEGISLATIVE

01:27:01.749 --> 01:27:03.384
REQUIREMENT WITHIN THE STATE OF

01:27:03.451 --> 01:27:05.086
VICTORIA -- AND THAT'S SOMETHING

01:27:05.153 --> 01:27:06.721
THAT -- WE'RE CURRENTLY PILOTING

01:27:06.788 --> 01:27:13.995
AND UP LOOKING TO ACTIVELY

01:27:14.062 --> 01:27:15.263
PURSUE AS WELL.

01:27:15.330 --> 01:27:16.731
AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN SAN DIEGO

01:27:16.798 --> 01:27:17.365
IN ADDITION TO THIS SUCH AS AS

01:27:17.432 --> 01:27:17.966
COVERED IT REALLY WELL I DON'T

01:27:18.032 --> 01:27:18.866
THINK WE FOUND THE SAME SOLUTION

01:27:18.933 --> 01:27:19.767
IT'S IT'S ALMOST THERE'S BEEN

01:27:19.834 --> 01:27:20.234
UNIQUE.

01:27:20.301 --> 01:27:21.903
IMPLEMENTATIONS OF THIS KIND OF

01:27:21.970 --> 01:27:23.104
MITIGATION STRATEGY FOR

01:27:23.171 --> 01:27:25.340
DIFFERENT SOLUTION SOME EXAMPLES

01:27:25.406 --> 01:27:26.975
ONE OF OUR TRIBAL NATIONS YOU

01:27:27.041 --> 01:27:28.142
KNOW WE'VE WORKED WITH THEM THEY

01:27:28.209 --> 01:27:29.477
SAID WE REALLY NEED.

01:27:29.544 --> 01:27:31.713
THIS AREA TO REMAIN ENERGIZED SO

01:27:31.779 --> 01:27:32.814
WE WORKED WITH THE TRIBE IN WHEN

01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:34.716
AND CLEARED ALL THE VEGETATION

01:27:34.782 --> 01:27:36.451
UNDER PARTICULAR LINES WE

01:27:36.517 --> 01:27:37.919
STATION A CONTRACT FIREFIGHTING

01:27:37.986 --> 01:27:39.721
RESOURCES THERE AND WE'VE BEEN

01:27:39.787 --> 01:27:41.723
ABLE TO SERVE THAT -- COMMUNITY

01:27:41.789 --> 01:27:43.458
THAT WAY ANOTHER ONE WE'RE

01:27:43.524 --> 01:27:44.959
LOOKING AT YOU KNOW MORE THE

01:27:45.026 --> 01:27:46.628
TRADITIONAL CAN WE PUT A BATTERY

01:27:46.694 --> 01:27:49.163
WALL AND SOLAR PANELS AT THOSE

01:27:49.230 --> 01:27:50.999
COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS AND

01:27:51.065 --> 01:27:52.100
KEEP THOSE GOING.

01:27:52.166 --> 01:27:53.201
THERE ARE SOME OTHER PLACES

01:27:53.267 --> 01:27:54.335
WHERE IT MAKES SENSE FOR US TO

01:27:54.402 --> 01:27:56.304
DO SOME SHORT SPANS OF STRATEGIC

01:27:56.371 --> 01:27:57.405
UNDERGROUND ACT.

01:27:57.472 --> 01:27:58.906
AND THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO ENABLE

01:27:58.973 --> 01:28:01.109
US TO KEEP A DOWNTOWN AREA

01:28:01.175 --> 01:28:03.077
ENERGIZED BUT I THE POINT BEING

01:28:03.144 --> 01:28:04.679
IS THAT A LOT OF WHAT WE FOUND

01:28:04.746 --> 01:28:05.513
IS THAT.

01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:06.914
WHAT WORKS FOR ONE COMMUNITY

01:28:06.981 --> 01:28:07.782
MIGHT BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN

01:28:07.849 --> 01:28:09.117
ANOTHER BUT WORKING WITH THE

01:28:09.183 --> 01:28:10.685
COMMUNITY WE CAN WORK TOWARDS

01:28:10.752 --> 01:28:12.453
THESE SOLUTIONS AND IT IT DOES

01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:15.156
BECOME A COMMUNITY?

01:28:15.223 --> 01:28:16.524
BASED SOLUTION.

01:28:16.591 --> 01:28:18.559
I APPRECIATE THAT [inaudible]

01:28:18.626 --> 01:28:22.130
DOCTOR EGGMAN.

01:28:22.196 --> 01:28:22.697
THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE

01:28:22.764 --> 01:28:24.599
TODAY.

01:28:24.666 --> 01:28:27.168
I REMEMBER YOUR JOBS I WANNA BE

01:28:27.235 --> 01:28:30.138
MINE EITHER AND FOR YEARS --

01:28:30.204 --> 01:28:31.339
KIND OF THREE GENERAL QUESTIONS

01:28:31.406 --> 01:28:32.540
IN A AND I THINK YOU'VE YOU'VE

01:28:32.607 --> 01:28:34.509
SOMEWHAT ADDRESS THEM IN THE

01:28:34.575 --> 01:28:36.911
ISSUE OF DECREASING POWER

01:28:36.978 --> 01:28:38.079
SHUTTING IT DOWN.

01:28:38.146 --> 01:28:39.881
IS MICROBE GRADES A BETTER WAY

01:28:39.947 --> 01:28:41.416
TO GO WITH BACKUP BATTERY AND DO

01:28:41.482 --> 01:28:43.217
WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO KIND OF

01:28:43.284 --> 01:28:44.619
PATCHWORK AROUND THE STATE.

01:28:44.686 --> 01:28:46.187
SOME PLACES THAT ARE MIGRATED

01:28:46.254 --> 01:28:47.288
WERE AND THEN BE ABLE TO GET THE

01:28:47.355 --> 01:28:49.023
SYSTEM BACK UP IN A TIMELY

01:28:49.090 --> 01:28:50.391
FASHION BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S

01:28:50.458 --> 01:28:53.261
ALWAYS BEEN THE CONCERN.

01:28:53.327 --> 01:28:53.428
UP.

01:28:53.494 --> 01:28:54.862
HERE THE QUESTIONS AROUND.

01:28:54.929 --> 01:28:56.230
THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF

01:28:56.297 --> 01:28:58.466
HARDENING ALL THE LINES VERSES

01:28:58.533 --> 01:28:59.434
UNDER GROUNDING EVERYTHING

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:00.101
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

01:29:00.168 --> 01:29:01.135
CONVERSATION ABOUT UNDER

01:29:01.202 --> 01:29:02.637
GRANTING I KNOW THERE'S SOME

01:29:02.704 --> 01:29:04.005
THINGS ARE COST PROHIBITIVE BUT

01:29:04.072 --> 01:29:05.606
IS THAT ALSO LIKE YOU'VE SAID.

01:29:05.673 --> 01:29:08.076
IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE

01:29:08.142 --> 01:29:08.676
THERE'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT

01:29:08.743 --> 01:29:08.976
[inaudible]

01:29:09.043 --> 01:29:10.478
DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS.

01:29:10.545 --> 01:29:11.312
AND THEN AS WE'RE STILL GOING TO

01:29:11.379 --> 01:29:12.947
THE NINE A ONE PROCESS AT ALL OF

01:29:13.014 --> 01:29:14.315
THAT IS COMING IN.

01:29:14.382 --> 01:29:15.950
THE PLANS ARE COMING IN.

01:29:16.017 --> 01:29:16.784
YOU KNOW WHAT IF WHAT IF

01:29:16.851 --> 01:29:17.952
DIFFERENT.

01:29:18.019 --> 01:29:19.554
THINGS ARE FOUND AFTER NINE A

01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:20.922
ONE AND THEN WHAT WILL BE YOUR

01:29:20.988 --> 01:29:23.157
UPDATING PROCESS AS WE GO

01:29:23.224 --> 01:29:27.395
FORWARD WITH THAT.

01:29:27.462 --> 01:29:29.864
DO YOU WANT TO START GRABBED THE

01:29:29.931 --> 01:29:31.999
GO AHEAD OKAY.

01:29:32.066 --> 01:29:32.600
IT WOULDN'T WHEN WE LOOK AT

01:29:32.667 --> 01:29:35.470
LARGE SCALE DEPLOYMENT OF

01:29:35.536 --> 01:29:38.139
MICROGRAMS WE WE HAVE ULTIMATELY

01:29:38.206 --> 01:29:40.675
LOOKED AT THOSE AS A TOOL FOR

01:29:40.742 --> 01:29:42.744
FOR RESILIENCE -- BUT IT'S NOT

01:29:42.810 --> 01:29:44.378
SOMETHING RIGHT NOW THAT IS

01:29:44.445 --> 01:29:45.580
BEING.

01:29:45.646 --> 01:29:49.117
DEPLOYED ON A ON A WIDE SCALE --

01:29:49.183 --> 01:29:51.319
TYPE OF FEATURE ACROSS SAN DIEGO

01:29:51.385 --> 01:29:53.521
WE FIND MORE RIGHT NOW IT'S BY A

01:29:53.588 --> 01:29:54.689
PARTICULAR RESIDENTS WERE

01:29:54.756 --> 01:29:55.890
LOOKING AT IT AND WE'RE WE'RE

01:29:55.957 --> 01:29:57.458
TRYING TO FIND ITS PLACE IN THE

01:29:57.525 --> 01:29:58.993
RESILIENCE PORTFOLIO BUT RIGHT

01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:00.795
NOW IT'S NOT.

01:30:00.862 --> 01:30:03.264
GOING INTO A LARGE SCALE --

01:30:03.331 --> 01:30:04.365
DEPLOYMENT.

01:30:04.432 --> 01:30:07.301
IN TERMS BECAUSE IT JUST COST OR

01:30:07.368 --> 01:30:08.870
PRACTICALITY WON'T PART OF IT

01:30:08.936 --> 01:30:10.304
THAT THE CHAIR MENTIONED IT

01:30:10.371 --> 01:30:11.939
EARLIER IS THAT MICROGRAMS

01:30:12.006 --> 01:30:13.708
REQUIRE IT TO TRULY BE FULLY

01:30:13.775 --> 01:30:15.409
RESILIENT AN UNDERGROUND

01:30:15.476 --> 01:30:16.711
DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM ALONG WITH

01:30:16.778 --> 01:30:17.111
IT.

01:30:17.178 --> 01:30:19.180
SO THERE ARE SOME -- INHIBITING

01:30:19.247 --> 01:30:20.915
FACTORS IF IT WENT WHEN YOU

01:30:20.982 --> 01:30:23.184
REALLY START TO TO LOOK AT ITS

01:30:23.251 --> 01:30:24.752
ITS APPLICATION IS A FIRE

01:30:24.819 --> 01:30:27.355
RESILIENCE TOOL -- BUT WE WE DO

01:30:27.421 --> 01:30:28.389
THINK THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME

01:30:28.456 --> 01:30:30.224
PLACES WHERE IT IT DOES HAVE ITS

01:30:30.291 --> 01:30:31.959
PLACE IN THAT RESILIENCE

01:30:32.026 --> 01:30:35.196
PORTFOLIO -- WHEN WE LOOK AT

01:30:35.263 --> 01:30:36.330
HARDENING?

01:30:36.397 --> 01:30:38.432
ARMED FORCES UNDER GROUNDING --

01:30:38.499 --> 01:30:40.368
IT'S THERE THERE ARE TWO VERY

01:30:40.434 --> 01:30:43.171
DIFFERENT COST -- COST.

01:30:43.237 --> 01:30:45.273
PROFILES -- WERE UNDER GROUNDING

01:30:45.339 --> 01:30:47.508
IS EXTENSIVELY MORE -- COST

01:30:47.575 --> 01:30:49.343
PROHIBITIVE IN SOME CASES AND

01:30:49.410 --> 01:30:52.180
PART OF THE THE REASON IS THAT.

01:30:52.246 --> 01:30:53.915
YOU COULD REPLACE A LINE BUT TO

01:30:53.981 --> 01:30:55.683
UNDERGROUND YOU MAY HAVE TO

01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:56.918
FOLLOW A ROAD SYSTEM IT MAY TAKE.

01:30:56.984 --> 01:30:58.820
FAR MORE UNDER GROUNDING TO

01:30:58.886 --> 01:31:00.855
REPLACE IT THAN JUST FOLLOWING

01:31:00.922 --> 01:31:03.124
THE PATH OF THE CURRENT OVERHEAD

01:31:03.191 --> 01:31:04.325
WHICH CAN MAKE IT TANA VASTLY

01:31:04.392 --> 01:31:06.561
MORE EXPENSIVE -- AND THEN IN

01:31:06.627 --> 01:31:08.496
TERMS OF NINE OH ONE THERE'S A

01:31:08.563 --> 01:31:10.731
CONTINUOUS EVOLUTION OF THIS PRO

01:31:10.798 --> 01:31:12.466
OF OUR FIRE MITIGATION PROGRAM

01:31:12.533 --> 01:31:14.035
THERE HAS BEEN FOR A DECADE IN

01:31:14.101 --> 01:31:15.703
THERE WILL BE. NINE OH ONE THIS

01:31:15.770 --> 01:31:17.805
IS A GUIDE YOU KNOW IT GUIDES

01:31:17.872 --> 01:31:18.339
DOWN I RIGHTS WHAT WE'RE

01:31:18.406 --> 01:31:19.974
PLANNING TO DO BUT THAT BEING

01:31:20.041 --> 01:31:22.476
SAID AS TECHNOLOGY EVOLVES -- WE

01:31:22.543 --> 01:31:24.145
CONTINUE TO EVOLVE WITH IT AND

01:31:24.212 --> 01:31:25.146
WILL CAPTURE EVERYTHING WE'RE

01:31:25.213 --> 01:31:26.647
DOING IN THESE PLANS BUT IT

01:31:26.714 --> 01:31:28.316
WOULD NEVER PREVENT US FROM

01:31:28.382 --> 01:31:31.652
EVOLVING OR INTEGRATING THE NEXT

01:31:31.719 --> 01:31:34.689
TECHNOLOGY. FIVE PEOPLE JUST

01:31:34.755 --> 01:31:35.690
ALONG TO THAT -- TO IN IN TERMS

01:31:35.756 --> 01:31:37.458
OF MY PROGRESS I THINK THERE'S

01:31:37.525 --> 01:31:39.060
ALSO THE ELEMENT FROM A BATTERY

01:31:39.126 --> 01:31:40.895
STORAGE -- ENABLEMENT

01:31:40.962 --> 01:31:42.630
PERSPECTIVE OF SPECIAL WE START

01:31:42.697 --> 01:31:44.498
THINKING ABOUT THE DURATION OF

01:31:44.565 --> 01:31:46.000
THE POTENTIAL DEALER DOES ATION

01:31:46.067 --> 01:31:48.002
EVENTS SOME OF THESE.

01:31:48.069 --> 01:31:48.836
ABOUT FLOOD WARNINGS ARE THE

01:31:48.903 --> 01:31:51.005
CONDITIONS CAN LAST TWENTY FOUR

01:31:51.072 --> 01:31:52.506
THIRTY SIX HOURS AND BUT AFTER

01:31:52.573 --> 01:31:54.275
THAT CONDITION HAS PASSED ON THE

01:31:54.342 --> 01:31:56.077
SYSTEM -- BUT WE WE CAN'T JUST

01:31:56.143 --> 01:31:58.679
GO IN AND RE ENERGIZE WE INSURE

01:31:58.746 --> 01:31:59.780
THAT WE DO THE SAFETY

01:31:59.847 --> 01:32:00.882
INSPECTIONS.

01:32:00.948 --> 01:32:03.284
ON ALL OF OUR DE ENERGIZED LINES

01:32:03.351 --> 01:32:05.653
TO IDENTIFY ANY POTENTIAL IMPACT

01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:07.154
THAT MAY HAVE OCCURRED SO WE

01:32:07.221 --> 01:32:08.723
INSPECT EVERY INCH OF THE LINE

01:32:08.789 --> 01:32:09.924
THAT WAS -- IMPACTED FROM

01:32:09.991 --> 01:32:11.158
AUDIENCES ATION PERSPECTIVE

01:32:11.225 --> 01:32:12.727
EITHER LEVERAGING AERIAL FLEET

01:32:12.793 --> 01:32:15.463
OR QUALIFIED -- GROUND PERSONNEL

01:32:15.529 --> 01:32:16.130
SO IN SOME CASES WE CAN HAVE AN

01:32:16.197 --> 01:32:16.898
EVENT.

01:32:16.964 --> 01:32:19.233
THAT MAY LAST MULTIPLE DAYS

01:32:19.300 --> 01:32:20.134
THREE FOUR FIVE DAYS AND I THINK

01:32:20.201 --> 01:32:22.370
FROM MY MY VANTAGE POINT YOU

01:32:22.436 --> 01:32:23.738
KNOW THE AN ABLE MAN DOWN THE

01:32:23.804 --> 01:32:24.672
CAPABILITY OF THE STORAGE MARKET

01:32:24.739 --> 01:32:26.007
YOU KNOW IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY

01:32:26.073 --> 01:32:28.042
THAT CONTINUES. TO EVOLVE FROM A

01:32:28.109 --> 01:32:29.911
TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT

01:32:29.977 --> 01:32:32.313
PERSPECTIVE -- BUT IF I JUST

01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:33.814
BUILD ON STREET DAY AUGUSTINE'S

01:32:33.881 --> 01:32:35.917
POINT REGARDING SYSTEM HARDENING

01:32:35.983 --> 01:32:36.751
AN UNDERGROUND.

01:32:36.817 --> 01:32:38.152
THE DIMENSION THAT WE'VE LOOKED

01:32:38.219 --> 01:32:39.053
AT THIS FROM.

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:40.988
VERY CONSISTENT -- AS WELL AS

01:32:41.055 --> 01:32:42.356
OUTLINED.

01:32:42.423 --> 01:32:44.425
BUT NOT JUST AT THE COST PIECE

01:32:44.492 --> 01:32:45.927
IS ALSO A PACE PIECE OF THIS --

01:32:45.993 --> 01:32:47.595
IN TERMS OF DOING UNDER

01:32:47.662 --> 01:32:49.630
GROUNDING TAKES MUCH LONGER AND

01:32:49.697 --> 01:32:51.232
THEN THE VIEW POINT THAT WE HAVE

01:32:51.299 --> 01:32:53.267
ON THIS IS -- TO THE LONGER SOME

01:32:53.334 --> 01:32:55.503
MEDICATIONS TAKE THE LONGER THE

01:32:55.569 --> 01:32:57.505
WRIST EXPOSURES OUT THERE RIGHT

01:32:57.571 --> 01:32:58.973
SO -- THAT THAT'S YOU KNOW BUT

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:00.408
ONE A DIMENSION OF THIS AS WELL

01:33:00.474 --> 01:33:01.876
AND AND WE DO HAVE UNDER

01:33:01.943 --> 01:33:03.611
GROUNDING.

01:33:03.678 --> 01:33:05.112
AS A STRATEGIC.

01:33:05.179 --> 01:33:05.947
INITIATIVE IF YOU WANT TO CALL

01:33:06.013 --> 01:33:07.815
IT AS PART OF THE THE SUITE OF

01:33:07.882 --> 01:33:10.985
SYSTEM -- HARDENING OF RENDON

01:33:11.052 --> 01:33:19.994
RESILIENCY PROCESS OVERALL.

01:33:20.061 --> 01:33:20.628
BECAUSE UNDER GROUNDING ALSO IS

01:33:20.695 --> 01:33:21.228
NOT.

01:33:21.295 --> 01:33:22.596
FREE FROM A RISK PERSPECTIVE YES

01:33:22.663 --> 01:33:24.065
IT COMPLETELY YOU KNOW REDUCES

01:33:24.131 --> 01:33:24.899
FOR THE MOST PART THE WILD FIRE

01:33:24.966 --> 01:33:25.733
RISK BUT THERE'S OTHER ELEVATED

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:26.367
RISK THAT HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED

01:33:26.434 --> 01:33:27.802
IN TERMS OF IMPACT AS A RESULT

01:33:27.868 --> 01:33:29.036
OF POTENTIAL LANDSLIDE.

01:33:29.103 --> 01:33:30.571
DICK AND SUSCEPTIBILITY. TO

01:33:30.638 --> 01:33:31.839
MODEL REPAIR TIME IT TAKES WHEN

01:33:31.906 --> 01:33:33.207
THERE'S AN IMPACT TO UNDERGROUND

01:33:33.274 --> 01:33:34.909
LINE ALSO THERE'S A SET OF

01:33:34.976 --> 01:33:35.609
ELEVATED.

01:33:35.676 --> 01:33:36.243
OF RISK FACTORS THAT HAVE TO BE

01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:36.777
CONSIDERED IN THE DECISION

01:33:36.844 --> 01:33:38.079
MAKING PROCESS.

01:33:38.145 --> 01:33:38.879
AND THEN IN REGARDS TO THE

01:33:38.946 --> 01:33:40.247
UPDATE FOR THE SB NOT A ONE

01:33:40.314 --> 01:33:42.016
WE'RE GONNA BE FILING.

01:33:42.083 --> 01:33:43.718
A LOT FOR MEDICATION PLAN ON

01:33:43.784 --> 01:33:46.287
ANNUAL BASIS -- AND IN THE PLAN

01:33:46.354 --> 01:33:47.221
OUTLINES.

01:33:47.288 --> 01:33:49.156
YOU KNOW KIND OF THE THE THE

01:33:49.223 --> 01:33:50.691
FLOOR FROM MY PERSPECTIVE ON YOU

01:33:50.758 --> 01:33:51.859
KNOW ALL THE THINGS THAT WE'VE

01:33:51.926 --> 01:33:53.461
ACTUALLY PUT FORWARD -- BUT IF

01:33:53.527 --> 01:33:54.228
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT COMES

01:33:54.295 --> 01:33:56.664
ALONG DURING THAT ONE YEAR TIME

01:33:56.731 --> 01:33:58.933
FRAME THE ONLY FULLY ANTICIPATE --

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.334
TO IMPLEMENT AND LEVERAGE THAT

01:34:00.401 --> 01:34:02.036
AND THEN MAKE THAT UPDATE -- AS

01:34:02.103 --> 01:34:07.708
AT THE NEXT OPPORTUNITY WITHIN

01:34:07.775 --> 01:34:10.644
THE BY THE TORY FALLING PROCESS.

01:34:10.711 --> 01:34:11.912
THANKS TO I'M GONNA GET A

01:34:11.979 --> 01:34:13.781
COLLEAGUES HAD MOST OF IT HERE --

01:34:13.848 --> 01:34:14.548
AND I JUST A COUPLE OF EXTRA

01:34:14.615 --> 01:34:15.683
POINTS -- THE GROWTH THINKING

01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:16.484
ABOUT MICHAEL GOODS AND A GREAT

01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:17.084
AND A GROUNDING IN A SIMILAR

01:34:17.151 --> 01:34:17.585
CONTEXT WHICH IS THEIR

01:34:17.651 --> 01:34:19.053
APPLICATIONS WHERE THAT IS A

01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:20.488
GOOD SOLUTION BOTH PARKER GRADES

01:34:20.554 --> 01:34:21.789
IN UNDERGROUND AND APPLICATIONS

01:34:21.856 --> 01:34:22.423
WHERE IT'S NOT SO WE'RE LOOKING

01:34:22.490 --> 01:34:23.724
AT THIS IS WHAT FITS BEST FOR

01:34:23.791 --> 01:34:25.993
THE THE PARTICULAR APPLICATION.

01:34:26.060 --> 01:34:26.961
AGAIN I THINK FOR US THE

01:34:27.028 --> 01:34:28.629
UNDERGROUND AND ONE OF THEM IS --

01:34:28.696 --> 01:34:30.798
MISTER SING AT THE IS THE TIME

01:34:30.865 --> 01:34:32.533
IT ACTUALLY TAKES TO TO DO THIS

01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:33.801
DEPLOYMENT ONE OF THE REASONS

01:34:33.868 --> 01:34:35.936
WE'RE FOCUSING ON COVER

01:34:36.003 --> 01:34:37.738
CONDUCTOR IS TO REALLY THE RAPID

01:34:37.805 --> 01:34:39.240
REPEATEDLY WHICH WE CAN DEPLOY

01:34:39.306 --> 01:34:40.107
THE SOLUTION.

01:34:40.174 --> 01:34:41.675
AND GET MUCH OF THE BENEFIT OF

01:34:41.742 --> 01:34:43.244
UNDERGROUND IN WITH A COVERING

01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:45.446
NOT NOT ALL THAT MUCH OF IT SO --

01:34:45.513 --> 01:34:46.147
THE YOU KNOW THOSE ARE THINGS WE

01:34:46.213 --> 01:34:47.748
THINK THROUGH UNDERGROUND AND WE

01:34:47.815 --> 01:34:48.949
WILL DO UNDER GROUNDING IS A

01:34:49.016 --> 01:34:50.418
RELATES TO WALL FIRE MITIGATION

01:34:50.484 --> 01:34:51.919
IS HE'S IS WHERE IT HAS A RIGHT

01:34:51.986 --> 01:34:53.988
APPLICATION -- THE POINT I WOULD

01:34:54.055 --> 01:34:56.023
ALSO CLOSE ON A CONTINUOUS

01:34:56.090 --> 01:34:56.657
AMOUNT OF CHANGE THAT WE EXPECT

01:34:56.724 --> 01:34:59.126
TO SEE BOB EVEN YEAR ON YEAR.

01:34:59.193 --> 01:35:06.767
WE'RE SEEING NEW TECHNOLOGIES

01:35:06.834 --> 01:35:09.737
EMERGE THE A FREQUENTLY NOW ONES

01:35:09.804 --> 01:35:10.771
THAT HAVE A DIRECT APPLICATION.

01:35:10.838 --> 01:35:11.372
ONE OF THE BIG ONES IS HOW ARE

01:35:11.439 --> 01:35:12.706
USING DATA ANALYTICS IN MACHINE

01:35:12.773 --> 01:35:13.207
LEARNING.

01:35:13.274 --> 01:35:13.841
THEY THEY EVEN CAN FIND THEIR

01:35:13.908 --> 01:35:14.742
WAY INTO SOME OF THE MORE BASIC

01:35:14.809 --> 01:35:15.609
THINGS WERE DOING TERMS OF

01:35:15.676 --> 01:35:17.178
LOCATING COVER CONDUCTOR AND

01:35:17.244 --> 01:35:18.412
WORDS BASS AS WE GET MORE AND

01:35:18.479 --> 01:35:18.612
MORE.

01:35:18.679 --> 01:35:20.181
INFORMATION ALLOWS US TO

01:35:20.247 --> 01:35:22.216
PRIORITIZE OR THE NEXT BEST MILE

01:35:22.283 --> 01:35:24.585
IS THAT REALLY HELPS TO INFORM

01:35:24.652 --> 01:35:25.820
US AND MANY SURE THAT WERE

01:35:25.886 --> 01:35:27.088
REDUCING RISK AS QUICKLY AS WE

01:35:27.154 --> 01:35:28.556
CAN.

01:35:28.622 --> 01:35:29.590
SO YOU'LL SEE THAT YOU'LL SEE

01:35:29.657 --> 01:35:31.759
THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES A RAPID

01:35:31.826 --> 01:35:33.260
EARTH FALL LIMITERS -- OTHER

01:35:33.327 --> 01:35:34.462
TECHNOLOGIES THAT THAT

01:35:34.528 --> 01:35:36.330
ALTERNATELY WILL HELP US TO AN

01:35:36.397 --> 01:35:37.431
EVEN BETTER JOB ONCE IT BUT

01:35:37.498 --> 01:35:38.799
WE'RE PROBABLY NOT ENVISIONING

01:35:38.866 --> 01:35:39.867
RIGHT NOW BUT IN TWO OR THREE

01:35:39.934 --> 01:35:40.434
YEARS.

01:35:40.501 --> 01:35:41.802
DEL MARCH AND WE WANT TO PULL

01:35:41.869 --> 01:35:43.437
THOSE IN OUR PLAN -- THAT'S

01:35:43.504 --> 01:35:45.005
THAT'S PART OF OUR PROGRAM AND

01:35:45.072 --> 01:35:46.674
HOW WE'RE LOOKING AT IT.

01:35:46.740 --> 01:35:48.742
I THINK IN JUST TWO QUICK THINGS.

01:35:48.809 --> 01:35:49.643
ONE I MEAN AS WE KNOW IT'S

01:35:49.710 --> 01:35:51.946
RAINING AGAIN RIGHT SO WE KNOW

01:35:52.012 --> 01:35:56.383
WILDFIRE SEASON IS GOING TO BE.

01:35:56.450 --> 01:35:56.917
IT'S GONNA BE ANOTHER BAD

01:35:56.984 --> 01:35:57.218
[inaudible]

01:35:57.284 --> 01:35:59.220
ONE I MEAN.

01:35:59.286 --> 01:35:59.720
AND THIS IS A SOMEONE A

01:35:59.787 --> 01:36:00.521
RHETORICAL QUESTION BUT HOW DO

01:36:00.588 --> 01:36:01.188
WE TRUST THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE.

01:36:01.255 --> 01:36:01.822
CONTINUING TO MAINTAIN

01:36:01.889 --> 01:36:03.491
CONTINUING TO GO BACK I MEAN.

01:36:03.557 --> 01:36:05.159
FOR THE SCIENTIFIC PROCESS RIGHT

01:36:05.226 --> 01:36:06.861
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WHAT'S THE

01:36:06.927 --> 01:36:08.095
ANALYSIS WHAT'S THE AMP

01:36:08.162 --> 01:36:10.064
IMPLEMENTATION AND WHAT'S THE

01:36:10.131 --> 01:36:11.665
ONGOING EVALUATION.

01:36:11.732 --> 01:36:13.067
HOW DO YOU HOW TO CONVINCE US IN

01:36:13.134 --> 01:36:14.468
THE PUBLIC?

01:36:14.535 --> 01:36:15.803
THAT THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:17.605
AND ENDED BY LAST QUESTION AS AN

01:36:17.671 --> 01:36:18.572
ASIDE WERE YOU GETTING ALL THESE

01:36:18.639 --> 01:36:19.473
WORKERS ARE LET'S TALK ABOUT

01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:21.308
LABOR SHORTAGE IN GOING FROM

01:36:21.375 --> 01:36:24.945
SIXTEEN HUNDRED ALMOST THREE

01:36:25.012 --> 01:36:25.579
THOUSAND THAT'S A THAT WERE THEY

01:36:25.646 --> 01:36:28.682
COMING FROM.

01:36:28.749 --> 01:36:29.850
DACULA MISSING AS WELL JUST

01:36:29.917 --> 01:36:30.818
WORKING BACKWARDS ON THE OF THE

01:36:30.885 --> 01:36:31.819
LABOR SHOULD GET WE HAVE BROUGHT.

01:36:31.886 --> 01:36:32.686
A HUNDREDS OF ADDITIONAL WORKERS

01:36:32.753 --> 01:36:34.655
IN MANY FROM OUT OF STATE -- TO

01:36:34.722 --> 01:36:35.756
HELP DO THIS WORK AND THE LABOR

01:36:35.823 --> 01:36:37.491
MARKET IS GETTING TIGHT AND WE

01:36:37.558 --> 01:36:39.894
WILL -- WE WILL SEE THAT --

01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:40.961
WE'RE DOING A LOT OF INTERNAL

01:36:41.028 --> 01:36:42.363
TRAINING AS WELL WERE WE LOOKING

01:36:42.429 --> 01:36:44.365
AT HOW WE DO SOME THINGS WITH A

01:36:44.431 --> 01:36:46.300
NOD TO EFFICIENCY THIS IS

01:36:46.367 --> 01:36:48.802
PERHAPS LESS ON THE THE THE THE

01:36:48.869 --> 01:36:50.404
THE ACTUAL A DEPLOYMENT THE

01:36:50.471 --> 01:36:52.006
RESOURCES BUT THE PLANNING IN

01:36:52.072 --> 01:36:53.641
THE ENGINEERING RESOURCES. TO

01:36:53.707 --> 01:36:54.875
WILL HAVE TO HIT WITH TECHNOLOGY

01:36:54.942 --> 01:36:57.478
WITH TRAINING AND AND AGAIN --

01:36:57.545 --> 01:36:59.046
BY HAVING MORE MORE WORKERS

01:36:59.113 --> 01:37:01.015
TRAINED TO DO THIS -- ONE OF

01:37:01.081 --> 01:37:02.516
THINGS THAT -- WE'RE WE'RE NOT

01:37:02.583 --> 01:37:03.884
KIDDING OURSELVES THIS IS NOT A

01:37:03.951 --> 01:37:05.419
SHORT TERM PROBLEM THIS IS A

01:37:05.486 --> 01:37:06.587
LONG TERM PROBLEM.

01:37:06.654 --> 01:37:08.756
AND SO AS WE CATCH UP I THINK

01:37:08.822 --> 01:37:10.658
THE LABOR WILL COME BECAUSE THIS

01:37:10.724 --> 01:37:12.960
IS I THINK -- SOMETHING WHERE WE

01:37:13.027 --> 01:37:14.261
WILL BE DOING THIS WORK FOR A

01:37:14.328 --> 01:37:17.231
NUMBER OF YEARS AND THESE ARE --

01:37:17.298 --> 01:37:17.998
IT GIVES ARE.

01:37:18.065 --> 01:37:18.799
PLACES WHERE WE NEED HIGHLY

01:37:18.866 --> 01:37:20.568
QUALIFIED TRAINED INDIVIDUALS

01:37:20.634 --> 01:37:22.136
AND AND WE WANT THEM HERE SO I I

01:37:22.203 --> 01:37:23.470
THINK WE'LL WE'LL WE'LL GET THAT

01:37:23.537 --> 01:37:28.242
RESPONSE RIGHT NOW IT IS VERY

01:37:28.309 --> 01:37:32.079
TIGHT -- IN TERMS OF CONVINCING --

01:37:32.146 --> 01:37:33.113
EVERYONE THAT THIS IS THIS IS

01:37:33.180 --> 01:37:34.281
OUR YOUTH ASSIST REALLY IS WHAT

01:37:34.348 --> 01:37:36.383
WE'RE ABOUT NOW THIS IS -- HOW

01:37:36.450 --> 01:37:37.551
WE ARE FOCUSED AS AN

01:37:37.618 --> 01:37:39.453
ORGANIZATION I I CAN TELL YOU IT

01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:41.055
IS FROM THE TOP DOWN OF THIS

01:37:41.121 --> 01:37:41.655
ENTERPRISE?

01:37:41.722 --> 01:37:43.157
THAT WHILE FAR MITIGATION IS OUR

01:37:43.224 --> 01:37:45.326
NUMBER ONE PRIORITY -- WE ARE

01:37:45.392 --> 01:37:47.261
FOCUSED AND MORE MAIN FOCUS ON

01:37:47.328 --> 01:37:47.895
CONTINUING TO CHALLENGE

01:37:47.962 --> 01:37:50.064
OURSELVES AND WE HAVE A SEPARATE

01:37:50.130 --> 01:37:51.966
OFFICE DEDICATED TO JUST THIS

01:37:52.032 --> 01:37:54.668
ISSUE AND JUST THESE.

01:37:54.735 --> 01:37:55.269
SWEET OF THINGS THAT WE'RE

01:37:55.336 --> 01:37:57.438
LOOKING AT TO DO JUST THAT TO

01:37:57.504 --> 01:37:59.173
LOOK AT WHAT'S THE STATE OF THE

01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:00.407
INDUSTRY WAS A STATE OF

01:38:00.474 --> 01:38:01.842
TECHNOLOGY WAS A STATE OF

01:38:01.909 --> 01:38:03.043
SCIENTIFIC THINKING AROUND THIS

01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:04.912
SO -- I THINK WE'VE WE'VE

01:38:04.979 --> 01:38:06.880
DEVOLVED MUSCLE MEMORY HERE AND

01:38:06.947 --> 01:38:07.948
CHALLENGING THE WAY WE THINK

01:38:08.015 --> 01:38:10.317
ABOUT THINGS AND THIS IS A I

01:38:10.384 --> 01:38:12.086
PERSONALLY COMMITTED TO THIS.

01:38:12.152 --> 01:38:14.488
AND THIS IS SOMETHING WE'LL SEE

01:38:14.555 --> 01:38:15.522
OVER TIME IS HOW WE HOW WE

01:38:15.589 --> 01:38:17.124
ACTUALLY DEPLOY OUR OUR

01:38:17.191 --> 01:38:20.694
SOLUTIONS AND CONTINUE TO

01:38:20.761 --> 01:38:26.000
CHALLENGE OURSELVES.

01:38:26.066 --> 01:38:27.301
JUSTICE FOR THAT ADD ON TO THAT --

01:38:27.368 --> 01:38:27.935
JUST IN TERMS OF THE THE LABOR

01:38:28.002 --> 01:38:28.569
ELEMENT YOUR QUESTION ABOUT HOW

01:38:28.636 --> 01:38:30.004
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ATTRACT --

01:38:30.070 --> 01:38:31.805
THE RESOURCES SO WE'VE HAD TO DO

01:38:31.872 --> 01:38:33.774
IT AT A PREMIUM ACOSTA PREMIUM --

01:38:33.841 --> 01:38:37.077
AND AND THAT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE

01:38:37.144 --> 01:38:39.647
OF FOR THE COST PREMIUM IN TERMS.

01:38:39.713 --> 01:38:42.049
SO SO SO SO BE IT IN TERMS OF TO

01:38:42.116 --> 01:38:44.818
TERMS AND CONDITIONS -- FOR THE

01:38:44.885 --> 01:38:46.887
CONTRACTORS RIGHT SO THERE'S A

01:38:46.954 --> 01:38:48.155
HIGHER HIGHER COST.

01:38:48.222 --> 01:38:49.757
OF STRUCTURE IN TERMS OF LABOR

01:38:49.823 --> 01:38:51.925
HOURS AS AN EXAMPLE -- THAT WE

01:38:51.992 --> 01:38:53.961
PUT FORWARD TO BE ABLE TO BRING

01:38:54.028 --> 01:38:55.195
THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND AND

01:38:55.262 --> 01:38:56.430
THE REASON I BROUGHT THAT UP AS

01:38:56.497 --> 01:38:57.865
A BARRIER IS WE'VE REALLY.

01:38:57.931 --> 01:39:00.301
HITTING CALM THE MARKET CAP --

01:39:00.367 --> 01:39:02.202
AND IT'S NOT A SUSTAINABLE WAY

01:39:02.269 --> 01:39:04.371
FOR US TO CONTINUE TO DO THIS IN

01:39:04.438 --> 01:39:05.939
TERMS OF YOU KNOW PAYING

01:39:06.006 --> 01:39:07.441
INDIVIDUALS ARE OUT OF STATE --

01:39:07.508 --> 01:39:08.976
ON A ON AN ESCALATED CALL

01:39:09.043 --> 01:39:10.244
STRUCTURE WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE

01:39:10.311 --> 01:39:11.645
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT RESOURCES

01:39:11.712 --> 01:39:13.414
THAT'S GOING TO BE A CRITICAL

01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:14.481
ASPECT OF WHAT'S NEEDED WITHIN

01:39:14.548 --> 01:39:15.649
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:39:15.716 --> 01:39:16.717
GOING FORWARD SO WE NEED A

01:39:16.784 --> 01:39:18.919
LONGER TERM.

01:39:18.986 --> 01:39:21.655
LABOR RESOURCE -- PROGRAM IN

01:39:21.722 --> 01:39:22.856
TERMS OF APPRENTICESHIP AND I

01:39:22.923 --> 01:39:23.390
THINK THERE'S REALLY AN

01:39:23.457 --> 01:39:25.092
OPPORTUNITY NOT JUST FOR THE

01:39:25.159 --> 01:39:26.360
THREE I'LL USE HERE BUT SOME OF

01:39:26.427 --> 01:39:28.062
THE THE STATE ENTITIES U. S. FOR

01:39:28.128 --> 01:39:30.531
SERVICES OF LEVERAGES THEM FROM.

01:39:30.597 --> 01:39:31.165
OF EDUCATION MATCHING

01:39:31.231 --> 01:39:32.466
PERSPECTIVE SO HOW DO WE REALLY

01:39:32.533 --> 01:39:34.735
GROW -- CALIFORNIA LABOR MARKET

01:39:34.802 --> 01:39:36.170
AS IT PERTAINS TO THE THE

01:39:36.236 --> 01:39:38.339
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT RESOURCES

01:39:38.405 --> 01:39:39.907
IT'S IT'S A REAL ISSUE -- THAT

01:39:39.973 --> 01:39:41.709
WERE CONCERNED ABOUT AND BUT

01:39:41.775 --> 01:39:43.744
REALLY WILLING TO PARTNER TO

01:39:43.811 --> 01:39:47.815
ESTABLISH A LONG TERM.

01:39:47.881 --> 01:39:50.784
SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION

01:39:50.851 --> 01:39:51.085
[inaudible]

01:39:51.151 --> 01:39:52.519
SKINNER CITY.

01:39:52.586 --> 01:39:53.587
THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANT TO

01:39:53.654 --> 01:39:53.854
CONTINUE.

01:39:53.921 --> 01:39:54.988
MS EGGMAN QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

01:39:55.055 --> 01:39:57.224
UNDER GROUNDING -- YOU YOU TALK

01:39:57.291 --> 01:39:59.793
ABOUT COVER CONDUCTORS SICK OF

01:39:59.860 --> 01:40:00.627
BEING A LOT CHEAPER THAN

01:40:00.694 --> 01:40:02.062
UNDERGROUND YOU CAN YOU CAN YOU

01:40:02.129 --> 01:40:04.832
GIVE US A SENSE AS TO WHAT ORDER

01:40:04.898 --> 01:40:06.734
OF A YEAH IT'S PROBABLY A FACTOR

01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:08.802
OF EIGHT SO HE TO WE OUR RULE OF

01:40:08.869 --> 01:40:10.237
THUMB IS UNDER GROUNDING IS

01:40:10.304 --> 01:40:11.438
ROUGHLY THREE MILLION.

01:40:11.505 --> 01:40:13.240
DOLLARS A CIRCUIT MILE -- COVER

01:40:13.307 --> 01:40:16.243
CONDUCTOR IS ROUGHLY FOUR

01:40:16.310 --> 01:40:17.578
HUNDRED FIFTY DEPORTED SEVENTY

01:40:17.644 --> 01:40:18.812
THOUSAND DOLLARS A CIRCUIT MILE

01:40:18.879 --> 01:40:23.817
OKAY AND DO YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY.

01:40:23.884 --> 01:40:24.785
PROGRAMS WHERE.

01:40:24.852 --> 01:40:26.220
YOU WOULD SHARE THE COST WITH

01:40:26.286 --> 01:40:28.655
WITH CITIES IF IF CITIES WERE

01:40:28.722 --> 01:40:31.592
WILLING TO A FOOT FOR FOOT IN

01:40:31.658 --> 01:40:33.293
I'M A PART OF THE BILL THEY THEY

01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:34.328
YOU WOULD

01:40:34.395 --> 01:40:36.463
PARTNER AND PERHAPS PRIORITIZE

01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:38.632
UNDER GROUNDINGS IN COMMUNITIES

01:40:38.699 --> 01:40:40.100
WE HAVE A RULE TWENTY PROGRAMS

01:40:40.167 --> 01:40:42.302
THOSE ARE GENERALLY AND FRANKLY

01:40:42.369 --> 01:40:44.405
FOR AESTHETIC PURPOSES -- IS A

01:40:44.471 --> 01:40:45.839
CONVERSATION WERE WERE WILLING

01:40:45.906 --> 01:40:47.341
TO HAVE A SISTER THERE ISN'T A

01:40:47.408 --> 01:40:49.076
TERRAPIN PLACE FOR US IN IN

01:40:49.143 --> 01:40:51.111
SOCAL EDISON -- TO APPROACH ON A

01:40:51.178 --> 01:40:52.913
GROUNDING AS A RISK MITIGATION

01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:54.782
METHOD IN A COST SHARING

01:40:54.848 --> 01:40:55.249
MECHANISM.

01:40:55.315 --> 01:40:59.486
OKAY AND AND AND SO THAT WOULD --

01:40:59.553 --> 01:41:00.788
TO IN IN TERMS OF THE EXISTING

01:41:00.854 --> 01:41:02.990
PROGRAM FOR STATIC PURPOSES IS

01:41:03.056 --> 01:41:08.729
IS SAID -- TO IT IS IS AT A

01:41:08.796 --> 01:41:10.464
ARRANGEMENT THAT YOU DIRECTLY

01:41:10.531 --> 01:41:12.533
ENTER INTO A CITIES ORDERED A

01:41:12.599 --> 01:41:14.635
DIEGO THROUGH THE CPC TO YEAH IT

01:41:14.701 --> 01:41:17.271
IT'S ROLE -- TWENTY IT'S RULE

01:41:17.337 --> 01:41:18.739
TWENTY EIGHT SO WE HAVE --

01:41:18.806 --> 01:41:19.940
PROGRAMS WHERE CREDITS ARE

01:41:20.007 --> 01:41:21.341
BANKED IN CITIES CAN USE THOSE

01:41:21.408 --> 01:41:23.243
CREDITS -- AND APPLY THEM

01:41:23.310 --> 01:41:26.146
TOWARDS -- TOWARDS UNDER

01:41:26.213 --> 01:41:27.748
GROUNDING EFFORTS OKAY.

01:41:27.815 --> 01:41:29.883
ALL RIGHT PHAM.

01:41:29.950 --> 01:41:32.953
AND THEN I WANTED TO GO MOVE OUT

01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:34.555
I SAID I GOT STARTS ARE NOT TO

01:41:34.621 --> 01:41:35.522
TO NO NO I DON'T BUT I DO I DO I

01:41:35.589 --> 01:41:38.692
GET BACK TO ONE OF THE COST IS

01:41:38.759 --> 01:41:40.060
JUST ONE OF THE DIMENSIONS.

01:41:40.127 --> 01:41:40.861
WITH THE TIME TO DEPLOY HE IS A

01:41:40.928 --> 01:41:43.363
KEY -- ONE AND ALSO THE AMOUNT

01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:44.665
OF ADDITIONAL MILES BUT REALLY

01:41:44.731 --> 01:41:46.300
TIME TO DEPLOY WANT ONE OF THESE

01:41:46.366 --> 01:41:47.835
ARE VERY FOCUSED ON IS REDUCING

01:41:47.901 --> 01:41:49.436
THE RISK AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN SO

01:41:49.503 --> 01:41:51.038
I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE KEY

01:41:51.104 --> 01:41:52.339
ELEMENTS OF THE OF THE PROGRAM.

01:41:52.406 --> 01:41:54.441
OF COURSE SO I WENT WHEN YOU'RE

01:41:54.508 --> 01:41:56.810
TALKING ABOUT TARGETING TARGETED

01:41:56.877 --> 01:41:57.444
UNDER GROUNDING IN THE YEAR WE

01:41:57.511 --> 01:41:58.345
ARE YOU HEY HOW ARE YOU

01:41:58.412 --> 01:42:00.214
TARGETING IT WOULD BE WHERE WE

01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:02.549
WOULD IDENTIFY -- GREATER LEVELS

01:42:02.616 --> 01:42:05.819
OF REST THAT -- CAN BE DONE --

01:42:05.886 --> 01:42:06.587
IN A YOU KNOW IT'S AN

01:42:06.653 --> 01:42:07.955
EXPEDITIOUS WAY SO IT WILL BE

01:42:08.021 --> 01:42:09.823
PART OF THE PORTFOLIO GOING

01:42:09.890 --> 01:42:14.161
FORWARD -- AND IT IT'S IT'S IN

01:42:14.228 --> 01:42:16.630
THE PROGRAM.

01:42:16.697 --> 01:42:16.930
ALL RIGHT.

01:42:16.997 --> 01:42:19.800
THUMB AND THEN I WANTED TO A OF

01:42:19.867 --> 01:42:22.302
TURN TO I I DON'T KNOW IF -- THE

01:42:22.369 --> 01:42:26.306
THE PANELISTS RECEIVED -- TO THE

01:42:26.373 --> 01:42:28.108
MEMO THAT WE RECEIVED AS AS PART

01:42:28.175 --> 01:42:29.810
OF THIS INFORMATION HEARING BUT

01:42:29.877 --> 01:42:33.514
IT LOOKS LIKE THE THE THEIR PC

01:42:33.580 --> 01:42:36.250
IS GOING TO BE -- ASKING THE I.

01:42:36.316 --> 01:42:38.018
O. U.'S FOR METRICS THAT ARE

01:42:38.085 --> 01:42:39.653
FOCUSING NOT ON THE NUMBER OF

01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:41.555
ACTIONS TAKEN BUT INSTEAD ON HOW

01:42:41.622 --> 01:42:43.557
THOSE ACTIONS MEASURABLY REDUCE

01:42:43.624 --> 01:42:44.958
THE RISK OF CATASTROPHIC

01:42:45.025 --> 01:42:49.997
WILDFIRE -- I I I IMAGINE GIVEN

01:42:50.063 --> 01:42:50.631
THAT.

01:42:50.697 --> 01:42:51.899
LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A JULY

01:42:51.965 --> 01:42:52.933
DEADLINE THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.134
THAT BUT TO CAN YOU CAN YOU GIVE

01:42:54.201 --> 01:42:55.469
US A PREVIEW AS TO WHAT SOME OF

01:42:55.536 --> 01:42:57.771
THOSE -- THOSE -- THEY THE

01:42:57.838 --> 01:42:59.373
GENERAL PARAMETERS OF THOSE

01:42:59.439 --> 01:43:01.575
METRICS WOULD LOOK LIKE.

01:43:01.642 --> 01:43:02.743
SURE I CAN START OFF IN THE NINE

01:43:02.809 --> 01:43:04.211
BUT MY COLLEAGUES TO A CHIME IN --

01:43:04.278 --> 01:43:05.445
SO SO WE'RE LOOKING AT BOTH

01:43:05.512 --> 01:43:07.948
OUTCOME BASED METRICS -- REALLY

01:43:08.015 --> 01:43:10.050
FROM A A LEADING AND A LAGGING --

01:43:10.117 --> 01:43:12.686
PERSPECTIVE SOAP UP EXAMPLE OF A

01:43:12.753 --> 01:43:15.722
LAGGING INDICATOR -- IS A FIRE

01:43:15.789 --> 01:43:17.691
IGNITION -- OF OF A SMALL SIZE A

01:43:17.758 --> 01:43:21.128
AS AN EXAMPLE AND WE OF

01:43:21.194 --> 01:43:22.162
IDENTIFIES AS MR DEL CASTILLO

01:43:22.229 --> 01:43:24.464
STATED BEFORE SO ANY IGNITION --

01:43:24.531 --> 01:43:26.166
WE CHARACTERIZE WHAT IS THE

01:43:26.233 --> 01:43:27.367
ACTUAL COST OF THAT IGNITION SO

01:43:27.434 --> 01:43:28.535
WAS THAT.

01:43:28.602 --> 01:43:32.339
A RESULT OF EQUIPMENT ISSUE --

01:43:32.406 --> 01:43:33.473
WAS THAT A RESULT OF VEGETATION

01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:34.908
VEGETATION POTENTIALLY COMING IN

01:43:34.975 --> 01:43:37.844
CONTACT WITH A BARE WIRE THE

01:43:37.911 --> 01:43:39.012
BECAUSE THE OUR COURSE BARK SO.

01:43:39.079 --> 01:43:41.415
LOOKING AT THE VARIOUS IGNITION

01:43:41.481 --> 01:43:44.017
DRIVERS THAT RESULT IN THE

01:43:44.084 --> 01:43:45.452
POTENTIAL FAR ADDITION TO THAT'S

01:43:45.519 --> 01:43:47.154
MORE OF A LAGGING INDICATOR.

01:43:47.220 --> 01:43:49.256
THE COROLLARY TO THAT FOR A

01:43:49.323 --> 01:43:51.491
LEADING INDICATOR ISRAELI

01:43:51.558 --> 01:43:53.493
OUTAGES -- THAT ARE CAUSED BY

01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:55.896
THOSE SAME TYPES OF DRIVERS SO

01:43:55.963 --> 01:43:57.764
AS WE LOOK AT THE EFFECTIVENESS

01:43:57.831 --> 01:43:58.966
OF THE ENHANCE VEGETATION

01:43:59.032 --> 01:44:00.601
MANAGEMENT PROGRAM OR THE

01:44:00.667 --> 01:44:02.336
INSPECTION PROCESS OR THE SYSTEM

01:44:02.402 --> 01:44:03.870
HARDENING THE REALLY GEARED

01:44:03.937 --> 01:44:05.439
TOWARDS REDUCE SAYING.

01:44:05.505 --> 01:44:07.174
NOT ONLY THE NUMBER OF IGNITION

01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:08.709
CAUSED BY VEGETATION OR

01:44:08.775 --> 01:44:10.711
EQUIPMENT DRIVEN ISSUES BUT ALSO

01:44:10.777 --> 01:44:13.080
OUTAGES OUTAGES IS WHERE WE MAY

01:44:13.146 --> 01:44:16.683
HAVE -- A IMPACT EITHER -- OF

01:44:16.750 --> 01:44:18.652
VEGETATION -- COMING IN CONTACT

01:44:18.719 --> 01:44:20.687
WITH A LINE THAT CREATES WHAT'S

01:44:20.754 --> 01:44:22.289
CALLED A FAULT -- AND EITHER

01:44:22.356 --> 01:44:24.424
THERE'S A MOMENTARY OR SUSTAINED

01:44:24.491 --> 01:44:25.392
OUT AGE.

01:44:25.459 --> 01:44:27.260
WHERE IT IMPACTS THE CIRCUIT AND

01:44:27.327 --> 01:44:28.629
THE CIRCUIT BASICALLY OPENS

01:44:28.695 --> 01:44:29.796
MEETING THAT THERE'S NO

01:44:29.863 --> 01:44:30.998
ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH IT

01:44:31.064 --> 01:44:33.133
ANYMORE -- AND REALLY WE ARE

01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:35.068
USING A THINKING ABOUT THE OUR

01:44:35.135 --> 01:44:38.005
AGE AS THE LEADING INDICATOR --

01:44:38.071 --> 01:44:40.307
TO THE LAGGING INDICATOR A FAR

01:44:40.374 --> 01:44:41.675
DISTANCE A TRACKING BOTH OF

01:44:41.742 --> 01:44:43.644
THOSE AND AS WE CONTINUE TO

01:44:43.710 --> 01:44:44.511
IMPLEMENT THE RISK REDUCTION

01:44:44.578 --> 01:44:52.686
MEASURES.

01:44:52.753 --> 01:44:53.854
NOW IS SEEING A DECLINE IN THE

01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:55.222
OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE IF YOU

01:44:55.288 --> 01:44:55.989
WANT TO CALL IT OF THOSE

01:44:56.056 --> 01:44:57.290
RESPECTIVE VEGETATION OR

01:44:57.357 --> 01:45:00.160
EQUIPMENT COSTS OUTRAGEOUS.

01:45:00.227 --> 01:45:01.728
WHERE WERE IN A SIMILAR --

01:45:01.795 --> 01:45:02.362
APPROACHING US IN A SIMILAR WAY

01:45:02.429 --> 01:45:03.230
I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IN

01:45:03.296 --> 01:45:04.064
SOME OF THE UC OUTCOME BASED

01:45:04.131 --> 01:45:05.432
EARLY ON IT IS THE AOUNT OF

01:45:05.499 --> 01:45:06.199
VOLATILITY IS GOING TO BE

01:45:06.266 --> 01:45:07.567
ASSOCIATED WITH THEM GIVEN THE

01:45:07.634 --> 01:45:08.568
SIZE OF OUR SYSTEM.

01:45:08.635 --> 01:45:10.037
WOW QUICKLY YOU'LL SEE SOME OF

01:45:10.103 --> 01:45:11.304
THESE BUT THEY THEY THEY WILL

01:45:11.371 --> 01:45:13.607
BECOME A PART OF HOW WE'RE WE'RE

01:45:13.674 --> 01:45:14.841
LOOKING AT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

01:45:14.908 --> 01:45:17.277
OUR PROGRAMS OVERALL -- AND AND

01:45:17.344 --> 01:45:18.578
WE'RE FRANKLY APPROACHING THIS

01:45:18.645 --> 01:45:19.946
THE SAME WAY THAT PROBABLY THE

01:45:20.013 --> 01:45:21.481
ONLY THING I WOULD ADD IS --

01:45:21.548 --> 01:45:23.350
WHERE WE ARE NOW IS REGARDLESS

01:45:23.417 --> 01:45:25.786
OF LOCATION OF OF -- OF A

01:45:25.852 --> 01:45:27.254
CIRCUIT PROBLEM WE'RE WE'RE

01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:29.389
LOOKING AT OUR SYSTEM -- NOT

01:45:29.456 --> 01:45:31.024
JUST IN HIGH FIRE IS SCARY BUT

01:45:31.091 --> 01:45:32.125
ON THE NON HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS --

01:45:32.192 --> 01:45:34.594
BECAUSE THINGS THAT OCCUR ON

01:45:34.661 --> 01:45:35.729
SOMETHING ABOUT HOW THE SYSTEM

01:45:35.796 --> 01:45:36.963
OVERALL CAN OPERATE.

01:45:37.030 --> 01:45:38.965
SO IF WE HAVE AN EVENT --

01:45:39.032 --> 01:45:40.734
QUALITY -- MYLAR BALLOON COMES

01:45:40.801 --> 01:45:42.069
IN CONTACT WITH THE CIRCUIT IN A

01:45:42.135 --> 01:45:44.571
NON HIGH FOR A RISK AREA -- WILL

01:45:44.638 --> 01:45:45.872
EVALUATE THAT IT MAY BE THE KEY --

01:45:45.939 --> 01:45:47.941
CAUSES EVIDENT OR SELF EVIDENT

01:45:48.008 --> 01:45:49.076
WHEN YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED BUT

01:45:49.142 --> 01:45:50.243
IT WILL TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT

01:45:50.310 --> 01:45:51.044
PERHAPS WE SHOULD BE DOING

01:45:51.111 --> 01:45:52.179
DIFFERENTLY.

01:45:52.245 --> 01:45:53.814
IN OTHER SPACES HI FIRE RISK

01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:55.849
AREAS IN TERMS OF MITIGATION

01:45:55.916 --> 01:45:56.450
EFFORTS IN THE CASE WHERE IT

01:45:56.516 --> 01:45:58.385
DOES MAKE A BIGGER DIFFERENCE IF

01:45:58.452 --> 01:45:59.853
WE HAVE AN EVENT THAT HAPPENED

01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:00.353
SO.

01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:01.755
WE'RE ESSENTIALLY GOING OUT AND

01:46:01.822 --> 01:46:02.355
DOING ANALYSES OF ALL OF OUR

01:46:02.422 --> 01:46:04.057
FAULTS -- AND WE'RE GOING TO

01:46:04.124 --> 01:46:06.259
DRESS THOSE IN THE PROGRAMS AND

01:46:06.326 --> 01:46:12.833
STANDARDS WE PUT IN PLACE FOR

01:46:12.899 --> 01:46:14.735
THE HIGHER FIRE RISK AREAS.

01:46:14.801 --> 01:46:16.002
YES IN FROM OUR STANDPOINT WERE

01:46:16.069 --> 01:46:17.571
LINING CLOSELY I'D SECOND EVERY

01:46:17.637 --> 01:46:18.472
EVERYTHING WE HEARD AND PER THE

01:46:18.538 --> 01:46:19.506
PROPOSED -- DECISION ON THE WILD

01:46:19.573 --> 01:46:20.173
FIRE MITIGATION PLAN WE WILL ALL

01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:21.708
BE ALIGNING EVEN MORE CLOSELY

01:46:21.775 --> 01:46:22.876
MOVING FORWARD.

01:46:22.943 --> 01:46:25.412
WE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON THE

01:46:25.479 --> 01:46:26.880
PERFORMANCE OF OUR PROJECTS

01:46:26.947 --> 01:46:28.548
BECAUSE WHEN WE START LOOKING AT

01:46:28.615 --> 01:46:30.117
THINGS LIKE NUMBER OF IGNITIONS

01:46:30.183 --> 01:46:32.552
THE REALITY IS -- DROUGHT HAS A

01:46:32.619 --> 01:46:34.121
MAJOR IMPACT A NUMBER OF

01:46:34.187 --> 01:46:35.255
IGNITIONS ACROSS THE STATE OF

01:46:35.322 --> 01:46:36.656
CALIFORNIA WHEN YOU LOOK AT

01:46:36.723 --> 01:46:37.858
THINGS LIKE WIRES DOWN.

01:46:37.924 --> 01:46:39.793
THE SEVERITY OF WINTER STORMS

01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:41.628
HAS MAJOR IMPACTS OF SOME OF

01:46:41.695 --> 01:46:42.696
THESE THINGS WHAT WE HAVE TO

01:46:42.763 --> 01:46:45.265
NORMALIZE THEM AND FIND WAYS. TO

01:46:45.332 --> 01:46:46.199
TO MAKE IT SO THAT THEY DON'T

01:46:46.266 --> 01:46:47.734
SKEW ALL THE INFORMATION BUT

01:46:47.801 --> 01:46:49.870
THAT BEING SAID WILL BE WORKING

01:46:49.936 --> 01:46:51.972
TOGETHER ON THIS MOVING FORWARD.

01:46:52.038 --> 01:46:52.272
ALL RIGHT.

01:46:52.339 --> 01:46:57.177
AND MY MY LAST QUESTION -- IS --

01:46:57.244 --> 01:46:59.212
WITH THIS MEMO THAT DISCUSSES

01:46:59.279 --> 01:47:02.115
THAT RAISES THE ISSUE OF FOR

01:47:02.182 --> 01:47:04.284
WHETHER THE PC HAS THE THE

01:47:04.351 --> 01:47:08.155
CAPACITY. TO TO BE AN ADEQUATE --

01:47:08.221 --> 01:47:10.223
SAFETY REGULATOR IN ADDITION TO

01:47:10.290 --> 01:47:11.224
ALL OF THEIR OTHER

01:47:11.291 --> 01:47:14.728
RESPONSIBILITIES AND I I LIKE

01:47:14.795 --> 01:47:15.929
AND KNOW IT.

01:47:15.996 --> 01:47:17.397
MAYBE AWKWARD TO A TO TO

01:47:17.464 --> 01:47:20.600
EVALUATE THE EVALUATOR -- OR BUT

01:47:20.667 --> 01:47:22.469
I WAS WONDERING IF -- IF YOU YOU

01:47:22.536 --> 01:47:24.471
CAN OFFER ANY.

01:47:24.538 --> 01:47:26.640
ANY THOUGHTS AS TO WHETHER THE

01:47:26.706 --> 01:47:30.710
PC IS UP -- TO THE IT HAS IT HAS

01:47:30.777 --> 01:47:36.683
THE NECESSARY -- CAPACITY. TO TO

01:47:36.750 --> 01:47:37.517
TO TO TO EVALUATE INTO OF

01:47:37.584 --> 01:47:40.987
OVERSEE THE THE THE THE THE

01:47:41.054 --> 01:47:42.622
WHILE FAR SAFETY.

01:47:42.689 --> 01:47:44.825
MEASURES THAT THE I. O. USER

01:47:44.891 --> 01:47:46.726
TAKING.

01:47:46.793 --> 01:47:47.360
AND IF I POOR WILL WELCOME YOUR

01:47:47.427 --> 01:47:49.362
RESPONSE TO THIS QUESTION BUT WE

01:47:49.429 --> 01:47:50.597
DO HAVE ANOTHER PANEL THAT

01:47:50.664 --> 01:47:51.331
SQUARE AUDITOR'S NOW THAT'S A

01:47:51.398 --> 01:47:54.067
QUICK. TO FOCUS ON OVERSIGHT SO.

01:47:54.134 --> 01:47:55.769
IF YOU DO HAVE A RESPONSE WHICH

01:47:55.836 --> 01:47:58.104
I DO WELCOME -- JUST MAKE IT A

01:47:58.171 --> 01:48:00.140
QUICK RESPONSE SO THAT WE CAN

01:48:00.207 --> 01:48:02.876
HELLO THE NEXT BATTLE TO GET.

01:48:02.943 --> 01:48:03.543
TWO MORE INTO THE WEEDS ON IT IF

01:48:03.610 --> 01:48:04.444
YOU.

01:48:04.511 --> 01:48:06.379
I I WOULD JUST SAY -- I I THINK

01:48:06.446 --> 01:48:09.149
THIS IS GOING TO BE A

01:48:09.216 --> 01:48:11.151
COLLABORATIVE PROCESS ACROSS THE

01:48:11.218 --> 01:48:13.687
BOARD -- I I THINK YOU KNOW THE

01:48:13.753 --> 01:48:14.654
THE COMMISSION.

01:48:14.721 --> 01:48:16.156
HAS A RESOURCES AND IS THE REAL

01:48:16.223 --> 01:48:17.991
QUESTION IS JUST HOW WE PARTNER

01:48:18.058 --> 01:48:20.994
IS -- TO TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS

01:48:21.061 --> 01:48:22.863
I THINK IT'S WE WE NEED GUIDANCE

01:48:22.929 --> 01:48:24.598
AND STRUCTURE AROUND WHAT WE'RE

01:48:24.664 --> 01:48:26.566
DOING CAN BE VERY HELPFUL.

01:48:26.633 --> 01:48:28.535
WE HAVE THAT IS -- ENTERPRISES

01:48:28.602 --> 01:48:30.136
NOT JUST WITH OURSELVES BUT ALSO

01:48:30.203 --> 01:48:31.805
OUTSIDE OF HIS COLLABORATED ON

01:48:31.872 --> 01:48:32.973
TRYING TO FIND THE BEST

01:48:33.039 --> 01:48:34.608
SOLUTIONS THAT WE CAN TO

01:48:34.674 --> 01:48:36.877
MITIGATE WILDFIRE RISK -- WE WE

01:48:36.943 --> 01:48:37.811
DON'T WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO

01:48:37.878 --> 01:48:40.413
PARTNERING WITH WITH AGENCIES

01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:43.416
AND THE CBC AND ARE GOVERNED

01:48:43.483 --> 01:48:45.385
PARTNERS AT CAL -- AWESOME MERCY

01:48:45.452 --> 01:48:46.620
SERVICES CAL FIRE AND OTHERS

01:48:46.686 --> 01:48:47.888
BECAUSE I DO THINK THIS IS NOT

01:48:47.954 --> 01:48:49.923
SOMETHING THAT -- ANYONE

01:48:49.990 --> 01:48:52.525
ENTERPRISE OR AGENCY REALLY --

01:48:52.592 --> 01:48:54.094
CAN ADDRESS I THINK THIS IS

01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:55.462
GOING TO TAKE.

01:48:55.528 --> 01:48:57.697
A LOT OF RESOURCES AND A LOT OF

01:48:57.764 --> 01:48:59.065
AGENCIES A LOT OF DIFFERENT --

01:48:59.132 --> 01:49:00.767
IMPORTS ACROSS THE THE

01:49:00.834 --> 01:49:02.469
REGULATORY LEGISLATIVE COMPLEX

01:49:02.535 --> 01:49:04.237
AS WELL AS ENTITIES LIKE

01:49:04.304 --> 01:49:05.472
OURSELVES WHO WERE OR BE

01:49:05.538 --> 01:49:06.873
REGULATED AND WE WE HAVE PART OF

01:49:06.940 --> 01:49:07.774
THE SOLUTION.

01:49:07.841 --> 01:49:09.943
SO IT'S IT'S GOING TO BE A

01:49:10.010 --> 01:49:11.611
COLLABORATIVE EFFORT SO I'D

01:49:11.678 --> 01:49:12.746
RATHER NOT ADDRESS THAT DUDE'S

01:49:12.812 --> 01:49:13.980
GOT THE CAPABILITY BECAUSE I I I

01:49:14.047 --> 01:49:15.982
REALLY THINK -- YOU COULD

01:49:16.049 --> 01:49:17.984
STRUCTURE AT HOWEVER YOU NEEDED

01:49:18.051 --> 01:49:24.791
TO WHATEVER AGENCIES HAVE THE

01:49:24.858 --> 01:49:26.126
CAPABILITY [inaudible]

01:49:26.192 --> 01:49:28.361
THANK YOU.

01:49:28.428 --> 01:49:29.796
THE CITY IS CLICK -- I'M SORRY

01:49:29.863 --> 01:49:30.964
WE HAVE YEAH ONE MORE QUESTION

01:49:31.031 --> 01:49:32.599
THE FREE IS THERE ANYONE ELSE ON

01:49:32.666 --> 01:49:33.199
THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE I WOULD

01:49:33.266 --> 01:49:34.734
LIKE.

01:49:34.801 --> 01:49:37.938
TO OKAY OKAY DOCTOR QUIRK -- SO

01:49:38.004 --> 01:49:38.972
YOU'RE.

01:49:39.039 --> 01:49:39.639
YOUR HEDGED IN AND HOW FAST YOU

01:49:39.706 --> 01:49:40.807
CAN DO THIS BY A NUMBER OF

01:49:40.874 --> 01:49:41.574
FACTORS.

01:49:41.641 --> 01:49:42.142
A ONE OF THEM OF COURSE IS

01:49:42.208 --> 01:49:44.210
REACHING OUT TO THE PUBLIC ON

01:49:44.277 --> 01:49:46.680
TREES AND POWER -- SHUT OFFS I

01:49:46.746 --> 01:49:49.215
WOULD JUST STRESS THAT YOU TAKE

01:49:49.282 --> 01:49:51.451
SAFETY IS THE NUMBER ONE CONCERN

01:49:51.518 --> 01:49:53.153
TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU CAN.

01:49:53.219 --> 01:49:55.388
REACH OUT THAT'S WONDERFUL BUT

01:49:55.455 --> 01:49:56.690
PLEASE CUT THE TREES IN MY

01:49:56.756 --> 01:49:58.925
NEIGHBORHOOD IF YOU HAVE TO DO

01:49:58.992 --> 01:50:01.061
IT RIGHT AWAY AND TURN OFF THE

01:50:01.127 --> 01:50:02.662
POWER WHEN YOU NEED TO I'LL I'LL

01:50:02.729 --> 01:50:03.997
SURVIVE.

01:50:04.064 --> 01:50:06.132
YOU MAY NEED -- PROTECTION FROM

01:50:06.199 --> 01:50:09.769
SUITS IF THAT'S AN ISSUE YOU

01:50:09.836 --> 01:50:11.004
NEED TO BRING THAT TO US.

01:50:11.071 --> 01:50:12.172
OUR BECAUSE PEOPLE MAY SUE OVER

01:50:12.238 --> 01:50:14.507
TREES CUT OR POWER BEING SHUT

01:50:14.574 --> 01:50:16.443
OFF AND LOSSES OF ONE TYPE OR

01:50:16.509 --> 01:50:17.277
ANOTHER.

01:50:17.344 --> 01:50:19.112
AND YOU ALREADY ADDRESSED THE

01:50:19.179 --> 01:50:20.947
SAFETY CONCERNS OVER SHUTTING

01:50:21.014 --> 01:50:23.049
OFF POWER WHICH IS ONE REASON IT

01:50:23.116 --> 01:50:26.186
HASN'T BEEN ROUTINE BEFORE THIS --

01:50:26.252 --> 01:50:28.455
YOU'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT COST

01:50:28.521 --> 01:50:30.190
VERSUS SAFETY.

01:50:30.256 --> 01:50:32.425
WE ONLY HAVE TO AVOID ONE OR TWO

01:50:32.492 --> 01:50:34.661
FIRES EVERY DECADE OF THAT SORT

01:50:34.728 --> 01:50:37.263
OF CATASTROPHIC TYPE WE'VE HAD.

01:50:37.330 --> 01:50:39.065
TO MAKE IT WORTH WHILE TO MAYBE

01:50:39.132 --> 01:50:43.169
DO UNDER GROUNDING VERSUS -- I

01:50:43.236 --> 01:50:45.705
WORKING ON THE CONDUCTORS.

01:50:45.772 --> 01:50:47.107
SO.

01:50:47.173 --> 01:50:48.675
I THINK SOMEBODY SHOULD.

01:50:48.742 --> 01:50:50.477
SEE IF THERE'S A REAL DIFFERENCE

01:50:50.543 --> 01:50:51.811
BETWEEN UNDER GROUNDING.

01:50:51.878 --> 01:50:55.382
AND MAKING THE WIRE SAY -- FOR

01:50:55.448 --> 01:50:57.217
WITH THE SYSTEM SUCH AS CUTTING

01:50:57.283 --> 01:50:58.852
OFF THE POWER WHEN THE LINE

01:50:58.918 --> 01:51:01.254
BREAKS IT CETERA WHAT'S THE COST

01:51:01.321 --> 01:51:03.056
OF THAT FIRST IS THE COST OF

01:51:03.123 --> 01:51:04.524
UNDERGROUND IN AND BY THE WAY ON

01:51:04.591 --> 01:51:05.992
THE GROUND IN THIS YOU MENTIONED

01:51:06.059 --> 01:51:07.594
ALSO MEANS A LOT MORE

01:51:07.660 --> 01:51:08.695
MAINTENANCE.

01:51:08.762 --> 01:51:09.863
BUT IF WE COULD SEE WHAT WHAT

01:51:09.929 --> 01:51:12.332
THOSE COSTS ARE AND LOOK AT THEM

01:51:12.399 --> 01:51:13.433
SIDE BY SIDE.

01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:14.834
AND DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT IT

01:51:14.901 --> 01:51:17.203
SAVES A CATASTROPHIC FIRE EVERY

01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:19.706
DECADE OR TWO IT MIGHT BE WORTH

01:51:19.773 --> 01:51:21.441
IT AND I'M JUST SAYING PLEASE DO

01:51:21.508 --> 01:51:23.610
NOT RULE THAT OUT AND PLEASE

01:51:23.676 --> 01:51:25.345
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT.

01:51:25.412 --> 01:51:26.980
UP FINALLY YOU MENTIONED THE

01:51:27.047 --> 01:51:30.383
NUMBER OF THINGS THAT PREVENT

01:51:30.450 --> 01:51:33.553
YOU FROM -- MAKING PROGRESS AS

01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:35.055
FAST AS YOU'D LIKE SHORTNESS OF

01:51:35.121 --> 01:51:36.723
SHORTNESS OF LABOR.

01:51:36.790 --> 01:51:37.690
AND THEIR ALTHOUGH YOU'RE

01:51:37.757 --> 01:51:39.526
BRINGING IN TRAIN PEOPLE FROM

01:51:39.592 --> 01:51:41.294
OUT OF STATE.

01:51:41.361 --> 01:51:41.995
WE HAD TO HAVE A LOT OF

01:51:42.062 --> 01:51:44.130
UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE AND YOU'VE

01:51:44.197 --> 01:51:45.965
TALKED ABOUT -- HAVING

01:51:46.032 --> 01:51:47.200
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS AND SUCH

01:51:47.267 --> 01:51:49.035
TO DO THE TRAINING TO THE EXTENT

01:51:49.102 --> 01:51:50.203
YOU CAN DO THAT.

01:51:50.270 --> 01:51:50.970
I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE

01:51:51.037 --> 01:51:52.839
BECAUSE WE DO HAVE AREAS WITH

01:51:52.906 --> 01:51:54.374
VERY HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT.

01:51:54.441 --> 01:51:55.575
AND WE WOULD HOPE THAT THOSE

01:51:55.642 --> 01:51:59.212
FOLKS WOULD BE ABLE -- TO DO

01:51:59.279 --> 01:52:00.547
THAT WORK.

01:52:00.613 --> 01:52:01.214
THEN FINALLY I'M JUST TRYING TO

01:52:01.281 --> 01:52:03.716
GET AN IDEA OF WHAT'S REALLY

01:52:03.783 --> 01:52:05.985
SLOWING YOU DOWN -- SO YOU

01:52:06.052 --> 01:52:07.620
MENTIONED THERE'S NO TERRA FOR

01:52:07.687 --> 01:52:09.222
UNDERGROUND IN WHICH FOR PEOPLE

01:52:09.289 --> 01:52:11.091
ME FOR THE FOR NORMAL PEOPLE

01:52:11.157 --> 01:52:12.826
THAT MEANS YOU HAVE NO SOURCES

01:52:12.892 --> 01:52:13.860
OF FUNDING.

01:52:13.927 --> 01:52:15.929
THAT WOULD BE AN ISSUE THAT WE

01:52:15.995 --> 01:52:17.730
GO THROUGH THE C. P. U. C..

01:52:17.797 --> 01:52:20.100
V. R. CHAIR OF THE P. YOU SEE

01:52:20.166 --> 01:52:22.235
WHEN HE'S BEEN HERE HAS SAID

01:52:22.302 --> 01:52:24.370
THEY HAVE TOO MANY THINGS TO DO

01:52:24.437 --> 01:52:26.473
ALREADY -- HE'S TALKED ABOUT

01:52:26.539 --> 01:52:27.807
GETTING RID OF IN THIS IS

01:52:27.874 --> 01:52:29.242
PROBABLY SOMETHING WE SHOULD

01:52:29.309 --> 01:52:30.343
LOOK AT TOGETHER WITH THE

01:52:30.410 --> 01:52:32.912
PRESIDENT THE C. P. U. C. AS I

01:52:32.979 --> 01:52:35.515
LOOK OVER TO THE CHAIR HERE --

01:52:35.582 --> 01:52:37.150
HE'S TALKED ABOUT MOVING TRUCK

01:52:37.217 --> 01:52:40.019
BEING AND OTHER SUCH AREAS OUT

01:52:40.086 --> 01:52:41.254
OF THE C. P. U. C.. FOR WHICH

01:52:41.321 --> 01:52:42.422
THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF

01:52:42.489 --> 01:52:44.290
EXPERTISE IN TRYING TO LIMIT

01:52:44.357 --> 01:52:47.060
WHAT THEY CAN LOOK AT AND I

01:52:47.127 --> 01:52:47.694
THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD

01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:48.394
BE DOING.

01:52:48.461 --> 01:52:49.629
BUT THEN WHAT MY REAL QUESTION

01:52:49.696 --> 01:52:51.698
DEALS WITH WHAT REALLY IS

01:52:51.764 --> 01:52:54.033
SLOWING YOU DOWN IS IT A LACK OF

01:52:54.100 --> 01:52:55.935
CAPITAL OF MONEY.

01:52:56.002 --> 01:52:58.438

A PARTICULAR WAY WHAT REALLY IS --

01:53:11.084 --> 01:53:14.320
THE PROBLEM WITH THE IN TERMS OF

01:53:14.387 --> 01:53:16.756
NOT BEING ABLE TO GO AS FAST AS

THE COMMENTS ON THE AND THE

01:53:25.031 --> 01:53:26.332
QUESTION FROM FROM MY

01:53:26.399 --> 01:53:28.401
PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S

01:53:28.468 --> 01:53:30.069
BEEN THE OTHER QUALIFIED

01:53:30.136 --> 01:53:31.404
WORKFORCE.

01:53:31.471 --> 01:53:33.439
THAT THAT'S ONE KEY ELEMENT -- A

01:53:33.506 --> 01:53:35.308
IN SPECIFICALLY AROUND THE

01:53:35.375 --> 01:53:36.843
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PIECE SAYS.

THE END OF LAST YEAR.

01:53:40.446 --> 01:53:45.885
WE PRETTY MUCH OF WERE OFFERING.

01:53:45.952 --> 01:53:47.787
KIND OF A HOURLY RATE RIGHT AT

01:53:47.854 --> 01:53:48.588
WHAT TIME AND PUT AND IT'S IT'S

01:53:48.655 --> 01:53:49.422
CALLED THE HIGHEST RATE POSSIBLE

01:53:49.489 --> 01:53:49.956

01:53:50.023 --> 01:53:50.823
MANAGEMENT.

01:53:50.890 --> 01:53:52.392
OF SPACE AND WHAT WE WERE

01:53:52.458 --> 01:53:54.427
FINDING IS THAT THERE'S KIND OF

01:53:54.494 --> 01:53:55.228
THAT LIMITATION ON THE

01:53:55.295 --> 01:53:56.829
QUALIFICATION OF THE INDIVIDUALS

01:53:56.896 --> 01:53:58.998
BECAUSE THAT THE WARRICK --

01:53:59.065 --> 01:54:00.934
ITSELF IS ONE OF THE HIGHLY

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.703
HAZARDOUS TASKS THAT'S DONE

01:54:03.770 --> 01:54:05.605
WITHIN THE NATION RIGHT NOW WE

01:54:05.672 --> 01:54:06.406
LOOK AT LOGGING.

01:54:06.472 --> 01:54:07.540
AND NOW WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:54:07.607 --> 01:54:09.108
TRIMMING IN AND AROUND --

01:54:09.175 --> 01:54:11.244
ENERGIZED ELECTRICAL LINES IT'S

01:54:11.311 --> 01:54:12.912
ONE OF THE HIGHEST HAZARDOUS

01:54:12.979 --> 01:54:15.048
TASSEL REQUIRES A TRAINED

01:54:15.114 --> 01:54:16.816
PROFESSIONAL AN INDIVIDUAL AND

01:54:16.883 --> 01:54:18.151
WHAT WE WERE IDENTIFYING.

01:54:18.218 --> 01:54:19.352
IS OVER TIME AS WE WERE

01:54:19.419 --> 01:54:21.854
CONTINUING TO OFFER INCENTIVES

01:54:21.921 --> 01:54:22.355
TO BE ABLE TO BRING THE

01:54:22.422 --> 01:54:24.023
RESOURCES OF EVER GETTING

01:54:24.090 --> 01:54:25.158
RESOURCES THAT WERE NOT

01:54:25.225 --> 01:54:26.593
QUALIFIED TO BE ABLE TO DO THE

01:54:26.659 --> 01:54:27.827
WORK AS AS WE WERE DOING THE

01:54:27.894 --> 01:54:30.597
SAFETY OBSERVATION SO THERE'S

01:54:30.663 --> 01:54:32.098
KIND OF THAT -- BUREAU OF FINITE

01:54:32.165 --> 01:54:34.767

QUALIFIED PERSONNEL SO THAT'S

01:54:36.703 --> 01:54:40.740
ONE ONE DIMENSION.

01:54:40.807 --> 01:54:42.342
THE OTHER DIMENSION IS -- IN

01:54:42.408 --> 01:54:42.942
THIS IS NOT WITH ALL OF THE

01:54:43.009 --> 01:54:43.576

ENDANGERED SPECIES -- SO THOSE

01:54:55.655 --> 01:54:56.623
ARE SOME OF THE OTHER ELEMENTS

01:54:56.689 --> 01:54:58.358

WE'RE DOING AND THEY'RE REALLY

01:55:06.165 --> 01:55:07.900
STEPPING UP TO THE PLATE IN

01:55:07.967 --> 01:55:09.902
TERMS OF DEVELOPING -- HABITAT

01:55:09.969 --> 01:55:11.904
CONSERVATION PLANS THAT ARE PRE

01:55:11.971 --> 01:55:13.873
ESTABLISHED WITH THE MEDICATION

01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:15.575
PRACTICES ALSO THERE'S A LOT

01:55:15.642 --> 01:55:17.343
THAT'S BEEN DONE IN THAT SPACE --

01:55:17.410 --> 01:55:20.446
BUT NOT THOSE ALSO TEND TO BE --

01:55:20.513 --> 01:55:21.681
ELEMENTS FOR SOME OF THE AREAS

01:55:21.748 --> 01:55:22.815
WHERE IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT

01:55:22.882 --> 01:55:24.717
LONGER TO BE ABLE.

01:55:24.784 --> 01:55:26.019
TO DO THE NEGOTIATION WITHOUT

01:55:26.085 --> 01:55:27.020
SOME OF THE CUSTOMERS THAT

01:55:27.086 --> 01:55:28.354
REALLY LOVE THEIR TREE THAT WE

01:55:28.421 --> 01:55:29.455
DON'T UNDERSTAND KIND OF THE

01:55:29.522 --> 01:55:30.323
WRIST A WE'RE TRYING TO PUT

01:55:30.390 --> 01:55:30.990

WOULD SPEAK TO THE THE LABOR

01:56:46.065 --> 01:56:48.000
ISSUE BECAUSE IT BECAUSE THAT IS

01:56:48.067 --> 01:56:48.868
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE

01:56:48.935 --> 01:56:51.371
PUSHING HARD ON JUST UNDERSCORE --

01:56:51.437 --> 01:56:53.106
THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IS ONE

01:56:53.172 --> 01:56:54.273
THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET

01:56:54.340 --> 01:56:55.775
ADDITIONAL CREWS AND AND KEEP

01:56:55.842 --> 01:56:57.176
OUR WORK MOVING.

01:56:57.243 --> 01:56:58.611
OUT WE CAN ALWAYS USE MORE.

01:56:58.678 --> 01:56:59.612
BUT WE THINK ABOUT THE TRAIN

01:56:59.679 --> 01:57:01.614
LINE CREWS -- YOU KNOW THOSE

01:57:01.681 --> 01:57:03.316
APPRENTICE PROGRAMS ARE THREE

01:57:03.383 --> 01:57:04.083
YEARS LONG.

01:57:04.150 --> 01:57:05.852
AND EVEN WHEN YOU BRING

01:57:05.918 --> 01:57:07.387
RESOURCES IN FROM OUT OF STATE

01:57:07.453 --> 01:57:09.088
THEY NEED TO BE TRAINED AND

01:57:09.155 --> 01:57:10.890
UNDERSTAND OUR SYSTEM AND OUR

01:57:10.957 --> 01:57:12.024
WEEK WAY OF DOING THINGS.

01:57:12.091 --> 01:57:13.993
THAT IS NOT JUST PARTICULARITIES

01:57:14.060 --> 01:57:16.028
IT'S ACTUALLY ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS

01:57:16.095 --> 01:57:18.364
FROM UTILITY UTILITY SOMETIMES

01:57:18.431 --> 01:57:20.133
DIFFER IN MEANINGFUL WAYS --

01:57:20.199 --> 01:57:22.068
BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS WE

01:57:22.135 --> 01:57:24.137
TALK ABOUT PAYS WE TALK ABOUT

01:57:24.203 --> 01:57:24.771
THE RESOURCES WE NEED TO BRING

01:57:24.837 --> 01:57:25.605
ON BOARD.

01:57:25.671 --> 01:57:28.241
WE ALSO NEED TO BRING ON BOARD --

01:57:28.307 --> 01:57:31.277
WORKERS WHO OPERATE SAFELY AND

01:57:31.344 --> 01:57:33.112
ARE NOT A HAZARD TO THEMSELVES

01:57:33.179 --> 01:57:34.080
AND AND HAZARD TO PEOPLE AROUND

01:57:34.147 --> 01:57:35.348
THEM AND THAT YOU CAN DO THE

01:57:35.415 --> 01:57:36.616
WORK IN A QUALITY WAY.

01:57:36.682 --> 01:57:38.484
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IF WE DO A LOT

01:57:38.551 --> 01:57:39.852
OF INFRASTRUCTURE WORK AND IS

01:57:39.919 --> 01:57:41.187
NOT DONE -- TO THE QUALITY

01:57:41.254 --> 01:57:42.622
STANDARDS WE NEED.

01:57:42.688 --> 01:57:43.856
WE WE REALLY HAVEN'T DONE

01:57:43.923 --> 01:57:45.291
OURSELVES ANY FAVOR THE

01:57:45.358 --> 01:57:46.793
MITIGATION SPACE OKAY SO.

01:57:46.859 --> 01:57:48.327
THE OTHER THING IS TO GET THE

01:57:48.394 --> 01:57:49.429
BILLION DOLLARS I ASSUME YOU BE

01:57:49.495 --> 01:57:51.497
BORROWING MONEY AND THEN HAVING

01:57:51.564 --> 01:57:53.933
THAT HAVE PAID BACK BY RATE

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:55.268
PAYERS OVER TIME.

01:57:55.334 --> 01:57:55.802
THAT'S CORRECT.

01:57:55.868 --> 01:57:56.969
AND THEN.

01:57:57.036 --> 01:57:58.271
GIVEN THAT.

01:57:58.337 --> 01:58:05.711
YOU'VE BEEN DOWNGRADED SO GO

01:58:05.778 --> 01:58:07.447

01:58:08.448 --> 01:58:09.882
JUNK BOND STATUS.

DRIVE COSTS UP -- IN A IN A NOT

01:58:19.292 --> 01:58:20.593
INSUBSTANTIAL WAY THOUGH AND I

01:58:20.660 --> 01:58:22.728
THINK THAT THOSE COSTS WILL BE

01:58:22.795 --> 01:58:25.231
PASSED ON THROUGH BILLS OKAY SO

01:58:25.298 --> 01:58:27.767

02:03:47.620 --> 02:03:49.321
FROM THE PARTY'S SCORE HOW

THINK HALL ENOUGH.

02:04:34.133 --> 02:04:35.668
TO EVALUATE THAT THE UTILITIES

02:04:35.734 --> 02:04:37.837

EXPECTING THEM TO DO.

02:04:40.172 --> 02:04:42.208
ALL UNITS YOU LOOK AT THE PLANS

AND ELEMENT IN THE SOTHE COULD

02:06:18.203 --> 02:06:19.004
ONE OF THE THINGS THE COMMISSION

THE SAYINGS OF FOR US TO OVER

02:06:21.273 --> 02:06:22.608
TIME TO EVEN BEGIN TO BE.

A BE ABLE TO MAKE BETTER

02:06:24.576 --> 02:06:26.779
DECISIONS AROUND THIS WE NEED TO

02:06:26.845 --> 02:06:28.414

ACTUALLY HOW THE DATA BEHIND IT

02:06:35.421 --> 02:06:36.755
TO HOW MANY IGNITIONS AS AN

02:06:36.822 --> 02:06:44.229
EXAMPLE -- THEY REDUCE

02:06:44.296 --> 02:06:44.530
[inaudible]

02:06:44.596 --> 02:06:48.200
AND IT SAID THAT THAT THAT'S ONE

02:06:48.267 --> 02:06:50.235

SPACE I MEAN THIS FIRST ROUND WE

02:07:25.404 --> 02:07:27.139

AREAS.

02:08:49.455 --> 02:08:56.862
ALL MAY THINK WE ALSO LACKEY ELM.

02:08:56.929 --> 02:08:58.397
THE VISION OF WHERE ARE WE GOING

02:08:58.464 --> 02:08:59.498
WITH ALL OF THE S. THRE'S A LOT

02:08:59.565 --> 02:09:00.399
OF ACTIVITY THAT'S BEING

02:09:00.466 --> 02:09:01.967
PROPOSED AS THE PART OF WELFARE

02:09:02.034 --> 02:09:02.634
MITIGATION PLANS.

02:09:02.701 --> 02:09:03.936
IN THE GROUP LOOKS LIKE THE

02:09:04.002 --> 02:09:05.604
RIGHT TYPE OF ACTIVITY BUT WE

02:09:05.671 --> 02:09:07.239
DON'T REALLY HAVE AN ARTICULATED

02:09:07.306 --> 02:09:09.374
VISION OF WHAT GOALS WERE TRYING

02:09:09.441 --> 02:09:10.676
TO HIT.

02:09:10.742 --> 02:09:12.311
L. IN THE FUTURE.

02:09:12.377 --> 02:09:14.680
AND YOU KNOW WE HEAR A LOT OF

02:09:14.746 --> 02:09:16.815
YOU KNOW STATEMENTS ALL OF THIS

02:09:16.882 --> 02:09:18.417
IS GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME WE

02:09:18.484 --> 02:09:20.185
SHOULDN'T EXPECT THAT THIS FIRST

02:09:20.252 --> 02:09:21.386
ROUND THE WELFARE MITIGATION

02:09:21.453 --> 02:09:22.454
PLANS IN THESE EFFORTS THE

02:09:22.521 --> 02:09:23.822
UTILITIES ARE PUTTING A PLACE

02:09:23.889 --> 02:09:24.623
RIGHT NOW.

02:09:24.690 --> 02:09:26.158
WILL ADDRESS ALL WILD FIRE

02:09:26.225 --> 02:09:29.761
PROBLEMS THIS YEAR THIS WILDFIRE.

02:09:29.828 --> 02:09:30.796
SEASON THE THAT WERE DONE

02:09:30.863 --> 02:09:31.630
ANYTHING THIS GENERALLY

02:09:31.697 --> 02:09:33.799
RECOGNITION DIGITAL LEVEL OF

02:09:33.866 --> 02:09:35.334
COMPLEXITY OF THIS PROBLEM WE

02:09:35.400 --> 02:09:38.303
CAN EXPECT A SIMPLE SOLUTION.

02:09:38.370 --> 02:09:39.371
BUT I THINK WE NEED TO UNPACK

02:09:39.438 --> 02:09:41.373
THIS A BIT MORE AND GET MORE

02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:42.908
SPECIFIC WHAT DOES THIS MEAN HOW

02:09:42.975 --> 02:09:43.909
LONG OF A ROAD MAP WE'RE TALKING

02:09:43.976 --> 02:09:45.477
ABOUT SO WE TALKING ABOUT BEING

02:09:45.544 --> 02:09:47.479
ABLE TO SEE MEASURABLE RESULTS.

02:09:47.546 --> 02:09:50.015
IN FIVE YEARS OF THREE YEARS AND

02:09:50.082 --> 02:09:51.216
TEN YEARS IN FIFTY YEARS LIKE

02:09:51.283 --> 02:09:53.652
WAR AND AND HOW WE GOING.

02:09:53.719 --> 02:09:54.920
TO TRACK THAT AND WHAT DOES THAT

02:09:54.987 --> 02:09:56.989
SYSTEM OF THE FUTURE LOOK LIKE

02:09:57.055 --> 02:09:58.223
IS IT SOMETHING THAT'S MORE

02:09:58.290 --> 02:10:01.193
RELIANCE ON THE ON MICRO GRIDS.

02:10:01.260 --> 02:10:02.961
AND ELHAM.

02:10:03.028 --> 02:10:05.097
UNDER GROUNDING OR IS IT COVERED

02:10:05.164 --> 02:10:06.965
CONDUCTORS WHAT'S THE ROLE OF

02:10:07.032 --> 02:10:07.966
WHAT THE MONITORING AND HOLLER

02:10:08.033 --> 02:10:09.735
ALL THESE PIECES GOING TO COME

02:10:09.801 --> 02:10:11.069
TOGETHER AND WHERE ARE WE GOING.

02:10:11.136 --> 02:10:13.272
SO AGAIN RIGHT NOW THAT DOES NOT

02:10:13.338 --> 02:10:15.474
EXIST AND I THINK THAT'S A GAP

02:10:15.541 --> 02:10:16.642
THAT NEEDS TO BE FILLED.

02:10:16.708 --> 02:10:25.884
WELCOME AND IN TERMS ALL OF

02:10:25.951 --> 02:10:27.686
COMPLIANCE ELM YOU KNOW I THINK

02:10:27.753 --> 02:10:28.587
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT NEEDS

02:10:28.654 --> 02:10:30.289
TO BE DONE ON THAT FRONT AS WELL.

02:10:30.355 --> 02:10:32.991
ALL IS SPECIALLY A THING IN AS

02:10:33.058 --> 02:10:34.393
WE KIND OF WORK ON LARGER ISSUES

02:10:34.459 --> 02:10:36.061
THE WAY RIGHT NOW FACING.

02:10:36.128 --> 02:10:36.962
ALL OF REALLY ARTICULATING OF

02:10:37.029 --> 02:10:38.664
THE ROLE OF THE PLANS BECAUSE

02:10:38.730 --> 02:10:39.498
TYPICALLY WHEN YOU DOING

02:10:39.565 --> 02:10:40.999

BLACK AND WHITE.

02:10:47.472 --> 02:10:50.142
ALL MY PLANS GENERALLY PLAY AT

02:10:50.209 --> 02:10:53.011
THE FRONT OF THE ROLE -- HOME

02:10:53.078 --> 02:10:54.646
AND I THINK KIND OF FIGURING OUT

02:10:54.713 --> 02:10:56.815
THE BALANCE OF BLACK AND WHITE

02:10:56.882 --> 02:10:58.483
REGULATIONS THAT SET THE FLOOR

02:10:58.550 --> 02:11:00.385
THAT WE EXPECT THE 100%

02:11:00.452 --> 02:11:02.387

02:11:02.454 --> 02:11:04.356
ROLE OF THE PLANS.

02:11:04.423 --> 02:11:05.591
THAT -- MORE TO QUEUE LEADING

02:11:05.657 --> 02:11:06.925
THE PACE OF DEPLOYMENT OF

02:11:06.992 --> 02:11:08.327
CERTAIN PSYCHOLOGIES OR

02:11:08.393 --> 02:11:09.695

02:12:21.533 --> 02:12:22.668
THAT MEANS IN ADDITION TO

02:12:22.734 --> 02:12:24.770
FOCUSING ON PREVENTING UTILITY

02:12:24.836 --> 02:12:26.071
BECAUSE WILDFIRES.

WE ALSO HAVE TO INCLUDE PLANS ON

02:12:28.407 --> 02:12:30.175
MAKING SURE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES

02:12:30.242 --> 02:12:31.576

02:13:07.079 --> 02:13:09.348
INCLUSIVE -- APPROACH NOW A

02:13:09.414 --> 02:13:11.249
LARGE PORTION OF CAL FIRES

02:13:11.316 --> 02:13:12.984
MISSION IS TO WORK TOWARDS

02:13:13.051 --> 02:13:14.786
PREVENTING WILDFIRES -- FROM

02:13:14.853 --> 02:13:16.521
OCCURRING IN THE PAST COUPLE OF

02:13:16.588 --> 02:13:18.090
YEARS -- OBVIOUSLY WE'VE SEEN A

02:13:18.156 --> 02:13:19.624
TREND OF LARGER DAMAGING

02:13:19.691 --> 02:13:21.893
WILDFIRES -- THAT EVEN BECAUSE

02:13:21.960 --> 02:13:28.800
BY UTILITY OWNED A POWER LINES

02:13:28.867 --> 02:13:29.701
IN INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:13:29.768 --> 02:13:31.470
ANALYZING THE PAST FIVE YEARS OF

02:13:31.536 --> 02:13:32.971
OF FIRE DATA -- UTILITIES PARK

02:13:33.038 --> 02:13:34.239
WILDFIRES MAKE UP ABOUT 9% OF

02:13:34.306 --> 02:13:35.640
THE OVERALL WILDFIRES WITHIN OUR

02:13:35.707 --> 02:13:37.676
JURISDICTION OVER THE STATE

02:13:37.743 --> 02:13:39.077
RESPONSIBILITY AREA.

02:13:39.144 --> 02:13:40.479
HOWEVER THESE FIRES CONSTITUTE

02:13:40.545 --> 02:13:43.849
ABOUT 21% OF THE OVERALL ACRES --

02:13:43.915 --> 02:13:46.218
THAT ARE BURNED AND SO TYPICALLY

02:13:46.284 --> 02:13:47.219
WHAT WE FIND IN THESE TYPES OF

02:13:47.285 --> 02:13:49.521
FIRES IS THAT THEY ARE COUPLED

02:13:49.588 --> 02:13:51.456
WITH SIGNIFICANT WEATHER EVENTS --

02:13:51.523 --> 02:13:53.291
THAT FANNED THE FLAMES AND ALLOW

02:13:53.358 --> 02:13:55.694
THE FIRES TO GROW -- VERY

02:13:55.761 --> 02:13:57.696
QUICKLY AND VERY SIGNIFICANTLY.

02:13:57.763 --> 02:13:59.564
IN RECENT YEARS OUT WE FOCUS --

02:13:59.631 --> 02:14:01.032
TO IN SUPPORTING OUR STATEWIDE

02:14:01.099 --> 02:14:02.501
EFFORTS TO REDUCE UTILITIES PARK

02:14:02.567 --> 02:14:05.470
WILDFIRES -- QUITE HEAVILY NOW

02:14:05.537 --> 02:14:06.371
THREE YEARS AGO FOLLOWING THE

02:14:06.438 --> 02:14:08.607
PASSAGE OF SB AT TEN TWENTY

02:14:08.673 --> 02:14:10.275
EIGHT BY SENATOR HILL -- WHICH

02:14:10.342 --> 02:14:12.010
REQUIRED THE CHILI MITIGATION --

02:14:12.077 --> 02:14:14.045
PLANS -- TO BE FORMED -- CAL

02:14:14.112 --> 02:14:15.347
FIRE BEGAN ITS PARTNERSHIP WITH

02:14:15.414 --> 02:14:16.748
THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES

02:14:16.815 --> 02:14:18.750
COMMISSION -- IN PROVIDING OUR

02:14:18.817 --> 02:14:21.186
WILDFIRE EXPERTISE -- IN THE

02:14:21.253 --> 02:14:22.721
CREATION OF THE PLAN TEMPLATE.

02:14:22.788 --> 02:14:24.322
THE FOLLOWING YEAR -- WE WORK

02:14:24.389 --> 02:14:25.624
WITH THE C. P. YOU SEE AND WE

02:14:25.690 --> 02:14:26.958
PUT TOGETHER A MEMORANDUM OF

02:14:27.025 --> 02:14:28.627
UNDERSTANDING -- TO SHARE

02:14:28.693 --> 02:14:30.729
RESOURCES KNOWLEDGE -- AND BEST

02:14:30.796 --> 02:14:32.764
PRACTICES IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE

02:14:32.831 --> 02:14:34.533
THAT WE'RE DEVELOPING A STRATEGY

02:14:34.599 --> 02:14:35.934
THAT WAS A CONSISTENT APPROACH

02:14:36.001 --> 02:14:36.802
AMONGST.

02:14:36.868 --> 02:14:38.703
THE AGENCIES IN ORDER TO PREVENT

02:14:38.770 --> 02:14:40.038
THESE TYPES OF FIRES.

02:14:40.105 --> 02:14:42.707
NOW THIS MAY SOUND ROUTINE --

02:14:42.774 --> 02:14:44.009
BUT OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF

02:14:44.075 --> 02:14:45.677
YEARS I WOULD SAY THAT THAT THIS

02:14:45.744 --> 02:14:47.712
WORK AND THIS COLLABORATION I

02:14:47.779 --> 02:14:49.448
HAS BEEN CRITICAL.

02:14:49.514 --> 02:14:51.716
CAL FIRE BRINGS TO THE TABLE

02:14:51.783 --> 02:14:53.885
HERE EXPERTISE IN WILD FIRE

02:14:53.952 --> 02:14:55.020
SUPPRESSION WE HAVE EXT.

02:14:55.086 --> 02:14:56.888
A LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN

02:14:56.955 --> 02:14:58.290
PREVENTING THESE TYPES OF FIRES

02:14:58.356 --> 02:14:59.758
AND SO THAT'S WHAT ARE WHAT WE

02:14:59.825 --> 02:15:01.493
BRING TO THE REVIEW TEAM BUT

02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:02.928
I'LL JUST SPEAK FOR MY COLLEAGUE

02:15:02.994 --> 02:15:04.196
HERE THE CPUC.

02:15:04.262 --> 02:15:05.764
THEY BRING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

02:15:05.831 --> 02:15:07.065
OF KNOWLEDGE RELATED TO CHILE

02:15:07.132 --> 02:15:08.300
INFRASTRUCTURE UTILITY

02:15:08.366 --> 02:15:10.268
OPERATIONS REGULATION IN

02:15:10.335 --> 02:15:11.470
ENGINEERING THESE ARE NOT

02:15:11.536 --> 02:15:13.505
NECESSARILY -- ITEMS THAT WE

02:15:13.572 --> 02:15:15.273
HAVE AS AN AGENCY SO WORKING

02:15:15.340 --> 02:15:19.945
TOGETHER WORKING COLLABORATIVELY.WE WE CREATE A STRONG TEAM --

02:15:20.011 --> 02:15:21.847
THAT CAN TACKLE THESE ISSUES --

02:15:21.913 --> 02:15:23.782
AND AND SPECIFICALLY THESE

02:15:23.849 --> 02:15:25.217
ISSUES CRITICAL TO PUBLIC SAFETY.

02:15:25.283 --> 02:15:27.285
SO THE WALL FOR MITIGATION PLANS --

02:15:27.352 --> 02:15:28.687
AS I MENTIONED ARE AN OVERALL

02:15:28.753 --> 02:15:30.622
PART OF OUR OUR OVERALL UTILITY

02:15:30.689 --> 02:15:32.390
BECAUSE WILDFIRE PREVENTION

02:15:32.457 --> 02:15:34.793
EFFORTS -- AMONG OTHER THINGS IN

02:15:34.860 --> 02:15:36.628
THE PLANS -- WE ANALYZED WHERE

02:15:36.695 --> 02:15:38.797
ENHANCED VEGETATION MANAGEMENT

02:15:38.864 --> 02:15:41.266
IS NEEDED TO PREVENT CONTACT

02:15:41.333 --> 02:15:43.435
BETWEEN VEGETATION LIVE WIRES --

02:15:43.502 --> 02:15:44.769
WE LOOKED AT WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES

02:15:44.836 --> 02:15:46.371
THE POWER -- SHOULD BE SHUT OFF

02:15:46.438 --> 02:15:48.673
TEMPORARILY TO PROTECT PUBLIC

02:15:48.740 --> 02:15:50.809
SAFETY -- WHERE UTILITY SYSTEMS --

02:15:50.876 --> 02:15:52.677
SHOULD BE HARDENED AGAINST

02:15:52.744 --> 02:15:54.079
EXTREME WEATHER AND OTHER

02:15:54.145 --> 02:15:59.384
THREATS -- THREE USING THINGS

02:15:59.451 --> 02:16:00.752
LIKE COVERED CONDUCTORS AND FOR

02:16:00.819 --> 02:16:01.820
I RESISTED PULL MATERIALS LIKE

02:16:01.887 --> 02:16:02.454
YOU HEARD EARLIER AND WHERE AND

02:16:02.521 --> 02:16:03.522
WHEN OVERHEAD POWER LINES SHOULD

02:16:03.588 --> 02:16:04.656
BE RELOCATED UNDERGROUND.

02:16:04.723 --> 02:16:05.824
COMING BACK TO IT TOO TO SEE IF

02:16:05.891 --> 02:16:07.292
YOU SEE OUR INCREASE PARTNERSHIP

02:16:07.359 --> 02:16:09.461
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS --

02:16:09.528 --> 02:16:10.195
HAS ALREADY COMMITTED A PART

02:16:10.262 --> 02:16:12.631
TIME I IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR

02:16:12.697 --> 02:16:13.798
WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE

02:16:13.865 --> 02:16:15.300
COMMISSION TO REVIEW EIGHT OF

02:16:15.367 --> 02:16:16.635
THE WHILE FAR MITIGATION PLANS

02:16:16.701 --> 02:16:18.169
THAT HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED.

02:16:18.236 --> 02:16:19.905
NOW OUR ROLE AS DIRECTED IN LAST

02:16:19.971 --> 02:16:21.439
YEAR'S SB NINE A ONE BY SENATOR

02:16:21.506 --> 02:16:23.275
DODD -- WAS TO CONSULT WITH THE

02:16:23.341 --> 02:16:24.910
C. P. U. C. AND TO BRING OUR

02:16:24.976 --> 02:16:27.112
EXPERTISE AS I MENTIONED TO BEAR

02:16:27.178 --> 02:16:28.847
DURING THEIR REVIEW PROCESS.

02:16:28.914 --> 02:16:30.148
OUT OF THE NINETEEN REQUIRED

02:16:30.215 --> 02:16:32.217
ITEMS IN EACH PLAN SEVEN OF

02:16:32.284 --> 02:16:34.185
THOSE SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE

02:16:34.252 --> 02:16:35.987
WILDFIRE RELATED ITEMS.

02:16:36.054 --> 02:16:38.390
THOSE -- ITEMS INCLUDE WILDFIRE

02:16:38.456 --> 02:16:40.759
RISK AND RISK DRIVERS ASSOCIATED

02:16:40.825 --> 02:16:42.127
WITH TYPOGRAPHY AND CLIMATE --

02:16:42.193 --> 02:16:43.495
UTILITY PLANTS FOR VEGETATION

02:16:43.562 --> 02:16:45.697
MANAGEMENT -- AND PREVENTATIVE

02:16:45.764 --> 02:16:47.899
STRATEGIES TO MINIMIZE THE RISK

02:16:47.966 --> 02:16:49.701
OF LINES AND EQUIPMENT CAUSING

02:16:49.768 --> 02:16:52.070
CATASTROPHIC FIRE SO THESE SEVEN

02:16:52.137 --> 02:16:53.538
ELEMENTS REALLY WERE OUR FOCUS --

02:16:53.605 --> 02:16:55.140
WE BROUGHT -- WITHIN OUR OWN

02:16:55.206 --> 02:16:56.875
AGENCY SPECIALIST AND FIRE

02:16:56.942 --> 02:16:58.243
RESPONSE FIRE BEHAVIOR

02:16:58.310 --> 02:16:59.878
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WILDFIRE

02:16:59.945 --> 02:17:00.879
PLANNING.

02:17:00.946 --> 02:17:02.881
FIRE PREVENTION ENFORCEMENT AND

02:17:02.948 --> 02:17:04.349
COLLECTIVELY -- THESE --

02:17:04.416 --> 02:17:05.917
EMPLOYEES SPENT HUNDREDS OF

02:17:05.984 --> 02:17:10.388
HOURS REVIEWING THESE PLANS.

02:17:10.455 --> 02:17:11.122
NOW WHAT OUR SUBJECT MATTER

02:17:11.189 --> 02:17:12.090
EXPERTS -- WHO REVIEWED AND

02:17:12.157 --> 02:17:13.024
COMMENTED UPON -- THAT THAT

02:17:13.091 --> 02:17:14.559
INFORMATION WAS THEN --

02:17:14.626 --> 02:17:16.461
INCORPORATED INTO THE CPU SEES

02:17:16.528 --> 02:17:18.263
PROGRAM STAFF DEVELOPMENT OF

02:17:18.330 --> 02:17:20.165
THEIR PROPOSED GUIDANCE TO THE

02:17:20.231 --> 02:17:21.766
COMMISSION SO IT'S IMPORTANT

02:17:21.833 --> 02:17:23.368
NOTE THAT THAT IN OUR REVIEWING

02:17:23.435 --> 02:17:24.402
OF THESE PLANS WITH CHEAP YOU

02:17:24.469 --> 02:17:26.137
SEE WE REALLY ACTED AS A

02:17:26.204 --> 02:17:27.672
TECHNICAL ADVISOR TO THEM.

02:17:27.739 --> 02:17:28.607
OF THE COMMISSION OBVIOUSLY

02:17:28.673 --> 02:17:30.342
MAKES THE FINAL DETERMINATION ON

02:17:30.408 --> 02:17:31.710
WHAT COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS

02:17:31.776 --> 02:17:33.178
OUGHT TO BE INCORPORATED OR

02:17:33.244 --> 02:17:37.248
REFLECTED -- IN THE FINAL PLAN.

02:17:37.315 --> 02:17:37.882
SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE

02:17:37.949 --> 02:17:39.351
ASKED EARLIER IN AND KIND OF I

02:17:39.417 --> 02:17:40.552
THINK ONE OF THE IMPORTANT

02:17:40.619 --> 02:17:42.187
QUESTIONS IS YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO

02:17:42.253 --> 02:17:43.355
WITH ENFORCEMENT AND

02:17:43.421 --> 02:17:44.856
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLAN.

02:17:44.923 --> 02:17:46.658
AND WHILE THAT IS A FUNCTION OF

02:17:46.725 --> 02:17:48.360
THE THE C. P. U. C..

02:17:48.426 --> 02:17:50.662
WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK SIDE BY

02:17:50.729 --> 02:17:52.230
SIDE WITH THE C. P. YOU SEE --

02:17:52.297 --> 02:17:53.698
YOU KNOW BRING IN OUR EXPERTISE

02:17:53.765 --> 02:17:55.500
TO ASSIST IN MEETING THE

02:17:55.567 --> 02:17:56.835
OVERARCHING GOAL AND AND REALLY

02:17:56.901 --> 02:18:00.905
THE UNIFIED GOAL OF REDUCING

02:18:00.972 --> 02:18:02.207
UTILITIES PARK WILDFIRES.

02:18:02.273 --> 02:18:02.874
WE'VE ALREADY SEEN AN INCREASE

02:18:02.941 --> 02:18:04.676
IN COMMUNICATION NOT JUST AMONG

02:18:04.743 --> 02:18:06.177
START TO AGENCIES BUT BETWEEN

02:18:06.244 --> 02:18:07.946
OTHER STATE AGENCIES AND MORE

02:18:08.013 --> 02:18:09.981
IMPORTANTLY -- BETWEEN US AND

02:18:10.048 --> 02:18:12.584
THE UTILITIES.

02:18:12.651 --> 02:18:14.119
ANOTHER REPORT EDITION TO THESE

02:18:14.185 --> 02:18:15.987
PLANS THAT WE ARE LOOKING

02:18:16.054 --> 02:18:17.122
FORWARD TO SEEING IS AN

02:18:17.188 --> 02:18:18.823
INCREASED SHARING OF DATA.

02:18:18.890 --> 02:18:19.791
AS WAS MENTIONED THERE'S A LOT

02:18:19.858 --> 02:18:21.192
OF DATA THAT THE UTILITIES ARE

02:18:21.259 --> 02:18:22.694
COLLECTING AND WE WANT TO SEE

02:18:22.761 --> 02:18:24.462
HOW WE CAN ACCESS THAT DATA USE

02:18:24.529 --> 02:18:25.630
THAT DATA.

02:18:25.697 --> 02:18:27.832
AND SHARE OUR DATA AS WELL --

02:18:27.899 --> 02:18:29.267
FOR EXAMPLE -- LEVERAGING THE

02:18:29.334 --> 02:18:30.702
FUEL TREATMENTS PERFORMED BY

02:18:30.769 --> 02:18:32.937
UTILITIES -- IS IN A POOR ONE TO

02:18:33.004 --> 02:18:34.372
US WHEN AS WE LOOK AT WHERE WE

02:18:34.439 --> 02:18:35.774
PUT IN FUEL BREAKS IN AND AROUND

02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:37.909
COMMUNITIES WE WANT TO FIND WAYS

02:18:37.976 --> 02:18:38.376
WHERE WE CAN KIND OF

02:18:38.443 --> 02:18:40.111
COMPLEMENTARY -- TAKE THESE

02:18:40.178 --> 02:18:42.180
PROJECTS AND AND COORDINATE TO

02:18:42.247 --> 02:18:44.282
REALLY MAXIMIZE -- THE OVERALL

02:18:44.349 --> 02:18:45.250
EFFORT.

02:18:45.316 --> 02:18:47.385
SO AS I CONCLUDE I I JUST WANT

02:18:47.452 --> 02:18:48.887
TO STRESS AGAIN THERE IS NO

02:18:48.953 --> 02:18:52.190
SINGLE SILVER BULLET -- WILDFIRE

02:18:52.257 --> 02:18:57.028
MITIGATION ACTIVITY -- INCLUDING

02:18:57.095 --> 02:18:58.830
INDEPENDENTLY STOP CATASTROPHIC

02:18:58.897 --> 02:19:00.398
WILDFIRES FROM OCCURRING IN

02:19:00.465 --> 02:19:02.100
CALIFORNIA -- WE HAVE TO

02:19:02.167 --> 02:19:03.735
CONTINUE TO OBVIOUSLY MAKE

02:19:03.802 --> 02:19:05.403
STRIDES AT REDUCING UTILITIES

02:19:05.470 --> 02:19:07.405
PARK WILDFIRES -- BUT WE REALLY

02:19:07.472 --> 02:19:08.406
HAVE TO CONTINUE KIND OF THIS

02:19:08.473 --> 02:19:10.809
HOLISTIC APPROACH THE ALL OF THE

02:19:10.875 --> 02:19:12.677
ABOVE -- STRATEGY IN PROTECTING

02:19:12.744 --> 02:19:14.212
OUR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT AND OUR

02:19:14.279 --> 02:19:16.414
COMMUNITIES FROM WILDFIRES AND

02:19:16.481 --> 02:19:17.916
THE THOSE EFFORTS INCLUDE AS I

02:19:17.982 --> 02:19:19.350
MENTIONED FUEL REDUCTION AROUND

02:19:19.417 --> 02:19:21.119
COMMUNITY ENFORCING DEFENSIBLE

02:19:21.186 --> 02:19:21.753
SPACE.

02:19:21.820 --> 02:19:23.221
PLANNING COMMUNITIES THAT A

02:19:23.288 --> 02:19:25.824
RESILIENCE -- FOR WILDFIRES --

02:19:25.890 --> 02:19:27.192
IT RESTORING OUR FORCE LANDS

02:19:27.258 --> 02:19:29.160
BACK TO THEIR NATURAL HABITAT.

02:19:29.227 --> 02:19:31.196
AND IN LISTING THE PUBLIC AS A

02:19:31.262 --> 02:19:32.931
PARTNER -- THROUGH EDUCATION SO

02:19:32.997 --> 02:19:35.100

02:19:55.386 --> 02:19:56.154
OF THE PIECES THAT ARE IN THE

02:19:56.221 --> 02:19:57.889

02:19:57.956 --> 02:19:59.424
KNOW THIS ISN'T I BUDGET

02:19:59.491 --> 02:20:00.158
COMMITTEE HEARING BUT I THINK

02:20:00.225 --> 02:20:01.159
THEY'RE GONNA PROVIDE IMPORTANT

02:20:01.226 --> 02:20:02.227
INSIGHT TO A LOT OF THE

02:20:02.293 --> 02:20:03.027
QUESTIONS YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT.

02:20:03.094 --> 02:20:05.663
JUST CAPACITY FOR THE STATE TO

02:20:05.730 --> 02:20:07.065
OVERSEE AND EVALUATE THE WILD

02:20:07.132 --> 02:20:09.234

02:20:09.300 --> 02:20:10.268
OF HIGHLIGHT.

02:20:10.335 --> 02:20:11.369
SOME OF THE THE KEY GAPS AND AND

02:20:11.436 --> 02:20:11.936
WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS

02:20:12.003 --> 02:20:13.371
PROPOSING TO ADDRESS SOME OF

02:20:13.438 --> 02:20:17.175
THOSE AT LEAST IN THE NEAR TERM --

02:20:17.242 --> 02:20:19.677
SO -- THERE'S A VARIETY OF

02:20:19.744 --> 02:20:22.781
POSITIONS WERE AT P. YOU SEE FOR

02:20:22.847 --> 02:20:24.149
SERVER VIEWING THAT WHILE FIRE

02:20:24.215 --> 02:20:27.285
MITIGATION PLANS BUT I DO WANT

02:20:27.352 --> 02:20:27.752

02:20:36.628 --> 02:20:37.929
MENTIONED -- THERE'S SOME

02:20:37.996 --> 02:20:38.797
CONTRACTING FUNDS ONE IS TWENTY

02:20:38.863 --> 02:20:39.497
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN

02:20:39.564 --> 02:20:42.934

OR EXCUSE THIRD PARTIES FOR MORE

02:20:47.806 --> 02:20:50.141
KIND OF BOOT BOOTS ON THE GROUND

INSPECTION AND MONITORING.

02:20:52.443 --> 02:20:55.213
OF THE FUTILITY EQUIPMENT --

02:20:55.280 --> 02:20:57.215
THIS IS -- NOT TYPICALLY -- THE

02:20:57.282 --> 02:20:58.449
WORK THAT YOU SEE HAS DONE SO

02:20:58.516 --> 02:20:59.951
FAR AND SO I THINK THIS IS KIND

02:21:00.018 --> 02:21:04.455
OF A GOOD EXAMPLE THE HIGHLIGHTS

02:21:04.522 --> 02:21:04.956
KIND OF YOU KNOW WHAT.

02:21:05.023 --> 02:21:06.457
BUT NOT IN A STATE REGULATORS

02:21:06.524 --> 02:21:08.560
ARE CURRENTLY DOING -- BUT

02:21:08.626 --> 02:21:09.127
THEY'RE THEY'RE REQUESTING

02:21:09.194 --> 02:21:10.895
RESOURCES ON JUST A ONE TIME

02:21:10.962 --> 02:21:13.765
BASIS TO HIRE -- SOME THIRD

02:21:13.832 --> 02:21:14.866
PARTY TO AT TO HELP GET THAT

02:21:14.933 --> 02:21:17.468
WORK STARTED WITH THE VISION OF

02:21:17.535 --> 02:21:20.038
THE SB NINE OH ONE ESTABLISHED A

02:21:20.104 --> 02:21:20.605
PROCESS WHERE THE UTILITIES

02:21:20.672 --> 02:21:21.206

THAT -- AUDITING INSPECTION WORK --

02:21:28.546 --> 02:21:30.448
AND I MEAN IN OUR VIEW THE THE

02:21:30.515 --> 02:21:34.219
RIVER THE REQUEST IS REASONABLE --

02:21:34.285 --> 02:21:35.320
BUT IT AGAIN IT KIND OF

02:21:35.386 --> 02:21:36.788
HIGHLIGHTS A GAP THAT CURRENTLY

02:21:36.855 --> 02:21:37.589
EXISTS AND FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE

02:21:37.655 --> 02:21:39.424
WHAT'S A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT

02:21:39.490 --> 02:21:39.891
FROM THE LEGISLATURE'S

02:21:39.958 --> 02:21:41.726
PERSPECTIVE.

02:21:41.793 --> 02:21:43.661
IS TO MAKE SURE THE FOR THAT --

02:21:43.728 --> 02:21:45.563
TEMPORARY FUNDING THAT THE STATE

02:21:45.630 --> 02:21:47.165

02:21:47.232 --> 02:21:48.566
ABOUT.

02:21:48.633 --> 02:21:50.235
HOW THAT PROCESS IS INFORMING IN

02:21:50.301 --> 02:21:57.942
WHAT WORKS WHAT DOESN'T WORK YOU

02:21:58.009 --> 02:21:58.576
KNOW HOW THAT WOULD INFORM KIND

02:21:58.643 --> 02:22:01.379
OF FUTURE DECISIONS AND FUTURE

02:22:01.446 --> 02:22:04.182
IMPLEMENTATION OF OF THAT TYPE

02:22:04.249 --> 02:22:04.482
MONITORING?

TO HELP GUIDE THE WILDFIRE --

02:22:13.091 --> 02:22:17.562
POLICY FUNDING IS THINKING

02:22:17.629 --> 02:22:19.664
THROUGH -- SOME OF THESE

02:22:19.731 --> 02:22:21.332
EVALUATION METRICS THAT HAVE

02:22:21.399 --> 02:22:22.834
BEEN DISCUSSED AND SNOW WHEN

02:22:22.901 --> 02:22:24.035
ABOUT WHEN OF VALUE IN THE

02:22:24.102 --> 02:22:26.271

PROVIDE THE BEST INFORMATION ON

02:22:34.245 --> 02:22:36.180
WHETHER THE OUTCOMES THAT THE

02:22:36.247 --> 02:22:37.582

DOING THE MOST.

02:22:44.455 --> 02:22:46.758
TO REDUCE THE MAXIMUM Là RISK

02:22:46.824 --> 02:22:48.726
PER DOLLAR SPENT ON SO AGAIN WE

02:22:48.793 --> 02:22:50.094

02:22:52.897 --> 02:22:54.165
REASONABLE BUT AGAIN IT IT

02:22:54.232 --> 02:22:55.566
REALLY KIND OF HIGHLIGHTS.

02:22:55.633 --> 02:22:57.669

MEASURE THE OUTCOMES FROM A LOT

02:23:10.114 --> 02:23:11.449
OF THESE ACTIVITIES GOING

02:23:11.516 --> 02:23:12.483
FORWARD AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF

02:23:12.550 --> 02:23:13.051
WORK THAT.

02:23:13.117 --> 02:23:13.685

AS OUR OUR DECISIONS BEING MADE

02:23:32.370 --> 02:23:33.671

DOING -- DOING THE MOST TO

02:23:37.575 --> 02:23:39.377
REDUCE RISK WORK WE GET KIND OF

02:23:39.444 --> 02:23:40.545
THE BIGGEST BANG FOR FOR THE

02:23:40.611 --> 02:23:41.546
DOLLARS THAT WE'RE SPENDING ON

02:23:41.612 --> 02:23:44.615
REDUCING THAT RISK.

02:23:44.682 --> 02:23:46.517

IN PUTS INTO THE PROCESS FOR

02:23:54.625 --> 02:23:56.227

REGULATORY CHANGES AND AND AND

02:24:57.755 --> 02:25:01.292
WHAT MIGHT BE A NEW STRUCTURE

02:25:01.359 --> 02:25:03.327
THAT WE MIGHT ENTERTAIN OF TO

02:25:03.394 --> 02:25:05.630
GIVE A DIFFERENT KIND OF FOCUS

02:25:05.696 --> 02:25:06.464

MEANS THAT WE'RE SORT OF IN

02:25:26.317 --> 02:25:27.718
UNCHARTED WATERS AND THERE IS

02:25:27.785 --> 02:25:29.420
STILL SORT OF AN UNDERSTANDING

02:25:29.487 --> 02:25:30.088
OF HOW.

02:25:30.154 --> 02:25:32.924
WE'RE TO MOVE FORWARD -- AGAIN

02:25:32.990 --> 02:25:34.525
FROM THE REPORT -- LOOKING

02:25:34.592 --> 02:25:36.094
ACROSS THE COUNTRY THERE'S NO

02:25:36.160 --> 02:25:37.662
OTHER STATE IN THE NATION THAT'S

02:25:37.728 --> 02:25:38.596
DEALING WITH.

02:25:38.663 --> 02:25:40.264
THE THE NATURE OF CATASTROPHIC

02:25:40.331 --> 02:25:43.134
WILDFIRES AND ITS IMPACT AND ON

02:25:43.201 --> 02:25:45.870
THE UTILITY -- INDUSTRY AND AND

02:25:45.937 --> 02:25:47.305
THE HARDWARE IN THE EFFORT

02:25:47.371 --> 02:25:50.041
STRUCTURE THAT THE UTILITIES

02:25:50.108 --> 02:25:51.375
LINES MAKE BECAUSE IN THESE

02:25:51.442 --> 02:25:53.044
WILDFIRES IN AUSTRALIA IS

02:25:53.111 --> 02:25:54.112
PROBABLY THE ONLY PLACE I GUESS

02:25:54.178 --> 02:25:55.613
THAT COMES CLOSE TO WHERE WE CAN

02:25:55.680 --> 02:25:57.815
AT LEAST -- GET SOME TYPE OF

02:25:57.882 --> 02:25:59.417
COMPARISONS.

02:25:59.484 --> 02:26:00.785
AS SO WE ARE.

02:26:00.852 --> 02:26:03.187
IN A NEW PLACE AND WE'RE TRYING

02:26:03.254 --> 02:26:04.522
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MOVE

02:26:04.589 --> 02:26:06.457
FORWARD AND I THINK THAT.

02:26:06.524 --> 02:26:08.526
THE CPUC AND AND AND CERTAINLY

02:26:08.593 --> 02:26:09.994
IN YOUR LEADERSHIP ON ON SAFETY

02:26:10.061 --> 02:26:14.732
RELATED MEASURES HAS BEEN -- YOU

02:26:14.799 --> 02:26:20.571
KNOW VERY EFFECTIVE BUT WE NOW

02:26:20.638 --> 02:26:22.573
HAVE TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

02:26:22.640 --> 02:26:23.541
HA.

02:26:23.608 --> 02:26:24.675
YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHETHER THE

02:26:24.742 --> 02:26:26.144
CPUC IS THAT PLACE GOING FORWARD

02:26:26.210 --> 02:26:27.612
OR IF WE NEED TO HOW DO WE LOOK

02:26:27.678 --> 02:26:29.347
AT A BECAUSE CREATING SOME NEW

02:26:29.413 --> 02:26:31.115
STRUCTURE HOW DOES IT CONTINUE

02:26:31.182 --> 02:26:32.750
TO INTERFACE APPROPRIATELY WITH.

02:26:32.817 --> 02:26:39.524
CAL FIRE -- JUST A YOUR THOUGHTS.

02:26:39.590 --> 02:26:42.326
THEY SEE CURRENTLY TWO MAIN --

02:26:42.393 --> 02:26:45.630
GAPS IN THE IN THE CURRENT SIXTY

02:26:45.696 --> 02:26:46.864
CAN OF PARADIGM BUT WE HAVE SO

02:26:46.931 --> 02:26:48.866
THE FIRST GAP WAS IN THE POLICY

02:26:48.933 --> 02:26:50.067
MAKING ASPECT OF IT.

02:26:50.134 --> 02:26:52.303
TELL ME IS THAT WE ARE IN A

02:26:52.370 --> 02:26:54.338
REACTIVE MODE WE FOR THE SYSTEM

02:26:54.405 --> 02:26:55.740
WHERE WE HAVING UTILITIES COME

02:26:55.806 --> 02:26:57.542
UP WITH WELFARE MEDICATION PLANS

02:26:57.608 --> 02:26:58.709
AND THEN THE SUBMIT THEM WHEN WE

02:26:58.776 --> 02:27:00.511
REACT TO THEM RIGHT WHEN NOT

02:27:00.578 --> 02:27:01.746
DRIVING THE BUSES THE STATE.

02:27:01.812 --> 02:27:03.614
NOTED START DRIVING THE BUS AND

02:27:03.681 --> 02:27:06.083
ACTUALLY DEVELOP THE PLAN IN THE

02:27:06.150 --> 02:27:08.219
VALUATION FRAMEWORK AND FILLED

02:27:08.286 --> 02:27:10.288
THE GAPS THAT CURRENTLY EXIST

02:27:10.354 --> 02:27:11.556
WITH THERE'S NO REAL REGULATION

02:27:11.622 --> 02:27:13.224
FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S NO.

02:27:13.291 --> 02:27:15.059
STANDARD RIGHT NOW THAT SAYS

02:27:15.126 --> 02:27:16.027
WHAT WELL WHAT THE HARDENING

02:27:16.093 --> 02:27:18.362
USUALLY INFRASTRUCTURE FOR

02:27:18.429 --> 02:27:20.097
WILDFIRE PREVENTION LOOKS LIKE

02:27:20.164 --> 02:27:21.299
DELAYS HAVE OPINIONS ON AT

02:27:21.365 --> 02:27:23.201
COVERED CONDUCTOR INCREASING

02:27:23.267 --> 02:27:25.236
SPACING BETWEEN CONDUCT THERE'S

02:27:25.303 --> 02:27:26.871
A TO TREAT SUCH AS WELL WOULD TO

02:27:26.938 --> 02:27:27.672
STILL PULL REPLACEMENT.

02:27:27.738 --> 02:27:30.608
BUT THERE IS NO STANDARD LIKE IF

02:27:30.675 --> 02:27:31.976
YOU LIKE YOU HAVE AN BUILDING

02:27:32.043 --> 02:27:32.843
CODES RIGHT OF THE THAT THAT

02:27:32.910 --> 02:27:34.412
ACTUALLY EXISTS RIGHT IN ORDER

02:27:34.478 --> 02:27:35.379
TO DEVELOP THAT.

02:27:35.446 --> 02:27:37.281
THAT SEEKS RESOURCES IN THIS IS

02:27:37.348 --> 02:27:39.784
ALL VERY HIGH LEVEL.

02:27:39.850 --> 02:27:48.526
OF EXPERTISE THAT'S REQUIRED.

02:27:48.593 --> 02:27:50.428
HOME THERE ARE VERY FEW PEOPLE

02:27:50.494 --> 02:27:51.362
OUT THERE.

02:27:51.429 --> 02:27:53.564
ALL MY WHO HOW OF BOTH EXPERTISE

02:27:53.631 --> 02:27:54.765
AND WILD FIRE AND UTILITY

02:27:54.832 --> 02:27:55.600
INFRASTRUCTURE AT THE SAME TIME.

02:27:55.666 --> 02:27:56.934
ALL.

02:27:57.001 --> 02:27:59.103
GLOBALLY VERY FEW OF THEM AND

02:27:59.170 --> 02:28:00.571
THEY'RE OR OLD IN HIGH DEMAND

02:28:00.638 --> 02:28:01.339
AND WORKING SOMEWHERE.

02:28:01.405 --> 02:28:02.707
AND TO BUILD THAT LEVEL OF

02:28:02.773 --> 02:28:04.575
EXPERTISE THAT SEEKS PHENOMENAL

02:28:04.642 --> 02:28:07.178
AMOUNT OF TIME SO WHETHER IT'S

02:28:07.245 --> 02:28:09.247

WHO HALL OF ALL OF IT PLEASE

02:28:20.858 --> 02:28:22.927
VERY STRONG ANALYTICAL SKILLS

02:28:22.994 --> 02:28:24.595
AND THE LEAST SOME OF THE

02:28:24.662 --> 02:28:26.797
EXPERTISE TO BE ABLE TO KIND OF

02:28:26.864 --> 02:28:28.699

ALL MIX IT IN THE SAME THING SO

02:28:53.824 --> 02:28:55.059
THE SECOND GAP IS SORT OF THOSE

02:28:55.126 --> 02:28:57.662
BOOTS ON THE GROUND

02:28:57.728 --> 02:28:59.130
THE PC PROGRAM WAS ALWAYS

02:28:59.196 --> 02:29:03.100
DEVELOPED FILM THE TO DO OLD.

02:29:03.167 --> 02:29:06.804
AUDITS SO AND INVESTIGATIONS OF

02:29:06.871 --> 02:29:09.640
INCIDENTS ELM IT WAS NEVER TO DO

02:29:09.707 --> 02:29:12.243
INSPECTIONS AT SCALE OF UTILITY

02:29:12.310 --> 02:29:14.145
INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE GROUND --

02:29:14.211 --> 02:29:16.614
THAT KEY CAPABILITIES IS IS NOT

02:29:16.681 --> 02:29:25.556
EXISTENCE -- SO.

02:29:25.623 --> 02:29:27.358
ON THE RAIL SIDE WE ACTUALLY

02:29:27.425 --> 02:29:27.958
HAVE MORE OF A FIELD PRESENCE

02:29:28.025 --> 02:29:30.561
WHERE WE ARE INSPECTORS WALKED

02:29:30.628 --> 02:29:32.863
TRACK ELEMENT AND DO THAT KIND

02:29:32.930 --> 02:29:33.831
OF ON THE GROUND IT'LL IT'LL

02:29:33.898 --> 02:29:34.432
INSPECTION WITH EVERY MILE OF

02:29:34.498 --> 02:29:35.966
TRACKING IN CALIFORNIA.

02:29:36.033 --> 02:29:39.737
IS INSPECTED BY THE BY THE STATE

02:29:39.804 --> 02:29:43.374
PROGRAM SO WE HELP OF FORTY

02:29:43.441 --> 02:29:46.677
PEOPLE [inaudible] FOR OF FOUR

02:29:52.850 --> 02:29:55.086
THAT WE DO WHAT RAIL.

02:29:55.152 --> 02:29:58.489
IT'S ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED

02:29:58.556 --> 02:29:59.123
THIRTEEN HUNDRED FIFTEEN HUNDRED

02:29:59.190 --> 02:30:01.625

AND TWENTY FIVE WILLIAM DOLLAR

02:30:04.395 --> 02:30:05.429
BUDGETS IT JUST BECAUSE OF THE

02:30:05.496 --> 02:30:06.864
LEVEL OF EXPERTISE AGAIN PLUS

02:30:06.931 --> 02:30:08.432
THE LABOR SHORTAGES THAT WE'RE

02:30:08.499 --> 02:30:09.367

EXISTS AND WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE

02:30:18.943 --> 02:30:21.645
IT.

REVISE A THING CALLED IN THE

02:30:30.554 --> 02:30:31.255
SHORT TERM.

AT LEAST GET STARTED AND START

02:30:32.656 --> 02:30:34.291
GETTING MORE DATA I THINK WITH

02:30:34.358 --> 02:30:36.627
THE POLICY ASPECT YOU KNOW CAN

02:30:36.694 --> 02:30:37.561
BE DEFINITELY.

FRAME TO FILL THOSE GAPS.

02:30:42.400 --> 02:30:45.169
I THINK AS FAR AS INSPECTIONS ON

02:30:45.236 --> 02:30:50.574
THE GROUND A A THING THAT SEE

02:30:50.641 --> 02:30:52.443
HERE REAL.

02:30:52.510 --> 02:30:53.844
HELLO A LONG COMPLICATED DEBATE

02:30:53.911 --> 02:30:55.479
AS TO THE YOU KNOW THE ROLE THAT

02:30:55.546 --> 02:30:56.947
WE WANT TO PLAY AS THE STATE'S

02:30:57.014 --> 02:30:57.681
OVERSIGHT OF UTILITIES.

02:30:57.748 --> 02:30:58.716
AND HOW TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE

02:30:58.783 --> 02:31:02.052
AND HOW MUCH OF OF THIS.

02:31:02.119 --> 02:31:04.388
SORT OF IN PHYSICAL INSPECTION

02:31:04.455 --> 02:31:05.623
OF INFRASTRUCTURE WE WANT TO BE

02:31:05.689 --> 02:31:07.525
DOING THE STATE'S EMPLOYEES OR

02:31:07.591 --> 02:31:09.727
WITH THIRD PARTIES OR CONTINUING

02:31:09.794 --> 02:31:10.795
RELYING.

02:31:10.861 --> 02:31:13.364
ON UTILITIES TO DO THAT WORK AND

02:31:13.431 --> 02:31:15.966
MORE ACTING THROUGH A STRICT

02:31:16.033 --> 02:31:19.236
ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS WHEN THEY'RE

02:31:19.303 --> 02:31:19.870
NOT DOING WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED

02:31:19.937 --> 02:31:25.009
TO BE DOING [inaudible]

02:31:25.075 --> 02:31:26.877
SO.

02:31:26.944 --> 02:31:29.413
FIRST OF ALL. 21% OF THE ACREAGE

02:31:29.480 --> 02:31:31.182
IS SEEN IS CAUSED BY AN

02:31:31.248 --> 02:31:32.716
ELECTRICAL LINES.

02:31:32.783 --> 02:31:34.819
YET IT SEEMS LIKE WE'VE HAD A

02:31:34.885 --> 02:31:36.086
BAD RUN OF LUCK FOR THE

02:31:36.153 --> 02:31:38.456
UTILITIES IT SEEMS LIKE MOST OF

02:31:38.522 --> 02:31:40.090
THE DAMAGING FIRES.

02:31:40.157 --> 02:31:41.425
HAVE COME FROM THE UTILITIES

02:31:41.492 --> 02:31:42.993
PERHAPS IS JUST AROUND OF LOCKER

02:31:43.060 --> 02:31:44.862
PERHAPS IS TO CHANGE BECAUSE OF

02:31:44.929 --> 02:31:46.297
CLIMATE CHANGE THERE'S DIFFERENT

02:31:46.363 --> 02:31:47.465
CONDITIONS.

02:31:47.531 --> 02:31:53.370
FEWER ELECTRICAL STORMS -- MORE --

02:31:53.437 --> 02:31:56.340
MORE HIGH WINDS AND PERHAPS IT'S

02:31:56.407 --> 02:31:58.909
ALSO HARDER -- TO CONTAIN THE

02:31:58.976 --> 02:32:00.611
FIRES AGAIN BECAUSE OF GLOBAL

02:32:00.678 --> 02:32:02.446
WARMING IN PARTICULAR YOU DON'T

02:32:02.513 --> 02:32:04.014
GET DO AT NIGHT ANYMORE BECAUSE

02:32:04.081 --> 02:32:05.282
THE NIGHTS WARM UP MORE THAN

02:32:05.349 --> 02:32:06.383
THAT DAY.

02:32:06.450 --> 02:32:08.452
SO I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY WERE

02:32:08.519 --> 02:32:10.721
LOOKING AT THE MOST IMPORTANT

02:32:10.788 --> 02:32:13.824
FACTOR OR MISSING THE 80% -- BUT

02:32:13.891 --> 02:32:16.527
TO THE EXTENT THAT OVER TIME YOU --

02:32:16.594 --> 02:32:18.395
TALKING TO CAL FIRE YOU HAVE

02:32:18.462 --> 02:32:19.563
INSIDE IN THAT.

02:32:19.630 --> 02:32:20.698
THAT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS WE

02:32:20.764 --> 02:32:22.166
NEED TO LOOK AT I WOULD HOPE YOU

02:32:22.233 --> 02:32:23.367
WOULD GET BACK TO THE

02:32:23.434 --> 02:32:24.568
LEGISLATURE.

02:32:24.635 --> 02:32:26.737
WELL IF I COULD JUST ADD TO THAT

02:32:26.804 --> 02:32:28.339
YOU ARE CORRECT CHANGING CLIMATE

02:32:28.405 --> 02:32:30.374
ABSOLUTELY HAS A HUGE ROLE IN

02:32:30.441 --> 02:32:31.442
WHAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING OVER THE

02:32:31.509 --> 02:32:33.110
LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WITH THE

02:32:33.177 --> 02:32:34.411
SEVERITY OF WILDFIRES.

02:32:34.478 --> 02:32:36.146
GET IF YOU JUST COMPARE THE THE

02:32:36.213 --> 02:32:37.448
THE IT'S ALMOST DOUBLE THE

02:32:37.515 --> 02:32:38.449
AMOUNT OF ACRES TO THE

02:32:38.516 --> 02:32:40.217
PERCENTAGE OF NUMBER FIRES AND

02:32:40.284 --> 02:32:41.552
OFTEN THAT'S AS I MENTIONED

02:32:41.619 --> 02:32:42.953
BECAUSE YOU HAVE WERE WE SEE

02:32:43.020 --> 02:32:44.922
THAT THESE -- UTILI SPARK FIRES

02:32:44.989 --> 02:32:47.424
OCCURRING WHEN THERE'S EXTREME

02:32:47.491 --> 02:32:49.059
WINDS NON SO IT CHANGES CLIMATE

02:32:49.126 --> 02:32:50.594
IS IS OBVIOUSLY A COMPONENT BUT

02:32:50.661 --> 02:32:52.796
I WOULD ALSO ADD THAT -- YOU

02:32:52.863 --> 02:32:53.731
KNOW THE CONDITION OF OUR

02:32:53.797 --> 02:32:56.233
FORESTS PLAYS A HUGE ROLE OF ONE

02:32:56.300 --> 02:32:57.768
OF THE REASONS WHY WHY IN SANTA

02:32:57.835 --> 02:33:00.004
ROSA IN THE THE TUBS FIRE OR

02:33:00.070 --> 02:33:01.572
EVEN GO LOOK AT THE CAMPFIRE.

02:33:01.639 --> 02:33:03.173
THE FACT THAT WE HAD A FIRE WITH

02:33:03.240 --> 02:33:04.508
SUCH INTENSITY THAT WAS ABLE TO

02:33:04.575 --> 02:33:06.844
BURN SO QUICKLY WAS NOT JUST

02:33:06.911 --> 02:33:09.246
BECAUSE OF EXTREME WIND WHICH

02:33:09.313 --> 02:33:10.180
WAS A FACTOR.

02:33:10.247 --> 02:33:11.515
BUT ALSO THE FACT THAT THE

02:33:11.582 --> 02:33:14.018
VEGETATION IS SO OVERGROWN AND

02:33:14.084 --> 02:33:16.186
THEN YOU ALLOW IT -- AFTER YEARS

02:33:16.253 --> 02:33:18.155
OF DROUGHT TO DRY OUT -- FIRES

02:33:18.222 --> 02:33:20.090
CAN RACE UP TO A COMMUNITY MUCH

02:33:20.157 --> 02:33:21.425
QUICKER AND THAT'S ONE OF THE

02:33:21.492 --> 02:33:22.693
REASONS THAT I REALLY STRESSED

02:33:22.760 --> 02:33:24.161
AND WE WE CONTINUE PUT A LOT OF

02:33:24.228 --> 02:33:26.564
FOCUS IN ON THESE FUEL REDUCTION

02:33:26.630 --> 02:33:28.632
PROJECTS SO THAT -- YOU KNOW EAT

02:33:28.699 --> 02:33:30.668
WHEN THESE FIRES DO OCCUR

02:33:30.734 --> 02:33:32.303
BECAUSE THE THE TRUTH IS.

02:33:32.369 --> 02:33:34.104
FIRE THAT IS ALWAYS BEEN HERE IN

02:33:34.171 --> 02:33:35.673
CALIFORNIA WELL BEFORE US WE ARE

02:33:35.739 --> 02:33:37.007
NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO PREVENT

02:33:37.074 --> 02:33:39.076
EVERY SINGLE FIRE AND SO WE HAVE

02:33:39.143 --> 02:33:41.545
TO PREPARE -- BUT I WOULD STRESS

02:33:41.612 --> 02:33:43.347
AGAIN CHANGING CLIMATE JUST MAKE

02:33:43.414 --> 02:33:45.115
THAT MORE DIFFICULT -- BUT AN

02:33:45.182 --> 02:33:46.483
OVERGROWN FORCED ON A HEALTHY

02:33:46.550 --> 02:33:48.886
FOREST -- ALLOWS THE INTENSITY

02:33:48.953 --> 02:33:50.654
OF THE FIRES THAT TO BECOME MUCH

02:33:50.721 --> 02:33:52.222
MORE CHALLENGING FOR US TO FIGHT

02:33:52.289 --> 02:33:52.690
YEAH.

02:33:52.756 --> 02:33:54.858
I'M ALSO VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

02:33:54.925 --> 02:33:56.193
WHERE WE HAVE HOUSING.

02:33:56.260 --> 02:34:01.799
A PARADISE WAS KNOWN TO BE IT IS

02:34:01.865 --> 02:34:02.766
AFTER WAITING TO HAPPEN SINCE

02:34:02.833 --> 02:34:03.834
THE EIGHTIES BECAUSE IT IS AN

02:34:03.901 --> 02:34:04.535
AREA WITH.

02:34:04.602 --> 02:34:06.303
THAT TECH GETS EXTREME WINDS ARE

02:34:06.370 --> 02:34:07.471
AND ALSO THAT IT DIDN'T HAVE ACT

02:34:07.538 --> 02:34:08.939
ADEQUATE TO EXITS AND IN FACT.

02:34:09.006 --> 02:34:10.307
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE

02:34:10.374 --> 02:34:11.508
CITY ACTUALLY NARROWED SOME

02:34:11.575 --> 02:34:12.843
STREETS BECAUSE THEY WERE

02:34:12.910 --> 02:34:15.279
WORRIED ABOUT PEDESTRIAN SAFETY.

02:34:15.346 --> 02:34:16.680
AND THAT BECAUSE SOME OF THE

02:34:16.747 --> 02:34:17.915
PROBLEMS AS WELL THEN PEOPLE

02:34:17.982 --> 02:34:20.417
WOULD GET CAUGHT IN A CUL DE SAC

02:34:20.484 --> 02:34:22.920
AND NOT BE ABLE TO GET OUT SO.

02:34:22.987 --> 02:34:24.622
MANY PROBLEMS THERE I WISH THERE

02:34:24.688 --> 02:34:27.291
WERE A WAY WE COULD RELOCATE

02:34:27.358 --> 02:34:29.326
PARADISE [inaudible]

02:34:29.393 --> 02:34:30.728
THAT TIME.

02:34:30.794 --> 02:34:31.295
I HAVEN'T SEEN THE WAY TO DO

02:34:31.362 --> 02:34:32.896
THAT.

02:34:32.963 --> 02:34:36.166
AT ANY RATE SO -- MS MALASHENKO.

02:34:36.233 --> 02:34:38.035
I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

02:34:38.102 --> 02:34:39.637
ABOUT REACTING [inaudible]

02:34:39.703 --> 02:34:44.475
AND WHAT I ASKED THE UTILITY

02:34:44.541 --> 02:34:46.543
REPRESENTATIVES WAS -- CAN YOU

02:34:46.610 --> 02:34:48.078
TELL US WHAT'S MOST COST

02:34:48.145 --> 02:34:49.680
EFFECTIVE AND IT ONLY HAS TO

02:34:49.747 --> 02:34:53.684
AVOID WONDER TWO FIRES A DECADE.

02:34:53.751 --> 02:34:56.220
AND IF IF FOR EXAMPLE UNDER

02:34:56.286 --> 02:34:58.088
GROUNDING I AGREE IS MUCH MORE

02:34:58.155 --> 02:34:59.757
EXPENSIVE NOT ONLY IN.

02:34:59.823 --> 02:35:01.725
THE CAPITAL TO DO WHAT THAT IN

02:35:01.792 --> 02:35:02.593
THE MAINTENANCE.

02:35:02.660 --> 02:35:04.995
BUT IF IN THE COURSE OF YOUR

02:35:05.062 --> 02:35:06.463
HIRING THESE EXPERTS AND

02:35:06.530 --> 02:35:08.899
CONSULTANTS YOU COULD TRY TO TRY

02:35:08.966 --> 02:35:12.536
TO GO -- DO SOME WORK TO

02:35:12.603 --> 02:35:14.538
DETERMINE WHAT IS THE MOST COST

02:35:14.605 --> 02:35:16.206
EFFECTIVE IT MAY NOT BE THE

02:35:16.273 --> 02:35:18.676
CHEAPEST THING TO DO RIGHT NOW.

02:35:18.742 --> 02:35:20.844
IT MAY VERY IN THE LONG RUN.

02:35:20.911 --> 02:35:23.514
AND I HOPE YOU CAN DO THAT ALSO

02:35:23.580 --> 02:35:26.183
THE QUESTION ABOUT THAT WE GOT

02:35:26.250 --> 02:35:27.384

02:35:28.652 --> 02:35:30.320
RESOURCES TO DO THAT THE ANSWER

02:35:30.387 --> 02:35:31.422
IS CLEARLY.

02:35:31.488 --> 02:35:32.423
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE THE RIGHT

02:35:32.489 --> 02:35:34.224
PEOPLE AND THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE

02:35:34.291 --> 02:35:35.626
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T HAD THAT

02:35:35.693 --> 02:35:41.098
