THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT -- A. B. TWENTY NINE A SOLUTION TO A PROBLEM THAT HAS BEEN DIVIDING THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY FOR FAR TOO LONG. THE BILL REMOVES THE MOST DISPUTED LAND YOU KNOW THE SR SEVEN AND FROM THE FREEWAY AND EXPRESSWAY CODE ALIGNING THE LAW. WITH THE DESIRES OF THE CITIES AND THE FINALIZE CALTRAIN AND YEAH I ARE. FOR TOO LONG OF THE STATE HAS BEEN TRYING TO DICTATE WHEN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY CAN DO WHAT IT CAN DO WITH ITS AREA WITHIN THIS AREA. AS SORT OF A COLLABORATIVE SOLUTION CALTRANS CREATED AN EITHER OR SITUATION THAT REQUIRED THE COMMUNITIES TO TAKE SIDES ALMOST SIXTY YEARS AGO BY PROPOSING A FREEWAY. THAT KEPT THIS LAND STAGNANT FOR YEARS AND WHILE THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY GREW AND DEVELOPED AROUND IT. LAST YEAR LA METRO CALTRANS A CLEAR THE LOOK LOCALLY PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE TO BE TRAFFIC DEMAND MANAGEMENT NOT A FREEWAY. THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE FINALIZED BY OUR NOW ALL OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT USED TO BE AT ODDS. ARE AT THE TABLE TOGETHER DISCUSSING HOW TO MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS UNFATHOMABLE JUST ONE YEAR AGO. I PLAN TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE IMPACT OF CITIES IN CALTRANS TO TAKE THE NEXT STEPS WHICH INCLUDES RELINQUISHING THE LAND INTO THEIR JURISDICTION TO ALLOW THEM TO DECIDE HOW. THIS DISPUTED LAND SERVE THE WHOLE COMMUNITY. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW THEM TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING CREATE GREEN SPACE GREAT BIKE LANES AND DEDICATED BUS ROUTES INSTEAD OF CROWDED STREETS. BUILD MAKES YOU SPACE SPACES FOR RETAIL HOUSING ENTERTAINMENT AND WHATEVER ELSE THESE COMMUNITIES CAN DREAM UP. WE'RE AT A TIPPING POINT WITH WITH THE SIXTY YEAR PROJECT AND ASK THE COMMITTEE TO HELP US GET OVER THE FINISH LINE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK A REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL AND LET ME ALSO STATE -- THIS BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MISTER WILL YOU HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL I DO. NAMELY REPRESENT PLEASE. GET UP NUCLEAR ROSS ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF PASADENA. REMOVING THE ROADWAY FROM THE STATE HIGHWAY INVENTORIES BUT THE TOP PRIORITY FOR THE CITY AND AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN KNITTING THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. BACK TOGETHER WITH MANY CRITICAL LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS INCLUDING NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE ARE THANKFUL FOR THE AUTHORS EFFORTS ON THIS ISSUE AND READY TO WORK WITH ALL THE LOCAL AND STATE PARTNERS ON THIS PROJECT TO CONTINUE THE PROCESS OF RELINQUISHMENT.

SEEING NONE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE AUTHOR. QUESTION OF RIGHT. THIS BILL WOULD MISTER HALL HOW DO YOU -- HOW DO YOU THINK THIS WILL IMPACT THE FUTURE CAPACITY OF THE SEVEN TEN TAKING THE TUNNEL PROJECT OFF THE TABLE IN A SENSE? WELL I THINK THAT WHAT WE RECOGNIZE THE CALTRANS AND LA METRO WE'RE BASICALLY GIVING SOME DIRECTIONS AROUND A VARIETY OF OPTIONS -- OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY HAVE THEIR VARIOUS IDEAS OF WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST SOLUTION BUT THE ONE THAT. HAS UNANIMOUS WERE NEAR UNANIMOUS SUPPORT IS THE ALTERNATIVE THAT WAS SELECTED -- BY CALTRANS AND ULTIMATELY -- ENDORSED BY -- SELECTED BY METRO AND CULTURE AND SO WE HAVE -- AN APPROACH THAT I THINK IT BRINGS. UNITY TO EVERYONE IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT ON THE AREA I CAN ONLY TELL YOU WHAT THE IMPACT HAS BEEN ON THE SURROUNDING AREA. FOR ALL THESE MANY YEARS AND IT'S BEEN -- VERY MUCH -- AN IMPACTED THIS DEVASTATED AREA BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE WE'RE PURSUING I THINK ARE GOING TO BREAK THE RIGHT KIND OF HARMONY. AND MOVEMENT OF TRAFFIC AND THERE CAN THE RIGHT WAY. THANK YOU HI I APPRECIATE THAT THAT'S ALWAYS A TUG. THE TUSSLING THAT'S GOING ON WITH LOCALS IN THE STATE ON MANY OF OUR PROJECTS BECAUSE A LOCAL SEE IT ONE WAY AND THE STATE SEASON ANOTHER SO THAT BRINGS UP THE SECOND QUESTION WHICH WOULD BE. HOW DO WE FOCUS ON THE FACT THAT WE HAVE AN EVER INCREASING CAPACITY NEED FOR MANY OF THE HIGHWAY SEVENTEEN BEING ONE OF THOSE AND WE'RE NOW? GONNA HAVE A BOTTLE NECK. ESSENTIALLY IN THAT THAT AREA THAT WE'RE REFERRING TO HERE. YEAH WE'RE GOING TO HAVE PROJECTS STILL ON THE CONSTRUCTION CORD OF CALTRANS MISSION TO INCREASE CAPACITY ON THE SEVENTY AND THAT WILL CAUSE. A RESTRICTION THAT WILL BE IMPACTED BY NOW THIS RESTRICTING AREA SO MY CONCERN IS JUST. HAVE WE TALKED ENOUGH WITH CALTRANS ABOUT THEIR FUTURES FOR THE SEVEN TEN AS A WHOLE AND WHAT IS THE LAND MANAGEMENT PRACTICE OF THE LOCALS. AS YOU SAID SOME OF THIS IS GOING. TO BE UNITS ON THIS LAND WE UTILIZE FOR GROWTH POTENTIAL YET THE HIGHWAY WON'T BE ABLE TO HANDLE THAT GROWS SO WHERE HOW DO WE RESOLVE THAT CONFLICT AND FUTURE PLANNING. I DON'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT. I KNOW THAT WAS A VERY LENGTHY QUESTIONS WE WANT TO GIVE YOU AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO BE ABLE TO THINK ABOUT AN ANSWER BUT I NEED TO GO FROM.

BUT DOING AND ONE THAT IS RESPECTING SO THE MOVEMENT -- THAT WE SEE -- WE'RE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR CARS RIGHT SO YES THIS CAPACITY BUT THERE'S ALSO -- THE RECOGNITION THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT LIGHT RAIL PROJECTS AND MOVING PEOPLE THROUGH PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION -- COLLECT CONNECTING THE REGION AND AND A MORE SYNCHRONIZE AN APPROPRIATE WAY WE'RE WORKING WITH CALTRANS -- AND WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH METRO -- AND SAN DIEGO COUNTY TO EXTEND LIGHT RAIL OUT INTO THE SAMBAR DEER COUNTY OR SO THERE'S A RECOGNITION THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE.

GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS TODAY AND PRESENTING A. B. TWO SIXTY NINE WHICH WAVES THE PRACTICAL PORTION OF THE DRIVER'S TEST WHEN APPLYING FOR A CALIFORNIA DRIVER'S LICENSE FOR THOSE CALIFORNIANS ALREADY IN POSSESSION OF A VALID. FOR A FOREIGN DRIVERS LICENSE UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW. AS WAS NOTED BEFORE WITH THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE AND THIS. AS A SPECIFIC LEGISLATION HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT AND MOVE FORWARD AND ANALYZE. SEVERAL TIMES AND WE ARE HOPING THAT THIS TIME WILL BE THE TIME WILL YOU WILL SAY YES. EXISTING LAW ENABLES THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND POSSESSION OF OF A VALID FOREIGN. LICENSE DETERMINED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE DMV TO DRIVING CALIFORNIA'S ROADS AND HIGHWAYS. THIS BILL EXTENDS THIS POLICY O ENSURE THE SAME DRIVERS ARE ALSO FREE AND CLEAR TO GET A CALIFORNIA DRIVER'S LICENSE AS READILY AS THEY ARE ABLE THIS IS A MATTER OF MAKING SURE WE HAVE UNIFORMITY. AMONG DRIVERS AND THAT THEY ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE SPECIFICS OF CALIFORNIA TRAFFIC LAWS. AUTHORIZING THE DMB TO SIGN RECIPROCAL MEMORANDUMS OF UNDERSTANDING WITH THOSE COUNTRIES WITH WHOM WE SHARE SAFE DRIVING STANDARDS IS AN ACT OF GOOD WILL TOWARDS AYE OUT OUR TRADE PARTNERS AND ALLIES -- TODAY I HAVE WITH ME HAWKS SO RUE WHO IS IN SUPPORT. PLEASE TEACH NAMELY REPRESENTING PLEASE. THAT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS I FEEL PRIVILEGE IT TO SIT HERE ON BEHALF OF QUICK KOREAN GOVERNMENT. I SINCERELY SUPPORT AB TWO SIX NINE ONE WRIST PROCAR TRIBAL LICENSE PROGRAM. I AM PERSONALLY AWARE OF THE BENEFITS FROM THIS MUTUAL RECOGNITION OF TRIBAL LICENSE. AS A DIPLOMAT. MY DRIVER LICENSE FEE EACH I HAD RECEIVED IN KOREA EATS RECOGNIZED IN MANY COUNTRIES INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES. SO I ENJOY DRIVING IN CALIFORNIA AND ACTUALLY TO ATTEND THIS COMMITTEE MEETING I TOLD. ALL THE WAY FROM LOS ANGELES TO SACRAMENTO THIS MORNING. AND THOUGHT OF THE BENEFITS THIS MUTUAL RECOGNITION SYSTEM CAN MAKE. TWO EIGHTY CALIFORNIANS AND FOURTEEN OTHERS WHO'VE VISIT DISCORDANCE PAID. INCLUDING KOREA. HAVING SAID THAT THIS IS TEN GIVES MANY BENEFITS TO THE CALIFORNIANS AND THE GOVERNMENT FIRST. THE CALIFORNIANS WHO VISIT FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND STAYED THERE CAN ENJOY DRIVING CARDS. WITHOUT TAKING EXAMINATIONS. SECOND. WHEN THIS IS TEN EIGHTY STABILISED THE TEMPORARY ARE NOT REQUIRED? TO THE PAY CUT DRIVING PAST ON DOUBLE. FEATURE WE ARE REMARKABLY REDUCE THE BURDEN OF PM PLEASE WORK. THOUGHT WHEN FOREIGNERS MOVED TO CALIFORNIA THEY NEED TO FACILITATE THE PROCESS OF THE STEP IN MONTH BY GETTING DEPRIVE WHAT'S LICENSE. IF THIS MUTUAL SYSTEM BECOMES IN THE FACT THEIR LIFE CAN BE MORE CONVENIENT AND THE CALIFORNIA CAN BE MORE ATTRACTIVE TO FOURTEEN VISITORS AND INVESTORS. FOR EXAMPLE KOREA IS THE SIXTH LARGEST TRADING PARTNER TO CALIFORNIA. AND THE THOUGHT BIGGEST PARKED NOT TO LOS ANGELES IF THIS BILL IS APPROVED. KOREAN PEOPLE AND COMPANY WILL FEEL THE CALIFORNIA CLOSER EMOTIONALLY AND PHYSICALLY. LAST BUT NOT LEAST. IT'S STILL MAINTAINS THE PARTY OF THE DRIVING SECURITY. BECAUSE IT IS NOT RELATED TO THE INSURANCE. STILL THE FORTY IN VISITOR IS REQUIRED TO ATTEND ON INSURANCE TO THRIVE OR RENTAL CAR. YOUR CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I RECEIVED THIRTY ONE SUPPORTER LETTERS FROM MANY KOREANS AND KOREAN GROUPS OR NEED. DURING ONLY FOR TWO DAYS. OKAY AS AN AMERICAN ONE THIS PROGRAM AND SUPPORTED. WE ALSO WISH THIS BILL PASSED IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THIS FLOOR. THANK YOU FOR THAT SIR. ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE AUTHORS BILL. MOVE THE BILL. ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL OR HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE AUTHORS BILL. THE STEP UP TO THE MIKE. I AM MY NAME IS KIM CHAMBERLAIN. I AM REPRESENTING KOREAN AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF A SHASTA. AND ALSO AMERICAN VETERANS ADVOCATE. I AM IN SUPPORT OF THE CASE BILLS. IVORY GEO TOOL CAST TO GOOD FOR TODAY. TO MAKE IT SO MANY KOREAN ARE PEOPLE WHO WILL BE SAID IT GOLDEN STATE THEIR LIFE MUCH EASIER. AND ALSO. CALIFORNIA WILL BENEFIT PUT THERE VISITING. AND DRIVING. A PRIVILEGE THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU MA'AM. SO WE'LL TRY IT ONE MORE TIME AS FAR AS FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO LIKE TO TRACK TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OR CONCERNS OF THE AUTHORS BILL. SEEING NONE. OF A BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE MISTER BIGELOW BEFORE QUESTIONS AND I AM. WHEN I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR THE? OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESSES BILL IN THE CHAIR. MY CONCERN -- MY QUESTION IS. WITH RESPECT TO THIS BILL IT IT RIVER REALLY REFERS TO A LIKE KIND. TYPE OF TESTING BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY ADDRESS THE FACT THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENCES. OF RULES OF THE ROAD. ON MEANING SEVENTY FIVE COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD DRIVE ON THE LEFT WHERE AS A HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DRIVE ON THE RIGHT. THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE AND THERE IS A CURVE CHANGE HOW DOES THIS BILL ANTICIPATE ADDRESSING THAT. THAT CHANGE FOR THOSE PEOPLE HAVE THE DIFFERENCE. TYPE OF LICENSING. FOR EXAMPLE IS THE PEOPLE WHO SPOKE HERE TODAY SPOKE FROM KOREA. AND THEY DRIVE ON THE RIGHT BUT WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE FROM THE U. K. AND MANY OF THESE OTHER COUNTRIES. THE SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR THE THE DRIVE ON THE LEFT AND WE SEEN MANY PEOPLE COME TO THIS COUNTRY. ACTUALLY HAVE ACCIDENTS WERE ACTUALLY I'VE BEEN ONE OF THOSE ATTENDING EMTS VOTE BECAUSE EIGHTY STE. LOST TRACK OF THEIR PRESENCE AND THREE DRIVING ON THE LEFT AGAIN. CALLING AHEAD ON SO HOW DO WE REMEDY THAT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ADDRESSING IT. WELL I THINK FIRST OF ALL WHETHER YOUR FROM OUR COUNTRY OR CALIFORNIA -- THAT WHETHER YOU. HAVE PASSED OUR TESTS THAT STILL DOESN'T. ELIMINATE ANY ACCIDENTS WE SEE MANY MANY AMERICANS IN ACCIDENTS EVERY DOWN BUT AS FAR AS FOREIGN COUNTRIES IT'S JUST IT'S LOOKING AT THE UNIFORMITY AMONG THE STANDARDS WHICH IS WHY THIS WAS BROUGHT. FOR FORWARD AS FAR AS MAKING SURE THERE'S AT LEAST A OF COMMON -- RULES TO THE ROAD IF YOU WANT TO SAY IT THAT WAY -- THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY SHOWING THAT THEY HAVE PASSED BY. GAINING THEIR LICENSE IN THE COUNTRY THAT THEY'RE AT BUT I DO AGREE WITH YOU THE RIGHT AND LEFT ON BUT IT IS LIKE WHEN WE GO TO ANOTHER COUNTRY. OURSELVES AND WE RENT A CAR THERE'S THERE'S OBVIOUSLY SOME DIFFERENCES BUT AS THOSE INDIVIDUALS GET INTO THE CAR RENT THE CAR SIGN ALL THE INSURANCE AGREEMENTS I THINK THEY ARE NOTING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE EXTREMELY. CAREFUL IN STARTING OUT. JUST LIKE A YOUNG DRIVER WOULD -- WHETHER THERE'S SIXTEEN OR EIGHTEEN SO DOES NOT ENSURE THAT THEY WOULD NEVER BE AN ACCIDENT BUT I THINK. THERE'S SOME ON BASIC -- AS WE SAY UNIFORMITY THAT WERE SEEN IN ALL COUNTRIES WITH DRIVING PRIME BUT AND I AGREE WITH THAT COMPONENT THE BASICS. WHAT I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT IS REALLY THE RULES OF THE ROAD WHICH THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES? OF FROM SIDE TO SIDE SO THAT THAT WAS MY REAL CONCERN WITH RESPECT TO THAT AS IT IS TODAY UNDER THE LAWS. WHETHER YOU'RE FROM OREGON NEVADA ARIZONA. AFTER YOU ESTABLISH RESIDENCY HERE IN. CALIFORNIA YOU HAVE TEN DAYS TO GET A DRIVER'S LICENSE AND BUT YOU HAVE A COMMONALITY OF YOUR ACCEPTED AND DEEMED TO HAVE HAD A TAKING A TEST. WHEN YOU GOT YOUR LICENSE OR SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE A DRIVING BUT IF YOU COME FROM MEXICO OR SOMEBODY THAT'S CLOSE TO US? THEN IT IS REQUIRED SO I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT I MY CONCERN IS THE RULES OF THE ROAD LONG TERM FROM. DIFFERENT COUNTRIES SO. THANK YOU THANK CRESCENTA MISTER BIGELOW I MIGHT ADD THOUGH IT FOR THEIR VISITING FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY THEY DON'T HAVE TO TAKE ANY TEST AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO START DRIVING RIGHT AWAY. AND SO IS THAT BEING SAID THIS ISN'T THIS ISN'T BACK AND FORTH -- SO THAT BEING SAID -- WHEN THEY BECOME A PERMANENT RESIDENT THAT'S WHEN THIS COMES IN EFFECT BUT THEY ALREADY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DRIVE OUR ROADS? REGARDLESS SO -- WITH THAT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. SEEING THEM ASSEMBLYMEMBER WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE I JUST I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU -- WITH THAT -- WE HAVE FIRST PLAYED A AND YOUR CURRY SECOND BY GRAYSON -- I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD.
