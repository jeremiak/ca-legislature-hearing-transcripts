00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:50.870
THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION THAT

00:07:50.937 --> 00:07:51.838
THE STUDENTS ARE RECEIVING. TO

00:07:51.904 --> 00:07:53.773

CYBER BULLYING WHICH WE KNOW IS

00:07:58.911 --> 00:08:01.080
HAVING A VERY SERIOUS IMPACT ON

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:01.881

00:08:01.948 --> 00:08:05.785
SO THAT IS A TWO HUNDRED FOUR

00:08:05.852 --> 00:08:06.519
THOUSAND DOLLAR ASK.

00:08:06.586 --> 00:08:08.054
THE SECOND ASK.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.089
IS THE TRIAL CARE COLLECTIVE

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:11.157
BARGAINING FUNDING.

00:08:11.224 --> 00:08:12.992
INEQUITIES THE WORKING FAMILIES

00:08:15.194 --> 00:08:16.829
OUR STATE'S EARLY CHILDHOOD

00:08:16.896 --> 00:08:19.298
EDUCATION SYSTEM WERE NEARLY 60%

00:08:19.365 --> 00:08:20.700

PAYING NEARLY 70% OF HER INCOME

00:08:30.476 --> 00:08:31.944
ONE CHILD CARE.

00:08:32.011 --> 00:08:32.979
THIS IS NOT SUSTAINABLE.

00:08:33.045 --> 00:08:34.247
IT'S NOT RIGHT AND I KNOW THE

00:08:34.313 --> 00:08:35.615
CALIFORNIA CAN AND MUST DO

00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:36.415
BETTER.

00:08:36.482 --> 00:08:38.017
SO THE RIGHT TO COLLECTIVE

00:08:38.084 --> 00:08:39.318
BARGAINING IS ALSO A MUST

00:08:39.385 --> 00:08:40.853
BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE ARE NO

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.154

00:09:31.737 --> 00:09:33.539
SHOCKINGLY THE STATE CURRENTLY

00:09:33.606 --> 00:09:35.007
DOESN'T COLLECT THIS INFORMATION

00:09:35.074 --> 00:09:36.776
WHICH IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT TO

TIME [inaudible]

00:26:43.601 --> 00:26:47.305
AND THERE'S ABOUT TWENTY FOUR

00:26:47.372 --> 00:26:48.473
BILLS I THINK THAT THE

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:50.508
LEGISLATURE IS IS CURRENTLY

00:26:50.575 --> 00:26:54.112
CONSIDERING AND WE'D WE'D LOVE

TO SEE IF THERE CAN BE A

00:26:55.513 --> 00:26:58.249
STRATEGIC APPROACH -- MAYBE SOME

00:26:58.316 --> 00:27:00.151
SORT OF A COMMISSION OR A TASK

00:27:00.218 --> 00:27:01.987
FORCE THAT REALLY DIVES DEEPLY

00:27:02.053 --> 00:27:03.288
INTO.

00:27:03.355 --> 00:27:05.824
YOU KNOW CHALLENGES THAT -- THAT

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:08.126
THAT WERE FACING -- WE REALLY

00:27:08.193 --> 00:27:09.361
BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM

00:27:09.427 --> 00:27:12.030
AND WE'RE SEEING EXTREME

00:27:12.097 --> 00:27:14.566
BEHAVIORS FROM YOUNGER AND

00:27:14.632 --> 00:27:15.667
YOUNGER STUDENTS SO MANY GIVE ME

00:27:15.734 --> 00:27:17.369
AN EXAMPLE OF A FIRST GRADE

00:27:17.435 --> 00:27:18.770
STUDENT IN MY SCHOOL DISTRICT

00:27:18.837 --> 00:27:20.939
THAT OCCURRED.

00:27:21.006 --> 00:27:22.774
IN THE LAST TEN DAYS.

00:27:22.841 --> 00:27:24.409
WITH THE STUDENT AT LUNCH

00:27:24.476 --> 00:27:26.611
EMPTIED OUT THEIR JUICE BOX.

00:27:26.678 --> 00:27:28.380
WENT TO THE RESTROOM URINATED IN

00:27:28.446 --> 00:27:29.948
THE JUICE BOX AND ATTEMPTED TO

00:27:30.015 --> 00:27:32.017
SERVE IT TO HIS FIRST GRADE

00:27:32.083 --> 00:27:34.319
CLASSMATES.

00:27:34.386 --> 00:27:36.554
SO WHAT YEAH FIRST GRADE SIX

00:27:36.621 --> 00:27:39.657
YEARS OLD.

00:27:39.724 --> 00:27:41.292
INTO THE THAT WELL THAT'S KIND

00:27:41.359 --> 00:27:44.195
OF AN EXTREME STORY.

00:27:44.262 --> 00:27:46.564
THE TEACHERS AND THE STAFF.

00:27:46.631 --> 00:27:48.733
WERE REALLY STRUGGLING WITH THE

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:52.303
TYPE OF TRAUMA WE BELIEVE THAT

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:54.472
THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE FACING AND

00:27:54.539 --> 00:27:55.940
HOME ENVIRONMENTS AND THEN OF

00:27:56.007 --> 00:27:57.208
COURSE.

00:27:57.275 --> 00:28:00.912
AS A PARTNER -- THE SCHOOLS --

00:28:00.979 --> 00:28:02.914
WHAT WE KIND OF USED TO SEE IN

00:28:02.981 --> 00:28:05.450
THE PAST THOSE SAME KINDS OF

00:28:05.517 --> 00:28:07.152
STRATEGIES THAT OUR TEACHERS AND

00:28:07.218 --> 00:28:08.787
OUR SUPPORT STAFF WERE USED TO

00:28:08.853 --> 00:28:10.755
DEALING THAT WOULD THAT WOULD

00:28:10.822 --> 00:28:13.658
ACTUALLY WORK -- WERE NO LONGER

00:28:13.725 --> 00:28:15.160
SEEING THOSE SAME STRATEGIES

00:28:15.226 --> 00:28:17.862
WORK WITH THE ADDITIONAL --

00:28:17.929 --> 00:28:19.431
TRAUMA THAT OUR STUDENTS SEEM TO

00:28:19.497 --> 00:28:21.599
BE BRINGING TO SCHOOL AND SO WE

00:28:21.666 --> 00:28:22.667
THINK THAT.

00:28:22.734 --> 00:28:24.436
THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME

00:28:24.502 --> 00:28:26.638
ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. TO TRAIN

00:28:26.704 --> 00:28:30.008
STAFF -- TO TO DEAL WITH THE

00:28:30.075 --> 00:28:31.743
CHALLENGES AND AND HELP OUR

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:34.312
STUDENTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN IN

00:28:34.379 --> 00:28:36.047
THE SCHOOL SETTING.

00:28:36.114 --> 00:28:39.451
AND SO -- WE HAVE A COUPLE OF A

00:28:39.517 --> 00:28:41.119
COUPLE OF BOX [inaudible]

00:28:41.186 --> 00:28:43.955
MANY AS WHEN FOSTER CARE STE.

00:28:44.022 --> 00:28:45.390
COME TO OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT OR

00:28:45.457 --> 00:28:48.193
CHANGE SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

00:28:48.259 --> 00:28:49.861
EVERYBODY GETS IN A TWIST OF

00:28:49.928 --> 00:28:51.463
THOSE STUDENTS ARE NOT ENROLLED

00:28:51.529 --> 00:28:55.233
WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS.

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:57.068
THE CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE IS

00:28:57.135 --> 00:28:58.937
VERY OFTEN TIMES THE STUDENTS

00:28:59.003 --> 00:29:01.239
ARE RECEIVING TREATMENT AND

00:29:01.306 --> 00:29:02.907
WRAPAROUND SERVICES.

00:29:02.974 --> 00:29:03.975
IN THEIR PREVIOUS SCHOOL

00:29:04.042 --> 00:29:06.077
DISTRICT.

00:29:06.144 --> 00:29:07.712
AND IN SOME CASES IT'S NOT HEARD

00:29:07.779 --> 00:29:10.048
OF THAT IT'S TWO THREE FOUR FIVE

00:29:10.115 --> 00:29:12.984
MONTHS.

00:29:13.051 --> 00:29:15.353
TRANSFERRED FROM THE THE

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:17.055
TRANSFERRING COUNTY. TO THE

00:29:17.122 --> 00:29:18.723
COUNTY THAT IS RECEIVING THE

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:21.759
STUDENT AND SO WHAT THAT MEANS.

00:29:21.826 --> 00:29:24.696
IS STUDENTS ARE COMING IN AND

00:29:24.762 --> 00:29:26.030
THE SERVICES THAT THEY USED TO

00:29:26.097 --> 00:29:28.466
RECEIVE ARE NOT FOLLOWING THEM

00:29:28.533 --> 00:29:30.001
IN A TIMELY FASHION.

00:29:30.068 --> 00:29:31.769
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY SOME OF THE

00:29:31.836 --> 00:29:33.705
MEDICATIONS THAT THEY WERE

00:29:33.771 --> 00:29:36.107
PRESCRIBED THE WERE THEY RUN OUT

00:29:36.174 --> 00:29:38.576
THE REFILL IS NOT AVAILABLE.

00:29:38.643 --> 00:29:39.878
AND SO NOW WE HAVE STUDENTS WHO

00:29:39.944 --> 00:29:42.247
ARE RECEIVING THE COUNSELING AND

00:29:42.313 --> 00:29:44.249
THERAPEUTIC SERVICES.

00:29:44.315 --> 00:29:46.317
AND THEY ALSO ARE RECEIVING --

00:29:46.384 --> 00:29:47.652
THE MET MEDICATION THAT'S BEEN

00:29:47.719 --> 00:29:49.454
PRESCRIBED BY THE MEDICAL

00:29:49.521 --> 00:29:50.255
PROFESSIONAL.

00:29:50.321 --> 00:29:52.457
AND YOUR RESPECTIVE OF YOUR

00:29:52.524 --> 00:29:54.192
PHILOSOPHY OR YOUR THOUGHTS ON

00:29:54.259 --> 00:29:57.162
MEDICATION FOR THESE THESE

00:29:57.228 --> 00:29:58.163
SERVICES.

00:29:58.229 --> 00:30:00.532
THE REALITY IS THAT THE SERVICES

00:30:00.598 --> 00:30:02.267
ARE NOT IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING

00:30:02.333 --> 00:30:05.436
THE STUDENTS IN A TIMELY FASHION.

00:30:05.503 --> 00:30:06.504
SO.

00:30:06.571 --> 00:30:08.306
THAT'S THAT'S ONE THING FOR YOUR

00:30:08.373 --> 00:30:09.974
CONSIDERATION -- THE OTHER THING

00:30:10.041 --> 00:30:12.010
THAT THAT WE THINK IS IMPORTANT

00:30:12.076 --> 00:30:13.545
FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.

00:30:13.611 --> 00:30:15.280
IS THAT SOCIAL EMOTIONAL

00:30:15.346 --> 00:30:18.616
LEARNING BE PART OF TEACHER

00:30:18.683 --> 00:30:20.585
TRAINING PROGRAMS YOU KNOW START

00:30:20.652 --> 00:30:23.454
AND THAT'S KIND OF THE LONG GAME --

00:30:23.521 --> 00:30:25.190
BUT WE THINK THAT IF TEACHERS

00:30:25.256 --> 00:30:26.491
ARE COMING INTO THE PUBLIC

00:30:26.558 --> 00:30:27.792
SCHOOL SETTING AND THEY'VE HAD

00:30:27.859 --> 00:30:30.061
SOME INSTRUCTION.

00:30:30.128 --> 00:30:32.197
IN SOME DISCUSSIONS AND SOME

00:30:32.263 --> 00:30:34.199
ABILITY TO LEARN SOMETHING MORE

00:30:34.265 --> 00:30:36.167
ABOUT SUPPORTING STUDENTS

00:30:36.234 --> 00:30:37.535
THROUGH SOCIAL EMOTIONAL

00:30:37.602 --> 00:30:39.504
LEARNING PROGRAMS WHEN THEY

00:30:39.571 --> 00:30:41.673
ARRIVE INTO OUR SCHOOLS WE THINK

00:30:41.739 --> 00:30:43.341
THAT WOULD BE.

00:30:43.408 --> 00:30:44.909
EXTREMELY HELPFUL.

00:30:44.976 --> 00:30:46.411
JUST THE FINAL THING I'D LIKE TO

00:30:46.477 --> 00:30:47.912

00:30:47.979 --> 00:30:49.514

AND WE'RE HERE TO SHARE AND

00:30:59.791 --> 00:31:01.626
COLLABORATE IN ANY WAY THAT

00:31:01.693 --> 00:31:03.061
MAKES SENSE.

00:31:03.127 --> 00:31:05.196
WE BELIEVE THIS IS A REALLY

00:31:05.263 --> 00:31:06.464
IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT ARE

00:31:06.531 --> 00:31:10.134

ALTERNATIVE EDUCATION SITES SO

00:31:36.494 --> 00:31:37.629

ALTERNATIVE EDUCATION SITE

00:32:58.443 --> 00:33:00.144
BECAUSE I THINK THE ALTERNATIVE

00:33:00.211 --> 00:33:02.046

THAT IS ENHANCE AND THE SYSTEM

00:49:14.584 --> 00:49:16.119
OF CAE THAT WE HAD AT THIS HIGH

00:49:16.186 --> 00:49:17.220

00:49:27.297 --> 00:49:30.334
AND CREATE AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM.

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:32.302
WITHIN A SQUALL WHERE WE CAN

00:49:32.369 --> 00:49:35.072
LEARN THE THE PROJECT IS

00:49:35.138 --> 00:49:36.673
ORGANIZED AROUND BEING A

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:37.874
DEMONSTRATION PRODUCT.

00:49:37.941 --> 00:49:40.544
OF PROJECT SO WE CAN LEARN HOW

00:49:40.610 --> 00:49:42.279
DO WE COMMUNICATE.

00:49:42.346 --> 00:49:44.581
WE HAVE BETWEEN HAPPEN FOR PA --

00:49:44.648 --> 00:49:46.683
HOW DO WE SET UP A SYSTEM WHERE

00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:49.152
WE CAN HAVE REGULAR ROUTINE TEAM

00:49:49.219 --> 00:49:51.154
MADE ENDS HOW DO WE CREATE A NOT

00:49:51.221 --> 00:49:52.856
JUST A WELLNESS CENTER AT A

00:49:52.923 --> 00:49:54.691
SCHOOL SITE BUT A WELLNESS?

00:49:54.758 --> 00:49:57.060
CAMPUS WITH PARTNERS.

00:49:57.127 --> 00:49:58.695
AND WE'RE FORTUNATE TO HAVE THIS

00:49:58.762 --> 00:50:00.263
OPPORTUNITY THROUGH THE

00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:01.598
COMMISSION TO DO THAT.

00:50:01.665 --> 00:50:04.401
BUT I CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH TO

00:50:04.468 --> 00:50:06.570
STRATEGIES AND AND WE JANET

00:50:06.636 --> 00:50:08.238
ACTUALLY MEET BEFORE TODAY.

00:50:08.305 --> 00:50:09.473
THAT MY COLLEAGUES TO THE LEFT

00:50:09.539 --> 00:50:11.942
TALKED ABOUT IS THAT WE DO THAT

00:50:12.008 --> 00:50:13.643
AND AND NOT JUST AN INTEGRATED

00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:15.712
WAY BUT THAT WE USE MULTI TIERED

00:50:15.779 --> 00:50:18.248
SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT. TO LOOK AT

00:50:18.315 --> 00:50:21.017
HOW WE SCAFFOLD THOSE SUPPORTS

00:50:21.084 --> 00:50:22.519
TERRACE SCHOOL SITE.

00:50:22.586 --> 00:50:24.254
AND THAT WE USE A FRAMEWORK OF

00:50:24.321 --> 00:50:26.189
POSITIVE BEHAVIOR INTERVENTIONS

00:50:26.256 --> 00:50:28.358
AND SUPPORTS SO THAT WE CAN

00:50:28.425 --> 00:50:31.094
GROUND AND SUPPORT STUDENTS AT A

00:50:31.161 --> 00:50:32.963
SCHOOL SITE.

00:50:33.029 --> 00:50:33.797
HELPING STUDENTS WHO HAVE AN

00:50:33.864 --> 00:50:35.298
RECEIVE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL

00:50:35.365 --> 00:50:37.234
LEARNING AND OR DON'T UNDERSTAND

00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:39.069
THE SOCIAL SKILLS THEY NEED TO

00:50:39.136 --> 00:50:40.771
NAVIGATE.

00:50:40.837 --> 00:50:41.872
SO I THINK A LOT OF TIMES

00:50:41.938 --> 00:50:43.173
WITHOUT D. V. I. S. AT A SCHOOL

00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:46.376
SITE WE TEND -- TO END OF

00:50:46.443 --> 00:50:47.644
CORRUPTION THE DATA BECAUSE

00:50:47.711 --> 00:50:48.912
CHILDREN COME FROM SO MANY

00:50:48.979 --> 00:50:50.480
DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS WE DON'T

00:50:50.547 --> 00:50:52.649
EVEN KNOW IF THEY WERE TAUGHT --

00:50:52.716 --> 00:51:00.590
BASIC SOCIAL PROTOCOLS AND

00:51:00.657 --> 00:51:01.625
RESPONSIBILITIES SO.

00:51:01.691 --> 00:51:02.692
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A

00:51:02.759 --> 00:51:04.261
SOLID FRAMEWORK THAT WE SCAFFOLD.

00:51:04.327 --> 00:51:05.429
THE TYPES OF SUPPORTS THAT THEY

00:51:05.495 --> 00:51:06.696
TALKED ABOUT TO SOCIAL EMOTIONAL

00:51:06.763 --> 00:51:08.432
LEARNING MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTS

00:51:08.498 --> 00:51:09.199
IN AN EFFECTIVE WAY.

00:51:09.266 --> 00:51:11.668
THAT'S EVIDENCE BASED AND DRIVEN

00:51:11.735 --> 00:51:13.170
BY DATA.

00:51:13.236 --> 00:51:15.739
WE'RE NOT JUST REACT IN ALWAYS

00:51:15.806 --> 00:51:16.406

00:51:16.473 --> 00:51:17.774

I WHEN WHEN HONESTLY IT'S

00:51:22.546 --> 00:51:23.780
CHEAPER.

00:51:23.847 --> 00:51:25.615
IT'S MORE EFFECTIVE AND IT'S

00:51:25.682 --> 00:51:26.983
MORE FAMILY FRIENDLY.

00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:29.219
THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IS ABOUT

00:51:29.286 --> 00:51:32.722
FAMILIES WE NEED AN EDUCATION.

00:51:32.789 --> 00:51:35.192

ARE YOU SAYING THAT.

00:55:52.982 --> 00:55:54.984

OR DIRECTLY TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:56:01.658 --> 00:56:02.892
THAT WE'RE SOMEHOW PROHIBITED

00:56:02.959 --> 00:56:04.994
FROM USING THE PROP SIXTY THREE

ORGANIZED IT IN DIFFERENT WAYS.

IN SOME COUNTIES AS DRIVEN

00:56:22.278 --> 00:56:24.214
THROUGH MORE OF A CLINICAL MODEL

00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:26.382
WHERE STUDENTS WILL GO TO A

00:56:26.449 --> 00:56:27.984
CLINIC AND RECEIVE.

00:56:28.051 --> 00:56:29.719
THOSE SERVICES -- TO AN EXAMPLE

00:56:29.786 --> 00:56:31.688
MIGHT BE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

00:56:31.755 --> 00:56:34.023
AN INCREDIBLE YEARS PROGRAM

00:56:34.090 --> 00:56:35.492
THAT'S SUPPORT AND YOUNG

00:56:35.558 --> 00:56:38.161
STUDENTS -- TYPICALLY CAVE

00:56:38.228 --> 00:56:39.562
THROUGH THIRD GRADE BUT THAT

00:56:39.629 --> 00:56:41.798
MIGHT NOT BE HAPPEN AND AT THE

00:56:41.865 --> 00:56:45.201
SCHOOL SITE.

00:56:45.268 --> 00:56:47.036
HOW HOW DOES THAT STUDENT IN?

00:56:47.103 --> 00:56:48.638
HOW'S THAT STUDENT IN IDENTIFIED.

00:56:48.705 --> 00:56:49.606
AND HOW DOES THE STUDENT GET TO

00:56:49.672 --> 00:56:50.974
THE CLINICAL SIDE [inaudible]

00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:53.710
IN SUCH.

00:56:53.777 --> 00:56:55.445
THE MOST TRAGIC IN CATASTROPHIC

00:56:55.512 --> 00:56:57.313
ONES WHERE WE HAVE A SUICIDAL

00:56:57.380 --> 00:57:00.150
STUDENT TOURS SOMEONE WHO'S AN

00:57:00.216 --> 00:57:02.318
EXTREME DISTRESS AND THAT'S THE

00:57:02.385 --> 00:57:04.087
OPPORTUNITY UNDER THIS SHIFT

00:57:04.154 --> 00:57:06.823
WHERE SAN SINCE AB.

00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:08.424
ONE FOURTEEN IS TO HELP SCHOOLS

00:57:08.491 --> 00:57:09.626
I UNDERSTAND THE TYPES OF

00:57:09.692 --> 00:57:11.394
INDIVIDUALS THAT WE NEED ON

00:57:11.461 --> 00:57:14.097
CAMPUS AND HOW DO PARTNER WITH

00:57:14.164 --> 00:57:15.865
OUR MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS.

00:57:15.932 --> 00:57:18.401
IN MOVE AND SO THE THE INSTANCE

00:57:18.468 --> 00:57:19.936
I GAVE IN PLASTER COUNTY.

00:57:20.003 --> 00:57:21.404
WE WORKING WITH BEHAVIORAL

00:57:21.471 --> 00:57:22.839
HEALTH UNDER THE MENTAL HEALTH

00:57:22.906 --> 00:57:25.208
SERVICES ACT USE THOSE DOLLARS

00:57:25.275 --> 00:57:27.644
TO PLANTS INCREDIBLE YEARS

00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:29.979
PROGRAMS DIRECTLY ON A SCHOOL

00:57:30.046 --> 00:57:31.548
SITE CAMPUS.

00:57:31.614 --> 00:57:32.682
SO FOR PLASTER COUNTY WE TAKE

00:57:32.749 --> 00:57:35.485
THOSE PROGRAMS INCREDIBLE YEARS --

00:57:35.552 --> 00:57:37.287
THINGS LIKE FUNCTIONAL FAMILY

00:57:37.353 --> 00:57:38.822
THERAPY AND WE CREATE A STRONGER

00:57:38.888 --> 00:57:40.456
AND ACCESS DIRECTLY TO THE

00:57:40.523 --> 00:57:41.658
SCHOOL SITE.

00:57:41.724 --> 00:57:42.992
AND I THINK WHAT I'M SAYING

00:57:43.059 --> 00:57:44.961
ACROSS THE STATE IS A SHIFT IN

00:57:45.028 --> 00:57:47.397
THAT DIRECTION.

00:57:47.463 --> 00:57:48.097
I WAS LIKE A LESSER COUNTY IS

00:57:48.164 --> 00:57:52.001
WILLING TO USE THE PROP SIXTY

00:57:52.068 --> 00:57:53.336
THREE MONEY. FOR THE PURPOSE ONE

00:57:53.403 --> 00:57:55.004
OF THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH IT WAS

00:57:55.071 --> 00:57:56.206
INTENDED TO ROLL MENTAL HEALTH

00:57:56.272 --> 00:57:58.341
SERVICES OUT.

00:57:58.408 --> 00:57:58.975
TO INTO THE COMMUNITY INCLUDING

00:57:59.042 --> 00:58:00.476
INTO ART SCHOOL.

00:58:00.543 --> 00:58:01.878
YES YES VERY MUCH IN THE NOT

00:58:01.945 --> 00:58:04.147
SURE THAT'S THE CASE IN OTHER

00:58:04.214 --> 00:58:04.981
COUNTY I'M GONNA SUGGEST THAT.

00:58:05.048 --> 00:58:07.851
THAT IS NOT MY EXPERIENCE --

00:58:07.917 --> 00:58:09.986
THAT WE WE HAVE NOT SEEN THOSE

00:58:10.053 --> 00:58:12.922
DOLLARS AND THAT'S WHY THERE'S A

00:58:12.989 --> 00:58:14.991
HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION

00:58:15.058 --> 00:58:16.359
OR HUNDRED THIRTY SIX BILLION IN

00:58:16.426 --> 00:58:20.830
THE AND THE ORIGIN -- IN THE IN

00:58:20.897 --> 00:58:22.031
A HOT YEAH.

00:58:22.098 --> 00:58:22.866
SO I WHAT WHAT WHAT WE'VE DONE

00:58:22.932 --> 00:58:24.667
IS WE'VE USED A PORTION OF OUR

00:58:24.734 --> 00:58:26.236
LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA

00:58:26.302 --> 00:58:28.238
DOLLARS THROUGH OUR LOCAL

00:58:28.304 --> 00:58:30.139
CONTROL AND ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN.

00:58:30.206 --> 00:58:32.141
TO FUND ADDITIONAL MENTAL HEALTH

00:58:32.208 --> 00:58:35.144
SERVICES THROUGH OUR EL CAP.

00:58:35.211 --> 00:58:37.580
AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE TODAY

00:58:37.647 --> 00:58:41.384
IS WE'VE HIRED -- WE HAVE

00:58:41.451 --> 00:58:43.953
EIGHTEEN MENTAL HEALTH IN EARNS.

00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:47.457
WHO ARE GUIDED BY A LICENSED

00:58:47.523 --> 00:58:49.359
MARRIAGE FAMILY COUNSELOR UNDER

00:58:49.425 --> 00:58:51.594
THEIR LICENSE AS THEY ARE

00:58:51.661 --> 00:58:53.830
LEARNING AND SO THESE ARE?

00:58:53.897 --> 00:58:55.598
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE WORKING

00:58:55.665 --> 00:58:57.400
THROUGH THEIR PROGRAM.

00:58:57.467 --> 00:58:58.701
AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO STAFF

00:58:58.768 --> 00:59:00.970
ORDERS PAID THEY ARE PAID

00:59:01.037 --> 00:59:02.939
INTERNSHIPS SO SO IT'S SO.

00:59:03.006 --> 00:59:04.240
IT'S SOMEONE IS WORKING TOWARD A

00:59:04.307 --> 00:59:05.541
LICENSE CLINIC TOWARDS THEIR

00:59:05.608 --> 00:59:08.411
TOWARDS OUR FULL LICENSE AND WE

00:59:08.478 --> 00:59:09.345
WE WE PAY THEM.

00:59:09.412 --> 00:59:10.780
BASICALLY ENOUGH MONEY TO COVER

00:59:10.847 --> 00:59:12.181
THEIR GAS.

00:59:12.248 --> 00:59:13.349
IS HOW IT WORKS AND THAT AND

00:59:13.416 --> 00:59:14.951
THAT'S REALLY UNFORTUNATE BUT ON

00:59:15.018 --> 00:59:16.920
THE OTHER SIDE THE VALUE THAT

00:59:16.986 --> 00:59:18.254
THEY ADD.

00:59:18.321 --> 00:59:20.924
I JUST MET WITH OUR PRINCIPLES.

00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:22.025
THAT ARE TWELVE ELEMENTARY

00:59:22.091 --> 00:59:23.726
SCHOOL SITES WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO

00:59:23.793 --> 00:59:25.094
STAFF.

00:59:25.161 --> 00:59:28.364
AT TWO POINT FIVE DAYS A WEEK

00:59:28.431 --> 00:59:28.665
[inaudible]

00:59:28.731 --> 00:59:31.534
AND THE VALUE THAT THEY'RE

00:59:31.601 --> 00:59:34.337
BRINGING TO OUR STUDENTS AND THE

00:59:34.404 --> 00:59:36.105
STAFF THE PRINCIPLE THAT

00:59:36.172 --> 00:59:38.207
TEACHERS AT THOSE SITES BY BY

00:59:38.274 --> 00:59:39.575
BEING ABLE.

00:59:39.642 --> 00:59:42.645
TO PROVIDE THERAPEUTIC SERVICES

00:59:42.712 --> 00:59:44.280
FOR OUR STUDENTS HAS BEEN

00:59:44.347 --> 00:59:45.581
SIGNIFICANT.

00:59:45.648 --> 00:59:47.283
THE DIFFERENCE THAT I SEE IS

00:59:47.350 --> 00:59:49.686
THAT OUR SCHOOL COUNSELORS WELL

00:59:49.752 --> 00:59:53.222
THEY ARE EXTREMELY VALUABLE.

00:59:53.289 --> 00:59:54.757
WE'RE MOVING INTO A SITUATION

00:59:54.824 --> 00:59:56.526
WHERE.

00:59:56.592 --> 00:59:58.461
WE REALLY NEED THE MENTAL HEALTH

00:59:58.528 --> 01:00:01.631
PROFESSIONAL WHO CAN PROVIDE NOT

01:00:01.698 --> 01:00:03.499
SIMPLY COUNSELING SERVICES BUT

01:00:03.566 --> 01:00:06.169
THERAPEUTIC SERVICES AND FOR US

01:00:06.235 --> 01:00:07.537
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE.

01:00:07.603 --> 01:00:08.838
AND THE OTHER POINT I WOULD MAKE

01:00:08.905 --> 01:00:09.973
IS THAT.

01:00:10.039 --> 01:00:11.674
WELL WE DO HAVE COMMUNITY BASED

01:00:11.741 --> 01:00:13.609
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE THAT ARE

01:00:13.676 --> 01:00:15.311
THERE AND AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE

01:00:15.378 --> 01:00:17.380
THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:20.516
THAT IS NOT ACCESSIBLE IN ALL

01:00:20.583 --> 01:00:21.617
SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

01:00:21.684 --> 01:00:23.987
IN SO FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF MY

01:00:24.053 --> 01:00:25.688
SUPERINTENDENT COLLEAGUES HAS A

01:00:25.755 --> 01:00:27.991
SCHOOL DISTRICT OF THREE HUNDRED

01:00:28.057 --> 01:00:29.092
EIGHTY SIX STUDENTS.

01:00:29.158 --> 01:00:31.094
IN ORDER TO GET THIS THE STUDENT

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:32.929
WHO IN NEEDS THERAPEUTIC

01:00:32.996 --> 01:00:34.897
SERVICES THEY HAVE TO TAKE A TWO

01:00:34.964 --> 01:00:36.165
HOUR BUS RIDE.

01:00:36.232 --> 01:00:38.468
UP FROM THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO

01:00:38.534 --> 01:00:40.103
THE SERVICES AND BACK.

01:00:40.169 --> 01:00:43.373
IN SO MY THINKING IS THAT IF THE

01:00:43.439 --> 01:00:46.275
DOLLARS ARE MOVING MORE TOWARDS

01:00:46.342 --> 01:00:47.844
WHERE THE WHERE THE CHILDREN ARE

01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:51.314
LOCATED -- THE SERVICES CAN BE

01:00:51.381 --> 01:00:52.648
MORE ON DEMAND.

01:00:52.715 --> 01:00:55.018
HAVE YOU MADE AN ATTEMPT TO

01:00:55.084 --> 01:00:56.686
ACCESS THE PROP SIXTY THREE

01:00:56.753 --> 01:00:57.887
FUNDING THROUGH THE COUNTY

01:00:57.954 --> 01:01:00.356
PROCESS WE NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE --

01:01:00.423 --> 01:01:02.358
WE WE HAVE I WOULD SAY WE HAVE

01:01:02.425 --> 01:01:03.793
NOT.

01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:04.560
AND THEN LET ME I DON'T WANT TO

01:01:04.627 --> 01:01:06.662
CUT THIS DISCUSSION UP BECAUSE I

01:01:06.729 --> 01:01:07.797
THINK IT'S VALUABLE BUT I ALSO

01:01:07.864 --> 01:01:08.531
WANT.

01:01:08.598 --> 01:01:09.766
TO THROW ANOTHER QUESTION IN MY

01:01:09.832 --> 01:01:10.266
COLLEAGUES MAY HAVE SOME

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:13.136
QUESTIONS.

01:01:13.202 --> 01:01:14.470
PERSONS IS THE MEDICAL

01:01:14.537 --> 01:01:16.606
REIMBURSEMENT PROCESS THAT UNDER

01:01:16.672 --> 01:01:19.075
CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES -- SCHOOL

01:01:19.142 --> 01:01:21.210
SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN CONFIRM CAN

01:01:21.277 --> 01:01:22.545
I ASSUME COUNTY OFFICES CAN

01:01:22.612 --> 01:01:25.181
FOLLOW TO RECOUP SOME OF THE

01:01:25.248 --> 01:01:26.516
COST OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.

01:01:26.582 --> 01:01:29.052
HAVE YOU ATTEMPTED THAT AND HAVE

01:01:29.118 --> 01:01:30.820
THERE BEEN CHALLENGES IN DOING

01:01:30.887 --> 01:01:32.488
SO YES AND YES.

01:01:32.555 --> 01:01:35.291
SO OUR NORMAL SCHOOL COUNSELORS

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:37.927
HAVE A P. P. S. C. CREDENTIALED

01:01:37.994 --> 01:01:39.529
PEOPLE PERSONAL SERVICES

01:01:39.595 --> 01:01:40.630
CREDENTIAL.

01:01:40.696 --> 01:01:43.299
THEY CANNOT BILL FOR MEDI CAL

01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:46.803
REIMBURSEMENT IN THEIR ROLE.

01:01:46.869 --> 01:01:48.037
AND AND THIS IS I'M BEING I'M

01:01:48.104 --> 01:01:50.339
BEING TOLD THIS BY I JUST MET

01:01:50.406 --> 01:01:53.376
WITH ALL OF MY FOLKS BEFORE.

01:01:53.443 --> 01:01:54.444
YOU KNOW ARRIVING HERE IN

01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:56.212
SACRAMENTO.

01:01:56.279 --> 01:01:57.046
AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THEY'RE

01:01:57.113 --> 01:01:59.315
THEY'RE SUGGESTING IS SOME SORT

01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:01.851
OF A STATUTORY CHANGE THAT WILL

01:02:01.918 --> 01:02:04.020
ALLOW THEM TO BILL FOR DIRECT

01:02:04.087 --> 01:02:05.922
MEDI CAL SERVICES AS A SCHOOL

01:02:05.988 --> 01:02:07.023
COUNSELOR.

01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:09.025
NOW OUR MENTAL HEALTH THERAPISTS

01:02:09.092 --> 01:02:11.761
ARE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST THEY CAN

01:02:11.828 --> 01:02:13.362
BUILD DIRECTLY.

01:02:13.429 --> 01:02:16.466
AND I I THAT THAT TO ME IS IS

01:02:16.532 --> 01:02:17.767
SOMETHING THAT THERE MAY BE A

01:02:17.834 --> 01:02:20.636
GAP -- FOR AND AND I THINK THIS

01:02:20.703 --> 01:02:22.405
IS WHAT YOU ALSO ALLUDED TO THAT

01:02:22.472 --> 01:02:25.108
THERE'S THERE'S DIFFERENT.

01:02:25.174 --> 01:02:26.242
LICENSING.

01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:28.511
AND CREDENTIALING AND WHAT THE

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:30.513
LICENSING AND CREDENTIALED STAFF

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:33.382
CAN DO AND BILL FOR IS NOT IN

01:02:33.449 --> 01:02:35.618
COHERENCE WITH ONE ANOTHER.

01:02:35.685 --> 01:02:37.420
WHICH DOESN'T NECESSARILY

01:02:37.487 --> 01:02:40.323
SUPPORT THE NEEDS OF THE STUDENT.

01:02:40.389 --> 01:02:41.224
I THINK IT'S VERY I MEAN I'M NOT

01:02:41.290 --> 01:02:43.893
A EDUCATOR AND I'M NOT A

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:45.128
HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS CERTAINLY

01:02:45.194 --> 01:02:45.928
NOT A MENTAL HEALTH CARE

01:02:45.995 --> 01:02:48.264
PROVIDER BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT.

01:02:48.331 --> 01:02:49.866
THE THAT THE CORE OF ALL THIS IS

01:02:49.932 --> 01:02:52.535
VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE SOME.

01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:54.270
POINT OF CONTACT ON A SCHOOL

01:02:54.337 --> 01:02:57.039
CAMPUS WHO CAN AT LEAST DO THE

01:02:57.106 --> 01:03:00.409
INITIAL -- WHO CONTACT TRIAGE

01:03:00.476 --> 01:03:02.078
AND IN APPROPRIATE CASES MOVE

01:03:02.145 --> 01:03:03.446
THIS IF THE STUDENT IS AN

01:03:03.513 --> 01:03:05.081
EXTREME SITUATION MOVE THEM TO A

01:03:05.148 --> 01:03:07.750
CLINICAL SETTING BUT IF NOT?

01:03:07.817 --> 01:03:10.119
ADDRESS SOME OF THE COMMENTS AND

01:03:10.186 --> 01:03:12.188
CONCERNS THAT WE THAT ARE

01:03:12.255 --> 01:03:13.923
REFLECTED IN THE NOTES -- THAT

01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:15.324
WERE PRESENTED IN THIS HANDOUT I

01:03:15.391 --> 01:03:17.560
THINK THAT'S WHY THIS PROJECT

01:03:17.627 --> 01:03:19.128
WAS SO PER PERFECT TO FALL

01:03:19.195 --> 01:03:20.863
UNDERNEATH THE MENTAL HEALTH

01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:23.199
SERVICE ACT TRIAGE DOLLARS.

01:03:23.266 --> 01:03:25.001
THE OTHER PART OF WHAT WE'RE

01:03:25.067 --> 01:03:26.502
TRYING TO HELP DISTRICTS

01:03:26.569 --> 01:03:28.971
UNDERSTAND AND LEARN OURSELVES

01:03:29.038 --> 01:03:30.506
AND IMPROVE IN THIS PROCESS.

01:03:30.573 --> 01:03:36.045
IS THE IDEA OF RATED OR BLENDED

01:03:36.112 --> 01:03:37.980
FUND.

01:03:38.047 --> 01:03:39.182
SO WHILE CERTAIN STAFF CAN'T YOU

01:03:39.248 --> 01:03:39.849
KNOW THE THE LAW REQUIRES

01:03:39.916 --> 01:03:41.651
CERTAIN TYPES OF STAFF TO DO

01:03:41.717 --> 01:03:42.251
CERTAIN TYPES OF FELL IN THE

01:03:42.318 --> 01:03:43.219
NEXT SATURDAY IT'S A VERY

01:03:43.286 --> 01:03:44.520
COMPLICATED LAW ONE THING WE CAN

01:03:44.587 --> 01:03:47.056
DO IS MAKE.

01:03:47.123 --> 01:03:50.560
THOSE ROLES LESS COMPLICATED.

01:03:50.626 --> 01:03:51.694
YEAH UNTIL THEN HOW DO WE

01:03:51.761 --> 01:03:53.396
SUPPORT DISTRICTS AND UNDERSTAND

01:03:53.462 --> 01:03:56.165
AND ABRADED FUND AND MODEL.

01:03:56.232 --> 01:03:58.201
WHERE EVERYBODY CAN BRING THEIR

01:03:58.267 --> 01:04:00.336
FUNDING SOURCES TO TO THE TABLE

01:04:00.403 --> 01:04:01.604
PLASTERS THERE ON HAT IN SOME

01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:03.806
DEGREE I THINK MONTEREY COUNTY

01:04:03.873 --> 01:04:07.643
IS ALSO AND EXCELLENT EXAMPLE?

01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:09.345
WITH A AMY MILLER HER LEADERSHIP

01:04:09.412 --> 01:04:11.013
THAT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKING

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:13.282
WITH ACCOUNTING OFFICE TO LOOK

01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:15.117
AT HOWEVER HOW CAN WE SPEND

01:04:15.184 --> 01:04:16.686
THESE DOLLARS.

01:04:16.752 --> 01:04:22.325
HOW CAN WE PUSH THEM INTO?

01:04:22.391 --> 01:04:24.794
GATHERS SO WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:29.498
LC -- FAST MEDI CAL EDUCATION MA

01:04:29.565 --> 01:04:35.471
RELATED MEDICO OPTIONS TOGETHER.

01:04:35.538 --> 01:04:36.272
TO MAYBE IN A NOT SHOW AND I

01:04:36.339 --> 01:04:36.939
KNOW YOU'VE COVERED THIS BUT HOW

01:04:37.006 --> 01:04:38.007
IS IT THAT YOU HAVE BEEN

01:04:38.074 --> 01:04:39.008
RELATIVELY SUCCESSFUL IF NOT

01:04:39.075 --> 01:04:40.910
VERY SUCCESSFUL.

01:04:40.977 --> 01:04:42.745
IN TAPPING INTO THE MIDDLE OF

01:04:42.812 --> 01:04:45.214
SERVICES ACT PROP.

01:04:45.281 --> 01:04:47.049
SIXTY THREE MONEY IS A BECAUSE

01:04:47.116 --> 01:04:50.987
YOU SAID ON THE LOCAL BOARD.

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:53.656
PARTLY YES SO IN PLASTER COUNTY

01:04:53.723 --> 01:04:55.191
WE HAVE A MONTHLY.

01:04:55.258 --> 01:04:57.093
MEET AND A LOOK AT OUR OUR

01:04:57.159 --> 01:04:58.594
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THE

01:04:58.661 --> 01:05:00.796
COUNTY IT'S COMMUNITY

01:05:00.863 --> 01:05:02.164
COLLABORATIVE ME THEN.

01:05:02.231 --> 01:05:04.133
THAT COLLABORATIVE DRIVE SOME OF

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:05.835
THE DECISION MAKING AROUND OR

01:05:05.901 --> 01:05:07.003
MENTAL HEALTH DOLLARS.

01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:09.038
ALSO I THINK BECAUSE WE HAVE A

01:05:09.105 --> 01:05:11.641
HISTORY OF AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM.

01:05:11.707 --> 01:05:13.276
PRIOR TO EDUCATION I USED TO BE

01:05:13.342 --> 01:05:14.944
THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR FOR OUR

01:05:15.011 --> 01:05:17.146
SYSTEM OF CARE BEFORE MOVING TO

01:05:17.213 --> 01:05:18.648
THE COUNTY OFFICE.

01:05:18.714 --> 01:05:20.816
SO THE IDEA OF HAVE AND I

01:05:20.883 --> 01:05:24.487
SYSTEMS OF CARE MODEL.

01:05:24.553 --> 01:05:26.055
NOT AT THE COUNTY LEVEL OR THAT

01:05:26.122 --> 01:05:27.857
COLLABORATION EVEN AT THE STATE

01:05:27.923 --> 01:05:30.693
LEVEL BETWEEN DEPARTMENTS COULD

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.228
RESOLVE SOME OF THE FUNDING

01:05:32.295 --> 01:05:34.196
NEEDS AND AND BARRIERS AT ARMS

01:05:34.263 --> 01:05:34.930
PLACE.

01:05:34.997 --> 01:05:36.932
OVER THAT COLLABORATION DOWN TO

01:05:36.999 --> 01:05:40.536
REGION ALL AND COUNTY LEVELS

01:05:40.603 --> 01:05:41.804
WHERE WE ME.

01:05:41.871 --> 01:05:43.739
EVERY OTHER WEDNESDAY AS I

01:05:43.806 --> 01:05:45.174
COUNTY LEADERSHIP GROUP TO LOOK

01:05:45.241 --> 01:05:47.043
AT ALL KINDS OF CHALLENGES FOR

01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:48.611
PLASTER COUNTY FROM CHILD

01:05:48.678 --> 01:05:50.112
WELFARE TO MENTAL HEALTH.

01:05:50.179 --> 01:05:53.215
THE FUNDING CHALLENGES PROBATION.

01:05:53.282 --> 01:05:54.950
OUR PROBATION DEPARTMENT FUNDS A

01:05:55.017 --> 01:05:57.420
SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL THIRTY

01:05:57.486 --> 01:05:58.554
DAY.

01:05:58.621 --> 01:06:01.357
CRISIS CENTER OUT OF PREVENTION

01:06:01.424 --> 01:06:01.957
DAHLE.

01:06:02.024 --> 01:06:02.992
WHICH I THINK IS PRETTY UNHEARD

01:06:03.059 --> 01:06:04.360
OF AS WELL.

01:06:04.427 --> 01:06:07.563
SO THE IDEA OF OF BRING AND YOU

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:08.831
PEOPLE USE THE METAPHOR OF YOUR

01:06:08.898 --> 01:06:11.367
YOUR TOYS TO THE SANDBOX OR

01:06:11.434 --> 01:06:12.868
PUTTING YOUR MONEY ALL THE MONEY

01:06:12.935 --> 01:06:14.070
ON THE TABLE AND YOUR HANDS

01:06:14.136 --> 01:06:15.871
BEHIND YOUR BACK AND HOW CAN WE

01:06:15.938 --> 01:06:17.306
SERVE OUR KIDS.

01:06:17.373 --> 01:06:20.843
IN A MORE -- LEADERSHIP MODEL OR

01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:23.212
DO LEADERSHIP DRIVEN MODEL -- IT

01:06:23.279 --> 01:06:24.880
TAKES SOME COURAGE FROM PEOPLE

01:06:24.947 --> 01:06:27.550
LIKE -- OUR DEPARTMENT HAS OR

01:06:27.616 --> 01:06:30.152
MONTEREY OR THE DESERT ITSELF I

01:06:30.219 --> 01:06:31.854
THINK IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW

01:06:31.921 --> 01:06:32.755
THEY'VE USED.

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:38.060
FUND AND STRATEGIES.

01:06:38.127 --> 01:06:39.895
TO BILL MEDI CAL THROUGH THE

01:06:39.962 --> 01:06:42.765
SOUTH.

01:06:42.832 --> 01:06:43.432
IT SOUNDS LIKE THE THE THE

01:06:43.499 --> 01:06:43.999
EFFORT NEEDS TO START AT THE

01:06:44.066 --> 01:06:45.134
COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION

01:06:45.201 --> 01:06:46.235
AROUND THE STATE AND I IMAGINE

01:06:46.302 --> 01:06:47.837
IT'S PRETTY DIFFICULT FOR ONE

01:06:47.903 --> 01:06:50.206
SCHOOL DISTRICT OUT OF A BUNCH.

01:06:50.272 --> 01:06:51.407
TO GET FIGHT THE WAY TO THE

01:06:51.474 --> 01:06:53.676
TABLE AND STICK A HAND IN THE

01:06:53.743 --> 01:06:54.977
BUCKET GRAVEL BUNCH OF MONEY.

01:06:55.044 --> 01:06:57.480
SO WE REALLY NEED TO FIGURE OUT

01:06:57.546 --> 01:06:58.547
A WAY TO DRIVE.

01:06:58.614 --> 01:07:01.317
BEST PRACTICES FROM -- ONE COE

01:07:01.384 --> 01:07:02.852
TO OTHERS AROUND THE STATE SO

01:07:02.918 --> 01:07:05.788
THAT WE HAVE A SOMEWHAT.

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:07.523
RECOGNIZING THEIR DIFFERENCES

01:07:07.590 --> 01:07:08.724
WHAT'S YOUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

01:07:08.791 --> 01:07:10.926
PARTNERS THERE WITH YOUR TO

01:07:10.993 --> 01:07:12.294
DRIVE DOWN JACK LEE.

01:07:12.361 --> 01:07:14.063
EXACTLY.

01:07:14.130 --> 01:07:15.531
THANK YOU SORRY THANKS FOR YOUR

01:07:15.598 --> 01:07:17.933
PATIENCE NO PROBLEM YOU HAD LOTS

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:18.501
OF INTERESTING THINGS TO SAY

01:07:18.567 --> 01:07:19.702
RICHARD.

01:07:19.769 --> 01:07:22.338
SO I JUST WANT TO SAY HOW

01:07:22.405 --> 01:07:24.774
IMPORTANT I THINK THIS IS FOR A

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:26.876
NUMBER OF REASONS I DID READ

01:07:26.942 --> 01:07:28.043
THROUGH ALL OF THE COMMENTS.

01:07:28.110 --> 01:07:29.812
TIMES ARE SO DIFFERENT NOW THAN

01:07:29.879 --> 01:07:31.447
WHEN HE MADE ANY OF US WENT TO

01:07:31.514 --> 01:07:33.482
SCHOOL AND I THINK THAT OUR

01:07:33.549 --> 01:07:35.117
YOUNG PEOPLE AND OUR CHILDREN

01:07:35.184 --> 01:07:36.819
ARE LIVING IN SITUATIONS.

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:38.087
THAT NONE OF US CAN ALWAYS

01:07:38.154 --> 01:07:40.756
IMAGINE SO I THINK THIS THIS IS

01:07:40.823 --> 01:07:44.794
HELPFUL FOR A COUPLE REASONS.

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:46.095
ONE EVEN OUR TEACHERS PROBABLY

01:07:46.162 --> 01:07:48.063
DON'T UNDERSTAND EXACTLY BECOME

01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:49.632
RATED TEACH EVERY DAY AND RAY TO

01:07:49.698 --> 01:07:50.566
MAKE SURE THEY'RE DOING WHAT

01:07:50.633 --> 01:07:51.567
THEY NEED TO DO.

01:07:51.634 --> 01:07:53.469
BUT THEY MAY NOT REALIZE FULLY

01:07:53.536 --> 01:07:55.237
WITH THEIR STUDENTS ARE LIVING

01:07:55.304 --> 01:07:55.971
AT HOME.

01:07:56.038 --> 01:07:57.273
BUT I ALSO THINK THIS IS A GOOD

01:07:57.339 --> 01:07:59.642
AVENUE FOR STUDENTS TO BE ABLE

01:07:59.708 --> 01:08:01.777
TO START EXPRESSING THEMSELVES

01:08:01.844 --> 01:08:02.912
AND MAY BE STARTING TO REALIZE

01:08:02.978 --> 01:08:04.313
THAT BY EXPRESSING WHAT'S GOING

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:05.881
ON THEY CAN ACTUALLY ASK FOR

01:08:05.948 --> 01:08:06.515
HELP.

01:08:06.582 --> 01:08:08.184
SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS

01:08:08.250 --> 01:08:10.553
AND I HOPE WE CAN CONTINUE TO DO

01:08:10.619 --> 01:08:11.921
THINGS LIKE THIS.

01:08:11.987 --> 01:08:15.791
SECONDLY -- YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY

01:08:15.858 --> 01:08:19.562
A BIT -- SUBMIT THAT.

01:08:19.628 --> 01:08:20.429
MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS ON

01:08:20.496 --> 01:08:21.964
CAMPUS IS REALLY AN EUITY ISSUE.

01:08:22.031 --> 01:08:23.399
IF WE HAVE.

01:08:23.466 --> 01:08:24.500
SCHOOL DISTRICT ALL DOING

01:08:24.567 --> 01:08:26.735
DIFFERENT THINGS BASED ON HOW

01:08:26.802 --> 01:08:28.304
THEY SPEND THEIR EL CAP BASED ON

01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:29.738
IF THEY CAN PULL DOWN MONEY FROM

01:08:29.805 --> 01:08:31.874
PROP.

01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:33.576
SIXTY THREE I WOULD SAY -- THE

01:08:33.642 --> 01:08:34.710
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE REALLY DOESN'T

01:08:34.777 --> 01:08:37.012
WANT TO HEAR THIS BUT I THINK WE

01:08:37.079 --> 01:08:39.281
NEED TO DO SOMETHING AS A STATE

01:08:39.348 --> 01:08:41.417
TO MAKE SURE EVERY CAMPUS IN

01:08:41.484 --> 01:08:42.585
EVERY SCHOOL.

01:08:42.651 --> 01:08:44.587
ARE IN EVERY DISTRICT HAS A

01:08:44.653 --> 01:08:47.623
MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER BECAUSE

01:08:47.690 --> 01:08:49.058
IF WE DON'T DO THAT.

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:50.693
I DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL LIKE

01:08:50.759 --> 01:08:52.228
THAT WE JUST HAVE THIS PATCHWORK

01:08:52.294 --> 01:08:53.729
THAT WE KEEP DOING AND YOU KNOW

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:55.464
WE'VE GOT ONE SCHOOL OVER HERE

01:08:55.531 --> 01:08:56.532
OR SCHOOL DISTRICT YOU'RE WHO

01:08:56.599 --> 01:08:56.899
SAYS.

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:58.634
THIS IS OUR PRIORITY SO THESE

01:08:58.701 --> 01:09:00.436
KIDS HAVE ACCESS TO IT THE

01:09:00.503 --> 01:09:01.604
SCHOOL DISTRICT SAYS WELL THIS

01:09:01.670 --> 01:09:03.539
IS OUR PRIORITY BUT WHAT'S

01:09:03.606 --> 01:09:05.975
HAPPENING TO THOSE KIDS SO.

01:09:06.041 --> 01:09:06.842
I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO

01:09:06.909 --> 01:09:07.510
DO.

01:09:07.576 --> 01:09:08.744
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR WHAT ALL

01:09:08.811 --> 01:09:10.279
OF YOU WERE DOING BUT I THINK WE

01:09:10.346 --> 01:09:11.447
NEED TO DO MORE AT THE STATE

01:09:11.514 --> 01:09:13.215
LEVEL TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS

01:09:13.282 --> 01:09:15.351
THIS EQUITY ISSUES ADDRESS FOR

01:09:15.417 --> 01:09:17.086
ALL OF OUR STUDENTS I THINK IT'S

01:09:17.152 --> 01:09:19.522
ESPECIALLY SO WITH A VERY SMALL

01:09:19.588 --> 01:09:21.457
ROOM GET DISTRICTS BECAUSE IT.

01:09:21.524 --> 01:09:23.893
ISN'T IT IT YOU KNOW HAVING

01:09:23.959 --> 01:09:25.661
RELATIONSHIPS IS VERY IMPORTANT

01:09:25.728 --> 01:09:26.962
SO THAT YOU CAN GET SOME OF

01:09:27.029 --> 01:09:29.231
THOSE SERVICES BUT ALSO THE

01:09:29.298 --> 01:09:31.400
GEOGRAPHICAL DISTANCE WHERE.

01:09:31.467 --> 01:09:33.836
YOU MAY HAVE THE FUNDING SOURCES

01:09:33.903 --> 01:09:35.604
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE THE HUMAN

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:37.573
RESOURCES THE PERSON THAT WILL

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:39.675
COME OUT AND WE LIVE IT EVEN

01:09:39.742 --> 01:09:41.544
TALKED WHEN I TALK TO THE WELL.

01:09:41.610 --> 01:09:43.012
WEBSITE HEALTH CARE DISTRICT WE

01:09:43.078 --> 01:09:44.213
EVEN TALKED ABOUT THE

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:47.182
POSSIBILITY OF TELEMEDICINE YOU

01:09:47.249 --> 01:09:48.317
KNOW WHERE IS A STUDENT WOULD

01:09:48.384 --> 01:09:50.452
CALL IN AND THEY'RE TALKING TO A

01:09:50.519 --> 01:09:52.187
PROFESSIONAL BECAUSE THE PROBLEM

01:09:52.254 --> 01:09:54.123
FOR US TONIGHT I THINK WE WOULD

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:54.757
ALL SAY THIS IS.

01:09:54.823 --> 01:09:56.992
WE ARE NOT MENTAL HEALTH CARE

01:09:57.059 --> 01:09:58.694
PROFESSIONALS WE'RE NOT AND SO

01:09:58.761 --> 01:10:00.763
WHEN A STUDENT WHO IS IN CRISIS

01:10:00.829 --> 01:10:03.165
COMES TO US WE ARE DOING THE

01:10:03.232 --> 01:10:04.633
ABSOLUTE BEST THAT WE CAN AND

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:06.302
WE'RE MAKING DECISIONS AND

01:10:06.368 --> 01:10:07.836
TRYING TO CONNECT THEM.

01:10:07.903 --> 01:10:09.838
TO SOMETIMES STRUCTURES THAT

01:10:09.905 --> 01:10:12.341
DON'T YET EXIST RIGHT AND SO I

01:10:12.408 --> 01:10:13.876
THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AS

01:10:13.943 --> 01:10:16.946
WE THINK OF THE MANY SMALL RURAL

01:10:17.012 --> 01:10:18.714
DISTRICTS THAT ARE OUT THERE IS

01:10:18.781 --> 01:10:20.049
HOW DO WE SUPPORT.

01:10:20.115 --> 01:10:22.318
THEM AND MAKE THAT POSSIBLE FOR

01:10:22.384 --> 01:10:24.186
THEIR STUDENTS WHERE IT'S NOT

01:10:24.253 --> 01:10:25.588
BASED ON GEOGRAPHY.

01:10:25.654 --> 01:10:26.922
TOTALLY AGREE I THINK WE NEED TO

01:10:26.989 --> 01:10:29.358
USE ALL THE TOOLS IN OUR TOOLBOX

01:10:29.425 --> 01:10:31.594
AND IF TELEHEALTH TELEMEDICINE

01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:36.031
IF THAT WORKS BETTER.

01:10:36.098 --> 01:10:38.300
IT'S A EIGHT A GREAT THING TO

01:10:38.367 --> 01:10:39.468
USE I'M ALWAYS A FAN OF SOMEONE

01:10:39.535 --> 01:10:40.869
LOOKING SOMEONE IN THE EYE AND

01:10:40.936 --> 01:10:41.537
BEING RIGHT THERE.

01:10:41.604 --> 01:10:42.571
IT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK THAT WAY

01:10:42.638 --> 01:10:43.205
SO THAT TO BE CREATIVE -- BUT I

01:10:43.272 --> 01:10:45.040
JUST THINK THAT WE CAN DO BETTER

01:10:45.107 --> 01:10:45.674
BY OUR YOUNG PEOPLE THEY REALLY

01:10:45.741 --> 01:10:46.642

01:10:49.812 --> 01:10:51.547
DISTRICT PSYCHOLOGISTS BUT ONE

01:10:51.614 --> 01:10:52.648

01:11:02.358 --> 01:11:04.526
STATUTORY REQUIREMENT RIGHT THEY

SPECIAL EDUCATION PTA.

01:22:01.182 --> 01:22:02.917
MOVING ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.

01:22:02.984 --> 01:22:04.052
WE BELIEVE THE SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:22:04.119 --> 01:22:05.086
TO PA COMES WITH SOME STRENGTHS

01:22:05.153 --> 01:22:06.788
AND LIMITATIONS WE'LL START WITH

01:22:06.855 --> 01:22:07.956
A PROPOSAL STRENGTH.

01:22:08.023 --> 01:22:09.157
FIRST A SPECIAL EDUCATION TP A

01:22:09.224 --> 01:22:09.658
COULD BETTER PREPARE NEW

01:22:09.724 --> 01:22:10.725
TEACHERS TO ENTER THE CLASSROOM

01:22:10.792 --> 01:22:11.960
BY ASSESSING WHETHER OR NOT THEY

01:22:12.027 --> 01:22:12.827
HAVE EXPECTED.

01:22:12.894 --> 01:22:14.562
KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS TO PROVIDE

01:22:14.629 --> 01:22:15.830
INSTRUCTION TO STUDENTS WITH

01:22:15.897 --> 01:22:19.000
SPECIAL NEEDS THIS MAY INCLUDES.

01:22:19.067 --> 01:22:20.168
MANAGING CASES AND HER PARENTS

01:22:20.235 --> 01:22:21.870
ABOUT VISUALIZE -- EDUCATION

01:22:21.936 --> 01:22:22.971
PROGRAMS.

01:22:23.038 --> 01:22:24.105
ALTHOUGH THE EXISTING RESEARCH

01:22:24.172 --> 01:22:26.541
IS LIMITED WE DID FIND THREE

01:22:26.608 --> 01:22:27.542
STUDIES THAT JENNER ART THAT

01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:29.377
WERE GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE.

01:22:29.444 --> 01:22:31.813
OF THE CONNECTION BETWEEN HOW IT

01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:33.248
TEACHER PERFORMS ANA TKA AND

01:22:33.315 --> 01:22:35.116
ASSOCIATED IMPROVEMENTS IN

01:22:35.183 --> 01:22:36.618
STUDENT ACADEMIC OUTCOMES.

01:22:36.685 --> 01:22:38.119
SECOND EIGHTY PA COULD IMPROVE

01:22:38.186 --> 01:22:39.621
THE QUALITY OF TEACHER

01:22:39.688 --> 01:22:41.656
PREPARATION PROGRAMS FOR SPECIAL

01:22:41.723 --> 01:22:42.324
EDUCATION.

01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:43.892
CITY SEE INTENDS TO ANALYZE THE

01:22:43.958 --> 01:22:45.360
RESULTS FROM THE SPECIAL

01:22:45.427 --> 01:22:47.562
EDUCATION T. PA AND AND USE THAT

01:22:47.629 --> 01:22:48.763
INFORMATION TO INFORM WHETHER OR

01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:50.432
NOT TO IMPROVE PREPARATION

01:22:50.498 --> 01:22:51.633
PROGRAMS.

01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:53.134
WHETHER TO APPROVE THEM DURING

01:22:53.201 --> 01:22:55.203
THAT CREATION PROCESS.

01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:56.171
THIS DATA ANALYSIS WOULD ALSO

01:22:56.237 --> 01:22:57.739
HELP CDC IDENTIFY THE RELATIVE

01:22:57.806 --> 01:23:02.610
STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF EACH

01:23:02.677 --> 01:23:03.712
PROBE.

01:23:03.778 --> 01:23:04.579
LASTLY WE CONSIDER THE PROJECT

01:23:04.646 --> 01:23:06.481
COST AND FUN SOURCE TO BE

01:23:06.548 --> 01:23:07.048
REASONABLE.

01:23:07.115 --> 01:23:08.817
CITY SEIZE COST ESTIMATE FOR THE

01:23:08.883 --> 01:23:09.351
SPECIAL EDUCATION T. PAY

01:23:09.417 --> 01:23:09.984
REFLECTS SOME SAVINGS FROM THE

01:23:10.051 --> 01:23:12.153
RE PURPOSING OF COMPONENTS OF

01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:13.254
THE GENERAL EDUCATION GPA.

01:23:13.321 --> 01:23:14.289
IN OTHER WORDS CITY SEE WOULD

01:23:14.356 --> 01:23:15.890
NOT BE STARTING FROM SCRATCH

01:23:15.957 --> 01:23:17.759
WHEN DEVELOPING THE SPECIAL

01:23:17.826 --> 01:23:18.960
EDUCATION TVA.

01:23:19.027 --> 01:23:20.095
ADDITIONALLY THE PROPOSED FUND

01:23:20.161 --> 01:23:21.563
SOURCE IS IF THE CIVIC WE

01:23:21.629 --> 01:23:23.465
INTENDED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND

01:23:23.531 --> 01:23:24.566
ADMINISTRATION OF TAX.

01:23:24.632 --> 01:23:25.533
THE SPECIAL FUND HAS BEEN

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:26.768
GROWING IN THE RECENT YEARS AND

01:23:26.835 --> 01:23:28.703
IS LIKELY ABLE TO SUPPORT THE

01:23:28.770 --> 01:23:30.238
PROPOSAL'S.

01:23:30.305 --> 01:23:35.910
MOVING ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.

01:23:35.977 --> 01:23:36.945
HERE WE DISCUSS TO POTENTIAL

01:23:37.011 --> 01:23:38.079
DOWNSIDES WITH THE PROPOSAL'S.

01:23:38.146 --> 01:23:38.713
FIRST WHEN WE SPOKE TO GENERAL

01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:40.682
EDUCATION TEACHERS WHO COMPLETED

01:23:40.749 --> 01:23:42.317
THE EXISTING T. PA.

01:23:42.384 --> 01:23:42.951
WE CONSIDER THE T. PAY TO BE A

01:23:43.017 --> 01:23:45.487
RATHER TIME INTENSIVE EXERCISE.

01:23:45.553 --> 01:23:46.521
THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:23:46.588 --> 01:23:48.823
AMOUNT OF TIME IT TOOK RELATIVE

01:23:48.890 --> 01:23:50.091
TO HOW HELPFUL THEY FOUND IT AS

01:23:50.158 --> 01:23:51.693
A PREPARATION TOOL AND THIS IS

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:52.761
ESPECIALLY COMPARED TO OTHER

01:23:52.827 --> 01:23:53.895
COMPONENTS OF TEACHING

01:23:53.962 --> 01:23:55.930
PREPARATION SUCH AS COURSE WORK.

01:23:55.997 --> 01:23:57.332
AND STUDENT TEACHING.

01:23:57.399 --> 01:23:59.033
LASTLY WE ARE UNCERTAIN ABOUT

01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:00.168
THE POTENTIAL IMPACT THAT A

01:24:00.235 --> 01:24:02.437
SPECIAL EDUCATION T. PAY MIGHT

01:24:02.504 --> 01:24:03.938
HAVE ON TEACHER SUPPLY.

01:24:04.005 --> 01:24:05.440
AS YOU KNOW THE STATE FACES A

01:24:05.507 --> 01:24:06.808
CHRONIC SHORTAGE OF SPECIAL

01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:09.244
EDUCATION TEACHERS WHICH WILL

01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:10.178
SPEAK MORE ABOUT IN THE NEXT

01:24:10.245 --> 01:24:10.612
PANEL.

01:24:10.678 --> 01:24:12.514
BUT TO MEET THE DEMANDS FOR

01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:14.649
SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS MANY

01:24:14.716 --> 01:24:15.583
SCHOOL DISTRICTS RSORT TO YOU

01:24:15.650 --> 01:24:17.485
OUR STATE RECRUITMENT OR HIRE

01:24:17.552 --> 01:24:19.621
STAFF WHO DO NOT MEET ALL

01:24:19.687 --> 01:24:21.589
CREDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS.

01:24:21.656 --> 01:24:22.757
IN NEW TO PAY REQUIREMENT WHAT

01:24:22.824 --> 01:24:24.692
OUT OF WORK AND COST TO THE

01:24:24.759 --> 01:24:26.327
PROCESS OF BECOMING A SPECIAL

01:24:26.394 --> 01:24:27.662
EDUCATION TEACHER.

01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:29.931
ALTHOUGH THE ADDITION OF A T. PA

01:24:29.998 --> 01:24:31.599
MIGHT SEEM MODEST IN THE CONTEXT

01:24:31.666 --> 01:24:33.401
OF ALL THE OTHER REQUIREMENTS WE

01:24:33.468 --> 01:24:34.302
HAVE FOR NEW TEACHERS.

01:24:34.369 --> 01:24:36.704
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOME OF THE

01:24:36.771 --> 01:24:38.440
SOME OF THIS SOME OF THE

01:24:38.506 --> 01:24:39.808
REQUIREMENTS COULD AFFECT THE

01:24:39.874 --> 01:24:41.476
NUMBER OF PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS

01:24:41.543 --> 01:24:42.944
THAT ARE INTERESTED IN AND

01:24:43.011 --> 01:24:45.680
ULTIMATELY UP TINA SPECIAL

01:24:45.747 --> 01:24:49.350
EDUCATION CREDENTIAL.

01:24:49.417 --> 01:24:51.586
MOVING ON TO THE LAST PAGE.

01:24:51.653 --> 01:24:52.587
WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE

01:24:52.654 --> 01:24:53.221
ADOPTS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

01:24:53.288 --> 01:24:54.255
TO FUND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE

01:24:54.322 --> 01:24:57.091
SPECIAL EDUCATION TO PA AND AT

01:24:57.158 --> 01:24:57.725
ONE NEW POSITION TO CDC.

01:24:57.792 --> 01:24:58.393
WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE SOME

01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:00.195
TRADE OFFS BUT ON BALANCE WE

01:25:00.261 --> 01:25:01.963
THINK THE PROPOSAL'S COULD HELP

01:25:02.030 --> 01:25:03.531
IMPROVE TEACHER PREPARATION AND

01:25:03.598 --> 01:25:04.666
BRING SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:25:04.732 --> 01:25:06.167
REQUIREMENTS IN LINE WITH THE

01:25:06.234 --> 01:25:07.769
ONES THAT THE STATE HAS FOR

01:25:07.836 --> 01:25:08.870
GENERAL EDUCATION.

01:25:08.937 --> 01:25:10.071
HOWEVER WE RECOMMENDS THE

01:25:10.138 --> 01:25:12.240
LEGISLATURE REQUIRE CDC TO

01:25:12.307 --> 01:25:14.309
ASSESS AND REPORT HOW THE

01:25:14.375 --> 01:25:16.211
SPECIAL EDUCATION T. PA WHAT MAY

01:25:16.277 --> 01:25:19.180
AFFECT TEACHER SUPPLY BY JANUARY.

01:25:19.247 --> 01:25:21.516
TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHICH IS WHEN

01:25:21.583 --> 01:25:22.050
THIS REQUIREMENT WOULD BE

01:25:22.116 --> 01:25:23.151
IMPLEMENTED.

01:25:23.218 --> 01:25:23.918
CDC COULD COLLECT INFORMATION

01:25:23.985 --> 01:25:25.119
DURING THE PILOT PHASE OF

01:25:25.186 --> 01:25:26.421
IMPLEMENTATION REGARDING QUAN%

01:25:26.488 --> 01:25:27.722
HOW THE T. PAY IS AFFECTING

01:25:27.789 --> 01:25:29.824
INTEREST IN SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:25:29.891 --> 01:25:32.126
TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS. TO

01:25:32.193 --> 01:25:33.094
HOW MUCH TIME IT TAKES TO

01:25:33.161 --> 01:25:34.662
COMPLETE THE DPA AND HOW THIS

01:25:34.729 --> 01:25:36.231
AFFECTS THE OVERALL WORKLOAD.

01:25:36.297 --> 01:25:37.365
AND THREE WHAT PERSPECTIVE

01:25:37.432 --> 01:25:38.666
TEACHERS CONSIDER THE ADDED

01:25:38.733 --> 01:25:41.035
VALUE OF THE T. PAY AND BETTER

01:25:41.102 --> 01:25:42.303
PREPARING THEM FOR THE CLASSROOM.

01:25:42.370 --> 01:25:43.171
THE LEGISLATURE CAN THEN USE

01:25:43.238 --> 01:25:45.106
THIS INFORMATION TO EVALUATE

01:25:45.173 --> 01:25:46.508
WHETHER A SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:25:46.574 --> 01:25:48.009
TEACH PA COULD AFFECT INTEREST

01:25:48.076 --> 01:25:49.444
WORKLOAD AND COMPLETION RATES IN

01:25:49.511 --> 01:25:50.612
THESE PROGRAMS.

01:25:50.678 --> 01:25:52.113
LASTLY IF THE LEGISLATURE IS

01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:53.248
INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE

01:25:53.314 --> 01:25:54.649
ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE T. P.

01:25:54.716 --> 01:25:55.750
AND STUDENT OUTCOMES WERE

01:25:55.817 --> 01:25:57.585
GENERALLY IT COULD FIND AN

01:25:57.652 --> 01:25:59.020
INDEPENDENT EVALUATION.

01:25:59.087 --> 01:26:00.388
THIS WOULD HELP INFORM WHETHER

01:26:00.455 --> 01:26:02.423
REQUIRING GENERAL AND IN SPECIAL

01:26:02.490 --> 01:26:04.025
ED TEACHERS TAKE A GPA ACHIEVES

01:26:04.092 --> 01:26:05.860
THE ACTUAL GOALS OF IMPROVING

01:26:05.927 --> 01:26:07.395
TEACHER PREPARATION AND STUDENT

01:26:07.462 --> 01:26:08.429
OUTCOMES.

01:26:08.496 --> 01:26:10.031
THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS AND I

01:26:10.098 --> 01:26:11.566
WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY

01:26:11.633 --> 01:26:15.503
QUESTIONS THANK YOU.

01:26:15.570 --> 01:26:17.438
WELL JUST A COUPLE COMMENTS --

01:26:17.505 --> 01:26:19.974
YOU KNOW IT OCCURS TO ME THAT IF

01:26:20.041 --> 01:26:20.975
THE TP A IS.

01:26:21.042 --> 01:26:22.610
AS VALUE FOR GENERAL EDUCATION

01:26:22.677 --> 01:26:24.145
TEACHERS I DON'T KNOW WHY WE

01:26:24.212 --> 01:26:27.148
WOULDN'T DO WITH DOING THAT FOR

01:26:27.215 --> 01:26:28.550
SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS --

01:26:28.616 --> 01:26:30.184
BUT I THINK THE OVERRIDING

01:26:30.251 --> 01:26:32.020
QUESTION WHICH MAYBE IS YET TO

01:26:32.086 --> 01:26:33.087
BE ANSWERED.

01:26:33.154 --> 01:26:35.290
IS GIVEN THE TEACHER RECRUITING

01:26:35.356 --> 01:26:36.391
ISSUES.

01:26:36.457 --> 01:26:38.993
GIVEN THE SHORTAGE OF SPECIAL

01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:40.261
EDUCATION TEACHERS.

01:26:40.328 --> 01:26:41.629
HAS THERE BEEN ANY VALUE

01:26:41.696 --> 01:26:43.064
ASSESSMENT OF THE T. P. A. IN

01:26:43.131 --> 01:26:44.866
GENERAL WITH RESPECT SPEC TO THE

01:26:44.933 --> 01:26:46.568
GENERAL.

01:26:46.634 --> 01:26:48.036
EDUCATION.

01:26:48.102 --> 01:26:49.637
TEACHER POPULATION.

01:26:49.704 --> 01:26:51.806
OF AND HAS THAT WHEN WAS THAT

01:26:51.873 --> 01:26:53.341
ASSESSMENT AND WHAT WERE THE

01:26:53.408 --> 01:26:54.943
RESULTS AND IF NOT.

01:26:55.009 --> 01:26:57.011
PERHAPS IN ADDITION TO DOING THE

01:26:57.078 --> 01:26:58.846
ASSESSMENT.

01:26:58.913 --> 01:27:00.582
FOR OF THE SPECIAL ED -- SEGMENT

01:27:00.648 --> 01:27:02.750
IS THAT THIS RULES OUT MAYBE THE

01:27:02.817 --> 01:27:04.385
ASSESSMENT SHOULD BE APPLIED TO

01:27:04.452 --> 01:27:06.654
THE GENERAL CHECK.

01:27:06.721 --> 01:27:09.023
POPULATIONS WELL DR I'M HAPPY TO

01:27:09.090 --> 01:27:10.258
ANSWER OF THOSE QUESTIONS SO

01:27:10.325 --> 01:27:11.559
THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH

01:27:11.626 --> 01:27:13.261
TEACHING PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS

01:27:13.328 --> 01:27:15.897
FOR THE GENERAL POPULATION. FOR

01:27:15.964 --> 01:27:16.431
FIFTEEN YEARS.

01:27:16.497 --> 01:27:17.832
ARMS AND SO WE'VE LEARNED A

01:27:17.899 --> 01:27:19.901
GREAT DEAL ABOUT HOW TO DO THIS

01:27:19.968 --> 01:27:21.736
AND AND HOW THEY BEST SUPPORT

01:27:21.803 --> 01:27:23.271
AND STRENGTH IN THE PREPARATION.

01:27:23.338 --> 01:27:24.272
OF TEACHERS WITHOUT OVER

01:27:24.339 --> 01:27:25.440
BURDENING THEM WITH MEANINGLESS

01:27:25.506 --> 01:27:27.942
TASKS THIS IS NOT YOUR AVERAGE

01:27:28.009 --> 01:27:29.644
TEST WHAT WITH THIS ASSESSMENT

01:27:29.711 --> 01:27:32.013
DOES IS IT IT ORGANIZES THEIR

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:33.414
STUDENT TEACHING EXPERIENCE WITH

01:27:33.481 --> 01:27:35.083
SOME VERY SPECIFIC CONCRETE

01:27:35.149 --> 01:27:36.351
TASKS AROUND PLANNING

01:27:36.417 --> 01:27:37.418
INSTRUCTION.

01:27:37.485 --> 01:27:38.920
ADAPTING INSTRUCTION TO THE

01:27:38.987 --> 01:27:40.188
LEARNERS THEIR TEACHING

01:27:40.254 --> 01:27:41.322
ASSESSING INSTRUCTION

01:27:41.389 --> 01:27:43.157
DETERMINING WHO'S LEARNING WHAT

01:27:43.224 --> 01:27:44.158
THEY NEED TO DO NEXT INSTRUCTION

01:27:44.225 --> 01:27:49.430
ONLY IT'S VERY DEEPLY.

01:27:49.497 --> 01:27:51.532
AND IT OCCURS COMPLETELY WITHIN

01:27:51.599 --> 01:27:52.667
THE CONTEXT OF STUDENT TEACHING

01:27:52.734 --> 01:27:55.036
SO IT'S NOT AN ADDED REQUIREMENT

01:27:55.103 --> 01:27:57.538
IT IS AN ORGANIZER IF YOU WILL

01:27:57.605 --> 01:27:59.107
OR THAT PART OF THE EXPERIENCE.

01:27:59.173 --> 01:28:01.075
WE HAVE NOT FOUND THAT IT IS A

01:28:01.142 --> 01:28:03.378
HINDRANCE TO RECRUITMENT IN THE

01:28:03.444 --> 01:28:05.279
JANET SPACE -- AND WE'RE NOT

01:28:05.346 --> 01:28:06.447
EXPECTING IT TO BE IN THE

SPECIAL EDUCATION -- WORLD

01:28:08.349 --> 01:28:09.217
EITHER.

01:28:09.283 --> 01:28:11.519
ESSENTIALLY IT'S OUR IT'S OUR

01:28:11.586 --> 01:28:14.322
EXPERIENCE THAT WHEN CANDIDATES

01:28:14.389 --> 01:28:15.657
APPLY TO ENTER INTO TEACHER

01:28:15.723 --> 01:28:17.492
PREPARATION REGARDLESS OF THE

01:28:17.558 --> 01:28:18.526
CREDENTIAL THEY'RE SEEKING.

01:28:18.593 --> 01:28:20.328
ACCEPT THE CONDITIONS OF THAT

01:28:20.395 --> 01:28:21.396
PREPARATION.

01:28:21.462 --> 01:28:22.463
AND THEY THEY AREN'T

01:28:22.530 --> 01:28:23.831
PARTICULARLY DISCRIMINATING AT

01:28:23.898 --> 01:28:25.299
THE POINT OF APPLICATION SHOULD

01:28:25.366 --> 01:28:27.235
I GO IN SHOULD I NOT GO IN --

01:28:27.301 --> 01:28:28.770
THERE'S A BIG TEST I MIGHT NOT

01:28:28.836 --> 01:28:29.604
THAT'S NOT WITH THINKING THEY'RE

01:28:29.671 --> 01:28:30.938
THINKING I'D LIKE TO BE A

01:28:31.005 --> 01:28:33.307
SPECIAL ED TEACHER WHERE'S THE

01:28:33.374 --> 01:28:34.642
BEST PLACE FOR ME TO GO AND HOW

01:28:34.709 --> 01:28:35.910
DO I GET THIS DONE AND IT OCCURS

01:28:35.977 --> 01:28:37.679
WITHIN THE IN THE IN THE

01:28:37.745 --> 01:28:38.613
FRAMEWORK OF THEIR STUDENT

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:39.047
TEACHER.

01:28:39.113 --> 01:28:40.915
THAT'S CORRECT AND AND WHAT WHAT

01:28:40.982 --> 01:28:43.384
HAPPENS TO THE AFTER YOU TAKE

01:28:43.451 --> 01:28:45.920
YOUR TP A IS -- IS -- FEEDBACK

01:28:45.987 --> 01:28:46.621
IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED YES SO

01:28:46.688 --> 01:28:48.823
IT'S USED AS A TOOL TO THEN

01:28:48.890 --> 01:28:50.625
PROVIDE FEEDBACK TO THE TO THE

01:28:50.692 --> 01:28:53.127
PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS WHAT THEY

01:28:53.194 --> 01:28:53.795
NEED TO DO AND WHAT THEY NEED TO

01:28:53.861 --> 01:28:56.264
BETTER MULTI FACETED FEEDBACK.

01:28:56.330 --> 01:28:57.832
THE THE ASSESSMENTS AS WE'VE

01:28:57.899 --> 01:28:59.033
DESIGNED OF THEM NOW HAVE.

01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:02.437
OF DIAGNOSTIC RUBRICS WHERE THEY

01:29:02.503 --> 01:29:03.938
GET FEEDBACK ON IT FOR JANET

01:29:04.005 --> 01:29:05.273
TEACHERS I THINK IT'S EIGHTEEN

01:29:05.339 --> 01:29:07.341
OR SO DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS OF

01:29:07.408 --> 01:29:08.609
THEIR TEACHING.

01:29:08.676 --> 01:29:10.712
THEY GET A SPECIFIC SCORE -- AND

01:29:10.778 --> 01:29:12.380
ITS USE THEY USE THOSE THAT

01:29:12.447 --> 01:29:13.815
FEEDBACK TO DESIGN THEIR

01:29:13.881 --> 01:29:15.249
INDIVIDUALIZED INDUCTION PLANS

01:29:15.316 --> 01:29:16.984
WHEN THEY BEGIN EMPLOYMENT THEY

01:29:17.051 --> 01:29:18.786
GO INTO AN INDUCTION PROGRAM.

01:29:18.853 --> 01:29:20.254
SO THIS BECOMES AWARE WERE MY

01:29:20.321 --> 01:29:21.923
STRINGS WERE MY WEAKNESSES HOW

01:29:21.989 --> 01:29:22.890
WHAT'S NEXT FOR ME AND

01:29:22.957 --> 01:29:23.991
DEVELOPMENT SO THAT'S REALLY

01:29:24.058 --> 01:29:25.593
IMPORTANT PART OF THIS ITS

01:29:25.660 --> 01:29:26.928
FORMATIVE IN THAT WAY.

01:29:26.994 --> 01:29:28.696
BUT IT ALSO IS THE ACCREDITING

01:29:28.763 --> 01:29:30.364
BODY TELLS US A LOT ABOUT HOW

01:29:30.431 --> 01:29:32.700
PREPARATION IS WORKING IF ALL OF

THE CANDIDATES ARE STRUGGLING

01:29:33.801 --> 01:29:35.036
WITH LET'S SAY ADOPTING

01:29:37.405 --> 01:29:38.639
THEN WE KNOW WHAT TO WHAT WE'RE

01:29:38.706 --> 01:29:39.974
LOOKING FOR WHEN WE GO IN AND A

01:29:40.041 --> 01:29:41.342
CREDIT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SEE

01:29:41.409 --> 01:29:42.944
WHAT PATTERNS OF PERFORMANCE

01:29:43.010 --> 01:29:45.046
LOOK LIKE AND IT'S EXTREMELY

01:29:45.113 --> 01:29:46.748
HELPFUL IN THAT REGARD -- SO WE

01:29:46.814 --> 01:29:53.921
USE IT FOR ACCREDITATION

01:29:53.988 --> 01:29:55.790
PURPOSES FAQ MULTI IN THESE

01:29:55.857 --> 01:29:56.357
PROGRAMS USE IT SO THEY CAN

01:29:56.424 --> 01:29:57.525
GAUGE WHERE ARE WE HITTING THE

01:29:57.592 --> 01:29:58.626
MARK WHERE WE MISSING IT WITH

01:29:58.693 --> 01:29:59.260
OUR CANDIDATES WHERE DO WE NEED

01:29:59.327 --> 01:29:59.627
TO STRENGTHEN.

01:29:59.694 --> 01:30:00.428
SO THIS IS A TOOL THAT GIVES US

01:30:00.495 --> 01:30:01.028
CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT ACROSS

01:30:01.095 --> 01:30:02.196
ALL SECTORS STATE PROGRAM AND

WE LAID OFF TEACHERS.

01:30:45.907 --> 01:30:48.609
AND HAD OF A SURPLUS AND THAT

01:30:48.676 --> 01:30:49.844
WAS DUE TO ECONOMIC DOWNTURN.

01:30:49.911 --> 01:30:51.846
OF WE VERY QUICKLY AS ECONOMIC

01:30:51.913 --> 01:30:54.248

WE'VE SEEN FORTY FIVE MILLION

01:31:56.944 --> 01:31:58.312
DOLLARS INVESTED IN IT OVER TWO

01:31:58.379 --> 01:31:59.580
CYCLES.

BIT OVER THE OVER THE NEXT

01:32:29.210 --> 01:32:30.311
SEVERAL YEARS WE EXPECT TO SEE

WAS SAID THIS IS AN

01:32:43.958 --> 01:32:44.525
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT OF TEN

01:32:44.592 --> 01:32:45.059

A HALF YEARS.

01:32:54.869 --> 01:32:56.437
SO THESE GRANTS WERE FOR TWO

01:32:56.504 --> 01:32:58.072
YEARS FOR PROGRAMS TO DESIGN

01:32:58.139 --> 01:33:00.775
THIS THIS POT THIS PATHWAY.

01:33:00.841 --> 01:33:02.543

YEAR AND WE WOULD EXPECT BECAUSE

01:33:19.527 --> 01:33:20.294
THIS IS INFRASTRUCTURE

01:33:20.361 --> 01:33:21.829
REBUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE THIS

01:33:21.896 --> 01:33:23.497
WILL BECOME A PATHWAY.

01:33:23.564 --> 01:33:25.299
THAT WE HOPE IS POPULAR AND

01:33:25.366 --> 01:33:27.368
DRAWS YOUNGER FRESHMAN INTO A

01:33:27.435 --> 01:33:28.569
PATHWAY THAT GETS THEM A

LEARN THAT.

01:33:34.842 --> 01:33:35.710

BUT IT'S AN EXCITING TIME TO BE

01:37:05.419 --> 01:37:06.253
DOING IT.

01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:07.955
WE HAVE OF DUNN'S WE'RE DOING

01:37:08.022 --> 01:37:10.925
SOME MAJOR THINGS WITH -- MTS

01:37:10.991 --> 01:37:12.226
SAYS ANOTHER OTHER WAYS OF

01:37:12.293 --> 01:37:13.928
THINKING ABOUT HOW WE DELIVER

01:37:13.994 --> 01:37:15.262
SERVICES TO KIDS.

01:37:15.329 --> 01:37:16.597
AND AND THIS RESIDENCY

01:37:16.664 --> 01:37:18.232
OPPORTUNITY NOW GIVES US THE

01:37:18.299 --> 01:37:19.333
CHANCE TO REALLY PREPARE NEXT

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:21.635
GENERATION.

01:37:21.702 --> 01:37:22.236
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED A SPECIAL

01:37:22.303 --> 01:37:23.671

THROUGH THIS PROGRAM OVER THE

01:37:24.905 --> 01:37:26.674
NEXT FOUR YEARS AND AT THE END

01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:28.576
OF THAT THE GOAL IS THAT THE

01:37:28.642 --> 01:37:29.944
RESIDENCY PROGRAM ITSELF.

01:37:30.010 --> 01:37:31.712
ISN'T JUST SOMETHING THAT EXIST

01:37:31.779 --> 01:37:32.613
AS LONG AS THE GRANT FUNDING IS

01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:34.114
THERE BUT IT'S AN ONGOING

01:37:34.181 --> 01:37:35.249
INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:37:35.316 --> 01:37:36.784
SO IN ONLY A THE GETS THIS GRANT

01:37:36.850 --> 01:37:38.919
HAS BUILT PARTNERSHIPS WITH

01:37:38.986 --> 01:37:40.354
OTHER HIGHER ED PARTNERS.

01:37:40.421 --> 01:37:41.922
AND DID THIS PROGRAM CONTINUES

01:37:41.989 --> 01:37:43.724
TO EXIST AS A WAY OF BRINGING IN

01:37:43.791 --> 01:37:48.062
IN TRAINING THEIR OWN TEACHING

01:37:48.128 --> 01:37:48.929
WORKFORCE.

01:37:48.996 --> 01:37:50.397
IT'S VERY EXCITING WE AWARDED

01:37:50.464 --> 01:37:51.999
THIRTY SIX GRANTS TO ELEAZAR TO

01:37:52.066 --> 01:37:53.100
GET THAT WORK STARTED THIS YEAR.

01:37:53.167 --> 01:37:53.734
AND THEN THERE WAS ALSO A FIVE

01:37:53.801 --> 01:37:55.536
MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME A GRANT

01:37:55.603 --> 01:37:57.972
PROVIDED TO RE ESTABLISH A

01:37:58.038 --> 01:37:59.573
CENTER FOR TEACHING CAREERS.

01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:00.774
THAT FUNDING WENT TO TULARE

01:38:00.841 --> 01:38:02.243
COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION IT

01:38:02.309 --> 01:38:03.611
WAS INITIALLY A THREE YEAR GRANT

01:38:03.677 --> 01:38:04.612
THIS IS.

01:38:04.678 --> 01:38:05.679
A WOULD HAVE BEEN THE END OF

01:38:05.746 --> 01:38:07.047
THEIR FUNDING BUT I THINK THEY

01:38:07.114 --> 01:38:08.048
HAD SOME OTHER OPPORTUNITIES

01:38:08.115 --> 01:38:09.149
COME IN AND THEY'VE GOT ANOTHER

01:38:09.216 --> 01:38:10.251
YEAR OF FUNDING.

01:38:10.317 --> 01:38:11.552
BUT THEY'VE PUT TOGETHER A

01:38:11.619 --> 01:38:15.155
VIRTUAL TEACHER RECRUITMENT --

01:38:15.222 --> 01:38:17.558
WEB BASED PLATFORM A AND THEY'VE

01:38:17.625 --> 01:38:18.125
BEEN DOING A LOT OF TEACHER

01:38:18.192 --> 01:38:19.727
RECRUITMENT WORK THROUGH THAT

01:38:19.793 --> 01:38:22.129
AND AND HAVING BOTH OF VIRTUAL

01:38:22.196 --> 01:38:27.968
AND PHYSICAL -- RECRUITMENT.

01:38:28.035 --> 01:38:29.837
THERE'S BEEN FAIRLY SUCCESSFUL

01:38:29.903 --> 01:38:30.971
IN TERMS OF PEOPLE TEACHER

01:38:31.038 --> 01:38:32.439
CANDIDATES LOOKING FOR THROUGH

01:38:32.506 --> 01:38:35.476
THIS OPPORTUNITY TO FIND OTHER

01:38:35.542 --> 01:38:38.078
POSITIONS IN TEACHING -- SO THAT

01:38:38.145 --> 01:38:39.480
THAT PIECE IS ALSO UNDER WAY BUT

01:38:39.546 --> 01:38:41.482
THAT FUNDING WILL EXPIRE AND AND

01:38:41.548 --> 01:38:43.017
I'M NOT SURE WHAT THEIR FUTURE

01:38:43.083 --> 01:38:44.718
WILL BE.

01:38:44.785 --> 01:38:45.552
SO THAT'S WHAT THE GRANTS HAVE

01:38:45.619 --> 01:38:48.055
DONE -- TEN THOUSAND TEACHERS OR

01:38:48.122 --> 01:38:48.989
TEN THOUSAND PLACEMENTS AS A

01:38:49.056 --> 01:38:50.257
RESULT OF THIS INVESTMENT ARE

01:38:50.324 --> 01:38:53.127
EXPECTED OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS

01:38:53.193 --> 01:38:54.261
OR FOR SEASON FIVE YEARS.

01:38:54.328 --> 01:38:55.896
WILL THIS TAKE CARE OF THE

01:38:55.963 --> 01:38:57.998
PROBLEM OF SHORTAGES -- IT

01:38:58.065 --> 01:38:59.800
REMAINS TO BE SEEN WE'VE SEEN

01:38:59.867 --> 01:39:01.268
STEADY INCREASES IN TEACHER

01:39:01.335 --> 01:39:02.903
ENROLLMENT -- TEACHER EDUCATION

01:39:02.970 --> 01:39:05.005
ENROLLMENT 11% JUST IN THE LAST

01:39:05.072 --> 01:39:08.342
FROM -- 201-617-21718 SO

01:39:08.409 --> 01:39:09.910
ENROLLMENT IS GOING UP THAT'S A

01:39:09.977 --> 01:39:11.278
VERY GOOD TREND.

01:39:11.345 --> 01:39:13.914
OF WE THINK THAT SOME OF THE

01:39:13.981 --> 01:39:15.382
STIMULUS IS HELPING WITH THAT --

01:39:15.449 --> 01:39:17.985
SO THAT'S THAT'S ONE INDICATOR

01:39:18.052 --> 01:39:18.652
THAT THAT WE MAY BE ON THE RIGHT

01:39:18.719 --> 01:39:20.454
TRACK -- BUT IN THE BIG PICTURE

01:39:20.521 --> 01:39:22.423
OVERALL THIS YEAR WE SAW ABOUT A

01:39:22.489 --> 01:39:23.557
THREE AND A HALF PERCENT

01:39:23.624 --> 01:39:24.725
INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF

01:39:24.792 --> 01:39:26.927
TEACHING CREDENTIALS WE ISSUED.

01:39:26.994 --> 01:39:28.462
TO THE FIELD THIRTY TWO HUNDRED

01:39:28.529 --> 01:39:30.497
OF THOSE CREDENTIALS WENT TO

01:39:30.564 --> 01:39:33.100
SPECIAL EDUCATORS -- IN TWENTY

01:39:33.167 --> 01:39:33.701
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN IN THIS IS

01:39:33.767 --> 01:39:35.169
ABOUT A 6% INCREASE FOR HIGHER

01:39:35.235 --> 01:39:37.304
EDUCATION SO AGAIN I THINK THAT

01:39:37.371 --> 01:39:39.139
THE AVAILABILITY OF STIMULUS AN

01:39:39.206 --> 01:39:40.174
OPPORTUNITY.

01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:41.809
IS ATTRACTING PEOPLE IT'S JUST

01:39:41.875 --> 01:39:43.610
ATTRACTIVE ON THE NATURAL WHEN

01:39:43.677 --> 01:39:48.148
THERE'S THESE OPPORTUNITIES ARE

01:39:48.215 --> 01:39:49.750
OUT THERE BEING ADVERTISED.

01:39:49.817 --> 01:39:50.684
WILL COME IF YOU BUILD IT THEY

01:39:50.751 --> 01:39:52.086
WILL COME MAYBE THAT'S A THEORY

01:39:52.152 --> 01:39:54.221
OF ACTION. FOR AS SO AT THE SAME

01:39:54.288 --> 01:39:55.122
TIME THAT WE'VE SEEN THAT INFLUX

01:39:55.189 --> 01:39:57.191
IN THAT INCOMING IN THAT GROWTH.

01:39:57.257 --> 01:39:59.426
WE SOULD SEVENTY EIGHT HUNDRED

01:39:59.493 --> 01:40:00.561
EMERGENCY PERMITS LAST YEAR.

01:40:00.627 --> 01:40:02.229
AND THAT'S BIG THAT'S  LOT OF

01:40:02.296 --> 01:40:03.630
CLASSROOMS EVERY SINGLE ONE OF

01:40:03.697 --> 01:40:04.698
THOSE IS A CLASSROOM OF STUDENTS

01:40:04.765 --> 01:40:05.966
BEING TAUGHT BY SOMEBODY WHO

01:40:06.033 --> 01:40:06.867
DOESN'T HAVE A CREDENTIAL.

01:40:06.934 --> 01:40:08.569
AND THAT IS OF CONCERN TO ALL OF

01:40:08.635 --> 01:40:09.269
US.

01:40:09.336 --> 01:40:11.638
ABOUT A THIRD OF THOSE WERE IN

01:40:11.705 --> 01:40:12.239
SPECIAL EDUCATION.

01:40:12.306 --> 01:40:13.173
AND THAT'S EVEN THAT'S OF EVEN

01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:14.808
GREATER CONCERN GIVEN THE

01:40:14.875 --> 01:40:17.144
SPECIAL NEEDS THAT THE STUDENTS

01:40:17.211 --> 01:40:17.611
PRESENT.

01:40:17.678 --> 01:40:19.813
IN THE SCHOOLS -- OVER THE LAST

01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:23.050
FIVE YEARS WE'VE SEEN ABOUT A

01:40:23.117 --> 01:40:24.785
EMERGENCY PERMITS GOING TO

01:40:24.852 --> 01:40:26.019
SPECIAL EDUCATORS.

01:40:26.086 --> 01:40:28.222
SO THESE KINDS OF INCENTIVES ARE

01:40:28.288 --> 01:40:30.624
REALLY QUITE CRITICAL TO STEM

01:40:30.691 --> 01:40:31.925
THAT TIDE TO REPLACE THOSE

01:40:31.992 --> 01:40:33.927
EMERGENCY PERMIT HOLDERS WITH

01:40:33.994 --> 01:40:35.362
PEOPLE WHO ARE TRAINED OR IN

01:40:35.429 --> 01:40:37.698
TRAINING TO GET TO GET THIS WORK.

01:40:37.765 --> 01:40:38.999
WHAT IS THE A MURDER THE FOLKS

01:40:39.066 --> 01:40:40.768
WHO ARE TEACHING WAS EMERGENCY

01:40:40.834 --> 01:40:42.870
PERMIT HAVE HAVE TO BE

01:40:42.936 --> 01:40:44.405
CONTINUOUSLY AND ROLLED A?

01:40:44.471 --> 01:40:45.973
TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAM THEY

01:40:46.039 --> 01:40:47.307
ARE THE PEOPLE ON EMERGENCY

01:40:47.374 --> 01:40:48.709
PERMIT DON'T QUALIFY TO GET INTO

01:40:48.776 --> 01:40:50.477
A TEACHER AT PROGRAM THEY HAVE

01:40:50.544 --> 01:40:51.779
TO HAVE A BACCALAUREATE DEGREE

01:40:51.845 --> 01:40:53.247
THEY HAVE TO ADMIT THEIR BASIC

01:40:53.313 --> 01:40:54.181
SKILLS REQUIREMENT.

01:40:54.248 --> 01:40:55.749
BUT THEY TYPICALLY HAVE NOT

01:40:55.816 --> 01:40:56.917
COMPLETED THEIR ABOUT THEIR

01:40:56.984 --> 01:40:58.619
SUBJECT MATTER REQUIREMENT THEY

01:40:58.685 --> 01:41:00.154
HAVE TO HAVE DEMONSTRATED THEY

01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:00.788
KNOW THE SUBJECT MATTER THEY'RE

01:41:00.854 --> 01:41:02.423
GOING TO TEACH WE HAVE A TESTING

01:41:02.489 --> 01:41:04.558
PROGRAM FOR THAT WE HAVE PROGRAM

01:41:04.625 --> 01:41:05.993
OPPORTUNITIES TO COMPLETE THAT.

01:41:06.059 --> 01:41:07.361
THESE PEOPLE WERE HIRED BECAUSE

01:41:07.428 --> 01:41:08.562
THERE'S AN IMMEDIATE NEED AT A

01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:10.764
LOCAL SCHOOL WHERE SOMEONE WITH

01:41:10.831 --> 01:41:11.865
THE CREDENTIAL COULD NOT BE

01:41:11.932 --> 01:41:13.700
FOUND THESE ARE FOLKS WITH IT

01:41:13.767 --> 01:41:14.168
DID YOU SAY WITHOUT A

01:41:14.234 --> 01:41:15.135
BACCALAUREATE DEGREE SO THEY

01:41:15.202 --> 01:41:16.804
HAVE TO HAVE A BACCALAUREATE

01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:17.404
DEGREE TO BE AN EMERGENCY TO

01:41:17.471 --> 01:41:17.671
REMEMBER.

01:41:17.738 --> 01:41:19.940
BUT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY TEACHER

01:41:20.007 --> 01:41:22.042
TRAINING AT ALL ON THE DISTRICT

01:41:22.109 --> 01:41:24.711
SUPERVISORS THEM AND THEY THEY

01:41:24.778 --> 01:41:26.079
ARE WORKING TO GET THEIR SUBJECT

01:41:26.146 --> 01:41:27.815
MATTER REQUIREMENT MET.

01:41:27.881 --> 01:41:29.283
SO THEY CAN THEN AND ROLL EITHER

01:41:29.349 --> 01:41:32.085
IN AN INTERN PROGRAM OR IN A

01:41:32.152 --> 01:41:33.720
TEACHING BASED PROGRAM -- BUT

01:41:33.787 --> 01:41:34.988
THAT'S TWENTY SIX HUNDRED

01:41:35.055 --> 01:41:36.056
CLASSROOMS WITH SPECIAL

01:41:36.123 --> 01:41:41.662
EDUCATION TEACHERS WHO ARE NOT

01:41:41.728 --> 01:41:43.363
PREPARED.

01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:44.264
TO AND AND HAVEN'T HAD

01:41:44.331 --> 01:41:45.566
EXPERIENCE DOING IT.

01:41:45.632 --> 01:41:47.267
THAT'S SIGNIFICANT SO -- IF WE

01:41:47.334 --> 01:41:48.669
BRING TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED

01:41:48.735 --> 01:41:49.269
SPECIAL EDUCATORS IN THROUGH

01:41:49.336 --> 01:41:49.903
RESIDENCIES WHICH WE EXPECT TO

01:41:49.970 --> 01:41:50.704
DO OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS THAT

01:41:50.771 --> 01:41:51.405
HELPS.

01:41:51.472 --> 01:41:53.774
BUT YOU KNOW IT'S THAT THE

01:41:53.841 --> 01:41:56.210
SITUATION IS ISRAEL THAT'S

01:41:56.276 --> 01:41:58.412
THAT'S REALLY WHERE WE ARE WITH

01:41:58.479 --> 01:41:58.612
THIS.

01:41:58.679 --> 01:42:00.314
MMHM.

01:42:00.380 --> 01:42:00.881
SO THAT THAT MAY BE ENOUGH

01:42:00.948 --> 01:42:01.915
UNLESS YOU HAVE SPECIFIC

01:42:01.982 --> 01:42:03.383
QUESTIONS FOR ME THAT THAT YOU'D

01:42:03.450 --> 01:42:05.719
LIKE ME TO ELABORATE ON I'M

01:42:05.786 --> 01:42:08.789
HAPPY TO DO SO -- TEXTUAL

01:42:08.856 --> 01:42:10.424
PRESENTATION THANK YOU

01:42:10.491 --> 01:42:10.724
[inaudible]

01:42:10.791 --> 01:42:14.027
HELLO.

01:42:14.094 --> 01:42:15.629
I GUESS WE WANTED TO START BY

01:42:15.696 --> 01:42:17.264
TAKING A QUICK STEP BACK SO WHEN

01:42:17.331 --> 01:42:18.398
TALKING ABOUT THEIR SPECIAL

01:42:18.465 --> 01:42:19.933
EDUCATION TEACHER SHORTAGE THERE

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.369
REALLY THREE UNDERLYING FACTORS.

01:42:22.436 --> 01:42:25.038
FIRST IS DEMAND FOR TEACHERS HOW

01:42:25.105 --> 01:42:26.273
MANY TEACHERS DO SCHOOL

01:42:26.340 --> 01:42:27.841
DISTRICTS NEED IN OUR CLASSROOMS

01:42:27.908 --> 01:42:28.909
ONE RELEVANT FACTOR FOR SPECIAL

01:42:28.976 --> 01:42:31.111
EDUCATION IS THAT THE NUMBER OF

01:42:31.178 --> 01:42:32.713
STUDENTS IDENTIFIED WITH SPECIAL

01:42:32.779 --> 01:42:34.715
NEEDS HAS BEEN RISING OVER THE

01:42:34.781 --> 01:42:35.048
PAST DECADE.

01:42:35.115 --> 01:42:36.316
AND SO THERE'S BEEN HIGHER

01:42:36.383 --> 01:42:38.185
DEMAND FOR SUCH TEACHERS SECOND

01:42:38.252 --> 01:42:39.620
A SECOND FACTOR IS TEACHER

01:42:39.686 --> 01:42:40.754
SUPPLY.

01:42:40.821 --> 01:42:42.022
HOW MANY CREDENTIALED TEACHERS

01:42:42.089 --> 01:42:43.257
ARE NEWLY ENTERING OR RE

01:42:43.323 --> 01:42:44.892
ENTERING THE CLASSROOM THIS

01:42:44.958 --> 01:42:45.893
INCLUDES NEARLY CREDENTIALED

01:42:45.959 --> 01:42:47.394
TEACHERS TEACHERS RE ENTERING

01:42:47.461 --> 01:42:49.096
THE WORK FORCE AND TEACHERS

01:42:49.162 --> 01:42:50.330
COMING FROM OU OF STATE?

01:42:50.397 --> 01:42:52.633
LASTLY IS TEACHER TURNOVER HOW

01:42:52.699 --> 01:42:53.534
MANY TEACHERS ARE LEAVING THE

01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:54.968
CLASSROOM THIS MAY INCLUDE

01:42:55.035 --> 01:42:56.436
TEACHERS LEAVING THE PROFESSION

01:42:56.503 --> 01:42:58.438
ALTOGETHER SWITCHING DISTRICTS

01:42:58.505 --> 01:43:00.908
LEAVING THE STATE OR RETIRING.

01:43:00.974 --> 01:43:02.109
AND SO TEACHER SHORTAGE WILL

01:43:02.175 --> 01:43:04.411
RESULTS WHEN AND THE DEMANDS FOR

01:43:04.478 --> 01:43:05.212
TEACHERS IS HIGHER THAN THE

01:43:05.279 --> 01:43:08.515
SUPPLY OR THERE'S HIGH TURNOVR.

01:43:08.582 --> 01:43:09.049
ONE WAY TO MEASURE OF THAT

01:43:09.116 --> 01:43:10.050
SHORTAGE IS TO LOOK AT THE

01:43:10.117 --> 01:43:11.518
NUMBER OF TEACHERS THAT IN A

01:43:11.585 --> 01:43:13.520
GIVEN FIELD ON EMERGENCY PERMITS

01:43:13.587 --> 01:43:15.622
AS WE JUST DISCUSSED.

01:43:15.689 --> 01:43:18.825
IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN

01:43:18.892 --> 01:43:19.459
SEVENTEEN FOR EVERY ONE HUNDRED

01:43:19.526 --> 01:43:20.761
SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER IN THE

01:43:20.827 --> 01:43:22.663
CLASSROOM THERE WERE SIX

01:43:22.729 --> 01:43:24.197
TEACHERS ON EMERGENCY COMMENTS

01:43:24.264 --> 01:43:28.902
WHICH IS A HIGHER RATIO THAN ANY

01:43:28.969 --> 01:43:30.003
OTHER SUBJECT AREA.

01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:30.671
LAST YEAR OUR OFFICE ANALYZE THE

01:43:30.737 --> 01:43:31.838
SPECIAL EDUCATION STAFFING

01:43:31.905 --> 01:43:33.206
SHORTAGE AND IDENTIFIED THREE

01:43:33.273 --> 01:43:34.241
SPECIFIC STEPS THAT.

01:43:34.308 --> 01:43:36.777
COULD HELP ADDRESS AT FIRST THE

01:43:36.843 --> 01:43:38.245
LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER

01:43:38.312 --> 01:43:39.713
SIGNALING TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO

01:43:39.780 --> 01:43:42.082
PROVIDE A STRONGER PAY INCENTIVE

01:43:42.149 --> 01:43:43.617
FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS.

01:43:43.684 --> 01:43:44.618
SCHOOL DISTRICTS GENERALLY DO

01:43:44.685 --> 01:43:46.019
NOT PROVIDE DIFFERENTIAL PAY

01:43:46.086 --> 01:43:48.455
LEVELS BETWEEN GENERAL EDUCATION

01:43:48.522 --> 01:43:49.690
AND SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS

01:43:49.756 --> 01:43:51.058
HOWEVER SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:43:51.124 --> 01:43:51.692
TEACHERS TYPICALLY HAVE

01:43:51.758 --> 01:43:53.627
ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES SUCH

01:43:53.694 --> 01:43:55.362
AS DEVELOPING -- TIME CONSUMING

01:43:55.429 --> 01:43:56.964
I YOU KEYS AND COORDINATING

01:43:57.030 --> 01:43:58.999
TEAMS OF SPECIALISTS TO PROVIDE

01:43:59.066 --> 01:44:00.267
STUDENT SERVICES.

01:44:00.334 --> 01:44:01.868
THOUGH PROVIDING DIFFERENTIAL

01:44:01.935 --> 01:44:04.004
PAY IS TYPICALLY A LOCAL

01:44:04.071 --> 01:44:05.806
DECISION THAT IS NEGOTIATED

01:44:05.872 --> 01:44:06.273
THROUGH THE COLLECTIVE

01:44:06.340 --> 01:44:08.175
BARGAINING PROCESS WE BELIEVE

01:44:08.241 --> 01:44:09.810
THE LEGISLATURE COULD SIGNAL ITS

01:44:09.876 --> 01:44:11.378
SUPPORT FOR DIRECT DFFERENTIAL

01:44:11.445 --> 01:44:12.145
PAY.

01:44:12.212 --> 01:44:13.614
BY REPEALING AN EXISTING

01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:16.016
STATUTORY PROVISION THAT SETS A

01:44:16.083 --> 01:44:17.184
UNIFORM SALARY SCHEDULE AS A

01:44:17.250 --> 01:44:20.120
DEFAULT DISTRICT POLICY.

01:44:20.187 --> 01:44:21.655
SECOND WE NEED THE LEGISLATURE

01:44:21.722 --> 01:44:23.557
COULD CONSIDER STREAMLINING BOTH

01:44:23.624 --> 01:44:24.591
PRESIDENTIAL STRUCTURE TO ALLOW

01:44:24.658 --> 01:44:26.059
SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS TO

01:44:26.126 --> 01:44:27.494
TEACH STUDENTS WITH MORE TYPES

01:44:27.561 --> 01:44:28.996
OF DISABILITIES WITHOUT HAVING

01:44:29.062 --> 01:44:30.030
TO ATTAIN A SECOND TEACHING

01:44:30.097 --> 01:44:31.098
CREDENTIAL.

01:44:31.164 --> 01:44:32.766
CURRENTLY TEACHERS WORKING WITH

01:44:32.833 --> 01:44:34.134
STUDENTS WITH MILD TO MODERATE

01:44:34.201 --> 01:44:36.103
DISABILITIES REQUIRE A DIFFERENT

01:44:36.169 --> 01:44:37.371
CREDENTIAL IN THOSE WERE

01:44:37.437 --> 01:44:40.340
STUDENTS WITH A MORE EXPENSIVE

01:44:40.407 --> 01:44:41.341
MARKS EXPENSIVE.

01:44:41.408 --> 01:44:42.576
SUPPORT NEEDS CONSOLIDATING

01:44:42.643 --> 01:44:43.877
THESE CREDENTIALS COULD HELP

01:44:43.944 --> 01:44:44.678
THOSE INTERESTED IN COMING

01:44:44.745 --> 01:44:46.179
SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS MORE

01:44:46.246 --> 01:44:50.817
EASILY NAVIGATE THE CREDENTIAL

01:44:50.884 --> 01:44:52.319
STRUCTURE.

01:44:52.386 --> 01:44:52.552
LASTLY.

01:44:52.619 --> 01:44:53.520
WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE

01:44:53.587 --> 01:44:53.787
PROVIDE.

01:44:53.854 --> 01:44:54.721
FUNDING FOR CSU TO EXPAND

01:44:54.788 --> 01:44:56.323
TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR CERTAIN

01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:57.924
TYPES OF SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:44:57.991 --> 01:44:59.226
SPECIALIST.

01:44:59.292 --> 01:45:00.994
ACCORDING TURN OUNCES THIS THIS

01:45:01.061 --> 01:45:03.764
SHORTAGE IS PARTICULARLY ACUTE

01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:05.132
FOR SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGISTS

01:45:05.198 --> 01:45:06.500
CURRENTLY SPEECH LANGUAGE

01:45:06.566 --> 01:45:08.301
PATHOLOGISTS MAY BE TRAINED AT

01:45:08.368 --> 01:45:09.770
ONE OF THE THIRTEEN CSU CAMPUS

01:45:09.836 --> 01:45:12.239
AS WE SPOKE WITH.

01:45:12.305 --> 01:45:14.908
ADMINISTRATORS AT THESE CAMPUSES

01:45:14.975 --> 01:45:15.509
AND LEARNS THAT MORE STUDENTS

01:45:15.575 --> 01:45:17.844
WERE.

01:45:17.911 --> 01:45:21.081
IN A ROLLING AND I PARTICIPATING

01:45:21.148 --> 01:45:21.715
IN THESE PROGRAMS AND THEY CAN

01:45:21.782 --> 01:45:22.549
ACCEPT.

01:45:22.616 --> 01:45:23.984
GIVEN THE HIGH DEMAND FOR THE

01:45:24.051 --> 01:45:26.119
SPECIALIST BY SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:45:26.186 --> 01:45:27.387
WE BELIEVE CSU COULD INCREASE

01:45:27.454 --> 01:45:29.089
ENROLLMENT IN SPEECH LANGUAGE

01:45:29.156 --> 01:45:31.591
PATHOLOGY PROGRAMS BY ABOUT 5%

01:45:31.658 --> 01:45:33.493
IN NINETEEN TWENTY WITH

01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:34.761
ADDITIONAL ENROLLMENT FUNDING.

01:45:34.828 --> 01:45:35.495
WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE

01:45:35.562 --> 01:45:37.397
COULD'VE PROVIDE SEVEN HUNDRED

01:45:37.464 --> 01:45:38.665
AND FIFTY THOUSAND PER CSU TO

01:45:38.732 --> 01:45:40.634
EXPAND SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY

01:45:40.701 --> 01:45:42.436
GRADUATE PROGRAMS TO HELP REDUCE

01:45:42.502 --> 01:45:44.738
THIS ACUTE STAFFING SHORTAGE IN

01:45:44.805 --> 01:45:45.639
THIS AREA.

01:45:45.706 --> 01:45:46.707
THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS THANK

01:45:46.773 --> 01:45:48.975
YOU WILL IS THE DIFFICULT T. AT

01:45:49.042 --> 01:45:51.011
THE C. ISSUE CAMPUSES IS THE

01:45:51.078 --> 01:45:53.814
LIMITING FACTOR.

01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:55.382
ENROLLMENT FUNDING.

01:45:55.449 --> 01:45:57.451
OF CAPITAL ISSUES HAVING TO DO

01:45:57.517 --> 01:45:59.486
WITH CLASSROOMS OR IS IT.

01:45:59.553 --> 01:46:01.755
OF THE AVAILABILITY OF QUALIFIED

01:46:01.822 --> 01:46:03.657
FACULTY TO TEACH COURSE

01:46:03.724 --> 01:46:03.957
[inaudible]

01:46:04.024 --> 01:46:05.892
IN SOME.

01:46:05.959 --> 01:46:08.695
SOME FIELDS SUCH AS NURSING IT'S

01:46:08.762 --> 01:46:10.530
MY RECOLLECTION ANYWAY THAT. ONE

01:46:10.597 --> 01:46:12.165
OF THE LIMITING FACTORS WAS THE

01:46:12.232 --> 01:46:14.935
AVAILABILITY OF OF IT'S NOT A

01:46:15.001 --> 01:46:16.536
PHD BUT IT'S THE NURSING

01:46:16.603 --> 01:46:17.838
DOCTORATE.

01:46:17.904 --> 01:46:19.072
THE QUALIFIED INSTRUCTORS

01:46:19.139 --> 01:46:20.474
INSTRUCTORS TO TEACH NURSING

01:46:20.540 --> 01:46:23.210
COURSES IS THAT THE CASE WITH

01:46:23.276 --> 01:46:25.479
RESPECT TO OF SPEECH ABOUT.

01:46:25.545 --> 01:46:26.246
SO FOR SPEECH PATHOLOGY IT

01:46:26.313 --> 01:46:27.914
REALLY IS A COMBINATION OF THOSE

01:46:27.981 --> 01:46:28.749
FACTORS.

01:46:28.815 --> 01:46:33.220
BECAUSE OF POOR THERE IS A THERE

01:46:33.286 --> 01:46:34.187
IS AN LECTURE BASED COMPONENT

01:46:34.254 --> 01:46:34.821
FOR THESE PROGRAMS AND THERE'S

01:46:34.888 --> 01:46:36.656
ALSO A CLINICAL COMPONENT FOR

01:46:36.723 --> 01:46:38.225
THESE PROGRAMS AND FOR SPEECH

01:46:38.291 --> 01:46:40.227
LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY THE RATIO

01:46:40.293 --> 01:46:42.028
THAT YOU HAVE FOR A SUPERVISOR

01:46:42.095 --> 01:46:43.263
TO STUDENT IS THREE TO ONE WHICH

01:46:43.330 --> 01:46:43.530
IS.

01:46:43.597 --> 01:46:44.831
MUCH LOWER THAN IN OTHER

01:46:44.898 --> 01:46:46.433
PROGRAMS AND SO IN TERMS OF

01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:47.567
EXPANDING THESE PROGRAMS THAT

01:46:47.634 --> 01:46:50.570
ACTUALLY DOES TAKE MORE FUNDING --

01:46:50.637 --> 01:46:51.772
TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL SPOT TO THE

01:46:51.838 --> 01:46:52.739
SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY

01:46:52.806 --> 01:46:54.274
PROGRAMS THAN TO OTHER

01:46:54.341 --> 01:46:55.776
SPECIALISTS GRADUATE PROGRAMS

01:46:55.842 --> 01:46:57.444
WITHIN THEIR THAT'S ONE FACTOR

01:46:57.511 --> 01:46:58.779
THAT I LIMITED FOR OMITTED FROM

01:46:58.845 --> 01:47:00.881
MY LIST AND THAT'S THE

01:47:00.947 --> 01:47:02.082
AVAILABILITY OF CLINICAL SLIDES.

01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:03.617
WHICH I GUESS IS ALSO A LIMITING

01:47:03.683 --> 01:47:05.752
FACTOR IN THE OTHER.

01:47:05.819 --> 01:47:07.120
HEALTH AND ALLIED HEALTH

01:47:07.187 --> 01:47:08.421
PROFESSIONAL TRAINING PROGRAMS

01:47:08.488 --> 01:47:10.490
AS WELL WE ALSO FIND THAT TO BE

01:47:10.557 --> 01:47:12.259
A LIMITING FACTOR WITH SPEECH

01:47:12.325 --> 01:47:14.628
LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY AS WELL --

01:47:14.694 --> 01:47:17.664
BECAUSE YOU SO IN ORDER TO

01:47:17.731 --> 01:47:21.968
RECEIVE YOUR CERTIFICATION YOU

01:47:22.035 --> 01:47:23.136
NEED A FAIR NUMBER OF HOURS THAT.

01:47:23.203 --> 01:47:24.070
WHERE YOU WORK IN A CLINIC WITH

01:47:24.137 --> 01:47:24.905
ADULTS AND ALSO WITH CHILDREN

01:47:24.971 --> 01:47:26.373
AND SO FINDING PLACEMENTS

01:47:26.439 --> 01:47:27.741
WORKING WITH ADULT IS ACTUALLY

01:47:27.808 --> 01:47:29.609
QUITE CHALLENGING -- IN TERMS OF

01:47:29.676 --> 01:47:30.844
WORKING WITH CHILDREN SCHOOL

01:47:30.911 --> 01:47:32.279
DISTRICTS CAN EASILY ACCEPT

01:47:32.345 --> 01:47:33.780
SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGIST

01:47:33.847 --> 01:47:36.416
INTERNS AND AB THOUGHT AND THEY

01:47:36.483 --> 01:47:37.551
CAN RECEIVE THEIR HOURS THAT WAY.

01:47:37.617 --> 01:47:39.019
BUT WORKING WITH ADULTS SEEMS TO

01:47:39.085 --> 01:47:40.353
BE MORE CHALLENGING SEEMS TO BE

01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:43.023
MORE LIMITING FACTOR -- AND IN

01:47:43.089 --> 01:47:43.690
IN ADDITION TO THIS

01:47:43.757 --> 01:47:46.126
RECOMMENDATION WE ACTUALLY WOULD

01:47:46.193 --> 01:47:46.993
RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE

01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:48.895
CONSIDERING PROVIDING FUNDING ON

01:47:48.962 --> 01:47:50.764
A COMPETITIVE GRANT BASIS BASIS

01:47:50.831 --> 01:47:53.800
AND SO CSU CAMPUSES WOULD HAVE.

01:47:53.867 --> 01:47:55.168
TO PROVIDE ARTICULATION AS TO

01:47:55.235 --> 01:47:56.670
HOW THEY PLAN TO ADDRESS THESE

01:47:56.736 --> 01:47:58.705
DRAWBACKS AND LIMITATIONS ON

01:47:58.772 --> 01:48:00.740
EXPANDING THEIR THEIR PROGRAMS

01:48:00.807 --> 01:48:01.474
IS WHAT I'VE FOUND IS THE

01:48:01.541 --> 01:48:05.412
CLINICAL SLOT ISSUES DIFFICULT

01:48:05.478 --> 01:48:08.081
FOR US -- AT THE STATE LEVEL TO

01:48:08.148 --> 01:48:09.049
IMPACT.

01:48:09.115 --> 01:48:11.551
AS A CLINICAL **** SERVER ARE

01:48:11.618 --> 01:48:13.787
OFTEN PROVIDED BY -- FOLKS OTHER

01:48:13.854 --> 01:48:14.554
THAN STATE GOVERNMENT SO.

01:48:14.621 --> 01:48:15.322
THERE IS THE ISSUE OF SLOTS IN

01:48:15.388 --> 01:48:16.756
WHOSE FUNDING THEM AND WHERE

01:48:16.823 --> 01:48:18.425
THEY ARE AND TO BE IN THE

01:48:18.491 --> 01:48:20.227
PRIVATE SECTOR IN WHOSE

01:48:20.293 --> 01:48:22.095
COMPETING FOR THE BOTH IN THE

01:48:22.162 --> 01:48:23.096
PRIVATE SECTOR -- PRIVATE

01:48:23.163 --> 01:48:24.865
INSTITUTIONS NOT FOR PROFIT

JUST JUST UNDER 2% WHICH DOESN'T

01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:39.306
SEEM LIKE A HUGE AMOUNT.

CASES WHERE THE DEPARTMENT CAN

02:13:00.439 --> 02:13:02.407
DIRECTLY INTERVENE -- BUT IT FOR

02:13:02.474 --> 02:13:04.276

02:13:15.087 --> 02:13:16.722
PROGRAMS IN OFFICES WORKING

02:13:16.788 --> 02:13:18.056
ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT ON THESE

02:13:18.123 --> 02:13:19.825
TYPES OF APPEALS.

02:13:19.891 --> 02:13:20.992
THE DEPARTMENT FELT IT WAS

02:13:21.059 --> 02:13:22.728
IMPORTANT SEVERAL YEARS AGO THAT

ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT EVERYONE

02:13:27.099 --> 02:13:28.333

02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:29.634
TO INCREASE.

02:13:29.701 --> 02:13:31.503

CAN DO THAT AS YOU'RE AWARE

02:13:41.646 --> 02:13:43.682
THERE WAS AN AUDIT IN TWENTY

02:13:43.749 --> 02:13:44.483
SEVENTEEN THAT ALSO HAD SOME

02:13:44.549 --> 02:13:47.686
RECOMMENDATIONS -- PRIOR -- TO

02:13:47.753 --> 02:13:49.388
THE AUDIT WE HAD TALKED ABOUT

02:13:49.454 --> 02:13:50.856
CONSTRUCTING OR DEVELOPING A

02:13:50.922 --> 02:13:52.624
CENTRAL TRACKING SYSTEM WITHIN

02:13:52.691 --> 02:13:54.693

02:14:02.801 --> 02:14:03.935
THAT WE WOULD HAVE A CENTRAL

SYSTEM FOR TRACKING AND LOGGING

02:14:06.471 --> 02:14:07.205

RECOMMENDATIONS WAS THAT WE

WHICH YOU CAN CONSTRUCT A

02:14:26.124 --> 02:14:27.993
CENTRAL TRACKING SYSTEM AND WE

02:14:28.059 --> 02:14:29.828
WERE ABLE TO DO THAT AN AS OF

02:14:29.895 --> 02:14:31.363
OCTOBER.

02:14:31.430 --> 02:14:32.230
TWENTY SEVENTEEN ALL PROGRAM

02:14:32.297 --> 02:14:33.832
OFFICES WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT

ENTERED THEIR DATE AND

02:14:34.866 --> 02:14:36.435
EVERYTHING IS LOGGED INTO ONE

02:14:36.501 --> 02:14:39.805
CENTRAL TRACKING OFFICE.

02:14:39.871 --> 02:14:42.374
AND WE ALSO CONTINUED -- AS PART

02:14:42.441 --> 02:14:45.143
OF SB EIGHT FORTY TO ENGAGE IN A

02:14:45.210 --> 02:14:48.880
STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND WE THIS

02:14:48.947 --> 02:14:49.915
IS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE

02:14:49.981 --> 02:14:51.316
DEPARTMENT HAS DONE THIS --

02:14:51.383 --> 02:14:53.285
REGARDING THE UCP SO WE WERE

02:14:53.351 --> 02:14:54.853
REALLY EXCITED AND WANT TO MAKE

02:14:54.920 --> 02:14:56.655
SURE THAT WE ANSWERED AND ASK

02:14:56.721 --> 02:14:58.390
THE RIGHT QUESTIONS SO WE DID

02:14:58.457 --> 02:15:00.425
HOLD PRE MEETINGS PREVIOUSLY

02:15:00.492 --> 02:15:01.693
WITH A SMALL GROUP.

02:15:01.760 --> 02:15:03.295
OF STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE SURE

02:15:03.361 --> 02:15:03.895
THAT WE WERE ASKING THE RIGHT

02:15:03.962 --> 02:15:05.864
QUESTIONS WHAT WE FOUND DURING

02:15:05.931 --> 02:15:08.200
THE SPREE STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS

02:15:08.266 --> 02:15:09.668
WAS THAT THERE WAS A GENERAL

02:15:09.734 --> 02:15:10.969
LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OR

02:15:11.036 --> 02:15:13.438
INFORMATION RELATIVE TO WHAT THE

02:15:13.505 --> 02:15:15.474
UC P. IS AND WHAT IT IS NOT.

02:15:15.540 --> 02:15:17.175
WHAT PROGRAMS ARE INCLUDED IN

02:15:17.242 --> 02:15:19.544
THE U. P. AND THIS IS AT ALL

02:15:19.611 --> 02:15:21.112
LEVELS OF THE PARENT LEVEL PLUS

02:15:21.179 --> 02:15:23.348
YOU -- PARENTS AND SCHOOL

02:15:23.415 --> 02:15:26.051
DISTRICTS -- AND THERE WAS ALSO

02:15:26.117 --> 02:15:27.686
A FEELING OF THAT DAY AT THE

02:15:27.752 --> 02:15:30.121
STATE LEVEL IS VERY COMPLEX AND

02:15:30.188 --> 02:15:32.924
CONFUSING FOR INDIVIDUALS -- WE

02:15:32.991 --> 02:15:34.526
THEN DECIDED THAT WE NEEDED TO

02:15:34.593 --> 02:15:35.927
FOCUS OUR QUESTIONS ON THE

02:15:35.994 --> 02:15:37.629
GENERAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE U.

02:15:37.696 --> 02:15:39.331
C. P. AS WELL AS WHAT AVAILABLE

02:15:39.397 --> 02:15:40.832
RESOURCES AND TECHNICAL

02:15:40.899 --> 02:15:41.533
ASSISTANCE.

02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:44.069
ARE AVAILABLE TO PARENTS AND TO

02:15:44.135 --> 02:15:48.540
ADMINISTRATORS AND TEACHERS AT A

02:15:48.607 --> 02:15:50.141
LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT LEVEL.

02:15:50.208 --> 02:15:50.709
AND SO ARE QUESTIONS REALLY

02:15:50.775 --> 02:15:52.277
REVOLVED AROUND THE CLARITY OF

02:15:52.344 --> 02:15:53.178
THE UC.

02:15:53.245 --> 02:15:54.679
WHAT INFORMATION DO PEOPLE KNOW

02:15:54.746 --> 02:15:56.848
ABOUT THE UC WHAT IS IT THAT

02:15:56.915 --> 02:15:57.983
THEY WOULD LIKE TO NOW?

02:15:58.049 --> 02:15:59.451
AND THE SECOND WAS ABOUT THE

02:15:59.518 --> 02:16:01.119
UNIFORM AND CONSISTENCY

02:16:01.186 --> 02:16:02.387
UNIFORMITY.

02:16:02.454 --> 02:16:03.889
WHAT WERE THEIR THOUGHTS ABOUT

02:16:03.955 --> 02:16:05.857
THE UNIFORMITY WHAT WOULD THEY

02:16:05.924 --> 02:16:08.426
LIKE TO SEE RELATIVE TO THAT?

02:16:08.493 --> 02:16:10.095
AND THE THIRD AREA WAS WHAT

02:16:10.161 --> 02:16:11.930
AVAILABLE GUIDANCE AND TECHNICAL

02:16:11.997 --> 02:16:13.632
ASSISTANCE IS OUT THERE.

02:16:13.698 --> 02:16:14.866
AND SO THOSE WERE THE THREE

02:16:14.933 --> 02:16:16.234
AREAS WE ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT

02:16:16.301 --> 02:16:18.303
THAT WHAT WE FOUND WAS VERY

02:16:18.370 --> 02:16:19.905
SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DISCOVERED IN

02:16:19.971 --> 02:16:21.606
OUR PRE MEETINGS.

02:16:21.673 --> 02:16:23.008
AND THAT IS THAT THE

02:16:23.074 --> 02:16:24.442
STAKEHOLDERS REALLY STRESS A

02:16:24.509 --> 02:16:26.378
GENERAL LACK OF CLARITY AROUND

02:16:26.444 --> 02:16:27.746
THE U. C. P..

02:16:27.812 --> 02:16:29.648
AND THIS REALLY INCLUDED --

02:16:29.714 --> 02:16:30.916
REGARDING THE ROLES AND

02:16:30.982 --> 02:16:33.685
RESPONSIBILITIES AT THE STATE

02:16:33.752 --> 02:16:36.187
AND THE LOCAL LEVEL -- CLARITY

02:16:36.254 --> 02:16:37.856
REGARDING THE PURPOSE OF THE UC

02:16:37.923 --> 02:16:40.225
P. I'M THE INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS

02:16:40.292 --> 02:16:43.595
AND TIME LINES SO IN ALL ASPECTS

02:16:43.662 --> 02:16:45.964
OF THE UC P. -- THAT THERE WAS A

02:16:46.031 --> 02:16:47.732
NEED FOR MORE UNIFORMITY AND

02:16:47.799 --> 02:16:50.101
CONSISTENCY FOR PROCESSING OF

02:16:50.168 --> 02:16:51.770
COMPLAINTS AND APPEALS.

02:16:51.836 --> 02:16:52.571
I'M.

02:16:52.637 --> 02:16:54.506
SPECIFICALLY THAT THERE NEEDED

02:16:54.573 --> 02:16:56.007
TO BE CLEAR EXPECTATIONS IN THE

02:16:56.074 --> 02:16:57.742
PROCESS THE PARENTS REALLY

02:16:57.809 --> 02:16:59.978
NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

02:17:00.045 --> 02:17:01.513
STEPS WERE INVOLVED IN WITH THE

02:17:01.580 --> 02:17:01.880
TIME.

02:17:01.947 --> 02:17:03.081
SWORE THAT THEY NEEDED TO BE

02:17:03.148 --> 02:17:05.116
CONSISTENT BOTH AT A LOCAL LEVEL

02:17:05.183 --> 02:17:06.985
AND STATE LEVEL AND AS A YOU

02:17:07.052 --> 02:17:09.020
KNOW RECENTLY -- THERE WAS

02:17:09.087 --> 02:17:10.589
LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED THAT

02:17:10.655 --> 02:17:12.557
REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO ALSO

02:17:12.624 --> 02:17:14.960
HAVE A SIXTY DAY TIMELINE WHICH

02:17:15.026 --> 02:17:16.661
IS THE SAME TIMELINE THAT

02:17:16.728 --> 02:17:18.430
DISTRICTS HAVE SO THAT IS IN AN

02:17:18.496 --> 02:17:22.400
EFFORT TO BECOME A MORE UNIFORM.

02:17:22.467 --> 02:17:24.002
THE BIGGEST WAS THAT THERE WAS A

02:17:24.069 --> 02:17:25.904
NEED FOR GUIDANCE AND TECHNICAL

02:17:25.971 --> 02:17:28.940
ASSISTANCE AND LOCAL LEVEL --

02:17:29.007 --> 02:17:30.842
THIS INCLUDED TRAINING FOR

02:17:30.909 --> 02:17:32.544
ADMINISTRATORS ARE CONDUCTING

02:17:32.611 --> 02:17:34.980
INVESTIGATIONS -- WE ALSO FOUND

02:17:35.046 --> 02:17:36.081
THAT THERE WAS A HIGH TURNOVER

02:17:36.147 --> 02:17:37.515
RATE AND SOMETIMES IN THE

02:17:37.582 --> 02:17:40.051
ADMINISTRATORS THAT ARE.

02:17:40.118 --> 02:17:41.553
PLACED WITH THIS RESPONSIBILITY --

02:17:41.620 --> 02:17:42.887
THAT THEY'RE ALSO NEEDED TO BE

02:17:42.954 --> 02:17:45.390
THINGS LIKE RESOURCES FAQS

02:17:45.457 --> 02:17:48.860
TEMPLATES -- ANY TYPE OF GODLY

02:17:48.927 --> 02:17:52.297
GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS.

02:17:52.364 --> 02:17:54.566
SO OVERALL WE FOUND IT --

02:17:54.633 --> 02:17:56.534
STAKEHOLDERS FELT IT WAS COMPLEX

02:17:56.601 --> 02:17:58.770
CONFUSING AND INCONSISTENT AND

02:17:58.837 --> 02:18:00.005
THAT THERE WAS A DISCONNECT

02:18:00.071 --> 02:18:02.140
BETWEEN THE STATE LEVEL AND THE

02:18:02.207 --> 02:18:03.208
LOCAL LEVEL.

02:18:03.274 --> 02:18:05.710
SO IN RESPONSE TO THAT WE FELT

02:18:05.777 --> 02:18:07.412
THAT WE NEEDED TO DO SOMETHING.

02:18:07.479 --> 02:18:09.614
AND TO DO SOMETHING DRASTIC AND

02:18:09.681 --> 02:18:11.883
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE I'M

02:18:11.950 --> 02:18:13.551
ALSO ARE DOING AS PART OF A

02:18:13.618 --> 02:18:15.487
RESPONSE TO THIS IS CREATING A

02:18:15.553 --> 02:18:16.655
CENTRAL OFFICE WITHIN THE

02:18:16.721 --> 02:18:17.789
DEPARTMENT.

02:18:17.856 --> 02:18:19.157
SO WE'RE RESEARCHING CURRENTLY

02:18:19.224 --> 02:18:20.392
WEIGHS ABOUT HOW WE CAN TO

02:18:20.458 --> 02:18:22.761
RESTRUCTURE OUR OFFICES IN OUR

STAFFING TO THAT WE CAN STAFF.

02:18:24.129 --> 02:18:26.564
A CENTRAL OFFICE APPROPRIATELY

02:18:26.631 --> 02:18:29.100
THIS OFFICE WOULD RECEIVE AND

02:18:29.167 --> 02:18:30.468
PROCESS ALL APPEALS AND

02:18:30.535 --> 02:18:32.270
COMPLAINTS SO THERE WOULD BE ONE

02:18:32.337 --> 02:18:34.172
OFFICE WHERE IS IN THE PAST

02:18:34.239 --> 02:18:35.607
COMPLAINTS ARE DISTRICTS WOULD

02:18:35.674 --> 02:18:37.242

02:18:54.225 --> 02:18:55.660
IN ADDITION TO THAT WE TOOK THE

02:18:55.727 --> 02:18:58.029

IN PLACE BY JANUARY OF TWENTY

02:19:54.719 --> 02:19:56.054
TWENTY I'M IN RESPECT TO OUR

02:19:56.121 --> 02:19:57.756
CENTRAL OFFICE WE WORKING ON

02:19:57.822 --> 02:19:58.590
THAT WE EXPECT.

THAT WILL BE COMPLETED WITHIN

02:20:00.925 --> 02:20:03.495
THREE TO SIX MONTHS -- IN

02:20:03.561 --> 02:20:05.163
ADDITION TO THAT WE WANTED TO

02:20:05.230 --> 02:20:07.465
CREATE A MULTI FACETED TECHNICAL

02:20:07.532 --> 02:20:09.467
ASSISTANCE APPROACH -- WE

02:20:09.534 --> 02:20:10.702
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A GREAT

02:20:10.769 --> 02:20:13.705
NEED FOR THAT -- AND WE ARE

02:20:13.772 --> 02:20:15.039
WILLING TO RESPOND TO THAT.

02:20:15.106 --> 02:20:16.541
AND THIS WILL OF COURSE TAKE

02:20:16.608 --> 02:20:18.343
PLACE OVER THE COURSE OF THE

02:20:18.409 --> 02:20:19.577
NEXT YEAR.

02:20:19.644 --> 02:20:20.945
AND WE WILL HAVE TO BE VERY

02:20:21.012 --> 02:20:22.747
STRATEGIC ABOUT IT AND WANT TO

02:20:22.814 --> 02:20:24.182
MAKE SURE THAT NOT ONLY ARE WE

02:20:24.249 --> 02:20:26.384
PROVIDING GENERAL FAQS AND

02:20:26.451 --> 02:20:28.520
GUIDANCE AND TEMPLATES.

02:20:28.586 --> 02:20:30.121
BUT ALSO SOME TARGETED I'M

02:20:30.188 --> 02:20:32.457
TRAINING WHERE IT IS NEEDED

02:20:32.524 --> 02:20:35.160
WE'VE SEEN ANECDOTAL KLAY.

02:20:35.226 --> 02:20:36.261
THAT THERE'S A WIDE RANGE OF

02:20:36.327 --> 02:20:37.796
NEEDS THERE ARE SOME DISTRICTS

02:20:37.862 --> 02:20:39.831
THAT HAVE STRUCTURES IN PLACE --

02:20:39.898 --> 02:20:42.467
ABLE TO RESPOND TO COMPLAINTS

02:20:42.534 --> 02:20:44.235
AND INVESTIGATE THEM AND THERE

02:20:44.302 --> 02:20:45.537
ARE OTHER DISTRICTS THAT DON'T

02:20:45.603 --> 02:20:49.307
HAVE THOSE.

02:20:49.374 --> 02:20:51.409
TODAY SPOKE ABOUT THE NEED IN

02:20:51.476 --> 02:20:54.078
RURAL AREAS AND WE'VE SEEN THAT

02:20:54.145 --> 02:20:55.346
DISTRICTS ARE LAWYERS HAVE LESS

02:20:55.413 --> 02:20:57.849
RESOURCES SO WE'RE LOOKING AT

02:20:57.916 --> 02:21:00.318
ALL WAYS THAT WE CAN -- PROVIDE

02:21:00.385 --> 02:21:02.453
RESOURCES MAYBE CONNECT

02:21:02.520 --> 02:21:04.322
DISTRICTS THAT SOME HAVE

02:21:04.389 --> 02:21:06.024
RESOURCES AND OTHERS THAT DON'T

02:21:06.090 --> 02:21:07.025
TO THAT WE CAN ESTABLISH A

02:21:07.091 --> 02:21:09.994
COMMUNITY -- WE ALSO WANT TO

02:21:10.061 --> 02:21:12.063
DEVELOP PARTNERSHIPS NOT ONLY

02:21:12.130 --> 02:21:13.498
INTERNALLY WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT

02:21:13.565 --> 02:21:15.466
BUT EXTERNALLY AS WELL TO SEE

02:21:15.533 --> 02:21:16.734
WHAT EXISTING STRUCTURES ARE

02:21:16.801 --> 02:21:18.369
ALREADY OUT THERE IN TERMS OF

02:21:18.436 --> 02:21:20.405
TRAINING -- SO THAT WE DON'T

02:21:20.471 --> 02:21:21.873
HAVE TO REINVENT THE WHEEL OR

02:21:21.940 --> 02:21:23.141
OVER BURDENED DISTRICTS WHO WANT

02:21:23.208 --> 02:21:24.576
TO PROVIDE TRAINING AND

02:21:24.642 --> 02:21:26.744
RESOURCES TO THEM IN A WAY THAT

02:21:26.811 --> 02:21:27.612
MAKES SENSE.

02:21:27.679 --> 02:21:30.014
SO I WILL BE RESEARCHING NOT --

02:21:30.081 --> 02:21:31.349
AS SOON AS WE CAN DEVELOP OUR

02:21:31.416 --> 02:21:33.318
CENTRAL OFFICE AND OVER THE

02:21:33.384 --> 02:21:34.786
COURSE OF THE NEXT YEAR WE WOULD

02:21:34.853 --> 02:21:36.154
LIKE TO IMPLEMENT.

02:21:36.221 --> 02:21:39.157
AND HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE FOR THE

02:21:39.224 --> 02:21:41.192
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.

02:21:41.259 --> 02:21:42.627
AND I THINK THAT'S ALL I HAVE

02:21:42.694 --> 02:21:43.962
FOR MY PRESENTATION IF YOU HAVE

02:21:44.028 --> 02:21:45.597
ANY QUESTIONS WITH JUST A COUPLE

02:21:45.663 --> 02:21:48.666
OF THE COMPLAINT PROCESS IN.

02:21:48.733 --> 02:21:49.801
HOW IT WORKS OUR ANALYSIS

02:21:49.868 --> 02:21:51.569
INDICATED THAT?

02:21:51.636 --> 02:21:53.838
THERE WERE ABOUT -- FOUR SIXTY

02:21:53.905 --> 02:21:56.441
FIVE REQUESTED CD ACCEPTED ONE

02:21:56.507 --> 02:21:57.542
HUNDRED NINETY THREE APPEAL OR

02:21:57.609 --> 02:21:59.077
COMPLAINT REQUESTS.

02:21:59.143 --> 02:22:01.012
IN EIGHT UCP PROGRAMS DO YOU

02:22:01.079 --> 02:22:02.747
MAINTAIN STATISTICS ON WHY

02:22:02.814 --> 02:22:05.984
COMPLAINTS ARE NOT ACCEPTED IN.

02:22:06.050 --> 02:22:07.285
IN IN SOME DETAIL HER RIGHT SO

02:22:07.352 --> 02:22:09.220
WE WE ACTUALLY JUST SPOKE ABOUT

02:22:09.287 --> 02:22:11.289
THAT YESTERDAY SO WITH OUR NEW

02:22:11.356 --> 02:22:13.124
DATABASE IT'S RELATIVELY NEW WE

02:22:13.191 --> 02:22:16.294
ARE -- CONSTANTLY LOOKING AT HOW

02:22:16.361 --> 02:22:17.962
WE CAN BETTER COLLECT DATA.

02:22:18.029 --> 02:22:19.797
ON THIS IS A NEW VENTURE FOR US

02:22:19.864 --> 02:22:21.032
IF YOU WILL WE HAVE NOT

02:22:21.099 --> 02:22:22.734
COLLECTED IN AND REALLY ANALYZE

02:22:22.800 --> 02:22:24.135
THE DATA WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN IN

02:22:24.202 --> 02:22:25.603
THE BUSINESS OF PROCESSING

02:22:25.670 --> 02:22:28.072
APPEALS -- SO WE ARE LOOKING AT

02:22:28.139 --> 02:22:29.774
THAT AND IN LOOKING AT WAYS THAT

02:22:29.841 --> 02:22:32.877
WE CAN BETTER TEASE OUT OF THE

02:22:32.944 --> 02:22:34.078
YOU KNOW THE REASONS WHY WE'RE

02:22:34.145 --> 02:22:35.747
NOT ACCEPTING AND WHAT I CAN

02:22:35.813 --> 02:22:36.447
TELL YOU.

02:22:36.514 --> 02:22:39.884
IS THAT A LOT OF TIMES --

02:22:39.951 --> 02:22:41.519
COMPLAINTS MAY BE FRUSTRATED AND

02:22:41.586 --> 02:22:42.787
A DISTRICT LEVEL ONE SO THEY

02:22:42.854 --> 02:22:44.255
WANT TO COME DIRECTLY TO THE

02:22:44.322 --> 02:22:46.491
STATE TO FILE A COMPLAINT.

02:22:46.557 --> 02:22:48.693
AND WE DO -- ALLOWED DISTRICTS

02:22:48.760 --> 02:22:50.361
THE REGULATIONS REQUIRE US TO

02:22:50.428 --> 02:22:51.863
ALLOW DISTRICTS TO HAVE AN

02:22:51.930 --> 02:22:53.364
OPPORTUNITY TO RESOLVE THAT

02:22:53.431 --> 02:22:55.300
COMPLAINT LOCALLY DISTRICTS DO

02:22:55.366 --> 02:22:56.701
YOU HAVE TO HAVE POLICIES AND

02:22:56.768 --> 02:22:58.069
PROCEDURES IN PLACE FOR

02:22:58.136 --> 02:22:59.604
RESOLVING COMPLAINTS.

02:22:59.671 --> 02:23:01.806
SO WE DO REFER THOSE BACK TO THE

02:23:01.873 --> 02:23:03.474
DISTRICT WELL THE REASON I ASK

02:23:03.541 --> 02:23:05.710
IS IF 71% OF THE COMPLAINTS ARE

02:23:05.777 --> 02:23:08.947
IN THE EDUCATION EQUITY AREA OF

02:23:09.013 --> 02:23:10.748
HEELS RELATED DELEGATION SIBLING

02:23:10.815 --> 02:23:12.150
HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION

02:23:12.216 --> 02:23:14.352
RETALIATION OR INTIMIDATION.

02:23:14.419 --> 02:23:15.954
ON THE BASIS OF PROTECTED

02:23:16.020 --> 02:23:17.155
CHARACTERISTICS.

02:23:17.221 --> 02:23:22.860

COMMITTEE BECAUSE CHANCES OFFICE

02:34:13.644 --> 02:34:16.513
IS DONE A JUST AN OVERALL

02:34:16.580 --> 02:34:18.449
MANPOWER STUDY. TO DETERMINE

02:34:18.515 --> 02:34:21.251
WHETHER EXISTING STAFF OR YOUR

02:34:27.992 --> 02:34:30.127
I'VE SEEN THE BCP PROCESS AND

02:34:30.194 --> 02:34:31.362
THAT DOESNT.

02:34:31.428 --> 02:34:32.763
RISE TO THE LEVEL OF A MAN PAR

02:34:32.830 --> 02:34:34.865
STUDY.

02:34:34.932 --> 02:34:36.734
AS I UNDERSTAND IT YEAH.

02:34:36.800 --> 02:34:39.837
IT DOES NOT SO.

02:34:39.903 --> 02:34:41.005
SO WHEN CHANCELLOR OAKLEY CAME

02:34:41.071 --> 02:34:42.906
IN TWO YEARS AGO -- FOLLOWING

02:34:42.973 --> 02:34:45.709
HIS -- APPOINTMENT AS CHANCELLOR

02:34:45.776 --> 02:34:47.978
WE DID A REVIEW OF THE AGENCY

02:34:48.045 --> 02:34:51.615
REALLY FOCUSED ON FIGURING OUT

02:34:51.682 --> 02:34:54.952
HOW DO WE ADJUST OUR POSITIONS

02:34:55.019 --> 02:34:56.654
REALLOCATE OUR POSITIONS WITHIN

02:34:56.720 --> 02:34:58.889
THE EXISTING AUTHORITY SO -- YOU

02:34:58.956 --> 02:35:00.591
KNOW HE WAS ESPECIALLY INTENT IN

02:35:00.658 --> 02:35:01.425
MAKING SURE THAT WE WERE

02:35:01.492 --> 02:35:02.826
MANAGING THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE

02:35:02.893 --> 02:35:04.628
APPROPRIATELY -- THAT OUR

02:35:04.695 --> 02:35:05.996
POSITION AUTHORITY EXCEEDED THE

02:35:06.063 --> 02:35:10.834
ABILITY FOR US -- TO TO FUNDED

02:35:10.901 --> 02:35:11.969
GIVEN THE EXISTING STATE

02:35:12.036 --> 02:35:13.971
RESOURCE SAYS AND WINE TO MAKE

02:35:14.038 --> 02:35:15.072
SURE THAT GIVEN THOSE

02:35:15.139 --> 02:35:16.740
LIMITATIONS -- WE WERE

02:35:16.807 --> 02:35:18.976
ALLOCATING OUR POSITIONS ARE

02:35:19.043 --> 02:35:20.944
EXISTING POSITIONS TO THE AREAS

02:35:21.011 --> 02:35:21.745
OF THE OFFICE WHERE THEY WERE

02:35:21.812 --> 02:35:23.480
MOST CRITICAL NEED SO THIS WAS

02:35:23.547 --> 02:35:27.584
NOT A CERTAINLY A MANPOWER STUDY.

02:35:27.651 --> 02:35:28.519
AS I WOULD IMAGINE AND I THINK

02:35:28.585 --> 02:35:30.320
AS YOU WOULD IMAGINE IT BUT

02:35:30.387 --> 02:35:31.689
ESSENTIALLY TO SAY LET'S FREEZE

02:35:31.755 --> 02:35:32.990
THE HIRING WHERE WE CURRENTLY

02:35:33.057 --> 02:35:34.792
ARE FIGURE OUT HOW MANY

02:35:34.858 --> 02:35:35.893
VACANCIES WE HAVE.

02:35:35.959 --> 02:35:37.294
AND THEN FIGURE OUT WHICH WE CAN

02:35:37.361 --> 02:35:38.762
FIND IN WHERE WE SHOULD PUT

02:35:38.829 --> 02:35:40.264
THOSE MOST STRATEGICALLY SO

02:35:40.330 --> 02:35:41.365
THAT'S PROBABLY THE CLOSEST

02:35:41.432 --> 02:35:43.100
THING WE'VE GOTTEN TO THAT TYPE

02:35:43.167 --> 02:35:44.468
OF STUDY.

02:35:44.535 --> 02:35:45.335
WE'VE WORKED WITH THE DEPARTMENT

02:35:45.402 --> 02:35:47.571

02:35:47.638 --> 02:35:49.673
SIMILAR WORK TO TRY TO IDENTIFY

02:35:49.740 --> 02:35:49.973
OUR NEEDS.

02:35:50.040 --> 02:35:54.144
THIS RECALL YOUR FOLLOWS ON A AN

02:35:54.211 --> 02:35:55.879
INTENT TO PRIORITIZE WHAT WE CAN

02:35:55.946 --> 02:35:57.281
FUND -- WITH OUR STATE

02:35:57.347 --> 02:35:59.049
OPERATIONS DOLLARS BUT AGAIN I

02:35:59.116 --> 02:36:01.185
WOULD HIGHLIGHT THE THE POINT --

02:36:01.251 --> 02:36:02.553
KIND OF OUR SECOND PROPOSAL

02:36:02.619 --> 02:36:04.354

GOING TO THE INSTITUTIONAL

02:36:09.426 --> 02:36:09.893
EFFECTIVENESS PARTNERSHIP

02:36:09.960 --> 02:36:10.661
INITIATIVE.

02:36:10.728 --> 02:36:12.496
GOING TO BE SET ASIDE FROM

02:36:12.563 --> 02:36:14.364
CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS -- YOU KNOW

02:36:14.431 --> 02:36:15.766
THE CHANCELLOR BELIEVES THAT TO

02:36:15.833 --> 02:36:17.367
THE EXTENT WE COULD USE THOSE

02:36:17.434 --> 02:36:18.869
DOLLARS MORE STRATEGICALLY THAT

02:36:18.936 --> 02:36:21.405
WE COULD BEGIN TO RESOURCE THE

02:36:21.472 --> 02:36:22.806
STATE WIDE EFFORTS.

02:36:22.873 --> 02:36:24.041

02:37:00.911 --> 02:37:03.480
AND WHETHER YOU NEED TEN MORE

02:37:03.547 --> 02:37:06.617

02:37:06.683 --> 02:37:08.085
I CAME OUT OF THE MILITARY AND

02:37:08.152 --> 02:37:09.620
UNFORTUNATELY WE HAD THOSE WITH

02:37:09.686 --> 02:37:11.522

YOU YOU HAD?

02:37:18.729 --> 02:37:20.230
JOB THAT YOU WERE EXPECTED TO DO

02:37:20.297 --> 02:37:20.964
SO.

02:37:21.031 --> 02:37:22.065
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

02:37:22.132 --> 02:37:23.934
CRACK THIS NOT I UNDERSTAND IT'S

02:37:24.001 --> 02:37:25.769
NOT PROP NINETY EIGHT IT'S

02:37:25.836 --> 02:37:26.970
FUNDED OF THE GENERAL FUND.

02:37:27.037 --> 02:37:28.972
BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE YOUR

02:37:29.039 --> 02:37:32.509

02:37:37.514 --> 02:37:38.048
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT ANOTHER

02:37:38.115 --> 02:37:39.149
WAY TO DO IT.

02:37:39.216 --> 02:37:40.884
I I RECOGNIZE THESE KINDS OF

02:37:40.951 --> 02:37:42.452
STUDIES GENERALLY ARE RISKY BUT

02:37:42.519 --> 02:37:43.687
I THINK WE WOULD BE VERY

02:37:43.754 --> 02:37:45.889
SUPPORTIVE OF IT BECAUSE I THINK

02:37:45.956 --> 02:37:47.491

CURRENT PRACTICES WE ARE HAVING

02:37:51.195 --> 02:37:52.830
TO PRIORITIZE BETWEEN WHERE WE

02:37:52.896 --> 02:37:54.865
SPEND OUR YOU KNOW TIME AND

02:37:54.932 --> 02:37:56.333

PERSONAL DOLLARS TODAY THERE

02:38:03.874 --> 02:38:06.276
LIKELY OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT WE

02:38:06.343 --> 02:38:07.644
COULD BE DOING THAT -- WE HAVE

02:38:07.711 --> 02:38:08.846
DE EMPHASIZE BECAUSE THEY ARE

02:38:08.912 --> 02:38:10.547
LESS -- BECAUSE OF THE LIMITED

02:38:10.614 --> 02:38:12.216
RESOURCES AND THEY'RE LESS

02:38:12.282 --> 02:38:13.617
CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH THE VISION.

BECAUSE THE NEED FOR ACCURATE

02:53:17.186 --> 02:53:18.254
AND CURRENT INFORMATION IS

02:53:18.321 --> 02:53:20.056

02:53:36.239 --> 02:53:39.108
SERVICES MODEL DESIGNED BY CSU

02:53:39.175 --> 02:53:40.910
AND DSS WAS BASED ON OUR

02:53:40.977 --> 02:53:42.745
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE SEVEN

02:53:42.812 --> 02:53:45.081
MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION WOULD

02:53:45.148 --> 02:53:46.249
BE ONE TIME FUNDING.

02:53:46.315 --> 02:53:48.918
DSS IS NEGOTIATING TO YOUR

02:53:48.985 --> 02:53:50.153
CONTRACTS WITH PROVIDERS.

02:53:50.219 --> 02:53:51.487
AND BECAUSE OF LIMITED DURATION

02:53:51.554 --> 02:53:53.356
ARE PROVIDERS WON'T BE ABLE TO

02:53:53.422 --> 02:53:54.924
ASSIST INDIVIDUALS WITH MATTERS

02:53:54.991 --> 02:53:56.592
THAT ARE TOO COMPLICATED OR

02:53:56.659 --> 02:53:58.261
REQUIRE SRVICE THAT EXCEED THE

02:53:58.327 --> 02:54:00.229
CONTRACT PERIOD.

02:54:00.296 --> 02:54:01.364
ADDITIONAL FUNDING COULD EXPAND

02:54:01.430 --> 02:54:03.132
THE SCOPE OF THESE IMPORTANT

02:54:03.199 --> 02:54:04.233

THE FUNDING WHAT OULD WE

02:54:07.637 --> 02:54:08.838
BELIEVE THE COST OF LEGAL

02:54:08.905 --> 02:54:11.207
SERVICE EXCEEDS THE CURRENT

02:54:11.274 --> 02:54:12.909
ALLOCATION.

02:54:12.975 --> 02:54:14.243

GROWTH IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND

02:56:43.859 --> 02:56:45.695
WHY THIS IS CURRENTLY HOUSE BUT

02:56:58.574 --> 02:57:00.977
THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT HAS GROWN

02:57:01.043 --> 02:57:03.012
AT TWENTY FIVE FOLD OVER -- OVER

02:57:03.079 --> 02:57:04.447

MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM THAT

02:57:10.386 --> 02:57:12.154

02:57:23.699 --> 02:57:27.036
EXPANDED INTO -- HIGHER

02:57:27.103 --> 02:57:28.838
EDUCATION.

02:57:28.904 --> 02:57:30.573
FUNDING WAS AWARDED TO CDSS TO

02:57:30.639 --> 02:57:31.874
ADMINISTER BECAUSE OF THAT

02:57:31.941 --> 02:57:33.542
EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE WE ARE

02:57:33.609 --> 02:57:34.977
VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE

02:57:35.044 --> 02:57:36.012
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE

02:57:36.078 --> 02:57:37.346
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE BOTH IN

02:57:37.413 --> 02:57:38.681
COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND WITH THE

02:57:38.748 --> 02:57:40.149
CS USE.

02:57:40.216 --> 02:57:43.419
AND AS AN INITIAL ROLLOUT OF THE

02:57:43.486 --> 02:57:44.687
FUNDING WE HAD EXTENSIVE

02:57:44.754 --> 02:57:46.255
COMMUNICATION WITH THE UC SYSTEM

02:57:46.322 --> 02:57:47.990
BECAUSE WE ALSO FUND THEM FOR

02:57:48.057 --> 02:57:53.896
SOME OF THEIR LEGAL SERVICES --

02:57:53.963 --> 02:57:54.397
THIS.

02:57:54.463 --> 02:57:56.999
PROJECT IS UNFOLDING IN -- IN A

02:57:57.066 --> 02:57:57.633
AND THE CONTACTS THAT I WOULD

02:57:57.700 --> 02:58:00.703
SAY IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND

02:58:00.770 --> 02:58:03.439
I THINK. THREE THREE ELEMENTS

02:58:03.506 --> 02:58:05.474
ONE IS THAT THIS IS ABOUT

02:58:05.541 --> 02:58:07.176
SYSTEMS INTEGRATION ON THE ONE

02:58:07.243 --> 02:58:08.744
HAND YOU HAVE THE LEGAL SERVICES

02:58:08.811 --> 02:58:10.279
PROVIDER IS INTEGRATING THEIR

02:58:10.346 --> 02:58:12.148
SERVICES WITH TWO VERY DIFFERENT

02:58:12.214 --> 02:58:13.849
SYSTEMS THE CSU.

02:58:13.916 --> 02:58:15.551
AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

02:58:15.618 --> 02:58:16.619
IT'S ALSO HAPPENING IN THE

02:58:16.685 --> 02:58:18.621
CONTEXT OF GREAT EXPANSION FOR

02:58:18.687 --> 02:58:21.557
THE LEGAL SERVICES PROVIDERS AND

02:58:21.624 --> 02:58:24.493
IT IS A SERVICE WHICH REQUIRES

02:58:24.560 --> 02:58:25.828
HIGHLY TRAINED INDIVIDUALS

02:58:25.895 --> 02:58:27.563
MAINLY LAWYERS.

02:58:27.630 --> 02:58:29.632
IT IS NOT A IT IS NOT IT A TYPE

02:58:29.698 --> 02:58:31.367
OF SERVICE THAT IT'S EASY TO

02:58:31.434 --> 02:58:33.069
EXPAND QUICKLY IT REQUIRES YES

02:58:33.135 --> 02:58:35.538
MONEY BUT IT ALSO REQUIRES TIME.

02:58:35.604 --> 02:58:37.573
AND ON TOP OF THAT THIS IS BEING

02:58:37.640 --> 02:58:39.075
ROLLED OUT IN THE CONTEXT OF

02:58:39.141 --> 02:58:40.976
RAPIDLY CHANGING IN A VERY

02:58:41.043 --> 02:58:42.278
VOLATILE HEIL.

02:58:42.344 --> 02:58:44.547
OF FEDERAL IMMIGRATION LAW AND

02:58:44.613 --> 02:58:46.649
POLICY LANDSCAPE AND SO ALL OF

02:58:46.715 --> 02:58:47.383
THOSE FACTORS HAVE TO BE

02:58:47.450 --> 02:58:48.951
CONSIDERED IN THINKING ABOUT THE

02:58:49.018 --> 02:58:50.853
TIME LINE FOR THE ROLL OUT OF OF

02:58:50.920 --> 02:58:52.388
OF THIS PROJECT.

02:58:52.455 --> 02:58:56.559
THAT SAID -- WITH THAT WITH THE

02:58:56.625 --> 02:58:59.261
CS USE WE HAVE WE ARE IN IN IN

02:58:59.328 --> 02:59:01.163
IN THE FINAL CONVERSATIONS AND

02:59:01.230 --> 02:59:03.099
WILL BE M. X. ANY CONTRACTS TO

02:59:03.165 --> 02:59:05.601
ABOUT FIVE PROVIDERS FOR OVER

02:59:05.668 --> 02:59:06.368
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OFTHE

02:59:06.435 --> 02:59:07.236
SEVEN MILLION.

02:59:07.303 --> 02:59:08.838
DOLLARS THAT WERE ALLOCATED FOR

02:59:08.904 --> 02:59:11.507
THE CSU AND I WANT TO REITERATE

02:59:11.574 --> 02:59:13.342
SOMETHING THAT WAS SAID BY BY

02:59:13.409 --> 02:59:14.510
THE CSU.

02:59:14.577 --> 02:59:17.746
BY DESIGN -- WE HELD BACK SOME

02:59:17.813 --> 02:59:18.981
OF THE FUNDING BECAUSE IT WAS

02:59:19.048 --> 02:59:21.083
CONTEMPLATED THAT IT WAS ONE

02:59:21.150 --> 02:59:22.384
TIME FUNDING WHEN IT WAS FIRST

02:59:22.451 --> 02:59:23.686
APPROPRIATED.

02:59:23.752 --> 02:59:25.321
AND SO WE CUT IT AND THE LAST TO

02:59:25.387 --> 02:59:27.723
KNOW ONE TIME ONE YEAR

02:59:27.790 --> 02:59:29.892
IMMIGRATION PROGRAM WE WANTED TO

02:59:29.959 --> 02:59:30.826
BUILD OUT THE PROGRAM FOR

02:59:30.893 --> 02:59:33.562
MULTIPLE YEARS SO BY DESIGN WE

02:59:33.629 --> 02:59:34.196
DID HOME HEALTH.

02:59:34.263 --> 02:59:35.698
HOLD BACK SOME OF THE FUNDING OF

02:59:35.764 --> 02:59:36.966
COURSE OF THAT FUNDING BECOMES

02:59:37.032 --> 02:59:38.434
ON GOING IT CREATES AN

02:59:38.501 --> 02:59:40.469
OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE EXPANSIVE

02:59:40.536 --> 02:59:42.071
SERVICE ALSO TO EXPAND THAT.

02:59:42.138 --> 02:59:43.372

OF THOSE THIRTY FIVE NINETEEN

03:05:38.760 --> 03:05:40.362
HAVE STAFF THAT ARE DEDICATED.

03:05:40.429 --> 03:05:41.597
TO THAT PROJECT I'LL

03:05:41.663 --> 03:05:43.131

03:07:06.214 --> 03:07:08.483
THAT'S AN ACCURATE AND IN FACT

03:07:08.550 --> 03:07:12.087

SYSTEM OF THE SO THE STATUTE

03:07:15.390 --> 03:07:16.758
VERY EXPLICITLY DIRECTS OUR

03:07:16.825 --> 03:07:19.227

STATUTE LA'S CCD HAS CONTRACTED

03:07:24.733 --> 03:07:26.802
WITH DSS I THINK THE CONFUSION

03:07:26.868 --> 03:07:28.403
MIGHT BE AROUND.

03:07:28.470 --> 03:07:30.672
THE FACT THAT THE FOUNDATION HAS

03:07:30.739 --> 03:07:32.374
TAKEN THE LEAD ON BETTER

03:07:32.441 --> 03:07:34.476
UNDERSTANDING THESE ISSUES AND I

03:07:34.543 --> 03:07:36.311
THINK THAT IS REALLY -- MAYBE TO

YOUR POINT -- INDICATIVE OF

03:07:38.113 --> 03:07:40.716

03:07:52.461 --> 03:07:53.695
THE SYSTEM.

03:07:53.762 --> 03:07:54.830
AND SO WE'VE WORKED TO GENERATE

03:07:54.896 --> 03:07:56.264
PHILANTHROPIC DOLLARS ARE

03:07:56.331 --> 03:07:57.933
MECHANISM FOR COLLECTING

03:07:58.000 --> 03:07:58.967
PHILANTHROPIC DOLLARS THIS

03:07:59.034 --> 03:08:00.869

03:08:00.936 --> 03:08:02.304
THEY'VE REALLY -- BUILT UP THE

03:08:02.371 --> 03:08:03.672

AND PROVIDING THEM TO GOVERNMENT

03:08:12.714 --> 03:08:14.182
INSTITUTIONS SO THAT WE CAN

03:08:14.249 --> 03:08:15.717
IMPROVE OUR PROCESSES I WAS JUST

03:08:15.784 --> 03:08:16.918

EXTREMELY SERIOUS ONE AND THAT'S

03:08:25.260 --> 03:08:27.996

THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH BEING A

03:08:38.173 --> 03:08:40.575

IF IF I SHOULD KNOW THAT I DON'T.

03:08:53.088 --> 03:08:54.489
SURE SURE NO PROBLEM.

03:08:54.556 --> 03:08:56.158
SO GENERALLY ALL OF OUR

03:08:56.224 --> 03:08:58.126

03:08:58.193 --> 03:08:59.695
