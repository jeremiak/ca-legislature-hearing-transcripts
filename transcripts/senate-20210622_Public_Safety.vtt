00:39:20.558 --> 00:39:24.395
pWOULD THEY STILL HAVE TO TAKE

00:39:24.462 --> 00:39:26.097
THE TRAINING IF THEY DON'T KNOW

00:39:26.163 --> 00:39:26.530
THEY'RE GOING TO BE

00:39:26.597 --> 00:39:28.699
VOLUNTEERING FOR. WHAT IS IT

00:39:28.766 --> 00:39:29.734
THIRTY TWO HOURS YOU SAID OR

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:33.738
SIXTEEN HOURS. TOTAL FIXED. THE

00:39:33.804 --> 00:39:35.339
REQUIREMENT IS FOR REGULAR

00:39:35.406 --> 00:39:37.074
VOLUNTEER SO THE SITUATION THAT

00:39:37.141 --> 00:39:39.076
YOU'RE DESCRIBING EVEN BEFORE

00:39:39.143 --> 00:39:40.211
THE AMENDMENTS WOULD HAVE NEVER

00:39:40.277 --> 00:39:42.146
KICKED IN- THAT REQUIREMENT IT

00:39:42.213 --> 00:39:44.115
WOULD REQUIRE SIXTEEN HOURS IN

00:39:44.181 --> 00:39:46.817
A MONTH OR THIRTY TWO HOURS IN

00:39:46.884 --> 00:39:49.053
A YEAR. THOSE AREN'T ARM STEP

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:51.188
IN VOLUNTEERS. I WOULD SUGGEST

00:39:51.255 --> 00:39:52.523
THOUGH HOWEVER THAT WE SHOULD

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:54.058
REALLY THINK ABOUT THE FACT

00:39:54.125 --> 00:39:56.127
THAT AS A PARENT WHEN I'M

00:39:56.193 --> 00:39:56.927
SENDING MY CHILDREN TO AN

00:39:56.994 --> 00:39:59.396
ACTIVITY. I'M HOPEFUL THAT THE

00:39:59.463 --> 00:40:01.198
PEOPLE WHO ARE WATCHING MY

00:40:01.265 --> 00:40:02.767
CHILDREN ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN

00:40:02.833 --> 00:40:04.568
VETTED IN FACT I WAS SHOCKED TO

00:40:04.635 --> 00:40:06.570
FIND OUT HOW MANY SITUATIONS

00:40:06.637 --> 00:40:08.272
THAT WE LEAVE OUR CHILDREN.

00:40:08.339 --> 00:40:10.007
WITH INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVEN'T

00:40:10.074 --> 00:40:12.676
BEEN VETTED IN SO YOU KNOW I. I

00:40:12.743 --> 00:40:14.178
UNDERSTAND THE KIND OF AYE I'M

00:40:14.245 --> 00:40:16.313
RUNNING HALF AN HOUR LATE AND

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:18.382
ANOTHER PARENT STEPS IN- BUT

00:40:18.449 --> 00:40:19.750
QUITE FRANKLY I THINK IF WE

00:40:19.817 --> 00:40:21.786
WANT TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT

00:40:21.852 --> 00:40:23.187
STOPPING. CHILDHOOD SEXUAL

00:40:23.254 --> 00:40:24.889
ABUSE AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS

00:40:24.955 --> 00:40:25.856
TOWARDS OUR CHILDREN AND

00:40:25.923 --> 00:40:26.657
LEAVING THEM IN THE CARE OF

00:40:26.724 --> 00:40:27.758
PEOPLE WE KNOW AND TRUST THAT

00:40:27.825 --> 00:40:29.026
MAYBE WE SHOULD BE A LITTLE BIT

00:40:29.093 --> 00:40:31.295
MORE- STRINGENT ON WHO'S DOING

00:40:31.362 --> 00:40:32.129
THE SPONSORING. THAT THAT'S

00:40:32.196 --> 00:40:34.098
JUST. A PARENTS RIO AND THAT'S

00:40:34.165 --> 00:40:36.700
HOW I APPROACH THIS- AGAIN I

00:40:36.767 --> 00:40:38.135
WAS SHOCKED TO FIND A LOT OF

00:40:38.202 --> 00:40:39.470
THINGS OUT IN THIS BILL THAT

00:40:39.537 --> 00:40:41.272
OUR SUNDAY SCHOOL TEACHERS ARE

00:40:41.338 --> 00:40:43.808
YOU KNOW- THE FOLKS WHO ARE

00:40:43.874 --> 00:40:45.176
TAKING YOUR KIDS ON FIELD TRIPS

00:40:45.242 --> 00:40:46.844
UP FROM SCHOOL NONE OF THEM ARE

00:40:46.911 --> 00:40:49.046
VETTED- SO IF. IF SOMEBODY

00:40:49.113 --> 00:40:50.681
WANTS TO VOLUNTEER ON A REGULAR

00:40:50.748 --> 00:40:51.749
BASIS AND USUALLY IF YOU'RE

00:40:51.816 --> 00:40:53.517
GOING TO HAVE SOMEBODY WHO IS

00:40:53.584 --> 00:40:54.952
DOING SO BECAUSE THEY ARE

00:40:55.019 --> 00:40:56.854
ACTING AS A PREDATOR IN SOME

00:40:56.921 --> 00:40:58.289
WAY- IT'S USUALLY NOT THE

00:40:58.355 --> 00:41:00.057
PERSON WHO STEPS AND SO I THINK

00:41:00.124 --> 00:41:01.625
THE SIXTEEN HOUR KIND OF. TAKES

00:41:01.692 --> 00:41:02.793
CARE OF THAT SIXTEEN HOURS A

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:04.662
WEEK IS A LOT OF VOLUNTEER- IN

00:41:04.728 --> 00:41:06.497
A MONTH AND THIRTY TWO AND

00:41:06.564 --> 00:41:07.164
HERE'S A LOT OF VOLUNTEER

00:41:07.231 --> 00:41:10.534
HOURS. I AGREE M. MY USER I.

00:41:11.669 --> 00:41:12.937
OBJECTIVES THAT YOU'VE SET UP

00:41:13.003 --> 00:41:15.206
YOUR ON THIS BILL. AND I THINK

00:41:15.272 --> 00:41:17.141
WE'VE ALL HAVE ENOUGH EXAMPLES

00:41:17.208 --> 00:41:19.777
OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS NON

00:41:19.844 --> 00:41:22.413
MAINLY. MUCH LARGER THAT WE'VE

00:41:22.479 --> 00:41:24.081
ENTRUSTED AND HAVE HAD A

00:41:24.148 --> 00:41:26.016
REPUTATION THAT HAS. YOU KNOW

00:41:26.083 --> 00:41:28.252
FAR EXCEEDED. OUR EXPECTATIONS

00:41:28.319 --> 00:41:35.526
OF NARAL LEARNING- THE LOVE THE.

00:41:35.593 --> 00:41:36.927
DEGREE OF- CHILD ABUSE OF

00:41:36.994 --> 00:41:38.896
SIKKIM PLACE AND SOME OF THE-

00:41:38.963 --> 00:41:39.997
WHAT WE CONSIDER. ORGANIZATIONS

00:41:40.064 --> 00:41:42.166
I'M- AGREE WHERE YOU GO AND I.

00:41:42.233 --> 00:41:43.968
UNDERSTANDING YOU'RE- A MEMBER

00:41:44.034 --> 00:41:47.671
AND YOUR- OPPOSED TO MEN ARE. I

00:41:47.738 --> 00:41:49.340
THINK OKAY AND MOVING THIS BILL

00:41:49.406 --> 00:41:51.308
SO I GUESS WE'RE SEEKING A WELL

00:41:51.375 --> 00:41:55.012
WOULD YOU- WOULD YOU LIKE TO

00:41:55.079 --> 00:41:58.249
CLOSER. I'M AND I APPRECIATE IT

00:41:58.315 --> 00:42:01.051
CHAIRMAN- I APPRECIATE. HABEEN

00:42:01.118 --> 00:42:03.020
THIS OPPORTUNITY I DEAL WITH

00:42:03.087 --> 00:42:04.388
THE OPPOSITION I DO WANT TO

00:42:04.455 --> 00:42:05.656
SUGGEST THOUGH IT IS NOT GOOD

00:42:05.723 --> 00:42:07.591
ENOUGH TO SAY ARE MANDATORY

00:42:07.658 --> 00:42:09.660
REPORTERS SYSTEM IS BROKEN THE

00:42:09.727 --> 00:42:11.662
TRUTH IS I DON'T CARE IF IT'S

00:42:11.729 --> 00:42:13.664
10% OF KIDS THAT ARE FOUND ON

00:42:13.731 --> 00:42:14.531
THAT THEY'RE BEING ABUSED AND

00:42:14.598 --> 00:42:16.600
NEGLECTED. THAT IS AN IMPORTANT

00:42:16.667 --> 00:42:17.868
10% OF KIDS THAT WE NEED TO

00:42:17.935 --> 00:42:20.237
REACH AND SO IF THE PROBLEM IS

00:42:20.304 --> 00:42:21.639
WITH THE CHILD WELFARE SERVICES

00:42:21.705 --> 00:42:23.374
YES BY ALL MEANS LET'S HIRE

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:24.808
FIRST OF ALL I THINK A LOT OF

00:42:24.875 --> 00:42:25.709
IT IS WE JUST DON'T HAVE

00:42:25.776 --> 00:42:27.378
ENOUGH- WORKERS WHO ARE

00:42:27.444 --> 00:42:28.812
ACTUALLY INVESTIGATING THESE

00:42:28.879 --> 00:42:30.614
CLAIMS AND ALSO THE PERCENTAGES

00:42:30.681 --> 00:42:32.449
THAT THEY USE AS THE REASONING

00:42:32.516 --> 00:42:33.651
FOR WHY THIS ISN'T WORKING

00:42:33.717 --> 00:42:35.252
ISN'T ACCURATE WE ALL KNOW

00:42:35.319 --> 00:42:36.353
WE'VE ALL SEEN THE NETFLIX

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:37.721
SERIES RIGHT. UNFORTUNATELY

00:42:37.788 --> 00:42:39.657
SOMEBODY SENT OUT TO THREE FOUR

00:42:39.723 --> 00:42:41.158
TIMES BEFORE THE INVESTIGATION

00:42:41.225 --> 00:42:42.293
FIND SOMETHING AND A LOT OF

00:42:42.359 --> 00:42:44.028
TIMES THEY DON'T FIND OUT UNTIL

00:42:44.094 --> 00:42:45.996
THE CHILD HAS DIED SO. I THINK

00:42:46.063 --> 00:42:49.867
WE NEED TO BE VERY- AWARE THAT

00:42:49.934 --> 00:42:52.169
THAT YES MAYBE WE'RE HAVING

00:42:52.236 --> 00:42:53.671
SOME DISPARITIES IN THE WAY

00:42:53.737 --> 00:42:55.005
FAMILIES ARE TREATED THAT IS A

00:42:55.072 --> 00:42:57.308
PROBLEM IT YOU KNOW INHERENT

00:42:57.374 --> 00:42:59.576
BIAS IS A PROBLEM. BUT THE REAL

00:42:59.643 --> 00:43:01.211
PROBLEM IS CHILDREN WHO ARE

00:43:01.278 --> 00:43:03.180
ABUSED NEGLECTED AND SUFFER

00:43:03.247 --> 00:43:05.182
FROM I'M CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ABUSE

00:43:05.249 --> 00:43:06.317
THAT WE'RE NOT CATCHING AND

00:43:06.383 --> 00:43:07.318
WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE THE SYSTEM

00:43:07.384 --> 00:43:08.652
BETTER BY JUST SAYING WELL WE

00:43:08.719 --> 00:43:09.186
DON'T WANNA DO MANDATORY

00:43:09.253 --> 00:43:11.522

MANY OF THESE PEOPLE DO NOT

KNOW THAT THE CRIMES THEY WERE

00:58:44.487 --> 00:58:46.222
CONVICTED OF REPORTABLE CRIMES.

00:58:46.289 --> 00:58:47.824
CURRENT LAW ALREADY SAYS THAT

00:58:47.891 --> 00:58:49.225
IF SOMEONE IS ON AWARE OF THE

00:58:49.292 --> 00:58:50.293
ADVERSE IMMIGRATION

00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:52.195

00:58:52.262 --> 00:58:54.063
THAT CONVICTION COULD BE FOUND

00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:56.065

IT'S NOT AVAILABLE TO THOSE

00:59:13.416 --> 00:59:14.384
CONVICTED AFTER TRIAL. I'M OF

00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:16.319
THE PERSPECTIVE WE SHOULDN'T-PUNISH PEOPLE FOR PURSUING

00:59:16.386 --> 00:59:17.520
TRIALS AND TRYING TO PROVE

00:59:17.587 --> 00:59:18.888

CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO A

00:59:20.056 --> 00:59:22.058

00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:24.727
DEVASTATING FOR IMMIGRANT

BASED ON CONVICTIONS. THAT ARE

00:59:33.569 --> 00:59:35.638
LEGALLY INVALID. THIS BILL

00:59:35.705 --> 00:59:36.873
WOULD SIMPLY EXPAND THE CURRENT

00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:38.508

01:18:33.008 --> 01:18:34.943
THAT ALIGN WITH THAT PARTICULAR

01:18:35.010 --> 01:18:36.778
CASE ARE WE JUST TALKING ABOUT

01:18:36.845 --> 01:18:40.048
PROTECTIVE ORDERS THAT MAY HAVE

01:18:40.115 --> 01:18:44.152
BEEN- ISSUED. INDEPENDENT

01:18:44.219 --> 01:18:46.455
CORRECT OF THE OF THAT

01:18:46.521 --> 01:18:48.523
PARTICULAR CASE THE INTENT IS

01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:51.126
FOR- IN THAT PARTICULAR CASE

01:18:51.193 --> 01:18:53.328
BUT I DO HAVE OF LESLIE THAT

01:18:53.395 --> 01:18:55.564
CAN ANSWER OTHER QUESTIONS ITEM

01:18:55.630 --> 01:18:56.998
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WE'RE

01:18:57.065 --> 01:18:59.000
WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT IN THAT

01:18:59.067 --> 01:19:03.004
PARTICULAR CASE NOT TO- REMOVE

01:19:03.071 --> 01:19:05.006
THE EXPUNGEMENT OR EVEN NOT

01:19:05.073 --> 01:19:06.074
ADDRESS THE EXPAND OUR I'M

01:19:06.141 --> 01:19:07.509
SORRY THE PROTECTIVE ORDER

01:19:07.576 --> 01:19:09.611
DURING THE EXPUNGEMENT. AND

01:19:09.678 --> 01:19:10.679
CURRENTLY IT'S NOT ADDRESSED

01:19:10.745 --> 01:19:11.847
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:19:11.913 --> 01:19:15.484
FIX IT IS NOT EVEN A PART OF.

01:19:15.550 --> 01:19:16.551
THE CONVERSATION IF YOU WILL

01:19:16.618 --> 01:19:18.253
WHEN THE EXCITEMENT HAPPENS SO

01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:19.621
WE'RE TRYING TO BRING IT INTO

01:19:19.688 --> 01:19:22.023
THE INTO THE FOREFRONT SO THAT

01:19:22.090 --> 01:19:23.125
THE JUDGE HAS THE DISCRETION TO

01:19:23.191 --> 01:19:24.993
SAY. WE CAN EXPECT WE CAN

01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:26.695
TERMINATE THE PROTECTIVE ORDER

01:19:26.761 --> 01:19:28.930
OR- IF IT'S BEING CAPPED AT

01:19:28.997 --> 01:19:30.332
LEAST THE VICTIM KNOWS WHAT'S

01:19:30.398 --> 01:19:31.766
HAPPENING WITH THAT PROTECTIVE

01:19:31.833 --> 01:19:33.869
ORDER RIGHT NOW IT'S BASICALLY-

01:19:33.935 --> 01:19:35.937
IF THE EXPUNGEMENT HAPPENS SOME

01:19:36.004 --> 01:19:37.806
SOME FOLKS WILL SAY WELL THE

01:19:37.873 --> 01:19:39.975
PROTECTIVE ORDER- GOALS WITH

01:19:40.041 --> 01:19:42.978
THAT AND OTHERS. JUDGES SAY IT

01:19:43.044 --> 01:19:45.280
DOES NOT SO THERE'S NO CLEAR.

01:19:45.347 --> 01:19:50.519
DEFINITION OF WHEN IT DOES. GET

01:19:50.585 --> 01:19:51.086
REMOVED OR WHEN IT DOESN'T.

01:19:51.153 --> 01:19:51.786
OKAY SO BECAUSE MY

01:19:51.853 --> 01:19:53.288
UNDERSTANDING WITH THE BILL WAS

01:19:53.355 --> 01:20:00.762
THAT. EVEN IF THE ONCE THE-

01:20:00.829 --> 01:20:04.366
EXPUNGEMENT HAS HAPPENED THAT.

01:20:04.432 --> 01:20:06.835
THE UNEXPIRED PROTECTIVE ORDER

01:20:06.902 --> 01:20:09.471
STILL CONTINUES UNLESS THE

01:20:09.538 --> 01:20:11.540
COURT DECIDES TO MODIFY IT

01:20:11.606 --> 01:20:14.142
WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM. ONCE

01:20:14.209 --> 01:20:16.945
THE EXPUNGEMENT HAPPENS THE

01:20:17.012 --> 01:20:18.713
UNEXPIRED PROTECTIVE ORDER IS

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:20.182
STILL BROUGHT TO THE COURT FOR

01:20:20.248 --> 01:20:23.318
THEM TO MAKE A DECISION SO.

01:20:23.385 --> 01:20:25.020
IT'S I MEAN IT'S A DISTINCTION

01:20:25.086 --> 01:20:27.255
WITH A DIFFERENCE BECAUSE ON

01:20:27.322 --> 01:20:29.257
THE ONE HAND YOU'RE GIVING

01:20:29.324 --> 01:20:31.026
AUTHORITY TO THE JUDGE TO SAY

01:20:31.092 --> 01:20:32.294
TAKE ALL OF THIS INTO

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:34.062
CONSIDERATION. AND THEN ON THE

01:20:34.129 --> 01:20:36.698
OTHER HAND YEAR YOU'RE SAYING

01:20:36.765 --> 01:20:37.299
WILL EVERYTHING IS GOING TO

01:20:37.365 --> 01:20:39.701
CONTINUE ON LAST YOU

01:20:39.768 --> 01:20:41.603
SPECIFICALLY TAKE THIS INTO

01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:43.972
CONSIDERATION SO IS IT GOING

01:20:44.039 --> 01:20:45.507
THE FORMER FOR THE LATTER WELL.

01:20:45.574 --> 01:20:48.109
IF I CAN ASK CLOSELY TO OUR I'M

01:20:48.176 --> 01:20:52.147
SORRY. WHY OF. THIS LEAD TO

01:20:52.214 --> 01:20:53.148
RESPOND TO THAT PLEASE BECAUSE

01:20:53.215 --> 01:20:54.616
I THINK YOU KNOW AGAIN MY

01:20:54.683 --> 01:20:56.084
UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT GIVES

01:20:56.151 --> 01:20:57.285
THE JUDGE THE DISCRETION TO DO

01:20:57.352 --> 01:20:59.521
EITHER RIGHT TO SAY YES OR NO

01:20:59.588 --> 01:21:01.423
AND SOME JUDGES ARE CHOOSING

01:21:01.489 --> 01:21:02.557
ONE AND OTHERS ARE CHOOSING THE

01:21:02.624 --> 01:21:04.759
OTHER AND THAT'S THE REASON FOR

01:21:04.826 --> 01:21:07.095
THE- FOR THE BILL. BLACKLICK

01:21:07.162 --> 01:21:09.664
YES SOAK SO CURRENTLY IT THE

01:21:09.731 --> 01:21:11.032
WAY IT WORKS IS WHEN SOMEBODY

01:21:11.099 --> 01:21:12.667
MAKES THEM AN EXPUNGEMENT

01:21:12.734 --> 01:21:13.635
EMOTIONS THAT THE RECORD

01:21:13.702 --> 01:21:16.104
EXPUNGED. IT'S LITERALLY UP TO

01:21:16.171 --> 01:21:17.772
THE JUDGE AND TO WHOEVER'S

01:21:17.839 --> 01:21:18.673
MAKING THE MOTION ON WHETHER

01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:19.674
THEY WANT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE

01:21:19.741 --> 01:21:20.775
OF THE PROTECTIVE ORDER IF

01:21:20.842 --> 01:21:23.378
THERE'S ONE AND QUITE. A LOT WE

01:21:23.445 --> 01:21:24.145
ARE PROPOSING IT WOULD MAKE IT

01:21:24.212 --> 01:21:26.114
SO THAT. AT THE TIME THAT THE

01:21:26.181 --> 01:21:29.584
MOTION TO EXPUNGE IT MADE. THE

01:21:29.651 --> 01:21:31.720
PERSON MAKING IT CAN. BRING UP

01:21:31.786 --> 01:21:32.821
THE ISSUE OF THE PROTECTIVE

01:21:32.887 --> 01:21:34.689
ORDER. AND ASK THE COURT TO

01:21:34.756 --> 01:21:36.758
MODIFY OR TERMINATE. BUT IF IT

01:21:36.825 --> 01:21:38.426
DOES NOT ADDRESS- BROUGHT UP BY

01:21:38.493 --> 01:21:39.661
THE PERSON WHO IS MAKING THE

01:21:39.728 --> 01:21:40.962
MOTION ON BEHALF OF THE

01:21:41.029 --> 01:21:42.597
DEFENDANT. AND THE PRESUMPTION

01:21:42.664 --> 01:21:43.665
WOULD BE THAT THE PROTECTIVE

01:21:43.732 --> 01:21:45.767
ORDER WOULD REMAIN IN FULL

01:21:45.834 --> 01:21:48.737
FORCE AND EFFECT. I'M NOT AND

01:21:48.803 --> 01:21:50.605
UNTIL SOMEBODY BRINGS THAT.

01:21:50.672 --> 01:21:52.607
PROTECTIVE ORDER TO THE COURT

01:21:52.674 --> 01:21:53.775
AND THE COURT HEARS WHATEVER

01:21:53.842 --> 01:21:55.076
EVIDENCE STATE HAS BROUGHT

01:21:55.143 --> 01:21:56.144
FORWARD TO MAKE THE

01:21:56.211 --> 01:21:57.345
DETERMINATION OF WHETHER IT IS

01:21:57.412 --> 01:21:59.314
APPROPRIATE OR NOT APPROPRIATE

01:21:59.381 --> 01:22:01.349
TO TERMINATE. EFFECTIVE ORDER.

01:22:01.416 --> 01:22:03.118
ITS WAY THE DEFENDANT IS ON

NOTICE- WHEN YOU MAKE THE

01:22:05.754 --> 01:22:07.522
MOTION TO EXPUNGE THAT THE

01:22:07.589 --> 01:22:08.890
PROTECTIVE ORDER WILL REMAIN IN

01:22:08.957 --> 01:22:10.425
FULL FORCE AND EFFECT. THE SAME

01:22:10.492 --> 01:22:12.394

BE PROTECTED. AGAIN I'M LOCKED

01:22:23.872 --> 01:22:25.707
INTEL. EVIDENTLY BROUGHT

01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:29.044
FORWARD THAT JUSTIFIED THE

01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:29.644
ELIMINATION OF THE PROTECTIVE

01:22:29.711 --> 01:22:33.281
ORDER. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT

01:22:33.348 --> 01:22:37.118
CONFUSED ME BECAUSE- IT IT

01:22:37.185 --> 01:22:38.586
SOUNDED LIKE YOU WERE SAYING IN

01:22:38.653 --> 01:22:40.588
THE BEGINNING THE IT WAS A LONG

01:22:40.655 --> 01:22:42.023
SENTENCE BUT IT SOUNDED LIKE

01:22:42.090 --> 01:22:43.525
THE FIRST PART OF THE SENTENCE

01:22:43.591 --> 01:22:45.527
SAID THAT AT THE TIME THAT THE

01:22:45.593 --> 01:22:48.063
EXPUNGEMENT IS HAPPENING THAT

01:22:48.129 --> 01:22:50.365
DEFENDANT'S COUNSEL. CAN THEN

01:22:50.432 --> 01:22:52.934
ALSO BRING UP THE ISSUE OF THE

01:22:53.001 --> 01:22:54.669
UNEXPIRED PROTECTIVE ORDER TO

01:22:54.736 --> 01:22:56.638
ASK THAT IT BE MODIFIED BUT

01:22:56.705 --> 01:22:57.572
THEN IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE

01:22:57.639 --> 01:22:58.840
SECOND PART OF WHAT YOU SAID

01:22:58.907 --> 01:23:00.809
SAID THAT AT THE TIME OF THE

01:23:00.875 --> 01:23:02.010
EXPUNGEMENT THE UNEXPIRED

01:23:02.077 --> 01:23:03.912
PROTECTIVE ORDER WOULD STILL BE%

01:23:03.978 --> 01:23:05.847
IN A FACT UNLESS AND UNTIL

01:23:05.914 --> 01:23:07.182
SOMEONE BROUGHT ADDITIONAL

01:23:07.248 --> 01:23:08.983
EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THAT

01:23:09.050 --> 01:23:10.552
UNEXPIRED PROTECTIVE ORDER

01:23:10.618 --> 01:23:13.588
COULD THEN. BE EXPIRED SO. ARE

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:17.325
THOSE AT THE SO ABILITY. LET

01:23:17.392 --> 01:23:18.960
THAT MAYBE I CAN TRY TO EXPLAIN

01:23:19.027 --> 01:23:22.530
IT WHEN THAT MOTION IS MADE

01:23:22.597 --> 01:23:23.131
UNDER THE AS WE ARE PROPOSING

01:23:23.198 --> 01:23:25.767
IT. IF NOBODY DISCUSSES IT

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:27.469
NOBODY BRINGS UP THE ISSUE OF

01:23:27.535 --> 01:23:28.603
THE PROTECTIVE ORDER AT THE

01:23:28.670 --> 01:23:30.472
TIME THE EXPUNGEMENT MADE. THIS

01:23:30.538 --> 01:23:33.575
LOT WOULD KEEP THE PROTECTIVE

01:23:33.641 --> 01:23:35.377
ORDER PRESUMPTIVELY IN PLACE.

01:23:35.443 --> 01:23:36.511
THAT DOESN'T PRECLUDE SOMEBODY

01:23:36.578 --> 01:23:38.179
FROM BRINGING UP THE PROTECTIVE

01:23:38.246 --> 01:23:39.848
ORDER AND ASKING THAT IT BE

01:23:39.914 --> 01:23:41.850
MODIFIED OR TERMINATED AT THE

01:23:41.916 --> 01:23:46.087
SAME TIME AS- THE EXPUNGEMENT.

01:23:46.154 --> 01:23:48.556
BUT AS WE ARE PROPOSING IT. IT

01:23:48.623 --> 01:23:50.992
WOULD KEEP THE PROTECTIVE ORDER

01:23:51.059 --> 01:23:54.129
IN PLACE. AT THE TIME THAT THE

01:23:54.195 --> 01:23:56.131
CONFINEMENT PRESUMPTIVELY AND

01:23:56.197 --> 01:23:58.133
LAST SOMEBODY AFFIRMATIVELY ASK

01:23:58.199 --> 01:23:59.601
THE COURT OR THE COURT ON ITS

01:23:59.667 --> 01:24:01.269
OWN MOTION DECIDES THAT IT

01:24:01.336 --> 01:24:02.704
WANTS YOUR BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE

01:24:02.771 --> 01:24:04.806
TERMINATED BUT THAT ANSWER YOUR

01:24:04.873 --> 01:24:07.275
QUESTION. YES IT DOES IT BUT IT

01:24:07.342 --> 01:24:08.343
BRINGS ME BACK TO I GUESS MY

01:24:08.410 --> 01:24:10.311
ORIGINAL QUESTION WHICH WAS

01:24:10.378 --> 01:24:11.579
WHETHER OR NOT THE PROTECTIVE

01:24:11.646 --> 01:24:12.714
ORDER ALIGNED WITH THE

01:24:12.781 --> 01:24:14.883
PARTICULAR CASE AND SO IF A

01:24:14.949 --> 01:24:17.018
CASE HAS BEEN EXPUNGED IN THE

01:24:17.085 --> 01:24:18.787
PRESUMPTION OR ASSUMPTION S

01:24:18.853 --> 01:24:21.856
THAT- IF YOU FIND. THERE'S NO

01:24:21.923 --> 01:24:22.891
MORE DERELICTION WITH THE

01:24:22.957 --> 01:24:24.225
PARTICULAR DEFENDANT BECAUSE OF

01:24:24.292 --> 01:24:25.493
THAT PARTICULAR CASE AND WHY

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:27.162
WOULD YOU HAVE A PROTECTIVE

01:24:27.228 --> 01:24:30.899
ORDER IN PLACE- FOR A CASE THAT

01:24:30.965 --> 01:24:32.667
HAS BEEN- DISMISSED OR

01:24:32.734 --> 01:24:34.869
EXPUNGED. BUT I THAT'S NOT YOU

01:24:34.936 --> 01:24:38.673
KNOW ABOUT. YOU DON'T ADDRESS

01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:40.475
THAT OR WOULD YOU LIKE DOWNTURN

01:24:40.542 --> 01:24:46.948
YEAH. D. D. EXPUNGEMENT. ABOUT

01:24:47.015 --> 01:24:52.053
LAWS. OUR THE WAY THEY WORK IS

01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:54.622
THAT IF SOMEBODY HAS HAS- MET

01:24:54.689 --> 01:24:57.225
THE STANDARDS FOR COMPLETING

01:24:57.292 --> 01:25:01.796
THEIR PROBATION. EIGHT THE CASE

01:25:01.863 --> 01:25:03.631
AUTOMATICALLY IS ENTITLED TO BE

01:25:03.698 --> 01:25:05.767
EXPUNGED IT DOESN'T ADDRESS THE

01:25:05.834 --> 01:25:07.302
ISSUE OF THE VICTIM BEING

01:25:07.368 --> 01:25:09.204
PROTECTED SO WHILE THERE THEY

01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:10.638
MAY HAVE MET ALL THE GUIDELINES

01:25:10.705 --> 01:25:12.707
AND STANDARDS THAT THEY NEEDED

01:25:12.774 --> 01:25:13.942
TO FOR PROBATION IT DOESN'T

01:25:14.008 --> 01:25:15.376
NECESSARILY ADDRESS THE

01:25:15.443 --> 01:25:17.412
PROTECTION OF THE VICTIM NOT

01:25:17.479 --> 01:25:20.248
EVERYTHING OKAY GET A TENURE

01:25:20.315 --> 01:25:23.585
PROTECTIVE ORDER. SO IT REALLY

01:25:23.651 --> 01:25:24.919
THE TENURE PROTECTIVE ORDERS GO

01:25:24.986 --> 01:25:26.354
WITH THE MOST SERIOUS MOLD MOST

01:25:26.421 --> 01:25:27.989
VIOLENT CASES THAT ADDS A LOT

01:25:28.056 --> 01:25:30.859
THAT CHANGE WHEN T COMES TO-

01:25:30.925 --> 01:25:31.693
PROTECTIVE JIMMY TO

01:25:31.759 --> 01:25:33.661
EXPUNGEMENT. IT MADE IT EASIER

01:25:33.728 --> 01:25:35.797
TO GET A CASE EXPUNGED BUT WE

01:25:35.864 --> 01:25:37.198
HAVEN'T ADDRESSED THE ISSUE-

01:25:37.265 --> 01:25:38.600
THE PROTECTIVE ORDERS AND WHAT

01:25:38.666 --> 01:25:40.101
SHOULD HAPPEN TO THEM AT THE

01:25:40.168 --> 01:25:41.870
TIME OF THE EXPUNGEMENT. SO

01:25:41.936 --> 01:25:43.271
THERE'S INCONSISTENCIES IN THE

01:25:43.338 --> 01:25:44.839
WAY THE LAWS HAVE DEVELOPED BUT

01:25:44.906 --> 01:25:46.708
A LOT THAT HAS REALLY ADDRESSED

IT WHY WOULDN'T I US AT THE

TIME IT DEPENDS ON THE ATTORNEY

01:31:15.336 --> 01:31:16.204
SOMETIMES BUT YOU KNOW

01:31:16.270 --> 01:31:17.972
ATTORNEYS YOU KNOW YOU HAD SOME

01:31:18.039 --> 01:31:19.574
FOLKS HAVE BETTER ATTORNEYS AND

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:22.143
OTHER IN MY OPINION AND IF I AN

01:31:22.210 --> 01:31:23.044
ATTORNEY'S JUST IN AND OUT

01:31:23.110 --> 01:31:25.379
TRYING TO JUST FINISH THIS AND

DOESN'T PAY ATTENTION TO THAT

01:31:26.747 --> 01:31:27.582
AND WE ALL KNOW THAT THAT

01:31:27.648 --> 01:31:33.588
HAPPENS THEN THOSE. FOLKS DON'T.

01:31:33.654 --> 01:31:34.155
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE

01:31:34.222 --> 01:31:37.425
THAT DISCUSSION- ANY. DECISION

01:31:37.491 --> 01:31:39.493
COME ON BUT THIS REQUIRE THE

01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:42.663
JUDGE TO DECLARE THAT AS

01:31:42.730 --> 01:31:45.600
SOMETHING FOR THE DEFENSE TO

01:31:45.666 --> 01:31:49.070
RAISE UP. SO THE ONUS IS ON ON

01:31:49.136 --> 01:31:52.540
THE COURT. I MEAN IF IT IF YOU

01:31:52.607 --> 01:31:53.908
DIDN'T DO ANYTHING THIS WOULD

01:31:53.975 --> 01:31:57.245
STILL BE IN PLACE AND THAT THE

01:31:57.311 --> 01:31:59.347
COUNCIL WOULD STILL HAVE TO.

01:31:59.413 --> 01:32:02.650
ASK FOR CONSIDERATION FOR THE

01:32:02.717 --> 01:32:04.218
PROTECTIVE ORDER TO BE

01:32:04.285 --> 01:32:07.288
CONSIDERED THIS DOESN'T DECLARE

01:32:07.355 --> 01:32:08.923
THAT IN THE EVENT OF AN

01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:10.925
EXPUNGEMENT THAT THE COURT THEN

01:32:10.992 --> 01:32:13.227
NOTIFIES THE COUNCIL THAT THAT

01:32:13.294 --> 01:32:15.396
IS SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN DO I

01:32:15.463 --> 01:32:16.063
MEAN I THINK THAT WOULD BE MORE

01:32:16.130 --> 01:32:18.566
HELPFUL THAN SORT OF CONTINUING

01:32:18.633 --> 01:32:20.735
WITH AN ASSUMPTION. THAT

01:32:20.801 --> 01:32:25.273
COUNCIL HAS TO. MAKE THIS ASK.

01:32:25.339 --> 01:32:30.344
BUT MAYBE I'M I MEAN ARE NOT. I

01:32:30.411 --> 01:32:31.712
AGREE BECAUSE I'M I MEAN I

01:32:31.779 --> 01:32:33.981
WOULDN'T SEE WHY COUNCIL

01:32:34.048 --> 01:32:34.615
WOULDN'T IF YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A

01:32:34.682 --> 01:32:36.217
CLIENT THAT HAS. RETURNED TO

01:32:36.284 --> 01:32:37.952
WORK ON IT WHY WOULD YOU ASK

01:32:38.019 --> 01:32:39.320

01:32:39.387 --> 01:32:40.755
YOU'RE DOING. THAT'S PART OF

01:32:40.821 --> 01:32:42.490
THE PROCEDURE OF. CLEARING THIS

01:32:42.556 --> 01:32:43.491
PERSON RIGHT OR WHY WOULD YOU

01:32:43.557 --> 01:32:45.993
ASK FOR THAT THAT'S PART I'M

01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:48.329
KIND OF LOS. THANK YOU BYE. YOU

COMPUTER SYSTEM OR IT'S THE

01:44:51.818 --> 01:44:53.420
LATTER PART OF PROTECTING THE

01:44:53.487 --> 01:44:54.388
INDIVIDUAL FROM RISK OF

01:44:54.454 --> 01:44:56.690
IDENTITY THEFT WITH THE FRAUD I

01:44:56.757 --> 01:44:58.258

THE WORDS IDENTITY THEFT OR

01:45:05.365 --> 01:45:07.501
FRAUD I THINK COULD BE NARAL

01:45:07.567 --> 01:45:09.970

I'M OKAY WITH YOU KNOW THE ON

01:45:11.638 --> 01:45:13.407
THE FIRST PART OF THE SENTENCE

01:45:13.473 --> 01:45:14.441
BUT THE STOP TO LET YOU KNOW

01:45:14.508 --> 01:45:16.410
THE- SECOND PART OF IT I THINK

01:45:16.476 --> 01:45:18.445
WE CAN KIND OF. FINE TUNE A

01:45:18.512 --> 01:45:21.248
LITTLE BIT I THINK SO TELL ME

WHAT THE ISSUES ARE FROM YOUR

01:45:23.784 --> 01:45:28.388
POINT OF VIEW OF WHY. WE

01:45:28.455 --> 01:45:29.823

INDIVIDUAL FROM RISK IDENTITY

01:45:31.558 --> 01:45:33.427
THEFT OR FRAUD. IN OTHER WORDS

01:45:33.493 --> 01:45:34.995
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT THAT'S

01:45:35.062 --> 01:45:36.596
PERHAPS TOO BROAD I THINK I

01:45:36.663 --> 01:45:37.898
THINK THE FOR THE WAR FRAUD

01:45:37.964 --> 01:45:40.167
ITSELF OR IDENTITY THEFT. COULD

01:45:40.233 --> 01:45:42.002
BE CONSTRUED. ARE A LITTLE BIT

01:45:42.069 --> 01:45:46.306
TOO BROADLY- I THINK. IT MAY BE

01:45:46.373 --> 01:45:48.308
BROADER THAN THE SCENARIO THAT

01:45:48.375 --> 01:45:50.310
THEY ARE ENCOUNTERING WHICH IS

01:45:50.377 --> 01:45:52.646

INFORMATION TO THEIR CLIENTS

01:46:05.926 --> 01:46:08.428
WHICH IS A TOTALLY LEGITIMATE.

01:46:08.495 --> 01:46:10.964
OPERATIONAL ROCEDURE. WHICH

01:46:11.031 --> 01:46:14.534
COULD BE NARROWER THAN YOU KNOW

01:46:14.601 --> 01:46:16.069
THE IDENTITY THEFT OR FRAUD. SO

01:46:16.136 --> 01:46:17.137
I'M HOPING TO EAT YOU KNOW THE

01:46:17.204 --> 01:46:17.971
COULD USE A DIFFERENT

01:46:18.038 --> 01:46:19.940
TERMINOLOGY. TO DESCRIBE THE

01:46:20.006 --> 01:46:22.175

PARTICULAR SET OF AMENDMENTS TO

01:48:06.413 --> 01:48:08.315
ADDRESS A PARTICULAR SITUATION

01:48:08.381 --> 01:48:10.650
THAT THE- HEALTH. WHICH IS THE

01:48:10.717 --> 01:48:12.319

SENTENCE HERE TO ADDRESS THAT

01:48:31.838 --> 01:48:33.073
PARTICULAR SITUATION WHICH I

THINK THE UNDERSTAND WHAT IS

01:48:34.774 --> 01:48:36.243
YOUR OBJECTION TO THAT I THINK

01:48:36.309 --> 01:48:38.545
THAT'S COMMONSENSE. A REQUEST

01:48:38.612 --> 01:48:39.946
THERE I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE

01:48:40.013 --> 01:48:42.449
OUT WHAT YOUR OBJECTION TO THAT

01:48:42.515 --> 01:48:45.785
YEAH WHAT THE OBJECTION IS. THE

01:48:45.852 --> 01:48:47.287
THREE WORDS COULD BE CONSTRUED

01:48:47.354 --> 01:48:48.388
MORE BROADLY THAN THAT

01:48:48.455 --> 01:48:49.556
PARTICULAR SITUATION THAT WAS

01:48:49.623 --> 01:48:50.991
MY CONCERN SO I'M TRYING TO

01:48:51.057 --> 01:48:52.125
THINK OF A WORD OF WORDS THAT

01:48:52.192 --> 01:48:54.327
WOULD. EVEN NARROWER IS A

01:48:54.394 --> 01:48:55.762
LITTLE NARROW SO THAT IT COULD

01:48:55.829 --> 01:48:57.831
COVER DESPERATE SITUATION AND

01:48:57.898 --> 01:48:59.900
NOT TRY TO CREATE AN EXCEPTION

01:48:59.966 --> 01:49:01.067
THAT'S BROUGHT YOU KNOW TO

01:49:01.134 --> 01:49:02.636
BROUGHT TO BASICALLY EAT UP THE

01:49:02.702 --> 01:49:04.104
RULE. SO THAT'S THAT'S THE

01:49:04.170 --> 01:49:05.906
THAT'S THE CONCERN I MEAN. I

01:49:05.972 --> 01:49:07.908
DEFINITELY DON'T WANT TO DO THE

01:49:07.974 --> 01:49:10.110
LAW TO BE. TWO BROAD NUMBER ONE

01:49:10.176 --> 01:49:10.977
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I WON A

01:49:11.044 --> 01:49:12.979
COMEDY PEOPLE WHO WANT TO

01:49:13.046 --> 01:49:14.281
ILLEGITIMATE THINGS SO THAT'S

01:49:14.347 --> 01:49:15.482
THE DEAL GOT TO FIND FIVE

01:49:15.548 --> 01:49:16.383
DOLLARS I'M TRYING TO CREATE

01:49:16.449 --> 01:49:19.219
HERE. BUT IF WE CANNOT COME UP

01:49:19.286 --> 01:49:20.754
WITH THE BETTER TERMINOLOGY

01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:21.888
BETWEEN NOW AND APPROACH I

01:49:21.955 --> 01:49:23.990
THINK YOU KNOW ALL- YOU'RE

01:49:24.057 --> 01:49:26.159
GOING TO APPROACH. I'M SORRY I

01:49:26.226 --> 01:49:27.360
TO FLOOR WE STILL HAVE TO

01:49:27.427 --> 01:49:28.662
ACTUALLY TO AMENDMENTS TO MAKE

01:49:28.728 --> 01:49:30.630
AND THAT IS TO CREATE A REMEDY

ADDRESSING THE ANALYSIS THE

01:51:34.988 --> 01:51:38.258
OTHER IS TO ALLOW THE COURT TO-

01:51:38.324 --> 01:51:39.092

I THINK THAT'S THE INTENT I

01:51:52.005 --> 01:51:55.775
MEAN I. DON'T WANT TO CREATE

01:51:55.842 --> 01:52:00.313
NEW CRIME IF I COULD AVOID IT-

01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:01.748
ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL

01:52:01.815 --> 01:52:04.117
QUESTIONS YEAH COMMITTEE I WANT

01:52:04.184 --> 01:52:06.719
TO CLARIFY THAT I ONLY WANT TO

THERE WERE AMENDMENTS OUTSIDE

01:52:11.424 --> 01:52:14.761
OF WHAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED. I'M

01:52:14.828 --> 01:52:15.695
NOT SURE WHERE THOSE WOULD

01:52:15.762 --> 01:52:17.697

WHETHER. WE SHOULD HOLD FOR A

01:52:24.971 --> 01:52:27.173
WEEK IN ORDER TO LAND SO THAT

LANGUAGE BECAUSE FOR ME IT'S

01:53:52.926 --> 01:53:56.129
HARD TO ENVISION. THAT CHANGE

01:53:56.196 --> 01:53:58.898
CALCULATIONS WHEN WE'RE MAKING

01:53:58.965 --> 01:54:00.867
THESE KINDS OF AMENDMENT

01:54:00.934 --> 01:54:03.369
RECOMMENDATIONS YOU KNOW ON THE

I WOULD BE OKAY WITH THAT

BECAUSE AS WE'VE BEEN

01:54:11.311 --> 01:54:13.179
DISCUSSING IT AND ACTUALLY

01:54:13.246 --> 01:54:15.215
BECOMES MORE CONFUSING TO ME. I

01:54:15.281 --> 01:54:17.250
MEAN MY UNDER I ALWAYS THOUGHT

01:54:17.317 --> 01:54:20.119
THAT IT WAS. ILLEGAL TO DO ALL

01:54:20.186 --> 01:54:21.788
OF THESE THINGS ANYWAY TO SELL

01:54:21.854 --> 01:54:23.556
DATA I MEAN IT'S ILLEGAL TO

01:54:23.623 --> 01:54:25.158
HAPPEN TO SOMEONE SYSTEM INTO

01:54:25.225 --> 01:54:27.627
LEGAL TO SELL SOMEONE FOR PRIDE

01:54:27.694 --> 01:54:31.064
JERRY INFORMATION. YEAH IT IS

01:54:31.130 --> 01:54:32.999
UNDER THE LAW UNDER THIS BILL

01:54:33.066 --> 01:54:33.566
WHICH STRUCTURE TRYING TO

01:54:33.633 --> 01:54:35.802
CREATE SOME OF THOSE

01:54:35.868 --> 01:54:37.503
EXCEPTIONS- I GUESS FROM TO

01:54:37.570 --> 01:54:40.006
ACCOMMODATE LAWFUL ACTIVITIES-

01:54:40.073 --> 01:54:41.674

01:54:41.741 --> 01:54:43.343
BROUGHT UP BY THE CHAMBER SO

01:54:43.409 --> 01:54:45.912
YEAH IT IS IT SHOULD BE ILLEGAL

01:54:45.979 --> 01:54:48.214
AND TO SELL AND TO BUY DATA

01:54:48.281 --> 01:54:49.415
THAT'S BEEN HACKED WE'RE

01:54:49.482 --> 01:54:50.717
LOOKING ACTUALLY AT THE- THE

01:54:50.783 --> 01:54:52.418
THIRD PARTY PEOPLE THESE ARE

01:54:52.485 --> 01:54:54.554
THE DOWNSTREAM PEOPLE WHO WANT

01:54:54.621 --> 01:54:56.022

01:54:56.089 --> 01:54:57.257
DATE YOU KNOW THAT'S BEEN

01:54:57.323 --> 01:54:58.958
HACKED AND SOLD. SO IT IS A

01:54:59.025 --> 01:55:00.260
MARKET PLACE OUT THERE THAT WE

01:55:00.326 --> 01:55:04.664

ALL HAVE JUST BECOME. YOU KNOW

01:55:10.303 --> 01:55:12.739
BITS OF DATA AND CODES AND

01:55:12.805 --> 01:55:15.475
INFORMATION. AND THERE ARE

01:55:15.541 --> 01:55:18.278
EITHER ALGORITHMS OR COMPANIES

01:55:18.344 --> 01:55:21.981
THAT ARE. TAKING OUR DATA THAT

01:55:22.048 --> 01:55:23.650
WE'RE FREELY GIVING EVERY TIME

01:55:23.716 --> 01:55:25.551
WE CLICK A BUTTON OR MAKE A

01:55:25.618 --> 01:55:28.855
PURCHASE SIX CETERA. I DON'T

01:55:28.921 --> 01:55:30.857
NECESSARILY KNOW WHO OWNS THAT

01:55:30.923 --> 01:55:32.191
BUT THERE ARE COMPANIES THAT

01:55:32.258 --> 01:55:35.028
THEN COLLECT VAST AND THEN SELL

01:55:35.094 --> 01:55:36.996
THEM TO OTHER COMPANIES THAT

01:55:37.063 --> 01:55:39.399
USE THAT DATA TO THEN CONTINUE

01:55:39.465 --> 01:55:41.167
TO MARKET TO US TO SELL US

01:55:41.234 --> 01:55:43.002
THINGS. IS NOT DARK WEB

01:55:43.069 --> 01:55:45.171
ACTIVITY BUT HOW WOULD THIS

01:55:45.238 --> 01:55:47.473
IMPACT THAT BECAUSE COULD YOU

01:55:47.540 --> 01:55:49.509
THEN ENTER DOWN YOU KNOW ENTER

01:55:49.575 --> 01:55:52.378
INTO DISCUSSIONS ABOUT IF THAT

01:55:52.445 --> 01:55:54.280
IS LAWFUL OR NOT BECAUSE THAT.

01:55:54.347 --> 01:55:56.082
I MEAN THAT IS USING DATA THAT

01:55:56.149 --> 01:55:57.317
YOU HAVE AN EXPLICITLY

01:55:57.383 --> 01:55:59.652

IT IS BEING COMPILED- AND SOLD

01:56:03.289 --> 01:56:06.092
OR SHARED. TO COMPANIES OTHER

01:56:06.159 --> 01:56:10.630
THAN USING IT. NUMBER SO HOW

01:56:10.697 --> 01:56:12.598
DOES THIS IMPACT THE VAST WITH

01:56:12.665 --> 01:56:14.400
THIS MAKE THOSE KINDS OF

01:56:14.467 --> 01:56:16.703
EXCHANGES UNLAWFUL. FOR A FEW

01:56:16.769 --> 01:56:18.705
YEARS AGO IT HAS THE- HISTORIC

01:56:18.771 --> 01:56:20.273
CITY PA THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER

01:56:20.340 --> 01:56:22.642
PRIVACY ACT OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN

01:56:22.709 --> 01:56:23.876
WHICH WOULD BASICALLY GIVE THE

01:56:23.943 --> 01:56:25.345
CONSUMER THE RIGHT TO. YOU KNOW

01:56:25.411 --> 01:56:26.346

ASSURING YOUR INFORMATION. AND

01:56:33.386 --> 01:56:34.854
THEN A COUPLE YEARS AGO WE ALSO

01:56:34.921 --> 01:56:36.055
PASSED A LAW REGARDING DATA

01:56:36.122 --> 01:56:38.524
BROKERS SO WE ARE BASICALLY

01:56:38.591 --> 01:56:40.827
PROHIBITING YOU KNOW THE DARK

01:56:40.893 --> 01:56:45.264

YOU KNOW THAT'S A- ILLEGALLY.

01:56:49.902 --> 01:56:51.637
AND THIS IS JUST TO CLOSE THAT

01:56:51.704 --> 01:56:56.542
LOOPHOLE. TO SO- CURRENTLY IT

01:56:56.609 --> 01:56:57.510
IS ILLEGAL TO HACK INTO

01:56:57.577 --> 01:56:59.479
SOMEBODY'S. COMPUTER FOR DATA

01:56:59.545 --> 01:57:01.581
FOR EXAMPLE SO THAT'S ALREADY

01:57:01.647 --> 01:57:02.715
COVERED UNDER ANOTHER CODE

01:57:02.782 --> 01:57:05.017
SECTION. BUT THE DATA THAT HAS

01:57:05.084 --> 01:57:06.719
BEEN CALLED. HACKED INTO AND

01:57:06.786 --> 01:57:08.721
SOUL SUBSEQUENTLY FURTHER

01:57:08.788 --> 01:57:10.957
DOWNSTREAM. AND THAT'S NOT.

01:57:11.023 --> 01:57:13.326
ILLEGAL INDUCTEE OF THE LAW IS

01:57:13.393 --> 01:57:15.528
SILENT ON DOT SUIT THIS BILL

01:57:15.595 --> 01:57:16.829

01:57:16.896 --> 01:57:18.998
LOOPHOLE BY SAYING LOOK IF

01:57:19.065 --> 01:57:20.833
YOU'RE DOWNSTREAM FOLKS WHO

01:57:20.900 --> 01:57:23.603

01:57:26.806 --> 01:57:28.608
NOT SELL OR USE IT. SO WE'RE

01:57:28.674 --> 01:57:30.977
TRYING TO KIND OF. YOU KNOW OF

01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:15.988
SITUATION WHERE THE CHAMBER
