NAPA FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. AND

00:16:24.983 --> 00:16:26.251
WE HAVE BEEN INTEGRATING

00:16:26.318 --> 00:16:27.986
TECHNOLOGY INTO EVERYTHING WE

00:16:28.053 --> 00:16:30.823
DO BUT WHEN THE PANDEMIC HIT

00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:32.358
AND WE HAD TO PUT THE TWO

00:16:32.424 --> 00:16:34.360
CHILDREN DOING REMOTE LEARNING

00:16:34.426 --> 00:16:36.929
MORE DISTANCE LEARNING. WE DID

00:16:36.995 --> 00:16:38.697
WHAT MOST EXPECTED WE WENT OUT

00:16:38.764 --> 00:16:40.632
WE PURCHASE DEVICES FOR ANY

00:16:40.699 --> 00:16:42.301
CHILD WHO DIDN'T HAVE ONE THE

00:16:42.368 --> 00:16:43.435
PURCHASE TALK ABOUT THEM WE

00:16:43.502 --> 00:16:45.637
SEND THEM HOME. BUT THE PROBLEM

00:16:45.704 --> 00:16:48.507
IS A HOT SPOT WON'T WORK IF YOU

00:16:48.574 --> 00:16:50.442
DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:52.578
FOR IT TO CONNECT TO. AND SO

00:16:52.644 --> 00:16:54.646
WHO GOT HURT BY THAT THE KIDS

00:16:54.713 --> 00:16:56.982
IN THE MOST RURAL AREAS THE

00:16:57.049 --> 00:16:58.817

00:16:58.884 --> 00:17:00.686
DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:17:00.753 --> 00:17:02.287
NEAR THEIR HOME. WE'VE TALKED

00:17:02.354 --> 00:17:04.056

HAVE APPROPRIATE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:17:08.193 --> 00:17:09.862
AND WE COMPARE IT TO HAVING

00:17:09.928 --> 00:17:11.864
ELECTRICITY BACK IN THE DAY.

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:14.400
IT'S CRITICAL THAT EVERY CHILD

00:17:14.466 --> 00:17:15.634
HAD THE APPROPRIATE

00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:18.003
INFRASTRUCTURE NOT JUST IN

00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:20.172

00:17:20.239 --> 00:17:21.673

SAID THAT THIS IS THE SECOND

00:19:05.511 --> 00:19:08.714
COMING OF SHERMAN WAY SAYS SB

SIX FORTY NINE FIRST FROM

SEVERAL YEARS AGO. AND THAT WAS

00:19:12.284 --> 00:19:14.887

IN THE MEANTIME THE FEDERAL

COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION DID

00:19:26.198 --> 00:19:29.101

SAYS BILL IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN-

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:32.538
AND THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE

00:19:32.604 --> 00:19:34.873
TODAY IS THAT NUMEROUS CITIES

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.643

00:19:37.709 --> 00:19:40.445

INTO COMPLIANCE WITH FCC

00:20:01.667 --> 00:20:03.869

00:20:03.936 --> 00:20:05.537
A COST FORMULA THAT IS ALREADY

00:20:05.604 --> 00:20:07.472

PRESERVE ALL LOCAL CONTROL OVER

JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS

00:46:30.287 --> 00:46:32.356
THE FOR THE AUTHOR IF AT

00:46:32.422 --> 00:46:32.890

WE'VE GOT YES PLEASE SENATOR

00:46:38.762 --> 00:46:43.133
DODD SO- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING-

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.736
AS READING YOUR BILL- THAT THIS

00:46:45.802 --> 00:46:47.404
DOES NOT CREATE AN AMBIGUITY

00:46:47.471 --> 00:46:49.673
BUT KINDA CENTRALIZES OR MAKES

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:52.276
THINGS LEVEL ACROSS THE STATE

00:46:52.342 --> 00:46:54.244
BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING IS IT.

00:46:54.311 --> 00:46:55.946
CURRENT LAW ALLOWS DIFFERENT

00:46:56.013 --> 00:46:57.214
CITIES TO MAKE DIFFERENT RULES

00:46:57.281 --> 00:47:00.083
OR DIFFERENT AND THE SCHEDULES

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:01.752
DIFFERENT AND YOU KNOW

00:47:01.818 --> 00:47:04.021
REGULATORY PROCESSES AND THIS

00:47:04.087 --> 00:47:05.355
STILL KIND OF JUST STREAMLINES

00:47:05.422 --> 00:47:07.024
IT SO THAT THE COMMUNICATIONS

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:09.626
INDUSTRY CAN. AND INTO THE

00:47:09.693 --> 00:47:12.529
INFRASTRUCTURE UP THAT WE NEED

00:47:12.596 --> 00:47:14.131
FOR WIRELESS COMMUNICATION-

00:47:14.198 --> 00:47:15.332
ACROSS THE STATE EVEN A REAL

00:47:15.399 --> 00:47:17.968
COMMUNITIES MY RIGHT OR WRONG.

00:47:18.035 --> 00:47:20.103
YOU'RE RIGHT SAID IN A GRAVE.

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:25.309
OKAY M. SO IT DOESN'T CREATE

00:47:25.375 --> 00:47:28.712
AMBIGUITY INCREASE CONSISTENCY

00:47:28.779 --> 00:47:30.280
I HAD TO CITIES THAT WERE IN

00:47:30.347 --> 00:47:31.782
OPPOSITION I TALK TO YOU ABOUT

00:47:31.848 --> 00:47:32.616
THE AMENDMENTS THAT THEY NEEDED

00:47:32.683 --> 00:47:35.085
AND YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH

00:47:35.152 --> 00:47:35.919
THEM AND THEY HAVE REMOVED

00:47:35.986 --> 00:47:37.187
THEIR OPPOSITION BECAUSE YOU

00:47:37.254 --> 00:47:38.722
WERE SO GRACIOUS TO WORK WITH

00:47:38.789 --> 00:47:40.557
THEM SO I THINK YOU FOR THAT

00:47:40.624 --> 00:47:42.125
AND THE OTHER QUESTION THAT I

00:47:42.192 --> 00:47:43.894
HAD IS THERE'S A LOT OF

00:47:43.961 --> 00:47:46.063
CONCERNS THAT THIS YOUR BILL

00:47:46.129 --> 00:47:48.765
REMOVES MONEY FROM WILDFIRE

00:47:48.832 --> 00:47:52.002
PROTECTION- WELFARE- AND I

00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:53.070
DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE EITHER

00:47:53.136 --> 00:47:55.105
I THINK YOU GET A PORTION. OF

00:47:55.172 --> 00:47:56.406
CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS IN MY NOT

00:47:56.473 --> 00:47:57.708
RIGHT I'M I COULD BE WRONG ON

00:47:57.774 --> 00:47:58.875
THAT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHERE

00:47:58.942 --> 00:47:59.443
THE FUNDING MECHANISM COMES

00:47:59.509 --> 00:48:01.745
FROM BUT IT'S THIS MONEY DOES

00:48:01.812 --> 00:48:05.148
NOT COME FROM WELFARE

00:48:05.215 --> 00:48:05.616
PROTECTION OR WILDFIRE

00:48:05.682 --> 00:48:07.517
MITIGATION. I CONSIDER GROW BY

00:48:07.584 --> 00:48:08.885
PRITCHETT THE QUESTION BECAUSE

00:48:08.952 --> 00:48:10.654
IF YOU DON'T WIN THESE. RUMORS

00:48:10.721 --> 00:48:11.922
ARE OUT THERE THAT REALLY

00:48:11.989 --> 00:48:14.324
DETRACTS FROM. THE EFFICACY OF

00:48:14.391 --> 00:48:16.260
THIS BILL AND- NONE OF THE

00:48:16.326 --> 00:48:18.362
MONEY. I'M NOT EVEN SURE

00:48:18.428 --> 00:48:20.163
THERE'S ANY GOVERNMENT MONEY.

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:22.299
GOING TO THIS EFFORT THIS IS

00:48:22.366 --> 00:48:23.533
MONEY THAT'S BEING. PAID BY THE

00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:26.937
TELECOMMUNICATIONS. INDUSTRY SO

00:48:27.004 --> 00:48:29.206
NO STATE MONEY. PROBABLY NO

00:48:29.273 --> 00:48:30.707
STATEMENT I'M JUST GONNA SAY

00:48:30.774 --> 00:48:31.875
PROBABLY NO STATE MONEY IS

00:48:31.942 --> 00:48:34.411
GOING HERE AT ALL- BUT I WILL

00:48:34.478 --> 00:48:36.747
TELL YOU UNEQUIVOCALLY NO MONEY

00:48:36.813 --> 00:48:38.682
THAT IS DESIGNATED. FOR

00:48:38.749 --> 00:48:43.620
WILDFIRE- EITHER SUPPRESSION OR

00:48:43.687 --> 00:48:46.089
PREVENTION IS GOING HERE. OKAY

00:48:46.156 --> 00:48:48.558
AND- I KNOW THIS QUESTION MAY

00:48:48.625 --> 00:48:51.194
BE A LITTLE OUT THERE

00:48:51.261 --> 00:48:52.863
ESPECIALLY IN THIS FLOOR. BUT

00:48:52.929 --> 00:48:54.431
OU'RE NOT PURPOSELY PUTTING

00:48:54.498 --> 00:48:55.532
THIS BILL FORWARD SO THAT

00:48:55.599 --> 00:48:59.436
PEOPLE CAN BE SPIED ON CORRECT.

00:48:59.503 --> 00:49:01.104
THAT COULD BE WHAT. THERE IS A

00:49:01.171 --> 00:49:03.607
LOT OF ACCUSATIONS ABOUT IN THE

00:49:03.674 --> 00:49:05.509
OPPOSITION THAT THIS BILL WILL

00:49:05.575 --> 00:49:07.477
FURTHER ALLOW GOVERNMENT TO SPY

00:49:07.544 --> 00:49:09.246
ON THEM THAT THAT'S NOT TRUE I

00:49:09.313 --> 00:49:10.514
COULDN'T SEE ANY OF THAT IN

OF FOLKS ON THIS ISSUE. AND I

00:51:14.638 --> 00:51:16.239
KNOW THAT SOME FOLKS IN MY

00:51:16.306 --> 00:51:19.109

00:51:19.176 --> 00:51:23.079
CONCERNS TO THIS BILL- BELIEVED

THAT THE AUTHOR IS TAKEN. OFF

00:51:38.662 --> 00:51:39.963

ONGOING SO THIS IS VERY MUCH A

00:51:45.969 --> 00:51:47.537
WORK IN PROGRESS. SOME OF THE

00:51:47.604 --> 00:51:48.772
POINTS THAT WERE BROUGHT TO MY

00:51:48.839 --> 00:51:49.806
ATTENTION THAT I THINK ARE

00:51:49.873 --> 00:51:53.510
WORTH MENTIONING. IS THAT THIS

00:51:53.577 --> 00:51:55.212
WOULD THAT THESE WOULD ONLY GO

00:51:55.278 --> 00:51:59.282
ON EXISTING. POLLS IN THE

00:51:59.349 --> 00:52:01.451
TRANSMISSION RIGHT OF WAY THAT

00:52:01.518 --> 00:52:06.456
THIS IS- NOT GOING INTO- ON

00:52:06.523 --> 00:52:09.860
REGULATED OR ON AUTHORIZED. YES

00:52:09.926 --> 00:52:11.661
AND IF I MAY ALSO ASK THE

00:52:11.728 --> 00:52:13.230
AUTHOR IF YOU CAN JUST KIND OF

00:52:13.296 --> 00:52:15.398
JUST GENERICALLY CONFIRM THAT

00:52:15.465 --> 00:52:16.366
THESE ARE SOME OF THE POINTS

00:52:16.433 --> 00:52:18.335
THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED IN THE

00:52:18.401 --> 00:52:19.536
SECOND IS THAT IT WOULD

00:52:19.603 --> 00:52:22.572
STANDARDIZE THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS

00:52:22.639 --> 00:52:25.342
THAT WOULD BE. CHARGED TO THE

00:52:25.408 --> 00:52:30.313
CARRIER OR PROVIDER. ON A MORE-

00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:32.782
A FORMULAIC BASIS BASED ON WHAT

00:52:32.849 --> 00:52:35.418
IS BEING CHARGED FOR THE

00:52:35.485 --> 00:52:37.420
TELEPHONE POLES FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:52:37.487 --> 00:52:40.290
AESTHETICS IN BEAUTIFICATION-

00:52:40.357 --> 00:52:43.827
AUTHORITY STILL REMAINS WITH

00:52:43.894 --> 00:52:44.728
THE MUNICIPALITY WHERE THE

00:52:44.794 --> 00:52:47.097
RELEVANT ON A GOVERNMENT

00:52:47.163 --> 00:52:49.266
ENTITY. SO LONG AS IT IS

00:52:49.332 --> 00:52:50.901
CONSISTENT WITH WHAT IS ALREADY

00:52:50.967 --> 00:52:54.604
ON THE POLLS AND- THE

00:52:54.671 --> 00:52:58.208
TRANSMISSION AREAS- I THINK

00:52:58.275 --> 00:52:59.843
MAKING CERTAIN THAT WE HAVE

00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:03.547
SUFFICIENT SPEED. WHETHER B.

00:53:03.613 --> 00:53:05.181
TWO FIVE G. AND THE FACT THAT

00:53:05.248 --> 00:53:06.650
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIVE G. A.

00:53:06.716 --> 00:53:08.685
STILL CONSTRUCTION MY HEAD AS

00:53:08.752 --> 00:53:10.687
WERE ALREADY MAKING INROADS

00:53:10.754 --> 00:53:13.223
INTO A SIX G. WORLD- BUT

00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:13.990
NONETHELESS THESE ARE

00:53:14.057 --> 00:53:16.192
IMPORTANT- INFRASTRUCTURE

00:53:16.259 --> 00:53:17.627
DEVELOPMENTS. THAT ARE

00:53:17.694 --> 00:53:19.729
COMMUNITIES NEED AND NO DOUBT

00:53:19.796 --> 00:53:21.231
THIS WILL BE MORE ORIENTED

00:53:21.298 --> 00:53:24.634
TOWARDS URBAN AREA. BUT WE HAVE

00:53:24.701 --> 00:53:26.503
DESPERATE NEED OF FOR THESE

00:53:26.570 --> 00:53:28.772
TYPES OF TRANSMISSION SERVICES

00:53:28.838 --> 00:53:30.540
AND INFRASTRUCTURE IN RURAL

00:53:30.607 --> 00:53:32.375
AREAS IN A COVE IT HIGHLIGHTED

00:53:32.442 --> 00:53:34.311
ALL OF THAT I HAD TWO KIDS HAD

00:53:34.377 --> 00:53:36.046
TO GO TO SCHOOL REMOTELY JUST

00:53:36.112 --> 00:53:37.847
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE DID OR HAD.

00:53:37.914 --> 00:53:40.483
RELATIVES OR FRIENDS IN THAT

00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:41.651
SITUATION. HAVING ACCESS TO

00:53:41.718 --> 00:53:43.453
SPEED IN THIS TYPE OF

00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:45.789
INFRASTRUCTURE. IS JUST NOW IN

00:53:45.855 --> 00:53:48.191
ESSENTIAL LEVEL OF SERVICE. SO

00:53:48.258 --> 00:53:49.392
I WILL GO FURTHER THAN THAT

00:53:49.459 --> 00:53:51.094
EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT. EVEN

00:53:51.161 --> 00:53:53.697
THOUGH I HAVE RECEIVED CONCERNS

00:53:53.763 --> 00:53:55.765

MATTER OF COURTESY BUT ALSO I

00:54:00.804 --> 00:54:01.738

00:54:01.805 --> 00:54:03.373
DIRECTION THEY'LL BE SUPPORTIVE

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:05.976
OF THIS TODAY. I'D LIKE TO SEE

00:54:06.042 --> 00:54:06.643

00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:09.546
LOOK LIKE- WHAT HITS THE FLOOR

00:54:09.613 --> 00:54:11.481

FOLKS TO TRY TO RESOLVE. MOST

00:54:19.522 --> 00:54:21.224
OF THE OUTSTANDING ISSUES IF I

00:54:21.291 --> 00:54:22.826
CAN JUST GET CONFIRMATION FROM

00:54:22.892 --> 00:54:24.227

00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:47.984
BECAUSE OF THE MEN THAT WE

00:54:48.051 --> 00:54:50.587

00:54:50.654 --> 00:54:51.454

ALL ON ONE TOWER. YOU KNOW IT

00:54:57.794 --> 00:55:00.030
WOULD YIELD. THE COMMUNITY

00:55:00.096 --> 00:55:01.331
COMPANY WOULD BEAR THE EXPENSE

00:55:01.398 --> 00:55:03.833
OF PUTTING IN ANOTHER TOWER OR

SHARED CONTROL. SO THAT- PROPER

00:55:26.423 --> 00:55:28.391
INFRASTRUCTURE CAN BE PUT INTO

00:55:28.458 --> 00:55:32.028
PLACE IN THOSE. THOSE

DEADLINES HAD A SAFETY. MOST

02:02:50.262 --> 02:02:51.063

02:32:25.236 --> 02:32:26.036

02:32:26.103 --> 02:32:27.371
MOMENT BEFORE I CLOSE JUST

02:32:27.438 --> 02:32:28.772

USUALLY ONE OF THE CHALLENGE SO

02:46:39.255 --> 02:46:41.491
OFTEN TIMES ARE NONPROFIT

02:46:41.558 --> 02:46:43.827

02:46:47.430 --> 02:46:49.332
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE FARMWORKERS

02:46:49.399 --> 02:46:51.768
UNION AND DIFFERENT NONPROFITS

02:46:51.835 --> 02:46:52.402
THAT WORK WITH LOW INCOME

02:46:52.469 --> 02:46:56.172
COMMUNITIES THAT- REACH OUT AND

02:46:56.239 --> 02:46:58.641
TRY TO GET PEOPLE TO QUALIFY

A LONG LIST OF- CONTRACTORS

02:47:05.615 --> 02:47:07.584
THAT PERFORM THIS WORK. AND

02:47:07.650 --> 02:47:09.486
THEY ALSO ON THEIR OWN DIME

02:47:09.552 --> 02:47:11.955
OFTENTIMES REACH OUT AND MARKET

02:47:12.021 --> 02:47:13.656
THESE PROGRAMS PUBLICLY SO THAT

02:47:13.723 --> 02:47:15.525
PEOPLE COULD BE MADE AWARE THAT

02:47:19.996 --> 02:47:22.132
ALL THESE DIFFERENT METHODS OF
