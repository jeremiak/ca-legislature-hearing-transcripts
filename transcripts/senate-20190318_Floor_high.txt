HOWEVER WITH PROPER CARE AND ACCESS TO CONFERENCE OF MEDICAL ATTENTION PEOPLE THIS RARE CONDITION CAN CONTROL THE BLEEDING EPISODES AND ARE ABLE TO LEAVE FULL PRODUCTIVE LIVES.

NAY BIRCH BY. SOME OF US OLDER FOLKS REMEMBER HIM AND NOT HIS SON EVAN BY WHO SUCCEEDED HIM. IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. IF I COULD GET THE ATTENTION OF MY COLLEAGUES PLEASE. BIRCH BY WAS TRULY AN EXTRAORDINARY LEGISLATOR AND UNITED STATES SENATOR WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE. FOR SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT LEGISLATION THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE MODERN AMERICAN ERA. STARTING WITH MY PERSONAL FAVORITE TITLE NINE HE WAS ACTUALLY THE CHIEF ARCHITECT OF TITLE NINE WHICH PASSED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO GIVING WOMEN THE RIGHT TO COMPETE EQUALLY IN EDUCATION AND IN SPORTS. AND HIS LEGACY NOW IS REFLECTED IN THE EXTRAORDINARY OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE SEE IN OUR DAUGHTERS AND OUR SISTERS AND IN SOME INSTANCES. OUR MOTHERS WHO HAVE NOW BEEN GIVEN THE CHANCE. TO PARTICIPATE IN IN LIFE ON AN EQUAL FOOTING WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATION. WHEN IT COMES TO THE WORKPLACE HE KNOWS EDUCATION WAS GOING TO BE THE MOST CRITICAL COMPONENT TO OPENING THE DOOR FOR QUALITY FOR WOMEN? AND HE WAS ABLE TO GET THIS MEASURE PASSED IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO IT CAME AT A TIME WHEN WOMEN EARN FEWER THAN 10% OF ALL MEDICAL AND LAW DEGREES AND FEWER THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS ONE IN. TWENTY SEVEN PLAYED SPORTS. FAST FORWARD TODAY WE REALIZE THAT THERE ARE MORE WOMEN GRADUATING COLLEGE THAN MEN AND ONE OUT OF EVERY TWO YOUNG WOMEN. PARTICIPATES IN EITHER HIGH SCHOOL OR COLLEGE SPORTS AN EXTRAORDINARY ACCOMPLISHMENT BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT HE WAS ONE OF THE LEADING PROPONENTS. FOR THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT. HE ALSO WAS THE PRINCIPAL ARCHITECT FOR BOTH THE TWENTY FIFTH AND TWENTY SIX THE MEMONS TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION THE TWENTY FIFTH PLANNING FOR SUCCESSION AFTER A PRESIDENT -- HAS LEFT OFFICE IN THIS CASE IT WAS AFTER THE ASSASSINATION OF JOHN F. KENNEDY. THE POSITIONOF VICE PRESIDENT WHEN VACANT FOR A YEAR UNTIL THE TWENTY FIFTH AMENDMENT WAS PRESENTED AND PASSED AND OF COURSE THE TWENTY SIXTH AMENDMENT WHICH PROVIDED THE OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE TO VOTE AT THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME WE HAD THE VERY CONTENTIOUS. VIETNAM WAR WHERE WE WERE SENDING PRIMARILY OUR YOUNG MEN OVERSEAS TO FIGHT A WAR WHEN THEY WERE EIGHTEEN AND YET THEY COULD HAVE NO SAY IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS UNTIL THEY WERE TWENTY ONE HE WAS THE PRINCIPAL ARCHITECT. FOR CHANGING THAT SO THAT NOW YOUNG PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO VOTE AT THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN HE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY MAN SERVED EIGHTEEN YEARS -- IN I BELIEVE IT WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS FROM NINETEEN SIXTY THREE TO NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND IN FACT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO HE WAS CONSIDERING A RUN. FOR PRESIDENT. BUT HIS BREAST CANCER AND HE CHOSE NOT TO TO DO THAT BUT HIS LEGACY WILL LIVE. IN THE ANNALS OF OUR COUNTRY WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL FOR PEOPLE LIKE BIRCH BY TO HAVE SERVED HIS COUNTRY TO OF RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF EQUALITY FOR ALL. TO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING SURE THAT THIS COUNTRY WAS ON A COURSE WHERE ALL PEOPLE WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO A QUALITY. AND SO IT IS WITH BOTH A HEAVY HEART AND A DEGREE OF ENORMOUS APPRECIATION THAT I ASKED THAT WE IN TURN IN THE MEMORY OF SENATOR BIRCH BY OF INDIANA.
