FILE I. AB TWENTY FIVE TEN MISTER MAYOR SUTURES BEEN PULLED BY THE COMMITTEE. AND WHAT AND WHAT THAT WILL START WITH ITEM SEVEN AB TWENTY NINE THIRTY ADMISSIBLE. THINK. GOOD AFTERNOON MR VICE CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO THANK GOD OF THE CHAIR AND HER STAFF FOR THEIR ATTENTION TO THIS BILL AND. THERE'S AN AMENDMENT RECOMMENDATION AND COMMENT SEE THAT WE WILL WORK WITH COMMITTEE TO INCORPORATE INTO THE. INTO THE BILL TODAY I'M PRESENTING MOVED TO BILL AB TWENTY NINE THIRTY EIGHT MUCH OF WOULD ALLOW THE CITY OF SANTA MONICA TWO YEARS TO ALIGN AND ADJUST THEIR. TAX ELECTION TO BETTER MATCH. TAX COLLECTIONS OF OTHER BIKE SHARE SYSTEMS AND LA COUNTY. BUT SHARE AS SITE I'M SURE YOU ALL KNOW HAS BECOME A POPULAR STRATEGY FOR ENCOURAGING ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION DECREASING VEHICLE TRIPS AND HELPING CITIES COUNTIES AND REGIONAL AGENCIES ACHIEVE LOCAL AND STATE. TRANSPORTATION AND EMISSION REDUCTION GOALS. SANTA MONICA LAUNCHED LA COUNTY'S FIRST BIKESHARE SYSTEM IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TODAY SERVES OVER EIGHTY THOUSAND ACTIVE USERS USERS SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT. OF THOSE YEARS BEING LA COUNTY RESIDENTS SANTA MONICA AND MANY OTHER CITIES IN LA COUNTY HAVE CREATED. CITY OPERATED BY CHAIR SYSTEMS THAT ARE WORKING TO INTEGRATE AND REGIONAL ALLIES THEIR PROGRAMS WHICH IN AN AREA LIKE A LA COUNTY CAN IMAGINE IS. VERY COMPLICATED A REGIONAL SYSTEM WOULD PROVIDE AN EXPANDED SYSTEM TO INCREASE ACCESS IMPROVE SERVICE AND ENCOURAGE MORE PEOPLE. TO BIKE IN THEIR COMMUTES BETWEEN CITIES ONE BARRIER REACH ALLIES IN THE BIKE SHARE SYSTEM IS BEEN THAT DIFFERENCES IN TAX COLLECTIONS BETWEEN THE CITIES. AND TO SERVE THIS BILL SEEKS TO REMEDY THAT FOR SANTA MONICA THE DIFFERENCES IN TAX COLLECTIONS MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE. TO USE INTEGRATED SOFTWARE FOR A OF VARIOUS BIKESHARE SYSTEMS THAT CURRENTLY EXIST AND MIGHT EXIST IN THE FUTURE. AB TWENTY NINE THIRTY EIGHT REMOVED THIS BARRIER AND BY EXTENSION HELPS TO INCREASE. BIKE USE IN LA COUNTY WITH ME I HAVE HOMELESS ANIMAL REPRESENTING THE. CITY OF SANTA MONICA TO SPEAK MORE ABOUT THE BILL AN ANSWER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. GOOD AFTERNOON MR VICE CHAIR MEMBERS MONTHS AMMAN BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SANTA MONICA I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THE ANALYSIS IN THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT. AS NOTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM THIS BILL IS CRITICAL IN FACILITATING THE INTEGRATION OF ST MONICA'S POPULAR BREEZE BIKESHARE PROGRAM. WITH SIMILAR BIKESHARE PROGRAMS IN NEIGHBORING CITIES AND WITH UCLA. THE BREEZE BIKESHARE PROGRAM WAS IMPLEMENTED IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND AT THE TIME WE CHOSE TO PAY USE TAX ON THE RENTAL RECEIPTS THE BIKES. HOWEVER IT NOW THAT OTHER CITIES IN OUR REGION ARE ATTEMPTING TO IMPLEMENT A REGIONAL BIKESHARE SYSTEM THE CITY HAS STYMIED DUE TO OUR TAX ELECTION WHICH IS DIFFERENT AND THE ELECTION CHOSEN BY THE OTHER CITIES THAT PAID THE SALES TAX WHEN THEY PURCHASE THEIR BICYCLES. PROVIDING A PERSPECTIVE USE TAX EXEMPTION ON THE BY SCHOOLS PURCHASE IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN IT WILL ALLOW THE BREEZE BIKES TO BE INTEGRATED WITH OTHER SYSTEMS. AND ALSO ALLOW US TO ADD A SECOND GROUPOF TAX PAID BIKES INTO SECULAR NATION. ORIGINAL BIKESHARE PROGRAM WILL LEAD TO INCREASED USE OF THESE BIKES AS WELL AS REDUCE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND REDUCE EMISSIONS. FOR THESE REASONS THE CITY OF SAN MONICA SPONSORING THIS MEASURE AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. OTHER INNOCENTS FOR. WITNESSES OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE. AND YOU AGREED TO BE AMENDMENTS TO DELETE SECTION A AND B. M. PROVIDE A PERSPECTIVE USE TAX EXEMPTION FOR THE FIVE HUNDRED BICYCLES PURCHASED IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN CORRECT. YES THEY DO ALRIGHT FANTASTIC. ANY COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. QUESTIONS COMMENTS SEEN NO ENJOYED CLOSE. THANK A MANAGER GOOD AFTERNOON HIGH I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. WELL WE HAD WE ON OF A QUORUM WE DON'T HARM SO. THE RECOMMENDATION WILL BE DO PASS BUT WE WILL GET. WE WILL TAKE A VOTE WILL HAVE COURT THANK YOU. DO PASS AS AMENDED. BUT. ITEM NUMBER SIX AB TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY. TO HARPER WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN. ABSOLUTELY. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I'M HERE PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY WHICH WILL PROHIBIT THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD OR ANY OTHER PUBLIC OR PRIVATE ENTITY FROM CONDUCTING A WAGE GARNISHMENT. OR BANK LEVY FOR THE COLLECTION OF UNPAID TOLLS OR TWELVE ASIAN PENALTIES. CALIFORNIANS OFTEN USED HOLE ROADS OR BRIDGES TO COMMUTE TO WORK OR EVEN TRAVEL. THEY THE PAY THE TOLL WITH CASH OR HAVE A TOLL ACCOUNT WITH THE FAST TRACK WORKS PRESS ACCOUNT RATHER MEASURE. WHEN INDIVIDUALS FAILED TO PAY A TOLL THEIR SUBJECT TO PENALTIES THESE PENALTIES CAN RANGE FROM ONLY TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS. FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER PENALTIES IN TWENTY FIFTEEN TOLL AGENCIES WORTH AUTHORIZED TO CONDUCT WAGING BANK LEVEES THROUGH THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AGAINST INDIVIDUALS WHO FAIL TO PAY THEIR TOLL VIOLATIONS. IN ADDITION PENALTY FEES CONTINUE TO ACCRUE ON UNPAID BALANCES WELL WAGING BANK LEVEES ARE IN EFFECT. EVEN THOUGH THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD ONLY GETS INVOLVED AFTER A PERSON IS EXHAUSTED THE APPEALS PROCESS. TO OVERTURN PULL VIOLATIONS ALL FINES AND PENALTIES HAVE TO BE PAID UP FRONT BEFORE THAT PROCESS CAN EVEN BEGIN. IF SOMEONE HAS TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND PULL VIOLATIONS AND UNPAID. AND ADDITIONAL PENALTIES IT IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY HIGHLY LIKELY THAT THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO FILE AN APPEAL. NOT APPEALING THE TOLL VIOLATIONS CAN LEAD TO WAGE GARNISHMENT THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD HAS THE AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT WAGE CAR CARTMAN'S FOR UP TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S PAYCHECK. THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO GARNISH THE WAGES OF A DEBTOR SPOUTS IS WELL. THAT MEANS A CALIFORNIA FAMILIES AT RISK TO HAVE ONE QUARTER OF THEIR MONTHLY INCOME TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM. THIS HURTS THEIR ABILITY TO KEEP FOOD ON THE TABLE CLOTHES ON THEIR BACKS ON A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD. NUMEROUS RESIDENTS IN ORANGE COUNTY OF RECEIVED MASSIVE FINES FOR TOLL VIOLATIONS IN THESE INCLUDE BRING ON PABLO GONZALEZ. WHO FAILED TO PAY SIXTY DOLLARS AND FOURTEEN CENTS AND TOLLS BUT THEY WERE BILLED SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DOLLARS IN PENALTIES? STEPHANIE AND BRIAN YOUNG. RACKED UP FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DOLLARS IN UNPAID TOLLS AFTER CREDIT CARD LINK TO THEIR TRANSPONDER ACCOUNT EXPIRED BUT THEY PASTE FACED FIFTY THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS IN FINES. AND SHERRY HUTTON WHO IS UNAWARE THAT HER FAST TRACK PASSED WAS NO LONGER LINKED TO OUR BANK ACCOUNT. HER PENALTIES AND LATE FEES ADDED UP TO MORE THAN FORTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS. CURLY TOLL AGENCIES HAVE THE ABILITY TO IMPOSE LESS INTRUSIVE MEANS OF COLLECTING UNPAID TOLL OF ASIAN PENALTIES. THESE INCLUDE PLACING HOLD ON THE VEHICLE'S REGISTRATION OBTAINING A CIVIL JUDGMENT CONTRACTING WITH COLLECTION AGENCIES DEDUCTING FROM A TAX REFUND OR PLACING A LIEN ON THE VEHICLE ITSELF. WITH CALIFORNIA BEING ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE STATES TO LIVE AND RESIDENTS CANNOT AFFORD. THEIR EARNED INCOME TO BE FORCIBLY TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM BECAUSE OF JUST AN HONEST MISTAKE. THIS BILL WOULD PROTECT CALIFORNIANS FROM BEING PUSHED INTO POVERTY BECAUSE OF MINOR PULL VIOLATIONS WITH ME HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY. IS JOSH BARNETT REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA BUS ASSOCIATION. WHO IS IN SUPPORT? MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS JOSH PAWNEE BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA BUS ASSOCIATION. THE ASSOCIATION TOOK A LOOK AT THIS AND THERE HAVE BEEN PROBLEMS THAT THEIR DRIVERS EIGHTY PLUS COMPANIES HAVE HAD. WITH TOLD. ISSUES THAT THIS AND OTHER TOOL ISSUES. SO THAT THEY WOULD URGE YOUR SUPPORT. FOR THIS MEASURE AYE AS JUST A PLAIN AND SIMPLE PIECE OF COMMON SENSE IT SHOULD BE IN LAW. ARE SO THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SPORT. WHEN THIS IS IN OPPOSITION. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE DUCTWORK. ARM. SO IN. YOU'VE CONVINCED ME TO VOTE I ON THE BILL THANK YOU. BUT WHAT IT WHAT BOTHERS ME IS HOW FROM A SIMPLE ERROR LIKE YEAH EXPIRATION OF A CREDIT CARD YOU MISS THE NOTIFICATION. THAT THEY CAN END UP FINDING YOU TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. I THINK MAYBE THAT'S THE BASIS OF THE PROBLEM. AND I THINK IT SOME POINT WE OUGHT TO BE ADDRESSING THAT I MEAN THESE THESE. THAT JUST SEEMS EXCESSIVE. I WOULD AGREE AND I THINK THAT OF VERY OFTEN. TOLL ROADS AND TOLL BRIDGES ARE THE WAY TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE IMPORTANT INFRASTRUCTURE. THE CHALLENGE IS HOW DO WE GET A SITUATION WHERE SOMETHING LIKE THIS GETS OUT OF CONTROL. AND THE SPECIFICS OF THIS BILL. AT LEAST THE WAGE GARNISHMENT WHICH I THINK IS THE MOST INTRUSIVE WAY TO BE ABLE YEAH. SO ANYWAY YES I'LL BE VOTING FOR THE BILL. YOU DID NEXT ON PRESENTATION THAT I WASN'T SURE TO START. SOMETIMES YOU PRESENTATION DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE THANK YOU. BUT AGAIN IF YOU WANT TO BRING A BILL NEXT YEAR. THAT GOES TO THE QUESTION OF WHY THESE AUTHORITY SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN. FINDS ARE I'D BE VERY INTERESTED THANK YOU THANK YOU. MR GRAY. ECHO MY COLLEAGUE'S COMMENTS A. MY. FIRST A BLUSH LOOK THIS WAS WHAT WAS I DID INTEND TO SUPPORT IT. AFTER LISTENING TO YOUR PRESENTATION I'M MORE INCLINED TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF ABSENT QUESTION HAVE YOU EXPLORED THAT AS YOU ALL THROUGH THE MEASURE. IN CAPPING THE FEES SOME REASONABLE. AMOUNT. I. WOULD I HAD LOOKED AT THAT IT WASN'T THE CAPPING THE FEES INITIALLY BUT AS I SAID THAT'S. CERTAINLY. VERY IMPORTANT DIED AND AND I THINK AMERICA PULLED LA. A SUGGESTION ABOUT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO DO HERE WAS SPECIFICALLY THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AND THE LOW WAGE GARNISHMENT DIE ASPECT OF IT. AYE BECAUSE THEY SAY SAID FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ARE NOT OF THE SIGNIFICANT MEANS THAT'S QUITE POSSIBLY AMONG THE MOST DEVASTATING WAYS TO BE ABLE TO TACKLE THE ISSUE. ONE DE ELISE'S ANALYSIS SAYS HER THE EXISTING. LAW ALLOWS THEM TO TAKE THAT ACTION FOR A WHOLE HOST RENDON CHANGED WE TRANSFER SEES. LICENSE FEES USE TAXES PARDON PANEL THERE'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN TO YOU LOOK LATER WHICH I THINK THERE ARE MUCH BETTER TO USE THAN THE FRANCHISE. BUT YOU'RE WILLING TO LOOK AT CAPPING. FEES GOING FORWARD EVEN IN THIS BILL. I'D BE. BUT. I WOULD CERTAINLY I CONSIDER. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE WHICH ELECT CLOSE FAMILY MEMBER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. MORE MORE DRIVER SEIZING TOLL ACCOUNTS TO PAY FOR THEIR COMMUTES AND THE TOLL ROADS AND BRIDGES SINCE DRIVERS MAY NOT BE AWARE THAT THE CREDIT CARDS CONNECTED TO ACCOUNT EXPIRES. VIOLATION SOMETIMES OCCUR BY THIS MINOR VIOLATION SHOULD NOT TO. BE SOMETHING SO DEVASTATING TO OUR FAMILY. FAMILY'S INCOME THEIR JOB BY IN THEIR WAY OF LIFE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM BUT I WILL MAKE A COMMENT MYSELF AND I'M SIMILAR TO. DOCTOR QUIRK AND MISTER GRAY DO. RECOGNIZE THE PROBLEM HOWEVER. IT'S NOT JUST HOLES PARKING HAS THE SAME ISSUES AS WELL SO IN MY OPINION I THINK THEY'RE PROBABLY WAY TO FACILITATE A MORE ELEGANT SOLUTION TO THIS ISSUE. SO FOR THAT REASON I'M A NUN RECOMMENDATION WHEN WE DO HAVE A QUORUM. OF WILLIAM FORMAL TAKE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR I APPRECIATE THE CONSIDERATION OF ALL THE MEMBERS I AM NUMBER FOUR AB TWENTY SIX SIXTY THREE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN JW YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS THAT ALIGN THE BILL WITH PROVISIONS IN PLACE FOR DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS REGISTERED AT THE STATE LEVEL. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR YOUR HELP. PRIOR TO TWO THOUSAND SIX A CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP BETWEEN DOMESTIC PARTNERS WAS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE SAME PROPERTY TAX EXCLUSION THAT APPLY TO MARRIED COUPLES. THANKFULLY SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATION FIX A DISCREPANCY FOR DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS REGISTER AT THE STATE LEVEL. HOWEVER FOR COUPLES WOULD REGISTER THE DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIP WITH THEIR LOCAL COUNTY OR CITY AND NOT AT THE STATE LEVEL THE SAME EXCLUSION HAS NOT BEEN AVAILABLE. WITH THE AMENDMENTS BEFORE YOU TODAY AB TWO SIX SIX THREE WILL CREATE PARITY IN THE LAW FOR ALL REGISTERED DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY'RE ORIGINALLY REGISTERED. SPECIFICALLY A PROPERTY THAT WAS REASSESSED AS A RESULT OF A TRANSFER BETWEEN REGISTERED DOMESTIC PARTNERS BETWEEN JANUARY TWO THOUSAND AND JUNE TWENTY SIXTH TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. CAN RECEIVED A REVERSAL OF THAT REASSESSMENT WITH AN APPLICATION TO THE COUNTY ASSESSOR. THE PROCESS WILL BE ALIGNED WITH WHAT'S CURRENTLY IN PLACE FOR OTHER DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS INCLUDING THE INFORMATION REQUIRED FOR THE APPLICATION. NO ONE SHOULD RISK LOSING THEIR HOME AS A RESULT OF THE DEATH OF THIS PART OF THEIR PARTNER. AB TWENTY SIX SIXTY THREE CLOSES IN UNINTENDED LOOPHOLE ENSURES THAT ALL COUPLES HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO BENEFITS INCLUDING TAX RELIEF. AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP REFINING THE BILL I'VE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE SPONSORS OF AB TWENTY I TWO SIX SIX THREE. THE LA COUNTY ASSESSOR'S OFFICE AND EQUALITY CALIFORNIA HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AND TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS MAY HAVE. I REQUEST REALLY HOUSE FOR AN AYE VOTE. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR BURKE AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS CHRISTINA NGUYEN AND I'M THE ASSESSOR SACRAMENTO COUNTY. I'M HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO SIX SIX THREE AND TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF MY COLLEAGUE ASSESSOR JEFF PRAYING. OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL. ALSO JOINING IN SPONSORSHIP OF THIS LEGISLATION IS ASSESSOR CARMEN CHIU OF SAN FRANCISCO. THE PROBLEM FOR DOMESTIC PARTNERS WHO REGISTERED WITH THE LOCAL JURISDICTION AND NOT THE STATE. THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO UTILIZE THE EXCLUSION FROM REASSESSMENT OF THEIR PROPERTY BASED UPON A CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP. FOR SOME OF THESE LOCAL REGISTER PARTNERS THEIR PROPERTY WAS REVALUED RESULTING IN A INCREASE IN PROERTY TAXES. ASSESSORS LACK AUTHORITY TO REVERSE THE INCREASE IN VALUE AND THERE IS NO RECOURSE TO PROVIDE A REFUND OF THE OVERPAYMENT THAT OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE REASSESSMENT. THE SOLUTION. AB TWO SIX SIX THREE CREATES A LOCAL DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS AND GRANTS TO THOSE PARTNERS OF THE SAME EXCLUSION. FROM A CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP ASK OUT PROVIDED TO STATE REGISTERED DOMESTIC PARTNERS AND TO MARRIED COUPLES. THIS IS A MATTER OF EQUALITY. AND FAIRNESS TO ASSURE THAT LOCAL REGISTER DOMESTIC PARTNERS HAVE THE SAME ACCESS TO THE EXCLUSION FROM A CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP.

AFTER THE DEATH OF THEIR PARTNER OR PERHAPS EVEN LOST THEIR HOME AFTER THE DEATH OF THEIR PARTNER AS A RESULT OF NOT HAVING A REGISTRATION BE I'M AT THE STATE LEVEL. I CAN HAVE SOME SORT OF. AT REIMBURSEMENT FOR THAT ARE RIGHT GUY RECONCILIATION TO RECOVER ON AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT THEY MIGHT HAVE LOST AND I'M WHAT THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO PAY FRANKLY. I'M IF THE EXCLUSION HAD APPLIED TO THEM I'M AND PART OF WHAT THIS IS ABOUT IS THAT PRIOR TO. THE AFFIRMATION OF THE FREEDOM TO MARRY AND CALIFORNIAAND I AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL RELATIONSHIP RECOGNITION FOR SAME SEX COUPLES WITH COMPLEX AND FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS SAME SEX COUPLES WERE OFTEN UNSURE ABOUT WHERE AND HOW THEY COULD REGISTER. AS DOMESTIC PARTNERS AND WHAT PROTECTIONS WOULD COME WITHOUT REGISTRATION AND WHAT WHICH WOULD NOT AYE SO DURING THAT TIME OF CONFUSION AND UNCERTAINTY THAT THE BILL COVERS I'M SAME SEX COUPLES WHO WERE ONLY REGISTERED AT THAT LOCAL LEVEL AND NOT WITH THE STATE. WERE VULNERABLE TO THIS REASSESSMENT ON THE DEATH OF THEIR PARTNER AND I WE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THIS BILL WILL ACCOUNT FOR THAT TIME IN RETROSPECT SO. RESPECTFULLY ARCHER SUPPORTING THANK YOU.

ITEM NUMBER FIVE AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER FLOOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME UP. WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. WAS START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS IN ONE THING THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THESE AMENDMENTS. AS WE ALL KNOW CALIFORNIA'S PRICKLY WITNESS THEM'S. SOME OF THE MOST DEVASTATING FIRES AND FIREFIGHTERS ARE PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE MORE AND MORE TO PROTECT LIVES AND PROPERTY. YEAH WILL THE DEMANDS OF THE FIRE SERVICES ESCALATED MANY DISTRICTS DO NOT HAVE THE SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO COVER THE NECESSARY EXPENSES. THIS IS LOVE FIREFIGHTERS EXPRESSLY VOLUNTEERS TO COVER THE MAJORITY OF THE COSTS HAVING BEEN A FIREFIGHTER FOR MANY YEARS I CAN TELL YOU FIRST HAND HOW MUCH THESE INDIVIDUALS PUT TO THE PROFESSION. BECAUSE OF THIS THE FIRING HISTORY HAS FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO RECRUIT AND RETRAIN FIREFIGHTERS AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN WOULD PROVIDE. A PERSONAL INCOME TAX CREDIT FOR FIREFIGHTERS. UP TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR FOR QUALIFIED JOB RELAYS EXPENSES X. SUCH AS TRAINING AND EQUIPMENT. THIS BILL WOULD AID CURRENT FIREFIGHTERS IN ENHANCE RECRUITMENT EFFORTS BY PROVIDING SENATE TO THOSE WHO WISH TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY. AND THE FIRE INDUSTRY. HERE WITH ME TODAY IS TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL HIS SHASTA COUNTY SUPERVISOR LESS BOND. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM LESS BOSS AS COUNTY SUPERVISOR CURRENTLY SERVING AS CHAIRMAN OF OUR BOARD. THE MAJORITY OF OUR THIRTEEN FIRE DISTRICTS RELY ON VOLUNTEER FORCES INCLUDING EIGHTEEN COMPLETELY VOLUNTEER STATIONS. SHASTA COUNTY IS A MEMBER OF RC RC THE RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES CALIFORNIA. AND ORGANIZATION OF THIRTY FIVE RURAL COUNTIES IN THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. ALL OF OUR COUNTY UTILIZING Y. UPON SERVICES OF VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS. IN MANY OF OUR FIRE DISTRICTS RELY ENTIRELY ON VOLUNTEER EFFORTS. FOR MEMBERS THIS COMMUNITY USE THAT THAT MAKE UP THOSE FORCES THAT PROVIDE CRITICAL PUBLIC SERVICE. RESPONDING TO STRUCTURE FIRES EMERGENCY RESPONSE CALLS AND OFTEN THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE. ON WILDLAND FIRES IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES. IT'S BECOME INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT FOR US. IN RURAL FIRE DISTRICTS TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS IN SHASTA COUNTY ALONE WERE DOWN NEARLY ONE HUNDRED VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS AND THAT'S OVER THE LAST FIVE YEAR TIME FRAME. IN MY DISCUSSIONS WITH OTHER SUPERVISORS IT'S EVIDENT THAT MOST OF THE THIRTY FIVE RURAL COUNTIES HAVE EXPERIENCES SAME TRENDS. THAT THIS PROPOSED TAX CREDIT OF AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN. IS A SMALL RECOGNITION FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE. ATTACKED THE LIVES AND PROPERTIES OF OTHERS WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITY AND ALSO A IN MY PERSPECTIVE DESERVE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF RECOGNITION. REIMBURSING THEM OR GIVING THEM A TAX CREDIT FOR SELF PAY COSTS MITIGATED WITH THAT TAX CREDIT. SO WITH YOUR ASSISTANCE TO GET RIGHT TO THE THE PUNCH HERE WITH YOUR ASSISTANCE WE CAN HELP REBUILD OUR VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTING EFFORTS. SO ON BEHALF OF SHASTA COUNTY ON BEHALF OF RC RC. AND AS OF A FORMER FIRE BOARD MEMBER MYSELF AND THE FIREFIGHTERS THAT I AM PROUD TO HAVE REPRESENTED WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU OTHER IN SUPPORT. AND OPPOSITION. KENNY. GREAT. WHICH FLOOR THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. AND TO THE OTHER MEMBERS THE BODY IN THE COMMITTEE ON MANY RURAL PARTS OF STATE INCLUDING MY DISTRICT THERE ARE. SOME. STATIONS AND ENGINES MANNED BY ONE PERSON. AND WITHOUT THE VOLUNTEER FORCE THAT COMES. IN PLAYED A ASSIST THOSE FIREFIGHTERS YOU WILL HAVE A SINGLE FIREFIGHTER SHOW UP WITH AN ENGINE. A TWO WAY. ACCIDENT OR A FIRE CERTAINLY. WITHOUT THE ABILITY RESOURCES TO. TO DEAL WITH THAT SO I APPRECIATE THOSE VOLUNTEERS ARE OUT THERE WANT TO SAY. PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGMENT THANK YOU FOR THE WORK THAT THEY DO IN THIS SEEMS LIKE A SMALL A TOKEN OF GRATITUDE THE STATE COULD. COULD GIVE BACK. DOCTOR QUIRK. YES IT'S A THIS IS A TAX CREDIT IF A PERSON DIDN'T OWE ANY TAX WOULD DAY GET. TOM MONEY BACK ANYWAY. IF THEY DID NOT OWE ANY TAX YEAH. TO SAY IT'S A RETIRED PERSON THEY HAPPEN NOT HAVE EARNINGS. NOW EXIT QUE. FIRST OF ALL I'M VERY MUCH APPRECIATIVE THAT YOU MADE THIS A CREDIT AS OPPOSED TO REDUCTION. DIFFICULTY WITH DEDUCTIONS IS THAT ONLY THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY GET A BENEFIT. THOE WHO PAY TEN OR TWELVE PERCENT. AND THE TYPICAL PERSON WHO PAYS TO WERE THREE PERCENT GETS ALMOST NOTHING SO I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE WAY OF STRUCTURED THIS. I KNOW STAFF HERE IN THE CHAIR OF FACT YOU TO TAKE A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS. AND. I'D LIKE TO KNOW. WHAT DOES AMENDMENTS ARE THAT WHALER WON'T BE TAKEN? RATING GUESS WHERE I AM SO IT'S SHORTENED THE CREDIT WINDOW TO FIVE YEARS AND SEVEN NINE. OKAY. CLARIFIED THAT THE CREDIT ONLY APPLIES TO QUALIFIED FIREFIGHTERS IN CALIFORNIA. OKAY. I IT LOWERS THE CREDIT PERCENTAGE FOR THE PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS TO THIRTY FIVE PERCENT THE PERCENTAGE REMAINS THE SAME FOR VOLUNTEERS SO WE WILL BURGER HAVING A HIGHER CREDIT TO THE THOSE WHO VOLUNTEER THAN THOSE ARE WHO ARE PROFOUND QUE SO IT'S THE SAME. SO. IN MY CITY WHERE THERE ONLY PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS THEY COULD GET THAT IS THERE A GOOD. DEFINITION OF WHAT TRAINING IS. ARE GOOD DEFINITIONAL TRANCE. I MEANWHILE THERE'S A WHEN IT COMES TO TRAINING IN THE FIRE SERVICE THERE'S MANY SCOPES WHICH THE FIRE SERVICE TRAINS AND A LOT OF THOSE WE HAVE A TRAINING OFFICER THAT TO PUT TOGETHER'S TRAINEES FOR. VARIOUS IN THE STATE MANDATES HOW MANY HOURS WE GOTTA PUT INTO PARTICULAR TRAINING AND THAT'S THAT'S MANDATED BY THE STATE. SO YES THERE IS A DEFINITION ISSUE IT WOULD JUST BE STATE MANDATED TRAINING IS THAT CORRECT. WELL YES AND NO I MEAN I THINK THIS STATE THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT. AREAS THE STATE TRAINING CAN BE TAKEN INTO WHEN IT COMES TO EMS TRAIN MERGE THE MEDICAL SERVICE TRAIN THERE'S A AT THE VAST AREA. SO THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT INDIVIDUAL DEPARTMENTS LIKE IN OUR AREA WE HAVE A LOT OF MASSIVE AND. FREEWAYS SO WE DO A LOT OF AUTO EDUCATION SO WE TEND TO FOCUS HEAVILY ON THAT AS OPPOSED TO A STRUCTURE FIRE FIGHTING BECAUSE THAT'S OUR BREAD AND BUTTER. NAM. WELL WHAT I'M ALRIGHT SO WHERE DID IF WOULDN'T INCLUDE EMS TRAINING ABSOLUTELY OKAY. WOULD INCLUDE TRANSPORTATION TO AND FROM TRAINING. I WOULD SAY NO. OKAY. BOB WELL PERHAPS YOU CAN JUST CHECK AND AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S FOR SURE LIMITED IF YOU LOOK AT THE ANALYSIS ON A. ON PAGE FIVE IT SHE WROTE GOES THROUGH WHAT NEEDS TO BE CLARIFIED WHAT EQUIPMENT LIKE TRAINING SO THE AUTHOR WILL WORK ON THAT. IN THE NEXT CAN ONLY OKAY FINE.

THIRTY ONE TWENTY EIGHT THANK YOU MADAM FIVE EIGHT. I APOLOGIZE. AGAIN LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT SOMETHING OVER COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. AB THREE WANT TO A WOULD PROVIDE A TAX CREDIT FOR DISABLED VETERANS TO HELP OFFSET THE COST OF OWNING A SERVICE ANIMAL. VETERANS FACE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES WHEN THEY RE ENTRY CIVILIAN LIFE WHY CAN THE STRUCTURE AND DISCIPLINE THAT BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO THE MILITARY. OFTENTIMES A RETURN HOME FEELING DISCONNECTED EVEN FROM CLOSE FRIENDS AND FAMILY. ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS ESTIMATE TWENTY TWO VETERANS COMMIT SUICIDE EVERYDAY. ONE POWERFUL TWO WE HAVE TO COMBAT THE SUICIDE RATE AMONG VETERANS. IS THE HEALING POWER OF SERVICE ANIMALS. DESCRIBED AS BEING LIFESAVERS FOR VETERANS SUFFERING FROM EMOTIONAL PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISABILITIES. SERVICE ANIMALS PROVIDE ASSISTANCE IN A VARIETY OF CAPACITIES FROM SOMETHING ENDANGERS OPEN DOOR. TO SOMETHING MORE SERIOUS A SUMMING ASSISTANCE IN A MEDICAL EMERGENCY. RECOGNIZING THE POSITIVE IMPACT SERVICE ANIMALS MAKE ON THE LIVES OF MILITARY VETERANS. SERVICE SEVERAL NON PROFITS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY HAVE FORMED TO CONNECT VETERANS WITH SERVICE ANIMALS. UNFORTUNATELY IT'S COST ME A BURDENSOME MILITARY VETERANS MANY OF WHOM STRUGGLE TO FIND EMPLOYMENT WHEN THEY GET OUT OF SERVICE. I AM JOINED TODAY BY ONE OF THESE NON PROFITS HERE WITH ME TO TESTIFY IS KEVIN CAMERON FROM ALPHA CANINE. CAMERON. MEDICARE COMMITTEE. ONES CAN CAN ON THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF OFF CANINE.

I'M ALSO LPC SEE I TRAUMA THERAPIST CURRENTLY SPECIALISING ANALISIS THERAPIES. I'M ALSO THIRTY YEAR MILITARY DECORATED COMBAT THAT MY JOB IN THE US ARMY WAS IS A MILITARY WORKING DOG HAMMERING KILLMASTER. THE IF YOU SEE A AS OF THIS YEAR ESTIMATES ACOSTA PET OWNERSHIP SPECIFICALLY FOR A DOG TO BE BETWEEN SEVENTEEN HUNDRED AND TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR. AS FOR TYPICAL HOUSE PET. SERVICE DOGS INCURRING EVEN GREATER COST. UNLIKE BASIC HOUSE PETS THE SURGEON WAS COSTLY BEING WORK AND OFTEN REQUIRES ADDITIONAL MEDICAL CARE HIGHER QUALITY FOOD EXTRA GEAR AND EQUIPMENT TO ALLOW FOR INCLEMENT WEATHER AND TO ENSURE THE HEALTH WILL BE IN THE ANIMAL. THESE COSTS. DO NOT INCLUDE THE EQUIPMENT THE CANINE AND THEY HAVE THEIR NEED NOR THE COST THE ANIMAL ITSELF. THE NATIONAL AVERAGE STEVEN TINA WHEN THESE DOGS CAN BE IN EXCESS OF THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. NO LEASE COST THE CITY WITH THE ANIMALS ARE COVERED BY INSURANCE IS. UPON TO INCLUDE THE CANE AND THE TRAINING AND EQUIPMENT MORE CARE THE ANIMAL. THIS BILL ADDRESS WE POSITIVELY IMPACT ALLEGED MANY EVER WANTED SERVICE MEMBERS AND OTHERS RECORDING SERVICE ANIMALS IN ORDER TO FUNCTION THE WORLD THEY PUT THEIR LIVES ON TO PROTECT. MANY PEOPLE LIVE ON FIXED INCOMES DUE TO THEIR DISABILITIES AND OFTEN HAVE LIMITED ABILITY TO WORK. IN A SITUATION WHERE DISABILITY REQUIRES A PERSON TO LIVE WITHIN A LIMITED MEANS. ANY TYPE OF FINANCIAL BREAKS OF THIS TYPE CAN WE LEAD TO A DRASTIC IMPROVEMENT ON THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE. GENTLY MEDICAL DEVICES OF. AND MEDICALLY NECESSARY EQUIPMENT ARE COVERED. BY INSURANCES AS WELL AS TAX CREDITS SERVICE DOGS CURRENTLY ARE NOT THIS BILL WOULD BE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION PROVIDE ANY FINANCIAL QUALITY BETWEEN. OTHER MEDICAL DISABILITIES AND THOSE WHO REQUIRE THE USE OF SERVICE. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

CURRENTLY IN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED ON THIS MEASURE ON OUR LARGEST CONCERN WE DON'T OPPOSE THE CONCEPT ITSELF CERTAINLY IS THAT ULTIMATELY THE INTENDED BENEFICIARIES WOULD NOT BENEFIT FROM THE BILL AS IT'S IN PRINT. CERTAINLY CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION HAS LONG HAD A POSITION THAT DIRECT EXPENDITURES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY PREFERABLE TO A TAX EXPENDITURE BUT I BELIEVE THERE WERE A COUPLE RECOMMENDATIONS MADE. ON EVEN IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS BOTH IN REGARDS TO. WHETHER THEY SHOULD BE A NON REFUNDABLE OR REFUNDABLE CREDIT GET CREDIT EXCUSE ME. VERSES ENSURING THAT AND THERE WAS SOME SORT OF AGGREGATE AMOUNT OR CAP PLEASED ON.

IF THE DUTY ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY MEMBER IS ON DIRECT ORDERS FROM THE MILITARY FOR CONSECUTIVE NINETY DAYS OR LONGER. THE PAY THAT THE EARNED WHILE OUT OF STATE WILL BE EXEMPT. FROM CALIFORNIA STATE INCOME TAXES. CURRENTLY MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY WHO ARE NOT DEPLOYED TO COMBAT ZONE ARE NOT EXEMPT FROM INCOME TAX. WHERE AS IF THEY ARE IN COMBAT SO THEY WOULD GET A TAX EXEMPTION? THE MEMBERS ARE SENT TO OTHER AREAS OF THE WORLD ARE STILL PERFORMING THE DUTIES TO PROTECT OUR COUNTRY.

UNDER EXISTING STATE AND FEDERAL LAW TAXPAYERS ARE PROVIDED THE OPTION TO CLAIM THE STANDARD DEDUCTION OR TO ITEMIZE THEIR DEDUCTIONS. EXISTING STATE LAW ALLOWS THE DIRECTION OF UNION DUES AND INITIATION FEES ONLY FOR FILERS WHO ITEMIZE TO THE EXTENT THAT A FILERS MISCELLANEOUS ITEMIZED DEDUCTIONS EXCEED TWO PERCENT OF THEIR ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME. AGAIN OR POINT OUT THIS BENEFIT IS PROVIDED ONLY TO TAXPAYERS WHO DO NOT CLAIM THE STANDARD DEDUCTION AND WHO INSTEAD CHOOSE TO ITEMIZE DEDUCTIONS. PREVIOUS IRS DATA ILLUSTRATES THE TAXPAYERS AND HIGHER INCOMES ARE MORE LIKELY TO ITEMIZE DEDUCTIONS. THOSE WITH LOWER INCOMES ARE MORE LIKELY TO OPT FOR THE STANDARD DEDUCTION. SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF HOUSEHOLDS WITH INCOMES BETWEEN A HUNDRED THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ITEMIZED DEDUCTIONS. NINETY THREE PERCENT OF THOSE HOUSEHOLDS WITH INCOMES OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. CONVERSELY ONLY TWENTY ONE PERCENT OF HOUSEHOLDS WITH INCOMES BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FIFTY THOUSAND ITEMIZED DEDUCTIONS THAT'S ONLY ABOUT ONE IN FIVE MEMBERS. ALLOWING INDIVIDUALS TO DEDUCT FROM HIS OR HER GROSS INCOME THE AMOUNT OF MONEY PAID TO MEMBERSHIP DUES TO LABOR ORGANIZATION. WILL BOTH REDUCE THE TAX BURDEN FACED BY LOWER AND MIDDLE INCOME TAXPAYERS WHO DO NOT ITEMIZE THEIR RETURNS. AND INSURE THAT ALL TAXPAYERS RECEIVE ECRU BENEFITS FOR THE SAME ON REIMBURSABLE EMPLOYMENT ACTIVITIES.

WE DID IT KATE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIR MATT BROWN. FROM BROWNING GUSMAN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE TEAMSTERS EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD LONG CHARM AND. UTILITY WORKERS ENGINEERS SCIENTISTS OF CALIFORNIA AND I OF P. T. LOCAL TWENTY ONE WE SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. COMMENSURATE RYAN SHERMAN WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION ONE SPORT AS WELL. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M STEPHANIE DOUBT ALOG WITH THE FACULTY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHAT WE ARE BOARD DOES NOT YET HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THIS BUT. BILL WE THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION HAVE. AND WE DO SUPPORT AYE VOTE. WITNESSES OPPOSITION. QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. NETWORK. YEAH MY PROBLEM WITH THIS YEAR'S. SOMEBODY WHO WORKS IN A HOTEL. AS YOU MAY WELL GETS THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR WILL GET VIRTUALLY NO. ADVANTAGE FROM THIS SOMEBODY WORKS FOR A HIGH TECH COMPANY LIKE I DID AND MAKES A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND A YEAR. NASA SPOUSE TO MAKE SOMETHING SIMILAR WILL GATHER TWELVE TEN OR TWELVE PERCENT BENEFIT. I JUST DON'T THINK THIS IS FAIR SO I'D BUY WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING IT. I'M NOT SURE YOU'VE READ THE BILL AND FUNNY MISTER QUIRK FOUND. THIS ACTUALLY. CURRENT LAW HAS A. DISTORTION EFFECT IN THE MANNER YOU DESCRIBED. AS I SAID IN MY COMMENTS. INCOMES THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND EIGHTY PERCENT OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS CURRENTLY TAKE THIS. UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM IT'S ONLY THE LOWER INCOME FOLKS ONE FACTOR. NOT GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE SOME TAX BENEFIT FOR THE EXACT SAME A YOU KNOW EMPLOYMENT EXPENSE ACTUALLY IS NOT THE CASE BECAUSE HE'S MISCELLANEOUS DEDUCTIONS CAN ONLY BE USED. IF THERE SOMETHING LIKE I'VE FORGOTTEN THE NUMBER BUT IT'S AROUND TEN PERCENT OF THE INCOME SO VERY FEW PEOPLE END UP TAKING THAT AND HIGH INCOME PEOPLE EVEN LESS OUR. SINCE THE UNION DO SEEM TO BE SIMILAR KNOW THE DIFFICULTY I HAVE IS INSTEAD OF A TAX CREDIT. YOU'RE GIVING A DEDUCTION IN INCOME. ALRIGHT SO IF YOU HAVE MAKING THIRTY THOUSAND A YEAR. AND YOU'RE PAYING A COUPLE PERCENT. YOU BET AND YOU PAID A THOUSAND DOLLARS IN DUES YOU'RE GETTING TWENTY DOLLARS BACK. IF YOU'RE MAKING THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND A YEAR. AND YOU SUBTRACT FROM THE INCOME YOU GET TWELVE PERCENT BACK. OR A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS SO THAT MEANS A LOW INCOME PERSON IS GETTING THE TWENTY DOLLAR BENEFIT. HIGH INCOME PERSON GETS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY. NEVER TAX CREDIT I COULD UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S FINE. THEN YOU'RE GIVING EVERYBODY THE SAME AMOUNT BUT IT WHEN IT'S IT DEDUCTION FROM INCOME. COULD THE AMOUNT YOU GET DEPENDS UPON WHAT THE PERCENT YOU'RE PAYING IN TAXES IS AND THAT'S JUST MUCH HIGHER FOR HIGH INCOME INDIVIDUALS. WE HAVE A PROGRESSIVE TAX. AS WE SHOULD AND YOU'RE YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT LESS PROGRESSIVE BY GIVING PEOPLE BREAKS TO OF HIGH INCOME SO YOUR ARGUMENT IS BETTER TO KEEP THE TWENTY DOLLARS AND GOVERNMENT'S POCKET THEN HANDED BACK TO THE LOAN COUNT I WOULD I WOULD SUPPORT A TAX CREDIT. FOR CERTAIN AMOUNT BUT I CAN'T THINK A CORD A YEAH A CHANGE IN IN THAT DEDUCTIONS OR FROM INCOME. I COULD SUPPORT A TAX CREDIT BECAUSE THEN EVERYBODY COULD PRESUMABLY GET THE SAME AMOUNT. YOU WOULDN'T BE GIVING SIX SERVE FIVE OR SIX TIMES AS MUCH TO WEALTHY PEOPLE IS TO POOR PEOPLE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THANK ALL OF ON ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK AT IS THAT SOMETHING YOU WOULD CONSIDER FOR THE FUTURE OR IF YOU HAVE YOU. THAT SOME YOU THOUGHT THROUGH AND AND THINK THAT IT'S CLEAR THE WAY IT IS I THINK I'M CERTAINLY OPEN TO THEM. MY POINT IS WHERE EVERYBODY OUGHT TO RECEIVE SOME BENEFIT FROM AYE SOME POINT EXPENSES AND UNDER CURRENT LAW THAT DOESN'T OCCUR. A MISSED APPROACH POINT SEEMS TO BE IT DOESN'T OCCUR IN THIS BILL TO THE EXTENT IT LIKE. I SEE IT. ALTHOUGH AS I UNDERSTOOD EVEN HIS QUESTION THE TAXPAYER STILL BETTER OFF. AFTER THIS BILL PASSED THAN THEY ARE. CURRENTLY I GREW THAT I UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT TWO OKAY THANK YOU MISTER RIGHT. IF YOU WOULD AGREE TO CONSIDER A TAX CREDIT AS OPPOSED TO DEDUCTION FROM INCOME I'D BE WILLING TO VOTE TO GET IT OUT OF THE COMMITTEE NOW AND RESERVE MY VOTE ON THE FLOOR A. WOULD YOU CONSIDER THAT ABSOLUTELY SIR I APPRECIATE THAT THAT CONSIDERATION MY CASH CERTAINLY CONSIDER WORKING WITH YOU TO IMPROVE THE BILL SO THAT WE CAN NOW MAKE THIS MORE EQUITABLE.
