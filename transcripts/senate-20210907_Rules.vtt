00:36:04.362 --> 00:36:05.363
STRENGTHS OF THE COMMUNITY

00:36:05.429 --> 00:36:07.832
COLLEGE SYSTEM IS EXACTLY THAT.

00:36:07.899 --> 00:36:08.933
IT'S EXTRAORDINARY BREADTH AND

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.102
DIVERSITY NO ONE COLLEGE IS

00:36:11.168 --> 00:36:13.337
EXACTLY LIKE THE OTHER YOU KNOW

00:36:13.404 --> 00:36:15.473
WITHIN LA YOU HAVE A COLLEGE

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:16.474

00:36:16.541 --> 00:36:19.577
PROGRAM- YEAH AND YOU KNOW. IT

00:36:19.644 --> 00:36:21.012
IN THE VALUE OF ONE THAT HAS A

00:36:21.078 --> 00:36:22.246
PROGRAM IT'S WORKING WITH TESTS

00:36:22.313 --> 00:36:23.948

00:36:24.015 --> 00:36:25.816
THAT EACH. WHAT'S BEEN REALLY

00:36:25.883 --> 00:36:27.051
WONDERFUL ABOUT THE WAY THE

00:36:27.118 --> 00:36:28.653
SYSTEM WORKS AND SOMETIMES

00:36:28.719 --> 00:36:30.821
CHALLENGING BECAUSE YOU HAVE A

00:36:30.888 --> 00:36:33.257
HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN- PHYSICAL

00:36:33.324 --> 00:36:34.792
ENTITIES THAT ARE SERVING VERY

00:36:34.859 --> 00:36:35.927
DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES IN VERY

00:36:35.993 --> 00:36:37.562
DIFFERENT NEEDS BUT- THE WAY

00:36:37.628 --> 00:36:39.030
THE SYSTEM IS STRUCTURED. IT

00:36:39.096 --> 00:36:41.365

SERVE THE SPECIFIC COMMUNITY IN

00:36:49.473 --> 00:36:51.042
WHICH THEY SET AND I THINK THAT

00:36:51.108 --> 00:36:54.912
IS A REAL STRENGTH- AND SO EACH

00:36:54.979 --> 00:36:55.479
ONE OF THEM HAS A BLUEPRINT

00:36:55.546 --> 00:36:58.516
THAT LOOKS. DIFFERENT AND EACH

00:36:58.583 --> 00:36:59.083
ONE OF THEM HAS A BLUEPRINT

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:01.085
THAT SERVICE. DIFFERENT NEEDS

00:37:01.152 --> 00:37:03.120
AND SO I THINK THAT STRENGTHENS

00:37:03.187 --> 00:37:05.323
THE SYSTEM OVERALL IT MAY. ON

00:37:05.389 --> 00:37:07.959
