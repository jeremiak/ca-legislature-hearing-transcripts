SO IN TERMS OF THE HEARING WE WILL BEGIN WITH A PRESENTATION BY OUR HEALTHCARE SERVICES WE WILL THEN FOLLOW THAT. WITH COMMENTS FROM OUR STAKEHOLDER PANEL. ACTIVES AND THEN WE WILL- THEN TAKE A MEMBER QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS AFTER THAT AND- AND- HERE ANSWERS FROM OUR- DISPENSE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS HEARING IS BECAUSE OF THE PART OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS PROPOSING A DIRECT STATEWIDE CONTRACT WITH KAISER PERMANENTE A TO PROVIDE HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO MEDICARE RECIPIENTS. EARLY SERVICE ALMOST NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEDICARE RECIPIENTS WITH EITHER THE PRIMARY HEALTH CARE. I AM VERY HEALTHCARE SERVICES PLAN IN SOME COUNTIES FORCES SUBCONTRACTED HEALTHCARE SERVICES PLAN AND A NUMBER OF OTHER COUNTIES. KAISER IS NOT OPEN TO ALL MEDICAID ENROLLEES BUT TO THOSE WHO RECENTLY HAD KAISER WHO HAD IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS IN KAISER. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ALSO OPEN KAISER TO FOSTER AND FORMER FOSTER YOUTH AND PEOPLE ARE DULY ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICARE. GLAZER WOULD ALSO ACCEPT SOME NEW COULD BEEN RELEASED THROUGH THE FAULT ROMAN AS LONG AS KAISER DOES NOT EXCEED A PROPOSED 25% GROWTH IN MEDICAL AND ROWLEY'S. THE PART OF HEALTHCARE SERVICES IS PROPOSING TO MAKE THESE CHANGES THROUGH A BUDGET TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. AN AGENCY GUIDANCE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA IS AUTHORING ABC TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY FOUR AS A POLICY VEHICLE FOR THIS PROPOSAL. THE PURPOSE OF TODAY'S HEARING IS TO EXAMINE THIS PROPOSAL WE ARE NOT FORMALLY HEARING THAT BUILT TODAY BUT WE ARE HEARING THE PROPOSAL. FIRST AND FOREMOST IS THIS PROPOSAL IN THE BEST INTEREST OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. FOR MORE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES HAVE ACCESS TO BETTER QUALITY CARE OR MERIT MEDICAL PROVIDERS. SECONDLY SHOULD KAISER BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY THAN OTHER MEDICARE MANAGED ARE PLANS REQUIRED TO ENROLL ANY MEDIC CAL THE FISHERY THAT USES OUR PLAN OR WHO MAY WISH TO RESTRICT OUR NETWORK TO ONLY CERTAIN HIGH QUALITY PROVIDERS. IN ADDITION TO KAISER WOULD BE THE SOLE STATEWIDE- HEALTH PLAN CONTRACTED HEALTH PLANS FOR US OTHER HEALTH PLANS UP. WOULD BE CONTRACTING FOR EITHER A COUNTY OR GROUP OF COUNTIES. THIRD WHAT KAISER HAVE ADEQUATE LOCAL RELATIONSHIPS TO ENSURE THAT MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE CONNECTED TO OTHER SERVICES IN THE THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND DOES THIS CHANGE THE UNIQUE MODEL OF. COUNTY ORGANIZE HEALTH SYSTEMS WERE MEDIC CAL IS PROVIDED THROUGH A SINGLE PLAN IN A COUNTY OR A GROUP OF COUNTIES. FINALLY WILL BOTH KAISER AND OTHER MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLAN RATES ACTUALLY COMPENSATE PLANS FOR THE COST OF PROVIDING CARE TO MEDICARE RECIPIENTS. PARTICULARLY IF THERE'S A DIFFERENCE IN CASE MIX IN THE BENEFICIARIES WHO ARE SIGNED UP FOR EACH PARTICULAR PLAN. WILL THAT BE REFLECTED IN RATES SO THAT THERE IS FAIRNESS AND PAYMENT. SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT- HOPEFULLY WILL BE ADDRESSED- IN THE PRESENTATIONS AND THAT WILL BE FOUGHT THAT- THE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMITTEE BE FOLLOWING UP ON. AND WITH THAT I WOULD NOW LIKE TO INVITE CENTER EGGMAN- CHAIR OF THE SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE- BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES BUT- THAT. THE CHAIR OF THE TICKET BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES TO GIVE HER OPENING REMARKS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DR PAN IT'S NCE TO BE HERE TODAY TO SEE HERE THIS IMPORTANT ITEM. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT A LOT WITH THE WITH THE BUDGET. A SUB COMMITTEE WE HAVE WHEN WE WHEN WE MET WITH THE DIRECTOR BASS WE'VE MET WITH KAISER WE MET WITH- THE DEPARTMENT- AND THE IN THE ADMINISTRATION IN A LOT OF THIS BUT WE THINK IT IS IMPORTANT. TO PUT AS MUCH DAYLIGHT ON THIS AS WE POSSIBLY CAN WE KNOW A LOT OF FOLKS HAVE KAISER AND OUR- AND ENJOY THEIR PLANS AND WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO KEEP IT AND WE ALSO UNDERSTAND- ARE BLOOD THE- OTHER LOCAL PLANS- FEELINGS THAT. THAT THEY MAY NOT ALWAYS BE TREATED. LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT KAISER IS BOTH A PROVIDER AS WELL AS A PLAN. WHICH PUTS THEM IN A UNIQUE CATEGORY- SO WE WANNA YOU KNOW WE WANT RESPECT AND HONOR THAT SO I'M GLAD TO BE HERE TODAY I'M GLAD WE'RE GOING TO BE- MY COLLEAGUES WILL BE ABLE TO ASK MORE QUESTIONS AND WILL BE ABLE TO THINK ABOUT OUR OWN. ON TO MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIANS GET THE BEST BENEFITS POSSIBLE THANK. THANK YOU SO MUCH CARE EGGMAN ORDER. OTHER MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE WHICH TO MAKE AN OPENING COMMENT BEFORE THE END. AS SAYING NONE- WILL FIRST BEGIN WITH THE PRESENTATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES. A DIRECTOR BASS THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY- OF. WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR PRESENTATION WELCOME. AFTERNOON THANK YOU AYE CHAIRS AND MEMBERS OF THE OF THE COMMITTEE AND SUB COMMITTEE I REALLY THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THIS PROPOSAL. WE ARE PROPOSING IN BUDGET TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO DIRECTLY CONTRACT WITH KAISER AS A MEDIC CAL MANAGED CARE PLAN STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND THIRTY TWO COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE. WE CAME TO THIS PROPOSAL WITH THE GOAL OF IMPROVING THE EXPERIENCE FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES WE WANT OUR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES TO EXPERIENCE LESS DISRUPTION IN CARE AND MORE ACCESS TO QUALITY PROVIDERS AND WE THINK THIS PROPOSAL DOES THIS. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE ARE GETTING IS WHY SHOULD DH CS TREAT KAISER DIFFERENTLY. AS ALLUDED TO EARLIER KAISER IS DIFFERENT FROM OUR MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PLANS IN THAT IT'S AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM IS BOTH A PLAN AND A PROVIDER. AND RELIES ON ITS BRICK AND MORTAR FACILITIES TO PROVIDE CARE. KAISER DOES NOT EXPAND ITS NETWORK BY CONTRACTING OUT WITH PHYSICIAN GROUPS FOR EXAMPLE LIKE OTHER MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PLANS. THEY'RE INTEGRATED AND SELF CONTAINED SYSTEM IS UNIQUE. BECAUSE OF THIS KAISER HAS NOT BEEN SUBJECT TO THE TRADITIONAL MEDICAL PLAN CHOICE METHODS WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE GENERAL EVERYONE WHO SELECTS KAISER. THE ENROLLMENT ROADWAYS WOULD FAR OUTPACE ITS PHYSICAL CAPACITY. KAISER IS ALSO UNIQUE BECAUSE IT'S SYSTEM INCLUDES ACCESS TO THE SAME PROVIDERS FOR THEIR COMMERCIAL MEDICARE EXCHANGE A MEDIC CAL POPULATION. THERE IS A HIGH QUALITY PROVIDER KAISER CONSISTENTLY SCORES ABOVE 90% IN OUR AGGREGATED QUALITY FACTOR SCORES WHICH IS A QUALITY SCORE THAT ACCOUNTS FOR PLANT PERFORMANCE IN COMPARISON THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF OTHER MANAGED CARE PLANS IS ABOUT 65% ADDITIONALLY KAISER SCORES HIGHER ON INDIVIDUAL FACTORS RELATED TO CHILDREN PREVENTIVE CARE AND MATERNAL CARE. KAISER IS THE HIGHEST AMONG THE HIGHS FOR QUALITY SCORES FOR FOLLOW UP CARE FOR CHILDREN PRESCRIBED ADHD C. MEDICINE- DEPRESSANT MEDICATION MANAGEMENT CONTRACEPTIVE CARE TIMELINESS A PRENATAL CARE RESIDENTS ARTICLE CANCER SCREENING AS WELL AS CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZATION STATUS FOR EXAMPLE. WE WANT TO GROW THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE MEDICAL SPACE UNDER THIS PROPOSAL THEY WILL GROW MEDICARE ENROLLMENT 25% OVER THE FIVE YEAR CONTRACT THIS EQUATES TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW MEMBERS OVER FIVE YEARS ACROSS THE THIRTY TWO COUNTIES. THIS MEANS THAT THEIR MEDICAL GROWTH WILL BE AT A FASTER RATE THAN IT'S PROJECTED GROWTH FOR COMMERCIAL AND MEDICARE THIS MEANS THAT MORE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THIS HIGH QUALITY PLAYER. THIS INCREASING CAPACITY TO SERVE ADDITIONAL MEMBERS WOULD OCCUR NOT QUITE KINDS ARE CONTRACTING OUT WITH PHYSICIAN GROUPS ARE CLINICS. RATHER THIS INCREASING CAPACITY WOULD OCCUR BY KAISER HIRING MORE CLINICIANS TO WORK IN THEIR CLOTHES INTEGRATED LOCATIONS ENTERPRISE ABILITY NOT NEW FACILITIES. HI THERE WILL NOT BE SHIFTY ACCESS AWAY FROM OUR SAFETY NET PROVIDERS THEY WILL BE ADDING CAPACITY INTO THEIR INTEGRATED SYSTEMS AND WE WILL MONITOR THIS TO OUR NETWORK CERTIFICATION PROCESS. NEW KAISER ENROLLEES WILL GET YOU SEE KAISER DOCTORS THIS IS BEING MISREPRESENTED SO WHY BE VERY CLEAR ON THIS. ADDITIONALLY THIS PER. THE MEDICAL PROGRAM IS GETTING MORE FROM KAISER UNDER THE CURRENT ARRANGEMENT TODAY. THIS IS BETTER THAN THE STATUS QUO FOR OUR BENEFICIARIES M. PROGRAM. TODAY KAISER IS ALLOWED CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS FROM PLAN REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS EXEMPTIONS FROM FACILITY SITE REVIEWS AND MEDICAL RECORD REVIEW PROCESSES. UNDER THIS PROPOSAL THESE TYPES OF EXEMPTIONS WOULD NO LONGER APPLY. WOULD BE SUBJECT TO ALL OF THE SAME REQUIREMENTS AS ARE OTHER MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PLANS. TODAY HI SUSAN ROMAN IS ONLY THROUGH CONTINUITY AND FAMILY LINKAGE THAT IS A PERSON IS ABLE TO SELECT KAISER AS THEIR MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PLAN IF IN THE LAST SIX TO TWELVE MONTHS THEY HAD HISER. SO FOR EXAMPLE IF A PERSON HAS EMPLOYER SPONSORED KAISER AND LOSES THEIR JOB THEY COULD SELECT KAISER AS THEIR MEDICAL PLAN. UNDER OUR PROPOSAL IN ADDITION TO CONTINUITY AND FAMILY LINKAGE THEIR ENROLLMENT WILL GROW BY AUDI DAHLE ELIGIBLES THOSE ELIGIBLE FOR BOTH MEDICARE AND MEDI CAL I'M INDIVIDUALS WITH GENERALLY HIGH COMPLEX. NEEDS AND CONDITIONS SO FAR PERSON SELECTS KAISER FOR THEIR MEDICARE THEIR MEDICARE ENROLLMENT IN KAISER WOULD BE ALIGNED PURSUANT TO STATE LAW. AND ANOTHER OPTION IS FOR OUR FOSTER YOUTH WE KNOW THAT ARE OFTEN OUR FOSTER YOUTH MOVE ACROSS COUNTY LINES AS PLACEMENTS CHANGE. THIS WOULD PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY FOR FOSTER YOUTH HEALTH INFORMATION TO SEAMLESSLY TRANSFER POSITION ACROSS COUNTY LINES SO THERE PROVIDERS HAVE THEIR HEALTH RECORDS FROM ANY DUPLICATE IMMUNIZATIONS. AND ENSURING THAT IMPORTANT INFORMATION INFORMATION SUCH AS HISTORY OF ALLERGIC REACTION TO MEDICATION MOVES WITH THE USE. THESE OPTIONS ARE ALL BASED. ON CHOICE OF THE BENEFICIARY. AND YOU THE FEET ON OUR ORIGINAL PROPOSAL THAT THIS ALLOWS OR TWO JERRY PICK WE'VE EXPANDED OUR PROPOSAL TO ALSO INCLUDE GROWTH FROM A RANDOM MIX OF MEMBERS THROUGH THE DEFAULT ENROLLMENT PROCESS. THIS IS WHEN WE ASSIGN A PLAN TO AN INDIVIDUAL IF THE PERSON DOES NOT SELECTED PAN AYE AND DURING THE ENROLLMENT PROCESS. WE WILL WORK WITH KAISER ON DETERMINING THIS DEFAULT NUMBER PER COUNTY BASED ON THEIR CAPACITY TO PROVIDE HERE IN EACH COUNTY. VERY IMPORTANTLY IN ALL OF THESE PATHS OF ENROLLMENT KAISER WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO DECIDE THE NIGHT OR DISCONTINUE A MEMBER. I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT KAISER'S CASE MIX IS RELATIVELY REFLECTIVE OF THE STATEWIDE CASE MIX. FOR EXAMPLE THEY HAVE ABOUT THREE POINT SEVEN SIX- SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AND THE STATE WHY NUMBERS ARE AT THREE POINT FOUR FIVE PERCENT. ADDITIONALLY I WOULD NOTE THAT IN SACRAMENTO AND SAN DIEGO WHERE WE HAVE A DIRECT CONTRACT WITH KAISER. KAISER'S MEMBERSHIP IS PROJECTED TO BE HIGHER RISK THAN THE COUNTY AVERAGE FOR CHILD AND ADULT POPULATIONS AT LOWER RISK FOR SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. TO THE MARK I DIRECT INSIGHT INTO WE HAVE TO KAISER THE MORE WE'RE ABLE TO AFFORD THESE TYPES OF ANALYSIS. TODAY HI A PARTISAN. IN CAL TWENTY TWO CARRY. THE DEPARTMENT DIRECTLY CONTRACTS WITH KAISER IN FIVE COUNTIES AND KAISER PARTICIPATES IN THIS AS A SUBCONTRACTOR WITH TWELVE LOCAL PLANS IN SEVENTEEN COUNTIES. UNDER THIS PROPOSAL KAISER WOULD PARTICIPATE IN THIRTY TWO COUNTIES AND IN SOME OF THESE COUNTIES THE PARTICIPATION WOULD BE BASED ON THE ZIP CODES WHERE THEY MAINTAIN A NIGHT LIGHT KNOCKS KING LICENSE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE. AND THIS WOULD BE IN IN THOSE COUNTIES WHERE THEY HAVE ANY LINE OF BUSINESS AND IN ALL INSTANCES KAISER WOULD DIRECTLY CONTRACT WITH THE STATE. THIS IS BRINGING ADDITIONAL ACCESS AND CAPACITY FOR THE MEDICAL PROGRAM IN TEN COUNTIES. THIS PROPOSAL GIVES THE STATE DIRECT OVERSIGHT OF KAISER AND A THIRTY TWO COUNTIES AND ALLOWS US TO PUSH KAISER'S AND WAYS WE HAVE NOT DONE BEFORE AS WE WILL HAVE A DIRECT OVERSIGHT- AND KIND OF DIRECT CLARITY AND TRANSPARENCY WITH REGARD TO OUR AND PROVISION OF OVERSIGHT. THIS IS A STEP FORWARD IN THE PAST THE SIMPLE IN THE STATE AS IT REDUCES I'M NAY I NEEDED LAYERS OF ADMINISTRATION AND BUREAUCRACY BY ELIMINATING THE TWELVE SUBCONTRACTS AND COURSE BY NEED ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD BETWEEN KAISER AND OTHER MANAGED CARE PLANS. ELIMINATING CONSUMER CAN VIEW REGARDING SOME CON. OR ARRANGED BETWEEN KAISER AND THE OTHER MANAGED CARE PLANS. AND AGAIN ALLOWS DH CS TO HAVE DIRECT OVERSIGHT OF. THE CARE OF ABOUT A COSTA MILLION BENEFICIARIES. TODAY HI THERE IS NOT REQUIRED TO PARTNER WITH COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS FOR EFFORTS RELATED TO POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT ECON SALT- INPATIENT SPECIALTY ACCESS. UNDER THIS PROPOSAL KIZER HAS AGREED TO TERMS ON THESE PARTNERSHIPS IN PARTICULAR WE ARE GETTING THEM TO PARTNER WITH FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS ARE NON KAISER MEMBERS TO ADD SPECIALLY ACCESS CAPACITY THEY DO NOT DO THIS TODAY. ONE OF OUR GOALS IS SEEK TO CREATE IS TO SEEK TO CREATE PARTNERSHIPS THAT PROVIDE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES THE MOST POSSIBLE AND WE HINK PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN OUR FAQS AND KAISER. ON SPECIALTY CARE IS AN EXTRAORDINARY OPPORTUNITY THIS IS GETTING THE DID YOU HAVE TO DO MORE EMBEDDED CAL EVEN FOR NON KAISER MEMBERS. I KNOW THERE ARE QUESTIONS RELATED TO HELP PLAN RATES AND HOW THEY WILL BE A TRUSTED TO ACCOUNT FOR BE IT AT THE ACTUAL ACUITY RISK. OF EACH PAGE HI AND AGREEMENT TO ENSURE VERY IN PAY. CAP RATES WILL COUNT MEMBERS SHOULD MEMBERSHIP SHIPS TO THIS. THE WILL DRAW THE PLAN SIX. TO REMOVE MEMBERS WORK LOW SO TO ACCEPT. TO KAISER AS WELL AS THE GLOBAL SUB CAPITATION COSTS FOR THESE MEMBERS. WHAT MEMBERS WHO ARE SUBJUGATED KAISER ARE REMOVED FROM THAT DIRECT PLANS ENROLLMENT. THIS CAPITATION COSTS REVIEWS MEMBERS WILL BE REMOVED AS WELL. IN OTHER WORDS WE WILL REMOVE THE COST FOR KAISER AS A DELEGATE AND NOT ASSUME THAT THE TRANSITIONING KAISER MEMBERS COSTS THE SAME AS THE DIRECT PLANS AVERAGE NUMBER. CONSEQUENTLY THE RATES WILL RECOGNIZE THE SHIFT A MEMBER AND MEMBER MIX AND COSTS. JUST FOR BACKGROUND CAPITATION RATES ARE DEVELOPED TO BE SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE REASONABLE APPROPRIATE AND ATTAINABLE PROJECTED COST OF PROVIDING COVERED SERVICES TO ALL POPULATIONS DURING THE RATING PERIOD. RADIAN IS RATE SETTING IS INFORM THE- PRIMARILY BY HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ADJUSTED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE APPROPRIATE POPULATIONS AND SERVICES. DURING THE DURING THE RATING PERIOD. I CAPITATION RATES ARE FURTHER SEPT TO HEALTH BASED RE ADJUST PROCESS. WHICH IS A PROCESS USED TO REMEMBER OUR PLANTS BASED ON HEALTH STATUS OF THE POPULATION. WE ALSO HEARD THE CONCERN THAT PLANS WOULD HAVE TO WAIT TWO YEARS TO RECOGNIZE THIS ADJUSTMENT TO THE RATES. LOCAL PLANS WILL NOT NEED TO WAIT TWO YEARS TO WRITE RECOGNIZE THIS ADJUSTMENT AS JUST NOTED THE RATES ARE DEVELOPED ACCOUNT FOR THESE CHANGES PRIOR TO THE START OF THE RATE YEAR. WE ALSO THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR KAISER TO MAINTAIN AND BUILD LOCAL RELATIONSHIPS. TO ENSURE THAT THEIR MEDICARE MEMBERS ARE CONNECTED TO ALL THE SERVICES THEY NEED IN THE COMMUNITY- THAT'S REQUIRED BY CALTRAIN. AND AS REQUIRED BY JUST OUR GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF THE SOCIAL DRIVERS OF HEALTH REALLY RECOGNIZING THEIR VALUE ON HEALTH OUTCOMES. KAISER IS COMMITTED TO USING COUNTY DEPARTMENTS PUBLIC HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS AND COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS TO DELIVER OUR CAL AIM ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT BENEFIT AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT SUPPORTS. KAISER HAS ALSO COMMITTED TO BROUGHT UP TATE OF COMMUNITY SUPPORTS CONSISTENT WITH OTHER MEDICARE MANAGED CARE. MANAGED CARE PLANS WILL IMPLEMENT AT LEAST THE SAME NUMBER OF COMMUNITY SUPPORTS AS OTHER PLANS IN THE AREA. ADDITIONALLY WE THINK ALL OF OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS COMMERCIAL KAISER AND LOCAL PLANS SHOULD BUILD OUT THE RELATIONSHIPS WITH COUNTY DEPARTMENTS AND LOCAL PARTNERS. AS SUCH OUR NEW MANAGED CARE CONTRACT TO GET A PLACE TO ALL OF OUR PLANS AND GOES LACKS TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. INCLUDES REQUIREMENTS FOR PLANS TO HAVE MO USE WITH COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENTS CHILD WELFARE PROBATION CONTINUES OF CARE AREA AGENCIES ON AGING FOR EXAMPLE. PLANS WILL BE REQUIRED TO FACILITATE WARM HAND OFFS AND CLOSED LOOP REFERRALS OF MEMBERS TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY RESOURCES. THESE M. O. USY OUTLINED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES BETWEEN THE PARTIES REGARDING SCREENS. CLOSE LOOK REFERRALS COORDINATION DATA EXCHANGE DISPUTE RESOLUTION MEETING FREQUENCY QUALITY IMPROVEMENT ACTIVITIES FOR EXAMPLES. LOCAL ENGAGEMENT IS A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE BEYOND THIS PROPOSAL THAT THE DEPARTMENT RECOGNIZES IS CRITICAL IN ADDRESSING THE SOCIAL DRIVERS OF HEALTH AND DELIVERING SERVICES OUTSIDE OF TRADITIONAL HEALTH CARE SETTINGS. THIS APPLIES NOT JUST TO KAISER. BUT TO ALL OF OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS. QUESTIONS HAVE ALSO BEEN REYES REGARDING COMMITMENT BE ABLE SERVICES AND COLLABORATION WITH COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. UNDER THIS PROPOSAL WE WILL HAVE DIRECT OVERSIGHT AND INSIGHT INTO KAISER'S PROVISION OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. CURRENTLY THIS INSIGHT IS INCORRECT AND MOSTLY VIA THE PRIME PLANS THIS DIRECT RELATIONSHIP WILL IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE ACCOUNTABLE. ADDITIONALLY WE KNOW THAT ALL OF OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS CAN DO BETTER WITH REGARD TO THE PROVISION OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES ONE OF THE TOP THREE CLINICAL FOCUSES IN OUR NEW COMPREHENSIVE QUALITY STRATEGY IS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTEGRATION. WE KNOW THAT ADDRESSING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TODAY WILL REDUCE CHRONIC DISEASES AND SERIOUS ILLNESSES IN THE DECADES TO COME AND FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER WE ARE INCLUDING METRICS RELATED TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SPECIALTY SERVICES AS PART OF OUR QUALITY STRATEGY. IN CLOSING THIS PROPOSAL GETS AS MORE FOR OUR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES DOING NOTHING IS WORSE THAN THE STATUS QUO. WE WANT TO GROW ACCESS TO QUALITY PROVIDERS FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES AND THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CRAFT DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO WORK WITH KAISER DIFFERENT PARTNERSHIPS TO EXPAND THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO THE MEDICAL PROGRAM. AGAIN OUR GOAL IS TO PROVIDE CHOICE AND CONTINUITY FOR OUR MEDIC HEALTH BENEFICIARIES ACROSS PAYER SOURCE ACROSS COUNTY LINES TO INCREASE ACCESS TO SERVICES AND QUALITY CARE. THIS PROPOSAL BRING SIGNIFICANT VALUE TO OUR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES THANK YOU EFFECT INCLUDE A PRESENTATION FOR THE PART HEALTHCARE SERVICES THEN- I WILL MOVE ON TO OUR STAKEHOLDER PERSPECTIVES AND THEN AFTER THAT WE WILL HAVE OUR- WILL HAVE QUESTIONS FROM COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. SO THE NEXT SPEAKER- LEADING OFFICE STAKEHOLDER PERSPECTIVES IS A REEF- SHAKE BELIEVE HOPEFULLY LIKE OF A PRONOUNCE IT CORRECTLY HIS DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA MEDICAID OUT AND STATE SPONSORED PROGRAMS AT KAISER PERMANENTE. WELCOME THANK YOU- DOCTOR CAN A GOOD AFTERNOON SENATORS MANY MISS ARCHIE AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA MEDIC KALLEN C. SPONSORED PROGRAMS HERE BECAUSE- I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO MENTION THAT I'M CHOI. BY DOC BECAUSE SHE WAS IT'S OR CHIEF I CRIED. IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BETTER AND ALSO THE OF. MENTAL IN THIS. BECAUSE SHE WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE ROCK SERVICES OKAY I HAVE ON BEHALF OF KAISER PERMAN. I AM TO SHOW OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE ADMINISTRATION BUDGET PROPOSAL TO ENTER INTO A SINGLE. DIRECT MEDI CAL CONTRACT WITH KAISER PERMANENTE A STARTING JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. HI COMMITTEE HAS PROBABLY DISSIPATED MEDICARE FOR YEARS AS A NONPROFIT HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATION WITH THE MISSION TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY CARE ENCOURAGING TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITIES. HI COMMITTEE CURRENTLY PROVIDES HIGH QUALITY CARE-HIS DIRECTOR BOSS MENTIONED TO OVER NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES IN TWENTY TWO COUNTIES FOURTEEN CONTRACTS LOCAL PLANS AND GMC COUNTIES. A SINGLE DIRECT CONTRACT ALLOWS KAISER PERMANENTE DE TO INCREASE ITS PARTICIPATION IN MEDICARE WITH MANAGEABLE GROWTH THAT WOULD IMPROVE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ACCESS TO CRITICAL PROVIDERS AND QUALITY HEALTHCARE SERVICES WITHOUT NEGATIVELY IMPACTING THE ESSENTIAL ROLES OF THE LOCAL HEALTH PLANS AND. SIGNAL PROVIDERS. TRANSITIONING INTO A DRAW MEDI CAL CON TO SEE YOU HELLO EQUITY HI PERMANENTE A WILL. MORE INVOLVED POPULAR. WITH NEEDS SO AS FOSTER. TO MEDICARE THE MEDICARE SENIOR IN OTHER LOW INCOME. IT INCREASE ACCESS QUALITY CARE HI IS A PERMANENT AS BY TO IS HIGH QUALITY RATED THE ACCOUNT PLAN. HAS PERMANENTLY WILL ALSO EXPAND ITS MEDICAID A MOMENT TO TEN AND DIGITAL COUNTIES FOR A TOTAL OF THIRTY TWO COUNTIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THIS ALLOWS CRISIS COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO KEEP THEIR SAME DOCTORS THERAPISTS HOSPITALS ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS ETCETERA NO MATTER WHAT COUNTY RESIDING RATHER THAN HAVING TO NAVIGATE A WHOLE NEW SYSTEM OF HEALTH CARE AN ALREADY STRESSFUL TIMES IN THEIR LIVES. IT REDUCES IMAGE COMPLEXITY INCREASES STATE OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT. A DIRECT CONTRACT WILL REMOVE ADMINISTRATIVE LAYERS MAKING THE MEDICARE PROGRAM EASIER TO ACCESS FOR MEMBERS AND WILL STREAMLINE THE STATE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE CONTRACT. AND FINALLY T RESPECTS LOCAL CONTROL HI COMMITTEE WILL HAVE NO USE WITH COUNTIES AND WILL COLLABORATE WITH LOCAL HEALTH PLANS COUNTIES AND THE SAFETY NET I'M DETERMINING IN ROMAN GROWTH IMPLEMENTATION OF CALLING BECAUSE HE'S AND DELIVERY OF COMMUNITY SUPPORTS. THIS PROPOSAL IS A CAREFULLY BALANCED APPROACH THAT WILL ALLOW KAISER PERMANENTE A TO INCREASE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY CARE. FOR A BROADER NUMBER OF MEDICAL ISSUES IN A WAY THAT IS INTENDED TO COMPLEMENT LOCAL HEALTH PLANS AND SEEKING A DELIVERY SYSTEM. WE LIKE TO THINK YOU'RE A DOCTOR PATTEN SENATOR EGGMAN YOU'RE TOO MANY STAFF. HOLINESS INFORMATIONAL HEARING FOR THE BACKGROUND INFORMATION THAT WAS PROVIDED. DURING IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE EXTENSIVE PUBLIC DISCUSSION THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE. ON THIS PROPOSAL OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH MANY STAKEHOLDERS AND LONGTIME PARTNERS ACROSS THE STATE ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INTEREST IN THIS PROPOSAL AND WE VALUE YOUR INPUT. WE WELCOME FURTHER CONVERSATION AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS AS PROPOSAL MOVES FORWARD. AGAIN DOCTOR BECAUSE SHE AND I ARE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE HAVE.

THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK TODAY AND FOR THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANT PROPOSAL. I MONEY COMMITTEE OVER THE LOCAL HELP AND THE CALIFORNIA. GP REPRESENTS SIXTEEN CANYON BASED LOCAL PLANS THE STATE WHICH- FOR OVER PERCENT OF MY- AND CARE AND. HE HAS THEY ARE. TO THE- FOR EACH AND INTO WIDE HOW COME. THE TIGER. NOW IN EARLY FEBRUARY. CITING THINKING IN FOR THE NOT HELPFULLY AS AND I. CONSEQUENCE THAT NOT AND BY THE ADMINISTRATION. AND PUBLIC.

IN MEETING NEEDS OF LOCAL MEDIC HOW BENEFITS YOU. FOR DECADES. I WILL THREE KEY CAN. DELIVER CARE LOCALLY AND SUPPORT THE THINKING AT. BEST MODEL EXPANDED OVER THE SUBSEQUENT DECADES AND IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THERE WILL BE A PUBLIC PLAN AND FORTY NINE COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE. IN EACH OF THESE COUNTIES LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS WENT THROUGH A PUBLIC PROCESS WHICH CULMINATED IN THE PASSAGE OF COUNTY ORDINANCE SAYS. THE DALLAS OR JOIN A PUBLIC LAND. I FOUNDATIONAL PART OF THE LOCAL PLAN MODEL IS THAT LOCAL PLANS AND THEIR STAFF ARE LOCATED IN THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. I HAVE LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND GOVERNANCE. THE CONNECTION TO COUNTY PROVIDERS AND THE COMMUNITY CANNOT BE REPLICATED BY IMPOSING REQUIREMENTS TO ESTABLISH. RELATIONSHIPS THEIR GRIEVANCE. THE PROPOSAL FOR A JACK DIRECT STATEWIDE CONTACT IS PRETTY. PROUD FOR MEDIC CAL AND RELEASED- BY COUNTY ORGANIZED HEALTH SYSTEMS. ARE THERE IS ONE PUBLIC PLAN THAT COVERS ALL MEDICAL MANAGED CARE ENROLLEES. BECAUSE THERE IS A SINGLE ENTITY ORGANIZING CARE THERE IS A UNIQUE ENVIRONMENT OF COLLABORATION AMONG PROVIDERS HOW MANY. AS A RESULT. HAVE BEEN LEADER IN MEDIC HOW PILE INNOVATIVE NEW PROGRAMS ANY INTEGRATING. THEY HAVE LONG SO THAT ARE NEW LEADING CARD OTHER PLANS ALLEN. HAS BEEN A BIG IN.

ACCESS THE SAME KIND OF PROVIDERS THAT ARE SERVING I DO COMMERCIALLY. ENROLLEES THE FACT THAT QUE CONTRA NINE PROVIDERS PARTICULARLY FOR PRIMARY CARE THIRD. IT'S NOT A CALENDAR WE ARE NOT GETTING ACCESS TO CLOTHES NETWORK WHICH IS THE BASIS FOR THIS PROPOSAL. ADDITIONALLY IF EITHER CONTACTED COMMUNITY CLINICS OR OTHER MEDICAL PROVIDERS IN THE COMMUNITY IT IS NOT CREATING NEW ACCESS FOR MEDICARE MEMBERS. IN ASSEMBLY REDUCING ACCESS FOR NON PAY THEIR MEDICAL AND RELIEF. I KNOW DIRECTOR ROSTERS TO THIS ISSUE AND INDICATED HI THERE WILL NOT IN FACT CONTRACTED OUT TO THIRD IN MEMBERS HOWEVER. WITHOUT STATUTORY PROTECTION WE DO NOT BELIEVE HE HAS THE IN FOR A THIRTY. PERCENT COURSE THAT. FINALLY THE IN ROMAN RULED OUT IN THE- ARE BY DEATH. EXCLUSIONARY I DIDN'T.

THIS IS A NATIONAL FOR MEDICARE MEMBERS INCREASE LOPSIDED ENROLLMENT BETWEEN NINETY MANAGED PLAN. AND COUNTY WERE LOW PLANT TO PRESENT TODAY FIRST POP. AND THE OTHER PLAN THEIR CAP. THIS IS ALL TRUE LOCAL THAT THE CATER. DIFFERENT HAS IN. FOR MEDICARE PROVIDER AND THEN. SPEAKING AT PROVIDERS WHICH SOMETIME CAN HIDE THAN HALF OF LOCAL FANS I AM RIGHT NOW.

JENNIFER THEY BELIEVE THE AT ABOUT LINE AND I CAN. MUST BE A IN FACT YOU. WE PROVIDED SUPPOSE THE NUMBER THAT IF THAT NECESSARY PART. AND OPEN DISCUSSION WITH A LOT. ABOUT EARLY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY PATTERSON FOR THIS VICE PRESIDENT CALIFORNIA CARE ASSOCIATION WELCOME. RIGHT YOU SO MUCH. BYE THANK YOU MISS CHAIR MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF BOTH- AS DOC BEEN DISTORTED MY NAME IS ANNE MARTINE PATTER AND I'M THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION AND THEIR AFFILIATE CALIFORNIA HEALTH ADVOCATES. CBSA REPRESENTS MORE THAN THIRTEEN HUNDRED COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA THE PROVIDE HIGH COMPREHENSIVE HIGH QUALITY CARE TO SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION PEOPLE. RESHAPE THE DIALOGUE SPURRED BY THIS PROPOSAL ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS HERE TODAY ARE COMMITTED TO CREATING A MEDICAL PROGRAM THAT DELIVERS ROBUST SERVICES WITH EXCELLENT QUALITY. BUT WE HAVE NOT TAKEN AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE ADMINISTRATION'S TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE OR THE BILL THAT HAS BEEN INTRODUCED IN THE ASSEMBLY WE DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL THAT WE ASK THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. THE GREATEST RACE WE SEE FROM THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ATS PETE IS INADVERTENTLY CREATING A TWO TIERED MEDIC CAL PROGRAMS. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS NOT THE INTENT OR IS ABOUT OF THE MEDICAL PROGRAM BUT WITHOUT CAREFUL CONSIDERATION IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SUCH A PROPOSAL WILL DESTABILIZE THE LARGER MEDICAL PROGRAM. AND UNDERMINE THE ORIGINAL INTENTIONS. WHAT KINDS ARE PERMANENT IS NOT EXPRESSLY MENTIONED IN THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE WE KNOW THAT THEIR THE PLAN TARGETED BY THIS PROPOSAL. KP HAS LONG BEEN A PARTNER TO MEDICARE ALLEN CBC AND HEALTH CENTERS WE RESPECT AND ADMIRE THEM. BUT WE ALSO HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN THAT THEIR CORPORATE AND FINANCIAL STRUCTURE ENABLES THEM TO UNFAIRLY COMPETE WAS PRINCIPALLY THE SHOWS UP IN WORKFORCE. COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS HAVE FOR YEARS STRUGGLE TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE STAFFING STRUCTURES WE SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES KP DOES TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN PROVIDERS. THEIR COMMERCIAL LINES OF BUSINESS PROVIDE A REVENUE SOURCE THAT NONPROFIT HEALTH CENTERS DON'T HAVE. I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES I'VE HEARD STORIES LIKE THIS ONE WE JUST FINISHED TRAINING A NEW TEAM ABOUT MAYES LAST YEAR IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS TEN OF THEM WERE ALL HIRED BY KP. OR I'VE PROVIDER JUST FINISHED HER RESIDENCY IN KP OFFERED HER A TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR SIGNING BONUS AND ALL WE COULD OFFER WAS TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND. THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME ALL UP AND DOWN THE STATE. AND WE IN NO WAY BEGRUDGE KP FOR INVESTING IN THEIR WORKFORCE THEY HAVE EXCELLENT PROVIDERS AND STAFF. OUR CONCERN IS THAT WE HAVE NO VIABLE MECHANISM TO KEEP UP AND THUS ARE LEFT CONSTANTLY UNDERSTAFFED THE CONSEQUENCE OF THIS IS A TWO TIERED MEDICAL DELIVERY SYSTEM. IF YOU MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES CAN RECEIVE COMMERCIALLY SUBSIDIZED INSURANCE AND CARE WHILE THE RESTAURANT A SYSTEM NOT BY DEFAULT NOT BENEFITTED FROM COMMERCIAL INVESTMENT. THE LEGISLATURE CAN HELP US SOLVE THIS CONUNDRUM. ALL OF US HERE WANT MEDIC HELL TO BE THE BEST HEALTH INSURANCE FOR ALL RECIPIENTS ACROSS THE STATE NO MATTER WHERE THEY LIVE. WE DON'T WANT THAT FOR JUST A FEW. HOW CENTERS HAVE INVESTED DECADES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES WITH OVER THIRTEEN HUNDRED SITES ACROSS THE STATE A MULTITUDE OF SERVICES PRIMARY CARE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. DENTAL OPTOMETRY ACUPUNCTURE WE HAVE BUILT TRUST WITH OVER SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE WE HAVE ALL OF THIS IN PART BECAUSE OF OUR UNIQUE PAYMENT MODEL IN PPS BUT ALSO. IN SPITE PPS. UBS RATE SIX. CANNOT BE RAY WILL COME FOR SO. INCREASES WE HAVE AN INFLATION INDEX KNOWN AS MEDICARE ECONOMIC INDEX BUT IT'S BETWEEN. SOMETIMES A CLOSE 2022% A YEAR AND MANY HEALTH CENTERS WILL TELL YOU THEIR RATES ARE AT LEAST 20% OUT OF LINE WITH MARKET SALARIES. IF THE LEGISLATURE CAN HELP US ADDRESS THIS MATTER THAN HEALTH CENTERS CAN BE STRENGTHENED AND WE CAN LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD. WE CAN HELP TO ENSURE IN EVERY CORNER OF THE STATE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES HAVE ACCESS TO EXCELLENT QUALITY CARE. FULLY STAFFED BY EXPERT PROVIDERS AND STAFF. WE ALSO HAVE A FEW LOGISTICAL ISSUES OF CONCERN. TO RAISE MORE GENERALLY. WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT NETWORK DISRUPTIONS BY KP GROWTH WE DO NOT WANT TO SEE THE 25% GROWTH CAP OVER FIVE YEARS. DO ANY UNDUE HARM IN ANY ONE COMMUNITY. THE KP SERVICE AREA IS UNLIKELY TO BE HARMFUL. TO THE HEALTH CENTER DELIVERY SYSTEM BUT IF A DISPROPORTION ABOUT OCCURRED IN ANYONE ZIP CODE IT COULD INADVERTENTLY TO STABILIZE THE HEALTH CENTER. WITH A LONG HISTORICAL PRESENCE. TO MITIGATE BEST WE DO BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE AN ADVISORY BODY CLOSELY MONITORING THE GROWTH. AND THAT SUCH A BODY SHOULD INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE HOUSE. THIS IS PARTICULARLY A CONCERN FOR THE ZIP CODES AND COUNTIES WERE KP DOESN'T ALREADY OFFER MEDICAL. LASSEN REGARDS TO SPECIALTY CARE ACCESS WHICH WE APPRECIATE BEING A COMPONENT OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE AUTHOR'S INTENT. WE WANT TO SAY THAT WE ABSOLUTELY NEED MORE ACCESS TO SPECIALTY CARE AND WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE A MORE CONCERTED EFFORT AND WILLINGNESS FROM CAPE K<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; TO LEAN IN HERE.&lt;/c&gt;</u> THAT SAID WE KNOW THAT KEEP YOU CANNOT BE THE ANSWER STATEWIDE BOTH BECAUSE OF THEIR STAFFING GEOGRAPHIC LIMITATIONS. FURTHERMORE WE KNOW SPECIALTY ACCESS IS COMPLICATED HENCE WHY IT HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR SO LONG. AS PART OF OUR WORK WITH THE STATE AND KAISER I'M POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT ONE OF THE AREAS OF FOCUS ON THAT WE'VE BEEN GETTING UNDERNEATH IS pWANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE'S BEEN A DEEP AMOUNT OF WORK IN DATA. THAT HAS GONE INTO THIS AT THAT POINT WE ARE NOT PREPARED TO OFFER SOLUTIONS AS WE BELIEVE THAT WORK BUT WE BELIEVE THAT WORK SHOULD CONTINUE IN EARNEST- AND FIND THE BEST SOLUTIONS. WE WANT WE JUST NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO GET IT RIGHT- BUT ARE INVESTED TO BE SAID IN OUR HELP AND OUR MEMBERS. OF THE CONTINUING THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND FINDING AN APPROPRIATE SOLUTION KAISER IN THE STATE ALL DESIRE A STRONGER QUALITY ORIENTED MEDICAL PROGRAM. FOR THAT TO HAPPEN THE LEGISLATURE IN THE STATE MUST CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE PROVISIONS. PUT FORWARD IT BY THE ADMINISTRATION AND BY THE AUTHOR TO ENSURE ALL THE REQUIREMENTS FOR PLANS AND PROVIDERS IN MEDIC CAL. ARE EQUAL AND FAIR AND THAT BENEFICIARIES. HAVE A WONDERFUL COMPREHENSIVE QUALITY ORIENTED EXPERIENCE ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND FAILURE LAST STAKEHOLDER FOR- AND OUR PANEL IS HAS A TAURUS- CASOULOS UP ALL SEAMLESSLY ADVOCATE FOR HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA WELCOME CHARTER MEMBERS CAN EVERYONE HEAR ME. YES PLEASE BEGIN THANK YOU OR IS WITHOUT TAXES CALIFORNIA STATEWIDE HEALTH CARE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION HEALTH ACCESS HOUSING SUPPORT IF AMENDED POSITION ON THE DIRECT CONTRACTING PROPOSAL WITH KAISER PERMANENTE BEING HEARD IN TODAY'S INFORMATION HEARING THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AS MENTIONED ALREADY INTENDS TO ENTER INTO A DIRECT CONTRACT WITH KAISER AS A MEDICAMENTO PLAN IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OF THE STATE HEALTH ACCESS IS GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE VARIOUS GOALS IN THE PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE PATIENTS AROUND THE STATE WITH CONTINUE YOUR CARE. IF THEY HAD PRIOR COVERAGE WITH KAISER AND NOW BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE. IF THIS WORKS AS INTENDED MORE CALIFORNIA PATIENTS IN MARIN COUNTY'S WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO KEEP THEIR BECAUSE OUR DOCTOR AND NOT HAVE THEIR CARE INTERRUPTED. IT WOULD GIVE PATIENTS MORE OPTIONS AND MAKE EXISTING OPTIONS CLEAR TO THEM. RIGHT NOW EVEN IN COUNTIES WHERE KAISER IS A MINUTE CAL IT'S NOT CLEAR TO PATIENTS WHAT PLAN THEY SHOULD CHOOSE THAT POTENTIALLY HAS A SUBCONTRACT. THAT WOULD ENABLE THEM TO STAY WITH THEIR DOCTOR. WE ALSO SUPPORT EXPANDING THE OPTION OF KAISER COVERAGE TO THE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS OF FOSTER CHILDREN AND TO A LEGIBLE SENIORS. AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. GETTING KAISER TO DO MORE OF ITS FAIR SHARE AND MEDICARE NOW HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE THE CAPACITY AND QUALITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN THIS KEEP PROGRAM. GIVEN THE DOCUMENTED ACCESS ISSUES AND MEDICARE- BRINGING IN KAISER'S NETWORK OF DOCTORS HOSPITALS AND SPECIALISTS SHOULD HELP ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THIS PROGRAM THAT SERVES OVER THIRTEEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS CONTRACT SHOULD ENSURE THAT KAISER'S ADDITIONAL% CAPACITY IS ADDITIVE RATHER THAN REPLACING OR COMPETING WITH CRITICAL SAFETY NET HOSPITALS OR CLINICS. COMPARED WITH MANY OTHER PLANS KAISER DOES RELATIVELY WELL ON MANY QUALITY METRICS SO THAT THEIR EXPANSION IS LIKELY POSITIVE FOR IMPROVING QUALITY AND MEDICARE FIVE. BUT THERE IS STILL MUCH ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT ON THE RECORD QUALITY IN EQUITY ESPECIALLY WITH AND BEHAVIOR HEALTH. A DIRECT CONTRACT BETWEEN DCS AND KAISER WOULD BE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR THE STATE. TO HAVE A GREATER AND MORE DIRECT OVERSIGHT OF KAISER TO BETTER MONITOR ACCESS TO CARE AND ENSURE PATIENT PROTECTIONS. WELL WE SUPPORT THE BROAD INTENT OF THE PROPOSAL WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE INTENDED GOALS AND COMMITMENTS ARE CODIFIED TO BEST BENEFIT MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. AND THAT THERE IS ACCOUNTABILITY WITHIN THIS CONTRACT WITH KAISER AS A MEDICAMENTOS CARE PLAN. WE THINK THE COMMITTEES AND THE DEPARTMENT FOR WORKING WITH US TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS. SEVERAL OF OUR AMENDMENTS SEEK TO CLARIFY AND CODIFY WHAT THE DEPARTMENT IN KAISER HAVE ALREADY PUBLICLY COMMITTED TO. WHICH WOULD PROVIDE GUARANTEES AND ASSURANCES AGAINST MISUNDERSTANDINGS. THE FULL LIST OF OUR AMENDMENTS CAN BE FOUND IN OUR LETTER SUBMITTED TO THIS JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARING. ONE OF OUR BROADER ASK IS THAT WE ENSURE THAT KAISER ENTERED INTO A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH THE COUNTY THEY ARE LOCATED IN. TO BEST COORDINATE THE CARE TO MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. FOR EXAMPLE SOME OF THE WHOLE PERSON CARE GOALS OF COUNTY TEAM OUR BEST FULFILLED BY COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICES AND OTHER COUNTY SERVICES. IN ORDER TO MEET THESE AND OTHER POPULATION HEALTH GOALS WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT KAISER ESTABLISHES A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COUNTY AND RELATED ORGANIZATIONS. TO BETTER CORNY PUBLIC HEALTH. SERVICE IS EXPANSION EARLY. WE SUPPORT THE GREATER KINDLY BACK HOME WITH STATEWIDE. BUT WE THINK THAT IS A TO ME. THE INPUT RELATIONS. THIS IS IMPORTANT GIVEN THAT KAISER COMES TO THIS FROM A DIFFERENT STARTING PLACE THAN THE PUBLIC HEALTH PLANS CREATED BY COUNTIES. FINALLY WE APPRECIATE THAT KAISER WILL TAKE ON MORE OF ITS SHARE OF THE STATE'S MEDICAL PUBLICATION WHILE ALSO GROWING ITS BUSINESS. NO LONGER AS A SUBCONTRACTOR UNDER OTHER PANS TAKING AN ADMINISTRATIVE FEE. IN THIS CONTEXT WE'D URGE KAISER TO COMMIT TO SPECIFIC WAYS. IT WILL INCREASE ITS STATE WIDE AND LOCAL COMMUNITY INVESTMENTS AND IMPROVING MEDIC COW. THE HELP LOW INCOME COMMITTEES AND TO INCLUDE THOSE COMMITMENTS IN STATURE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. WE DO THINK EITHER FOR WORKING WITH US ON A DRESSING OUR CONCERNS AND FINDING A PATH FORWARD IN THIS PROPOSAL. AGAIN CONTACTS CALIFORNIA IS TAKING A SUPPORT OF AMENDED POSITION ON THIS DIRECT CONTRACTING PROPOSAL. ALTHOUGH WE DO HAVE QUESTIONS ON HOW THIS PROPOSAL WAS ORIGINALLY RELEASED. AND THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN THE INITIAL PROCESS WE DO THINK THE CHAIRS AND MEMBERS HERE IN THE STRUCTURE MISSION OF HEARING. FOR WORKING WITH US ON OUR CONCERNS AND DO LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THIS WORK. BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS PROPOSAL BEST BENEFITS MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES AND STATE. THANK YOU. HI THANKS VERY MUCH. WE NOW WITH THOSE PRESENTATIONS WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE- OKAY. THE SERVICE CENTER RUBIO AND THEN- SERA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MADAM CHAIR- WELL WHERE TO BEGIN THERE'S SO MUCH THAT WAS DELIVERED TO US RIGHT NOW SO I'M GONNA TRY TO NOT COMPREHENSIVE WAY- ASK MY QUESTIONS- I WANT TO START WITH- YOU KNOW I HAD MET A FULL DISCLOSURE I HAD MET EARLIER TODAY- WITH THAT MICHELLE BASS AND I HAD HEARD YOU KNOW I HAVE MY QUESTIONS AND- ADEQUATE ANSWERS BUT THEN AS FOR HEARING THE OF THE TESTIMONY. YOU KNOW BROUGHT MORE QUESTIONS UP THE ONE ISSUE THAT I'M HAVING TO CONTEND WITH AND I WANT CLARIFICATION SO I CAN HEAR BOTH SIDES. IS THAT WHEN YOU KNOW I HEAR FROM- FROM THE ADVOCATES. THAT ARE IT'S NOT GOING TO DISADVANTAGED. BY THEIR HEALTH PLANS I'M SORRY OTHER HEALTH CLINICS AND NOT IT'S NOT GONNA TAKE THE SICKEST PATIENTS AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO TRICKLE DOWN TO SUBSTANDARD- YOU KNOW OUR SERVICES BUT THEN. WHEN I HEARD THE LAST PANELISTS AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT WAS- IT COULD HAVE BEEN AND D. R. WHO SET THIS FOR MAYBE A REFER THEY TALKED ABOUT AGAIN THEY'RE GONNA LEAVE US WITH THE SICKEST PATIENTS SO I'M HERE IN THIS CONFLICTING SORT OF TESTIMONY WHERE ONE SAYS NO THE OTHER ONE SAYS YES SO I'D LIKE TO GIVE THEM BOTH THE OPPORTUNITY JUST ON THAT ISSUE. WE CAN CLARIFY BECAUSE I WANT TO HEAR FROM BOTH THAT STANCE AGAIN ONE BELIEVES THAT IT WILL LEAVE THEM WITH THE SICKEST PATIENTS AND THE ANALYSIS NOW I JUST WANT THAT ISSUE SEPARATED AND- AND BROUGHT FORWARD IF THAT'S OKAY. OKAY SO- MAYBE WELL DO IS- AS DIRECTOR FOR US IS- CAN EIGHTY FIRST ADDRESS THAT ISSUE AND THEN AGAIN SENATE RUBIO IF I HAVE THE WRONG PERSON CORRECT ME SO WHOEVER YOU ARE LISTEN TO BUT MAYBE IT WILL HAVE- LIMIT KOOPMANS FROM THE LOCAL HEALTH PLANS AND RESPOND. AND THEN AND IF YOU ALSO WANT THE PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION AS WELL SINCE YOU KNOW NOT JUST SO YOU KNOW OKAY SOMEONE AND FAVOR SOMEONE IN THE APPLICATION SITE SO I JUST WANT TO RECONCILE THOSE TWO STATEMENTS AND IT JUST SEEMS THAT PEOPLE BELIEVE. AND WHEN I HEAR THE TEST YOU MAKES SENSE BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE READING ALL THAT WAS SAID I JUST WANT TO SEPARATE THIS ISSUE AND GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT A VERY AYE PRICES SUGGEST THAT PERHAPS- AND AGAIN IT'S OTHER PEOPLE IN AFTERWARDS BUT WE WILL START OFF WITH THE ACTOR DIRECTOR BOSS FOLLOWED BY. LAMEA KOOPMANS FROM THE LOCAL HEALTH PLANTS IT SO DOCTOR BOSS DO YOU WOULD YOU MIND. TO IT ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE. OR STAY YOU FOR THE QUESTION. SO TODAY. HIS ROOM IS B. ON. ALONE SO WITH PROPOSAL WE ARE AT ACTUAL MORE. MORE HIGHER MEMBERS. BY HAVING THE OPTION OF THE JEWEL ELEGY. WHICH GENERALLY KNOW AND ELDER FOR BOTH MEDICARE AND MEDICAID. AND THEN OUR FOSTER YOUTH AND THEN THROUGH THE DEFAULT ENROLLMENT ASSIGNMENT ALSO A RANDOM MIX OF MEMBERS TO KIND OF REFLECT. THE PROPRIETY OF A CUTIE THAT MIGHT BE REFLECTIVE. OF THE MEDICARE POPULATION SO IN PARTICULAR IN COMPARISON TODAY ACTING KAISER WILL BE GETTING A MORE RANDOM A MORE. DIVERSE MIX OF MEMBERS- COMPARED TO WHAT HEY HAVE. TODAY AND I JUST DIDN'T REALLY. ALL UP ON OF THE POINT ABOUT WE- CAN. PLANS DO GET PAID BE ON THEIR QUEUE THE MIX THE WORD EXPECT PLAN TO DO MORE WITH LESS. IT HAVE IT HIGHER GDP. AND SO JUST I THINK THOSE TWO ARE VERY CRITICAL IN TERMS. THAT HOW THIS FOR IS THAT A BETTER INTER OF MEN MAKES VOICE AT HIGHS ARE. SO NOW WE CAN HAVE THE OPPOSITE RESP TO THIS. YES YES HAVE A- KHOO. FROM THE LOOKS HEALTH PLANS. YEAH ADD MONEY TO MEN'S AND ACTUALLY LET ME GET TO THE REPEAT I'M GOING TO INTRODUCE MY COLLEAGUE JENNIFER LOPEZ TO THEIR DIRECTOR POPPED AND FINANCING BUT- TO START WITH RESPONDING TO THE QUESTION ABOUT. THE SO. I THINK FIRST STARTING WITH THE ENROLLMENT RULES. SHE KNOWS THAT MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. WHO HAVE NOT HAD PREVIOUS INVOLVEMENT THROUGH CONTINUITY OF CARE. THAT WOULD RUN HOUSES- WHO RE ENTERING FROM THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WILL NOT QUALIFY TO ENROLL IN KAISER. I THINK IT STARTS THERE AND THEN BASED ON CURRENT ENROLLMENT- IT WOULD NOTED EARLIER THAT TWELVE OUR LOCAL PLAN SUBCONTRACTED WRITER TODAY. SO WE'RE ABLE TO SEE WHAT SHE REALLY LOOKS LIKE BETWEEN OUR DIRECT NUMBERS AND THOSE THAT ARE ASSIGNED HI THERE. AND SO ON AVERAGE OUR OUR DIRECT NUMBERS WERE SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES ARE THOSE BETTER SURVIVE HEY THERE. OF COURSE IT IS VERY SCANTY TO COUNTY BUT THERE WE HAVE NOT SEEN SOUND LIKE HE THERE'S- FOR OUR DIRECT NUMBER ARE. TO ONE HUNDRED AND TEN PER. MORE EXCUSE THANK HATERS NEVER SHIPPED. IN HER OF THE GNU POPPY. HAS TO BE WITH WITH THE- ALTHOUGH THEY ARE A MARBLE POPULATION. AND THEIR COSTS AND THEY'RE CARED REALLY FOR ON THE- SIDE NOW ON THE MEDICARE SIDE BUT THERE'S A THE THING AND PART OF THE THINGS THERE- AND WITH FOX YOUTH THERE IN OF SOCIAL AND THE HEALTH NEEDS NOT NOT THE- YOU KNOW FROM A MEDICAL- NEED FIRST AS- AND THEN FINALLY ON FOURTH BEFORE IT DENTIST TO THE RATE ISSUES- THAT WERE REFERENCE. DESIGN VETO AND FINE. I THINK WE DON'T HAVE THE DETAIL I MIGHT BE IN THE NEXT THAT FOR. I YOU KNOW WE BEEN HOLE THAT IT ACTUALLY BE. I THINK OF. SMALL AMOUNT. OF THEIR OF CARE MEMBER SO DON'T THINK IT WILL ACTUALLY ACTUALLY CHANGE THE NEXT MEMBERS HEY THERE WILL BE- BUT AGAIN. THERE'S NO DETAIL THAT THAN FOR THE UNTIL THE POINT. SO IT YOU DON'T MIND AND ME INTRODUCING LOPEZ AND HER THOUGHT THE ROOF ISSUES THAT WOULD GREAT YES. PLEASE PLEASE WE ARE ON. GET OUT. HIGH LOW WITH LOCAL HEALTH PLAN. WELL WE DON'T GET. PLAN GET PAID ON A CHEERLEADING. NEAREST IS THE CURRENT RATE CRACK. PRACTICE DO NOT ACCURATELY AND JUST FOR ME. SHEILA E. FIFTY. MEMBER DURING THE HELP. MM WHO ARE THE HIGH NEED OUR ISSUE IS NOT THE OP. OF BRICK CONTROL. WERE OUT. WHAT MEANS. FOR THIRD HIGHER. OF HEALTHY MEMBERS THEY- WITH THESE KIND OF FLY RISK OUT. RECEIVE ON IN. BUT FIRST. HELPING MEMBERS WELL PLAN WHO ARE LAST THIRTEEN THE MORE HIGHER. MEMBERS OR- GET AND- HANDLED AND REYES ATTY. WE FEEL THE BITE. OF THE IN RAW X. OUTLINED THE KAISER. I'M IN THE END HI WILL SERVE. HEALTH MEMBERS AND IF RISK JETS OUTPUT ARE NOT CORRECT IT HI THERE WILL INDEED RECEIVE AN UNINTENDED. FOR SERVING HOW. MEDICARE MA'AM WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE A- IN THE- THREE IN THE MOST FRAIL. OUR IN THAT REQUIREMENTS THE RATE FOR. ARE TO ENSURE PLAN ARE PAID. RATE I THE PROPOSAL BEFORE. THANK YOU WELL CLEARLY THERE IS SOME TWO MESSINA BELIEVE- THEY MENTION THAT THEY HAVE AN GONE EVERYTHING THAT THAT THEY NEEDS TO EXPLORE THE FULL IN ROME. AND THE DETAILS SO I GUESS WE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET THEY- SO WE CAN. ACCEPT IT FURTHER BUT YEAH I WANT TO MOVE ON TO ANOTHER ISSUE- IT WORRY ME. IS ACTUALLY RUBIO- CAN I PUT QUICK PAUSE YOU KNOW MY- I THINK STATURE EGGMAN DID HAVE A FALL TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION SO WE CAN DO THE FALL UP IN THOSE ACTIVE. AND SO JUST A DIFFERENCE TO MY FUTURE VACANT I THINK HER UP THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS A JUST DIRECT RELATED SAID I LOSE MY- DENT. NO NO WENT- SO IT'S US SO THAT WE'RE- TO DO. THINGS BECAUSE ONE OF WHEN THE PROPOSED FIRST CAME OUT. THERE WAS A LOT OF CAN. THAT IT WAS. GOING TO. ADVERTISER PEOPLE THERE ALREADY ME THE PIE- TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THIS THIS DEFAULT AS WELL. BE ASSIGNED. BUT PERMITS LIMON I FEEL LIKE I'M TO THINGS. IRMA'S COOPS AND I'M- IT IN A NATIONALLY WASN'T INCLUDED IN THE PLANS WERE SAYING THAT'S TERRIBLE DO YOU HAVE TO INCLUDE. YOU KNOW SOME DEFAULT SO NOW THE PLAN INCLUDES DEFAULT BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE NOW YOU'RE STILL SAYING. IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE DEFAULT AND THE DEFAULT ITSELF WILL FURTHER DESTABILIZE THE PROVIDER NETWORK IS THAT WHAT I'M HEARING. YES LET ME CLARIFY AND I THINK THE CONCERN AGAIN IS THAT THE ENROLLMENT RULES THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE PROPOSAL. WILL MEAN THAT ONLY CERTAIN BENEFICIARIES QUALIFY CAN ROLE IN TIGHTER AND BOTTLES WELL THAT PEOPLE PROPOSAL HAS BEEN SHARED BY THE GAS AT A HIGH LEVEL- WE DON'T HAVE ANY DETAILS IN FORM- EVALUATE HOW WILL ACTUALLY IMPACT THE PROPOSAL. AND- SERVITE HIGH THEIR BIRTH IS JUNE THIRD BY THE LOCAL PLAN AND THINKING THAT PROVIDERS- SO I THINK IT'S A MATTER OF- NEEDING% ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO EVALUATE THAT. AND THEN. ADDITIONALLY QUESTIONS AS TO IF KAISER WAS GOING TO GROW BY 25% OVER A FIVE YEAR CONTRACT FIRM- I TO THE D. PROPOSAL BEING. ANNOUNCED HOW DO THAT HOW DOES THAT GET FACT IN I THINK WE PROBABLY HAVE LOT OF OPEN QUESTION ABOUT WHAT BEING PROPOSED IN THE HOW ACTUALLY IMPACT WILL BE SERVED HI THERE- VERSUS THE OTHER PLANS OKAY THANK YOU AND SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THE DEPARTMENT WOODS AND NEED WORK ON. ON THAT ISSUE AND I WOULD JUST I WOULD JUST MAKE NOTE THAT THE OTHER ISSUE THAT THAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE RATE SETTING FOR QT IS REALLY NOT AS RELATED TO THIS PLAN AS YOUR OVERALL ISSUES WITH. RATE SETTINGS FOR QT. SO THERE IS A DIRECT LINKAGE BETWEEN THIS PROPOSAL AND ARE CONCERNED SO. YOU'RE RIGHT THAT THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE. PROCEED THIS PROPOSAL AND OUR BROADER CONCERNS ABOUT THE RATE SETTING PROPERTY TODAY AND THE FLAWS THAT WE- SEE IN THAT PROCESS. BUT THE PROPOSAL WILL EXACERBATE THOSE ISSUES. BECAUSE IT REMOVES A HEALTHIER SUBSET. OF MEMBERS BEING SERVED BY LOCAL PLANS OR THROUGH KAISER AND BY CATER TO LOCAL PLAN. AND LEAVE LOCAL PLANTS WITH THAT EVEN MORE DISK IT REALLY MEANS THAT WE NEED- GUARDRAILS. IF THAT WAS A PROCESS BY WHICH HE YES ENSURE THAT THE REFACTORED CONSIDERED. ADEQUATELY AND APPROPRIATELY IN THE RESETTING PROCESS. OKAY SO. WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS NOT UNLIKE TO GO AHEAD CENTER- I A N. AND THEN BUT DON'T FOR YOUR THOUGHTS. RIGHT AND OUT THAT ONE GET TO YOU YOU CAN YOU CAN ALWAYS COME TO THE TOP AS WELL OKAY CENTER. YEAH AND THINK YOU- TO MADAM AND WRAPPED UP SEE IT'S VERY TO CONTINUE THE COME. BECAUSE I AM HEARING THAT THE UP BY. THAT NSS AND DON'T ASSIST OPPOSE THE JUST HAVE THE- TO HAVE ITS REALLY HIGH TO GET TAKEN CARE CONGRESS. BECAUSE IT'S A MATTER OF GETTING IN TO SEE IF THEY ACTUALLY OPPOSED ONCE THEY SEE THE DETAILS ALL RIGHT NOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO AT LEAST ME PAS ON THAT ISSUE. BUT ANOTHER QUESTION THAT I HAD JUST INITIALLY WAS. GIVEN THAT WE'RE HEARING FROM JUST EVERY INDUSTRY HOW OTHERS WORK FOR SHORTAGES HOW ARE YOU GONNA. FILL THE SEAT HELD A POSITION SAID THERE'S AN INFLUX OF ENROLLEES BUT THEN. OUR IS- SOMEWHAT SADDENED WITH WHAT I HEARD IN TERMS OF HOW THESE OTHER FACILITIES TRAIN PEOPLE AND THEN THEY END UP LEAVING AND- THEN EVEN COMPETING WITH- SIGNING BONUSES AND- AND I THINK THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT DOES GIVE ME GREAT PAUSE BECAUSE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT AS- THEY- FACED AT THAT. TO TEACH MEDICAL SYSTEM. WE WHEN THERE ARE RECRUITING. TOP NOTCH. AND GIVING THESE YOU KNOW BIG BONUSES. THEY ARE TAKING QUALITY PROVIDERS AWAY FROM THE SMALLER FACILITIES AND I THINK THAT SOMEWHERE IN THERE WE HAVE TO EXPLORE THE ABILITY TO MAYBE. CAPS IN ABILITY TO THE TO RECOUP FROM. THESE FACILITIES AT. PERSONNEL AND NOW THEY LOSE IT IS THAT CAN MORE IN I THINK THAT WE AS A- OR TO THAT. IF WE ALLOW THE TO MOVE THE WAY. AT IT IS. I'D LIKE I WOULD TO SEE. IN THERE ARE A LEAST CONTINUE TO COME. ON DO WE- LEVEL THE PLAYING FOR WHETHER IT BE. CAPPING SOME KIND OF RECRUITMENT. YOU KNOW DOLLARS SO THAT YOU KNOW SMALLER FACILITIES CAN ALSO COMPETE IN TERMS OF QUALITY. YOU KNOW PERSONALITIES NOT WE ARE CREATING THIS TO SYSTEM OR THEY MAY HAVE THE- THE- BETTER QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS IN THE SMALLER FACILITIES ARE BEING ARE LEFT WITHOUT. WELL THAT THEY KEEP TRACK AND SO ALSO. SOMETHING THAT I'D LIKE TO SEE EXPLORE I GET I DON'T HAVE THE SOLUTIONS BUT I REALLY JUST WANT TO PUT IT OUT THERE THAT IS A CONCERN FOR ME. AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT EXPLORED A LITTLE FURTHER THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER RUBIO- MAYBE A QUICK COMMENT ON THAT WOULD BE AS WE RAISE MEDI CAL RATES MAYBE. FACILITIES THAT TAKE CARE OF MAJORITY MEDI CAL PATIENTS COULD BE MORE COMPETITIVE IN HIRING BUT- WHAT WILL EXPLORE THAT LATER. SO WE'LL GO CENTER ROCKS AND THEN- FOLLOWED BY OKAY AGAINST LIMO ACCIDENTS OUT LEYVA HAVE MY QUESTIONS. OKAY CENTER ROTH. IS TO TRY TO GET A GROUP OF THE CHURCH NOT CAPPING THE RECRUIT. IT'S PUTTING. FUN INTO THE MEDIC- SO THAT THE- RATE TO RING. AND SO THE- THAT. PROVIDE MEDICAL SERVICES HAVE THE MONEY NECESSARY TO PAY. AND TO COMPETE WITH THOSE IN THE COMMERCIAL MARKET PLACE WHICH WILL BE DIFFICULT IT'S CERTAINLY. AN ISSUE THAT WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH. SINCE I CAME UP HERE ALMOST TEN YEARS AGO. BUT WITH SOMETHING WE NEED TO PURSUE AND- CENTER RUBIO I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH YOU. I'M TRYING TO. I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AND RECONCILE THE OPPOSITION. WITH THE PROPOSAL. AND WHAT I HEARD FROM. THE DIRECTOR WAS. WITH REGARD TO FQHCS I WAS TOLD THAT ONE OF THE CONCERNS WAS THAT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ALLOW KAISER TO START. BOOKING SLOTS SO TO SPEAK OR TAKING- TAKING POSITIONS- AND HAVING TO KAISER PATIENTS BECAUSE OUR MEDICAL PATIENTS CARED FOR AN FQHC FACILITIES. AND WHEN I HEARD WAS NO THE PROPOSAL'S GONNA. LIMIT THE USE OF FACILITIES IN THIS CASE A PROPOSAL TO KAISER BRICK AND MORTAR FACILITIES NOT. FQHCS SO THAT WOULD SEEM TO ONE ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. I WAS TOLD WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT- LET THE LOCAL PLANS ARE GONNA BE LEFT WITH THE SICKEST PATIENTS WILL HVE A I HAD A COUPLE A COUPLE ISSUES THURMOND SEEMS TO ME THAT. WITH KAISER CURRENTLY SUBCONTRACTING IT TWELVE WHAT. TWELVE PLANS IN SEVENTEEN COUNTIES SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF COUNTIES I GUESS MY QUESTION IS ISN'T KAISER TREATING THE SAME PATIENTS TODAY THAT KAISER WILL BE TREATING. TOMORROW IN THE IN THE AT LEAST IN SOME SENSE OF THE WORD AND HOW DOES THAT LEAVE THE LOCAL CLANS WITH QUOTE THE SICKEST PATIENTS. IN IN THIS CASE THE CASE IS GOING TO BE TRUE THEIR LIMITS ON. THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS THAT- AND WHO THE PATIENTS ARE THE TRANSITION TO KAISER IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. AND THE 25% INCREASE OVER FIVE YEARS IS REALLY NOT MUCH OF AN INCREASE IN MY GUESS IS A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE 25% WILL BE. THOSE KAISER COMMERCIAL PATIENTS WHO BALLOTS FROM THE COMMERCIAL PLANS TO THE MEDICAL PLANS. OVER THE FIVE YEARS WHO WOULDN'T BE GOING TO. THE LOCAL PLANS ANYWAY SO IF YOU HAVE A LIMIT ON FQHC USAGE AND YOU HAVE. TO PROVIDE FOR RISK ADJUSTED CAPITATION AND OBVIOUSLY THERE'S SOME. MATHEMATICS THAT NEEDS TO GO INTO THAT TO MAKE SURE IT WORKS OUT. AND YOU HAVE A LIMIT ON MEDICAL PATIENTS MEDICAL PATIENTS ELIGIBLE FOR KAISER ENROLLMENT- WHAT'S LEFT IN TERMS OF THE OBJECTION. TO THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL OTHER THAN. I GUESS THAT IF LOCAL PLAN SUBCONTRACT WITH KAISER FOR KAISER TO TREAT FORMER KAISER PATIENTS UNDER MEDICAL YOU'RE RIGHT THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME SECURITY DIFFERENCE THERE THAT NEEDS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR THE LOCAL PLANS WON'T GET TO TAKE CREDIT FOR THE CARE THAT KAISER PROVIDES. THESE PATIENTS AND WE PROBABLY NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THAT IN THE RISK ADJUSTMENT. FAN OF COURSE SINCE ALL THIS COMES DOWN TO MONEY USUALLY IN THE HEALTHCARE FIELD. THERE IS THE LOCAL PLANS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RETAIN AND MAYBE WE NEED TO. PROVIDE SOME SORT OF HOLD HARMLESS AGREEMENT OVER SOME PERIOD OF TIME WHETHER IT'S ONE YEAR TWO YEARS THREE YEARS OR FOUR YEARS TO ALLOW. LOCAL PLANS TO RELEASE SOME OF THEM. THE TIME TO TRANSITION OFF OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE FEE FROM. A FINANCIAL STANDPOINT. HAVE I MISSED ANYTHING. SO SHE WOULD DIRECT THIS AT THE FOURTEENTH ANY OF ANY ANSWER ON WHO WANTS TO TAKE IT MAYBE WE'LL HAVE THE LOCAL HEALTH ITS FIRST ADDRESS IT SEEMS LIKE THAT'S THAT'S THE THRUST OF YOUR QUESTIONS AND OTHERS WHO WISH TO ADDRESS THAT- POINTS PROFIT CENTER ROTH SO PEOPLE START WITH ONE EQUIPMENT AND- I THINK TO START WITH ONE OF THE ISSUES YOU RAISE WHICH IS. HAIDAR CONTRACTING WITH ATHLETES EITHER NON PAY THEIR PROVIDERS. I WILL SAY THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE HEARD THAT CLARIFICATION MADE- SO I THINK I WANT TO START WITH THAT- ALSO. I THINK TO GO BACK THEIR MARKETING MY TESTIMONY- IF THAT'S THE INTENT OF THE PROPOSAL. THERE SHOULD BE LANGUAGE IN STATUTE ADDRESSING AND THAT INCLUDED IN THE AMENDMENTS WE SHARED SO WOULD WELCOME FURTHER pCONVERSATION AND CONSIDERATION OF THOSE. AND AGAIN WITHOUT LANGUAGE IN STATUTE. WE DON'T ACTUALLY THINK THAT'S AND FORCIBLE. I'M ASSUMING. LET ME JUST. LET ME JUST STOP YOU ASSUMING. THAT THE PROPOSAL CONTAINS LANGUAGE WHICH REQUIRES KAISER IS A CONDITION OF PARTICIPATING IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM IN THIS REGARD. THAT KAISER PROVIDE SERVICES ENTIRELY WITHIN THE KAISER SYSTEM. BRICK AND MORTAR SYSTEM IN THE STATE WILL THAT SUFFICE. TO ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR OBJECTION. IF LANGUAGE IS ADOPTED ON THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE I THINK IT WOULD ALLEVIATE THAT SPECIFIC CONCERNS THANK YOU I WILL SAY OUR CONCERNS ARE MUCH BROADER THAN MASSES SPEAKING A COUPLE OF THE OTHER ISSUES. RAISED SENATOR- I THINK GOING BACK TO SOME OF MY REMARKS ARE MY TESTIMONY ABOUT THAT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGING THE LOCAL FAN MODEL. A WE DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE CHANGE THAT THAT CREATE A LOCAL LEVEL IN TERMS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND LOCAL DECISION MAKING- THAT THAT I DON'T THINK CAN BE REPLICATED. BY REQUIRING AND THE USE- AND THEN ON ON THAT OF THE CLASS ARE HELP WITH LOCAL BANDS BEING LEFT AT THE SECOND. AND HIGH EITHER TO HOW MA'AM. AND THE NEXT BEST WITH THE RATE. I THINK AGAIN WE'RE ASKING FOR APPROPRIATE GUARDRAILS IN STATUTES THAT WILL ENSURE THAT THE RAPE APPROPRIATELY REFLECT. THE REST OF THE RESPECTIVE MEMBERSHIP THAT WE SERVE- SO AGAIN IT'S LANGUAGE AROUND PROCESS. TO ENSURE THAT THE RATE YOU IN FACT MATCH THE REST WHICH LEAVES YOU NOT TODAY. SO IF WE IN FACT WE'VE FOOD IF WE IN FACT GET IT RIGHT WITH RESPECT TO THE RISK ADJUSTED CAPITATION FORMULA. TO PROPERLY ACCOUNT FOR WHO'S TREATING- IN. TERMS OF ACUITY. THAT SHOULD SAY. THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE CORRECT. YES I THINK IF WE HAVE PROPOSED PACIFIC LANGUAGE ON THAT AND SHOULD THAT BE INCLUDED IN THE TRAILER BILL OR POLICY BILLS- I THINK THAT WOULD ALLEVIATE THE CONCERNS AROUND- THE RATE ISSUES GIVEN THAT THERE WOULD BE TRANSPARENCY AND A PROCESS- SO AGAIN ANYTHING IT GOES BACK TO THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE PROPOSE AND THOSE BEING CONSIDERED AND ADOPTED. RIGHT LET ME AS ONE OF THE THING AND NOBODY'S I DON'T THINK ANYBODY SPOKEN ABOUT IT BUT THIS ADMINISTRATIVE FEE WHERE THERE'S CONTRACTS IN THEIR SUBCONTRACTS BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE SHIFTING FROM A SUBCONTRACTING MODEL TO IT THE CONTRACT MODEL SO INSTEAD OF A LOCAL PLAN HAVING RESPONSIBILITY AND THEN SUB CONTRACTING BECAUSE YOUR CARE FOR KAISER RELATED PATIENTS CAUSES GETTING THE CONTRACT DIRECTLY. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATIVE FEE DO WE DO WE NEED TO ADDRESS THIS ADMINISTRATIVE FEE IN THE PROPOSAL THE LOCAL PLANS NEED TO HAVE TIME TO WEAN THEMSELVES THE PLANS OFF OF THE. ADMINISTRATIVE FEE WHATEVER IT IS. SO I'D SAY I MEAN AT FIRST ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE FEES ARE DEPENDENT I THINK A LOT OF. MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT THEIR- AND I THINK IT'S BEEN YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT THAT IS RETAINED BY LOCAL PLAN HAS BEEN MISSTATED. AND SO JUST TO CONFIRM LOCAL PLANS TODAY RETAIN 2% AS YOU INDICATED- AND AN ADMINISTRATIVE RATE- TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY ADDITIONAL. COSTS ARE NOT PASSED. HI THERE BECAUSE HI THERE IS NOT- PROVIDING CERTAIN SERVICES THAT ARE COVERED BY MEDICARE OUT OF THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING ACTUALLY GOES TO SERVICES FOR TO GIVE A FEW. EXAMPLES LONG TERM CARE MAJOR ORGAN TRANSPLANT EATING DISORDER SERVICES. SO I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT OUT OF. THE GATE BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS ABOUT IT. IN TERMS OF YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION AROUND BEING HELD HARD LINE. I THINK ON THE THAT THE RACE ISSUE. AND FINANCIAL SIDE. EIGHT OUR LANGUAGE. AGAIN REFERENCING WE PUT IN IN OUR PREFER THE NUMBER. LEAVE ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF ENSURING THAT THERE GREAT ADDED. THAT'S NOT PROPOSED UP OLD HARMLESS IT'S ENSURING- THAT RATES ARE AT RELEASED AND ACCOUNT FOR NUMBER RENT BOTH AT THE HIGH END AND THE LOW END WE DO NOT AND THAT WITH THE SCENARIO THAT MY COLLEAGUES UNDESCRIBED WHERE THE PLAN FOR BEING TO HELP YOUR NUMBERS. IT'S AN UNINTENDED BONUS SO YOU ARE YOU ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT UNDER THIS BECAUSE PROPOSAL THAT THERE ARE. HEALTH CARE BENEFITS MEDICAL BENEFITS THAT WILL NOT BE PROVIDED BY. KAISER UNDER THE PROPOSAL LONG TERM CARE AND OTHER ASPECTS THAT OTHER BENEFITS THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING PROVIDED BY LOCAL PLANS TO MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES AND IF THE ANSWER IS YES HOW DOES THAT WORK IN WHO PROVIDES THOSE BENEFITS GOING FORWARD. IF THE KAISER PROPOSAL IS ADOPTED. I WOULD DEFERRED THE- ABOUT- THE INTENT OF THE QUESTION ABOUT THE FUTURE BUT TODAY THAT IS TRUE THAT CRATER DOES NOT COVER ALL MEDICARE COVERED SERVICES. IN OUR SUB CONTRACTED RELATIONSHIP AND IT IT VARIES DEPENDING ON GEOGRAPHY OKAY WELL I'M NOT GOING TO HOG THE MIKE HERE I'M GOING TO STOP TALKING AND MAYBE SOMEBODY ELSE WILL FOLLOW THROUGH ON. WHAT'S COVERED AND WHAT WILL BE NOT COVERED IN THE UNDER THE PROPOSAL I JUST WANT TO SAY I'M TRYING TO PUT THE PIECES TOGETHER HERE I'M NOT BEING CRITICAL IN THAT. I DON'T HAVE A- ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE HAVE- A CONTRACTING ARRANGEMENT THAT WE PROVIDE APPROPRIATE MEDICAL BENEFITS TO THOSE WHO. BADLY NEED THEM THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. ACTUALLY SO YOU DON'T MIND I AS THE ACTUALLY TO SERVE FOR LIFE FINISH YOUR LAST QUESTION- PERHAPS- CAN. CAN DIRECTOR BOSS OF OR HEALTHCARE SERVICES ADDRESS THE POINT THAT WAS JUST MADE BY THE LOCAL HEALTH PLANS THAT CURRENTLY THE KAISER SUBCONTRACTORS. ARE PROVIDING ALL THE COVERED SERVICES AND WHAT THE OBLIGATIONS OF KAISER WILL BE IN TERMS OF COVERING ALL THE MEDICAL SERVICES AND THERE TO STATEWIDE CONTRACT SO- DIRECT BUS DO YOU MIND ADDRESSING THAT PARTICULAR POINT. YES I DREADED THE PROPOSAL AND UNDER THE NEW CONTRACT THAT WOULD GO LIKE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR KAISER WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING ALL OF THE RELEVANT. MANAGED CARE BENEFITS THAT ARE NOT CARVED OUT OF A CANDIDATE THE BANDAGE CARE. PLAN AND I WOULD KNOW YOU KNOW AS AS I WAS GIVEN UP LOADED TO IN THE KAISER'S RELATIONSHIP WITH FIND PLANS VARIES ACROSS THE STATE AND IN SOME INSTANCES THOSE LOCAL PLANTS DO NOT. I REFUSE TO CONTRACT WITH KAISER FOR SOME OF THESE SERVICES SO UNDER THIS PROPOSAL KAISER WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE. FOR ALL ALL OF THE PLAN BENEFITS. WHAT THE HELL CENTER OFF YES OKAY. THANK YOU RIGHT- CEREMONY. THANK YOU. AND I APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION AND ON AND THE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS I'VE HAD SEVERAL DISCUSSIONS WITH A SEVERAL FOLKS I'M ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE AND- YOU KNOW I THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS FOR DIFFERENT COUNTIES- AND CERTAINLY AS THESE IDEAS COME FORWARD. I HAVE A THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT- AT YOU KNOW I REPRESENT INTER COUNTY IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY WHY. HAVE INTERCOUNTY WITH. EIGHT IN SUMMER WITHOUT A KAISER. BUT I THINK. AS A LAW OF THESE EIGHTY COME. THROUGH THE- OF A LEAD. WHO HAS. FOR YOU- ARE COMMUNITY PIECE TOGETHER. WHEN WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO SOME OF THE BIG NAME WHEN WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE SERVICE TO THE SPECIALTIES AND THE LIST GOES ON. AND WHAT I'VE LEARNED IS THAT WE HAVE TO- CERTAINLY YOU THINK ABOUT THE TRUST THAT'S BUILT WITH THE COMMUNITY WE HAVE TO THINK- ABOUT HOW WE ACCESS CARE IN FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT COUNTIES. AND SO. THE LENDS IT A LOOK AT THIS WITH IT IS ONE OF FROM MY COUNTY THAT'S TRULY STRUGGLED- TO BRING IN HEALTH PROVIDERS A COMMUNITY THAT HAS STRUGGLED TO FIND THE SPECIALTY NEEDS. A COMMUNITY THAT'S BEEN TOLD IF YOU DRIVE YOU KNOW ANOTHER FIFTY SIXTY SEVENTY WHATEVER MILES YOU CAN GET X. CARE. ACT IN SO WITH THAT LIVES IN MINE I APPROACH THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL. M. WITH CONCERNS- AND I THINK THE CONCERNS ARE BASED ON SOME OF WHAT I'VE HEARD OTHER COLLEAGUES THAT THE CLEAR CLARITY THAT PROVIDES CONFIDENCE AND TRUST FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S A FUNCTION OF- WRONG INTENTIONS I THINK THAT THAT'S JUST IT'S A BIG PROPOSAL AND ITS NEW- AND SO. IT SEEMS THAT YOU KNOW ONE OF ONE OF THE PIECES THAT UP FOR ME IS IMPORTANT IS SINCE TO SUSTAIN AND FIND WAYS TO AGGREGATE RATE- AND TO ADD TO THE CARE THAT WE HAVE IN OUR COMMUNITIES KNOWING THAT WE ME- BUT YOU KNOW WE MAY OR MAY NOT BENEFIT FROM A PLAN LIKE THIS. AND WHILE THE STATE BENEFITS- YOU KNOW I DO WONDER WE AND WE TALKED ABOUT FIVE COUNTIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY. YOU KNOW THAT KAISER HAS THAT ARE DIRECT. CONTRACT AND THEN ANOTHER SEVENTEEN THAT'S TWENTY TWO THAT STILL LEAVES THIRTY SIX COUNTIES- WHICH IS WHICH ARE A LOT AND I UNDERSTAND THAT PERHAPS THIS THIRTY SIX COUNTIES DON'T RUFFLE REPORT THAT REFLECT THE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION THE STATE BUT I STILL THINK ARE VERY IMPORTANT COUNTIES. WITH VERY DIFFERENT COMMUNITY STRUCTURES. OF CARE THAT ARE INTO GOING TO POTENTIALLY BE A PART OF THIS SO ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I ASKED AND THIS IS FOR THE DIRECTOR- IS WHY NOT JUST EXPLICITLY. EXEMPT THEM AND SAY THAT THEY ARE NOT PART OF THIS AND THE ANSWER THAT THAT I RECEIVED AS WELL BECAUSE IT'S IMPLIED. BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT IN A SYSTEM OF CARE- DISRUPTING EVEN IF THE DISRUPTION HAS A POSITIVE OUTCOME- EATING CAUSES A MOMENT OF CONCERN AND- CERTAINLY CONFUSE YOU KNOW A LACK OF CLARITY SO I WANT TO RECAST THAT. WHY NOT JUST EXEMPTS. CLUB COUNTIES THAT WOULD NOT BE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THIS AND THIS IS FOR DIRECTOR BASS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND AS I MENTIONED- IN OUR CONVERSATION OUR FACT SHEET THAT LISTS THE COUNTIES THAT THIS APPLIES TO YOU THE CLIP THE COUNTIES WERE KAISER HAS A COMMERCIAL OR MEDICARE LINE OF BUSINESS SO. IT WOULD BE EXPANDING AS WE TALKED ABOUT THE TWENTY TWO THIS WOULD BE THE ADDITIONAL TEN- SO FOR A THIRTY TWO COUNTIES IN TOTAL THAT THIS THIS CONTRACT WOULD APPLY TO. YOU KNOW IN IN IN CONVERSATIONS AND KIND OF TRYING TO. WORK WITH- AT WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND ADVOCATES AND- AND THE PLANS THE IN TERMS OF PROVIDING MORE CLARITY WERE HAPPY TO CREDIT ENGAGE IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS TO CONSIDER HOW TO PROVIDE THAT. BUT INTERACTION WE DID LOOK ALL OF THE COUNTIES THAT THE SUPPLY STILL. CORRECT AND I GUESS THAT IS IT'S THAT AND BEGIN. THAT A IT'S CREATING A- OF THE MISTRUST RIGHT- THAT IF COMMUNITIES AND COUNTIES FEEL THE NEED TO BE EXPLICITLY TOLD YOU'RE NOT IN. JUST BECAUSE IT SAYS YOU'RE NOT ON THE LIST DOESN'T ACTUALLY IMMEDIATELY EQUATE TO YOU'RE NOT AND BECAUSE YOU COULD BE IT IN THE FUTURE. IF THIS- IF THIS SETS A PRECEDENT FOR OTHER TYPES OF MODELS- I THINK COMMUNITY SHOULD BE AWARE WHETHER EACH YOU KNOW IT COULD POTENTIALLY IMPACT THEM- SO. FOR ME THAT DISTINCTION AS MEANINGFUL- TO STATE WELL YOU'RE NOT ON THE LIST IS NOT THE SAME DISTINCTION THE SCENE. YOU'RE EXPLICITLY EXEMPT FROM THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT- OR PROGRAM. SO YOU KNOW I A THROW THAT OUT THERE- THE NEXT PIECE THAT I HAVE IS IT IN THIS IS- FOR ALL REALLY INVOLVED AND WHOEVER WANTS TO JUMP IN. WE ARE NOT SEEN A DIRECT BILL IN FRONT OF US HOWEVER WE KNOW THAT THERE'S TWO PATHS THAT ARE BEING EXPLORED A DIRECT BILL- THAT'S COMING THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY. AS WELL AS CONVERSATIONS IN THE BUDGET. AND WE OFTENTIMES IN THIS COMMITTEE. LOOK AT BILLS AND TALK ABOUT AMENDMENTS AND WHERE IS THE NEGOTIATION AND HOW FAR WEAK. AND TRULY THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED WITH THIS. IT HAS NOT HAPPENED AND I AM CURIOUS WHAT ARE. WHAT'S THE PROCESS FOR AMENDMENTS ARE WE REALLY. TO MOVE SOMETHING FORWARD- WITHOUT TAKING THIS INPUT AND SOMEONE. DELIBERATELY TELLING US WHERE WE ARE WITH AMENDMENTS- THEY'RE JUST IN THIS CONVERSATION THERE'S BEEN SUGGESTIONS FOR MULTIPLE TYPE OF AMENDMENTS IN THE FORM OF CLARITY. WHEN ARE THOSE GOING TO GET IN A BILL OR WHEN OTHER WINNERS LANGUAGE GONNA BE PROPOSED FOR THAT THAT'S AGREED UPON. SO I'M HOPING THAT SOMEONE CAN TELL US- WHAT THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS IS LIKE- AND WHEN WE- MIGHT AS LEGISLATORS EXPECT TO SEE. LANGUAGE WITH AMENDMENTS. WELL MAYBE I'LL TRY TO. ADDRESS THAT QUESTION FIRST AND THEN I. DON'T KNOW IF OTHERS SPEAKERS WANT TO- REPORTS THAT WHY THIS IS A JOINT. OF THE BUDGETS OF ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND THE HEALTH COMMITTEE- SO WE DOCTOR ARE USED AS POINTED OUT BEFORE. THERE'S CURRENTLY A VEHICLE IN THE ASSEMBLY- IN FACT WHEN THE PROPOSAL CAME OUT FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE- BOTH THE ASSEMBLY THE SENATE TALKED ABOUT THE NEED FOR A POLICY VEHICLE GIVEN THE EXTENSIVE POLICY ISSUES THAT RELATED TO THAT OF. THE US- SO MEMBER AND LET HIS AUTHORED SUCH A VEHICLE SO IT'S OVER IN THE ASSEMBLY. BUT ALSO OF COURSE WE'RE HEARING THAT THIS MAY BE PART OF BUDGET PROCESS. AND SO THE NATURE OF THE NEGOTIATIONS OF COURSE IS THAT- WHAT WE'RE DISCUSSING HERE GETS INCORPORATED INTO THAT WE HAVE BUDGET STAFF HERE- IN THE AUDIENCE AS WELL AS COMMITTEE STAFF HERE WOULD THEY'RE THEY'RE TAKING NOTES AND LISTENING AND- SO. THAT WILL HELP SHAPE- WHAT WE WILL BE- AS THE SENATE AND THEN OF COURSE THE ASSEMBLY DO THEIR OWN PROCESS AND- TELL THE WHOLE BUDGET PROCESS WHERE DISCIPLINE CENTER TOGETHER AND THEN. WE TALK TO THE GOVERNOR RIGHT AND SET SO THE THREE PARTIES. SO. THAT NEGOTIATION. WILL HAPPEN IF IT'S A BUDGET. BILL AS IF IT'S THAT WE'RE NOT DO IS BY TRAILER AGAIN WE THE LATEST. GET THE DECIDE BECAUSE WE DON'T PUT IN THE BUDGET. HAPPEN RIGHT- SO THAT IN WHICH CASE WE SAY THAT'S THE VEHICLE THAT OF COURSE IT WOULD THE BILL WOULD FORMALLY COME TO THIS COMMITTEE AND- THE OPPORTUNITY AS WELL THIS COMMITTEE TO A MEN'S AS WELL- SO- EVEN THOSE INFORMATIONAL HEARING I THINK WHAT YOU'RE- THE QUESTIONS YOU RAISE ANY ISSUES RAISED HERE TODAY- WILL. HELP INFORM THE TYPES OF CHANGES THAT WE- MAY SEE AND A OF ITS BUDGET TRAILER BILL- OR- AND THEN OF COURSE IF IT COMES HERE TO FORMAL. THAT THE RAMBLER BILL COMES YOUR FORMALLY A FEW OF THE NUMBERS OFF TOP OF MY HEAD THEN WILL HAVE A CHANCE AS WELL. NOW THIS A SERVER ADMIN DID YOU WISH ALSO. ON JUST I WOULD SAY THE SAME THAT THE THINK. THERE IS A VEHICLE ON IN THE OTHER HOUSE. THE OF THIS IS REALLY BE HERE. CONCERN SO NO MATTER NO MATTER HOW OR IF THIS MOVES FORWARD ALL OF OUR INPUT WOULD BE. INTEGRATED INTO THE FINAL. YEAH AND WE WANT TO BE SURE WE DID THIS BEFORE. THE THAT THAT MAY REVISED SO THAT IF IT'S TRUE IT IS BUDGET TRAILER BILL. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE VEHICLE YET IN OUR HOUSE THAT- THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION. SO THAT PROCESS UNDERSTOOD AT A THINK I'M STILL NOT CLEAR ON HOW THE CONVERSATIONS ARE GOING IN REGARDS TO AMENDMENTS BECAUSE DISCUSSIONS. AND CONVERSATIONS RELATED TO AMENDMENTS- ARE. ARE PART OF THIS EQUATION AND YOU KNOW AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT EVEN THOUGH THERE'S INFORMATION OUT THERE- WHETHER IT'S A FACTUALLY OR INFORMATION OUT THERE OR EVEN PROPOSED AMENDMENTS NONE OF THAT IS LAW. IT'S NOT LONG UNTIL IT'S IN A YOU KNOW IT'S IN A TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE OR- IN. THE BILL ITSELF AND SO FOR ME WITHOUT SEEING ANY MOVEMENT ON EITHER OF THOSE I DON'T KNOW. WHERE WE ARE AT WITH THAT AND- IN IN THIS CONVERSATION ALONE THERE'S A LOT OF VERBAL AGREEMENTS ON POINTS THAT COULD BE CLARIFIED BUT I'VE NOT YET SEEN THOSE PUT INTO EITHER FORM OF THE LAW. AND PERHAPS THEY WON'T SEE THOSE ANY TIME SOON- BUT I JUST WANT TO ENCOURAGE US TO NOT RELY ON INFORMATION FOR FACT SHEETS BECAUSE THAT IS NOT THE EQUIVALENT OF A LAW- IN TERMS OF. YOU KNOW WHERE THESE NEGOTIATION GOES- AND FINALLY ALL JUST SIT YOU KNOW AND IF SOMEONE WANTS TO MENTION THE CAB AT ALL CLOSE WITH. JUST GENERALLY SAYING THAT TO ME THIS IS NOT. I WOULD BE RAISING THESE ISSUES WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS KAISER PERMANENTE HEY SO THIS IS TO ME IS NOT ABOUT KAISER SPECIFICALLY AND- THERE'S NOT A LACK OF TRUST WITH THAT THE ENTITY. THIS IS SIMPLY RIFAT REFLECTING THE PERSPECTIVE OF A LEGISLATOR WHO HAS HAD TO PIECE TOGETHER HEALTH CARE- AND WHO AND WHEN YOU BRING IN MODELS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY DISRUPT THAT- YOU. END UP WITH PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE CARE. AND THAT'S TO ME AT THE CORE OF WHERE THESE COMMENTS COMMENTS ARE COMING FROM- I ALSO YOU KNOW WE OFTEN SEE VERY WELL INTENTIONED- BILLS AND IDEAS COME FORWARD- BUT I THINK IT'S UPON US TO JUST MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS DON'T FALL APART- IT YOU KNOW. AND COMMUNITIES DON'T END UP WITH GOOD INTENTIONS THAT TRANSLATE TO. SOMEONE NOT GETTING THE CARE THEY NEED BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T SEE SOMEONE OR BECAUSE THE MODELS CHANGE- BECAUSE REIMBURSEMENT RATES ARE. ARE SUCH THAT. IT'S NOW CAUSED ACCESS ISSUES SO- YOU KNOW THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS AND I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE EVERYONE HAS BEEN ON ALL SIDES OF THIS HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY- HELPFUL THEY'VE BEEN RUDE PROACTIVE IN REACHING OUT- AND I WANT TO COMMEND FOLKS FOR ALLOWING US TO REALLY. DIG DEEP INTO THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. THANK YOU SIR LIMÓN. I WOULD MAKE NOTE- DATS- COURSE PERHAPS THE OTHER PARTY SHOULD JUST MENTION IS I THINK YOU BROUGHT UP CEREMONY IS THAT YOU HAVE THE PORTION THAT ACTUALLY WERE PUTTING INTO CODE. SO WHAT SO WHAT I BUDGET TRAILER BILL A BILL AND THEN THERE'S OTHER PARTS IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S MORE OF AN AGREEMENT IS GONNA BE DONE IN OTHER WAYS BUT YET IT'S NOT AND LAW AND I THINK CERTAINLY SOME PEOPLE RAISE THE QUESTION OF. HOW FORCIBLE IS THAT RIGHT IT'S ADDRESS SO- SO ONE OF THINGS THAT WE MAY NEED TO LOOK AT IS WHAT WE ACTUALLY ARE PUTTING CODE WHAT HOW MUCH OF THE PROPOSAL IS NOT BEING PUT IN TRUST ME YOU KNOW WHAT'S BETTER. OKAY IF I JUST AS- B. CENTER LAMONT JUST FOR MY OWN. TO SO I CAN UNDERSTAND GOING. INTO TAKING THIS FORWARD- YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IF THE COUNTY IS NOT IT DOES NOT HAVE A KAISER. BRICKS AND MORTAR AND OR PART OF THAT. THAT IF THE COUNTY IS NOT INVOLVED HELP ME UNDERSTAND HOW HOW YOU FEEL LIKE THAT THAT THEN IMPACTS THEIR LOCAL CARE SYSTEM IS IT ON THE BORDER ISSUES OR IS IT ON SO IT COULD BE I MEAN IT COULD BE AND I THINK EVERY COUNTY IS VERY DIFFERENT- RIGHT YOU HAVE DIFFERENT EMPLOYERS WITH DIFFERENT PROVIDERS THAT DO MULTI COUNTY WORK- AND SO WHEN YOU HAVE. ANY LIKE SANTA BARBARA COUNTY THAT HAS NO KAISER PER SE IS NOT IS GOING TO BE EXEMPT IS NOT GOING TO BE INVOLVED FOR A SONG CAL LOCAL SYSTEM- BUT THEN YOU HAVE INTERCOUNTY I MEAN I HAVE HIGH COMMUTER SO ALL OF THIS STARTS TO GET INTERTWINED VERY QUICKLY RIGHT IN TERMS OF WHERE YOU LIVE AND WHERE YOU WORK FROM YOUR EMPLOYER IS. WHERE YOU HAVE ACCESS THE PROXIMITY OF MILES- AND SO FOR ME I THINK ONE OF THE PIECES OF CLARITY THAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS IF THIS APPLIES TO- IF THIS DOESN'T APPLY TO A COUNTY PLEASED TO SAY THAT- AND DON'T SAY WILL IT ONLY APPLIES TO ACTS SAY IT DOESN'T APPLY TO Y. I THINK THAT THAT'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT HELPS US UNDERSTAND. WHAT CARE IS AVAILABLE OR WHAT IS NOT A MAN WHO THIS PARTICULARLY MAY OR MAY NOT DISRUPT. THANK YOU. AND JUST RELATED TO THIS BEFORE THE A LABEL HEALTH OKAY ALL RIGHT SIR LEYVA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- WELL OKAY THERE'S A LOT HERE SO I WOULD SAY THAT- I LEARNED A LONG TIME AGO THAT WE PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS IT GENERALLY DOESN'T WORK AND I WOULD SAY THAT CLEARLY HERE PEOPLE FEEL THAT KAISER IS A WINNER AND THAT OUR LOCAL PLANS ARE THE LOSERS WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S TRUE IT SEEMS THAT THAT SEEMS TO BE THE FEELING. ALSO PEOPLE DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY'VE BEEN HEARD IS WHAT IT SEEMS TO ME AS WELL AND WHEN YOU HEAR PEOPLE SOMETIMES YOU FIND OUT THAT MAYBE WHAT YOU THOUGHT WAS RIGHT ISN'T RIGHT AND MAYBE WE CAN FIND A WAY TO RESOLVE ISSUES OR AT LEAST MAKE PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO VOICE THEIR CONCERNS I WANT. AT EVERYONE'S OPEN TO TALK BUT I FEEL LIKE BOTH SIDES ARE STILL COMPLETELY IN THEIR OWN CAMPS AND NEITHER SIDE WILL PACERS HAPPY BUT I DON'T FEEL LIKE OUR LOCAL PLANS ARE HAPPY OR FEEL GOOD ABOUT THIS PROCESS ONE AND I DON'T THINK ANY OF US FEEL I CERTAINLY DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE PROCESS ONE THING YOU WAKE UP ONE MORNING AND FIND AT THESE NEGOTIATIONS HAVE BEEN GOING ON AND THEN YOU'RE JUST TOLD- THAT THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. TO CEREMONIES POINT WE HAVE NOTHING IN THE LAW WE HAVE NOTHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO TO TRY AND MAKE IT BETTER OR TRY AND GET TO A POINT WHERE EVERYBODY'S A LITTLE HAPPY AND A LITTLE UNHAPPY. SO I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS- THE FIRST ONE IS FOR YOU- DIRECTOR BASS YESTERDAY WHEN WE MET YOU SAID KAISER DOES NOT CROP CONTRACT OUT TODAY. EXCEPT FOR MAYBE TRAUMA. SO MY QUESTION IS THAT IS THAT ACTUALLY TRUE BECAUSE THEN I'VE ALSO HEARD FROM LOCAL PLANTS THAT KAISER CONTRACTS OUT ALL THE TIME. BECAUSE I THINK MIKE MY ORIGINAL QUESTION WAS- WHY IS IT THAT MORE PEOPLE CAN'T BE OPEN. TO BEING ENROLLED AT KAISER IF YOU HAVE MEDICARE WHAT IS IT ONLY HAVE TO BE- SOMEONE WHO IS ALREADY HAS TIES OR IS A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY. AND THEN THE RESPONSE WAS IT BECAUSE IT DOES NOT CONTRACT OUT EXCEPT FOR MAYBE TRAUMA. SO DOES CALL IT KAISER CONTRACT OUT FOR SERVICES. OTHER THAN TRAUMA. I THINK THAT QUESTION YESTERDAY REALLY. THE DO CONTRACT THAT WE KNOW THE CONTRACT FOR TRAUMA HOSPITAL SERVICES I THINK THAT THE POINT. COM ABOUT. CARE AND EAT THE TEACHER THE BABY'S TAKE A PRIMARY CARE WITHIN THEIR THEIR FACILITIES BUT THEY DO WE KNOW IN SOME OF THE- WERE PLANTED. AT IN WHERE THEY HAVE GROESCHEL AND MEDICARE OF THAT YOU CONTRACT WITH WITH HOSPITALS TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY. SO THAT IS THE POINT OF CLARIFICATION. OKAY SO. YOUR CALL. OUT FOR EVERYTHING EXCEPT PRIMARY CARE. I MEAN IF YOU WANT A COMPLETE LISTING OF HOW THE OPERATE THEIR LINES OF BUSINESS IS IF I CAN TELL YOU WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION BUT I THINK GENERALLY SPEAKING AND THE REASON WHY WE ARE APPROACHING THEM DIFFERENTLY IS BECAUSE FOR THEIR THEIR INTEGRATED CARE THEIR PRIMARY CARE. IS IN HOUSE BIT MORE CLEAR YESTERDAY IT SEEMED LIKE THEY DIDN'T CONTRACT OUT FOR ANYTHING- BUT SOUNDS LIKE THEY DO SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CONTINUITY OF CARE. IN FACT IF YOU ARE A KAISER SUBSCRIBER YOU. MIGHT BE CONTRACTED OUT FOR A PARTICULAR SERVICE THAT KAISER. DOES NOT OFFER IN THE BRICK AND MORTAR. SO OKAY- AND THEN MY OTHER QUESTION IS- I THINK IT WAS JOSE- FROM HEALTH ACCESS SAID THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN MO YOU WITH EACH COUNTY IS THAT POSSIBLE. THE POSSIBLE FOR KAISER TO DO AN MO YOU WITH EACH COUNTY AND JOSE HOPE AYE MISTER CÁC S. I HOPE I'M- ACCURATELY STATING WHAT YOU SAID. I CAN SPEAK TO THAT- BUT HAS ANYONE HAD ANSWER FIRST. YES THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE QUESTION SO- IN ESSENCE YES AND THAT'S WHAT WE WERE ORIGINALLY WANTED TO DO AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT KAISER PARTNERS WITH THE LOCAL COUNTY SO THAT MAKE MAKING SURE THAT WE DO PROVIDE THAT FOCUS ON WHOLE PERSON CARE IT M. AND THEN A DAY SOME OF THE BEST SERVICE SOME OF THE SOME OF SPECIFIC SERVICES ARE BEST PROVIDED. BY COUNTIES AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NO RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN KAISER AND THE EXISTING COUNTIES- THAT THEY WILL BE IN OKAY SO KAISER IS THAT POSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD DO IT MO YOU WITH EACH COUNTY. ABSOLUTELY IT'S IN FACTORY- SO I THINK AT- I SEE I'M SEE DIRECTOR BOND STREET YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY GREAT BECAUSE- WOULD REQUIRE. TO COMPLY WITH ALL OF THE NEW REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING CALLAHAM SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS. I AND I CAN CERTAINLY SEE THAT KAISER PERMANENT DAY IS COMMITTED TO MEETING ALL THE REQUIREMENTS WHICH INCLUDES. I'M HAVING AND WILL USE WITH ALL THE COUNTIES AND WHICH OPERATE AS WELL AS OTHER PROVIDERS. I'M FOR EXAMPLE TO ARRANGE FOR PROVIDING YOUR COMMITTEE SUPPORTS- WHICH ARE WHICH ARE PART OF CALTRAIN STOPS ITALY I THINK- AND EVERYTHING THAT I COULD SHARE IS THAT IN CURRENT STATE THAT'S WHAT WE DO- DIRECT. THESE TURN IN OUR TRACK COUNTY YOU HAVE AND WILL USE. THAT A RISK. BUT ALSO. JUST TO BE QUITE FOR IT'S THE BEST WAY TO PROVIDE CARE BECAUSE WE CAN'T. PROVIDE CARE FOR MEMBERS IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE WE DON'T HAVE AGREEMENTS. WITH FOR EXAMPLE COUNTY AGENCIES TO COORDINATE CARE FOR EXAMPLE IS SPECIAL T. MENTAL- PUBLIC HEALTH AND OTHER OTHER EXAMPLES. LIKE THAT'S ABSOLUTELY WE DO IN CURRENCY- YOU KNOW WITH OUR TRADE CONTRACT THAT WILL BE EXPANDED- YOU KNOW IF THE PROPOSED CONTRACT GOES TO AN ALL THIRTY TWO COUNTS ACROSS STATE. BUT AND ALSO DO ABBAS HAND IF J. F. YOU. PROCEED YOU. I WANTED TO EARLIER IN. OUR NEW CAR. THE IS A- PRINCIPLE THAT ONE OF. TO ALL OF OUR MEN CARE FOR OKAY. OUR NEW COMMERCIAL PLAY AND THE- PLANS. THESE MO YOU WITH CHILD WELFARE. COULD OF CARE. WHAT PROGRAMS. EIGHT FOR AGING. ALL OF THESE REALLY. FUNDING QUE. BASE WORK. AND LOCAL K. DEPARTMENT. ARE I'M FOR MARCUS. THE TERMS OF ADDRESS SOCIAL DRIVERS OF AND SO. WITH OUR NEW REQUIRED HAVE THESE. YOU OKAY. THANK YOU WILL AT THAT WE'RE- PROGRESS ALL MAYBE. THE EVERYONE CAN AGREE ON WE'RE GETTING THERE- OKAY. THE OTHER TWO QUESTIONS I HAD. WERE DOES THIS AGREEMENT. GIVE OVERLY BROAD AUTHORITY TO DH CS. SO DH CS COULD MAKE CHANGES. TO ITS CONTRACTING ARRANGE WITH KAISER WITHOUT ANY CORRESPONDING CHANGES IN STATUTE. AND THUS WITHOUT CONSULTATION OF THE LEGISLATURE. COUNTIES LOCAL PLANTS AND OTHER MEDICAMENT. CAL STAKEHOLDERS IS THAT ACCURATE. IS THE QUESTION TO ME IT ANYBODY IF I JUST WANT OF WHAT I SAID WAS ACCURATE SO WHOEVER. WANTS TO ANSWER. WELL MAYBE WHAT THE DIRECTOR START AND THEN WILL FOLLOW THE LOCAL HEALTH PLANS OKAY. DR I AM MAKING OUR ARE WE HAVE A STANDARDIZED CONTRACT THAT WE ARE APPLYING TO ALL OF OUR MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PLANS AND SO THAT CONTRACT WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE THE SAME FOR ALL OF OUR MEDICAL MANAGED CARE PLANS AND WE DO ANNUAL UPDATES TO THAT PLAN WE DO ACROSS. ACROSS THE STATE SO IT IS THE SAME PROVISIONS FOR ALL. FOR YOU COULD MAKE CHANGES WITHOUT ANY CONSULTING- THE LEGISLATURE OR ANYONE ELSE BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING IN THE STATUTE OR LAW. AT PRACTICE TODAY EVEN BEFORE THIS KAISER PROPOSED PROPOSAL I THINK THAT IS IT'S JUST THE WAY THAT THE CONTRACTING ARRANGEMENT IS BETWEEN THE STATE AND THAT. OUR MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PLANS ANYTHING JUST TO. ARE YOU KNOW PART OF DISAGREEMENT WITH KAISER SOME OF THE TERMS WILL BE A PUBLIC MO YOU THAT- WILL BE% PUBLIC INTEREST IN TIME IN TERMS OF HOW WE TO SENATOR PAN'S POINT EARLIER SOME OF THESE PIECES WILL BE CODIFIED SOME OF THESE WILL BE. IN IN FOR SPEED AND- YOU BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THE ENROLLMENT NUMBERS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ENROLLMENT NUMBERS WILL BE JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND WE WOULD WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR IN IN TERMS OF OUR AMMO YOU WITH HIGHS ARE ON THAT. ONCE WE HAVE THOSE MOMENTS WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION OKAY AND I THINK MAYBE WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS A LITTLE MORE CLOSELY JUST BECAUSE THE PROCESS OF GIVING KAISER THE CONTRACT WAS NOT OPEN AND TRANSPARENT. SO DID YOU WANT TO LOOK AT THE PLANS ALSO JUST SAID YES OKAY YES IF WE CAN ALSO HAVE LANIER KOOPMANS ALSO ADDRESSED THE QUESTION OF CERTAINLY THOSE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. AND I THINK I WOULD ANSWER THAT QUESTION THAT QUESTION IS YES LEAD WE DO THINK THAT THAT'S GOOD AT LEAST AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED. GRANT OVERLY BROAD AUTHORITY TO BE YES. I THINK YOU HEARD THE CONVERSATION EARLIER- YOUR QUESTION FROM FEDERAL AMOUNT. ABOUT WHERE THE PROPOSAL APPLIES AND DOES NOT- CURRENTLY THAT INFORMATION IS ONLY IN A FACT SHEET. WE THINK IT SHOULD BE EXPLICIT IN THE STATUTE. SIMILARLY WITH RESPECT TO CATER GROWTH. I THINK WE'VE HEARD THAT- THAT YEAH IT WILL BE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. OVER THE CONTRACT TERM. THERE'S NOTHING IN THE STATUTE THAT SEEKS TO GROW THROUGH THE NUMBER OF OTHER YOU KNOW. ISSUES THAT. WE THINK SHOULD BE EXPLICITLY ADDRESSED IN STATUTE- THAT HAVE BEEN TO- I CONTACT. THAT ARE NOT REFER. AND WHAT BEING PROPOSED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF A THREE THE LINK. GREAT THANK YOU LAST THANK YOU FOR AND ALL MISTER CHAIR SO MY LAW QUESTION IS DOES THE- FOR A NO BID STATEWIDE KAISER CONTRACT SUPPORT THE INTERESTS OF A COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLAN. AT THE EXPENSE OF THE PUBLIC MEDICAL DELIVERY SYSTEM AND THE BENEFICIARIES IT SERVES. I I'M GUESSING THAT THE DEPARTMENT THINKS NO IT DOESN'T AND THAT THE PLANS THINK YES IT DOES. I WOULD JUST NOTE HEISER IS A NON PROFIT JUST LIKE OUR LOCAL PLANS AND JUST LIKE OUR LOCAL PLANTS DID NOT HAVE TO BID FOR A CONTRACT THIS IS YOU KNOW SIMILAR AND NOT BEING THE OLD. SO I THINK THAT IT I WOULD JUST MAKE THOSE TWO POINTS. THANK YOU ANSWERED A QUESTION I SEE SHOWING UP. THANK YOU YEAH IF I A MAYES FIRST BY AND YEAH THERE RIGHT RIGHT PLACE. YEAH WE'RE A DIFFERENT PLACE THE DEPARTMENT TERMS OF OUR- PERSPECTIVE ON PROPOSAL AND IT'S AN ON AND COULD INTO IT'S A- BUT THAT THE MAKING PERIL BETWEEN THE LOCAL PLAN AND HOW. I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT LOCAL PLAN THE LOCAL EDITION AND COUNTY GUYS HELP SYSTEMS ARE PUT AND- THAT HAVE GOVERNANCE. HE COST AND LEADERSHIP AS WELL AS HOW SUPERVISOR. ON THE BOARD. SO THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES AND WELL AS WE- COUNTY OREGON. I THINK THE COMPARISON TO BE ON A I FEEL LIKE A IT'S AGAIN. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I ALSO ON TO REITERATE WITH SAID LIMÓN SAID I WOULD BE OUT THESE. IF IT WAS SOME APPROACH OTHER THAN CUT- WHEN I TO GO. A MEDICAL BENEFITS FOR WORKERS WE ALWAYS MADE SURE WE KICKING BANK. UP HIGHS ARE PROPONENT BECAUSE- MANY FOLKS REALLY LIKE THAT MODEL ONCE WE ALWAYS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE THAT. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT DISADVANTAGING ONE GROUP OVER ANOTHER- ONE HEALTH PLAN OVER ANOTHER. AND I HOPE I REALLY HOPE THAT WE GET SOMETHING IN STATUTE AND THAT WE CAN LOOK AT THE BILL THAT'S WORKING ITS WAY THROUGH. AND MAYBE COME UP WITH SOMETHING AS I SAID EARLIER WHERE EVERYBODY'S A LITTLE HAPPY AND A LITTLE UNHAPPY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THIS LEYVA IT PLEASE. OKAY YEAH I THINK I JUST A QUICK POINTS OF. JUSTER AROUND I GUESS. WHO BENEFITS ARE PART OF I THINK. I THINK WHAT'S WHAT'S- FROM THE PROPOSED AND HOPEFULLY- HOPEFULLY WITH SHARED SOME OF THE- I DIDN'T THINKING. IT IS I REALLY GOING BACK TO THE CALL. SHE HAS YOUR DAYS THE HIGHEST QUALITY PERFORM. MEDICAL PLAN STATE ACCOUNT I THINK THAT'S A SENATOR THERE'S A COUPLE CASH FOR THAT THE- HOW. THAT SHOWS THAT- REALLY I THINK THINK THAT'S REALLY THE IMPORTANT POINT THAT I THINK I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS THAT HAS YOU COMMITTEE. I WILL NOT. PROPOSAL I WILL BE GETTING RATE I'M- MEDIC CALLOUS INDIFFERENCE AND LOSS IN FACT- COMMITTEE. NEARLY TWO. DOLLARS A YEAR- ANNUALLY IN MEDIC. THIS PROPOSAL- MAKING EVEN MORE COMMITMENTS TO THE MEDICAL DRUG PROGRAM AND DESPITE THESE LOSSES- WE'RE SIMPLY- COMMITTED TO OUR CORE MISSION IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO- FOR PREVENTING CAL MEMBERS AND ALSO FOR THE ENTIRE MEDICARE PROGRAM SINCE WHEN THAT PILOT THAT POINT TO. IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW- YOU KNOW WITH WHO BENEFITS FROM THIS REALLY AYE AYE I THINK FROM THE KAISER COMMITTEE PERSPECTIVES FOR THE MEDIC CAL. PROGRAMS AND LISTEN FOR THE. BENEFITS YEARS. THANK YOU I'M- THAT I JUST KNOW THAT MY FIRST. WITH I TOLD THAT BECAUSE- FROM KAISER THAT THE DO NOT MAKE MONEY ON MANTA. ALL AND I SAID YOU HAVE TO A- TO IN INTO THE A- IT IT'S- TO BEEN A- KAISER IN SOME WAY YOU TO NOT. ENTER AGREEMENT AND TO PROP OR NOT. IF IT'S NOT GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL SO MY QUESTION WAS IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO. MONEY ARE YOU GOING TO LOSE. MONEY AND I MONEY SO THAT IS A BENEFIT IF YOU'RE LOSING MONEY YOU'RE GONNA LOSE LESS. THAT'S A BENEFIT SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR INDULGING ME OKAY. OTHER QUESTIONS BEFORE OKAY CENTER RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THIS IS REALLY NOT FOR- THE LOCAL HEALTH PLANS WERE CRIES RATING TO ME YOU KNOW I THINK I SHARE THE CONCERNS OF MY COLLEAGUES WERE- YOU KNOW WE'RE DISCUSSING THIS. KIND OF CAT I WOULD AS HE CASUALLY BUT YOU KNOW I PERSONALLY LIKE TO SEE ALSO SOMETHING IN PRINCETON. YOU KNOW I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING IT AND THEN SEEN THESE IMPRENTA BUT- NO JUST GOING BACK TO THE INITIAL NOT. COMMONER QUESTION WHERE SHE- ONE SIDE DOESN'T HAVE THE FULL INFORMATION SO. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN ONCE THEY DO HAVE THE PHONE PERMISSION THAT BECOMES ANOTHER ISSUE TO DISCUSS LATER BUT- I PERSONALLY AGAIN IT'S JUST PROCESS IN GENERAL WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOMETHING IN PRINT BEFORE WE JUST SE IT ON A TRAILER BILL. AND I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN. ACCOMPLISH THAT GIVEN THE YOU KNOW THE TIMELINE BUT- THERE'S A LOT OF. QUESTIONS IN AND THAT'S YOU KNOW REALLY SOMETHING THAT CONCERNS ME BUT- I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT WE CAN. COME TOGETHER OR IS SOMEHOW GET SOMEBODY AMENDMENTS. I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION AND THAT'S BASED ON. A MEETING THAT WE HAD- WITH THAT LOCAL HEALTH PLANS. I KNOW THAT THE BILL IS ARAMBULA ON THE ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDON. AND SO I GUESS AT THIS POINT I WANT TO ASK YOU KNOW WHO HAS FINAL DECISION MAKING POWER IN HERE BECAUSE I THINK- I WAS- TOLD OR SHARED WITH MY OFFICE THAT. ARE YOU KNOW SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS IN CONCERT. FOR SURE WITH THAT MR ARAMBULA BUT THEY HAVEN'T NECESSARILY HAD A- QUALITY ENGAGEMENT SO IF YOU GUYS CAN AT LEAST EDUCATE ME ON. HOUSES INFORMATION GONNA BE CONVEYED AND HOW ARE OR THE FINAL DECISIONS. POINT TO BE MADE THAT WOULD BE GREAT THANK YOU. WHAT OF AGAIN- I WOULD JUST SAY AND THEN OUT OF. A TRADE MENTAL ALSO- AND- ALSO ANSWER A QUESTION IS AGAIN WHAT. THE REASON FOR THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING. AS WE WANTED TO HEAR FROM ALL OF YOU. YEAH YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO HEAR FROM THE STATE. TO HEAR YOUR- AND THEN- DEPENDING ON WHATEVER THAT WE CAN A CORPORATE THAT INTO- MOVING FORWARD SO WE'RE HEARING WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT. WELL THERE IS A LANGUAGE ON CERTAIN THINGS IT'S AN AGREEMENT THAT OF COURSE ALSO IT'S COMING BACK FOR THE DESTRUCTION AS WELL- WE FOR YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE LISTENING TO ALL THE THREE. POINTS BEFORE BRINGING UP AND THEN THAT CERTAINLY THAT MEANS OUR STAR STAFF KNOWS THAT THESE ARE CONCERNS OF THE COMMITTEE. AND WILL- AND TRY TO CORPORATE THAT WHETHER IT'S BUDGET TRAILER ORDERS THE RENTAL BILL COMES OVER. AND THAT'S BECOMES THE MAIN VEHICLE- SO ACTUALLY I TREATMENT. YEAH I WOULD JUST- WITH DOCTOR PAM THAT'S- AS- AS WE ALL KNOW WHEN WE SEE PROPOSALS COME OUT. AT LEARN ABOUT THE ONE IT REALLY IT IN THE P. WHICH IS THE BEST WAY FOR US TO LEARN ABOUT THINGS. BECAUSE IT MAKES US HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS WHEN WE LEARN ABOUT THINGS IN THE NEWSPAPER- AND WE CERTAINLY EXPRESSED OUR CONCERN EARLY ON I CERTAINLY DID. AND WE DID NOT JUST LET THIS FLY THROUGH THE BUDGET AS WELL AS- THE TEA. I THINK THE DESIRE- AND SO WE'VE BROUGHT IT BACK UP FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE THIS- DIDN'T THERE IS. THE YOU KNOW. ANYTIME THERE ARE. BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS WITH A WITH AN ENTITY IS LARGEST IN IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF VERY HIGH LEVEL NEGOTIATIONS PART OF THAT PART OF THAT PROCESS IS HEARING FROM ALL OF US RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW AND SO AND WE HAVE OUR BUDGET STAFF IN THE IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM WAS CAREFULLY TAKING NOTES- AND- CALL. WE AND WE WILL DO OUR BEST TO INCORPORATE EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE HEARD AND- AN ACT. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY SITTING HERE RIGHT NOW KNOWS THE FINAL END PRODUCT BECAUSE IT'S IT IS IN PROCESS. OR JUST FOR THAT ALONE I NEEDED THANK YOU I KNOW THAT A LOT OF TIMES WE GET IT. ALMOST LAST MINUTE SO I HAVE TO DO FOR THEM I THINK BOTH OF YOU FOR JUST EVEN BRING US TOGETHER I. LEARNED A LOT TODAY AND- THERE'S LIKE I SAID A LOT OF UNANSWERED QUESTIONS BUT UP. AT IT YOU WILL THAT OUR CONCERNS ARE EX WE HAVE DONE OUR VERY BEST TO MAKE THIS NOT JUST BE RUBBER STAMPED AND TO BRING IT. CAUGHT BACK IF YOU WILL TO MAKE SURE THE LEGISLATURE IS ABLE TO FULLY ENGAGE WITH THE PART WITH THE PROPOSAL. SERA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THIS WAS AN- IN THE- QUESTION ANSWER SEGMENT ON- IMHO USE BUT MANY OF A CERTAIN THESE DAYS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH CARE FOR- TO THE STATE INCLUDING ARMS SPECIFICALLY INCLUDING OUR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. SO WITH REGARD TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE SOMEONE SUGGEST THAT KAISER AT LEAST SOME PORTIONS IN SOME SEGMENTS OF KAISER'S STRUGGLED WITH PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH CARE FOR ITS ENROLLEES. CERTAINLY IN THE PAST SO IF THIS PROPOSAL OPTED WITH RESPECT TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE. WHAT HAPPENS THERE BUT IF I HEAR THE LOCAL PLANS CORRECTLY THEY'VE SUGGESTS THAT- SOME CARE PERHAPS MENTAL HEALTH CARE IS COVERED. THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATIVE FEE AND OTHERWISE WHEN THEY SUBCONTRACT. SERVICES TO CAPTURE FOR MEDIC SINCE WHEN THE SUBCONTRACT GOES AWAY. AND KAISER IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE THE FULL SCOPE OF MEDICAL BENEFITS WHAT HAPPENS IN THE MENTAL HEALTH ARENA. MAYBE I'LL START WITH- DIRECTOR BUS YES PLEASE. SO I WOULD DEFER TO MS COMMITMENT IN TERMS OF- IF PRIME PLANS ARE. CARBENE OUT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN TERMS OF THE RELATIONSHIP WITH KAISER THAT'S NOT MY UNDERSTANDING- BUT IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW KAISER'S COMMITMENT TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND YOUI THINK AS WE WILL HAVE A DIRECT OVERSIGHT OF KAISER AND THEIR UTILIZATION AND THEIR THEIR PROVISION OF SERVICES ON THE B. HERE ON SITE AND I THINK THAT THE ABILITY TO HAVE THAT DEREGULATION SHOULD WILL HELP US BE ABLE TO HOLD THEM MORE ACCOUNTABLE. AND I AGAIN WOULD KNOW THAT ALL OVER MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS CAN DO BETTER WITH REGARD TO THE PROVISION OF BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES AND THAT'S WHY WHEN IT'S ONE OF THE CLINICAL FOCUS AREAS FOR COMPREHENSIVE QUALITY STRATEGY- AND SO. THE FIRST TIME EVER WE WILL BE INCLUDING THAT IT'S RELATED TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ESPECIALLY SERVICES AS PART OF OUR QUALITY STRAP AND PART OF HOW WE WILL PAY OUT PLANS IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU AND THE DEMOCRATS WE ALSO DID LYNETTE COOKMAN ONE- ADDRESS THAT AS THE TWELFTH DISTRICT MENTIONED THAT IN TERMS OF WHAT THE- THAT'S. PROJECT IS A BIT DON'T SUBCONTRACT MENTAL HEALTH PORTION. I THINK YOU DOCTOR CAN OF OUR PLAN AT THE PUMP K. TODAY THAT CATER PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BUT THERE ARE SOME THAT THEY JUST DON'T PROVIDE AND THAT THE LOCAL PLANT AND- NEED TO STEP IN AND PROVIDE THOSE PROVIDER MEMBERS AND THE EXAMPLE THAT I HAVE HEARD IT FOR CERTAIN SERVICES RELATED EATING DISORDERS. OKAY OKAY THANK YOU AND THEN MY A AND ACTUALLY IF YOU DON'T MIND CENTAMIN YOU HAD A BRIEF COMMENT YOU WANTTO. I JUST WANT TO MAKE THE COMMENT THAT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT THEY DON'T ALWAYS HAVE SOME INPATIENT ACUTE IT IS WHICH I THINK THE DIRECTOR JUST REFER TO. THE BUT I GET THE THING I THINK WE ALL HERE IS A THERE THERE ARE NONE I'M NOT ENOUGH PROVIDERS AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT KAISER NOT HAVING ENOUGH PROVIDERS THEN I JUST THINK WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL THAT WE DON'T ENCOURAGE THEM TO POACH EVEN MORE FROM THE LOCAL PLANS JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE ABLE TO HAVE MORE PROVIDERS BECAUSE THEY'RE ABLE TO PAY A LOT MORE WORK. WE ARE MY OF MY NEXT AND HOPEFULLY FINAL QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH LOOKING READING THE MATERIAL AND I GUESS THIS GOES TO THE DIRECTOR TO CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS AND RE PROCUREMENT IN A RESTRUCTURED MANAGED CARE CONTRACTS A FOR THE MEDICAL SERVICES- POORLY PLANS ARE EXPECTED TO MEET OR EXCEED BENCHMARKS OR FACE SANCTIONS. IF LOCAL PLANS- ARE CURRENTLY CREDITED WITH THE LOWER ACUITY OF- KAISER MEDICARE PATIENTS BECAUSE OF THE SUBCONTRACTING ARRANGEMENT WHEN THAT SUBCONTRACTING ARRANGEMENT GOES AWAY. WHAT HAPPENS WITH RESPECT TO THE LOCAL PLANS VIS A VIS THIS NEWLY RESTRUCTURED MANAGED CARE CONTRACTS. CALL MET. THANK AND IS THERE SOME ADJUSTMENT FOR THAT. SO WE'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR WITH OUR COVERAGE OF QUALITY STRATEGY ON THE METRICS THAT PLANS WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO YOU AND THAT WILL FLY ACROSS ACROSS ALL DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND ACROSS THE ENTIRE CROSS THE STATE AND SO COME TWENTY TWENTY FOUR PLAYERS WILL KNOW WHAT WE WILL BE RIGHT. TWENTY TWENTY. WELL AS DIFFERENT QUALITY CARE TARGET HELP BENEFICIARIES RECOGNIZING THAT- YOU KNOW WE'RE GIVING THEM SOME TIME TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THESE METRICS ARE AND THAT WE WANT TO REFLECT HOW WEAK WE ENGAGE WITH OUR PLANS AND HOW WE PAY OUR PLANTS IN TERMS OF THE QUALITY. AND EXPECTATIONS WE EXPECT FOR OUR MEDICARE. WELL OF COURSE YOU KNOW KAISER. IF IN FACT BECAUSE YOU PATIENTS ARE LOWER CUTIE HEALTHIER PATIENTS AND WE SHIP FROM A SUBCONTRACTING- TO ACCOUNT DIRECT CONTRACTING MODEL IN THE LIGHT SWITCH IS FLIPPED. THAT CHANGES IMMEDIATE DOES THAT ALSO MEAN THAT THERE IS AN IMMEDIATE CHANGE FOR THE LOCAL PLANS AND HOW WITH THE LOCAL PLANS BE ABLE TO. TRANSITION IF THE IMPLEMENTATION IS. FOR EXAMPLE AND ARE THEY IN FACT LEFT IN THIS CASE WITH SICKER PATIENTS WHICH COULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR I GUESS IN YOUR RISK ADJUSTED CAPITATION PAYMENT BUT IF THEY'RE BUILT QUALITY BENCHMARKS THAT HAVE TO BE MET BY THE LOCAL PLANS WITHOUT CREDIT FOR THE CASE YOUR PATIENCE ISN'T THAT GOING TO HAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT IF THEIR SANCTIONS IT RESULT FOR FAILURE TO MEET BENCHMARKS REGARDLESS OF THE MONEY THAT THEY GET IN THE RISK ADJUSTED CAPITATION AM I MAKING SENSE I'M A LITTLE OUT OF MY SANDBOX HERE BUT- EVEN IN ALL OF THESE CHANGES ARE VERGE. TWENTY FOUR BUT I WILL I TURN IT OVER TO AT. COOPER OUR STATE MEDICAID DIRECTOR AND CHIEF DEPUTY JUST TO GET IS THAT YOU CAN GET INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THE TECHNICAL DETAILS THANK YOU MA'AM- JESSICA. EAGLE YES HI. I'M SO AND I'LL START WITH THE RATES AND THEN I WILL MOVE OVER INTO THAT THE QUALITY SUPPORT SO- WE WOULD BE ADJUSTING BOTH THE LOCAL PLANS AND KAISER IN REGARDS THE IMPACT ON MEMBERSHIP WILL ACCOUNT FOR MEMBERSHIP- SHIFTS- AND- THE YOU KNOW WHEN. OF WHO A QUOTE AT OF A- SO DELEGATE TO. OUR ROOM. FROM THE DRAFT IN ALL- THE GLOBAL KIND OF KAPPA. BECAUSE FOR THE NUMBERS WILL ALSO BE FOR. I THOUGHT WE'D BE A TAKING ACCOUNT FOR THAT I'M IN THOSE TWO. AND WE HAVE ALL OF THAT INFORMATION AND DATA. FROM OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS TODAY ALL THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE SAME THING ON THE RISK ADJUSTMENT SIDE WE WOULD BE- ANTICIPATING- THAT MOVIE WOULD BE. RE ADJUSTING THE CALCULATION. BASED ON THE RISK ADJUSTMENT AND WE ARE HAVING EXTENSIVE CONVERSATIONS EVEN OUTSIDE OF THIS HI THERE. A CONVERSATION WITH THE MANAGED CARE PLANS IN REGARDS TO HOW WE- GET TO THAT RISK ADJUSTMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS. A ADEQUATELY ADJUSTING FOR. ACROSS THE VARIOUS PIECES WHEN. IT COMES TO THE- WORST BUT YES TO BE WOULD BE AS WE WOULD BE GETTING. SCHOOL PLEASE FOR ALL THEIR TWO K. ONCE THEY AND WHY IN THE TEN NEW COUNTY BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE TO HAVE A START NUMBER OF LIVES FOR. IN QUALITY MEASURES I DO. AN ALBUM. REQUIREMENTS BUT THOSE WOULD BE REPORTED DIRECTLY- AND THEN DID QUALITY SCORES THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING RECORDED SO I'VE HAD A VERY HIGH QUALITY SCORES AS- INDICATED BY THEM EARLIER. I MEAN BY DEMONSTRATED ON OUR QUALITY OF REPORTS ONLINE. BUT THOSE WOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE LOCAL PLAN. IN THIS WOULD BE DIRECTLY ORIENTED JUST TO KAISER AND THEREFORE A DEPENDING ON HOW THOSE BOARDS ON AVERAGE HITTING OF THE LOCAL PLANS- THEY COULD SEE A DECREASE- REGARDLESS OF THAT THE- PLAN WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR. ALL OF THE LIVES THAT THEY'RE UNDER THE QUALITY SCORES AND IF THEY ARE BELOW A CERTAIN LEVEL I WOULD BE HOLDING THE MANAGED CARE PLAN ACCOUNTABLE. FOR THE QUALITY SCORES OF THE DAY ARE SUBMITTING TO THE DEPARTMENT WHICH CAN RESULT IN CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN OR SANCTION. DEPENDING ON WHAT WE ARE ARE ARE TALKING ABOUT- IT pLOCAL PLANTS DO YOU HAVE A SEAT BENEFIT FROM. THE KAISER QUALITY SCORES BECAUSE OF THEY ARE AND HOW HIGH THEY ARE. CONTINUE TO WORK WITH- PLANS. IN REGARDS TO THAT **** TRACTION OF THE KAISER PATIENTS. KAISER RECEIVES NO ADVERSE IMPACT OF COURSE BECAUSE OF PREVENTATIVE CARE AND THE WAY THEY'VE DESIGNED KAISER'S PROGRAM. LOCAL PLANS HAVE BEEN BENEFITING FROM THE KAISER PATIENTS BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN THE PRIME CONTRACTOR. SUBCONTRACTING TO KAISER WE'RE GOING TO REMOVE THAT THE LIGHT SWITCH GETS FLIPPED OFF. THE QUALITY MEASURE SCORES GO INTO THE TANK. AND WHAT. WHAT'S THE TRANSITION PLAN FOR THE LOCAL PLANS. IN OTHER WORDS TAKE IT TO TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT AND TO GIVE THE LOCAL PLANTS THE OPPORTUNITY. TO SOME HELP IMPROVE BUT QUALITY IMPROVE QUALITY MEASURES AND PERFORMANCE VIS A VIS THE BENCHMARKS THAT ARE SET AND FRANKLY FROM OF NOTHING'S FAIR CERTAINLY NOT IN SACRAMENTO AND CERTAINLY NOT UNDER THE DOME BUT I THINK WE NEED TO APPLY SOME FAIRNESS MEASURE TO THIS AND HAVE SOME SPOOL UP OF THIS PARTICULAR ASPECT OF THE PROPOSAL IN ORDER TO GIVE LOCAL PLANS THE ABILITY TO MEET THE TEST. AND IF YOU KNOW IF THIS PROPOSAL GOES UNITS INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY ONE OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE WERE JULY ONE OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE THAT'S PROBABLY ENOUGH TIME NOT ENOUGH TIME RATHER NOT ENOUGH TIME TO TURN THE TITANIC HERE SITES I WOULD JUST POINT OUT ONE THING ALSO SO- IT WOULD BE ONE IT UP FOR JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY FOUR TO THAT LEVEL MORE TIME TWO THINGS THE LOCAL PLANTS CURRENTLY NO I WHAT THEIR QUALITY SCORES ARE WITH AND WITHOUT HEISER TODAY SO THAT WOULD HAVE THE INFORMATION TO BE ABLE TO- TO WORK TOWARD SOME OF THOSE- IMPROVEMENTS I THINK. OF THE THING I WOULD SAY IS HI THERE COULD ALSO BE A SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED RIGHT NOW THEY ALSO FOUGHT SUBMIT ALL THEIR SCORES AND WHILE THEY ARE A HIGH SCORE IN CERTAIN MEASURES AND METRICS WITH THE DEPARTMENT THEY COULD BE UNDER A CERTAIN THRESHOLD- NOW THAT THEY ARE THEN DIRECTLY CONTRACTED WITH AT THE STATE. MEASURES. ENTER ACCOUNTABLE ALL- IF THEY ARE LOW IN SEARCH MEASURE BUT THE LAW THE FIFTY FOR. WE WILL ALSO BE A DAY WOULD BE EXPOSED NEW CRAP ACTION AND- SAYING. IMMEDIATELY I JUST LIKE ANY OF OUR OTHER DIRECT CONTRACTORS AREN'T THEY ALSO GET THE BENEFIT WITH ARE NOT EXCEEDING UNDER THE SUBCONTRACT BECAUSE WE HOLD THE PRIVATE PLAN. A GLOBAL SO IT GOES BOTH WAYS I THINK YOUR POINT IS NOTED IN REGARDS TO THE TRANSITION AND HOW WE ARE FACTORED THOSE THINGS IN. A TO ALLOW FOR ALL INTO T. UNDERSTOOD FORWARD WELL I. WELL I THINK IT'S LIKE THAT USED TO BE IS ADVERSELY IMPACTED AS A LOCAL PLANS ARE I GUESS IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT KAISER WILL ALSO SUFFER SOME ADVERSE IMPACTS WELL INCLUDE KAISER IN MY- IN MY REQUEST IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WHEN WE'RE IMPOSING A CHANGE LIKE THIS. IT CAN BE SIGNIFICANT AND MY ONLY CONTEXT IS HAVING BEEN ON HOSPITAL BOARDS WHERE WE'VE DEALT WITH QUALITY MANAGEMENT BENCHMARKS AND PERFORMANCE AND CERTAINLY FROM THE SEVERAL HOSPITALS AND I'VE- BEEN INVOLVED WITH IT IT'S IT DOESN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT TO GO FROM RED TO GREEN. AND SO MY QUESTION IS HOW MUCH TIME YOU GIVING LOCAL PLANS AND I'LL INCLUDE KAISER IN THE STATEMENT. TO IMPROVE TO GO FROM RED TO GREEN IN THE CERTAIN AREAS AND I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE JANUARY ONE OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FOUR FOR JUST TALKING ABOUT IT TODAY THE FACT THAT PLANS ARE ABLE TO SEPARATE OUT. THE NON KAISER PATIENTS. WHEN IT COMES TO QUALITY. IMPROVEMENT BENCHMARKS IN THE PROCESS DOESN'T REALLY DO IT. FOR ME. SO I'M ASKING I GUESS YOU AND WE WILL DECIDED HERE TODAY. THE WHEN WE'RE MOVING THIS PROPOSAL FORWARD THAT WE GIVE SOME THOUGHT. AT LEAST IN THIS AREA TO PROVIDING. SOME STRING. ON THE LOCAL PLANS ENCOURAGE YOUR TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THIS NEW THE RECONFIGURED- MANAGED CARE CONTRACT AND THE PROPOSALS RELATED TO QUALITY AND BENCHING BACK IN THINK THROUGH HOW WE CAN DO THAT WE WOULD ALSO NEED TO CONSULT WITH OUR ALLIES CMS POTENTIALLY AS WELL YOU KNOW THEY HAVE BROUGHT EXPECTATIONS IN REGARDS TO TRANSPARENCY AROUND THESE THINGS AND OFTENTIMES. A DELEGATION AS WERE FAIRLY TALKING ABOUT THAT STATE CAN IN BOTH WAYS JUST TO BE CLEAR- NOT ALWAYS PAINT THE FULL PICTURE OF THE DIFFERENT PIECES BUT WE WILL DEFINITELY TAKE THAT BACK UNDER CONSIDERATION. IN REGARDS TO HOW DO WE HAVE A SMOOTH TRANSITION OF BROADLY WITH THE MANAGED CARE PROCUREMENT WE ARE DOING A LOT OF FOCUS GROUPS AROUND HOW DO WE DO THAT MAKE A TRANSITION WILL DEFINITELY TAKE THIS UNDER CONSIDERATION TO ENSURE THAT WE TAKE ALL THESE FACTORS. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR PUTTING UP WITH ME APPRECIATED THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU APPRECIATE AND- NOW IT'S MY TURN TO ASK QUESTIONS OF I WOULD MAKE NOTE- CENTER UP A FAVORITE FEATURE WHAT- YOU YOU BRING UP ALTHOUGH I WOULD ALSO MENTION THAT- I REMEMBER BRING UP QUALITY MEASURES FOR. MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS A DECADE AGO AS CHAIRED THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE SO I'LL JUST MENTION THAT THEY HAD A DECADE TO FIX IT AND- SO THEY HAD PLENTY OF TIME- BUT ANYWAY. WELL THE THAT THAT BUT I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IF YOU TAKE THE KAISER OUT HOW THAT MIGHT AFFECT AND THE PLANS. IN TERMS OF THEIR OVERALL RATING AND ALSO FOR KAISER ITSELF BECAUSE NOW THEY'RE PICKING UP A PIECE THAT MAYBE THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO DO IS A SUBCONTRACT- SO THE QUESTION SO I HAVE CITY SEVERAL QUESTIONS- THE- THAT I CLARIFIED REALLY- PABLO THE TEACHER AND RECTIFY WITHOUT IMPACTS ON CONVERSE I ALSO MET KAISER. AND ALSO MET WITH THE LOCAL HEALTH PLANS AS WELL ABOUT THEIR CONCERNS- AND IT ALSO NOTE THAT I REPRESENT TO COUNTIES ONE IS- SACRAMENTO COUNTY. MANAGED CARE SO THERE IS A KAISER DIRECTOR THE GUY CONTRACT WITH KAISER IS DIRECTLY CONTRACT WITH THE STATE. FOR THAT- SO- READY HAVE THAT IN MIND AND ONE COUNTY AND THE OTHER IS ACTUALLY BECAUSE COUNTY- WITH PARTNERSHIP HEALTH PLAN- YELLOW COUNTY- SO WHICH- SO CERTAINLY HEARING IT FOR US. I HAVE A CEMEX ON ON SERVICE TO ENDS OF- A MEDIC CAL IN TERMS OF- CONTRACTING HEALTH PLANS. SO THE FIRST CUT IS THE QUESTIONS I HAVE THIS REGARDS ACTUALLY- THE- RATE SETTING AND RISK ADJUSTMENT SO I DO NOT START WITH THE LOCAL HEALTH PLANS SO. MEN YOU TESTIFIED HERE TODAY ARE LEAST UP AND THEN I FORGOT WHO THE OTHER PERSON YOU BROUGHT ON FROM YOUR TEAM- THAT. THE DHS DOES DO RISK ADJUSTMENT BUT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE VERY CRITICAL OF THE RISK ADJUSTMENT METHODOLOGY AND YOU YOU DID MENTION THAT THERE WERE PROTECT THIS PARTICULAR LANGUAGE YOU YOU ARE SUGGESTING. REGARD THAT SEEM TO ADDRESS RISKY JOB. THE POSTMAN MEDS- IN AN ANSWER THAT YOU GAVE TO WHAT MIGHT ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. CAN YOU PERHAPS GIVE US A HIGH LEVEL DESCRIPTION OF EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANT IT IS AND WHAT IS WHAT IS THE ISSUE WITH THE WAY TO THE ATS CURRENTLY DOES RISK ADJUSTMENT THAT CONCERNS YOU. ARE THAT YOU SAY IS NOT ACCURATE TO OUR DOESN'T- I DON'T THE WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH BUT SOUNDS LIKE IT DID NOT THE YET CONCERT THAT BASICALLY SAID THE WAY THAT DETAILS CURRENTLY DOES RISK ADJUSTMENT DOESN'T ACTUALLY- WELL. IT IS. A INFILL WAS WAS PARTICULARLY ACCURATE I GUESS IF I'M USING THE RIGHT WORDS SO KEEP KEEP PLEASE ADDRESS THAT. THANK THANK YOU FOR THE BEST CENTER PAN AND I WILL AND ASK MY COLLEAGUE JENNIFER LOPEZ. TWO LANES HERE AS WELL THANK YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION AROUND OUR AMENDMENTS AND HOW IT ADDRESSED THE ISSUE- YOU'RE RIGHT IN CHARACTERIZING- YEAH BY TESTIMONY IN RESPONSE THAT. WE BELIEVE THAT THE RISK ADJUSTMENT METHODOLOGY CURRENTLY USED BY THE DEPARTMENT. IS FLAWED. IN THAT IT DOESN'T ADEQUATELY ADDRESS RATE FOR THE HIGHEST NEED. NOR THE LOWEST NEEDS MEMBERS. EACH DAY. THING I DOLLARS OCCURRING. THAT WOULD BE EXACTLY BY THE PROPOSAL IF THOSE ISSUES ARE NOT ADDRESSED. GEN CONFIG MORE TO THAT. BUT THERE ARE AT IN LIFE. I'M HERE AT FOR A CROSS. AND THEN I TIMELINE. FOR DEEP YEAH TO ADDRESS ISSUES THERE ARE TECHNICAL WORK THAT WE INCLUDE. YEAH IN OUR. A WELL IT'S MEMBERS AND SOME OF THE OTHER THAT BEEN YES LONG PAIN POINTS ARE ALSO DIRECT RELATED TO THIS BUT I WANT TO ADD ASK JENNIFER LOPEZ- LAPD'S DIRECTOR CALL AND FINE THE TOP A BIT ABOUT MORE ABOUT RISK ADJUSTMENT AND AN ORCHESTRA OKAY. JENNIFER LOPEZ PLEASE. HI THERE SO I KNOW I ON THE RISKY SOFTWARE THAT ISSUES RELATED THIS IS A TO THE TAIL THING YOU'RE HOW FOLK AND- BRITAIN'S HERE YOUR HIGH ME- YOU'RE GONNA AT YOU FULL REFUND OF THE HELL. AND UNDER FUNDING OF THE MOST FRAIL AND YOU KNOW THIS IS A SUPPORTED BY STUDY THAT WITH BY THE SOCIETY ENACT ON ACTOR ON AVERAGE COULD NOT. SO ARE. EIGHT BROMATE RULES FORTH IN THE PROPOSAL AND BY PRODUCT DISCUSS WILL SERVE HEALTH POP. REALLY HAVE A HIGHER PER. OF A HEALTHIER MEMBER SINCE THE THESE UNDER FIVE. THAT MEANS HI WOULD A- GREAT SETTING AND WE WOULD SITTING YEAH. OKAY SAYS CERTAIN THAT. APPRECIATE THAT MAYBE I'M GONNA YELL INTO THE WEEDS LITTLE TECHNICAL. BECAUSE YOU TELL ME ABOUT EPIC OF THAT BUT THAT THE HSS AT IT IS THAT UP TO RECENTLY IS USING A RISK ADJUSTMENT DOLLARS G. BASED ON I THINK PHARMACY USE. BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE MOVING BEYOND THAT AND USING A MORE SOPHISTICATED FORM RISK ASSESSMENT DATA RATES OTHER DATA LEFT DIAGNOSES AND SO FORTH. ARE YOU REFERRING TO THEIR CURRENT THAT PREVIOUS RISK ADJUSTMENT ARE YOU ALSO REFERRING TO- THERE THE FUTURE ADJUSTMENT METHOD. THAT THE STATE. THE DAILY WITH- YES WITHOUT IT WOULD BE MORE ACCURATE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION I AMBER TO BOTH THE FAR READ ADJUSTMENT INCOME OR ACT- WHICH IS DEVELOPED BY SEE DIEGO AND THEY THE MOVE IN CALENDAR YEAR TWO THREE BE TO. EIGHTEEN PLANTS ARE AT WHICH HE POINT AND I DIAGNOSTIC CODE BOTH OF THE MODELS HAVE THIS AND THAT IS BAY FROM STUDY- AS POINTED OUT BY THE AN ACTUAL WAY. OVER FIVE HEALTHIER HER UNDER FIVE THANK. AN ISSUE WITH YOU HAPPEN JUST FOR. SHARE THANK BEING BY SINGLE OKAY AND THE LEAVE THAT THAT IS THAT IS IT SINCE. THE ISSUE AND THE CONCERN OKAY HI DON'T SERVE HOW. AND MORE MONEY THAT YOU CANNOT GET THAT IS OUR TIME AND GETS I GET SO HAVE THE BUT SO. A GUESS MY OTHER THAN MY FATHER UP QUESTION IS TE- IS THERE A SOLUTION TO THIS YOU A ARE YOU ARE YOU JUST. IT'S SO YOU KNOW YOU'RE ME THAT IT'S NOT GOOD AT TALESE'S IS THERE A RISK. METHODOLOGY THAT- YOU IT ALL INTERNET YOU WANT TO GO THAT WOULDN'T HAVE THE PROBLEM YOU AS A- RISK. METHODOLOGY IS HOW THIS PROBLEM. I THINK I WOULD SAY THAT THE CAKE CAL. MEDICAID BECAUSE ANOTHER. TO COUNTY REGIONAL STARTING VERY NOT A- DIFFERENT BASED ON THE NUMBER MIX. FROM TO PLAN. IT'S REALLY. SPECIFIC ISSUE. WE HAVE FORTY NINE. I'M DATING COOPER ENDED THAT AND HER CAST. THAT HAD BEEN KEPT. RECOMMENDATIONS HOW CORRECT THE NOT UTILIZED OR ISSUE. WE ARE WE TO HEAR FROM THE STATE LOOK FOR TO HAVING THOSE THE FACTIONS. REGARDING THE HOW YOU RIGHT- THERE ARE A VARIETY OF. THAT CAN BE EMPLOYED THAT COULD BE AND YOU ATTENTION AND MAKE A RISK ADJUSTMENT REALLY OFFICE REDEVELOPMENT SMART. FOREST PRODUCTS SOMETHING LIKE A HIGH. FOR HI BUILDER BUT GET. RATE SETTING COMPLEX AND- WITH THAT AT ALL. IT IS. WHERE DID YOU MEET HOW FOR UNLIKE OTHER MEN THE STATE HAS DESPERATE SHE OF THE MAY. THAT COURAGE FROM PLAN TO PLAN WE CAN METHODOLOGY THAT WE WOULD ACCEPT I THINK WE KNOWLEDGE THAT NO SINGLE METHODOLOGY IS GOING TO BE A 100% ACCURATE BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT IS COMMON PRACTICE. TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THAT THE CORRECT FOR FLOOD AND THAT IS WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR OKAY ALL RIGHT THAT THAT'S HELPFUL TO KNOW I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT CALIFORNIA'S A FAIRLY LARGE STATE SO WE'RE THE MOST POPULOUS IN THE COUNTRY FOR I THINK WE HAVE THE LARGEST MEDICAID POPULATION OF ANY- ANY STATE- AND SO. IN SOME WAYS AT LEAST WE HAVE BIG NUMBERS ON OUR SIDE TERMS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE CORRECTIONS AND SO FORTH- MAYBE OUT THERE AND- ALSO NOW ASK. WELL MAYBE I'LL ASK A DCS TO RESPOND I DON'T KNOW SIR I DO SEE COOPER WANTS ME TO ONCE IT'S MORE TECHNICAL QUESTION VERSES ARE DIRECTOR WILL SAVE HER FROM HAVING TO ANSWER THIS TECHNICAL QUESTIONS SO. J. C. I GUESS YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT STUCK WITH ANSWERING THE TECHNICAL QUESTION ON METRIC METHODOLOGY. ADJUSTMENT YOU IN ORDER. AND ARE PAN AM AS SO YOU BUT I WOULD SAY IS. WE ARE CONTINUE CONVERSE. WITH PLAINTIFFS WE HAVE HAD- A- DAY THIS. WITH ALL OF THAT. OTHER LOCAL HEALTH PLANS THIS YEAR THAT THEY HAVE ASKED HER TO READ. YOU YOUR CONTINUE TO IN. IN I MISS LOPEZ. REGARDS TO OUR CURRENT MESSAGE. ON MEDICARE AXIS CORRECTING THEM BUT WE ARE CURRENTLY PROPOSING. AND WE'VE HAD MANY DISCUSSIONS WITH THE PLANS IN REGARDS TO THAT. BUT IT ALSO SAY IS THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT A QUALITY- IT WITHIN THE RATE YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE UTILIZATION SCORES- AND WE ARE LOOKING AT- SAFETY NET. YES- YOU KNOW IN IN YOU KNOW INVESTMENT PIECES. ARE ON THE TABLE ALL. WE ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGING WITH- MANY THINGS THAT ARE IN THEIR COURT% REGARDS TO GETTING BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT ALSO FOR THESE CONSIDERATION IN PIECES. BUT ALSO SAY IS WE ARE ALSO USING A BROAD ASSUMPTIONS THAT WILL BE APPLIED ACROSS ALL PLANS WE ARE. LOOKING PASSED. I'M MAKING THIS WORK FOR ONLY LOCAL. PLANS ARE. YEP ROB- ACTUAR- APPROPRIATE ADJUST WITHIN OUR RATES- THAT CAN BE A- BY BOTH CMS. AND THAT CAN ASSERT- IN OFTEN. SEEN THAT ESPECIALLY WITH SOME OF THE UTILIZATION PROPOSALS BEING PART THERE'S NOT AN ACTUAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LOCAL PLANTS IN THEIR COMMERCIAL PLANTS. IT IT BURIES A CROSS OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS WE'RE TRYING TO WORK TOGETHER BROADLY AT TO FIND A WAY TO. APPROPRIATELY ADJUST BY QB WE THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT. WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE BUILDING IN. A FOR HIRE CUTIE. COPULATION THAT THAT WILL TAKE MORE WORK ON QUALITY THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE'VE ALSO SHARED WITH THE LOCAL PLANS. IN REGARDS TO HOW WE WANT TO MAKE THESE ADJUSTMENTS BECAUSE WE KNOW WITH THE HIGHER QB POPULATION. ACHIEVING EQUALITY SCORES IS CHECK MORE CHALLENGING AND WE ARE MAKING. A DOES IT. MEAN THOSE RESERVATIONS WITH THEM SO I THINK. THE DEPARTMENT IS VERY COMMITTED TO. MAKING SURE THAT THE X. YOU DID JUST MENTION THE RISK ADJUSTMENTS WITHIN OUR RATE SETTING IS APPROPRIATE. AS YOU CLEARLY HEARD- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ALL MEDICAID UP PLANS TO HAVE TO JUST FOR WHAT I WOULD JUST SAY IS CALIFORNIA'S NOT. HI MEDICAID OTHER MANY OTHER STATES THE DO AS WELL- SO JUST POINT THAT OUT AND AT HIGHS ARE SMALL IT'S A SIMILAR ACROSS ON THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS WHEN WE LOOKING AT OUR STAFF AND SAN DIEGO COUNTIES WHERE HI THERE IS A DIRECT CONTRACTOR TODAY HI THERE'S BEEN PER SHIP IS PROJECTED TO BE HIGHER RISK THAN THE COUNTY AVERAGE FOR CHILDREN AND ADULT POPULATIONS AND THEIR COUNTERPARTS BUT I WOULD KNOW THEIR LOWER RISK FOR SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES SO WE ARE DEFINITELY LOOKING AT. ALL YES THERE'S A- WE- APPROPRIATELY THOSE IN THE WAY ARE. RAY IN THE FUTURE IN ADJUSTING. THOSE PARTICULAR PIECES YEAH WELL I APPRECIATE THAT- AND- YOU ALSO WANNA COURAGE THE DEPARTMENT THAT LOCAL HEALTH PLANS TO CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER ON RISK ADJUSTMENT I MEAN ULTIMATELY. EIGHT I WILL TALK ABOUT KAISER CONTRACT I THINK IT'S MANY LIKE IS THAT THIS ISN'T MUCH ABOUT THE SPECIFIC PLANS WANT THAT WHATEVER PLANS ARE BEING TREATED FAIRLY THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THE PATIENTS RIGHT. THAT WE'RE NOT HAVING THESE. AVERTED PLANNED- THIS IS- THAT TAKES CARE OF A LOWER JUDY SAID AND- AND- AND HIS STUFF. UP BUT THIS IS GETTING DISPROPORTION ABOUT OF THE FUNDING AND THEREFORE DISADVANTAGING- NO SICKER PATIENTS SO- IT IN MY IN MY MIND. BE SURE THAT WE HAVE AN APPROPRIATE- DISTRIBUTION L. RACE RISK ADJUSTMENT IS GONNA BE REALLY IMPORTANT AND- I KNOW THAT DEPARTMENTS AS ARE WORKING ON IT. I HEAR FOR THE LOCAL HEALTH PLAN SAID. IF THERE IS A YOU KNOW DISTORTION AT THE TAILS- AND VOTE IS IF WHAT WE CAN TRY TO CORRECT FOR. BUT HOLDEN AND- BUT CERTAIN DOES INDICATE. THAT- GIVEN SOME OF THE RESTRICTIONS ON WHO CAN ROLL THE KAISER KAISER PERHAPS AND ALSO HISTORY. THAT KAISER PERHAPS WOULD HAVE A HEALTHIER POTENTIALLY HEALTHIER POPULATION IN THE END WE WANNA BE SURE THAT ANY PLAN WHETHER IT'S KAISER. AS A THROUGH STATEWIDE CONTRACTOR LOCAL HEALTH PLANS. GETS APPROPRIATE RISK ADJUSTMENT SO THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO GET OUR PATIENTS- THE- SO DOES FOLLOWS ON TO A RATE SETTING- SO WHEN THE QUESTION SO OF COURSE WE'RE MOVING TO REGIONAL RATE SETTING HUNDRED A NEW PROCUREMENT. RIGHT SO IN TERMS IT. IS GONNA STATEWIDE CONTRACT DIRECTLY AND NOT UNDER THIS PROPOSAL. SO IN TERMS OF THE RATE THAT KAISER GETS PAID IS THAT LIKE A SIMULATION OF THE- VARIOUS LOCAL WITH A RISK ADJUSTMENT VENTURA- THAT JUST.-HOURS AT A STATEWIDE SAME RATE ACROSS THE WHOLE STATE BECAUSE- EACH LOCAL HEALTH PLAN. IS HAVE YOU KNOW GONE HAVE THEIR RATES SET BASED ON WHERE THEY ARE IF THE LOCALITY IN. WHICH REGION THERE IN BECAUSE OUR STATEWIDE SO HOW ARE YOU UNDETERMINED. RATE IS IT GOING TO BE. BUILT WELL I GUESS ONE COULD ARGUE THAT IF THEY JUST GET ONE STATEWIDE RATE THAT'S NOT QUITE THE SAME AS- SAYING THAT WELL ACTUALLY YOUR RATES CAN BE BASED ON YOU HAVE X. NUMBER OF ENROLLEES IN THIS AREA IN THIS REGION AND THAT'S REGIONALLY IN THIS AREA AND THAT'S A THREE GENERATION CELLS. SO IN CASE YOU HAVE A SHIFT AND- AND WHERE YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR PATIENTS ARE SO FORTH THAT SHOULD BE REFLECTED IN THE ULTIMATE AND READY TO GET PAID. POLICE FOR THAT LOCAL ANOTHER. STATEWIDE CONTRACT IS A GONNA HAVE ESSENTIALLY SUB RATES BASED ON YOUR REGIONAL RATES AND THE NUMBER FOR LEASE IN EACH REGION. VERSUS A ONE STATEWIDE RATE WHICH COULD TURN OUT TO BE ADVANTAGES FOR CERTAIN REGIONS. MAYBE THIS ADVANTAGES IN OTHER REGIONS SO CAN YOU TO SERVE- PERHAPS- CLARIFY HOW RATES ARE GOING TO BE SET. AND PARTICULARLY OUR RATES COULD BE SET FOR KAISER WHICH IS GOING TO HAVE A STATE WIDE CONTRACT THE ONLY PLAN WITH STATEWIDE CONTRACT. THE WHAT I WOULD SAY. IS THAT WE HAVE A HANDFUL OF. YOU KNOW. HEALTH PLANS WHO HAVE. A BLUEPRINT IN MULTIPLE COUNTIES I THINK THE HELP THAT ARE TODAY FOR EXAMPLE. THIRTY TWO. OR THIRTY THREE COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- I- I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD NEED TO. CONSULT WITH OUR OUR OUR RATES TEAM SPECIFICALLY IN REGARD TO WHAT WE'RE THINKING FOR THE CHANGE OF WHERE WE HAVE THE FIVE DIRECT. AND I KNOW THERE'S STILL A LOT OF I THINK YOU'RE GOING AND WHAT I WOULD SAY THOUGH. ON WHETHER WE HAVE- YOU KNOW TO. AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA. WORK I WITH BE FACTORED IN AND THEIR MAKE YOU FEEL YOU TALK ABOUT BEFORE THERE'S ALWAYS BASE RATE AND THEN THERE'S TO BE LOCAL ADJUSTMENTS IN REGARDS TO HOW WE DO IT AFTER IN THOSE REGIONAL FACTORS AND THAT WILL STILL COME INTO PLAY HERE THE OTHER THING I WOULD PUT THAT CAPITATION RATES ARE BASED ON GROUPS OF Y. KIKO CORRECT- WHICH WE WILL. YOU KNOW RATE CELL THAT I WANNA GET TO TECHNICAL BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT'S HELPFUL FOR THE PURPOSES YEAR BUT REALLY NEAT WE BUILD THE RATES BASED OFF OF FOR EXAMPLE THE FOLLOWING ACCUSATIONS WILL HAVE CHILDREN WILL HAVE THE DOGS WILL HAVE THE EXPANSION SPVS S. B. DUAL LONG TERM CARE SO WE ARE ALREADY BREAKING DOWN RATES YOU. FOR A. I'M AS WE CONTINUE TO CUT BUILD OUT THAT ARE REGIONAL. GREAT THAT HE PROCESS WE WILL MAKING A NUMBER OF IT JUST. IN REGARDS TO HOW FACT. HI INTO. A THOSE RATES ARE OVER. IS WELL AS WE BE DOING WITH KIND OF. ALL OF OUR- THREE BEINGS- IN. WE ARE FORWARD WITH REGIONAL RATE SETTING IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. YEAH AND I THINK FOR PURPOSE OF FAIRNESS AND ABOUT GETTING INTO ALL THE COMPLEXITY ADDITION FOR THE CELLS THAT THEIR PRICE ON GEOGRAPHICALLY ELECTED. REFLECTION OF WHICH- THE AGHA FEES. THEIR ROLE LEASE ARE AND RIGHT BECAUSE OTHERWISE LATER. IF YOU DON'T THAT ISN'T REFLECTED BANDIT YOU KNOW THE PLAN COULD BE POTENTIALLY ADVANTAGE OR EVEN DISADVANTAGED ACTUALLY. MANY ON THE- YOU'VE ESTABLISHED OTHER ARE NOW. FACING THEIR RATES ON- VERSES- YEAH KAISER BEING BASS ON A- THAT YOU KNOW THAT SET OF. ARE SO FORTH SO- IT JUST JUST ONE YOU MENTIONED THAT- THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS- ACTUALLY. ONE OF THE PARTS OF THE PROPOSAL IS WELL ACTUALLY I JUST GOT IT COUNTY MO YOU SELL. YOUR REQUIRING AT KAISER OF A AND WILL YOU WITH EVERY COUNTY AND REALLY APPRECIATE AGAIN THE DESCRIPTION OF THAT- BECAUSE THIS IS THE- AND AGAIN. THIS IS WHAT. WE ARE EIGHT THAT. DTS OF DIRECTLY HOLD THE CONTRACT FOR EVERY SINGLE HEALTH PLAN DIRECTLY WITH THE STATE SO I JUST THE DOUBT. WE KNOW THAT. IN TIME- IN TERMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR SO IT'S AN L. KAISER AND ALSO EVERY OTHER HEALTH PLAN SO HAS HAS A- YOU WITH THE COUNTY. WHO HOLDS THE PLAN INCLUDING KAISER WHICH NOW HAS A STATEWIDE CONTRACT. ACCOUNTABLE FOR FOLLOWING THEM TO YOU AND IF THEY DON'T FOLLOW THE MO YOU. DOES IT IS IT GOING TO HAVE TO BE DH CS THAT. THOSE THAT THE DAY OF THE DAY COUNTY HAS APPEALED TO DHS FOR CONSEQUENCES ORDERS TO COUNTY IT WITHIN EMMA USER TO COUNTIES ALLOWED TO HAVE ANY- I GUESS AND LOCAL AUTHORITY BUT- RECOURSE TO ADDRESSING IF THERE IF THE ABLE YOU IS NOT FOLLOWED- SO- CONTINUED K. DRESS THAT SO GREATTHEY DON'T COME UP WITH THE NUMBER YOU. ETCETERA BUT OF COURSE WE KNOW ANIMAL USE JUST THE STARTING POINT AND THEN THE QUESTIONS THE PEOPLE FOLLOW SOMEONE DOESN'T FOLLOW THROUGH ON WHAT'S WHAT THEY AGREE TO ANY OF THE YOU. AND WHO WHO WHO WHO CAN HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. PART WOULD HOLD. THAT THE HEALTH OF KERR ARE. CANNIBAL FOR ME THAT COULD OF THE CONTRACT AND THAT INCLUDES AND DEMO USING THOSE ML USE WE WILL HAVE KIND OF THE OF THE PARAMETERS OF WHAT SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THOSE AND I THINK PART OF THAT DOUBT IS THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION HOW THE TWO PARTIES WILL COME TO AGREEMENT AND IF THE PROCESS IS NOT CALLED WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS INTO YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S A- I'M- IS AND THE PLANTS. IN THREE WITH PROCESS MIGHT BE IN TERMS OF THESE OF THESE REAL. BUT THEN ULTIMATELY THE DEPARTMENT WOULD HOLD. ACCOUNTABLE IF AN AMMO REVIEW WAS NOT AGREE TO OKAY IS THE- CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT THE TEACHERS WOULD BE THE ULTIMATE. ACCOUNTABILITY BUT AT SOME POINT YOU KNOW THERE'S SO THAT EVERYTHING DOESN'T HAVE TO ALWAYS FLOATED THE DH CS. RESITA THERE SINCE. YOU KNOW MY ON A STANDARDIZED MAY NOT BOAST SOME AND WHATEVER OTHER HEALTH PLANS ARE IN THE REGION. THERE ARE SIMILAR PROCESS SEES FOR YOU KNOW EITHER DISPUTE RESOLUTION OR OTHER THINGS THAT MAY HOPEFULLY NOT LEAD TO FINALLY- YOU KNOW ANYBODY CAN HAVING. THE END AGAIN THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE TO TRY TO TRYING TO BE SURE MAKE THINGS FOR PEOPLE TO VALLEY FORGE WE GO EMMA YOU THEN- BE SURE THERE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR EMMA YOU- AND THEN- AND THEN THE OTHER. I HAVE IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHEN ONE COMPOUNDED THIS AGREEMENT IS. PROVIDING SPECIALTY ACCESS FOR FQHCS. THROUGH KAISER IN MAYBE THE QUESTION MORE DIRECTLY FROM KAISER. NOW OF COURSE KAISER'S MODEL IS THIS IS ACTUALLY CLOSE SYSTEM THAT'S MORE EFFECTIVE EFFICIENT YOU HAVE COMMUNICATIONS AND SO FORTH. HOW HOW WOULD THAT WORK IF YOUR PRIMARY CARE SITE IS AND IF YOU SEE THAT'S NOT PART OF THE KAISER SYSTEM- SO I'D BE CURIOUS THE- MINIMUM. FROM KAISER LIKE HOW ARE YOU GOING TO. WHAT IS GOING TO BE THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT THE FAQS AND KAISER FOR THE SPECIALTY ACCESS. AND SO HOW'S THAT GOING TO WORK AND WHAT KIND OF TREATMENTS ARE NECESSARY AND THEN I ALSO WANT TO HEAR FROM THE PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION ABOUT THAT. SO THAT YOU KNOW IT IS SO THAT SAMPLES IS GOING TO BE I WENT TO UNIVERSITY LEVEL DAHLE IF USING THEIR OU OPERATE AND HOW DO YOU DECIDE HOW MANY SPECIALTY REFERRALS AND STUFF YOU'RE GOING TO GET. SURE I THINK THE QUESTION. IS WHAT. I THINK WITH THE- TO THAT THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS HERE. I COMMITMENTS OCCURRED SESSIONS ACCESS MEDICAL SOMETHING WE'RE WE'RE WITH THAT ON. AS SOON AS A VALUE TO YOUR TO ABLE TO RESOURCES TO THE COMMUNITY- ESPECIALLY WHERE THERE'S PROVIDER SHORTAGES RIGHTS I THINK THAT THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF ONE ONE CHILLER OF THAT AND THAT COMMITMENT IS TO SPECIALTY ACCESS FOR KAISER INFERRED ON HYGIENE. ONE THING I LOOK. THE OTHER THING TO POINT OUT IS I'M GONNA THIS WAS THIS WAS TIME ABOUT REALLY- THAT WOULD REGARDS TO PRIMARY- OUR MEMBERS ARE QUESTIONS. AS YOU MENTION WILL ALWAYS HAVE ACCESS TO BECAUSE MANY DAY. PCPS WHO. TRIED TO ATTACK THAT DOES NOT CHANGE. AT ALL YES I THINK- THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THAT FEW WEEKS HE'S REALLY- YOU KNOW WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE COMMUNITIES FOR EXAMPLE- YOU KNOW- BEST PRACTICES AROUND POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT- ACCESS TO SPECIALTY HEALTH CENTER. SO I THINK I THINK THAT'S KIND OF ONE FORTY NINE IS THAT- YOU KNOW THE KAISER PERMANENTE A MODEL INMATE DELIVERY SYSTEM THE RIGHT TO ACCESS OKAY. YES CHANGE YEAH I KNOW NINE OTHER DOESN'T SEEM SO THAT'S THAT'S A CHALLENGE FOR IT SO I SEE THE PROPOSAL THEY'RE SAYING THAT. KAISER WILL OFFER SUBSPECIALTY ACCESS TO FAQS WHO ARE TAKING CARE OF NON KAISER PATIENTS BECAUSE YOU SAID IF THERE ARE TIES ARE PATIENT AND MEDICARE. BE GOING TO YOUR PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS. AND AS AND CERTAIN PLACE. SUDDENLY YEARS. METALLIC STEEL PITOT EVER. AND I GETTING THESE REFERRAL FROM THESE BECAUSE DOCTOR AT F. Q. RIGHT AND THE YEAH. AND ABOUT WAY THEY DON'T. YEAH THEY MEDIA DIFFERENT EHR STAY. I AND SO THE BECAUSE IS HOW. ARE YOU REALLY TO BE TO THESE F. AND THEIR- FOR REFERRAL ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU KNOW ARE YOU ARE REQUIRED THEY HAVE TO BE ON THE SAME EHR SYSTEM. ARE YOU GOING TO PUT. A WHAT KIND OF BARRIERS MIGHT BE PUT UP THERE ARE YOU KNOW HOW OPEN ARE YOU GOING TO BE- TO THESE EFFORTS TO THE F. CUES IN THEIR PROVIDERS TO THE SUB SPECIALTY REFERRALS- ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU USED TO OPERATING AS A CLOSE SYSTEMS AND ALL YOUR- SPECIALTY. FOLKS IN OAKLAND FROM THE CLERKS THE DOCTORS THE NURSES HAVE TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE WHO AREN'T PART OF THE KAISER SYSTEM. HERE NOW ARE SHOWING UP AND SAY HEY I'M A MEDICAL PATIENT INEED THE L. E. N. T. SIR- BUT YOU DON'T USE. EHR YOU DON'T WHATEVER. SO HOW WE SUPPOSED TO. WORK WITH YOU ON THAT. SURE I'M QUITE A SENIOR THAT DRUG BOSS ON POPPED UP MOSTLY WANT TO TRY IN BUT I ONE THING I CAN IS THAT IF AT WITH TO SPECIALTY ACCESS I SEE THAT REALLY IT'S DOWN A CALL YOU ACT NOT NECESSARILY SOME NOTES TIED TO THE CASUAL COMMITTEE SYSTEM. US I THINK THAT'S ONE THING I LIKE TO THINK EVERYTHING OUT SHARED- IS THAT- TYPE OF- SAYS IN TERMS OF HOW THAT WORKS NO WE IS KAISER WE WILL WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH. DTS ALSO WITH THE ASSOCIATION I TO MAKE SURE THAT OKAY THAT WORKS WORK FOR THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WILL SERVE SETS IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO WORK THROUGH BUT IT WILL BE DONE COLLABORATIVELY WITH PEACE OKAY. ALSO THE CLINICS ALL RIGHT WELL I APPRECIATE IT WILL BE A VALUE ADD IF IT ACTUALLY HAPPENS SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA RY TO MAKE IT HAPPEN I AFTER THAT I HAVE I. AM THEY HAVE SINCE. I WAS A SKEPTICISM RIGHT WHERE BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT. ISSUES TO MAKE IT. BECAUSE KIND. SYSTEM IS ABOUT THE- TO BE A- AND NOW WE'RE OPENING A- WERE UP. PART OF SYSTEM. AND SO IT'S GONNA REQUIRED NOT ONLY OF COURSE SOMEONE NIELSEN ADMINISTRATORS GONNA REQUIRE EVERYBODY FROM YOU KNOW THAT THE- FIRST TO THEIR TO THEIR SUPPORT STAFF AND I WANT TO SAY WE ARE GOING TO DO THIS. OTHERWISE IT'S SO EASY FOR THEM TO CLOSE A VALLEY QUE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DIDN'T SEND THE FORM THE RIGHT WAY WERE USED TO EATING USE OUR SYSTEM IT'S ADDRESS. AND NOTHING AND THEN BASICALLY PEOPLE ACTUALLY GET ACCESS- IF YOU DON'T MIND- IF THE- LET ME LET'S GO TO THE- PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION AND- YOU WANT. TO ADD ON TO THAT- IF YOU DON'T MIND. SO ARE YOU SEE THIS WORKING. YES THANK YOU SENATOR PAN- I AM GOING TO JUST DID- WHAT YOU SAID IT'S REALLY COMPLICATED- AND WE KNOW THIS WE'VE BEEN ASKING FOR KAISER OPEN UP SPECIALTY FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS AND- IT'S A BIG MOVES THAT THE PERMANENT TAKE GROUP AND I WANT TO JUST THANK THEM FOR BEING WILLING TO DO THIS AT ALL THINKING ABOUT THIS WITH US. WE STARTED EXPLORING WHAT THIS WOULD LOOK LIKE LAST ABOUT LAST SUMMER I GUESS WE REALLY STARTED DIVING INTO IT LAST FALL I'M AT IN OUR POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT WORK AND I JUST WANT TO UNDERSCORE IT IS REALLY COMPLICATED THERE'S BEEN A SPECIALTY GROUP OF KAISER PERMANENTE DOCTORS AND FACILITATORS AND- REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE HEALTH CENTER SYSTEM TO REALLY DIVING INTO DATA BECAUSE WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO. WHERE THE- NEED. ARE BY ZIP CODE BY SPECIALTY BY ACUITY AND WHAT'S THE BEST WAY BECAUSE THERE ISN'T WE JUST DO NOT HAVE. THE PHYSICAL HUMAN OUR TO. FILL ALL THE SPECIALTIES SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT SO THEY'VE JUST WANT TO COMMEND THERE'S BEEN A GROUP OF PEOPLE REALLY FOCUSED ON THIS AND HAVE I MENTIONED THIS TO MY TESTIMONY WE DON'T HAVE. WE HAVEN'T SPENT ENOUGH TIME TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT AND I DO BE UNIQUE BY COUNTY BY PLAN BOB AND ONE OF THE- THINGS WE ENCOUNTERED WAS IN ONE OF THE PLANTS IN THE AREAS THAT ONE OF THE COUNTIES WHERE WE'RE WHERE WE REALIZED THAT THERE WAS A HUGE SPECIALTY NEED AND WE STARTED TO DIVE IN. IT WAS A PLAN THERE THAT THEY HAD ALREADY STARTED WORK ON SO WE SO PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS KAISER IS NOT THERE TO NECESSARY THEY'RE NOT THERE TO DISRUPT THE SYSTEM THAT THEY'RE TO BE A VALUE ADD SO PART OF THE LEVEL OF COMPLICATION AS WELL AS PLANS ARE ALSO THINKING ABOUT THIS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TWO. AND SO WE'VE GOT TO DO THIS BY COUNTY IN SOME CASES AND BY SPECIALTY INSECURITY AND NEEDED SUPPOSED SO IT JUST HAS MULTIPLE LAYERS OF COMPLEXITY BUT WE'RE HAPPY THAT WE ARE DIVING IN AND I WOULD NOT SLOW THAT DOWN AT ALL AND JUST CREATING SOMETHING IN THE PROCESS IN THE LANGUAGE AND I APPRECIATE ALL THE PIECES OF WHERE'S THE LANGUAGE. PATIENT TRAILER BUT WE JUST NEED SOMETHING TO KEEP IT GOING AND THE PRESSURE ON HERE BECAUSE THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR SO LONG WE NEED TO KEEP KAISER AT THE TABLE WITH US THINKING ABOUT THIS AND FINDING A WAY TO BRIDGE THE GAPS AND SPECIALTY CHEN OKAY AND DRUG BUST YOU ONE SAY SOMETHING TO THIS NO I WAS JUST GOING TO. BE COVERED A LOT OF WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF FOR A LOT OF DATA TO IDENTIFY WHERE SOME OF THESE AREAS AND WATER AT SOME OF THE PARTNERSHIPS THAT MIGHT OCCUR- AND JUST TO BE FULLY TRANSPARENT BEING GIVEN KIND OF SOME OF THE OPPOSITION ON THIS ENTIRE PROPOSAL IS PUT A LITTLE BIT OF A PAUSE ON THAT WORK I'M JUST REALLY NOT INTENDING TO RUFFLE FEATHERS ANY WORK I'M BUT I THINK WE VALUE THAT WE KNOW WE NEED MORE. ESPECIALLY CARE ACCESS WE KNOW WE NEED TO ENGAGE AS MANY ARE PROVIDERS AT IT AT THAT CITIZENS ARE GOING TO HELP TEACHERS. FROM PERSPECTIVE WE- EXCITING ARE TO OF MATCH DIFFERENT- DIFFERENT ENTITIES THAT MAYBE HAVE A PARTNER TO THIS WAY AND REALLY INTO BEING TRYING TO THROUGH HOW WE CAN MORE SO. OKAY THANK YOU- JUST MAKING AND A BEFORE FINISH AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO SENATE AGREE. THAT AFTER YEAH I'M I'M A PRIMARY CARE TO DOCTOR TO ACTUALLY THAT AS IT KAISER SO- I AM BE. MAY NOT BE THE LET'S NEXT YEAR MAYBE COMING BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES AND SAYING HEY THIS IS MY EXPERIENCE AND IT DIDN'T WORK OR DID WORK OR SOMETHING SO- I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO. SPECIAL ACT. THE ACCESS BUT- SOMETIMES- IS IT PEOPLE ARE NECESSARILY COME CHANGING WAITED THINGS AND THIS IS GONNA REQUIRE SPECIALIST AT KAISER TO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY IF THEY'RE ACTUALLY GONNA OPEN UP TO- NINE KAISER PATIENTS ARE COMING FROM F. KEYS SO I CERTAINLY WISH YOU I HOPE THIS IS ACCEPTABLE- AND I WANTED TO BE SUCCESSFUL BUT THAT I'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT FOR GRANTED IT'S GOING. TO HAPPEN WITHOUT A LOT OF EFFORT ON BOTH SIDES SO I APPRECIATE THAT OKAY THAT- AND IT'S THAT NOW- ACT SENATOR IS HERE BEEN TO IN ANOTHER COMMITTEE- HAS SOME QUESTIONS IS THAT THE AND- AGAIN YOU MISTER CHAIR POLICY ARM IN A FIVE. THIRTY BEEN ASKED WE FORGE PLEASE THAT'S OUR BEEN ASK AND I CAN STAFF WE WILL WHY THAT HE AND GIVE ME THE RECEIPT. SO I DO A HAVE BEEN BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN TWO- AND THEN I HAVE THIS ONE- SO I NEED SOMEBODY TO ME UNDER WHY GOVERNOR'S OR THE FOR THIS IT APPEARS TO ME THAT COULD SIGNAL STE. PROVIDERS IN OUR SAY NET- TO OPEN THIS AND THEN ALL- I'D LIKE TO KNOW. AS YOU KNOW WITH A TWO YEAR PANDEMIC JUST THREE. BY US ARE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM ARE ARE A STE- EXTRA. DOES THIS HAVE TO BE DONE. AND- WHAT ARE THE REPERCUSSIONS IF THE LEGISLATURE REJECTS THIS PROPOSAL. THAT SOUNDS LIKE A DIRECTOR PROCESS AND I THINK. I THANK YOU I'LL I'LL TRY TO SUMMARIZE MANY OF THESE POINTS HAVE BEEN COVERED BUT REALLY FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THIS ADDS ADDITIONAL CAPACITY IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAMS QUALITY PROVIDERS FOR SHERRY STOKES I THINK IT. CONFLICT WITH THE SAFETY NET IT DOESN'T ON IT MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES AND THE REASON WE'RE PROPOSING THIS IS THAT WE GO LIVE WITH OUR NEW MEDICAID MANAGED CARE CONTRACTS JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND SO WE THAT WE WANT TO ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS AND UNDERSTAND WHO ARE ARE PLANNED PARTNERS ARE SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE READINESS TO IN A MONTH PROCESS THAT WILL BEGIN THIS SUMMER ONCE WE HAVE A OUR PLAN IDENTIFY. M. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT. I GUESS MY- IT SEEMS LIKE TO ME THE WAY I UNDERSTAND THIS COULD GO IS IT A KAISER COULD ACTUALLY AND JUST REFER OUT ALL I MEAN MEDICARE'S WHAT FIFTEEN CENTS ON THE DOLLAR FOURTEEN CENTS ON THE DOLLAR SOME UNGODLY REIMBURSEMENT NUMBER- AND SO IF THAT HAPPENS AND YOU JUST REFER OUT THAT MEDICARE PATIENTS TO. OUR SAFETY NET PROVIDERS WELL THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE AND THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. AS WELL THAT YOU KNOW WILL THAT IMPEDE THEM FROM DOING THAT BECAUSE THE AFFORDABILITY ISSUE FROM THE HOSPITAL PERSPECTIVE. UNDER THIS PROPOSAL ALL OF THE NEW CARS ARE MEMBERS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE. CARED FOR THE PRIMARY CARE SERVICES WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE CARED FOR IN IN THE KAISER FACILITIES SO THAT I REFERRAL OUT TO. TO THE SAFETY NET IS NOT IS NOT PART OF WHAT THIS THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BE ABOUT. OKAY AND THEN I GUESS MY LAST QUESTION I THINK IT'S LIKE THE SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLAR QUESTION. WHAT HAPPENS IF THE CONTRACT DOESN'T GET APPROVED- I KIND OF WANTED A MORE DIRECT ANSWER WILL KAISER PERMANENTE A ACCENT THE MEDIC CAL AND- MANAGED CARE SYSTEM. AGAIN I THINK I WOULD PROBABLY REFER ARE DEBT THAT'S A CRAZY QUESTION I THINK IT'S A KAISER QUESTION I GUESS IS THAT THE FEAR FROM THE ADMINISTRATION IS A KAISER WOULD EXIT THIS AND MEDIC CAL MANAGED CARE SYSTEM WELL GRABBED HER FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE JUST. THIS IS ACTUALLY GETTING KAISER TO PARTICIPATE MORE THAN THEY DO TODAY SO EVEN IF WE WERE JUST TO STIPULATE THAT WE SAY THE STATUS QUO WITHOUT THIS WE ARE GETTING MORE FROM KAISER WITH THIS PROPOSAL THAN WE DO TODAY IMPACTS THE VALUE ADD TO OUR MEDICAL PROGRAM AND BENEFIT YOUR REASON WHY WE'RE DOING THIS BUT ALL THE ALCOHOL AT UNIT OVER TO KAISER ON JAN THREE. THANK YOU MA'AM. SURE YEAH I WOULD WOULD THAT GO. DIRECTOR BY. MENTIONED IS A THIS IS REALLY OPPORTUNE FOR. TO TAKE THAT THE CALL- IT HAS IN. IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM STATE ARE REALLY I THINK YOU KNOW MY BACK TO THE AYE AYE AYE ANDERSON. YOUR I'M YOU CAME IN- A LITTLE THING THAT I'M IN EARLIER IS THAT FOR KAISER I RESPECT. THIS IS ABOUT. I'M ADDING. FOR THE MEDIC PROGRAM AND THEM TO COME. ARE I THAT IS THE IS REALLY I THINK WHAT. WE ARM OUR WAY WITH THE- ON TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT- FOR OF OUR OUR MEMBER AND ALSO FOR THE- THAT WOULD. THAT WOULD. BE THE NEXT- FIVE YEARS OF THE QUESTION CONTRACT WITH THAT 20% GROWTH THAT'S PART OF COMMITMENT I'M SO I THINK THAT REALLY WOULD BE THE- I GUESS THAT. YOU KNOW I SEE THE DOWNSIDE RISK I THINK YOU KNOW IN THE END AT THE END OF THE DAY I THINK OUR FACILITIES. ARE DOCTORS OR PROVIDERS ARE GOING TO CARE FOR OUR MEMBERS BUT I THINK IN TERMS OF THE PROPOSAL- I THINK OUR DEPOSIT BASS IT REALLY DOES EXPAND. I'M ACCESS TO. PERMANENT THESE QUALITY HEALTHCARE FOR OUR INDIVIDUALS. ACROSS THE STATE. RECEIVE THAT ELOQUENT RESPONSE. THAT LINK CLEAREST. BUT I STILL LIKE MY QUESTION A- IS K. PERMAN. A HAVE ANY. M. DESIRE IN CLEAN OR HAVE YOU TALKED ABOUT EXITING THE MEDIC. SYSTEM MANAGED CARE SYSTEM IF THIS. PROPOSAL IS NOT- SECURED. AGAIN WHAT I WHAT I MENTIONED EARLIER AT ALL RESTATE THIS- STATES A KAISER PERMANENTE'S INTEREST IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM IS PART OF ITS CORE MISSION. I THINK WE ARE. SHARED EARLIER THAT- BECAUSE PERMANENT DATE- LOSES ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR I'M A MEDIC CAL THAT'S AND KERN ST- AND DATA WITH THIS PROPOSAL ACTUALLY GOING TO INCREASE- ARE OUR MEDICARE FOR TRAINING YOU NEED MORE COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE SO FOR KAISER I THINK. I'M SERVING THE MEDICAID POPULATION I'M SERVING THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE- IS PART OF OUR MISSION IT'S PART OF OUR DNA I'M SORRY I CAN'T IMAGINE A SCENARIO WHICH KILEY DOZENS. MEMBERS. PRECIADO AN M. BUT I'M A BUSINESS OWNER TO AND IF YOU'RE LOSING TO DOLLARS A ON MEDICARE REMEMBER THEN THERE'S A HE ISSUE THERE- I DON'T THAT SHE THAT LOS- WITH SAFETY NET PROVIDERS IN OTHER AREAS- IS GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM AND- AGAIN I KNOW YOU SAID YOUR MISSION IS TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS BUT YOU STILL HAVEN'T ANSWERED MY QUESTION HAVE THERE BEEN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT KAISER.
