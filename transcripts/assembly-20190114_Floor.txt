THANK YOU AND MISTER SPEAKER AN MEMBERS I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF A AS YOU'RE IN MEMORY OF MISTER ARBOR STONE -- ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS WE HAVE WE MEMORIALIZE MISTER STONE BECAUSE OF HIS TREMENDOUS CONTRIBUTION TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA -- YOU READ HIS RESUME AND YOU READ A LOT ABOUT HIS MILITARY SERVICE IN A SERVICE TO COMMUNITY. BUT HE WAS A SELFLESS AND TIRELESS OF FIGHTER FOR EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AND JUSTICE IN CALIFORNIA. WELL AS SOON AS I BECAME A MEMBER OF THIS HOUSE OF THE FIRST PERSON ONE OF FIRST PERSONS I'VE MET WAS OBVIOUS STONE. I HAD NO IDEA WHO HE WAS BUT HE MADE SURE THAT EVERY MEMBER OF THE BLACK CAUCUS KNEW WHO HE WAS. AND UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF HIS MISSION WHICH WAS TO BASICALLY PROMOTE BLACK BUSINESSES AND BLACK ENTERPRISE IN THE ENGAGEMENT OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY. AND SO I WAS HONORED TO KNOW HIM AND TO SEE A PERSON WHO REALLY WAS VERY PASSIONATE. AND CONCERN IN A VERY SELFLESS WAY AUBREY STONE NEVER PROMOTING SOME BUSINESS THAT HE OWNS BUT REALLY PROMOTING THE INCLUSION OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THE BUSINESS LIFE OF CALIFORNIA. AND HE DID IT EVERYWHERE IN CALIFORNIA HE DID IT DID NOT ONLY IN SACRAMENTO BUT IN SANDY A GO HE DID IT THE WAY PACKED HE DID IT TO VARIOUS KINDS OF THINGS. AND SUPPORT OF VARIOUS PIECES OF LEGISLATION HE WAS ALWAYS THERE IS A VOICE HIS CONFERENCES OF THROUGHOUT THE STATE WILL WELL ATTENDED. AND SO HE KEPT THE CONCEPT OF BLACK BUSINESSES ON THE MINDS OF LEGISLATORS. EVERYWHERE IN CALIFORNIA AND WE WERE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT. IT'S QUICK TO YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE CALIFORNIA'S BLACK BUSINESS VOICE WITHOUT ARBOR STONE. BECAUSE THERE WERE VERY FEW PEOPLE WHO CARRY THAT MESSAGE. CONSISTENTLY AS HE DID WITHOUT AN INTEREST IN HIS OWN PERSONAL PROMOTION BUT REALLY IN A PROMOTION OF BLACK BUSINESSES ITSELF. HE WAS A LEADER IN OUR CHAMBER MOVEMENT HE ESTABLISHED THE BLACK CHAMBER BUT HE WAS A LEADER IN THAT WITH ALL OF THE OTHER ENTITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE NEVER TRYING TO TAKE OVER ANY PARTICULAR. INDIVIDUAL CHAMBER WHERE THERE WAS A SAN DIEGO BLACK CHAMBER OR SOMEONE ELSE BUT REALLY TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE CHAMBERS HAVE THE SUPPORT. OF A STATEWIDE NETWORK THAT WOULD HELP THEM TO GROW AND TO DEVELOP. AND SO WE'VE MISSED ARBOR STONE AND HE WAS SO IMPORTANCE INTERESTING OF HIS CONTACT. AND HIS PRESENCE IN THE SACRAMENTO COMMUNITY IN THE STATE COMMUNITY WAS SO IMPORTANT HIM AND ALL OF THE OTHER LEGISLATIVE INDIVIDUALS KNEW HIM AND ALL THE AGENCIES KNEW HIM. IT WAS KIND OF HILARIOUS IN THE END BECAUSE THEY'VE WE PUT OUT THE LYING IN STE A DAY HERE IN THE CASH BECAUSE HE WAS FULL IN JUST THAT. OF IMPORTANT IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY OF COURSE WE HAD TO LEARN VERY QUICKLY THEY DID LEARN VERY QUICKLY THAT WE DON'T HAVE BODIES LINE STATE WE'VE ONLY HAD TWO OR THREE IN THE HISTORY OF THE CAPITAL AND SO FORTH AND SO ON AND YOU HAVE TO BE A FORMER. ELECTED OFFICIAL WHATEVER WHATEVER BUT THEY JUST TO ME IT WAS KIND OF A LAYER IS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT. BUT IT WAS ALSO AN EMPTY IN A STATEMENT TO ME THAT THIS MAN WAS THAT IMPORTANT TO THE SACRAMENTO COMMUNITY. THAT WHEN HE DIED THEY WANTED THE WHOLE WORLD TO RECOGNIZE HIM TO SAY LOOK HE SAW IMPORTANT HE IS IN THE STATE CAPITAL LYING IN STATE AND SO WE HAD TO MAKE SURE WE GET THE MESSAGE OUT SO THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE. THRONGS OF PEOPLE COMING TO THE CAPITAL LOOKING FARBER STONE BUT IT REALLY IS IT IN MY MIND WAS A STRONG TESTAMENT OF JUST HOW POWERFUL HE WAS IN TERMS OF HIS QUIET PRESENCE IN THE IN THE FIELD OF BUSINESS. AND BUSINESS ENTERPRISE WE THANK HIS FAMILY FOR SHARING THEM WITH US BECAUSE HE GAVE A LOT OF HIS LIFE LOT OF HIS TIME AND A LOT OF HIS RESOURCES. AND PROMOTING BLACK BUSINESSES AND SO I REQUEST THAT WE JOIN IN MEMORY OF A STOPPER STONE. THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER MISTER GIBSON. DIRECTX.
