THROUGH A THREE YEAR LAWSUIT

00:56:43.032 --> 00:56:45.535
INTERESTING TOOL TO CITIES THAT

00:56:45.602 --> 00:56:47.070
ARE CURRENTLY REALLY STRUGGLING

00:56:47.137 --> 00:56:49.672
WITH- WITH ALL THE POLITICS

00:56:49.739 --> 00:56:52.342
ASSOCIATED WITH SEA LEVEL RISE

AMENDMENTS SUGGESTED THE

00:57:00.316 --> 00:57:00.717
ANALYSIS THE ODD MORE

00:57:00.784 --> 00:57:02.786
SPECIFICITY. TO HELP US AROUND

00:57:02.852 --> 00:57:03.553

TELLING MY STAFF ACTUALLY I'VE

00:57:06.923 --> 00:57:08.992
READ OVER THE MEN'S OF THESE

00:57:09.058 --> 00:57:09.526
ARE REALLY GOOD AMENDMENTS

00:57:09.592 --> 00:57:11.161
BECAUSE THEY- THEY- PAY FORCE.

00:57:11.227 --> 00:57:12.729
ANALYSIS YOU KNOW WE ALREADY

00:57:12.796 --> 00:57:13.997
HAVE A LIMIT OF IT BUT IT

00:57:14.063 --> 00:57:16.032
REALLY FOCUSES IN ON. THE

00:57:16.099 --> 00:57:19.269
IMPORTANCE OF OUR- INSURING

00:57:19.335 --> 00:57:20.170
THAT THIS DOESN'T LOSE ANY

00:57:20.236 --> 00:57:22.405
MONEY. FOR THE STATE OR FOR THE

00:57:22.472 --> 00:57:23.006
PUBLIC PURSE THE COST

00:57:23.072 --> 00:57:24.507
EFFECTIVENESS. THE PUBLIC

00:57:24.574 --> 00:57:26.176
BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH BUYING

00:57:26.242 --> 00:57:28.444
A PROPERTY AND ALSO. THE EXTENT

00:57:28.511 --> 00:57:32.549
TO WHICH- IT'S PART OF A- OF A

00:57:32.615 --> 00:57:35.084
OF A OF A LOCAL REGIONAL PLAN

00:57:35.151 --> 00:57:38.788
THAT'S COHERENT AND- IS- COME

00:57:38.855 --> 00:57:41.024
MORE COHERENTLY ADDRESSING THE

00:57:41.090 --> 00:57:42.325
IMPACTS OF SEA LEVEL RISE SO

00:57:42.392 --> 00:57:44.828
WE'RE SEEING SEA LEVEL RISE AS

00:57:44.894 --> 00:57:45.595
AN ISSUE. I'VE BEEN DOWN THE

00:57:45.662 --> 00:57:47.697
STATE OUR LA TIMES THAT A

00:57:47.764 --> 00:57:50.200
FASCINATING- SPECIAL SECTION ON

00:57:50.266 --> 00:57:53.303
THIS ISSUE- THE L. A. O.

00:57:53.369 --> 00:57:55.104
ESTIMATES AROUND EIGHT TO TEN

00:57:55.171 --> 00:57:56.206
BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF

00:57:56.272 --> 00:57:57.740
EXISTING PROPERTIES LIKELY TO

00:57:57.807 --> 00:57:59.676
BE UNDER WATER BY TWENTY FIFTY.

00:57:59.742 --> 00:58:01.244
WHICH IS WILD TO THINK ABOUT

00:58:01.311 --> 00:58:02.779
MORE THAN A HUNDRED FIFTY

00:58:02.846 --> 00:58:04.080
BILLION DOLLARS IN PROPERTY

00:58:04.147 --> 00:58:06.349
COULD BE AT RISK OF FLOODING.

00:58:06.416 --> 00:58:09.586
BY- TWENTY BY. YEAH TWENTY ONE

00:58:09.652 --> 00:58:10.820
HUNDRED IS THAT THE AND HOW WAS

00:58:10.887 --> 00:58:13.523
IT- THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE

00:58:13.590 --> 00:58:14.123
LOOKING FOR WAYS TO ADDRESS

00:58:14.190 --> 00:58:15.992
THIS CRISIS- BOUNCING VERY

00:58:16.059 --> 00:58:16.893
LIMITED BUDGETS WITH FEW GOOD

00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:18.862
OPTIONS WITH THE NEEDS OF

00:58:18.928 --> 00:58:20.530
HOMEOWNERS. SO WHAT YOU'RE

00:58:20.597 --> 00:58:21.698
SEEING IS THE YOU HAVE AREAS

00:58:21.764 --> 00:58:23.366
THAT ARE ALREADY EXPERIENCING

00:58:23.433 --> 00:58:23.867
FLOODING THAT THE C. IS

00:58:23.933 --> 00:58:29.839
STARTING TO- TO RISE. AND- THE

00:58:29.906 --> 00:58:30.974
MORE FIND A COURSE THAT BUYING

00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:32.675
OUT LOCAL RESIDENTS RELOCATING

00:58:32.742 --> 00:58:33.343
THEM IT'S BEEN VERY

00:58:33.409 --> 00:58:34.744
CONTROVERSIAL IN SOME INSTANCES

00:58:34.811 --> 00:58:37.647
COST PROHIBITIVE- SO THERE'S A

00:58:37.714 --> 00:58:38.882
LOT OF POLITICS IN THESE TOWNS

00:58:38.948 --> 00:58:40.083
THOUGH RIGHT THE LOCAL

00:58:40.149 --> 00:58:41.017
HOMEOWNERS COME TO THE CITY

00:58:41.084 --> 00:58:43.019
COUNCIL THEY SAY YOU GET USED

00:58:43.086 --> 00:58:44.120
TO SPEND EVERY WAKING HOUR

00:58:44.187 --> 00:58:45.288
DOING EVERYTHING YOU POSSIBLY

00:58:45.355 --> 00:58:46.890
CAN SPENDING EVERY LAST DIME OF

00:58:46.956 --> 00:58:48.458
THE CITY BUDGET TO PROTECT MY

00:58:48.524 --> 00:58:50.260
HOME AND YOU CAN SEE WHY PEOPLE

00:58:50.326 --> 00:58:51.361
DO THAT THIS IS THEIR HOME IF

00:58:51.427 --> 00:58:51.828
SOMETHING THAT NEED IS

00:58:51.895 --> 00:58:53.329
INCREDIBLY MEANINGFUL TO THEM.

00:58:53.396 --> 00:58:54.397
AND CITIES ARE NOW FACED WITH

00:58:54.464 --> 00:58:56.099
THESE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT

00:58:56.165 --> 00:58:56.633
CHOICES WHETHER HAVING TO

00:58:56.699 --> 00:58:58.101
CHOOSE BETWEEN BUIDING PUTTING

00:58:58.167 --> 00:58:59.535
MORE MONEY INTO A SEA WALL

00:58:59.602 --> 00:59:01.938
WHICH KEEPS COLLAPSING- TO

00:59:02.005 --> 00:59:03.473
PROTECT IT A STRETCH OF BEACH

00:59:03.539 --> 00:59:05.975
OF THE INSPECTOR HOME'S OR YOU

00:59:06.042 --> 00:59:07.410
SEE THAT MONEY GO TO THE FIRE

00:59:07.477 --> 00:59:08.745
DEPARTMENT OR TO YOU KNOW THE

00:59:08.811 --> 00:59:12.882
PARKS OR OR OR OTHER IMPORTANT

00:59:12.949 --> 00:59:14.951
LOCAL SERVICES. SO THIS IS THE

00:59:15.018 --> 00:59:16.486
THIS IS THE IN FACT THE TIMES

00:59:16.552 --> 00:59:17.987
HAD A LITTLE CHART WHERE YOU

00:59:18.054 --> 00:59:19.322
COULD FOLLOW THE DIFFICULT

00:59:19.389 --> 00:59:20.323
DECISION MAKING OF A CITY

00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:22.058
COUNCIL MEMBER TRYING TO

00:59:22.125 --> 00:59:24.794
BALANCE THE INTENSE LOCAL

00:59:24.861 --> 00:59:26.396
POLITICAL NEEDS YOUR BUDGETARY

00:59:26.462 --> 00:59:29.399
NEEDS. IT'S SUCH A- SO WHAT

00:59:29.465 --> 00:59:32.835
WITH THE IDEA HERE- IS THAT AND

00:59:32.902 --> 00:59:34.337
IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT THE

00:59:34.404 --> 00:59:35.605
COST IN LIVES AND TREASURE THE

00:59:35.672 --> 00:59:36.406
COULD HAVE BEEN SAVED OF

00:59:36.472 --> 00:59:38.141
CALIFORNIA TAKING MORE ACTION

00:59:38.207 --> 00:59:40.643
DECADES AGO. AND TO BETTER

00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:42.445
MITIGATE AGAINST- THE THREAD OF

00:59:42.512 --> 00:59:45.281
DEVASTATING WILDFIRES. WHAT IF

00:59:45.348 --> 00:59:48.384
WE CREATE A FIND. A PERMISSIVE.

00:59:48.451 --> 00:59:50.053
THAT WOULD PROVIDE LOCAL

00:59:50.119 --> 00:59:50.653
GOVERNMENTS WITH THE FINANCING

00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:53.423
OPTION. TO ALLEVIATE THE RISKS

00:59:53.489 --> 00:59:54.490
OF SEA LEVEL RISE WHILE

00:59:54.557 --> 00:59:55.658
PROTECTING BOTH PROPERTY OWNERS

00:59:55.725 --> 00:59:57.160
AND TAXPAYERS SO THE IDEA IS

00:59:57.226 --> 00:59:59.095
IT'S A REVOLVING LOAN FUND. IT

00:59:59.162 --> 01:00:00.496
WITH BASICALLY WOULD GO FOR THE

01:00:00.563 --> 01:00:01.030
MONEY WOULD GO TO LOCAL

01:00:01.097 --> 01:00:03.633
GOVERNMENTS TO BUY PROPERTIES

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:05.435
THAT WILL BE THREATENED IN IN A

01:00:05.501 --> 01:00:07.637
DECADE OR TWO. ARE THEY CAN

01:00:07.704 --> 01:00:09.305
ALLOW THE OWNERS TO SELL WHILE

01:00:09.372 --> 01:00:11.240
THE HOUSE STILL HAS VALUE. AND

01:00:11.307 --> 01:00:12.675
OF COURSE THESE ARE VERY OFTEN

01:00:12.742 --> 01:00:13.576
IS VERY ATTRACTIVE PROPERTIES

01:00:13.643 --> 01:00:15.545
RIGHT ON THE WATER. AND THEN

01:00:15.611 --> 01:00:16.279
THE GOT THE GOVERNMENT ENTITY

01:00:16.346 --> 01:00:19.949
CAN RENT OUT THE PROPERTYREPAYING THE LOAN. IN SOME

01:00:20.016 --> 01:00:21.150
CASES POTENTIALLY EVEN EARNING

WHEN PEOPLE SAY THAT BUT BUT IT

01:12:57.539 --> 01:12:59.041
IS IT IS SO THE IDEA IS THAT

01:12:59.108 --> 01:13:00.476
WHEN THE CURRENT LAW PROHIBITS

PUT THE RECYCLING SYMBOL ON

THEIR ITEMS ARE BECAUSE THERE'S

01:13:23.332 --> 01:13:26.268
NO PROHIBITION. AGAINST THAT SO

01:13:26.335 --> 01:13:27.369
THIS BILL EXTENDS THIS

01:13:27.436 --> 01:13:28.470

01:21:00.388 --> 01:21:01.957
CREATES CONFUSION AND LYFT

01:21:02.023 --> 01:21:03.858
WHICH CYCLING RESULTING IN

THAT RECYCLING IS NOT CONFUSING.

01:21:19.808 --> 01:21:20.342
CONSUMERS WANT TO DO THE RIGHT

01:21:20.408 --> 01:21:21.710

VERIFICATION ELIGIBLE AND ARE

01:21:25.847 --> 01:21:27.616
NOT RECYCLABLE AND THEY GET MAD

01:21:27.682 --> 01:21:28.817

01:21:30.619 --> 01:21:33.288
DECEPTIVE LABELING. I THINK

01:21:33.355 --> 01:21:33.855
THREE FOUR THREE WILL STOP

01:21:33.922 --> 01:21:35.757

THERE 90% OF STUFF IS NOT BE

01:36:22.409 --> 01:36:24.378
RECYCLED CAN'T BE RECYCLED AND-

01:36:24.445 --> 01:36:27.081
A CAT. IF WE HAVE WE WILL HAVE

01:36:27.148 --> 01:36:27.982
TO KNOWLEDGE SHE IT WOULD HAVE

01:36:28.048 --> 01:36:29.817
A MARKET OR DIFFICULTY DOES NOT

01:36:29.884 --> 01:36:31.185
FIT WITHIN OUR ENVIRONMENTAL

01:36:31.252 --> 01:36:33.687
CLEAN ENERGY OR LIKE CLIMATE

01:36:33.754 --> 01:36:34.955
CHANGE GOALS IT'S NOT

01:36:35.022 --> 01:36:36.157
TECHNOLOGY THAT WE COULD USE

01:36:36.223 --> 01:36:37.424
AND WE NEED TO BE TAKING ALL

01:36:37.491 --> 01:36:38.392
THAT INTO ACCOUNT AS WE'RE

01:36:38.459 --> 01:36:39.860
TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S RECYCLABLE

01:36:39.927 --> 01:36:40.694
AND HAVING A REAL CONVERSATION

01:36:40.761 --> 01:36:47.001
WITH. THE. COMMUNITY MEMBERS

01:36:47.067 --> 01:36:47.935
OUT THERE. THANK YOU. YES YOU.

VERY MUCH SENATOR FOR BRINGING

01:36:50.337 --> 01:36:53.174
THIS BILL FORWARD- I I'VE

01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:55.176
FASCINATED BY THE OPPOSITION

01:36:55.242 --> 01:36:57.278
ARGUMENT HERE A SOME OF THEM

01:36:57.344 --> 01:36:58.546
AND- I KNOW YOU'RE WRKING WITH

01:36:58.612 --> 01:37:01.282
THEM IN A CRISPY SHEET THAT-

YEAH I WAS I AM ALWAYS DILIGENT

01:37:04.151 --> 01:37:05.653
ABOUT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT OKAY.

01:37:05.719 --> 01:37:06.720
HOW HOW WHERE THINGS ARE

01:37:06.787 --> 01:37:08.822
SUPPOSED TO GO IN AND TRY TO DO

01:37:08.889 --> 01:37:10.157
THE RIGHT THING AND THE

01:37:10.224 --> 01:37:12.293
REALIZATION THAT THAT A LOT OF

01:37:12.359 --> 01:37:13.327
THESE PLASTICS ARE SIMPLY NOT

01:37:13.394 --> 01:37:15.062
RECYCLABLE. IS REALLY REALLY

01:37:15.129 --> 01:37:16.430
FRUSTRATING FOR PEOPLE TRYING

01:37:16.497 --> 01:37:18.165
TO DO THE RIGHT THING. I GUESS

01:37:18.232 --> 01:37:19.333
WHAT I FOUND INTERESTING ABOUT

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:21.035
THE OPPOSITION ARGUMENT WAS

01:37:21.101 --> 01:37:22.002
THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO LABEL

01:37:22.069 --> 01:37:22.670
SOMETHING DIFFERENT FOR

01:37:22.736 --> 01:37:25.206
CALIFORNIA. THEN OTHER STATES

01:37:25.272 --> 01:37:26.674
AND I WOULD JUST SAY WHY DON'T

01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:27.908
YOU JUST DO THE RIGHT THING AND

01:37:27.975 --> 01:37:29.043
LABEL IT LIKE WE DO IN

01:37:29.109 --> 01:37:31.078
CALIFORNIA AND STOP BEING

01:37:31.145 --> 01:37:32.980
DISINGENUOUS WITH OTHER STATES.

01:37:33.047 --> 01:37:34.415
GO TO ONE SYSTEM WE'RE GONNA

01:37:34.481 --> 01:37:35.416
WITH THIS IS GOING TO BE WELL

01:37:35.482 --> 01:37:36.717
VETTED WE KNOW WHAT CAN BE

01:37:36.784 --> 01:37:38.586
RECYCLED NOT WHEN WE JUST DO

01:37:38.652 --> 01:37:40.554
ONE SYSTEM. AND HAVE EVERYBODY

01:37:40.621 --> 01:37:42.056
ADOPTED THEN YOU WON'T HAVE TO

01:37:42.122 --> 01:37:43.857
FIGHT LEGISLATION IN EVERY

01:37:43.924 --> 01:37:45.893
STATE. JUST BITE THE BULLET AND

01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:47.461
DO IT RIGHT THANKS AND I WOULD

01:37:47.528 --> 01:37:49.597

COMMENTS- ANOTHER EXAMPLE FOR

01:37:59.073 --> 01:38:00.674
CALIFORNIA SHOULD LEAD THE REST

01:38:00.741 --> 01:38:02.443
OF THE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF.

01:38:02.509 --> 01:38:06.180
TRUTH AND RECYCLING- YOU KNOW

01:38:06.247 --> 01:38:08.482
THIS IDEA OF WISHFUL RECYCLING

01:38:08.549 --> 01:38:11.752
IS A CONSTANT- THE SUBJECT OF

01:38:11.819 --> 01:38:12.620
DEBATE BETWEEN MYSELF AND MY

01:38:12.686 --> 01:38:14.855
WIFE. YOU KNOW SHE'S A HOME

01:38:14.922 --> 01:38:15.656
WHERE WE'RE ALWAYS TALKING

01:38:15.723 --> 01:38:18.292
ABOUT THE YOU KNOW HER FAVORITE

01:38:18.359 --> 01:38:19.827
WORD IS RECYCLE RECYCLE

01:38:19.893 --> 01:38:23.464
ANALYSTS JUST A- YOU KNOW A-

01:38:23.530 --> 01:38:25.165
PUT THIS IN THE RECYCLING BIN

01:38:25.232 --> 01:38:27.101
WHERE YOU KNOW I. AM AFRAID I

01:38:27.167 --> 01:38:28.636
AM ALWAYS JOKING THAT SHE'S

01:38:28.702 --> 01:38:29.103
GOING TO PUT ME IN THE

01:38:29.169 --> 01:38:32.339
RECYCLING BIN SUNDAY. BUT YEAH.

01:38:32.406 --> 01:38:38.879
YOU'RE MORE COMPOST. IT'S WHAT

01:38:38.946 --> 01:38:43.817
AND- ACTUALLY GREAT BILL AGAIN

01:38:43.884 --> 01:38:45.252
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO BE ADDED

01:38:45.319 --> 01:38:46.520
AS A CO AUTHOR THANK YOU VERY

01:38:46.587 --> 01:38:49.023
MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FAR

01:38:49.089 --> 01:38:51.191
ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAY OUR TALK.

01:38:51.258 --> 01:38:52.660
SORRY IT ON THE I THINK

01:38:52.726 --> 01:38:54.028
RECYCLING IS PROBABLY ONE OF

01:38:54.094 --> 01:38:55.462
THE BIGGER CHALLENGES WE HAVE

01:38:55.529 --> 01:38:58.065
NATION. AND PART OF IT IS

01:38:58.132 --> 01:39:00.100
BECAUSE OUR APPROACH USED TO

01:39:00.167 --> 01:39:02.369
BE. THE STAFF WE DON'T WANT TO

01:39:02.436 --> 01:39:03.570
RECYCLE OR DON'T WANT TO

01:39:03.637 --> 01:39:05.439
DEVELOP THE TECHNOLOGY RECYCLE.

01:39:05.506 --> 01:39:06.874
WE JUST SHIPPED OTHER NATIONS

01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:08.976
AND HOPE THAT THEY WOULD DO

01:39:09.043 --> 01:39:12.046
SOMETHING WITH IT- AND THEY DID

01:39:12.112 --> 01:39:13.647
THEY PUT IT IN THE OCEAN SOON

01:39:13.714 --> 01:39:15.082
THEN FLOATED BACK ON THE OTHER.

01:39:15.149 --> 01:39:17.985
THAT'S RIGHT- SO WE'VE KIND OF

01:39:18.052 --> 01:39:19.286
LEARNED FROM THAT BUT- IN

01:39:19.353 --> 01:39:21.155
ORDER. FOR ME LOOKING THAT

01:39:21.221 --> 01:39:23.590
ENTIRE RECYCLING THING AND I'M

01:39:23.657 --> 01:39:24.958
GLAD TO SEE THE WASTE INDUSTRY

01:39:25.025 --> 01:39:27.127
IS FINALLY REPRESENTED. IN IN

01:39:27.194 --> 01:39:28.796
THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE IN

01:39:28.862 --> 01:39:29.496
THE PAST WE'VE DONE SOME

01:39:29.563 --> 01:39:31.265
LEGISLATION. THAT THEY WERE

01:39:31.332 --> 01:39:33.334
ABSOLUTELY EXCLUDED FROM AND

01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:34.535
NOW WE HAVE LEGISLATION THAT

01:39:34.601 --> 01:39:36.804
WE'RE HAVING A HARD TIME- IN

01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:38.272
ACTING BECAUSE THEY ARE AN

01:39:38.339 --> 01:39:40.140
INTEGRAL PART OF IT AND WE JUST

01:39:40.207 --> 01:39:42.443
DON'T HAVE. THE CAPACITY. OR

01:39:42.509 --> 01:39:46.280
THE- TECHNOLOGY TO DOA

01:39:46.347 --> 01:39:46.847
CONFLICT WHAT WE WANTED TO

01:39:46.914 --> 01:39:49.550
ACCOMPLISH. BUT ONE OF MY

01:39:49.616 --> 01:39:51.919
QUESTIONS IS. SO YOU KNOW THE

01:39:51.985 --> 01:39:53.087
OTHER STATES THAT HAVE THIS

01:39:53.153 --> 01:39:54.988
PACKAGING YOU KNOW THAT THE

01:39:55.055 --> 01:39:56.156
LABELING REQUIREMENTS AND

01:39:56.223 --> 01:39:59.293
THINGS. IS THE ISSUE THAT IT'S

01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:02.396
SIMPLY NOT. ARE RECYCLABLE OR

01:40:02.463 --> 01:40:06.433
REUSABLE OR IS IT THAT. THE

01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:09.670
TECHNOLOGY THAT'S REQUIRED IS

01:40:09.737 --> 01:40:12.840
NOT NECESSARILY- YEAH IS COST

01:40:12.906 --> 01:40:14.875
EFFECTIVE AND THEREFORE WE

01:40:14.942 --> 01:40:17.077
DON'T USE IT- BECAUSE OTHER

01:40:17.144 --> 01:40:18.879
STATES MAY FIND IT IS COST

01:40:18.946 --> 01:40:20.047
EFFECTIVE FOR THEM AND THEY ARE

01:40:20.114 --> 01:40:22.182
USING IT AND THEY DO HAVE A WAY

01:40:22.249 --> 01:40:23.717
OF TAKING SOME OF THE THINGS WE

01:40:23.784 --> 01:40:26.220
CONSIDER NOT TO BE RECYCLABLE.

01:40:26.286 --> 01:40:28.088
AND RECYCLING AND RE USING

01:40:28.155 --> 01:40:30.958
THOSE MATERIALS AND BECAUSE I

01:40:31.024 --> 01:40:32.092
THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

01:40:32.159 --> 01:40:34.461
HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF ARE ALSO

01:40:34.528 --> 01:40:36.063
IN CALIFORNIA IF WE'RE GOING TO

01:40:36.130 --> 01:40:37.931
SEPARATE OURSELVES FROM

01:40:37.998 --> 01:40:40.801
EVERYONE ELSE- THERE'S A COST

01:40:40.868 --> 01:40:42.770
TO DOING THAT AND THAT COST IS

01:40:42.836 --> 01:40:45.005
ADDED ON TO THE COST OF. LIVING

01:40:45.072 --> 01:40:46.306
HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS

01:40:46.373 --> 01:40:47.574
ALREADY HIGHER THAN A LOT OF

01:40:47.641 --> 01:40:50.277
DIFFERENT PLACES. AND THAT COST

01:40:50.344 --> 01:40:54.314
IS BORN- ESPECIALLY BY. YEAH

01:40:54.381 --> 01:40:56.150
YEAH YOU COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

01:40:56.216 --> 01:41:00.154
ARE- PREDOMINANTLY POOR. AND

01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:01.321
THEREFORE DON'T REALLY HAVE THE

01:41:01.388 --> 01:41:02.956
RESOURCES TO KEEP SPENDING MORE

01:41:03.023 --> 01:41:06.026
AND MORE MORE ON ON ON ON THEIR

01:41:06.093 --> 01:41:09.763
ON THEIR FOOD. SUPPLIES SO YOU

01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:10.397
KNOW THOSE ARE A COUPLE THINGS

01:41:10.464 --> 01:41:14.134
THAT CONCERN ME IS IT MAYBE YOU

01:41:14.201 --> 01:41:15.436
CAN ADDRESS THE FIRST ONE

01:41:15.502 --> 01:41:17.638
ABOUT- WHAT OTHER STATES ARE

01:41:17.704 --> 01:41:19.506
DOING. THAT WE MAY NOT BE

01:41:19.573 --> 01:41:22.075
DOING- SO WE CAN'T WE CONSIDER

01:41:22.142 --> 01:41:23.644
SOMETHING RECYCLABLE NOT

01:41:23.710 --> 01:41:25.679
RECYCLABLE WHILE THEY DO. YEAH

01:41:25.746 --> 01:41:27.848
SO. AND THEN I'D LOVE IT IF YOU

01:41:27.915 --> 01:41:29.450
COULD COULD. YOU HAVE REPEAT

01:41:29.516 --> 01:41:33.220
THAT THAT. THAT EQUITY QUESTION

01:41:33.287 --> 01:41:33.821
YES AT THE END BECAUSE I DON'T

01:41:33.887 --> 01:41:34.421
KNOW THAT I. FULLER ABOUT THE

01:41:34.488 --> 01:41:37.524
FIRST QUESTION. I'M SO. THAT WE

01:41:37.591 --> 01:41:39.326
YOUR CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY DOES

01:41:39.393 --> 01:41:41.094
HAVE ONE OF THE BEST SYSTEMS-

01:41:41.161 --> 01:41:43.063
IT'S A COMBINATION OF SEVERAL

01:41:43.130 --> 01:41:45.399
FACTORS IN. LARGELY THE SECOND

01:41:45.466 --> 01:41:46.467
WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS

01:41:46.533 --> 01:41:49.436
OF. COST EFFECTIVENESS- AND

01:41:49.503 --> 01:41:51.071
THEN OF COURSE AND MARKETS

01:41:51.138 --> 01:41:52.406
RIGHT SO THAT THEY GO HAND IN

01:41:52.473 --> 01:41:53.974
HAND IF YOU CAN'T FIND IN A

01:41:54.041 --> 01:41:55.275
MARKET TO SELL THE PRODUCTS

01:41:55.342 --> 01:41:56.977
AND- YOU COULD SPEND VERY

01:41:57.044 --> 01:41:58.278
LITTLE ON RECYCLING AND IT

01:41:58.345 --> 01:41:59.480
STILL ISN'T GOING TO PENCIL

01:41:59.546 --> 01:42:01.281
OUT. RIGHT SO YOU'VE GOT IT YOU

01:42:01.348 --> 01:42:01.849
GOT IT YOU GOT TO STRIKE A

01:42:01.915 --> 01:42:03.851
BALANCE HERE. AND IN THE END OF

01:42:03.917 --> 01:42:06.653
THE DAY- THE MOST OF THE ITEMS

01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:08.222
THAT HAVE THE RECYCLING SYMBOL

01:42:08.288 --> 01:42:09.923
WITH THE THREE THREE SEVEN.

01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:12.159
NUMBER IN THE MIDDLE. MOST OF

01:42:12.226 --> 01:42:13.794
THEM ARE TECHNICALLY RECYCLABLE

01:42:13.861 --> 01:42:16.697
UNDER UNDER PERFECT CONDITIONS-

01:42:16.763 --> 01:42:19.299
BUT FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS

01:42:19.366 --> 01:42:20.267
IT'S JUST THEY ARE NOT BEING

01:42:20.334 --> 01:42:22.669
RECYCLED- IT IT IT'S ULTIMATELY

01:42:22.736 --> 01:42:23.670
IT'S AS YOU SAY IT'S A

01:42:23.737 --> 01:42:26.006
COMBINATION OF. OF COST

01:42:26.073 --> 01:42:29.176
EFFECTIVENESS TECHNOLOGY AND

01:42:29.243 --> 01:42:30.878
MARKETS. I'M YEAH THE SORTING

01:42:30.944 --> 01:42:33.514
SYSTEM. OBVIOUSLY IF WE HAD

01:42:33.580 --> 01:42:34.781
SOMETHING MORE COMPREHENSIVE I

01:42:34.848 --> 01:42:36.283
MEAN YOU KNOW FOLKS MAY KNOW

01:42:36.350 --> 01:42:37.317
THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH A

01:42:37.384 --> 01:42:38.519
NUMBER OF YOU ONE ON UP ON A

01:42:38.585 --> 01:42:40.320
BROADER PLAY IN THIS AREA WITH

01:42:40.387 --> 01:42:43.257
SB FIFTY FOUR. FIVE AND THE

01:42:43.323 --> 01:42:43.857
IDEAS WITH THAT BILL THAT WE

01:42:43.924 --> 01:42:45.492
WOULD HAVE JUST. MORE

01:42:45.559 --> 01:42:46.894
SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS IN THE

01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:48.061
SYSTEM WRIT LARGE AND THAT

01:42:48.128 --> 01:42:50.030
WOULD ACTUALLY HELP TO. TO

01:42:50.097 --> 01:42:51.331
CHANGE OUR SYSTEM SAYS THAT

01:42:51.398 --> 01:42:53.133
THERE. IS SUCH THAT WE WOULDN'T

01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:55.369
HAVE. QUITE THE SAME SORTING.

01:42:55.435 --> 01:42:57.104
AND RESTRUCTURING I CHALLENGES

01:42:57.170 --> 01:42:58.705
THAT THEY CURRENTLY MAKE SO

01:42:58.772 --> 01:43:00.207
MUCH OF RECYCLING COPS COST

01:43:00.274 --> 01:43:02.776
PROHIBITIVE- BUT WE DO HAVE ONE

01:43:02.843 --> 01:43:03.343
OF THE BEST SYSTEMS IN THE

01:43:03.410 --> 01:43:07.147
COUNTRY- YOU KNOW. THE I

01:43:07.214 --> 01:43:09.216
HAVEN'T. BEEN PRESENTED WITH A

01:43:09.283 --> 01:43:10.284
CASE WHERE THERE'S ANOTHER

01:43:10.350 --> 01:43:12.052
STATE THAT HAPPENS TO HAVE A

01:43:12.119 --> 01:43:13.687
VERY EFFECTIVE RECYCLING SYSTEM

01:43:13.754 --> 01:43:15.222
FOR A PARTICULAR RESIN TYPE.

01:43:15.289 --> 01:43:16.924
THAT WE DON'T HAVE. THAT THIS

01:43:16.990 --> 01:43:19.326
WOULD JAM UP. I'M I'M CERTAINLY

01:43:19.393 --> 01:43:20.827
HAPPY TO IF THERE IS A CASE OF

01:43:20.894 --> 01:43:21.828
LIKE THAT MAYBE WE CAN FIGURE

01:43:21.895 --> 01:43:23.263
OUT A WAY TO ENSURE THAT.

01:43:23.330 --> 01:43:24.331
BECAUSE I THINK I WANT TO DO IS

01:43:24.398 --> 01:43:27.134
JAM UP A GOOD. RECYCLING SYSTEM

01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:27.701
THAT MIGHT EXIST IN ANOTHER

01:43:27.768 --> 01:43:28.302
STATE MAYBE THERE'S A WAY WE

01:43:28.368 --> 01:43:30.070
COULD. YOU TWEAK THAT TWEET THE

01:43:30.137 --> 01:43:31.905
BILL TO ACCOMMODATE THAT WE DO

01:43:31.972 --> 01:43:33.273
HAVE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL IN

01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:35.108
ITS ITS ALLUDED TO ON PAGE TWO

01:43:35.175 --> 01:43:37.044
OF THE ANALYSIS WHICH- INVOLVES

01:43:37.110 --> 01:43:38.612
THESE THE- YOU KNOW IF A

01:43:38.679 --> 01:43:40.480
PRODUCER. CAN COME FORWARD.

01:43:40.547 --> 01:43:41.381
WITH THAT WITH SOME SORT OF

01:43:41.448 --> 01:43:43.917
PLAN- IF THEY IF THEY FEEL AS

01:43:43.984 --> 01:43:45.252
THOUGH- YOU KNOW THAT THERE

01:43:45.319 --> 01:43:46.720
THERE IS AN EMERGING MARKET FOR

01:43:46.787 --> 01:43:47.321
EXAMPLE IN ONE OF THESE OTHER

01:43:47.387 --> 01:43:49.489
RESIN TYPES. THAT HASN'T BEEN

01:43:49.556 --> 01:43:51.191
COVERED- BY THE BILL THEY CAN

01:43:51.258 --> 01:43:52.292
COME FOR WITH THE PLAN TO WORK

01:43:52.359 --> 01:43:53.994
WITH CAL RECYCLE TO GET. TO GET

01:43:54.061 --> 01:43:55.662
IT INCLUDED- SO THERE IS

01:43:55.729 --> 01:43:57.264
FLEXIBILITY THAT WE OFFER BUT

01:43:57.331 --> 01:43:59.232
WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT-

01:43:59.299 --> 01:44:01.134
THAT THE YEAR THE- THE ITEMS

01:44:01.201 --> 01:44:02.169
ARE REALLY BEING RECYCLED I

01:44:02.235 --> 01:44:03.537
MEAN BECAUSE ONLY- GARCIA'S

01:44:03.604 --> 01:44:04.972
ABSOLUTE RIGHT THIS IDEA THAT

01:44:05.038 --> 01:44:05.839
SOMEHOW THIS IS GOING TO LEAD

01:44:05.906 --> 01:44:07.207
TO MORE LANDFILLING. THE FACT

01:44:07.274 --> 01:44:08.208
IS ALL THIS ALL THIS THAT IS

01:44:08.275 --> 01:44:09.476
GOING TO LANDFILL ANYWAY AND IF

01:44:09.543 --> 01:44:10.811
ANYTHING ALL IT'S DOING IS

01:44:10.877 --> 01:44:12.512
MAKING IT LESS LIKELY. FOR THE

01:44:12.579 --> 01:44:13.680
ONES AND TWOS THAT REALLY ARE

01:44:13.747 --> 01:44:15.916
RECYCLABLE. THEY'RE ACTUALLY

01:44:15.983 --> 01:44:16.650
GETTING PROPERLY SORTED AND

01:44:16.717 --> 01:44:18.552
RECYCLED. AND THAT'S THAT'S THE

01:44:18.619 --> 01:44:20.887
SAD REALITY AND DONE ONE OF THE

01:44:20.954 --> 01:44:22.155
THINGS ABOUT RECYCLING YOU KNOW

01:44:22.222 --> 01:44:23.190
WHEN YOU GO TO A RECYCLING

01:44:23.256 --> 01:44:24.691
CENTER WHEN YOU GO TO ADOPT.

01:44:24.758 --> 01:44:26.727
YOU REALIZED THAT THE YOU KNOW

01:44:26.793 --> 01:44:31.865
YOU CAN SPEND SO MUCH TIME.

01:44:31.932 --> 01:44:32.466
JUST YOU'RE PERFECTLY CLEANING

01:44:32.532 --> 01:44:33.066
UP THEY'RE PEOPLE WHO WASH ALL

01:44:33.133 --> 01:44:33.667
THEIR AYE. BEFORE THEY PUT IN

01:44:33.734 --> 01:44:34.267
THE RECYCLING. TO THE CHANCE

01:44:34.334 --> 01:44:35.502
RECYCLE. IN AND THAT'S A GOOD

01:44:35.569 --> 01:44:37.070
THING TO DO BUT- YOU KNOW WHEN

01:44:37.137 --> 01:44:38.271
YOU GO TO THIS WHEN YOU WHEN

01:44:38.338 --> 01:44:39.606
YOU GO AND SEE THE SYSTEM WRIT

01:44:39.673 --> 01:44:41.108
LARGE YOU SEE HOW IT'S ALL. O

01:44:41.174 --> 01:44:42.643
THE CONVEYOR BELT TOGETHER. AND

01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:43.744
THERE'S JUST. THESE THESE

01:44:43.810 --> 01:44:45.712
MACHINES AND MAGNETS AND PEOPLE

01:44:45.779 --> 01:44:48.682
SORTING AND IT'S A IT'S A BALK

01:44:48.749 --> 01:44:52.386
SYSTEM- AND- YOU KNOW. IT'S IT

01:44:52.452 --> 01:44:53.420
IS TRUE THERE WILL PROBABLY BE

01:44:53.487 --> 01:44:55.255
A COUPLE LITTLE ITEMS THAT WILL

01:44:55.322 --> 01:44:56.590
NOT GET RECYCLED THAT WE'RE

01:44:56.657 --> 01:44:58.725
GONNA GET RECYCLED UNDER- IF AS

01:44:58.792 --> 01:45:00.060
A RESULT THIS BILL PASSING BUT

01:45:00.127 --> 01:45:00.961
THE FACT OF MATTER IS THE

01:45:01.028 --> 01:45:02.629
SYSTEM IS SO MASSIVE ITSELF

01:45:02.696 --> 01:45:05.932
MACRO. ON ALL THOSE ITEMS THAT

01:45:05.999 --> 01:45:08.568
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE

01:45:08.635 --> 01:45:09.269
THREE THREE SEVENS ARE NOT

01:45:09.336 --> 01:45:10.337
GETTING RECYCLED AND THEY'RE

01:45:10.404 --> 01:45:11.405
ACTUALLY MAKING IT HARDER TO

01:45:11.471 --> 01:45:12.673
RECYCLE THE ONES AND TWOS IF WE

01:45:12.739 --> 01:45:14.975
HAVE IF WE ARE IF OUR GOAL IS.

01:45:15.042 --> 01:45:16.810
ZERO WASTE AND RECYCLING

01:45:16.877 --> 01:45:18.211
EVERYTHING THEN THE

01:45:18.278 --> 01:45:20.347
TECHNOLOGIES FOR THOSE HAVE TO

01:45:20.414 --> 01:45:21.848
BE EMPLOYED IN OPEN WHEN

01:45:21.915 --> 01:45:22.382
THERE'S NO MARKET FOR THE

01:45:22.449 --> 01:45:24.484
TECHNOLOGY. THAT'S WHEN

01:45:24.551 --> 01:45:26.086
GOVERNMENT HAS TO STEP IN IF

01:45:26.153 --> 01:45:28.355
THAT'S THE IF IT'S IF IT'S THAT

01:45:28.422 --> 01:45:30.357
IMPORTANT FOR THE- PUBLIC. TO

01:45:30.424 --> 01:45:32.092
BE ABLE TO DO THAT I DO I WE

01:45:32.159 --> 01:45:33.026
NEED TO STOP SKIRTING AROUND

01:45:33.093 --> 01:45:35.362
THAT PART. WELL IN THAT POLICY

01:45:35.429 --> 01:45:36.797
HAS TO BE DEALT WITH SOME I

01:45:36.863 --> 01:45:37.731
APPRECIATE YOU ANSWERING THE

01:45:37.798 --> 01:45:39.066
QUESTION YOU DID ANSWER THAT

01:45:39.132 --> 01:45:40.000
ONE QUESTION WHICH IS YES

01:45:40.067 --> 01:45:41.435
THERE'S A LOT OF RECYCLE STUFF

01:45:41.501 --> 01:45:43.403
THAT WE JUST. CHOOSE NOT TO.

01:45:43.470 --> 01:45:44.805
ADD BASIC WHAT I WILL SAY

01:45:44.871 --> 01:45:46.973
ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS. TO THE

01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:49.176
EXTENT WE CAN. RIGHT IF WE DO

01:45:49.242 --> 01:45:50.911
WANNA RECYCLE EVERYTHING. THE

01:45:50.977 --> 01:45:53.346
PRODUCERS SHOULD BE SHIFTING TO

01:45:53.413 --> 01:45:54.815
THE HIGHLY RECYCLABLE RESIN

01:45:54.881 --> 01:45:57.017
TYPES RIGHT. SO THERE ARE LOTS

01:45:57.084 --> 01:45:58.151
AND LOTS OF PRODUCTS THAT COULD

01:45:58.218 --> 01:46:00.153
JUST AS EASILY BE MADE WITH A

01:46:00.220 --> 01:46:01.421
THREE AS WITH THE ONE. AND

01:46:01.488 --> 01:46:02.889
THERE ARE EXAMPLES OF PRODUCERS

01:46:02.956 --> 01:46:03.957
WHO HAVE SHIFTED FROM A ONE TWO

01:46:04.024 --> 01:46:07.227
OR THREE. SIMPLY FOR AESTHETIC

01:46:07.294 --> 01:46:08.995
REASONS. AND THAT DECISION.

01:46:09.062 --> 01:46:10.363
RENDERS THAT ITEM NON

01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:12.699
RECYCLABLE JUST LIKE THAT. WE

01:46:12.766 --> 01:46:13.700
SHOULD BE DOING EVERYTHING WE

01:46:13.767 --> 01:46:15.736
CAN. TO INTO TO THE EXTENT

01:46:15.802 --> 01:46:16.770
POSSIBLE TO ENCOURAGE

01:46:16.837 --> 01:46:18.572
PRODUCERS. WHO ARE IN THE

01:46:18.638 --> 01:46:21.074
PLASTIC SPACE TO BE. PRODUCING

01:46:21.141 --> 01:46:22.042
THEIR PRODUCTS USING THE ONES

01:46:22.109 --> 01:46:23.710
AND TWOS. WHICH ARE HIGHLY

01:46:23.777 --> 01:46:25.579
RECYCLABLE AND- OBVIOUSLY

01:46:25.645 --> 01:46:27.214
THAT'S A BIG PART OF THE GOAL

01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:28.915
OF FIFTY FOUR TO BE HONEST SB

01:46:28.982 --> 01:46:30.250
FIFTY FOUR BUT- BUT TO THE YOU

01:46:30.317 --> 01:46:32.018
TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS IS.

01:46:32.085 --> 01:46:33.086
IMPOSING SOME TRUTH IN

01:46:33.153 --> 01:46:35.322
LABELING. IF PRODUCERS DO CARE

01:46:35.388 --> 01:46:36.790
ABOUT REAL RECYCLABILITY IN AND

01:46:36.857 --> 01:46:37.758
SHOWING THAT FACE TO THE

01:46:37.824 --> 01:46:39.693
PUBLIC. I TO THE EXTENT THEY

01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:40.627
CAN DAY WELL UNDER THIS BILL

01:46:40.694 --> 01:46:42.863
START. USING MORE THE ONES AND

01:46:42.929 --> 01:46:44.498
TWOS RATHER THAN THE NON

01:46:44.564 --> 01:46:47.067
RECYCLABLE PLASTICS IS THERE A

01:46:47.134 --> 01:46:48.702
PRODUCT COST TO THEM. IT

01:46:48.769 --> 01:46:50.237
TOTALLY DEPENDS ON THE PRODUCT

01:46:50.303 --> 01:46:50.771
IT TOTALLY DEPENDS ON THE

01:46:50.837 --> 01:46:55.308
PRODUCT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FLOOR

01:46:55.375 --> 01:46:57.444
SOMETIMES NO THANK YOU MADAM

01:46:57.511 --> 01:46:59.379
CHAIR- CENTER I THINK IT'S

01:46:59.446 --> 01:47:00.547
PROBABLY SAFE TO SAY WHEN YOU

01:47:00.614 --> 01:47:01.548
FIRST GOT ELECTED THAT YOU

01:47:01.615 --> 01:47:03.250
WOULDN'T JUST GO DOWN RECYCLING

01:47:03.316 --> 01:47:04.317
PROBABLY WASN'T THE REASON I

01:47:04.384 --> 01:47:06.920
NOW FROM HOUSE I KNOW YOU HAVE.

01:47:06.987 --> 01:47:08.455
RUINED MY LIFE ABSOLUTELY

01:47:08.522 --> 01:47:10.557
BECOME RUSSIA AND I THINK IT'S

01:47:10.624 --> 01:47:12.425
KIND OF COOL- BECAUSE IT IS

01:47:12.492 --> 01:47:13.393
SUCH A HUGE PROBLEM AND YOU

01:47:13.460 --> 01:47:15.729
HAVE DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB OF

01:47:15.796 --> 01:47:17.697
TRYING TO FIND BALANCE. SO I

01:47:17.764 --> 01:47:19.366
WANTED TO MAKE SURE- TO SAY

01:47:19.432 --> 01:47:20.834
THAT TO YOU PERSONALLY BECAUSE

01:47:20.901 --> 01:47:21.234
I DO BELIEVE THAT

01:47:21.301 --> 01:47:22.569
WHOLEHEARTEDLY WE'VE HAD MANY

01:47:22.636 --> 01:47:24.871
CONVERSATIONS ON MULTIPLE TRIPS

01:47:24.938 --> 01:47:26.973
TALK ABOUT THIS AMAZING TOPIC I

01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:28.775
AM CURIOUS THOUGH LIKE ON THE

01:47:28.842 --> 01:47:30.944
LIMITED RESIN A COUPLE TIMES

01:47:31.011 --> 01:47:32.712
YOU KNOW WHAT IT TAKES TO TAKE

01:47:32.779 --> 01:47:34.581
A QUARTER COULD NOT RECYCLE

01:47:34.648 --> 01:47:35.749
PRODUCT WE KNOW THAT WE CAN

01:47:35.816 --> 01:47:36.583
RECYCLE PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING

01:47:36.650 --> 01:47:39.219
IF WE REDUCE IT DOWN BACK DOWN

01:47:39.286 --> 01:47:40.687
TO. YOU KNOW PUREST FORM

01:47:40.754 --> 01:47:42.756
INTERESTED WE CAN INJECT THAT

01:47:42.823 --> 01:47:45.792
AGAIN AND MAKE A PRODUCT OUT OF

01:47:45.859 --> 01:47:46.326
THAT AGAIN. THE STATE OF

01:47:46.393 --> 01:47:47.861
CALIFORNIA WE DO NOT HAVE A TON

01:47:47.928 --> 01:47:49.196
OF THOSE FACILITIES AVAILABLE

01:47:49.262 --> 01:47:52.098
TO DO THIS. AND THIS IS ONE

01:47:52.165 --> 01:47:53.366
THING THAT I AM VERY CONCERNED

01:47:53.433 --> 01:47:55.035
ABOUT IS AS WE REMOVE ALL THE

01:47:55.101 --> 01:47:56.770
STUFF FROM THE STREAM THAT I

01:47:56.837 --> 01:47:57.504
COMPLETELY AGREE THAT WE NEED

01:47:57.571 --> 01:47:59.072
TO. WE DO NOT HAVE THE

01:47:59.139 --> 01:48:00.173
INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE TO

01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:01.208
ACTUALLY DEAL WITH THIS TO TAKE

01:48:01.274 --> 01:48:02.375
THESE QUOTE UNQUOTE BECAUSE WE

01:48:02.442 --> 01:48:03.577
ALL KNOW THAT PRETTY MUCH

01:48:03.643 --> 01:48:05.312
EVERYTHING IS RECYCLABLE TO A

01:48:05.378 --> 01:48:06.713
CERTAIN DEGREE WE CAN REDUCE

01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:08.048
THAT DOWN TO A PETROLEUM

01:48:08.114 --> 01:48:10.417
PRODUCT. AND REUSE IT AGAIN WE

01:48:10.483 --> 01:48:11.785
DO NOT HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:48:11.852 --> 01:48:12.786
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO

01:48:12.853 --> 01:48:14.721
DO THAT WHICH IS WHY WE SHIP IT

01:48:14.788 --> 01:48:15.589
OVERSEAS AND LET THEM DEAL WITH

01:48:15.655 --> 01:48:18.425
IT. SO I AM CURIOUS WHAT ARE

01:48:18.491 --> 01:48:20.627
YOUR THOUGHTS ON. TRYING TO

01:48:20.694 --> 01:48:22.429
BUILD UP THE INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:48:22.495 --> 01:48:25.498
WITHIN OUR STATE. TO DEAL WITH

01:48:25.565 --> 01:48:27.234
THIS BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S

01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:28.602
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT PART OF

01:48:28.668 --> 01:48:31.905
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIX- I

01:48:31.972 --> 01:48:33.807
ACTUALLY AGREE- THERE THERE

01:48:33.874 --> 01:48:36.276
ISN'T INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGE-

01:48:36.343 --> 01:48:37.210
I GUESS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS

01:48:37.277 --> 01:48:39.346
BECOMES. TO WHAT EXTENT

01:48:39.412 --> 01:48:41.114
ESPECIALLY FOR THE FOR THE

01:48:41.181 --> 01:48:42.382
TECHNICALLY RECYCLABLE BUT VERY

01:48:42.449 --> 01:48:44.551
HARD TO RECYCLE PRODUCTS TO

01:48:44.618 --> 01:48:46.620
WHAT EXTENT IS IT WORTH. REALLY

01:48:46.686 --> 01:48:48.421
DOUBLING DOWN ON INVESTING IN

01:48:48.488 --> 01:48:49.456
THAT PARTICULAR TYPE OF

01:48:49.522 --> 01:48:50.457
STRUCTURE AS OPPOSED TO

01:48:50.523 --> 01:48:51.791
ENCOURAGING US PRODUCERS TO

01:48:51.858 --> 01:48:52.626
MOVE TO MORE RECYCLABLE

01:48:52.692 --> 01:48:54.261
PRODUCTS SO THAT'S ANOTHER PART

01:48:54.327 --> 01:48:54.828
OF THE COST BENEFIT BECAUSE

01:48:54.895 --> 01:48:56.463
THERE ARE AS I SAY. WELL YOU'RE

01:48:56.529 --> 01:48:57.964
RIGHT EVERYTHING TO SOME EXTENT

01:48:58.031 --> 01:48:59.165
IS RECYCLABLE LEAST THE ONES

01:48:59.232 --> 01:49:01.001
WITH THIS YOU KNOW THE

01:49:01.067 --> 01:49:02.636
RECYCLING SYMBOLS ON THEM. SOME

01:49:02.702 --> 01:49:03.169
ARE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE TO

01:49:03.236 --> 01:49:05.572
RECYCLE. THAN OTHERS AND SO

01:49:05.639 --> 01:49:07.207
SHOULD WE BE MORE YAK SHIFTING

01:49:07.274 --> 01:49:08.408
PEOPLE TOWARD THE MORE

01:49:08.475 --> 01:49:10.410
RECYCLABLE STUFF. OUT TO THE

01:49:10.477 --> 01:49:12.679
EXTENT FEASIBLE- BUT YOUR UPS

01:49:12.746 --> 01:49:13.780
RIGHT THE RESEARCH IS A BIG

01:49:13.847 --> 01:49:15.682
PART OF THIS I THINK YOU KNOW

01:49:15.749 --> 01:49:16.616
ONE OF THE ONE OF THE THOUGHTS

01:49:16.683 --> 01:49:18.685
I THINK AS WE- ARE BUT WITH

01:49:18.752 --> 01:49:21.087
BILLS LIKE THIS BUT CERTAINLY-

01:49:21.154 --> 01:49:22.555
CERTAINLY WITH SB FIFTY FOUR.

01:49:22.622 --> 01:49:24.925
AB TEN EIGHTY- THE IDEA HAS

01:49:24.991 --> 01:49:26.726
BEEN TO TRY TO CREATE AN

01:49:26.793 --> 01:49:28.261
ATMOSPHERE. WHERE THERE'S A

01:49:28.328 --> 01:49:34.567
REAL INCENTIVE. ACTUALLY

01:49:34.634 --> 01:49:35.769
PRODUCE THEIR PRODUCTS WITH THE

01:49:35.835 --> 01:49:37.337
MIND TOWARD RECYCLING. AND

01:49:37.404 --> 01:49:38.805
AGAIN THE COLLECTION PROCESS IN

01:49:38.872 --> 01:49:40.407
THE SORTING PROCESS WITH THE

01:49:40.473 --> 01:49:44.344
MIND TOWARD RECYCLING. I'M SO

01:49:44.411 --> 01:49:46.379
YOU KNOW IT'S A IT'S A- AND I

01:49:46.446 --> 01:49:47.213
WILL SAY THERE ARE A LOT OF

01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:48.281
PLACES AROUND THE WORLD WITH

01:49:48.348 --> 01:49:48.815
THE FREELY TAKING MORE

01:49:48.882 --> 01:49:50.083
AGGRESSIVE ACTION IN THIS AREA

01:49:50.150 --> 01:49:51.818
WHERE THE- WHERE THE PRODUCERS.

01:49:51.885 --> 01:49:54.120
HAVE CREATED. COME HOLISTIC

01:49:54.187 --> 01:49:56.389
SYSTEMS. AND BECAUSE THEY KNOW

01:49:56.456 --> 01:49:58.024
THEIR OWN PRODUCTS THEY'RE ABLE

01:49:58.091 --> 01:50:00.493
TO- TO BUILD. A COLLECTION

01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:02.028
SORTING SYSTEM AND AN

01:50:02.095 --> 01:50:03.196
ULTIMATELY RECYCLING SYSTEM

01:50:03.263 --> 01:50:04.264
THAT THAT IS MORE COST

01:50:04.331 --> 01:50:06.399
EFFECTIVE. THAN THE SYSTEM THAT

01:50:06.466 --> 01:50:09.569
WE HAVE. SO BUT YOU KNOW I KNOW

01:50:09.636 --> 01:50:10.103
THIS INFRASTRUCTURE

01:50:10.170 --> 01:50:11.538
CONVERSATION IS HAPPENING IN A

01:50:11.604 --> 01:50:13.540
ROBUST MANNER- ON BOTH BOTH

01:50:13.606 --> 01:50:15.976
SIDES OF OUR BUILDING. AND IF

01:50:16.042 --> 01:50:16.977
IT IS ACTUALLY AN ESSENTIAL

01:50:17.043 --> 01:50:18.511
PART OF THE STORY- BUT THE

01:50:18.578 --> 01:50:20.180
PRODUCERS HAVE TO BE AT THE

01:50:20.246 --> 01:50:20.814
TABLE AND THEY HAVE TO BE PART

01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:22.282
OF THE SOLUTION. I COMPLETELY

01:50:22.349 --> 01:50:23.483
AGREE WITH THAT I THINK YOU

01:50:23.550 --> 01:50:25.085
KNOW I JUST I WAS USING MY

01:50:25.151 --> 01:50:26.086
BACKGROUND AND COMING FROM THE

01:50:26.152 --> 01:50:27.253
OUTSIDE WORLD. YOU THIS

01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:28.488
CHARACTERISES THE STICK

01:50:28.555 --> 01:50:30.590
APPROACH SEEMS TO REALLY WORK.

01:50:30.657 --> 01:50:31.691
AND I YOU KNOW IF WE CAN

01:50:31.758 --> 01:50:33.226
ENCOURAGE THE PRODUCERS THE

01:50:33.293 --> 01:50:34.828
MANUFACTURE OF THESE PRODUCTS

01:50:34.894 --> 01:50:36.129
AND COME ALONG LIKE A PUBLIC

01:50:36.196 --> 01:50:37.230
PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP TO BUILD

01:50:37.297 --> 01:50:38.698
THESE KIND OF INSTRUCTORS THAT

01:50:38.765 --> 01:50:40.633
ARE REQUIRED TO DO THIS. YES IT

01:50:40.700 --> 01:50:42.736
IS A TREMENDOUS COST TO RECYCLE

01:50:42.802 --> 01:50:44.571
SOME OF THE HARDER- PRODUCTS

01:50:44.637 --> 01:50:46.072
YOU KNOW WE UNDERSTAND THAT.

01:50:46.139 --> 01:50:48.241
BUT IF THE STATE IS GOING TO

01:50:48.308 --> 01:50:49.943
MAKE THIS A PRIORITY THEY WERE

01:50:50.010 --> 01:50:52.112
GOING TO DROP THESE MANDATES.

01:50:52.178 --> 01:50:52.846
BUT I THINK WE NEED TO PARTNER

01:50:52.912 --> 01:50:54.614
WITH OUR INDUSTRIES- AT A

01:50:54.681 --> 01:50:57.217
STATE. LEVEL TO GET THIS THESE

01:50:57.283 --> 01:50:58.218
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE

01:50:58.284 --> 01:50:59.219
FACILITIES UP AND RUNNING AS

01:50:59.285 --> 01:51:00.387
QUICK AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE

01:51:00.453 --> 01:51:02.155
OTHERWISE. WE'RE GONNA KEEP

01:51:02.222 --> 01:51:03.490
FIGHTING THE SAME BATTLE AND WE

01:51:03.556 --> 01:51:04.290
CAN KEEP WONDERING WHY

01:51:04.357 --> 01:51:06.159
NOTHING'S REALLY CHANGED AND

01:51:06.226 --> 01:51:07.127
PUTTING IT ALL ON THE BACK OF

01:51:07.193 --> 01:51:08.361
INDUSTRY FOR THE INDUSTRY TO

01:51:08.428 --> 01:51:10.063
DEAL WITH IT. I DON'T THINK IS

01:51:10.130 --> 01:51:12.032
THE RIGHT. WAY BECAUSE AT THE

01:51:12.098 --> 01:51:13.533
END OF THE DAY BUT THE COST OF

01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:15.068
LIVING ISSUE. I MEAN THE OTHER

01:51:15.135 --> 01:51:16.803
DAY IF INDUSTRY HAS TO PAY X.

01:51:16.870 --> 01:51:18.238
AMOUNT DOLLARS MORE FREE

01:51:18.304 --> 01:51:19.739
PACKAGE TO PACKAGE SOMETHING

01:51:19.806 --> 01:51:22.075
THAT MY COMMUNITY BUYS- THAT IS

01:51:22.142 --> 01:51:23.309
PROBLEMATIC O I APPRECIATE

01:51:23.376 --> 01:51:26.079
YOUR EFFORTS IN THIS AND- LOOK

01:51:26.146 --> 01:51:26.613
FORWARD TO IT AS IT MOVES

01:51:26.679 --> 01:51:28.515
FORWARD. MY ITS OWNER IT BUT IF

01:51:28.581 --> 01:51:29.849
I MAY IT IS ALREADY ACOSTA

01:51:29.916 --> 01:51:30.984
LIVING ISSUE AND IT'S HITTING

01:51:31.051 --> 01:51:33.086
OUR CONSTITUENTS RIGHT NOW. I

01:51:33.153 --> 01:51:34.354
AS I MENTIONED SEVENTY

01:51:34.421 --> 01:51:36.222
SOMETHING LIKE SEVENTY PERCENT-

01:51:36.289 --> 01:51:37.757
A NEW A NEARLY THREE QUARTERS

01:51:37.824 --> 01:51:39.659
OF CITIES ARE ABOUT TO INCREASE

01:51:39.726 --> 01:51:40.226
THEIR RATES FOR WASTE

01:51:40.293 --> 01:51:41.928
COLLECTION. AT LOTS OF

01:51:41.995 --> 01:51:42.695
JURISDICTIONS ALREADY HAVE BY

01:51:42.762 --> 01:51:44.497
QUITE A BIT OUR OUR

01:51:44.564 --> 01:51:46.132
CONSTITUENTS ARE ALREADY PAYING

01:51:46.199 --> 01:51:47.667
A DID A DID AN INORDINATE

01:51:47.734 --> 01:51:50.170
AMOUNT OF MONEY. TO BANDAID

01:51:50.236 --> 01:51:53.173
OVER OUR BROKEN SYSTEM- ITSELF.

01:51:53.239 --> 01:51:54.474
SO THAT'S SOMETHING TO KEEP IN

01:51:54.541 --> 01:51:55.341
MIND TOO WHEN PEOPLE KEEP ON

01:51:55.408 --> 01:51:56.476
THE PRODUCERS I SAY THOUGH THIS

01:51:56.543 --> 01:51:58.311
MAY INCREASE THE COST OF ITEMS-

01:51:58.378 --> 01:52:01.448
I'M- INTO. THE THAT'S TRUE BUT

01:52:01.514 --> 01:52:02.048
BUT OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE

01:52:02.115 --> 01:52:03.583
ALREADY PAYING. AND THEIR PAY

01:52:03.650 --> 01:52:10.190
MORE AND MORE. ARE. ON THE WAY

01:52:10.256 --> 01:52:10.757
ON THE WASTE COLLECTION RATE

01:52:10.824 --> 01:52:13.560
SIDE. ANY OTHER. FROM MEMBERS

01:52:13.626 --> 01:52:15.595
OKAY. I JUST WANNA THANK YOU

WORK. ON THE RECYCLING OF

01:52:23.937 --> 01:52:26.039

PROVIDE THE CLARITY THAT

01:52:33.513 --> 01:52:35.615
CONSUMERS NEED TO UNDERSTAND

01:52:35.682 --> 01:52:37.217
WHAT IS RECYCLABLE AND WHAT

01:52:37.283 --> 01:52:39.152
ISN'T. I KNOW IN MY HOUSEHOLD.

GOT TO THE SENATE BOB WHICH OF

02:15:21.446 --> 02:15:23.515
COURSE WAS ON REASONABLE. AT

02:15:23.582 --> 02:15:27.586
THE TIME- THEY BASICALLY SAID

02:15:27.652 --> 02:15:29.754
HALF THE STAKEHOLDER SAID IF

02:15:29.821 --> 02:15:31.289

02:15:53.245 --> 02:15:56.748
INFORMATION TO SET A BASELINE.

02:15:56.815 --> 02:15:58.817
AND WE DID THAT AND THE OTHER

02:15:58.884 --> 02:16:00.619
THING THAT WAS INTERESTING. IS

02:16:00.685 --> 02:16:02.854
WHEN WE- HAVE THE OCEAN

02:16:02.921 --> 02:16:04.990
PROTECTION COUNCIL MEETING. TO

02:16:05.056 --> 02:16:06.892
ACCEPT THAT SCIENTIFIC STUDY ON

02:16:06.958 --> 02:16:09.394
SEA LEVEL RISE IT WAS GAVELED

02:16:09.461 --> 02:16:11.296
TO ORDER AT NINE O'CLOCK WHEN

02:16:11.363 --> 02:16:12.931
THE TSUNAMI HIT THE CALIFORNIA

02:16:12.998 --> 02:16:15.066
COAST AT EIGHT AM THAT MORNING

02:16:15.133 --> 02:16:16.968
COMING FROM JAPAN. WHICH

02:16:17.035 --> 02:16:19.371
ACCENTUATED THE EXACT ISSUES OF

02:16:19.437 --> 02:16:23.742
SEA LEVEL RISE- BECAUSE- IT IS

02:16:23.808 --> 02:16:25.744
NOT JUST THE RISING SEASON IT'S

02:16:25.810 --> 02:16:27.212
BEEN EIGHT TO NINE INCHES SINCE

02:16:27.279 --> 02:16:28.647
THE OF THE INDUSTRIAL

02:16:28.713 --> 02:16:30.715
REVOLUTION IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S

02:16:30.782 --> 02:16:32.984
THE EXTREME OF THAT THE EXTREME

02:16:33.051 --> 02:16:34.886
EVENT REALLY DRIVES IT HOME.

02:16:34.953 --> 02:16:37.255
AND THE OTHER PIECE OF IT IS

02:16:37.322 --> 02:16:38.056
THE CALIFORNIA COAST IS VERY

02:16:38.123 --> 02:16:42.093
DIFFERENT. SO IN THAT TSUNAMI-

02:16:42.160 --> 02:16:43.662
THERE WERE TWO PORTS THAT

02:16:43.728 --> 02:16:45.597
REALLY TOOK A MAJOR HIT

02:16:45.664 --> 02:16:46.565
CRESCENT CITY IN DEL NORTE

02:16:46.631 --> 02:16:50.769
COUNTY. AND SANTA CRUZ IN MY

02:16:50.835 --> 02:16:53.104
HOME CITY. AND TWO COMPLETELY

02:16:53.171 --> 02:16:54.739
DIFFERENT AREAS AND SO WHEN

02:16:54.806 --> 02:16:55.540
YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS SEA

02:16:55.607 --> 02:16:58.076
LEVEL RISE YOU HAVE SOME AREAS

02:16:58.143 --> 02:17:00.211
LIKE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLINS

02:17:00.278 --> 02:17:03.982
DISTRICT WHERE. IN PACIFICA

02:17:04.049 --> 02:17:05.350
APARTMENT BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN

02:17:05.417 --> 02:17:06.918
FALLING INTO THE SEA BECAUSE OF

02:17:06.985 --> 02:17:08.820
SANDY SOILS AND OTHER DISTRICTS

02:17:08.887 --> 02:17:10.789
THAT THAT SOME OF US REPRESENT

02:17:10.855 --> 02:17:12.190
THAT HAVE ROCKY PROMONTORY

02:17:12.257 --> 02:17:14.192
SORRY OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY

02:17:14.259 --> 02:17:17.329
WHICH HAS MARSHES AND PRESENTS

02:17:17.395 --> 02:17:19.297
HOLD DIFFERENT ISSUES. AND SO

02:17:19.364 --> 02:17:22.267
THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU

02:17:22.334 --> 02:17:24.703
ADDRESS IT AND THIS BILL IS THE

02:17:24.769 --> 02:17:27.672
NEXT STEP IN THAT CONTINUE ON.

02:17:27.739 --> 02:17:29.374
BECAUSE SB ONE ESTABLISHES FOR

02:17:29.441 --> 02:17:30.575
THE FIRST TIME IN CALIFORNIA

02:17:30.642 --> 02:17:32.477

REQUIREMENTS TO ADDRESS THE

02:17:36.581 --> 02:17:37.983
IMPACT OF SEA LEVEL RISE.

02:17:38.049 --> 02:17:39.884
REQUIRES THE COASTAL COMMISSION

02:17:39.951 --> 02:17:41.353
TO ADOPT AND PERIODICALLY

02:17:41.419 --> 02:17:43.755
UPDATE STANDARDS TO USE AND

02:17:43.822 --> 02:17:45.690
LOCAL AND REGIONAL COASTAL

02:17:45.757 --> 02:17:47.993
PLANNING IN ORDER TO. IDENTIFY

02:17:48.059 --> 02:17:49.794
ASSESS AND MITIGATE C. LEVEL

02:17:49.861 --> 02:17:51.896
RISE. IT ESTABLISHES A NEW

02:17:51.963 --> 02:17:53.632
CROSS GOVERNMENT COLLABORATIVE

02:17:53.698 --> 02:17:55.200
WITHIN THE OCEAN PROTECTION

02:17:55.266 --> 02:17:57.502
COUNCIL. TO ENSURE THE IMPACTS

02:17:57.569 --> 02:17:58.837
OF SEA LEVEL RISE ARE

02:17:58.903 --> 02:18:00.672
ANTICIPATED IN A DRESS BEYOND

02:18:00.739 --> 02:18:01.439
SIMPLY ENVIRONMENTAL

02:18:01.506 --> 02:18:03.541
DEPARTMENTS BUT ALSO BY OUR

02:18:03.608 --> 02:18:05.343
TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE

02:18:05.410 --> 02:18:08.446
AGENCIES. AND FINALLY IT

02:18:08.513 --> 02:18:09.748
ESTABLISHES NEW FUNDING.

02:18:09.814 --> 02:18:12.117
CONTINGENT UPON APPROPRIATION

02:18:12.183 --> 02:18:13.918
IN THE ANNUAL BUDGET FOR STATE

02:18:13.985 --> 02:18:15.887
REGIONAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

02:18:15.954 --> 02:18:18.223
TO PLAN. FOR AND MITIGATE SEA

02:18:18.289 --> 02:18:20.358
LEVEL RISE BUT SEPARATELY IT

02:18:20.425 --> 02:18:22.661
EXPANDS THE EXISTING-

02:18:22.727 --> 02:18:24.295
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

02:18:24.362 --> 02:18:25.730
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GRANT

02:18:25.797 --> 02:18:27.032
PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT

02:18:27.098 --> 02:18:29.034
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES MOST

02:18:29.100 --> 02:18:30.869
IMPACTED FROM SEA LEVEL RISE.

02:18:30.935 --> 02:18:32.470
HAVE A VOICE IN ACTIONS THAT

02:18:32.537 --> 02:18:34.172
THE GOVERNMENT TAKES TO ADDRESS

02:18:34.239 --> 02:18:39.277
THE CHALLENGE. AND SO- IT'S

02:18:39.344 --> 02:18:41.813
TEMPTING TO SEE SEA LEVEL RISE

02:18:41.880 --> 02:18:43.581
IS JUST ANOTHER ENVIRONMENTAL

02:18:43.648 --> 02:18:45.750
ISSUE BUT IN REALITY IT CUTS

02:18:45.817 --> 02:18:47.185
ACROSS MANY AREAS FROM

02:18:47.252 --> 02:18:49.721
TRANSPORTATION THE COMMERCE AND

02:18:49.788 --> 02:18:52.090

02:39:26.857 --> 02:39:29.726
TRYING TO ADDRESS- THIS THIS IS

02:39:29.793 --> 02:39:33.530
THE UNDERLYING BILL- EARLY ON-

02:39:33.597 --> 02:39:34.998
BECAUSE OF THE IMPLEMENTATION

02:39:35.065 --> 02:39:38.335
OF IT AND ITS EFFECT ON CITIES-

02:39:38.402 --> 02:39:40.604

SUPPORT WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE

02:39:53.951 --> 02:39:56.153
BUT IT ALSO FALLS WOEFULLY

02:39:56.219 --> 02:39:58.055
SHORT OF ADDRESSING THESE

02:39:58.121 --> 02:39:59.323
ISSUES THAT THIRTEEN EIGHTY

02:39:59.389 --> 02:40:01.658

02:40:04.328 --> 02:40:07.064
WITH PROCARE THAT PROCUREMENT.

02:40:07.130 --> 02:40:09.733
OF THE ORGANIC MATERIAL- THAT

02:40:09.800 --> 02:40:12.235
HAVE. HAVE YET TO BE EVEN

02:40:12.302 --> 02:40:14.838
DISCUSSED. AND ALSO THE

02:40:14.905 --> 02:40:16.740
MANDATORY COLLECTION- FOR

02:40:16.807 --> 02:40:18.508
REMOTE LOOK AT JURISDICTIONS OR

02:40:18.575 --> 02:40:20.010
CITIES THAT. ARE OUT IN THE

02:40:20.077 --> 02:40:21.678
MIDDLE OF NOWHERE- THE LIFE

02:40:21.745 --> 02:40:23.914
BEING ONE OF THOSE CITIES. FOR

02:40:23.981 --> 02:40:25.415
THEM TO BE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH

02:40:25.482 --> 02:40:27.284
THE ELEMENTS OF THIS ACTUALLY

02:40:27.351 --> 02:40:29.219
PUSHES THEM INTO AN AREA WHERE

02:40:29.286 --> 02:40:29.820
THERE BEING LESS

02:40:29.886 --> 02:40:32.923
ENVIRONMENTALLY. AND

02:40:32.990 --> 02:40:34.791
RESPONSIBLE THAN IF THEY WERE

02:40:34.858 --> 02:40:36.560
TO BE COMPLYING WITH THIS SO

02:40:36.626 --> 02:40:37.527
THOSE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT

02:40:37.594 --> 02:40:39.096
NEED TO BE DONE REPORTING

02:40:39.162 --> 02:40:40.597
TIMELINES ARE TOTALLY

02:40:40.664 --> 02:40:42.966
UNREALISTIC FOR THIS BILL- I

02:40:43.033 --> 02:40:44.101
THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

02:40:44.167 --> 02:40:45.635
THINK WE'VE LEARNED A LESSON

02:40:45.702 --> 02:40:46.703
AND ONE OF THE BILLS WERE GONNA

02:40:46.770 --> 02:40:48.472
HERE IN A LITTLE BIT. WHICH IS

02:40:48.538 --> 02:40:50.307
SB FIVE NINETY SIX THE PERFECT

02:40:50.374 --> 02:40:54.878
EXAMPLE. OF ENGAGING THE-

02:40:54.945 --> 02:40:56.646
INDUSTRIES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN

02:40:56.713 --> 02:41:00.350
TRYING TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN-

02:41:00.417 --> 02:41:03.253
EARLY ON IN OFTEN- TO GET THEIR

02:41:03.320 --> 02:41:04.454
INPUT ON WHAT WORKS AND WHAT

02:41:04.521 --> 02:41:06.123
DOESN'T. BECAUSE ULTIMATELY

02:41:06.189 --> 02:41:07.524
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THIS

02:41:07.591 --> 02:41:12.195
PROGRAM WORKS. AND AND SO I

02:41:12.262 --> 02:41:14.097
THINK- THERE'S A LESSON TO BE

02:41:14.164 --> 02:41:16.433
LEARNED THERE. AND I HOPE THAT

02:41:16.500 --> 02:41:18.068
WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS

02:41:18.135 --> 02:41:20.504
PROBLEM BECAUSE- WE CAN DELAY

IT HAS MORPHED IN A COUPLE OF

02:43:20.824 --> 02:43:22.692
WAYS ONE IS TO DEAL JUST WITH

02:43:22.759 --> 02:43:24.528
THE PENALTIES SO THAT CITIES

02:43:24.594 --> 02:43:26.563

02:43:50.554 --> 02:43:53.590
DOWN THE LINE. AND THERE MAY

02:43:53.657 --> 02:43:55.225
EVEN BE A NEED TO DO SOMETHING

02:43:55.292 --> 02:43:57.894

IMPORTANT GOAL. I HAD A

02:57:01.010 --> 02:57:03.379
QUESTION. V. COMMITTEE AND ALSO

02:57:03.446 --> 02:57:05.314
IT'S ALSO TALKS ABOUT HOW.

02:57:05.381 --> 02:57:07.216
THERE WAS A- TWENTY NINETEEN

02:57:07.283 --> 02:57:08.284
REPORT CALIFORNIA CEMENT

02:57:08.351 --> 02:57:10.019
INDUSTRY FAILING TO FAILING THE

02:57:10.086 --> 02:57:12.221
CLIMATE CHALLENGE. WORD

02:57:12.288 --> 02:57:13.990
INDICATED THAT- THE CALIFORNIA

02:57:14.056 --> 02:57:16.425
CEMENT INDUSTRY. HAD THE SECOND

02:57:16.492 --> 02:57:17.793
HIGHEST CO TWO EMISSIONS

02:57:17.860 --> 02:57:19.462
INTENSITY AMONG THE COUNTRIES

02:57:19.528 --> 02:57:22.732
STUDIED. 57% HIGHER THAN THAT

02:57:22.798 --> 02:57:24.800
OF THE CEMENT INDUSTRY IN

02:57:24.867 --> 02:57:27.470
CHINA- DUE IN PART TO A HIGHER

02:57:27.536 --> 02:57:29.739
CLINKER TO CEMENT RACIAL I WAS

02:57:29.805 --> 02:57:32.942
WONDERING WHAT- WHAT CHINA IS

02:57:33.009 --> 02:57:35.077
DOING THAT WE'RE NOT DOING. I

02:57:35.144 --> 02:57:37.113
CAN SPEAK TO. I CAN'T SPEAK TO

02:57:37.179 --> 02:57:40.282
THE RATIO ITSELF- I WOULD SAY

02:57:40.349 --> 02:57:41.751
YOU KNOW THE ENERGY INTENSITY

02:57:41.817 --> 02:57:44.620
COMES FROM TWO PARTS ONE IS THE

02:57:44.687 --> 02:57:46.455
BUT 40% IS JUST BECAUSE VERY

02:57:46.522 --> 02:57:47.423
ENERGY INTENSIVE TO MAKE SO

02:57:47.490 --> 02:57:49.125
WHAT DO WE USE THAT AND I DON'T

02:57:49.191 --> 02:57:50.526
KNOW IF THAT ACTUALLY COUNTS

02:57:50.593 --> 02:57:51.260
FOR CHINA'S USE OF COAL IN MOST

02:57:51.327 --> 02:57:53.929
CASES TO MAKE- THEIR CEMENT.

02:57:53.996 --> 02:57:55.564
AND IT'S 60% IS THE PROCESS

02:57:55.631 --> 02:57:56.065
EMISSIONS SUCH AS THE

02:57:56.132 --> 02:57:57.600
PROSECUTION'S FOR MAKING A

02:57:57.666 --> 02:57:58.501
CEMENT AND THAT'S WHERE THE

02:57:58.567 --> 02:57:59.802
INNOVATION REALLY CAN COME IN

02:57:59.869 --> 02:58:01.771
IF YOU CAPTURE THAT CAN RESTORE

02:58:01.837 --> 02:58:02.838
THAT IN WILL BE ENCOURAGING

02:58:02.905 --> 02:58:06.008
THAT- IN THIS BILL SO- I CAN'T

02:58:06.075 --> 02:58:07.009
COME IN THE STUDY I DON'T KNOW

02:58:07.076 --> 02:58:09.078
IF THE WITNESSES ANY COMMENTS

02:58:09.145 --> 02:58:11.247
ON THAT BUT ICAN'T SAY I THINK

02:58:11.313 --> 02:58:14.817
THIS WILL MAKE US THE LEADER

02:58:14.884 --> 02:58:16.185
AND I'M VERY CONFIDENT THAT.

02:58:16.252 --> 02:58:17.620
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEVEN COMMENT

02:58:17.686 --> 02:58:20.122
ON. WITNESS CERTAINLY. THANK

02:58:20.189 --> 02:58:20.656
YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:58:20.723 --> 02:58:23.526
RESPOND. THAT REPORT THAT WAS

02:58:23.592 --> 02:58:25.494
RELEASED IN TWENTY NINETEEN

02:58:25.561 --> 02:58:26.996
PROVIDED SOME VERY MISLEADING

02:58:27.063 --> 02:58:29.198
INFORMATION AND UNEQUAL

02:58:29.265 --> 02:58:30.599
PERFORMANCE ARE UNABLE

02:58:30.666 --> 02:58:32.301
COMPARISONS TO THE TYPES OF

02:58:32.368 --> 02:58:33.903
CEMENT THAT'S PRODUCED IN CHINA

02:58:33.969 --> 02:58:36.372
VERSUS THE UNITED STATES. WE DO

02:58:36.439 --> 02:58:38.040
THINGS DIFFERENTLY HERE WE

02:58:38.107 --> 02:58:39.508
ALLOW THE CONCRETE PRODUCERS

02:58:39.575 --> 02:58:41.510
THAT BY CEMENT. TO ADD

02:58:41.577 --> 02:58:43.179
ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS TO REDUCE

02:58:43.245 --> 02:58:45.548
CARBON EMISSIONS THAT DOESN'T

02:58:45.614 --> 02:58:46.415
HAPPEN TO CALIFORNIA OR OTHER

02:58:46.482 --> 02:58:48.851
STATES SO IT'S REALLY TWO

02:58:48.918 --> 02:58:50.786
DIFFERENT TYPES OF PRODUCTION.

02:58:50.853 --> 02:58:53.155
SO IT'S AN UNFAIR COMPARISON

02:58:53.222 --> 02:58:57.460
ARE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER

02:58:57.526 --> 02:58:58.928
MEMBERS SAY ARE TOP RIGHT I

02:58:58.994 --> 02:59:00.262
AGREE WITH EVERYTHING EVERYBODY

02:59:00.329 --> 02:59:01.730
HAS SAID ABOUT WORKING TOGETHER

02:59:01.797 --> 02:59:03.399
WITH THE INDUSTRY AND HOW MUCH

02:59:03.466 --> 02:59:05.334
EASIER THAT WITH THAT WORKS-

02:59:05.401 --> 02:59:07.169
AND IT ALSO IS BENEFICIAL TO

02:59:07.236 --> 02:59:09.038
ACTUALLY ACHIEVING SOME OF

02:59:09.105 --> 02:59:09.972
THESE GOALS WHETHER PEOPLE

02:59:10.039 --> 02:59:12.074
AGREE WITH THEM OR NOT- THOSE

02:59:12.141 --> 02:59:14.243
ARE THE GOALS AND- AND SO THE

02:59:14.310 --> 02:59:15.678
DAY I APPLAUD YOU FOR WORKING

02:59:15.744 --> 02:59:18.280
WITH THEM TO DO THAT- YOU KNOW

02:59:18.347 --> 02:59:19.915
ONE OF MY CONCERNS ALSO AND I

02:59:19.982 --> 02:59:21.050
THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD BE

02:59:21.117 --> 02:59:23.319
CONCERNED IS. IS TO AN AND I

02:59:23.385 --> 02:59:24.487
WOULD EXPECT THE CEMENT

02:59:24.553 --> 02:59:26.155
INDUSTRY WILL WILL HAVE A KEEN

02:59:26.222 --> 02:59:27.490
EYE TOWARD JUST AND THAT'S WHY

02:59:27.556 --> 02:59:28.224
IT'S IMPORTANT TO WORK WITH

02:59:28.290 --> 02:59:31.627
THEM IS IN IN OUR EFFORTS TO

02:59:31.694 --> 02:59:33.262
CREATE A MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY

02:59:33.329 --> 02:59:34.930
FRIENDLY CEMENT WE ALSO WANT TO

02:59:34.997 --> 02:59:36.098
MAKE SURE THE BUILDINGS LIKE

02:59:36.165 --> 02:59:38.067
THIS STATE OVERHEAD WHEN WE'RE

02:59:38.134 --> 02:59:39.068
HAVING EARTHQUAKES AND THINGS

02:59:39.135 --> 02:59:42.438
LIKE THAT- YOU SEE THE- THE

02:59:42.505 --> 02:59:44.507
EFFECTS OF SUB STANDARD CEMENT-

02:59:44.573 --> 02:59:46.142
PRODUCTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES

02:59:46.208 --> 02:59:48.210
WHEN THEY DO HAVE- DISASTERS

02:59:48.277 --> 02:59:50.679
THEY ARE MUCH LESS- RESILIENT

02:59:50.746 --> 02:59:53.415
THAN WE ARE. AND AND MUCH MORE

02:59:53.482 --> 02:59:56.185
LETHAL AND SO- AND I THINK THIS

02:59:56.252 --> 02:59:57.953
APPROACH ALLOWS THEM TO HAVE

02:59:58.020 --> 03:00:01.090
THAT INPUT AND BE ABLE TO-

03:00:01.157 --> 03:00:03.859
BALANCE THAT OUT WITHOUT HAVING

03:00:03.926 --> 03:00:06.295
A ONE SIDED APPROACH THAT LATER

03:00:06.362 --> 03:00:07.229
ON WE FIND OUT- WE'VE JUST

03:00:07.296 --> 03:00:09.732
WEAKENED THE INTEGRITY OF THE

03:00:09.798 --> 03:00:13.068
CEMENT PRODUCT AND- BEYOND-

03:00:13.135 --> 03:00:14.770
WHAT IS SAFE FOR OUR OUR

03:00:14.837 --> 03:00:16.372
PUBLICATIONS AT THE END OF THE

03:00:16.438 --> 03:00:17.940
DAY THAT SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC

03:00:18.007 --> 03:00:19.909
IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE SO

03:24:22.383 --> 03:24:24.986
NGUYEN THE LANGUAGE. START

03:24:25.052 --> 03:24:26.454
TALKING ABOUT WELL LET'S SET A

03:24:26.520 --> 03:24:29.423
NEW GOAL. IT'S QUESTIONS COME

03:24:29.490 --> 03:24:31.258
UP WHEN THE LANGUAGE IS A VERY

03:24:31.325 --> 03:24:33.194
SPECIFIC A. AS WE'VE HEARD FROM

03:24:33.260 --> 03:24:35.630
THE OPPOSITION. YOU KNOW WE

03:24:35.696 --> 03:24:37.598
HAVE HYDROGEN FUEL FUTURES

03:24:37.665 --> 03:24:40.401
WE'VE JUST SEEN VEHICLES BREAK

03:24:40.468 --> 03:24:43.537
LAND MILES TRAVELED. FOR

03:24:43.604 --> 03:24:46.641
HYDROGEN CARS. CHAU CLEARLY

03:24:46.707 --> 03:24:48.876
THAT'S A VIABLE OPTION THAT'S

03:24:48.943 --> 03:24:51.245
NOT BEING DISCUSSED ENOUGH

03:24:51.312 --> 03:24:53.114
FRANKLY BUT BY THIS BODY BY OUR

03:24:53.180 --> 03:24:55.216
GOVERNOR IN WE'RE NOT HEARING

03:24:55.282 --> 03:24:57.118
ENOUGH ABOUT IT EVEN THOUGH WE

03:24:57.184 --> 03:25:01.022
CLAIM TO LEAD THE WAY- WE DON'T

03:25:01.088 --> 03:25:02.990
HEAR ENOUGH ABOUT. RENEWAL

03:25:03.057 --> 03:25:05.826
RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS THAT THEY

03:25:05.893 --> 03:25:07.828
WERE GETTING FROM HARVESTING-

03:25:07.895 --> 03:25:09.497
METHANE FROM DERRY DIED

03:25:09.563 --> 03:25:11.966
GESTURES. IN WHAT THAT CAN DO

03:25:12.033 --> 03:25:14.168
FOR LOCAL AND MEDIUM FLEETS IN

03:25:14.235 --> 03:25:16.303
THAT SPACE AND HOW THAT CAN

03:25:16.370 --> 03:25:18.339
REMOVE A LOT OF THE GREENHOUSE

03:25:18.406 --> 03:25:20.608
GASES FROM R. OR MEDIUM SIZED

03:25:20.675 --> 03:25:23.344
IN AND LOCAL FLEAS. IN REMOVED

03:25:23.411 --> 03:25:26.781
THE DIESEL IN THAT PART. CHAU

03:25:26.847 --> 03:25:28.916
WELL WHEN I SEE LANGUAGE THAT

03:25:28.983 --> 03:25:31.886
THAT FINE TUNES SOMETHING IN

03:25:31.952 --> 03:25:32.887
THIS SPACE AND A LOT OF MY

03:25:32.953 --> 03:25:34.588
COLLEAGUES WE WE'VE ALL WORKED

03:25:34.655 --> 03:25:36.424
VERY HARD ON THIS SOME OF US

03:25:36.490 --> 03:25:39.593
HAVE GONE OUT OF OUR WAY-

03:25:39.660 --> 03:25:40.594
BERMAN OF ENERGY HAS A

03:25:40.661 --> 03:25:42.196
FANTASTIC SCHOOL FOR

03:25:42.263 --> 03:25:44.165
LEGISLATORS IT'S- THE

03:25:44.231 --> 03:25:45.933
LEGISLATIVE ENERGY HORIZON IS

03:25:46.000 --> 03:25:47.168
TO DO THE REALLY DIES OF THE

03:25:47.234 --> 03:25:49.270
NUTS AND BOLTS AND THE POLICY

03:25:49.336 --> 03:25:52.173
ON THIS- SADLY THERE'S ONLY TWO

03:25:52.239 --> 03:25:54.208
PEOPLE. IN THE HUNDRED TWENTY

03:25:54.275 --> 03:25:55.543
OF US THE THAT I'VE ACTUALLY

03:25:55.609 --> 03:25:57.712
GRADUATED FROM THAT SCHOOL THIS

03:25:57.778 --> 03:25:59.947
MYSELF A LOT OF BURKE. AND WE

03:26:00.014 --> 03:26:01.615
LEARN THE FIVE NIGHTS ON THIS

03:26:01.682 --> 03:26:02.750
IS WHY WE WORK SO HARD ON THE

03:26:02.817 --> 03:26:03.751
CAP AND TRADE BILL THAT'S WHY

03:26:03.818 --> 03:26:06.320
WE STILL PUSH. TO ENSURE THERE

03:26:06.387 --> 03:26:09.990
IS THIS DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO.

03:26:10.057 --> 03:26:11.892
EIGHT IN. MY QUESTION FOR YOU

03:26:11.959 --> 03:26:13.728
CENTERS WHY THAT ISN'T SPELLED

03:26:13.794 --> 03:26:15.162
OUT HOW COME YOU HAVEN'T

03:26:15.229 --> 03:26:17.798
SPELLED OUT. YOU SAY YOU WANT

03:26:17.865 --> 03:26:19.400
TO MAKE SURE THIS IS THIS IS

03:26:19.467 --> 03:26:20.968
DIVERSIFIED THAT WE'RE GONNA

03:26:21.035 --> 03:26:22.236
INCLUDE HYDROGEN THAT WE'RE

03:26:22.303 --> 03:26:24.472
GOING TO INCLUDE OTHER. ZERO

03:26:24.538 --> 03:26:27.041
EMISSION FUELS. BUT IT'S NOT

03:26:27.108 --> 03:26:28.242
SPECIFIED IN YOUR BILL SO WHY

03:26:28.309 --> 03:26:30.745
IS THAT. THANK YOU FOR THE

03:26:30.811 --> 03:26:33.214
QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER- AND

03:26:33.280 --> 03:26:34.815
JUST FOR THE RECORD I'M A PORT

03:26:34.882 --> 03:26:36.851
SENATOR SO I REPRESENT ONE OF

03:26:36.917 --> 03:26:37.451
THE LARGEST PORTS IN THE STATE

03:26:37.518 --> 03:26:38.786
OF CALIFONIA. BEEN

03:26:38.853 --> 03:26:39.720
REPRESENTING THEM FOR OVER A

03:26:39.787 --> 03:26:42.156
DECADE WELL AWARE OF THE

03:26:42.223 --> 03:26:44.125
TECHNOLOGY DIVERSITY THAT WE

03:26:44.191 --> 03:26:45.860
WANT TO KEEP AND THIS BILL

03:26:45.926 --> 03:26:47.495
BASICALLY STATES THAT IT IS

03:26:47.561 --> 03:26:49.430
TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL. THAT

03:26:49.497 --> 03:26:51.799
STRATEGY THAT- THE OPPOSITION

03:26:51.866 --> 03:26:53.367
WAS SAYING THAT IS TO THE

03:26:53.434 --> 03:26:56.370
FOCUSED. WE ACTUALLY INCLUDED.

03:26:56.437 --> 03:26:58.405
A LANGUAGE THAT INCLUDES NEAR

03:26:58.472 --> 03:27:00.641
ZERO TECHNOLOGY AS ONE OF THE

03:27:00.708 --> 03:27:02.676
STRATEGIES THAT SHOULD BE S. AS

03:27:02.743 --> 03:27:04.211
IN THE TRANSPORTATION STRATEGY

03:27:04.278 --> 03:27:05.045
THIS IS SUSTAINABLE

03:27:05.112 --> 03:27:06.747
TRANSPORTATION STRATEGY SO IT'S

03:27:06.814 --> 03:27:09.316
TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL. AND THEN WE

03:27:09.383 --> 03:27:11.619
ALSO INCLUDED AMENDMENTS IN

03:27:11.685 --> 03:27:14.955
SENATE Q. R. THAT INCLUDED A

03:27:15.022 --> 03:27:16.490
SPECIFIED THAT THEIR THEIR

03:27:16.557 --> 03:27:18.159
RECENT SPORT RESOURCES BOARD

03:27:18.225 --> 03:27:19.360
SHALL CONSIDER INCLUDING

03:27:19.426 --> 03:27:21.595
EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS GOALS

03:27:21.662 --> 03:27:23.164
THAT'S NOT A REQUIREMENT. WELL

03:27:23.230 --> 03:27:24.064
THAT IS OF THE DRESS THE

03:27:24.131 --> 03:27:25.766
OPPOSITION CENTER THAT THAT'S

03:27:25.833 --> 03:27:28.135
FANTASTIC WE DID THE POINT IS

03:27:28.202 --> 03:27:28.769
YOU STILL HAVE CLEAR

03:27:28.836 --> 03:27:32.907
OPPOSITION. FROM INDUSTRIES IN

03:27:32.973 --> 03:27:35.709
THE RENEWABLE SPACE. SO THAT

03:27:35.776 --> 03:27:37.011
TELLS US THAT THERE'S MORE WORK

03:27:37.077 --> 03:27:38.579
THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND MORE

03:27:38.646 --> 03:27:39.814
AMENDMENTS THE NEED TO GET DONE

03:27:39.880 --> 03:27:43.083
ON THIS. AND BEING THAT YOU DO

03:27:43.150 --> 03:27:44.518
REPRESENT THE PARTS I'M SURE

03:27:44.585 --> 03:27:46.120
YOU'RE AWARE THAT THE PORTS ARE

03:27:46.187 --> 03:27:48.189
FRANKLY TERRIFIED THAT THEY'RE

03:27:48.255 --> 03:27:48.756
GONNA HAVE A BILLION DOLLARS

03:27:48.823 --> 03:27:50.891
COST. AND HAVING TO GO TO A

03:27:50.958 --> 03:27:54.261
LECTURE FOR CATION- NGUYEN. IF

03:27:54.328 --> 03:27:56.030
WE DO A BETTER JOB AT THE

03:27:56.096 --> 03:27:57.932
LANGUAGE WE'RE PUTTING INTO OUR

03:27:57.998 --> 03:28:00.467
LEGISLATION. WE CAN SHOW THEM

03:28:00.534 --> 03:28:01.969
THAT YOU KNOW YES YOU CAN DO

03:28:02.036 --> 03:28:03.737
SOME ELECTRIC HERE. YOU CAN DO

03:28:03.804 --> 03:28:05.639
SOME HYDROGEN FUEL STUFF HERE.

03:28:05.706 --> 03:28:08.843
IF YOU'RE IN ONE MORE IN. DO

03:28:08.909 --> 03:28:09.710
YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO THE

03:28:09.777 --> 03:28:11.712
RENEWABLE. NATURAL GAS SITE

03:28:11.779 --> 03:28:15.749
HERE. SO IT IS VERY IMPERATIVE.

03:28:15.816 --> 03:28:17.751
THAT WE GET THESE THINGS RIGHT.

03:28:17.818 --> 03:28:20.387
BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO THESE

03:28:20.454 --> 03:28:21.922
THE DETAILS MATTER. INSULA

03:28:21.989 --> 03:28:24.692
INTEL I SEE THAT FINE I'D

03:28:24.758 --> 03:28:25.159
LANGUAGE AND SEE THIS

03:28:25.226 --> 03:28:28.395
OPPOSITION- THE THAT ANOTHER

03:28:28.462 --> 03:28:30.464
RENEWABLE FUEL SOURCE THAT THE

03:28:30.531 --> 03:28:31.198
FRANKLY IS ACTUALLY MORE

03:28:31.265 --> 03:28:34.568
VIABLE- THEN GOING STRAIGHT

03:28:34.635 --> 03:28:37.605
ELECTRIC VEHICLE- THE INTEL I

03:28:37.671 --> 03:28:38.772
SEE THAT I'M GONNA STAY OFF

03:28:38.839 --> 03:28:40.174
YOUR BILL. IN IN IF YOU'D LIKE

03:28:40.241 --> 03:28:41.508
SOME HELP PUTTING THAT TOGETHER

03:28:41.575 --> 03:28:43.110
A MORE THAN HELP HAPPY TO SIT

03:28:43.177 --> 03:28:44.578
DOWN AND TAKE PERSONAL TIME TO

03:28:44.645 --> 03:28:46.947
WORK WITH YOU ON THAT- BECAUSE

03:28:47.014 --> 03:28:47.548
I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

03:28:47.615 --> 03:28:50.084
DO HERE IS IMPORTANT. BUT IT IS

03:28:50.150 --> 03:28:50.618
IMPORTANT THAT WE GET IT

03:28:50.684 --> 03:28:52.519
CORRECT. YEAH AND WE ARE

03:28:52.586 --> 03:28:53.954
WORKING TOWARDS THAT SO THIS IS

03:28:54.021 --> 03:28:55.456
AGAIN VERY TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL

03:28:55.522 --> 03:28:57.858
AND I WOULD JUST. RESPECTFULLY

03:28:57.925 --> 03:28:58.525

03:29:13.807 --> 03:29:16.110
BELL- BUT I DID HAVE SOME

03:29:16.176 --> 03:29:18.545
QUESTIONS AS SIMILAR TO A

03:29:18.612 --> 03:29:20.514
MISTER MATHIS I REMEMBER. WHEN

03:29:20.581 --> 03:29:23.250
I WAS INVITED VIçT TO THE

03:29:23.317 --> 03:29:26.387
PORT OF LONG BEACH- WHERE-

03:29:26.453 --> 03:29:28.722
TOYOTA AND MARY NICHOLS ROLLED

03:29:28.789 --> 03:29:32.826
OUT- MODEL- HYDROGEN FUEL CELL

03:29:32.893 --> 03:29:35.162
HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS AS PART OF

03:29:35.229 --> 03:29:38.899
THE SOLUTION TO REALLY CLEAN UP

03:29:38.966 --> 03:29:40.534
THE AIR QUALITY AND- NO IN IN

03:29:40.601 --> 03:29:41.835
SOME OF THE HARDER NO THE MOST

03:29:41.902 --> 03:29:45.172
IMPACTED TO. MOST PUT- POLLUTED

03:29:45.239 --> 03:29:47.041
COMMUNITIES- IN IN YOUR

03:29:47.107 --> 03:29:51.278
DISTRICT- AND SO I WAS JUST I

03:29:51.345 --> 03:29:53.314
DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS A I

03:29:53.380 --> 03:29:55.416
DON'T REALLY. UNDERSTAND WHY

03:29:55.482 --> 03:29:57.584
THE- CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN

03:29:57.651 --> 03:29:59.620
COALITION IS IN OPPOSITION BUT

03:29:59.687 --> 03:30:01.822
I WOULD THINK THAT- THAT

03:30:01.889 --> 03:30:03.991
HYDROGEN THANK YOU HAVE A GREAT

03:30:04.058 --> 03:30:05.225
DAY FOR THE QUESTION AND I

03:30:05.292 --> 03:30:07.728
COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND- YOU KNOW

03:30:07.795 --> 03:30:11.365
EVERYONE'S- I GUESS. QUESTIONS

03:30:11.432 --> 03:30:12.967
ABOUT WHY IT'S NOT EXPLICITLY

03:30:13.033 --> 03:30:15.836
pTECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL WE WANT TO

03:30:15.903 --> 03:30:17.237
BE ABLE TO SAY IF THERE ARE

03:30:17.304 --> 03:30:18.639
OTHER TECHNOLOGIES ASIDE FROM

03:30:18.706 --> 03:30:20.674
JUST ELECTRIC THAT WE CAN DO

03:30:20.741 --> 03:30:21.942
SOMETHING IN THE AND IN THE

03:30:22.009 --> 03:30:23.344
INTERMEDIATE FOR WE ARE LOOKING

03:30:23.410 --> 03:30:24.878
AT HYDROGEN FUEL CELL RENEWABLE

03:30:24.945 --> 03:30:26.313
NATURAL GAS WITH HAPPY. THIS IS

03:30:26.380 --> 03:30:28.182
OPEN TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT

03:30:28.248 --> 03:30:29.917
OKAY- WE ACTUALLY HAVE HYDROGEN

03:30:29.984 --> 03:30:31.352
USERS THAT ARE IN OUR SUPPORT

03:30:31.418 --> 03:30:33.187
SUPPORT COALITION AS WELL SO

03:30:33.253 --> 03:30:33.954
YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT

03:30:34.021 --> 03:30:35.389
EVERYTHING HAVING DIESEL RIGHT

03:30:35.456 --> 03:30:36.323
NOW ON THIS ON THE ROADS IT'S

03:30:36.390 --> 03:30:38.192
JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE AND SO I

03:30:38.258 --> 03:30:40.694
THINK- TO MR GAVIN'S POINT AND

03:30:40.761 --> 03:30:42.529
TO- IS ALEXANDER'S POINT YOU

03:30:42.596 --> 03:30:43.230
KNOW WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT

03:30:43.297 --> 03:30:45.799
WERE OPEN- BUT WE NEED TO START

03:30:45.866 --> 03:30:48.302
MAKING THESE CHANGES. RIGHT

03:30:48.369 --> 03:30:49.770
AWAY SO CAN'T. YOU KNOW WICKS

03:30:49.837 --> 03:30:52.539
OF. IRAQ HELLO THANK YOU I LOOK

03:30:52.606 --> 03:30:54.975
FOR TO- THAT CLARIFICATION.

03:30:55.042 --> 03:30:56.844
ANOTHER POINT THAT WAS. RAISED

03:30:56.910 --> 03:30:59.747
IN THE- COMMITTEE ANALYSIS SO.

03:30:59.813 --> 03:31:01.849
YOU KNOW. UNDER THE HEADING OF

03:31:01.915 --> 03:31:02.850
THE QUESTION MARK ERROR

03:31:02.916 --> 03:31:04.785
DISTRICTS GIVEN SHORT SHRIFT IN

03:31:04.852 --> 03:31:07.821
THE STRATEGY. THAT YOU KNOW-

03:31:07.888 --> 03:31:09.323
MAKING THE POINT THAT THE OUR

03:31:09.390 --> 03:31:10.624
LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS LIKE THE

03:31:10.691 --> 03:31:12.326
SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY

03:31:12.393 --> 03:31:14.561
MANAGEMENT DISTRICT. YOU KNOW

03:31:14.628 --> 03:31:17.398
WE WHICH IS MUCH MORE- PLAYS A

03:31:17.464 --> 03:31:19.233
MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN

03:31:19.299 --> 03:31:20.501
THE CAR MORE IT MORE YOUR

03:31:20.567 --> 03:31:22.302
ANOTHER- CLEAN VEHICLE

03:31:22.369 --> 03:31:24.872
PROGRAMS- IT IS THE IS THE

03:31:24.938 --> 03:31:28.242
INTENTTO GIVE IT TO. LESS OF A-

03:31:28.308 --> 03:31:29.710
OF A ROLE AS A CONSUL

03:31:29.777 --> 03:31:31.178
CONSULTATION ROLE RATHER THAN A

03:31:31.245 --> 03:31:33.147
COORDINATION ROLE. THAT WASN'T

03:31:33.213 --> 03:31:34.848
THE INTENT AT ALL AND SO I'M

03:31:34.915 --> 03:31:35.582
GLAD THAT THE COMMITTEE

03:31:35.649 --> 03:31:37.051
