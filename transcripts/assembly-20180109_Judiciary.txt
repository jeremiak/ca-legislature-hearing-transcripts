SOME OF THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE WITH RESPECT TO AGENCY WHILE NOT INTENDING TO BE CONTROVERSIAL.

THE BILL WITH THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS CONTINUES TO RESOLVE MATTERS OF IMPORTANCE TO THE CONSUMERS AND PRACTITIONERS IN THIS AREA. IT CONSOLIDATES TERMS SO THAT USAGE IS MORE UNDERSTANDABLE SUCH AS. REPLACING TRANSFER WITH SELLER. IT REMOVES ARCHAIC TERMS REPLACING THE CONFUSING TERM SELLING AGENT BY BUYER'S AGENT FOR AN AGENT OF THE BUYER.

AUTHOR BUT ALSO. FEW MEMBERS WE NEED TO COLLECT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE OUR SECOND AUTHOR. THANK YOU SO WE MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER TWO AB TEN FIFTY NINE. GONZALEZ LETTER. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AB TEN FIFTY NINE A SIMPLY IMPROVE THE DISCLOSURE WHEN OF REAL ESTATE BROKER OR AGENT REPRESENTS BOTH SIDES OF THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION KNOWN AS DUAL AGENCY. THIS ARRANGEMENT IT'S BECOME COMMONPLACE IN REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS AND CAN LACK THE CHECKS AND BALANCES THAT OCCUR WHEN A SELLER BUYER. OR LESSER IN MY SEAT EACH HAVE THEIR OWN REPRESENTATION DURING A TRANSACTION. CURRENTLY THERE'S A LONG AND CONFUSING DISCLOSURE THAT SUGGEST THAT DOLE AGENTS HAVE FIDUCIARYRESPONSIBILITY BOTH THE BUYER AND THE SELLER. IT'S A VERY SMALL FONT AND AS YOU CAN SEE I HAVE A COPY IF I CAN SHOW YOU. OF THIS IS. THE COMPLETE DISCLOSURE TO TELL SOMEBODY THAT THEY OR THEIR AGENT IS ACTUALLY REPRESENTING. BOTH SIDES OF THE TRANSACTION FOR THOSE OF YOU HER ATTORNEYS COMMITMENT IF THAT'S ALL YOU'RE GETTING I'M. HOW CLEAR THAT IT'S IT'S ALSO BEGIN GET IT THERE'S A LOT FLEXIBILITY IN WHEN IT CAN BE GIVEN AND SO IT'S BEEN GIVEN AT A TIME WHEN A NUMBER OTHER DISCLOSURES OFTEN ARE GIVEN AND NOT GIVEN THE PROPER WEIGHT PROBABLY TO ENSURE? THAT THE TENANT AS WELL THE LANDLORD HAS BEEN ADEQUATELY REPRESENTED UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL FOR CONFLICT OF INTEREST. WHAT THIS WOULD DO IS SIMPLIFY THIS FORM? IT WOULD BE AND FOURTEEN POINT POT IT SIMPLY. DECLARE THAT THAT THE THE AGENTS THE LESSEE IS REPRESENTING BOTH SIDES OF THE DEAL SO THAT THE TENANT ESPECIALLY TENANTS WERE SMALL BUSINESSES ARE STOREFRONT OPERATIONS CAN BE CLEAR THAT THEY'RE BEING REPRESENTED BOTH BY THE PERSON REPRESENTING THE LANDLORD. AND THE TENANT IT WOULD ALSO HAVE TO BE GIVEN AT A TIME WHEN THE TRANSACTION STARTS NOT JUST WHEN THE REST OF THE DISCLOSURES ARE GIVEN. I THINK THIS IS SIMPLE IT'S CLEAR IT'S THAT IT'S JUST TO ENSURE THE PEOPLE ARE ADEQUATELY I'M. ENSURE THAT THEY KNOW WHAT IS MOVING FORWARD AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR HIGH BUT I THINK I HAVE SOME. FOLKS WHO ARE GOING TO TESTIFY. THANK YOU ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. I DON'T. SEEING NONE NO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ALRIGHT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MATTHEW HARD WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS PROPERTIES ASSOCIATION WE FIRST WANT TO START OUT BY THANKING THE AUTHOR WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT HOW FAR THIS BILL IS COME. AND WE SPENT MUCH TIME OVER THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS AND THE NEW YEAR'S HOLIDAYS WORKING WITH YOUR STAFF AND OTHER FOLKS ON THIS BILL. AT THE LANGUAGE THAT YOU SEE BEFORE YOU NOW IS A GREAT IMPROVEMENT IN OUR OPINION THAT WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH AUTHOR ON. FIXING SOME OF IT OUR MAIN CONCERN WITH THE BILL AT THIS POINT IS IT'S REQUIRING A THIRD DISCLOSURE WHICH WE FEEL IS AND. MORE THAN IT IS NECESSARY FOR FOLKS UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'RE IN A DUAL AGENCY SITUATION. AND AS WE AND WE HAVE A GREAT CONCERN ABOUT WHEN THAT GETS TRIGGERED. WE THINK AS A LANGUAGE IS WRITTEN RIGHT NOW IT POTENTIALLY HOUSE A GOTCHA IN TO GET IT POTENTIALLY GETS. ASSN AGENTS IN TROUBLE BECAUSE. YOU DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHEN THAT THIRD DISCLOSURE SUPPOSE TO HAPPEN SO WITH THAT AGAIN WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AS WE MOVE FORWARD. AT BUT AT THIS POINT COMPANY BITS PROPERTY ASSOCIATION IS IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. THAT MORNING ONE SECOND IF YOU WOULD MEAN WE DO HAVE A QUORUM OF LIKE TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM. STONE. HERE CUNNINGHAM CHAO. CHIU GARCIA. HOLDEN KALRA. KILEY THEIR. MAINTAIN. PRESS. WE DO HAVE A QUORUM AND I WILL NOTE FOR THE RECORD THAT ITEM NUMBER ONE AB TEN FIFTY SIX MISTER KYLIE'S BEEN PULLED FROM THE CALENDAR. AND ITEM NUMBER FOUR AB FIFTEEN THIRTY ONE MISTER BERMAN IS OUR PROPOSED CONSENT ITEM. ALRIGHT NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING TARA MEMBERS MY NAME IS CHRISTINE DUGGAR ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS WE ALSO WOULD LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF FOR WORKING SO CLOSELY WITH A FROM THE SPELL. AND WE NEED TO REMAIN IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AS IT STANDS NOW. CURRENTLY WE HAVE TO UP REAL ESTATE LAW CLEAN UP BILLS THAT ARE GOING TO THE PROCESS ONE OF WHICH THIS COMMITTEE JUST HEARD. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO BY THE AUTHOR TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ONGOING STAKEHOLDER DISCUSSIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING WE THINK DISCLOSURE WOULD BE A VERY RELEVANT PART OF THAT CLEANUP. BUT AS IT STANDS NOW AND THE BILL REALLY CREATES A DUPLICATIVE REQUIREMENT I'M WERE NOT SURE THAT IT ACTUALLY WILL OCCUR AT ANYTIME SOONER IN THE TRANSACTION SO IT MAY NOT ACHIEVE WHAT IT'S ATTEMPTING TO ACHIEVE. DISCLOSURES AS THEY STAND NOW ON AGENCY ARE REQUIRED TO BE PRESENTED TO THE BUYER. OR THE LAW LASSIE UP PRIOR TO AN OFFER BEING MADE. THEY SPELL IT WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO BE MADE AT SOME POINT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER LICENSE ACTIVITY BEGAN. IS THAT AGENCY IS THAT A YOU UNPLUG WHAT RELATIONSHIP IS THAT I'M WERE JUST UNCLEAR WE DON'T THINK THE BILL'S FULLY COOKED WE INVITE YOU TO BE A PART OF OUR STAKEHOLDER DISCUSSIONS AND HOPEFULLY INCLUDE THAT AT. YOUR DISCLOSURE CONCERNS IN OUR BILLS WE DO SUPPORT VIC CLEAR AGENCY DISCLOSURE. OUR ORGANIZATION SPONSORED THE ORIGINAL AGENTS LEGISLATION WE JUST DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS IN PROPER FORM. BUT I THINK OUR POST. AND WHAT ELSE IN OPPOSITION. S. COME FORWARD AND GIVE YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE BUT B. ARIAS. ALREADY HAS THE AUTHORITY TO INVESTIGATE IT ART THANK YOU THANK YOU. NEXT IN OPPOSITION IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION CHONG LEWIS OF THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS REPRESENTING TWENTY TWO THOUSAND BUSINESS OWNERS ALSO OPPOSED.

GOOD MORNING STEVE CREATURE NAY UP CALIFORNIA. BARBARA GOT ON BEHALF OF CBRE INTERNATIONAL. IN OPPOSITION. IT WOULD ALSO OPPOSITION. ALRIGHT SEEING NONE. I THINK NOW MY SPONSOR IS HERE IF I COULD THAT I KNOW THAT'S OUT OF ORDER MINDS THEN IT IS OUT OF ORDER BUT OF ALL TAKE TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT SINCE THERE WAS NO TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT IF IT'S BRIEF PLEASE THANK HIM. WHENEVER ONE. MORNING. SO. IN TERMS OF WHAT THIS IS DOING IS RIGHT NOW IT'S. AND JASON USE HIS MARINO. THE DISCLOSURE AS IT CURRENTLY STANDS DOES NOT. WORK VERY WELL FOR LACK OF BETTER WORDS. AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS IN REAL PRACTICE GET THIS OUT THERE FOR THE CONSUMER THAT DOESN'T KNOW BETTER. AND ARE NOT BEING TOLD WHAT THE POTENTIAL. CHALLENGES AND UC CONFLICTS MIGHT BE. SO RIGHT NOW IN PRACTICE IT'S NOT BE DISCLOSED UNTIL. TYPICALLY THE VERY AND WHEN ALL THE DOCUMENTS ARE SIGNED IN ITS TYPICALLY A STACK OF. COULD BE HUNDRED PAID OUT PAGES AND A MULTIPLE SIGNATURES. SO. REALLY THE WHOLE DO AGENCIES SHOULD BE BANNED ALTOGETHER. BARRING THAT AT THE VERY LEAST IT SHOULD BE HAVE BETTER DISCLOSURE WHICH IS ALL WE'RE ASKING FOR THIS POINT. THANK. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SPORTS. ALRIGHT SING NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COME. THINK THINK I'VE GOT ICE I MISSED. THE TESTIMONY. EARLIER AND I JUST CALLED A PIECE AND SO YOU MIGHT BE REPEATING SOMETHING THAT AREA SAID SOMETHING BELCHING FROM. THERE WITH BUT I DID CATCH AND OF A COMMENT ABOUT. I I HAD MISSED THAT PRINTS OUT THE CURRENT DISCLOSURE HARM. A HAVE A COPY AS WELL YEAH AND AND AND I AND I. AND I'M LATE TO DO MY HOMEWORK STYLES WITH RELATING TO THIS CLOSE THAT BUT I WAS READING THAT DISCLOSURE THAT'S IN HERE. IN ADDITION TO WHICH IS. MY QUESTION IS THERE WAS A COMMENT OF. WHETHER IT DIED FAKE THAT AT MINES AND IS CORRECT IT'S TWO PIECE RIGHT NOW IT'S WE MOVE UP DISCLOSURE. A TO TO GUARANTEE THAT A CERTAIN SPOT I'M NOT AGAIN LIKE YOU'RE SAYING. AND WE CHANGE WITH THE LANGUAGE THAT'S BEING FAT. I THINK WE CLARIFIED IF YOU LIKE IT AT AND TO MAKE IT HERE SO THAT. I JUST THOUGHT. SO YEAH YOU GET SIMPLY THAT'S WHEN YOU ENTER INTO THE RELATIONSHIP WITH. THE DILIGENT. WE AT A SO THAT THERE FOR THEM MY MY QUESTION. AND AN I POD IS THAT THE OPPOSITION HAS LEFT. BUT YOU YOU COULD TALK AND IF I CAN MAYBE GET DEPOSITION IS IS THERE DISCUSSIONS OF. WHAT WOULD BE IN IN THE LINE WHICH IS I FEEL THERE'S A LOT WAS PIECE AND THERE'S A TINY PIECE BUT SO WE FOR EVEN TALK ABOUT TIGHTENING ON THE LINE WITH PEACE? SHUT NEGOTIATIONS BEEN HAPPENING ON THAT I. I HEARD AT THE VERY END ABOUT WE WANT TO KEEP WORKING. WITH THE OTHER NUMBER THAT I AM NOT SURE WHAT THAT MEANS IS I MEAN A WHOLE YOU BILL AND SOME TO STRAIN THROUGHOUT THE MEANS FROM YOU AND FROM THEM. SO I APOLOGIZE THEY CAME IN FULLY TO THE DISCUSSION FOR ME. AYE I HAVE AT THIS BILL IN FACT IS A TO YOUR BILL AT A TRUE TO YOUR BILL THIS ISN'T A I GOT A MAN AND WE HAVE. COMPLETELY REDUCE THIS JUST TO DISCLOSURE I'VE HAD TALKS WITH THE OPPOSITION AND MY OFFICE I'M DURING THE BREAK WE HAVE CONTINUED I KNOW THE CHAIR HAS HAS TALKED AT LENGTH. I'M WITH ALL PARTIES ABOUT THIS ISSUE IT'S AN ISSUE THAT'S TIMELY THERE IS I'M. A I NEED TO HEAD TO ACT ON THIS IDEA OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST BECAUSE OF SUPREME COURT YOU KNOW AND SO WE HAVE TO IT WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN. INSURE ODD THAT WE'RE PROTECTING CONSUMERS AND I'LL ALTHOUGH A LOT OF THE EXAMPLES. THERE'S A LITTLE DISCONNECT I'M A LOT EXAMPLES THAT WERE PRESENTED TO ME ARE A BIG LAW FIRM WHOSE RENTING SPACE OF COURSE IN A LARGE BUILDING IN WHICH CASE I'M I'M A LITTLE LESS CONCERNED THAT THEY HAVE TO READ THE DISCLOSURE AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING. WHO I AM? REPRESENT IN MY DISTRICT ARE ARE MUCH SMALLER BUSINESSES OFTEN WITH LANGUAGE BARRIERS TO. DON'T UNDERSTAND QUITE WHAT'S GOING ON EXCEPT THAT THEY'RE WORKING WITH AN AGENT TO FIND LEASABLE SPACE AND AND. AT THE END TO GET THIS ALONG WITH I THINK IT'S AN EIGHT PAGE DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT. ST BAIT THEY'VE BEEN INFORMED THAT THEY THAT THE PERSON WHO IS I'M ACTING AS THEIR THERE ARE AGENT IS ALSO ACTING AS AGENTS OF THE LANDLORD. SO WE WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR AND I AM OPEN OF COURSE I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH AND THEY HAVEN'T SUGGESTED ANY CHANGE IN IN LANGUAGE THEY HAVEN'T SUGGESTED ANY CHANGE IN THIS BILL. AT IT IT'S KIND OF HARD TO WORK WITH A OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED WHEN YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE. THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS BUT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK OBVIOUSLY THIS IS AT A PROCESS THAT IS IN THE FIRST HOUSE AT THE FIRST HEARING TO BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT. SIR. SO IF WE OPPOSITION WHO. IT'S GOING TO COME ANSWER QUESTIONS. THE I'M SORRY ON THE LANGUAGE AND THE ON THE LINE WITH HE'S NOT THE TIMING. AND DURING THE STAKEHOLDER DISCUSSIONS THAT WE'VE HAD THIS FAR WITH COMMITTEE WITH THE AUTHOR STOP AND WE WERE STILL DEALING WITH A BILL THAT WAS IN A FULL BAR DULY AGENCIES. AND SO WE HAVE BEEN MOSTLY NEGOTIATING GETTING IT BACK YOU KNOW. PAIRING THIS DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY WE HAVEN'T YET GOTTEN TO A PLACE WHERE WE HAVE DISCUSSED LANGUAGE WE DO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE CURRENT LANGUAGE AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED. I'M WE THINK THAT IN SOME WAYS IT DEMONIZED AS TO AGENCIES WHEN IT REALLY. IT IN STATUTE WHICH WE THINK IS INAPPROPRIATE UP AND DIDN'T. AND SO AGAIN AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE HAVE TWO BILLS THAT ARE MOVING RIGHT NOW THAT ARE CLEANING UP THE REAL ESTATE LAN BUT THE CIVIL GOOD BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE. AND WE INVITE WITH THIS WOULD BE AN ABSOLUTELY OF THOSE BILLS IN BOTH OF THOSE SPELLS WE WOULD ABSOLUTELY INVITE AND AUTHORED HER STOPPED CONTINUE. ENGAGING IN STAKEHOLDER CONVERSATIONS ON THOSE WE JUST DON'T THINK THAT THIS BILL IS COOKED READY TO GO AND IN ITS CURRENT FORM. WE DON'T THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THAT IT ATTEMPTS TO. BUT THE QUESTION. TO MAKE. THIRTIES GO. NO GARDENS CUNNINGHAM OKAY. THANK YOU I JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS ON THE PENALTY SECTION I THINK IT'S SECTION DE. OF IN THE. AMENDED MARKUP LANGUAGE. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE'S OTHER. OTHER AREAS OF LOS SOMEWHERE IN THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE MAYBE WERE THE BUREAU OF REAL STATE HAS THE AUTHORITY. TO PENALIZE. AGENTS FOR NON COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR ITS REQUIREMENTS AND THIS SEEMS TO ADD A NEW SECTION THAT CALLS FOR. DISCIPLINE INCLUDING. FORFEITURE OF LICENSE AND I. I GUESS I. I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND FOR A WILLFUL VIOLATORS A REPEAT OFFENDER WHY THAT WOULD MAYBE BE APPROPRIATE OR. OF SOMEONE WHO'S GOT A RECORD OF. IT'S SORT OF BLOWING OFF DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS THAT THERE. UNDER THE LAW. BUT I THINK THE BUREAU REAL SAY AYE I MAY BE WRONG BUT I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM ME BOTH SIDES ABOUT WHETHER IT'S ACCURATE I THINK TO BE A REAL REAL SAID ALREADY HAS THE POWER TO DO THAT. AND SO I'M WONDERING IF THE SECTION DE IS. EVERY GUY GETS CONCERT TAKEN OUT OF THE BILL. IT SEEMS LIKE. FORFEITURE OF LICENSE FOR. AN INADVERTENCE NONDISCLOSURE OR A FIRST TIME OFFENSE JUST DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE APPROPRIATE. PENALTY TO MAKE. AND AT SUCH AS THE. ON A THREAT OUT THERE I AGREE AND I THINK PART. ACTUALLY JUST RESTATED WHAT THE POSSIBLE PENALTY WOULD BE SO OKAY WE CAN CROSS REFERENCE IT THAT'S BETTER. SO OKAY SO THE INTENT IS IT'S NOT ADDING THAT DO NOT HAVE EIGHTY NINE IT NOW OBVIOUSLY THAT'S UP TO TO YOU KNOW IN A DEGREE JUST CASE BECAUSE THERE'S. OTHER FACTORS IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR ME TO DECIDE BUT I I AGREE WITH YOU ANNA. IN A CASE IT'S INCIDENTAL THAT'S NOT WHAT WAS INTENDED. OKAY. AND THEN MY OTHER QUESTION WAS JUST. IT THIS IS JUST FOR A COMMERCIAL RIGHT YES. OKAY I. I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT SEEMS LIKE THE PROBLEM WOULD BE MORE ACUTE IN THE ON THE RESIDENTIAL SIDE IN THE COMMERCIAL IS BECAUSE. THE TYPES OF PEOPLE TO GET INTO THOSE TRANSACTIONS I MEAN MAYBE I'M WRONG BUT. JUST CURIOUS WHY WOULDN'T DEFINITELY IS PROBABLY GONNA WILL. FOR THE PROMISE COMMERCIAL YOU'RE DEALING WITH IT INSTITUTION MULTIBILLION DOLLAR INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE REPRESENTED THIS IS THEIR PROFESSION. HEY THERE THEY MIGHT HAVE FOR EXAMPLE CBRE. EITHER OWNS OR CONTROLS TWO POINT FIVE BILLION SQUARE FEET OF COMMERCIAL SPACE THAT'S EQUAL TO EVERY OFFICE BUILDING ON THE WHOLE WESTERN HALF OF THE U. S.. SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF PROPERTY. YOU KNOW A GROUP LIKE THAT IS VERY VERY SOPHISTICATED WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND THEY WORK TOGETHER. TO HELP THEIR CLIENTS THEIR CONSTITUENTS WHICH I LANDLORDS PRIMARILY IT REPRESENT A LOT OF LOT ATTENDANTS TO BUT. A LOT OF THOSE ARE IN DUAL AGENCY CONFLICTED ROLES. WE THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THESE TENANTS WHO CAN BE. A DRY CLEANER OR A DELI OR A COFFEE SHOP ALL THE WAY UP TO THE LARGEST FIRMS OUT THERE. THEY AT LEAST BE AWARE THAT THERE'S THAT POTENTIAL OF CONFLICT. THAT EVERYBODY'S YOU NEED IT ACTING EGREGIOUSLY JUST THERE'S THAT POTENTIAL IN THAT SHOULD JUST BE A LITTLE BIT MORE WHERE. AND SO I AGREE WITH YOUR ASSUMPTION THAT THERE'S PROBABLY. OTHER PROBLEMS WITH A REAL ESTATE AT. AT NIGHT SORRY I DON'T KNOW THE TERM THE PER A PERSONAL REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION. R. HOME BUYERS BAD BUT THIS IS A. AND THAT'S ONE OF THINGS I THINK THEY'RE DEALING WITH IN THESE OMNIBUS BILLS THAT ARE GOING THROUGH NOW THIS WAS JUST DEALING WITH THE SPECIFIC ISSUE WITH SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. IN MY DISTRICT. WHO ARE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE TO LEAST SMALL AMOUNTS OF SPACE FROM YOU KNOW WE WANNA JUST IN SHORT THAT THEY'RE PROTECTED AND? THAT THEY HAVE AS A BASIC DISCLOSURE THAT THEY CAN UNDERSTAND EVEN IF THEIR ENGLISH SKILLS PROBABLY AREN'T. UP TO PAR. OKAY. AND THEN. APPRECIATE THAT. THAT MY LAST QUESTION RELATES TO. I I GUESS WHAT WE'RE GOING FOR WITH THE TIMING AYE IS I READ SECTION SEE. IT SAYS AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE. YOU SHALL PROVIDE THE WRITTEN DISCLOSURE A ONCE THE LICENSEE COMMENCES LICENSE ACTIVITY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WHAT THAT MEANS BUT THAT MIGHT BE. ME NOT KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT REAL STATUS BUT WHAT WHAT IS THE IDEA FOR WHEN THIS SEEMS LIKE YOU WANT THE DISCLOSURE OF THAT IF. YOU WANT TO BE AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE AND IT JUST. DONE ONCE AND RIGHT IS SORT OF. MY VIEW OF. HOW YOU WOULD OPERATE EFFICIENTLY AND THAT IS THAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS THAT THE EARLY IN ONCE OR IS IT? LIKE A DUPLICATE OF THING THAT'S GOING TO BE DONE AT VARIOUS. TIMES OF PEOPLE MIGHT GET. KENNECOTT A TRAP WHERE THEY DON'T INTEND TO VIOLATE THE LAW. OUR INTENTION IS. TO LIVE ENOUGH FLEXIBILITY WHERE SOMEBODY IS NOT ALLEGING IN OUT I TALK TO YOU THREE TIMES NEED AND DISCLOSE THE CONFLICT BUT YOU'RE ENTERING INTO A RELATIONSHIP WITH. THE AGENT. AT IF THAT IS AN AREA THAT I THINK WE COULD BENEFIT FROM HAVING THE INDUSTRIES AND PUT ON. I THINK THEY ARE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO DO AND THEY IN FACT STATED THAT WHERE WOULD WE PROBABLY MISSED THE MARKET WOULD BE GREAT TO. HAVE SOME PROPOSED LANGUAGE IF THEY FEEL LIKE THAT DOES MISS THE MARK I'M WITH YOU KNOW IT'S AYE AYE. AYE ALSO NOT IN THE INDUSTRY IT'S VERY HARD SO WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH BOTH SIDES OF THE INDUSTRY THOSE THAT REPRESENT ONLY TENANTS IN THOSE THAT DO TO AGENTS. TECH TO COME UP WITH THE APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE SO IT'S NOT A GOTCHA IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE A GOTCHA IT'S MEANT. TO ENSURE THAT FOLKS ARE INFORMED TIME IN A TIMELY MANNER. PRIOR TO THE POINT WHERE THEY'RE JUST SITE READY SIGNING THE LEASE. AND YOU KNOW JUST GOING THROUGH ALL THE DISCLOSURES WHICH OFTEN HAPPENS NOW AND THAT. PEEPER CLEAR IN THE RELATIONSHIP THAT THEY HOLD WITH A WITH AGENT. OKAY YEAH I DON'T I DON'T. MS US QUESTION I DON'T KNOW UNKNOWN OF WHAT COMMENCES LESSIG TO MAYBE THAT MAY THAT IS RIGHT LANGUAGE. MAYBE IT SHOULD SAY WHEN YOU RETAIN EVER PRO BROKER AGENTS OR I DON'T. MEANS I JUST I'M NOT SURE I DON'T THINK THOUGH IT IN THE RETAINING ASPECTS NOT LIKE ATTORNEYS LET'S NOT SIGNED YET RETAINER AND YOU'RE NOT GIVING MONEY SO IT'S A KIND OF I THINK A LITTLE BIT MORE. NEBULOUS AND SOMETHING I THINK WE HAVE TO WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK ON TO ENSURE IT'S NOT ABACHA. OKAY. A MISS ANY OF YOU ASKED IF SOMEONE FROM OPPOSITION ALSO CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS. ASSUMING THAT'S WHERE YOUR THAT WOULD DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS ABOUT THAT THE TIMING ISSUE ON WHETHER THIS LANGUAGE IN SECTION SEE. IS THIS THE ADEQUATE. SO WHAT I WAS HAVING TO CLARIFY SOMETHING AND BEEN SAD THAT ME I'M DISCLOSURES ARE GIVEN AT THE END OF THE TRANSACTION AND UNDER CURRENT LAW. THE DISCLOSURE MUST BE GIVEN PRIOR TO THE PRESENTATION OF AN OFFER SO IN IN A SALE SITUATION. THEY MUST BE PRESENTED TO THE BUYER PRIOR TO AN OFFER BEING PRESENT INTO THE CELLAR SO ALESSI'S LESSORS SITUATION IT'S THE SAME THING IT'S NOT OCCURRING AT THE END OF THE TRANSACTION. IT'SOCCURRING PRIOR TO AN OFFER BEING PRESENTED SO WOULD OFFER TO THE SPACE. IT IS NOT GOING TO WE'RE NOT STREAMLINING THE DISCLOSURE PROCESS WE ARE ADDING A THIRD DISCLOSURE SO THIS DISCLOSURE AS REQUIRED BY THE SPELL. WOULD COME AT SOME NEBULOUS TIME THAT WERE UNSURE OF WHEN THAT HAPPENS AS AND SOON AS PRACTICABLE IS LEADING TO TING CURRENT LAW BUT THIS IS AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE. UPON THE BEGINNING OF LICENSE ACTIVITY BUT LICENSE ACTIVITY CAN OCCUR BEFORE EVEN TO RELATIONSHIP EVER OCCURS SO WE INFORMING SOMEONE WHO IS NOT OUR CLIENT. THAT. THERE'S THE POSSIBILITY OF AGENTS OF DUAL AGENCY IT'S JUST IT'S VERY UNCLEAR AS TO WHEN THIS WOULD OCCUR WHAT ITS PURPOSE IS AND IF IT WOULD ACHIEVE ITS GOALS. SO. ASSUMING THEY WERE ABLE TO FIGURE THAT OUT ITS IT IS STILL A THIRD DISCLOSURE. I'VE AGENCY. OKAY PUTTING ASIDE THE THE. THE NUMBER OF DISCLOSURES FOR SECONDS FOCUSING ON. THE. WHAT WHAT IS IT THAT TYPICALLY CREATES THE AGENCY RELATIONSHIP? I UNDERSTAND. AND THE OTHERS VERY RIGHT IT'S NOT LIKE. A RETAINER AGREEMENT YOU SOME OF THE LAWYER GETS A LITTLE BIT MORE AMBIGUOUS OR NEBULOUS I GUESS BUT. I MEAN WHAT WHAT IS THAT TYPICAL TRIGGERING OF THAT. I DON'T KNOW THERE IS A TYPICAL TRIGGERING A THAT THERE IS AYE THERE'S A VARIETY OF TRIGGERING EVENTS THAT CAN OCCUR THAT CAN ESTABLISH AGENCY. TYPICALLY ONCE A WEEK LICENSEES BEGINS TO ENGAGE. IN LICENSE ACTIVITIES FOR. THE PART THAT SAME YOU CALL ME I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT A PROPERTY I GIVE YOU INFORMATION ABOUT THAT PROPERTY WEEK ARE ARGUABLY IN AN AGENCY RELATIONSHIP. AND IF IF YOU CALL ME AND ASK ME DE CHRISTINE DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS PROPERTY ARE THEIR LEAKS R. THERE YOU KNOW IS THERE MOLD AND IF I ANSWER THAT QUESTION. WERE PROBABLY ARGUABLY IN AN AGENCY RELATIONSHIP. SO. I AM WHEN WE ENTER INTO AN AGENCY RELATIONSHIP I HAVE DUDE I'D FIDUCIARY DUTIES YOU AMONGST OTHER DUTIES AND SO. WHAT? ONCE THAT AGENCY RELATIONSHIP IS ESTABLISHED UNDER CURRENT LAW. THE DISCLOSURE PROCESS FOLLOWS QUITE QUICKLY PRIOR TO SUBMITTING AN OFFER. SO YOU WOULD HAVE YOU WOULD. WE'RE JUST NOT SURE HOW. IS THIS REALLY GONNA HAPPEN EARLIER IS REALLY GOING TO BE MUCH EARLIER THAN THE EXISTING LAW. AND IS IT REALLY GOING TO ACHIEVE WHAT THE GOAL IS. WE ARE VERY CLEAR WE SUPPORT CLEAR AND FULL DISCLOSURE OF AGENCY RELATIONSHIP. A HUNDRED PERCENT. WE SPONSORED AGENCY LA WE WE HUNDRED PERCENT. PLEASE ONLY. ARE WITH HER ON THAT BUT WE JUST CANNOT IN ITS CURRENT FORM IT'S TO UNCLEAR IT'S TOO AMBIGUOUS AND IT'S JUST NOT READY TO GO. BUT IN IN TO ANSWER PART OF THAT THAT QUESTION IF YOU'LL NOTICE IN SEE. THE HOOPS AND I JUST LOST IT THAT IT'S. THE LICENSEE COMMENCES LIGHTS ACTIVITY ON A COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION FOR A PRINCIPLE. SO THE LANGUAGE IS BUILT IN THIS NOTION. ESTABLISHMENT PROBABLY THAT THAT THE THE AGENCIES THAT RELATIONSHIP IS PROBABLY ALREADY BEEN ESTABLISHED SINCE THERE IS IN FACT AS A PRINCIPAL IN THERE. SO THE NOTION WAS TO TRY IT AND ESTABLISH. AND NOTICE THAT IS. FOR AN OFFER NECESSARILY HAS BEEN TENDERED BUT EARLY ON IN THE RELATIONSHIP. WHEN THERE IS ACTIVITY WHEN AGENCY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AT LEAST TO SOME EXTENT THAT BAN THE TENANT HAS KNOWLEDGE BEFORE GOING ANY FURTHER. OF THE POTENTIAL BEFORE. A CONFLICT OF INTEREST THINK THAT WAS THE INTENT AND THAT'S WHY THAT LANGUAGE WAS WRITTEN THAT WAY TO TO TRY AND BUILD IN THE NOTION OF OF AGENCY ALREADY. SCULLY. JUST A BRIEF WE FOLLOW UP ON NOW ARE VICE CHAIRS AYE QUESTIONS SO I I. I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH YOU THAT. I THINK THAT THE PARTIES TO ONE OF THESE TRANSACTIONS. SHOULD NOW IF THERE'S A DUAL AGENCY AND SEEN THAT THE OPPOSITION AGREES THAT TO. I THINK MR FUSE YOU SAID THAT THE EXISTING DISCLOSURES ARE ARE INEFFECTIVE RIGHT. AND SO DOES THIS BILL SUPERSEDE THOSE EXISTING INEFFECTIVE DISCLOSURES. OR DOES IT EVEN PLACE. NOT SURE THAT IT LEAVES THEM A PLACE BECAUSE EXISTING DISCLOSURES DON'T JUST HAVE TO DO WITH DUAL AGENCY IT'S ON A VERY SAFE YOU SEE TINY PRINT TWO PAGE FORM WHICH INCLUDES. THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF A BUYER'S AGENT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF A SELLER'S AGENT SO IT'S AN AGENCY DISCLOSURE IT'S NOT SPECIFIC TO THE INDIVIDUAL DUAL EGYPT RIGHT SO. SO IT'S THE SAME DISCLOSURE THAT. THAT YOU AS A TENANT AT THAT HE HE SOLELY REPRESENTS TENANTS AT THE SAME DISCLOSURE HE HAS TO PRESENT HIS CLIENTS AS A DUAL AGENT DOES. AND YOU BASICALLY HAVE TO READ THROUGH ALL THE SMALL FINE PRINT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT. WHAT SITUATION YOU'RE AN ICE? YOU KNOW THERE'S A WAY TO CONSOLIDATE ALL OF THIS AND ONE AND A SIMPLER FORM. I THINK YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS THE PUBLIC DISCLOSURE DRAPER AND SO I HAVE IN A NUMBER OF OTHER AREAS TRIED TO SIMPLIFY AND MAKE. MORE COMMON LANGUAGE FOR A DISCLOSURE WHERE THERE'S A SPECIFIC ISSUE THE SPECIFIC ISSUE IS WHEN HAVE A BUYER'S AGENT OR SELLER'S AGENT YOU DON'T HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF A CONFLICT OF INTEREST. WHEN YOU HAVE A DELAYED AND SEE YOU HAVE A VERY REAL AND WE KNOW THAT IN. IN LA ON OUT A VERY REAL IN AS ATTORNEYS EVEN LIKE. A I THINK WE CAN BE A LITTLE CONFUSED HAVE A FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY TO BOTH THE BUYER AND THE SELLER. I CAN IMAGINE THAT THAT'S VERY TOUGH I I'M NOT EVEN SURE HOW. SOMEBODY DOES THAT BUT I'M GONNA NOT WE'RE NOT GOING THERE I'D YOU KNOW STARTED THEREIN. WE'RE NOT GONNA GO THERE BUT THAT DAY IS SO. WERE TRYING TO GET TO THAT CASE THAT WHEN THERE'S LITTLE AGENCY WHEN IT'S CLEAR THAT A AN AGENT IS REPRESENTING BOTH SIDES THAT THERE JUST CLEAR WITH THE CONSUMER. I'M WE'RE NOT TRYING TO TO STACK THE DECK WE JUST THINK THAT THAT THE CONSUMER THE CLOUD THE. OUTSIDE TENANT HAS HAS THE RIGHT IN SHOULD KNOW ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH OF MEGA CORPORATIONS THAT THE PERSON WHO IS REPRESENTING YOU IS ALSO REPRESENTING THE LAMB ART. EARLY ON I MEAN I GUESS WE COULD TAKE THE DUAL AGENCY BUT THAT THERE'S OTHER SPECIFIC LANGUAGE I HATE THESE THINGS I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW EYES AND. LET'S BE HONEST I MEAN WE'VE DONE THIS FOR YEARS IT'S LIKE THE. THE THE POSTERS THAT WE PUT UP ON LABOR LAW LIKE AT SOME POINT IT'S BECOME SO RIDICULOUS AND THIS ISN'T THE ONLY DISCLOSURE FORM THAT THEY'RE FIGHTING. SO THIS IS WHAT I DO HERE. HERE SIGN THIS OKAY AND BY THE WAY HERE'S THAT THE OFFICIAL OFFERS I'VE DONE IT BEFORE THE OFFERING HERE'S THE OTHER EIGHT PAGES OF DISCLOSURE THAT I HAVE TO GIVE YOU ABOUT EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD. AM WELL YOU KNOW I I GUESS. WHERE PRODUCT OF OUR OWN? AND HOW DOES THIS HELP THE SITUATION BECAUSE WHEN YOU COME TO ME SAY HEY. KEVIN WE'RE GOING TO WORK YOU KNOW I WORKED WITH YOU BEFORE I LOOK INTO PLACE IT'S DOWN THE STREET YOU KNOW CAN YOU CHECK THIS OUT FOR ME AND YOU SAY. I I'D LOVE TO I I NEED TO GIVE YOU THIS I'M HERE. VERY SIMPLE ME GIVE YOU. TWO PARAGRAPHS I'M A DUAL AGENT. YOU MIGHT CONSIDER THAT A CONFLICT MAYBE NOT. BUT. HE SIGNED US BEFORE WE ENTERED INTO THIS. OKAY I'M I MEAN I CERTAINLY LIKE BE IN INTENDED JUST SEEMS LIKE WE'RE GONNA NOW HAVE. EVEN IF WE ASSUME THAT THIS IS AN EFFECTIVE DISCLOSURE THAT WHEN IT IS SOMETIMES NOT NECESSARILY CONVINCED OUT NOW WE HAVE TO AN EFFECTIVE DISCLOSURE THAN ONE EFFECT IS CLOSURE AND I'M. NOT SURE HOW THAT IMPROVE THE SITUATIONS I GUESS. WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE IS ALL THE PARTIES WHO SEEM TO AGREE ON THE PRINCIPLE OF OF EFFECTIVE DISCLOSURE TO TRY TO? ACTUALLY MAKE THAT HAPPEN. WHICH I I'M JUST NOT SURE THIS REALLY DOES THAT. I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO TAKE SUGGESTIONS I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THE SPELL FOR A HERE FLAT. AND I. YOU KNOW IT NOT EVERYBODY SEEMS TO WANT COULD NOT HAVE PROBLEMS BUT NOT OFFER OF SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS SO. I HAD. THIS THIS TO ME IS VERY CLEAR IT'S IT'S A COUPLE SENTENCES THAT TELL SOMEBODY WIENER INTERNING INTO A RELATIONSHIP THAT THERE COULD POSSIBLY IT COULD BE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST. THAT'S IT. ISRAEL. THANK YOU. I THINK WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH THE REAL ESTATE WOULD YOU DO HAVE SOME WHO HAVE MORE KNOWLEDGE SOME WILL HAVE LESS THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. I THINK THAT. FULL DISCLOSURE. TRANSPARENCY OR ARE VERY IMPORTANT OR TWO AREAS AND THEY HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED. ALREADY. BUT I AM. STILL CONFUSED ABOUT SEE. ABOUT. THE LICENSED ACTIVITY. TO WHAT DEFINES A LICENSE LICENSED ACTIVITY BUT I'M HEARING FROM YOU THAT THAT IS AN AREA THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO TALK TO THE OPPOSITION ABOUT. AND I FROM THE OPPOSITION SOUNDS LIKE THEY HAVE IDEAS ON WHAT LICENCED ACTIVITY WOULD TO BE. SO THAT IS AN AREA THAT YOU ARE STILL WILLING TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO MAKE SURE YOU GET. THAT DEFINED. WELL THERE IS A DEFINITION. FOR LICENSE ACTIVITY IN THE BNP CODE AND IT'S ANY ACTION THAT REQUIRES AN INDIVIDUAL TO BE LICENSED TO DO THAT. SO I THINK THAT'S CLEAR IF THAT IF IF THERE IS A REASON WHY THAT DOESN'T WORK. FOR THE OPPOSITION WOULD BE HAPPY TO. MAKE THAT MORE CLEAR AYE BUT THERE IT'S IN DEFINITION IT'S JUST THAT YOU KNOW IF THEY NEED A FLEXIBILITY OF TOM AND I DON'T. THE PROBLEM I MEAN NONE OF US KNOW THE EXACT AND. INDUSTRY I DON'T THINK ANYONE ON ON THIS PANEL BUT IF THEY'RE THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME FLEXIBILITY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO AVOID. IS THAT SITUATION WHERE YOU SIT DOWN WITH SOMEBODYAND YOU GIVE THEM. THIS DISCLOSURE WHICH. ONLY ONE THIRD OF RELATES TO YOU NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE BECAUSE THERE'S THREE DIFFERENT AGENCIES DESCRIBED HERE. AND THEN YOU SIGN AND THEN YOU GET THE FORMAL OFFER ALTHOUGH YOU COULD HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE OFFER IS. AND. WITH ALL THE PARAMETERS SQUARE FOOTAGE TRIPLE NET WHATEVER IT IS RIGHT AND THEN YOU'RE GIVEN THAT. I THINK IT'S AN EIGHT PAGE DISCLOSURE VERY LENGTHY ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE WHERE E.. YOU KNOW YOU JUST. EVERYTHING BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE DO NOW. WHAT WE TRY TO AVOID IS THAT SITUATION WHERE UP FRONT WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH LOOKING FOR A PLACE I'M A TENANT? I'M A SMALL BUSINESS WHO JUST WANTS TO FIND A PLACE TO PUT MY D'ELIA GOT THREE POSSIBLE AREAS TO BE IN THAT AREA THAT I WANT TO BE. AND I CALL SOMEBODY AND SAY IN THAT THERE LIKE THEY KNOW THAT THEY REPRESENT ALSO THAT THE LANDLORDS IN THOSE THREE AREAS BUT THEY'RE JUST UP FRONT THAT'S ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN UP FRONT IMPROVE IT BY. TWO SENTENCES THAT SAY I MIDDLE AGED. IF THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CONCERN IS. I THINK IT'S GOOD FOR PEOPLE HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR AGENTS AND TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT SO IF WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT. FURTHER CLARIFY WHAT LICENSE ACTIVITY WHAT WOULD TRIGGER. A SITUATION BY WHICH I THINK WE CAN USE LIT WE DID UNITS LOOSE LANGUAGE ON THE LICENSE ACTIVITY BECAUSE IT WE STILL GIVE THEM YOU KNOW. CALLIE. YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE ON THE PHONE AND SOMEBODY'S CALLING YOU AND ASKING YOU KNOW YOU YOU MIGHT HAVE TO DO WHEN YOU'RE IN PERSON AND SEE THEM RIGHT I'M. SO. I'D BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT'S WHY I THINK I THINK IT'S EASY TO SAY WELL LET'S NOT DO IT BECAUSE I'M. BECAUSE THE OPPOSITION WILL PROVIDE POSSIBLE LANGUAGE. THE OTHER AREA WAS ON THE ON THE. DISCIPLINE ACTION THAT ASPECT OF IT. WHERE? IT AND IT CAN GO UP TO LOSING THE LICENSE BUT IT INCLUDES ASSOCIATED LICENSEES. IT. IS THERE SOME WORD THAT DESCRIBES THE THE CONDUCT AND. IN THE QUESTION WAS ASKED BY. MEMBER CUNNINGHAM. IS THAT WHAT POINT IS AT THE TO GET TO LOSE A LICENSE AND IF YOU'RE AN ASSOCIATE LICENSEE DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE WORKED ON THAT TRANSACTION BECAUSE I WASN'T CLEAR FROM THE LANGUAGE. IS THAT EVERYBODY ASSOCIATED WITH THAT FIRM FOR THAT THE REALTOR WHO DO ENTERED INTO THE TRANSACTION. O. IS IT SOMEONE WHO PARTICIPATED OR JUST IS A MEMBER OF THAT EIGHT DATA FIRM. SO. IF I CAN'T AFFORD TO THE COMMITTEE A TWENTY HELPED US WITH THIS LANGUAGE I BELIEVE AND I'M AYE. I UNDERSTOOD THAT WE WERE AYE. PUTTING INTO THE BILL WHAT WAS IN EXISTENCE THE BNP BECAUSE. I'M FOR POSSIBLE PENALTY. I DON'T WANNA MISS STATE THOUGH IF I GOT MY AROUND. YEAH I THINK THAT'S TRUE IN THIS IS. THIS IS LIFTING SORT OF WHAT WAS IN EXISTENCE AND AND PUTTING IT IN HERE GIVING THE. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE ABILITY TO TO LEVY. PENALTIES IN IN CASES IN AYE I GUESS EFICACES EGREGIOUS ENOUGH OF THIS SECTION DOES DESCRIBE. POTENTIAL. MALFEASANCE THAT'S MUCH BROADER THAT WHAT WE'RE SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT HERE AND AS IT WAS OFFER BEFORE PERHAPS IT IS BETTER JUST MAKE A CROSS REFERENCE. TO BACK TO THIS PROVISION IN BEING PAY. YEAH I DON'T THINK WERE TRYING TO CREATE A NEW SYSTEM BY WHICH SOMEBODY IS THE US JAPAN BUT USE THE EXISTING SYSTEM WHERE ALL THESE THINGS ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT DEPENDING LIKE. OBVIOUSLY IF THERE IS A FRAUD BY AN ENTIRE AGENCIES ARE AT A TIRE FIRM TO DETECT. DEFRAUD PEOPLE PERHAPS EVERYBODY WOULD LOSE THEIR LICENCE WE'RE NOT TRYING TO CREATE SOMETHING NOW SO I I'D BE HAPPY TO JUST SIMPLY REFERENCE. ANOTHER SECTION. BUT THANK YOU. THANK MISTER CHAIR I JUST HAVE A STATEMENT AND MY APOLOGIES I'D WANTED TO. BE HERE FOR THE ENTIRE DISCUSSION I'M JUGGLING A COUPLE OF COMMITTEES. ON I WAS REALLY SURPRISED IN THE INTERIM HOW MANY MEDIA REQUESTS I WAS ASKED TO TAKE ABOUT THIS BILL. AND AND FIRST I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT IT IS NOT AT THIS MOMENT A BAN ON DUAL AGENCIES AND YOU'VE SHIFTED IT TO DISCLOSURE. I DO THINK THAT THERE STILL IS LACK OF CLARITY IN THE LANGUAGE AND. IF THIS COMMITTEE WANTS TO MOVE IT FORWARD. AND IF I SUPPORTED HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE ARM I JUST WANNA SAY UP FRONT THAT I'M GONNA RESERVE MY RIGHT AND MY VOTE ON THE FLOOR DEPENDING AYE WITH LANGUAGE GOES BECAUSE I DO HOPE. THAT IT WILL GET TO CLEAR PLACE AND. AND AND I WAS CURIOUS YOU MENTIONED THAT OPPOSITION HAS NOT YET GIVEN LANGUAGE TOO CLARIFIED I WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE OBVIOUSLY ALL OF EVER ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TO TO HOPEFULLY COME TO THE TABLE AND GET TO A BETTER RESULT. AREI THINK WE ALL KNOW HOW CONFUSING THESE DISCLOSURES CAN BE AND AND I CERTAINLY AM ONE WHO. AT LEAST IN DIFFERENT REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS I'VE SEEN IN MY TIME. THE IT'S VERY CONFUSING AND AND AT THE END OF THE DAY WE ALL WANT CLARITY I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE ON THAT PRINCIPLE THE QUESTION IS HOW WE GET THERE SO. I IF THIS COMMITTEE DOES THINK WE SHOULD MOVE THIS FORWARD. JUST WANNA. RESERVE AGAIN. DISCUSSION A IN THE FUTURE ON CLARITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS QUESTIONS JUST OLD THANK YOU I'D. MY APOLOGIES I HAVE TO. GET TO ANOTHER COMMITTEE THAT'S NOW ENDED UP BUT I DID WANT TO BE HERE AND BE A PART OF THE AT LEAST HEAR THE PRESENTATION I THINK I. CERTAIN BEEN CLEAR THROUGH THE PROCESS WHEN THIS WAS MORE OF AN AGGRESSIVE BILL ON DUAL AGENCY MY OPPOSITION. I'M STILL NOT THERE. I FEEL THAT. AND AS I REVIEW THE DOCUMENTS AND I ALSO SEE HELD SOME OF. YOU KNOW SOMETIMES YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SMALL NUMBER OF OPPONENTS OR OR PROPONENTS AND A LOT OF PEOPLE OPPOSED BUT THESE ARE ALL PEOPLE WITHIN THE INDUSTRY. WHO ARE? SINGING FROM THE SAME HYMN BOOK AND AS A. AS A LICENSE. AGENT AND. BROKER IN THE STATE. SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE I THAT OPERATE UNDER THESE. OUR GUIDELINES FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO OPERATE UNDER DUAL AGENCY. AND I WILL NEVER SAY THAT ANYTHING IS PERFECT I WILL NEVER SAY THAT. IT ACCOMPLISHES EVERYTHING THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE. HAPPEN BUT I DO THINK THAT. AND AND WHEN AGENTS AREN'T PERFORMING UNDER THE THE GUIDELINES AS THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO THERE IS RECOURSE. AND I BELIEVE THAT. CAN THIS BE MADE BETTER. PROBABLY CAN BE. IS THIS TE APPROACH THAT GETS US THERE. I'M NOT THERE YET AND AND SO I WILL BE LAYING OFF THE BILL TODAY. SHOULD IT OF PROGRESS IN THE PROCESS. THEN I KNOW THAT THE OPPOSITION WILL NEED TO COME TOGETHER AND SORT OF BE CLEAR I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS ANOTHER TRACK THAT THE SEEMINGLY R. ON WHICH I WASN'T CLEAR OF. UNTIL. OF THE ONE SPEAKER SHARE THAT WITH US IN TERMS THE BE BE MP PROCESS. OB SO I THINK THAT'S GOOD BUT I DO. I THINK THAT IF THERE. WAS AN OPPORTUNITY THAT THEY COULD HAVE TAKEN AND DID NOT TAKE. TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU TO TRY TO BE AT LEAST CLEAR ON WHAT THEY CAN. AT TO THIS BILL AS IT RELATES TO DIS. S. TYPE OF DISCLOSURE. THEN THEY SHOULD HAVE. BUT THAT WOULD NOTWITHSTANDING. MY OWN PERSONAL. EXPERIENCE THROUGH THIS PROCESS WOULD LEAD ME NOT TO BE THERE TO SUPPORT IT TODAY BUT I JUST WANTED TO. BEFORE I RUN OUT OF HERE BEFORE THE VOTE I WANT TO BE CLEAR. SHARING THAT WITH. THANK YOU SMIDGE AYE. I WOULD LIKE TO KEEP MY FLIGHT HOME AS ENJOYABLE AS POSSIBLE SO I'M GONNA EXPLAIN OPERANT MATT TODAY. SO I HAVE SOME THOUGHTS. I HAVE SOME THOUGHTS. IN IT FOR SEPTEMBER CENTRALLY I MET WITH PROPONENTS YESTERDAY. AND AT THAT TIME I DID HAVE A COPY THE BELLS AYE I JUST HAVEN'T READ IT YET SO I WILL BE LAYING OUT TODAY JUST FOR THAT REASON BUT I DO HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT GOING FORWARD. I LIKE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO I THINK THE DISCLOSURE AND TRANSPARENCY THINGS GREAT. YOU IRONICALLY ON THIS PAST MONEY BECAUSE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. HELPING OUT PEOPLE WHO AREN'T SOPHISTICATED BUT THE BUT THE PROPONENTS AND THE OPPONENTS ARE HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED SO IT SEEMS LIKE ON SOME OF THIS LANGUAGE THAT THERE OUGHT TO BE WAIT. TO GET TOGETHER AND SORT OF WORK OUT. THE YOU KNOW EVERYBODY UP HERE IS EITHER TRYING TO YOU KNOW LIKE WE ARE A LITTLE BIT TRYING TO PLAY LAWYER OR. TRYING TO WORK OUT SOME THESE. ISSUES FROM HERE AND IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT IT SEEMS LIKE THERE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO BE AN EXCHANGE OF LANGUAGE THAT WORKS OUT THESE THINGS SO. I'M GLAD I KNOW YOU I KNOW YOU'VE WORKED A LOT ON THIS FOR A LONG TIME SO. I AND I STILL ONE I AT STAY INVOLVED IN IT I GET SOME OTHER THOUGHT ON ON SOME OF THE POINTS THAT OTHER PEOPLE RAISING THAT MAY GO. SOME WAY TOWARDS GETTING. READ OF SOME OF THESE ISSUES ARE AND YOU HAD MENTIONED SORT OF THE LABOR YOU KNOW ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW YOU GO ON A BREAK FROM ANYWHERE. AND IT'S JUST WALL TO WALL FINE PRINT AND AND SO AS A RESULT NO ONE READS IT RIGHT RIGHT. BUT YET ON SOME SINCE WE STILL KEEP DO HERE RIGHT WE STILL KEEP THAT OUT HAVING THEM PUT UP ORE WHEN THEY'RE NOT READING THE ONES THAT ARE THERE. WITH SOME OF THESE I THINK I'VE YOU KNOW I GET AGAIN JUST FROM THAT SORT OF THE TESTIMONY TODAY WHAT I'M. YOU KNOW SORT OF IMPLYING FROM BEING UP HERE. IS. THAT SOME OF THE CONCERN THAT THE OPPONENTS HAVE IS WE CAN OTHERS MULTIPLE FORMS. WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT REALLY SURE AND IN THE PENALTY COULD BE SEVERE RIGHT IT COULD BE VERY SEVERE ARE NOT REALLY SURE LIKE HOW MANY FORMS. IN IN ESSENCE R. ARE AT NOW HAVING THREE FOUR THREE FORMS ISN'T GONNA MAKE EVEN IF ONE OF THEM SIMPLER. ISN'T GONNA MAKE THE OVERALL PROCESS SIMPLER WHAT WE'VE DONE A LOT OF TIMES THEY LIKE WITH BUYING A HOUSE RIGHT WE DID ALL THESE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THAT ALL THESE REFORMS. AND WHAT IT ENDED UP DOING IS YOU GET A STACK THIS BIG AND YOU MAY SEE YOU KNOW THE FIRST FIVE OR SIX SEVEN YOU'RE READING BUT BY THE END YOU'RE JUST SIGNING. EVERYTHING I. SO I MEAN I YOU KNOW I'D I'D BE HAPPY TO STAY INVOLVED YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME AND THE GUY SITTING NEXT YEAR ON THE PLANE. SO I'D BE HAPPY TO KNOW THAT IT'S LIKE. THAT. BUT I.% LIVE THE DRINK COUPONS SO. HOW DOES NOT GIVE YOU MINE? I'VE STILL GOT A LOT. MANY MATT I'M CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE TO HELP. WOULD LIKE TO SEE OBVIOUSLY SEE IT ACTUAL COPY OF THE BILL. AND AND READ IT. AND THEN CERTAINLY WOULD. YOU KNOW BE INCLINED AS IT COMES AS GETS MORE THROUGH THAT PROCESS TAKE CONTINUE WORKING ON IT SO DOCUMENTS CHAO. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS. COMMENTS. ALRIGHT SING NONE WAS CONSULT YOU MAY CLOSE. I AM I JUST YOU KNOW. THIS HAS BEEN A YEAR LONG PROCESS. AND I'VE LEARNED A LOT AYE I STILL BELIEVE THAT MY JOB HERE IS TO REPRESENT MY CONSTITUENTS AND WHEN. I'M. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE TYPE OF AGREEMENTS THAT MY CONSTITUENTS AT. HAVE TO ENTER. I'M WHO ARE NOT SOPHISTICATED OFTEN DON'T HAVE ATTORNEYS I HAVE NO IDEA ON A TRIPLE FORM OF AGENCY HAD DISCLOSURES WHICH ONE THERE'D BEEN FALLING UNTIL. THAT WE ARE SELLING THEM SHORT. I'M YES THERE IS A LOT OF OPPOSITION MISTER HOLDEN WAS CRACKED. THAT'S BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY. ITEM THAT HAS TO BE DISCLOSED UPON AS IS VERY LARGE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT. THE INDUSTRY THAT REPRESENTS ONLY TENANTS OR TENANTS THEMSELVES IS VERY SMALL. A IT'S A IT'S WE HAVE IT A HUGE IMBALANCE OF POWER HERE IN THAT'S OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO CRACK THINGS SO. I'M I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED AYE GIVEN HOW MUCH I HAVE CHANGED THAT SPELL. ITEM AND NOT GOING TOWARDS BEGINNING TO AGENCY ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY AND AND WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE THIS OUT. I BELIEVE HONESTLY I'M UNFORTUNATELY THAT THE OPPONENTS AT OPPOSITE OPPOSE MUST AMENDED THEY DID HAVE LANGUAGE. THAT THAT THEIR LACK OF ABILITY TO PROVIDE THAT LANGUAGE IS BECAUSE THEY KNOW. BY NOT DOING THAT THAT YOU WOULD BE STUCK IN A SITUATION OF YES OR NO. I'M. I'M MORE THAN HAPPY AS THINGS MOVE FORWARD TO LOOK AT. AT THE INDUSTRY WHO'S CONTROLLING THE SITUATION THERE FIX IS TO IT. THINK THOSE BILLS COME TO MY COMMITTEE. BUT I I WOULD LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY AND I WOULD ASK FOR A PERSONAL OPPORTUNITY CA TEAM OF THIS BILL FORD SO THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY. I FORCED THE OPPOSITION TO IT TO WORK ON SOME LANGUAGE AND TO SUBMIT WHAT THAT AMENDMENT WOULD LOOK LIKE TO ACTUALLY NEGOTIATE. ON. I RESPECT THE ASPIRIN ABOUT. THANK YOU.
