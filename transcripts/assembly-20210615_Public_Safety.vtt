01:03:55.064 --> 01:03:57.466
THE COURT'S INTERPRETATION. OF

01:03:57.533 --> 01:03:59.101
WHAT IT MEANS THAT WE DON'T

01:03:59.168 --> 01:04:00.937
HAVE INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE AND

01:04:01.003 --> 01:04:03.739
PRISONS. IT COULD BE THAT

01:04:03.806 --> 01:04:06.242
NOTHING CHANGES OR COULD BE

01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:08.177
EVERYTHING CHANGES IT ALL

01:04:08.244 --> 01:04:10.446
DEPENDS UPON THE COURTS. WHAT

01:04:10.513 --> 01:04:11.948
WE REALLY NEED TO DO AND THIS

01:04:12.014 --> 01:04:13.382
IS TRUE WHETHER THIS AMENDMENT

01:04:13.449 --> 01:04:16.018
PASSES OR NOT IS AS A

01:04:16.085 --> 01:04:17.753
LEGISLATURE AND I WOULD HOPE

01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:19.789
YOU WOULD LEAD THIS EFFORT. TO

01:04:19.855 --> 01:04:22.992
COME UP WITH NEW RULES FOR THE

01:04:23.059 --> 01:04:25.494
DEPARTMENT OF. THE BILL

01:04:25.561 --> 01:04:28.397
ATTENTION CORRECTIONS- SHOULD

01:04:28.464 --> 01:04:31.267
WE BE PAYING MINIMUM WAGE OR

01:04:31.334 --> 01:04:33.336
SOME FRACTION THEREOF. THAT

01:04:33.402 --> 01:04:35.871
WOULD PROBABLY COST ABOUT TWO

01:04:35.938 --> 01:04:38.140
BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR WHICH

01:04:38.207 --> 01:04:38.975
THEN WOULD COME OUT OF OTHER

01:04:39.041 --> 01:04:41.377
PROGRAMS. BUT MAYBE THAT'S AN

01:04:41.444 --> 01:04:43.079
INVESTMENT WE WANT TO MAKE.

01:04:43.145 --> 01:04:44.213
PARTICULARLY IF WE COULD KEEP

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:46.749
THAT MONEY IN TRUST UNTIL A

01:04:46.816 --> 01:04:48.150
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF AND TRUST

01:04:48.217 --> 01:04:50.386
INTO PEOPLE GOT OUT. WE COULD

01:04:50.453 --> 01:04:51.887
HAVE A MUCH LOWER RECIDIVISM

01:04:51.954 --> 01:04:53.689
RATE SO I CAN SEE THE REAL

01:04:53.756 --> 01:04:55.791
ADVANTAGES OF THAT. BUT

01:04:55.858 --> 01:04:57.493
REGARDLESS OF WHAT IT IS WE

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:59.495
DECIDE WE SHOULD DECIDE AND

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:01.530
THAT'S TRUE WHETHER THIS PASSES

01:05:01.597 --> 01:05:04.166
OR NOT. SO WHEN YOU'RE CLOSE-

01:05:04.233 --> 01:05:06.035
I'M HOPING THAT YOU WILL PLEDGE

01:05:06.102 --> 01:05:08.070
TO BRING FORWARD A BILL. TO

01:05:08.137 --> 01:05:09.972
DISCUSS WHAT THE PARAMETERS

01:05:10.039 --> 01:05:13.209
SHOULD BE SO THAT WE KNOW THAT

01:05:13.276 --> 01:05:14.977
WE WILL GET REAL CHANGE THANK

01:05:15.044 --> 01:05:19.348

FACT IN NINETEEN ELEVEN- BAILEY

01:07:22.638 --> 01:07:24.306
V. ALABAMA THEY ACTUALLY

01:07:24.373 --> 01:07:27.176
QUESTIONED IT WITH REGARDS TO

01:07:27.243 --> 01:07:30.913
INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE. THIS IS

01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:33.315
ABOUT TAKING THIS ISSUE OUT OF

THIS BODY INTO THE VOTERS IN

01:07:35.918 --> 01:07:36.485
TWENTY TWENTY TWO BY PUTTING IT

01:07:36.552 --> 01:07:39.255
ON A BALLOT- IT COULD BE

01:07:39.321 --> 01:07:40.923
CHALLENGED IN THE COURTS IT

01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:42.324
COULD GO TO THE STATE SUPREME

01:07:42.391 --> 01:07:43.225
COURT IT COULD GO TO THE NINTH

01:07:43.292 --> 01:07:45.261
CIRCUIT- I BELIEVE THEY'RE

01:07:45.327 --> 01:07:46.529
STANDING BECAUSE THERE ARE

01:07:46.595 --> 01:07:48.063
OTHER STATES WHO HAVE ALSO

01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:51.033
PASSED THIS- AND HAVE AND ARE

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:52.835
BEGINNING THE CONVERSATIONS.

01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:56.005
AROUND DIGNIFIED AND

01:07:56.071 --> 01:07:59.308
APPROPRIATE WAGES AND PAY.

01:07:59.375 --> 01:08:01.577
ULTIMATELY- THERE ARE TWO

01:08:01.644 --> 01:08:03.913
ISSUES WHAT. OUR STATE

01:08:03.979 --> 01:08:06.248
CONSTITUTION SAYS AND THEN WHAT

01:08:06.315 --> 01:08:09.452
ARE PENAL CODE SECTION SAYS AND

01:08:09.518 --> 01:08:10.953
OTHER LAWS ON THE BOOKS THAT WE

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:12.254
HAVE AS WELL AS OTHER

01:08:12.321 --> 01:08:13.989
JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE

01:08:14.056 --> 01:08:15.958
STATE. AROUND WHAT IS AN

01:08:16.025 --> 01:08:19.595
APPROPRIATE WAGE AND I HOPE-

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:21.430
THAT AID THIS PASSES AND THAT

01:08:21.497 --> 01:08:22.798
BE WE CAN CONTINUE THE

01:08:22.865 --> 01:08:24.867
CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT IS AN

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:26.669
APPROPRIATE WAGE FOR SOMEONE

01:08:26.735 --> 01:08:30.940
WHO IS INCARCERATED- AND THAT.

01:08:31.006 --> 01:08:32.942
PEOPLE WILL GET UNCOMFORTABLE.

01:08:33.008 --> 01:08:34.810
BECAUSE IT WILL ULTIMATELY

01:08:34.877 --> 01:08:37.079
FORCE FOLKS TO DECIDE. THE

01:08:37.146 --> 01:08:39.515
VALUE OF THE BODY WHILE THEY

01:08:39.582 --> 01:08:42.017
ARE INCARCERATED THE VALUE OF A

01:08:42.084 --> 01:08:44.019
PERSON WHILE THEY ARE

01:08:44.086 --> 01:08:46.689
INCARCERATED. AND I DON'T KNOW

01:08:46.755 --> 01:08:48.524
WHERE THAT WILL LEAD US BUT IT

01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:50.726
SURELY SHOULD LEAD US TO

01:08:50.793 --> 01:08:51.293
SOMEPLACE OTHER THAN EIGHT

01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:53.329
CENTS AN HOUR. YOU KNOW THE

01:08:53.395 --> 01:08:56.565
PENAL CODE SAYS THAT CDCR SHALL

01:08:56.632 --> 01:08:58.601
REQUIRE OF EVERY ABLE BODIED

01:08:58.667 --> 01:09:00.269

BE PRESCRIBED BY THE RULES AND

01:09:12.014 --> 01:09:14.183
REGULATIONS OF THE DIRECTOR F

01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:18.387
CORRECTIONS. WHEN I READ THAT.

01:09:18.454 --> 01:09:20.789
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF. THIS IS

01:09:20.856 --> 01:09:22.124
VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT I WOULD

01:09:22.191 --> 01:09:26.862
HEAR. IN A STORY ABOUT A SLAVE

01:09:26.929 --> 01:09:31.066
OWNER AND A PLANTATION. AND HOW

01:09:31.133 --> 01:09:33.502
DO WE RE ENGINEER. WHAT

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:35.638
CRIMINAL JUSTICE LOOKS LIKE

01:09:35.704 --> 01:09:37.139
WHAT OUR CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM

01:09:37.206 --> 01:09:39.642
SHOULD LOOK LIKE AND HOW WE

01:09:39.708 --> 01:09:43.979
TREAT PEOPLE. THESE ARE REAL

01:09:44.046 --> 01:09:45.848
VESTIGES OF SLAVERY THAT WE ARE

01:09:45.915 --> 01:09:47.149
DEALING WITH THAT YOU ALL DEAL

01:09:47.216 --> 01:09:48.450

01:09:49.818 --> 01:09:51.787
INSTANCES MISTER LOCKHART WHILE

01:11:28.817 --> 01:11:30.419
BEGUN BECAUSE OF FREE LABOR.

01:11:30.486 --> 01:11:32.688
INDENTURED SERVITUDE BACK IN

01:11:32.755 --> 01:11:34.757
ENGLAND WAS ALL ABOUT COMPANIES

01:11:34.823 --> 01:11:36.492
BEING ABLE TO GET THE CHEAPEST

01:11:36.558 --> 01:11:38.894
LABOR EVEN CHILD LABOR. TO BE

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:40.729
ABLE TO KEEP THE ECONOMY GOING.

01:11:40.796 --> 01:11:42.665
REASON WE WERE THREE FIFTHS A

01:11:42.731 --> 01:11:46.068
PERSON BECAUSE YOU CAN'T FORCE

01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:47.136
BEEN INDIVIDUAL TO WORK FOR

01:11:47.202 --> 01:11:50.172
LESS. UNLESS YOU DOWNGRADE THEM

01:11:50.239 --> 01:11:51.573
IN THAT MANNER AND THAT'S WHY

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:52.174
WE WERE ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH

01:11:52.241 --> 01:11:54.043
SLAVERY WHICH BUILT THIS

01:11:54.109 --> 01:11:56.712
COUNTRY. BUILT THIS ON THE

01:11:56.779 --> 01:11:59.114
BACKS OF SLAVES THEY GO ALL THE

01:11:59.181 --> 01:12:01.317
WAY BACK FORTY YEARS AGO. AND

01:12:01.383 --> 01:12:05.754
SO IT'S AN ECONOMIC AND. FOR

01:12:05.821 --> 01:12:08.824
INDIVIDUALS ACROSS READ. JUST

01:12:08.891 --> 01:12:12.094
THINK OF IT- IF WE HAD PAID

01:12:12.161 --> 01:12:14.129
THIS MAN WHAT HE WAS WORTH. I

01:12:14.196 --> 01:12:15.464
NOTICED A SKETCH ABOUT HOW UCH

01:12:15.531 --> 01:12:17.366
MONEY THAT IS BUT WE HAVE PAID

01:12:17.433 --> 01:12:19.001
THIS MAN WHO IS WORTH A

01:12:19.068 --> 01:12:20.402
THOUSAND DOLLARS A WEEK THAT

01:12:20.469 --> 01:12:22.438
YOU WOULD PAY A FIREFIGHTER. HE

01:12:22.504 --> 01:12:24.473
WILL WALK OUT OF PRISON ONE

01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:25.074
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:26.508
TO START HIS LIFE ALL OVER

01:12:26.575 --> 01:12:29.878
AGAIN. YEAH HE ACTUALLY EARNED

01:12:29.945 --> 01:12:33.382
BY PUTTING HIS LIFE ON THE LINE.

01:12:33.449 --> 01:12:36.085
THAT'S REPARATIONS I'M ON

01:12:36.151 --> 01:12:38.654
REPARATIONS ISSUE BE PART OF IT

01:12:38.721 --> 01:12:40.522

AMERICANS LATINOS AND OTHERS

01:12:44.093 --> 01:12:47.162
BEHIND. SO THAT WE EVEN THE

01:12:47.229 --> 01:12:49.164
PLAYING FIELD SO THEY CAN BE

01:12:49.231 --> 01:12:52.568

OTHER THINGS THAT KEPT PEOPLE

01:13:07.916 --> 01:13:09.384

01:36:05.326 --> 01:36:06.427
THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS

01:36:06.494 --> 01:36:07.962
ASSOCIATION OPPOSE PRIMARILY

01:36:08.028 --> 01:36:09.263
BECAUSE THE BILL INCLUDES

01:36:09.330 --> 01:36:11.031
CRIMES INVOLVING CHILDREN THANK

01:36:11.098 --> 01:36:14.835
YOU. THANK YOU SIR. THERE ARE

01:36:14.902 --> 01:36:16.237
NO OTHER PARTICIPANTS CUED UP

01:36:16.303 --> 01:36:19.406
MISTER CHAIR- BRING IT BACK TO

01:36:19.473 --> 01:36:21.275
COMMITTEE OR ANY QUESTIONS OR

01:36:21.342 --> 01:36:26.981
CONCERNS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

01:36:27.047 --> 01:36:32.086
WE JUST DID- HOW MOVE THE BELL

01:36:32.153 --> 01:36:34.922
OKAY CAN YOU ADD ME AS A CO

01:36:34.989 --> 01:36:37.057
AUTHOR I WOULD LOVE TO ASSEMBLY

01:36:37.124 --> 01:36:38.392
MEMBER THANK YOU OKAY WELL I

01:36:38.459 --> 01:36:40.294
LIKE ALMOST EVERYONE IN YOUR

01:36:40.361 --> 01:36:44.031
PATH- SO THE OPPOSITION IS

01:36:44.098 --> 01:36:45.566
COMPLAINING THAT PEOPLE WON'T

01:36:45.633 --> 01:36:49.136
GET PUNISHED- FIRST OF ALL.

01:36:49.203 --> 01:36:51.839
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT

01:36:51.906 --> 01:36:54.241
PUNISHMENT ACTUALLY CAUSES

01:36:54.308 --> 01:36:56.744
THERE TO BE LESS IN THE WAY OF

01:36:56.810 --> 01:36:59.380
DRUG- BILL TAKING DRUGS PEOPLE

01:36:59.446 --> 01:37:01.448
GETTING DRUG OVERDOSES IN FACT

01:37:01.515 --> 01:37:03.250
IT PROBABLY KILLS PEOPLE.

01:37:03.317 --> 01:37:04.952
BECAUSE WHEN THEY'RE GETTING

01:37:05.019 --> 01:37:06.754
DRUNK OF OVERDOSE IS THERE

01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:08.355
SOMEWHERE QUIET OR THEY'RE

01:37:08.422 --> 01:37:10.291
SHARING NEEDLES AND GET HIV AT

01:37:10.357 --> 01:37:13.427
CETERA- IN FACT PORTUGAL IS

01:37:13.494 --> 01:37:17.264
GONE TOO NO PUNISHMENT FOR DRUG

01:37:17.331 --> 01:37:19.266
POSSESSION. THEY STILL GO AFTER

01:37:19.333 --> 01:37:21.035
TRAFFICKERS BUT THERE'S NO

01:37:21.101 --> 01:37:22.703
PUNISHMENT FOR DRUG POSSESSION

01:37:22.770 --> 01:37:25.839
AND PEOPLE STILL. GO INTO

01:37:25.906 --> 01:37:28.542
REHABILITATION FOR IT SO I

01:37:28.609 --> 01:37:31.412
THINK THIS WHOLE EFFORT AT

01:37:31.478 --> 01:37:33.681
PUNISHING PEOPLE FOR DRUG

01:37:33.747 --> 01:37:36.150
POSSESSION IS WRONG BUT- EVEN

01:37:36.217 --> 01:37:38.752
SO I AM VOTING FOR A BILL WHICH

01:37:38.819 --> 01:37:41.355
WILL ALLOW THE JUDGE TO THROW

01:37:41.422 --> 01:37:41.922
THE BOOK AT SOMEONE IF THEY

01:37:41.989 --> 01:37:46.193
WANT TO- AND THE OPPOSITION

01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:47.895
LETTERS YOU'RE SAYING- THEY'LL

01:37:47.962 --> 01:37:49.430
BE NO PUNISHMENT. UNFORTUNATELY

01:37:49.496 --> 01:37:52.233
THERE WILL BE PUNISHMENT- SO

01:37:52.299 --> 01:37:53.567
THAT I THINK THAT THAT

01:37:53.634 --> 01:37:56.937
OPPOSITION ARGUMENT IS WRONG-

01:37:57.004 --> 01:37:58.606
BUT FRANKLY I WISH OF HER

01:37:58.672 --> 01:38:01.275
RIGHT. BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING

01:38:01.342 --> 01:38:03.010
ABOUT SAVING PEOPLE BY

01:38:03.077 --> 01:38:04.078
PREVENTING THEM FROM TAKING

01:38:04.144 --> 01:38:06.714
DRUGS WHEN IN FACT WHAT HAPPENS

01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:09.183
IS THAT WHEN THEY TAKE DRUGS

01:38:09.250 --> 01:38:11.252
RATHER THAN. BEING REALLY

01:38:11.318 --> 01:38:13.454
REHABILITATED THEY OFTEN END U

01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:15.689
IN JAIL WITH A MUCH WORSE LIFE

01:38:15.756 --> 01:38:18.158
THAN THEY WOULD HAVE HAD IF WE

01:38:18.225 --> 01:38:19.593
WEREN'T ENFORCING THESE LAWS.

01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:22.863
SO THAT- THAT'S WHY I'M

01:38:22.930 --> 01:38:24.298
SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND I

01:38:24.365 --> 01:38:25.266
WOULD SUPPORT JUST

01:38:25.332 --> 01:38:27.034
DECRIMINALIZING THAT BEGAN WITH

01:38:27.101 --> 01:38:30.804
THANK YOU. IS THERE ANY OTHER

01:38:30.871 --> 01:38:34.008
COMMENTS ARE CONCERNED. YOU MAY

01:38:34.074 --> 01:38:39.046

01:38:41.015 --> 01:38:44.785
LITTLE BIT SURPRISED BY- THE-

01:38:44.852 --> 01:38:46.353
LATE LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:49.923
OPPOSITION- THEY'VE NOT OPPOSE

01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:52.159
THIS BILL IN THE PAST THE DA'S

01:38:52.226 --> 01:38:54.128
ASSOCIATION ACTUALLY WHEN THIS

01:38:54.194 --> 01:38:55.496
BILL WAS INTRODUCED A FEW

01:38:55.562 --> 01:38:56.397
MONTHS AGO SCORED IN THE

01:38:56.463 --> 01:38:57.998
PROCESS. SENATE THEY HAD NO

01:38:58.065 --> 01:38:59.800
ISSUE WITH THAT SO IT'S A

01:38:59.867 --> 01:39:01.869
LITTLE BIT SURPRISING- AND I DO

01:39:01.935 --> 01:39:03.037
JUST WANT TO MENTION IN TERMS

01:39:03.103 --> 01:39:07.274
OF- MINERS EXISTING LAW CREATES

01:39:07.341 --> 01:39:08.809
A PRESUMPTION AGAINST

01:39:08.876 --> 01:39:12.146
PROBATION- FOR CASES INVOLVING

01:39:12.212 --> 01:39:15.082
MINORS- IT FOR RELATING TO

01:39:15.149 --> 01:39:18.652
COCAINE METH AND HEROIN. BUT

01:39:18.719 --> 01:39:21.388
THEN THERE ARE OTHER DRUGS THAT

01:39:21.455 --> 01:39:22.523
IT BANS PROBATION SO WE'RE

01:39:22.589 --> 01:39:24.692
SIMPLY ALIGNING IT TO CURRENT

01:39:24.758 --> 01:39:27.094
LAW FOR METH COCAINE AND

01:39:27.161 --> 01:39:29.863
HEROIN- SO I JUST DON'T THINK

01:39:29.930 --> 01:39:31.532
ABOUT IS A PARTICULARLY

01:39:31.598 --> 01:39:33.867
COMPELLING ARGUMENT GIVEN THAT

01:39:33.934 --> 01:39:34.768
WERE REALLY JUST ALIGNING

01:39:34.835 --> 01:39:37.504
UNDER. ALREADY EXISTING LAW

01:39:37.571 --> 01:39:38.806

WANTED TO TRUST JUDGES TO MAKE

01:40:10.137 --> 01:40:12.539

PROGRESSIVE BUT MOST IMPORTANT

01:40:41.268 --> 01:40:43.637
HOW JUDGES CAN EVEN CHANGE-

01:40:43.704 --> 01:40:45.272
BECAUSE WE USED TO FILL THEM

01:40:45.339 --> 01:40:46.440

02:09:33.732 --> 02:09:35.167
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT COST

02:09:35.234 --> 02:09:37.336
THAT COULD BE AN ISSUE I THINK

02:09:37.402 --> 02:09:38.737
IT IS WOULD PROBABLY BE A GOOD

02:09:38.804 --> 02:09:41.373
IDEA. TO HAVE YOUR BILL AS AN

02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:44.009
ALTERNATIVE TO SEVEN ONE SEVEN

02:09:44.076 --> 02:09:44.977
SHOULD THE GOVERNOR TO SIGN

DOESN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO

02:09:50.282 --> 02:09:53.752
DO THIS- THAT ALSO SEEMS TO BE

02:09:53.819 --> 02:09:55.287
WE'RE HEARING MANY OF THE SAME

02:09:55.354 --> 02:09:57.356

SEVEN SUPPORTING YOUR BAIL. SO

02:09:59.458 --> 02:10:00.359
AT THE MOMENT AND I AM

02:10:00.425 --> 02:10:02.728
PREDISPOSED TO VOTING FOR IT I

02:10:02.794 --> 02:10:04.563
DO WANT TO HEAR WHAT THE- WHAT

02:10:04.630 --> 02:10:06.732
ARE CHAIR HAS TO SAY ABOUT IT

02:10:06.798 --> 02:10:08.534
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HIS

02:10:08.600 --> 02:10:10.969
POSITION YET. THANK YOU. MR

02:10:11.036 --> 02:10:14.106
LACKEY YEAH I- IN ITS CURRENT

02:10:14.173 --> 02:10:16.008
FORM I'M CLEARLY IN SUPPORT OF

02:10:16.074 --> 02:10:18.410
THIS MEASURE- BUT YOU MIGHT BE

02:10:18.477 --> 02:10:20.779
TALKING ME OUT OF IT-

02:10:20.846 --> 02:10:23.549
EVENTUALLY EMERGING IT WAS

02:10:23.615 --> 02:10:24.616
SEVEN SEVENTEEN AND HERE'S

02:10:24.683 --> 02:10:25.250
HERE'S MY BIGGEST CONCERN OVER

02:10:25.317 --> 02:10:27.052
SEVEN SEVENTEEN. THE DRIVER'S

02:10:27.119 --> 02:10:30.055
LICENSE ISSUE- DOES NOT ADDRESS

02:10:30.122 --> 02:10:30.656
ANY KIND OF BEHIND THE WHEEL

02:10:30.722 --> 02:10:32.724
TRAINING AND I THINK THAT

02:10:32.791 --> 02:10:33.825
THAT'S A PUBLIC SAFETY VOID

02:10:33.892 --> 02:10:37.529
DEBTS- VERY COULD- VERY

02:10:37.596 --> 02:10:40.966
IMPORTANT. AND- SO HAVING A

02:10:41.033 --> 02:10:43.368
FORM OF A GOOD IDENTIFICATION

02:10:43.435 --> 02:10:44.436
IS CLEARLY SOMETHING THAT NEEDS

02:10:44.503 --> 02:10:46.004
TO BE ADDRESSED BUT NOT IN THE

02:10:46.071 --> 02:10:47.739
FORM OF A DRIVER'S LICENSE

02:10:47.806 --> 02:10:50.409
UNLESS THERE'S- A CERTAIN

02:10:50.475 --> 02:10:51.977
DEGREE OF COMPETENCY THAT'S

02:10:52.044 --> 02:10:53.979
DEMONSTRATED BEFORE ISSUING-

02:10:54.046 --> 02:10:55.347
THE DRIVING COMPONENT IS

02:10:55.414 --> 02:10:55.881
PROBABLY ONE OF THE MORE

02:10:55.948 --> 02:10:58.750
CRITICAL ASPECTS. OF THE- THE

02:10:58.817 --> 02:11:00.319
ASSESSMENT PROCESS BEFORE

02:11:00.385 --> 02:11:02.054
GETTING A DRIVER'S LICENSE AND-

02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:03.088
IT WOULD CLEARLY JUST BE

02:11:03.155 --> 02:11:05.123
DISMISSED OR OVERLOOKED. AND I

02:11:05.190 --> 02:11:06.858
FIND THAT TO BE UNACCEPTABLE

02:11:06.925 --> 02:11:08.827
BUT IN THIS CURRENT FORM I'M

02:11:08.894 --> 02:11:10.562
CLEARLY IN SUPPORT AND I THINK

02:11:10.629 --> 02:11:12.998
IT IT ADDRESSES A VERY SERIOUS

02:11:13.065 --> 02:11:14.633
PROBLEM THANK YOU. ANYWHERE I

02:11:14.700 --> 02:11:16.668

02:11:16.735 --> 02:11:18.103
COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU I WAS

NOT IN THE- CONSTRUCTION FOR

02:11:20.205 --> 02:11:22.674
PHASE OF ASSEMBLY BILL SEVEN

02:11:22.741 --> 02:11:23.475
SEVENTEEN WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT

02:11:23.542 --> 02:11:24.610
THE DRIVER'S LICENSE COPONENT

02:11:24.676 --> 02:11:25.611
WOULD HAVE TO BE A RENEWAL

02:11:25.677 --> 02:11:27.379

AND IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN WE

02:11:50.535 --> 02:11:51.536
