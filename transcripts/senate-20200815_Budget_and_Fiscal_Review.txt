WITH US- WE CAN HEAR BOTH FROM THE L. A. L. AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE'RE GONNA START WITH MISS PETERS WITH THE L. A. O. WOULD YOU LIKE TO BEGIN YOUR PRESENTATION GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS- I HAVE A PRESENTATION TO SHARE WITH YOU ON THE SCREEN SO LET ME JUST PULL THAT UP FOR YOU. RIGHT NOW. ARE YOU ABLE TO SEE THAT THE HAND OUT COULD BE NINETEEN FUNDING OVER VIA. ARE YOU ABLE TO SEE THAT PRESENTATION MANAGER. YES I AM THANK YOU IT'S ON A SCREEN HERE THANK. SO AND GOOD MORNING AGAIN I'M SO AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES IN THERE ARE MULTIPLE SOURCES ON BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR DI RACKED AND INDIRECT KOBE NINETEEN RESPONSE IN THIS PRESENTATION I'M GOING TO SPEAK TO THE MORE INDIRECT STATE FUNDING- ALTHOUGH WE ALSO HAVE STAFF AVAILABLE TODAY. IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FEDERAL FUNDING COMPONENTS. ASIAN I'M I'M GONNA TALK FIRST ABOUT WHAT THE FUNDS HAVE BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO THE ADMINISTRATION TO RESPOND TO THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC WHAT THE EXPECTED USES OF THOSE FUNDS ARE AND THE UNCERTAINTY AROUND THOSE EXPECTING USED AS- WELL AS ISSUES FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER REGARDING OVERSIGHT AT THE STATE'S EMERGENCY SPENDING. SO IN THE TURN THAT YOU CAN SEE HERE ON PAGE WIND WE SUMMARIZE. THE STATE FUNDING THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED IN TWO NINETY. TWENTY INTO TWENTY TO RESPOND TO THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE CHART MISTY AUTHORIZED FOUR POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND ANOTHER ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. FOR A TOTAL OF FIVE POINT SEVEN BILLION IN AUTHORIZED SPENDING. THERE'S ALSO OTHER FRIENDS ACCESSIBLE FOR COULD BE NINETEEN RESPONSE ON TOP OF THAT FIVE POINT. SEVEN BILLION THAT'LL TALK ABOUT IN A MOMENT. I'M THE FIRST LET ME JUST TO GO THROUGH THE DIFFERENT SOURCES THAT THE FIVE POINT SEVEN BILLION COMES FROM. THERE'S REALLY THREE DIFFERENT MECHANISMS THAT PROVIDE THAT SPENDING- FIRST CONTROL SECTION THIRTY SIX. HI THIS AYE IT WAS CREATED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN MARCH JUST BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE RECESSED TO OBSERVE THE STATE STATE HOME WHERE. I AM AND THE LEGISLATURE SPECIFICALLY APPROPRIATED ONE BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE STATE'S CODE RESPONSE- AND MAYBE SPENDS ASSESSABLE THREE NEW BUDGET CONTROL SECTION KNOWN AS CONTROL SECTION THIRTY SECS. THESE TRENDS ARE AVAILABLE TO THE MINISTRATION OF CONDESCENDINGLY TO OUR NOTIFICATION TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE OR JAIL WE SEE. THROUGH THIS PROCESS THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ALLOCATED. EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. THIS SOURCE FINDING AND THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED IS THROUGH THE DISASTER RESPONSE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS ACCOUNT OR THREE OUT. THIS ACCOUNT PROVIDES ADMINISTRATION ACCESS TO FANS IN THE STATE RESERVE IS KNOWN AS A SPECIAL PLAN FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES OUR HOUSE I FEED YOU- ANY SPENCER AVAILABLE TO RESPOND TO DECLARE EMERGENCIES ONCE TRANSFERRED INTO THREE- I FUNDS ARE CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED FOR EMERGENCY. RESPONSE ACTIVITIES MINISTRATION IS REQUIRED TO NOTIFY THE GLVC OF TRANSFERS INTO THREE ELLA BUT THERE'S NO REQUIREMENTS TO NOTIFY IN THE LEGISLATURE AT THE ACTUAL ALLOCATION OR EXPENDITURE OF FUNDS OUT OF THREE A LOT I MEAN WE JUST KNOW THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT INCONSISTENT. IN PROVIDING- NOT OPTIONAL. INFORMATION THAT IS NOT REQUIRED. SPAWNING TO COVER NINETEEN DEMONSTRATION HAS MADE TRANSFERS INTO THREE- I TOTALING THREE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS. I WOULD JUST KNOW ALSO AND THIS CHART WHAT WE'RE WE SHOW SOME OF THAT FUNDS ARE BEING APPROPRIATE- PROVIDED AUTHORIZED IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY I'M BECAUSE THOSE RIO I DOLLARS IN PARTICULAR CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED. THEY CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE TO THE MINISTRATION EVEN THOUGH WE'RE IN THE NEW FISCAL YEAR. SOURCE OF FUNDING- COMES FROM THE NINETY NINE OH ONE BUDGET ITEM AS PART OF THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET PACKAGE. SPECIFICALLY THIS ITEM SET ASIDE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO FIND EXPECTED KOBE NINETEEN RESPONSE ACTIVITIES. STRATEGIES THAT DEPARTMENTS ARE MAYBE WORK PLANNING FOR OR HAD ALREADY STARTED IN THE PREVIOUS FISCAL YEAR- AND SO THERE IS AN ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING NEEDED IT'S SEVEN NINETY NINE OF ONE ITEM. AND IS AVAILABLE I'M TO THE MINISTRATION TO BE ALLOCATED OUT TO. AS NEEDED. NOW YOU NEED TO THAT FIVE SEVEN THAT'S OR EVEN AUTHORIZED TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET SET ASIDE EIGHT SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN MILLION FROM THE ASSET THE YOU RESERVE BALANCE. FOR COVERT RESPONSE THIS AMOUNT REPRESENTS THE SEEDS 25% SHARE OF COST OF A TOTAL OF TWO POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN ESTIMATED CONTINGENCY FUNDING. THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AT THE TIME THE BUDGET WAS ENACTED ESTIMATED IT WOULD NEED. LIMITATION CAN ACCESS THESE CONTINGENCY. PLANS THROUGH THE TRAIL ACROSS. NOW IT OF THE SONS HAVE BEEN ON THE THROUGH THE VARIOUS CONTROLS. AND FUNDING PROCESS SEASON IN THE BUDGET- BUT WE JUST KNOW THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS I'M PRETTY PROUD SPENDING AUTHORITIES UNDER THE CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT WHICH ESSENTIALLY WOULD ALLOW THE ADMINISTRATION TO SPEND FUNDS BEYOND THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN THE BUDGET SPECIFICALLY I'M EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT ALSO PROVIDES VARIOUS OTHER POSSIBILITIES TO THE MINISTRATION. TO RESPOND TO AN ONGOING DECLARED EMERGENCY. SO FINDING SOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE NEXT DAY WHEN YOU SPEAK TO HOW THE FUNDS ARE EXPECTED TO BE SPENT. ON HIM THE SIGNIFICANCE AND CERTAINTY AROUND OF THE USE OF THE STATE'S COVERT RESPONSE SPENDING. I'M IN THIS CHART WE SHALL BE AT FIVE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS AUTHORIZED- AND AT THE TIME OF THE BUDGET ENACTMENT. I'M AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S EXPECTED USE ABOUT FIVE POINT SEVEN APPETITE IN THE BUDGET WAS AN ACCIDENT. I'M OF THE PAGER REFLECTS THAT IS. WHILE THIS INFORMATION FROM THE MINISTRATION AS HELPFUL TO GET A SENSE TO THE LEGISLATURE. OF THE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES THAT MIGHT BE FUNDED FROM THEM THE FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE AVAILABLE. AND IT'S ACTUALLY SUBJECT TO SOME UNCERTAINTY FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS. FIRST WE KNOW THA THE ADMINISTRATION IDENTIFIED IN SOME CASES FAIRLY BROAD CATEGORIES OF SPENDING. AS YOU CAN SEE A HIGHCHARGE ON THE ADMINISTRATION AT THE TIME THE BUDGET WAS ENACTED HAD IDENTIFIED. THREE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN ESTIMATED FUNDING NEEDED FOR PROCUREMENTS. I'M HOWEVER DID NOT COMPREHENSIVELY IDENTIFY THE MIX OF THINGS THAT WOULD ACTUALLY. BE PURCHASED WITH THESE DOLLARS. I'M IN A- DIMINISHES HAS FLEXIBLE TO RE ALLOCATE TIMES AMONG SEIZE CATEGORIES OR EVEN INTO NEW CATEGORIES THAT IT IDENTIFIES AS PRIORITIES CHANGE AN ONGOING RESPONSE TO THE COMING. BACK SO THE EXPECTED MIX AND THE USE OF MIND CAN CHANGE- AND ACTUALLY HAS CHANGED ALREADY ABOUT TALK ABOUT INA MOMENT AND AS YOU HEAR ABOUT YOUR NEXT PRESENTATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SO WHILE THE- WHY I'M IT SHOWS ME EXPECTED USED AT THE TIME THE BUDGET WAS ENACTED AT THE FIVE POINT SEVEN BILLION HAD BEEN AUTHORIZED THERE IS STILL THIS TIME TWO POINT NINE BILLION AN ESTIMATED ADDITIONAL EXPENDITURE SUPPORTED BY THAT SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION ASSETS BE USED ANNEX. NOT THAT THE BUDGET WAS ENACTED ADMINISTRATION HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED I'M EXPECTING USES FOR ANY AT THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING- SUPPORTED BY THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN MILLION I'M AND I INFORMATION HAS NOT BEEN PROVIDED TO THE LEGISLATURE UP UNTIL YESTERDAY AFTERNOON WHEN THE ADMINISTRATION HOSTED- AND AUGUST FOURTEENTHUPDATE ON TO THAT- THAT PROVIDED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M DETAILING IT'S EXPECTED HOUSTON UPDATED EXPECTED USE OF THE COPING NINETEEN TIMES. INCLUDING I'M PROVIDING SOME INFORMATION ON IT IT'S EXPECTED USE OF. THESE ADDITIONAL CONTINGENCY FUNDS. I'M THE ARTIST DATE PROVIDED BY THE OF FINE. AND PROVIDES. DIFFERENTLY FOR HOW IT MIGHT SOME OF THESE CONTINGENCY FUNDS DAY INDICATES THAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAD INITIALLY DEVELOPED PLANS FOR SPENDING THAT YOU PULL THAT THE FULL TWO POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS- I'M HOWEVER ADDED THAT CURRENT PLAN AND THAT. TIME HAS BEEN POSTING INDICATES THAT THEY'VE DEVELOPED NOW ONLY ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OUT OF EXPECTED TO USE UP THE SIGNS LEAVING AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS BACK. HI THERE MIGHT NOT BE USED FOR THE EXPECTED USE HAS NOT YET. BEEN IDENTIFIED FOR ACT. NOW WITH THE EVERY PROVIDED IN THAT UPDATE FROM YESTERDAY THE INFORMATION ON THE PLAN YOU SAID THESE FINDINGS I'M HAS CHANGED CONSIDERABLY. SO THE LEGISLATURE HAVE RECEIVED BACK IN MAY ON MAY TWENTY FIRST AN UPDATE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON IT'S EXPECTED USE OF FINES AND THAT'S WHAT WAS KNOWN AT THE TIME OF THE BUDGET AND REFLECTED IN THE PICTURE ON THE PREVIOUS SLIDE. UPDATE FROM YESTERDAY PROVIDES- PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT EXPECTED USES OF THE FANS I'M IN. REALLY LASSEN THREE MONTHS TIME. FOR EXAMPLE THE MINISTRATION AND ANTICIPATES NOW SPENDING ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS I'M STATE RESPONSE OPERATIONS. THIS IS ABOUT NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS MORE THAN THE LEVEL FOR THIS ACTIVITY THAT WAS IDENTIFIED BACK IN BANG. SIMILARLY THE AUGUST ACTING ANTICIPATES SPENDING FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ON HOTEL HOTELS FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS. THIS IS A FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE MILLION MORE THAN THE ONLY THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED FOR THIS ACTIVITY BACK IN MAY SO REALLY JUST OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS AND THE PLANNED EXPENDITURE OF THE SENATE. HAS CHANGED PRETTY CONSIDERABLY. SO SIGNIFICANT LEVEL OF. THAT THE MINISTRATION HAS TO ALLOCATE TIMES INDIAN CERTAINTY AROUND THE ACTUAL USE- OF THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO FACILITATE OVERSIGHT AND THE RECENTLY PROVIDED. KOBE NINETEEN FUNDING. NOW THE MINISTRATION AS WE'VE INDICATED HAS QUITE A BIT OF FLEXIBILITY YOUR EXISTING STATE LAW AS WELL AS THROUGH THE FUNDS PROVIDED IN BY. I'M THIS IS REASONABLE ND WAS PROVIDED RIGHT. IN ORDER TO GET THE MINISTRATION FLEXIBILITY TO RESPOND TO A CHANGING AND EVOLVING SITUATION- AND SO THAT FLEXIBILITY AND- IS REALLY NECESSARY. AT LEAST SOME DEGREE OF FLEXIBILITY FOR THE MINISTRATIONS TO BE NIMBLE ENOUGH AND FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO RESPOND. I ASK THAT COULD BE NINETEEN PANDEMIC CONTINUES TO EVOLVE AND YOU NEEDS ARE DEVELOPED- AND. AND BECOME KNOWN OVER TIME. HOW BECAUSE FLEXIBILITY THAT MINISTRY HAS. HI THE LEGISLATURE REALLY KIND OF LACKS ADEQUATE INFORMATION ON. HOW THE FANS- ARE CLEAN TO BE SPENT AND ARE ACTUALLY BEING SPENT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GETTING THE TYPE OF INFORMATION YOU WOULD GET NORMALLY HAVE WHEN FUNDS ARE AFFECTED IN THE STATE BUDGET- WHERE YOU HAVE A SENSE OF THE TYPES OF PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES THAT ARE GOING TO BE FUNDED AND THERE'S MORE RESTRICTIONS PLACED ON THE USE OF THOSE FUNDS. I'M I SAID BEFORE THE MOST RECENT INFORMATION ON HOW THE ADMINISTRATION PLANS TO ALLOCATE FUNDS WAS PROVIDED JUST YESTERDAY. AND IDENTIFY SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT SPENDING LEVELS OVERALL. PRIORITIES AND THOSE IDENTIFIED ONLY A FEW MONTHS AGO IN THE LEGISLATURE WAS MAKING BUDGET DECISIONS. COPING NINETEEN FRIENDS HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN SPANKED THE INFORMATION HAS ALL FOCUSED ON B. I'M PLANNED ALLOCATION BUT NOT WHAT ACTUALLY HAS HAPPENED WITH. I. WE FIND THAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS NEEDED TO FACILITATE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT HAVING REGULARLY UPDATED INFORMATION ON THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN ALLOCATION OF FUNDS WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONDUCT OVERSIGHT ADMINISTRATION'S PRIORITY AND ITS OVERALL APPROACH IN RESPONDING TO THE CODE NINETY EVER. WHICH CAN SHIFT QUICKLY. SIMILARLY UNDERSTANDING THE ACTUAL EXPENDITURES THE FANS WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR COPING NINETEEN OVERSIGHT FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS. FIRST THE PIECE OF WHICH THE ADMINISTRATION IS SPENDING IT'S CALLED THE RESPONSE FANS WILL BE IMPORTANT TO TRACK FOR EXAMPLE I SPENDING IS OCCURRING VERY RAPIDLY THIS COULD POINT TO THE NEED FOR POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL FUNDING BEYOND THE LEVEL BUDGET IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ON THE OTHER HAND IF SPENDING IS OCCURRING RELATIVELY SLOWLY- THIS COULD ACTUALLY INDICATE SOME POTENTIAL ADMINISTRATIVE BARRIERS WERE CONCERNS ABOUT THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC THAT WOULD MERIT LEGISLATIVE ATTENTION. SECOND THE LEGISLATURE WANNA UNDERSTAND HOW ACTUAL EXPENDITURES ALIGNED WITH THE PLANNED USES THE FINEST AND MINISTRATION HAS INDICATED. AND WHETHER THE EXPENDITURES BEING MADE ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL FEMA REIMBURSEMENTS AND THE PIECE OF RECEIVING THOSE REIMBURSEMENTS I WOULD NOTE THAT AN UPDATE POSTED YESTERDAY BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND ADMINISTRATION INDICATE SOME OF ITS PLANNED EXPENDITURES WILL BE FULLY SUPPORTED BY THE GENERAL FUND AND ARE. NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FEMA REIMBURSEMENT. NOW EXPENDITURE INFORMATION IS GOING TO BE HELPFUL TO THE LEGISLATURE IN ASSESSING THE ADMINISTRATION'S OVERALL SPENDING DECISIONS AND HOW THAT'S IMPACTING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE RESPONSE TO BE EMERGENCY. SO IN MY NEED FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WE HAVE SEVERAL REPORTING OPTIONS TO HIGHLIGHT TO IMPROVE THE OVERSIGHT OF WHAT THE PLAN ALLOCATION OF FUNDS YEAH ON THE ACTUAL EXPENDITURE OF FUNDS. SO FIRST FOR THE PLAN ALLOCATION OF FUNDS THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER SOME WHITE LAST FORMAL TYPES OF REPORTING SECTION AS REQUESTING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION OFFER MEMBER BRIEFINGS TO INTERESTED MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE- KEY POINTS% SUCH AS BEFORE AWARDING MAJOR CONTRACTS- WE WOULD NOTE THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE STAFF THAT. THAT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION HAS BEEN PROVIDING SAM I'M PERIODIC UPDATES TO CERTAIN MEMBERS AND STAFF AND WE'VE HEARD THAT THAT INFORMATION HAS BEEN HELPFUL. ANOTHER OPTION THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN CONSIDER. TO HAVE MORE INFORMATION THE PLANNED OF FUNDS WOULD BE TO REQUIRE OR REQUIRE A MORE OF A FORMAL WRITTEN NOTIFICATION SIMILAR TO THE TYPE OF NOTIFICATION THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED. FOR FUNDING THAT GOES THROUGH THE GLVC SUCH AS TREE OR TRANSFERS. THE LARGEST. COULD I'M REQUIRE OR REQUEST A DEMONSTRATION PROVIDE UPDATES SIMILAR TO THE ONE PROVIDED ON MAY TWENTY FIRST AND YESTERDAY. TO UPDATE ON THE PLANNED ALLOCATION OF FRIENDS AND HOW THAT CHANGES AND I CAN BE PROVIDED ON A REGULARLY SCHEDULED BASIS OF THE LEGISLATURE KNOWLEDGE WINDOWS UPDATES ARE COMING AND CAN PLAN ITS OVERSIGHT ACTIVITIES AROUND. THE NEW INFORMATION THAT IS PROVIDED. IN ADDITION WE WANT TO PROVIDE SOME OPTIONS TO IMPROVE THE OVERSIGHT OF THE ACTUAL EXPENDITURES SO THE- PATIENT THAT'S REALLY SORT OF YOUR FRONTEND ACCOUNTABILITY OF HOW HIS ADMINISTRATION EXPECT TO USE THE SIGNS. UP REPORTING ON THE ACTUAL EXPENDITURES IS SORT OF MORE OF A BACK IN ACCOUNTABILITY THAT LACKS THE LEGISLATURE- NO HEALTH PLANS ARE ACTUALLY BEING SPENT AND THE PACE OF THERE BEING SACKED- AND WHETHER THAT ALIGNS WITH WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION. HAD INDICATED OR ITS PLANS. I'M SO A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT YOU COULD- REQUEST OR REQUIRE THE ADMINISTRATION TO. REPORTS ON ACTUAL EXPENDITURES THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER AS SOME SORT OF- ROUTINE REPORTING SUCH AS MONTHLY OR QUARTERLY EXPENDITURE REPORTS- EVEN KNOWS THAT SINCE EARLY APRIL THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS REQUIRED ALL STATE AGENCIES TO REPORT ON THEIR CLOTHING NINETEEN RELATED COSTS. AND SO THEY'RE COLLECTING A LOT OF THIS INFORMATION ALREADY AND SO IT IT DOESN'T SEEM UNREASONABLE TO REQUEST THAT THEY SHARE A SUMMARY OF THAT INFORMATION THAT THEY COLLECT ALREADY WITH THE LEGISLATURE. I'M AND WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THESE- EXPENDITURE RECORDS COULD BE COMBINED WITH REPORTING ON THE PLAN ALLOCATION OF FUNDS AS WELL SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS GETTING A COMPLETE PICTURE. I'M ANOTHER APPROACH IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE MONTHLY OR QUARTERLY EXPENDITURE REPORTS. ON YOU COULD HAVE MAYBE A LESS FREQUENT REPORTING SUCH AS HAVING TRIGGERING A REPORT EVERY TEN ADMINISTRATION HITS A CERTAIN THRESHOLD AT THAT LEVEL OF FUNDS SPENT SO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THEY SPENT TWENTY FIVE OR FIFTY OR SEVENTY FIVE. PERCENT OF THE FUNDS. REPORTING OPTIONS THAT I WANTED TO SHARE WE THINK COULD HELP FACILITATE IMPROVED INFORMATION NEEDED FOR OVERSIGHT OF THE RECENTLY PROVIDED. CO IN NINETEEN. NOW WELL IT'S NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE OVERSIGHT OF THESE RECENTLY PROVIDED FRIENDS WE WANT TO SHARE SOME INFORMATION WITH YOU. THAT WE FEEL IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT HAS COME TO OUR ATTENTION DURING OUR REVIEW OF NOT ONLY THE COPING NINETEEN EMERGENCY FUNDING REQUEST BUT ALSO OTHER EMERGENCY FUNDING REQUEST OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. WITH MAJOR WILDFIRES AND CIVIL DISTURBANCE ISSUES. FROM SPECIFICALLY IT'S CONTRARY TENSION THAT THE STATE HAS I'M NUMEROUS AN OVERLAPPING EMERGENCY SPENDING AUTHORITIES THIS IS THROUGH THE- EMERGENCY SERVICES ACTING AS WELL AS STREAMLINED TIME AND DIFFERENT BUDGET PROCESS SEES. THESE VERY EMERGENCY SPENDING AUTHORITIES APPEAR TO CREATE DIFFERENT MECHANISMS OF SPENDING AUTHORITY THAT COULD ALLOW. FOR SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT LEVELS OF TRANSPARENCY AND LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT DEPENDING ON THE DISASTER AND THE AUTHORITY THAT DIMINISHING IN MINISTRATION SHE JUST YEARS IN ANY. GIVEN PARTICULAR EMERGENCY. ARMENIANS AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN AND STATE LAW FOR DECADES AND SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN RARELY USE. SO THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER JUST LOOKING TOWARDS THE FUTURE- TO CONSIDER IN EVALUATING THE EXISTING EMERGENCY SPENDING AUTHORITIES THAT ARE ON THE BOOKS AND CONSIDER SOME MORE BROAD AND LONGER TERM CHANGES. TO HELP FACILITATE OVERSIGHT AND FUTURE EMERGENCY RESPONSES FONG. AND WENT BACK AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS PETERS I HAVE A QUICK QUESTION BEFORE ALL OPENED UP TO- MEMBERS BRIEFLY BEFORE WE THEN HEAR FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND CHIEF FINANCIAL. TO RESPOND TO ELIGIBLE FOR THEIR PRESENTATION I PRE THE VERY. OPTIONS YOU US FOR REPORTING DO YOU HAVE A RECOMMENDATION ON THE FREQUENCY OF REPORTING THAT WE SHOULD ANTICIPATE OR EVEN ASK FOR. I'M A WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION I THINK HE WANTED TO PROVIDE DIFFERENT OPTIONS. THAT YOU COULD CONSIDER IN YOUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. WE WOULD NOTE I THINK AS I SAID BEFORE THE ADMINISTRATION IS COLLECTING EXPENDITURE DATA ON A MONTHLY BASIS AND SO. I AM REQUESTING UPDATES MORE FREQUENTLY THAN THAT PROBABLY WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE- BUT MONTHLY UPDATES AND SEEM LIKE THEY COULD BE REASONABLE. YOU COULD ALSO CONSIDER QUARTERLY UPDATES ALTHOUGH WE WOULDN'T KNOW THAT IT'S BEEN BASS IN THREE MONTHS FROM THE MAY TWENTY FIRST UPDATE TO THE UPDATE THAT WAS POSTED YESTERDAY. AND QUITE A LOT HAS CHANGED IN A HURRY AND SO YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO CONSIDER YOUR COMFORT LEVEL WITH. AND HOW MUCH INFORMATION CAN CHANGE PRETTY RAPIDLY AND BALANCE THAT WITH THE EMAIL THE MINISTRATIONS ABILITY TO SHARE REPORTING INFORMATION. IT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE UP TO DATE INFORMATION THAT HASN'T GONE STALE. AND IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO FACILITATE YOUR OVERSIGHT ACTIVITIES I'M ESPECIALLY AS YOU LOOK IN THE COMING MONTHS IN THE LEGISLATURE IS OUT OF SESSION I'M HAVING THAT ROUTINE INFORMATION OF THE HELPFUL. THANK YOU SENATOR MORE LOT. THANK MADAM CHAIR AND JUSTICE CLEAR EITHER DO QUICK QUESTIONS FOR L. FOR WE HEAR FROM FINANCE OF THE EXACTIONS OF THE PRESENTATION EXACTLY. MISS PETERS WHO SIGNS THE CHECKS. I THE FINES AND YOU WE CAN ASK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES FOR A MORE TECHNICAL ASPECTS RENDERED ARE DISTRIBUTED BY THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE- BY IN TERMS AS- I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO HIGHLIGHT IN OUR PRESENTATION IS THE FLEXIBILITY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS. IN DETERMINING HOW TO ALLOCATE FUNDS TO DEPARTMENTS- AND REALLY AUTHORIZED DEPARTMENTS TO GO FORWARD WITH SPENDING ON IT VARIOUS ACTIVITIES INTERNAL ACTIVITIES OR CONTRACTS. THAT THEY NEED MAYBE PURSUING OKAY THE REASON I ASK IS I COME FROM A COUNTY MODEL WHERE AN AUDITOR CONTROLLER WOULD PROBABLY GIVE SOME PUSH BACK TO US. THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF SPENDING. I DIDN'T SEE THE CONTROLLER MENTIONED ONCE IN YOUR REPORT AND I'M JUST WONDERING. IF ISSUE. JUST SIGNING CHECKS WITHOUT. ANY PUSH BACK OR QUESTIONING AND NO REPORTING IT WHY WHY ISN'T THAT THE CONTROLLER PROVIDING US. A WEEKLY REPORTS OF EXPENDITURES HI. OR OR OR IS THE DEPARTMENT FINANCIAL SIGNING THEIR OWN pKNOW RISK YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT IF AN AUDIT FIRM COMES IN AND- TELLS US WHAT HAPPENED A YEAR OR TWO LATER. I'M WHERE ARE YOU CAN OBVIOUSLY ASK THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE FOR INFORMATION ON THEIR INTERNAL PROCESS THESE- BUT I THINK THE POINT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO HIGHLIGHT IS THAT EXISTING STATE LAW AS WELL AS THAT. AND FLEXIBILITY PROVIDED IN THE BUDGET ALLOWS THE ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE A LOT OF THESE DECISIONS AROUND HOW TO ALLOCATE THE FUNDS. AND YOU KNOW AS THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE IS GOING TO CHECK AND MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S AUTHORIZATION AND THIS IS AN ALLOWABLE EXPENDITURE THERE'S AN APPROPRIATION ATTACHED TO IT- AND SO I GUESS THE POINT WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE IS THAT THERE THERE IS A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY TO THE ADMINISTRATION. TO MAKE THOSE DETERMINATIONS- WHERE THAT THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE WOULD SAY YES THERE'S JUST YOU KNOW. THANKS TO DELIVER IN THE LOT OTHERS AN APPROPRIATE THERE'S MONEY SET ASIDE IN THESE VARIOUS ITEMS- AND SO. YOU KNOW YOU COULDN'T YOU CAN CERTAINLY FOLLOW UP THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE TO ASK MORE ABOUT THEIR SPECIFIC PROCESS BUT AND- YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S. DECISION MAKING AUTHORITY OVER HOW TO SPEND THE FUNDS THEY HAVE A GREAT DEAL FLEXIBILITY UNDER THE LAW. BOETTICHER A LOT OF US VIEW THE CONTROLLER AS A PROTECTOR OF TAXPAYERS THAT'S WHY WE ELECT. A STATE CONTROLLER AND MAYBE IN THE FUTURE WE CAN HAVE THE STATE COMPTROLLER PROVIDE. A REPORT BECAUSE OF THEIR INVOLVEMENT WITH THIS WHOLE PROCESS AND- YOU KNOW JUST SIGNING CHECKS BLINDLY WITHOUT. ASKING QUESTIONS IS A LITTLE DISCONCERTING TO ME SO MAYBE IN THE FUTURE WE COULD INCLUDE HER ON AN AGENDA THANK YOU MADAM I APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTION PERSPECTIVE AND I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO BE CLEAR ABOUT YOU KNOW THE AUTHORITY UNDER THE LAW THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN GIVEN THREE TRAIL AND OTHERS TO EVEN FIGURE OUT IF THE- IF THE CONTROLLER IS ROLE- IT. IS THE SAME IN THESE INSTANCES SO WE PROBABLY NEED TO HAVE SOME CLARIFICATION MAKE-SURE ALL MEMBERS UNDERSTAND AT WHAT POINT THE CONTROLLER SHOULD WEIGH IT OR NOT SO I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION SENATOR NELSON. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. AND I'M- GONNA FIND A PREFACE. WHAT WOULD BE QUESTION TO HELP FINANCE WILL ANSWER ON THEIR OWN COULD YOU PUT A REMARKABLE CULTURE PLEASE SIR. THERE WE GO THAT BETTER YES SIR YES I'M GOING TO PREFACE. QUESTIONS THAT COULD BE POSED TO FINANCE. WITH THEIR PORTION BUT I'D RATHER THAT THEY ADDRESS IT ON THEIR OWN. I AM EXTREMELY ALARMED AT THE AMOUNT OF AUTHORITY THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS CEDED TO THE ADMINISTRATION FOR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF TAXPAYER MONEY IS BEING SPENT. AND WHAT WE'VE NOW DISCERNED FROM THE ANALYST REPORT. IS THE ADMINISTRATION UNILATERALLY HAS CHANGED THE PRIORITIES. AND THERE'S BEEN NO REGULAR REPORTING. TO THE LEGISLATURE. I ARGUE THAT MUST BE REQUIRED SO I'M GOING TO ASK THEN FINANCE TO ADDRESS ONE THEIR TURN AT BAT COMES. WHAT ARE THEY DOING TO GIVE US MORE INFORMATION. AND THE ABILITY OF THE LEGISLATURE TO BATCH IF WE ARE NOT IN ACCORD WITH THE PRIORITIES ESTABLISHED BY THE ADMINISTRATION THIS IS ALMOST AWESOME AND FRIGHTENING THE AMOUNT OF POWER. AND THE AMOUNT OF CHANGES THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION CAN EFFECT OF THROUGH THE AUTHORITIES THAT WE HAVE CEDED TO THEM SO I WOULD LIKE TO THEM AS THEY TALK ABOUT IT WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO PROSPECTIVELY. AND MY- ADMONISHMENT WOULD WE SHOULD BOMB MONTHLY REPORT THEY APPARENTLY ACCORDING TO ANALYSTS ARE GETTING A MONTHLY REPORTS FROM THE AGENCIES THOSE ARE TO BE IMMEDIATELY TENDERED TO THE LEGISLATURE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU SIR CENTER DORADO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. MICHAEL IS WE HAVE- THE L. A. O. HAS IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF WAYS IN WHICH THE LEGISLATURE HAS NOT RECEIVED. ADEQUATE INFORMATION OR COMPLETE INFORMATION. HAVE YOU FOUND ANY. GAP IN THE AUTHORITY. OF THAT THE- ADMINISTRATION HAS. A AS FAR AS OF AN OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION. IS IT TOTALLY WITHIN THEIR AUTHORITY TO NOT PROVIDE THIS IN IT YOU KNOW BECAUSE I KNOW YOU MADE SUGGESTIONS AS TO THE CHANGES NEEDED FOR BETTER OVERSIGHT- AND SPECIFIC IDEAS ON HOW TO DO THAT WITH THESE REPORTS. BUT IS I GUESS MY QUESTION NOW IS. ARE THEY NOT REQUIRED TO DO THAT IS THERE A GAP IN THEIR AUTHORITY. TO DO THAT OR IS IT A 100% WITHIN THEIR AUTHORITY THE ADMINISTRATION'S OF FORTY TO NOT HAVE TO PROVIDE THIS KIND OF INFORMATION. THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION SO V. THERE THERE'S DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS DEPENDING ON THE SOURCE OF THE FUNDING AND I TOUCHED ON A LITTLE BIT IN THE BEGINNING OF OUR PRESENT TO BUT GENERAL SPEAKING MOST OF THESE FUNDS ARE PROVIDED IN A VERY FLEXIBLE MANNER THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE ON ANY SORT OF REPORTING BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE. I HAVE A LOT OF THE FUNDS WERE PROVIDED THROUGH THREE ELAT AND AS I NOTED- THE INITIATION IS REQUIRED TO NOTIFY THEIR GLVC WHEN MONEY IS TRANSFERRED INTO THE THREE- AND THEY WOULD IDENTIFY YOUR BROADLY AND THE TYPES OF THE REASON FOR THAT DAY TRANSFER IN THE TYPES OF THINGS FUNDED. BUT THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT TO NOTIFY THE LEGISLATURE ASSETS FUNDS ACTUALLY GO OUT THE DOOR OR ALLOCATED DEPARTMENT DEPARTMENTS- AND SO A LOT OF THE MONEY HAS BEEN PROVIDED THROUGH JURY OUT WHILE ON THE FUNDS THAT WERE PROVIDED THROUGH SECTION THIRTY SIX DID HAVE A SEVENTY TWO HOUR NOTIFICATION- THAT WAS IN LAST WAS TO FISCAL YEAR THE- ADMINISTRATION DID PROVIDE THOSE NOTIFICATIONS- SO WE'RE NOT SEEING ANY CASE WHERE THERE'S- REQUIRED NOTIFICATIONS OR REPORTING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S FAILING TO DEAL. I THINK IT'S MORE IN THE WAY THE STATE'S EMERGENCY SPENDING AUTHORITIES ARE SAT AT- IT GIVES A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY TO ADMINISTRATION. AND YOU'RE ONE OF THE REASONS IN A TYPICAL EMERGENCY YOU KNOW THE VERSION YOU HAVE A FIRE AND THEN THE FIRE WOULD BE CUT OUT AND THEN THE EMERGENCY WOULD BE OVER AND THEN THERE IT JUST BE SORT OF AFTER THE FACT. RECOVERY OPERATIONS- OF THE COVER NINETEEN EMERGENCY IS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT IN THAT WERE STILL UNDER AN EMERGENCY DECLARATION THAT COULD CONTINUE FOR MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS AND SALAS EVEN IF THE LEGISLATURE HADN'T PROVIDED FLEXIBILITY THROUGH THE BUDGET ADMINISTRATION WOULD HAVE FLEXIBILITY TO THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT- THAT STATUTE WAS PUT INTO EFFECT IN I THINK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY. AND DOESN'T HAVE ANY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ON THAT GOAL WITH IT AND I THINK. IT'S PROBABLY FAIR TO SAY THAT WE HIS WAS IN PLACE. OKAY BEEN IN THAT WE HAVE EMERGED. THAT WOULD GO ON FOR MANY MONTHS EVEN. SUCH AS THE PANDEMIC THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU. A DOCTOR PAN FOLLOWED BY CENTER WORKOUTS SKI. THANK YOU AND I WANT TO THANK THE L. A. O. FOR THEIR PRESENTATION SO I GUESS I MIGHT MY QUESTION IS REGARDING TRAIL- IS THAT- AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU LOOK HISTORICALLY- PRIOR TO CODE WHAT'S THE LONGEST PERIOD OF TIME IN WHICH IN THE MINISTRATIONS BEEN GIVEN PERMISSION YOU MENTIONED THAT LAWS PASSED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY. WHICH IN A MINISTRATION WAS ALLOWED TO USE FUNDS UNDER JAIL AT USE FUNDS UNDER TRAIL US IT WAS THE LONGEST EMERGENCY PERIOD THAT'S EVER HAPPENED AND SECOND OF ALL- HE DID YEAH I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND FLEXIBILITY BUT THERE'S ACCOUNTABILITY SO HISTORICALLY AS WELL HAS THERE BEEN AN ACCOUNTING NGUYEN IN A MINISTRATION USES FUNDS FOR JAIL AND EVENTUAL ACCOUNTING OF HOW THAT MONEY WAS EVENTUALLY SPENT I UNDERSTAND AT THE MOMENT THEY HAVE TO MAKE QUICK DECISIONS WE WANNA GIVE FLEXIBILITY. HAS THAT BEEN SOMETHING THAT'S HAPPENED HISTORICALLY OR NOT IN TERMS OF FUNDS THAT WERE SPENT UNDER DRILLED UNDER OTHER EMERGENCIES OR IS IT A AN EVENTUAL FINAL ACCOUNTING FOR HOW THOSE FUNDS ARE SPENT OR DID THAT SIMPLY HAPPEN AND- NOTHING EVER HAPPENED THERE WAS NEVER EVER A REPORT THE LEGISLATURE ANY OTHER SORT OF PORT ACCOUNTING FOR HOW THE MONIES WERE EVENTUALLY SPENT. FOR THAT EMERGENCY SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE HISTORIC OF THE HISTORY OF ISRAEL. AND IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. R. AND LET ME. CLEAR IT SENATORS. AND SO. THREE WHAT ADMINISTRATION CAN CONTINUE TO SPEND ON THE SORT OF AFTERMATH AND- RECOVERY OF AN EMERGENCY. EVEN AFTER THE EMERGENCY DECLARATION HAS ENDED. ONCE EMERGENCY DECLARATION HAS ENDED SOME OF THE AUTHORITIES JUST BEHIND I'M SUCH AS THOSE PROVIDED UNDER THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT- WHICH IS SEPARATE FROM THAT RELY STATUTE. THOSE GO AWAY AND SO IT REALLY DOES PROVIDE AN INITIATIVE CONTEMPLATED TO PROVIDE FOR THIS I'M GOING FUNDING HE- AFTER EMERGING. DECLARATION HAS ENDED WE I DON'T HAVE OFF HAND BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY LOOK INTO. AND THE LONGEST DURATION OF A OF A DECLARED EMERGENCY- AS WELL AS- THE USE OF THREE- I FRIENDS AND- THE THREE OTHER STATUTE MAKES THAT THIS. FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS. KIND OF. TRYING TO SAY WELL ABOUT HALF THE YEAR SO THAT ADDITIONAL BEYOND THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED TO THE STATE'S REGULAR BUDGET PROCESS- BUT THAT THE STATUTE DOES ALLOW FOR THE HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS TO BE EXTENDED. I'M IN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED TWENTY DAY INCREMENTS OF THE SPENDING CAN GO ON FOR QUITE AWHILE. I'M PRIOR TO THAT THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WITH A MAJOR FIRES IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN% TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE STATE HAD NOT USED THE TRIO IT STATUTE VERY MUCH- FOR PRETTY SMALL AMOUNTS. AND SO I THINK IN RECENT TIMES THE LONGEST STANDING YOU SURGERY A LOT WOULD BE LOOKING AT THE DEBRIS REMOVAL AND ONGOING RECOVERY OPERATIONS FROM THE MAJOR FIRES IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN. I'M AWARE THAT HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAY AUTHORIZATION WAS EXTENDED. I'M IN TERMS OF THE INFORMATION THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS RECEIVING ON THE BACK END OF WHAT ALTERNATELY HAPPENED. AS I NOTED BEFORE IT'S INCONSISTENT- SO IN SOME CASES ADMINISTRATION HAS PROVIDED I'M SOME GOOD INFORMATION ON A PARTICULAR RESPONDING TO THE MAJOR FIRES IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN. ADMINISTRATION ADDED SOME DOCUMENTS TO ITS BUDGET DISPLAYS- I'M DETAILING OUT HOW THE FUNDS WERE ALLOCATED- TO VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS FOR A DIFFERENT RESPONSE AND RECOVERY ACTIVITIES- FOR THOSE FIRES. IN OTHER CASES THE ACTUAL ALLOCATION EXPENDITURE OF DRILL OF FRIENDS HAVEN'T HAD ANY- YOU KNOW ADDITIONAL BACK AND ACCOUNTING- THAT'S REPORTED TO THE LEGISLATURE CELL IT YOU KNOW SOME KEY. ARE HAS PROVIDED IN SOME CASES NOT- BUT THE LOCK ITSELF DOESN'T REQUIRE THAT BACK AND REPORTING. SORRY THE JUST ONE OTHER VIEW QUESTION GIVEN THE FACT THAT TRAIL NOT YOU FOR THE- OF THIS. IS A TIME TO UPDATE THE TRAIL A LOT. TO ENSURE THIS IN THE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE FLEXIBILITY THIS EMERGENCY FUND BUT THAT. DESERT SOMETHING DAILY I WOULD RECOMMEND. YEAH SO I THINK CAN IS TO OUR LAST ISSUE FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION TODAY IS STEPPING BACK EVEN FROM THE TIME THAT THE SPECIFIC FUNDS AND SET ASIDE TO RESPOND TO THE CALL THE NINETEEN EMERGENCY. IN OUR REVIEW I HAVE HAD TO COPE WITH FINDING RECENT WILDFIRE FUNDING I'M- FUNDING FOR THE CIVIL DISTURBANCE AND THAT WAS IN A DECLARED EMERGENCY. AND IT'S REALLY COME TO OUR ATTENTION THAT THERE IS NOT ONLY TO RIO AT HAS. SOME SHORTCOMINGS PERHAPS IN TERMS OF. THE LEGISLATURE'S ABILITY TO HAVE A PROGRAM FOR MISSION AND FACILITATE THAT TRANSPARENCY AND LEGISLATIVE INVOLVEMENT BUT THE THESE OTHER STATURE. AND OTHER PROVISIONS ALLOW FOR EMERGENCY SPENDING AUTHORITIES. AND. AND SO REALLY WE THINK IT SHOULD BE I. LOOK AT THEM TO GET. AND I WOULD YOU KNOW. THAT IF THEY MINISTRY HAVING. REAL AT TAX. THE FUNDS FOR THE CODE NINETEEN EMERGENCY THEY COULD HAVE USED. A DIFFERENT SPENDING AUTHORITY UNDER THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT THAT HAS NO RECORDING AND SO AND YOU KNOW IT'S AND THE LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY IN REPORTING UNDER EACH OF THESE DIFFERENT SPENDING AUTHORITIES. IT NECESSARILY YOU KNOW TIED TO THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT THINK IT WOULD BE OR SHOULD BE SUCH AS THE URGENCY OF FINDING AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE'RE ASKING. I HAVE EVER CERTAINLY CONTINUING TO LOOK INTO THIS AND WE THINK YOU KNOW CERTAINLY LOOKING AT TRIO AND THE AUTHORITY PROVIDED THERE- BUT ALSO TAKING OUT RYDER LUCK AND TO THE EXTENT THAT. THE CODE NINETEEN EMERGENCY OR OTHER FUTURE EMERGENCIES COULD STAY UNDER THAT DISASTER DECLARATION FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME AND YOU REALLY WANT TO HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE LOCK AND- BUT YOU KNOW IT WELL IT DOESN'T DIRECTLY RELATE TO THAT AND SO YOU PROVIDED. IN THIS YEAR TO THE MINISTRATION. BUT WHAT. AS ATTENTION THAT THE REAL ARE OVER IN INCOME EMERGE SPEND AUTHORITY THAT PROVIDE FOR DEGREES OF TRANSFER IN OVER PROBABLY ALL OF YOU AT THE ARE IN GIVEN THE SCALE AND MAGNITUDE OF THE FUNDING ON TO IN RECENT YEARS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MUST BE MEMBERS I'M GONNA ASK YOU TO ASK YOUR ONE MOST PRESSING QUESTION OF THE L. L. THIS ISN'T OUR ONLY OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE THE L. A. L. ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE. BUT I AM- MANAGING OUR TIME TODAY I'VE GOT SENATOR WHITE CAL SKI FOLLOWED BY SKINNER CENTER LEYVA WITH YOUR HAND RATES FOR THE TESTER DO YOU STILL HAVE A QUESTION. HE THOUGHT HE SAW THE QUESTION AND FOLLOWED BY SEVEN TO REQUIRE Y. CASKEY I THINK CENTER NIELSEN MAKES A GOOD POINT N. CENTER PAN TALKING ABOUT. OKAY I GET IT IN MAY TWENTY FIRST WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY REQUIRE TECHNICALLY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO GIVE US UPDATES I UNDERSTAND THAT FOR YOU LET TECHNICALLY DOESN'T UNDER REQUIRE THEM TO GIVE US UPDATES AT AGE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE EMERGENCY SERVICES. TECHNICALLY DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT WE PAY THEY HAVE TO GIVE US UPDATES OKAY THAT'S ALL CLEAR IS THERE ANYTHING THAT PROHIBITED THEM WITH- ANYTHING INTERNAL LAW OR IN THE AUTHORIZATION THAT DEEP PROHIBITED FROM GIVING US BASIC INFORMATION WHEN THE- WHOLE. HOTEL AND HEALTH CARE WORKERS CHANGE FROM THIRTY MILLION TO FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE BILLION ASSERT ANYTHING IN THIS BODY OF LAW THAT PROHIBIT THEM FROM GIVING US A NOTE. AND A HEADS UP OF THESE THINGS HAD SUBSTANTIALLY CHANGED THIS ONE LITTLE BIT OF LAW. THAT THEY COULD HAVE PAINTED ON. I ARE ASKING THEIR THERE'S NOT THAT FOR THEM IN. FROM PROVIDE THIS OF. AND WE WOULD KNOW THE ARE. AS WELL AS OTHER LEGISLATIVE STAFF HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR. I'M WEEKS AND EVEN MONTHS FOR UPDATED INFORMATION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON ITS PLANNED SPENDING ON AN ACTUAL EXPENDITURES. AND TIME UP UNTIL THE INFORMATION THAT WAS POSTED LATE YESTERDAY. AND THE RESPONSE WAS ALWAYS THAT THE NAY TWENTY FIRST A LETTER TO THE G. L. B. C. WAS THE MOST. CURRENT INFORMATION AVAILABLE- AND SO CERTAINLY AS A LEGISLATURE IS PROVIDED. I HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF FLEXIBILITY IN THE MEASURE SHE HAS A GREAT DEAL FLEXIBILITY TO RESPOND HERE RIGHTLY SO AS THE SITUATION CONTINUES TO UNFOLD WITH EMERGENCY. WE THINK IT'S ALSO VERY REASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT THE MINISTRATION WAITED PROVIDE EITHER OF ITS OWN ACCORD OR HAS ANY SORT OF INFORMAL REQUEST OR IF YOU FORMALLY REQUIRING TEAMS. TO PROVIDE THIS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO KEEP THE LEGISLATURE IN THE LOOP ESPECIALLY TO THE EXTENT THAT MANY OF THAT THE EXPENDITURES HAPPENING HERE. ARE BEING PLANNED OUT DAYS OR WEEKS OR MONTHS AHEAD OF TIME WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN A SITUATION WHERE. THERE'S HELLFIRE IN. HIS JUST GO AND PUT IT OUT AND YOU KNOW NOT REALLY PLANNING WHAT YOU'RE OR HOW DOING. ON INTO THE SUMMER-DEBATE DIFFERENT SO WE DO THINK IT'S VERY REASONABLE FOR THAT THE LEGISLATURE TO EXPECT THAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THANK THANK YOU WAS SPEAKERS MY SKINNER. THANK YOU CARE AND- GIVEN THAT WE ARE THE SELL OUT GIVEN THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE OUT OF SESSION. AUGUST THIRTY FIRST. HI MY UNDERSTANDING IS WE THE ONLY WAY WE COULD COME BACK. TO ACT BEFORE OUR REGULAR SESSION STARTS AGAIN. IN OF. OF DECEMBER I GUESS. WOULD BE THROUGH A GOVERNOR ACTION. FIRST L. A. O. JUST CORRECT ME ON THAT. LET ME KNOW IF I'M ACCURATE IN THAT. AND THAT WE CAN GET BACK TO YOU IF THERE'S ANY OTHER OPTIONS BUT I THINK AT CERTAINLY THROUGHOUT LIKE I HAD A SPECIAL SESSION CALLING OF A SPECIAL SESSION AND I WOULD HAVE TO BE THE GOVERNOR. AND HOW THAT WOULD BE THE TYPICAL WAY THAT THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT SO AND SO THEN IF WE ASSUME THAT WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ACT IN THAT INTERIM PERIOD WE'D IF WE WANTED TO FOLLOW UP. ENACT SOMETHING CLOSE TO YOUR RECOMMENDATION ON THE- LAST PAGE ABOUT. FINANCIALLY REVISING THE EXISTING STATUTES WE'D HAVE TO DO THAT BY AUGUST THIRTY FIRST. PRACTICE BY AUGUST THIRTY FIRST RIGHT TO THE MY LAST COMMENT IS I THINK THAT'S WORTH OUR CONSIDERATION OKAY AND SECONDARILY ON PAGE SEVEN OF THE L. A. O.'S REPORT WHERE THEY MENTION WRITTEN NOTIFICATION WHERE THEY MENTIONED IT'S AT SIX AND SEVEN WERE THERE IS RECOMMENDED- TWO DIFFERENT WAYS. THAT WE MIGHT- GET A IMPROVED OVERSIGHT ONE OF THEM IS MEMBER BRIEFINGS AND THE OTHERS WRITTEN NOTIFICATION I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT WE OPT FOR OF COURSE WE CAN ALWAYS HAVE MEMBER BRIEFINGS BUT I THINK WE SHOULD REQUIRE THE REGULAR WRITTEN NOTIFICATION AND SECONDARILY WE SHOULD ASK FOR THE MONTHLY EXPENDITURE REPORTS. THANK YOU SENATOR LEYVA. THANK YOU MADAM BUDGET CHAIR I HAVE A QUESTION ON PAGE FOUR OF YOUR REPORT ON THE ONE POINT ONE BILLION ON STATE RESPONSE OPERATIONS THE INCREASE OF NINE HUNDRED MILLION MORE. DO WE KNOW WHAT THE RESPONSE OPERATIONS ARE IS THAT TESTING IS A CONTACT TRACING WHAT IS IT THAT MONEY BEING USED FOR. AND SO I THINK THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO EXPLAIN THE DETAILS. RIGHT I DON'T BELIEVE IT WOULD INCLUDING TESTING AND CONTACT TRACING BACK THE SEPARATE CATEGORY MS I'M NOT SURE IF YOU GUYS RECEIVED A HARD COPY OF OUR HAND OUT BUT HI CHART BUT I SHOWED. DURING THE PRESENTATION HAD THESE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES THIS PROCUREMENT CASTING AND THE STATE OPERATIONS RESPONSIBLE I AND MY UNDERSTANDING OF IT IS IT'S MORE AT THE STATE SORT OF ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS BUT I THINK THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION FOR A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ONLINE. WHAT THEY PLAN TO SPEND THOSE FUNDS ON AND WHY IT'S GOING TO. SHOW CENTROLEGAL COME TO YOU FIRST AFTER FINANCE PRESENTS FOR YOU TO POSE THAT QUESTION TO THEM. THANK YOU SIX WIRED. THIRTY THANK YOU SO MUCH AT NIGHT OF CHAIR. COMMITTEE JUST COURT COMMENT NOW CHAIR IN LIGHT OF THIS. ONGOING PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY IT WOULD MAKE SENSE AT LEAST TO ME IT SOUNDS LIKE FOR MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES. TO REVIEW BLOGGER TURNED THE DERAIL THAT STATUTE AND OTHER. EMERGENCY SPENDING MEASURES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION CURRENTLY HAS I THINK- PRIOR TO THIS PANDEMIC. THE REAR WITH MAKE A WHILE AND FIRES IS THE REAL ONE HERE IN LARGE. EMERGENCY RESPONSE INITIATIVES ARE NOW PART OF OUR IT LIFE WHETHER IT'S- LARGE WHILE FIRES FLOODS GOD FORBID A LARGE EARTHQUAKE. AND THIS ON GOING PANDEMIC SO I KNOW THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN IMPORTANT ONE FOR OUR BUDGET SHARING GRATEFUL FOR HER WORK ON THIS AND THAT AND BUDGET SHARE JUST A SUGGESTION THAT. IF WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT OVERSIGHT- AS WE MOVE FORWARD HERE INTO THE FALL THAT THIS COULD BE A POTENTIAL SUBJECT. IN HOW WE COULD BRING ADDITIONAL VOICE FROM THE LEGISLATURE INTO THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU WERE GOING TO MOVE ON TO THE PRESENTATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THREE SAID CALVERT ASSISTED PROGRAM BUDGET MANAGER. MISS CALVERT I HOPE THAT YOU ARE HEARD CENTER NIELSEN'S QUESTION AND ARE PREPARED TO INCORPORATE A RESPONSE TO HIM INTO YOUR INITIAL PRESENTATION AND THEN AFTER YOU PRESENT WILL HAVE MEMBERS POSE QUESTIONS. MISS CALVERT THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THAT MORNING AT. OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YES SIR THAT FOR THE JUST AND WILL PRESENTATIONS YOUR I'M HERE ALSO WASTE VENTURE WHO HELP ON SOME OF THIS AND QUESTION AS WE MOVE FORWARD BUT I WILL TRY TO KEEP MY OVERVIEW BRIEF TO A LOT OF. TIME FOR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I'M AT WAS NOTED IT THAT WOULD YOU OFFICE. DEPARTMENT DURATION OUR BEST OF DISPLACEMENT AT THE TIME THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN TAKE TO WORK THE STATE EACH ARE SO TO CRISIS SECOND TO RUN YES. AND IN EFFORTS TO TRANSFER FROM AN UPDATE YOU KNOW SO THE BUDGET I WE AGAIN. RELEASED I KNOW IN FOR ESTHER. THAT WE HOPE HELPS PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DETAILS. IN VARIOUS PROGRAM CATEGORIES. MOVING FORWARD AND I HOPE THIS GETS TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE EARLIER MOVING FORWARD IT IS OUR INTENT TO PROVIDE A MONTHLY UPDATE ON EXPENDITURE ESTIMATES- SO THAT THAT HELPS REPORT OUT ON A REGULAR BASIS ON THIS PROGRAM CATEGORIES AND THE EFFORTS BEING MADE- AS WERE IN. IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PANDEMIC. AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL THIS UP WHAT WE ISSUE YESTERDAY- AT AND SINCE THE BUDGET ACT FOR THAT COMBINATION OF PAST YEAR IS WHAT YOUR KNIGHT TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND THE- CURRENT FISCAL YEAR TWENTY. TWENTY ONE WE ARE ESTIMATING THAT OUR TEACHERS ARE TRACKING ABOUT ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS LOWER THAN. PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED- OF THAT AMOUNT ABOUT THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION. IT WOULD BE GENERAL FUND DEBT DECREASES AND YOU GET TO REITERATE OUR POINT IN TIME ESTIMATES CONTINUE TO APPLY YOU KNOW. PANDEMIC CONTINUES TO EVOLVE AND THINGS ARE DEFINITELY SUBJECT TO CHANGE BUT THOSE REDUCTIONS. LARGELY ATTRIBUTED TO LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED PREVIOUSLY JUST. THIS IS A RESULT OF SOME OF MY COSTS THE CREATION AND ALSO SOME CONTRACTS NOT COMING TO FRUITION WE CANCELED IT WAS ALSO A PRETTY BIG. AND THE MEDICAL SURGE HOSPICE OPTIONS FOR THE PAST YEAR. THE NINETEEN TWENTY THERE'S CONSTANT MATERIALIZE AS PREVIOUSLY. ESTIMATED TIME IN ADDITION THERE'S BEEN A COUPLE OF ACTIVITIES THAT WORK I AM KNOWN WHEN WE HAD OUR MAY TWENTY FIRST CHARTS AND ESTIMATES YOU HAVE HEARD PUBLICLY OUT OF THAT FUNDING FOR THE HARVEST PROGRAM WRITING CHILDREN'S SERVICES WITHIN THEIR CULTURAL INDUSTRY WHO HAVE BECOME EXPOSED TO COVER NINETEEN AND- NOT SELF RESULT. RESULT ISOLATE AND THERE'S ALSO THE PROJECT HOPE PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES CHILDREN SERVICES. TO FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS. EXPOSE PRIOR TO RELEASE. I GUESS ONE THREE. THAT INTENDS TO PROVIDE MONTHLY REPORTING I THINK THAT GETS YOU. A FEW OF THE QUESTIONS NOTED- ON THE NOTION OF BREAKING SPEAKING WITH. OUR PARTNERS AT- YES AND YOU JUST AGENCY ALWAYS AN OPENNESS TO PROVIDE. MEANS AND BALANCING THAT WITH YOU KNOW RELIEF FOR THE SAME ENTITIES RESPONDING TO THE CRISIS AT AS IT UNFOLDS. AND WORKED WITH THAT WERE YOU KNOW HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE AND WE CAN ALSO DISPLAY. THAT CHART THAT WE PUT OUT. YESTERDAY THAT HASN'T. HIGH LEVEL TO LOOK AT TO THE COMMITTEE AND THEN SHE SENATOR LAST QUESTION POSED ABOUT THAT STATE RESPONSE COST YES STATE RESPONSE OPERATIONS LARGELY IS THOSE THINGS THAT ARE- ATTRIBUTED THIS. STATE DEPARTMENTS AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND RESPONSE TO THE CRISIS IN OUR CHURCH THAT WE ISSUED YESTERDAY. THOSE. THAT WE PULLED OUT FOR. DETAILS CAN THAT KIND OF WHERE. WE SEE OUR GUARD AND STATE HOSPITALS THAT KIND OF GIVES A SENSE OF THE INTERVIEWS OF COURSE- YES JUST AGENTS OF COURSE. THAT'S THAT'S THAT KIND AGAIN WITH THAT WE HAVE EIGHTEEN FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. A LITTLE. TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND- I WITHOUT. IN ADDITION. THANK YOU QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS SENATOR MONNING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- AND I APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I DID HAVE A QUESTION ON THE HOUSING FOR THE HARVEST. IN ESTIMATE OF FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS DO YOU KNOW CURRENTLY HOW MUCH OF THAT HAS BEEN DISTRIBUTED IN THROUGH THROUGH QUITE AGENCY OR DEPARTMENTS IS THAT FUND BEING ADMINISTERED. YES SO AND TO MY KNOWLEDGE I DON'T KNOW THAT ANY OF THAT HAS BEEN DISTRIBUTED YET THE PROGRAM IS FAIRLY NEW AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE IS LEAD ON THIS PROJECT THEY'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES TO HELP. WITH THAT PROCUREMENT OF THE HOTELS- AND SO THOSE PERMITTED OF AGRICULTURE IS THE LEAD AGENCY. AND. FINDING WORK FLOW. I BELIEVE EITHER TARGETING AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT SERVICES WITH MY KNOWLEDGE NONE OF THAT HAS BEEN ALLOCATED YET. RIGHT NOW IT'S RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THAT. OUR INTEREST I THINK MY INTEREST WOULD BE THE- EXPEDITIOUS DISTRIBUTION- WE KNOW IN MANY RURAL COMMUNITIES THE HIGHEST RATE OF CODE NINETEEN IS AMONG. FARMWORKER COMMUNITIES- AND- I WOULD HAVE HOPED THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATED. DIRECTED EARLIER BUT- WE WILL FOLLOW UP WITH DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE AND- MAYBE THROUGH THE CHAIR WE CAN REQUEST SOME FURTHER INFORMATION ON THAT EMERGENCY FUNDING SOURCE. I'D ALSO BE CURIOUS TO SEE. WHAT THAT AMOUNT WAS BASED UPON WHAT'S THE ESTIMATE OF WHAT WILL BE ACHIEVED WITH IT AND WILL IT MEET THE NEED ANTICIPATED- I'D ALSO LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT- WORKING WITH CDFA- THE ANTICIPATED NEED IN WILL THAT BE SUFFICIENT. AND THEN ALSO IN THE AREA OF. VULNERABLE POPULATIONS FIFTEEN MILLION IDENTIFIED FOR FOOD BANKS DO YOU KNOW IF THAT HAS BEEN DONE. SOME AND THROUGH QUITE AGENCY OR DEPARTMENT IS THE SUPPORT FOR FOOD BANKS BEING MANAGED. YES I DO- I BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT FOR THAT EFFORT. IS THE TIME TO SOCIAL SERVICES I WILL NEED TO TURN THAT OVER TO MY COUNTERPART HERE AT FINANCE- I'M DOOR TO SEE IF HE HAS A SENSE OF HOW MUCH. ADMINISTRATOR IF THAT'S ANOTHER FOLLOW UP THAT WILL WELL. SENATOR MONEY GREAT THANK YOU. IN THE IS THAT AVAILABLE NOW. HI THIS IS ADAM DIVERSITY AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- YES SO- THAT IS THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES THAT IS IT MINISTERING THAT PROGRAM AND IT'S- YOU KNOW PART OF A SERIES OF INVESTMENTS MADE IN FOOD BANK- AND SO- LET ME I'VE KIND OF UP IN SEE IF THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN DISTRIBUTED ALREADY. THANK YOU IN I THINK ONE THING THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO US ON MANY OF THESE. ALLOCATIONS FOR VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. THEY WERE BASED ON WHAT PROJECTED TIME OF NEED AND AS THE COVERT VIRUS CONTINUES TO SPREAD IN CALIFORNIA IN NATIONALLY. I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO KNOW ARE THESE ALLOCATIONS ANTICIPATING SUPPORT FOR THREE MONTHS OR SIX MONTHS AND IT AND IF THEY NEED TO BE REPLENISHED OR IF THEY'RE EXHAUSTED- I THINK WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT SOONER RATHER THAN LATER AS PART OF OUR EFFORTS. TO PLAN FORWARD IN TERMS OF FUTURE ALLOCATIONS OR FURTHER APPEALS TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- WE KNOW WE'RE IN A HUGE GAP RIGHT NOW FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SUPPORT. THAT IS AFFECTING LOW INCOME AND VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES WHO ARE NOW FACING RENT. BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN CARRIED. BUT NOW WE'RE COMING DUE THE CRISIS IT BUILDS AND PART OF IT IS THE IMMEDIATE HEALTH PANDEMIC CRISIS BUT IT'S TRIGGERING THESE OTHER SOCIAL IMPACTS THAT- I THINK IT WOULD BE IN OUR INTEREST TO BE KEPT. INFORMED ABOUT ANTICIPATED DEPLETION OF ALLOCATED MONIES AND HOW THEY ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED ALLOCATED AND LET'S GET AHEAD OF THE CURVE ON THE NEED FOR CONSIDERING- FURTHER ALLOCATIONS- SO I APPRECIATE ANY FURTHER INFORMATION THAT MIGHT BE PROVIDED TO US. OVER THE NEXT WEEK OR SO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU SIR US INTO MORE LAW. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- BEING ACCOUNT NUMBERS ARE NUMBERS BUT THERE'S A NARRATIVE THAT TELLS. APPS A DIFFERENT STORY AND HERE WE ARE FOUR MONTHS INTO THIS. PANDEMIC AND THE INITIAL FOCUS WAS ON A MASSIVE SURGE- THAT DID NOT OCCUR- SO WE HAD A MASSIVE OVERSHOOT FROM THE INCEPTION WE HAD A BOAT IN ARENA AN EMPTY LOS ANGELES HOSPITAL. VERSUS PROGRESSIVELY WORKING WITH ERIC EXCESS PROPERTIES LIKE FACILITIES LIKE FAIRVIEW'S SONOMA PORTER VILLE- BUT WE SHUT DOWN HOSPITALS AND MEDICAL PRACTICES. AS A POSTER RAMPING UP BUT I'M I'M JUST CURIOUS- MADAM CHAIR WHEN WE RECEIVE NOT ONLY THE NUMBERS BUT WHEN WILL WE RECEIVE THE NARROW OF WHY CERTAIN DECISIONS WERE MADE. AT AND- WHY DO WE DO CERTAIN THINGS THAT NEVER MATERIALIZED OUT WHAT DATA WHAT SCIENCE. I WOULD LOVE TO BUY THE BOOK AND MAYBE THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE TO MAYBE GIVE A LITTLE. TEASER OF WHAT WHAT ARE WE WOULD THAT BE READING THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO THAT RHETORICAL ARE YOU LOOKING FOR A RESPONSE FROM FINANCE. IF THERESA COVERED HAS ANY CAN'T COMMENT I'D LOVE TO HEAR IT THREE MISS CALVERT. YES THANK AND YEAH ON THE SURGE AGAIN THOSE ESTIMATES FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY WERE HIGHER THAN WHAT ACTUALLY MATERIALIZES- I HAVE A COLLEAGUE MARCO BEACH FROM HHS AGENCY. ON AS WELL HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT. WHAT THAT WHAT THAT MEANT AND HOW THAT. CAME ABOUT AS BEING LOWER LOWER COST OF THE DIDN'T MATERIALIZE AS AS FEARS. AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE WITH YOU AND SENATOR I THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION IN PARTICULAR BUT WITH REGARDS TO THAT THE MEDICAL SEARCH FACILITIES. WE ACTUALLY DID TAKE ADVANTAGE AND WE CONTINUE TO HAVE OUR MD DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS AS ALTERNATE CARE SITES WE IN FACT TOWN FAIR VIEW AND PORTABLE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS BOTH- ACTIVATED AND ARE USING THEM. WE ARE VERY FORTUNATE IN CALIFORNIA WE PLAN FOR THE WORST CASE SCENARIO AND- FORTUNATELY ENOUGH WE WERE ABLE TO MANAGE THE- THIS INCREASED AND- HOSPITALIZATIONS AND THE NEED FOR INDIVIDUALS TO HOSPITALIZED WITHIN THEIR EXISTING HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. AND THAT IS ULTIMATELY THE BEST PLACE FOR US TO BE TREATING INDIVIDUALS. AND AS A RESULT WE DID NOT FORTUNATELY NOT HAD TO USE AT THE ADDITIONAL MED SURGE WITH BODIES THAT WE HAD. MADE AVAILABLE OR BUILD OUT IN THE EARLY STAGES. OF THIS AND DEMOCRATS ARE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK PAN. I THANK YOU A MAN CHAIR AND MAYBE FIRST MY REMARKS BY SAYING THAT- I DO APPRECIATE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION- PREPARED US FOR A POTENTIAL- SEARCH AND- THE CHALLENGE PUBLIC HEALTH IS THAT WHEN IT DOESN'T HAPPEN SOMETIMES YOU DON'T GIVE CREDIT TO THE FACT THAT WE WORK TO MAKE NOT MAKE THAT HAPPENED LET'S THIS WAY I PREFERRED THAT WE PUT THE MONEY UP AND WE END UP NOT HAVING TO USE IT AND EVEN WHEN I CONSIDER THAT WASTE OR NOT. THEN ACTUALLY NOT HAVING DONE IT AND HAVE INSTEAD PAID WITH LIVES SO I JUST HAVE TO START WITH THAT- WHEN IT COMES TO THIS SPENDING AGAIN YOU KNOW HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY AND SO FORTH AND SOME OF THE CHALLENGES FOR EXAMPLE I'M LOOKING AT THE CHART FROM FINANCE- COVE IN NINETEEN TO DIRECT RESPONSE COST ESTIMATES Q. MILLER TOTAL EXPENDITURES. AND THE CHALLENGE WE DON'T HAVE DETAILS IS THAT. YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE ONLY SPENDING 6% ARE ACTUALLY WELL IF YOU LOOK AT THE AUGUST TOTAL WE LOOK AT THE- AUGUST TOTAL WHICH WOULD ACTUALLY REPRESENT THE ACTUAL SPENDING VERSUS THE ESTIMATE WELL HE SPENT SEVEN POINT 2% ON STATEWIDE TESTING AND ONLY TWO POINT 4% ON CONTACT TRACING THE TWO THINGS THAT WE SHOULD MAKE THE TOP PRIORITY. IN ORDER CONTROL THIS PANDEMIC THAT'S KEEPING OUR BUSINESS IS CLOSE OUR SCHOOLS CLOSED NOW I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S THE RIGHT AMOUNT BECAUSE I DON'T JUST DUMP MONEY INTO SOMETHING THAT CAN ABSORB IT- BUT I GUESS THIS IS WHY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE HAVE THIS KIND OF TRANSPARENCY COULD BE THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF MONEY RIGHT I MEAN I'M NOT DISPUTING THE FACT THAT WE'RE SPENDING MONEY. ON OTHER THINGS IN FOR EXAMPLE THE PROCUREMENT WAS NO TO P. THE WOULD ACTUALLY FOR TESTING COURSE THAT DOESN'T FALL UNDER TESTING CATEGORY SO I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THERE'S A MORE DETAILED EXPLANATION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION OTHERWISE WHAT HAPPENS IS I'M LEFT OF THE CHART LIKE THIS AND I COULD CERTAINLY CRITICIZED ADMINISTRATION FOR UNDER SPENDING IN PUBLIC HEALTH. THE AT PERCENTAGES. SO THAT'S WHY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ACCIDENTAL HOW MUCH MONEY IS GOING TO OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. HOW MUCH MONEY ARE WE REALLY SPENDING. ON TESTING OUT IN THE COMMUNITY I KNOW THAT- SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE LACK OF TESTING AVAILABILITY RIGHT IS THIS SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS- THESE ARE TYPES OF QUESTIONS THAT. WE DO NEED THE ADMINISTRATION TO HELP EXPLAIN. BECAUSE OTHERWISE WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT PEOPLE DROP PERHAPS INAPPROPRIATE CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE PRIORITIES AND THE STRATEGY OF THE ADMINISTRATION. SO I JUST. YOU KNOW SO I I'D REALLY DO WANT EARNERS ADMINISTRATION TO THINK CAREFULLY. ABOUT THE NEED FOR EXPLANATIONS AND FULL DISCLOSURES OF. HOW MONEY IS BEING SPENT. NOT JUST BECAUSE WE'RE ASKING IS BECAUSE ON FORTY PEOPLE CAN DRAW. POTENTIALLY INAPPROPRIATE CONCLUSIONS. AND SO I WOULD JUST MAKE NOTE AND IS I'M DOING JUST A QUICK YOU KNOW CALCULATION OF. THESE EXPENDITURES. AND CERTAINLY I AM YOU KNOW. THAT YOU KNOW THESE TO ME THESE TWO ARE THE TOP PRIORITIES FOR TRYING TO CONTROL THIS PANDEMIC THAT UNDERLIES OUR UNEMPLOYMENT. THAT UNDERLIES OUR SCHOOL CLOSURES THAT UNDERLIES OUR BUSINESS IS BEING CLOSED. AND YET THERE ARE ONLY A FRACTION OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT. AND WHY IT AND SO BE ABLE TO HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING AS TO WHY WE'RE SPENDING EXACTLY HOW MUCH. FOR DIFFERENT THINGS IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO BETTER COMMUNICATE TO THE- THAT WE HAVE OUR PRIORITIES STRAIGHT. AND I DON'T NOBODY WANNA RESPOND TO THAT FINANCE OR A PERHAPS WE CANNOT FOLLOW UP LATER ON THIS THANK YOU. THIS CALVERT. YES I DON'T HAVE YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE A DIRECT RESPONSE TO THAT BUT THIS IS PART OF THE DISCUSSION THAT COMES AS WE KIND OF REPORT OUT MORE. REGULARLY AND AS I NOTED PLANNED ON A MONTHLY BASIS TO KIND OF HAVE THAT ALONG WITH. THAT MEMBER BRIEFINGS THAT WERE MENTIONED EARLIER- I MIGHT ALSO TURN IT OVER TO MARCO BEACH AGAIN. AT THE HHS AGENCY JUST TO TALK ABOUT THE TESTING OUT AND- TO GIVE A LITTLE MORE IN. ON HE- AS WELL HEARING. THANK YOU TO RESEND DR PAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR QUESTION I THINK YOU ALLUDED TO. AS SOMETHING THAT WE OFTEN THINK ABOUT IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH SPACE WHICH IS AYE WE BOX IN THE VIRUS AND WE BOX IN THE VIRUS REALLY BY. LOOKING AT A FEW THINGS THAT INCLUDES BOTH TESTING CONTACT TRACING AND WEBER THE INFORMATION THAT WAS PUT OUT BY. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE INCLUDES THE GENERAL FUND CONTRIBUTIONS THE STATE IS MAKING. NOT NECESSARILY THE TOTAL FUNDS INCLUDING THAT FEDERAL DOLLARS THAT WE RECEIVED FROM. THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION AND AS YOU KNOW WE PUSHED OUT RECENTLY TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. FOR A LOCAL PARTNERS RECENTLY AND THAT FEDERAL EAT WHAT WE CALL E. L. C. DOLLARS THAT IS TRUE ALL COUNTIES X. FROM THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES OUT OF SEPARATE ALLOCATION OF BURNER AND EIGHTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE PURPOSES OF CONTACT TRACING TESTING ETCETERA AND SO. IN ADDITION TO THE FUNDING THAT YOU SEE AND THE LETTER THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I WISH YESTERDAY THERE ARE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL RESOURCES THAT WE'RE PRO ACTIVELY PUSHING OU AT YOUR LOCAL PARTNERS FOR BOTH CONTACT TRACING AND TESTING EFFORTS ON TESTING IN PARTICULAR- WE ARE LOOKING AT IDENTIFYING ADDITIONAL MODALITIES. THE LOOKING AT HOW DO WE LEVERAGE ALL TESTING HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT WE HAVE MOBILE TESTING CAPACITY SO WE'RE WORKING ON. BUILDING OUT THOSE PIECES ON THE CONTACT RACING SIDE BY WE ARE REALLY LOOKING AT HOW DO WE LEVERAGE THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE AT THE LEVEL OF TRANSIT. WE HAVE CURRENTLY. WHILE THE SAME TIME CAN. TO BE ON BECAUSE- YEAH GALLY AUSTIN SAYS WE HAVE TO FIND EQUAL. BUT WE REDUCE THE TRANSMISSION. I DON'T THAT ALLOWS THEM TO CONTACT REYES ALL THE POSITIVE. WHILE AT THE SAME TIME BUILDING UP OUR CONTACT RECENT ACTIVITY. FROM A TECHNOLOGY PERSPECTIVE BUT ON. HUMAN RESPECT. ANSWER ARE ALL POLL AFTER THAT WERE WERE. VERY CLOSELY. I APPRECIATE. THAT NOTE THAT OFTEN MY CONVERSATION WITH ADMINISTRATION PARTICULAR COMES MONEY DOES DON'T INCLUDE NUMBER. AND QUITE. AND QUALITATIVE I TO GET WE'RE DOING THIS WOULD BE THAT THAT'S GOOD BUT- I YOU KNOW FOR A- WOULD BE. TO HAVE- THE REPORTS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONEY AND THEN BROKEN DOWN BY WHAT THE SOURCES ARE. BECAUSE SOMETIMES I HEAR WEALTH AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS GIVING MONEY FOR THIS SO THAT'S BEEN COVERED BY THAT I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH IT IS. SO WE NEED TO BREAK THESE WE NEED TO HAVE THAT TOTAL PICTURE. OF EXACTLY WHAT IS OUR CAPACITY THAT WERE FUNDING. FROM ALL THE DIFFERENT SOURCES AND SO THAT'S THAT'S I'M HOPING WE CAN HAVE THAT KIND OF- REPORTING AND TRANSPARENCY FROM THE FINANCE ADMINISTRATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU MOVING ONTO CENTER DRAWS UP THERE ALSO WILL BE FOLLOWED BY CENTER CABALLERO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I HAVE TWO BASIC QUESTIONS. ONE IS WHY. DID YOU NOT FEEL IT WAS IMPORTANT. TO PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH MORE INFORMATION AND MORE OFTEN. AND JUST TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE AS VICE CHAIR OF THE LATINO CAUCUS I KNOW WE SENT IN. SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FIVE AND TEN LETTERS IDENTIFYING ISSUES AND QUESTIONS AND- THE YOU KNOW REQUEST OF MINE I'D UNDERSTAND THERE WERE A LOT MORE LEGISLATORS WHO ARE DOING THAT SO WHY DDN'T YOU FEEL. IT WAS IMPORTANT OR NECESSARY ODD TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION. JUST TO RESET COLOR WHITE PANTS AGAIN WE REALLY ARE TRYING TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION THAT WE ARE YOU KNOW PROVIDING IN AUGUST UPDATE. WE ARE DOING THAT AS WE ALSO AND ENDEAVORING TO DO IT ON A MONTHLY BASIS THIS WILL HAPPEN AT THE SAME TIME AS WE'RE PUTTING TOGETHER THIS FALL THAT THE JANUARY GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SO THIS IS- TRYING TO REPORT OUT ON A REGULAR BASIS IN PROGRAM CATEGORIES WERE TRYING TO- ALSO TAKE FEEDBACK AS WE'RE HEARING THAT AND REFINE THESE- THIS LOOKS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE PUT OUT IN MAINE WE HAVE A BIT MORE DETAIL. CATEGORY SO AS YOU'RE GATHERING THAT DETAIL WE ARE PUTTING IT OUT THERE- WE ARE TRYING TO. BALANCE WITH PROVIDE IT I TRYING. CLEAR WAY WITH PUTTING IN A LOT OF INFORMATION YOU'LL NOTICE IN OUR MEMO. WE ARE ALSO TRYING TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE CORONAVIRUS REALLY FUND ALLOCATION SO THAT'S KIND OF AND- SENATOR PAM'S POINT AS- SEE MORE OF THE PICTURE SO WE REALLY ARE TRYING TO PUT THAT INFORMATION OUT THERE IN A WAY THAT'S HELPFUL. TO FOLKS AND CATEGORIES THAT- THAT MAKES SENSE AND- SHOW THE PROGRESS AS AS WE MOVE THROUGH THIS DYNAMIC AND YOU KNOW THESE THESE. MEMBERS WILL CHANGE AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO REFINE AND THE FUNDING SOURCES OF WHAT'S AVAILABLE FROM THE FEDERAL FUNDS- MAKE ME CHANGE AND SO WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO DO. EXACTLY AS I DO SENSE. I HAVE ANOTHER BOMB ONE MORE QUESTION- RECENTLY- THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED ADDITION ON THIS IS ABOUT PROCUREMENT. ANNOUNCED ADDITIONAL PROCUREMENT SPENDING- HE EMPHASIZED THAT HE'S WORKING WITH COMPANIES LIKE THREE M. AND HONEYWELL. AS AN EXAMPLE THE FUTURE MASS PROCUREMENTS WILL HAVE A JOB CREATION FOCUS. I HAVE A TWO PART QUESTION WHICH IS HOW ARE YOU ADDRESSING THE STANDARDS THE WORKING STANDARDS OF ANY COMPANY THAT WE ENGAGE IN CONTRACTS WHETHER BY SUPPLIES FROM. WHAT ARE THE STANDARDS THEY'RE FOR THE WORKERS- THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT- THERE'S BEEN NUMEROUS ARTICLES IN LA TIMES AND OTHER OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. ABOUT. A HOUSE WHICH JOBS ARE STILL OPEN OUT YOU AS THEY CALLED UPON TO. MAKE PROTECTIVE GEAR- SO I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT ONE IS A REPORT ON THE ACTUAL THAT THESE PROCUREMENT THESE CONTRACTS LEAD TO JOB CREATION- AND THE STANDARDS FOR THE WORKERS IN THOSE LOCATIONS WHERE WE SPEND OUR TAX DOLLARS. HOW ARE WE WATCHING OUT FOR THE STANDARDS FOR THOSE- WORKERS- I THINK THOSE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT I KNOW GARMENT WORKERS AND OTHER WORKERS WHO AREN'T GETTING- WHAT THEY DO IS WHAT THEY NEED TO CARRY OUT THEIR WORK AND IT COULD BE THIS ADMINISTRATION IS CONTRACTING OUT WITH THOSE COMPANIES. CALDERON FINANCE- AGAIN I DON'T HAVE THOSE DETAILS AT THE READY SO THAT MIGHT BE ANOTHER- IT WILL HAVE TO TAKE BACK TO GET YOU. MORE INFORMATION SENATOR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THIRTY CABALLERO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- FOR THE OPPORTUNITY ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS- MY ME START OFF BY SAYING THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE INFORMATION YOU'RE GIVING US HERE TODAY- YOU KNOW EVERY TIME WE HVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION WE LEARN SOMETHING NEW AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S GREAT BUT- IT MAY BE THAT. WE CAN BE HELPFUL IN SOME OF OUR EFFORTS TO TRY TO STEM THIS- TERRIBLE DISEASE YEAH AND- THAT'S REALLY KIND OF THE POINT THAT I WANT TO THAT I WANT TO LEAVE WITH- DETERMINE WHERE THE MONEY IS BEING SPENT AND THEN. TO WHETHER IT'S ACTUALLY BEING EFFECTIVE AND GETTING US TO A PLACE WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO- OPEN OUR OUR OUR BUSINESSES IN OUR SCHOOLS- SO MY FIRST QUESTION I THOUGHT SO MY DISTRICT HAS TWENTY SEVEN CITIES FOUR OF WHICH ARE LARGER THAN FORTY THOUSAND BUT MOST ARE SMALL. FARMWORKERS RURAL- COMMUNITIES AND IF YOU HAD ASKED ME THREE MONTHS AGO WHETHER I THOUGHT THAT WE WERE GOING TO SEE AN UPSWING OF INFECTION AMONG. LATINO FARMWORKERS I WOULD'VE SAID ABSOLUTELY NUMBER ONE BECAUSE THEY WERE GOING TO WORK AND THE WORK HASN'T CHANGED IN MANY OF THE FEELS. FROM THE WAY THEY DID THE WORK. A YEAR AGO AND I'VE SEEN IT WITH MY OWN EYES AND PEOPLE ARE WORKING SHOULDER TO SHOULDER AND THEN THE GOING HOME TO OVERCROWDED SITUATIONS DURING OUR TO DO DUE TO OUR HOUSING CRISIS- AND SO. WHEN WE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TESTING THE TESTING FOR THE MOST PART HAS BEEN PLACED IN BIG CITIES- IN TERMS OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND SO THAT THE SMALL COMMUNITIES. WHO DESPERATELY NEED TESTING ARE NOT GETTING THE TESTING SITES THAT THEY NEEDED AND SO THERE'S THIS DISCONNECT BETWEEN- WHERE THE-TESTING SITES ARE LOCATED AND WHO GETS FIRST PRIORITY AND WHETHER IT'S EASY ENOUGH. FOR THE FAMILY MEMBERS TO BE ABLE TO GO AND GET A TEST DONE SO TESTING CONTINUES TO BE TO BE A REAL PROBLEM AND BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF TESTING. THE INFECTION RATE HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO EXPLODE TO A POINT WHERE NOW- EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE COUNTIES THAT I REPRESENT THEY DID NOT USED TO BE ON THE RED LEICESTER NOW ON THE RED LAST AND SO- NUMBER ONE IS I'M I'M- CONCERNED ABOUT. WHETHER WORK TOWARD MEETING WITH THE COUNTIES WHO HAVE RECEIVED COUNTIES AND CITIES WHO HAVE RECEIVED KERR'S MONEY SO THAT WERE ADEQUATELY. ALLOCATING THE RESOURCES. TO COVERED IN. pIT'S MOST POP WITH ARE WELL. AND WHERE THEY CAN ACT TOSE TESTINGS REALLY. ON AND THEN THEN NUMBER TWO IS. THAT THE HOUSE FOR. PROGRAM IS REALLY IMPORTANT- BUT WHY IT'S HOUSED IN CDFA. IT IS A QUESTION THAT I ASK AND I LEARNED TODAY THAT THAT'S WHERE IT'S GOING TO BE HOUSE ARM I LOVE CVS CDFA THEY DO TERRIFIC WORK- BUT THEY'RE NOT THE ONES THAT ARE IN CHARGE THAT THAT HAVE CONTACT WITH FARMWORKERS. IF WE REALLY WANT TO GET FARMWORKERS HOUSE AND WHAT WHAT IT SAYS HERE JUST. YOU KNOW AGAIN WHY IT GETS ME GOING IS. IT'S TO PROVIDE SHELTER AND SERVICES TO THOSE IN THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY WILL WE KNOW WHO IT IS THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES. TO SET SAFELY SELF ISOLATE IT'S FARMWORKERS AND SO HOW DO WE GET. INFORMATION AT THE END THE AVAILABILITY OF THIS KIND OF INFRASTRUCTURE TO HELP FARMWORKERS BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY THEY ARE TERRIFIED. THEY'RE BEING ASKED TO WORK EVEN WHEN THEY'RE SICK. IN MANY INSTANCES AND FRANKLY SOMETIMES THEY WORK WHEN THEY'RE SICK BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO WORK THIS IS THIS THIS IS THE PART OF THE SEASON WHERE THERE'S- NOT WORK AVAILABLE. UP SO I AM MY NUMBER ONE ARE WE COORDINATING WITH THE COUNTY IS AND NUMBER TWO WE NEED TO REALLY LOOK AT HOW DO WE GET. FUNDS AT THE GRASSROOTS LEVEL TO START HELPING THE MOST VULNERABLE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS THAT RIGHT. NOW WE KNOW HAVE BECOME. TREMENDOUSLY INFO AND STARTED AFFECT THE FOR SAYS. THANK YOU SENATOR I'LL I'LL START PAN AM TRYING TO RESPOND AT THAT SECOND QUESTION FIRST AND THEN I'LL TURN THE FIRST QUESTION ON TESTING OVER TO MARK ON EACH YEAR BUT ON HOUSING HARVEST IS LED BY THE DEPARTMENT COULD AND I. BUT IT IS A- COMPREHENSIVE EVER THAT DAY IN. THEIR CALL FROM DEPART SOCIAL SERVICES OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES ALSO. THAT BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES HOUSING AGENTS SO THERE'S A- COLLABORATIVE. TO IT IS NOT. JUST SEE IF A WORKING ON IT OWN THEY ARE IN AND HOW YES OF MANY ORGANS AND LOT OF FREE OUTREACH AND DISCUSS WITH COUNTIES AND IS GOING I WILL TURN FIRST QUESTION ON TEST OVER TO. AT JESSE. SENATOR THANK YOU FOR CALL READ CASH IN. AND IN PARTICULAR THE ISSUE AROUND FARMWORKERS AND ABLE TO ENSURE A WE- ARE PROVIDE ASKING. AS THE WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH. TO THE STATE RUN TESTING SO WE WHAT WE HAVE CONTACT WITH OPTIM SERVE AND WE'VE GOT. OUR CLOTHES. AT WE HAVE. PLUS OPTIONS THEIR LEASE I. ACROSS THE STATE WHAT WE LOW AT A WORKING OUR COUNTY PARTNERS FIRST AND FOREMOST DETERMINE. WHERE WE SHOULD LOOK THOSE ON THAT HELLO NAY WE AND- IS OBVIOUS. ARE NOT BEST OUR BETTER FIGURING OUT WHERE THEY NEED IS AT THE LOW LEVEL AND IT WAS. FOR US TO UP. CITIES AND COUNTIES ALLY IT'S I THINK OF. WHERE WE GET AYE AYE I LOOK THOSE THREE. BASED ON THE LOCAL AT WE ALSO LOOKED AT. OUT WAYS WHICH WE COULD ADD. MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE PASS OF. THERE WERE. CASTING LOOKING WITH THIRTY AND ROW AIR AND SIXTEEN EVER RURAL. AND SO WE'VE GOT THAT DISTRICT OF THE STATE THE OTHER THING I NOTE WITH THREE. OKAY FARM IMPRINT. YEAH WE HAVE ACTIVE THROUGH OUR OVER. SERVICE AS S. VALLEY CATS FORCE WHICH IS REALLY. ON I. B. THIS VALLEY COUNTIES. BUT WE'VE ALSO ALLOCATED A HUNDRED DOLLARS AS PART OF THE- DOLLARS THAT I ALLUDED TO IN. TO SENATOR PANTS. REALLY LOOKING B. B. UP OUR MOBILE TO CAPACITY IN THIS IS WHAT WE KERN. FROM OUR PARTNERS PER. FARM AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT. FARM THAT MOBILE TESTING WHAT BE A MUCH. THAT WAY. BE A VALUE AND SO WE HAVE CLOSED AND S. P. AND WHEN WE VERY QUICKLY TECH. ADDITIONAL THAT WE CAN DEPLOY IN PART WITH ACCOUNT IN ORDER FOR US TO HAVE YOU. TO REALLY OUR Y. ARRAY OF END OF. HELP. FOR TESTING. FOR A REALLY LONG TIME BUT LET ME JUST SAY THAT. OUT OF THE SIX COUNTIES THAT I REPRESENT THREE OF THEM HAD SHERIFF'S IT SAID THEY WERE NOT GOING TO ENFORCE THE MASK ORDER- WAY BACK IN IN MAY. AND THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AT THAT POINT WERE VERY RESISTANT TO BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS ACTUALLY A CRISIS SO I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE TO WORK WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS BUT IT'S BEEN REALLY FRUSTRATING. BECAUSE UNTIL RIGHT NOW WHEN EVERYBODY STILL ON THE REDLIST IT'S BEEN VERY DIFFICULT TO GET COOPERATION SO THAT THEY ACTUALLY ALLOCATE RESOURCES TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED IT THE MOST AND SO. THEY ARE PARTNER PARTNERS I WANT TO SEE IS WORK WITH THEM BUT WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND AT SOME POINT IF WE DON'T GET THE COOPERATION THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SAY HOW CAN WE DEAL WITH THIS. IN A WAY THAT. THAT REALLY SHOWS THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT ABOUT PEOPLE THAT ARE SUFFERING. THANK YOU SENATOR AKOWSKI YES MANAGER I'M LOOKING AT THE ESTIMATED EXPENDITURES FROM TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY AND IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND YOU KNOW BECAUSE TWENTY BY TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY HELPS TO SELL THEM IN THE BIGGEST. ADJUSTED I GUESS WAS IN THE PROCUREMENT OF MASKIN OTHER MATERIALS IT WAS ONE POINT EIGHT. BILLION LESS AND YOU KNOW IF WE USE MARCH APRIL MAY AND JUNE IT'S SORT OF A FOUR MONTH PERIOD THAT WE KNOW WE ONLY SPENT YOU KNOW. A BILLION DOLLARS IN THAT FOUR MONTH PERIOD. AND I'M FOLLOWING UP ON MY COLLEAGUES ON THE FOOD BANK WE ONLY REALLY SPEND YOU KNOW TWENTY FIVE. MILLION OR BILLION AND THAT THAT THAT ARE MILLION IN THAT TIME PERIOD THEN WHEN I GET TO TWENTY. TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE'RE GOING TO BE SO WEIRD. WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THIS PANDEMIC IS GOOD TO GO BUT IT'S GOOD TO GO FOR THE FULL TWELVE MONTHS NOT FOR. FOUR MONTHS IN THE PROCUREMENT NUMBER IS. AS MUCH AS WE'D SPENT ON MASK FOR A FOUR MONTH PERIOD. AND THEN. AT THE END THEY'VE WITH THEY DO HAVE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR FOOD BANKS BUT AT THE END THEY HAVE THAT THE OTHER RESPONSE COSTS THE GREAT PLATES DELIVERY. WE WERE THREE HUNDRED MILLION WE THOUGHT THAT WE'RE GOING TO SPEND TWENTY FIVE. MILLION EACH MONTH AND NOW THE NEW ESTIMATE. A MONTH AND A HALF INTO THE BUDGET YEAR IS NOW ONLY TWENTY FIVE BILLION IS SUCH A BIG DISCREPANCY SO CAN THEY TELL. NO WE WILL LEARNING THE BEST LESSONS I GET THE MASS BECAUSE YOU SAY YOU DIDN'T NEED SO MANY OR THEY GOT A BETTER PRICE FOR. OUR PEOPLE LESS HUNGRY- THIRTY BECAUSE I SEE BY JUST CASUALLY WATCH THE TV IT'S JUST SEEMS. EVERY WEEK THERE'S ANOTHER LINE OF A FOOD BANK OPENING UP IN IN THIS THIS. CHARGE OF HUNGER SO WHETHER IT'S IN THE FOOD BANK. OR THE- THE GREAT PLATES DELIVERY IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE CUTTING THAT BACK. AND ASSERT THAT'S- WHAT IF WHAT WE LEARN THE FIRST THE LAST FOUR MONTHS OF THE- LAST BUT YEAR IN AND NOW WE'RE A MONTH AND A HALF INTO THE NEW BUDGET YEAR AND- IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THAT. THERE'S AN INADEQUATE TESTAMENT IS MY POINT. THIS IS. VERY ADVANCED AND ON THE PROCUREMENT OF CERTAIN THE PROCUREMENTS WE ARE. NINETEEN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY PAST FISCAL YEAR DID COME IN LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED OVER ALL WE'RE TRACKING- ALMOST SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS LESS- OVER THE TWO YEARS- STEVEN MENTIONED IS JUST DOING A SCREEN SURE FOR US AND THAT PROCUREMENT SIGNED. WITH BOTH YEARS. TO GATHER IS ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION LAST YEAR THAT'S ALSO RESULT AND SOME OF OUR ESTIMATES OF. PURCHASES THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN IN NINETEEN TWENTY SHIFTING INTO TWENTY TWENTY ONE- SO THAT DYNAMIC WE DO THAT WHAT HAVE WE- LEARNED OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS AS AS JUST BEING SENT MATERIALIZE BY JUNE THIRTIETH BUT- THERE IS STILL AN ANTICIPATED. NEED I THINK THE OTHER QUESTIONS IN OUR WAREHOUSE WE HAD WAS ON THE OTHER RESPONSE COSTLY WHICH IS NEAR THE BOTTOM OF OUR CHURCH. WHAT'S NOT JUST GREAT PLACE SO THAT WHEN Y. AS- AND WHEN WE HAD PROPOSED IN MAY OUR OUR CONTINGENCY WE HAD A THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR LINE IN THERE ANOTHER RESPONSE COST WHICH WAS. THAT A BIT OF A CATCH ALSO GREAT PLATES IS PART OF THAT LINE BUT THAT WASN'T THE ENTIRETY OF THE GREAT PLACE ESTIMATES OR IT DIDN'T REFLECT THE TRAINING MILLION WASN'T REPLACED. YOU'LL NOTICE TWO ONE OF THE DIFFERENCES THAT'S- PRETTY CLOSE TO THAT AMOUNT OF WHAT WE STAYED IN THE OTHER RESPONSE COST IS NOW IN THE STATE RESPONSE OPERATIONS LINE. LAND WHICH IS NEAR THE TOP OF THE CHART AND THAT ONE WENT UP BY- SEVERAL- SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND AGAIN WITH MORE DETAIL SO. ABSOLUTELY CONTINUE TO GET REFINED- THESE WELL THESE WILL CHANGE AGAIN YOU KNOW THAT THAT GOES TO THAT THE NOTION OF HERD REQUESTING MORE. FREQUENT UPDATES AND AGAIN I PLAN TO. UPDATE ON MONTHLY BASIS LIKE I HOPE THAT HELPS. I GUESS IN THE INCREASE- OF ONE POINT ONE. BILLION DOLLARS AND PROCUREMENT IS THAT BECAUSE WE NEED MORE MASTERS IT'S A PRICE PER MASK CAME UP JUST GENERALLY. YEAH I KNOW GENERALLY THAT SOUNDS LIKE A REFERENCE TO THAT TWENTY TWENTY ONE- ESTIMATEA LOT OF THAT IS SHIFTING SO THINGS THAT DIDN'T- PERHAPS MATERIALIZE IN NINETEEN TWENTY OR SHIFTING SO THAT GROSSED OUT ONE POINT ONE FIVE FIVE NUMBER. NEAR THE MIDDLE OF YOUR SCREEN AND THAT IS MOVED MORE AT SHIFT FROM NINETEEN TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE BECAUSE SOME SOME COSTS FOR MASKS DID DECLINE SINCE- CENTER EARLIER ESTIMATE AND ME SO IT'S A MIX OF. BEING. BRIGITTE THAT THOMAS CALVERT ON MONITORING OUR TIME AND LET ME JUST SAY THAT I'M GOING TO HAVE STAFF- FOLLOW UP ON SOME OPERATIONAL QUESTIONS- FOR YOU THAT I HAVE PLEASE IT INCLUDES THINGS LIKE THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH WE EXPECT TO HAVE THE REPORT YOU HEARD LOTS OF COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS AS WELL AS THE L. A. O. AW I'M GOING TO HAVE THEM FOLLOW UP CALL WITH REGARD TO- WHAT YOUR PLAN IS WITH REGARD TO SECTION THIRTY SIX NOTIFICATION IF. IF THEY'LL BE MADE TO LEGISLATURE AS THEY ARE MADE AFTER THEIR MATES ALL WE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW UP ON SOME OF THOSE REPORTING- QUESTION THAT EXPECTATIONS- BUT I DO WANT TO KNOW- BEFORE WE TRANSITION- IF THE STATE EXPENDITURES EXCEED THE CURRENT BUDGET. BUDGET ESTIMATES WHAT SOURCE OF FUNDING WILL THE ADMINISTRATION USE. YES SO AND- RIGHT NOW WE HAVE AS A MENTION ESPECIALLY THE TRIO OF PRESENTATION WE HAVE. THE AMOUNT ESTIMATED ONLY ALSO AS A RESULT OF THAT BUDGET ACT THERE IS ESTIMATED SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN A SPECIAL PLAN FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES ATTRIBUTED TO THAT KIND OF IN THAT GENERAL FUND COSTS FOR THESE. COSTS PRETTY INCREASED COST WE NO COST WILL CHANGE COST COULD INCREASE WE WOULD THEN. NEED TO USE MORE TO REALIZE AND THAT WAS IT AND- IMPACT THE GENERAL FUND AND IT COULD IMPACT IT. MORE IF THESE ARE FOR ACTIVITIES THAT AREN'T FOUND TO BE THEME ARE REIMBURSABLE FROM THAT FUNDING SOURCE- BUT AGAIN WE TRYING TO LOOK AND USE THAT FEDERAL FUNDING AVAILABLE AND TO. MAXIMIZE THAT THAT USED TO FEDERAL FUNDING WHERE APPROPRIATE BUT IT COSTS GO UP IT WOULD BE. AND ALSO. IMPACT OUR GENERAL FUND ESTIMATES MOVING FORWARD OKAY AGAIN WILL HAVE STAFF FOLLOW UP AND I HOPE THAT YOU REALLY- HEARD THE TENOR OF THE- COMMITTEE MEMBERS EXPECTATION THAT THAT EVEN THOUGH JAIL HAS UNDERSTAFFED YOU- SO YOU HAVE CERTAIN FLEXIBILITY THROUGH JAIL ACCOUNT THAT THERE REALLY IS A CLEAR AND ARTICULATED DESIRE THAT THE LEGISLATURE BE ENGAGED IN A VERY FORTHRIGHT UPFRONT MANNER IN TERMS OF PARTNERING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND LOOK LIVE IT UP TO THE EXPECTATION OF OUR ROLE.

IT TAKES DAY THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD CLOSE IN TAKE ON JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE LEGISLATIVE ALTERNATIVE WOULD CLOSE INTAKE BEGINNING ON JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AND THE- ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL DOES NOT INCLUDE A FINAL CLOSURE DATE FOR DJJ CURRENTLY BUT THE MINISTRATION HAS STATED IN AND ARRIVE FIFTEEN DAY. SOMEONE GOING. TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET PROCESS. AND FOR THE CULTURE HAS OCCURRED. THE LEGISLATIVE. WOULD BE PROVIDED OF DECEMBER THIRTY FOR TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND ANY YEARS REMAINING IN DETAIL I THOUGHT THAT DATE WOULD BE TRANSFERRED BACK TO THE COUNTY OF JOB STATION. BUT PROPOSAL'S WOULDN'T. SOME LEVEL OF STATE PLANNING AND OVERSIGHT. UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL UNTIL DJ IS CLOSED. THE EXISTING CHILD WELFARE COUNCIL C. W. C. WHICH IS AN ADVISORY BODY FOR AGENCIES AND COUNTIES THAT SERVE CHILDREN YOUR FOR THE CHILD WELCOME CULTURE CARE SYTEMS WHAT ADVICE DID CHANGE ITS WAYS SUCH AS DEVELOPING STRATEGIES TO AVOID ADULT COURT TRANSFORMERS AND GUIDELINES FOR FUNDING.

THIS FUNDING WILL BE ADJUSTED ANNUALLY BASED ON GROWTH AND THE JUVENILE JUSTICE GROWTH SPECIAL. ACCOUNT IN FUTURE YEARS. THE MONEY WILL BE OUR BASED ON THE COUNTY RECENTLY OF DJJ. AND COUNTY COULD BE GUARANTEED A MINIMUM ORDER OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. YOU SHOULD BE FUNDS WOULD HAVE SOME RESTRICTIONS SUCH AS BEING LIMITED FOR REHABILITATION HOUSING AND SUPERVISION FOR YOU OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE FOR DJJ. BEGINNING ON THE LEFT SEVERAL TARGETED FUNDING WOULD ALSO BEGIN ON JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT BASS LINE FUNDING WOULD START AT TWENTY SEVEN MILLION GENERAL FUND AND INCREASED TO ONE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE MILLION ANNUALLY BY JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. THE FUNDING WILL BE ALLOCATED BASED ON A FORMULA THAT INCLUDES FACTORS SUCH AS THE COUNTY'S YOUTH POPULATION THE NUMBER OF YEARS WITH OFFENSES. WOULD HAVE BEEN DJJ ELIGIBLE AND ON A TEMPORARY BASIS THE RECENT USE OF DJJ. SIMILAR TO MICHAEL PROPOSAL COUNTIES WOULD BE GUARANTEED A MINIMUM. ORDER OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. THERE WOULD ALSO BE RESTRICTIONS BY ON THIS WHICH WOULD INCLUDE LIMITS ON CERTAIN TYPES OF PRIVATE CONTRACTING. AND WITH ALL THE BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THAT COUNTIES ANNUALLY SUBMIT A PLAN SUBJECT TO STATE APPROVAL DETAILING HOW THE FUNDING WOULD BE USED AS WELL AS AN OUTCOME REPORT FOR THE RESULTS OF PROGRAMS. OPERATED WITH THIS FUNKY. IT IS TO THE BASELINE FROM BOTH ROSE ALL ALSO PROVIDED ADDITIONAL FROM THE THAT COULD BE USED FOR THIS POPULATION ANOTHER MINISTRATION PROPOSAL. THAT WOULD SET ASIDE NINE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR ONE TIME STARTUP GRANTS DEVELOP LOCAL CONTINUUM OF CARE INCLUDING REGIONAL TREATING FACILITIES. AND SEX OFFENDER TREATMENT PROGRAM. IT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE LANGUAGE CLARIFYING THAT COUNTIES CAN USE THEIR EXISTING YOUTHFUL OFFENDER BACHRACH. RIGHT ENHANCE SERVICES TO YOU IF YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN D. J. J. L. DOUBLE IN RECENT YEARS IS FUNDING HAS BEEN ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS. THE REGIONAL MOSEL WOULD ALSO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL GRANT FUNDING THROUGH TWO DIFFERENT GRANT I WOULD GET THE FIRST WOULD BE A ONE TIME COMPETITIVE GRANT TO SUPPORT JUVENILE JUSTICE INFRASTRUCTURE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE SECURE PLACEMENTS AND PROGRAM E. THIS. WOULD BE- ONGOING COMPETITIVE GRANT FOR EVIDENCE BASED AND PROMISING PROGRAMS WHICH WILL BE DELIVERED BY NON LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITIES. FOR PROGRAMS TARGETED TOWARDS USING WOULD HAVE BEEN DETECTED ELIGIBLE. IN ADDITION TO PRIVATE MONEY THE PROTOCOLS WILL ALSO PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON WHERE YOU CAN BE HOUSE EVERY OTHER THAN MINISTRATION PROPOSAL REALIGNED YOU FIFTY HOUSE AND ONE OF VARIOUS TYPES OF EXISTING COUNTY JUVENILE FACILITIES CURRENTLY SPECIFIED IN STATUTE WHICH INCLUDE DO NOT HOMES RANCHES CAMPS FOR HOLES IN ADDITION COUNTIES CAN USE THE START OF BROWN'S TO PROVIDE. FOR REGIONAL TREATMENT FACILITIES. ANALOGICAL TERM IN ADDITION THAT EXIST TAX AND JUVENILE.

IT FOR YOU THIS CAN COMMITTED TO ONE OF THESE NEW FACILITIES THE COURT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SET THE TRUMP CONFINEMENT FOR ANY USE COMMITTED TO BE SOLELY. BASED ON COMPLIANCE TERMS WHICH WOULD BE SET BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. THEY WERE ALSO BE CHANGES TO EXISTING HE AND FUNDING STRUCTURE FOR DJJ HE- UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. USE WHAT.

CALL USED BEFORE THE FINAL CLOSURE DATE SPECIFICALLY BETWEEN JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE AT DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO COUNCIL RECEIVED ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EACH USER. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN. AUSTIN DJJ FOR THE TIME HER THEY WOULD HELP SECURE. THE FUNDING WOULD BE OFFSET BY THAT REDUCE COSTS FROM HOUSES IF INDEED IT. THE PROPOSAL WOULD ALSO HAVE AN IMPACT ON YOUTH SENTENCE TO PRISON. CURRENTLY CERTAINLY USED TO BE TRANSFERRED FROM JUVENILE COURT TO ADULT COURT AND SENTENCED JEFFERSON. EXPECTATIONS WHEN THE UNITS UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN J. J. HOUSES THAT YEARS UNTIL THEY ARE EIGHTEEN CONTRACTS FOR THE PERSON. WHEN DJ CLOSES UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL COUNTIES WITH HAVE YOUTH SENTENCED TO PRISON UNTIL THEY ARE EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD AND THE STATE PAID ACCOUNT HE'S A RATE OF SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY DOLLARS PER DAY DURING THIS PERIOD. WHEN YOU USE OUR. EIGHTEEN THEY WOULD THEN BE TRANSFERRED TO PRISON. I WOULD LIKE ABLE TO. COUNTIES WOULD. YOU TO PRISON UNTIL THEY ARE EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD SOME OF THE GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSAL. THE LEGISLATIVE ALTERNATIVE WOULD CONSIDER THIS POPULATION TO BE PART OF THE REALIGNED RESPONSIBILITIES. AS SUCH NO FUNDING WOULD BE PROVIDED DURING THAT PERIOD WHEN COUNTIES OUR HOUSING EASY IF. I WANT. TO USE OUR EIGHTEEN AND TRANSFERRED TO PRISON THEY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTION REHABILITATION IS MARGINAL COST. FOR THE DURATION OF THE YOUTH SENTENCE. ANOTHER HELPING IMPACT THE REALIGNMENT IS AGES JURISDICTION FOR JUVENILE COURSE. COOLEY COURTS CAN ONLY RETAIN JURISDICTION UNTIL AN INDIVIDUAL IS TWENTY ONE A LOT LESS THE YOUTH IS COMMITTED TO DJJ. COROZAL SQUATTING PLAYED THE SAME LANGUAGE TO ACTUAL FUNERAL COURT JURISDICTION SPECIFICALLY TO INCREASE THE AGE OF JURISDICTION IN TWENTY THREE FOR YOUTH EDUCATED FOR CERTAIN OFFENSES. OR UP TO TWENTY FIVE IF THE YOUTH WOULD HAVE RECEIVED A SENTENCE OF SEVEN OR MORE YEARS IN CRIMINAL COURT. THIS IS INTENDED TO BE ARE THEIR AGES JURISDICTION. FOR YOUTH COMMITTEE DJ. BOTH ARRIVALS ARE ALSO IN IN LANGUAGE TO THE PINE GROVE YOUTH COME. CAMP OPENED WHICH IS A FIRE YEAH. LOCAL STATE. STATE LOCAL PARTNERSHIP OR SOME OTHER ARRANGEMENT. THE LEGISLATIVE ALTERNATIVE IT DOES INCLUDE SOME PROVISIONS ARE NOT ADDRESSED IN THE GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSAL. FIRST PLACE ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON THE TRANSPORT USED TO ADULT FACILITIES. CURRENTLY I DO NOT USE IT WAS HEALTH LOCALLY AND HE WAS NINETEEN ALL OR CAN BE MOVED TO AN ADULT FACILITIES AT THE JAIL UPON RECOMMENDATION OF PROBATION. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT WOULD ALTERNATE. AN ADDITIONAL STEP BE REQUIRED IN WHICH A COURT WHEN YOU APPROVAL SUCH A MOVE BEFORE COULD TAKE PLACE. IN ADDITION THE ALLEGED ALTERNATIVE WOULD. VERIFICATION PLAN FOR IMPROVING JUVENILE JUSTICE DATA COLLECTION BY REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO SUBMIT A PLAN BY JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY TWO FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THE CURRENT JUVENILE COURT- INFORMATION STATISTICAL SYSTEM WHICH PROBABLY IS THAT WAY INCLINED IN DATA ON LOCAL JUVENILE JUSTICE STATE. FINALLY THE LESS IT WILL TURN IT WOULD INCLUDE INTENT LANGUAGE TO END THE PRACTICE OF PLACING YOU IN THE CUSTODY OF SOME PRIVATE ENTITIES OR IN OTHER STATE ENTITIES THAT DO NOT PROPERLY ADDRESSED THE PROGRAMMING AND SERVICE SAFETY AND OTHER NEEDS. HI STEVE. THANK YOU. ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU MUCH GOING TO MOVE ON- TO- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CLICK CALLUM. GOOD MORNING CALENDAR BERMAN A FINANCE. I APPRECIATE DALY- PRESENTING THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL I JUST WANT TO TAKE A QUICK OPPORTUNITY DISCUSS OUR PROPOSAL A LITTLE FURTHER WE SEE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PROPOSAL AND FURTHER REFORMING THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT BUILT ON PREVIOUS SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS BY TRANSFERRING THE MANAGEMENT OF ALL YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS AND DJJ TO COUNTY. BECAUSE THOSE CONSISTENT WITH THE EVIDENCE THAT SHOWS JUSTICE INVOLVED YOUTH ARE MORE SUCCESSFUL WHEN THEY STAY CONNECTED WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES FUNDING FOR COUNTIES TO PROVIDE YOUTH WITH MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT SPECIALIZED PROGRAMMING IN EDUCATION. EVASION APARTMENTS HAVE LED THE EFFORT. TO REDUCE INCARCERATED YOUTH OF THE LOCAL LEVEL. REDUCING THE CARBON FROM OVER A LOT THOUSAND IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN TO THIRTY SIX HUNDRED AND TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN A DECREASE OF ALMOST SEVENTY PERCENT. IT IS THIS DEMONSTRATED TRACK RECORD ALONG WITH EVIDENCE OF YOU BEING MORE SUCCESSFUL LOCALLY THAT IS INFORMED THIS PROPOSAL. THE PROPOSAL IS NOT INTENDED TO REDUCE STATE OVERSIGHT. APPROPRIATE SAFEGUARDS AND PARAMETERS ARE NEEDED FOR THE TRANSFER OF THIS RESPONSIBILITY AS IS THE STATE'S ASSISTANCE IN ESTABLISHING NEW COUNTY PROGRAMS FOR THESE HIGH NEED YOU. WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY PROVIDERS ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE. THANKS VERY MUCH MR KELLAM- CALLING YOU'RE GONNA TRANSITION NOW- TO OUR PANEL.

THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO OFFER A MARKS ON BEHALF OF THE PARK. THIS HISTORIC DISCUSSION THAT WILL MOVE USE PLACED AT DJJ CLOSER TO HOME IS FILLED WITH HOPE. AND THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER SHARE THAT HOPE. HOWEVER IT'S NOT WITHOUT POTENTIAL UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES MANY OF WHICH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WOULD BE LEFT TO RESOLVE. THEREFORE WELL WE REGISTERED OUR OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED TO THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION. SINCE THEN WE'VE ENGAGED IN ROBUST DISCUSSIONS WITH POLICYMAKERS TO RESPOND TO THIS MOMENT AND STRIVE TO PARTNER IN ACCOMPLISHING SOMETHING HISTORIC. WHILE ENSURING IT CAN SAFELY BE ACCOMPLISHED. IN A WAY THAT IMPROVES OUTCOMES FOR YOU. PROBATION CHIEFS WORKED HARD TO TRANSFER OUR WORK SHIFTING TO A POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK. LETTING GO OF OUTDATED INEFFECTIVE MODELS AND INVESTING IN TRAINING AND EDUCATION TO CREATE A MORE HEALTH FOCUSED TRAUMA INFORMED AND- PASSIONATE JEWEL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THAT DIVERTS THE MAJORITY OF YOU AND UTILIZES INDIVIDUALIZED APPROACH FOR THOSE WITH HIGH NEEDS TO HELP THEM ACHIEVE LONG TERM SUCCESS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER WHERE WE'VE COME FROM AND HOW FAR WE HAVE COME. CALIFORNIA TODAY HAS A JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM WERE OVER 95% OF YOU ARE SUCCESSFULLY SERVE LOCALLY. AND WHERE 90% OF USED UNDER OUR CARE AND SUPERVISION ARE SAFELY TREATED IN OUR COMMUNITIES. MASON IS A UNIQUE AND I AM DUPLICATED CONNECTOR IN THE SYSTEM THAT HELPS THE MOST VULNERABLE AND FRAGILE YOU. WE TOUCH SO MANY ASPECTS WITH OUR CONTINUUM AND OFTEN SERVE AS A SAFETY NET FOR USE WITH. OTHER SYSTEMS HAVE FAILED. CALIFORNIA PROBATION IS UNIQUE IN THE NATION AS WELL WE COLLABORATE WITH MANY STATE ENTITIES AS WE SERVE OUR COURTS ARE LOCAL BARD OF SUPERVISORS AND OUR COMMUNITIES. WE'VE PARTNERED WITH MANY OF YOU WELL WE'VE ADVOCATED FOR AND IMPLEMENTED MANY JUVENILE JUSTICE REFORMS FOR MORE THAN A DECADE. INCLUDING JUVENILE JUSTICE REALIGNMENT OR S. B. EIGHTY ONE THE REALIGNMENT OF THE JUVENILE CORAL SYSTEM. CONTENT YOU KNOW CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM FOCUSING ON FOSTER YOUTH. AND RETURNING THE AUTHORITY FOR TRANSFERS TO ADULT COURT BACK TO JUDGES AS PART OF PROP THIRTY SEVEN. BUT MORE CAN BE DONE AND SHOULD BE DONE. MOST RECENTLY WE EMBARK IN AN EFFORT TO RAISE THE AGE OF JUVENILE COURT JURISDICTION AND CODIFY BEST PRACTICES TO REFLECT A MORE EQUITABLE DELIVERY OF SERVICES TO YOUTH ACROSS ALL JURISDICTIONS. ALSO NOTICED ELEVATE JUSTICE ACT. WE ACKNOWLEDGE AND THANK SENATOR SKINNER AND OTHERS AND HELPING US EMBARK ON THIS IMPORTANT DISCUSSION THAT CAN CHANGE THE LIVES OF OUR EMERGING ADULT POPULATION. ALSO STRENGTHENING THE ENTIRETY OF OUR WORK WITH THE JUVENILE JUSTICE. TODAY THE CONVERSATION FOCUSES ON THE CLOSURE OF DJJ AND PROBATION CHIEFS ARE PREPARED TO HELP THE STATE SHAPE WHAT IS NEEDED TO MAKE THAT SUCCESSFUL. WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT IT'S DONE IN SUCH A WAY THAT WE ENHANCE OUTCOMES FOR YOUTH. AND SPECIFICALLY WHAT WE MUST BE ABLE TO TAILOR PROGRAMS SERVICES CAPACITY AND DELIVERY METHODS TO THE NEEDS OF THE YEAR. WE MUST BE ABLE TO RELY ON STABLE SECURE FISCAL SUPPORT TO KAREN TREAT THESE COMPLEX AND HIGH NEED YOU. WE MUST ACCOUNT FOR COUNTIES THAT DO NOT HAVE CAPACITY FOR THE APPROPRIATE CAPACITY FOR TREATMENT. WE CANNOT BUILD A SYSTEM THAT LEAVES SOME YOUTH BEHIND WITHOUT HOPE. WE MUST INVEST IN THE REDESIGN OF OUR SPACES TO TRANSFORM THEM INTO MORE THERAPEUTIC HOME LIKE ENVIRONMENTS. MORE REFLECTIVE OF THE TROM INFORMED WORK THAT OUR YOUTH REQUIRE. WE MUST ACHIEVE A CLEAR BALANCE OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND TREATMENT WITHIN THE NEW MODEL THAT INSTILLS CONFIDENCE IN OUR SYSTEM PARTNERS SO THAT WE AVOID MORE YOUTH ENTERING THE ADULT SYSTEM. WE MUST COORDINATE ADDITIONS TO THE SYSTEM THAT WILL NOT DUPLICATE THE MANY ENTITIES CURRENTLY COLLABORATING. ON PLANNING AND OVERSIGHT WHILE THIS CURRENT CONSTRUCT CAN SEE EXHAUSTIVE BY THE ENTITY IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER THEY SERVE AS A CONTINUUM. OF CHECKS AND BALANCES THAT WORK TOGETHER. AND FINALLY AS THE STATE WE CANNOT DIRECTLY OR INADVERTENTLY CREATE A SCENARIO WHEREBY THE REALIGNMENT OF DJJ HARMS OVER 95% OF YOU. WE CURRENTLY WORK WITH AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. WE ARE TO THE LEGISLATURE TO FOCUS ON THE INTEGRATION OF THE DJJ POPULATION DURING THE SCRIPT CRITICAL WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY. IN CLOSING WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO EVERY YEAR THAT'S IN OUR CARE AND AS A MOTHER. I FEEL A PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO EVERY MOTHER GRANDMOTHER ANSWER I'LL OTHER LOVED ONE WAS A CHILD AT ONE OF OUR FACILITIES. THE NEEDS NEEDS YOU HAVE THE TRAUMA THEY'VE BEEN DOOR CANNOT BE TAKEN LIGHTLY AND WE MUST ENSURE WE'RE NOT JUST ANOTHER FAILED SYSTEM THAT THEY WILL CYCLE THROUGH. THE DJJ POPULATION HAS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT SKIN NEEDS AND REQUIRE NOTHING SHORT OF OUR BEST RESEARCH DATA EXPERTISE AND COMMITMENT. AS I SIT AND TALK TO THE YOUTH R. TRUST UNIT IN THE SPACE THAT'S BEEN RECONFIGURED LIKE A FAMILY ROOM IN SOMEONE'S HOME RATHER THAN INSTITUTIONAL DAY ROOM. I REMINDED WHILE THERE IS STILL MUCH WORK TO BE DONE WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY. WHEN I WATCH THE YOUTH ARE CARE SHARE THEIR ART WORK OR ENJOY AN OLD FASHIONED WATER BALLOON FIGHT ON A HOT DAY. I'M REMINDED WHY WE WORK SO HARD TO ALLOW THEM TO BE CHILDREN. IF DONE WELL THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO MUCH MORE TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM WHAT KEEPING OUR CHILDREN IN OUR COMMUNITY. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE PROBATION CHIEF STAND READY TO WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND THE ADMINISTRATION TO ACCOMPLISH. THE REALIGNMENT OF DJJ. IN A WAY THAT ACHIEVES OUR SHARED GOALS. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FIVE MILLION WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL STAY. ON IN CASE MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS- OF YOU AFTER- ALL OF THE PANELS THAT ARE PRESENTED- DOCTOR ROSS. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR CAN YOU HEAR ME OK I CAN HEAR YOU FINE THANK YOU. MORNING MANAGER SIR GREAT TO SEE YOU- AND THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE INVITED TO. SPEAKS OF THIS HISTORIC RESTORED MOMENT BUT THAT AS YOU KNOW WELL MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR SEVERAL SPINNERS WELCOMES YOU HAVE IT'SA CONDUCTOR ROSS WOULD YOU SPEAK UP JUST A LITTLE BIT I HAVE BEEN BIRDS ARE HAVING A HARD TIME HEARING YOU. IT'S ONLY A HISTORIC MOMENT IF WE GET IT RIGHT IS THAT BETTER YES THANK YOU. IT'S ONLY HISTORIC MOMENT THERE IF WE GET IT RIGHT AND I JUST WANTED TO SPEAK TO WHAT. THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE A DEGREE TESTIMONY FROM- TWO CATALYSTS- BETTER. BALL MADE. AS A PEDIATRICIAN A PRESIDENCY OF THE CALIFORNIA TELEPHONE WHAT THE STYLE OF ASIAN. OF THE CALIFORNIA ENDOWMENT WE HAVE TO STAND UP THE MOST. SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTORS TO HELP. OUR LAW OUTSIDE THE MEDICAL. OUR CHEN YEAR ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN BUILDING HEALTHY COMMUNITIES HAS TAUGHT US THAT OUR WELL BEING SHAPED BY THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH WE ARE BORN GROW LIVE. WORK AND PLAY.THESE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS HAVE BEEN A OBJECT LESSON THE HARD LESSONS ABOUT OUR NATION ON THE MATTER OF WHAT HAPPENS IN THESE ENVIRONMENTS INSTRUCTORS ARE LACKING. HOLDEN NINETEEN SAVAGE HEALTH AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS THAT DISPROPORTION FOLLOWING NEWS OF COLOR BURKE STRESSED OUT REGIONAL SYSTEMIC RACISM AS WELL DEFENDER INVESTMENT IN FORWARD POLICING IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND THIS EXTENDS THE DJJ WERE 93% OF INCARCERATED YOUNG PEOPLE ARE YOU ALL. WE HAVE SPENT TOO MUCH MONEY ON SURVEILLANCE CRIMINALIZATION AND THE TENSION AND FAR TOO LITTLE ON HEALTHCARE HOUSING JOBS. AND SCHOOLS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. WE KNOW WHAT IT TAKES TO HELP. THESE YOUNG PEOPLE SO IN GROWING FOR NEXT GENERATION OF LEADERS. IT IS THE LAW OF CARE IN SUPPORT OF THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR LOCAL INSTITUTIONS. I ENCOURAGE THAT WE HAVE THIS HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY TO BRING YOU THE DJJ FACILITIES BACK TO THEIR HOME UNITY IS THAT IT CAN BE CLOSER TO THIS KIND OF SUPPORT. MANY OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE SUPPORTERS OF CHILDHOOD TRAUMA. VIOLENCE NEGLECT AND OTHER FORMS OF ADVERSITY IN THE INTERFERE. NEVER LOGICALLY OF INTERFERE WITH THE HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR BODIES AND MINDS. YOU CAN EXPOSE THE TRIAL OR MORE LIKELY TO HAVE A FIGHT OR FLIGHT RESPONSIBLE MEANS OF CRISIS. AS THE BRAIN GOES INTO SURVIVAL MODE AND THIS CAN LEAD TO RASH DECISIONS AND SOMETIMES TRAGIC MISTAKES. THE FIRST QUESTION A POSITION TRAINED TO TROUBLE ASK IS. WHAT HAPPENS AND- NOT WHY DID YOU DO THAT. WE WANT TO HELP YOUNG PEOPLE LEARN FROM MISTAKES GET BACK ON TRACK WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSE. THE YOUNG PERSON'S OF USING DRUGS WHAT IS THE CAME HERE TRYING TO KNOW. IS IT BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN A VICTIM OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE. IF SOMEONE STOLE SOMETHING FROM A GROCERY STORE WAS IT BECAUSE HE WAS ONE. THE PERSON RACIAL NOT ADDRESS THESE RECALLS IF. WHAT WE KNOW WHAT WILL. YOUNG PEOPLE THRIVE WHEN THEY HAVE SUPPORT IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND PARTS SEPARATED FROM THEIR FAMILIES SCHOOLS AND LOCAL SUPPORT. A COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH REVIEW BY THE NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL TWENTY THIRTEEN REPEAL THE COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES PRODUCED MUCH BETTER OUTCOMES FOR YOUTH. REDUCE RECIDIVISM AND COSTS LESS SIMPLY MOVING YOU FROM LARGE SCALE STATE FACILITIES FOR LOCAL EQUIVALENTS IS NOT THE ANSWER. THIS APPROACH IS BEING TAKEN UP FOR OVERLOOKING COUNTY LEADERS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE'VE SEEN NINE YOUR FACILITIES OF CLOSE SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AND MORE THAN SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS SINCE BEEN REDIRECTED TO PROGRAMS OPERATED BY NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE SUCCEEDING IN REDUCING YOUR FOR US AS MUCH AS THIRTY PERCENT. AND YOU THINK RESTORATION BY AS MUCH AS 50% CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO WITH PLANNING TO CLOSE ITS OLD JUVENILE HALL AND REINVEST THOSE RESOURCES INTO COMMUNITY ALTERNATIVES. REALIGNMENT OFFERS OF THE OFFERS US A CHANCE TO CHANGE THE NARRATIVE AROUND WHAT IT TAKES TO CREATE COMMUNITIES SAY. THAT WE ACHIEVE IT NOT THROUGH BARS WITH MEANINGFUL INVESTMENTS AND DEVELOPMENT OF YOUNG PEOPLE. WHO ARE MOST IN NEED OF OUR SUPPORT. WHO ARE STRUGGLING OF BEST SERVER HEALTH SERVICES INFRASTRUCTURE NOT THE JUSTICES. PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE ARE WITH US ON THIS POINT I FEEL POLL CONDUCTED MARCH FOUR YEARS AGO INDICATED THAT MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF CALIFORNIANS BELIEVE. THAT THE EDUCATION HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS ARE BEST SUITED TO SUPPORT YOUR CORE SYSTEM BALL. SO WE MUST SEPARATE AND VISION FOR NEW SYSTEM THAT SEES PEOPLE FOR THEIR YOUNG PEOPLE FOR THEIR POTENTIAL NOT THE WORST MISTAKES THEY'VE EVER MADE. WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT CREATING THE SERVICE CRITICAL NEED TO FINANCIALLY SUPPORT COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. WHO HAVE LONG BEEN A PART OF RESOURCES OR WE ALSO BRING ABOUT A NET DECREASE IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE ACROSS ALL SECURE THE SUIT. THE BILL AND JUVENILE STATE AND LOCAL. REENTRY WILL HAVE LOCALLY IN OUR- OF THE STATE STILL HAS A- CRITICAL TO PLAY AN OVERSIZED FUNDING. ISSUE STRONG ACCOUNTABILITY OVERSIGHT. GIVEN BY AGENCY OUTSIDE OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM WITH EXPERTISE THE NEW. AND HEALTH AND WELLNESS. AGENCY SHOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT PARTY INFORM SUBPOENA POWER IT'S MANDATE SHOULD INCLUDE RESPONSIBILITY FOR COUNTY DATA COLLECTION. AND REPORTING TO TRACK ME COOPER. HUNGARY HAD SOME OF WELL BEING NOT SIMPLY GREAT ABSENCE OF JUSTICE SYSTEM INVOLVEMENT. AS TRACK NEARLY BARS CITIZENS. SUPPORTING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY FOR ME REDUCING THE FOOTPRINT OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT TAKES THEM AWAY FROM THEIR HOMES AND THEIR FAMILIES.

WE CHAMPION POLICIES AND PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE ALL CHILDREN WITH THE RESOURCES AND OPPORTUNITIES THEY DESERVE SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITION INTO ADULTHOOD AND BECOME DRIVING ENGAGE MEMBERS OF THEIR COMMUNITIES. AS DR OZ SAID THE POSSIBLE CLOSURE AT DJJ PRESENT IN HISTORIC CROSSROADS FOR CALIFORNIA. IF DONE RIGHT THE STATE WILL BE SET ON A PATH OF EVIDENCE BASED BEST PRACTICES THAT BUILD ON THE POTENTIAL OF OUR STATES YOU. IF DONE WRONG THE STATE WIL HAVE MISSED A CRUCIAL OPPORTUNITY ONCE AGAIN AND THE LIVES OF CHILDREN AND COMMUNITIES WILL BE HARMED. THIS CROSSROAD COMES AT A TIME WHEN WE HAVE ALL BEEN FORCE TO RECKON WITH THE UNCONSCIONABLE RACIAL AND SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC INEQUITIES CAUSED BY OUR SYSTEMS. INCLUDING THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. FOR FAR TOO LONG WE HAVE RELIED ON SURVEILLANCE CONTROL AND PUNISHMENT TO RESPOND TO YOUR BEHAVIOR AND THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN DEVASTATING. JUSTICE SYSTEMS TOO OFTEN CRIMINALIZED NORMAL ADOLESCENT BEHAVIOR FAILED TO ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSES OF UNHEALTHY BEHAVIOR AND INCREASE THE CHANCES OF FUTURE DELINQUENCY. AND LET US BE PERFECTLY CLEAR ABOUT WHO IS IMPACTED BY THESE FAILURES. ARE BLACK BROWN AND INDIGENOUS YOU BEAR THE BRUNT OF THE STATE'S MOST HARMFUL JUSTICE SYSTEM PRACTICES. AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY BLACK YOUTH ARE TWENTY TWO MORE TIMES LIKELY THAN WHAT USED TO BE INCARCERATED PRE TRIAL. LET NEXT YOU ARE THREE POINT SEVEN TIMES MORE LIKELY AND IN TWENTY NINETEEN A 100% OF THE YOUTH TRANSFERRED TO THE ADULT SYSTEM WHERE YOU THE COLOR. WE CAN DO BETTER AND WE MUST DO BETTER. WE DO BETTER BY EMBRACING A HOLISTIC YOUTH DEVELOPMENT APPROACH FOCUSED ON PROVIDING OUR YOUTH WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO LEARN. TO HEAL TO DEVELOP THEIR SOCIAL SOCIAL EMOTIONAL PHYSICAL AND COGNITIVE COMPETENCIES WITH THE SUPPORT OF CARING FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. AND LOS ANGELES WE HAVE BEGUN TO TRANSFORM OUR YOUTH JUSTICE SYSTEM BY BRINGING ALL SECTORS TOGETHER. INCLUDING COMMUNITY AND SYSTEM IMPACTING YOUNG PEOPLE TO ADOPT A PUBLIC HEALTH FOCUSED APPROACH WOULDN'T KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ADOLESCENT DEVELOPMENT. WHAT WE NEED NOW IS A LEADERSHIP CONSTRUED THIS HAPPENS ACROSS THE STATE. CALIFORNIA MUST CREATE A STATE LEVEL OVERSIGHT WITH EXPERTISE AND YOU HEALTH AND WELL BEING. NOT ADULT CORRECTION PHILOSOPHIES. THIS NEW AGENCIES TO HOLD A VARIETY OF RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDING COLLECTING AND ANALYZING DATA. DEVELOPING AND ENFORCING REGULATIONS SERVING AS AN OMBUDSMAN ADMINISTERING GRANTS PROVIDING TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND EDUCATING. AND TRAINING STAKEHOLDERS AND BEST PRACTICES. ONE OF HIS GREATEST TO BE TO ENSURE WISE INVESTMENT AND EFFECTIVE USE DEVELOPMENT BASED OUTCOME DRIVEN PROGRAMS AND ENSURE CONSISTENT DELIVERY OF SUCH PROGRAMS ACROSS ALL COUNTIES SHOULD AVOID JUSTICE BY GEOGRAPHY. A GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH INCLUDING THE TO YOUR COMPREHENSIVE STUDY OF BY THE NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL THE DOCTOR ROSS MENTIONED IT'S CLEAR ON THE TYPES OF SERVICES THAT EACH SUCCESSFUL THAT HE SUCCESSFULLY THE OUTCOMES. SERVICES SHOULD BE GROUNDED IN YOUTH DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES INDIVIDUALLY TAILORED ENGAGE FAMILIES AND COMMUNITY RESOURCES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND BE PROVIDED OUTSIDE OF INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS. THAT'S THE STATE'S TO PRIORITIZE INVESTMENT AND WHAT WORKS HEALING CENTER AND CULTURALLY RELEVANT EVIDENCE THE EVIDENCE BASED ON COMMENTS HE PROGRAMS LOCATED IN COMMUNITIES WHERE YOU PLAN. IN THE EARLY STAGES OF REALIGNMENT AND ADOPTION OF A STATE WIDE NEEDS DEVELOPMENT APPROACH. EXPERTS RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR SMALLER SECURE FACILITIES FOR A LIMITED POPULATION OF YOU. PARTICULARLY TO AVOID AN INCREASE OF TRANSFERS OF YOU TO THE ADULT SYSTEM. IN LINE WITH RESEARCH THESE FACILITIES SHOULD BE USED SPARINGLY AND SHOULD HAVE NON PRISON LIKE STRUCTURES AND ENVIRONMENTS ARE PROGRAMMING METRIC RECREATION AND LIVING LIVING SPACES. AND WHENEVER POSSIBLE COMMUNITY WOULD HAVE PROVIDERS TO BE USED. PARTICULARLY TO FACILITATE CONTINUITY OF CARE SO THAT YOU CAN MAINTAIN POSITIVE CONSISTENT AND LASTING CONNECTIONS WITH OTHER YOUTH AND ADULTS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES UPON RELEASE. THE RESEARCH IS THERE WE KNOW HOW TO IMPROVE THESE OUTCOMES OF PUBLIC SAFETY. WE HAVE A COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY IS NOT FAIL OUR YOUTH AND DEEP IN OUR CURRENT EQUITIES IN OUR SYSTEM. DJJ CLOSURE MUST BE IMPLEMENTED WITH A BOTH ROBUST OVERSIGHT AND POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT AS A CORNERSTONE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. I PPRECIATE YOU MISTER GASKINS OF FINALLY WILL HEAR FROM FRANKIE GOOS MON DIRECTOR. YOU'VE JUST INITIATIVE AT THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR YOUTH LAW. FIVE MINUTES MISTER GOODMAN. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I HAVE. I AM THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME I AM FRANKIE WAS MINE I'M AN ATTORNEY AT THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR YOUTH LAW A NONPROFIT LAW FIRM IN OAKLAND THAT THAT HELPS LOW INCOME CHILDREN ACHIEVE THEIR POTENTIAL BY TRANSFORMING THE PUBLIC AGENCIES THAT SERVE THEM I WAS ALSO INCARCERATED AS A USE. IN THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE OR BACK THEN THE CALIFORNIA SORRY WEST SPENT SIX YEARS. LAST YEAR. RECOGNIZING THE NEED TO SHIFT TO A HEALTH BASED TRAUMA INFORMED AND REHABILITATIVE APPROACH TO THE STATE'S JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. GOVERNOR NEWSOM ANNOUNCED HIS PROPOSAL TO SHIFT DJJ FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. TO THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. WHAT THE LEGISLATURE'S APPROVAL CALIFORNIA COMMITTED TO MOVING TOWARD A PUBLIC A PUBLIC BASED APPROACH TO HELPING USE. RATHER THAN INVESTING IN SYSTEMS OF SYSTEMS OF CONTROL AND PUNISHMENT. NOW THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES REVERSING COURSE OFFERING A PLAN TO SHIFT THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR HOUSTON DJJ TO THE FIFTY EIGHT POUNDS. GUARANTEEING MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED MILLION ANNUALLY. AND PRIMARILY TO A LOCAL PROBATION DEPARTMENTS WITH LITTLE OVERSIGHT GUIDANCE OR ACCOUNTABILITY FOR HOW FUNDS WILL BE USED. AND USE WILL BE TREATED. WE'RE ALL AWARE OF THE SOCIAL UNREST OVER RACIAL INEQUALITY AND CALLS FOR CHANGES TO OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. REIGNITING THE ONGOING SITE FOR JUSTICE FOR BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND THE NATION. IF REALIGNMENT IS DONE THE RIGHT WAY CALIFORNIA WILL BE ABLE TO REDUCE ITS INEQUITIES THAT USED IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM FACE AND GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITIES OF COURSE THEY NEED TO THRIVE. THE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL WILL ACCOMPLISH STAND BY EMPHASIZING INNOVATION AND COLLABORATION TO IMPROVE USE OUTCOMES AND PUBLIC SAFETY. CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF ONLY A FEW STATES WITHOUT AN INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT AGENCY WITH THE AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE. LOCAL MINIMUM STANDARDS AND THE EXPERTISE IN YOUTH JUSTICE TO EFFECTIVELY SERVE USE WITH COMPLEX NEEDS. IN A REALIGNED JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. FOR THIS REASON. THE LEGISLATURE PROPOSES AN OFFICE OF YOUTH JUSTICE WITH WITHIN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. WITH THIS OFFICE THE STATE WOULD CONCENTRATE ALL OF THE STATE'S YOUTH. JUSTICE FUNCTIONS INTO ONE YOU'VE SERVING AGENCY THAT WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR REGULATIONS DATA COLLECTION. RESEARCH ON BEST PRACTICES AND GRANT ADMINISTRATION. IF LEADERSHIP IS CRITICAL BECAUSE WE CAN THEN BEGIN TO BREAK DOWN THE SILOS THAT EXIST. SUPPORT LOCAL CLUB. MODERNIZE DATA COLLECTION AND INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS TO EFFECTIVELY SERVE ALL USE LOCALLY. THE MULTIPLE FUNDING PROGRAMS PROPOSED BY THE LEGISLATURE HAVE DIFFERENT PURPOSES BUT UNIVERSALLY HAVE. THE SAME GOAL OF PROVIDING COUNTIES WITH THE RESOURCES TO DEVELOP A LOCAL CONTINUUM OF CARE THAT RANGES FROM NON RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES TO LOCAL OR REGIONAL FACILITIES WITH ENHANCED TREATMENTS FOR REALIGNED USE. WITH THESE FUNDS IN SUPPORT COUNTIES CAN BUILD OUR CAPACITY TO RETAIN AND EFFECTIVELY SERVE REALIGN USE WHAT EXPANDING COMMUNITY BASED OPTIONS FOR USE WAS LOWER NEEDS. THE REAL LINES YOU FACILITIES GRANT ADDRESSES THE OBVIOUS NEED TO INCREASE LOCAL CAPACITY WITH FUNDING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE RELATED NEEDS AND IMPROVEMENTS. TO USE EXISTING LOCAL FACILITIES AS REGIONAL FACILITIES FOR GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE LONGER TERM SECURE PLACEMENTS THE FACILITIES WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO OTHER COUNTIES BASED ON CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS. THERE IS ALSO A NEED TO PROVIDE RESOURCES TO COUNTIES WERE PROBABLY SERVICE USED IN A RELAXED SYSTEM WITHIN SECURE AND NON SECURE SETTINGS. THE JUVENILE JUSTICE REALIGNMENT BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM WILL AWARD COUNTIES WITH FUNDS TO PROVIDE COUNTY BASED CARE. CUSTODY AND SUPERVISION OF ALL USED QUICKLY REALIGNED YEARS. FINALLY THERE IS A NEED TO PROVIDE TRAUMA INFORMED CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE AND EVIDENCE BASED SERVICES INCLUDING SPECIALIZED TREATMENT AND PROGRAMMING FOR HIGH NEED YOUTH. IN THE AREAS OF MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE USE AND SEX BEHAVIOR TREATMENT. THERE'S ALSO A NEED TO DEVELOP MORE DIVERSE LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE DIVERSITY OF EXPERTISE IN YOUTH DEVELOPMENT. TO BETTER SERVE YOU THAT INCLUDES GOVERNMENTAL AND NON GOVERNMENTAL STAKEHOLDERS TO USE AND COMMITTEE RESTORATION GRANT PROGRAM WILL DO THAT. OF CRITICAL ARE THE STATUTORY CHANGES TO PREVENT HARMFUL TRANSFERS OF USED TO THE ADULT SYSTEM. A DRACONIAN POLICY AND PRACTICE THAT OVERWHELMINGLY IMPACTS USE OF COLOR. ANY AGREED UPON POLICY. NEEDS TO AVOID THIS PRACTICE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS FACT NEXT JULY AS THE CLOTHES OF DJJ INTAKE WITH FINAL CLOSURE OF DJJ OCCURRING BY ATTRITION. BUT IT OPENS THE DOOR FOR INCREASED TRANSFERS TO THE ADULT SYSTEM OF USE AND DOES NOT GIVE COUNTIES ENOUGH TIME TO PREPARE FOR YOU COMING BACK FROM DJJ. AND AS WELL ASUSUAL WHO WILL HAVE DJ ELIGIBLE OFFENSES ONCE DJS CLOSED. AFTER DATE FOR CLOSURE DJJ ENDING AND TAKEN TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND A COMPLETE COMPLETE CLOSURE DATE. BACK TO DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE PROVIDES TIME FOR COUNTIES TO CREATE MEANINGFUL AND APPROPRIATE ALTERNATIVES TO DJJ IN THE ADULT SYSTEM. IT IS TIME IT IS A TIME I SUPPORTED BY LOCAL COUNTIES AND LOCAL. IN CONCLUSION IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR GET THIS RIGHT. IT'S AN IN AN EQUITABLE MANNER THAT DOES NOT SOLELY FOCUSED ON COST SAVINGS OR UNINTENTIONALLY IN DANGER USED IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. FORTUNATELY THE LEGISLATURE'S PLAN ACCOUNTS FOR MANY OF THESE ISSUES CURRENTLY IMPEDING THE STATE'S ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY SERVE USED. AND IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY NAMELY THE LACK OF VISION LEADERSHIP EXPERTISE ACCOUNTABILITY. IN OUR IN OUR FRACTURED JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM BY ESTABLISHING OVERSIGHT ENTITY WHAT THE RESEARCH DRIVEN HOW FOCUSED WE CAN BETTER SUPPORT LOCAL PROGRAMS ENSURE UNIFORM AN APPROPRIATE RESPONSES TO USE. AND MAKE BEST USE OF SCARCE STATE FUNDS WHILE REDUCING RACIAL DISPARITIES IN OUR SYSTEM THANK YOU. MONTH THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION THANKS TO ALL OF THE PANELISTS WHO ARE CARVED OUT SOME TIME ON YOUR SATURDAY MORNING TO JOIN THIS WILL. OPEN IT TO MEMBERS FROM THE COMMITTEE. CENTER MORE LOT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR HEY. SAID ON CORRECTIONS PUBLIC SAFETY IN JUDICIARY SUB FIVE WITH SENATORS. SKINNER AND BELL AND WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS SICK A LITTLE BIT OVER THE OVER THE- LAST YEAR TOO BUT- WHAT I WHAT I WAS MISSING FROM THE PRESENTATION SAYS WHAT. IS THE SEED THAT IS DRIVING THIS IDEA IT WAS- LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION REPORTER AT LA- REPORTERS STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT. ARE WE JUST LOOKING AT MAYBE SUCCESSFUL MODELS FROM OTHER STATES ALL RIGHT SO IT IS YOUR QUESTION DIRECTED TO FINANCE ABOUT WHAT WAS THE IMPETUS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO SUGGEST THE TRANSFER FROM DJJ. IN THE FIRST PLACE JUST REMIND ME I JUST COULDN'T WERE INTERESTED IN HEARING FROM MANY OF THE PRESENTATION OR FINANCE. YES SO I THINK THE IMPETUS WERE SORT OF MULTI FOLD I THINK. THE PANDEMIC PRESENTED AN OPPORTUNITY- THAT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY I'M NOT CONSIDERED POSSIBLE TO REALIGN THIS- SMALL CONTINGENT OF POPULATION STILL KEPT AT THE STATE LEVEL TO COUNTIES- THE REASON FOR DOING THAT IS THAT THE EVIDENCE HAS SHOWN THAT THEY NEED TO BETTER LOCALLY WHEN THEY'RE CLOSER TO THEIR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE STATE TOOK ON- A SIMILAR REALIGNMENT AFTER. BIRD WITH A DIFFERENT POPULATION- REALIGNING THOSE FROM DJJ AT THE TIME TO THE COUNTIES- AND POPULATION AT BOTH THE LOCAL LEVEL AND AT THE STATE LEVEL HAS DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THEN SO WE'VE WE'VE SEEN WE'VE SEEN SB A SUCCESSFUL MODEL- FOR THESE YEARS AND SO I THINK IT'S A CONTINUATION OF THAT EFFORT- THAT IS KIND OF BROUGHT US TO THIS POINT. THANK THANK YOU MISTER COLOR MORE LIKE I WOULD ADD AS I RECALL THE FIRST ACTION- THAT THE ADMINISTRATION TOOK OCCURRED BEFORE CALL OF IT. IN TERMS OF BUDGET ACTION AND ARE THERE ANY BEFORE I TURN OVER THE CITY TO SKINNER WHO'D LIKE TO ALL THE SERVICE COULD YOU HAVE A QUESTION OR DO YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO SEND MORE OUT. BOTH OKAY- I WANTED TO OPEN UP TO IF ANY OF OUR PANELISTS WHO HAVE. YOU KNOW WE HAVE A FUNDER WE HAVE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS OF ANY. BODY ON THE PANEL WOULD LIKE TO BRIEFLY RESPOND TO SENATOR MORE LOCK. IN TERMS OF- THEIR PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF THE HISTORY. OF THIS IDEA AND WHAT RESEARCH HAS BEEN DONE ANYBODY ON THE PANEL. YEAH MADAM CHAIR DOCTOR ROSS'S AT YOU YES YES IT IS I THINK OF IT THIS HAS BEEN BUILDING FOR QUITE SOME TIME BUT I THINK THE MOST RECENT- CATALYTIC MOMENT WAS IN THE GOVERNOR SHORTLY AFTER HIS INAUGURATION. WELL DECLARED HIS INTENT TO TRANSFORM THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AS WE KNOW IT. WHICH WAS ECHOING THE SENTIMENTS OF BOTH FIGHTERS LIKE THE CHILDREN FUND THEN WAS THE GROUP'S MONTH ORGANIZATION FOR QUITE SOME TIME SO THAT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT- CATALYTIC GO A MOMENT OF THE GOVERNOR MADE A DECLARATION AND NOW WE'RE GOING THIS IS LOOKING ON HOW WE MAKE GOOD. ON THAT ON THAT. WHICH IS FOLLOWED BY NUMBER OF COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE FINNEMORE LOCK BACK TO YOU YEAH THANK YOU- MR COLUMN- YOU KNOW JUST TRYING TO RESEARCH BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE. SENATOR GLORIA ROMERO DID WHAT WAS CALLED A G. R. P. A GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION PLAN WHICH- WAS SORT OF DRIVEN BY THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION AND- THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE ALSO WEIGHED IN- AND SO IT WAS A MAJOR REFORM DURING THE SCHWARZENEGGER ADMINISTRATION. AND I'M JUST WONDERING WHY DON'T WE HAVE THIS G. R. P. OR THIS THIS GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION PLAN. WITH REGARDS TO. REALIGNMENT OF DJJ. ADD THAT GOVERNOR REORGANIZATION PLANS ARE USUALLY- RELATED TO WHEN DEPARTMENTS ARE COMBINED OR TAKEN APART IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING HERE VERSUS- SORT OF SHIFTING RESPONSIBILITY- BETWEEN THE STATE AND LOCALS- WHICH HAS HAPPENED A VARIOUS POINTS IN THE PAST AS I DESCRIBE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN- WHEN THE PRIOR- USE REALIGNMENT TOOK PLACE- IN ADDITION- THE PUBLIC SAFETY REALIGNMENT TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN I BELIEVE WAS DONE WITHOUT A GOVERNOR RE ORGANIZATION PLAN SO- I DON'T THINK IT'S COMMON FOR THAT TO BE THE VEHICLE FOR MAKING THIS DECISION. SO THEN IT'S OKAY TO DO SOMETHING OF THIS. MAGNITUDE IN A BUDGET TRAILER BILL. FINNEMORE LIKELY TO MOVE YOUR MIKE LOCAL FOR PLEASE I'M SORRY MEASURES ARE. BECAUSE I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. LEAST HISTORICAL- METHODS OF HAVING TO EITHER MERGE OR ORDERS MOVE DEPARTMENT- IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE DOING IT THROUGH A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT BUDGET TRAILER BILL INSTEAD SO I'M JUST. TRYING TO SEE DO WE HAVE A MODEL. FOR HOW THIS IS DONE OR IS IT JUST. SO THAT WE'RE NOT GETTING GET THE KIND OF. WHAT I GUESS THE DETAILS THAT THE PROJECTIONS THE NARRATIVES OF WHY WE'RE WE'RE DOING THIS- BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY. REALLY THOROUGH REPORTS AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU MADE A- OPPORTUNITY FOR HEARING TODAY SO WE CAN LEARN A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT- RIGHT THAT THAT THE THAT WAS JUST THE GIST OF MY CONCERNS THANK YU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU AND MR KUSHER MORAL FROM THE L. A. L. YOU WANTED TO RESPOND AS WELL. YES I JUST WANTED TO ADD ITEMS LITTLE BIT MORE IN THE HISTORY OF THE CONCEPT OF FULLY REALIGNED DIVISION AND- THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE. IT ACTUALLY CAME UP. SEVERAL YEARS AGO AS PART OF THAT TWENTY TWELVE. TWENTY THIRTEEN BUDGET PROCESS- FULLY ALIGNED ADDITION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE IN. THIS GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AT THAT TIME. L. A. N. D. COME OUT AND- OF THE CONCEPT OF REALIGNING THE DIVISIONS YOU KNOW JUST SAYS ALTHOUGH WE DID RESIDENTS GOING TO. PROPOSAL HAPPENED STRUCTURE- BENEFITS WE HAD DONE FOR WHY. WOULD BE A GOOD SOLUTION IS IT INCREASES ACCOUNTABILITY FOR RESULTS PROMOTES FLEXIBILITY INNOVATION SEE AN INNOVATION. AND IMPROVE OUTCOMES CONSIDERATION OF LOCAL SERVICES- WE HAVE SHOWN THAT REPORT FROM TWENTY TWELVE TWENTY THIRTEEN WAS. THANK YOU THINK THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'M JUST CURIOUS MEASURES MY LAST QUESTION ARE WE DON'T HAVE DJJ IS A REPRESENTATIVE ON THE PANEL OR A SMALL RURAL COUNTY AND IT. JUST CURIOUS OF. HOW THEY'RE REACTING TO THIS PROPOSAL. OF FINANCE. WITH REGARD TO- OVER OR HOW ABOUT- CHIEF HEITMANN WHO REPRESENTS- CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER SHE REPRESENTS. OF COUNTIES OF ALL SIZES SHE FIVE MEN WOULD YOU. CARE TO WEIGH IN ON HOW YOUR YOUR SMALL COUNTY COUNTERPARTS ARE WEIGHING IN. CERTAINLY THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH ALL THE VARIETY OF- COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE- TO LOOK AT HOW WE BEST. MOVE FORWARD AND WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ON THE VARYING PROPOSALS. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT- WE ARE. GOING TO CONTINUE TO ELEVATE PRACTICES AND PROVIDE. SOME LEVEL OF STANDARDIZATION AND WE DO BELIEVE IN THESE- THE NEED FOR STRONGER OUTCOMES AND BETTER DATA BUT WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT- WE NEED TO BE VERY RESPONSIVE AND RESPECTFUL OF THE FACT THAT. WE HAVE A VARIETY OF SITUATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTY IS AND HISTORICALLY THE COUNTIES ARE BEST EQUIPPED TO LEVERAGE- ASSISTANCE AND- REGIONAL TYPE OF APPROACHES WHEN THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THAT. WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR- THERE WERE- UNIQUE NEEDS AND ABILITY TO. PARTNER AS APPROPRIATE FOR THE TYPE OF USE THAT THEIR COMMUNITY ARE SEEING AND NEED TO SERVICE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYMORE LAW I SEE. MY EX RACE FROM SENATOR SKINNER LEYVA AND BELL AND AROUSAL STARTED LISTENING TO SKINNER THANK YOU MADAMCHAIR TO- TO ADD A LITTLE TO THE CONTEXT THAT SPEND DISCUSSED SO YES THERE HAVE BEEN FIVE PASSED CONTENT BY DISCUSSIONS AROUND THE A REALIGNMENT MODEL AS WAS REFERENCE BY THE L. A. AND OBVIOUSLY THIS ACTION MANY MANY MANY YEARS AGO CURRENT. AD WHICH I DON'T REALLY RECALL I'M NOT AS FAMILIAR WITH TINY ELEVEN THE. AND THE- MOSTRI. ACTION BY THE LEGISLATURE BASED ON THE GOVERNOR OF OWN PROPOSAL WAS LAST YEAR WHEN THE GOVERNOR AS DOCTOR ROSS REFERENCED YOU REFERENCED RIGHT AFTER IS HIS INAUGURATION BUT THEN. THE GOVERNOR- MADE A CONCRETE PROPOSAL LAST YEAR WHEN HE PROPOSED TO IN HIS WORDS AND THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AS WE KNOW IT. AND MOVE A DJJ INTO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. TO FOLLOWING NEW MODEL THAT WOULD ALLOW HEALTH OFFICIALS TO MOVE TOWARDS ADDRESSING SUCH THINGS AS EARLY CHILDHOOD TRAUMA. AND THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED THAT- ACTION WE ENACTED IT TO MOVE TO MAKE THAT MOVEMENT NOW IT WAS SILENT ON THE CLOSURE OF THE STATE FACILITIES NOW NONE OF US I THINK IN THE DISCUSSIONS AND WHILE IT WASN'T NECESSARILY DEBATED ON THE FLOOR. IN THE DISCUSSIONS IN THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEES. THERE WAS DISCUSSION ABOUT DID THE ADMINISTRATION ANTICIPATE IN THIS MOVE OVER TIME POTENTIALLY CLOSING THOSE STATE FACILITIES WHICH HAS BEEN. DISCUSSED FOR MANY YEARS AND IN FACT WE HAVE FAR FEWER WE HAVE QUITE A GOOD RUN GREAT REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF YOUTH THERE ARE SERVED IN THE STATE FACILITIES AND QUITE. A SMALLER NUMBER OF THEM THAN WE HAVE IN PASSED AND SO WHILE IT WAS AN EXPLICIT IN THE ACTION THAT WE TOOK LAST YEAR. I THINK THERE WAS SOME ANTICIPATION THAT OVER TIME WITH DJJ BEING UNDER HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES THERE WOULD BE A CHANGE TO THE PRACTICE OF THE STATE RUN DJJ FACILITIES THOUGH AGAIN IT WAS NOT EXPLICIT IN THE PROPOSAL. SO NOW THIS YEAR WE ARE AS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED AND DESCRIBED FACED WITH A CHANGE WE'RE WOULD BE UNDER A REALIGNMENT MODEL AND THE REALIGNMENT MODEL BEING RATHER THAN THE- STATE DJJ FACILITIES THAT THEY WOULD BE EXPLICITLY CLOSE THAT'S EXPLICITLY IN THE PROPOSAL. AND ARE COUNTIES WOULD HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK AND I THINK THERE'S- ASISTIR ALREADY BEEN HEARD YOU KNOW MUCH. MUCH TO BE SAID FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR YOUTH BEING. HELD OR TREATED CLOSER TO HOME CLOSER TO THEIR SUPPORT SERVICES TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT. I THINK ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES BEFORE US IS. WE WILL AND I WONDER AND I WANTED TO PARTMINER FINANCE TO- RESPOND TO THIS WHY DID THE GOVERNOR MOVE AWAY FROM THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES MODEL NUMBER FOR THE ANSWER I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT. THE CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF ONLY TEN STATES. THAT HAS JUVENILE JUSTICE UNDER CORRECTIONS AND IF WE IN A FOR EXAMPLE WE MOVE STRICT PROBATION AS MUCH AS PROBATION HAS SOME VERY GOOD SERVICES IN VARIOUS COUNTIES IT IS A CORRECTIONS MODEL SO THERE'S ONLY TEN STATES WITH THAT. FORTY FORTY STATES HAVE JUVENILE. UNDER EITHER HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES- CHILD WELFARE SO I JUST WONDERED IF DEPARTMENT FINANCE ONE COMMENT WHY. THE GOVERNOR IN THE REALIGNMENT PROPOSAL MOVED AWAY FROM THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES MODEL. S. FIRST TIME THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS FORMALLY PROPOSED- A REALIGNMENT TO THE COUNTY AS WELL AS IN THE MAYOR AND UNDERLINE CIRCUMSTANCES AT THE TIME WERE SORT OF WE WERE IN THE PANDEMIC IN ONE TIME SIR DEALING WITH THE FINANCIAL. OUTCOMES OF THAT- AND IT AND IT SORT OF JUST MADE US LOOK AT OUR JUVENILE SYSTEM AND THINK ABOUT IT ARE WE USING OUR RESOURCES IN THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY- THERE AROUND EIGHT EIGHT HUNDRED USE CURRENTLY IN DJJ- MANY THERE ARE MANY LOCAL FACILITIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TODAY THAT AREN'T BEING UTILIZED- AND- COUPLE THAT WITH THE SUCCESS THAT. TOOK PLACE- IN THE PAST UNDER SIMILAR REALIGNMENTS. THEY CAME DOWN TO A SORT OF YOU KNOW. OUR IS IT BEST POSITIONED MOVING THIS OVER TO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE AT THE STATE LEVEL OR SHOULD WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT THIS AND A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT LANDS- LET'S BE AFFECTED WITH YOU AND ARE FINDING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ALLOWING THEM TO KEEP THEM CLOSE TO THE FAMILIES. COMMUNITIES ALLOW THAT SORT OF LOCAL SORT OF- DID YOU KNOW. DEVELOPMENT AND RANCH PLAN AN OLD STUFF THAT TAKE THERE THAT'S MORE DIFFICULT TO DO IT OF STATE BUT STILL AND BE BENEFICIAL- SO I THINK I SAID THAT WAS THE OVER RIDING DECISION. SORT OF AT THE TIME INCLUDING THE NEIGHBORING SO IT IS I MEAN AND I THINK THAT'S WHY SAID THAT WE SORT OF THE CREE. FACTOR THAT PUSHED TO DO A RIGHT. RIGHT NOW. AND SO I IT JUST HAD BEEN BUILT FIRST ALONG TIME AS THE L. A. O. PLAN OUT AND IT WAS WE ACTUALLY AT THE END OF BROWN ADMINISTRATION WAS PROPOSED IN TWELVE THIRTEEN SO THIS IS- HI. IT'S ALWAYS BEEN PART OF THE DISK BUT I THINK THAT IMPETUS WAS SORT OF. FISCAL AND DYNAMIC- ACTORS BUT CERTAINLY CERTAINLY HAS A LOT OF. GREAT POLICY ANGLES WHICH I THINK MAKES SENSE WHY WE THINK IT'S SUCH A GOOD PROPOSAL. PERFECT ON THAT. I'M SO I APPRECIATE YOUR EXPLANATION OF THE MOVE TO. TO HAVING IT MINISTERED ON WHY DON'T KNOW IF IT MINISTERS RIGHT WAY BUT BASICALLY THE YOUTH BEING. HANDLED ON THE COUNTY LEVEL BUT- COULDN'T THAT STILL BE ACHIEVED. S. IS PROPOSED IN THIS OTHER MODEL THROUGH HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SO STILL HAVING REALIGNMENT STILL GOING TO COUNTIES BUT HAVING IT ERA THE OVERSIGHT AND THE- GUIDANCE AND- GUIDELINES FOR IT BEING ADMINISTERED THROUGH A HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SO THAT'S REALLY QUESTION RESCUES WHY DID THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL MOVE FROM THAT BECAUSE IT COULD CONCEIVABLY AS IS PROPOSED IN THIS ALTERNATIVE YOU COULD STILL HAVE A REALIGNMENT AS THE AS YOU JUST EXPLAINED. YOU CAN STILL ACHIEVE THAT A CLOSURE OF THE STATE FACILITIES AND PROVISION OF THE YOUTH BEING HANDLED ON THE COUNTY LEVEL BUT STILL STILL THROUGH A HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES MODEL SO IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT SPECIFIC OF WHY THE- GOVERNOR MOVED AWAY FROM THAT. WELL I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE OF FACTORS HERE IS THAT ONE I THINK THEY DEMONSTRATED TRACK RECORD OF TOWNIES- PERFORMANCE AS I'VE ALREADY DESCRIBED AS SORT OF. A LOUD MOST OF US TO FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT THEY THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THIS- WITH THIS POPULATION- TOO I THINK THERE'S ARE. MANY AND THE ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN ADDED ARE MUCH MORE BROAD BASED THIS THAT. SORT OF TRANSFER RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE EIGHT HUNDRED MAYBE THE HIGHEST NEED YOUTH IN THE STATE IS GOING TO BE A DIFFICULT ENDEAVOR A BY ITSELF. AND SO SORT OF EXPANDING ON MAKING ADDITIONAL CHANGES TO OVERSIGHT AND OTHER POLICY REFORMS IN ADDITION TO THAT SEEMS TO MAYBE PUT THE PROPOSAL ACTOR AT RISK- AND SO OUR FOCUS HAS BEEN REALLY SORT OF ON. WHAT IS NECESSARY TO REALIGN THIS USED TO THE COUNTY IS AND HAVE THEM BE SUCCESSFUL THE POPULATION HAS A DEMONSTRATED OVER. THE LAST TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS SO I THINK THAT SIR THAT THE FOCUS HERE OF TRYING TO KEEP OURSELVES FOCUS ON THE REALIGNMENT CELLS- AND TRYING NOT IN TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT SUCCESSFUL. VERSUS MAKING FURTHER BROAD BASED POLICY CHANGES AND YOU KNOW WHAT MOVING OVERSIGHT ENTIRELY DIFFERENT ENTITY OR SOMETHING TO THAT AND. AND TO THAT EFFECT. I'M THANK YOU. I AM RECIPIENTS I THINK THAT THE THAT THE OBJECTIVES THAT YOU DESCRIBED CAN BE ACHIEVED IN TERMS OF THAT FIVE. THE ROLE OF THE COUNTIES STILL UNDER A UNDER AS DOCTOR ROSS EXPRESSED WITH THE WITH THE BENEFIT OF THE EXPERTISE IN YOUTH HEALTH AND WELLNESS SO I THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S ALTERNATIVE DOES IT HAVE A GOOD JOB OF ACHIEVING. YOU KNOW WE WERE WE WERE THROWN AND I DON'T MEAN THROW THAT OKAY WE WERE GIVEN SOMETHING AT THE MAY REVISED TO SWITCH FROM LAST YEAR AND IN THIS SHORT TIME IN TRYING TO RESPECT A DESIRE TO GO WITH THE REALIGNMENT MODEL STILL TRYING TO REACH. THAT PRINCIPLE THAT WE AGREED WITH FROM THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL LAST YEAR OF GOING THROUGH THE HEALTH AND WELLNESS LENS SO I THINK THE LEGISLATURE'S PROPOSAL HAS GREAT BENEFIT FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE THANK YOU SENATOR LEYVA. THANK YOU MADAM BUDGET SHARE- I JUST WANT TO THINK OF DOCTOR ROSS AND MR USMAN- ONE FOR THEIR PRESENTATIONS AND TO FOR YOUR DEDICATION TO THIS POPULATION. THESE ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN SOCIETY TODAY AND I THINK THAT MR GOODMAN WHAT YOU SAID THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THE LATE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO GET THIS RIGHT. COULD NOT BE MORE TRUE THESE PEOPLE NEED US AND THE L. A. O. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL- CREATING MORE ACCOUNTABILITY I THINK THAT'S GREAT. BECAUSE WE CANNOT LET THIS BE A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS THAT IS FOR GOTTEN THEY NEED MORE RESOURCES THEY NEED MORE ACCESS. I KNOW THE PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN AND EVEN PART OF THE LEGISLATURE'S PLAN. PUTS THESE YOUNG PEOPLE CLOSER TO THEIR FAMILIES BUT I THINK THAT WE JUST CAN'T EVER FORGET THAT SOMETIMES A FAMILY IS A PROBLEM- WE ALL LEARN WHAT WE LIVE FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE AND MANY TIMES THESE YOUNG PEOPLE. ARE BROUGHT UP IN A SITUATION THAT. MAKES THEM WHO THEY ARE AND SOMETIMES PUTTING THEM BACK IN THE FAMILY SITUATION IS ONLY GOING TO MAKE THE SITUATION WORSE. SO I THINK- DOCTOR ROSS AND EXCUSE ME AGAIN FOR YOUR DEDICATION AND- WE DO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO GET THIS RIGHT BECAUSE THESE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE COUNTING ON US THANK YOU ADVENTURE. THANK YOU SENATOR BILL. THANK YOU EVERYBODY I WANTED TO SPEAK- AFTER SIX YEARS OF BUDGET SUB FIVE WORKING ON AUG JUVENILE JUSTICE. ISSUES AND GIVE MY PERSPECTIVE OF THE DIRECTION THAT WE NEED TO GO AND ON THIS ISSUE I'M JUST GOING TO ASK THAT YOU BE BRIEF SENATOR BILL WE'VE GOT A TIGHT TIME FRAME THANK YOU. YEAH I WILL BE. THE FIRST THING I THINK WE NEED TO DO TO ADD TO THIS IS THE WE HAVE TO HAVE THE ASUS- ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES- SCREENING MANDATE THAT IS RECOMMENDED BY. DR NADINE BURKE HARRIS AND HER- WORK THAT SHE'S DONE AND THE BABY HUNDRED POINTS CLINICS. AND FINDING OUT OF THE SUCCESS OF LOOKING AT- CHILDREN'S HEALTH. FROM A PERSPECTIVE OF- TRAUMA THAT OCCURRED THE SECOND THING I THINK WE NEED TO DO IS INCLUDE WRAPAROUND- FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS. FOR ALL OUT REACH OUT TO. AT RESCUES- WE ALSO ARE HAVE A UNDERSTANDING OF THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION'S OR THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS- SCHOOLS FOR JUVENILE OFFENDERS- AND THE SPECIAL EDUCATION PROGRAM NEEDS OF THOSE STUDENTS I SUPPORT. OF THE SMALL THERAPEUTIC- FACILITIES- IS SPEND STARTED ALL OVER THE COUNTRY THE MISSOURI MODEL HAS BEEN- PROVEN IN MANY STATES TO BE MORE ACCEPTABLE THOSE FACILITIES ARE SMALLER THERAPEUTIC FACILITIES I THINK THE DIRECTION WE HAVE NEEDS TO GO IN THAT DIECTION IS THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE MODELS OF MENTAL HEALTH MODEL YOU CAN TREAT DRUG ABUSE AND% NOT TREATMENT. AND I JUST WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR MY OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE ON- BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS- AND I HOPE THAT THESE ARE INCLUDED THIS PUT NEED DOESN'T WERE IT SHOULD GOING THE DIRECTION OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL WE NEED TO WORK ON IT MORE AND FILL IN THE GAPS ON EARLY INTERVENTION TREATMENT THAT WILL BE FUNDED- WHERE'S FEDERAL MATTER MEDICAID FUNDS- PISD CHIEF FUNDS. THOSE FUNDS ARE MATCH WHEN THEY'RE IN IN FACILITIES WERE NOT ALLOWED TO USE THOSE FUNDS SO OUR STATE FACILITIES CHARGE- THE COST OF THE STATE FACILITIES ARE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR- THE AVERAGE COST OF THE STATE COUNTY JUVENILE FACILITY IS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF A HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR- WE NEED WE NEED TO GET A JOB THAT MONEY IS BETTER AND MORE WISELY- I THINK THE DIRECTION OF. THE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL- NEEDS TO BE INSISTED UPON AND I AGREE SENATOR SCANNERS COMMENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR. BILL CENTER DORADO. THANK MAN TO YOU. OF ALL DAY PICKED THE PANELISTS AND ASK THEM THIS QUESTION IF TO FIGHT MEANT AND MS GASKINS. IF YOU COULD SAY IN A VERY SHORT WAY. OF WHICH OPTION YOU ARE ADVOCATING FOR. AND GIVE ME ONE OR TWO COMPELLING REASONS AS TO WHY IT HAS TO BE THAT WHAT NEEDS TO BE OR SHOULD BE THAT OPTION. Q. FIVE WE WILL START WITH YOU. THANK YOU- WELL I REALLY DON'T FEEL LIKE WE'RE IN A POSITION TO CHOOSE ONE OR THE OTHER OPTION I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT- THE JUVENILE PROBATION DEPARTMENTS ARE NOT SOLELY A CORRECTIONS MODEL AWARENESS NOT SOLELY AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES MODEL WE ARE VERY UNIQUE CAN WE LEVERAGE OUR BOTH OF THOSE- AS SIDES OF THE EXPERTISE. AND PUTS US IN A UNIQUE POSITION BUT- WE WILL NEED WITH THE RESOURCES TO MAKE THIS A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION AND I CAN'T REITERATE ENOUGH- THAT WE AGREE THIS IS A SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO GET RIGHT- THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT FROM THE LANDS OF WHAT IS BEST FOR THE USE. AND ASKED THAT QUESTION REPEATEDLY THAT A BUILDING ANY ANY ADDITIONAL CHANGES THAT IMPACT THE LARGER SYSTEMATIC TIME WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO REALIGN THIS COMPLEX OUR POPULATION- COULD JEOPARDIZE THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ON IN SENATOR ALTHOUGH I THINK THE CDF IS MOST CONCERNED THAT THIS PROCESS IS CENTERED AROUND THE CURRENT AND LONG TERM WELL BEING OF YOU AND WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY CHANGES MUST INCLUDE COMMUNITY INPUT AND OVERSIGHT THAT'S FOCUSED ON HEALTH AND THE WELL BEING OF USED TO BE DONE SUCCESSFULLY AND SO I THINK THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT WE WANT TO SEE HAPPEN AND WE KNOW THAT WE WILL CONTINUE. TO USE A GREAT MINDS THAT ARE HERE TO GET THAT DONE THANK YOU. DURAZO SENATOR MINING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PANEL MEMBERS SIN. ADMINISTRATION CONTRIBUTIONS I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE GOVERNOR'S COMMITMENT TO THIS I THINK OUR CHALLENGE IS GETTING IT RIGHT. I THINK THE BROAD OBJECTIVE IS DECRIMINALIZATION LOOKING TO CAUSES TREATMENT AND EMPOWERMENT OF YOUTH I HAD SOME QUESTIONS BUT IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I THINK I'LL JUST OFFER A COUPLE OF MORE OBSERVATIONS- I AGREE WITH SENATOR BELL'S COMMENTS ALSO SENATOR LEYVA. THAT FAMILIES OFTEN THE SOURCE OF TRAUMA. AND NEEDS TO BE EITHER INCLUDED OR IDENTIFIED AS TO WHAT IS BEST FOR THAT AT RISK YOUTH I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES I KNOW WE FACE IN THE COMMUNITIES I REPRESENT. IS INSUFFICIENT NUMBER OF TRAINED PSYCHIATRISTS- CULTURALLY SENSITIVE. PSYCHIATRISTS PSYCHOLOGISTS THERAPISTS. AND I THINK WE SHOULD PARTNER ON THIS INITIATIVE WITH EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS TO FURTHER INCENTIVIZE YOUNG PEOPLE PURSUING TRAINING. TO SUPPORT THEIR COMMUNITIES AS PROFESSIONALS WHO MIGHT BE BI LINGUAL MULTI LINGUAL- OR CULTURALLY SENSE IT ALONG WITH THAT WOULD BE PEER SUPPORT- IN THE THERAPY MODALTIES- I WOULD NOT I'M ALSO GLAD TO SEE THAT BOTH PROPOSALS. SUPPORT NOT MAINTAINING THE PINE GROVE YOUTH CONSERVATION CAMP. I WOULD ALSO THINK WE MIGHT WANNA LOOK AT PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS AS WELL AS A POSSIBLE PATHWAY FOR SOME USED TO WORK WITH OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE UNDER APPROPRIATE SUPERVISION- TO DEVELOP SKILLS AND CAREER PATHWAYS SO MORE A COMMENTARY MADAM CHAIR THAN THAN A QUESTION. BUT I DO THINK. THE ISSUE OF RESOURCES IF WE ARE GOING TO INVEST IN SOME OF THE TRAUMA IDENTIFICATION AND TREATMENT AS SENATOR BELL IDENTIFIED THE ACES RESEARCH AND WORK AND SUCCESSES. THE FUNDING NEEDS TO ALSO BE SUFFICIENT. TO INVOLVE THOSE PROFESSIONALS WHO CAN PROVIDE SUPPORT. TO THE AT RISK YOUTH SO AGAIN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH US IN AMMAN IN APPRECIATED TWO QUICK QUESTIONS FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IF YOU COULD TELL US I THINK I HEARD SOMEONE EARLIER SAID THAT THE CURRENT- POPULATION DJJ WAS EIGHT HUNDRED BUT I WANTED TO CONFIRM THAT AND SECOND WHAT'S THE CURRENT OPERATING EXPENDITURES FOR DJJ. AS OF LAST WEEK AS THE POPULATION WAS AT SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE AND THE TOTAL BUDGET IS A LITTLE OVER TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. THANK YOU I THINK THAT AGAIN THIS IS WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS AROUND OVERSIGHT NOT A BET AND ACCOUNTABILITY IT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT THAT WE- ARE CLEAR ABOUT DATA REPORTING OUTCOME METRICS ASSOCIATED. WITH THE FUNDING IN EACH PROPOSAL- AS WELL AS. OUR BEST A GAS AND PER ARE PAUL OUT XP. BOMB OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE- WHO HAVE BEEN- A REFER TO DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE WELL THIS IS THE BUDGET COMMITTEE CAME TO A BUDGET PROPOSAL WE ARE ASKING THE FINANCE QUESTIONS BUT THAT SHOULDN'T BE. INTERPRETED AS- OUR DESIRE TO SAVE MONEY AT THEIR EXPENSE THIRTY NIELSEN YOU A QUESTION. YES I DO MADAM CHAIR OBSERVATION. QUESTION THE THERE'S A GIRL THERE WAS A WELL TALENTED REORGANIZATION OF THE AGENCIES OF GOVERNMENT. THIS CALL BLOW UP THE BOXES. TO MY- THE KNOWLEDGE THE ONLY BOX THAT REALLY GOT BLOWN UP WAS A DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. AT THE TIME THAT AGENCY IT WAS TOP LIGHT AND BOTTOM HEAVY MEANING THEY DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH THE MANAGERIAL. STAFF THE GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED. INDIRECT THIS THAT I THINK AROUND FIVE BILLION DOLLAR. ORGANIZATION THE PRODUCT OF THAT WAS THEN AN ORGANIZATION THAT BECAME BOTH TOP HEAVY AND BOTTOM HEAVY. NOTHING MUCH CHANGE. NOW THIS IS AN AREA WHERE THERE MAY WELL BE SOME HOPE JUST YESTERDAY I TALKED TO CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER CEO OF SACRAMENTO COUNTY. AND BASED ON PRIOR EXPERIENCE I'VE BEEN WARY ABOUT THIS. CHANGE PROPOSED THE EGGMAN OF JUVENILE OFFENDERS NOW BEING REMANDED TO THE COUNTIES. THE HIS REMARKS DID COMFORT ME SOME. BOB HI THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE IN THIS SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE REALIGNMENT. WILL ONLY WORK IF RESOURCES FOLLOW. CALORIES DO NOT AND WILL NOT IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE HAVE MANY RESOURCES IN FACT THEY'RE IN DIRE STRAITS RIGHT NOW. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WILL THERE BE IS THERE A PLAN FOR SOME LONG TIME A LONG LONG TERM SUSTAINING OF FUNDING TO HELP THIS TRANSITION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE TO THE AUTHORITY OF COUNTY PROBATION. YES PROPOSAL INCLUDES- TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS HER USE- PER YEAR AND SO WE GET TO FULL IMPLEMENTATION INCLUDES A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR MINIMUM. FOR COUNTIES AND IN TOTAL UPON FULL IMPLEMENTATION WEEKS THOSE TO BE. TO BE OVER TWO HUNDRED AND TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS- AND IN TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. ALLOWS FOR SOME GROSS TO THAT FUNDING- AND JUST FOR NOTED THAT HE HAD A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN OUR ORIGINAL NAY REVISION PROPOSAL- WHICH IS CONTEMPLATED ON SORT OF. BEING ABLE TO ADD PEOPLE ON THE MARGINS MAYBE YOU KNOW LESS COSTLY BUT AFTER HAVING DISCUSSION WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS AND HAS BEEN DISCUSSED TODAY- IT'S A HIGH NEED POPULATION WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT. COUNTY IS OUR RESOURCE PROPERLY TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THEM ON SO- I REVISED PROPOSAL REFLECTS THAT- AND WE DO THINK. IT'S SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT. I'M GLAD THAT ON YOUR AND WILL BE FOR OUR BUDGET COMMITTEE BE VERY CLOSELY SCRUTINIZING THIS TRANSITION. NOW YESTERDAY I HAD A NICE CONVERSATION WITH THE- CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER SERIAL. AND AGAIN AS I SAY HE COMFORTED ME SOME ABOUT THEIR PLANS FOR THIS TRANSITION. I DID NOT ASK THIS QUESTION KNOWN MAYBE THIS WOULD BE FOR CHIEF HEIGHTENED. WHAT WAS LEFT THEN IN THE JUVENILE FACILITIES OF THE STATE WORDS OF THE MORE DIFFICULT. WARDS THE ONES WHO WERE BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS. IN CUSTODY IN OUT OF CUSTODY. THIS IS A MORE DIFFICULT POPULATION HOW ARE YOU ARE YOU ANTICIPATING DIFFERENT STRATEGIES TO DEAL WITH THIS MORE OR LESS AMENABLE. POPULATION AS A NOW COME INTO YOUR AUTHORITIES IN THE COUNTIES. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THAT QUESTION- YES YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THESE ARE THE HIGHEST NEED- A USE WITHIN OUR SYSTEM WITH SOME VERY COMPLEX NEEDS AND WE'VE ALREADY BEGUN DISCUSSIONS- MONTHS- THE DIVERSE COUNTIES WITH OUR COLLABORATIVE PARTNERS I'VE BEEN SPEAKING WITH OUR- COUNTY EDGED EDUCATE OUR COUNTY DIRECTOR OF EDUCATION ARE- MIDDLE HEALTH DIRECTOR WHO SETS ON OUR JUVENILE JUSTICE DISCORDANT IN COUNCIL- AS WELL AS ALL OF THE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS IN THE COMMUNITY THAT PARTICIPATE. AND HAVE A VOICE IN OUR LOCAL SYSTEM AND I'M SURE THAT'S GOING TO BE TRUE FOR EACH- CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER THAT THEY WILL NEED TO WORK WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF STAKEHOLDERS COMMUNITY PARTNERS GOVERNMENT PARTNERS HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES I HAVE TO PUT TOGETHER THE ALL OF THE RESEARCH ALL OF THE DATA. THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO US ARTISTIC DEMONSTRATES HOW WE CAN BEST SERVE THESE INDIVIDUALS AND WE KNOW THAT SOME OF THEM HAVE A VERY HIGH MEDICAL NEEDS AND WE HAVE SOME WITH US SEXUAL. BEHAVIORS THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED SO WE MAY NEED TO USE- SOME. ALL CONTRACTING MONTHS WITH VARIOUS. FOR BERRIES. NEEDS WHERE'S OTHER USE WILL BE ABLE TO SPEAK SERVED- IN THEIR THEIR LOOK LOCAL A COMMUNITY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK AT. WHAT IS AVAILABLE IN EACH COMMUNITY WHAT THEY'VE SHOWN TO BE HAVE THEIR STRENGTHS WITHIN AND WHAT COMMUNITY RESOURCES AND PARTNERSHIPS THAT THEY CAN LEVERAGE BUT THIS IS NOT A NEW- SITUATION FOR US THIS IS. THE TYPE OF A COLLABORATION THAT HAS SERVED US WELL IN THE PAST AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO I REALLY HAVE TO LEAN ON AND LEVERAGE ALL OF THOSE PARTNERSHIPS. THANK YOU FOR THAT THE LITTLE WHILE AGO MY COLLEAGUE FROM BERKELEY. OBSERVE SOMETHING THAT REALLY TUGS AT MY HEARTSTRINGS. I FOUND THAT THE COMMONALITY AND MOST CRIMINAL OFFENDERS. IS PLUGS ALCOHOL. BUT ALSO A TOUGHER ONE TO DEAL WITH WHAT I CALL THE BROKEN HEART. THIS IS PARTICULARLY SO FOR OUR YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS. IT WAS A FAMILY THAT DIDN'T WORK THEY DIDN'T GET NURTURED THEY DID NOT GET LOVED SUPPORTED. THIS TIME THIS BROKEN HEART BEGINS IN THE WOMB. TEN YEARS AGO ASK COULD BAND DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT. TO RECITE SOME OF THE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS WHICH- HE PROCEEDED TO DO. I THEN INQUIRED WILL WHAT DO YOU HAVE. TO HELP WITH THE BROKEN HEART. IT WAS VERY DISTURBING BECAUSE THE BLACK LOOK THAT I'VE BEEN RECEIVED TOLD ME ALL I NEEDED NO THEY WEREN'T REALLY LOOKING AT THE BROKEN HEART. IS THAT AN AREA THAT YOU FEEL HAVE. HE FIRED SOMEONE THAT YOU CAN. BEEF UP OR DO ADDITIONAL WORK WITH THAT BROKEN HEART AND THAT USE THAT NEVER EVEN HAD A CHANCE. ABSOLUTELY AND I APPRECIATE YOU MENTIONING SHE CO I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THE WORK THAT HE DOES- WITHIN SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND- FEEL THAT HE IS A LEADER IN THIS AREA AND I KNOW HE TOO IS LOOKING AT THE AREA- TRAUMA INFORMED CARE AND WE- HAVE. GROWN BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS- IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF EMBEDDING ON TRAUMA INFORMED CARE THROUGHOUT OUR OUR WORK WHETHER IT'S DIVERSION AND PREVENTION AS WELL AS THOSE USE THAT ARE IN DETENTION- I AM VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT. THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING WITH THE USE LOCALLY AND I KNOW OTHER CHIEFS FEEL THE SAME. THE EFFORTS THAT WE'RE MAKING TO ESTABLISH MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIPS WHICH EACH WITH EACH OF THE YEARS AND HELPED THEM- REALLY COME INTO THEMSELVES AND HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR STRENGTHS AND WHO THEY ARE AS AN INDIVIDUAL AND BE ABLE TO BUILD WITH EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES AS WELL AS AS- MENTAL HEALTH AND COUNSELING RESOURCES. TO HELP THEM BE THE BEST PERSON AND THEY CAN BE- WE CAN ONLY DO THAT WELL WITH PROPER RESOURCES AND BY LEVERAGING JEAN ALL OF THE DIFFERENT- SCIENCE AND RESEARCH THAT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. AND I DEFINITELY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO DO WE NEED TO DO IT FOR EACH YEAR. AND WE NEED TO LEAVE LOOK AT EACH USER INDIVIDUALLY AND CREATE AN INDIVIDUALIZED PLAN FOR THEM. VERY GOOD. OF WOULD THAT BE LIKE AN I EP IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE CONTEMPLATING FOR OR MAYBE YOU ALREADY HAVE THAT. APPLICABLE FOR. I'M SORRY RENDERED EDUCATION PLAN OR INDIVIDUAL REVILLA KATIE PLANS IS THE U. DRAFT THOSE FOR EACH WARD. ABSOLUTELY AND FOR THOSE USE THAT HAVE NOT YET COMPLETED- THEIR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR COUNTY EDUCATION DEPARTMENT- AND ADDS A TREMENDOUS SPECIAL ED RESOURCES WITHIN OUR FACILITY- BUT INTENTIONALLY FOR THE POPULATION THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND MANY OF THEM ON OUR ON THE OLDER END OF THE POPULATION THAT WE WORK WITH. SO WE WILL NEED TO GO BEYOND THAT EDUCATIONAL PLAN FOR THEIR HIGH SCHOOL BUT WE WOULD WE WOULD BE LOOKING TOO LITTLE- WHAT SECONDARY- OPTIONS ARE THERE ARE THEY SOMEONE THAT- WE CAN GET INVOLVED AND- PURSUING- EDUCATION THROUGH A LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND A UNIVERSITY OF OCCASIONAL- PROGRAM AND THAT PART OF THE WORK REALLY TAPS INTO GETTING TO KNOW THAT USE UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEIR- THEIR STRENGTHS ARE WHAT BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WHAT THEIR AREA OF. INTEREST ARE AND WHERE WE CAN TAP INTO THEIR PASSION AND CONNECT THEM TO THE RESOURCES THAT ALLOWS THEM- TO SEE A BETTER FUTURE FOR THEMSELVES RIGHT NOW WE HAVE USED OUR FACILITY THAT ARE WORKING ONLINE I'M TOWARDS THEIR COLLEGE EDUCATIONS BUT WE ALSO HAVE YOU THAT ARE EXPLORING- THEY'RE STILL IN THAT EXPLORATION PHASE THAT ARE I'M TRYING OUT A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT THINGS- TO. ESTABLISH THEIR PATH FORWARD AND THE INDIVIDUALIZED PLAN NEEDS TO BEING NOT ONLY FOR THEIR EDUCATION- BUT A TOTAL INDIVIDUALIZED PLAN FOR THEIR FOR THEIR TREATMENT- FOR WHAT THEIR PLANS ARE- AS WE MOVE TOWARDS- FREE ENTRY INTO THE COMMUNITY- WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO RESIDE MANY OF THEM WILL BE- PERHAPS- MOVING INTO MORE INDEPENDENT LIVING- RATHER THAN RETURNING TO THEIR HOME ENVIRONMENTS SO THERE ARE MANY SKILLS. AND OPERA TRINITY'S TO REALLY AND THERE UNDER. OF WHAT THE ACHIEVE.
