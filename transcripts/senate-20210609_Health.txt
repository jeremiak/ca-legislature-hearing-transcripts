SENATORS TODAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT EIGHTY THREE EIGHTY ONE. I WANT TO THANK COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF ON THIS BILL. WELL I STAYED HAS HAD TO DEAL WITH THE GLOBAL HEALTH PANDEMICS UNLIKE WE'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE. IT CANNOT BE LOST THAT PRIOR TO COPE IN NINETEEN. THERE WAS ANOTHER HEALTH EPIDEMIC SWEEPING OUR STATE. I'M OF COURSE TALKING ABOUT THE BATTLE WITH OPIOIDS. ACCORDING TO THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL THERE WERE OVER EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND DRUG OVERDOSE DEATHS NATIONALLY BETWEEN MAY TWENTY NINETEEN. AND MAY TWENTY TWENTY. THOSE WHO ARE BATTLING THEIR ADDICTION TO THESE DRUGS ARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE CLASS OF VICTIMS IN ORANGE COUNTY WE HAVE HEARD A DRUG DEALERS SELLING NARCOTICS NEAR THE GROUNDS OF DRUG TREATMENT FACILITIES. OR WORSE MILITAR CONTEXT TO THEM. TO HELP COMBAT THIS EPIDEMIC ON MARCH FIFTH TWENTY NINETEEN THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE AGENCY. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICE ISSUED INFORMATION NOTICES NINETEEN DASH ZERO ZERO NINE. THE FORMAL NOTICE NOW IT'S THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC AN AUTHORIZED DRUG TREATMENT FACILITIES TO POSSESS AND USE THE LOCKS ON ON SITE. WHEN NEEDED HOWEVER THIS NOTICE DID NOT REQUIRE DRUG TREATMENT FACILITIES TO PURCHASE. NOR CAN OR HAVE A STAFF MEMBER TRAINED IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF NALOXONE ONSITE AT ALL TIMES. EIGHTY THREE EIGHTY ONE IS A SIMPLE MEASURE MEANT TO EXPAND THAT FORMAL NOTICE BY REQUIRING DRUG TREATMENT CENTERS TO ACTUALLY CARRY. AT LEAST TWO DOSES OF OVERDOSE MEDICATION ON SITE LET'S HAVE A STAFF MEMBER TRAINED HOW TO ADMINISTER IT. IN CLOSING I BELIEVE THIS IS A COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO LITERALLY BEING. THE TOOL TO SAVE THE LIVES OF AVAILABLE CLASS OF PEOPLE. WITH THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS FOR DH CS ON THE COMMITTEE THE BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I VOTE. WITH ME HERE TODAY VIA PHONE IS JOHN TO FRESHLY WITH THE SAN DIEGO DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANKS VERY MUCH THANK YOU RESEARCH AREAS YES OKAY WE HAVE FOUND THE FIRST YEAR READY ON THE LINE RIGHT A POLICE BEGAN- TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU SO MUCH- THE TENDERS. MY NAME IS SHANTI PRECIO A PROSECUTOR AT THE CENTRE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WHERE I SERVE AS THE ASSISTANT CHIEF OF OUR MAJOR NARCOTICS DIVISION. I'M HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF A. B. THREE EIGHT ONE. ONE OF OUR AREAS OF FOCUS IS THE PROTECTION OF CHEMICALLY DEPENDENT NARCOTICS USERS WHO ARE INJURED BECAUSE OF THE INFLUX OF DANGEROUS OPIOIDS INCLUDING FENTANYL WHICH IS FIFTY TO ONE HUNDRED TIMES MORE POTENT THAN MORPHINE. YOUR DESK ARE SKYROCKETING IN OUR NATION ESPECIALLY DURING THIS CURRENT PANDEMIC. FOR THE TROUBLING TRENDS WE'VE SEEN INVOLVES A RISE IN OVERDOSES AND DRUG TREATMENT FACILITIES. ASIANS RECEIVING TREATMENT AT THE CENTERS FIND WAYS TO ACCESS OPIOIDS. THE RISK OF OVERDOSE IS ESPECIALLY HIGH WITHIN THESE FACILITIES THAT PATIENT DRUG TOLERANCE DECREASES AFTER PERIODS OF SOBRIETY. THIS RISK IS COMPOUNDED BY THE FACT THAT SENTINEL QUIETLY CONTAMINATES THE ILLICIT DRUG SUPPLY. MOST COMMONLY WE'VE SEEN IT DEADLY COUNTERFEIT OXY CODE ON PILLS S. AS PURE FENTANYL. NALOXONE ALSO KNOWN AS IN OUR CANDIDATE CHEAP AND EFFECTIVE DRUG THAT REVERSES THE EFFECTS OF AN OPIOID OVERDOSE. QUITE SIMPLY IT SAVES LIVES WITH A SIMPLE SQUARE IN THE NOSE. THE VERY FIRST RECOMMENDATION ARE CDC PROVIDE AS IT RELATES TO OPIOID OVERDOSE MEDICATION IS TO QUOTE. EXPAND DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF NALOXONE AN OVERDOSE PREVENTION EDUCATION ENCLOSED. STATES SUCH AS CONNECTICUT MASSACHUSETTS WISCONSIN AND NEW MEXICO HAVE CODIFIED THE MANDATORY DISTRIBUTION OF NALOXONE TUBAL NORMAL PATIENTS. WE SHOULD DO THE SAME BY REQUIRING THAT DRUG TREATMENT FACILITIES POSSESS TO UNEXPIRED DOSES OF NALOXONE SO THEY CAN EFFECTIVELY TREAT THEIR MOST VULNERABLE PATIENTS ON THE VERGE OF DEATH. AB THREE EIGHT ONE WILL SAVE LIVES. BECAUSE OF THAT I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.

OKAY SO THE EXAMS I'M NUMBER FOUR EIGHTY FOUR THIRTY NINE BY SOME MEMBER BERIKAN. RIGHT WELCOME THANK YOU THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TODAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT AN EIGHTY FOUR THIRTY NINE A SIMPLE YET MEANINGFUL ADDITION TO ONE WORD IN THE CODE THAT THE NON BINARY GENDER OPTION ON DEATH CERTIFICATES THE LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY AND PARTICULARLY THE TRANS AND NON BINARY INDIVIDUALS HAVE LONG WRONG LONG FOUGHT FOR RECOGNITION AND EQUALITY UNDER THE LAW. AT THIS VERY MOMENT THEIR RIGHTS ARE BEING ATTACKED ACROSS THE COUNTRY WITH BANDS ON VITAL HEALTHCARE AND SPORTS PARTICIPATION IN MANY OTHER STATES. I AM SO PROUD TO BE A PART OF THIS LEGISLATURE IT IS MADE CALIFORNIA A LEADER IN PROTECTING LGBTQ PLUS PEOPLE AND THEIR RIGHTS TO LIVE IS THEIR FULL SELVES. PROTEIN ATKINS HAS LONG LED THIS FIGHT WITH THE B. FIFTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN GUARANTEEING THAT SEX WOULD REFLECT GENDER IDENTITY ON DEATH CERTIFICATES. THAT'S THE ONE SEVENTY NINE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHICH ALLOWED CALIFORNIANS TO IDENTIFY AS MALE FEMALE OR NON BINARY. ON BIRTH CERTIFICATES DRIVER'S LICENSE IN COURT DOCUMENTS. THIS BILL EIGHTY FOUR THIRTY NINE BUILDS ON THIS CRITICAL WORK BY ADDING NON BINARIES AN OPTION ON DEATH CERTIFICATES. INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT IDENTIFY AS MALE OR FEMALE ARE CONSTANTLY FORCED TO JUSTIFY THEIR EXISTENCE AND ARE DENIED THEIR OWN IDENTITY EVEN IN DEATH. PRONOUNS IN GENDERED LANGUAGE MATTER NON BINARY YOUTH WHO REPORTED THEIR PROGRAMS WERE NOT RESPECTED BY THOSE IN THEIR LIVES WERE TWICE AS LIKELY TO ATTEMPT SUICIDE AS THOSE WHOSE CORRECT PRONOUNS WERE USED. SUICIDE RATES AMONGST NON BINARY USE QUADRUPLE THOSE OF THEIR PEERS AFFIRMING LANGUAGE ON DEATH CERTIFICATES IS ALL THE MORE ESSENTIAL BECAUSE OF THIS. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OR TAMMY MARTIN LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR QUALITY CALIFORNIA AND SAM BRINTON ADVOCATE WITH THE TREVOR PROJECT.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS EIGHTY FOUR FIFTY ONE WILL REMOVE BARRIERS IN CURRENT LAW TO ENSURE AN INDIVIDUAL SEEKING EMERGENCY PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES HAS TIMELY ACCESS TO THE DISHING CARE. AND SERVICES THAT MAY BE NEEDED. WHY MANY OTHER. INDIVIDUALS IN A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS MAY SEEK CARE AT A NEAREST EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. AFTER EVALUATION BY AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN SOME INDIVIDUALS NEED ADDITIONAL PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES. AND REQUIRE TRANSFERRED TO A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL. HOWEVER EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS HAVE EXPERIENCED TROUBLE TRANSFERRING PATIENTS TO PSYCHIATRIC FACILITIES. THAT DO NOT MAINTAIN AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. THERE IS A CONCERN THAT SOME PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS ARE USING LANGUAGE IN CURRENT LAW. WHICH ONLY APPLIES TO CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS. THAT MAINTAIN AND OPERATE AN E. D. AS A WAY TO NOT ACCEPT ALL PATIENTS OFTEN BASED ON THEIR PERCEIVED INABILITY TO PAY. IF A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL AVOIDS TAKING PATIENTS IT LIMITS ACCESS TO CARE AND REDUCES CAPACITY OF ALREADY SCARCE MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES. CARE SHOULD BE ACCESSIBLE TO ALL PATIENTS FACING AN EMERGENCY MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS REGARDLESS OF THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. EIGHTY FOUR FIFTY ONE PROVIDES A CRITICAL IMPROVEMENTS TO PATIENT ACCESS TO PSYCHIATRIC TRANSFERS BY REQUIRING ALL HOSPITALS TO ACCEPT HIGHER LEVEL PSYCHIATRIC TRANSFERS REGARDLESS OF A PATIENT'S ABILITY TO PAY. I'M JOINED TODAY BY TEN MADDEN LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS AND TERRA GAMBLE EASTMAN OF THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE.

PLEASE PRESS ONE THING THERE ARE NOW. AND AT THIS TIME OF YEAR WE HAVE NO ONE IN Q. OKAY THANKS VERY MUCH MODERATOR LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE OR THE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS US. SENATOR ADMIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I GUESS I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE A DOCTOR RANDALL A- AN OPPORTUNE TO RESPOND TO THE OPPOSITION- BUT I WOULD CERTAINLY SAY. THAT I THINK I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT WE NEED TO WORK REALLY HARD. TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF BED SPACE THAT WE HAVE ACROSS OUR ENTIRE SYSTEM. AND THE WHOLE SYSTEM NEEDS A REHABBING AND I THINK THIS IS A WAY TO BE ABLE TO BEGIN. HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS THAT NEED TO BE GOING. ON GOING SO I LIKE TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE JUST TO RESPOND TO THAT BUT ALSO- LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL. WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT AND- AND THIS IS IN SOME RESPECTS REMINDS ME OF A BILL THAT I WORKED ON FOR YEARS BUT COULD NEVER MOVE VERY FAR WAS. THE IDEA OF A BED REGISTRY ACTUALLY KNOWING OR PSYCHIATRIC BEDS ARE- BUT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF RESISTANCE TO HAVE PEOPLE PUTTING THAT WHICH SEEMS PRETTY BASIC ONLINE- SO. IN MOVING THE BILL I WOULD ASK DOCTOR RANDALL IF YOU'D LIKE TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE OPPOSITION ABOUT IT BEING TOO MUCH AT THIS TIME. OKAY SO THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED BY CENTER ADMIN AND- THE- THE SELLER AND RANDALL WHICH LIKE THE ANSWER. THANK YOU AND IT'S GREAT TO SEE THE DOCTOR RECOMMEND ON THE RED CARPET I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I SEE YOU IN YOUR NEWPOSITION AND JUST WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU FOR THAT. FIRST AND FOREMOST C. B. H. T. A.'S OPPOSITION APPEARS TO BE BUDGETARY IN NATURE. IT'S MORE FOCUSED ON. HOW WE REACH THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF LACK OF BED SPACE. RATHER THAN THE POLICY THAT THIS BILL IS ATTEMPTING TO SOLVE. WHICH IS IF THERE IS A HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE. ARE WE ABLE TO TRANSFER THAT PATIENT BASED ON THAT PLEASE. WHICH IS THE REAL TEST. OF THE POLICY THAT'S BEFORE YOU HERE TODAY. THANK YOU MR GROVE. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND I KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN PREVIOUS VERSIONS IN THIS BILL- OVER THE PAST YEARS HAVE BEEN THE ORIGINAL VERSIONS NEVER INCLUDED AT THE PSYCHIATRIC HEALTH FACILITIES SO I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOLLOW UP ON MY- CALLING FROM STOCKTON'S COMMENTS WHICH- I THINK WE HAVE THE SAME CONCERN MAYBE NOT AT THE SAME LEVEL BUT THE SAME CONCERN. I AS OPPOSITION STATED AND THEN YOUR RESPONSE WAS IS THAT- IT WOULD SEEM TO BE PURELY BUDGETARY. I DO HAVE TO RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE I WE HAVE LIMITED BEDS IN KERN COUNTY TULARE COUNTY IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY. AND IF THIS BILL PASSES WHICH I THINK IS A REALLY GOOD BILL I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE I THINK IT'S A GOOD BILL I DON'T THINK PEOPLE SHOULD BE. REQUIRED TO PROVE THAT PAYMENT SOURCES BEFORE THEY'RE ACTUALLY TREATED. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. AND I HAVE DOCTORS THAT TALKED TO ME- ALL THE TIME AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER FALLING ALL THE TIME ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO DO FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLDS NOT BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE MEDICATION. BECAUSE THEY'LL HAVE TO GO TO KING COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH- THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE IS THAT- IS THERE A CONCERN THAT IF THIS BILL. PASSES AND IT WRAPS AROUND. THE PSYCHIATRIC HEALTH FACILITIES INCLUDED IN THE COUNTIES WHERE THE COUNTY SERVICES CONCERN IN ONE PART OF IT IS BUDGETARY. BUT I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT PART IS THAT PRIVATE HEALTH INSURERS AND- INDIVIDUALS OF PRIVATE PAY. MAY BE ABLE TO PUSH OUT OR USE BEDS- THAT ARE OF LIMITED SPACE. AS WE KNOW NOW- THAT FOR MEDICAL. YOU KNOW MEDICATIONS. SO I'M CURIOUS IF YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON THAT. ONE OF THE CLARIFY IF I COULD- THERE ARE NO TRANSFERS IF THERE IS NO BAD. YOU KNOW WHAT PART OF ME THERE IS NO TRANSFERRED IF THERE IS NO BED SPACE AVAILABLE. THAT'S THE ONLY REASON THERE'S A TRANSFER IS THERE'S AN OPEN BED AVAILABLE. AT THAT POINT WE SIMPLY. WANT THEM TO SELECTED WITHOUT LOOKING AT THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. I APPRECIATE THAT I GUESS MY UNDERSTANDING IS IT LIKE WE HAVE ONE SIXTEEN BED FACILITY AND LET'S JUST SAY THAT. EIGHT BEDS ARE FILLED WITH PRIVATE PAY AND EIGHT BEDS ARE FILLED WITH- WITH- INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE THEIR OWN HEALTH PLAN. IN THE COUNTY CALLS AND SAYS WE HAVE A PERSON ON ME TO MEDICAL OR WHATEVER THEY SAY TO TRANSFER A BED. I THINK THAT- REQUIRING THIS COULD. YOUR DOCTOR OR AN EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTOR AND DOCTOR PAN IS ALSO A PHYSICIAN- SO I'M JUST TRYING TO CONVEY- THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE THAT MY COUNTY HAS SHARED WITH ME AND YOU SEE NO. ISSUES WITH THAT WHATSOEVER OF SPACE BEING FILLED UP WITH OTHER THAN MEDICAL PATIENTS FOR. COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH CENTER AND WE USE YOUR EXAMPLE IF WE COULD YOU HIGHLIGHTED SIXTEEN. PEOPLE TO FEEL SIXTEEN BEDS THERE WOULD BE NO OPEN SPACE FOR A TRANSFER TO GO TO THAT FACILITY. NOW IF THERE HAPPENS TO BE AN OPEN SPACE I THINK. THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE YOU TODAY WOULD SIMPLY ASK THAT THAT SPACE NOT BE JUDGED BASED ON THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. BUT SIMPLY SEE IT AS A HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE DUE TO THE EMERGENCY PSYCHIATRIC CONDITION THAT THEY'RE IN. I AGAIN AND MAYBE I'M JUST MISLEAD MISSING AND I DON'T MEAN TO KEEP CIRCLING BACK I AGREE. I AGREE THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE JUDGED% ON THEIR ABILITY TO PAY THE BILL BEFORE ME I UNDERSTAND AND I AGREE WITH THAT AS A MTTER OF FACT I'VE- VOTED FOR IN THE PAST. BUT THIS NEW CONCERN WITH THE HEIGHTS- PSYCHIATRIC HEALTH FACILITIES. THE PROBLEM IS THAT. IF SECRETARY HEALTH FACILITIES WERE NOT IN THERE THEN- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT MEDICAL PATIENTS WOULD BE PLACED THERE. AND NOT SO MUCH A PRIVATE PAYER PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE THEY WOULD GO TO. AN OTHER FACILITIES OTHER THAN COUNTY PROVIDED FACILITIES IS THAT NOT TRUE. I'M NOT SURE I'M TRACKING EVERY PART OF YOUR EXAMPLE THERE RIGHT. I WOULD- MORE LIKELY POINTS TO WHAT DOCTOR EGGMAN HAD BROUGHT UP WHICH IS THE LACK OF NECESSARY BEDS FOR. US AS A STATE TO ADDRESS THIS. THUS THE LEADERSHIP THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE STATE IS PROVIDING TO INVEST INTO THESE CONTINUANCE OF CARE MAY SUPPLEMENT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FROM THE POLICY DECISION WHICH IS BEFORE US TODAY WHICH IS SEPARATE AND ALL THE BUDGETARY- QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS THAT WE'RE HEARING AS WELL. OKAY I GUESS LIKE I SAID THAT IF THE FACILITY IS FULL WITH PRIVATE PAID AND THERE WOULD BE NO ROOM FOR MEDICARE PATIENTS AND THEN WHAT WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM- ARE THEY JUST ALLOWED HER TO REMAIN IN THE HOSPITAL SO THERE'S NO TRANSFER THEY STAY HOSPITALIZED. WHEN I WAS IN THE E. R. IF I WAS NOT ABLE TO FIND A HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE THEY WOULD STAY IN THE E. R. INTO WE FOUND. THEM THE CARE THEY WOULD NEED AND REQUIRE. AND OFTEN TIMES THE EMERGENCY ROOM IS NOT THE BEST PLACE FOR THOSE WHO ARE SUFFERING WITH AN EMERGENCY PSYCHIATRIC CONDITION TO LANGUISH IN SET FOR DAYS ON END. AND BELIEVE THAT IF WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEND THEM TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE BECAUSE OF THAT IS AVAILABLE. THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT WE PASSED POLICY. IN THAT VEIN AS WELL OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT AND LIKE I SAID I DO AGREE WITH- MIKE CALLING FROM STOCKTON THAT BROUGHT THIS UP WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH BEDS. AND I GUESS MY CONCERN THE HUGE CONCERN THAT I HAVE IS I ALIGN MYSELF WITH THE COUNTIES THAT FEEL LIKE IF THERE'S- SIXTEEN BEDS AND THEY'RE ALL TAKEN BYPRIVATE PAY THEN THERE WOULDN'T BE. ANY ROOM FOR THOSE THAT- DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY AND THAT'S A CONCERN THAT I HAVE AS WELL- I DO HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION AND- PSYCHIATRIC HEALTH FACILITIES- INCLUSION IN THIS BILL. ACTUALLY CREATED. OPPOSITION FROM CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. YOUR UNDERSTANDING AS WELL OR NOT. CURRENTLY C. H. A. AS IN ENOUGH. TO THE BILL. AND THEY HAVEN'T HAD ANY DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU ABOUT BEING IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL NOT IN THIS VERSION OF THE BILL THAT WE'RE WORKING ON THAT OKAY. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ANSWERING MY QUESTIONS. RIGHT THANK YOU SERA. THANK YOU MR CHAIR YOU KNOW I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEMS WITH. THE LACK OF MENTAL EALTH BEDS. IN THE STATE IN FACT IT'S A TRAGEDY THAT WE HAVEN'T. ADDRESSED THAT ISSUE. AND I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM WITH THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES I HAVE A QUESTION ACTUALLY OF- THE OPPOSITION IF THEY'RE STILL ON THE LINE. MISTER CHAIR. YES IT CAN WE PLEASE BRING ON TYLER- RIND A RANDY- BACK ON THE LINE. THE SURGERY. YES THANK YOU IF YOU'RE THERE I'D I'D JUST LIKE TO REALLY TRY TO CLARIFY THE OPPOSITION IS IT YOUR POSITION THAT YOU WANT TO HOLD A VACANT BED IN A PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY. FOR A MEDIC HELP PATIENT SO IF THERE IS A REFERRAL FROM AN EMERGENCY ROOM. EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT PHYSICIAN AND THE PATIENT IS NOT MEDICARE ALL YOU WOULD PREFER TO NOT TAKE THAT PATIENT IS THAT IT. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION BETTER ROCK- I WOULD LIKE THAT YOU KNOW RESPONDED SAYING THAT THERE IS YOU KNOW COUNTRY FALL YOU MIGHT NEED FOR AND THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF BAD. I THINK I MIGHT ADD HI YOU KNOW. UNDERGROUND THAT WE WOULD AT SAY THAT OUR FACILITIES ARE SPECIALIZED FOR THE MEDICARE POPULATION IN THAT YOU SEE IN OUR RESORT. FOR THE POPULATION THAT COUNTY RESPONSIBLE FOR AND THAT WE HAD YOU KNOW BUILT OUT THERE AFTER THE ORDER Q. FAIL OR FEDERAL BIRTH BY HAVING A PRIVATELY INSURED INDIVIDUALS IN OUR FACILITY. EVEN WITHOUT ON IT THAT YOU KNOW OPPORTUNITY TO GUIDE HOW THE CLOCK REMEMBER BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE CAN ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS. AND APOLOGIZE I'M HEARING A LITTLE FEEDBACK. WELL IF THAT I THOUGHT THAT WE YOUR POSITION. YOU HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT IDEA BEFORE I CAME TO THIS BODY I SERVED ON A FEW HOSPITAL BOARDS OVER THE YEARS SINCE I'M PRETTY OLD. AND I RECALL BEING ON A HOSPITAL BOARD AT ONE POINT IN TIME WHERE WE TOOK A PATIENT INTO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WHO IS AN ADULT PATIENT. FRANKLY THE SON OF A FRIEND OF MINE. WHO ATTEMPTED TO COMMIT SUICIDE BY DRINKING ANTIFREEZE. PATIENT IS STABILIZED OBVIOUSLY HAD A MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM- FOR AS I RECALL TWO WEEKS IN THE HOSPITAL COULD NOT FIND A MENTAL HEALTH BED IN WHICH TO DIRECT THE PATIENT. THE ACUTE CARE FACILITY WAS NOT LICENSED TO PROVIDE PSYCHIATRIC CARE YET ATTEMPTED TO CARE FOR THE PATIENT- IN A ROOM WITH A TWENTY FOUR HOUR WATCH THAT AS I RECALL AT LEAST AT THE TIME WAS REQUIRED UNFORTUNATELY. STUFFHAPPENS IN THE PATIENT- SLIPPED OUT OF THE ROOM WENT TO THE FIRE EXIT ON THE SEVENTH OR EIGHTH FLOOR THE FACILITY. MANAGED TO DO WHAT THE ANTI FREEZE COULD NOT DO. AND FINISHED THE JOB AND COMMITTED SUICIDE FOR LACK OF A MENTAL HEALTH BED SO IF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS WE ARE TO HOLD VACANT BEDS. BECAUSE OF THE PAY OR WHO IS GOING TO BE PROVIDING THE PAYMENT FOR THE SERVICE. DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE FAIL TO DO OUR JOB IN THE STATE BY PROVIDING A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF MENTAL HEALTH BEDS AND PERHAPS WE FAILED TO DO OUR JOB LIKE. STRAIGHTENING OUT OUR REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM WE CANNOT AFFORD TO KEEP BEDS VACANT WAITING FOR THE KIND OF PATIENTS THAT YOU WANT TO SERVICE WE NEED TO HAVE THOSE BEDS AVAILABLE AND IF THERE'S A PATIENT THAT NEEDS A BED THE PATIENT NEEDS TO BE DIRECTED THERE. SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANKS THANK YOU ARE THERE OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY SEEING NONE- COUPLE ACTUALLY DOES NOT MAKE A COUPLE POINTS AS WELL AND AGAIN- REALLY PUT US A MEMBER OF RANDALL  DOCTRINE BUT REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I KNOW THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME. I DO WANT TO CLARIFY THAT- I THINK THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SOME QUESTIONS EARLIER AND THE DIALOGUE THAT. PREVIOUS VERSIONS AS WELL THIS VERSION INCLUDES THE COUNTY PSYCHIATRIC- HEALTH FACILITIES ARE SO SOMETIMES KNOWN AS PUFFS- IN FACT THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION- BECAUSE IT INCLUDES THOSE IS- IT IS NOT OPPOSED TO THIS BILL PREVIOUS CASES THEY HAVE ACTUALLY OPPOSE BILLS WHICH DID INCLUDE THOSE PSYCHIATRIC HEALTH FACILITIES THE ONES THAT. I THINK THE ROUTE DIRECTORS ASKING TO ACTUALLY REMOVE SITES ONE MAKE THAT CLEAR. YES I THINK THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT THE HOSPITALIZATION AND THEIR POSITIONS SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION'S POSITIONS THEY NEED TO BE INCLUDED- WHICH IS THE LOCUS OF THE OPPOSITION- I WOULD ALSO SAY IS THAT. IT IS AND THAT HE WAS POINTED OUT BY- BY- CENTER ADMIN AND ALSO SENT A ROSTER THAT. YOU KNOW WE AND ALSO CENTER AROUND LOW I MEAN UP THE FINAL PROBLEMS WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH BEDS. THE QUESTION THEN IS THAT WHEN THERE IS A BED OPEN DO YOU JUST HOLD IT OPEN BECAUSE- THE PERSON DOESN'T HAVE THE RIGHT INSURANCE AND I GET IT. THE COUNTY'S. CREATED THE SIXTEEN BED FACILITY IS TO BE SURE WE COULD BILL MEDICARE RIGHT BECAUSE THE MEDICAL RULES YOU CAN'T SOMETHING LARGE AND SIXTEEN BEDS. AND SO- YOU KNOW AND I UNDERSTAND THEIR CONCERN THAT WELL IS THIS PATIENT ME NOT NECESSARY HAVE MEDIC COW. WHO COULD GO TO ANOTHER FACILITY BUT THOSE FACILITIES ARE FULL NOW AND UP IN OUR FACILITY. NOW THERE'S NO BAD LEFT AT ALL. BUT YET THEY'RE NOT USING IT. AND YES WE DON'T KNOW WHEN SOMEONE MIGHT NEED. THAT BAD IN THE FUTURE BUT- THEN THE ISSUE DOWN TO I THINK CENTER. THE SCHOOL THIS IS THAT ARE WE JUST HOLD. END OF SHORTAGE OF HOLDING. FOR SOME TIME ON CERTAIN. WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO ACTUALLY MEETS THE BILLING QUALIFICATIONS INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY PROVIDING CARE TO SOMEONE WHO TRULY NEED STATS. AND CERTAINLY I THINK WELL IT AND I THINK- DO YOU- THAT. YOU KNOW WE PROBABLY NEED TO CONVERT ALL WE NEED MORE BEDS- I THINK CENTER ADMISSION AT THE CASE OF LEGISLATION FOR REGISTRY SO WE HAVE A BETTER SENSE- AND DEAL AND DESPITE TRANSFERS UP TO HAVE TO TAKE PLACE BUT FUNDAMENTALLY I THINK THE POLICY ISSUE IS THAT- SHOULD SOMEONE BE ABLE TO GET A BED IF THERE'S A BAD THAT'S- OPEN OR DO WE SIMPLY SAY NO WE CAN DO A- CENTRALLY I. INSURANCE CHECK AND IF YOU'RE AN IRONICALLY IF YOU'RE NOT IN THAT ACCOUNT USES THE OTHER WAY AROUND. YOU'RE NOT MEDICARE YOU CAN GET THE BAD AND- THEREFORE YOU HAVE TO WAIT- SO- SO CERTAINLY I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL- AND THIS POLICY AND- SUMMER AND LIVED LIKE CLOTHES. THANK YOU MR CHAIR FOR THE ROBUST DISCUSSION AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AND- IF I WILL I'LL TAKE SENATOR ROTH. STATEMENT AS MICHAEL'S.

OKAY- THIS BILL BUILDS ON WORK DONE LAST YEAR THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SOME CONFUSION AROUND ISSUES AROUND PARITY WITH MENTAL HEALTH. AND IN THIS. IT WAS THE PEOPLE THAT THINK THAT YOU CAN USE A MIDDLE HEALTH SERVICES ACTED TO TREAT PEOPLE WITH THE COAL OCCURRING. DISORDER THAT THAT WAS SOLVED LAST YEAR BY A BILL SAYING THAT YOU COULD TREAT SOMEBODY WITH A- MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE AND AS WELL AS A SUBSTANCE USE ISSUE. WE KNOW THOSE THINGS OFTEN GO HAND IN HAND THIS BILL TAKES IT A STEP FURTHER. AND SAYS TO FURTHER CLARIFY THAT IN SOME OF THE EARLY PREVENTION OF MONEY USED FOR THAT IN THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. THAT MONEY CAN ALSO BE USED FOR PEOPLE WITH THE SUBSIDIES ISSUE OR COLD CURRENT DISORDERS- SO THAT IS THE BILL AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. BUT WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT AND WE HAVE- WAS A GLORY FROM THE DIRECTOR OF- THE- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. I HAVE MY NOTES RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME SO I AM. A CARROT SOMEBODY ELSE'S BILL. AS WELL AS- DR.

THE SPEEDS IN PRAGUE DURING THIS BILL. A. B. SIX THIRTY EIGHT AUTHORIZES THE USE OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDING. FOR PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION STRATEGIES. TO ADDRESS SUBSTANCE ABUSE. AS WELL AS MENTAL HEALTH CODE DURING THE SHORT. BUT THE PSYCHIATRIST. I WANT TO PRESERVE ALL THE FUNDING AVAILABLE TO MEDICAL CONDITION. FULL STOP BUT I THINK THIS LAW IS NECESSARY FOR THREE REASONS. FIRST SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERIS A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION. IN MY CLINICAL PRACTICE I REGULARLY SEE THAT THESE TECHNICIANS ARE CONNECTED THEY'RE LINKED. THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE FAMILY OR FRIENDS WITH ADDICTION I'M SURE YOU SEE THE SAME. THE DISTINCTION IN OUR POLICIES. IS A RELIC OF AN OUTDATED UNDERSTANDING. THE SCIENCE IS VERY CLEAR ON THE SENATE WHY ACROSS THE BOARD IN PSYCHIATRY THERE'S AN INTEGRATE MODEL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE SERVICES. SECOND USE IT AS A MAJOR COMPLICATING FACTORS OTHER MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. IT'S ASSOCIATED WITH FORCED RESPONSE WRITTEN. MORE HOSPITALIZATIONS AND MUCH FOR COVERAGE. PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS DIED AFTER TWENTY FIVE YEARS EARLIER THAN NORMAL AND GOOD CONTRIBUTOR TO THIS IS TO USE ALCOHOL USE ILLICIT DRUG USE IN OVERTIME. HAVING SEPARATE FROM SUBSTANCE USE AND MENTAL HEALTH JUST BEING PUT THROUGH THE CRACKS. AND THIRD. EARLY IN LIFE. FIVE TIME REST OF MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. FOR INSTANCE AMONG KIDS WITH A VULNERABILITY TO DEVELOP SCHIZOPHRENIA TO MAKE REALLY USED TO CANNABIS INCREASE. WHEN IT COMES TO PREVENTION AND- REALLY FOR CHILDREN.

IT'S STILL A CRIME AND IS ALIGNED WITH THE STATED PURPOSE OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE ACT. TO DEFINE SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AMONG CHILDREN ADULTS AND SENIORS AT THE CONDITION DESERVING PRIORITY ATTENTION INCLUDING PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES HAD STATED BY DOCTOR DAMAGE. BUT SINCE HE'S THE STARTER IS A MENTAL ILLNESS THAT'S RECOGNIZED BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH.

DANDER CLASSIFICATION OF MENTAL DISORDERS USED IN CLINICAL RESEARCH POLICY AND REIMBURSEMENT. AND WHICH IS RECOGNIZED AS TWO D.

NOW RECOGNIZED AS A MENTAL HEALTH DISORDER AND THE REALITY IS THAT I AGREE WITH SOME OF THE COMMENTS YOU CAN'T NECESSARILY TREAT ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER. BOTH ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND ESPECIALLY THAT. NOW THAT WE KNOW ALL THIS LAST YEAR HAS CHALLENGED SO MANY INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ALREADY DEALING WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS AND NOW ARE. YOU KNOW I'M- TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT HAS TIME OFF TO REALLY INCREASE THE SUBSTANCE USE SO NOW I FEEL THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO DO. I KNOW THAT THERE'S CONCERNS ABOUT THE FUNDING BEING DIMINISHED HOWEVER THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE ACTUALLY NEED TO DO. EARLY PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION IS KEY TO ANY DISEASE DISORDER OR OR ELEMENT SO I FULL HEARTEDLY SUPPORT THIS AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR AND I WOULD MAKE HE BILL WHEN APPROPRIATE THANK YOU.

THANK YOU MR CHAIR AND GOOD AFTERNOON. COLLEAGUES I'D LIKE TO FIRST START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE COLLABORATION ON THIS MEASURE- WE DO ACCEPT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO ADD A SUNSET AFTER TEN YEARS OF IMPLEMENTATION. AND THE AMENDMENTS TO ALLOW FOR ANOTHER ENTITY TO PROVIDE COMPATIBLE CERTIFICATION. AS APPROVED BY CDPH. CALIFORNIA REQUIRES EVERY SKILLED NURSING FACILITY OR SNAPS TO EMPLOY A MEDICAL DIRECTOR WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF. RESIDENT CARE POLICIES AND THE COORDINATION OF MEDICAL CARE IN THIS NOV. EIGHTY SEVEN FORTY NINE WOULD PROHIBIT A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY FROM CONTRACTING WITH A PERSON AS A MEDICAL DIRECTOR IF THE PERSON IS NOT. OR WILL NOT BE WITHIN FIVE YEARS CERTIFIED THROUGH THE AMERICAN POST ACUTE. AND LONG TERM CARE MEDICINE AS A CERTIFIED MEDICAL DIRECTOR OR WITH TODAY'S AMENDMENTS CERTIFIED BY A COMPATIBLE CERTIFICATION PROGRAM APPROVED BY CDPH. HAS A POINTED OUT BY THE SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE CHAIR THIS IS OUTSIDE OF THE STANDARD OF CARE WE COULDN'T AGREE MORE. THE STANDARD OF CARE IS INSUFFICIENT AND THE STANDARD OF CARE DID NOT SERVE THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF CALIFORNIA'S ELDERS. DURING THE PANDEMIC WE HAVE CONTINUED TO WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO UNDERSTAND OUR SHARED INTENT. OF IMPROVING HEALTH OUTCOMES AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS MOVING FORWARD. THIS BILL INCREASES ACCOUNTABILITY COST THE STATE NOTHING AND PROFESSIONAL EYES IS A POSITION OF GREAT IMPORTANCE. AGING CALIFORNIANS AND OUR MOST FRAIL LIVING IN SNAPS HAVE BEEN A TRAGIC HIGHLIGHT OF THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THIEVES HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR A MINOR PERCENTAGE OF CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT VIRUS CASES BUT A FAR GREATER PERCENTAGE OF ITS DEATHS. WHILE COLONEL VIRUS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE THAT'S THE UNDERLYING CAUSES THAT ALLOWED FOR THE INORDINATE NUMBER OF DEATHS AMONGST RESIDENTS. AND STAFF HAVE BEEN IN EVIDENT AND- FOR DECADES RESEARCH IN THE AREAS OF STAFFING PROTOCOLS INFECTION PREVENTION AND OUT OF THE FUNDING MECHANISMS. HAVE LED TO AN INDUSTRY THAT NEEDS GREATER STRUCTURES IN PLACE TO DELIVER A CARE MODEL THAT IS SUSTAINABLE SAFE AND ABLE TO MEET DEMAND AS NEEDED. MEDICAL DIRECTORS AND SNIFFS CAN BETTER SERVE AGING CALIFORNIANS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES LIVING IN CONGREGATE CARE SETTINGS BY HAVING THE ADDITIONAL TRAINING THAT COMES WITH CERTIFICATION.
