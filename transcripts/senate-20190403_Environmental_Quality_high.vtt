AS A MORAL MANDATE.

00:17:29.948 --> 00:17:33.051
AT THE TIME IT TOOK A TWENTY SIX

TWENTY SEVEN YEARS AGO.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.935
SO IS A LAND MANAGEMENT AGENCY

00:17:50.002 --> 00:17:50.502
THE PARK DISTRICT IS KEENLY

00:17:50.569 --> 00:17:52.571

00:18:07.152 --> 00:18:08.353
MANAGEMENT.

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:10.589
AND THAT IS FAR FAR LESS THAN

00:18:10.656 --> 00:18:11.657
THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IT

00:18:11.723 --> 00:18:13.225
COST RECOVER FROM THE OAKLAND

00:18:13.292 --> 00:18:15.260
HILLS FIRE.

00:18:15.327 --> 00:18:16.862
IN A TWO THOUSAND FOUR WE WENT

00:18:16.929 --> 00:18:18.897

MANAGEMENT PLAN -- THAT IN IT'S

00:18:24.736 --> 00:18:26.305
BEEN GIVEN ENVIRONMENTAL

00:18:26.371 --> 00:18:27.873
CLEARANCE WE STARTED THAT.

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.108
TWENTY TEN IT TOOK EIGHT YEARS

00:18:30.175 --> 00:18:30.609
TO GET THE ENVIRONMENT A

00:18:30.676 --> 00:18:32.010
CLEARANCE TO DO THAT WORK.

00:18:32.077 --> 00:18:33.245
THE CLOCK IS TICKING.

00:18:33.312 --> 00:18:36.014
AND DEMAND WILL INCREASE M. AND

00:18:36.081 --> 00:18:37.382
ACCELERATE AS THE CLIMB IT

00:18:37.449 --> 00:18:38.951
CONTINUE TO CHANGE IN THE NEED

00:18:39.017 --> 00:18:40.752
IS REALLY URGENT.

00:18:40.819 --> 00:18:42.287
A BOND INFUSION OF THIS KIND

00:18:42.354 --> 00:18:43.889
WOULD ACCELERATE THE WORK AND

00:18:43.956 --> 00:18:45.657
LEVERAGE DIGITAL RESOURCES FROM

00:18:45.724 --> 00:18:47.192
FEMA HELLFIRE.

00:18:47.259 --> 00:18:49.528
I KNOW YES WE'RE REALLY AT THIS

00:18:49.595 --> 00:18:50.629
POINT IN A RACE.

00:18:50.696 --> 00:18:53.165
AGAINST A CATASTROPHIC FIRES AS

00:18:53.232 --> 00:18:53.732
THEY RELEASE MORE AND MORE

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:54.633
CARBON.

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.535
INTO THE AIR EXACERBATING THE

00:18:56.602 --> 00:18:58.170
PACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:18:58.237 --> 00:18:59.738
AND INCREASING HEALTH IMPACTS --

00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:01.607
TO OUR COMMUNITIES AS AN ANNUAL

00:19:01.673 --> 00:19:03.909
BAD AIR QUALITY DAYS INCREASE

00:19:03.976 --> 00:19:05.010
THE ANNUAL BAD AIR.

00:19:05.077 --> 00:19:06.445
AIR QUALITY DAYS INCREASE AND AS

00:19:06.512 --> 00:19:09.715
AN EXAMPLE OF THAT DURING THE

00:19:09.781 --> 00:19:11.583
CAMPFIRE LAST YEAR.

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:12.184
AS THE TWO COUNTIES WHICH WE

00:19:12.251 --> 00:19:13.085
SERVE ALONG WITH ALL THE THE

00:19:13.151 --> 00:19:15.287
REST COUNTIES -- IN THE EAST BAY

00:19:15.354 --> 00:19:17.489
EXPERIENCE THE WORST AIR ON THE

00:19:17.556 --> 00:19:20.659
PLANET FOR THIRTEEN DAYS -- EVEN

00:19:20.726 --> 00:19:21.860
WORSE THAN BEIJING.

00:19:21.927 --> 00:19:23.595
AND THAT'S EXAMPLE OF THAT

00:19:23.662 --> 00:19:24.830
CATASTROPHIC.

00:19:24.897 --> 00:19:26.698
AND RELEASE OF CARBON INTO THE

PLEASED TO PRESENT SB.

00:38:51.128 --> 00:38:51.696
THREE SEVENTEEN WHICH WOULD BAN

CHEMICALS USED IN RV WASTE WATER

00:38:55.066 --> 00:38:56.801
TANKS WHICH CAN CAUSE

00:38:56.867 --> 00:38:58.135
GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION.

00:38:58.202 --> 00:38:59.437
MANY RECREATIONAL VEHICLE OWNERS

00:38:59.503 --> 00:39:01.172
USE CHEMICAL DEODORANTS TO

00:39:01.238 --> 00:39:02.973
REDUCE THE ORDERS FROM THE BLACK

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.975
WATER IN GRAY ROCK WATER TANKS

00:39:05.042 --> 00:39:05.843
IN THERE.

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:06.410
ARE VIS.

00:39:06.477 --> 00:39:07.912
THESE DEODORANTS CONTAIN TOXIC

00:39:07.978 --> 00:39:09.513
CHEMICALS LIKE FORMALDEHYDE

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:11.015
WHICH REDUCE ORDERS BY KILLING

00:39:11.082 --> 00:39:12.750
THE BACTERIA THAT LIVE IN THE

00:39:12.817 --> 00:39:14.151
TANKS AND PRODUCE THE ORDERS IN

00:39:14.218 --> 00:39:15.186
THE FIRST PLACE.

00:39:15.252 --> 00:39:16.253
WHEN ARE THE OWNERS TOOK UP

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:18.789
THEIR TANKS IN RV PARKS IN ORDER

00:39:18.856 --> 00:39:19.957
TO DISCHARGE?

00:39:20.024 --> 00:39:21.525
INTO A SEPTIC TANK THE DEPOSIT

00:39:21.592 --> 00:39:23.260
THE CONTENTS OF THEIR TANKS

00:39:23.327 --> 00:39:25.296
INCLUDING THESE TALK TOXIC

00:39:25.362 --> 00:39:26.063
CHEMICALS.

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:28.099
ONCE IN THE PARK'S SEPTIC TANK

00:39:28.165 --> 00:39:29.834
THESE CHEMICALS KILL THE

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:31.602
BACTERIA NEEDED TO TREAT THE

00:39:31.669 --> 00:39:33.370
PARKS WASTE MOST OF THESE RV

00:39:33.437 --> 00:39:35.773
PARKS REQUEST HAVE A SYSTEM.

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.508
THAT USES -- THE DECOMPOSITION

00:39:37.575 --> 00:39:39.810
OF THE WASTE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE.

00:39:39.877 --> 00:39:41.445
TO MAINTAIN THE SYSTEM.

00:39:41.512 --> 00:39:43.180
THIS CAN CAUSE A SEPTIC TANKS TO

00:39:43.247 --> 00:39:44.315
FAIL WHICH THEN REQUIRES THE RV

00:39:44.381 --> 00:39:46.617
OWNERS TO SPEND THOUSANDS OF

00:39:46.684 --> 00:39:47.351
DOLLARS IN MAINTENANCE AND

00:39:47.418 --> 00:39:48.018
REPAIRS.

00:39:48.085 --> 00:39:50.121
MORE IMPORTANTLY THE FAIL SYSTEM

00:39:50.187 --> 00:39:51.522
INCREASES THE RISK THAT

00:39:51.589 --> 00:39:53.457
UNTREATED WASTE INCLUDING THE

00:39:53.524 --> 00:39:54.792
TOXIC CHEMICALS.

00:39:54.859 --> 00:39:56.393
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FAILURE WILL

00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:57.595
MAKE ITS WAKE WAY INTO THE

00:39:57.661 --> 00:39:59.463
GROUNDWATER WHICH THREATENS THE

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:00.264
HEALTH AND SAFETY OF PARK

00:40:00.331 --> 00:40:01.899
VISITORS THE OWNERS AND

00:40:01.966 --> 00:40:03.701
NEIGHBORS NEIGHBORS IN THESE

00:40:03.768 --> 00:40:04.935
MOSTLY RURAL COMMUNITIES.

00:40:05.002 --> 00:40:06.103
IN AN EFFORT TO PROTECT THE

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:07.538
GROUND WATER ENCOURAGE THE USE

00:40:07.605 --> 00:40:10.274
OF SAFE ALTERNATIVES SB THREE

00:40:10.341 --> 00:40:12.276
SEVENTEEN BANS THE SALE AND USE

00:40:12.343 --> 00:40:14.078
OF CERTAIN TOXIC CHEMICALS.

00:40:14.145 --> 00:40:16.647
AS WELL AS REQUIRES THE RV'S TO

00:40:16.714 --> 00:40:18.215
IN THE RV OWNERS TO INFORM THE

00:40:18.282 --> 00:40:20.618
CUSTOMERS OF THE BAND THE BAND.

00:40:20.684 --> 00:40:22.286
WITH THE SIGNAGE REQUIREMENTS.

00:40:22.353 --> 00:40:23.387
THIS BILL REPRESENTS A SOLUTION

00:40:23.454 --> 00:40:24.855
FORMED WITH INPUT FROM THE STATE

00:40:24.922 --> 00:40:27.057
WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD

00:40:27.124 --> 00:40:29.026
THE REGIONAL WATER BOARD AN RV.

00:40:29.093 --> 00:40:30.628
PARK PARK OWNERS TO PREVENT

00:40:30.694 --> 00:40:32.096
GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION WE HAD

00:40:32.163 --> 00:40:33.364
AN INSTANCE.

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:35.332
RECENTLY WHERE THERE WAS FROM

00:40:35.399 --> 00:40:37.601
ALDEHYDE APPEARED IN -- GROUND

00:40:37.668 --> 00:40:39.537
WATER SYSTEM AND SO THIS REALLY

00:40:39.603 --> 00:40:41.405
ELEVATED THE ISSUE.

00:40:41.472 --> 00:40:48.612
OF CONCERN IN -- IN IN WHEN I'M

00:40:48.679 --> 00:40:50.548
AND ONE OF THE RB IN MY DISTRICT.

00:40:50.614 --> 00:40:51.482
BY RESTRICTING THE WITHIN THE

00:40:51.549 --> 00:40:52.716
IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THIS IS

00:40:52.783 --> 00:40:53.851
THAT THE THE MAKERS OF THE

00:40:53.918 --> 00:40:54.752
FORMALDEHYDE IN THESE CHEMICALS

00:40:54.819 --> 00:40:57.421
ALSO HAS A NON.

00:40:57.488 --> 00:40:59.757
TOXIC ALL THAT THEY SELL -- AND

00:40:59.824 --> 00:41:01.592
SO IT IT'S VERY EASY TO SHIFT

00:41:01.659 --> 00:41:02.927
OVER TO SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY

00:41:02.993 --> 00:41:04.795
WILL NOT CONTAMINATE THE

00:41:04.862 --> 00:41:06.463
GROUNDWATER AMONG -- BECAUSE THE

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:08.065
THE SYSTEM TO FAIL.

00:41:08.132 --> 00:41:09.600
BY RESTRICTING THESE PROJECTS

00:41:09.667 --> 00:41:10.668
NOT ONLY IS GROUNDWATER

00:41:10.734 --> 00:41:13.904
PROTECTED BUT THE WORRY AND

00:41:13.971 --> 00:41:15.506
BURDEN OF SMALL OWNERS.

00:41:15.573 --> 00:41:17.041

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:21.238

00:56:42.265 --> 00:56:44.768
POSSIBLE.

WATER CENTER I'M ONE ADELINE MY

00:56:50.774 --> 00:56:52.175
COMMENTS WITH -- ABC COMMENTS WE

00:56:52.242 --> 00:56:54.944
ARE VERY GRATEFUL TO THE SENATOR

00:56:55.011 --> 00:56:56.679
I'M AND TO THE LEGISLATURE THIS

00:56:56.746 --> 00:56:58.014
YEAR FOR THE ATTENTION BEING

00:56:58.081 --> 00:56:59.115
PAID TO SAFE DRINKING WATER.

00:56:59.182 --> 00:57:00.583
I'M IT'S IT WAS ENVIRONMENTAL

00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:02.018
JUSTICE COMMUNITY THAT

00:57:02.085 --> 00:57:03.286
ORIGINALLY PUSHED FOR THE

00:57:03.353 --> 00:57:04.420
ORIGINAL CONSOLIDATION

00:57:04.487 --> 00:57:05.522
AUTHORITIES.

00:57:05.588 --> 00:57:06.923
ALONG WITH THE STATE WATER BOARD

00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:08.191
OVER THE OPPOSITION OF THE WATER

00:57:08.258 --> 00:57:09.626
AGENCY COMMUNITY SO I THINK

00:57:09.692 --> 00:57:10.360
WE'RE ALSO JUST A PREACHER OF

00:57:10.426 --> 00:57:11.494
HOW.

00:57:11.561 --> 00:57:14.297
FAR THE CONVERSATION HAS SHIFTED

00:57:14.364 --> 00:57:15.465
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

00:57:15.532 --> 00:57:17.734
BUT WE DO HAVE CONCERNS THAT

00:57:17.801 --> 00:57:20.036
THIS IS JUST A LITTLE MORE

00:57:20.103 --> 00:57:22.005
CUMBERSOME -- THEN IT COULD BE

00:57:22.071 --> 00:57:23.773
AND SHOULD BE ABOUT WHAT WE

00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:25.408
THINK WE CAN GET IT RIGHT BY THE

00:57:25.475 --> 00:57:26.676
END WE WANT TO KEEP WORKING WITH

00:57:26.743 --> 00:57:28.011
THE AUTHOR TO DO THAT AGAIN

00:57:28.077 --> 00:57:30.346
APPRECIATE.

00:57:30.413 --> 00:57:30.947
THE CENTERS ATTENTION TO THIS

00:57:31.014 --> 00:57:34.150
ISSUE THANK YOU.

00:57:34.217 --> 00:57:34.984
AND I'M ANDREA OF INTER WITH

00:57:35.051 --> 00:57:37.453
CLEAN WATER ACTION WE ARE ALSO

00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:39.222
IN IN A POSE UNLESS AMENDED

00:57:39.289 --> 00:57:41.424
UPPER -- POSITION AT THIS POINT

00:57:41.491 --> 00:57:43.960
WE DO THANK THE SENATOR -- AS

00:57:44.027 --> 00:57:45.962
HAVE OTHERS -- FOR THIS ISSUE WE

00:57:46.029 --> 00:57:47.197
THINK THE CONCEPT OF

00:57:47.263 --> 00:57:48.865
CONSOLIDATION IS IMPORTANT BUT

00:57:48.932 --> 00:57:49.799
AS WRITTEN RIGHT NOW THE BILL

00:57:49.866 --> 00:57:51.901
STILL IS A LITTLE TOO CUMBERSOME

00:57:51.968 --> 00:57:54.103
AS YOU HEARD AND TOO EXPENSIVE

00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:55.538
TO BE A PRACTICAL SOLUTION. TO

00:57:55.605 --> 00:57:57.707
DO THINK IT DOES NEED FOR WORK

00:57:57.774 --> 00:57:59.175
AS IT MOVES SO IT THANK YOU CAN

00:57:59.242 --> 00:58:00.443
I JUST ASK YOU WHAT WHEN YOU SAY

00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:03.813
CUMBERSOME WHAT WHAT CAN YOU

00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:08.117
GIVE ME SOME SPECIFIC CONCERNS.

00:58:08.184 --> 00:58:09.118
SURE ENOUGH THERE'S A THERE'S A

00:58:09.185 --> 00:58:10.286
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT O I MEAN

00:58:10.353 --> 00:58:11.154
THERE'S INITIALLY THERE'S

00:58:11.221 --> 00:58:12.388
CERTAIN FINDINGS.

00:58:12.455 --> 00:58:14.958
THAT THE STATE BOARD WILL HAVE

00:58:15.024 --> 00:58:17.193
TO TO MAKE PRIOR TO MOVING

00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:18.761
FORWARD WITH A SOLUTION.

00:58:18.828 --> 00:58:20.463
THAT -- CURRENTLY CAN AREN'T IN

00:58:20.530 --> 00:58:21.998
PLACE SO THAT WERE A BIT

00:58:22.065 --> 00:58:23.132
CONCERNED.

00:58:23.199 --> 00:58:24.534
THAT THERE'S GONNA BE SOME

00:58:24.601 --> 00:58:26.569
PROCESS AHEAD OF SORT OF MOVING

00:58:26.636 --> 00:58:28.004
FORWARD ANY SUCH.

00:58:28.071 --> 00:58:29.105
KIND OF ANY OF THAT KIND OF

00:58:29.172 --> 00:58:30.506
IDENTIFIED AREAS IDENTIFIED

00:58:30.573 --> 00:58:32.609
SOLUTIONS AND WANT TO TRY TO

00:58:32.675 --> 00:58:35.945
EXPEDITE THAT PROCESS -- THE

00:58:36.012 --> 00:58:37.513
OTHER ANOTHER ISSUE IS THAT

00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:39.716
THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

00:58:39.782 --> 00:58:41.150
AND WAS TAKEN GOING BACK AND

00:58:41.217 --> 00:58:42.318
FORTH WHERE THERE'S A PROPOSED

00:58:42.385 --> 00:58:43.753
PLANNING GOES TO LAUGH GO IT AND

00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:44.921
CAN COME.

00:58:44.988 --> 00:58:46.956
BACK TO THE ADMINISTRATOR GOES

00:58:47.023 --> 00:58:48.958
BACK TO LEFT GO THAT GOES TO THE

00:58:49.025 --> 00:58:50.093
BOARD THERE'S A AND IT THEY CAN

00:58:50.159 --> 00:58:51.694
TAKE SEVERAL YEARS THERE'S AN

00:58:51.761 --> 00:58:52.929
APPEALS PROCESS.

00:58:52.996 --> 00:58:55.098
ALL THIS CAN TAKE SEVERAL YEARS

00:58:55.164 --> 00:58:56.966
AND IN THE MEANTIME THE

00:58:57.033 --> 00:58:58.268
COMMUNITIES AT ISSUE DON'T HAVE

00:58:58.334 --> 00:59:00.236
SAFE DRINKING WATER -- AT THE AT

00:59:00.303 --> 00:59:02.205
THE END OF THE AT THE END OF THE

00:59:02.272 --> 00:59:03.706
PROCESS THAT YOU CAN GO BACK AND

00:59:03.773 --> 00:59:05.408
FORTH THROUGH THIS PROCESS.

00:59:05.475 --> 00:59:06.943
AND STILL THAT CAN ADMINISTRATOR

00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:08.311
CAN DECIDE THIS ISN'T

00:59:08.378 --> 00:59:12.382
NECESSARILY FEASIBLE OR IN IN

00:59:12.448 --> 00:59:13.549
INCOME WE'RE BACK TO SQUARE.

00:59:13.616 --> 00:59:14.617
ONE SO I THINK WE JUST WANT TO

00:59:14.684 --> 00:59:16.352
MAKE SURE THAT WERE REDUCING AS

00:59:16.419 --> 00:59:17.620
MUCH OF THAT BACK AND FORTH AS

00:59:17.687 --> 00:59:18.421
POSSIBLE.

00:59:18.488 --> 00:59:20.223
MAKING SURE THAT THE STATE BOARD

00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:21.224
HAS THE AUTHORITY TO IDENTIFY

00:59:21.291 --> 00:59:23.092
CAM AT THE OUTSET WHAT THE BEST

00:59:23.159 --> 00:59:26.129
STRATEGY IS. TO CAN KIND OF MOVE

00:59:26.195 --> 00:59:30.366
FORWARD EXPEDITIOUSLY TOWARDS

00:59:30.433 --> 00:59:32.702
THAT END.

00:59:32.769 --> 00:59:34.203
TOTALLY GET THE YOU DON'T THINK

00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:35.738
IT.

00:59:35.805 --> 00:59:36.306
THIS FAST ENOUGH BUT I BUT

00:59:36.372 --> 00:59:39.475
SURELY.

00:59:39.542 --> 00:59:40.109
INTO AN CORRECT IF I'M WRONG BUT

00:59:40.176 --> 00:59:41.477
BUT THIS IS BE BETTER THAN WHAT

00:59:41.544 --> 00:59:43.713
CURRENTLY EXISTS.

00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:44.514
THANK YOU KNOW AND I WOULD.

00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:46.115
WOULDN'T MIND CAN KICKING THINGS

00:59:46.182 --> 00:59:46.582
OVER.

00:59:46.649 --> 00:59:47.884
TO MY COLLEAGUE ARI AYE AYE THAT

00:59:47.951 --> 00:59:48.718
WE ACTUALLY.

00:59:48.785 --> 00:59:50.086
THINK THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:59:50.153 --> 00:59:50.954
TOOLS CURRENTLY THERE'S A GOOD

00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:54.390
SB A CONSOLIDATION LAST YEAR AB --

00:59:54.457 --> 00:59:55.925
TWENTY FIVE ON GOING TO EXPAND

00:59:55.992 --> 00:59:58.361
AND IMPROVED UPON THAT THERE ARE --

00:59:58.428 --> 01:00:00.830
SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF MANAGERIAL

01:00:00.897 --> 01:00:02.065
CONSOLIDATION ONE OF THE

01:00:02.131 --> 01:00:06.169
COMMUNITIES AREN'T -- CONTINUOUS

01:00:06.235 --> 01:00:08.137
AND WHAT I THINK THIS THIS BILL

01:00:08.204 --> 01:00:10.440
SEEKS TO PROVIDE IS ANOTHER TOOL

01:00:10.506 --> 01:00:12.175
ALSO COMPLEMENTING THE CURRENT

01:00:12.241 --> 01:00:13.576
ADMINISTRATOR THOR EDDIE.

01:00:13.643 --> 01:00:15.345
I THINK TO BE TO BE HONEST I

01:00:15.411 --> 01:00:16.713
THINK WE WANT TO REALLY MAKE

01:00:16.779 --> 01:00:19.749
SURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

01:00:19.816 --> 01:00:21.284
SPECIFIC GAP.

01:00:21.351 --> 01:00:23.419
THIS IS FILLING IS AND HOW IT

01:00:23.486 --> 01:00:25.555
FITS INTO THE FRAMEWORK.

01:00:25.621 --> 01:00:28.624
RATHER THAN -- RATHER THAN RE

01:00:28.691 --> 01:00:32.362
CREATING THE FRAMEWORK.

01:00:32.428 --> 01:00:33.529
DO YOU KNOW THE OPPOSITION

01:00:33.596 --> 01:00:37.300
LETTER AND CENTER SAYS.

01:00:37.367 --> 01:00:39.402
SEEMS TO THINK THAT THIS BILL.

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:40.503
ASSUMES THAT.

01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:41.704
D. WE ARE RESULT FOR IS ALWAYS

01:00:41.771 --> 01:00:43.639
THE BEST WAY TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS

01:00:43.706 --> 01:00:45.942
AND I I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S

01:00:46.009 --> 01:00:46.642
THAT'S NOT MY READING OF THE

01:00:46.709 --> 01:00:48.311
BILL BUT YOU.

01:00:48.378 --> 01:00:48.878
DO YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THAT

01:00:48.945 --> 01:00:51.014
CONCERN.

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:53.049
THAT THEY RAISE THE STATE YOUR

01:00:53.116 --> 01:00:54.450
BILL YOU'RE BASICALLY JUST.

01:00:54.517 --> 01:00:55.218
IT'S ALL THAT AT ALL COSTS.

01:00:55.284 --> 01:00:58.821
NO MATTER WHAT.

01:00:58.888 --> 01:01:01.157
WELL I I THINK WHAT'S WHAT'S --

01:01:01.224 --> 01:01:02.191
WAS FALLACIOUS ABOUT THE

01:01:02.258 --> 01:01:03.993
ARGUMENT IS THAT THIS IS THIS IS

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:05.695
AN OPTION IT'S A TOOL.

01:01:05.762 --> 01:01:06.996
THE STATE WATER BOARD CAN DECIDE

01:01:07.063 --> 01:01:08.598
IF THIS IS NOT THE BEST TOOL IN

01:01:08.664 --> 01:01:10.099
ORDER TO BE ABLE TO GET

01:01:10.166 --> 01:01:12.301
COMPLIANCE THESE WATER SYSTEMS

01:01:12.368 --> 01:01:14.103
HAVE BEEN LIKE THIS FOREVER.

01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:16.873
AND WE PASSED RULES ABOUT HOW

01:01:16.939 --> 01:01:18.674
YOU CAN CONSOLIDATE.

01:01:18.741 --> 01:01:20.209
AND IT HASN'T HELPED THEM I I

01:01:20.276 --> 01:01:21.310
WAS GOING TO BRING THE WATER

01:01:21.377 --> 01:01:22.478
BOTTLE SO YOU COULD SEE WHAT'S

01:01:22.545 --> 01:01:23.980
COMING OUT OF THE TAP BECAUSE

01:01:24.047 --> 01:01:26.082
IT'S URGENT.

01:01:26.149 --> 01:01:27.250
AND WHAT'S WHAT'S [inaudible]

01:01:27.316 --> 01:01:29.285
WHAT?

01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:30.686
KIND OF BLOWS MY MIND ABOUT ALL

01:01:30.753 --> 01:01:32.288
OF THIS IS THAT.

01:01:32.355 --> 01:01:34.824
IS THAT ANY TIME YOU HAVE TO GO

01:01:34.891 --> 01:01:36.759
THROUGH A LAUGH CO PROCESS.

01:01:36.826 --> 01:01:38.294
IT'S IT'S BURDENSOME BECAUSE

01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:41.464
WE'VE WE'VE VESTED IN LASKO THE

01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:44.300
AUTHORITY TO TO DO THINGS THAT

01:01:44.367 --> 01:01:45.001
NO OTHER.

01:01:45.068 --> 01:01:46.836
YEAH ON A REGIONAL BASIS THAT NO

01:01:46.903 --> 01:01:48.037
OTHER GOVERNMENT CAN DO SO THEY

01:01:48.104 --> 01:01:50.039
HAVE TO BE CAREFUL TO HAVE TO BE

01:01:50.106 --> 01:01:50.606
PUBLIC HEARINGS HAVE TO BE

01:01:50.673 --> 01:01:51.040
NOTICED.

01:01:51.107 --> 01:01:52.408
PEOPLE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:01:52.475 --> 01:01:53.810
MAKE COMMENTS ON WHAT THEY'RE

01:01:53.876 --> 01:01:55.411
GONNA DO THAT PROCESS IS

01:01:55.478 --> 01:01:56.712
CUMBERSOME AND I WISH WE COULD

01:01:56.779 --> 01:01:58.714
JUST DO AWAY WITH IT MAYBE IT'S

01:01:58.781 --> 01:02:04.821
A IT'S JUST A TOOL TO SEE IF WE

01:02:04.887 --> 01:02:06.089
CAN GET OURSELVES THERE IN PART

01:02:06.155 --> 01:02:07.256
OF THE PROBLEM IS IN MANY OF

01:02:07.323 --> 01:02:07.757
THESE.

01:02:07.824 --> 01:02:09.192
COMMUNITIES THEY'RE ISOLATED

01:02:09.258 --> 01:02:11.394
THEY'RE NOT NEXT TO A BIG SYSTEM

01:02:11.461 --> 01:02:13.362
AND SO THERE'S NOT A BIG SYSTEM

01:02:13.429 --> 01:02:14.931
YOU CAN POINT TO TO SAY WE NEED

01:02:14.997 --> 01:02:16.299
FOR YOU TO COME IN AND AND HELP

01:02:16.365 --> 01:02:17.366
MAKE THIS.

01:02:17.433 --> 01:02:19.669
WATER SYSTEM COMPLIANCE IF

01:02:19.735 --> 01:02:21.971
THEY'RE SO WHAT THAT THE CONCEPT

01:02:22.038 --> 01:02:23.739
IS IT IS THAT YOU GET A NUMBER

01:02:23.806 --> 01:02:26.242
OF NON COMPLIANT SYSTEMS AND TRY

01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:27.910
TO BUILD THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIX

01:02:27.977 --> 01:02:29.879
THEM UP AND UP AND MAKE IT WORK.

01:02:29.946 --> 01:02:31.781
FOR ALL OF THEM RATHER THAN JUST

01:02:31.848 --> 01:02:33.950
WAITING AROUND TO FIND A SYSTEM

01:02:34.016 --> 01:02:34.550
THAT.

01:02:34.617 --> 01:02:36.586
THAT THAT THAT WANTS TO ADOPT A

01:02:36.652 --> 01:02:37.687
MINUTE IT THIS WAY.

01:02:37.753 --> 01:02:38.888
AT THIS RATE WE WON'T WE WON'T

01:02:38.955 --> 01:02:40.490
GET CLEAN WATER FOR PEOPLE FOR

01:02:40.556 --> 01:02:42.024
MANY MANY YEARS AND SO THERE'S

01:02:42.091 --> 01:02:43.993
THERE'S NOT AND THERE'S NOT AN

01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:46.829
ATTEMPT. TO TAKE AWAY THE

01:02:46.896 --> 01:02:49.799
AUTHORITY OF LOCAL -- RESIDENTS

01:02:49.866 --> 01:02:52.468
TO PARTICIPATE AND BE ACTIVE AND

01:02:52.535 --> 01:02:54.303
TO BE AT THE TABLE THAT'S THIS

01:02:54.370 --> 01:02:56.339
WHOLE PROCESS THIS BILL AND

01:02:56.405 --> 01:02:58.040
ANTICIPATES THAT AND THERE'S A

01:02:58.107 --> 01:03:00.042
LOT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO

01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:01.577
BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE AND THEN

01:03:01.644 --> 01:03:03.045

01:07:54.003 --> 01:07:56.038
TERM COCKY.

01:07:56.105 --> 01:07:57.740
A SENDER WE'VE GIVEN THE STATE

01:07:57.807 --> 01:07:59.575
WATER RESOURCES BOARD AUTHORITY

01:07:59.642 --> 01:08:01.177
TO CONSOLIDATE THREE YEARS AGO

01:08:01.243 --> 01:08:02.878

WITH THESE FEELING WATER SYSTEMS

01:08:08.551 --> 01:08:09.385
RIGHT.

01:08:09.452 --> 01:08:11.353
NOW THERE ARE A GROUP OF WATER

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:13.489
SYSTEM SERVED IF THE STATE DOES

01:08:13.556 --> 01:08:14.690
NOT HAVE A MANDATE TO FORCE

01:08:14.757 --> 01:08:16.659
CONSOLIDATION THOSE WOULD BE THE

01:08:16.725 --> 01:08:18.427
WATER SYSTEMS WITH FOURTEEN OR

01:08:18.494 --> 01:08:21.197

PROVIDE SAFE DRINKING WATER

01:08:24.233 --> 01:08:26.569
WHICH IS NOT ON THE BALL ON THIS

01:08:26.635 --> 01:08:28.471
ON ON ON THIS BILL BECAUSE WE

01:08:28.537 --> 01:08:30.072
DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO

01:08:30.139 --> 01:08:31.507
MANDATE THEM.

01:08:31.574 --> 01:08:34.343
MY QUESTION IS YOU GOT THIS.

01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:36.579

HAVE THESE MEETINGS DO YOU

01:08:40.883 --> 01:08:43.452
ENVISION ANY OF THESE ORPHANS

01:08:43.519 --> 01:08:45.754
THESE UNDER FOURTEEN WE DON'T

01:08:45.821 --> 01:08:47.122
HAVE A MOCK MANDATE.

01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:49.758
VOLUNTARILY COMING TOGETHER TO

01:08:49.825 --> 01:08:53.729
MAKE THIS BEAST POTENTIAL NEW

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:55.197
SYSTEMS.

01:08:55.264 --> 01:08:56.699
WORKABLE DO YOU SEE DO YOU SEE

01:08:56.765 --> 01:08:57.366
IS THERE SOME SPACE IN THERE FOR

01:08:57.433 --> 01:08:58.400
THE FOLKS THAT WE CAN'T MANDATE

01:08:58.467 --> 01:09:00.169

I THINK THAT'S TOTALLY POSSIBLE.

01:09:05.875 --> 01:09:06.976
BECAUSE IF YOU WHAT BASICALLY

01:09:07.042 --> 01:09:07.977
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THESE ON A

01:09:08.043 --> 01:09:09.512
REGIONAL BASIS AND IT DOESN'T

01:09:09.578 --> 01:09:10.613
EVEN NEED TO BE ON A REGIONAL

01:09:10.679 --> 01:09:12.314
BASIS.

01:09:12.381 --> 01:09:13.482
THE ECONOMY'S.

01:09:13.549 --> 01:09:17.119

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND AND SO

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:30.366
IT'S TOTALLY POSSIBLE THAT YOU'D

01:09:30.432 --> 01:09:31.200

01:09:31.267 --> 01:09:31.901
THAT'S IN.

01:09:31.967 --> 01:09:34.069
THE NEIGHBORING THAT SAYS I WANT

01:09:34.136 --> 01:09:35.437
TO BE PART OF THIS BECAUSE WE

01:09:35.504 --> 01:09:35.938
LIKE WE CAN'T WE'RE NOT

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:37.840
PROVIDING.

01:09:37.907 --> 01:09:39.842
CLEAN DRINKING WATER EITHER AND

01:09:39.909 --> 01:09:41.110
MISTER CHAIR LAST QUESTIONS.

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:42.478
SINCE THERE HAS BEEN DISCUSSIONS

01:09:42.545 --> 01:09:44.947
GOING ON FOR THREE YEARS AND EN

01:09:45.014 --> 01:09:46.815
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU KNOW

01:09:46.882 --> 01:09:48.050
THAT THE STATE WATER RESOURCES

01:09:48.117 --> 01:09:50.219
BOARD HAS HAS.

01:09:50.286 --> 01:09:50.853
COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT'S

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:52.121
NOT [inaudible]

01:09:52.187 --> 01:09:54.123
PRACTICAL.

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:55.124
FOR FEELING SYSTEM TO BE

01:09:55.190 --> 01:09:56.926
CONSOLIDATED WITH THE CITY OF

01:09:56.992 --> 01:09:58.794
FRESNO OR CITY OR BAKERSFIELD

01:09:58.861 --> 01:09:59.828
WHEREVER.

01:09:59.895 --> 01:10:02.464
TULARE WHEREVER IT IS AND THAT

01:10:02.531 --> 01:10:05.034
IT WOULD BE MAKE MORE SENSE TO

01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:07.703
CONSOLIDATE OR MANAGE OPERATE

01:10:07.770 --> 01:10:09.505

FAMILY SYSTEM TO AUTUMN TWO TO

01:10:11.006 --> 01:10:11.206
IMPROVE.

01:10:11.273 --> 01:10:12.575
THE DELIVERY WATER IS IT

01:10:12.641 --> 01:10:14.243
POSSIBLE.

01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:15.244
WELL I'LL GO AHEAD AND ANSWER

01:10:15.311 --> 01:10:17.746
THAT -- FOR THE SENATOR I THINK

01:10:17.813 --> 01:10:19.782
THERE'S THERE'S TWO THINGS --

01:10:19.848 --> 01:10:21.383
TWO POINTS HERE WE'VE ACTUALLY

01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:22.685
BEEN WORKING IN COLLABORATION

01:10:22.751 --> 01:10:23.953
WITH THE STATE WATER BOARD TO

01:10:24.019 --> 01:10:25.688

01:10:25.754 --> 01:10:26.855
OVERALL STRUCTURE.

THEY ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE THIS

01:10:28.657 --> 01:10:29.792
IDEA THEY THINK THERE ARE

01:10:29.858 --> 01:10:31.627
SITUATIONS WHERE HAVING AN

01:10:31.694 --> 01:10:33.629

FEASIBLE SO HAVING THIS OPTION

01:10:39.368 --> 01:10:40.736
IT FEELS REALLY A POSITIVE STEP

01:10:40.803 --> 01:10:42.504

01:13:02.344 --> 01:13:04.213
COMMITTEE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:13:04.279 --> 01:13:07.082

RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD SIMPLY

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:14.556
IMPLEMENTS THOSE IN LOTS OF

01:13:14.623 --> 01:13:16.225
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND LOCAL

01:13:16.291 --> 01:13:17.926
BUSINESSES THAT PROVIDE THAT

01:13:17.993 --> 01:13:19.762
THAT ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTE TO THIS

01:13:19.828 --> 01:13:20.496
POLLUTANTS?

01:13:20.562 --> 01:13:22.231
THESE POLLUTANTS ARE REQUIRED TO

01:13:22.297 --> 01:13:23.966
GET PERMITS AND SO THE QUESTION

01:13:24.032 --> 01:13:26.502
IS HOW WAS A PRACTICAL MANNER

01:13:26.568 --> 01:13:29.271
CAN WE FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET

01:13:29.338 --> 01:13:30.606
GREATER COMPLIANCE BECAUSE THE

01:13:30.672 --> 01:13:31.673
TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS.

01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:33.142
YOU'VE GOT LIABILITY IN LOCAL

01:13:33.208 --> 01:13:34.143
JURISDICTIONS BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:13:34.209 --> 01:13:35.511
GETTING HOSED BECAUSE THIS STUFF

01:13:35.577 --> 01:13:37.346
FLOWING INTO THE SYSTEM AND YOU

01:13:37.412 --> 01:13:38.547
ALSO OF LOCAL.

01:13:38.614 --> 01:13:39.848
BUSINESSES THAT DON'T EVEN KNOW

01:13:39.915 --> 01:13:42.050
THE NEED TO COMPLY SO WHAT WE'VE

01:13:42.117 --> 01:13:44.686
DONE HERE IS TO TO REQUIRE IN

01:13:44.753 --> 01:13:46.455
THIS BILL ON WHAT WE ARE.

01:13:46.522 --> 01:13:48.290
GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES CITY OR

01:13:48.357 --> 01:13:49.958
COUNTY HAS A PERMIT TO SIMPLY

01:13:50.025 --> 01:13:52.060
HAVE A BOX THAT YOU CAN SAY AND

01:13:52.127 --> 01:13:53.128
PROVE THAT YOU HAVE THIS NOW

01:13:53.195 --> 01:13:54.363
THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THAT GOT

01:13:54.429 --> 01:13:55.931
TO COMPLIANCE OTHER LOOK ON THE

01:13:55.998 --> 01:13:57.699
WEBSITE FOR THE UNDER THE CODE

01:13:57.766 --> 01:13:59.168
TO SEE IF YOUR COMPLIANCE IS NOT

01:13:59.234 --> 01:13:59.935
A BUNCH OF EXTRA.

01:14:00.002 --> 01:14:01.703
WORK AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT FOR

01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:03.138
THOSE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BECAUSE

01:14:03.205 --> 01:14:04.273
WE ALWAYS SEE THIS AND LOCAL

01:14:04.339 --> 01:14:05.374
GOVERNMENT COMPLAINING ALL GOD

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:06.508
WERE GIVEN A MORE UNFUNDED

01:14:06.575 --> 01:14:07.509
MANDATES.

01:14:07.576 --> 01:14:11.346
THE REALITY I WOULD SUGGEST IS

01:14:11.413 --> 01:14:12.714
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. FOR

01:14:12.781 --> 01:14:13.849
NOMINAL FOR THEM BECAUSE IT'S

01:14:13.916 --> 01:14:14.449
NOT SOMETHING THAT WE'RE JUST

01:14:14.516 --> 01:14:15.083
ASKING THEM TO DO IT'S ALSO BY

01:14:15.150 --> 01:14:17.019
VIRTUE OF GETTING A COMPLIANCE

01:14:17.085 --> 01:14:18.253
YOU HAVE.

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:20.522
THIS DIMMITT THIS OF A REDUCTION

01:14:20.589 --> 01:14:22.591
OF THEIR OWN RISK IN TERMS OF

01:14:22.658 --> 01:14:24.293
THE POLLUTION LOCALLY SO.

01:14:24.359 --> 01:14:26.061
WE REQUIRE WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR

01:14:26.128 --> 01:14:28.430
IN THIS BILL IS THAT THESE ARE

01:14:28.497 --> 01:14:29.898
ENTITIES IF YOU HAVE A PERMIT

01:14:29.965 --> 01:14:31.466
OTHER SOME COUNTIES THAT DON'T

01:14:31.533 --> 01:14:32.901
REQUIRE.

01:14:32.968 --> 01:14:34.570
A BUSINESS -- YOU KNOW BUSINESS

01:14:34.636 --> 01:14:36.371
LICENSE IS FINE BUT IN THOSE

01:14:36.438 --> 01:14:39.041
COUNTIES 80% OF THOSE HAVE

01:14:39.107 --> 01:14:40.442
CITIES.

01:14:40.509 --> 01:14:41.076
I THE POLLUTION FROM THESE DEALS

01:14:41.143 --> 01:14:42.477
AND CITIES AFTER CITIES THE

01:14:42.544 --> 01:14:43.612
NUMBERS ARE PRETTY SIGNIFICANT

01:14:43.679 --> 01:14:45.614
THERE IN YOUR ANALYSIS I DID YOU

01:14:45.681 --> 01:14:46.148
GO TO HIM SPECIFICALLY.

01:14:46.215 --> 01:14:47.583
BUT THIS IS JUST A PRACTICAL WAY

01:14:47.649 --> 01:14:49.751
TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW IN THIS

01:14:49.818 --> 01:14:52.254
VERY SHARED LIABILITY AREA OF

01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:54.823
COMPLIANCE THAT WE COME UP WITH

01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:57.793

BY NIGHTERS A I SEE.

01:27:24.272 --> 01:27:26.007
UNDERSTOOD YEAH HELP THE OTHER

01:27:26.074 --> 01:27:27.475
THING I I'M JUST TO TAKE CHARGE

01:27:27.542 --> 01:27:28.943

THAT WE DID I DID A COUPLE YEARS

01:27:39.087 --> 01:27:40.888
AGO THAT -- TRIES TO PUSH THAT

01:27:40.955 --> 01:27:42.023
ENVELOPE FOR BUT SCHOOLS YOU

01:27:42.090 --> 01:27:43.358
KNOW FOR GOOD REASONS ARE GIVEN

01:27:43.424 --> 01:27:45.727
AUTONOMY AND INDEPENDENCE AND

01:27:45.793 --> 01:27:47.362
FROM A LOT OF THINGS -- BUT THEY

01:27:47.428 --> 01:27:48.963
ALSO END UP HAVING A LOT OF

AND ALL THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW

01:27:59.907 --> 01:28:01.376
THAT WE NEED TO DO. TO BE BETTER

01:28:01.442 --> 01:28:02.944

HEARING.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.468
NOT TOO LONG AGO ON CALIFORNIA'S

01:30:07.535 --> 01:30:09.504
GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM IT WAS

01:30:09.570 --> 01:30:10.805
OVER IN THE ASSEMBLY SIDE OF THE

01:30:10.872 --> 01:30:11.472
JOINT COMMITTEE HEARING THAT WE

01:30:11.539 --> 01:30:13.174
DID WITH.

01:30:13.241 --> 01:30:15.276
A SOMBER CORKS COMMITTEE.

IN A AN IMPORTANT REPORT THAT'S

01:30:19.881 --> 01:30:21.015
HAPPENED -- IN THIS GREEN

01:30:21.082 --> 01:30:23.885
CHEMISTRY SPACE SO THIS BILL.

01:30:23.951 --> 01:30:25.419
UPDATES AND STRENGTHENS

01:30:25.486 --> 01:30:26.154
CALIFORNIA'S GREEN CHEMISTRY

01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:27.789
PROGRAM IN ORDER TO PROTECT

01:30:27.855 --> 01:30:28.523
CONSUMERS FROM.

01:30:28.589 --> 01:30:30.458
HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS IN THEIR

01:30:30.525 --> 01:30:31.826
DAILY LIVES.

01:30:31.893 --> 01:30:33.895
FOLKS KNOW THAT ON TEN YEARS AGO

01:30:33.961 --> 01:30:35.296
CALIFORNIA ESTABLISHED THE GREEN

01:30:35.363 --> 01:30:36.497
CHEMISTRY PROGRAM THAT WAS

01:30:36.564 --> 01:30:38.099
DISCUSSED AND WITH CENTER CALL

01:30:38.166 --> 01:30:39.367
YOUR HOUSE BILL.

01:30:39.433 --> 01:30:40.701
I'VE BEEN SELLING MEMBER MIGHT

01:30:40.768 --> 01:30:42.637
FEAR IS AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE

01:30:42.703 --> 01:30:43.938
AND SENATOR.

01:30:44.005 --> 01:30:45.873
SIMIANS ASKED FIVE ON NINE THE

01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:47.675
PROGRAM DID CAN I RECOGNIZE

01:30:47.742 --> 01:30:49.010
THREE KEY THINGS ONE THAT

01:30:49.076 --> 01:30:50.311
CALIFORNIANS ARE SOMETIMES A

01:30:50.378 --> 01:30:52.079
KNOWINGLY EXPOSED.

01:30:52.146 --> 01:30:53.581
TO HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS IN THE

01:30:53.648 --> 01:30:55.016
PRODUCTS THAT THEY USE TO THAT

01:30:55.082 --> 01:30:56.350
THE STATE HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE

01:30:56.417 --> 01:30:57.585
IN PROTECTING THEM.

01:30:57.652 --> 01:30:59.020
AND THREE THAT USING THE BEST

01:30:59.086 --> 01:31:01.355
AVAILABLE SCIENCE IN A CLEAR

01:31:01.422 --> 01:31:02.056
TRANSPARENT REGULATORY PROCESS

01:31:02.123 --> 01:31:03.724
IS THE BEST WAITED TO DO THIS

01:31:03.791 --> 01:31:05.593
AND AND SO THE DEPARTMENT TALKS

01:31:05.660 --> 01:31:07.161
UPS CONTROL DGSE TOOK THE

01:31:07.228 --> 01:31:08.429
LEGISLATURE'S MANDATE.

01:31:08.496 --> 01:31:09.697
AND IT DEVELOPED THE FIRST OF

01:31:09.764 --> 01:31:11.632
ITS KIND SEE FOR CONSUMER

01:31:11.699 --> 01:31:12.834
PRODUCTS PROGRAM THAT WE TALK A

01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:13.968
LITTLE ABOUT EARLIER.

01:31:14.035 --> 01:31:15.670
NOW THE ON THE SERVER CONSUMER

01:31:15.736 --> 01:31:17.138
PRODUCTS PROGRAM FIRST

01:31:17.205 --> 01:31:19.574
IDENTIFIES CHEMICALS OF CONCERN

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:21.008
AND THEN IT FINDS PRODUCTS WHERE

01:31:21.075 --> 01:31:22.476
THOSE CHEMICALS.

01:31:22.543 --> 01:31:28.449
MAY BE AFFECTING USERS PEOPLE.

01:31:28.516 --> 01:31:29.684
I DGSE THEN CALLS UPON

01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:30.852
MANUFACTURERS TO PERFORM AN

01:31:30.918 --> 01:31:31.819
ALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS. TO FIND

01:31:31.886 --> 01:31:32.320
CHEMICALS THAT CAN BE

01:31:32.386 --> 01:31:34.188
SUBSTITUTED TO KEEP FOLK SAFE

01:31:34.255 --> 01:31:35.957
FOR A WHILE STILL PROVIDING. FOR

01:31:36.023 --> 01:31:36.591
THE PRODUCTS THAT THEY WANT AND

01:31:36.657 --> 01:31:38.459
NEED.

01:31:38.526 --> 01:31:39.994
NOW THE GOALS IN FRAMEWORK OF

01:31:40.061 --> 01:31:41.729
THE SEA FOR CONSUMER PRODUCTS

01:31:41.796 --> 01:31:43.331
PROGRAM ARE COMMENDABLE BUT WELL

01:31:43.397 --> 01:31:44.498
WHAT BRINGS ME HERE TODAY TO

01:31:44.565 --> 01:31:48.035
PRESENT THIS BILL SB THREE

01:31:48.102 --> 01:31:48.636
TWENTY THREE NINETY TWO TO YOU

01:31:48.703 --> 01:31:49.003
IS THE PROGRAM'S.%

01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:49.637
TIMELINE.

01:31:49.704 --> 01:31:52.940
I TODAY NO CHEMICAL NO CHEMICAL.

01:31:53.007 --> 01:31:53.941
I WAS TEN YEARS IT.

01:31:54.008 --> 01:31:55.710
HAS HAD AN ALTERNATE ANNOUNCES

01:31:55.776 --> 01:31:57.178
COMPLETED UNDER THE CERTIFICATE

01:31:57.245 --> 01:31:58.579
SUMA PRODUCTS PROGRAM.

01:31:58.646 --> 01:32:01.082
NO REGULATIONS HAVE RESULTED.

01:32:01.148 --> 01:32:04.318
HI SO GREAT FRAMEWORK.

01:32:04.385 --> 01:32:06.087
VERY LITTLE OF SUBSTANCE TO

01:32:06.153 --> 01:32:07.488
CONSUMERS AS ACTUALLY COME OUT

01:32:07.555 --> 01:32:10.758
OF THAT LAUDABLE FRAMEWORK AND

01:32:10.825 --> 01:32:12.593
AND SYSTEM.

01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:14.829
AND IN FACT ONE OF THE THINGS

01:32:14.896 --> 01:32:15.396
THAT WE HIGHLIGHTED AT OUR

01:32:15.463 --> 01:32:16.530
HEARING.

01:32:16.597 --> 01:32:17.665
WAS THIS.

01:32:17.732 --> 01:32:19.800
REPORT FROM THE PUBLIC HEALTH

01:32:19.867 --> 01:32:21.002
INSTITUTE.

01:32:21.068 --> 01:32:22.336
A LOOK BACK AT THE FIRST TEN

01:32:22.403 --> 01:32:23.471
YEARS THE PROGRAM AND WHAT'S

01:32:23.537 --> 01:32:24.805
CAUSING THE SLOWDOWN

01:32:24.872 --> 01:32:25.773
CALIFORNIA'S GREEN CHEMISTRY

01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:26.774
INITIATIVE AGE.

01:32:26.841 --> 01:32:27.575
TEN AND EVALUATION OF ITS

01:32:27.642 --> 01:32:28.809
PROGRESS AND PROMISE AT YOU

01:32:28.876 --> 01:32:29.877
MEMBERS WILL RECALL DOCTOR

01:32:29.944 --> 01:32:31.312
SOLLENTUNA SOLOMON.

01:32:31.379 --> 01:32:32.813
PRESENTING.

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:36.918
SO MY BILL TAKES. TO SOME OF THE

01:32:36.984 --> 01:32:37.618
KEY RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THIS

01:32:37.685 --> 01:32:39.987
REPORT TO STRENGTHEN THE PROGRAM

01:32:40.054 --> 01:32:41.889
AND ULTIMATELY ALLOW OUR GREEN

01:32:41.956 --> 01:32:43.257
CHEMISTRY PROGRAM TO ACHIEVE ITS

01:32:43.324 --> 01:32:44.625
GOALS.

01:32:44.692 --> 01:32:45.593
AND HERE'S WHAT IT DOES

01:32:45.660 --> 01:32:46.794
SPECIFICALLY BUILDING OFF OF

01:32:46.861 --> 01:32:47.862
THIS REPORT.

01:32:47.929 --> 01:32:50.364
I A GRANTS DGSE CLEAR AUTHORITY

01:32:50.431 --> 01:32:51.732
TO OBTAIN PRODUCT INGREDIENT

01:32:51.799 --> 01:32:54.001
DATA FROM MANUFACTURES AND IF

01:32:54.068 --> 01:32:55.336
NEEDED FROM THEIR CHEMICAL

01:32:55.403 --> 01:32:56.637
SUPPLIERS.

01:32:56.704 --> 01:32:58.339
IT ADDS NEW AUTHORITATIVE LIST

01:32:58.406 --> 01:33:00.574
OF CHEMICALS OF CONCERN TO FILL

01:33:00.641 --> 01:33:02.376
GAPS IN THE CURRENT LIST.

01:33:02.443 --> 01:33:04.712
IT REQUIRES THE TSC TO ADOPT A

01:33:04.779 --> 01:33:06.447
FIVE YEAR TIMELINE. TO IDENTIFY

01:33:06.514 --> 01:33:08.215
AND ASSESS PRIORITY PRODUCTS

01:33:08.282 --> 01:33:09.483
INCLUDING DATA COLLECTION A

01:33:09.550 --> 01:33:11.152
FUNCTION BASED APPROACH TO AVOID.

01:33:11.218 --> 01:33:12.887
REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTION SO

01:33:12.954 --> 01:33:14.088
THAT'S ALWAYS AN ISSUE WHERE YOU

01:33:14.155 --> 01:33:14.722
DON'T WANT.

01:33:14.789 --> 01:33:17.191
TO JUST REPLACE ONE GUY CHEMICAL

01:33:17.258 --> 01:33:17.792
WITH ANOTHER IT'S GOING TO BE

01:33:17.858 --> 01:33:19.493
JUST AS DAMAGING.

01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:21.829
THAT'S REFERRED IS REGRETTABLE

01:33:21.896 --> 01:33:22.430
SUBSTITUTION WONDERFUL TERM OF

01:33:22.496 --> 01:33:22.630
ART.

01:33:22.697 --> 01:33:24.365
I ND IT FINALLY IT STREAMLINES

01:33:24.432 --> 01:33:27.702
THE INFORMAL RESOLUTION AN

01:33:27.768 --> 01:33:28.869
APPEALS PROCESS HE'S AN INCREASE

01:33:28.936 --> 01:33:29.537
A FAST TRACK. FOR WHEN EXISTING

01:33:29.603 --> 01:33:30.871
STUDY SUPPORT REGULATORY

01:33:30.938 --> 01:33:32.306
RESPONSES SOMETIMES -- IT

THAT TRY TO BE A BROUGHT INTO

01:33:35.409 --> 01:33:37.511
THE CONVERSATION -- BUT UNDER

01:33:37.578 --> 01:33:38.412
THE OLD SYSTEM THERE WERE

01:33:38.479 --> 01:33:39.880
DIFFICULTIES IN DOING THAT SO I

01:33:39.947 --> 01:33:41.415
HAVE WITH ME HERE TODAY I'LL BE

AND IT TO BRING US BACK TO WHY

01:34:03.004 --> 01:34:06.307
THIS IS A PROGRAM IS IMPORTANT

01:34:06.374 --> 01:34:07.608
AND THEN WHY THE BILL IS

01:34:07.675 --> 01:34:09.110
IMPORTANT AND YOU KNOW SOMETIMES

01:34:09.176 --> 01:34:10.478
WE CAN GET WRAPPED UP SENIOR

01:34:10.544 --> 01:34:10.678
ROOM.

01:34:10.745 --> 01:34:12.780
LIKE THIS WITH JUST LEGISLATION

01:34:12.847 --> 01:34:15.182
AND REGULATION BUT THIS DOES

01:34:15.249 --> 01:34:16.717
AFFECT REAL PEOPLE.

01:34:16.784 --> 01:34:19.520
AND THE PROMISE OF THIS PROGRAM

01:34:19.587 --> 01:34:21.222
WE'VE SEEN AN INKLING OF IT BUT

01:34:21.288 --> 01:34:23.491
WE'RE NOT THERE YET -- THAT WE

01:34:23.557 --> 01:34:25.559
SHOULD RE REMEMBER I'M FOR

01:34:25.626 --> 01:34:26.827
INSTANCE SYNTHETIC FLAME

01:34:26.894 --> 01:34:28.362
RETARDANT SOMETHING THAT THIS

01:34:28.429 --> 01:34:31.232
COMMITTEE HAS LOOKED AT ITSELF --

01:34:31.298 --> 01:34:33.167
HAS BEEN ADDRESSED IN CHILDREN'S

01:34:33.234 --> 01:34:35.603
NAP MATS BY THIS PROGRA.

01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:38.439
THOSE CHEMICALS ACTUALLY ARE

01:34:38.506 --> 01:34:40.007
LINKED TO CANCER THEY BECAUSE A

01:34:40.074 --> 01:34:41.542
THYROID DESTRUCTION OF MEMORY

01:34:41.609 --> 01:34:43.778
AND LEARNING PROBLEMS CAN EVEN

01:34:43.844 --> 01:34:45.946
IN FACT IMPACT THE A PERSON'S

01:34:46.013 --> 01:34:47.148
DNA.

01:34:47.214 --> 01:34:49.917
ARM WRESTLING CHLORIDE SOMETHING

01:34:49.984 --> 01:34:51.118
THAT THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS

01:34:51.185 --> 01:34:54.155
PROGRAM IS LOOKING AT NOW IN

01:34:54.221 --> 01:34:56.724
REGULATING IN PAINT STRIPPERS

01:34:56.791 --> 01:35:00.327
HAVEN'T SALTED IN AT LEAST SIXTY

01:35:00.394 --> 01:35:01.128
FOUR DEATHS THESE ARE THE ONES

01:35:01.195 --> 01:35:03.164
WE KNOW ABOUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

01:35:03.230 --> 01:35:04.598
INCLUDING A FORTY THREE YEAR OLD

01:35:04.665 --> 01:35:06.233
INDIVIDUAL IN HUNTINGTON PARK

01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:09.103
CALIFORNIA WHO WAS ON THE JOB

01:35:09.170 --> 01:35:15.676
AND WAS FOUND DEAD IN A BATHROOM

01:35:15.743 --> 01:35:16.310
WHEN HE WAS STRIPPING AT A BATH

01:35:16.377 --> 01:35:17.311
TUB.

01:35:17.378 --> 01:35:18.279
SO YOU KNOW THIS IS ABOUT REAL

01:35:18.345 --> 01:35:19.246
PEOPLE REAL CALIFORNIANS WORKERS

01:35:19.313 --> 01:35:22.283
AND CONSUMERS -- AND IT'S REALLY

01:35:22.349 --> 01:35:24.919
ABOUT PER ANNUM BUT AS THE

01:35:24.985 --> 01:35:26.320
SENATOR HAS SAID.

01:35:26.387 --> 01:35:27.488
WOW THIS PROGRAM IS

01:35:27.555 --> 01:35:29.490
EXTRAORDINARILY INNOVATIVE IN

01:35:29.557 --> 01:35:31.492
THAT IT IS REALLY MEANT NOT TO

01:35:31.559 --> 01:35:32.560
JUST DEAL WITH CHEMICALS WITH

01:35:32.626 --> 01:35:33.961
THEIR IT'S OBVIOUS WE NEED TO

01:35:34.028 --> 01:35:35.029
GET AWAY FROM THEM BUT WHERE WE

01:35:35.096 --> 01:35:37.565
DON'T KNOW HOW TO AVOID THE

01:35:37.631 --> 01:35:39.200
REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTIONS.

01:35:39.266 --> 01:35:42.336
ARM IT IS NOT MOVING THE DOES

01:35:42.403 --> 01:35:43.537
NOT FOR FILLING IN ITS ITS

01:35:43.604 --> 01:35:44.872
PROMISE.

01:35:44.939 --> 01:35:45.973
AT THE SAME TIME WE'VE BEEN

01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:47.108
FACED WITH A SITUATION WHERE THE

01:35:47.174 --> 01:35:48.209
LEGISLATURE WITH A FEW

01:35:48.275 --> 01:35:50.544
EXCEPTIONS HAS BEEN RELUCTANT TO

01:35:50.611 --> 01:35:52.413
ADDRESS CHEMICAL SPECIFICALLY.

01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:54.648
FOR FEAR OF BEING US INTO THOSE

01:35:54.715 --> 01:35:55.916
REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTION

01:35:55.983 --> 01:35:57.284
SITUATIONS.

01:35:57.351 --> 01:35:59.120
AND SO WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO BE

01:35:59.186 --> 01:36:01.655
ABLE TO DO IS MAKE THIS PROGRAM.

01:36:01.722 --> 01:36:03.324
WORK SO WE REALLY ARE PROTECTING

01:36:03.390 --> 01:36:04.925
OUR ENVIRONMENT AND OUR

01:36:04.992 --> 01:36:06.961
CALIFORNIANS -- IV IS GOING TO

01:36:07.027 --> 01:36:08.762
GO INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL

01:36:08.829 --> 01:36:10.364
AND EXPAND ON WHAT THE SENATORS

01:36:10.431 --> 01:36:11.765
SAID ABOUT THE BILL.

01:36:11.832 --> 01:36:14.435
I JUST WANT TO END BY SAYING

01:36:14.502 --> 01:36:15.369
THAT.

01:36:15.436 --> 01:36:16.103
WELL OVER THE TEN YEARS WE

01:36:16.170 --> 01:36:17.705
HAVEN'T SEEN MUCH PROGRESS WE

01:36:17.771 --> 01:36:19.540
HAVEN'T SEEN THE REGULATORY

01:36:19.607 --> 01:36:20.875
PROCESS MOVING.

01:36:20.941 --> 01:36:22.576
QUICK ENOUGH AND REALLY AREN'T

01:36:22.643 --> 01:36:24.278
MOVING US DOWN.

01:36:24.345 --> 01:36:26.046
THE ROAD WHY AND CALIFORNIA IS

01:36:26.113 --> 01:36:27.648
FALLING BEHIND IN THAT IN

01:36:27.715 --> 01:36:28.949
PROTECTING THE PUBLIC.

01:36:29.016 --> 01:36:31.552
I'M WHAT WE ARE.

01:36:31.619 --> 01:36:33.621
ARSENE IT WELL WHAT WE HAVE SEEN

01:36:33.687 --> 01:36:36.157
IS WHERE THE PROBLEMS ARE WHEREWHERE.

01:36:36.223 --> 01:36:38.159
THE BARRIERS ARE FOR THE PROGRAM

01:36:38.225 --> 01:36:39.426
TO MOVE FORWARD AND SO REALLY

01:36:39.493 --> 01:36:40.761
WITH THIS BILL IS TRYING TO DO

01:36:40.828 --> 01:36:43.430
IS TAKE A SURGICAL APROACH. TO

01:36:43.497 --> 01:36:45.232
TO THE ISSUES ADDRESSED THE DATA

01:36:45.299 --> 01:36:48.068
GAP ADDRESS SOME OF THE OTHER --

01:36:48.135 --> 01:36:49.637
INEFFICIENCIES ADMINISTRATIVE

01:36:49.703 --> 01:36:51.038
INSUFFICIENCIES THAT ARE

01:36:51.105 --> 01:36:52.439
STOPPING THE PROGRAM FROM MOVING

01:36:52.506 --> 01:36:54.208
FORWARD IT'S NOT MEANT TO RE

01:36:54.275 --> 01:36:57.144
DEFINE IT OR TO RE DEFINE -- ITS

01:36:57.211 --> 01:36:59.780
INTENT IT'S REALLY TO MAKE THOSE

01:36:59.847 --> 01:37:01.749
FIXES SO THAT WE CAN OPTIMIZE

01:37:01.815 --> 01:37:03.150
SUCCESS IN CALIFORNIA AND

01:37:03.217 --> 01:37:05.920
PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT AND OUR

01:37:05.986 --> 01:37:06.687
PEOPLE.

01:37:06.754 --> 01:37:08.989
THANK YOU NEXT.

01:37:09.056 --> 01:37:10.224
GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS AVINASH

CAR AND I'M WITH THE NATURAL

01:37:12.793 --> 01:37:13.494
RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL.

01:37:13.561 --> 01:37:15.129
SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM

01:37:15.196 --> 01:37:16.797
IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF

01:37:16.864 --> 01:37:18.265
ADDRESSING TOXIC CHEMICALS

01:37:18.332 --> 01:37:20.034
BEFORE THEY BECOME A PROBLEM

01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:21.969
THAT IS FOCUSING ON PREVENTING

01:37:22.036 --> 01:37:22.536
TALKS EXPORTERS IN THE FIRST

01:37:22.603 --> 01:37:23.671
PLACE.

01:37:23.737 --> 01:37:24.972
RATHER THAN CLEANING UP OR

01:37:25.039 --> 01:37:28.676
FIXING THE HARMS AFTER THE FACT.

01:37:28.742 --> 01:37:30.044
MY COLLEAGUE ENTER VENTURE INTO

01:37:30.110 --> 01:37:31.412
SENATOR HAVE OUTLINED BUT THE

01:37:31.478 --> 01:37:32.913
IMPORTANT ROLE OF THE SAFER

01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:34.248
CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM IN

01:37:34.315 --> 01:37:35.816
PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE

01:37:35.883 --> 01:37:37.384
SLOW PACE OF THE PROGRAM.

01:37:37.451 --> 01:37:38.485
AND A RECENT TEN YEAR

01:37:38.552 --> 01:37:40.087
RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW BY DR

01:37:40.154 --> 01:37:40.888
SOLOMON IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH

01:37:40.955 --> 01:37:42.790
INSTITUTE ALSO OUTLINED BY THE

01:37:42.856 --> 01:37:44.325
TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL THE PROGRAM

01:37:44.391 --> 01:37:45.693
AND THE STRUCTURAL FACTORS THAT

01:37:45.759 --> 01:37:46.760
ARE HOLDING IT BACK.

01:37:46.827 --> 01:37:47.828
MAKING A SERIES OF

01:37:47.895 --> 01:37:50.064
RECOMMENDATIONS -- TO ADDRESS

01:37:50.130 --> 01:37:51.298
THOSE ISSUES.

01:37:51.365 --> 01:37:53.334
AS BETWEEN NINETY TO ADDRESS IS

01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:54.034
A NUMBER OF THOSE

01:37:54.101 --> 01:37:55.336
RECOMMENDATIONS AND WOULD REMOVE

01:37:55.402 --> 01:37:56.503
SEVERAL OF THE STRUCTURAL

01:37:56.570 --> 01:37:58.172
BARRIERS -- HOLDING THE PROGRAM

01:37:58.239 --> 01:38:01.041
BACK. ONE KEY ISSUE IS THE

01:38:01.108 --> 01:38:02.309
PROGRAM'S LACK OF ACCESS TO

01:38:02.376 --> 01:38:03.911
PRODUCT INGREDIENT DATA.

01:38:03.978 --> 01:38:05.913
PROGRAM STAFF HAVE HAD TO RESORT

01:38:05.980 --> 01:38:07.281
TO GOOGLE SEARCHES AND

01:38:07.348 --> 01:38:08.716
UNSUCCESSFUL VOLUNTARY INDUSTRY

01:38:08.782 --> 01:38:10.818
REQUESTS TO GET INFORMATION ON

01:38:10.884 --> 01:38:12.386
PRODUCT INGREDIENTS.

01:38:12.453 --> 01:38:14.054
THE RESULT HAS BEEN LONG DELAYS

01:38:14.121 --> 01:38:15.756
AND HESITATION SIX TO CONSIDER

01:38:15.823 --> 01:38:17.358
ALL THE PRINCIPAL INGREDIENTS

01:38:17.424 --> 01:38:19.193
MAKING A PRODUCT AND SAFE.

01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:21.362
SB THREE NINE TO PROVIDE THE

01:38:21.428 --> 01:38:23.464
DEPARTMENT CLEARER STRONGER DATA

01:38:23.530 --> 01:38:24.965
COLLECTION AUTHORITY THE STILL

01:38:25.032 --> 01:38:26.300
PRESERVES THE TRADE SECRET

01:38:26.367 --> 01:38:27.835
PROTECTIONS ALREADY IN THE GREEN

01:38:27.901 --> 01:38:29.536
CHEMISTRY.

01:38:29.603 --> 01:38:30.604
THE SECOND ISSUE IS A LACK OF

01:38:30.671 --> 01:38:32.273
DEADLINES AND CLEAR REQUIREMENTS

01:38:32.339 --> 01:38:33.774
FOR THE PROGRAMS OUTLINED

01:38:33.841 --> 01:38:34.742
TIMELINES FOR ACTION.

01:38:34.808 --> 01:38:36.677
WHICH WOULD PROVIDE BUT

01:38:36.744 --> 01:38:38.612
TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:38:38.679 --> 01:38:39.480
THE CURRENT THREE YEAR WORK

01:38:39.546 --> 01:38:41.081
PLANS HAVE BEEN RATHER VAGUE

01:38:41.148 --> 01:38:42.216
THEY'RE NOT SPECIFIC ENOUGH TO

01:38:42.283 --> 01:38:43.417
BE MEANINGFUL AND THEY

01:38:43.484 --> 01:38:44.718
FACILITATE THE LENGTHY DELAYS

01:38:44.785 --> 01:38:45.986
THAT I'VE BEEN UNFORTUNATE

01:38:46.053 --> 01:38:47.488
FEATURE THE PROGRAM SO FAR.

01:38:47.554 --> 01:38:49.189
AND SB THREE NINE TWO WOULD

01:38:49.256 --> 01:38:51.091
REQUIRE THE AGENCY TO DEVELOP A

01:38:51.158 --> 01:38:58.799
WORK PLAN TO ADDRESS FIVE

01:38:58.866 --> 01:38:59.900
PRODUCT CATEGORIES OR SUB

01:38:59.967 --> 01:39:00.467
CATEGORIES IN FIVE YEARS.

01:39:00.534 --> 01:39:01.068
INCLUDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF

01:39:01.135 --> 01:39:02.503
TIMELINES FOR THE VARIOUS STEPS

01:39:02.569 --> 01:39:03.304
IN THE PROCESS.

01:39:03.370 --> 01:39:03.837
IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE

01:39:03.904 --> 01:39:04.471
CONSIDERATION OF ALL CHEMICALS

01:39:04.538 --> 01:39:05.105
THAT SERVE THE SAME PURPOSE OR

01:39:05.172 --> 01:39:05.606
FUNCTION TO ADDRESS THE

01:39:05.673 --> 01:39:07.508
REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTION.

01:39:07.574 --> 01:39:09.343
THAT SENATOR ALLEN ALLUDED.

01:39:09.410 --> 01:39:10.344
TO THESE MEASURES WILL PROVIDE

01:39:10.411 --> 01:39:11.445
CLEARER PROCESS IN

01:39:11.512 --> 01:39:13.514
ACCOUNTABILITY AND WILL ENSURE

01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:14.281
THE PROGRAM DOESN'T HAVE TO

01:39:14.348 --> 01:39:15.849
REVIEWS REVISIT THE PRODUCT A

01:39:15.916 --> 01:39:18.052
FEW YEARS TIME -- THESE

01:39:18.118 --> 01:39:19.486
IMPROVEMENTS WILL HELP WITH THE

01:39:19.553 --> 01:39:21.221
NEED FOR BETTER PRIORITIZATION

01:39:21.288 --> 01:39:23.157
TO THE PH I. REPORT OUTLINES.

01:39:23.223 --> 01:39:24.858
A THIRD FACTOR IS THE CURRENT

01:39:24.925 --> 01:39:26.460
LONG AND ONE SIZE FITS ALL

01:39:26.527 --> 01:39:27.695
APPROACH OF EVALUATING

01:39:27.761 --> 01:39:28.862
ALTERNATIVES TO THE CHEMICALS

01:39:28.929 --> 01:39:31.065
BEING ADDRESSED.

01:39:31.131 --> 01:39:32.900
CURRENTLY NEW COMPANY DRIVEN

01:39:32.966 --> 01:39:35.035
ANALYSES ARE REQUIRED FOR EVERY

01:39:35.102 --> 01:39:36.470
MANUFACTURER THAT PRODUCES A

01:39:36.537 --> 01:39:37.771
PRODUCT UNDER CONSIDERATION

01:39:37.838 --> 01:39:39.540
BEFORE THE AGENCY CAN ACT.

01:39:39.606 --> 01:39:40.808
EVEN WHEN INFORMATION --

01:39:40.874 --> 01:39:42.409
ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE FOR

01:39:42.476 --> 01:39:44.044
RELIABLE SOURCES.

A PROVISION THAT'S CURRENTLY IN

THE BILL -- WE HAVE SOME

01:42:46.226 --> 01:42:47.694
CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THAT MIGHT BE

SAME RIGOROUS CRITERIA THAT AN A

01:43:01.842 --> 01:43:03.544
THAT WE WOULD PRODUCE AS A

01:43:03.610 --> 01:43:04.912
RESPONSIBLE ENTITY FOR EXAMPLE.

01:43:04.978 --> 01:43:06.513
WOULD HAVE TO MEET SO THAT'S ONE

01:43:06.580 --> 01:43:08.515
AREA WHERE I THINK -- WE WE'D

01:43:08.582 --> 01:43:09.716
LIKE TO WORK WITH -- CENTER

01:43:09.783 --> 01:43:11.251

THAT USED A SINGLE SHOE FOR THE

01:43:16.023 --> 01:43:17.858
DATA CALLING PROVISION --

01:43:17.925 --> 01:43:20.093
FRANKLY I THINK THIS COULD BE

01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:21.261
HELPFUL FOR D. T. S. C. -- TO

01:43:21.328 --> 01:43:23.063
MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS

WOULD PROBABLY FIND THAT

01:43:45.218 --> 01:43:46.853
UNREASONABLE BUT SOME SORT OF

01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:48.755

I AM IS KIND OF SIMILAR IN

01:45:56.583 --> 01:45:57.818
CONCEPT TO THE A A THAT WOULD BE

01:45:57.884 --> 01:45:59.186
EVALUATED SO THAT WE'RE MAKING

01:45:59.252 --> 01:46:01.655
SURE THAT OUR EVALUATING THE

01:46:01.722 --> 01:46:02.622
VARIOUS TRADE OFFS YOU KNOW IF

01:46:02.689 --> 01:46:04.891
THE PRODUCT TOXICITY IS THE

01:46:04.958 --> 01:46:06.460
ISSUE FORTY TSC.

01:46:06.526 --> 01:46:08.195
BUT ALTERNATIVES ON MAY BE KIND

01:46:08.261 --> 01:46:09.930
OF FOCUSED MORE KIND OF AND

01:46:09.996 --> 01:46:11.431
CONCERNING A RELATIVE TO HUMAN

01:46:11.498 --> 01:46:12.833
HEALTH IMPACTS THERE WERE

01:46:12.899 --> 01:46:14.634
CONSIDERING THOSE TYPES OF TRADE

01:46:14.701 --> 01:46:16.136
OFFS ON AND TO AND WEEDING

01:46:16.203 --> 01:46:17.170
FACTORS.

01:46:17.237 --> 01:46:18.972
I'M ALSO WITH REGARD TO THE DATA

01:46:19.039 --> 01:46:21.274
CALL AND WE WOULD ALSO -- JUST

01:46:21.341 --> 01:46:23.009
ECHO AND THAT TOO I WANT TO MAKE

01:46:23.076 --> 01:46:24.111
SURE THAT WERE STRENGTHENING DAD

01:46:24.177 --> 01:46:25.245
BUILDING UPON SOME AUTHORITIES

01:46:25.312 --> 01:46:26.947
DO TO SEE ALREADY HAS.

01:46:27.013 --> 01:46:28.548
AND MAKING SURE THAT RELATIVE TO

01:46:28.615 --> 01:46:30.217
THAT UT IT'S REALLY CONFINED IN

01:46:30.283 --> 01:46:32.352
AND KIND OF FOCUSED ON ON THOSE

01:46:32.419 --> 01:46:33.987
PRIORITIES ON THAT PTC IS

01:46:34.054 --> 01:46:35.288
FOCUSED ON IN AND AROUND THE

01:46:35.355 --> 01:46:39.593
pJUST COME A BROAD FISHING

01:46:39.659 --> 01:46:41.661
EXPEDITION A WITHOUT FOCUS AND

01:46:41.728 --> 01:46:43.797
TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD ON THE

01:46:43.864 --> 01:46:51.705
PRIORITIES AT HAND.

01:46:51.772 --> 01:46:53.373
AB AND THEN FINALLY AGE WITH

01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:54.040
REGARD TO THE CHEMICALS LIST WE

01:46:54.107 --> 01:46:54.741
ALSO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE

01:46:54.808 --> 01:46:55.675
EXPANSION OF THAT.

01:46:55.742 --> 01:46:56.576
ARE CURRENTLY THE PROGRAM IS

01:46:56.643 --> 01:46:57.744
LOOKING OUT TO ANA CHEMICALS

01:46:57.811 --> 01:46:59.012
LISTS ARE THAT WILL EXCEED

01:46:59.079 --> 01:46:59.679
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED CHEMICALS SO

01:46:59.746 --> 01:47:00.447
TODAY NOT CAN EXTEND THAT WE'RE

01:47:00.514 --> 01:47:01.181
CONCERNED ABOUT THE PACE OF THE

01:47:01.248 --> 01:47:01.448
PROGRAM.

01:47:01.515 --> 01:47:02.582
ADDING ADDITIONAL CHEMICALS TO

01:47:02.649 --> 01:47:03.884
THAT MIX TO KIND OF CONSIDER FOR

01:47:03.950 --> 01:47:05.585
PRIVATIZATION YOU KNOW

01:47:05.652 --> 01:47:07.320
POTENTIALLY COULD HAVE -- AND

01:47:07.387 --> 01:47:09.289
EFFECTIVE ACTUALLY SLOWING DOWN

01:47:09.356 --> 01:47:10.824
THAT BUT NONE THE LESS -- SEEMS

01:47:10.891 --> 01:47:12.692

COMMUNITY IF YOU WILL -- TO

01:49:53.620 --> 01:49:55.255
EXPEDITE THE REVIEW -- OF

01:49:55.322 --> 01:49:59.025
CHEMICALS -- HOW DO WE ENSURE

01:49:59.092 --> 01:50:00.660
THAT -- WE'RE LOOKING AT PEER

01:50:00.727 --> 01:50:09.402
REVIEWED NON BIASED STUDIES.

01:50:09.469 --> 01:50:10.303
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION I MEAN I

01:50:10.370 --> 01:50:11.638
I I I MEAN IT DOES SAY

PAGE EIGHT OF THE BILL.

01:50:17.010 --> 01:50:17.944
DID ANY ANNOUNCES THE DEPARTURE

01:50:18.011 --> 01:50:19.045
LIES ON PRCEED SUBDIVISIONS OF

01:50:19.112 --> 01:50:20.280
ISSUE BY GOVERNMENT AGENCY OR

01:50:20.347 --> 01:50:21.414
CREDIBLE INSTITUTION WITH

01:50:21.481 --> 01:50:22.415
RELEVANT EXPERTISE IN WITHOUT

01:50:22.482 --> 01:50:23.783
FINANCIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

01:50:23.850 --> 01:50:25.585
OR PUBLISHED IN PEER REVIEWED

01:50:25.652 --> 01:50:28.388
SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE SELF -- IT

01:50:28.455 --> 01:50:30.023
IT IT LAYS OUT.

01:50:30.090 --> 01:50:31.391
THOSE HIGH STANDARDS THAT

01:50:31.458 --> 01:50:33.259
CERTAINLY.

01:50:33.326 --> 01:50:33.994
IF YOU WANT.

01:50:34.060 --> 01:50:35.462
TO STRENGTHEN THEM -- HAPPY TO

01:50:35.528 --> 01:50:35.929
HAVE THAT CONVERSATION

01:50:35.996 --> 01:50:36.229
[inaudible]

01:50:36.296 --> 01:50:39.399
YEAH.

01:50:39.466 --> 01:50:41.101
HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOUR MENTAL

01:50:41.167 --> 01:50:43.169
THING IS ONE OF THE CONCERNS OF

01:50:43.236 --> 01:50:45.739
ASSEMBLY MANUFACTURES YEAH --

01:50:45.805 --> 01:50:47.941
AND THEN -- I THINK THAT THE

01:50:48.008 --> 01:50:49.275
OPPONENTS OF BROUGHT UP A GOOD

01:50:49.342 --> 01:50:52.012
POINT -- HERE WE HAD TEN YEARS

01:50:52.078 --> 01:50:53.413
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED CHEMICALS

01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:56.516
AND WE HAVEN'T HAD -- ONE

01:50:56.583 --> 01:50:58.852
SIGNIFICANT REVIEW -- AND YET

01:50:58.918 --> 01:51:01.221
YOU WANT NOW ADD MORE --

01:51:01.287 --> 01:51:02.655
CHEMICALS TO THAT LIST WHICH IS

01:51:02.722 --> 01:51:04.591
GONNA DILUTES THE REVIEW OF THE

01:51:04.657 --> 01:51:07.193
EXISTING -- TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED

01:51:07.260 --> 01:51:08.128
ONE OF THE ONE OF THE UPPER

01:51:08.194 --> 01:51:10.363
OPPONENTS MENTIONED THAT -- AN

01:51:10.430 --> 01:51:12.499
ALLERGEN LESS FROM THE EUROPEAN

01:51:12.565 --> 01:51:14.200
UNION HAS BEEN BEEN ADDED WHICH

01:51:14.267 --> 01:51:15.802
MAY NOT RISE TO THE LEVEL THAT

01:51:15.869 --> 01:51:17.270
THE TSC SHOULD BE REVIEWING

01:51:17.337 --> 01:51:18.838
THOSE AT ALL.

01:51:18.905 --> 01:51:20.473
SO THERE IS A CONCERN ABOUT THE

01:51:20.540 --> 01:51:23.777
PACE OF THE PROGRAM CAN YOU CAN

01:51:23.843 --> 01:51:24.310
YOU.

01:51:24.377 --> 01:51:26.980
TALK ABOUT -- Y. EXPANDED THE

01:51:27.047 --> 01:51:28.581
LIST AND WHY THESE ALLERGENS YOU

01:51:28.648 --> 01:51:30.250
THINK ARE EFFICACIOUS TO BE

01:51:30.316 --> 01:51:32.919
ADDED TO THE LIST.

01:51:32.986 --> 01:51:34.687
I'LL LET ARMENIAN TO THE BOTH OF

01:51:34.754 --> 01:51:36.022
YOU REALIZE THEY DON'T HAVE TO

01:51:36.089 --> 01:51:36.689
REVIEW THE CHEMICALS AND THIS IS

01:51:36.756 --> 01:51:38.758
JUST THIS YOU KNOW WE WOULD TALK

01:51:38.825 --> 01:51:40.193
ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND SO --

01:51:40.260 --> 01:51:41.361
SO MIND CHEMICALS OF COMMERCE

01:51:41.428 --> 01:51:43.063
ITSELF RIGHT IS A VERY SMALL

01:51:43.129 --> 01:51:45.465
ADDITION IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT A

01:51:45.532 --> 01:51:46.766
BROADER CONTEXT AND GRANT THEM

01:51:46.833 --> 01:51:48.501
IT JUST IT JUST ADDS TO THE IF

01:51:48.568 --> 01:51:50.570
YOU GIVE A LITTLE MORE THEY CAN

01:51:50.637 --> 01:51:51.838
REVIEW.

01:51:51.905 --> 01:51:53.373
BY ADOPTION I WE CAN.

01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:53.807
YEAH.

01:51:53.873 --> 01:51:54.808
AS A CENTER SAYS IT JUST ALLOWS

01:51:54.874 --> 01:51:55.542
AND TO CONSIDER THE CHEMICALS

01:51:55.608 --> 01:51:56.976
THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE THEM TO ACT

01:51:57.043 --> 01:51:57.877
ON IT AND SO GIVES YOU MORE

01:51:57.944 --> 01:51:59.412
CHOICE I THINK ABOUT IT BUT THE

01:51:59.479 --> 01:52:00.780
ONLY PRIORITIZE CHEMICALS.

01:52:00.847 --> 01:52:02.982
WHICH POSE A HEALTH RISK AND

01:52:03.049 --> 01:52:04.884
THAT RISE TO THAT LEVEL SOME OF

01:52:04.951 --> 01:52:07.353
THESE ALLERGENS CAN BE A AS A

01:52:07.420 --> 01:52:08.788
RISKS AND SO RIGHT HAVING IT IN

01:52:08.855 --> 01:52:09.756
THERE ARE LAWS AND TO CONSIDER

01:52:09.823 --> 01:52:10.957
THOSE REST IF THEY RISE TO THAT

01:52:11.024 --> 01:52:11.858
LEVEL BUT I DON'T HAVE TO DO

01:52:11.925 --> 01:52:12.058
THAT.

01:52:12.125 --> 01:52:13.259
OKAY BUT YOU'RE STILL EXPANDING

01:52:13.326 --> 01:52:15.261
THE THE SCOPE OF WHAT THEY CAN

01:52:15.328 --> 01:52:15.962
INVESTIGATE WHICH THEY CAN

01:52:16.029 --> 01:52:17.197
CONSIDER TAKE AWAY FROM MAYBE

01:52:17.263 --> 01:52:18.031
SOME OF THE MORE DANGEROUS

01:52:18.098 --> 01:52:19.599
CHEMICALS WHICH IS A CONCERN.

01:52:19.666 --> 01:52:21.067
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A RATING

01:52:21.134 --> 01:52:23.403
SYSTEM AMONG THE CHEMICALS --

01:52:23.470 --> 01:52:26.339
THAT MIGHT GUIDE THE DTS SEE TO

01:52:26.406 --> 01:52:27.507
SPEND THE RESOURCES ARE

01:52:27.574 --> 01:52:28.741
APPROPRIATELY NESSA'S BILL

01:52:28.808 --> 01:52:30.343
CLINTON ANYMORE STAFF WELL I

01:52:30.410 --> 01:52:31.778
THINK THAT THE TSC IS A DECK TO

01:52:31.845 --> 01:52:32.879
AGENCY WITH EXPERTISE ON THIS

01:52:32.946 --> 01:52:34.481
TOPIC AND THEY PRIORITIZE

01:52:34.547 --> 01:52:36.082
INTERNALLY LA THAT PRIORITIZE

01:52:36.149 --> 01:52:37.750
ASIAN OUT IN THE WORK PLANS THAT

01:52:37.817 --> 01:52:38.651
THEY PUT TOGETHER.

01:52:38.718 --> 01:52:39.519
AND SO THEY HAVE TO LAY OUT A

01:52:39.586 --> 01:52:40.720
RATIONALE FOR WHY THEY'RE

01:52:40.787 --> 01:52:41.788
DRESSING THE PARTICULAR SECTOR

01:52:41.855 --> 01:52:43.022
CHEMICALS A PRODUCT THAT THEY

01:52:43.089 --> 01:52:44.057
ARE AND IT WOULD HAVE TO DO THAT

01:52:44.124 --> 01:52:46.059
SO -- WE WE THINK IT'S FAIRLY

01:52:46.126 --> 01:52:48.128
UNLIKELY THAT THEY WOULD TAKE

01:52:48.194 --> 01:52:49.395
SOMETHING THAT'S A MINOR HEALTH

01:52:49.462 --> 01:52:50.964
CONCERN AND PUT IN THE WORK.

01:52:51.030 --> 01:52:52.632
WE ALSO -- AND THEN LASTLY --

01:52:52.699 --> 01:52:54.067
WHILE HAS BEEN DISCUSSED HERE

01:52:54.134 --> 01:52:55.235
WAS DISCUSSING SOME OF THE

01:52:55.301 --> 01:52:55.935
MEETINGS THAT HAVE A SOME OF THE

01:52:56.002 --> 01:52:57.570
MANUFACTURERS CAN YOU -- TALK

01:52:57.637 --> 01:53:00.440
ABOUT -- THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF

01:53:00.507 --> 01:53:01.274
SOME OF THOSE INGREDIENTS THAT

01:53:01.341 --> 01:53:04.210
ARE PROPRIETARY IN NATURE THAT

01:53:04.277 --> 01:53:06.079
OBVIOUSLY THE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU

01:53:06.146 --> 01:53:06.779
IF YOU GOT A PRODUCT I'M GONNA

01:53:06.846 --> 01:53:10.150
THROW ANOTHER WD FORTY OKAY WELL

01:53:10.216 --> 01:53:10.416
YOU KNOW.

01:53:10.483 --> 01:53:11.618
I DON'T THINK THE PROPRIETORS OF

01:53:11.684 --> 01:53:12.218
MANUFACTURES THAT PRODUCT ONE

01:53:12.285 --> 01:53:13.386
OUT THE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS THAT

01:53:13.453 --> 01:53:14.721
ARE OF THEIR PUBLICIZING MAYBE

01:53:14.787 --> 01:53:15.822
SOMETHING IS VERY SIMPLE MAYBE

01:53:15.889 --> 01:53:16.956
SOME A COMPLICATED.

01:53:17.023 --> 01:53:17.824
BUT HOW DO WE PROTECT THE

01:53:17.891 --> 01:53:20.493
MANUFACTURERS FROM SOME OF THEIR

01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:22.095
THERE'S THEIR PROPER I REMEMBER

01:53:22.162 --> 01:53:22.862
ONE NIGHT WHEN THIS BILL IS VERY

01:53:22.929 --> 01:53:24.764
FIRST PITCH TO ME BY MY BY MY

01:53:24.831 --> 01:53:26.499
STAFF MY FANTASTIC STAFFER HERE

01:53:26.566 --> 01:53:27.100
TEAM THAT THAT WAS THE FIRST

01:53:27.167 --> 01:53:28.468
QUESTION I ASKED HOW DO WE MAKE

01:53:28.535 --> 01:53:29.035
SURE WE PROTECT.

01:53:29.102 --> 01:53:41.681
ON A TRADE SECRETS AND AND

01:53:41.748 --> 01:53:43.583
PREPARE TO INFORMATION AND THEY

01:53:43.650 --> 01:53:44.617
HAVE A THEY BASICALLY HAVE A

01:53:44.684 --> 01:53:45.285
SYSTEM IN PLACE I'M SURE ONE OF

01:53:45.351 --> 01:53:46.286
THE ONE OF YOU GUYS CAN DESCRIBE

01:53:46.352 --> 01:53:47.187
IT BUT IT.

01:53:47.253 --> 01:53:48.087
GOVERNMENT ASKED.

01:53:48.154 --> 01:53:48.721
FOR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION ALL

01:53:48.788 --> 01:53:49.389
THE TIME -- AND THERE'S A STRICT

01:53:49.455 --> 01:53:50.590
PROCEDURE IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE

01:53:50.657 --> 01:53:51.524
THAT IT DOESN'T GET A SHARED AND

01:53:51.591 --> 01:53:53.993
AND AND AND AND AND THAT THAT

01:53:54.060 --> 01:53:54.994
THAT OF THE DOES TRADE SECRETS

01:53:55.061 --> 01:53:56.396
ARE ARE NOT COMPROMISE BUT AND

01:53:56.462 --> 01:53:57.664
IF YOU WANNA SPEAK.

01:53:57.730 --> 01:53:58.698
YEAH JUST A ONE ONE QUICK

01:53:58.765 --> 01:53:59.332
ADDITION THANK YOU SENATOR WHICH

01:53:59.399 --> 01:54:00.066
IS THAT THEY'RE ALREADY TRADE

01:54:00.133 --> 01:54:00.833
SECRET PROTECTIONS BUILT INTO

01:54:00.900 --> 01:54:01.734
THE GREEN CHEMISTRY Là AND THEY

01:54:01.801 --> 01:54:02.802
WILL CONTINUE TO APPLY TO THESE

01:54:02.869 --> 01:54:03.269
PROVISIONS AND THAT.

01:54:03.336 --> 01:54:04.637
WE HAVE BEEN VISION THAT THE

01:54:04.704 --> 01:54:06.239
THAT WAY THROUGHOUT AND IF WE

01:54:06.306 --> 01:54:07.207
WIN THIS ANY PROBLEMS IN THE

01:54:07.273 --> 01:54:08.341
PAST -- ANY TRADE SECRETS BEING

01:54:08.408 --> 01:54:08.975
WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING TO THAT

01:54:09.042 --> 01:54:10.210
EFFECT AND OF COURSE GOVERNMENT

01:54:10.276 --> 01:54:11.311
AGENCIES YOU KNOW THEY THEY

01:54:11.377 --> 01:54:12.512
STILL GET INFORMATION AND THE

01:54:12.579 --> 01:54:13.146
STILL HAVE TO KEEP THEM SECRET

01:54:13.213 --> 01:54:13.780
AND THAT THE AGENT AGENCY WOULD

01:54:13.846 --> 01:54:19.018
BE UNDER THAT RESPONSIBILITY --

01:54:19.085 --> 01:54:19.652
AND WE THINK THEY'RE CAPABLE OF

01:54:19.719 --> 01:54:21.588
MEETING THAT.

01:54:21.654 --> 01:54:23.022
YOUR ANSWERS IF.

01:54:23.089 --> 01:54:24.724
ETCETERA WE COULD YOU CLARIFY

01:54:24.791 --> 01:54:26.659
THERE IS THE AMERICAN COVER

01:54:26.726 --> 01:54:27.827
CHEMICALS ASSOCIATION --

01:54:27.894 --> 01:54:28.561
TESTIFIED THAT THERE IS A

01:54:28.628 --> 01:54:30.563
PROCESS FOR THE CHEMICALS OF

01:54:30.630 --> 01:54:32.599
CONCERN ABOUT LIST TO BE

01:54:32.665 --> 01:54:34.601
EXPANDED CLEARLY INDUSTRY

01:54:34.667 --> 01:54:36.502
DOESN'T WANT TO BE NOBODY WANTS

01:54:36.569 --> 01:54:38.471
TO BE ON THE LIST ARE PART.

01:54:38.538 --> 01:54:39.839
OF WHATEVER IT IS SENT BACK BUT

01:54:39.906 --> 01:54:41.874
CLARIFY WHAT THE IS IT IN

01:54:41.941 --> 01:54:43.876
CUMBERSOME THE PROCESS THAT

01:54:43.943 --> 01:54:46.079
EXIST RIGHT NOW TO EXPAND THE

01:54:46.145 --> 01:54:47.880
LIST -- WITH THE UNDERSTANDING

01:54:47.947 --> 01:54:48.715
THAT.

01:54:48.781 --> 01:54:50.283
THIS PROGRAM WAS NEVER DESIGNED

01:54:50.350 --> 01:54:51.918
FOR ALL TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED

01:54:51.985 --> 01:54:53.486
CHEMICALS TO GO FOR THE REVIEW

01:54:53.553 --> 01:54:54.988
PROCESS SO THAT'S SAID SO THAT'S

01:54:55.054 --> 01:54:56.389
THAT BUT THAT BUT GIVEN THE

01:54:56.456 --> 01:54:58.891
CURRENT PROCESS THAT THEY HAVE

01:54:58.958 --> 01:54:59.792
FOR FOR OPTING IN.

01:54:59.859 --> 01:55:01.027
WHAT'S THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THAT

01:55:01.094 --> 01:55:05.098
THAT THAT WE WANT TO GIVE THE

01:55:05.164 --> 01:55:07.033
DETAILS SEE THE AUTHORITY.

01:55:07.100 --> 01:55:09.068
WELL I I I I MEAN I I THINK THAT

01:55:09.135 --> 01:55:09.669
THIS THE CURRENT SHORTCOMINGS

01:55:09.736 --> 01:55:11.804
ARE THE I WELL I I THINK I WILL

01:55:11.871 --> 01:55:14.040
BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE DID YOU SEE

01:55:14.107 --> 01:55:14.674
THERE THE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS

01:55:14.741 --> 01:55:16.142
RIGHT.

01:55:16.209 --> 01:55:18.177
AND THEY CAN'T POSSIBLY

01:55:18.244 --> 01:55:19.078
INVESTIGATE EVERY SINGLE

01:55:19.145 --> 01:55:20.480
CHEMICAL WITH THE LEVEL OF

01:55:20.546 --> 01:55:22.782
SCRUTINY I THINK THAT.

01:55:22.849 --> 01:55:24.183
SOME OF US WOULD -- WOULD HOPE

01:55:24.250 --> 01:55:25.184
THAT THEY ARE BUT THEY'RE

01:55:25.251 --> 01:55:26.152
THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE

01:55:26.219 --> 01:55:27.153
ABLE TO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO

01:55:27.220 --> 01:55:28.021
IT.

01:55:28.087 --> 01:55:29.088
BUT WE WANT WE CERTAINLY WANT TO

01:55:29.155 --> 01:55:30.056
GIVE THAT THEY NEED TO GO

01:55:30.123 --> 01:55:31.758
THROUGH THEIR OWN PRIVATIZATION

01:55:31.824 --> 01:55:32.792
INTERNALLY AND THEY DO.

01:55:32.859 --> 01:55:34.394
THAT THE THE THE FOCUS ON THE

01:55:34.460 --> 01:55:34.927
CHEMICALS THAT ARE MOST

01:55:34.994 --> 01:55:36.896
CONCERNED ABOUT BUT WE CERTAINLY

01:55:36.963 --> 01:55:38.731
HAVE FELTAS THOUGH THE LIST OF

01:55:38.798 --> 01:55:39.599
CHEMICALS THAT WE'VE ADDED THAT

01:55:39.666 --> 01:55:41.234
HAVE RAISED CONCERNS OTHER

01:55:41.301 --> 01:55:43.436
PLACES -- YOU KNOW ARE ARE

01:55:43.503 --> 01:55:47.573
WORTHY OF OF ELIGIBILITY FOR

01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:50.143
CONSIDERATION BY THE TNC -- BUT

01:55:50.209 --> 01:55:50.777
ONCE AGAIN THAT IT DOES NOT SAY

01:55:50.843 --> 01:55:52.245
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH

01:55:52.312 --> 01:55:53.146
THE KIND OF ROBUST ANNOUNCES

01:55:53.212 --> 01:55:54.480
THAT I THINK A LOT OF CONSUMERS

01:55:54.547 --> 01:55:55.048
EXPECTED THEY'RE GOING TO GO

01:55:55.114 --> 01:55:57.317
THROUGH -- BUT IT DOES IT DOES

01:55:57.383 --> 01:55:57.884
GIVE.

01:55:57.950 --> 01:55:59.886
ITGIVES IT GIVES THEM THE RIGHT

01:55:59.952 --> 01:56:01.654
TO TO DO THE INVESTIGATION --

01:56:01.721 --> 01:56:04.290
THAT THEY WOULD FIND A SORRY IF

01:56:04.357 --> 01:56:04.924
THEY IF THEY FOUND IT NECESSARY

01:56:04.991 --> 01:56:07.126
THAT.

01:56:07.193 --> 01:56:08.461
OKAY YES CENTER SKINNER.

01:56:08.528 --> 01:56:10.296
OKAY.

01:56:10.363 --> 01:56:12.799
THANK YOU -- I APPRECIATE BUT

01:56:12.865 --> 01:56:13.700
ADDING TO THE LIST BECAUSE AS

01:56:13.766 --> 01:56:15.835
YOU POINTED OUT.

01:56:15.902 --> 01:56:17.203
AS THE AUTHOR POINTED OUT IT

01:56:17.270 --> 01:56:20.006
DOESN'T REQUIRE THE DTS SEE.

01:56:20.073 --> 01:56:22.442
TO BUT IT ALLOWS THEM TO NOT

01:56:22.508 --> 01:56:23.976
HAVE TO GO THROUGH ADDITIONAL

01:56:24.043 --> 01:56:25.378
PROCESS SEES.

01:56:25.445 --> 01:56:27.280
TO ADD AND I THINK THE

01:56:27.347 --> 01:56:30.049
IMPORTANCE OF THAT IS THAT NEW

01:56:30.116 --> 01:56:31.351
RESEARCH.

01:56:31.417 --> 01:56:33.486
COMES FORWARD ALL THE TIME NOW

01:56:33.553 --> 01:56:35.922
WHILE -- WHILE OUR GREEN

01:56:35.988 --> 01:56:40.960
CHEMISTRY PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE

01:56:41.027 --> 01:56:43.363
ROUNDUP WAS CONSIDERED VERY SAFE

01:56:43.429 --> 01:56:46.032
UP UNTIL MAYBE TWELVE FIFTEEN

01:56:46.099 --> 01:56:48.768
YEARS AGO WHEN RESEARCH BEGAN TO

01:56:48.835 --> 01:56:52.372
SHOW -- A GOOD AMOUNT OF

01:56:52.438 --> 01:56:54.207
INDICATORS THAT OULD CAUSE

01:56:54.273 --> 01:56:55.675
PEOPLE TO REASSESS IT AND

01:56:55.742 --> 01:56:59.178
FURTHER MANY MORE STUDIES DUE TO

01:56:59.245 --> 01:57:00.980
OCCUR SINCE THAT TIME.

01:57:01.047 --> 01:57:03.583
SIMILARLY IF WE TAKE -- BPA

01:57:03.649 --> 01:57:05.918
WHILE WE OF WELL THERE'S BEEN A

01:57:05.985 --> 01:57:10.156
CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF ITS --

01:57:10.223 --> 01:57:13.092
PROBLEMS OF LEACHING INTO FOOD

01:57:13.159 --> 01:57:15.528
FOR EXAMPLE IN IT AS FOR USE AS

01:57:15.595 --> 01:57:17.930
A HAND ALIGNING IN CANS.

01:57:17.997 --> 01:57:20.333
AND FOOD CANS AND IN BABY

01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:22.602
BOTTLES THERE WAS LITTLE TO NO

01:57:22.668 --> 01:57:25.104
CONCERN ABOUT THE FACT THAT.

01:57:25.171 --> 01:57:31.611
OUR THE RECEIPTS THAT COME OFF

01:57:31.677 --> 01:57:32.545
OF THE HEAT.

01:57:32.612 --> 01:57:33.179
BASICALLY WHEN USE YOUR CREDIT

01:57:33.246 --> 01:57:33.780
CARD NOW PRETTY MCH ALL

01:57:33.846 --> 01:57:36.015
RECEIPTS ARE PRODUCED THROUGH UP

01:57:36.082 --> 01:57:38.317
HE PROCESS AND THAT REQUIRES THE

01:57:38.384 --> 01:57:41.387
BPA AND WHAT IS NOW RESEARCH IS

01:57:41.454 --> 01:57:42.655
NO SHOWN.

01:57:42.722 --> 01:57:45.291
THAT THAT IS THEN TRANSFERRED TO

01:57:45.358 --> 01:57:47.059
YOUR SKIN THE LARGEST ORGAN OF

01:57:47.126 --> 01:57:48.561
YOUR BODY AND YOU CAN'T HAVE

01:57:48.628 --> 01:57:50.997
IMPLICATIONS BUT FURTHER.

01:57:51.063 --> 01:57:51.864
FURTHER WHICH IS VERY

01:57:51.931 --> 01:57:54.300
INTERESTING IS THAT THE BPA OFF

01:57:54.367 --> 01:57:56.202
THOSE RECEIPTS COMBINED WITH IF

01:57:56.269 --> 01:57:59.672
YOU USE HAND SANITIZER.

01:57:59.739 --> 01:58:02.909
EXACERBATES THE THE ARE

01:58:02.975 --> 01:58:06.512
HAZARDOUS -- IMPACTS OF THE BPA

01:58:06.579 --> 01:58:09.849
ON ON YOUR PHYSIOLOGY ANYWAY SO

01:58:09.916 --> 01:58:11.217
THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS

01:58:11.284 --> 01:58:12.752
THAT.

01:58:12.819 --> 01:58:14.821
ALRIGHT WE CAN'T EXPECT ONE A

01:58:14.887 --> 01:58:17.790
SINGLE STATE AGENCY TO BE ABLE

01:58:17.857 --> 01:58:19.258
TO COMPREHENSIVELY STUDY.

01:58:19.325 --> 01:58:22.295
BUT IF THERE IS LEGITIMATE

01:58:22.361 --> 01:58:24.564
SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH -- THEN IT

01:58:24.630 --> 01:58:28.267
ALLOWS DTS SEE TO ELEVATE THAT

01:58:28.334 --> 01:58:30.870
PARTICULAR CHEMICAL AND BEGIN TO

01:58:30.937 --> 01:58:33.139
GO THROUGH THEIR PROCESS -- AND

01:58:33.206 --> 01:58:35.575
ALLOWS THEM TO RELY ON GOOD

01:58:35.641 --> 01:58:37.210
SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH SO.

01:58:37.276 --> 01:58:38.978
I I THINK THE BILL IS GOING IN A

01:58:39.045 --> 01:58:40.446
VERY GOOD DIRECTION.

01:58:40.513 --> 01:58:42.882
I DO THINK THAT WE WANT TO MAKE

01:58:42.949 --> 01:58:45.384
AS SOLID AS POSSIBLE THE ANY

01:58:45.451 --> 01:58:46.786
LANGUAGE THAT REFERENCES THE

01:58:46.853 --> 01:58:48.521
STUDIES WOULD RELY ON BECAUSE WE

01:58:48.588 --> 01:58:50.756
WANT TO KNOW THAT THOSE STUDIES

01:58:50.823 --> 01:58:52.058
ARE VALID.

01:58:52.124 --> 01:58:54.994
SO AND I AM GOING TO TRUST THAT

01:58:55.061 --> 01:58:56.295
THE AUTHORS HEARD.

01:58:56.362 --> 01:58:57.597
BOTH THE COMMITTEE'S CONCERNS

01:58:57.663 --> 01:58:59.365
AND THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS

01:58:59.432 --> 01:59:01.133
AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON

01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:05.071
THAT LANGUAGE -- IN WITH THAT I

01:59:05.137 --> 01:59:06.439
WILL -- MOVED THE BILL.

01:59:06.506 --> 01:59:08.741
MEASURES BEEN MOVED.

YOU MAY CLOSE SENATOR ALAN WHAT

01:59:10.676 --> 01:59:12.612
BRUSCHI THE QUESTIONS AND AND

01:59:12.678 --> 01:59:14.080
AND I DO APPRECIATE THE THE

01:59:14.146 --> 01:59:15.615
PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION THAT.

01:59:15.681 --> 01:59:17.149
MY STAFF HAD WITH WITH SOME

01:59:17.216 --> 01:59:18.651

THAT WE ALL ATTENDED I RAISE

01:59:29.295 --> 01:59:30.596
SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE

01:59:30.663 --> 01:59:32.865
EXTENT TO WHICH OUR CURRENT.

I JUST WANT TO KNOW ANNOUNCED MY

02:00:49.575 --> 02:00:51.611
CANDIDACY FOR PRESIDENCY IN THAT

02:00:51.677 --> 02:00:54.480
COMMITTEE BECAUSE THEIR PEAK --

02:00:54.547 --> 02:00:56.782
THAT REPRESENTS LESS PEOPLE THAN

02:00:56.849 --> 02:00:59.218
VAN NUYS I REPRESENT VAN I SAY

02:00:59.285 --> 02:01:04.924
FIGURE WHAT THE HECK YEAH.

02:01:04.991 --> 02:01:08.894
THOUGH IN A LOW.

02:01:08.961 --> 02:01:11.397
EVERYONE WHO THE BETTER WE WILL

02:01:11.464 --> 02:01:14.333
GO OVER THE GASKETS THAT.

02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:16.202
WE MAY PERCEIVE THAT ON SB THREE

02:01:16.268 --> 02:01:17.236
THIRTY TWO THIS IS A SMALL

02:01:17.303 --> 02:01:19.639
SIMPLE BILL.

02:01:19.705 --> 02:01:20.906
YES MUCH OF THE BILL.

02:01:20.973 --> 02:01:23.275
SO IN YEARS AGO WHEN -- SENATOR

02:01:23.342 --> 02:01:25.378
BYRON SHEER WAS STAFFED BY

02:01:25.444 --> 02:01:26.379
SENATOR KIP LIPPER.

02:01:26.445 --> 02:01:27.847
THAT WE ALL KNOW.

02:01:27.913 --> 02:01:28.848
FARM THEY CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA

02:01:28.914 --> 02:01:29.849
OF A RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO

02:01:29.915 --> 02:01:32.051
STANDARD TO DEAL WITH ENERGY IN

02:01:32.118 --> 02:01:34.654
OTHER WORDS AS A POLICY MATTER.

02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:36.889
HOW DO WE START MOVING IN THE

02:01:36.956 --> 02:01:39.258
ENERGY FIELD WITHOUT PICKING

02:01:39.325 --> 02:01:41.560
WINNERS OR LOSERS BUT IS A STATE

02:01:41.627 --> 02:01:42.962
POLICY TO ADOPT A RENEWABLE

02:01:43.029 --> 02:01:45.264
PORTFOLIO STANDARD THAT WAS 20%?

02:01:45.331 --> 02:01:47.433
NOW IT'S 2000% BUT THAT'S HOW

02:01:47.500 --> 02:01:48.734
POLITICS WORKS.

02:01:48.801 --> 02:01:51.771
AND SO IN THE FIELD OF WHAT HER

02:01:51.837 --> 02:01:54.240
WHICH IS AS IMPORTANT I WOULD

02:01:54.306 --> 02:01:55.641
ARGUE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT.

02:01:55.708 --> 02:01:57.543
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS

02:01:57.610 --> 02:01:59.712
INSTEAD OF TREATING WATER AS

02:01:59.779 --> 02:02:02.214
WASTE ONE TIME USE?

02:02:02.281 --> 02:02:05.384
BUT TO LITERALLY CREATED OUR PS.

02:02:05.451 --> 02:02:07.086
FOR WATER IT'S VERY SIMILAR KIND

02:02:07.153 --> 02:02:08.487
OF DYNAMIC WE'RE SAYING BY

02:02:08.554 --> 02:02:12.058
JANUARY 1203050% OF THIS WATER

02:02:12.124 --> 02:02:13.325
GOING ARE THESE WASTE WATER

02:02:13.392 --> 02:02:16.562
FACILITIES HAS TO BE RECYCLED.

02:02:16.629 --> 02:02:18.197
NOW WHAT DOES THAT EAN WHAT

02:02:18.264 --> 02:02:19.532
HAPPENS NOW IS IN THE FEDERAL

02:02:19.598 --> 02:02:20.433
LAW.

02:02:20.499 --> 02:02:22.868
WE BASICALLY IN LARGE MEASURE IN

02:02:22.935 --> 02:02:25.204
THE AREA THAT I'M FROM IN

02:02:25.271 --> 02:02:28.441
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA -- STICK A

02:02:28.507 --> 02:02:29.108
STRONG THE CALLER RIVER WE STICK

02:02:29.175 --> 02:02:30.743
A STRAW NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WE

02:02:30.810 --> 02:02:32.745
USE THE WATER ONCE WE HAVE TO

02:02:32.812 --> 02:02:34.480
CLEAN IT UP TO FEDERAL STANDARDS

02:02:34.547 --> 02:02:36.082
BEFORE WE PUT IN THE OCEAN.

02:02:36.148 --> 02:02:37.683
AND THEN WE PUT IN THE OCEAN.

02:02:37.750 --> 02:02:40.920
WE PUT IN THE OCEAN LOS ANGELES.

02:02:40.986 --> 02:02:42.755
ALMOST AS MUCH WATER AS WE

02:02:42.822 --> 02:02:45.291
IMPORT. FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY

02:02:45.357 --> 02:02:46.592
THOUSAND ACRE FEET.

02:02:46.659 --> 02:02:49.061
WHY CAN'T WE TAKE THAT WATER

02:02:49.128 --> 02:02:50.429
THAT GOES TO THOSE FACILITIES IS

02:02:50.496 --> 02:02:53.065
ALREADY CLEANED UP AND RECYCLING

02:02:53.132 --> 02:02:54.533
THE MAYOR OF LOS ANGELES SAYS

02:02:54.600 --> 02:02:57.169
WITH A LARGE FACILITY IN LOS

02:02:57.236 --> 02:02:58.070
ANGELES HYPERION?

02:02:58.137 --> 02:03:00.039
HE'S GOING TO DO THAT.

02:03:00.106 --> 02:03:01.941
OKAY THAT'S GOOD.

02:03:02.007 --> 02:03:03.776
THERE'S A STATE POLICY WHY CAN'T

02:03:03.843 --> 02:03:05.711
WE BEGIN TO TREAT WATER IS A

02:03:05.778 --> 02:03:06.846
PRECIOUS RESOURCE.

02:03:06.912 --> 02:03:09.949
SUPPORT AND FIRST BECAUSE IT IS.

02:03:10.015 --> 02:03:11.450
IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE FROM

02:03:11.517 --> 02:03:12.785
ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT WERE

02:03:12.852 --> 02:03:13.986
STEALING WATER FROM THE

02:03:14.053 --> 02:03:16.422
ENVIRONMENT IN MANY PLACES AND

02:03:16.489 --> 02:03:18.524
JUST DUMP IT IN THE OCEAN -- IN

02:03:18.591 --> 02:03:19.558
WE'RE DOING THAT POLITICALLY

02:03:19.625 --> 02:03:21.127
WORD THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

02:03:21.193 --> 02:03:22.361
PEOPLE ON THIS COMMITTEE OR

02:03:22.428 --> 02:03:23.395
PISSED AT US.

02:03:23.462 --> 02:03:24.897
OFTEN BECAUSE WE'RE STILL IN

02:03:24.964 --> 02:03:27.066
WATER AND DISRESPECTED PEOPLE

02:03:27.133 --> 02:03:28.234
FROM IMPERIAL IRRIGATION

02:03:28.300 --> 02:03:30.369
DISTRICT ACOSTA COASTAL CENTER

02:03:30.436 --> 02:03:31.570
PISSED AT US.

02:03:31.637 --> 02:03:33.205
WE NEED TO BE RESPONSIBLE WE

02:03:33.272 --> 02:03:34.774
NEED TO TREAT WATER WITH GREAT

02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:38.377
RESPECT AND WE CAN DO IT THE

02:03:38.444 --> 02:03:39.044
TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS US TO DO IT.

02:03:39.111 --> 02:03:39.779
THERE'S A LOT OF MOVEMENT

02:03:39.845 --> 02:03:41.180
FORWARD TO IT.

02:03:41.247 --> 02:03:42.548
THERE'S OVER A MILLION AND A

02:03:42.615 --> 02:03:44.016
HALF ACRE FEET OF WATERTHE GUNS

02:03:44.083 --> 02:03:45.518
DUMPED IN THE ALL BILL OCEAN

02:03:45.584 --> 02:03:47.119
ANNUAL BASIS FROM THESE VARIOUS

02:03:47.186 --> 02:03:48.220
FACILITIES.

02:03:48.287 --> 02:03:50.122
AND WE CAN DRAMATICALLY SHIFT

02:03:50.189 --> 02:03:52.625
HOW WE DEAL WITH WATER POLICY SO

02:03:52.691 --> 02:03:54.093
WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THIS MEASURES

02:03:54.160 --> 02:03:56.796
JUST TAKE THAT FIRST STEP LIKE

02:03:56.862 --> 02:03:58.264
SENATOR.

02:03:58.330 --> 02:03:59.665
SHEERAN SENATOR LIPPER DID BACK

THEN -- YOU KNOW AND SAY WE'RE

02:04:02.334 --> 02:04:03.569
GOING TO SET THESE STANDARDS.

02:04:03.636 --> 02:04:05.571
A IN IN TERMS OF THAT POCESS

02:04:05.638 --> 02:04:06.739
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

02:04:06.806 --> 02:04:08.440
IN THIS BILL I DID A BILL A FEW

02:04:08.507 --> 02:04:09.441
YEARS AGO JUST TO GET READY TO

02:04:09.508 --> 02:04:10.576
AREA THAT SAID YOU COULDN'T PUT

02:04:10.643 --> 02:04:11.677
WATER IN THE OCEAN.

02:04:11.744 --> 02:04:13.612
I JUST DID IT ON PURPOSE TO MAKE

02:04:13.679 --> 02:04:14.747
A LOT OF NOISE AND NOW THIS YEAR

02:04:14.814 --> 02:04:16.849
IS SEPARATE WHERE I THINK IT

02:04:16.916 --> 02:04:18.350
REALLY MAKES SOME SENSE.

02:04:18.417 --> 02:04:19.685
AND I KNOW THAT THIS ONE SIZE

02:04:19.752 --> 02:04:22.354
FITS ALL THOSE GREAT SOME-PROBLEMS FOR FOLKS.

02:04:22.421 --> 02:04:25.191
BUT IT IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE

02:04:25.257 --> 02:04:27.960
BATES.

02:04:28.027 --> 02:04:30.262
ARTICLE CASKEY SAID IT IS VERY

02:04:30.329 --> 02:04:31.730
SIMILAR. TO THE WAY WE HAD MANY

EVERYBODY THAT'S WE'RE TRYING TO

02:04:39.839 --> 02:04:43.475

02:05:54.546 --> 02:05:55.781
BECAUSE IMPLEMENTATION WILL

02:05:55.848 --> 02:05:56.982

BILL'S GOING -- BUT WE NEED A

02:08:45.417 --> 02:08:46.985
BRIDGE TO GET THERE THAT RIGHT

02:08:47.052 --> 02:08:47.886
NOW WE DON'T HAVE THE

02:08:47.953 --> 02:08:49.588

DRUG PORTABLE REDUCE REGULATIONS

02:09:08.774 --> 02:09:09.708
AND THAT IN OUR MIND IS THE

02:09:09.775 --> 02:09:11.944
BRIDGE THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO

02:09:12.010 --> 02:09:13.278

HAVE A GROUNDWATER BASIN SAN

02:09:25.924 --> 02:09:27.659
DIEGO FOR EXAMPLE -- TO BE ABLE

02:09:27.726 --> 02:09:29.128
TO PUT THAT STORE THAT WATER IN

02:09:29.194 --> 02:09:30.829
IN A RESERVOIR RATHER THAN I'M

02:09:30.896 --> 02:09:32.131

IS COMPLEXITY TO IT WE

02:10:42.234 --> 02:10:44.136
UNDERSTAND BECAUSE WHERE WE ARE

02:10:44.203 --> 02:10:45.571
AS A POINT OUT THE ANALYSIS.

02:10:45.637 --> 02:10:46.638
IS GOING TO BE A LOT OF HOMEWORK

02:10:46.705 --> 02:10:47.906

AGENCIES HERE TODAY

02:13:14.753 --> 02:13:17.022
UNFORTUNATELY IN OPPOSITION. TO

02:13:17.089 --> 02:13:19.091
SB THREE THIRTY TWO ALTHOUGH I

APPRECIATE THE ENTHUSIASM THAT

02:13:22.361 --> 02:13:24.029
THE SENATOR SHOWING FOR WATER

02:13:24.096 --> 02:13:26.098
POLICY TODAY -- I THINK IT'S

02:13:26.164 --> 02:13:27.966
IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT BEFORE I

02:13:28.033 --> 02:13:30.535
GET AT TO STARTED HERE THAT THE

02:13:30.602 --> 02:13:31.770
THE BILL WE'RE TALKING A LOT

02:13:31.837 --> 02:13:32.971
ABOUT GOALS UP HERE RIGHT NOW

02:13:33.038 --> 02:13:34.539
BUT THE BILL THAT WE'RE TALKING

02:13:34.606 --> 02:13:36.508
ABOUT TODAY IS A MANDATE SO.

02:13:36.575 --> 02:13:38.810
THIS IS A MANDATED REDUCTION ON

02:13:38.877 --> 02:13:41.113
ALL A WASTE WATER DISCHARGERS BY

02:13:41.179 --> 02:13:43.548
A 50% REDUCTION BY TWENTY THIRTY

02:13:43.615 --> 02:13:45.717
AND THEN A 95% REDUCTION.

02:13:45.784 --> 02:13:47.686
BY TWENTY FORTY SO -- YOU KNOW

02:13:47.753 --> 02:13:49.054
WE BELIEVE THAT THE BILLS WELL

02:13:49.121 --> 02:13:50.822
INTENDED BUT IN THE CURRENT FORM

02:13:50.889 --> 02:13:53.091
IS UNWORKABLE FOR MANY REASONS.

02:13:53.158 --> 02:13:54.359
THE VOLUME OF WATER WE'RE

02:13:54.426 --> 02:13:55.927
TALKING ABOUT IS IMMENSE THIS IS

02:13:55.994 --> 02:13:57.229
NOT A SCENARIO THAT WOULD ALLOW

02:13:57.295 --> 02:13:58.930
AGENCIES TO BUILD OUT A FEW MORE

02:13:58.997 --> 02:14:00.499
PURPLE PIPE SYSTEMS. FOR

02:14:00.565 --> 02:14:03.101
LANDSCAPE IRRIGATION OR YOU KNOW

02:14:03.168 --> 02:14:04.669
OTHER ALLOWABLE USES THE VOLUME

02:14:04.736 --> 02:14:05.971
OF WATER WOULD NECESSARILY

02:14:06.037 --> 02:14:08.173
REQUIRE LARGE SCALE RECYCLING.

02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:09.641
AND MOVING MASS QUANTITIES OF

02:14:09.708 --> 02:14:11.343
WATER TO STORAGE FOR RE USE SO

02:14:11.410 --> 02:14:13.011
SING EITHER A GROUNDWATER APPLE

02:14:13.078 --> 02:14:14.646
FOR A RESERVOIR PIPING IT

02:14:14.713 --> 02:14:17.315
DIRECTLY INTO A DRINKING WATER

02:14:17.382 --> 02:14:18.617
SYSTEM -- KEY COMPONENTS OF THE

02:14:18.683 --> 02:14:19.451
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR

02:14:19.518 --> 02:14:20.986
AGENCIES TO BE ABLE TO PURSUE

02:14:21.052 --> 02:14:22.053
THOSE TYPES OF STORAGE AND

02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:23.622
REDUCE OPTIONS ARE NOT YET IN

02:14:23.688 --> 02:14:25.490
PLACE AND THE WATER BOARD'S NOT

02:14:25.557 --> 02:14:26.858
REQUIRED TO DEVELOP.

02:14:26.925 --> 02:14:27.926
THE RAW WATER AUGMENTATION

02:14:27.993 --> 02:14:30.028
REGULATIONS UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY

02:14:30.095 --> 02:14:30.695
THREE AND AT THIS POINT THERE'S

02:14:30.762 --> 02:14:32.464
NO DEADLINE A REQUIREMENT FOR

02:14:32.531 --> 02:14:33.465
THEM TO DEVELOP THE TREATED

02:14:33.532 --> 02:14:35.133
DRINKING WATER AUGMENTATION RATE

02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:36.535
REGULATIONS.

02:14:36.601 --> 02:14:38.103
CALIFORNIA WATER AND WASTEWATER

02:14:38.170 --> 02:14:39.604
AGENCIES ARE THE FOR FUN OF

02:14:39.671 --> 02:14:41.373
WATER RECYCLING ON THE WORLD

02:14:41.440 --> 02:14:43.175
WIDE SCALE AND MANY OF OUR

02:14:43.241 --> 02:14:44.910
MEMBER AGENCIES ARE VOLUNTARILY

02:14:44.976 --> 02:14:46.478
DOING SOME OF THE MOST.

02:14:46.545 --> 02:14:47.746
PROGRESSIVE AN AMBITIOUS

02:14:47.813 --> 02:14:49.581
PROJECTS AND THE COUNTRY AND

02:14:49.648 --> 02:14:51.049
JUST TO PUT THIS PROPOSAL

02:14:51.116 --> 02:14:52.451
PROPOSAL IN PERSPECTIVE FOR A

02:14:52.517 --> 02:14:53.285
MOMENT.

02:14:53.351 --> 02:14:54.419
NONE OF THE PROJECT UNDER WAY IN

02:14:54.486 --> 02:14:56.054
CALIFORNIA WHEN AT THEIR FULL

02:14:56.121 --> 02:14:57.989
OPERATIONAL CAPACITY -- WOULD BE

02:14:58.056 --> 02:15:00.058
ABLE TO MEET THE MANDATED

02:15:00.125 --> 02:15:01.827
REDUCTION SET FORTH IN THIS BILL.

02:15:01.893 --> 02:15:02.994
I'D ALSO POINT OUT THAT MANY OF

02:15:03.061 --> 02:15:04.830
THESE BIG PROJECTS AROUND TWENTY

02:15:04.896 --> 02:15:05.997
TO THIRTY YEAR PROJECT SCHEDULES

02:15:06.064 --> 02:15:07.365
AND WOULDN'T RECEIVE ANY CREDIT

02:15:07.432 --> 02:15:08.200
FOR THE PROGRESS THAT THEY'VE

02:15:08.266 --> 02:15:09.935
ALREADY MADE BOTH FOR

02:15:10.001 --> 02:15:12.170
CONSERVATION AND FOR RECYCLING.

02:15:12.237 --> 02:15:13.338
THERE ARE VAST REGIONAL

02:15:13.405 --> 02:15:15.040
VARIATIONS AND HOW WATER IS

02:15:15.106 --> 02:15:16.408
MANAGED IN CALIFORNIA AND THE

02:15:16.475 --> 02:15:18.009
BILL MAKES NO CONCESSIONS FOR

02:15:18.076 --> 02:15:19.744
AGENCIES THAT HAVE LEGITIMATE

02:15:19.811 --> 02:15:21.580
LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES. FOR RE

02:15:21.646 --> 02:15:23.181
USING THIS VOLUME OF WATER IN

02:15:23.248 --> 02:15:24.783
SOME PLACES THERE JUST IS NOT A

02:15:24.850 --> 02:15:26.518
STORAGE OPTION AND THE MANDATE

02:15:26.585 --> 02:15:27.586
WOULD MEAN.

02:15:27.652 --> 02:15:29.187
MOVING LARGE QUANTITIES OF WATER

02:15:29.254 --> 02:15:30.188
FOR EXAMPLE OVER A MOUNTAIN

02:15:30.255 --> 02:15:32.657
RANGE TO SECURE ADEQUATE STORAGE

02:15:32.724 --> 02:15:34.693
THE GHG IMPACTS AND ENERGY

02:15:34.759 --> 02:15:35.327
DEMANDS FOR LARGE SCALE

02:15:35.393 --> 02:15:36.495
TREATMENT.

02:15:36.561 --> 02:15:38.730
AND TRANSPORT OF A WATER PROJECT

02:15:38.797 --> 02:15:40.899
LIKE THAT ARE CONSIDERABLE --

02:15:40.966 --> 02:15:42.300
WASTEWATER DISCHARGES ARE ALSO

02:15:42.367 --> 02:15:43.969
NECESSARY FOR BRIAN MANAGEMENT

02:15:44.035 --> 02:15:45.403
IN CALIFORNIA AND A CERTAIN

02:15:45.470 --> 02:15:46.771
VOLUME OF AFFLUENT LEVEL OF

02:15:46.838 --> 02:15:48.406
DILUTION IS REQUIRED BY THE

02:15:48.473 --> 02:15:50.208
WATER BOARD AN EPA. TO MANAGE

02:15:50.275 --> 02:15:51.309
THAT WASTE BYPRODUCT OF THE

02:15:51.376 --> 02:15:52.878
TREATMENT PROCESS AND IN MANY

02:15:52.944 --> 02:15:54.646
PLACES ESPECIALLY WIRE REGION'S

02:15:54.713 --> 02:15:56.147
THERE SIMPLY ISN'T THE DEMAND OR

02:15:56.214 --> 02:15:57.682
MARKET FOR THIS MUCH ADDITIONAL

02:15:57.749 --> 02:15:58.383
WATER.

02:15:58.450 --> 02:16:00.285
PARTICULARLY DURING THE RAINY

02:16:00.352 --> 02:16:01.086
SEASON.

02:16:01.152 --> 02:16:02.754
THESE ARE JUST A SMALL SUBSET OF

02:16:02.821 --> 02:16:04.556
TECHNICAL ISSUES RAISED BY OUR

02:16:04.623 --> 02:16:05.857
MEMBER AGENCIES AND THERE ARE

02:16:05.924 --> 02:16:08.460
MANY MORE THAT VERY BY AGENCY

02:16:08.527 --> 02:16:10.295
AND BY REGION -- FINALLY WHAT

02:16:10.362 --> 02:16:11.730
THE TECHNICAL ISSUES ASIDE I

02:16:11.796 --> 02:16:12.731
WANT TO BRING UP THE ISSUE OF

02:16:12.797 --> 02:16:14.666
COST AND AFFORDABILITY OF WATER

02:16:14.733 --> 02:16:16.067
SERVICE IN CALIFORNIA.

02:16:16.134 --> 02:16:17.602
OUR AGENCIES ARE ESTIMATING THAT

02:16:17.669 --> 02:16:19.104
THIS BILL WOULD RESULT IN MULTI

02:16:19.170 --> 02:16:20.572
BILLION DOLLAR INFRASTRUCTURE

02:16:20.639 --> 02:16:22.407
NEEDS ON AN AGENCY BY AGENCY

02:16:22.474 --> 02:16:23.775
BASIS.

02:16:23.842 --> 02:16:24.876
THE RESULTING RATE IMPACTS WOULD

02:16:24.943 --> 02:16:27.045
BE STAGGERING AGENCIES ARE

02:16:27.112 --> 02:16:28.280
TELLING US THEY BE LOOKING AT

02:16:28.346 --> 02:16:29.948
RATE INCREASES OF SEVERAL

02:16:30.015 --> 02:16:31.483
HUNDRED DOLLARS PER HOUSEHOLD.

02:16:31.550 --> 02:16:32.183
AND BECAUSE WE'RE

02:16:32.250 --> 02:16:33.218
CONSTITUTIONALLY REQUIRED TO

02:16:33.285 --> 02:16:34.352
ASSESS PROPORTIONAL UNFAIR FEES

02:16:34.419 --> 02:16:37.188
THOSE IMPACTS R. COSTA SYSTEM.

02:16:37.255 --> 02:16:38.323
AND INCLUDE ALL IMPACTED RATE

02:16:38.390 --> 02:16:39.791
PAYERS INCLUDING BUSINESSES AND

02:16:39.858 --> 02:16:41.293
DUSTY ON COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS

02:16:41.359 --> 02:16:43.595
AND INCLUDING EVEN DISADVANTAGED

02:16:43.662 --> 02:16:44.596
COMMUNITIES.

02:16:44.663 --> 02:16:45.931
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE

02:16:45.997 --> 02:16:47.632
THAT WE DON'T IS TO DISAGREE

02:16:47.699 --> 02:16:48.767
WITH THE INTENT OF THE BILL

02:16:48.833 --> 02:16:50.468
WHICH IS I THINK TO FIND A WAY

02:16:50.535 --> 02:16:51.937
TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS OVER

02:16:52.003 --> 02:16:54.306
USE OF WATER IN CALIFORNIA.

02:16:54.372 --> 02:16:55.740
UNFORTUNATELY THE WAY THE BILL

02:16:55.807 --> 02:16:57.342
PROPOSES ACHIEVING THAT ANGLE IS

02:16:57.409 --> 02:16:58.443
PUNITIVE AND IT DOESN'T

02:16:58.510 --> 02:16:59.945
RECOGNIZE THE TECHNICAL

02:17:00.011 --> 02:17:01.413
REALITIES AND REGIONAL

02:17:01.479 --> 02:17:03.148
DIFFERENCES IN WATER MANAGEMENT.

02:17:03.214 --> 02:17:03.915
WE APPRECIATE THE TEARING

AND ALSO THE RECOMMENDATION AND

02:17:08.186 --> 02:17:09.888
THE ANALYSIS.

02:17:09.955 --> 02:17:11.122
TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION A

02:17:11.189 --> 02:17:12.958
STAKEHOLDER PROCESS -- MOVING

02:17:13.024 --> 02:17:15.126
FORWARD WE THINK IT'S NECESSARY

02:17:15.193 --> 02:17:16.861
TO RE FRAME THIS LEGISLATION TO

02:17:16.928 --> 02:17:18.430
MOVE AWAY FROM SETTING MANDATED

02:17:18.496 --> 02:17:19.764
REDUCTIONS ON WASTEWATER

02:17:19.831 --> 02:17:21.566
DISCHARGES AND INSTEAD SHIFTING

02:17:21.633 --> 02:17:23.001
THE FOCUS TO MAXIMIZING

02:17:23.068 --> 02:17:24.502
BENEFICIAL REUSE.

02:17:24.569 --> 02:17:26.171
BY ADDRESSING EXISTING BARRIERS

02:17:26.237 --> 02:17:27.906
TO ACHIEVING THAT ANGLE SO FOR

02:17:27.973 --> 02:17:29.107
THESE REASONS WERE OPPOSED AND

02:17:29.174 --> 02:17:30.208
WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING

FINDING A RESOLUTION FOR OUR

02:17:35.880 --> 02:17:37.215
CONCERNS [inaudible]

02:17:37.282 --> 02:17:38.450

02:17:41.152 --> 02:17:42.621
ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA WATER

02:17:42.687 --> 02:17:44.589
AGENCIES RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO

02:17:44.656 --> 02:17:46.157
THE BILL ALTHOUGH WE DON'T THINK

02:17:46.224 --> 02:17:48.827
IT'S SWISS CHEESE NECESSARILY --

02:17:48.893 --> 02:17:50.395
WE REPRESENT OVER FOUR HUNDRED

02:17:50.462 --> 02:17:51.696
FIFTY PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES MANY

02:17:51.763 --> 02:17:52.998
OF WHICH HAVE ALREADY MADE

02:17:53.064 --> 02:17:55.300
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS -- ON ON

02:17:55.367 --> 02:17:56.468
PORTABLE AND NON POTABLE REUSE

02:17:56.534 --> 02:17:58.536
PROJECTS SO TO BE CLEAR WE ARE

02:17:58.603 --> 02:18:00.238
SUPPORTIVE OF INCENTIVIZING THE

02:18:00.305 --> 02:18:03.608
BENEFICIAL USE OF RECYCLED WATER --

02:18:03.675 --> 02:18:06.111
WHERE WE OPPOSED TO SB -- THREE

02:18:06.177 --> 02:18:06.745
THREE TWO IS DUE TO THE IMMENSE

02:18:06.811 --> 02:18:08.680
COMPLIANCE CHALLENGES IT WOULD

02:18:08.747 --> 02:18:10.382
CREATE FOR WATER SYSTEMS.

02:18:10.448 --> 02:18:11.716
THESE CHALLENGES INCLUDE COST A

02:18:11.783 --> 02:18:12.784
LACK OF AN APPROPRIATE

02:18:12.851 --> 02:18:13.985
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK TECHNICAL

02:18:14.052 --> 02:18:16.154
FEASIBILITY AND A LACK OF

02:18:16.221 --> 02:18:17.288
FLEXIBILITY.

02:18:17.355 --> 02:18:18.623
AS MS GOVERNOR POINTED OUT THE

02:18:18.690 --> 02:18:19.991
CAPITAL INVESTMENTS THAT WOULD

02:18:20.058 --> 02:18:21.693
BE REQUIRED BY THE BILL WOULD BE

02:18:21.760 --> 02:18:23.828
STAGGERING -- IN ORDER FOR WATER

02:18:23.895 --> 02:18:25.563
AGENCIES TO REDUCE DISCHARGES BY

02:18:25.630 --> 02:18:27.966
SUCH A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE IN

02:18:28.033 --> 02:18:29.334
ALMOST EVERY INSTANCE IT WOULD

02:18:29.401 --> 02:18:30.669
REQUIRE THE CONSTRUCTION OF

02:18:30.735 --> 02:18:32.337
LARGE SCALE TREATMENT FACILITIES

02:18:32.404 --> 02:18:33.872
CONVEYANCE INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:18:33.938 --> 02:18:35.674
THIS BAND POTENTIALLY -- MANY

02:18:35.740 --> 02:18:38.176
MILES AND COULD TAKE DECADES TO

02:18:38.243 --> 02:18:39.444
COMPLETE.

02:18:39.511 --> 02:18:40.779
ARE THESE SIGNIFICANT COSTS

02:18:40.845 --> 02:18:41.346
WOULD HAVE TO BE SPREAD TO

02:18:41.413 --> 02:18:43.648
EXISTING RATE PAYERS PURSUANT TO

02:18:43.715 --> 02:18:45.316
PROP TO EIGHTEEN AS WE ARE LOCAL

02:18:45.383 --> 02:18:46.484
GOVERNMENTS.

02:18:46.551 --> 02:18:47.552
AND THIS WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY

02:18:47.619 --> 02:18:49.721
IMPACT THE AFFORDABILITY OF

02:18:49.788 --> 02:18:50.855
WATER AS MISS GOVERNOR POINTED

02:18:50.922 --> 02:18:52.924
OUT WHICH AFFORDABILITY WATER WE

02:18:52.991 --> 02:18:54.959
KNOW IS A GREAT CONCERN OF OF

02:18:55.026 --> 02:18:57.796
THIS BODY -- IN ADDITION IN

02:18:57.862 --> 02:18:58.563
ORDER TO MEET THE DISCHARGE

02:18:58.630 --> 02:18:59.864
REDUCTION GOALS PROPOSED BY THIS

02:18:59.931 --> 02:19:01.032
BILL WATER PROVIDERS WOULD

02:19:01.099 --> 02:19:02.233
ALMOST CERTAINLY HAVE TO DEVELOP

02:19:02.300 --> 02:19:04.102
LARGE SCALE REVIEWS OF POTABLE

02:19:04.169 --> 02:19:05.537
REDUCE PROJECTS.

02:19:05.603 --> 02:19:07.272
SOME WATER PROVIDERS -- HAVE

02:19:07.338 --> 02:19:08.873
ALREADY TAKEN -- SIGNIFICANT

02:19:08.940 --> 02:19:10.408
PROJECTS THAT FOR NON POTABLE

02:19:10.475 --> 02:19:12.944
WATER -- AND SO THEY'RE REALLY

02:19:13.011 --> 02:19:14.879
LEFT TRYING TO MEET THIS GOAL

02:19:14.946 --> 02:19:17.549
I'M USING -- POSSIBLE SOURCES

02:19:17.615 --> 02:19:18.583
WERE CREATING PORTABLE SOURCES

02:19:18.650 --> 02:19:21.453
SO IN IN ORDER TO MEET THE

02:19:21.519 --> 02:19:22.854
MANDATE -- BECAUSE BY THIS THIS

02:19:22.921 --> 02:19:24.556
BILL WATER PROVIDERS WOULD

02:19:24.622 --> 02:19:26.057
CERTAINLY HAVE TO LOOK TOWARDS --

02:19:26.124 --> 02:19:27.525
NEW PORTABLE RE USE PROJECTS

02:19:27.592 --> 02:19:30.228
THAT ARE ARE VERY COMPLICATED --

02:19:30.295 --> 02:19:31.930
TECHNICALLY VERY DIFFICULT AND

02:19:31.996 --> 02:19:34.966
COSTLY TO IMPLEMENT -- IN AGAIN

02:19:35.033 --> 02:19:35.967
AS MISS GALLAGHER STATED THE

02:19:36.034 --> 02:19:37.235
STATE WATER BOARD WILL NOT ADOPT

02:19:37.302 --> 02:19:38.770
REGULATIONS REGARDING WHAT DRAW

02:19:38.837 --> 02:19:41.506
WATER AUGMENTATION UNTIL.

02:19:41.573 --> 02:19:42.440
TWENTY TWENTY THREE A YEAR AFTER

02:19:42.507 --> 02:19:43.942
THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE AGENCIES

02:19:44.008 --> 02:19:45.009
TO IDENTIFY HOW THEY'RE GOING TO

02:19:45.076 --> 02:19:47.879
COMPLY -- AND THEN FINALLY

02:19:47.946 --> 02:19:50.014
FLEXIBILITY THIS BILL REALLY

02:19:50.081 --> 02:19:52.650
DOESN'T ALLOW FOR FLEXIBILITY --

02:19:52.717 --> 02:19:54.018
FOR WATER AGENCIES TO PROPERLY

02:19:54.085 --> 02:19:57.722
MANAGE THEIR SYSTEMS -- AS YOU

02:19:57.789 --> 02:19:59.057
ALL KNOW EACH COMMUNITY IS

02:19:59.124 --> 02:20:00.358
DIFFERENT HAS DIFFERENT WATER

02:20:00.425 --> 02:20:01.726
RESOURCES AND NEEDS AND THIS

02:20:01.793 --> 02:20:02.827
BILL WOULD EFFECTIVELY

02:20:02.894 --> 02:20:04.529
PRIORITIZE WATER REUSE PRODUCE

02:20:04.596 --> 02:20:05.463
PROJECTS.

02:20:05.530 --> 02:20:06.865
OVER OUR OTHER PROJECTS THAT

02:20:06.931 --> 02:20:08.099
BENEFIT THE REGION SUCH AS

02:20:08.166 --> 02:20:10.568

FIRST WATER STORAGE --

02:20:12.170 --> 02:20:14.372
HYDROELECTRIC PROJECTS -- SO THE

02:20:14.439 --> 02:20:15.840
BILL DOESN'T REALLY CONSIDER YOU

02:20:15.907 --> 02:20:17.275
KNOW EACH REGION INDEPENDENTLY

02:20:17.342 --> 02:20:19.544

WATER PROJECTS BUT IN A MANNER

02:20:25.350 --> 02:20:27.485
THAT -- LOOKS AT MORE REGIONAL

02:20:27.552 --> 02:20:30.188
BASIS AND CONSIDERS THE NEEDS OF

02:20:30.255 --> 02:20:31.222
EACH COMMUNITY.

I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE

02:26:37.688 --> 02:26:38.656
DEALING WITH IT BUT THE ONLY

AMOUNT OF WATER THAT YOU'RE

02:26:50.301 --> 02:26:50.968
TALKING ABOUT A GOES THE OCEAN

ELSE'S DISTRICT WHAT'S THE

02:26:55.239 --> 02:26:56.574
IMPACT THERE'S A BUNCH OF

02:26:56.641 --> 02:26:58.409
STAKEHOLDERS LEARN HERE LIKE

02:26:58.476 --> 02:26:59.010
LET'S THINK ABOUT THE

02:26:59.076 --> 02:26:59.977
ENVIRONMENT.

02:27:00.044 --> 02:27:01.546
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT IN THE

02:27:01.612 --> 02:27:03.147
WE HAD WE HAVE ALL THESE ISSUES

02:27:03.214 --> 02:27:04.348
OFTEN AND HE ARCHES OF

02:27:04.415 --> 02:27:07.885
ENVIRONMENTAL WATER WE ALSO HAVE

02:27:07.952 --> 02:27:09.587
IN TERMS OF THE THE BECAUSE THIS

02:27:09.654 --> 02:27:11.656
IS BIG PUZZLE WERE ALL KIND OF

02:27:11.722 --> 02:27:12.890
FITS TOGETHER BUT BE BE WITH

02:27:12.957 --> 02:27:14.225
WITH JUST I GET THE DIFFERENCES

02:27:14.292 --> 02:27:14.425
WAS?

02:27:14.492 --> 02:27:15.326
BACK LIKE YOU KNOW IF THAT IF

02:27:15.393 --> 02:27:16.861
THAT'S IF THAT'S A CONCERN THEN

02:27:16.928 --> 02:27:17.662
SHOULD WE HAVE A DIFFERENT

02:27:17.728 --> 02:27:19.597
APPROACH TO THOSE AREAS THAT ARE

02:27:19.664 --> 02:27:20.865
IMPORTING ALL THAT WATER FROM

02:27:20.932 --> 02:27:23.534
OTHER PARTS THE STATE -- WOULD

02:27:23.601 --> 02:27:25.803
THAT BE AS OPPOSED TO HAVING THE

02:27:25.870 --> 02:27:26.103
SAME.

02:27:26.170 --> 02:27:27.138
I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER THAT

02:27:27.205 --> 02:27:28.339
QUESTION BUT I DO THINK IT

02:27:28.406 --> 02:27:29.874
MERITS MERIT SOME SOME SOME

02:27:29.941 --> 02:27:30.908
HOMEWORK MIGHT MIGHT PLAY A

02:27:30.975 --> 02:27:32.410
BIGGER PART ABOUT THIS IS IS

02:27:32.476 --> 02:27:33.744
THAT WE TALK ABOUT THIS THAT THE

02:27:33.811 --> 02:27:35.112
NATURE OF THIS PARTICULARLY IN

02:27:35.179 --> 02:27:36.714
HOW MUCH WATER IS WHEELED FROM

02:27:36.781 --> 02:27:38.149
ALL OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE.

02:27:38.216 --> 02:27:42.220
WHAT YOU'RE MISSING WITH EVERY

02:27:42.286 --> 02:27:43.721
IS MISSING IN THE EQUATION THIS?

02:27:43.788 --> 02:27:44.722
YOU KEEP WILLING THAT WATER

02:27:44.789 --> 02:27:45.556
LEVEL AT ALL AS AN ACRE FOOT FOR

02:27:45.623 --> 02:27:46.991
METROPOLITAN WATER LA STEAL IT

02:27:47.058 --> 02:27:48.492
FROM THE COLOR RIVER WELL IF YOU

02:27:48.559 --> 02:27:49.994
CAN RECYCLE WATER THAT ELEVEN

02:27:50.061 --> 02:27:50.962
DOLLARS AN ACRE FOOT THAT WATERS

02:27:51.028 --> 02:27:52.196
RESOLD.

02:27:52.263 --> 02:27:52.997
IS THAT THERE IS A LOT OF

02:27:53.064 --> 02:27:54.265
DIAGNOSTIC IN THAT I DON'T

02:27:54.332 --> 02:27:55.866
DISAGREE WITH YOU IN THAT

02:27:55.933 --> 02:27:56.968
THOUGHT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK

02:27:57.034 --> 02:27:59.103
WITH PEOPLE I WAS IS SUGGEST IN

02:27:59.170 --> 02:28:00.605
THE ANALYSIS TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

02:28:00.671 --> 02:28:01.939
BUT YOU KNOW I GOTTA TELL YOU

02:28:02.006 --> 02:28:03.541
THIS IS LIKE DEJA VU ALL OVER

02:28:03.608 --> 02:28:05.810
AGAIN THE SKY IS FALLING NOTHING

02:28:05.876 --> 02:28:07.612
WILL EVER BE MET THE ALL THE

02:28:07.678 --> 02:28:09.213
IMPOSSIBLE STANDARDS OF WHY YOU

02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:10.982
CAN'T DO SOMETHING AND WE HAD

02:28:11.048 --> 02:28:12.116
20% OUR PS.

02:28:12.183 --> 02:28:13.517
AND THEN BEFORE THE DEADLINE

02:28:13.584 --> 02:28:14.785
EVERYBODY WAS BRIGHT AND HOW

02:28:14.852 --> 02:28:16.087
THEY EXCEEDED THEIR NUMBERS

02:28:16.153 --> 02:28:17.855
RIGHT YES THERE'S DIFFERENCES

02:28:17.922 --> 02:28:19.290
YESTERDAY AFFLUENT NUMBERS THAT

02:28:19.357 --> 02:28:20.224
YOU NEED TO HAVE.

02:28:20.291 --> 02:28:24.562
AND HOW MUCH IS IT'S A 20% BOGEY

02:28:24.629 --> 02:28:25.963
RIGHT SO.

02:28:26.030 --> 02:28:26.764
I UNDERSTAND AND I DO THINK IT

02:28:26.831 --> 02:28:27.932
NEEDS TO BE A MANDATE -- IN

02:28:27.999 --> 02:28:29.834
WHATEVER IT IS WHAT WITH THE WE

02:28:29.900 --> 02:28:31.068
LOOK AT DIFFERENT FACTORS YOU

02:28:31.135 --> 02:28:32.436
COULD PATIENTS AT THIS IS SECOND

02:28:32.503 --> 02:28:33.871
IN TERMS THE LARGER ISSUE.

02:28:33.938 --> 02:28:35.706
BUT I THINK THAT YOU WOULD WERE

02:28:35.773 --> 02:28:37.141
NOT LOOKING AT THE THE LARGER

02:28:37.208 --> 02:28:39.510
KIND OF SUSTAINABLE APPROACH

02:28:39.577 --> 02:28:40.878
THAT WE NEED TO DEAL WITH.

02:28:40.945 --> 02:28:43.414
ARE A IN WATER POLICY AND MAYBE

02:28:43.481 --> 02:28:44.682
THERE WILL BE SOME DIFFERENCES

02:28:44.749 --> 02:28:45.750
AND IT WAS VERY SIGNIFICANT

02:28:45.816 --> 02:28:47.184
DIFFERENCES NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

02:28:47.251 --> 02:28:48.552
I AGREE I DON'T DISAGREE WITH

02:28:48.619 --> 02:28:48.753
WHAT.

02:28:48.819 --> 02:28:49.720
THE POINTS THAT WERE MADE ABOUT

02:28:49.787 --> 02:28:51.289
SAN FRANCISCO IN THE FACT THAT A

02:28:51.355 --> 02:28:52.290
LOT OF PEOPLE ORANGE COUNTY'S

02:28:52.356 --> 02:28:53.491
THE PLATINUM.

02:28:53.557 --> 02:28:55.893
STANDARD IN TERMS OF RECYCLING

02:28:55.960 --> 02:28:56.460
HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND ACRE

02:28:56.527 --> 02:28:57.261
FEET NOW THE RATS PRETTY

02:28:57.328 --> 02:28:58.696
INCREDIBLE.

02:28:58.763 --> 02:29:00.965
BUT BUT HAT BEING SAID -- I

02:29:01.032 --> 02:29:01.899
THINK WE'RE GETTING EVERYBODY'S

02:29:01.966 --> 02:29:03.534
ATTENTION IN THIS HERTZBERG AN

02:29:03.601 --> 02:29:05.569
APPROACH TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT

02:29:05.636 --> 02:29:07.104
HOW TO SET THOSE STANDARDS IN A

02:29:07.171 --> 02:29:08.606
WAY THAT THAT IT WORKS.

02:29:08.673 --> 02:29:10.474
AND THE IS RESPECTABLE TO

02:29:10.541 --> 02:29:11.709
REGIONAL DIFFERENCES AND HAS THE

02:29:11.776 --> 02:29:13.778
NECESSARY FLEXIBILITY WITHIN THE

02:29:13.844 --> 02:29:16.514
FRAMEWORK OUT OF TREES YOU WOULD

02:29:16.580 --> 02:29:17.948
HAVE SOMETHING. TO THIS.

02:29:18.015 --> 02:29:19.250
I I WOULD JUST SAY THAT YEAH YOU

02:29:19.317 --> 02:29:19.750
KNOW WE AT THE REGIONAL

02:29:19.817 --> 02:29:20.918
DIFFERENCES IS AN AREA WHERE WE

02:29:20.985 --> 02:29:22.086
ARE LOOKING TO HAVE ADDITIONAL

02:29:22.153 --> 02:29:23.220
CONVERSATIONS.

02:29:23.287 --> 02:29:24.889
I THINK WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT

02:29:24.955 --> 02:29:25.956
YOU KNOW ANYTIME THAT YOU'RE

02:29:26.023 --> 02:29:27.124
REMOVING WATER FROM THE

02:29:27.191 --> 02:29:29.193
ENVIRONMENT -- YOU KNOW IN SAN

02:29:29.260 --> 02:29:29.994

WITH THE AT TAMI THERE YOU KNOW

02:29:31.696 --> 02:29:32.763
WANTING MORE MORE WATER FROM

THAT AND I THINK THAT -- YOU

02:29:34.565 --> 02:29:35.232

02:29:35.299 --> 02:29:36.500
HAVE THOSE ISSUES AND WE JUST

02:29:36.567 --> 02:29:37.034
WANT TO LOOK A LITTLE BIT

02:29:37.101 --> 02:29:38.803
FURTHER INTO THEM -- OBVIOUSLY

02:29:38.869 --> 02:29:40.304
IMPORTED WATER IS A MORE OBVIOUS

02:29:40.371 --> 02:29:42.273
CASE WHERE RECYCLED WATER AND

02:29:42.340 --> 02:29:44.275
IMPORTED OR COST COMPETITIVE AND

02:29:44.342 --> 02:29:46.944
YOU KNOW -- AND RECYCLE WATER

02:29:47.011 --> 02:29:48.346
HAS THE ADDED BENEFIT OF LOWER

02:29:48.412 --> 02:29:50.548
LIABILITY AND NO BUT IF DROUGHT

02:29:50.614 --> 02:29:53.584
PROOF -- QUALITY SO -- YOU KNOW

I WOULD SAY THAT I MEAN WE'RE

02:29:54.585 --> 02:29:56.654
EXPLORING THOSE AND AND LOOK FOR

02:29:56.721 --> 02:29:57.321
TO CONTINUE WORKING ON IT.

02:29:57.388 --> 02:29:58.622

02:34:40.537 --> 02:34:41.872
CHALLENGES AS WE SHOULD CENTER

02:34:41.939 --> 02:34:43.374
HILL RAISED ON TIMING AND THINGS

02:34:43.440 --> 02:34:43.974
LIKE THAT.

02:34:44.041 --> 02:34:46.577
BUT THE COST THING IS TO ME IS

02:34:46.644 --> 02:34:48.879
NOT A GIGANTIC PROB PROBLEM IT

02:34:48.946 --> 02:34:50.180
BOTH IN THE RESPECT THAT THERE'S

02:34:50.247 --> 02:34:51.415
A REVENUE STREAM NUMBER.

02:34:51.482 --> 02:34:52.850
ONE AND TWO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

02:34:52.916 --> 02:34:53.984
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHEN YOU

02:34:54.051 --> 02:34:55.586
WORK ON THESE BIG PUBLIC WORKS

02:34:55.653 --> 02:34:57.888
PROJECTS -- ABOUT SEVENTY FOUR

02:34:57.955 --> 02:34:58.856
CENTS OF EVERY DOLLAR COMES BACK

02:34:58.922 --> 02:35:01.125
IN THE FORM PAYROLL TAXES SALES

02:35:01.191 --> 02:35:03.327
TAX AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS SO.

02:35:03.394 --> 02:35:04.395
WHEN YOU REALLY LOOK AT THESE

02:35:04.461 --> 02:35:05.763
BIG CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS THAT

02:35:05.829 --> 02:35:07.297
ARE NECESSARY? FOR

02:35:07.364 --> 02:35:09.266
INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE IMPACT ON

02:35:09.333 --> 02:35:10.834
THE ACTUAL GOVERNMENT IS IS

02:35:10.901 --> 02:35:12.770
REALLY MINIMAL NUMBER ONE AND

02:35:12.836 --> 02:35:14.104
TWO IF WE DON'T PASS.

02:35:14.171 --> 02:35:15.606
THE TAX REFORM WE HAVE MORE

02:35:15.673 --> 02:35:17.374
VOLATILITY GOING FORWARD AND

02:35:17.441 --> 02:35:18.575
DURING THE DOWN TERMS OF

02:35:18.642 --> 02:35:20.444
VOLATILITY LIKE WHAT WE DID WITH

02:35:20.511 --> 02:35:21.779
OUR BIG GIGANTIC HAIRY AUDACIOUS

02:35:21.845 --> 02:35:24.148
IDEA ON SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION.

02:35:24.214 --> 02:35:25.249
DOES CONSTRUCTION JOBS HAD A

02:35:25.315 --> 02:35:27.217
GIGANTIC IMPACT IN MITIGATING

02:35:27.284 --> 02:35:28.786
SOME OF THE DOWNTURN IN THE

02:35:28.852 --> 02:35:30.454
ECONOMY SO THESE STEPS WHEN YOU

02:35:30.521 --> 02:35:31.889
DO THE DIAGNOSTIC IN THE LARGER

02:35:31.955 --> 02:35:33.524

FORWARD DEALING THE ANALYSIS IS

02:35:40.931 --> 02:35:41.865
ONE OF THE SMALLEST AREAS THAT

02:35:41.932 --> 02:35:43.167
WE HAVE CHALLENGES ARE IF WE

02:35:43.233 --> 02:35:44.768

THAT THE SENATOR READ AT THE

HOUSING UNITS IN THE NEXT TEN

02:51:57.573 --> 02:51:59.409

REDUCTIONS WOULD BE THERE THAT'S

02:53:58.628 --> 02:54:00.196

02:55:03.359 --> 02:55:04.293
PLANNING.

02:55:04.360 --> 02:55:05.294
BUT WE DO TRANSPORTATION

02:55:05.361 --> 02:55:07.530
AGENCIES HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO

02:55:07.597 --> 02:55:08.898
CONTROL.

02:55:08.965 --> 02:55:11.067
OVER LAND USE DECISIONS ANY MORE

02:55:11.133 --> 02:55:12.501

02:55:18.007 --> 02:55:19.542
BUT WE AS A TRANSPORTATION

02:55:19.609 --> 02:55:21.310
AGENCIES HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY

02:55:21.377 --> 02:55:23.512

TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS WHICH WE

02:55:29.886 --> 02:55:31.254
THINK WE DO A REALLY GOOD JOB OF

02:55:31.320 --> 02:55:32.989
BUT WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE LAND

02:55:33.055 --> 02:55:34.323
USE PLANNING AND SO THE TEETH AT

02:55:34.390 --> 02:55:35.124
THIS.

02:55:35.191 --> 02:55:38.461
BILL -- INCLUDES IS ARE ENTIRELY

02:55:38.527 --> 02:55:39.996
DIRECTED AT TRANSPORTATION

02:55:40.062 --> 02:55:41.931
AGENCIES THAT HAVE NO CONTROL

02:55:41.998 --> 02:55:44.367
OVER A LAND USE DECISIONS.

02:55:44.433 --> 02:55:46.135
AND THEN SECONDLY -- IN A MORE

02:55:46.202 --> 02:55:48.204
TECHNICAL WAY -- I'D LIKE TO

02:55:48.271 --> 02:55:50.539
JUST RAISE THE ISSUE OF V. M. T. --

02:55:50.606 --> 02:55:52.074
WE DON'T THINK IT'S A GREAT

02:55:52.141 --> 02:55:55.177
BAROMETER OF GHG REDUCTIONS --

02:55:55.244 --> 02:55:57.246
FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE VERY PROUD OF

02:55:57.313 --> 02:55:59.015
A PROJECT IN AN ORANGE COUNTY

02:55:59.081 --> 02:56:00.783
CALLED THE OC STREET CARTS JUST

02:56:00.850 --> 02:56:02.518
GETTING OFF THE GROUND AS WELL

02:56:02.585 --> 02:56:03.786
JUST IN TERMS OF CONSTRUCTION.

02:56:03.853 --> 02:56:06.088
IT IS A BRAND NEW TRANSIT SYSTEM

02:56:06.155 --> 02:56:07.456
NOBODY ELSE IS BUILDING TRENT

02:56:07.523 --> 02:56:08.391
NEW TRANSIT SYSTEMS THIS IS AN

02:56:08.457 --> 02:56:09.959
EXPANSION ONE THIS IS A BRAND

02:56:10.026 --> 02:56:11.460
NEW ONE IN ORANGE COUNTY TO

02:56:11.527 --> 02:56:13.262
SERVE. ONE OF THE DENSEST AREAS

02:56:13.329 --> 02:56:15.097
OF I'M NOT ONLY ORANGE COUNTY

02:56:15.164 --> 02:56:16.599
BUT THE NATION AND SANTA ANA

02:56:16.666 --> 02:56:17.867
WE'RE INCREDIBLY PROUD OF IT

02:56:17.934 --> 02:56:19.568
WE'VE COBBLE TOGETHER FUNDS

02:56:19.635 --> 02:56:21.304
THROUGHOUT -- LOCAL MEASURE

02:56:21.370 --> 02:56:23.839
MONEY STATE DOLLARS AND FEDERAL

02:56:23.906 --> 02:56:24.874
DOLLARS.

02:56:24.941 --> 02:56:27.576
BUT THIS PROJECT IRONICALLY AT

02:56:27.643 --> 02:56:29.011
LEAST IN TERMS OF THE NARROW

02:56:29.078 --> 02:56:30.980
DEFINITION OF THE M. T. FROM ANY

02:56:31.047 --> 02:56:32.214
AYE OUR PERSPECTIVE.

02:56:32.281 --> 02:56:37.186
INCREASES -- VMT.

02:56:37.253 --> 02:56:37.987
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO RE ROUTE

02:56:38.054 --> 02:56:39.789
TRAFFIC WE HAVE AN WE HAVE A

02:56:39.855 --> 02:56:41.324
COMMUTERS THAT -- GO TO THE END

02:56:41.390 --> 02:56:43.359
POINTS AND SO ON A VERY NARROW

02:56:43.426 --> 02:56:44.894
DEFINITION IT DOES INCREASE THE

02:56:44.961 --> 02:56:46.862
M. T. BUT IT ABSOLUTELY REDUCES

02:56:46.929 --> 02:56:48.564
GHG AND AND I THINK IT'S THE

02:56:48.631 --> 02:56:51.033
EXACT PROJECT TYPE OF PROJECT --

02:56:51.100 --> 02:56:55.104
THAT THIS BODY HAS TALKED ABOUT --

02:56:55.171 --> 02:56:56.238
REALLY SUPPORTING AND WANTING TO

02:57:08.985 --> 02:57:13.522
TOUGH ISSUES. TOO BIG TO FAIL NO --

02:57:13.589 --> 02:57:19.495

02:57:37.913 --> 02:57:39.815
AUTHORITY.

02:57:39.882 --> 02:57:42.952
UNDER THE FACT THAT -- TO NARROW

02:57:43.019 --> 02:57:44.887
NOT ENOUGH IN.

02:57:44.954 --> 02:57:46.989

GETTING FROM FROM THE FOLKS OF

02:59:17.279 --> 02:59:19.215
TESTIFIED THAT.

02:59:19.281 --> 02:59:20.182

MERE TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES AND

THEY DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO

MAKE LAND USE DECISIONS WHICH

02:59:31.160 --> 02:59:34.396
WHICH WAS CONTEMPLATED IN SB

02:59:34.463 --> 02:59:35.030
THREE SEVEN FIVE SO THAT THEY'LL

02:59:35.097 --> 02:59:36.031
GET THE HAVE LACK OF A

02:59:36.098 --> 02:59:39.268
PARTNERSHIP IN THE MANDATE.

02:59:39.335 --> 02:59:40.669
I MEAN WHAT YOU KNOW BUT I'D

03:00:01.690 --> 03:00:03.359
RIGHT.

03:00:03.425 --> 03:00:04.493
SO THE BILL STILL MAKE

03:00:04.560 --> 03:00:05.861
INDIVIDUAL LAND USE DECISIONS --

03:00:05.928 --> 03:00:08.631
REGARDLESS.

03:00:08.697 --> 03:00:11.000
RIGHT BUT THERE'S NOTHING -- I

03:00:11.066 --> 03:00:11.567

BILL THAT THAT TAKES THAT AWAY.

03:00:14.036 --> 03:00:15.638

I JUST REALIZED. FOR IT.

03:00:36.025 --> 03:00:36.592
THERE'S A TURN YOU'RE ASKING THE

03:00:36.659 --> 03:00:37.993
AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO MAKE AND

03:00:38.060 --> 03:00:39.495
ALL OF A DETERMINATION OF

03:00:39.562 --> 03:00:41.897
WHETHER THEY ARE ON TRACK OR NOT

03:00:41.964 --> 03:00:44.900
WITHOUT AN ANALYSIS OF WHY THEY

03:00:44.967 --> 03:00:46.435
ARE ON OR OFF TRACK.

03:00:46.502 --> 03:00:49.471
AND AND THAT COULD BE -- FOR IT

03:00:49.538 --> 03:00:50.673
COULD BE FOR WHERE HOUSING IS

03:00:50.739 --> 03:00:52.441
LOCATED IT COULD BE BECAUSE THE

03:00:52.508 --> 03:00:54.043
ECONOMY WAS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT

03:00:54.109 --> 03:00:55.578
WE FORECASTED THERE ARE A

03:00:55.644 --> 03:00:57.713
VARIETY OF REASONS AND OUR

03:00:57.780 --> 03:00:58.781
LETTER WILL SPELL OUT THE

03:00:58.847 --> 03:01:00.382
DIFFERENT QUOTES THAT ARE IN THE

03:01:00.449 --> 03:01:01.750
SB ONE FIFTY REPORT.

03:01:01.817 --> 03:01:03.619
THAT SPECIFICALLY SAY WHY AM P.

03:01:03.686 --> 03:01:06.255
O.'S DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER

03:01:06.322 --> 03:01:08.190
EVERYTHING IN THERE ARE TPS YET.

03:01:08.257 --> 03:01:11.794
RIGHT CENTER ON YOUR FOR YOUR

03:01:11.860 --> 03:01:12.394
WHAT YOU GUYS I LOVE JUST TO

03:01:12.461 --> 03:01:14.196
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IF I MAY

03:01:14.263 --> 03:01:16.131
JUST VERY QUICKLY.

03:01:16.198 --> 03:01:16.865
WE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE STATE

03:01:16.932 --> 03:01:18.601
HAS A A NUMBER OF GUIDELINES AND

03:01:18.667 --> 03:01:20.502
REQUIREMENTS ON STATE DOLLARS

03:01:20.569 --> 03:01:22.738
THAT GO TO REGIONS -- THIS IS AN

03:01:22.805 --> 03:01:25.441
ATTEMPT. TO AT LEAST FROM OUR

03:01:25.507 --> 03:01:29.078
PERSPECTIVE TO TO FORTIFY AT THE

03:01:29.144 --> 03:01:30.746
STATE GUIDELINES AND AND TO

03:01:30.813 --> 03:01:32.081
BEGIN.

03:01:32.147 --> 03:01:33.749
TO CONNECT THE STATE GUIDELINE

03:01:33.816 --> 03:01:35.217
ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT IS VERY

03:01:35.284 --> 03:01:38.687
IMPORTANT -- CLIMATE CHANGE.

03:01:38.754 --> 03:01:38.887
I'M.

03:01:38.954 --> 03:01:41.257
INTO REGIONAL DOLLARS THAT ARE

03:01:41.323 --> 03:01:42.725
THAT WAY INTO STATE DOLLARS THAT

03:01:42.791 --> 03:01:44.760
GO TO REGIONS SO WE'RE NOT

03:01:44.827 --> 03:01:47.796
ASKING -- FOR NECESSARILY FOR

03:01:47.863 --> 03:01:49.598
ADDRESSING ALL OF THOSE BUT IF

03:01:49.665 --> 03:01:51.133
IF THE OPPOSITION IS IS

03:01:51.200 --> 03:01:52.268
INTERESTED IN A YOU KNOW THING

03:01:52.334 --> 03:01:53.802
IS NOT GOING FAR ENOUGH AND IT'S

03:01:53.869 --> 03:01:56.005
A YES AND THEN YEAH I THINK THAT

03:01:56.071 --> 03:01:58.274
REALLY HELPS THE CONVERSATION.

03:01:58.340 --> 03:02:00.276
TO BUT TO TO LOOK AT THIS

03:02:00.342 --> 03:02:01.510
RELATIVELY SMALL.

03:02:01.577 --> 03:02:04.213
POT OF MONEY ADMITTEDLY HERE --

03:02:04.280 --> 03:02:05.581
BY THE BY THE OPPOSITION IN THE

03:02:05.648 --> 03:02:08.450
STEP -- 10% OF THE DOLLARS TO

03:02:08.517 --> 03:02:10.019
SAY WELL YOU KNOW MAYBE WE START

03:02:10.085 --> 03:02:11.120
THERE MAYBE WE START WHERE THE

03:02:11.186 --> 03:02:13.188
MAJORITY OF STATE DOLLARS THAT

03:02:13.255 --> 03:02:15.591
GO TO EXPANSION OF ROADWAYS.

03:02:15.658 --> 03:02:17.059
BECAUSE OTHER DOLLARS FOR THEIR

03:02:17.126 --> 03:02:18.627
STATE DOLLARS LIKE SHOP IN OTHER

03:02:18.694 --> 03:02:19.828
MAINTENANCE DOLLARS THOSE DON'T

03:02:19.895 --> 03:02:22.998
GO TO THE ROADWAY EXPANSIONS ARE

03:02:23.065 --> 03:02:24.700
ALMOST NEVER -- BUT THE THE STEP

03:02:24.767 --> 03:02:26.335
IS THAT KIND OF THAT TWEAKING

03:02:26.402 --> 03:02:28.237
POINT RATE IT'S NOT A LOT OF

03:02:28.304 --> 03:02:29.438
MONEY BUT IT DOES.

03:02:29.505 --> 03:02:32.041
SET A LEVEL OF GUIDELINES AND IT

03:02:32.107 --> 03:02:33.709
COMES WITH STATE GUIDELINES AND

03:02:33.776 --> 03:02:35.577
IT COMES WITH A A REQUIREMENT

03:02:35.644 --> 03:02:36.712
THAT THAT WE LOOK AT INTER

03:02:36.779 --> 03:02:39.281
REGIONAL IMPACTS AND WE LOOK AT

03:02:39.348 --> 03:02:40.849
YOU KNOW REGIONAL IMPACTS FROM

03:02:40.916 --> 03:02:42.017
STATE DOLLARS.

03:02:42.084 --> 03:02:44.086
SO WE FELT THAT THAT WAS A GOOD

03:02:44.153 --> 03:02:46.221
STARTING POINT. TO TO USE THE

03:02:46.288 --> 03:02:48.891
STEP BECAUSE IT GOES HEAVILY TO

03:02:48.957 --> 03:02:50.759
ROAD EXPANSION RIGHT NOW THAT IS

03:02:50.826 --> 03:02:52.995
CONTRARY TO OUR STATE GOALS AND

03:02:53.062 --> 03:02:54.129
OUR STATE AND OUR INTENTIONS I

03:02:54.196 --> 03:02:56.098
THINK AND AND COUNTRY REALLY TO

03:02:56.165 --> 03:02:57.166
OVERALL WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

03:02:57.232 --> 03:02:58.801
WILL OF CALIFORNIANS IN

03:02:58.867 --> 03:03:00.636
ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE.

03:03:00.703 --> 03:03:01.470
I AM AS THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT

03:03:01.537 --> 03:03:03.839
IT DOESN'T.

03:03:03.906 --> 03:03:04.873
KNOCK YOU OFF THE LIST AND

03:03:04.940 --> 03:03:07.242
STEPPED JUST DROPS YOU DOWN SO

03:03:07.309 --> 03:03:08.444
THEIR PRECIOUS FUNDS THAT ARE

03:03:08.510 --> 03:03:11.380
AVAILABLE IN THE ABILITY. TO TO

03:03:11.447 --> 03:03:12.815
COMPLETE A PROJECT.

03:03:12.881 --> 03:03:14.883
OPPOSITION YOU HAVE SOMETHING

03:03:14.950 --> 03:03:15.918
ELSE TO ADD -- IF YOU COULD

03:03:15.984 --> 03:03:17.619
CLARIFY SIR JUST VERY BRIEFLY

03:03:17.686 --> 03:03:19.621
YOU ASKED THE QUESTION ABOUT --

03:03:19.688 --> 03:03:21.890
THE ITS CONNECTION TO SB THREE

03:03:21.957 --> 03:03:23.392
SEVENTY FUND OF IT THREE SEVENTY

03:03:23.459 --> 03:03:25.060
FIVE AND AND WHETHER OR NOT THIS

03:03:25.127 --> 03:03:27.930
IS SIMPLY -- TAGGING ON TO AND

03:03:27.996 --> 03:03:30.866
PUTTING TEETH INTO WHAT WE HAD --

03:03:30.933 --> 03:03:32.968
PREVIOUSLY OR WHAT WHAT WHAT IS

03:03:33.035 --> 03:03:34.870
THE LAW TODAY.

03:03:34.937 --> 03:03:35.938
AND I THINK THE IT'S A HUGE --

03:03:36.004 --> 03:03:38.273
DISTINCTION THAT IS WORTHY OF OF

03:03:38.340 --> 03:03:39.908
CONVERSATION AND THAT IS.

03:03:39.975 --> 03:03:43.345
ON THE WHOLE -- PREMISE OF SB

03:03:43.412 --> 03:03:43.879
THREE SEVENTY FIVE AND WE

03:03:43.946 --> 03:03:45.614
THOUGHT IT WAS VALUABLE IS THAT

03:03:45.681 --> 03:03:47.416
YOU GIVE US A GOAL AND I THINK

03:03:47.483 --> 03:03:51.186
IT'S A REASONABLE QUESTION ABOUT

03:03:51.253 --> 03:03:52.888
HOW HOW WE MET AT AS A REGION.

03:03:52.955 --> 03:03:54.423
BUT YOU CAN GIVE US A CALL AND

03:03:54.490 --> 03:03:56.291
WE MADE IT NOT ON A PROJECT BY

03:03:56.358 --> 03:03:58.594
PROJECT BASIS BUT ON A ON A

03:03:58.660 --> 03:04:01.130
STRATEGY BASIS AND THAT WAS

03:04:01.196 --> 03:04:02.131
WRONG THAT'S THAT'S WHY IT'S

03:04:02.197 --> 03:04:03.332
CALLED A A AN SCS.

03:04:03.399 --> 03:04:05.601
A STRATEGY BECAUSE IF YOU START

03:04:05.667 --> 03:04:06.935
PICKING APART INDIVIDUAL

03:04:07.002 --> 03:04:09.004
PROJECTS YOU'LL END UP WITH THE

03:04:09.071 --> 03:04:10.672
VI&lt;c.cyan&gt; WITH THE TRANSIT PROJECT&lt;/c&gt;

03:04:10.739 --> 03:04:11.240
THAT HAS AN INCREASE IN THE

03:04:11.306 --> 03:04:12.808
EMPTY YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT

03:04:12.875 --> 03:04:14.476
EVERYTHING HOLISTICALLY.

03:04:14.543 --> 03:04:16.311
AND SAID THAT THAT THIS BILL

03:04:16.378 --> 03:04:17.913
DOES MAKE A HUGE DEPARTURE FROM

03:04:17.980 --> 03:04:19.581
SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE THAT WAS

03:04:19.648 --> 03:04:21.717
TO LOOK AT THE GLOBAL PICTURE OF

03:04:21.784 --> 03:04:23.152
WHAT ALL THESE PROJECTS LOOK

03:04:23.218 --> 03:04:23.352
LIKE.

03:04:23.419 --> 03:04:24.553
IN COMBINATION.

03:04:24.620 --> 03:04:26.321
AND AND THEN AND THEN EVALUATE

03:04:26.388 --> 03:04:27.689
THEM AND I THINK IT'S COMPLETELY

03:04:27.756 --> 03:04:29.224
UNFAIR TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THE

03:04:29.291 --> 03:04:30.826
EVALUATION.

03:04:30.893 --> 03:04:32.294
BUT WHEN YOU START THIS BILL

03:04:32.361 --> 03:04:34.496
PICKED APART INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS

03:04:34.563 --> 03:04:36.865
AND WE THINK THAT'S A BIG

03:04:36.932 --> 03:04:37.166
DIFFERENCE.

03:04:37.232 --> 03:04:39.168
I THINK -- I WILL MAKE A MOTION

03:04:39.234 --> 03:04:41.703
SINCE I'M THE ONLY PERSON HERE

03:04:41.770 --> 03:04:43.672
ON THE BILL -- AND I WILL ALLOW

03:04:43.739 --> 03:04:47.342
YOU -- SENT AROUND TO CLOSE.

03:04:47.409 --> 03:04:47.876
YEAH.

03:04:47.943 --> 03:04:51.380
I MEAN THERE ARE SOME.

03:04:51.447 --> 03:04:53.816
I I I I YEAH I'VE BLUFF LET LET

03:04:53.882 --> 03:04:55.117
LET ME THEM WE'RE WE'RE NOW IT

03:04:55.184 --> 03:04:56.151
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A CONVERSATION

03:04:56.218 --> 03:04:59.087
THIS AFTERNOON -- THAT THERE ARE

03:04:59.154 --> 03:05:02.825
SOME -- THIS AGREEMENT THAT I

03:05:02.891 --> 03:05:04.693
HAVE ABOUT ABOUT THE OF A WE WE

03:05:04.760 --> 03:05:05.561
CAN PARTS APART WHO'S MAKING THE

03:05:05.627 --> 03:05:06.728
DECISIONS ABOUT INDIVIDUAL

03:05:06.795 --> 03:05:07.996
DEVELOPMENTS AND AND HOW THAT

03:05:08.063 --> 03:05:09.331
FITS INTO THE STRATEGY AND AND

03:05:09.398 --> 03:05:10.365
WILL BE ALLOWED TO LET LET'S

03:05:10.432 --> 03:05:10.866
LET'S HAVE THAT ROBUST

03:05:10.933 --> 03:05:12.034
CONVERSATION IS NO QUESTION THAT

03:05:12.100 --> 03:05:12.501
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES.

03:05:12.568 --> 03:05:13.635
WE HAVE HERE LIKE WE I WAS SO

03:05:13.702 --> 03:05:14.570
MANY THINGS WE'RE TRYING TO DO

03:05:14.636 --> 03:05:15.204
IN THIS COMMITTEE IT INVOLVES

03:05:15.270 --> 03:05:16.839
THE MULTI JURISDICTIONAL WEARING

03:05:16.905 --> 03:05:18.907
OF OF REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

03:05:18.974 --> 03:05:20.209
COUNTY CITIES -- SPECIAL

03:05:20.275 --> 03:05:21.610
DISTRICTS AND EVERYBODY ELSE IN

03:05:21.677 --> 03:05:22.678
BETWEEN AND IT DOES MAKE IT ALL

03:05:22.744 --> 03:05:26.281
VERY CHALLENGING AND I THINK

03:05:26.348 --> 03:05:26.849
WE'RE TRYING TO COME UP WITH

03:05:26.915 --> 03:05:27.749
SOME SORT OF FEASIBLE WAY OF

03:05:27.816 --> 03:05:28.884
ADDRESSING WHAT WE KNOW IS A

03:05:28.951 --> 03:05:31.487
REAL PROBLEM BUT BUT LET'S LET'S.

03:05:31.553 --> 03:05:32.354

ABSENT MEMBERS AND THAT'S MOVED

03:06:10.225 --> 03:06:13.161

CLIMATE ACCOUNTING PROTOCOL.

03:06:24.706 --> 03:06:26.975
THIS IS A BILL THAT YOU KNOW

03:06:27.042 --> 03:06:30.112
ONLY ARCHER EMERITUS COULD LOVE --

03:06:30.178 --> 03:06:31.213
YES IT IS THAT WE'VE BEEN

03:06:31.280 --> 03:06:33.382
TALKING EARLIER ABOUT -- CLIMB

03:06:33.448 --> 03:06:34.283
IT.

03:06:34.349 --> 03:06:35.684
IN A PARTICULAR IT AND A WHAT WE

03:06:35.751 --> 03:06:37.519
ALWAYS SEEM TO TALK ABOUT IS

03:06:37.586 --> 03:06:40.489
CARBON -- GIGI -- BUT THERE

03:06:40.556 --> 03:06:42.224
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS OF LOOKING

03:06:42.291 --> 03:06:44.059
AT THE CLIMATE CHALLENGE AND

03:06:44.126 --> 03:06:45.594
WHEN ASKED TO DO -- WITH

03:06:45.661 --> 03:06:48.030
TEMPERATURE.

03:06:48.096 --> 03:06:49.231
IN HEAT.

03:06:49.298 --> 03:06:52.601
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL SEEKS

03:06:52.668 --> 03:06:53.201
TO TO TO ADD TO THE CARB TOOL

03:06:53.268 --> 03:06:58.340
KIT -- SO.

03:06:58.407 --> 03:06:58.507
SO.

03:06:58.574 --> 03:07:00.175
YOU KNOW.

03:07:00.242 --> 03:07:01.777
WHEN WHEN WHEN THE I. P. C. C.

03:07:01.843 --> 03:07:03.078
THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON

03:07:03.145 --> 03:07:05.981
CLIMATE CHANGE I KNOW THAT THE-TERM ARTIST AS WELL?

03:07:06.048 --> 03:07:08.717
I NEEDED TALKS ABOUT THE

03:07:08.784 --> 03:07:09.518
PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED CLIMATE

03:07:09.585 --> 03:07:11.887
CHANGE IT REALLY FOCUSES ON HOW

03:07:11.954 --> 03:07:13.455
CRUCIAL IS THAT WE KEEP GLOBAL

03:07:13.522 --> 03:07:14.623
AVERAGE TEMPERATURES.

03:07:14.690 --> 03:07:15.958
WITHIN ONE POINT FIVE DEGREES

03:07:16.024 --> 03:07:17.993
CELSIUS OF WHERE THEY ARE NOW TO

03:07:18.060 --> 03:07:20.062
AVOID.

03:07:20.128 --> 03:07:21.663
A RUNAWAY WARMING AFFECTS.

03:07:21.730 --> 03:07:24.032
AND SO I SO AS PART OF THAT --

03:07:24.099 --> 03:07:25.434
IT IT'S REALLY GOTTEN PEOPLE TO

03:07:25.500 --> 03:07:27.069
FOCUS IN ON THE IMPORTANCE OF

03:07:27.135 --> 03:07:28.870
CLIMATE STABILIZATION AND AND

03:07:28.937 --> 03:07:30.639
SPECIFICALLY YOU KNOW -- THOSE

03:07:30.706 --> 03:07:32.040
CRITICAL NEAR TERM ACTIONS WE

03:07:32.107 --> 03:07:33.976
CAN TAKE TO REDUCE ACCESS HEAT

03:07:34.042 --> 03:07:35.944
IN THE ATMOSPHERE.

03:07:36.011 --> 03:07:37.346
SO WE WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THE

03:07:37.412 --> 03:07:38.947
GASES AND THERE'S AN IN A

03:07:39.014 --> 03:07:39.982
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE HEAT.

03:07:40.048 --> 03:07:42.117
BUT BUT BUT THE THE QUESTION IF

03:07:42.184 --> 03:07:43.452
HE IS A IS A A SEPARATE

03:07:43.518 --> 03:07:45.187
STANDALONE IMPORTANT ISSUE FIRST

03:07:45.253 --> 03:07:47.489
LOOK AT SO.

03:07:47.556 --> 03:07:48.557
WHAT ALL THIS BILL DOES

03:07:48.624 --> 03:07:51.493
ULTIMATELY IS GIVE THE A. R. B.?

03:07:51.560 --> 03:07:54.496
I. THE NEEDED ANALYTIC TOOLS TO

03:07:54.563 --> 03:07:56.398
CONSIDER HEAT IN THE ATMOSPHERE

03:07:56.465 --> 03:07:59.201
IS PART OF THE CONVERSATION --

03:07:59.267 --> 03:08:01.870
SO.

03:08:01.937 --> 03:08:03.438
YOU DID JUST TO KIND OF GOING TO

03:08:03.505 --> 03:08:04.106
EXPLAIN THIS A LITTLE BIT OF FOR

03:08:04.172 --> 03:08:05.607
THE FOLKS CAN UNDERSTAND WE TALK

03:08:05.674 --> 03:08:07.009
ABOUT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

03:08:07.075 --> 03:08:08.744
WE USUALLY USE NUMBERS THAT

03:08:08.810 --> 03:08:10.045
CONSIDER THE IMPACTS OF THOSE.

03:08:10.112 --> 03:08:12.114
GASES OVER THE NEXT HUNDRED

03:08:12.180 --> 03:08:13.115
YEARS THAT'S THAT'S REFERRED TO

03:08:13.181 --> 03:08:14.549
AS A GAS IS GLOBAL WARMING

03:08:14.616 --> 03:08:15.917
POTENTIAL.

03:08:15.984 --> 03:08:17.152
AND WHILE LONG TERM IMPACTS ARE

03:08:17.219 --> 03:08:18.487
ESSENTIAL FOR MAKING GOOD PUBLIC

03:08:18.553 --> 03:08:19.755
POLICY DECISIONS.

03:08:19.821 --> 03:08:21.089
I WILL HAVE TO FACE THE FACT IF

03:08:21.156 --> 03:08:22.324
WE DON'T KEEP WARMING AND JACK

03:08:22.391 --> 03:08:23.392
WILL CONTINUE TO FACE PROBLEMS

03:08:23.458 --> 03:08:25.527
CAUSED BY.

03:08:25.594 --> 03:08:26.762
GLOBAL WARMING EVEN NOW.

03:08:26.828 --> 03:08:28.096
AND ANSWER THIS QUESTION IS THIS

03:08:28.163 --> 03:08:29.498
ISSUE OF RADIATIVE FORCING IT'S

03:08:29.564 --> 03:08:30.499
A MEASURE.

03:08:30.565 --> 03:08:32.768
OF HOW MUCH HE IS TRAPPED IN A

03:08:32.834 --> 03:08:35.437
SPECIFIC AREA AT A SPECIFIC TIME.

03:08:35.504 --> 03:08:36.471
AS COMPARED TO GLOBAL WARMING

03:08:36.538 --> 03:08:38.206
POTENTIAL A RADIATIVE FORCING

03:08:38.273 --> 03:08:40.676
LETS US CAN CONSIDER LOCAL FAX.

03:08:40.742 --> 03:08:43.211
OF THINGS LIKE SMOKE LAND USE

03:08:43.278 --> 03:08:44.780
CHANGES RESIDUAL MISSIONS.

03:08:44.846 --> 03:08:46.181
OUR RADIO FORCING AND GLOBAL

03:08:46.248 --> 03:08:47.849
WARMING POTENTIAL.

03:08:47.916 --> 03:08:49.584
WILL IDEALLY WORK HAND IN HAND --

03:08:49.651 --> 03:08:51.086
IN GIVING US A BETTER PICTURE OF

03:08:51.153 --> 03:08:53.789
CHANGES THAT WE CAN -- THEN --

03:08:53.855 --> 03:08:54.856
MAKE THAT WILL BOTH AFFECT

03:08:54.923 --> 03:08:56.758
GLOBAL GLOBAL CLIMATE NOW BUT

03:08:56.825 --> 03:08:58.160
ALSO GLOBAL CLIMATE.

03:08:58.226 --> 03:09:00.162
IN THE FUTURE SO THIS BILL HELPS

03:09:00.228 --> 03:09:01.730
TO MAINTAIN CALIFORNIA.

03:09:01.797 --> 03:09:02.764
I IN ITS LEADERSHIP ROLE IN

03:09:02.831 --> 03:09:03.699
UNDERSTANDING CLIMB IMPLY

03:09:03.765 --> 03:09:05.434
IMPACTS OF HUMAN ACTIONS BY

03:09:05.500 --> 03:09:07.169
MOVING BEYOND JUST THE ISSUE OF

03:09:07.235 --> 03:09:09.337
JEWISH SEASON CARBON -- AND AND

03:09:09.404 --> 03:09:11.006
LOOKING AT A RADIO FORCING AND

03:09:11.073 --> 03:09:13.442
HE AND WITH ME TODAY ARE JO

03:09:13.508 --> 03:09:15.444
CAVES IN THE CONSERVATION

03:09:15.510 --> 03:09:16.011

03:09:31.793 --> 03:09:34.062
JUST VERY BRIEFLY SO THIS BILL

03:09:34.129 --> 03:09:36.064
IS SMALL IT'S TECHNICAL BUT IT'S

03:09:36.131 --> 03:09:37.466
VERY SIGNIFICANT.

03:09:37.532 --> 03:09:38.967
IN THAT IT STARTS THE PROCESS OF

03:09:39.034 --> 03:09:40.869
ALIGNING CALIFORNIA WITH THE

03:09:54.516 --> 03:09:55.417
BUILD UP.

03:09:55.484 --> 03:09:57.619
BUT IT WILL NOT REACH THE GOALS

03:09:57.686 --> 03:09:59.921
THE I. P. C. C. IS IDENTIFIED OF

03:09:59.988 --> 03:10:01.556
REDUCING RADIATIVE FORCING THAT

TO THAT PROCESS OF FIGURING OUT

03:17:41.649 --> 03:17:43.117
HOW TO BRING DOWN HEAT AS WELL

03:17:43.184 --> 03:17:45.353
AS PROVIDING CARBS EXPERTISE

03:17:45.420 --> 03:17:46.821
THAT CAN THEN BE.

03:17:46.888 --> 03:17:48.556
USED BY OTHER COUNTRIES AND SORT

03:17:48.623 --> 03:17:49.991
OF THE DRIVE THE MOMENTUM

COUNTRIES AS OPPOSED TO STATE --

03:18:26.461 --> 03:18:28.563
AND SO THIS WILL PROVIDE THE

03:18:28.630 --> 03:18:29.864
