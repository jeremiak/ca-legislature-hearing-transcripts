COMMITTEE ON ENERGY UTILITIES AND COMMUNICATIONS. WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN AS A SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE. HAVE A FORUM AND HEAR TESTIMONY ON AS JERRY LEVIN. SENATOR MORE LOCAL THE PRESIDING FOR CENTER BATES. THAT'S A MONTH FEEDBACK. THANK YOU MISTER ONE WAS THE MICROPHONE WORKS I WILL CONTINUE BUT IF IT DOES GIVE FEEDBACK I'LL JUST TURN IT OFF. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR CAUGHT. I AM PRESENTING ON BEHALF OF SENATORS BATES REMINDING WHO. AND GIVE ME THIS PRIVILEGE TODAY TO PRESENT SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION ELEVEN. FIRST I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS TO ADD CO AUTHORS. COLLEAGUES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO THE NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY ACT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW REQUIRING WITH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO BEGIN ACCEPTING NUCLEAR WASTE BY NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS FAILED TO FULFILL ITS RESPONSIBILITY. AND THERE HAS BEEN NO SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS TOWARD CONSOLIDATED STORAGE OF USED CIVILIAN NUCLEAR FUEL. EXISTING LAW ONLY ALLOWS FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO TAKE POSSESSION OF HIGH LEVEL RADIOACTIVE WASTE. SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL WHEN IT IS ASSIGNED TO PERMANENT STORAGE AND THERE'S CURRENTLY NO VIABLE PLAN FOR SUCH PERMANENT STORAGE. S. J. R. ELEVEN WOULD URGE CONGRESS TO PASS AND THE PRESIDENT TO SIGN HR TWO NINE NINE FIVE. THE SPENT FUEL PRIORITIZATION ACTIVE TWENTY NINETEEN. HR TWO NINE NINE FIVE PRIORITIZE IS THE REMOVAL OF SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL. FROM DECOMMISSIONED NUCLEAR SITES IN AREAS WITH LARGE POPULATIONS AND HIGH SEISMIC HAZARD WITH OVER NINE MILLION PEOPLE WITHIN FIFTY MILES OF THE SENATE NO FREE NUCLEAR GENERATION STATION. AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCING SOME OF THE GREATEST SEISMIC HAZARD IN THE COUNTRY THE BILL WOULD MAKE SONGS WHICH IS THE ACRONYM FOR THE SENATE NO FREE NUCLEAR GENERATION. STATION ONE OF THE HIGHEST PRIOR SITES IN THE NATION. FOR THE STRATEGIC SHIPPING FOR THE SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL REMOVAL ADDITIONALLY AS J. R. ELEVEN ASK FOR THE DIABLO CANYON NUCLEAR POWER PLANT TO BE PRIORITIZED AS IT IS ALSO LOCATED IN AN AREA OF GREAT SEISMIC THIRD. FOR CALIFORNIA TO SPEAK WITH ONE VOICE ASKING CONGRESS TO ADDRESS THE URGENT ISSUE OF NUCLEAR STORAGE. AND THEREFORE MISTER CHAIR I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR JOHN THE KLAN BEHALF THE COUNTY SAN DIEGO ONE OF THE COUNTIES IMPACTED BY THE CENTER FOR A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT WE- URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF US IT J. R.
