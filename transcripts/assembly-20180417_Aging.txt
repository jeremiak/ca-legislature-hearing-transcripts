WHO'S UNPREPARED TO PRESENT DOUBLE GO AHEAD PROCEED AS A SUB COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE. WELCOME TO OUR FIRST. AND HOPEFULLY. ARE ONLY HEARING AT LEAST ON ASSEMBLY SIDE RIGHT FOR A.

AROUND THE STATE. AND THE FIRST WOMAN SALAS A FOCUS ON LONG TERM CARE ISSUES SECOND WAS A SAN DIEGO FOCUS ON HOUSING AND HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND HOW WE CAN KEEP OUR. AGING COMMUNITY A SENIORS AGING AT HOME. END OF THE THIRD A HEARING WAS LOS ANGELES. OUR FOCUS MUCH ON WHAT POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF WOULD BE FROM FEDERAL A CUT SAID AT LEAST EVEN TO THIS DAY HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED. THAT WOULD WITH QUITE WELL WITHOUT REGULARITY. IN WASHINGTON DC. I THINK THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY NUMBER OF COLLEAGUES INCLUDING MYSELF. THAT ADDRESS A WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES THAT WERE UP TO GLEANED FROM THOSE HEARINGS AND ISA ONE EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE A NUMBER OF YOU THAT ARE HERE. THAT WERE THERE AT THOSE HEARINGS SAW SOME OF YOU AT ALL THREE OF THEM. I WANT TO. THINK A. VERY AND I WE HAVE MY STAFF FOR HELPING MAKE THOSE HEARINGS PRODUCTIVE IMPOSSIBLE AS WELL AS GUILTY OF FROM THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE. FOUR OF HER ENGAGEMENT AS WELL. THE SPEAKER IS BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE CAN DO TO CONTINUE TO HELP. OUR AGING LONG TERM CARE COMMUNITY AND WE. ALL KNOW THAT. MUCH OF WHAT MUCH OF THE CONDITIONS WERE IN OUR CRISIS MODE IN TERMS OF OUR ABILITY TO KICK TAKE CARE. OF OUR QUICKLY OF AGING POPULATION WITH A LACK OF RESOURCES AND FUNDS AND SO. I THINK WE HAVE TO WORK ON THAT. COLLECTIVELY WORK ON THAT TOGETHER. AND SO I'M GRATEFUL TO THE MEMBERS WHO HAVE INTRODUCED BILLS WILL BE HEARING TODAY I THINK THEY'VE. THE COVER A WIDE RANGE ISSUES. REGARDING. ARE THE SENIOR AND AND DISABLED POPULATION. AND I'M HOPEFUL. MODE THAT THEY WILL GO UP SOME WAYS INTO RESOLVING SOME OF THE ISSUES SOME OF THE MANY ISSUES THAT WE FACE IS A STATE.

THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. WHEN WE FIRST OPENED THE DOORS. AB TWENTY ONE OH ONE REGARDING CARE GIVER RESOURCE CENTERS AN OF OUR VOLUNTEER WORK FORCE SUMMER ACOSTA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MISTER VICE CHAIR. GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT AB TWENTY ONE OWNED ONE A BEFORE I BEGIN I WILL BE TAKING THE CLARIFYING COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS UP FOR THE BILL'S DESCRIBED IN THE ANALYSIS. AB TWENTY ONE NO ONE WILL ESTABLISH A WORKFORCE FOR THE ELDERLY WORKING WITH THE CARE GIVER RESOURCE CENTERS TO PROVIDE RESPITE CARE. TO THOSE IN NEED OF IN HOME CARE FROM LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES THAT ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR H. SS. CURRENTLY THERE ARE MORE THAN FOUR MILLION UNPAID FAMILY CARE GIVERS IN CALIFORNIA. THE PP I SEE IS ESTIMATED THAT BY TWENTY THIRTY THE NUMBER OF SENIORS IN NEED OF IN HOME CARE SERVICES WILL HAVE DOUBLED TO OVER NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND. THIS NUMBER DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THOSE WILL BE IN NURSING HOMES SOMETHING THAT MOST MIDDLE AND LOW INCOME FAMILIES CANNOT AFFORD. THE COST FOR ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES AND NURSING HOMES CONSUMERS SIXTY NINE POINT SEVEN PERCENT. AND ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE PERCENT RESPECTIVELY OF THE MEDIAN ANNUAL INCOME OF CALIFORNIANS SOMETHING THAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID HOW ARE UNABLE TO COVER EFFECTIVELY. THIS BILL WILL UTILIZE THE EXISTING STRUCTURE OF THE SEE OUR SEASON WILL ADD ON TO THEIR CAPABILITIES BY CREATING AN INCENTIVE BASED PILOT PROGRAM FOR YOUNG ADULTS. IDEALLY THE PROGRAM WILL BE GEARED FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO WERE INTERESTED IN PURSUING A CAREER IN THE HEALTHCARE FIELD BY PROMOTE PROVIDING EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS. AS WELL AS A MONTHLY STIPEND. THIS PROGRAM WILL ACT AS A TUNNEL BETWEEN SCHOOL AND THE RESPITE CARE FIELD FOR STUDENTS TO GAIN REAL WORLD EXPERIENCE. ENCOURAGE THEM TO GO INTO A FIELD THAT IS EXTREMELY DEPLETED AND IN NEED OF CARE GIVERS. ADDITIONALLY THIS IS AN OPTIONAL PILOT PROGRAM WHICH WILL PROVIDE US WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BEST SERVE THOSE IN NEED OF CARE. I HAVE NEEDS NEED HOLLIS CITY AND HAVE. I HOPE I GOT THAT RIGHT WITH ME TODAY EVEN THOUGH WE WERE HEARST IT AT LEAST TWICE I THINK. WITH ME TODAY REPRESENTING THE SPONSOR THE YOUTH MOVEMENT AGAINST ALZHEIMER'S. AND I HAD ANOTHER. THE EXPERT WITNESS BUT GET TOOK A SIX SO ME HOW MIGHT COVER APPOINTED TO OF OF THERE'S. I MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME CONSIDERATION I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. S. KNOW THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE INTRODUCTION AND THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS AYE AYE ACOSTA AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA FOR THEIR AUTHORSHIP BUT THIS BILL. I'M CHAIR KALRA AND ESTEEMED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ASKING MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE. I HAVE MY NAME IS THE HOUSE I DO IF I AM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS BILL AND ASPIRING PHYSICIAN AND I SERVE HIGHS THE CEO AND COFOUNDER OF THE YOUTH MOVEMENT AGAINST ALZHEIMER'S. AND NONPROFIT THAT STARTED RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND HAS GROWN TO ENGAGING FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS AYE AND IS NOW THE NATION'S LEADER AND YOU ADVOCACY FOR THIS DISEASE. WE AS STUDENTS ARE. ARE CONCERNED OF THE COST OF CARE WILL HOW GROW MEDICARE AND MEDICAID IN THE AN UPCOMING DECADES WE'RE SCARED THAT OUR PARENTS ARE RETIRING INTO A SOCIETY THAT CANNOT GUARANTEE THEM ADEQUATE HOUSING IN CARE. AND AS MILLENNIALS WE ARE INTERESTED IN VOTING FOR LONG TERM SOLUTIONS TO OUR GLOBAL CHALLENGES THAT IF NOT ADDRESS NOW WILL BE UNIVERSALLY IMPACTFUL AS WE REACH OUR FORTIES AND FIFTIES. AND TODAY WE'RE CREATING JUST SUCH A SOLUTION. AB TWO ONE NO ONE CALLS FOR THE CREATION OF A CALIFORNIA CARE CORPSE AT TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION ACROSS FIVE YEARS. TO INCENTIVIZE. AND THAT THAT INCENTIVIZE IS HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE GRADUATES TO PROVIDE FULL TIME CARE TO A SENIOR WITH COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT. IN JUST ONE BILL WE ARE ABLE TO. PROVIDE. IT TO ADD VALUE TO MANY DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS FOR YOUNG INDIVIDUALS LIKE MYSELF THIS PROVIDES A. UNIQUE LIFE PERSPECTIVE AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP SKILLS TO WORK WITH OUR GROWING AGING POPULATION. FOR CURRENT FAMILY CAREGIVERS AN OVERWHELMING AMOUNT WHICH ARE DEALING WITH DEPRESSION THIS OFFERS A MUCH NEEDED BREAK. AND FOR THOSE WITH THE DISEASE. THIS OFFERS A YOUNG INDIVIDUAL FULL OF SPIRIT AND ENERGY TO IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE. FOR CALIFORNIA AND OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. WE ARE ABLE TO ALLEVIATE THE NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES AND ARE LESSEN THE NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES. AND LOWER. YEAH AND. ALLOW CAREGIVERS TO REENTER THE WORKFORCE IF FIFTY PERCENT OF RECIPIENTS OF THIS PROGRAM ARE ABLE TO GO BACK TO WORK AT A MEDIAN SALARY WE WILL BE ABLE TO PAY BACK THE COST OF THIS PILOT IN TEN PERCENT. THROUGH TAXES ALONE. SO HOW DO WE KNOW THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO BENEFIT ALL THESE PARTIES WILL BECAUSE MY NONPROFIT OPERATES AN INTERGENERATIONAL SOCIAL ENTERPRISE AT THE THAT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THAT WAS LAUNCHED AFTER A TWO YEAR PILOT AT UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES. WE TRAIN COLLEGE STUDENT VOLUNTEERS TO PROVIDE. AND PARTNER THEM WITH OLDER ADULTS WITH EARLY TO MID STAGE DEMENTIA IN A COMMUNITY BASED SETTING. FOR SIX HOURS A WEEK DURING WHICH TIME THE CARE GIVERS GET A BREAK WE HAVE QUANTIFIABLE DATA TO SHOW BENEFITS TO ALL PARTIES. THIS OUR IT DID THIS PROGRAM I THINK IS. IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT. TO OUR STATE TO SHOW THAT ONCE AGAIN WE ARE LEADING BY EXAMPLE JUST LIKE CALIFORNIA DID IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR THROUGH THE CURATION OF THE CARE GIVER RESOURCE CENTERS. AND DID AGAIN IN TWO THOUSAND TWO THROUGH THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE ACT. WE AS A STATE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW THAT WE KNOW THAT AMERICA'S CARE GIVERS ARE UNSUNG HEROES AND THAT WE AS A STATE INNOVATE WITH THE FOUNDATION IN COMPASSION. AND ONE THAT. DOT IS PREPARING FOR TOMORROW'S WORKFORCE. I AT ENCOURAGE THAT THE CHAIR AND THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO SEE THIS BILL THROUGH.

WHICH PROVIDE FOR A BOND ISSUE OF TWO ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR CONSTRUCTION AND OR RENOVATION OF THE DAYCARE FACILITIES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE DEMENTIA RELATED MEMORY DISORDERS. AS OTHER SENIORS WHO REQUIRE CARE AND SUPERVISION. I DURING THE DAY AS WELL FOLLOWING THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT RECESSION CALIFORNIANS HAVE SUFFERED DO THAT CLOSURE OF DOZENS OF HOMES AND COMMUNITY ADULT DAY SERVICES. AS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO SERVE THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF PERSONS WITH DEMENTIA AS WELL AS OUR FAMILY CAREGIVERS IN ADDITION MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED ADULT DAY HEALTH CARE FACILITIES. HAVE CLOSED AT THE SAME TIME THAT CALIFORNIA'S PROJECTED SENIOR POPULATION IS GROWING AT A SIGNIFICANT RATE. THESE COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES FOR THE ELDERLY HAVE BEEN REDUCED IN MANY CASES THE COST FOR NONPROFIT OPEN MODERNIZE OUR CONTINUE THE OPERATION OF THESE DAYCARE PROGRAMS FOR THE ELDERLY IS PROHIBITIVE. THE COST OF START UP CONSTRUCTION RENOVATION OR EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT CONSTITUTES THE PRIMARY BARRIER TO CONTINUING OR EXPANDING THESE VALUABLE SERVICES. THIS MEASURE WILL HELP TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE GROWING SENIOR POPULATION WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON THE FRAIL ELDERLY TO ALLOW INDIVIDUALS TO REMAIN IN THEIR HOMES LONGER. PRESERVE THEIR DIGNITY AND QUALITY OF LIFE WHILE ALSO AVOIDING SIGNIFICANTLY MORE COSTLY INSTITUTIONALIZATION HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY TWENTY FIVE A PAT MARTIN AND DON MYERS PERKY.

PLEASE OKAY GREAT ALL MY NAME IS PAT MARTIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INTRODUCING THIS BILL AND THANK YOU. TO THIS ENTIRE COMMITTEE FOR LISTENING TO ME I WAS GOING TO YOU ABOUT MY PERSONAL STORY BECAUSE I THINK IT TELLS IT TELLS Y. THIS BILL IS SO IMPORTANT AND WHY WE NEED THIS TO HAPPEN. MIGHT MY DAUGHTER SAID FOR HER ONE OF THE WORST DAYS OF HER LIFE WAS WHEN HER FATHER SET THE TABLE WITH THREE FORKS AND SPOONS. ONE I. AND SHE WAS SHE WAS FOURTEEN YEARS OLD. AND SHE SAID YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT I KNEW SOMETHING WAS REALLY REALLY WRONG WITH DAD. AND BILL HAD STARTED SHOWING SOME COGNITIVE ISSUES BUT HE WAS. ACTIVE IN HIS CAREER STRESSFUL JOB. MAYBE THAT'S WHAT WAS GOING ON WELL THAT WASN'T WHAT WAS GOING ON. OF BILL WAS DIAGNOSED WITH DEMENTIA. AND. HE HAD TO LEAVE HIS JOB. AND. IT WAS A WAS A GOOD. IN OJAI EARNED EARNING JOB. I ALSO HAD A VERY ACTIVE CAREER WITH THE CLOROX COMPANY AND I HAD TO LEAVE MY JOB TO TAKE CARE OF BILL. BILL WAS FIFTY FIVE I WAS FORTY NINE. SO MY CAREER ENDED AT AGE FORTY NINE. WHEN WE WERE CONFRONTED WITH THIS I LOOKED INTO THE OPTIONS FOR ADULT DAYCARE. WE LIVED IN FREMONT. BIG CITY. AND THERE WERE NO DEMENTIA SPECIFIC FACILITIES. OF FOR ADULT DAYCARE IN FREMONT THERE WERE. DATE FACILITIES FOR THE FRAIL AND ELDERLY THE BILL WASN'T FRAIL WHEN HE WASN'T ELDERLY HE WAS QUITE ACTIVE IN EXCEPT FOR HIS COGNITIVE ISSUES. HE WAS FINE. SO I'VE QUIT MY JOB AND I STARTING CARE OF HIM. FOR ANY OF YOU WHO HAVE EVER. EXPERIENCE IT'S EXHAUSTING. I. NO NOT ONLY DO YOU NOT KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN MOMENT TO MOMENT. YOU. THOUGHT YOU GET ISOLATED YOU DON'T SEE PEOPLE ANYMORE YOUR WORLD GETS SMALLER AND SMALLER YOU DON'T SLEEP BECAUSE IF. WE BUILD OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT I HAD TO DO WITH THAT OR I WOULD JUST BE WORRIED GO WAS GOING TO GET UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT NOT WHO DO WITH THAT. AND I DID MY BEST AND IT GOT WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE AND IT WAS IT WAS BASICALLY TAKING ME OUT. AND THEN I FOUND THE ALZHEIMER'S ACTIVITY CENTER IN SAN JOSE. WHICH MISTER KALRA HAS VISITED AYE AND THE ALSO WAS ACTIVITY CENTER AYE IN THE HEART OF SAN JOSE IS A DEMENTIA SPECIFIC ADULT DAYCARE. AND I WAS ABLE TO TAKE BILL THERE. THEY HAD ACTIVITIES FOR BILL THAT WERE APPROPRIATE PER PERSON HIS AGE HE COULD PUT BOCCE BALL HE COULD PLAY SHUFFLEBOARD HE CAN RUN AROUND THE BACKYARD. AND I KNEW HE WAS IN A PLACE THAT WAS SAFE AND TREATED WITH DIGNITY. AND I COULD GO TO THE GYM WE'RE GOING TO LUNCH WITH SCOTLAND FOR SOMEBODY YOUR TAKE A NAP. JUST HAVE A. HAVE A BREAK. SO I LIKE TO THINK THAT THE ALZHEIMER'S ACTIVITY CENTER SAVE MY LIFE. IT REALLY DID. AND IN FACT NOW I'M ON THE BOARD OF THE ALZHEIMER'S ACTIVITY CENTER BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT IT MEANS SO MUCH TO ME. BUT THEY ALSO WOULD LIKE TO BE CENTER ITS GREATEST IDEAS AND SITTING SAN JOSE. IS THE ONLY DEMENTIA SPECIFIC DAYCARE CENTER IN SAN JOSE. AND SANTA CLARA COUNTY FOR THAT MATTER. IT'S OURS EIGHTY TO NINETY PEOPLE THE DAY. MORE THAN THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE ALZHEIMER'S IN THE COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA. AND WE HAVE ONE FACILITY THAT SERVES EIGHTY TO NINETY. SO THIS TELLS US THE STORY IN THIS IS A VERY POPULATED URBAN AREA. THERE WERE SIX OR THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT HAVE THIS DISEASE IN CALIFORNIA. AND I KNOW. THE SAME SITUATION EVERYWHERE. SO. BE ON THE SORTS OF CAPITAL INVESTMENTS THEY TAKE TIME TO TAKE PLANNING. SO I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY. I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE WAITING ANY ANY LONGER FOR THE SORT OF INVESTMENT SO THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M DONE MYERS PERKY AND I'M THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR AT YOLO ADULT DAY HEALTH CENTER. WHICH IS IN THE COUNTY NEXT DOOR AND I'VE BEEN THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR THERE FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WHO ARE IN THE SAME POSITION AS I AM TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO EXPAND OUR PROGRAMS IN ORDER TO MEET THE JOIN OR MISS NEED? WE'VE BEEN ADVOCATING AND WE ARE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT TWENTY TWENTY FIVE BECAUSE IT REALLY TARGETS THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND IT IS IS DESIGNED FOR NONPROFIT AND GOVERNMENT. AND WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT I NEED NOW I TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. I COME TO YOU TODAY QUITE DESPERATE TO BE QUITE HONEST AND EXHAUSTED I'M EXHAUSTED FROM SPENDING LAST YEAR FIVE YEARS OF MY CAREER TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO EXPAND OUR PROGRAM IN YOLO COUNTY. THERE'S NO CAPITAL MONEY THERE'S NO REDEVELOPMENT DOLLARS THERE'S REALLY NO WAY I CAN GET OUT A LOAN TO DO IT BECAUSE THEN I CAN'T AFFORD THE MORTGAGE. SO I RAN A GOOD CENTER IT'S A MEDIUM SMALL QUITE HONESTLY IN IN. THE CENTER IS THIRTY FIVE YEARS OLD. WE SERVE FIFTY NINE PEOPLE A DAY WE HAVE EIGHTY ONE PEOPLE IN ROLE. AND WITH EACH PARTICIPANT WE SERVE COMES OF OF FAMILY MEMBERS AND IN SOME CASES WE ARE ALSO THE CLOSEST THING TO FAMILIES. WE ARE THE NEED IS GROWING AND I'VE SEEN A STAGGERING. GROWTH IN DEMAND IN MY TWENTY TWO YEARS THERE AND WE HAVE A VERY. SAT WAITING LISTS THERE'S FIFTY SEVEN PEOPLE ON THAT LIST AND THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF TIME THAT YOU ARE ON THAT LIST IS ALMOST TWELVE MONTHS. AND SO. THAT. HAS BEEN TRAXXAS TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN AND BY THE TIME WE GET TO PEOPLE ON THAT LIST. SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN TWENTY FOUR HAVE DIED ON THE WAITING LIST AND FOURTEEN REPLACED IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES NOW WE'RE QUITE PROUD OF OUR CENTER WAS THE FIRST BILL TO PURPOSE ADULT DAY HEALTH CENTER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WITH DOLLARS THAT WERE MADE MADE AVAILABLE. AT THE TIME FOR CENTERS TO BE BUILT. AND WHILE IT WAS STATE OF THE ART THE TIME YOU SHOULD SEE IT NOW. WE HAVE WE HAVE WORK THAT BUILDING OVER I'M WE HAVE TERRIBLE NINE ADA COMPLIANCE. THAT WE'RE GRANDFATHERED IN BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO EXPAND FOR THE SIMPLE FACT THAT IF WE DO WE HAVE TO SPEND ALMOST A MILLION DOLLARS IN RETROFITTING. WE DO NOT HAVE SPRINKLER SYSTEMS WE HAVE TWO TO THREE PEOPLE IN AN OFFICE OUR DOORWAYS ARE ARE NOT WIDE ENOUGH AND WE HAVE FOUR TOILETS FOR ALL THOSE PEOPLE I JUST DESCRIBED AND EIGHTEEN STAFF. IT'S WELL KNOWN IN THE COUNTY THAT WE NEED YOU TO IMPROVE AND EXPAND OUR SPACE AND YOU WOULD THINK OF THE LEADERS IN THE COMMUNICATIVE FAULT WE GET THE SOLUTION. BUT THAT HASN'T BEEN THE CASE I'M WITH DIGNITY HEALTH AND I'M ALSO WELL CONNECTED TO THE COUNTY BECAUSE THE ON THE LICENSE FOR A PROGRAM. THE LEADERSHIPS OF BOTH THOSE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN. IN A TWO YEAR CONTRACT TO TRY AND SOLVE THIS PROBLEM AND THEY HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DO SO AND HAVE JUST RESIGNED A SECOND TWO YEAR CONTRACT. HOPING THAT PERHAPS WE CAN SAVE THE PROGRAM WE LOSE CLOSE TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND NOBODY CAN AFFORD TO COVER THAT FOR US ANYMORE AND MET IN ITS SIMPLY BECAUSE MEDICARE'S REIMBURSEMENT RATE DOESN'T COVER THE COST. IF WE COULD EXPAND OUR PROGRAM TO SERVE A HUNDRED PEOPLE A DAY WE WOULD BREAK EVEN THAT'S ALL WE'RE LOOKING FOR. AND THERE IS SUCH A NEED OUT THERE BUT WHERE IS THE CAPITAL COME FROM. AND LIKE I SAID WE CAN'T AFFORD A LARGE MORTGAGE THE HOSPITAL CLINIC SYSTEMS AND COMMITTEE PROVIDERS KEEP SENDING US REFERRALS DISCHARGE PLANNERS IN HOSPITAL SOCIAL WORKERS CALL ALL THE TIME COULD YOU PLEASE BUMPS OWN SO UP THE LIST. WE REALLY. WITH VERY A VERY DESPERATE SITUATION AND THE WAITING LIST GROWS IF I WERE AWARDED TWO MILLION DOLLARS. OF THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION THAT'S ONE ONE THOUSANDTH. OF WHAT MIGHT BE AVAILABLE TO ALL PROVIDERS IN THE STATE I COULD CHANGE THE COURSE OF LONG TERM CARE COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES IN YOLO COUNTY AND POSITIVELY IMPACT THE LIVES FOR MANY MANY YEARS TO COME. THAT'S JUST MY STORY AB TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IS CAPABLE OF GROWING I SPOTTED INFRASTRUCTURE INTO A REAL SYSTEM OF CARE FOR CALIFORNIANS A SYSTEM THAT SAVES HEALTHCARE DOLLARS. PROMOTES QUALITY OF LIFE CREATES JOBS HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU KNOW TODAY WHO ARE LOSING THEIR INDEPENDENCE DUE TO CHRONIC DISEASE OR AGE OR DEMENTIA I'M GUESSING THE LIST IN YOUR HEAD INCLUDES FAMILY MEMBERS FRIENDS NEIGHBORS CO WORKERS.

CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF AGENTS AGING ADMINISTERS PROGRAMS FOR OUR STATE SENIOR POPULATION AND PRIORITIZE A CERTAIN FUNDING FOR INDIVIDUALS IDENTIFIED AS IN. GREATEST SOCIAL OR ECONOMIC NEED ALREADY PRIORITIZING THOSE WITH LANGUAGE BARRIERS AND SOCIAL ISOLATION CALIFORNIA'S MOST RECENT STATE PLAN ON AGING SEEKS TO BETTER SERVE MEMBERS OF OUR LGBTQ COMMUNITY. HISTORICALLY MEMBERS OF THIS COMMUNITY A FACE MANY TYPES OF DISCRIMINATION WHICH CAN CONTRIBUTE TO ECONOMIC INSECURITY OR LACK OF ADEQUATE HEALTH CARE. WITHIN THE STATE'S ELDERLY COMMUNITY LGBTQ INDIVIDUAL STILL FACE VARIOUS FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION THAT CAN LEAD TO SOCIAL ISOLATION AND VARIOUS OTHER HEALTH CHALLENGES. AS CALIFORNIA MOVES FORWARD TOWARD RECOGNIZING THESE THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF LGBTQ SENIORS AB TWENTY SEVEN NINETEEN CONTINUOUS EFFORT BY ENSURING THAT THEY ARE INCLUDED IN PRIORITIZE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. TODAY WITH ME HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT IS JOE MICHAEL WITH THE QUALITY CALIFORNIA. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS JOHN MICHAEL FOR EQUALITY CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE PROUD TO BE A CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL ALONG WITH SAGE THE NATIONAL ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION FOR LGBTQ OLDER ADULTS. SO I'M GOING TO ATTEMPT TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF BOTH OF US TODAY BRIEFLY. AND DATA AND RESEARCH AND THE EXPERIENCE OF SAGE AND ITS AFFILIATES AND EQUALITY CALIFORNIA AS WELL AND AND I ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY CONFIRMED THAT LGBTQ OLDER ADULTS FACE A NUMBER OF BARRIERS TO SUCCESSFUL AGING. AND HIGHER RATES OF SOCIAL ISOLATION THERE TWICE AS LIKELY TO LIVE ALONE AND HALF AS LIKELY TO HAVE CLOSE RELATIVES TO CALL FOR HELP. LGBTQ OLDER ADULTS ALSO FACE HIGHER RATES OF POVERTY AND THAN THEIR NON LGBTQ PEERS NEARLY SIXTEEN PERCENT OF SINGLE GAY MEN OVER SIXTY FIVE LIVE IN POVERTY. COMPARED TO JUST NINE POINT SEVEN PERCENT OF SINGLE STRAIGHT MEN THEIR AGE. SIX PERCENT OF LESBIAN COUPLES AGE SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER HAVE INCOMES BELOW THE POVERTY LINE COMPARED TO THREE POINT FIVE PERCENT OF MARRIED DIFFERENT SEX COUPLES IN THE SAME AGE GROUP. AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE LGBTQ OLDER ADULTS ALSO FACE PRONOUNCED HEALTH DISPARITIES. SO DESPITE THESE NEEDS TO RELY ON SERVICE PROVIDERS LGBTQ OLDER ADULTS LACK CULTURALLY COMPETENT CARE AND SERVICES. ON A STUDY INDICATES THAT LGBTQ OLDER ADULTS ARE TWENTY PERCENT LESS LIKELY THAN OTHER OLDER ADULTS TO ACCESS GOVERNMENT SERVICES LIKE HOUSING ASSISTANCE MEAL PROGRAMS FOOD STAMPS AND SENIOR CENTERS. ALL THIS BACKGROUND REALLY EMPHASIZES THE NEED FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF AGING TO BE A LEADER IN PROVIDING LGBTQ INCLUSIVE SERVICES AND THIS BILL IS PART OF BUILDING THAT LEADERSHIP SO WHERE'S THE COMMITTEE SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU.

OTHER RISK HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE OF THAT ISOLATION ABUSE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THE BY THE THIS BILLBOARD AND YOU ME CLOSE. SPECTRALLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU.

ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE IS THE THIRD LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN CALIFORNIA AND ONLY IN THE ONLY DISEASE IN THE TOP TEN CAUSES OF DEATH WITHOUT APPROVING BECAUSE. PREVENTIVE ACTION OR CURE IN CALIFORNIA TODAY SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS ARE LIVING WITH THE DISEASE. FOR ME AND FOR MANY OTHER CALIFORNIANS THIS IS A DEEPLY PERSONAL ISSUE AS MY OWN GRANDMOTHER HAS. A TRAVEL THROUGH THE ALZHEIMER'S SPACE HAND MY FAMILY HAS FACED THE STRUGGLE OF DEMENTIA CARE. AB NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE PROMOTES COMMUNITY EDUCATION AND PUBLIC AWARENESS OF THE SYMPTOMS OF ALZHEIMER'S AND PROVIDES INFORMATION AND RESOURCES FOR INDIVIDUAL. FAMILIES MEMBER FOR INDIVIDUALS FAMILY MEMBERS AND CAREGIVERS AFFECTED BY ALZHEIMER'S AND RELATED DEMENTIAS. AB NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE WOULD IMPLEMENT A PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN TO REDUCE STIGMA AND RAISE PUBLIC AWARENESS. OF THE WARNING SIGNS OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND DEMENTIA IN ORDER TO PROMOTE EARLY. DETECTION AND ACCURATE DIAGNOSES. EARLY DETECTION AND DIAGNOSIS IS A CRITICAL STEP TOWARDS IMPROVING HEALTH OUTCOMES LORRAINE HEALTHCARE COSTS AND ENSURING ACCESS TO BENEFICIAL INTERVENTIONS TODAY WITH ME I HAVE DEREK HELT XIN JOHN LUCAS TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JOHN LUCAS. I'M A VOLUNTEER ADVOCATE FOR THE ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION. MY WIFE AND I.

AND FINALLY AN INVASIVE LUMBAR TAP TO DRAW SPINAL FLUID FROM HER TO GET THE DIAGNOSIS. WE FINALLY GOT THAT DIAGNOSIS I WAS COMPLETELY UNTRAINED. AS TO WHAT I WAS GOING TO HAVE TO DO OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. AND TWENTY FOUR HOUR PERIOD AFTER GIVING THE DIAGNOSIS I HAD TO MAKE A DECISION ON WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO WITH MY CAREER. I DECIDED TO RETIRE. MUCH EARLIER THAN I EVER PLAN. I HAVE NO TIME TO PREPARE. AS A DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS OF A MAJOR SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANY I LEFT MY ENTIRE ORGANIZATION AND MY BOSS THE VP OF THAT ORGANIZATION IN A LURCH. AND NO ONE TO DO MY JOB. I TOOK CARE SHARON HOME TWENTY FOUR SEVEN FOR A LITTLE OVER TWO YEARS. I FINALLY BURNED OUT WAS ON THE VERGE OF DEPRESSION AND DIDN'T THINK I WAS GONNA MAKE.

I KIND OF KNOW HOW THINGS WORK IN THIS WORLD. I HAD LOTS OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO ME IN THAT IN THE A IN THE SANTA CLARA VALLEY. BUT YOU YET EVEN WITH ALL THAT. I DO KNOW WHAT TO DO. I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW DIFFICULT THIS IS. OR PEOPLE AND LESS FORTUNATE SITUATIONS IN MY. HAD WE HAD AWAY FOR EARLY DETECTION BACK THEN. THE DISEASE. A FOR THE DISEASE THINGS WHAT ABOUT A LOT WHOLE LOT BETTER IN A WHOLE LOT EASIER FOR MY MYSELF AND MY FAMILY. WE COULD PUT A FINANCIAL PLAN TOGETHER FOR ONE THING. ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE DISEASE IN AMERICA. IT'S GONNA COST THE COUNTRY OVER A QUARTER TRILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR ALONE. PERSONALLY I'VE SPENT OVER FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OUT OF POCKET FOR HER CARE IN THE U. S. USE IN THE RESIDENTIAL FACILITY. I COULD A PLAN THE TRANSITION FROM MY JOB. CRITICS IN MONTHS OR YEARS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET OUT OF MY POSITION LET SOMEBODY ELSE TAKE OVER. WE COULD LEARN ABOUT THE CARE THAT SHE WAS GOING TO NEED. I COULD I PUT A PLAN IN PLACE FOR THAT WE HAD NONE. BECAUSE BEEN A LOT MORE TIME TOGETHER AS A FAMILY HAD WE KNOWN THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN YEARS IN ADVANCE. ESPECIALLY. OUR TIME BETWEEN HER DAUGHTERS AND HER. WE CAN ACROSS THINGS OFFER BUCKET LIST BEFORE SHE WAS TOO SICK TO ENJOY AND APPRECIATE THEM. IN CONCLUSION I'D LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN THE MALL.

ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES YES I YES I. THIS IS FILE ITEM SEVEN A. B. TWO SEVEN FOUR FOUR SO WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. AND YOUR WITNESS ALREADY MAY. PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. AB TWO SEVEN FOUR FOUR PROVIDES CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AROUND THE ACTIVITIES OF REFERRAL AGENCIES FOR FAMILIES LOOKING TO PLACE PRIMARILY DISABLED AND ELDERLY FAMILY MEMBERS. INTO LONG TERM RESIDENTIAL CARE. THIS BILL WILL ASSURE THAT CONSUMERS HAVE CLEAR TRANSPARENT INFORMATION ABOUT THE REFERRAL PROCESS. FINDING QUALITY HOUSING AND CARE FOR A LOVED ONE. CAN BE DAUNTING. EVEN THAT UNDER THE MOST IDEAL CIRCUMSTANCES. FOR MOST THIS DECISION CAN FEEL RUSHED CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT THAT MAKES FAMILIES AND SENIORS. MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO PRESSURE AND MISINFORMATION. UNFORTUNATELY THE CONSUMER OFTEN DOES NOT HAVE THE TIME RESOURCES OR EXPERTISE TO MAKE THE MOST INFORMED DECISION FOR THEMSELVES OR THEIR LOVED ONES. ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO ELDER CARE PLACEMENT AND HOUSING OPTIONS. IT IS AT THIS JUNCTURE THE REFERRAL AGENCIES CAN BE OF GREAT HELP. OR GREATER HARM TO CALIFORNIANS. REFERRAL AGENCIES OFFER SENIORS AND FAMILIES ASSISTANCE IN FINDING PLACEMENT IN A CARE FACILITY. USUALLY A LICENSED RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITY FOR THE ELDERLY. THESE ARE OFTEN FREE OF CHARGE TO THE PERSON BEING REFERRED. THESE REFERRAL AGENCIES ARE LARGELY UNREGULATED IN CALIFORNIA AND FINANCIAL INCENTIVES THEY RECEIVE. ARE NOT ALWAYS CLEARLY DISCLOSED TO THE SENIOR BEING PLACED OR THEIR FAMILIES. REFERRAL AGENCIES ALSO ARE NOT ALWAYS NECESSARILY FAMILIAR WITH THE FACILITIES TO WHICH THEY'RE REFERRING SENIORS OR EVEN THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF THE SENIOR THEY ARE REFERRING. THIS BILL ADDRESSES THESE ISSUES AND PROVIDES THE NEEDED TRANSPARENCY AND PROTECTION. HERE TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THE BILL IS LINDA ARE MOST. DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL REFERRAL EMPLACEMENT ALLIANCE AND RONALD SIMPSON DIRECTOR AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PRESIDENT OF SIXPENCE INK. ALONG WITH THE ROCKS AND GOULD FROM GOLD GOVERNMENT RELATIONS WHO WILL COME UP TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THANK YOU ESPECIALLY. ASSEMBLY WOMAN RADIUS FOR AUTHORING SUCH AN IMPORTANT BELL. WHEN AN ELDERLY PERSON MAKES WHAT'S OFTEN THE LAST TO MOVE THAT THEIR LIFE. IT'S RARELY A JOYFUL HAPPY OCCASION IT USUALLY INVOLVES COMPLICATION. COMPLICATED EMOTIONS STRESS CONFUSION AND GUILT. AND THAT USUALLY WITH FORTY EIGHT HOURS OR LESS NOTICE. PREVIOUSLY THIS PROFESSION HAS BEEN COMPLETELY UNREGULATED WITH NO CONSUMER PROTECTIONS OUR MINIMUM STANDARDS. MANY PEOPLE ARE NOT EVEN AWARE OF THE VALUABLE SERVICE. THAT SENIOR REFERRAL AGENCIES CAN PROVIDE UNTIL THERE'S A NEED TO FIND CARE FOR AN ELDERLY FAMILY MEMBER USUALLY IN A CRISIS. THEN THERE IS NO TIME TO SHOP AROUND. FOR HELP THE THE PUBLIC MAKES REASONABLE ASSUMPTIONS WHEN THEY READ PROMISES ABOUT EXPERT ADVISORS THAT WILL HOLD THEIR HAND THROUGH EVERY STEP OF THE PROCESS. TO HELP THEM FIND PLACES TAILORED TO THEIR UNIQUE NEEDS. THEY DON'T THINK TO QUESTION WHETHER THAT SENIOR HOUSING ADVISER SLASH EXPERT HAS EVER EVEN SEEN OUR KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT THE PLACES THEY ARE RECOMMENDING. IT SHOULDN'T MATTER WHERE WHETHER A FAMILY IS SEARCHING ONLINE OR USING A LOCAL REFERRAL AGENCY. CONSUMER EXPECT EXPECTATIONS AND NEEDS ARE THE SAME AND THE STATE'S SAME STANDARD SHOULD APPLY. TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE DO MATTER. THERE'S A CONDITION CALLED RELOCATION STRESS SYNDROME OR TRANSFER TRAUMA WHICH CAN CAUSE CRITICAL EMOTIONAL. AND BEHAVIORAL SYMPTOMS ESPECIALLY AND FRAIL OR CONFUSED ELDERLY. SEARCHING FOR APPROPRIATE HOUSING AND CARE IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN SHOPPING FOR APPAREL SHOES ARE AN OUTFIT THAT CAN BE RETURNED IF IT'S NOT A GOOD FIT. A PLACE THAT'S PERFECT FOR ONE MAY BE COMPLETELY WRONG OR EVEN DANGEROUS FOR ANOTHER. FAMILY SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO HONEST DISCLOSURE THAT THE AGENCY WILL BE PAID A COMMISSION. AND THE RIGHT TO CANCEL AND WORK WITH ANOTHER AGENCY IF NOT SATISFIED WITH THE SERVICE THEY RECEIVE. THERE ARE MULTITUDES OF INNOCUOUS LOOKING WEBSITES POSING AS INFORMATIONAL SITES. THAT MEAN WE SERVE TO CAPTURE CONTACT INFORMATION. THAT CAN BE SOLD OR USED TO REFER PEOPLE TO ASSISTED LIVING PASS THE FACILITIES FOR A COMMISSION. OFTEN THE FAMILY HAS NO KNOWLEDGE THIS HAS HAPPENED UNTIL THEIR PHONE STARTS RINGING. THE COMPANY CAN ALSO CLAIM TO REPRESENT THAT CLIENT INDEFINITELY WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION. EVEN AFTER BEING TOLD DECEASED CONTACT AND AY STILL COLLECT COMMISSIONS YEARS LATER. BECAUSE OF TERMS THAT ARE BURIED IN THE FINE PRINT OF PRIVACY POLICY. TEXAS THE WHICH NOBODY EVER READ. BECAUSE THEY NEVER ACTUALLY OPTED IN THERE IS NO WAY FOR FAMILIES TO OPT OUT FAMILIES DESERVE CHOICES AND TRANSPARENCY. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AB TWENTY SEVEN FORTY FOUR IS ABOUT PROTECTING SENIORS AND THEIR FAMILIES. NAVIGATING THIS COMPLICATED PROCESS OF FINDING AN APPROPRIATE CARE FACILITY. FAMILIES IN NEED OF THIS SERVICE ARE USUALLY IN CRISIS. IT IS ALSO A DIFFICULT EMOTIONAL TIME OVER FIFTY PERCENT OF THOSE. SEEKING HELP FEEL GUILTY ABOUT MAKING THIS PLACEMENT. CONSEQUENTLY THEY ARE EVEN MORE VULNERABLE OFTEN UNAWARE WHEN THEY GO ON THE INTERNET SEEKING INFORMATION THEY ARE AGREEING TO ALLOW THE REFERRAL AGENCY TO DISCLOSE AND EVEN SELL OUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. MORE TRANSPARENCY IS NEEDED IN THIS AREA AND THIS BILL WILL CODIFY THAT REQUIREMENT. JUST A WEEK AGO I MET WITH A GENTLEMAN LOOKING TO PLACE HIS MOTHER. HE TOLD ME. THAT DAYS BEFORE HE WENT ON THE INTERNET SEEKING INFORMATION ANY HARDLY FINISHED WHEN HE HUNG UP THE PHONE AND WINNIE FINISHED AND GOT OFF THE INTERNET HIS PHONE STARTED RINGING NONSTOP. PEOPLE SEEKING HELP FROM REFERRAL AGENTS EXPECT INDIVIDUALS REPRESENTING THEMSELVES AS EXPERTS TO UNDERSTAND BASIC CARE REQUIREMENTS FOR SUCH THINGS AS COGNITIVE LOSS DIABETES CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE. CURRENTLY THERE ARE NO TRAINING REQUIREMENTS ANYONE. ANYONE CAN SAY THAT THEY ARE AN EXPERT REFERRAL AGENT. WE NEED TO CHANGE THIS AND ESTABLISH MINIMAL TRAINING REQUIREMENTS SO FAMILIES ARE REASSURED THAT REFERRAL AGENTS CAN EVALUATE AND MAKE APPROPRIATE PLACEMENTS. THERE IS GRAFT AND COLLUSION IN THIS INDUSTRY THAT INFLUENCES THE WAY CLIENTS ARE ACQUIRED AND REFERRALS ARE MADE. THIS RESULTS IN REFERRALS MADE FREQUENTLY FOR FINANCIAL GAIN NOT FOR THE BEST INTEREST OF THE NEEDY SENIOR. THE IS PERVASIVE INDUSTRY KICKBACKS CONTINUE EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE UNETHICAL IF NOT ILLEGAL. THIS CREATES UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES AND EVEN WORSE AN INCENTIVE FOR PLACEMENT AND FACILITIES THAT ARE NOT APPROPRIATE. THIS BILL OPENS TO PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANT MEANS OF ENFORCEMENT ONE. ACTION IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. TO REMOVAL FROM THE REGISTRY BY DSS MAKING IT ILLEGAL TO PROVIDE A REFERRAL. CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE. I AM WORRIED YOU TO SUPPORT THIS IMPORTANT.

THANK YOU WELL ANYONE. ELSE'S SUPPORT. THANK YOU. I ALSO OWN A. CARE FACILITY. AND I'M IN SUPPORT WITH THIS BILL OKAY THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE'S SUPPORT IF NOT. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS. I PATRICK SHANNON AND I REPRESENT CARING DOT COM WITH THE LARGEST CALIFORNIA BASED REFERRAL AGENCY. AND WE ARE AN INFORMATION SERVICES COMPANY OPERATING ON AN INTERNET MODEL. AND WE HELP FAMILIES IDENTIFY SENIOR HOUSING OPTIONS THROUGH RATINGS REVIEWS VIDEO AND ADVICE FROM OUR FAMILY ADVISERS. ALL FREE TO THE CONSUMER. THAT WE SUPPORT CONCEPTS IN THE BILL SUCH IS DISCLOSURE OF THE FOLLOWING. WHETHER THE FACILITY COMPENSATES THE REFERRAL AGENCY. IT'S GOOD. DISCLOSURE A PRIVACY POLICY THE INFORMATION SHARING POLICY AND THE TELEPHONE CALLING POLICY. PLUS THE INSURANCE COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS THE BAN ON THE POWER OF ATTORNEY. NOW WHILE WE SUPPORT CONSUMER PROTECTION IN THE INDUSTRY AND INDEED PRACTICE IT OURSELVES WE OPPOSE THE BILL AS OVER BROUGHT IN OTHER RESPECTS AND IN FACT DISCRIMINATORY AGAINST THE INTERNET BUSINESS MODEL. A LESS EGREGIOUS VERSION OF THIS BILL AN SP SIX FORTY EIGHT WAS ALREADY VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. AS TOO EXPANSIVE AND UNNECESSARY. HE SAID THE PROPONENTS HAD FAILED TO PRODUCE A CONVINCING CASE FOR THE NEED FOR THE BILL. OVER THE REGULATION IN CURRENT LAW. S. B. SIX FORTY EIGHT ALSO PREVIOUSLY FAILED NOT ONCE BUT TWICE IN THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AGAIN AS UNNECESSARY. NOW NOTE THAT OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS THE PROPONENTS HAVE PRODUCED NO ACTUAL EVIDENCE OF ANY PROBLEM TO BE RECTIFIED. NO STUDIES. NO SURVEY OF COMPLAINTS AGAINST REFERRAL AGENCIES NO EVIDENCE OF ANY REGULATORY OR DA ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. WE CANNOT LEGISLATE BY INNUENDO. PROPONENTS OF PRODUCED NO INDICATE EVIDENCE INDICATE THAT THE EXISTING THREE TIERED REGULATORY SYSTEM IN PLACE FOR THE LAST TWENTY SEVEN YEARS AND REGULATED BY DSS IS NOT WORKING. HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE SECTION FIFTEEN SIXTY NINE POINT FORTY SEVEN PUNISHES AS A MISDEMEANOR ANY INAPPROPRIATE REFERRAL TO AN UNLICENSED FACILITY OR THE WRONG LEVEL OF CARE. FACILITIES ARE REQUIRED BY STATUTE. TO CONDUCT A RIGOROUS SUITABILITY DETERMINATION BEFORE ADMITTING A RESIDENT. AND DSS POLICES THE REFERRAL AGENCIES AND THE FACILITY FOR VIOLATIONS. NOW OF CONSUMER PROTECTION IS THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL WHY ARE SEVENTY PERCENT OF ALL REFERRALS EXEMPT FROM THIS BILL. ALL OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL SHOULD APPLY TO ALL REFERRAL SOURCES EQUALLY INCLUDING SELF REFERRALS BY FIFTY PERCENT WHICH REPRESENT FIFTY PERCENT OF ALL REFERRALS. AND SO CALLED PROFESSIONAL SERVICES PROVIDERS LIKE LAWYERS AND DOCTORS IN THE STATE PLANNERS WHO REPRESENT TWENTY PERCENT OF THE REFERRALS. THE BILL ONLY REGULATES BUSINESS REFERRAL AGENCIES AND THAT'S ONLY THIRTY PERCENT. BUT THIS BILL ADDS EVEN MORE REGULATION OVER BUSINESS REFERRALS. AGENCIES UNIQUELY AN EXCLUSIVELY AND VEERS FAR OFF COURSE INTO A TURF WAR SEEKING TO LEGISLATE ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES FOR THE LOCAL AGENCIES. THE SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL OVER THE INTERNET AGENCIES AND FOR THE FACILITIES OVER THE REFERRAL AGENCIES. THIS MAY HELP EXPLAIN WHY THE CONSUMER FEDERATION THE SPONSOR OF S. B. SIX FORTY EIGHT IS NOT. SUPPORTING THIS BILL. I CAN LIST SOME OF THESE PROVISIONS THAT THE BILL SEEKS TO SUPER WIEN AND NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS BETWEEN THEIR FOR ALL AGENCIES IN THE FACILITIES. AND REPLACE THEM WITH LEGISLATIVE LEAD. DICTATED PROVISIONS THAT SKEW THE ECONOMICS OF THE RELATIONSHIP. IF YOU WILL LET ME GO FOR MAYBE ANOTHER MINUTE I CAN GIVE YOU A SENSE OF WHERE THE DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES LAW. OF ALL THAT YOU USE THAT AS YOUR CLOTHES SUCH ELECTED CHAU ANECDOTES TO THAT OKAY. YET WELL IMAGES AND IT DOES SO THE LOCAL AGENCY OF SOUGHT TO ELIMINATE A CORE PRINCIPLE CALLED THE FIRST IN CONTRACT PROVISION WHICH REFERRAL AGENCIES USE NATIONWIDE. AND INSTEAD OF LEAVING THE DECISION OF HOW AGENCIES ARE COMPENSATED TO NEGOTIATIONS THE BILL BASICALLY TRIES TO AVOID THE FIRST IN PROVISION. SIMILARLY THE LOCAL AGENCIES HAVE SOUGHT A ONE AND DONE RULE WHERE REFERRAL AGENTS DON'T GET CREDIT FOR SUBSEQUENT REFERRALS IF THERE'S A MOVE OUT AGAIN THAT'S THE SUBJECT OF NEGOTIATION BETWEEN FACILITIES AND REFERRAL AGENCIES. IT'S NOT THE IDEA TO REPLACE NEGOTIATION WITH A LEGISLATION. SO IN CLOSING WHAT I'D SAY IS I WANT TO BE CLEAR. OUT WE ALL LIKE SOME PROVISIONS OF THE BILL BUT THOSE THAT ARE DISCRIMINATORY OR BURDENSOME WE OPPOSE THE PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT TEND TO SKEW THE ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP TO BENEFIT. THE LOCAL AGENCIES OVER THE INTERNET AGENCIES AND I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE TO IDENTIFY AND EXTRACT THOSE PROVISIONS. WELL THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN CLIPPER HERE IN BEHALF OF A PLACE FOR MOM OF THE NATION'S PROBABLY LEADING AND LARGEST INTERNET UP REFERRAL AGENCY. WE SUPPORTED S. B. SIX FORTY EIGHT. SENATOR MENDOZA IS BILL THAT WAS SUPPORTED BY CONSUMER FEDERATION. THAT WAS FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON CONSUMER PROTECTION% AND CONSUMER DISCLOSURES WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THOSE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL. WHEN THE BILL WAS FIRST INTRODUCED. AND HEARD IN HUMAN SERVICES รณ WE WERE OPPOSE. INITIALLY BECAUSE OF A NUMBER OF PROVISIONS THAT SOUGHT TO REGULATE THE BUSINESS TO BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FACILITIES AND REFERRAL AGENCIES. WHICH ARE THE SUBJECT OF CONTRACTS IN OUR BB RELATIONSHIPS. ARE WE WORK WITH THE AUTHOR IN THE U. MEANT SERVICES COMMITTEE TO RESOLVE MOST OF THOSE ISSUES WE ONLY HAVE ONE MORE ISSUE INSIGNIFICANT ISSUE LEFT WITH THE BILL WE ARE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ON THAT. AND WE HOPE TO RESOLVE THAT AND BE ABLE TO LEVY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL WE DO SUPPORT. TRANSPARENCY CONSUMER CONSUMER DISCLOSURE BUT WE DON'T THINK THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD GET INVOLVED IN BUSINESS TO BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS THERE'S SUBJECT OF CONTRACT AND. THE FEES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THOSE BIZARRE RELATIONSHIPS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. OKAY I WILL BRING A BACK UP TO THE COMMITTEE FOR COMMENTS QUESTIONS. YES SOME OUR COPIER. YES ACTUALLY IF YOU COULD ADDRESSED KIND OF THE LAST COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE M. IN TERMS OF YOUR POSITION ON THE BILL IT WOULD BE HELPFUL JUST TO KNOW WHAT WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE IN TERMS OF THE. TIM THE CONCERNS WITH THE ELECTRONIC FOR ALL SYSTEM AND THAT BUSINESS TO BUSINESS CONTRACT RELATIONSHIP. I'M NOT SINGLE REPRESENTING SIX BEDS UP OUR INTEREST. HAS ACTUALLY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BUSINESS MODEL HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH AN INTERNET MODEL IT'S REALLY. AN INTERESTING TRANSPARENCY AND DISCLOSURE AND I'M ON MY EXPERIENCE WAS THAT I WAS TRYING TO FIND A PLACE FOR MY MOM. I'M IN REPRESENTS EXPENSE I HAD THE BENEFIT OF HAVING AN ACTUAL NAME OF FACILITY I DID A GOOGLE SEARCH I ENDED UP GOING THROUGH SIX PAGES OF DIFFERENT FACILITIES WITH PICTURES APPEARING TO BE THE HOME I WAS LOOKING FOR. AND EACH TIME I CALLED IT WAS REFERRAL AGENCY AND WAS NO DISCLOSURE THAT THAT'S WHAT IT WAS IT WASN'T UNTIL I GOT TO THE ALZHEIMER'S PAGE. THAT ACTUALLY FOUND THE HOME I WAS LOOKING FOR SO WHAT IT IS REALLY ABOUT IS MAKING SURE THAT IT IS IT IS REFERRAL AGENCY. THEY ARTICULATE THAT THAT IS CLEARLY DISCLOSED THAT IF THERE IS IN FACT A FEE BEING PAID UNLIKE MANY OF THE ADS THAT SAY IT'S FREE THAT'S WEEKLY DISCLOSED. AND THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE A FAMILIARITY WITH THE RESIDENTS CONDITION AND THE HOME THEY'RE TRYING TO PLACE THEM IN AND SO THE ONLINE MODEL IF THEY CAN MEET THOSE CONDITIONS WE HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT WHATSOEVER. AND AND I'M. THEY HIT OF THE SUMMER AS. NO OTHER. YES BUT. SO. I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU THAT YOU YOU WITH CARING DOT COM RIGHT. RIGHT AND THEIR REPRESENTATIVES CORRECT ALRIGHT. IN OPPOSITION. CORRECT YOUR ONLINE FOR FREE CORRECT. CORRECT TO THE CONSUMER. HOW DO YOU MAKE YOUR MONEY? WELL WE DISCLOSE THAT ON OUR PAGE OF COURSE WE MAKE MONEY A NUMBER OF WAYS. ONE WAY WE DO MAKE MONEY IS WE DO GET A. SO CALLED COMMISSION FROM THE FACILITIES AND WE DISCLOSE THAT ALREADY IS WHO WE DO AGREE WITH THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN THAT SHOULD BE DISCLOSED. SO YES INDEED WE IN FACT THAT'S HOW THE AGENCY WORKS THERE EITHER PAID BASED ON. THE PERCENTAGE OF FIRST MONTH'S RENT OR THEY'RE PAID FOR QUALIFIED LEADS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER CONTRACT MARKETING AGENCY OPERATES THE SAME MODEL. SO IF YOU DON'T MAKE A PLACEMENT DOES THE. FACILITY REFUND THAT. FREE. WELL IT DEPENDS ON WHAT THE FEE ARRANGEMENT AS ITS SUBJECT BETWEEN NEGOTIATIONS OF THE FACILITY AND THE REFERRAL AGENCY BUT IF THE MODEL IS A PAYMENT FOR A MOVIN AND OF COURSE ONLY IF THERE'S A MOVING DO YOU GET PAID. IF IT'S A PAYMENT FOR QUALIFIED LEAD YOU COULD GET PAID FOR QUALIFIED LATE. IT'S SUBJECT TO NEGOTIATION AND SHOULD NOT BE DICTATED BY LEGISLATION. UNDER APART FROM THE DISCLOSURE THE DISCLOSURES FINE. BUT THE QUESTION IS CAN YOU DICTATE WHAT THE ECONOMICS ARE OF THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTION THAT'S A BRIDGE TOO FAR. THANK YOU SIR. I HAVE TWO MORE QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR. MONNING NOW WERE DONE. YEAH. BY SO OF MAY I OF THE. ABSOLUTELY ARTHUR. MY NEIGHBOR. I SUPPORT THIS BILL CASE SO THESE ARE CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FOR ME AS YOU KNOW I HAVE AN INQUIRING MIND I CAN HELP MY. SO. THIS AUTHORIZES DDS TO LEVY CIVIL PENALTIES ON REFERRAL AGENCIES PURSUANT TO CURRENT LAW REGARDING CIVIL PENALTIES. HOME HOW MUCH COULD THE. THE. THE CIVIL PENALTY BE AND HOW WOULD YOU APPLY IT TO SOMEONE IT'S ONLINE. THAT'S MY QUESTION. IF I MAY HAVE OUR EXPERT RESPOND TO THAT. TWENTY ONE AND ONE. FOR THOSE HOUSES CIVIL FEE DETERMINED AND HOW DO YOU APPLY IT TO. AND AN ONLINE SERVICE SO RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY. HAVE CONTRACTS THEY SIGN WITH REFERRAL AGENCIES AND IT ESTABLISHES THAT THE FEE WHICH IS. TYPICALLY. SOME PERCENTAGE OF THE FIRST MONTH'S RENT. AND IT GOES AS HIGH AS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. I'M SOME REFER ALLEGIANCE. WE'LL LET YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU HAPPEN TO GIVE THEM TWO HUNDRED PERCENT MAYBE THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO SEND THAT REFERRAL TO YOU'D AND SOMEBODY ELSE. WHICH IS A REAL PROBLEM AND IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH FINDING THE RIGHT HOUSE FOR THE ELDERLY. SO ARE AND. AND THERE WAS SOMETHING SAID ABOUT FIRST JAN FIRST IN JUST MEANS SOMEBODY WHO RUSHED OUT TO SEND OUT THE NAME OF THIS PERSON AND THE CONTACT INFORMATION FOR THE PERSON. IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE QUALITY OF SERVICE OR THE VALUE ADDED IT'S GIVEN. AND OFTENTIMES REFERRAL AGENTS WHO ARE IN THE COMMUNITY. ARE SPEND. DAYS AND WEEKS AND SOMETIMES MONTHS WORKING WITH PEOPLE TAKING THEM TO SEE HOMES WITH NO IDEA IT'S SOMEONE ONLINE HAD SENT IN. THE NAME OF THIS PERSON TO THE HOUSE WHERE THEY MAY END UP GOING AND THEN THAT AGENCY SHOWS UP SINGLE YOU UNLESS THE FEE RECENT AT FIRST. AND. IT DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THE PENALTIES MAY BE. HAS THAT BEEN ESTABLISH A NO NO I'M IN AND THERE WAS SOMETHING REFERRED TO A A LAW THAT MAKES. IT IT ILLEGAL FOR REFER ALLEGIANCE TO. TO DO SOMETHING I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT IS THAT THEY'RE ILLEGAL. BUT THIS IS NEVER GOING TO RISE HIGH ENOUGH ON A D. A SWISS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND THAT'S WHY THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANY. ANYTHING REALLY REPORTED THE GRAFT IN THE INDUSTRY ISN'T RISING HIGH ENOUGH FOR DE A TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND THIS BILL. MAKES CODIFIES REQUIREMENTS THAT WILL MAKE IT A PROBLEM AND AND FIND WAYS THAT IT CAN BE ENFORCED. SO DO YOU KNOW WHO AND WHEN CIVIL PENALTIES WILL BE ESTABLISHED. YEAH I'M. I'M I. THAT. THERE ARE THERE ARE NO CIVIL PENALTIES ESTABLISHED IN THIS BILL. BOB BUT IT THERE WAS A THERE WAS. ARM. THEY THE PENALTY IS THAT. THERE ARE REFERRAL AGENT IS REMOVED FROM THE REGISTRY AND THEN IT. MAKES IT ILLEGAL FOR THEM. TO MAKE A REFERRAL NOW YOU'RE ASKING ME WHAT'S THE PENALTY OR IF IT'S ILLEGAL TO MAKE A REFERRAL AND AND. I'M ASSUMING THAT WILL BE ESTABLISHED IN THE FUTURE IS AT A SAFE ASSUMPTION. THE BIGGEST THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS CAN. HAVING THOSE REFERRAL AGENCIES ONCE THAT'S BEEN FOUND THAT THEIR BEHAVIOR. IT IS WRONG. TO THE AT TO HAVE THEM TAKEN OFF THE REGISTRY SO THEY CAN NO LONGER RECOVER A FEED. WHICH IS WHAT HOW THEY MAKE THEIR THEIR BUSINESS ON THE INTENSIVE CURRENT LAW ARE THERE ALREADY IS A SMALL TOWN ESTABLISHING CURRENT LAW TO THE DEPARTMENT WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING HOW THEY GO ABOUT ESTABLISHING A FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROTOCOL. SO SO PENALTIES ALREADY EXIST A IN TERMS OF LICENSING VIOLATIONS AND AND THAT WOULD ALSO. THEN BE EXTENDED FOR THE MORTAR REFERRAL AGENCIES AND THAT WOULD BE OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO THIS BILL. FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO COME UP WITH THE STANDARD. NOW GET NUMBERS TO PROTECT. ZERO. THAT WAS ONE QUESTION BAYSIDE. THIS NUMBER TO KNOW. SO. YOU. DID A STEP WHICH IS WITHIN THE STATE TREASURY OF RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITY REFERRAL AGENCY FUND. INTO WHICH ALL FEES. THE MONEY'S DE. YOU DON'T WILL BE DEPOSITED. HOW DOES THAT WORK? BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN I'M ALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT IF IT WERE PUNISHING SOMEONE AND WHERE THE MONEY GOES I THINK ASSEMBLYMAN AREIAS GAVE YOU THE ANSWER OF THE PUNISHMENT IF THEY'RE TAKEN OFF. THE REGISTRY THEN THEY CANNOT BE COMPENSATED FOR MAKING A REFERRAL. AND SO THE HOMES LIKE MINE KNOWING THAT THEY'RE OFF THE REGISTRY DOESN'T DO WON'T HAVE TO MAKE A PAYMENT. AND IF THEY COME AFTER US THEIR SMALL CLAIMS COURT WILL SETTLE THAT. I GOT IT NOW OKAY THIS LOSER FEE RIGHT. THAT THAT DELUSION THREE RIGHT WITH THAT THAT'S THE PENALTY WHAT'S RIGHT NEAR A PARKING TICKET. IT IS LOSE YOUR FEELINGS OF IT BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT AT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY PERCENT. OF A. OF A FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR A MONTH FEE IS SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS. RIGHT AND SO THAT IT THAT IS NOT INSIGNIFICANT. YOU. CAN SOLVE THE THERE'S AN AYE RECOMMENDATION. THAT I'VE PUT FORWARD AS CHAIR OF A THREE WRITTEN SPECIFICALLY REASONS ONE IS I DO BELIEVE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PERSONAL PROTECTION BUT AS NECESSARY. SECONDLY. IT WAS JUST THIS MATTER THIS BILL WAS JUST HEARD. AND HUMAN SERVICES LAST WEEKEND OF THE CHAIR HUMAN SERVICES HERE WITH US AMHERST AFTER A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK ON A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS. TO DEAL WITH OPPOSITION NOW NOT ALL OF OPPOSITIONS CONCERNS WERE NESTLE MEMBER THINK MOST OF THEM WERE MET BUT THEY'RE STILL MORE WORK TO DO. AND THE THIRD REASON WHY RECOMMENDED I. IS AT THE CHAIR ARE THE SAME MEMBERS COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION ON THOSE SPECIFIC ISSUES OBVIOUSLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT TURN AROUND TIME. FROM HUMAN SERVICES SO SHORT AND THERE IS SO MUCH WORK DONE AT HUMAN SERVICES I THINK IT'S REASONABLE FOR US TO ALLOW THE OPPORTUNITY. IDEA HOW TO HAVE A SUMMARY AS TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION ON THE REMAINING ISSUES THAT UP THAT HUMAN SERVICES AND IN SOME AREAS WERE NOT ABLE TO. OF RECTIFY IT AND YOU KNOW I IN LAST WEEK'S MEETING BUT I THINK A LOT OF WORK WAS DONE I WANT TO RECOGNIZE. THAT YOU'RE RUBIO AT HER STAFF AS WELL THE SONORA REYES FOR THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE. AND I THINK OF THAT SHOWS TO ME THE COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS AYE TO ENSURE THAT THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT EVERYONE SEEMS TO AGREE ARE IMPORTANT INCLUDING OPPOSITION. BUT ON SOME OF THOSE REMAINING POINTS I THINK THERE'S STILL AN OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE FORWARD IN OUR COLLABORATION AND SO WITH THAT I DO RECOMMENDED I. AND SO IT THERE'S. A MOTION IP HAPPENED ENTERTAINMENT CRYING AT THE QUESTIONS THAT MEMBERS HAVE. ALRIGHT AND SO WE HAVE A MOTION OF NO FURTHER COMMENT LAST FOR IS. PRESENT REYES LIKE CLOSE. AB TWO SEVEN FOUR FOUR. REALLY TAKES THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS TRANSPARENCY. AND TODAY I AM. A QUESTION AND I VOTE SO WE CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS.

HER EMAIL FOR THE MAGAZINE GOT HACKED AND IT SET OUT TO. ALL OF THE SUBSCRIBERS OF THE MAGAZINE A MESSAGE THAT SHE WAS STUCK IN MANILA AND NEEDED SOME MONEY TO BE ABLE TO GET. OUT. SO THIS. THIS MESSAGE WENT OUT TO ALL OF THE SYSTEMS DESCRIBERS NOW THIS IS A SENIOR RELATED MAGAZINE IT'S FOR SENIORS ABOUT SENIORS. AND. TWO OF THOSE SUBSCRIBERS EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE THOUSANDS. DID SEE AND MONEY. THINKING THAT MY FRIEND TRACY WAS IN TROUBLE. AND IT WAS REALLY ASHAMED THEY COULDN'T GET THAT MONEY BACK. I HAVE ANOTHER FRIEND WHO'S WHO HAS BEEN IN HER LIFE TIME.

GOOD AFTERNOON TWENTY TICKET TELLING BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM. MIKE MONTGOMERY CONGRESS OF CALIFORNIA SENIORS WE SUPPORT THE BILL. CAROL SO FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON AGING FINANCIAL ABUSE OF THE ELDERLY INDEPENDENT ADULTS IS ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING CRIMES IT'S OF A BIG ISSUE. FOR THE COMMISSION ON AGING AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THIS EFFORT TO EXPAND. VIGILANCE TO TRY AND STOP THIS THINKING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AYE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF MY NAME'S BOB GARCIA I REPRESENT THE MONEY TRANSMITTERS OTHER TOOK OUR TRADE ASSOCIATIONS CALL THE MONEY SERVICES ROUNDTABLE WERE COMPRISED OF THE LARGER MONEY TRANSMITTERS. JUST TO GIVE THE COMMITTEE SOME CONTACTS. THE BATTERY INDUSTRY HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. ACCORDING TO A TWENTY FIFTEEN WORLD BANK STUDY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS WERE TRANSMITTED MADE BY IMMIGRANTS WORKING IN THE USA. TWENTY THREE BILLION TO MEXICO THIRTEEN POINT. FOUR FIVE BILLION TO CHINA TIM POINTED TO INDIA TEN POINT OF TEN TEN BILLION TO THE PHILIPPINES. WHY DO WE SEE THOSE KINDS OF ARGUE? WHICH I THINK INCREASE EVERY YEAR ABOUT FOUR FIVE PERCENT. OF. THIS IS BECAUSE MONEY TRANSMISSION IS A RELIABLE. METHOD THAT IS THE ONLY METHOD THAT MANY IMMIGRANTS TO THE UNITED STATES CAN USE TO GET NAM. MONEY TO THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS AND LOVED WHAT. WE HAVE STRONG ANTI FRAUD MEASURES IF YOU GO ON OUR WEB PAGES THERE PROMINENTLY FEATURED. THE THE OTHER THING. OF AND I SHOULD ADD THAT I REPRESENTED. A AMERICAN EXPRESS WHEN THIS LAW WAS ENACTED IN NINETEEN NINETY HAVE BEEN WORKING OUT EVER SINCE. WE HAVE IT WAS ADDED TO THE LAWN TWENTY ELEVEN A PROVISION THAT ARE MY CLIENT COMPANIES WORK WITH AGENTS TO EDUCATE THEM WE DO THAT. OF. OUR. ON THE RECEIPT FOR. THERE IS UNNOTICED TOOK CALLED THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OF. A OVERSIGHT IF THERE IS A QUESTIONER UNEASE ABOUT A TRANSMISSION. I WANT TO FIVE OR SIX OF LOCATIONS AROUND AROUND OF THE CAPITAL AREA. RIGHT EIGHT I WENT OVER THERE AT LUNCH. RIGHT NEXT TO THE WESTERN UNION SIGN IS THE PLACARD TO CALL THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT IT RIGHT THERE. AND I THINK IT THEY'VE DONE A GREAT JOB OF PUTTING THOSE PLACARDS UP. OF. MY MAIN POINTS OF OPPOSITION I HAVE TO BRING SOETHING OUT BECAUSE I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH A STAFF MEMBER. IT CAME UP IN SOME IN CERTAIN CONVERSATIONS AND I WAS REFERRING TO THE LATINO COMMUNITY. THAT THIS BILL COULD. DISRUPT OR OR. DIMINISHES THEIR WILLINGNESS TO GO TO OF A JOB RETAIL OUTLET LIKE RIGHT EIGHT. IF THE WORD GETS OUT IN THE COMMUNITY THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE CARDING PEOPLE. AND THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT DISCUSSION HOW DO YOU DIVINE THE AGE OF A PERSON. IF YOU'RE THAT RITE AID CLERK ENOUGH TALK TO THE RETURNS RETAILERS ARE TALK HOW DO YOU FIGURE IT OUT. IT'S HARD TO TELL HOW OLD SOMEBODY IS BY THE WAY THEY LOOK. A AND THEN IT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU DO THAT ISSUE CARD PEOPLE. SO OF. THAT WAS NOT IN MY POSITION LETTER BECAUSE IT CAME UP IN A CONVERSATION BY SCALPERS WHO ASKED IF I THOUGHT THAT WAS A POSSIBILITY. I HAVE NO CONCRETE EVIDENCE BUT I IT'S NOT A BIG LEAP IN FAITH. THE MAIN INTO OUTRIGHT A DEBRIEF FEAR THAT. THE BILL IS FLAWED BECAUSE IT MISUNDERSTANDS OUR BUSINESS MODEL. WE WORK THE COMPANY'S WORK WITH A NETWORK OF AGENTS. WE IT WERE HEAVILY REGULATED THAT LIST OF AGENTS IS PROVIDED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT. AND EVERY TIME A NEW AGENT IS ADDED OF DESK INTERIOR CONSIDERED MATERIAL CHANGE WE HAVE TO NOTIFY DEAL BE WITH IN A MONTH. BUT. SO WE HAVE NO. PHYSICAL INTERACTION. IN REAL TIME. WITH A HUMAN BEING. OUR AGENTS DO THAT. THERE'S BEEN A GRAVITATION TWO ONLINE TRANSMISSION THERE'S NO INTERFACE THERE HOW CAN YOU TELL IF THERE'S ELDER ABUSE GOING ON WHEN IT'S IN ALL THE GOOD WE ARE DOING ON THE COMPUTER. THE OTHER THING AND I DO RESPECT. THE THE THE GROUPS ARE SUPPORTING THE BILL. BUT IT DOESN'T IT'S FLAWED IN ITS UNDERSTANDING. THE DATE OF ACTIONS THAT WERE CITED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THE MOST RECENT ONE WAS TWENTY TWELVE. TWENTY TWELVE. AND I I I. I ASKED THAT THE PROPONENTS. CAN THEY PRODUCE ONE COMPLAINT. ONE COMPLAINT. THAT. ELDER ABUSE. OCCURRED AT A RIGHT EIGHT. OR A WESTERN WE'RE WATCHING SERVICES ARE OR ANY OTHER LOCATION. THEY CAN'T PRODUCE ONE COMPLAINT. SO THE BILL TRIES TO FIX A PROBLEM THAT DOESN'T EXIST. IN BUYING PLACING OBLIGATIONS ON OUR AGENT COMMUNITY. IT PUTS HIM IN A HORRIBLE POSITION SO FOR THOSE REASONS I OPPOSE THE BILL. WE OPPOSED TO THANK YOU. THANK YOU SOME OF THE GLORIA DID YOU HAVE A. OKAY BUT ANYONE ELSE OPPOSITION. THAT THAT THAT AND THAT IS WHY IN TERMS OF EQUITY IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF TIME WAS USED. THAT THE PROPONENT WITNESS HAD SO IF YOU JUST WANT TO DO A QUICK A QUICK. THIRTY SECONDS PERHAPS THEY THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MACHINE WILL NEED TO BE HAVE TO CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION. APPRECIATE MISTER CHIU BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I HAD HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH A HIS OFFICE OF ASSUMING THE BILL MOVES HAPPY TO CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND WORKING WITH THEM. I'M HERE JUST QUICKLY ON BEHALF OF WITHIN THE ASSOCIATIONS ARE LARGE A GROCERY STORES. CHAIN DRUGSTORES IT YOU MAY KNOW THAT MAY COME TO MIND. AND I'M HERE REALLY IN BEHALF OF OUR AGENT COMMUNITY THAT WOULD BE IMPLICATED IN THE BILL. AND REALLY JUST AS WE THINK THROUGH THIS THEIR LEVEL OF DISCERNMENT GIVEN THEIR AGE WHERE THEY'RE AT IN LIFE THE TRANSIENT NATURE OF THE JOB. THEIR ABILITY TO DISCERN. WHAT'S GOING ON DURING THAT TRANSACTION WHETHER OR NOT THAT PERSON IS ACTUALLY UNDER ON IN UNDUE INFLUENCE OR DURESS THE BELIEVE* QUESTIONS MATURITY LEVEL ALL THAT AND THEN TO HAVE THE CORRESPONDING PUNISHMENT. IF THEY DON'T AND THEY DON'T GET IT RIGHT SO I'M I'M REALLY HERE TO SPEAK TO THAT ISSUE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT. I'M ANYONE ELSE TO LEAD HIM UP THE MIKE FROM HERE JUST A STATE OPPOSITION. ALRIGHT LET'S BRING ABOUT COMMITTEES ON A GLORIA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU MISTER CHIU FOR A THE BILL IN THE PRESENTATION. OBVIOUSLY ALL OF US ARE AGAINST ELDER ABUSE. YOU KNOW IF YOU WANT TO SCAN MY GRANDMOTHER YOU BETTER LOOK OUT. FOR YOU RIGHT. SO I I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IT'S ALWAYS THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS I THINK YOU SPOKE TO THIS A BIT YOUR TESTIMONY. BUT MAYBE A GLOVE QUESTION WHOSE CORAL GETTING TO THE LAST SPEAKER. THE IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THE READING OF THIS BILL A WOULD. MANDATE RETAIL WORKERS TO BE MANDATED REPORTERS FOR ELDER ABUSE IS THAT THE INTENT OF YOUR BILL. AND I JUST OF ANOTHER YOU KNOW YOU ARE THE THE COMPANY. WHAT THOUGH WENDY DETECTED THERE'S A SUSPICIOUS OPEN? OF FRAUDULENT. AND REPORT IT TO DID THE LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT IT IN ANY EVENT I COULD IF I COULD OF A SUMMER SHE SO OF THE. THE THE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ASSEMBLY CHIU WITHOUT WITH OUR STAFF. ITS. THE AGENTS OR THOSE THAT ARE THE AGENTS OF THOSE THAT ARE. PROVIDING THE SERVICE SO IF THERE'S AN AGENT THAT HAPPENS TO BE IF IT'S INMIGRANTE FOR YOU WE SEE I'VE SEEN IT. THROUGHOUT MY DISTRICT CERTAINLY ENGROSSING STORIES YOU'LL SEE OP TIMES THEIR WINDOWS WHAT HAVE YOU WELL WHOEVER'S DOING THAT SERVICE WAS NOT THAT NECESSARILY EVERYONE THAT WORKS IN THAT GROCERY. STORE EVERYONE THAT WORKS AS AN EMPLOYEE OF THAT TO GO STROBE THOUGH THOSE ARE ACTUALLY PROVIDING THAT SERVICE ARE WORKING AS AGENTS. OF THOSE COMPANIES AND SO DAYS GO THERE WOULD BE THE ONES THAT WOULD FALL UNDER. MY UNDERSTANDING CRACKING AROUND A LITTLE DIBELLA ABOUT REQUIREMENTS. SO IT READING THE. BILL IT'S I THINK THERE MIGHT BE A LOT THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDED TO THAT TO CLARIFY THAT BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING. A LOT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS CAN BE PERFORMED AT THE MAIN REGISTERS. AS IS MENTIONED EVEN ONLINE AND YOU KNOW I. ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND HOW BANKS CAN BE. HELD ACCOUNTABLE YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD MAKE A CHARGE OUTSIDE OF SAN DIEGO SACRAMENTO I GIVEN NOTICE MY BANK RIGHT THEY CAN MONITOR AND SEE THESE KINDS OF TRANSACTIONS THEY HAVE SOME SORT ALGORITHM OR IT PRODUCT THAT ALLOWS THEM TO DO WHAT. I THINK WHAT YOUR INTENT IS TO TRY IN AND ALLOWS WITH WIRE TRANSFER SERVICES STAFF SIMILAR CAPABILITIES AND TO SORT INTERVENE SOMEHOW AND THAT'S DIFFERENT. BEEN EXPECTING A YOU KNOW RELATIVELY YOUNG. MINIMUM WAGE EMPLOYEE THAT MAY HAVE NOT MINIMAL TRAINING IF ANY TRAINING TO DO THIS WORK AND I. WHEN THE WHEN THINKING ABOUT THAT IN THE LIABILITY THAT WOULD ACCRUE EITHER TO THEM BUT TO THE EMPLOYER. AND FROM A LIMITED TRANSACTION YOU KNOW OF A OF A FEW SECONDS TIME BETTER REGISTER. I I WONDER IF THAT'S AT A MINIMUM. FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY OF FOR IF THOSE WHO ADVOCATE FOR THIS BILL. OR AT A MINUTE OR OR CONVERSELY ENOUGH SIGNIFICANT LIABILITY WHEN THERE'S VERY LITTLE EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT SO I IS THERE A WAY TO TIGHTEN THIS UP TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOT. YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO MAYBE SCOOPING ICE CREAM ONE SECOND WORK IN THE REGISTER AND SELLING GROCERIES THE NEXT AND THEN ALSO WORKING THESE KINDS OF TRANSACTIONS ARE WAY TO NARROW THE SCOPE DOWN. GOVERNOR YOU KNOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THAT I THINK IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT. A POINT YOU KNOW WE WE'RE TRYING TO. GO AFTER THOSE. WHO SCAM YOU KNOW ON IS? TO TOUCH. BECAUSE THIS SENIOR WAS KIND OF BEING THERE. BEING TARGETED. SO YOU KNOW IS THIS A SICKNESSES WILL ACQUIT CALLER THE SENIORS CAMPUS REALLY GOING AFTER. DOLE ALTHOUGH SCAMMERS Y. AND AND THE BANK AND DO IT I'M. VERY CONFIDENT THAT THOSE WIRE HAS THROUGH A COMPANY BE ABLE TO DO IT WIDER. AT AT THE COUNTER WHERE THERE'S A HUMAN INTERACTION OR AND IN THE BACK IN OR DO YOU JUST POINTED OUT IN THE AND INTO CORPORATE OFFICE OR. SOME OF THE THUMB. YEAH LOCATIONS SAID DEFINITELY I WOULD ASSUME I AND I DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT THIS BUSINESS IS ALWAYS THE DIFFICULTY OF THE WORK THAT WE DO. ON A MILE WIDE AND STEEP RIGHT. BUT WERE YOU KNOW HOLDING. COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR TRANSACTIONS AND PATTERNS THAT THEY MAY SEE THAT I GET I THINK HOLDING INDIVIDUALS. ACCOUNTABLE FOR A LIMITED INTERACTION THAT THEY MAY HAVE ONLY ONCE IT'S ALL OF THE DIFFERENT. COURSE WE WOULD HOPE EXPECTED PEOPLE TO SPEAK GOOD DECENT HUMAN BEINGS THAT THEY SEE A SENIOR BEING MANIPULATED THAT THEY WOULD SAY SOMETHING A CALL RIGHT. OVERLY WHICH IS CREATING IS AN ONUS FOR THAT EMPLOYEE TO DO SOMETHING AND MY SUSPICION IS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO REALLY NARROWED DOWN TO SOMEONE WHO'S A BIT MORE SPECIALIZED MAYBE HAS A MORE. ON INFORMED. INTERACTION WITH THAT INDIVIDUAL RATHER THAN JUST SORT OF RETAIL EXPERIENCE I THINK ALL OF US WOULD FEEL. AT A DEFICIT AT LEAST YOU KNOW CONCERNED THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO FOR PERFORMED EXPECTATIONS OF US IF WE WERE. DOES NEED A MANDATED REPORTER I'M SO THOSE ARE THE GENERAL CONCERNS I I HEARD YOU SAY YOU COULD TALK A BIT MORE ABOUT THAT OF THE KIND OF MAN THAT YOU LOOKING TO TAKE IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE. ON BECAUSE I RECOGNIZE WE HAVE SOME DEADLINES AND IN THEIR SOME NEEDS IT TO TAKE ACTION BUT WHAT IS IT YOU'RE HOPING TO GO THE NEXT MINUTE THEY'RE DO YOU DO ONE OR HOLDEN FOR THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IS TO CLARIFY. THAT ANY FINE THOSE ARE IMPOSED ON THE COMPANY NOT THE. EMPLOYEES ARE NOT NOT THE CLERK. WILL BE HAPPY TO. OF BROADER DID RANGE OF FIGHTING THE SCAMMERS. UTILIZING THIS BILL I LIKE WE'RE GOING WITH THAT BECAUSE YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE OF OF OF FIND A HUGE FINE TO A MINIMUM WAGE EMPLOYEES IN UNLESS THEY'RE SUPER AWARE OF WHAT THEY'RE UP TO. THEN I I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S THE RIGHT THING BUT I ALSO THINK IT'S ABOUT NARROWING THE SCOPE OF IT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHO'S ACTUALLY HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO THIS. I THINK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE WIRE SERVICES AS OPPOSED TO SOME OF THE RETAILERS I THINK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE FOLKS IN THE BACK INTO REALLY CAN BE MONITORING THIS AS OPPOSED TO SOMEONE. WHO THIS MAY BE ONE OF HUNDREDS OF TRANSACTIONS THEY MAY DO A DAY ON THAT AGAIN ARE NOT OF THE SAME CALIBER OR INTERACTION THAT I MAY HAVE WITH MY BANK TELLER? I'M WITH THE DEALING ONE KIND OF THING ALL DAY LONG THEY SEE ME EVERY NOW AGAIN AND THEY CAN PICK UP THE KIND OF PATTERN THAT I THINK WE'RE EXPECTING PEOPLE TO OBSERVE. AND TAKE ACTION I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOUR INTENT IS THAT'S INTENT I CAN PUBLIC IT WITH THAT. BUT THERE'S GONNA BE SOME OF WHAT I HEAR YOUR COMMITMENT TO DO THAT BUT LIMITED SCOPE WITH REDUCTIONS IN MY ABILITY PARTICULAR AGAIN FOR FRONTLINE WORKERS WHO I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY WOULD NECESSARILY KNOW. AND ONE THING I WOULD SAY OBSERVING AND READING THIS BILL ANOTHER BEEN SIMILAR EFFORTS WITH HOTEL WORKERS TO TRY AND EDUCATE THEM TO SAY OBSERVE HUMAN TRAFFICKING PATTERNS AND TO TRY AND TAKE ACTION. AGAIN IS NOT MAKING THE MANDATED REPORTERS OR MAKING THEM LIABLE BUT IS ABOUT EDUCATING THEM TO WITNESS PATTERNS AND TO TAKE ACTION I THINK THAT'S WHAT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE WHICH IS SOMETHING AND ALSO I WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF. HER AND OF IKE AND I COULD ASSEMBLY GLORIA POEM MUCH OF THE CONVERSATIONS THE LAST COUPLE DAYS OF WHAT SOME WHICH WAS OFFICES BEEN BASED UPON. A FEEDBACK FROM THE SENATE MEMBERS OFFICES. WHEN THEY FIRST HAND OPPORTUNITY LEARN MORE ABOUT THE BILL AND SO SOME OF THE CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS AS ON THE SHOES AGREED TO FIRST OF ALL THAT. ONE OF THE PERSONS REFERRED TO IN REGARDS TO WORK WITH THE BANKERS ASSOCIATION TO GET THEM TO REMOVE DUBBED THE BANKERS OPPOSITION TO IT. A BECAUSE OF THEIR ALREADY THEY ALREADY HAVE THAT OBLIGATION INTO TO NOT MUDDY THE WATERS THERE ARE THEIR ALREADY EXISTING OBLIGATION SEKALI TO REMOVE INDIVIDUAL INDEPENDENT LIABILITY. BUT THIRD ALSO TO TELL TO FOCUS ON IN ON THOSE ARE ACTUALLY DOING THE TRANSACTIONS BECAUSE. OF THE BELIEF IS THIS IS STILL CONSUMER PROTECTION SENIOR PROTECTION BILL IN THE REALITY IS THAT. ON THE ONE HAND YES YOU COULD SAY THAT THESE ARE LIMITED TRANSACTIONS ON THE OTHER HAND AS STATED BY OPPOSITION A HUNDRED AND TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS. A HUNDRED TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY SENDING MONEY FROM A IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES IN A TO OTHER. COUNTRIES THAT AYE AYE GOOD IDEA THAT THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME KIND OF OBLIGATION IN TRAINING BEYOND. THAT THAT DOESN'T PUT THE LIABILITY ON THE INDIVIDUAL BUT. IS NOT TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY WITH BANKERS BUT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER A LOT OF THE TELLERS THAT WORK IN BANKS ALSO. YOU KNOW THERE MIGHT BE COLLEGE STUDENTS AND I BE FOLKS WORKING PART TIME THAT MAY NOT KNOW EVERYONE THAT COMES BEFORE THEM GET THEY HAVE THAT OBLIGATION. AND AND THIS INDUSTRY IS SPECIFIC AND A SPECIFICALLY TARGETS DOES. BECAUSE OF THAT BECAUSE OF THE NEEDS AS INDICATED IN IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES WE DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER OPTIONS A SON THAT MONEY AND SO I'D THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY BASED UPON. CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS AS WELL AS THE BACK OF THESE COMMUNITIES NEED TO BE PROTECTED FROM THE FROM THE ABUSE PARTICULAR WASN'T PARTICULARLY THE SENIORS. THAT'S THAT'S CONSTANTLY OCCURRING AND I KNOW THAT. LOUIS WE DIDN'T IF THERE'S DATA YOU WANT ME WE HAVE DATA WE CAN GET FROM THE APARTMENT TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF FRAUD. THAT OCCURS WITH SENIORS BUT I THINK THAT THIS IS REALLY TRY TO IDENTIFY A VERY NUANCED. FOCUS ON ON ONE ASPECT OF SENIOR FRAUD WHICH IS CHALLENGING TO DO GIVEN THE BUSINESS MODEL BUT I THAT THAT'S A CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD. WE'VE HAD WITH THE AUTHOR OF ALL THE AUTHOR IN HIS OFFICE BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO JUDICIARY KNACKS WHICH I SAID ON. AND SO CERTAINLY SOMEBODY'S CAR BY MEMBERS WOULD BE REQUIRED OF FLOOD OF ME AND. OUR STAFF HERE BUT AS PART OF THIS COMMITTEE TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE DONE BEFORE IT GETS TO JUDICIARY AND I'LL INFORM THE CHARGE ISSUE THAT AS WELL THOUGH OBVIOUSLY KNOW WHAT'S BEEN COMMITTED TO. SERBIA. THOUGH PART THAT I'M STRUGGLING WITH IS I THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THIS IF I'M A YOUNG YOU KNOW. KID WORKING IN THE STORE THAT MAY NOT BE A REPUTABLE BANK AND I AND THE STORE GETS FINED BECAUSE WHO LOSES THEIR JOB. IS THAT THE THE PERSON THAT DATA ARE EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT FINE DIRECTLY. THE THESE COMPANIES THAT WORK ON LOSSES AND THEY MIGHT. YOU KNOW. FIRE THAT. PERSON FOR NOT BEING MORE AWARE AND IF WE DON'T HAVE YOU KNOW KIND OF A MANDATE FOR TRACKING TRAINING OR. BLOOD LET'S FACE IT SOME OF US YOU KNOW THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPERIENCE CAN FEED AS BY A LOT YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PART TIME WORKERS COLLEGE STUDENTS OR SOMEBODY THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE EXPERIENCE. AND THAT'S WHERE MY STRUGGLE IS. AS WELL AS AS. THE THE MANDATE PART OF IT. EVEN THOUGH OF WHEN WE MANDATE. THERE'S A DOZEN. THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM IS THE SCAMMERS IN THESE FIELDS ARE NOT THE SCAMMERS THAT THE SCAMMERS ARE NOT BEING ADDRESSED THE SCAMS JR SCAMMERS ARE STILL OUT THERE IN. AND SO I SEE WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS BUT I DON'T SEE THE PROTECTION AND. IF THE SCAMMERS ARE NOT BEING COCKED. BECAUSE WE HAVE NO ASSURANCES THAT YOU CAN FIND THOSETHE STORES OR WHOEVER IT IS FOR THE TRANSMITTAL BUTTOCK SCAMMERS ARE NOT. BEING CAUGHT AND AT THE END SO THE SCAMMERS STILL GOT THE SCAM AND THEN HERE YOU KNOW WE MIGHT HAVE A SOMEBODY THAT'S LOSING THEIR JOB BECAUSE. OF NOT CATCHING THAT SO THAT'S WHY I'M STRUGGLING WITH THAT AND SO. THIS WILL DEFINITELY TRYING TO% FIRST THE FIRST STEP IS TO REPORT THE CRIME. AND THEN THE HOPEFULLY THE LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD DO DARE THE TO DILIGENT TO CATCH TO SING SCAMMERS. SO THIS ONE WAS JUST RECALL OF A FROM LYING. TO. TO PUT DECIMAL OR REQUIREMENT TO THE BANK TELLER TO THOSE PEOPLE DATA SAID BEHIND IT. WIRED TRANSMITTER. OFFICE. NO BUT WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THE DAYS DUE DO. DOUG D'AMATO YOU KNOW YOU'LL YOU'LL SINGLE AND I AM A MACHINE OR A TELEPHONE. BUT I'M HOPING THAT. THOSE PEOPLE ON THE OTHER END OF THE TELEPHONE ALSO BE TRYING TO IDENTIFY. USER HEY YOU'RE SENDING THIS ONE TO SOME COUNTRIES AND. AFRICA YOU KNOW AND AND YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO. TAKE A LITTLE BIT LOGO MORE RESPONSIBLE HEALTH REPORTING. THOSE TRANSACTIONS. CHAIR I'M SORRY I'M SORRY THERE'S WOULDN'T COULDN'T NO QUESTION POSED. ADDS I'D OPPORTUNITY FOR OF THAT THANK YOU. THAT. IF THERE'S NO OTHER VIABLE QUESTION OR COMMENT RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T I RECOMMENDATION BECAUSE OF THE CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS THAT SOME ISSUES AGREED TO TAKE AS WELL AS THE FURTHER WORK. ON FURTHER FOCUSING AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT LOOK. YES THERE ARE LOT RESPONSIBILITIES ON BANKERS AND TELLERS WHAT HAVE YOU YET THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S FLOWING THROUGH. THIS. THESE COMPANIES ALL IT REQUIRES SOME OBLIGATION AS WELL AND IF THE BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT WHILE THEY JUST GET GROCERY STORES TO HAVE. MAWAE'S WORKERS DOING IT THAT'S DOESN'T REMOVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF. OF TRYING TO IDENTIFY CONDUCT AGAIN JUST IDENTIFYING IT. AND BEING PROPERLY TRAINED AND THE QUESTION THEN GOES TO WELL HOW DO YOU IDENTIFY IT YOU'RE TRAINED HANDS THERE'S GOTTA BE SOME. LEVEL OF TRAINING IN THE MANDATORY REPORTING OBVIOUSLY IS ALWAYS A REASONABLE TEST OF THAT. IF A IF A FRAUD GETS THROUGH A BANK TELLER IT'S ALL EITHER AUTOMATICALLY LIABLE. IT'S THAT DAY THERE'S GOTTA BE A JUDGMENT AS TO WHETHER THEY WOULD TO A REASONABLE BANG TELL WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY. I'M. GLAD THAT YOU CAN GET TO THAT OF THAT BANK TELLER IS NOT PROPERLY TRAINED. THIS GOES TO TRAINING. IN INDUSTRY. OF THE DIED DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME REGULATIONS AND CHECKS THE BANKING INDUSTRY HAS AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY. I AYE RECOMMEND I RECOMMENDATION BECAUSE. IN ADDITION TO THE CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS THAT. THAT HAS EMERGED TO PUT FORWARD TO FURTHER NARROW IT. TO REMOVE INDIVIDUAL LIABILITY AND. TO WORK WITH THE BANKERS TO REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION AS WELL. THIS SHOE OBJECT CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU KNOW PRETTY MUCH OUTSIDE MOVED CONTINUE WORKING. OF WOOD WITH THE. D.. JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBERS YOU FELL. AND ALSO DE. DUE. OF THE BANKERS ASSOCIATION TO CLARIFY. AND TO. FOR SUCH AS HOME AMENDMENTS. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE BOAT. OKAY THANK YOU I'M IS OUR MOTION. JERRY IF WE HADN'T QUESTION COMMENT BUT I WORK YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH WAS HERE I HAVE A COMMENT FOR. CERTAINLY HAVE GOTTEN SOME CALLS MY DISH WITH RESPECT TO THE BILL. AND MY OFFICE TRY TO COMMUNICATE THAT'S TO IN FACT THE AUTHOR WITH RESPECT TO HIS BILL. AND CERTAINLY FOR THE REASONS THAT OF OUR BEING TICKET WE ARTICULATED BY. MS RUBIO. SOME OF MY CONCERNS. I AM. HOPEFUL THAT THOSE AMENDMENTS. WILL IN FACT TO BE PUT FORTH I UNDERSTAND THIS BILL ALSO TO. BE DOUBLE REFERRED TO JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. AND THAT. WHAT I'M HERE FROM THE CHAIR IS A COMMITMENT? ON YOUR PART TO WORK WITH. THE AUTHOR. AS YOU SIT ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. I TRY TO TAKE CONSIDERATION CERTAINLY MR GLORIOSO MR GLORIA'S. COMMENTS. WHICH I THINK ARE ARE VERY TARGETED VERY SPECIFIC AND ALSO MS RUBIO BECAUSE WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT FOR ME. IN AND I'M UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT. A PERSON WHO IN FACT. WORKS FOR A PARTICULAR X. DOUBTLESS MADE EVEN THOUGH THAT PERSON THEMSELVES WOULD NOT BE THE ONE. RECEIVING THE FINAL BE THE COMPANY AND THE COMPANY COULD. OF COURSE MINIMIZE THEIR LIABILITY. BECAUSE THEY'VE JUST RECEIVED A FINE AND THIS PERSON SHOULD BE TRAINED AND NOW THAT PERSON POTENTIALLY COULD BE UNEMPLOYED AS A RESULT OF THAT. BUT I DO THINK THAT AND I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE SPIRIT IN WHICH. THIS BILL WAS BROUGHT FORWARD I DO THINK THAT THERE'S SOME. WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. HERE. AND CERTAINLY AND ENCOURAGE BY AGAIN THE CHAIRS. POSITION HIS COMMENTS TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR. INJURE DASH AND SO I WILL BE DOING A COURTESY I I'LL MAKE A MOTION. I WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT. IS GOING TO MOVE FORWARD IF IN FACT IT'S OUT OF COMMITTEE AND YOUR COMMITMENT TO WORKING ON STRONG STRENGTH IN THIS BILL BECAUSE. AND I RESERVE MY RIGHT ON THE FLOOR GETS A FLOOR TO DO SOMETHING ELSE DIFFERENT. HOW DO A SECOND ON THAT? AND BUT THE COMMITMENT THAT I WILL WORK WITH THE WHEELCHAIR STONE AYE AYE AYE SHARE CONCERNS THAT ARE RAISED HERE AND I THINK THAT THERE IS MORE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. BUT I BELIEVE THAT. BUT THEN THE SINCERITY OF HIS ORIGINAL WORK ON THAT BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT. IF. THERE'S NOT FURTHER FOCUS ON IT THAT IT. OF THE LONG GETTING TO THE FLOOR. MAY VERY WELL NOT MAKE IT TO JUDICIARY IT'S ABOUT SOMETHING I THINK BE WELL ALL BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH SUMMER ISSUE AND WITH CHAIR STONE TO. CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH THAT SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED HERE TODAY. THANK YOU. BUT IT'S UGH GOING TO TAKE A ROLL CALL VOTE THANK YOU. KALRA. AYE KALRA AYE VOEPEL RESPECTFUL NO. VOEPEL NO. ALLEN.

CALPERS THE SOUL ORGANIZATION REPRESENTING SENIORS LIVING IN CC ARE SEIZING CALIFORNIA OUR MISSION IS TO ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND FINANCIAL SECURITY OF CCRC RESIDENTS. AS RESIDENTS WHEN WE MOVED INTO A CCRC WE PAID AN ENTRANCE FEE. WE CONTINUE TO PAY AND ONGOING MONTHLY FEE WHICH IS SUBJECT TO INCREASES AT THE DISCRETION OF OUR PROVIDER. IN ADDITION TO COVERING OPERATING COSTS THESE MONTHLY FEES INCLUDE INCREASES TO HELP COVER THE COST OF MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS AT OUR FACILITIES. AB THIRTY ABA THIS IMPORTANT TO RESIDENTS AS INSURERS THAT OUR PROVIDERS ARE USING RESPONSIBLE PLANNING TOOLS TO MAINTAIN FINANCIAL SOLVENCY AT OUR FACILITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATISTICAL MODELING FINANCIAL RISK ASSESSMENT. THAT IS PROVIDED BY AN ACTUARIAL STUDY OR VALUABLE TOOLS THAT SHOULD BE UTILIZED BY ALL CRC OFFERS. ALL C. C. R. C.'S MAINTAIN INDEPENDENT LIVING ASSISTED LIVING IN SKILLED NURSING UNITS ON CAMPUS. AND THE PROMISE TO ACCOMMODATE THEIR RESIDENTS AS THEY AGE. OUR INHERENT IN ALL CONTRACTS. WITHOUT AN ACTUARIAL STUDY OF CCRC MAY APPEAR FINANCIALLY STABLE IN THE SHORT TERM. YET STILL FACE SIGNIFICANT THREATS TO ITS LONG TERM VIABILITY. JUSTICE ACTUARIAL STUDIES FOCUS ON THE BUSINESS SIDE OF AN OPERATION THERE'S ALSO A NEED TO ATTEND TO THE PHYSICAL PLANT AND EQUIPMENT OF A FACILITY. IGNORING OR DEFERRING MAINTENANCE ISSUES GUARANTEES THAT WHEN FINALLY DISCOVERED THE EVENTUAL REPAIRS WILL ONLY GET MORE SEVERE AND EXPENSIVE AS TIME GOES BY. THEREFORE IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT ALL C. C. R. C.'S REGULARLY OBTAINED A MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR REVIEW OF THESE IMPORTANT BUILDING SYSTEMS. HAVING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED. BY THE LONG TERM PLANNING TOOLS THAT A. B.

IN ALLOCATING RESOURCES TO MEET THOSE NEEDS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME MY URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS MISSION. I THINK IT. THANK YOU COMMUTING AND CONSULTANTS AND MORNING CARVE ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY GROUP ALSO BE HAVE CALCRAFT NOT BE VERY SHORT AND BRIEF I JUST WANT EXPAND ON TWO POINTS MENTIONED IN THE ANALYSIS. FIRST THAT THE STATUTE SILENT ON THE COMPONENTS OF THE ACTUARIAL STUDY REQUIRED FOR THE BELL. WHILE THIS IS TRUE THERE IS A NATIONAL STANDARD OF PRACTICE THAT APPLIES ACTUARIES WHEN PERFORMING PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. INCLUDING GIVING ADVICE THAT SIR SPECIFICALLY I GEARED TOWARDS EASIER SEIZE BOTH FOR A FOR PROFIT AND NONPROFIT. THE STANDARDS ARE SET BY THE ACTUARIAL STANDARDS BOARD AND INCLUDE A RANGE OF FACTORS TO CONSIDER INCLUDING TESTING THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF CCRC. ESTIMATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES EVALUATING FEE STRUCTURES. DEVELOPING POPULATION PROJECTIONS AND MUCH MORE. SECOND IS THAT THE SEIZE EUROPEAN THE A CCRC PROVIDERS ALREADY PROVIDE FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF THAT APARTMENT ON AND WELL BASIS. FOR THE MAJORITY OF CZ R. C.'S ACTUARIAL STUDIES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE CONDUCTED ARE REPORTED TO THE DEPARTMENT. ACTUARIES UNLIKE AUDITED FINANCIAL REPORTS ARE FORWARD THINKING GAUGING THE RISK OF FINANCIAL FUTURE FINANCIAL LIABILITIES. WOULD STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT AND THIRTY EIGHTY. THANK YOU. ANYONE ALSO SUPPORT. YES MY NAME IS BILL SURE ARE I'M A RESIDENT WHOSE CCRC IN DAVIS AND I SUPPORT THOSE. ROBERT SWENSON I AM A RESIDENT OF. CCRC IN DAVIS CALIFORNIA STRONGLY SUPPORT THE BILL. I TONY TO GET THERE WITH CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM IN SUPPORT. MY NAME CANYON M. UNIMPRESSIVE AND SHE'S EVER SEEN DAVIS AND WAS AS CHAIRMAN LOCAL CHAPTER CAL CRAP I SUPPORTED HIM. THEM PRESCOTT WILLIAMS A RESIDENT OF UNIVERSITY RETIREMENT COMMUNITY I SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU ANYWAY IN OPPOSITION MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JET HAMPTON PARA PRISON NEEDS CALIFORNIA. REGRETTABLY IN OPPOSITION TO. AB THREE ZERO EIGHT EIGHT. FIRST I THINK THE OFFERING BOTH FORWARD AND THE COMMITTEE STAFFER. ALL TOWARDS THEY PUT INTO THEIR COMMAND HOUSES ON THIS BILL. YOU KNOW THE TO START BY ESSENTIALLY. MISSION THIS IS YOUR SEATS OFFER SEVERAL DIFFERENT CONTRACT TYPES IN DIFFERENT SERVICES. CURRENTLY IN THE CURRENT STATUTE CAESAR'S YOU ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE AN ACTUARIAL STUDY ON ALL. COMMUNITIES TO PROVIDE TYPE A CONTRACTS TAIPEI CONTRACTS. TYPICALLY REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER INTRINSICALLY THE HIGHER BUT STABLE MONTHLY FEES. BUT UNLIMITED AN ALL INCLUSIVE SERVICES. HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR LIFE. THEY ALSO INCLUDE A VERY IMPORTANT COMPONENT WHICH IS A REALLY TRIGGERS NATURAL STUDY IN ED IS A PROMISSORY NOTE OF CARE. MEAN THAT IF THE INDIVIDUAL. ANY TYPE A CONTRACT WHO. MAY OUT LIVE THEIR ENTRANCE SEEING THEIR RESOURCES THE CCRC STUFF FINANCIALLY OBLIGATED TO CARE FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL FOR LIFE WHETHER AGAIN THEY'VE OUTLIVED THE RESOURCES OR THE CAN NO LONGER MAKE THE MONTHLY FEE. THIS IS WHY TYPICALLY AN ACTUARIAL STUDY IS TRIGGERED FOR THESE TYPE ES CONTRACTS. FOR THE OTHER CONTRACT TYPES TYPE BICU TYPE C. CONTRACTS THERE EITHER MODIFIED OR FEE FOR SERVICE CONTRACT TYPES WERE THE RESIDENT TYPICALLY. IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IT FUNDING THEIR HEALTHCARE NEEDS. SO. WHILE. WE APPRECIATE THE. STATEMENTS THAT THE. THE PROPONENTS ARE MAKING ON THIS BILL. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ACTUARIAL STUDIES PRIMARILY FOCUS ON FUNDING FUTURE HEALTH CARE OBLIGATIONS. AND THOSE ARE NOT PRESENT IN TYPING TYPES HE CONTRACTS. WE ARE CONCERNED THAT REQUIRING SEIZE YOUR SEIZE THAT PROVIDE. THAT DO NOT PROVIDE TYPE A CONTRACTS. TO DO NATURAL STUDY. IS NOT ONLY LESS UNNECESSARY BUT IS ALSO COSTLY. TYPICALLY WHEN THE OPERATIONAL COST OF THE FACILITY GO UP THOSE FEES ARE TO PASS ON THE RESIDENTS SO WE WOULD. WE ARE OPPOSE THE IDEA OF THE CENTURY HAVING A CITY THAT WOULD BE UNNECESSARY PROVIDE NOMINAL OR NO BENEFICIAL INFORMATION. AND POTENTIALLY REYES RESIDENT FEES. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE. SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL INFORMATION THE CCRC PROVIDE ON A YEARLY BASIS AS HE ANNOUNCES POINTS OUT. US YOU SEE OR HEAR REQUIRED TO SUBMIT ANNUAL REPORTS CONSISTING OF AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AND REQUIRED RESERVE CALCULATIONS WITH THE CERTIFIED PUBLIC COUNTS OPINION. ADDITIONAL REVENUE RESERVE INFORMATION. EVIDENCE REALLY BONTA CLICKABLE. FURTHERMORE I IT WAS STATED THAT. ACTUAL CITIES ARE FORWARD THINKING. BUT IT IS REQUIRED TO SEIZE YOUR SEIZE PROVIDES FINANCIAL COMMISSION ON A YEARLY BASIS LOOKING BACK FIVE YEARS. AS WELL AS LOOKING FORWARD FIVE YEARS. SO WE BELIEVE THAT.

MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT A COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO DAMN PRESENTING AB TWENTY TWO TWENTY FOUR WHICH SEEKS TO PROTECT. ELDERLY AND DEPENDENT ADULTS FROM THE UNAUTHORIZED TAKING SHARING OR POSTING OF DEGRADING AND DEHUMANIZING PHOTOGRAPHS OR VIDEOS. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR COMMITTEE STAFF AND THE ADVOCATES AND SUPPORT. AND IN OPPOSITION FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF ARE ON THE AMENDMENTS. TO THIS BILL. THEN YOU OUGHT THEIR AMENDMENTS CLARIFY THAT PUBLIC SHAMING DOES NOT INCLUDE THE TAKING SHARING OR POSTING OF AN IMAGE OF AN ELDER OR DEPENDENT ADULT FOR CLINICAL SAFETY LEGAL OR REPORTING PURPOSES. THAT ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL HIPAA REGULATIONS. THIS BILL COMES AS A RESULT OF NUMEROUS CASES SOME WITHIN MY OWN DISTRICT IN WHICH INDIVIDUALS AND TRUSTED TO TAKE CARE OF THESE VULNERABLE ADULTS HAVE GROSSLY TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE ROLE AS CARE GIVERS. I JUST LIKE I'D JUST LIKE MANY OF YOU DID HERE TODAY WAS SHOCKED TO LEARN HOW PEOPLE WHO COMMIT AND WITNESS THESE APPALLING ACTS OF ABUSE CAN THEN WALK AWAY WITH LITTLE OR NOT AT ALL LEGAL REPERCUSSIONS. AS OUR SENIOR POPULATION GROWS DRASTICALLY AND OUR SOCIAL MEDIA KEEPS EXPANDING OUT WE HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION TO PROTECT THESE VULNERABLE ADULTS INVEST AS BEST AS WE CAN. HERE WITH ME TODAY IS OUR SPONSOR LISA COLEMAN WITH THE QUOTE LA CALIFORNIA LONG TERM CARE OB. I CAN NEVER SAY THAT WORD. ON THE ARMY PEOPLE AYE ASSOCIATION AND RACHEL TATE. WITH THE WIFE AND HEALTHY EATING COALITION WHO SHARE OUR HERE TO SHARE SOME EXAMPLES OF SOCIAL SEEMING. GOOD AFTERNOON LISA COLEMAN WITH CALCUTTA CALIFORNIA LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN ASSOCIATION ON LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN SO THE ADVOCATES IN LICENSE LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES AND SKILLED NURSING ASSISTED LIVING. AND THEY ARE THE EYES AND THE EARS FOR. RESIDENTS IN THE FAMILIES LAST YEAR IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN A LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN SPUR OF THE MOMENT UP PROVIDED OVER SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND CONSULTATIONS TO INDIVIDUALS. THEY MADE MORE THAN SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND VISITS IN LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES THEY INVESTIGATED AND RESOLVED FORTY TWO THOUSAND COMPLAINT INVESTIGATIONS. AND IT IT ALARMS ME THAT IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS THE COMPLAINT INVESTIGATIONS REGARDING ELDER ABUSE BECAUSE CALIFORNIA HAS A KIND OF A UNIQUE SITUATION AND THAT THE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN. IS THE INITIAL RESPONDER TO ELDER ABUSE COMPLAINTS. THAT IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS THE COMPLAINTS WITH THE CATEGORY OF ELDER ABUSE HAVE INCREASED FROM TEN PERCENT TO TWENTY TWO PERCENT. TWENTY TWO PERCENT OF THE FORTY TWO THOUSAND COMPLAINTS CAME UNDER THE CODE OF ELDER ABUSE. NOW THIS ISN'T JUST A CALIFORNIA PROBLEM THIS IS A NATIONAL PROBLEM. AND TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE CENTER FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID RECOGNIZE THAT MENTAL SUFFERING MENTAL ABUSE IS WHAT'S OCCURRING WIN EIGHT BIT WHEN AN IMAGE IS CAPTURED. AND IT IS PLACED IN A SOCIAL MEDIA FOR THE HUMILIATION OF THE PRESIDENT OR THE ELDER ADULT. AND SO WHILE THIS IS HAPPENING AS AS A FEDERAL MANDATE IN REGULATORY. ARE CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE HAS NOT KEPT PACE WITH THE CHANGE IN TECHNOLOGY AND THE EASE AT WHICH ARE IMAGES CAN KEEP CAN BE CAPTURED. SO WE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR OF. WHEN THE OMBUDSMAN GAME AND SAID THIS IS IMPORTANT SHE RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE IN FACT YOUR EYES AND EARS. AND. SO TODAY TO GIVE YOU EXAMPLES OF WHY THIS IS REALLY IS HAPPENING I TURN OVER TO OUR RACHEL TATE WAS A FIELD ON THE. I THINK THE GRABBING ME AND MY NAME IS RACHEL TATUM A REGIONAL DIRECTOR WITH THE WISE AND HEALTHY AGING LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM. SERVING OVER SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND RESIDENTS IN LONG TERM CARE IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. AND LAST YEAR WE INVESTIGATED OVER TWELVE THOUSAND CASES INVOLVING QUALITY OF LIFE AND QUALITY OF CARE CONCERNS FOR RESIDENTS IN LONG TERM CARE SETTINGS. WE'RE SEEING AN INCREASE IN CASES WHERE FACILITIES STAFF MEMBERS PHOTOGRAPH AND VIDEOTAPE RESIDENTS WHO CLEARLY LACK THE CAPACITY TO CONSENT TO SUCH ACTIONS. THESE PHOTOGRAPHS AND VIDEOS ARE OFTEN USED TO MOCK RESIDENTS WHO NEED ASSISTANCE WITH TOILETING OR OTHER PERSONAL CARE NEEDS. IN SOME CASES LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS TOLD THE OMBUDSMAN THIS IS A CIVIL MATTER AND THEY WON'T TAKE A REPORT OR SEND ANYBODY TO INVESTIGATE. OUR OFFICE RECEIVED A REPORT OF A CAREGIVER TAKING A VIDEO OF A NAKED OLDER GENTLEMEN ON THE TOILET CRYING. THE CAREGIVER COULD BE HEARD LAUGHING AT THE RESIDENT IN THE VIDEO. THE VIDEO WAS TRANSMITTED VIA SOCIAL MEDIA TO THE CAREGIVERS FRIENDS. ONE OF THE FRIENDS DECIDED TO REPORT THE INCIDENT TO THE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM AND THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT DECLINED TO RESPOND TO THE LOCATION OR TO TAKE A REPORT STATING NO ABUSE OF THE OLDER ADULT HAD OCCURRED. IN ANOTHER RECENT CASE OUR OFFICE RECEIVED A REPORT OF A VIDEO BEING TAKEN BY CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANT DURING CARE IN A NURSING HOME. TO SEE AN AIDS WERE PRESIDENT CNA ONE TOOK THE VIDEO OF A NAKED MALE RESIDENT DURING CARE AND THE VIDEO WAS POSTED TO FACEBOOK. SEE AN EIGHT TO WATCHED BUT DID NOT REPORT THIS TO ANYONE. LAW ENFORCEMENT DID RESPOND TO THIS CASE AND THE SEA IN A PROTECT TOOK THE VIDEO PLAYED OUT TO MISDEMEANOR INVASION OF PRIVACY. THE CNA WHO OBSERVE THE VIDEO BEING TAKEN WAS NOT GUILTY A FAILURE TO REPORT ELDER ABUSE BECAUSE THE LAW DOES NOT SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE THIS OF ELDER ABUSE. THIS BILL IF PASSED WOULD MAKE THIS CRIME CLEAR. VIOLATING AN ELDER DEPENDENT ADULTS RIGHTS THROUGH CAPTURING THEIR IMAGE AND OR DISSEMINATING ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS A CRIME AND THE LAW SHOULD BE CLEAR THAT THIS ACTIVITY DEFINITIVELY CONSTITUTES ELDER ABUSE. THEIR EMPLOYMENT TERMINATED DUE TO THESE REPREHENSIBLE CASES THERE IS NOTHING STOPPING THEM FROM MOVING ON TO ANOTHER FACILITY AND DOING IT YET AGAIN. INDIVIDUALS WITH DEMENTIA AND OTHER COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS CAN BE EXTREMELY SUSCEPTIBLE TO ABUSE FOR PREDATORY CAREGIVERS. OUR LAWS FOR PROTECTING THIS VULNERABLE POPULATION HAVE NOT KEPT PACE WITH OUR TECHNOLOGY. AND WITH THIS COMMITTEE SUPPORT THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION YOU CAN CHANGE LESS. THANK YOU. A ANYONE ELSE'S SUPPORT. OUR STATE OMBUDSMAN JOE RODRIGUEZ HAD TO LEAVE EARLY BUT HE'S ONE OF HIS RIP US APART ON THE RECORD. THANK YOU.

THE HORRIBLE PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE HAD IN WILD FIRES WITH PEOPLE BEING LEFT BEHIND IN SOUTH NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO WITH PEOPLE IN THIS CARE FACILITIES IT'S A COMMON SENSE BILL AND I. URGE MY VOTE. LOOKING AT MY NAME IS LAURIE FURRY SENTIMENT ATTORNEY WITH HANDSOME BRIDGE AND I REPRESENT RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY AROUND THE STATE. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSISTED LIVING ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTY NINETY EIGHT. THIS IS A STRAIGHTFORWARD BELL THAT MAKE SURE ALL STAFF OF RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY ARE TRAINED ON EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PLAN. THAT THROUGH QUARTERLY DRILLS UNDER VARIED CIRCUMSTANCES THE STAFF PRACTICE EXECUTION OF THE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PLANS AND THE PLANS ARE REVIEWED EACH YEAR. RECENT AMENDMENTS GO EVEN FURTHER TO REQUIRE CERTAIN PROVISIONS IN THE PLANS. FOR EXAMPLE REQUIRING AVAILABILITY OF CERTAIN EMERGENCY CONTACT INFORMATION TO IDENTIFIED EVACUATION SITES INCLUDING ONE OUTSIDE OF THE IMMEDIATE AREA. RESIDENT INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO STAFF AND UP AVAILABILITY APPROPRIATE SUPPLIES IF SHELTERING IN PLACE. THE BILL APPROPRIATELY REFRAINS FROM BEING TOO PRESCRIPTIVE AS TO THE DETAILS OF THE PLANS. RATHER THE BILL SPECIFIES THE ISSUES THAT EACH PLAN MUST. ADDRESS HUNDREDS OF RCA FEES AND THOUSANDS OF SEEING SENIORS WERE SAFELY EVACUATED DURING THE STATE'S RECENT WILD FIRES. AND LEARNING FROM AND BUILDING UPON THE RECENT SUCCESSFUL RESPONSE TO UNPRECEDENTED EMERGENCY CONDITIONS. PASSAGE OF THIS BILL WILL HELP RCF FEES AND THEIR STAFF TO BE EVEN MORE PREPARED FOR EMERGENCIES IN THE FUTURE. SO I THANK YOU AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND IRISH I'VE.
