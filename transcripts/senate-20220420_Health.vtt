EXCELLENT YOU KNOW FOR CRUNCHING

00:29:39.377 --> 00:29:41.679
OR COLITIS BASED DRUGS ON THIS

00:29:41.746 --> 00:29:43.781
THIS BILL DOES NOT SPECIFY WHICH

00:29:43.848 --> 00:29:45.950
DRUGS WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THIS

00:29:46.017 --> 00:29:47.519
NEW YEAR REQUIREMENT OR LACK OF

00:29:47.585 --> 00:29:48.987
UTILIZATION REVIEW. OR

00:29:49.053 --> 00:29:51.189
UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT SO I

00:29:51.256 --> 00:29:52.323
THINK THAT THAT'S ONE OF OUR

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:54.159
PRIMARY CONCERNS IS THAT THE WAY

00:29:54.225 --> 00:29:56.327
THAT WE READ THE BILL IS THAT

00:29:56.394 --> 00:29:58.830
THAT THIS CAN BE OPEN TO IT TO

00:29:58.897 --> 00:29:59.430
ESSENTIALLY ANY AND ALL DRUGS

00:29:59.497 --> 00:30:00.098
ARE PRESCRIBED. BY DOCTORS TODAY

00:30:00.165 --> 00:30:01.900
BUT SO ARE YOU IMPLYING THAT

00:30:01.966 --> 00:30:04.435
THIS YOU HAVE A CONCERN WITH SAY

00:30:04.502 --> 00:30:06.571
OPIOID PRESCRIPTIONS OR IS THERE

00:30:06.638 --> 00:30:08.373
SOMETHING ELSE WHAT IS YOUR

00:30:08.439 --> 00:30:09.574
SPECIFIC CONCERNS. YEAH I THINK

00:30:09.641 --> 00:30:11.476
GENERALLY SPEAKING THAT COULD BE

00:30:11.543 --> 00:30:12.410
A CONCERN I THINK GENERALLY

00:30:12.477 --> 00:30:13.311
SPEAKING WHEN WE'RE WE'RE

00:30:13.378 --> 00:30:14.112
LOOKING AT THE BILL WE'RE

00:30:14.179 --> 00:30:16.181
LOOKING AT THAT THE BILL SENATE

00:30:16.247 --> 00:30:17.615
THERE IS NO- ABILITY TO LIMIT

00:30:17.682 --> 00:30:19.517
THE DOSAGE OF THE DRUG IN

00:30:19.584 --> 00:30:20.518
PARTICULAR. AND THE FACT THAT

00:30:20.585 --> 00:30:22.420
THE BILL DOES NOT SPECIFICALLY

00:30:22.487 --> 00:30:24.455
LIMIT WHICH DRUGS ARE OR NOT

00:30:24.522 --> 00:30:26.591
APPLICABLE TO THE BILL- WE SEE

00:30:26.658 --> 00:30:28.259
THAT AS BEING KIND OF WIDE OPEN

00:30:28.326 --> 00:30:29.994
SO IT COULD BE SOMETHING LIKE

00:30:30.061 --> 00:30:31.629
OPIOIDS WHICH COULD. POTENTIALLY

00:30:31.696 --> 00:30:32.497
BE AN ISSUE THAT THAT WERE

00:30:32.564 --> 00:30:34.065
PRESCRIBED- IT COULD BE OTHER

00:30:34.132 --> 00:30:36.267
DRUGS- IF WE DON'T HAVE THE

00:30:36.334 --> 00:30:37.235
ABILITY TO DO A CLINICAL RADIO

00:30:37.302 --> 00:30:40.138
AND LOOK AT THE CLINICAL

00:30:40.205 --> 00:30:41.706
PROPRIOCEPTIVE DOSAGE OF THE

00:30:41.773 --> 00:30:43.074
DRUG IN PARTICULAR- YOU KNOW WE

00:30:43.141 --> 00:30:44.509
FEEL THAT THAT. PATIENT SAFETY

00:30:44.576 --> 00:30:46.377
CONCERNS COULD ARISE FROM FROM

00:30:46.444 --> 00:30:52.116
THAT OKAY SO. THEN ON THAT NOTE-

00:30:52.183 --> 00:30:53.418
YOU KNOW THEY- A REAL. BETWEEN

00:30:53.484 --> 00:30:55.320
PATIENT AND THE DOCTOR AND THE

00:30:55.386 --> 00:30:56.321
PATIENT. IN THE ENSURING THE

00:30:56.387 --> 00:30:59.857
DOCTOR BY. UNITY DO YOU THINK

00:30:59.924 --> 00:31:04.829
THAT THE DOCTOR. MIGHT HAVE- A

00:31:04.896 --> 00:31:06.764
BETTER INDICATION OF WHAT'S BEST

00:31:06.831 --> 00:31:09.000
FOR HIS REPORT HER PATIENT MORE

00:31:09.067 --> 00:31:10.501
SO THAN SAY AN INSURANCE PLAN

00:31:10.568 --> 00:31:11.970
WOULD. YEAH I THINK GENERALLY

00:31:12.036 --> 00:31:13.204
SPEAKING YOU KNOW PROVIDERS

00:31:13.271 --> 00:31:16.374
PLANS- INDIVIDUAL WORK TOGETHER-

00:31:16.441 --> 00:31:17.709

00:31:17.775 --> 00:31:19.544
YOU KNOW- COMING UP CLINICALLY

00:31:19.611 --> 00:31:21.179

TRUST AND WORK THESE PROVIDERS

00:31:26.484 --> 00:31:28.086
ON ON ON A- CLOSELY RELATED

00:31:28.152 --> 00:31:30.021
BASIS. YOU KNOW I THINK OUR

00:31:30.088 --> 00:31:31.222
GENERAL CONCERN IS RUNNING

00:31:31.289 --> 00:31:31.956
AROUND THE UTILIZATION

00:31:32.023 --> 00:31:33.057
MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS THAT WE

00:31:33.124 --> 00:31:34.892
TYPICALLY USE THAT ARE IN PLACE

00:31:34.959 --> 00:31:37.729
CURRENTLY- YOU KNOW WE ARE

00:31:37.795 --> 00:31:39.130
CONCERNED THAT THAT THIS BILL

00:31:39.197 --> 00:31:41.332
WOULD DISMANTLE THAT PROCESS A

00:31:41.399 --> 00:31:42.934
CENTRALLY AND SO WE WOULD HAVE

00:31:43.001 --> 00:31:45.937
NO ABILITY AS- YOU KNOW. ACTING

00:31:46.004 --> 00:31:48.206
IN OVERSIGHT POSITION TO LOOK

00:31:48.273 --> 00:31:50.608
FOR REVIEW ANY OF THE CLINICAL

00:31:50.675 --> 00:31:51.776
COMPLETE APPROPRIATE. POTENTIAL

00:31:51.843 --> 00:31:52.577
USES ARE TREATMENTS FOR THESE

00:31:52.644 --> 00:31:54.345
DRUGS SO THAT'S GENERALLY AROUND

00:31:54.412 --> 00:31:55.346
THAT PROCESS WHERE WE ARE

00:31:55.413 --> 00:31:56.848
CONCERNED WE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE

00:31:56.914 --> 00:31:57.915
THAT WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS

00:31:57.982 --> 00:32:00.118
PROVIDERS YOU KNOW BUT THE

00:32:00.184 --> 00:32:00.952
NETWORKING CONTRACTED PROVIDERS

00:32:01.019 --> 00:32:02.620
ARE OBVIOUSLY A VERY IMPORTANT

00:32:02.687 --> 00:32:03.554
PART OF THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY

00:32:03.621 --> 00:32:05.356
SYSTEM- BUT I THINK THESE

00:32:05.423 --> 00:32:07.492
PROCESSES- YOU KNOW ARE IN PLACE

00:32:07.558 --> 00:32:09.794
FOR A REASON- AND THAT'S

00:32:09.861 --> 00:32:11.562
GENERALLY WHITE WE HAVE- OKAY

00:32:11.629 --> 00:32:13.231
SIR THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE

00:32:13.298 --> 00:32:19.270
THAT- I. THE THIS IS ALWAYS A

00:32:19.337 --> 00:32:21.239
TOUGH ISSUE YOU KNOW BECAUSE

00:32:21.306 --> 00:32:22.540
OBVIOUSLY COSTS ARE A CONCERN

00:32:22.607 --> 00:32:24.609
AND IF COSTS ARE GOING TO

00:32:24.676 --> 00:32:27.345
INCREASE FOR THE OTHER- AB PLAN

00:32:27.412 --> 00:32:29.747
HOLDERS THEN YOU KNOW THAT

00:32:29.814 --> 00:32:32.283
CAUSES PROBLEMS FOR PEOPLE. BUT

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:34.385
THEN WE HAVE TO GO TO THE

00:32:34.452 --> 00:32:35.620
REALITY OF THE SITUATION WHICH

00:32:35.687 --> 00:32:36.821
IS WHAT YOU WERE DESCRIBING A

00:32:36.888 --> 00:32:38.756
PEOPLE HAVING A CHRONIC ILLNESS

00:32:38.823 --> 00:32:40.291
FOR WHICH THEY NEED IN THEIR

00:32:40.358 --> 00:32:41.759
PARTICULAR PRESCRIPTION AND THEN

00:32:41.826 --> 00:32:43.594
RUNNING INTO ISSUES WITH THEIR

00:32:43.661 --> 00:32:45.296
INSURANCE PLAN SAYING WE DON'T

00:32:45.363 --> 00:32:46.931
NEED THAT ANYMORE AND WHILE I

00:32:46.998 --> 00:32:49.200
CERTAINLY. APPRECIATE AND

00:32:49.267 --> 00:32:52.437
RESPECT THE CONCERN THAT PERHAPS

00:32:52.503 --> 00:32:53.971
YOU KNOW SOME OPIOID ADDICTION

00:32:54.038 --> 00:32:56.941
MIGHT BE COMING INTO PLAY HERE

00:32:57.008 --> 00:32:58.476
WITH OTHER MEDICATIONS I JUST. I

00:32:58.543 --> 00:33:01.112
DON'T THINK THAT'S THE EMPHASIS

00:33:01.179 --> 00:33:03.981
OF THE BILL AND I THINK IT'S-

00:33:04.048 --> 00:33:08.486
IT'S TERRIBLY. CRUEL TO TELL

00:33:08.553 --> 00:33:10.822
SOMEONE THAT THE MEDICINE THAT

00:33:10.888 --> 00:33:13.358
HAS BEEN WORKING FOR YOU- AND

00:33:13.424 --> 00:33:14.425
THAT YOU HAVE DISCUSSED WITH

00:33:14.492 --> 00:33:16.260
YOUR PHYSICIAN IN YOUR POSITION

00:33:16.327 --> 00:33:17.895
IS MADE THE DETERMINATION THAT

00:33:17.962 --> 00:33:19.597
THIS IS THE BEST THING FOR YOU

00:33:19.664 --> 00:33:21.399
BUT THEN AN INSURANCE PLAN STEPS

00:33:21.466 --> 00:33:23.101
IN AND SAYS WELL WE DON'T THINK

00:33:23.167 --> 00:33:24.502
SO WHEN THEY'VE NOT GONE TO

00:33:24.569 --> 00:33:25.937
MEDICAL SCHOOL ALTHOUGH THEY

00:33:26.003 --> 00:33:27.138
HAVE COLLECTED THE DATA. AND I

00:33:27.205 --> 00:33:28.339
DO HAVE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

00:33:28.406 --> 00:33:30.541
RESPECT FOR THE WORK THAT GOES

00:33:30.608 --> 00:33:32.210
INTO THAT BUT THE REALITY IS THE

00:33:32.276 --> 00:33:33.478
PHYSICIAN IS KNOWS THEIR PATIENT

00:33:33.544 --> 00:33:35.580
IS SAT WITH THEM IN THE ROOM AND

00:33:35.646 --> 00:33:38.049
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON AND I

00:33:38.116 --> 00:33:39.884
THINK THAT'S THE FOCUS OF THIS

00:33:39.951 --> 00:33:42.687
BILL- SO THANK YOU FOR ASKING MY

00:33:42.754 --> 00:33:46.224

COLLEAGUE FROM HAS CAN DO- SO

00:33:58.169 --> 00:34:00.071
THIS BILL OF THE WAY I READ IT

00:34:00.138 --> 00:34:02.206
AND PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M

00:34:02.273 --> 00:34:03.674
WRONG THE AUTHOR'S INTENT IS

00:34:03.741 --> 00:34:04.242
DIFFERENT IT'S- CURRENTLY.

00:34:04.308 --> 00:34:05.543
INDIVIDUALS CURRENTLY ON

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:08.946
MEDICATION. M. FOR ANY TYPE OF

00:34:09.013 --> 00:34:10.548
SPECIFIC DISEASE. AND THEN

00:34:10.615 --> 00:34:12.450
SOMETHING COMES UP AND THERE'S A

00:34:12.517 --> 00:34:14.118
REVIEW AND- YOU JUST WANT TO BE

00:34:14.185 --> 00:34:16.154
ABLE THIS BILL WANTS TO BE ABLE

00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:18.022
TO JUST ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE

00:34:18.089 --> 00:34:19.323
THE MEDICATION THEY'VE BEEN ON.

00:34:19.390 --> 00:34:23.294
DURING THE REVIEW PROCESS. TWO

00:34:23.361 --> 00:34:26.731
CAN. THE MEDICATION OR IF THE

00:34:26.798 --> 00:34:27.398
DOCTOR DETERMINES THAT A

00:34:27.465 --> 00:34:30.802
DIFFERENT DOSAGE OR DOSAGE FORM.

00:34:30.868 --> 00:34:32.904
IS REQUIRED LIKE IF THEY WERE-

00:34:32.970 --> 00:34:34.739
IF IT IF IT DOESN'T MAKE UP

00:34:34.806 --> 00:34:36.207
MEDICAID AND THAT THERE. HAVE TO

00:34:36.274 --> 00:34:38.509
USE VIA A PATCH AND THEN IT

00:34:38.576 --> 00:34:40.545
COMES OUT. AS AN INJECTABLE AND

00:34:40.611 --> 00:34:41.712
THE DOCTOR DETERMINES THAT THE

00:34:41.779 --> 00:34:43.314
INJECTABLE IS GOING TO BE MUCH

00:34:43.381 --> 00:34:45.683
MORE EFFECTIVE. THAN THE PATCH

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:48.519
FROM THE DOG BEN IS SWITCHING

00:34:48.586 --> 00:34:50.555
BUT IT'S THE SAME DRUG- OR LET

WAS GOING TO DO THIS TODAY-

00:34:54.225 --> 00:34:55.226
BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE TO

00:34:55.293 --> 00:34:56.093
PERSONALIZE THESE THINGS BUT I

00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:57.528
MAKE AN EXCEPTION. BECAUSE OF

00:34:57.595 --> 00:34:59.597
VERONICA BLANCATO COULD TELL HER

00:34:59.664 --> 00:35:01.132

00:35:27.458 --> 00:35:29.293
INTENSE OF DOMINO PAIN THAT I

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.762
COULD EVEN IMAGINE- AND I WAS

00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:33.064

NUMBER OF PEOPLE. LARA EIGHT

00:36:12.103 --> 00:36:13.804

AND YOU HAVE TO DO IT EVERY FOUR

00:36:15.506 --> 00:36:17.041

00:37:14.432 --> 00:37:16.000
MAKES EITHER AN ADJUSTMENT OR

00:37:16.067 --> 00:37:17.902
SWITCHING THE MEDICATION. I'M IT

00:37:17.969 --> 00:37:20.938

AS POSSIBLE- BUT YET THAT'S

00:37:41.726 --> 00:37:43.160
GENERALLY THE CASE. AND I KNOW

00:37:43.227 --> 00:37:44.462
IT WAS THE GENTLEMAN FROM THE

00:37:44.528 --> 00:37:45.963
CHAMBER HE MADE THE COST

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:48.833
ESTIMATES I BELIEVE- 22%

00:37:48.899 --> 00:37:50.768
INCREASE TWENTY SEVEN MILLION

00:37:50.835 --> 00:37:52.470

00:37:52.536 --> 00:37:54.038
COST INCREASE. I MEAN NEED

THAT I'M CURRENTLY ON IN MY

00:39:01.272 --> 00:39:02.606
MEDICAL PROVIDER SAYS YOU NEED

DOCTOR SAYS I HAVE TO HAVE THIS.

00:39:24.428 --> 00:39:25.129
INJECTABLE NOW BECAUSE IT'S

STILL NOT AFFECTING ME AM I

00:39:27.098 --> 00:39:28.099
WOULD THINK THAT YOU GUYS WOULD

00:39:28.165 --> 00:39:29.834
BE JUST AS EXPEDIENT IN

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:32.236
APPROVING. THE MEDICAL PROVIDERS

00:39:32.303 --> 00:39:34.772
REQUEST IS THAT TRUE YES YES

00:39:34.839 --> 00:39:35.740
GENERALLY SPEAKING AFTER THE

00:39:35.806 --> 00:39:37.308
AMONG THESE OBVIOUSLY WITH WHEN

00:39:37.374 --> 00:39:38.676
IT COMES TO PRESCRIPTION DRUGS

00:39:38.743 --> 00:39:40.077
SPECIALLY IF IT'S THERE I'M

00:39:40.144 --> 00:39:41.579
TREATING YOU KNOW CHRONIC.

00:39:41.645 --> 00:39:43.147
RESEARCH CONDITIONS- HEALTH

00:39:43.214 --> 00:39:44.782
CENTER ARE YOU KNOW WE PROCESS

00:39:44.849 --> 00:39:49.386
THOSE AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN. I

00:39:49.453 --> 00:39:50.855
GET PERSONAL STORIES LIKE HIS

00:39:50.921 --> 00:39:52.857
AND AGAIN LATER THAT LADY THAT

00:39:52.923 --> 00:39:53.691
TESTIFIED. AND IT'S NOT

00:39:53.758 --> 00:39:55.126
SOMETHING THAT YOU GUYS DELAY

00:39:55.192 --> 00:39:57.595
FOR A LENGTHY PROCESS YOU GUYS

00:39:57.661 --> 00:39:59.797
IMMEDIATELY EXPECT THIS YES GEN

00:39:59.864 --> 00:40:01.232
MOST CASES GENERALLY SPEAKING

00:40:01.298 --> 00:40:02.967
GENERALLY SPEAKING YES OKAY. SO

00:40:03.033 --> 00:40:04.335
IF YOU DO THAT I'M KIND OF

00:40:04.401 --> 00:40:06.537
CURIOUS AND AGAIN I'M JUST GONNA

00:40:06.604 --> 00:40:07.304
MAKE THE STATEMENT OF A YES

00:40:07.371 --> 00:40:09.073
ANSWER IT IF YOU HAVE

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:09.640
UTILIZATION REVIEW ALREADY

00:40:09.707 --> 00:40:12.576
AVAILABLE YOU DO IT AN EXPEDITED

00:40:12.643 --> 00:40:15.913
PROCESS- I DON'T SEE WHERE THE

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:17.381
COST FACTOR COMES IT SEEMS LIKE

00:40:17.448 --> 00:40:19.116
YOU'RE TAKING A WHOLE LIKE

00:40:19.183 --> 00:40:20.050
EVERYBODY'S GONNA BE REQUESTING

00:40:20.117 --> 00:40:21.685
AND THAT CHANGING MEDICATION-

00:40:21.752 --> 00:40:23.154
EVERYBODY'S GONNA BE REQUESTING

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:24.255
THE MOST EXPENSIVE MEDICATION

00:40:24.321 --> 00:40:26.023
BUT IT'S TRULY NOT THOUGH IT'S

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:27.591
JUST WHAT THE MEDICAL PROVIDER

00:40:27.658 --> 00:40:29.026
PROVIDES WRITE THAT PRESCRIPTION

00:40:29.093 --> 00:40:30.995
YEAH I THINK IN TERMS OF THE

00:40:31.061 --> 00:40:31.962
COST ESTIMATES CENTER I THINK-

00:40:32.029 --> 00:40:33.697
YOU KNOW YOU THE NUMBERS WE WERE

00:40:33.764 --> 00:40:35.599
CITING OR FROM THE CALIFORNIA

00:40:35.666 --> 00:40:36.267
HEALTH BENEFITS REVIEW PROGRAM.

00:40:36.333 --> 00:40:37.768
AND THEIR ESTIMATES WERE BASED

00:40:37.835 --> 00:40:39.236
ON GREATER UTILIZATION OF THE

00:40:39.303 --> 00:40:41.172
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AS WELL AS

00:40:41.238 --> 00:40:44.175
OTHER POTENTIAL OFF TED TO SEE

00:40:44.241 --> 00:40:46.477
AN INCREASE IN THE USE OF

00:40:46.544 --> 00:40:47.144
SPECIALTY DRUGS- AND IN THE IN

00:40:47.211 --> 00:40:48.679
THE TRUCKS ARE OBVIOUSLY

00:40:48.746 --> 00:40:49.246
TYPICALLY- COST QUITE A BIT

00:40:49.313 --> 00:40:52.650
MORE- THAN CONVENING STANDARD

00:40:52.716 --> 00:40:54.351
MEDICATION- ANYONE THAT MAY OR

00:40:54.418 --> 00:40:56.754
MAY NOT BE SO- YOU KNOW FROM

00:40:56.821 --> 00:40:59.256
FROM I THINK FROM THE CHAMBERS

00:40:59.323 --> 00:41:00.291
PERSPECTIVE IN IT THAT'S WHERE

00:41:00.357 --> 00:41:01.125
THEY WERE LOOKING AT THAT THE

00:41:01.192 --> 00:41:02.226
RISING COSTS IS GREATER

00:41:02.293 --> 00:41:04.028
UTILIZATION AND POTENTIALLY

00:41:04.094 --> 00:41:05.563
GREATER USE A SPECIALTY DRUGS

00:41:05.629 --> 00:41:08.165
FOR BRAND NAME DRUGS- IT IN IN

00:41:08.232 --> 00:41:10.801
LIEU OF USING- ENGINEERING OR

00:41:10.868 --> 00:41:11.468
LOWER COSTS ARE LOWER COST

00:41:11.535 --> 00:41:13.537
ALTERNATIVE BUT IT'S ONLY FOR

00:41:13.604 --> 00:41:15.306
THAT TIME PERIOD FROM ZERO TO

00:41:15.372 --> 00:41:16.674
THIRTY DAYS FOR THE REVIEW

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:19.877
RIGHT. OR NOT YOU CAN DENY IT

00:41:19.944 --> 00:41:21.245
YEAH I GUESS GENERALLY SPEAKING

00:41:21.312 --> 00:41:22.379
SO DURING THE APPEAL PROCESS

00:41:22.446 --> 00:41:24.248
LIKE AS ONCE IT'S ONCE IT'S

00:41:24.315 --> 00:41:25.516

BACK TO THE OPIOID- ISSUE WHAT

00:41:53.978 --> 00:41:56.680
WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT WAS THE

00:41:56.747 --> 00:41:57.348
CARE SYSTEM THAT'S ALREADY. OUR

00:41:57.414 --> 00:41:58.382
DATABASE IS ALREADY IN PLACE IN

00:41:58.449 --> 00:42:00.117
CALIFORNIA WHICH WOULD ADDRESS

00:42:00.184 --> 00:42:01.352
YOU KNOW IF THERE IS OVER

00:42:01.418 --> 00:42:03.320
PRESCRIBING OF OPIOIDS THAT WE

KIND OF ALREADY HAVE SOMETHING

00:42:04.555 --> 00:42:06.023

YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHEN SEVEN

00:42:19.036 --> 00:42:22.306
OPP OPIOIDS. LIKE THE THIRD COST

00:42:22.373 --> 00:42:24.308
IS NOT THE ISSUE BUT AS WE KNOW

00:42:24.375 --> 00:42:26.410
WITH OPIOIDS ARE THOSE ARE

00:42:26.477 --> 00:42:27.311
TYPICALLY NOT I'M SURE THERE'S

00:42:27.378 --> 00:42:28.145
SOME SPECIALIZED KIND OF OPENS

00:42:28.212 --> 00:42:30.214
THE GENERALLY THOSE ARE OFTEN

00:42:30.281 --> 00:42:31.348
GENERIC AND THEY'RE NOT

00:42:31.415 --> 00:42:32.349
PARTICULARLY EXPENSIVE THAT'S

00:42:32.416 --> 00:42:34.184
NOT WHAT THE FIGHT OF IS ABOUT.

00:42:34.251 --> 00:42:36.220
AND IT IS OFTEN ABOUT THE

00:42:36.287 --> 00:42:39.823
BIOLOGICS AND THE FACT THAT THEY

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:42.259
THEY DO DENY- COVERED FOR

00:42:42.326 --> 00:42:45.496
BIOLOGICS AT TIMES- AND NOT

00:42:45.562 --> 00:42:46.330
OTHERWISE THEY WOULDN'T BE

00:42:46.397 --> 00:42:48.432
FIGHTING. THIS BILL RIGHT THERE

00:42:48.499 --> 00:42:50.234

THAT EVEN IF YOUR DOCTOR SAYS.

00:42:51.936 --> 00:42:54.071
THAT YOU NEED TO CHANGE IT DOES

00:42:54.138 --> 00:42:55.906
OR YOU NEED TO HAVE INTRACTABLE

00:42:55.973 --> 00:42:58.642
INSTEAD OF A PILL- THEY WANT TO

00:42:58.709 --> 00:43:00.277
RESERVE THE RIGHT TO JUST BE

00:43:00.344 --> 00:43:02.346
ABLE TO REJECT THAT- AND THIS

00:43:02.413 --> 00:43:04.014
BILL SAYS YOU CAN'T YOU HAVE TO

00:43:04.081 --> 00:43:07.484
LISTEN TO WHAT THE DOCTOR SAYS

DON'T THINK FOR SHARING WITH THE

00:43:13.958 --> 00:43:15.626
I NOTICED A- ALWAYS EASY BUT

00:43:15.693 --> 00:43:16.994
THINK APPRECIATE THAT- AND

00:43:17.061 --> 00:43:19.063
APPRECIATE ALSO. WITH SOMEBODY

00:43:19.129 --> 00:43:20.497
WHO IS. NOT NOTHING YOUR FRAGILE

00:43:20.564 --> 00:43:21.565
BUT WITH VERY FRAGILE HEALTH

00:43:21.632 --> 00:43:23.300
CARE AND A LOT OF HEALTH CARE

00:43:23.367 --> 00:43:25.769
NEEDS AND A LOT OF INTERACTIONS

00:43:25.836 --> 00:43:27.004
WITH THE- PHYSICIANS AND

00:43:27.071 --> 00:43:28.539
PHARMACIES AND- HEALTH PLANS I

00:43:28.605 --> 00:43:31.241
KNOW IT'S ALWAYS. LESS EXPENSIVE

00:43:31.308 --> 00:43:32.810
TO RATION HEALTHCARE. ARE THAT'S

00:43:32.876 --> 00:43:34.445
JUST THE BASIC THE MORE YOU

00:43:34.511 --> 00:43:36.180
RUSSIAN HEALTH CARE THE LESS

00:43:36.246 --> 00:43:37.481
EXPENSIVE IT IS. AND WHAT

00:43:37.548 --> 00:43:38.415
INSURANCE ARE PAYING FOR IT

00:43:38.482 --> 00:43:39.316
THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT

00:43:39.383 --> 00:43:41.318
THEY'RE MARKING A NINE IT COMES.

00:43:41.385 --> 00:43:43.053
BACK TO ALL OF US OF COURSE- BUT

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.989
I REALLY THINK WHEN WE'RE MAKING

00:43:45.055 --> 00:43:46.824
DECISIONS LIKE THIS ONE OF THE

00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:47.324
THINGS THAT I HEARD THE

00:43:47.391 --> 00:43:49.727
OPPOSITION SAY WAS- IT. IT

00:43:49.793 --> 00:43:51.762
DISRUPTS THE- STANDARD

00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:54.832
UTILIZATION PROCESS- BUT- WE'VE

00:43:54.898 --> 00:43:56.300
BEEN DOING UTILIZATION REVIEW

00:43:56.367 --> 00:43:57.868
SINCE. THE BEGINNING OF TIME.

00:43:57.935 --> 00:43:59.169
WELL NOT BEGINNING BUT- THE

00:43:59.236 --> 00:44:02.172
LAST. THE LAST COUPLE DECADES IN

00:44:02.239 --> 00:44:03.941
HEALTH CARE. MAYBE IT'S TIME TO

00:44:04.008 --> 00:44:05.442
CHANGE OF THOSE PROCESSES RIGHT

00:44:05.509 --> 00:44:07.277
WE CAN DO THAT WE CAN DO THAT IF

00:44:07.344 --> 00:44:08.412
THERE'S SOMEBODY WHO'S ON

00:44:08.479 --> 00:44:09.747
SOMETHING. LIKE THIS THAT'S

00:44:09.813 --> 00:44:11.415
THAT'S- VERY PRECISE AND NEW IN

00:44:11.482 --> 00:44:12.583
A BIOLOGIC. MAYBE THAT

00:44:12.649 --> 00:44:14.718
UTILIZATION REVIEW. COULD BE

00:44:14.785 --> 00:44:15.552
FASTER. THERE'S DIFFERENT THINGS

00:44:15.619 --> 00:44:17.354
WE CAN DO. THEN RUSSIAN HEALTH

00:44:17.421 --> 00:44:19.289
CARE WHICH OFTEN ENDS UP IN IN

00:44:19.356 --> 00:44:21.792
MORE SEVERE COST WHEN SOMEONE

00:44:21.859 --> 00:44:22.960
ENDS UP IN THE HOSPITAL. AS YOU

00:44:23.027 --> 00:44:25.662
SHARED YOUR DEBT. SO I THINK IS

00:44:25.729 --> 00:44:27.197
A GOOD BILL I THINK IT'S

00:44:27.264 --> 00:44:28.432
IMPORTANT I THINK. WE SPEND A

00:44:28.499 --> 00:44:30.267
LOT OF TIME AND INTEREST AND WE

00:44:30.334 --> 00:44:32.536
TAKE A LOT OF PRIDE IN. OUR

00:44:32.603 --> 00:44:33.971
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND DUBBED

00:44:34.038 --> 00:44:35.739
THEM THE OF THE FANTASTIC

00:44:35.806 --> 00:44:37.474
SCIENCE AND DRUGS THAT WE HAVE.

00:44:37.541 --> 00:44:38.509
TO IMPROVE PEOPLE'S LIVES TO

00:44:38.575 --> 00:44:40.444
EXPAND PEOPLE'S LIVES TO IMPROVE

00:44:40.511 --> 00:44:42.946
THE QUALITY. OF PEOPLE'S LIVES-

00:44:43.013 --> 00:44:44.581
AND IT SHOULD HAVE EVERY ACCESS

00:44:44.648 --> 00:44:46.850
TO THE THAT THEY POSSIBLY CAN

00:44:46.917 --> 00:44:49.086
AND IT SHOULD BE THE INSURANCES

00:44:49.153 --> 00:44:51.688
HAS NOW. SO I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE

00:44:51.755 --> 00:44:53.057
THIS BILL. THOSE MOVE A CENTER

00:44:53.123 --> 00:44:53.924

VIEW SHORT AND IT'S A FAIRLY

00:45:40.838 --> 00:45:42.506
STANDARD THAT WILL MINIMIZE THE

00:45:42.573 --> 00:45:44.308
COST TO SELL AND THE RESPONSE OF

DONE. IN THE LAST FEW YEARS JUST

00:47:07.057 --> 00:47:08.225
TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE

00:47:08.292 --> 00:47:10.394

SURE THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY

00:47:19.503 --> 00:47:21.371
ENFORCING. THOSE LAWS. AND THAT

00:47:21.438 --> 00:47:23.840
WHEN A HEALTH PLAN- VIOLATES THE

00:47:23.907 --> 00:47:25.943
LAW PARTICULARLY IN A PERSISTENT

00:47:26.009 --> 00:47:28.612
SYSTEMATIC WAY. THAT THE FINES

00:47:28.679 --> 00:47:31.415
IMPOSED ARE NOT VIEWED AS A COST

00:47:31.481 --> 00:47:34.117
OF DOING BUSINESS. BUT THE FINES

00:47:34.184 --> 00:47:35.586
ACTUALLY MEANS SOMETHING AND

00:47:35.652 --> 00:47:38.121
CREATE A DETERRENT BECAUSE WHEN

00:47:38.188 --> 00:47:40.824
A PATIENT IS TONIGHT CARE- EVEN

00:47:40.891 --> 00:47:43.060
IF THEY'RE ALTERNATELY JANET.

00:47:43.126 --> 00:47:45.395
MONTHS OR YEARS LATER WHEN THE

00:47:45.462 --> 00:47:48.198
INSURANCE PLAN IS FOUNDED IN A

00:47:48.265 --> 00:47:50.067
BALL THAT DOESN'T HELP THEM FOR

00:47:50.133 --> 00:47:52.002
ALL THE TIME THEY'VE HAD TO WAIT

00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:53.904
WE WANT TO GET IT UP FRONT WHERE

00:47:53.971 --> 00:47:55.172
THE HELL TIMES DO THE RIGHT

00:47:55.239 --> 00:47:56.974
THING AND FOLLOW THE LAW AND TO

00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.542
BE CLEAR THIS IS ABOUT. TIMES

00:47:58.609 --> 00:48:00.510
WHEN HEALTH PLANS VIOLATE THE

00:48:00.577 --> 00:48:01.778
LAW NOT WHEN THEY'RE ARGUABLY

00:48:01.845 --> 00:48:03.714
BILINGUAL BUT WHEN THEY HAVE

00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:06.049
BEEN FOUND BY THE STATE TO HAVE

00:48:06.116 --> 00:48:07.618
VIOLATED THE LAW BY DENYING

00:48:07.684 --> 00:48:10.354
HEALTH CARE COVERAGE TO SOMEONE

00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:12.723
WHO IS ENTITLED. TO THAT

00:48:12.789 --> 00:48:16.727
COVERAGE- WE KNOW THAT ALL TOO

00:48:16.793 --> 00:48:18.495
OFTEN THE FINES ARE VERY LOW.

00:48:18.562 --> 00:48:20.564
THERE WAS A RECENT- VERY LARGE

00:48:20.631 --> 00:48:23.200
FINE- ANNOUNCED AGAINST LA CARE

00:48:23.267 --> 00:48:25.502
WHICH WAS LA COUNTY'S PUBLICLY

00:48:25.569 --> 00:48:27.571
ON HEALTH PLAN THAT INSURANCE

00:48:27.638 --> 00:48:30.540
TWO MILLION MEDIC HELP PATIENTS-

00:48:30.607 --> 00:48:31.975
THIS WAS THE LARGEST PENALTY IN

00:48:32.042 --> 00:48:33.877
STATE HISTORY AND SO MADE

00:48:33.944 --> 00:48:36.213
HEADLINES IS A BIG DEAL- AND

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:39.483
YET. THE PER VIOLATION IT WAS A

00:48:39.549 --> 00:48:41.318
FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS IT'D BEEN

00:48:41.385 --> 00:48:44.087
THAT SYSTEMATIC AND PERVASIVE

00:48:44.154 --> 00:48:45.956
AND SO PER VIOLATION IT WAS

00:48:46.023 --> 00:48:50.327
STILL EXTREMELY. LOW EVEN WE

00:48:50.394 --> 00:48:51.895
HAVE A SEEM TO HIGH FOR. YOU

00:48:51.962 --> 00:48:54.831
LOOK AT YEAR AND THE SUPER OF

00:48:54.898 --> 00:48:56.466
THOSE. IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT

00:48:56.533 --> 00:48:58.769
BIG OF FINE. IN TERMS OF THE

00:48:58.835 --> 00:49:02.172
HARM- THAT WAS INFLICTED ON SO

00:49:02.239 --> 00:49:05.742
WHAT THIS- WHAT THIS BILL WILL

00:49:05.809 --> 00:49:08.478
DO IS TAKE THE FIND THAT

00:49:08.545 --> 00:49:11.281
EXISTING LAW WHICH IS TWENTY

00:49:11.348 --> 00:49:12.616
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. PER

00:49:12.683 --> 00:49:14.685
VIOLATION. WHICH WAS SET IN THE

00:49:14.751 --> 00:49:16.820
LATE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. HAS NOT

00:49:16.887 --> 00:49:18.822
BEEN ADJUSTED EVEN FOR INFLATION

00:49:18.889 --> 00:49:21.358
SEND SEND. AND WILL INCREASE IT

00:49:21.425 --> 00:49:23.126
TO A FINE OF TWENTY FIVE

00:49:23.193 --> 00:49:25.062
THOUSAND. PER VIOLATION I KNOW

00:49:25.128 --> 00:49:27.564
SOME SAID WELL IT'S A TEN FOLD

00:49:27.631 --> 00:49:28.965
INCREASE FOR TALKING ABOUT A

00:49:29.032 --> 00:49:30.834
HUGE PERIOD OF TIME. WHERE THIS

00:49:30.901 --> 00:49:32.536
VERY OUTDATED FIND LEVELS BEEN

00:49:32.602 --> 00:49:34.771
IN PLACE THAT IS NOT CREATING A

00:49:34.838 --> 00:49:37.774
DETERRENT IT IS COST OF DOING

00:49:37.841 --> 00:49:39.509
BUSINESS AND ESPECIALLY WHEN

00:49:39.576 --> 00:49:41.178
HEALTH CARE IS NOT CHEAP. AND

00:49:41.244 --> 00:49:42.679
YOU HAVE A LOW FINE PER

00:49:42.746 --> 00:49:44.748
VIOLATION. BUT UNFORTUNATELY

00:49:44.815 --> 00:49:47.384
CREATES INCENTIVES TO VIEW IT AS

00:49:47.451 --> 00:49:48.852
A COST OF DOING BUSINESS I WANT

00:49:48.919 --> 00:49:50.053
TO BE CLEAR THIS IS NOT ABOUT

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:51.755
BROAD BRUSHING. OR DEMONIZING

00:49:51.822 --> 00:49:54.825
THE HEALTH PLANS. A LOT OF THE

00:49:54.891 --> 00:49:55.459
HEALTH PLANS YOU'RE VERY VERY

00:49:55.525 --> 00:49:57.227
FREQUENTLY- PROVIDING PRODUCTS

00:49:57.294 --> 00:49:59.329
COVERAGE AND NOT CAUSING

00:49:59.396 --> 00:50:00.497
PROBLEMS AND NOT BY ALLOWING THE

00:50:00.564 --> 00:50:02.866
LAW BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THE

00:50:02.933 --> 00:50:04.368
BAR. THEY NEED TO BE ACCOUNTABLE

00:50:04.434 --> 00:50:05.869

THINGS. AND WE KNOW THAT AND SO

01:05:17.179 --> 01:05:18.914
ERROR. FOR MENTAL HEALTH. THERE

01:05:18.981 --> 01:05:21.817
THERE ARE A LOT OF PROBLEMS IN

01:05:21.884 --> 01:05:22.918
TERMS OF COVERAGE BEING. EITHER

01:05:22.985 --> 01:05:23.519
EXPLICITLY OR EFFECTIVELY. HI

01:05:23.586 --> 01:05:25.554
I'D- AND THERE HAS TO BE BETTER

01:05:25.621 --> 01:05:26.389
ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE CURRENT

01:05:26.455 --> 01:05:28.357
SYSTEM. DOES NOT CREATE

01:05:28.424 --> 01:05:30.059
ACCOUNTABILITY AND IF YOU LOOK

01:05:30.126 --> 01:05:32.028
AT YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THEIR

01:05:32.094 --> 01:05:33.062
APPREHENSION THAT YOU'RE NOW

01:05:33.129 --> 01:05:35.331
CREATING A FLOOR. BUT THAT WHAT

01:05:35.398 --> 01:05:36.866
THAT MEANS IS IT'S ENFORCEMENT

01:05:36.932 --> 01:05:39.902
FLEXIBILITY. TO ACTUALLY IMPOSE

01:05:39.969 --> 01:05:42.338
A PENALTY THAT CORRESPONDS TO.

01:05:42.405 --> 01:05:45.274
YOUR AND- IT'S JUST NOT REGIS IT

AFFLICTED WITH A SMALL AMOUNT.

01:05:49.045 --> 01:05:52.281
OR A LARGE AMOUNT- AND- SO WE

01:05:52.348 --> 01:05:53.649
SHOULD HAVE THAT A MINISTER

01:05:53.716 --> 01:05:56.485
FLEXIBILITY AND RESPECTFULLY-

01:05:56.552 --> 01:06:01.724

HE'S IS NOT ONE OF THEM- DAMAGE

01:06:09.965 --> 01:06:12.401
SHE HAS. FRANKLY IN MY VIEW RED

01:06:12.468 --> 01:06:14.003
IS A- TO REALLY GO AFTER SOME OF

01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:16.339

LEGISLATION. THIS BILL WOULD

01:10:08.604 --> 01:10:10.806
REQUIRE INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR

BIOMARKER TESTING FOR ALL

01:10:12.308 --> 01:10:15.210
DISEASES BUT TODAY I WILL SPEAK

01:10:15.277 --> 01:10:17.212
THE BIOMARKER TESTING IN CANCER

01:10:17.279 --> 01:10:18.314
BECAUSE THIS IS THE AREA I KNOW

01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:20.583
BEST. IN CANCER BIOMARKER

01:10:20.649 --> 01:10:23.385
TESTING IS CRITICAL IN MANY

01:10:23.452 --> 01:10:25.187
STEPS OF THE PATIENT'S CARE.

01:10:25.254 --> 01:10:26.722
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CANCER

01:10:26.789 --> 01:10:28.190
TREATMENT BIOMARKER TESTING IS

01:10:28.257 --> 01:10:31.760
THE FIRST OF TWO STEPS WE TAKE

01:10:31.827 --> 01:10:32.928
TO MATCH PATIENTS TUMOR. ASIAN

01:10:32.995 --> 01:10:35.431
THERAPY THE TESTING OF TUMOR

01:10:35.497 --> 01:10:38.033
TISSUE OR BLOOD ALLOWS US TO

01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:40.603
LOOK AT THE TUMOR BIOLOGY AND

01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:43.205
IT'S VULNERABILITIES AND MAP TO

01:10:43.272 --> 01:10:44.473
THE RIGHT TREATMENT FOR THE

01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:46.475
PATIENT WE KNOW THAT PATIENTS TO

01:10:46.542 --> 01:10:48.277
RECEIVE THESE TARGETED THERAPIES

01:10:48.344 --> 01:10:50.746
CLEARLY PROVE SURVIVE AND

01:10:50.813 --> 01:10:54.083
OUTCOMES. ANOTHER ASPECT OF

01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:55.718
PROTECTING IT IS DETERMINED WHAT

01:10:55.784 --> 01:10:58.621
DRUGS WON'T WORK FOR A PATIENT'S

01:10:58.687 --> 01:11:00.823
TUMOR. IT HAD NEXT CANCERS WHICH

01:11:00.889 --> 01:11:02.191
IS WHAT I PRIMARILY SEE IN MY

01:11:02.257 --> 01:11:04.693
CLINIC IT'S A TYPE OF TUMOR THAT

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.528
WILL NOT RESPOND TO

01:11:06.595 --> 01:11:08.330
IMMUNOTHERAPY. AND CAN IDENTIFY

01:11:08.397 --> 01:11:10.566
THIS TYPE OF MARKET TESTING THEN

01:11:10.633 --> 01:11:12.134
THE PATIENT CAN RECEIVE THE

01:11:12.201 --> 01:11:15.037
RIGHT TREATMENT. AVOIDING

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:16.805
UNNECESSARY TOXICITY AND COST.

01:11:16.872 --> 01:11:18.607
FOR MANY OF THESE PATIENTS TIME

01:11:18.674 --> 01:11:21.744
IS OF THE ESSENCE. MY LAST POINT

01:11:21.810 --> 01:11:25.648
IS THAT THERE ARE STARK. THIRTY

01:11:25.714 --> 01:11:28.283

DIRECTLY FIT THAT THAT INDUSTRY

02:09:14.813 --> 02:09:17.583
RATES ITS BRICK AND MORTAR AND

02:09:17.649 --> 02:09:19.118

DISTINCTION BETWEEN MORE

NET. ALEX FACE CRIPPLING

02:59:26.555 --> 02:59:28.491
WORKFORCE SHORTAGES AT

INCREASINGLY HIGH TURNOVER RATES

02:59:30.826 --> 02:59:33.496
AMONG THEIR CARE GIVERS. IN FACT

02:59:33.562 --> 02:59:34.396
THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY CARE

02:59:34.463 --> 02:59:36.298
ASSOCIATION WHOSE OPPOSED TO

02:59:36.365 --> 02:59:38.467
THIS BILL REPORTS TO US HERE IN

02:59:38.534 --> 02:59:40.369
THE LEGISLATURE A MEDIAN

02:59:40.436 --> 02:59:42.271
TURNOVER RATE OF EIGHTEEN POINT

02:59:42.338 --> 02:59:45.207
2% IN THE TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE

02:59:45.274 --> 02:59:46.208
SURVEY. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT'S

02:59:46.275 --> 02:59:48.277
IMPORTANT BECAUSE JUST THE YEAR

02:59:48.344 --> 02:59:49.879
BEFORE THE TURNOVER RATE WAS

02:59:49.945 --> 02:59:53.616
SEVEN POINT 6% SEVEN POINT 6% A

02:59:53.682 --> 02:59:56.018
YEAR LATER THE TURNOVER RATE

02:59:56.085 --> 02:59:58.053
EIGHTEEN POINT. HOW LISA STOP

02:59:58.120 --> 02:59:59.722
THESE CRITICAL CLINICS WITH SUCH

02:59:59.788 --> 03:00:01.824
AN EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGE THIS

03:00:01.891 --> 03:00:03.759
IS A TIME WHEN CLINICS NEED. TO

03:00:03.826 --> 03:00:05.794
ONLY RETAIN THEIR WORKERS BUT

03:00:05.861 --> 03:00:08.030
ALSO NEED TO BE STAFFED UP TO

03:00:08.097 --> 03:00:10.232
MEETING INCREASING DEMAND FOR

03:00:10.299 --> 03:00:12.601
CARE AS I SUGGESTED. THE NUMBER

03:00:12.668 --> 03:00:13.169
ONE BERRY TO COMPLEMENT IN

03:00:13.235 --> 03:00:16.205
RETENTION IS COMPETITION WITH

03:00:16.272 --> 03:00:17.339
OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS FOR

03:00:17.406 --> 03:00:19.475
WORKERS. CLINIC SALARIES ARE

03:00:19.542 --> 03:00:21.810
MUCH LOWER AS WE ALL KNOW THAN

03:00:21.877 --> 03:00:23.078
THOSE PAID BY COMPETING

03:00:23.145 --> 03:00:24.180
PROVIDERS AND WORKERS ARE

03:00:24.246 --> 03:00:25.915
INCREASINGLY DISSATISFIED WITH

03:00:25.981 --> 03:00:29.318
THE EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGES OF

03:00:29.385 --> 03:00:29.818
THE FRONTLINE WORKPLACE

03:00:29.885 --> 03:00:32.054
CONDITIONS. SO GIVEN THAT WHAT

03:00:32.121 --> 03:00:34.490
DOES THIS MEAN WHAT DOES IT MEAN

03:00:34.557 --> 03:00:35.124
WHAT SHOULD WE DO AS A

03:00:35.191 --> 03:00:37.526
LEGISLATURE WHAT IT MEANS OR

03:00:37.593 --> 03:00:38.394
CRACK THAT CLINICS ARE AT A

03:00:38.460 --> 03:00:40.396
CROSSROADS WHERE IT IS

03:00:40.462 --> 03:00:42.231
INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO HIRE

03:00:42.298 --> 03:00:42.998
AND RETAIN STAFF TO SERVE

03:00:43.065 --> 03:00:46.468
PATIENTS AND MISSIONS TO. TAKE

03:00:46.535 --> 03:00:48.404
CARE OF FOLKS. IT ADEQUATE

03:00:48.470 --> 03:00:50.306
CLINICAL STAFFING MEANS LONGER

03:00:50.372 --> 03:00:53.475
WAIT TIMES AND DIMINISH CARE NOT

03:00:53.542 --> 03:00:55.611
ACCEPTABLE. WHICH MEANS PATIENTS

03:00:55.678 --> 03:00:57.246
ARE SLIPPING THROUGH THE CRACKS

03:00:57.313 --> 03:00:59.782
WE CAN'T TOLERATE THAT ALL OF

03:00:59.848 --> 03:01:01.383
THESE CHALLENGES JUST SET US

03:01:01.450 --> 03:01:03.619
FURTHER BACK. IN OUR MISSION TO

03:01:03.686 --> 03:01:05.287
ACHIEVE GREATER HEALTH EQUITY.

03:01:05.354 --> 03:01:06.722
THE LADIES HAVE A DEVASTATING

03:01:06.789 --> 03:01:08.457
AND LONG TERM AND LONG LASTING

03:01:08.524 --> 03:01:10.059
IMPACT ON OUR COMMUNITIES WHO

03:01:10.125 --> 03:01:13.395
CAN LEAST SHOULDER THAT BURDEN.

03:01:13.462 --> 03:01:15.698
SO HOW DOES THE BILL THAT'S

03:01:15.764 --> 03:01:17.199
BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE TODAY.

03:01:17.266 --> 03:01:19.935
SOLVE THIS ISSUE THE MEASURE

03:01:20.002 --> 03:01:21.503
PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

03:01:21.570 --> 03:01:23.005
ADDRESS THE LONG STANDING WORK

03:01:23.072 --> 03:01:25.708
FORCE SHORTAGES ND ENSURE THAT

03:01:25.774 --> 03:01:27.042
WE CAN DELIVER QUALITY CARE FOR

03:01:27.109 --> 03:01:29.511
OUR MOST VULNERABLE. THIS BILL

03:01:29.578 --> 03:01:32.615
S. B. TEN FOURTEEN CREATES AN

03:01:32.681 --> 03:01:34.717
OPTIONAL NEW SUPPLEMENTAL

03:01:34.783 --> 03:01:38.320
PROGRAM A NEW TOOL IF YOU WILL.

03:01:38.387 --> 03:01:40.522
FOR CLINICS TO TAP INTO

03:01:40.589 --> 03:01:42.558
DESPERATELY NEEDED RESOURCES.

03:01:42.625 --> 03:01:43.993
ALLOCATED FUNDS WILL ALLOW

03:01:44.059 --> 03:01:45.594
CLINICS TO HIRE AND RETAIN CARE

03:01:45.661 --> 03:01:47.763
GIVERS INCREASED TRAINING AND

03:01:47.830 --> 03:01:49.431
INCREASED CAPITAL INVESTMENTS

03:01:49.498 --> 03:01:51.834
FUNDS WILL BE USED TO PAY CLINIC

03:01:51.900 --> 03:01:53.702
WORKERS A MINIMUM OF TWENTY FIVE

03:01:53.769 --> 03:01:55.237
DOLLARS AN HOUR. THAT SOUNDS

03:01:55.304 --> 03:01:57.940
LIKE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A

03:01:58.007 --> 03:01:59.141
FIFTEEN DOLLAR AN HOUR MINIMUM

03:01:59.208 --> 03:02:01.977
WAGE IS A LOT OF MONEY BUT LET

03:02:02.044 --> 03:02:02.544
ME TELL YOU COMPLEMENT NOT

03:02:02.611 --> 03:02:06.649
CHANGED COUNTY. IN ORDER TO FOR

03:02:06.715 --> 03:02:08.417
HIS. A MINIMUM WAGE IF THE NINE

DOLLARS AN HOUR. BY ORDERS OF

03:02:10.619 --> 03:02:11.787
MAGNITUDE IT'S IMPORTANT BUT

03:02:11.854 --> 03:02:13.155
FUNDAMENTALLY DOESN'T ADDRESS

03:02:13.222 --> 03:02:15.391
THE ISSUES BUT IT IS A BIG STEP

03:02:15.457 --> 03:02:17.893
FORWARD. SO THIS MEASURE SB TEN

03:02:17.960 --> 03:02:19.928
FOURTEEN. ENCOURAGES

03:02:19.995 --> 03:02:21.664
COLLABORATIONS BETWEEN CLINICS

03:02:21.730 --> 03:02:23.632
WORKERS AND PATIENTS FOR

03:02:23.699 --> 03:02:24.166
RECRUITMENT AND TRAINING

03:02:24.233 --> 03:02:26.502
PROGRAMS. THESE PARTNERSHIPS

03:02:26.568 --> 03:02:28.337
WILL FOCUS ON CREATING PATHWAYS

03:02:28.404 --> 03:02:29.838
MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR HEALTH CARE

03:02:29.905 --> 03:02:31.373
CAREERS IN CLINICS PROVIDING

03:02:31.440 --> 03:02:33.609

DIRECTED IMPROVING CARE

03:02:44.186 --> 03:02:47.056
INVESTING AT THE CLINIC HEALTH

03:02:47.122 --> 03:02:48.190
CARE WORKFORCE. THE RISK A

03:02:48.257 --> 03:02:49.992
SHOULD ASK PARK IS PART OF THIS

03:02:50.059 --> 03:02:51.994
MEASURE OF FOUR HUNDRED MILLION

03:02:52.061 --> 03:02:53.462
DOLLARS IN THE STATE OVER THE

03:02:53.529 --> 03:02:54.496
NEXT THREE YEARS RUNNING

03:02:54.563 --> 03:02:56.632
PARALLEL TO THIS THROUGH THE

03:02:56.699 --> 03:02:59.268
BUDGET PROCESS THE LETTER HAS

03:02:59.335 --> 03:03:00.336
FORTY TWO MEMBERS OF THIS

03:03:00.402 --> 03:03:02.705
LEGISLATURE OF BOTH HOUSES IN

03:03:02.771 --> 03:03:05.007
SUPPORT OF THAT BUDGET REQUEST.

03:03:05.074 --> 03:03:07.076
AND WITH THIS INVESTMENT THE

03:03:07.142 --> 03:03:09.244
STATE WILL BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE

03:03:09.311 --> 03:03:11.347
AN ADDITION. SIX HUNDRED MILLION

03:03:11.413 --> 03:03:13.215
DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDING. THIS

03:03:13.282 --> 03:03:15.117
MEANS WILL BRING A TOTAL OF A

03:03:15.184 --> 03:03:16.785
BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW REVENUE

03:03:16.852 --> 03:03:18.420
TO SUPPORT OUR CLINICS AND

03:03:18.487 --> 03:03:20.723
ACCESS TO CARE. AND I STRESS

03:03:20.789 --> 03:03:22.591
THIS BECAUSE AS WE LOOK AT THE

03:03:22.658 --> 03:03:24.760
ANALYSIS OF HOW MUCH MONEY WE

03:03:24.827 --> 03:03:26.428
PAY IN CALIFORNIA TO THE FEDERAL

03:03:26.495 --> 03:03:27.830
GOVERNMENT HOW MUCH WE

03:03:27.896 --> 03:03:30.199
CONTRIBUTE THIS IS ONE OF THE

03:03:30.265 --> 03:03:32.501
PLACES THAT WE CAN. GET SOME OF

03:03:32.568 --> 03:03:33.369
OUR OWN TAX DOLLARS BACK THAT

03:03:33.435 --> 03:03:35.604
ARE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS PAY

03:03:35.671 --> 03:03:38.574
GETS FORTY IN FAIRNESS IN THE

03:03:38.640 --> 03:03:40.509
PROCESS. THE LIKELY FROM CLINICS

03:03:40.576 --> 03:03:42.177
OPPOSING IN OPPOSITION TO THIS

03:03:42.244 --> 03:03:43.345
MEASURE THE REAL PROBLEM WITH

03:03:43.412 --> 03:03:45.080
THE CLINIC BUDGET SHORTFALL IS

03:03:45.147 --> 03:03:46.415
DUE TO LOW MEDICARE

03:03:46.482 --> 03:03:47.783
REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND WE'VE

03:03:47.850 --> 03:03:49.151
HEARD YOU TALK ABOUT THAT MISTER

03:03:51.353 --> 03:03:52.388
DOUBT THAT THIS IS THE CASE

MEDICARE WAS UNDERFUNDED IT

03:03:53.789 --> 03:03:55.557
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. THERE IS

03:03:55.624 --> 03:03:58.794
NO QUESTION YOU KNOW THAT BETTER

03:03:58.861 --> 03:03:59.728
THAN ANYBODY. BUT THAT'S EXACTLY

03:03:59.795 --> 03:04:01.130
WHY WE SHOULD BE THINKING OF

SUPPLEMENTAL DOLLARS- AND- CMS

03:36:26.940 --> 03:36:29.042
ALLOWS THAT TO HAPPEN SO YOU'RE

03:36:37.484 --> 03:36:40.087
IS THIS MONEY WILL BE GOING. I

03:36:40.153 --> 03:36:43.757
MEAN- MOSTLY TOWARDS- SALARY

03:36:43.824 --> 03:36:45.759
INCREASES THE STREET IS THAT

03:36:45.826 --> 03:36:47.361
CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT AND WE

03:36:47.427 --> 03:36:48.562
NEED SALARY INCREASES BECAUSE

03:36:48.628 --> 03:36:49.563
WE'RE LOSING PEOPLE. ABOUT I

03:36:49.629 --> 03:36:50.630
MADE EARLIER ABOUT THE TURNOVER

03:36:50.697 --> 03:36:54.101
FROM 187% 18% AND THE PRESSURE

03:36:54.167 --> 03:36:55.035
THAT ORGANIZING SO WE NEED TO

03:36:55.102 --> 03:36:56.603
MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE IN

03:36:56.670 --> 03:36:57.471
COMMUNITY CLINICS ARE PROPERLY

NECESSARY SAFETY NET WHICH IS SO

03:37:04.177 --> 03:37:04.978
CRITICAL OKAY A DELIVERY SYSTEM

03:37:05.045 --> 03:37:07.547
THAT'S A CLEAR- BUT ACCORDING TO

03:37:07.614 --> 03:37:09.316
MY ANALYSIS IT SAYS IT CMS

03:37:09.383 --> 03:37:11.151
REQUIRES. THAT SUPPLEMENTAL

03:37:11.218 --> 03:37:13.186

03:38:14.915 --> 03:38:16.283
THAT FOR FEEL DIFFERENT CRITERIA

03:38:16.349 --> 03:38:17.651
THE FACT THAT THIS SUPPLEMENTAL

BE SET BY DH CS AND SO THEY'VE

03:38:32.399 --> 03:38:34.301
GOT A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY AND

03:38:34.367 --> 03:38:35.969
CONTROL TO BE ABLE TO DESIGN IT

03:38:36.036 --> 03:38:38.505

BEEN WORKING WITH DHS ON THIS SO

03:38:47.547 --> 03:38:50.016
FAR. SEN OKAY NO NOT YET NOT YET

03:38:50.083 --> 03:38:51.218
I MEAN THAT WOULD BE HAVE NOTED

03:38:51.284 --> 03:38:53.220
SORT OF HAVE THE CONVERSATION

03:38:53.286 --> 03:38:55.255
PRIOR TO ALL OF THIS TO KIND OF

03:38:55.322 --> 03:38:56.156
GET US A FEELING FOR WHERE THEY

03:38:56.223 --> 03:38:58.925

JUST THE WAY AND LOCAL CARE. THE

03:39:02.028 --> 03:39:05.265
OPPOSITE SO MEDICARE OF COURSE

03:39:05.332 --> 03:39:07.100
IS A FEDERAL STATE PARTNERSHIP

03:39:07.167 --> 03:39:09.035
SO IN ORDER TO GET THE WAIVERS

03:39:09.102 --> 03:39:10.670
GOTTA WORK WITH CMS AND IT'S

03:39:10.737 --> 03:39:12.873
THROUGH THE HCSO CMS'S USUALLY

03:39:12.939 --> 03:39:13.874
NOT INTEREST TALKING EVERYBODY

03:39:13.940 --> 03:39:17.143
THAT WE TALKED TO THE EIGHT CST

03:39:17.210 --> 03:39:18.778
EXCESSES IN THE STOCK RIGHT-

03:39:18.845 --> 03:39:20.947
THERE IS FLEXIBILITY BUT THERE'S

03:39:21.014 --> 03:39:23.316
ALSO A LOT OF RULES THERE SO I

03:39:23.383 --> 03:39:25.118
THINK PART OF WHAT WE TRIED TO

03:39:25.185 --> 03:39:27.287
DO AND- LOOKING MY CONSOLE THE-

03:39:27.354 --> 03:39:31.858
SAME RON HERE. IS THAT WHAT

03:39:31.925 --> 03:39:33.226
WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THE OF.

03:39:33.293 --> 03:39:34.995
THEM IS TRY TO CREATE THE

03:39:35.061 --> 03:39:35.462
OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT

03:39:35.529 --> 03:39:37.230
CONVERSATION A DH CS- TO SEE

03:39:37.297 --> 03:39:40.066
WHAT WE CAN TRY TO DO TO PULL

03:39:40.133 --> 03:39:41.401
DOWN THE FEDERAL FUNDS SO. IN

03:39:41.468 --> 03:39:42.435
SOME SENSES THE ANSWER IS KIND

03:39:42.502 --> 03:39:44.137
OF IN BETWEEN SO IT DEPENDS ON

03:39:44.204 --> 03:39:46.306
WHAT CMS IS WILLING TO DO SO

03:39:46.373 --> 03:39:48.742
THERE IS SOME FLEXIBILITY IN

03:39:48.808 --> 03:39:50.443
SCOPE. THAT YOU NOTICE THAT YOU

03:39:50.510 --> 03:39:53.813
HAD THE UP WITH. THE USER. THAT

03:39:53.880 --> 03:39:55.115
PROPONENTS SAYS. SHE DID YOU SAY

03:39:55.181 --> 03:39:56.983
YOU CAN GO TO SAUDI COULD IT HAS

03:39:57.050 --> 03:39:58.151
TO BE TIED TO QUALITY

03:39:58.218 --> 03:39:59.452
IMPROVEMENT. CELLS I THINK BOTH

03:39:59.519 --> 03:40:01.087
BOTH OF MY BEING ACCURATE IN

03:40:01.154 --> 03:40:02.789
THAT SENSE THAT YOU HAVE TO

03:40:02.856 --> 03:40:04.491
SHOWS. IT CAN'T IT. CAN'T JUST

03:40:04.558 --> 03:40:07.427
BE PASSED STATUS QUO BUT-

03:40:07.494 --> 03:40:09.963
EXACTLY WHAT IT IS- THERE'S SOME

03:40:10.030 --> 03:40:12.799
FLEXIBILITY THERE SO IF FOR

03:40:12.866 --> 03:40:14.935
EXAMPLE WE KNOW THAT- BECAUSE

03:40:15.001 --> 03:40:18.705
THE- HELP. THAT TURNOVER AND

03:40:18.772 --> 03:40:20.974
OTHER TYPES OF THINGS MAY LEAD

03:40:21.041 --> 03:40:22.642
TO POOR QUALITY. THAT WE CAN

03:40:22.709 --> 03:40:23.977
STILL IMPROVEMENT IN QUALITY AND

03:40:24.044 --> 03:40:25.312
RETENTION AND SO FORTH CERTAIN

03:40:25.378 --> 03:40:26.947
QUALITY MEASURES CMS MAYBE OPEN

03:40:27.013 --> 03:40:28.315
THE SAME GOOD. HE GETS MORE

03:40:28.381 --> 03:40:29.849
FUNDING BECAUSE OF THAT WE DON'T

03:40:29.916 --> 03:40:31.518
KNOW UNTIL THE CONVERSATIONS ARE

03:40:31.585 --> 03:40:33.453
HAD WITH CMS SO I THINK WHAT WE

03:40:33.520 --> 03:40:35.355
CRAFTED THE AMENDMENTS OURS TO

03:40:35.422 --> 03:40:37.057
SAY THAT. WE'RE GOING TO CREATE

03:40:37.123 --> 03:40:39.859
THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR-

03:40:39.926 --> 03:40:42.862
NEGOTIATION WAY OUT THE ALSO

03:40:42.929 --> 03:40:44.264
THAT- NO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

03:40:44.331 --> 03:40:45.565
JOHNNY HAS TO APPLY ACROSS

03:40:45.632 --> 03:40:47.767
CLINICS RIGHT SO IT'S- YOU CAN'T

03:40:47.834 --> 03:40:49.536
JUST A SUBSET OF THE CLINICS

03:40:49.603 --> 03:40:51.104
WILL HAVE TO BE AVAILABLE TO

03:40:51.171 --> 03:40:52.339
EVERYONE. AND AND THEN AFTER

03:40:52.405 --> 03:40:55.375
THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE

03:40:55.442 --> 03:40:56.943
AMENDMENTS THAT THE AUTHOR IS

03:40:57.010 --> 03:40:58.878
TAKING. ONLY BE SURE. THE

03:40:58.945 --> 03:41:01.081
SYSTEMS UP. OKAY WELL THANK YOU

03:41:01.147 --> 03:41:02.349
FOR THE CLARIFICATION BOTH THE

03:41:02.415 --> 03:41:04.951
VIEW I WONDER IF- THE OPPOSITION

03:41:05.018 --> 03:41:07.220
MIGHT WANT TO COME UP IN JUST ON

03:41:07.287 --> 03:41:09.889
INDY IS IT OKAY INDIGNITIES COME

03:41:09.956 --> 03:41:13.093
YEAH I WISH I COULD CITE YOU A

03:41:13.159 --> 03:41:14.060
RULE BOOK BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN

03:41:14.127 --> 03:41:16.096
LOOKING FOR THIS- WE'VE BEEN

03:41:16.162 --> 03:41:18.531
TALKED. OUT UNFORTUNATELY TWO

03:41:18.598 --> 03:41:20.533
EIGHT SEIZE IS EASY- BECAUSE OF

03:41:20.600 --> 03:41:21.601
HOW WE ARE REGULATED THERE'S A

03:41:21.668 --> 03:41:23.136
LOT OF OPPORTUNITY TO THAT BUT

03:41:23.203 --> 03:41:25.839
IT'S ALSO REALLY CHALLENGING SO-

03:41:25.905 --> 03:41:28.842
S. P. P. IS NOT RELATED TO FQHC

03:41:28.908 --> 03:41:32.045
WE TRIED SO MANY WAYS TO MAKE

03:41:32.112 --> 03:41:34.648
THE S. B. P. FOR THE PHARMACY

03:41:34.714 --> 03:41:36.116
TRANSITION WORK IN THE WAY THAT

03:41:36.182 --> 03:41:38.051
WE COULD IMAGINE IT FOR SUBSETS

03:41:38.118 --> 03:41:40.120
OF PROVIDERS FOR TARGETING THE

03:41:40.186 --> 03:41:42.288
DOLLARS IN A MORE SPUR SEIS WAY

03:41:42.355 --> 03:41:44.724
WORLD IRVINE BASED NEED BASED ON

03:41:44.791 --> 03:41:46.626
TYPES OF PROVIDERS AND THERE WAS

03:41:46.693 --> 03:41:51.364
WE FOUND BASICALLY NO WAYS TO DO

03:41:51.431 --> 03:41:55.402
IT- THAT THEIR PAY. A LOT FOR

03:41:55.468 --> 03:41:56.202
THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAID I AGREE

03:41:56.269 --> 03:41:58.371
WITH EVERYBODY THAT WE SHOULD

03:41:58.438 --> 03:41:59.739
HAVE MORE IN PRIMARY CARE CMS

03:41:59.806 --> 03:42:01.241
BELIEVES I THINK IN SOME WAYS

03:42:01.307 --> 03:42:02.642
ARE PAYING TOO MUCH. SO THEY

03:42:02.709 --> 03:42:04.744
WANT EVIDENCE THAT IT'S NEW AND

03:42:04.811 --> 03:42:06.680
IT'S FOR BENEFICIARIES AND THEY

03:42:06.746 --> 03:42:08.081
ARE ALREADY IN THEIR MINDS

03:42:08.148 --> 03:42:10.417
PAYING FOR SALARIES IN OUR PPS

03:42:10.483 --> 03:42:13.053
RATES AND WE- WE AGREE. WE

03:42:13.119 --> 03:42:14.120
CANNOT KEEP UP WITH SALARY

03:42:14.187 --> 03:42:16.456
COSTS. THERE IS NO WAY PPS ALSO

03:42:16.523 --> 03:42:19.492
IF SALARY COSTS BECAUSE OF

03:42:19.559 --> 03:42:21.361
INFLATION GO UP 20% TOO BAD

03:42:21.428 --> 03:42:23.029
FRIEND Q. EIGHT C. IS NOTHING TO

03:42:23.096 --> 03:42:25.532
DO ABOUT YOUR PPS RATE TO MOVE

03:42:25.598 --> 03:42:26.299
THAT THAT'S NOT A TRIGGERING

03:42:26.366 --> 03:42:28.134
EVENT IT DOESN'T COUNT. SAM IN

03:42:28.201 --> 03:42:30.670
THE STATE WITH THE PARTY THOSE

03:42:30.737 --> 03:42:32.572
COSTS YOU HAVE TO FIND IT A

03:42:32.639 --> 03:42:33.306

LARGELY GOING TO SALARY COSTS.

AND EXTENDED HOURS AND

03:42:40.647 --> 03:42:42.115
ADDITIONAL SERVICES AND WE COULD

03:42:42.182 --> 03:42:43.983
NOT FIND A WAY TO MITIGATE IT

03:42:44.050 --> 03:42:46.052
WITH THE S. P. P. BASED ON THE

03:42:46.119 --> 03:42:47.353
RULES THE DH CS SAID. THEY

03:42:47.420 --> 03:42:48.855
UNDERSTOOD CMS WOULD APPROVE OR

03:42:48.922 --> 03:42:51.157

I'M AN EXECUTIVE SHOULD HAVE

03:44:42.168 --> 03:44:44.070
TAKE ALL THAT IN CONTEXT SO WE

03:44:50.810 --> 03:44:52.879
LAYOFFS. BECAUSE YOU CN

03:44:52.946 --> 03:44:54.180

03:44:54.247 --> 03:44:56.349
THAT. WE HAVE LIMITED BUDGETS

03:44:56.416 --> 03:44:57.483
WITH LIMITED PERSPECTIVE

03:44:57.550 --> 03:45:01.287
PAYMENTS FROM THE FEDS AND SO.

03:45:01.354 --> 03:45:04.190
WE FILL IT COULD RICOCHET BACK

03:45:04.257 --> 03:45:06.192
IN THE PEOPLE WILL LOSE JOBS

03:45:06.259 --> 03:45:07.694
RENDON GAME WHERE MANY PEOPLE

03:45:07.760 --> 03:45:10.163
ARE GONNA LOSE JOBS. AND WE'RE

03:45:10.230 --> 03:45:12.031
ALREADY SHORT STAFFED WITH THIS

03:45:12.098 --> 03:45:13.900
. OKAY I SEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH

03:45:13.967 --> 03:45:15.468

03:45:19.305 --> 03:45:21.074
BILL IS I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE

03:45:21.140 --> 03:45:23.209
TRYING TO THAT'S A GOOD THING

03:45:23.276 --> 03:45:24.177
BUT IT'S CLEAR. THAT THERE ARE

03:45:24.244 --> 03:45:25.712
SOME PROBLEMS WITH HOW THIS GETS

03:45:25.778 --> 03:45:26.546
IMPLEMENTED IN WHO IS INCLUDES

03:45:26.613 --> 03:45:28.615
THE THANK YOU MISS SANCHEZ I

03:45:28.681 --> 03:45:29.582
APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THANK

03:45:29.649 --> 03:45:31.251
RESIDENTS THAT MENTOR. I'M SORRY

03:45:31.317 --> 03:45:33.019
REGISTER YES OF COURSE BECAUSE

03:45:33.086 --> 03:45:34.220
THE ARGUMENT IS A CIRCULAR

03:45:34.287 --> 03:45:37.257
ARGUMENT. RIGHT WE HAVE LAOS

03:45:37.323 --> 03:45:39.259
WILL LOSE IN FRONT LINE WORKERS

03:45:39.325 --> 03:45:40.894
WHO ARE EXHAUSTED WORKING IN THE

03:45:40.960 --> 03:45:42.495
CLINICS THE STORIES ARE

03:45:42.562 --> 03:45:46.165
EXTRAORDINARY WE WANT TO OFFER

03:45:46.232 --> 03:45:48.334
HIM A LIVING WAGE SO THEY CAN

03:45:48.401 --> 03:45:50.470
WORK IN THE CLINICS. AND SO.

03:45:50.536 --> 03:45:52.205
UPPERMOST PART OF MONEY THERE'S

03:45:52.272 --> 03:45:54.374
TWO SOURCES ONE IS FROM THE

03:45:54.440 --> 03:45:55.408
STATE ONCE IN THE FEDERAL

03:45:55.475 --> 03:45:56.643
GOVERNMENT I COULD TALK ABOUT

03:45:56.709 --> 03:45:58.111
THAT IN A SECOND WE'RE GOING TO

03:45:58.177 --> 03:46:00.079
RAISE THEIR WAGES TO THE STATE

03:46:00.146 --> 03:46:01.180
AND SO THE ARGUMENT IS WELL

03:46:01.247 --> 03:46:03.082
WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THEM AT LOW

03:46:03.149 --> 03:46:05.318
WAGES SO THEY CAN'T STAY SO WE

03:46:05.385 --> 03:46:06.219
CAN KEEP EXECUTIVES AND HIGHER

03:46:06.286 --> 03:46:08.321
WAGES I MEAN AT SOME POINT THE

03:46:08.388 --> 03:46:10.757
ARGUMENT GETS RIDICULOUS SO YES

03:46:10.823 --> 03:46:12.358
THIS IS A REALLY IMPACTFUL AND

03:46:12.425 --> 03:46:13.927
IT'S ONLY IT'S BASICALLY JUST

03:46:13.993 --> 03:46:15.528
YOU KNOW THE AGREEMENT TO PAY

03:46:15.595 --> 03:46:17.297
WORKERS TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS AN

03:46:17.363 --> 03:46:18.231
HOUR WITHIN THREE MONTHS OF

03:46:18.298 --> 03:46:19.332
RECEIVING THE SUPPLEMENTAL

03:46:19.399 --> 03:46:20.333
PAYMENT. BECAUSE THE WAY THIS IS

03:46:20.400 --> 03:46:22.035
WRITTEN IT'S NOT LIKE OH YOU GOT

03:46:22.101 --> 03:46:23.636
APPLY FOR SOMETHING WAY DOWN THE

03:46:23.703 --> 03:46:27.040
LINE AND CLOSELY GET PAID BACK

03:46:27.106 --> 03:46:28.741
YOU GET THE CASH AND THEN YOU'VE

03:46:28.808 --> 03:46:30.176
GOT TO PAY THEM AFTER. THEN

03:46:30.243 --> 03:46:31.678
PURCHASED. FINALLY MANAGING

03:46:31.744 --> 03:46:32.345
COOPERATION COMMITTEE WHICH WILL

03:46:32.412 --> 03:46:34.247
BE REGIONAL IN NATURE. SO THAT'S

03:46:34.314 --> 03:46:36.449
NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO OUR DATA

03:46:36.516 --> 03:46:38.051
SHOWS SIGNS THAT PEOPLE OF

03:46:38.117 --> 03:46:39.385
DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW. BUT

03:46:39.452 --> 03:46:41.854
BASICALLY OREGON DID THIS INTER

03:46:41.921 --> 03:46:43.957
UNDER THE- SAID THE QUOTE I GOT

03:46:44.023 --> 03:46:45.425
IT THE STATURE I GAVE YOU UDER

03:46:45.491 --> 03:46:46.559
THE SOCIAL SECURITY

03:46:46.626 --> 03:46:47.994
ADMINISTRATION STATURE THEY GAVE

03:46:48.061 --> 03:46:49.495
YOU. THEY WERE ABLE TO DO IT

03:46:49.562 --> 03:46:51.164
NINETY DAYS. AT THE ARGUMENT

03:46:51.230 --> 03:46:52.598
ISN'T JUST ABOUT WAGES. THE

03:46:52.665 --> 03:46:54.334
ARGUMENT IS ABOUT QUALITY OF

03:46:54.400 --> 03:46:55.435
CARE. THE ARGUMENT THAT THE

03:46:55.501 --> 03:46:57.570
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WE HAVE

03:46:57.637 --> 03:46:58.805
SOMEBODY HHS WAS A CALIFORNIAN

03:46:58.871 --> 03:47:00.039
WHO UNDERSTANDS THE CHALLENGES

03:47:00.106 --> 03:47:02.175
OF CALIFORNIA. IS THAT THE

03:47:02.241 --> 03:47:05.845
SYSTEM IS BREAKING. THAT THE

03:47:05.912 --> 03:47:08.348
PRESSURE IS KILLING US THAT.

03:47:08.414 --> 03:47:10.216
THERE'S AN IN A PRIMARY CARE

03:47:10.283 --> 03:47:12.385
WORKERS AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIX

03:47:12.452 --> 03:47:14.153
IT AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT

03:47:14.220 --> 03:47:15.621
OREGON THEY DID THE SAME THING

03:47:15.688 --> 03:47:17.523
NEW YORK. NEW YORK HAD A

03:47:17.590 --> 03:47:18.291
SITUATION WHERE THEY WERE ABLE

03:47:18.358 --> 03:47:20.293
IMPLEMENTED A SIMILAR PROGRAM

03:47:20.360 --> 03:47:21.627
THAT ADDRESSED PRIMARY CARE

03:47:21.694 --> 03:47:22.428
NEEDS OF THEIR MEDICARE

03:47:22.495 --> 03:47:24.364
POPULATIONS OREGON DID THE SAME

03:47:24.430 --> 03:47:25.732
THING. THAT WE DO HAVE

03:47:25.798 --> 03:47:26.733
PRECEDENCE OF OTHER

03:47:26.799 --> 03:47:27.600
JURISDICTION'S DOING THIS WITH

03:47:27.667 --> 03:47:29.402
CMS BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT

03:47:29.469 --> 03:47:31.504
THE WAGES. THERE'S A CAUSAL

03:47:31.571 --> 03:47:33.706
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WAGES AND

03:47:33.773 --> 03:47:37.477
THE SYSTEM WORKING. AND SO WE

03:47:37.543 --> 03:47:38.911
FEEL COMFORTABLE WE FEEL

03:47:38.978 --> 03:47:40.480
CONFIDENT REGARDLESS FLEXIBILITY

03:47:40.546 --> 03:47:42.882
IN IT AND THAT WE'VE GOT AN

03:47:42.949 --> 03:47:45.218
EMERGENCY SITUATION ON THE ONE

03:47:45.284 --> 03:47:46.486
HAND THE GOVERNMENT LEGISLATURES

03:47:46.552 --> 03:47:48.321
INCREASING IT. THE OTHER HAND AS

03:47:48.388 --> 03:47:50.356
I SAW. THE ROB IS THE FRONT LINE

03:47:50.423 --> 03:47:51.824
CLINICS THAT ARE REALLY MUCH

03:47:51.891 --> 03:47:54.060
MORE COST EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF

03:47:54.127 --> 03:47:55.395
THE INSTEAD OF THE ER. AND WE'RE

03:47:55.461 --> 03:47:57.530
TRYING TO OFFER UP A SOLUTION

03:47:57.597 --> 03:47:58.431
THAT'S INTELLIGENT. AND THERE'S

03:47:58.498 --> 03:48:02.168
NO NEED TO MAKE THIS THING WORK

03:48:02.235 --> 03:48:03.136
SO I UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENT

03:48:03.202 --> 03:48:05.872
EITHER SIDE BUT IT'S A LITTLE.

03:48:05.938 --> 03:48:09.942

03:48:22.355 --> 03:48:24.323
PERHAPS A YOU MAY HAVE. GONE A

03:48:24.390 --> 03:48:25.491
LITTLE FURTHER THAN THAT AND IT

03:48:25.558 --> 03:48:27.260
MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE WITH WHAT

03:48:27.326 --> 03:48:28.094

OBJECTION WOULD BE TO THE- THINK

REVIEW. OTHERS ESPECIALLY

04:12:06.678 --> 04:12:08.646
RELATED TO VERY SPECIALTY SORT

04:12:08.713 --> 04:12:10.482
OF DESIGNATIONS DO OUTSIDE

04:12:10.548 --> 04:12:12.217

04:12:12.283 --> 04:12:13.218
COMPANY THAT WE CONTRACT WITH

THAT DOES UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT

04:12:15.053 --> 04:12:16.387
THAT DOES IT FOR MULTIPLE

04:12:16.454 --> 04:12:18.122
BUSINESSES MULTIPLE COMPANIES

04:12:18.189 --> 04:12:22.160
ACROSS THE NATION. SO WERE KIND

04:12:22.227 --> 04:12:23.428
OF QUESTIONING. THERE'S ANOTHER

04:12:23.495 --> 04:12:25.697
CONVERSATION. THERE'S HAVING OUT

04:12:25.763 --> 04:12:27.465
AT ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION IF

04:12:27.532 --> 04:12:29.534
IT PROVIDES PROVIDED BY YOU OR A

04:12:29.601 --> 04:12:31.269
REVIEW BY THEREGULATOR BUT FOR

04:12:31.336 --> 04:12:33.304
A PROVIDER TO JESSE THAT. AND

04:12:33.371 --> 04:12:34.906
DENIALS THE MODIFICATIONS ARE

04:12:34.973 --> 04:12:37.041
OBVIOUSLY. THERE OFTENTIMES VERY

04:12:37.108 --> 04:12:39.244
COMPLICATED- SOMETIMES THERE'S A

04:12:39.310 --> 04:12:41.312
MODIFICATION BECAUSE THE DOSAGE

04:12:41.379 --> 04:12:43.214
THAT'S PRESCRIBED WE WANT THREE

04:12:43.281 --> 04:12:45.149
STEP THERAPY WE WANT YOU TO TRY

04:12:45.216 --> 04:12:47.652
AND FAIL ON A LOWER DOSAGE THAT

04:12:47.719 --> 04:12:48.520
WE BELIEVE IS MORE SAFER

04:12:48.586 --> 04:12:50.788
EFFICACY. REASONS SO THERE'S A

04:12:50.855 --> 04:12:52.824
LOT THAT GOES INTO THIS

04:12:52.891 --> 04:12:54.325
DETERMINATION SO JUST TO SEE A

04:12:54.392 --> 04:12:56.528
NUMBER WITH EXPLAINING NO I

04:12:56.594 --> 04:12:58.830
UNDERSTAND. HOW MANY DID I OPEN

04:12:58.897 --> 04:12:59.898
APPROVALS WE BELIEVE CREATES

04:12:59.964 --> 04:13:01.766
THIS KIND OF. HOSTILE

04:13:01.833 --> 04:13:03.835
ENVIRONMENT TO SUGGESTS THAT

04:13:03.902 --> 04:13:05.603
SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THAT

04:13:05.670 --> 04:13:08.873
WERE WERE AN EIGHT FIVE FIVE IS

04:13:08.940 --> 04:13:10.575
DONE A LOT THE REGULATIONS ARE

04:13:10.642 --> 04:13:12.343
IN PROCESS. I MEAN WE'VE WE'VE

04:13:12.410 --> 04:13:13.511
ALL MOVED TO A NONPROFIT

04:13:13.578 --> 04:13:14.579
CLINICAL CARE GUIDELINES WHICH I

04:13:14.646 --> 04:13:16.247
THINK THIS BILL SORT OF TRIES TO

04:13:16.314 --> 04:13:18.082
GET OUT. SO I THINK FROM OUR

04:13:18.149 --> 04:13:20.118
PERSPECTIVE WE'RE LOOKING TO

04:13:20.184 --> 04:13:22.520
THAT PROCESS TO LEND TOWARDS

04:13:22.587 --> 04:13:24.789
ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE THERE'S AN

04:13:24.856 --> 04:13:26.858
INTER RATER RELIABILITY FACTOR

04:13:26.925 --> 04:13:29.260
OF 90% FOR THE PLANS WHICH MEANS

04:13:29.327 --> 04:13:32.363
THAT THE NINE THAT THE PLAN HAS

04:13:32.430 --> 04:13:33.865
TO BE RIGHT NOW. PERCENT OF TIME

04:13:33.932 --> 04:13:38.603
. WE YOU WERE. FOR STATE AND I

04:13:38.670 --> 04:13:39.537
MEAN THAT'S IN. HIGH PRESSURE.

04:13:39.604 --> 04:13:41.105
AND DOESN'T ALLOW FOR A LOT OF.

04:13:41.172 --> 04:13:43.241
WRITER WRONG AND SO WE'RE REALLY

04:13:43.308 --> 04:13:44.108
LOOKING AT THAT IS TO HOLD THE

04:13:44.175 --> 04:13:46.344
STANDARD FOR US. NOT OBSCURE

04:13:46.411 --> 04:13:48.012
NUMBERS THAT MIGHT NOT REALLY

04:13:48.079 --> 04:13:52.183
BRING ANY VALUE. OKAY SO THEN- I

04:13:52.250 --> 04:13:54.519
JUST NEED TO KNOW THE STATEMENT

04:13:54.586 --> 04:13:57.188
THAT. OPPONENTS HAVE CONCERNS

04:13:57.255 --> 04:13:59.390
ABOUT THE DISCLOSURES AND THAT

04:13:59.457 --> 04:14:00.892
IT WOULD CREATE A TEDIOUS AND

04:14:00.959 --> 04:14:02.627
PREJUDICIAL DISCLOSURE PROCESS

04:14:02.694 --> 04:14:04.662
LEAVING THE PATIENT WITH THE

04:14:04.729 --> 04:14:06.130
IMPRESSION THAT THERE'S SOME

04:14:06.197 --> 04:14:07.966
SORT OF PUNITIVE EFFORT IT. SO

04:14:08.032 --> 04:14:09.867
YOU SEE YOU STAND BY THAT

04:14:09.934 --> 04:14:12.604
OPINION. THAT THE PATIENT WOULD

04:14:12.670 --> 04:14:13.972
FEEL THAT IT WELL THE QUESTION

04:14:14.038 --> 04:14:15.640
IS IF YOU GUYS I'M TRYING TO

04:14:15.707 --> 04:14:18.209
UNDERSTAND HOW DOES THE PATIENT

04:14:18.276 --> 04:14:19.978
YOU KNOW. HOW ARE THEY EVEN

04:14:20.044 --> 04:14:21.045
AWARE OF THIS AND HOW WITH THE

04:14:21.112 --> 04:14:22.614
PAY. THE DEBTS PUNITIVE THAT

04:14:22.680 --> 04:14:25.683
BOOK AS THE BILL REQUIRES EVERY-

04:14:25.750 --> 04:14:29.087

04:14:32.957 --> 04:14:34.826
ASSISTANCE TO CALL NUMBER A

04:14:34.892 --> 04:14:36.127

04:14:40.632 --> 04:14:41.633
BUT AS A PATIENT. LOOKING AT

04:14:41.699 --> 04:14:44.302
THAT BIG THEY RECEIVE IT SO OUR

04:14:44.369 --> 04:14:46.237
OUR CONCERN IS THAT THE PATIENTS

04:14:46.304 --> 04:14:47.839
GOING TO SEE IT AND MAYBE THEY

04:14:47.905 --> 04:14:49.941
SAY TO USE THE NUMBER- A

04:14:50.008 --> 04:14:51.509
REVIEWER SAY OVER THE LAST

04:14:51.576 --> 04:14:52.810
EIGHTEEN MONTHS IS DONE A

04:14:52.877 --> 04:14:54.545
HUNDRED REVIEWS. AND THERE'S

04:14:54.612 --> 04:14:57.682
SPEND 70% WHERE THERE'S BEEN A

04:14:57.749 --> 04:14:59.283
DIALER MODIFICATION AND 30% OF

04:14:59.350 --> 04:15:01.853
PATIENTS GOING TO LOOK AT THAT

04:15:01.919 --> 04:15:03.221
AND ASSUME. THAT THERE IS SOME

04:15:03.287 --> 04:15:05.323
REASON FOR WHICH THERE IS A

04:15:05.390 --> 04:15:06.357
PUNITIVE EXPECTATION OF WHY

04:15:06.424 --> 04:15:07.925
THEY'RE BEING DENIED WHAT MAY

04:15:07.992 --> 04:15:10.995
JUST BE. THAT REVIEWERS NUMBERS

04:15:11.062 --> 04:15:13.631
DON'T TELL YOU THE BOTH VERY

04:15:13.698 --> 04:15:17.568
AND- THE QUESTION FOR US IS IF

04:15:17.635 --> 04:15:20.738
IT DOESN'T BRING VALUE. IT'S I

04:15:20.805 --> 04:15:22.006
MEAN THIS IS EVER WE CONTRACT

04:15:22.073 --> 04:15:23.074
WITH FOR UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT

04:15:23.141 --> 04:15:24.642
STORE THEY REPORTING ON ALL THE

04:15:24.709 --> 04:15:26.010

CONSTANTLY DOING REVIEWS SO.

04:15:37.455 --> 04:15:38.890
THERE'S A LOT OF BACK AND WORK

04:15:38.956 --> 04:15:40.358
THAT GOES INTO THAT AND THE

04:15:40.425 --> 04:15:42.927
QUESTION IS. DOES IT BRING VALUE

04:15:42.994 --> 04:15:44.662
TO THE PATIENT OR DOES IT SIMPLY

04:15:44.729 --> 04:15:46.998
MAKE THEM FEEL LIKE WHEN I'M

04:15:47.065 --> 04:15:48.366
LOOKING AT THESE NUMBERS AND I

04:15:48.433 --> 04:15:50.501

EXASPERATED BY TWO YEARS PLUS.

04:25:11.161 --> 04:25:13.030

OF THAT HEARING. TWO MAJOR

04:25:22.339 --> 04:25:24.675

NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT OURS OUR

04:25:26.076 --> 04:25:28.312
SYSTEM IS WORKING- DESPITE THE

04:25:28.379 --> 04:25:29.680
ORDERS FINDING THERE ALSO

04:25:29.747 --> 04:25:31.115
APPEARS TO BE A VARIATION FROM

04:25:31.181 --> 04:25:31.849
COUNTY TO COUNTY AND HOW

04:25:31.915 --> 04:25:34.351
DANGEROUS THIS AND GREAT

04:25:34.418 --> 04:25:36.186
DISABILITY ARE INTERPRETED. AND

AGAIN YOU HEARD A COUPLE WEEKS

04:25:37.388 --> 04:25:39.990
AGO- THE BILL ADDRESSING THE

04:25:40.057 --> 04:25:43.594
LACK OF DATA- THAT THAT THAT

04:25:43.661 --> 04:25:44.595
PASSED UNANIMOUSLY THROUGH THIS

04:25:44.662 --> 04:25:46.397
COMMITTEE. AND NOW THIS BILL

04:25:46.463 --> 04:25:48.232
TACKLES THAT AS A PART OF IT

04:25:48.299 --> 04:25:49.533
WHEN CARE IS NOT AVAILABLE

04:25:49.600 --> 04:25:51.869
PEOPLE ARE OFTEN LOCKED UP. SENT

04:25:51.935 --> 04:25:54.405
TO JAIL. LEFT TO LANGUISH AND OR

04:25:54.471 --> 04:25:56.874
THEY DIE. WHICH GETS TO THE

04:25:56.940 --> 04:25:58.709
POINT OF THIS BILL WE DON'T WANT

04:25:58.776 --> 04:25:59.943
MORE PEOPLE TO BE TREATED

04:26:00.010 --> 04:26:02.446
INVOLUNTARILY HAVE FLIES IN THE

04:26:02.513 --> 04:26:03.380
FACE OF ALL THE OTHER WORK

04:26:03.447 --> 04:26:04.715
INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE DOING.

04:26:04.782 --> 04:26:06.550
BUT THE REALITY IS PEOPLE ARE D.

04:26:06.617 --> 04:26:09.286
COMPENSATING TO THE POINT WHERE

04:26:09.353 --> 04:26:10.454
THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO CARE FOR

04:26:10.521 --> 04:26:12.623
THEMSELVES. FIFTY FOUR SIXTEEN

04:26:12.690 --> 04:26:14.191
AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED. WOULD

04:26:14.258 --> 04:26:16.060
ALLOW FOR INVOLUNTARY CARE WITH

04:26:16.126 --> 04:26:17.661
ALL OF THE EXISTING DUE PROCESS

04:26:17.728 --> 04:26:19.229
PROTECTIONS IF SOMEONE IS SO

04:26:19.296 --> 04:26:20.364
MENTALLY ILL THAT THEY CANNOT

04:26:20.431 --> 04:26:22.166
PROVIDE FOR THEIR OWN MEDICAL

04:26:22.232 --> 04:26:23.167
CARE TO THE POINT THAT THEY ARE

04:26:23.233 --> 04:26:25.836
AT RISK OF. SUBSTANTIAL BODILY

04:26:25.903 --> 04:26:27.504
HARM. DANGEROUS DANGEROUS

04:26:27.571 --> 04:26:29.273
WORSENING OF ANY RELATED SERIOUS

04:26:29.340 --> 04:26:32.810
PHYSICAL ILLNESS. OR SIGNIFICANT

04:26:32.876 --> 04:26:35.012
PSYCHIATRIC DETERIORATION. WHY

04:26:35.079 --> 04:26:36.714
WOULD WE NOT WANT TO PROVIDE

04:26:36.780 --> 04:26:38.582
THAT TO PEOPLE IS THE BIGGER

04:26:38.649 --> 04:26:40.484
QUESTION. THE OPS SYSTEM HAS

04:26:40.551 --> 04:26:42.119
SIGNIFICANT GUARD RAILS AS WELL

04:26:42.186 --> 04:26:44.221
AND IS NOT INTENDED AS A TOOL TO

04:26:44.288 --> 04:26:45.756
TARGET PEOPLE IN POVERTY THE

04:26:45.823 --> 04:26:47.825
WHOLE POINT WAS TO PREVENT THAT

04:26:47.891 --> 04:26:48.892
. THE BEDROOMS I CAN QUOTE A

04:26:48.959 --> 04:26:51.261
BACKGROUND PAPER- IF YOU'D LIKE

UNABLE TO PROVIDE THEIR BASIC

04:26:53.997 --> 04:26:55.099
NEEDS AS A RESULT OF MENTAL

04:26:55.165 --> 04:26:56.800
ILLNESS OR CHRONIC ALCOHOLISM

04:26:56.867 --> 04:26:57.501
THEREFORE EXPERIENCING

04:26:57.568 --> 04:26:59.770
HOMELESSNESS OR FOOD INSECURITY

04:26:59.837 --> 04:27:00.904
DOES NOT MEET ANY. OF THIS

04:27:00.971 --> 04:27:03.073
CRITERIA. I KNOW THIS IS A

04:27:03.140 --> 04:27:04.508
DIFFICULT ISSUE WE'RE TALKING

OUR COUNTRY BUT WE ARE WALKING A

04:27:07.044 --> 04:27:08.946
LINE WITH FREEDOM TO MAKE

04:27:09.012 --> 04:27:10.280
DECISIONS WHETHER A PERSON HAS

04:27:10.347 --> 04:27:11.582
CAPACITY OR NOT. IS DENYING

04:27:11.648 --> 04:27:13.050
PEOPLE THEIR HEALTH THEIR

04:27:13.117 --> 04:27:15.919
DIGNITY AND IN SOME CASES THEIR

04:27:15.986 --> 04:27:18.122
LIVES. I WANT TO BE CLEAR

04:27:18.188 --> 04:27:19.256
INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT HAS SHOULD

04:27:19.323 --> 04:27:21.158
ALWAYS BE A LAST RESORT. I DON'T
