OVER OTHERS AND JUSTIFYING

00:11:36.796 --> 00:11:38.230
INTENTIONAL DISCRIMINATION.

00:11:38.297 --> 00:11:40.266
SO THAT I THINK IS THE

00:11:40.332 --> 00:11:41.734
DIFFICULTY I THINK THERE ARE

00:11:41.801 --> 00:11:43.169
OTHER THINGS WE CAN AND SHOULD

00:11:43.235 --> 00:11:44.537
DO TO ADDRESS THE EMPLOYMENT

00:11:44.603 --> 00:11:45.805
NEEDS OF OUR VETERANS BUT I

00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:47.606
DON'T THINK THIS IS A LIFE STEP.

VOEPEL GOOD TO SEE SIR THIS IS

00:12:13.833 --> 00:12:15.000
VERY SIMILAR TO PIECE OF

00:12:15.067 --> 00:12:16.168
LEGISLATION THAT YOU HAD IN THE

00:12:16.235 --> 00:12:18.104

POTENTIAL FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:12:25.611 --> 00:12:26.512
DESERVING OF THIS KIND OF

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:27.913
PREFERENCE TO NOT BE ABLE TO

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.115

YES SIR.

00:12:42.995 --> 00:12:44.096
THIS BILL TREATS ALL VETERANS

00:12:44.163 --> 00:12:45.030
EQUALLY [inaudible]

00:12:45.097 --> 00:12:49.034
AND I DON'T HAVE NUMBERS ON THE

00:12:49.101 --> 00:12:52.271
LGBT COMMUNITY IN THE MILITARY

00:12:52.338 --> 00:12:53.839
BECAUSE THEY DON'T TRACK IT.

00:12:53.906 --> 00:12:55.040
THEY TREAT EVERYONE IN THE

00:12:55.107 --> 00:12:57.977
MILITARY ABSOLUTELY EQUAL I DO

00:12:58.043 --> 00:12:59.378
HAVE NUMBERS IF I MAY.

00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:04.416
UM IN CALIFORNIA ONE THOUSAND

00:13:04.483 --> 00:13:05.050
SEVENTEEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED

00:13:05.117 --> 00:13:05.584
TWENTY NINE RECRUITS WERE

00:13:05.651 --> 00:13:06.552
RECRUITED ACROSS THE FIVE

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:08.821
BRANCHES IN.

00:13:08.888 --> 00:13:09.388
TWENTY SIXTEEN SO WE'RE NOT

00:13:09.455 --> 00:13:10.956
TALKING ABOUT A GIANT AMOUNT OF

00:13:11.023 --> 00:13:12.124
PEOPLE.

00:13:12.191 --> 00:13:14.193
WOMEN MAKE UP CURRENTLY IN THE

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:18.130
MILITARY 16218% AND GROWING.

00:13:18.197 --> 00:13:20.299
OKAY SO YOUR NUMBERS ARE A

00:13:20.366 --> 00:13:20.599
LITTLE BIT.

00:13:20.666 --> 00:13:24.737
OLD -- THEY ARE.

00:13:24.803 --> 00:13:27.306
COMPRISING 9% OF THE UNITED

00:13:27.373 --> 00:13:29.508
STATES VETERANS POPULATION BUT

00:13:29.575 --> 00:13:30.743
MUCH HIGHER IN THE STATE OF

00:13:30.809 --> 00:13:32.711
CALIFORNIA AMONG IN LISTED

00:13:32.778 --> 00:13:37.650
RECRUITS. 43% OF MEN AND 56% OF

00:13:37.716 --> 00:13:40.252
WOMEN ARE HISPANIC OR A RACIAL

00:13:40.319 --> 00:13:42.221
MINORITY.

00:13:42.288 --> 00:13:44.623
THAT'S HUGE THE MILITARY HAS

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:47.960
CHANGED IS CHANGE DRAMATICALLY

00:13:48.027 --> 00:13:49.962
AND WOMEN.

00:13:50.029 --> 00:13:52.831
ARE MUCH MORE DIVERSE THAN THE

00:13:52.898 --> 00:13:56.535
MEN SO IT IS PRETTY DRAMATIC AND

00:13:56.602 --> 00:13:58.938
I SEE WITHIN TEN YEARS WOMEN

00:13:59.004 --> 00:14:00.873
COMPRISE AT LEAST 30% OF THE

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.641
MILITARY ESPECIALLY AS WE GO

00:14:02.708 --> 00:14:05.444
INTO THE HIGH TECHNOLOGY AREAS.

00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:07.780
I KEEP TRYING.

00:14:07.846 --> 00:14:09.949
ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO GET NUMBERS

00:14:10.015 --> 00:14:13.319
ON LGBT Q. BECAUSE DON'T ASK

00:14:13.385 --> 00:14:14.820
DON'T TELL IS OVER.

00:14:14.887 --> 00:14:17.289
THE MILITARY'S OPEN THE ONLY

00:14:17.356 --> 00:14:18.157
THING THEY'RE NOT DOING NOW IS

00:14:18.224 --> 00:14:21.026
TRANS GENDER -- SURGERIES AND

00:14:21.093 --> 00:14:22.795
THAT MAY CHANGE VERY WELL IN THE

00:14:22.861 --> 00:14:25.397
FUTURE SO I WILL CONTINUE TO

00:14:25.464 --> 00:14:29.134
PURSUE THAT I'VE ALWAYS BEEN.

00:14:29.201 --> 00:14:31.403
CONFUSED WHY PEOPLE WOULD OPPOSE

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:33.973
THIS BILL AND ONE OF THE MAIN

00:14:34.039 --> 00:14:35.874
REASONS FOR THIS BILL.

00:14:35.941 --> 00:14:38.711
IS MOST OF THESE KIDS GRADUATED

00:14:38.777 --> 00:14:40.846
FROM HIGH SCHOOL.

00:14:40.913 --> 00:14:42.314
THEY DID THERE FOR YEARS THEY

00:14:42.381 --> 00:14:44.083
COME BACK FROM AFGHANISTAN I

00:14:44.149 --> 00:14:47.152
ROCK WHERE EVER WE SEND THEM.

00:14:47.219 --> 00:14:49.121
THEY GET OUT OF THE MILITARY.

00:14:49.188 --> 00:14:51.724
YOU GOT TO DO THREE THINGS FARO

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:53.759
AND IT'S SO IMPORTANT OTHERWISE

00:14:53.826 --> 00:14:56.495
THEY SLIDE OFF THE RADAR SCOPE

00:14:56.562 --> 00:14:58.697
NUMBER ONE THEY GOT TO GET A JOB.

00:14:58.764 --> 00:14:59.565
THEY DON'T GET A JOB THERE ARE

00:14:59.632 --> 00:15:01.267
DEEP TROUBLE.

00:15:01.333 --> 00:15:02.635
THEY NEED.

00:15:02.701 --> 00:15:04.103
TO GO TO SCHOOL USUALLY IT'S

00:15:04.169 --> 00:15:07.006
COMMUNITY COLLEGE WE HAVE FINE.

00:15:07.072 --> 00:15:08.340
COMMUNITY COLLEGE VETERAN

00:15:08.407 --> 00:15:10.242
PROGRAMS AND THEY GOT TO STAY

00:15:10.309 --> 00:15:13.379
OFF OF ABUSING DRUGS AND ALCOHOL

00:15:13.445 --> 00:15:15.514
IF THEY DO THOSE THREE THINGS.

00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:17.783
LIKE ME AS A VIETNAM VETERAN NAY

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:19.618
COULD BE SITTING HERE SOME DAY.

00:15:19.685 --> 00:15:21.820
OR SUCCESSFUL IN BUSINESS KEEP

00:15:21.887 --> 00:15:25.190
THEIR FAMILIES FIGHT PTSD UNLESS

00:15:25.257 --> 00:15:26.558
YOU BETTER IN THE MILITARY YOU

00:15:26.625 --> 00:15:28.360
DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO GET

00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:29.862
YOUR **** KICKED.

00:15:29.928 --> 00:15:31.430
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

00:15:31.497 --> 00:15:33.666
SO THAT'S I DON'T KNOW IF THAT

00:15:33.732 --> 00:15:35.367
ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION.

00:15:35.434 --> 00:15:36.235
AND THEN SOME.

00:15:36.302 --> 00:15:38.103
VIA AND I JUST FOR THAT FOR THE

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:39.571
RECORD BE CLEAR THAT --

00:15:39.638 --> 00:15:40.506
TRANSGENDER PEOPLE AMERICA

00:15:40.572 --> 00:15:42.374
AMERICANS CANNOT SERVE IN THE

00:15:42.441 --> 00:15:43.809
MILITARY GOV YOU KNOW KILEY

00:15:43.876 --> 00:15:45.277
OBVIOUSLY AND SO IT'S NOT THAT

00:15:45.344 --> 00:15:47.079
THE THAT OF MEDICAL PROCEDURES

00:15:47.146 --> 00:15:47.846
AND ALLOW IT'S JUST THERE'S

00:15:47.913 --> 00:15:48.981
ACTUAL SERVICE MILITARY NOT

00:15:49.048 --> 00:15:50.115
ALLOWED SO THAT.

00:15:50.182 --> 00:15:51.517
GETS COMPLICATED BUT I THINK THE

00:15:51.583 --> 00:15:53.352
PREVIOUSLY WERE SHOT EXTREME

00:15:53.419 --> 00:15:54.653
GOOD WILL AND TRYING TO BE

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.422
BROADLY INCLUSIVE OF FOLKS WHO

00:15:56.488 --> 00:15:58.123
HAD HAVE A DISH CHARGES THAT

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:00.192
WERE NOT HONORABLE NOT BECAUSE

00:16:00.259 --> 00:16:01.627
OF THEIR SERVICE BECAUSE OF WHO

00:16:01.694 --> 00:16:03.062
THEY WERE AND REFLECTION THE

00:16:03.128 --> 00:16:04.530
FACT ABOUT LAWS THAT CHANGE.

00:16:04.596 --> 00:16:06.031
AND I THINK THAT YOU'D STILL

00:16:06.098 --> 00:16:07.366
CONTINUE IN DENVER TO DO THAT

00:16:07.433 --> 00:16:08.634
WITH THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION.

00:16:08.701 --> 00:16:09.735
YEAH I THINK I WANT TO RAISE THE

00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:11.303
MENTION I THINK IT'S FAIR IS

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:12.705
THAT THERE IS PRO EXPRESSED

00:16:12.771 --> 00:16:13.939
PROHIBITION AGAINST

00:16:14.006 --> 00:16:15.407
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST VETERANS

00:16:15.474 --> 00:16:17.109
ARE THOSE WHO HAVE SERVED -- IN

00:16:17.176 --> 00:16:19.812
EMPLOYMENT -- CAN YOU EXPLAIN IN

00:16:19.878 --> 00:16:21.347
YOUR OWN WORDS WHY THAT'S NOT

00:16:21.413 --> 00:16:22.948
SUFFICIENT AND WHY THIS PIECE OF

00:16:23.015 --> 00:16:24.416
LEGISLATION IS REQUIRED TO GO

00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:25.884
BEYOND THAT EXPRESSED

00:16:25.951 --> 00:16:26.318
PROHIBITION AGAINST

00:16:26.385 --> 00:16:30.689
DISCRIMINATION TO NATIONAL

00:16:30.756 --> 00:16:31.623
PREFERENCE.

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:32.791
AT THE END OF THE DAY.

00:16:32.858 --> 00:16:33.625
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS BILL?

00:16:33.692 --> 00:16:36.695
IT WILL PROTECT THOSE EMPLOYERS

00:16:36.762 --> 00:16:38.831
THAT WANT TO VOLUNTARILY GIVE

00:16:38.897 --> 00:16:40.699
PREFERENCE TO VETERANS FROM

00:16:40.766 --> 00:16:41.767
BEING SUED.

00:16:41.834 --> 00:16:43.969
BY ANOTHER [inaudible]

00:16:44.036 --> 00:16:47.539
GROUP.

00:16:47.606 --> 00:16:49.775
THAT'S AT THE END OF THE DAY.

00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:52.511
SO THIS IS NOT ANY KIND OF A OF

00:16:52.578 --> 00:16:54.980
AGGRESSIVE WAY TO RECRUIT.

00:16:55.047 --> 00:16:56.949
VETERANS SIMPLY TO PROTECT THEM

00:16:57.015 --> 00:16:59.251
FROM A PROTECTED CLASS.

00:16:59.318 --> 00:17:01.787
GOING AFTER A IN THIS IS A VERY

00:17:01.854 --> 00:17:03.222
SMALL SUBSET.

00:17:03.288 --> 00:17:04.957
OF OUR POPULATION.

00:17:05.023 --> 00:17:06.692

UNDERSTAND THE ONE OF THE BEST

00:17:21.907 --> 00:17:22.908
THINGS WE NEED TO DO IS WORK

00:17:22.975 --> 00:17:24.743

WE START GIVING ALLOWING A

00:17:39.992 --> 00:17:42.261
VOLUNTARY PROGRAM -- FOR WOMEN

00:17:42.327 --> 00:17:43.762
IN ON ON REPRESENT UNDER

00:17:46.698 --> 00:17:48.033
THINK WE GO DOWN THE SLIPPERY

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.635
SLOPE -- SO WHAT KIND OF

00:17:49.701 --> 00:17:50.669
PRESIDENT DO YOU THINK THIS

00:17:50.736 --> 00:17:51.804
WOULD SET FOR OTHER PROTECTED

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:54.306
CLASSES IF WE WORSHIP TO DO THIS

00:17:54.373 --> 00:17:55.073
TODAY.

THEY'VE HAD NO PROBLEMS

00:18:00.879 --> 00:18:02.881
WHATSOEVER.

00:18:02.948 --> 00:18:04.716
SO THAT PARTICULAR THIS

00:18:04.783 --> 00:18:06.185
PARTICULAR SLIPPERY SLOPE

00:18:06.251 --> 00:18:07.820
DOESN'T EXIST IN THIRTY SEVEN

00:18:07.886 --> 00:18:09.188
STATES I DON'T SEE HOW

00:18:09.254 --> 00:18:16.695
CALIFORNIA WOULD BE DIFFERENT.

00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:17.930
RIGHT DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER

00:18:17.996 --> 00:18:19.465
QUESTIONS.
