00:28:10.488 --> 00:28:12.257
THE JOB DONE- IT'S A GREAT

00:28:12.323 --> 00:28:13.558
QUESTION AND ONE OF THE REASONS

00:28:13.625 --> 00:28:15.126
WHY WE LEFT. THE IMPLEMENTATION

00:28:15.193 --> 00:28:17.028
PROCESS I RECOGNIZE. PERSONAL I

00:28:17.095 --> 00:28:18.830
WANT TO THANK. MY COLLEAGUES-

00:28:18.897 --> 00:28:20.432
FOR THEIR COMMENTS AND FOR THE

00:28:20.498 --> 00:28:22.000
CONVERSATION I MEAN THIS IS AN

00:28:22.067 --> 00:28:23.234
IMPORTANT. IT'S IMPORTANT

00:28:23.301 --> 00:28:25.203
SUBJECT. WE LEFT IT BROAD

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:26.771
BECAUSE I RECOGNIZE THERE'S A

00:28:26.838 --> 00:28:28.606
DIFFERENCE. COUNTY TO COUNTY

00:28:28.673 --> 00:28:30.041
WITH THE SERVICES THAT ARE

00:28:30.108 --> 00:28:32.477
NECESSARY AND NEEDED- ONE SCHOOL

00:28:32.544 --> 00:28:33.878
MAY NEED A PHYSICAL SPACE

00:28:33.945 --> 00:28:35.180
BECAUSE THEY ALREADY HAVE.

00:28:35.246 --> 00:28:36.614
SUFFICIENT COUNSELORS AND OTHER

00:28:36.681 --> 00:28:39.150
SCHOOL MAY. NEED ONE TYPE OF

00:28:39.217 --> 00:28:40.885
ACUTE. HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS

00:28:40.952 --> 00:28:43.121
SO WE SORT OF CREATED A MENU. OF

00:28:43.188 --> 00:28:44.889
OPTIONS THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE

00:28:44.956 --> 00:28:47.459
UNDER THIS AND- WE THINK IN

00:28:47.525 --> 00:28:50.128
ORDER. TO MAKE. THE H. STRONG

00:28:50.195 --> 00:28:52.063
DIFFERENCE ON A CAMPUS. WE

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:53.731
NEEDED TO HAVE. SIGNIFICANT

00:28:53.798 --> 00:28:55.867
RESOURCES. HIGH SCHOOL BY HIGH

00:28:55.934 --> 00:28:57.502
SCHOOL SO THAT'S WHY. IN LOOKING

00:28:57.569 --> 00:28:59.737
AT THE NUMBERS WE THINK TWO

00:28:59.804 --> 00:29:00.338
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:29:00.405 --> 00:29:02.674
PER CAMPUS. WILL WILL DO. THE

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:05.710
JOB- WE'RE LOOKING AT A VERY-

00:29:05.777 --> 00:29:06.711
VARIOUS DIFFERENT FUNDING

00:29:06.778 --> 00:29:08.980
SOURCES- OBVIOUSLY THERE'S GOING

00:29:09.047 --> 00:29:10.815
TO BE DISCUSSED IN THE FISCAL

00:29:10.882 --> 00:29:12.350
COMMITTEE- BUT YOU ALSO

00:29:12.417 --> 00:29:17.255

THROUGH. THE PIPELINE AS

00:29:22.393 --> 00:29:23.161
POSSIBLE TO MEET THE NEEDS ON

00:29:23.228 --> 00:29:25.063
OUR CAMPUSES AND THERE'S A

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:26.164
NUMBER OF OTHER BILLS TO TRY TO

00:29:26.231 --> 00:29:27.799
STREAMLINE THAT PROCESS. BECAUSE

00:29:27.866 --> 00:29:29.634
THERE IS A RECOGNITION IN THE

00:29:29.701 --> 00:29:30.568
LEGISLATURE THAT WE HAVE TO GET

00:29:30.635 --> 00:29:32.704
PEOPLE THROUGH THE SYSTEM- WITH

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:33.304

BECAUSE THE NEED IS SO GREAT-

00:29:37.876 --> 00:29:39.511
THE BILL IS NOT ADDRESSING THAT

00:29:39.577 --> 00:29:41.012
PIECE BECAUSE OTHER LEGISLATION

00:29:41.079 --> 00:29:43.148
IS. BUT WE'RE TRYING TO BE BROAD

00:29:43.214 --> 00:29:44.682
ENOUGH AND FLEXIBLE ENOUGH. TO

00:29:44.749 --> 00:29:47.051
GIVE DISTRICTS THE ABILITY TO

00:29:47.118 --> 00:29:48.186

ON THAT LAST YEAR GIVING THE-

00:29:55.426 --> 00:29:57.362
ACTUAL TRAINING FOR TEACHERS TO

00:29:57.428 --> 00:30:00.732
IDENTIFY. WHERE THERE IS GOING

00:30:00.798 --> 00:30:03.134
TO- WHEN THEY- THE ACTUAL

00:30:03.201 --> 00:30:04.736
TRANSFERRED SO THEY CAN SEE IT

00:30:04.802 --> 00:30:06.337
BEFORE IT HAPPENS AND SO AND I

00:30:06.404 --> 00:30:08.339

THE ASSEMBLY LAST YEAR AND

00:30:09.908 --> 00:30:11.009
DIDN'T GET OUT AND SO. I'M

00:30:11.075 --> 00:30:12.777
HOPING THIS IS KIND OF ALONG

00:30:12.844 --> 00:30:14.312
THOSE LINES WERE WEAK WE CAN

00:30:14.379 --> 00:30:15.780
EDUCATE. YOU KNOW NOT ONLY THE

00:30:15.847 --> 00:30:18.116

THIS TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY WHEN

00:30:21.386 --> 00:30:23.154
THEY SEE A STUDENT THAT IS-

00:30:23.221 --> 00:30:24.822

IT COMES OUT BECAUSE I THINK

00:30:38.303 --> 00:30:39.370
THAT'S GOING TO BE THE IMPORTANT

00:30:39.437 --> 00:30:41.639
PART. OF HOW IT GETS IMPLEMENTED

00:30:41.706 --> 00:30:43.541
IN NOT JUST THE MONEY PART OF IT

00:30:43.608 --> 00:30:45.143

STABILITY OF THE PROGRAM MATTERS

00:30:56.688 --> 00:30:58.056

THAT STABILITY IN THE SERVICE

00:31:11.135 --> 00:31:12.937

CONCERNS ABOUT ON THIS BILL IS

00:41:14.705 --> 00:41:16.440
THE- IS THE INCREASE IN TUITION

00:41:16.507 --> 00:41:19.944

00:41:44.468 --> 00:41:45.002
JUSTIFICATION FOR THE FEE AND

00:41:45.069 --> 00:41:46.837
TUITION INCREASES AND WHY WE

00:41:46.904 --> 00:41:49.340
SHOULD DO THAT VERSUS THE REGION

00:41:49.406 --> 00:41:50.074
. I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:54.078
SENATOR- SO. THAT THE FETUS TO

00:41:54.144 --> 00:41:56.247
BE CLEAR THIS IS NOT REQUIRE OR

00:41:56.313 --> 00:41:57.381
CREATE A TUITION INCREASE OR FEE

00:41:57.448 --> 00:41:58.849
INCEASE. MY UNDERSTANDING IS

00:41:58.916 --> 00:42:01.252
THAT ALLOWS. THE PROGRAM TO GO

00:42:01.318 --> 00:42:02.887
UP TO A 5% INCREASE IN THE

00:42:02.953 --> 00:42:05.723
TUITION AND FEES- IN TWENTY

00:42:05.789 --> 00:42:07.858
TWENTY ONE THE TUITION WAS FOUR

00:42:07.925 --> 00:42:08.893
THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED THIRTY

00:42:08.959 --> 00:42:10.895
FOUR DOLLARS- AND THE- THIS IS A

00:42:10.961 --> 00:42:12.663
MODEST POTENTIAL INCREASE THAT-

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:15.165
WOULD ALLOW. THE PROGRAM TO

00:42:15.232 --> 00:42:17.334
CONTINUE. DEALING WITH THE

00:42:17.401 --> 00:42:20.237
RISING EXPENSES THAT I THINK-

00:42:20.304 --> 00:42:23.040
PROFESSOR- ONDECK JENSEN-

00:42:23.107 --> 00:42:24.608
MENTIONED EARLIER DUE TO BOTH

00:42:24.675 --> 00:42:26.110
INCREASING ENROLLMENT AS WELL AS

00:42:26.176 --> 00:42:28.245
THAT JUST RISING INFLATION THAT

00:42:28.312 --> 00:42:30.381
WE'RE EXPERIENCING- YEAH YOU

00:42:30.447 --> 00:42:32.616
KNOW AS FAR AS FEES NOT CREATE

00:42:32.683 --> 00:42:33.817
ONE THING IT'S JUST ABOUT THIS

00:42:33.884 --> 00:42:35.319
PROGRAM IS YOU KNOW IS THAT IT.

00:42:35.386 --> 00:42:37.087
IS AN OPTIONAL PROGRAM FOR HIGH

00:42:37.154 --> 00:42:38.555
SCHOOL STUDENTS IT'S NOT HI READ

00:42:38.622 --> 00:42:39.924
ITSELF IS NOT SOMETHING TO

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:40.824
IMPEACH ANY PATHWAYS

00:42:40.891 --> 00:42:43.694
NOTIFICATION- IN THERE ARE AS I

00:42:43.761 --> 00:42:44.428
UNDERSTAND IT SIGNIFICANT

00:42:44.495 --> 00:42:46.196
SCHOLARSHIPS AVAILABLE FOR THOSE

00:42:46.263 --> 00:42:47.932
WHO ARE IN NEED TO CAN

00:42:47.998 --> 00:42:49.333
DEMONSTRATE THAT SO. APART IS

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:51.068
THE CROSS SUBSIDIES THAT ACCRUE

00:42:51.135 --> 00:42:52.336
TO YOU KNOW STUDENTS THAT ARE.

00:42:52.403 --> 00:42:54.138
LOWER INCOME AND SO I THINK THE

00:42:54.204 --> 00:42:56.607
GOALS OF THIS PROGRAM IS YOU

00:42:56.674 --> 00:42:57.408
KNOW- WORTHWHILE- THE MODEST

00:42:57.474 --> 00:42:58.842
POTENTIAL FEE AND TUITION

00:42:58.909 --> 00:43:02.646
INCREASES HERE ARE MEANT TO BE

00:43:02.713 --> 00:43:04.048
CONTENT WITH THOSE GOALS. BUT I

00:43:04.114 --> 00:43:05.349
WOULD ALSO ALLOW. A TYLER OR-

00:43:05.416 --> 00:43:08.018
DOCTORS. AND A KANSEN IF YOU

00:43:08.085 --> 00:43:10.421
LIKE TO COME IN THIS WELL. THANK

00:43:10.487 --> 00:43:12.556
YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SO THE

00:43:12.623 --> 00:43:14.291
FEE INCREASE IS SIMPLY A PART OF

00:43:14.358 --> 00:43:16.126
THE NORMAL PROGRESSION OF HOW

00:43:16.193 --> 00:43:19.163
THINGS ARE AT. ON CAMPUS WILL TO

00:43:19.229 --> 00:43:21.899
EXPANDING THE PROGRAM V. THE

00:43:21.966 --> 00:43:24.068
LIMIT THAT'S BEING DISCUSSED

00:43:24.134 --> 00:43:26.470
HERE 25% LIMIT INCREASED FOR

00:43:26.537 --> 00:43:29.673
FROM HERE TO HERE. IS REALLY

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:31.709
ONLY PART OF THE PICTURE THE

00:43:31.775 --> 00:43:33.177
STATE FUNDS THAT GO IN AND

00:43:33.243 --> 00:43:35.279
SUPPORT THE PROGRAM A CONSTANT

00:43:35.346 --> 00:43:37.014
FROM YEAR TO YEAR IF YOU BREAK

00:43:37.081 --> 00:43:39.049
IT DOWN INTO OUR REVENUE

00:43:39.116 --> 00:43:41.085
INCREASE FROM YEAR TO YEAR WITH

00:43:41.151 --> 00:43:43.253
THIS FIVE PERCENT. MAXIMUM IT

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:45.122
ACTUALLY TRANSLATE TO A 3%

00:43:45.189 --> 00:43:46.991
MAXIMUM WHICH IS THE STANDARD.

00:43:47.057 --> 00:43:48.926
AT THE UNIVERSITY FOR GRANTS

00:43:48.993 --> 00:43:50.260
THAT WE COULD CALCULATE INTO

00:43:50.327 --> 00:43:52.229
MULTI YEAR GRANTS FROM YEAR TO

00:43:52.296 --> 00:43:54.531
YEAR INCREASE IN IN THE AMOUNT

00:43:54.598 --> 00:43:58.235
OF DOLLARS THAT- THAT IS

00:43:58.302 --> 00:43:59.403
EXPECTED TO BE SPENT ON THE

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:02.239
PROGRAM. I HAD SO- I DON'T

00:44:02.306 --> 00:44:03.807
DISPUTE ANY ISSUE THAT THE COST

00:44:03.874 --> 00:44:05.042
TO GO UP I'M JUST TRYING TO

00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:08.045
UNDERSTAND WHY- WE WOULD WANT TO

00:44:08.112 --> 00:44:09.980
SPEAK INTO THE SPACE OF ABOUT

00:44:10.047 --> 00:44:11.382
HOW MUCH WHEN THIS IS A REGION

00:44:11.448 --> 00:44:12.983
CHOICE. AND THIS IS THE

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:14.318
UNIVERSITY CHOICE AND THEIR

00:44:14.385 --> 00:44:15.386
BUDGET REQUESTS COME TO US EACH

00:44:15.452 --> 00:44:17.021
YEAR. TO FIND A VARIETY OF

00:44:17.087 --> 00:44:19.890
PROGRAMS THIS ONE. HAZARD WOULD

00:44:19.957 --> 00:44:22.393
BE INCLUDED IN THAT WHY WHY WHY

00:44:22.459 --> 00:44:24.228
IS IT BEING PULLED OUT IN THIS

00:44:24.294 --> 00:44:25.529
WAY. AND GIVEN OUR FINANCIAL

00:44:25.596 --> 00:44:27.464
CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE STATE IT'S

00:44:27.531 --> 00:44:28.999
AN UNCOMFORTABLE ISSUE FOR ME TO

00:44:29.066 --> 00:44:31.135
WANT TO RAISE TUITION AND FEES

00:44:31.201 --> 00:44:32.269
WE WERE EVEN A WORTHY PROGRAM

00:44:32.336 --> 00:44:33.837
LIKE THIS. WHEN THIS REALLY IS A

00:44:33.904 --> 00:44:35.372
CHOICE THE REGION'S CONNECTS SO

00:44:35.439 --> 00:44:36.907
AGAIN I GO BACK TO THE

00:44:36.974 --> 00:44:38.275
JURISDICTIONAL ISSUE. WHY SHOULD

00:44:38.342 --> 00:44:40.110
WE IN THE LEGISLATURE. THE

00:44:40.177 --> 00:44:41.345
SETTING AYE AYE AND AMOUNTS IN

00:44:41.412 --> 00:44:45.482
THIS BILL THIS WHERE. THE BILL

00:44:45.549 --> 00:44:46.984
THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET

00:44:47.051 --> 00:44:48.018
OUT HERE. DO YOU WANT YOUR LIKE

00:44:48.085 --> 00:44:50.954
YES IF I MAY SAY MEDIA NO SENT

00:44:51.021 --> 00:44:51.989
GLAZER AYE APPRECIATE THAT CON-

00:44:52.056 --> 00:44:53.090
YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT. IS NOT BEEN

00:44:53.157 --> 00:44:55.092
A PRIORITY FOR THE UC AND IN

00:44:55.159 --> 00:44:55.959
PARTICULAR FOR THIS YEAR IN

00:44:56.026 --> 00:44:57.961
TERMS OF THE REGION'S ASK- BUT I

00:44:58.028 --> 00:45:00.230
THINK IN GENERAL YOU KNOW WE BE

00:45:00.297 --> 00:45:01.598
OPEN TO HAVING CONVERSATIONS

00:45:01.665 --> 00:45:02.266
ABOUT THAT IN THE FUTURE- THIS

00:45:02.332 --> 00:45:03.801
IS LARGELY JUST. A PRIORITY OF

00:45:03.867 --> 00:45:05.436
TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT. IF

00:45:05.502 --> 00:45:06.937
COST TO INCREASE AND WHEN THEY

00:45:07.004 --> 00:45:08.939
DO INCREASE IN THE FUTURE. I

00:45:09.006 --> 00:45:10.140
WOULD NOTE THAT THERE IS A

00:45:10.207 --> 00:45:11.875
LITTLE BIT OF SAVINGS FROM COVE

00:45:11.942 --> 00:45:13.977
IN THE LAST TWO YEARS WOULD HAVE

00:45:14.044 --> 00:45:15.479
BEEN GREAT AND CAN BE. PUT

00:45:15.546 --> 00:45:16.180
TOWARDS MORE FINANCIAL

00:45:16.246 --> 00:45:17.247
ASSISTANCE AND CAN. HELP ME OUT

00:45:17.314 --> 00:45:19.316
HERE. BUT THE SAME TIME- THE

00:45:19.383 --> 00:45:21.618
ABILITY TO INCREASE IT 25% EACH

00:45:21.685 --> 00:45:23.253
YEAR- THAT'S THE THIRTY WERE

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:24.955
LOOKING FOR BUT I THINK EVERYONE

00:45:25.022 --> 00:45:26.623
HAVE A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:27.391
ABOUT. THE FUNDING PRIORITIES

00:45:27.458 --> 00:45:29.493
I'D BE HAPPY TO. TO TALK ABOUT

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:30.861
IF I COULD JUST INTERJECT YET

00:45:30.928 --> 00:45:33.063
THEN AND I WANT TO INTERJECT TO

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:34.198
SAY THAT THE TUITION AMOUNT IS

00:45:34.264 --> 00:45:36.166
ALREADY IN STATUTE. SO THIS

00:45:36.233 --> 00:45:37.668
ISN'T CHANGING WHAT'S IN STATUTE

00:45:37.734 --> 00:45:39.169
IF THAT HELPS YOU AT ALL. RIGHT

00:45:39.236 --> 00:45:40.704
BUT YOU'RE LEYVA WHAT I'M TRYING

00:45:40.771 --> 00:45:41.972
TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT THIS BILL

00:45:42.039 --> 00:45:43.807
WAS SILENT ON TUITION. OTHER

00:45:43.874 --> 00:45:45.042
REGIONS WITHOUT EVERYTHING IN

00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:46.210
THEIR POWER TO MAKE A CHOICE

00:45:46.276 --> 00:45:47.945
ABOUT HOW THEY FUND THE PROGRAM

00:45:48.011 --> 00:45:49.246
WITH THEIR REQUIRES FEE

00:45:49.313 --> 00:45:50.681
INCREASES ARE TUITION INCREASES.

00:45:50.747 --> 00:45:53.050
AS IS. THE CASE FOR. ALL

00:45:53.117 --> 00:45:54.184
UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE

00:45:54.251 --> 00:45:56.253
EDUCATION IN THE SYSTEM SO WHY

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:58.021
DO WE AS THE LEGISLATURE NEEDED.

00:45:58.088 --> 00:45:59.456
TO EVEN PUT THESE PARAMETERS NOT

00:45:59.523 --> 00:46:01.391
WHY IS THAT PART OF THIS BILL

00:46:01.458 --> 00:46:03.193
WHY IS IT NECESSARY I GUESS IF

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:04.061
IT DIFFERENTLY. I WANT TO

00:46:04.128 --> 00:46:05.662
SUPPORT EXPANDING AND IN THIS

00:46:05.729 --> 00:46:07.865
PROGRAM BUT- BUT WHYDO WE HAVE

00:46:07.931 --> 00:46:10.200
TO SPEAK PLAZA TO SPEAK TO THIS

00:46:10.267 --> 00:46:11.368
ISSUE OF TUITION AND FEES. OKAY

00:46:11.435 --> 00:46:12.436
AND I'M GONNA LET CENTER MEN

00:46:12.503 --> 00:46:14.171
ANSWER AND THEN I'M GONNA GO TO

00:46:14.238 --> 00:46:15.139
YOU SENATOR DOLLY AND PERHAPS

00:46:15.205 --> 00:46:17.141
TYLER CAN EXPAND ON THIS BUT MY

00:46:17.207 --> 00:46:18.842
UNDERSTANDING OF PROGRAM. IS

00:46:18.909 --> 00:46:20.444
THAT THIS IS. THIS PARTICULAR.

00:46:20.511 --> 00:46:22.312
METHOD OF- PROVIDING

00:46:22.379 --> 00:46:24.014
AUTHORIZATION RIKSBANK TUITION.

00:46:24.081 --> 00:46:25.215
IS CONSISTENT WITH HOW THE

00:46:25.282 --> 00:46:26.950
PROGRAM HAS BEEN FUNDED AND PASS

00:46:27.017 --> 00:46:28.185
AND- AS I THINK EITHER ALLUDED

00:46:28.252 --> 00:46:30.020
TO THIS IS NOT ACTUALLY. LISTED

00:46:30.087 --> 00:46:31.221
IS NOT A PRIORITY FOR THE UC

00:46:31.288 --> 00:46:33.056
REGENTS- AND I DON'T KNOW WHY

00:46:33.123 --> 00:46:35.025
THAT IS I DON'T KNOW. SO THIS IF

00:46:35.092 --> 00:46:36.793
WE WANT TO DO THIS OURSELVES-

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:37.861
YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS MY

00:46:37.928 --> 00:46:39.463
UNDERSTANDING THAT. CAN MATCH UP

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:41.632
WITH EXPECTED INCREASES OR

00:46:41.698 --> 00:46:42.633
POTENTIAL INCREASES IN COSTS AND

00:46:42.699 --> 00:46:49.940
INFLATION- THIS THIS IS GOING TO

00:46:50.007 --> 00:46:51.141
NOW WE COULD HAVE SCOTIAN. POSE

00:46:51.208 --> 00:46:53.410
HOC ABOUT WITH WE WANT TO CHANGE

00:46:53.477 --> 00:46:55.078
THE FUNDING- AND TAKE MORE CAN.

00:46:55.145 --> 00:46:56.346
AND I BE HAPPY TO HAVE THAT

00:46:56.413 --> 00:46:58.315
KIND. WE YOU AND YOUR STAFF- BUT

00:46:58.382 --> 00:47:00.017
BUT AT THIS POINT TIME THIS IS.

00:47:00.083 --> 00:47:01.985
I GUESS THIS IS THE STATUS QUO

00:47:02.052 --> 00:47:02.953
STAYING THE COURSE AS I

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:04.254
UNDERSTAND IT BUT TYLER IS THAT.

00:47:04.321 --> 00:47:05.255
CORRECT ARTICULATION. YEAH I

00:47:05.322 --> 00:47:06.957
MEAN SO YOU KNOW THIS BILL IS

00:47:07.024 --> 00:47:08.292
ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WITH THE

00:47:08.358 --> 00:47:08.959
PREVIOUS VERSION. EIGHTY SIX ONE

00:47:09.026 --> 00:47:11.128
SIX THAT WENT TO THE LEGISLATURE

00:47:11.195 --> 00:47:12.095
WHICH ESSENTIALLY JUST ASK FOR

00:47:12.162 --> 00:47:14.565
THE SAME. ALLOWABLE 5% IN THE

00:47:14.631 --> 00:47:15.332
SAME FIVE YEAR. REAUTHORIZATION

00:47:15.399 --> 00:47:15.933
ARE FOCUSED. WORST IS ON THE

00:47:15.999 --> 00:47:17.367
SUNSET EXTENSION GIVEN THAT

00:47:17.434 --> 00:47:18.769
BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE CREATED

00:47:18.835 --> 00:47:20.270
THE PROGRAM. WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:47:20.337 --> 00:47:21.872
THAT WE CONTINUE TO COME BACK TO

00:47:21.939 --> 00:47:23.340
YOU AND- HAVE THE CHANCE TO HAVE

00:47:23.407 --> 00:47:24.341
THIS CONVERSATION SO WE

00:47:24.408 --> 00:47:25.008
APPRECIATE THAT- BUT AT THIS

00:47:25.075 --> 00:47:27.110
POINT WE JUST LEAVE IT AT FIVE

00:47:27.177 --> 00:47:28.212
YEAR EXTENSION. SO IT'S

00:47:28.278 --> 00:47:29.213
UPDATING. THE LANGUAGE RATHER

00:47:29.279 --> 00:47:32.182
THAN RE WRITING THE LANGUAGE. SO

00:47:32.249 --> 00:47:33.684
IT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE BEFORE

00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:34.985
THIS IS AN EXTENSION OF THE

00:47:35.052 --> 00:47:36.019
PROGRAM- I UNDERSTAND THAT AND I

00:47:36.086 --> 00:47:38.255
THINK THAT I LOOK AT I WAS IN

00:47:38.322 --> 00:47:39.223
AROUND TWENTY YEARS AGO OR

00:47:39.289 --> 00:47:40.857
WHATEVER WAS ESTABLISHED BUT- MY

00:47:40.924 --> 00:47:41.925
GUESS IS THAT. THROUGH

00:47:41.992 --> 00:47:43.660
LEADERSHIP IN THE LEGISLATURE.

00:47:43.727 --> 00:47:45.429
AND THE DESIRE TO ADVANCE A

00:47:45.495 --> 00:47:47.831
PROGRAM LIKE THIS. THAT WE-

00:47:47.898 --> 00:47:50.000
PASSED A LOT OF DUE TO. THE TO

00:47:50.067 --> 00:47:52.135
THE REGIONS THIS MAY NOT BE A

00:47:52.202 --> 00:47:53.737
PRIORITY TO YOU BUT IT'S A

00:47:53.804 --> 00:47:55.005
PRIORITY TO US. SO IT IS A

00:47:55.072 --> 00:47:56.974
LITTLE CURIOUS AT THIS POINT IN

00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.609
TIME IT'S THAT YOU CAN CREDIBLY

00:47:58.675 --> 00:48:00.210
SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM. WHY WE HAVE

00:48:00.277 --> 00:48:02.079
TO DO THAT ANYMORE I MEAN I. YOU

00:48:02.145 --> 00:48:03.347
TALK ABOUT A FIVE YEAR EXTENSION

00:48:03.413 --> 00:48:04.848
I RATHER ELIMINATE- THE AND THE

00:48:04.915 --> 00:48:05.949
US SUNSET ON IT THE PROGRAM

00:48:06.016 --> 00:48:07.985
STAYS IN EFFECT FOREVER. BUT I

00:48:08.051 --> 00:48:09.920
WHAT'S BAFFLING TO ME IS THAT

00:48:09.987 --> 00:48:11.321
THIS IS A REALLY A WORKAROUND OF

00:48:11.388 --> 00:48:12.155
OUR BUDGET PROCESS I'M

00:48:12.222 --> 00:48:14.124
INCREDIBLY SUPPORTIVE OF OUR- OF

00:48:14.191 --> 00:48:15.759
OUR UC EDUCATION I THINK W

00:48:15.826 --> 00:48:17.094
OUGHT TO GIVE THEM A LOT MORE

00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:19.062
MONEY THAN THEY'VE BEEN GETTING.

00:48:19.129 --> 00:48:19.997
AND THEY GET TO SET THE

00:48:20.063 --> 00:48:21.765
PRIORITIES IF THIS IS A SELF

00:48:21.832 --> 00:48:23.133
SUSTAINING PROGRAM WHICH I THINK

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.968
THE CLAIM IS THAT IT IS. WHY

00:48:25.035 --> 00:48:26.136
WOULD THE REGION'S EVER OBJECT.

00:48:26.203 --> 00:48:27.804

00:48:27.871 --> 00:48:29.773
THIS FORM OR WHATEVER FORM OF

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:31.241
THEIR WISDOM AND IT'S AGAIN. WHY

00:48:31.308 --> 00:48:33.143
SB AS A LEGISLATOR VOTING FOR A

00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:34.444

HEAR THE SENATOR BRING UP AND I

00:50:18.982 --> 00:50:19.916

REGULAR PROCESS AND THAT WAY WE

00:50:38.935 --> 00:50:40.070
WOULD BE RAISING TUITION. JUST

00:50:40.137 --> 00:50:42.105

IS SO MUCH NEEDED TODAY'S TIME

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:18.208
SO. I'M NOT SURE THAT COULD ALSO

00:51:18.275 --> 00:51:20.877
BE AN AMENDMENT ON THAT END. IF

00:51:20.944 --> 00:51:22.913

NOW IS THAT IT. IS TALKS ABOUT

00:51:32.189 --> 00:51:34.825

OUTSIDE ORGANIZATION. NON

DESIRE TO DO THAT- IN IT WE HAVE

00:54:07.344 --> 00:54:08.511
WHAT I WOULD DESCRIBE AS MASSIVE

00:54:08.578 --> 00:54:09.813
AMOUNTS OF THESE KIND OF

00:54:09.879 --> 00:54:11.414

01:01:22.345 --> 01:01:23.880
REALIZED THAT EVEN WITH NO PRIOR

01:01:23.946 --> 01:01:25.515
EXPERIENCE AT ALL MY VOICE AND

01:01:25.581 --> 01:01:26.949
INPUT HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT

01:01:27.016 --> 01:01:28.985
ON A HELICOPTER I BELIEVE THAT

01:01:29.052 --> 01:01:30.453
STUDENT INPUT IS THE SOLUTION TO

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:31.954

THE STUDENT PERSPECTIVE IS MORE

01:01:44.367 --> 01:01:46.202
THAN JUST ONE MORE VOICE IN THE

01:01:46.269 --> 01:01:47.870

01:01:50.706 --> 01:01:52.008
I THINK I CAN NOT BE MEASURED

WITH NUMBERS AND CANNOT BE

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:55.244
