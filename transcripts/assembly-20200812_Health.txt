BUT WE WILL GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED A SENATOR PAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO PRESENT YOUR BILL. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH- CHAIR WOULD AND THE MEMBERS OF THE YOU KNOW I THINK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT. SB EIGHT FIFTY TWO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED ON PAGE EIGHT OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. SB EIGHT FIFTY TWO. IS A BILL THAT REQUIRES THE STATE TO CONTRACT OUR THE PARTNER. TO MANUFACTURE AT LEAST TEN GENERIC DRUGS INCLUDING INSULIN WHAT THE INTENT THAT THESE DRUGS BE MADE WIDELY AVAILABLE. NOW THE ADMINISTRATION AND THIS LEGISLATURE HAS WORKED HARD OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF PHARMACEUTICAL. COSTS IS IN THE SENATE CENTER HERNANDEZ HAD AUTHORED A BILL THAT'S NOW LAW TO TRACK THE PRICING AND THEN I KNOW TAT- SUMMER WOULD IN THIS COMMITTEE HAS ALSO PUT FORTH A LEGISLATION AS WELL AS LAST YEAR WE WORKED ON AND AG BILL YOU. AUTHORED AG BILLS I SURE WOULD- TO ADDRESS- ACTUALLY GENERICS AND THAT THE COSTA GENERICS THEMSELVES AND THAT DOES NOW ALSO I WANT THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP THERE AND BELIEVES THAT THIS COMMITTEE AND THAT LEGISLATION OTHER LEGISLATION. THE GOVERNOR'S WELLS- AND YOU KNOW AND THROUGH THE BUDGET AND THROUGH THE LEGISLATION ALSO HAS A BROADER VARIETY MEASURES TO TRY TO ADDRESS AGAIN PHARMACEUTICAL PRICING- FACT THIS YEAR- THE- GOVERNOR PROPOSED IN HIS JANUARY BUDGET- THAT- THE STATE CONSIDER ACTUALLY MANUFACTURING ITS OWN MEDICATIONS. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT- MY OFFICE AND SO WHEN THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED THAT WE FELT THAT IT WOULD BE MOST APPROPRIATE NOT TO JUST DO THAT THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS BUT ACTUALLY THROUGH THE POLICY PROCESS SO WE CAN THOROUGHLY THAT THE- ISSUE AND SO. I THAT'S WHY I AUTHORED A MOCKERY SB EIGHT FIFTY TWO SO THAT WE HAVE A POLICY VETTING OF THIS ISSUE- THE STATE IN THE CAR. FOR ARMY. ITS OWN GEN. MEDICATIONS THOUSAND THAT JAN BUDGET WE'VE HAD TO OVERCOME. AND WHILE IT WAS PART OF THE NAY VICE PACKAGE PARTLY BECAUSE IT WE DID HOLD IT AS A AS A POLICY ISSUE. IS STILL ONE I THINK HAS PARTICULAR RESONANCE GIVEN. A KOBE. SO WE COME TO JERRY MEDICATIONS ACTUALLY TWO ISSUES ONE IS OF COURSE THE COST ISSUE. THE OTHER ISSUES ALSO- READY SUPPLY AS WELL SO WE KNOW THE GENERIC SPACE EVEN WITHOUT CREE COVE IT. THERE ARE CERTAIN GENERIC MEDICATIONS AND WHICH WE COULDN'T GET RELIABLE SUPPLY. WE ALSO KNOW DOOR OTHER GENERIC MEDICATIONS WOULD OR MIGHT BE JUST A SINGLE MANUFACTURE AND IN FACT PERHAPS AN INVESTOR WOULD COME AND- BY THAT SINGLE MANUFACTURE AND THEN RAISE ITS PRICES AWAY TO. MAXIMIZE THEIR PROFITS. AND CAUSING PRICE SPIKES. AND THEN OF COURSE WE ALSO KNOW THERE'S OTHER GENERICS IN WHICH- THERE IS OPPORTUNITY FOR- WHERE BASICALLY THE PRICE JUST KEEPS RISING AND THERE'S A NARROW NUMBER OF MANUFACTURE SO BY. INCLUDING A- THE STATE IS ESSENTIALLY A- EITHER A DIRECT MANUFACTURER OR A CONTRACT TO MANUFACTURE. THAT WOULD HELP BUILD STABILIZE PRICE AND SUPPLY IN ITS ACT ACTUALLY ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR- THERE'S AN OLD CALLED CIVIC OF COMPOSED OF HOSPITALS AND HEALTH PLANS THAT IS TRYING TO. DO JUST THAT AND CERTAINLY WE'VE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED. WITH CIVICA AS WELL WITHOUT BEING SURE THAT WE CAN WE HAVE A RELIABLE AND- LOW COST. GENERIC MEDICATION SINCE. ARE WE WORKING WITH GOVERNORS. WELL DEVELOPING THIS BUT LIKE JUST I WOULD KNOW DURING WE ARE FOR CHEN. WITH SUPPLIED. WHETHER IT'S TESTING PP AND EVEN MEDICATION BY THE WAY SO- UNFORTUNATELY WE- HAVE NOT SEEN THE SHORTAGES THAT SOME OF THE OTHER STATES HAVE SEEN THAT WORD HOSPITALS WOULD OVERWHELM THE WORD NOT ONLY FOR THE SHORT PP. YOUR SHORT OF THE VERY MEDICATIONS PEOPLE NEED TO GET TREATED FOR OUR TO BE INNOVATIVE FOR. A COVETED. AND SO THIS IS GONNA BE A VERY IMPORTANT STEP TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. TO LOOK AT BOTH HOW DO WE ASSURE A STABLE. AND THE LOW COST COST EFFECTIVE SUPPLY OF GENERIC MEDICATION. AND ALSO TO ENSURE THAT WE ALSO HAVE THE EXPERTISE IN SUPPLY CHAIN NECESSARY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF DURING. CRISIS. LIKE OCTOBER NINETEEN. YOU KNOW I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT WELL HIGH TO CLERK WHEN HIS UNFORTUNATELY NOT PROVEN TO BE AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR COVERED WHEN IT WAS BEING CONSIDERED- WE ACTUALLY HAD SHORTAGES NOT JUST FOR PEOPLE TO COME OF IT BUT DIRECTLY PEOPLE WHO DO NEED IT FOR THAT'S EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR LUPUS ARTHRITIS. AND SO- THIS BILL. CONTINUES TO MOVE THIS CONVERSATION FORWARD GIVES THE- MINISTRATION THE OPPORTUNITYBUT ALSO ENSURES THAT LEGISLATION INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS POLICY. SO WE CAN AGAIN GET AHEAD OF THE PROBLEM INSTEAD OF COSTLY TRYING TO PLAY CATCH UP- I. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND I HAVE- TWO WITNESSES AND SUPPORTS THEIR FLOCKS IN THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AND YASMIN PALETTE FROM THE- FROM HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. OF THIS. IMPORTANT MEASURE AS A COMPONENT OF OUR- A COMBINED EFFORT TO DRESS- PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS THANKS VERY MUCH. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF BEFORE WE GO TO OUR WITNESSES WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE OUR OUR SO. TAKE ROLE WE DO HAVE A LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE QUORUM. SO ALL HAVE HER DO THAT FIRST. AND I WOULD JUST RECOGNIZE ALSO WE HAVE A MOTION BY MISTER YEAR KOREA SECOND BY MISS CARILLO SO MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. WHAT HERE. WOULD HERE MAYES. MAYES HERE AGUIAR-CURRY. AGUIAR-CURRY HERE BIGELOW. BIGELOW HERE BONTA. BONTA HERE BURKE. BURKE HERE CARILLO. CARILLO HERE FLORA LIMóN MCCARTY NAZARIAN RAMOS RAMOS HERE RODRIGUEZ SANTIAGO SAN DIEGO HERE WALDRON. YOU HAVE A QUORUM. SO OF MATTER MARK- I. IS IT APPROACH THE MATTER MEMBER MISTER MODERATOR MODERATOR PLEASE- ALLOW OPEN THE LINES FOR OUR PRIMARY WITNESSES TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU DON'T WANT ARE OPEN. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF GOOD MORNING THIS IS SERRA FLAGS O. DE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND WE ARE HERE BECAUSE EVERY DOLLAR THAT'S SPENT ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IS A DOLLAR THAT COMES OUT OF A WORKER'S POCKET. AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ARE THE FASTEST GROWING COST DRIVER AND IN HEALTHCARE SPENDING AND IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR COULD GET ON DRUGS. CALPERS REPORTS AT APPROXIMATELY 26% OF THEIR TOTAL BY. ON TOTAL HEALTHCARE IS FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. ONE STRATEGY THAT OUR UNION TRUST FUNDS IN OUR EMPLOYERS HAVE USED FOR CONTROLLING DRUG SPENDING OVER THE YEARS IS ENSURING THAT MEMBERS USE GENERIC VERSIONS OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS WHATEVER MEDICALLY FEASIBLE. OVER THE RISING COST OF DRUGS BOTTOM WITH NO CLEAR EXPLANATION DRIVE UP COSTS FOR EMPLOYERS WORKERS AND CONSUMERS. GENERIC DRUGS WHICH ONES WERE ARE LOWER COST OPTIONS ARE STARTING SKYROCKET. THE RECENT QUARTERLY A SEVEN REPORT ON DRUG PRICES SHOW THAT GENERIC DRUGS HAD A MEDIAN INCREASE OF THIRTY SEVEN POINT COMPARED TO A TWENTY FIVE POINT OVERALL. SOME EXAMPLES OF THOSE INCREASES ARE THAT THE PRICE OF A GENERIC LIQUID VERSION OF PROZAC. PROZAC WHICH- IS THIRTY FIRST MOST PRESCRIBED DRUG NATIONALLY WITH TWO POINT ONE MILLION PRESCRIPTION. THAT INCREASED SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN CENTS. IN PRICE IN TWENTY NINETEEN. EACH EACH JEEP. I TEN INCREASE IN PRICE MORE THAN TO TAKE STEPS TO BE ON TRANSPARENCY TO FIX THE PENSIONARY CARE ACT MARKET. ALL CALIFORNIANS NEED A RELIABLE AFFORDABLE GENERIC DRUGS SUPPLIED TO KEEP US HEALTHY. SO CALIFORNIA IS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD IT'S HOME TO SOME OF THE GREATEST SCIENCE IN MEDICAL UNIVERSITIES IN THE COUNTRY SOME OF THE MOST INNOVATIVE DRUG MANUFACTURERS IN THE WORLD ARE HEADQUARTERED HERE ALREADY. WE ALSO HAVE A HUGE NUMBER OF CONSUMERS INCLUDING HOSPITALS AND CLINICS AND THAT WOULD FORCE MANUFACTURERS TO HAVE TO COMPETE FOR A MARKET. THIS STATE IS WELL POSITIONED TO START OUR OWN GENERICALLY LABELED TO HELP LOWER PRICES IN A VERY TARGETED WAY- AND TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY FOR EVERYONE AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE HAVE HEARD YOUR SUPPORT SB EAT BACK TO. THANK YOU. AND OUR NEXT WITNESS. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND NUMBERS YES MEAN PALETTE ON BEHALF OF HEALTHAXIS CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION WE ARE HERE TODAY AND STRONG SUPPORT OF SB EIGHT FIVE TWO TO CREATE THE OFFICE OF DRUG CONTRACTING AND MANUFACTURING. CONSUMERS STILL STRUGGLE TO ACCESS AND AFFORD THEIR NEEDED MEDICATIONS ACROSS ALL SEGMENTS THE PHARMACEUTICAL BRAND NAME GENERIC SPECIALTY WE SEE PRICES RISING AROUND 90% OF ALL PRESCRIPTIONS ARE GENERIC AND 40% OF ALL GENERIC MEDICINE ARE MADE BY A SINGLE PENNY FACTOR ALLOWING THAT MANY FACTOR TO HIKE PRICES WITHOUT COMPETITION. ITS CONTROL ULTIMATELY MEANS BECOMES PAY. FOR JUST MEDICATIONS THAT MEASURE. IN SOME CASES SINGLE MANUFACTURER HAS DRIVEN UP THE PRICE OF WALKED AT THE- DRUG BY ASTONISHING ABOUT. I CREATE THIS OFFICE THEY COULD PROVIDE RELIEF TO MILLIONS OF CAL. STRUGGLING WITHOUT COST PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR COMPETITION IN THE MANUFACTURING. IN ADDITION TO SAVING COSTS FOR CONSUMERS THE OFFICE HAS THE CAPACITY TO STATE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY. THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE BOOK TODAY.
