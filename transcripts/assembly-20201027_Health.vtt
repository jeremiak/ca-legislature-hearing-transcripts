TH CASE OF HOSPITAL CARE

00:35:19.283 --> 00:35:20.451
CALIFORNIA WHAT WE SEE IS

00:35:20.518 --> 00:35:22.487
PRICES INCREASED NOT ONLY TO

00:35:22.553 --> 00:35:24.856

00:35:38.903 --> 00:35:39.604
WHY ARE PRICES INCREASING SO

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:41.506
QUICKLY THERE'S AT LEAST TWO

00:35:41.572 --> 00:35:43.274
FACTORS THAT ARE DRIVING

00:35:43.341 --> 00:35:44.208
HOSPITAL PRICE INCREASES IN

00:35:44.275 --> 00:35:46.043
CALIFORNIA. ONE IS THE

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:47.211
INCREASED CONSOLIDATION OF

00:35:47.278 --> 00:35:48.779
HOSPITALS INTO MULTI HOSPITAL

00:35:48.846 --> 00:35:50.681
SYSTEMS THAT CAN ACCUMULATE

00:35:50.748 --> 00:35:52.850
MARKET POWER. AND RAPIDLY

00:35:52.917 --> 00:35:54.919

00:36:07.164 --> 00:36:09.333
THE GRAPH IS THEIR GRAPH ON

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:12.303
THAT SLIDE YES YES. I'M HOPING

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:13.971
THAT THERE IS THIS IS ONE OF MY

00:36:14.038 --> 00:36:15.640
FAVORITES LICENSE IT PROVIDES

00:36:15.706 --> 00:36:17.208
EVIDENCE THAT COMPETITION CAN

00:36:17.275 --> 00:36:19.210
WORK THERE WE GO CAN WORK IN

00:36:19.277 --> 00:36:21.212
HEALTH CARE. WHEN MARKETS ARE

00:36:21.279 --> 00:36:23.481
COMPETITIVE. THE DATA ON THIS

00:36:23.548 --> 00:36:25.416
SLIDE TRACK HOSPITAL PRICES PER

00:36:25.483 --> 00:36:28.986
DAY THE BLUE BARS BETWEEN

00:36:29.053 --> 00:36:30.054
NINETEEN NINETY FIVE IN TWENTY

00:36:30.121 --> 00:36:32.690
SIXTEEN FOR COMMERCIALLY SHORT

00:36:32.757 --> 00:36:33.524
PATIENTS IN CALIFORNIA. IF YOU

00:36:33.591 --> 00:36:35.092
LOOK TO THE EARLY YEARS WHICH

00:36:35.159 --> 00:36:36.561
ARE ON THE LOWER LEFT HAND SIDE

00:36:36.627 --> 00:36:38.162
THE BLUE BARS YOU CAN SEE

00:36:38.229 --> 00:36:40.464
PRICES WERE LOWER IN NINETEEN

00:36:40.531 --> 00:36:43.734
NINETY FIVE. BUT ALSO THEY WERE

00:36:43.801 --> 00:36:45.603
LOWER IN THE NINETY SIX NINETY

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:47.371
SEVEN AND NINETY EIGHT PRICES

00:36:47.438 --> 00:36:49.140
WERE ACTUALLY GOING DOWN. IN

00:36:49.206 --> 00:36:51.475
CALIFORNIA. THIS IS WHEN

00:36:51.542 --> 00:36:52.109
COMPARED MARKETS WERE

00:36:52.176 --> 00:36:54.312
COMPETITIVE. THEN WE SEE THIS

00:36:54.378 --> 00:36:56.447
TREND RE BEGIN TO REVERSE AND

00:36:56.514 --> 00:36:58.249
PRICES IN HOSPITALS GROW

00:36:58.316 --> 00:37:01.118
RAPIDLY. AS I MENTIONED THERE'S

00:37:01.185 --> 00:37:02.353
TWO SETS OF FACTORS THAT ARE

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:04.989
DRIVING THIS CALIFORNIA IN

00:37:05.056 --> 00:37:06.657
EARLY TWO THOUSANDS ADOPTED

00:37:06.724 --> 00:37:09.026
PRUDENT LAYPERSON RULES. THAT

00:37:09.093 --> 00:37:10.761
INCREASED UTILIZATION OF

00:37:10.828 --> 00:37:12.496
HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS

00:37:12.563 --> 00:37:14.332
AND MANDATED THAT HEALTH PLANS

00:37:14.398 --> 00:37:16.334

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:19.136
EMERGENCY CARE. IN ADDITION

00:37:19.203 --> 00:37:20.605
MORE AND MORE HOSPITALS WERE

00:37:20.671 --> 00:37:22.607
JOINING MULTI HOSPITAL SYSTEMS

00:37:22.673 --> 00:37:24.675
AND MORE OF THOSE SYSTEMS WERE

00:37:24.742 --> 00:37:27.778
DEMANDING ALL LEARN CONTRACTS.

00:37:27.845 --> 00:37:29.847
REFLECTING INCREASED MARKET

00:37:29.914 --> 00:37:34.285
POWER NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THIS

00:37:34.352 --> 00:37:38.222
NEXT SLIDE. THE LINE GRAPH

00:37:38.289 --> 00:37:40.825
SHOWS INCREASES IN BILL CHARGES

00:37:40.891 --> 00:37:42.893
OVER TIME AND YOU COULD SEE IN

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.495
THE EARLY PERIOD BILL CHARGES

00:37:44.562 --> 00:37:46.664
PER DAY WERE GOING UP SLIGHTLY

00:37:46.731 --> 00:37:47.999
AND THEN THEY STARTED TO

00:37:48.065 --> 00:37:50.001
ACCELERATE AND EXPLODED. ALL

00:37:50.067 --> 00:37:52.470
RIGHT THIS REFLECTS HOSPITALS

00:37:52.536 --> 00:37:54.472
RAISING THEIR BILL CHARGES AS

00:37:54.538 --> 00:37:57.541
THE DEFAULT PRICE FOR OUT OF

00:37:57.608 --> 00:37:59.310
NETWORK EMERGENCY CARE. THESE

00:37:59.377 --> 00:38:01.612
THESE BILL CHARGES BECAUSE THEY

00:38:01.679 --> 00:38:04.515
WENT UP SO QUICKLY. REYES THE

00:38:04.582 --> 00:38:05.983
IN NETWORK PRICES WHICH OF THE

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:07.685
BLUE BARS AND SO THERE'S A

00:38:07.752 --> 00:38:09.754
DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN THE

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:11.389
ABILITY OF HOSPITALS TO RAISE

00:38:11.455 --> 00:38:12.923
THEIR BILL CHARGES AND TO

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:14.458
DEMAND THOSE PRESS AS OUT OF

00:38:14.525 --> 00:38:16.994
NETWORK PRICES THOSE DROVE IN

00:38:17.061 --> 00:38:18.996
NETWORK PRICES HIGHER AND ARE

00:38:19.063 --> 00:38:21.832
MAJOR FACTORS DRIVING INCREASE

00:38:21.899 --> 00:38:23.501
HOSPITAL PRICES IN CALIFORNIA.

00:38:23.567 --> 00:38:29.407

00:38:44.221 --> 00:38:46.323
THE BLUE LINE. THE GREEN LINE

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:47.792
AT THE BOTTOM IS THE DIFFERENCE

00:38:47.858 --> 00:38:48.592
BETWEEN THOSE TWO GROUPS OF

00:38:48.659 --> 00:38:50.327
HOSPITALS IF YOU LOOK TO THE

00:38:50.394 --> 00:38:51.829
LOWER LEFT HAND CORNER YOU CAN

00:38:51.896 --> 00:38:54.432
SEE THE PRICES IN THOSE TWO

00:38:54.498 --> 00:38:55.166
GROUPS OF HOSPITALS WERE ABOUT

00:38:55.232 --> 00:38:57.468
THE SAME. THEN BEGINNING IN

00:38:57.535 --> 00:38:59.837
EARLY TWO THOUSAND ONE HOSPITAL

00:38:59.904 --> 00:39:01.472
STARTED TO DEMAND ALL OUR NON

00:39:03.274 --> 00:39:05.276
THESE TWO SYSTEMS- STARTED THAT

00:39:05.342 --> 00:39:07.211
PRACTICE AROUND THEN. WE SEE

00:39:07.278 --> 00:39:08.946
THE PRICES START TO GROW FASTER

00:39:09.013 --> 00:39:10.581
THAN THE REST OF HOSPITALS IN

00:39:10.648 --> 00:39:12.550
THE MARKET. AND CONTINUE TO

00:39:12.616 --> 00:39:14.919
GROW AND NOW YOU CAN SEE ON THE

00:39:14.985 --> 00:39:16.887
LOWER RIGHT HAND SIDE THE GAP.

00:39:16.954 --> 00:39:18.189
BETWEEN THOSE TWO GROUPS

00:39:18.255 --> 00:39:19.990
HOSPITALS IS ALMOST SEVEN

00:39:20.057 --> 00:39:21.959
THOUSAND DOLLARS. BILL CHARGES

AS WELL. AND WE'VE DONE

00:39:52.256 --> 00:39:54.692
ADDITIONAL ANALYSES.

00:39:54.759 --> 00:39:56.360

00:40:25.523 --> 00:40:28.192
COMPARES UTILIZATION IT DIDN'T

00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:30.361
SEEM TO AND TWENTY TWENTY

PERIOD IN TWENTY NINETEEN. AND

00:40:33.764 --> 00:40:36.267
AS YOU CAN SEE VOLUME DROPPED

00:40:36.333 --> 00:40:37.601
SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE EARLY

00:40:37.668 --> 00:40:40.204
PERIOD OF COVE IT HAS REBOUNDED

00:40:40.271 --> 00:40:42.306
BUT IS STILL WELL BELOW PRE

EDIE VISITS ARE RUNNING ABOUT

00:40:49.613 --> 00:40:51.515
TWENTY PERCENT. BELOW SO

00:40:51.582 --> 00:40:53.484
HOSPITALS HAVE LOST MONEY

00:40:53.551 --> 00:40:55.085
DURING THIS TIME PERIOD WELL

00:40:55.152 --> 00:40:56.520
THEY DID GET SOME FUNDING FROM

00:40:56.587 --> 00:40:58.155
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WERE

00:40:58.222 --> 00:40:59.223
ABLE TO CUT SOME OF THEIR

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:01.759

00:41:01.826 --> 00:41:04.028
MONEY DURING THIS TIME PERIOD.

00:41:04.094 --> 00:41:05.896
ONE CONCERN IS ARE THEY LIKELY

00:41:05.963 --> 00:41:07.631
TO LOOK FOR PRICE INCREASES

00:41:07.698 --> 00:41:09.433
WHEN THEIR CONTRACTS EXPIRE TO

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:11.335
MAKE UP THESE LOSSES AND WHAT

00:41:11.402 --> 00:41:12.837
DO THEY HAVE THE MARKET POWER

00:41:12.903 --> 00:41:14.672
TO MAKE THOSE PRICE INCREASES

00:41:14.738 --> 00:41:20.277
STICK. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. RIGHT

00:41:20.344 --> 00:41:21.412

00:44:57.861 --> 00:44:59.263
FOUNDATION SPONSORED A SURVEY

00:44:59.329 --> 00:45:00.898
THAT FOUND THAT MORE THAN TWO

00:45:00.964 --> 00:45:02.599
THIRDS OF CALIFORNIA ADULTS

00:45:02.666 --> 00:45:04.234

00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:16.647
PERCENTAGE. THAN THAT 54% HE

00:45:16.713 --> 00:45:18.248

WORRIED ABOUT AFFORDING THEIR

00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:22.486

CONCERNS ARE EVEN MORE COMMON

00:45:54.351 --> 00:45:56.987

FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL WERE MORE

00:46:17.407 --> 00:46:18.909
LIKELY TO WORRY ABOUT HEALTH

00:46:18.976 --> 00:46:21.245
CARE AFFORDABILITY THAN THEIR

CONCERNS HAVE FINANCIAL

00:47:01.351 --> 00:47:04.021
CONSEQUENCES SUCH AS A PEOPLE

00:47:04.087 --> 00:47:05.455
CUTTING BACK ON OTHER BASIC

BANKRUPTCY. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.

00:47:15.999 --> 00:47:17.301
HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY IS AN

00:47:17.367 --> 00:47:18.936
ISSUE THAT AFFECTS NEARLY ALL

00:47:19.002 --> 00:47:21.305
CALIFORNIANS BUT TODAY MAY

00:47:21.371 --> 00:47:23.640
PRESENTATION WILL MOSTLY FOCUS

00:47:23.707 --> 00:47:25.609
ON THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA

00:47:25.676 --> 00:47:27.311
ADULTS WHO HAVE COVERAGE THE

CALIFORNIA ADULTS WHO HAVE

00:47:34.051 --> 00:47:37.821
COVERAGE. THROUGH THE

00:47:37.888 --> 00:47:38.922
INDIVIDUAL MARKETS. BUT TWO OF

00:47:38.989 --> 00:47:40.357
GROUPS I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT

00:47:40.424 --> 00:47:41.625
THAT PARTICULARLY FACE

00:47:41.692 --> 00:47:44.161
AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES DUE TO

00:47:44.228 --> 00:47:44.962
HIGH AND RISING HEALTH CARE

00:47:45.028 --> 00:47:46.730
COSTS ARE UNINSURED

00:47:46.797 --> 00:47:48.398
CALIFORNIANS AND THOSE ENROLLED

00:47:48.465 --> 00:47:52.035
IN MEDICARE. TURNING TO JOB

00:47:52.102 --> 00:47:54.371

00:47:54.438 --> 00:48:02.713
PLEASE. IF. IT TOGETHER

00:48:02.779 --> 00:48:04.147
CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS AND

00:48:04.214 --> 00:48:06.383
WORKERS SPENT A HUNDRED AND

00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:08.085
FORTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS ON

00:48:08.151 --> 00:48:10.921
COVERED HEALTHCARE BENEFITS IN

00:48:10.988 --> 00:48:11.388
TWENTY NINETEEN THAT'S

00:48:11.455 --> 00:48:14.258
EQUIVALENT TO APPROXIMATELY 5%

00:48:14.324 --> 00:48:16.193
OF OUR STATE'S ECONOMY. THIS

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:17.761
SPENDING INCLUDED FORTY FOUR

00:48:17.828 --> 00:48:20.597
BILLION THAT WORKERS PAID IN

00:48:20.664 --> 00:48:21.098
PREMIUMS AND OTHER COST

00:48:21.164 --> 00:48:23.000
SHARING- AND I'M GONNA TALK

00:48:23.066 --> 00:48:24.501
MORE IN A MINUTE ABOUT THE

00:48:24.568 --> 00:48:26.003
CONSEQUENCES OF THIS WORKERS

00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:27.938
SPENDING AND HOW IT RELATES TO

00:48:28.005 --> 00:48:30.107
THE SPENDING BY EMPLOYERS. BUT

00:48:30.173 --> 00:48:32.009
FIRST I WANT TO ADDRESS THE

00:48:32.075 --> 00:48:33.844
HUNDRED BILLION- THAT EMPLOYERS

00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:35.679
SPEND ON PREMIUMS EACH YEAR

00:48:35.746 --> 00:48:37.581
INCLUDING FIVE BILLION THAT THE

00:48:37.648 --> 00:48:40.350
STATE SPEND ON HEALTH BENEFITS

00:48:40.417 --> 00:48:42.386
FOR STATE EMPLOYEES WHO GET

00:48:42.452 --> 00:48:43.954
THEIR COVERAGE THROUGH CALPERS.

00:48:44.021 --> 00:48:45.355
CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS ARE

00:48:45.422 --> 00:48:46.823
SPENDING THIS HUNDRED BILLION

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:49.760
DOLLARS. EACH YEAR AND A MARKET

00:48:49.826 --> 00:48:51.328
THAT'S BROKEN IN A LOT OF WAYS

00:48:51.395 --> 00:48:52.562
WHICH WE'VE ALREADY STARTED TO

00:48:52.629 --> 00:48:53.997
HEAR ABOUT THIS HEARING IN

00:48:54.064 --> 00:48:55.432
WHICH- I THINK WE'LL BE HEARING

00:48:55.499 --> 00:48:57.434
MORE ABOUT. HEALTHCARE COSTS

00:48:57.501 --> 00:48:59.002
ARE GROWING RAPIDLY AND WITHOUT

00:48:59.069 --> 00:49:01.071
A CLEAR AND CORRESPONDING

00:49:01.138 --> 00:49:03.373
INCREASE IN THE VALUE RECEIVED.

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:04.708
HEALTH CARE PURCHASERS OFTEN

00:49:04.775 --> 00:49:06.076
LACK GOOD INFORMATION ABOUT

00:49:06.143 --> 00:49:07.911
WHAT THEY'RE BUYING. HEALTH

00:49:07.978 --> 00:49:08.979
CARE MARKETS IN THE STATE ARE

00:49:09.046 --> 00:49:10.781
HIGHLY CONSOLIDATED AND OFTEN

00:49:10.847 --> 00:49:12.883
LACK COMPETITION. NOT ONLY

00:49:12.949 --> 00:49:14.384
LEADING TO HIGHER PRICES BUT

00:49:14.451 --> 00:49:17.187
ALSO LARGE VARIATION IN PRICES

00:49:17.254 --> 00:49:18.855
THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE A

00:49:18.922 --> 00:49:22.859
CORRESPONDING. VARIATION IN IN

00:49:22.926 --> 00:49:24.761
QUALITY OR OUTCOMES. A LOT OF

00:49:24.828 --> 00:49:26.229
LARGE EMPLOYERS INCLUDING

00:49:26.296 --> 00:49:30.033
CALPERS. HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO

00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:31.835
TRY TO BEND THE COST CURVE WITH

00:49:31.902 --> 00:49:33.970
SOME SUCCESS BUT THEIR ABILITY

00:49:34.037 --> 00:49:36.139
TO CONTROL COSTS IS CONSTRAINED

00:49:36.206 --> 00:49:37.974
IN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM. EVEN THE

00:49:38.041 --> 00:49:39.643
LARGEST COMPANIES IN THE STATE

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:42.045
HAVE OFTEN HIT ROADBLOCKS AND

00:49:42.112 --> 00:49:45.315
ATTEMPTING TO TRY TO ENSURE THE

00:49:45.382 --> 00:49:45.916
HIGHEST VALUE FOR THEIR HEALTH

WHEN EMPLOYERS MAKE DECISIONS

00:50:32.763 --> 00:50:34.531
ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS RISING

00:50:34.598 --> 00:50:36.266
HEALTH CARE COSTS. THEY'RE

00:50:36.333 --> 00:50:37.567
GENERALLY THINKING ABOUT THEIR

00:50:37.634 --> 00:50:39.603

LAST DECADE AFTER ACCOUNTING

00:51:00.323 --> 00:51:02.259
FOR INFLATION WHILE WAGES FOR

00:51:02.325 --> 00:51:03.727
THE TYPICAL WORKER HAVE

00:51:03.794 --> 00:51:05.929
ESSENTIALLY REMAINED FLAT AFTER

00:51:05.996 --> 00:51:08.532
ACCOUNTING FOR INFLATION. IT'S

00:51:08.598 --> 00:51:10.734
DIFFICULT TO ISOLATE THE A FACT

00:51:10.801 --> 00:51:12.569
THAT RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS

00:51:12.636 --> 00:51:14.070
ALONE HAVE HAD ON LIEGE'S

00:51:14.137 --> 00:51:15.472
COMPARED TO THE OTHER FACTORS

00:51:15.539 --> 00:51:17.474
THAT AFFECT WAGES. SO THIS

00:51:17.541 --> 00:51:18.742
GRAPH IS NOT NECESSARILY SAY

00:51:18.809 --> 00:51:20.777
THAT WAGE STAGNATION IS SOLELY

00:51:20.844 --> 00:51:22.879
DUE TO RISING HEALTHCARE COSTS

00:51:22.946 --> 00:51:24.114
BUT THERE HAS BEEN RESEARCH

00:51:24.181 --> 00:51:25.949
SHOWING A CONNECTION BETWEEN

00:51:26.016 --> 00:51:27.484
RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS AND

00:51:27.551 --> 00:51:29.553
WAGE GROWTH. THAT IS SLOWER

00:51:29.619 --> 00:51:30.954
THAN THE WAGE GROWTH THAT WOULD

00:51:31.021 --> 00:51:33.657
HAVE OTHERWISE HAVE OCCURRED

00:51:33.723 --> 00:51:34.191
WITHOUT RISING HEALTH CARE

00:51:34.257 --> 00:51:38.295

INTEREST OF TIME. THANK YOU.

00:51:46.236 --> 00:51:47.304
ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS TYPE OF

00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:49.906
RESEARCH IS THE NATIONAL STUDY-

00:51:49.973 --> 00:51:51.842
THAT WAS CO AUTHORED BY ONE OF

00:51:51.908 --> 00:51:52.676
THE EXPERTS THAT WILL BE

00:51:52.742 --> 00:51:54.644
TESTIFYING LEADER IN THIS

00:51:54.711 --> 00:51:56.780
HEARING CHRISTOPHER WHALEY THIS

00:51:56.847 --> 00:51:59.015
NATIONAL RAM STUDY FOUND THAT

00:51:59.082 --> 00:52:02.953
HOSPITAL MERGERS OVER THE

00:52:03.019 --> 00:52:03.520
TWENTY TEN TO TWENTY SIXTEEN

00:52:03.587 --> 00:52:05.388
PERIOD LED TO A FIVE HUNDRED

00:52:05.455 --> 00:52:07.357
AND TWENTY ONE DOLLAR INCREASE

00:52:07.424 --> 00:52:09.259
IN HOSPITAL PRICES AND A

00:52:09.326 --> 00:52:11.261
SIMILARLY SIZED INCREASE IN

00:52:13.129 --> 00:52:15.298
WITH PRIVATE INSURANCE AND A

00:52:15.365 --> 00:52:18.268
SIMILARLY SIZED REDUCTION IN

00:52:18.335 --> 00:52:26.910
WAGES. NEXT SLIDE. IN ADDITION

00:52:26.977 --> 00:52:28.778
TO HAVING AN IMPACT ON WAGES

00:52:28.845 --> 00:52:31.448
ANOTHER. WAY THAT EMPLOYERS

00:52:31.515 --> 00:52:32.849
HAVE RESPONDED TO RISING

00:52:32.916 --> 00:52:34.718
HEALTHCARE COSTS IS BY

00:52:34.784 --> 00:52:35.986
INCREASING HOW MUCH WORKERS

00:52:36.052 --> 00:52:37.721
HAVE TO PAY OUT OF POCKET WHEN

00:52:37.787 --> 00:52:40.357
THEY ACCESS CARE THIS GRAPHIC

00:52:40.423 --> 00:52:42.526
SHOWS- THAT OVER THE LAST

00:52:42.592 --> 00:52:44.294
DECADE THE PERCENTAGE OF

00:52:44.361 --> 00:52:45.896
CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE A

00:52:45.962 --> 00:52:48.064
DEDUCTIBLE AS PART OF THEIR JOB

00:52:48.131 --> 00:52:50.901
BASED COVERAGE HAS INCREASED.

00:52:50.967 --> 00:52:54.504
48% WHICH IS STILL LOWER. THAN

00:52:54.571 --> 00:52:56.806
THE NATIONAL PERCENTAGE OF 82%

00:52:56.873 --> 00:52:58.742
WITH THE DEDUCTIBLE- BUT IT'S

00:52:58.808 --> 00:53:01.611
STILL GROWING. AND IMPORTANTLY

00:53:01.678 --> 00:53:03.780
THE AMOUNTS OF THE DEDUCTIBLE

00:53:03.847 --> 00:53:05.315
AMOUNT FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE A

00:53:05.382 --> 00:53:07.284
DEDUCTIBLE HAS NEARLY DOUBLED

00:53:07.350 --> 00:53:10.453
OVER THE LAST DECADE. TO

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:11.988
FOURTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS.

00:53:12.055 --> 00:53:14.057
SENATE ADOPTABLE IS JUST ONE

00:53:14.124 --> 00:53:15.959
MEASURE OF COST SHARING THAT'S

00:53:16.026 --> 00:53:17.527
RELATIVELY EASY TO TRACK OVER

00:53:17.594 --> 00:53:19.462
TIME- BUT PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE

00:53:19.529 --> 00:53:21.598
THE DEDUCTIBLES HAVE ALSO SEEN.

00:53:21.665 --> 00:53:23.166
AN INCREASE IN THEIR COST

00:53:23.233 --> 00:53:26.937
SHARING AS WELL. AN ABILITY TO

00:53:27.003 --> 00:53:28.672
AFFORD OUT OF POCKET COSTS AND

00:53:28.738 --> 00:53:30.574
HEALTH CARE IS NOT ONLY DRIVEN

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:32.342
BY HEALTH CARE PRICES IT'S ALSO

00:53:32.409 --> 00:53:34.277
TIED IN WITH THE LARGER

00:53:34.344 --> 00:53:36.413
PROBLEMS OF INCOME AND WEALTH

00:53:36.479 --> 00:53:39.115
INEQUALITY IN THIS COUNTRY- AS

00:53:39.182 --> 00:53:40.684
ONE EXAMPLE THE FEDERAL RESERVE

00:53:40.750 --> 00:53:43.119
ESTIMATED THAT 40% OF AMERICAN

00:53:43.186 --> 00:53:45.689
ADULTS. DON'T HAVE FOUR HUNDRED

00:53:45.755 --> 00:53:47.524
DOLLARS IN SAVINGS TO USE IN AN

00:53:47.591 --> 00:53:50.160
EMERGENCY AND THAT THAT REALLY.

00:53:50.226 --> 00:53:52.095
HELPS PUT THE FOURTEEN HUNDRED

00:53:52.162 --> 00:53:55.365
DOLLAR DEDUCTIBLE AND CONTEXT.

00:53:55.432 --> 00:54:01.905
NEXT SLIDE. SO GIVEN THAT THE

00:54:01.972 --> 00:54:05.609
ACA OF THAT RISK AGAIN I WANTED

00:54:05.675 --> 00:54:07.477
TO HIGHLIGHT BUT OVERTURNING

00:54:07.544 --> 00:54:09.312
THE ACA WOULD ONLY MAKE MATTERS

00:54:09.379 --> 00:54:10.580
WORSE FOR THOSE WITH JOB BASED

00:54:10.647 --> 00:54:12.983
COVERAGE BOTH IN TERMS OF

00:54:13.049 --> 00:54:15.051
ELIMINATING IMPORTANT

00:54:15.118 --> 00:54:16.219
PROTECTIONS ON OUT OF POCKET

00:54:16.286 --> 00:54:18.121
SPENDING THAT BENEFITED PEOPLE

00:54:18.188 --> 00:54:19.889
WITH JOB BASED COVERAGE AND

00:54:19.956 --> 00:54:21.391
ALSO IN TERMS OF THE COVERAGE

00:54:21.458 --> 00:54:23.627
EXPANSIONS UNDER THE ACA MANY

00:54:23.693 --> 00:54:25.195
CALIFORNIA YOUNG ADULTS ARE

00:54:25.261 --> 00:54:26.997
ABLE TO BE ON THEIR PARENTS JOB

00:54:27.063 --> 00:54:28.965
BASED COVERAGE AS A RESULT OF

00:54:29.032 --> 00:54:31.301
THEIR ACA. AS A RESULT OF THE

00:54:31.368 --> 00:54:34.971
ACA AND THE MAJOR ACA COVERAGE

00:54:35.038 --> 00:54:36.539
EXPANSIONS THE MEDICAID

00:54:36.606 --> 00:54:38.541
EXPANSION AND SUBSIDIZING

00:54:38.608 --> 00:54:39.209
CHURNED THROUGH COVERED

00:54:39.275 --> 00:54:41.945
CALIFORNIA ARE REALLY IMPORTANT

00:54:42.012 --> 00:54:44.681
PROTECTION FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE

00:54:44.748 --> 00:54:46.216
JOB BASED COVERAGE IN CASE THEY

00:54:46.282 --> 00:54:48.652
LOSE THAT COVERAGE OR LOSE

00:54:48.718 --> 00:54:52.656
THEIR JOB. COURTEOUS BY THE

00:54:52.722 --> 00:54:57.427
HEAD PLEASE. FIVE SEVENTEEN.

00:54:57.494 --> 00:54:59.095
TURNING TO THE INDIVIDUAL

00:54:59.162 --> 00:55:01.631
MARKETS- THERE ARE TWO

00:55:01.698 --> 00:55:02.932
DIFFERENT GROUPS IN THAT

00:55:02.999 --> 00:55:05.035
MARKET- THAT ARE AFFECTED BY

00:55:05.101 --> 00:55:07.037
COSTS GROWTH DIFFERENTLY. FOR

00:55:07.103 --> 00:55:08.738
THE MORE THAN ONE POINT THREE

00:55:08.805 --> 00:55:10.607
MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO GET

00:55:10.674 --> 00:55:11.808
THEIR INSURANCE THROUGH COVERED

00:55:11.875 --> 00:55:14.177
CALIFORNIA WITH A C. A. R.

00:55:14.244 --> 00:55:16.446
STATE SUBSIDIES. THOSE

00:55:16.513 --> 00:55:22.352
SUBSIDIES IMPROVE. AN AVERAGE

00:55:22.419 --> 00:55:24.421
PREMIUM OF FIVE HUNDRED AND

00:55:24.487 --> 00:55:26.489
EIGHTY TWO DOLLARS A MONTH DOWN

HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN

00:55:29.726 --> 00:55:32.629
DOLLARS AFTER SUBSIDIES.

00:55:32.696 --> 00:55:34.397
BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THE ACA

00:55:34.464 --> 00:55:36.466
AND THE STATE SUBSIDIES ARE

00:55:36.533 --> 00:55:38.368

FOR THE SILVER PLAN IN COVERED

00:56:39.796 --> 00:56:41.064

TO CALIFORNIA INFLATION. THE

00:57:04.053 --> 00:57:05.755
ACA DID SET STANDARDS FOR THE

WHEN THE DUST SETTLED ON TWENTY

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:45.074
TWENTY PEOPLE THEY WERE

01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:46.809
HEALTHCARE MARKETING CALIFORNIA

01:00:46.876 --> 01:00:49.812
WILL COMPLETELY REVERT BACK TO

01:00:49.879 --> 01:00:54.450
THE PEOPLE THAT STRUCTURE. SO

01:00:54.517 --> 01:00:57.086
THERE'S A COUPLE OF- PIECES FIT

01:00:57.153 --> 01:00:57.687
TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION FIRST

01:00:57.754 --> 01:01:00.857
OF ALL I THE- I THINK THAT THE

01:01:00.923 --> 01:01:02.158
CODE WOULD AFFECT ON

01:01:02.225 --> 01:01:05.762
UTILIZATION. IS GOING TO BE

01:01:05.828 --> 01:01:06.796
WITH US THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY

01:01:06.863 --> 01:01:08.498
ONE. SO I THINK WE'RE GOING TO

01:01:08.564 --> 01:01:09.732
SEE IT CONTINUE TO SEE

01:01:09.799 --> 01:01:12.101
DEPRESSED UTILIZATION. YEAH

01:01:12.168 --> 01:01:14.270
EVEN THOUGH I TOLD YOU I WE I

01:01:14.337 --> 01:01:15.471
LOOKED AT THESE TWENTY SEVEN

01:01:15.538 --> 01:01:18.641
FILINGS FOR- INSURANCE POLICIES

01:01:18.708 --> 01:01:21.677
FOR NEXT YEAR. ONLY TO THE

01:01:21.744 --> 01:01:22.612
TWENTY SEVEN BUILT IN ANY

01:01:22.678 --> 01:01:26.349
ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT KOVIC IT. BUT

01:01:26.416 --> 01:01:27.917
I BELIEVE THAT THAT WE'RE GONNA

01:01:27.984 --> 01:01:29.352
THAT UTILIZATION AND SPENDING

01:01:29.419 --> 01:01:33.723
WILL BE DOWN AGAIN. NEXT YEAR

01:01:33.790 --> 01:01:36.225
UNLESS WE HAVE SOME KIND OF

01:01:36.292 --> 01:01:37.360
HUGE SPIKE IN COVERT RELATED

01:01:37.427 --> 01:01:39.595
UTILIZATION AND EVEN THAT MOST

01:01:39.662 --> 01:01:40.496
OF THAT WOULD BE COVERED BY

01:01:40.563 --> 01:01:43.132
MEDICARE. SO I THINK SPENDING

01:01:43.199 --> 01:01:46.002
WILL BE DOWN- WE AVE SEEN THE

01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:48.871
L. POTENTIAL SILVER LINING SAID

01:01:48.938 --> 01:01:51.307
THE FED THAT THAT TELEHEALTH.

01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:54.110
WHICH HAD BEEN SLOW TO GROW

01:01:54.177 --> 01:01:55.578
XCELERATED AND THERE COULD BE

01:01:55.645 --> 01:01:58.114
POTENTIAL LONG TERM STRUCTURAL

01:01:58.181 --> 01:01:59.482
CHANGE THERE THAT COULD COULD

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:02.118
COULD DELIVER VALUE IF WE

01:02:02.185 --> 01:02:02.685
FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO THAT

01:02:02.752 --> 01:02:05.388
RIGHT- BUT THEN I ALSO WORRY

01:02:05.455 --> 01:02:08.291
ABOUT- BECAUSE MARKETS ARE NOT

01:02:08.357 --> 01:02:10.760
COMPETITIVE ARE WE GONNA SEE

01:02:10.827 --> 01:02:13.162
PRICE SPIKES. ON THE PROVIDER

01:02:13.229 --> 01:02:14.397
SIDE WHICH ARE THEN GOING TO

01:02:14.464 --> 01:02:16.699
FILTER INTO THE TWENTY TWENTY

PRICING THERE IS THE

01:02:59.275 --> 01:03:01.277
DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN WHAT YOU

CHALLENGES- THE- THERE WILL BE

01:04:32.735 --> 01:04:34.170
NO FINITE BREAKING POINT THE

01:04:34.237 --> 01:04:35.738
PROBLEM IS THE BREAKING POINT

01:04:35.805 --> 01:04:38.841
WILL HIT DIFFERENT FAMILIES. AT

SPENDING IS INCREASING WHICH IS

01:04:59.028 --> 01:05:00.463
REDUCING FAMILY BUDGET SO

01:05:00.529 --> 01:05:02.398
THERE'S ALL KINDS OF NEGATIVE

01:05:02.465 --> 01:05:05.935
CONSEQUENCES- THAT JUST ARE

SAID- BUT I DEFINITELY THINK

01:05:31.027 --> 01:05:32.128
THAT THIS COST GROWTH IS

01:05:32.194 --> 01:05:34.764
UNSUSTAINABLE- FOR FINANCIAL

01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:37.266
REASONS THAN FOR HEALTH REASONS

01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:41.437
M. FINANCIALLY M. HEALTHCARE

01:05:41.504 --> 01:05:42.772
COST GROWTH IS HAVING SUCH A

01:05:42.838 --> 01:05:45.408
BIG IMPACT ON WORKERS WAGES IT

01:05:45.474 --> 01:05:46.976
SAYS A STRUGGLE FOR EMPLOYERS

01:05:47.043 --> 01:05:48.144

AT IT WE NEED TO EARNED. IT

01:09:23.325 --> 01:09:25.027
MORE ACCOUNTABILITY WITHIN THE

TERMS OF THE OFFICE OF HEALTH

01:09:39.475 --> 01:09:40.876
CARE AFFORDABILITY I THINK

01:09:40.943 --> 01:09:42.678
WOULD MOVE US SENATE A GREAT

01:09:42.745 --> 01:09:45.981

AND THOSE ARE JUST A FEW OF

01:10:11.907 --> 01:10:15.477
THE- EXAMPLES. OF SOLUTIONS

01:10:15.544 --> 01:10:17.513

COMPETITIVE SYSTEM BUT I AGREE

01:10:31.293 --> 01:10:34.129

RIGHT NOW AND SO I'M NOT A BIG

01:10:37.533 --> 01:10:38.634
FAN OF REGULATION BUT

01:10:38.701 --> 01:10:41.403
REGULATION IS NEEDED TO RESTORE

01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:43.405
COMPETITION TO OUR MARKET. AND

01:10:43.472 --> 01:10:45.441
UP STILL HAVE HOPE THAT IF WE

01:10:45.507 --> 01:10:46.642
UNDERTAKE THE RIGHT PUBLIC

01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:48.577

PART OF THE SOLUTION HERE AND

01:10:53.549 --> 01:10:54.149
SO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:10:54.216 --> 01:10:56.552
HERE IS DATA AND TRANSPARENCY

01:10:56.619 --> 01:10:58.721

01:11:14.803 --> 01:11:15.671
REALLY SHOULD FOLLOW THE

01:11:15.738 --> 01:11:17.239
ATTORNEY GENERAL JUST SETTLED A

01:11:17.306 --> 01:11:18.674
BIG ANTI TRUST CASE IN THE

HOSPITAL MARKET IN CALIFORNIA

01:11:20.476 --> 01:11:21.543
WE SHOULD LOOK AT THAT

01:11:21.610 --> 01:11:23.345
SETTLEMENT BECAUSE THAT CASE

01:11:23.412 --> 01:11:25.514
PRODUCED EVIDENCE THAT SHOWS.

01:11:25.581 --> 01:11:27.449

SETTLEMENT INCLUDES TERMS THAT

01:11:31.754 --> 01:11:34.356

01:13:04.913 --> 01:13:06.582
AN ESTIMATE FROM THE INSURANCE

01:13:06.648 --> 01:13:09.485
COMPANY THAT YOU KNOW. IS SO

01:13:09.551 --> 01:13:11.153
HIGH THAT YOU'RE SCARED TO

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:12.421
DEATH THINKING HOW CAN I HAVE A

01:13:12.488 --> 01:13:14.356
PAY THAT THEN ALL THE SUDDEN

01:13:14.423 --> 01:13:15.891
ANOTHER MONTH OR TWO GOES BY

01:13:15.958 --> 01:13:17.993
HERE IS THE NOTHING. AND THEN

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:19.628
YOU GET A BILL AND IT. HARDLY

01:13:19.695 --> 01:13:21.830
ANYTHING OR IT COULD BE QUITE A

01:13:21.897 --> 01:13:23.832
LOT SO I CAN DEFINITELY SEE HOW

01:13:23.899 --> 01:13:26.635
PEOPLE CAN BE WORRIED ABOUT

01:13:26.702 --> 01:13:28.504
THOSE OUT OF POCKET COSTS

01:13:28.570 --> 01:13:29.638
SPECIALLY WHEN THEY DON'T KNOW

01:13:29.705 --> 01:13:32.007
WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE- WHEN

01:13:32.074 --> 01:13:33.542
YOU GO IN AND BE NICE IF YOU

01:13:33.609 --> 01:13:35.043
KIND OF KNEW WHAT YOU'RE PAYING

01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:38.814
FOR WHEN YOU GO AND WHAT THAT

01:13:38.881 --> 01:13:40.115
WOULD COST. BUT IT'S SUCH A

01:13:40.182 --> 01:13:42.584
CALM. THIS YOU KNOW IF ENGLISH

01:13:42.651 --> 01:13:44.987
OF THE FACT LET. CO YOU KNOW

01:13:45.053 --> 01:13:46.822
HOW CAN YOU EVER TRY TO

01:13:46.889 --> 01:13:50.058
NAVIGATE THE NIGHT I KNOW.

01:13:50.125 --> 01:13:52.795
ANOTHER ISSUE IS YOU KNOW YOU

01:13:52.861 --> 01:13:55.264
LOOK AT DENTAL INSURANCE. AND I

01:13:55.330 --> 01:13:58.000
KNOW I DO IT MYSELF IF- IT RUNS

01:13:58.066 --> 01:13:59.334
OUT BUT THAT THAT DOESN'T PAY

01:13:59.401 --> 01:14:01.236
FOR ALL THAT MUCH ANYWAY YOU

01:14:01.303 --> 01:14:03.272
JUST CARRIED OVER AND CONTINUE

01:14:03.338 --> 01:14:04.740
THE TREATMENT NEXT YEAR AND THE

01:14:04.807 --> 01:14:06.642
NEXT CALENDAR YEAR RATHER THAN

01:14:06.708 --> 01:14:08.343
FINISHED IT YOU KNOW WHEN IT

01:14:08.410 --> 01:14:12.147
NEEDS TO BE SO. I MEAN THAT

01:14:12.214 --> 01:14:13.715
THOSE ARE ISSUES THAT I SAW

01:14:13.782 --> 01:14:15.818
WHEN I WAS I WAS GOING THROUGH

01:14:15.884 --> 01:14:18.520
THE SLIDE AHEAD OF TIME. THAT

01:14:18.587 --> 01:14:20.889
CAME TO LIGHT TO ME AS THE WAY

01:14:20.956 --> 01:14:25.394
PEOPLE IN GENERAL BEHAVE- DUE

01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:26.728
TO WHAT THEY'RE PRESENTED WITH

01:14:26.795 --> 01:14:29.431
IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND- I

01:14:29.498 --> 01:14:31.166
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SOLUTION S

01:14:31.233 --> 01:14:33.302
TO THAT. AND THE MORNING IF

01:14:33.368 --> 01:14:34.436

GETTING AND I WILL DO A BETTER

01:15:18.146 --> 01:15:20.048

GET A DIRECT ANSWER THAT WAY SO

01:15:56.218 --> 01:15:58.020
ANYWAY BUT IT DANCE AROUND THAT

01:15:58.086 --> 01:16:00.322
ONE A LITTLE BIT SO- THANK YOU

01:16:00.389 --> 01:16:02.324
I WANT TO AND FIRST BUT THAT

WAS A THANK YOU TO BOTH BOTH

01:16:03.725 --> 01:16:04.493
PANELISTS I THINK THIS IS

01:16:04.559 --> 01:16:05.661
REALLY INFORMATION GOOD

01:16:05.727 --> 01:16:06.795
INFORMATION TO HELP TO SET THE

01:16:06.862 --> 01:16:08.096
STAGE FOR THINGS AND I WANT TO

01:16:08.163 --> 01:16:09.731
GO TO DOCTOR MELNICK. AS OF A

01:16:09.798 --> 01:16:10.766
COUPLE KIND OF SPECIFIC

01:16:10.832 --> 01:16:12.000
QUESTIONS AND THEN IT WILL MOVE

01:16:12.067 --> 01:16:16.305
ON IN THE INTEREST OF TIME SO.

01:16:16.371 --> 01:16:18.707
TO QUESTIONS HERE FIRST OF ALL.

01:16:18.774 --> 01:16:21.977
YOUR SLIDE ON. PAGE NINE IT'S

01:16:22.044 --> 01:16:23.679
SAYS IT SAYS CALIFORNIA DATA

01:16:23.745 --> 01:16:25.814
SHOW SIMILAR TRENDS. PRICES

01:16:25.881 --> 01:16:27.549
INCREASING OR DRIVING INCREASED

01:16:27.616 --> 01:16:29.217
HOSPITAL SPENDING SO WHAT YOU

01:16:29.284 --> 01:16:31.787
SAID WITH YOUR SLIDE SAYS. THAT

01:16:31.853 --> 01:16:33.088
BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT

01:16:33.155 --> 01:16:34.923
AND TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN

01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:38.160
WE HAD A FIFTEEN PERCENT. DROP

01:16:38.226 --> 01:16:41.663
IN. VOLUME AND A TWO HUNDRED

01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:45.701
AND 83% INCREASE IN SPENDING

01:16:45.767 --> 01:16:48.303
SO. YOU KNOW YOU'RE THE

01:16:48.370 --> 01:16:50.806
ECONOMIST HERE. IS THAT THOSE

01:16:50.872 --> 01:16:53.875
INCREASES TRYING TO MAKE UP FOR

01:16:53.942 --> 01:16:55.043
THE FOR THE LOST REVENUE IN IN

01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:57.579
THE VOLUME AND FOR WHAT IS

01:16:57.646 --> 01:16:58.580
THERE ANOTHER DELTA THERE AS

01:16:58.647 --> 01:17:00.248
WELL BECAUSE IF YOU'RE VOLUMES

01:17:00.315 --> 01:17:03.218
GOING DOWN. YEAH AND YOU'RE NOT

01:17:03.285 --> 01:17:04.219
AND YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO

01:17:04.286 --> 01:17:06.154
INCREASE EFFICIENCIES THE ONLY

01:17:06.221 --> 01:17:07.522
WAY YOU'RE GOING TO RESTORE

01:17:07.589 --> 01:17:08.557
THAT REVENUE IS TO INCREASE

01:17:08.623 --> 01:17:12.494
PRICES SO. SO DOES THOSE

01:17:12.561 --> 01:17:13.729
INCREASE PRICES LEAD TO. INDEED

01:17:13.795 --> 01:17:16.465
ADDITIONAL PROFITS OR ARE THEY

01:17:16.531 --> 01:17:17.966
TRYING TO MAKE UP FOR THE

01:17:18.033 --> 01:17:23.005
DECREASE IN VOLUME. WELL IT'S A

01:17:23.071 --> 01:17:24.406
CUT IT'S A GOOD QUESTION IS A

01:17:24.473 --> 01:17:26.775
COMBINATION OF FACTORS SO- YOU

01:17:26.842 --> 01:17:29.244
KNOW IT PART OF THAT INCREASE

01:17:29.311 --> 01:17:31.346
2210083% INCREASES THERE'S THE

01:17:31.413 --> 01:17:33.415
GENERAL INFLATION. BUT

01:17:33.482 --> 01:17:35.217
INFLATION WAS RELATIVELY LOW

01:17:35.283 --> 01:17:36.218
DURING THAT TIME PERIOD I CAN'T

01:17:36.284 --> 01:17:39.087
REMEMBER THE NUMBERS BUT MAYBE-

01:17:39.154 --> 01:17:41.957
YOU YOU'RE A BABY 30% OF THAT

01:17:42.024 --> 01:17:43.625
TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY PERCENT. IS

01:17:43.692 --> 01:17:47.462
UNDERLYING CPI YEAH THEN ONE OF

01:17:47.529 --> 01:17:49.831
THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED IS-

01:17:49.898 --> 01:17:52.034
HOSPITALS HAVE ALSO BECOME

01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:56.271
QUIETLY OVER TIME GIANT

01:17:56.338 --> 01:17:57.439
EMERGENCY CENTERS. SO IN

01:17:57.506 --> 01:18:00.008
CALIFORNIA TWO THIRDS OF THE

01:18:00.075 --> 01:18:02.444
PATIENTS ADMITTED TO A HOSPITAL

01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:04.679
COME THROUGH THE EMERGENCY ROOM.

01:18:04.746 --> 01:18:07.349
AND SO THEY TEND TO BE SICKER.

01:18:07.416 --> 01:18:09.151
AND MORE OF THE LESS SEVERELY

01:18:09.217 --> 01:18:11.353
ILL PATIENTS ARE BEING TREATED

01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:13.522
NOW AS OUTPATIENTS SO PART OF

01:18:13.588 --> 01:18:15.557
THAT INCREASE IS CHANGING

01:18:15.624 --> 01:18:18.527
PATIENT MIX SEVERITY OF ILLNESS

01:18:18.593 --> 01:18:20.162
CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND

01:18:20.228 --> 01:18:23.432
THINGS LIKE THAT. SO THAT

01:18:23.498 --> 01:18:24.933
210083% IS NOT A FEWER PRICE

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.469
INCREASE BUT A BIG CHUNK OF IT

01:18:27.536 --> 01:18:29.304
IS AND ONE ONE COMMERCE TALK

01:18:29.371 --> 01:18:30.672
ABOUT A FEW OUR PRICE INCREASE

01:18:30.739 --> 01:18:32.574
WHAT THEY MEAN IS. IT'S NOT

01:18:32.641 --> 01:18:34.376
DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN THE

01:18:34.443 --> 01:18:37.746
PRODUCT BUT RATHER IN THIS CASE

01:18:37.813 --> 01:18:40.015
WERE TRIPPING IT TO. MARKET

01:18:40.082 --> 01:18:40.916
POWER THE ABILITY TO RAISE

01:18:40.982 --> 01:18:43.485
PRICES NOT BECAUSE THE PRODUCT

01:18:43.552 --> 01:18:45.454
IS BETTER OR SERVICES BETTER

01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:48.190
WHATEVER SIMPLY BECAUSE WE CAN

01:18:48.256 --> 01:18:48.957
WE HAVE THE POWER TO RAISE

01:18:49.024 --> 01:18:51.660
PRICES- TO USE THAT MONEY TO DO

01:18:51.726 --> 01:18:53.361
OTHER THINGS. IN SOME CASES

01:18:53.428 --> 01:18:55.197
HOSPITAL PROFITS YOU KNOW

01:18:55.263 --> 01:18:56.865
INCREASED DRAMATICALLY. YOU

01:18:56.932 --> 01:18:58.633
KNOW FOR THE CENTER CASE THERE

01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:00.202
WERE THERE'S DATA IN THE RECORD

01:19:00.268 --> 01:19:02.404
THAT SHOWED. UP FOR TEN YEAR

01:19:02.471 --> 01:19:06.108
PERIOD- SUTTER WAS AVERAGING

01:19:06.174 --> 01:19:07.509
FORTY PLUS PERCENT PROFIT

01:19:07.576 --> 01:19:10.512
MARGIN ON COMMERCIAL PATIENTS

01:19:10.579 --> 01:19:11.847
EVERY YEAR FOR TEN YEARS.

01:19:11.913 --> 01:19:13.582
BECAUSE OF THEIR MARKET POWER

01:19:13.648 --> 01:19:15.217
SO IN THAT CASE THEY WERE

01:19:15.283 --> 01:19:17.085
GENERATING PROFITS FROM THOSE

01:19:17.152 --> 01:19:19.754
INCREASE PRICES. OF STOP THEIR

01:19:19.821 --> 01:19:21.590
IN A KIND OF A FOLLOW UP TO

01:19:21.656 --> 01:19:23.225
THAT SO IT WHAT ARE YOUR SLIDES

01:19:23.291 --> 01:19:25.360
AND I'M JUST LOOKING FOR A KIND

01:19:25.427 --> 01:19:26.995
OF A GENERAL ANSWER HERE AS HE

01:19:27.062 --> 01:19:28.763
TALKED ABOUT OUT OF NETWORK.

01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:31.333
CAUGHT UP COSTS IN EMERGENCY

01:19:31.399 --> 01:19:33.335
ROOMS WHAT POINT DID YOU START

01:19:33.401 --> 01:19:35.003
WE START TO SEE THAT BEGIN TO

01:19:35.070 --> 01:19:38.907
SPIKE. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE DID

01:19:38.974 --> 01:19:39.441
WE HAVE WE HAVE A SURPRISE

01:19:39.508 --> 01:19:41.042
BILLING. WE HAVE SURPRISE

01:19:41.109 --> 01:19:44.412
BILLING BILL IN CALIFORNIA AB

01:19:44.479 --> 01:19:45.013
SEVENTY TWO WAS PASSED IN TWO

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:47.516
THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN. AND IT

01:19:47.582 --> 01:19:49.718
DOESN'T COVER EMERGENCY ROOMS

01:19:49.784 --> 01:19:50.752
AND ENOUGH YOU'RE IN AN

01:19:50.819 --> 01:19:52.154
EMERGENCY SOMETIMES IF YOU'RE

01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:53.355
BROUGHT TO A HOSPITAL YOU DON'T

01:19:53.421 --> 01:19:54.256
HAVE A CHOICE WHERE YOU'RE

01:19:54.322 --> 01:19:56.091
GOING. SO YOU MAY BE OUT OF

01:19:56.158 --> 01:19:58.126
NETWORK. AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE

01:19:58.193 --> 01:19:59.561
TRIED AND THE LET'S INTEREST

01:19:59.628 --> 01:20:00.896
TRIED TO MOVE. YOU KNOW THE

01:20:00.962 --> 01:20:02.731
SURPRISE BILLING INTO THE E. R.

01:20:02.797 --> 01:20:04.833
AND HAS NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN

01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:07.269
THAT SO I'M CURIOUS. WHERE WHAT

01:20:07.335 --> 01:20:09.404
TIME FRAME DID WE START TO SEE

01:20:09.471 --> 01:20:11.673
THAT SPIKE. AND BECAUSE IT IT

01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:14.075
FEELS LIKE IT'S IT HAS IT IS A

01:20:14.142 --> 01:20:15.977
SPIKE AND IT'S HAPPENED FAIRLY

01:20:16.044 --> 01:20:22.684
RECENTLY. IT EVOLVED OVER TIME

01:20:22.751 --> 01:20:24.920
AND SO WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE

01:20:24.986 --> 01:20:25.954
OF THE LEGISLATION IN

01:20:26.021 --> 01:20:27.856
CALIFORNIA WHICH WAS A GOOD LAW

01:20:27.923 --> 01:20:29.257
BASICALLY SAID YOU KNOW FOR

01:20:29.324 --> 01:20:31.059
PUBLIC HEALTH PURPOSES IF YOU

01:20:31.126 --> 01:20:32.594
HAVE AN EMERGENCY USUALLY GO TO

01:20:32.661 --> 01:20:34.196
THE NEAREST EMERGENCY ROOM AND

01:20:34.262 --> 01:20:37.098
YOUR PLAN HAVE TO PAY. BUT THE

01:20:37.165 --> 01:20:38.033
HOSPITAL'S FIGURED OUT A WE

01:20:38.099 --> 01:20:39.801
RAISE OUR BILL CHARGE WE DON'T

01:20:39.868 --> 01:20:41.469
HAVE A CONTRACT WE'RE GOING TO

01:20:41.536 --> 01:20:43.805
NOW SUBMIT THAT AS THE PRICE.

01:20:43.872 --> 01:20:45.607
AND SO THAT HAS CONTINUALLY

01:20:45.674 --> 01:20:46.641
GROWN AND GROWN AND GROWN OVER

01:20:46.708 --> 01:20:49.077
TIME AT THE SAME TIME AS I

01:20:49.144 --> 01:20:50.879
MENTIONED. HOSPITALS HAVE

01:20:50.946 --> 01:20:52.747
BECOME GIANT EMERGENCY CENTERS

01:20:52.814 --> 01:20:54.916
AND SO MORE OF THEIR VOLUME

01:20:54.983 --> 01:20:57.586
COMES THROUGH THE E. D. SO- WE

01:20:57.652 --> 01:20:58.553
DID A STUDY THAT SHOWED

01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:00.889
HOSPITALS WHEN THEY- EVEN IF

01:21:00.956 --> 01:21:02.691
THEY CANCEL THEIR CONTRACTS.

01:21:02.757 --> 01:21:04.626
THEY KEEP HALF OF THE EMERGENCY

01:21:04.693 --> 01:21:06.461
VALUE EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT

01:21:06.528 --> 01:21:08.430
IN THE NETWORK. AND THEN THEY

01:21:08.496 --> 01:21:09.965
COULD CHARGE FULL BILLS BILL

01:21:10.031 --> 01:21:11.666
CHARGES AND SO THAT PUTS

01:21:11.733 --> 01:21:13.068
TREMENDOUS PRESSURE ON THE

01:21:13.134 --> 01:21:14.970
PLANTS TO SAY OKAY WE CAN'T

01:21:15.036 --> 01:21:16.571
AFFORD TO LET THIS HOSPITAL OUT

01:21:16.638 --> 01:21:17.772
OF THE NETWORK BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:21:17.839 --> 01:21:19.241
GONNA COME BACK INSTEAD OF IT

01:21:19.307 --> 01:21:20.141
BEING A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR

01:21:20.208 --> 01:21:21.610
BILL. FREDDIE OUR VISIT COULD

01:21:21.676 --> 01:21:23.745
BE FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND

01:21:23.812 --> 01:21:25.380
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY. SO

01:21:25.447 --> 01:21:27.616
THAT IS IF YOU WANTED TO CUT

01:21:27.682 --> 01:21:29.751
COSTS. YOU LIMITED AND WE DIDA

01:21:29.818 --> 01:21:32.554
STUDY OF THIS A HUNDRED AND 60%

01:21:32.621 --> 01:21:34.422
OF THE COST OF A- FOR EACH

01:21:34.489 --> 01:21:36.324
POSSIBLE YOU LIMIT THEIR ER

01:21:36.391 --> 01:21:39.828
PRICE. FOR OUT OF NETWORK

01:21:39.894 --> 01:21:40.895
210060% OF THEIR CALL. WE WOULD

01:21:40.962 --> 01:21:42.998
SAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN

01:21:43.064 --> 01:21:47.168
CALIFORNIA OVERNIGHT. JUST FROM

01:21:47.235 --> 01:21:48.503
THAT CHANGE. THANK YOU MISTER

01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:49.938
MAYES HAD ANOTHER. AND WE MIGHT

01:21:50.005 --> 01:21:51.006
GETTING TO THIS A LITTLE BIT

01:21:51.072 --> 01:21:52.340
LATER BUT DOCUMENTED BECAUSE

01:21:52.407 --> 01:21:54.042
YOU BROUGHT UP THE HOSPITAL'S

01:21:54.109 --> 01:21:55.910
BECOME EMERGENCY CENTERS OUR

01:21:55.977 --> 01:21:57.479
MINDS ME OF- TOUR THAT I HAD

01:21:57.545 --> 01:21:58.913
DONE ONE OF MY SMALLER

01:21:58.980 --> 01:22:00.515
HOSPITALS IN MY DISTRICT. THE

01:22:00.582 --> 01:22:02.751
AND THE NUMBER OF- OF THE

01:22:02.817 --> 01:22:05.020
BEHAVIOR HEALTH. THAT PATIENTS-

01:22:05.086 --> 01:22:06.288
THAT THEY HAD MENTAL HEALTH OF

01:22:06.354 --> 01:22:08.390
PATIENTS- THAT THEY HAD. IN THE

01:22:08.456 --> 01:22:11.259
EMERGENCY ROOM AND HOW LONG

01:22:11.326 --> 01:22:13.261
THAT THEY WERE HAVING TO STAY.

01:22:13.328 --> 01:22:16.898
THERE CAN YOU ADDRESS- THAT A

01:22:16.965 --> 01:22:17.499
BIT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:22:17.565 --> 01:22:23.672
COSTS. IT HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED

01:22:23.738 --> 01:22:25.674
ENOUGH BUT THERE'S A CHANGING

01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:29.244
MIX. OF EDIE OF EIGHTY PATIENTS

01:22:29.311 --> 01:22:31.313
OVER TIME AND MENTAL HEALTH

01:22:31.379 --> 01:22:32.480
VISITS AND MENTAL HEALTH

01:22:32.547 --> 01:22:34.182
ADMISSIONS. HAVE BEEN TAKING AN

01:22:34.249 --> 01:22:36.985
INCREASING SHARE. OF THAT AND

01:22:37.052 --> 01:22:39.287
WE REALLY. REALLY HAVEN'T

01:22:39.354 --> 01:22:41.656
APPRECIATED THAT STUDY THAT AND

01:22:41.723 --> 01:22:43.458
FIGURED OUT HOW TO HANDLE THAT.

01:22:43.525 --> 01:22:45.760
CHANGE IN UTILIZATION

01:22:45.827 --> 01:22:49.664
EFFICIENTLY. MR THANK YOU THANK

01:22:49.731 --> 01:22:52.133
YOU DR RON- I HAVE A QUESTION A

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:53.635
AND WANT TO GO BACK TWENTY SAID

01:22:53.702 --> 01:22:55.503
PUSH YOUR BUTTON THERE I IT'S

01:22:55.570 --> 01:22:57.138
PUSHED OUT OKAY I'M SORRY I

01:22:57.205 --> 01:22:58.640
HAVE MY MASK IN MY LITTLE BOYS

01:22:58.707 --> 01:23:02.177
DON'T TRAVEL WELL- SO. HAS

01:23:02.243 --> 01:23:03.211
THERE BEEN A STUDY ON HOW WHAT

01:23:03.278 --> 01:23:04.612
PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:23:04.679 --> 01:23:06.514
UTILIZING THE EMERGENCY ROOM I

01:23:06.581 --> 01:23:08.383
KNOW IN MY DISTRICT WHICH IS.

01:23:08.450 --> 01:23:10.785
MORE CHALLENGE COMMUNITY- WE

01:23:10.852 --> 01:23:12.921
TEND. OUR FOLKS TEND TO USE THE

01:23:12.987 --> 01:23:14.022
EMERGENCY ROOM BECAUSE THEY

01:23:14.089 --> 01:23:15.290
DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE

01:23:15.357 --> 01:23:17.592
REGULAR DOCTOR. AND SO I GUESS

01:23:17.659 --> 01:23:19.127
MY QUESTION WOULD BE AND THEY

01:23:19.194 --> 01:23:20.895
WILL WAIT FOR HOURS BECAUSE-

01:23:20.962 --> 01:23:22.063
THAT'S BETTER THAN WAITING FOR

01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:24.132
DAYS. NOW THAT THERE ARE TRULY

01:23:24.199 --> 01:23:26.468
SICK. WHAT PERCENTAGE AND

01:23:26.534 --> 01:23:27.635
THAT'S MY DISTRICT BUT WHAT

01:23:27.702 --> 01:23:29.337
PERCENTAGE YOU THINK OF HAS

01:23:29.404 --> 01:23:30.472
THERE BEEN STUDIES ON HOW MANY

01:23:30.538 --> 01:23:31.606
PEOPLE WHAT PERCENT OF PEOPLE

01:23:31.673 --> 01:23:32.941
ARE DOING USING THE EMERGENCY

01:23:33.007 --> 01:23:35.543
ROOM BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE

01:23:35.610 --> 01:23:37.245
ACCESS TO PROPER HEALTH CARE.

01:23:37.312 --> 01:23:38.880
THAT BE MY FIRST QUESTION AND

01:23:38.947 --> 01:23:40.682
THEN MY SECOND QUESTION IS NOT

01:23:40.749 --> 01:23:42.250
YOU'VE IDENTIFIED YOUR AN

01:23:42.317 --> 01:23:44.719
IMPORTANT. DEFICIENCY IN OUR

01:23:44.786 --> 01:23:47.856
SYSTEM SO BASICALLY THERE ARE

01:23:47.922 --> 01:23:50.058
LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF VISITS

01:23:50.125 --> 01:23:52.227
IN THE E. D. WHERE PATIENTS ARE

01:23:52.293 --> 01:23:54.229
SUBSTITUTING THE E. D. WHICH IS

01:23:54.295 --> 01:23:55.930
A HIGHER LEVEL MORE EXPENSIVE

01:23:55.997 --> 01:23:57.932
LEVEL OF CARE. FOR WHAT COULD

01:23:57.999 --> 01:24:00.268
BE HANDLED. WITH A DOCTOR VISIT

01:24:00.335 --> 01:24:03.438
NOW THE GOOD NEWS IS IF WE

01:24:03.505 --> 01:24:04.773
LEVERAGE WHAT HAPPENED WITH

01:24:04.839 --> 01:24:08.443
TELEHEALTH DURING THE PANDEMIC.

01:24:08.510 --> 01:24:10.245
WE CAN ACTUALLY IMPROVE ACCESS-

01:24:10.311 --> 01:24:13.748
UP AND MAKE IT MORE ACCESSIBLE

01:24:13.815 --> 01:24:14.849
TO COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY

01:24:14.916 --> 01:24:17.051
RURAL AREAS BUT ALSO OTHER

01:24:17.118 --> 01:24:18.052
COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE'S A

01:24:18.119 --> 01:24:20.054
SHORTAGE OF LOCAL DOCTORS TO

01:24:20.121 --> 01:24:21.723
TREAT THOSE PATIENTS SO THERE

01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:24.626
IS A POTENTIAL SILVER LINING-

01:24:24.692 --> 01:24:25.527
IF WE FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT

01:24:25.593 --> 01:24:28.663
CORRECTLY. AND THEN MY FOLLOW

01:24:28.730 --> 01:24:30.098
UP QUESTION WOULD BE IS THAT.

01:24:30.165 --> 01:24:31.733
IS THERE A BALANCING ACT

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:33.835
BETWEEN IF ARE THERE STATES

01:24:33.902 --> 01:24:36.204
THAT HAVE ACTUALLY PUT THIS

01:24:36.271 --> 01:24:37.806
KIND OF LIMIT ON EMERGENCY ROOM

01:24:37.872 --> 01:24:39.974
COSTS- DO THEY BALANCE THAT OUT

01:24:40.041 --> 01:24:41.509
WITH REIMBURSEMENT SO THAT

01:24:41.576 --> 01:24:42.777
LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES

01:24:42.844 --> 01:24:46.281
ACTUALLY. HAVE A LITTLE BIT

01:24:46.347 --> 01:24:46.881
MORE ACCESS I MEAN IS THERE A

01:24:46.948 --> 01:24:48.716
BALANCING ACT THAT HAS TO BE

01:24:48.783 --> 01:24:50.852
DONE IF YOU WOULD DO ONE IS

01:24:50.919 --> 01:24:53.488
THERE ANY SORT OF SCALE THAT IS

01:24:53.555 --> 01:24:53.988
IN BALLOTS IF YOU DO ONE

01:24:54.055 --> 01:24:59.360
WITHOUT THE OTHER. WELL IF I

01:24:59.427 --> 01:25:00.829
UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION SO THE

01:25:00.895 --> 01:25:02.330
ONLY STATE THAT THAT HAS

01:25:02.397 --> 01:25:04.732
LIMITED. EMERGENCY OUT OF

01:25:04.799 --> 01:25:06.334
NETWORK HOSPITAL THERE ARE

01:25:06.401 --> 01:25:08.069
STATES THAT HAVE DONE POSITION

01:25:08.136 --> 01:25:10.038
BUT NOT THE HOSPITAL FEES THE

01:25:10.104 --> 01:25:12.173
ONLY STATE AS MARYLAND. AND IF

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:13.174
YOU LOOK AT THE DATA IT'S

01:25:13.241 --> 01:25:15.143
AMAZING THEIR BILL CHARGES HAVE

01:25:15.210 --> 01:25:17.779
HARDLY GROWN. BECAUSE THERE'S

01:25:17.846 --> 01:25:18.980
NO REASON THE RAISE YOUR

01:25:19.047 --> 01:25:20.849
CHARGES BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET

01:25:20.915 --> 01:25:24.052
THEM. HEY SO THE L. WHICH SHOWS

01:25:24.118 --> 01:25:26.688
THAT LIMITING THE NET PRICE

01:25:26.754 --> 01:25:27.655
THAT YOU WOULD GET FROM HIGH

01:25:27.722 --> 01:25:29.357
BILL CHARGES COULD BE AN

01:25:29.424 --> 01:25:31.426
EFFECTIVE MECHANISM. AS I

01:25:31.493 --> 01:25:33.962
MENTIONED WE STUDIED- WE DID A

01:25:34.028 --> 01:25:35.864
SIMULATION THAT SAID WE COULD

01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:37.866
PAY EVERY HOSPITAL CALIFORNIA

01:25:37.932 --> 01:25:39.167
IF THEY TREAT AN EMERGENCY

01:25:39.234 --> 01:25:41.336
PATIENT OUT OF NETWORK. WE

01:25:41.402 --> 01:25:44.572
COULD PAY THEM A HUNDRED AND

01:25:44.639 --> 01:25:46.508
60% OF THEIR COSTS. GUARANTEE

01:25:46.574 --> 01:25:48.243
THEM A 60% OFF OF MARGIN AND

01:25:48.309 --> 01:25:51.813
STILL. REDUCE THE LEVERAGE THAT

01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:53.314
LEADS TO THESE HIGH PRICES

01:25:53.381 --> 01:25:57.218
SYSTEM WHY SO WE YEAH WE HAVE

01:25:57.285 --> 01:25:59.821
THE POWER TO DO THAT IF WE KNOW

01:25:59.888 --> 01:26:02.257
IF WE HAVE SUPPORT TO DO IT.

01:26:02.323 --> 01:26:04.259
THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

01:26:04.325 --> 01:26:05.159
AND WE WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE

01:26:05.226 --> 01:26:08.296
ON TO OUR SECOND PANEL NOW AND-

01:26:08.363 --> 01:26:09.998
WILL CALL FORTH A WE CAN WE CAN

01:26:10.064 --> 01:26:11.399
FIND I'M NOT SURE WHERE DR

TALKING TO US ABOUT. HEALTHCARE

01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:27.549
COSTS DRIVERS SO- AND THE MORE

REALLY MUTE US AND- YOU KNOW

01:26:33.521 --> 01:26:35.123
MUTING CAN BE A NICE THING IF

01:26:35.189 --> 01:26:36.524
YOU GOT TO THROW VOIGTS BUT-

01:26:36.591 --> 01:26:37.926
SOMETIMES IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO

BEST TO SPEAK BOLDLY. I CAN

THINK OF ANOTHER WORD TO. THINK

01:26:53.775 --> 01:26:57.645
OF ANOTHER WORD. SO THERE'S A

01:26:57.712 --> 01:26:59.480
LITTLE ECHO HERE FOR ME NOW.

01:26:59.547 --> 01:27:01.015
AND THAT MUCH MUCH MUCH BETTER

01:27:01.082 --> 01:27:02.116
OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

01:27:02.183 --> 01:27:04.452
HAVING ME I'M HERE TODAY TO

01:27:04.519 --> 01:27:07.021
TESTIFY ON THE TOPIC OF A

01:27:07.088 --> 01:27:11.326
HEALTHCARE COSTS DRIVERS. AN

01:27:11.392 --> 01:27:11.893
LET'S GO TO THE FIRST SLIDE

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:16.331
PLEASE X. OKAY SO YOU FOLKS I

01:27:16.397 --> 01:27:18.499
I'VE BEEN ABLE TO HEAR SOME OF

01:27:18.566 --> 01:27:19.767
THE QUESTIONS ALTHOUGH NOT ALL

01:27:19.834 --> 01:27:21.135
OF THE QUESTIONS AND VERY FEW

01:27:21.202 --> 01:27:23.471
THE RESPONSES RIGHT SO I'LL TRY

01:27:23.538 --> 01:27:24.772
TO ADJUST. MY PRESENTATION

01:27:24.839 --> 01:27:27.008
ACCORDINGLY I'M GOING TO FOCUS

01:27:27.075 --> 01:27:28.977
MOSTLY ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL

01:27:29.043 --> 01:27:30.645
AND THINK ABOUT RESEARCH ON THE

01:27:30.712 --> 01:27:32.113
TOPIC OF HEALTH CARE COSTS

01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:33.314
GROWTH IN THE SOURCE OF

01:27:33.381 --> 01:27:34.882
HEALTHCARE COST GROWTH. SO

01:27:34.949 --> 01:27:36.384
FOLKS ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR

01:27:36.451 --> 01:27:38.219
WITH THESE NUMBERS. ON MY

01:27:38.286 --> 01:27:39.387
SCREEN IS VERY BLURRY SO I

01:27:39.454 --> 01:27:40.688
ACTUALLY CAN'T EVEN SEE THEM

01:27:40.755 --> 01:27:42.123
BUT WE SPEND A LOT ON

01:27:42.190 --> 01:27:44.258
HEALTHCARE IN THE AGGREGATE AS

01:27:44.325 --> 01:27:46.427
A PERCENT SEVENTEEN POINT 7% OF

01:27:46.494 --> 01:27:49.564
GDP. AND NEARLY ARE OVER ELEVEN

01:27:49.631 --> 01:27:51.499
THOUSAND PER PERSON. SECOND

01:27:51.566 --> 01:27:56.704
FLIGHT. OUR NEXT SLIDE. OKAY ON

01:27:56.771 --> 01:27:59.040
THIS FIGURE AT YOU CAN SEE THE

01:27:59.107 --> 01:28:01.643
TRENDS IN HEALTH CARE

01:28:01.709 --> 01:28:04.245
EXPENDITURES PER CAPITA AS WELL

01:28:04.312 --> 01:28:07.415
AS I HEALTHCARE SPENDING AS A

01:28:07.482 --> 01:28:10.551
PERCENT OF GDP. SUIT IF YOU

01:28:10.618 --> 01:28:12.020
LOOK AT HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES

01:28:12.086 --> 01:28:13.688
PER CAPITA NO SURPRISE AND

01:28:13.755 --> 01:28:15.123
HEALTH YOU KNOW THAT THE BIG

01:28:15.189 --> 01:28:16.724
ISSUE IN THE U. S. HEALTHCARE

01:28:16.791 --> 01:28:20.395
ECONOMY IS KIND OF THE-RELENTLESS RISE OF HEALTHCARE

01:28:20.461 --> 01:28:21.963
SPENDING PER CAPITA YEAR OVER

01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:25.066
YEAR IT GROWS THE LINE SHOWS US

01:28:25.133 --> 01:28:25.600
YOU KNOW WHAT SOME OF THE

01:28:25.667 --> 01:28:26.601
OTHERS SPEAKERS HAVE TALKED

01:28:26.668 --> 01:28:27.969
ABOUT. NOT ONLY IS HEALTHCARE

01:28:28.036 --> 01:28:29.904
SPENDING GROWING BUT IT'S

01:28:29.971 --> 01:28:32.006
GROWING AS A PERCENTAGE OF GDP

01:28:32.073 --> 01:28:33.141
SO WE'RE DEVOTING MORE OF OUR

01:28:33.207 --> 01:28:35.510
RESOURCES TO HEALTHCARE OVER

01:28:35.576 --> 01:28:37.912
TIME. ABOUT SLIGHTLY MORE

01:28:37.979 --> 01:28:39.013
SUBTLE POINT I WANNA MAKE WITH

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:41.649
THIS AN WITH THE SLIDE IS TO

01:28:41.716 --> 01:28:42.283
REALLY THINK ABOUT THE

01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:44.285
DIFFERENCE. BETWEEN THE LEVEL

01:28:44.352 --> 01:28:46.187
AND THE GROWTH OF SPENDING.

01:28:46.254 --> 01:28:48.389
RIGHT SO IF WE LOOK AT THE

01:28:48.456 --> 01:28:50.725
LEVEL OF SPENDING AND IF WE

01:28:50.792 --> 01:28:52.360
THINK ABOUT AN INTERVENTION.

01:28:52.427 --> 01:28:54.562
THAT DECREASED THE LEVEL OF

01:28:54.629 --> 01:28:56.664
SPENDING IN A GIVEN YEAR. THAT

01:28:56.731 --> 01:28:57.899
WOULD BE NICE WE WOULD REDUCE

01:28:57.965 --> 01:28:59.934
OUR HEALTHCARE COSTS COULD.

01:29:00.001 --> 01:29:01.069
REDUCE THEIR HEALTHCARE COSTS

01:29:01.135 --> 01:29:02.837
FOR THAT YEAR. BUT THAT'S NOT

01:29:02.904 --> 01:29:03.604
REALLY GOING TO SOLVE OUR

01:29:03.671 --> 01:29:05.440
PROBLEM THAT'S GOING TO IF WE

01:29:05.506 --> 01:29:07.375
DON'T ADDRESS THE COST GROWTH

01:29:07.442 --> 01:29:09.143
WE'RE GOING TO BE SPENDING FROM

01:29:09.210 --> 01:29:10.712
A WE'RE GOING TO RESUME TO OUR

01:29:10.778 --> 01:29:12.480
OLD LEVELS OF HEALTHCARE COST

01:29:12.547 --> 01:29:14.215
GROWTH. FROM THAT NEW LOWER

01:29:14.282 --> 01:29:15.950
LEVEL SO ECONOMIST THINK ABOUT

01:29:16.017 --> 01:29:18.419
THAT WELL THAT'S A ONE TIME FIX

01:29:18.486 --> 01:29:20.321
BUT AS A ONE TIME INTERVENTION

01:29:20.388 --> 01:29:22.090
WHAT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING FOR

01:29:22.156 --> 01:29:23.024
IT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT

01:29:23.091 --> 01:29:24.892
HEALTHCARE COSTS IS HOW CAN WE

01:29:24.959 --> 01:29:26.994
SLOW THE RATE OF GROWTH OF

01:29:27.061 --> 01:29:33.067
HEALTH EXPENDITURES. NEXT SLIDE.

01:29:33.134 --> 01:29:34.936
OKAY AND WHAT HOW AND I'D LIKE

01:29:35.002 --> 01:29:36.237
YOU TO IT- I'D LIKE TO

01:29:36.304 --> 01:29:37.605
ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT

01:29:37.672 --> 01:29:39.307
THE COST PROBLEM. YOU KNOW

01:29:39.373 --> 01:29:40.541
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY

01:29:40.608 --> 01:29:42.076
THAN YOU THOUGHT ABOUT BEFORE

01:29:42.143 --> 01:29:43.010
WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE COST

01:29:43.077 --> 01:29:44.245
PROBLEM I THINK OF TWO

01:29:44.312 --> 01:29:46.681
PROBLEMS. THE FIRST IS A VALUE

01:29:46.748 --> 01:29:48.282
PROBLEM AND THE SECOND IS THE

01:29:48.349 --> 01:29:50.218
AFFORDABILITY PROBLEM. SO THE

01:29:50.284 --> 01:29:52.220
VALUE PROBLEM IS THE FOLLOWING

01:29:52.286 --> 01:29:53.387
SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT OUR

01:29:53.454 --> 01:29:55.089
HEALTH CARE SPENDING WHAT WE

01:29:55.156 --> 01:29:56.624
REALLY WANT TO THINK ABOUT IS

01:29:56.691 --> 01:29:58.259
DOES THE BENEFIT THAT WE GAIN

01:29:58.326 --> 01:29:59.827
FROM HEALTH CARE EXCEED THE

01:29:59.894 --> 01:30:02.196
PRODUCT COST US OF PRODUCING

01:30:02.263 --> 01:30:04.298
THOSE SERVICES. SO WE WANT TO

01:30:04.365 --> 01:30:05.900
THINK ABOUT KIND OF OUR BANG

01:30:05.967 --> 01:30:07.001
FOR OUR BUCK WHAT ARE WE

01:30:07.068 --> 01:30:08.035
GETTING FROM HEALTH CARE

01:30:08.102 --> 01:30:09.470
SPENDING. IN THIS IS AN

01:30:09.537 --> 01:30:11.072
IMPORTANT CONCEPT IN THE U. S.

01:30:11.139 --> 01:30:12.974
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM BECAUSE- YOU

01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:14.275
KNOW WE'VE GOT. TONS OF

01:30:14.342 --> 01:30:15.977
PHENOMENAL YOU KNOW THINGS

01:30:16.043 --> 01:30:17.578
TECHNOLOGY SERVICES THAT ARE

01:30:17.645 --> 01:30:19.313
GOOD FOR PATIENTS. BUT WE'VE

01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:21.082
ALSO GOT YOU KNOW OTHER THINGS

01:30:21.149 --> 01:30:22.650
WE HAVE LOTS OF EVIDENCE OF

01:30:22.717 --> 01:30:25.052
WHAT PEOPLE CALL LOW VALUE CARE

01:30:25.119 --> 01:30:26.988
RATES SO THAT. CARE FOR WHICH

01:30:27.054 --> 01:30:28.990
THE COST YOU EITHER SLIGHTLY OR

01:30:29.056 --> 01:30:31.225
VASTLY EXCEEDS THE BENEFITS-

01:30:31.292 --> 01:30:32.894
AND WE ALSO HAVE LOTS OF

01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:34.862
EVIDENCE OF NOT PROVIDING HIGH

01:30:34.929 --> 01:30:37.498
VALUE CARE. SO OUR COST PROBLEM

01:30:37.565 --> 01:30:38.766
IS NOT REALLY A PROBLEM OF JUST

01:30:38.833 --> 01:30:41.002
LIKE DOING LESS OR SPENDING

01:30:41.068 --> 01:30:43.504
LESS IT'S DEEPER THAN THAT AND

01:30:43.571 --> 01:30:44.405
YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY IT'S A

01:30:44.472 --> 01:30:45.506
LITTLE BIT HARDER THAN THAT

01:30:45.573 --> 01:30:47.575
IT'S KIND OF. RE ORGANIZING OUR

01:30:47.642 --> 01:30:49.443
CARE TO MOVE AWAY FROM LOW

01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:51.012
VALUE CARE AND TOWARDS HIGH

01:30:51.078 --> 01:30:55.349
VALUE CARE. I'LL GIVE YOU SOME

01:30:55.416 --> 01:30:55.917
EXAMPLES OF THAT IN THE NEXT

01:30:55.983 --> 01:30:57.051
SLIDE. THE PROBLEM YOU KNOW IF

01:30:57.118 --> 01:30:58.786
WE PULL THE COST PROBLEM APART

01:30:58.853 --> 01:30:59.687
AND YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT

01:30:59.754 --> 01:31:00.888
THIS ALREADY THIS MORNING AND

01:31:00.955 --> 01:31:01.923
SOME YOU KNOW GREAT EXAMPLES OF

01:31:01.989 --> 01:31:04.292
THIS. IS YOU KNOW IT OUR ISSUES

01:31:04.358 --> 01:31:06.561
OF AFFORDABILITY SO THE THOUGHT

01:31:06.627 --> 01:31:07.995
EXPERIMENT I'D LIKE YOU TO YOU

01:31:08.062 --> 01:31:10.131
KNOW CONSIDER. IS YOU KNOW I

01:31:10.198 --> 01:31:11.432
TALKED IN THE LAST SIDE ABOUT-

01:31:11.499 --> 01:31:12.733
WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO DO IS

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:14.368
SLOW THE RATE OF GROWTH OF

01:31:14.435 --> 01:31:16.070
HEALTH CARE SPENDING. NOW I'M

01:31:16.137 --> 01:31:17.805
SAYING WE WANT TO DO IN A GOOD

01:31:17.872 --> 01:31:18.673
WAY INA WAY THAT PRESERVES

01:31:18.739 --> 01:31:21.075
VALUE. BUT EVEN IF WE SLOW THE

01:31:21.142 --> 01:31:22.877
RATE OF GROWTH OF HEALTH CARE

01:31:22.944 --> 01:31:24.879
SPENDING WE'RE STILL GONNA HAVE

01:31:24.946 --> 01:31:26.447
AFFORDABILITY PROBLEM RIGHT SO

01:31:26.514 --> 01:31:27.748
RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW HE HAD WITH

01:31:27.815 --> 01:31:29.483

01:31:35.823 --> 01:31:37.291
OVER TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:31:37.358 --> 01:31:38.459
THE MEDIAN INCOME IN THE U. S.

01:31:38.526 --> 01:31:40.828
A SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. EVEN

01:31:40.895 --> 01:31:42.163
IF WE CAN SLOW THE RATE OF

01:31:42.230 --> 01:31:43.097
GROWTH OF HEALTHCARE SPENDING

01:31:43.164 --> 01:31:44.532
TOMORROW WE'RE STILL GONNA HAVE

01:31:44.599 --> 01:31:45.833
THIS AFFORDABILITY PROBLEM WE

01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:48.870
STILL HAVE TO MAINTAIN. WAYS TO

01:31:48.936 --> 01:31:51.339
KEEP PEOPLE ON. YOUR PROTECT

01:31:51.405 --> 01:31:53.207

OF VALUE OR IF IT REALLY YOU

01:32:04.352 --> 01:32:05.786
KNOW THINK THROUGH THIS VALUE

01:32:05.853 --> 01:32:07.955
ISSUE. I DO WANT TO PREFACE MY

01:32:08.022 --> 01:32:09.891
COMMENTS BY GIVING YOU EXAMPLES

01:32:09.957 --> 01:32:11.826
OF THAT PARTICULAR SERVICES.

01:32:11.893 --> 01:32:13.861
AND I AM NOT ADVOCATING FOR

01:32:13.928 --> 01:32:15.897
EXAMPLE A BAN ON THE ANNUAL

01:32:15.963 --> 01:32:17.798
EXAM. I'M TRYING TO MAKE YOU

01:32:17.865 --> 01:32:20.268
KIND OF THINK THROUGH- HOW WE

01:32:20.334 --> 01:32:22.737
COULD DO YOU PRIMARY CARE EXAMS

01:32:22.803 --> 01:32:24.372
BETTER OKAY SO THAT MAY BECOME

01:32:24.438 --> 01:32:25.573
A LITTLE MORE CLEAR AFTER I GO

01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:27.608
THROUGH THIS BUT- YOU KNOW WHY

01:32:27.675 --> 01:32:29.010
I'M NOT REALLY FOCUSING ON. ANY

01:32:29.076 --> 01:32:30.411
OF THESE PARTICULAR SERVICES

01:32:30.478 --> 01:32:32.914
FOR. A SPECIFIC POLICY BUT JUST

01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:34.982
TO DEMONSTRATE A CONCEPT. OKAY

01:32:35.049 --> 01:32:36.217
SO WHAT HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT

01:32:36.284 --> 01:32:38.352
VALUE SO WE CAN THINK ABOUT THE

01:32:38.419 --> 01:32:38.886
TYPES OF HEALTH CARE WE

01:32:38.953 --> 01:32:41.355
PROVIDE. AN ARRAY IT ALONG TWO

01:32:41.422 --> 01:32:42.823
DIMENSIONS WE CAN THINK ABOUT

01:32:42.890 --> 01:32:44.992
WHETHER. IT'S EFFECTIVE OR NOT

01:32:45.059 --> 01:32:46.193
YOU KNOW DOESN'T WORK OR

01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:47.695
DOESN'T IT. AND WE CAN THINK

01:32:47.762 --> 01:32:48.729
ABOUT WHETHER IT'S CHEAPER

01:32:48.796 --> 01:32:51.098
EXPENSIVE. RIGHT AND THINGS

01:32:51.165 --> 01:32:52.667
THAT ARE NOT EFFECTIVE. WE

01:32:52.733 --> 01:32:54.201
PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO DO.

01:32:54.268 --> 01:32:56.270
RIGHT SO I'M GONNA PUT THE- AND

01:32:56.337 --> 01:32:57.872
WE DON'T WANT TO DO THEN EVEN

01:32:57.939 --> 01:32:59.173
IF THEY'RE CHEAP. SO I'M GONNA

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:01.542
PUT THE ANNUAL EXAM FOR HEALTHY

01:33:01.609 --> 01:33:03.678
PEOPLE. IN THAT BUCKET THAT IS

01:33:03.744 --> 01:33:04.779
SOMETHING THAT IS NOT

01:33:04.845 --> 01:33:07.014
PARTICULARLY EXPENSIVE. BUT ALL

01:33:07.081 --> 01:33:09.650
THE EVIDENCE WE HAVE SUGGESTS.

01:33:09.717 --> 01:33:11.185
THAT IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY

01:33:11.252 --> 01:33:12.887
EFFECTIVE. THIS IS ONE THAT

01:33:12.954 --> 01:33:15.456
REALLY. STRIKES AT THE HEART OF

01:33:15.523 --> 01:33:16.691
PEOPLE THEY FEEL VERY

01:33:16.757 --> 01:33:18.559
PROTECTIVE OF THE ANNUAL EXAM.

01:33:18.626 --> 01:33:19.994
SO I'M NOT SAYING YOU SHOULDN'T

01:33:20.061 --> 01:33:21.462
GO TO YOUR DOCTOR AND SAYING.

01:33:21.529 --> 01:33:23.230

01:33:28.469 --> 01:33:29.837
RECOMMENDED SCREENINGS YOU KNOW

01:33:29.904 --> 01:33:31.539
THROUGH OTHER MECHANISMS. WE

01:33:31.605 --> 01:33:33.007
HAVE VERY LITTLE EVIDENCE THAT

01:33:33.074 --> 01:33:35.343
THIS ANNUAL EXAM IS A IS A

01:33:35.409 --> 01:33:37.144
WORTHWHILE. MAYBE WE WANT TO

01:33:37.211 --> 01:33:39.113
REDO THE ANNUAL EXAM FOCUS THE

01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:41.182
ANNUAL EXAM USE THE ANNUAL EXAM

BETTER BUT AND IT'S YOU KNOW

01:33:42.717 --> 01:33:44.952
KIND OF CURRENT FORM- IT IS AT.

01:33:45.019 --> 01:33:46.988
A LOW VALUE SERVICE. WE HAVE

01:33:47.054 --> 01:33:48.322
SERVICES THAT ARE NOT EFFECTIVE

01:33:48.389 --> 01:33:49.790
AND THEY ARE EXPENSIVE THOSE

01:33:49.857 --> 01:33:51.659
ARE THINGS THAT WE WANT TO GET-

01:33:51.726 --> 01:33:52.426
WOULD WONDER WHO REALLY THINK

01:33:52.493 --> 01:33:53.694
TWICE ABOUT. YOU CAN THINK

01:33:53.761 --> 01:33:57.531
ABOUT PCI- FOR PEOPLE WITH

01:33:57.598 --> 01:33:58.733
STABLE ORDINARY ARTERY DISEASE.

01:33:58.799 --> 01:34:00.301
IF ARE HAVE A HEART ATTACK IN

THERE IS A VERY LARGE CLINICAL

01:34:10.344 --> 01:34:11.912
TRIAL THAT SUGGESTED THAT

01:34:11.979 --> 01:34:13.147
OUTCOMES FOR THESE PATIENTS

01:34:13.214 --> 01:34:13.848
GETTING THIS EXPENSIVE

01:34:13.914 --> 01:34:16.517
PROCEDURE. WERE NOT BETTER THAN

01:34:16.584 --> 01:34:18.019
AND OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS WHO

01:34:18.085 --> 01:34:19.587
DIDN'T GET THE PROCEDURE SO

01:34:19.653 --> 01:34:20.221
THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING

01:34:20.287 --> 01:34:22.123
THAT'S EFFECTIVE. I'M SORRY

01:34:22.189 --> 01:34:23.491
THAT IS NOT VERY EFFECTIVE IN

01:34:23.557 --> 01:34:24.792
IS EXPENSIVE YOU KNOW SEEMS

01:34:24.859 --> 01:34:25.826
LIKE THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF

01:34:25.893 --> 01:34:27.962
THINGS WE'D LIKE TO DO LESS OF.

01:34:28.029 --> 01:34:29.330
IT WE CAN ALSO THINK ABOUT

01:34:29.397 --> 01:34:31.532
THINGS THAT ARE. EFFECTIVE AND

01:34:31.599 --> 01:34:33.434
CHEAP SO A GREAT EXAMPLE OF

01:34:33.501 --> 01:34:34.301
THIS IS SCREENING FOR

01:34:34.368 --> 01:34:36.704
COLORECTAL CANCER CANCER WE

01:34:36.771 --> 01:34:37.638
HAVE MANY DIFFERENT MODALITIES

01:34:37.705 --> 01:34:38.672
OR SEVERAL DIFFERENT MODALITIES

01:34:38.739 --> 01:34:39.673
FOR SCREENING FOR COLORECTAL

01:34:39.740 --> 01:34:41.909
CANCER. THERE IS A FICKLE BASED

01:34:41.976 --> 01:34:43.577
ATTESTED THAT IS VERY CHEAP

01:34:43.644 --> 01:34:45.246
VERY EFFECTIVE IT'S ONE OF THE

01:34:45.312 --> 01:34:46.847
VERY FEW PREVENTIVE SERVICES.

01:34:46.914 --> 01:34:49.550
THAT IS ACTUALLY COST SAVING.

01:34:49.617 --> 01:34:52.053
WHAT DO WE DO IN THE U. S. WE

01:34:52.119 --> 01:34:52.553
ASK THAT WE ACTUALLY DO

01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:54.555
COLONOSCOPY WHICH IS ACTUALLY.

01:34:54.622 --> 01:34:56.924
IT'S EFFECTIVE AND IT IS EVEN

01:34:56.991 --> 01:35:00.461
BY. A RELEVANCE AT AT METRICS

01:35:00.528 --> 01:35:02.930
COST EFFECTIVE. BUT IT'S NOT

01:35:02.997 --> 01:35:04.231
COST SAVING LIKE THE OTHER

01:35:04.298 --> 01:35:07.701
TESTS RIGHT SO EVEN IN THE C.

01:35:07.768 --> 01:35:11.205
WHERE WE HAVE. A AND EFFECTIVE

01:35:11.272 --> 01:35:13.207
SERVE. WE OFFER TO USE THEM.

01:35:13.274 --> 01:35:14.642
AND THEN RE WHETHER HITS ROAD

01:35:14.708 --> 01:35:16.243
IN THE DIFFICULT THIS. ARE ARE

01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:18.045
THINGS THAT IF. IN THEIR- RIGHT

01:35:18.112 --> 01:35:19.647
SO PROBLEM DRUG PERHAPS WERE

01:35:19.713 --> 01:35:20.815
THE BEST EXAMPLE OF THIS

01:35:20.881 --> 01:35:22.216
INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE.

01:35:22.283 --> 01:35:24.518
INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE IN THOSE

01:35:24.585 --> 01:35:25.920
ARE DIFFICULT DECISIONS THAT

01:35:25.986 --> 01:35:30.491
THAT THAT WE NEED TO MAKE. OKAY

01:35:30.558 --> 01:35:32.860
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. OKAY SO

01:35:32.927 --> 01:35:34.595
THERE IS A- I'LL YOU LISTEN

01:35:34.662 --> 01:35:35.930
ABOUT WHAT DRIVES GROWTH IN

01:35:35.996 --> 01:35:37.698
HEALTHCARE SPENDING THERE IS A

01:35:37.765 --> 01:35:39.500
IN AN ACADEMIC LITERATURE.

01:35:39.567 --> 01:35:41.469
LOOKING AT OVER THE LONG RUN

01:35:41.535 --> 01:35:42.903
WHAT DRIVES GROWTH IN

01:35:42.970 --> 01:35:43.804
HEALTHCARE SPENDING AND

01:35:43.871 --> 01:35:44.939
REMEMBER WE'RE NOT THINKING

01:35:45.005 --> 01:35:45.739
ABOUT LEVELS WERE THINKING

01:35:45.806 --> 01:35:47.141
ABOUT GROWTH RIGHT ARCHITECT

01:35:47.208 --> 01:35:48.442
BUT THE GROUP. GROWTH IS THE

01:35:48.509 --> 01:35:49.276
THING THAT WE REALLY CARE

01:35:49.343 --> 01:35:51.245
ABOUT. AND I THINK THE ACADEMIC

01:35:51.312 --> 01:35:52.680
LITERATURE IS SURPRISING TO

01:35:52.746 --> 01:35:54.148
FOLKS AND HOW AND WHAT IS THIS

01:35:54.215 --> 01:35:55.816
LITERATURE LOOK LIKE WELL. WHEN

01:35:55.883 --> 01:35:57.384
IN THE ACADEMIC THEY LOOK AT

01:35:57.451 --> 01:35:59.720
YOU KNOW TRENDS OVER TIME AND-

01:35:59.787 --> 01:36:01.555
HEALTH CARE SPENDING. AND THEN

01:36:01.622 --> 01:36:02.523
THEY LOOK AT THE THINGS THAT

01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:03.491
THEY CAN MEASURE RIGHT LIKELY

01:36:03.557 --> 01:36:05.326
WHAT ARE THE PRIMARY CULPRITS

01:36:05.392 --> 01:36:06.827
WATER THAT. YOU KNOW THINGS

01:36:06.894 --> 01:36:07.995
THAT PEOPLE POINT TO IN THE

01:36:08.062 --> 01:36:09.964
CONTEXT OF A HEALTHCARE COST

01:36:10.030 --> 01:36:11.031
GROWTH WILL BEGIN TO GET THE

01:36:11.098 --> 01:36:12.800
AGING OF THE POPULATION YOU

01:36:12.867 --> 01:36:14.935
KNOW CHANGES IN PRICE INCREASES

01:36:15.002 --> 01:36:18.906
IN INSURANCE- HE HAS IT TO A

01:36:18.973 --> 01:36:20.074
CERTAIN EXTENT THINGS ABOUT.

01:36:20.141 --> 01:36:21.675
ABOUT YOU KNOW THAT IF WE CAN

01:36:21.742 --> 01:36:23.444
MEASURE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS WE

01:36:23.511 --> 01:36:25.412
CONTROL FOR THE THINGS THAT WE

01:36:25.479 --> 01:36:27.248
CAN MEASURE. AND THEN WE SEE

01:36:27.314 --> 01:36:28.149
HOW MUCH IS LEFT IN THE

01:36:28.215 --> 01:36:29.917
RESIDUAL. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT

01:36:29.984 --> 01:36:30.985
THE SLIDE YOU CAN SEE THERE

01:36:31.051 --> 01:36:32.153
SEVERAL DIFFERENT STUDIES IN

01:36:32.219 --> 01:36:33.120
SEVERAL OF THE THINGS THAT

01:36:33.187 --> 01:36:37.324
PEOPLE OFTEN TALK ABOUT. FOR

01:36:37.391 --> 01:36:37.825
EXAMPLE THE AGING OF THE

01:36:37.892 --> 01:36:38.492
POPULATION. OVER THAT TIME.

01:36:38.559 --> 01:36:39.527
WHICH WERE IN ADMITTEDLY WAS A

01:36:39.593 --> 01:36:40.928
WHILE AGO AGING OF THE

01:36:40.995 --> 01:36:42.530
POPULATION ACTUALLY HAD A VERY

01:36:42.596 --> 01:36:43.931
SMALL CONTRIBUTION TO GROWTH

01:36:43.998 --> 01:36:45.266
AND HEALTH CARE SPENDING.

01:36:45.332 --> 01:36:47.334
INCREASES IN INSURANCE RIGHT

01:36:47.401 --> 01:36:49.069
LIKE. THE ACT THAT YOU KNOW

01:36:49.136 --> 01:36:50.304
ADDING ONE MORE INSURANCE

01:36:50.371 --> 01:36:52.273
PERSON TO THE INSURANCE ROLES-

01:36:52.339 --> 01:36:53.574
IN THE SPREAD OF THIRD PARTY

01:36:53.641 --> 01:36:55.342
PAYMENT HAD A RELATIVELY SMALL

01:36:55.409 --> 01:36:57.044
CONTRIBUTION TO HEALTH CARE

01:36:57.111 --> 01:36:59.213
SPENDING. WHAT THAT'S THE SAME

01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:00.447
THING AS SAYING WELL THE

01:37:00.514 --> 01:37:02.183
RESIDUAL WAS VERY LARGE THE

01:37:02.249 --> 01:37:03.884
PORTION WE COULDN'T EXPLAIN IS

01:37:03.951 --> 01:37:06.187
VERY LARGE. AND HOW IT WOULD

01:37:06.253 --> 01:37:07.688
HOW COMMON IS THINK ABOUT THAT

01:37:07.755 --> 01:37:08.789
IS YOU KNOW WE KIND OF PUT THIS

01:37:08.856 --> 01:37:10.524
IN A BUCKET OF TECHNOLOGY.

01:37:10.591 --> 01:37:12.126
THAT'S BASICALLY SAYING WE'RE

01:37:12.193 --> 01:37:14.662
DOING MORE STUFF WE HAD NEW

01:37:14.728 --> 01:37:16.530
THINGS WE HAVE NEW SERVICES.%

01:37:16.597 --> 01:37:17.898
AND WE ARE TAKING THIS THING

01:37:17.965 --> 01:37:19.934
SERVICES AND APPLYING THEM AND

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.502
USING THEM IN NEW WAYS NEW

01:37:21.569 --> 01:37:23.504
POPULATION NEW PEOPLE ETCETERA

01:37:23.571 --> 01:37:24.772
RIGHT SO THE RESIDUALS

01:37:24.838 --> 01:37:26.273
TECHNOLOGY. AND MANY OF THE

01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:28.275
STUDIES AGREE. THAT THE THAT

01:37:28.342 --> 01:37:29.510
THAT TECH NOT THAT BIG

01:37:29.577 --> 01:37:31.345
TECHNOLOGY BUCKET IS THE

01:37:31.412 --> 01:37:33.147
BIGGEST CON. CONTRIBUTOR TO

01:37:33.214 --> 01:37:34.815
HEALTH CARE SPENDING. OKAY SO

01:37:34.882 --> 01:37:35.916
IT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DATES

01:37:35.983 --> 01:37:37.184
ON THE STUDIES YOU'LL BE LIKE

01:37:37.251 --> 01:37:38.085
OH THOSE ARE VERY OLD STUDIES

01:37:38.152 --> 01:37:40.020
KATE- AND- YOU KNOW YOU WOULD

01:37:40.087 --> 01:37:42.056
BE RIGHT TO SAY THAT. I DO WANT

01:37:42.122 --> 01:37:43.657
TO POINT OUT TWO THINGS WHICH I

01:37:43.724 --> 01:37:45.693
THINK ARE OF GROWING IMPORTANCE

01:37:45.759 --> 01:37:47.494
I THINK THE- THRUST OF THIS

01:37:47.561 --> 01:37:49.697
LITERATURE. IS A RIGHT RIGHT IN

01:37:49.763 --> 01:37:50.898
THE SENSE THAT IT'S STILL

01:37:50.965 --> 01:37:52.299
TECHNOLOGY IT'S SILL WERE

01:37:52.366 --> 01:37:54.735
DOING MORE STUFF- BUT THE TWO

01:37:54.802 --> 01:37:56.570
FACTORS THAT I THINK ARE- YOU

01:37:56.637 --> 01:37:57.438
KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:37:57.504 --> 01:37:59.039
IMPORTANT NOW. ONE IS THE AGING

01:37:59.106 --> 01:38:00.774
OF THE POPULATION IF YOU REALLY

01:38:00.841 --> 01:38:03.811
LOOK CLOSELY AT THE- AT. THE

01:38:03.877 --> 01:38:05.613
FORECAST FOR MEDICARE SPENDING

01:38:05.679 --> 01:38:07.248
YOU CAN SEE THIS STORY OVER

01:38:07.314 --> 01:38:09.950
TIME- THE ACTUARIES WHO

01:38:10.017 --> 01:38:12.553
FORECAST MEDICARE SPENDING- ARE

01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:14.121
ATTRIBUTING A GREATER PORTION

01:38:14.188 --> 01:38:15.389
OF SPENDING GROWTH TO THE-

01:38:15.456 --> 01:38:17.024
AGING OF THE POPULATION. IT'S

01:38:17.091 --> 01:38:18.459
STILL CERTAINLY DOESN'T WORK

01:38:18.525 --> 01:38:20.160
THAT TECHNOLOGY ARGUMENT BUT

01:38:20.227 --> 01:38:21.962
IT'S BECOMING MORE IMPORTANT.

01:38:22.029 --> 01:38:23.297
ON THE OTHER THING THAT I THINK

01:38:23.364 --> 01:38:24.298
IS VERY IMPORTANT TOUCH ON A

01:38:24.365 --> 01:38:24.832
LITTLE BIT MORE IN THIS

01:38:24.898 --> 01:38:26.166
PRESENTATION AND I THINK YOU'VE

01:38:26.233 --> 01:38:26.867
ALREADY HAD A LITTLE BIT

01:38:26.934 --> 01:38:28.636
DISCUSSION. OF DISCUSSION ON IS

01:38:28.702 --> 01:38:31.672
PRICES. RIGHT SO PRICES I THINK

01:38:31.739 --> 01:38:32.840
YOU DO TO CONSULT INDUSTRY

01:38:32.906 --> 01:38:38.078
CONSOLIDATION. UP PRICES ARE.

01:38:38.145 --> 01:38:38.679
GROWING IN WAYS THAT THEY WERE

01:38:38.746 --> 01:38:39.313
NOT GROWING DURING THAT TIME.

01:38:39.380 --> 01:38:44.451
OF THE STATE. ON SLIDE PLEASE.

01:38:44.518 --> 01:38:46.787
OKAY A. I. MANAGING OF MANY OF

01:38:46.854 --> 01:38:47.388
YOUR PANELISTS WILL HAVE THEIR

01:38:47.454 --> 01:38:49.089
FAVORITE MARKET CONSOLIDATION

01:38:49.156 --> 01:38:51.458
SLIDE AND HERE'S MINE- THIS IS

01:38:51.525 --> 01:38:53.294
RESEARCH THAT I'VE DONE WITH

01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:56.030
MY- COLLEAGUES AND DAN KESSLER

01:38:56.096 --> 01:38:57.898
AND LAUREN BAKER BOTH ALSO AT

01:38:57.965 --> 01:39:00.200
SANFORD. AND WHAT WE'RE

01:39:00.267 --> 01:39:02.569
LOOKING AT HERE IS- MARKET

01:39:02.636 --> 01:39:04.238
CONSOLIDATION AND HOSPITAL

01:39:04.305 --> 01:39:07.241
SPENDING N. THIS PAPER THE

01:39:07.308 --> 01:39:09.109
FOCUS OF THIS PAPER WAS

01:39:09.176 --> 01:39:11.111
VERTICAL INTEGRATION HOSPITAL'S

01:39:11.178 --> 01:39:14.048
MERGING- WITH- HOSPITALS IN A

01:39:14.114 --> 01:39:15.582
MERGING OR PURCHASING PHYSICIAN

01:39:15.649 --> 01:39:17.718
PRACTICES AND THAT BAR ON THE

01:39:17.785 --> 01:39:19.520
LEFT YOU CAN SEE THAT SAY A

01:39:19.586 --> 01:39:21.622
PERCENTAGE PRICING CHANGE FOR A

01:39:21.689 --> 01:39:23.757
ONE PERCENTAGE- ONE STANDARD

01:39:23.824 --> 01:39:27.428
DEVIATION INCREASE. IN THAT IN

01:39:27.494 --> 01:39:30.998
VERTICAL AND CONSOLIDATION IN A

01:39:31.065 --> 01:39:32.433
HEALTH CARE MARKET LEADS TO

01:39:32.499 --> 01:39:33.901
HIGHER SPENDING REMEMBER

01:39:33.967 --> 01:39:35.669
SPENDING IS PRICE TIMES

01:39:35.736 --> 01:39:37.171
QUANTITY SO EITHER OF THOSE

01:39:37.237 --> 01:39:39.073
THINGS COULD BE GOING UP THERE.

01:39:39.139 --> 01:39:40.507
TO GO OVER TO THAT RIGHT BAR

01:39:40.574 --> 01:39:42.376
THE LIGHT BLUE BAR THAT IS

01:39:42.443 --> 01:39:44.611
COMPARING DEACON VERTICAL

01:39:44.678 --> 01:39:46.213
CONSOLIDATION TO HORIZONTAL

01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:47.881
CONSOLIDATION TO HOSPITALS

01:39:47.948 --> 01:39:49.350
GETTING TOGETHER AND MERGING

01:39:49.416 --> 01:39:50.551
AND YOU KNOW HORIZONTAL

01:39:50.617 --> 01:39:52.553
CONSOLIDATION ALSO IN A HAS A

01:39:52.619 --> 01:39:54.221
VERY BIG THAT AFFECT ON PRICES.

01:39:54.288 --> 01:39:56.590
WHEN YOU GO OVER TO THE RIGHT A

01:39:56.657 --> 01:39:58.092
YOU CAN SEE THE EFFECT AND

01:39:58.158 --> 01:40:00.094
QUANTITY THE LAST FIGURE WITH

01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:01.729
PRICE TIMES QUANTITY SPENDING

01:40:01.795 --> 01:40:04.164
GOING UP THE RIGHT IS QUANTITY

01:40:04.231 --> 01:40:06.100
ONLY- THIS IS BASICALLY SAYING

01:40:06.166 --> 01:40:07.368
WELL THE RELATIVELY LITTLE

01:40:07.434 --> 01:40:08.602
EFFECT AND QUANTITY OF THESE

01:40:08.669 --> 01:40:10.504
TYPES OF CHANGES IN PROVIDER

01:40:10.571 --> 01:40:12.706
ORGANIZATION AND MARKETS SO YOU

01:40:12.773 --> 01:40:14.007
KNOW KIND OF BY DEFAULT IT

01:40:14.074 --> 01:40:15.642
LOOKS LIKE IT WAS PRICES. RIGHT

01:40:15.709 --> 01:40:16.844
SO THERE ARE LOTS OF THE

01:40:16.910 --> 01:40:17.978
GROWING LITERATURE LOTS OF

01:40:18.045 --> 01:40:19.780
STUDIES THIS IS A VERY

01:40:19.847 --> 01:40:21.248
IMPORTANT PROBLEM FOR A HEALTH

01:40:21.315 --> 01:40:23.217
CARE SYSTEM NOW IN PART BECAUSE

01:40:23.283 --> 01:40:24.685
ONCE WE DO CONSOLIDATION IT'S

01:40:24.752 --> 01:40:27.121
HARD TO DO IT RIGHT S OF THE

01:40:27.187 --> 01:40:28.989
CONSOLIDATION INSPECTS AFFECTS

01:40:29.056 --> 01:40:30.724
SOME PRICES IMPORTANT WHEN NO I

01:40:30.791 --> 01:40:31.925
WANT TO MAKE ON THIS STUDY IS

01:40:31.992 --> 01:40:34.194
THAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT HOSPITAL

01:40:34.261 --> 01:40:35.963
ADMISSIONS- AND IT'S A VERY

01:40:36.029 --> 01:40:37.564
IMPORTANT AND THINKING ABOUT-

01:40:37.631 --> 01:40:39.133
HOSPITAL CONSOLIDATION IN

01:40:39.199 --> 01:40:43.670
HOSPITAL INTEGRATION. ALSO TO

01:40:43.737 --> 01:40:44.505
THINK ABOUT OUT ASIAN HOSPITAL

01:40:44.571 --> 01:40:45.038
SERVICES THERE'S A LAW OF

01:40:45.105 --> 01:40:47.107
ACTION THERE TO WELL. A NEXT

01:40:47.174 --> 01:40:51.078
SLIDE PLEASE. OKAY SO HERE I

01:40:51.145 --> 01:40:52.379
WANNA I WANNA MAKE A POINT

01:40:52.446 --> 01:40:55.215
ABOUT- EXPANSIONS INSURANCE AND

01:40:55.282 --> 01:40:56.850
INSURANCE COVERAGE AN OUT OF

01:40:56.917 --> 01:40:58.218
POCKET SPENDING SO WHAT I'VE

01:40:58.285 --> 01:41:00.521
DONE HERE IS I'VE PLOTTED-

01:41:00.587 --> 01:41:02.890
NATIONAL HEALTH EXPENDITURES BY

01:41:02.956 --> 01:41:04.925
A FUNDING SOURCE AND ON THE

01:41:04.992 --> 01:41:08.429
BOTTOM IN THAT GRAY AND- I ON

01:41:08.495 --> 01:41:10.197
IN THOSE GRAY BARS YOU CAN SEE

01:41:10.264 --> 01:41:11.965
THE PROPORTION OF HEALTH CARE

01:41:12.032 --> 01:41:13.934
EXPENDITURES THAT ARE FUNDED

01:41:14.001 --> 01:41:16.603
OUT OF POCKET. N. I MEAN WHO AT

01:41:16.670 --> 01:41:18.105
THIS IS A VERY LONG TIME PERIOD

01:41:18.172 --> 01:41:19.039
I THINK THAT NUMBER OVER THERE

01:41:19.106 --> 01:41:20.774
AND THE LEFT ISN'T EARLY

01:41:20.841 --> 01:41:22.075
NINETEEN SIXTIES AND YOU CAN

01:41:22.142 --> 01:41:23.744
SEE THAT PROPORTION OF HEALTH

01:41:23.811 --> 01:41:26.980
EXPENDITURES THAT IS FUNDED BY

01:41:27.047 --> 01:41:28.715
OUT OF POCKET PAYMENTS NON

01:41:28.782 --> 01:41:30.751
INSURED PAYMENTS HAS ACTUALLY

01:41:30.818 --> 01:41:32.719
BEEN DECLINING OVER TIME SO THE

01:41:32.786 --> 01:41:34.521
DECLINE HAS BEEN LESS DRAMATIC

01:41:34.588 --> 01:41:36.523
IN RECENT YEARS. BUT IT'S BEEN

01:41:36.590 --> 01:41:39.526
DECLINING- AT THE SAME TIME

01:41:39.593 --> 01:41:40.994
WE'VE HAD PRETTY DRAMATIC

01:41:41.061 --> 01:41:43.397
INCREASES OVER TIME- IN THE

01:41:43.464 --> 01:41:45.332
PROPORTION OF EXPENDITURES THIS

01:41:45.399 --> 01:41:47.034
ISN'T THE PORTION OF PEOPLE

01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:47.534
THIS IS A PROPORTION OF

01:41:47.601 --> 01:41:49.503
EXPENDITURES THEY'RE COVERED BY

01:41:49.570 --> 01:41:50.771
EITHER PUBLIC OR PRIVATE

01:41:50.838 --> 01:41:52.306
INSURANCE AND IF YOU YOU KNOW

01:41:52.372 --> 01:41:53.474
SQUINT REALLY HARD AT THAT YOU

01:41:53.540 --> 01:41:54.675
CAN SEE THAT MAYBE THERE'S A

01:41:54.741 --> 01:41:56.543
SLIGHTLY BIGGER INCREASE AND-

01:41:56.610 --> 01:41:58.645
PUBLIC INSURANCE. AND PRIVATE

01:41:58.712 --> 01:41:59.980
INSURANCE DURING THIS TIME

01:42:00.047 --> 01:42:01.381
RIGHT SO THIS IS THIS LITTLE

01:42:01.448 --> 01:42:02.216
BIT SURPRISING TO PEOPLE

01:42:02.282 --> 01:42:04.852
BECAUSE WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT OUT

01:42:04.918 --> 01:42:06.987
OF POCKET PAYMENTS AND THAT IS

01:42:07.054 --> 01:42:08.589
ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT OURSELVES

01:42:08.655 --> 01:42:09.790
A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT ON

01:42:09.857 --> 01:42:11.391
THE NEXT SLIDE IT'S ABSOLUTELY

01:42:11.458 --> 01:42:14.495
IMPORTANT BUT REALLY ARE OUT OF

01:42:14.561 --> 01:42:15.429
AND ANOTHER THING I WANT TO

01:42:15.496 --> 01:42:16.597
MAKE A POINT I WANT TO MAKE

01:42:16.663 --> 01:42:18.265
ABOUT THE SLIDE IS WHEN I SAY

01:42:18.332 --> 01:42:19.600
OUT OF POCKET PAYMENTS THESE

01:42:19.666 --> 01:42:20.934
ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE INSURED AND

01:42:21.001 --> 01:42:22.269
PAY FOR SOME OF THEIR SERVICES

01:42:22.336 --> 01:42:23.904
OUT OF POCKET. AS WELL AS

01:42:23.971 --> 01:42:25.305
PEOPLE WHO ARE UNINSURED RIGHT

01:42:25.372 --> 01:42:26.507
SO THERE'S A MIX BETWEEN

01:42:26.573 --> 01:42:28.108
BENEFIT GENEROSITY AND HEALTH

01:42:28.175 --> 01:42:29.743
INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR EXAMPLE

01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:31.211
BENEFIT GENEROSITY COULD BE

01:42:31.278 --> 01:42:33.013
DECLINING AND MORE PEOPLE ARE

01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:34.147
GETTING HEALTH INSURANCE AND

01:42:34.214 --> 01:42:35.582
THAT COULD BE AN OFFSETTING

01:42:35.649 --> 01:42:36.717
EACH OTHER AND IN INTERESTING

01:42:36.783 --> 01:42:38.819
WAYS. BUT THE POINT I WANT TO

01:42:38.886 --> 01:42:39.987
MAKE HERE IS THAT YOU KNOW WE

01:42:40.053 --> 01:42:41.488
TALK A LOT ABOUT OUT OF POCKET

01:42:41.555 --> 01:42:43.690
SPENDING IN OUT OF POCKET

01:42:43.757 --> 01:42:47.828
SPENDING IS ACTUALLY EITHER. AS

01:42:47.895 --> 01:42:48.395
A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL HEALTH

01:42:48.462 --> 01:42:49.062
EXPENDITURE IS THAT GOING TO SO.

01:42:49.129 --> 01:42:50.898
MAY THINGS STATE IN RECENT

01:42:50.964 --> 01:42:52.566
YEARS. THE BIG PROBLEM THE

01:42:52.633 --> 01:42:54.401
ELEPHANT IN THIS ROOM IS TOTAL

01:42:54.468 --> 01:42:57.004
SPENDING- I AND I'M NOT SAYING

01:42:57.070 --> 01:42:58.438
OUT OF POCKET EXPENSE SPENDING

01:42:58.505 --> 01:43:00.240
IS NOT IMPORTANT FOR CONSUMERS.

01:43:00.307 --> 01:43:01.341
BUT I'M SAYING THE THING THAT

01:43:01.408 --> 01:43:02.676
IS DRIVING OUT OF POCKET

01:43:02.743 --> 01:43:04.077
SPENDING FOR CONSUMERS IS TOTAL

01:43:04.144 --> 01:43:05.579
SPENDING. OKAY NEXT SLIDE

01:43:05.646 --> 01:43:10.784
PLEASE. OKAY THIS KIND OF MAKES

01:43:10.851 --> 01:43:12.753
THE SAME POINT CERVANTES TOO

01:43:12.819 --> 01:43:13.554
QUICKLY THIS IS BASICALLY

01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:15.188
SHOWING THAT YOU KNOW OUT OF

01:43:15.255 --> 01:43:17.157
POCKET EXPENDITURES ARE OUR PER

01:43:17.224 --> 01:43:19.493
CAPITA INDEED ARE GOING UP AT

01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:21.662
THE SAME TIME THE SHARE OF A

01:43:21.728 --> 01:43:22.896
EXPENDITURES FINANCE OUT OF

01:43:22.963 --> 01:43:24.798
POCKET IS GOING DOWN ONCE AGAIN

01:43:24.865 --> 01:43:26.133
THAT'S BECAUSE HEALTH CARE

01:43:26.199 --> 01:43:28.068
EXPENDITURES PER CAPITA ARE

01:43:28.135 --> 01:43:29.736
GROWING SO QUICKLY. EXIDE

01:43:29.803 --> 01:43:35.842
PLEASE. AND OKAY SO I WANT TO

01:43:35.909 --> 01:43:36.643
JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

01:43:36.710 --> 01:43:37.778
THE DISTRIBUTION OF SPENDING BY

01:43:37.844 --> 01:43:39.279
SECTOR YOU KNOW HERE WE HAD THE

01:43:39.346 --> 01:43:40.814
BIG THREE ARE REALLY HOSPITAL

01:43:40.881 --> 01:43:43.550
SERVICES AND OFTEN PEOPLE ARE

01:43:43.617 --> 01:43:44.952
SAYS SURPRISE AT THE LARGE

01:43:45.018 --> 01:43:46.486
SHARE SPENDING DEVOTED TO

01:43:46.553 --> 01:43:47.921
HOSPITAL SERVICES IT SOUNDS

01:43:47.988 --> 01:43:49.323
FROM THE QUESTIONS I COULD HEAR

01:43:49.389 --> 01:43:50.757
THAT YOU GUYS PROBABLY ARE NOT

01:43:50.824 --> 01:43:52.993
THAT SURPRISED. BY THAT

01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:54.227
PHYSICIAN SERVICES ALSO

01:43:54.294 --> 01:43:55.762
IMPORTANT PHARMACEUTICALS

01:43:55.829 --> 01:43:57.898
REPRESENT ABOUT 10% OF

01:43:57.965 --> 01:43:59.600
HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES THAT IS

01:43:59.666 --> 01:44:00.601
FOCUSED ON RETAIL

01:44:00.667 --> 01:44:02.869
PHARMACEUTICALS AND INJECTABLES

01:44:02.936 --> 01:44:05.973
ARE IMPORTANT ALSO BUT THEY

01:44:06.039 --> 01:44:07.074
DON'T SHOW UP IN THAT

01:44:07.140 --> 01:44:08.842
PHARMACEUTICALS AND PIECE OF

01:44:08.909 --> 01:44:10.544
THE PIE BECAUSE THEY OUGHT TO

01:44:10.611 --> 01:44:11.812
SHOW UP IN EITHER THE HOSPITAL

01:44:11.878 --> 01:44:14.781
OR THE PHYSICIAN. SERVICES ON

01:44:14.848 --> 01:44:16.850
IT'S HARD TO GET GREAT DATA ON

01:44:16.917 --> 01:44:18.518
WHAT PROPORTION OF HOSPITAL OR

01:44:18.585 --> 01:44:20.020
PHYSICIAN SERVICES YOU KNOW HOW

01:44:20.087 --> 01:44:22.489
ARE DEVOTED TO- INJECTABLE AND

01:44:22.556 --> 01:44:24.157
OTHER TYPES OF DRUGS THAT YOU

01:44:24.224 --> 01:44:26.026
WOULD GET IN- A HOSPITAL OR

01:44:26.093 --> 01:44:27.961
PHYSICIAN'S SETTING- BUT SOME

01:44:28.028 --> 01:44:29.563
PEOPLE OF ESTIMATED THAT MAYBE

01:44:29.630 --> 01:44:29.997
THAT BRINGS UP THE

01:44:30.063 --> 01:44:32.866
PHARMACEUTICAL SHARE AT TWO

01:44:32.933 --> 01:44:33.467
FIFTEEN YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE

01:44:33.533 --> 01:44:37.771
SAY 20% IT HARD TO GET GRADED

01:44:37.838 --> 01:44:41.308
ON THAT. CAN EXCITE. OKAY HERE

01:44:41.375 --> 01:44:42.809
I JUST WANNA TALK A LITTLE BIT

01:44:42.876 --> 01:44:44.077
ABOUT THE GROWTH RATE AND GROW

01:44:44.144 --> 01:44:46.113
YOU KNOW ONCE AGAIN. I STARTED

01:44:46.179 --> 01:44:47.180
BY SAYING THE GROWTH RATE IS

01:44:47.247 --> 01:44:49.182
MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE LEVELS-

01:44:49.249 --> 01:44:51.585
THAT IS A TRUE HERE YOU CAN SEE

01:44:51.652 --> 01:44:52.786
IN OF TRENDS AND THE GROWTH

01:44:52.853 --> 01:44:54.688
RATE OVER TIME. THE NINETIES

01:44:54.755 --> 01:44:58.392
WAS A PERIOD OF LARGE INCREASES

01:44:58.458 --> 01:45:01.528
IN THE- ORDER RAPIDLY RISING

01:45:01.595 --> 01:45:02.763
EXPENDITURES FOR

01:45:02.829 --> 01:45:04.798
PHARMACEUTICALS- THE CURRENTS

01:45:04.865 --> 01:45:06.033
AND A GROWTH RATES ARE OVER

01:45:06.099 --> 01:45:07.968
THERE. ON THE RIGHT IT'S NE

01:45:08.035 --> 01:45:09.069
THING TO KEEP IN MIND AS WELL

01:45:09.136 --> 01:45:10.203
THE GROWTH RATE OF THESE THINGS

01:45:10.270 --> 01:45:11.471
HAS ANOTHER ROUGHLY IN A

01:45:11.538 --> 01:45:12.839
SIMILAR THEY DON'T TO OF EACH

01:45:12.906 --> 01:45:14.508
OF THESE SECTORS. BUT WHEN WE

01:45:14.574 --> 01:45:16.943
APPLY A SIMILAR GROWTH RATE ON

01:45:17.010 --> 01:45:19.579
A VERY LARGE BASE A VERY LARGE

01:45:19.646 --> 01:45:21.448
BASE OF HOSPITAL SPENDING FOR

01:45:21.515 --> 01:45:23.483
EXAMPLE. THAT AND TRANSLATES

01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:25.352
INTO A LOT OF DOLLARS RIGHT SO

01:45:25.419 --> 01:45:26.687
A GOOD AS A YOU KNOW A GROWTH

01:45:26.753 --> 01:45:28.355
RATE ON A SMALL SHARE RELATIVE

01:45:28.422 --> 01:45:29.489
TO A GROWTH RATE ON A LARGE

01:45:29.556 --> 01:45:30.524
SHARE THE SAME GROWTH RATE ON A

01:45:30.590 --> 01:45:33.727
LARGE SHARE. MEANS A DIFFERENT

01:45:33.794 --> 01:45:35.095
THING FOR OVERALL SPENDING.

01:45:35.162 --> 01:45:40.033
OKAY NEXT SLIDE PLAY. AND HERE

01:45:40.100 --> 01:45:42.836
IS SOME INFORMATION THAT THE-

01:45:42.903 --> 01:45:44.104
THE NATIONAL X. HEALTH

01:45:44.171 --> 01:45:46.039
EXPENDITURES FOLKS PUT TOGETHER

01:45:46.106 --> 01:45:49.142
TRYING TO KINDA DECOMPOSE IN TO

01:45:49.209 --> 01:45:51.445
ODD THAT THE HEALTHCARE COST

01:45:51.511 --> 01:45:53.180
GROWTH INTO ONCE AGAIN AGING OF

01:45:53.246 --> 01:45:55.549
THE POPULATION PRICE AND

01:45:55.615 --> 01:45:57.250
QUANTITY AND YOU CAN SEE IN A

01:45:57.317 --> 01:45:58.485
KIND OF IN THE NINETIES OVER

01:45:58.552 --> 01:45:59.553
THERE ON THE LEFT ESPECIALLY

01:45:59.619 --> 01:46:01.188
THAT SECOND BAR FROM THE LEFT

01:46:01.254 --> 01:46:03.290
YOU KNOW THERE IS A PERIOD OF

01:46:03.356 --> 01:46:05.859
RELATIVELY LOW HEALTH CARE

01:46:05.926 --> 01:46:07.861
COSTS GROWTH. BUT DURING THAT

01:46:07.928 --> 01:46:09.129
TIME IT'S INTERESTING WHAT HEAD

01:46:09.196 --> 01:46:11.965
YOU KNOW WHAT HEAD- PRICES WERE

01:46:12.032 --> 01:46:13.467
STILL GROWING BUT QUANTITY

01:46:13.533 --> 01:46:15.669
WASN'T RATE ONCE WE EMERGED

01:46:15.736 --> 01:46:17.137
INTO A TIME PERIOD WHERE

01:46:17.204 --> 01:46:18.739
HEALTHCARE SPENDING GROWTH TOOK

01:46:18.805 --> 01:46:21.174
OFF AGAIN WE WERE MOVING MOVING

01:46:21.241 --> 01:46:23.610
MORE TOWARD MORE TOWARDS

01:46:23.677 --> 01:46:25.545
QUANTITY AND ONCE AGAIN THAT IS

01:46:25.612 --> 01:46:26.980
YOU KNOW QUANTITY IS A BIG

01:46:27.047 --> 01:46:29.316
BROAD CATEGORY OF STUFF GRADING

01:46:29.382 --> 01:46:32.452
OF NEW STUFF- EXISTING AND NEW

01:46:32.519 --> 01:46:33.920
APPLICATIONS FOR EXISTING

01:46:33.987 --> 01:46:36.823
PROCEDURES AND BILLS ETCETERA I

01:46:36.890 --> 01:46:38.625
DO WANT TO ADD ONCE AGAIN BRING

01:46:38.692 --> 01:46:39.426
ATTENTION TO ASIAN THE

01:46:39.493 --> 01:46:41.228
POPULATION YOU KNOW IMPORTANT

01:46:41.294 --> 01:46:42.262
BUT NOT INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT

01:46:42.329 --> 01:46:46.166
AND. AND RELATIVE TO THESE

01:46:46.233 --> 01:46:46.700
OTHER FACTORS. NEXT SLIDE

01:46:46.767 --> 01:46:53.273
PLEASE. OKAY SO- YOU KNOW WHAT

01:46:53.340 --> 01:46:55.542
CAN WE DO WELL AND YOU KNOW WE

01:46:55.609 --> 01:46:57.844
NEED TO FOCUS ON- YOU KNOW WHAT

01:46:57.911 --> 01:47:00.347
WE NEED TO FOCUS ON- QUANTITY

01:47:00.413 --> 01:47:01.848
AND THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW

01:47:01.915 --> 01:47:03.917
WE CAN MOVE AWAY FROM WE CAN

01:47:03.984 --> 01:47:05.252
MOVE TOWARD A HIGH VALUE

01:47:05.318 --> 01:47:06.887
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IF YOU THINK

01:47:06.953 --> 01:47:08.388
ABOUT THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN

01:47:08.455 --> 01:47:10.490
A VERY SIMPLE WAY- AS I'VE

01:47:10.557 --> 01:47:11.792
DRAWN ON THE SLIDE RIGHT THERE

01:47:11.858 --> 01:47:13.994
ARE. THERE ARE PATIENTS AND

01:47:14.060 --> 01:47:15.896
PEOPLE THERE ARE PAIRS AS OUR

01:47:15.962 --> 01:47:17.330
ROUGHLY INSURERS ARE MEDICARE

01:47:17.397 --> 01:47:18.932
MEDICAID AL ON IN THEIR

01:47:18.999 --> 01:47:21.434
PROVIDERS WE REALLY HAVE THREE

01:47:21.501 --> 01:47:23.103
PLACES THAT WE CAN INTERVENE

01:47:23.170 --> 01:47:25.438
RIGHT WE CAN WE CAN THINK ABOUT

01:47:25.505 --> 01:47:28.175
HOW- THAT CONSUMERS ARE

01:47:28.241 --> 01:47:30.944
CHOOSING HEALTH PLANS RIGHT SO

01:47:31.011 --> 01:47:32.145
THAT'S IN THE UPPER LEFT HAND

01:47:32.212 --> 01:47:34.114
CORNER. WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT

01:47:34.181 --> 01:47:36.216
INCENTIVES FOR CHEETAH FOLKS TO

01:47:36.283 --> 01:47:38.451
CHOOSE HIGH VALUE COVERAGE WITH

01:47:38.518 --> 01:47:40.787
PREMIUMS SIGNALS WE CAN THINK

01:47:40.854 --> 01:47:43.623
ABOUT- HOW WE PAID PROVIDERS

01:47:43.690 --> 01:47:44.891
THAT'S THE RELIEF OVER THERE ON

01:47:44.958 --> 01:47:46.259
THE TOP RIGHT THAT'S THE

01:47:46.326 --> 01:47:48.094
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PAYERS AND

01:47:48.161 --> 01:47:49.663
PROVIDERS WE CAN INTERVENE

01:47:49.729 --> 01:47:51.264
THERE TO CREATE INCENTIVES TO

01:47:51.331 --> 01:47:52.933
DELIVER HIGH VALUE CARE AND

01:47:52.999 --> 01:47:53.667
THEN WE CAN THINK ABOUT THE

01:47:53.733 --> 01:47:55.101
BOTTOM WE CAN THINK ABOUT HOW

01:47:55.168 --> 01:47:56.069
PATIENTS INTERACT WITH THEIR

01:47:56.136 --> 01:47:57.671
HEALTH PLANS AND THINK ABOUT

01:47:57.737 --> 01:47:58.905
THE INCENTIVES THAT WE'RE

01:47:58.972 --> 01:48:01.074
GIVING TO PATIENTS TO USE HIGH

01:48:01.141 --> 01:48:02.742
VALUE SERVICES. OF COURSE

01:48:02.809 --> 01:48:03.844
PEOPLE WOULD WEIGH THESE

01:48:03.910 --> 01:48:04.744
DIFFERENT MECHANISMS THE

01:48:04.811 --> 01:48:06.012
IMPORTANCE OR THAT YOU KNOW

01:48:06.079 --> 01:48:06.947
EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE

01:48:07.013 --> 01:48:08.048
DIFFERENT YOU KNOW TYPES OF

01:48:08.114 --> 01:48:10.116
MECHANISMS DIFFERENTLY- BUT YOU

01:48:10.183 --> 01:48:13.653
KNOW THOSE ARE KIND OF THE

01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:14.221
CHOICES THAT WE HAVE ON THE

01:48:14.287 --> 01:48:18.825
TABLE. X. SLIDE PLEASE. OKAY SO

01:48:18.892 --> 01:48:21.394
IF I A N. ADDISON US SUMMARIZE

01:48:21.461 --> 01:48:23.430
I BASICALLY WANT TO REINFORCE

01:48:23.496 --> 01:48:25.365
THIS IDEA THAT I THINK YOU KNOW

01:48:25.432 --> 01:48:26.533
WE WANT TO SEE IS THAT IT'S NOT

01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:28.168
NECESSARILY THE COST PROBLEM

01:48:28.235 --> 01:48:29.703
BUT AS A VALUE PROBLEM AND

01:48:29.769 --> 01:48:32.472
AFFORDABILITY PROBLEM AND IF

01:48:32.539 --> 01:48:34.140
WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TOWARD

01:48:34.207 --> 01:48:37.143
VALUE WE HAVE TO DO YOU KNOW WE

01:48:37.210 --> 01:48:37.911
HAVE TO CHANGE THE INCENTIVES

01:48:37.978 --> 01:48:40.380
INTACT CENTER FACING INSURERS

01:48:40.447 --> 01:48:41.314
WOULD HAVE TO ADD THE SENTENCES

01:48:41.381 --> 01:48:43.350
FACING PROVIDERS AN INCENTIVE

01:48:43.416 --> 01:48:45.418
FACING CONSUMERS- IN A RISING

01:48:45.485 --> 01:48:47.220
MARKET CONCENTRATION I THINK IS

01:48:47.287 --> 01:48:49.122
A PROBLEM IN PRICES SENATE

01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:50.257
FOCUSED ON THAT. BUT I THINK

01:48:50.323 --> 01:48:52.058
IT'S ALSO A PROBLEM BECAUSE IT

01:48:52.125 --> 01:48:54.027
MAY IT CREATES A BARRIER PUTS A

01:48:54.094 --> 01:48:56.663
LOT OF POWER IN THE HANDS OF-

01:48:56.730 --> 01:48:58.565
OF PROVIDER ORGANIZATIONS AND

01:48:58.632 --> 01:49:02.602
EVEN INSURERS- TO THAT YOU KNOW

01:49:02.669 --> 01:49:03.870
TO PUSH BACK AGAINST THE TYPES

01:49:03.937 --> 01:49:05.972
OF CHANGES THAT WOULD MOVE US

01:49:06.039 --> 01:49:06.473
TOWARD A MORE HIGH VALUE

01:49:06.539 --> 01:49:08.708
SYSTEM- AND THEN OF COURSE WE

01:49:08.775 --> 01:49:10.911
NEED TO ADD SUBSIDIES TO MAKE

01:49:10.977 --> 01:49:12.679
HEALTH CARE AFFORDABLE BUT YOU

01:49:12.746 --> 01:49:13.580
KNOW WE HAVE TO ACTUALLY REALLY

01:49:13.647 --> 01:49:15.282
THINK ABOUT THE DESIGN OF

01:49:15.348 --> 01:49:18.585
SUBSIDIES- IN ORDER TO MAKE

01:49:18.652 --> 01:49:19.653
SURE THAT THE WAY WE'RE

01:49:19.719 --> 01:49:21.521
SUBSIDIZING CONSUMERS AND THE

01:49:21.588 --> 01:49:25.759
AREA. OF HEALTHCARE IS

01:49:25.825 --> 01:49:26.326
PROMOTING HIGH VALUE CARE.

PRESENTATION AND WITH A LOT OF

01:49:34.100 --> 01:49:34.601
REALLY VALUABLE INFORMATION

01:49:34.668 --> 01:49:35.235
LIKE TO SEE IF THERE MIGHT

01:49:35.302 --> 01:49:37.537
QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE I

01:49:37.604 --> 01:49:39.472
THINK WERE THEY WERE ABSORBING

01:49:39.539 --> 01:49:41.841
A LOT HERE SO. PLEASE

LITTLE OFF- A BECAUSE I

01:49:50.083 --> 01:49:51.851
REPRESENT RURAL AREAS AND I'M

01:49:51.918 --> 01:49:54.054
CONCERNED ABOUT ACOSTA KEEPS

ASKED AND. REGULATIONS FOR

01:50:02.262 --> 01:50:04.197
HOSPITALS ARE ESTIMATED BY RAN

01:50:04.264 --> 01:50:05.465
TO COST MORE THAN A HUNDRED

01:50:05.532 --> 01:50:07.233
BILLION DOLLARS. DO YOU BELIEVE

01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:08.501
THIS EXPENSE WOULD BE BORNE BY

01:50:08.568 --> 01:50:10.437
HEALTH CARE CONSUMERS AND WOULD

01:50:10.503 --> 01:50:12.272
THIS BE CONSIDERED AS A MAJOR

01:50:12.339 --> 01:50:21.081
HEALTH CARE COST DRIVER. PLEASE

ON YOU TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH

01:50:36.830 --> 01:50:38.531
PUBLIC SUBSIDIES ARE AVAILABLE

HOSTAGE YOU KNOW IT AND THE

01:50:46.873 --> 01:50:48.274
EXTENT TO WHICH HOSPITALS HAVE

01:50:48.341 --> 01:50:53.213
TO- ED GENERATE THE FUNDS FOR

01:50:53.279 --> 01:50:55.348
RETROFITTING US THROUGH THE

01:50:55.415 --> 01:50:56.916
SALE OF SERVICES TO CONSUMERS

01:50:56.983 --> 01:50:58.084
THAN IT DEFINITELY WILL RAISE

01:50:58.151 --> 01:51:02.522
PRICES SO DEPENDS ON YOU. AS IN

01:51:02.589 --> 01:51:03.123
MOST THINGS I THINK IT DEPENDS

01:51:03.189 --> 01:51:05.458
ON WHO PAYS. THANK YOU THANK

01:51:05.525 --> 01:51:06.659
YOU AND THAT THAT UMBER IS A

01:51:06.726 --> 01:51:07.894
HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR BILLION

01:51:07.961 --> 01:51:10.096
DOLLARS AS I RECALL THANK YOU

01:51:10.163 --> 01:51:11.898
SO IT'S A LARGE NUMBER. MISTER

01:51:11.965 --> 01:51:15.135
MASON. SO I REPRESENT AN AREA

01:51:15.201 --> 01:51:17.203
THAT'S- FAIRLY THE RULED BY

01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:18.638
ACTUALLY PART OF MY DISTRICT IS

01:51:18.705 --> 01:51:19.739
VERY REPEAT IT IS IT IS VERY

01:51:19.806 --> 01:51:22.609
RURAL- AND THERE IS OF ABOUT

01:51:22.675 --> 01:51:24.144
HALF OF MY DISTRICT POPULATION

01:51:24.210 --> 01:51:25.645
OF MY DISTRICT- THERE IS FOR

01:51:25.712 --> 01:51:28.581
HOSPITALS- AND THERE WAS TWO

01:51:28.648 --> 01:51:29.783
HOSPITALS THAT WERE. HAD

01:51:29.849 --> 01:51:31.317
CONTRACTED OUT WITH ONE

01:51:31.384 --> 01:51:33.319
PARTICULAR SYSTEM THE END OF

01:51:33.386 --> 01:51:35.321
THE RURAL COMMUNITY THAT I

01:51:35.388 --> 01:51:37.991
SERVE I HAD A PUBLIC HOSPITAL

01:51:38.058 --> 01:51:39.859
THEY JUST WEREN'T MAKING IT-

01:51:39.926 --> 01:51:41.528
AND- THE BOARD MADE THE

01:51:41.594 --> 01:51:44.264
DECISION A FEW YEARS AGO- TO.

01:51:44.330 --> 01:51:45.932
CALL YOU THE TERM CONSOLIDATE-

01:51:45.999 --> 01:51:48.902
WITH THAT THAT OTHER SYSTEM SO

01:51:48.968 --> 01:51:49.502
OF THE FOUR HOSPITALS THERE'S

01:51:49.569 --> 01:51:51.304
THREE. I'M HOSPITALS ARE NOW

01:51:51.371 --> 01:51:53.239
WITH THAT THAT THAT SYSTEM AND

01:51:53.306 --> 01:51:54.240
THE REASON WHY THE BOARD MADE

01:51:54.307 --> 01:51:55.675
THAT DECISION BECAUSE THERE'S A

01:51:55.742 --> 01:51:57.177
LACK OF PROVIDERS IN THOSE

01:51:57.243 --> 01:51:59.345
RURAL COMMUNITIES. AND THEY

01:51:59.412 --> 01:52:00.180
FOUND THAT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY

01:52:00.246 --> 01:52:01.481
GET BY HIGHER THAT THEY THOUGHT

01:52:01.548 --> 01:52:02.715
THEY WOULD GET HER HEALTH CARE

01:52:02.782 --> 01:52:05.185
MORE PROVIDERS OR ACCESS TO

01:52:05.251 --> 01:52:06.653
THOSE PROVIDERS. SO WE'RE

01:52:06.719 --> 01:52:07.754
TALKING ABOUT COST DRIVERS HOW

01:52:07.821 --> 01:52:09.856
DO YOU FACTOR THE AREAS THAT

01:52:09.923 --> 01:52:11.324
ARE RURAL VERSUS THOSE THAT ARE

01:52:11.391 --> 01:52:16.196
MORE SUBURBAN TO URBAN WHERE

01:52:16.262 --> 01:52:17.030
THEY'RE MOST MORE PROVIDERS. TO

01:52:17.097 --> 01:52:18.731
THAT QUESTION MAKE SENSE. THAT

01:52:18.798 --> 01:52:20.800
QUESTION. YEAH I MEAN I THINK

01:52:20.867 --> 01:52:22.001
THERE'S A LOT GOING ON THERE I

01:52:22.068 --> 01:52:24.337
THINK ISSUES OF RURAL HEALTH

01:52:24.404 --> 01:52:27.073
CARE AND HOSPITAL AND

01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:31.277
COMPETITION ARE YOU PROBABLY

01:52:31.344 --> 01:52:32.545
TRICKY AND SOME OF THE MORE

01:52:32.612 --> 01:52:34.314
TRICKY AREAS WE HAVE BECAUSE

01:52:34.380 --> 01:52:35.682
YOU KNOW IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE

01:52:35.748 --> 01:52:37.217
YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE LONG TERM

01:52:37.283 --> 01:52:39.085
TRENDS IN WHAT HOSPITALS DO

01:52:39.152 --> 01:52:40.820
HOSPITALS ARE REALLY MOVING

01:52:40.887 --> 01:52:43.022
THINGS TO OUTPATIENT CARE RATES

01:52:43.089 --> 01:52:44.891
SO- YOU KNOW MANY OF THE THINGS

01:52:44.958 --> 01:52:46.126
THAT WE STUDENT PATIENT YOU

01:52:46.192 --> 01:52:46.860
KNOW AND WE CAN NOW DO

01:52:46.926 --> 01:52:48.962
OUTPATIENT. SO IN SOME SENSE

01:52:49.028 --> 01:52:49.996
THAT'S GOOD YOU KNOW IN THE

01:52:50.063 --> 01:52:51.264
CONTEXT OF RURAL HEALTH CARE

01:52:51.331 --> 01:52:52.432
PROVIDERS BECAUSE MAYBE YOU

01:52:52.499 --> 01:52:53.700
KNOW THEY'RE LOWER FIXED COST

01:52:53.766 --> 01:52:55.001
TO ME WE CAN SUPPORT LARGER

01:52:55.068 --> 01:52:56.236
COMPETITION ARE MORE

01:52:56.302 --> 01:52:57.937
COMPETITION BUT IT DOES SUGGEST

01:52:58.004 --> 01:52:59.139
THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S A THERE'S

01:52:59.205 --> 01:53:01.174
A PROBLEM WITH COMPETITION- IN

01:53:01.241 --> 01:53:03.076
RURAL AREAS FOR ACUTE CARE

01:53:03.143 --> 01:53:04.444
SERVICES YOU KNOW SOME YOU KNOW

01:53:04.511 --> 01:53:06.112
WILL ALWAYS NEED WORK AT LEAST

01:53:06.179 --> 01:53:07.847
FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE WE

01:53:07.914 --> 01:53:08.948
WILL NEED SOME ACUTE CARE

01:53:09.015 --> 01:53:10.683
SERVICES AND YOU KNOW

01:53:10.750 --> 01:53:13.720
COMPETITION IT'S- IT'S TOUGH TO

01:53:13.786 --> 01:53:15.755
GENERATE ENOUGH SCALE AND

01:53:15.822 --> 01:53:17.390
HOSPITALS TO SUPPORT

01:53:17.457 --> 01:53:19.392
COMPETITION IN THESE AREAS SO.

01:53:19.459 --> 01:53:21.094
I MEAN I THINK THAT I WOULD SAY

01:53:21.161 --> 01:53:22.362
THAT I AM NOT AN EXPERT AND

01:53:22.428 --> 01:53:23.930
RURAL HEALTH BUT THAT DOES SEEM

01:53:23.997 --> 01:53:26.065
LIKE AN AREA IN WHICH- YOU KNOW

01:53:26.132 --> 01:53:27.734
POLICY COULD THINK ABOUT HOW

01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:31.971
TO- A SUPPORT HOSPITALS OR AT

01:53:32.038 --> 01:53:33.907
LEAST REGULATE HOSPITAL PRICES

01:53:33.973 --> 01:53:35.175
IN AREAS YOU KNOW ECONOMISTS

01:53:35.241 --> 01:53:36.075
WOULD CALL THAT A NATURAL

01:53:36.142 --> 01:53:37.210
MONOPOLY YOU KNOW IF THAT

01:53:37.277 --> 01:53:38.878
INDEED IS THE CASE WE MIGHT

01:53:38.945 --> 01:53:42.649
WANT TO THINK ABOUT. HOW TO

01:53:42.715 --> 01:53:43.116
TREAT THOSE HOSPITALS

01:53:43.183 --> 01:53:45.952
DIFFERENTLY. THANK I BELIEVE

01:53:46.019 --> 01:53:51.157

ONE IS ON THE- ON THE SLIDE

01:54:16.516 --> 01:54:18.218
THAT SAYS WHAT DRIVES GROWTH IN

01:54:18.284 --> 01:54:20.053
HEALTHCARE SPENDING. I'M

01:54:20.119 --> 01:54:22.689
LOOKING AT THE AGING POPULATION

01:54:22.755 --> 01:54:25.158
AT 2% IN TWO THOUSAND I'M JUST

01:54:25.225 --> 01:54:26.626
WONDERING WHAT WOULD THAT

01:54:26.693 --> 01:54:29.262
NUMBER BE IN TWENTY TWENTY

01:54:29.329 --> 01:54:30.129
GIVEN THAT IN THE LAST TWENTY

01:54:30.196 --> 01:54:35.068
YEARS. WE'VE ALSO SEEN. SEEN AS

01:54:35.134 --> 01:54:37.303
SPIKE IN A LOT OF THE-

01:54:37.370 --> 01:54:40.473
DEGENERATIVE DISEASE. DISEASES

01:54:40.540 --> 01:54:42.442
AND THE COST AND CONSUMPTION

01:54:42.508 --> 01:54:45.378
THAT THAT. TAKES A AND THE TOLD

01:54:45.445 --> 01:54:48.081
THAT IT'S TAKING SO- I'M

01:54:48.147 --> 01:54:49.682
WONDERING IF THAT WE WOULD SEE

01:54:49.749 --> 01:54:51.284
OF MORRIS AT THAT DIFFERENT

01:54:51.351 --> 01:54:53.386
PERCENTAGE AND A GREATER

01:54:53.453 --> 01:54:55.788
CONTRIBUTION OF COST. OKAY

01:54:55.855 --> 01:54:58.625
THAT'S ONE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU

01:54:58.691 --> 01:55:00.393
WANT TO ASK THAT FIRST OR WHAT

01:55:00.460 --> 01:55:01.461
ROUTE ME TO CAN YOU ABOUT

01:55:01.527 --> 01:55:02.428
HOUSTON'S LET'S PUT THEM ALL

01:55:02.495 --> 01:55:03.997
TOGETHER AND I'M I'M WRITING

01:55:04.063 --> 01:55:05.865
NOTES AND THEN. WE'LL A WE'LL

01:55:05.932 --> 01:55:08.301
GO FROM THERE IF I SCREWED UP

01:55:08.368 --> 01:55:13.039
OKAY NAMA. TEXT TEXT ME. OKAY

01:55:13.106 --> 01:55:14.540
AND THEN AND THEN THE SECOND

01:55:14.607 --> 01:55:16.309
ONE IS ON THE TWO TWO SLIDES

01:55:16.376 --> 01:55:18.745
LATER- DISTRIBUTION OF NATIONAL

01:55:18.811 --> 01:55:23.483
HEALTH EXPENDITURES. WHERE

01:55:23.549 --> 01:55:26.486
WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE COST

01:55:26.552 --> 01:55:31.691
SHARE CHANGING SINCE NINETEEN

01:55:31.758 --> 01:55:32.292
SIXTY TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

01:55:32.358 --> 01:55:34.827
BETWEEN. THE OUT OF POCKET

01:55:34.894 --> 01:55:36.629
COSTS PUBLIC INSURANCE PRIVATE

01:55:36.696 --> 01:55:38.531
INSURANCE AND OTHER. WHAT I'M

01:55:38.598 --> 01:55:39.899
INTERESTED TO KNOW IS HOW DOES

01:55:39.966 --> 01:55:42.468
THIS COMPARE. TO OTHER ADVANCED

01:55:42.535 --> 01:55:46.739
COUNTRIES. GREAT QUESTION GREAT

01:55:46.806 --> 01:55:49.442
QUESTION OKAY SO I WILL. GO

01:55:49.509 --> 01:55:52.745
AHEAD AND- WHAT ONE LAST WELL

01:55:52.812 --> 01:55:55.281
AND THEN ONE LAST ONE ANY COULD

01:55:55.348 --> 01:55:58.251
BE EITHER ON THIS- THIS SLIDE

01:55:58.318 --> 01:56:00.586
FOR THE NEXT SLIDE BUT WHICH

01:56:00.653 --> 01:56:02.055
WHICH HAS TO DO WITH THE OUT OF

01:56:02.121 --> 01:56:04.090
POCKET COSTS WHERE SHOULD THE

01:56:04.157 --> 01:56:07.060
OUT OF POCKET COST B. MA'AM I'M

01:56:07.126 --> 01:56:08.127
A BELIEVER THAT THERE SHOULD

01:56:08.194 --> 01:56:11.464
BE. A SMALL COST BORN ON THE

01:56:11.531 --> 01:56:17.236
INDIVIDUAL. BECAUSE THAT ALSO

01:56:17.303 --> 01:56:18.438
KEEPS IN CHECK AND

01:56:18.504 --> 01:56:19.872
ACCOUNTABILITY THAT THAT

01:56:19.939 --> 01:56:21.507
INDIVIDUALS DON'T TAKE

01:56:21.574 --> 01:56:24.344
ADVANTAGE OF THE SYSTEM SO

01:56:24.410 --> 01:56:25.978
THERE SHOULD BE A SMALL COST

01:56:26.045 --> 01:56:27.347
BUT OVER HERE IT SAYS BASICALLY

01:56:27.413 --> 01:56:31.150
IT'S AROUND. 10% RIGHT WHERE

01:56:31.217 --> 01:56:31.818
SHOULD IT ACTUALLY HE WHERE

01:56:31.884 --> 01:56:33.386
IT'S BEEN THE SUCCESS THAT

01:56:33.453 --> 01:56:34.921
WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER COUNTRIES

01:56:34.987 --> 01:56:37.156
THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE

01:56:37.223 --> 01:56:39.625
THAT. GREAT KEEP SUCCESS OKAY

01:56:39.692 --> 01:56:41.427
THANKS THANK YOU THANK YOU SO

01:56:41.494 --> 01:56:44.864
OKAY SPRING DR BEND OR BACK AND

01:56:44.931 --> 01:56:45.465
I'M GONNA DO MY BEST ON THESE

01:56:45.531 --> 01:56:47.867
QUESTIONS. OKAY SO WE'VE GOT

01:56:47.934 --> 01:56:49.836
THREE QUESTIONS FOR YOU. THE

01:56:49.902 --> 01:56:52.472
FIRST ONE IS- YOUR SLIDE THE

01:56:52.538 --> 01:56:54.073
SAYS WHAT DRIVES GROWTH IN

01:56:54.140 --> 01:56:56.609
HEALTHCARE SPENDING. AND WE'VE

01:56:56.676 --> 01:56:59.912
GOT- AGING OF THE POPULATION

01:56:59.979 --> 01:57:04.650
YOU GO FROM. NINETY TWO TO

01:57:04.717 --> 01:57:05.184
NINETY FIVE TO TWENTY TWO

01:57:05.251 --> 01:57:06.552
THOUSAND AND IT'S LIKE 2% EACH

01:57:06.619 --> 01:57:08.921
OF THOSE. WHERE YOU KNOW WHERE

01:57:08.988 --> 01:57:10.990
DO YOU SEE WHAT CAN YOU GIVE US

01:57:11.057 --> 01:57:12.692
AN IDEA WHERE YOU SEE THAT.

01:57:12.759 --> 01:57:16.095
NUMBER MIGHT BE IN TWENTY

01:57:16.162 --> 01:57:16.729
TWENTY TWENTY YEARS IS A LONG

01:57:16.796 --> 01:57:17.830
TIME AND WE HAVE AN AGING

01:57:17.897 --> 01:57:20.466
POPULATION SO DO YOU DO YOU SEE

01:57:20.533 --> 01:57:22.335
WHERE WHERE WOULD YOU SEE THAT

01:57:22.402 --> 01:57:24.270
PROJECT IN AN OBVIOUSLY WELL

01:57:24.337 --> 01:57:25.638
WE'RE NOT GONNA HOLD YOU TO IT.

01:57:25.705 --> 01:57:28.574
BUT BUT YOU KNOW GIVE US YOUR

01:57:28.641 --> 01:57:34.680
BEST SHOT AT IT. YEAH OKAY

01:57:34.747 --> 01:57:35.948
THANK YOU FOR NOT HOLDING ME TO

01:57:36.015 --> 01:57:37.984
THAT. BUT I DO HAVE I DO HAVE A

01:57:38.050 --> 01:57:39.719
SLIDE RIGHT SO I FEEL CONFIDENT

01:57:39.786 --> 01:57:42.922
THREE. REJECTION SO ONE OF THE

01:57:42.989 --> 01:57:45.892
SLIDES TOWARDS THE END- THERE

01:57:45.958 --> 01:57:47.627
WERE UPDATED NUMBERS I THINK

01:57:47.693 --> 01:57:49.228
THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN KIND

01:57:49.295 --> 01:57:50.430
OF YOU KNOW IS THAT SLIDE IN

01:57:50.496 --> 01:57:52.498
THE END WHERE WE DECOMPOSED-

01:57:52.565 --> 01:57:56.035
RIGHT AND COST GROWTH INTO. A

01:57:56.102 --> 01:57:58.771
PRICE QUANTITY AND AGING OF THE

01:57:58.838 --> 01:58:01.941
POPULATION. RATIO AND YOU KNOW

01:58:02.008 --> 01:58:04.811
I ACTUALLY CAN'T SEE MY SLIDES-

01:58:04.877 --> 01:58:06.345
SO I THINK IT WAS A VERY SMALL

01:58:06.412 --> 01:58:07.880
BAR YES THE ROLE KNOWN

01:58:07.947 --> 01:58:10.950
LICENSING. THANK YOU THIRTY

01:58:11.017 --> 01:58:12.318
GOOD AT. HELPING YOU WITH THAT

01:58:12.385 --> 01:58:13.986
NUMBER. YEAH THERE WE GO

01:58:14.053 --> 01:58:16.622
PERFECT THAT'S AWESOME YEAH SO

01:58:16.689 --> 01:58:17.590
I CAN SEE THE RED BAR BUT I

01:58:17.657 --> 01:58:18.691
CAN'T SEE THE POINT IS THAT

01:58:18.758 --> 01:58:22.361
LIKE LAKE. LAKE FIVE INCH FOUR

01:58:22.428 --> 01:58:24.263
INCH 66% DOWN THEIR- WAY OVER

01:58:24.330 --> 01:58:25.665
ON THE RIGHT. YEAH IT'S

01:58:25.731 --> 01:58:27.133
ACTUALLY YEAH IT'S ACTUALLY

01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:28.468
EVEN SMALLER THAN THAT BUT I

01:58:28.534 --> 01:58:30.269
THINK THAT THE IMPORTANT TREND

01:58:30.336 --> 01:58:31.070
THERE IS THAT IT SEEMS TO BE

01:58:31.137 --> 01:58:34.674
FAIRLY STABLE. THAT IS ISN'T IN

01:58:34.740 --> 01:58:35.374
OTHER WORDS THAT YES YOU KNOW

01:58:35.441 --> 01:58:37.176
IT'S SO AT THE ABSOLUTELY SO

01:58:37.243 --> 01:58:39.278
THAT WAS MY NEXT AT POINTS

01:58:39.345 --> 01:58:41.280
THAT'S THE TWO THOUSAND

01:58:41.347 --> 01:58:42.381
EIGHTEEN AND THEN YOU KNOW YOU

01:58:42.448 --> 01:58:43.983
KNOW DEBTS. AS YOU SAID IT'S

01:58:44.050 --> 01:58:45.585
BEEN PRETTY STABLE SO IT'S NT

01:58:45.651 --> 01:58:47.253
A HUGE LEAP OF FAITH TO THINK

01:58:47.320 --> 01:58:48.254
THAT IT WILL BE SIMILAR IN

01:58:48.321 --> 01:58:50.323
TWENTY TWENTY. OKAY THAT BEING

01:58:50.389 --> 01:58:52.525
SAID- I WANT TO MAKE TWO

01:58:52.592 --> 01:58:54.727
QUALIFICATIONS TO THAT SO. IF

01:58:54.794 --> 01:58:57.763
YOU GO AND YOU KNOW AND MAYBE I

01:58:57.830 --> 01:58:59.465
CAN SEND SOME OF THE STATE THAT

01:58:59.532 --> 01:59:01.067
AFTERWARDS AND YOU LOOK AT THE

01:59:01.133 --> 01:59:05.304
EXPENDITURES. FOR MEDICARE-

01:59:05.371 --> 01:59:07.406
DONE BY THE AND MEDICARE

01:59:07.473 --> 01:59:10.243
ACTUARIES. THEY FORECAST THAT

01:59:10.309 --> 01:59:13.012
FOR MEDICARE THIS THIS SHARE IS

01:59:13.079 --> 01:59:14.881
INCREASING RIGHT IT'S- YOU KNOW

01:59:14.947 --> 01:59:17.216
IT'S A YOU KNOW IT USED TO

01:59:17.283 --> 01:59:20.219
EXPLAIN YOU KNOW SO MAYBE 5210%

01:59:20.286 --> 01:59:22.088
OF MEDICARE AND MAYBE IT'S

01:59:22.154 --> 01:59:23.723
GOING UP TO FIFTEEN THOSE ARE.

01:59:23.789 --> 01:59:24.824
THOSE ARE BALLPARK NUMBERS

01:59:24.891 --> 01:59:25.758
THERE THAT'S WHERE I'M GONNA

01:59:25.825 --> 01:59:27.193
TAKE YOU UP ON YOUR OFFER OF

01:59:27.260 --> 01:59:33.399
YOU KNOW NOT. AN EXACT ESTIMATE

01:59:33.466 --> 01:59:34.133
THAT WILL SURELY A. B. AND

01:59:34.200 --> 01:59:34.934
COULD. AS WE GO FOR. BECAUSE

01:59:35.001 --> 01:59:36.569
THE- IS GOING TO AGE RAPIDLY

01:59:36.636 --> 01:59:38.638
THAN IT DID IN THE PAST. OKAY

01:59:38.704 --> 01:59:40.072
SO THAT'S ONE THING I WANNA SAY

01:59:40.139 --> 01:59:41.173
THE OTHER THING I THINK YOU

01:59:41.240 --> 01:59:42.875
MENTIONED NEUROSURGEON DIGITAL

01:59:42.942 --> 01:59:44.610
DEGENERATIVE DISEASES. THE

01:59:44.677 --> 01:59:45.511
OTHER THING IS A LITTLE TRICKY

01:59:45.578 --> 01:59:47.613
ABOUT THIS IS THAT. THE

01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:50.483
COMPOSITION OF THE POPULATION.

01:59:50.550 --> 01:59:51.984
WILL DRIVE WHAT TYPES OF

01:59:52.051 --> 01:59:54.987
TECHNOLOGIES ARE DEVELOPED IN

01:59:55.054 --> 01:59:57.557
THE FUTURE RIGHT SO YOU KNOW WE

01:59:57.623 --> 01:59:58.157
HAVE A LOT OF LITTLE

01:59:58.224 --> 01:59:59.358
ENTREPRENEURS AND BIG

01:59:59.425 --> 02:00:00.793
ENTREPRENEURS OUT THERE AND

02:00:00.860 --> 02:00:01.961
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND THEY'RE

02:00:02.028 --> 02:00:03.529
LOOKING AT THE POPULATION AGING

02:00:03.596 --> 02:00:06.632
AS WELL. SO YOU KNOW PEOPLE

02:00:06.699 --> 02:00:08.434
WILL BE INVESTING THEIR MONEY

02:00:08.501 --> 02:00:11.237
AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO TREAT

02:00:11.304 --> 02:00:14.907
OUR AGING POPULATION- AND THAT

02:00:14.974 --> 02:00:17.510
IS NOT OFTEN NOT DIRECTLY

02:00:17.577 --> 02:00:20.012
ACCOUNTED FOR IN THESE NUMBERS

02:00:20.079 --> 02:00:22.315
RIGHT SO- SO WE CAN THINK THAT

02:00:22.381 --> 02:00:23.849
MAYBE THAT THE AND THAT AND I

02:00:23.916 --> 02:00:24.884
GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING OR WHAT I

02:00:24.951 --> 02:00:26.052
AM SAYING. IS THAT THERE'S AN

02:00:26.118 --> 02:00:27.420
INTERACTION BETWEEN THE AGING

02:00:27.486 --> 02:00:28.821
OF POPULATION THE DEVELOPMENT

02:00:28.888 --> 02:00:30.923
OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. THAT WE

02:00:30.990 --> 02:00:32.758
HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND AND MAYBE

02:00:32.825 --> 02:00:34.126
THE AGING OF THE POPULATION

02:00:34.193 --> 02:00:35.661
WILL EITHER BE MORE IMPORTANT

02:00:35.728 --> 02:00:36.996
IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE OF THE

02:00:37.063 --> 02:00:38.598
INTERACTION. THE OTHER THING I

02:00:38.664 --> 02:00:39.565
WANT TO SAY THAT I ACTUALLY

02:00:39.632 --> 02:00:41.367
FORGOT TO SAY N. M. WHAT I WAS

02:00:41.434 --> 02:00:42.902
TALKING ABOUT THOSE STUDIES

02:00:42.969 --> 02:00:46.038
AND- A DAD YOU KNOW. A PULLED

02:00:46.105 --> 02:00:48.107
APART THE SOURCES OF HEALTH

02:00:48.174 --> 02:00:49.308
CARE COSTS GROWTH USING THE

02:00:49.375 --> 02:00:51.877
HISTORICAL DATA. IS INTO IT AS

02:00:51.944 --> 02:00:53.179
JUST AS THERE IS AN INTERACTION

02:00:53.245 --> 02:00:54.614
BETWEEN AGING OF THE POPULATION

02:00:54.680 --> 02:00:55.348
IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW

02:00:55.414 --> 02:00:56.782
TECHNOLOGY. THERE ISN'T

02:00:56.849 --> 02:00:58.284
INTERACTION BETWEEN INSURANCE

02:00:58.351 --> 02:00:59.518
COVERAGE AND THE DEVELOP OF NEW

02:00:59.585 --> 02:01:01.153
TECHNOLOGY SO ENTREPRENEURS OUT

02:01:01.220 --> 02:01:02.588
THERE SAYING OKAY SO. YOU KNOW

02:01:02.655 --> 02:01:04.624
WHEN MEDICARE AND EXPANDED

02:01:04.690 --> 02:01:06.492
HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR

02:01:06.559 --> 02:01:10.162
PHARMACEUTICALS TO AND- OLDER

02:01:10.229 --> 02:01:12.398
ADULTS WE SAW. A YOU KNOW A

02:01:12.465 --> 02:01:15.234
BURST OF. INNOVATION FOR DRUGS

02:01:15.301 --> 02:01:17.203
USED TO TREAT THE CONDITIONS

02:01:17.269 --> 02:01:19.271
THAT PRIMARILY ARE YEAH YOU

02:01:19.338 --> 02:01:20.673
KNOW RELEVANT FOR THESE OLDER

02:01:20.740 --> 02:01:22.608
ADULTS SO THE- INTERACT AND

02:01:22.675 --> 02:01:23.809
WHEN WE THINK OF LONG TERM

02:01:23.876 --> 02:01:25.578
COSTS GROWTH THE INTERACTION OF

02:01:25.645 --> 02:01:28.080
INSURANCE AND TECHNOLOGY IS

02:01:28.147 --> 02:01:32.785
ALSO IMPORTANT. AND SO THAT WAS

02:01:32.852 --> 02:01:35.287
THE FIRST. OKAY THREE YEAH

02:01:35.354 --> 02:01:36.255
THING THAT I COULD HEAR FUMBLE

02:01:36.322 --> 02:01:37.957
OF THEM. YEAH THE SECOND IS

02:01:38.024 --> 02:01:39.025
SHOULD I GO AHEAD AND ANSWERED

02:01:39.091 --> 02:01:40.126
YEAH THAT'S REGARDING THE

02:01:40.192 --> 02:01:42.395
DISTRIBUTION OF NATIONAL HEALTH

02:01:42.461 --> 02:01:45.131
EXPENDITURES. SPECIFICALLY

02:01:45.197 --> 02:01:46.866
RELATED TO OUT OF POCKET

02:01:46.932 --> 02:01:48.067
EXPENSE. AND HOW DOES THAT

02:01:48.134 --> 02:01:51.604
COMPARE TO WHAT WE SEE IN OTHER

02:01:51.671 --> 02:01:56.475
ADVANCED COUNTRIES. SO ARE NOT

02:01:56.542 --> 02:02:01.047
SO IT. YEAH GO AHEAD I'M SORRY.

02:02:01.113 --> 02:02:02.348
YEP YEP SO THAT'S THAT'S A

02:02:02.415 --> 02:02:04.016
GREAT QUESTION IT VARIES I

02:02:04.083 --> 02:02:05.751
WOULD SAY THAT WE TEND TO BE ON

02:02:05.818 --> 02:02:07.887
THE HIGHER SIDE OF OUT OF

02:02:07.953 --> 02:02:09.255
POCKET PAYMENTS THAN OTHER

02:02:09.321 --> 02:02:11.390
COUNTRIES OTHER THAT'S THAT'S

02:02:11.457 --> 02:02:13.526
NOT UNIVERSALLY TRUE GREAT SO

02:02:13.592 --> 02:02:15.961
BUT WE TEND TO BE ON THE HIGHER

02:02:16.028 --> 02:02:17.830
SIDE. WE HAVE HAD A- I WOULD

02:02:17.897 --> 02:02:20.032
SAY A BIGGER CHANGE OVER THAT

02:02:20.099 --> 02:02:22.301
LAST LONG TIME PERIOD RIGHT AS

02:02:22.368 --> 02:02:23.836
WE YOU KNOW A IN OTHER

02:02:23.903 --> 02:02:25.905
COUNTRIES EXTENDED. INSURANCE

02:02:25.971 --> 02:02:28.007
COVERAGE YOU KNOW PARTICULARLY

02:02:28.074 --> 02:02:29.241
YOU KNOW IN THE EIGHTIES AND

02:02:29.308 --> 02:02:31.077
WHATNOT EARLY TO A BROADER SET

02:02:31.143 --> 02:02:32.344
OF THE POPULATION EARLIER THAN

02:02:32.411 --> 02:02:34.246
WE DID RIGHT SO. MAYBE THE

02:02:34.313 --> 02:02:35.915
CHANGE HAS NOT BEEN AS DRAMATIC

02:02:35.981 --> 02:02:36.949
AND I THINK OUR LEVELS ARE A

02:02:37.016 --> 02:02:39.151
BIT HIGHER. ON IN PART BECAUSE

02:02:39.218 --> 02:02:40.419
JUST OUR EXPENDITURES ARE

02:02:40.486 --> 02:02:41.887
HIGHER SO IT'S A DIFFERENT THAT

02:02:41.954 --> 02:02:43.155
THIS THE DIFFERENCE IS MORE

02:02:43.222 --> 02:02:44.623
STRIKING IF YOU LOOK AT LEVELS

02:02:44.690 --> 02:02:46.325
OF HEALTHCARE SPENDING. THAT IF

02:02:46.392 --> 02:02:47.827
YOU LOOK AT THE PROPORTION OF

02:02:47.893 --> 02:02:49.795
HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURES FUNDED

02:02:49.862 --> 02:02:52.364
OUT OF POCKET. I'M RELATED TO

02:02:52.431 --> 02:02:53.532
THE I THINK IT WAS THE NEXT

02:02:53.599 --> 02:02:55.101
PART OF THAT QUESTION- YOU KNOW

02:02:55.167 --> 02:02:56.736
ONE POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS.

02:02:56.802 --> 02:02:58.337
OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE COUNTRY

02:02:58.404 --> 02:02:59.772
TO HAVE LOWER HEALTH CARE

02:02:59.839 --> 02:03:02.208
EXPENDITURES RELIED LESS. ON

02:03:02.274 --> 02:03:03.609
OUT OF POCKET EXPENDITURES

02:03:03.676 --> 02:03:05.478
DRESS ADDRESSED A DIRECTED

02:03:05.544 --> 02:03:07.680
WORKING TOWARD CONSUMERS. TO

02:03:07.747 --> 02:03:10.049
CONTROL HEALTH CARE COSTS RIGHT

02:03:10.116 --> 02:03:11.083
BUT THEY RELY AND OTHER

02:03:11.150 --> 02:03:12.118
MECHANISMS RIGHT THEY HAVE

02:03:12.184 --> 02:03:13.953
TIGHTER CONTROLS AT THE CENTRAL

02:03:14.019 --> 02:03:16.522
LEVEL. OR YOU KNOW THEY MAY BE-

02:03:16.589 --> 02:03:17.923
YOU KNOW HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF

02:03:17.990 --> 02:03:19.492
PRICING PHARMACEUTICALS AND

02:03:19.558 --> 02:03:21.093
MOVING PEOPLE TOWARD YOU KNOW

02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:23.229
LET YOU KNOW THAT MOVING. AT

02:03:23.295 --> 02:03:24.396
PEOPLE TOWARD LOWER COST

02:03:24.463 --> 02:03:26.932
PHARMACEUTICALS. SO IT'S- IT'S

02:03:26.999 --> 02:03:29.502
AN E. DIFFERENT COUNTRIES EVEN

02:03:29.568 --> 02:03:30.870
ROUGHLY THINKING ABOUT LAST

02:03:30.936 --> 02:03:32.138
NIGHT THAT I HAD OF YOU KNOW

02:03:32.204 --> 02:03:33.739
THEY'RE BASICALLY THREE PLACES

02:03:33.806 --> 02:03:34.907
TO INTERVENE RIGHT YOU KNOW THE

02:03:34.974 --> 02:03:36.408
WAY PAY PROVIDERS THE WAY

02:03:36.475 --> 02:03:38.677
CONSUMERS CHOOSE PLANS AND COST

02:03:38.744 --> 02:03:42.815
SHARING ANOTHER- INTERVENTIONS

02:03:42.882 --> 02:03:43.282
TARGETED AT CONSUMERS.

02:03:43.349 --> 02:03:43.849
DIFFERENT YOU CAN THINK OF

02:03:43.916 --> 02:03:44.917
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES CHOOSING

02:03:44.984 --> 02:03:46.318
DIFFERENT BASKETS OF THOSE

02:03:46.385 --> 02:03:47.987
THINGS RIGHT SOVIET LOW COST.

02:03:48.053 --> 02:03:51.557
GOT TO DO SOMETHING ELSE. GRAY

02:03:51.624 --> 02:03:52.458
AND I THINK I THINK YOU OF

02:03:52.525 --> 02:03:54.226
THEIR YOU WE THE THIRD QUEST

02:03:54.293 --> 02:03:55.928
WAS REALLY WHERE IDEALLY SHOULD

02:03:55.995 --> 02:03:57.930
THAT BE BUT I THINK. IT THAT

02:03:57.997 --> 02:03:59.298
THAT'S REALLY KIND OF A MOOT

02:03:59.365 --> 02:04:01.200
POINT BECAUSE THE SYSTEMS ARE

02:04:01.267 --> 02:04:03.169
ARE ARE DIFFERENT AND- IN

02:04:03.235 --> 02:04:04.236
COUNTRIES LIKE YOU SAID THAT

02:04:04.303 --> 02:04:08.841
HAVE LOWER. LOWER COST FOR CARE

02:04:08.908 --> 02:04:10.176
THE OUT OF POCKET IS LOWER

02:04:10.242 --> 02:04:11.911
BECAUSE THERE OF OTHER

02:04:11.977 --> 02:04:15.014
CENTRALIZED CONTROL SO- SO I

02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:16.749
KNOW MISTER NAZARIAN SAID HE HE

02:04:16.816 --> 02:04:17.817
HE WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW UP WITH

02:04:17.883 --> 02:04:20.152
YOU- AT A LATER DATE ON THIS

02:04:20.219 --> 02:04:20.719
AND SO WE'LL FIND A WAY TO

02:04:20.786 --> 02:04:22.288
CONNECT THE TWO OF YOU. MISTER

02:04:22.354 --> 02:04:23.656
NAZARIAN JUST SO YOU KNOW IS

02:04:23.722 --> 02:04:25.124

TO OUR TO OUR AGING POPULATION

02:04:32.431 --> 02:04:35.267

THAT'S BEEN IN TRANSITION-

02:06:55.007 --> 02:06:56.542
RIGHT NOW THERE'S EIGHTEEN

02:06:56.608 --> 02:06:58.610

THAT- THERE'S BEEN TREMENDOUS

02:07:08.454 --> 02:07:10.422
INTEREST AROUND THE COUNTRY AND

02:07:33.812 --> 02:07:36.015
CLAIMS DATABASES HAVE A LOT O

02:07:36.081 --> 02:07:37.583
ADVANTAGES OVER THE CURRENT

02:07:37.649 --> 02:07:40.486
DATA SAID THAT- PEOPLE LIKE MY

02:07:40.552 --> 02:07:41.820
COLLEAGUES WHO SPOKE BEFORE

02:07:41.887 --> 02:07:44.790
HAVE BEEN TRYING TO LEVERAGE

02:07:44.857 --> 02:07:45.924
FOR YEARS BOB HAVE BEEN DOING

02:07:45.991 --> 02:07:47.893
IMPORTANT WORK TO TRY TO

02:07:47.960 --> 02:07:49.094
DESCRIBE THE HEALTH CARE MARKET

02:07:49.161 --> 02:07:51.764
PLACE- AND SOME OF ITS SHORT

02:07:51.830 --> 02:07:54.867
COMINGS- BUT THE REAL ADVANTAGE

02:07:54.933 --> 02:07:57.836
OF THESE DATASETS ARE THAT- YOU

02:07:57.903 --> 02:08:00.773
ARE ABLE TO PULL TOGETHER DATA

02:08:00.839 --> 02:08:01.640
FROM ALL THESE DIFFERENT

02:08:01.707 --> 02:08:04.376
SOURCES TO DESCRIBE A COMPLETE

02:08:04.443 --> 02:08:06.578
PICTURE OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN

02:08:06.645 --> 02:08:07.146
THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE

02:08:07.212 --> 02:08:11.483
MARKET PLACE- MANY STUDIES-

02:08:11.550 --> 02:08:13.619
THAT HAVE EXISTED TO DATE HAVE

02:08:13.685 --> 02:08:14.953
LOOKED AT SEGMENTS OF THE

02:08:15.020 --> 02:08:17.056
MARKET SO MAY LOOK JUST AT THE

02:08:17.122 --> 02:08:19.358
MEDICAID PORTION OR MEDICARE-

02:08:19.425 --> 02:08:21.727
AND- I THINK AS WE ALL KNOW

02:08:21.794 --> 02:08:24.163
THESE DIFFERENT INSURANCE

02:08:24.229 --> 02:08:25.764

02:08:25.831 --> 02:08:30.936
STRUCTURES. AND SORT OF HOW THE

02:08:31.003 --> 02:08:32.604
OUTCOMES THAT ARE DELIVERED

02:08:32.671 --> 02:08:35.774
FROM THOSE PROGRAMS VERY- AND-

02:08:35.841 --> 02:08:37.543
WE KNOW THAT PROVIDERS BEHAVIOR

02:08:37.609 --> 02:08:39.445
VARIES BASED ON SORT OF THE

02:08:39.511 --> 02:08:42.648
STRUCTURE OF A SET OF-

02:08:42.714 --> 02:08:44.383
INCENTIVES THAT ARE BUILT INTO

THE IT'S- INSURANCE- PACKAGES

02:08:47.820 --> 02:08:51.056
IF YOU WELL AND- SO ONE OF THE

02:08:51.123 --> 02:08:52.391
THINGS THAT ALL PAYER CLAIMS

02:09:13.812 --> 02:09:16.315
THAT I THINK- WHEN WE'VE SORT

02:09:16.381 --> 02:09:18.417

SHORTCOMINGS ARE YOU END UP

02:09:24.223 --> 02:09:26.758
WITH VERY SMALL SAMPLE SIZES

02:09:26.825 --> 02:09:29.027
AND- IT'S HARD TO GET WHAT I

02:09:29.094 --> 02:09:30.829
CALL RELIABLE ESTIMATES ON

02:09:30.896 --> 02:09:34.500

02:09:34.566 --> 02:09:35.701
THAT'S QUALITY PER BERMAN. ON

02:09:35.767 --> 02:09:37.736
THE EXISTING OF DISK AND HEALTH

02:09:37.803 --> 02:09:41.907

OF THE DELIVERY OF THAT CARE-

02:09:44.443 --> 02:09:45.644
SO PULLING THAT INFORMATION

02:09:45.711 --> 02:09:47.246
TOGETHER GIVE SHOUP'S OF

02:09:47.312 --> 02:09:48.347

SLIDE- I THINK EVERYBODY HERE

02:09:58.991 --> 02:10:00.292

THE FOREFRONT OF BUILDING THE

02:10:13.105 --> 02:10:14.573
LARGEST ALL PAYER CLAIMS

IS REALLY EXCITING- THE AND I

02:10:19.611 --> 02:10:20.979
KNOW NOT ONLY THE RESEARCHERS

02:10:21.046 --> 02:10:22.748

02:10:22.814 --> 02:10:25.117
NATIONALLY ARE LOOKING FORWARD.

02:10:25.184 --> 02:10:27.085
TO TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

02:10:27.152 --> 02:10:30.822
EXPLORING THESE DATA AND-

02:10:30.889 --> 02:10:32.558
HELPING TO BUILD EVIDENCE-

02:10:32.624 --> 02:10:35.260
AROUND- SAVE- DIFFERENT TYPES

02:10:35.327 --> 02:10:36.595
OF PAYMENT MODELS THAT ARE MARK

02:10:36.662 --> 02:10:39.198
SUCCESSFUL- AS WELL AS TRYING

02:10:39.264 --> 02:10:41.333
TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT HAPPENS

02:10:41.400 --> 02:10:42.901
WHEN A DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS

02:10:42.968 --> 02:10:45.437
IMPLEMENT CERTAIN POLICIES-

02:10:45.504 --> 02:10:46.705
WHETHER IT'S AROUND COST

THOSE TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS

02:10:52.511 --> 02:10:57.482
ARE EFFECTIVE. SO ASSEMBLY BILL

02:10:57.549 --> 02:10:59.551
EIGHTEEN TEN- ALLOWED ALL SHE

02:10:59.618 --> 02:11:00.752

COMMITTEE A FULL DISCLOSURE I

02:11:02.521 --> 02:11:05.290
WAS ON THAT COMMITTEE- AND THIS

02:11:05.357 --> 02:11:06.258
WAS A MULTI STATE GOVERNMENT

02:11:06.325 --> 02:11:07.626
STAKEHOLDER GROUP THAT CAME

02:11:07.693 --> 02:11:10.429
TOGETHER. TO HELP ADVISE OFSHE

02:11:12.030 --> 02:11:13.765
AROUND THE ESTABLISHMENT-

02:11:13.832 --> 02:11:15.367
IMPLEMENTATION AND

02:11:15.434 --> 02:11:16.034
ADMINISTRATION OF THIS

02:11:16.101 --> 02:11:19.271
DATABASE. I SUBSEQUENTLY- A. B.

02:11:19.338 --> 02:11:22.541
EIGHTY- NOW IT HAS PROVIDED

02:11:22.608 --> 02:11:24.209
OFSHE FITTED WITH THE AUTHORITY

02:11:24.276 --> 02:11:25.611

02:11:25.677 --> 02:11:27.479
PAYMENT DATABASE HERE IN

02:11:27.546 --> 02:11:30.115
CALIFORNIA. AND I WHAT I WANT

02:11:30.182 --> 02:11:31.650
TO LEAVE THE COMMITTEE WITH IS

02:11:31.717 --> 02:11:33.885
THIS A P. C. D. IT'S GOING TO

02:11:33.952 --> 02:11:36.121
BE A VITAL RESOURCE TO SUPPORT

02:11:36.188 --> 02:11:38.323
THE EFFORTS OF CALIFORNIA TO

02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:39.591
TRY TO IMPROVE THE

02:11:39.658 --> 02:11:42.094
AFFORDABILITY ISSUE- THAT SOME

02:11:42.160 --> 02:11:44.263
OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS HAVE.

02:11:44.329 --> 02:11:47.199
SPOKEN TO. AND IF WE MOVE TO

02:11:47.266 --> 02:11:49.768
THE NEXT SLIDE SO THIS IS

02:11:49.835 --> 02:11:51.003
REALLY WHERE THE RUBBER MEETS

02:11:51.069 --> 02:11:52.571
THE ROAD ABOUT WHY ARE WE

02:11:52.638 --> 02:11:54.873
MAKING THIS HUGE INVESTMENTS-

02:11:54.940 --> 02:11:58.010
IN DATA SYSTEMS- AND PULLING

02:11:58.076 --> 02:11:59.411
ALL THIS INFORMATION TOGETHER

02:11:59.478 --> 02:12:02.347
BECAUSE WE KNOW THIS IS NOT-

02:12:02.414 --> 02:12:04.950
SORT OF A FREE ENDEAVOR- BUT

02:12:05.017 --> 02:12:07.052
WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT- IT CAN

02:12:07.119 --> 02:12:09.521
HELP SPOTLIGHT OPPORTUNITIES

02:12:09.588 --> 02:12:11.056
FOR IMPROVING. OUR HEALTH CARE

02:12:11.123 --> 02:12:13.325
DELIVERY SYSTEM AND I THINK

02:12:13.392 --> 02:12:14.860
WE'VE ALREADY SEEN EVIDENCE OF

02:12:14.926 --> 02:12:16.995
THIS BASED ON SOME WORK THAT'S

02:12:17.062 --> 02:12:18.964
BEEN GOING ON IN THE STATE OF

02:12:19.031 --> 02:12:19.831
THROUGH THE INTEGRATED

02:12:19.898 --> 02:12:21.566
HEALTHCARE ASSOCIATION WHICH

02:12:21.633 --> 02:12:24.169
HAS COMPILED A MULTI STE- PAYER

02:12:24.236 --> 02:12:26.638
DATABASE- AND HAS BEEN USING

02:12:26.705 --> 02:12:29.675
THOSE DATA TO- ADDRESS MANY OF

02:12:29.741 --> 02:12:31.276
THE ITEMS THAT ARE SHOWN ON THE

02:12:31.343 --> 02:12:34.112
SLIDE- AND SO THE A. P. C. D.

02:12:34.179 --> 02:12:35.547
IS GOING TO TAKE THAT. EVEN

02:12:35.614 --> 02:12:39.117
FURTHER- SO WE WILL BE ABLE TO

02:12:39.184 --> 02:12:40.652
NOT ONLY UNDERSTAND TRENDS AND

02:12:40.719 --> 02:12:42.387
SPENDING SOME OF WHICH- KATE

02:12:42.454 --> 02:12:44.823
HAD SHOWN- AND THAT PASSED

02:12:44.890 --> 02:12:47.092
PRESENTATION- BUT WILL BE ABLE

02:12:47.159 --> 02:12:49.895
TO LOOK AT. THE EFFECTS OF

02:12:49.961 --> 02:12:51.530
PROVIDER CONSOLIDATION ED MAYBE

02:12:51.596 --> 02:12:53.398
BE ABLE TO HAVE- EARLIER

02:12:53.465 --> 02:12:56.635
WARNING SIGNS WHERE THAT'S

02:12:56.702 --> 02:12:57.602
HAPPENING AND BE IT WILL TO

02:12:57.669 --> 02:12:58.103
THINK ABOUT HOW TO MOD

02:12:58.170 --> 02:13:00.539
DIFFERENT POLICIES TO AFFECT

02:13:00.605 --> 02:13:03.008
CONSOLIDATION- AND TO

02:13:03.075 --> 02:13:04.476
UNDERSTAND WHETHER THOSE

02:13:04.543 --> 02:13:06.678
POLICIES HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE-

02:13:06.745 --> 02:13:11.450
SIMILARLY- THERE'S A LOT OF

02:13:11.516 --> 02:13:12.050
EXPERIMENTATION GOING ON. THE

02:13:12.117 --> 02:13:13.518
PLACE AROUND ROOF AND THINKING

02:13:13.585 --> 02:13:16.288
ABOUT WHETHER AS WE MOVE TO A

02:13:16.355 --> 02:13:19.124
DIFFERENT TYPES OF PAYMENTS SO-

02:13:19.191 --> 02:13:21.727
TOWARDS MORE CAPITATION- OR

02:13:21.793 --> 02:13:24.963
HOLDING UP PROVIDERS AT RISK-

02:13:25.030 --> 02:13:26.565
FOR NOT ONLY COST BUT ALSO

02:13:26.631 --> 02:13:29.201
QUALITY PERFORMANCE- ARE THOSE

02:13:29.267 --> 02:13:31.136
EFFECTIVE MECHANISMS FOR TRYING

02:13:31.203 --> 02:13:33.171
TO DRIVE IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR

02:13:33.238 --> 02:13:35.240
DELIVERY SYSTEM. SO LET'S GO ON

02:13:35.307 --> 02:13:40.245
TO THE NEXT SLIDE- SAID- SIDE

02:13:40.312 --> 02:13:41.880
SEVEN. SO IN ADDITION TO

02:13:41.947 --> 02:13:44.082
ADDRESSING COST ISSUES- THE

02:13:44.149 --> 02:13:46.051
HEALTH CARE PAYMENT DATABASE

02:13:46.118 --> 02:13:48.587
ALSO HAS- AT THE ABILITY TO

02:13:48.653 --> 02:13:50.922
HELP PROVIDE A LOT OF INSIGHTS

02:13:50.989 --> 02:13:53.992
INTO OTHER KEY QUESTIONS THAT

02:13:54.059 --> 02:13:56.027
WE AS CALIFORNIANS ARE VERY

02:13:56.094 --> 02:13:58.663
CONCERNED ABOUT- AND THAT

02:13:58.730 --> 02:13:59.965
INCLUDES DISPARITIES IN HEALTH

02:14:00.031 --> 02:14:02.100
CARE- AND UNDERSTANDING THE

02:14:02.167 --> 02:14:04.669
ROLE OF SOCIAL RISK FACTORS-

02:14:04.736 --> 02:14:06.905
IN- QUALITY PERFORMANCE BUT

02:14:06.972 --> 02:14:08.807
ALSO IN TERMS OF HEALTH CARE

02:14:08.874 --> 02:14:11.276
OUTCOMES- WE ALSO ANT TO TRY

02:14:11.343 --> 02:14:12.711
TO UNDERSTAND ARE CERTAIN

02:14:12.778 --> 02:14:14.346
PROVIDERS MORE EFFICIENT THAN

02:14:14.413 --> 02:14:17.082
OTHERS. AND IF SO WHAT

02:14:17.149 --> 02:14:19.284
CHARACTERIZES THOSE PROVIDERS

02:14:19.351 --> 02:14:20.919
AND WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM

02:14:20.986 --> 02:14:22.654
THOSE PROVIDERS THAT CAN BE

02:14:22.721 --> 02:14:25.390
POTENTIALLY- ADOPTED BY OTHER

02:14:25.457 --> 02:14:27.459
PROVIDERS IN THE MARKET PLACE-

02:14:27.526 --> 02:14:30.362
AND IMPORTANTLY- AND- SPEAKING

02:14:30.429 --> 02:14:33.532
TO- ONE OF THE SLIDES THAT KATE

02:14:33.598 --> 02:14:35.534
SHOWED YOU ABOUT VALUE IN

02:14:35.600 --> 02:14:37.869
HEALTH CARE- WE NEED TO KNOW

02:14:37.936 --> 02:14:39.738
WHAT THE QUALITY OF CARE IS

02:14:39.805 --> 02:14:40.472
THAT'S BEING DELIVERED IN THE

02:14:40.539 --> 02:14:42.941
MARKETPLACE- AND WHAT WE ARE

02:14:43.008 --> 02:14:44.109
GETTING FOR THE MONEY WE ARE

02:14:44.176 --> 02:14:46.778
SPENDING. SO THESE ARE ALL- THE

02:14:46.845 --> 02:14:48.580
ARRAY OF THINGS THAT CAN BE

02:14:48.647 --> 02:14:52.117
CONSIDERED- FOR- LOOKING AT

02:14:52.184 --> 02:14:54.820
WITH THE ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATA

02:14:54.886 --> 02:14:56.121
SO LET'S MOVE ON TO THE NEXT

02:14:56.188 --> 02:14:58.256
SECTION WHICH I THINK IS REALLY

02:14:58.323 --> 02:15:00.025
KIND OF WHERE THE ACTION IS-

02:15:00.091 --> 02:15:02.060
WHICH IS HOW WILL WE USE THE

02:15:02.127 --> 02:15:04.062
DATA THIS THIS GREAT RESOURCE

02:15:04.129 --> 02:15:05.597
THAT'S GOING TO BE IN FRONT OF

02:15:05.664 --> 02:15:07.265
US. TO THINK ABOUT SOLVING

02:15:07.332 --> 02:15:09.434

02:15:13.905 --> 02:15:15.707
THEY'RE ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATA.

02:15:15.774 --> 02:15:18.810

BETTER VALUE FOR THE SPEND- AND

02:15:41.099 --> 02:15:41.633

WHAT MEDICARE PAYS FOR THE SAME

02:19:09.407 --> 02:19:13.545
SETS OF SERVICES- AND THAT THIS

02:19:13.611 --> 02:19:15.447
IS RAISING A LOT OF QUESTIONS

02:19:15.513 --> 02:19:17.549
IN THE MARKETPLACE ABOUT WHAT

ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATA. SO THIS

02:19:50.381 --> 02:19:52.851
IS SORTING BY COUNTY IN THE

02:19:52.917 --> 02:19:56.988
STATE OF COLORADO- THE RELATIVE

02:19:57.055 --> 02:19:59.524
PRICES PAID. FOR HOSPITAL

02:19:59.591 --> 02:20:02.026

02:20:08.466 --> 02:20:11.269
TIMES- THE MEDICARE PRICES SO

02:20:11.336 --> 02:20:13.238
AGAIN TRYING TO SPOTLIGHT

02:20:13.304 --> 02:20:16.274
OPPORTUNITIES FOR SAVINGS- IN

02:20:16.341 --> 02:20:18.009
DIFFERENT MARKETS AROUND THAT

02:20:18.076 --> 02:20:21.746
STATE. IF WE GO TO THE NEXT

02:20:21.813 --> 02:20:24.916
SLIDE- MASSACHUSETTS- HAS BEEN

02:20:24.983 --> 02:20:28.153
VERY ACTIVE IN LEVERAGING THEIR

02:20:28.219 --> 02:20:30.088
ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATA. AND THEY

02:20:30.155 --> 02:20:32.123
HAVE A HOSPITAL- I'M SORRY A

02:20:32.190 --> 02:20:34.626
HEALTH POLICY COMMISSION- THAT

02:20:34.692 --> 02:20:37.095
WAS- FORMS THAT I'M SORT OF

02:20:37.162 --> 02:20:39.864
LATE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE EARLY

02:20:39.931 --> 02:20:42.100
AT TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. WHERE

02:20:42.167 --> 02:20:46.738
THIS GROUP MEETS- TO DISCUSS

02:20:46.805 --> 02:20:47.772
TRENDS THAT THEY'RE SEEING IN

02:20:47.839 --> 02:20:50.809
THE DATA- AND TO SET BENCHMARKS

02:20:50.875 --> 02:20:51.910
FOR WHERE THEY WOULD LIKE

02:20:51.976 --> 02:20:53.912
SPENDING IN THE STATE TO BE-

02:20:53.978 --> 02:20:55.980
AND THEY MONITOR PERFORMANCE

02:20:56.047 --> 02:20:58.650
AGAINST THOSE BENCHMARKS. AND

02:20:58.716 --> 02:20:59.884
WHAT YOU CAN SEE ON THIS SLIDE

02:20:59.951 --> 02:21:03.054
IS THAT- AFTER FORMATION OF

02:21:03.121 --> 02:21:04.856
THIS HEALTH POLICY COMMISSION

02:21:04.923 --> 02:21:08.493
AND ACTIVE FOCUS ON COST

02:21:08.560 --> 02:21:10.261
CONTAINMENT IN THAT STATE.

02:21:10.328 --> 02:21:12.397
MASSACHUSETTS WHILE IT IS

02:21:12.463 --> 02:21:14.632
MIRRORING NATIONAL TRENDS IT

02:21:14.699 --> 02:21:16.601
MANAGED TO BRING IT SPENDING

02:21:16.668 --> 02:21:19.470
BELOW THE NATIONAL TREND AND TO

02:21:19.537 --> 02:21:24.242
KEEP IT THERE. IF WE GO ON TO

02:21:24.309 --> 02:21:26.978
THE NEXT SLIDE SLIDE FIFTEEN.

02:21:27.045 --> 02:21:28.246
THE NEXT FEW SLIDES I'M GOING

02:21:28.313 --> 02:21:32.217
TO- SHOW YOU A NUMBER OF OTHER

02:21:32.283 --> 02:21:33.318
WAYS IN WHICH THAT

02:21:33.384 --> 02:21:36.187
MASSACHUSETTS ISSUES THEIR DATA

02:21:36.254 --> 02:21:38.423
THAT SO IN THIS NEXT SLIDE-

02:21:38.489 --> 02:21:41.759
WHAT THIS DOES IS IT TAKES

02:21:41.826 --> 02:21:42.393
SPENDING YEAR OVER YEAR. AND IT

02:21:42.460 --> 02:21:44.195
BREAKS IT INTO THE VARIOUS

02:21:44.262 --> 02:21:46.531
COMPONENTS WHETHER IT'S THE

02:21:46.598 --> 02:21:47.866
COMMERCIAL PORTION OF THE

02:21:47.932 --> 02:21:50.301
MARKET PLACE MEDICARE- MASS

02:21:50.368 --> 02:21:51.970
HEALTH IS THE PUBLIC PORTION

02:21:52.036 --> 02:21:54.105
AND SO ON. AND WHAT THEY'RE

02:21:54.172 --> 02:21:55.974
REALLY LOOKING TO DO IS TO

02:21:56.040 --> 02:21:58.076
TRACK NOT ONLY OVERALL

02:21:58.142 --> 02:22:00.378
INCREASES IN THE MARKETPLACE

02:22:00.445 --> 02:22:01.846
BUT TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND HOW

02:22:01.913 --> 02:22:04.048
THAT BREAKS OUT BY. TYPE OF

02:22:04.115 --> 02:22:06.618
PAYER. IF WE GO ON TO THE NEXT

02:22:06.684 --> 02:22:12.323
SLIDE. SO ON SLIDE SIXTEEN WHAT

02:22:12.390 --> 02:22:14.759
YOU'RE NOW SEEING AS AT THE

02:22:14.826 --> 02:22:17.262
DATA ARE NOW BROKEN OUT BY TYPE

02:22:17.328 --> 02:22:20.064
OF SPENDING AREA WHETHER THAT'S

02:22:20.131 --> 02:22:22.000
INPATIENT HOSPITAL CARE.

02:22:22.066 --> 02:22:24.269
HOSPITAL OUTPATIENT CARE

02:22:24.335 --> 02:22:26.971
PHARMACY PHYSICIAN SERVICES AND

02:22:27.038 --> 02:22:29.674
SO ONAND AGAIN TRACKING WHERE

02:22:29.741 --> 02:22:31.109
SOME OF THE BIGGEST CHANGES

02:22:31.175 --> 02:22:32.610
HAVE BANNED AND IN THIS CASE

02:22:32.677 --> 02:22:38.016
PHARMACY- WAS A BIG- YOU'RE

02:22:38.082 --> 02:22:40.685
OVER YEAR INCREASE AREA. IF WE

02:22:40.752 --> 02:22:44.389
GO ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE. SLIDE

02:22:44.455 --> 02:22:48.626
SEVENTEEN- HERE AS THEY ARE

02:22:48.693 --> 02:22:52.530
BREAKING OUT COSTS BASED ON-

02:22:52.597 --> 02:22:55.099
SEGMENTS OF THE MARKET AB IN

02:22:55.166 --> 02:22:56.367
THIS CASE LARGE GROUP

02:22:56.434 --> 02:22:59.404
INSURANCE. OF VERSES THE SELF

02:22:59.470 --> 02:23:01.973
INSURED- SO AS I MENTIONED

02:23:02.040 --> 02:23:04.142
EARLIER THIS PRESENTATION AT

02:23:04.208 --> 02:23:05.777
THE HEALTH CARE MARKET PLACE IS

02:23:05.843 --> 02:23:08.579
VERY FRAGMENTED IN TERMS OF-

02:23:08.646 --> 02:23:09.847
ALL THESE DIFFERENT PRODUCTS

02:23:09.914 --> 02:23:11.716
THE WAY THEY'RE STRUCTURED THE

02:23:11.783 --> 02:23:13.785
TYPES OF INCENTIVES THAT ARE

02:23:13.851 --> 02:23:15.620
BUILT INTO THEM AND SO ON. AND

02:23:15.687 --> 02:23:17.922
SO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

02:23:17.989 --> 02:23:19.824
TRY TO BOTH UNDERSTAND THE

02:23:19.891 --> 02:23:22.260
LARGER PICTURE AND AGGREGATED

02:23:22.327 --> 02:23:24.195
WAY BUT ALSO TO BREAK IT OUT

02:23:24.262 --> 02:23:26.931
AND UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING

02:23:26.998 --> 02:23:27.465
IN EACH OF THESE DIFFERENT

02:23:27.532 --> 02:23:29.834
SEGMENTS. IF WE GO TO THE NEXT

02:23:29.901 --> 02:23:35.740
SLIDE. SO I MENTIONED THAT-

02:23:35.807 --> 02:23:37.875
PAYERS ARE EXPERIMENTING WITH

02:23:37.942 --> 02:23:40.244
ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MODELS SO

02:23:40.311 --> 02:23:43.314
ONE OF THESE- TYPES OF MODELS-

02:23:43.381 --> 02:23:44.649
IS REFERRED TO AS ACCOUNTABLE

02:23:44.716 --> 02:23:46.918
CARE ORGANIZATIONS WHERE

02:23:46.985 --> 02:23:48.386
PROVIDERS WHO ENTER INTO THESE

02:23:48.453 --> 02:23:50.621
CONTRACTS WITH INSURERS ARE

02:23:50.688 --> 02:23:52.623
ACCOUNTABLE FOR DELIVERING

02:23:52.690 --> 02:23:55.026
QUALITY CARE BUT ALSO HOLDING

02:23:55.093 --> 02:23:58.062
SPENDING DOWN. AND WHAT

02:23:58.129 --> 02:24:00.098
MASSACHUSETTS WAS TRYING TO

02:24:00.164 --> 02:24:01.866
BETTER UNDERSTAND IS WHAT WAS

02:24:01.933 --> 02:24:02.934
THE ADOPTION OF THESE

02:24:03.001 --> 02:24:05.370
DIFFERENT- ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT

02:24:05.436 --> 02:24:08.773
MODELS FIVE MARKET SEGMENT- AND

02:24:08.840 --> 02:24:11.275
WHAT YOU CAN SEE ON THIS SLIDE

02:24:11.342 --> 02:24:13.211
IS THAT IN THE COMMERCIAL. SIDE

02:24:13.277 --> 02:24:15.246
OF THE BUSINESS- IT'S BEEN

02:24:15.313 --> 02:24:17.081
RELATIVELY STABLE IN TERMS OF

02:24:17.148 --> 02:24:18.750
THE ADOPTION OF THOSE MODELS

02:24:18.816 --> 02:24:20.184
AND WHERE IT HAS REALLY TAKEN

02:24:20.251 --> 02:24:21.486
OFF IS IF YOU LOOK IN THE

02:24:21.552 --> 02:24:24.188
MIDDLE PART OF THE SLIDE- UNDER

02:24:24.255 --> 02:24:28.826
MASS- M. CO A CEO. IS THE-

02:24:28.893 --> 02:24:31.529
PUBLIC- THAT PAYMENT SYSTEM HAS

02:24:31.596 --> 02:24:35.233
REALLY SHIFTED TO ADOPTING

02:24:35.299 --> 02:24:35.767
THESE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT

02:24:35.833 --> 02:24:41.305
MODELS. NEXT SLIDE SO THAT

02:24:41.372 --> 02:24:43.207
GIVES YOU A SNAPSHOT OF SOME OF

02:24:43.274 --> 02:24:46.044
THE- USE CASES- THERE ARE MANY

02:24:46.110 --> 02:24:49.280
MANY MORE- AND I'D BE HAPPY TO

JUST BEFORE I CLOSE OUT

02:24:55.820 --> 02:24:59.023
MENTIONED SOME KEY ASPECTS.

02:24:59.090 --> 02:25:00.858

CALIFORNIA ALL PAYER CLAIMS

02:25:02.527 --> 02:25:06.097
DATABASE. SO THE WAY IN WHICH

02:25:06.164 --> 02:25:08.266
THESE DATABASES ARE TYPICALLY

02:25:08.332 --> 02:25:10.635
BUILT ARE BASED ON CLAIMS

02:25:10.701 --> 02:25:12.837
INSURANCE CLAIMS FOR FEE FOR

CAPITATED MODELS- AND

02:25:24.415 --> 02:25:25.550
INCREASINGLY WITH THESE

ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MODELS

02:25:27.485 --> 02:25:29.320
OTHER FORMS OF PAYMENTS THAT

RECEIVING IN THE FORM OF

02:25:52.777 --> 02:25:55.012
CAPITATED PAYMENTS. SAIDTHIS

02:25:55.079 --> 02:25:57.014
IS A CRITICAL ASPECT OF THE

02:25:57.081 --> 02:25:59.217
DATABASE AS IT GETS BUILT AND

02:25:59.283 --> 02:26:01.953
LOOKING TO FIND WAYS TO INCLUDE

02:26:02.019 --> 02:26:03.754
THESE DATA. IF WE GO TO THE

02:26:03.821 --> 02:26:08.993
NEXT SLIDE. AS I MENTIONED-

02:26:09.060 --> 02:26:10.328
THIS IS A BIG PART OF THE

02:26:10.394 --> 02:26:12.697
CALIFORNIA PICTURE IN TERMS OF

02:26:12.763 --> 02:26:13.731
THESE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT

02:26:13.798 --> 02:26:16.901
MODELS- BUT OTHER STATES HAVE

02:26:16.968 --> 02:26:18.703
FOUND WAYS TO COLLECT THESE AND

02:26:18.769 --> 02:26:20.972
WE NEED TO LEARN FROM THEM HOW

02:26:21.038 --> 02:26:22.874
THEY'VE DONE IT. BUT ALSO I

02:26:22.940 --> 02:26:25.076
WOULD AGAIN REMIND PEOPLE THAT

02:26:25.143 --> 02:26:26.677
HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

02:26:26.744 --> 02:26:27.478
THE INTEGRATED HEALTHCARE

02:26:27.545 --> 02:26:30.348
ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN WORKING TO

02:26:30.414 --> 02:26:32.216
DO THIS FOR YEARS AND THERE'S

02:26:32.283 --> 02:26:33.918
MUCH TO LEARN FROM THAT

02:26:33.985 --> 02:26:36.787
ORGANIZATION TO ENSURE THAT WE

02:26:36.854 --> 02:26:41.959
CAPTURE THOSE DATA. SO ON TO

02:26:42.026 --> 02:26:43.161
THE KEY ISSUES FOR THE

02:26:43.227 --> 02:26:45.163
CALIFORNIA APCD DATA IN

02:26:45.229 --> 02:26:46.664
ADDITION TO THESE ALTERNATIVE

02:26:46.731 --> 02:26:49.300
PAYMENTS- IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT

02:26:49.367 --> 02:26:51.235
WE INCLUDE THE MEDIC CAL DATA-

02:26:51.302 --> 02:26:53.271
BECAUSE A THIRD OF CALIFORNIANS

02:26:53.337 --> 02:26:55.106
ARE COVERED UNDER THIS

02:26:55.173 --> 02:26:57.375
INSURANCE MECHANISM. WE ALSO

02:26:57.441 --> 02:26:58.409
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:26:58.476 --> 02:27:01.345
CONTRACT HAITIANS- WITH UNIQUE

02:27:01.412 --> 02:27:03.548
PATIENT IDENTIFIERS BECAUSE WE

02:27:03.614 --> 02:27:05.216
KNOW THAT THERE'S CHURNING IN

02:27:05.283 --> 02:27:06.517
THE INSURANCE MARKET AND

02:27:06.584 --> 02:27:09.253
PATIENTS WILL SHIFT. IN AND OUT

02:27:09.320 --> 02:27:11.322
OF MEDICAID OR IN AN OFFICE IN

02:27:11.389 --> 02:27:14.592
AND OUT OF THE ACT CALIFORNIA

02:27:14.659 --> 02:27:16.561
HEALTH INSURANCE EXCHANGE. SO

02:27:16.627 --> 02:27:18.296
IT'S A CRITICAL THAT WE FIND

02:27:18.362 --> 02:27:19.864
WAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:27:19.931 --> 02:27:22.233
UNDERSTAND WHETHER. PATIENTS

02:27:22.300 --> 02:27:24.869
ARE CONTINUOUSLY COVERED- AND

02:27:24.936 --> 02:27:26.204
WHAT TYPES OF INSURANCE-

02:27:26.270 --> 02:27:30.508
THEY'VE HAD OVER TIME. AT THE

02:27:30.575 --> 02:27:33.177
OTHER- PIECE OF THIS IS HAVING

02:27:33.244 --> 02:27:35.813
UNIQUE PROVIDER IDENTIFIERS-

02:27:35.880 --> 02:27:38.316
THAT CAN BE MAPPED TO-

02:27:38.382 --> 02:27:40.117
PHYSICIAN ORGANIZATIONS AND TO

02:27:40.184 --> 02:27:42.086
HEALTH SYSTEMS. BECAUSE WE

02:27:42.153 --> 02:27:44.055
RECOGNIZE THAT INDIVIDUAL

02:27:44.121 --> 02:27:45.856
PROVIDERS TYPICALLY WORK IN

02:27:45.923 --> 02:27:48.459
LARGER ORGANIZATIONS AND THOSE

02:27:48.526 --> 02:27:50.461
LARGER ORGANIZATIONS BRING

02:27:50.528 --> 02:27:51.729
THINGS TO THE TABLE THAT CAN

02:27:51.796 --> 02:27:53.965
EITHER HELP IMPROVE THE QUALITY

02:27:54.031 --> 02:27:56.901
OF CARE OR ADD COSTS. AND SO

02:27:56.968 --> 02:27:59.070
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE

02:27:59.136 --> 02:28:00.471
CONNECTEDNESS OF ALL THESE

02:28:00.538 --> 02:28:02.607
DIFFERENT PLAYERS INTO THESE

02:28:02.673 --> 02:28:04.141
ORGANIZATIONS WHETHER IT'S

02:28:04.208 --> 02:28:05.743
MEDICAL GROUPS HOSPITALS OR

02:28:05.810 --> 02:28:08.379
HEALTH SYSTEMS IS VITALLY

02:28:08.446 --> 02:28:11.182
IMPORTANT FOR THE STATUS AT I

02:28:11.249 --> 02:28:13.351
SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT- WHILE

02:28:13.417 --> 02:28:15.253
THE STATE HAS RESOURCES TO

02:28:15.319 --> 02:28:17.455
LEVERAGE. INFORMATION COMING

02:28:17.521 --> 02:28:19.890
OUT OF THE STATE ASIDE- IT IS

02:28:19.957 --> 02:28:21.826
GOING TO BE VITALLY IMPORTANT

02:28:21.892 --> 02:28:24.061
THAT THE DATA BECOME AVAILABLE

02:28:24.128 --> 02:28:25.963
TO THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY WHO

02:28:26.030 --> 02:28:27.965
CAN REALLY HELP CALIFORNIA

02:28:28.032 --> 02:28:30.234
LEVERAGE THE INFORMATION OUT TO

02:28:30.301 --> 02:28:31.702
ADDRESS THE CRITICAL QUESTIONS

02:28:31.769 --> 02:28:34.038
THAT ARE BEING ASKED ABOUT. HOW

02:28:34.105 --> 02:28:36.140
DO WE TRY TO IMPROVE THE

02:28:36.207 --> 02:28:38.676
AFFORDABILITY OF HEALTH CARE.

02:28:38.743 --> 02:28:41.078
SO LET ME JUST CLOSE OUT- IF WE

02:28:41.145 --> 02:28:45.349
GO TO SLIDE TWENTY TWO SO AS I

02:28:45.416 --> 02:28:45.916

02:28:45.983 --> 02:28:48.352

SEE THAT THESE RISING COSTS ARE

03:01:16.198 --> 03:01:18.500
GENERATING NOT ONLY A COST

03:01:18.567 --> 03:01:20.903
PROBLEM AN ECONOMIC PROBLEM

THIS PROGRAM. THEY STARTED OUT

03:02:50.326 --> 03:02:52.261

ACCOUNT NOT ONLY PRICES BUT

03:03:08.143 --> 03:03:10.112
UTILIZATION AND FACTORS THAT

03:03:10.179 --> 03:03:11.814
AFFECT BOTH OF THOSE THINGS

03:03:11.880 --> 03:03:14.116

TWO POPULATIONS ARE PRETTY BIG

03:03:50.853 --> 03:03:53.222

03:05:33.255 --> 03:05:34.790
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES THAT WORK

03:05:34.857 --> 03:05:37.125

GOVERNMENT AGENCY IT'S GOT

03:05:48.904 --> 03:05:50.906
INDEPENDENT MEMBERS- AND THEY

MENTIONED THEY HAVE THIS

03:06:08.490 --> 03:06:10.359
INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY PLUS THEY

03:06:10.425 --> 03:06:12.494
HAVE A VERY FAIRLY ELABORATE A

VARIOUS ASPECTS. WHICH THEY-

03:06:19.334 --> 03:06:20.936
KILL ME MAKES THE WHOLE PROCESS

03:06:21.003 --> 03:06:22.604
MORE EFFICIENT THEY DON'T

03:06:22.671 --> 03:06:24.373
DEVELOP DATA COLLECTION PLANS

03:06:24.439 --> 03:06:25.374
THAT ARE INEFFICIENT FOR

03:06:25.440 --> 03:06:26.575
EXAMPLE BY INCLUDING

UNDERSTAND EARLY ON OKAY THIS

03:06:29.945 --> 03:06:31.647
FIELD IS JUST WAY TOO EXPENSIVE

03:06:31.713 --> 03:06:33.248
TO ADD TO OUR DATA COLLECTION.

03:06:33.315 --> 03:06:34.383
THIS YEAR WE NEED TO PUT THAT

OFF TO YOUR TO OUR TWO YEAR

03:06:36.718 --> 03:06:37.185
THREE THINGS LIKE THAT SO

03:06:37.252 --> 03:06:39.555
THEY'VE LEARNED ABOUT. HOW TO

03:06:39.621 --> 03:06:42.891
DO THAT. A OR A AND THE COOK

03:06:42.958 --> 03:06:44.293
THAT THEY ALSO HAVE THE

03:06:44.359 --> 03:06:46.328
AUTHORITY TO MONITOR SPENDING.

03:06:46.395 --> 03:06:47.462
OF WHAT'S CALLED HEALTH CARE

03:06:47.529 --> 03:06:49.464
ENTITIES WHICH COULD BE MEDICAL

GROUPS HOSPITALS INSURANCE

03:06:51.233 --> 03:06:53.702
PLANS ED IF THE GROWTH RATES

03:06:53.769 --> 03:06:55.871
ARE IT EXCESS OF THE TARGETS

03:06:55.938 --> 03:06:57.606
THAT THEY SET EACH YEAR. THEY

03:06:57.673 --> 03:06:59.841
HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DIG IN.

03:06:59.908 --> 03:07:02.711
AND DEMAND- REMEDIAL PLANS FROM

ALSO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO

03:07:05.647 --> 03:07:07.549
REVIEW TRANSACTIONS. AND IF

03:07:07.616 --> 03:07:08.584
THEY THINK THOSE TRANSACTIONS

03:07:08.650 --> 03:07:12.087
ARE ANTI COMPETITIVE REFER THEM

03:07:12.154 --> 03:07:13.121
TO THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL.

03:07:13.188 --> 03:07:17.559

SUMMARIZES THOSE FOUR STATES

03:07:19.127 --> 03:07:21.029
SOME OF THE KEY FEATURES AS I

03:07:21.096 --> 03:07:22.164
MENTIONED THEY VERY IN THEIR

03:07:22.230 --> 03:07:23.799
SCOPE OF THE TYPES OF-

FOR GROWTH IN HEALTHCARE

03:07:31.807 --> 03:07:34.109
SPENDING AND IT'S TIED IN SOME

03:07:34.176 --> 03:07:37.245
WAY TO PROJECTED STATE GDP SO

03:07:37.312 --> 03:07:39.114
THAT'S HOW THEY'RE KIND OF-

03:07:39.181 --> 03:07:42.384
TIDYING HEALTHCARE SPENDING TO

03:07:42.451 --> 03:07:44.119
AFFORDABILITY IF OUR ECONOMY

03:07:44.186 --> 03:07:45.754
GROWS AT A CERTAIN RATE WE

03:07:45.821 --> 03:07:47.856
SHOULD BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO

03:07:47.923 --> 03:07:49.558
SPEND MORE ON HEALTHCARE BUT

03:07:49.625 --> 03:07:52.194
NOT MORE. THAN WERE- INCREASING

03:07:52.260 --> 03:07:56.565
IN TERMS OF OUR ECONOMIC OUTPUT.

03:07:56.632 --> 03:07:58.467
ALL RIGHT NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.

03:07:58.533 --> 03:07:59.635
ABOUT ONE MORE HERE WE GO SO

03:07:59.701 --> 03:08:01.436
CALIFORNIA MY CONSIDER SOME OF

03:08:01.503 --> 03:08:02.871
THE IMPORTANT FEATURES IN THESE

03:08:02.938 --> 03:08:05.040
PROGRAMS THE VALUE OF EXPLICIT

03:08:05.107 --> 03:08:07.042
BENCHMARKS THE AUTHORITY TO

03:08:07.109 --> 03:08:08.844
COLLECT COMPREHENSIVE DATA.

03:08:08.910 --> 03:08:10.145
GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE THAT

03:08:10.212 --> 03:08:10.879
INCLUDES STAKEHOLDER

03:08:10.946 --> 03:08:12.881
COLLABORATION AND THEN SOME OF

03:08:12.948 --> 03:08:14.249
THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS THAT

03:08:14.316 --> 03:08:16.118
ARE PRESENT IN THE STATE'S

03:08:16.184 --> 03:08:17.519
MIGHT BE HELPFUL IN A

03:08:17.586 --> 03:08:19.855
CALIFORNIA TYPE MODEL. NEXT

03:08:19.921 --> 03:08:24.760
SLIDE PLEASE. NO MATTER WHICH

03:08:24.826 --> 03:08:26.461
DIRECTION CALIFORNIA GOES I

03:08:26.528 --> 03:08:28.563
HIGHLY ENCOURAGE CALIFORNIA TO

03:08:28.630 --> 03:08:31.366
MOVE QUICKLY. TO ESTABLISH A

03:08:31.433 --> 03:08:32.668
SOME KIND OF AN OFFICE FOR

03:08:32.734 --> 03:08:34.703
AFFORDABILITY. AND COST

03:08:34.770 --> 03:08:38.707
MONITORING RATE MARILYN I THINK

03:08:38.774 --> 03:08:39.274
IS A REALLY WORTHWHILE MODEL

03:08:39.341 --> 03:08:40.042
BECAUSE IT'S THE MOST

03:08:40.108 --> 03:08:41.243
COMPREHENSIVE THEY'VE BEEN

03:08:41.309 --> 03:08:42.678
DOING IT FOR MANY YEARS THEY'VE

03:08:42.744 --> 03:08:44.279
KIND OF LEARNED THE HARD WAY

03:08:44.346 --> 03:08:45.714
WHAT DATA WE CAN GET EASILY

03:08:45.781 --> 03:08:47.816
WHAT DATASETS RELIABLE THINGS

03:08:47.883 --> 03:08:50.118
LIKE THAT. THEY'VE OFFERED TO

03:08:50.185 --> 03:08:52.220
WORK WITH CALIFORNIA'S STAFF

03:08:52.287 --> 03:08:53.555
AND ANY KIND OF A TASK FORCE

03:08:53.622 --> 03:08:55.490
THAT YOU BUY FOR. TO GIVE US

03:08:55.557 --> 03:08:57.392
THEIR THE LESSONS LEARNED AND

03:08:57.459 --> 03:08:59.061
HOW WE MIGHT FACE IN DATA

03:08:59.127 --> 03:09:02.731
COLLECTION- SO I THINK IT'S A

03:09:02.798 --> 03:09:06.168
WORTHWHILE MODEL TO EXPLORE-

03:09:06.234 --> 03:09:07.502
YOU KNOW AS I SAID BEFORE I

03:09:07.569 --> 03:09:09.337
RECOMMEND THAT WE MOVE QUICKLY.

03:09:09.404 --> 03:09:11.406
I THINK CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY

03:09:11.473 --> 03:09:12.974
IF WE IF WE GET GOING WITH THE

03:09:13.041 --> 03:09:15.577
COMMISSION. HAS THE OPPORTUNITY

03:09:15.644 --> 03:09:18.013
A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY SPENDING

03:09:18.080 --> 03:09:20.215
IS ACTUALLY GOING DOWN NOW FOR

03:09:20.282 --> 03:09:23.085
THE FIRST TIME. SINCE I'VE BEEN

03:09:23.151 --> 03:09:24.419
STUDYING HEALTH CARE. WHICH IS

03:09:24.486 --> 03:09:25.987
A LONG TIME AND THEN THE

03:09:26.054 --> 03:09:27.622
QUESTION IS CAN WE LEVERAGE

03:09:27.689 --> 03:09:30.559
THIS. YEAR UNFORTUNATE PANDEMIC

03:09:30.625 --> 03:09:32.427
WHICH IS REDUCING SPENDING TO

03:09:32.494 --> 03:09:36.164
SET A NEW LOWER COST BASE AND

03:09:36.231 --> 03:09:37.232
THEN MAYBE SAID GETS. THE DON'T

03:09:37.299 --> 03:09:40.235
ALLOW US TO REBOUND BACK TO

03:09:40.302 --> 03:09:41.570
WHERE WE WERE. ALL RIGHT SO WE

03:09:41.636 --> 03:09:43.438
HAVE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY BUT I

03:09:43.505 --> 03:09:44.406
DO THINK WE HAVE TO MOVE

03:09:44.473 --> 03:09:46.408
QUICKLY BUT AGAIN I THINK THE

03:09:46.475 --> 03:09:49.311
DATA- COULD BE MADE AVAILABLE

03:09:49.377 --> 03:09:52.280
QUICKLY. OF MARYLAND IN

03:09:52.347 --> 03:09:54.583
ADDITION TO HAVING AT ALL PAYER

03:09:54.649 --> 03:09:56.017
CLAIMS DATABASE LIKE THE ONE

03:09:56.084 --> 03:09:57.619
THAT CALIFORNIA'S GONNA HAVE.

03:09:57.686 --> 03:09:59.454
ALSO HAS THE AUTHORITY AND HAS

03:09:59.521 --> 03:10:01.823
DEVELOPED A MUCH MORE EXTENSIVE

03:10:01.890 --> 03:10:03.759
REPORTING SYSTEM. WHERE THEY

03:10:03.825 --> 03:10:05.227
DIFFER WHERE THEY REQUIRE

03:10:05.293 --> 03:10:07.863
AGGREGATE REPORTS FROM ENTITIES

03:10:07.929 --> 03:10:10.165
WITHIN THE STATE. THAT ARE MUCH

03:10:10.232 --> 03:10:12.100
MORE FEASIBLE AND ARE NOT

03:10:12.167 --> 03:10:13.034
SUBJECT TO THE ARREST OF

03:10:13.101 --> 03:10:15.103
CONSTRAINTS SO AGAIN I HIGHLY

03:10:15.170 --> 03:10:17.572
ENCOURAGE CALIFORNIA. TO TALK

03:10:17.639 --> 03:10:18.340
TO THE FOLKS THAT MEASURE IN

03:10:18.406 --> 03:10:20.509
MASSACHUSETTS FIGURE OUT WHAT

03:10:20.575 --> 03:10:21.743
THEY'VE GOT WHAT THOSE REPORTS

03:10:21.810 --> 03:10:24.279
LOOK LIKE- THAT WOULD SAVE US

03:10:24.346 --> 03:10:27.949
SOME TIME TO GET GOING QUICKLY.

03:10:28.016 --> 03:10:32.053
ALL RIGHT NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.

03:10:32.120 --> 03:10:35.223
LET'S SEE SO FEEL FINALLY I AS

03:10:35.290 --> 03:10:36.858
I MENTIONED IMMEDIATE ACTION-

03:10:36.925 --> 03:10:38.493
BECAUSE COSTS AND PRICES ARE

03:10:38.560 --> 03:10:40.162
GOING UP AS WE SPEAK. I

03:10:40.228 --> 03:10:41.696
MENTIONED EARLIER THE IDEA OF

03:10:41.763 --> 03:10:43.665
BUILDING ON THE RECENT ATTORNEY

03:10:43.732 --> 03:10:45.367
GENERAL SETTLEMENT AND THE

03:10:45.433 --> 03:10:47.235
TREMENDOUS RECORD THAT WAS

03:10:47.302 --> 03:10:49.337
BUILT THAT LAWSUIT STARTED IN

03:10:49.404 --> 03:10:51.373
TWENTY FOURTEEN. IT SHOWS YOU

03:10:51.439 --> 03:10:53.708
HOW OFTEN WE CANNOT RELY ON

03:10:53.775 --> 03:10:56.111
PRIVATE LAWSUITS TO BRING BACK

03:10:56.178 --> 03:10:58.146
COMPETITION TO THE MARKET WE

03:10:58.213 --> 03:11:00.348
NEED POLICYMAKERS TO ACT. WE'VE

03:11:00.415 --> 03:11:01.917
GOT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

03:11:01.983 --> 03:11:03.418
INFORMATION THAT WAS MADE

03:11:03.485 --> 03:11:04.953
PUBLIC THAT PREVIOUSLY WAS

03:11:05.020 --> 03:11:07.856
PRIVATE. THAT WE COULD STUDY

03:11:07.923 --> 03:11:08.590
AND WE COULD SEE FROM THAT

03:11:08.657 --> 03:11:11.026
SETTLEMENT. ELEMENTS THAT WOULD

03:11:11.092 --> 03:11:12.494
HELP TO RESTORE COMPETITION TO

03:11:12.561 --> 03:11:14.329
THE MARKET LIMITING ALL IN NON

03:11:14.396 --> 03:11:16.031
CONTRACTED WHICH IS ONLY GONNA

03:11:16.097 --> 03:11:18.066
GET WORSE NOW WITH THE PANDEMIC

03:11:18.133 --> 03:11:20.001
MORE THE SYSTEM FOR BUYING UP

03:11:20.068 --> 03:11:21.469
STRUGGLING HOSPITAL STRUGGLING

03:11:21.536 --> 03:11:23.038
MEDICAL GROUPS. WE'RE GETTING

03:11:23.104 --> 03:11:24.673
MORE AND MORE CONCENTRATED IT

03:11:24.739 --> 03:11:26.241
HEY THAT'S GOING TO GIVE THEM

03:11:26.308 --> 03:11:27.909
MORE POCKET POWER AND IF WE

03:11:27.976 --> 03:11:29.444
DON'T O SOMETHING TO PROTECT

03:11:29.511 --> 03:11:30.946
CONSUMERS THEY'RE GONNA COME

03:11:31.012 --> 03:11:33.815
BACK WITH BIG PRICE INCREASES.

03:11:33.882 --> 03:11:35.016
IN THE IS SUES THEIR CONTRACTS

03:11:35.083 --> 03:11:39.554
RUN OUT- SO. OUR RESEARCH THAT

03:11:39.621 --> 03:11:41.590
JUST THESE TWO POLICY CHANGES

03:11:41.656 --> 03:11:43.859
COULD LITERALLY SAVE BILLIONS

03:11:43.925 --> 03:11:45.026
FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS

03:11:45.093 --> 03:11:46.995
RELATIVELY QUICKLY MAYBE

03:11:47.062 --> 03:11:49.197
ESTABLISHED A NEW BENCHMARK OF

03:11:49.264 --> 03:11:51.199
SPENDING. UP AND GET OUR

03:11:51.266 --> 03:11:52.667
CONSUMER SOME SAVINGS AND A

03:11:52.734 --> 03:11:54.903
SLOWER GROWTH RATE. THANK YOU

03:11:54.970 --> 03:11:57.005
VERY MUCH. WELL THANK YOU VERY

03:11:57.072 --> 03:12:00.175
MUCH MELNICK. WE ARE WE'RE

03:12:00.242 --> 03:12:01.376
RUNNING UP AGAINST A LITTLE BIT

03:12:01.443 --> 03:12:04.079
OF A TIME CRUNCH HERE AND- I

03:12:04.145 --> 03:12:05.280
YOU KNOW NOT AND WE'VE SOME ARE

03:12:05.347 --> 03:12:07.415
MEMBERS OF A HAD TO MOVE ON BUT

03:12:07.482 --> 03:12:08.483
I SO I MAY FOLLOW UP

03:12:08.550 --> 03:12:10.352
INDIVIDUALLY WITH QUESTIONS- ON

03:12:10.418 --> 03:12:12.187
SOME OF THESE ISSUES BUT BUT I

03:12:12.254 --> 03:12:14.956
WANT TO JUST HIGHLIGHT ON- YOU

03:12:15.023 --> 03:12:15.490
KNOW WHAT WE'VE WHAT WE'VE

03:12:15.557 --> 03:12:16.458
HEARD HERE WE'VE GOT AN UPDATE

03:12:16.524 --> 03:12:17.692
ON THE ON THE DATABASE WE'VE

03:12:17.759 --> 03:12:20.028
GOT WE KNOW THE- THE VALUE OF

03:12:20.095 --> 03:12:21.563
THE DATABASE WHICH IS. THE

03:12:21.630 --> 03:12:23.732
FOUNDATION FOR US OF

03:12:23.798 --> 03:12:25.000
UNDERSTANDING HOW WE'RE

03:12:25.066 --> 03:12:27.269
SPENDING OUR MONEY HERE WE

03:12:27.335 --> 03:12:28.837
HEARD ABOUT SOME OF THE DATA

03:12:28.904 --> 03:12:30.305
WE'VE HEARD HOW THE DEPARTMENT

03:12:30.372 --> 03:12:32.741
MANAGED HEALTHCARE OPERATES AND

03:12:32.807 --> 03:12:34.075
WE'RE GETTING SOME EARLIER

03:12:34.142 --> 03:12:36.711
EARLY DATA ON ON- DRUG PRICE

03:12:36.778 --> 03:12:39.514
TRANSPARENCY. AND THOSE AND THE

03:12:39.581 --> 03:12:40.649
WAY I UNDERSTOOD THAT THOSE

03:12:40.715 --> 03:12:41.983
NUMBERS ARE ACTUALLY COMING IN

03:12:42.050 --> 03:12:43.818
HIGHER PERCENTAGE THAN WHAT

03:12:43.885 --> 03:12:45.654
WE'VE HEARD IN THE PAST WITH-

03:12:45.720 --> 03:12:48.256
THROUGH OTHER OTHER ESTIMATES

03:12:48.323 --> 03:12:49.658
WHICH MAKES THAT DRUG SPEND TO

03:12:49.724 --> 03:12:50.992
BE EVEN A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF

03:12:51.059 --> 03:12:52.627
THE OVERALL HEALTH CARE SPEND.

03:12:52.694 --> 03:12:57.032
SO THE VALUE OF TARGETS. AND

03:12:57.098 --> 03:12:58.667
LOOKING TO MARYLAND AS A

03:12:58.733 --> 03:13:00.535
PARTNER AS A PARTNER AS WE MOVE

03:13:00.602 --> 03:13:02.604
FORWARD ON SOME OF THESE THINGS

03:13:02.671 --> 03:13:04.439
LOOKING TO GO GLOBAL BUDGETING

03:13:04.506 --> 03:13:06.308
AND- WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT WITH

03:13:06.374 --> 03:13:07.976
YOU LOOKING AT THOSE TARGETS

03:13:08.043 --> 03:13:10.712
THOSE TARGETS- ARE OBVIOUSLY

03:13:10.779 --> 03:13:12.447
LOWER THAN WHAT WE'RE SPENDING

03:13:12.514 --> 03:13:14.683
CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA. I MEAN

03:13:14.749 --> 03:13:16.284
IF WE'RE AT THREE IN THE 3%

03:13:16.351 --> 03:13:18.954
RANGE. ON THOSE TARGETS WHETHER

03:13:19.020 --> 03:13:22.490
IT'S MARYLAND OR MASSACHUSETTS.

03:13:22.557 --> 03:13:23.825
OR I CAN'T REMEMBER THE OTHER

03:13:23.892 --> 03:13:25.527
STATE THERE BUT- YOU HAD TO

03:13:25.593 --> 03:13:28.730
GET- RHODE ISLAND AND OREGON

03:13:28.797 --> 03:13:30.231
THEY'RE ALL IN THE THREE

03:13:30.298 --> 03:13:32.968
PERCENTAGE RANGE AND WE'RE

03:13:33.034 --> 03:13:34.836
HIGHER THAN THAT IN CALIFORNIA

03:13:34.903 --> 03:13:37.639
SO OBVIOUSLY- THEY'RE DOING

03:13:37.706 --> 03:13:40.408
SOMETHING RIGHT AND WE'RE WE'RE

03:13:40.475 --> 03:13:42.377
AND WE'RE BEHIND THE ONE

03:13:42.444 --> 03:13:43.645
QUESTION I WOULD LIKE TO ASK

03:13:43.712 --> 03:13:45.113
YOU AND THEN AND THEN I'VE GOT

03:13:45.180 --> 03:13:46.448
OF SHIFT THE ORDER A LITTLE BIT

03:13:46.514 --> 03:13:48.283
I'M GONNA HAVE TO APOLOGIZE TO

03:13:48.350 --> 03:13:52.620
OUR SPEAKERS BUT- IS THE SKY

03:13:52.687 --> 03:13:53.621
FALLING. WITH WITH THE STAFF

03:13:53.688 --> 03:13:56.858
THESE. BY WE- YOU KNOW HOW IT

03:13:56.925 --> 03:13:58.059
DOESN'T IF THESE BEEN GOING ON

03:13:58.126 --> 03:13:59.894
FOR A WHILE NOW IN THE STATES.

03:13:59.961 --> 03:14:01.429
AND I THINK THE PUSH BACK WE

03:14:01.496 --> 03:14:02.797
WOULD POTENTIALLY GET IN

03:14:02.864 --> 03:14:06.234
CALIFORNIA'S. OH MY GOODNESS WE

03:14:06.301 --> 03:14:06.701
COULD NEVER DO THAT IN

03:14:06.768 --> 03:14:07.836
CALIFORNIA. SO IS THE

03:14:07.902 --> 03:14:10.505
HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM.

03:14:10.572 --> 03:14:13.041
FUNCTIONAL VIABLE IN THOSE

03:14:13.108 --> 03:14:16.778
STATES OR ARE THESE TARGETS WE

03:14:16.845 --> 03:14:18.847
EIGHTEEN- UNINTENDED

03:14:18.913 --> 03:14:22.817
CONSEQUENCES FOR ACCESS OF FOR

03:14:22.884 --> 03:14:25.253
AND QUALITY OF CARE. THAT'S FOR

03:14:25.320 --> 03:14:30.558
YOU DOCTOR MELNICK'S. QUESTION

03:14:30.625 --> 03:14:32.060
I THINK IT AS PART OF OUR

03:14:32.127 --> 03:14:33.728
RESEARCH FOR THE CALIFORNIA

03:14:33.795 --> 03:14:34.896
HEALTH CARE FOUNDATION WE DID

03:14:34.963 --> 03:14:36.798
INTERVIEW LOTS OF FOLKS IN THE

03:14:36.865 --> 03:14:41.603
STATES. NONE OF THEM REPORTED

03:14:41.669 --> 03:14:46.007
HEROES DOWN. YEAH TO- SETTING

03:14:46.074 --> 03:14:48.843
TARGETS AND ACHIEVING THEIR

03:14:48.910 --> 03:14:49.444
TARGETS SO AT THE END FORGET

03:14:49.511 --> 03:14:52.213
WE'RE STARTING FROM AN ENORMOUS

03:14:52.280 --> 03:14:55.950
COST BASE. AND SO AND THE THESE

03:14:56.017 --> 03:14:57.285
THE TARGETS THEY CENTER NOT

03:14:57.352 --> 03:15:01.523
DRACONIAN BY ANY MEANS- AND SO.

03:15:01.589 --> 03:15:04.025
THEY DIDN'T REPORT- YOU KNOW

DRIVING ISSUE OF MANY THINGS

03:17:40.748 --> 03:17:42.717
AND TALK ABOUT TODAY IS JUST

03:17:42.784 --> 03:17:44.285
THE GROWING CONCERN FOR HEALTH

03:17:44.352 --> 03:17:45.687
CARE AFFORDABILITY FOR MANY

03:17:45.753 --> 03:17:47.755
CALIFORNIANS IN A RECENT SURVEY

03:17:47.822 --> 03:17:48.957
CONDUCTED BY THE KAISER FAMILY

03:17:49.023 --> 03:17:51.793
FOUNDATION OF A CALIFORNIANS

03:17:51.859 --> 03:17:53.127
45% OF THOSE SURVEYED IN

03:17:53.194 --> 03:17:55.163
CALIFORNIA LISTED HEALTHCARE

03:17:55.230 --> 03:17:57.732
COSTS IS A GROWING CONCERN

03:17:57.799 --> 03:17:59.434
HEALTHCARE AFFORDABILITY. WHEN

03:17:59.500 --> 03:18:01.536
ASKED ABOUT SPECIFIC AREAS OF

03:18:01.603 --> 03:18:02.003
HEALTHCARE COSTS THEIR

03:18:02.070 --> 03:18:04.272
CONCERNS. ARE FIT THINGS LIKE

03:18:04.339 --> 03:18:06.174
MENTAL HEALTH CARE INCREASE

03:18:06.241 --> 03:18:08.309
ACCESS TO PROVIDERS AND AT

03:18:08.376 --> 03:18:09.744
LOWER COSTS FOR HEALTHCARE

03:18:09.811 --> 03:18:11.980
WE'RE SPECIFIC AREAS OF ACCESS

03:18:12.046 --> 03:18:14.816
AND AFFORDABILITY. THAT OUR

03:18:14.882 --> 03:18:17.752
CONCERNS FOR CALIFORNIANS. THE

03:18:17.819 --> 03:18:24.192
CLIPPERS. IN LIGHT WITH THE

03:18:24.259 --> 03:18:25.493
AFFORDABILITY THAT THAT MANY

03:18:25.560 --> 03:18:27.629
CALIFORNIA- EXPRESSING IT'S

03:18:27.695 --> 03:18:28.997
IMPORTANT TO THINKABOUT MAYBE

03:18:29.063 --> 03:18:30.765
THE COST PRESSURES THAT ARE

03:18:30.832 --> 03:18:32.667
BEING PLACED ON CALIFORNIANS

03:18:32.734 --> 03:18:34.135
FOR HEALTH CARE THESE ARE

03:18:34.202 --> 03:18:35.637
NUMBERS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO

03:18:35.703 --> 03:18:37.238
THOSE THEY WERE PRESENTED BY BY

03:18:37.305 --> 03:18:39.274
MANY THE PREVIOUS PANELISTS AND

03:18:39.340 --> 03:18:40.908
SO I THINK THERE'S A GROWING

03:18:40.975 --> 03:18:42.810
CONSENSUS AMONG RESEARCHERS

03:18:42.877 --> 03:18:43.778
THAT THE ISSUES AROUND

03:18:43.845 --> 03:18:47.081
AFFORDABILITY ARE IMPORTANT FOR

03:18:47.148 --> 03:18:47.548
POLICY MAKERS AND FOR

03:18:47.615 --> 03:18:50.351
CALIFORNIANS. IN CALIFORNIA THE

03:18:50.418 --> 03:18:51.819
AVERAGE EMPLOYER PLAN OR THE

03:18:51.886 --> 03:18:53.154
RIGHT AVERAGE PREMIUM RATHER

03:18:53.221 --> 03:18:55.089
FOR EMPLOYER SPONSORED PLAN. IS

03:18:55.156 --> 03:18:56.424
NOW OVER TWENTY THOUSAND

03:18:56.491 --> 03:18:59.927
DOLLARS WHICH AN INCREASE OF A

03:18:59.994 --> 03:19:02.697
133% SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWO.

03:19:02.764 --> 03:19:04.065
DEDUCTIBLES FOR CALIFORNIANS

03:19:04.132 --> 03:19:06.934
HAVE INCREASED OVER 210060% AND

03:19:07.001 --> 03:19:08.336
NOW THE TYPICAL DEDUCTIBLE FOR

03:19:08.403 --> 03:19:10.438
CALIFORNIA FAMILY PLANNING FOR

03:19:10.505 --> 03:19:11.572
THOSE WITH EMPLOYER SPONSORED

03:19:11.639 --> 03:19:13.274
INSURANCE IS OVER ONE THOUSAND

03:19:13.341 --> 03:19:16.244
SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. LOOKING

03:19:16.311 --> 03:19:17.512
AT THE CURRENT COVER CALIFORNIA

03:19:17.578 --> 03:19:19.180
MARKET FOR THOSE WHO RECEIVE

03:19:19.247 --> 03:19:20.515
INSURANCE THROUGH THE

03:19:20.581 --> 03:19:21.082
CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCE SINCE

03:19:21.149 --> 03:19:24.552
CHANGE. AVERAGE PREMIUMS NOW

03:19:24.619 --> 03:19:25.119
AVERAGE AROUND FIVE THOUSAND

03:19:25.186 --> 03:19:32.727
DOLLARS. THANKS I PLEASE. I

03:19:32.794 --> 03:19:34.395
THINK THIS IS THE SAME CHART

03:19:34.462 --> 03:19:35.763
WHAT WAS PRESENTED IN THE

03:19:35.830 --> 03:19:37.265
PROFESSOR BALLOTS PRESENTATION

03:19:37.332 --> 03:19:38.933
BUT THERE'S ALSO IT IN LIGHT OF

03:19:39.000 --> 03:19:41.102
THE GROWING COST A CONCERN THAT

03:19:41.169 --> 03:19:42.770
THAT WE ARE CENTRALLY PAYING

03:19:42.837 --> 03:19:44.339
FOR HEALTH CARE COSTS AND

03:19:44.405 --> 03:19:46.941
RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS AND

03:19:47.008 --> 03:19:47.442
WAGES AND OTHER TYPES OF

03:19:47.508 --> 03:19:49.477
BENEFITS. JUST AN EXAMPLE OF

03:19:49.544 --> 03:19:51.512
THIS THIS USES DATA FROM FROM A

03:19:51.579 --> 03:19:52.413
NATIONWIDE SURVEY OF EMPLOYER

03:19:52.480 --> 03:19:54.382
PLANS. AND IF WE LOOK AT THE

03:19:54.449 --> 03:19:56.250
AVERAGE COST GROWTH FOR

03:19:56.317 --> 03:19:58.453
EMPLOYERS. DEDUCTIBLES HAVE

03:19:58.519 --> 03:20:00.955
INCREASED BY A 162% OVER THE

03:20:01.022 --> 03:20:04.125
LAST DECADE AT THE SAME TIME

03:20:04.192 --> 03:20:05.660
PREMIUMS INCREASE INCREASE BY

03:20:05.727 --> 03:20:07.328
ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT. WHICH IS

03:20:07.395 --> 03:20:09.197
MUCH FASTER THAN WAGES AND AT

03:20:09.263 --> 03:20:10.765
AND IT JUST OVERALL GENERAL

03:20:10.832 --> 03:20:18.473
PUSH. THE CLIPPERS. TO HELP

03:20:18.539 --> 03:20:19.774
LOOK AT SOME OF THE ISSUES

03:20:19.841 --> 03:20:20.174
AROUND HEALTH CARE

03:20:20.241 --> 03:20:22.910
AFFORDABILITY. MY COLLEAGUES AT

03:20:22.977 --> 03:20:23.644
RAND AND I LOOKED AT THAT

03:20:23.711 --> 03:20:25.847
HOSPITAL PRICES AND HOW THEY

03:20:25.913 --> 03:20:27.849
VARY ACROSS THE COUNTRY. TO DO

03:20:27.915 --> 03:20:29.250
SO WE USED A LARGE COLLECTION

03:20:29.317 --> 03:20:30.551
OF INSURANCE DATA FROM BOTH

03:20:30.618 --> 03:20:33.121
EMPLOYER PLANS AND ALSO AIR ALL

03:20:33.187 --> 03:20:36.557
PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE IS. WHAT

03:20:36.624 --> 03:20:37.125
WE FOUND IS THAT ACROSS THE

03:20:37.191 --> 03:20:39.360
COUNTRY. EMPLOYERS IN AND

03:20:39.427 --> 03:20:40.728
PRIVATE INSURANCE PLAN TO

03:20:40.795 --> 03:20:42.597
PAYING PRICES THERE WERE ABOUT

03:20:42.663 --> 03:20:44.799
TWO HUNDRED AND 47% MEDICARE.

03:20:44.866 --> 03:20:46.033
IN CALIFORNIA THE PRICE WAS A

03:20:46.100 --> 03:20:48.369
LITTLE BIT HIGHER. THE RELATIVE

03:20:48.436 --> 03:20:50.271
TO MEDICARE THE AVERAGE PRICE

03:20:50.338 --> 03:20:51.239
FOR INSURANCE PLANS IN THE

03:20:51.305 --> 03:20:53.441
STATE WAS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND

03:20:53.508 --> 03:20:57.578
69% MEDICARE. SO CROSS THE

03:20:57.645 --> 03:21:01.115
BOARD CALIFORNIA. ROGEN'S PLANS

03:21:01.182 --> 03:21:02.617
AND INDIVIDUALS WITH INSURANCE

03:21:02.683 --> 03:21:04.018
COVERAGE IN CALIFORNIA ARE

03:21:04.085 --> 03:21:07.388
PAYING ABOUT TWICE WHAT

03:21:07.455 --> 03:21:08.022
MEDICARE WOULD PAY FOR HOSPITAL

03:21:08.089 --> 03:21:15.630
SERVICES. NEXT I PLEASE. WE

03:21:15.696 --> 03:21:16.931
ALSO LOOK TO BE RANGING

03:21:16.998 --> 03:21:19.934
HOSPITAL PRICES AND IT'S NOT SO

03:21:20.001 --> 03:21:21.469
WE FOUND THAT WHILE THE AVERAGE

03:21:21.536 --> 03:21:23.838
WAS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND 60%

03:21:23.905 --> 03:21:26.607
THE PRICE FOR HOSPICE SERVICES

03:21:26.674 --> 03:21:28.609
RANGE QUITE DRASTICALLY SO WE

03:21:28.676 --> 03:21:30.611
HAVE SOME HOSPITALS THE LOWER

03:21:30.678 --> 03:21:34.115
END THAT ARE PRICED AT ABOUT

03:21:34.182 --> 03:21:35.450
110060% MEDICARE. IN OTHER

03:21:35.516 --> 03:21:37.351
HOSPITALS THAT ARE OVER TWICE

03:21:37.418 --> 03:21:38.853
AS HIGH AND ABOVE 4100%

03:21:38.920 --> 03:21:41.823
MEDICARE. AND SO THE STORY OF A

03:21:41.889 --> 03:21:43.825
HOSPITAL PRICES IN CALIFORNIA

03:21:43.891 --> 03:21:45.293
IS NOT THAT THERE'S A SINGLE

03:21:45.359 --> 03:21:47.094
PRICE THAT'S HIGHER LOWER BUT

03:21:47.161 --> 03:21:49.263
RATHER THAT THERE'S A WIDE

03:21:49.330 --> 03:21:52.266
RANGE DISTRIBUTION OF PRICES.

03:21:52.333 --> 03:21:57.872
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AT THE SAME

03:21:57.939 --> 03:22:00.441
TIME WHILE PRICES VARY WIDELY

03:22:00.508 --> 03:22:02.677
QUALITY OF SERVERS AS WELL. AND

03:22:02.743 --> 03:22:03.911
ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE DID

03:22:03.978 --> 03:22:05.379
THE STUDY AND HOW ONE OF THE

03:22:05.446 --> 03:22:07.648
GOALS THAT WE HOPE EMPLOYERS

03:22:07.715 --> 03:22:08.883
POLICYMAKERS AND OTHERS WILL

03:22:08.950 --> 03:22:10.985
USE OF THE STATE UP IS ACTUALLY

03:22:11.052 --> 03:22:12.186
TO COMBINE INDIVIDUAL OVER

03:22:12.253 --> 03:22:15.056
PRICE DATA WITH WITH HOSPITALS-

03:22:15.122 --> 03:22:17.058
CHOIR OR QUALITY DATA RATHER.

03:22:17.124 --> 03:22:20.328
TO LOOK AT THE HIGH QUALITY AND

03:22:20.394 --> 03:22:22.263
LOW PRICE HOSPITALS WHICH YOU

03:22:22.330 --> 03:22:24.398
CAN THINK OF IN TERMS OF VALUE

03:22:24.465 --> 03:22:26.234
PERSPECTIVE REPRESENT THE HIGH

03:22:26.300 --> 03:22:28.503
VALUE HOSPITALS IN THE STATE OF

03:22:28.569 --> 03:22:30.171
CALIFORNIA. SO HERE THE THESE

03:22:30.238 --> 03:22:32.306
HOSPITALS ARE ARE HIGHLIGHTED

03:22:32.373 --> 03:22:34.141
AT THE BOTTOM CORNER IT BLEW.

03:22:34.208 --> 03:22:35.676
THE NEEDS OF THE HOSPITALS THAT

03:22:35.743 --> 03:22:38.279
HAVE BELOW AVERAGE PRICES. AND

03:22:38.346 --> 03:22:40.014
QUALITY THAT IS ABOVE AVERAGE

03:22:40.081 --> 03:22:42.750
FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS

03:22:42.817 --> 03:22:43.684
YOU CAN SEE THERE THERE ARE

03:22:43.751 --> 03:22:46.387
MANY WELL KNOWN HOSPITALS- THAT

03:22:46.454 --> 03:22:49.724
THAT WE'VE HIGHLIGHTED AND SO

03:22:49.790 --> 03:22:51.392
IT'S THERE THERE ARE HOSPITALS

03:22:51.459 --> 03:22:52.193
THAT ARE WELL KNOWN BECAUSE

03:22:52.260 --> 03:22:55.496
THIS TO CALIFORNIA. AND HELP OF

03:22:55.563 --> 03:22:57.865
LOW PRICES AND HIGH QUALITY.

03:22:57.932 --> 03:23:05.540
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AND WHEN WE

03:23:05.606 --> 03:23:08.809
LOOK A BIT DEEPER THE RANGE OF

03:23:08.876 --> 03:23:10.177
PRICES THAT THE VARIATION

03:23:10.244 --> 03:23:11.812
PRICES IN ACROSS THE STATE OF

03:23:11.879 --> 03:23:15.550
CALIFORNIA IS REALLY DRIVEN BY

03:23:15.616 --> 03:23:16.350
RELEASED WHAT ONE CONTRIBUTING

03:23:16.417 --> 03:23:18.419
FACTOR THAT WE NOTICE RIGHT

03:23:18.486 --> 03:23:19.921
AWAY IS THAT IF WE LOOK AT

03:23:19.987 --> 03:23:21.889
HOSPITAL PRICES THERE MANY

03:23:21.956 --> 03:23:23.958
HOSPITAL PRICES IN IN NORTHERN

03:23:24.025 --> 03:23:24.625
CALIFORNIA THAT TEND TO BE MORE

03:23:24.692 --> 03:23:27.962
EXPENSIVE. COMPARED TO

03:23:28.029 --> 03:23:28.429
HOSPITALS IN SOUTHERN

03:23:28.496 --> 03:23:30.765
CALIFORNIA. AND SO ACTUALLY IF

03:23:30.831 --> 03:23:32.733
WE IF WE LOOK AT OUR DATA. AND

03:23:32.800 --> 03:23:34.001
DISTINGUISHED USING BB

03:23:34.068 --> 03:23:35.436
AFFORDABLE- THAT THE COVER

03:23:35.503 --> 03:23:37.338
CALIFORNIA RATING AREAS. AND

03:23:37.405 --> 03:23:39.340
SPLIT THE OUR OUR SAMPLE IN

03:23:39.407 --> 03:23:41.676
USING SOME OTHER DATA LOOKING

03:23:41.742 --> 03:23:43.377
AT IT HOSPITAL RATING REGIONS.

03:23:43.444 --> 03:23:46.113
AND LOOK AT HOSPITALS IN

03:23:46.180 --> 03:23:46.614
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND

03:23:46.681 --> 03:23:48.683
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE FIND

03:23:48.749 --> 03:23:49.216
THAT HOSPITALS IN NORTHERN

03:23:49.283 --> 03:23:51.586
CALIFORNIA. ABOUT THIRTY

03:23:51.652 --> 03:23:52.887
THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE EXPENSIVE

03:23:52.954 --> 03:23:54.655
FOR INPATIENT MISSION. WHERE

03:23:54.722 --> 03:23:56.223
AVERAGE COST FOR NORTHERN

03:23:56.290 --> 03:23:57.858
CALIFORNIA INCREASED MISSION IS

03:23:57.925 --> 03:23:59.594
ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

03:23:59.660 --> 03:24:01.896
COMPARED ABOUT TWENTY THREE

03:24:01.963 --> 03:24:02.463
THOUSAND DOLLARS IN SOUTHERN

03:24:02.530 --> 03:24:06.033
CALIFORNIA. IF WE LOOK AT THE

03:24:06.100 --> 03:24:09.837
SAME PRICE RELATIVE TO MEDICARE

03:24:09.904 --> 03:24:11.906
FOR A HOSPITAL'S OVERALL. WE

03:24:11.973 --> 03:24:13.040
FIND THAT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

03:24:13.107 --> 03:24:15.142
HOSPITALS ARE ABOUT 23% MORE

03:24:15.209 --> 03:24:16.611
EXPENSIVE THAN OTHER CALIFORNIA

03:24:16.677 --> 03:24:20.381
HOSPITALS. AT 210080% MEDICARE-

03:24:20.448 --> 03:24:22.450
RELATIVE TO ABOUT 210030%

03:24:22.516 --> 03:24:26.921
MEDICARE. AND THEN IF WE USE

03:24:26.988 --> 03:24:28.923
OUR ADDITIONALLY A MARKET

03:24:28.990 --> 03:24:30.858
CONSTRUCTION MEASURES DEVELOPED

03:24:30.925 --> 03:24:32.627
BY BY FEDERAL AND STATE

03:24:32.693 --> 03:24:36.497
REGULATORS. TO THINK ABOUT

03:24:36.564 --> 03:24:38.633
WHAT'S A HEALTH. ARE OUR

03:24:38.699 --> 03:24:40.868
COMPETITORS. AS MEASURED BY

03:24:40.935 --> 03:24:43.104
BODY MEASUREMENT CALLED THE HER

03:24:43.170 --> 03:24:45.773
FOR DAHLE TO TRY WHERE A HIGHER

03:24:45.840 --> 03:24:48.509
IF YOU TRY TO DO INDICATES A

03:24:48.576 --> 03:24:49.543
LESS COMPETITIVE AND MORE COST

03:24:49.610 --> 03:24:51.646
FREE MARKET. IN THE LOWER

03:24:51.712 --> 03:24:53.681
EIGHTY CHINA INDICATES A- A

03:24:53.748 --> 03:24:55.983
MORE COMPETITIVE MARKET. WE

03:24:56.050 --> 03:24:57.318
FIND THAT POTENTIALLY A LT OF

03:24:57.385 --> 03:24:58.819
THE VARIATION THE REFINED OR

03:24:58.886 --> 03:24:59.754
DIFFERENCE OF PRICES RATHER

03:24:59.820 --> 03:25:01.255
GOOD FIGHT BETWEEN NORTHERN AND

03:25:01.322 --> 03:25:02.790
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. IS

03:25:02.857 --> 03:25:07.395
ACTUALLY EXPLAINED. BY BY

03:25:07.461 --> 03:25:08.062
DIFFERENCES IN MARKET STRUCTURE.

03:25:08.129 --> 03:25:09.397
SO NORTH CALIFORNIA WE FIND

03:25:09.463 --> 03:25:11.866
THAT THE HOSPITAL A TO TRY.

03:25:11.932 --> 03:25:14.168
THIS JUST UNDER THREE THOUSAND

03:25:14.235 --> 03:25:15.269
THE FTC AND DEPARTMENT OF

03:25:15.336 --> 03:25:17.972
JUSTICE CONSIDER IT A MARKET

03:25:18.039 --> 03:25:20.641
THAT IS VERY CONCENTRATED USING

03:25:20.708 --> 03:25:22.209
OTHER INDUSTRY DEFINITIONS AND

03:25:22.276 --> 03:25:24.278
OTHER INDUSTRIES AND IN A TO A

03:25:24.345 --> 03:25:25.513
TYPE OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE

03:25:25.579 --> 03:25:27.281
HUNDRED. AND SO APPLYING THAT

03:25:27.348 --> 03:25:29.250
SAME MARKET DEFINITION OR

03:25:29.316 --> 03:25:31.619
MARKET CONSTRUCTION MEASURE TO

03:25:31.686 --> 03:25:32.086
HOSPITALS IN NORTHERN

03:25:32.153 --> 03:25:34.488
CALIFORNIA SUGGESTED THE

03:25:34.555 --> 03:25:35.790
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL

03:25:35.856 --> 03:25:38.993
MARKET IS NOT COMPETITIVE-

03:25:39.060 --> 03:25:40.461
USING BEAUTY METRICS THAT HAVE

03:25:40.528 --> 03:25:43.397
BEEN APPLIED BY BY FEDERAL

03:25:43.464 --> 03:25:46.500
REGULATORS. IN CONTRAST THE

03:25:46.567 --> 03:25:49.236
EIGHTY GIANT CALIFORNIA IS

03:25:49.303 --> 03:25:50.905
ABOUT 60% OF BAD NORTHERN

03:25:50.971 --> 03:25:55.743
CALIFORNIA AT ABOUT. EIGHTEEN

03:25:55.810 --> 03:25:57.211
HUNDRED. AND IF WE LOOK AT IT

03:25:57.278 --> 03:25:59.346
PREMIUMS ON THE ACA. RECOVER

03:25:59.413 --> 03:26:01.482
CALIFORNIA RATHER OUR PREMIUMS

03:26:01.549 --> 03:26:05.019
IN IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FOR A

03:26:05.086 --> 03:26:06.454
SILVER THE SECOND MOST

03:26:06.520 --> 03:26:08.989
EXPENSIVE SILVER PLAN. FOR A

03:26:09.056 --> 03:26:10.725
FIFTY FIVE YEAR OLD. ARE ABOUT

03:26:10.791 --> 03:26:13.728
40% MORE EXPENSIVE IN NORTHERN

03:26:13.794 --> 03:26:14.228
CALIFORNIA VERSUS OTHER

03:26:14.295 --> 03:26:17.131
CALIFORNIA. ABOUT ONE POTENTIAL

03:26:17.198 --> 03:26:19.834
EXPLANATION IS THAT IT'S JUST

03:26:19.900 --> 03:26:21.368
CAUGHT MORE COSTLY TO DO

03:26:21.435 --> 03:26:22.937
BUSINESS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

03:26:23.003 --> 03:26:24.772
FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. OR

03:26:24.839 --> 03:26:27.441
POTENTIALLY- WAGES ARE HIRED IN

03:26:27.508 --> 03:26:28.409
NORTHERN VERSUS SOUTHERN

03:26:28.476 --> 03:26:30.578
CALIFORNIANS SO THEY COST MORE

03:26:30.644 --> 03:26:33.047
TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE BECAUSE

03:26:33.114 --> 03:26:33.614
YOU HAVE TO PAY DOCTORS AND

03:26:33.681 --> 03:26:35.282
NURSES MORE. BUT IF WE ACTUALLY

03:26:35.349 --> 03:26:35.916
LOOK AT JUST TO KIND OF METRICS

03:26:35.983 --> 03:26:38.519
OF JUST OVERALL MARKET

03:26:38.586 --> 03:26:40.087
DIFFERENCES OUTSIDE OF

03:26:40.154 --> 03:26:41.756
HEALTHCARE. WE ACTUALLY FIND IT

03:26:41.822 --> 03:26:44.525
THROUGH THE STORY MAY NOT BE

03:26:44.592 --> 03:26:45.092
EXPLAINED BY THOSE TYPES OF

03:26:45.159 --> 03:26:47.128
DIFFERENCES. SO FOR EXAMPLE IF

03:26:47.194 --> 03:26:49.063
WE LOOK AT OVERALL WAGES WAGES

03:26:49.130 --> 03:26:50.865
IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. ARE

03:26:50.931 --> 03:26:53.067
JUST 4% HIGHER THAN THAN IN

03:26:53.134 --> 03:26:55.503
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND IF WE

03:26:55.569 --> 03:26:58.439
LOOK AT HOUSING COSTS. WHICH WE

03:26:58.506 --> 03:26:59.006
MEASURED HERE TO THE AVERAGE

03:26:59.073 --> 03:27:01.008
HOME VALUE. HOUSING COSTS IN

03:27:01.075 --> 03:27:02.042
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ARE

03:27:02.109 --> 03:27:03.477
ACTUALLY LESS EXPENSIVE THAN IN

03:27:03.544 --> 03:27:05.112
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA INTO THIS

03:27:05.179 --> 03:27:05.946
MIGHT BE ONE POTENTIAL

03:27:06.013 --> 03:27:10.785
BAROMETER OF OUR COST OF LIVING.

03:27:10.851 --> 03:27:11.418
ANSWERS IS WE'RE WE'RE

03:27:11.485 --> 03:27:14.221
COMPARING PRICES AND MARKET

03:27:14.288 --> 03:27:15.656
STRUCTURE ACROSS CALIFORNIA.

03:27:15.723 --> 03:27:16.624
THERE ARE NOTICEABLE

03:27:16.690 --> 03:27:19.560
DIFFERENCES IN PRICES. BETWEEN

03:27:19.627 --> 03:27:20.027
NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN

03:27:20.094 --> 03:27:22.196
CALIFORNIA. THESE PRICES DON'T

03:27:22.263 --> 03:27:24.698
SEEM TO BE EXPLAINED BY

03:27:24.765 --> 03:27:26.667
DIFFERENCES IN JUST THE COST OF

03:27:26.734 --> 03:27:28.002
DOING BUSINESS IN NORTHERN

03:27:28.068 --> 03:27:29.970
VERSUS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. BUT

03:27:30.037 --> 03:27:31.639
THE STRUCTURE OF THE HOSPITAL

03:27:31.705 --> 03:27:33.574
INDUSTRY IN HOSPITAL MARKETS

03:27:33.641 --> 03:27:35.442
ARE DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT

03:27:35.509 --> 03:27:36.043
BETWEEN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN

03:27:36.110 --> 03:27:47.521
CALIFORNIA. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.

03:27:47.588 --> 03:27:49.323
M. IN A RELATED STUDY

03:27:49.390 --> 03:27:50.591
COLLEAGUES AT THE UNIVERSITY

03:27:50.658 --> 03:27:52.493
CALIFORNIA BERKELEY AND I HAVE

03:27:52.560 --> 03:27:54.595
LOOKED AT THAT THE STRUCTURE OF

03:27:54.662 --> 03:27:57.932
MARKETS ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND

03:27:57.998 --> 03:27:58.499
HOW THEY'VE EVOLVED OVER THE

03:27:58.566 --> 03:28:00.401
LAST COUPLE YEARS. WE DID THIS

03:28:00.467 --> 03:28:03.003
STUDY IS WE CREATED AN INDEX OF

03:28:03.070 --> 03:28:05.005
HOSPITAL MARKET CONCENTRATION

03:28:05.072 --> 03:28:07.074
HERE SCALE GOES FROM ZERO SO

03:28:07.141 --> 03:28:08.709
THAT THE COMPETITIVE MARKET.

03:28:08.776 --> 03:28:10.978
WITH WHAT THE COMPETITION. TO

03:28:11.045 --> 03:28:12.847
OUR HIGHEST MEASURE OF SIX

03:28:12.913 --> 03:28:15.082
WHICH IS A MANAGER MARKET WITH

03:28:15.149 --> 03:28:18.586
LITTLE COMPETITION AND LOTS OF

03:28:18.652 --> 03:28:20.688
VERTIGO CONCENTRATED MARKET.

03:28:20.754 --> 03:28:22.723
WHAT WE FIND IS THAT OVERALL

03:28:22.790 --> 03:28:24.758
BETWEEN THE TWO THOUSAND TEN TO

03:28:24.825 --> 03:28:26.227
TWENTY SIXTEEN PERIOD. MARKETS

03:28:26.293 --> 03:28:29.263
AND IN CALIFORNIA DID BECOME

03:28:29.330 --> 03:28:33.901
MORE CONCENTRATED. HOWEVER THE

03:28:33.968 --> 03:28:35.469
CONCENTRATION OF THE LARGEST

03:28:35.536 --> 03:28:37.438
GROWTH MARKET CONCENTRATION

03:28:37.504 --> 03:28:38.005
REALLY OCCURRED IN NORTHERN

03:28:38.072 --> 03:28:40.674
CALIFORNIA. IN A PARTICULAR IN

03:28:40.741 --> 03:28:41.909
IN THE FAR KIND OF REACHES

03:28:41.976 --> 03:28:45.112
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND ALSO IN

03:28:45.179 --> 03:28:49.183
IN THE SIERRA FOOTHILLS. AND SO

03:28:49.250 --> 03:28:51.886
WHAT WE ARE. HAPPY TALKED ABOUT

03:28:51.952 --> 03:28:53.787
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PRICES IN

03:28:53.854 --> 03:28:55.322
OTHER MARKETS STRUCTURE IN

03:28:55.389 --> 03:28:56.056
NORTHERN VERSUS SOUTHERN

03:28:56.123 --> 03:28:57.892
CALIFORNIA THIS CHART

03:28:57.958 --> 03:28:58.859
ILLUSTRATES WHERE A LOT ABOUT

03:28:58.926 --> 03:29:00.895
CHANGING MARKET CONCENTRATION

03:29:00.961 --> 03:29:02.730
IS ACTUALLY OCCURRING. NEXT

03:29:02.796 --> 03:29:10.104
SLIDE PLEASE. ANOTHER RECENT

03:29:10.170 --> 03:29:11.839
TREND THAT IS ALSO HAPPENING IN

03:29:11.906 --> 03:29:14.108
CALIFORNIA IS ALSO THE IS THAT

03:29:14.174 --> 03:29:16.343
THE TREND OF VERTICAL

03:29:16.410 --> 03:29:18.078
INTEGRATION WHERE PHYSICIANS

03:29:18.145 --> 03:29:20.614
ARE EMPLOYED BY HOSPITALS OR

03:29:20.681 --> 03:29:22.783
HEALTH SYSTEMS KATE TOUCHED ON

03:29:22.850 --> 03:29:24.151
SOME OF THE AFFECTS OF VERTICAL

03:29:24.218 --> 03:29:25.886
INTEGRATION BUT HERE I JUST

03:29:25.953 --> 03:29:27.821
WANT TO ILLUSTRATE WHAT'S

03:29:27.888 --> 03:29:30.190
HAPPENING IN TERMS OF THE RISE

03:29:30.257 --> 03:29:32.159
IN BROOKLYN GRATION. IN

03:29:32.226 --> 03:29:34.595
CALIFORNIA. IN THE SAME STUDY

03:29:34.662 --> 03:29:36.697
THAT THAT HIGHLIGHTED EARLIER.

03:29:36.764 --> 03:29:38.198
WE DOCUMENTED TRANS IN VERTICAL

03:29:38.265 --> 03:29:39.166
INTEGRATION OF CALIFORNIA

03:29:39.233 --> 03:29:41.568
PHYSICIANS USING DATA ON BOTH

03:29:41.635 --> 03:29:43.370
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS WHICH

03:29:43.437 --> 03:29:46.206
IS- INDICATED BLUE HERE.

03:29:46.273 --> 03:29:47.474
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS

03:29:47.541 --> 03:29:51.745
INCREASED FROM ABOUT- 26% OF

03:29:51.812 --> 03:29:52.780
PHYSICIANS BEING VERTICALLY

03:29:52.846 --> 03:29:55.416
INTEGRATED TO JUST UNDER 40% IN

03:29:55.482 --> 03:29:57.618
IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. FOR

03:29:57.685 --> 03:29:59.820
SPECIALIST POSITIONS INDICATED

03:29:59.887 --> 03:30:02.122
READ THE GROWTH WAS PRETTY RUDE

03:30:02.189 --> 03:30:03.624
TO THIS MUCH MORE DRAMATIC

03:30:03.691 --> 03:30:07.728
INCREASING FROM ABOUT 20% IN

03:30:07.795 --> 03:30:10.497
2010254% IN TWENTY SIXTEEN.

03:30:10.564 --> 03:30:12.166
SEVEN ADDITION TO CHANGING

03:30:12.232 --> 03:30:14.435
MARKET STRUCTURE MORE AND MORE

03:30:14.501 --> 03:30:16.203
PHYSICIANS ARE NOW POISED BY A

03:30:16.270 --> 03:30:18.839
HOSPITAL OR HEALTH SYSTEM AND

03:30:18.906 --> 03:30:19.406
THERE ARE FEWER INDEPENDENT

03:30:19.473 --> 03:30:21.875
PHYSICIANS. A LOT OF- A DOCTOR

03:30:21.942 --> 03:30:23.277
UNDER FROM COLLEAGUES WORK

03:30:23.344 --> 03:30:24.812
SUGGESTS THAT THEY'RE BOTH

03:30:24.878 --> 03:30:26.847
PRICE COMPETITION AND QUALITY

03:30:26.914 --> 03:30:28.916
EFFECTS OF VERTICAL INTEGRATION

03:30:28.983 --> 03:30:30.117
INTO THIS TYPE OF TREND IS

03:30:30.184 --> 03:30:31.952
SOMETHING THAT. THAT REGULATORS

03:30:32.019 --> 03:30:33.320
IN CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE AWARE

03:30:33.387 --> 03:30:45.966
OF. EXIDE THE BILL. MOST OF OUR

03:30:46.033 --> 03:30:46.967
WOULD HAVE TALKED ABOUT TODAY

03:30:47.034 --> 03:30:48.202
WERE ALL OVER TALK ABOUT THE

03:30:48.268 --> 03:30:50.037
RATHER HAS FOCUSED ON ON

03:30:50.104 --> 03:30:51.538
HOSPITAL COSTS BUT I THINK IT'S

03:30:51.605 --> 03:30:53.073
ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOWLEDGE

03:30:53.140 --> 03:30:55.175
THAT PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS

03:30:55.242 --> 03:30:55.776
ACCOUNT FOR GROWING SHARE OF

03:30:55.843 --> 03:30:58.479
SPENDING. IF WE LOOK ACROSS THE

03:30:58.545 --> 03:31:00.080
LAST THREE YEARS PRESCRIPTION

03:31:00.147 --> 03:31:01.648
DRUG COSTS ACTUALLY SHOW THAT

03:31:01.715 --> 03:31:02.616
THE LARGEST INCREASE IN

03:31:02.683 --> 03:31:04.351
SPENDING AND NOW COUNT FOR

03:31:04.418 --> 03:31:06.854
ABOUT 21% OF HEALTHCARE COSTS

03:31:06.920 --> 03:31:09.456
IN CALIFORNIA. NEXT SLIDE

03:31:09.523 --> 03:31:17.564
PLEASE. ADDITIONALLY ANOTHER

03:31:17.631 --> 03:31:19.299
POLICY CONCERN FOR MANY

03:31:19.366 --> 03:31:21.402
CALIFORNIA'S OUT OF NETWORK

03:31:21.468 --> 03:31:23.303
BILLS WERE SURPRISED BILLS. IN

03:31:23.370 --> 03:31:24.338
A SURVEY CONDUCTED BY THE

03:31:24.405 --> 03:31:26.373
KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION ABOUT

03:31:26.440 --> 03:31:27.975
A THIRD OF CALIFORNIA'S

03:31:28.042 --> 03:31:29.743
REPORTED THEY HAD RECEIVED AN

03:31:29.810 --> 03:31:32.279
UNEXPECTED OR A SURPRISE BILL

03:31:32.346 --> 03:31:34.048
IN THE LAST YEAR. UNEXPECTED

03:31:34.114 --> 03:31:36.350
AND SURPRISE BILLS- THAT THAT

03:31:36.417 --> 03:31:37.618
HAPPENED WITH WIND A PATIENT

03:31:37.684 --> 03:31:38.552
GOES OUT OF NETWORK FOR A

03:31:38.619 --> 03:31:40.421
SERVICE WHERE THEY THEY ARE NOT

03:31:40.487 --> 03:31:42.723
ANTICIPATING. RECEIVING OUT OF

03:31:42.790 --> 03:31:43.957
NETWORK BILLING BELIEVE THAT

03:31:44.024 --> 03:31:45.793
EVERYTHING IS IN NETWORK. OR

03:31:45.859 --> 03:31:47.194
BOTH SOMETHING THAT BECAUSE

03:31:47.261 --> 03:31:48.862
LOTS OF DISTRESS TO PATIENTS

03:31:48.929 --> 03:31:50.164
WITH IT IN ADDITION OR

03:31:50.230 --> 03:31:51.398
SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN ALSO

03:31:51.465 --> 03:31:54.001
LEAD TO HIGHER PRICES FOR IN

03:31:54.068 --> 03:32:04.945
NETWORK CARE. NEXT I PLEASE.

03:32:05.012 --> 03:32:05.712
FINALLY WHO WOULD HAVE

03:32:05.779 --> 03:32:07.114
DISCUSSED SO FAR HAS REALLY

03:32:07.181 --> 03:32:08.482
FOCUSED ON ON THE POPULATION

03:32:08.549 --> 03:32:09.850
THAT RECEIVES INSURANCE THIRD

03:32:09.917 --> 03:32:11.852
EMPLOYER OTHER TYPES OF PRIVATE

03:32:11.919 --> 03:32:13.454
INSURANCE INCLUDING THROUGH

03:32:13.520 --> 03:32:14.721
COVERED CALIFORNIA. IT'S

03:32:14.788 --> 03:32:15.856
IMPORTANT TO ALSO RECOGNIZE

03:32:15.923 --> 03:32:17.291
THAT THERE MANY PATIENTS WHO

03:32:17.357 --> 03:32:19.293
WHO RECEIVE CARE OUTSIDE OF THE

03:32:19.359 --> 03:32:19.993
EMPLOYER SPONSORED OR PRIVATE

03:32:20.060 --> 03:32:22.463
INSURANCE SYSTEM. IN PARTICULAR

03:32:22.529 --> 03:32:24.631
THERE THERE ARE ABOUT A HUNDRED

03:32:24.698 --> 03:32:26.033
SEVENTY FIVE FEDERAL QUALIFIED

03:32:26.100 --> 03:32:26.600
HEALTH CARE CENTERS IN THE

03:32:26.667 --> 03:32:28.635
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO PROVIDE

03:32:28.702 --> 03:32:30.137
CARE FOR OVER FOUR MILLION

03:32:30.204 --> 03:32:32.005
CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE

03:32:32.072 --> 03:32:35.542
PREDOMINANTLY LOW INCOME. IN

03:32:35.609 --> 03:32:37.044
ADDITION THERE ARE THIRTY SIX

03:32:37.111 --> 03:32:39.046
CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITALS. THAT

03:32:39.113 --> 03:32:40.814
PROVIDE CARE FOR RURAL

03:32:40.881 --> 03:32:43.217
CALIFORNIANS. AND CALIFORNIA IS

03:32:43.283 --> 03:32:44.985
ALSO HOME TO OVER TEN MILLION

03:32:45.052 --> 03:32:47.754
MEDICAID ENROLLEES AND- ALMOST

03:32:47.821 --> 03:32:48.455
THREE MILLION PEOPLE WITHOUT

03:32:48.522 --> 03:32:50.157
INSURANCE. AND THOSE WERE

03:32:50.224 --> 03:32:51.592
THINKING ABOUT POLICIES TO

03:32:51.658 --> 03:32:53.627
ADDRESS THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM

03:32:53.694 --> 03:32:54.862
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO

03:32:54.928 --> 03:32:56.897
KNOWLEDGE THAT THE PRICE ISSUES

03:32:56.964 --> 03:32:58.999
THAT THE MARKET COMPETITION

03:32:59.066 --> 03:33:00.467
ISSUES THAT HIGHLIGHTED EARLIER.

03:33:00.534 --> 03:33:01.535
EMILY TARGET TO PRIVATELY

03:33:01.602 --> 03:33:03.337
INSURED POPULATION AND THEIR

03:33:03.403 --> 03:33:06.340
OTHER POPULATIONS WHERE WE NEED

03:33:06.406 --> 03:33:06.874
TO ENSURE WE HAVE ADEQUATE

03:33:06.940 --> 03:33:16.383
ACCESS TO CARE. NEXT I PLEASE.

03:33:16.450 --> 03:33:18.051
AND SO THAT THAT'S KIND OF THE

03:33:18.118 --> 03:33:20.888
LANDSCAPE POLICE AS I SEE THE

03:33:20.954 --> 03:33:22.923
PRIMARY ISSUES AFFORDABILITY

03:33:22.990 --> 03:33:24.424
CALIFORNIA. AND AS WE'RE

03:33:24.491 --> 03:33:26.059
THINKING ABOUT POLICIES TO

03:33:26.126 --> 03:33:28.228
ADDRESS AFFORDABILITY AND TO

03:33:28.295 --> 03:33:30.297
ENSURE ACCESS TO AFFORDABILITY

03:33:30.364 --> 03:33:32.032
I THINK THAT THE LEAST THE WAY

03:33:32.099 --> 03:33:33.901
I THINK OF IT IS THROUGH THERE

03:33:33.967 --> 03:33:35.002
IS A CONTINUUM OF POLICY

03:33:35.068 --> 03:33:37.671
OPTIONS. WITH INCREASING

03:33:37.738 --> 03:33:39.873
EFFORTS AND INCREASING

03:33:39.940 --> 03:33:41.241
CHALLENGES TO IMPLEMENTING ITS

03:33:41.308 --> 03:33:43.277
POLICY BUT THE SAME TIME

03:33:43.343 --> 03:33:45.546
INCREASING REWARDS. AND SO IT

03:33:45.612 --> 03:33:48.081
JUST EXAMPLE- CALIFORNIA HAS

03:33:48.148 --> 03:33:50.984
MADE GREAT STRIDES RECENTLY TO

03:33:51.051 --> 03:33:53.120
ADOPT PRICE TRANSPARENCY. AD I

03:33:53.187 --> 03:33:54.955
THINK THIS IS A POLICY OPTION

03:33:55.022 --> 03:33:59.059
THAT CAN. BE TO FURTHER CHANGES

03:33:59.126 --> 03:34:00.427
BUT WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC

03:34:00.494 --> 03:34:01.562
THAT PRICE TRANSPARENCY BY

03:34:01.628 --> 03:34:03.197
ITSELF ISN'T SOMETHING THAT'S

03:34:03.263 --> 03:34:06.600
GOING TO WHOLESALE CHANGE THAT

03:34:06.667 --> 03:34:08.569
THE MARKET CALIFORNIA. GIVEN

03:34:08.635 --> 03:34:09.469
THE EFFORT THAT THE

03:34:09.536 --> 03:34:11.238
CALIFORNIA'S INVESTED IN IN

03:34:11.305 --> 03:34:13.207
PROMOTING PRICE TRANSPARENCY I

03:34:13.273 --> 03:34:14.541
THINK THERE ARE WAYS TO THINK

03:34:14.608 --> 03:34:15.809
ABOUT LEVERAGING A LOT OF THAT

03:34:15.876 --> 03:34:19.479
WORK TO BUILD ON ON ON PRICE

03:34:19.546 --> 03:34:19.980
TRANSPARENCY FOR FURTHER

03:34:20.047 --> 03:34:22.816
POLICIES. SO FOR EXAMPLE MANY

03:34:22.883 --> 03:34:25.018
EMPLOYERS IN CALIFORNIA I AM

03:34:25.085 --> 03:34:26.186
GONNA HIGHLIGHT SOME SPECIFIC

03:34:26.253 --> 03:34:28.055
SPECIFIC EXAMPLES ARE REALLY

03:34:28.121 --> 03:34:29.656
DOING REALLY INNOVATIVE WORK

03:34:29.723 --> 03:34:30.591
AROUND INSURANCE BENEFIT

03:34:30.657 --> 03:34:32.092
DESIGN. WHERE THEY'RE USING

03:34:32.159 --> 03:34:33.994
PRICE TRANSPARENCY INFORMATION

03:34:34.061 --> 03:34:36.630
TO INFORM HOW THE STRATEGICALLY

03:34:36.697 --> 03:34:39.233
SET BENEFITS FOR THE WORKERS.

03:34:39.299 --> 03:34:40.667
AND THEN FINALLY FOR THINKING

03:34:40.734 --> 03:34:42.202
ABOUT ADDRESSING MARKET

03:34:42.269 --> 03:34:43.770
COMPETITION AND ADDRESSING

03:34:43.837 --> 03:34:45.906
PRICES FOR FROM MORE OF A

03:34:45.973 --> 03:34:46.907
REGULATORY STANDPOINT THAT'S

03:34:46.974 --> 03:34:48.675
SOMETHING THAT CAN BUILD ON ON

03:34:48.742 --> 03:34:50.644
ON PRICE TRANSPARENCY. BUT IT

03:34:50.711 --> 03:34:51.979
MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT

03:34:52.045 --> 03:34:54.481
REQUIRES MORE EFFORT FOR BRENDA

03:34:54.548 --> 03:34:56.650
LATERS AND POLICY MAKERS BUT IT

03:34:56.717 --> 03:34:57.584
MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT COULD

03:34:57.651 --> 03:34:59.620
HAVE A BROADER IMPACT ON

03:34:59.686 --> 03:35:02.089
AFFORDABILITY FOR CALIFORNIANS.

03:35:02.155 --> 03:35:15.869
NEXT I PLEASE. IT TOO IF WE

03:35:15.936 --> 03:35:16.937
THINK ABOUT WAYS TO ADDRESS

03:35:17.004 --> 03:35:19.640
PRICE TRANSPARENCY I THINK THE

03:35:19.706 --> 03:35:20.774
ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE THAT

03:35:20.841 --> 03:35:22.276
THE MY COLLEAGUE CHERYL DEBRA

03:35:22.342 --> 03:35:23.877
MENTIONED IS A REALLY GREAT

03:35:23.944 --> 03:35:25.779
START FOR CALIFORNIA AND AN

03:35:25.846 --> 03:35:28.615
EXCELLENT WAY TO PROMOTE PRICE

03:35:28.682 --> 03:35:30.217
TRANSPARENCY. ONE OF THE

03:35:30.284 --> 03:35:31.418
CHALLENGES OF PRICE

03:35:31.485 --> 03:35:33.520
TRANSPARENCY NOT JUST IN

03:35:33.587 --> 03:35:35.489
CALIFORNIA BUT IN IN EVERY

03:35:35.555 --> 03:35:37.190
OTHER STATE IS THAT THE THROUGH

03:35:37.257 --> 03:35:38.258
THE RECENT SUPREME COURT

03:35:38.325 --> 03:35:40.427
DECISION TWENTY FOURTEEN. OF

03:35:40.494 --> 03:35:41.361
KOBE VERSES OF THE METRIC

03:35:41.428 --> 03:35:43.930
MUTUAL LIMITS THE ABILITY OF

03:35:43.997 --> 03:35:45.699
CALVET OR IF OF STATE UP HERE

03:35:45.766 --> 03:35:47.901
CLAIMS DATABASES. TO COLLECT

03:35:47.968 --> 03:35:49.703
DATA FROM FROM SELF FUNDED

03:35:49.770 --> 03:35:51.371
INSURANCE PLANS WHICH PRIMARILY

03:35:51.438 --> 03:35:53.307
COVER THE LARGE GROUP INSURANCE

03:35:53.373 --> 03:35:56.443
MARKET THAT'S REGULATED THROUGH

03:35:56.510 --> 03:35:56.943
ARRESTED BY THE FEDERAL

03:35:57.010 --> 03:36:01.014
GOVERNMENT. THIS IS A KEY. A

03:36:01.081 --> 03:36:03.550
SHORTCOMING OF MANY ARE ALL

03:36:03.617 --> 03:36:05.452
PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE IS. WHAT

03:36:05.519 --> 03:36:07.988
POTENTIAL OPTIONS WERE THESE

03:36:08.055 --> 03:36:09.189
POLICY THAT THE CALIFORNIA

03:36:09.256 --> 03:36:10.991
COULD COULD EXPLORE AND HAS

03:36:11.058 --> 03:36:13.160
BEEN- DISCUSSED IN OTHER STATES

03:36:13.226 --> 03:36:15.595
IS TYING A PARTICIPATION OTHER

EXAMPLE. THE STATE OF

03:36:24.371 --> 03:36:25.806
CALIFORNIA COULD THINK ABOUT

03:36:25.872 --> 03:36:28.175
WAYS TO REQUIRE THAT FIRMS WHO

03:36:28.241 --> 03:36:29.810
WHO OFFERED INSURANCE THROUGH

HEALTH PLAN DATA. AND THAT'S A

03:36:54.735 --> 03:36:56.770
POTENTIAL POLICY THAT THE

03:36:56.837 --> 03:36:57.337
CALIFORNIA COULD CONSIDER AS

03:36:57.404 --> 03:37:06.246
WELL. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THIS

03:37:06.313 --> 03:37:08.181
IS EXAMPLE OF HOW HOW

03:37:08.248 --> 03:37:10.317
CALIFORNIA PUBLIC PURCHASERS

03:37:10.384 --> 03:37:11.651
HAVE ABUSED DRUG PRICE

03:37:11.718 --> 03:37:13.453
TRANSPARENCY I THINK REALLY

03:37:13.520 --> 03:37:15.055
COME FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC

03:37:15.122 --> 03:37:16.857
EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEM OR

03:37:16.923 --> 03:37:18.892
CALPERS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

03:37:18.959 --> 03:37:21.228
THE CALPERS NOTICE SEVERAL

03:37:21.294 --> 03:37:24.498
YEARS AGO THAT PRICES FOR MANY

03:37:24.564 --> 03:37:25.265
COMMON SERVICES VARY PRETTY

03:37:25.332 --> 03:37:27.634
WIDELY. THE CALPERS THAT HAVE

03:37:27.701 --> 03:37:28.969
ACCESS TO AN ALL PAYER CLAIMS

03:37:29.035 --> 03:37:32.005
DATABASE BUT IS DEVELOPED OVER-THE LAST OF YEARS A PRETTY

03:37:32.072 --> 03:37:33.607
SOPHISTICATED APPROACH FOR

03:37:33.673 --> 03:37:36.777
THINKING ABOUT PRICES WITHIN

03:37:36.843 --> 03:37:37.277
THEIR THEIR OWN EMPLOYEE

03:37:37.344 --> 03:37:39.246
POPULATION. JUST EXAMPLES OF

03:37:39.312 --> 03:37:40.814
THE PRICE RANGE THAT THE

03:37:40.881 --> 03:37:42.649
CALPERS FACED THIS SLIDE SHOWS

03:37:42.716 --> 03:37:46.219
THE RANGE IN PRICES FOR COST

03:37:46.286 --> 03:37:48.288
PLEASE ON THE LEFT. ONE OF

03:37:48.355 --> 03:37:48.789
THINGS THAT THE CALPERS

03:37:48.855 --> 03:37:51.491
NOTICED. THAT PRICES FOR CORNOS

03:37:51.558 --> 03:37:54.261
BEES LIKE MANY OTHER SERVICES

03:37:54.327 --> 03:37:56.363
RANGE PRETTY DRASTICALLY SO

03:37:56.430 --> 03:37:58.632
HERE PRICES RANGE FROM A LOW OF

03:37:58.698 --> 03:38:01.802
ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. ALL

03:38:01.868 --> 03:38:02.335
THE WAY UP TO TEN THOUSAND

03:38:02.402 --> 03:38:05.572
DOLLARS. THE OTHER THING THAT

03:38:05.639 --> 03:38:07.707
CALPERS NOTICED. IS THAT THERE

IMPLEMENTATION THE PROGRAM

03:39:15.609 --> 03:39:18.879
CALPERS THE REDLINE RELATIVE TO

03:39:18.945 --> 03:39:19.880
COMPARISON GROUP RATHER

03:39:19.946 --> 03:39:22.249
CALIFORNIA PURCHASERS THE BLUE

PROGRAMS LEVERAGE OF PRICE

03:39:25.252 --> 03:39:27.354
TRANSPARENCY. WHICH IS SIMILAR

03:39:27.420 --> 03:39:28.188
TO THE DATA BEING COLLECTED

03:39:28.255 --> 03:39:29.189

ENCOURAGE THE USE OF LOWER

PRICE PROVIDERS. THE CLIPPERS.

03:39:45.038 --> 03:39:46.273
AND SO IS THE STATE OF

03:39:46.339 --> 03:39:49.643
CALIFORNIA IS THINKING IT ABOUT

03:39:49.709 --> 03:39:51.478
LEVERAGING SOME OF THE

03:39:51.545 --> 03:39:52.078
INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH

03:39:52.145 --> 03:39:53.847
PRICE TRANSPARENCY I THINK

03:39:53.914 --> 03:39:56.216
THERE'S AN IMPORTANT ROLE- THAT

03:39:56.283 --> 03:39:58.084
THE CALIFORNIA CAN CONSIDER IN

03:39:58.151 --> 03:40:00.020
TERMS OF PROMOTING SOME OF THE

03:40:00.086 --> 03:40:02.155
WORK THAT THE CALPERS IS DONE.

03:40:02.222 --> 03:40:03.790
FROM MY VIEWPOINT CALPERS IS

03:40:03.857 --> 03:40:05.125
ONE OF THE MOST INNOVATIVE

03:40:05.191 --> 03:40:06.826
PURCHASERS OF HEALTH CARE

03:40:06.893 --> 03:40:08.662
SERVICES THE UNITED STATES.

03:40:08.728 --> 03:40:10.664
THEY'VE PIONEERED PROGRAMS SUCH

03:40:10.730 --> 03:40:19.339
AS REFERENCE PRICING AND MORRIS.

03:40:19.406 --> 03:40:20.473
AND THEY'VE ADDRESSED PRIVATE

03:40:20.540 --> 03:40:21.741
POLICIES TO ADDRESS PRICE

03:40:21.808 --> 03:40:23.243
VARIATION OF HIGH PRICES FOR A

03:40:23.310 --> 03:40:24.911
VARIETY OF SERVICES INCLUDING

03:40:24.978 --> 03:40:26.913
OUTPATIENT SERVICES INPATIENT

03:40:26.980 --> 03:40:31.851
SERVICES. AND ALSO

03:40:31.918 --> 03:40:32.485
PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES. AND SO

03:40:32.552 --> 03:40:34.287
I THINK A TERM AMOUNT OF. FOR

03:40:34.354 --> 03:40:35.822
THE STATE OF TO HIRE SOME OF

03:40:35.889 --> 03:40:37.624
THE WORKERS IS DOING TO

03:40:37.691 --> 03:40:39.759
IMPLEMENT INNOVATIVE BENEFITS.

03:40:39.826 --> 03:40:41.628
AND TO POTENTIALLY ALLOW OTHER

03:40:41.695 --> 03:40:43.263
EMPLOYERS TO LEARN FROM SOME OF

03:40:43.330 --> 03:40:45.865
THE WORK CALPERS IS DOING AND

03:40:45.932 --> 03:40:46.433
IN SOME SENSE ADOPTED BEING

03:40:46.499 --> 03:40:51.304
DONE IN THEIR OWN BACKYARD.

03:40:51.371 --> 03:41:01.348
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THE CLUB IS.

03:41:01.414 --> 03:41:03.416
AND SO IT IS WERE AWESOME THINK

03:41:03.483 --> 03:41:09.189
ABOUT PREVIOUS LIKELY. AT OTHER

03:41:09.255 --> 03:41:13.560
POLICIES. I THINK IT'S A PER TO

03:41:13.627 --> 03:41:16.529
THINK TO KEEP IN MY- JUST THE

03:41:16.596 --> 03:41:18.798
ROLE OF ENSURE ACT TO. MARKET

03:41:18.865 --> 03:41:23.570
TO GET. AND WE CAN'T.

03:41:23.637 --> 03:41:25.071
AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. IF

03:41:25.138 --> 03:41:28.341
PROVIDE MARKETS ARE NOT. AND IF

03:41:28.408 --> 03:41:29.409
PATIENTS TO HAVE AND TO LOWER

03:41:29.476 --> 03:41:33.546
COST PER. AS I HIGHLIGHTED.

03:41:33.613 --> 03:41:34.914
THERE MAY NORTH CALIFORNIA

03:41:34.981 --> 03:41:36.783
MARKET. WHERE THE HEALTH TO

03:41:36.850 --> 03:41:37.617
SYSTEM FRANKLY IS NOT

03:41:37.684 --> 03:41:40.220
COMPETITIVE. AND SO THERE MAY

03:41:40.286 --> 03:41:42.555
NEED TO BE OVERSIGHT OF MARKETS

03:41:42.622 --> 03:41:45.558
OR POLICIES THAT THE PLATE PUT

03:41:45.625 --> 03:41:47.060
IN PLACE PRICE LIMITS FOR

03:41:47.127 --> 03:41:49.162
MARKETS THAT BUT FRANKLY ARE

03:41:49.229 --> 03:41:51.931
NOT COMPETITIVE. SECOND WE KNOW

03:41:51.998 --> 03:41:54.434
THAT CONSOLIDATION IS DRIVEN BY

03:41:54.501 --> 03:41:56.770
BY PRICING DIFFERENTIALS. AND

03:41:56.836 --> 03:41:57.971
SO REGULATORS MAY WANT TO

03:41:58.038 --> 03:41:59.739
CONSIDER SOME OF THESE

03:41:59.806 --> 03:42:01.074
UNDERLYING PRICE DIFFERENCES

03:42:01.141 --> 03:42:03.276
THAT PROVIDE THE- THE

03:42:03.343 --> 03:42:05.645
GROUNDWORK FOR CONSOLIDATION

03:42:05.712 --> 03:42:06.913
AND PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR

03:42:06.980 --> 03:42:08.715
CONSOLIDATION THAT WE SEE

03:42:08.782 --> 03:42:12.619
HAPPENING CALIFORNIA. ONE ONE

03:42:12.686 --> 03:42:13.319
POTENTIAL EXAMPLE WOULD BE TO

03:42:13.386 --> 03:42:15.355
THINK ABOUT POLICIES THAT LIMIT

03:42:15.422 --> 03:42:16.923
FACILITY FEES FOR SERVICES THAT

03:42:16.990 --> 03:42:19.793
DON'T HAPPEN IN IN- FACILITY

03:42:19.859 --> 03:42:21.227
SERVICES ARE HAPPENING NON

03:42:21.294 --> 03:42:24.264
FACILITY AS A SET OF CARE. THIS

03:42:24.330 --> 03:42:33.573
IS A SYSTEM OR A OF PRICING MAR

03:42:33.640 --> 03:42:35.542
THAT SCRIPT OFTEN INTEGRATION

03:42:35.608 --> 03:42:38.278
FOR BECAUSE- AND ABOUT WAYS TO

03:42:38.344 --> 03:42:42.182
ADDRESS THAT DR OF INTEGRATION.

03:42:42.248 --> 03:42:42.949
MORE DIRECTLY BE SOME THAT

03:42:43.016 --> 03:42:45.351
MIGHT A POTENTIAL. REDUCING THE

03:42:45.418 --> 03:42:50.356
OF FOR INTEGRATION. AND THEN

03:42:50.423 --> 03:42:51.791
FOR I ABOUT I OF NETWORK

03:42:51.858 --> 03:42:54.294
EARLIER. I DON'T BILLS OR

03:42:54.360 --> 03:42:55.929
SOMETHING LEAD TO LOTS OF

03:42:55.995 --> 03:42:57.697
FINANCE DISTRESS FOR CAO. AND

03:42:57.764 --> 03:43:00.300
OTHERS WHO RECEIVE A NETWORK.

03:43:00.366 --> 03:43:01.334
BUT THEY ARE PLAY IMPORTANT

03:43:01.401 --> 03:43:02.736
ROLE IN LEADING TO HIGHER

03:43:02.802 --> 03:43:03.570
NEGOTIATED FOR IN NETWORK

A UNIVERSE OF THE CALL DUFFY

03:43:12.746 --> 03:43:15.548
AND I DOCUMENTED HOW MUCH CAL.

03:43:15.615 --> 03:43:18.351
ANOTHER COULD SAVE IF ADDED

03:43:18.418 --> 03:43:19.719
THAT POLICY WERE WORD. AN

03:43:19.786 --> 03:43:20.920
ESSENTIAL IF WE THOUGHT ABOUT

03:43:20.987 --> 03:43:22.889
POLICY THAT LIMIT HOW MUCH

03:43:22.956 --> 03:43:24.591
PATIENTS A WRIST. FOR OUT OF

03:43:28.194 --> 03:43:32.232
BE FOR. WHAT WE- WAS THAT IF.

03:43:32.298 --> 03:43:33.733
WAS TO THINK ABOUT A THAT WOULD

03:43:33.800 --> 03:43:36.636
CAP. AT A NETWORK BILL AT 2%

03:43:36.703 --> 03:43:40.940
MEDICARE. INTO A FEW KEY A OUT

03:43:41.007 --> 03:43:43.009
OF NETWORK BILL. THE MAXIMUM

03:43:43.076 --> 03:43:44.377
AMOUNT THAT YOU IS A PATIENT

03:43:44.444 --> 03:43:46.880
FOR IS 2% MEDIC. THE BATTLE

03:43:46.946 --> 03:43:48.515
PLACE DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON HOW

ENDEAVOR PRICES ARE OR GOING TO

03:43:50.950 --> 03:43:52.719
GO SHADED AND COULD LEAD

03:43:52.786 --> 03:43:54.988
SAVINGS OF 30% OVER FOR IN

03:43:55.054 --> 03:43:58.324
PRICE. AT THE SAME TIME THE

03:43:58.391 --> 03:44:00.393
ALTERNATIVE APPROACH OF INSTEAD

03:44:00.460 --> 03:44:01.294
OF CAPPING RELATIVE TO

CALIFORNIA. WOULD RELEASE TWO

03:44:08.101 --> 03:44:12.105
WOULD RESULT IN. SIMILAR

03:44:12.172 --> 03:44:14.140
SAVINGS OF A TWO SEVEN PER.

03:44:14.207 --> 03:44:19.112

03:48:43.776 --> 03:48:45.411
CRITICAL JUNCTURE WE'RE AT NOW

03:48:45.478 --> 03:48:47.447

IF YOU'LL AT THE RIGHT HAND

03:48:59.592 --> 03:49:01.427
THAT THAT WOULD BE A 100%

03:49:01.494 --> 03:49:03.663
TREATY CALIFORNIA- OF THE

03:49:03.729 --> 03:49:05.465
UNITED STATES RATHER. AS A

03:49:05.531 --> 03:49:06.999
HUNDRED PERCENT. CAN YOU SEE

03:49:07.066 --> 03:49:08.768
ALL THOSE DOTS SCATTERED AROUND

03:49:08.835 --> 03:49:10.136
THOSE ARE DOTS OF OTHER

03:49:10.203 --> 03:49:11.304
COUNTRIES FOR EACH OF THOSE

03:49:11.370 --> 03:49:13.206
PROCEDURES EVERYTHING FROM HIP

03:49:13.272 --> 03:49:15.274
REPLACEMENTS AND ANGIOPLASTY TO

03:49:15.341 --> 03:49:16.943
CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION AND SO

03:49:17.009 --> 03:49:18.644
FORTH. AND YOU SEE THERE JUST A

03:49:18.711 --> 03:49:20.213
FRACTION OF THE UNITED STATES

03:49:20.279 --> 03:49:24.150
CHARGES. AND IF YOU HIT THE

03:49:24.217 --> 03:49:25.685
SLIDE ONE MORE TIME YOU'LL SEE

03:49:25.751 --> 03:49:30.723
A POP UP- GOING ON. AND THE

03:49:30.790 --> 03:49:32.225
ANSWER THE IS THAT PRICE ARE

03:49:32.291 --> 03:49:34.193
PRIMARY REASON THE U. S. SPENDS

03:49:34.260 --> 03:49:35.761
MORE THE WONDERFUL ARTICLE WAS

03:49:35.828 --> 03:49:37.296
WRITTEN YEARS AGO BY A-

03:49:37.363 --> 03:49:38.931
TERRIFIC ECONOMIST WITH A

03:49:38.998 --> 03:49:41.167
REINHARDT. AT ANY IT IT'S THE

03:49:41.234 --> 03:49:43.236
PRICE STUPID AND I WAS TRYING

03:49:43.302 --> 03:49:47.039
TO CONVINCE. POLICY MIGHT.

03:49:47.106 --> 03:49:47.974
MAKERS THIS WAS FIFTY YEARS AGO

03:49:48.040 --> 03:49:49.308
THAT YOU DON'T PAY A TO PRICES

03:49:49.375 --> 03:49:51.344
THAT'S THE REAL DRIVER OF

03:49:51.410 --> 03:49:54.347
HEALTH HEALTH CARE AND I THINK

03:49:54.413 --> 03:49:55.615
THAT'S REAL FOCUS THE FOCUS HAS

03:49:55.681 --> 03:49:58.618
TO BE- COULD ENCOURAGE. A

03:49:58.684 --> 03:50:00.686
NUMBER OF YOU SPEAKERS SAID

03:50:00.753 --> 03:50:02.121
IT'S NOT DIVERT. IT'S NOT

03:50:02.188 --> 03:50:03.422
UTILIZATION IT'S AND IT'S

03:50:03.489 --> 03:50:04.557
CERTAINLY NOT QUALITY OR

03:50:04.624 --> 03:50:06.759
OUTCOMES WE ARE A LITTLE WE ARE

03:50:06.826 --> 03:50:09.762
LAGGING THE WORLD AND IN THE

03:50:09.829 --> 03:50:11.397
END QUALITY. CRAFTED OKAY NEXT

03:50:11.464 --> 03:50:13.232
COULD SLOW. COULD YOU PUT THE

03:50:13.299 --> 03:50:14.600
MICRO CLOSE TO YOU AND SO CAN

03:50:14.667 --> 03:50:22.141
HEAR YOU BETTER. SURE. AT SURE.

03:50:22.208 --> 03:50:26.846
THE THING YOU. THE UP. IF YOU

03:50:26.913 --> 03:50:28.614
COULD HIT THE NEXT SLIDE THE-

03:50:28.681 --> 03:50:30.883
THIS IS THAT IT REVEALED BY

03:50:30.950 --> 03:50:32.051
THIS IN THE DATA YOU HEARD ORAL

03:50:32.118 --> 03:50:35.588
TODAY HOSPITAL BECAUSE IN

03:50:35.655 --> 03:50:36.989
CALIFORNIA ARE EX. AND WHAT

03:50:37.056 --> 03:50:39.025
THIS LAW ILLUSTRATES IS THAT. A

03:50:39.091 --> 03:50:40.793
BIG OF LAW INCREASES OUR

03:50:40.860 --> 03:50:42.728
HOSPITAL SYSTEMS THAT IS

03:50:42.795 --> 03:50:44.263
ENTITIES THAT OWN THREE OR MORE

03:50:44.330 --> 03:50:47.266
HOSPITALS- AND MULTI HOSPITAL

03:50:47.333 --> 03:50:48.935
SYSTEMS ARE REALLY THE LARGEST

03:50:49.001 --> 03:50:50.903
DRIVER OF COST THEY WERE THE

03:50:50.970 --> 03:50:52.605
TARGET OF THE SUTTER CASE THAT

03:50:52.672 --> 03:50:53.873
I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT IN A

03:50:53.940 --> 03:50:56.409
LITTLE LITTLE WHILE BUT IT'S

03:50:56.475 --> 03:50:56.976
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT

03:50:57.043 --> 03:50:58.744
CONCENTRATION REALLY DOES DRIVE

03:50:58.811 --> 03:51:01.914
COSTS HERE. WHEN HIT THE NEXT

03:51:01.981 --> 03:51:05.551
SLIDE PLEASE. THIS JUST REPEAT

03:51:05.618 --> 03:51:06.252
WHAT YOU JUST HEARD FROM THE

03:51:06.319 --> 03:51:08.020
PREVIOUS SPEAKER AND IT'S JUST

03:51:08.087 --> 03:51:11.257
A SNAPSHOT OF THE NORTH SOUTH

03:51:11.324 --> 03:51:12.425
DIVIDE IN CALIFORNIA WITH THIS.

03:51:12.491 --> 03:51:17.129
SHOWING A 30% DIFF IN IN NORTH

03:51:17.196 --> 03:51:22.935
FOR SOUTH. OF IT WHAT'S THE X.

03:51:23.002 --> 03:51:23.536
FOR ALL THIS WELL. CERTAINLY

03:51:23.603 --> 03:51:24.737
CONCENTRATE IS I THINK MOST OF.

03:51:24.804 --> 03:51:27.640
AGREE THE REASON THE BOTTOM DRY

03:51:27.707 --> 03:51:30.676
OF HI COSTS AND DO WE MEAN BY

03:51:30.743 --> 03:51:33.212
CA. YOU COULD ACCOUNTS. AS A

03:51:33.279 --> 03:51:35.915
SHORE. FOR LACK OF COMPETITION

03:51:35.982 --> 03:51:37.049
TOO FEW COMPETITORS HAVE WITH

03:51:37.116 --> 03:51:38.918
THEIR TOO FEW COMPETITORS JUST

03:51:38.985 --> 03:51:40.353
A COUPLE OF GAS STATIONS ACROSS

03:51:40.419 --> 03:51:41.821
THE STREET FROM EACH OTHER.

03:51:41.887 --> 03:51:42.688
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE NO

03:51:42.755 --> 03:51:45.324
INCENTIVE TO DRIVE PRICES DOWN

03:51:45.391 --> 03:51:46.826
AND THAT'S THE STORY THROUGHOUT

03:51:46.892 --> 03:51:48.494
ECONOMIC HISTORY AND IT'S

03:51:48.561 --> 03:51:49.395
CERTAINLY THE STORY IN

03:51:49.462 --> 03:51:50.796
HEALTHCARE JUST TONS OF

03:51:50.863 --> 03:51:53.833
ECONOMIC STUDIES. SHOWING JUST

03:51:53.899 --> 03:51:56.669
THAT WHEN I GO TO THE NEXT

03:51:56.736 --> 03:51:59.038
SLIDE. SO THIS IS THIS CHART IS

03:51:59.105 --> 03:52:02.041
A IT A NOTABLE ONE. UP IN A MAY

03:52:02.108 --> 03:52:03.175
BE A LITTLE HARD TO READ. BUT

03:52:03.242 --> 03:52:05.678
IT IT DISPLAYS THE DIFFERENT

03:52:05.745 --> 03:52:08.014
LEVELS OF. CONCENTRATION IN

03:52:08.080 --> 03:52:10.416
CALIFORNIA. NOW THE WAY TO

03:52:10.483 --> 03:52:12.418
THINK ABOUT CONCENTRATION IS

03:52:12.485 --> 03:52:12.985
THERE'S A LEVEL AT WHICH THE

03:52:13.052 --> 03:52:15.321
LAW THE ECONOMISTS AND OTHERS

03:52:15.388 --> 03:52:17.590
SAY IS HIGHLY CONCENTRATED. AND

03:52:17.657 --> 03:52:20.593
THAT LEVEL IS AROUND BETWEEN

03:52:20.660 --> 03:52:21.827
TWO THOUSAND AND THREE THOUSAND

03:52:21.894 --> 03:52:24.030
ON THIS H. H. I. INDEX. SO IF

03:52:24.096 --> 03:52:25.364
YOU LOOK IF YOU TO AN IMAGINARY

03:52:25.431 --> 03:52:27.199
LINE RIGHT BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND

03:52:27.266 --> 03:52:29.368
AND THREE THOUSAND AT TWENTY

03:52:29.435 --> 03:52:29.935
FIVE HUNDRED THAT'S WHERE WE

03:52:30.002 --> 03:52:30.770
REALLY START TO WORRY ABOUT

03:52:30.836 --> 03:52:32.872
CONCENTRATION. AND WE'RE GOING

03:52:32.938 --> 03:52:34.440
TO SEE YOU SEE THAT THE BOTTOM

03:52:34.507 --> 03:52:36.309
LEVEL THE LEVEL THAT'S PRIMARY

03:52:36.375 --> 03:52:38.077
CARE IT'S BELOW THAT LEVEL SO

03:52:38.144 --> 03:52:40.279
MOST PRIMARY CARE PRACTICES ARE

03:52:40.346 --> 03:52:43.282
NOT HIGHLY CONCENTRATED. BUT AS

03:52:43.349 --> 03:52:43.816
YOU MOVE UP YOU SEE THE

03:52:43.883 --> 03:52:45.718
INSURANCE THE NEXT LINE UP THE

03:52:45.785 --> 03:52:48.254
SCALE THE INSURANCE MARKET IS.

03:52:48.321 --> 03:52:50.423
SOMEWHAT HIGHLY CONCENTRATED

03:52:50.489 --> 03:52:51.157
CERTAINLY ABOVE TWENTY FIVE

03:52:51.223 --> 03:52:53.392
HUNDRED. AND AS YOU GO FURTHER

03:52:53.459 --> 03:52:54.994
UP THE NUMBERS BECOME

03:52:55.061 --> 03:52:57.897
ASTRONOMICAL- SPECIALTY

03:52:57.963 --> 03:53:00.900
PHYSICIANS AT FORTY. ONE

03:53:00.966 --> 03:53:03.736
HUNDRED S. LEVEL AN HOSPITALS

03:53:03.803 --> 03:53:06.839
AT FIVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED

03:53:06.906 --> 03:53:07.773
NINETY FIVE IN CALIFORNIA JUST

03:53:07.840 --> 03:53:09.141
TO GIVE YOU WHAT THE SNAPSHOT

03:53:09.208 --> 03:53:11.911
OF WHAT THAT MEANS. THAT HIGH

03:53:11.977 --> 03:53:13.112
CONCENTRATION RATE AT THE

03:53:13.179 --> 03:53:14.413
HOSPITAL LEVEL THIS MEANS IT'S

03:53:14.480 --> 03:53:16.315
A ONE HOSPITAL TOWN STE THE

03:53:16.382 --> 03:53:18.617
HOSPITAL HAS SEVENTY MAYBE 75%

03:53:18.684 --> 03:53:20.386
OF THE OF THE PATIENT

03:53:20.453 --> 03:53:22.054
ADMISSIONS. AND MAYBE ANOTHER

03:53:22.121 --> 03:53:25.057
HOSPITAL HAS TENER OR FIFTEEN.

03:53:25.124 --> 03:53:26.692
SO THAT'S THAT'S WHERE WE ARE

03:53:26.759 --> 03:53:27.993
IN CALIFORNIA HIGH

03:53:28.060 --> 03:53:33.432
CONCENTRATION ACROSS. THE BOARD

03:53:33.499 --> 03:53:35.334
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. WHAT I JUST

03:53:35.401 --> 03:53:36.902
TALKING ABOUT IS HOW. COMPTON

03:53:36.969 --> 03:53:40.206
COUNTS. FEW COMPETITORS FOR

03:53:40.272 --> 03:53:41.741
EACH HOSPITAL IN THEIR MARKET

03:53:41.807 --> 03:53:43.242
VIEW COMPETITORS FOR EACH

03:53:43.309 --> 03:53:44.744
SPECIALTY PHYSICIAN IN THEIR

03:53:44.810 --> 03:53:47.813
MARKET. NOW I'M TURNING TO

03:53:47.880 --> 03:53:48.848
VERTICAL CONCENTRATION AND BY

03:53:48.914 --> 03:53:50.249
VERTICAL AS A COUPLE SPEAKERS

03:53:50.316 --> 03:53:51.550
HAVE MENTIONED VERTICAL

03:53:51.617 --> 03:53:54.220
CONCENTRATION HAS TO DO WITH

03:53:54.286 --> 03:53:56.255
HOSPITALS ACQUIRING PHYSICIANS-

03:53:56.322 --> 03:53:59.024
END. DID ECONOMICS WE SAY YOU

03:53:59.091 --> 03:54:01.460
REQUIRE AN IMP TORQUE. TO YOUR

03:54:01.527 --> 03:54:06.065
SIR. IN CAN SEE IS DE INCREASE

03:54:06.132 --> 03:54:07.133
IN THE OF HIGH. PRACTICES THAT

03:54:07.199 --> 03:54:09.568
HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED BY ODDS

03:54:09.635 --> 03:54:11.036
FISTS GIVE PHYSICIAN PRACTICE

03:54:11.103 --> 03:54:11.904
THE HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED BY

03:54:11.971 --> 03:54:18.010
HOSPITAL. SPECIALTY. PRACTICES

03:54:18.077 --> 03:54:19.979
ARE NOW UP 252% OWNED BY. OR

03:54:20.045 --> 03:54:23.549
COULD BY HOW. AND FORTY TWO PER

03:54:23.616 --> 03:54:25.651
FOR PRIMARY. OKAY SO LET'S JUMP

03:54:25.718 --> 03:54:27.353
TO THE NEXT SLIDE SO WHAT IS

03:54:27.420 --> 03:54:29.922
THIS ALL WE US WELL. THE TAKE

03:54:29.989 --> 03:54:34.460
AWAY HERE IS. THIS IS THE L.

03:54:34.527 --> 03:54:36.695
THAT INCREASE CONCENTRATE.

03:54:36.762 --> 03:54:38.130
LEADS TO HIGHER PROVIDE

03:54:38.197 --> 03:54:40.332
PROVIDER PRICES SO HIGHER.

03:54:40.399 --> 03:54:41.734
CONCENTRATION MEANS THEY CAN

03:54:41.801 --> 03:54:43.769
BARGAIN FOR HIGHER PRICES AND

03:54:43.836 --> 03:54:44.870
HIGHER PRICES LEAD TO HIGHER

03:54:44.937 --> 03:54:47.339
PREMIUMS THAT'S THE SCENARIO

03:54:47.406 --> 03:54:49.608
THAT I THINK THE OVERWHELMING

03:54:49.675 --> 03:54:51.410
NUMBER OF STUDIES AND ECONOMIST

03:54:51.477 --> 03:54:53.312
AGREE ON I WON'T GO INTO ANY AT

03:54:53.379 --> 03:54:54.980
THE DATA THAT MUCH THE FIRST

03:54:55.047 --> 03:54:56.615
THE FIRST. BULLET POINT SHOWS

03:54:56.682 --> 03:54:58.017
YOU THAT EVEN NIGHT WITH A

03:54:58.083 --> 03:54:59.885
MODEST INCREASE OF

03:54:59.952 --> 03:55:02.488
CONCENTRATION- YOU SEE IN A

03:55:02.555 --> 03:55:03.956
THOUSAND DOLLAR A YEAR INCREASE

03:55:04.023 --> 03:55:06.625
IN IN PRICES- STUDIES HAVE

03:55:06.692 --> 03:55:09.662
SHOWN INCREASES OF 2240% AFTER

03:55:09.728 --> 03:55:11.397
MERGERS OF CLOSELY. RELATED

03:55:11.464 --> 03:55:14.333
HOSPITALS IN LOCAL MARKETS. SO

03:55:14.400 --> 03:55:15.434
TO WITH PHYSICIAN.

03:55:15.501 --> 03:55:19.772
CONCENTRATION CRITIC POSITION

03:55:19.839 --> 03:55:20.339
CRISIS CONCENTRATION RES IN

03:55:20.406 --> 03:55:25.377
HIGH PRICE. TO GO DOWN TO THE

03:55:25.444 --> 03:55:25.978
THIRD LOW WHAT IS HAVE TO DO

03:55:26.045 --> 03:55:27.780
WITH WITH COST. ACAP ARE A GOOD

03:55:27.847 --> 03:55:30.282
MATCH. AND IT TURNS OUT THAT

03:55:30.349 --> 03:55:30.883
FOR TO AND IS A- WITH HIGHER

03:55:30.950 --> 03:55:32.952
PRICES THESE THREE STUDIES OUR

03:55:33.018 --> 03:55:36.789
ROLE FROM THE PETROUS. GROUP AT

03:55:36.856 --> 03:55:38.190
THE BERKELEY AND THEY'VE DONE

03:55:38.257 --> 03:55:40.860
JUST REMARKABLE STUDIES AND

03:55:40.926 --> 03:55:42.528
THEY SOME OF THEIR STUDIES WERE

03:55:42.595 --> 03:55:45.898
INSTEAD. IN GETTING TO HELP

03:55:45.965 --> 03:55:47.700
BRING THE- THE SUTTER CASE AND

03:55:47.766 --> 03:55:48.868
FINALLY THE LAST ONE'S REALLY

03:55:48.934 --> 03:55:50.669
INTERESTING BECAUSE NOW THERE'S

03:55:50.736 --> 03:55:52.171
A STUDY COMING OUT OF STANFORD-

03:55:52.238 --> 03:55:54.173
BY LAWRENCE BAKER SHOWING THAT.

03:55:54.240 --> 03:55:55.774
WHEN SPECIALIST INTEGRATE WITH

03:55:55.841 --> 03:55:57.843
GENERALIST WITH PRIMARY CARE

03:55:57.910 --> 03:55:59.211
THE PRICES OF BOTH GO UP

03:55:59.278 --> 03:56:01.580
WITHOUT NOTABLE INCREASES IN

03:56:01.647 --> 03:56:05.551
QUALITY SO. THE POTENTIAL FOR

03:56:05.618 --> 03:56:08.754
HIGHER PRICES OCCURS ACROSS THE

03:56:08.821 --> 03:56:09.154
BOARD WHEN THERE'S

03:56:09.221 --> 03:56:12.525
CONCENTRATION. WE COULD GET

03:56:12.591 --> 03:56:16.896
FLIPPED TO THE NEXT SLIDE. THIS

03:56:16.962 --> 03:56:20.933
THIS NEXT. FOCUS ON THE

03:56:21.000 --> 03:56:23.435
CULPRITS WHO ARE THEY AND HOW

03:56:23.502 --> 03:56:25.804
TO WE GET HERE THAT FOR COOPER

03:56:25.871 --> 03:56:28.240
AND I SHOULD MENTION I NINE

03:56:28.307 --> 03:56:29.742
YEARS AS AN IN WITH THE JUST TO

03:56:29.808 --> 03:56:32.645
AND EACH DIVISION AND THERE HAS

03:56:32.711 --> 03:56:33.979
BEEN UNDER ENFORCEMENT OF

03:56:34.046 --> 03:56:36.415
ANTITRUST MERGER LAW A PERIOD

03:56:36.482 --> 03:56:38.751
OF SEVEN YEARS ELAPSED IN THE

03:56:38.817 --> 03:56:41.020
LATE NINETIES UP WHEN NO CASES

03:56:41.086 --> 03:56:43.022
WERE BROUGHT AND THAT. GAVE A

03:56:43.088 --> 03:56:44.823
BRIGHT GREEN LIGHT TO MERGERS

03:56:44.890 --> 03:56:47.326
CONSOLIDATION WENT ON A PACE

03:56:47.393 --> 03:56:49.862
AND WE SAW A HUGE INCREASE IN

03:56:49.929 --> 03:56:51.363
MERGERS RESULTING AND

03:56:51.430 --> 03:56:55.067
CONCENTRATION- THIS IS BEEN

03:56:55.134 --> 03:56:56.802
REVERSED EXTENT BUT THERE HAVE

03:56:56.869 --> 03:56:58.537
BEEN A SERIES OF A RONI IS. BY

03:56:58.604 --> 03:57:00.105
THE COURTS NOW AS A LAW

03:57:00.172 --> 03:57:02.107
PROFESSOR LIKE DECLINE THE

03:57:02.174 --> 03:57:03.676
COURTS NO DON'T KNOW WHAT

03:57:03.742 --> 03:57:05.210
THEY'RE DOING BUT IN THE CASE

03:57:05.277 --> 03:57:08.847
THE DATA ACTUALLY IT. STAY OF

03:57:08.914 --> 03:57:10.182
RETROSPECTIVE STUDIES HOSPITAL

03:57:10.249 --> 03:57:12.117
MERGERS THAT WERE ALLOWED TO GO

03:57:12.184 --> 03:57:14.219
THROUGH. THEY WENT TO TRIAL AT

03:57:14.286 --> 03:57:15.454
A COURT APPROVED THEM THESE

03:57:15.521 --> 03:57:17.423
RETROSPECTIVE STUDIES- THE

03:57:17.489 --> 03:57:19.358
PRICES DID IN FACT INCREASE AS

03:57:19.425 --> 03:57:20.225
WAS PREDICTED BY THE

03:57:20.292 --> 03:57:22.595
GOVERNMENT. SO THOSE CASES PLUS

03:57:22.661 --> 03:57:23.662
THE GREEN LIGHT OF UNDER

03:57:23.729 --> 03:57:25.064
ENFORCEMENT REALLY LEAD TO

03:57:25.130 --> 03:57:26.732
CONCENTRATION. WHAT ELSE IS OUT

03:57:26.799 --> 03:57:28.500
THERE WELL AS YOU'VE JUST

03:57:28.567 --> 03:57:33.339
HEARD. FROM FOR MR WILEY THE-

03:57:33.405 --> 03:57:34.840
THERE WERE GAPS IN BREAK. AND

03:57:34.907 --> 03:57:36.208
IN FACT SOME RAKE. ACTUALLY

03:57:36.275 --> 03:57:38.877
ENCOURAGE MERGERS YOU HEARD HIM

03:57:38.944 --> 03:57:45.284
TALK ABOUT PAYMENTS. THAT WE

03:57:45.351 --> 03:57:47.019
PHYSICIAN AT. OF SOAK SIDE OF

03:57:47.086 --> 03:57:48.587
SERVICE. AND THERE'RE A NUMBER

03:57:48.654 --> 03:57:51.190
OF OTHERS I'VE WRITTEN A COUPLE

03:57:51.256 --> 03:57:53.592
PAPERS THAT TRY TO. WHERE THE

03:57:53.659 --> 03:57:56.228
RED BROTHER FELL BY ACTUALLY.

03:57:56.295 --> 03:57:58.464
CONCENTRATION WITHOUT HELPING

03:57:58.530 --> 03:58:00.799
CONSUMERS ANOTHER ANOTHER-

03:58:00.866 --> 03:58:02.935
BECAUSE OF CONCENTRATION IS

03:58:03.002 --> 03:58:05.838
WHAT I CALL THE ACA MAY BE DO

03:58:05.904 --> 03:58:06.572
WHAT DEFENSE THEY SAY ALL THE

03:58:06.639 --> 03:58:08.073
ACA WANTED EVERYBODY TO GET

03:58:08.140 --> 03:58:10.442
TOGETHER OF WANTED INTEGRATION.

03:58:10.509 --> 03:58:11.210
NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM

03:58:11.276 --> 03:58:13.679
THE TRUTH I SOMETIMES TELL MY

03:58:13.746 --> 03:58:15.047
STUDENTS YOUR DOCTOR MAY TELL

03:58:15.114 --> 03:58:16.782
YOU AND DOCTORS HAVE FOUND YOU

03:58:16.849 --> 03:58:18.117
KNOW A GLASS OF WINE WITH

03:58:18.183 --> 03:58:19.718
DINNER MAY BE GOOD FOR YOUR

03:58:19.785 --> 03:58:21.620
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM. BUT YOUR

03:58:21.687 --> 03:58:22.821
DOCTOR WOULD TELL YOU DON'T

03:58:22.888 --> 03:58:24.289
DRINK THREE BOTTLES OF WINE

03:58:24.356 --> 03:58:26.025
WITH DINNER- THAT'S THE THAT'S

03:58:26.091 --> 03:58:29.094
THE FALLACY THAT THAT SO OFTEN

03:58:29.161 --> 03:58:30.663
PORTRAYED BY SOME OF THE-

03:58:30.729 --> 03:58:32.197
MERGING PARTIES THAT THEY'RE

03:58:32.264 --> 03:58:34.633
JUST. TO REGULATION THAT IS NOT

03:58:34.700 --> 03:58:36.368
WHAT THE ACA WAS ABOUT AND

03:58:36.435 --> 03:58:37.836
FINALLY WILL THIS CREATED WHAT

03:58:37.903 --> 03:58:40.406
I CALL A GOLD RUSH MENTALITY

03:58:40.472 --> 03:58:41.940
HOSPITALS BEGAN TO THINK BOY IF

03:58:42.007 --> 03:58:42.841
I DON'T REQUIRE MY NEIGHBOR

03:58:42.908 --> 03:58:44.977
SOMEONE ELSE WILL OR IF I DON'T

03:58:45.044 --> 03:58:47.946
GRAB A POLE WITH. SO ELSE WILL.

03:58:48.013 --> 03:58:52.851
WE GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. SO THE

03:58:52.918 --> 03:58:55.554
NEXT LINE I I'D I JUST AS WELL

03:58:55.621 --> 03:58:57.489
ABOUT A TRUST LAW. WE HAVE A

03:58:57.556 --> 03:58:59.892
HIGH TWENTY. OF IT FOR OF AN H.

03:58:59.958 --> 03:59:02.695
LAW WE'VE- UP SOME BIG WE'VE-

03:59:02.761 --> 03:59:06.198
STOPPED. COULD AND AREAS WHAT'S

03:59:06.265 --> 03:59:08.801
GOING ON WELL FIRST OF ALL I

03:59:08.867 --> 03:59:09.334
MENTIONED THE SEVEN YEARS

03:59:09.401 --> 03:59:12.471
NEGLECT THAT. TO THESE- A LOT

03:59:12.538 --> 03:59:14.139
OF THE CONSOLIDATION AND BY THE

03:59:14.206 --> 03:59:15.841
WAY LET ME JUST MENTION THE

03:59:15.908 --> 03:59:17.276
COURTS HAVE RIGHTED THE SHIP.

03:59:17.342 --> 03:59:19.178
THE LAST FIVE OR SIX CASES

03:59:19.244 --> 03:59:20.646
BROUGHT BY THE JUSTICE

03:59:20.713 --> 03:59:22.715
DEPARTMENT IN FTC. HAVE REALLY

03:59:22.781 --> 03:59:24.850
CORRECTED THE ERRORS OF THE OF

03:59:24.917 --> 03:59:26.618
THE EARLIER CASES THERE'S A

03:59:26.685 --> 03:59:28.153
MAJOR CASES PENDING RIGHT NOW

03:59:28.220 --> 03:59:29.421
IN FACT THERE'S A MAJOR ONE IN

03:59:29.488 --> 03:59:30.656
PHILADELPHIA OF JEFFERSON

03:59:30.723 --> 03:59:33.959
HOSPITAL IN. EINSTEIN HOSPITAL

03:59:34.026 --> 03:59:36.095
BUT I THINK I THINK IT BE SAID

03:59:36.161 --> 03:59:37.563
THAT THE COOK THE LAW REALLY

03:59:37.629 --> 03:59:39.765
HAS HAS CLASS. THE STANDARDS

03:59:39.832 --> 03:59:42.000
BUT IN SOME WAYS THE HORSES OUT

03:59:42.067 --> 03:59:43.335
OF THE BARN. WHAT ABOUT CONDUCT

03:59:43.402 --> 03:59:45.604
CAN ANY TRUST REALLY PENAT

03:59:45.671 --> 03:59:46.739
SHOULD DANNY TRUST REALLY

03:59:46.805 --> 03:59:49.708
PENALIZE. BAD ACTS. ACTION BY

03:59:49.775 --> 03:59:52.177
DA PER. WELL HERE'S THE THING

03:59:52.244 --> 03:59:54.313
THAT A LOT OF GOOD CERTAINLY A

03:59:54.379 --> 03:59:58.484
LOT OF LA PEOPLE TO KNOW. ANTI

03:59:58.550 --> 03:59:59.384
TO. DOES NOT PROHIBIT MEN ARE

03:59:59.451 --> 04:00:01.420
PRICE. THERE'S NOT IN THE LAW

04:00:01.487 --> 04:00:03.622
THAT SAYS AMANDA. CAN CHARGE

04:00:03.689 --> 04:00:08.961
HIGH. OLYMPIC LAW DOES. IS SAY.

04:00:09.027 --> 04:00:13.398
ANTI THAT DOMINATE CAN'T DO

04:00:13.465 --> 04:00:14.800
THAT MAKE. THEIR MEN ARE THAT

04:00:14.867 --> 04:00:18.504
ARE IN. OR OBTAIN THE MONOPOLY.

04:00:18.570 --> 04:00:20.172
SO WHICH WAS THE- AT. HOLDING

04:00:20.239 --> 04:00:22.007
ONTO YOUR MAY NOT BY. MEANS BUT

04:00:22.074 --> 04:00:23.041
YOU'VE GOT IT YOU CAN CHARGE

04:00:23.108 --> 04:00:25.310
PRICE IN A- IS A PAY TIGER WITH

04:00:25.377 --> 04:00:27.579
TO GO TO THAT. KIND OF CONDUCT.

04:00:27.646 --> 04:00:31.483
AND FOR RELYING ON IT EACH LIVE

04:00:31.550 --> 04:00:32.351
IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE IT'S SO

04:00:32.417 --> 04:00:34.153
COSTLY AND THESE CASES TAKE FOR

04:00:34.219 --> 04:00:42.828
EVER TO BE. TO BE FINISHED. AND

04:00:42.895 --> 04:00:43.462
THE ONLY APPLIED TO ONE PARTY.

04:00:43.529 --> 04:00:45.664
SO WHEN YOU ONE SUIT ONE WITH

04:00:45.731 --> 04:00:47.566
OTHER WOULD PAY ATTENTION. AND

04:00:47.633 --> 04:00:48.634
NOT DO THE SAME THING HAVE

04:00:48.700 --> 04:00:50.903
GOTTEN GAUGE OF THE MERGER. BUT

04:00:50.969 --> 04:00:53.205
SOMETIME IT'S WERE IT I IS THIS

04:00:53.272 --> 04:00:54.606
I USE TO HEAR SO OF MY FRIEND

04:00:54.673 --> 04:00:56.341
AND PRIVATE PRACTICE UNDER. THE

04:00:56.408 --> 04:00:58.110
SAID THERE'S NO WAY THERE NO

04:00:58.177 --> 04:01:00.979
MERGE NOT TRY. IT OKAY THROWN

04:01:01.046 --> 04:01:03.882
IN. YOU DON'T IN A SERIOUS

04:01:03.949 --> 04:01:05.017
TROUBLE LOSE SOME IN. BUT IT

04:01:05.083 --> 04:01:07.085
MIGHT WORTH IT TO TRY TO GO MY-

04:01:07.152 --> 04:01:08.287
AND FIND ANOTHER. IS THAT

04:01:08.353 --> 04:01:10.789
THERE'S AN ADDED IN FOR. OFTEN

04:01:10.856 --> 04:01:12.324
THE IN JUSTO KNOW WHEN TO BE

04:01:12.391 --> 04:01:14.426
THE CASES HAVE ACCESS TO

04:01:14.493 --> 04:01:16.128
EXPERTS AT CETERA AND THAT'S

04:01:16.195 --> 04:01:17.162
WHY I THINK THE DISCUSSION

04:01:17.229 --> 04:01:19.064
WE'VE BEEN HAVING ABOUT THE HPC

04:01:19.131 --> 04:01:20.732
IS REALLY IMPORTANT. HAVING

04:01:20.799 --> 04:01:22.367
THAT EXPERT AT THE ALREADY TO

04:01:22.434 --> 04:01:24.203
HELP IS REALLY IMPORTANT. CAN

04:01:24.269 --> 04:01:29.575
WE FLIP TO THE NEXT SLIDE- OKAY

04:01:29.641 --> 04:01:30.843
I GOT A BUNCH OF MINUTES I

04:01:30.909 --> 04:01:31.510
WOULD JUST WANT TO BRIEF

04:01:31.577 --> 04:01:34.046
ADDRESS ABOUT CONSOLIDATION.

04:01:34.112 --> 04:01:35.247
THE FIRST ONE I'VE WRITTEN A

04:01:35.314 --> 04:01:36.648
COUPLE PAPERS ON THIS I CALL IT

04:01:36.715 --> 04:01:39.218
THE SUMO WRESTLER FALLACY. AND

04:01:39.284 --> 04:01:40.986
THE IDEA HERE IS THAT SOME

04:01:41.053 --> 04:01:43.121
PEOPLE ASSUME IN SOME COURTS OF

04:01:43.188 --> 04:01:44.723
ACTUALLY SORT OF ASSUMED. THAT

04:01:44.790 --> 04:01:46.158
CONSUMERS ARE BETTER OFF WHEN

04:01:46.225 --> 04:01:48.160
YOU HAVE A BIG INSURER HEALTH

04:01:48.227 --> 04:01:50.295
INSURER. BUMPING ITS BELLY

04:01:50.362 --> 04:01:53.265
AGAINST A BIG HOSPITAL SYSTEM.

04:01:53.332 --> 04:01:54.233
THE TWO WILL JUST ORT OF DUKE

04:01:54.299 --> 04:01:55.667
IT OUT IN THE RING AND

04:01:55.734 --> 04:01:57.002
CONSUMERS WILL BE BETTER OFF.

04:01:57.069 --> 04:01:58.270
AGAIN NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER

04:01:58.337 --> 04:01:59.972
FROM THE TRUTH ECONOMIC THEORY

04:02:00.038 --> 04:02:01.506
DOESN'T SUPPORT THAT. AND

04:02:01.573 --> 04:02:02.674
ECONOMIC HISTORY DOESN'T

04:02:02.741 --> 04:02:04.209
SUPPORT THAT WE HAVE A NUMBER

04:02:04.276 --> 04:02:05.611
OF CASES WHERE THE TWO

04:02:05.677 --> 04:02:07.145
WRESTLERS SHOOK HANDS THERE'S A

04:02:07.212 --> 04:02:08.780
FAMOUS CASE UP IN BOSTON WITH

04:02:08.847 --> 04:02:11.016
THE DOMINANT. INSURER IN THE

04:02:11.083 --> 04:02:12.117
DOMINANT HOSPITAL SYSTEM.

04:02:12.184 --> 04:02:13.886
ESSENTIALLY HAD BUT THE BOSTON

04:02:13.952 --> 04:02:15.921
GLOBE CALLED A HANDSHAKE IN THE

04:02:15.988 --> 04:02:18.123
SNOW. SO IT'S JUST AS EASY FOR

04:02:18.190 --> 04:02:21.560
THEM TO TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER

04:02:21.627 --> 04:02:22.995
AS IT IS TO CONCLUDE. ANOTHER

04:02:23.061 --> 04:02:25.163
METHOD X. IS THE I THAT MARK

04:02:25.230 --> 04:02:27.165
ARE SELF CORRECT AND IN SOME

04:02:27.232 --> 04:02:28.901
AREAS SURE ENTRY AND OTHER

04:02:28.967 --> 04:02:30.602
FACTORS CAN CORRECT. MARKET

04:02:30.669 --> 04:02:33.005
POWER AND DEAL WITH. A DOMINANT

04:02:33.071 --> 04:02:35.340
FIRMS IN INNOVATION CAN CHANGE

04:02:35.407 --> 04:02:37.142
THINGS. THAT ISN'T THE CASE IN

04:02:37.209 --> 04:02:38.310
HEALTHCARE THEIR ENORMOUS

04:02:38.377 --> 04:02:40.312
BARRIERS TO ENTRY AND ALTHOUGH

04:02:40.379 --> 04:02:41.113
THERE ARE SOME IMPORTANT

04:02:41.179 --> 04:02:43.081
INNOVATIONS THAT NEED TO BE

04:02:43.148 --> 04:02:43.715
ENCOURAGED INCLUDING

04:02:43.782 --> 04:02:45.717
TELEMEDICINE. THEY'RE NOT GOING

04:02:45.784 --> 04:02:48.787
TO. REPLACE THE NEED FOR IN IN

04:02:48.854 --> 04:02:50.923
PATIENT CARE. AND HOSPITALS

04:02:50.989 --> 04:02:52.224
HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN

04:02:52.291 --> 04:02:54.626
MOVING TO OUTPATIENT CARE

04:02:54.693 --> 04:02:56.528
DOMINANCE AS WELL. FINALLY

04:02:56.595 --> 04:02:58.830
ANOTHER BIT IS THAT QUALITY

04:02:58.897 --> 04:03:01.466
IMPROVES EXERCISE INCREASES.

04:03:01.533 --> 04:03:03.602
AGAIN THE ECONOMIC STUDIES

04:03:03.669 --> 04:03:06.071
DON'T SUPPORT THAT- THEIR

04:03:06.138 --> 04:03:07.406
NUMBER OF CAUGHT THE ECONOMIC

04:03:07.472 --> 04:03:09.374
STUDIES OUT THERE THAT SHOW AT

04:03:09.441 --> 04:03:10.876
BEST. QUALITY REMAINS NEUTRAL

04:03:10.943 --> 04:03:12.110
IN FACT THERE SEVERAL STUDIES

04:03:12.177 --> 04:03:14.446
THAT SAY QUALITY WORSENS AS YOU

04:03:14.513 --> 04:03:17.115
GET BIGGER AND BIGGER- THERE

04:03:17.182 --> 04:03:18.850
ARE CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE

04:03:18.917 --> 04:03:20.352
THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

04:03:20.419 --> 04:03:22.187
THE VOLUME OF. SERVICES

04:03:22.254 --> 04:03:24.056
PROVIDED AND QUALITY THERE

04:03:24.122 --> 04:03:25.524
THOSE HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO EXIST

04:03:25.590 --> 04:03:27.192
IN THE- IN TRAUMA AND A FEW

04:03:27.259 --> 04:03:29.127
OTHERS. BUT THERE'S CERTAINLY

04:03:29.194 --> 04:03:31.096
NO REASON FOR IT ACROSS THE

04:03:31.163 --> 04:03:32.864
BOARD LENIENCY. SHOULD WE THROW

04:03:32.931 --> 04:03:42.174
GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.

04:03:42.240 --> 04:03:42.741
ONE LAST MYTH THE IDEA THAT

04:03:42.808 --> 04:03:43.942
SELL. IS INTO IT'S AN- COULD.

04:03:44.009 --> 04:03:45.477
MEET REAL MEANS JUST BRINGING

04:03:45.544 --> 04:03:47.012
ENTITIES. INTEGRATE REALLY MAY

04:03:47.079 --> 04:03:50.449
DOING THE HARD OF GETTING RID

04:03:50.515 --> 04:03:52.217
OF THE IT FOR. PROP THE SILO

04:03:52.284 --> 04:03:53.385
EFFECTS AND ALL THE OTHER

04:03:53.452 --> 04:03:55.120
EFFECTS THAT PLAGUE THE

04:03:55.187 --> 04:03:56.955
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. AND THIS

04:03:57.022 --> 04:03:58.857
SAID ONE OF THE TOP ECONOMIST

04:03:58.924 --> 04:03:59.791
PUT IT I THINK PRETTY WELL WHEN

04:03:59.858 --> 04:04:01.827
HE SAID CONSOLIDATION WAS

04:04:01.893 --> 04:04:03.328
PRIMARILY FOR THE PURPOSE OF

04:04:03.395 --> 04:04:05.030
ENHANCING THE BARGAINING POWERS

04:04:05.097 --> 04:04:07.032
OF THE MERGING PARTIES. VIS A

04:04:07.099 --> 04:04:09.201
VIS THE PAYERS AND IT DIDN'T

04:04:09.267 --> 04:04:11.703
LEAD TO REAL INTEGRATION. AND

04:04:11.770 --> 04:04:12.838
ANOTHER POINT HE'S MADE ANOTHER

04:04:12.904 --> 04:04:14.272
SURVEY YOU DON'T NECESSARILY

04:04:14.339 --> 04:04:17.042
HAVE TO MERGE WITH. A RIVAL TO

04:04:17.109 --> 04:04:18.710
GET THE BENEFITS OF INTEGRATION

04:04:18.777 --> 04:04:19.978
YOU CAN DO THAT BY JOINT

04:04:20.045 --> 04:04:21.913
VENTURES AND OTHER KINDS OF

04:04:21.980 --> 04:04:23.415
ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE SHORT OF

04:04:23.482 --> 04:04:26.685
MERGER BECAUSE MERGERS REMEMBER

04:04:26.752 --> 04:04:28.320
MERGERS FOR AND JOINT VENTURE

04:04:28.387 --> 04:04:31.156
ARE LESS LESS PER MINUTE. NEXT

04:04:31.223 --> 04:04:35.394
SLIDE PLEASE. OKAY SO LET ME

04:04:35.460 --> 04:04:36.328
JUST CLOSE BY BY GOING THROUGH

04:04:36.395 --> 04:04:40.332
A COUPLE OF. IMPORTANT AT.

04:04:40.399 --> 04:04:41.066
POLICY PAPERS THAT WE'VE DONE

04:04:41.133 --> 04:04:43.301
IT YOU HASTINGS LAW SCHOOL AND

04:04:43.368 --> 04:04:45.337
ARE WORKING WITH THE FOLKS AT

04:04:45.404 --> 04:04:46.938
THAT THE PETROUS CENTER AT

04:04:47.005 --> 04:04:51.376
BERKELEY- WE'VE LOOKED AT DEB.

04:04:51.443 --> 04:04:54.646
PARTICULARLY AT THE CONDUCT OF

04:04:54.713 --> 04:04:56.915
DOMINANT PROVIDER AND PAYERS

04:04:56.982 --> 04:04:58.417
AND WE'VE ISOLATED A NUMBER OF

04:04:58.483 --> 04:05:00.252
SO CALLED ANTI COMPETITIVE

04:05:00.318 --> 04:05:02.854
CONTRACTING CLAUSES. AND THESE

04:05:02.921 --> 04:05:03.989
ARE CLOSE IS THE DOMINANT

04:05:04.056 --> 04:05:06.458
HOSPITALS IN PARTICULAR UP PUT

04:05:06.525 --> 04:05:08.360
IN PLACE THAT KEEP THEIR

04:05:08.427 --> 04:05:10.929
MONOPOLY- MOST FAVORED NATIONS

04:05:10.996 --> 04:05:12.497
CLAUSES ANTI STEERING ANTI

04:05:12.564 --> 04:05:15.300
TEARING GAG CLAUSES AS TO PRICE

04:05:15.367 --> 04:05:16.568
ALL OR NOTHING CONTRACTED

04:05:16.635 --> 04:05:18.937
EXCLUSIVE DEALING. AND THE IDEA

04:05:19.004 --> 04:05:19.938
HERE IS THAT EACH OF ONE OF

04:05:20.005 --> 04:05:21.606
THESE AND- IT LOOKS LIKE I'M

04:05:21.673 --> 04:05:22.808
NOT CONNECT TIME TO GO INTO

04:05:22.874 --> 04:05:24.342
MUCH DETAIL BUT EACH ONE OF

04:05:24.409 --> 04:05:25.877
THESE ARE SORT OF DEVICES TO

04:05:25.944 --> 04:05:28.113
PRESERVE MARKET POWER JUST TAKE

04:05:28.180 --> 04:05:29.681
ANTI STEERING FOR A MINUTE ANTI

04:05:29.748 --> 04:05:32.417
STEERING REALLY SAYS- THE

04:05:32.484 --> 04:05:33.985
DOMINANT HOSPITAL SAYS TO THE

04:05:34.052 --> 04:05:35.720
INSURER. DON'T PUT ME IN A LESS

04:05:35.787 --> 04:05:37.355
FAVORED TIER WITH YOUR

04:05:37.422 --> 04:05:38.857
BENEFICIARIES DON'T MAKE THEM

04:05:38.924 --> 04:05:42.627
PAY HIGHER- HIGHER COPAY. FOR

04:05:42.694 --> 04:05:45.263
ME BECAUSE IF YOU DO I'M GOING

04:05:45.330 --> 04:05:46.898
TO DROP. I'M GOING TO DROP OUT

04:05:46.965 --> 04:05:48.366
OF YOUR NETWORK AND IF I DROP

04:05:48.433 --> 04:05:49.601
OUT OF YOUR NETWORK YOU'RE NOT

04:05:49.668 --> 04:05:51.236
GOING TO SELL ANY AND SHARON'S

04:05:51.303 --> 04:05:53.538
THOSE KIND OF CLOSES ARE REALLY

04:05:53.605 --> 04:05:55.440
TAILOR MADE TO HELP MONOPOLIST

04:05:55.507 --> 04:05:58.543
MAINTAIN ITS MARKET POWER. ALL

04:05:58.610 --> 04:06:00.045
OR NOTHING CLOSES ARE ANOTHER

04:06:00.112 --> 04:06:01.379
ONE IN WHICH THE DOMINANT

04:06:01.446 --> 04:06:03.615
HOSPITAL SAYS- YOU WANT MY MUST

04:06:03.682 --> 04:06:05.383
HAVE HOSPITAL THE HOSPITAL YOU

04:06:05.450 --> 04:06:08.186
REALLY NEEDED AND- IN- IN

04:06:08.253 --> 04:06:10.589
OAKLAND OR OR BERKELEY HE

04:06:10.655 --> 04:06:12.257
REALLY NEED THAT HOSPITAL WELL

04:06:12.324 --> 04:06:13.058
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY THAT

04:06:13.125 --> 04:06:14.860
SAME HIGH PRICE FOR MY OTHER

04:06:14.926 --> 04:06:16.828
HOSPITALS. WHERE I DON'T HAVE

04:06:16.895 --> 04:06:18.096
MARKET POWER WHERE THERE IS

04:06:18.163 --> 04:06:21.600
REAL COMPETITION THOSE ARE JUST

04:06:21.666 --> 04:06:23.235
TWO EXAMPLES. IN THAT THESE

04:06:23.301 --> 04:06:26.805
WERE REALLY PART OF THE BECAUSE

04:06:26.872 --> 04:06:28.206
THE EVIDENCE THAT WAS GOING TO

04:06:28.273 --> 04:06:29.808
BE PRESENTED IN THE CASE THE

04:06:29.875 --> 04:06:31.209
ATTORNEY GENERAL BROUGHT

04:06:31.276 --> 04:06:32.844
AGAINST SUTTER HEALTH AND THERE

04:06:32.911 --> 04:06:34.146
IS ANOTHER CASE IS STILL

04:06:34.212 --> 04:06:35.847
PENDING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S

04:06:35.914 --> 04:06:37.382
CASE ALONG WITH THE OTHER HE

04:06:37.449 --> 04:06:38.550
BROUGHT BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

04:06:38.617 --> 04:06:41.052
AND A UNION. ARE IN THE PROCESS

04:06:41.119 --> 04:06:43.188
OF BEING SETTLED WITH THE A

04:06:43.255 --> 04:06:44.890
DECREE THAT WILL CURB THEIR

04:06:44.956 --> 04:06:47.259
CONDUCT- BUT THERE IS A CONCERN

04:06:47.325 --> 04:06:54.299
I HAVE HERE AT LEAST THAT. I

04:06:54.366 --> 04:06:54.933
THINK THEY WERE THE SETTLEMENT

04:06:55.000 --> 04:06:56.268
IS A- AND NOW. BUT IN WAYS WERE

04:06:56.334 --> 04:06:58.270
WHACK A MOLE WITH DOMINO HOSP

04:06:58.336 --> 04:06:59.271
THEY WILL COME UP WITH WAYS OF

04:06:59.337 --> 04:07:02.674
AROUND SOME OF THE SOME OF THE-

04:07:02.741 --> 04:07:04.142
SOME OF THE FIXES WE PUT IT.

04:07:04.209 --> 04:07:05.911
OKAY LET ME JUST BRIEFLY GO

04:07:05.977 --> 04:07:08.813
OVER A COUPLE OF THE TWO OF

04:07:08.880 --> 04:07:10.448
POLICY PAPERS WE'VE PUT OUT

04:07:10.515 --> 04:07:12.851
COULD I GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE

04:07:12.918 --> 04:07:14.419
PLEASE. THE FIRST ONE REALLY

04:07:14.486 --> 04:07:15.954
GOES BACK TO THE QUESTION OF

04:07:16.021 --> 04:07:17.522
CAN WE IMPROVE JUST MERGER

04:07:17.589 --> 04:07:20.392
ENFORCEMENT CAN WE REALLY GET.

04:07:20.458 --> 04:07:22.661
AT LEAST WITH RESPECT TO

04:07:22.727 --> 04:07:23.795
MERGERS GOING FORWARD FROM NOW

04:07:23.862 --> 04:07:26.298
ON CAN WE GET BETTER ATTENTION

04:07:26.364 --> 04:07:28.300
PAID TO THEM. AND HERE I THINK

04:07:28.366 --> 04:07:29.501
THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAN

04:07:29.568 --> 04:07:31.703
PLAY THAT ADAM PORTEN ROLE AND

04:07:31.770 --> 04:07:34.406
CERTAINLY- THE CALIFORNIA STATE

04:07:34.472 --> 04:07:35.740
ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS BEEN A

04:07:35.807 --> 04:07:38.109
LEADER- IT NOT JUST THIS

04:07:38.176 --> 04:07:39.411
ATTORNEY GENERAL PICK FOR YEARS

04:07:39.477 --> 04:07:41.379
PAST HAS BEEN A LEADER IN IN

04:07:41.446 --> 04:07:43.381
THIS AREA- AND WHAT DO THEY

04:07:43.448 --> 04:07:45.016
NEED. WHAT DO THEY NEED WHAT

04:07:45.083 --> 04:07:45.483
THEY MIGHT NEED SOME

04:07:45.550 --> 04:07:47.552
LEGISLATIVE HELP TO IMPROVE

04:07:47.619 --> 04:07:49.521
THEIR PERFORMANCE ONE IS THEY

04:07:49.588 --> 04:07:51.156
SHOULD HAVE PRIOR NOTICE OF ALL

04:07:51.223 --> 04:07:53.658
MERGERS MANY MERGERS ARE UNDER

04:07:53.725 --> 04:07:55.627
THE RADAR SCREEN THEY OCCUR AND

04:07:55.694 --> 04:07:58.964
ONCE A MERGER HAPPENS. IT IT'S

04:07:59.030 --> 04:08:00.799
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO CHALLENGE

04:08:00.865 --> 04:08:02.067
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T UNSCRAMBLE

04:08:02.133 --> 04:08:05.637
THE EGG THE PEOPLE HAVE THE

04:08:05.704 --> 04:08:06.638
MERGING PARTIES HAVE REARRANGED

04:08:06.705 --> 04:08:07.872
THEIR BUSINESS. THEY LAID

04:08:07.939 --> 04:08:09.808
PEOPLE OFF SO UNLESS THEY GET

04:08:09.874 --> 04:08:12.344
PRIOR NOTICE- IT'S VERY HARD

04:08:12.410 --> 04:08:13.778
AND THEY'RE JUST I. DON'T HAVE

04:08:13.845 --> 04:08:14.512
TIME TO GO INTO IT BUT THERE'S

04:08:14.579 --> 04:08:15.914
BEEN A BIG MOVEMENT AMONG HEDGE

04:08:15.981 --> 04:08:17.415
FUNDS TO ACQUIRE PRACTICES

04:08:17.482 --> 04:08:19.751
AROUND THE COUNTRY AND THOSE

04:08:19.818 --> 04:08:20.318
HAVE BEEN LARGELY INVISIBLE.

04:08:20.385 --> 04:08:21.620
YOU MIGHT ALSO WANT PRIOR

04:08:21.686 --> 04:08:22.721
APPROVAL BY THE ATTORNEY

04:08:22.787 --> 04:08:24.522
GENERAL SO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

04:08:24.589 --> 04:08:26.558

04:14:33.925 --> 04:14:35.259
LIST THAT THE PEOPLE OF PETROUS

04:14:58.950 --> 04:15:00.184
COUNTIES THAT HAVE TO BE

04:15:00.251 --> 04:15:02.253
SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED BECAUSE

IN SOME CASES THEY ARE WHAT

04:15:03.821 --> 04:15:05.189
THEY CALL THE ACTUAL MONOPOLIES

04:15:05.256 --> 04:15:06.557

SECONDLY IF THERE IF THERE ARE

04:15:20.138 --> 04:15:21.873
THOSE MECHANISMS HOW COULD THEY

04:15:21.939 --> 04:15:24.409

04:15:47.298 --> 04:15:50.268
A B. DOLLARS TO CALIFORNIA.

04:15:50.334 --> 04:15:55.306
HOSPITALS AND PROVIDERS- THAT'S

04:15:55.373 --> 04:15:56.441
A LOT OF MONEY AND THE QUESTION

04:15:56.507 --> 04:15:58.776
IS WHERE DID IT GO WELL THE

04:15:58.843 --> 04:16:01.713
AGAIN THIS THE A STUDY DONE BY

04:16:01.779 --> 04:16:03.147
BY THE PETROUS CENTER- RACING

04:16:03.214 --> 04:16:05.783
REALLY SEVERE QUESTIONS ABOUT

04:16:05.850 --> 04:16:06.751
THAT BECAUSE IT APPEARS. A LOT

04:16:06.818 --> 04:16:10.455
OF THAT MONEY WENT TO THE- THE

04:16:10.521 --> 04:16:11.889
HOSPITALS THAT ARE DOMINANT THE

04:16:11.956 --> 04:16:14.392
HOSPITALS THAT HAVE. A LOT OF

04:16:14.459 --> 04:16:18.362
MONEY IN THE BANK IN FACT- THE

04:16:18.429 --> 04:16:19.330
WRITERS OF THAT REPORT

04:16:19.397 --> 04:16:21.466
SUGGESTED- THE WAY THE MONEY

04:16:21.532 --> 04:16:23.668
WAS ALLOCATED WENT. ON THE

04:16:23.735 --> 04:16:25.136
BASIS OF PATIENT REVENUE FROM

04:16:25.203 --> 04:16:27.905
PRIVATE INSURERS PER HOSPITAL

04:16:27.972 --> 04:16:30.641
WELL THE BIG. HEALTHY HOSPITALS

04:16:30.708 --> 04:16:31.843
HAVE A LOT OF MONEY FROM

04:16:31.909 --> 04:16:33.411
PRIVATE INSURERS MANY OF THE

04:16:33.478 --> 04:16:35.179
RURAL AND SMALLER HOSPITALS DO

04:16:35.246 --> 04:16:38.516
NOT. IN THE MONEY WENT- IN A

04:16:38.583 --> 04:16:40.551
HIGHER PROPORTION AND AT LEAST

04:16:40.618 --> 04:16:42.053
THE AUTHORS OF THAT STUDY

04:16:42.120 --> 04:16:45.022
SUGGESTS THAT THE- THE FACT

04:16:45.089 --> 04:16:46.791
THAT HIGHLY CONCENTRATED MARKET

04:16:46.858 --> 04:16:49.026
HOSPITALS ARE ABLE TO. EXTRACT

04:16:49.093 --> 04:16:50.528
HIGHER PRICES AND THOSE HIGHER

04:16:50.595 --> 04:16:52.830
PRICES TURNING TO HIRE. CARES

04:16:52.897 --> 04:16:54.799
ACT RELIEF- IS REALLY

04:16:54.866 --> 04:16:56.868
PROBLEMATIC SO I THINK WE OUGHT

04:16:56.934 --> 04:16:57.835
TO TAKE A LOOK AT JUST WHERE

04:16:57.902 --> 04:16:58.970
THE MONEY WENT TO WHETHER

04:16:59.036 --> 04:17:01.973
WHETHER SOME OF THAT. EXCESS

04:17:02.039 --> 04:17:05.243
RELIEF- OR TO BE RE EXAMINED-

04:17:05.309 --> 04:17:06.110
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

04:17:06.177 --> 04:17:08.212
INTERESTING- ANECDOTES OUT

04:17:08.279 --> 04:17:10.748
THERE IN THE NEW YORK TIMES RUN

04:17:10.815 --> 04:17:12.450
ARTICLES. SHOWING THAT HOSP

04:17:12.517 --> 04:17:14.952
WOULD LITERALLY. OF CASH IN THE

04:17:15.019 --> 04:17:17.822
BANK. RECEIVED A LOT OF KERR'S.

04:17:17.889 --> 04:17:19.724
SO THAT CERTAINLY SOMETHING TO

04:17:19.791 --> 04:17:21.058
LOOK AT AS WELL AS TAKING A

04:17:21.125 --> 04:17:22.627
HARD LOOK AT JUST WHAT THE COST

04:17:22.693 --> 04:17:29.066
AND- EXPENSE SITUATION. IS FOR

04:17:29.133 --> 04:17:32.436
THE RURAL HOSPITALS. WE I THINK.

04:17:32.503 --> 04:17:34.305
