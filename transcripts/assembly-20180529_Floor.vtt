I'M WANT TO INTERVENE.

03:30:03.825 --> 03:30:07.728 region:rollup2
BUT IT IS NOT ALWAYS A CASE

03:30:05.793 --> 03:30:10.198 region:rollup2
WHERE ONE SHOULD LOSE THEIR

03:30:07.728 --> 03:30:11.899 region:rollup2

THINGS BEGIN TO FALL APART AND

03:30:22.343 --> 03:30:26.380 region:rollup2

WE SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY. TO.

03:30:40.962 --> 03:30:45.399 region:rollup2

03:30:59.881 --> 03:31:03.117 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT OFTEN I GET UPON ON

03:31:02.016 --> 03:31:04.452 region:rollup2
GUN BILLS BUT I JUST IT BEFORE

03:31:03.117 --> 03:31:05.486 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES

03:31:04.452 --> 03:31:07.688 region:rollup2
AND I JUST FEEL THE NEED TO BE

03:31:05.486 --> 03:31:09.090 region:rollup2
ABLE TO SAY. WE CANNOT I MEAN WE

03:31:07.688 --> 03:31:10.725 region:rollup2
HAVE TO ANY GUNS ON OUR STREETS

03:31:09.090 --> 03:31:12.426 region:rollup2
WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE A LOT OF

03:31:10.725 --> 03:31:14.162 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT USE GUNS AT ALL

03:31:12.426 --> 03:31:15.796 region:rollup2
KINDS OF DIFFERENT WAYS. TO TRY

03:31:14.162 --> 03:31:17.532 region:rollup2
TO STIGMATIZE PEOPLE WITH MENTAL

03:31:15.796 --> 03:31:19.100 region:rollup2
HEALTH ISSUES UP FOR EVER I

03:31:17.532 --> 03:31:20.101 region:rollup2
THINK SOMETIMES CAN BE SOMETHING

03:31:19.100 --> 03:31:21.569 region:rollup2
THAT WE FEEL GOOD ABOUT IN THE

03:31:20.101 --> 03:31:23.070 region:rollup2
MOMENT. OF BUT IF WE'RE REALLY

03:31:21.569 --> 03:31:25.306 region:rollup2
TRYING TO LOOK AT THE OVERALL

03:31:23.070 --> 03:31:26.674 region:rollup2
ISSUE OF OF GUNS AND PEOPLE

03:31:25.306 --> 03:31:27.441 region:rollup2
GETTING HURT WITH THEM I THINK

03:31:26.674 --> 03:31:29.377 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO LOOK A LITTLE BIT

03:31:27.441 --> 03:31:30.945 region:rollup2
DEEPER. A AND IF WE REALLY WANT

03:31:29.377 --> 03:31:32.013 region:rollup2
TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GET HELP.

03:31:30.945 --> 03:31:34.015 region:rollup2
THEN I THINK WE NEED TO BE VERY

03:31:32.013 --> 03:31:35.983 region:rollup2
CAREFUL ABOUT LIFETIME

03:31:34.015 --> 03:31:37.718 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES FOR PEOPLE WITH

03:31:35.983 --> 03:31:38.419 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WE WANT

03:31:37.718 --> 03:31:39.987 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO GET HELP WE DON'T WANT

03:31:38.419 --> 03:31:41.155 region:rollup2
THEM TO BE SHYING AWAY FROM

03:31:39.987 --> 03:31:42.490 region:rollup2
GETTING HELP NOR DO WE WANT

03:31:41.155 --> 03:31:43.724 region:rollup2
THEIR FAMILIES NOT TO BE.

03:31:42.490 --> 03:31:46.160 region:rollup2
SEEKING HELP FOR THEM.

03:31:43.724 --> 03:31:47.728 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY ARE IN NEED OF HELP A

03:31:46.160 --> 03:31:49.030 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN WE KNOW MENTAL HEALTH

03:31:47.728 --> 03:31:50.865 region:rollup2
IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE TREATED

03:31:49.030 --> 03:31:51.532 region:rollup2
BUT WE KNOW THAT WE NEED MORE

03:31:50.865 --> 03:31:52.333 region:rollup2

03:31:51.532 --> 03:31:54.435 region:rollup2
FOLKS.

03:31:52.333 --> 03:31:57.772 region:rollup2
