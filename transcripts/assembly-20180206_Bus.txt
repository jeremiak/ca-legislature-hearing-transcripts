GOOD MORNING EVERYONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US HERE. WITH RESPECT TO OUR SIMPLY BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS COMMITTEE. OUR PERMISSION OR HEARING A WHICH IS THE TITLE CURES TO POINT OH. THE ON ADVANCING TECHNOLOGY TO COMBAT THE OAK YOU A CRISIS AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE TERMINOLOGY OF CURIOUSITY REFERS TO THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE UTILIZATION REVIEW AND. EVALUATION SYSTEM. OF THIS ALSO IS BEING TELEVISED AND SO FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE WATCHING THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US. WE HAVE ALL HEARD ABOUT THE LOOK YOU EIGHT EPIDEMIC AND THE DEVASTATION ACROSS OF THE COUNTRYWITH RESPECT TO. VARIOUS LIVES IN CALIFORNIA IT MOST CERTAINLY IS NO EXCEPTION NEARLY TWO THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS. A LOST THEIR LIVES TO A FEW WEIGHTS IN A SINGLE YEAR AND THAT WAS BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN AND JUST WANT TO MAKE A RECOGNITION OF THAT NUMBERTWO THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS. OUT WHO INDICATE THAT NOW WHEN THEY GO TO SEE IT A DOCTOR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL THAT THEY WOULD BE CURED OF SUCH ELEMENTS WHEN IN FACT THEY BECOME. ADDICTED TO SUCH MEDICATIONS AND THEN ULTIMATELY PASS AWAY. ALSO TODAY WE'LL LEARN MORE ABOUT THE CRISIS AND HOW MIGHT BE ABLE TO STOP IT. ALLEN JOINED BY NUMBER OF COLLEAGUES WHO WILL BE JOINING US THROUGHOUT OF THIS MORNING SO I THINK YOU FOR THAT ACKNOWLEDGMENT. WILL CEMENT TO MAKE IT KNOWN THAT SEVERAL YEARS AGO THESE THIS DATABASE WAS CONSIDERED A FAILED TO STATE I T. PROJECT. AND SO TODAY HOPEFULLY WE'LL LEARN ABOUT THE UPGRADED SYSTEM AND ITS SUCCESSES FINALLY WE'LL HEAR FROM ACTUAL HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS WHO GIVE US. OF THE REAL WORLD EXPERIENCES. AS WELL AS EXPERTS ON ALTERNATIVE NON OPIOID PAIN MANAGEMENT OPTIONS. ALSO WITH THAT IF YOU'LL. ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE OUR FIRST PANEL. WHICH WOULD INCLUDE TWO HEALTH EXPERTS TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW A REVIEW OF THE. OKAY WAIT CRISIS THE FIRST PERSON AS DOCTOR KAREN SMITH DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER AND THE SECOND INDIVIDUAL IS DR KELLY PFEIFFER DID A DIRECTOR AT THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION. AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US AND PLEASE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS I'M DOCTOR KAREN SMITH THE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER IN THE DIRECTOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. WITH NEARLY TWO THOUSAND OPIOID OVERDOSE DEATHS PER YEAR SEVENTY PERCENT OF WHICH ARE DUE TO PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS. AND ANOTHER APPROXIMATELY EIGHT THOUSAND HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT ADMISSIONS. AND NEARLY TWENTY FOUR MILLION PRESCRIPTIONS WRITTEN CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO FACE A SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. EVEN THOUGH OUR OVERALL RATES OF OPIOID DUSTIN OVERDOSES ARE LOWER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE THE HEALTH AND ECONOMIC BURDEN IS SUBSTANTIAL. BECAUSE OF THE ABSOLUTE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM OWN MIND CALIFORNIA'S FORTY MILLION PEOPLE. THERE IS ALSO WIDE VARIATION GEOGRAPHICALLY FROM TO AND FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY WITH SOME COUNTIES OVERDOSE RATES HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. AND SOME COUNTIES ARE ARE HAVE DEATH RATES AS HIGH AS THOSE IN THE HEART OF THE HARDEST HIT STATES IN THE COUNTRY. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS APPROACHING THIS THROUGH LEVERAGING A MULTI SECTOR STRATEGIC COLLABORATION AT BOTH THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS. TO BUILD A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO ADDRESS THIS EPIDEMIC. THAT APPROACH INCLUDES COORDINATION OF EFFORTS THROUGH THE STATE WIDE MULTI AGENCY WORKING GROUP. CHANGES IN POLICIES OF PUBLIC PAYER HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS NEW LEGISLATION MANDATING THE USE A PRESCRIPTION DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM. AND CREATING A ONE TIME THE LOCKS AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT. ALSO CHANGES IT TO REGULATIONS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO NALOXONE THROUGH PHARMACIES. PHYSICIAN AND PHARMACIST EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC AWARENESS AND EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS FOR YOUTH AND HIGH BURDEN COUNTIES. AND SUPPORTING TWENTY FIVE LOCAL SAFETY OPIOID SAFETY COALITIONS. THE FOUNDATION OF OUR SUSTAINABLE APPROACH IS A COMMON AGENDA SHARED MEASURES OF PROGRESS AND ALIGNED ACTIVITIES TOWARD COMMON SET OF GOALS THIS IS CLASSIC A COLLECTIVE IMPACT APPROACH. WE HAVE SEVEN BROAD STRATEGIES THAT WE ARE PURSUING SIMULTANEOUSLY. CREATING A COLLABORATIVE STATEWIDE OPIOID SAFETY WORK GROUP PROMOTING SAFE PRESCRIBING PRACTICES AND POLICIES. BUILDING COMMUNITY CAPACITY TO RESPOND ON A LOCAL LEVEL. PROMOTING EXPANSION OF MEDICALLY ASSISTED TREATMENT. SUPPORTING NALOXONE AVAILABILITY DISTRIBUTION AND USE CONDUCTING PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS TO INCREASE CONSUMER AND PATIENT AWARENESS. AND TRANSLATING DATA INTO ACTIONABLE INFORMATION. PROMOTING SAFE PRESCRIBING PRACTICES. WE ARE WORKING WITH HEALTH PLANS AND PAYERS TO STOP UNNECESSARY STARTS OF OPIOID PRESCRIPTIONS. BY THROUGH POLICIES THAT PROMOTE ALTERNATIVES TO OPIOIDS WE'RE HELPING PHYSICIANS AND OTHER CLINICIANS MANAGE ACUTE AND CHRONIC PAIN MORE CAUTIOUSLY. STARTING WITH LOWER DOSES AND NO OPIOID AND BENZODIAZEPINE COMBINATIONS WHICH OR PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS. AND REDUCING THE LEVEL OF OPIATES THAT ARE PROVIDED WHITE TAPE HELPING TO RUN THEM HAVE RESOURCES TO TAPER OFF PATIENTS WHO ARE ON HIGH AND INTERSTICES. MORE MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT SERVICES ARE NEEDED ESPECIALLY IN THE RURAL AREAS OF CALIFORNIA AND WE NEED TO PROMOTE ALL FORMS OF MEDICALLY ASSISTED TREATMENT. TOM BETTER EVIDENCE BASED IN MULTIPLE SIGHTINGS AND FOR MULTIPLE POPULATIONS INTEGRATING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTO PRIMARY CARE. ADDRESSING THE IT THE ISSUE IN PRISONS AND JAILS. ADDRESSING PREGNANT WOMEN AND OTHER VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN PARTICULAR. THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER COMPLIANCE DIVISION. HAS RECEIVED TO YEARS OF FEDERAL FUNDING TO INCREASE MEDICALLY ASSISTED THERE IN CALIFORNIA EFFORTS THAT WILL NEED NEED TO BE SUSTAINED OVER TIME. THROUGH THESE COORDINATE EFFORTS WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS. PRESCRIPTION OPIOID RELATED OVERDOSE DEATHS PEAKED IN TWO THOUSAND NINE AND WE'VE SEEN A FIFTEEN PERCENT DECREASE BY TWENTY SIXTEEN. PRICE SEVENTEEN DAVIS CURRENTLY BEING ANALYZED. HOWEVER AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE'RE BENDING THE CURVE FOR HEROIN RELATED OVERDOSES AT OVERSEE OVERDOSE DEATHS INCREASED BY FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT. FROM TWENTY TWELVE TO TWENTY SIXTEEN AND HEROIN RELATED EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS INCREASED A HUNDRE AND FORTY PERCENT. FROM TWENTY TEN TO TWENTY FIFTEEN. FEDERAL DASAM ALSO BEGUN TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE LAST TWO YEARS. THIS IS A VERY DYNAMIC EPIDEMIC EVEN AS WE ARE BEGINNING TO BEND THE CURVE AND MAKE PROGRESS AGAINST PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS. USING THIS MULTI SECTOR APPROACH THE EPIDEMIC IS TRANSITIONING TOWARD MORE ILLICIT DRUG USE INCLUDING HEROIN AND THE MOST DANGEROUS FENTANYL. ULTIMATELY THIS EPIDEMIC REQUIRES PREVENTION STRATEGIES UPSTREAM OF CLINICIAN PRESCRIBERS AND PATIENTS INCLUDING EXPANDING HEALTH PAYER AND PROVIDER REGULATORY AND POLICY OPTIONS WHICH READILY MORE READILY AND. BROADLY INFLUENCE PRESCRIBING BEHAVIOR AND STOP NEW ADDICTIVE STARTS WHILE ALSO WORKING WITH COMMUNITIES TO DEVELOP LOCAL APPROACHES TAILORED TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. UP TO DECREASE AND TO YOU CHRIS THE STIGMA OF ADDICTION. IF MEDICALLY ASSISTED THERAPY IS AVAILABLE BUT THERE'S STILL HIGH STIGMA TO BEING ADDICTED THAN PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO BE WILLING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE RESOURCES WE NEED TO DO BOTH OF THESE. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND SPECIFICALLY THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE UTILIZATION REVIEW AND EVALUATION SYSTEM LAST TIME I'M GOING TO SAY THAT OUT LOUD. CURES. PROGRAM STAFF WERE FOUNDING MEMBERS OF OUR STATEWIDE HOPE YOU AID SAFETY WORK GROUP AND HAVE BEEN STRONG PARTNERS ON BOTH THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AND THERE AND ON SEVERAL OF THE WORK GROUPS TASK FORCES. INCIDENT TALK THIS IS AND. REALLY I THINK ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS ABOUT THE WAY THAT WE'RE APPROACHING THIS EPIDEMIC IS THE DEGREE TO WHICH AGENCIES ACROSS THE THE ADMINISTRATION ARE WORKING TOGETHER AND WORKING WITH LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS. IT'S REALLY UNPRECEDENTED IN MY EXPERIENCE AND GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH AND IT SHOWING RESULTS. I WANTED TO SPEAK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE CURE SYSTEM AND ITS VITAL IMPORTANCE. TO DOJ PROVIDED DATA EARLY ON TO CD PH TO HELP DEFINE THE NATURE IN THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM AS WE BEGAN OUR WORK. SEPIA XIN DOJ ALSO WORKED JOINTLY ON SUCCESSFUL GRANT APPLICATIONS BOTH FROM THE BUREAU OF JUSTICE ASSISTANCE AND THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL. DOJ'S PROVIDED SECURITY ACCESS TO CURES TWO POINT OH DATA FOR TRACKING REGISTRATION AND USAGE OF DISPENSING RECORDS AND THEY HAVE DISSEMINATED THAT DATA TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND OPIATE SAFETY COALITIONS ACROSS THE STATE. THEY CONTRIBUTE DATA TO OUR. CALIFORNIA OPIOID SURVEILLANCE STASH BOARD WHICH I'LL MENTION OF MORE IN A MINUTE. TOGETHER CDP AGE DOJ AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS MEDICAL CENTER OF CO AUTHORED A P. A PAPER ON CALIFORNIA PHYSICIAN PHARMACISTS ATTITUDES AND KNOWLEDGE OF CURES TO PLANO. WHICH IS BEEN ACCEPTED FOR PUBLICATION BY THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE. DOJ'S BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN PROMOTING SAFE PRESCRIBING GUIDELINES BOTH THOSE WRITTEN BY THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD. AND THE CDC AS WELL AS POSTING ARE LETTER TO THE DOOR SEEPAGE STRUCTURES LETTER TO PRESCRIBERS INFORMING THEM OF THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE THAT TO THEM TO HELP MANAGE THEIR. PATIENTS WITH OPIATE ADDICTION. DOJ'S POLICY INITIATIVES ARE ALIGNED ENTIRELY WITH CD PEACHES SAFE PRESCRIBING APPROACH TO ADDRESSING THE EPIDEMIC. AND CITY PIGEON DOJ HAVE MADE DRAPERIES INTUITIONS AT NUMEROUS OPIATE CONFERENCES AND SUMMITS HELD DURING THE LAST TWO PLUS YEARS. TO EDUCATE AND ADDRESS IF YOU WOULD ISSUES. DOJ CONTINUES TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE CURES TO PLANO DATA ISSUES AND PARTICIPATES ON THE WORK FORCES DATA TASK FORCE. AS WE TRY TO REALLY BE SURE WE BRING ALL THE RELEVANT DATA SOURCES TOGETHER. CITY PAHS PRESCRIPTION DRUG OVERDOSE PREVENTION INITIATIVE WHICH IS FUNDED BY THE CDC IS PLANNING TO PROVIDE FUNDS TO ASSIST IN IMPLEMENTING DOJ'S CURES TO POINT NO INTER OPERABILITY PROJECTS WHICH WILL INTEGRATE CURES INTO ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS. AND SYSTEMS AS AUTHORIZED BY AB FORTY. ONE OF MOST IMPORTANT PILLARS TO OUR STATE WIDE COLLECTIVE ACTION IS A CONCERTED EFFORT TO TRANSLATE DATA INTO ACTIONABLE INFORMATION. THE DOJ CURE SYSTEM IS AT THE HEART OF THIS OFFER. CURES MAKES BOTH CONTROLLED DRUG PRESCRIBING AND DISPENSING DATA AVAILABLE. BOTH TO NOT JUST TO REGULATORY LAW ENFORCEMENT WHICH IS CRITICAL FORCES. DECREASING DIVERSION AND MISUSE BUT ALSO TO CLINICIANS WHO THEY CAN MAKE MAKE BETTER CLINICAL DECISION MAKING. PICTURES THERE'S ALSO USED BY THE PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNITY AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS BOTH AT THE STATE AND AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO INFORM THEIR. THEIR ACTIVITIES RELATED TO COMBATING THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC AND TO MONITOR OUR PROGRESS. YOUR STATE IS A MAJOR SOURCE OF DATA FOR THE CALIFORNIA OPIOID OVER DORSET VALENCE DASHBOARD NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE ONLINE DASHBOARD. DEVELOPED AND CURATED BY CDP AGE WOULD HAVE PROVIDED YOU WITH JUST USER SCREENSHOTS FOR WHAT IS A VERY STATIC SCREENSHOTS OF A VERY INTERACTIVE. DATA SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS YOU TO DRILL DOWN TO A VERY LOW LEVELS OF. GRANULARITY ON DATA IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES. THE DASHBOARD PROVIDES ENHANCED DATA VISUALIZATION AND INTEGRATION OF STATEWIDE AND GEOGRAPHICALLY SPECIFIC. OPIOID INVOLVED OVERDOSES DEATHS AND PRESCRIPTION DATA. THE DASHBOARD PROVIDES TIMELY AND ACTIONABLE DATA FOR USE BY STATE POLICYMAKERS LOCAL OPIOID SAFETY COALITIONS THE MEDIA. OTHER STAKEHOLDERS IN THE COMMUNITY AND THE PUBLIC. CITY PH STAFF PROVIDES TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN COALITIONS ON HOW TO USE THE DASHBOARD AND ITS DATA AND WE'VE ACTUALLY PROVIDED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO MULTIPLE STATES ON HOW TO BUILD OR IMPROVE THEIR OWN DASHBOARDS. SO IN SUMMARY THE CURE SYSTEM PROVIDES VITAL DATA THAT HELPS LAW ENFORCEMENT DECREASED ABOUT DRUG DIVERSION IMPROVES CLINICAL DECISION MAKING AND INCREASES REFERRALS TO INDUCTION THERAPY. AND PROVIDES DATA THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNITY AND OUR PARTNERS IS TRANSLATING INTO ACTIONS THAT ARE ACTUALLY HAVING A POSITIVE IMPACT IN DECREASING OPIOID RELATED OVERDOSES AND DEATHS IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. IT ANSWERING QUESTIONS. YEAH. WOULD YOU LIKE TO PAUSE FOR QUESTIONS NOW. SHAKEN PROCEED THE PLEASE JUST GO AHEAD AND. PRISON THAT THEN I'M SURE MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES WOULD HAVE ADDITION. BUT THANK YOU TO US I REMEMBER THE FOR THE INVITATION IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE MY NAME IS KELLY PAY FOR MY FAMILY DOCTOR NAY WERE THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION AND. I'M HOPING TO BUILD ON DOCTORS MISREPRESENTATION TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE EPIDEMIC IN CALIFORNIA. AND I'VE ALWAYS FOUND THE STAT NEWS. ARTICLE VERY COMPELLING BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE THE FACES OF THE EPIDEMIC AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE FACES IS JUST STRIKING HOW YOUNG THEY ARE BECAUSE ALTHOUGH ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO KILL FAR MORE PEOPLE. THEY'RE UNLIKELY TO KILL YOU IN YOUR SLEEP TONIGHT AND THAT'S ONE OF THE TRAGEDIES OF THE OPIATE EPIDEMIC IS KILLS PEOPLE YOUNG IT KILLS PEOPLE SUDDENLY. AND A FAMILY DOCTOR AND I WAS TRAINED IN THE AREA. WHERE WE THOUGHT WE ARE HELPING PEOPLE BY GIVING OPIOIDS TO? CONDITIONS WE NEVER GIVE UP UNITS AT DOSES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY SEEN ONLY IN HOSPICE AND LIKE MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES I GOT A WAKE UP CALL. WHEN I GOT A CALL FROM A CORNER OF A YOUNG WOMAN WHO DIED OF MY PILSENER HAND AGAIN THINKING THAT I WAS BEING HELPFUL ONLY ENDING IN HARM. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT HOW CALIFORNIA IS DOING COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE U. S. IT CAN BE EASY TO BE FALSELY REASSURING BECAUSE THE REST OF THE U. S. THERE. WITH. OVERDOSE RATE IS TWICE ALMOST TWICE OURS AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE RATE OF INCREASE LAST YEAR THEY THE U. S. INCREASED BY TWENTY ONE PERCENT WERE ARE. OVERDOSE RATES HAVE BEEN FAIRLY STABLE AND I DO THINK IT'S A CREDIT TO DOCTOR SMITH ON THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING STATEWIDE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. TO INCREASE ACCESS TO TREATMENT AND CHANGE PRESCRIBING HOWEVER IT'S. IT'S SOME REALLY IMPORTANT NOT TO JUST FOCUS ON THE CLIFORNIA AVERAGE BECAUSE HALF OF CALIFORNIANS LIVE SOUTH OF THE BURBANK AIRPORT AND SO THE. AVERAGE CALIFORNIAN IS REALLY STORY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WHERE THE NUMBERS ARE MUCH HIGHER THAT THE RATES ARE LOWER SYSTEM POINT TO LOOK AT THE VARIATION IN CALIFORNIA AND THESE? GRAPHS COME FROM THE DASH FOR THE DOCTOR SMITH REFERENCE WHERE WE CAN SEE PARTS OF OUR STATE OURS HARD HIT IS KENTUCKY IN OTHER AREAS. OF THE COUNTRY THAT YOU SEE IN THE NEWS ALL THE TIME. AND IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITY OF HOW WE GOT INTO THIS PREDICAMENT BECAUSE THERE'S GONNA BE NO YOU KNOW APT TO SOLVE THE OPIATE EPIDEMIC WAS THIS COMPLEX TO GET HERE IS COMPLEX TO GET OUT OF HERE OUT OF IT. CLEARLY OPIOID PRESCRIBING DROVE A BIG PIECE OF IT BECAUSE THE MORE WE DOCTORS PRESCRIBE THE HIGHER THE DEATH RATE. BUT AS A AS DR SMITH SAID MORE AND MORE OF THIS IS BECOMING AN ILLICIT DRUG PROBLEM THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN'T POSSIBLY KEEP UP WITH. BECAUSE YOU CAN GET FAT NOW IN A PILL PRESS ONLINE FOR TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS AND PUSH OUT COUNTERFEIT PILLS AND SEND YOUR CHECK THAT ONE DOWN TEN MORE POP ABSOLUTE VERY CLEAR THAT IF WE'RE GONNA STOP THIS EPIDEMIC. WE HAVE TO MAKE TREATMENT EASIER TO GET THAN HEROIN AND THAT NO. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS MAP FROM A COUPLE YEARS AGO THE RED AREAS ARE PLACES WITH NO OPI TREATMENT PROGRAMS. AND IF YOU REMEMBER THE OTHER MAPS THAT THOSE OF THE SAME AREAS WITH THE HIGH DEATH RATES AND SO THIS IS. WHAT WORKED SYSTEMATICALLY TACKLING IN CALIFORNIA TO FILL THOSE RED AREAS OF OUR STATE WITH TREATMENT ACCESS? AND IT'S ALSO WORTH MENTIONING THAT THIS IS. WITH CALLED AN EPIDEMIC OF DESPAIR BECAUSE THERE'S MANY SOCIAL AND COMMUNITY FACTOR DRIVING PEOPLE THE OPIATE ADDICTION IF YOU HAVE IT READ DREAMLAND THAT'S A FASCINATING. STORY OF AND UNDERSTANDING HOW THIS ALL CAME TOGETHER IN SOME OF THE. LOTS OF THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET AND SOCIAL NETWORKS THAT HAVE HAVE CREATED SOME OF THE PROBLEMS IN RURAL PARTS OF OUR STATE. SO AS DR SMITH MENTIONED THERE THERE'S EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT FOUR MAJOR PARTS TO COMBAT THE OPIATE EPIDEMIC AND WE'RE WORKING ON ALL FOUR ACROSS CALIFORNIA. LIFTER PREVENT A NEW GENERATION OF PEOPLE FROM BECOMING DEPENDENT. CORD ADDICTED TO THOSE DRUGS AS WORKAROUND PREVENTION WE HAVE JUST MORE SAFELY MANAGE CHRONIC PAIN WE'RE CERTAINLY SEEING A BACKLASH WHERE PEOPLE THAT WE DOCTORS HAVE MADE DEPENDED ON THESE OPIOIDS. SUDDENLY LOSE ACT ACCESS BECAUSE DOCTORS SAY CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE NOT TO PRESCRIBE OPIOIDS AT ALL AND THAT'S. CREATES A DANGER BOTH FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DEPENDENT ON OPIOIDS AND ALSO FOR PEOPLE ON PALETTE OF CARE HOSPICE WHO NEED ACCESS. SO WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON THOSE WHO ARE HIGHEST RISK AND HELP THEM GET TO SEE PRODUCES AND NOT LACK ACCESS FOR ALL. WE HAVE TO TREAT MEDIC. ADDICTION EFFECTIVELY AND IT'S QUITE CLEAR THAT IN OPIOIDS. ON OPIATE ADDICTION MEDICATIONS AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IS CRITICAL BECAUSE WITHOUT MEDICATIONS THE OVERDOSE RATE DOUBLED OR EVEN TRIPLED. AND FINALLY WE HAVE TO STOP OVER DOES DOES UNTIL WE CAN DEAL WITH THE SUPPLY PROBLEM IN THE DEMAND PROBLEM THROUGH IT TREATMENT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE USING HARM REDUCTION. LIKE NALOXONE AGAIN DOCTOR SMITH MENTIONED IS IN THE OVERDOSE ANTIDOTES TO HELP SAVE LIVES AND PEOPLE ACCIDENTALLY OVERDOSED. SO JUST A QUICK SNAPSHOT ON HOW WE'RE DOING IN EACH OF THOSE FRONTS WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR PREVENTION EFFORTS ARE TOTAL NET AMOUNT OF OPIATES WE PRESCRIBE HAS BEEN DROPPING OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. ARE HIGH DOSE PRESCRIPTIONS MEANING PEOPLE WHO ARE TAKING THE EQUIVALENT OF TWENTY NOR CAL A DAY. WHICH CAN BE A TEENY LITTLE PILL AND I THINK ONE OF THINGS THAT PEOPLE. DON'T UNDERSTAND IS AN TINY OXYCONTIN TABLET EIGHTY MILLIGRAMS A TO SMALLER THAN IT THEN AND BABY ASPIRIN. IS THE EQUIVALENT OF TWENTY FOUR NERVE CHO AND AGAIN THAT'S WHY. NGUYEN THEN AMOUNT OF PRESCRIBING HAS BEEN SO HIGH BECAUSE A SMALL PILLS JUST THAT POTENT. BUT AGAIN WE'RE DOING BETTER WITH THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON HIGH DOSE DROPPING. I TREAT EM ALTHOUGH BUPRENORPHINE OR SUBOXONE YOU'VE HEARD IS A IS A VERY COMMON TREATMENT FOR OPIATE ADDICTION IT'S OUT THE ONLY TREATMENT BUT IT'S THE ONE THAT WE CAN TRACK IN CARRIERS IN THE DATABASE AND WE USE IT AS A MARKER FOR HOW WE'RE DOING WITH ADDICTION TREATMENT. ACCESS AND WE'RE GETTING BETTER AS WELL BUT AGAIN THIS IS WE CAN'T REST BECAUSE OUR OVERDOSE DEATHS HAVE NOT DROPPED. THAT KNOWN HEROINES GOING UP IN SOME VERY FEARFUL OF WHAT WE'RE GONNA SEE NEXT YEAR. UNLESS WE REALLY. DO BETTER WITH TREATMENT. SO JUST A QUICK WORD ABOUT TREATMENT BECAUSE IT'S IT'S VERY DIFFICULT I THINK IF YOU'RE NOT MEDICINE UNDERSTAND WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU REPLACE A DRUG WITH A DRUG AND IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENS TO THE BRAIN WITH LONG TERM OPIOID ADDICTION. THE PART OF MY BRAIN. CALL THE DOPAMINE ACCESS THAT REGULATES. HOW WE CONNECT WITH OTHERS HOW WE DO THINGS THAT ARE DIFFICULT? HOW WE ORGANIZE OURSELVES THAT GETS BROKEN AND OPIATE ADDICTION AND THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING AN ADDICT IS DATED DAY CHAOS AND SURVIVAL OF? DOING EVERYTHING YOU CAN NOT TO FEEL LIKE YOU'RE GONNA DIE WHICH IS WHAT DOPES THAT MEANS IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE GONNA DIE EVERYTHING. HURTS YOU CAN'T FOCUS AND BUT WHEN YOU GET ON A LOT OF THESE MEDICATIONS WHICH STABILIZE BRAIN CHEMISTRY. THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO THINK PLAN BOND WITH OTHERS AND PARTICIPATE RECOVERY. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THEIR THREE MEDICATIONS THAT ARE APPROVED FOR OPIOID ADDICTION BUT THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT. NASDAQ DISMISSIVELY CAN'T A ONE SIZE FITS. ALL APPROACH BECAUSE WE KNOW THE METHADONE DEEPEN OUR FEET HAVE BOTH PROVEN TO DROP DEATH RATES IN HALF WERE BY EVEN TWO THIRDS. NOW TRACKS OWN WORKS WONDERFULLY I USE OFTEN HECKLED HIM THE TRIAL AND IN SUB POPULATIONS LIKE PEOPLE WITH LICENSES LIKE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND PILOTS AND DOCTORS. BUT THEY IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET ON AND ON THE FOURTH OF PEOPLE DROP OFF BEFORE THEY CAN EVEN GET ON IN THE TO TWELVE MONTHS SUCCESS RATE IS QUITE LOW. SO EVEN OF THIS BEEN A LOT OF PRESS ABOUT BEING THE SAME AS A BOXER AND FOR THREE MONTHS IT'S TRUE SHORT TERM. BUT WE DON'T KNOW A LOT OF TENNIS AGAIN OUR GOAL IS GOING TO GET ALL FORMS OF TREATMENT AVAILABLE TO ALL PEOPLE IN ALL SETTINGS. IT INCLUDING IN JAILS. SO WE HAVE SEVERAL CAMPAIGNS THAT DOCTOR SMITH REFERRED TO AND I'M JUST GOING TO BRIEFLY HIGHLIGHT EACH ONE. AND ONE OF THE AND THEY'RE ALL. REPORTING TO THE WE'RE PROVE ALL AIMING TO STAY IN ALIGNMENT TO LEAVE THIS WHO WOULD FOR TYLER CARRIES TO PLANO SMARTCAMP CALIFORNIA. THE CALIFORNIA OPIATES SAFETY NETWORK AND THAT WHAT HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS DOING WITH ADDICTION AND I'M WITH LIMITED TIME I'M JUST GOING TO BRIEFLY TOUCH AND EACH. WITH KIDS TO PLANO AS A DOCTOR I CAN NOW LOOK UP INSTEAD OF. THE WAY IT WAS A FEW YEARS AGO WHERE I GET CONFUSING REPORTS I GET KICKED OUT A LOT I CAN GET A PASSWORD IS VERY DIFFICULT TO USE. THIS IS PHENOMENAL BECAUSE I CAN GO IN AND I CAN SEE ALERTS FOR WHO OF MY PATIENTS AT HIGHEST RISK OF DEATH AND THAT'S A GAME CHANGER IS NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED. BUT IT'S NOT THAT HELPFUL UNLESS IT'S INTEROPERABLE WITH MY RECORDS BECAUSE I'M SEEING PATIENTS EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES. I CAN'T STOP LOG OUT LOG ON TO SOMETHING ELSE AND CHECK SOMETHING EXPECT THAT TO BE DONE CONSISTENTLY SO. BUILDING INTO THE WORK FLOWS SOMETHING DOJ'S REALLY WORKING HARD ON OUT IT'S GOING TO BE CRITICAL OF TWO. MORE ADOPTION OF THE OF CARE IS BY CLINICIANS. ITS MARKET CALIFORNIA'S VERY EXCITING BECAUSE IT'S THE FIRST TIME THE BIG PUBLIC PURCHASERS IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS. CALPERS COVERED CALIFORNIA MEDI CAL HAVE ALL DONE TOGETHER AND SING AND SAID WE ARE GOING TO COORDINATE AND WORK TOGETHER TO DROP OVERDOSED ASSN ADDITION TO DROP UNNECESSARY SEE SECTIONS AND BETTER. CARE OF LOW BACK PAIN AND SO THEY'RE WORKING WITH HEALTH PLANS AND PROVIDERS AND CONSUMERS AGAIN TRYING TO LINE ALL OUR EFFORTS BECAUSE HEALTH PLANS ARE POWERFUL ALLY AGAINST THE A BICU EIGHT. CRISIS BECAUSE I'M DOING THE RIGHT THING ABOUT SAFER PRESCRIBING AND MAKING SURE ADDICTION TREATMENT IS EASY ACCESS. IS CRITICAL BECAUSE AS YOU PROBABLY HAD MANY PEOPLE ARE READY TO QUIT BUT THEN HAVE INSURANCE CHALLENGES GETTING THE TREATMENT THEY NEED. THE CALIFORNIA UP ITS EIGHTEEN NETWORK IS THAT IS ALL OF THE LOCAL COALITIONS BATHTUB BOUND TOGETHER IN ONE NETWORK AND ALL OF THOSE BLUE COUNTIES. HAVE A LOCALLY LED COALITION OFTEN LED BY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT OR MEDICAL SOCIETY THAT GETS ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER LAW ENFORCEMENT PHARMACIES HOSPITALS ADDICTION TREATMENT. THEY LOOK AT THE LOCAL DATA SAY WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM IN OUR COMMUNITY AND WORK TOGETHER TO SOLVE IT AND SO IT'S VERY EXCITING FOR THAT WE'VE OF. IN JUST EIGHTEEN MONTHS SINCE THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION STARTED THIS PROJECT WE'RE SEEING MOST OF CALIFORNIA PARTICIPATING AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE IS PUT IS PUTTING FORTY VISTA VOLUNTEERS IN ALL OF THESE COMMUNITIES TO HELP. FIGHT THE EPIDEMIC SO WAS THAT A GOOD WORKFORCE IT'S QUITE EXCITING. AND FINALLY AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW THERE'S TWO MAJOR EFFORTS THAT THE HEALTH SERVICES DEPARTMENT IS LEADING TO MAKE SURE THAT MAP CHANGES IN THAT EVERYBODY CAN ACCESS TREATMENT IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD WITHOUT TRAVEL. ON THE LEFT IS THE DRUG MEDI CAL SYSTEM WHERE ALL OF THOSE ORANGE COUNTY'S HAVE PLANS TO CREATE ADDICTION TREATMENT ACCESS FOR ALL ADDICTIONS NOT JUST FOR OPIOIDS. AND ON THE RIGHT IS A REAL. TRANSFORMATION OF HOW WE THINK ABOUT METHADONE CLINICS IN THE PAST METHADONE CLINICS WHERE IN GHETTOS AND THEY WERE SEGREGATED AND THEY NEVER WOULD TALK TO ME A PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR. AND WE'RE TRYING TO CHANGE IT INTO A PRIMARY CARE SPECIALTY RELATIONSHIP WHERE FIVE A. COMPLEX HEART FAILURE PATIENTS THEY GO TO SPECIALIST WHEN THAT PERSON STABLE THEY COME BACK TO ME. AND THAT'S WERE TRYING TO DO IN METHADONE CLINICS ARE NOW SEEN AS SPECIALIST IN THERE WORKING WITH PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS. SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A SYSTEM OF OF STE OF MILDER ADDICTION TREATED IN PRIMARY CARE MORE SEVERE ADDICTION TREATED AND AND TREATMENT PROGRAMS. AND SO SOMETIMES WHEN I GET DISCOURAGED I THINK OF THE LAST MAJOR HEALTH CRISIS WE HAD AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT DEATH RATE ON THE LEFT AND WAS CLIMBING AND CLIMBING IT FELT HOPELESS. BUT WE DROPPED THE DEATH RATE FOR HIV AND WE DID IT IN A VERY SIMILAR WAY TO WHAT WE NEED TO DO NOW WHICH IS WE MADE. I'M IT IMPOSSIBLE AS A PERSON'S HIV AIDS TO TO NOT GET ACCESS TO TREATMENT ADVOCATES AND GOVERNMENT AND AND NON PROFITS CAME TOGETHER TO STRIP AWAY ANY BARRIERS FOR FROM PEOPLE FROM GETTING AIDS TREATMENT THEY NEED WHICH IS THE. EFFORT WE NEED TO. DO HERE BECAUSE STILL THOSE MANY REGULATORY INSURANCE IMPRACTICAL BARRIERS FOR PEOPLE GETTING ADDICTION TREATMENT AND WE WON'T DROPPED US INTO WE DO THAT AS WELL AS REDUCING THE STATEMENTS OF PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO COME FORTH. FOR TREATMENT SPEND EQUIVALENT OF WHAT OF MEMBER RYAN WHITE AND MAGIC JOHNSON MADE HIV FEEL MORE PERSONAL AND WHERE THEY WERE TRYING TO DO THE SAME THING WITH ADDICTION. AND IT'S BEEN DONE BUT IT'S NOT BEEN DONE IN THIS COUNTRY WHILE OUR COUNTRY DEATH RATES RISE. FRANCE WAS ABLE TO DROP THEIR DESPERATE EIGHTY PERCENT IN JUST A FEW YEARS. BY MAKING BUPRENORPHINE TEXAS A BOX ON WIDELY AVAILABLE HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS WERE REQUIRED TO PAY DOCTORS MORE TO TREAT ADDICTION. THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS NEEDING WAIVERS ARE GETTING DE A VISITING YOUR PRACTICE IT WAS MADE LIKE ANY OTHER MEDICATION VERY SIMPLE. BUT WHAT HAPPENED AND THEY ARE THERE WAS A BIG WORRY WHAT HAPPENS WITH DIVERSION IS AND FELT THE STREETS BUT TURNS OUT WHEN YOU MAKE ADDICTION TREATMENT REALLY EASY TO ACCESS. PEOPLE DON'T NEED TO BUY ADDICTION TREATMENT ON THE STREETS AND AMOUNT OF SUBOXONE DIVERSION WAS VERY VERY SMALL IN THE FRANCE EXPERIENCE. IN ANY CASE SAM A AGAIN IT WAS AN HONOR TO PRESENT IN A. THAT'S NOT GONNA BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR PFEIFFER AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE IN BED NOTES THAT OF. THIS ISSUE TRANSCENDS PARTISANSHIP AND IN FACT A NUMBER OF COLLEAGUES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLES HAVE COME HERE TODAY BECAUSE OF THEIR GREAT INTEREST IN THIS EFFORT AND IN FACT THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY OVER TEN BILLS. OF THAT WE'VE SEEN THAT HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED WITH RESPECT AS YOU ARE READY SO I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR OPPOSING YOUR EXPERTISE ON THIS. ALSO FIRST VICE VIA A QUESTION BY A SOMEONE EGGMAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I THINK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. THE A BILL AYE IN SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES APPEAR DID LAST YEAR WAS TOO WELL AUTHORIZED A. IF INJECTION SITES FOR INTERVENES DRUG USE ARE IN THAT BECAUSE IT AS AS YOU CLEARLY HAVE POINTED OUT ADDICTION IS A CONTINUUM AND IT STARTS ON OFFENSE AND. THAT DIFFEREN POINTS THE CONTINUUM THERE NEEDS TO BE DIFFERENT. MODALITIES OFFERED AND OR AS AND AS WE CONTINUE TO TO FOCUS ON HARM REDUCTION IN PREVENTING OVERDOSES. SO WE CAN GET ALL THE WAY THROUGH WHERE WE'RE STILL IN MOTION ON THAT BILL BUT I THINK I'VE BROUGH THIS MORNING SAN FRANCISCO IS GOING TO GO AHEAD AND START ONE. AND THE WAY WE HAVE A CONCEPTUALIZES I WOULD GO TO PUBLIC HEALTH IT WOULD BE THAT A COMMUNITY COLLABORATION AND THE SITES WHERE IT WOULD BE HOW WOULD BE MOST SAFE AND AS YOU POINTED OUT. THAT WOULD ONLY BE SET IN A IN THE AREA WHERE PEOPLE ARE ALREADY USING PUBLICLY UP ON THE STREETS AND OVERDOSING AND I'M JUST WONDERING WHO ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT. THE SYSTEMS LIKE THIS AND WE KNOW IT'S WORKED AND OTHER PLACES IN THE WORLD AND YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT IT HERE. WHO OF? SURE I AM I AM I CAN'T COME IN ENACTED LEGISLATION BUT I CAN SAY THAT IF I'M HARM REDUCTION IS THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT ANY CRIED DISEASE IF I HAVE A DIABETIC AND THEN THEY BINGE ON KRISPY KREME'S I TREAT THEM IN THE YEAR I DON'T JUDGE THEM. I ACCEPT THAT SEVENTY PERCENT OF DIABETICS ARE CONTROLLED AND THE OTHERS STRUGGLE AND I'M I THINK WE NEED TO ADAPT THAT SAME METHOD FOR ADDICTION REALIZING THERE'S A CONTINUUM OF BEHAVIORS. THERE'S PERFECTION WHICH VERY FEW PEOPLE ACHIEVE AND THERE'S TOTAL ALL OUT ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS OF IN THE MIDDLE IS WHERE. HARM REDUCTION LIKE SAFE INJECTION SITES AND NEEDLE EXCHANGES AND A LOT SOME LIVE IT BASICALLY IS LET'S KEEP PEOPLE ALIVE UNTIL THEY'RE READY FOR RECOVERY. BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY WAS READY FOR RECOVERY RIGHT AWAY AND THAT EVERYBODY'S PERFECT WHEN THEY ENTER RECOVERY. SO I WOULD JUST ADD THAT HARM REDUCTION STRATEGIES LIKE NEEDLE EXCHANGE LIKE SAFE INJECTION SITES HAVE ADDED BENEFITS AS WELL IN THAT THEY PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONNECT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE USING. WITH OTHER SERVICES TO EDUCATE THEM IN A FRIENDLIER ENVIRONMENT THAN MANY OTHER ENVIRONMENTS THAT THEY COME INTO BUT ALSO PROVIDING CLEAN. SYRINGES AT HAVE AND WELL PROVIDING CLEAN SYRINGES HELPS US REDUCE RATES OF TRANSMISSION OF HIV AND OTHER BLOOD BORNE DISEASES LIKE HEPATITIS C. WHICH IS EPIDEMIC THROUGHOUT. ON THE UNITED STATES INCLUDING CALIFORNIA I'M AND THEN FINALLY THE READY PROVISION OF NALOXONE IN AN INDIVIDUAL SITE AND CAN POTENTIALLY CONCEIVE OF FOLKS FROM AND RECOGNIZED FENTON ALL. INJECTIONS AND SAVE LIVES ON THE SPOT. IN THROUGH NEEDLE EXCHANGES NALOXONE IS WE'RE PRETTY THAT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE MAJOR VENUES THAT WE'RE USING TO GET NALOXONE OUT TO THE USER COMMUNITY AS WELL. THANK YOU SO SO YOU MEAN THAT WHEN WHEN SOMEONE WOULD CALL WHEN WHEN THEY WOULD START THAT THAT CARRYING SUPPORT OF NON JUDGMENTAL RELATIONSHIP THEY MAY ALSO THEN LOOK AT ISSUES AROUND HOUSING AROUND TREATING AN ABSCESS AROUND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AROUND HUMAN TRAFFICKING. OTHER ISSUES THAT MAY IMPACT THEIR LIFE BECAUSE OF THIS YEAR DEBATE. AND ADDICTION THEY COULD ALSO THEM BECOME A BEGIN GETTING TREATMENT FOR THOSE KINDS OF THINGS TO. THAT STANDARD PRACTICE IN IN SYRINGE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS RIGHT THERE AND IF THEY BECOME ALMOST A COMMUNITY HOW BUT IN THE POSITIVE SENSE AS OPPOSED TO KIND OF THE THE VISION THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC HOUSES. I THINK YOU VERY MUCH FOR FOR YOUR EDUCATION FOR MYSELF AND ALL MY COLLEAGUES. AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE THE BOOK BILL FORWARD. IT'S ALSO QUITE ILLUSTRATIVE. TO SEE THEIR PRESENTATION KEY ELEMENTS WITH RESPECT POTENTIAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT WE'VE ALSO SEEN TOO SO THERE ARE SOME SIMILARITIES MOST CERTAINLY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WAS CHAIRMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION IT WAS QUITE ENLIGHTENING CAN TALK ABOUT THE RACIAL DISPARITIES THAT EXIST AND. POINTING THOSE RACIAL DISPARITIES OUT AND ALSO YOU MADE MENTION OF THE FRANCE FRANCE SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE GETTING A RIDE WHAT ARE WE DOING GETTING A RAW. SO I AM THIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT ADVANTAGES THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT HAS A DASHBOARD BECAUSE THIS IS BEEN DESCRIBED AS A WHITE EPIDEMIC IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND. THE WAY I'M ALL OF US HAVE BEEN WORKING ON IS THIS IS THAT EVEN THOUGH THAT'S THE WAY IT'S BEEN PORTRAYED IN THAT CERTAINLY. HIDES THE FACT THAT THERE'S BEEN HUGE INEQUITIES. FOR OTHER RACIAL GROUPS IN THE PAST WE'VE BEEN MAINLY FOCUSING ON LAW ENFORCEMENT CRIMINALIZATION AND NOW THIS WHITE AT EPIDEMIC IT SEEMS MORE FOCUSED ON TREATMENT BUT. OUR POINT OF VIEW IS THAT IS THAT AS THE MONEY AND THE ATTENTION IS COMING AND LET USE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE THE STANDARDS OF CARE FOR PEOPLE. OF ALL RACES AND ETHNICITIES AT ALL TYPES OF ADDICTION. GETTING BACK TO THE DASHBOARD IF YOU LOOK IN SAN FRANCISCO THERE'S THREE TIMES THE DEATH RATES. FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS AND THERE ARE FOR WEIGHTS FROM OPIOID OVERDOSE SO WE IN OUR URBAN AREAS IS NOT A WHITE EPIDEMIC AND SO IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT AS WE BUILD THESE NEW. STRUCTURES OF ADDICTION TREATMENT THAT WE ARE ABLE TO DO IT AND CULTURALLY COMPETENT WAYS THAT REACH OUT TO ALL COMMUNITIES. BUT I WOULD I JUST SECOND THAT PARTICULAR THE ISSUE OF LOOKING AT THE LOCAL COMMUNITY BECAUSE THIS EPIDEMIC AND AND IN TRUTH ALL DRUG USE IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM PLACE TO PLACE. THE OTHER THING THAT'S THE REASON THAT WERE FOCUSING ON STRATEGIES THAT ADDRESS THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC BUT ALSO GENERIC STRATEGIES THE DECK ADDRESS ALL ADDICTION IS THAT. WE CONTINUE TO SEE INCREASES IT FOR EXAMPLE IN METHADONE AND I'M SORRY METHAMPHETAMINE OVERDOSES. ARE GOING UP AND THAT'S TRUE IN MANY OF THE SAME PARTS OF THE STATE OF THE CALIFORNIA THAT. OPIATES ARE THE APPROACHES AROUND SAFE PRESCRIBING AT ITS CENTER THAT OBVIOUSLY ISN'T RELEVANT TO THAT PARTICULAR DRUG. OR EVEN TO SOMETHING LIKE ALCOHOLISM WHICH BY THE WAY IS STILL THE SINGLE LARGEST DRUG OF ABUSE IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN CALIFORNIA. SO WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE ONCE WE MAY WE IF WE CAN NORMALIZE ADDICTION AS A DISEASE AND THE PROVISION OF ADDICTION TREATMENT AS SOMETHING OF COURSE YOU WOULD DO. THAT I THINK WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BENEFIT OUR SOCIETY AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT AREAS. MAYBE I MISSED SOMETHING SO ARE DID YOU SAY THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS. HAS TO RECEIVE IS THREE TIMES HIGHER. IN SAN FRANCISCO THAN ANY OTHER ETHNICITY AND NATIVE AMERICANS HAVE THE HIGHEST DEATH RATE ACROSS THE STATE. YEAH SO WHERE THAT WHERE THE RESOURCES GOING IN THOSE THOSE COMMUNITIES THE TARGET THAT PARTICULAR ETHNICITY. THAT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE REASONS WE ARE WORKING SO ACTIVELY IN AND HELP EIGHT CATHERINE HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION BEGAN THE FUNDING OF OF OPI COALITIONS LOCAL COALITIONS AND WE'RE CONTINUING THAT BECAUSE THOSE COMMUNITIES. KNOW HOW TO TARGET THOSE WE ARE NOT MAKING DECISIONS AT THE STATE LEVEL ABOUT EXACTLY WHERE PARTICULAR RESOURCES SHOULD BE PLACED. WE'RE DOING THAT IN COLLABORATION WITH THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW THOSE COMMUNITIES ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS ABOUT THE STAFF BOARD IS THAT DATA IS AVAILABLE TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY SUIT ACTUALLY. IRRESPECTIVE OF WHO COMES TO THE TABLE WHAT WHAT PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS ABOUT WHO THIS EPIDEMIC IS AFFECTING. WE HAVE CONCRETE GRANULAR DATA ABOUT THEIR COMMUNITY TO HELP INFORM. EXACTLY DOT ISSUE WHERE RESOURCES GOING WHAT SPECIFIC RESOURCES ARE NEEDED WHAT ARE THE UNDERLYING SOCIAL ISSUES THAT ALSO NEED TO BE A DROUGHT. OKAY. THREE MUCH A SUMMER GALLAGHER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND. YEAH THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO BE PART OF THE COMMITTEE THIS MORNING VERY IMPORTANT. I ISSUE. IN MY DISTRICT BUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND I THINK WE SAW LOW THE NUMBERS THERE. ONE THING I WANTED TO FOCUS IN ON I THINK A. MY COLLEAGUE. AND SO MEMBER GIPSON BROUGHT UP THERE THE RACIAL. DISPARITIES ANOTHER ISSUE I THINK IS GEOGRAPHY AND. THIS IS REALLY IMPACTING THE RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE A VERY SIGNIFICANT WAY I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THOSE. YOUR YOUR. OPIATE OF THE DASHBOARD AND IT SHOWS YOU KNOW A LOT OF THESE RURAL COUNTIES ARE VERY HEAVILY. IMPACT IN TERMS OF. OVERDOSES PER PER CAPITA. HOSPITALIZATIONS PER CAPITA. AND. AND SO. THAT'S ONE THING I THINK WE HAVE TO REALLY FOCUS IN ON IS WELL AND I THINK YOU MENTIONED ONE OF THE THINGS YOU MENTIONED WAS. A LACK OF SAFETY NET THE. BUT THE OTHER ISSUE HERE IS WE'VE. YOU THAT'S THAT I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT THESE AREAS IS THE. DIMINISHING TIMBER MINING. INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACT MANUFACTURING HAS AS THAT HAS GONE AWAY. AND YOU HAVE GENERATIONS OF PEOPLE UNEMPLOYED. AND TURNING TO DRUGS AND ALCOHOL EARNED THAT HAS BEEN YOU KNOW WE SAW THE METHAMPHETAMINE WE SAW THAT NOW AND NOW WITH THE OP A CRISIS. AND THAT'S ANOTHER FACTOR YOU KNOW SO. BUT AND IN GETTING THAT THE YOU KNOW. AND THE RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE I THINK ANOTHER THING YOU SHOWED HERE IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF LOCAL. COALITIONS THERE'S RESOURCES BUT. IF YOU LOOK AT IT WHERE THOSE ARE AT IT'S ALMOST THE INVERSE OF WHERE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS ARE YOU'RE STILL SEEING A LOT OF AREAS THAT AREN'T COVERED. HOW COME YOUYOU KNOW HOW CAN WE BETTER GET THAT GETTING SOME OF THESE RESOURCES OUT TO SOME OF THE REALLY HOT SPOTS WHICH TEND TO BE IN A RURAL PARTS? OF THE STATE. NAM. IS THAT SOMETHING YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT AND WHAT KIND OF EFFORTS HERE. BEING DONE THAT IS YEAH IT'S VERY MUCH THINGS THAT WERE THAT WERE ARMED THAT THE COALITIONS THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS FUNDING ARE ACTUALLY VERY EXPLICITLY THOSE IN THESE RURAL AREAS SO THAT WE DON'T RUN THE RISK OF A COALITION NOT HAVING A FUNDING TO CONTINUE. WE ALSO HAVE SOME STRATEGIES THAT ARE VERY SPECIFIC TO THOSE RURAL AREAS FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS THAT WE'RE CREATING WERE ACTUALLY WORKING WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN THE RURAL AREAS SO THAT THAT CAMPAIGN IS VERY TARGETED TO WHO IS AT HIGHEST RISK THERE AS OPPOSED OTHER PARTS. OF THE STATE. AND FINALLY WE ALSO ARE USING. AS STRATEGY CALLED ACADEMIC DETAILING WHICH IS M. IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN SITTING IN YOUR DOCTOR'S OFFICE IN THE WAITING ROOM AND SOMEBODY INCREDIBLY WELL DRESSED STROLLS THROUGH AND GOES IMMEDIATELY TO THE BACK FOR A FEW YOU KNOW. AN HOUR TO THIS OUR DRIVE REPRESENTATIVES COMING IN TO TALK TO THEIR DOCTORS ABOUT THEIR LATEST DRUG THAT'S RELEASED IN PROVIDING THEM LOTS OF EDUCATION ON WHAT IT'S GOOD FOR HOW TO USE IT IT CETERA. THAT'S CALLED ACADEMIC DETAILING WE'RE DOING THE SAME THING USING SOME OF INDIVIDUALS FROM THOSE COMMUNITIES TO DO ACADEMIC DETAILING ABOUT SAFE PRESCRIBING ON OPIOIDS ABOUT WHO'S AT RISK OF OPIATE. OVERDOSE AND REALLY ONE ON ONE WITH THE CLINICIANS FIRST TARGETING THOSE THAT ARE HIGHEST PRESCRIBERS USING CURES TO IDENTIFY THOSE INDIVIDUALS BUT THEN MOVING OUT TO ALL THE CLINICIANS. THAT'S ON THE ON THE LEGAL PRESCRIPTION SIDE OF THE HOUSE THERE'S ALSO THE DIVERSION SIDE. COALITIONS HAVE ENGAGED LAW ENFORCEMENT AND VERY AGGRESSIVELY IN THESE AREAS TO TRY TO. SHIFT THE THE FOCUS UP AWAY FROM CRIMINALIZATION OBVIOUSLY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THOSE HEARD ARE DEALING DRUGS AND MORE TO. OTHER METHODS OF DECREASING DIVERSION ON THERE ARE SOME VERY. INTERESTING TECHNIQUES THAT HAVE BEEN USED TO HELP IDENTIFY DOT DOCTORS TO HELP THEM REALIZE THE CONSEQUENCES OF A POOR PRESCRIBING. THE WAY DOCTOR FIFER FOUND OUT ABOUT HER AND PATIENT WAS FROM A LETTER FROM THROUGH A CORNER INTO SOME OF THE SAME JURISDICTIONS. ARE TAKING THAT KIND OF APPROACH. FOCUSING ON THE DOCTORS. AND SO THEN THE OTHER THING THAT IS THIS IS WHAT WE THIS IS THE GREAT HOPE I THINK OF THIS HUB AND SPOKE MODEL AT THAT DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES IS PUTTING IN PLACE FOR MEDICALLY ASSISTED TREATMENT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUILD A CENTER OF EXCELLENCE FOR ADDICTION THERAPY IN EVERY SINGLE SMALL COMMUNITY WHAT YOU CAN DO IS PROVIDE TRAINING ON THAT WELL ACTUALLY MOONLIGHT YOU TALK ABOUT THE HAVE THE ABOUT THAT METHOD BECAUSE YOU'RE MORE OF THE CLINICIAN THAT. SO YOU CAN SEE BY THESE MAPS AT THE RURAL AREAS WERE PARTICULARLY FOCUSED. ON THE HUB AT THE HUB AND SPOKE PROGRAM WHICH IS EIGHTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS OF FEDERAL FUNDING COMING AND TIPPED TO INCREASE ACCESS SPECIFICALLY FOR OPIOID ADDICTION. IS LARGELY BEING TARGET IN THE RURAL AREAS THAT ARE THE HARDEST HIT AND THERE'S A SPECIAL PART OF THAT IS ALSO FOCUSED ON THE NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION. AND AGAIN THE AT THE IDEAS AS A PRIMARY CARE DOC AND NEVER WAS TRAINED IN ADDICTION IT'S VERY INTIMIDATING TO THINK ABOUT. STARTING THIS WHOLE NEW PRACTICE WITH SOMETHING I DON'T UNDERSTAND ESPECIALLY WITH IT THE A LOT OF TAX FEEL WHAT THERE'S A LOT OF STIGMA WHAT IF THOSE PEOPLE SHOW UP IN MY WAITING ROOM IN MY OTHER PATIENTS DON'T LIKE IT OR. OR. IT HELPS TO HAVE SENT A COACH OR MENTOR IN THAT THE WAY I STARTED BACK IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS WAS. FINDING A FRIEND WHO'D DONE IT AND HAVE AND TALKING THROUGH MY FIRST FEW CASES AND AGAIN WE WERE FINDING IT MORE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS AND DOCTORS ARE WILLING TO STEP UP TO TREAT ADDICTION. IF THEY'RE NOT ALONE IF THEY'RE ABLE TO REACH OUT TO A SPECIALIST TO GET HELP THROUGH THOSE FIRST FEW CASES. MOST OF US FIND THAT AFTER THE FIRST THREE WE SAY THIS WASN'T A BIG DEAL I DON'T KNOW WHY I WAS SO WORRIED IT'S IS A GREAT ANTI BURNOUT METHOD BECAUSE YOU SEE PEOPLE GO FROM CHAOS. TO RECOVERY IT IS INCREDIBLY REWARDING AS A DOCTOR WHEN MOST OF OUR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC DISEASES JUST GET WORSE OVER TIME. SO AGAIN THE IDEA IS THAT. THESE UMPTEEN PREVIOUSLY CALLED METHADONE CLINICS WILL BECOME THE DEBT THOSE RESOURCES AND HELP RURAL AREAS WITHOUT. SPECIALIST TREATMENT PROGRAMS BUILD THE CONFIDENCE OF THOSE LOCAL CLINICIANS TO BE ABLE TO TREAT ADDICTION AND CAN CREATE THIS NETWORK OF OF MUTUAL SUPPORT. I THINK ONE CHALLENGE ALSO FOR. RURAL AREAS AS WITH EVERY EVERY OTHER ASPECT OF HEALTH CARE AND THE LACK OF ACCESS TO IT IN THE RURAL AREAS. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE ALTERNATIVES TO OPIOID SO AND THOSE THINGS ARE. THINGS EVEN IN. MORE POPULOUS AREAS CAN BE DIFFICULT TO COME BY THINGS LIKE PHYSICAL THERAPY. THINGS LIKE. ACUPUNCTURE ETCETERA TO INCREASINGLY HEALTH PLANS ARE RECOGNIZING THAT THEY NEED TO COVER THESE SERVICES PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT HAVE A GOOD EVIDENCE BASED BUT GETTING% ACCESS TO THAT IN THE RURAL AREAS IS REALLY CHALLENGING. EVEN MORE THEN. PRIMARY CARE THING SO THAT'S ABOUT REMAIN SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO WORK HARD ON. NO THANK YOU FOR THAT I MEAN THERE WAS A LOT A LOT THERE. I'D I THINK THERE ARE SOME GOOD THINGS IN PLACE THAT ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS BUT I WOULD. HAVE MY COLLEAGUES JUST LOOK AT THAT MAP. AND YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF GRAY AREA THERE AND THOSE GRAY AREAS. OUR RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE. AND SO WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO ITS IT'S YOU KNOW THE EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE THINGS IN PLACE IN NOT SAYING THERE'S NOT HAVE BEEN SPOKE ALL THOSE. AND AND IT'S GONNA TAKE RESOURCES TO DO IT AND. THOSE WHO'VE BEEN RESPONSIBLE. FOR HELPING TO CREATE THIS EPIDEMIC NEED TO BE. PARTNERS IN IN HELPING US TO PULL THE RESOURCES TO GET THERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A SEMI DEL. I THINK YOU FIRST ALONE I THINK THAT THE CHAIR THE COMMITTEE FOR. HAVING AND WELCOME YOU HERE THIS AYE I REPRESENT. THE NORTHEASTERN PART OF THE STATE AND ACTUALLY LASSEN COUNTIES WHERE I LIVE IN A AND I'M LOOKING AT THIS HAND OUT THAT WE HAVE UP HERE. AND IT'S MY WHOLE COUNTIES COMPLETELY RED. AND SO. IT'S FORTY FIVE HUNDRED SQUARE MILES JUST LASSEN COUNTY WHERE I RESIDED FOR MY WHOLE LIFE. MY COUSIN IS A DOCTOR. WHO'S BEEN THERE FOR THIRTY YEARS OF GENERAL PRACTITIONER. WHO WORKS A ROTATION IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM? IS THE ONLY HOSPITAL FOR A HUNDRED MILES. THAT HAS A FULL TIME EMERGENCY ROOM AND SO. I SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH HIM. A TALKING ABOUT HEALTHCARE ISSUES IN RULE CALIFORNIA AS WE HAVE WE HAVE THE EIGHTY RURAL HEALTH CLINIC IN. MY COMMUNITY WHERE HE WORKS DURING THE DAY AND DOES THE ARE IN THE EVENINGS AND AND ROTATE SO WE HAVE. A VERY A. BUT IT'S VERY HARD FOR US TO GET DOC'S EVEN LIVE IN OUR AREAS NUMBER ONE SO WE HAVE A ROTATION PEOPLE COME IN AND ACTUALLY WORK OUR EMERGENCY ROOMS. AND THEN GO BACK TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. SO. I WANTED IT'S I HAVE SOME THINGS I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU AND THEN I'M AND HOUSE QUESTION AT THE END SO NUMBER ONE WE AT THIS I ASK HIM. THE FOLKS THAT COME THROUGH THE EMERGENCY ROOM WHO ARE SO WE CALM WE WE DID A BILL LAST THING WAS LAST YEAR. THAT SENATOR LARA CARED A BILL ON. OR NOT TRYING TO IDENTIFY A CURE IT CURES DATABASE PAISLEY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO IDENTIFY. AND AND TRACK. BUT THE POINT IS IS THAT A THIRD OF THE FOLKS THAT COME THROUGH THE MERGER ZERO. NO THEY SWAP THEM NOW SO THEY CAN FIND OUT WHAT OTHER IPS LOTTIE'S FOLKS RUN OTHER DRUGS IN AND. TRY NOT TO. KEEP THEM FROM ODEON BASICALLY BUT A THIRD OF THE FOLKS THAT COME THROUGH HABIT NOT THEIR PRESCRIPTION IN THEIR SYSTEM. SO THEY'RE GETTING THAT AND THEY'RE TAKING IT OUT AND IT'S A BUSINESS MACY'S A BUSINESS MODEL SO USE NOT TO CELLS NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO THIS DISCOVERY MIGHT BE IF I WAS. I KEEP GREW UP DURING THE EIGHTIES WHEN WE WHEN COCAINE WAS LIKE THE THE. RICH PERSON'S DRUG AND THEN YOU RECALL CRACK CAME OUT AND THAT WAS A LOWER LEVEL TO WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS AB OPIOID WHICH IS A WHICH IS BASICALLY A RICH PERSON'S. CHOICE AND THEN WILL NOT GETS CUT OFF THEY GO TO THE CHEAP VERSION WHICH IS NOW ON. HEROIN. AND THAT'S WHERE WE SEE A LOT OF OUR OVERDOSES SO. I MEAN ASK WHAT WHAT IT WILL IT IN INDIVIDUAL AREAS WHERE WE HAVE VERY FEW LITTLE SERVICES AND MANY MANY MILES TO TRAVEL TO GET TO THOSE SERVICES IN MANY CASES. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IS A GREAT WOULD BE THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT YOU THINK WOULD BE EDUCATION WISE BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY WE BASS THAT EDUCATE THESE FOLKS ON? WHICH SOME OF THEM THEY WANTED HER SURGERY. GOT ADDICTED AFTER WORK AFTER THEIR. SURGERY AND THEN THERE'D THERE'D CUT OFF AND THEN THEY'RE GOING TO A CHEAPER VERSION OF SOMETHING TO MANAGE THEIR ADDICTION. A AND OVER AND OVER DISTANCES ARE ONE THING THAT WE COULD FOCUS ON IN THOSE. ROLE AREAS OR. MAYBE TO THAT WE THINK WOULD BE. HELPFUL IN GETTING STARTED ON THE EDUCATION PROCESS. SO. WHEN THE TARGET IS THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND IN PARTICULAR THE THE USERS. IT IN GENERAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH THE BEST APPROACH TO THAT IS TO FIND TRUSTED SPOKESPEOPLE SO WHO IS IT THAT THOSE FOLKS REALLY LOOK TO FOR GOOD INFORMATION. BECAUSE FOR EACH. PLACE IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT AND FOR EACH POPULATION IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT AND THEN PROVIDING THOSE PEOPLE REALLY GOOD INFORMATION THAT THEY CAN THEN PASS ON IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE. WE DO WITH OUR SYRINGE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS THAT WE. PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE IN THOSE PROGRAMS AND REALLY UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE ISSUE OF OPIATES THE TRANSITION FROM OPIATES TO HEROIN ET CETERA. SO THAT THEY CAN TALK AS PEERS. AND AS TRUSTED. PURVEYORS INFORMATION TO THE POPULATIONS AND SO THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY SO MUCH OF OUR EFFORT AND RESOURCES ARE GOING TO SUPPORTING THESE LOCAL OPIOID. COALITIONS BECAUSE THEY'RE THE FOLKS WHO LIVE IN THESE COMMUNITIES SERVE THESE COMMUNITIES AND HOPEFULLY CAN HELP IDENTIFY WHO ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GIVE THOSE MESSAGES IN A WAY THAT THEY CAN BE HEARD AND UNDERSTOOD. AND HONESTLY YOU JUST HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND COMBINE IT WITH ACCESS TO TREATMENTS. THAT ARE AVAILABLE WHEN THOSE PEOPLE ARE READY. AB BECAUSE THAT IS A HUGE PART OF WHAT PREDICT SUCCESS IN RECOVERY. SO FOLLOW UP TO THAT AM. I WAS RAISED WITH OF A FATHER WHO WAS AN ALCOHOLIC IN BACK WHEN THERE WAS NO TREATMENT CENTERS AVAILABLE. AND YOU WE DIDN'T DEAL FIRST IDENTIFY THERE'S A PROBLEM YET TO THE THAT THE DEBT THAT PERSON WHO'S ADDICTED JUSTICE HAVE A PROBLEMWHICH WAS NOT POPULAR BACK INTO BETTY FORD ACTUALLY CAME OUT AND SAID HEY ALCOHOL AND. ISM IS IS A DISEASE. AND SO SAME THING IN THIS IN THIS WORLD WHERE IS THIRTY YEARS FORWARD FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS FORWARD NOW AND WORK TO WITH OPIOIDS AND WE HAVE TO IDENTIFY HEY WE HAVE A PROBLEM AND YOU CAN GET ADDICTED AND THAT NAY AND YOU WE CAN START TREATING SO I. THINK THAT'S KIND OF WHERE WE'RE AT NOW. AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT THAT FOLKS WILL FIRST REALIZE THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT SNUCK UP ON THEM IN ADDICTION IS REAL AND IT NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO. COMMUNICATE THAT TO THEM AND HAVE A PLACE FOR THEM TO GO. WHERE THERE'S A TREATMENT CENTER? AND IF I COULD BUILD ANNA AND OTHER SMIS COMMENTS IN THE RURAL AREAS WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS IS EVERY PLACE A PERSONAL ADDICTION CAN TOUCH WE WANNA MAKE SURE ADDICTION TREATMENTS THERE SO WE'VE GOT PROJECTS TO GET. SUBOXONE IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM BECAUSE IF YOU GET YOUR DOSE IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM YOU'RE TWICE AS LIKELY TO STAY IN TREATMENT SUBOXONE IN THE HOSPITAL SO IF YOU GET SAID HARD INFECTION FROM YOUR AB USE WHILE YOU'RE IN THE HOSPITAL YOU CAN GET YOUR ADDICTION TREATMENT. FORGETTING. TREATMENT ON YOUR PHONE SO THEY IS TELEHEALTH IS A GREAT SOLUTIONS OF THE YOU CAN TAP CHAIR PROVIDER AND GET COUNSELLING ON THE PHONE. AND ULTIMATELY OTHER STATES I'M HAVE REALLY INVESTED IN THIS IDEA APPEAR PROVIDERS SEE SHOW UP AT THE ER WITH AN OVERDOSE SOMEONE WHO'S WALKED IN THOSE SHOES. MEET YOU AND WORKS WITH YOU FOR THIRTY DAYS AND THAT'S I'M BEEN WIDESPREAD IN RHODE ISLAND IN NEW JERSEY IN WOULD BE. IS SOMETHING WORTH EXPLORING IT. SO I THINK WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY THIS IN PARTICULAR THIS NETWORK OF LOCAL COALITIONS A COVER SO MUCH OF THE STATE UNFORTUNATELY NOT ALL OF THE STATE AND WE ARE WORKING ON THAT. TO THEIR IT WE'RE SORT OF TRYING TO GATHER AND KIND OF A TOOL KIT OF A VARIETY OF THESE KINDS OF THERE'S THE WHOLE HEALTH CARE AND. INTERVENTIONS RICHER VERY SPECIFIC SET OF INTERVENTIONS BUT THEN THERE MANY OTHER APPROACHES TO. THE THE SOCIAL ASPECTS IN THE EDUCATIONAL ASPECT BOTH OF THE USERS AND THE COMMUNITIES AND MAKE SURE THAT THE SCHOOL LOCAL COALITIONS HAVE ACCESS TO SORT OF AN ENTIRE TOOL KIT OF. OF THINGS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT WORK FOR THEM DEPENDING ON WHO'S INVOLVED AND WHAT RESOURCES THEY HAVE. I'M AND ALSO GATHERING INFORMATION ON WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT'S WORKING WHERE BECAUSE THERE ISN'T A HUGE AYE EVIDENCE BASED FOR SOME OF THESE. KINDS OF INTERVENTIONS AND YET THEY CAN BE INCREDIBLY SIX. THANK YOU VERY MUCH US SOMEONE WHAT WALDRON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. LOTS OF GREAT INFORMATION. THERE'S JUST SO MUCH MORE THAT YOU COULD ALMOST EVERY HEARING JUST SAW THEM KNOW WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. I WAS ALSO THINKING ABOUT THE AIDS HIV YOU KNOW HISTORY THERE WHEN YOU WERE SPEAKING BECAUSE WITH A THAT UP ON THE WALL OF THE RYAN WHITE LEGISLATION THAT CAME OUT ON. THE EFFORTS OF THERE'S STILL A STIGMA EVEN WITH TREATMENT OF HIV IN PRIMARY CARE OFFICES. TO COUNSEL ON THINGS LIKE PREP AND PAP AND. YOU KNOW MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE THERE AND TRAINING AND. GOING BACK TO PHYSICIANS. ARE CURRENTLY WHO ARE OF PRACTICING. AND I COULD SEE THE SAME THING WITH THE OPIOID ISSUE. YOU KNOW WOULD IT TAKE. I EFFORTS TO HAVE THE MEDICAL BOARD GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE RESIDENCY PROGRAMS AND INCREASING. YOU KNOW CERTIFICATIONS FOR SOME BOX ON WHICH IS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT COULD REALLY HELP RURAL AREAS ESPECIALLY. SO I BELIEVE YOU'RE GOING TO BE HEARING FROM THE MEDICAL BOARD SOON ABOUT WHAT WHAT THEY'RE THEY'VE BEEN. THEY ALSO ALONG WITH FARMS SUPPORT OUR FOUNDING MEMBERS OF OUR OPIATE WORKGROUP AND HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY. THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA PUT OUT THEIR GUIDELINES WELL BEFORE THE CDC EVER PUT OUT THERE'S A CUT THEY'VE REALLY BEEN AT THE FRONT EDGE ON THIS SO. NOW THAT'S GOTTEN ON THE. YOU ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE TARGETED EDUCATION CAMPAIGN AS WELL AS THE HUB AND SPOKE. WHERE TO THE PHARMACISTS FIT INTO THAT ARE THEY PART OF THAT AND? YES ARE YOU ALSO BE HEARING FOR THE BOARD PHARMACY ANOTHER FOUNDING MEMBER HERBERT GROUP. SOME OF THE POLICY CHANGES THAT. WENT INTO EFFECT BECAUSE OF THE WORKING OF THE BOARD OF PHARMACY HAVE REALLY DRAMATICALLY. INCREASED ACCESS TO FOR EXAMPLE THE LOCKS AND. WITHOUT A PRESCRIPTION AND AND AGAIN I'M GOING TO DEFER TO THEM TO TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS FOR YOU. PALM AND JUST LAST REALLY BRIEFLY ARM ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE BEEN WORKING ON IS TRYING TO INCREASE. PRESCRIBER REIMBURSEMENT FOR. PHYSICIANS WHO BECOME CERTIFIED. ARE TO TREAT WITH SUBOXONE. AND THE. BECAUSE OF THAT AND THE WAY IT OPERATES HAVING MOTIVATED. MOST PATIENTS WHO REALLY WANT TO GET OFF THE DRUGS AND HAVE USING TELEHEALTH AND ABILITIES TO. HARM HAVE A PRESCRIPTION CAN REALLY HELP PEOPLE IN RURAL AREAS. AND I KNOW YOU MENTIONED THAT AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT BCAUSE WE HAVE. ACCORDING THE THE DATA AYE OF LESS THAN TWO PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA MEDICAL PROVIDERS A CERTIFIED. TO PRESCRIBE SO BOX ON WHICH I THINK IS YOU KNOW. AND BIG OPTION A BIG OPPORTUNITY FOR US. ONE OTHER THING CHF WILL BE SHARING IN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS IS SNAPSHOTS BY COUNTY WHERE WE ESTIMATE THE PREVALENCE OF OPIOID USE DISORDER AND I COUNTY. THE CURRENT NUMBER OF EVEN OUR FAME PRESCRIBERS AND METHADONE SLOTS AND THEN WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO MEET THE TREATMENT GAP AND SO I'M HOPING THAT WILL BE USEFUL WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOUR OWN. COUNTIES TO FIGURE OUT I'M EXACTLY HOW MUCH TREATMENT DO YOU NEED TO BUILD BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT'S BEEN ASKED. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY WOMAN OR RENT. THANK YOU OF YOU KNOWS GREAT TO SEE I MEAN. VERY HEARTENING TO SEE THAT CHART OF HOW MANY LESS PRESCRIPTIONS ARE BEING WRITTEN AND OBVIOUSLY. CURIOUS HAS HELPED OUT A LOT IN EDUCATION. OF OF PHYSICIANS HAS HAS HELPED THAT. SO I WAS WONDERING THAT THE NUMBER OF OVERDOSES IS NOT. DECREASING. IT BUT IS THE NUMBER OF ARE THE NUMBER OF ILLEGAL DRUG OVERDOSES INCREASING FASTER THAN THE NUMBER OF. LEGAL PRESCRIPTION SERVES THE I'M SORRY I DON'T HAVE THE MOST RECENT DATA THOUGH IN THE NUMBER OF OVERDOSES IS IN FACTUALLY IN FACT IT'S IT'S DECREASING ALTHOUGH THE DECREASE IS NOT YET STOOD TO LIKELY SIGNIFICANT THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SEEING IT I'M FLAT ON THE GROUND SO IT IS SO. IT IS DECREASING. THERE PER BE NUMBER OF. OVERDOSES ASSOCIATED WITH HEROIN AND AND FENTON ALL ARE INCREASING THEY'RE STILL. UM'S STILL SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE OVERDOSES INDESIT WE SEE ARE RELATED TO PRESCRIPTION OPIOID SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT IS STILL THOUGH THE PREPONDERANCE OF OF THE PROBLEM RIGHT NOW. BUT WE DO EXPECT THAT PROPORTION TO SHIFT AS WE. IN GAY IT AS WE ARE MORE AND MORE SUCCESSFUL WITH THE PRESCRIBING COMMUNITY AND LIMITING. ACTUAL PRESCRIPTIONS A NEW ADDICTIONS THAT ALSO LIMITS THE DRUG AVAILABILITY FOR DIVERSION AND SO THAT WE HOPE THAT THAT WILL DECREASE THE OVERALL AMOUNT OF OF. OPIATES CIRCULATING IN A COMMUNITY BUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN ON THE EAST COAST IN PARTICULAR IS THAT. HEROIN COMES UP REALLY QUICKLY AND THAT'S THAT'S WHY WE NEED THAT PARTNERSHIP WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AS WELL AND BECAUSE THE INTERVENTIONS IN THAT WORLD AS FAR AS THAT. THE USER IS CONCERNED THE INTERVENTIONS ARE VERY SIMILAR IF NOT THE SAME BUT. IN TERMS OF DECREASING THE AMOUNT OF THAT THOSE DRUGS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO VERY DIFFERENT WORLD. RIGHT BUT IF AND IF YOU LOOK AT THAT CHART NO IT HAS BEEN VERY SIGNIFICANT IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS YEAH SO I WOULD I WOULD THINK THAT WE WOULD ALL BE PREDICTING A HUGE SPIKE IN AND HEROIN. YEAH AND SO IT SEEMS THAT THIS IS REALLY THE TIME TO THAT TO HAVE. A BIG FOCUS ON THESE ALTERNATIVE. STRATEGIES ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE YOU COULD GET A HOPEFULLY WE'RE GOING TO DO IS HAVE A CHART LIKE THE FRANCE CHART. IF YOU ARE ABLE TO OFFER OF AND YOU KNOW AS SOON AS THEY'RE OFF THE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. THE THE SUBOXONE OR THAT. METHADONE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE HOPING FOR GOING TO ABSOLUTE WE WE WANT TO AVOID THE CHALLENGES THAT WERE SEEN. ELSEWHERE IN THE UNITED STATES WHEN THEY DIDN'T RECOGNIZE THAT THIS WAS SHIFTING WE'VE KNOWN THAT FROM THE BEGINNING THAT THAT WAS A RISK AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HAVE THIS MULTI SECTOR COLLABORATIVE TO TRY TO. PUT ALL THOSE THINGS AND PLAY. YEAH I JUST SPOKE WITH THE MEDICAID DIRECTOR OF WEST VIRGINIA WITH THE HIGHEST DEATH RATE IN THE COUNTRY AND THEY'RE DOING AN ALL OUT LAW ENFORCEMENT APPROACH TO THE EPIDEMIC IN THEIR. IN THEIR DEATH RATE CONTINUES TO RISE IN THE WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THAT THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HATES A BOX UNDER THE SEAT SOLD ON THE STREET AND WHAT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND IS IT SOLD ON THE STREET BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET IT. LEGAL IS VERY DIFFICULT TO GET TREATMENT AND THERE'S IS INVERSE RELATIONSHIP AS THE MORE YOU MAKE IT EASIER TO GET TREATMENT THE LESS YOU NEED ADVICE ABOUT SOME ON THE STREET. BUT IT'S A REAL CULTURE SHIFT IN LAW ENFORCEMENT TO EMBRACE TREATMENT AND AND I JUST WANNA RECOGNIZE THAT THAT'S DIFFICULT AND AND. AYE AYES YEAH THEY DON'T SEEM TO LIKE THIS METHADONE EITHER BUT THEY'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THESE TRIALS WITH ON THIS PATROL. THAT THERE AND VENTURA COUNTY THEY'RE RUNNING A TRIAL RIGHT NOW YEAH I THINK THERE'S A ROLE FOR FOR ALL OF. THE TYPES OF OF ATTRITION AND PART OF THAT WE DO THINGS WE HAVE SEEN IN THE IN THE LOCAL COALITIONS. I WAS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BEFORE I CAME HERE AND WE HAD A COALITION IN AND. NAPA WHERE I WORKED AND. I'M IT WASN'T VERY LONG AFTER ENGAGING LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT THEY ACTUALLY BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMICS IN THAT STAND THE WHOLE PROBLEM MINISTRY FOR ALL OF US IF WE STAY IN OUR SILO AND THAT'S. ONE OF THE REASONS I I'M I'M PRETTY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT OUTCOMES AND IN LAW ENFORCEMENT IS A IS A PARTNER IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE LOCAL COALITION. AND IF I COULD DO ONE MORE STORY WE WENT TO GO VISIT REIKERS ISLAND IN RHODE ISLAND BECAUSE THEY OFFER METHADONE PEOPLE OFTEN END OF A TRIAL IN THE JAILS. AND PRISONS THERE AND THE MAIN REASON THEY DID THAT IS THEY FOUND A QUARTER OF THE PEOPLE WHO DIED IN RHODE ISLAND FROM OVERDOSE DEATHS. WERE WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF RELEASE FROM JAIL AND THE REASON IS YOU GO TO JAIL YOU GET DE TAXED YOU LOSE YOUR TOLERANCE YOU. GET RELEASED FROM JAIL. AND IF YOU GO BACK TO YOUR DREAD THEM OUT THEY USED TOLERATE IS NOW ENOUGH TO KILL YOU SO THERE'S A. REAL NATIONAL EFFORT TO GET ALL THREE MEDICATIONS INTO JAIL AND PRISON RE ENTRY TO PREVENT THOSE THOSE DEATHS. THE YOU MUCH WE HAVE A DOCTOR RAMBLER SOME BLOOM AND THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON. THANK YOU. COME I WANTED TO FOCUS MY COMMENTS OF A COULD DOCTOR PFEIFFER ON THE INTER OPERABILITY THAT YOU SPOKE OF WITH CURES AND QUIRK FLOW. HAVING WORKED WITH CURES ONE POINT NOW I KNOW THERE WERE QUITE SOME GROWING PAINS. AND WANTED TO SEE WHAT OPPORTUNITIES THERE WERE. REGARDING HIT BY AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WE HAVE TO WORK THROUGH ABOUT FIGURING OUT HOW ALERTS COULD HELP US TO TRIGGER. OR IF WE COULD GET YOU THE GAME INFORMATION JUST LIKE WE DO VITAL SIGNS I THINK IT'S AS IMPORTANT FOR US AS PRESCRIBERS. TO KNOW WHAT OUR PATIENTS ARE ON AND WOULD LIKE TO HEAR CREATIVE SOLUTIONS THAT YOU MAY SUGGEST TO HELP WITH WORK. WELL I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR PASSING AB FORTY BECAUSE IT USED TO BE IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AND NOW THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS ACTIVELY WORKING TO. REACH OUT TO ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD VENDORS AND SEE WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO MAKE THOSE CONNECTIONS SO NOW INSTEAD OF A POLICY PROBLEM IT'S A. IT'S A TECHNICAL AND RESOURCE PROBLEM JUST MAKING SURE THAT THEY'VE GOT THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO DO THE WORK TO MAKE THESE CONNECTIONS BECAUSE. IT'S IT'S THERE'S NO QUESTION IT WILL IMPROVE CARE AND AND YOU DON'T NEED TO MANDATE PRESCRIBERS TO CHECK IT IF IT'S FLOWS AND IT'S RIGHT THERE. IN YOUR FACE AND SO AGAIN I THINK THAT. I KNOW THEY'RE ACTIVELY WORKING ON IT AND WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO HELP IN ANY WAY WE CAN. YOU HAD ALSO MENTIONED THE PURE PROVIDERS AND THAT WAS A NEW TOPIC FOR ME CAN YOU EXTRAPOLATE A LITTLE BIT. WELL IT'S IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR SOMEONE IN THE THROES OF ADDICTION TO LISTEN TO WHITE MIDDLE AGED WOMAN TELL THEM. THEY CAN FEEL BETTER IT'S VERY IT'S A DIFFERENT EXPLAINS OF SOMEONE'S WALK THAT TALK TO SAY I'VE BEEN IN YOUR SHOES MY LIFE WAS CHAOS AND NOW EMPLOYED I'VE GOT MY FAMILY THAT YOU CAN DO THIS TOO AND SO. RHODE ISLAND FOR EXAMPLE HAD A STATEWIDE CAMPAIGN WHERE THEY MADE SURE EVERY SINGLE EMERGENCY ROOM. WAS ABLE TO GIVE SUBOXONE IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM SO YOU TAKE SOMEONE YOU KNOW THEY JUST OVERDOSE THEY'D GET MARK AND THEY'RE IN THE WORST WITHDRAW THEIR LIFE. AND WE GET MAD AT THEM WHEN THEY RUN OUT THE DOOR TO GET A FIX BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE GONNA DIE IF THEY GETS A BOX ON THEIR BRAIN STABLE AND THEN. APPEAR PROVIDERS ON CALL IN THEY'VE CREATED A NETWORK OF THESE PEER PROVIDERS WHO HAD SOME EDUCATION SO THAT THEY'RE NOT. AGAINST MEDICATIONS BECAUSE OF COURSE IF YOU'VE IF YOU'VE BECOME CLEAN AND SOBER WITHOUT MEDICATIONS AND THEN YOU CAN BE VERY JUDGMENTAL OF THOSE WHO NEED MEDICATIONS. AND SO THEY DIDN'T EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGNS OF THE NEW THE DATA THEY KNEW THAT YOU'RE TWICE AS LIKELY TO DIE WITH OPIATE ADDICTION IF YOU DON'T HAVE MEDICATIONS AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. AND SO THEY CREATED THIS THIRTY DAY INTERVENTION WHERE THE PEER PROVIDERS WILL BE CHECKING IN WITH AND THE NEXT DAY BY PHONE THE NEXT DAYS HAVE YOU GOTTEN DEDUCTION TRIMMING AND WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT AND. AND AGAIN THE MORE THAT SOMEONE LIKE YOU HELP SHOOTS THEM OR YOU'RE GOING TO RESPOND TO IT. FINALLY. IN YOUR COMMENTS HE SAID THAT SUBOXONE THAT CAN BE TRACKED BY CURES. THE FLIP OF THAT WOULD INFER THAT OTHER MEDICAL ASSISTANT TREATMENTS ARE NOT. TRACKED BY CURIOUS CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY THAT IS. SO S. DATABASE AND NOW TRACK SOUNDS NOT A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE AND SCARES DATABASE ONLY TRACKS CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES SO. WE DO THINK IT'S USEFUL IF IF WERE IF THE MESSAGES ALL THREE DRUGS SHOULD BE AVAILABLE IN ALL SETTINGS AND IF WE SEE PEOPLE OFTEN GO UP. WE CAN INFER THAT IT'S GOING UP IN OTHER WAYS WE HAVE TO USE OTHER DATA SOURCES TO UNDERSTAND. WHO'S GETTING METHADONE ENOUGH TRUCKS ON. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND THANK YOU FOR THE ELIMINATING PRESENTATION. AND I KNOW WE HAVE A BUNCH OF OTHER PRESENTATIONS ON WHICH I KEEP TO SUCK ON MY QUESTION TO A MINIMUM AND AND THAT IS. DO YOU HAVE DATA ERRORS ARE DATA AVAILABLE ON THE. OVERLAP BETWEEN HOMELESSNESS AND THE. OPIOID OVERDOSE. WE DO NOT HAVE A CLEAR. SOURCE OF DATA FOR THAT WE. OUR DON'T WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY TRIED TO. ASSESSED THAT SPECIFICALLY IT WOULD REQUIRE DATA SOURCES THAT ARE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. IN COMBINATION WITH THE RESOURCES AT TE STATE LEVEL AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE'VE WE'VE ATTEMPTED AT THIS POINT ALTHOUGH I BOTH YOU KNOW ANECDOTALLY IT'S OBVIOUSLY A HUGE OVERLAP FOR FOR THE CHRONIC. THE CHRONICALLY ADDICTED FOLKS. ALRIGHT THANK YOU. SOME AMERICAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M GOING% TO QUIT BECAUSE I KNOW WE HAVE OTHER PRESENTERS. I'M I'M INTERESTED IN THE AGE GROUP THAT YOU HAVE FOUND HAS BEEN THE MOST AT RISK IN TERMS OF THIS EPIDEMIC THAT'S ONE QUESTION. AND THEN TO. I CAN CERTAINLY APPRECIATE MY DOCTOR. DOCTOR RAMBLE AND OTHERS IN THIS FIELD WHO ARE EXPERTS CAN WE JUST STOP. PRESCRIBING. THIS DRUG. WHAT'S YOUR REACTION IS OR SOMETHING ELSE IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE OUT THERE. THAT WILL HAVE THE. LEASE KIND OF AFFECT. ON PEOPLE WITH THEY'LL CONTINUE TO FEED THIS ADDICTION. SO MANY DO THE LAST ONE FIRST IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN ENOUGH OPIOIDS ARE PRESCRIBED IN CALIFORNIA FOR EVERY MAN WOMAN AND CHILD TO MEDICATE THEMSELVES AROUND THE CLOCK FOR A MONTH. SO AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE'VE ALREADY GOT A GENERATION OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DEPENDENT ON THESE MEDICATIONS AND THEIR BRAIN HAS BEEN SOMETIMES PERMANENTLY ALTERED BY DEPENDENCE ON THIS MEDICATION SO FLEET WHAT WE FOUND IN INDIANA AND OTHER STATES AS YOU. SUDDENLY STOP PRESCRIBING THE DRUG YOU HAVE THE SAY EVEN IF YOU CAN TAKE IT FOR PAIN NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE ADDICTED YOUR TAKE IT LIKE A DOCTOR PRESCRIBED YOU GET THE SAME LEVEL OF. WITHDRAWAL AND CRAVING AND TECHNICALLY DOPE SICKNESS WHERE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE GONNA DIE. YOU IN ORDER TO SURVIVE HE TURNED TO STREET DRUGS THE TYPICAL PASSES HE START BUYING OXYCODONE THERE AND THEN YOU CAN'T AFFORD IT ANYMORE AND HEROINES CHEAPER AND SO INDIANA'S ARE REALLY BIG SPIKE IN HIV. BECAUSE OF MIDDLE CLASS. PEOPLE WHO WERE PROCLAIM PATIENTS WHO GOT CUT OFF SUDDENLY SO. I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO STOP PRESCRIBING THE DRUG EXCESSIVELY TO STOP PRESCRIBING AT HIGH DOSES TO STAB PRESCRIBING. FOR LONG DURATIONS. AND THAT TAKES A REAL CULTURE CHANGE FOR THE SAME TIME WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S AVAILABLE FOR TRAUMA AND CANCER AND END OF LIFE CARE. AND WE WANNA MAKE SURE PEOPLE WHO ARE DEPENDENT ON HIGH DOSES ARE SLOWLY TAPERED TO A SAFER LOWER DOSES WITHOUT BEING CUT OFF BECAUSE THAT WILL ONLY INCREASE THE DEATH RATE. I'D SAY THE FIRST QUESTION WAS ALL AGES WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT IT THE. IT'S A MUCH YOUNGER PROFILE THAN ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO. THESE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE DYING IN THE FIRST COUPLE YEARS OF THEIR DICTION SO WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF DUST IN THEIR TWENTIES AND WE'RE ALSO SEEING. EARLY MIDDLE AGE BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE FOLKS WHO. HAVE CHRONIC PAIN A LOT OF THEM ARE WORKING CLASS DID MANUAL LABOR THAT SPINE INJURIES WENT TO THE DOCTOR. DIET PILLS AND THEN GOT DEPEND ON BECAME DEPENDENT ON THOSE PILLS SO I AM THAT'S WHY WE'VE ULTIMATELY. SHIFTED THE LIFE EXPECTANCY IN THE U. S. BECAUSE THESE THESE FOLKS ARE DYING AT YOUNGER AGES. THANK YOU BUT THE DETAILS ARE IN THE DASHBOARD AND IT'S REALLY FUN TO PLAY AN ENCOURAGE YOU TO GO IN AND LOOK BY AGING REGION THAT CAUSES A LOT OF INFORMATION. THANK YOU. THIRTY FIVE AND DOCTOR SMITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT THIS TIME THAT HE'S BEEN FESTIVE TODAY. THANK YOU WELL NOW I TRANSITION INTO OUR SECOND PANEL IN WHICH WE HAVE OF FOR REPRESENTATIVES. MISS TINA FOR ALL IS WHO WORKS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TECHNOLOGY DIVISION WHICH MAINTAINS THE CURES PROGRAM. ALSO MISTER BRIAN CLIFFORD WHO REPRESENTS THE DEPARTMENT A CONSUMER AFFAIRS.

AND FINALLY MISS KIMBERLY KURT MEYER THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD WHICH ALSO REGULATES DOCTORS WHO. OVERSEE AND. USED CURES. SO WITH THAT. PLEASE WERE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY WHOEVER'S LIKE OF THIS HOW WOULD YOU CARE TO TO BE IT OR DO YOU. HAVE ANYONE IN PARTICULAR MISSED MISS ROBBINS. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING.

MY NAME IS JENNIFER ALISON I AM THE MANAGER OF THE CURE'S PROGRAM. AND WITH ME OF MY COLLEAGUE SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MELANIE. BONTA THREE NEAR. CURIOUS NOW FOR CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE UTILIZATION REVIEW AND EVALUATION SYSTEM. I'M OBLIGATED TO SAY THAT EVERY TIME I FOR THAN TWENTY YEARS. CREATED IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE CALIFORNIA'S PMP OF THE OLDEST IN THE COUNTRY. ORIGINALLY THE TRIPLICATE PRESCRIPTION PROGRAM OR TPP. ONLY FILL TWO DISPENSATIONS REPORTED TO DOJ AND MADE AVAILABLE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT SURFACED IN INVESTIGATIONS OF CRIMINAL DRUG DIVERSION AND FRIED. IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE CURES REPLACE THE TPP AND BECAME PERMANENT. DURING THE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN STATE BUDGET CRISIS DOJ'S BUREAU OF NARCOTIC ENFORCEMENT WHICH MAINTAIN THE CURE'S PROGRAM. DISSOLVED AND ACUTE PROGRAM WITH LEFT COMPLETELY DEFUNDED. EVENTUALLY IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THE STATE BUDGET ACT ALLOCATED FUNDS SPECIFICALLY FOR THE NEW CARE SYSTEM BUILT PROJECT. ALSO IN TWENTY THIRTEEN SENATE BILL EIGHT ON NINE ESTABLISH THE REQUIREMENT FOR PRESCRIBER THAN DISPENSERS TO REGISTER FOR CURIOUS BY TWENTY SIXTEEN. THE BILL ALSO CREATED AN ONGOING FUNDING MECHANISM TO SUPPORT THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF THE CARE SYSTEM. THROUGH THE COLLECTION OF A FIXED DOLLAR ANNUAL FEE PROFESSED HIGH LIFE AND SEE THAT THE TIME OF LICENSE RENEWAL. THE PROCEEDS ARE DEPOSITED INTO THE CURE FUND. FOR THE DEPARTMENT CAN THOROUGHFARES TO REIMBURSE DOJ FOR MAINTAINING THE CURRENT DATABASE. TO THIS END DEAR JANE DE CA HAVE A FORMALIZED WORKING PARTNERSHIP. THE DOJ IN DC MEET REGULARLY TO DISCUSS CURIOUS TO POINT NO UPDATES AND CURES TO POINT A CHANGE CONTROL BOARD MATTER TH. AND TWENTY SIXTEEN IS WHEN THE CURIOUS TO POINT OF SYSTEM WENT LIVE. SO WHAT INFORMATION IS CONTAINED IN CURIOUS. PHARMACY THE DISPENSERS ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT THEIR DISPENSATIONS OF SCHEDULE TWO TO FOUR PRESCRIPTIONS TO DOJ AT LEAST WEEKLY. SINCE THE PHARMACY AND DISPENSER CREATE AN OWNS A PRESCRIPTION RECORD THE CURE SYSTEM THEREFORE REFLECTS THAT INFORMATION EXACTLY AT THAT HAVE REPORTED TO DOJ. ONE OF THE BENEFITS FOR PROVIDERS CHECKING CURIOUS THAT THEY CAN. GET A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF THAT THEIR PATIENT'S PRESCRIPTION HISTORY. INCLUDING THOSE PRESCRIPTIONS THAT TOOK PLACE OUTSIDE OF THE PROVIDER OF NETWORK OR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. TO GIVE ME AN IDEA OF HOW MANY PRESCRIPTIONS ARE DISPENSED IN CALIFORNIA. GROUP RECEIVES ABOUT A MILLION PRESCRIPTION RECORDS EACH WEEK. THOUGH THE AUTHOR WRITES ACCESS CURES INCLUDE PRESCRIBERS DEFEND THIRDS LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS REGULATORY. BOARD OFFICIALS AS WELL. DATA CAN ALSO BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR STATISTICAL ANALYSIS EDUCATION AND RESEARCH. THIS GRAPH REPRESENTS CURED REGISTRATION AND APPROVAL RATE. THE RED VERTICAL LINE REPRESENTING CURE SOPRANO WENT LIVE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. AND THE BLACK VERTICAL LINE REPRESENTS WHEN THE MANDATORY REGISTRATION DEADLINE WAS AND IN JULY TWENTY SIXTEEN. PROGRAMMER DISPENSARY JUST RATIONS REPRESENTED BY THE ORANGE AND YELLOW LINES ON THIS CHART SHOW A GRADUAL INCREASE IN REGISTRATION FIFTH ENACTMENT OF SENATE BILL EIGHT OR NINE. WHEN TH CURIOUS TO POINT NO LAUNCHED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN OF THE FULLY AUTOMATED REGISTRATION PROCESS. DID THE HEAVY LIFTING IN GETTING THE MAJORITY PRESCRIBER THAN DISPENSERS REGISTERED BY THE DEADLINE. IN TWENTY ELEVEN THE NUMBER PRESCRIBE WITH REGISTERED WITH ABOUT FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED AND BY TWENTY SEVENTEEN THERE WERE OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND PRESCRIBERS REGISTERED IN HERE IF. FOR DISPENSER THAN TWENTY ELEVEN THERE ARE JUST UNDER THOUSAND DISPENSERS REGISTERED AND BY TWENTY SEVENTEEN THERE OVER FORTY THOUSAND DISPENSERS REGISTERED. THE BLUE AND GREEN LINE AT THE BOTTOM REPRESENTS LONG FOURTH MINUTE AND REGULATORY BOARD REGISTRATIONS. THE FIVE OF THE BOTTOM RATHER DIFFICULT THE MAINLY BECAUSE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND REGULATORY BOARD REGISTRATIONS ARE LOW IN COMPARISON TO THE PRESCRIBER THEN THE FENCERS. IN TWENTY ELEVEN THERE WERE ABUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS REGISTERED AND BY TWENTY SEVENTEEN THERE ARE FOURTEEN HUNDRED. FOR REGULATORY OFFICIALS IN TWENTY ELEVEN THERE WERE THERE WERE ROUGHLY TEN AND BY TWENTY FIFTEEN THERE WERE NINETY. THIS GRAPH REPRESENTS CURED UTILIZATION LEVELS. DURING TWENTY ELEVEN THE NUMBER OF PATIENT ACTIVITY REPORTS THAT WERE GENERATED BY PRESCRIBERS WITH THAT ABOUT FIFTEEN AND FORTY FIVE THOUSAND. MY TWENTY SEVENTEEN PRESCRIBERS GENERATED OVER FOUR MILLION PATIENT ACTIVITY REPORTS ARE PART IN THAT YEAR. IN TWENTY ELEVEN THE NUMBER OF PARS GENERATED BY DISPENSERS WITH ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE THOUSAND. AND BY TWENTY SEVENTEEN DISPENSERS GENERATED ABOUT FIVE POINT EIGHT MILLION PARTISAN THAT YEAR. RELATIVE TO PRESCRIBER THAN DEFEND THROUGH IF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND REGULATORY BOARD USAGE IS LOW MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENCE IN THE NUMBER OF REGISTRANTS. BUT TO PROVIDE YOU WITH THE THOUGHT OF HOW MANY PATIENT ACTIVITY REPORTS WERE CREATED. IN TWENTY ELEVEN THE NUMBER PART BY LAW ENFORCEMENT THERE WERE ABOUT TEN THOUSAND CREATED. AND BY TWENTY SEVENTEEN THERE ARE TWO THOUSAND. FOR REGULATORY BUT OFFICIALS IN TWENTY ELEVEN THE CREATED ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED PARTS IN MY TWENTY SEVENTEEN. OVER SIX THOUSAND PARTH. ONE FOURTH MINUTE REGULATORY BOARD USERS ARE AUTHORIZED TO ACCESS NOT ONLY PART OF BUT THE CAN OBTAIN PRESCRIBER AND. PRESCRIPTION REPORTS. THERE ARE SOME NOTABLE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CAPABILITIES OF CARE OF ONE POINT NOW ENSURES TO PLANO. YOU'RE GOING POINT WITHOUT DEADLINE FOR FLEXIBILITY AND SCALABILITY. GIVEN PLANO ALSO LACKED ANALYTIC AND COULD NOT SUPPORT ACADEMIC RESEARCH OR PUBLIC HEALTH SECTOR DATING YOUTH. YOUR TWO POINT ADDRESSES THESE INADEQUACIES BY PROVIDING AN IMPROVED USER INTERFACE ROBUST PERFORMANCE. ANALYTICS AND INNOVATIVE PMP INFORMATIONAL FEATURES. ONE OF THE NEW FEATURES OF CURES TO POINT OUR THE A FULLY AUTOMATED REGISTRATION PROCESS FOR CALIFORNIA LICENSE PRESCRIBER THAN DEFENSE EARTH. SINCE GOING LIVE WITH CURIOUS TO POINT OUT OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND YOU CURIOUS USERS HAVE BEEN APPROVED FOR ACCESS. ANOTHER KEY STOOD ON A FEATURE. PROVIDES PRESCRIBER THE DEFENSE THROUGH THE ABILITY TO DESIGNATE OTHER TH OR OR DELEGATES TO INITIATE PATIENT INCREASE ON THEIR BEHALF. SINCE MAKING THIS DELEGATE FEATURE AVAILABLE OVER THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DELEGATE INITIATED PARTS OF BEEN CREATED. YOUR SUPPORT ALSO LOVE PRESCRIBERS TO NOTATE THEIR PATIENTS WITH WHOM THEY HAVE A TREATMENT EXCLUSIVITY COMPACT. PATIENTS WITH COMPACT ARE TYPICALLY BEING TREATED FOR CHRONIC PAIN. WHEN PRESCRIBING ZEOLITE THIS FEATURE FILTERS USERS CAN VIEW OF A COMPACT OF THIS FOR THE PATIENT. WHICH MAY THINK WE'LL TO THOSE PROVIDERS THAT ADDITIONAL PRESCRIBING TO THESE PATIENTS CAN BE POTENTIALLY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO THEIR EXISTING TREATMENT. PRESCRIBER THE DISPENSER CAN ALSO SECURELY FUND MESSAGES CONCERNING MUTUAL PATIENTS. MESSAGES DO NOT GET BENT OUT TO PERSONAL EMAIL ACCOUNTS RATHER THESE MESSAGES ARE SENT WITHIN THE CURIOUS TO POINT NO ENVIRONMENT. A CURATIVE* ENVIRONMENT. SO SO THE OTHER HAVE TO LOG INTO THE CURE THE COUNT IN ORDER TO VIEW AND VENDOR THESE MESSAGES. WE THINK YOU'RE IS TO POINT OUT PATIENT SAFETY ALERT FOR DELIVERY TO PRESCRIBERS DAILY. THESE ALERTS ARE INFORMATIONAL AND CAN ASSIST THE PRESCRIBER IN ABSOLUTE APTLY DETERMINING PATIENT TREATMENT. AND THE OTHER A FIVE PATIENT SAFETY ALERT THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE FOR PRESCRIBERS. NEW ALERTS ARE GENERATED DAILY AND PREVENTED TO PRESCRIBERS WITH THEM THE CURES TO PLANO ACCOUNTS DASHBOARD. WHEN CHALLENGE OF PRESCRIPTION DATA IS THAT THE INFORMATION EXCLUDES UNIQUE POSITIVE IDENTIFIERS. THE PATIENT EVER AND FROM. GIVE ME THE PATIENT LEVEL INFORMATION CURED RECEIVE. THE LIMITED TO THE PATIENT NAME DATE OF BIRTH GENDER AND ADDRESS. FREQUENTLY INFORMATION FOR A SINGLE PERSON MAY DIFFER ACROSS OR MULTIPLE PRESCRIPTIONS BECAUSE THE VARIATIONS IN THEIR NAME OR NAME SPELLING OR THE PERSON LOOK AT MULTIPLE ADDRESSES. OR BECAUSE THE SIMPLE TYPE OF BY THE REPORTING PHARMACY. IN ORDER FOR CURIOUS TO PRODUCE PATIENT SAFETY ALERTS THE ANALYTICS ENGINE DE DUPLICATE THE DATA WHICH WILL MATCH RECORDS CONSIDERING VARIATIONS ON PATIENT LEVEL INFORMATION. FOR EXAMPLE. JOHN SMITH BELLAGIO H. AND. COULD BE CONSIDERED THE FAME PERSON AT THE JOHN SMITH BILL J. O. N.. THIS PROCESS OF LINKING ALL OF THE RIGHT JOHN SMITH VARIATIONS TOGETHER IF CALLED DEDUPLICATION. OR PATIENT ENTITY REVOLUTION. THE CURIOUS DE DUPLICATION PROCESS CONSIDER THE VARIATIONS IN DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF NAME DATE OF BIRTH STREET ADDRESS FITTING IN THAT CODE. CURATOR STEVE APPROXIMATELY HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND YOU PRESCRIPTION RECORD EACH DAY. SO ALL OF THESE NEW PATIENT PRESCRIPTION RECORDS WILL BE DE DUPLICATED OR INVOLVED EVERY NIGHT AGAINST THE ALREADY THE STING DATING CURES. PRIOR TO FURTHER SYSTEM ANALYTIC PROPHECIES THAT LEAD TO THE ALERTS CREATION. ONCE THE NIGHTLY DE DUPLICATION PROCESS IS COMPLETE CALCULATIONS AGAINST THE REVOLVED PERSONS CURRENT PRESCRIPTION DATA IF CALCULATED AND WENT APPLICABLES. THE PATIENT SAFETY ALERT IS DELIVERED TO THAT PERSON'S CURRENT PRESCRIBERS. THE SYSTEM GENERATES APPROXIMATELY TURN A FIFTY THOUSAND YOU PATIENT ALERTS EACH DAY. DE DUPLICATION OF ALSO PERFORMED DURING THE PRODUCTION OF DE IDENTIFIED DATA SETS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICES AND RESEARCHERS. ON A QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL BASIS CURES TO PLANO CAN NOW SYSTEMATICALLY PRODUCE. WHEN STATEWIDE AND FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY SPECIFIC DE IDENTIFIED DATA SETS. THE COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICES THAT HAVE RECEIVED IF DATA STATE PICURIS HAS HELPED WITH. INCREASING PROVIDER COMMUNITY AWARENESS OF THE LOCAL OPIOID ISSUES. HELP TARGET PREVENTION AND EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS TO CHANGE PRESCRIBING BEHAVIOR AND THEN MEASURE OF SUCCESS OF SUCH INITIATIVES. AND HELP INFLUENCE PRESCRIBING GUIDELINES AND DRIVE LOCAL HEALTH POLICY. DOJ ALSO CONTRIBUTES CURIOUS DE IDENTIFIED DATA TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. WELL BEARD OVERDOSE SURVEILLANCE DASHBOARD. DE IDENTIFIED DATA HAVE ALSO PROVIDED TO FEDERALLY SPONSORED. PRESCRIPTION BEHAVIOR SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM OR PDFS PROJECT. WHICH IS CONDUCTED AT BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY. THE GOAL OF PBS AT THIS TO CREATE AN EARLY WARNING SURVEILLANCE EVALUATION TOOL BASED ON DE IDENTIFIED LONGITUDINAL DATA FROM ST PETE IMPIOUS. LIST TO LIVE INTENDED TO MEASURE TRENTON CONTROL SORT OF PRESCRIBING A DEFENSE THING AS OLIVE INDICATOR THE MEDICAL USE IMPOSSIBLE NON MEDICAL PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE AND DIVERSION. CALIFORNIA'S ONE OF ELEVEN STATES THAT CONTRIBUTE DE IDENTIFIED PMP DATA TO THIS PROJECT. WITH SPECIFIED EXCEPTIONS SENATE BILL FORTY TWO REQUIRED PRESCRIBER CSUS CONSULT HERE OF PRIOR TO PRESCRIBING A SCHEDULE TWO TO FOUR CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE. AND AT LEAST ONCE EVERY FOUR MONTHS OF THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE CONTINUES TO BE PART OF THE PATIENT'S TREATMENT. THIS MANDATORY CURIOUS CHECK WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE SIX MONTH AFTER DOJ CERTIFY SYSTEM PROGRAM RIGHT ENOUGH. OTHER JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE CURE PROGRAM COMPLETED HIRING RESOURCES THAT WILL BE DEDICATED TO THIS EFFORT. AND THE CURE APPLICATION TEAM IS CURRENTLY CONDUCTING SYSTEM IN THE TESTING AND ONCE IT IS COMPLETE THE TO. THE DEPARTMENT WILL CERTIFY THE SYSTEM. A SIMILAR BEEF ASSEMBLY BILL FORTY REQUIRED DJ TO MAKE YOUR DATA AVAILABLE TO OPERATE THE THIRDS VIA INTEGRATION WITH HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS BY OCTOBER ONE TWENTY EIGHTEEN. ONCE IMPLEMENTED CURE THE FIFTH ABILITY WILL BE GREAT WILL GREATLY IMPROVE. ACCESS TO THE HEALTHCARE COMMUNITY. DOJ THEM EARLY STAGE OF THE DEVELOPING THE TECHNICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECT OF AB FORTY. AND PLANS TO. MOVE FORWARD WITH TIME COLLECTING INFORMATION AND I'M DEVELOPING THE SOLUTION BY OCTOBER ONE. THIS CONCLUDES. ARE CURIOUS PROGRAM OVERVIEW ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PREVENT INFORMATION ON THE CURE IS TO POINT OUT SYSTEM. YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME. GOOD MORNING CHAIR LOAN ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MY NAME IS BRIAN CLIFFORD AND I AM THE SENIOR PLANNING IMPLEMENTATION MANAGER AT THE DEPARTMENT CONSUMER AFFAIRS. IN MY ROLE AS SERVE AS A CENTRAL POINT OF CONTACT AT DCA FOR OUR BOARDS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE REGARDING HERE'S. I'VE BEEN ASKED TO SPEAK TODAY ABOUT THE ROLE DE CA IN OUR RELATIONSHIP. WITH THE BOARDS AND DOJ. IN IN IMPLEMENTING CURES TO DATA. BRIEFLY FOR BACKGROUND ON DCA THERE ARE THIRTY EIGHT BOARDS AND BUREAUS UNDER THE DEPARTMENT BUT ONLY TEN BOARDS LICENSE AND REGULATE THOSE INDIVIDUALS. THAT MAY PRESCRIBE DISPENSE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. DC AS ROLE IN REGARDS SECURES IS THREEFOLD. FIRST WE SUPPORT DOJ AND A TECHNICAL CAPACITY TO CONFIRM THAT ACCESS SHOULD BE GRANTED TO A LICENSED PRACTITIONER. AUTHORIZED PRESCRIBER DISPENSE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. WE DO THIS THROUGH DAILY AND MONTHLY DATA EXCHANGES WITH DOJ TO VALIDATE APPLICANT INFORMATION AND CONFIRM THAT AN INDIVIDUAL REQUESTING ACCESS HAS AN ACTIVE LICENSE. WE ALSO SYSTEM TROUBLESHOOTING PROBLEMS SUCH AS LOGGING ISSUES AND MANY REPORTS BROUGHT FORWARD BY OUR USERS AT THE BOARDS. SECOND DCA ADMINISTERS SECURES FUND AND PAYS REIMBURSEMENTS TO DOJ FOR THE CURE SYSTEM. LICENSEES THAT CAN PRESCRIBE DISPENSE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ARE REQUIRED TO PAY AN ANNUAL FEE OF SIX DOLLARS AT THE TIME OF THEIR LICENSE RENEWAL. AND THAT MONEY IS DEPOSITED INTO DC'S CURES FUND. DOJ THEN PROVIDES INVOICES TO DCA DETAILING WHAT COSTS SHOULD BE REIMBURSED BY THE CURES FUND. INCLUDING PERSONNEL AND ONGOING SYSTEM MAINTENANCE COSTS. FINALL IN ADDITION TO BOARD STAFF USERS THERE IS ALSO STAFF AT DC WHO DO YOU LAST YEAR'S. THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE INVESTIGATORS IN THE DEPARTMENT'S DIVISION OF THE VESTED NATION AND RANCHERS REPORTS IN THE COURSE OF INVESTIGATING COMPLAINTS THAT HAVE BEEN REFERRED BY OUR PORTS. CASES INVOLVING DRUG VERSION ARE GIVEN HIGH PRIORITY BY THE DIVISION. UNDER ITS CONSUMER PROTECTION ENFORCEMENT INITIATIVE GUIDELINES. WELL DOJ CONTROLS AND OPERATES CURES. DC EIGHT ITS BOARDS ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE INPUT INTO DECISION MAKINGTHROUGH THE CURES CHANGE CONTROL BOARD. THE CHANGE CONTROL BORDER CCB IS A GROUP OF SIX INDIVIDUALS COMPRISED OF DOJ DE CA. AND BOARD EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN ITS QUARTERLY TO REVIEW STEERING ITEMS SUCH AS STAFFING EXPENDITURES. CHANGE REQUESTING USER DATA. THE TYPES OF USER DATA CURRENTLY REVIEWED INCLUDES THE NUMBER OF REGISTRANTS THE NUMBER OR THE NUMBER OF REPORTS RUN. AND THE NUMBER OF TIMES A SYSTEM WAS ACCESS. FOLLOWING THE LAUNCH APPEARS TO OUT OF THIS GROUP WAS AGREED TO BY ALL AGENCIES INVOLVED WHO THE INTERAGENCY AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CIA AND DOJ. REGARDING THE ONGOING MAINTENANCE AND OPERATION OF CURES. STAFF FROM DCA DOJ IN THE BOARDS ALSO MEET MONTHLY TO DISCUSS TECHNICAL ISSUES SUCH AS USER QUESTIONS REPORT CHANGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRAINING. THESE MEETINGS PROVIDE VALUABLE AVENUES OF COMMUNICATION FOR DE CA TO ELEVATE ISSUES AND WORK WITH DOJ TO EVALUATE OPTIONS FOR RESOLUTION. DC ALSO FACILITATES REGULAR MEETINGS WITH ITS EXECUTIVE OFFICERS INVOLVED WITH CURES. TO SHARE INFORMATION AND RECEIVE FEEDBACK ON THE USE OF THE SYSTEMS AND THE ISSUES THEY ARE FACING. AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN D. C. BEGAN HOSTING THE USER GROUP TO HELP BRING TOGETHER PRIMARY STAFF USERS AT THE BOARDS. DISCUSS REPORTS AND FUNCTIONALITY AVAILABLE IN THE SYSTEM AS WELL AS TRAINING NEEDS. DOJ HAS PARTICIPATED IN THESE MEETINGS AND ASSIST IN PROVIDING TRAININGS AND WALKTHROUGHS OF THE SYSTEM. THROUGH THESE EFFORTS DCA SEEKS TO DO WHATEVER I CAN TO SUPPORT THE BOARDS AND ASSIST IN ADDRESSING THE ISSUES THEY MAY HAVE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND PROTECTING CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS IN MY HOUSE. TO BE MUCH. GOOD MORNING. ASSEMBLY BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS COMMITTEE MY NAME'S VIRGINIA HEROLD ON THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER THE BORDER PROMISE. PHARMACY IS GROUND ZERO AND ALL OF THIS MASS AND WE'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH OPIOID ABUSE AND SPECIFICALLY WITH CHARIS FOR YEARS. WE WE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAVE A LONG HISTORY IN THIS AREA GOING BACK BEFORE THESE PEOPLE WHERE THERE ARE. CONSIDERABLY OLDER UNTIL I'D BEEN AROUND FOR EVER. AS YOU CAN TELL. AND I CAN'T TAKE A PAPER CLIP OFF MY PACKET. I'M I'M GOING TO TALK BRIEFLY. ABOUT WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING WITH RESPECT HERE'S HOW INVALUABLE IT IS TO THE PRACTICE OF PHARMACY AND HOW WE REQUIRE PHARMACISTS TO REALLY RELY ON THE INFORMATION IN CARES TO MAKE JUDGMENTS WHEN THEY HAVE A PATIENT IN FRONT OF THEM. ESPECIALLY PATIENT THEY'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH. BEFORE I GET STARTED HOWEVER I NEED TO. STATE THAT THE BOARD MANDATE THIS CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SPECIFICALLY PROTECTION OF PUBLIC AND. WE START ALL PRESENTATIONS WITH THAT PARTICULAR AFFIRMATION OF WHY WE'RE HERE. I'M JUST REAL QUICKLY THE BOARD LICENSES A HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND DIFFERENT LICENSEES IN DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND WE LICENSE INDIVIDUALS WITH LICENSE FIRMS. AND WE LICENSE THE PRODUCT ITSELF SO WE PRETTY MUCH HAVE A FULLY INTEGRATED SHOP. ON WE GO INSIDE AND OUTSIDE CALIFORNIA WITH RESPECT TO OUR ON INSPECTIONS BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF SOME OF THE ON PUBLIC PROTECTION ISSUES INVOLVED. SO WE HAVE FORTY FIVE THOUSAND PHARMACISTS ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND PHARMACIES IN CALIFORNIA SIXTY SIX HUNDRED OF THEM ARE COMMUNITY PHARMACIES WHICH LOOKED COMMUNITY. PHARMACY ON THE CORNER THAT YOU THINK ABOUT WE ALSO REGULATE WHOLESALERS WHICH WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT TODAY BUT IT IS THE WHOLESALERS THAT SHIP THE DRUGS FROM THE MANUFACTURE. TWO THE PHARMACIES AND THEY ARE ALSO PART OF THIS MESS WITH US. DOCTOR STEPHEN HENRY IS IN THE AUDIENCE AND IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN HE CONDUCTED A SURVEY OF PHARMACISTS AND CONCLUSIONS FOR THEIR OPINIONS ON CURIOUS. AND SO I'M GONNA RUN RUN THROUGH A SERIES OF FINDINGS FROM THAT IT'S JUST GOING TO BE REAL FAST. AND IF YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH SOMEBODY JUST TELL ME TO STOP BUT I'M NOT I PROMISE THERE AREN'T THAT MANY OF THEM BUT THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT. OKAY SO THE SURVEY. WAS COMPLETED HOME ABOUT A YEAR AGO COMPLETED THE RESULTS IN SEPTEMBER THEY WERE DOING IT ABOUT A YEAR AGO. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT TWENTY THREE PERCENT OF THOSE REGISTERED IN ON CURES. AND ARE PROVIDING INFORMATION INTO THE CARE SYSTEM OUR PHARMACISTS BUT YET. SIXTY PERCENT OF THE REPORTS PULLED OUT OF CURES ARE BEING PULLED BY PHARMACISTS. SO WE HAVE MADE AT LEAST A PIVOTAL IN A VERY IMPORTANT STEP IN CONVINCING OUR LICENSEES TO RELY ON THE SYSTEM. AS A DECISION MAKING STEP IN PROVIDING CARE TO THEIR PATIENTS. COP PHARMACISTS GENERALLY HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE AND MAKES BEST EXPRESSED JUST GREATER SENSE OF PROFESSIONAL OBLIGATION TO USE CURES AND THAT'S BORNE OUT IN THE DATA I JUST PROVIDED WITH YOU. PHARMACIST LISTED INFORMATION FROM TEARS AS THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR CHANGES IN THEIR DISPENSING PATTERNS. SO AGAIN AND THE SHORT FEW YEARS THAT PHARMACIES HAVE REALLY BEEN ACCESSING CURES WE'VE SEEN I'M I DEMONSTRATED DIFFERENCE THERE. NEARLY ALL PHARMACISTS REPORTED THEY'D HEARD OF CURES WHICH IS GOOD SO THERE'S ANY THERE'S. IDENTIFICATION BESIDES THAT THEY ALL HAVE TO BE REGISTERED IF THEY HAVE AN ACTIVE LICENSE EVEN IF THEY'RE OUTSIDE CALIFORNIA THE REQUIRED. REGISTERED. AMONG RESPONDENTS WHO WERE REQUIRED TO REGISTER PICTURES NINETY SIX PERCENT OF THE PHARMACIST REPORTED THEY WERE REGISTERED ARE IN THE PROCESS OF REGISTERING FOR CHARIS. KEEP IN MIND THIS SURVEY WENT BACK TO NOVEMBER OF TWO THOUSANDS. SEVENTEEN WHICH WAS SIX MONTHS RIGHT AFTER THAT DROP DEAD DEADLINE. SO. THEY SHOULD HAVE ALL BEEN THERE SO. PERHAPS WE HAVE MORE EDUCATION. WHEN ASKED WHETHER THEY FELT THEY NEEDED ADDITIONAL TRAINING EDUCAR IN EDUCATION ABOUT CURES FORTY PERCENT OF THE RISK PHARMACIST RESPONDED AFFIRMATIVELY. SO THEY'RE NOT USING IT FOR MORE THAN JUST CLEAN A SINGLE PATIENT REPORT ONE AT A TIME SOMETIMES. AND I THINK THE SUBSCRIBER ALERTS AND SOME OF THE NOTIFICATIONS ARE INTEGRAL PARTS OF THE NEW SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE NOT HELPED OUR PROFESSION. ON ACCESSING UP AND SO WITH THAT WE'LL BE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO HELP IMPROVE THAT. A SENSE FINANCIAL MAJORITY OF PHYSICIANS AND PHARMACISTS AND PHARMACIST HAD THIS AT NINETY ONE PERCENT AGREED THAT THEIR COLLEAGUES SHOULD BE USING CARES BEFORE THEY DISPENSE. SO MAYBETHEY DON'T DO IT THEMSELVES BUT THEY THINK THEY'RE COLLEAGUES SHOULD BE DOING THAT. AND THEN THIRTY NINE PERCENT A PHARMACIST SUPPORTED MANDATORY CURES FOR THEIR COLLEAGUES. SO THE END RESULT IN THERE SOME ADDITIONAL ONES BUT IN THE INTEREST OF TIME TO GET THE OTHER PANELISTS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. THE SURVEY RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ACCESS TO CURES HAS A MAJOR IMPACT ON PHARMACISTS DISPENSING. PRACTICES THAT INCREASE PROFESSIONAL AWARENESS OF RISK AND BENEFITS PLAYS A MAJOR ROLE IN DECREASED PRESCRIBING AND DISPENSING FOR BOTH PHYSICIANS AND PHARMACISTS AND FINALLY THE SURVEY RESULTS INDICATE THE PHARMACIST. HAVE PRETTY NEAR COME PERFECT COMPLIANCE WITH MANDATORY CURES REGISTRATION. SO. I AM NOW GOING TO GO BACK TO A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS WE'VE BEEN DOING. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE VALUE OF CURES FIRST YOU HEARD ON THIS FOR ALICE SPEAK ABOUT SIX. PRESCRIBERS. SIX PHARMACIES IN SIX MONTHS. LET'S LET ME TALK ABOUT. SOME OF THE STARK HORROR STORIES THAT WE'VE GOT. IN A FOUR YEAR PERIOD THAT PERIOD WE HAVE ONE PATIENT IN THIS IS FROM THE BOREDOM DESICCATION. WE FOUND FOR DIFFERENT PATIENTS WITH OBSCENELY HIGH DRUG USAGE. THIS IS WHAT A DOCTOR SHOPPER LOOKS LIKE IN A FOUR YEAR PERIOD PERIOD A PATIENT OBTAIN SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX PRESCRIPTIONS FOR VARIOUS CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES THERE WERE OVER TWENTY FIVE DIFFERENT CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES THAT WERE PRESCRIBED. THE PATIENT SAW HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN POSITIONS OVER THAT FOUR YEAR PERIOD INCLUDING DENNIS POSITION ASSISTANCE AND FARM AND POSITIONS. THE PATIENT SOFT FIFTY EIGHT PRESCRIBERS AND OBTAINED ONLY A SINGLE PRINT PRESCRIPTION FROM FIFTY EIGHT SO THAT TURNS OUT EXACTLY HALF OF THOSE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN ONLY WROTE ONE PRESCRIPTION. FOR THIS PATIENT THE PATIENT MAY HAVE NOT GOTTEN EVERYTHING THAT SHE WANTED IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE AND THEN WENT ON TO PLAYING THE OTHER ONCE. THE PATIENTS YOU SEVENTY SIX PHARMACIES TO BUILD THE PRESCRIPTIONS WHICH HAS A LOT OF WORK. AND SEVENTEEN PHARMACIES FILLED MORE THAN ON FIFTEEN PRESCRIPTIONS OF THIS PATIENTS OVER THE FOUR YEARS. FIFTEEN PHARMACIES BILL BETWEEN FIVE AND TEN WHICH WITH MODERATE USE AND FORTY FOUR PERCENT FEWER KILLED BICU FOUR OR FEWER. KEEP IN MIND WE'RE TALKING NOW SIX HUNDRED THIRTY SIX PRESCRIPTIONS TWENTY FIVE CONTROLLED. SUBSTANCES A HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN PRESCRIBERS. AND DURING THAT PERIOD THE PHARMACIES ACCORDING TO CURES DISPENSED FORTY FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY THREE DOSES. OF THOSE THE WERE ALMOST TWELVE THOUSAND HYDROCODONE DOSES. THERE WERE SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED MORPHINE SULFATE DOSES. SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED HYDROMORPHONE. DOSES THREE THOUSAND OXYCODONE DOSES TWENTY SIX HUNDRED ALPRAZOLAM. AND FOURTEEN HUNDRED SOMA. THAT'S ONLY FIFTY PERCENT WHAT I JUST READ OFF OF THE FORTY FOUR THOUSAND THE STREET VALUE OF THOSE DRUGS ALONE OF THE OF THE ONES I JUST LISTED WAIT HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO YOU CAN SEE THAT YOU CAN MAKE QUITE A BIT OF MONEY IN A VERY NARROW TIMEFRAME. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE VERY. THERE IS ONE OTHER ARM START THERE IS ONE OTHER ONE LET ME SEE IF I CAN JUST REMEMBER THE NUMBERS OFF THE TOP MY HAD. THIS WAS ONE PATIENT THAT WENT TO ARM ONE POSITION BUT WHAT TO TWENTY EIGHT DIFFERENT PHARMACIES OVER A ONE YEAR PERIOD. DURING NOT TWENTY DURING THOSE VISITS THERE WERE THIRTY THOUSAND OXYCODONE DISPENSED TO THAT PATIENT. THOSE WERE NOT SELF USE THAT WAS STRUCK CELLS. SO CURIOUS IF PHARMACISTS WOULD GET IN THE HABIT OF LOOKING AT THEM. THEY CAN IDENTIFY WHAT'S GOING ON S. COULD THE PRESCRIBERS AT THE TIME THE PRESCRIBING WHICH IS PART OF WHAT THE ROLE THAT WERE ALL UP HERE. AND THIS. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE UNDERSTAND IT. THE BOARD IS SPENDING A LOT OF TIME DOING SOME PROACTIVE THINGS WITH THE PROFESSION. ON WE ARE THE ORIGIN OF SEVERAL MODIFICATIONS PROPOSED FOR CURES WHICH MINIATURE LOW IS THE AUTHOR OF THE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT. WE CONDUCT PERIODICALLY ABOUT EVERY TWO TO THREE MONTHS C. E. SEMINARS WHERE THE BOARD OF PHARMACY LITERALLY TALKS TO OUR. LICENSEES THEY GIVE SOME SIX HOURS OF SLEEP ANY PRETENDING SIX HOUR SESSIONS WHERE WE TALK ABOUT PRESCRIPTION DRUGS OF ABUSE BECAUSE SOMETIMES PHARMACISTS DON'T KNOW THAT THOSE DRUGS THAT ARE BACK ON THEIR SHELVES. HAVE SUCH HIGH STREET VALUE AND IN THAT ALL JUST GIVE THE OLD STORY ABOUT PROMETHAZINE WITH CODEINE. COST THE PHARMACY APPROXIMATELY TWELVE DOLLARS TO PURCHASE A PLATE OF IT. ON THE STREET THAT DRUG IS WORTH TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS THERE'S A HUGE SPREAD AND THAT THE ROBBERIES YOU'RE SEEN IN SACRAMENTO IF YOU'RE WATCHING TV. BUT THEY'RE JUMPING COUNTERS. PRINCIPAL TARGET OF THOSE JUMPING THE COUNTERS IS PRO MET WITH CODY WHICH IS CURRENTLY SCHEDULED PIPE DRUG. AND NOT REPORTED IN. INTEGERS. ON. WE ARE. ALSO. ARE TALKING ABOUT THE USE OF CURES AND WE PROMOTE IT. WE HAVE THE D. E. YEAR D. E. ACRE MEN AND THEY TALK ABOUT HOW TO SURVIVE THE D. E. A. INSPECTION BECAUSE THE D. E. A. DOES GO IN AND INSPECT AS DOES THE BOARD OF PHARMACY. WE HAVE OUR OWN BOTTOM PHARMACISTS THAT OUR INVESTIGATORS AND WE HAVE FIFTY OF THEM. SO WE ARE BUSY WITH THOSE FIFTY ONE THIRD OF THEM TARGET SPECIFICALLY PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE AND FRAUD. DRUG DIVERSION FROM PHARMACIES AND WHOLESALERS. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF. TALKING ABOUT CORRESPONDING RESPONSIBILITY AND IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I DON'T WANT TO GO ON ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IT'S A DIFFERENT SUBJECT TO A DEGREE. BUT BASICALLY CORRESPONDING RESPONSIBILITY IS A LOT BUT THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL WERE A PHARMACIST HAS THE OBLIGATION PROFESSIONAL ON RESPONSIBILITY. AND LEGAL REQUIREMENT TO ASSURE THAT WHEN HE OR SHE IS FILLING A PRESCRIPTION THAT THE PRESCRIPTION IS RIGHT FOR THAT PATIENT. AND EVEN IF THE PRESCRIBER IDENTIFIES THAT YES I WROTE THE PRESCRIPTION WE EXPECT THE PHARMACIST TO SAY NO IF IT'S IN HIS OR HER PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT THAT PATIENT SHOULDN'T HAVE. AND THERE'S A SERIES OF RED FLAGS THAT DID NOTE WHEN. PERHAPS YOU SHOULD NOT BE DISPENSED IN A DRUG TO APPEASE. WE ARE WORKING WITH PHARMACIES ON MEDICATION RECONCILIATION AND COUNTING THEIR SCHEDULE TWO DRUGS BECAUSE PHARMACIES ARE A MAJOR SOURCE OF LEACHING OUT INTO THE STREET. EMPLOYEES AND PHARMACIES ARE THOSE THAT HAVE ACCESS THE DRUGS ARE SO VALUABLE THEY CORRUPT AND THEY END UP COMING OUT OF THE PHARMACIES AND SO WE ARE NOW AT THE STAGE WHERE STARTING APRIL ONE. AND IT'S NOT A JOKE WE ARE REQUIRING PHARMACIES ACCOUNT SCHEDULE TWO DRUGS IN THEIR POSSESSION. EVERY NINETY DAYS AND THEY HAVE TO RECONCILE WHAT THEY PURCHASE WITH WHAT THEY DISPENSED TO FIND OUT IF THERE WERE LOSSES OR OVER JUST IN WHICH CASE THEY'RE REQUIRED TO EXPLAIN. SO. ON. THAT PRETTY MUCH CONCLUDES THE BULK OF WHAT I HAVE TO DO IT TODAY AND WHAT I'D LIKE TO SAY. ON WE ARE VERY INTERESTED IN WORKING WITH MEMBERS IN TRYING TO HELP PROVIDE A SAFER ENVIRONMENT FOR PATIENTS WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A MASS AND WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO GET OUT. THE. CHAIRMAN NO AND I MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY ANIMUS KIMBERLY KIRK MAYER AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA. THE MEDICAL BOARD HAS BEEN PART OF THE PROCESS TO IT ESTABLISH CARES TO POINT KNOW WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS IN THE BOARD OF PHARMACY. I ACTUALLY SAT ON THE CHANGE CONTROL BOARD ASKED US MISS HAROLD NEXT TO ME. AND BE ACTUALLY WE'VE BEEN VERY INVOLVED FROM THE BEGINNING IN ESTABLISHING THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SYSTEM AND THEN ALSO ATTENDING MEETINGS TO FIND OUT ABOUT IT STATUS. I'M CALM COMPLETION AND THEN ONGOING IMPROVEMENTS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT IN THE PROCESS OF THE SYSTEM. WITH THE DEPARTMENT THE BOARD OF PHARMACY WE ALSO ATTEND MONTHLY MEETINGS STATUS MEETINGS AND QUARTERLY CHANGE CONTROL BOARD MEETINGS. AS ISSUES ARISE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS BEEN A TENTATIVE TO OUR CONCERNS AND HAS MADE CHANGES BASED UPON BOARD STAFF'S REQUEST. IN ADDITION DOJ STAFF HAS PROVIDED TRAINING TO ASSIST WITH THE NEW SYSTEM. THE BOARD IS VERY PLEASED WITH THE NEW CARES TO POINT OUT SYSTEM AS NOT ONLY DOES IT PROVIDE MORE EFFICIENT AND TIMELY ACCESS BUT IT ALSO PROVIDES MORE INFORMATION TO THE BOARD. FOR EXAMPLE WERE GETTING PRESCRIPTION NUMBERS REFILLS IMPARTIAL REFILLS INFORMATION AND THE ADDRESS OF THE RECORD OF. DRESS OF RECORD OF THE PHARMACY AND THEN ALSO PAYMENT METHODS AND THE ABILITY NOW TO CUSTOMIZE REPORTS. THE MEDICAL BOARD CANNOT UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF CARE SYSTEM AND IT'S AN INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS AND ITS MISSION OF CONSUMER PROTECTION. SPECIFICALLY AS IT RELATES TO THE CURRENT OPIOID EPIDEMIC. HOWEVER BEFORE AGAIN TO BEGIN TALKING ABOUT HOW WE ACTUALLY USED THE CARE SYSTEM AND THE IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENTS FROM KIDS TO PLAY NOW. I WOULD LIKE TO BE CLEAR THAT THE CARES IS JUST A TOOL USE IN THE INVESTIGATION PROCESS. THE BOARD COULD NEVER TAKE ACTION AGAINST THE POSITION JUST BASED UPON THE CARES REPORT. MANY MORE PROCEDURES ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE COMPLETED SO THE BOARD MUST VALIDATE THE INFORMATION AND CARES AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WE MUST ATTAIN A PATIENT'S MEDICAL RECORDS. IN ADDITION IN THESE TYPES OF CASES THE BOARD MUST HAVE A MEDICAL EXPERTS SAY THAT THERE WAS A DEPARTURE FROM THE STANDARD OF CARE. IN THE TREATMENT PROVIDED TO THE PATIENT BY THE PHYSICIAN. BUT AGAIN THE USEFULNESS OF CURES IN THIS PROCESS AGAIN CANNOT BE UNDERSCORED. ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT OF THE INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE GOING ON AT THE HEALTH QUALITY INVESTIGATION UNIT ARE RELATED TO INAPPROPRIATE UNDER OVER PRESCRIBING OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES BY A PHYSICIAN. THE BOARD USES THE CARE SYSTEM IN ORDER TO MEET ITS MISSION OF CONSUMER PROTECTION AND TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST THE POSITIONS WHO ARE A DANGER TO THE PUBLIC. WITHOUT KID HERE'S THE BOARD WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO MEET THIS MISSION AND WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO STOP INAPPROPRIATE AND OVER PRESCRIBING INTO VERSION OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. THE BOARD USES CARES IN ITS ROLE. BASICALLY IN ITS ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM IF THE BOARD RECEIVES A COMPLAINT REGARDING ANY PRESCRIBING ISSUES RELATED TO CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES IT IS ABLE TO NOT ONLY OBTAIN FROM A CURES RECORD OF THE PRESCRIPTIONS FOR THE PATIENT INVOLVED IN THE COMPLAINT. BUT ALSO FOR THE PHYSICIAN LISTED AS THE PRESCRIBER. THIS IS USUALLY THE FIRST STEP IN THE INITIAL REVIEW OF THESE TYPES OF COMPLAINTS. THE BOARD WILL RUN A PATIENT PROFILE REPORT AND A PRESCRIBER HISTORY REPORT TO OBTAIN THE PRESCRIPTION INFORMATION. DEPENDING UPON THE COMPLAIN THE CURES REPORT MAY NEED TO BE EVALUATED BY A MEDICAL EXPERT. IN THE SAME SPECIALITY ASK THE POSITION TO IDENTIFY THE PATIENTS NEED TO BE REVIEWED TO DETERMINE IF THE PHYSICIAN IS INAPPROPRIATELY PRESCRIBING. IN ADDITION THAT EXPERT COME LOOK AT THE COMBINATION OF DRUGS USE AS WELL AS ANY OTHER RED FLAGS THAT SUGGEST THE POSITION MAY BE A DANGER TO THE PUBLIC. AND ITS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT A POINT OUT THAT WHEN WE GET TO THAT POINT WE ACTUALLY THERE'S ONLY THREE WAYS IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE CAN OBTAIN THOSE PATIENTS MEDICAL RECORDS. SO THE FIRST WAY IS THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO OBTAIN A SIGNED PATIENT AUTHORIZATION TO GET THOSE MEDICAL RECORDS OR IF THE PATIENT IS DECEASED WE HAVE TO ATTEMPT TO GET AUTHORIZATION FROM THE PATIENT'S BENEFICIARY OR PERSON. PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE. OBVIOUSLY AS YOU CAN IMAGINE A LOT OF THESE OVER PRESCRIBING CASES THE BOARD CANNOT GET THE AUTHORIZATION FROM THE PATIENT. SO THEREFORE THE BOARD MUST GO TO ITS SECOND OPTION AND MUST BE ABLE TO OBTAIN AT A SUBPOENA FOR THIS MATTER BUT WE DO HAVE TO HAVE A PATIENTS NAMES AND THE ONLY WAY WE CAN OBTAIN THAT IS THROUGH THE CARE SYSTEM. AND THEN IN ADDITION WE ALSO HAVE TO HAVE GOOD CAUSE TO SUBSTANTIATE THAT SUBPOENA. I'M IF THE MATTER WAS ACTUALLY A CRIMINAL MATTER THIS IS THE THIRD WAY WE WOULD ACTUALLY THEN BE ABLE TO OBTAIN A SEARCH WARRANT BUT AGAIN WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION TO SUPPORT THAT. TO GO TO THE COURTS SO AS YOU CAN SEE IN OUR PROCESS OF TAKING ACTION AGAINST A POSITION AT THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF CURES IS WHAT HELPS US TO DO OUR ROLE. IN MEETING THE MANDATE OF CONSUMER PROTECTION AND THEN ALSO BEING ABLE TO DISCIPLINE PHYSICIANS WHO ARE IN DANGER I'M FOR THE PUBLIC AND SO WITH THAT I'LL CLOSE AND. THAT ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE. CRITIC YOU VERY MUCH INDEED GOOD QUESTIONS ON DR GRANT. SO FIRST I JUST WANT TO AGAIN SAY THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE FROM ONE POINT OUT TO TO POINT OUT THE. TRANSITIONS THE AUTOMATED AUTHORITY THE COMPACTS ARE TRULY TRANSFORMATIVE TO THE PROGRAM AND REALLY HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS AND. WE NEED TO BE CELEBRATING WHEN YOU'VE BEEN RESPONSIVE AND REALLY LISTENING TO PROVIDERS WANTING TO HELP. SO I WANTED TO ACTUALLY TURN IF I COULD ASK THE PHARMACIST I KNOW THAT WE HAD. ATTEMPTED TO. ALLOW PHARMACISTS TO BE ABLE TO PRESCRIBE NOR CAN TO PATIENTS IN THOSE SITUATIONS THAT YOU WERE DESCRIBING EARLIER OF OF THE OUT LIARS. DO WE HAVE ANY DATA TO FOLLOW UP AND FIGURE OUT IF WE'VE BEEN PRESCRIBING NOR CAN. WHAT ARE THE RATES THAT PHARMACISTS ARE USING? TO HAVE THAT LIFESAVING MEDICATION OUT AND IS THERE OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THAT FOR. WELL. YES AND NO WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OUR C. E. SEMINARS IF THEY STAY AN EXTRA HOUR WE ARE EDUCATING PHARMACISTS THAT STAYED THE EXTRA HOUR TO EARN THAT OUR THAT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THAT UNDER THEIR OWN AUTHORITY. WHAT THIS IS IT'S A DRUG THAT BLOCKS OVERDOSE AND ALTHOUGH IT'S A PRESCRIPTION ITEM THAT ALLOWS A PHARMACIST TO PROVIDE HAND? SO AT THE TIME FOR EXAMPLE WE SEE A USE AT THE TIME YOU GET AND. OPIOID FROM THE PHARMACY THEY SHOULD BE ENCOURAGING THE CONSULTING SPECIFICALLY IN THE AREA. THERE IS A STRUGGLE AT IN THE EVENT YOU HAVE AN ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE THIS IS WHAT YOU TAKE WE'RE NOT THERE YET BOMB I THINK THAT THERE'S GOING BE BUILT MORE LESS TO THAT EFFECT INTRODUCED THIS YEAR. WE HAVE TRAINED OURSELVES ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED PHARMACISTS SPECIFICALLY TO PROVIDE NALOXONE BECAUSE WE STRONGLY BELIEVE IT'S AN IMPORTANT SAFEGUARD. WE ARE ABOUT TODAY WE HAVE A BOARD MEETING WHERE ONE OF THE OUTCOMES IS GOING TO BE PUT ON A WHEN OUR C. E. PROGRAM. ONLINE THAT THEY'LL BE ABLE TO TAKE GO ONLINE AND CERTIFY AND DO IT THAT WAY. BUT PART OF THE PROBLEM AS WITH ANY DRUG AND EVEN THE ABUSE ONCE BUT IT'S THE REIMBURSEMENT PEACE AND SO THE PHARMACY WOULD HAVE TO ASK THE PATIENT EITHER SOMETIMES INSURANCE WILL COVER IT. SOMETIMES IT WON'T. AND IF IT DOESN'T THEN THEY'LL HAVE TO CHARGE THE PATIENT FOR THE DRUG AND THAT BECOMES A DETERRENT AND UNFORTUNATELY LIKE MANY THINGS SOME OF THE DRUGS HAVE GOTTEN VERY EXPENSIVE. THE MOST WONDERFUL DEVICE OUT THERE IS THE FORTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR FOR TWO ADMINISTRATIONS. SELF ADMINISTRATOR EIGHT ADMINISTERING UNIT THAT WALKS YOU THROUGH STICKING YOURSELF WITH THE PRODUCTS THOUGH THAT IN. IF SOMEONE'S OVERDOSING AT LEAST PEOPLE LIKE ME ARE GOING TO BE VERY INTIMIDATED VERY FRIGHTENED THIS LITERALLY WALKS YOU THROUGH VERY CALMLY WE THREE COULD DO. BUT FORTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR TWO DOSES THAT IS ALL AROUND FOR MANY AND I BELIEVE THAT IS ACTUALLY THE WHOLESALE PRICE. SO TO ANSWER YOU WE'VE GOT A LONG WAY TO GO IN THIS BUT WE SEE REAL PROMISE SOME REAL POTENTIAL AND IT IS IN FACT A BOARD PRIORITY. TO REALLY HELP PHARMACIST BECOME FOR. THE POSITION AND TO PROVIDE NO WATSON BECAUSE THEY'RE IN THE RIGHT PLACE TO DO IT. I AM I WAS INTERESTED IN YOUR COMMENT THAT PHARMACIES ARE GOING TO BE TRACKING THE MEDICATIONS THAT YOU HAVE ON A NINETY DAY. CYCLE. PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE PASSED PARTIAL FILL PRESCRIPTIONS LAST YEAR AND WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE HAVING THE SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE THAT PHARMACIES ARE. TRACKING A FOLLOWING WHERE THOSE MEDICATIONS ARE SO I JUST WOULD LIKE TO REACH OUT TO YOU AND. YOUR TEAM TO MAKE SURE THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT LOSS DOWN. BEING PUT TO THE BEST USE. WE WILL IT WILL WORK WITH YOUR OFFICE IF YOU'D LIKE SIR IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO US THAT WE STOP THIS FLOW OUT OF PHARMACIES THEY HAVE TO REPORT TO S.. WITHIN EITHER FOURTEEN OR THIRTY DAYS WHEN THERE'S A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES DRUG LOST. SOMETIMES THEY DON'T DO IT SOMETIMES WHEN THEY DO IT'S ALARMING WHAT THEY REPORT. AND IT ISN'T TYPICALLY A THIRTY DAY LOS IT'S JUST THE NOTICE REQUIRES YOU COUNT WHAT'S IMPORTANT. SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HELPING THEM DO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AMASS A QUESTION FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WITH RESPECT TO THE. LEGISLATURE'S MANDATE OF FOR DOCTORS TO AND CHECK IN WITH TEARS UP AND IS THAT GOING TO BE A CERTIFIED IS THERE ANY. UPDATE WITH RESPECT AS. THAT ISSUE. AND YES THEM WE YOU KNOW WE JUST COMPLETED HIRING THE RESOURCES THAT WOULD BE DEDICATED TO THAT EFFORT AND WHERE YOU KNOW CURRENTLY CONDUCTING SYSTEM AND LOW TESTING. BUT SWEET WE DO PLAN TO NO LATER THAN JULY CERTIFIED. WONDERFUL. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM ANY OTHER MEMBERS. WONDERFUL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR. PARTICIPATION HERE TODAY. THEN FOR US AUTHOR PANEL OF. OF WE WILL. CONTINUOUS HAVE. SCRIPT MIRED THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR REMAINING FOR THE CALIFORNIA. WITH A MEDICAL BOARDS AND ALSO. STIR EDWARD KIM WHO RIPS AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE MISTER JOHN LEVEL REPRESENTS THE CALIFORNIA NARCOTICS OFFICERS. AND MISTER PETER YOU BRING WITH THE. DIRECTOR OF POLICE PRACTICES FOR THE ACLU MR CAN WOULD YOU CARE TO GET. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CARILLO AND DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS COMMITTEE. I AM DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL EDWARD CAM. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE APPRECIATES THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE RECENT DECISION BY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT. LUIS VERSUS SUPERIOR COURT. AS ONE OF TWELVE LEAD PROSECUTORS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S HEALTH QUALITY ENFORCEMENT SECTIONS JOINT DEPARTMENT. OF JUSTICE IS HELP QUALITY ENFORCEMENT SECTIONS JOINT BROOKLYN FOR SPENT MODEL WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA I'VE SEEN THE DANGERS PRESENTED BY NEGLIGENT AND INCOMPETENT PRESCRIBERS. AND THE THREAT OF OVER PRESCRIBING OPIOIDS TO PATIENTS. AS WELL AS THE CONSEQUENCES OF ABUSE AND DIVERSION OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. OUR OFFICE WORKS REGULARLY WITH SEVERAL HEALTH CARE OVERSIGHT AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. TO INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE UNLAWFUL PRESCRIBING PRACTICES BY LICENSEES. THE RISING DEATH RATE FROM PRESCRIPTION DRUG OVERDOSE IS A NATIONAL PROBLEM. THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION RECENTLY REPORTED THAT AND TWENTY SIXTEEN. THERE WERE SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND DRUG OVERDOSE DEATHS IN THE UNITED STATES AN ALARMING TWENTY ONE PERCENT INCREASE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. TO PUT THIS NUMBER INTO PERSPECTIVE THAT EXCEEDS THE NUMBER OF FATALITIES FROM MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENTS IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. AND P. COMMERCE SITES IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE. THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. YOU BILL UTILIZATION REVIEW AND EVALUATION SYSTEM BETTER KNOWN AS CHEERS IS CALIFORNIA'S PRESCRIPTION DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM. CURIOUS IS A CRITICAL TOOL HEAVILY RELIED ON BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND OTHER STATE AGENCIES. FOR EXAMPLE THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA UTILIZES CURES TO MONITOR INVESTIGATE AND OVERSEE TO PRESCRIBING PRACTICES BY ITS LICENSEES. EFFECTIVE USE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM SUCH AS CURES CAN REVEAL WHEN PATIENTS AMONG OTHER THINGS ARE DOCTOR SHOPPING. INFORMATION THAT DOCTORS NEED TO DETECT AND PREVENT ABUSE AND DIVERSION. CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF ADDRESSING THE EFFECTS OF NEGLIGENT OR INCOMPETENT PRESCRIBING AND DISPENSING. WE UNDERSTAND ALL TOO WELL THAT TIME LOST IN AN INVESTIGATION CAN MEAN LIVES LOST. AND DEVASTATED FAMILIES. THE LUIS DECISION IS CRITICAL FOR PUBLIC SAFETY BECAUSE IT AFFIRMS THE ABILITY OF CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE REGULATORY AGENCIES. TO REVIEW INFORMATION FROM THE CURIOUS DATABASE WITHOUT A WARRANT OR SUBPOENA. ANY DELAY IN ACCESS TO CURES CRITICALLY AFFECTS PINE LINES IN INVESTIGATIONS. REGULATORS USE CURES TO WAY PHYSICIANS USE YOUR STETHOSCOPES TO EVALUATE THEIR PATIENTS. JURORS ALLOWS FOCUSED INCREASE INTO THE STANDARD OF CARE APPLICABLES TO PROVIDERS IS PRESCRIBING AND THE CORRESPONDING RESPONSIBILITY A PHARMACIST. TEARS ALLOWS REGULATORS TO SPOT CHECK ESCRIBIR FOR COMPLIANCE IN ORDER TO DETECT AND ADDRESS PROBLEMS BEFORE PATIENTS ARE THREATENED. THIS CRITICAL TOOL WAS RECOGNIZING LUIS CASE. AND LUIS THE CENTRAL LEGAL QUESTION WAS DID THE MEDICAL BOARD VIOLATE PATIENTS' RIGHT TO PRIVACY UNDER THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION WHEN IT OBTAINED CURES DATA WITHOUT A WARRANT WERE SUBPOENA. DURING THE COURSE OF INVESTIGATION OF THE PATIENT'S PHYSICIAN DR LUIS. THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HELD THAT IT DID NOT. DO LUIS CASE BEGAN IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. WITH A PATIENT COMPLAINT TO THE MEDICAL BOARD THAT DID NOT INVOLVE DOCTOR LEWIS IS PRESCRIBING OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. ACCESS TO CURIOUS DID NOT REQUIRE A PATIENT RELEASE OR SUBPOENA. EARLY IN THE INVESTIGATION A SWORN BORN AND EXPLORING BOARD INVESTIGATOR OBTAINED IT CURES PRESCRIBER ACTIVITY REPORT ON DR LUIS. AFTER REVIEW BY MEDICAL CONSULTANT THE INVESTIGATOR SOUGHT AND OBTAINED RELEVANT MEDICAL RECORDS. ULTIMATELY THE BOARD FILE CHILD CHARGES BASED UPON THE ORIGINAL COMPLAINT AND FIVE ADDITIONAL PATIENTS AFTER REVIEW OF THE CURE'S DATA. A HEARING WAS HELD. BEFORE ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE AND THE BOARD ISSUED ITS DECISION PLACING DOCTOR LOUIS ON THREE YEARS PROBATION. LUIS APPEALED INDICATES ULTIMATELY MADE ITS WAY TO THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT WHICH GRANTED REVIEW. THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HELD THAT ANY INTRUSION INTO LEGALLY PROTECTED. PRIVACY INTERESTS HERE WAS JUSTIFIED BY THE STATE'S DUAL INTEREST IN NUMBER ONE. PROTECTING THE PUBLIC FROM THE UNLAWFUL USE AND DIVERSION OF PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS DRUGS NAMELY CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. AND NUMBER TWO PROTECTING PATIENTS. FROM NEGLIGENT AND INCOMPETENT DOCTORS. THREE SALIENT FILINGS ONSITE THREE SALIENT FINDINGS MADE BY THE SUPREME COURT AND LUIS ARE FIRST. PATIENTS KNOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT MONITORS CONTROLLED DRUGS. SECOND DELAYS PLACE THE PUBLIC AT RISK. AND THIRD PRIVACY PROTECTIONS EXIST FOR THE INFORMATION AND CURES. REGARDING THE STATE'S MONITORING OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE PRESCRIBING. SUPREME COURT FOUND THAT ALTHOUGH PATIENTS HAVE SOME REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY IN THEIR PRESCRIPTION RECORDS. THAT PRIVACY INTERESTS WAS LESS ROBUST THAN THE PRIVACY INTERESTS ASSOCIATED WITH FULL MEDICAL RECORDS. UNLIKE A PATIENTS COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL RECORD MAINTAINING A DOCTOR'S OFFICE. IT RESEMBLED AND PATIENT WOULD KNOW OR SHOULD KNOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT MONITORS TO SAILING DISTRIBUTION OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. AND THAT PRESCRIPTION RECORDS ARE ROUTINELY REVIEWED BY PHARMACISTS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES. AS TO THE NEED FOR AN EXPEDITION EXPEDITIOUS ACCESS TO CURES. THE SUPREME COURT FOUND THAT REQUIRED THE BOARD FIRST OBTAINED COURT PERMISSION TO ACCESS CURES DATA WOULD ENTAIL. PRESENTING EVIDENCE JUDICIAL OFFICER ESTABLISHING GOOD BECAUSE AS PART OF ITS PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION. IT COULD RESULT IN PROTRACTED LEGAL BATTLES THAT EFFECTIVELY DERAIL THOSE INVESTIGATIONS. SUCH A DELAY WHICH IN RECENT APPELLATE LITIGATION BY OUR OFFICE HAS TAKEN YEARS. IS TOLERATED IN CONNECTION WITH FULL MEDICAL RECORDS BECAUSE OF THE HEIGHTENED PRIVACY INTERESTS IMPLICATED. BY GOVERNMENT SEARCHES OF MEDICAL RECORDS. FOR PRESCRIPTION RECORDS HOWEVER DELAYS OF THAT MAGNITUDE WOULD IMPEDE THE BOARD'S ABILITY TO SWIFTLY IDENTIFY. AND STOP DANGEROUS PRESCRIBING PRACTICES. THE US TIMELY ACCESS TO PRESCRIPTION DISPENSING DATA IS CRITICAL TO ENSURING THE QUALITY OF MEDICAL CARE IN CALIFORNIA. TO SAVING LIVES. FINALLY REGARDING PROTECTIONS THE SUPREME COURT RECOGNIZED AT THE LAW CONTAINS A NUMBER OF PROVISIONS DESIGNED TO SAFEGUARD PATIENT PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY. WHICH LIMIT THE DEGREE TO WHICH PATIENT PRIVACY IS INVADED WHEN THE BOARD EXAMINES PRESCRIPTION RECORDS. FAILURE TO ABIDE BY THOSE LIMITATIONS CAN RESULT IN SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES. IN CONCLUSION HERE SOME TAKEAWAYS FROM THE LUIS DECISION. FIRST THE IMPACT OF THE LEWIS DECISION ON FUTURE ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES IS PROFOUND. A DIFFERENT RESULT COULD HAVE STYMIED THE PURPOSE OF CURES AND POTENTIALLY PLACED AT RISK THE EFFICACY AND VIABILITY OF PRESCRIPTION DRUG MONITORING PROGRAMS PROTECTING PATIENTS AND OTHERS THROUGHOUT THE NATION. SECOND. THE SUPREME COURT ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE BOARD CAN INVESTIGATE DOCTORS BASED ON ITS OWN INITIATIVE. THIS ACKNOWLEDGEMENT IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ANALYTICAL FEATURES OF CURES CAN LEAD TO DIRECTED PROACTIVE INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS TO AVOID PUBLIC HARM. THE US SUPREME COURT FOUND THAT. THE BOARD'S COUNTERVAILING INTEREST IN PROTECTING THE PUBLIC FROM NEGLIGENT AND INCOMPETENT DOCTORS. AND. TO PREVENT AGAINST ABUSE AND DIVERSION OF SCHEDULE TWO TOOK SCHEDULE FOUR CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES OUT WEIGH ANY POTENTIAL INVASION OF PRIVACY. CAUSED BY THE BOARD'S ACTIONS. AND IT REJECTED AN INDIVIDUALIZED COULD CAUSE REQUIREMENT HERE SINCE TO BOARD TO USE AIDED ITS EFFORTS TO CONTROL THE DIVERSION AND RESULT IN ABUSE OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL RECOGNIZES THE HARD WORK OF ALL THOSE AT THE DEPARTMENT CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND DEPARTMENT JUSTICE IN THIS CASE. IT WAS TRULY A TEAM EFFORT. THROUGH THESE EFFORTS TO SUPREME COURT DECISION IN LUIS AFFIRMS CRUISES CRITICAL FUNCTION AS A TOOL IN ADMINISTRATIVE INVESTIGATIONS TO ANALYZE PRESCRIBING PRACTICES. AND DISPENSING HISTORY THAT CAN LEAD TOWARDS BETTER PUBLIC PROTECTION. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT. BIGGEST CAN. AS STATED BY MR CAM OF THE LUIS DECISION DOES NOT CHANGE THE WAY THE BOARD USES CARES. THE BOARDS USE OF CARES PROVIDES PRESCRIPTION DATA TO THE BOARD AND PROVIDES INVESTIGATOR A ROADMAP IN DETERMINING IF A POSITION AS A DANGER TO THE PUBLIC. AS PREVIOUSLY STATED THE PORT COULD NOT OBTAIN A PATIENT'S MEDICAL RECORDS WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION OR GOOD CAUSE FOR A SUBPOENA OR A SEARCH WARRANT. IN ADDITION ONCE A PATIENT'S MEDICAL RECORDS ARE OBTAINED THE MEDICAL BOARD DOES NOT RELEASE THOSE RECORDS EXCEPT UNDER DISCOVERY OR DURING AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING BEFORE AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE. OR BEFORE A JUDGE IN A CRIMINAL COURT OR NGUYEN REQUIRED BY LAW SUCH AS WHEN REQUIRED BY A COURT ORDER. IN ADMINISTRATIVE CASES THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL HANDLING THE CASE WILL REQUEST THE RECORDS TO BE SEALED UNDER THE EXHIBITS. THE BOARD TAKES PRIVACY SERIOUSLY AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO WHILE MEETING ITS MISSION OF CONSUMER PROTECT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN LOW AND. HONORABLE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS PETER BE BRING I AM DIRECTOR OF POLICE PRACTICES FORTY. ACLU OF CALIFORNIA. WE FILED AN AMICUS BRIEF AND. THE LUIS CASE. OUTLINING PRIVACY CONCERNS IT'S I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS A LITTLE BIT HERE. OF COURSE THIS COMMITTEE HAS HEARD HEALTH AND. OPIOID EPIDEMIC. AND. I WOULD LIKE TO TODAY JUST SKETCHES. THE THE PRIVACY INTERESTS AT STAKE WITH. CURES AND IN DOING THAT I I WANT TO. DRAW A COUPLE OF DISTINCTIONS THAT ARE GONNA RUN THROUGHOUT. MY TESTIMONY HERE FIRST. I'M TALKING HERE ABOUT IDENTIFYING PATIENT INFORMATION SO. Q. IS COULD OPERATE. UNDER REGIME WHERE INFORMATION ABOUT PRESCRIPTIONS THAT DOCTORS. THE PHARMACIES ALL ACCESSIBLE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. WHILE. INFORMATION ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS IDENTIFYING INFORMATION AND THEIR MEDICAL INFORMATION IS PRIVATE. SO I WANT. BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT. BALANCING THE PUBLIC HEALTH INTERESTS IN A DEBT IN ADDRESSING YOUR GOOD CRISIS WITH STRONG PRIVACY INTERESTS AND PRESCRIPTION. INFORMATION. IS POSSIBLE IT CAN BE DONE OTHER STATES DO IT. BUT CALIFORNIA. I WOULD RESPECTFULLY SUBMIT IS NOT SETTING THAT BALANCE. CORRECTLY THIS TIME ADEQUATELY PROTECTING PRIVACY. SO IS THIS COMMITTEE HAS ALREADY HEARD THIS MORNING. THE BASIC DATABASE CONTENT FOR. CURES INCLUDES. THE FULL NAME ADDRESS AND TELEPHONE NUMBER OF THE PATIENT THEIR GENDER. AND DATE OF BIRTH THAT IS WHAT I WOULD. CLASSIFY AS THE PATIENT IDENTIFYING INFORMATION IT ALSO OF COURSE CONTAINS INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRESCRIPTION. THE. NATIONAL DRUG CODE NUMBER OF THE MEDICATION DISPENSED DRUG QUANTITY ARMS NUMBER OF REFILLS ORDERED WHETHER IT IS THE FIRST TIME REQUEST. OR REFILL. THE ORIGIN OF THE PRESCRIPTION AND THE DATE OF THIS I THINK. AND. THE KEY THE KEY TO THE PRIVACY CONCERN HERE. IS THAT ALTHOUGH. SOME OF THE TESTIMONY HERE TODAY AND THE STATE IN THE LUIS CASE DRAWS A. TRY TO DRAW A STRONG DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE PRIVACY INTERESTS AND FULL MEDICAL RECORDS WHICH. EXHIBITS CHRYSLER HAS INDICATED THEY REQUIRE A CITY. HE'S A SUBPOENA FOR AND PRESCRIPTION INFORMATION THE FACT IS THAT PRESCRIPTION INFORMATION SENSITIVE MEDICAL INFORMATION. THAT IN MANY CASES. BECAUSE DRUGS ARE APPROVED ONLY TO TREAT A NARROW RANGE OF. SPECIFIC MEDICAL CONDITIONS DESCRIPTION INFORMATION CAN REVEAL HIGHLY SENSITIVE UNDERLYING HEALTH INFORMATION FOR EXAMPLE. HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY FOR TREATMENT OF GENDER IDENTITY DISORDER OR SEXUAL DYSPHORIA. HE'S LIKELY TO BE REVEALED SIMPLY BY THE PRESCRIPTION. SIMILARLY. CONDITIONS INCLUDING WEIGHT LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH. AIDS. MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS INCLUDING TRAUMA AND STRESS RELATED DISORDERS OR ANXIETY DISORDERS ALCOHOL ADDICTION OPIOID ADDICTION. EIGHTY HD EPILEPSY A VARIETY OF HEALTH CONDITIONS ARE LIKELY TO BE REVEALED OR AT LEAST WRONGLY INDICATED. SIMPLY BY THE. NATURE OF THE PRESCRIPTION. A SECOND POINT UNDER THE CURIOUS SYSTEM. LAW ENFORCEMENT CURRENTLY HAS ESSENTIALLY OPEN ACCESS. HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE. ONE ONE ONE SIX FIVE C. TO CONTEMPLATE GIVING CURIOUS DATA BROADLY TO APPROPRIATE STATE LOCAL AND FEDERAL PUBLIC AGENCIES FOR DISPLAYING CIVIL OR CRIMINAL PURPOSES AND OTHER AGENCIES AND ENTITIES IS TO. DETERMINED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FOR THE PURPOSE OF EDUCATING PRACTITIONERS AND OTHERS. IN LIEU OF DISCIPLINARY CIVIL OR CRIMINAL ACTIONS IS AN INCREDIBLY BROAD MANDATE FOR ACCESS. AND ALTHOUGH THERE ARE. PROVISIONS IN THE LAW THAT THAT. CALL FOR COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE FEDERAL AND STATE PRIVACY LAWS AND REGULATION IS NO ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM. AND NO PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION OF A. PATIENT PRIVACY IN FACT IN IN THE LUIS CASE THE TESTIMONY. OF ONE OF THE MEDICAL BOARD EXAMINERS. WAS THAT. THE BOARD ROUTINELY RUN SECURE SUPPORT ON PHYSICIANS UNDER INVESTIGATION IN FACT THE FACTS OF LUIS SHOW THAT. THAT WAS A CASE WHERE DOCTOR LEWIS WAS UNDER INVESTIGATION BECAUSE HE RECOMMENDED. WHAT A PATIENT BELIEVE WAS AN UNHEALTHY DIET HE SUGGESTED THAT THAT? SHE SHOULD TRY LOSING WEIGHT BY EATING. BY A FIVE BY DIET FIVE BITES OF FOOD AT LUNCH AND FIVE BITES OF FOOD AT DINNER. IN THE COURSE OF INVESTIGATING. THAT COMPLAINT. THE MEDICAL BOARD PULL THREE YEARS OF PRESCRIPTION DATA. CLEARLY UNRELATED TO THE NATURE OF THE COMPLAINT. AND WE SEEN THAT IN IN OTHER CASES ACTUALLY OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA ONE OF THE OTHER. MAJOR PIECES OF LITIGATION INVOLVES A. PATIENT. A PARAMEDIC. RYAN PILE IN UTAH. WHO? WHOSE FIRE STATIONS WERE. BEING INVESTIGATED FOR. MORPHINE THEFT WAS MORPHINE AT THE FIRE STATION THAT WAS BEING. TAMPERED WITH AND POTENTIALLY STOLEN. IN THE COURSE OF THAT INVESTIGATION YOU TO AUTHORITIES PULLED THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG. RECORDS OF EVERY ALL OF THE FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY EMPLOYEES OF THE FIRE STATIONS AND JUST LOOK AT THEM. MISTER PYLE WAS NOT CHARGED OR INVESTIGATED IN CONNECTION WITH THE THEFT OF THE MORPHINE. BUT THEY THE AUTHORITIES FOUND WHAT THEY BELIEVED WAS. EVIDENCE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUG FRAUD TRYING TO ON GET PRESCRIPTIONS FROM MULTIPLE DOCTORS. AND AFTER US THIS WAS UNCOVERED IN THE COURSE OF A UNRELATED INVESTIGATION BECAUSE OF FREE ACCESS. OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL YEARS. AND INVESTIGATION THAT CAUSED. MISTER PYLE DEPRESSION NEARLY COST HIM THE ADOPTION OF HIS TWO SONS. CHARGES WERE ULTIMATELY DISMISSED AS WITHOUT EVIDENCE AND THAT IS THE POTENTIAL COST TO PRIVACY FROM ALLOWING FREE AND UNFETTERED ACCESS TO TO SENSITIVE. MEDICAL. INFORMATION. THIS KIND OF OPEN ACCESS IS NOT. REQUIRED FOR JURIST OPERATE AND THEIR. CIVIL THINGS CAN BE DONE IN FIRST OF ALL. PHYSICIAN AND PHARMACY INFORMATION CAN BE MADE VISIBLE WHILE PATIENT INFORMATION IS ANONYMIZED PATIENTS PROVIDED. UNIQUE IDENTIFYING INFORMATION WE HEARD EARLIER. ABOUT THE PROCESS OF DE DUPLICATION ON USING. AN ANALYTICS ENGINE TO STUDIES. VARIATIONS IN SPELLINGS OF NAMES ARE ST DRESSES. THAT CAN BE DONE INDEPENDENTLY OF THE PRESCRIPTION INFORMATION. BEFORE ANONYMOUS ASIAN OCCURS. SECOND THE BOARD CAN STILL USE INFORMATION ABOUT PATIENT ACTIVITY TO GET ON A WARRANT OR SOME OR SUBPOENA. FOR THE PATIENTS IDENTIFYING INFORMATION% IF AN ANALYSIS IF THE BOARD'S ANALYSIS. OF A PARTICULAR PATIENT SHOWS A PATTERN BY. THEIR. UNIQUE PATIENT. IDENTIFIER THAT SUGGESTS. PATTERN OF PRESCRIPTION FRAUD. THEY CAN EASILY PRIVATE. OBTAIN A SIX A SUBPOENA OR WARRANT FOR. THAT PATIENT. AND CERTAINLY IF IF PATIENT ASSISTANCE IS NEEDED IN THE INVESTIGATION OF A DOCTOR. THAT THE BOARD CAN PROCEED EITHER WITH ITS APPEAL WITH THE REQUEST FOR CONSENT. AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT. OPEN ACCESS TO THIS. INFORMATION IS NOT A UNIVERSAL RULE ALTHOUGH A FORTY NINE JURISDICTIONS IN THIS COUNTRY OPERATE SOME KIND OF. PRESCRIPTION DRUG DATABASE. TEN STATES REQUIRE A WARRANT OR DEMONSTRATION OF PROBABLE CAUSE. BY STATUTE ANOTHER REQUIRES ONE BY A JUDICIAL OPINION. STE NINE OTHERS REQUIRE REASONABLE SUSPICION. OR A SUBPOENA COURT ORDER OTHER THAN A WARRANT OR MAKE NO. EXPLICIT PROVISION FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCESS AND ONE STATE OF VERMONT ACTUALLY PROHIBITS LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCESS. AND THESE WARRANT REQUIREMENTS THESE. THAT OR SUBPOENA REQUIREMENTS. THERE IN PLACE IN OTHER STATES SHOW THAT THE. THE CONCERN THAT DOING SO IN CALIFORNIA WOULD COMPLETELY UNDERMINE THE SYSTEM ARE. OVERBLOWN AND AND I THINK IT'S WORTH IT A GUT CHECK WARRANTS DON'T TAKE YEARS WANTS TAKE. A DAY SOMETIMES HOURS SOMETIMES EVEN EVEN LESS TIME. LAW ENFORCEMENT OBTAINS ONCE A TEAM ONLY USES SUBPOENAS ROUTINELY. THAT LEVEL OF. OF INDIVIDUALIZED SUSPICION ON A PROCEDURAL PROTECTION. ON CAN PROVIDE A GREAT DEAL OF. PROTECTION FOR FOR PRIVATE MEDICAL RECORDS. AND IN FACT. CONCERNS ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCESS IN UTAH WHICH. THE STATE WHERE THE. THE PARAMEDIC I DISCUSSED EARLIER. HAD. HIS ORDEAL. LED THE UTAH LEGISLATURE TO IN FACT INSTALL A STATUTORY WARRANT REQUIREMENT. EFFECTIVE IN MAY TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN FOR THE ACCESS TO THEIR PRESCRIPTION DRUG DATABASE. AN AUDIT OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCESS SHOW THAT PRIOR TO THE. ESTABLISHMENT OF THAT REQUIREMENT MORE THAN SIXTY PERCENT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT CASES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. INCREASES THE DATABASE WERE QUESTIONABLE. WHEN THE WILL WARRANT REQUIREMENT WAS PUT IN PLACE. LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCESS DROPPED BY NINETY FIVE PERCENT STRONGLY SUGGESTING. THAT LAUNCH WAS WAS JUST TROLLING THE DATABASE. AND FINALLY I'D I WANT TO ADDRESS. THAT LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR THIS I IT IS CERTAINLY THE CASE THAT THE SO CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT IN LUIS HAS HELD. DEFINITIVELY THAT. THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT OF PRIVACY DOES NOT REQUIRE A WARRANT OR INDIVIDUAL A SUSPICION FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO ACCESS THE CURE'S DATABASE BUT THAT IS NOT THE END OF THE LEGAL QUESTIONS. SURROUNDING A LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCESS FIRST ALL THE COURT EXPLICITLY RESERVE THE QUESTION OF ANONYMOUS ASIAN AND DID NOT ADDRESS IT IN THAT CASE BECAUSE IT HAD NOT BEEN BRIEFED AND ALSO. EXPLICITLY RESERVED. ANY OPINION ON WHETHER ACT LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCESS. WARRANTLESS SUSPICION WAS ACCESS WAS ALLOWED UNDER THE FOR FOURTH AMENDMENT TO THE U. S. CONSTITUTION. THERE IS STRONG REASON TO THINK THAT. LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCESS. WITHOUT SUSPICION WITHOUT A WARRANT VIOLATES THE FOURTH AMENDMENT. THAT HAS BEEN LITIGATED IN A NUMBER OF OTHER CASES THROUGHOUT THE. COUNTRY WITH DIFFERING RESULTS TO DISTRICT COURTS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S PERCOLATING UP THROUGH THE COURTS. AND AND THAT IS. A SIMPLE MATTER OF. THE FACT THAT PATIENTS DO REASONABLY EXPECT THAT THE RECORDS OF THEIR PRESCRIPTION DRUG INFORMATION WILL REMAIN PRIVATE BETWEEN THEM. AND THEIR DOCTOR THEY EXPECTED NOT TO BESHARED WITH NON MEDICAL PERSONNEL WITHOUT CONSENT COURTS HAVE REPEATEDLY FOUND NOT JUST FULL MEDICAL RECORDS. TO BE PROTECTED BY A REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY BUT. BUT. PIECES OF MEDICAL RECORDS INCLUDING PRESCRIPTION. DRUG INFORMATION CERTAINLY A MAJORITY OF FEDERAL APPELLATE COURTS HAVE RECOGNIZED THAT. ON. IN STUDIES A PATIENT OPINION. NINETY THREE ZOGBY POLLS HAVE SHOWN THAT NINETY THREE PERCENT OF PATIENTS WANT. TO DECIDE WHICH GOVERNMENT ENTITIES CAN ACCESS THEIR RECORDS AND EIGHTY EIGHT PERCENT OPPOSE LEADING POLICE ACCESS WITHOUT PERMISSION. AND. ALTHOUGH THERE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ARGUMENTS THAT ARE PERCOLATING THROUGH THE COURTS I THINK THIS THIS QUESTION IS UNRESOLVED. ON AND THERE IS A STRONG ARGUMENT THAT. THE FOURTH AMENDMENT BARS THE KIND OF ACCESS THAT. CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY ALLOWS. PREFIGURING MUCH MISTER LITTLE. THANK YOU OF MY NAME IS JOHN LEVEL AND I REPRESENT THE THE CALIFORNIA NARCOTICS OFFICERS ASSOCIATION. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT SEE IN A WAY WE HAVE ABOUT. EIGHT THOUSAND MEMBERS. OUR MEMBERS ARE CHARGED WITH THE ENFORCEMENT OF STATE AND FEDERAL CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE LAWS. PARENTHETICALLY I'D NOTE THAT IT'S VERY DANGEROUS WORK EIGHTY OF OUR MEMBERS NAMES ARE ON THE PEACE OFFICER MEMORIAL WALL. AND AND HERE'S WHAT'S REALLY UNUSUAL BECAUSE YOU'VE DEALT WITH A NUMBER OF LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUPS THAT COME HERE AND TESTIFY. THREE OF OUR FORMER PRESIDENTS WERE KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY THEIR WORKS IT'S HIGHLY DANGEROUS. FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO COMMAND THE CHAIR FOR CALLING THIS HEARING IT'S TERRIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUE. WE HAVE. YESTERDAY OUR LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE MET. AND WE'VE EXAMINED YOUR THREE BILLS WHICH WE WILL STRONGLY SUPPORT WE BELIEVE THEY ARE AN IMPORTANT. STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THE INTERSTATE STRATEGY IS AN EXCELLENT ONE. INCLUDING SCHEDULE FIVE IS IMPORTANT. NOT JUST FOR THE STAND THE LINE STANDALONE LOOK AT SCHEDULE FIVE BUT. PART OF THIS TRAGEDY. WITH OUR MANY OVERDOSES IS THERE TRULY ACCIDENTAL. PATIENTS AND PHYSICIANS IF THEY DON'T LOOK. DON'T REALIZE THAT THE INTERACTION. BETWEEN SOME OF THOSE DRUGS AND. SOME OF THE OPIOIDS CAN BE FATAL. OF SO THAT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ADDITION AND. TIGHTENING UP THE SECURE PRINTING SYSTEM FOR ALL SCHEDULED DRUGS IS ALSO VALUABLE SO SEE AN AWAY WILL BE. WILL BE SUPPORTING THEM. WE WERE PLEASED TO CO SPONSOR SENATE BILL FOUR EIGHTY TWO. ALONG WITH THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS AND A NUMBER OF. PATIENT ADVOCATE DUB PATIENT SAFETY ADVOCATE GROUPS. WHAT? THAT BILL. REQUIRES THAT PRACTITIONERS EXAMINED EITHER THEMSELVES OR THROUGH SOME ON THE DELEGATE. EXAMINED THE CURIOUS DATABASE CRIER TO. WRITING A PRESCRIPTION FOR A PARTICULAR PATIENT. NOW WHAT WHAT IS OF CONCERN TO US. IS THAT. THAT LAW WAS SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY SIXTEEN. WE ARE NOW AND FEBRUARY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS NOT YET CERTIFIED. CURES TWO POINT ZERO. TO US. AND WE'RE NOT PROFESSIONALS IN THAT ORGANIZATION BUT FOR US THAT. GIVEN THE CRISIS THAT WE'RE FACING. THAT DELAYS IN EXPLICITLY INEXPLICABLE AND. WE WOULD HOPE AND HEARING TODAY THAT MAYBE WE WOULD GET SOME CERTIFICATION IN JULY. AGAIN WE WOULD HOPE THAT THAT PROCESS WOULD BE ACCELERATED. SO THAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT FOR EIGHTY TWO TO ITS FULLEST. IN A MORE TIMELY FASHION THEM WE'VE EXPERIENCED. SO FAR. I'M NOT GOING TO RELITIGATE THE LUIS CASE WE THINK IT'S GOOD LAW WE THINK THAT THE BALANCE STRUCK IAN. LOUIS. REALLY REFLECTS. THE STATE OF AFFAIRS THAT WE'RE WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE THE LEWIS CASE DID TALK ABOUT. THEORETICAL PRIVACY RIGHTS THAT THAT MIGHT BE. INTRUDED UPON. BUT IT MADE KNOWN THE IT MADE SPECIFIC NOTE OF THE STATE'S DUAL INTEREST. IN PROTECTING THE PUBLIC FROM THE UNLAWFUL USE AND DIVERSION. A PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS CLASS OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND PROTECTING PATIENTS FROM NEGLIGENT OR INCOMPETENT PHYSICIANS THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT BALANCING TEST. THE CITATION OF THE UTAH. SITUATION IS TOTALLY IRRELEVANT TO THIS DISCUSSION FIRST OF ALL CALIFORNIA CONTRARY TO WHAT YOU AGES TOLD. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE DOES NOT PERMIT UNFETTERED ACCESS A PATIENT RECORDS IN FACT. ATTORNEY GENERAL HARRIS. AS PART OF THE GUIDELINES THAT SHE PROMULGATED. A LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN ONLY GET ACCESS TO PATIENT RECORDS IN A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. OF THE PATIENT WHERE THEY HAVE A WARRANT. SO. AYE AYE I WOULD CAUTION YOU AGAINST. LOOKING AT IRRELEVANT EXAMPLES FROM OTHER STATES I MEAN THE PRIVACY ISSUE SERIOUS BUT IT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT SERIOUSLY AND SOBERLY. FINALLY JUST A COUPLE OF NOTES TO CALL TO YOUR ATTENTION. THERE BEEN SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN. WHICH AS YOU KNOW OF REDUCES THE PENALTY FOR CERTAIN RETAIL THEFT SO LONG AS YOU STEAL LESS THAN NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS MAKES IT A FELONY I MAKES A MISDEMEANOR. WHAT ONE OF THE SIDE EFFECTS OF THAT THAT HAS NOT BEEN DISCUSSED IS THERE'S A NICHE OF THAT CRIMINAL ACTIVITY? WHERE PERSONS ARE STEALING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS? THAT HAVE A RETAIL VALUE. CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES YOU HAVE A RETAIL VALUE UNDER NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS BUT IS ONE OF THE WITNESSES ON A PREVIOUS PANEL. INDICATED HAVE A STREET VALUE IN THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DEBATE ABOUT. THE PROP FORTY SEVEN RETAIL THEFT GAP THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. BUT MISSING FROM THAT DISCUSSION THUS FAR BY THIS LEGISLATURE. HAS BEEN FOCUSING ON THIS MORE NARROW NICHE WHERE PEOPLE CAN STEAL OPIOIDS. AS LONG AS THEY'RE UNDER NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY BUCKS HEY IT'S. IT'S A MISDEMEANOR. IN THEN THAT'S OUT IN THE STREETS SO I THINK THAT'S A PIECE THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT. DESPITE. ARE VERY HIGH RESPECT FOR DR EGGMAN. WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB ONE AB SIX FOR SEVERAL REASONS FIRST OF ALL AB ONE EIGHTY SIX HAS NO PATH TO TREATMENT. IT AND IT'S IMPORTANT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOR AND TREATMENT. DO YOU HAVE A PATH TO TREATMENT AND NOT TO ENABLE CONTINUED ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOR. SECONDLY AB ONE EIGHTY SIX HAS. NO REAL STRATEGIC USE OF METHADONE THERAPIES WHICH ARE IMPORTANT. SUBSTITUTE FOR OPIOIDS. THIRDLY. AND VERY DISTURBING IS THERE'S NO STRATEGY IN AB ONE AB SIX TO DEAL WITH IMPAIR DRIVING. NOT EVERYONE WHO GOES TO SAFE INJECTION SITE. IS WALKING. YOU KNOW IN FACT A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE OPIOID ADDICTED AB JOBS. IF CARS THERE'S NO. THERE'S NO STRATEGY FOR MAKING SURE WHAT'S THE PERSON IN JACK'S. THAT THERE. NOT SO IMPAIRED THAT THEY WOULD BE A DANGER TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS WHEN THEY DROVE AWAY IN THEIR VEHICLE. FINALLY THERE HAVE BEEN SERIOUS ISSUES RAISED. ABOUT. WHAT? PEOPLE SEE AS. WHERE THE CITING OF? OF THESE. SITES WILL BE IN FACT. I WAS IN A MEETING THE OTHER DAY OF THE CONGRESS OF RACIAL EQUALITY. AND THEY FOCUSED ON THAT THE CITING ISSUES OF THIS BILL AND. THE PRESIDENT REFERRED TO WHAT HE SAW US THE POTENTIAL OF THIS IS THE. THE SOFT BIGOTRY OF REMOTE INSTITUTIONS SO THERE ARE THOSE CONCERNS. FINALLY THERE'S ONE OTHER POINT I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH. IS LOOKING AT. THE ISSUE OF MANUFACTURE DISTRIBUTION. NOW I DON'T HAVE ANY EVIDENCE THAT THAT'S A PROBLEM HERE BUT I WILL TELL YOU WHEN I WAS A PROSECUTOR IN THE LA CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE YEARS AGO. ONE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY. SOLD. FORTY FIVE PERCENT OF THEIR WESTERN STATES INVENTORY OF APC CODY NUMBER FOUR WHICH HIGH GRADE PAIN KILLER. TO SEVEN STOREFRONT PHARMACIES IN SOUTH CENTRAL LOS ANGELES. AND IS A DIRECT RESULT OF THAT BEHAVIOR THOSE A STREET DRUGS. A. B. C. CODED NUMBER FOUR DOOR IT WAS CALLED DOORS AND FORCE INDUSTRY. WAS KILLING ABOUT FORTY PEOPLE A MONTH IN LA COUNTY. WE WENT AND PROSECUTED THE PHARMACY WE TURNED OVER THE NAMES OF THE DOCTORS TO. THE MEDICAL BOARD. BUT TO OUR HORROR. THE TIME THERE WAS NO LAW ADDRESSING. MANUFACTURE PER. PRACTICES LIKE THAT. THE FOLLOWING YEAR WHEN MY BOSS WAS ELECTED L. A. B. A I WAS HIS LOBBYIST UP HERE. WE SPONSORED LEGISLATION WHICH IS NOW LAW. THAT MAKES IT A CRIME FOR A MANUFACTURER TO WITH KNOWLEDGE OR CONSCIOUS DISREGARD. SELL THEIR PRODUCT. THAT IT. WHERE IT CAN BE DIVERTED INTO THE STREETS SO THAT'S ALREADY CURRENT LINE IF THAT IS A PROBLEM HERE AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT IT IS? NO THAT YOU HAVE A TOOL. THAT THAT CAN BE USED IN AGAIN I WANNA. THANK YOU FOR. THIS HEARING AND AND I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T SINGLE OUT YOUR STAFF FOR AN EXCELLENT. BACKGROUND DATA SHEET HOW THEY TOOK. THIS WHOLE WATERFRONT AND CONCISELY. PUT IT TOGETHER WAS IT. TRUE TRIBUTE TO FIND MORE. THANK YOU SO MUCH GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WITH THAT MR LEVEL THAT WILL CA CONCLUDE OUR OUR. OF THIS PANEL DISCUSSION SO THEY GIVE VERY MUCH FOR FOR THIS AND WE'LL HEAD INTO OUR FOURTH OF PANEL. AND AGAIN FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THERE IS OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AFTER CONCLUDING OUR FOURTH AND FINAL PANEL. IN THIS FOURTH AND FINAL PANEL WILL DISCUSS A RANGE FROM LICENSE HEALTH PROFESSIONALS CAN SPEAK ON HOW TO ENGAGE WITH THE OPIOID CRISIS IN THEIR DAILY PRACTICE. WE HAVE MISS VERONICA BANDY WHO IS A LICENSED PHARMACIST AND PROFESSOR VECTOR LEASE KNOW BECAUSE A PHYSICIAN WHO SPECIALIZES IN. PAIN MEDICINE. DOCTOR DAVE READ MINUTE TOM INTERESTS BASED IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. DR BILL UPDIKE WHO IS A LICENSED CHIROPRACTOR IN ANY OF THE TECHIE. BOTH OF POSITION AND OF LICENSES ACUPUNCTURIST SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US HERE AND I KNOW THAT I'VE SEEN MANY OF YOU. WHO WERE ALSO IN THE AUDIENCE AND ALSO OBSERVE THE ROBUST CONVERSATION SO IF YOU ALSO WISH TO ADDRESS ANY THESE OTHER ISSUES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED THOSE PLEASE FEEL FREE TO DO SO? SOFA SORT OFF OF WITH MISPRINT MISS BETTY SKEWED. MANY. AND DOCTOR BROADBAND THE PRESIDENT ELECT OF THE CALIFORNIA PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION AND THE PHARMACIST. ON BEHALF OF CPJ LIKE TO THANK. THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. PHARMACIST TAKEN NOTE TO DEVOTE OURSELVES TO THE LIFETIME OF SERVICE TO OTHERS TO THE PROFESSION OF PHARMACY. AND IN DOING SO PROMISED TO CONSIDER THE WELFARE OF HUMANITY. AND THE RELIEF OF SUFFERING AS OUR PRIMARY CONCERN. AS WITH THIS IN MIND THAT THE CALIFORNIA FARM ASSOCIATION HAVE ALWAYS SUPPORTED A WORKABLE. SUSTAINABLE PRESCRIPTION DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM FOR CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. WITH GIVES HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS A MEANINGFUL WAY TO ENSURE THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ARE PRESCRIBE AND DISPENSE SAFELY AND APPROPRIATELY. CPJ HAS SUPPORTED THE LEGISLATION WHICH ESTABLISHED HERE'S TWO POINT NOW. WELL WE ACKNOWLEDGE IT IS A BETTER SYSTEM ITS PREDECESSOR IT IS LACKING THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE PHARMACISTS WITH THE BENEFIT OF THE INTEGRATED WORK FLOW SYSTEM. THE RECENT PASSAGE OF AB FORTY COMMITTEE INTERFACING WITH SOFTWARE PROVIDES ABILITY FOR MEMBERS ON BEHALF OF THE HEALTHCARE TEAM TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE HEALTHCARE RECORD OF A PATIENT. INCLUDING THE INFORMATION CURES THIS IS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT WHICH RESULT IN BETTER AND VERY TIMELY CARE FOR PATIENTS. ALONG WITH OUR COLLEAGUES IN MEDICINE WE SEE FIRSTHAND THE DEVASTATING IMPACT OF PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE IT IS TRULY A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS WHICH IS PLAYING EVERY COMMUNITY IN OUR STATE. THE DELIVERY OF HEALTHCARE HAS CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE YEARS IT IS NO LONGER PROVIDED BY AN INDIVIDUAL BUT BY AN INTER DISCIPLINARY HEALTH CARE TEAM WHICH INCLUDES PARTS. THIS MODEL PROVIDES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO TREAT THE WHOLE PATIENT. COLLABORATE ON THEIR HEALTHCARE NEEDS. TOO OFTEN THAT TREATMENT NOW INCLUDE SUBSTANCE ABUSE CURES PROVIDES MEMBERS OF THIS TEAM A TOOL TO TRACK THE MEDICATION USE OF OUR PATIENTS. WELL USEFUL IS STILL LACKING A FEW KEY PIECES OF INFORMATION. IN ORDER FOR ALL MEMBERS OF THE HEALTHCARE TEAM TO SHARING CASE MANAGEMENT THE PATIENT THE MEDICAL HISTORY INCLUDING BEHAVIOR PRIOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE OVERDOSE HISTORY. WOULD BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT PERMISSION TO HAVE ACCESS IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE RISK OF ABUSE. ADDITIONALLY UNDER OUR CURRENT SYSTEM HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS ARE LIMITED TO THE INFORMATION WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA TOO. CURIOUS TO POINT OUT SYSTEM. WE DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO TRACK THE PROCESS PATIENTS PRESCRIPTION USES ACROSS OUR BORDERS. INTERSTATE IMMIGRATION IS KEY TO ADDRESSING THAT PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE CRIME. IN ADDITION TO THIRTY NINE STATES OUR NEIGHBORING STATES UTILIZE A SYSTEM WHICH RIGHTS HEALTHCARE TEAM ACCESSIBILITY TO ACCESS TO HEALTH RECORDS OF PATIENTS FROM STATES. WHICH USE AN INTEGRATED INTERSTATE SYSTEM. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A LEADER IN MANY SIGNIFICANT HEALTH POLICIES ABORTING THIS IS NOT THE CASE FOR TRACKING THE MEDICATION REALIZATION THE MEDICATION RECORDS COURSE THIS LOOKS. THERE ARE DO YOU AND OUR EXISTING MODELS THAT WORK CALIFORNIA PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION URGES THIS BODY TO STUDY THOSE MODELS. AND IMPLEMENT THEM IN CALIFORNIA. CBJ LOOKS FOR TO WORKING WITH THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AND OUR COLLEAGUES IN HEALTH CARE TO DEVELOP A WELL THOUGHT OUT PLAN WHICH MEANS OUR COLLECTIVE GOAL OF PROVIDING CARE TO CALL CAL. JUST A. MY NAME IS LEE SNARK I AM A. CHRONIC PAIN SPECIALIST IN SACRAMENTO BEEN WORKING FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS AND ESPECIALLY PAIN MEDICINE. AND REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. I'M BOARD CERTIFIED IN ANESTHESIOLOGY INTERNAL MEDICINE ADDICTION MEDICINE PAIN MEDICINE AND I'M A MEDICAL REVIEW OFFICER. CHAU I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED. FOR MANY YEARS IN PRESCRIBING CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC PAIN. THE OLD RECALL THE INTRACTABLE PAIN ACT AND SOME OF THE THINGS WHO WENT INTO. HELPING US MANAGE INTRACTABLE PAIN. IN FACT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED BILL NOT THAT LONG AGO THAT MANDATED A CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION SO THAT WE COULD LEARN HOW TO PRESCRIBE MEDICATIONS MORE SAFELY. ASKED ESPECIALLY ON OUR UNDERSTANDING HAS EVOLVED TO BECOME SMARTER ABOUT THINGS. WE HAVE. WORKED TO REFINE OUR BILL USED TO MANAGE PATIENTS. NOW. THERE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF EXPERT TESTIMONY THIS IS A VERY VERY COMPLEX ISSUE. WHEN WE MET WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA PART RING WITH TERROR. CALLINGS. TO UPDATE THE ABOARD RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CONTROLLED SUBS PRESCRIBING WE RECOGNIZE THAT ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL. REGRADED THE GUIDELINE WITH THE PREAMBLE OF EIGHT TO TEN PAGES IT COVERS EVERYBODY. AND THEN HAD SUB CATEGORIES OF OUT PATIENT SPECIFIC POPULATIONS OF FOR EXAMPLE PEDIATRICS ELDERLY CARE A CANCER PAIN MANAGEMENT ADDICTIVE DISORDERS. AND OTHERS WERE CONSIDERED IN OUR FORWARD THINKING AND COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL OR CALIFORNIA TREATMENT GUIDELINES. THIS IS VERY PORTENDED PROCEED AS NOTED THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL TREATMENT GUIDELINES. WHICH WERE DIRECTED PRIMARILY AT PRIMARY CARE. THE MEDICAL BOARD CALIFORNIA TREATMENT GUIDELINES COVER ALL CARE ALL SPECIALTIES REPRESENTS ALL POSITIONS PRICING IN THE STATE. AS AA IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF OUR MANAGEMENT OF THESE PATIENTS AN ELECTRONIC PRESCRIPTION MONITORING PROGRAM HAS ALWAYS BEEN SUPPORTED. IN FACT WE'VE SUPPORTED THE NATIONAL. NASCAR PROGRAM IT WAS SIGNED BY GEORGE W. BUSH AND IS STILL BEEN INADEQUATE FUNDED BY CONGRESS. WE THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT IT INTERSTATE ELECTRONIC PRESCRIPTION MANTRA BE AVAILABLE. BUT WE COULD CONTROL IS WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS IN CALIFORNIA TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC INTEREST OF BEST. PATIENT CARE WE COULD PROVIDE AND WE'VE SUPPORT IN THE ELECTRONIC PRESCRIPTION MARK PROGRAM KNOWN AS JURORS IN CALIFORNIA. NOW AS WE HAVE SUPPORTED THAT. IN WE'RE GROWING. BY WITH ALL OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN TESTIFIED TO. HER TO CONTINUES TO BE SOME PROBLEMS ARE I DO WANNA I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT. THE OVERALL TENOR OF THIS OF THE PRESENTATION THIS MORNING NEWS IS DIRECTED AT OPIOID MISUSE OPIATE ABUSE AND HOPE YOU DEDUCTION. BUT I WOULD REMIND EVERYBODY THAT THE INCIDENCE OF ADDICTION IS ARGUABLY SOMEWHERE AROUND FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THE POPULATION. THAT WOULD LEAVE EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION THAT IS IS. AT RISK FOR NOT HAVING ACCESS TO THESE MEDICATIONS. CURRENTLY CURRENTLY SIMPLY PRESCRIBING AN OPIOID. IS STIGMATIZED JUST AS. WELL FOR FOR PRACTITIONERS LIKE ME IS IS INCREASINGLY VERY DIFFICULT TO PROVIDE COMPLEX MEDICAL. SOLUTIONS THAT MAY INVOLVE POLYPHARMACY OR COMBINE MEDICATIONS BECAUSE OF ME. LIMITATIONS ON WHAT YOU CAN PRESCRIBE A YOU'VE HEARD TESTIMONY ABOUT RED FLAGS AND DANGEROUS COMBINATIONS. SOMETIMES COMPLEX MEDICAL CONDITIONS REQUIRE. COMPLEX SOLUTIONS IT IS NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL WORLD. AND UNFORTUNATELY SOME PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC PAIN MANY OF WHOM I'VE HAD THE PRACTICE FOR DECADES ARE FINDING IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN MEDICATIONS. BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT THINKING ABOUT MAXIMUM DOSAGE LIMITATIONS AND THAT SORT OF THING. WHICH IN A GENERAL WAY WAS GOOD BUT IN A SPECIFIC WAY MAY NOT BE FOR CERTAIN PATIENT POPULATIONS. SO. OUR CURRENT CONCERNS ABOUT JURORS IS THAT. WE'VE SEEN IMPROVED FUNCTIONALITY OVER THE EARLIER VERSIONS AND WE APPLAUD THAT. WE'VE BEEN INVOLVED THE BETA TESTING AND AND AS SUGGESTING. SOLUTIONS TO IMPROVING. ITS. A UTILITY. A COUPLE OF THINGS OF CONCERN A WAGON DATA REPORTING IS A CURRENT SEVEN DAY REQUIREMENT PERFORMANCES. IT LEAVES A GAP IN WHICH A TRUE DOCTOR SHOPPER COULD OBTAIN INFILL MULTIPLE PRESCRIPTIONS PER PER DATA WHICH OPEN AND CURES. DATABASE SIMILAR TO PRESCRIBE OR THE PHARMACIST. AND SHE MAYES ADVOCATED CONTINUES TO SUPPORT EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE REPORTING TIMELINE FOR PHARMACISTS WHICH COULD MAKE A LARGE IMPACT ON THE SYSTEM'S USEFULNESS. AND SADLY. THEY'RE STILL VERY FREQUENT PROBLEMS WITH THE SYSTEM KICKING USERS OFF. AS YOU'RE TRYING TO PULL PATIENT REPORTS OR NOT I MEAN ALLOWING THEM TO LOG IN. NO NO I WORK WITH. THE DOJ AND EARLY VERSIONS SAYS DURING PORTENT CLINICAL PRACTICE LIKE MINOR OR IN PRACTICE FOR THAT MATTER. IF WE'RE GOING TO FULLY IMPLEMENT CURES DATABASE AND WE NEED TO BUILD ACCESS THROUGHOUT THE OFFICE. IN MY PRACTICE WE. DO A HUNDRED PERCENT CURES. REVIEW WE ACTUALLY. A DOWNLOAD THE. CURES REPORT. AND APPENDEDTO THE OFFICE REPORTS ON ALL MY PATIENTS DEMOCRATIC PAIN PRACTITIONERS SO THAT'S THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF MY MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT PATIENTS. PATIENTS AWARE OF ALL OF THIS STUFF AS WAS DONE PREVIOUSLY TESTIFIED TO. OF PATIENT AGREEMENT OR CONTROLLED SUBSEQUENT IS ALSO COMPONENT OF A PRACTICE. WHERE YOU'RE PRESCRIBING CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE? CHAU AS PART OF THE PARTNERSHIP OF PROVIDING SAFE. MEDICAL PRACTICE THAT THE PATIENTS ARE AWARE THAT THIS DOES IS GOING ON. SO WE SHOULD CONTINUE HAVE INFORMATION. TECHNOLOGY PROBLEMS. A PERHAPS THERE COULD BE SOME SHOPPING IMPROVEMENTS IN THE DOJ. AND OUR CONCERN ABOUT MANDATING A SYSTEM THAT MAY NOT BE READY FOR PRIMETIME IS THAT IT IT IT IT UNFAIRLY IMPACTS A PRACTITIONER. IN AND TRYING TO PROVIDE A A MANDATED. DOCUMENTATION THAT WERE UNABLE TO TO PROVIDE. ALSO IMPORTANTLY THE CURE SYSTEM IS DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER STATES IN CRITICAL WAYS IT IN HIS HOUSE INTO LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITY. AND. FOR THE PAINT COMMUNITY OF MINING OF CURSE DATA AND AND. FINDING AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN PRESCRIBE MEDICINES AND PRESUMING. THAT THE. AS IT'S BEEN DESCRIBED INCOMPETENT DANGERS POSITIONS A MAY NOT NECESSARILY CORRELATE. THESE ARE NECESSARILY RED FLAGS AND THERE'S NO IS AN IMPLICATION THAT PHYSICIANS ARE PRODUCTION FOR MEDICINE AND THERE MAY NOT BE TRUE. BUT AGAIN CURSES HIS HOUSE IN A LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITY. IT DOES NOT HAVE THE REQUIRED ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT INCLUDES PROVIDERS USED TO SYSTEM THAT DEPTH ELECTION HAPPENS WHO WE COULD PROVIDE FEEDBACK. ABOUT THIS UNDERMINE ITS ABILITY TO FUNCTION AT ITS HIGHEST POTENTIAL AS A PUBLIC HEALTH TOOL. AND TO EFFECTIVELY MEET THE NEEDS PROVIDERS WHICH IS COLONEL TOO TO ENSURING THE SUCCESS OF THE PRESCRIPTION MARKER PROGRAM. WE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL SAY ISSUES ASSOCIATION STRONGLY SUPPORT ELECTRONIC PRESCRIPTION MONITORING PROGRAM IN SUPPORT TO CURES. SYSTEM. WE PREFER A BEHIND US IN A NON LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITY. SO THAT IS SERVICES FUNCTION FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. AND I THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PROVIDE COMMENTS LIKE VERY MUCH CREDIT YOU VERY MUCH AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE TO BE AT THIS ROOM AND ABOUT TEN MINUTES OR SO BUT. IF WE CAN COMING CATHOLIC THIS COMES BY KNOW THAT MANY OF YOU HAVE TRAVELED QUITE THE DISTANCE TO BE HERE TODAY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH ON IT NOW GO ON TO. DOCTOR DAVID RENDON. ANY. AS WE ARE THIS MORNING THE OPIATE EPIDEMIC IS A BIG PROBLEM IN THEIR STE NATION AND OUR STATE. BUT IT HASN'T BEEN A BIG ISSUE IN MY PROFESSION OF OPTOMETRY. CALIFORNIA LAW ALLOWS OPTOMETRIST TO PRESCRIBE ONLY TO CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. HYDROCODONE TRAMADOL AND LIMITS THE A PRESCRIPTION DATE TWO THREE DAYS. AN OPIATE PRESCRIPTION CAN BE NEEDED BY AT TOM JUST PROPOSED SURGICAL CONTROL PAIN AND TO TREAT AYE INJURIES. THE MOST OPTOMETRISTS MORE CALMLY MANAGE THE PAIN WITH BANDAGE CONTACT LENSES AND AL ANALGESICS LIKE IBUPROFEN AND NAPROXEN. OFTEN A MORE OBVIOUS IN OPTOMETRY WHEN A PATIENT'S CONDITION WOULD REQUIRE OPIATES BECAUSE THE PAIN IS PHYSICALLY NOTICEABLE. AS THE SHIP THEY HAVE SOMETHING LIKE CORNEAL ABRASION OR FOREIGN BODY IN THEIR EYE. THERE'S NOT A LOT OF THE DATA AVAILABLE ON HOW OFTEN THAT TOM JUST PRESCRIBE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES HOWEVER UNDER THE MEDICARE SYSTEM IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THERE WERE ABOUT FOUR POINT THREE MILLION PRESCRIPTIONS. DESCRIPTIONS WRITTEN BY OPTOMETRISTS IN U. S. AND OF THOSE SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY THREE WERE FOR OPIATES. THAT'S ZERO POINT ZERO THREE OPIATE PRESCRIPTION RATE. AND THIS DOESN'T INCLUDE THE NUMBER OF YOUNGER PATIENT YOU MIGHT HAVE WORK RELATED INJURIES THEY CAN CAUSE PAIN BUT IT DOES SUGGEST OVERALL WOULD PRESCRIBING. LAPTOP PURCHASE IS VERY LOW. I DON'T TYPICALLY PRESCRIBED IN IN MY PRACTICE IN FACT IN PREPARATION FOR DID A WE CANNOT FIND A PRACTICING UP TOM JUST THAT HAD USED IN THE CARE SYSTEM. NEVERTHELESS THE AMERICAN OPTOMETRIC ASSOCIATION HAS DISTRIBUTED SPECIFIC GUIDELINES TO DOCTORS OF OPTOMETRY. REGARDING THE ROLE IN PROTECTING THEIR PATIENTS AND FOR RISKING AN INAPPROPRIATE USE OF OPIOIDS. SO THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SHARE MY PERSPECTIVE THIS MORNING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'M GOING TO A DOCTOR UPDIKE WHO ALSO HAPPENS COINCIDENTALLY TO THE FROM SENECA COUNTY. GOOD MORNING. CHAIR MEMBER COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE. LITTLE STRANGE HAVE A DOCTOR OF CHIROPRACTIC YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT OPIOIDS BOMB BUT WERE A LITTLE BIT. ON AS OPPOSED TO ALL THE WORK YOU'RE DOING ON DEALING WITH THE ISSUE. WE WORK ON THE FRONT END. WE BELIEVE AND THAT'S A GOOD DATA TO SUPPORT THAT IF YOU GET THE RIGHT CONSERVATIVE CARE AT THE FRONT END OF A PROBLEM. THAT SOMEBODY HAS RELATED TO. MUSCLE SKELETAL ORTHOPEDIC PROBLEM. YOU ACTUALLY DON'T END UP NEEDING TO HAVE A LOT OF MEDICATIONS. I WORK IN A VERY INTEGRATED. ONSITE MEDICAL CENTER AT CISCO MANAGED BY STANFORD AND WE WE HAVE PRETTY MUCH ALL OF THE STANDARD PROVIDERS THEIR ON SITE FOR THE EMPLOYEES. OBVIOUSLY MEDICAL DOCTORS. MULTIPLE DIFFERENT MEDICAL SERVICES OUR PHYSICAL THERAPY CHIROPRACTIC ACUPUNCTURE WE HAVE MENTAL HEALTH. COUNSELING. HOW WILL SEVERAL PHARMACY AND LAB WE HAVE DENTAL WE'VE DIVISION CENTER I'M SO EVERY IT'S A ONE STOP SHOP FOR STUFF THAT YOU WOULD TYPICALLY WANT TO GO TO IT AND? I'M JUST USE A LITTLE BIT OF DATA AND TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WE RAN THE NUMBERS IN OUR PHARMACY THE LOOKED AT. PRESCRIBING HABITS OF THE DOCTORS THAT WROTE PRESCRIPTIONS TO OUR PHARMACY FROM OUTSIDE AND FROM INSIDE. AND. WHILE THE DOCTORS INSIDE THE CLINIC WROTE THIRTY SIX PERCENT OF THAT TOTAL PRESCRIPTIONS THAT WERE FILLED. OUT OF THIRTY ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND PRESCRIPTIONS. ARE PROVIDERS ONLY WROTE SIX PERCENT OF THE OPIOID PRESCRIPTIONS SO YOU WOULD THINK IF THERE WAS A. LEVEL PLAYING FIELD THAT THEY WERE EVERYBODY WAS PRACTICING THE SAME THEY'D BE WRITING UP A THIRD. OR SO OF THOSE PRESCRIPTIONS. I'M SORRY I MISSED A. YEAH. ROUGHLY THAT AMOUNT. AND BUT THE THE POINT BEING THAT WHEN YOU HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THE PROVIDERS THAT CAN HELP PEOPLE IN THEIR IN PAIN ON THE FRONT END. WHETHER IT'S THROUGH THE REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM OUR A CLINIC THAT'S AVAILABLE. AND WE CAN HELP PEOPLE FROM NOT HAVING TO MEET THE OPIOIDS AND END UP IN THIS NEGATIVE SPIRAL THAT'S CREATED THIS PROBLEM FOR CALIFORNIA SO. I THINK I'LL KEEP MY COMMENTS. RIGHT THERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. TAKING. BURNING. THANK YOU SYMBOL AND REMEMBER LOW. AND THE MEMBERS FOR YOU BY ME HERE MY NAME IS A DOCTOR IN THE MY TECHIE. AND I'M A PRACTICING PHYSICIAN. YOU IN OAKLAND AND BERKELEY ON PRACTICE. AS INTEGRATING MEDICINE DOCTOR WHICH IS A MEANS I DO PRESCRIBE THE PAIN MEDICATION OPIOID MEDICATIONS BUT ALSO I ADD ACUPUNCTURE TO MY PRACTICE OF FOR THE LOSS THE FIFTEEN YEARS. DISAVOW THE NOTE I'M CURRENTLY ON THE ACUPUNCTURE BORED AS THE PRESIDENT BUT IT TODAY I'M HERE NOT A REPRESENT OF THE ACUPUNCTURE BOARD. AND BUT I WANT TO SHARE YOU KNOW FULL ALL THE PANELS HERE A THANK YOU GUYS FOR BEING THE PARTNER TOGETHER COLLABORATE TO TO TAKE CARE OF OUR PATIENTS AS A SEWING IMPORTANT. I SEE THE PAYING WITH THE MY PATIENTS I REMEMBER EARLY MISS THE GIPSON WAS A TALKING ABOUT A COULD YOU GUYS TO STOP PRESCRIBING. PAIN MEDICATION MA I JUST OPENED UP I SAID IN MY PATIENTS WOULD KILL US AND YOU KNOW AS A PHYSICIAN YOU CAN TO SEE OUR PATIENTS THIS OFFER. SO THERE IS A REALLY LIMITED TO TO USE FOR US TO YOU KNOW HELP ABOUT PATIENTS SO HERE I WANT TO SEE ACUPUNCTURE ACTUALLY HAS BEEN REALLY. INTEGRATED THE TWO OF A HOSPITAL SYSTEM. I GET IT NICKNAMED AS A DOCTOR HAPPY SO IF YOU GUYS ARE THINKING YOU WANNA YA PATIENTS HAPPY Y. YA STAFF AND PHYSICIANS LESS BURNED OUT AND HE'LL NURSING STAFF. UNLESS BURNED OUT BY THE STREAMING PATIENTS THINKING ABOUT A CALL OF ACUPUNCTURE TEAM. AND A WE STARTED AT THE. ACUPUNCTURE CHINESE MEDICINE RESIDENCY PROGRAM A YOUNG HIGHLAND HOSPITAL TWO YEARS AGO HAS BEEN BECOME REALLY POPULAR IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM. POST OPERATION I SEE YOU ALSO ONCOLOGY INFUSION CONDUCT. SO I WANT TO KEEP MYSELF SHORT IF AS AND YOU QUESTIONS I'M HERE TO ANSWER AND THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE CHANCE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ASSEMBLY IT IS THE MOST OF. DIFFICULT PRACTICE TO DEAL WITH IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE A DOCTOR AND PAIN MANAGEMENT AND AND CERTAINLY IN OUR AREA WE'VE HAD. SOME OF THE PAIN MANAGEMENT DOCTORS THAT WENT OFF IN THE. DIRECTION OF OF LOVE OVER PRESCRIBING OPIOIDS AND CREATING ISSUES AND ARE. A COMMUNITY WHAT I'M CURIOUS ABOUT IS HOW MUCH HAVE YOU DECREASED OPIOID. I I HEAR OPIOID PRESCRIPTIONS AND THEN YOU ALSO MENTIONED THAT. SOMETIMES PEOPLE WITH LONG TERM. CARE REALLY DO OF REQUIRE OPIOIDS AND IT SEEMS THAT THE THE ONE I'VE BEEN READING LATELY IS THAT THERE'S NOW NEXT. FEELINGS ON LONG TERM. USE OF OPIOIDS TO TREAT CHRONIC. DISEASE SO MAYBE YOU CAN SHINE A LIGHT ON. OKAY THANK YOU. THE. RISK BENEFIT RATIO FOR OPIOIDS. A COMPARABLE DE OTHER MEDICATIONS WERE AVAILABLE TO US IN THE LAST THIRTY TO FIFTY YEARS. ANNOUNCED ROYALS. PREDNISONE. YEAH MEMORY STABILIZE MEDICATIONS ANTI SEIZURE MEDICINES ANTIDEPRESSANT MEDICATIONS THAT TYPE OF STUFF WE WOULD USE AN INTERNAL MEDICINE PRACTICE. FOR. IN IN COMBINATION. WE WOULD USE COMMON I COME BY MEDICATIONS FOR ANY OTHER CHRONIC ILLNESS HEART DISEASE LUNG DISEASE KIDNEY DISEASE RHEUMATOLOGIST DISEASE THOUGH IT IT IS IT'S VERY CONSISTENT WITH AN INTERNAL MEDICINE APPROACH TO. A INTRACTABLE DISEASE ENTITY TO USE COMBINE TO MEDICATIONS. NO. S. ESPECIALLY A PAIN MEDICINE IS INVOLVED OVER THE YEARS. WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIND WHAT'S THE METRIC HOW DO WE MEASURE BEAUSE IT'S EIGHT IT'S INHERENTLY A SUBJECTIVE. DISEASE PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU WHAT THEY FEEL. SO WEEK KNOWING TO RISE TO RIGHT METRICS TO MEASURE THAT THE IMPORTANT THING IS A IS AN ASSESSMENT FUNCTION. IN ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING AN ESSENTIAL. AYE ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING TO IT MEASURE THAT. AND WE JUST PRESCRIBE THE AMOUNT OF MEDICATIONS THAT WE THAT. YEAH. CORRELATED WITH. THAT BENEFIT FOR THE PATIENTS NOW AS A CONSEQUENCE OF. MORPHINE EQUIVALENT DOSAGES AND AN ARBITRARILY CAPS BEING PLACED ON PRESCRIBING. THERE'S BEEN AN OVERWHELMING OF PRESSURE TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT THE MEDICATION YOU'RE GIVING. WHICH IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES BURGER SOME PATIENTS GET BETTER NAY SAYS I'M GLAD I MARK THIS MEDICATION BUT NOT EVERYBODY. THEIR NUMBER PATIENTS DON'T DO WELL. AND ALSO LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT. METHADONE MAINTENANCE. WERE. OPIATE USE DISORDER IS A HARM REDUCTION STRATEGY. ALSO ONE EMPHASIZING PEOPLE ARE FINE IS AN OPIOID. IT WAS OUR TAKING AWAY OPIOIDS YOU ARE NOW INCOMPARABLE DISEASES ALCOHOLISM WAS WAS. MENTIONED ALCOHOLISM. YOU KNOW HIS CLASSIC FORMAT IS AN ABSENCE PROGRAM AN ABSENCE PROGRAM ZERO ALCOHOL THERE'S NO ALCOHOL MAINTENANCE PROGRAM. SOME OF THE NEWER MEDICATIONS LIKE VALTREX THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S VERY PROMISING NOW IN THE TREATMENT OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS IS RELATIVELY NEW. JERRY WE DON'T HAVE LONG TERM DATA ON THAT. AS A PAIN SPECIALIST USED TO PUT OUR FEET FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT IS VERY EFFECTIVE FOR SOME PATIENTS BUT LIKE WITH ANY OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL. ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL AND THE BEAUTY OF OUR MEDICAL BOARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES CITY ALLOWS FOR INDIVIDUAL VARIATION. GROUP WITH WITH THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDER POSITION IN MY CASE WITH THE PATIENT TO TAILOR THE PROGRAM. SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT PATIENT BASED UPON THE METRICS WE TALKED ABOUT. USING KNICKERS IN SOME OF THESE OTHER STUFF IS A COMPONENT TO THE TREATMENT PLANT TO HELP US BE CLINICALLY MORE EFFECTIVE. IN MY PRACTICE BECAUSE OF THE THE POLITICS OF WHAT'S GOING ON IT'S REALLY POLITICAL IN MANY WAYS. IT AS I'D EMPHASIZE YOU KNOW WERE WERE WERE DIRECTING TOWARDS ADDICTIVE. THE ADDICTIVE PROBLEM THE OP WAIT. EPIDEMIC BUT KEEP IN MIND OUT OF THE SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT DIED WHEN YOU PARSE THAT DOWN. YOU KNOW TWO THIRDS OF IT IS. PARA ONE AND FENTANYL. SO IN IN A IN NO WAY DO I WANNA. TWO. DIMINISH THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT'S OF THAT FACTOR. BUT WHEN YOU START DE AGGREGATING THE DATA WE WOULDN'T WE START LOOKING A PRESCRIPTION USE. DIVERSION OR ABUSE IT STARTS COMING DOWN VERY VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF OF THE DESKS ARE FROM PATIENTS THAT ARE TAKING THE MEDICATIONS AS PRESCRIBED. AND AND THAT WAS MY MIND. CONCERNED WHEN I TALK WITH THE SENATE FOR DISEASE CONTROL WHEN THEY CAME OUT THEY SAID WE'RE NOT SPUR SPURS ARGO BICU IS AT ALL WELL. AS AN ANESTHESIOLOGIST IF WE DID MANAGE PER AB PAIN. WELL PATIENTS WOULD HAVE INCREASED INCIDENCE OF PNEUMONIA THAT WOULDN'T HEAL AS WELL AND ON AND ON SO EFFECTIVE ANALGESIA WAS A CORNERSTONE OF ANESTHESIA MANAGEMENT AND THAT'S AN ACUTE SITUATION. IN MY CLINICAL PRACTICE IT'S A CHRONIC SITUATIONS IT'S A DIFFERENT ANIMAL. BUT. WE YOU KNOW WE ANSWERED A QUESTION YOU KNOW WE ARE REDUCING THE MEDICATIONS AS BEST WE CAN BUT THERE ARE SOME THERE'S GOING. COHORT OF PATIENTS THAT THAT'S JUST NOT THE BEST MEDICAL PRACTICE IN AM ALL I WANNA DO IS. IS BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A REASONABLE CARE BASED UPON THE BEST AVAILABLE EVIDENCE TO US AT THIS TIME AND THAT SHOULD NOT BE LIMITED TO AN ARBITRATED ARBITRARY DOSAGE OR COMBINATION OF MEDICATIONS. FOR A SELECT GROUP OF PATIENTS. AS A PAIN SPECIALIST THAT THAT'S MY REQUEST AND THEN AND I CAN CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S BEING. WE KNOW OUR READY PEOPLE HEAL FASTER IF THEY'RE NOT IN PAIN IT'S FOR THE QUESTION OF. OF HOW YOU GET THERE. WITHOUT CREATING OTHER. SOCIAL PROBLEMS AND THEN JUST RIVER I BY NO ALMOST JUST ONE REAL QUICK QUESTION I THINK A COUPLE OF YOU MANDATE OF MENTIONED. THAT THERE'S NO INTERSTATE INTEGRATION AND AND MAYBE DOCTOR DANTE CAN I DIDN'T QUITE CATCH YOU SAID THIRTY NINE STATES USE SOMETHING LIKE CURIOUS BUT ARE THERE ARE ANY OF THEM INTEGRATED ACROSS. BORDERS. MAYBE I MISUNDERSTOOD. I'M IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE SOME STATES THAT DO HAVE SOME IMMIGRATION WE CURRENTLY DO NOT SO WE WOULD LIKE TO LOOK INTO THAT AND HAVE OUR STATE. BECAUSE WE ARE SO CLOSE TO OTHER NEIGHBORING STATES AND EVEN IN SACRAMENTO I PRACTICE AND I'M THE RETAIL PHARMACISTS WHO TRAVELS SO I DON'T HAVE A HOME SITE. I SEE PATIENTS FROM OTHER STATES COMING INTO OUR STATE I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THEIR INFORMATION. IT WILL BE VERY HELPFUL AS A PROVIDER TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THE BEST POSSIBLE CARE. ESPECIALLY BECAUSE HOW CLOSE WE ARE TWENTY THREE STATES TO HAVE A SYSTEM THAT COULD AT LEAST TALK TO THE OTHERS. AND DO YOU KNOW IF WORK IS BEING DONE TO AND A GREAT. CURRENTLY I DO NOT HAVE THAT IN FRONT OF ME BUT I CAN GET MY STUFF TO GET BACK TO YOU. DENVER FOR. A QUESTION FOR DOCTOR REDMOND WITH RESPECT TO THIS NOTION OF DOCTOR SHOPPING DO YOU DO YOU FEEL ALSO WOULD APPLY TO THE FIELD OF ATOMIC TREE. I DON'T BELIEVE SO SINCE WE'RE LIMITED ONLY THREE DAYS TREATMENT IT JUST DON'T SEE IT HAPPENING. OKAY OKAY AND THEN. FOR PERHAPS A DR APPT I CAN A DOCTOR PATAKI WITH RESPECT TO. OPIOIDS AND THE COMPLIMENTARY PRACTICE OF AND THAT WILL PUT YOU PROVIDE AND IT DEEP WOULD YOU BELIEVE THAT AND SITE DO BELIEVE THEY ARE COMPLEMENTARY. AT WITH RESPECT TO THAT OF THE SERVICES THAT PROVIDE IN THAT OF OPIOIDS OR. NOT. WILL GENERALLY SINCE WORK WE DON'T PROVIDE DRUGS WE DON'T DO SURGERY MOST OUR PATIENTS AREN'T ON OPIOIDS. I THINK YOU PRACTICE MORE IN A WORKERS COMPENSATION PRACTICE THERE'D BE A MUCH HIGHER RATE OF THAT. BUT IN MY THIRTY YEARS OF PRACTICING A BIT IN MANY DIFFERENT SETTINGS AND THAT'S REALLY THE ONLY TIME IN MY WORLD WHERE PEOPLE ARE IN SO MUCH PAIN THEY NEED TO BE ON OPIOIDS. BUT IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE GETS ALONG PRETTY WELL WITHOUT HAVING TO GO TO THAT. LEVEL OR THEY CAN USE THEM FOR A SHORT PERIOD TIME SHARE. I JUST WANNA ADDED TO ACTUALLY WITH THE WAY I IN THE HOSPITAL CURRENTLY WE HAVE A INTENSIVE CARE UNITS UP PUBLICITA ACUPUNCTURE STUDY FEASIBILITY STUDY FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT AT TWO SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY. DECREASE THE MORPHINE USE AND A CURRENT ILLEGAL AND THE EMERGENCY ROOM WE I GATHER ALL THE DATA ALSO. AND. YOU KNOW SO OF IF I MAY I WOULD OSCO CURRENTLY THE SHORTAGE OF ACUPUNCTURE GO TO THE RURAL AREA. IS THE MANY OFTHEM BECAUSE OF THE PAY YOU ISSUES YOU KNOW I'VE ACUPUNCTURIST I TO LEGAL INVESTED A HUGE AMOUNT OF THE STUDENTS. THE HIDE THAT AND WHEN THEY GET OUT THERE IS UNLIMITED INSURANCE COVERAGE YOU KNOW FOR THEM TO. GET REALLY START EXPAND THEIR PRACTICE INTO VARIOUS. AREA. PRODUCERS AND FIFTEEN SECONDS IF YOU. YEAH I JUST WANT TO ADD THAT. IT'S GENERALLY WELL RECOGNIZED AND MULTI DISCIPLINARY CARE REQUIRES ALL OF US SITTING HERE TO WORK TOGETHER. I'M REFERENCING A VERY SMALL GROUP OF PATIENTS THAT HAVE NOT RESPONDED TO THAT OR NOT RESPOND AS WELL AS A COULD I WOULD PREFER NOT PRESCRIBE ANYTHING IF I COULD AVOID IT I USE ACUPUNCTURE PACKAGE. RIGHT TRAINED IN ACUPUNCTURE IS WELL I JUST RAN OUT A LETTERS TO PUT ON THE PITCH. BUT IN A PRESCRIBED WE USE CHIROPRACTIC ALL THE TIME. AND IF SOMEBODY NEEDS GOOD EYE EXAM THEY GET THAT TO. CHAU. VERY MUCH VERY UNFAVORABLE OF COMPLEMENTARY TECHNIQUES TO DO WHATEVER YOU CAN TO AVOID. HAVING. TO BE ON A MEDICATION THE SAME WOULD APPLY TO DIABETES HYPERTENSION OR ANYTHING ELSE SO MUCH SUPPORT OF ALL THAT. CRITICAL I KNOW THAT MANY OF YOU HAVE TAKEN TIME OUT OF YOUR PERSONAL PRACTICES IN YOUR DAILY WORK ROUTINE TO BE WITH US HERE TODAY TO SHARE SOME INSIGHTS OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE WILL ALLOW FOR A PUBLIC COMMENT AT THIS POINT SO WOULD ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC LIKE TO. I SPEAK UP TO THE MICROPHONE AND WILL ALLOW YOU UP TO A ONE MINUTE FOR PUBLIC COME SO PLEASE COME TO THE MIKE. AND NAME AFFILIATION AND PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME STERILE KIRKLAND AND I'M A VICE PRESIDENT WITH SEP PUBLIC SERVICES. SAP'S ONE THE WORLD'S LARGEST PROVIDERS OF SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS. TO GOVERNMENT. ANIMA COURAGE TODAY BY THE. LISTEN DAHLE FOUR PANELS THE LEVEL OF. COOPERATION BETWEEN ORGANIZATIONS DEPARTMENTS AND THAT AND THE COMMUNITY I THINK THAT THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. COMMUNITY IS ALSO KEY TO THAT PARTNERSHIP. SO SMBS COMMITTED HELPING PUBLIC SECTOR CUSTOMERS SAW SOME OF THE LARGEST MOST COMPLEX CHALLENGES THEY HAVE INCLUDING THE OPIOID CRISIS. AS A COMPANY WE CARE DEEPLY ABOUT THIS CRISIS. ON ITS IT WOULD THIS IMPACT OUR OWN EMPLOYEES AS WELL AS THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE. WE HAVE CUSTOMERS AND HEALTH CARE PUBLIC SECTOR INDUSTRIES THAT ARE IT IS IN PARDONING TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE AND COMPASSIONATE SOLUTIONS THAT WILL REDUCE THE IMPACT OF THIS CRISIS IS HAVING ON FAMILIES AROUND THE WORLD. NOT JUST HERE IN THE U. S.. S. EP IS WORKED WITH OTHER GOVERNMENT PARTNERS IN THE U. S.. TO DEVELOP STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THE OPIATE CRISIS PACIFIC WE WE FELT THE STATE OF INDIANA WHICH IS REFERENCED BY DOCTOR FIGHT FOR IN THE FIRST PANEL. DEVELOP A DATA DRIVEN APPROACH TO LOOK GOOD DATA ANALYSIS AND PROGRAM MANAGEMENT WE DID THIS BY BRINGING SOLUTIONS THE STATE THAT ALLOWED HIM TO GAIN INSIGHT ON THE PROBLEM THAT THEY PREVIOUSLY DID NOT HAVE. NEW DOLLARS WERE ALLOCATED FOR FIVE TREATMENT FACILITIES. AND THOSE WERE SAUDIS WERE GONNA BE PLACED NEAR HIGH POPULATION AREAS. BY LEVERAGING TECHNOLOGY INDIANA BROUGHT TOGETHER DATA FROM DIFFERENT AGENCIES CLEANSE THE DATA. RAN ANALYTICS TO DETECT PATTERNS OF FAMILIES THAT LIVE IN THE RUN UP FOR US BODY COULD YOU KINDLY WRAP UP GET. I WILL. SO THEY. WHEN THE POINT I WANT TO MAKE THOSE A. RAN THE ANALYTICS TO THEN PLACED THE TREATMENT CENTERS WHERE THE DATA TOLD THEM IF THEY WERE MOST COMMONLY. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME WE APPRECIATE FURTHER CONVERSATIONS ON HOW WE CAN PARTICIPATE. TO HELP ADDRESS THE OPIATE CRISIS GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS TO MADDEN REPRESENT CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE MEMBERS THE PHYSICIAN'S WANT TO THANK YOU FOR CALLING THIS HEARING.

BUT THEN GETTING THE CARE THEY NEED BECAUSE OUR JOB IS SIMPLY TO STABILIZE THE PATIENT AND GET HIM TO THAT HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE. AT UC DAVIS THE RECENTLY INITIATED A PILOT PROGRAM WHERE THEY HAD A CERTIFIED SUBSTANCE USE COUNTS WERE PLACED IN THE MERCY DEPARTMENT ON AND A FULL TIME BASIS AND THEIR JOB WAS SIMPLY TO WORK WITH THESE FOLKS COMING IN. WITH ADDICTION ISSUES AND TRY CONNECTING TO THE SERVICES THAT THE THAT THEY NEED IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD AND AS A RESULT OUR ORGANIZATION IS LOOKING TO MAKE A BUDGET REQUEST THIS YEAR TO TRY AND EXTEND THAT ON A STATEWIDE BASIS SO GET A ONE TIME FUNDING.

WANTED THINGS AT SHADOWPROOF IS FOCUSING ON RIGHT NOW WAS TREATMENT. AND THE LACK OF TREATMENT AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HEARD FROM DOCTOR PFEIFFER IN THE VERY FIRST PANEL. WAS THAT. SHE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT TREATMENT AND AFTER SHE HAD DONE IT ABOUT THREE TIMES SHE FELT VERY COMFORTABLE. BUT IN ORDER TO. FIND OUT WHAT TO DO SHE HAD TO SEEK HELP FROM HER COLLEAGUES. I THINK THAT'S A SHAME THAT. A DOCTOR IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS TO SEEK ASSISTANCE FROM A COLLEAGUE. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS SOMETHING LIKE OP O. AID. ADDICTION I WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE. TREATMENT BE MANDATED TRAINING THAT DOCTORS IN THIS STATE. BE TREATED. BE TAUGHT HOW TO DO TREATMENT AND THAT THAT TREATMENT BE OUT RESEARCH BASED ON OUTCOMES BASED A TREATMENT.
