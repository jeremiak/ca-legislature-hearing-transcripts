GLAZERS ON OKAY. ALL RIGHT VERY GOOD WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING TODAY AND JOINING US ON THE JOINT OVERSIGHT HEARING OF THE CALIFORNIA BUREAU FOR PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION. CALIFORNIA HAS MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED PRIVATE COLLEGES WITH ROUGHLY FIFTY OF THEM IN MY DISTRICT. PRIVATE SCHOOL ROMAN -- HAS DECLINED AFTER PEAKING IN TWO THOUSAND TEN IN. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN IN THE MIDST OF THIS DECLINE WE'VE WITNESSED A SERIES OF SCHOOL CLOSURES IN THIS SECTION -- SECTOR EXCUSE ME. WE KNOW THAT THE SCHOOL SERVE NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS AND OFFER MORE FLEXIBILITY THAN TRADITIONAL COLLEGES OR UNIVERSITIES HOWEVER WE ALSO KNOW THAT MORE THAN HALF OF ALL CALIFORNIA STUDENT LOANS THAT ARE DEFAULTED ON HAVE BORROWED. AND ATTENDED A FOR PROFIT COLLEGE THE PURPOSE OF TODAY'S HEARING IS TO GAIN AN UNDERSTANDING. OF THE SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE TO ANSWERS ENSURE STUDENTS ENROLL IN QUALITY EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS THAT LEAD TO MEANINGFUL DEGREES AND GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT. IN ADDITION WE'LL ALSO HEAR FROM PANELISTS ABOUT EFFORTS UNDERWAY TO ASSIST STUDENTS THAT HAVE BEEN DISPLACED BY SCHOOL CLOSURE. SOME OF YOU MAY RECALL PRIOR HEARINGS REGARDING CLOSURES NAMELY THAT OF CORINTHIAN COLLEGE WHERE WE DISCUSS THE EDUCATIONAL AND FINANCIAL REPERCUSSIONS. FOR STUDENTS IMACTED BY AN ABRUPT INTO THEIR STUDIES. THIS IS AN EXPERIENCE MOST RECENTLY FELL BY STUDENTS AT BRIGHTWOOD COLLEGE CAMPUSES WHICH CLOSED ITS DOORS LAST DECEMBER. WHAT WE LEARNED AT THAT HEARING CONTINUES TO BE HE'S HEARING? OUR ABILITY TO SUPPORT QUALITY PROGRAMS AND PROVIDE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT IS VITAL TO STUDENT SUCCESS. WE'VE ALSO LEARNED THAT THESE CASES THAT FROM THESE CASES THAT THE STATE'S ABILITY TO PROTECT OUR TUDENTS INVESTMENT. IN COMPLETING THEIR EDUCATION IS LIMITED. IT IS MY HOPE THAT WILL SHED SOME LIGHT ON THESE AREAS TODAY% BUT THE STATE IN ITS CAPACITY CAN FACILITATE THE REALIZATION OF EDUCATIONAL GOALS FOR STUDENTS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. THAT SAID I WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE CENTER STEVE GLAZER THE CHAIR OF THE SENATE BUSINESS PROFESSIONS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE IT'S A REALLY LONG NAME -- BE A P. I GUESS THAT'S WHY WE NORMALLY CAUGHT THAT RIGHT -- IS A JOINING CONVENER TODAY AND I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU TO MAKE A FEW REMARKS. THANK YOU AT YOUR LEYVA THANK YOU FOR ALL. FOLKS ARE HERE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS YEAR AND I THINK THE HAIRS -- OPENING REMARKS I SHARE -- THESE. PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATIONAL AN INVALUABLE AND YOU TO SEE -- A TRAIL OF US SOME BROKEN HEARTS AND BROKEN WALLETS -- ALONG THE WAY AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT -- WHAT WE DO HERE AND I KNOW WHAT -- THE LEADERS OF THESE INSTITUTIONS ARE COMMITTED TO IS IT'S ALL ABOUT THE STUDENTS. AND HOW WE CAN HELP THEM SUCCEED IN LIFE AND GIVE THEM THE TOOLS TO TO BE. TO BE SUCCESSFUL -- YET US SCHOOLS CLOSING AND THE DEBT THAT STUDENTS HAVE INCURRED AND WANTED KNOW WHETHER THEY'VE GOTTEN TO THOSE GOALS THAT WE SHARE THAT THERE'S SOME QUICK QUESTIONS THERE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE TESTIMONY TODAY. TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE'RE DOING AND WHAT WE CAN DO BETTER THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIR LEYVA THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CARE GLAZER. ALRIGHT WELL WE'RE GOING TO START WITH AN OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVATE POST POST SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR. DEBBIE COCHRAN ARE YOU HERE. COME ON DOWN. DEBBIE IS EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT THE INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND STUDENT SUCCESS ALSO KNOWN AS TAKE US YOU CAN SIT WHEREVER YOU FEEL MOST COMFORTABLE. WELCOME AGAIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE INVITATION TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY -- AND FOR TO PROVIDE A BROAD OVERVIEW OF HIGHER EDUCATION OVERSIGHT -- AN OUTLINE SOME RECENT DEVELOPMENTS THAT WE SEE AS READY FOR CONSIDERATION BY YOUR COMMITTEES. THE INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS IS A NONPROFIT NONPARTISAN RESEARCH AND POLICY ORGANIZATION WITH HEADQUARTERS IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA AND WASHINGTON DC. I'M TICKETS FOCUSES ON FEDERAL IN CALIFORNIA STATE POLICY AIMED AT IMPROVING COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY EQUITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. I'M SO WHILE THE TOPIC OF TODAY'S HEARING IS THE BUREAU FOR PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EUCATION MY MY REMARKS ARE AIMED AT PROVIDING SOME OF THE BROADER CONTEXT. NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND BOTH HOW THE ROLES AND EXPECTATIONS OF OTHER OVERSEERS ARE EVOLVING AND ALSO EMERGING TRENDS -- THAT CALL FOR PARTICULAR ATTENTION IN CALIFORNIA -- UNDER FEDERAL LAW THERE ARE THREE ENTITIES THAT SHARE PRIMARY PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR OVERSEEING HIGHER EDUCATION. INSTITUTIONS THAT RECEIVE FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID. THE ACCREDITING AGENCIES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND STATE. ACCREDITING AGENCIES ARE TASKED WITH CATION QUALITY. TING AGENCIES ARE MEMBERSHIP INSTITUTIONS THAT USE PEER REVIEW TO ASSESS WHETHER INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS ARE HEARING TO TO FIND AN ESTABLISH STANDARDS. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RELIES UPON THESE AGENCIES DETERMINATIONS AB THAT OF WHETHER OF SCHOOLS ARE OF SUFFICIENT QUALITY FOR FEDERAL INVESTMENTS. REGIONAL ACCREDITING AGENCIES DEFINE IT. OUR SERVER DEFINED GEOGRAPHICAL REGION I'M IN A CREDIT MOSTLY PUBLIC AND NONPROFIT SCHOOLS NATIONAL ACCREDITING AGENCIES TYPICALLY HAVE ORE OF A CAREER FOCUS. AND OVERSEE MOSTLY FOR PROFIT COLLEGES. HISTORICALLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS FOCUSED ON COLLEGES FISCAL STABILITY IN COMPLIANCE WITH PROGRAMMATIC RULES OF FEDERAL AID PROGRAMS. I'M IN FORCES MINIMUM STANDARDS SET BY CONGRESS SUCH AS THE RULE THAT NO MORE THAN 30% OF A SCHOOL'S FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN DEFAULTERS VOTERS IN THE BORROWERS CAN FAULT IN THEIR ON THEIR STUDENT LOANS -- AND ALSO THAT FOR PROFIT COLLEGES RECEIVE NO MORE THAN FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID REVENUE FROM FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID. I'M IT ADDITIONALLY SET SOME OF THE STANDARDS OF ITS OWN SUCH AS IMPLEMENTING THE REQUIREMENT THAT CAREER EDUCATION PROGRAMS LEAVE THEIR GRADUATES WITH MANAGEABLE DEATH. THE DEPARTMENT ALSO PROVIDES STUDENT LOAN JUST CHARGERS TO STUDENTS USE QUIPPER SCHOOL CLOTHES OR DEFRAUD THEM. YES STATE APPROVE ALL EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS OPERATE WITHIN THEIR BORDERS AND ESTABLISH PROCESSES FOR HOW THEY WILL OVERSEE THESE COLLEGES. THEY ALSO ESTABLISH CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FOR THE RESIDENTS WHO ARE ENROLLED IN COLLEGES. NOW THESE RESPONSIBILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED AND AN AIDE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE ARE LEGALLY AUTHORIZED TO OPERATE IN THE STATE AND THAT THE STATE HAS A PROCESS. FOR ACCEPTING AN ACTING UPON COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SCHOOL WHEN THE CALIFORNIA THE PRIMARY ENTITY TASKED WITH THIS IS THE BPP THE PAIR OF PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION. I'M FEDERAL LAW AND REGULATION PROVIDE PARAMETERS OF EXPECTED LEVELS OF OVERSIGHT FOR EACH OF THESE ENTITIES WITH WIDELY VARYING LEVELS OF GRANULARITY. AS A FOR INSTANCE FEDERAL LAW RECOGNIZES STATES BROAD AUTHORITY TO REGULATE INSTITUTIONS AS THEY SEE FIT. WHERE'S CONGRESS IN THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAVE DEFINED VERY CLEAR TERMS AND STANDARDS FOR BOTH FEDERAL OVERSIGHT AND THAT OF ACCREDITING AGENCIES. HOWEVER THESE ROLES MAYBE EVOLVING IN WAYS THAT ARE CRITICAL FOR STATES TO UNDERSTAND. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS CURRENTLY MIDSTREAM IN A WIDE REACHING DE REGULATORY EFFORT THAT WOULD WEAKEN OVERSIGHT BY BOTH THE CREDITORS AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. FOR INSTANCE THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED CHANGES THAT WOULD EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN REGIONAL ACCREDITING AGENCIES AND NATIONAL ACCREDITING AGENCIES. IT THIS DISTINCTION IS RELIED UPON IN CALIFORNIA LAW TO BOTH TARGET OVERSIGHT AND FINES. SCHOOLS ACCREDITED BY THE REGIONAL ACCREDITOR SERVING OF CALIFORNIA THE WESTERN ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES ARE WHY ASK. ARE EXEMPT FROM BBB OVERSIGHT UNDER STATE LAW. IT IS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE STATE CAL GRANTS THE SIZE OF THE CAL GRANT THEY CAN RECEIVE -- CAN DEPEND ON WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE ACCREDITED BY WHY ASK FOR THESE PROVISIONS WOULD MAKE LITTLE SENSE OF THOSE DISTINCTIONS WERE RAISED AND FEDERAL LAW. I'M IN ANOTHER PROPOSED CHANGE CHANGE OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CURRENT RULES ALLOW ACCREDITED COLLEGES TO OUTSOURCE UP TO HALF OF AN ACADEMIC PROGRAM TO OUTSIDE ENTITIES WHICH THEMSELVES ARE UNACCREDITED -- THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED TO RAISE THAT HALFLIMIT THAT TAXPAYER SUBSIDY TO PROGRAMS OFFERED PRIMARILY BY UNACCREDITED PROVIDERS. EARLIER IN ITS NEGOTIATIONS THAT MINISTRATION PROPOSED TO ELIMINATE THAT LIMIT ENTIRELY. ALSO UNDER CURRENT FEDERAL RULES ACCREDITING AGENCIES THEMSELVES MUST COMPLY WITH A SLATE OF CRITERIA TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR ABILITY TO HOLD COLLEGES ACCOUNTABLE. AN AGENCY THAT DON'T MEET THOSE CRITERIA CAN LOSE FEDERAL RECOGNITION MEANING THAT THE AGENCIES ACCREDITATION NO LONGER ABLE TO SCHOOL TO GET FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID -- WELL ACCREDITING AGENCIES LOSING RECOGNITION AND IN THIS WAY IS INCREDIBLY RARE IT DIDN'T REACH OCCUR RECENTLY IT OCCURRED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ENDED RECOGNITION OF THE ACCREDITING COUNCIL FOR INDEPENDENT COLLEGES AND SCHOOLS OR KNOWN AS A CICS. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT A CICS WAS STILL NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH REQUIRED STANDARDS. NOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS LOOKING TO CHANGE FEDERAL RULES AROUND ACCREDITATION. SO TO ALLOW RECOGNITION OF ACCREDITING AGENCIES THAT MERELY SHOW SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE WITH THE STANDARDS NOT FULL COMPLIANCE AND IT'S FURTHER WEAKENING THE MEANING ACCREDITATION. I'M THIS IS IN ADDITION TO YOU -- OTHER CHANGESTHAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS ALREADY PROPOSED INCLUDING ELIMINATING THE FEDERAL GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT RULE THAT ENFORCES THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT'S REQUIREMENT. THAT CAREER EDUCATION PROGRAMS PREPARE STUDENTS FOR GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT AND RECOGNIZED OCCUPATION. ON THE ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO PROPOSED A SCALE BACK RULES PROVIDING STUDENT LOAN JUST CHARGES TO STUDENTS IN CONNECTION WITH FRAUD OR OTHER ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES OF THEIR SCHOOLS -- STATE LEVEL ACCOUNTING OF THE NUMBER OF THE STUDENTS WHO OF COURSE FILED CLAIMS FOR BORROWER DEFENSE DISCHARGES SHOW THAT ONE IN FIVE CLAIMANTS ARE CAP FROM CALIFORNIA. SO NONE OF THESE RULES WILL GO INTO EFFECT UNTIL JULY TWENTY TWENTY AT THE EARLIEST AND SOME OF THEM MAY BE CHALLENGED IN COURT EXTENDING THEM EVEN FURTHER. BUT THEY NONE THE LESS REPRESENT OF FAR REACHING THE REGULATORY AGENDA THAT WOULD SCALE BACK STUDENT TAXPAYER PROTECTIONS AND OPEN NEW AVENUES FOR ABUSE. THE CNGRESS IS ALSO POISED TO RE AUTHORIZE THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT -- GOVERNING FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS AND DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS HAVE WITH WIDELY DIVERGENT VIEWS ON WHAT CHANGES NEED TO BE MADE TO A PROPERLY HOLD COLLEGES ACCOUNTABLE. AS A RESULT OF ALL OF THIS ACTIVITY IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR STATES TO THINK ABOUT THE CONSUMER PROTECTION ROLLED MORE BROADLY THAN THEY HAVE IN THE PAST. TO ENSURE THAT THEIR RESIDENTS OF THE LEVEL OF PROTECTION THAT THEY DEEM APPROPRIATE REGARDLESS OF HOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROCEEDS. SO I WOULD LIKE NOW TO DISCUSS WITH YOU THREE IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE FOR PROFIT COLLEGE LANDSCAPE AND HOW THEY RELATE TO CALIFORNIA. THE FIRST -- IS THE ISSUE OF SCHOOLS THAT CLOSE UNEXPECTEDLY AND BEFORE STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO FINISH THEIR PROGRAMS. SINCE THE TWENTY FIFTEEN CLOSURE OF CORINTHIAN COLLEGES WHICH PRIMARILY AFFECTED CALIFORNIANS SEVERAL OTHER FOR PROFIT COLLEGE CHAIN SOME CLOSE THEIR DOORS. WESTWOOD COLLEGE ENROLLED PRIMARY PRIMARILY CALIFORNIANS BEFORE IT CLOSED. OF THE FIFTY SIX CAMPUSES OF MARINELLA SCHOOLS OF BEAUTY THAT BECAUSE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THIRTY NINE OF THEM THIRTY NINE OF THE FIFTY SIX WERE IN CALIFORNIA. OTHER CLOSURES INCLUDING ITT TECHNICAL INSTITUTES AND SCHOOLS OWN BY THE EDUCATION CORPORATION OF AMERICA INCLUDING BRIGHT WHAT COLLEGE. I HAVEN'T ALSO INCLUDED LARGE NUMBERS OF CALIFORNIANS. NO SCHOOL CLOSURES CAN LEAVE STUDENTS UNABLE TO FINISH THE PROGRAMS FOR WHICH THEY BORROWED TO ATTEND CAN BE DISASTROUS FOR STUDENTS. SCHOOL THAT CLOSE TEND TO BE ONES WITH RELATIVELY POOR REPUTATIONS AND EVEN STUDENTS WHO ARE ABLE TO TRANSFER THEIR COURSE WORK TO COMPLETE THEIR PROGRAM MAY NOT BE WELL SERVED. AND REPUTABLE SCHOOLS MAY NOT ACCEPT THE COURSEWORK TAKEN AT THE CLOSE SCHOOL. AND WHILE THOSE THAT ACCEPT THE COURSEWORK READILY ARE OFTEN THOSE WITH LOWER ACADEMIC STANDARDS. AS A CASE IN POINT EDUCATION CORPORATION -- THAT WAS ANNOUNCED IN DECEMBER. TWENTY EIGHTEEN AFFECTED CALIFORNIANS IT ROLLED CROSS TEN CAMPUSES OF RIGHT WOULD COLLEGE PLUS THE GOLF ACADEMY OF AMERICA. THE ONLY CALIFORNIA BASED TRANSFER OPTIONS ECA ARE PROMOTING OUR AT FOR PROFIT COLLEGES. FOR STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS WHO DO NOT TRANSFER COURSE WORK TO COMPLETE THEIR PRIOR PROGRAM. FEDERAL LAW ALLOWS STUDENTS AFFECTED BY A SCHOOL CLOSURE TO HAVE THEIR STUDENT LOANS DISCHARGED. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ALSO BEGAN RESTORING STUDENTS ELIGIBILITY FOR PELL GRANTS. CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF ALMOST TWO DOZEN STATES WITH THE STATE TUITION RECOVERY FUND KNOWN AS STRESS -- TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL OR ALTERNATIVE SOURCE OF FINANCIAL RELIEF THAT CALIFORNIA'S PROGRAM IS MORE GENEROUS THAN FEDERAL RELIEF IN A FEW WAYS. CALIFORNIA STUDENTS USE PARTICULAR PROGRAMS CLOSE NOT JUST OUR SCHOOLS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RELIEF UNDER STRESS. EVEN IF THE SCHOOL ITSELF REMAINS OPEN -- STRESS CAN HELP STUDENTS TO HAVE PRIVATE STUDENT LOAN DEBT IN ADDITION TO JUST FEDERAL STUDENT OANS I CAN EVEN HELP REIMBURSE THIRD PARTIES THAT HAVE PAID FOR TUITION WITHOUT LOANS. HOWEVER CALIFORNIA'S STRYFE ONLY REIMBURSES COSTS THAT WERE INCURRED TO PAY FOR TUITION AND NOT ANY OF THE OTHER DIRECT COSTS AT THE INSTITUTE ANY OTHER DIRECT COSTS OF COLLEGE. IN THIS WAY THE STATE'S RIFF PROGRAM IS MORE STRINGENT THAN FEDERAL DISCHARGES. I'M CALIFORNIA LEGISLATORS ARE CURRENTLY EX RECOGNIZE THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE IN THE STATE WE WANT TO APPLY SOME OF THOSE LESSONS TO THIS REFER GRAHAM AS WELL. SECONDLY -- THE WAYS IN WHICH COLLEGES USE MISLEADING AND DECEPTIVE INFORMATION TO ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO ENROLL HAS RECEIVE SUBSTANTIAL ATTENTION AND FEDERAL POLICY. FEDERAL LAW ENTITLES STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS WHO ARE MISTREATED OR LIE TO BUY THEIR COLLEGE TO GET THERE FEDERAL LOANS DISCHARGED. THIS PROVISION WAS RARELY USED UNTIL THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION -- WHEN IN COLLABORATION WITH THEN CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL KAMALA HARRIS DOCUMENTED WIDESPREAD MISREPRESENTATIONS WITH CORINTHIAN COLLEGE -- WITH CAMPUSES KNOWN AS EVEREST HE'LL THEN WHY ATTACK AND THAT JOINT INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT THE COMPANY HAD INFLATED GRADUATES LIKELIHOOD OF FINDING EMPLOYMENT ACROSS HUNDREDS OF PROGRAMS OFFERED. FOR EXAMPLE THE LOS ANGELES CAMPUS OF WHY ATTACK ADVERTISE A JOB PLACEMENT RATE OF 80%. FOR ITS AUOMOTIVE TECHNICIAN CERTIFICATE PROGRAM BUT THE RECALCULATED JOB PLACEMENT RATE WAS JUST SIT 26%. THE ONTARIO CAMPUS OF EVEREST COLLEGE REPORTED THAT 78% OF MEDICAL ASSISTING CERTIFICATE GRADUATES LANDED JOBS WHERE THE RECALCULATED RATE WAS JUST 52%. WITH OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS AFFECTED BY MISREPRESENTATIONS THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION PROMULGATED NEW RULES AND PROCESS SEES THAT PROVIDE AN EXPEDITED PATH TOWARDS RELIEF FOR STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN HARMED -- THIS INCLUDES STUDENTS FROM MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED CALIFORNIA BASED PROGRAM. I HAD MORE RELIABLE VERIFIABLE DATA ON EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES BEEN AVAILABLE TO OVERSEERS AT THE TIME THAT STUDENTS WERE BEING MISLED THE STATE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY SOME OF THESE FALSEHOODS EARLIER. SOME BUT NOT ALL RECRUITING AGENCIES REQUIRE STUDENTS TO REPLACE REQUIRE SCHOOLS TO REPORT ON GRADUATES EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES. THE CALIFORNIA DOES FOR AB REQUIRE BPP COVERED INSTITUTIONS TO REPORT. ON STUDENTS POST COMPLETION OUTCOMES EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES BUT THE DATA IS COLLECTED BY THE INSTITUTIONS THROUGH ALUMNI SURVEYS AND IS TOO INFREQUENTLY VERIFIED BY STATE THE STATE OR ANY THIRD PARTY ACTOR. THE STATE'S EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT OR AGES THROUGH THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM AND THAT DATE IS ALREADY BEING USED BY THE PUBLIC COLLEGES THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. I'M SO YET WHILE THE STRIDES HAVE BEEN MADE TO YOU TO BETTER CONNECT PUBLIC COLLEGE STUDENT RECORDS TO WAGE DATA AND TO BETTER UNDERSTAND EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES. NOTHING OTHER THAN SCHOOL REPORTED DATA EXISTS FOR PRIVATE COLLEGES. THE CALIFORNIA COULD HELP TO PROVIDE A CONSISTENT LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY ACROSS ALL SCHOOLS. BY REQUIRING COLLEGES AND WORKFORCE TRAINING PROVIDERS TO REPORT STUDENT LEVEL INFORMATION O THE BUREAU. AND FACILITATING THE CUP CONNECTION OF THAT DATA THE WAGE DATA IN ORDER TO ASSESS POST COLLEGE PERFORMANCE. DOING SO WOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR POLICYMAKERS STUDENTS AND INSTITUTIONS TO ASSESS POST COMPLETION OUTCOMES AND WOULD HELP IDENTIFY INSTANCES OF FRAUD BEFORE THEIR WIDESPREAD. FINALLY I WANT TO DISCUSS ONLINE EDUCATION. SOME POLICY MAKERS HOPE THAT ONLINE EDUCATION CAN BE THAN HELP MANY MORE STUDENTS EARN COLLEGE DEGREES THROUGH HIS JET GEOGRAPHIC REACH. FLEXIBLE SCHEDULING AND POTENTIAL TO SCALE. HOWEVER THE CHALLENGES IN THE SS IN ACADEMIC RIGOR AND STUDENT OUTCOMES CAN BE EVEN GREATER AN ONLINE EDUCATION THAN IN TRADITIONAL PROGRAMS PARTICULARLY FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS. AND THERE'S A LONG HISTORY OF OVER PRICED AND POOR QUALITY PROGRAMS LEAVING STUDENTS WITH THAT THAT'LL STRUGGLE TO REPAY. THE GROWTH OF ONLINE EDUCATION CAN COMPLICATE STATE OVERSIGHT. YOUR STATES CANNON TO REGULATE COMMERCE THAT'S CONDUCTED BY COMPANIES HEADQUARTERED OUT OF STATE. HIGHER EDUCATION OVERSIGHT IS TRADITIONALLY BEEN FOCUSED ON SCHOOLS LOCATED INSIDE THE STATE NOT THOSE OFFERING EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS ACROSS STATE LINES. MOST CALIFORNIANS ENROLLED IN ONLINE CATCH EDUCATION ARE AT CALIFORNIA BASED SCHOOLS -- AND CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN PARTICULAR. BUT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS ARE EDUCATION PROVIDE PROGRAMS OFFERED BY SCHOOLS AND OTHER STATES. MORE THAN 40% OF THESE STUDENTS ARE ENROLLED IN FOR PROFIT COLLEGES OR AT NONPROFIT COLLEGES OF QUESTIONABLE LEGITIMACY. THERE'S REASON TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE STUDENTS. OUT OF STATE INSTITUTIONS THAT AND ROLL CALIFORNIANS ONLINE HAVE WORSE STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT OUTCOMES AND CALIFORNIA BASED DISTANCE EDUCATION PROVIDERS. THREE YEARS AFTER COLLEGE 30% OF BORROWERS FROM OUT OF STATE SCHOOLS AND ROLLING CALIFORNIANS ON MINOR PAIN DOWN THEIR DEBT COMPARED DO NUMBERS FROM CALIFORNIA DISTANCED -- AND PROVIDERS. THE SHARE OF BORROWERS TO END UP IN THE FALL IS ALSO HIRE AN OUT OF STATE DISTANCE EDUCATION PROVIDERS THAN IN STATE PROVIDERS. IMPORTANTLY CALIFORNIA CANNON ACTS NEW PROTECTIONS FOR STUDENTS -- IN ROLLED OUT OF STATE BECAUSE IT HAS NOT JOINED THE INTERSTATE RECIPROCITY AGREEMENT THAT OTHER STATES HAVE. THIS AGREEMENT DEVELOPED AND MANAGED BY THE NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR STATE AUTHORIZATION RECIPROCITY AGREEMENTS COMMONLY KNOWN AS SARAH. IS DESIGNED TO STREAMLINE THE ABILITY OF SCHOOLS WITHIN THEIR OWN BORDERS TO ENROLL STUDENTS BASED ELSEWHERE. HOWEVER IN EXCHANGE FOR THE STREAMLINED PROCESS. AT PARTICIPATING STATES MUST GIVE UP THEIR AUTHORITY TO APPLY NEW OR EXISTING HIGHER EDUCATION LAWS TO SCHOOLS AND ROLE IN THE RESIDENCE. CALIFORNIA HAS NOT JOINED SERRA AND THAT'S RETAINS ITS ABILIY TO REGULATE OUT OF STATE SCHOOLS AND ROLLING CALIFORNIANS. HOWEVER IT'S DONE LITTLE WITH THIS AUTHORITY TO DATE. I'M OUT OF STATE FOR PROFIT COLLEGES MUST REGISTER WITH THE BUREAU AND PAY INTO THE STATE'S STRESS FOR EACH CALIFORNIAN ENROLLED. BUT NO OTHER CALIFORNIA HIGHER EDUCATION LAW APPLIES TO THESE SCHOOLS. AS A LEGISLATURE CONSIDERS HOW BEST TO STRENGTHEN OVERSIGHT IT SHOULD CONSIDER WHAT ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS ARE NEEDED TO PROTECT THE TATE'S RESIDENTS IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER INVOLVES. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SHARE THESE THOUGHTS. WELCOME TO QUESTIONS VERY MUCH MISS COCHRAN THAT WAS VERY HOLE ANY MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY. SURE CLOSER DID YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS -- I DO -- SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND IT'S IT'S AN INFORMATIVE AND IT'S ALSO -- TROUBLING -- I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM OTHERS ABOUT -- YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULDN'T AT SHOULD BE DOING. BUT I I I GUESS I'D LIKE TO BE PROVOCATIVE AT THE BEGINNING HERE -- YOU'VE MADE A NUMBER OF SUGGESTIONS OF OF WHERE YOU THINK WE COULD BE DOING BETTER. WOULD YOU TALK TO ME FOR A MOMENT ABOUT OUR CURRENT BUREAU THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE THAT THE END IS INVOLVED IN THESE AREAS -- WE ARE THEY INVOLVED ARE THEY NOT WHAT'S YOUR INVOLVEMENT WITH THEM OR OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM THEM IN A FEW MINUTES BUT I THINK WE BENEFIT FROM HERE. YOUR EXAMINATION ON OUR BEHALF AS TO WHERE THEY'RE GOING RIGHT AND WRONG. YEAH THAT'S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION I FEEL LIKE IT I'M NOT AS FAMILIAR CERTAINLY AS YOUR FLAWS A SUBSEQUENT PANELS WILL BE IN TERMS OF THE DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS OF THE BUREAU I THINK. IMPORTANT STRIDES HAVE BEEN MADE IN RECENT YEARS -- IMPORTANTLY THE CREATION OF THAT OF SORRY THE OFFICE OF STUDENT ASSISTANCE AND RELIEF -- I KNOW THEY'VE BEEN A VERY ACTIVE WITH SOME DEVELOPMENTS OF LATE -- I THINK WHAT IS ALSO IMPORTANT AS YOU THINK ABOUT HOW WELL THEY'RE IMPLEMENTING THAT LAWS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ON THE BOOKS IS THE THINK ABOUT WHAT NEW AUTHORITY EITHER THEY OR OTHER ENTITIES WILL NEED TO PROVIDE BACKSTOPS TO SOME OF WHAT'S HAPPENING FEDERALLY. ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY INITIATIVES THAT THEIR ADVANCE SOME OF THEM ARE PRETTY. FOR YOU WHERE THEY'VE BEEN PROBLEMS FOR A LONG TIME ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY INITIATIVES THEY'VE BEEN ADVANCING -- I AM NOT OKAY. I GUESS THAT WOULD GIVE THEM SOME TIME TO THINK ABOUT THAT QUESTION WHERE THEY GET UP HERE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WEAKENING THE ACCREDITATION PROCESS? WILL THIS THEN MAKE IT HARDER FOR STUDENTS WHO GRADUATE FROM THE SCHOOLS HARDER FOR THEM TO FIND A JOB BECAUSE WE DEAL IF THEY'RE NOT ACCREDITED WE CAN. EXTRAPOLATE OUT THAT THEY ARE PROVIDING THE BEST EDUCATION POSSIBLE. I MEAN DO YOU THINK THAT'S TRUE. YEAH I MEAN I THINK WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS WE'LL MAKE IT EASIER FOR COLLEGES TO BECOME ACCREDITED -- SAID THIS BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT DOES NOT MEAN AS I'D LIKE WHETHER OR NOT THAT ACCREDITED ACCREDITATION STANDS FOR QUALITY IS WHAT WILL CHANGE AND THAT IN TURN OF COURSE WILL MAKE IT HARDER. FOR STUDENTS GET THE EDUCATION THEY NEED AND THEN FIND AND HOLD JOBS. THANK YOU THAT WAS MY POINT I WAS TRYING TO MAKE. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE SCHOOLS THAT HAVE CLOSED -- QUITE A FEW IN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS IS THERE A COMMON THEME ARE COMMON DENOMINATOR AND WHY THE SCHOOLS CLOSED IS IT FINANCIAL IS IT -- ARE THEY NOT BEING RUN PROP -- I THINK IT WILL I THINK YOU WOULD PROBABLY FIND SOME OF BOTH OF THOSE THINGS -- YOU KNOW THAT THEY WERE NOT BE FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE -- AND THAT THE MANAGEMENT OF THE SCHOOLS WERE NOT DOING WHAT THEY NEED IT. OKAY. AND THEN WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT THE DECEPTIVE WAYS. AND WHERE DO THEY GET THEIR NUMBERS IF THE AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR PLACE WAS SAYING THAT THE PLACE WHEN SOMEONE CAME IN AND REALLY CALCULATED THAT NUMBER IS ONLY ARE THE ARE THE SCHOOLS ARE WE ARE WE LED TO BELIEVE THAT THE SCHOOLS ARE JUST MAKING THESE NUMBERS UP. I'M WITHOUT SPEAKING TO THAT PARTICULAR EXAMPLE BECAUSE NOT SURE ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR DIFFERENCE -- THERE ARE A VARIETY OF WAYS THAT SCHOOLS CAN BE -- YOU KNOW. USE RECORDS I'M IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT REPRESENT AN ACTUAL JOB PLACEMENT -- COUNTING SOMEONE WHO WAS -- EMPLOYED FOR A SINGLE DAY AND THE JOB FOR INSTANCE HAS EMPLOYED OR EVEN IN A VOLUNTEER POSITION AS EMPLOYED -- SOMETHING THAT ON PAPER MIGHT BE DOES NOT REPRESENT EMPLOYMENT IN ANY MEANINGFUL SENSE OF THE WORD GOTCHA SO MAYBE THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT WE COULD WORK ON HERE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT MY LAST QUESTION IS WHAT EXPECTATIONS -- SHOULD SIT A CALIFORNIA HAVE IN EXCHANGE FOR GRANTING PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY INSTITUTIONS THE AUTHORITY TO OPERATE. SHOULD WE EXPECT FROM THEM. NO I THINK THE EXPECTATION SHOULD BE AT ME A BROADLY SPEAKING THAT YOU'RE LEAVING CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIANS BETTER OFF AFTER THE AND ROLE THAN EFORE -- YOU MENTIONED -- CENTER LEYVA THAT THAT MORE THAN HALF OF STUDENT LOAN DEFAULTERS I'M IN CALIFORNIA HAVE ATTENDED FOR PROFIT COLLEGES AND STUDENT LOAN DEFAULT IS ONLY ONE FORM OF BORROWER DISTRESS FOR STUDENTS TO TAKE OUT LOANS TO GO TO COLLEGE. BUT IT'S ONE THAT IS A VERY CLEAR SIGN THAT STUDENTS ARE BEING LEFT WORSE OFF AFTER ENROLLMENT THEM BEFORE. OKAY VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH YES UNDER DRAWS SO. AND THEN TALK TO HIM. WITH FIRM WITH ALL OF THIS BUT YOU HAVE HERE. AFFECTED LEGAL -- THE THE ADMINISTRATION THAT FEDERAL MINISTRATION COULD EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN REGIONAL ACCREDITING AGENCIES AND NATIONAL ACCREDITING. AGENCIES I'M SORRY COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHAT WHAT THAT MEANS SURE -- SO REGIONAL ACCREDITING AGENCIES -- OPERATE WITHIN A DEFINED GEOGRAPHIC REGION -- ANNA CREDIT MOSTLY PUBLIC AND NONPROFIT SCHOOLS WHERE IS NATIONAL AGENCIES ARE GENERALLY CAREER FOCUSED IN AND A CREDIT FOR PROFIT COLLEGES. WHAT -- ONE OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSALS AROUND ACCREDITING AGENCIES WOULD -- MAKE IT HARD IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ACCREDITING AGENCIES TO LIMIT THEIR GEOGRAPHIC REGION THAT THEY SERVE IF THEY CAN'T LIMIT THEIR J. GEOGRAPHIC REGION THEN THEY WOULD BASICALLY HAVE TO BECOME NATIONAL -- AND WHAT WE WOULD SEE THEN AS WITH ALL AGENCIES BI NATIONAL IT WOULD LEAD TO A RACE TO THE BOTTOM IN TERMS OF EDUCATIONAL QUALITY. BECAUSE OF COURSE THE ACCREDITING AGENCIES ARE MEMBERS OFFENSIVE MORE MEMBERS. WITH WITH THE THAT MEANS. A STATEWIDE AS WELL. I'M AND THEY WOULD THEY WERE THE THE PROPOSAL WOULD LIMIT THE AGENCY'S ABILITY TO PUT GEOGRAPHIC BOUNDS ON IN THE SCHOOLS THEY SIR. THE CENTER DRAWS A CENTER PM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT IS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAVE IS -- ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE STATUS. OR THE HEALTH OF OUR TRADING PROCESS SO YOU KNOW FULL DISCLOSURE I ACTUALLY SERVED ON THE BOARD OF AN ACCREDITING BODY -- IN THE MEDICAL FIELD WHERE WHERE THERE ARE ACTORS ACTUALLY ONLY ONE GRADING BODY -- FOR UNDERGRADUATE ALLOPATHIC MEDICAL EDUCATION THERE'S ONE FOR RESIDENCY EDUCATION SO IN THAT CASE THERE'S ONE BODY EVERYONE LOOKS TOO BUTWHAT IS GOING ON IN TERMS OF THESE GOALS IN TERMS OF ACCREDITATION I MEAN THEY'RE JUST LIKE. THAT THAT YOU GET TO PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH ONE YOU WANT OUR HOUSE IS THERE SOME -- STANDARD DEBTS RECOGNIZE THAT THESE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT AS A WHAT IS THE CURRENT STATUS OF A TRADING BODIES AT THIS AT A FREE FOR ALL WHERE ANYONE JUST FIX THE GRADING BODY THEY WANT OR IS THERE ACTUALLY SOME SORT OF A RECOGNITION IN THE HIGHER. EDUCATION COMMITTEE THAT THESE ARE THERE'S A THERE ARE SPECIFIC ACCREDITING BODIES THAT ACTUALLY. ARE. CREDIBLE AND DO DO DO A GOOD JOB AND THAT -- AND AND THAT AND TO WHAT DEGREE IS SOMEONE SAID WHY SO I START M OWN ACCREDITING BODY RIGHT AND AND HOW HOW HOW DOES THAT WORK -- YEAH I MEAN MOST OF READY AGENCIES OUR REGION THERE EITHER EITHER REGIONALLY FOCUSED ARE FOCUSED OFTEN ON A TOP ON A SET OF YOU KNOW TYPES OF CAREERS -- YOU KNOW A PARTICULAR SET OF TRADES FOR INSTANCE -- REGIONAL ACCREDITING AGENCY YOU -- HAVE HIGHER STANDARDS AND HIGHER LEVELS OF QUALITY -- OFTEN SCHOOLS REGIONALLY ACCREDITED SCHOOLS WILL HAVE AN TRANSFER YOUR CREDITS FOR INSTANCE OF OUR OTHER REGIONALLY ACCREDITED SCHOOL THEN AND MUCH LESS SO. FROM -- NATIONAL NATIONAL ACCREDITING AGENCIES -- THAT YOUR MIND WITH OTHERS QUESTION ANY GET OUT IS IS THAT -- YEAH YOU. TO AND I'VE COLLEGES I MISSED YOUR VERBAL TEST MAY BY SEE HERE IS THAT YOU TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW REGIONAL ACCREDITATION BODIES MOVING TO NATIONAL YOU MADE SOME REFERENCE IN YOUR ANSWER TO SENATOR ALSO. I GUESS IN TERMS OF THE CURRENT HEALTH OF ACCREDITING IN HIGHER EDUCATION RIGHT NOW. IS IT DO WE HAVE A SITUATED SO FOR EXAMPLE. IF I WANT TO START MY OWN ACCREDITATION AGENCY CAN I JUST GO AND OPEN ONE AND SAY AND AS LONG AS I'M IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE -- THEN WE'RE GOOD AND THAT'S IT WE HAVE ANYTHING PEOPLE TALK ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE COLLEGES THAT MAY NOT DISPLAY PERFORM UP TO STANDARD BUT WHAT THE STANDARD SETTERS THEMSELVES OF THEIR SUMS CONSENSUS THAT. WE THINK ARE CURRENT VALIDATION SYSTEM IS ROBUST OR NOT IS IT WE WE WE TALK ABOUT RACE TO THE BOTTOM. IS IS IT IT WHAT WHAT'S THE LIMITATIONS ON SOMEONE STARTING THEIR OWN ACCREDITATION AGENCY THAT THAT THEN ALLOWS YOU KNOW SUB STANDARD COLLEGES TO BE ABLE TO EXISTENCE STILL BE QUITE A QUITE A CREDIT THAT'S THAT'S I GUESS AND HE DID WHAT IS. HOW HOW SOUNDS ARE CURRENT ACCREDITATION SYSTEM IN HIGHER EDUCATION MENTION TWO EXEMPTIONS TO A TWO WAYS IN WHICH -- WASCO ACCREDITATION IN PARTICULAR WAS USED IN CALIFORNIA STATE OVERSIGHT AND THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM I THINK THAT'S A REAL THAT'S A RECOGNITION -- THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS IN THE PAST LOOKED AT WATCHED ACCREDITATION AS AS MEANING SOMETHING OF HIGH QUALITY AM AND IT IS ONE OF THE ACCORDING AGENCIES THAT HAS SHOWN ITSELF WILLING TO BE -- TO SCRUTINIZE I'M COLLEGES AND CHANGES IN COLLEGES -- ME MORE DEEPLY THAN OTHERS -- BUT IT WILL IT WOULD WAKE Và AT VARIES WIDELY -- AND THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY SOME OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PROPOSALS. TO ALLOW AND CREDIT AGENCIES THAT ARE NOT FULLY IN COMPLIANCE WITH REQUIRED STANDARDS TO CONTINUE TO BE ACCREDITING AGENCIES I'M BECAUSE IT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THIS -- THIS RACE TO THE BOTTOM. YES PLEASE. THREE IS. IS ACCREDITING HIGHER EDUCATION AND CALIFORNIA CAN BE AFFECTED BY THIS AND WE EXPECT TO SEE. A DETERMINATION OF THE QUALITY OF HIGHER EDUCATION PARTICULARLY NOW BECAUSE OF LOWER ACCREDITING STANDARDS HERE IN STATE -- RIGHT AT THIS MOMENT WHAT WE HAVE OUR PROPOSALS -- PROPOSES THAT ARE BEING DISCUSSED -- WITH A SLATE OF STAKEHOLDERS IN WASHINGTON DC -- SO THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE BASICALLY DISCUSSION FOR FINAL RULES WELL -- LOOK LIKE IS UNCLEAR BUT I WOULD SAY ULTIMATELY YES THERE ARE REASONS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO BE CONCERNED I I TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- THE AC ICS SITUATION ON THAT THIS WAS AN ACCREDITING AGENCY THAT WAS OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL STANDARDS -- AND THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ENDED RECOGNITION OF IT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS AS RE RECOGNIZE THAT REVERSING THE OBAMA ERA DECISION I'M AND THERE WERE YOU KNOW DOZENS OF SCHOOLS THAT WERE BASED IN CALIFORNIA. THAT WERE ACCREDITED BY A CICS AND THAT WERE UNABLE TO EVEN FIND A NEW QUIRK ACCREDITING AGENCY THIS REALLY DEMONSTRATES -- HOW THAT ACCORDING AGENCY STANDARDS CAN CREATE A RACE TO THE BOTTOM AND HOW CALIFORNIANS ARE AFFECTED? THE CENTER PAN SENATOR ARCHULETA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MY CONCERN OF COURSE TO THE VICTIMS THE VICTIMS ALL THE SHIFTING AN ACCREDITATION OF BACK AND FORTH THE STUDENTS THEMSELVES. AND THE MAN AT THE UNDERSERVED STUDENTS THAT ARE WHO RELY IN THE PALE PROGRAM THE PELL GRANTS AND HOW DOES ALL THIS -- AFFECT THEM AND ARE THEY TAKEN OFF THE LIST PUT BACK ON THERE AGAIN SEEKING THE PELL GRANT THEY'RE GOING BACK AND INTO THE PROCESS AGAIN BECAUSE I SEE THIS IS IS THEY ARE THE VICTIMS. OF HOW ARE WE PROTECTING THEM. IN THE CASE OF A CLOSE SCHOOL IN PARTICULAR OR LIGHT. I'M. WHEN THE CASE OF A CLOSE SCHOOL ACTUALLY IN -- TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DID INSTITUTE SOME CHANGES THAT WOULD RESTORE PELL GRANT ELIGIBILITY STUDENTS TO SCHOOL THAT CLOSE BEFORE THEY WERE UNABLE -- TO BEFORE AND THEY WERE UNABLE TO COMPLETE THE SAME PROVISION DOES NOT EXIST FOR THE STATE CAL GRANT PROGRAM. THANK YOU VERY GOOD THANK YOU CENTER ARCHULETA MEMBERS ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT IS COCHRAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY. ALL RIGHT NEXT UP WE WILL HEAR ABOUT STUDENT COMPLAINTS AND BUREAU ENFORCEMENT. OF MICHAEL MERION IF YOU WERE HERE PLEASE COME ON UP. AND DEAN -- FILL. DEAN I FEEL LIKE I WAS HERE LAST NAME WRONG [inaudible] WELCOME GENTLEMEN [inaudible] HELLO. WE'RE GOOD TO GO THANK YOU. LISTENERS THANK YOU. FOR ALLOWING ME TO COME IN TODAY MY NAME IS DOCTOR MICHAEL MERION I'M THE BUREAU CHIEF FOR PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION -- FIRST I THINK IS IMPORTANT IN ORDER FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND ON THE BUREAU SHOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO FIRST UNDERSTAND ME. WELCOME AND SO IN REGARDS TO MY BACKGROUND -- I AM A PRODUCT OF THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM -- FIRST IN MY GENERATION TO GO TO COLLEGE SO FIRST COLLEGE GRADUATE CARS COLLEGE STUDENT. AND HAVE BEEN EDUCATED IN TARLY% EXCEPT FOR SHORT FORM IN UTAH IN HERE. NOT ONLY HAVE I WORKED IN HIGHER EDUCATION AND WE CATION FOR NEARLY TWENTY PLUS YEARS WORKING IN VARIOUS SECTORS -- PRIVATE EDUCATION ON A TWO YEAR AND FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS AND MY EXPERIENCE RANGES. THIS IS MY FIRST STATE IN GOVERNMENT PER SE -- PRIOR TO THIS I WAS ASSOCIATE VICE PROVOST AT DREXEL UNIVERSITY HERE IN SACRAMENTO RUNNING THAT CAMPUS -- BUT FOR ME IN THIS ROLE -- AS THE BUREAU CHIEF I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO ALSO KNOW KIND OF THE MISSION AND FOCUS OF THE BUREAU. THE BUREAU PROTECTS STUDENTS IN CONSUMERS TO THE OVERSIGHT OF CALIFORNIA PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION INDUSTRY BY CONDUCTING QUALITATIVE REVIEWS OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS IN OPERATION THE STANDARDS FOR ACTIVELY. COMBATING UNLICENSED ACTIVITY IMPARTIALLY RESOLVING STUDENT AND CONSUMER COMPLAINTS AND CONDUCTING OUTREACH. THE VISION OF THE BUREAU'S TO BECOME THE NATIONAL LEADER REGARDING PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION AND MAXIMIZING CALIFORNIA'S CONFIDENCE IN INSTITUTIONS APPROVED BY THE BUREAU PROVIDE EQUALITY IN EDUCATION. OUR VALUES ARE ACCOUNTABILITY CONSUMER PROTECTION EFFECTIVENESS QUALITY INTEGRITY TRANSPARENCY INCONSISTENCY. WHEN I CAME INTO THIS ROLE JUST OVER A YEAR AGO? MY FOCUS WAS NOT ONLY TO BE ABLE TO HOLD THE OF OF MOST CONSUMER PROTECTIVE BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE BUREAU WAS IN A PLACE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT. IN COMING INTO THIS I CAME INTO A PLACE WHERE MORE I WAS A LITTLE BIT LOW. STAFFING WAS IN A QUOTE AT THE ADEQUATE LEVEL TRAINING WASN'T HAPPENING AS MUCH AS IT SHOULD BE. R. T. SYSTEM WAS UNKNOWN AT THAT POINT WE HAD A MOVE THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT AND WE HAVE TO START PREPARING FOR TWENTY TWENTY SUNSET HEARING. IN ADDITION TO WHAT YOU'LL BE HEARING A LITTLE BIT OF IN CARS THAT NEXT -- TESTIMONY. I CAN SAY IN MY TIME THAT WE'VE BEEN THERE. MORALE IS RAISED STAFFING IS WHEN A TRAINING HAS ALMOST DOUBLED I. T. SYSTEM HAS A SET DATE FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE A MOVE IS GOING TO BE TAKING PLACE THIS FALL. AND WE'RE ALREADY IN PREPARATIONS FOR OUR TWENTY TWENTY HEARING. FOR ME AS A BUREAU CHIEF IS NOT MY TIME IN IN OR INTEREST TO WASTE TIME IN MY POSITION HERE MY FOCUS IS STUDENT PROTECTION IN CONSUMER PROTECTION. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT TO MY BACKGROUND IN HIGHER EDUCATION FOR TWENTY PLUS YEARS. I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IS IMPORTANT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND BGP PORITES REGULATORY STRUCTURE FOR SCHOOLS THAT SERVE THE SERVANT NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS LIKE MY SISTER. STUDENTS THAT DO NOT PURSUE TRADITIONAL PUBLICAR EDUCATION PATHS OR STUDENTS THAT HAVE FOCUS PROFESSIONAL PATHS SUCH AS ATTENDING NURSING SCHOOL. OR BECOMING A REGISTERED NURSE. BBB IS THE GATEKEEPER FOR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION TO MEET THE MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS OF A HOME THE ACADEMIC STANDARDS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IT IS MY GOAL AND MY INTEREST AS A BUREAU CHIEF TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT IN EVEN STRENGTH IN THOSE RULES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING THE UP MOST CONSUMER PROTECTION. BPP AS DEBBIE SAID FROM -- TEACHES IS A PART OF A TRY AT OKAY. IN THAT TRY AT YOU HAD THE US DEPARTMENT OF THE ACCREDITING BODIES AND THEN YOU HAVE THE STATE PROTECTION. AS A BUREAU CHIEF WHAT WE DO IN THAT ROLE IS WHERE THE FIRST GATE KEEPER FOR THOSE INSTITUTIONS BECOMING -- A CREEK NOT ACCREDITED BUT BEING LICENSE WITHIN OUR STATE. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS B. B. HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DENY AN ORIGINAL LICENSE IF THE APPLICANT DOES NOT MEET THE MINIMUM APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS. SPECIFIC TO THE STATUE AND THE REGULATE REGULATIONS BABY IS AUTHORIZED TO DENY LACE LICENSES WHALE IN THE RENEWAL PROCESS. IT BB DENIES A LICENSEE OR RENEW WILL DESTITUTION MUST PROVIDE A SCHOOL CLOSURE PLAN BASED ON THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND OTHER FACTORS FACTORS. SECONDLY THE BUREAU IMPORTANT HAD IMPORTANT OVERSIGHT WHICH ISN'T TAKEN ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AS A RESULT OF STUDENT COMPLAINTS. BBB HAS SEVERAL TOOLS AVAILABLE TO ITS THE SPORE DISPOSAL WHEN IT COMES TO STUDENT COMPLAINTS THE FIRST ONE IS A NOTICE COMPLY WHICH IS SIMILAR TO A FIX IT TO GET YOU HAVE TO THIRTY DAYS TO RENEW WITH THAT. THE NEXT ONE IS A CITATION CITATION CAN BE ANYWHERE FROM ON THE NATURE OF THE CITATION. NEXIS OUR EMERGENCY DECISIONS. WHICH IS UNDER GOVERNMENT COLD EMERGENCY DECISION AS AUTHORITY -- TO IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT ALLOWS FOR THE BILL TO TAKE ACT ACTIVE IN QUICK -- STEPS WHEN IT COMES -- TO IMMINENT ISSUES AND INSTITUTIONS ARE IT IS IMMINENT YES ISSUES WITH ANY SENSE TO SPARK OCCASION. LASTLY WHAT WE ALSO HAVE IS SUSPENSION PROBATION AND THESE ALL FUND FALL UNDER OUR ACCUSATIONS WHICH ALSO ALLOWS US TO REVOKE THE LICENSE. THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS TOOLS THAT WE HAVE MORE DETAIL WOULD DO ONE ALLOW THE DIRECTOR TO SPEAK AND AT THIS TIME I WILL A PAST TO MAKE OF HIM. A DOCTOR MERION CHAIRS LEYVA GLAZER DEAN GRIFFEY LOW WITH THE DEPARTMENT -- THANKS FOR ALLOWING ME THE TIME TO BE HERE FOR THE AND SHARE THE DEPARTMENT'S EFFORTS TO SUPPORT. THE BUREAU AND PURSUE OUR ULTIMATE GOAL OF CONSUMER PROTECTION. ONE OF THE DEPARTMENTS IMPORTANT ROLES IS TO IDENTIFY CHALLENGES AT OUR PROGRAMS ARE BOARDS IN PARIS AND JUMP IN ACTION TO HELP. WHEN THEY'RE STRUGGLING? WHEN SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES ARISE THE DEPARTMENT POLLS PEOPLE OFF OUR DAY TO DAY TASKS? AND TO HELP THEM TOWARDS TURNING AROUND STRUGGLING FUNCTIONS. THIS IS ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF HAVING THESE BOARDS AND BUREAUS UNDER THE DCA UMBRELLA. WE CAN SWING TEMPORARY RESOURCES AND EXPERTISE TO PROGRAMS O GET THEM BACK ON TRACK. IN OCTOBER OF EIGHTEEN AN ARTICLE WAS WRITTEN ON BE PP GIVEN THE BUREAU AND HALF AN OVERSIGHT. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THERE WERE SOME UNFAIR CHARACTERIZATION THE ARTICLE IT HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED TO RESTRUCTURE. AND IMPROVE BPP IS ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS. IN NOVEMBER OF EIGHTEEN D. C. A. MET WITH PPP. THE DEPARTMENT'S DIVISION INVESTIGATION THE A BY. TO PUT INTO PLACE AN ACTUAL PLAN TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE AND ULTIMATELY ELIMINATE BBB'S COMPLAINTS BACKLOG. WE JOINTLY CREATED A BPP ENFORCEMENT TASK FORCE TO SIGNIFICANTLY ADDRESS THE BUREAU'S ENFORCEMENT CHALLENGES. DCA PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING RESOURCES TO THE TASK FORCE. ONE COMMANDER FROM DEAR BYE OUR STONE ARE SWORN LAW ENFORCEMENT ARM. THREE RETIRED ANNUITANTS FROM THE DAY OF OUR ONE SUPERVISING INVESTIGATOR FROM DFI. ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FROM THE OFFICE OF HUMAN RESOURCES TO ASSIST WITH THE BUREAU'S RESTRUCTURING. WHICH DOCTOR MARION WILL SPEAK. MUST BE TO MORE IN DEPTH AND IN A MOMENT. AND ADDITIONAL OFFICE SPACE AT DC HEADQUARTERS FOR BBB EMPLOYEES. THE CA VALUES ALL THE HARD WORK-THAT DOCTOR MARIAN AND HIS TEAM DOES ON A DAILY BASIS TO PROTECT STUDENTS. AND UP HELD CALIFORNIA'S PROMISE TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION. NOW DOCTOR MERION WILL SPEAK ON WE'LL SPEAK TO BE P. P.'S RECENT RESTRUCTURING AND THE TASK FORCE'S EFFORTS IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS. SO WHEN I FIRST CAME TO THE BUREAU JUST OVER A YEAR AGO I WAS VERY CLEAR AND SEEING SOME AREAS THAT THE BUREAU NEED TO IMPROVE ON AND ONE OF THOSE AREAS WAS SPECIFICALLY ENFORCEMENT WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT. BUT EVEN MORE SO I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR THE BOOK THE ARTICLE TO AN ENTIRE RESTRUCTURING AND REORGANIZATION AND WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT IN PROCESS CURRENTLY. BUT SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY TO AND AS DEAN ALLUDED TO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID WAS NOT ONLY BRING IN A TEAM TO HELP US THAT SPECIALIZED ENFORCEMENT BACKLOG. ARI FORSMAN IMP PARTICULARLY BUT WE ALSO PRIDE AND RETIRED ANNUITANTS TO HELP US WITH THAT. AND NOT ONLY A SENIOR -- ESPECIAL NOT A A SENIOR CAPTAIN AT THE DCA INDIA BY WE'VE ALL WHAT BROUGHT IN SOMEBODY FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAS EXPERTISE IN THIS SPACE. AND AS YOU WILL SEE IT OUT WHEN I REPORT LATER IN SOME OF MY NUMBERS YOU WILL SEE THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT STARTING IN OCTOBER YOU CAN SEE OUR ENFORCEMENT NUMBER START TO GO DOWN ONE OF MY GOALS THIS YEAR WAS OUR LAST YEAR WAS TO TRY TO GET OUR ENFORCEMENT NUMBERS DOWN TO A THOUSAND BACK IN REGARDS TO A BACKLOG AT THIS POINT IN TIME. WE ARE PRIOR TO BY THE DAY IN THE YEAR WHERE WE END UP FALLING IS A THOUSAND FIFTY SIX ANA WHICH IS DOWN. NOW ONCE AGAIN THIS IS CONTINUE IN THIS IS PART OF OUR OWN LICENSE ACTIVITY WE PICK FORMED A NEW UNIT TO FOCUS ON PRIMARILY ON FORCE AND LICENSE ACTIVITY FOR STUDENTS. AND THIS THIS UNIT IS ALREADY A SELF HAS RAN THROUGH A HUNDRED COMPLAINTS WITHIN THAT TIME FRAME. IN ADDITION TO THAT IS IMPORTANT IN INDIA WHEN WE CAME TWO THOUSAND NINE OBVIOUSLY I WASN'T THERE BUT IT ALREADY HAD A BACK LOG OF EIGHT HUNDRED PLUS. STUDENT COMPLAINTS WHICH IS EXTREMELY PROBLEMATIC FOR ANYBODY THE MYSELF AND OUR TEAM AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE HAD THE HOW CONVERSATIONS WITH THIS NEW TASK FORCE WAS. BEING ABLE TO CREATE A SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS US TO BE ABLE TO HAVE PROCESSING TIME. A LOT OF THE OTHER BUREAUS AND BOARDS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER HAS FAIRS HAVE I PROCESS TIME MEETING THAT THAT'S EITHER A HUNDRED ANDTWENTY DAYS TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY OR NINETY TWO HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS WHICH ALLOWS THE BUREAU ABOARD TO PROCESS. WHEN A COMPLAINT COMES INTO THE BUREAU IT IS LOGGED AS A BACKLOG THAT DAY? FOR THE BUREAU HAS NO TIME TO PROCESS NOW THIS IS ONE OF THE THNGS THAT I LEARNED WHEN I FIRST CAME TO THE BUREAU AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE THE TASK FORCE IN REGARDS TO BEING ABLE TO CREATING THIS PRE OF CREATE THIS -- TASK FROM PROCESSING TIME FOR US TO BE ABLE TO FUNCTION IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS US TO GET TO THESE COMPLAINTS IN A TIMELY MANNER. AND SO BY DOING THAT WHAT WE'VE ALSO FOCUS ON IS THE INTAKE PROCESS NOW WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN A COMPLAINT COMES IN WE CAN HAVE SOMEBODY WE HAVE A A STE WE HAVE STAFF MEMBERS TO TAKE THAT COMPLAIN IN PLAY REVIEW THAT COMPLAINT. BUT THE PROCESS WASN'T AS CLEAN AS I IT LIKED IT AND SO RIGHT NOW WORKING WITH THE TASK FORCE WERE ACTUALLY REVAMPING THAT PROCESS TO GET A CLEANER PROCESS. BECAUSE SOMETIMES WHEN THESE COMPLAINTS COME IN THEY ARE ACTUALLY MAY NOT EVEN NEED TO COME TO THE BUREAU THEY MAY NEED TO GO TO ANOTHER BUREAU BOARD. AND SO I'M VERY HAPPY TO SAY THAT WE'RE WORKING WILK WITH GETTING THAT DONE. SOME OTHER THINGS THAT THE TASK FORCE IS TAKING ON IS FOCUSING ON COMPLAINTS IT'S ON THE ONES THAT ARE WITHIN WHILE THE TASK FORCE TO FOCUS ON THOSE ONES THAT ARE AFTER THE FACT. NOT ONLY THAT ANOTHER PART OF WHAT THEY'RE FOCUSING ON IS OUR PROCESS THESE WITHIN THE BUREAU I FELT LIKE SOME OF THE PROCESS THAT WE HAD IN PLACE WORDS TO SYNC. AND THEIR WITH THEIR EXPERTISE IN ENFORCEMENT IN BACKGROUND THEY'RE COMING IN AND LOOKING AT THIS AND GIVE US A LOT OF CREATIVE IDEAS THE FOCUS ON BEING ABLE TO TIGHTEN UP THINGS WITH ON THAT FOR A FORSMAN SIDE -- ANOTHER THING THAT I ALSOWANT TO MAKE SURE BRING ATTENTION. TO IS -- TO TO TO TO NOT ONLY THAT BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THE NUMBERS THAT I WAS TALKING TO YOU EARLY. EARLIER MY GOAL WAS TO GET IT TO UNDER A THOUSAND BY DECEMBER THE END OF THE YEAR AND WE GOT ENDED UP IN THE THOUSAND FIFTY SIX WITH BRINGING ON THE TASK FORCE AND ALSO CREATING THAN ON LICENSE ACTIVITY UNIT. OUR OUR BACKLOG PER SE RIGHT NOW IS AT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX NOW THEIR NUMBERS HAVEN'T BEEN THAT LOW SINCE THE READ CREATION OF THE BUREAU IN TWO THOUSAND NINE WHEN HE CAME BACK. AND SO THOSE ARE EX SICKENING SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THIS THIS -- COMMITTEE TO UNDERSTAND AND SEE THAT WE HAD A HUGE TURNAROUND IN FIVE MONTHS OF MY TIME IN THIS POSITION FROM GOING FROM A A LEVIN OR ONE FIFTY EIGHT TO SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX OTHER AREAS THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT TO BE AND WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF ENFORCEMENT. WE ALSO BRING IN AND SPECIAL INVESTIGATOR SO THAT WAS PART OF THIS REAL WORK THAT WE'RE DOING WITHIN THE BUREAU SO WE'RE BRINGING IN INDIVIDUALS THAT FOCUS AND THESE ARE ACTUALLY NEW POSITIONS THAT I WILL BE HIRING FOR AN ACTUAL IN THE PROCESS OF HIRING RIGHT NOW. SOMEBODY THAT COMES IN THE HAS A SPECIFIC INTEREST AND BACKGROUND IN SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS AND THIS IS ANOTHER AREA I THINK THAT THAT THE BUREAU NEEDED SUPPORT. AND I THINK WE'RE DOING WELL AND I THINK WE'LL DO A LOT BETTER ONCE WE GET THESE INDIVIDUALS IN THIS POSITION SO NOT ONLY WE RESTRICTION THE ENFORCEMENT AS A WHOLE WE'RE ALSO RESTRICTION THE BUREAU AND SO WE'VE BEEN BUSY. OVER THESE LAST FEW MONTHS BUT I THINK YOU CAN SEE IT IN THE NUMBERS THAT WE ARE TAKING THE SERIOUS I'M TAKING THE SERIES AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR MERION. A MYSTICAL FEEL -- DID YOU WANT TO SAY THING ELSE YES BULLDOZER TESTIMONY MY TESTIMONIES AND EXCELLENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH HERE GLAZER DID YOU HAVE SOME QUESTIONS. OKAY VERY GOOD ANY QUESTIONS YES THIRD RAZA. THANK YOU -- AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK AND YOU MENTIONED -- CUTTING THE BACKLOG OF THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS. I'M INTERESTED IN. WHAT KIND OF COMPLAINTS THEY WERE? WHAT WAS THE BOTH BOTH THE QUALITY OF THEIR COMPLAINTS AS WELL AS THE QUALITY OF THE RESOLUTION -- BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF WAYS TO CUT THE BACKLOG WITHOUT REALLY ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM. AND SO IN THE IN ADDITION TO LOOKING AT THE NUMBER WHAT DOES THAT MEAN AS FAR AS THE QUALITY -- THAT WE EXPECT. FROM THESE INSTITUTIONS. HOW HAS ADDRESSING ALL THESE COMPLAINTS WHAT IS IT? CONCLUDED FOR YOU WHAT IS IT LEAD YOU TO THINK. WELL THERE'S A PATTERN HERE AND A CERTAIN KIND OF COMPLAINT. THERE'S A PATTERN IN WHICH WOULD LEAD US. TO MAKE THIS CHANGE OR RECOMMEND THIS CHANGE WHAT WHAT'S COME OF JUST. RIGHT HERE IN THE DECK HERE SO GREAT QUESTION I THINK FOR ME WHAT HAS COME FROM FROM THE FEEDBACK IN SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS I'VE HAD WITH THE TASK FORCE. IS THAT. WE NEED SPECIALIZED -- STAFF WITHIN THAT AREA TO FOCUS ON THE VARIETY OF COMPLAINTS TO COME IN THEY'RE VERY SIMPLE COMPLAINTS WHERE AS YOU KNOW I DIDN'T GET A BOOK THAT I WAS PROMISED. VERSUS YOU KNOW EVEN TO THE MOST RECENT STUFF WITH -- BRIGHT WOULD -- AROUND YOU KNOW NOT GETTING XIN CHECK TO BE ABLE TO PAY MY BILL SO IT VARIES WHEN THOSE COMPLAINTS COMING THERE SO THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS THEY CAN GO. ON EVEN TO FRAUD AND SO FOR ME ONCE AGAIN IT'S ABOUT GETTING A STAFF IN THERE THAT'S QUALIFIED TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THAT Y. LANES OF BEING ABLE TO SEE WHAT TYPE OF KEL PLACES ARE AND DEAL WITH THEM IN A TIMELY MANNER SO THE I WAS. SAFE STAFFING IS PROBABLY IN THE RIGHT STAFFING IS PROBABLY THE MOST CRITICAL THING FOR ME THAT I'VE NOTICED S WE STARTED TO GO THROUGH THESE THINGS. ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO ANY OTHER QUESTIONS [inaudible] GLAZER -- WELL THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY -- JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON SENATOR RISES POINT -- IN THE MATERIAL THAT YOU PROVIDED TO US THERE IS REALLY NO BREAKDOWN IN THE SUBJECT AREAS IN WHICH THE COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN. SUBMITTED YOU HAVE NUMBERS BUT YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE THE SUBSTANCE OF IT WHY IS THAT. OUT WE ACTUALLY DO HAVE THOSE NUMBERS WE'VE REPORT EVERY MONTH OR EVERY QUARTER AT OUR ADVISORY MEETING. AND SO WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION I CAN EASILY PROVIDED TO YOU BUT I BY TALKING ABOUT THE NUMBERS I'M TALKING ABOUT THE CATEGORIES IN WHICH COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN FILED.% RIGHT THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING WE HAVE A WE HAVE A TOP FIVE THAT-PROVIDES THAT INFORMATION THAT WE CAN EASILY GET THE INFORMATION OVER TO YOU I DON'T KNOW THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS REQUESTED THAT'S FOR EASIER ENOUGH. AND DO YOU HAVE A BROKEN DOWN BY SCHOOLS IN WHICH THE COMPLAINTS ARE TOO NO. WE DON'T HAVE THAT -- AND WHY IS THAT WOULD THAT ARMED OCCASION OF A PROBLEM IF YOU GOT IT. A LARGER THAN. NORMAL COMPLAINTS FROM ONE PARTICULAR SCHOOL NOW THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T PUBLICIZE BECAUSE THE ONGOING INVESTIGATION COULD JEOPARDIZE THAT SO WE DON'T WE WOULDN'T PUBLISH THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION. I SEE WHAT'S HARD FOR US TO KINDA DO EXIT YOU KNOW YOU YOU DO IN YOUR REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE YOU DO PROVIDE. SOME SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF AND FOR THAT YOU'RE. IN SILICON VALLEY UNIVERSITY SOUTH BAY LOW UNIVERSITY GAVE TWO CASES THERE -- SO THAT'S HELPFUL BUT THIS -- WHAT TRYING TO GET THE BIG PICTURE HERE AT IT DOESN'T MAKE IT EASY TO DO THAT -- HOW MANY -- LICENSES DO YOU TURN DOWN IN THE COURSE OF THE YEAR. HOW MANY LICENSES THAT WE TURNED DOWN I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER? FOR YOU BUT I CAN EASILY GET ON AVERAGE -- SO YOU SHOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF PENDING. APPLICATIONS FOR LICENSES. RIGHT YOU SHOW THAT. IN. TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN YOU ELEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR PENDING AN INVENTOR OF EIGHTEEN YOU HAD A HUNDRED FORTY TWO SO I GUESS I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THEN WHAT'S THE QUALITY ELEMENTS OF THOSE NUMBER REDUCTIONS IS BECAUSE HE SAID DEL. OUR YOU SAID YES QUICKER. SO AT FIRST OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW I WAS HERE IN. TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND SO WITHIN THE LAST YEAR THAT I'VE BEEN HERE WHAT I WAS ABLE TO DO WHICH I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT. COMING INTO THIS ROLE THEY DID NOT HAVE A CHIEF FOR ALMOST A YEAR AND A HALF IN OUR LICENSING UNIT AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I DID COMING INTO THIS ROLE IS GETTING SOMEBODY IN THERE TO HELP RUN THAT UNIT. AND I THINK PROBABLY WHAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED DURING THAT TIME IS THAT WE JUST TIGHTEN UP THINGS MOM THAT WOULD BE MY ASSUMPTION AT THIS POINT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO LOOK AT THE NUMBERS CLEARLY. BUT KNOWING THAT OUR STAFF KNOW OUR STAFFING LEVELS WERE DOWN WHEN I FIRST CAME TO THE BUREAU -- IN BEING ABLE TO UP THE STAFFING NO POTENTIALLY WHY YOU'VE SEEN SOME OF THE NUMBERS CHANGE. SO WE HEARD EARLIER TESTIMONY FROM -- MS -- COCHRAN SHEIDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF AREAS IN WHICH SHE THOUGHT THAT -- OUR OUR WORK WAS ENDANGERED BY FEDERAL ACTION -- ENDANGERED BY -- ISSUES OF ACCREDITATION -- ENDANGERED BY -- ONLINE. ENROLLMENT FOR OUT OF STATE COLLEGES -- AND ENDANGERED BY MISLEADING DATA PROVIDED BY A NUMBER OF PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS YOU SAT HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM IN AND LISTEN TO THAT. ARE THOSE THINGS THAT YOU'VE HEARD FOR THE FIRST TIME NO THESE ARE ACTUALLY HAVE HAD SOME CONVERSATION WITH THE CASE AND THEY'VE BEEN GREAT SUPPORTERS IN MYANMAR ROSE BUREAU CHIEF IN BEING ABLE TO HELP SOME OF THIS INFORMATION QUITE HONEST. AND SO NO IT WASN'T THE FIRST TIME I'VE HEARD IF YOU LOOK IN YOU KNOW SOME OF THE RULES FOR THE BRIDE THE BUREAU SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE SUCH THAT ALLOW -- I DON'T SEE ALLOW THAT POTENTIALLY LIMIT US SO TO SPEAK TO THE ONE TO THE ONLINE EDUCATION RIGHT -- WE ARE ABLE TO DO ENFORCEMENT BUT IT'S IT'S NOT INFORMED SO BASICALLY THE SCHOOLS OUT OF STATE ONLINE SCHOOLS ARE REQUIRED. TO REGISTER WITH US BE ACCREDITED AND PAIN IS TRUTH AND THAT'S THE LIMIT OF OUR ENFORCEMENT OF THOSE INSTITUTIONS. THOSE ARE THE THREE THINGS THAT WE HAVE. THAT WE ABIDE BY IT BUT THAT DOESN'T ALLOW WE DON'T WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO ANY ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT ON TOP OF THAT AND SO. IN SUPPORT OF WHAT YOU SAY AND I HAVE I I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT AND ACTUALLY SUPPORTED TO BE QUITE HONEST. THEY ARE TURNOUT SO THESE OUT OF STATE INSTITUTIONS -- PRESUMABLY OR MAYBE NOT SO THEY'RE THEY'RE REGISTERED OR LICENSED IN OTHER STATES. BUT THEY ALSO THEY'RE AT THEIR CREDIT IT IN LICENSE AND DO AND PAYING THE STRIP. FOR US TO BE ABLE TO TO WORK WITH THEM BUT WE HAVE NO OVERSIGHT INSOFAR AS GOING TO THE STATE IN BEING ABLE TO DO ANY ENFORCEMENT ON I GOT UP AND WE CAN DO. THANK YOU CAN BE AWARE OF ENFORCEMENTACTIONS THAT ARE BEING TAKEN IN THE STATE'S AGAINST THOSE INSTITUTIONS WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF THAT. YES BUT WE STILL WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE ACTION. I HATED IT AND I I LOVE IT BUT IT ALL DEPENDS ON HOW YOU DEFINE ACTION. AND BY TO FIND ACTION YOU MEAN YOUR ABILITY TO STEP IN WITH THOSE INSTITUTIONS AND AND FOR SOME SORT OF ACTIONS AGAINST THEM BUT ABSOLUTE BUT YOU'D ALSO BE IN A POSITION TO LET STUDENTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA NOW ABOUT ISSUES. THAT YOU BECAME AWARE OF ABOUT THOSE INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER STATES WE ARE LAWS VERY LIMITING IN THAT IS THAT STUDENT HARM HAS TO OCCUR. MEETING THAT SUCKS SO BRIGHT WOULD I THINK WAS THE MOST RECENT -- ONE THE BRIGHT WOULD WOULD -- WHO'S IN DECEMBER -- ON MY GOODNESS ARGOSY SORRY. ARGOSY SO MANY OF THE SCHOOL SO ARGOSY JUST OCCURRED RIGHT. IN SO WHAT HAPPENED WITH ARGOSY IS THAT. SOME SO THE STATE SO THE FEDERAL STATE TOOK STEPS IN REGARDS TO TURN IT CUTTING OFF THEIR TITLE FOR FUNDING. BUT AT THAT POINT TIME IT WAS NOTHING WITHIN THE BUREAU'S LAW THAT WILL ALLOW THE BUREAU TO TAKE ACTION. BECAUSE WE IT WASN'T ANY. INTIMATE STUDENTS ARE. IT WASN'T ANY STUDENT HEART WE HAD A AFTER THE HOME OR HAPPEN FOR US TO REACT TO THE STUDENTS. THAT'S THE LIMITATION OF OUR LAW. THAT MAKES SENSE AT THE CALIFORNIA LAW THAT'S A CALIFORNIA LAW I THINK THERE SHOULD BE CHANGES IN THAT CALIFORNIA LAW. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE LOOKING AT THE BILL SO ALL THE BUREAUS LAWS A WHOLE I THINK THAT'S CRITICAL. AS I THINK I'D BE INTERESTED IN -- I WOULD GUESS THAT MY COLLEAGUES MIGHT BE AS WELL. OF ANY SPECIFIC PROPOSALS YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE THE CHANGE OUR LAWS TO BETTER PROTECT OUR STUDENTS RIGHT I WOULD I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO REALLY LOOK AT ALL THE LAWS WITHIN THE BUREAU NO QUESTION. WELL THAT I'LL MAKE THAT AS A PENDING REQUESTS AND FOR ME AT LEAST IS THAT WOULD BE INTERESTED IN. YOUR EXPERTISE AND INSIGHT AS TO WAYS WE COULD CHANGE OUR LAWS TO BETTER PROTECT STUDENTS IN REGARD TO OUT OF STATE. ONLINE COLLEGES. BOB I'M EXCITED ABOUT THAT OKAY VERY GOOD YOU ALSO RAISE THIS ISSUE OF WELL THE THE ISSUE OF ACCREDITATION HAS COME UP AND YOU SAID YOU FOLLOW THAT AS WELL. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU THINK YOU SHOULD BE DOING OR WE SHOULD BE DOING COLLECTIVELY ON THAT ISSUE OR YOU HAVE DONE ON THAT ISSUE GREAT QUESTION SO ONE OF THE THINGS FOR ME THAT I HAVE AN INTEREST IN DOING IN TRYING TO DO IS STRENGTHENING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN. THE TRIAD AND SO THAT'S BETWEEN THE CREDITORS AND THE U. S. D. O. E. WE ALL KINDA WORK SEPARATELY BUT IF ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE DONE IN MY TIME IS TRYING TO STRENGTHEN THAT RELATIONSHIP. I THINK YOU CAN CERTAINLY GET BETTER -- AND I'M WORKING TOWARDS IT SEEMS THAT IF YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT ACTIONS THAT ARE BEING TAKEN BY THE ADMINISTRATION IN THIS AREA WOULD IT BE FAIR TO SAY YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROPOSED ACTIONS BY THE ADMINISTRATION. I'M SORRY THEIR ACCREDITATION ARE YOU CONCERNED. ABOUT THE ACTIONS BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION REGARD TO CHANGING THE PRACTICE OF ACCREDITATION -- ABSOLUTELY I'M ALMOST STUDENT CENTERED ADMINISTRATOR I'M ALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT ANYTHING THAT MAY COME IN THE PLACE THAT AFFECT OUR STUDENTS ARE CONSUMERS OF OUR CALIFORNIA ABSOLUTELY THE HAS THE BUREAU TAKING ANY ACTIONS TO INITIATE ANY COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES ABOUT. WHY YOU THINK THEIR ACTIONS WOULD DIMINISH THE QUALITY OF DEGREES FOR OUR STUDENTS NO I DON'T I DON'T THINK THAT'S OUR POSITION TO BE ABLE TO TO MOVE FORWARD BUT I CAN I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT MY INTERCESSOR A BUREAU CHIEF IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING THE? BEST THAT WE CAN WITHIN THE POWERS THAT WE HAVE OKAY AND I KNOW YOU DO WORK IN A BUREAUCRACY IN YOUR NEW. I'LL TELL YOU IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE YOU TO HEAR THAT I THINK I'VE SEEN OUR CURRENT ADMINISTRATION WEIGH IN ON A VARIETY OF THINGS IN REGARD TO THE LIMóN SITUATION -- THAT THEY THINK HE IS SUCH COMING UP SHORT. I WULD ENCOURAGE YOU AND YOUR OTHERS OTHERS WITHIN. THE THE GOVERNMENT TO WELL WORK TOGETHER TO TO CALL. ATTENTION TO THESE. ABSOLUTELY THIS THE MANAGEMENT -- AND AND WHAT ABOUT IN THE ISSUE OF THE OUTCOMES FALSE OUTCOMES -- SAID MISLEADING AND DECEPTIVE RECRUITMENT THIS IS AGAIN WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS RAISED EARLIER YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THAT ABSOLUTELY SO MADE TO ME THIS IS SICKENING TO BE QUITE HONEST -- I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR THE FORMER GOVERNOR TO BE ON CALIFORNIA'S TO NAY COMMISSION SO I WAS ABLE TO SEE A LOT OF HOW THE STUDENTS ARE AFFECTED THE I. T. T. IS AN ILL SOME OF THESE. IN SIENA SO FOR ME ABSOLUTELY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO PROTECT OUR STUDENTS ON IN OUR CONSUMERS BUT ALSO MAKING SURE ON OUR PART. THAT OUR LAWS ARE SUCH THAT ALLOW US TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE LICENSING INSTITUTIONS THAT ALLOW THAT ARE BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE THE OUTCOMES THAT WE NEED FOR OUR STUDENTS AND SO SOME OF THE DATA THAT'S CALLED ARE SOME OF THE DATA THAT'S GIVEN TO THE BUREAU IS SELF. PURPORTED DATA. YOU KNOW IT'S NOTHING WE NONE OF OUR LAWS ALLOW FORCES SAY THAT IT NEEDS TO BE AUDITED OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. AND SO FOR US ALL WE CAN DO IS ACCEPT THE INFORMATION THAT'S BEEN REPORTED TO US. SO I I GUESS WHAT I'D LIKE TO ASK IS MY FINAL THOUGHT WOULD BE THAT IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THE IF THE BUREAU AND DCA COULD COME BACK TO US WITH SPECIFIC LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS. TO ADDRESS A NUMBER OF THESE SHORTCOMINGS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. PREVIOUS TESTIMONY AND MAYBE IN SUBSEQUENT TESTIMONY -- ALL WITH THE IDEA THAT WE'RE HERE IN THE SAME DIRECTION HERE WE WANT TO PROTECT OUR STUDENTS WHO WANT THEM TO ACHIEVE -- THEIR BEST GOALS A AND A WAY THAT -- IS FAIR APPROPRIATE AFFORDABLE AND ALL THE REST BUT I THINK WHAT -- I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT. WE NEED THE BUREAU TO BE DOT JUST DAY IN ENFORCER OF SOMEONE WHO'S MADE A MISTAKE AND WE FIND OUT ABOUT IT AFTER THE FACT THEY'RE CERTAINLY VERY IMPORTANT ROLE THAT YOU PLAY IN THAT. BUT WE WANT TO BE PRO ACTIVE IN IDENTIFYING THESE ISSUES I HAD A TIME AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE LAWS. AND THE REGULATIONS TO ALLOW YOU TO DO YOUR JOB. BEFORE THE HARM HAPPENS AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE I THINK THAT WE HAVE MUTUAL INTERESTS AND WE WE APPRECIATE YOUR CONTINUED LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA AKA COME OF THE HOPE YOU I WOULD. THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER CENTER PAN. THANKS THANKS VERY MUCH A TO A CLEAR FIGHT. SO THE CURRENT LAW AND WE'RE TALKING YEAH WE WITH A CONVERSATION I SHARE US OUR GLAZERS DESIRE FOR FOR FOR GUIDANCE FROM THE BUREAU IN TERMS OF A LOSS TO MAKE YOU MORE EFFECTIVE BUT IS IT CURRENT LAW REQUIRES THAT HARM HAS. THROUGH KERR DOES THAT. CAN OCCUR TO ANY STUDENT ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY BECAUSE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THESE ONLINE ORGANIZATIONS THEIR OPERATE MULTIPLE STATES OR DOES THAT ACTUALLY HAVE. TO THE ARMY HAS HAPPENED ON ONLINE. ON GROUND ON GROUND STUDENTS. OKAY BECAUSE WE WE DON'T HAVE LAWS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO TAKE ACTION ON ONLINE OKAY SO OKAY BUT A POLITICALLY BUT THAT NUMBER TO DOES IT HAVE TO SO YOU HAVE A MULTI STATE OPERATOR AND THERE'S HARM TO HAPPEN TO A STUDENT AT OTHER STATE. ARE YOU ALLOWED TO ACT BASED ON THAT OR DO YOU HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL HARM HAPPENS TO LOOK STUDENT CALLOW AND WHEN IT COMES TO ONCE AGAIN WHEN IT COMES TO CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WE CAN WORK WITH THE BUT INCOMES TO OUT OF STATE INSTITUTIONS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR US. TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ACTIONS ON HOW TO STAY OFTEN AS WITH THE REGULATORY ISN'T AGENTS IN THOSE STATES. BUT IT HAS A BY THE CALIFORNIA -- SO AND ARE YOU TELL ME DARK MULTI STATE OPERATORS OR YES A LOT OF THE THINGS OF THAT OUT SO RIGHT SO THERE'S A MULTI STATE OPERATOR DOES HARM YOU DOWN IF I HAPPENED TO SEE LET'S SAY IN COLORADO OR ANOTHER STRIKE RIGHT. CAN YOU ACT TO THEN ARE A WE HAVE TO WAIT TILL HARM ACTUALLY EPISODE CALIFORNIA STUDENT WE ACTUALLY CAN'T WE CAN'T IF IT'S OUT OF STATE STUDENT WE CAN'T WE ENGAGED THAT ABOUT AS A MULTI STATE OPERATORS NOSE OPERATES IN CALIFORNIA IN ANOTHER STATE THAT THE HARM HAPPENED TO A STUDENT. IN ANOTHER STATE. FIRST CAN YOU THEN ACT OR DO YOU HAVE TO WAIT TO THE HARM HAPPENS FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENT. IF I I THINK I UNDERSTAND IF I UNDERSTAND YOU CLEARLY RIGHT. IF IT'S A CALIFORNIA STUDENT. IT IS A NOT A CALIFORNIA STATE IF THERE IS NOT A CALIFORNIA TO THE NOW BECAUSE IT'S NOT A EVEN SO EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW THEIR QUEUE COMMITTING HARD TO THE WORDS THEY'RE COMMITTEE ACTIONS THAT LED TO A HARM TO A STUDENT IN ANOTHER STATE. THAT'S ALL THE STATE OPERATED A OPERATE CALIFORNIA YOU STILL CAN'T DO ANYTHING THA'S WHEN WE WOULD CONTACT THE REGULATORY BODY IN THAT STATE. OKAY BUT OKAY LET ME ASK YOU KNOW. OKAY BECAUSE MAYBE DOCTOR PANAMA HE WOULD KNOW BETTER AND% SPECIFIC TO LIKE A MEDICAL LICENSE WELL I'M OF I'M SAYING IS THAT SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THERE'S A HARM THAT HAPPENED RIGHT THE THAT THIS INSTITUTIONS A MULTI STATE INSTITUTION RIGHT. IT HAS CERTAIN POLICIES IT DOES CERTAIN THINGS RIGHT AND IT DOES IT ACROSS THE INSTITUTION IS THE INSTITUTIONAL POLICY. AND IT LED TO HARM TO THE STUDENT IN THAT. UNIVERSE AND THAT COLLEGE BUT IN ANOTHER STATE IN ORDER TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE HARM ACTUALLY HAS TO HAPPEN TO A CALIFORNIA'S NORTH THIS POLICY CAUSE HARM. BUT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN TO A CALIFORNIA STUDENT YET IT ACTS ON THAT. UNIVERSITY TO SAY YOU NEED TO CHANGE THE WAY YOU DO THINGS ARE AT CETERA OR DO YOU HAVE TO WAIT TILL THIS HARM TO A CALIFORNIA SO GOOD FOR THE SAME REASONS. ARE AS I UNDERSTAND UNFORTUNATELY DEPARTMENT THE DEPARTMENTS REACH IS CONFINED TO THE START CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW YES OKAY RIGHT RIGHT USE OF THIS STUDENT REGARDLESS OF THE INSTITUTION. BEING A MULTI STATE INSTANCE STARTS YOU CAN'T ACT RIGHT AS AS MENTALLY I JUST Y. CLARIFIES THAT YOU CANNOT ACT EVEN WHEN YOU KNOW HARM IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN AND HARM HAS HAPPENED. BUT IT HAPPENED TO HAVE THE KERR OUT OF STATE FIRST. OKAY. THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN DOCTOR ARE EXCUSE ME -- CENTER ARCHULETA ONE SECOND SO YOU WOULD NOT EVEN WARNED THE STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. I WANNA MAKE SURE I'M CLEAR ON THAT. YOU YOU CANNOT ACT I'M FOLLOWING UP ON DR PANTS QUESTION YOU CANNOT ACT WE UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE A HARM DID NOT HAPPEN TO THE STUDENT IN CALIFORNIA BUT WE KNOW MAYBE IN THE TWENTY OTHER STATES THAT THEY'RE OPERATING THERE'S A PROBLEM. CAN YOU WORE IN THE STUDENT IN CALIFORNIA HEY THIS COULD HAPPEN TO YOU IT DOESN'T ALLOW BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS IF I'M A A BUSINESS OR CORPORATION. BASICALLY WHAT WE COULD BE DOING IS UNDERCUTTING THAT BUSINESS INCORPORATION ENACT AND IT'S NO HARM TO CALIFORNIA STUDENT YET AT A FOR US THAT FIRST BILL TAKE ACTION IT HAS TO BE HOME. SO WE WE HAVE SOME WORK TO DO. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH SAN ARCHULETA. THANK YOU CHIEF -- FOR BEING HERE -- MADAM CHAIR MY QUESTION. PERTAINS TO OUR VETERANS BECAUSE PRESENT -- OVERSEAS -- I WOULD SAY LAW ENFORCEMENT GENERAL ENFORCEMENT IN GENERAL MAKING SURE THE STUDENTS ARE PROTECTED -- AND SO ON IN THERE ARE TWO ISSUES THAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. ANY SCHOOL IS TRYING TO PROMOTE ITSELF OF FOR PROFIT GAIN WHETHER IT WOULD BE BUT THERE IS NO. ACTUAL JOB T THE OTHER END THAT'S NUMBER ONE AND THE AND THE CALVET THE VETERAN. WHO'S USING HIS -- GI BILL TO OBTAIN IS EDUCATION -- HOW ARE YOU WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT'S PROTECTED GOOD THAT FEDERAL STATE? AND THESE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT OUR YOUNG VETERANS. YOU GUYS ARE ALL BRING ENOUGH GREAT QUESTIONS BECAUSE THIS IS ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WE'RE LOOKING INTO BECAUSE REMEMBER. CAL VET IS A SEPARATE ORGANIZATION TO BE PP WHICH THEY OPERATE UNDER DIFFERENT LAWS AND WE OPERATE UNDER SO THEY MAY BE ABLE TO TAKE ACTION ON GI BILLS. THAT MAY NOT FALL WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THE BUREAU. AND SO THIS IS ANOTHER AREA THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT IN MY OPINION BECAUSE IT AS OBVIOUSLY WE WANT O BOTH TAKE ACTION AT THE SAME TIME BUT THE WAY THAT OUR LAWS ARE STRUCTURED DON'T ALLOW FOR US TO DO THAT. RIGHT IT'S SO WHAT WE TRY TO DO IS WORK TOGETHER -- WITH CAL DATING YOU I'M SURE YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT WHEN SCOTT COMES UP TO TALK ABOUT -- SAR BUT ONCE AGAIN THE WAY THAT OUR LAW WAS OR SUCH THEY MAY BE A TAKE ACTION BEFORE WE AT MAKE TAKE ACTION BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN GOING BACK TO THE STUDENT HARM PART. IT MAY NOT REACH THE LEVEL TO OUR LAW. BUT I WOULD THINK WE WOULD HAVE A FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY -- IF YOU HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE OF A PENDING PROBLEM THAT YOU HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO THE STUDENTS STATE A CALIFORNIA -- DID TO BE POINTED OUT AND THERE SHOULD BE A PROCESS AND PROCEDURE TO NOTIFY THE ENTITY EVEN THOUGH IT'S OUT OF STATE. OR WHEREVER IT MIGHT BE THAT SOMETHING IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN OR HAS HAPPENED AND IT MAY JUST AGAIN IT'S THE STUDENT WHO IS HURT TIME AND TIME AGAIN. PRESS ME GET FULL COMING FROM A COLLEGE CAMPUS WHERE I'VE WORKED THE MAJORITY OF MY LIFE. IN BEING ABLE TO NOT TAKE ACTION IN SEE THESE THINGS OCCUR IS ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS THAT I'VE HAD IN THIS ROLE. THE BE VERY CLEAR WITH THAT. BUT AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK. THANK YOU SENATOR ARCHULETA SO. WE CAN WORK ON SOME OF THE ISSUES YOU HAVE WITH NOT BEING ABLE TO DO SOMETHING BECAUSE IT'S AGAINST THE LAW BUT LET'S GO BACK TO WHAT YOU DO HAVE DIRECT CONTROL OVER -- HE SAID WHEN YOU FIRST TOOK OVER THAT THERE WERE SOME ENFORCEMENT CHALLENGES WHAT WERE THOSE CHALLENGES. I WOULD SAY THE FIRST THE FIRST THING WAS STAFFING. OKAY OKAY STAFF WHAT REGARDS WERE STAFFING LEVELS WERE LOW ALL IN IN THAT UNIT RIGHT AND THEN TRAINING -- WE WERE RECEIVING TRAINER BUT I THINK FOR ME THIS IS UP HAS TO BE A ONGOING THING TO BE QUITE HONEST. AND THEN THE THIRD THING IS GETTING PEOPLE IN THOSE POSITIONS THAT SPECIALIZE IN SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE A GAME CHANGER FOR THE BUREAU TO BE QUITE HONEST. IN BEING ABLE TO DO SOME OF THIS WORK THAT WE'RE DOING VERY GOOD SO WHAT IS YOUR AVERAGE TIME TO CLOSE A COMPLAINT. THAT'S THE NUMBER I'M GONNA HAVE TO LOOK UP FOR YOUNG BUT MY APOLOGIES. SO. DO YOU WHEN I COME IN AND I HAVE A CLAIM I HAVE A COMPLAINT IS THERE SOMEONE SPECIFIC THAT I TALKED TO HOW MANY OKAY AND HOW MANY INVESTIGATORS DO YOU HAVE RIGHT. SO YOU WOULD DEFINITELY TALK TO SOMEBODY ON WHEN YOU COME IN I THINK OUR INVESTIGATION NUMBERS ARE AROUND. THIRTEEN I THINK IS THE NUMBER RIGHT NOW. AND I CAN GET YOU ONCE AGAIN I CAN CONFIRM THOSE NUMBERS WERE. SO I COMMAND AND I REGISTER MY COMPLAINT. AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS NEXT SO YOU'LL GET A A LETTER BACK FROM US OR JUST SOMETHING CONFIRMING THAT WE HAD COMMUNICATION OKAY JUST SAYING HEY YOU'RE COMPLAIN IT'S BEEN RECEIVED. AND FROM THERE WE STARTED INVESTIGATING AND SO -- TYPICALLY BEGIN BE WHEN THOSE THINGS WHERE -- DEPENDING ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE COMPLAINT IT COULD BE ONE THOSE THINGS AS BONTA TOP PRIORITY -- BASED ON ARE STATUES OR CAN BE SOMETHING THAT JUST GOES TO THE TYPICAL PROCESS -- OF REVIEWING. AND DO YOUR OWN AGENTS OR WHAT WOULD YOU CALL THESE FOLKS INVESTIGATORS. DO THEY KNOW IS THIS IS THIS A PRIORITY FOR THEM -- ABSOLUTELY OKAY IT'S IT'S A PRIORITY FOR US BUT ONE OF THE THINGS IN THIS IS ANOTHER THING THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE IN SPEAKING TO ENFORCEMENT WE HAVE A HIGH TURNOVER RIGHT IN THAT ENFORCEMENT YOU'D. FIND THAT WE'RE TRYING TO CHANGE RIGHT BECAUSE I THINK I HEARD YOU SAY THAT THE THE LONGEST OR THE AVERAGE WAS THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE DAYS FOR COMPLAIN WHAT WAS THAT I DIDN'T I NEVER SAID THE AVERAGE US THAT WE ARE FOCUSING ON THAT TASK FORCE WERE. LOOKING AT CASES THAT WERE OF HOW MANY DO YOU HAVE THEIR ABOVE THREE AND SIXTY FIVE DAYS SO TOTAL WE HAVE GAVE YOU THE NUMBER IS. THOUSAND FIFTY SIX FORTY SIX OR SEVEN OKAY THAT WAS A SEVEN HUNDRED NUMBER SEVEN FORTY SIX I CAN'T TELL YOU BASED ON THE NUMBER THAT I HAVE HERE BUT THAT'S EASY ENOUGH REPORT WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION. IN THE REASON I'M ASKING ALL THIS TO BE MY OLD LIFE BEFORE I CAME HERE I WAS THE PRESIDENT MY UNION BEFORE THAT I WAS A UNION REPRESENTATIVE. SO WE DID SOMETHING CALLED GRIEVANCES WHICH IS VERY SIMILAR TO COMPLAINTS AND SO IT WAS MY JOB AS A UNION REP TO GET THOSE INVESTIGATED AND TURNED OVER AND GET A RESOLUTION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE MEMBER OR IN THIS CASE A STUDENT IS WAITING. SO NOW THEN WHEN I BECAME THE PRESIDENT OF MY UNIT WAS MY JOB TO MAKE SURE THAT MY UNION WRAPS WERE TURNING OVER AND GETTING THEIR GRIEVANCES RESOLVED SO DO YOU GET INVOLVED TO MAKE SURE. THAT THEY ARE INVESTIGATING AND TURNING THESE OVER AND GETTING SOME SORT OF SATISFACTION TO THE STUDENTS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE I THINK WITH THE QUESTION YOU'RE ASKING WAS ANSWERED IN REGARDS TO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO THIS BIG CHANGE RIGHT NOW WITH AN ENFORCEMENT AND THE BUREAU AS A WHOLE. BECAUSE I GOT INVOLVED. SO YES YOU DO ABSOLUTELY OKAY ABSOLUTELY AND WHEN YOUR INVESTIGATORS ARE INVESTIGATING IF THERE'S EVER ANYTHING THAT STANDS OUT SOMETIMES WHEN WE USED INVESTIGATE GRIEVANCES WE WOULD FIND THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING HAPPENING. THAT WE WEREN'T AWARE OF AND SO THEN IT WOULD CAUSE US TO DO OUR OWN INVESTIGATION SO DO YOU EVER HAVE A STUDENT COME TO MAKE A COMPLAINT THAT YOU FIND SO AGREED SHOWS. THAT YOU WOULD INVESTIGATE THE SCHOOL YES SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WILL BE DOING MOVING FORWARD WITH. IS PAYING A LITTLE BIT MORE ATTENTION TO FRAUD. A AND IN PARTICULAR VOUCHERS FRAUD SO YES ABSOLUTELY I WOULD SAY IS PAY PAY A LOT MORE ATTENTION TO FRAUD. I MEAN THESE POOR STUDENTS AS WITH MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE STATED THE YOU KNOW THIS IS THIS CAN RUIN THEIR LIFE IF THE SCHOOLS ARE DOING IT PROPERLY. QUESTION RECALL RIGHT YES DIDN'T MENTION THAT -- CURRENT LAWS DO ALLOW THE BUREAU -- TO GO ROUTE OF AN EMERGENCY ORDER IF IN FACT WE BELIEVE THE STUDENT IS IN IMMINENT. DANGER ARE OKAY VERY GOOD BUT YOU COULD DO IF A STATE AN OUT OF STATE SCHOOL THAT ALSO OPERATES IN CALIFORNIA. HAD BEEN SOMETHING FRAUDULENT HAD DONE SOMETHING TO STUDENTS IN ANOTHER STATE YOU COULD TAKE NO PROACTIVE ACTION ANOTHER STATE NOW SO YOU JUST SIT THERE GO GOSH I FEEL SO BAD FOR ALL THOSE STUDENTS OVER THERE THIS SCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA EVEN THOUGH I HAVE THIS INFORMATION. I CAN'TSHARE WITH THEM I I NEVER SIT THERE LIKE THAT -- ACTS OKAY GOOD. NEVER WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUT WHAT CAN WE DO FOR THE STUDENTS I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE FRUSTRATION UP HERE THAT YOU KNOW THE LAW WON'T LET US DO IT THE LAW WON'T LET US DO IT. WHAT CAN YOU DO RIGHT SO I THINK WHICH CHU I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT I'M CLEAR IS AN I DIDN'T TAKE THIS JOB TO SIT ON MY HANDS? OKAY AND I TO DESIGN A BIG ANY OF US TOOK OUR JOB FOR THAT REASON EITHER O FOR ME AND YOU CAN SEE IN THE LAST YEAR AND A-HALF EARLIER CHANGE THAT I'VE BEEN THERE THAT WE'RE MAKING A CHANGE. BUT THEY'RE ALSO THINGS AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT ARE LIMITING US IN BEING ABLE TO DO THAT AND WHICH IS WHY I'M HAPPY AND I BROUGHT IT HERE IN SO WE CAN MAKE SOME CHANGES. THANK YOU THE WELCOME CENTER GLAZER DID HAVE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS. WILL DR MIRANDA. I I GUESS Và MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE LAW THAT IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN YOURS AND I WANT TO CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THE THE THE STATUTE THAT CREATED THE OFFICE OF STUDENT ASSISTANCE AND RELIEF. AND IN THAT IT SAYS THAT THE DUTIES OF THAT OFFICER WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE DIRECTOR JUST A MOMENT SO I LOOK FOR TO THEIR INSIGHT BUT I'LL IT'S IMPORTANT I SHARE THIS WITH YOU THAT. PART OF THE DUTIES OF THAT OFFICE. OUR TO OUTREACH TO STUDENTS. CONCERNING INDUSTRY TRENDS AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. THAT'S PART OF THE DUTIES. OKAY IS TO SEE PROBLEMS AND LET STUDENTS BE AWARE OF THOSE PROBLEMS. SO I THINK THAT -- I THINK EVEN LOOKING WITH RESPONSIBILITIES THAT EXIST IN YOUR BUREAU AND WITH YOUR OFFICE YOU HAVE THAT ABILITY NOW IN MY OPINION. AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THAT SURE I TO BE MORE PROACTIVE IN THESE AREAS IT'S A PART OF THE CHARGE TO THAT OFFICE. AND I THINK IT'S A PART OF YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AND I THINK YOU WOULD SAW THAT IN THE STEPS THAT WE TOOK IN ARGOSY. AND HERE RECENTLY BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR WE HAVE TO BASED ON THE LAW THAT WE HAVE. IT APPEARS FROM OUR FROM OUR LEGAL INTERPRETATIONS TO ME IS THAT THEY'RE VERY LIMITING A STEP THAT WE TAKE BUT IN THE ARGOSY CASE WHAT WE DID DO IS WE DID SEND OUT. OUR SO OUR STAFF AND OUR BUREAU STAFF TO THESE INSTITUTIONS IN PROVIDED WITH AND PROVIDE INFORMATION BUT WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT WE DOING THAT WERE WALKING THE THIN LINE. AND FOR ME I DON'T WHAT I DON'T WANT TO DO IS PUT THE THE BUREAU IN JEOPARDY. BUT AT THE SAME TIME I'M A STUDENT CENTERED ADMINISTRATOR NOT BEEN THAT MY WHOLE LIFE AND SO BEST BELIEVE IF THERE'S WAYS AND ACTIONS I CAN TAKE. THAT CAN PROACTIVELY ALLOW ME TO DO THAT I WILL CERTAINLY DO ABSOLUTELY BUT IF YOU'RE AWARE OF THAT AND ANY BAD ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC SO WE'RE OF ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS IN THE STATE OF TEXAS. OR ARIZONA IT'S A PART OF THE PUBLIC RECORD MY FRIEND AND I THINK THAT TO TO PUT SOME LIMITATION ON YOUR ABILITY. TO SHARE ITEMS OF A PART OF THE PUBLIC RECORD WITH OUR STUDENTS OR PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS. I THINK IS IS SHORT CHANGING YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES BUT TAKE A LOOK AT IT WOULD ABSOLUTE THINK OF SUCH. THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER CENTER TO LETTER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CHIEF WHEN YOU YET STATED EARLIER WHEN YOU CAME ON ONE OF THE CHALLENGES YOU HAD. WAS THE NUMBER OF INVESTIGATORS YOU HAD AND AND YOU SHOULD THOSE ABOUT. THIRTEEN ARE YOU SEEKING TO GET ANOTHER FIVE SIX SEVEN AND THEN YOU ALSO MENTIONED SPECIALTY TRAINING. IS GOING TO TAKE AWHILE TO TRAIN THIS FIVE OR SEVEN OR WOULD YOU MOVE THE THIRTEEN INTO A DIFFERENT CATEGORY OR HANDFUL INTO A DIFFERENT CATEGORY AND TRAIN. AND TRAIN THE OTHER ONES COME IN AND HOW WOULD YOU HANDLE THAT RIGHT SO BASED ON SOME OF THE INPUT THAT WE GET FROM THE TASK FORCE THE GOAL WOULD BE ABLE TO ADJUST TO WHATEVER THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE. AND I WOULD DEFINITELY WANT TO KEEP THEM IN THERE AND JUST GET THEM TRAINED UP ABSOLUTELY. TO USE YOURS YOUR MORE SENIOR INVESTIGATORS TO FOR ADDITIONAL TRAINING AND THEN WHEN WE BRING IN THE ADDITIONAL SPECIAL INVESTIGATOR TO WIN. ONE HOPEFULLY THEY AND AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING RIGHT NOW TO RECRUIT -- FOR THESE INVESTIGATORS THAT YOU NEED JOBS ARE POSTED RIGHT NOW. AND THE OCEAN YES SIR AND WE ACTUALLY HAD A INNER WE HAD INTERVIEWS LAST WEEK AND WHAT IS YOUR BUDGET AND YOUR BUDGET AND ALL -- ANOTHER FIVE ANOTHER TEN WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR GREAT QUESTION WITH THE RESTRUCTURE I THINK WE WILL BE -- BUT I AM NOT OPPOSED TO GETTING ADDITIONAL STAFF BECAUSE I THINK YOU KNOW IT IT DEFINITELY WILL BE SOMETHING WE NEED TO LOOK AT AND FOLLOW UP WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD TAKE. FOR YOU TO FEEL PRETTY COMFORTABLE THAT YOU HAVE ENOUGH -- THEY THE NUMBER OF INVESTIGATORS SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO HANDLE THE WORKLOAD THAT'S A THAT'S A HARD UESTION ASKS ME TO ANSWER AT THIS POINT BECAUSE PART OF ME WANTS TO SEE HOW THE RE ORG LOOKS FIRST. AND THEN ONCE WE GET THESE TWO POSITIONS IN AN ADDITIONAL STAFF I THINK I'LL GET A BETTER HAVE A BETTER IDEA IN REGARDS TO BUILDING BEFORE I I THINK THAT ALSO NEED TO BE A TOP PRIORITY. BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO DO THE WE NEED TO KNOW THAT -- BECAUSE THE GORE AGAIN I KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE STUDENTS -- WHO THE -- UNDERSERVED THOSE VETERANS AND EVERYONE ELSE THAT ARE LOOKING FOR THAT FIRST JOB TO GET OUT OF SCHOOL START WORKING. AND IF THERE'S A ISSUES OUT THERE THAT WE SHOULD CONCERN OURSELVES THAT JUST WITH OUR STUDENTS BUT IF YOU HAVE THE ACCESS AND TODAY IN THE INTERNET TO JUST. SEND IN AN EMAIL -- OUT TO THE VARIOUS -- STUDENTS ABOUT OTHER SCHOOLS OTHER STATES AND YOU NEED TO BRING EVERYBODY TOGETHER AND SO -- AT LEAST FOR IDENTIFICATION OF A SCHOOL THAT HAS POOR HISTORY VERSES ONE THAT HAS GOOD HISTORY WHETHER BE IN OR OUT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA [inaudible] SURE. THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER ARCHULETA. GERMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME WE APPRECIATE IT I THINK WE GAVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF HOMEWORK TO COME BACK WITH SOME LEGISLATIVE IDEAS THAT WE COULD HELP MAKE YOUR JOB EASIER A BENEFIT THE STUDENTS OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME STAY WITH MISTER. GOT OVER IT OKAY VERY GOOD. SO WE'RE NOT GONNA TALK A LITTLE ABOUT SCHOOL CLOSURES AND IF STUDENTS ARE BEING WELL SERVED -- MISTER SCOTT THEY'LL VERDE PLEASE COME ON UP. YOU ARE THE OFFICE YOU'RE THE CHIEF OF THE OFFICE OF STUDENT ASSISTANCE AND RELIEF WELCOME. EACH. YES IT'S A LITTLE SQUEAKY IT'S NOT YOU. HERE I MATTER. GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY I'M I'M PROUD TO BE IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY TO TALK ABOUT -- THE OFFICES STUDENTS DISTANCE AND RELEASE EFFORTS AND IN GENERALLY TO BE THE FIRST -- CHIEF OF THE OF THIS PARTICULAR OFFICE -- LIKE DR MARIANNE I AND SLOWLY CREEPING UP ON ABOUT TWO ASIAN -- WORKING IN VARIOUS CAPACITIES IN VARIOUS SECTORS INCLUDING. ON TEN YEARS IN THE QUEUE COMMUNICABLE JUST CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE BEFORE I CAME OVER TO TAKE OVER AS THE CHIEF OF OCR. I'M AND I'M VERY STUDENT CENTRIC AS DOCTOR MERION MENTION AS WELL. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY DREW ME TO THIS POSITION WAS -- THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE STUDENT PROTECTION -- AND TO HELP STUDENTS IN A VERY DIRECT AND HOPEFULLY MEANINGFUL WAY -- SO TODAY I'M GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THREE AREAS -- THAT HOPEFULLY WILL HELP US SPEAK TO THE QUESTION THIS POST ON THE AGENDA ITEM TODAY. THE HISTORY OF SO OUR BRIEF AS IT IS -- BUT BUT EVENTFUL I THINK. HELLO SO ARE IN THE BUREAU DO PUT STUDENTS FIRST AND VALUE STUDENT PROTECTION IN ALL OF OUR EFFORTS. AND HOW WE ACTIVATE AND DEPLOY QUICKLY -- WHEN SCHOOLS UNFORTUNATELY CLOSE -- AN ONGOING TOPIC OF TODAY'S DISCUSSION. SO -- STARTING WITH THE HISTORY DURING THE BUREAU'S TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SUNSET REVIEW. VARIOUS CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE TERRACE PRACTICE ACT TO IMPROVE ITS EFFECTIVENESS AND STRENGTHEN ITS STUDENT SUPPORT CAPABILITIES. SENATE BILL -- ELEVEN NINETY TWO CREATED -- SAR. AND THE OFFICE OF STUDENT ASSISTANCE AND RELIEF BEGAN OPERATING ON JULY ONE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN UNDER MY LEADERSHIP -- SENATE BILL ELEVEN NINETY TWO ALSO CREATED THE STUDENT TUITION RECOVERY FUND SOMETHING THAT DEBBIE -- OUTLINE VERY. EARLY AND CORRECTLY. ALSO KNOWN AS STRYFE I'M SORRY PROBABLY BELIEVE USING ACRONYMS BOTH OF US ARE IN STRESS THROUGHOUT MY TESTIMONY. THAT MEANS. THE STRIP FUND ALLOW STUDENTS ENROLLED AT THE TIME OF SCHOOL CLOSURE OR WHO WERE ENROLLED IN ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS OF THE SCHOOL'S CLOSURE. TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR REIMBURSEMENT FOR ANY FUNDS THEY PAY THE SCHOOL -- THROUGH THE STRESS FUND. THOSE ARE SOME KEY HISTORICAL ITEMS -- OUR DUTIES ARE TO CONDUCT OUTREACH AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT -- TO PROVIDE INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE TO STUDENTS AFFECTED BY PIPE PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY INSTITUTIONS. UNLAWFUL ACTIVITIES OR ON IN THE WORST CASE SCENARIO CLOSURE. AND ALSO TO SERVE AS THE PRIMARY PER TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF POST SECONDARY STUDENTS BOTH CURRENT AND PROSPECTIVE PASSED STUDENTS. THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- WORKING IN CONSULTATION WITH OTHER STATE AND FEDERAL. AGENCIES SOME OF WHICH ARE CALLED OUT SPECIFICALLY IN THE ENABLING STATUTE SUCH AS CALVET WHICH HAS BEEN MENTIONED COMMUNITY COLLEGES DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND OTHER CELLS ARE ALL -- DIRECT PARTNERS. SO MOVING ON TO THAT STUDENT FIRST APPROACH -- STAR COUNSEL STUDENTS AS THEY NAVIGATE THEIR FINANCIAL AND ACADEMIC FUTURES. THOSE ARE ALSO PROVIDE SCHOOL CLOSURE ON PROVIDE SCHOOL CLOSURE SCHOOL CLOSURE SORRY WORKSHOPS -- WE ASSIST STUDENTS IN SEEKING A REFUND FROM THE SCHOOL IF THEY'RE ENTITLED TO THAT. WE ADVISE STUDENTS HOW TO REQUEST THAT THEIR STUDENT LOANS BE DISCHARGED THROUGH THE FEDERAL. LOAN JUST CHARGE PROGRAMS OF WHICH THERE ARE SEVERAL AND OFTEN DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE. WE GUIDE STUDENTS REQUESTING REIMBURSEMENT FOR ANY OUT OF POCKET PAYMENTS TO THE SCHOOL THROUGH THE STRESS. IN ITSELF CAN BE A LITTLE BIT COMPLICATED WE'VE HOPEFULLY WE'VE MADE THAT. EASIER TO UNDERSTAND THROUGH SOME EFFORTS -- SINCE OF SARS COME ONLINE. AND WE PROVIDE INFORMATION TO STUDENTS WHO ARE INTERESTING INTERESTED IN TRANSFERRING TO ANOTHER INSTITUTION. OR TO TAKE PART IN A TEACH OUT AGREEMENT IF THERE IS ONE IN PLACE WHEN THE SCHOOL CLOSES -- WE WORK WITH STATE AND PRIVATE ENTITIES. WE CONDUCT ENFORCEMENT RELATED RESEARCH PASSENGER GLAZER MENTIONED -- WE DEVELOP A SOCIAL MEDIA PER -- WHICH HAS BEEN A VERY KEY. COMPONENT OF SARS AFFECTED MISSING COMMUNICATING WITH STUDENTS -- WEB CONTENT AS WELL WE'VE GOT OUR OWN WEBSITE WITH A LOT OF INFORMATION FOR STUDENTS THAT WE ARE CONTINUALLY EVALUATING EXPANDING. ALL OF WHICH ARE THERE TO HELP EXPAND OUR ABILITY TO INFORM AND SERVE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS -- STAR HAS FAILED -- SO CLOSE SCHOOL EVENTS -- IN THE FORM BOTH OF IN PERSON WORKSHOPS ALSO A REMOTELY -- AS WELL THROUGH -- CONFERENCE CALLS -- EMAIL COMMUNICATION AND ONE ON ONE MEETINGS. AND ON ON THE HORIZON HOPEFULLY OUR IN OUR NEXT THING WE'RE LOOKING INTO IS THE BILL YOUR PRIDE OUT REACH REMOTELY -- THROUGH WEB IN OUR PLATFORM -- WE HAVE SUCCEEDED TO DATE AND GRANT AND HELPING THE BUREAU GRANT MORE THAN TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN FINANCIAL RELIEF. TO STUDENTS AFFECTED BY -- CLOSURES OR WHO OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE. FOR STRYFE REIMBURSEMENT. I WOULD SAY OUR BIGGEST JOB MOST IMPORTANT WORK -- WE DO A LOT OF THINGS -- BUTIS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS REACHING OUT TO STUDENTS AND WORKING WITH THEM -- WHEN SCHOOLS UNFORTUNATELY CLOSER OPERATION OFTEN AS YOU'LL HEAR A LEADER IN MY TESTIMONY WITH VERY SHORT NOTICE -- IT'S CERTAINLY ARE MOST RESOURCE INTENSIVE -- COMPONENTS IN ON IT IF NOT. THE MOST IMPORTANT -- IN STANDING UP THE PROGRAM IN AND OFFICE I'VE HIRED STAFF WHOSE DUTIES INCLUDE. FACILITATING CLOSE SCHOOL OUT REACH ADVANCE. DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING A STUDENT FOCUSED WEBSITE -- BUILDING AND MAINTAINING CLOSE WILL CONTENT FOR THAT WEBSITE WHICH IS EXPANDING GREATLY HAS EXPANDED GREATLY -- DEVELOPING AND UPDATING OUTREACH MATERIALS RECENTLY TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ON TO ADDRESS SOME OF SENATOR GLAZERS CONCERNS ABOUT HOW WE COMMUNICATE -- RED FLAGS ENFORCEMENT RELATED INFORMATION. UPDATING THE CLOSE SCHOOL PROCESS AND PACKET EVERYTHING THAT THE BUREAU DID PRIO SORRY AROUND CLOSE SCHOOLS HAS BEEN. RE EVALUATED REASSESS -- UPDATED -- WITH THAT WITH THE I. ON IMPROVEMENT FOR STUDENTS. I INCLUDING CREATING NEW PROCEDURES. A STAFF ALSO COORDINATES THE LOGISTICS OF THESE EVENTS OFTEN WITH VERY SHORT NOTICE -- TO TRY TO PUT ON THE BEST POSSIBLE SET OF INFORMATION WE CAN FOR STUDENTS INCLUDING. INVITING CAM -- THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT I'M SORRY THE STATE APPROVING AUTHORITY FOR VETERANS EDUCATION TO THE CAL THAT -- OFTEN THESE SCHOOLS HAVE ON VARIOUS FUNDING SOURCES LIKE FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID -- TITLE -- THIRTY EIGHT IN GI BILL -- WORKERS -- WORKERS COMP AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FUNDS AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO -- IF THOSE ARE IF IF SCHOOLS TO CLOSE HAVE FUNDING TO THOSE SOURCES WE COORDINATE WITH THOSE ENTITIES. TO TRY TO GET THEM ON SITE WITH US DURING THE WORKSHOPS AND IF NOT AT LEAST GET THEIR INFORMATION IN THE HANDS OF STUDENTS EFFECTIVELY. THROUGH OUR CLOSE SCHOOL OUR EACH EFFORTS WE'VE SUCCESSIVELY ADVANCED AND BEGAN SUBMITTED TO THE BUREAU FOR APPROVAL TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY STRYFE CLAIMS -- AND AGAIN IT TOTALS AT TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR NUMBER THAT I X. I QUOTED EARLIER. WE'VE WORKED TO IMPLEMENT A CASE MANAGEMENT STYLE APPROACH TO WORKING WITH THE STUDENTS AGAIN AYE AYE IN MY PERSONAL OPINION. A REALLY STRONG IMPROVEMENT OF THE OUTREACH EFFORTS POST OF STAR VERSES THE BUREAU'S PRIO SAR -- EFFORTS -- WERE WE REALLY EMPHASIZE CUSTOMER SERVICE -- AND PRIORITIES PRIORITIZE -- IDENTIFYING WHAT IS THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE REALLY UNDER THE BOTH THE CURRENT FEDERAL AND STATE STATUTES AND REGULATIONS. AGAIN BEING INFORMED OF EXACTLY WERE OUT WITH CLOSE SCHOOL DISCHARGES BARS DEFENSE TO REPAYMENT OTHER TYPES OF DISCHARGES. THE AWARD OF THIRD PARTY EDUCATIONAL CREDITS AS DEBBIE MENTIONED -- STRYFE -- AS AS THOSE RULES HAVE CHANGED AS WELL SO. WE REALLY TRY TO GET EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY CAN FOR THE STUDENT AND DO WHAT WE CAN FOR THE STUDENT. THIS APPROACH CREATES A CONNECTION WITH STUDENTS EARLY ON THE PROCESS HELPS BUILD A REPORT AND TRUSTS. AND GOES ALL THE WAY THROUGH WRAPAROUND SERVICES WHICH INCLUDES -- WORKING WITH A STUDENT POST CLOSURE OF AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'VE. FALLEN ON THE PHONE YEAH I'M TAKING THE RIGHT STEPS ON THEIR FEET -- TRANSFERRED IF THEIR INTENT WAS TO TRANSFER. GET THE FUNDS BACK IF THAT WAS THEIR INTENT -- WHATEVER IT IS. WE WORK WITH THEM IN THAT CASE MANAGEMENT APPROACH. OKAY THE NEXT ITEM THE LAST ITEM IS CLOSE SCHOOL -- WHEN I CALLED EARLIER ACTIVATION OR DEPLOYMENT? SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE SCHOOL POLLUTION CLOSURES THAT HAVE BOTH COME OUT THIS MORNING THIS AFTERNOON -- BRIGHT WOULD IN ARGOSY I FEEL LIKE THOSE ACTIVE IN OUR STUDENT OUTREACH APPROACH -- WHEN WE RECEIVE NOTICE OF BRIGHT WHICH CLOSURE UNFORTUNATELY ONLY FORTY EIGHT HOURS BEFORE THE ACTUAL -- CLOSURE ITSELF FOR THE LOCK THE DOORS IN DECEMBER -- SORRY MEDIALLY BEGAN WORKING ON CORD MEANS CLOSE SCHOOL EVENTS FOR THE STUDENTS AT ALL THE ELEVEN EFFECTIVE AFFECTED CAMPUSES THAT DEBBIE MENTIONED. BPP N. T. C. A. PROACTIVELY REACH OUT TO LEGISLATORS OFFICES TO PROVIDE THEM THE NOTICE OF THE IMPENDING CLOSURE. AND SHARE AVAILABLE RESOURCES FOR EFFECTIVE STUDENT AFFECTED STUDENTS IN THAT CASE WE'RE TALKING -- APPROXIMATELY TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED STUDENTS WHO ARE IMPACTED. WITHIN A WEEK OF THE CLOSURE WE HAD HELD ELEVEN IN PERSON CLOSE SCHOOL WORKSHOPS. AND HAVE AN HAD CONNECTED WITH SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY STUDENTS IN PERSON AND ON THOSE WORKSHOPS. AND TO DATE OF PROCESS TWO HUNDRED FORTY TO STRIP CLAIMS AS A RESULT. SINCE THEN WE ALSO CONDUCTED TO ADDITIONAL WORKSHOPS IN THE SAN DIEGO AREA. ONE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE SAN DIEGO COMMUNICANTS DISTRICT AND THEN ANOTHER STANDALONE WORKSHOP THAT WE DID S. AND THAT WAS THE HARDEST. AREA HERE WITH THE FOR WITH FOR CAMPUS CLOSURES -- IN THAT JUNE GEOGRAPHIC AREA. WITH ARGOSY MOVING ON TO ARGOSY SIMILARLY. BE SHORT SHORT TIME FRAME AGAIN BP RECEIVE NOTICE FROM THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ON FEBRUARY TWENTY SEVENTH. THAT ARGOSY WOULD NO LONGER HAVE ACCESS. TO BEFORE BP RECEIVE THAT OFFICIAL CLOSURE NOTICE -- SO I WAS ALREADY PROVIDING INFORMATION TO STUDENTS AT ARGOSY CAMPUSES DISSEMINATING INFORMATION. NOW KEEP IN MIND ONE THING THAT HAS NOT BEEN MENTIONED UP TO THIS POINT IS LAST YEAR -- OUR INSTITUTE HAD ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WERE CLOSING SEVERAL OF THEIR BRANCH CAMPUSES. SORRY I DON'T REMEMBER THE NUMBER OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD I BELIEVE IT WAS SEVEN CAMPUSES THAT THEY CLOSED LAST YEAR -- THAT WERE ON IN THAT ACTIVELY ENGAGED ON IT ONE OF WHICH WAS ACTIVELY STILL ENGAGED IN INTERNAL TEACH OUT. THE OTHERS HAD CLOSED -- BY DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST SO -- SAR HAD ALREADY WORKED WITH -- THEIR CORPORATE CONTACTS HAD GOTTEN STUDENT ROSTERS HAD MADE CONTACT WITH STUDENTS AND HAD CONDUCTED WORKSHOPS AS WELL SO WE ARE KIND OF HAD. UNLIKE BRIGHT WOULD SORT OF HAD A HAD A PRE EXISTING RELATIONSHIP IN THAT AREA -- SO AGAIN FOR THE NEW CAMPUS IS THAT WE'RE NOW GOING TO BE IMPACTED BY THE LOSS OF THEIR FINANCIAL AID WE IMMEDIATELY GOT OUT THERE AND START DISSEMINATING INFORMATION -- AS DOCTOR MERRY MENTION UNFORTUNATELY WE COULDN'T -- DEFINITIVELY SAY THIS THE FIFTH OFFICIAL DECISION THEY HAD MADE THAT BEEN MADE BY THE SCHOOL BUT AS OFTEN AS THIS CASE WHEN SCHOOLS LOSE THEIR FINANCIAL AID THAT CLOSURE IS. IMMINENT SO WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE STUDENTS AWARE OF US AWARE OF OUR SERVICES. AND AGAIN HELP BUILD THAT REPORT EARLIER -- THAT I MENTIONED. THEN ON MARCH FIRST BP ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE ENCOURAGING. AGAIN THIS IS SPEAKING TO THE PROACTIVE NATURE OF WHAT WE DO ENCOURAGING STUDENTS. TO CONNECT TO OBTAIN THEIR ACADEMIC AND FINANCIAL RECORDS. FROM THE INSTITUTION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. BY. ACCESSING THE STUDENT PORTAL GETTING THEIR RECORDS ON IT'S OFTEN AN ISSUE IN SCHOOLS CLOSE -- IN IN WITH SHORT TIME FRAME STUDENTS REALLY EITHER ACADEMIC AND FINANCIAL RECORDS FOR MANY REASONS. AND SO -- WE KIND OF SNIFF THAT OUT AS A POTENTIAL PROBLEM WITH THIS SCHOOL AND HAD HAD INFORMATION TO STUDENTS REALLY AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE -- ENCOURAGING THEM TO GET THOSE DIRECTOR AS DOCTOR MERION OTHERS MENTION MARCH FOURTHV. P. N. ISSUES THEY MERGING EMERGENCY DECISION. HALTING THE COLLECTION OF TUITION AND ANY NEW STUDENT ROLE MINUTE ARGOSY. SO THAT'S MARCH FOURTH BY MARCH THIRTEENTH SO IT'S NINE DAYS CALENDAR DAYS -- SARHAD BUT AT THAT POINT HAD ALREADY HELD CLOSE SCHOOL WORKSHOPS FOR ALL AFFECTED STUDENTS AT ALL THE CAMPUS IS THAT A CLOSED. AS WITH BRIGHT WORD -- WE'RE NOW IN THE PROCESS OF REASSESSING THE NEED TO CONDUCT MORE WORKSHOPS. AGAIN VERY SIMILARLY UNFORTUNATELY COINCIDENTLY APPROXIMATELY ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED STUDENTS AFFECTED BY THIS CLOSURE AS WELL -- SARS CONNECTED WITH APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED STUDENTS SINCE THIS LAST ROUND OF CLOSURES WITH ART INSTITUTE. AND PROCESSED ABOUT SIXTY STRIVE CLAIMS [inaudible] SORRY. VERY BRIEFLY IN CLOSING I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION ANOTHER COMPONENT OF THOSE ARE SERVICES THAT IS COME UP TODAY AS WELL. WHICH IS THAT WE ALSO ENGAGE IN PROACTIVE OUT REACH THROUGH PARTICIPATION IN EVENTS ORGANIZED OR SPONSORED BY -- STAR PARTNERS. EXAMPLES HERE WOULD BE TABLES AND PRESENTATIONS AT VARIOUS COLLEGE FAIRS. ARE CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERAN AFFAIRS IN THEIR CALIFORNIA TRANSITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. AND WITH THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGE ADMISSION COUNSELORS. AMONG OTHERS SO ONE OF THOSE ARE KEY OBJECTIVES IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IS NOT ONLY TO BUILD ON THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND TO DO MORE PROACTIVE OUT REACH. FOR MORE PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS BUT TO DO SO OUR SELF AS WELL TO CREATE ORGANIZE AND PROMOTE OUR OWN OUTREACH EVENTS. WE HELD ONE SUCH EVENT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND WE PLAN TO HOLD MORE IN. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN CLOSER STRIVES TO PROVIDE STUDENTS THE INFORMATION AND TOOLS TO MAKE INFORMED EDUCATED DECISIONS AND THEIR ACADEMIC FUTURES. AND TO ENSURE STUDENTS CAN SUCCEED FALLING BACK WITH MY ORIGINAL COMMENTS OF MY STRONG BELIEF AND STUDENT SUCCESS -- SEVERAL CONTINUE TO MAKE STUDENTS IT'S PRIORITY. AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR ME I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THERE ARE TWO ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE PROCEED. THE THE ABILITY TO TO PARTNER UP WITH WITH ALL THESE DIFFERENT ENTITIES IS SO VERY IMPORTANT AND AND SOUND LIKE IT'S A VITAL -- DO THE SCHOOLS KNOW THAT THAT YOU'RE THERE TO SERVE AND HELP -- IN THE PROCESS IF THE CLOSING IS EVIDENT -- IF THERE IS A I GUESS AN EVOLUTION OF OF NEGATIVE THAT'S PLACING THEY COULD REACH OUT FOR HELP -- RATHER THAN SHUT THE DOOR AND THAT CAUSES PROBLEMS. SHARE THAT WITH ME YEAH WE'RE DEFINITELY TRYING TO EXPAND THE SPOKE US A SCOPE OF OUR AWARENESS YOU KNOW -- AGAIN STILL BEING FAIR IT FAIRLY NEW ONLY COME INTO EFFECT ON JULY. ONE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND UNFORTUNATELY NOT HAVING A SPECIFIC -- DISCAL PRE ENROLLMENT DISCLOSURE MANDATE -- FOR SAR -- WE'RE REALLY TAKING AND AND TO BE HAVE A VERY ACTIVE SOCIAL MEDIA PRESENCE -- WEBSITE -- REACHING OUT TO STUDENTS DIRECTLY THROUGH VARIOUS CHANNELS AND IT THROUGH OUR PARTNERS THAT YOU MENTIONED -- THROUGH OUR ADVISORY COMMITTEE HAVE DONE SEVERAL PRESENTATIONS -- AS MANY AS MUCH AS I CAN TO GET THE WORD OUT YOU KNOW THAT WE'VE DON THAT WE'RE HERE THAT WE'RE HERE TO HELP STUDENTS. THEY WERE COMMITTED TO HELP STUDENTS THAT WERE RESOURCE -- THAT'S WHAT I'M I'M STILL IN THE PROCESS OF EFFORT NEED YOU WE'VE DEVELOPED A LOT OF COLLATERAL MATERIALS AS WELL KIND OF DONE IT THE OLD FASHIONED WAY YOU KNOW BOOTS ON THE GROUND. ONE OF MY HOPES WOULD BE AND AND I'VE MENTIONED THIS PREVIOUSLY A SORT OF A LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL WOULD BE. TO IN FACT HAVE A REQUIRE PRE ENROLLMENT DISCLOSURE -- FOR SAR SO THAT THE NOT ONLY SCHOOLS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO KNOW ABOUT US BUT THEY BE REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE THAT INFORMATION TO STUDENTS PRE ENROLLMENT AND ALSO MANAGER. IT WOULD THERE BE AN AUDITING PROCESS TO TO SEE THE WARNING SIGNS. THAT YOU NEED TO STEP IN AND SAY HEY THIS MAY HAPPEN. LET'S START WORKING TOGETHER. I THINK I REMEMBER THE FUTURE AT THE END THAT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE FUTURE OF THE STUDENTS. OUR DIRECT -- YEAH THE I THINK THAT WOULD BE I ANY ANY STRING THING WE CAN DO IN THAT AREA WOULD BE WELCOMED WE CERTAINLY ARE. WE BEING MYSELF IS IS DIRECTLY INVOLVED WITH ALL THE DISCUSSIONS AND MEETINGS WITH THE OTHER BUREAU CHIEF SPECIFICALLY. AROUND ENFORCEMENT AND DISCIPLINE -- WHEN THEY'RE I WAS AWARE OF -- THEY DEFINITELY COME ON TO SARS RADAR WE BEGIN RESEARCHING OTHER COMPARABLE SCHOOLS AND PROGRAMS IN THE AREA IF WE FEEL LIKE -- THAT RED RED FLAG IS POTENTIALLY HEADING TOWARDS CLOSURE -- SO -- BUT JUST IN GENERAL YOU KNOW SOMEONE EARLIER MENTIONED THAT. STRICT ELIGIBILITY HAS BEEN EXPANDED TO PROGRAM JUST CONTINUATIONS AS WELL SO IF AN INSTITUTION FOR EXAMPLE -- STOPS OFFERING A PARTICULAR EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING DEGREE PROGRAM -- BUT BUT CONTINUES TO STAY OPEN AS AN INSTITUTION -- OR HAS THAT THE APPROVAL OR THIRTY TO OFFER THAT PROGRAM TAKEN AWAY BY ANOTHER PARTY -- THEN WE ARE INVOLVED IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE AS WELL GET IN GET THOSE ROSTERS TALK TO STUDENTS ABOUT. TRANSFER OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL AN AREA BUT AND LIKE I SAID I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU ANY STRENGTHENING WE CAN DO AT AND IN TERMS OF EARLY. WARNING I I WOULD IT ONLY HELPS MY JOBS. I AND I WOULD THINK ANY PUNITIVE ACTION -- CAN BE PREVENTED WITH COMMUNICATIONS BECAUSE ANYONE WHO'S TO ADMINISTERS THE SCHOOLS AND AND MAYBE LOOKS TO EXPAND OR WHATEVER AND IF THEY HAVE A HISTORY OF NEGATIVITY. WITH THE BUREAU YOURSELF. BACK IN -- I WOULD HOPE STOP THEM FROM EXPANDING. SO THAT'S WHY IT'S IT'LL VITAL TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOU I AGREE. THANK YOU MA'AM SHOULD CONSIDER ARCHULETA YOUR GLAZER. THANK YOU MISTER ABOUT THEIR DAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY I I SO APPRECIATE ALL THE WORKS. OF YOUR OFFICE THANK YOU ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE -- REVIEWED WITH US ARE SO IMPORTANT -- THAT A LOT OF THEM ARE -- IN REACTION TO BAD THINGS HAPPENING BUT I ALSO APPRECIATE YOUR EMPHASIS ON PRODUCTIVITY I CERTAINLY WANT TO COMMEND SENATOR HILL WHO AUTHORED THE LEGISLATION THAT CREATED YOUR OFFICE -- FOR THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT YOU DO HACER. NOW WE'RE CURRENTLY ALLOCATED TEN PERMANENT POSITIONS AND WE HAVE SEVEN OF THOSE TEN POSITIONS FILLED CURRENTLY AND ARE ACTIVELY LOOKING. TO FILL THOSE THREE VACANT POSITIONS AND WIRE THOSE THREE VACANT POSITIONS THERE. WE HAD TWO OF THEM WERE FILLED AND YOU KNOW WE HAD BOTH MOVE ON FOR ONE IS A PROMOTIONAL OPPORTUNITY ONE IT WAS A A LIFE OPPORTUNITY AND WE'RE WE'RE LIKE I SAID WE'RE WE'RE ACTIVELY TRYING TO REFILL THOSE NOW. GREAT THANK YOU SO I WANT. TO TOUCH THREE AREAS OF QUESTIONS THE FIRST ONE WAS -- IN TERMS OF YOUR PROACTIVE WORK AND YOU EMPHASIZE THAT IN YOUR REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE. OF THE THINGS THAT YOU DO TO GET OUT IN FRONT OF STUDENTS ARE POTENTIAL STUDENTS. AND YOU TALK ABOUT -- THAT YOU DO -- CONDUCT INDUSTRY IN ENFORCEMENT RELATED RESEARCH YET FOR SPENT RELATED RESEARCH WE DO AND THAT THAT INFORMATION CAN BE PROVIDED TO PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS AT COLLEGE FAIRS AND WORKSHOPS CORRECT I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE QUESTION THAT I ASKED THAT. THE BUREAU CHIEF OF A FEW MINUTES AGO. WHICH IS THAT HOW WHAT WORK DO YOU UNDERTAKE TO BE AWARE OF ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES THAT OCCUR IN OTHER STATES. IN OTHER IN OTHER STATES CORRECT SOFT ITHACA COLLEGE THE NATIONAL COLLEGE IT IS HAD. ENFORCEMENT ACTION TAKEN AGAINST THEM AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD COME TO YOUR ATTENTION -- POSSIBLE POSSIBLY YOU KNOW IF IT I THINK IF IT CAME ON THE ON THE RADAR OF THE JURORS ENFORCEMENT. UNIT THEN I WOULD DEFINITELY BE AWARE OF IT AS WELL BECAUSE I'M INVOLVED IN ALL THOSE -- MEETINGS -- WHAT I WOULD SAY IS IN OUR FOR JUSTICE I'M SORRY SHOULD MENTION THIS EARLIER KIND OF THE MECHANISM OF HOW THAT INFORMATION IS SHARED WITH STUDENTS? IN OUR OUT REACHED EVENTS IS IS INFORMED BY THAT IT RESEARCH THAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT IS REFERENCED IN THE STATUTE AS WELL. ONE OF THE EFFORTS WE DID IS WE WENT BACK WE BEING -- STAR STAFF WENT BACK AND TOOK A PRETTY DEEP DIVE INTO -- THE NATURE OF THE MOST COMMON COMPLAINTS THAT THE BUREAU HAS RECEIVED OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. AND EVALUATE ALL THESE CLOSE ALL THOSE CLUSTERED THEM LOOK AT THEM CLOSELY AND THEN USE THEM TO BOTH VALIDATE SOME OF OUR TALKING POINTS AROUND RED FLAGS. AND ADD TO THEM AS WELL SO THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT SORT OF GENERAL MESSAGING RIGHT THAT NE OF THE THINGS TO LOOK OUT FOR WOULD BE. X. Y. Z. MISREPRESENTATION POLLUTION RATES OR ORAL OR LACK OF DISCLOSURE OR OTHER TYPES OF RED FLAGS -- A RUSH TO SIGN IN ROMAN DOCUMENTS -- NOT ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS -- WE HAVE A WHOLE LIST OF THEM THAT'S IN OUR THAT'S OUR SORT OF STOCK TALKING POINTS MANY OF THOSE LIKE I SAID WERE VALIDATED BY. OR ADDED TO OUR TALK LIST OF TALKING POINTS BASED ON REAL CASES THAT THE BUREAU HAS SEEN OVER TIME AS WELL. THIS TRIED TO TRY TO MAKE STUDENTS INFORMED AND AWARE WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING AT THESE INSTITUTIONS THAT THEY'RE KEEPING THEIR EYE OUT FOR THOSE THINGS IN ITS IN ITS AGAIN IT'S BASED ON A REALITY IN THE SENSE OF THOSE ARE ACTUAL COMPLAINTS THAT OTHER STUDENTS HAVE HAD AND SIMILAR SCHOOLS. NOW AS IT RELATES -- TO SCHOOLS OUT OF STATE I THINK THE ONLY CONNECTION POINTS I CAN REALLY THINK OF OUR THE OTHER THING THAT WE HAVE IN OUR TALKING POINTS ARE -- ITS RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT REVIEWING ACCREDITATION STATUS OF SCHOOLS -- IF THERE'S ANY THIRD PARTY -- APPROVED FOR OF THE PROGRAM -- TOOLS AND TIPS AND RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO RESEARCH THOSE. TO SOME OF YOUR PREVIOUS COMMENTS AS WELL ABOUT INFORMATION BEING PUBLIC SO -- WE HAVE WE HAVE TALKING POINTS ABOUT ANY -- PUBLICLY AWARE AVAILABLE IN MINISTRY OF ACTIONS AGAINST THE SCHOOL -- PREVIOUSLY THAT SOMETHING THAT WE ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO TAKE A LOOK AT MUCH OF WHICH IS ON THE BUREAU SITE UNDER THE DISCIPLINE PAGE BUT BUT IN IN IN YOUR EXAMPLE YES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY TAKE THEM. OUTSIDE OF STATE AS WELL -- I CAN THINK OF ONE I CAN ONLY DO ONE PERSONAL EXAMPLE OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD IN THE MOMENT BUT I IT ONE OF THE CAL TAP THE VINCE -- THE THE THE WITH QUE VETERANS LOOKING AT USING THEIR G. I. pWITH THE STUDENT THAT WAS LOOKING AT A SCHOOL IN IOWA. AND ABOUT THEIR ACCREDITATION IN THEIR PROFESSIONAL ACCREDITATION STANDARDS IN THEIR PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION THAT OVERSAW THAT PROGRAM. AND THE DISCUSSION IN REAL TIME JUST TIONS WHERE THEY WERE OTHER STATES AND SO I AGREE WITH YOU I I FALL I I FIND THAT TO BE UNDER THE STARR'S PURVIEW BECAUSE IT DOES TALK ABOUT PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS AND PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS. ARE OFTEN NOT ONLY WAYNE PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY INSTITUTION IN CALIFORNIA VERSUS ANOTHER BUT OFTEN PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY INSTITUTION VERSUS PUBLIC POSTSECONDARY INSTITUTION OR IN STATE VERSUS OUT OF STATE. SO S. I I I I AGREE WITH YOU WE JUST HAVEN'T HAD A TON OF EXAMPLES OF OF OF THE OUT OF STATE COMPONENT. IS A LOT A LOT THANK YOU FOR THAT A LOT OF THE A LOT OF THESE NATIONAL SCHOOLS THEY THEY THEY ADVERTISED TO GET CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS TO ENROLL IS THAT WOULD THAT BE FAIR TO SAY. YES AND HE A ARE YOU IN A POSITION TO SEE THE CLAIMS THEY MAKE IN THAT ADVERTISEMENTS THOSE EVER I HAVE SEEN THOSE YES. AND ARE YOU ABLE TO GO OUT AND VERIFY WHETHER THEY'RE TRUE OR THEY'RE NOT. WE DON'T HAVE THAT WITHIN OUR SCOPE BUT AGAIN WE DO A I ENCOURAGE STUDENTS AGAIN AND ARE TALKING POINTS TO LOOK AT IF THERE IF THEY ARE -- EITHER FORMALLY OR OUT OFTEN IS IN NOT IT'S ON THEIR WEBSITE SOMETIMES IT MIGHT JUST BE INFORMATION THAT THEY'VE GOTTEN IN COMMUNICATION WITH AN ADMISSIONS COUNSELOR -- WE TALK A LOT IN OUR WORKSHOPS ABOUT PREDATORY ADMISSIONS AND THAT WOULD BE ONE COMPONENT OF THAT. THAT OFTEN TAKES US TO A DISCUSSION WHERE THEY ARE. LOOKING AT THAT OTHER STATE OR IF IT'S A WITHIN CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW THERE ARE THERE ARE ACTUAL TRACK RECORD OF PLACING STUDENTS AND EARNING THE WAGES OF THEIR IT'S IT'S NOT IT'S NOT PERFECT AND YOU KNOW I I I AGREE TO ANYTHING WE CAN STRENGTHEN IN THAT AREA I WOULD. I WOULD BE SUPPORT OF US BUT WE ARE ANY PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION. RIGHT WELL I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT CLARIFICATION BECAUSE I THINK IT IS WITHIN THE YEARS AGO THAT I AND YOUR RESPONSIBILITY -- SO YOU YOU -- YOU MENTION THAT A LOT OF THIS INFORMATION IS SHARED THROUGH WORKSHOPS YOU HAVE ALL THAT ON YOUR WEB PAGES IT EASILY ACCESSIBLE AND TO ANY PROSPECTIVE STUDENT. WE DO YES YEAH WE HAVE THE WORKSHOPS WERE WORKSHOPS SCHEDULE THERE WE HAVE A RESEARCHING COLLEGES -- BROCHURE WITH SOME TIPS WE HAVE WHAT ABOUT THE WORRISOME ISSUES THAT THE CLUSTER OF COMPLAINTS AND HOW YOU. ADDRESS THOSE IN YOU SHARED INFORMATION WITH PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS ABOUT BEING RUSHED JOHN TRACTOR. THEIR VACATION ABOUT EMPLOYMENT YEAH I DO I DON'T BELIEVE. I DON'T WANNA SPEAK OUT OF TURN I'M NOT POSITIVE WHETHER OUR MOST UPDATED VERSION OF THE POWER POINT THAT WE USE WHEN WE'RE OUT DOING THE PRESENTATION THAT HAS ALL THOSE TALKING POINTS. IS CURRENTLY UP LOADED BUT IT'S DEFINITELY -- AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS WE DEFINITELY PROVIDED TO THEM WHEN WE'RE ON SITE WE DEFINITELY GIVE THEM THE WORK THOUGH THAT'S WHAT I'M FLYING. YEAH I I APPRECIATE HOW WHAT ONE ON ONE IS THE BEST YOU'RE APT. BUT GREED IS THAT HAVE REALLY MOST KIDS HOW MANY HOW WHAT'S THE ENROLLMENT NUMBERS AND THEN HOW MANY OF YOU TOUCHING YEAH SO I HEAR YOU SEEMS LIKE IF YOU IT AND YOU TALK ABOUT THIS ABOUT YOU YOU UTILIZING. YOUR WEB PAGE AND TRADITIONAL MEDIANS ET TALK ABOUT THIS IN YOUR REPORT THE LEGISLATURE BUT IF YOU'RE NOT REALLY UTILIZING IT TOO NO WE THIS ALL YEAH. NO I WAS JUST SPEAKING ABOUT THAT SPECIFIC POWER POINT WITH THOSE SPECIFIC DATA FROM THE RESEARCH THAT WE SEARCH WE DID FOR SURE THAT THE GENERAL TALKING POINTS THE RED FLAGS THE THE RECOMMENDATIONS -- LINKS TO A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT ARE IN THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AS A RESOURCE ARE ALL THERE. AND AND I I HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP IT IS UPDATED WE CAN WEAR LITTLE UNDER RESOURCE THING. KINDA GET KIND OF IN A STRETCH RIGHT NOW WITH THE CLOSURES TO KEEP EVERYTHING UPDATED BUT IT'S DEFINITELY WITHIN I I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT'S ON THE WEBSITE CURRENTLY. ON ENCOURAGING TO BE MORE ROBUST THAT'S ALL AND WHAT YOU PROVIDE RESHAPE THAT THE COUPLE OTHER IS QUICKLY. WE'VE WITH YOU'VE RAISED THE ISSUE ABOUT SHORT NOTICE ON CLOSURES. PREVIOUS -- WITNESSES OF RACE THAT THE CONCERNED ABOUT SHORT NOTICES -- YOU MADE REFERENCE TO AT SOME OF THAT OCCURS BECAUSE OF THE LOSS OF FINANCIAL AID AT THAT'S THE FEDERAL HAMMER COMING DOWN. WHICH MADE QUICKLY FORCES THE BY THE INSTITUTION SAFE WE'RE NOT GETTING. ALRIGHT SO WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT THAT IF THE IF THE FEDS ARE MAKING A DECISION ABOUT CUTTING OFF FINANCIAL AID DO THEY PROVIDE ANY OF THOSE PRELIMINARY SIGNALS TO YOU SO YOU CAN PREPARE FOR A CLOSURE -- NOT NOT NOT TO ME PERSONALLY OR TO SIR BUT THEY DO MAKE THE BUREAU AWARE OFTHE VARIOUS TYPES OF DISCIPLINE STATUS IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT ISSUES -- INCLUDING HEIGHTENED CASH BEING ONE OF THE WORST ONES BUT THERE ARE OTHERS. EXCUSE ME THEIR OTHER STATUSES AS WELL THAT THEY TO MAKE THE BUREAU AWARE OF AND THN THE ENFORCEMENT -- UNIT IN COLLABORATION WITH OTHER UNITS -- ATTRACT THOSE IT IS THIS BEFORE THE FACT YOU'RE AFTER THE FACT THIS IS BEFORE. VERY GOOD THAT'S HAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOW FINALLY LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THE STUDENT TUITION RECOVERY FIND. I HOW HOW MUCH IS CURRENTLY IN THAT FUD ARTS APPROXIMATELY TWENTY SIX MILLION TWENTY FIVE POINT SOMETHING MILLION. AT OTHER CAPS UNDER LEGISLATION AS TO WHAT AT A WE ARE AT THOSE CAP LEVELS WE ARE. AND IS THAT MAKES SENSE TO YOU TODAY THAT WERE CAPPING THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S GOING INTO THIS FIND. IT DOES -- I WOULD SAY THAT'S A VERY DYNAMIC THING IN AND SOMETHING TO REALLY KEEP OUR EYES ON WITH EACH THREE LARGE CLOSURES THAT WE JUST HAVE TALKED ABOUT TODAY HAVE NOT HAVEN'T -- REALLY -- HIT THAT YET -- I I ANTICIPATE THAT IT WILL PACKED WHETHER THE CAP IS SOMETHING THAT WILL BE TRACKING CLOSELY -- BECAUSE THAT WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON ON THE INSTITUTIONS -- AND AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS BUT I THINK WE'RE I THINK WE'RE SOLID RIGHT NOW. IT WILL I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN ANY ANY REGULATIONS YOU THINK OR TOO CONSTRICTING. THAT WE SHOULD RE EVALUATE GIVEN WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE MARKET PLACE GETTING GIVEN HOW MANY STUDENTS HAVE BEEN POTENTIALLY HURT -- BY THESE CLOSURES I THINK MY COLLEAGUES WOULD BE OPEN MINDED TO THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO BETTER PROTECT THOSE STUDENTS AND IF WE HAVE A STATUTORY CAP ON A FIND. AT THIS GOING TO LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO BE RESPONSIVE I THINK WOULD BE INTERESTED IN THAT. AND WE APPRECIATE THAT OUT OF JAIL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THAT'S HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS. YOU TALK ABOUT THE SCHOOLS THAT HAVE CLOSER ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED STUDENTS IN EACH SCHOOL AND I THINK YOU SAID THAT YOU HAD SOME IN PERSON MEETINGS HAVE -- AND REACH ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE STUDENTS THE MORE THAN THAT IT WAS CLEAR THAT IT WAS ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED THAT ACTUALLY ATTENDED THE OKAY THE WORKSHOPS THAT THAT TWO HUNDRED WHATEVER NUMBER IT WAS WAS. A CLAIMS FILED TO DATE FLETCHER. SO THE TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS IT DIDN'T COME IN PERSON DO YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR INFORMATION TO THE YOU COULD SEND THEM A LETTER WE DO YEAH WE DO IN THIS CASE. QUITE SPEAKING VERY FRANKLY. AS BAD IN AND IN AND FORTUNATE AND AND HAS MANY NEGATIVE THINGS THAT CAME OUT OF THE CA CLOSURES ONE OF THE GOOD THINGS -- WAS THAT THEY PROVIDED VERY -- THOROUGH A TIMELY ROSTERS -- WELL BEFORE THE CLOSURE AND I REALLY THING WE NEEDED IN TERMS OF CONTACT INFORMATION A NON SCHOOL ISSUE EMAILS PHONE NUMBERS. PROGRAM SO WE GOT ALL THAT OF THE REASON THAT NUMBER SO LARGE AS WELL -- I I BELIEVEDEBBIE MENTION OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN MENTIONED EARLIER THAT. WE CONSIDER IN CALCULATING QUANTIFY IN THAT IMPACTED NUMBER STUDENTS WHO ARE ENROLLED WITHIN ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS OF CLOSURE BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY THIS JEFF ELIGIBILITY WORKS -- SO THERE WASN'T NECESSARILY TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED STUDENTS ENROLLED ON THE DAY OF THE CLOSURE BUT AND SO MANY OF THEM -- ARE ARE THOSE WHO'VE COMPLETED EARLIER A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT TO TRACK DOWN. BUT WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN WE WE USE ALL THOSE METHODS OF COMMUNICATION TO REACH OUT WITH THEM QUITE FRANKLY SOCIAL MEDIA OFTEN BEING THE MOST EFFECTIVE. AGREE GOOD THAT'S WHAT I WAS HOPING AT THAT YOU WERE DOING. WHAT RECOURSE IS AVAILABLE FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WHO SUFFER ECONOMIC LOSS DUE TO UNLAWFUL ACTIVITIES MORE CLOSURES OF A PRIVATE SCHOOL? YES SO FOR ANYTHING -- THAT THE STUDENT HAS PAID OUT OF POCKET THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR REIMBURSEMENT UNDER THOSE TERMS YOU MENTIONED TO THE STUDENT TUITION RECOVERY FUND. FOR THOSE STUDENTS WHO TOOK OUT A TITLE FOR FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID LOANS -- FOR FOR TO PAY FOR THEIR TUITION THEY'RE ELIGIBLE -- FOR TO HAVE THOSE LOANS DISCHARGED COOL DISCHARGED PROGRAM. AND THEN FOR STUDENTS WHOSE PROGRAM WAS PAID FOR BY A THIRD PARTY FOR EXAMPLE -- WE ISN'T AS ONE EXAMPLE THEN WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO ISSUE AN EDUCATIONAL CREDIT TO ANOTHER INSTITUTION THAT'S ALSO APPROVED BY WE IF THE STUDENT. WE OWE A IF THE STUDENT TRANSFERS TO THAT SCHOOL -- GOOD. FIVE THERE'S NO FURTHER QUESTIONS GENTLEMEN WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME YES PLEASE DOCTOR MARILYN NUMBERS YOU ASKED ABOUT -- COMPLAINTS OVER THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS THREE FIVE HOW MANY NINETY FIVE THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE ALL RIGHT VERY GOOD THANK YOU WE HOPE THAT THAT NUMBER CAN GET REDUCE QUICKLY. OVER THE YEARS A LONG TIME. TIME GOES BY. AND I THINK YOU WHAT YOU PROBABLY HEARD FROM ALL OF US IS WE WANT TO BE HELPFUL WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STUDENTS. ARE EITHER GETTING A GOOD EDUCATION OR THEY'RE NOT HARMED BY THE PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION PROCESS. AGAIN I WILL REINFORCE THAT WE'D LOVE TO HAVE IDEAS FOR LEGISLATION WHAT WE DO LET US BE HELPFUL SO THAT YOU CAN DO YOUR JOB BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE TODAY WE APPRECIATE IT. AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO OPEN IT UP -- FOR PUBLIC COMMENT IF THERE'S ANYONE AND FROM THE PUBLIC WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK. PLEASE COME FORWARD. I THINK THIS MICROPHONE OVER HERE IS PROBABLY ON THANK YOU VERY WELCOME THANK YOU HI MY NAME IS BOB CHAIRMAN I AM A SENIOR FELLOW AT THE CENTURY FOUNDATION. WHICH IS BASED IN NEW YORK I'M A BORN AND RAISED CALIFORNIA AND WAS IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION WORKING ON HIGHER EDUCATION POLICY -- I WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS HEARING TODAY I THINK IS -- EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ISSUE OF CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE BEEN -- POORLY TREATED BY BY COLLEGES AND I THINK YOU'RE GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION OF THINKING ABOUT HOW CAN WE HELP THE STUDENTS WHO WERE HARMED AND HOW WE CAN PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE -- SENATOR LABOR YOU ASKED ABOUT -- WHAT ARE SOME OF THE COMMON ELEMENTS OF SOME OF THESE CLOSURES AND I WANTED TO PROVIDE -- ONE ONE ANSWER TO THAT WHICH MIGHT BE A SIGNAL. FOR SOME OF THE THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE AROUND PREVENTION -- THE CALAMITOUS CLOSURES WHERE THEIR SUDDEN AND LOTS AND LOTS OF STUDENTS TEND TO HAVE A COUPLE OF ELEMENTS TO THEM ONE IS THAT THEY TEND TO BE COLLEGES. BETTER FOCUSED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON ROLLING PEOPLE WITH FINANCIAL AID AND THE REASON THAT HALF OF THE REASON THEIR THAT HAPPENS IS THAT THEY ARE AVOIDING ANY INTERACTION WHERE THEY HAVE TO ACTUALLY MAKE THE VALUE CASE OF THE THE KIND OF WHAT WHAT WOULD BE A NORMAL. VALUE CASE FOR THE THE THE VALUE OF THE DEGREE FOR THE MONEY INSTEAD THEY'RE SAYING WE'RE ACCREDITED WERE APPROVED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THERE'S MONEY AVAILABLE AND LETTING THE STUDENT ASSUME THAT. THE PRICE MUST BE OKAY WITH THE GOVERNMENT OR ELSE THEY WOULD NOT ALLOW THEM TO GET THAT MONEY AND THEY LOAD THEM UP WITH. THEIR WITH WITH THE PELL GRANT WITH AND ROLLING IN FOR A LENGTHY PERIOD STUDENT THINKS THEY'RE GETTING A QUALITY EDUCATION AND THEY DON'T REALIZE TILL THEY TRY TO GET A JOB THAT THAT IT'S NOT RELATE. YOU NOT NOT RELATE THAT SERVING THEM THE OTHER ELEMENT OF IT IS THAT THOSE INSTITUTIONS I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS WHEN DR MARION TALKED ABOUT THE FIX THAT TICKET -- AND AND HOW YOU KNOW THIS IN A LOT OF THESE SITUATIONS THAT'S NOT GOING TO THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE. ENOUGH BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE SITUATIONS ARE WHERE. EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THE COLLEGE IS. HAS A ROLE WHERE THEIR ROLE IS EXTRACTING MONEY FROM THAT KNOWLEDGE SO RATHER THAN HAVING THE AGENTS AND TRUSTEES. WHO ARE OVERSEEING THE COLLEGE FROM THE STANDPOINT OF A GIVE HER SOMEONE WHO IS DONATING THEIR TIME DONATING MONEY THEY WANTED TO BE A GREAT COLLEGE THEY WANT THE OUTCOMES TO BE WONDERFUL INSTEAD OF? INSTEAD EVERYBODY WHO'S DRIVING THAT COLLEGE IS FOCUSED ON HOW CAN I GET AS MUCH OF IT AT FOR ME AS I CAN WHETHER ME OR MY INVESTORS. THAT I AM -- I AM REPRESENTING AND THAT IS DRIVING THE ACTIVITIES SO IT MEANS. THERE'S A MOMENT IN TIME WHEN A SCHOOL IS WHEN WHEN THE PEOPLE INSIDE THE SCHOOL KNOW. THAT THE SHIP IS GOING DOWN BUT NOBODY ON THE OUTSIDE KNOWS ABOUT IT. THAT IS THE MOMENT WHEN THE WHEN IT MATTERS THE MOST WHAT THOSE PEOPLE'S FINANCIAL INCENTIVES ARE BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED AN ITT TECH FOR EXAMPLE ALL THE EXECUTIVES BASICALLY GRABBED EVERYTHING THEY COULD FOR THEMSELVES. AND THE CURRENT AND THE CURRENT INVEST WHAT WAS GOING ON THERE WASN'T ANYTHING LEFT FOR THE STUDENTS ARE FRANKLY EVEN TO STAY OPEN LONG ENOUGH TO FINISH. THE SEMESTER SO THAT DYNAMIC DRIVES THE CALAMITOUS KINDS OF CLOSURES THANK YOU SO MUCH HAPPY TO HELP WITH ANYTHING THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU.
