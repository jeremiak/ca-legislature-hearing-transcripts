I THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT TODAY I'M GOING TO BE PRESENTING SENATE BILL EIGHT NINETY FOUR WHICH WILL REQUIRE COMPETITION OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLES TO BE REGISTERED IN ORDER TO RIDE ON PUBLIC LANDS URRENTLY COMPETITION THE MODELS TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND OTHER ARE REGISTERED THROUGH CARBS RED STICKER PROGRAM THREE YEARS AGO CAR DECIDED TO END THIS RED STICKER PROGRAM AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND NO OTHER AGENCY PUT TOGETHER A PLAN TO REPLACE THE PROGRAM. THEREFORE COMPETITION ALWAYS V. MODELS TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND NEWER HAVE NO WAY TO REGISTER. WITH THE DMV. MEANWHILE OTHER MODELS TO STILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY JUST- UNDER THE RED STICKER PROGRAM. THIS GAP LEAVES RIDERS WITHOUT THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTATION THAT IS REQUIRED FOR A DEALER TO FINANCE A NEW PURCHASE. OR FOR AN OWNER TO SECURE INSURANCE. ADDITIONALLY LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NOT ABLE TO TRACK TRACE AND SITE ILLEGAL AND ROGO H. V. WRITING. OF THESE NEWER MODELS. THIS THE NEW MODELS CAME ON THE MARKET THE OAG COMMUNITY HAS BEEN THROWN INTO CONFUSION. WITH REPORTS OF. SOME BEING WRONGFULLY DENIED FOR REGISTRATION AND SOME BEING WRONGFULLY APPROVED FOR REGISTRATION. WITH OR WITHOUT THIS BILL COMPETITION WHICH V. RIDING ON PUBLIC LANDS WILL BE RESTRICTED TO CLOSE COURSES. THIS BILL MAY LOOK FAMILIAR TO THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE IT THIS IS THE THIRD AND I HOPE THIRD TIME IS A CHARM- BRING HIS BILL- TO COMMITTEE. WE HAVE- SPENT THREE YEARS WORKING WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING- ISSUE COMPETITION ORGANIZATIONS- AG MANUFACTURES AND SEVERAL STATE AGENCIES TO CRAFT A REGISTRATION PROGRAM THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE. SINCE THIS BILL WAS LAST SEEN BY THIS COMMITTEE IT HAS TAKEN AMENDMENTS THAT REMOVED ALL PREVIOUS OPPOSITION. AND WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY NEW OPPOSITION TO CROP UP THIS YEAR. AS THE A.

DESPITE THE FACT THAT NEWER COMPETITION SO MODELS ARE STILL AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE IN CALIFORNIA. I HAVE WITNESSED THE CHAOS CREATED BY THAT DECISION WHERE WE NOW HAVE AN ENTIRE CLASS THE VOICE OF REASON HAVE NO REGISTRATION OR IDENTIFYING DETAILS THAT MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE. FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO IDENTIFY THE VEHICLE WHICH CAN LEAD TO ILLEGAL USING CLOSED OR SENSITIVE AREAS OR TRESPASS ON PRIVATE PROPERTY.

EIGHT NINE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES NOT HAVE THE DMV REGISTRATION NECESSARY TO CITE ILLEGAL AND ROGUE WRITERS.

AT THE MEETINGS AND- MANAGING MONEY MANAGER AND MEMBERS. THAT I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT SP NINE FORTY TWO WHICH WILL PROVIDE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC TRANSIT AGENCIES. THE AUTHORIZATION OF FLEXIBILITY TO UTILIZE FUNDS UNDER CALIFORNIA'S LOW CARBON. TRANSIT OPERATIONS PROGRAM OFTEN REFERRED TO AS L. C. TUB. TO SUPPORT FREE OR REDUCED FARE TRANSIT PROGRAMS. ON AN ONGOING BASIS. THE APPLICATION OF LC TOP FUNDS IN THIS MANNER WILL PROVIDE FOR THE LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY AND BENEFITS. OF FORWARD THINKING TRANSIT PROGRAMS SUCH AS FREE AND REDUCED FAIR. USE RUSSIAN PROGRAMS THAT EXPAND ACCESS TO PUBLIC TRANSIT. AND CREATE LIFELONG TRANSIT RIDERS WHILE REDUCING. GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS LC TOP WHICH REGION CREATED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN BY S. B.EIGHT SIXTY TWO. AS PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE OF PROGRAMS TARGETING GHG. EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS IN CALIFORNIA. USING FUNDS GENERATED BY THE STATE'S GROUNDBREAKING CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNSTABLE COMMUNITIES TRANSIT AND INTERCITY RAIL CAPITAL AND OPERATING PROJECTS. AND HIGH SPEED RAIL LC TOP IS A MINISTER BY CALTRANS. AND IS FUNDED THROUGH A CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION OF FIVE PERCENT. OF GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS GENERATED BY CAP AND TRADE. FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEAR APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. WAS SLATED FOR ALLOCATION. TO LC TOP. AS NOTED ONE OF THE FOUNDATION FOUNDATIONAL GOALS OF LC TOP IS THE PROVISION OF OPERATING AND CAPITAL SYSTEMS. TO TRANSIT AGENCIES TO IMPROVE MOBILITY WHILE REDUCING GHGS WITH A PRIORITY ON SERVING DISADVANTAGED. COMMUNITIES TODAY'S BILL BUILDS ON SP ELEVEN NINETEEN PASSING TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHICH CONTAIN PROVISIONS FOR TRANSIT AGENCIES TO INVEST LC TOP FUNDS. IN THREE AREAS PURSUANT TO MEETING THE OVERALL STATUTORY REQUIREMENT. OF PROVIDING A BENEFIT. TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THOSE THREE AREAS WERE. ONE FUNNY TRANSIT FARE SUBSIDIES INCLUDING STUDENT TRANSIT PASSES. TO FUNNY TRANSIT CONNECTIONS TO MAJOR EMPLOYMENT AREAS EDUCATION CENTERS OR MEDICAL FACILITIES FOR RESIDENTS OF DISADVANTAGED OR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. OR THREE FUNNY TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS THAT REDUCE EMISSIONS OF GREENHOUSE. GASES INCLUDING THE APPLICATION ELSE THE TOP FIVE FOR THE PER. OF ZERO BUSES AND FUELING IN FOR. UNDER THE PROVISION OF SB ELEVEN NINETEEN TRANSIT AGENCY CAN ONLY USE LC TOP FUNDS ONCE PER SIX MONTH PROGRAM INTERVAL MEANING THAT THEY ARE REQUIRED TO REAPPLY IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO ADMINISTER AN APPROVED PROGRAM. EVEN IF THE POPULATION SERVED HAS NOT CHANGED BECAUSE THE PROGRAM REQUIRES REGULAR RIGOROUS EMISSION REDUCTION ANALYSIS AND OTHER REPORTING THIS BILL WILL REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE BARRIERS WHILE ALLOWING FOR LONGER PERIODS OF APPROVAL THEREBY EXTENDING AND EXPANDING. THE BENEFITS OF THE PROGRAM OVER THE PAST DECADE ESPECIALLY IN A PANDEMIC TRANSIT AGENCIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA HAS STRIVED TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT FREE AND REDUCED TRANSFER PROGRAMS. UNFORTUNATELY A LACK OF AVAILABLE FUNDING FOR ME TO ANY PROGRAMS ON A LONG TERM BASIS HAS STYMIED THOSE EFFORTS. IN ORANGE COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE THE ORANGE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY HAS SUCCESSFULLY OPERATED LC TOUGH FUNDED YOUTH RIDE FREE PROGRAM ALLOWING YOUNG WRITERS AGES EIGHTEEN AND UNDER TO ACCESS ALL ORANGE COUNTY FIXED ROUTE BUSES. AT NO COST THIS SIX MONTH POLICY TOP PILOT BEGINNING SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE WITH PASSES THAT WERE VALID THROUGH FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHTH OF THIS YEAR. SINCE THE PROGRAM'S INCEPTION THE NUMBER OF YOUTH RIDERS HAS INCREASED STEADILY FROM SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE. TO OVER TWELVE THOUSAND RIDERS IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT THE PROGRAM IS SUCCEEDING IN ITS AIM OF CULTIVATING A GENERATION OF NEW AND HOPEFULLY LIFELONG WRITER. IS PROMISING IF RUSSIA PROGRAM HAS ALSO PROVIDED A SECONDARY BENEFIT OF SUPPORTING ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN ORANGE COUNTY IN THE WAKE OF THE PANDEMIC. PARTICULARLY AMONG ORANGE COUNTY'S LOW INCOME AND DIVERSE POPULATIONS UNFORTUNATELY HOWEVER WHILE THE INITIAL PILOT PROGRAM QUALIFIED TO UTILIZE LC TOP FUNDING. THE EXISTING STATUTORY RESTRICTIONS NOTED EARLIER RENDER LC TOP AN UNSUSTAINABLE SOURCE OF ONGOING FUNDING IRRESPECTIVE OF THE INITIAL SUCCESS FOR LONG TERM PROSPECTS AND BENEFITS OF THIS PROGRAM. UPON PASSAGE OF ANTI BEST BE NINE FORTY TWO CALIFORNIA TRANSIT AGENCY WILL BE AUTHORIZED TO USE LC TOP MONIES FOR THE FUNDING OF FREE. OR REDUCED FARE TRANSIT PROGRAMS AND TO CONTINUE TO USE THOSE FOR TO MAKE THOSE PRO. ON AN ONGOING. PROVIDED THAT THE POPULATION OR OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE PROGRAM HAVE NOT CHANGED IN SO DOING S. B. NINE FORTY TWO WILL PROVIDE MULTIPLE SIMULTANEOUS BENEFITS. REDUCING GREENHOUSE GREENHOUSE GASES EXPANDING MASS TRANSIT UTILIZATION BY CREATIVE LIFELONG WRITERS REDUCING CONGESTION ON OUR STREETS. AND OFFERING AN AVENUE FOR ECONOMIC IMPROVEMENT TO FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS. HERE WITH ME TO TESTIFY THIS MORNING- MISTER GERALD JOHNSON THE C. E. O. OF THE ORANGE COUNTY TRANSIT AUTHORITY. AND MR MICHAEL PIMENTEL EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. FOR A TRIP TO SUSPICION I AM RESPECTFULLY ASKING FOR AN I. VOTE THIS MORNING. THANK YOU SENATOR NEWMAN AND TODAY WE HAVE BOTH IN PERSON AS YOU MENTION MR DALE TERREL JOHNSON CEO WITH A CTA THANK YOU. MR JOHNSON. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS EARL JOHNSON THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER THE ORANGE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY. WE'RE HERE TODAY AS A SPONSOR OF SB NINE FORTY TWO. BUT CITY AS WELL AS TRANSIT AGENCIES NATION A STATE WIDE RECEIVE LOW CARBON TRANSIT OPERATIONS PROGRAM FUNDING AS YOU HEARD KNOWN AS LC TOP. MANUALLY ON A FORMAL BASIS AND FOR A CTA THAT'S INCLUDED. AND PROVIDED AT A KEY SOURCE OF FUNDING TO SUPPORT NEW AND EXPANDED BUS OR RAIL SERVICE. WHICH HAS INCLUDED INITIAL USE OF THESE FUNDS FOR REDUCED OR FREE TRANSIT FARE PILOT PROGRAMS WITHIN OUR COUNTY. SAMPLE LC TOP IS BEEN USED BY OCC FOR COLLEGE PASS PROGRAM PARTNERING WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO PROVIDE SIGNIFICANTLY DISCOUNTED FARE PASSES TO STUDENTS. AND MOST RECENTLY WE'VE USED OUR SHARE OF LC TOP FUNDS TO FUND OR USE RIDE FREE PROGRAM. AS A PROMOTIONAL PASS THAT ALLOWS YOUTHS AGE EIGHTEEN UNDER TO WRITE ALL ORANGE COUNTY FIXED ROUTE BUSES FOR FREE. THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL WE HAVE NEARLY SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND TOTAL BOARDINGS. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PROGRAM IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND THE NUMBER OF UNIQUE YOUTH WRITERS HAS CONTINUED TO INCREASE. THE YOUTH RIDE FREE PROGRAMS A KEY PART OF THE STRATEGY TO IMPROVE MOBILITY OPTIONS REDUCE CONGESTION. AND REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WITHIN ORANGE COUNTY. IN ADDITION IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN BRINGING RIDERSHIP LEVELS BACK WHAT WE HAD PRIOR TO THE KOBE PANDEMIC. DUE TO THE SUCCESS THE- CITY BOARD OF DIRECTORS DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY VOTED TO MAKE THIS PROGRAM PERMANENT AND EXPANDED TO INCLUDE. PARA TRANSIT RIDERS AS WELL THAT ARE ALSO EIGHTEEN AND UNDER. IN ADDITION- WITH IN TAKING THIS ACTION OUR BOARD IDENTIFIED LC TOP FUNDING IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE WE CAN KEEP THE PROGRAM IN PLACE. UNFORTUNATELY AS YOU'VE HEARD THAT INITIAL PILOT PROGRAM QUALIFIED TO USE LC TOP FUNDING. BUT IT CANNOT BE USED TO FUND THE PROGRAM LONG TERM REGARDLESS OF ITS SUCCESS. SB NINE FORTY TWO WILL CLARIFY THE ONGOING USE OF LC TOP FUNDING FOR THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS AUTHORIZED. ALLOWING TRANS AGENCY SUCH AS A CTA TO SUSTAIN OUR CURRENT PROGRAMS. AGENCIES WILL STILL BE REQUIRED TO REPORT ON METRICS ASSOCIATE WITH THE PAST PROGRAMS. AND DEMONSTRATE CONSISTENCY WITH LC TOP STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS IN THE INITIAL ALLOCATION REQUEST. WITHOUT A COMPLETE MY PRESENTATION AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR I. VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER JOHNSON. NEXT TO MY MISTER MICHAEL PIMENTEL WITH CALIFORNIA TRANSIT ASSOCIATION WELCOME. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF MICHAEL PIMENTEL EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA TRANSIT ASSOCIATION ASSOCIATION THE ASSOCIATION. IS A PROUD CO SPONSOR OF SB NINE FOUR TWO. I JOIN YOU TODAY ON BEHALF OF MY MORE THAN EIGHTY FIVE TRANSFER REALLY AGENCY MEMBERS TO VOICE OUR STRONG SUPPORT. FOR SB NINE FOURTEEN AND RESPECTFULLY URGE I VOTE ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL. AS YOU HEARD SENATOR NEWMAN AND MR JOHNSON DESCRIBE THIS BILL WOULD AUTHORIZE CALIFORNIA TRANSIT AGENCIES. TO CONTINUOUSLY DIRECTOR LOW CARBON TRANSFORMATION PROGRAM FUNDS. THE FAIR OR REDUCED TRANSIT FARE PROGRAMS. NOW THESE PROGRAMS HAVE PROVEN TO BE QUITE POPULAR- BUT WE HAVE FOUND STATEWIDE THE TRANSIT AGENCIES OFTEN HAVE DIFFICULTY SUSTAINING. THESE PROGRAMS BECAUSE THEY INHERENTLY REDUCE REVENUES COLLECTED AT THE FARE BOX. NOW THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS HAVE OVERCOME THIS CHALLENGE BY IDENTIFYING LONG TERM FUNDING SUPPORT. INCLUDING FROM FOR EXAMPLE UNIVERSITY LEVEL ASSESSMENTS IN COUNTY GENERAL FUNDS. NO S. B. NINE FOUR TWO WOULD CREATE AN ADDITIONAL PATHWAY TO LONG TERM FUNDING SUPPORT FOR THESE PROGRAMS. BY MY EARLY MODIFYING THE EXISTING LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM. WHICH WAS DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE OPERATIONAL INVESTMENTS THAT REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AND DELIVER BENEFITS TO DISADVANTAGED AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. IF PASSED WE BELIEVE THIS WILL NOT ONLY BENEFIT TRANSIT AGENCIES AND COMMUNITIES WITH PROGRAMS IN PLACE TODAY. BUT ALSO TRANSIT AGENCIES AND COMMUNITIES ON THE VERGE OF CREATING SUCH PROGRAMS. IN DOING SO THIS BILL WOULD SUPPORT OUR INDUSTRY AND OUR EFFORTS TO EXPAND ACCESS TO OUR SERVICES. WHILE ALSO PROTECTING THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF OUR TRANSIT AGENCIES WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THIS MORNING AND ENCOURAGE. PRIVATE HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR PATEL. WE'VE CONCLUDED OUR LEAD WITNESS TESTIMONY AND NOW WE MOVE ON TO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WHO'D LIKE TO TESTIFY IN THE GALLERY. IN SUPPORT OF SB NINE FOUR TWO.

THANK YOU MR MODERATOR WE'VE CONCLUDED OUR TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF SB NINE FOUR TWO WILL MOVE OVER TO- ANY OPPOSITION AND LOOKS LIKE YOU DO NOT HAVE ANY LEAD OPPOSITION- IN TERMS OF WITNESSES SO WE'LL MOVE TO THE GALLERY IS THERE ANYONE WHO'D LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO SB NINE FORTY TWO. THE NUN WILL MOVE ON TO. YES MISTER MODERATOR PLEASE ANYBODY IN A BID ON THE TELECONFERENCE LINE THAT LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO SB NINE FORTY TWO POLICE. SORRY ABOUT THAT I JUMPED THE GUN A LITTLE BIT YOU ARE OKAY THE FRONT. THANK YOU I PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO TO TESTIFY. IN OPPOSITION TO SB NINETY FOUR TO. YEAH MAN I'M SURE NOBODY'S QUEUING UP AT THIS TIME OKAY GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH I WOULD CONCLUDE BOTH SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION SO WE'LL TAKE IT TO BACK TO MEMBERS ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. REGARDING SB NINE FORTY TWO SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I DO THINK THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT BILL THE WAY I SEE IT IT'S A WIN WIN. SITUATION PROGRAMS LIKE THESE ARE NEEDED TO IMPROVE MOBILITY BUT SPECIFICALLY IT ALSO HELPS DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND- AND THAT'S GREAT AND WHILE HELPING THE ENVIRONMENT SO. NOT ONLY DO I WANT TO MOVE THE BILL BUT I WANT TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR I THINK THAT DURING THESE DIFFICULT TIMES WHERE- YOU KNOW A LOT OF FOLKS CAN'T AFFORD THE GAS NOR. COULD THEY AFFORD TO- TO PAY FOR A CAR THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO GET PEOPLE TO INCREASE RIDERSHIP CELL WITH THAT I WOULD MOVE THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO SENATOR AKOWSKI. MADAM CHAIR THIS. THE STAFF REPORT INDICATES THAT THIS PROGRAM THE 5% THAT COMES AT A CAP AND TRADE. WOULD BE WAS. EIGHTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR FISCAL. TWENTY TWENTY ONE- THEN. I'M DOING CALCULATIONS WE'VE HAD THREE QUARTERS OF THE- OF THE CAP AND TRADE AUCTIONS FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND WE'RE ALREADY AT THREE POINT FOUR BILLION. M. WITHIN MINUTES HIS PAINTED OTHER BILLION IN THE- MAY AUCTION. MY CALCULATION IS THAT MONEY THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR TRANSIT AGENCIES MILLION DOLLARS. THIS IS QUITE A BIT MORE THAN EIGHTY TWO MILLION. I GUESS THE QUESTION IS LAW MAYBE. THE EITHER THE AUTHOR. OR MR PIMENTEL WHAT OTHER AGENCIES MIGHT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS CONTINUING. APPROPRIATION AT THE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR LEVEL THAT ARE TAKING PLACE. THERE ARE- TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS POPULAR. AND- POPULAR PROGRAM PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE SHRINKING PASSENGER- PARTICIPATION ON OUR TRANSITS GIVEN THE PART THAT MAKES- THEY THINK THE LOW NUMBERS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE- OUR COVERT RELATED BUT I'M CURIOUS IF THEY SEE THE CHANGES THAT ARE PROPOSED IN SB NINE FOUR TWO AS IGNITING OTHER. OF THE- TRANSLATIONS HE SAID ARE PARTICIPATING IN THAT THEY WOULD PARTICIPATE. AND WHAT THAT MAY DO TO RIDERSHIP THANK YOU- SENATOR NEWMAN AND I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION SO YOU SAID THAT YOU KNOW THE GOAL OF THE BILL IS TO ELIMINATE SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS AGREED BARRIERS TO PARTICIPATION. LET ME PLEASE DEFER TO EITHER MR PIMENTEL OR MISTER JOHNSON- TO SPEAK ON HOW OTHER AGENCIES MIGHT ACCESS THESE FUNDS ABSOLUTELY SENATOR NEWMAN WE HAVE MR UP UNTIL LINED UP SO PLEASE MR THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO TO SENATOR WHITE HOUSE USE QUESTION I WOULD WANT TO NOTE. THAT WHILE THIS PROGRAM DOES RECEIVE 5% OF THE ONGOING APPROPRIATION FROM CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM EVERY AGENCY IN THE STATE DOES RECEIVE A FORMULA SHARE. INTO THERE IS A PUBLISHED NOTICE FROM CALTRANS THAT GOES OUT TO AGENCIES THAT DEFINES HOW MUCH FROM THIS PROGRAM THEY WILL RECEIVE AN AGENCIES ARE CHARGED WITH PUTTING FORWARD. PROPOSED INVESTMENTS THAT MEET THAT STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS IS THAT COULD BE INSTANCES OF ALLOWING AGENCIES TO ADVANCE THEIR FREE REDUCE TRANSIT FOR PROGRAMS COULD ALSO BE OTHER OPERATIONAL INVESTMENTS SIMPLY INCREASING SERVICE LEVELS FOR EXAMPLE. AND SO AGENCIES WILL MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON THE APPROPRIATIONS THAT ARE PROVIDED IN THEIR EXACT FORMULA SHARED A WE WOULD STIPULATE THAT WITH THIS. NEW FLEXIBILITY THAT IS PROPOSED IN SB NINE FOUR TWO MORE AGENCIES WILL BE INCLINED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH FAIR OR REDUCED TRANSFER PROGRAMS RECOGNIZING THAT THEY COULD- PURSUE THOSE PROGRAMS IN PERPETUITY WITHOUT THE THREAT OF A RECESSION. AND SO THAT I THINK IS AN EQUITABLE REALLY JUST ENCOURAGING THE INDUSTRY FORWARD ON THE ACCESS ISSUE- THAT'S PROVIDED BY THE SPILL OVER TO SPARK PASSES. THANK YOU MISTER PRIME INTEL AND I THINK- I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE ELSE QUEUED UP PROBABLY NOT. THE SENATOR NEWMAN ADD TO IT THANK YOU TO MUCH MIDDLE ELEVEN LET E ALSO THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE SOURCES- FORD TRANSIT AGENCIES TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES- THEY'RE VERY LIMITED. NUMBERS FOR THE USE OF TRANSCRIBER SO THAT THERE IN LIES THE BASIS. FOR THIS BILL- DIVIDED FLEXIBILITY IT YOU KNOW THANK YOU. TO BOTH OF THE WITNESSES- FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION- GRATEFUL TO SENATOR RUBIO GLAD TO ADD YOU. AS A CO AUTHOR- BY EXTENDING AND EXPANDING LC TOP PROGRAMS S. B. NINE FOUR TO ADVANCE CALIFORNIA'S OVERALL GOALS FOR REDUCING GREENHOUSE GASES WHILE. SUPPORTING INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO EXPANDING MASS TRANSIT OPTIONS PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO WILL BENEFIT THE MOST- AND PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO IN THE AFTERMATH OF ENDEMIC ARE MOST INNEED WITH THAT. I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR NEWMAN I SEE NO OTHER MIKES UP BUT- WE DO HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR RUBIO AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU AS WELL FOR THIS A BILL I KNOW THAT- CTA HAS BEEN A GREAT JOB IN MAKING INCREDIBLE. BUSINESS CASE BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY ENSURING THAT THERE'S RIDERSHIP- AFTER THESE PROTRACTED THAT THE PROGRAMS THAT THEY INSTITUTED HAVE.

TO IMPROVE THE RESILIENCE OF ROADS BRIDGES TRANSIT ANOTHER CRITICAL TRANSPORTATION ASSETS THAT ARE AT RISK FROM CLIMATE CHANGE. IT ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS ARE COMMUNITIES ARE SEEING THE IMPACTS OF AN ALREADY CHANGING CLIMATE. FROM FLOODING TO EXTREME CLIMATE FUELED NATURAL HAZARDS ARE THREATENING THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF OUR CONSTITUENTS- THERE ARE CONSTITUENTS DEPEND ON TO GET TO WORK GO TO THE DOCTOR AND MOVE GOODS IN AND OUT OF OUR PORTS. IT MIGHT IN SENATOR MCGUIRE'S DISTRICT STATE ROUTE THIRTY SEVEN IS ONE OF THOSE LIFELINES THAT THE NEXT TWENTY THIRTY YEARS IS EXPECTED TO BE UNDER WATER. YES THREE TEN FORTY NINE LAYS THE GROUNDWORK FOR MAJOR TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS BY DEDICATING RESOURCES TO START IMPLEMENTING HIGH PRIORITY RESILIENCE IMPROVEMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED THROUGH ROBUST. MULTI STAKEHOLDER PLANNING. AT THE SAME TIME MANY COMMUNITIES MOST IMPACTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE ALSO LACKED THE FUNDS TO ENGAGE IN THE CRITICAL PLANNING WORK NEEDED TO PROTECT VULNERABLE TRANSPORTATION ASSETS AS WELL AS ADJACENT COMMUNITIES. S. B. TEN FORTY NINE INCLUDES DEDICATED RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THIS PLANNING. RESILIENCY WILL TAKE MANY FORMS ACROSS THE STATE AS WE LOOK TO ADDRESS NOT ONLY C. LEVEL RISE BUT WILDFIRES MUDSLIDES AND OTHER CLIMATE FUELED HAZARDS. NO MATTER THE SPECIFIC NEEDS IN A GIVEN COMMUNITY ONE THING IS CLEAR CALIFORNIA WILL REQUIRE LARGE SCALE INVESTMENT TO PROTECT OUR TRANSPORTATION ASSETS AND MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES RESILIENT TO CLIMATE CHANGE.

HI I'M GOOD MORNING I'M GEORGE AGAIN DOORMEN I'M AT THE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION WE ARE THE TRANSPORTATION PLANNING FINANCING AND COORDINATING AGENCY FOR THE NINE COUNTY SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. I WE'RE SPONSORING SB TEN FORTY NINE WHICH WOULD FOR THE FIRST TIME CREATE A DEDICATED RELIABLE FUN SOURCE FOR CALIFORNIA. THE DOCTOR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE AND SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES TO THE ALREADY CHANGING CLIMATE. THIS BILL WOULD DIRECT THE CTC TO DEDICATE A PORTION OF THE STATE'S THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL HIGHWAY FUNDING. THROUGH THE NEW TRANSPORTATION RESILIENCE PROGRAM I WOULD CREATE A FRAMEWORK FOR STRATEGICALLY PLANNING FOR AND BUILDING RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE. SO COUPLE KEY POINTS- FIRST THE BILL WOULD PROVIDE IMMEDIATE RESOURCES TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTING A PRESSING ADAPTATION PRIORITIES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE ROBUST MULTI STAKEHOLDER RESILIENCE PLANNING WORK THAT'S COMMENCED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. FROM THE STATE ROUTE THIRTY SEVEN RECENTLY QUARTER PROGRAM TO THE MYRIAD OF S. U. S. SENATE BILL ONE FUNDED ADAPTATION PLANS- THERE ARE A WIDE RANGE OF THESE PLANNING ROBUST MULTI STAKEHOLDER RESILIENCE PLANS THAT AGAIN HAVE BEEN I'M GOING AND HAVE BEEN ADOPTED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE BILL WOULD ALSO PROVIDE DIRECTION TO THE CD TO DIRECT FUNDING TO PROTECT HIGH PRIORITY VULNERABLE TRANSPORTATION ASSETS AS DEFINED IN THE BILL. THAT AND THAT WOULD ALSO HELP REDUCE RISK FOR VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN PART TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT. AT THE SAME TIME MANY OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT AS THE SENATOR SAID THAT ARE MOST IMPACTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE. ARE REALLY IN DESPERATE NEED OF FUNDS TO ENGAGE IN THE CRITICAL PLANNING WORK UP FRONT. THAT'S NEEDED TO IDENTIFY ADAPTATION NEEDS AND TO BEGIN FLESHING OUT SOLUTIONS THAT NOT ONLY PROTECT THE VULNERABLE TRANSPORTATION ASSETS. BUT ALSO THE ADJACENT COMMUNITIES. AND AGAIN NOT TO MENTION THE CAPITAL FUNDS TO CONSTRUCT THOSE PROJECTS. THAT'S% WHY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT I SPEAK TEN FORTY NINE INCLUDES DEDICATED RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THE PLANNING. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM TO BE FUNDED FROM RECURRING FEDERAL FORMULA DOLLARS THAT COME ITH A HIGH DEGREE OF CERTAINTY. THOSE ONGOING PLANNING RESOURCES CAN HELP T. UP A PROJECT PIPELINE. SO BEFORE I CLOSE I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO REFLECT ON HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR STRONG STATE LEADERSHIP AND DIRECTING REGIONS AND OTHERS ON THE GROUND TO BEGIN WRAPPING OUR ARMS AROUND THIS ENORMOUS AND REALLY PRESSING NEED- BUT ONE THAT WE'VE BEEN PUTTING OFF FOR QUITE A WHILE BECAUSE OF. THAT MANY MORE IMMEDIATE ISSUES AT HAND. THE INFLUX OF RESOURCES FROM THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE BILL ON THE HEELS OF THE HISTORIC SP ONE INVESTMENT REALLY DOES CREATE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO DEDICATE RESOURCES TO BEGIN TO TACKLE THIS MUCH NEEDED- DOWN PAYMENT ON RESILIENCE. THANKS THANK YOU MR MAN. NEXT WE'LL MOVE ON TO MISS SUSAN SMITH WITH THE SCTA THANK YOU MISS SMITH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SUZANNE SMITH EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CINEMA COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY AND THE CINEMA COUNTY REGIONAL CLIMATE PROTECTION AUTHORITY. OUR WORK IS REALLY AT THE INTERSECTION ALITY OF TRANSPORTATION AND CLIMATE AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WERE SO EXCITED AND PLEASED TO SUPPORT SB TEN FORTY NINE. THE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT AND JOBS ACT REALLY PROVIDES A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE TO ADDRESS RESILIENCE AS WELL AS OUR OTHER PRESSING TRANSPORTATION NEEDS. AT THREE TEN FORTY NINE FURTHER PROVIDES FURTHER OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE OUR PARTNERS IN THE COMMUNITY IN ASSESSING AND IDENTIFYING WHERE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS ARE MOST CRITICALLY IMPACTED BY THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. BY ALLOCATING A SMALL PORTION OF THE OVERALL I. I. J. MONEY TO THE CDC EXPECT TO SEE THE BEST AND MOST CRITICAL PROJECTS RISE TO THE TOP THROUGH A VERY. TRANSPARENT AND PUBLIC PROCESS. WE WILL BE ABLE TO ENGAGE WITH BOTH TRADITIONAL PARTNERS AS WELL AS NONTRADITIONAL PARTNERS SUCH AS ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS WHO ARE ACTIVE IN THE FIELD WORKING ON THE EFFECTS OF THINGS LIKE SEA LEVEL RISE. THAT STILL RISE. AND THAT WILL HELP US FIND WAYS TO DELIVER PROJECTS INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS MORE CREATIVELY AND WITH CO BENEFITS FOR BOTH ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION. AND ADDRESSING THE THAT'S TEN FORTY NINE PUTS THE STATE IN A POSITION TO LEVERAGE FURTHER FEDERAL FUNDS AS WELL AS LOCAL SOURCES. TO GET THESE KEY INFRASTRUCTURE RESILIENCE PROJECTS OUT ON THE STREET QUICKLY. BY BOLSTERING PARTNERSHIPS TO ADDRESS RESILIENCE NEEDS WE WILL BE ABLE TO SHOWCASE HOW STATES CAN AND SHOULD TACKLE THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE ON OUR BUILT AND NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. AND WE'RE PLEASED TO SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS SMITH. WE'VE CONCLUDED- YOUR LEAD WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF SB TEN FORTY NINE SO MOVE ON TO THE GALLERY ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE TO.

MEDICARE NOBODY IS KILLING US OKAY THANK YOU SO IT CONCLUDED BOTH SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION WILL TAKE IT BACK TO MEMBERS FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SENATOR RICK OWSKI- MANAGER AT THE END OF A PAGE FOR THE STAFF REPORT- SUGGESTS THAT WE MAY WANT TO LOOK AT CRITERIA FOR- CHOOSING THE ELIGIBLE PROJECTS AND IN WHAT HOW WE WOULD PRIORITIZE THAT WORKS I KNOW IN OTHER DISCUSSIONS WE'RE LOOKING AT NATURE BASED- RESOLUTIONS THIS SORT OF TO GIVE A PRIORITY. IF WE'RE LOOKING AT THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IN GENERAL WHERE WOULD YOU GO TO THOSE NATURE BREEZE- ALTERNATIVES- THERE'S NOT MUCH IN THE BILL AS THE STAFF REPORT PUTS OUT SO I WAS WONDERING IF THE AUTHOR- ADVOCATES- CAN CONTACT- COMMENT ON THAT. IN PARTICULAR WITH THE QUESTION ALSO RAISE VERSUS THE MONEY COMING IN FOR STATE STREET'S VERSUS LOCAL STREETS AND HELP THAT. CONUNDRUM WILL BE ADDRESSED OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR MCCASKEY SENATOR DODD WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND YEAH IT JUST IT AT LIKE ONE OF MY- EXPERTS TO- TO OPINE ON THIS. I'D THAT THAT WAS A SUGGESTION THAT WAS MADE THE STAFF REPORT I JUST FELT LIKE THAT MADE SENSE AND I THINK THERE WAS. THERE WAS CERTAINLY NO OPPOSITION TO DOING THAT WOULD ULTIMATELY AT THE END. OF HOPEFULLY RESULT IN A BETTER PRODUCT BUT IF THEY'VE GOT ANYTHING. MORE TO SAY UP ABOVE I'D BE HAPPY HERE ABSOLUTELY I BELIEVE THE- CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION WILL ALSO BE A WEIGHING IN ON THIS AS WELL THAT WILL KICK IT OFF TO MISSOURI AND I JUST IF YOU'D LIKE TO ADD ANYTHING ELSE. YEAH SO THE WAY THAT THE BILL STRUCTURE THE PRIORITIZATION AT THIS POINT IS THAT- REQUIRES THAT THE CTC AT. DIRECT RESOURCES TO PROJECT RESOURCES TO THE TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS MOST HIGH PRIORITY VULNERABLE ASSETS. AND IN MAKING THAT DETERMINATION IT DIRECTS THE COMMISSION TO CONSIDER. THE DEGREE OF RISK FOR RECURRING DAMAGE- ASSET FAILURE DUE TO CLIMATE THREATS. ON IT SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIES THAT FOR PROJECTS ON THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM THE COMMISSION SHALL CONSULT THE DEPARTMENT REALLY ROBUST ADAPTATION PRIORITIZATION WORK. AND THERE'S ALREADY BEEN UNDERTAKEN. AND THEN- SO THE SECOND PRIORITIZATION COMPONENT IS THAT. THEY CONSIDER THE BENEFITS OF THE PROJECTS TO PRESERVING OR ENHANCING REGIONAL OR STATEWIDE MOBILITY ECONOMY GOODS MOVEMENT SAFETY. AND OTHER BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH PROTECTING THE ASSETS. AND THEN THIRDLY IT DIRECTS AT PRIVATIZATION FOR PROJECTS THAT. BENEFIT PURPOSE SORRY BENEFITS OF THE PROJECT TO REDUCE PRESERVING OR PROTECTING ADJACENT COMMUNITIES AND THE ENVIRONMENT AND OTHER CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. SO THAT'S THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TIER ONE PRIORITIZATION. AND THEN YOU KNOW IN ADDITION IT. REQUIRES THE CDC TO GIVE EXTRA CREDIT IF YOU WOULD TO AT PROJECTS THAT. ALSO HELP ADVANCE OTHER STATE. PRIORITIES AND STATE GOALS INCLUDING REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS- PROMOTING SYSTEM RESILIENCE AND INCLUDING THE USE OF NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE. AND HELPING TO REDUCE CLIMATE RISKS FOR VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. THAT ARE IN THE VICINITY OF THE PROJECT. MAN CHARGED I WAS JUST THAT I COMMITTEE AND THE AUTHOR YOU KNOW THE- THE LEGISLATURE HAS A RICH HISTORY OF HUNTING RESPONSIBILITY TO THE AIRPORT- PUNTING RESPONSIBILITY THAT PVC OR PUNTING RESPONSIBILITY THAT. THE ENERGY COMMISSION TO SORT OF COME UP WITH THAT AND WE'VE BEEN CRITICIZED OF NOT GIVING ANOTHER DIRECTION AND- WE HAVE. WE HAVE CLIMATE. GOALS THAT WE WANT TO MAKE THE COMMUNITY RESILIENCE AND THEN IF A PIECE OF THAT IS THE HIGHWAY THAT THE ROADS AND SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO HAVE THE RIGHT HAND LEFT HAND TALKING BECAUSE- SOME OF THOSE. I'M SUGGESTING THAT SOMETIMES WE MIGHT HAVE TO ABANDON THE ROADS ARE RE ROUTE OR ROAD IN ORDER TO GET A GREETER. CLIMATE ADAPTATION PROJECT FOR SEA LEVEL RISE- FOR FLOODING THAT THE CALTRANS NCTC HAS SORT OF BEEN OUT THERE. THAT'S OUR JOB IS TO MAINTAIN THE ROADS YOU KNOW KEEP THE ROADS OPEN SO JUST THIS IS THIS IS AN INVITATION WITH THE BILL TO DO. A DEEPER DIVE ON THOSE THINGS AND THEN THEY MAKE SURE THAT AT LEAST WE CREATE A RECORD HERE THAT CTC AFTER LISTENING THAT THIS IS NOT JUST. YOU KNOW SHOULD BUILD. FOR YEARS AND EVERY ROSE TO THE FLAME DOESN'T MAKE IT SOMETIMES IT MAY MEETING AND AN ALTERNATIVE DESIGN THAT'S A MUCH BIGGER. BENEFIT FOR THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE FOR- FLOODING OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE ABSOLUTELY CENTER BY CAL SKI AND- AGREED AND WE TALK TO THE AUTHOR ABOUT THAT I KNOW HE HE UNDERSTANDS THAT THE CRITERIA FOR PRIORITIZATION IS IMPORTANT. WE'RE LUCKY TO ALSO HAVE ONE OF OUR CTC COMMISSIONERS HERE IN THE SENATE A SENATOR NEWMAN SO WE CAN START LOBBYING HIM TOMORROW. MANY OF THESE. ITEMS ALL ALL JOKING ASIDE I KNOW THAT- SENATOR DODD ALONG WITH HIS LEAD WITNESSES ARE ARE DEFINITELY- GOING TO BE ON TOP OF THIS THIS ISSUE ABSOLUTELY AND WE SHOULD. WEIGH IN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT. I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER MAKES UP A SENATOR DOT WOULD YOU LIKE AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE AT THE SPECS WE ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT AT THIS TIME AS P. TEN NINETEEN FORTY NINE TO HAVE A MOTION. ON AS BETWEEN TEN FORTY NINE SENATOR NEWMAN. OKAY THANK YOU SOME OF BY SENATOR NEWMAN. AND MR CHIEF CONSULTANT CAN YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ON SP TEN FOR NINE THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. CENTERS GONZALEZ HI. THE DOLLARS I BET. HI EIGHT HI ELLEN. SUCH A LETTER. ARCHULETA HI BECKER. PATES CORTESE I. DALI DOLLY I THOUGHT MELINDA'S I MEANT. NEWMAN NEWMAN I RUBIO. RUBIO HIGH SKINNER. HI WHITE HOUSE K. BY KELSEY I WILL TWELVE VOTES- SO LOOKS LIKE IT HAS ENOUGH TO GET OUT BUT WILL ENSURE THAT ITS ON CALL THANK YOU SENATOR DODD AND YOU HAVE YOUR NEXT BILL UP WHICH IS S. B. TEN FIFTY PLEASE PRESENT THANK YOU THANKS AGAIN MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- SP TEN FIFTY WOULD AUTHORIZE TOLLING ON STATE ROUTE THIRTY SEVEN GOVERNED BY THE BAY AREA INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING AUTHORITY. EVA IS THE ACRONYM THIS IS A CRITICAL STEP TOWARD PROVIDING THE NECESSARY REVENUE TO IMPROVE RESILIENCY THIS VITAL TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE FROM SEA LEVEL RISE AND FLOODING WHILE ALSO DEALING WITH CONGESTION ENVIRONMENTAL HANDS ENHANCEMENTS TRANSIT IN ACTIVE OTHER ACTIVE MODES OF TRANSPORTATION. IT'S THE MAJOR CORRIDOR EXTENDING FROM U. S. ONE OH ONE THE MOTTO THE INTERSTATE EIGHTY IN VALLEJO IT IS HERS VITAL CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE COUNTIES OF MARIN NAPA SONOMA AND SOLANO IN MY DISTRICT. YES SIR THIRTY SEVEN IS UNIQUE CORRIDOR WITH LONG STRETCHES OF LOW LYING ROAD SURROUNDED BY ECOLOGICALLY RICH WETLANDS. AT THE EDGE OF THE SAN PABLO BAY NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE MAKING IT PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO FLOODING AND SEA LEVEL RISE. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE ROAD FLOODED FOR OVER A MONTH. IN OVER A WEEK IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. IT HAS SOME OF THE WORST CONGESTION IN THE REGION IMPACTING COMMUTERS VISITORS IN FREIGHT MOVEMENT SEVEN DAYS A WEEK IT HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED BY CALTRANS IS ONE OF OUR MOST AT RISK. TRANSPORTATION ASSETS. RECENT REPORTS BY CALTRANS- ALSO NOTED THAT IT COULD BE PERMANENTLY INUNDATED AS SOON AS TWENTY FORTY. ESTABLISHING A TOLL ROAD AUTHORITY IS CRITICALLY CRITICAL COMPONENT TO PROVIDE PART OF THE REVENUE NEEDED TO SUSTAIN THIS IMPORTANT TRANSPORTATION ARTERY REVENUE WILL INCLUDE AN INTERIM IN OLDHAM IT PROJECTS AS WELL AS ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION AND ADAPTIVE IMPROVEMENTS. MEMBERS THIS IS A MASSIVE PROJECT HE HAD A VERY EXPENSIVE ONE AT THAT HE WILL TAKE MULTIPLE FUNDING SOURCES TO COMPLETE. WHAT TOLLS ALONE CANNOT MEET THE NEEDS OF THIS PROJECT THEY ARE A VITAL SOURCE OF LOCAL MATCHING FUNDS THAT WILL INCREASE THE PROJECT'S COMPETITIVENESS FOR ADDITIONAL STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS. LASTLY I'D LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE CHEERS CONCERNS ABOUT EQUITY IN THE IMPACTS OF TOLLS ON LOW INCOME DRIVERS I SHARE THESE CONCERNS AFTER ALL THESE ARE MY CONSTITUENTS. THAT WILL BE USING THE ROAD MORE THAN EVERYONE ELSE AND THAT'S WHY I INCLUDED PROVISIONS FOR DISCOUNTS FOR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS IN THE FORCE SURROUNDING COUNTIES. MOREOVER AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD I WILL BE ADDING LANGUAGE TO EXTEND THE DISCOUNT THE EIGHTY LOW INCOME DRIVER WITH A FAST TRACK. TO FURTHER ADDRESS THIS CONCERN. I HAVE TWO WITNESSES WITH ME TODAY TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT. THEY ARE REBECCA LONG ON BEHALF OF THE BEST BALL TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION AND SUZANNE SMITH FROM THE CINEMA COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY. THANK YOU SENATOR DODD WILL START WITH RESPECT ALONG WITH MTC THANK YOU AND WELCOME. GOOD MORNING TERROR GONZALEZ BY SURVEYS AND MEMBERS MY NAME'S ROCK ALONG AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATION AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS AT MTC. SP TEN FIFTY WILL HELP GENERATE FUNDS FOR A MOBILITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT ON A HIGHLY CONGESTED STRETCH OF STATE ROAD THIRTY SEVEN BETWEEN VALLEJO AND SEARS POINT THAT CONSISTS OF A SINGLE LANE IN EACH DIRECTION AND CAN TAKE DRIVERS MORE THAN AN HOUR AND A HALF TO TRAVEL WHICH SHOULD TAKE A LITTLE OVER TWENTY MINUTES HOME FROM WORK. THIS DELAY IMPOSES A MAJOR COST ON CURRENT MOTORISTS IN THE FORM OF WASTED TIME AND FUEL WHILE STUCK IN TRAFFIC. BY ADDING TOOLS TO THE CORRIDOR THE PROJECT NOT ONLY HELPS TO GENERATE MATCHING FUNDS FOR THIS MOBILITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT. IT ALSO HELPS TO LIMIT THE GROWTH IN VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE RESULT FROM ADDING JUST A REGULAR GENERAL PURPOSE LANES. AT THE SAME TIME BYOFFERING A 50% TOLL DISCOUNT TO CARPOOLS ALONG WITH A WITH A RELIABLE TRANSIT OPTION THE PROJECT WILL ENABLE MORE PEOPLE PER HOUR TO TRAVEL THROUGH THE CORRIDOR. THE BILL ALSO BREAKS NEW POLICY GROUNDS AS SENATOR DODGES SHARED REQUIRING A TOLL DISCOUNT FOR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS TO HELP OFFSET THE DISPERSION DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT OF THE TOLLS. AS NOTED BY SENATOR DODD ANOTHER URGENT GOAL OF SP TEN FIFTY EAST RIVER PROVIDE MATCHING FUNDS TO SUPPORT THE QUARTERS LONG TERM RESILIENCE. IN THE FACE OF SEA LEVEL RISE WHICH THREATENS THE ROADWAY WITHIN THE NEXT EIGHTEEN TO THIRTY YEARS. WELL THE MOBILITY PROJECT IS ON TRACK TO BEGIN CONSTRUCTION IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THE ALTERNATE PROJECT WILL TAKE LONGER TO DESIGN CONDUCT ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND MOST IMPORTANTLY. ANNOUNCED THE FUNDS FOR PROJECTS WITH AN ESTIMATED COST OF OVER FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. WITH S. B. TEN FIFTY A PORTION OF THE TOLL FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE TO BEGIN THAT WORK. SO THAT THE ULTIMATE PROJECT CAN GAIN CRITICAL MOMENTUM. NOW IS A UNIQUE MOMENT IN THE FEDERAL FUNDING LANDSCAPE WHERE CONGRESS HAS RECENTLY PROVIDED FUNDS TRANSPORTATION RESILIENCE. SOME OF THOSE FUNDS WILL BE COMPETITIVE GRANTS SELECTED BY USDOT. STATE ROUTE THIRTY SEVEN WILL FACE SOME STIFF OMPETITION AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL AND ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO COMPETE IS BY DEMONSTRATING THAT YOU HAVE SKIN IN THE GAME. AND BY THAT I MEAN MATCHING FUNDS. IN SUMMARY S. B. TEN FIFTY WILL HELP FUND NEAR TERM MOBILITY IMPROVEMENTS THAT WILL FACILITATE TRANSIT AND CARPOOLING ON A ROADWAY WHERE NONE OF THIS IS A VIABLE OPTION TODAY. ALONG WITH THE LONG TERM RESILIENCE OF ONE OF THE BAY AREA'S VITAL EAST WEST COMMUTE AND GOODS MOVEMENT CORRIDORS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS AND I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS LONG NEXT MOVE ON TO SUZANNE SMITH WITH A C. T. EIGHT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SUZANNE SMITH EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CINEMA COUNTY TRANSPORTATION OF AUTHORITY- WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF SB TEN FIFTY THERE IS NO TIME TO WASTE WHEN IT COMES TO ADDRESSING CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS AT RISK FROM CLIMATE CHANGE. HIGHWAY THIRTY SEVEN IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA IS THE POSTER CHILD PROJECT WHEN IT COMES TO A CRITICAL COURT OR- IN IMMINENT PERIL FROM SEA LEVEL RISE. GIVEN OUR TOPOGRAPHY WE ARE VERY LIMITED OPTIONS FOR EAST WEST CONNECTIVITY IN THE NORTH BAY AND HIGHWAY THIRTY SEVEN IS THE KILLING FOR THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE AND GOODS. PLUS IT SERVES AS AN IT HAS SERVED AS AN EVACUATION ROUTE DURING WILDFIRES. AND AS AN ALTERNATIVE ROUTE WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS TO THE RICHMOND SAN RAFAEL BRIDGE WITHOUT HIGHWAY THIRTY SEVEN WERE FRANKLY IN BIG TROUBLE. RIGHT NOW EVEN WITH PANDEMIC TRAFFIC LEVELS THE DELAY FOR COMMUTERS IS NINETY MINUTES WHAT SHOULD BE A FORTY MINUTE ROUND TRIP FROM INDIA AND IS NOW IN EXCESS OF TWO HOURS. THAT IS AN IMPACT TO PEOPLE'S LIVES EVERY DAY AS WELL AS THEIR WELL BEING NOT TO MENTION THE COST OF AN IDLING VEHICLE WITH TODAY'S FUEL PRICES. S. B. TEN FIFTY WILL HELP US DELIVER IMPROVEMENTS QUICKLY BY PROVIDING A LOCAL MATCH TO STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS. AND ENSURING THE CORRIDOR WILL HAVE ONGOING FUNDS TO SUPPORT TRANSIT AND DEVELOPING THE ULTIMATE RESILIENCE PROJECT THAT WILL GET THE COURT ARE OUT OF HARM'S WAY. WHILE ALSO RESTORING CRITICAL WETLANDS AND HABITAT. PRICE IN THE CORRIDOR HAS HIS ROOTS THE ORIGINAL HIGHWAY WAS A TOLL ROAD. PLUS IT IS IN KEEPING WITH STATE REQUIREMENTS TO REDUCE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND PROVIDE TRANSIT OPTIONS. WE NEED THOSE CARPOOL LANES AND TRANSIT OPTIONS A. S. A. P. WE NEED TO LOOK AT DOING PROJECTS DIFFERENTLY MEGA PROJECTS LIKE THIS MUST HAVEAS MANY TOOLS AS POSSIBLE TO ENSURE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE DELIVERY. IT AT THE SAME TIME WE RECOGNIZE THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS ALSO HAPPEN IN PHASES. THAT'S OUR APPROACH AT S. B. TEN FIFTY IS A VITAL PIECE OF THE STRATEGY. THANK YOU.

CITY UPON CITY UPON CITY- IN CALIFORNIA A REPORTING BACK TO ALL OF US THAT- SOME OF THE PEOPLE WITH THE DRIVE IN THE CENTER SECTION ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND. CAUSING PROBLEMS BECAUSE THE NOISE- THIS IS A WAY THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN WORK WITH THE CITY'S WORK WITH THE COMMUNITIES AND DO IT FAIRLY AND EQUITABLY BECAUSE IT'S A SOUND TECHNOLOGY THAT IS DETERMINING IF SOMEONE HAS VIOLATED THE LAW. NOT AN OFFICER HIMSELF OR HERSELF YOU TERMINATE IF YOU VIOLATE THE LAW IT IS THE TECHNOLOGY THERE IS THE FAIRNESS THERE IS EQUALITY AND CONSEQUENTLY IT ADDRESSES THE ISSUES THAT SOME OF THE MUNICIPALITIES HAVE TODAY. SO I STRONGLY URGE AND I VOTE AND I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL AND ASKED TO BE A CO AUTHOR THANK YOU. YOU HAVE A MOTION ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM. COMMITTEE BOTH ARE UNDETERMINED SOMEONE WHO REPRESENTS A NUMBER OF THE COASTAL COMMUNITIES MENTIONED INCLUDING HUNTING INVASION PORT BEACH AND LAGUNA BEACH- I KNOW THAT THIS IS A VEXING AND GROWING PROBLEM THAT AS OUR WITNESSES THAT TESTIFIED ARTICULATELY- TOO EASY SOMETHING THAT. IMPACT QUALITY OF LIFE IT HAS DETRIMENTAL IMPACTS ON THE WILDLIFE SANCTUARIES THAT BORDER A LOT OF THESE. AREAS ON THE P. C. H. I. AND IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT PROBLEM TO TRY TO ENFORCE AGAINST SO- I SUPPORT THIS BILL- I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR AT THE- APPROPRIATE TIME. AND- WOULD MOVE THE BILL. YOU DO HAVE A MOTION- FINISH MY COFFEE. BUT SO I AM. I WOULD SAY I THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION IS DECISION ON THE PRIVACY CONCERNS AND HOW THIS INFORMATION IS GOING TO BE. USED FOR LEGITIMATE WITH THAT SAID I LIKE THE MOVEMENT OF THIS BILL GOING INTO A PILOT PROGRAM. VERSES AS IT WAS ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED I GUESS THE QUESTION FOR THE CHAIR- IS. YOU KNOW IS THIS. IS THIS IS SIMPLE- FIX A TICKET THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET. OR DO WE WANT BASIS GONNA BE USED AS A YU KNOW A FRACTION THAT- OR THAT GOES ONTO THE COUNTS AGAINST THEIR INSURANCE. ON THAT AND DIDN'T. THE NOISE VIOLATIONS. THE GOOD QUESTION SENATOR GONZALEZ DID YOU HEAR THAT SENATORS QUESTION I DID THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR MCCASKEY AT THIS TIME WHAT WE'VE- ADDRESSING THE AMENDMENT. IS THE FIRST PENALTY. BASICALLY COULD BE. A WAVE TO- AN IT IS THIS IS THIS CLARIFIES THAT THE FOR NOTICE OF VIOLATION WILL CARRY NO PENALTY AND WHEN WILL INSTEAD BE UNNOTICED WHICH PERMITS AN OFFENDER TO REMEDY THE ISSUE ANY SUBSEQUENT WILL BE A- AN ADMINISTRATIVE VIOLATION IF THAT CITY DOES HAVE A DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION HOWEVER IF THEY DON'T HAVE A DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION- IT WOULD DIFFER. MOSTLY TO THE FOLKS THAT ARE WITHIN THAT CITY THAT- ADMINISTER TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS WHICH COULD BE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND AT THAT POINT IT COULD BE AT- A CITATION WITH THAT WITHIN THAT DEPARTMENT SO THAT SHOULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE CLEARER- ON BEHALF OF THE AUTHOR'S WELL. THANK YOU. ANY OTHERS YEAH. YOU'RE NOT SENATOR DODD YOU'RE JUST STRETCHING I THINK. HE YEAH OKAY AND I DON'T SEE ANY ARE I AM I'M GOING TO LAY OFF ON THE BILL TODAY I KNOW AND IT IS A MAJOR PROBLEM AND I REPRESENT MANY COASTAL CITIES AND CERTAINLY ON THE FREEWAY THAT RUNS ALONG IT'S ACTUALLY P. C. H. BUT I THINK THERE'S A FEW MORE QUESTIONS THAT I NEED ANSWERED BEFORE- I CAN BE SUPPORTIVE SO I WILL LAY OFF TODAY BUT TOMORROW WE DO HAVE A MOTION OH. OH I'M SORRY IF A LENDER FINANCE HIGHLANDER I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING LATE TO THE PROBLEM- PUTTING MY MAKE UP- I DO HAVE A QUESTION IS SENATOR GONZALEZ IS ABLE TO ANSWER IT I KNOW IT IS NOT YOUR BILL BUT- WHAT I HAVE BEEN HERE IS THAT. I IT. IT'S C. REQUIRES LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IMPLEMENTING THIS PROGRAM TO CONSIDER A PERSON'S ABILITY TO PAY THE PENALTY AND ALLOW PAYMENT OF THE PENALTY IN INSTALLMENTS OR DEFERRED PAYMENT METHOD PERSON PROVIDES EVIDENCE THAT THEIR- AND UNABLE TO PAY IT IN FULL SO- I GUESS. IF THEY'RE NOT ABLE. TO PAY THE FINE- I'M JUST NOT SURE HOW THAT WORKS IS YOU KNOW I MEAN IS THAT WHERE'S THE ENFORCEMENT PART ARE WORSE THAN. DEFERRING ARTISTIC IF YOU CAN ANSWER. SURE I'LL TRY MY BEST BUT- AGAIN I'LL JUST REITERATE- ON THE FIRST VIOLATION REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY OR NOT THE FIRST VIOLATION WOULD JUST BE WOULD BE WAIVED AS ALMOST LIKE A WARNING TO THAT THAT THE DRIVER THAT THIS OCCURRED. I WILL CARRY OUT THIS WITH THIS IS PRETTY NEW TECHNOLOGY SO- IF THERE RE SORT OF DISCREPANCIES BECAUSE THIS IS IN THE FIRST GENERATION OF TECHNOLOGY THEN THAT WOULD ALLOW SOME SORT OF- REPRIEVE FOR THAT VIOLATION BUT THE SUBSEQUENT THAT WOULD BE A DIFF ANOTHER QUESTION WE HAVE TO DIG INTO IN TERMS OF. HOW THE JURISDICTION IS WILLING TO WAIT EVEN TO WHAT POINT- AND SO. WHO WHAT QUALIFIES AS LOW INCOME A LOT OF THOSE QUESTIONS THAT WOULD NEED TO BE ANSWERED SO I WILL. WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ENSURING THAT WE GET THAT THOSE ARE SOLIDIFIED. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT I JUST THIS IS REMINISCENT OF- ISSUES THAT WE'VE HAD WITH RED LIGHT CAMERAS IN CITIES BEING SUED OVER THE USE OF THOSE. WITH YOU KNOW PROBLEMS WITH THE CALIBRATION AND THEM WORKING PROPERLY AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE SAID THIS IS A BIT CONCERNING GIVEN THAT IT IS- A NEW TECHNOLOGY BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR US.

I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT. SENATE BILL ELEVEN ELEVEN. I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE CHAIRMAN OR COMMITTEE. AND HER STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ME TO IMPROVE THIS IMPORTANT BILL. THE RICK BEST SAFETY ACT. IS NAMED AFTER LONGTIME LEGISLATIVE STAFF AND LOBBYISTS. RODRICK RICK BEST WHO SADLY PASSED AWAY AFTER A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT WITH AN UNMARKED DUMPSTER. AND A VERY VERY CLOSE FRIEND MY CHIEF OF STAFF JOHN WILCOX. MAY HE REST IN PEACE. THIS NECESSARY SAFETY MEASURES WILL PROTECT THE LIVES OF EVERYONE ON OUR ROADWAYS. THIS COMMON SENSE MEASURE WILL REQUIRE LARGE TRASH ROUTE RECEPTACLES PLACED ON ROADWAYS AND CURBS THEY HAVE REFLECTIVE MARKINGS ON EACH SIDE. THIS MARKING IS SO VITAL TO SAFETY. WITHOUT REFLECTIVE MARKETING THESE TRASH RECEPTACLES OR INVISIBLE AT NIGHT. AND LIKELY TO CAUSE FURTHER ACCIDENTS AND EVEN DEATH. RICK WORK IN SACRAMENTO AS A LEGISLATIVE STAFFER AN ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVIST WHO WAS HIGHLY INVOLVED WITH CALIFORNIA'S RECYCLING MOVEMENT FOR MANY MANY YEARS AS A LEGISLATIVE STAFFER RICK HELP SHEPHERD THE DOZEN OF ENVIRONMENTAL BILLS THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY INCLUDING A. B. TWENTY TWO FOURTEEN WHICH PREVENTED. CREATION OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE DUMP IN THE BOBBY DEDRIC WARD VALLEY HE CONTRIBUTED A GREAT DEAL TO THIS GREAT BODY. HE LATER WENT ON TO BECOME THE POLICY DIRECTOR FOR CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE WHERE HE WAS MOST KNOWN FOR TAKING ON COCA COLA MILLER BREWING COMPANY AND DOW ARGO SCIENCES. MEMBERS PUBLIC SAFETY AND KEEPING PEOPLE SAFE ON OUR STREETS IS ONE OF OUR BIGGEST PRIORITY. SENATE BILL ELEVEN ELEVEN IS AN IMPORTANT STEP. CALIFORNIA CAN TAKE TO IMPROVE OUR ROADWAYS FOR MOTORISTS AND BICYCLISTS ALIGHT. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT F PUBLIC HEALTH IN OUR STATE TOOK PLACE AT NIGHT. IN MANY FIFTIES TRASH DUMPERS AND ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION BETWEEN TWENTY EIGHT BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN AND TOTAL- CYCLISTS HAVE DIED. AND CALIFORNIA STREETS WITH AN AVERAGE OF A HUNDRED TWENTY NINE PEOPLE PER YEAR THE CYCLISTS MUST BE CONTINUED TO BE PROTECTED. LARGE TRASH RECEPTACLES PLACED ON ROADWAYS AND CURBS ARE VIRTUALLY IN VISIBLE. ON DARK STREETS AND THEY PRESENT A HAZARD TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. THE MAJORITY OF THE OF THEM ARE DARK COLORED OFTENTIMES WITH NO REFLECTIVE STRIPES UNLESS THE COMPANY HAS ADDED TO HIM AND SOME ARE TRYING TO DO IT NOW. AS WE KNOW RICK SCENARIO- THE DRIVER A BISON RIGHT IN THE LONG RUN AT NIGHT CAN POTENTIALLY RUN INTO ONE OF THESE FULL SPEED AND BECOME SERIOUSLY INJURED OR EVEN KILLED STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RETRO REFLECTIVE MARKETING TO ENHANCE VISIBILITY. IT IS THERE FOR A PURPOSE FURTHERMORE CALIFORNIA ALREADY UTILIZED A REFLECTIVE MARKETING ON OUR ROADS TRAFFIC SIGN LICENSE PLATE JUST TO NAME A FEW. S. P. ELEVEN ELEVEN SIX TO IMPROVE NIGHTTIME VISIBILITY ENABLING MORE REACTION TIME WHICH WILL RESULT IN SAFER ROADS FOR DRIVERS AND CYCLISTS AT NIGHT. IT IS AN IMPORTANT REASON THAT WE CONTINUE THE PUBLIC SAFETY THAT WE'RE SPEAKING HERE TONIGHT. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. VOTE. WITH ME TODAY I HAD TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS COREY- SELVES IT IS YELLOW. ON BEHALF OF THE THREE M. TRANSPORTATION SAFETY DIVISION.

OUT WITH ADDITIONAL TIME TO SEE- AND AVOID POTENTIAL HAZARDS- AS THE AUTHOR NOTED THERE ARE ALREADY ALREADY REQUIREMENTS. TRAFFIC SIGNS TRUCK TRAILERS RAILROAD CARS- HAVE RICHER REFLECTIVE PROPERTIES AND OTHER MARKINGS ARE REQUIRED- TO HAVE FLUORESCENT PROPERTIES- ADDING THIS REFLECTIVE REQUIREMENT- THESE TRASH RECEPTACLES- WOULD BE A CLEAR DEMONSTRATION OF OUR COMMITMENT TO ROADWAY SAFETY. AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. PHONE THANK YOU THANK YOU MR SOCIO- SO YOU.

OKAY THANK YOU MR MODERATOR SWEET CONCLUDED SUPPORT AN OPPOSITIONAL TAKE IT BACK TO MEMBERS FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON AS P. ELEVEN ELEVEN. SENATOR MELINDA'S. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- CENTER OR TO LET IT WHAT I. WHAT I'M I'M I'M CLEAR OF IN YOUR BILL IS- IT'S NOT SPECIFIC AS TO WHO WOULD- COLLECT THE FINE. I'M SORRY WHAT WHO WHO WOULD ACTUALLY WHO WOULD BE COLLECTING THE FINDING WELL LET ME POINT OUT THAT REMEMBER I'D MENTIONED THAT THE MUNICIPALITIES WOULD BE- FEEL WELCOME TO SEE THIS THEY'RE THE ONES THAT WOULD BE- IN CHARGE. OF IN THE IN THE COURSE OF THE INDUSTRY ITSELF- IS THERE'S NO OPPOSITION IT'S JUST THE EMPLOYMENT THE SAFETY ROLE AND I THINK IT'S- IT'S EASY EASY FOR US- THANK YOU AND I AND I UNDERSTAND THAT MY- MY QUESTION NOW IS. WHO WHO IS COLLECTING THAT FINE IF THE BUT SAY IT'S YOU KNOW WHATEVER WASTE HAULING COMPANY- IS LEASING THE TRASH RECEPTACLES AND THEY DON'T HAVE THOSE REFLECTIVE MARKINGS. THEN WHO COLLECTS THE O. LINE FROM THEM IT WOULD BE THE CITY IN QUESTION AND THIS IS ALL YOU WOULD. KEEP THAT MONEY THE CITY. THE CITY WOULD BE IN CHARGE AIR FORCE A AND THE FOLLOWING ARE VERY MINIMAL THE MONEY WITH ITS MORE OF A PUBLIC SAFETY KNOWLEDGE AND- BECAUSE THE FINDER. THE VERY FIRST OFFENSE IS A HUNDRED DOLLARS- SECOND IS FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN THE THIRD IS A THOUSAND RIGHT I JUST I DIDN'T SEE IN THE BILL I NOTICED WHERE YOU PULLED OUT THE PART. THAT REFERENCE ON THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND SO I DIDN'T SEE IN THERE THAT IT'S CLEAR THAT THE CITY. IS THE ENTITY THAT WOULD COLLECT THAT REVENUE IN KEEP IT AND WE WILL WORK WITH THAT TO CLARIFY THAT. BUT AGAIN IT'S JUST TO GET THE PROGRAM MOVING AND I THINK THAT- WE'RE NOT TRYING TO BE PUNITIVE TO THE INDUSTRY WE'RE JUST TRYING TO BRING THEM AROUND SO MANY CITIES OF AVAST FOR INDIA BY TO LISTEN. AND DRIVERS AT NIGHT IN RURAL AREAS ESPECIALLY. BE VERY DANGEROUS. AND I BELIEVE SENATOR ARCHER LETTER THAT WAS TAKEN OUT FROM THE BILL SO IT'S NOT- THERE'S NO- CLEARER- DEFINITION ON WHO WOULD ACTUALLY RECEIVE THE- VIOLATION OR- WAS RECEIVED THAT. ARE WHO WOULD ENFORCE AND RECEIVE THE REVENUE ON ON THE- VIOLATION. SO THAT COULD BE- DISCUSSED MOVING FORWARD IN THIS BILL AND I THINK THIS IS. NEXT GOING TO JUDICIARY SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE'S VOTE COULD BE TAKEN UP AT THAT POINT- THANK YOU SENATOR MELENDEZ AND SENATOR ARCHULETA ANY OTHER. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SENATOR BATES ARE YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR SENATOR ARCHULETA MY UNDERSTANDING IS- LET MANY CITIES HAVE FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS WITH WASTE HAULERS. WOULDN'T THAT BE SOMETHING THAT THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO- REQUIRE- WIND THEY NEGOTIATE THEIR THEIR- THEIR AGREEMENTS WITH CITIES THAT THESE PARTICULAR. REFLECTIVE TAPES WHATEVER THE USE FOR THE REFLECTIVE DEVICE BE INCLUDED. ON THEIR LARGE. DUMPSTERS OF THE LARGE CONTAINERS- THAT WAY THERE WOULD BE A WAY TO- ACTUALLY FOLLOW UP ON WHO DID IT. IT IT IT DID NOT DO IT. AND WHERE THE- PENALTIES LION AND THAT COULD REALLY BE VERY FOCUSED AT A LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL AND I THINK EASILY TRACKED DOWN THAT IF THE QUESTION. WAS PERHAPS THE SUGGESTION. YES I THAT EVERY THAT WE'RE A TO DO- WILL COME FORWARD WORKING WITH THE TRASH INDUSTRY MAKING SURE THAT- THAT WHATEVER. OWNERSHIP OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW EVERY CITY HAS A DIFFERENT COMPANY. AND FROM THE INVESTIGATIVE WORK WE'VE DONE THEY'RE ALL READY TO DO IT THEY JUST WANT TO. HEAR FROM US THAT- THE COMPULSION ARE PARTICIPATING IN A MENTORED EARLIER A FEW OF THEM ARE DOING IT. WE JUST GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WORK HAND IN HAND WITH THE CITY AND IT COULD BE A CITY SEAL COULD BE THE WRAPPING. BUT REFLECTIVE THINGS THAT ARE NECESSARY WILL BE SEEN AS THE AUTOMOBILE THE BICYCLIST APPROACHES. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. I'M NOT I'M GOING TO JUST A NOTE BOOK THIS MORNING THAT WORK WITH YOU ON A FEW IDEAS I FEEL IT'S A LITTLE MORE PRESCRIPTIVE. I THINK THAT WILL HELP THEN IT WILL ALSO HELP R. I THINK IN FOR CEMENT AND FOLLOW THROUGH ON THE PART OF OUR WASTE HAULERS. WHO ARE IN SUPPORT OF IT THAT IS A LITTLE VAGUE NOW. FOUND OUT OUT OR BE CHATTING WITH YOU AFTER VERY GOOD SENATOR BE WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT. THANK YOU VICE CHAIR BASED SENATOR NEWMAN. THANK YOU MANAGERS. GENERAL TWO AND A QUICK QUESTION- I NOTICED THAT. IN THE RELATED PREVIOUS LEGISLATION SECTION OF OUR HOUSE IS. EITHER YOU DANCE NUMBERS THIS BILL. NOT ONCE BUT TWICE BEFORE- SO KUDOS FOR EUROPE CONSISTENCY. ABOUT GEORGIA IN BRIEF WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE. BETWEEN THIS BILL IN THE PREVIOUS TWO- THIS PARTICULAR BILL IS ADDRESSING- THE SIGNAGE AND ONLY THE SIGNAGE WRAPPING. THAT'S IT IT IT DOESN'T. COVER ANYTHING ELSE ONLY REQUIRING THAT ALL THESE- DIFFERENT COMPANIES. ADHERE TO THE RULE. PLACE THE SIGNAGE AROUND YOUR TRASH BINS REFLECTIVE- SO THE MOTORIST AND CYCLIST COULD BE AWARE OF SEEING THAT IN THE EVENING HOURS OBVIOUSLY WHEN IT'S DARK IN THIS IS WHAT CAUSED THAT ONE ACCIDENT SO THIS IS TO PREVENT. FURTHER ACCIDENTS. AND SO THE INDUSTRY IS NOT. AGAINST IT WE'VE HAD NO NEGATIVE ON IT IT JUST IMPLEMENTING THE PLAN AND I THINK IT'LL IT'LL COME FULL CIRCLE WITHIN A SHORT TIME CHAIR. ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ON SB ELEVEN ELEVEN SEE NONE- CAN WE ENTERTAIN A MOTION FOR THE BILL PLEASE.
