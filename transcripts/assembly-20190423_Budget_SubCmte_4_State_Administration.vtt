LIMITS I HAVE NOT BEEN UPDATED

01:13:25.167 --> 01:13:27.136
SO MANY YEARS THAT WE CONTINUE

01:13:27.202 --> 01:13:28.670
TO EXPOSE THE SAME WORKERS.

01:13:28.737 --> 01:13:30.005
AND NEW WORKERS TO COME INTO THE

01:13:31.907 --> 01:13:33.242
THE CLAIM THAT AT ALL POSSIBLE

01:13:33.308 --> 01:13:35.444
TO EXPEDITE THE PROCESS TO BE

01:13:35.511 --> 01:13:36.879
ABLE TO LOWER THESE LIMITS.

01:13:36.945 --> 01:13:39.214

UNFORTUNATE SITUATION OF HAVING

01:13:43.819 --> 01:13:47.122
THESE DISASTERS FIRES WHERE THIS

01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:48.924
TYPE OF WORK ACTIVITY HAS BEEN.

01:13:48.991 --> 01:13:50.392
KEY TO THE TO THE CLEAN UP

01:13:50.459 --> 01:13:55.330
OPERATIONS OF OUR FIRES BOTH THE

01:13:55.397 --> 01:13:56.465
NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA --

01:13:56.532 --> 01:13:58.100
YOU FIND A LOT OF LEAD ABATEMENT

01:13:58.167 --> 01:13:59.635
WITHIN A VERY IS -- OLD

01:13:59.701 --> 01:13:59.935
BUILDINGS.

01:14:00.002 --> 01:14:01.403
THAT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE

01:14:01.470 --> 01:14:03.338
IN OUR COMPANIES ARE CONTRACTORS%

01:14:03.405 --> 01:14:05.407

EXPOSURE LIMITS BUT TO THE

01:14:06.975 --> 01:14:08.277
DEGREE THAT.

01:14:08.343 --> 01:14:09.845
UNTIL THEIR REDUCE WILL CONTINUE

01:14:09.912 --> 01:14:11.880
TO EXPOSE UNNECESSARY AMOUNT OF

01:14:11.947 --> 01:14:14.383
PEOPLE DUE TO THE LIMITS NOT

01:14:14.449 --> 01:14:14.616
BEING.

01:14:14.683 --> 01:14:15.717
UPDATED.

01:14:15.784 --> 01:14:17.920
AGAIN I I CERTAINLY RESPECT WITH

01:14:17.986 --> 01:14:19.521
THE DEPARTMENT HAS TO DO.

01:14:19.588 --> 01:14:21.023
BUT I'D REALLY WOULD INSIST THAT

01:14:21.089 --> 01:14:22.491
WHATEVER WE COULD POSSIBLY DO TO

01:14:22.558 --> 01:14:24.059
BE ABLE TO EXPEDITE THE PROCESS

01:14:24.126 --> 01:14:25.494
WOULD BE EXTREMELY.

01:14:25.561 --> 01:14:27.663
VERY MUCH APPRECIATIVE ON BEHALF

01:14:27.729 --> 01:14:32.034
OF ALL THESE WORDS IN THE STATE.

01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:33.969
SO IT WAS DISCUSSED TALKING

01:14:34.036 --> 01:14:35.904
ABOUT IS A DATE OF A NURSING A

01:14:35.971 --> 01:14:38.440
NEW DATE OF FEBRUARY FIRST.

01:14:38.507 --> 01:14:39.074
TWENTY TWENTY THAT'S TEN MONTHS

01:14:39.141 --> 01:14:39.975
AWAY.

01:14:40.042 --> 01:14:44.213
IS THAT REALISTIC.

01:14:44.279 --> 01:14:46.248
WE BELIEVE THAT -- FOR THE

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:49.585
COMPREHENSIVE STANDARD -- A DATA

01:14:49.651 --> 01:14:52.120
MAY TWENTY TWENTY WOULD BE

01:14:52.187 --> 01:14:54.356
REALISTIC AND WHEN I SAY

01:14:54.423 --> 01:14:56.525
COMPREHENSIVE STEP THAT STANDARD

01:14:56.592 --> 01:14:59.194
I I MEAN NOT JUST THE THE P. L.

01:14:59.261 --> 01:15:00.729
THE PERMISSIBLE PERMISSIBLE

01:15:00.796 --> 01:15:02.197
EXPOSURE LEVEL.

01:15:02.264 --> 01:15:03.632
BUT THE ENTIRE STANDARD

01:15:03.699 --> 01:15:06.468
INCLUDING THE ACTUAL LEVEL --

01:15:06.535 --> 01:15:08.003
WHICH IS THE SET THE THE

01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:09.872
STANDARD THAT TRIGGERS THE

01:15:09.938 --> 01:15:11.240
PROTECTIVE MEASURES.

01:15:11.306 --> 01:15:13.375
BOB BEFORE HARM OCCURS BECAUSE

01:15:13.442 --> 01:15:17.713
THE P. L. WORKS -- TO TO SET THE

01:15:17.779 --> 01:15:20.983
LINE FROM WHERE HARM WOULD OCCUR --

01:15:21.049 --> 01:15:22.851
BUT THE ACTUAL LEVEL IS THE ONE

01:15:22.918 --> 01:15:24.386
THAT TRIGGERS THE PROTECTIVE

01:15:24.453 --> 01:15:26.088
MEASURES AND THE STANDARD THAT

01:15:26.154 --> 01:15:27.489
THE DIVISION IS CURRENTLY

01:15:27.556 --> 01:15:33.362
WORKING ON AND AND WE HOPE -- TO

01:15:33.428 --> 01:15:35.564
TO TO SENT TO THE BOARD -- IN A

01:15:35.631 --> 01:15:40.569
IN IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS.

01:15:40.636 --> 01:15:42.571
HOW IS COMPREHENSIVE SO INC IT

01:15:42.638 --> 01:15:43.238
WOULD INCLUDE THE P. L. BUT IT

01:15:43.305 --> 01:15:45.040
ALSO WOULD INCLUDE THE ACTION

01:15:45.107 --> 01:15:45.908
LEVEL?

01:15:45.974 --> 01:15:48.076
AND OTHER STANDARDS AS WELL THAT

01:15:48.143 --> 01:15:54.516
MAKE THAT PROTECTION -- REAL.

01:15:54.583 --> 01:15:55.784
I GUESS MY ONLY CONCERN IS THAT

01:15:55.851 --> 01:15:57.452
IF IF IS THAT REASONABLE IS THAT

01:15:57.519 --> 01:15:59.454
REALISTIC IT'S BEEN AT THIS A

01:15:59.521 --> 01:16:00.989
LONG TIME COMING.

01:16:01.056 --> 01:16:04.259
AND I'M NOT A SCIENTIST BUT

01:16:04.326 --> 01:16:04.826
STILL WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH

01:16:04.893 --> 01:16:06.662
SOMETHING THAT'S OUT OF THE

01:16:06.728 --> 01:16:07.262
ORDINARY Là FOLKS HAVE DEALT

01:16:07.329 --> 01:16:07.896
WITH THERE'S A LOT OF

01:16:07.963 --> 01:16:09.965
INFORMATION OUT THERE SO.

01:16:10.032 --> 01:16:11.133
AND THIS ISN'T CUTTING EDGE

01:16:11.199 --> 01:16:11.433
[inaudible]

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:13.135
SCIENCE.

01:16:13.201 --> 01:16:16.004
IS BEING DONE ELSEWHERE SO.

01:16:16.071 --> 01:16:18.473
THIS IS A CONCERNS BEEN SO LONG.

01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:19.775
IT WILL REALLY HAPPEN IN TWENTY

01:16:19.841 --> 01:16:21.276
AT SOME POINT SO MUST BE HELD

01:16:21.343 --> 01:16:22.444
ACCOUNTABLE.

01:16:22.511 --> 01:16:24.079
AND TO ME LAST ME OCCURRED THREE

01:16:24.146 --> 01:16:26.882
YEARS AGO AND TO GET A REPORT IT

01:16:26.949 --> 01:16:29.418
TAKES THREE YEARS AGO REPORT --

01:16:29.484 --> 01:16:31.453
AFTER CALL B. S. ON THAT -- I

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.188
JUST I JUST NOT SURE WHERE IT

01:16:33.255 --> 01:16:34.556
GOT DROPPED AT THESE WORKERS ARE

01:16:34.623 --> 01:16:35.924
BEING EXPOSED LEVEL IT'S IT'S

01:16:35.991 --> 01:16:37.059
REAL.

01:16:37.125 --> 01:16:39.828
IT'S DANGEROUS -- IS IT IT'S

01:16:39.895 --> 01:16:41.830
IT'S UNACCEPTABLE THAT WE CAN'T

01:16:41.897 --> 01:16:43.765
GET IT DONE SOONER AND QUICKER

01:16:43.832 --> 01:16:46.168
STILL SOMEWHERE.

01:16:46.234 --> 01:16:47.836
IN MY OPINION AND LET'S GET

01:16:47.903 --> 01:16:49.805
MONTH SCIENTISTS -- BEEN

01:16:49.871 --> 01:16:50.872
DRAGGING OUR THE BALLS BEEN

01:16:50.939 --> 01:16:57.312
DROPPED SO -- THE QUESTION

01:16:57.379 --> 01:16:57.946
COMMITTEE WHICH LACKEY

01:16:58.013 --> 01:16:58.246
[inaudible]

01:16:58.313 --> 01:17:02.851
NO SIR.

01:17:02.918 --> 01:17:04.453
A THE GOAL IS TO HAVE THIS YEAR

01:17:04.519 --> 01:17:06.221
I I JUST LIKE TO ADD ONE MORE --

01:17:06.288 --> 01:17:08.623
BUT I THINK IT'S CERTAINLY

01:17:08.690 --> 01:17:09.524
RELEVANT.

01:17:09.591 --> 01:17:12.394
IS LONG AS THESE LEVELS ARE NOT

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:14.796
ADJUSTED.

01:17:14.863 --> 01:17:17.099
THE INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO IN

01:17:17.165 --> 01:17:19.401
MANY CASES.

01:17:19.468 --> 01:17:21.670
CONSIDER THIS TO BE.

01:17:21.737 --> 01:17:22.671
BECAUSE THEY COULD GO AHEAD AND

01:17:22.738 --> 01:17:24.373
WORK UNDERNEATH THESE LEVELS

01:17:24.439 --> 01:17:25.173
THAT HAVE BEEN.

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:27.576
AT THIS OVER SO HIGH FOR SO LONG.

01:17:27.642 --> 01:17:29.011
THE CONTINUE TO PERFORM THIS

01:17:29.077 --> 01:17:31.980
ABATEMENT.

01:17:32.047 --> 01:17:33.315
UP UNTIL THAT POINT TO GET THAT.

01:17:33.382 --> 01:17:34.983
THAT IS SO HIGH THAT THEY CAN

01:17:35.050 --> 01:17:37.019
BID ON IT FOR THE LACK OF THE

01:17:37.085 --> 01:17:38.420
IMPROPER LICENSE.

01:17:38.487 --> 01:17:39.855
IN OTHER WORDS FOR DEMOLITION

01:17:39.921 --> 01:17:41.223
TYPE WORK.

01:17:41.289 --> 01:17:42.257
THEY COULD GET AWAY WITH DO A

01:17:42.324 --> 01:17:43.492
LOT OF DEMOLITION WORK WITHOUT

01:17:43.558 --> 01:17:44.826
HAVING TO DO THE APPROPRIATE

01:17:44.893 --> 01:17:46.261
MEASURES.

01:17:46.328 --> 01:17:47.829
BECAUSE OF THE LEVELS IF THESE

01:17:47.896 --> 01:17:49.297
LEVELS DON'T COME DOWN THEY WERE

01:17:49.364 --> 01:17:50.799
EXPOSING KNOWING THE WORKERS

01:17:50.866 --> 01:17:51.433
WITH THE GENERAL POPULATION AT

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:52.868
LARGE.

01:17:52.934 --> 01:17:54.302
NOW ANY EMPLOYERS REFORM HIS

01:17:54.369 --> 01:17:55.904
TYPE OF WORK SORRY UNDERSTANDS

01:17:55.971 --> 01:17:57.339
WHAT IS REQUIRED TO BE ABLE TO

01:17:57.406 --> 01:17:59.207
PROTECT THE GENERAL POPULATION

01:17:59.274 --> 01:18:00.675
IN FACT IS BE PERFORMED.

01:18:00.742 --> 01:18:02.511
WELL PEOPLE AROUND.

01:18:02.577 --> 01:18:03.178
BUT THAT'S ANOTHER FACTOR REALLY

01:18:03.245 --> 01:18:04.746
CONSIDER AND THAT'S THE REASON I

01:18:04.813 --> 01:18:06.014
THINK THEY WERE SO.

01:18:06.081 --> 01:18:06.681
I THINK THAT THE PART WHATEVER

01:18:06.748 --> 01:18:08.483
EVERYTHING POSSIBLY DUE TO BE

01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:09.718
ABLE TO EXPEDITE THIS WOULD BE

01:18:09.785 --> 01:18:11.253
EXTREMELY APPRECIATED ONCE AGAIN.

01:18:11.319 --> 01:18:14.056
AND WHEN WERE THE LEVELS

01:18:14.122 --> 01:18:14.723
ESTABLISHED HOW LONG AGO.

01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:17.526
IN THE NINETIES.

01:18:17.592 --> 01:18:19.094
IT'S BEEN A WHILE [inaudible]

01:18:19.161 --> 01:18:21.430
S..

01:18:21.496 --> 01:18:21.997
WE'RE GOING OVER THE PUBLIC

01:18:22.064 --> 01:18:34.443
COMMENT.

01:18:34.509 --> 01:18:36.378
YEAH FOR THE AYE ARE UNRELATED.

01:18:36.445 --> 01:18:38.080
QUESTION -- CAN BRIGHTEN UP THE

01:18:38.146 --> 01:18:39.514
ON THE WAIT LIST FOR THE GARMENT

01:18:39.581 --> 01:18:54.229
RESTITUTION FUND.

01:18:54.296 --> 01:18:55.297

IS MY VOICE -- IS APPROXIMATELY.

01:19:11.046 --> 01:19:12.914
THREE HUNDRED OR SO CLAIMS --

01:19:12.981 --> 01:19:13.882
NOW WHEN I SAY THREE HUNDRED

01:19:13.949 --> 01:19:15.584
CLAIMS THESE ARE THREE HUNDRED

01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:17.819
CLAIMS FOR THE RESTITUTION FUND

01:19:17.886 --> 01:19:19.221
ITSELF.

01:19:19.287 --> 01:19:20.622
NOT THREE HUNDRED CLAIMS THAT

01:19:20.689 --> 01:19:23.058
ARE IN THE ENTIRE PIPELINE A

01:19:23.125 --> 01:19:25.026
PART OF THE PROCESS IS TO FIRST

THOUSAND PER CASE WORKER -- THE

01:26:08.596 --> 01:26:09.931
THE REASON THAT THAT MATTERS.

01:26:09.998 --> 01:26:13.868

AND SO -- BECAUSE THEY CANNOT

01:26:32.987 --> 01:26:34.722
MANAGE THE WORKLOAD -- THAT THEY

01:26:34.789 --> 01:26:37.525
