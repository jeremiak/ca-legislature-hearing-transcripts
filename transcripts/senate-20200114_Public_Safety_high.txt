THAT'S NOT ADEQUATE MEMBERS TO DO REAL COSTS ARE GOING TO HOLD OFF ON ROLL CALL. WE'RE GONNA START ON MAKES AN ANNOUNCEMENTS THIS IS THE FIRST TO A SESSION OF THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY FOR THIS TWENTY TWENTY YEAR. SB FIVE THREE SIX US SENATOR UMBERG'S HAS BEEN PULLED FROM TODAY'S AGENDA SB SEVEN TO THREE- JONES IS ON THE PROPOSED CONSENT CALENDAR. SB ONE SIX ONE IS BTES VOTE ONLY. AND THAT LEAVES US FOR BILLS TO DISCUSS AND AN AUTHOR HAS JUST WALKED INTO THE ROOM SO WE WILL START WITH SENATOR GALGIANI COME MONDAY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS SB THREE EIGHTY EIGHT REQUIRES LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO ADHERE TO EXTENSIVE REPORTING INVESTIGATIVE AND OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO MISSING PERSONS THAT ARE ALREADY PRESCRIBED IN STATE LAW. IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND THERE WERE TWO BILLS THAT WERE PRESCRIBED TO CONFORM WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITH REGARD TO STAB WISHING MISSING PERSONS DATABASES AND ALSO ESTABLISHING A MANNER IN WHICH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD BE ABLE TO. IDENTIFY PREVIOUSLY UNIDENTIFIED MISSING PERSONS THAT LAW WAS EXTENSIVE AND OVER TIME IT CHANGED IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN I AUTHORED SB TEN SIXTY SIX AND SB EIGHT FORTY SIX. TO AMONG OTHER THINGS INCLUDE MISSED RISK DAHLE AND THIS TO THAT PREVIOUSLY HAD ONLY MANDATED REQUIREMENTS WITH REGARD TO THE YOUNG PERSON. WE HAD AN OVERSIGHT AT THAT TIME WHERE THE ORIGINAL STATUTE IN TWO THOUSAND OUT OF LOW THERE IS A CHANCE TO EXEMPT THEMSELVES FROM THE LAW AND THAT WAS IN AND IT TO PROTECT RURAL COMMUNITIES THAT. WERE UNDER FUNDED AT THE TIME TWENTY YEARS HAVE SINCE PASSED AND WE HAVE RECOGNIZED THAT IT'S LONG OVERDUE TO ENSURE THAT ALL COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA REQUIRE THE SAME STATUTE WITH REGARD TO BOTH MISSING. YOUNG PERSON'S OLDER. IN ADULTS THIS. TEMPLATE UP DATE REQUIRE ALL TOWNIES STATE FOLLOW THE SAME LAW I RESPECTFULLY FOR RIVAL. THREE OF WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT QUESTIONS FROM MY COLLEAGUES. SENATOR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I AM JUST CURIOUS. CENTER GALGIANI WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIX HAVE WE- THE PROBLEM. YES WE HAVE ACTUALLY I'LL GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE THAT IT THAT EXISTS IN. IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IN MY DISTRICT WE HAD LONG TERM RECOVERY SAID FIVE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD GONE MISSING FROM EIGHTY FOUR EIGHTY FIVE AND NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT AND AT THE DIRECTION OF. A SERIAL KILLER- WHO WAS GIVING INFORMATION DIRECTING TO WEAR BODIES WERE BURIED THESE FIVE INDIVIDUALS WERE RECOVERED THERE WERE OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS WHO CAME FORWARD AT THE TIME WHO CLAIMED THAT THEY HAD HAD MISSING- LOVED ONES WHO'D GONE MISSING AND DURING THE TIME THESE TWO INDIVIDUALS FOR ACTIVE- SUCH EXAMPLE IS. A RED JEEP MEANING WHO WENT MISSING FROM CALAVERAS COUNTY AND WAS APPELLEE FRIENDS AND CO WORKERS WITH THE TO SEE TWO SUSPECTS HIS WIFE CAME FORWARD ON NATIONAL TELEVISION AND INDICATED THAT SHE BELIEVE HERSELF HER HEAD AND HER EX HUSBAND WAS ONE ITEMS. HE WAS NEVER EVEN WITH IT IS MISSING HE IS JUST ONE. OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT I MISSED A LOT OF- WE TRIED TO ADD INTO THE DATABASE. SAID NEVER IDENTIFIED TODAY AND IF AN INDIVIDUAL'S NEVER ENTERED INTO THE SYSTEM AND IF YOU NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE DNA TAKEN AND SUBMITTED TO STATE NATIONAL DATABASES THEN IF THERE IS EVER RECOVERY THERE IS NO ABILITY TO EVER IDENTIFY THAT INDIVIDUAL. SO WE'RE SIMPLY TRYING TO GIVE FAMILIES A BLIND THE BEST OPPORTUNITY POSSIBLE. AT IDENTIFICATION IN THE EVENT OF A RECOVERY. WILL NOT MAKE IT RETROACTIVE IGHT TO KNOW IT NO IT DOES NOT WE HAVE CONSIDERED THAT AND WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT THAT BUT THIS ONE DOES NOT. IN SOME CASES IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO GO RETRACTED BUT WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT GOING FORWARD ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT REPORTS EQUALLY. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY'RE OF WORLD COUNTY OR AN URBAN COUNTY AND SECONDLY WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT IN THE EVENT IN THE EVENT THAT A FAMILY MEMBER COMES FORWARD. YEARS LATER AFTER SOMEONE HAS GONE MISSING THAT THERE IS THE ABILITY TO REPORT AND ENSURE THAT DNA IS SPEAKING IN THE EVENT RECOVERY SO ARE ANY COUNTIES- OR- POLICE DEPARTMENTS NOT FILING REPORTS CURRENTLY. AT THE ALREADY. UP WE KNOW WE KNOW WE KNOW THAT IN THE PAST THERE HAVE BEEN COUNTIES THAT HAVE NOT REPORTED. ON THESE TWO INDIVIDUALS WESLEY SHERMAN TIME LEARN HERZOG WERE OPERATING BETWEEN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. AND SOUND LOOKING CALAVERAS COUNTY IS THE BAY AREA IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WENT MISSING FROM CALAVERAS COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE DURING THE TIME THE FIFTEEN YEARS THAT THEY WERE ACTIVE. THERE WAS ONE INDIVIDUAL ROGER SHALL TOWN WHO WENT MISSING DURING THAT TIME THERE WERE MANY MORE. BUT THAT'S BEFORE THESE BILLS. WERE ENACTED SO WE'D BE FULLY SAID AFTER THOSE INCIDENTS WE SHOULD. REQUIRE REPORTING BUT- LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CAN OPT OUT BUT NO JURISDICTIONS HAVE OPTED OUT. IN OUR MANDATING THAT THEY CAN OPT OUT I'M JUST. NO LOCAL LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVEN'T ALWAYS FOLLOWED THE LINE AND BECAUSE THEY HAVE OFTEN THEMSELVES OUT I CAN'T LIST EXACTLY WHICH ONES THERE ARE. BUT IF YOU START LOOKING AT SOME OF THE WORLD COUNTIES AMADOR CALAVERAS YOU'LL SEE THAT THAT. THEY THEY'RE ABSENT MISSING PERSON RECORDS FROM OLDER YEARS AND EVEN IF YOU LOOK AND NOT ALL ARE REPORTING EQUALLY THERE ARE COUNTIES WHO REPORT THEM MISSING PERSONS ON FACEBOOK SITES. FACEBOOK AN AYE BIBLE CALAVERAS IS ONE OF THOSE BUT THE EIGHT TWILA ME I BELIEVE IS ANOTHER THAT REPORTS THERE'S ON A FACEBOOK SITE THAT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD AS AN ADDITION BUT IT DOESN'T DO ANY GOOD IF A FAMILY MEMBER HAS GONE MISSING FROM A COUNTY AND THEY ARE NOT IN THE STATE WIDE AND NATIONAL DATABASES AND THEIR FAMILY HAS NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE DNA AND THEIR BODY IS FOUND SOMEWHERE ELSE. AND THEY'RE NEVER IDENTIFIED. Q. I DON'T SEE OPPOSITION BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWERING AND I APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTION JUST TRYING TO I KNOW THIS.

THAT MAY IMPEDE THE BILL LATER WE'LL SEE- THE ISSUE OF MAKING SURE WE GET SUCH INFORMATION AND DATA BASES. WAS COMPELLING FOR ME SO HI BUT BASICALLY- I REALIZE THERE ARE. YOU KNOW YOU CAN HAVE- THERE'S DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO ADD HIM TO ACT ON THE PARTICULAR- CIRCUMSTANCE THAT OUR COLLEAGUE SENATOR GOLD YANNI'S PUTTING BEFORE US BUT- I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL BUT OF COURSE MEMBERS WILL OBVIOUSLY NEED TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS BUT DO WE HAVE A MOTION ON. RIGHT WE HAVE MOTION. ALL RIGHT LET'S DO A ROLL CALL ON. SB THREE EIGHT EIGHT. QUESTION IS THE PASTOR APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER AYE SKINNER AYE MORLOCK.

ALRIGHT OKAY I'M READY I'LL I'LL GET IT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I. IT IS EARLY THANK YOU THANK YOU. AT E. S. THANK YOU FOR YOUR GRACIOUSNESS BY AND I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT THIS BILL. SB SEVEN TEN ON BEHALF SENATOR BATES- WHICH ALLEVIATES THE UNINTENDED IN- DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCES OF RECENT CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM BILLS. WITH THE FOLLOWING FOR CHANGES FIRST IT WOULD REINSTATE THE DNA COLLECTION OF CERTAIN CRIMES THAT WERE REDUCED. TO MISDEMEANORS IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN PROP FORTY SEVEN RE CLASSIFIED SEVERAL THESE FELONY OFFENSES AS MR MEANER. I IN ADDITION A PROP FORTY SEVEN UP AND TOOK AWAY RIGHTS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TO COLLECT THE ANY SAMPLES. FROM THOSE WHO OFFENSES WERE ONCE CONSIDERED FAMILIES AND SINCE THE PASSAGE OF PROP FORTY SEVEN INDIAN A DATABASE IS ALREADY EXPERIENCE A DIP IN EFFECTIVENESS- SB SEVEN TEN WILL RESTORE DNA COLLECTION FOR CERTAIN CRIMES IT REQUIRED DNA. COLLECTION BEFORE THEIR RE CLASSIFICATION AS MISDEMEANOR UNDER PROP FORTY SOUTH. SEVEN SECOND SB TEN WILL RE CLASSIFY SPECIFIC VIOLENT CRIMES AS VIOLENT FAN- FELONIES TO ENSURE INDIVIDUALS CONVICTED OF THESE CRIMES ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR EARLY RELEASE. OP PROP FIFTY SEVEN'S PROPONENTS PROMISE IT INDIVIDUALS CONVICTED OF A VIOLENT CRIMES SUCH AS RAPE OF AN UNCONSCIOUS PERSON IN IT BEING. OF THE CHILD WOULD NOT BE RELEASED FROM PRISON HOWEVER SEVERAL COURT CASES APPROVING AT THESE- VIOLENT OFFENDERS AGAINST CHILDREN CAN BE RELEASED EARLY IN TO OUR NEIGHBORHOODS MOST RECENTLY A FELON CONVICTED OF MURDER MOLESTATION OF AN ELEVEN YEAR OLD. AND RAPE OF A PREGNANT MINOR IS NOW AS A LOW VALUABLE FOR EARLY RELEASE ON THE PROP FIFTY SEVEN. SB SEVEN TEN RE CLASSIFIES A VIOLENT CRIMES WRONGFULLY CLASSIFIED AS NON VIOLENT INDIVIDUALS CONVICTED OF SUCH VIOLENT CRIMES WILL NO LONGER BE ELIGIBLE FOR EARLY RELEASE THIRD SB SEVEN TEN WILL EXPAND- PROLIA OVERSIGHT IN STRENGTH AND PENALTIES FOR PAROLE. VIOLATIONS I DO THE CHANGES MADE BY AB ONE ON NINE AND TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN PAROLE. DECISIONS ARE BASED SOLELY ON AN INMATE'S COMMITMENT- OFFENSE AND WILL NOT FACTOR IN PASS OFFENSES THAT MAY HAVE BEEN SERIOUS OR VIOLENT THE RESULT IN CHANGING AB ONE ONLINE AS ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THE MURDER OF WHAT YOUR POLICE OFFICER KEITH BOYER- LAW OFFICERS MURDER VIOLATED HIS PAROLE. IN HAD BEEN FLASHING CAR SERRATED SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE SB TEN WILL REQUIRE THE BORDER PEARL TO CONSIDER AN INMATE'S ENTIRE CRIMINAL HISTORY HISTORY INCLUDING ALL CURRENT PAST CONVICTIONS. LASTLY SB SEVEN TEN RESTORE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR SEVERAL THIEVES SERIAL THIEVES- PROP FORTY SEVEN CHANGE THE THRESHOLD FROM- FOR FIFTY FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS TO NINE HUNDRED FIFTY FOURTH UP TO BE CONSIDERED A FELONY. THIS MEANS AS LONG AS INDIVIDUAL STILLS LESS THAN NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS WORTH OF MERCHANDISE THEY WILL ONLY BE CHARGED WITH A MISDEMEANOR NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES THEY COMMIT THIS OFFENSE. SINCE THIS CHANGE WITH PROP FORTY SEVEN CALIFORNIA HAS SEEN AN EXPLOSION OF REPEAT PETTY THEFT OFFENDERS- AND AN INABILITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TO PROSECUTE THESE CRIMES EFFECTIVELY LAST YEAR HOME THE PEOPLE WORK WITH THE STATE LEGISLATURE YOU TALK TO ADDRESS. SERIAL THAT IN AS A RESULT ARSENE DECREASED AS- IN STOLEN MERCHANDISE SB TEN SIX TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE WITH REPEAT PETTY OFFENDERS AND IN A- FELONY PURSER OF THAT. THE KEEPING CALIFORNIA SAFE ACT SB SEVEN TEN WILL FIX THESE FOUR MAIN PROBLEMS CREATED BY. LAWS THAT HAVE- THREATEN THE PUBLIC SAFETY OF CALIFORNIANS AND THEIR FAMILIES FROM VIOLENT CRIMINALS. THANK YOU FOR. LISTENING IN YOUR TIME IN WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. NOW ARE SEEMS TO BE ONE. BY MEN NOT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR DON CAP KEY ON BEHALF OF CRIME VICTIMS UNITED OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT THE- WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. YOU MAY PROCEED. YEAR. STARTED AGAIN. GOOD MORNING AND HAPPY NEW YEAR MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- WITH GREAT RESPECT TO THE AUTHOR AND TO THE CO AUTHORS- CPA IS OPPOSED TO THIS BILL IT'S AN ATTEMPT TO REPEAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORMS PASSED BY A MAJORITY OF THE VOTERS OF THE STATE. ALL OF THE THINGS THAT ARE LISTED IN THIS BILL WHICH CASTS A VERY VERY WIDE NET- ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT THE INCREASED PENALTIES DO NOT MAKE US SAFER. ALL OF THIS WOULD DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT RACIAL MINORITIES. ALL OF THIS WOULD MOVE US BACKWARD AND NOT FORWARD TO MAKE US A SAFE AND JUSTICE JUST SOCIETY. I DISAGREE WITH THE DIP INEFFECTIVENESS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IN TERMS OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORMS THAT HAVE PASSED- AND WE DO NOT- HAVE STATISTICS THAT SHOW ANY EXPLOSION. IN REPEAT PETTY THEFT AS A PRACTITIONER FORTY YEARS AN INDIGENT DEFENSE THE PETTY THIEVES THAT I DEALT WITH WERE. 95% PEOPLE WHO WERE- DRUG AND ALCOHOL. AFFECTED IN MANY MANY WAYS AND THAT'S WHO WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON AND NOT FOCUSED ON PUTTING THEM IN PRISON FOCUSED ON CHARGING THEM WITH FELONIES AND- TAKING THEIR DNA AND PUTTING THEM INTO DATABASES THAT DO NOT HELP. MAKE CALIFORNIA A SAFER THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS. MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBER HAPPY NEW YEAR- MIKE A DOCTOR OFF ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA ALSO IN OPPOSITION TO SB SEVEN TEN I WOULD ECHO THE CONCERNS RAISED BY MY COLLEAGUE- AND ALSO JUST ADD THAT THESE THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL HAVE BEEN BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE- MULTIPLE TIMES IN THIS COMMITTEE HAS REJECTED THESE PROVISIONS THE LEGISLATURE HAS REJECTED VARIOUS ITERATIONS OF THIS SPELL- IN BOTH HOUSES- AND SO IT'S UNFORTUNATE TO SEE THIS BROUGHT BACK AGAIN- AGAIN AT A TIME WHERE CRIME RATES IN CALIFORNIA ARE AT HISTORIC LOWS THE VIOLENT CRIME RATE- IS AT ITS THIRD LOWEST- IN RECORDED HISTORY- AND AT A TIME MORE CALIFORNIA IS RELEASED TRYING TO SERVE AS A LEADER IN PROTECTING VULNERABLE. COMMUNITIES I THE BILL IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND MY COLLEAGUE SAID- UNDERMINES THE WILL OF THE VOTERS WHO OVERWHELMINGLY PASSED BOTH PROP FORTY SEVEN AND PROP FIFTY SEVEN- THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THESE REFORMS I'M HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL IN FACT THE EVIDENCE- IS MUCH TO THE CONTRARY- AND SO IS REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL. THE DIMARTINO THE CALIFORNIANS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE WE ARE OPPOSED. I SPAWNING IS WITH CUT FIFTY WE'RE OPPOSED. ONE FIFTY WE ARE POST. KEN OLIVER WITH ELLIS PC WE OPPOSE. RIGHT ANY REMAINING RIGHT SO BEFORE I LOOK TO MY COLLEAGUE SO ME MAKE A COMMENT. ON AT. YES WE HEAR FROM THE SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE THIS REFRAIN THAT- OUR POLICIES THAT EITHER ARE VOTERS HAVE APPROVED OR THE LEGISLATURE HAS APPROVED ARE MAKING CALIFORNIANS LESS SAFE MEANWHILE WE HAVE. GOOD GOOD DATA THAT SHOWS THAT CRIME HAS CONTINUOUSLY SPECIALLY VIOLENT CRIME PRIMARILY VIOLENT CRIME HAS BEEN IN A DOWNWARD TRENDING GOING DOWN EACH YEAR FOR THE PAST AT LEAST TEN YEARS. NOW SAYING REPEATING AGAIN AND AGAIN THE UNICORN ISRAEL DOES NOT MAKE UNICORN REAL THIRTY EATING AGAIN AND AGAIN THAT CRIME IS- VIOLENT CRIME IS UP IN CALIFORNIA OR THAT POLICIES THAT ARE VOTERS HAVE SUPPORTED. IS CONTRIBUTING TO THEIR- TO A TO A TO A HORRIBLE CRISIS OF SAFETY IS DOES NOT MAKE IT REAL AND- WHAT I. WHAT I RESPECT ABOUT CALIFORNIA VOTERS IS THEY SO FAR HAVE NOT FALLEN FOR THE UNICORN ARGUMENT AND I HOPE THAT THEY CONTINUE NOT TO FALL FOR THE UNICORN ARGUMENT. ON I WANT TO JUST POINT OUT THAT THIS BILL I'M DOES PROVISIONS OF BOTH PROP FORTY SEVEN AM PROP FIFTY SEVEN. AND THEN THE OTHER ASPECT ON THE DNA WELL I AM A VERY STRONG ADVOCATE FOR OUR USE OF DNA IN OUR COLLECTION OF DNA. IN A SET OF CRIMES BECAUSE OF ITS VERY IMPORTANT EFFICACY IN TERMS OF OUR- FINDING THE PERPETRATOR- IDENTIFYING AND SECURING. APPROPRIATE CHARGES ON THE PERPETRATOR WE ALSO KNOW NOW THAT LIKE ANY OF OUR TECHNOLOGIES THERE ARE DOWN SIDES TO THAT DNA ON. TO THAT NEED FOR EXAMPLE. WE ARE NOW HAVE EVIDENCE THAT A PERSON THAT RECEIVED A BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT. CAN. CHAU DNA OF THE PERSON THAT THEY RECEIVE THE BONE MARROW TRANSPORT TRANSPLANT FROM SO THEY COULD THAT COULD THEN PUT HEM AT RISK OF COURSE OF BEING CONSIDERED A SUSPECT IN A CRIME FOR WHICH THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO IT NOW WE WOULD HOPE THAT ALL OF OUR OTHER INVESTIGATORY TOOLS WOULD PROTECT SUCH INDIVIDUALS BUT AS WE KNOW IT IS NOT INFREQUENT FOR PEOPLE TO BE WRONGFULLY CHARGED IN WRONGFULLY CONVICTED SO I THINK TO MOVE TO THE COLLECTION OF DNA FOR MISDEMEANORS WHEN THERE'S A LITTLE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE- COMMITTING OF SUCH MISDEMEANORS AND THEN THE POSSIBILITY OF COMMITTING VIOLENT FELONIES. THIS DOES NOT MAKE SENSE AT THIS POINT SO I WILL BE VOTING NO ON THIS BILL- BUT WELCOME ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR MY COLLEAGUES CENTER LARA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MAYBE AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE. I DON'T KNOW BUT TO UNICORN ARGUMENT BUT- I CERTAINLY HAVE FRIENDS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT INCLUDING MY COUNTY SHERIFF IT'S REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT AB ONE ON NINE PROP 47-57 IN THE IMPACTS ON ON THE COUNTY OF ORANGE- SO- I DIDN'T COME PREPARED FOR A BIG DEBATE BUT- CERTAINLY. AS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR AT THE TIME CERTAINLY SAW. A LOT OF THINGS FIRST HAND SO I WOULD- APPRECIATE THAT IF I COULD MOVE THE BILL FOR ABOUT. RIGHT THE BILL HAS A MOTION ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS BY MY COLLEAGUES. YES GO AHEAD SENATOR WIENER. DO. WE ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE THE- FACT OF. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ON ALL THE AUTHORITY- NO TODAY ON THIS MEASURE- ID- YOU KNOW I AND I UNDERSTAND- YOU KNOW I ALSO IN MY OWN COMMUNITY I THINK PEOPLE HAVE A PERCEPTION SAN FRANCISCO- IS ALWAYS A CERTAIN WAY BUT YOU KNOW I THINK PEOPLE WANT TO FEEL SAFE- EVERYWHERE- AND- SOMETIMES- PEOPLE. I THINK THAT SOME OF THESE LAWS ARE SOMEHOW UNDERMINE INNER CITY AND I AND I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK. THAT THAT IS TRUE AND IN PARTICULAR I ONE THING I AND I CURE LAW ENFORCEMENT SAY THAT SOMETIMES THAT OKAY THIS. BIRD IT. TO ME. AND SO- WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE- LAST I CHECKED IF SOMETHING IS A MISDEMEANOR YOU CAN BE ARRESTED FOR THAT YOU CAN BE PROSECUTED AND YOU CAN SPEND SIX OR TWELVE MONTHS IN COUNTY JAIL ON IT SO JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING IS A MISDEMEANOR. DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE PEOPLE SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR BEHAVIOR BUT HOLDING SOMEONE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR BEHAVIOR DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO DESTROY THEIR LIVES IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO EXPLODE POPULATION OVER STATE PRISON SYSTEM. TO THE POINT WHERE YOU SEE AN CSU STUDENTS ARE HAVING TO PAY TUITION THAT THAT THEY CAN AFFORD- WERE IF USER YOU KNOW CHOICES THAT WE MADE- THEY HAVEN'T BUT DID NOT MOVE WENT THROUGH ALL THE DECADES OF ADDING SO MANY NEW STATE PRISONS EXPLODED OUR STATE PRISON POPULATION THAT DID NOT MAKE CALIFORNIA A SAFER- BUT IT IT UNDERMINE THINGS LIKE THE CASE PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION- SO ID- YOU KNOW I WE MUST HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR BEHAVIOR BUT WE CAN DO IT IN A WAY. THAT DOESN'T EXPLODE THE PRISM BUDGET- AND DOESN'T TEAR COMMUNITIES APART I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO CLOSE THANK YOU MANAGER. COUPLE THINGS. EIGHT THE BONE MARROW COMMENT THAT'S MAYBE ONE IN A MILLION IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN MUCH BUT STILL GET COULD HAPPEN I HAVE THREE BUT- WOW. AND THE STATISTICS OF CRIME GOING DOWN ME ONE OF THE REASONS I'VE BEEN TOLD BY LAW ENFORCEMENT ASK BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO ARREST PEOPLE. I'M SORRY IN. MY SPEAKING TO YOU. OKAY THANK YOU- IN AND LASTLY ON ON JUST I SPEAK TO A LOT ALONG FORSMAN PEOPLE AND THEY DO TELL ME- COUNTY RIVERSIDE THIS WAS WELL SAM DO YOU KNOW. ORANGE COUNTY THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO ARREST THESE FOLKS- THESE DAYS. IN AND ANOTHER THING TOO I KIND OF. WASN'T SURE WHAT. SENATOR FROM SAM CISCO SAND BUT- A IN HERE BUT I HOPE YOU DIDN'T SAY SAM SAYS WAS A SAFE PLACE BECAUSE EVERYTHING YOU READ THE NEWS. OAKLAND AND SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES- ARE EXPERIENCING. SOME REAL CHALLENGES IN AND- THERE'S A LIST OF REASONS WHY PEOPLE LEAVE CALIFORNIA'S YOU KNOW ALL. OVER MILLION HAVE LEFT IN THE LAST FEW YEARS PART OF ITS HIGH TAXES- BUT ALSO CRIME. AND FILL IN UNSAFE SO ANYWAY EY LOOK AT THAT'S THAT'S MY- CLOTHES AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE BOTH. AND THANK YOU FOR. YOUR PATIENCE WITH ME EARLIER THANK YOU. NOT A PROBLEM. ALL RIGHT WE WILL. WITHOUT IT THE COMMENTS WE WILL TAKE A ROLL CALL ON. SB SEVEN TEN.

EMPLOYERS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WILL START WITH. MEMBERS WE HAVE A PRESENTATION OF THE BILL AS SHE ARE SIXTY AND OUR DIGNITY INCARCERATED WORKERS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AS C. E. R. SIXTY NINE EXPRESSES LEGISLTORS PORT. FOR FAIR AND JUST WAGES FOR INCARCERATED PERSONS AND RECOGNIZES THE NEED TO EXAMINE THEIR PAY SCALE AND EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOR THE THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION ABOLISHED SLAVERY EXCEPT FOR THE PUNISHMENT OF A CRIME. THIS PROVISION IT- THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT OPEN THE DOOR FOR PRISON LABOR AFTER THE CIVIL WAR AND CONTINUE TO. THE EARLY NINETEEN FORTIES INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS WERE LEASED OUT TO PLANTATION OWNERS ARE MANUFACTURED FOR CHEAP LABOR THE SYSTEM WAS LATER REPLACED WOULD WHAT IS COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE CHAIN GANG WERE SHACKLED INDIVIDUALS WERE FORCED TO WORK. HELPING BUILD OUR OUR STATE INFRASTRUCTURE SUCH AS BRIDGES AND HIGHWAYS. THE HUMAN A HUMAN IS A- AS IN OUR STATE PROP WAS WIDESPREAD THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES TODAY IN CALIFORNIA OR OR FORTY TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE IMPRISONMENT WORK FULL TIME EARNING SOMEWHERE BETWEEN EIGHT CENTS TO THREE DOLLARS AND NINETY CENTS TODAY A DAY. OF THE FORTY TWO THOUSAND CARS WORKERS OVER THREE THOUSAND CARS OR IF PEOPLE WORK FOR MERGE THE FIREFIGHTERS RISKING THEIR LIVES AND THEIR SAFETY AND PROTECTION OF OUR- TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES. ANY EARN ON AVERAGE OF A DOLLAR AN HOUR. NOT ONLY ARE THE EMERGENCY FOR OUR FIGHTERS PAID ONE TWENTY SEVENTH OF THE EARNINGS FOR SWORN FIREFIGHTERS. THERE ARE FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE OBJECTED RELATED. OBJECT RELATED INJURIES AND EIGHT TIMES MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE SMOKE INHALATION RELATED TO- THE WORK WITH IN OUR PRISON SYSTEM THOUSANDS OF INCARCERATED LABORS WORK ABSOLUTE TRADITIONS CARPENTERS COOKS ORDERLIES BRAILLE TRANSCRIBERS SOAK SCREENERS AND MANY OTHER AND TRICKLED POSITIONS ESSENTIAL. ODD TO THE OPERATIONS OF OUR STATE. IT'S ANOTHER SEVEN THOUSAND INCARCERATED WORKERS ARE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE CALIFORNIA PRISON INDUSTRY AT THE WILL BE CAPITA ALL WHICH MANUFACTURES AND SELL PRODUCTS MADE BY INCARCERATED WORKERS CAL PJ. NEVER AGAIN REVENUE BECAUSE THE STATE POLICE MARKET RATE FOR THESE ITEMS IN THE WORKERS ASSEMBLE AND MANUFACTURE THESE PRODUCTS EARN ONLY A FRACTION OF THE MARKET WAGE INCARCERATED. WORKERS PRODUCED OVER FOURTEEN HUNDRED GOODS AND SERVICES INCLUDING WORLD FINDS CLOTHING CLEAN BOX LICENSE PLATES AND OFFICE FURNITURE ABA WHICH IRONICALLY MUCH IS IN THE SPRING TODAY. AIMED INCARCERATED WORKERS A FAIR AND JUST WAY TO WILL NOT ONLY PER INDIVIDUAL INCOME COMMUNAL ECONOMIC STABILITY BUT IT ALSO FROM PROVES PERSONAL DIGNITY THE ABILITY TO SAVE AN ACCUMULATE- WHILE IN PRISON AFFORDS INDIVIDUALS AT ADEQUATE YEAR OF THE WORK THEY ARE PERFORMING AND BETTER PREPARES DOWN. FOR THE COMMUNITY WHICH THEY WILL RETURN TO. ESTIMATES INDICATE FORMALLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE ALL 60% OF THEIR INCOME TWO FORMS OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE DEBT. AND ONLY 55% OF FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS REPORTED EARNINGS DURING THE FIRST YEAR AFTER BEING RELEASED WHICH INCREAES WITH INCREASED WAGES INCARCERATED WORKERS CAN CONTRIBUTE MONETARY MEANS. TO THEIR FAMILIES PAY CHILD SUPPORT DRASTICALLY DECREASED AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THEY OWE TO RESTITUTION AND ALLOWS. FOR THE ACCUMULATION OF SAVINGS TO A SYSTEM ONCE THEY MAKE THE TRANSITION BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY MOST IMPORTANTLY INCREASE WAGES WILL HELP REDUCE RECIDIVISM RECIDIVISM. AND MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER WITH ME TODAY IS KEVIN OLIVER FROM LEGAL SERVICES FOR PRISONERS WITH CHILDREN AND YES- BUT DARLE BUT OUR LOW OF THE WESTERN CENTER OF LAW AND POVERTY AND I REQUEST REVIVAL. THANK YOU GO AHEAD WITNESSES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JESSICA BARTOLO THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AS YOU KNOW THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WORKED ON BEHALF OF LOW INCOME PEOPLE IN THE COURTS. IN THE LEGISLATURE AND BUDGET ADVOCACY. WE ARE REALLY PROUD TO COSPONSOR THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION BECAUSE- OF. THAT SO MANY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IMPRISONED IN CALIFORNIA ARE POOR. THEY WERE POOR BEFORE THEY WERE STOPPED THEY WERE SUPPORT BEFORE THEY WERE CITED. BEFORE THEY WERE ARRESTED. BEFORE THEY WERE. CONVICTED AND BEFORE THEY WERE DETAINED IN PRISON. NOT ONLY THAT 54% OF THEM ARE PARENTS THEY LEAVE BEHIND CHILDREN AND FAMILIES AT HOME THEIR FAMILIES ARE STRUGGLING WITH POVERTY WITH THE BENEFIT OF ONE INCOME AND NOT TO AND THAT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT WORKING FORTY SIX THOUSAND. PEOPLE IN PRISON TODAY IN CALIFORNIA ARE WORKING THEY HAVE A JOB BUT AS YOU HEARD THE SENATOR TESTIFYTHE EARNINGS AND HE'S ON THE DOLLAR. WHEN THEY DO RECEIVE AGE 55% OF THE IN PRISON GOES TOWARDS RESTITUTION AND IS PAID TOWARDS THE VICTIM SO NOT ONLY ARE FAMILIES LOSING OUT BACK HOME BUT SO ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE. COUNTING ON THE RESTITUTION TO MOVE ON WITH THEIR LIVES. SO WHERE DOES THAT FAMILIES. RECEIVE OF ART THAT PEOPLE RECEIVE IN PRISON AS USE AS YOU HEARD- CAN RANGE BETWEEN. EIGHT CENTS ON THE DOLLAR EIGHT CENTS PER HOUR TO APPROXIMATELY THREE DOLLARS AN HOUR. AND AGAIN ADD THESE TO OURS- GO TOWARDS RESTITUTION THE OTHER THINGS THEY DON'T GO TOWARDS OUR CHILD SUPPORT- PEOPLE IN PRISON YOU STILL NEED TO PAY FOR A PHONE CALLS PHONE CALLS HOME. PHONE CALLS TO PEOPLE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES TO RETAIN THOSE CONNECTIONS AND BE ABLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN RE RECIDIVISM ARE TO PREVENT RECIDIVISM WHEN THEY RE ENTER AND ALSO TO PAY FOR PERSONAL HYGIENE MANY PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT. PERSONAL HYGIENE IS NOT COVERED- AND MANY ITEMS OF PERSONAL HYGIENE IS NOT COVERED WHILE IN PRISON. AS WE MENTIONED BEFORE AT AN AVERAGE OF. ABOUT 40% OF PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED HAVE CHILDREN. THIS MEANS ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY- CHILDREN ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE A PARENT IN PRISON. IN CALIFORNIA- WE CAN EXPECT THAT THE SAME PERCENTAGE IS ABOUT THE SAME AND THAT ABOUT 11% ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN CHILDREN. AND ABOUT THREE PERF AT 5% OF AT HISPANIC OR LATINO CHILDREN HAVE A PARENT IN PRISON THIS COMPARED TO ONLY ABOUT 2% OF. OF WHITE CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEEN INCARCERATED PARENTS. SOME CLOSING. WE WANT TO POINT OUT THAT SEARCHED FOR CHANGING A PRISON WORKERS BECAUSE IT SAVES THE STATE MONEY IS PENNY WISE POUND FOOLISH IT UNDERMINES RECIDIVISM IT INCREASES POVERTY AT HOME IT LEAVES VICTIMS WITHOUT RESTITUTION PAYMENTS THEY SHOULD GET AND IT MAKES IT REALLY HARD FOR. TO REENTER COMMUNITY INCREASING PRISON COSTS LATER DOWN THE ROAD. AND MORE THAN THAT. IT MAKES PEOPLE SUFFER FROM AS YOU WILL HEAR ME TESTIFY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR WHEN A CHILD IS IN POVERTY. I THEY'RE GOING WITH OTHER BASIC NEEDS. AROUND WITHOUT FOOD FOR GOING WITHOUT SHELTER. THEY'RE GOING OUT WITHOUT HUMAN DIGNITY THAT THEY NEED TO GROW HEALTHY AND OUR GREAT STATE. FOR THESE REASONS WE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. NEXT WHAT. MEMBERSHIP PERSON WITH THE AMOUNT OF THINKING ABOUT IT THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME OF- BUT A MERE GLIMPSE OF- BY MY COLLEAGUE TO THE RIGHT SO ELOQUENT SPOKE ABOUT- I DID TWENTY FOUR YEARS IN PRISON UNDER CALIFORNIA'S THREE STRIKES LAW. FOR NON VIOLENT CRIME- UPON MY RELEASE ABOUT SEVEN MONTHS AGO OUR DEPLOYED BY LEGAL SERVICES FOR PRISONERS WITH CHILDREN- AS A PARALEGAL IN A COMMUNITY- ORGAN- WE'RE HERE CO SPONSORING AND SUPPORTING- SCR SIXTY NINE BECAUSE IT RESTORES DIGNITY AND OF FAIR WAGES TO PEOPLE IN PRISON- THE- THE PROBLEM THAT I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH- DURING MY TWENTY FOUR YEARS MAN COST RATIO I WORKED APPROXIMATELY TWENTY OF THOSE YEARS- BURN. MORE THAN FIFTY TWENTY MONTH AFTER RESTITUTION WAS A- OUT OF A PAYCHECK. I LEFT THREE SMALL CHILDREN BEHIND AT FOUR FIVE YEARS OLD FOUR FIVE AND SIX YEARS OLD- UPON MY REST- DURING THE ENTIRE COURSE MY CORPORATION I WAS NOT ABLE FINANCIALLY TO HELP SUPPORT MY CHILDREN I OFTEN HAD TO RELY ON- EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBERS MY PARENTS MY SISTERS- IN BROTHER TO HELP OF PROVIDE FUNDING TO SUPPORT MY CHILDREN- OFTENTIMES I WAS AT. THE BOTTOM BIRTHDAY GIFT SIR. IS MISS GIFS OR SUPPORT THEM. DISTANCE IS OFTEN AND REMOTE PARTS OF CALIFORNIA TO VISIT- WHICH ALSO PRESENTED PROBLEMS FOR ME TO HAVE CONSISTENT COMMUNICATION TWO PHONE CALLS. SURE MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE OF GTL THAT IS OUR MAIN PHONE FEES IT CAN SOMETIMES ONE HUNDRED TO THREE DOLLARS A MONTH JUST TO KEEP IN CONTACT WITH FAMILY ON A REGULAR BASIS- SO THE IDEA OF WORKING IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT. IN THIS IN THE IN ESSENCE IT IS INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE MADE A VERY PROBLEMATIC FOR ME FINANCIALLY- TO SUPPORT THOSE THAT I LOVE AND IN ADDITION TO PAY RESTITUTION TAKE YOUR MOM RESPONSIBILITIES. THE WAY IT'S SET UP IN CALIFORNIA THE ARE NOW. IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE LARGE AMOUNTS RESTITUTION IF THEY'RE NOT WORKING OFTENTIMES ARE FAMILY MEMBERS OF THAT TO CARRY THE BURDEN OF THE RESTITUTION BASED ON THEM TRYING TO SUPPORT YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE HYGIENE. MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE NECESSITIES TO SURVIVE IN A PRISON ENVIRONMENT- WHICH IS PROBLEMATIC THIS FROM A% RESPONSIBILITY STANDPOINT IS THAT YOU PASS THAT BURDEN ON TO PEOPLE WE'VE ALREADY HARMED- YOUR FAMILIES WITH OFTEN CAN'T AFFORD EITHER SO WHEN THE WHEN THE IDEA OF COULD YOU SEND ME HUNDRED DOLLARS TO GO TO CANTEEN TO GET SOME BASIC NECESSITIES AND YOU ONLY GET FORTY FIVE. OR THAT IT'S PROBLEMATIC WITH THEM THEN I WANT TO DO IT. OFTENTIMES BECAUSE THEY DON'T. WANT TO. FOR YOU. MOTHER EXPERIENCES IN PRISON AND REFERENCE TO WORK- WHEN I WASN'T WORKING I ATTEMPTED TO GO TO COLLEGE SEVERAL TIMES PRIOR TO- JUNIOR COLLEGE BEING ACCESSIBLE TO PRISONERS NOW IS IT IS- AND IT WAS PROBLEMATIC FOR ME FROM A FINANCIAL STANDPOINT TO PAY FOR TUITION AND ABOUT MY OWN SCHOOL BOOKS WHICH MOST OF THE COLLEGE PROGRAMS REQUIRE YOU TO DO- FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU GO TO- AN OUTSIDE THE STATE INSTITUTIONS OFTEN SEVEN OR EIGHT HOURS OF COURSE. OF THE BOOKS CAN BE A HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A PIECE AND IF YOU HAVE ANYBODY TO PAY FOR THOSE THINGS IN YOUR ACTUAL ACTUALLY STOP FROM BEING ABLE TO GO TO COLLEGE FOR MYSELF IT WAS A PROBLEM BECAUSE THAT ACT TO GRADUATE HIGH RIDER TO RATIONS SO BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT. AT THE TOP CAME IN DIDN'T OFFER. EDUCATE OUT TOMORROW VICES. IT MADE A PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE I WASN'T ABLE TO FOR- ADVANCE AMOUNT EDUCATION SYSTEM. ARE OF MY OWN EDUCATION- SO TO ME IT IT'S A IT'S A VERY CHALLENGING PROBLEM- AND ALICE PC BELIEVES FIRMLY THAT- INSTITUTING FAIR WAGES ACROSS THE BOARD AND CALIFORNIA PRISONS WILL ALLOW US TO. SUPPORT OURSELVES AND SELF DETERMINE A LOUD TO BEGIN THE WORK. WELL OUT OF THE HOUSE SO THAT ARE IN PRISON WITH PEOPLE ACTUALLY ABLE TO RUN THEIR OWN. THE LEFT TO. THE STILL BAGS SUGAR OUT OF THE KITCHEN GOES. ON THE MAIN LINE IN PRISON TO HUSTLE UP BARS OF SOAP AND IN A BAG OF CHIPS FOR SNACKS OR WHATEVER. UP ANOTHER THING I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT TODAY SPECIFICALLY IS ABOUT RE ENTRY. GET MONEY CALIFORNIA'S BEEN THE SAME FOR FIFTY YEARS. TO OUR DOLLARS AND IT HASN'T KEPT UP WITH INFLATION WHICH I BELIEVE NOW THE NUMBERS ARE EVER HEARD DOLLARS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE REPRESENTS. A FIVE HUNDRED TODAY WELL THE ONLY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT OF THE LOOP OR CALIFORNIA PRISONERS AND- THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THAT WHEN A PERSON. YES RELEASE FROM PRISON TODAY AFTER DOING TWENTY THIRTY YEARS. THE GIVEN TWO HOURS GAVE MONEY IN RECEIVING A RELEASE. PRIOR TO LEAVING RECEIVING A RELEASE YOU HAVE COMPANIES LIKE ACCESS INTO T. O. WHO INSTITUTED THE DEBIT CARD SYSTEMS WITH CDC ARE WITH THE TAKEN FIVE DOLLARS PER TRANSACTION. AND SO BY THE TIME YOU LEAVE OUT OUR IN OUR WITH A TEE SHIRT. KHAKIS AND A PAIR OF- OF BENTON'S USUALLY LEFT WITH SEVEN DOLLARS AND A BUS TICKET. TO ARRIVE IN LOS ONE OF AREAS. INTO YOUR TWO WEEKS OUT BASICALLY FROM SUPPORT SERVICES A SOCIAL SERVICES THAT EXIST IN THE CITY'S- BEING ABLE TO ANSWER TO FAIR WAGES. WE WOULD ALLOW PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY BUILD MONEY IN SAVINGS VERY SIMILAR WHAT. HE DOES WITH THE JOINT VENTURE PROGRAM. IN CALIFORNIA PRISONS WHERE THEY ALLOW PRIVATE COMPANIES TO COME IN AND PAY MINIMUM WAGE TO THE WORKER- WHICH IS IRONIC BECAUSE WE REQUIRE THAT BY LAW WITHIN TI. DOESN'T HAVE TO DO THAT. SO PEOPLE. ACTUALLY OF A BANK ACCOUNT SAVE MONEY UPON THE RELEASE OF WORK IN. PAROLE WITH YOU KNOW TEN FIFTEEN TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT YOU SAVE OVER THE COURSE OF. TIME ALLOWS YOU GET PERSON LAST MONTH ON HOUSING. IT ALLOWS YOU TO GET A VEHICLE ALLOWS YOU GET CLOSE ALLOWS YOU KIND OF GET ON YOUR FEET IN SUPPORT YOURSELF. UP WHICH IS IT WHICH IS NEEDED BECAUSE WE SHOW PART FOR A RECIDIVISM OCCURS WITHIN THE FIRST NINETY. DAYS TO ONE YEAR- AND WE BELIEVE THAT IF WE ALLOW PEOPLE TO SELF DETERMINE EARNED MONEY THAT ALLOW THEM EASIER TRANSITION UPON. OF SOME PRETTY ACTUALLY. INCREASE PUBLIC SAFETY BECAUSE NOT PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE SUPPORT SYSTEMS WON'T. BE FENDING FOR THEMSELVES WITH ECONOMIC STRESSORS- WITHIN THE FIRST THREE TO SIX MONTHS GETTING OUT AND THIS MAY CAUSE THEM TO. A WEEK CRIME. THAT YOU KNOW WE WOULD HOPE THAT YOU'RE- MISSION AND APPLY FAIR WAGES IN THE PRISON ENVIRONMENT TO ALLOW PEOPLE SOME SENSE OF DIGNITY AND TO ALLOW THEM A BETTER CHANCE A TRANSITION WITH A RELEASE. THANK YOU LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS WITH YOUR INDULGENCE MAYBE JUST LESS THAN A MINUTE I'M A CRISTINA I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS THIRTY TWO THOUSAND FIREFIGHTERS IN CALIFORNIA. A WE'RE PLEASED TO BE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION. EVERY ONE DESERVES DIGNITY IN THEIR WORK. UP PAYING INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR DOESN'T REFLECT THE COMMITMENT TO REHABILITATION PAYING RESTITUTION AND CHANGING A PERSON'S VALUE OF WORK. OF WE'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR AND QUESTIONING THE JUSTICE OF PUTTING INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS AND IDEALLY TO ENVIRONMENT IMMEDIATE DANGER TO THEIR LIFE AND HEALTH BUT ON THE SUBJECT TO THIS RESOLUTION. WE THINK CARE CALIFORNIA SHOULD REFLECT ITS STATED COMMITMENTS AND VALUE THE WORK BY THESE IN CAR INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS WE ARE SUPPORT. THE OTHERS CAME AND.

LENDING CROWDY LEGAL SERVICES REPRESENTS WHAT CHILDREN IS STRONG SUPPORT. RIGHT ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT LET'S SEE THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT. ONE NINE- I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS- I THINK IT'S A VERY VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND CALIFORNIANS NEED TO DISCUSS AN ODD IN ADDITION TO THE VARIOUS- REASONS THAT ALL ALL OF YOUR TESTIMONY IN THE AUTHOR DESCRIBE FOR WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT. TO THE CHILDREN OF PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED SHOULD NOT BE THE VICTIMS TODAY AND THOSE CHILDREN AS WE KNOW IN MANY MANY CIRCUMSTANCES END UP IN FOSTER CARE. AND IF NOT FOUGHT HERE THEN IS DESCRIBED IT IS WITHOUT THAT PERSON DOUBT PARENT BEING ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR SUPPORT. THEY ARE THERE'S A VERY SERIOUS CYCLE OF POVERTY. AND THEIR PARENT WHILE INCARCERATED IF THEY'RE WORKING BEING ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS THAT CHILD SUPPORT. AND WELFARE ALSO REDUCES THE COST TO THE STATE BECAUSE MUCH OF THE I MEAN THE POVERTY PROGRAMS ARE FUNDED BY TAXPAYERS AND YOU HAVE A PERSON THAT. WHILE THEY'RE INCARCERATED THEY'RE WORKING COULD BE OFF CITY THAT- TAXPAYER BURDEN IN ADDITION TO GREATLY IMPROVING THE CONDITION OF THOSE CHILDREN- SO I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF. THIS OF YOUR INITIATING THIS DISCUSSION AND THIS RESOLUTION AND WOULD ASK TO BE A CO AUTHOR YOUR WILL. MORE THAN WILLING THANK YOU MANAGER SO THE RESOLUTION ALL RIGHT AND CENTER MITCHELL DID YOU WANNA MAKING FUN. WISH IT WAS A BILL THAT A RESOLUTION BUT I WOULD RATHER. ALL RIGHT SENATOR JACKSON'S. COME ON IN AND- YOU STARTED TO PLACE ORDERS A LOT OF DISCUSSION. ABOUT THIS RESOLUTION DEALS WITH- THE INABILITY TO HELP SUPPORT ONE'S FAMILY WHILE INCARCERATED HE INABILITY TO. PAY CHILD SUPPORT THIS WAS AN ISSUE THAT I SO MANY YEARS AGO WORD WHEN MAN PARTICULAR ONE COURSE RATED AND. THE LOOK YOU KNOW NO OPPORTUNITY FOR THEIR PARTNERS AND THEIR CHILDREN TO COME TO GET ANY ANY COMPENSATION WHICH OF COURSE MEANT THAT THE PUBLIC WAS PAYING FOR THROUGH THE WELFARE SYSTEM. IS THERE SOMETHING IN THIS RESOLUTION I DIDN'T SEE IT BUT IS THERE SOMETHING THAT TALKS ABOUT. IN PAYING A REASONABLE. RATE FOR PEOPLE'S WORK WHICH I THINK IS JUST FUNDAMENTAL IS THERE SOME. A MECHANISM TO ASSURE THAT IF THERE ARE A DEBT TO RESPONSIBILITIES OR CHILDREN THAT SOME OF THAT. INCOME WILL. GO FOR THAT PURPOSE SO THAT THAT THE ART THAT THE CHILDREN OF THESE INCARCERATED FOLKS WE'LL BE SEEING SOME MONEY- AS A RESULT OF THE LABOR THEIR PARENTS AND IN PRISON. RECORD THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION AND FOR YOUR DILIGENCE ON THIS ISSUE- THE CURRENT LAW ACTUALLY A REQUIRES A CHILD SUPPORT ORDER TO CONTINUE WHILE THE UNLESS A PERSON CAN SHOW POVERTY UP UNTIL TWO THOUSAND TEN A CALIFORNIA AND MANY OTHER STATES WERE NOT ALLOWING A PERSON WHO WAS IN PRISON I TO DECLARE INVOLUNTARY POVERTY THEY WERE AS STATING THAT THIS WAS VOLUNTARY PRETTY AND THEREFORE THE ORDERS WILL CONTINUE BEING AS A RESULT THE AVERAGE PERSON A PERSON EXITING PRISON HAS AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN CHILD SUPPORT AT THE DANGER. THE CHANCE TO HAVE BEEN THE CASE. AFTER AFTER THAT COURT CASE THE MOMENT CAN ISSUED A NEW RULES IN TWENTY SIXTEEN- CALIFORNIA WAS SUPPOSED TO IMPLEMENT POLICIES THAT WOULD ALLOW PEOPLE TO CLAIM INVOLUNTARY POVERTY DURING IMPRISONMENT AND TO REDUCE THIS ORDER BUT THAT THAT IS BASED ON THEIR CONDITION OF NOT BEING PAID IF THEY WERE INDEED OR FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR THEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY THE SAME OR FIFTEEN OR THIRTEEN WHICH IS THE MINIMUM WAGE TODAY THANK YOU TO THE SENATE A FOR LEADING THAT CHARGE. AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY A THE SAME THING WITH SOME ELSE WOULD HAVE TO PAY AT THIRTEEN DOLLARS THERE WILL BE SOME INSISTS THAT MONEY WOULD BE GOING OUT AND SUPPORTING THE FAMILY. OKAY ART I CALL IT HAS AN AMPLE. RIGHT EARLY IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES CDC IMPLEMENTED A JOINT VENTURE PROGRAM OF THE ALLOWED PRIVATE THE WHOLE COMPANIES TO COME TO THE PRISON ACTUALLY WORK AND SET UP SHOP TO REDUCE THINGS LIKE SUNGLASSES AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE AND ONE OF THE THINGS THE CDC DID IS THEY SET UP BANK ACCOUNTS FOR EACH PRISONER THAT PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. AND 50% OF THE MONEY THAT A PERSON WOULD GET FROM PAYCHECK WOULD GO TOWARDS RESTITUTION AND GO TOWARD OTHER FINDS AN OBLIGATION THAT THEY HAD INCLUDING CHILD SUPPORT AND THEN THEY TOOK THE OTHER 50% ACTUALLY PUT IN A BANK ACCOUNT FORM. I THINK MAKE ABOUT. THE TIME THAT THEY WERE USING. I'LL BE ABLE TO SAVE MONEY. UPON RELEASE SO YOU WOULD JUST GET THAT MONEY I TRUST ACCOUNT PER SE YOU WOULD HAVE THE MONEY. IN A BANK ACCOUNT BUT- X. AMOUNT OF DOLLARS WOULD GO TO YOUR TRUST ACCOUNT FOR THINGS LIKE CANTEEN ETCETERA. THEN YOU ALSO HAVE A SAVINGS. THAT TO THE SIDE FOR YOU SO. AFTER A YEAR TWO YEARS THREE YEARS FOUR YEARS FIVE YEARS WORKING. YOU OUT OF A VIABLE SUM OF MONEY. THAT YOU COULD USE TO EITHER SEND HOME TO YOUR FAMILY SAID YOUR WIVES AND YOUR PARENTS AND YOUR SISTER OR TO USE. ON RE ENTRY. WHICH I THINK IS VALUABLE BECAUSE WHEN YOU CAN PAROLE. OR BE THESE FROM PRESENT WITH MONEY TO SUSTAIN YOUR HOUSING WITH MONEY TO SUSTAIN YOUR TRANSPORTATION. AND NOT HAVE TO RELY ON THE STATE AND GO TO SOCIAL SERVICES AND GO TO THAT WHOLE- MORASS. OF STUFF THAT WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH WE GET OUT. AND WE DON'T HAVE THE SUPPORT SYSTEM I THINK IT'S JUST. INVALUABLE I THINK. SO THAT'S MY- MY- WHEN CAN. BUT I DO WANNA. SAY N. TO FOLLOW UP WITH WHAT THE CHURCH SAID- HERE THIS DOES CREATE A CYCLE OF POVERTY IF WE TO AND- THE NOTION. AND I HOPE WE GET WAY FOR THIS NOTION THAT WE- PEOPLE EVEN AFTER THEY'VE DONE THEIR TIME. OF THE NOTION THAT YOU GET OUT WITH TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS AND AFTER YOU PAY THE FIVE DOLLARS EVERY TIME YOU DO A TRANSACTION OR THE MONEY THAT IT COSTS YOU TO MAKE PHONE CALLS. WE GOTTA START TREATING PEOPLE IN PRISON LIKE HUMAN BEINGS BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO GET OUT AND IF WE WANT TO KEEP THEM OUT AND REDUCE RECIDIVISM AND I THINK MANY OF US HERE BEEN TO- HAVE SEEN THIS IN THE HALL I KEEP THINKING BACK ON THE TRIP I TOOK TO THE HOLDEN PRISON. IN NORWAY NO PEOPLE COME IN AND THEY TREAT THEM LIKE HUMAN BEINGS AND THEY AG AND WHEN YOU'RE TREATED LIKE A HUMAN BEING AND PROBABLY KNOWS FOR ANYONE THERE ARE CERTAIN EXPECTATIONS THAT YOU ARE GOING MEET BUT IF YOU TREATED. AS LESS THAN A PERSON YOU BEHAVE THAT ASIAN THAT WHEN YOU TREAT PEOPLE BADLY. YOU DON'T REYES SAID BAR YOU'RE GONNA SEE PEOPLE AT THAT LOWER LEVEL. OF BEHAVIOR AND THAT. DOESN'T BENEFIT ANYBODY SO THE NOTION. THAT WE PAY PEOPLE WHAT IS IT THREE CENTS TO THIRTY CENTS TO THREE DOLLARS I MEAN WHAT WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT THE WHAT WE THINK OF THE VALUE OF SOMEBODY'S WERE. AND SO ARE YEAH I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE YOU KNOW WHAT THE ULTIMATE DOLLARS ARE BUT I THINK IS A BASIC PRINCIPLE WE'VE GOT TO START RECOGNIZING AS THEY DO IN NORWAY THE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET OUT OF PRISON. THEIR AVERAGE LENGTH OF TIME FOR A MAJOR OFFENDERS EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO THREE YEARS. SO THEY START RIGHT WHEN THOSE PEOPLE GO INTO PRISON THE HELP THEM FIGURE OUT HOW NOT TO COME BACK. ONE OF THE WAYS TO TREAT PEOPLE LIKE HUMAN BEINGS. IT'S WHITE THAT'S A DIRECTION WHICH WERE MOVING. I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR FOR HER COMMENTS AS WELL THANK YOU FOR. BRINGING THIS RESOLUTION I HOPE THAT THAT'S THE CONVERSATION WE START HAVING RATHER THAN. CONTINUING TO PUNISH PEOPLE THEY'VE DONE THEIR TIME- HOPEFULLY DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME THEY'VE LEARNED A TRADER THEY'VE LEARNED. WHATEVER IT IS A CAUGHT THEM THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND HOW TO OVERCOME THAT. SO THAT WE CAN REDUCE THE COST OF THESE PRISONS IS JUST RIDICLOUS. COMPARED TO WHAT WE PAY TO EDUCATE CHILDREN AND KEEP THEM OUT OF PRISON SO. I HOPE WE'RE IN A POSITIVE TRAJECTORY AND I THINK THIS IS A RESOLUTION THAT WILL CERTAINLY HELP US GET THERE SO THANK YOU. FOR THAT THANKS FOR THE AFTERNOON SAY A FEW WORDS. FOR MORE LIKE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THIS IS A VERY INTRIGUING IDEA BUT LOOKING AT THE DATA IN THE IN THE HISTORY AND ALSO OUR STAFF REPORT- OR- CALIFORNIA MAY BE BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE BUT IT'S NOT VERY FAR BELOW WORK. SO THIS IS THIS IS THE. THE WAY THINGS ARE BEING DONE ALL FIFTY STATES SO I'M I'M I'M KIND OF CURIOUS. ABOUT TWO THINGS ONE IS WE'RE NOT AN OUT LIAR. WE'LL BE DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT WHAT WOULD THE INDUSTRY IN FORTY NINE STATES BE THINKING AND THE SECOND WOULD BE WHERE WOULD THE FUNDING COME FROM. AS WE ALREADY HAVE A PRETTY. FREE. LARGE BUDGET FOR PUBLIC SAFETY AND IN REGARDS TO OUR PRISON SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. WITH A GROUP GREAT PRIDE IN LEADING THE NATION IN ALMOST EVERYTHING ELSE SO WHY SHOULD WE LEGALIZE NATION AND PRISON REFORM IN RESTITUTION TO INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK ON AGAIN WE ENDED SLAVERY IN THIS COUNTRY AND- EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE AND JUST BECAUSE ONE HAS COMMITTED A CRIME DOESN'T MEAN THAT. YOU SHOULD BE ENSLAVED AND NOW FORCED TO WORK FOR FREE SO WHY SHOULDN'T CALIFORNIA LEAD AWAY AND SHOWING HOW WE CAN TREAT INDIVIDUALS WERE INCARCERATED I THINK ON SENATOR FROM SANTA BARBARA CLEARLY- GAVE EXAMPLES OF HOW THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TREAT THEIR INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS SO WHY SHOULD WE WANT TO FOLLOW THAT MODEL. AS FAR AS THE BUDGET IT'S ALL ABOUT PRIORITIES THIS IS A BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRIES A PRISON LABOR AND JUST FROM. LICENSE PLATES AND ALL THE OTHER STUFF THAT WE BUY IN THIS BUILDING ALONE WE COULD AFFORD TO PAY ARE IN MAKES FAR MORE THAN EIGHT CENTS AN HOUR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AFTER SO. BEFORE I ASK FOR THE CLOTHES. I WANTED TO JUST MAKE THE ADDITIONAL COMMENT THAT. WELL I FOCUSED ON CHILDREN I THINK- SENATOR BRADFORD YOU'RE VERY POINT THAT THIS THAT HOW THIS SYSTEM WAS EVEN ABLE TO EVOLVE WAS THROUGH THAT- AMENDMENT TO OUR CONSTITUTION. THAT WHILE IT ELIMINATED SLAVERY ALLOWED FOR SLAVERY WITHIN THOSE PEOPLE WHOM WE INCARCERATE AND WE ARE STILL. THIS IS A THIS IS STILL A REMNANT OF THAT AND I THINK WHAT WE HAVE WHAT WE AS A STATE AND I THINK THE SOCIETY AT LARGE BUT DEFINITELY WE AS A STATE. HAVE BEEN MOVING CLEARING CLEAR ROAD IS THAT IT IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR US TO RELY ON ANY ONE'S LABOR. WITHOUT COMPENSATION FOR THAT LABOR AND WE MADE A FIRST STEP THIS LAST YEAR WITH STUDENT ATHLETES WHILE WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THEM PAY. WE AT LEAST RECOGNIZED THAT THEY WERE PRODUCING WEALTH THAT THEY WERE NOT BEING ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM AND IN THIS CASE. ARE INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS ARE PRODUCING WEALTH AND THEY'RE PRODUCING GOODS FOR THE HOOD THE STATE AND MANY OTHERS. AND THE IRONY IS AND THEN IT'S A GREAT COST TO THE STATE FOR SETTING IT UP THAT WAY BECAUSE EITHER. THE PERSON OF EITHER THEIR RESTITUTION IS NOT BEING PAID THEIR CHILDREN ARE NOT BEING SUPPORTED OR THEY THEMSELVES COME OUT WITH HUGE DEBT BECAUSE YOU WHATEVER DATE YOU HAD WHEN YOU WALK IN A PRISON YOU STILL HAVE WHEN YOU COME OUT. AND WE JUST CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR INABILITY TO REALLY BE SUCCESSFUL- SO IT'S SIX HUGE IS FILE COST WEST WE HAVE DESIGNED A STRUCTURE THAT COSTS US IN ADDITION TO NOT PROVIDING ANY DIGNITY THE PERSON AND VIOLATING THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE THAT. PERSON WHO IS PRODUCING IS. PARTICIPATING LABOR SHOULD BE COMPENSATED FOR THAT LABOR SO I- I WELCOME THIS CONVERSATION AND AS I SAID I'M VERY VERY. PLEASED IF YOU'RE WILLING TO BE A STRONG COLLECTOR YES. YES SENATOR MOORLACH. JUSTIN ACCOUNTING QUESTION. HE USED TO BE A TREASURER OF A SUMMER CAMP SO WE LOOK AT THE WHOLE. PACKAGE PAPER WORK BUT YOU ALSO HAD HOUSING AND MEALS. AND I'M JUST WONDERING HOW HOW DOES HOUSING AND MEALS FIT INTO THE EQUATION AND WITH THAT BE PART OF THE FACTOR OF WHY. THE HOURLY RATES ARE SO LOW IN THE COUNTRY BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE HISTORY OF IT. BUT A THING SENATOR BERNIE AND MAY MENTION THE HISTORY. EARLIER WHICH IT GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE- MATH MASON POCKET WE'RE SITTING IN THE REPORT THAT THAT EVEN THE WAGES HAVE GONE DOWN SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE SO I'M I'M. BY THE WAY TO THE BOND ALLEN IS WILL WITHIN THE PRISON SYSTEM BECAUSE MOST OF THE SERVICES THAT HAVE GONE DOWN FOR PRISONERS IN CALIFORNIA PRISON. IN IN THE IN CDC HAVE GONE DOWN AS WELL A MAJORITY OF THE BUDGET WHICH IS QUITE LARGE AS YOU ALL KNOW. GOES TO STAFF AND SERVICES IN THE UNION XIN IS AN OLDER ENGINES IN THE UNION HAS BECOME VERY STRONG THE LAST THIRTY YEARS. AND THEY'VE CREATED AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WEALTH OFF THE BACK TO THE PEOPLE WHO SUFFERED FROM THAT IS THE PEOPLE THAT ARE INSIDE WHEN I FIRST CAME TO PRISON. EVERYBODY HAD SOME TYPE OF PAIN NUMBER WERE YOU WOULD COMPENSATE EVEN A SMALL AMOUNT THAT YOU. THE THAT THEY HAVE NOW NOW VIRTUALLY NOBODY GETS COMPENSATED THIS IS LIKE A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE IN PRISON AND ACTUALLY GET PAID EVEN AT THE TEN CENTER TWENTY CENTS. AN HOUR- TYPE OF LABOR WAITED SO THE SERVICE IN COPLEY GONE DOWN FOR US IN REFERENCE TO REHABILITATION SERVICES JOBS PAY X. THAT ARE. OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE THE STAFF- MY GONE UP SO THERE'S A BIG IMBALANCE BETWEEN ACTUALLY WHAT IS BEING DELIVERED TO US AND FORMER SERVICES. FIRST ACTING TO- THE ADMINISTRATION SEES ITSELF- BUT THE HISTORY I MEAN THAT'S SPEAKS FOR ITSELF START WITH THE BILL COLIN TO BE ABLE TO- FIND A PERSON CONVICTED OF A CRIME THEN LEASING THEM OUT FOR. A SLAVE LABOR SO TO SPEAK IN SMALL WAGES- AND IT'S CONTINUE ON. TO THE ENACTMENT THIRTEEN THE MEMBER OF PEOPLE TO. ACTUALLY PUT IS INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE. BECAUSE WE'VE COMMITTED A CRIME AND WE THINK THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY. THE VISIT SOMETIME SOON- AND NOW THE COLORADO LEAD. IN INNOVATION IN THIS AREA MORE THAN CALIFORNIA. CENTER THANK YOU FOR GROWTH YOU KNOW THANKS FOR LETTING ME JUST TESTS AND QUIZZES AS A COMEDIAN APPRECIATED RIGHT AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASK WHEN YOU DO SO FINE I OTHERWISE I WAS GOING TO GO TO SENATOR MITCHELL RESULTING FOR OKAY GREAT CENTER MITCHELL. I WAS JUST GONNA REPLY ALSO TO OUR COLLEAGUES QUESTION I AND I GET THE LOGIC OF THE CORRELATIONS THAT WE CHARGE PEOPLE FOR SOME OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH INCARCERATING THEM AND THAT WASN'T THE DESIGN. IN IT. GOES BACK TO THE CHAIN GANGS THAT THERE IS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND AND I AM OPEN TO BE CORRECTED THERE IS NO CORRELATION WE DON'T DRAW DOWN ANY OF THEIR SALARY RE DIRECTED TO- COVERING THEIR EXPENSES LIKE FOR EXAMPLE FOR JUVENILES WHERE WE ACTUALLY CHARGE FEES ARE USED TO BEFORE BILL PASSED ON TO THEM TO COVER THEIR INCARCERATION THE PAYMENT IS NOT A CORRELATION AT ALL- IT IT AND SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THE COST THAT WOULD BE BORN IN INCREASING THE PAYMENT WOULD COME OUT OF THE PROFIT EARNED BY DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS FOR FAILING FURNITURE TO THE STATE OF THE GRAVITY THE LENSES FOR MEDI CAL FOR GLASSES. THERE IS A PROFIT EARNED OFF OF- THAT THAT LABOR AND THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A CORRELATION BETWEEN INMATE EARNINGS PAIN AGAINST THEIR EXPENSES FOR BEING INCARCERATED THAT WAS NEVER THE DESIGN I THINK THAT FOR ME THAT THAT'S THE RUB THAT IT'S NOT AS IF THEY ARE PAYING FOR THEIR BOARD A IT KEEP IF YOU WILL. IT IS A PROFIT POINT. AND THEREIN LIES THE INAPPROPRIATENESS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. CENTER BRADFORD UNIT CLOSE I THINK WE CAN GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY CLOSER I THINK- DISCUSSIONS BEEN A GREAT CLOSER AND I WAS ASKED EARLIER WHY IS THIS RESOLUTION AND I WAS HESITANT TO A RESOLUTION I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED A BILL BUT WE UNDERSTAND JUST ON SOME DISCUSSION WE HEARD I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST STEP AND I THINK THE DIALOGUE IN THE DISCUSSION ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS ISSUE. IS OR WHY THIS RESOLUTION IS HERE TODAY AND I THINK IT'S NEEDED BUT IF WE AS LEGISLATORS ONLY LEGISLATE FROM WHAT WE SEE IN FRONT OF US RIGHT NOW AND NOT GO BACK TO HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE HOW WE GOT HERE WE'RE GONNA MISS THE POINT AND HOW WE GOT HERE IS BECAUSE OF SLAVERY. AND ABOVE- ABOLISHMENT OF SLAVERY AND THE THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT BUT WE DON'T KNOW THAT HISTORICAL CONTENT WE CAN SAY WELL WHY SHOULD WE PAY ON THAT ALL AGAIN NO ONE SHOULD BE FORCED TO WORK FOR FREE AND THE INDIVIDUALS WERE IN PRISON CHOOSE TO WORK. BECAUSE THEY COULD STAY IN THEIR CELL EVERY DAY INTO I'M NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING BUT THE CHOOSE THE WORK BUT THEY SHOULD BE PAID FOR THE WORK THAT THEY DO. AND. IN THE DOLLARS BUT THE SAME TIME THEY'VE SHOULDN'T GET RICH OFF OF IT EITHER BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU SHOULD. PROVIDING INDIVIDUAL WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO ONE LIVE IN DIGNITY. AND HAS WASH MONSTER SAYS LEAVE A INSTITUTION WITH SOME SENSE OF. MONEY IN YOUR POCKET BECAUSE TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS IN A BUS VEERED DOESN'T GET YOU ANYTHING AND HAVE SOME OPPORTUNITY TO RESTART A LIFE AND WE JUST HEARD JUST PART OF THIS ABOUT THE RECIDIVISM AND THE WALLS IN THE FEARS OF INCREASED CRIME HERE IN CALIFORNIA WILL KEEP RELEASING FOLKS WITH NO MONEY IN THEIR POCKET WHAT ELSE THEY'RE GOING TO DO THEY'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO WHAT GOT THEM IN PRISON. AND THIS IS HOPING WITH WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ADDRESSING ALL THAT SYSTEMIC CAUSES OF CRIME THIS IS OE OF THE WAYS THAT WE HELP IN RECIDIVISM SO IT'S A COMMONSENSE MEASURE. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I'VE. ALRIGHT WITH THAT WILL TAKE A ROLL CALL AND THE MOTION IS TO PASS. BE ADOPTED TO APPROPRIATIONS OKAY. SKINNER USUAL MOTION BUT- I CAN I MOORLACH WITH THE WITH WHATEVER CO AUTHORS MISTER BRADFORD ONCE ADD MORE LYE FINE. BRADFORD OUR BRADFORD AYE JACKSON JACKSON AYE MITCHELL MITCHELL I'M AROUND. WIENER ALL RIGHT WIENER AYE. RIGHT THE BILL IS OUT AND THANK YOU SO MUCH AND CENTER BRADFORD YOU HAVE ANOTHER BILL JEFFERSON THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I'M HERE TO PRESENT AS J. R. TEN WHICH CALL FOR CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO ENACT LEGISLATION WHICH WOULD REMOVE CANNABIS FROM THE FEDERAL DRUG SCHEDULE UNDER CURRENT LAW CANNABIS REMAINS WILL SET A SCHEDULE ONE DRUG ALONG WITH OTHER DRUGS SUCH AS HEROIN AND LSD. THIS CURRENT SYSTEM IS SERIOUSLY FLAWED OTDATED IT HAS IMPOSED SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO CALIFORNIA'S CANNABIS INDUSTRY CANADA'S HAS LIMITED HAS UNLIMITED POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE ESTABLISHED MEDICAL USES AND IS SAFE RELATIVE TO OTHER SUBSTANCES LISTED ON THE FOR PRO DRUG SCHEDULED SIMPLY MOVING CANNABIS TO A LESS RESTRICTIVE SCHEDULE WOULD NOT PROTECT EXISTING MEDICAL CANNABIS PROGRAMS NOR WILL PREVENT PEOPLE FROM BEING ARRESTED AND PUNISHED FOR USING CANNABIS FOR RECREATION PURPOSES REMOVING CALPERS FROM THE DRUG SCHEDULE WOULD ALLOW. SURGED FACILITIES TO DO REGULAR RESEARCH INTO THE FAX CANNABIS AND HELP YOUR AND APPROVAL AND SUCCESSFUL INDUSTRY FOR OUR STATE THIS RESOLUTION IS IMPROPER IS A PRO I PROGRESS STEP TOWARD. A MORE JUST STRUCK POLICY IN OUR CLASS REGARD THE. THANK YOU DO WE HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT GOOD MORNING GOING BACK IS FOR DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE IN SUPPORT.

ANY OTHER WITNESSES BY TO HAVE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MOVE THE RESOLUTION RIGHT SO WE HAVE THE RESOLUTION BEFORE US WE HAVE DISCUSSION. FOR YOU CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS IS AGAIN ONE OF THOSE ISSUES WHERE. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BEING BEHIND AND NOT IN STEP WITH STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY IS CREATING A VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCE FOR US TO LEGALIZED IN A WAY THAT REALLY PROTECTS PEOPLE SAFETY. AND IT ACHIEVES THE TYPE OF GOALS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE IN THE LEGALIZATION OF CANNABIS SO I APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING IT FOR US BEFORE US IN IF YOU WANT TO CLOSE. YES I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE AND JUST LIKE THE MEASURE PREVIOUS MEASURE ALL WE'RE HERE. BECAUSE OF A RACIST POLICY IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES. THE ONLY REASON CANNABIS WAS EVER MOVE TO A SCHEDULE ONE WAS TO REST BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY THAT'S THE ONLY REASON BUT WE DON'T KNOW THE HISTORICAL ASPECTS OF THAT. CANNABIS HAVE BEEN USED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. HELP. YOU NAME IT BUT NOT UNTIL THE EARLY LATE NINETEEN TWENTIES. WAS THERE THE MOVE TO HOW DO WE INCARCERATE BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE HOW DO WE CARTER GREAT CARS READ AGAIN PEOPLE WHO WORK NOW FREE PEOPLE WERE NOW MIGRATING TO THIS COUNTRY AND THAT'S THE HISTORY BUT AGAIN WE CONSTANT LEGISLATE FROM WHERE WE ARE TODAY AND NOT LOOK AT HISTORICAL ASPECTS AGAIN. CANNABIS IS A PLANT I DRUG IS SOMETHING MAN MADE WE DID NOT CREATE THIS PLANT WE INVITE OF ENHANCE IT TO HORTICULTURE AND IN SCIENCE BUT. WHAT WE EVER DISCOVERED IT IT WOULD STILL BE ON THIS PLAN. SO A DRUGS HEROIN A DRUGS COCAINE A DRUG IT'S ALL THOSE THINGS NOW THAT PEOPLE WANNA SAVE SOCIETY FROM AND HAVE REHABILITATION AND CANNABIS IS BEEN AROUND SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME.
