PROVIDING A PROMISING PRACTICES THAT REGION'S CAN USE TO PROMOTE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES THROUGH THEIR LEGALLY MANDATED PLANNING PROCESS SEES. AN EXISTING STATE PARKS THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. AND WITH SIMILAR APPROACHES. MUCH OF THIS WORK IS OFTEN CONTAIN THROUGH MULTI AGENCY ACTION PLANS THAT INCLUDE QUANTITATIVE GOALS AND METRICS TO ADVANCE POSITIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES FROM I'M GOING STATE ACTIVITIES. SINCE TWENTY TEN HYPE IS ABOUT TWELVE ACTION PLANS THAT ADDRESS HOUSING TRANSPORTATION FOOD PARKS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF HEALTHY COMMUNITIES -- EACH OF THESE IS ENDORSED BY THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNSEL AT THE COUNCIL'S PUBLIC MEETINGS AND STAFF PROVIDE PROGRESS UPDATES IN THIS PUBLIC FORUM AT LEAST TWICE PER YEAR.

MOST RECENTLY THE HEALTH AND ALL POLICIES TEAM HAS RESPONDED TO REQUESTS FOR MULTIPLE AGENCIES FOR ASSISTANCE IN BUILDING THEIR CAPACITY TO BETTER BETTER SERVE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND ADDRESS INSTITUTIONALIZED RACISM AND DISPROPORTIONATE ALREADY.

WHICH IS SUPPORTING TWO HUNDRED STATE EMPLOYEES AND LEADERS ACROSS NINETEEN DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES TO EXAMINE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS OF THEIR PROGRAMS AND PRACTICES. I UNDERSTAND THE HISTORY OF INSTITUTIONALIZED RACISM IN CALIFORNIA AND DEVELOP ACTION PLANS TO TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND INEQUITIES IN THEIR OWN. PROGRAMS. I AM USING RESULT BASED ACCOUNTABILITY WERE DEVELOPING GOALS TIME LINES AND QUANTIFIABLE PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR THIS WORK. AS WE LOOK FORWARD THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL WILL CONTINUE -- TO AS TO DEVELOP THE HEALTH AND ALL POLICIES TEAM IT WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY WITH THESE POSITIONS BEING STATE FUNDED TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE STRATEGICALLY ALIGNED. WITH OUR WORK AT THE COUNCIL AND THE BROADER GOALS OF THE STATE. AND IN PARTICULAR WE'RE LOOKING WE WILL BE CONTINUING THE CARE CAPITAL COHORT AS I MENTIONED NINETEEN DEPARTMENTS CAN ARE CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING. AND WE HAVE AT LEAST NINE OTHER DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE LOOKING TO DO -- SORRY SEVEN OTHER DEPARTMENTS LOOKING TO START IN THE FUTURE. WERE SABOTAGING IN IMPLEMENTING STATE LEVEL METRICS AND INDICATORS TO TRACK PROGRESS -- AND WE WILL BE DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO EVALUATE THIS WORK AND AND AND IT'S SALAS ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS WE CAN DOCUMENT PROGRESS THROUGH OUR REGULAR COUNCIL MEETINGS AND IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND THEN WE WILL CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT OUR ON GOING ACTION PLANS. INCLUDING DEVELOPING DATA AND MAPPING TOOLS TO IDENTIFY URBAN HEAT ISLANDS TREE CANOPY AN OVERLAY WITH THE DISADVANTAGE OF VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AS PART OF OUR PARKS IN TREE CANOPY WORK.

SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE. HERE THIS AFTERNOON WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU ALL HAVE. THANK YOU FINANCE. AT TEN WEBER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ADMINISTRATION SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL. HELPING A POLICIES AS SHOWN SUCCESS -- IN COURT EIGHT WHAT WAS THE AGENCIES TO IMPROVE HEALTH AND CALL AND EQUITY THAT WE BELIEVE THESE RESOURCES WILL OUT TASK FORCE TO CONTINUE FEATURES SUCCESS AS DESCRIBED BERMAN. LL. A QUESTION ONE OF THE STAFF WAS STAFF LOSER GRANT FROM THE FOUNDATION THAT FUNDED THEM. IT THE INITIAL INVESTMENT WAS ALWAYS INTENDED TO BE A PROOF OF CONCEPT AND FROM THE BEGINNING THE UNDERSTANDING WITH THE FOUNDATIONS HAD BEEN THAT ULTIMATELY THESE PROGRAMS WILL BE TAKEN IN AS A STATE FUNDED MISSION. WAS REALLY INTENDED TO BE A PROOF OF CONCEPT AND SO THE FOUNDATIONS ARE VERY PLEASED WITH THE SUCCESS. HI UP IS ACHIEVED TO DATE AND FEEL THAT IT'S TIME TO START TRANSITIONING THAT WORK IN TO THE STATE STRUCTURE. HAVE ANY OF THE SGC HEALTH IN EQUITY GOALS. MISSED THE RESULT WILL POLICY DIRECTION OF THE LEGISLATURE -- YEAH I CAN SPEAK TO THAT I I THINK THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE WORK THAT WE HAVE DONE IS HELPING INDIVIDUAL DEPARTMENTS FULFILL THEIR MANDATES MANY OF WHICH ARE LEGISLATIVE SUCH AS PROMOTING. HEALTH AND EQUITY CO BENEFITS THROUGH THE CLIMATE CHANGE INVESTMENTS AND SO WE'VE DONE QUITE A LOT OF WORK ACROSS GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WITH THEIR INVESTMENTS WE'VE. SUPPORTED HEALTH AND EQUITY APPROACHES IN OVER TWO BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF GRANT MAKING OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. THERE ARE ALSO SOME SPECIFIC EXAMPLES WHERE THE HEALTH AND ALL POLICIES TASK FORCE THROUGH A PUBLIC INPUT PROCESS. I IDENTIFIED RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THEN WERE TURNED INTO LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS THAT WE'VE AND HELPFUL FELL AND SO ONE OF THOSE IS THE EXAMPLE THAT LOUISE SHARED AROUND BRINGING A HEALTH AND EQUITY PERSPECTIVE TO THE SEATS REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION GUIDELINES. THAT WAS RECOMMENDED BY THE PUBLIC THE IDEA WAS SHARED THROUGH HEALTHAND ALL POLICIES AND THEN THERE WAS LEGISLATION PASSED AFTER THAT HAPPENED THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION. APPROACH THE HEALTH AND ALL POLICIES TEAM AND ASK FOR OUR ASSISTANCE WITH IMPLEMENTATION. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MR. TO ASK YOU TO JUST RESPOND TO THE STAFF COMMENTS. ABOUT THE POSITIONS NOT HAVING ONGOING VALUE. THE BCP NOT INCLUDING ANY CONCRETE EXAMPLES OF FUTURE WORKLOADS TO JUSTIFY EXTENDING THE EFFORTS OF STATE RESOURCES JUST RESPOND. TO TO WHAT WAS LAID OUT BY STAFF. YEAH I MAY THINK THAT THE SPRING FINANCE LETTER OUTLINES A NUMBER OF SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES THAT WE WILL -- FOR PHIL I THINK OVER AT WE'VE DEVELOPED WE ALSO HAVE A HAND THAT WE CAN PROVIDE WE PROVIDED TO STAFF OF A NUMBER OF THE OUTCOMES THAT HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED OVER THE PAST AND WHERE WE'RE LOOKING IN THE COMING YEAR. AND AND YEARS AHEAD I THINK THE FOCUS REALLY IS A LOT ON THE GOVERNMENT ALLIANCE AND RACIAL RACE IN EQUITY WORK. A CONTINUING TO ASSIST DEPARTMENTS IN DOING THE CONCRETE REALIZATION OF HEALTH IN EQUITY OUTCOMES IN PROGRAMMATIC WORKING GRANT GUIDELINES -- AND THEN REALLY A STRONG FOCUS ON MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES AND PROGRESS TRACKING TO INFORM THE WORK GOING FORWARD.

THANK YOU WE'RE THE WHOLE THIS ITEM OPEN SO NEXT MONDAY ITEM NUMBER THREE PRECISION MEDICINE CHECK UBER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON KATE GORDON ON THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH. AND IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE TO TALK ABOUT OUR PRECISION HEALTH AND MEDICINE WORK FOR CALIFORNIA AND JOINED BY ELIZABETH BACHA WHO RUNS THAT PROGRAM. THE CALIFORNIA INITIATIVE TO ADVANCE PRECISION MEDICINE HAS GROWN FROM ITS INCEPTION BOB WAS ANNOUNCED IN THE STATE OF THE STATE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN IT FROM A THREE MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM TO A FIFTY THREE MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM. STILL THE ONLY ONE OF ITS KIND REPRESENTING REALLY UNIQUE PARTNERSHIPS IN THE STATE BETWEEN THE STATE. ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS NONPROFITS AND INDUSTRY PARTNERS. THE PROGRAM SINCE ITS INCEPTION HAS BEEN A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM WITH INITIAL YEARS -- GRANTS GOING TO UC SANTA CRUZ AND UCSF FOR DEMONSTRATION PROGRAMS AND PRECISION MEDICINE. IN THE SECOND YEAR OF ITS INCEPTION WITH AN ADDITIONAL TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDS SIX MORE PROJECTS AWARDED SUTTER YOU UC DAVIS CHAUDHRY CEDAR SINAI. UCSF AGAIN AND UC IRVINE IRVINE. THE NEXT YEAR ANOTHER TEN MILLION ADDED WITH SOME STANFORD UC SAN DIEGO AND USE YES SOUTH. ADDED AS PARTNERS. IN STATURE THAN I DO HAVE COPIES OF THE STATUTE WITH ME -- IF YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE THEM. THE PROGRAM IS ESTABLISHED WITH OPR THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH HAVING THE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PROGRAM IN A COUPLE OF IMPORTANT THINGS IN THE STATUTE ONE IS. THE STATUTE GIVES OPR THE AUTHORITY TO CONTRACT OUTSIDE OF A PR FOR ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM. AND ON THE THIS STATUTE ALSO REQUIRES THAT GRANTS THE COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM HAVE SOME I GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY SO INCLUDE BOTH SOUTHERN AND NORTHERN -- GRANTEES WHICH I THINK WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED VERY WELL. BUT WITHIN THAT PROGRAM AND HOW IT'S BEEN AROUND SINCE THE BEGINNING OPR HAS BEEN THE FISCAL AGENT OF THE PROGRAM WE UNDER AUTHORITY IN THE STATUTE DID CONTRACT WITH UCS UP AS THE LEAD TO ADMINISTER A FEES. WE ALSO CONTRACTED WITH UC AVIS I SINCE TWENTY EIGHTEEN AS A FINANCIAL OFFICER AND LAWRENCE BERKLEY LAB IS THE LEAD ON THE ASSET INVENTORY WHICH IS A STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS ARE THERE SEVERAL CONTRACTS THAT WE'VE DONE FOR MINISTRATION. OVER THE YEARS IN THIS PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM HAS GROWN AS I SAID FROM THREE MILLION INITIALLY TO FIFTY THREE MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM AND ONE THING THAT WE'VE DONE IT -- PR -- UNDER ELIZABETH DIRECTION -- IN THAT TIME AS THE PROGRAM'S GROWN IS TO REALLY LOOK AT WHAT I IS WORKING AND ISN'T WORKING IN THE POLICY FRAMEWORK WHAT DO WE NEED TO SUPPORT THE ON GOING INTERESTS ARE PRECISION MEDICINE AND HEALTH. IN THE STATE THROUGHOUT TWENTY EIGHTEEN IN THIS GROUP. HAS BEEN A A WIDE RANGING SORT OF STAKEHOLDER GROUP INCLUDING UCSF AND MANY OF THE OTHER ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS WE WORK WITH PATIENT EXPERT HELP THIS VERY EXPERTS FOUNDATIONS. THIS GROUP PUT TOGETHER REPORT THAT CAME OUT LAST YEAR THAT MADE UP SOME CENTRAL RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDING THE IT JUST TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF CROSS INDUSTRY AN INSTITUTION COLLABORATION TO REALIZE THE POTENTIAL. OF THIS PROGRAM ALSO. MADE THE POINT THAT THIS IS BEYOND ANY ONE INSTITUTION. THIS GROUP OF WIDER STAKEHOLDERS DID MAKE A RECOMMENDATION LAST YEAR THAT THE PROGRAM MOVED OUT OF ITS CURRENT POSITION IN THE STATE IN INTO MORE OF AN INDEPENDENT INSTITUTE. THAT PROPOSAL WAS REJECTED LAST YEAR BY THE LEGISLATURE SO AFTER THAT PROPOSAL WAS REJECTED THE PROGRAM REVERTED TO ITS PLACE WITHIN THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH WHERE IT IS NOW. I SHOULD SAY THAT -- WE LAST WEEK MET WITH OUR BROUGHT ADVISORY GROUP WHICH INCLUDES UCSF U. S. C. STANFORD UCLA UC SAN DIEGO UC DAVIS AND LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LAB. THIS ADVISORY GROUP ALL MET LAST WEEK OR YES WEDNESDAY OF LAST WEEK AND HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY SUPPORTIVE OF IT YOU KNOW THOUGH STILL I THINK. LIKE THE INSTITUTE CONCEPT HAVE BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE PROGRAM IN ITS CURRENT ITERATION AT AT PR -- AND THEY ARE FULLY STATE FULL STEAM AHEAD ON THE SUBSTANCE OF THE PROGRAM INCLUDING DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS -- THIS YEAR ON SOME REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUES FOR INSTANCE ACT REDUCING CANCER DISPARITIES IN UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS IS ONE OF THE KEY DEMONSTRATIONS THIS YEAR. OVERALL THESE FUNDS HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL FOR CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP WRONG PERSON HEALTH AND MEDICINE. HAVE ALREADY YIELDED BENEFITS ACROSS ALL OF THE YEARS THAT PROGRAM OF FUNDS HAVE BEEN GOING OUT TO THESE INSTITUTIONS. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TO CONTINUE THE PRO GRAHAM IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU SO MUCH WE LOOK FOR TO QUESTIONS THANK YOU FINANCE [inaudible] LL [inaudible] THE COMMITTEE. GOING OVER THE PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAU CHAIRMAN COOPER AND HIS LOVELY TO BE HERE WITH ALL OF THE REST OF YOU -- I SENT YOU MY LETTER SO YOU'LL BE RECEIVING IT BUT I'M GOING TO TAKE A QUICK GANDER AND AND RUN THROUGH IT. I AM SPEAKING TO YOU IS THE FOUNDER OF THE LATINO CANCER INSTITUTE BASED IN SAN JOSE CALIFORNIA AND A RECENT AWARD HE WITH THE STANFORD CANCER INSTITUTE OF THE CALIFORNIA INITIATIVE. TO ADVANCE PRECISION MEDICINE GRANT NOW I SPEAK HERE IS A COMMUNITY PARTNER. IN THIS ENDEAVOR AND I SPEAK AS A CANCER SURVIVOR WHO NOW SPEAKS FOR PEOPLE. WHO DON'T KNOW THEY HAVE A VOICE? I SPEAK AS A VETERAN TV JOURNALIST OF FORTY THREE YEARS WHO RECEIVED A LATINO SPIRIT AWARD FROM THE LATINO CAUCUS OF THIS. LATINO PLEDGES OF THIS CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE AND I SPEAK AS A CONCERNED CITIZEN WHO'S TAX PAIRED A DOLLARS FUND. IS VERY KEY INITIATIVE THAT CAN IMPACT ALL OF OUR HEALTH THAT OF OUR FAMILY OUR COMMUNITY AND IN FACT CALIFORNIA. THE LATINO CANCER INSTITUTE WORKS SPECIFICALLY AS A NATIONAL NETWORK OF LATINO CANCER SERVICE AGENCIES. TO DEVELOP AND SHARE BEST PRACTICE PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE ONE ADVANCED BY OUR CIA PM PROPOSAL TO COLLABORATE WITH RESEARCH. SUCH AS THE C. I. A. M. PROPOSAL DOES IN COLLABORATING WITH RESEARCH AND TO PROMOTE POLICIES THAT ACTUALLY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO DIMINISH EVEN ELIMINATE CANCER RISK IN THE LATINO COMMUNITY -- THESE ARE STEPS THAT WE HOPE TO DEMONSTRATE IN OUR SEE IBM OF FUNDED MODEL IN MONTEREY COUNTY WHICH WE WILL HOPE WILL INSPIRE STATEWIDE POLICY. MY ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN BRINGING THE ISSUE OF PRECISION MEDICINE TOWARD NETWORK OF RESEARCHERS AND CANCER ADVOCATES. FOR FEAR THAT MUCH OF OUR POPULATION EITHER CITIZEN OR UNDOCUMENTED WILL BE UNABLE TO UTILIZE THIS CUTTING EDGE MEDICINE DUE TO LACK OF KNOWLEDGE COST AND ACCESS. HENCE THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS WILL ONLY ENHANCE IT EXACERBATE DISPARITIES SUFFERED BY UNDER RESOURCE LOW INCOME AND LANGUAGE CHALLENGE COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. SUCH AS MONTEREY COUNTY WERE ONE IN FOUR LIVES IN POVERTY AND WHERE 50% OF THE POPULATION MAKES LESS THAN FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. NOW AS I UNDERSTAND UNDERSTOOD GOVERNOR BROWN'S MANDATE A WITH THIS INITIATIVE AND THE GOAL OF THE INITIATIVE. ALL CALIFORNIANS SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET PRECISION MEDICINE CARE WHEN NEEDED. OUR PROPOSAL IS MEANT TO DEMONSTRATE THAT AND PROVIDE A MODEL FOR THE STATE. I AM NOW CONCERNED. BECAUSE IT APPEARS TO ME THAT THERE IS SOME QUESTION ABOUT HOW THE CI A PM WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE UNDER WHOSE AUTHORITY. I HAD HOPED AS PROPOSED LAST YEAR THAT IT BECOME AN INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY SO THAT THE INTEREST OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA BE ADDRESSED FIRST AND FOREMOST. I HAD ALSO PLANNED TO CALL FOR COMMUNITY REPRESENTATION ON THAT AUTHORITY BOARD. IF THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE I ASK THAT THE CIA PM. AND IT'S FUNDING MANDATE STAY LOCATED IN AND OPERATED BY THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WHICH SHOULD WORK EQUALLY ACROSS SYSTEMS PARTNERSHIPS POWER BROKERS AND IN SOME CASES. THE HISTORICALLY POWERLESS I FURTHER ASKED THAT ANY ADVISORY COMMITTEE HAVE AT LEAST FOUR DIVERSE COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVES FROM NORTH SOUTH AND CENTRAL CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS WORLD REPRESENTATIVES. I FEAR THAT IF ANYONE INSTITUTION IS IN CHARGE THIS WILL ULTIMATELY COST CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS IN ORGANIZATIONS LIKE MINE. THE OPPORTUNITY HAVE A SAY IN WHAT WHERE AND HOW RESEARCH RELATED PRECISION MEDICINE QUESTIONS ARE DETERMINED AND STUDIED. AND PRACTICAL AS WELL AS SCIENTIFIC SOLUTIONS FOUND. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ANYONE OF YOU ANSWERING ANY ONE OF YOUR QUESTIONS I HOPE YOU RECEIVED MY EMAIL SOON. AND HAS MY PHONE NUMBER AND MY ADDRESS AND ALL THE PERTINENT DETAILS IN IT THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. THANK YOU. WE CONTINUE HAVE CONCERNS WITH HOW THIS DECISION TO MOVE THIS PROGRAM WAS MADE. GIVEN THE LEGISLATURE'S ACTION LAST YEAR RESPECT TO CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION IN BUDGET CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS TO ADOPT THE BUDGET BILLING WHICH REQUIRE THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO BECOME THE PROGRAM MINISTRY -- THE REMAINING FUNDING IS OUR MOTION. SO MOVED CAN I SAY JUST QUICKER ABSOLUTELY BOB THE SO I JUST WANT TO THANK EVERYONE WHO HAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS AND AS I'VE SAID I THINK EVERY YEAR THIS. BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE I'M A BIG SUPPORTER OF WHAT OUR STATE IS DOING AROUND. PRECISION MEDICINE AND IN PARTICULAR BIG SUPPORTER OF WHAT UCSF HAS BEEN DOING WHICH IS WIDE TO SUPPORT OF THE ASSEMBLY POSITION LAST YEAR AND I DO THINKTHAT IS. STILL THE WAY WE SHOULD GO AYE MY GUESS IS THIS WILL BE A DISCUSSION AND CONFERENCE BUT WITH THAT. I'M HAPPY. TO SUPPORT THE CHAIRMAN'S MEASURE BUT THIS IS AND NO WINS ANY INDICATION WITH REGARD TO THE WORK THAT I KNOW HAS BEEN DONE IN RECENT MONTHS ON THIS BY THE ADMINISTRATION. SO THAT A MOTION THAT IS A MOTION. MOVE A SECOND ROLL CALL PLEASE. COOPER HI TWO HI LACKEY NAZARIAN WICKS. OKAY LET'S MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER -- FOUR UNCLAIMED PROPERTY GOOD AFTERNOON -- CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS JENNIFER URBAN I'M WITH THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE. THE ISSUE BEFORE YOU INCLUDES TWO REQUESTS RELATED TO THE CLAIM PROPERTY PROGRAM. THE FIRST REQUEST IS FOR PERMANENT RESOURCES TO CONTINUE TO PERFORM AUDITS OF HOLDERS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE CALIFORNIA UNCLAIMED PROPERTY LAW. WHICH WILL RESULT IN INCREASED UNCLAIMED PROPERTY TO BE REUNITED WITH ITS RIGHTFUL OWNERS SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN THE SCO HAS BEEN APPROVED CONTINUATION OF THE SAME RESOURCES. ON A LIMITED TERM BASIS. THIS WORKLOAD IS ONGOING AND SUPPORTER WITH PERMANENT RESOURCES TO ENSURE HOLDERS CONTINUE TO REPORT AND REMIT UNCLAIMED PROPERTY. TO SCO FOR THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF RETURNING TO ITS RIGHTFUL OWNER. THE RESOURCES WILL ALSO ASSIST HOLDERS IN CREATING UNCLAIMED PROPERTY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR IDENTIFYING AND REPORTING UNCLAIMED PROPERTY IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS. THE SERVER REQUEST IS FOR PERMANENT RESOURCES TO CONTINUE IDENTIFYING AND PREVENTING FRAUDULENT UNCLAIMED PROPERTY SUBMISSION. THE MISSION CLAIM FORMS FROM BEING PAID. IN TWO THOUSAND TEN ELEVEN U. P. D. IDENTIFY FRAUDULENT CLAIMS PAID ERRONEOUSLY TOTALING TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS WHICH INDICATED THAT MORE FRAUDULENT CLAIMS WERE BEING PAID OUT THE NEW PT WAS ABLE TO IDENTIFY. TO HELP REDUCE FRAUD THE S. YOU RECEIVED PERMANENT AND LIMITED TERM RESOURCES AND ESTABLISH THE FRAUDULENT CLAIMS PREVENTION AND DETECTION PROGRAM.

SO WE HAVE A QUORUM SO WE'LL WAIT TO VOTE ON THAT ITEM OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. THIS NEW ADDITION REVIVED THE OFFICE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION. SEE AN H.. AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. I'M MICHAEL WILL CONTAIN THE SPECIAL ADVISER ON INNOVATION AND DIGITAL SERVICES IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. I AM IN THE REQUEST BEFORE YOU. AND I HAVE WITHIN EIGHT JULIE LEE THE UNDERSECRETARY OF THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY. THE REQUESTED FOR YOU IS FOR THIRTY SIX POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS AND FIFTY POSITIONS IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY AND FOURTEEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING TO ESTABLISH AN OFFICE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION. WHERE'S THE PREACHER OF THE SUPPORT FOR THE CONCEPT IN THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION. I THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT WE'RE NOT MEETING THE EXPECTATIONS OF CALIFORNIANS. ARE CONTINUING TO FALL FURTHER BEHIND AND THAT IS THE RISK OF THE STATUS QUO. OUR CONCERN IS WITH THE PROPOSED SIZE OF THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION AND THE REMOVAL OF THE PROCUREMENT AUTHORITY. AND WHAT THE REQUEST IS TRYING TO DO IS IS -- REALLY A CULTURAL SHIFT IN THE WAY THAT STATE GOVERNMENT OPERATES. TO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE WAY THE INFORMATION SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO CALIFORNIANS. A SHIFT FROM FOCUSING ON PROGRAMS AND DEPARTMENTS TO PEOPLE. ABOUT THOSE THAT ARE UTILIZING GOVERNMENT SERVICES. AND THOSE THAT ARE PROVIDING THE SERVICES. AND THIS IS PART OF AN INTERNATIONAL SHIFT THAT STARTED WITH THE U. K. DIGITAL SERVICE AS REPRESENTED IN THE THE U. S. BY THE US DIGITAL SERVICE IN EIGHTEEN HALF. WHICH IS AT AN OFFICE OF THE GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION. THIS FOCUSES ON A TEAM BASED APPROACH MULTI DISCIPLINARY TO TACKLE COMPONENTS AND JUST AS AS WE LEARN AND TEST WITH USERS. WE NEED DESIGNERS HER WELL VERSED IN USER EXPERIENCE SOFTWARE ENGINEERS PRODUCT MANAGERS AND BUREAUCRACY HACKERS. THE CONCEPT IS TO PARTNER WITH THE DEPARTMENTAL STAFF AND IN FACT TO INCLUDE DEPARTMENTAL STAFF IN THE OFFICE. WE HAVE EXPERIENCE HIRING STAFF AND WE CAN BRING THIS OFFICE UP QUICKLY. FUNDAMENTALLY WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT AT THE BEGINNING IS TO HAVE THE RIGHT LEADER. WE HAVE A NETWORK OF ADVISORS THAT INCLUDES ALL OF THE TOP PEOPLE DOING THIS RIGHT NOW INTERNATIONALLY. WE'RE GETTING RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THOSE FOLKS FOR THE RIGHT PERSON TO LEAD THIS OFFICE. THAT PERSON THOUGH NEEDS TO BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO HAVE IMPACT ON HOW CALIFORNIA OPERATES. AND THEY NEED TO SUFFICIENT SIZE OFFICE IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE NEED TO HAVE MULTIPLE TEAMS. START TO DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL AND GENERATE ENTHUSIASM AND BY AND THE PROJECTS WILL BE SELECTED ONCE WE HAVE THE DIRECTOR. THE ONE THAT'S THAT'S MENTIONED IN THE AGENDA IS NOT ONE THAT WE WOULD START WITH WHICH IS D. M. V. WAIT TIMES AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS WE ALREADY HAVE AN EFFORT UNDER WAY WITH. WITH THE DMV SO WE HAVE A STRIKE TEAM THERE WE HAVE A LOT OF OF DIFFERENT CONSULTANTS AND THEY'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS THE THE WAIT TIMES. THIS OFFICE ISN'T GOING TO BE UP UNTIL MID FALL IS MY MY BEST GUESS RIGHT NOW. AND BY THEN WE NEED TO BE WAY DOWN THE ROAD WITH THE ENVY ADDRESSING DMB WAIT TIMES. THERE MAY WILL BE ASPECTS OF THE DMV THAT THIS OFFICE CAN ADDRESS AS IT COMES UP BUT I WOULDN'T WANT THIS TO BE THAT THE FOCUS OF THE OFFICES I AS IT COMES UP FINANCE. TED RATE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL AS BUDGETED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. L. L.. BRENT METZ KALEO WE RAISE A NUMBER OF ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION AT THE LAST HEARING ON THIS ISSUE -- WE WILL RAISE THEM AGAIN IN THE INTEREST OF TIME -- BUT WE DID WANT TO NOTE THAT IF THE SUBCOMMITTEE DOES ADOPT THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION THAT THE LEGISLATURE -- MAY WANT TO CONSIDER HOW BEST TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OF THE OFFICES ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS TO EVALUATE ITS EFFECTIVENESS GOING FORWARD THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE. ARE GOING UP ON A PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE. KEVIN KILLING DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR INTERNET ASSOCIATION WE'RE HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S REQUEST. CALIFORNIANS EXPECT INTERACT WITH GOVERNMENT THROUGH DIGITAL CHANNELS INCLUDING WEBSITES EMAIL MOBILE APPLICATIONS. BY BUILDING DIGITAL SERVICES THAT MEET THEIR NEEDS CALIFORNIA TO MAKE THE DELIVERY OF OUR POLICY IN PROGRAMS MORE EFFECTIVE. THE OFFICE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION WILL USE AN INCREMENTAL FAST PACED STYLE OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TO REDUCE THE RISK OF FAILURE OF THESE PROJECTS. THE GOAL TO GET SOFTWARE INTO USERS HANDS EARLIEST POSSIBLE GIVE THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM OPPORTUNITIES TO ADJUST BASED ON USER FEEDBACK ABOUT THE SERVICE. WE AGREE THE HEAD COUNT FIFTY IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE CROSS FUNCTIONAL TEAMS WITH A VARIETY OF EXPERIENCE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS. SO WE SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S REQUEST AND THINK THE ASSEMBLY FOR ANY SUPPORT IT CAN PROVIDE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF ROB GROSS BECAUSE REPRESENTING AMAZON -- TODAY WOULD LIKE TO LEARN MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE INTERNS ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS MR WILKENING AND CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR NEW POSTER -- AMAZON AS YOU KNOW MISTER CHAIR IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST CUSTOMER OBSESSED COMPANIES AND CUSTOMER OBSESSION IS SOMETHING THAT WE THINK THIS STATE -- HAS BEEN LACKING IN CERTAIN AREAS AND SO THIS INITIATIVE IS SOMETHING THAT WERE QUITE SUPPORTIVE OF AND BELIEVE THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE GOOD WORK WHAT DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY IS CURRENTLY DOING THE WORKING ON MAJOR IT SYSTEMS. VERY SIGNIFICANT THINGS THIS OFFICE IS FOCUS IN A DIFFERENT MANNER AND THAT'S PROVIDING SERVICES TO CALIFORNIANS THE CONSTITUENTS. AND WE THINK ULTIMATELY THAT IF YOU HAVE BETTER DELIVERY TO CONSTITUENTS YOU'RE ACTUALLY GONNA SEE SOME SAVINGS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I KNOW IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO HAVE SUCH A DYNAMIC ANALYSIS ASSOCIATED. WHEN CUSTOMERS EXPECT TO BE CONNECTING THE OTHER MOBILE DEVICES AND THAT'S OUR ONLY ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT THEY DON'T HAVE VACCINATIONS THEY DON'T HAVE DESKTOPS I MEAN IT WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AFTER THAT LENDS IN OUR OPINION? AND WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THIS WE ALSO AGREE AND APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THERE'S RISK ASSOCIATED. BUT IN ORDER TO MAKE THE SUCCESSFUL WE DO BELIEVE AS WELL THAT THE FIFTY POSITIONS THE AMOUNT THAT THE MINISTRATION HAS REQUESTED IS NECESSARY TO GET THAT STARTED. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU. THE GOAL IS PROPOSAL MAKES SENSE BUT THE POLLS EXECUTION IS RUSHED. WE WANT TO SEE THIS OFFICE START OFF A STRONG FOUNDATION AND GROW OVER TIME. IF YOU CAN DEMONSTRATE THE VALUE YOUR PROMISING YOU HAVE NO PROBLEM RECEIVE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FROM US IN FUTURE YEARS. SO AS FAR AS A RECOMMENDATION GOES WE'RE GONNA PROVE THE TEMP POSITION FOR THE OFFICE OF THIS REALIZATION. RUN APPROVED TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR GENERAL FUND BEGIN INNOVATION REVOLVING FUND.

FINANCE AMAZON WERE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I JUST WANNA MAKE ONE COMMENT QUICKLY ABOUT.

THANK YOU FINANCE I'M SORRY L. L.. QUESTION THE COMMITTEE MISTER. TO SUFFERS ONE MORE THANK EVERYONE FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS SO -- A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS -- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT IS THE ADEQUATE SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF FUNDING THAT WE NEED IN THIS AREA. AND I'M WONDERING IF THE ADMINISTRATION IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN HOW YOU GOT AT THE NUMBER THAT YOU DID WHY YOU THINK THAT IS SUFFICIENT. AND GIVEN TO THE RECOMMENDATION IS ABOUT EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS SHORT OF WHAT THE MAJOR CBO SENSES COLLISION IS LOOKING. FOR HELP US UNDERSTAND. KIND OF HOW YOU GOT TO THIS NUMBER AND I'M NOT. I AM NOT SAYING ONE WAY THE OTHER WHICH IS THE RIGHT NUMBER BUT I WOULD ASK ALL PARTIES TO REALLY HELP US UNDERSTAND HOW WE JUSTIFY THE PROPER LEVEL FUNDED HERE. YET I MEAN THAT IS THE ULTIMATE QUESTION AT THE END OF THE DAY HUNDRED WHY FORTY MILLION DOLLARS OR TWO HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION. RIGHT WHAT IS THE RIGHT NUMBER AT THE END OF THEDAY AND TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. PRETTY FRANKLY IS I CANNOT TELL YOU WHAT A CORRECT NUMBER IS AND WE LOOKED AT AND HOW MUCH TO PROVIDE ON A PER HARD TO COUNT POPULATION BASIS. AND WHEN LOOKING AT THAT WE ARE HOVERING SOMEWHERE AROUND NINE TO TEN DOLLARS RIGHT NOW CURRENTLY -- ON A POLE HARD TO COUNT POPULATION BASIS ON HOW MUCH WE'RE SPENDING PER PERSON IF THAT IS THE RIGHT NUMBER. I CAN'T I I DON'T KNOW -- IT YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT OF OUTRAGE THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IS GOING TO BE BASED UPON A VARIETY OF FACTORS THAT YOU KNOW INCLUDING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE OUTREACH MATERIALS -- THE TRUSTWORTHINESS OF THE MESSENGERS FOR DELIVERING THOSE THINGS HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE -- TO REACH OUT AND CONNECT WITH THE HARD TO COUNT POPULATION IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THEY PARTICIPATE COMPLETELY IN THE UPCOMING CENSUS -- THIS IS NOT BEEN DONE ON THIS LEVEL BEFORE -- AND WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH THESE VARYING -- POPULATION GROUPS AND ALL THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES THAT ARE NOW IN FRONT OF US RELATED TO THE CENSUS -- SO. I'M. TO MAKE OUT. YOU KNOW A LONG ANSWER SHORT I DON'T KNOW AND I CAN'T GIVE YOU A SPECIFIC ANSWER. AND THEN SOME AND I THIS NEXT QUESTION IS PROBABLY RELATED TO THAT BUT WE HAVE NO IDEA IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS WHETHER THE SUPREME COURT IS GOING TO COME DOWN AND UPHOLD THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION. CURIOUS WHAT SORT OF CONTINGENCY PLANNING THERE MIGHT BE. IF THE WORST CASE SCENARIO OCCURS AND HOW HOW ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT THAT. WELL AND AND MAYBE THE DIRECTOR LIKE TO CHIME IN A LITTLE BIT ON THIS I KNOW THAT SHE HAS MENTIONED BEFORE THAT YOU KNOW WE WE ARE PROCEEDING AS IF THE BILL IS ALREADY BEEN WRONG AND WE CAN'T HONORING IT SO WE ARE% PROCEEDING AS THOUGH PEOPLE. ARE ALREADY THINKING THAT IT'S GOING TO BE INCLUDED AND AND WE HOPE IT'S NOT ULTIMATELY BUT IF IT IS WE ALREADY HEADING DOWN THE PATH ASSUMING THAT IT'S GOING TO BE INCLUDED SO THAT WE CAN TRY TO COMBAT -- THAT QUESTION AND I PROVIDE THAT MESSAGING -- TO ARE HARD TO COME POPULATIONS SIMILAR THIS IS A LEVEL OF FUNNY THAT YOU THINK IS APPROPRIATE EVEN ASSUMING THAT THAT QUESTION COMES YEAH AT THIS POINT IN TIME WE THINK IT'S A WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING WE BELIEVE IS APPROPRIATE -- AS AS WE GO THROUGH THE SUMMER MONTHS WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING ON WHAT WE CALL OUR IMPLEMENTATION PLAN SO WE FUNDED ALL OF OUR PARTNERS OUT THERE -- AT VARYING LEVELS AND WE'RE GONNA BE CONVENING ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN I BELIEVE -- IMPLEMENTATION WORKSHOPS OVER THE COURSE OF THE SUMMER WERE WE GOING TO DRILL DOWN INTO MORE BRAIN YOUR LEVEL OF WHAT EXACTLY ARE THEY CAN BE DOING AND HOW ARE THEY SPENDING THAT MONEY. LIKE WHERE THEY CAN BE PLACING QUESTIONNAIRE ASSISTANCE CENTERS WHERE THEY CAN BE PLACING KIOSK HOW ARE THEY STAFF IN THOSE THINGS IN THIS IS THAT WE'RE GONNA BRING ALL OF OUR PARTNERS TOGETHER WHETHER IT'S THE COUNTIES -- ARE ADMINISTRATIVE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE STATEWIDE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION AS WELL AS OUR MEDIA CONTRACTOR THAT WE CAN SEE WHO'S DOING WHAT AND WHERE WE CAN PARTNER PEOPLE UP WHERE WE NEED. TO AND THEN WE'LL BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THAT POINT IN TIME WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE ANY AND ALL MISSIONS AND EVERYONE'S. PLANS IS THERE A PARTICULAR POPULATION GROUP IS THERE A PARTICULAR AREA IN THE STATE THAT WE SOMEHOW MISTER WE JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FUNDING TO REACH. UNFORTUNATELY WE WILL NOT KNOW THAT UNTIL WE GET TOWARDS THE END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR TOWARD SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER TIME FRAME. GOTCHA WELL JUST. TO CONCLUDE MY PERSPECTIVE -- I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE MINISTRATION AS WELL AS THE BUDGET COMMITTEES AND NOW SYSTEM THE NUMBER THAT THEY PUT OUT HERE. I CERTAINLY KNOW JUST WITHIN THE LAST DAY THEIR FAN. A NUMBER OF REACTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS THE RIGHT NUMBER -- I BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE REALLY BRINGS GOOD FAITH AND WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS FUNDED THE WAY IT OUGHT TO BE AND I THINK WHAT I WOULD ASK. ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN THIS BOTH THE ADMINISTRATION BUT ALSO THE STAKEHOLDERS IS TO HELP US UNDERSTAND HOW TO JUSTIFY WHAT IS THE RIGHT NUMBER BECAUSE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. I THINK THE ANSWER YOU GAVE IS ALSO QUESTION I WOULD POSE TO THE ADVOCATES OF LIKE WHAT IS THAT CORRECT NUMBER -- MY HOPE IS AS I SPOKE TO THE CHAIR EARLIER ABOUT THIS IS WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HOLD THIS ITEM OVER JUST BRIEFLY. TO GIVE A LITTLE TIME FOR THAT MAY TURN OUT THAT THE NUMBER THAT'S BEING PROPOSED IS THE RIGHT NUMBER -- AS SOMEONE WHO VERY MUCH WANTS AS I THINK WE ALL DO TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE COUNTING EVERYONE I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE GET IT RIGHT. I DO ALSO THINK THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF MISCOMMUNICATION ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE IN THIS COMMITTEE AND WHERE COMMUNICATIONS WENT TO AND MY HOPE IS THAT WE CAN JUST GET SOME FOLKS IN A ROOM AND JUST REALLY TALK IT OUT -- BEFORE WE GET TO A FINAL NUMBER BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT THE DOWNSIDE RISK OF OF NOT SPENDING ENOUGH FUNDS IS VERY VERY INTENSE AND SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT. IF THE WORST CASE SCENARIO COMES TO BE WE HAVE A CITIZENSHIP QUESTION ON THE CENSUS -- WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN A LOT OF COMMUNITIES I DON'T WANT US TO UNDER ESTIMATE WHAT WE NEED FOR THIS SO -- SO WITH THAT -- LOOK FOR TO FOR THE CONVERSATIONS AND AGAIN I KNOW THAT EVERYONE IS TRYING TO GET TO THE RIGHT NUMBER AND AND APPRECIATE THAT WORK. MISS WICKS. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN I JUST WANNA LET MYSELF WITH -- SEVEN NUMBER CHOOSE COMMENTS AS WELL AND ASKED THAT WE HAVE LEAVE THIS OPEN -- AT IMPORTANT ACCURATE COUNT IS CRITICAL FOR MANY MANY MANY REASONS -- I DO SHARE THE CONCERN OBVIOUSLY ON THE CITIZENS SHIP QUESTION I WANNA MAKE SURE WE GET TO THE RIGHT NUMBER I KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT TO FIGURE THESE THINGS OUT -- BUT WOULD ASK ALL EVERYONE ON HIS I THINK AGAIN WORKING ALL IN IN GOOD FACE. TO MAKE SURE WE GET THAT NUMBER RIGHT -- I THINK IT'S CAN BE VERY IMPORTS I TO ASK THAT WE LEAVE THIS OPEN. YEAH I HAVE A QUESTION REAL HOW MUCH OTHER STATES ARE SPENDING ON OUT REACH. I THINK THE MOST A MINNESOTA MIGHT BE PUTTING TWO MILLION I BELIEVE NEW YORK. AS THEY ASK FOR FORTY THINK THE ONLY PROOF TWENTY OKAY BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN HOW IT. CAME OUT THIS TWENTY YEAH. YEAH THAT'LL ADD I WANNA USE OF A NUMBER EARLIER NINE TO TEN BUCKS A VOTER. HER HEART ACCOUNT. FOR RESIDENTS BRITAIN AND WHAT IS THAT EVEN WITHOUT PLACE TO MINNESOTA THEY SPENDING. HALF THAT IS IT IS A SLIMMER HELLO READERS I DON'T HAVE THEIR DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION FROM ME TO DETERMINE REMEMBER SO WE USE CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA HARD ACCOUNT INDEX SO WE HAVE UNIQUE -- SPECIFIC INFORMATION RELATED TO WHAT MAKES YOU HARD TO COUNT IN CALIFORNIA AND THERE'S FOURTEEN VARIABLES THAT GOES INTO THAT NO WE OVERLY THOSE VERY OLD BALLS ON OUR POPULATION TO DETERMINE WHO IS CONSIDERED HARD ACCOUNT WITHIN THE STATE.

I'M YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WANTED TO PROP POINT OUT IN THE CENSUS OUT REACH HEARING. THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIA TO PRIORITIZE THEIR SMALLER LANGUAGE GROUPS -- THIS IS KEY AS THEY WILL BE FOR FURTHER MARGINALIZED WE SUPPORT THE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT OF FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR TRANSLATED MATERIALS BUT WE WOULD ASK THAT -- IT MAY NOT BE SO DEFINEDIS TRANSLATED MATERIALS WE HAVE THREE GROUPS THAT WE ARE PROTECT PRIORITIZING THE PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITY WHICH IS THE LARGEST IN CALIFORNIA OUTSIDE OF CASH -- HAWAII AND THEY HAVE ACTUALLY NO FEDERAL LANGUAGE SUPPORTS SO THAT WOULD MAKE THEM. ANYTHING DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO FILL OUT THE CENSUS -- ALSO ARE POPULATIONS THAT HAVE A LOWER LITERACY RATE SO THEY MAY NEED MATERIALS AT A LOWER LATE LITERACY RATE. AND MORE EMPHASIS ON A WRITTEN INDIGENOUS LANGUAGES THEY MAY GO BEYOND TRANSLATED MATERIALS TO AUDIO OR ILLUSTRATIONS SO AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN WHAT -- DETERMINES OUR OUTREACH I WOULD ASK THAT. THE LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN THE STATE CENSUS OFFICE AND LEGISLATURE REALLY PRIORITIZE THESE GROUPS WE ALSO ASK THAT SINCE SO HEAVILY -- REGIONAL CBO'S AT PLANS AND STATEWIDE CBO PLANS AND COUNTY PLANTS WILL MAKE THE MAJORITY OF THE STATE CENSUS OUTREACH EFFORTS THAT THOSE PLANS ACTUALLY BE COMPILED COMPILED SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. BECAUSE THIS WOULD GIVE THE LEGISLATURE KEY STAKEHOLDERS AND STATE CENSUS PARTNERS -- IN A WAY TO IDENTIFY THE GAPS AND START THAT GAP ANALYSIS SOONER. THANK YOU.

IN THAT -- WE CAN PROVIDE TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR HARD TO COUNT SCHOOLS THROUGH TWENTY FIVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AS YOU KNOW THERE'S EIGHTY SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY AREA. ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS ABOUT HALF OF THAT WOULD GO TO LA U. S. D..

AS YOU KNOW LOS ANGELES COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION IS THE LARGEST REGIONAL EDUCATION AGENCY IN THE NATION MOST OTHER -- COUNTY OFFICES EDUCATION ALSO PROVIDE REGIONAL A SERVICES TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND WE FEEL AS THOUGH WE WOULD BE THE BEST PLACE TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORTS AN OUT REACH.

I THINK AT THE NUMBER OF OF THE ISSUE IS CBO CERTAIN AND NONPROFITS IN CALIFORNIA ARE ALL IN -- TO HELP MAKE SURE THAT THE CENSUS COUNT IS DONE IN THE MOST ROBUST AND EFFECTIVE WAY THAT CALIFORNIA AND I THINK WE HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION ABOUT HOW MUCH IT WILL A COST. THOSE CBA'S TO CBO'S TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THAT AND HOW WHAT'S THE BRIDGE THE ALLOCATION OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT. THAT'S GIVEN TO CBO IS TO DO THIS WORK AND WE DO FEEL THAT WE HAVE A UNIQUE RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO BE A VITAL PARTNER. IN REACHING HARD TO COUNT RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA AND ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT WILL GET INTO THIS AND NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES WE NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND NOT HAVE A BACK UP PLAN -- FOR ORGANIZATIONS THAT WHOSE COMMITMENT WILL BE UNWAVERING BUT THE RESOURCES TO BE SUCCESSFUL BE LIMITED SO WE THANK YOU MISTER TRUMAN AS WAX FOR ASKING THAT WE EXTEND THIS CONVERSATION I WANT TO BE AS HELPFUL AS WE CAN GIVING THAT ANALYTICS DRIVING AREN'T UNDERPINNING OUR ESTIMATE. THANK YOU A QUESTION FOR YOU SO WHAT IS YOUR ESTIMATE ON THE COST WHAT IT SHOULD BE. WELL I ACTUALLY WANT TO JUST. TO LOOK MORE CLOSELY IF WE'RE USING A SIMILAR NUMBER OF SIXTEEN ASH SIXTEEN POINT TWO MILLION HARD TO COUNT CALIFORNIANS AND WE'RE SAYING IT'S SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SEVEN AND TWELVE DOLLARS AND THE STATE THE GOVERNOR'S. FOLKS ARE SAYING IT'S NINE AND TEN THEN THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S NOT INCLUDED IN THE TOTAL OR THE IS THE MEDIA OUR REACH INCLUDED IN A IN A DIFFERENT BUCKET I'M NOT SURE. THE QUESTION IS THE ALLOCATION OF WORKLOAD HERE AND WHAT THE RIGHT NUMBER FOR CBO IS INVOLVED IN THIS. EFFORT WOULD BE WELL IN TWO THOUSAND TEN WAS THE FIVE MILLION ON THE CENSUS RIGHT NOW AT A HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN MILLION. FOODS AND EVERYBODY IN HERE SOME FOLKS WOULD BE AT THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. SO THINGS ARE CHANGING WASHINGTON CRIME IS DIFFERENT. YOU NEED MORE BUT THAT'S A BIG BIG DIFFERENCE SO I DO NOT DISAGREE WITH USER YES WE'RE TRYING TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS IN HOW WE APPROACH THIS THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON NO F. ITEM WITH CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION. WHERE AN ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION WE SERVE FARMWORKERS AND I'M HERE TO SUPPORT PRIORITIZING ARE LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT COMMITTEES PARTICULIER INDIGENOUS FARMWORKER COMMUNITIES? 30% OF OUR FARMWORKERS ARE INDIGENOUS TO SPEAK A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN SPANISH MYSTICAL A TRICKY. AND THERE'S ANOTHER -- LANGUAGE BLOCKING YELLS AND THEY HAVE THEIR UNIQUE CHALLENGES THESE ARE NON WRITTEN AS WAS BEEN TESTIFIED BEFORE WHEN MAKE SURE THEY'RE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES ARE ALLOCATED TO THESE COMMUNITIES. THEY THETHEY HAVE THESE NEEDS AND ALSO TIED THE MEDIA ASPECT BECAUSE THEY WORK WITH MEDIA AND THAT'S A KEY PART AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES ADDRESS THERE. NOW. THE LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN IS SUPPOSED TO BE RELEASED AS WAS INFORMED AT THE INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON MAY SEVENTEENTH. HOWEVER WE DO NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT ON THAT LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN WE WOULD SUPPORT. A COMMENT PERIOD. THAT'S REASONABLE SO WE CAN LOOK AT IT PARTICULARLY SINCE OUR INDIGENOUS COMMUNITY. IS IN DANGER OF BEING LEFT OUT OF A ROBUST LANGUAGE ACCESS PLANTS WE MAKE SURE THAT'S INCLUDED. WE ALSO STAND IN SUPPORT WITH A C. PAN IN TERMS OF THE BUDGET ASK WE APPRECIATE THIS ITEM BEING HELD OPEN SO WE CAN REALLY. LOOK AT WHAT TYPE OF FUNDING IS NEEDED TO BE ADDRESSED. PARTICULARLY IN THIS TIME THAT'S THE CHAIR HAS. REFERRED AND THE OTHER COMMENTS AS WELL BY THE MEMBERS OF THE DANGEROUS CLIMATE THAT ARE IMMIGRANT COMMUTERS ARE FACING THROUGH FEAR INTIMIDATION AND COERCION MORE RECENTLY AS WHAT WHAT DONE WITH THE PUBLIC CHARGE ISSUE OVER THE WEEKEND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IF YOU'RE NOT I MEAN IT'S NOT TO KNOW WHAT CHILDREN NOW WE'RE ALSO A NUMBER OF C. PAN AND CHILDREN NOW'S INTEREST AND AND FOR OUR PARTNERS FIRST. FIVE ASSOCIATION WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ENSURING THAT COMMUNITIES KNOW THAT THEY NEED TO COUNT THEIR INFANTS AND THEIR BABIES -- OVER. HE LARGE NUMBER OF CHILDREN AND INFANTS WERE NOT COUNTED AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A OT AT RISK -- BUT I THINK WE WANT TO ECHO THE SENTIMENTS OF OUR PARTNERS AT C. POUND WHAT'S AT STAKE -- FOR THE STATE IS IS. MASSIVE AND MAKING SURE THAT ALL SIXTEEN POINT TWO OF OUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS THAT ARE PART OF THE THE HARD TO COUNT. POPULATIONS ARE. PROPERLY OUT REACH TO BY TRUSTED MESSENGERS MULTIPLE HEADS MULTIPLE DOOR KNOBS ON THE WE DISPEL SOME OF THOSE MIXED MESSAGES WHEN FOLKS WERE TELLING FOLKS NOT TO OPEN THE DOOR FOR ICE BUT WE'RE THàNH PHùTO OPEN THE DOOR FOR NUMERATOR SO I THINK. THERE'S A REAL VALID CONCERN FOR MAKE STATUS COMMUNITIES I'M FOR LIMITED ENGLISH COMMITTEES AND WE KNOW THAT TRUSTED MESSENGERS NONPROFIT OUT REACH IS THE WAY THAT THAT MANY OF OUR FOLKS GET THEIR EDUCATION AWARENESS AND ENSURE THAT THEY CAN TRUST OUR GOVERNMENT. THANK YOU THANK YOU. BECAUSE THE RESPONSE OF THE CHAIR THAT THE COALITION FOR HUMANE IMMIGRANT RIGHTS CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST IMMIGRANT RIGHTS ORGANIZATION WE'VE TAKEN AFFIRMATIVE STANCE TO ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE. COUNTED IN THE C. R. TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS -- WE JUST LAUNCHED OUR CAMPAIGN ALL GOING ON LOCAL DEALERS OUT TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS COUNTED AND AREAS OF ORANGE COUNTY LOS ANGELES COUNTY SACRAMENTO COUNTY THE CENTRAL VALLEY. ON CLEANING FRESNO AND OTHER ROLE PARTS OF CALIFORNIA I THINK AS YOU MENTIONED SURE THAT -- IT IS GOING TO BE A CHALLENGING YEAR -- BUT NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL LAW POLICIES BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF MAYBE POSSIBLE -- SUPPRESSION ENGAGE IN CIVIC ENGAGEMENT FOR THE CENSUS AS WE SEEN HAPPEN IN -- TWENTY TEN SO FOR THOSE REASONS ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM C. PAN -- WE WOULD REQUEST TO HAVE OPEN. THANK YOU. OBVIOUSLY SINCE QUESTION IS IS IS HARD I FED LEVY TOSSED A WITH MR CHIU AND AND THIS WEEK ABOUT -- THE ISSUE -- WE TALK STAFF ABOUT IT AT LENGTH -- THERE'S CONCERN ABOUT UNDER COUNT AS A REAL POSSIBILITY. A WITH THAT WE'RE TRYING TO AS MUCH AS WE CAN TO ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS ACCOUNT REPRESENTED. IN THE CENSUS SO WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO BALANCE THAT WITH OLYMPIC. SINCE THE STAFF AGAINST HOUSING STAFF SO A LOT OF MOVING PARTS THERE'S A FINITE NUMBER OF DOLLARS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE GOT A LOT OF ISSUES TO DEAL WITH. THE GOVERNOR SOME VERY AMBITIOUS PLANS -- A LOT OF BALLS IN THE AIR SO YOU'LL SEE WHERE IT GOES FROM HERE SO. AFTER MUCH DELIBERATION HOLES ITEM OPEN AND HAVE FOR DISCUSSIONS. SOMEONE LESS ITEM WHICH IS ITEM NUMBER SEVEN SO NO DEVELOPMENT CENTER CLOSURE YEAH. ALL RIGHT HI MY NAME IS JASON KENNEY I AM THE DIRECTOR FOR REAL ESTATE SERVICES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES -- THE CINEMA DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER PROPOSAL IN FRONT OF YOU REPRESENTS YEARS OF WORK TO GET TO THIS POINT ALL PROVIDE A QUICK OVERVIEW OF PROPOSAL. ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE -- THE PROPOSAL SIX FORTY THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS TO MAINTAIN A NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE ACRE CAMPUS IN CINEMA. AND SUCCESSFULLY DISPOSE OF THE PROPERTY IN A WAY THAT BENEFITS THE STATE AND SUPPORTS LOCAL COMMUNITY IN WHICH IS PROPERTY SETS THE CAMPUS. THE OLDEST OF THE DON'T KNOW CENTERS -- FIRST BEGAN IN EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE IT HAS ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY ACRES OF DEVELOP SITE WITH OVER A HUNDRED TWENTY BILLION BUILDINGS AFTER HAVING BEEN DEVASTATED BY THE NUNS FIRE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN LOSING ABOUT TWENTY STRUCTURES -- HISTORICALLY HAD THE MANAGED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES AND IS BEYOND ITS USEFUL LIFE. OTHER POLLS WILL SEEKS FUNDING IN TWO BASIC AREAS -- ONE TO COVER THREE YEARS OF MAINTENANCE COSTS WHICH WILL PRIMARILY BE PROVIDED VIA CONTRACT TO DDS TO CONTINUE THEIR OVERSIGHT OF THE PROPERTY -- DDS HAS RUN THE FACILITY FOR DECADES AND AS MAINTAIN THE PROPERTY CAN SHUT DOWN SINCE TWENTY EIGHTEEN DECEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHEN THE LAST RESIDENT LEFT THE CENTER. THESE CALLS REFLECTIVE REDUCTION IN DDS A STAFFING OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS TO MORE COST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE PROPERTY. IN ADDITION THE PROPERTY MUST BE REZONED IN ORDER TO SUCCESSFULLY DISPOSED THE PROPERTY IN A WAY THAT BENEFITS THE STATE AND THE COMMUNITY -- TO REDUCE THE STATE COSTS AND LIABILITY FOR THE CAMPUS AND TO INCREASE THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY AS WELL AS INSURER I COMMITTEE INTEGRATION PROPOSAL SEEKS FUNDING TO THE COUNTY TO CONDUCT AN EXPEDITED SPECIFIC PLAN AND RESUME THE SITE. OF THE COST FOR THE X. BUT A PROCESS IS THREE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WHICH WILL CUT THE COUNTIES INITIAL TIME BY MORE THAN HALF I WILL SAY THE STATE APPROXIMATE FORTY IGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN AVOIDED MAINTENANCE COSTS. THE PROPOSAL REPRESENTS THE FOR NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE STATE THE COMMUNITY INCLUDING LOCAL OFFICIALS AND MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE UP IN THE AREA INCLUDING SENATOR DODD SENATOR MCGUIRE AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY. ULTIMATELY THIS PROPOSAL MIRRORS THE AUTHORITY GRANTED TO THE STATE AND THE TRADITIONAL SURPLUS PROCESS -- TO DISPOSE OF THE PROPERTY HOWEVER THE MAIN DIFFERENCE IS THE EXPEDITED US SPECIFIC PLAN PROCESS WHICH WILL SAVE THE STATE MONEY AND SAFEGUARD THE FUTURE USE THE PROPERTY IN COMMUNITY INTERESTS. OF THE THE PROPOSAL ALSO HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WHICH PASSED A RESOLUTION APRIL FIFTH SUPPORTING THE CONCEPT AND AGREEING TO TO BEGIN WORK ON THE EXPANDED PLAN -- AND REZONING IN THIS CURRENT YEAR. THANK YOU FINANCE. LA UP. HIKERS YOU AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- I APOLOGIZE WE DIDN'T GET OUR RECOMMENDATIONS OUT VERY FAR IN ADVANCE ON THIS -- ONE AS I KIND OF LIKE BREAKING PROPOSAL FROM THE ADMINISTRATION WE ACTUALLY HAVE. FIVE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS ON THIS PROPOSAL THE FIRST IS TO LIMIT THE FUNDING TO YOU JUST NINETEEN TWENTY SO AS WAS MENTIONED BY THE DEPARTMENT THEY'RE PROPOSING -- PROVIDING THREE YEARS OF FUNDING -- WE SUGGEST WHEN YOU'RE FINDING BECAUSE WE THINK THERE'S SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY REGARDING -- THE FUNDING LEVELS THAT WILL BE REQUIRED FOR THIS WARM SHUT DOWN PERIOD AND MAINTENANCE THE PROPERTY PARTICULARLY IN THE OUT YEARS ADDITIONALLY A PROVIDING JUST WHEN YOU'RE FINDING WILL PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THE ADMINISTRATION COME BACK NEXT YEAR REPORT ON WHERE IT IS HOW THE PROCESS. IS WORKING -- AND WHAT FUNDING THEY NEED. SO I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE'RE ALSO PROPOSING -- AS WAS MENTIONED -- THERE'S A FUNDING PROVIDED TO THAT COUNTY OF SO NO MY TO DO A LOCAL PLANNING PROCESS THIS IS PERHAPS PRETTY UNUSUAL -- WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT -- THIS CINEMA COUNTY BE REQUIRED TO SEEK REIMBURSEMENT FOR THIS FUNDING RATHER THAN HAVING THE FUNDING PROVIDED UP FRONT -- PART OF THIS IS BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A UNIQUE THING FOR US TO BE PAYING FOR THESE KINDS OF COST WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH HOW MUCH THEY SHOULD BE. AND THREE POINT FIVE MILLION IS IS A SIGNIFICANT OUT OF FUNDING. THE THIRD RECOMMENDATION IS TO MODIFY THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO REFLECT THE LEGISLATURE'S GOALS SO WHAT WILL AS WAS REFERENCE THERE'S TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT ACCOMPANIES THIS PROPOSAL. IT ESTABLISHES A PROCESS FOR DISPOSING OF THIS PROPERTY THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM THE TRADITIONAL SURPLUS PROPERTY PROCESS IN SOME WAYS IT'S SIMILAR -- BUT ACTUALLY PROVIDES EVEN BROADER AUTHORITY TO THE DEAD DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT A PROVIDE SOME VERY BROAD GOALS -- BUT NOT MUCH IN TERMS OF SPECIFICITY -- AND IT THE TRADITIONAL PROCESS HAVE KIND OF A LOADING ORDER OF THINGS THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AND THAT'S ABSENT HERE -- SO WE THINK THAT IF THE LEGISLATURE HAS SPECIFIC GOALS THINGS LIKE -- ITS GOALS FOR ACHIEVING -- CERTAIN OUTCOMES FOR THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED COMMUNITY OR FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT THESE COULD BE MADE MORE CLEAR. I WE ALSO SUGGEST -- FOURTH THAT THE TRAILER BILL BE AMENDED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. THIS COULD BE DONE FOR EXAMPLE BY REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT TO COME BACK WITH A NOTIFICATION PRIOR TO THE SALE OR A MONTH FROM THE PROPERTY. AND THEN THE FIFTH RECOMMENDATION IS JUST TO CONSIDER WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE'S COMFORTABLE WITH -- THE POTENTIAL PRESIDENT THAT THIS COULD SAT I SO THIS PROPERTY IS QUITE UNIQUE WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS THE DEPARTMENT IS COMFORTABLE WITH TAKING THIS APPROACH -- BUT THIS IS AN UNUSUAL APPROACH JUST THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S INVOLVED IS UNUSUAL PLAYING PAYING FOR THESE LOCAL PLANNING COST IS UNUSUAL AND ALSO -- THE PROCESS IT'S ENVISIONED IN THAT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE I SAID CERTAINLY OTHER COMMUNITIES COULD COULD MAKE SIMILAR ASKS IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU. WITH THE PROPER TRANSITION THE D. G. S. WAS THE MOST LIKELY FINAL USABLE AND IT WILL DEPEND ALTERNATELY ON WHAT THE FINAL REZONING IS -- WE DO AND IT IS A PAID COMMERCIAL USE -- AS WELL AS HOUSING BOTH -- MARKET AND AFFORDABLE -- THERE WILL BE OTHER LOCALIZED PACIFIC USES THERE IS A CEMETERY ON CAMPUS AND SO THAT WERE MAIN AS SUCH -- THEY'RE LIKELY BE MUSEUM -- THEY'VE BEEN A NUMBER OF OTHER EXPRESSED COMMUNITY -- PROPOSALS AS WELL MOST OF THE CAMPUS IS CURRENTLY OPEN SPACE AND THAT WILL REMAIN -- IF THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS IS IS PUT FORWARD -- THIS ABOUT NINE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE ACRES IN THE CAMPUS IN TOTAL AND APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY PLUS OR MINUS ARE OPEN SPACE SO REMAIN. FORCE THAT AREA. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE. GROWING UP IN A PUBLIC COMMENT. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CAROLING ABOUT THIS AND ON THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HERE WITH ART WHEN THE STRONGER SUPPORT FOR THIS PROPOSAL THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS.

TO ADDRESS VARIOUS AUDIT FINDINGS -- AS WELL AS OTHER CRITICAL AND MET WORKLOAD NEEDS -- AT A RELATED TO BOTH FISTS CAL AND CROSS IMPLEMENTATION -- WE CONDUCTED AN INTERNAL ANALYSIS INDICATING THAT WE NEEDED TEN ADDITIONAL POSITIONS IN OUR ACCOUNTING AREA. OF THE TEN POSITIONS FIVE WERE REDIRECTED FROM OTHER AREAS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT AND THE IDENTIFIED BUT WE ARE RESTRICTED FROM REDIRECTING THOSE BECAUSE THEY ARE CATEGORIZED AS PROVISION. ONE OR REVENUE PRODUCING -- POSITIONS -- AS DAVE DESIGNATED IN PROVISION ONE AS A RESULTS WE REQUEST FINANCE APPROVAL -- TO AND LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL TO RE DIRECT. OF FIVE VACANT PROVISION ONE POSITIONS IN HOUSE AND PROVIDE A NINETY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR AUGMENTATION IN THE BUDGET AND I'M GOING TO FUND THE SALARY DIFFERENCE FOR THOSE POSITIONS FINANCE [inaudible] LL. SEC CHRISTINE LA ERA AS NOTED IN THE STAFF COMMON IN THE AGENDA THE NECESSITY OF THIS REQUEST COMES FROM A PROVISION ONE OF THE BUDGET ACT WHICH APPLIES -- TO THE THREE A TAXIDERMIST MINISTRATION AGENCIES AND THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF SERVE A TRADE OFF THAT IT'S ARISES FROM INCLUDING THIS PROVISION IN THE BUDGET ACT IT. PROVIDES SOME BUDGET CONTROLLING OVERSIGHT BUT AT THE SAME TIME REDUCES DEPARTMENTS FLEXIBILITY AND EFFICIENCY -- GIVEN THE STRAIGHT OFF WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE RECONSIDER WHETHER THIS LONG STANDING PROVISION IS WARRANTED.

AND WE'VE BEEN DOING OUR LEVEL BEST TO READ OR RE DIRECT RESOURCES FROM WITHIN RATHER THAN COME -- TO THE LEGISLATURE AND FINANCE WITH LARGE ASKS -- AND WE'RE ABLE TO DO THAT IN MANY ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT FUNCTIONS -- BUT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR DEPARTMENT -- HAVE -- COLLECTIONS AN AUDITING STAFF THAT ARE DESIGNATED PROVISION -- ONE MORE THAN HALF OF THE ENTERPRISE AND SO IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO MOVE POSITIONS AROUND BECAUSE BECAUSE OF THAT DESIGNATION -- ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING WITH LA -- AND FINANCES POSSIBLY -- JUST CHANGING THE DEFINITION OF WHAT PROVISION ONE IS IF IF THERE ISN'T A DESIRE TO DO AWAY WITH IT COMPLETELY. PERHAPS JUST REDEFINE IT TO GIVE US SOME FLEXIBILITY TO MOVE POSITIONS AROUND AND WE WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO REPORT. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS OR WHATEVER -- APPROPRIATE TIME FRAME TO THE LEGISLATURE SO YOU HAVE A WINDOW INTO -- THE CHANGES THAT WERE MAKING. AND I JUST SAID -- A LOT OF THE EXTERNAL REVIEWS FOCUSED ON SOME WEAKNESSES IN ACCOUNTING AND SO THAT'S WHERE OUR PAIN IS IS MOST SEVERE WHICH IS WHY WE'RE ASKING FOR ACCOUNTING SPECIFICALLY HERE. WE SO WEAKNESSES IN THE ACCOUNTING. YES SO -- AS AS KATIE MENTIONED -- TO OUR DEPARTMENT WAS FOUNDED JUST TWO YEARS AGO AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN IN PART AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS EXTERNAL REVIEWS ON THE CONTROLLER -- SAY DID YOU ASK TRUCK -- AND SO A LOT OF THOSE REVIEWS FOCUSED ON WEAKNESSES IN ACCOUNTING SO FOR IS A ARNOLD CONTROL MA'AM FOR FOR EXAMPLE -- THERE IS A ONE TIME FEE OVER FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR -- BASICALLY REALLOCATION OUR SALES TAX FUND -- AND THERE ARE SOME OTHER GAPS THAT WERE THAT WERE WORKING TO FILL A MEDICINE YOUR LEVEL WE'VE RESTRUCTURED I'M OUR DIVISION AND SEE A ROLES -- TO FOCUS MORE ON ACCOUNTING AND ON OPERATIONS AND THE SASS FOCUSES MORE ON THE STAFF LEVEL -- PERSONNEL TO REALLY IMPLEMENT SOME OF THESE CONTROLS.

ALRIGHT SO -- THE ETEXT PAIRED -- TRANSPARENT. TRANSPARENCY AND FAIRNESS ACT OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ESTABLISH THE CD TFA TO PERFORM MANDATED WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONTROL -- AND REGULATE AND TAX ADULT USE OF MARIJUANA ACT PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR AND THE BUSINESS ROLE AN ADULT USE CANNABIS REGULATION AND SAFETY ACT OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN CD TFA HASN'T ENFORCEMENT ROLE IN THE CANNABIS TAX PROGRAM -- BUT HAS BEEN UNABLE TO COMMENCE ENFORCEMENT OF LICENSING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS WITH CURRENT RESOURCES. CD TFA REQUEST TWO POINT NINE MILLION AND THIRTEEN POINT NINE POSITIONS IN FISCAL YEAR. NINETEEN TWENTY WITH THE APPROVAL THE REQUESTED ESOURCES THE CD TFA COULD BEGIN ADDRESSING NON COMPLIANCE ISSUES RESULTING IN ANTICIPATED ADDITIONAL REVENUE FOR THE STATE. AND I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT UP TO THIS POINT -- WE'VE ARE WE HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY ENGAGING ON EDUCATION AND OUTREACH OF OUR TAXPAYERS -- AND THIS VCP IS SPECIFICALLY FOR ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES L. L.. WE HAVE NO CONCERNS. FINANCE. PROVIDING ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES WILL ACHIEVE THE BROADER GOAL OF HELPING FORMALIZE THE INDUSTRY. ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE COMMITTEE. OPEN UP PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM -- CAN SEE TSA QUICK QUESTION FOR MR LACKEY. YEAH ON THIS PARTICULAR MEASURE IS ANY THIS FUNDING OR ANY THESE POSITIONS FOCUSED ON GOING AFTER A LIST OF MARKET PLAYERS OR IS THIS JUST ALL THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO COMPLY AND LICENSING. NO YET YOUR YES THERE ARE -- THAT THESE RESOURCES ARE FOR ENFORCEMENT SO -- AS I INDICATED THAT -- OUR EFFORTS TO DATE HAVE BEEN ON EDUCATION AND OUTREACH -- AND WE'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE FOLKS THAT ARE FILING YOUR TAXES THAT WE'RE GOING AFTER WITH THIS P. C. P. WE WILL BE TARGETING THOSE THEY'RE NOT COMPLIANT -- GOING AFTER -- DISTRIBUTORS -- RETAIL SALES SHOPS THERE'S AND A WHOLE NUMBER OF UNDERGROUND AND CONNIE WITH THOSE I I'M JUST TRYING TO SAY THAT. IT SEEMS LIKE MOST OF OUR ENFORCEMENT HAS BEEN ON THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO COMPLY. AND I FIND THAT TO BE EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING AND ALSO IMMORAL. THAT WE SHOULD BE GOING AFTER THESE NON COMPLIANT FOLKS WHO ARE DOMINATING THE MARKET RIGHT NOW WE WOULD AGREE AND THAT THAT'S WHAT THESE RESOURCES ARE DEDICATED THANK YOU THANK YOU. BUT BUT THESE RESOURCES THESE ARE NOT PEACE OFFICER POSITIONS AT THEIR AT THERE'S A NUMBER OF THEM THAT ARE LIMITED PEACE OFFICER WE DON'T HAVE FULL PEACE OFFICER STATUS IN OUR DEPARTMENT. WE WILL HAVE TO CANNABIS GROW IN CALIFORNIA LEASE THE STATE. CORRECT CORRECT AND I I MEAN THAT THAT REALLY COMES BACK. TO THE PRIORITIES WITH EDUCATION AND OUTREACH ABSOLUTELY AND CAN I ALSO ADD THAT -- I YOUR REFERENCE OUT OF STATE -- I WANT TO EMPHASIZE TWO THAT WE WORK IN COLLABORATION WITH A NUMBER OF IT ENTITIES WE WORK WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE C. H. P. -- SO WE ARE NOT OPERATING IN A VACUUM WERE VERY COLLABORATIVE WITH KEY PARTNERS IN -- ADDRESSING CANNABIS IS NOT SO HOW'S THAT BEEN SO FAR A GOOD EXAMPLE IN SACRAMENTO SACRAMENTO IS GROUND ZERO FOR LISTA GROWS IN RESIDENTIAL HOUSES. IN THE NATION M. ARE YOU AWARE THAT. I AM NOW. SO WHAT WHAT WHAT. WHAT HAPPENS WITH THAT WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT SEARCH SEARCH WARRANTS TYPICALLY MINISTRY SEARCH WARRANTS THEY GO AND BECAUSE THEY ARE COLLECTED TO THE? IF THE POWER GRID ILLEGALLY THEY SHUT THAT DOWN LEAVE THE MARIJUANA IN THERE YES I WOULD HOPE THAT -- THE DEPARTMENT WORKS WITH THAT TO TRY SECURE LEGISLATION WE'RE LAW FOR SHIPPING GOING TO DESTROY THE MIDDLE EAST. BECAUSE THE BOTTOM LINE IF LAW ENFORCEMENT LEAVES THAT MARIJUANA IN THOSE HOUSES IT STILL MAKES IT OUT TO THE BLACK MARKET. SO I BELIEVE THE ENFORCEMENT LEGAL MARKET IS IMPORTANT CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE WITH THE LEGAL MARKET. BEFORE TAKE ACTION TO INCREASE THE ENFORCEMENT LEGAL MARKET. NEED HELP DISCUSSION ON THE FORCE MEN AND DIRECTED AT THE ILLEGAL MARKET. LEGAL MARKET CONTINUES TO THRIVE AND GROW WHICH UNDER BECAUSE LEGAL PARTICIPANTS WHO ARE PLAYING BY THE RULES AND THREATENED TO PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS SO I HEARD YOU SAY ABOUT THAT. THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO FOLKS ARE STILL THE BLACK MARKET BUT THERE AND GOT ONE FROM THE BLACK MARKET ONE FOR THE LEGAL MARKET. ON THAT ISSUE SO IT'S A REAL IT'S IT'S A PROBLEM ANDYOU'RE TACKLING A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF IT BUT BY FAR THE VAST MAJORITY IS ILLEGAL MARKETING. NELSON THESE FOLKS A PLAN IN BOTH IN BOTH ROLES. I THINK EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS THAT ALICIA BLIND [inaudible] YES. YOU WANT TO COMMENT YES -- MICHAEL READY TO SEE THE TFA INVESTIGATIONS I JUST WANTED. TO KIND OF TOUCH ON THAT WE'RE DOING A LOT OF THE PARTNERSHIP FOR THE LOCAL JURISDICTION IS MISTAKEN IS POINTED OUT. AS WELL AS BUREAU CAMPUS CONTROL -- CANNABIS ENFORCEMENT UNIT. WHICH IS TIED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS SO THAT SEEMS THE COLLABORATION SEEMS TO BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR EFFORTS TOWARDS TRYING TO GET PEOPLE IN COMPLIANCE FOR DO YOU HAVE ANY NUMBERS OR STATISTICS. ABOUT WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE DONE THE WATSON. YEAH I'D BE NICE OKAY -- SO WE'VE DONE THIS IS LOCALIZED IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA IS THIS IS THIS IS THIS YOUR AGENCY DOING IT TO YOUR AGENCY. EXISTING LOCAL LOCALS WHO WERE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND WE'RE JUST GOING ALONG WITH THEM CORRECT THEM ON SEARCH WARRANTS SAY IN THE IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA BUT THE FOR THE FOR SHIFTING OUT WITH THEM OR TYPICALLY NON SWORN. WERE LIMITED PEACE OFFICER SO WE HAVE SEARCH WARRANT AUTHORITY BUT ONE BUT WHEN YOU SAY LIMITED PEACE OFFICERS THOSE ARE UNARMED CORRECT THAT'S OR NOT. NO NO WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT PLEASE OFTEN. THEY'RE NOT. SALUTE TERM LIMIT PIECE AUTHORS IS A VERY IS MISLEADING SO THEY'RE NOT COPS NO NO THEY'RE NOT OKAY. THIS MAKES THANK YOU OKAY. SO WE'VE GOT ABOUT TWO THIS IS FOR A PILOT IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA -- DONE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY VISITS -- WE'VE THAT PARTICIPATED IN ABOUT SEVENTY SEARCH WARRANTS WITH THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE'VE HAD ABOUT -- FORTY SIX CRIMINAL CITATIONS ISSUED AND WE HAVE ABOUT -- FIVE CRIMINAL CASES THAT ARE PENDING THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH THE LOCAL PROSECUTOR HOW MANY PLACES HAVE BEEN CLOSED AS A RESULT OF THAT -- ABOUT SEVENTY NO EIGHTY ONE COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN CLOSED. OUT OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND BUT WHEN YOU SAY COMPLAINTS CLOSE AND SALAS MY LAST QUESTION WE GOT HERE. WE SAY COMPLAINTS CLOSE OR IS THE OPERATION CLOSE THAT'S RIGHT THE OPERATION IS CLOSE. SO THE PLACES BEEN SHUT DOWN CLOSED [inaudible] OKAY. THE WHOLE THIS ITEM OPEN. OBVIOUSLY THERE'S THERE'S OBVIOUSLY FOR SOME COUPLE NUMBERS TO THE HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT. THE DIRECTION WE'RE HEADED IN. SOMEWHAT OUR NEXT ITEM I'M NUMBER -- TWELVE TAX IF YOU PROGRAM'S GIRLS OFFICE OF TAX APPEALS WORKLOAD. GREAT -- IN JANUARY THE OFFICE OF IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE OFFICES TAX PILLS IMPLEMENTED THE NEW ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING PROCESS OF TAX APPEALS. WHICH INCREASE THE CDC FAA'S WORKLOAD FROM APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FORTY EIGHTY HOURS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY HOURS FOR EACH TAX DEAL. INVOLVING LEGAL ISSUES AND FROM THREE HOURS TO TWENTY HOURS FOR EACH TAX BILL INVOLVING AUDIT ISSUES. THE CD TFA REQUEST FOLLOWING RESOURCES ONE MILLION FOR SIX PERMANENT POSITIONS IN FISCAL YEAR. NINETEEN TWENTY AN EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND FOR FISCAL YEAR ON GOING. HELLO. WE HAVE NO CONCERNS FINANCE. THE QUESTION COMMITTEE. WHICH IS AREA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I MAKE. TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK A FEW QUESTIONS AND I'M I'M HAPPY TO ROLL IT ALL INTO ONE IF YOU CAN REMEMBER THE QUESTIONS ALSO -- WANTED TO JUST GET A SENSE OF HOW YOUR WORK HAS BEEN -- WITH THE THE APPEALS PROCESS HAS BEEN GOING FORWARD WITH UNDER OTA GIVEN THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION THAT IT WAS AND SO IF YOU CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT JUST THE DIFFERENCES THE RIVER. AND THEN ALSO THE ROLLOUT PROCESS OF HOW IT'S BEEN IT'S RELATIVELY NEW YEAR AND A HALF SO -- IF YOU CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. WHAT CHALLENGES THERE BEEN AND -- AND AND AND OR HOW MAY BE POTENTIALLY IT'S ALSO BECOME EASIER -- TO MOVE FORWARD -- AND ALSO IF YOU CAN TOUCH UPON A LITTLE BIT ON THE INTERACTION BETWEEN -- OF THE D. O. T. A. AND AND TAXPAYERS IN THIS PROCESS -- I'M HAPPY TO CONTINUE WITH THE OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU AND I FAST I'M OUR CHIEF COUNSEL INTERIM CHIEF COUNSEL BOB TUCKER HE IS THE RESIDENT EXPERT ON THIS TOPIC SO HE'S GOING TO HELP AT RESPOND TO QUESTIONS. YES -- BOB TUCKER CITY CAFE -- IT'S PROBABLY THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCES IT COMES DOWN TO THE TRANSPARENCY. RIGHT NOW WITH O'DONNELL EVERYTHING TAKES PLACE IN A FORUM WHERE -- WE HAVE CONFERENCES WE HAVE PRE HEARING CONFERENCES THERE IS BRIEFING THAT GOES BACK AND FORTH ALTHOUGH. THIS TOOK PLACE ON A LIMITED BASIS BEFORE MUCH OF WHAT OCCURRED OCCURRED ACTUALLY IN THE MEMBERS OFFICES OUTSIDE OF ANY OUTSIDE OF OUR REVIEW AND IT WAS DONE AND AN EX PARTE FASHION. MEANING THAT WE WEREN'T SIMPLY A PART OF IT WHATSOEVER. SO -- IF THERE ARE ADDITIONAL STEPS THERE ARE -- ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS THAT WE MEET IN ORDER SO -- THAT CAN -- PREPARE AND PROVIDE A WRITTEN RESPONSE AND PROVIDE A BRIEF. THAT IS AVAILABLE ON THE THERE -- WEB PAGES. BUT WE SEE THAT AS AN ADVANTAGE IT GIVES -- SUNLIGHT TO WHAT THEY'RE DOING. THE ROLL OUT IT'S IT'S TAKEN SUMMIT ADAPT THE IN -- THEY'RE IMPLEMENTING A NEW PROCESS AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SIMPLY DIDN'T EXIST BEFORE. SO WE HAVE. SPENT SIGNIFICANT TIME WORKING WITH A WITH A DEVELOPING PROCESSES. SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE -- THE INFORMATION THAT'S NECESSARY. SO THAT WE CAN HAVE IT AS I SAID A TRANSPARENT PROCESS WITH THE TAXPAYERS THEY IMPLEMENTED THE REGULATIONS WHICH CAME ON BOARD AT THE END OF LAST YEAR. AND IT'S A IT. IN SOME REGARDS IT'S U. S. WHAT'S EASIER IT'S EASIER BECAUSE IT IS TRANSPARENT AND IT'S EASIER BECAUSE IT IS OUT IN THE SUNLIGHT -- IT'S MORE WORK FOR US BUT IT'S WORK THAT'S WE'RE HAPPY TO DO AND I THINK IT'S WORK THAT'S NECESSARY SO THAT WE HAVE THIS TRANSPARENT PROCESS. AS TO THE INTERACTION BETWEEN ODIN THAT TAX PAYERS. WE'RE NOT PRIVY TO MUCH OF THAT BUT I KNOW THEY'VE HAD SIGNIFICANT -- MEETINGS -- INTERESTED PARTIES MEETINGS FOR THE COURTS OF THE REGULATIONS. THEY HAVE -- PLACE THEIR INFORMATION OUT ON THE WEB PAGE SO IT'S AVAILABLE FOR TAXPAYERS TO CONTACT THEM. AND IT IT APPEARS THAT THEY'RE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO MAKE THEMSELVES AVAILABLE. CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE CHANGE IN NUMBERS. OF TAXPAYER SERVED AND THE PROCESS -- WE HAVE IT IT'S WE HAVE NOT HAD AS MANY HEARINGS IN THE FIRST YEAR. THERE WAS A RAMP UP PERIOD AND IF BEGINNING AROUND DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR IT'S STARTING TO INCREASE. SO THAT THEY WERE FOCUSING ON IF -- INCOME TAX IF THE FOR PERHAPS YES BUT AS FAR AS FOR OUR CASES WITH CD TFA WE'RE STARTING TO SEE A ROLL OUT AND AS THEY USE -- ARE IMPLEMENTING THEIR PROCESSES WE'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE HEARINGS. SO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT -- TRANSPARENCY AND SOME LIKE -- WHAT'S BEEN A DIFFERENCE IN THE PUBLISHED OPINIONS. ONE BECAUSE THERE ARE THEIR WORK PUBLISHED OPINIONS BEFORE SO THAT'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE -- IT'S A CHANCE FOR PEOPLE TO SEE AND UNDERSTAND THE REASONING THE LOGIC THAT GOES INTO THE DECISION THAT WAS MADE. AS OPPOSED TO BEFORE UNDER THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION THERE WAS SIMPLY A DECISION WITH NO EXPLANATION BECAUSE OF MY EX PARTE COMMUNICATION WHAT. THIS PERHAPS BECAUSE THAT BUT ALSO BECAUSE THE BOARD DID NOT TYPICALLY PUBLISHER WRITTEN DECISION SO IT WAS SIMPLY DONE WITH AN IRON ARE NAY THERE AT THE BOARD AND SO YOU WOULDN'T. YOU WOULDN'T HAVE NECESSARILY KNOW WHY OR WHAT THEIR LOGIC WAS AND NOW HERE EVERYTHING CAN BE EXAMINED -- IF IF WE WERE. TO HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THE DECISION OR IF THE TAXPAYER WERE TO HAVE AN ISSUE WITH A DECISION. THEY SEE THE LOGIC LAID OUT IN FRONT OF THEM AND THEY CAN FILE A PETITION FOR REHEARING. SO IT I AS I SAID I THINK IT MAKES A PROCESS THAT IS. OFF ONCE AGAIN -- MORE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC MORE TRANSPARENT. WHICH I BELIEVE WAS THE STATED GOAL ALL PARK FIGURE HOW MANY OPINIONS YOU THINK YOU'VE -- AND THE LAST THE HERE YEAR INFORMANTS WE ALL. WE HAVE BRIEFED THE NUMBER OF CASES -- PROBABLY A COUPLE HUNDRED WE'VE HAD -- THE CASES BEGAN PRIMARILY IN DECEMBER AND WE'VE HAD PROBABLY THIRTY TO FORTY CASES I THINK BY NOW. THAT. AND A MISTER ZICK NAZARIAN IF I COULD ADD -- AS I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY WHEN YOU ASK A QUESTION ABOUT REDIRECTING RESOURCES -- THIS IS ANOTHER AREA WHERE THE WORKLOAD IS THERE NOW AND SO WE'VE REDIRECTED POSITIONS FROM WITHIN THREE AM. NON PROVISION ONE POSITIONS FROM OTHER US SUPPORT AREAS AND WE'D LIKE TO MOVE TO FROM THE INVESTIGATIONS DIVISION -- THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS PROVISION ONE SO AGAIN WE'RE WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR POSITIONS WERE JUST ASKING FOR THE AUTHORITY TO USE OUR POSITIONS AND THEN A FUNDING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM I AM IN COMPLETE SUPPORT OF WHAT THE A SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIR JUST MENTIONED. AWHILE AGO I I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR YOU TO NOT BE SHACKLED WITH THE RESTRICTIONS THAT WERE PLACED BECAUSE OF POTENTIALLY -- SOME DISCRETION THAT VERSION WAS NOT USED IN PREVIOUS. A CIRCUMSTANCES SO I I'D BE VERY MUCH SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT HE SAID -- HOW SO HOW MANY APPEALS THE EXPECTED ON AN ONGOING BASIS? TO COME UP. AGAIN BALLPARK RIGHT HE HAD OVER TO HOLD YOU TO HIT HIM THING AS YOU'RE TRYING TO GUESSTIMATE IT WILL HISTORICALLY -- WE HAVE APPEAL THAT WE REGARD AS LEGAL APPEALS IN APPEALS THAT WE REGARD AS AUDIT APPEALS -- TYPICALLY WE'VE HAD ABOUT A HUNDRED LEGAL APPEALS IN A YEAR AND WEEK WE'RE ESTIMATING BETWEEN HUNDRED HUNDRED FIFTIETH THINK AND THAT WOULD BE THE WORKLOAD FOR THE STAFF. AND IN THE LAST NINE MONTHS -- I THINK WE'RE PRETTY CLOSE. IF IF IF THE IF MY NOTES SERVE ME CORRECTLY I THINK A UP PREVIOUSLY IN THE LAST TEN YEARS THERE'S ONLY BEEN TWO PUBLISHED. OPINIONS YEAH UP PRIOR TO CD TFA SO -- I AM. VERY PLEASED TO HEAR. OF WHERE THE WHERE THE WITH THE CHANGE FROM A YEAR AND A HALF AGO IT'S TAKEN. YOUR ADMINISTRATION AND HOW IT'S IMPROVING UPON THE PROCESS IF WE KEEP ON CHANGING THE GOAL POST THERE BECAUSE THERE'S GOING TO BE NO CONFIDENCE. IN THE PROCESS SO THE SANCTITY OF ALL OF THIS IS DEPENDENT ON HOW WELL THE PROCESS WORKS. TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK AND THANKS FOR ANSWERING SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU. FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. THE RECOMMENDATION IS PROPOSED BUDGET IS OUR MOTION. ROLL CALL PLEASE [inaudible] COOPER HI. TO LACKEY. NAZARIAN. WICKS. ONE IS NEVER THIRTEEN SETTLEMENT TAXPAYERS SERVICES BUREAU -- OKAY -- THE CITY TFA ADMINISTERS MORE THAN THIRTY TAX AND FEE PROGRAMS THAT GENERATE REVENUE ESSENTIAL TO THE STATE CALIFORNIA. THE SETTLEMENTS AND TAXPAYERS SERVICES BUREAU ADMINISTERS THE CD TFA SETTLEMENT PROGRAM. BYEFFICIENTLY NEGOTIATING AND RESOLVING DISPUTED TAX LIABILITIES IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS PROCESS. SOME APRIL REQUEST PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT OF SIX POSITIONS SYSTEM. IT'S THE SAME NUMBER I'M SORRY YEAH THIS IS -- AT SIX LIMITED TERM WE HAVE SIX LIMITED TERM POSITION SET TO EXPIRE -- THAT'S RIGHT IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR -- AND ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY ON GOING TO ADDRESS A HUNDRED AND 81% INCREASE. IN TAXPAYER DEMAND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SETTLEMENTS WITH THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM FROM A TWENTY TEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE CITY TFA EXPECTS THESE SIX POSITIONS TOOK SALARY COLLECTION OF NEARLY FORTY THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION. AND ADDITIONAL REVENUE ANNUALLY SO WE DO HAVE -- THE STAFF TO CURRENTLY -- BUT THEY'RE LIMITED TERM POSITIONS THAT ARE SET TO EXPIRE IN JUNE AND WE WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND THOSE. CREATE THEM PERMANENTLY. LL. I WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSED RESOURCES THE SOME OF THE WORKLOAD PROJECTIONS IN THE PROPOSAL SEEM TO SUGGEST THAT THE PROPOSED RESOURCES WOULD NOT BE ADEQUATE AND THAT -- BACKLOG COULD CONTINUE IN THE PROGRAM WE VIEW THOSE WORKLOAD PROJECTIONS AS LIKELY TO HIGH AND AND THINK THAT THE WORK LOAD LIKELY MATCHES -- PRETTY WELL WITH THE PROPOSED RESOURCES. FINANCE. MAKING THESE PERMANENT MATCHES THE WORKLOAD. THE QUESTION ON THE COMMITTEE. THIS IS ERIN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- IN. ALONG THE LINES OF PROCESS I WANTED TO ASK IF THE A YOU CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SETTLEMENT PROCESS. IN THIS IN THIS ARENA -- I GUESS THE BEST EXPLANATION TO BE THAT THE SETTLEMENT -- BUREAU IS AVAILABLE FOR TAXPAYERS WHEN THEY'RE IN THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS PROCESS. AND AT ANY TIME IF THEY DECIDE THAT THEY WISH -- TO MORE LET'S PUT THAT ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS -- PROCESS ON HOLD THERE WERE ABLE TO COME TO OUR SETTLEMENT BUREAU. AND AT THAT TIME. THE SETTLEMENT BUREAU IS ABLE TO WORK WITH THEM -- TO LOOK AT THE RISK OF LITIGATION AND TO WORK ON A SETTLEMENT PROPOSAL. AND WHICH THEY DEVELOP A NUMBER THAT IN ESSENCE ALLOWS. THEM TO AS WITH STATE BEFORE ACCELERATE THE REVENUE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT. IT SHORT CUTS THAT ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS PROCESS PROVIDE CERTAINTY AND THEN -- PUTS AN END OF THAT PROCESS TO IT IT'S A MEANS WHICH IT CAN. REDUCE THE COSTS. RATHER THAN GOING THROUGH AN EXTENSIVE ADMINISTAFF'S BEER. FOR THE TAXPAYER IN FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR BOTH BECAUSE I THINK. I'VE SPENT TWENTY YEARS WORKING ON ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS AND I THINK ONE THING THAT PEOPLE FORGET OR THEY SOMETIMES DON'T FOCUS ON THEIR COSTS FOR TAXPAYERS AN ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL. IT'S NOT JUST THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO IF PEOPLE UTILIZE THE SETTLEMENT BUREAU THEY CAN ALLOW THEM. TO AT THEIR OWN WILL THEY CAN REDUCE THEIR COSTS AS WELL. SO HOW'S THAT HOW HOW -- HOW REGULAR HAS THE ENGAGEMENT AND I WANT TO PUT WORDS IN SO? HAS THERE BEEN A REGULAR ENGAGEMENT WITH TAXPAYERS HAS THERE BEEN AN INCREASE IN REGULAR ENGAGEMENT -- BY ARE YOU BY ENGAGEMENT YOU MEAN LIKE PERSONAL INTERACTION OR DO YOU MEAN SIMPLY SETTLEMENT -- THE NEEDLE IN SETTLEMENT THROUGH THE PROCESS THAT YOU HAVE FAILED -- HOUSE THEY CHANGED. IT'S WELL IT THE ADVANTAGE THAT WE HAVE IS WITH AN OFFICE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AT AT LAW IT ALLOWS FOR PERSONAL INTERACTION AND IT ALLOWS -- FOR INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A PROFESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVE SOMETIMES IT'S AN INDIVIDUAL OF HIS OR HER OWN ACCORD COMING IN. AND WANTED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT AND SO IT'S NOT. I THINK ONE OF THE UNIQUE THINGS WE HAVE IT'S IT'S NOT A OVERLY FORMAL PROCESS IT ALLOWS AN INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS PERSON AND MANY OF THESE BUSINESS PEOPLE ARE SMALL. FOR LIKE A BETTER DESCRIPTION MOM AND POP BUSINESSES OFTEN HAVE GONE OUT OF BUSINESS AND INFO HERE ANYWHERE TO COLLECT SO IT GIVES THEM AND AN OPPORTUNITY -- TO HAVE PERSONAL INTERACTION AND TO DO IT IN A MUCH QUICKER FASHION BECAUSE IF YOU'RE MEETING IN PERSON A ITS EASIER THAN -- DOING SO BY MAIL OR EVEN BY PHONE BECAUSE YOU'RE ABLE TO EXT IF YOU HAVE THE RECORDS THERE. YOU CAN ADDRESS IT INSTANTLY AS OPPOSED -- TO TAKING DAYS OR WEEKS SO IT'S LESSEN THE ANXIETY AND THE BURDEN ON THE TAXPAYER. I WILDLY HOLDS US. I WOULD HOPE SO MORE DIRECTLY ACCESSIBLE. MISTER CHAIR IF YOU CAN ALLOW ME FOR A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS ABSOLUTELY -- SO. IF IF WITHOUT THESE NEW POSITIONS WHAT SORT OF REPERCUSSIONS. WOULD THERE BE. IT IT IT WILL IT WILL I AM THE SEMINAL INCREASE OUR WORKLOAD IN THAT WE WOULD LOSE THE SIX POSITIONS AND IT COULD ULTIMATELY LEAD TO A BACKLOG WHICH WOULD MEAN -- SETTLEMENTS NOT BEING HANDLED THIS TIMELY -- TAXPAYERS NOT GETTING THEIR RESOLUTION IS TIMELY. SO IN DOING SO IT AFFORDS INCREASED REVENUE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. INCREASED CERTAINTY TO TAXPAYERS AND I'M ASSUMING IT MAKES. ONCE THEY COMPLETE THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE MATTER I'M SURE THAT MAKES IT EASIER FOR THEM AS WELL. IT JUST REDUCES THEIR ANXIETY BUT I THINK I'D BE BELIEVE BRING THE POINT IF I A ASKED YOU TO MAKE A COMPARISON AND COMPARE CONTRAST. BETWEEN THE PROCESS YOU HAVE NOW FOR SETTLEMENT VERSUS THE OF THE THE PROCESS. DURING THE B. O. E.. ADMINISTRATION OF THIS AREA BUT IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVEN'T SAID THAT YOU'D LIKE. TO AYE AYE TRIBUTE -- AT I I JUST THINK THAT NOW WE HAVE -- STAFF IS. BETTER TO SAY THAT WE'RE VERY HAPPY. IT'S A IT'S GIVES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR STAFF -- TO TO PERFORM THEIR ABILITY WITHOUT. SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE FACE THE WITH. IN THE PAST AND AT CENTCOM. I'M GLAD THAT YOU BROUGHT THAT UP BECAUSE I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND THINK ABOUT. CONTINUING THESE COMPLICATIONS AS WELL SALUTE SO APPRECIATE YOU MENTIONING THAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. OPEN UP PUBLIC COMMENT. OKAY RECOMMENDATIONS TO PROVE HIS PROPOSED -- IS OUR MOTION.

OF ONE OF THE NOTES IN THE ANALYSIS IT IT IT POINTS OUT OF THAT THERE IS -- THIS OTHER PROGRAM TO LOCAL PREPAID M. T. S. -- COLLECTION ACT OF THAT ACTUALLY IS A PROGRAM THAT WE AT THE LEGAL LIKE TO SEE CONTINUED -- IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO DIRECTLY WITH THIS WITH THIS DECISION THAT WAS REFERENCED -- WHAT THE ISSUE INVOLVES IS ON WHEN YOU -- WHEN YOU HAVE A CELL PHONE LIKE THE US IN YOU AND THE LOCAL CITY OR COUNTY HAS UTILITY USERS TAX YOU OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A WAY FOR THE CITY OR COUNTY TO COLLECT THE U.
