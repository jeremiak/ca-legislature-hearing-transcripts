ANY SETTLEMENT REVENUES. IT

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:30.983
WOULD ENCOURAGE LOCAL

GOVERNMENTS WHO FILED OPIOID

00:12:32.618 --> 00:12:34.653

ALSO BE SUBJECT TO LEGISLATIVE

APPROPRIATION. THESE PROVISIONS

00:12:55.307 --> 00:12:56.742

PRINCIPLE- REASON FOR AB SIX-

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.876
IS THE OPIOIDS I SETTLEMENT

00:13:30.943 --> 00:13:32.845
THAT. A MONTH AGO I WOULD HAVE

00:13:32.912 --> 00:13:34.847
TOLD YOU THAT WE WORK-

00:13:34.914 --> 00:13:36.849
CONTINUING TO TRY BUT NO REAL

00:13:36.916 --> 00:13:38.284
SIGNS THAT WE WERE ON THE

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:41.453
HORIZON OF SUCCESS THERE ARE

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.688
THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED LAWSUITS BY

00:13:42.755 --> 00:13:45.357
GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES STATES

00:13:45.424 --> 00:13:46.559
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COUNTIES AND

00:13:46.625 --> 00:13:49.728
CITIES TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS AND

00:13:49.795 --> 00:13:52.264
THE TERRITORIES WHO ARE SUING

00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:54.300
ANY NUMBER OF DEFENDANTS-

00:13:54.366 --> 00:13:55.901
DEALING WITH OPIOIDS

00:13:55.968 --> 00:13:59.038
MANUFACTURERS DISTRIBUTORS

00:13:59.104 --> 00:14:01.140
PHARMACIST. WE ARE ON THE CUSP

00:14:01.207 --> 00:14:03.475
OF A SETTLEMENT WITH A NUMBER

00:14:03.542 --> 00:14:06.412
OF THOSE MAJOR- DEFENDANTS

00:14:06.478 --> 00:14:09.548
THAT- ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO WE

00:14:09.615 --> 00:14:11.917
SUBMITTED A DEMAND AND TO THEM

00:14:11.984 --> 00:14:14.186
AND WE RECEIVED A COUNTER WHICH

00:14:14.253 --> 00:14:17.623
WAS. I THINK A LOT OF US A

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:20.326
LEGITIMATE SERIOUS COUNTER

00:14:20.392 --> 00:14:21.594
WHICH GIVES OF THE US THE

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.762
PROSPECT OF SETTLING. AND

00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:26.165
HERE'S THE IMPORTANT PART. FOR

00:14:26.232 --> 00:14:28.667
US TO SETTLE THIRTY FIVE

00:14:28.734 --> 00:14:30.502
HUNDRED LAWSUITS AND TO SETTLE

00:14:30.569 --> 00:14:33.205
THE FIFTY FOR THE FIFTY EIGHT

00:14:33.272 --> 00:14:34.573
COUNTIES WHO HAVE SET UP FILE

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:37.543
LAWSUITS THE TWENTY FIVE OR THE

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:38.544
TWENTY SIX MAJOR CITIES WILL

00:14:38.611 --> 00:14:40.913
FILE LAWSUITS IN CALIFORNIA. WE

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.314
OUGHT TO COME TOGETHER BECAUSE

00:14:42.381 --> 00:14:43.749
THE ONLY WAY THESE SETTLEMENTS

00:14:43.816 --> 00:14:45.618
WORK IS IF THE DEFENDANTS AS A

00:14:45.684 --> 00:14:48.120
RESULT OF SETTLING CLAIMS HAVE

00:14:48.187 --> 00:14:49.622
WHAT THEY CALL GLOBAL PEACE

00:14:49.688 --> 00:14:50.756
THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT

00:14:50.823 --> 00:14:53.058
BEING BLINDSIDED BY LAWSUIT. SO

00:14:53.125 --> 00:14:54.893
AB FIVE BECOMES IMPORTANT

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.696
BECAUSE IT CARRIES FORWARD- A

00:14:57.763 --> 00:14:59.265
PROVISION IT'S ABOUT FOUR

00:14:59.331 --> 00:15:00.666
PARAGRAPHS THAT THE MAIN PARTS

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:02.534
OF THE AB SIX THAT OCCURRED

00:15:02.601 --> 00:15:03.535
LATE TO OPIATES THAT ARE

00:15:03.602 --> 00:15:07.606
IMPORTANT. ONE IT SAYS THAT IF

00:15:07.673 --> 00:15:09.942
THERE IS A SETTLEMENT. IT HAS

00:15:10.009 --> 00:15:11.543
TO CONTINUE TO TERM IN THERE

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:13.545
THAT SAYS THAT MOVING FORWARD

00:15:13.612 --> 00:15:14.980
NO OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN THE

00:15:15.047 --> 00:15:16.949
STATE WILL BE FILING NEW CLAIMS

00:15:17.016 --> 00:15:18.017
BECAUSE IT WOULD MAKE IT

00:15:18.083 --> 00:15:20.119
POSSIBLE T. CLOSE THE DEAL IF

00:15:20.185 --> 00:15:22.288
DEFENDANTS ARE STILL SEEN NEW

00:15:22.354 --> 00:15:23.155
CLAIM BEING FILED AGAINST

00:15:23.222 --> 00:15:24.957
IMPACT THEIR PEACE PLAN SIDE.

00:15:25.024 --> 00:15:27.059
SECONDLY IT ALSO SAYS THAT

00:15:27.126 --> 00:15:28.427
NOTHING TAKES EFFECT UNTIL

00:15:28.494 --> 00:15:30.629
SETTLEMENT IS AN ACTIVE AND THE

00:15:30.696 --> 00:15:32.131
SETTLEMENT AND THE TERMS OF THE

00:15:32.197 --> 00:15:33.666
SETTLEMENT WILL DRIVE HOW THIS

00:15:33.732 --> 00:15:36.302
IS. HOW THE- ANY RESOURCES ARE

00:15:36.368 --> 00:15:37.569
DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE

00:15:37.636 --> 00:15:38.971
STATE TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:15:39.038 --> 00:15:40.372
AND TO THAT END TO THE STATE

00:15:40.439 --> 00:15:42.841
GOVERNMENT AND SO I HOPE THAT-

00:15:42.908 --> 00:15:43.742
ALONG WITH THE OTHER IMPORT

00:15:43.809 --> 00:15:46.178
PROVISIONS. THAT THE CENTERS

00:15:46.245 --> 00:15:47.413
WILL RECOGNIZE WE HAVE A CHANCE

00:15:47.479 --> 00:15:49.748
ACTUALLY THREE. WHAT HAS BEEN

00:15:49.815 --> 00:15:52.017
A- DECADES LONG PROBLEM WITH

00:15:52.084 --> 00:15:54.219
OPIOIDS AND NOW PROVIDE RELIEF

00:15:54.286 --> 00:15:55.387
AT A TIME QUITE HONESTLY WHERE

00:15:55.454 --> 00:15:57.356
I THINK MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:15:57.423 --> 00:15:59.858
AND THE STATE ARE STRAPPED

00:15:59.925 --> 00:16:00.659
TRYING TO PROVIDE. DECENT

00:16:00.726 --> 00:16:01.927
HEALTHCARE TO A LOT OF

00:16:01.994 --> 00:16:03.696
CALIFORNIA SO LET ME STOP THERE

00:16:03.762 --> 00:16:05.164
HE QUESTIONS ON OPIOIDS OR

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:06.198
ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO

LET ME TRY THE OTHER ROUTE

00:23:03.749 --> 00:23:05.283
HERE- CENTER BECAUSE YOU

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:06.985
PROBABLY GOT A GOOD POINT HE

00:23:07.052 --> 00:23:08.854
WOULD NOT BE CONSISTENT IN IT

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.655
WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE FOR THE

00:23:10.722 --> 00:23:12.624
ATTORNEY FOR A STATE AGENCY TO

00:23:12.691 --> 00:23:13.458
BE DOING SOMETHING OTHER THAN

00:23:13.525 --> 00:23:15.393
WHAT THE STATE AGENCY SETS. AND

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:18.263
THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE TO REALLY-

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:19.765
ABIDE BY OUR FIDUCIARY

00:23:19.831 --> 00:23:22.000
RESPONSIBILITY AS WE- PROTECT

00:23:22.067 --> 00:23:23.468
THE INTERESTS OF OUR CLIENTS

00:23:23.535 --> 00:23:24.469
AND SO I DON'T THINK YOU'VE

00:23:24.536 --> 00:23:25.771
EVER YOU COULD PROBABLY EVER

00:23:25.837 --> 00:23:26.838
BRING UP THE CASE IN YOUR

00:23:26.905 --> 00:23:28.073
MEMORY WHERE YOU'VE SEEN THE

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:29.474
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE BE AT

00:23:29.541 --> 00:23:31.376
ODDS WITH THE STATE AGENCY

00:23:31.443 --> 00:23:34.546
CLIENT- IN COURT. AND SO WHAT

00:23:34.613 --> 00:23:36.715
WE DON'T EXPECT THAT TO HAPPEN

00:23:36.782 --> 00:23:37.315
BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S

00:23:37.382 --> 00:23:39.317
CLEAR THAT. IF OUR STATE AGENCY

00:23:39.384 --> 00:23:41.520
CLIENT FOR EXAMPLE IS IT GOING

00:23:41.586 --> 00:23:42.187
TO GET INVOLVED IN A PARTICULAR

00:23:42.254 --> 00:23:44.856
MATTER. THAT IT DOESN'T-

00:23:44.923 --> 00:23:46.591
PRECLUDED ATTORNEY GENERAL'S

00:23:46.658 --> 00:23:48.093
OFFICE FROM BEING ABLE TO TAKE

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:52.397
ACTION TO INITIATE ACTION. IF

OUR EIGHT STAGES. FINE IS NOT A

00:23:53.999 --> 00:23:55.100
VOTERS. AND WE DON'T WANT IT TO

00:23:55.167 --> 00:23:56.134
BE PERCEIVED THAT NO YOU CAN'T

00:23:56.201 --> 00:23:57.636
DO THAT BECAUSE YOU STAGE IT

00:23:57.702 --> 00:23:59.204
AGENCY CLIENT. IS A DAY IN THAT

00:23:59.271 --> 00:24:00.672
ACTUALLY SO LET E EXPLAIN.

00:24:00.739 --> 00:24:02.307
THOUGH THERE THE PUT THAT.

00:24:02.374 --> 00:24:04.543
EXPLANATION COULD POINT ON WHAT

00:24:04.609 --> 00:24:07.712
I JUST SAID. I AM A THE STATE

00:24:07.779 --> 00:24:09.381
PROSECUTOR. FOR THE PEOPLE OF

00:24:09.447 --> 00:24:12.284
CALIFORNIA. WE ALSO HAVE FIFTY

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:13.652
EIGHT OTHER LOCAL PROSECUTORS

00:24:13.718 --> 00:24:16.488
THE DA'S IN OUR FIFTY ACCOUNTS.

00:24:16.555 --> 00:24:18.023
THE SAME STATUTE THAT WE'RE

00:24:18.089 --> 00:24:19.090
REFERRING TO THAT WE'RE TRYING

00:24:19.157 --> 00:24:22.260
TO CLEAN UP PROVIDES TO THOSE

00:24:22.327 --> 00:24:24.262
FIFTY EIGHT DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.

00:24:24.329 --> 00:24:25.430
THE SAME POWERS THAT I'M

00:24:25.497 --> 00:24:27.098
TELLING YOU THAT WE'RE TRYING

00:24:27.165 --> 00:24:28.900

IS TO TAKE INDEPENDENT ACTION

00:24:31.102 --> 00:24:32.838
REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE STATE

00:24:32.904 --> 00:24:36.041
AGENCY FISH AND WILDLIFE SAYS

00:24:36.107 --> 00:24:38.143
AND SO IT WOULD BE INCONGRUOUS.

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:40.212
TO SAY THAT ANYONE OF THE FIFTY

00:24:40.278 --> 00:24:41.179
EIGHT DISTRICT ATTORNEYS HAVE

00:24:41.246 --> 00:24:42.581
THE INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY TO

FIFTY EIGHT DISTRICT ATTORNEYS

WOULD NOT SO WHAT WE'RE SIMPLY

00:24:55.594 --> 00:24:57.429
TRYING TO DO IS CLARIFY THAT.

00:24:57.495 --> 00:25:00.365
THE WAY THIS STATE HAS TO WORK

00:25:00.432 --> 00:25:01.399
AGP REPRESENTING ALL STATE

00:25:01.466 --> 00:25:03.401
AGENCIES SHOULD NOT UNDERMINE

00:25:03.468 --> 00:25:04.970
THE INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY THAT

00:25:05.036 --> 00:25:06.638
THE CONSTITUTION GIVES. TO THE

00:25:06.705 --> 00:25:07.906
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE BUT

SETTLEMENT IN WITH THE BILL

00:26:37.395 --> 00:26:39.331

BELIEVE IMPACT RURAL CALIFORNIA

00:26:41.366 --> 00:26:44.102

00:26:44.169 --> 00:26:45.503
WATER ROSE I GET WHAT YOU'RE

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:46.771

BE THE AG FOREVER AND SO I GET

00:27:01.619 --> 00:27:02.654
CONCERNED ABOUT HOW WE'RE

00:27:02.721 --> 00:27:04.155
SETTING UP THE SYSTEM AND RIGHT

00:27:04.222 --> 00:27:06.491
NOW IT REQUIRES. VISION AND

00:27:06.558 --> 00:27:10.028
MYLIFE TO- ACTUALLY INSTITUTED

DO AN INVESTIGATION- AND ANY AS

00:27:13.932 --> 00:27:14.332
YOU SAID YOU CAN DO IT

00:27:14.399 --> 00:27:15.100
SEPARATELY BUT UT IT REALLY

00:27:15.166 --> 00:27:20.772
IS. IS THROUGH THE AT THE A GS

00:27:20.839 --> 00:27:22.741
SEVEN OF THE FISH AND WILDLIFE.

00:27:22.807 --> 00:27:24.442
I'M A AND THERE THERE'S GREAT

00:27:24.509 --> 00:27:26.177
CONSTERNATION ABOUT WHAT WE'RE

00:27:26.244 --> 00:27:27.278
WHAT WE'RE REALLY DOING HERE

00:27:27.345 --> 00:27:30.515
AND WHETHER IT'S A GREAT

00:27:30.582 --> 00:27:31.149
EXPANSION OF THE AUTHOROF YOUR

00:27:31.216 --> 00:27:33.018
OFFICE TO GO INTO. AN AREA

00:27:33.084 --> 00:27:36.988
WHERE- THERE MAY BE A CONFLICT

00:27:37.055 --> 00:27:41.326
IN TERMS OF HOW- AND HOW THE

00:27:41.393 --> 00:27:46.431
SITUATION OCCURRED IN AND SOME

00:27:46.498 --> 00:27:48.333
OF THE BIGGER PICTURES WHICH IS

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.502
ARE WE- ARE WE REALLY

00:27:50.568 --> 00:27:53.972
RESTRICTING. FLOWS AND IS THIS

00:27:54.039 --> 00:27:57.876
A SITUATION THAT- THAT REQUIRES

00:27:57.942 --> 00:28:00.211
THE AG TO COME AND SO I JUST I

00:28:00.278 --> 00:28:01.179
HAVE GREAT CONCERNS ABOUT

00:28:01.246 --> 00:28:03.181
PUTTING THESE TWO TOGETHER

00:28:03.248 --> 00:28:04.449
NUMBER ONE AND I'VE HEARD. MY

00:28:04.516 --> 00:28:06.651
PHONE HAS BLOWN UP OVER THIS

00:28:06.718 --> 00:28:08.853
PARTICULAR ISSUE BECAUSE-

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:10.855
BECAUSE IT IS CREATING GREAT

00:28:10.922 --> 00:28:12.824
ANXIETY IN ROCK CALIFORNIA AND

00:28:12.891 --> 00:28:14.159
SO I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU

00:28:14.225 --> 00:28:15.460
KNOW THAT I'M NOT SURE WE HAVE

00:28:15.527 --> 00:28:17.996
HI. I'M NOT SURE I AGREE WITH

00:28:18.063 --> 00:28:22.233
THAT THE- THE ANALYSIS THAT

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:24.335
IT'S AN EXPANSION THAT IT'S NOT

00:28:24.402 --> 00:28:25.703
AN EXPANSION THAT IS IT JUST

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:29.941
CLARIFYING AND SO THAT'S THAT.

00:28:30.008 --> 00:28:32.877
I GUESS. THAT'S MY CONCERN.

00:28:32.944 --> 00:28:33.511
SENATOR EFFECTIVE AT IF I COULD

00:28:33.578 --> 00:28:34.112
HAVE QUICKLY TRY TO REACH. OR

00:28:34.179 --> 00:28:37.115
YES. YEAH SO CENTER THANK YOU

00:28:37.182 --> 00:28:40.218
FOR THE THAT THE COMMON. THE

00:28:40.285 --> 00:28:42.487
REASON THIS CAME UP. BECAUSE WE

00:28:42.554 --> 00:28:43.822
BELIEVE THAT THE PHARMACY JUST

00:28:43.888 --> 00:28:45.623
AS WE HAVE THAT IN A MINUTE

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:47.058
FORTY AND WE WOULD EXERCISE IT

00:28:47.125 --> 00:28:48.793
IF NECESSARY BUT WHAT WE WOULD

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.261
DO IS TRY TO EXERCISE AND WHEN

00:28:50.328 --> 00:28:52.497
WE HAVE A STATE AGENCY.THAT IS

00:28:52.564 --> 00:28:54.899
INVOLVED AND MAYBE TAKING A

00:28:54.966 --> 00:28:56.568
PARTICULAR POSITION BECAUSE

00:28:56.634 --> 00:28:58.169
AGAIN IT WOULD BE A VIOLATION

00:28:58.236 --> 00:28:59.571
OF OUR OF OUR FIDUCIARY

00:28:59.637 --> 00:29:01.539
RESPONSIBILITY WHAT WE'RE

00:29:01.606 --> 00:29:03.174
SAYING IS IF THAT AGENCY HADN'T

00:29:03.241 --> 00:29:06.978
SPOKEN OR IS. STANDING DOWN. WE

00:29:07.045 --> 00:29:07.979
DON'T WANT THE IMPRESSION TO BE

00:29:08.046 --> 00:29:11.082
THAT. FIFTY EIGHT D. A.'S. CAN

00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:12.650
GO AHEAD AND TAKE ACTION

00:29:12.717 --> 00:29:14.252
INDEPENDENTLY REGARDLESS EVEN

00:29:14.319 --> 00:29:16.554
IF THE- FISHING BY LIKE DECIDED

00:29:16.621 --> 00:29:18.523
TO WALK INTO THIS. BUT THE

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:19.824
STATE EIGHTY EIGHT G. WHO

00:29:19.891 --> 00:29:21.759
REPRESENTS THIS ALL OF THE

00:29:21.826 --> 00:29:23.661
OTHER PEOPLE CALIFORNIA. AND

00:29:23.728 --> 00:29:25.964
ALL OF ITS RESOURCES- WHILE

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:27.832
EACH D. A. CAN ONLY REPRESENT

00:29:27.899 --> 00:29:30.502
THOSE IN HIS- COUNTY. CAT AND

00:29:30.568 --> 00:29:31.903
SO THAT WOULD BE AN

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:34.305
INCONSISTENCY AND WHAT WE'RE

00:29:34.372 --> 00:29:36.207
TRYING TO DO IS AVOID. THE LAW

00:29:36.274 --> 00:29:38.376
HAVING THESE INCONSISTENCIES

00:29:38.443 --> 00:29:40.211
BECAUSE A CASE WAS PRODUCT

00:29:40.278 --> 00:29:41.946
WHERE THERE WAS NOT A AN ISSUE

00:29:42.013 --> 00:29:43.815
BECAUSE WE REPRESENTED. THE

00:29:43.882 --> 00:29:45.717
DEPARTMENT- AND THERE WAS NO

00:29:45.783 --> 00:29:48.520
CONFLICT BUT THE QUESTION

00:29:48.586 --> 00:29:51.923
AROSE. HOW IS IT THAT DJS CAN

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:54.058
GO AHEAD AND ACT INDEPENDENTLY

00:29:54.125 --> 00:29:56.194
BUT THE SUPERVISOR. OF THE

00:29:56.261 --> 00:29:57.929
STATE'S PROSECUTOR CAN'T DO

00:29:57.996 --> 00:29:59.364
WITH FIFTY PROSECUTORS CAN DO

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:01.166
UNDER THE SAME LAW AND SO WE'RE

00:30:01.232 --> 00:30:02.066
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS

00:30:02.133 --> 00:30:04.569
AVOID THERE BEING. A AN

00:30:04.636 --> 00:30:06.271
INCONSISTENCY AND THAT'S WHY AS

00:30:06.337 --> 00:30:07.505
I SAID IT'S REALLY A CLEAN UP

00:30:07.572 --> 00:30:08.973
LIKE WE BELIEVE WE HAVE THE

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.609
AUTHORITY TO DO THIS- BUT WHY

00:30:11.676 --> 00:30:13.478
HAVE IT BE CLOUDED BY. THIS

00:30:13.545 --> 00:30:17.749
SENSE THAT IT'S NOT QUITE CLEAR

00:30:17.815 --> 00:30:18.316
AND ONE FINAL CLARIFICATION

00:30:18.383 --> 00:30:20.618

SETTLEMENT I WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:30:24.289 --> 00:30:25.990
IT'S CLEAR WE DON'T YET HAVE A

00:30:26.057 --> 00:30:28.526
DEAL. WHAT WE HAVE IS

00:30:28.593 --> 00:30:30.061
NEGOTIATIONS WHERE WE MADE IT

00:30:30.128 --> 00:30:31.930
DEMAND AS THE PLAINTIFF

WE'RE NOW ON THE CUSP OF

00:30:40.905 --> 00:30:42.807
GETTING A SETTLEMENT. AND THIS

00:30:42.874 --> 00:30:44.842

DEAL FORTY IN A WAY THAT LETS

00:30:46.244 --> 00:30:49.047
CALIFORNIA START TO CLAIM. THE

00:30:49.113 --> 00:30:50.715
RESOURCES THAT WOULD BE PART OF

00:30:50.782 --> 00:30:51.983
THAT SETTLEMENT THAT WOULD BE

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:57.388
ENTITLED. TO OUR STATE AND

APPRECIATE THE DISTINCTION

00:31:02.994 --> 00:31:07.098
BETWEEN HAVING UP A SETTLEMENT

00:31:07.165 --> 00:31:08.299

00:31:08.366 --> 00:31:09.801
YOU NEED TO THIRTY AT THIS

00:31:09.867 --> 00:31:11.469
PARTICULAR POINT TO DO IT.

00:31:11.536 --> 00:31:13.171
NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO IS-

00:31:13.238 --> 00:31:15.139
THE LETTERS THAT I RECEIVED IN

00:31:15.206 --> 00:31:16.341
OPPOSITION FROM LOCAL

00:31:16.407 --> 00:31:19.043
GOVERNMENT ARE CONCERNED THAT.

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:21.112
THAT THEY WILL NOT RECEIVE

00:31:21.179 --> 00:31:22.480
COMPENSATION FOR THEIR

EXPANDED UP TO THIS POINT- MY

00:31:26.284 --> 00:31:29.587
FROM MY UNDERSTANDING FROM WHAT

00:31:29.654 --> 00:31:30.221
YOU SAID IS IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT

00:31:30.288 --> 00:31:30.888
THERE WOULD THAT THERE WOULD BE

00:31:30.955 --> 00:31:33.591
A PER. FOR EXPENSES THAT HAVE

00:31:33.658 --> 00:31:36.261
ALREADY BEEN PAID BUT IF YOU

COULD ANSWER THAT FOR ME PLEASE

00:31:36.995 --> 00:31:40.198
THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL. YES

00:31:40.265 --> 00:31:43.268
THE- THE NEED IS BASED ON THE

00:31:43.334 --> 00:31:46.237
FACT THAT. THE DEFENDANTS HAVE

00:31:46.304 --> 00:31:49.274
THE WAY THIS WILL WORK IS THAT.

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:51.042
THE MORE THE DEFENDANTS HAVE

00:31:51.109 --> 00:31:53.011
ASSURANCE THAT THEY WILL NOT

00:31:53.077 --> 00:31:55.613

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.482
FROM THESE PLAINTIFF GOVERNMENT

THE SENATE THE MORE THEY WILL

00:32:14.265 --> 00:32:16.634
LET GO THE RESOURCES THAT THEY

ARE OFFERING TO SETTLE THE

00:32:17.769 --> 00:32:22.840
CASE. BUT LESS. ASSURANCE THEY

GOVERNMENTS WILL RECEIVE FROM

00:32:31.616 --> 00:32:33.885
THE POT SO ESSENTIALLY. OUR OUR

00:32:33.951 --> 00:32:36.354
STATE OUR CITIES ARE COUNTIES

00:32:36.421 --> 00:32:38.189
AND THE STATE. WILL BE HELD

00:32:38.256 --> 00:32:41.959
HOSTAGE. BY ANY LOCAL

00:32:42.026 --> 00:32:42.560
GOVERNMENTS THAT HAVE NOT YET

00:32:42.627 --> 00:32:44.962
SUIT. BUT WHO MAY WANT US TO

00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:46.764
INTO THE FUTURE AND THE

00:32:46.831 --> 00:32:49.467
DEFENDANTS WILL SAY. WE HAVE TO

00:32:49.534 --> 00:32:51.602
FACE THE PROSPECT OF NEW

00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:53.271
COUNTIES AND CITIES TRYING TO

00:32:53.338 --> 00:32:55.373
SUE IN CALIFORNIA AND THEREFORE

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:55.940
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HOLD

00:32:56.007 --> 00:32:56.908
BACK SOME OF THE CITY AND

00:32:56.974 --> 00:32:57.942
COUNTY MONEY AND THE STATE

00:32:58.009 --> 00:33:01.145
MONEY. BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW

00:33:01.212 --> 00:33:01.746
WHAT WILL HAPPEN AND WE DON'T

00:33:01.813 --> 00:33:02.380
WANT TO TAKE THAT RISK THAT WE

00:33:02.447 --> 00:33:03.214
LAID OUT ALL THIS MONEY AND WE

00:33:03.281 --> 00:33:04.382
STILL END UP WITH LAWSUITS

00:33:04.449 --> 00:33:07.085
AGAINST US SO WE HAVE TO TRY TO

00:33:07.151 --> 00:33:09.954
EQUAL LIBERALIZED EQ. GET IN A

00:33:10.021 --> 00:33:14.359
GLITTERING HERE WHERE. ARE THE

00:33:14.425 --> 00:33:15.927
DEFENDANTS YET THE ISSUE OF.

00:33:15.993 --> 00:33:17.528
SIXTEEN DISTINGUISHING AGAINST

00:33:17.595 --> 00:33:19.797
THEM AND WE EVEN GET THE

00:33:19.864 --> 00:33:20.998
RESOURCES THAT ARE BEING

00:33:21.065 --> 00:33:22.800
COMMITTED IN THE SUMMIT SO WE

00:33:22.867 --> 00:33:25.503
CAN ADDRESS THE OPIOID CRISIS

00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:27.505
AND SO THIS LEGISLATION IS

00:33:27.572 --> 00:33:28.573
SOMETHING SUPPOSED JUST FOUR

00:33:28.639 --> 00:33:30.274
PARAGRAPHS AND YOU CAN I CAN

00:33:30.341 --> 00:33:33.478
REDO THE PARAGRAPH THAT SPEAKS

00:33:33.544 --> 00:33:34.112
TO IT. IT'S VERY SIMPLE JUST AS

00:33:34.178 --> 00:33:35.813
THIS. AUGUST TWENTY FOURTH

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.482
TWENTY TWENTY. IF YOU HAVE

00:33:37.548 --> 00:33:42.253
FILED. A LAWSUIT ALREADY. YEAH

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.822
COUNTY OR CITY OR STATE. YOU

00:33:44.889 --> 00:33:48.426
CAN DECIDE. IF YOU WANT TO

00:33:48.493 --> 00:33:49.026
PARTICIPATE IN THE SETTLEMENT

00:33:49.093 --> 00:33:49.694
OR NOT AND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO

00:33:49.761 --> 00:33:50.294
YOU CAN CONTINUE WITH YOUR

00:33:50.361 --> 00:33:51.996
LAWSUIT MOM FOR WE CAN'T STOP

00:33:52.063 --> 00:33:53.398
THAT THIS BUDGET LEGISLATION

00:33:53.464 --> 00:33:55.333
DOESN'T BOB BUT IF YOU HAVEN'T

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:57.402
ALREADY FILED A LAWSUIT HAVING

00:33:57.468 --> 00:34:00.605
MADE A CLAIM OF LEGAL CLAIMS

00:34:00.671 --> 00:34:01.139
AGAINST. THESE PARTICULAR

00:34:01.205 --> 00:34:03.941
DEFENDANTS. YOU CAN'T. IF THIS

00:34:04.008 --> 00:34:05.309
BILL PASSES AND THERE'S A

00:34:05.376 --> 00:34:06.244
SETTLEMENT THAT'S RICH AND THE

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:07.311
SETTLEMENT HAS TO BE REACHED

00:34:07.378 --> 00:34:08.379
JUST JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE THE

00:34:08.446 --> 00:34:10.214
BILL DOESN'T WORK AT THE AT TO

00:34:10.281 --> 00:34:11.849
GET THE SETTLEMENT IN PLACE.

00:34:11.916 --> 00:34:13.551
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO FILE A NEW

00:34:13.618 --> 00:34:15.219
LAWSUIT. BECAUSE THAT WOULD

00:34:15.286 --> 00:34:16.921
CREATE THE UNCERTAINTY FOR THE

00:34:16.988 --> 00:34:18.256
DEFENDANTS THAT WOULD HOLE

00:34:18.322 --> 00:34:19.624
CAUSED THEM TO HOLD BACK THE

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:21.659
MONEY. AND SO THIS LEGISLATION

00:34:21.726 --> 00:34:23.795
IF IT BECOMES LAW LET'S JUST

00:34:23.861 --> 00:34:26.564
QUICKLY RESOLVE CASES THAT ARE

00:34:26.631 --> 00:34:28.299
OUT THERE THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED

00:34:28.366 --> 00:34:30.802
LAWSUITS ALREADY. FILED MANY

00:34:30.868 --> 00:34:32.370
MORE THAT COULD BE FILED BY

00:34:32.437 --> 00:34:33.404
OTHER COUNTIES AND CITIES

00:34:33.471 --> 00:34:35.139
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. AND SO

00:34:35.206 --> 00:34:38.242
WHAT THIS DOES IS FOR THOSE WHO

00:34:38.309 --> 00:34:38.876

YOU WON'T BE ARE FOUND THE

00:34:39.977 --> 00:34:41.179

00:34:44.515 --> 00:34:45.416
SETTLEMENT AND GET YOUR FAIR

00:34:45.483 --> 00:34:48.553

YOU. THANK YOU WILL GO NEXT TO

00:34:54.392 --> 00:34:56.561
A SENATOR BELL FOLLOWED BY

00:34:56.627 --> 00:35:03.234
SENATOR MORLOCK. I'M CONCERNED

00:35:03.301 --> 00:35:04.635
ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE OF

00:35:04.702 --> 00:35:06.103
CALIFORNIA THEY'VE BEEN HARMED

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:11.142
DIRECTLY. BY THE OPIOID AND

00:35:11.209 --> 00:35:15.880
DRUG ABUSE CRISIS AND AS- MOST

00:35:15.947 --> 00:35:18.549
OF YOU KNOW AND- MY CAREER IN

00:35:18.616 --> 00:35:21.352
THE LEGISLATURE. HAVE BEEN THE

00:35:21.419 --> 00:35:23.154
ONE TO FORM THE ALCOHOL AND

00:35:23.221 --> 00:35:26.724
DRUG ABUSE- SELECT COMMITTEE IN

00:35:26.791 --> 00:35:28.159
THE ASSEMBLY. AND THEN- THE

00:35:28.226 --> 00:35:29.927
SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

00:35:29.994 --> 00:35:30.661
MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE

00:35:30.728 --> 00:35:35.366
ABUSE- WE'VE BEEN. WORKING ON

00:35:35.433 --> 00:35:39.370
THIS ISSUE- FOR SOME TIME SO MY

00:35:39.437 --> 00:35:41.939
PERSPECTIVE IS. THAT DOES IT

00:35:42.006 --> 00:35:44.842
HAVE BEEN HARMED IN CALIFORNIA

00:35:44.909 --> 00:35:49.280
ONLY 10% OF THEM ACTUALLY

00:35:49.347 --> 00:35:51.516
RECEIVE. SERVICES NECESSARY

00:35:51.582 --> 00:35:55.686
THAT MEANS AND 90% DO NOT

00:35:55.753 --> 00:35:58.256
RECEIVE SERVICES SO THE

00:35:58.322 --> 00:35:58.723
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A

00:35:58.789 --> 00:36:03.594
SETTLEMENT. IS SOMETHING THAT

00:36:03.661 --> 00:36:05.363
WOULD BE BENEFICIAL I THINK TO

00:36:05.429 --> 00:36:07.532
A LOT OF PEOPLE IF IT WAS DONE

00:36:07.598 --> 00:36:08.065
RIGHT THAT'S THE POINT I'M

00:36:08.132 --> 00:36:11.402
GOING TO MAKE SURE. FOR MANY.

00:36:11.469 --> 00:36:13.804
DECADES ACTUALLY. THE STATE OF

00:36:13.871 --> 00:36:17.408
CALIFORNIA. THE REALIGNMENT.

00:36:17.475 --> 00:36:18.876
THROUGH ELIMINATING THEIR

00:36:18.943 --> 00:36:20.278
ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSE

00:36:20.344 --> 00:36:22.947
DEPARTMENT IN TWENTY THIRTEEN-

00:36:23.014 --> 00:36:26.751
THROUGH- LEGISLATION. HAS

00:36:26.817 --> 00:36:28.586
BASICALLY SAID THAT THE

00:36:28.653 --> 00:36:30.454
COUNTIES NOT THE STATE

00:36:30.521 --> 00:36:33.291
GOVERNMENT. ARE THE MAIN

00:36:33.357 --> 00:36:35.760
RESPONSIBLE PARTY FOR PROVIDING

00:36:35.826 --> 00:36:42.266
SERVICES. TO PEOPLE AFFLICTED

00:36:42.333 --> 00:36:44.569
WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND

00:36:44.635 --> 00:36:47.939
NEEDHAM'S NEED OF SERVICES SO

00:36:48.005 --> 00:36:50.007
THAT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE

00:36:50.074 --> 00:36:50.575
EMERGENCY ROOM WHEN YOU TALK

00:36:50.641 --> 00:36:53.544
ABOUT THE CLINICS WE TALK ABOUT

00:36:53.611 --> 00:36:56.213
THE DRUG ABUSE PROGRAMS. DO WE

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:57.214
TALK ABOUT THE COMMUNITY

00:36:57.281 --> 00:36:58.616
ORGANIZATIONS A LOT OF THOSE

00:36:58.683 --> 00:37:01.852
ORGANIZATIONS. OUR FUNDED

00:37:01.919 --> 00:37:04.789
COORDINATED BY THE COUNTIES SO

00:37:04.855 --> 00:37:05.423
WHAT I'M SAYING IS THE COUNTIES

00:37:05.489 --> 00:37:07.892
HAVE. A MUCH GREATER

00:37:07.959 --> 00:37:12.063
UNDERSTANDING OF THE AFFLICTION.

00:37:12.129 --> 00:37:15.600
THAT THIS SETTLEMENT ENTAILS SO

00:37:15.666 --> 00:37:18.235
MY QUESTION TO ATTORNEY GENERAL

00:37:18.302 --> 00:37:18.970
IS GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE

00:37:19.036 --> 00:37:25.242
STATE HAS. IN SOME CASES NOT.

00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:27.612
BEEN VERY ASSERTIVE AND DEALING

00:37:27.678 --> 00:37:30.848
WITH THE OPIOID CRISIS. WHY

00:37:30.915 --> 00:37:36.420
SHOULD THE COUNTY SB. NOT

00:37:36.487 --> 00:37:37.788
CONSIDERED EQUAL PARTNERS AT

00:37:37.855 --> 00:37:40.558
LEAST AND DEVELOPMENT OF A

00:37:40.625 --> 00:37:43.728
SETTLEMENT. AND WHEN I HEARD

00:37:43.794 --> 00:37:45.196
THE SETTLEMENT SPLIT I WAS

00:37:45.262 --> 00:37:47.231
SURPRISED BECAUSE I THINK THAT

00:37:47.298 --> 00:37:49.967
THE COUNTIES. ARE THE ONES THAT

00:37:50.034 --> 00:37:53.270
ARE PROVIDING. THE ACTUAL

00:37:53.337 --> 00:37:56.307
SERVICE TO PEOPLE I REMEMBER

00:37:56.374 --> 00:37:59.110
MYSELF AS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR

00:37:59.176 --> 00:38:00.678
FOR TWELVE YEARS BEEN

00:38:00.745 --> 00:38:02.513
THREATENED WITH BEING ARRESTED

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:04.415
BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHEN

00:38:04.482 --> 00:38:06.417
WE ESTABLISH A NEEDLE EXCHANGE

00:38:06.484 --> 00:38:10.087
PROGRAM. THEY THREATENED TO

00:38:10.154 --> 00:38:12.523
ARREST US IMPORTANCE IS JAIL.

THE WAY AND ALL OF THAT 15% 50%

00:40:42.072 --> 00:40:43.741
SURE THAT EACH OF THE- LOCAL

00:40:47.311 --> 00:40:48.579
DETERMINED BY HOW MUCH

00:40:48.646 --> 00:40:49.914
PARTICIPATION THE REASON THE

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:51.849
SETTLEMENT THE MORE THAT THEIR

00:40:51.916 --> 00:40:54.318
OUTSTANDING- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:40:54.385 --> 00:40:55.986

GOVERNMENTS IN THE STATE WE GET

00:41:03.327 --> 00:41:05.863
AND SO THAT'S WHY UNITS

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:06.497
IMPORTANT HAVE THIS BILL. SO WE

00:41:06.564 --> 00:41:07.064
GET MOVING IN GET EVERY ON

00:41:07.131 --> 00:41:08.365
BOARD THAT WATCHED. THOSE THAT

00:41:08.432 --> 00:41:09.700
DON'T WANT TO AS I SAY WHO

00:41:09.767 --> 00:41:11.068
FORTY FATHER COMES IN COULD

00:41:11.135 --> 00:41:12.670
MOVE FORWARD BUT IF YOU'LL

00:41:12.736 --> 00:41:14.271
NOTICE TO YOUR POINT BECAUSE

00:41:14.338 --> 00:41:16.307
YOU'RE RIGHT- OFTENTIMES LOCAL

00:41:16.373 --> 00:41:18.075
GOVERNMENT HAS FELT LIKE IT'S

00:41:18.142 --> 00:41:21.078
BEEN. SHORT CHANGED BY THE

00:41:21.145 --> 00:41:22.613
STATE. THE MONEY. ARE ABATEMENT

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:25.216
PROGRAMS. MOST OF THOSE

00:41:25.282 --> 00:41:28.285
MITIGATION PROGRAMS ON OPIOIDS

00:41:28.352 --> 00:41:28.786
ARE RUN BY COUNTY HEALTH

00:41:28.853 --> 00:41:32.456
FACILITIES. NOT THE STATE AND

00:41:32.523 --> 00:41:33.524
SO AT THE END OF THE DAY

00:41:33.591 --> 00:41:35.125
BECAUSE OUR SETTLEMENT IS

00:41:35.192 --> 00:41:36.794
DICTATING THAT THE MONEY MUST

00:41:36.861 --> 00:41:40.497
BE SPENT ON OPIOID SERVICES

00:41:40.564 --> 00:41:44.335
ABATEMENT PREVENTION.

00:41:44.401 --> 00:41:44.935
MITIGATION SERVICES THOSE MY

00:41:45.002 --> 00:41:46.637
WILL HAVE TO END P IN THE

00:41:46.704 --> 00:41:47.905
HANDS OF THOSE WHO DO THOSE

00:41:47.972 --> 00:41:49.940
SERVICES AND THE STATE IS NOT

00:41:50.007 --> 00:41:51.575
IN THE BUSINESS OF DOING DAY TO

00:41:51.642 --> 00:41:55.512
DAY OPIOID WORK. COUNTY ARE

00:41:55.579 --> 00:41:57.314
HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS THAT DO IT

00:41:57.381 --> 00:41:58.549
EARLIER THIS THAT DOES THE

00:41:58.616 --> 00:42:04.889
STATE. BECAUSE OF ITS- NOT

00:42:04.955 --> 00:42:09.526
DIRECT ENGAGEMENT ON THE OPIOID.

00:42:09.593 --> 00:42:13.063
CRISIS IS GOING TO UNDER

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:18.002
ESTIMATE THE COST. AND THIS IS

00:42:18.068 --> 00:42:18.569
CONCERNING ME REGARDING THE

00:42:18.636 --> 00:42:22.973
SETTLEMENT BECAUSE I THINK IF

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:25.075
WE LOOK AT IT FROM A STANDPOINT

00:42:25.142 --> 00:42:27.912
OF WHAT KIND OF IMPACTS THEIR

00:42:27.978 --> 00:42:31.882
DIRECT AND INDIRECT IMPACTS. R.

00:42:31.949 --> 00:42:35.586
THE SETTLEMENT DOLLAR AMOUNTS-

00:42:35.653 --> 00:42:38.355
WE DON'T WANT TO BE TOO LOW.

00:42:38.422 --> 00:42:40.291
BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HARMED

00:42:40.357 --> 00:42:42.726
IN MANY LIFELONG MULTI

00:42:42.793 --> 00:42:46.463
GENERATIONAL WAYS. BECAUSE OF

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:51.001
THIS- FOR EXAMPLE. WHEN YOU GO

00:42:51.068 --> 00:42:52.903
AYE AYE VISIT MIKE TWENTY SIX

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:56.840
PRISONS. EVERY TIME I GO ASKED

00:42:56.907 --> 00:42:57.841
WARDENS HOW MANY OF PEOPLE ARE

00:42:57.908 --> 00:42:59.910
HERE BECAUSE OF MENTAL HEALTH

00:42:59.977 --> 00:43:02.846
OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE. AND HE SAID

00:43:02.913 --> 00:43:06.116
YOU KIDDING ALMOST ALL OF THEM.

00:43:06.183 --> 00:43:10.354
AND ALMOST EVERY WORD SAYS

00:43:10.421 --> 00:43:12.990
7590% YOU YOU YOU ARE AWARE AS

00:43:13.057 --> 00:43:15.259
YOU TURN GENERAL OF THIS. SO

00:43:15.326 --> 00:43:15.726
THE COST TO THE STATE

00:43:15.793 --> 00:43:18.262
GOVERNMENT. IN TERMS OF OUR

00:43:18.329 --> 00:43:20.698
PRISONS AND THE COUNTIES IN

TERMS OF THE JAILS. IS

00:43:23.367 --> 00:43:25.502
SOMETHING IF WE HAD A FULL

00:43:25.569 --> 00:43:28.005
SERVICE DRUG TREATMENT FREE

00:43:28.072 --> 00:43:31.642
AVAILABLE DRUG TREATMENT. WOULD

00:43:31.709 --> 00:43:33.344
BE TREMENDOUSLY IMPACTED IN A

00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:36.480
POSITIVE WAY. SO I TAKE THE

00:46:04.995 --> 00:46:06.296
FIFTEEN PLAN BUT I'M CONCERNED

00:46:06.363 --> 00:46:09.700
ABOUT MISAPPROPRIATION OF THE

00:46:09.766 --> 00:46:11.668
STATE OF CALIFORNIA RECEIVED.

00:46:11.735 --> 00:46:15.105
ITS SHARE OF THE SETTLEMENT SO

00:46:15.172 --> 00:46:16.273
DID ALL THE COUNTIES IN

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:19.510
CALIFORNIA BUT THE STATE-

00:46:19.576 --> 00:46:21.211
THROUGH GOVERNOR THEN GOVERNOR

00:46:21.278 --> 00:46:23.514
DAVIS TOOK THAT REVENUE STREAM

00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:25.883
SECURITIZED DEBT AND ISSUED A

00:46:25.949 --> 00:46:29.987
BOND TO. BALANCE THE BUDGET AND

00:46:30.053 --> 00:46:32.756
SO THAT MONEY DIDN'T GO TO

00:46:32.823 --> 00:46:34.057
PROGRAMS LIKE SENATOR BILL WAS

00:46:34.124 --> 00:46:35.492
REFERRING TO MOST OF IT WAS

00:46:35.559 --> 00:46:37.027
EATEN UP AND PRINCIPAL AND

00:46:37.094 --> 00:46:41.165
INTEREST- SO IT WAS. I THINK

00:46:41.231 --> 00:46:43.100
MISAPPROPRIATED IT WAS NOT USED

00:46:43.167 --> 00:46:44.434
FOR WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO START

00:46:44.501 --> 00:46:45.435
I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF

00:46:45.502 --> 00:46:46.603
PROTECTIONS YOU'RE PUTTING INTO

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:49.006
THIS EEMENT SO THAT IT DOES GO

00:46:49.072 --> 00:46:51.041
WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO GO. AND

00:46:51.108 --> 00:46:53.911
THEN- SINCE WE'RE USING A BETA

00:46:53.977 --> 00:46:56.914
PROGRAMS- WEEK WE NEED TO MAKE

00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:58.448
SURE THAT WE USE IT FOR

00:46:58.515 --> 00:47:00.484
ABATEMENT PROGRAMS AND THEN MY

00:47:00.551 --> 00:47:02.286
LAST QUESTION MIGHT BE IT IS A

00:47:02.352 --> 00:47:05.055
QUESTION FOR THE CHAIR- WE HAVE

00:47:05.122 --> 00:47:06.924
TWO SEPARATE VERY DISTINCT

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:08.759
SUBJECTS IN THIS BILL. AND I'M

00:47:08.825 --> 00:47:11.428
JUST WONDERING WHY. SHOULD THE

00:47:11.495 --> 00:47:13.230
BILL CAN BE SINGLE SUBJECT AS

00:47:13.297 --> 00:47:16.733
OPPOSED TO SETTLEMENT TEAM

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:19.336
BUILDING VERSUS FISHING GAME

00:47:19.403 --> 00:47:20.837
AND I'M JUST TRYING TO MAYBE

00:47:20.904 --> 00:47:26.043
GET AN EXPLANATION. ON THAT

00:47:26.109 --> 00:47:26.643
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK

00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:27.444
YOU MISTER GENERAL. THEY'RE

00:47:27.511 --> 00:47:28.445
MORE LIKELY FIRST THANK YOU FOR

00:47:28.512 --> 00:47:30.447
THE QUESTION HAD IT I ALMOST

00:47:30.514 --> 00:47:31.315
GET THE IMPRESSION THAT YOU'VE

00:47:31.381 --> 00:47:34.685
BEEN INSIDE OR NEGOTIATIONS

00:47:34.751 --> 00:47:35.252
BECAUSE YOU'VE SOME OF THE

00:47:35.319 --> 00:47:36.753
POINTS THAT WERE RAISED VERY

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:37.554
EARLY ON BY A LOT OF OLKS WHO

00:47:37.621 --> 00:47:39.022
WERE IS. TO SOME DEGREE

00:47:39.089 --> 00:47:40.691
DISSATISFIED WITH THE WAY THE

00:47:40.757 --> 00:47:42.593
TOBACCO SETTLEMENT ROLLED OUT

00:47:42.659 --> 00:47:44.828
AND LESSONS LEARNT A LOT OF

00:47:44.895 --> 00:47:46.230
FOLKS SAID THEY LEARNED A LOT

00:47:46.296 --> 00:47:47.898
ABOUT HOW TO DEAL WITH MASSIVE

00:47:47.965 --> 00:47:49.366
SETTLEMENTS THAT WAY THAT

00:47:49.433 --> 00:47:50.634
BROUGHT LARGE PARTS OF MANY TO

00:47:50.701 --> 00:47:53.237
EACH JURISDICTION AND HOW TO

00:47:53.303 --> 00:47:54.905
MAKE SURE IT ACTUALLY GOT USED

00:47:54.972 --> 00:47:56.440
THAT'S WHY WE STARTED FROM THE

00:47:56.506 --> 00:47:58.108
PREMISE THAT A 100% OF THE

00:47:58.175 --> 00:48:01.511
FUNDS. MUST GO INTO OPIOIDS

00:48:01.578 --> 00:48:03.480
SOME OF THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

00:48:03.547 --> 00:48:04.982
AND STATES THAT WHAT WE GOT TO

00:48:05.048 --> 00:48:05.449
HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF

00:48:05.515 --> 00:48:08.919
FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE OPIOIDS MAY

00:48:08.986 --> 00:48:12.189
HAVE CAUSED A LACK OF.

00:48:12.256 --> 00:48:13.657
EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY FOR KIDS

00:48:13.724 --> 00:48:14.458
AND WE'D LIKE TO GET THE FAT

00:48:14.524 --> 00:48:16.560
THE KIDS OR THE- PARENTS WHO

00:48:16.627 --> 00:48:17.628
DIED FROM OPIOIDS. TO KNOW THAT

00:48:17.694 --> 00:48:18.495
THEY'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE A

00:48:18.562 --> 00:48:20.230
CHANCE FOR GOOD EDUCATION FOR.

00:48:20.297 --> 00:48:22.165
OPIOID JUST BECAUSE INCREASED

00:48:22.232 --> 00:48:23.000
CRIME IN SOME OF OUR

00:48:23.066 --> 00:48:25.335
COMMUNITIES. AND A LOT OF OUR

00:48:25.402 --> 00:48:26.503
LAW ENFORCEMENT HAVE BEEN TAX

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:28.238
DEALING WITH. THAT DRUG

00:48:28.305 --> 00:48:29.773
ADDICTION AND WE SHOULD

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:31.441
COMPENSATE THOSE WHO PROTECTED

00:48:31.508 --> 00:48:33.610
PEOPLE DURING THIS CRISIS. AND

00:48:33.677 --> 00:48:35.612
SO THAT'S WHY YOU YOU SAW THE

00:48:35.679 --> 00:48:37.614
15% AND 15% SHARE FOR THE

00:48:37.681 --> 00:48:39.483
LOCALS. AND THE STATE'S THIS

00:48:39.549 --> 00:48:40.217
STILL HAS TO BE USED FOR

00:48:40.284 --> 00:48:41.618
OPIATES IT HAS TO BE RELATED TO

00:48:41.685 --> 00:48:43.353
OPIATES BUT IT HAS A LITTLE BIT

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:45.722
MORE DISCRETION. ON WHAT WE

00:48:45.789 --> 00:48:47.491
WOULD DEFINE IS STILL TACKLING

00:48:47.557 --> 00:48:48.959
THE CONSEQUENCES OF OPIOID

00:48:49.026 --> 00:48:53.930
ADDICTION. BUT 70% OF THE FUNDS.

00:48:53.997 --> 00:48:55.532
OPIOIDS AND WHO DECIDES IT'S

00:48:55.599 --> 00:48:59.136
NOT THIS. IT WILL BE THE ALL

00:48:59.202 --> 00:49:01.805
THOSE PLAYERS THE STAKEHOLDERS

00:49:01.872 --> 00:49:03.640
THIS DOES THE PLAINTIFFS LOCAL

00:49:03.707 --> 00:49:06.877
GOVERNMENTS COUNTY CITIES AND

00:49:06.943 --> 00:49:08.979
THE STATE COMING TOGETHER AND-

00:49:09.046 --> 00:49:09.846
WORKING OUT THE ARRANGEMENTS

00:49:09.913 --> 00:49:11.948
AND SO WHAT WILL BE A LUMP SUM

00:49:12.015 --> 00:49:13.483
WILL BE ANYBODY WITH WILL BE

00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:18.288
ONLY DIRECTED. TO PROGRAM

00:49:18.355 --> 00:49:18.889
SPECIFIED PROGRAM THAT WILL BE

00:49:18.955 --> 00:49:22.326
UP TO THOSE IN THE. SITTING

00:49:22.392 --> 00:49:22.926
DOWN JUST HOW. WILL ALLOCATE

00:49:22.993 --> 00:49:23.627
THAT SAID PERCENT SHARE AND

00:49:23.694 --> 00:49:25.195
ONLY THAT WAY AND IN TERMS OF

00:49:25.262 --> 00:49:27.097
ANY MISAPPROPRIATION AND AGAIN

00:49:27.164 --> 00:49:28.131
I THINK HERE'S WHERE THE

00:49:28.198 --> 00:49:29.266
CONCERN IS BY THE LOCAL

00:49:29.333 --> 00:49:32.469
GOVERNMENTS THAT THE STATE MAY.

00:49:32.536 --> 00:49:33.603
USE THAT MONEY IN WAYS THAT

00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:35.772
WERE NOT EXPECTED UP. THERE AT

00:49:35.839 --> 00:49:37.808
THE TABLE. THIS IN THIS A

00:49:37.874 --> 00:49:39.810
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IT WAS

00:49:39.876 --> 00:49:41.645
CLEAR FROM THE VERY GET GO.

00:49:41.712 --> 00:49:43.013
THEY WILL BE AT THE TABLE MOST

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:44.214
OF THOSE THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED

00:49:44.281 --> 00:49:46.550
LAWSUITS CLEARLY ARE NOT THE

00:49:46.616 --> 00:49:47.984
STATE'S THERE ONLY FIFTY STATES.

00:49:48.051 --> 00:49:50.420
IT'S MOSTLY CITIES AND COUNTIES

00:49:50.487 --> 00:49:51.421
AND QUITE HONESTLY IT'S THE

00:49:51.488 --> 00:49:52.789
COUNTIES THAT COUNT THE MOST

00:49:52.856 --> 00:49:54.324
BECAUSE IN MOST PLACES

00:49:54.391 --> 00:49:55.726
CERTAINLY CALIFORNIA. IF THE

00:49:55.792 --> 00:49:57.527
COUNTIES WILL PROVIDE. PUBLIC

00:49:57.594 --> 00:49:59.529
HEALTH. MENTAL HEALTH ALL THE

00:49:59.596 --> 00:50:01.264
HEALTHCARE SERVICES AND SO THEY

00:50:01.331 --> 00:50:03.200
WILL BE AT THE TABLE AND THIS

00:50:03.266 --> 00:50:08.238
BILL. AB SIX DOES NOT DETERMINEOR DIRECT HOW THOSE DOLLARS

00:50:08.305 --> 00:50:10.574
WILL BE ALLOCATED. THAT IS ONLY

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:12.409
THROUGH THE SETTLEMENT AND SO

00:50:12.476 --> 00:50:14.111
THIS BILL ALL IT DOES IS TRY TO

00:50:14.177 --> 00:50:15.912
GET US TO MOVE TO GET THOSE

00:50:15.979 --> 00:50:17.748
DOLLARS BECAUSE WILL FALL WAY

00:50:17.814 --> 00:50:19.349
BEHIND. IF WE CAN'T GUARANTEE

00:50:19.416 --> 00:50:21.318
THAT IN CALIFORNIA. THOSE

00:50:21.385 --> 00:50:22.753
DEFENDANTS CAN LET GO OF THOSE

00:50:22.819 --> 00:50:24.454
DOLLARS HE COMMITTED FOR THOSE

00:50:24.521 --> 00:50:26.390
PROGRAMS AND THE LESS THAT THEY

00:50:26.456 --> 00:50:27.524
CAN CLICK GOAL BECAUSE THEY

00:50:27.591 --> 00:50:29.426
DON'T HAVE. THE LIABILITY

00:50:29.493 --> 00:50:31.395
RELIEF THAT THEY NEED. THE LESS

00:50:31.461 --> 00:50:34.598
WILL BE ABLE TO DO WITH THE

00:50:34.664 --> 00:50:35.832
FUNDS THAT ARE THERE. THANK YOU

00:50:35.899 --> 00:50:37.000
TAMBIéN I'M SURE WHAT ABOUT

00:50:37.067 --> 00:50:41.138

THIS IS A NEED ONLY WHAT THE L.

00:51:24.514 --> 00:51:26.750
A. L. I DON'T THINK THIS IS A

00:51:26.817 --> 00:51:28.051
LOT OF TROUBLES ON AND WE WOULD

00:51:28.118 --> 00:51:29.753
DEFER TO THE LEGISLATURE- IN

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:32.088
TERMS OF THE CHOICE IN TERMS OF

OBVIOUSLY YOU SIR SHORT NOTICE

00:51:50.106 --> 00:51:52.742
AND GETTING INUNDATED- BUT IT'S

00:51:52.809 --> 00:51:54.744
IT WOULD SEEM THAT IF THIS.

00:51:54.811 --> 00:51:56.480
WOULD HAVE BEEN TWO BILLS THAT

00:51:56.546 --> 00:51:57.280

WOULD SAY IN RESPONSE IN TWO

00:52:12.295 --> 00:52:13.597
MORE LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT ALL

00:52:13.663 --> 00:52:15.365

THE FIRST FIVE COMMISSIONS IN

00:54:33.436 --> 00:54:35.171
THOSE WHO REALLY STARTED SEEING

00:54:35.238 --> 00:54:36.473
THE TOBACCO MONIES ACTUALLY GET

00:54:36.539 --> 00:54:37.574
DOWN TO WHERE THEY WERE

00:54:37.641 --> 00:54:41.444
ACTUALLY HELPING THE PEOPLE.

00:54:41.511 --> 00:54:42.045

POCKETS TRUST ME THERE'S

00:55:30.794 --> 00:55:32.328
ANYBODY HAS DEEP POCKETS THEY

00:56:02.759 --> 00:56:04.194

MANY CASES BECAUSE LIKE

00:56:26.182 --> 00:56:28.685
PROBABLY MANY COUNTIES IN YOUR

00:56:28.752 --> 00:56:29.319
DISTRICT THEY'RE SMALL AND THEY

00:56:29.385 --> 00:56:32.756
DON'T HAVE A LOT OF RESOURCES.

00:56:32.822 --> 00:56:33.723
IF THEY PARTICIPATE IN THE

00:56:33.790 --> 00:56:34.758
SENATE THERE GONNA GET THEIR

00:56:34.824 --> 00:56:36.459
SHARE OF WHAT WOULD COME TO

THEM EVEN IF THEY NEVER. PUT A

00:56:39.729 --> 00:56:40.196
FOOT IN THE DOOR TO FILE A

00:56:40.263 --> 00:56:44.100
LAWSUIT. BUT HERE'S WHAT THE

00:56:44.167 --> 00:56:44.734
MOSTLY THE DEFENDANT'S FEAR BUT

00:56:44.801 --> 00:56:46.936
I THINK THEY'RE RIGHT. THE

00:56:47.003 --> 00:56:48.772
MOMENT THIS IS ANNOUNCED AS A

00:56:48.838 --> 00:56:51.775

00:56:51.841 --> 00:56:54.711
ATTORNEY IS GONNA GO RENT TO

YOU HAVEN'T FILED YET. YOU KNOW

00:56:56.379 --> 00:56:57.747
IF YOU FILE YOU MIGHT BE TO

00:56:57.814 --> 00:56:59.449
EXTRACT A LITTLE BIT MORE OUT

00:56:59.516 --> 00:57:01.718
OF THESE COMPANIES. BY SAYING

00:57:01.785 --> 00:57:02.886
THAT YOU NOW I FILE YOUR OWN

00:57:02.952 --> 00:57:05.388
LAWSUIT SO NOW IT'S NOT JUST

00:57:05.455 --> 00:57:05.955
THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED LAWSUITS

00:57:06.022 --> 00:57:07.323
AGAINST IS TO DEFEND IT NOW

00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:08.925
STREET FIVE HUNDRED AND ONE AND

00:57:08.992 --> 00:57:10.860
SO THEY SHOULD UP THEIR DEAL A

00:57:10.927 --> 00:57:12.295
LITTLE BIT MORE BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:57:12.362 --> 00:57:14.030
THEY'RE IN MORTGAGE. YOU'RE

00:57:14.097 --> 00:57:15.765
PRETTY LEGALLY. AND WHAT IT

00:57:15.832 --> 00:57:20.303
DOES. AND BY THE WAY THE-PROBABLY DO THAT FOR. HANDS AND

00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:22.939
FEET. THAT BRIDGE EVEN THOUGH

00:57:23.006 --> 00:57:24.107
THEY PROBABLY NEVER TAKE THAT

00:57:24.174 --> 00:57:27.844
ALL THE WAY TO COURT. RIGHT AND-

00:57:27.911 --> 00:57:30.146
WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS AVOID THE

00:57:30.213 --> 00:57:32.015
GAMING OF THE SYSTEM WE'RE

00:57:32.081 --> 00:57:34.717
CLOSE. BUT SOMEONE'S GOING TO

00:57:34.784 --> 00:57:35.618
FEEL LIKE THEY CAN GET PRETTY

00:57:35.685 --> 00:57:37.053
SMART AND TRY TO GAME THE

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.388
SYSTEM AND SEE IF THEY CAN

00:57:38.454 --> 00:57:40.356
EXTRACT A LITTLE BIT MORE. AND

00:57:40.423 --> 00:57:42.592
WHAT THAT DOES IS IT IT WILL

00:57:42.659 --> 00:57:45.929
MAKE. IF AND IT'S A COOK THIS

00:57:45.995 --> 00:57:47.597
IS WHAT WE TOLD YOU GUYS ABOUT.

00:57:47.664 --> 00:57:50.600
CERTAINTY THIS IS. AND THAT'S

00:57:50.667 --> 00:57:53.169
WHY IN THE SENATE YOU WILL FIND

00:57:53.236 --> 00:57:55.138
LANGUAGE AS- THE MORE

00:57:55.205 --> 00:57:57.774
UNCERTAINTY THERE IS- IN TERMS

00:57:57.841 --> 00:58:00.376
OF OUR BEING SUED OR THE

00:58:00.443 --> 00:58:01.911
CAPABILITY OF OTHER GOVERNMENTS

00:58:01.978 --> 00:58:03.847
TO SUE US. THE LAST WEEK AND

00:58:03.913 --> 00:58:05.481
LET GO OF BECAUSE WE HAVE TO

00:58:05.548 --> 00:58:07.116
WATCH OUT. WE HAVE TO KEEP

00:58:07.183 --> 00:58:09.352
MONEY IN OUR POCKETS TO FIGHT

00:58:09.419 --> 00:58:12.188
OFF ANY POTENTIAL RISK. AND SO

00:58:12.255 --> 00:58:14.657
IT DEPRIVES THOSE COUNTIES IN

00:58:14.724 --> 00:58:15.992
YOUR DISTRICT ARE SAYING WE

00:58:16.059 --> 00:58:20.930
COULD'VE FOUGHT TO SEE ANY OUT.

00:58:20.997 --> 00:58:21.464
WE'RE WILLING TO TAKE OUR

00:58:21.531 --> 00:58:25.735
SHARE. OF THE SETTLEMENT AND

00:58:25.802 --> 00:58:29.005
YOUR- WILL BE DIPPED OF MONEY.

00:58:29.072 --> 00:58:30.506
BECAUSE THE DEFENDANTS WILL

00:58:30.573 --> 00:58:32.976
HAVE A RIGHT TO SAY WE CAN'T

00:58:33.042 --> 00:58:34.944
LET IT ALL GO. AND WHILE THIS

00:58:35.011 --> 00:58:36.479
DEAL WILL BE IN THE END INTHE

00:58:36.546 --> 00:58:38.081
BILLIONS OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD

00:58:38.147 --> 00:58:39.916
BE GETTING IN THE BILLIONS.

00:58:39.983 --> 00:58:41.150
THERE'S A VERY STRONG CHANCE IF

00:58:41.217 --> 00:58:42.352
WE HAVE A LOT OF THIS GAMING

00:58:42.418 --> 00:58:44.420
GOING ON THAT WE MAY FIND THAT

00:58:44.487 --> 00:58:47.891
WE ARE. PRECLUDED FROM GETTING.

00:58:47.957 --> 00:58:51.527
AND FOR MAYBE A LONG TIME. ALL

00:58:51.594 --> 00:58:52.128
OF OUR FAIR SHARE WHICH COULD

00:58:52.195 --> 00:58:54.898
BE WORK LEAVING AT LEAST

00:58:54.964 --> 00:58:55.865
MILLIONS PROBABLY HUNDREDS OF

00:58:55.932 --> 00:58:58.201
NO AND POSSIBLY BILLIONS ON THE

00:58:58.268 --> 00:59:00.336
TABLE AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE

00:59:00.403 --> 00:59:05.642
WANTS. TO THANK YOU FOR THAT

00:59:05.708 --> 00:59:06.643
ANSWER AND I THAT THERE'S

00:59:06.709 --> 00:59:07.610

THOSE BOARD MEANS. MAKING THOSE

00:59:16.753 --> 00:59:18.788
DECISIONS AS WE HAD TRIAL

00:59:18.855 --> 00:59:20.123

DESK WAS A QUARTER OF AN INCH

00:59:26.696 --> 00:59:27.130
TOO TALL. OR TOO LOW OR

00:59:27.196 --> 00:59:28.131
WHATEVER YOU NAME IT. LOOK

00:59:28.197 --> 00:59:29.899

VERY NERVOUS- AND EDUCATION BUT

00:59:54.223 --> 00:59:54.924
REASON I RAN FOR THE STATE

00:59:54.991 --> 00:59:56.025
LEGISLATORS BECAUSE I DON'T

00:59:56.092 --> 00:59:56.893
TRUST THE STATE LEGISLATURE

THEY'VE BEEN. TAKING ADVANTAGE

00:59:58.628 --> 01:00:00.930
OF MY OPINION OF COUNTIES FOR

01:00:00.997 --> 01:00:03.733
EVER- PASSING UNFUNDED MANDATES

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:05.368

DO GET THE SERVICES AND THEY'RE

01:00:12.642 --> 01:00:13.509
HAMSTRUNG AND THEY HAVE NO

01:00:13.576 --> 01:00:15.511
ABILITY. TO BE ABLE TO RAISE

01:00:15.578 --> 01:00:18.014
REVENUES- AND I AND AS I STATED

01:00:18.081 --> 01:00:21.217
EARLIER. YOU KNOW WE SAW THE

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:21.818
PRODUCT DIDN'T TAKE HIM OUT OF

01:00:21.884 --> 01:00:22.785

01:00:22.852 --> 01:00:23.953
CENTS A PACK WENT TO THE

TAKE CARE OF HEALTH ISSUES. IN

01:00:32.595 --> 01:00:33.396
OUR COUNTIES AND WE WERE ABLE

01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:35.498

THIS BILL TODAY JUST TO JERRY I

01:00:38.835 --> 01:00:39.769
THINK WE NEED A LITTLE MORE

01:00:39.836 --> 01:00:41.738
TIME A LOT MORE DETAIL. NOTHING

01:00:41.804 --> 01:00:44.107
AGAINST THE THAT YOUR OFFICE OR

01:00:44.173 --> 01:00:45.341
WHAT YOU'RE DOING THERE BUT I

01:00:45.408 --> 01:00:46.442
THINK IT IF WE DO A LOT MORE

01:00:46.509 --> 01:00:51.414
WORK. APPRECIATE YOUR- ANSWERS

THE AG ARE PRE IS TO OF THE

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:06.596
GAMING THAT COULD OCCUR HOWEVER

01:01:06.662 --> 01:01:09.599
I THINK THE- WHEN WE THINK

01:01:09.665 --> 01:01:13.903
ABOUT. THE DAMAGE THAT THOSE

01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:16.339
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES WHO

01:01:16.406 --> 01:01:19.008
KNOWINGLY ANDREA TOBACCO AND

01:01:19.075 --> 01:01:21.577
ALLERGIES ARE QUITE ACCURATE TO

01:01:21.644 --> 01:01:24.981
MAKE YOUR KNOWINGLY. DEVELOPED

01:01:25.048 --> 01:01:28.618
A PRODUCT. THAT THE NEWS WAS

01:01:28.684 --> 01:01:31.320
HIGHLY ADDICTIVE AND

01:01:31.387 --> 01:01:33.289
PURPOSEFULLY PUSHED IT AND

01:01:33.356 --> 01:01:35.925
PUSHED THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY WE

01:01:35.992 --> 01:01:39.062
DID NOT REVEAL THE INFORMATION

01:01:39.128 --> 01:01:40.930
ABOUT HOW HOW MUCH THEY KNEW

01:01:40.997 --> 01:01:42.698
ABOUT ITS ADDICTION. OUR

01:01:42.765 --> 01:01:45.301
CAPABILITIES BUT THEN PUSH THE

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:48.304
MEDICAL COMMUNITY TO UTILIZE

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:51.307
OVERSUBSCRIBED AND TO UTILIZE

01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:53.910
IT FOR SO MANY MORE. TYPES OF

01:01:53.976 --> 01:01:56.345
TREATMENTS THEN REALLY WOULD

01:01:56.412 --> 01:01:59.248
EVER BE JUSTIFIED AND WHEN WE

01:01:59.315 --> 01:02:01.017
THINK ABOUT THE DAMAGE TO OUR

01:02:01.084 --> 01:02:02.885
COMMUNITIES TO FAMILIES TO

01:02:02.952 --> 01:02:04.921
INDIVIDUALS TO OUR COUNTIES TO

01:02:04.987 --> 01:02:07.323
OUR CITIES. IT IS SO SEVERE

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:11.627
THAT I HESITATE TO BE IN A

01:02:11.694 --> 01:02:13.563
SITUATION WHERE WE WOULD NOW

01:02:13.629 --> 01:02:16.566
PREVENT ANY FUTURE LAWSUITS

01:02:16.632 --> 01:02:17.633
BECAUSE I THINK THERE COULD BE

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:19.102
MORE THE COULD BE UNCOVERED

01:02:19.168 --> 01:02:21.904
FIRST. SO I'M A LITTLE

01:02:21.971 --> 01:02:24.006
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT NOW BUT I

01:02:24.073 --> 01:02:26.209
THINK THE MOST SERIOUS CONCERN

01:02:26.275 --> 01:02:28.277
IS THAT. WE ARE RECEIVING

01:02:28.344 --> 01:02:30.746
COMMUNICATIONS FROM OUR CITIES

01:02:30.813 --> 01:02:32.315
AND COUNTIES THAT HAVE BEEN.

01:02:32.381 --> 01:02:34.016
THAT HAVE BEEN PARTY'S THESE

01:02:34.083 --> 01:02:35.885
LAWSUITS WHO INDICATED THAT

01:02:35.952 --> 01:02:37.987
THEY HAVE REACHED OUT TO THE

01:02:38.054 --> 01:02:40.623
AG'S OFFICE THAT JUST AS THE AG

01:02:40.690 --> 01:02:43.793
DESCRIBED THIS TYPE OF. GLOBAL

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:46.229
SETTLEMENT IS NOT UNCOMMON AND

01:02:46.295 --> 01:02:48.164
SO WHAT I'M GETTING FROM THE

01:02:48.231 --> 01:02:49.499
CITIES AND THE COUNTIES IS NOT

01:02:49.565 --> 01:02:51.868
SO MUCH THAT THEY ARE OPPOSED

01:02:51.934 --> 01:02:54.871
TO THIS. POTENTIAL CONCEPT BUT

01:02:54.937 --> 01:02:56.239
RATHER THE ONCE MORE THE

01:02:56.305 --> 01:02:58.508
DETAILS WORKED OUT AND OUT WHEN

01:02:58.574 --> 01:03:01.677
THEY LOOK AT WHAT THE DETAILS

01:03:01.744 --> 01:03:03.946
SO FAR THE OTHER STATES. THE

01:03:04.013 --> 01:03:05.548
LEGISLATION THAT OTHER STATES

01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:07.183
HAVE DONE THAT WOULD

01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:09.051
INCORPORATE CITIES AND COUNTIES

01:03:09.118 --> 01:03:11.020
THERE'S MORE OF THE DETAIL HAS

01:03:11.087 --> 01:03:13.122
BEEN SPELLED OUT AND THAT THEY

01:03:13.189 --> 01:03:14.991
ARE VERY CONCERNED THAT WITHOUT

01:03:15.057 --> 01:03:19.896
THAT SPELLED OUT DETAIL. WE ARE

01:03:19.962 --> 01:03:20.463
REALLY TOO MUCH WASHING YOUR

01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:24.300
HANDS OF. OF HOW- HOW THESE

01:03:24.367 --> 01:03:27.036
FUNDS MIGHT BE DISPERSED AND-

01:03:27.103 --> 01:03:30.239
HI I THINK THE AG IF YOU WANT

01:03:30.306 --> 01:03:31.874
TO RESPOND TO THAT I KNOW YOU

01:03:31.941 --> 01:03:33.242
TO SORT OF ADDRESS THIS BUT

01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:34.310
THAT IS THE CLEAR

01:03:34.377 --> 01:03:38.714
COMMUNICATION. THAT WE ARE

01:03:38.781 --> 01:03:39.282
GETTING FROM OUR CITIES AND

01:03:39.348 --> 01:03:40.783
COUNTIES. AND MANAGER IF I

01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:43.085
COULD RESPOND YES PLEASE.

01:03:43.152 --> 01:03:45.221
SERVICE CENTER SKINNER OF AND

01:03:45.288 --> 01:03:47.823
GOOD POINT AND- HERE'S WHAT

01:03:47.890 --> 01:03:49.559
CONFUSES ME ABOUT WHAT SOME OF

01:03:49.625 --> 01:03:52.395
THE- THE ATTORNEYS FOR THESE-

01:03:52.461 --> 01:03:54.564
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE SAYING-

01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:58.634
THIS BILL IN NO WAY CAN DRIVE

01:03:58.701 --> 01:04:00.703
ANY PART OF THE SETTLEMENT

01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:05.174
DISCUSSION. THE REALITY IS THAT

01:04:05.241 --> 01:04:08.010
THIS BILL SIMPLY SAYS. TWO

01:04:08.077 --> 01:04:11.013
THINGS. FIRST IT SAYS. IF YOU

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:12.648
HAVEN'T ALREADY FILED A CLAIM

01:04:12.715 --> 01:04:14.784
AGAINST THESE DEFENDANTS. THEN

01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:15.851
YOU CAN'T RUSH TO THE

01:04:15.918 --> 01:04:18.554
COURTHOUSE TO TRY TO DO IT NOW

01:04:18.621 --> 01:04:20.690
WHICH WOULD ESSENTIALLY MAKE

01:04:20.756 --> 01:04:22.725
THE DEFENDANTS BACK OFF OF

01:04:22.792 --> 01:04:24.260
PROVIDING THE FULL RESOURCES IN

01:04:24.327 --> 01:04:27.396
THE SECOND. AND SO WE'RE TRYING

01:04:27.463 --> 01:04:30.633
TO SAY. THE GAME HAS CONCLUDED

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:32.868
LET'S TALLY UP THE SCORE SO WE

01:04:32.935 --> 01:04:34.937
CAN MOVE AND DETERMINE HOW TO

01:04:35.004 --> 01:04:36.872
DISTRIBUTE THE RESOURCES TO

01:04:36.939 --> 01:04:38.975
MAKE IT TO DEAL WITH THE HARM

01:04:39.041 --> 01:04:42.278
CAUSED BY THE OPIOID CRISIS.

01:04:42.345 --> 01:04:45.081
IT'S AND IT'S VERY CLEAR MOST

01:04:45.147 --> 01:04:45.648
OF THE PEOPLE YOU'RE HEARING

01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:47.216
FROM. ARE THE FOLKS WHO HAVEN'T

01:04:47.283 --> 01:04:49.318

01:04:53.589 --> 01:04:57.560
TRY TO BE DIPLOMATIC YOU'RE NOT

01:04:57.627 --> 01:04:58.060
HEARING SO MUCH FROM THE

01:04:58.127 --> 01:04:58.761
SUPERVISORS FROM THEIR

01:04:58.828 --> 01:05:01.163
ATTORNEYS. AND BY THE WAY. GO

01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:03.232
DEEPER YOU'RE NOT REALLY

01:05:03.299 --> 01:05:03.733

01:05:05.368 --> 01:05:07.570
PRIVATE ATTORNEYS THAT THESE

01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:11.274
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE HIGHER.

01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:12.541
THE FOLLOWING THIS BUILT IN A

01:05:12.608 --> 01:05:15.378
DAY. WILL END UP PROVIDING FOR

01:05:15.444 --> 01:05:20.383
ATTORNEYS FEES. SUBSTANTIALLY

01:05:20.449 --> 01:05:23.953

UNITED I'M I WILL TELL YOU I AM

ARGUMENTS THAT I'M HEARING

01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:34.330
BECAUSE- THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:05:34.397 --> 01:05:36.832
HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE THIS

01:05:36.899 --> 01:05:40.336
BILL CANNOT CLOSE THAT DOOR.

01:05:40.403 --> 01:05:43.406
THIS BILL SIMPLY SAYS NO MORE

01:05:43.472 --> 01:05:45.374
NEW LAWSUITS AGAINST THESE

01:05:45.441 --> 01:05:47.376
DEFENDANTS SINCE YOU KNEW THIS

01:05:47.443 --> 01:05:48.678
THIS WORK ON THE SETTLEMENT HAS

01:05:48.744 --> 01:05:49.979
BEEN UNDER WAY FOR MORE THAN

01:05:50.046 --> 01:05:52.782
TWO YEARS. AND SO TO RUSH TO

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:55.851
CLAIM WHEN WE GOT THE

SETTLEMENT IN PLACE IS SIMPLY

01:05:58.988 --> 01:06:02.892
TO REALLY. GET IN THE WAY OF

FRUSTRATION IS BECAUSE THAT'S

01:07:33.749 --> 01:07:34.383
WHY IT'S TAKEN SO LONG TO GET

01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:36.218
TO THIS POINT. BECAUSE WE'VE

01:07:36.285 --> 01:07:37.987

ABOUT NEEDING TO FILE A CLAIM.

01:07:49.398 --> 01:07:50.599

01:07:52.134 --> 01:07:53.602

01:07:56.071 --> 01:07:58.874

01:08:17.827 --> 01:08:19.295
MINUTE WE DID NOT EXPECT THE

01:08:19.361 --> 01:08:21.697
DEFENDANT TO GIVE US A SOLID

01:08:21.764 --> 01:08:25.601
RESPONSE TO WORK TO OUR DEMAND.

01:08:25.668 --> 01:08:27.136
AND BECAUSE OF THAT WE HAVE A

01:08:27.203 --> 01:08:28.971
CHANCE TO BRING THIS YEAR THE

01:08:29.038 --> 01:08:31.807
TIPPING POINT TO A GOOD END.

01:08:31.874 --> 01:08:33.509
BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET THIS

01:08:33.576 --> 01:08:38.247
BE ABUSED BY BY INDIVIDUALS WHO

01:08:38.314 --> 01:08:38.881
JUST WANT TO. REALLY GET IN THE

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:42.451
SYSTEM. IF I CAN JUST FOLLOW UP

01:08:42.518 --> 01:08:44.520
ABSOLUTELY SAID THANK YOU

01:08:44.587 --> 01:08:47.122
CHAIR. SO I AM HEARING FROM

01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:49.325
MAYORS I AM NOT ONLY HEARING

01:08:49.391 --> 01:08:51.861
FROM CITY ATTORNEYS I'M ALSO

01:08:51.927 --> 01:08:53.529
HEARING FROM MEMBERS OF PORTS

01:08:53.596 --> 01:08:55.731
OF SOUPS. NOW YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY

01:08:55.798 --> 01:08:57.466
RIGHT THEY COULD HAVE USED AN

01:08:57.533 --> 01:09:00.069
EXTERNAL COUNSEL. BUT THE ONES

01:09:00.135 --> 01:09:01.871
I AM HEARING FROM MARK ACTUALLY

01:09:01.937 --> 01:09:04.006
FILED LAWSUITS SO THEY'RE NOT

01:09:04.073 --> 01:09:05.674
PARTY THEY'RE NOT ENTITIES THAT

01:09:05.741 --> 01:09:08.477
DID NOT FILE A LAWSUIT. SO THAT

01:09:08.544 --> 01:09:10.713
THEIR OBJECTION IS NOT THAT DAY

01:09:10.779 --> 01:09:12.515
WOULD. LATER BE PRECLUDED

01:09:12.581 --> 01:09:13.816
THOUGH I THINK THERE IS A

01:09:13.883 --> 01:09:16.018
LEGITIMATE ISSUE AROUND OUT BUT

01:09:16.085 --> 01:09:19.388
LET IT GO LET THAT DECIDE I

01:09:19.455 --> 01:09:22.091
THINK THERE'S- A- IF THE BILL

01:09:22.157 --> 01:09:23.659
IS AS SIMPLE AND

01:09:23.726 --> 01:09:27.796
STRAIGHTFORWARD THEN IT'S HARD

01:09:27.863 --> 01:09:28.531
FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND WHY THOSE

01:09:28.597 --> 01:09:31.133
CITIES AND COUNTIES CAN'T READ

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:33.669
IT IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOU ARE

01:09:33.736 --> 01:09:37.306
DESCRIBING AND I THINK. THAT

01:09:37.373 --> 01:09:40.976
ALONE THERE IS EITHER A SERIOUS

01:09:41.043 --> 01:09:43.345
LACK OF COMMUNICATION OR DAY

01:09:43.412 --> 01:09:45.915
THEIR READ IS VERY DIFFERENT

01:09:45.981 --> 01:09:50.753
THAN THE ARE AT DOJ'S READ- AND

01:09:50.819 --> 01:09:52.254
IT'S HARD FOR US TO DISCERN

01:09:52.321 --> 01:09:54.290
RIGHT NOW WHICH WHICH IS THE

01:09:54.356 --> 01:09:57.493
CASE. I'M SURE IF I COULD JUST

01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:00.062
ADD TO THE CENTERS QUESTION

01:10:00.129 --> 01:10:00.629

THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL. IN A

01:10:19.648 --> 01:10:21.450

THEY CAN STRUGGLE ALL THE WAY.

01:11:24.313 --> 01:11:26.048
AB SIX SIMPLY SAYS MOVING

01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:29.351
FORWARD SO ALL THOSE FOLKS

01:11:29.418 --> 01:11:29.885
WHO'VE ALREADY FILED THEIR

01:11:29.952 --> 01:11:31.587

01:11:38.093 --> 01:11:40.529
NO AMBIGUITY HERE. I THAT'S WHY

01:11:40.596 --> 01:11:41.930

LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE CONCERNED

01:11:43.232 --> 01:11:46.268

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WE WERE

01:12:56.071 --> 01:12:57.906

THEY'RE GETTING. ALMOST TWO

01:13:24.199 --> 01:13:28.270
PERCENTAGE POINTS LAST. THAT'S

01:13:28.337 --> 01:13:28.837
A DEAL THAT THEIR ATTORNEYS

01:13:28.904 --> 01:13:30.639
NEGOTIATED FOR THEM. AND SO I

01:13:30.706 --> 01:13:35.210

THIS BILL NOT BECAUSE IT'S SO-

01:13:40.048 --> 01:13:41.483
DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND IT'S

01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:43.085
HARD NOT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

01:13:43.152 --> 01:13:44.319

01:13:44.386 --> 01:13:46.255
PARAGRAPHS AND THE WORDS ARE

01:13:46.321 --> 01:13:48.357

OF THE ENTIRE SPRING PROCESS

01:49:39.873 --> 01:49:40.473
THAT WE NORMALLY GO THROUGH

ABILITY TO DISTANCE LEARNERS

JUST NOT AVAILABLE BECAUSE WE

PLENTY OF SPACE IN OUR SCHOOLS

02:04:18.951 --> 02:04:19.785

THERE BUT THE ONE THING THAT

02:04:25.424 --> 02:04:27.860
SETS GUINNESS STIFLE FOR SCHOOL

02:04:27.927 --> 02:04:30.296
BOARDS IS THAT OF THE LIABILITY

02:04:30.362 --> 02:04:31.163
AND SO THERE WAS SOME

02:04:31.230 --> 02:04:32.731
LEGISLATIONPREVIOUSLY THAT WAS

02:04:32.798 --> 02:04:34.600

THERE'S ANYTHING IN THIS. IN

02:04:37.436 --> 02:04:39.138
THIS TRAILER BILL WOULD ADDRESS

02:04:39.205 --> 02:04:42.208
THAT- A LIABILITY ISSUE THAT IS

02:04:42.274 --> 02:04:44.476
LOOMING AND HOLDING OUR SCHOOL

02:04:44.543 --> 02:04:47.146

02:04:47.213 --> 02:04:48.380
GUESS STATE THEY'RE FEARFUL

02:04:48.447 --> 02:04:49.381
THAT THEY'RE GONNA GET SUED IF

02:04:49.448 --> 02:04:51.750

02:04:51.817 --> 02:04:53.185
CHOPPED CHILD BRINGS COBIT IN-

02:04:53.252 --> 02:04:54.653
THAT'S VERY UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE

02:04:54.720 --> 02:04:55.387
WE CAN ACTUALLY BRING THESE

02:04:55.454 --> 02:04:56.889
KIDS TO OUR SCHOOLS AND- THE

02:04:56.956 --> 02:04:58.090
TEACHER WHERE THEY CAN'T GET

02:04:58.157 --> 02:04:59.792
UP. THE SERVICE IS ANY OTHER

02:04:59.859 --> 02:05:03.596
WAY. BECAUSE THERE'S NO

02:05:03.662 --> 02:05:04.163
INFRASTRUCTURE AVAILABLE FOR

02:05:04.230 --> 02:05:08.868

AS WELL- I DON'T BELIEVE THE

02:05:12.705 --> 02:05:15.574
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS- A

02:05:15.641 --> 02:05:17.209
POSITION ON THE BILL THAT YOUR

02:05:17.276 --> 02:05:20.212

02:05:20.279 --> 02:05:24.383
HELP. ON EDUCATION COMMITTEE-

02:05:24.450 --> 02:05:25.017
BUT- I BUT I CAN TELL YOU WITH

02:05:25.084 --> 02:05:27.553
THAT. AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE

02:05:27.620 --> 02:05:28.687
DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY LANGUAGE

02:05:28.754 --> 02:05:31.156
THAT WOULD LIMIT THE LIABILITY-

02:05:31.223 --> 02:05:34.460
FOR EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES.

02:05:34.526 --> 02:05:36.395

02:05:52.912 --> 02:05:54.380

AT THE INTERSECTION. OF MAJOR

02:13:50.922 --> 02:13:52.524

STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN THE

02:14:58.990 --> 02:15:00.826
BUDGET. BECAUSE THE TRAILER

PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET ITSELF

02:15:06.198 --> 02:15:07.632

02:15:07.699 --> 02:15:11.303

02:15:11.369 --> 02:15:15.807

ARE THOUSANDS OF USERS THAT ARE

02:23:00.471 --> 02:23:02.273
ACTUALLY ELIGIBLE TO GO TO DJJ

02:23:02.340 --> 02:23:04.575
TODAY. I DON'T END UP COMING TO

02:23:04.642 --> 02:23:06.878
DJJ- IN THE FORMULA WEIGHTS

02:23:06.945 --> 02:23:09.514
THAT CATEGORY THE HIGHEST IN

02:23:09.580 --> 02:23:11.749
SOME WAY TO REFLECT THAT AND WE

02:23:11.816 --> 02:23:13.451
WANT TO PROVIDE COUNTY'S MONEY

02:23:13.518 --> 02:23:14.619
TO DEAL WITH THAT. ENTIRE

02:23:14.686 --> 02:23:17.689
POPULATION- AND SO LOOKING

02:23:17.755 --> 02:23:19.457
FORWARD FOR COUNTIES THAT ARE

02:23:19.524 --> 02:23:21.993
HIGHER OR HIGHER YOU LATER

02:23:22.060 --> 02:23:23.194
SERVERS AND DJJ ON THAT

02:23:23.261 --> 02:23:25.196
POPULATION. I MEAN THEY NEED TO

02:23:25.263 --> 02:23:26.297
DO SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY WITH

02:23:26.364 --> 02:23:27.465
THE FOLKS MAYBE THEY'RE

02:23:27.532 --> 02:23:29.834
INCARCERATING LOCALLY- TO BE

02:23:29.901 --> 02:23:31.602
ABLE TO TAKE ON THE ENTIRE NEW.

02:23:31.669 --> 02:23:34.272
NEED YEAR- BUT IT'S SORT OF A

02:23:34.339 --> 02:23:36.240
AND IT'S ALSO A LOOKING FORWARD

02:23:36.307 --> 02:23:37.742
FORMULA THAT REALLY BAD IN SOME

02:23:37.809 --> 02:23:39.544
WAYS. AND STATES THAT WHAT IT

02:23:39.610 --> 02:23:41.746
WOULD HAVE SINCE 200-018-2000

02:23:41.813 --> 02:23:42.780
NINETEEN IS A REFLECTIVE OF

02:23:42.847 --> 02:23:43.715
WHAT WILL HAPPEN MOVING

02:23:43.781 --> 02:23:46.050
FORWARD. MY WHAT ARE AND THAT

02:23:46.117 --> 02:23:48.219
BIGGER POPULATION OF JUDICATA

02:23:48.286 --> 02:23:50.088
YOUTH IN THOSE CRIME CATEGORIES

02:23:50.154 --> 02:23:51.422
I MENTIONED. ARE ACTUALLY A

02:23:51.489 --> 02:23:52.924
MORE HOLISTIC LOOK AT THE

02:23:52.991 --> 02:23:54.125
POPULATION THAT ACTUALLY IS

02:23:54.192 --> 02:23:56.227
BEING REALIGNED. I'M NOT JUST

02:23:56.294 --> 02:23:57.729
THE ONES THAT WERE ACTUALLY

02:23:57.795 --> 02:23:59.530
SENT TO DJJ. I THINK THE

02:23:59.597 --> 02:24:00.798
FRUSTRATION THAT- AND I AGAIN

02:24:00.865 --> 02:24:02.834
I'LL SPEAK MORE ON. RURAL

02:24:02.900 --> 02:24:05.470
COUNTIES RURAL COUNTIES RELY ON

02:24:05.536 --> 02:24:07.905
DJJ MORE THAN URBAN COUNTIES OR

02:24:07.972 --> 02:24:09.107
EVEN SUBURBAN COUNTIES BECAUSE

02:24:09.173 --> 02:24:10.541
THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL

02:24:10.608 --> 02:24:12.844
RESOURCES WITHIN THE COUNTY. SO

02:24:12.910 --> 02:24:13.711
THEN WHAT WE'RE GOING TO START

02:24:13.778 --> 02:24:14.545
DOING IS NOW WE'RE GONNA START

02:24:14.612 --> 02:24:23.154
LEARNING. ADDITIONAL. AND I GET

02:24:23.221 --> 02:24:24.188
IT IN ABSOLUTELY AGREE. WITH Y.

02:24:24.255 --> 02:24:24.789
WE'RE GOING DOWN THIS ROAD IT

02:24:24.856 --> 02:24:25.656
IS ABSOLUTELY. AFTER FUTURE OF

02:24:25.723 --> 02:24:26.791
THE- KIDS. IN IT THIS TIME

02:24:26.858 --> 02:24:27.892

TO DO SO. AND I JUST I HAVE

02:24:39.237 --> 02:24:40.938
SOMECONCERNS ABOUT THIS

SOME OF THAT MAY COME FROM

02:30:38.696 --> 02:30:40.598

THAT MANNER SO- WHICH IS LESS

02:31:30.281 --> 02:31:32.450

02:32:58.135 --> 02:32:59.937
IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY ZERO IF WE

02:33:00.004 --> 02:33:02.806
JUST USE ONLY DJJ AS A FACTOR.

02:33:02.873 --> 02:33:05.009
AND IT WOULD BE ABOUT TWO POINT

02:33:05.075 --> 02:33:06.810
THREE MILLION DOLLARS IF WE

02:33:06.877 --> 02:33:09.146
USE- THE FACTORS AS LAID OUT IN

02:33:09.213 --> 02:33:11.115
THE TRAILER BILL. OKAY AND I

02:33:11.181 --> 02:33:17.054
UNDERSTAND I UNDERSTAND THE.

02:33:17.121 --> 02:33:17.621
INCENTIVE PROGRAM IS WORKING

02:33:17.688 --> 02:33:18.722
HERE. SO MY NEXT QUESTION. IS

02:33:18.789 --> 02:33:20.991
THERE A PLAN TO CREATE A PATH

02:33:21.058 --> 02:33:23.193
TO HELP THOSE COUNTIES WHO.

02:33:23.260 --> 02:33:25.462
NEED HELP TO DEVELOP. MORE

02:33:25.529 --> 02:33:27.131
MATURE AND ROBUST LOCAL

02:33:27.197 --> 02:33:29.333
PROGRAMS TO DEAL WITH THESE

02:33:29.400 --> 02:33:35.172
SEVEN SEVEN B. IS THERE SOME

02:33:35.239 --> 02:33:36.907
BREADCRUMB APPROACH TO

02:33:36.974 --> 02:33:38.008
INCENTIVIZE THE COUNTIES AND

02:33:38.075 --> 02:33:41.078
HELP THEM. EXPAND THE LOCAL

02:33:41.145 --> 02:33:42.846
PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

02:33:42.913 --> 02:33:44.615
GET THEM TO EXPAND TO DEAL WITH

02:33:44.682 --> 02:33:48.686
JUVENILES. YEAH I THINK THERE'S

02:33:48.752 --> 02:33:50.521
AND FOR THOSE BUT IT WILL NOT

02:33:50.588 --> 02:33:52.389
ENTITLED TO MONEY SO MONEY A

02:33:52.456 --> 02:33:54.858
MONETARY PLAN RIGHT IT'S SO

02:33:54.925 --> 02:33:56.894
EASY THE TRAILER BILL

02:33:56.961 --> 02:33:58.228
APPROPRIATES NINE POINT SIX

02:33:58.295 --> 02:34:00.464
MILLION DOLLARS TO ASSIST

02:34:00.531 --> 02:34:01.832
COUNTIES MUST START OF FUNDS SO

02:34:01.899 --> 02:34:03.667
THAT COULD BE FACILITY UPGRADES

02:34:03.734 --> 02:34:05.469
I CAN BE PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT.

02:34:05.536 --> 02:34:06.937
AND I THINK THAT'S ONE CRITICAL

02:34:07.004 --> 02:34:08.706
AREA WHERE SOME OF THESE

02:34:08.772 --> 02:34:10.474
COUNTIES THAT DON'T HAVE THOSE

02:34:10.541 --> 02:34:14.144
PROGRAMS DEVELOPS AND- DO THAT-

02:34:14.211 --> 02:34:16.180
AND THEN SECONDARILY TO I THINK

02:34:16.246 --> 02:34:17.881
I WOULD POINT OUT THAT THIS IS

02:34:17.948 --> 02:34:19.917
NOT WHERE THE STATE WILL START

02:34:19.984 --> 02:34:23.754
SENDING THEIR U. AS A MEDIA

02:34:23.821 --> 02:34:25.089
LEAST. YOU'D BETTER IN THE IN

02:34:25.155 --> 02:34:26.390
THE COUNTY MEANS JULY ONE IT

02:34:26.457 --> 02:34:28.659
WILL BE. YEAH WILL NO LONGER BE

02:34:28.726 --> 02:34:30.294
A SENTENCING OPTION EXCEPT FOR

02:34:30.361 --> 02:34:32.396
CERTAIN YOU. I'M IMMEDIATELY IN

02:34:32.463 --> 02:34:34.365
JULY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND

02:34:34.431 --> 02:34:35.499
THEREFORE THERE THE SENATE A

02:34:35.566 --> 02:34:37.768
SLOW INCREASE TO A COUNTY IT

02:34:37.835 --> 02:34:38.636
HAD TO TAKE OVER THIS

02:34:38.702 --> 02:34:40.504
POPULATIONS OVER THE NEXT TEN

02:34:40.571 --> 02:34:42.072
MONTHS WITH THAT NINE POINT SIX

02:34:42.139 --> 02:34:43.907
MILLION DOLLARS. AND THEN

02:34:43.974 --> 02:34:45.242
HAVING THE TIME TO SORT OF PLAN

02:34:45.309 --> 02:34:48.012
FOR THAT- THAT. THE PLANE THE

02:34:48.078 --> 02:34:49.380
HOPE IS THAT THOSE COUNTIES

02:34:49.446 --> 02:34:50.714
WILL BE ABLE TO SORT OF. EITHER

02:34:50.781 --> 02:34:52.116
BUILD UP THE CAPACITY

02:34:52.182 --> 02:34:53.550
THEMSELVES OR SORT OF

02:34:53.617 --> 02:34:55.219
REGIONALLY FIGURE OUT WHICH

02:34:55.285 --> 02:34:57.021
COMPANIES CAN DO Y. AND SORT OF

02:34:57.087 --> 02:34:58.255
LOOK AT YOU KNOW MAYBE ONE

02:34:58.322 --> 02:34:59.123
COUNTY DOES MENTAL HEALTH

02:34:59.189 --> 02:35:00.424
TREATMENT ONE TO SEX OFFENDER

02:35:00.491 --> 02:35:01.792
TREATMENT. AND SORT OF BUILD

02:35:01.859 --> 02:35:04.495
THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND TO

02:35:04.561 --> 02:35:05.496
PROVIDE THE SERVICES NEEDED FOR

02:35:05.562 --> 02:35:06.697
THE USED TO HAVE IF IT IF IT

02:35:06.764 --> 02:35:08.532
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR OR

02:35:08.599 --> 02:35:12.936
COUNTY TO HAVE THAT DEDICATED.

02:35:13.003 --> 02:35:14.938
PROGRAM SO. I'M I'M A LITTLE

02:35:15.005 --> 02:35:15.639
BIT HANDICAP BECAUSE I DON'T

02:35:15.706 --> 02:35:16.974
KNOW THE LANDSCAPE WHICH BUT

02:35:17.041 --> 02:35:18.142
YOU KNOW THE LANDSCAPE OF THE

02:35:18.208 --> 02:35:19.543
COUNTIES THAT ARE IMPACTED IN

LANDSCAPE WHICH YOU KNOW. DO

02:35:24.281 --> 02:35:25.449
YOU THINK THE NINE POINT

02:35:25.516 --> 02:35:27.451
WHATEVER IT WAS MILLION. IS

02:35:27.518 --> 02:35:29.086
SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW THOSE

02:35:29.153 --> 02:35:31.021
COUNTIES THAT ARE IMPACTED TO.

02:35:31.088 --> 02:35:32.523
BUILD UP THE LOCAL PROGRAMS

02:35:32.589 --> 02:35:35.592
NECESSARY. TO ATTRACT THE

02:35:35.659 --> 02:35:37.761
ADDITIONAL FUNDING NECESSARY.

02:35:50.474 --> 02:35:52.376
FULL ANSWER ON WHETHER IN THE

02:35:52.443 --> 02:35:54.311
SUFFICIENCY ABOUT FINDING WILL

02:35:54.378 --> 02:35:55.813
BE ABLE TO ALLOW EVERY COUNTY

02:35:55.879 --> 02:35:58.315

HAVE INCLUDED THAT AS THE START

02:36:04.755 --> 02:36:08.292
UP SIGNS- AND I'M SURE. BOOKS

02:36:08.358 --> 02:36:10.461
WOULD ALWAYS LIKE MORE BUT-

02:36:10.527 --> 02:36:13.097
THAT WASN'T AN AREA- BIG

02:36:13.163 --> 02:36:14.665
DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE PARTIES

02:36:14.732 --> 02:36:18.669

02:36:27.010 --> 02:36:28.779
THIS SLOWLY AS AND THEY'RE NOT

02:36:28.846 --> 02:36:31.248
GOING TO IMMEDIATELY HAVE A

02:36:31.315 --> 02:36:32.015
HUNDRED YEARS THAT THEY DIDN'T

02:36:32.082 --> 02:36:33.951
OTHERWISE HAVE ON JULY WIND

02:36:34.017 --> 02:36:34.952
IT'LL BE SORT OF THE SLOW

02:36:35.018 --> 02:36:36.854
GROWTH INTO THAT PROGRAM OVER

02:36:36.920 --> 02:36:38.388
TIME. WHAT I HOPE YOU'LL

02:36:38.455 --> 02:36:40.491
CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THIS AS WE

02:36:40.557 --> 02:36:41.692

AND THANK YOU FOR- THE QUESTION

02:36:58.108 --> 02:37:01.745
SO FAR. I GUESS THE ISSUE FOR

02:37:01.812 --> 02:37:05.816
ME IS THAT. MY UNDERSTANDING IS

02:37:05.883 --> 02:37:07.818
THAT THIS IS KIND OF A

02:37:07.885 --> 02:37:12.055
COMPROMISE. PROPOSAL THAT THAT

02:37:12.122 --> 02:37:13.791
TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF FROM WHAT

02:37:13.857 --> 02:37:16.493
THE GOVERNOR HAD PROPOSED- IN

02:37:16.560 --> 02:37:18.762
HIS. EITHER IN HIS JANUARY

02:37:18.829 --> 02:37:21.732
BUDGET OR MAY REVISED AND- SOME

02:37:21.799 --> 02:37:23.600
INTEREST THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:37:23.667 --> 02:37:27.304
HADN'T I GUESS I GUESS IT AND

02:37:27.371 --> 02:37:28.772
YOU SAID YOU INDICATED THAT.

02:37:28.839 --> 02:37:31.375
THE COUNTIES WERE AT THE TABLE.

02:37:31.441 --> 02:37:34.111
AND ARE AWARE OF THIS PROPOSAL

02:37:34.178 --> 02:37:36.446
AND WE'RE NEGOTIATING AND I MY

02:37:36.513 --> 02:37:38.849
PHONE'S BEEN BLOWING UP TODAY

02:37:38.916 --> 02:37:40.951
THEN MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE WE'RE

02:37:41.018 --> 02:37:43.520
WE'RE TRYING TO DO. BUDGET AT

02:37:43.587 --> 02:37:44.054
THE SAME TIME THAT WE'RE

02:37:44.121 --> 02:37:45.889
FINISHING UP BILLS AND SO

02:37:45.956 --> 02:37:47.457
EVERYBODY THINKS EVERYTHING'S

02:37:47.524 --> 02:37:49.193
BEEN PUT TOGETHER AT THE LAST

02:37:49.259 --> 02:37:49.993
MINUTE OR MAYBE IT HAS BEEN

02:37:50.060 --> 02:37:52.296
BUT- THE COUNTIES ARE TELLING

02:37:52.362 --> 02:37:54.264
ME THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THEY

02:37:54.331 --> 02:37:55.399
HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE THAT

02:37:55.465 --> 02:37:57.634
THEY'RE NOT PREPARED. TO BE

02:37:57.701 --> 02:38:00.237
ABLE TO IMPLEMENT. THIS AS

02:38:00.304 --> 02:38:04.174
QUICKLY AS BOB IS AS IT IS IN

02:38:04.241 --> 02:38:06.143
THE BUDGET AND THAT THAT THEY

02:38:06.210 --> 02:38:08.245
JUST DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO

02:38:08.312 --> 02:38:08.846
DO THIS RIGHT NOW AND IT HAS

02:38:08.912 --> 02:38:10.714
NOT BEEN PART. THAT THEY

02:38:10.781 --> 02:38:11.715
HAVEN'T BEEN AT THE TABLE

02:38:11.782 --> 02:38:13.183
NEGOTIATING THIS SO I AM

02:38:13.250 --> 02:38:15.052
CONCERNED CAN YOU TALK TO US A

02:38:15.118 --> 02:38:17.654
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT BECAUSE-

02:38:17.721 --> 02:38:21.892
I'M- WE DID THIS BEFORE. WHEN

02:38:21.959 --> 02:38:24.261
WE TOOK A AT A WHOLE CATEGORY

02:38:24.328 --> 02:38:25.762
OF INDIVIDUALS THAT WOULD

02:38:25.829 --> 02:38:27.130
NORMALLY GO TO STATE PRISON WE

02:38:27.197 --> 02:38:30.801
SENT THEM TO THE COUNTY. AND I

02:38:30.868 --> 02:38:33.203
THINK THAT'S- WITH SOME

02:38:33.270 --> 02:38:36.173
EXCEPTIONS HAS BEEN A SUCCESS.

02:38:36.240 --> 02:38:38.208
BUT WE ALSO SEND A LOT OF MONEY

02:38:38.275 --> 02:38:40.410
AND SO I'M WONDERING WHY ARE

02:38:40.477 --> 02:38:43.847
THE COUNTIES CALLING ME SAYING

02:38:43.914 --> 02:38:45.549
WHAT THE F. AND THE- PROBATION

02:38:45.616 --> 02:38:47.718
CHIEFS IN PARTICULAR SAYING

02:38:47.784 --> 02:38:48.886
THAT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN AT THE

02:38:48.952 --> 02:38:50.621
TABLE THIS IS NOT PART OF WHAT

02:38:50.687 --> 02:38:57.060
THEY- WOULD HAVE AGREED. TO SO

02:38:57.127 --> 02:39:00.864
ADD THIS THERE HAS BEEN- AS I

02:39:00.931 --> 02:39:02.332
SAID STATED PREVIOUSLY

02:39:02.399 --> 02:39:04.701
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF DISCUSSION

02:39:04.768 --> 02:39:07.037
WITH THE COUNTY IS ON THE

02:39:07.104 --> 02:39:09.539
PROPOSAL OF REALIGNING- THE

02:39:09.606 --> 02:39:11.174
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE USED

02:39:11.241 --> 02:39:13.911
TO THEM AND- THE FINAL

02:39:13.977 --> 02:39:15.545
AGREEMENT EACH YEAR BEFORE YOU

02:39:15.612 --> 02:39:16.947
TODAY IS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN

02:39:17.014 --> 02:39:17.581
THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE

02:39:17.648 --> 02:39:19.449
LEGISLATURE. UNFORTUNATELY

02:39:19.516 --> 02:39:21.985
THERE ARE DETAILS IN HERE THAT

02:39:22.052 --> 02:39:22.953
THEY ARE NOT IN FULL AGREEMENT

02:39:23.020 --> 02:39:25.689
AND- WHICH IS PROBABLY WHY

02:39:25.756 --> 02:39:28.025
YOU'RE HEARING FROM THEM- SO IT

02:39:28.091 --> 02:39:31.028
YOU KNOW I THINK OVERALL WE DID

02:39:31.094 --> 02:39:33.797
OUR BEST TO INCORPORATE- INPUT

02:39:33.864 --> 02:39:38.168
FROM MULTIPLE SITES- AND YOU

02:39:38.235 --> 02:39:39.636
KNOW THIS IS A- AN INCREDIBLY

02:39:39.703 --> 02:39:41.838
IMPORTANT ISSUE AND INCREDIBLY

02:39:41.905 --> 02:39:44.641
IMPORTANT TIME AND- THAT'S WHY

02:39:44.708 --> 02:39:47.411
IT'S HERE BEING DONE NOW- AND I

02:39:47.477 --> 02:39:49.012
THINK THE THING THAT I WOULD.

02:39:49.079 --> 02:39:50.647
DESCRIBE IT- DID MENTION

02:39:50.714 --> 02:39:52.616
EARLIER IS THAT THIS IS GONNA

02:39:52.683 --> 02:39:56.153
BE A MULTI YEAR IMPLEMENTATION-

02:39:56.219 --> 02:39:58.422
BEGINNING NEXT YEAR OUR WORK IS

02:39:58.488 --> 02:39:59.723
JUST BE GONE ON IT THESE

02:39:59.790 --> 02:40:02.492
CONVERSATIONS ARE NOT OVER WE

02:40:02.559 --> 02:40:04.761
EXPECT TO CONTINUE DISCUSSING.

02:40:04.828 --> 02:40:07.230
THIS PROPOSAL- WITH ALL THE

02:40:07.297 --> 02:40:08.865
STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING OUR

02:40:08.932 --> 02:40:12.502
COUNTY PARTNERS AND SO- WE AND

02:40:12.569 --> 02:40:15.339
WE REALIZE THAT TODAY THERE- IN

02:40:15.405 --> 02:40:18.508
OPPOSITION TO THE BILL- BUT-

02:40:18.575 --> 02:40:19.743
OVERALL THEY HAVE BEEN A PART

02:40:19.810 --> 02:40:22.012
OF IT- WE DEFINITELY TRY TO

02:40:22.079 --> 02:40:24.614
INCORPORATE. MANY COMPONENTS-

02:40:24.681 --> 02:40:27.217
THAT THEY NEEDED CONSIDERATION-

02:40:27.284 --> 02:40:29.386
AND- AND YOU KNOW WE FEEL LIKE

02:40:29.453 --> 02:40:30.721
IT'S A GOOD BALANCE BETWEEN ALL

02:40:30.787 --> 02:40:33.623
SIDES- AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO

02:40:33.690 --> 02:40:34.725

REHABILITATION. WHICH REQUIRES

02:41:57.374 --> 02:42:00.077
A LOT OF PROGRAMMING. AND ONE

02:42:00.143 --> 02:42:01.945
AREA WHICH HAS BEEN NEGLECTED

HISTORICAL ONE THAT WAS UNDER

02:42:04.347 --> 02:42:06.917
THE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE.

02:42:06.983 --> 02:42:07.551
WHAT WHAT I CALL FOR THE BROKEN

02:42:07.617 --> 02:42:10.854
HEART. WHICH IS WHY OUR YOUTH

02:42:10.921 --> 02:42:13.924
SO MANY GET INTO DRUGS. ALCOHOL

02:42:13.990 --> 02:42:17.160
AND. CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR AND

02:42:17.227 --> 02:42:20.464

COUNTIES. AND AS TO THAT

02:43:13.817 --> 02:43:15.719

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I WANT

02:44:01.498 --> 02:44:02.365
TO FIRST THANK THE

02:44:02.432 --> 02:44:04.301
ADMINISTRATION FOR THE VERY

02:44:04.367 --> 02:44:06.269
PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS THAT

02:44:06.336 --> 02:44:07.571
HAVE BEEN HAPPENING OVER THE

02:44:07.637 --> 02:44:11.775
LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS. AND I

02:44:11.841 --> 02:44:13.543
FEEL THAT THIS IS COME A LONG

02:44:13.610 --> 02:44:16.446
WAY TOWARDS. I WANT TO PUT THIS

02:44:16.513 --> 02:44:20.116
INTO CONTEXT THAT. LAST YEAR

02:44:20.183 --> 02:44:23.887
READ THE LEGISLATURE ACTED ON

02:44:23.954 --> 02:44:27.324
THE GOVERNOR'S INISH INITIATIVE.

02:44:27.390 --> 02:44:29.159
WHICH THE GOVERNOR IN LAST

02:44:29.226 --> 02:44:31.394
YEAR'S WERE TO A YEAR AGO-

02:44:31.461 --> 02:44:35.799
BUDGET. PROPOSED TO MOVE THE

02:44:35.865 --> 02:44:39.269
ENTIRE- HANDLING OF JUVENILES

02:44:39.336 --> 02:44:42.038
WITHIN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM INTO

02:44:42.105 --> 02:44:42.606
THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND

02:44:42.672 --> 02:44:45.075
HUMAN SERVICES AND WAS VERY

02:44:45.141 --> 02:44:48.078
CLEAR THAT THE PURPOSE WAS THAT

02:44:48.144 --> 02:44:53.350
WE HAVE TO ACCEPT. AS WE OF- AS

02:44:53.416 --> 02:44:56.786
SCIENCE AND MEDICS MEDICINE AND

02:44:56.853 --> 02:44:57.387
EVERYTHING ELSE IS TELLING US

02:44:57.454 --> 02:45:02.859
THAT. JUVENILES WHO ARE IN OUR

02:45:02.926 --> 02:45:05.428
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. ARE

02:45:05.495 --> 02:45:08.465
NOT FULLY FORMED ADULTS ENACT

02:45:08.531 --> 02:45:10.734
FOR MANY OF THEM IT WAS A

02:45:10.800 --> 02:45:12.102
TRAUMA INCIDENT IT COULD BE A

02:45:12.168 --> 02:45:13.570
LEARNING DISABILITY IT COULD BE

02:45:13.637 --> 02:45:15.972
SO MANY THINGS THAT CAUSED

02:45:16.039 --> 02:45:18.241
DIFFERENT THINGS AND NOT AN

02:45:18.308 --> 02:45:20.910
ESSENTIAL CRIMINAL NATURE THAT

02:45:20.977 --> 02:45:23.280
CAUSED THEM TO. IN GAUGING

02:45:23.346 --> 02:45:24.914
WHATEVER BEHAVIORS LED THEM TO

02:45:24.981 --> 02:45:27.717
THAT SYSTEM. AND SO THERE WAS

02:45:27.784 --> 02:45:30.353
THIS EMBRACING OF THE GOVERNOR

02:45:30.420 --> 02:45:33.023
TO HELP ALL OF US LOOK ACT

02:45:33.089 --> 02:45:34.124
APPROACHING JUVENILES

02:45:34.190 --> 02:45:35.759
DIFFERENTLY THAN WE DO ADULTS

02:45:35.825 --> 02:45:37.494
NO WE ALL KNOW THE WE'VE ALWAYS

02:45:37.560 --> 02:45:39.562
APPROACHED EVEN KNOWS MUCH TO A

02:45:39.629 --> 02:45:41.598
DEGREE DIFFERENTLY. BUT HE

02:45:41.665 --> 02:45:43.300
REALLY ASKED US TO LOOK AT IT

02:45:43.366 --> 02:45:44.868
THROUGH THE LENS OF HEALTH AND

02:45:44.934 --> 02:45:47.671
HUMAN SERVICES. AND WE ADOPTED

02:45:47.737 --> 02:45:52.042
THAT. NOW A YEAR LATER OF

02:45:52.108 --> 02:45:54.177
COURSE WERE IN A PANDEMIC WERE

02:45:54.244 --> 02:45:56.579
IN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AND IN OUR

02:45:56.646 --> 02:45:58.815
ADOPTION OF THAT WE AND THE

02:45:58.882 --> 02:46:01.117
GOVERNOR WE'RE SEMI SILENT

02:46:01.184 --> 02:46:04.621
ABOUT WHAT WE WOULD DO WITH THE

02:46:04.688 --> 02:46:06.423
STATE FACILITIES WHERE WE NOW

02:46:06.489 --> 02:46:08.625
HAVE EIGHT HUNDRED KIDS THE

02:46:08.692 --> 02:46:09.959
DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE

02:46:10.026 --> 02:46:13.430
STATE FACILITIES- I THINK FIRST

02:46:13.496 --> 02:46:14.964
MANY PEOPLE THEN MAYBE THE

02:46:15.031 --> 02:46:16.199
GOVERNOR I DON'T SPEAK FOR HIM

02:46:16.266 --> 02:46:17.367
BUT I THINK IT WAS ANTICIPATED

02:46:17.434 --> 02:46:19.269
THAT OVER TIME. THOSE WOULD

02:46:19.336 --> 02:46:22.372
PROBABLY. CLOSE THAT THROUGH

02:46:22.439 --> 02:46:23.306
THIS HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

02:46:23.373 --> 02:46:25.408
MODEL THERE WOULD BE DEVELOPED

02:46:25.475 --> 02:46:27.010
VERY DIFFERENT APPROACHES. BUT

02:46:27.077 --> 02:46:28.845
I THINK WE'RE THE PLACE NOW

02:46:28.912 --> 02:46:32.449
WHERE. I'M A VERY MUCH THROUGH

02:46:32.515 --> 02:46:35.085
BUDGET REASONS AND ALSO BECAUSE

02:46:35.151 --> 02:46:37.721
COMMUNITIES AFFECTED ARE HAVE

02:46:37.787 --> 02:46:40.990
ADVOCATED FOR A LONG TIME THAT.

02:46:41.057 --> 02:46:42.459
THEY FEEL THAT THE YOUTH SHOULD

02:46:42.525 --> 02:46:44.627
BE CLOSER TO HOME THAT THEY'RE

02:46:44.694 --> 02:46:47.464
GOING TO HAVE BETTER TREATMENT

02:46:47.530 --> 02:46:49.566
BETTER- DID DIEM FIREMAN IS

02:46:49.632 --> 02:46:54.204
BETTER- IF THEY'RE NOT SENT OFF

02:46:54.270 --> 02:46:56.272
TO THE CENTRALIZED FACILITIES

02:46:56.339 --> 02:46:58.942
SO THE GOVERNOR CAME BACK TO US

02:46:59.008 --> 02:47:01.344
THIS YEAR AND SAID. LET'S GO

02:47:01.411 --> 02:47:05.348
WITH THE LOCAL APPROACH. AND

02:47:05.415 --> 02:47:07.150
BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT

02:47:07.217 --> 02:47:09.152
WAS INITIALLY PRESENTED TO US

02:47:09.219 --> 02:47:10.420
COMPARED TO LAST YEAR'S IT

02:47:10.487 --> 02:47:12.222
DIDN'T HALF THAT HEALTH CONCERT

02:47:12.288 --> 02:47:14.391
HUMAN SERVICES COMPONENT AND SO

02:47:14.457 --> 02:47:16.192
THE CONVERSATIONS OVER THE LAST

02:47:16.259 --> 02:47:17.861
COUPLE OF MONTHS HAVE BEEN HOW

02:47:17.927 --> 02:47:22.966
CAN WE ACHIEVE. THAT. THAT

02:47:23.032 --> 02:47:26.569
DESIRE TO. TREAT OUR KIDS

02:47:26.636 --> 02:47:28.772
WITHIN OUR LOCAL AREAS HAVE OUR

02:47:28.838 --> 02:47:31.074
COUNTIES WHICH IN MANY CASES NO

02:47:31.141 --> 02:47:33.610
I STARTED OUT- JUST LESS THAN

02:47:33.676 --> 02:47:36.746
TEN YEARS AGO. THERE WERE MORE

02:47:36.813 --> 02:47:39.482
THAN FOUR TIMES. THE NUMBER OF

02:47:39.549 --> 02:47:41.551
KIDS IN OUR STATE FACILITIES

02:47:41.618 --> 02:47:44.454
THAN TODAY SO WE KNOW OVER TIME

02:47:44.521 --> 02:47:45.588
MANY OF OUR COUNTIES HAVE JUST

02:47:45.655 --> 02:47:48.358
ON THEIR OWN ACTED TO TAKE MORE

02:47:48.425 --> 02:47:50.427
RESPONSIBILITY LOCALLY AND TO

02:47:50.493 --> 02:47:52.495
HANDLE THERE ARE KIDS IN

02:47:52.562 --> 02:47:53.997
DIFFERENT WAYS AND WE ALSO KNOW

02:47:54.063 --> 02:47:55.598
THAT MANY OF OUR OWN COUNTY

02:47:55.665 --> 02:47:57.267
JUVENILE HALLS HAVE MANY FEWER

02:47:57.333 --> 02:48:00.170
KIDS SO ARE COUNTIES THEMSELVES

02:48:00.236 --> 02:48:01.738
HAVE REALLY TAKEN AN INITIATIVE

02:48:01.805 --> 02:48:05.074
MANY OF THEM. TO APPROACH

02:48:05.141 --> 02:48:05.642
JUVENILE JUSTICE A DIFFERENT

02:48:05.708 --> 02:48:09.212
WAY. SO WE NOW HAVE FAR FEWER

02:48:09.279 --> 02:48:13.450
KIDS AND- THE N. MANY COUNTIES

02:48:13.516 --> 02:48:14.651
WERE SAYING YES WE CAN HANDLE

02:48:14.717 --> 02:48:16.586
THIS BUT OF COURSE THEY WANT TO

02:48:16.653 --> 02:48:19.222
SUPPORT AND SO WHAT I THINK

02:48:19.289 --> 02:48:23.860
THAT THIS. MODEL AND- I BUT IT

02:48:23.927 --> 02:48:25.962
IT IT'S DISAPPOINTING TO HAVE

02:48:26.029 --> 02:48:27.530
THE COUNTIES SO UNIFORMLY

02:48:27.597 --> 02:48:29.666
AGAINST AD I THINK REALLY IF.

02:48:29.732 --> 02:48:31.468
IF THEY LOOK AT IT A LITTLE

02:48:31.534 --> 02:48:32.902
CLOSER I DON'T THINK THAT THEY

02:48:32.969 --> 02:48:34.838
WOULD FIND IT SO OBJECTIONABLE

02:48:34.904 --> 02:48:37.307
NUMBER ONE. HALF OF A RURAL

02:48:37.373 --> 02:48:40.376
COUNTIES HAVE NO KIDS IN OUR

02:48:40.443 --> 02:48:42.946
STATE FACILITIES HALF. SO HALF

02:48:43.012 --> 02:48:45.148
OF A RULER COUNTIES RIGHT NOW.

02:48:45.215 --> 02:48:47.517
HAVE SAID NO CHILD NO EIGHT OF

02:48:47.584 --> 02:48:50.320
THE EIGHT HUNDRED. AND UNDER

02:48:50.386 --> 02:48:52.522
THE FOREIGN FUNDING FORMULA IF

02:48:52.589 --> 02:48:54.324
WE WENT WITH A FUNDING FORMULA

02:48:54.390 --> 02:48:56.226
THAT SAID. YOU WOULD ONLY BE

02:48:56.292 --> 02:48:59.195
FUNDED IF YOU SENT A KID TO DJJ

02:48:59.262 --> 02:49:00.997
HALF OF OUR RURAL COUNTIES

02:49:01.064 --> 02:49:03.566
WOULD GET NO MONEY. AND SO THIS

02:49:03.633 --> 02:49:05.768

OF COURSE WE ARE HOPING THAT IT

02:50:27.884 --> 02:50:29.786
OR NOT HOPING THAT MORE KIDS

02:50:29.852 --> 02:50:31.254

03:05:02.591 --> 03:05:03.058
TWENTY FIVE TO A THOUSAND

03:05:03.125 --> 03:05:05.427
DOLLARS TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS-

03:05:05.494 --> 03:05:07.663
YOU KNOW- AND THEN WE TALK

03:05:07.729 --> 03:05:11.033
ABOUT THE BOARD BEHAVIORAL-SCIENCES AND WE OFTEN TALK HERE

03:05:11.099 --> 03:05:13.635
IN THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT THE

03:05:13.702 --> 03:05:15.137
SHORTAGE WE HAVE. MENTAL HEALTH

03:05:15.204 --> 03:05:18.574
PROFESSIONALS. AND YOU KNOW

03:05:18.640 --> 03:05:20.442
WE'RE DOUBLING THE FEES FOR A

03:05:20.509 --> 03:05:23.745
LICENSED MARRIAGE FAMILY AND-

03:05:23.812 --> 03:05:25.814
EDUCATIONAL COLLEGES MORE

03:05:25.881 --> 03:05:28.250
DOUBLE HUNDRED TO FIFTY VOCAL

03:05:28.317 --> 03:05:29.785
SOCIAL WORKERS YOU KNOW

03:05:29.852 --> 03:05:34.323
DOUBLING. SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED

03:05:34.389 --> 03:05:36.558
FIFTY YOU KNOW AFRICAN LAZY A

03:05:36.625 --> 03:05:37.125
HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY I

03:05:37.192 --> 03:05:37.793
MEAN WE'RE TALKING DOUBLING

03:05:37.860 --> 03:05:40.195
TRIPLING THEIR FEES.

03:05:40.262 --> 03:05:42.598
REGISTRATION FEES AND THEN ON

03:05:42.664 --> 03:05:44.466
TOP OF THAT IF IT WASN'T BAD

03:05:44.533 --> 03:05:46.602
ENOUGH THAT WE ARE DOUBLING

03:05:46.668 --> 03:05:48.904
TRIPLING QUADRUPLING.THEIR

03:05:48.971 --> 03:05:51.073
FEES THEN WE SAY THE BOARD

03:05:51.139 --> 03:05:53.008
THEMSELVES CAN INCREASES HE IS

03:05:53.075 --> 03:05:55.911
AGAIN AND OFTENTIMES DOUBLING

03:05:55.978 --> 03:05:59.948
THEM AGAIN. AND SO THAT IS

03:06:00.015 --> 03:06:01.617
QUITE DISTURBING TO ME I WILL

03:06:01.683 --> 03:06:04.353
POINT OUT THAT I KNOW THAT THE-

03:06:04.419 --> 03:06:05.888
IT WAS A PREVIOUSLY A BILL THAT

03:06:05.954 --> 03:06:09.224
WAS REJECTED BY THE SENATE-

03:06:09.291 --> 03:06:11.059
THAT ACTUALLY ALLOWED THE BOARD

03:06:11.126 --> 03:06:12.094
TO RAISE FEES WITHOUT

03:06:12.160 --> 03:06:14.563
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. SO I

03:06:14.630 --> 03:06:17.566
GUESS THERE SIR TWO PARTS THAT-

03:06:17.633 --> 03:06:19.768
EXPRESSED CONCERN ONE IS THAT.

03:06:19.835 --> 03:06:20.602
YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE FEE

03:06:20.669 --> 03:06:22.571
INCREASE ITSELF AND I CERTAINLY

03:06:22.638 --> 03:06:24.573
UNDERSTAND SO PERHAPS A MORE

03:06:24.640 --> 03:06:26.041
INDEPTH DESTINATION THAT'S WHY

03:06:26.108 --> 03:06:28.110
WE NEED TO DOUBLE TRIPLE. THESE

03:06:28.176 --> 03:06:30.612
FEES AND THE FOLLOW UP IS THAT

03:06:30.679 --> 03:06:32.281
IF THAT IS INSUFFICIENT WHY IS

03:06:32.347 --> 03:06:33.849
THAT NOT SUFFICIENT ITSELF AND

03:06:33.916 --> 03:06:35.717
WHILE WE ALSO AUTHORIZING THE

03:06:35.784 --> 03:06:36.485
BOARD ITSELF WITHOUT

03:06:36.552 --> 03:06:38.654
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT TO DOUBLE

03:06:38.720 --> 03:06:40.656
THOSE FEES AGAIN. WHY NOT COME

03:06:40.722 --> 03:06:42.124
BACK TO LEGISLATURE AND SAY

03:06:42.190 --> 03:06:44.826
OKAY WELL. YOU DOUBLE THE FEES

03:06:44.893 --> 03:06:46.595
ON UB'S BECAUSE BASED ON THE

03:06:46.662 --> 03:06:48.964
WHATEVER INFORMATION YOU'RE-ABOUT TO TELL ME. WHY ARE WE

03:06:49.031 --> 03:06:50.065
ALLOWING THE BOARD THEN WE

03:06:50.132 --> 03:06:51.300
DOUBLE THE FEES WITHOUT COMING

03:06:51.366 --> 03:06:52.734
BACK TO LEGISLATION EXPLAINING

03:06:52.801 --> 03:06:55.304
WHY WHAT IS IT THAT'S GOING ON.

03:06:55.370 --> 03:06:57.606
IN THAT REGARD SO I IT ALSO

03:06:57.673 --> 03:06:58.173
SOME QUESTION ABOUT YOUR THE

03:06:58.240 --> 03:07:01.677
LET'S START WITH THIS. FINANCE

03:07:01.743 --> 03:07:05.614
THANK YOU DR PAN. I THINK OF IT

03:07:05.681 --> 03:07:07.182
IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT IT'S

03:07:07.249 --> 03:07:09.151
COMING SIDING WITH THE ECONOMIC

03:07:09.217 --> 03:07:10.152
RECESSION THAT'S TAKING PLACE

03:07:10.218 --> 03:07:12.087
RIGHT NOW BUT FOR SOME OF THESE

03:07:12.154 --> 03:07:13.422
LIKE ACUPUNCTURE BOARD HASN'T

03:07:13.488 --> 03:07:15.524
RAISE THE FEES IN THIRTY FIVE

03:07:15.591 --> 03:07:17.826
YEARS SO. WHEN IT'S OVER A

03:07:17.893 --> 03:07:18.927
PERIOD OF TIME THAT IS THAT

03:07:18.994 --> 03:07:21.163

APPRECIATE YOU SAID THAT

03:07:21.730 --> 03:07:23.732
ALREADY. SO IT HAS A VERY

03:07:23.799 --> 03:07:24.967
SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE BECAUSE OF

03:07:25.033 --> 03:07:28.303
THE TIME OKAY. LET ME POSE. AND

03:07:28.370 --> 03:07:29.237
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TRYING TO

03:07:29.304 --> 03:07:30.472
RECALL THE LAST TIME THEY WERE

03:07:30.539 --> 03:07:33.308
BEFORE OUR COMMITTEE BECAUSE IT

03:07:33.375 --> 03:07:34.977
SAID. THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY

03:07:35.043 --> 03:07:36.578
BOTH HAVE COMMITTEES THAT

03:07:36.645 --> 03:07:38.914
OVERSEE THESE BOARDS- THAT THE-

03:07:38.981 --> 03:07:40.315
IT'S COMMITTEE ON BUSINESS

03:07:40.382 --> 03:07:41.416
PROFESSIONS AND ECONOMIC

03:07:41.483 --> 03:07:42.618
DEVELOPMENT HERE IN THE SENATE

03:07:42.684 --> 03:07:44.219

BECAUSE I'M A MEMBER OF THE

03:07:47.789 --> 03:07:48.857
COMMITTEE WE ASKED ABOUT THEIR

03:07:48.924 --> 03:07:50.192
FINANCES AND DO THEY HAVE

03:07:50.258 --> 03:07:52.094
ADEQUATE RESOURCES. AND SO

03:07:52.160 --> 03:07:53.161
USUALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY

YOU I KNOW YOU SAID THAT HE HAS

03:08:00.736 --> 03:08:02.504
AN INCREASE IN TWENTY YEARS.

03:08:02.571 --> 03:08:03.905
I'M CURIOUS WHAT HAS HAPPENED

03:08:03.972 --> 03:08:06.274
SUDDENLY. THAT AT LEAST SINCE

03:08:06.341 --> 03:08:07.476
THE LAST TIME THEY HAD A SUNSET

03:08:07.542 --> 03:08:09.144
REVIEW THAT'S HAPPENED THAT'S

03:08:09.211 --> 03:08:10.979
NOW SAID THAT THEIR THAT THEIR

03:08:11.046 --> 03:08:12.648
FINANCIAL SITUATION SUDDENLY

03:08:12.714 --> 03:08:13.415
DECLINED SO IT'S NOT TWENTY

03:08:13.482 --> 03:08:14.950
YEAR DECLINE. IT'S A MUCH

03:08:15.017 --> 03:08:15.851
SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME SINCE

03:08:15.917 --> 03:08:17.853
LAST SUNSET REVIEW I WHICH I

03:08:17.919 --> 03:08:18.654
CAN'T RECALL TO TOP MY HEAD

03:08:18.720 --> 03:08:20.355
EXACTLY WHEN LASSEN TO REVIEW

03:08:20.422 --> 03:08:22.157
IS FOR THESE BOARDS BUT- YOU

03:08:22.224 --> 03:08:23.792
KNOW WE DO THEM. FAIRLY

03:08:23.859 --> 03:08:26.061
REGULARLY SO IT'S BY LIKE FOUR

03:08:26.128 --> 03:08:30.232
OR FIVE YEARS AT THE OUTSET THE

03:08:30.298 --> 03:08:30.799
LONGEST AND PROBABLY SHORTER

03:08:30.866 --> 03:08:31.733
THAN THAT. SO WHAT'S HAPPENED

03:08:31.800 --> 03:08:33.902
RECENTLY. IT'S NOT SOMETHING

03:08:33.969 --> 03:08:35.971
HAPPENED TWENTY YEARS AGO. NO

03:08:36.038 --> 03:08:37.339
I'LL I'LL ASK TWENTY SAID

03:08:37.406 --> 03:08:38.807
CALLING FOR ASSISTANCE IN A

03:08:38.874 --> 03:08:41.176
MOMENT BUT I THINK- PART OF IT

03:08:41.243 --> 03:08:42.878
TOO IS OF THE BOARDS HAVE.

03:08:42.944 --> 03:08:43.945
TRYING TO BE RESPONSIBLE WITH

03:08:44.012 --> 03:08:46.214
THEIR FUNDS OVER TIME AND YOU

03:08:46.281 --> 03:08:47.315
KNOW TO SAVE MONEY WHERE THEY

03:08:47.382 --> 03:08:49.518
COULD END UP SORT BECAUSE THEY

03:08:49.584 --> 03:08:50.218
WEREN'T PAID FOR AND MORE

03:08:50.285 --> 03:08:52.721
DUTIES- MORE LICENSING REVIEWS

03:08:52.788 --> 03:08:54.189
MAR APPLICATIONS AND THINGS

03:08:54.256 --> 03:08:55.290
LIKE THAT AND THEY'RE AT THE

03:08:55.357 --> 03:08:56.425
POINT NOW WHERE THEY CAN'T.

03:08:56.491 --> 03:08:58.393
THEY DON'T HAVE ANYMORE. GIVE

03:08:58.460 --> 03:09:00.028
LEFT SO THAT'S WHY THEY'RE

03:09:00.095 --> 03:09:01.029
COMING NOW BECAUSE THEY'VE

03:09:01.096 --> 03:09:02.497
TRIED TO MAKE DO OVER THIS

03:09:02.564 --> 03:09:04.733
PERIOD OF TIME. AND IN SOME OF

03:09:04.800 --> 03:09:05.834
THE REVIEWS SAID THAT WE CAN

03:09:05.901 --> 03:09:08.770
MANAGE IT MORE YOU KNOW WORKING

03:09:08.837 --> 03:09:09.337
WITH AND WHAT WE HAVE. AND

03:09:09.404 --> 03:09:11.707
THEY'RE AT THE POINT WHERE THEY

03:09:11.773 --> 03:09:12.674
CAN'T DO THAT ANYMORE. OKAY SO.

03:09:12.741 --> 03:09:14.509
IS THE FEE INCREASE THAT YOU'RE

03:09:14.576 --> 03:09:16.878
ASKING THAT WE APPROVE. JUSTIN

03:09:16.945 --> 03:09:18.280
OURSELVES SO WE'RE DOUBLING

03:09:18.346 --> 03:09:19.181
TRIPLING QUADRUPLING SOME OF

03:09:19.247 --> 03:09:21.316
THESE FEES. IS THAT SUFFICIENT

03:09:21.383 --> 03:09:23.118
WHY IS THE BOARD NOW AUTHOR

03:09:23.185 --> 03:09:24.619
ALSO BEING AUTHORIZED TO DOUBLE

03:09:24.686 --> 03:09:26.288
THOSE FEES AGAIN WITH A DOUBLE

03:09:26.354 --> 03:09:27.923
DOUBLE THAT'S AFTER THE MAX OUT

03:09:27.989 --> 03:09:29.291
OF WHAT WE'RE ALLOWING THEM.

03:09:29.357 --> 03:09:30.225
AND THEN YOU'RE SAYING LET'S

03:09:30.292 --> 03:09:31.593
DOUBLE IT AGAIN WITH BOARD

03:09:31.660 --> 03:09:32.928

OVERSIGHT TO HOW MUCH MONEY DO

03:09:34.563 --> 03:09:35.597
WE REALLY NEED TO INCREASE THE

03:09:35.664 --> 03:09:36.932
FEES. THAT WE SHOULD BE

03:09:36.998 --> 03:09:39.034
OVERSEEING. AND NOT WITHOUT

03:09:39.101 --> 03:09:40.102
HAVING TO GIVE THE BOARD IT'S

03:09:40.168 --> 03:09:41.269

03:09:41.336 --> 03:09:42.471
WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT

03:09:42.537 --> 03:09:43.839
WHICH IS REALLY PROBLEMATIC

03:09:43.905 --> 03:09:46.908
BECAUSE THAT'S A POLICY WE

03:09:46.975 --> 03:09:48.977
REJECTED AS A SENATE EARLIER.

03:09:49.044 --> 03:09:50.579

SEVENTY FIVE TO ONE FIFTY SO

03:10:15.170 --> 03:10:16.004
YOU'RE DOUBLING IT. NAY SAYING

03:10:16.071 --> 03:10:17.539
THE BOARD ITSELF CAN DOUBLE IT

03:10:17.606 --> 03:10:19.141
AGAIN NOW THE THREE HUNDRED-

03:10:19.207 --> 03:10:20.742
LICENSES THE EDUCATIONAL THAT

OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN SO

03:10:34.890 --> 03:10:36.324
WHAT'S GOING ON. WHY IS THE

03:10:36.391 --> 03:10:37.425
BOARD BEING GIVEN THIS

03:10:37.492 --> 03:10:39.294

03:11:12.194 --> 03:11:15.030
IT'S NOT WITHOUT INPUT JUST

03:11:15.096 --> 03:11:16.431
BECAUSE IT'S SET AT A LEVEL NOW.

03:11:16.498 --> 03:11:17.666
DEPARTMENT CONSUMER STILL HAS

03:11:17.732 --> 03:11:19.167
TO GO THROUGH REGULATORY-

03:11:19.234 --> 03:11:21.169
REGULATION PROCESS. AND THEY

03:11:21.236 --> 03:11:22.437
TALKED ABOUT THESE FEES WITH

03:11:22.504 --> 03:11:24.139
THEIR STAKEHOLDERS SANTA OKAY.

03:11:24.206 --> 03:11:26.074
IT'S A REGULATORY PROCESS A PRE

03:11:26.141 --> 03:11:26.975
SHEET THAT I WANT TO BE

03:11:27.042 --> 03:11:28.276
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WE'VE

03:11:28.343 --> 03:11:30.312
REJECTED AS POLICY HERE IN THE

03:11:30.378 --> 03:11:32.314
SENATE. THE AUTHORITY YOU GET

03:11:32.380 --> 03:11:34.115
THE BOARD TO INCREASE THE SEAS.

03:11:34.182 --> 03:11:35.951
WITHOUT THE LEGISLATURE. WHICH

03:11:36.017 --> 03:11:37.452
IS WITH ETHICALLY WHAT YOU'RE

03:11:37.519 --> 03:11:38.086
ASKING US TO DO BECAUSE YOU'RE

03:11:38.153 --> 03:11:39.287
SAYING WE'RE GOING TO INCREASE

03:11:39.354 --> 03:11:40.622
THE FEES FROM WHATEVER TO YOU

03:11:40.689 --> 03:11:42.424
KNOW THIS EX NUMBER. AND THEN

03:11:42.490 --> 03:11:43.758
WE GAVE THE BOARD AUTHORITY TO

03:11:43.825 --> 03:11:45.861
AGAIN DOUBLE IT AGAIN. IN MANY

03:11:45.927 --> 03:11:48.129
CASES. AND I THINK THAT'S VERY

03:11:48.196 --> 03:11:49.798
PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE THAT'S NO

03:11:49.865 --> 03:11:50.966
DIFFERENT POLICY DECISION

03:11:51.032 --> 03:11:53.368
YOU'VE EMBEDDED IN HERE- SO

03:11:53.435 --> 03:11:54.769
WELL I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT.

INCREASING THE FEES I ALSO

03:11:55.904 --> 03:11:57.272
UNDERSTAND WE WANT TO BOARD THE

03:11:57.339 --> 03:11:58.573

03:11:58.640 --> 03:12:04.512
THE SAME. SIDE ON THAT WE WANT

03:12:04.579 --> 03:12:05.113

WILL ME THE BOARD AUTHORITY TO

03:12:09.584 --> 03:12:11.019
INCREASE THE FEES EVEN FURTHER

03:12:11.086 --> 03:12:13.788
WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT

03:12:13.855 --> 03:12:14.256
TO KNOW IS WHY IS THE

03:12:14.322 --> 03:12:16.191
LEGISLATURE NOT. IT IS

03:12:16.258 --> 03:12:17.359
BASICALLY LEGISLATION BE

03:12:17.425 --> 03:12:19.427
APPROVING ANY FEE INCREASES.

03:12:19.494 --> 03:12:20.462
RIGHT AND OF COURSE YOU SHOULD

03:12:20.528 --> 03:12:22.163
HAVE A RECORD PROCESS WHERE YOU

WHERE WE DON'T HAVE AS MUCH

03:12:47.055 --> 03:12:48.256
TIME FOR EXPLANATION AND THEN

03:12:48.323 --> 03:12:49.858
WE'RE GOING TO. ALLOW THE BOARD

03:12:49.925 --> 03:12:51.192

GONNA BE ABLE TO DOUBLE IT

03:12:57.465 --> 03:12:59.734
AGAIN. THAT SEEMS TO ME TO BE

03:12:59.801 --> 03:13:01.569
VERY INAPPROPRIATE. MISMAS

03:13:01.636 --> 03:13:03.538
HARBISON IF YOU COULD RESPOND

03:13:03.605 --> 03:13:04.606

WHICH IS YOU KNOW WHY CREATE

03:13:07.542 --> 03:13:09.477
THIS AUTOPILOT OPPORTUNITY TO

INCREASE THE FEES AS OPPOSED

03:13:11.513 --> 03:13:14.349
TO. THE EXISTING LEGISLATIVE.

03:13:14.416 --> 03:13:18.753
INFRASTRUCTURE. I THINK THAT

03:13:18.820 --> 03:13:19.454
WOULD BE HELPFUL. IF YOU CAN

03:13:19.521 --> 03:13:22.891
THANK SENATE WEST. I THIS IS US

03:13:22.958 --> 03:13:24.459
ASKING FOR LEGISLATIVE

03:13:24.526 --> 03:13:27.529
OVERSIGHT TO SAY WE THINK. THIS

03:13:27.595 --> 03:13:28.363
IS WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE NOW AND

03:13:28.430 --> 03:13:29.464
WE CAN SEE IN THE FUTURE IT MAY

03:13:29.531 --> 03:13:31.032
NEED TO GO UP TO. AN ADDITIONAL

03:13:31.099 --> 03:13:34.636
LEVEL. THAT WE WOULD ASK THAT

03:13:34.703 --> 03:13:36.771
YOU. YOU KNOW IMPROVE. THAT

03:13:36.838 --> 03:13:38.306
MUCH LEEWAY FOR THE DEPARTMENT

03:13:38.373 --> 03:13:39.374
THROUGH REGULATION IN

03:13:39.441 --> 03:13:40.775
COMMUNICATION. WITH

03:13:40.842 --> 03:13:44.379
STAKEHOLDERS WITH THE PUBLIC-

03:13:44.446 --> 03:13:44.980
SAY THIS IS THE THRESHOLD THAT

03:13:45.046 --> 03:13:47.782
YOU. I GO TO AND THEN AFTER

03:13:47.849 --> 03:13:48.416
THAT YOU NEED TO COME BACK TO

03:13:48.483 --> 03:13:50.185
THE LEGISLATURE AGAIN-

03:13:50.251 --> 03:13:51.720
ESPECIALLY THIS YEAR I THINK

03:13:51.786 --> 03:13:52.354
YOU KNOW WE PROPOSE THESE

03:13:52.420 --> 03:13:54.155
EARLIER IN THE YEAR. IT WAS

03:13:54.222 --> 03:13:55.123
DEFERRED IN JUNE BECAUSE OF

03:13:55.190 --> 03:13:56.925
COMENZó JUST THE UNCERTAINTY

03:13:56.992 --> 03:13:59.561
ABOUT THINGS BY OUT AND TIMING.

03:13:59.627 --> 03:14:00.628
I THINK THIS IS AN EXTRA

03:14:00.695 --> 03:14:02.130
MEASURE TO BE SURE THAT WE CAN

03:14:02.197 --> 03:14:04.299
BE RESPONSIVE. TO THE NEEDS OF

03:14:04.366 --> 03:14:05.667
THE DEPARTMENTS TO MAKE SURE

03:14:05.734 --> 03:14:06.634
THAT WE'RE PROVIDING CONSUMER

03:14:06.701 --> 03:14:09.204
PROTECTION THAT WERE NOT

03:14:09.270 --> 03:14:11.639
DELAYED AND HAVING. YOU KNOW.

03:14:11.706 --> 03:14:14.175
FUNDS THAT ARE IN ARE. OVER

03:14:14.242 --> 03:14:16.778
JOHN. WELL I THINK YOU NEED TO

03:14:16.845 --> 03:14:18.179
DO A MUCH BETTER JOB OF

03:14:18.246 --> 03:14:20.715
EXPLAINING. THE FEES AND

03:14:20.782 --> 03:14:23.852
FRANKLY- THEY SAID- YOU'RE

03:14:23.918 --> 03:14:25.487
TAKING YOUR MOVING TAKING

03:14:25.553 --> 03:14:26.154
SOMETHING ELSE BRAG OF THE

03:14:26.221 --> 03:14:29.224
LEGISLATURE. AND UNFORTUNATELY

03:14:29.290 --> 03:14:30.191
I DO NOT FIND YOUR ANSWERS

03:14:30.258 --> 03:14:31.826
SATISFACTORY IN THAT REGARD I

03:14:31.893 --> 03:14:33.328
THINK IF YOU SIMPLY PRESENTED

03:14:33.395 --> 03:14:35.230
US A SET UP FEE INCREASES AND

03:14:35.296 --> 03:14:36.698
PRESENTS THE EVIDENCE FOR WHY

03:14:36.765 --> 03:14:38.400
YOU NEEDED IT. THAT WOULD HAVE

03:14:38.466 --> 03:14:40.435
BEEN FINE FOR ME EVEN THOUGH I

03:14:40.502 --> 03:14:42.937
RECOGNIZE AS- THAT. BILLS FEES

03:14:43.004 --> 03:14:44.239
ARE AND HOW TO PEOPLE ARE

03:14:44.305 --> 03:14:45.673
PAYING THEM IT'S AN INCREASE ON

03:14:45.740 --> 03:14:47.075
THE SOMETHING THEY HAVE TO PAY.

03:14:47.142 --> 03:14:49.477
RIGHT BUT TO GIVE YOURSELF ALSO

03:14:49.544 --> 03:14:50.578
THE GRANT THE BOARDS THE

03:14:50.645 --> 03:14:52.347
AUTHORITY AFTER DATES AFTER.

03:14:52.414 --> 03:14:54.315
THE SENATE HAS REJECTED THAT IN

03:14:54.382 --> 03:14:55.717
THE PAST. IS A THREE TO

03:14:55.784 --> 03:14:56.785
INCREASE THE FEES WITHOUT

03:14:56.851 --> 03:14:57.852
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND

03:14:57.919 --> 03:14:59.354
FORESEES A STEP TOO FAR AND I'M

03:14:59.421 --> 03:15:00.922
AND UNFORTUNATELY I'M ABLE TO

03:15:00.989 --> 03:15:02.257
SUPPORT. THIS PROPOSAL BECAUSE

03:15:02.323 --> 03:15:04.125
OF THAT HE STRIPPED OUT THAT

03:15:04.192 --> 03:15:05.293
PERHAPS WILL BE DIFFERENT. LET

03:15:05.360 --> 03:15:06.728
ME JUST TOUCH BRIEFLY ON CURES

03:15:06.795 --> 03:15:10.698
I APPRECIATE. THE CHAIR GIVING

03:15:10.765 --> 03:15:11.299
INTELLIGENCE. REGARDING THE-

03:15:11.366 --> 03:15:13.034
INCREASE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE

03:15:13.101 --> 03:15:14.035
THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CURES

03:15:14.102 --> 03:15:16.805
DATA SYSTEM- SOMEONE WHO AGAIN

03:15:16.871 --> 03:15:18.907
HAS TO USE THE SYSTEM. THIS

03:15:18.973 --> 03:15:20.708
EXPANSION OF THE CARE SYSTEM IS

03:15:20.775 --> 03:15:22.844
THIS TO ALLOW PEOPLE WHO ARE

03:15:22.911 --> 03:15:25.480
NOT LICENSED. THE LICENSEES WHO

03:15:25.547 --> 03:15:26.448
ARE ACTUALLY PAYING INTO THE

03:15:26.514 --> 03:15:28.516
SYSTEM IT TAKES EXPAND ACCESS

03:15:28.583 --> 03:15:30.218
TO THE TO ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL

03:15:30.285 --> 03:15:31.219
BEYOND PEOPLE WHO HOLD

03:15:31.286 --> 03:15:38.259
LICENSES. TO CARE SYSTEM. ARE

03:15:38.326 --> 03:15:39.360
YOU REFERRING TO THE DELEGATES

03:15:39.427 --> 03:15:41.229
DR GRANT I AM TALKING ABOUT THE

03:15:41.296 --> 03:15:42.530
CARE SYSTEM SOBRE INCREASING

03:15:42.597 --> 03:15:43.832
THE FEES OF THE CURE TO THE

03:15:43.898 --> 03:15:45.500
CARE SYSTEM TO SUPPORT

03:15:45.567 --> 03:15:48.103
EXPANSION THE CARE SYSTEM. IS

03:15:48.169 --> 03:15:49.537
TO EXPAND SO THAT THE CARE

03:15:49.604 --> 03:15:50.672
SYSTEM IS NOW ACCEPTABLE TO

03:15:50.738 --> 03:15:53.341
PEOPLE BEYOND THE PEOPLE WHO

03:15:53.408 --> 03:15:53.908
ARE LICENSED FOR PAYING THE

03:15:53.975 --> 03:15:56.010
FEES. SO THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER

03:15:56.077 --> 03:15:58.346
OF BILLS IN RECENT YEARS- FOR

03:15:58.413 --> 03:15:59.714
THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THAT

03:15:59.781 --> 03:16:02.984
DEPARTMENT JST AS THE C. P. IN

03:16:03.051 --> 03:16:03.551
TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY

03:16:03.618 --> 03:16:04.219
AND THERE'S ONE THAT'S ACTUALLY

03:16:04.285 --> 03:16:05.453
INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET BILL

03:16:05.520 --> 03:16:07.422
JUNIOR THAT WE HEARD. EARLIER

03:16:07.489 --> 03:16:09.824
THIS EVENING- AB EIGHTY SIX

03:16:09.891 --> 03:16:12.460
AND- THAT COMPONENT FOR EIGHTY

03:16:12.527 --> 03:16:12.994
FIVE TWENTY EIGHT HAS ONE

03:16:13.061 --> 03:16:14.462
POINT. FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN

03:16:14.529 --> 03:16:16.498
FEES SO. THE ANSWER IS YES OR

03:16:16.564 --> 03:16:17.932
NO I THINK IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE

03:16:17.999 --> 03:16:19.434
QUESTION IS IT TO EXPAND THE

03:16:19.501 --> 03:16:21.302
CARE SYSTEM FOR USE OF PEOPLE

03:16:21.369 --> 03:16:22.003
BEYOND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

03:16:22.070 --> 03:16:24.272
LICENSED WHO ARE PAYING THIS

03:16:24.339 --> 03:16:28.877
FEE. SO. IS DOING A NUMBER OF

03:16:28.943 --> 03:16:31.479
THINGS WHICH I WAS TRYING.

03:16:31.546 --> 03:16:32.413
METHODICALLY IF YOU'D GO AHEAD

03:16:32.480 --> 03:16:33.915
WITH YOUR EXPLANATION THAT'S

03:16:33.982 --> 03:16:36.417
FINE HE GO AHEAD. AND SO THERE

03:16:36.484 --> 03:16:37.752
ARE DELEGATES THE USER SYSTEM

03:16:37.819 --> 03:16:39.087
AND THEY ARE NOT BEING CHARGED

03:16:39.154 --> 03:16:40.588
FEES BECAUSE THEY ARE OFTEN

03:16:40.655 --> 03:16:42.223
UTILIZING THE SYSTEM ON BEHALF

03:16:42.290 --> 03:16:44.526
OF THE LICENSEE. SO FOR EXAMPLE

03:16:44.592 --> 03:16:45.460
IN A DOCTOR'S OFFICE YOU MIGHT

03:16:45.527 --> 03:16:47.595
HAVE. THE MEDICAL ASSISTANT OR

03:16:47.662 --> 03:16:49.831
TECHNICIAN. ACCESS CURES BUT

03:16:49.898 --> 03:16:50.498
THEY'RE NOT DOING IT

03:16:50.565 --> 03:16:51.866
INDEPENDENTLY THEY'RE DOING IT

03:16:51.933 --> 03:16:53.801
ON BEHALF OF A LICENSEE SO WE

03:16:53.868 --> 03:16:55.236
DON'T THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO

03:16:55.303 --> 03:16:55.970
TRY TO THE MEDITATIONAL FEE TO

03:16:56.037 --> 03:16:58.640
DO THE WORK OF. THAT DOCTOR'S

03:16:58.706 --> 03:17:02.443
OFFICE. OKAY WELL I THINK THAT-

03:17:02.510 --> 03:17:04.712
REGARDING THE CARE SYSTEM. I

03:17:04.779 --> 03:17:07.015
BELIEVE THAT IT SHOULDN'T IF WE

03:17:07.081 --> 03:17:08.783
DO EXPAND THE SYSTEM BEYOND THE

03:17:08.850 --> 03:17:09.784
POINT AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR

03:17:09.851 --> 03:17:11.686
POINT ABOUT IF SOMEONE'S ACTING

03:17:11.753 --> 03:17:13.955
AS AN AGENT ON BEHALF OF A

03:17:14.022 --> 03:17:15.557
LICENSE PERSON THAT'S DIFFERENT

03:17:15.623 --> 03:17:16.891
BUT IF WE'RE GONNA EXPAND THE

03:17:16.958 --> 03:17:18.426
SYSTEM ANYWAY BEYOND THE PEOPLE

03:17:18.493 --> 03:17:21.796
WHO ARE LICENSE. THEN THAT COST

03:17:21.863 --> 03:17:22.897
SHOULD BE BORNE MORE BROADLY
