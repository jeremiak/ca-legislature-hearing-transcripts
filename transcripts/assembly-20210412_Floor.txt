PLEASE DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO MR TAKE MR TANG YOU MAY OPEN. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I AM PROUD TO PRESENT SB EIGHTY FIVE WHICH IS OUR WILDFIRE EARLY ACTION PROPOSAL AT A TIME WHEN MANY SCIENTISTS ARE TALKING ABOUT HOW THIS IS ONE OF THE DRIEST YEARS EVER. WE'VE HAD A STRING OF YEARS WHERE WE'VE HAD. CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES THE WATER OF WILDFIRE THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT EARLY INVESTMENT. IN MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE DOING. FORCE RESILIENCY PROJECTS **** WILDFIRE PREVENTION IN A WHOLE HOST. OF OTHER PROPOSALS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING EVERY PART. THIS IS THE ONLY THE ONLY OPTION PROPOSAL WE ANTICIPATE DOING EVEN MORE. IN THIS YEAR'S UPCOMING BUDGET. OF THE APPROPRIATION IS A FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION TOTAL FUNDING FOR THESE PROJECTS. MANY OF THESE INVESTMENTS ARE. ACTUAL SHOVEL READY PROJECTS ARE READY. TO HAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW FOR A FULL TIME TAKE ACTION AND TO GET AHEAD. OF THIS SUMMER AND THIS FALL. THERE ALSO ARE SOME TECHNICAL CHANGES FOR SUPPORT FOR RESOURCE FAMILIES IN FOSTER CARE AND A COUPLE OTHER. AGAINST TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE ON SB EIGHTY FIVE. THANK YOU MISTER TANK MR FONG YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I THANK YOU MR SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB EIGHTY FIVE. WE ARE ANTICIPATING ANOTHER POTENTIALLY VERY BAD WILD FIRE SEASON. WE ALL REMEMBER THE INCREDIBLE TOLL AND DEVASTATION OF PRIOR YEARS IN WHICH SO MANY FAMILIES WERE DEVASTATED DUE TO OUT OF CONTROL WILDFIRES. OUR FORESTS ARE FILLED WITH DEAD AND DYING TREES WE HAVE AGING UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE AND A HARSH DROUGHT WILL CRIPPLE OUR ABILITY TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. FROM DEADLY WILDFIRES YOU MUST UTILIZE EVERY PROVEN WILDFIRE PREVENTION TOOL IN MITIGATION TACTIC. TO REPAIR FOR THE SEASON SB EIGHTY FIVE GETS US IN A BETTER POSITION TO COMBAT THE IMPENDING WILDFIRE SEASON. COMMITMENTS MADE IN SB NINE OH ONE GUARANTEED FUNDING TOWARDS IMPROVING FOREST HEALTH AND CRITICAL FUEL REDUCTION PROJECTS. AND TODAY. WE ARE HOLDING TRUE TO THAT COMMITMENT. WE MUST CAN THIS FUNDING FOR. FUTURE YEARS A FORCE MANAGEMENT AS WE MOVE FORWARD I URGE AN AYE VOTE ON SB EIGHTY FIVE. THANK YOU MR FONG MR BLOOM YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND I WANT TO THANK- OUR BUDGET YOU'RE ON A BUDGET VICE CHAIR FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS AS WELL AS- THE WORKING GROUP FIVE SPEAKER STAFF- THIS WAS REALLY A COLLECTIVE EFFORT- IT'S NOTEWORTHY FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS ONE IS. WE'RE REALLY DOUBLING DOWN ON THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE ARE MAKING AVAILABLE TO SPEND ON PREVENTION. THIS IS- RIGHT NOW FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. LAST YEAR IN THE DEVASTATING. OCCUPIERS OF- THAT WE'RE STATE WIDE IF YOU LOOK AT THE MAP THEY WERE FROM ONE END TO THE STATE TO THE OTHER IN OVER FOUR. POINT FOUR MILLION ACRES BURNED IN THE STATE. WE SPENT NINE BILLION DOLLARS FIGHTING THOSE FIRES WE TAKE AWAY NOTHING FROM THE FIREFIGHTING EFFORT THAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE WE KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE FIRES BUT WE NEED TO START DOING PREVENTION WORK. AND THIS IS A DOWN PAYMENT IT GETS US STARTED. IT'S ALSO NOTEWORTHY BECAUSE WE'RE DOING IT EARLY WE'RE DOING IT NOW THE MONEY THAT WE'RE- HOPEFULLY GOING TO APPROVE TODAY WILL START TO FLOW VIRTUALLY IMMEDIATELY AND THE AGENCIES AND FOLKS WHO WERE. GOING TO PUT IN A REQUEST FOR THIS MONEY ARE READY TO ACT AND START ROLLING OUT THEIR EFFORTS ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. CALIFORNIA IS THE SOURCES OF- OF WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA- ARE AS DIVERSE AS THE STATE ITSELF. AND SO ONE OTHER IMPORTANT WITH THIS PREVENTION EFFORT IS THAT THE EARLY ACTION AND HOPEFULLY FUTURE ACTIONS WILL TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE REGIONAL FIRE PREVENTION NEEDS ADDRESSING DIFFERENT PREVENTION METHODS FOR. EXAMPLE WIN FUEL CHAPARRAL FIRES THAT WE SEE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VERSUS. THE TYPES OF FIRES THAT WE SEE IN THE SIERRAS WHERE THEY ARE VEGETARIAN VEGETATION FUELED. I AND- MOVE THROUGH TOWERING DRIVE FOR US. THE EARLY BUDGET ACTION INCREASES CREWS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO CAL FIRE IT PROVIDES MONEY FOR HOME HARDENING FOR OLDER HOMES FIRE PREVENTION GRANTS AND FIRE PREVENTION FUNDING FOR THE STATE'S CONSERVANCY'S. IN THE YEAR WERE COMING OFF THIS DEADLY WILDFIRE SEASON FACED WITH DROUGHT LIKE CONDITIONS RIGHT NOW AND RECORD LOW RAINFALL RECORD HIGH TEMPERATURES PLANTS AND TREES AROUND THE STATE ARE VERY STRESSED RESULTING IN DRIER AND MORE DANGEROUS CONDITIONS. THEN THIS STATE HAS EVER SEEN THIS FUNDING COULD NOT COME AT A MORE CRUCIAL TIME AND I HOPE YOU'LL JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING THIS LIFESAVING EARLY BUDGET ACTION. THANK YOU MISTER BLOOM MISTER RODRIGUEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER MEMBERS ARE RISING SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT BUDGET MEASURE AS CHAIR OF THE MERTON TO MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE WE HAVE TO BE READY ARE MERGED TO RESPOND AS A SYSTEMS NEED TO BE READY UP AND DOWN THE STATE AND CALIFORNIANS NEED TO BE READY AT THEIR HOMES AND PLACES OF WORK. THE THREE HUNDRED FORTY SIX MILLION FOR CALIFORNIA BEGIN THIS CRITICAL WORK OF PREPARING OUR COMMUNITIES NOW CAN'T WAIT ARBITRATE SYSTEMS WILL BE TESTED YET AGAIN THIS SUMMER AND TODAY WE HAVE A CHANCE TO SUPPORT THEM EARLY SO THOSE AND MANY OTHER REASONS I SUPPORT A. B. EIGHTY FIVE THANK U. S. B. THANK YOU MISS RODRIGUEZ. MR FRAZIER. YOUR ADDRESS. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER SO OBVIOUSLY I DO SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE I KIND OF AND- DID TEN BILLS ARE ON THE SUBJECT MATTER THIS YEAR AND WANTED TO BE PART OF THIS EQUATION THE IT ELLEN YOU FIRE WAS WITHIN A MILE AND A HALF OF MY HOUSE. AND WE INTEGRATED- ALL OF THE YOU KNOW- STAKEHOLDERS AND ALL OF THE- EXPERTS SO WE CAN DO OVER THE LAST SIX OR SEVEN MONTHS WITH MY STAFF. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS INVESTMENT IS VERY PRESCRIPTIVE IN HAS EXPECTED OUTCOMES ARE UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAVE BEEN DEFICIENT OR OUR DILIGENCE ON WILDFIRE COMING UP TO THIS POINT THE LAST THREE YEARS HAVE BEEN DEVASTATING NOT ONLY TO. THE ECONOMY BUT A LOSS OF LIFE AND PROPERTY DAMAGE I THINK THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IN THE LAST FIRE LOST ABOUT TEN BILLION DOLLARS WHEN. MY- ALI FROM SANTA MONICA SAID SAID. THE- YOU KNOW TEN NINE NINE BILLION IN LOSS OF ALSO SO IT ITS ONGOING IT HAS A MULTIPLYING AFFECTED MOST MOST PEOPLE ONE OF THE THINGS I'D LIKE TO BRING TO LIGHT THOUGH IS WHEN WE LOOK AT ALL OF THE EFFORTS NO MINE HAD A BIGGER COMPONENT OF GIGI R. F. OF. FUNDING AND THE REASON BEING IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NINETEENTH. OR THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN WILDFIRE THAT WE HAD. IT EMITTED SIXTY EIGHT MILLION METRIC TONS OF CARBON. OKAY THE CONTINUATION OF THE LAST THREE FIRES HAVE BEEN OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION METRIC TONS OF CARBON EMITTED. THAT IN ITSELF IS NEGATED EVERYTHING THE CARB IS DONE WITH THE G. G. R. UP FUND. THEY'VE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO ATTAIN AND IF IT'S A LOT OF WILL GO IN IS FANTASTIC THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO. BUT THEY'VE ONLY IT. BEEN ABLE TO. CAPTURE A LIMON A FORTY FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION METRIC TONS. FOR TWELVE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS. NOW AGAIN LAUDABLE GOALS BUT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO TAKE THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND PUT MORE PRIORITY ON WILDFIRE MITIGATION SUPPRESSION FORCED THE MANAGEMENT HOME HARDENING. AND GET AHEAD OF THIS WITH THE GOOD WORK THE CARD DOES CAN ACTUALLY MEANS SOMETHING AND ACTUALLY. BE SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY COUNTS THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS WE NEED TO. ROB FROM PETER TO PAY PAUL RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THIS IS A DEVASTATING EFFECT THAT HAS HAPPENED. I'M JUST HOPING THAT WE CAN GO FORWARD MAKE THIS IS A NATIONAL INVESTMENT THE REALIZE THAT WE HAVE TO CAPTURE. MORE CARBON THIS WAY SO THAT THE OTHER CAN BE AFFECTED THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS FRAZIER DOCTOR WHAT YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS AS THE MEMBER WHO'S THAT HAD- THREE OF THE FIVE LARGEST WILDFIRES IN THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA BURN IN MY DISTRICT I STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL TWO OF THOSE. FIRES WERE LAST YEAR. THIS DEAL INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT OPPOSE THE ANNUAL FUNDING COMMITMENT I REQUESTED ALONG WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER DOLLY AT THE TIME. THREE YEARS AGO IN SB NINE A ONE IT ALSO DEDICATES TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO HOOK FUND HOME HARDING EFFORTS IS LAID OUT IN MY BILL AB THIRTY EIGHT. WHICH WAS SIGNED TWO YEARS AGO AND IS LOCKED FUNDING TO THE STATE BUDGET CONSTRAINTS. THAT TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WILL ALLOW US TO SEEKS SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN MATCHING FEDERAL FUNDS FROM FEMA. THE DEAL ALSO INCLUDES FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS IN REFINING FOR REGIONAL FOREST AND FIRE CAPACITY PROGRAM IS DESIGNED IN MY BILL INTRODUCED THIS YEAR AB NINE. THE EARLY ACTION WILL HELP US GET CRITICAL FIRE PREVENTION WORK UNDERWAY BEFORE THE HEART OF THIS YEAR'S FIRE SEASON. PREVENTION AND PREPAREDNESS IS CRITICAL FOR BOTH STAVING LIVES AS AS WELL AS A SOUND FINANCIAL INVESTMENT. FEMA RESEARCH SHOWS THAT FOR EVERY DOLLAR SPENT ON PREVENTION WE SAVE SIX DOLLARS ON CLEAN UP AND REBUILDING. THE FIRE CRISES WE ARE WE ARE AND WE ARE IN TOOK GENERATIONS TO CORRECT CREATE IT WILL TAKE DECADES TO SOLVE THIS CANNOT END WE NEED ANOTHER BIG COMMITMENT OF RESOURCES IN THE JUNE BUDGET. WE'VE ALREADY LOST MONTHS OF POSSIBLE PREPARE PREPAREDNESS AND PREVENTION WORK. AND WE'RE HEADING INTO ANOTHER DROUGHT. WE NEED TO PREPARE BE PREPARING FOR FIRE SEASON LIKE WE ARE PREPARING FOR AN IMPENDING HURRICANE. JUST BECAUSE WE CAN'T SEE IT BEARING DOWN ON US LIKE A HURRICANE DOES. DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE STORM IS ANY LESS REAL AND THAT ISN'T COMING ONCE A FIRE STARTS IT'S TOO LATE. THAT PREPARATION WORK NEEDS TO BEGINNING AND START HAPPENING RIGHT NOW I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU DR WHAT IS WALDRON. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED AT YOUR DESK. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS ALL RIGHTS TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB EIGHTY FIVE AS WE KNOW THIS PAST YEAR WE'VE EXPERIENCED SOME OF THE LARGEST WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. THE REGION I REPRESENT EXPERIENCE TWO OF THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS THE CEDAR FIRE IN TWO THOUSAND THREE WHICH BURNED. OVER TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND ACRES. ALMOST THREE THOUSAND STRUCTURES WITH FIFTEEN DEATHS THE WHICH FIRE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. WITH ALMOST TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES BURNED AND SIXTEEN HUNDRED FIFTY STRUCTURES INTO THE- THESE NUMBERS THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY EXPERIENCE EXAMPLE BY THE WILDFIRES ARE DEFINITELY AN ISSUE. FOR THE ENTIRE STATE BOTH NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COMBINE. HELPING VICTIMS SHOULD OF COURSE BE OUR IMMEDIATE PRIORITY BUT WE MUST DEVELOP POLICIES THAT WILL PREVENT FUTURE MEGA FIRES. THE THREAT OF WILDFIRES IS STILL GROWING BY THE DAY IS MILLIONS OF DEAD TREES ARE FILLING OUR CARS WITH FUEL VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IS STILL LACKING. IT'S CERTAINLY COMMENDABLE WITH THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT PROVIDES FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX. MILLION IN EARLY ACTION WHILE FOR A FOREST RESILIENCE FUNDING TO ENSURE THAT LIES THE PROTECTIVE FROM THE FIRES THAT PLAGUE OUR STATE EVERY YEAR. ALTHOUGH I BELIEVE THAT WE AS THE LEGISLATURE TO FOCUS MORE ON PREVENTION ON FUEL REDUCTION. FOREST MANAGEMENT PROJECTS AND THE UNIQUE CHAPARRAL OAK WOODLANDS OF OUR SOUTHERN REGION THAT BEING SAID THIS BILL IS DEFINITELY A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION OF PREVENTING WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA- TO THE LEVEL. BIGHAM IS WALDRON MR GALLAGHER YOU'RE RECKONS. THANK YOU MEMBERS- I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB EIGHTY FIVE TODAY BUT IF WE THINK THAT THIS IS ENOUGH. TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS THAT WE ARE IN RIGHT NOW WHEN IT COMES TO CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE WE ARE FOOLING OURSELVES. AND WE EED TO TALK ABOUT THE HISTORY A LITTLE BIT HERE AND WHAT'S REALLY IN THIS BILL FIVE FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS GETS THROWN AROUND THAT'S A BIG NUMBER. IT'S GOOD TO TALK ABOUT THAT. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT'S IN THAT FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX MILLION A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION IS TO MEET THE OBLIGATION FROM LAST YEAR. OF THE S. B. NINE OH ONE COMPROMISE. WHICH MY COLLEAGUE FROM HEALDSBURG AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM BEAVER SUCCESSFULLY NEGOTIATED THREE YEARS AGO. BUT WE DID NOT PUT THAT MONEY IN LAST YEAR. SO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION OF THIS IS JUST KEEPING OUR COMMITMENT FROM LAST YEAR. THAT'S NOT NEW ADDITIONAL MONEY. ON THE TABLE TO ADDRESS THIS. THE NEW ADDITIONAL MONEY IN HERE IS ABOUT A HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS. OF GENERAL FUND MONEY TO DO WHAT I WOULD CALL. FUEL REDUCTION OF FORESTRY HEALTH PROJECTS THAT'S WHAT IT'S REALLY ABOUT IT'S REALLY ABOUT A HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION. NOT THAT THAT'S BAD BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH. I HAVE LEGISLATION THIS YEAR THAT WOULD DOUBLE. THAT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR COMMITMENT A YEAR WE SHOULD BE DOING THAT RIGHT NOW NEED TO DOUBLE DOWN NOW BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS ALREADY HONEST FIRES ARE HAPPENING NOW. COMMUNITIES ARE GETTING WIPED OUT NOW. PARADISE IN MY DISTRICT VERY CREEK IN MY COLLEAGUES DISTRICT. LAKE COUNTY IN MY COLLEAGUES IN MY COLLEAGUES DISTRICT FROM NAPA. FAR TOO MANY COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GETTING ON TOP OF THE FUEL REDUCTION. ISSUE THE ISSUE IS FUEL. WE HAVE TEN FOOT TALL PILES OF BRUSH AND SOME OF THESE AREAS IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE THIS PART COMES FROM. WHEREVER IT COMES FROM IT'S A CONFLAGRATION THAT OUR FIREFIGHTERS SAY. THEY CAN'T EVEN STOP IT ONCE IT STARTS IT BECOMES A LIFESAVING MISSION NOT A FIRE SUPPRESSION THAT MISSION. SO IF YOU'RE NOT GETTING ON TOP OF THE FUEL REDUCTION IF YOU'RE NOT DOING SOMETHING ABOUT FUEL YOU'RE NOT SOLVING THIS PROBLEM. SO HUNDRED EIGHTY HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION BUT THE REST OF IT IS A LOT OF SMOKE AND MIRRORS. AND LET'S FACE IT WE DON'T NEED ANYMORE SMOKE. IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE HAD MYCOLOGIST TALKED ABOUT THE CARBON EMISSIONS FROM THESE FIRES THEY- THEY COMPLETELY DWARF. THE REDUCTIONS THAT WE'VE MADE ON CARBON. AND STILL WE JUST. WELL DOWN ON THE MONEY. AND WE NEED TO REDUCE THE BUREAUCRATIC. RED TAPE THE GETS IN THE WAY OF DOING PROJECTS SEEK WAS A PROBLEM SYKORA STANDS IN THE WAY OF DOING THESE PROJECTS WE DID THIRTY FIVE UNDER THE GOVERNOR BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR. PUSH FOR STREAMLINED PROJECTS WE DID THIRTY FIVE OF THEM. WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY MORE ARE GOING TO BE DONE UNDER THIS BILL. THERE STILL HAS BEEN NO STREAMLINING THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. I HAVE LEGISLATION ON THAT FRONT. THAT I WOULD HOPE THAT THIS BODY WOULD PASS BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE THE MONEY. BUT YOU DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO MOVE FOR WITH THE PROJECT. WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED IN BERRY CREEK THIS YEAR. THEY HAD THE MONEY. PREPARE TO MOVE FOR THE PROJECT. AND HOW TO DO A FULL ANOTHER SEQUEL REVIEW AND IT. PUT THEM OUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS THE FIRE CAME THIS YEAR. IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING ABOUT STREAMLINING SEEK WERE. SO THAT WE CAN DO THESE PROJECTS AND WE CAN DO THEM TIMELY. AND THE WE CAN INCREASE THE PACE AND SCALE WE'RE NOT. SOLVING THE PROBLEM SO I HOPE THAT TODAY IS NOT JUST. HEY WE SOLVED IT PAT EACH OTHER ON THE BACK. IT'S PAST FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS OF EARLY ACTION AND WE'RE DONE. THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO STOP FIRES. LIKE THE ONES THAT HAVE DEVASTATED ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND WE'VE ALL BEEN IMPACTED ALL OF US TO GET HAVE EXPERIENCED. THE DECREASING CLEAN AIR AS A RESULT OF THESE FIRES. EVERY PART OF CALIFORNIA HAS SOME THREAT. FROM WILDFIRE THIRTY SECONDS. NINETY NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS BILL IS SET ASIDE TO STATE OWNED PROPERTY CONSERVANCY'S. TWELVE MILLION IS GOING TO THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY. FOLKS THAT'S MONEY THAT COULD BE DIRECTED INTO THE PROJECTS THAT ARE ACTUALLY REDUCING FUEL IN THE STATE AND HELPING PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES AND KEEPING OUR AIR CLEAN AND REDUCING CARBON EMISSIONS IN THE STATE WE NEED TO GET OUR PRIORITIES STRAIGHT. I'M VOTING FOR THIS TODAY BUT THIS SHOULD NOT BE THE END. WE SHOULD BE DOING A WHOLE LOT MORE MORE RESOURCES REMOVING MORE BARRIERS. TO GETTING THESE PROJECTS DONE AND I HOPE YOU WILL JOIN ME IN THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU RISK GALLAGHER MISTER C. R. TELL YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. SORRY I'M NOT GOING TO REITERATE A LOT OF THE POINTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE- I AM GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND I'M GOING TO SUPPORT IT. BECAUSE IT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING. AND THAT'S SAD FOR ME BECAUSE I DON'T USUALLY SUPPORT THINGS THAT ARE BETTER THAN NOTHING WHAT I SUPPORTER THINGS AT WORK. THINGS THAT ACTUALLY ARE GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE QUICKLY. AND THOSE EFFORTS NEED TO COME FROM. A BI PARTISAN EFFORT. AND WHAT I HAVE SEEN IN THIS BILL BUT A LOT OF MONEY THAT'S SPENT ON THINGS THAT ARE NOT PART OF WILDFIRE SUPPRESSION THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND FOR FROM ONE OF THOSE PERSONS WHO HAS ACTUALLY BEEN IN THOSE FIRES AS OPPOSED TO WATCHING THEM ON TV. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE SITUATION IS NOT GOING TO GET BETTER BY SPENDING THIS MONEY ON IT AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE SOLVED ON APRIL TWELFTH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE IN THE LEGISLATURE WE NEED TO KEEP WORKING ON THIS I WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH PEOPLE ON LEGISLATION THAT MAKES SENSE IT WILL ACTUALLY REMOVE THE BARRIERS THAT WE HAVE THAT ARE PREVENTING US FROM DOING WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO PROTECT. OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR HOMES AND OUR PEOPLE'S LIVES. SO I WILL VOTE FOR THIS TODAY. BUT I JUST WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT THE ANSWER WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS THANK YOU.

CORKERY SENATE BILL NINETY THREE BY THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON BUDGET AND FISCAL REVIEW AN ACT RELATING TO EMPLOYMENT MAKING APPROPRIATION OR FORCE TAKE AFFECT IMMEDIATELY BE RELATED TO THE BUDGET. MISTER TECH. YOU MISTER CHAIR SB NINETY THREE IS A BILL TO REALLY AID. WORKERS WHO WERE SOME OF THE HARDEST HIT IN THE TIRE STATE. HOSPITALITY WORKERS WERE LAID OFF AS HOTELS ACROSS THE CLOSING FRANKLY HAVEN'T MANY HAVEN'T EVEN. WE OPENED UP DURING THIS VERY VERY CHALLENGING YEAR. TO PROVIDE THESE VULNERABLE WORKERS THE RIGHT TO RETURN TO WORK IF THEY WERE LAID OFF DURING THE PANDEMIC. THE BILL BUILT ON. THE LEGISLATURE FROM OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN JOSE AB THIRTY TWO SIXTEEN. BUT WAS AMENDED TO PROVIDE AGREEMENT UNFORTUNATELY THAT THAT BILL WASN'T SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR LAST YEAR. BUT THERE WAS SIX MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS PUT INTO THE BUDGET FOR ENFORCEMENT OF LABOR ACTIONS. OF DUTERTE. INDUSTRIES ARE MOST IMPACTED BY COPING. SO WELL THERE WAS MONEY IN THE BUDGET UNFORTUNATELY THERE WAS A POLICY THAT WAS EITHER IN THE BUDGET OR PASSED BY THIS LEGISLATURE WERE SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. THAT ALLOWED US TO FURTHER CLARIFY SPECIFICALLY HOW WE SHOULD ASSIST. HOSPITALITY WORKERS OF THIS BILL HAS A NUMBER OF PROVISIONS THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM AB THIRTY TWO SIXTEEN OF PROVIDES NO PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. IT LIMITS THE RE HIRING RIGHTS TO EMPLOYEES IMPACTED BY COVERT NINETEEN. IT CONTAINS A SUNSET PROVISION FOR TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. SO AGAIN OF THE ENFORCEABLE WILL BE DONE BY THE LABOR AGENCY VERSUS A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION SO. THOSE CHANGES WERE MADE FROM EVEN A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT PASSED THIS BODY PASSED BOTH BODIES GOT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK. THE WE COULD ABLE TO REACH AGREEMENT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. THIS BILL ALSO INCLUDES SIX MILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING. SO THAT WE CAN INSURE THAT THERE'S PROPER ENFORCEMENT OF THIS LEGISLATION WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY. ASK FOR AYE VOTE FOR SB NINETY THREE. THANK YOU MICHELLE MR FONG. A YOU MISTER SPEAKER. MEMBERS I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO SB NINETY THREE WE ALL KNOW OUR SMALL BUSINESS ARE SUFFERING RIGHT NOW ESPECIALLY THOSE AND OUR HOSPITALITY SPACE BUT WITH MORE MANDATES AND REQUIREMENTS I RECOVERY WILL SLOW. INSPIRING STORIES OF BUSINESS OWNERS FIGHTING AGAINST ALL ODDS DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO KEEP EMPLOYEES HIRED HAVE UNDOUBTEDLY REACH ALL OF US GET INSTEAD OF THE INSPIRATION THEY'VE OFFERED US THIS LEGISLATURE NOW WANTS TO FORCE EMPLOYERS TO OVERRIDE THE VERY PRACTICES THEY'VE USED TO KEEP THEIR DOORS OPEN. WE SHOULD NOT. BE IMPOSING NEW REQUIREMENTS OF BUSINESSES OR EXPOSING THEM TO EVEN MORE LIABILITY WHICH- OBSTRUCTED EVERY HIRING AND RECOVERY. THIS BILL WORKS AGAINST MOMENTUM SMALL BUSINESSES NEED TO HELP THEM HIGHER TO GET PEOPLE OFF ON OF WOMEN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE I URGE A NO VOTE ON SB NINETY THREE. THANK YOU MEMBERS THIS RUBIO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE TODAY WITH CONCERNS ABOUT SB NINETY THREE A POLICY BILL WHICH IS BEING HEARD TODAY AS AN URGENT TRAILER BILL FIRST ON THE MERITS OF THE POLICY IT IS CLEAR THAT THE BILL IS BEING PRETTY MUCH CERTAIN PREMATURELY RUSHED. OUT ONE OF THE ATTEMPTED JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS POLICY BEING INVITED TRAILER IS THAT WE SPENT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN A BUDGET TRAILER BILL LAST YEAR AND SB NINETY THREE IMPLEMENTS THE POLICY ATTACHED TO THE PREVIOUS BUDGET ACTION I WAS IN-COMMITTEE EARLIER TODAY AND ASKED SEVERAL QUESTIONS AND THOSE QUESTIONS WERE NOT ANSWERED BY THE BUDGET. STAFF WHICH AGAIN WORRIES ME ABOUT BY THE POLICY ASPECT OF THIS BILL. HOWEVER AND I'M SORRY DURING THIS HEARING THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WAS UNABLE TO ANSWER WHAT HAPPENED TO THE ORIGINAL SIX MILLION DOLLARS FROM LAST YEAR AFTER I REPEATEDLY ASKED. I WAS GIVEN DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF IT. I HAD ALREADY SPOKEN TO THE- MR TING ABOUT THIS AND WANTED TO JUST REITERATE THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO BE SPENDING TIME IN THE BUDGET HEARING. AND BAD THE BUDGET- THE BUDGET STAFF NEEDS TO BE PREPARED TO ANSWER ALL QUESTIONS ESPECIALLY IF WE ARE ONLY GIVEN AN HOUR TO STAND HERE BEFORE. THE BILL IS PRESENTED TO US TO BE VOTED UPON. EARLIER IT WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THAT THE SIX MILLION DOLLARS FROM OUR LAST YEAR HAVE ALREADY BEEN SPENT BUT- AGAIN COULD NOT BAD. STOP COULD NOT ANSWER WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE SIX MILLION DOLLARS. WE HAVE A POLICY COULD MERIT COMMITTEE PROCESS FOR THIS REASON AND THE REASON IS THAT ISSUES AND POLICY CAN BE WORKED OUT WITH INPUT FROM THE COMMITTEE CHAIRS AND THE PUBLIC. THIS MEASURE TODAY IN FRONT OF US IN MY OPINION IT'S GOING UP WITHOUT PROPER OVERSIGHT I CAN'T ANSWER TO MY CONSTITUENTS AS TO WHY I AM GOING TO BE VOTING FOR A BILL. THAT THEY CANNOT DISCUSS WITH ME. WHEN FOR THE FOLKS IN CHARGE OF WRITING LEGISLATION CAN'T ANSWER THE BASIC QUESTIONS AND COMMITTEE MAKES ME WONDER HOW THIS IS READY TO BE SENT TO THE GOVERNOR AND FIND TODAY. I'M NOT SAYING THAT IT IS NOT APPROPRIATE TO BRING THIS BILL UP I'M JUST SAYING THAT WE NEED MORE TIME TO PROPERLY VET THIS BILL. YOU THE RESULTS WILL PROBABLY BE THE SAME BUT I SEE NO REASON FOR IT TO BE UP TODAY AS OPPOSED TO THURSDAY WHEN WE HAVE ANOTHER. OB FLOOR SESSION. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BUT AGAIN I WOULD. ASK RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT WHEN BUDGET. ISSUES COME UP THE PLEASE DO NOT GIVE US MORE THAN TWO HOURS TO DISCUSS THE BILL. AND THEN EXPECT US TO STAND IN FRONT OF YOU AND VOTE ON THESE BILLS THANK YOU. THANK OF ISRAEL MISTER FLORES. ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO U. S. B. NINETY THREE A FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS- I STAND HERE. QUITE FRANKLY WITH LITTLE BIT OF DEJA VU. WE SAW THIRTY TWO SIXTEEN AND LABOR COMMITTEE LAST YEAR. THEY BARELY GOT OUT WITH ALL THIRTY TWO SIXTEEN ON THIS FLOOR LAST YEAR. AND I GOT OUT WITH FORTY SIX VOTES WENT OVER TO THE SENATE CAME BACK. THEY GOT OUT WITH FORTY FOUR VOTES. THERE IS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF OPPOSITION. TO THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THE BUDGET CHAIR IN HIS COMMENTS AT THE BEGINNING. MENTIONED THAT THIS WAS A POLICY. THERE WAS MONEY IN THE BUDGET BUT THE POLICY WASN'T THERE ADMITTING. THIS IS A POLICY BILL. WE HAVE NOT RAN THIS BILL THROUGH POLICY THIS YEAR. THIS BILL HAS AN EMERGENCY CLAUSE ON IT'LL GO AFFECTED ME DEEPLY. BUT BECAUSE WE'RE USING THE BUDGET PROCESS. WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT WE GET THAT WITH A SIMPLE MAJORITY. FRIENDS THIS IS INCREDIBLY PROBLEMATIC. EMPLOYEES HAVE THE RIGHT TO GET REHIRED AND MOST EMPLOYERS. WILL ABSOLUTELY CALL THEM FIRST BECAUSE THEY'RE TRAINED. IT'S IN THEIR BENEFIT TO HIRE PEOPLE THAT OF THEY'VE ALREADY EMPLOYED BUT TO PUT THE BURDEN. TO PUT THE FEES. THE FINES THE LIABILITY ON THE EMPLOYEE ON EMPLOYERS RATHER. IT'S UNACCEPTABLE SO YOU HAVE AN EMPLOYEE. THAT DOESN'T RESPOND TO YOU FOR A COUPLE WEEKS. AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN- LET'S JUST SAY TEN DAYS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S TWO WEEKS OF THE OF THE OPPORTUNITY RESPOND. YOU'RE GOING TO BE ON THE HOOK FOR FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A DAY. IN FEES TO THAT EMPLOYEE PLUS WHATEVER LITIGATION COMES AFTER THAT. THE AMOUNT OF BURDEN. ON THE BUSINESS TO ME THAT THIS WILL IMPOSE. IS TREMENDOUS. COLLEAGUES I WILL JUST SAY THIS ONE MORE TIME. THE GOVERNOR VETOED. THIRTY TWO SIXTEEN LAST YEAR FOR A LOT OF THESE ISSUES AND I KNOW POPULOUS TAKEN OUT OF IT BUT IT'S STILL BE ENFORCEMENT FOR LABOR. STILL HASN'T ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM IN THIS BILL. THIS IS NOT A BUDGET BILL. THIS IS A POLICY BILL THAT SHOULD HAVE GONE THROUGH POLICY COMMITTEE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUT HERE WE ARE TODAY- IN BUDGET I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE US TO. JUST NOT OVER THIS BILL RUN IT THROUGH POLICY AND HAVE THE ACTUAL DISCUSSIONS THE NEED TO BE HAD BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DISCUSSED OCT TO MAKE THIS BILL UNWORKABLE AND IN BUDGET THISIS NOT THE TIME. OR THE PLACE AND QUITE FRANKLY. IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF USE OF THE INSTITUTION. THIS RIGHT HERE IS A BAD PRECEDENT TO SET. WHEN YOU GET A POLICY THAT IS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR YOU MAKE SUBTLE CHANGES AND RUN IT AS A BUDGET PLAY. WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE QUALITIES I RESPECTFULLY ASK REMOVAL. THERE IS FOR MISTER KALRA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER OF AN HOUR I WANT TO THANK- A COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO AS WELL AS OUR BUDGET SHARE IN OUR SPEAKER- FOR WORKING WITH- SENATE COLLEAGUES AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN RESOLVING THE ISSUES ARE OUTSTANDING. AT THE END OF THE SESSION LAST YEAR AS WE WERE JUST REMINDED OF THIS POLICY IS ALREADY BEEN VOTED AND SUPPORTED BY A MAJORITY SEVERAL TIMES ON THIS FLOOR AND BY THIS BODY. AS OF THIS IS NOT A POLICY THAT THAT THAT THAT- THAT OUR BODY IS NOT SUPPORTING FACTORS SHOWN OVERWHELMING SUPPORT TIME AND AGAIN THE ISSUE WAS AS MENTIONED- THE GOVERNOR'S VETO. AND SOLVE THIS RESOLVES THE ISSUES- OF THE ENVIRONMENT- THROUGH COLLABORATIVE SPIRIT. THERE'S BEEN AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD. AND I WOULD SAY THAT. THIS IS ACTUALLY A MORE NARROW VERSION OF WHAT THIS BODY HAS ALREADY VOTED FOR SEVERAL TIMES SO THE POLICY AND THE SUPPORT OF THAT THIS BODY SUPPORT OF THE POLICY. IS NOT AND HAS NOT BEEN IN QUESTION I WAS SAID NOT ONLY IS JUST NOT RUSHED. BUT JUSTICE IS JUSTICE FOR THESE WORKERS HAS BEEN DELAYED FOR WELL OVER SIX MONTHS. AND SO IT'S THESE WORKERS THAT ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN SUFFERING AND STRUGGLING AND USE THESE WORKERS THAT ARE JUST BEING GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO BACK TO THE JOBS THEY ALREADY HAVE. THESE EMPLOYERS ALREADY EMPLOYED THEM PUT THEM IN THESE POSITIONS. SO THIS IS NOT US TELLING THEM TO HIRE FOLKS THEY DON'T LIKE OR DON'T WANT. WE'RE JUST ASKING OPPORTUNITY FOR THESE WORKERS TO BE ABLE TO GO BACK TO THEIR PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT. OUR AND WE HAVE A RESOLUTION NOW. THAT NOT ONLY. SUPPORTS THE POLICY AGAIN THAT THIS BODY HAS SUPPORTED TIME AND AGAIN BUT ALSO HAS A RESOLUTION WITH THE GOVERNOR AND TO RESOLVE THE ISSUES REGARDING THE VETO. THANK YOU. THANKS CALMEST GALLAGHER YES I WOULD JUST ADD WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN JOSE'S SAYS THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT POLICY THEN YOU CAN GO THROUGH THE POLICY COMMITTEES AS IT DID LAST TIME INSTEAD OF BEING FAST TRACKED WITH ABUNDANT TIME TWO HOURS. TO REVIEW THE LANGUAGE AND THEN BE ABLE TO COME IN AND VOTE ON THIS THAT'S CLEARLY NOT. HOW WE SHOULD DO BUSINESS IN THIS HOUSE BUT THE OTHER THING I WOULD ADD THAT HASN'T BEEN SAID IN THIS DEBATE. IS THE GROSS INCONSISTENCY. THERE WERE FAST TRACKING THIS POLICY WELL THE BIGGEST THING FACING BUSINESSES EVERY BUSINESS IN THE STATE. IS PPP TAX CONFORMITY AND WE HAVE THE U. S. TREASURY COME OUT LAST WEEK SAYING THAT YES YOU CAN MOVE FORWARD. THIS WILL NOT AFFECT. YOUR STIMULUS MONEY AND YET THAT WHERE'S THAT BILL. WHERE'S THAT BILL GETTING PUSH FOR THE BIGGEST THING AFFECTED AND WANTED PPP DO BY THE WAY. IT HELP THOSE EMPLOYERS PAY THEIR EMPLOYEES DURING COVED AND KEEP IMPORTANT KEEP EMPLOYEES ON. BUT THERE'S NO URGENCY ON THIS BODY TO BRING THAT BILL TO THIS FLOOR AND INSTEAD WERE FAST TRACKING THIS POLICY. OUR PRIORITIES ARE OFF I THINK I MEAN LOOK WE NEED TO BE DOING THE RIGHT THNGS WE NEED TO BE FOLLOWING THE RIGHT PART PROCESS. AND WE NEED TO DO RIGHT BY ALL PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT. MS GONZALEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I TRY TO WRITE DOWN SOME OF THE THINGS WERE SAID BECAUSE I WANT PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING THE TIMELINE OF HOW WE GOT HERE I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY QUITE IMPORTANT. NUMBER ONE YES THIS WAS PASSED OFF A TOUGHER MORE CONSTRICTED VERSION WAS PASSED OFF WITH THIS FLOOR TWICE IN OFF THE SENATE FLOOR LAST YEAR. THE GOVERNOR VETOED THAT LANGUAGE AND SAID THESE ARE THE CHANGES THAT NEED TO HAPPEN WE IMMEDIATELY WENT TO MAKING THOSE CHANGES THOSE WERE THE CHANGES THAT WERE ASKED FOR BY THE INDUSTRY AT THE TIME OF COURSE THEY COME BACK THEY HAVE NEW REQUEST BUT THAT'S WHAT WHAT WE DID. THIS IS FAST TRACKED. BECAUSE OPENING IS FAST TRACKED AS SOON AS THE GOVERNOR SAID DISNEYLAND CAN OPEN IT DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY HOTELS AROUND DISNEYLAND DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY OTHER THINGS WILL BE OPEN BECAUSE DISNEYLAND IS OPEN THERE IS A NEED TO ENSURE AS WE OPEN UP THAT WORKERS ARE MADE WHOLE IN WHO ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR. THE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN. AT THE HEIGHT. OF A FEELING THE EFFECTS OF THIS PANDEMIC NOT JUST LATINOS BUT IN PARTICULAR LATINAS WE WENT INTO THIS PANDEMIC WITH LATINOS MAKING. FORTY FOUR CENTS ON THE DOLLAR THE WHITE MALE COUNTERPART. AND WE'RE ALREADY DEALING WITH THAT REALITY. THEN WE ENDED UP HAVING LATINAS LOSE THEIR JOBS AT A RATE ASTRONOMICAL COMPARED TO ANY OTHER GROUP IN WHY IS THAT WHO ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LATINO SERVICE WORKERS. OLDER MEDINA SERVICE WORKERS I AM SO TIRED OF PEOPLE STANDING UP IT'S SEEN THEY THEY SUPPORT THE LATINO COMMUNITY BUT WHEN IT COMES TO AT ADDRESSING A SPECIFIC NEED FOR OUR COMMUNITY LOOKING THE OTHER WAY AND SEEN WHAT ABOUT THE EMPLOYERS WHAT ABOUT THE SMALL BUSINESSES WELL. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THERE ARE NO SMALL BUSINESSES IN HERE IT ONLY APPLIES TO HOTELS WITH OVER FIFTY ROOMS EVENT CENTERS WITH OVER A THOUSAND SEATS IN AIRPORTS THESE ARE NOT YOUR MOM AND POP BUSINESSES THESE ARE COMPANIES THAT ACTUALLY CAN DO THIS AND HAVE BEEN DOING IT IF THEY'RE UNDER UNION CONTRACT. THIS IS FOR NON UNION WORKERS WHO DON'T HAVE THE PROTECTIONS THAT ARE UNION WORKERS ENJOY WITH A UNION CONTRACT AND THAT'S ENSURING THAT WOMEN ARE BROUGHT BACK TO CLEAN YOUR HOTEL ROOM. IF THEY'VE BEEN THERE A LONG IF THEY PUT THE MOST INTO THE COMPANY THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE OFFERED THEIR JOB NOT FOR TWO WEEKS LIKE WAS SAID THEY GET FIVE DAYS TO RESPOND WHY FIVE DAYS A LOT OF **** EXCUSE MY LANGUAGE A LOT OF STUFF HAS HAPPENED DURING THIS PANDEMIC. PEOPLE HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES PEOPLE HAVE MOVED PEOPLE HAD TO MOVE IN WITH EACH OTHER AND GETTING THE ACTUAL NOTICE MAY TAKE A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN NORMAL FIVE DAYS IS NOT UNREASONABLE THERE CITIES WHO ARE DOING THAT NOW. BUT SIX MILLION DOLLARS THE LATINO CAUCUS FOUGHT HARD TO GET SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO DR LAST YEAR DURING THE BUDGET PROCESS THAT WAS FOR THIS BILL AND SOME OTHER A LABOR PROTECTIONS AND THEN THE GOVERNOR VETOED THIS BILL. WE WENT BACK WE FIX WHAT THE INDUSTRY IN THE GOVERNOR HAD COMPLAINED ABOUT BUT GUESS WHAT NO PAGA. NO PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IT'S INCREDIBLE TO BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF THE POSITION NOW. OF OUR COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE IS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE NO ENFORCEMENT OF LABOR LAWS IF WE DON'T GIVE SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE LABOR COMMISSIONER TO ENFORCE. THOSE WHAT ARE WE DOING WE'RE HAVING. EMIGRE HOW. GO IN AND MAKE A DEMAND THAT BE SO. BY BY A LEGAL CASE BY. THE LABOR COMMISSIONER I MEAN I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW WE ENFORCE LABOR LAWS IF WE DON'T DO ONE OF THESE THINGS. I'VE HEARD THE CHAMBER SAY FOR YEARS. NO PROGRESS NO PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION JUST FUND THE LABOR COMMISSIONER WELL THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE. WE'RE GIVING THEM THE ABILITY TO MAKE. DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER THIS WAS VIOLATED I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE WE ENFORCE IT WE'RE GONNA WRITE TICKETS I DON'T KNOW YOU WANT TO BE IN THE PUBLIC SAFETY CODE I DON'T THINK ANYONE WANTS THAT. SO JUST TO BE SURE. WHAT WE ARE DOING IS NECESSARY TODAY. YES THAT MONEY WAS IN YES WE WERE HOPEFUL FOR THE POLICY THAT ALREADY PASSED THROUGH THIS CHAMBER LAST YEAR. WE HAVE NARROWLY TAILORED IT WE DID THE HARD WORK. THERE ARE COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE. WHO ARE OVERLY DEPENDENT ON THE SERVICE SECTOR THAT ARE SUFFERING. THEY DON'T KNOW IF AS WE RE OPEN THEY'RE GOING TO GET HER JOB BACK. THEY DON'T KNOW THIS WILL TELL THEM YES BY SENIORITY YOU WILL. HOLD TIGHT. KEEP YOUR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. JUST WAIT FOR THAT NOTICE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE I'M IN THE BUSINESS OF TRYING TO FIX THINGS FOR MY CONSTITUENTS. I HOPE ALL OF YOU ARE TOO AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NIGHT BUT- THANK YOU MISS GONZALEZ. MISTER BENNETT YOU ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR OF% THE CHAMBER THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL- AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO POINT ONE THING OUT AND THAT IS IF YOU LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE AND THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF SPECIFICS ABOUT THIS BILL AND HOW NARROWLY FOCUS IT IS ACCEPTABLE IF YOU LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE. WHEN CO WOULD HIT. WE TURN TO. THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY MORE THAN ANY PLACE ELSE AND SAID YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE PAIN. AND TREMENDOUS PAIN WAS INFLICTED UPON OF THE WORKERS AND THE BUSINESSES IN THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY AND IF WE ASKED A SOCIETY RESET MOST OF THE PAIN OUR CERTAINLY A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PAIN IS GOING TO BE- INFLICTED ON THIS INDUSTRY AND THE WORKERS IN THAT INDUSTRY OF THE ONES THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE TRY TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO GET THEM BACK WHOLE SINCE WE ASK THEM TO SACRIFICE FOR COVERT I KNOW THERE ARE MANY OTHER DETAILS BUT I KNOW THAT THAT'S AT LEAST ONE POINT. I THINK WE SHOULD EMPHASIZE AND THAT IS OF THE WORKERS THAT WE ASKED TO SACRIFICE THE MOST OF THE WORKERS THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TRIED TO MAKE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO MICHAEL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK WITH BETTER MISTER MURATSUCHI. YOUR RECOGNITION THANK YOU VERY MUCH I JUST WANT TO. REYES MY STANDING CONCERNED THAT- YOU KNOW WHILE I SUPPORT WORKERS WHILE I SUPPORT THE POLICY I VOTED FOR THE BILL LAST YEAR YOU KNOW I CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS WHEN WE BLUR THE LINES BETWEEN YOU KNOW THE POLICY PROCESS VERSUS THE BUDGET PROCESS. I WANT TO RAISE MY STANDING OBJECTION TO THE ABUSE OF THE BUDGET PROCESS AND RAISING POLICY ISSUES THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS. THANK YOU MISTERMURATSUCHI SAYING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION ON THE ITEM. MISTER KING YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. SO LET'S LET'S GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN. THIS WAS LEGISLATION THAT WAS INTRODUCED. TO HELP OF GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO WERE DESPERATELY IN NEED OF HELP. PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T HAD A PICTURE. FOR QUITE AWHILE. AND I THINK IF YOU ASKED ANY OF THEM. AND SAID HEY DO YOU WANT US TO GO THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS OR POLICY PROCESS. BECAUSE WE CAN'T GET YOUR JOB BACK. LET'S GUESS WHAT THAT'S THE- YOU HAVEN'T DONE YOUR JOB. IF YOU HAVE THE ABILITY. TO HELP US YOU ASKED US. COULD NOT GO TO WORK. YOU ASKED US TO STAY HOME. AND THIS LEGISLATION IS NOT NEW. WE HAVE A YEAR TO THE BETA WHY IS IT IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS IS ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE LAID OFF BECAUSE OF. THEY NEED HELP TODAY THEY ACTUALLY NEEDED HELP LAST YEAR WE SHOULD HAVE GOT THIS DONE LAST YEAR. BUT WHATEVER REASON IT DIDN'T AND THIS IS THE TIME TO MAKE IT RIGHT. THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE HAVE A GROUP OF WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN UNEMPLOYED UNEMPLOYMENT HOPEFULLY ON UNEMPLOYMENT BECAUSE WE DON'T HELD WELL THAT'S BEEN GOING. WE DON'T EVEN HAVE THE MAYBE THEY HAVEN'T EVEN BEGIN THE TRUCKS. BUT IF WE CAN HELP AS WE RE OPEN HELP THEM GET THEIR JOB BACK WITH THEIR EMPLOYER. IN A WAY THAT'S REASONABLE IN A WAY THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO AGAIN. HAVE A GOVERNMENT AGENCY PROVIDE. A CHECK AGAINST OF THE MEASURE THAT THIS BILL GETS IMPLEMENTED. WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE DO BILLS WITH THERE'S NO ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM WHEN THERE'S NOBODY WATCHING IT'S SELECTIVELY. IMPLEMENTED SO AGAIN. THESE ARE AGAIN LOW WAGE WORKERS THESE ARE NOT PEOPLE WHO GET PAID A LOT OF MONEY THESE ARE FOLKS WHO ARE ABLE TO SOCK AWAY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO HAVE WHETHER THIS LAST YEAR. AND AGAIN. I'LL I UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENT WE DIDN'T HEAR THAT ARGUMENT WE DISTILLED DIVISION PROPOSAL WE DIDN'T HEAR THAT ARGUMENT WILL WE JUST DID THE RTC EXPANSION ALL THESE ISSUES THAT WE HAD TO GO DO BECAUSE- WE'RE INDEPENDENT. SO AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE DEBATE I APPRECIATE THE FEEDBACK THIS LEGISLATION IS NOT SOMETHING HIS BODY HASN'T SEEN. THIS IS NOT NEW SO FOR THE FEW NEW MEMBERS WHO ARE HERE. AGAIN LET'S DO SOMETHING FOR THIS GROUP OF WORKERS WHO'VE BEEN SUFFERING FOR NOW OVER A YEAR. AND LET'S HELP THEM TODAY THANK YOU TECHNISCH CHAIN WITHOUT THE CLERK WILL OVER THE ROLE MEMBERS. THE DESIRE TO VOTE ALL MEMBERS VOTER DESIRE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS OF A RESERVE VOTE. ALL MEMBERS HEADED IS AT ABOUT. ALL MEMBERS VOTERS OUT OF A. ALL MY RICHARD IS OUT OF A. THE CLERK WILL CLOSE ROLL TIDE OF. HIGHS FIFTY ONE KNOWS NINETEEN THAT MEASURE PASSES. PARIS ARE MOVING TO ASSEMBLY THIRD READING. FILE ITEMS TWENTY ONE THREE TWENTY THREE PASS AND RETAIN. THIS IS FILE ITEM. TWENTY FOUR. AB FIVE ZERO THREE BY MR STONE. CORRECT ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE OH THREE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER STONE AND OTHERS AN ACT RELATING TO JUVENILES MR STONE EMAIL BUT THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS SB FIVE OH THREE IS A STRAIGHTFORWARD AND RESEARCH BASED. PROPOSAL THAT WOULD CHANGE HOW WE DEAL WITH YOU WHO ARE ON PROBATION RIGHT NOW IT DEPENDS THE WAY TOO MUCH ON THE ZIP CODE OF YOU AND THE COLOR FOR YOU. TO DICTATE THE TERMS THAT THEY'RE GETTING ON PROBATION IN SOME COUNTIES. YOU SPEND AN AVERAGE OF SIX MONTHS ON PROBATION AND OTHERS TWO AND A HALF YEARS AND THE NUMBER OF CONDITIONS THAT ARE PUT ON YOUTH CAN VARY WIDELY BASED ON THE COUNTY AND BASED ON THE RACE UPWARDS OF FIFTY. CONDITIONS THAT IN A WAY ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT THAT YOU CANNOT SUCCEED AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE IN THE CYCLE OF BEING PUT BACK ON PROBATION OR EVEN. INCARCERATED FOR VIOLATING PROBATION CONDITIONS. FOR SOME VERY VERY MINOR OFFENSES THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS BILL WITH THE PROBATION CHIEFS. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE THE ONES WHO ARE GOING TO HAVE TO IMPLEMENT THIS AND TO MAKE SURE THAT IT MEETS ALTERNATELY THEIR STANDARDS AND WHAT IT REALLY DOES IS TWO THINGS. ONE IS IT TAYLOR SAID THE PROBATION CONDITIONS TO THE NEEDS OF THE YOUTH AND THE CERTAIN THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES. SO MORE CONDITIONS IF IT'S A MORE SERIOUS CRIME. LET FEWER CONDITIONS IF IT'S NOT SUCH A SERIOUS CRIME AND IT ESTABLISHES A SIX MONTH TIMELINE SO THAT A KID NEEDS TO HAVE THEIR CASE REVIEWED. EVERY SIX MONTHS SO THEY DON'T JUST LANGUISH ON PROBATION WITHOUT ANY OPPORTUNITY TO GET OFF. CAN THIS IS RESEARCH BASED. THIS IS TO ADDRESS THE DISPARITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND ENSURE THAT WE ARE GETTING KIDS THROUGH THE PROBATION PROCESS. ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT THEY NEED TO ADDRESS BEFORE THEY COME BACK INTO OUR SOCIETY COME BACK IN OUR SOCIETY GO TO SCHOOL GO TO JOBS. THIS IS FOR. NONCUSTODIAL WARDS ONLY NAKISKA YOU AWARDS NOT THOSE ARE WHO ARE N. THE END JUVENILE HALLS OR- IN THE STATE'S SYSTEM BUT NONCUSTODIAL WORDS ONLY AND I ASK FOR YOUR ITEMS. TAKING DOWN. SENIOR DISCUSSION DEBATE ON THE I DON'T SORRY I MISSED COOPER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR YOU CAN DEFINE FOR THE MEMBERSHIP. LEVELS FROM CLEAR ON CUSTODIAL VERSUS NON CUSTODIAL WARD WELL MEMBERS DON'T ARE FAMILIAR WITH THAT TERM. WITHOUT OBJECTION SURE RIGHT AND I COULD STILL BE WARD IS ONE THAT IS AS I JUST SAID IS NOT IN JUVENILE HALL OR NOT IN THE STATE JUVENILE SYSTEM THAT THEY ARE IN THE COMMUNITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT. SO A. B. FIVE OH THREE TREES OFFICE IS THE SAME WITH THIS ROBBERY RAPE ANY TYPE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT OR MANSLAUGHTER THE MOST COURTS CAN DO THE WHOPPING SIX MONTHS PROBATION IN THE SIX MORE MONTHS WILL DETERMINE ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS IS WARRANTED THE BILL STATES THAT THE EXTENSION MUST BE FOR CLEAR. AND CONVINCING SETTING UNREASONABLE STANDARD AND NOT EVEN DEFINING WHAT THAT MEANS WHERE IN OUR SYSTEM DO WE HAVE A CLEAR AND CONVINCING STANDARD NOT THE PENAL CODE NOT ANY JUSTICE SYSTEM- THIS TOTALLY DISCOUNTS THE VICTIM'S WELFARE AND THE WELFARE STATE TO THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE. IF THE CONVICTION IS ANY TYPE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT OR VIOLENT CRIME. EVEN WITH MULTIPLE VICTIMS THEIR DISCOUNTED AND IGNORED THIS BILL. THE BILL ALSO LIMITS HOW MUCH TIME THE COURTS CAN GIVE A JUVENILE UNDER SEVENTEEN NO MATTER THE CRIME. UNDER THIS BILL A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD CAN ONLY RECEIVE THE MIDDLE TERM. OF AN ADULT FOR THE SAME OFFENSE I'M GONNA SAY THAT AGAIN FOR MY pSEVENTEEN YEAR OLD CAN ONLY RECEIVE THE MIDDLE TERM. OF AN ADULT FOR THE SAME OFFENSE. FOR THE SANDARD FOR THE OBVIOUSLY THE MID OFFENSE BASE OFFENSE IF YOU KILL SOMEONE YOUR JUVENILE FOR YEARS. IF YOU ROB SOMEBODY TWO YEARS RAPE SOMEBODY THREE YEARS THAT'S THE MID TERM OF THE BASE. A LOT OF FOLKS IF YOU'RE IN JUVENILE HALL YOU'RE IN NOT THE STORY WOULD BE A GROUP HOME IT'S A LOT OF KIDS ARE IN GROUP HOMES A LOT OF MEMBERS HAVE GROUP HOMES THEIR DISTRICT. FOR SEX OFFENDERS JUVENILE SEX OFFENDERS WITH THAT. SO THE THING IS. TODAY CURRENTLY IN OUR PRISON SYSTEM. YOU CAN GET INFORMATION BY THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT BE GIVEN SIX MONTHS. MAKING EXTENDED SIX MONTHS WITH THE COURT'S PERMISSION THAT'S AVAILABLE TODAY TO US. THE COURT CAN GRANT INFORMAL PROBATION AND GRANTS SIX MONTHS AND EXTEND THEMSELVES. MAY ALSO HAVE DEFERRED ENTRY OF JUDGMENT. WHICH IF THE PERSON DOES EVERYTHING IT IT TERMINATES AFTER YEAR. BUT THE PROBLEM IS IF THEY'RE GOING THROUGH THIS WHAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH ANGER REGRESSION. THINKING FOR A CHANGE. SUBSTANCE ABUSE. SIX WEALTHY ARE DONE IN SIX. THE COURT CAN KICK THEM SO. THERE'S A LOT OF MOVING PARTS THIS WITH A LOT FOR REFORMS. A LOT FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND LAW FOR MINORS DJJ IS GOING AWAY. WE SUPPORT ON THAT BILL A LITTLE WHILE AGO. AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLDS. IN JUVENILE HALL WALKING AROUND TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD GROWN MAN. YOU HAVE THAT EVENTUALLY IT WOULD AND THAT'S HOW IT IS. SO THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS SO THERE'S A LOT OF MOVING PARTS TO THIS WELL IT SOUNDS GOOD AND THE YOU THINK DJJ SPEAKER PUBLISHER ANALYSIS IS THREE HUNDRED. WILL BE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SOON MOSTER JUVENILE HALLS HAVE BEEN EMPTIED OUT SO THE KIDS THAT ARE THERE RIGHT NOW OR SOME OF YOUR- WORST OF THE WORST KIDS BAD KIDS IN INDEED THE- THAT IS A RICH SECOND CHANCE BUT- THIS JUST SETS A BAD PRECEDENT. WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THIS AND IT WILL EXIT WE HAVE A PROCESS RIGHT NOW PROVISION APARTMENT CAN GRANT THIS. THE JUDGE CAN GRANT IT. CURRENT DAY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE SAYING WITH THIS WHEN IT'S OKAY. LIKE I SAID. FOR SIX MONTHS FOR EVERYBODY DOESN'T DEFINE WHAT IT IS. WELL I DON'T CARE IF IT'S CRYSTAL CLEAR NOT TO STILL DEAL. BUT SIX MONTHS. AND YOU CAN BE RELEASED POTENTIALLY. AFTER SIX MONTHS. FOR ROBBERY FOR RAPE RIGHT NOW A LOT OF JUVENILE HALLS IN YOUR BOOK TO THE JUVENILE HALL FOR THE MOST PART. YOU GET OUT THE REAL ISSUE AND GIVEN THOSE TO APPEAR SO SEVERAL COUNTY THEY RELEASED JUTEL'S FOR RATE. VERY VIOLENT RAPES. WERE JUNE OF THE BEATING UP YOUNG GIRLS AND RAPED HIM. THEY'RE GONNA CITATION COURT TO APPEAR. ROBBERY ROBINSON- THE FIREARM BEING SOMEBODY UP VICIOUSLY THEY WERE GIVEN A CITATION TO APPEAR FOR COURT. SO WE'VE DONE A LOT OF REFORMS BUT- FOLKS IT'S TIME TO SLOW DOWN. WITH WHAT WE'RE DOING. AND LIKE I SAID. IT'S THE NUANCES LAST COST IS A MATTER IF YOU'RE IN JUVENILE HALL- GROUP OVER SOMEWHERE ELSE. THE BOTTOM LINE IS YOU ARRESTED YOU WERE CHARGED. AND READY TO GO THROUGH THE SYSTEM ARE YOU BEEN SLEEPING SINCE ACTUALLY. SO YOU KNOW WE GOTTA CHANGE THIS AND- LIKE I SAID WE'VE DONE A LOT THIS THIS GOES WAY TOO FAR. AND AT WHAT POINT DO WE STOP ABOUT THE VICTIMS OR MULTIPLE VICTIMS ESPECIALLY SEXUAL ASSAULT. THAT HAPPENS A LOT WITH OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE SUSPECTS IN THOSE CASES GET HELP. AND GET THE REHABILITATION BUT THERE'S NO MAGIC BUT WE'RE HEY SIX MONTHS AND YOU'RE FINE YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON AGAIN. I MEAN HAPPEN SOME CASES BUT IT TOOK TIME TO DEVELOP THIS TAPE BEHAVIOR AND IT TAKES TIME FOR THE RECOVERY THE BILL. SIX MONTHS YOUR BILL FOR SIX MORE MONTHS. SO IT'S JUST I GUESS SAID. IT'S THIS THIS BILL IS IF IT DOESN'T WORK RIGHT NOW- WE'RE GONNA PUT THE VICTIMS FIRST ALWAYS SAID THAT IN MY SEVEN YEARS HERE. THEY WERE TALKING. YOUNG VICTIMS A LOT OF THESE CASES. THERE IS COVER. MURATSUCHI YOU ARE RECOGNIZED AT YOUR DESK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU KNOW AS A- FORMER CRIMINAL PROSECUTOR. I CAN TELL YOU. THAT YOU KNOW WHEN I TALKED ABOUT. THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PROBATION I NEVER TALKED ABOUT I YOU KNOW I NEVER HEARD ANYONE HAVE ANY DISCUSSIONS ABOUT. YOU KNOW LET'S LOCK UP MORE BLACK AND BROWN KIDS FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME LET'S LET'S CREATE AVENUES TO KEEP BLACK AND BROWN KIDS IN CUSTODY OF FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME WELL WE TALKED ABOUT. WERE NOT ONLY IN THE CASE OF A JUVENILE COURT AND I NEVER PRACTICE IN JUVENILE COURT AND SO I'M LOOKING TO MISTER CUNNINGHAM MAYBE YOU CAN ENLIGHTEN US IN TERMS OF. YOU KNOW THE INS AND OUTS OF. OF JUVENILE COURT BUT- YOU KNOW IN GENERAL I KNOW THAT. THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF CRIMINAL SENTENCING- IS PROPORTIONALITY THAT WHEN YOU HAVE MORE SERIOUS CRIMES YOU GET A LONGER SENTENCE AND THAT INCLUDES PROBATION NOW I AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE BASICS OF JUVENILE COURT IS THAT THE FOCUS IS ON REHABILITATION BUT EVEN WITH REHABILITATION YOU KNOW SIX MONTHS. HOW CAN YOU CHANGE A KID'S AND HIS LIFE AROUND IN A SIX MONTH PERIOD NO I AGAIN I TALK WITH THE AUTHOR AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE PROVISIONS FOR THE COURT TO EXTEND THE PERIOD YOU KNOW IT IN A WAY THAT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE WARD OF THE JUVENILE. AWARD BUT THERE ARE OTHER CONSIDERATIONS THAT GO ON THE BALANCING ACT IN TERMS OF SENTENCING LIKE MAKING SURE THAT VICTIMS IN A HAVE ENOUGH THAT YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE TO RECEIVE RESTITUTION KNOW THAT IF OF THE PART TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S ENOUGH TIME FOR THE- THE WARD TO RECEIVE ENOUGH TIME TO COMPLY WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS INCLUDING PARTICIPATING. AND REHABILITATION PROGRAMS. I THINK SIX MONTHS. YOU KNOW JUST HAVING A FLAT OUT SIX MONTH CUT OFF FOR ALL JUVENILE WARD- IS. IN A PROGRAM THAT'S WHY I WILL BE OPPOSING THIS BILL. ALL THE BAIT. HAVING SEIZED. MISTER CUNNINGHAM YOUR RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I GOT CALLED OUT BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM MANHATTAN BEACH SO I GUESS I GOTTA I GOTTA TALK- LOOK I REPRESENTED. KIDS IN JUVENILE COURT- IT'S THE APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR THEM IF THEY'RE UNDER EIGHTEEN NOT LEGAL AGE OF MAJORITY. IT'S A REHABILITATION FOCUS THAT'S A GOOD THING THAT'S WHAT WE WANT- BUT IT OCCURS TO ME THOUGH. THAT ASK YOU TO THINK ABOUT THIS. IF YOU'RE SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD THREE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN YEARS AND THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR DAYS OLD. ADESH I'VE EIGHTEEN. AND YOU RATE A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD. IT'S PERHAPS THE CASE THAT SIX MONTHS ISN'T LONG ENOUGH FOR THE COURT TO ADDER ADEQUATELY SUPERVISE YOU AND FIGURE OUT WHETHER YOU HAVE BEEN REHABILITATED I WOULD SUBMIT TWELVE MONTHS PROBABLY ISN'T LONG ENOUGH I'D- SO I WOULD LIKE THIS BILL TO NOT PASS. I'D ENCOURAGE YOU TO VOTE NO LET'S GO BACK TO WORK A LITTLE BIT AND HAVE SOME EXEMPTIONS FOR SERIOUS HEINOUS VIOLENT CRIMES. AND HAVE A BILL THAT WE CAN ALL BE PROUD THANK YOU. SEEING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. ON THIS ITEM MISTER STONE YOU MAY CLOSE SURE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER LET'S LET'S GET SOME OF OUR FRAME OF REFERENCE HERE CORRECT. THE SIX MONTHS IS NOT A LIMITATION IS ESSENTIALLY A REVIEW. SO CERTAINLY IF THE OFFENSE IS. BAD ENOUGH AND I AND I KNOW WE WANT TO SORT OF LOOK AT THE WORST OF THE WORST OF THE WORST SITUATION AND EMOTIONALY. THAT JUST SEEMS TO BE VERY COMPELLING. BUT A COURT IS GOING TO HAVE TO REVIEW THAT CASE AFTER SIX MONTHS AND IF THEY'RE UNDER THE CURRENT BILL. IS CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE ALTHOUGH WE ARE WORKING WITH OUR SPONSORS ARE STAKEHOLDERS TO LOOK AT CHANGING THAT STANDARD. TO SORT OF MEET SOME OF WHAT THE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED HERE. AND THE INITIAL NOTION OF THE CLEAR AND CONVINCING IS WE'RE HOLDING KIDS AND YES WE ARE TALKING ABOUT KIDS WHO ARE POTENTIALLY. GUILTY OF IT'S A VERY SERIOUS CRIMES ARE THEY GOING TO BE NONCUSTODIAL ARE THEY GOING TO BE. OUT IN THE COMMUNITY IF IT'S THAT BAD OF A CRIME YEAH NO PROBABLY NOT. THESE ARE KIDS HOWEVER WHO FEDERAL PROBATION FOR TWO. THREE YEARS BECAUSE THEY'RE GUILTY OF SHOPLIFTING. BECAUSE THERE TRUANT THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO CHANGE AND SO YES A COURT IS GOING TO HAVE TO REVIEW THAT CASE AFTER SIX MONTHS. AND IF THERE'S A REASON BECAUSE THEY'RE IN REHAB. BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING A RESTITUTION PROGRAM. BECAUSE THEY ARE WORKING WITHIN THE COMMUNITY BASED ON THE TERMS OF THEIR PROBATION. COULD THAT GET EXTENDED FOR THESE VERY VERY SERIOUS CRIMES. ABSOLUTELY THAT'S HOW THE BILL'S DESIGN. THAT'S WHY THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE BEING CREATED IN THIS BILL. THE PROBATION CONDITIONS HAVE TO BE WHAT IS SPECIFIC TO THAT CHILD. INTO THAT CIRCUMSTANCE SO WE DON'T HAVE THE CASE WHERE SOMEONE HAS COMMITTED A MINOR OFFENSE. AND HAS VERY VERY SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CONDITION PROBATION CONDITIONS PUT ON THEIR PROBATION. ALMOST GUARANTEEING THAT THERE THAT THEY WILL FAIL. AND NO THERE IS NOT A DISCUSSION THIS IS A BLACK OR BROWN KID OR THIS IS A KID FROM THE ZIP CODE SO THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE. PROBATION CONDITIONS PUT ON THEM THE FACTS OF THE MATTER ARE HOWEVER IF IT IS A BLACK OR BROWN KID OR FROM CERTAIN ZIP CODES THEY WILL HAVE. MORE CONDITIONS PUT ON THEM. THAT'S A FACT IS THAT BLATANT RACISM. IS IT SORT OF. A BLATANT ATTEMPT TO GO AFTER CERTAIN ZIP CODES MAYBE MAYBE NOT IS IT INHERENT RACISM ABSOLUTELY. THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S AT STAKE IN THAT WITH THIS BILL AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE THE RESEARCH. AND TRYING TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THESE KIDS ARE GOING THROUGH HOW THEY'RE BEST SERVED WITHIN PROBATION DEPARTMENTS. AND ENSURE THAT THEY CAN BE. A PROPERLY SUPERVISED HAVE APPROPRIATE CONDITIONS PUT ON THEM BASED ON THE SEVERITY OF THE CRIME. BASED ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN. AND BUILD SOME BETTER CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE STATE COUNTY TO COUNTY. SO IF A CHILD IS GUILTY OF THE WORST OF THE WORST OF THESE HEINOUS CRIMES AS AS AS BEEN DETERMINED. THERE ARE APPROPRIATE MECHANISMS IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. AND THAT THEY ARE GOING TO SERVE. WHATEVER PUNISHMENT WE FEEL IS APPROPRIATE. BUT TOO OFTEN THESE ARE MINOR OFFENSES AND THESE KIDS ARE TREATED THE SAME AS IF THEY ARE A VERY SERIOUS OFFENDERS THAT'S THE PIECE WE HAVE TO GET OUT FROM UNDERNEATH HERE AND ENSURE THAT THOSE TERMS OF PROBATION ARE APPROPRIATE THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY BEING REVIEWED. ON A SIX MONTH BASIS SO THAT THEY DON'T JUST LANGUISH FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS BECAUSE AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS. COURTS HEAD DOOR DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM AGAIN FOR ANOTHER YEAR OR FOR TWO YEARS OR THE PROBATION SYSTEM JUST ONCE HAS THEM CYCLING ON PROBATION WITHOUT AN ABILITY TO GET OFF. AND ADDRESS HAVE BEEN DRESSED WHATEVER UNDERLYING ISSUE THERE IS THAT'S WHY THIS MAKES SENSE IT IS BASED ON THE RESEARCH IT IS BASED ON HOW WE ARE RESPONSIBLE TO OUR KIDS. AND IT IS INTENTIONALLY DESIGNED THIS WAY TO START TO UNDO. THE INHERENT RACISM THAT IS BUILT INTO THE PROBATION SYSTEM AND HOW WOULD DEALS WITH KIDS OF COLOR AND KIDS IN OUR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I'VE- WITH THAT KERR CALL THE ROLL. SORRY ABOUT ALL THE VERGE VOTERS OUT OF A. ALL MEMBERS VOTERS OUT OF VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTERS OUT OF A. MR STONE MOOSE CALL. PASS RETAIN A BALANCE TWENTY FIVE THIS IS FILE ITEM. TWENTY SIX. HI MR MEDINA KRIKORIAN. ASSEMBLY BILL THREE THIRTY SEVEN BY SOME REMEMBER MEDINA AND OTHERS AN ACT RELATING THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES MISTER MEDINA. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. AB THREE THIRTY SEVEN SEEKS TO AMPLIFY THE VOICE OF STUDENTS AND INCREASE THE REPRESENTATION ON THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS AT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THE STUDENT MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS EXERCISE A CRITICAL ROLE IN REPRESENTING MORE THAN TWO POINT ONE MILLION STUDENTS AT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THERE ARE CURRENTLY TWO STUDENT MEMBERS ON THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS BUT ONLY ONE HAS THE ABILITY TO VOTE. THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN SHAPING THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE AT CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE. YET STUDENTS LACK ADEQUATE REPRESENTATION. IN SUCH AN EXPANSIVE AND DIVERSE HIGHER EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IT IS SOMETIMES SIMPLY UNFEASIBLE THE ONE STUDENT CAN DO JUSTICE TO REPRESENT THE PLURALITY OF THOUGHT AND DIVERSITY OF EXPERIENCE CONTAIN AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. AB THREE THIRTY SEVEN WOULD ALLOW BOTH STUDENT MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS TO BE FULLY EMPOWERED VOTING MEMBERS AT THE BEGINNING OF THEIR APPOINTMENT. AB THREE THIRTY SEVEN WOULD NOT ALTER ANY PART OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS APPOINTMENT PROCESS OR THE TOTAL NUMBER. OF MEMBERS. THEREFORE AB THREE THIRTY SEVEN WOULD ALLOW FOR MORE RECOGNITION OF THE DIVERSE RANGE OF STUDENT VIEWS AND SEND A STRONG MESSAGE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF INCLUDING THE STUDENT PERSPECTIVE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MR MEDINA. SEEING NO DISCUSSION DEBATE ON THE ITEM OR CALL THE ROLL. IT IS OUR VOTE ALL MEMBERS VOTERS ARE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS SERVICE OUT OF VOTE.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS TODAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB FOUR ONE NINE. UNDER CURRENT LAW PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION ABOUT A VICTIM OR WITNESS SUCH AS SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER BIRTHDATE EMPLOYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER AND BIOMETRIC INFORMATION AMONGST A HOST OF OTHER THINGS ARE NOT PROTECTED. THE DEFENDANT OR THEIR FAMILY COULD REQUEST AND RECEIVE THAT INFORMATION WITHOUT A COURT ORDER. AB FOUR ONE NINE IT'S A SIMPLE MEASURE TO PROTECT CERTAIN TYPES OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION THAT CAN BE DISCLOSED TO A DEFENDANT. IF SUCH INFORMATION IS NEEDED BY THE DEFENSE TO BUILD THE CASE THIS BILL KEEPS CURRENT LAW INTACT BY ALLOWING THE COURTS REQUIRE THAT INFORMATION BE GIVEN. AB FOUR ONE NINE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO HELP GIVE VICTIMS AND WITNESSES OF CRIME. THE PEACE OF MIND THAT IF THEY COME FORWARD WITH INFORMATION ABOUT A CASE THAT STATE CAN PROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THEM.
