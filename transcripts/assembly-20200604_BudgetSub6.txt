SO GOOD JUST- GO REVIEW VERY QUICKLY WITH THE AGENDA IS AFTER OPENING COMMENTS BY ANY MEMBERS WE THE PANEL TODAY WHERE WE HAVE THE LA- PROVIDING ANALYSIS WE ALSO HAVE ON THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THEN WE GO TO A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS AND THEN WE'LL GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT. SO AGAIN JUST VERY QUICKLY- TODAY WE ARE PRESENTING THE LEGISLATURE'S TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET- THE LEGISLATURE'S TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET BUILT ON THE ARCHITECTURE FROM THE GOVERNOR SO WE ALSO HAVE A TRIGGER THAT IS DEPENDENT ON FEDERAL FUNDING. WE ARE VERY CLEAR THAT WE CAN'T GO GO THIS ALONE SO WE ARE ASKING WASHINGTON DC FOR HELP HOW WITH OUR- TO FOR WORK WITH HOLD OFF MANY OF THE CUTS THAT WERE. ORIGINALLY PROPOSED- THEY'RE NOT IN THE TRIGGER AS WELL AS THEY ARE NOT- PROPOSED CUTS SO IN TERMS OF. CUTS THAT WERE ORIGINALLY PROPOSED MAY REVISED TO CHILD CARE EDUCATION HEALTH CARE- SENIORS FAMILIES MANY OF THOSE CUTS DO NOT ARE NOT IN OUR TRIGGER- WITHIN THE TRIGGER WE DO HAVE DEFERRALS TO EDUCATION. WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THE- KEY THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WILL STILL BE ALLOWED TO SPEND THE MONEY THIS IS MONEY THAT IS OFFERED AT OFF FOR A LATER DATE. IF THE FEDERAL FUNDING DOES NOT COMMAND THERE ARE TRIGGER CUTS TO YOU SEE CSU AS WELL AS TO JUDICIAL COUNCIL. ON AT A TIME WHEN PEOPLE NEED GOVERNMENT THE MOST WE THOUGHT IT WAS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO NOT CUT HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES- MANY OF THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET SERVICES THAT ARE VERY QUORUM. TO PEOPLE WHO AT TIMES OF FULL EMPLOYMENT WERE READY LIVING ON THE EDGE FOR THE MILLIONS OF FAMILIES WHO APPLIED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT. WHO ALREADY WERE WERE STRUGGLING WHEN THEY WERE WORKING FULL TIME. WE KNOW IT'S OBSOLETE CRITICAL TO KEEP THEM IN THEIR HOMES IT'S CRITICAL TO BE ABLE TO OFFER THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET SERVICES SUCH AS CAL WORKS CAL FRESH MEDI CAL. CRITICAL CRITICAL SUPPORT SERVICES TO MAKE SURE THEIR FOOD SHELTER AND HEALTH CARE ALSO- WE AGREED THAT WE NEEDED TO. BE RESPONSIBLE AND LOOK AT A REVENUE PROPOSAL WE THOUGHT THAT THE- REVIEW PROPOSAL PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT A GOVERNOR MADE SENSE- SUSPENDING. CORD TMPORARILY SUSPENDING CORPORATE TAX DEDUCTIONS FOR A COUPLE YEARS- MADE A LOT OF SENSE IN TERMS OF GENERATING OVER FOUR BILLION DOLLARS OF REVENUE. IF WE DIDN'T I GENERATE THIS FOUR BILLION DOLLARS OF REVENUE THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO CUT- SCHOOLS AGAIN BY ALMOST TWO BILLION. AS WELL AS LOOKING AYE CUTTING HEALTH CARE AS WELL AS SOME OF THE OTHER. FIFTEEN AT SERVICES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT THE SO MANY FAMILIES AND SENIORS ARE RELYING ON- AGAIN OVER HALF OF. THE GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURE GOES TO EDUCATION STARTED FROM EARLY EDUCATION UP TO HIGHER EDUCATION- WITHOUT IS VERY CRITICAL TO PRESERVE THAT. SPENDING WE INSURED THAT NOT ONLY WE PRESERVE THE SPENDING BUT THEY WERE SMALL COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS TO- ALL THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS WHETHER IT WAS CHILD CARE. AND EARLY EDUCATION K. THROUGH TWELVE AS WELL AS OUR INSTITUTIONS HIGHER. EDUCATION IT IS AN- WE WERE VERY PROUD OF THE GOVERNOR AND HE FOCUSED HIS OF THE STATE SOLELY ON HOMELESSNESS. SO WE AREN'T MEANT TO THE GOVERNOR'S HOME WITH THIS PROPOSAL. BY ADDITIONAL THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. TO BE SPENT WE WANTED TO KEEP THAT SPENDING FLEXIBLE TO REALLY ALLOW DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS TO AGAIN TACKLE HOMELESSNESS IN. WAYS THAT MADE SENSE IN WAYS THAT WERE SUCCESSFUL LOCALLY. AGAIN WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THIS BUDGET WE THINK THAT THESE THESE BUDGETS BOTH THESE BUDGETS ARE MOVING. IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND WE LOOK FORWARD- OVER THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS TO DISCUSSING HOW WE CAN. COME TOGETHER ON ONE SINGULAR BUDGET THAT WILL GET PASSED ON JUNE. FIFTEENTH WITHOUT I'M GONNA TURN OVER TO MR WANTING. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU I THINK THIS BUDGET HAS COME A LONG WAYS IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS I'D LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE- IT ON THE- THE COMMITTEES AND ALL OF OUR STAFFS FOR THEIR HARD WORK- ALSO WHAT I THINK WOULD BE A LOT OF PROGRESS IN SHIFTING THE CUTS TO. AREAS THAT ARE GOING TO BE THE MOST IMPACTFUL ON THE VERY SAME PEOPLE THAT WERE TRYING TO HELP. I THINK THOSE WERE VERY APPROPRIATE- IN PARTICULAR I WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND- CHRISTIAN FOR. HELP YOUR WORK ON- HELPING TO KEEP THE BARSTOW VETERANS HOME OPEN ANOTHER PEOPLE BAR STONER VETERANS ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE FOR THAT WORK- I DO REMAIN CONCERNED HOWEVER ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF INNER FUND BORROWING AND THE NUMBER OF DEFERRALS THATREMAIN IN THIS BUDGET AND- HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT- THIS AFTERNOON BECAUSE I REALLY I REALLY THINK THAT WERE NOT BEING REALISTIC IN SOME WAYS ABOUT THE SCOPE. OF THIS RECESSION AND HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO LAST- AND I ALSO. WANT TO STILL BE VERY INTROSPECTIVE ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING TO THE STATES PARTICULARLY TO CALIFORNIA- BUT- I KNOW WE ARE VERY HOPEFUL THAT THE STATE IS GOING TO GET MORE FEDERAL AID I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE BEING REALISTIC ABOUT THE- POSSIBILITY OF THAT OCCURRING. AND BEING REALISTIC ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO DO AS IT STATE GOVERNMENT IF THAT IS NOT MATERIALIZE SO I THINK MISTER CHAIRMAN LOOKING FOR THE. THANK YOU OPEN COMMENTS AUTORAMA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR CONVENING SUB SIX ON THE NEXT STAGE OF OUR BUDGET PROCESS FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEAR. OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE RESPONSIBLE AND WE ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO THIS MOMENT. PEOPLE HAVE LOST PATIENCE BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T SEEN PROGRESS. OUR GOVERNOR SPOKE THESE WORDS JUST A FEW DAYS AGO AND THAT IT IT IS MY HOPE THAT WE CAN KEEP THISSENTIMENT AND WHAT WE HAVE BEEN WITNESSING AT THE CENTER OF OUR ACTIONS TODAY. AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON A BUDGET THAT WILL AFFECT OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN PARTICULAR ARE BLACK COMMUNITY. AS CHAIR OF SUB ONE OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES MY SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY TO THE PEOPLE HAS NEVER BEEN STRONGER. I BELIEVE NOW MORE THAN EVER THAT WE NEED A STRONG HEALTHCARE SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM AND CONTINUED INVESTMENTS TO OUR SAFETY NET PROGRAMS. SERVING OUR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE PROGRAMS WHERE WE CAN SUCH AS INVESTMENTS IN OUR- ACHIEVING HEALTH FOR ALL IS A MORAL OBLIGATION. AND ENSURING THAT WE MAKE SMART HEALTH FINANCING DECISIONS AND HOW WE INVEST OR PROP FIFTY SIX DOLLARS HELPS US TO MEET OUR MORAL AND FISCAL OBLIGATIONS INTO THE FUTURE. I ECHO THE SENTIMENTS OF COUNTLESS ADVOCATES SAY OF METS WITH THESE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS. IN THAT IF WE TAKE STEPS BACK AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WE ARE AGGRAVATING THE SUFFERING FOR FAMILIES AND WE ARE PROLONGING THE CURRENT FISCAL CRISIS. I FIRMLY BELIEVE AND EVER PETER LEAVE VOICED ON THIS DíAS THAT AN INVESTMENT IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS AND SAFETY NET PROGRAMS ARE AN INVESTMENT TO OUR ECONOMIC HEALTH. WE SHOULD NOT TAKE LIGHTLY THAT SUPPORTING VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND REBUILDING OUR ECONOMY ARE INDEED ONE AND THE SAME. OUR HEARING TODAY SYMBOLIZES AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS GETTING CLOSER TO FULFILLING OUR CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION TO PASS A BALANCED BUDGET BY JUNE FIFTEENTH. I AM PLEASED AND HOPEFUL THAT THIS ARCHITECTURE LAID OUT IN THE PROPOSED ASSEMBLY BUDGET PLAN WHILE STILL RECOGNIZING THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO IN THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE JUNE FIFTEENTH DEADLINE. I AM COMMITTED TO MEETING THIS MOMENT AND TO WORK COLLECTIVELY WITH COLLEAGUES AND ADVOCATES TO REACH A FINAL AGREEMENT. IT IS MY SHARED HOPE THAT THE DECISIONS WE MAKE TODAY AND MOVE. FORWARD AS A BODY MAKE POSITIVE MEANINGFUL IMPACT FOR ALL COMMUNITIES. AND THE BUDGET PLAN ACTIVELY WORKS IN A MANNER THAT IMPROVES CONDITIONS FOR THE PEOPLE. NOT TO WORSEN THEM. I AM COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO ADDRESS THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND TO EXPLORE INNOVATIVE WAYS TO INCREASE REVENUE THAT STRENGTHENS OUR STATE ECONOMIC RESPONSE AND RECOVERY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS BY THE MEMBERS. ANY OTHER COMMENTS SO NOW WE'RE GONNA GO TO MISTER PATRICK KELLY UP. MR BUT IF WE DON'T HAVE VOLUME SO IF. I KNOW IF YOU'RE MUTED OR- OR HELLO THIS IS LOOKING. I STILL DON'T HEAR ANYTHING. RIGHT ABOUT. OKAY THERE WE GO PERFECT THANK YOU OKAY MY APOLOGIES. SO GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MISTER VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR INVITING OUR OFFICE TO PARTICIPATE IN TODAY'S HEARING WE WERE ASKED BY COMMITTEE STAFF TO PRESENT SORT OF A CROSSWALK BETWEEN. THE MAY REVISION AND THE NEW LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE THAT YOU WERE JUST DISCUSSING SO JUST A BRIEF NOTE ON THAT I WOULD I WOULD. POINT OUT THAT WHILE WE ARE VERY PLEASED TO PROVIDE THIS CROSSWALK WE WERE NOT INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PACKAGING SO TO THE EXTENT YOU HAVE. QUESTIONS ABOUT DETAIL PROVISIONS THAT THAT- COME UP TODAY- THERE MAY BE OTHERS ON THE COMMITTEE THAT COULD YOU COULD- RESPOND TO THOSE- OF OUR BETTER POSITION TO RESPOND TO THOSE. ALSO ON I WOULD JUST MENTION THAT- HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE A COPY OF TWO OF THE HANDOUT THAT I PLAN TO WALK THROUGH TODAY. I AM BUT FOR IT FOR ANYONE FOLLOWING ALONG. YOU COULD ALSO ACCESS THE SAME HAND OUT ON OUR WEBSITE AT. L. A. O. DOT SEE A DOC OF. OKAY SO WITH THAT I WILL GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED. ON PAGE ONE. TO BEGIN WITH- JUST SORT OF A BRIEF HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF SOME OF THE KEY ASSUMPTIONS THAT WENT INTO THE TWO PACKAGES ALL TOUCH ON REVENUES BASELINE SPENDING AND THEN THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE RELATED TO FEDERAL FUNDING. ON REVENUES AS MR TANG ALREADY MENTIONED. THE BOTH PACKAGES ARE USING LARGELY THE SAME SET OF ASSUMPTIONS AND BOTH DO. LOOK TO AUGMENT THE STATE REVENUE BASE ON A TEMPORARY BASIS BY SUSPENDING THE USE OF NET OPERATING LOSSES AND- LIMITING THE USE OF TAX CREDITS TARGETING PRIMARILY- MEDIUM AND LARGER SIZE BUSINESSES SO THOSE SUSPENSIONS AND LIMITATIONS WOULD BE IN PLACE FOR THOSE FOR THE UPCOMING THREE FISCAL YEARS AD WOULD GENERATE AN ESTIMATED FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION IN. ADDITIONAL REVENUE IN THE IN THE BUDGET PACKAGE. WHEN IT COMES TO BASS LINE SPENDING THE- LEGISLATIVE BUDGET PACKAGE DEPARTS FROM THE MAY REVISION BY USING THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE OUR OFFICES ESTIMATES FOR CASELOADS IN PARTICULAR WE HAVE DIFFERENT ESTIMATES THEN THE ADMINISTRATION DOES FOR CAL WORKS IN FOR MEDI CAL. IN CAL WORKS ARE ARE- CASELOAD ESTIMATES ARE QUITE A BIT LOWER THAN WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATED AND BY USING OUR ESTIMATES IN IN THAT AREA THERE THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET PACKAGE CAN RECOGNIZE AROUND TWO POINT NINE BILLION IN BUDGET SAVINGS IN THE GENERAL FUND. ON MEDI CAL WE HAVE SIMILAR CASELOAD ESTIMATES BUT WE HAVE DIFFERENT- COST PER CASE LOAD ESTIMATES THAN THE ADMINISTRATION AND BY USING OUR ESTIMATES IN THIS AREA. THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET PACKAGE CAN REALIZE AROUND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION AND- LOWER COSTS AND SO THE COMBINED- DIFFERENCES THERE'S AROUND THREE POINT SIX BILLION AND- LOWER BASELINE SPENDING EXPECTATIONS UNDER THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET PACKAGE. OKAY WHEN IT COMES TO FEDERAL FUNDING THIS IS WHERE THE TWO PACKAGES REALLY HAVE A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT APPROACH AND THEY ARE DIFFERENT SUCH THAT THEIR THEIR BASELINE ASSUMPTIONS ON ON WHETHER OR NOT ADDITIONAL FEDERAL AID WILL BE FORTHCOMING MAKES IT SO THAT IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF DIFFICULT TO COMPARE THE TWO PACKAGES. ACCORDING TO THEIR BASELINE ASSUMPTIONS SO WHAT I MEAN IS AS MR TING ALREADY ALLUDED TO THE- THE MAY REVISION IS STARTING FROM A PRESUMPTION THAT NO ADDITIONAL FEDERAL ASSISTANCE WILL BE FORTHCOMING AND THEREFORE. ON JULY FIRST- IT INCLUDES AROUND FIFTEEN BILLION IN REDUCTIONS. BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES- TRIGGER PROVISIONS THAT WOULD. REVERSE THOSE REDUCTIONS IN THE EVENT THAT ADDITIONAL FEDERAL AID WERE TO ARRIVE. THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET PACKAGE ON THE OTHER HAND STARTS FROM THE PRESUMPTION THAT WE WILL RECEIVE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL AID- HOWEVER IN THAT CASE THE CONTINGENCY IS A TRIGGER REDUCTION THAT WOULD TAKE PLACE ON OCTOBER FIRST IF THE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING DOES NOT MATERIALIZE. SO BECAUSE THOSE TWO BASELINE ASSUMPTIONS ARE KIND OF COMING AT THIS FROM A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT PLACES OF THE BALANCE OF MY REMARKS WILL COMPARE THE TWO PACKAGES UNDER THESE DIFFERENT SCENARIOS ONE WHERE WE DO HAVE THE DIGITAL FEDERAL AID. AND THE OTHER WHERE WE DON'T HAVE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL LAKES I THINK THAT IS PROBABLY THE CLEAREST WAY TO TALK ABOUT IT. SO MOVING TO THE SECOND PAGE OF THE OF THE HANDOUT. I'LL START WITH TOUCHING ON THE CASE IN WHICH THERE IS ADDITIONAL FEDERAL AID. IN THIS CASE THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET PACKAGE AND THE MAY REVISION ARE ACTUALLY BROADLY SIMILAR WITH A FEW KEY DIFFERENCES. ALL JUST TOUCH ON A FEW- THAT ONE ONE NOTABLE DIFFERENCES THAT THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET PACKAGE WOULD IN THE FISCAL YEAR WITH AROUND A BILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL RESERVE HIGHER TOTAL RESERVE BALANCES- AT THE END OF IT BUDGET YEAR ANOTHER. COUPLE OF POINTS OLD NOTE- ONE IS THAT THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET PACKAGE PROVIDES AROUND A BILLION DOLLARS OF FUNDING FOR COUNTIES FOR THE REALIGNMENT PROGRAMS- REALIGNMENT FUNDING IS EXPECTED TO SUFFER SOME SIGNIFICANT. DECREASES BECAUSE OF THE COVERT NINETEEN RECESSION. AND THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET PACKAGE RECOGNIZES THE- DIFFICULTY THAT THAT WOULD PUT THE COUNTIES IN FROM A FISCAL STANDPOINT AND WOULD PROVIDE ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS OF FUNDING TO HELP ALLEVIATE THOSE STRESSES ALTHOUGH- AROUND SIX HUNDRED MILLION OF IT WOULD BE- THE SUBJECT TO TRIGGER REDUCTION IN THE EVENT WE DON'T RECEIVE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL AID. ON SIMILARLY THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET PACKAGE DOES PROVIDE SOME AUGMENTATION TO FUNDING FOR THE UNIVERSITY'S. HOUSE CAL STATE UNIVERSITY IN THE UC SYSTEM'S ALTHOUGH THAT FUNDING TO WOULD BE SUBJECT TO REDUCTION IF ADDITIONAL- FEDERAL MONEY IS NOT FORTHCOMING. THERE ARE TWO AREAS WHERE YOU KNOW THAT ARE DIFFERENT REGARDLESS OF FEDERAL FUNDING THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET PACKAGE PROVIDES THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION IN LOCAL HOMELESSNESS FUNDING. AND ALSO WOULD EXPAND THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT PROGRAM TO INCLUDE- TAXPAYERSTHAT FILE USING INDIVIDUAL TAX IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS I TEN FILERS WITH CHILDREN AT THE AGES SIX AND UNDER SO- THOSE TWO ITEMS ARE SHOWN AT THE LATTER PART OF THE TWO BOTTOM POINTS ON THE ON THE FIRST SECTION OF THE- THIS PAGE. NOW I'LL TURN TO TALKING ABOUT HOW THE TWO PACKAGES DIFFER IN THE EVENT THE STATE DOES NOT RECEIVE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL AID BECAUSE IN THIS CASE THE PACKAGES ARE QUITE DIFFERENT. MOVING TO PAGE THREE ALL START WITH- DISCUSSION OF BUDGET RESERVES AND ACTUALLY IF I IF I MAY I WOULD- TALKED- BEGIN BY SPEAKING TO THE SECOND BULLET POINT THERE THE CODED NINETEEN CONTINGENCY FUND AS YOU RECALL THIS WAS A PROPOSAL IN THE MAY REVISION TO ESTABLISH A TWO POINT NINE BILLION DOLLAR. A CONTINGENCY FUND- THAT WOULD BE USED TO PAY FOR AS YET UNKNOWN- CODE RED NINETEEN RELATED RESPONSE ACTIVITIES. THE WAY THAT THE FUNDING FOR THIS FOR THIS FUND WHICH WOULD BE- COME TO BE UNDER THE NAY REVISION WAS. FIRST WITH AN APPROPRIATION FROM THE GENERAL FUND FOR SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS WHICH WOULD SERVE AS A STATE AS THE STATE'S MATCH. TO GENERATE AN ADDITIONAL ROUGHLY TWO POINT TWO BILLION IN FEDERAL FEMA FUNDING. SO THE TOTAL WOULD BE TWO POINT NINE BILLION BUT WITH THE STATE COST REALLY BEING THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN MILLION. SO THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET PERHAPS A PACKAGE. REJECT THE CREATION OR ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS FUND AND RATHER IT TAKES THE SAME STATE CONTRIBUTION TO THAT FUND THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN MILLION AND DESIGNATED WITHIN THE- SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES. AND IT WOULD THEN BE AVAILABLE LATER IN THE YEAR IN THE EVENT WE NEED. THE ADDITIONAL MONEY TO ADDRESS CODED NINETEEN RELATED RESPONSE ACTIVITIES. THE OTHER ITEM I WANTED TO TOUCH ON HERE IS THAT. YOU'D SEE THAT THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE DRAWS DOWN A BIT MORE IN THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT AND WHAT THAT MAY REVISION PROPOSED- JUST AS A BRIEF REMINDER I THINK IT CAN BE HELPFUL UNDER PROPOSITION TWO. HALF OF THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT IS AVAILABLE IN THE FIRST YEAR OF A BUDGET EMERGENCY. AND AS A REMINDER THE BUDGET EMERGENCY IS THAT CAN BE- ESTABLISHED IN TWO WAYS ONE THROUGH A- NATURAL DISASTER DECLARATION- AND THEN THE OTHER WAY IS TO IF THE GOVERNOR DECLARES A FISCAL EMERGENCY. IN A FISCAL EMERGENCY IS DEFINED AS A CIRCUMSTANCE IN WHICH- RESOURCES IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND THE UP COMING YEAR ARE EXPECTED TO BE INSUFFICIENT TO COVER- THIS IS SPENDING AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF THE PAST THREE BUDGETS ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION AND POPULATION. SO TODAY AT IT AS WE SPEAK WE HAVE AROUND A SIXTEEN POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT BALANCE. AND YOU SEE THAT WE WOULD BE TO BRING IT DOWN TO SIX POINT FIVE BILLION UNDER THE LEGISLATIVE PLAN. WHICH IS CLEARLY MORE THAN HALF OF THE SIXTEEN POINT TWO SO- YEAH I CAN BRIEFLY ADDRESSED THAT AND- OF THE SIXTEEN BILLION ABOUT THREE BILLION HAS BEEN PUT INTO THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT IN RECENT YEARS ON AN OPTIONAL BASIS. SO YOU KNOW THE VIEW IS THAT ALL OF THAT THREE BILLION IS AVAILABLE WHICH THEN LEADS OF A THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT BALANCE SO HALF OF THAT IS SIX SIX AND A HALF BILLION OR SO APPROXIMATELY AND THEN WHEN YOU BRING THAT AND ADD IT TO THE THREE BILLION THAT'S HOW WE REDUCE THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT BY- ROUND OVER NINE BILLION DOWN TO THE SIX POINT FIVE. OKAY MOVING TO SLIDE FOR. BUT THIS IS AN AREA WHERE THERE'S SOME OTHER DIFFERENCES FROM THE NAY REVISION THIS IS IN THE CATEGORY OF CAUTIOUS AND- INTER FUND TRANSFERS SO IF I MADE DRY YOUR ATTENTION TO THE MIDDLE ROW THERE WHERE IT SAYS REINSTATE DEFERRALS. YOU WOULD SEE THAT THE AMOUNT LISTED IS ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION. UNDER THE LEGISLATIVE PLAN. THAT IS THAT REFLECTS TO DEFERRALS THAT THE LEGISLATIVE PLAN CONTEMPLATES ONE IS THE A DEFERRAL OF THE FOURTH QUARTER STATE THIS DEFERRAL OF THE STATE'S FOURTH QUARTER CONTRIBUTION TO CALPERS- FROM LATE JUNE EARLY JULY. AND THEN IT ALSO INCLUDES A- DEFERRAL OF THE JUNE PAYROLL- FROM THE YOU KNOW BY BASICALLY ONE DAY FROM THE AT THE VERY END OF JUNE TO THE FIRST DAY OF JULY. NOW THERE'S AN IMPORTANT- YOU KNOW- ADD ON THAT I NEED TO MAKE TO THAT AND THAT IS THAT THE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL INCLUDES. WHAT I WOULD CALL A JANUARY DETERMINATION PROVISION. SO IF IT IF WE GET TO JANUARY AND IT APPEARS THAT THE STATE'S FISCAL CONDITION IS BETTER IN BETTER CONDITION THAN WHAT IT IS AT THE TIME OF BUDGET ENACTMENT. SO THAT WOULD BE MEASURED BY HIGHER REVENUES SOME COMBINATION OF HIGHER REVENUES IN LOWER EXPENDITURES THAN WE THOUGHT WHEN THE BUDGET IS ENACTED AT THAT YOU KNOW IN JUNE. AND IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN THIS PAYROLL THE PEARL WOULD NOT GO FORWARD IT WOULD BE ELIMINATED BUT- STARTING FROM JUST THE BASELINE ASSUMPTIONS WE'RE SHOWING IT IN THIS LIFE. AND ANOTHER KEY POINT ABOUT THESE DEFERRALS IS THAT THEY WOULD APPLY TO BOTH THE GENERAL FUND AND TO THE STATE'S SPECIAL FUNDS. SO THEN THIS SPECIAL FUNDS THE SAVINGS THAT WOULD BE REALIZED BY THE SPECIAL FUNDS BY BY- IMPLEMENTING THESE DEFERRALS WOULD BE SHIFTED TO THE GENERAL FUND IN THE FORM OF A LOAN TO THE GENERAL FUND AND SO ACTUALLY IF THE THIS RELATES TO THE LINE OR THE ROW JUST ABOVE REINSTATEMENT DEFERRALS THE FIRST ROW SPECIAL FIND LOANS AND TRANSFERS YOU'LL NOTE THAT THE- LEGISLATURE. IS IT IS ABOUT ONE POINT ONE BILLION HIGHER THAN THE NAY REVISION IN THIS AREA. AND THAT ONE POINT ONE BILLION. IS REALLY THE REFLECTION OF THAT THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE SAVINGS THAT I JUST DESCRIBED- THAT THEIR SPECIAL FUNDS WOULD REALIZE FROM THESE- DEFERRALS. SO THAT'S HOW THE TWO TWO ROWS RELATE TO ONE ANOTHER. OKAY MOVING TO. THAT SLIDE FIVE. HERE I WOULD SPEAK ABOUTTHE FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE FUNDING UNDER THE LEGISLATIVE PLAN THERE IN THIS IS A CASE WHERE THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING- TO ADDRESS THE CODED RECESSION. IN THIS CASE IN THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET PLAN FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES DIFFERS FROM THE NAY REVISION IN THAT THERE IS NO REDUCTION AND TO THE OVERALL LEVEL OF FUN FUNDING THAT GOES TO THE SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN FACT THERE'S AN INCREASE AND COMPARED WITH THE MAY REVISION- FUNDING FOR THE FOR THE SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES WOULD BE HIGHER THAN THE NAY REVISION BY ABOUT. EIGHT BILLION. THE SOURCE OF HIGHER FUNDING IN THE LEGISLATIVE PLAN IS FROM FROM TWO PLACES ONE IS THE- PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING LEVEL OF PROVIDED BY THE GENERAL FUND WOULD BE ABOVE THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE AND IT WOULD BE- FOR ABOUT TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS ABOUT THAT LEVEL. THEN IN ADDITION. THERE WOULD BE THE USE OF THE LEGISLATIVE PLAN WOULD CONVERT ABOUT FIVE POINT THREE BILLION OF FUNDING TO DEFERRALS AND AT THE SAME TIME PRESERVE- IN DOING SO PRESERVE THE PROGRAMMATIC LEVEL OF FUNDING FOR THE SCHOOLS BUT WITH THAT RELATIVE TO THE MAY REVISION AN ADDITIONAL FIVE POINT THREE BILLION OF THAT BEING PROVIDED IN- DEFERRAL IN DEFERRED FUNDS. SO THE FIVE POINT THREE BILLION PLUS THE TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION IS HOW YOU GET TO THE EIGHT BILLION. IN HIGHER FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS UNDER THE LEGISLATIVE PLAN RELATIVE TO THE NAY REVISION. OKAY MOVING FINALLY HERE TO THE LAST PAGE ON SLIDE SIX. THIS SLIDE DISPLAYS SOME OF THE MAJOR PROGRAMMATIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM A REVISION AND THE LEGISLATIVE PLAN AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE SCENARIO WHERE THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING THAT BECOMES AVAILABLE. I WOULD SAY THAT THIS SLIDE REALLY IS AT THE HEART OF HOW THE TWO PACKAGES DIFFER FROM ONE ANOTHER. YOU WOULD NOTE- AS- DOCTOR RANDY LISTED. THE TO THE LEGISLATIVE PLAN HERE REJECTS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED. REPURPOSE SCENE OF THE PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDS TO. WHICH IN THE MAY REVISION IT WITH THOSE THE FUNDING THERE WOULD BE USED TO PAY FOR GROWTH IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM THE LEGISLATIVE PLAN- REJECTS DOUBTING WOULD CONTINUE TO USE THE FUNDS. FOR SIMILARLY THE LEGISLATIVE PLAN REJCTS THE PROPOSAL TO REDUCE THE AYE HSS SERVICE HOURS. AND YOU KNOW SO THE OTHER ITEMS YOU CAN SEE HERE LISTED ON THE SLIDE IN THESE THESE ARE- SOME OF WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. AS KEY PROGRAMMATIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO PACKAGES. BUT I WOULD JUST POINT OUT TO INCLUDE MY PREPARED REMARKS THAT YOU KNOW THE WAY THAT THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET PACKAGE IS ABLE TO PROVIDE THESE OR MAINTAIN THE FUNDING LEVEL FOR THE SERVICES IS REALLY. SUMMARIZED IN THREE POINTS- FIRST THE USE OF THE LA- CASELOADS AS I WAS SAYING EARLIER SECOND THE L. THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE USES A BIT MORE OF THE STATE'S RESERVES- THAN THE NAY REVISION WOULD. AND THEN THIRD- THEN THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE DOES USE. A BIT MORE CAUTIOUS- AS I JUST TALKED ABOUT UNDER THAT EARLIER SLIDE SO THOSE THREE ACTIONS ARE REALLY WHAT PROVIDE THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AT LEAST ON AT. A ONE TIME BASIS IN A COUPLE OF THOSE CASES- THE ENABLE THAT THE PACKAGE TO SUSTAIN THESE PROGRAMS AS DESCRIBED ON THE SIX A SLIGHT. SO WITH THAT THAT'S A SUMMARY OF. HOW WE VIEW THE TWO PACKAGES AND HOW THE- OR SIMILAR AND HOW THEY ARE DIFFERENT HOW THEY DIFFER. WITH THAT I WILL BE HAPPY TO. RESPOND TO QUESTIONS WHEN THE TIME IS APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU WITHOUT WILL GO TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MISTER THIS WHEN THEY- DO YOU MISTER CHANG MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'LL KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF AT AND JUST MAKE THREE POINTS- ABOUT- A REVISION AND THE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL. THE FIRST IS I WANT TO NOTE LIKE MR PADDACK- NUMBEROF ITEMS THAT ARE IN COMMON BETWEEN THE NAY REVISIONS AND THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET PROPOSAL IN PARTICULAR- GRATEFUL FOR A. B. CONTINUED PLUSH. AMONG MEMBERS FOR A GREATER FEDERAL FUNDS IN ACTION AND CONGRESS. WE APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THE REVENUES- ESTIMATES FOR EACH OF THESE PACKAGES ARE THE SAME- AND AT THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDES THE TEMPORARY NEW REVENUES. THAT WERE IN THE NAY REVISION. AND WHILE AS MR PADDOCK NOTED WE HAVE AYE DIFFERENCES ON CASE WHAT ASSUMPTIONS AND- ON A KIND OF SEVERAL BILLION DOLLARS WE KNOW THAT SOMETHING THAT WILL BE CONTINUING TO DISCUSS- IN THE DAYS AHEAD. THIS POINT I WANT TO MAKE THOUGH ABOUT LEGISLATURE PROPOSAL THAT THE ADMINISTRATION DOES REMAIN CONCERNED. ABOUT STRUCTURAL DEFICITS PARTICULARLY IN THE OUT YEARS AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT IN THE MAIL REVISION. EVEN THE BUDGET THAT WE PUT FORWARD HAD SOME STRUCTURAL ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED- IN THE YEARS AFTER THE BUDGET YEAR. AND THAT IS WHAT OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE REVENUES. NOW AS EVERYONE KNOWS WE ARE IN A VERY UNCERTAIN SITUATION. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT CONGRESS WILL COME THROUGH WITH EVEN MORE AID THAN WE ARE EXPECTING. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE ECONOMY CAN RECOVER MORE ROBUSTLY- DAN OUR- ECONOMIC EXPERTS ARE. PROJECTING BUT IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE THAT ALL THESE NUMBERS COULD BE EVEN WORSE THAN WE ARE PROJECTING RIGHT NOW SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO PREPARE FOR THAT POSSIBILITY. AND WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT A BUDGET THAT ADDS SEVERAL BILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL DEFICITS. IN THOSE OUT YEARS. AND THAT BRINGS ME TO MY LAST POINT WHICH IS THE CONTENT OF THE TRIGGER POTS- THAT MR PADDOCK MENTIONED. WELL WE ARE ALL HOPEFUL THAT CONGRESS WILL GET ITS ACT TOGETHER AND PASS A PACKAGE THAT PROVIDES. MUCH GREATER STATE AND LOCAL AID WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT THEY WILL NOT COME THROUGH IN WASHINGTON DC. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THE CONTENT OF THE TRIGGER CUTS ARE ONE TIME IN NATURE WHETHER THEY ARE CAUTIOUS OR DIGITAL USES OF RESERVES. THOSE ARE AREAS THAT WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE IN THE YEAR AFTER THE BUDGET YEAR. WHICH COULD FORCES TO RESERVE ON. CHOICES ON WHAT WE'RE ALREADY SEEING ON THE LEGISLATURE AND ON THE GO. SO THE ARE SOME CONCERNS BUT I WANT TO REITERATE. WE THE POINTS AND CON. WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO IN THE DAYS AHEAD TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT I'M GONNA OPEN UP FOR. CUT QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEE MISTER MISTER COOPER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THIS IS FOR- FINANCE. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN MANY LISTEN LEGISLATURE INCLUDING MYSELF INTO EXTENSIVE NEGOTIATIONS TO EXTENDOUR CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM WHICH BECAME AB THREE NINETY EIGHT AND CREATE A PROGRAM THAT INSURED WE WOULD MEET OUR GOALS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES. PROVIDE COST CONTAINMENT MEASURES TO ENSURE INDUSTRIES WHEN THE FORCE OF THE STATE. NOW WITHOUT ANY POLICY COMMITTEE HEARING OR PUBLIC INPUT LANGUAGES BEEN SHOVED IN THE BUDGET THAT WOULD REOPEN THE AGREEMENTS WE WORK SO HARD. THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD JUST FINALIZE REGULATIONS FOR CAP AND TRADE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND THEY ARE FULLY IMPLEMENTED UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY ONE. YET ALL THE STUDIES DONE BY CAR SHOW OF THE PROGRAM IS WORKING TO MEET OUR GHG REDUCTION GOALS. SO WHAT THE SEARCH IS REQUIRED TO THIS POINT- WE VOTE ON THIS BACK THREE YEARS AGO WAS A TWO THIRDS VOTE. AND A LOT OF US- VOTER SUPPORT IT WAS TOUGH WE HAD GOTTEN THE MOST WE MADE IT HAPPEN. AND NOW WE'VE PASSAGE CHANGES ON A FORTY ONE VOTE BILL. SO YOU KNOW WHAT'S IN THE THIS IS STILL IN PROCESS. BUT I'D LIKE TO GET AN ANSWER ON THAT SIMPLIFICATION PLEASE. YES THANK YOU SOMEONE MEMBER COOPER- I THINK I'LL MAKE ONE OR TWO BRIEF COMMENTS AND THEN MY COLLEAGUE TO RESET CALPERS IS ON THE PHONE AND SHE SHOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. ADDITIONAL DETAIL AS WELL- I THINK THAT WE ALL SAW THAT THAT CAP AND TRADE MOST RECENT AUCTION- CAME WELL WELL BELOW. THE PROJECTIONS THAT WE HAD INITIALLY HOPED FOR AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR- SO BOTH FOR THE END OF THIS YEAR AS WELL AS THE COMING YEAR- WE REALIZE THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PROGRAM BECAUSE- THE ABILITY TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAMS THAT WE SUPPORTED. THIS YEAR I WILL NOT BE PRESENT NEXT YEAR BUT LET ME TURN IT OVER TO RESET TO ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION MORE DETAILS. HI GOOD MORNING THE TO TREAT THE COVER WAS. PART OF FINANCE. CORRECT THAT LEGISLATURE. BUDGET THAT INCLUDE. A NEW PROVISION. THAT BUT THE- THAT. THERE IS. FUNDING FOR THEIR- RESEARCH BOARD YOU CAN. A HOME. CONSIDER CHAIN. THAT AND TRADE PROGRAM BUT- THIS WAS PART OF THE LARGEST. ACTS THAT. MAY WERE. HAD CHANGES TO. I'D CONTROL SECTION THAT. ADDRESS WHAT MISTER. BUT REFER. TO IT WHICH IS THE RUNNING INTO. IN BUDGET. SUPPOSED DON'T. ON THE CABIN TRADE BETTER DECLINE IN THE- LIKE IT'S- PACK. HAVE BEEN. BUT THERE IS. THAT. IN A LANGUAGE THAT DOES AFTER FOR AN THEIR RESOURCES FOR THE MAKING. BUT BUT THEY CAN ALSO ARE YOU UP RULED WHEN THEY THEY APPROVED. UNDER A THREE NINETY EIGHT WHAT WE DIRECT THE MAKE AND RULE MAY BECAUSE CHANGE. IS THERE ABOUT A THREE YEAR IMPLEMENT. I'M NOT OF THE- PROPOSAL IS NOT PART OF OUR REVISION PROPOSAL BECAUSE IT OF A LOT. BUDGET PACKAGE. YEAH SO THE- PROPOSAL VERY WITH REGARD TO NEXT YEAR AT PAYS YOU MACINNES FOR THE PRO. BUT I BELIEVE THIS. AT PROPOSED CHANGE THAT YOU'RE- ARE NOT OF THE IN THE- PACKAGE TO. IN OTHER OTHER ISSUES. WITH SAY BUDGET CRISIS WE FOR TO CRISIS IS ONE HELL AND ONE ECHO. THIS IS ON THE ARE PORSCHE THEY ARE IN THE TAX. REMOVING IT WE'RE LITTLE TO ON THE SCIENCES INDUSTRY TO THE ARE IN THE TO SOLVE OUR HEALTH. AND WE TO PAY UPON LIFE SCIENCES AN ERROR IN THIS. FOR THE JOB TO GO US OUT OF THIS ECONOMIC PROBLEMS SO WAS. YOU KNOW MORE THAN EVER WE HAVE THAT. SO LIKE THE ARE IN THE THIS NOW FOR THE FOLKS. YES ARE HERE A HARPER REFER TO THE TEMP. SUSPENSION OF CORRECT OKAY SO I THAT WE UNDERSTAND AND- YOU KNOW THIS NOT. EASY AND THERE SHORT TERM YOU KNOW THIS WILL GO ON FOR TWO YEARS. A I DO. TO RAISE THAT THESE CRIED WILL. TO BE AT THE AFTER THREE YEARS PATTERSON TO STAND AT A CERTAIN THINGS WILL EXPIRE YOU KNOW FOR AND WELLS WE ARE A EXTENSION. SO THAT THIS CREDIT THANKS WE CAN BE. I THINK THAT PROVIDE. SOME CERTAINTY TO THE PEOPLE WHO HAPPENS TO ENTITIES HAVE THOSE. A WE RELY ON SO WE LIKE IN FOR AND WE DO BUT IT IS A REASONABLE WAY TO GO THROUGH THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS WHILE CONTINUING TO INCENTIVIZE KIND OF. SINCE ABOUT. THE CITY NOW. A MOVIE IMPACT THESE POTENTIAL. HAVE PUBLIC SAY. IN THE CITY SO SEE SEE I PROGRAM. ENGINE DO NOT HAVE THIS WITH THE FIFTH. YES ON THERE I'VE GOT A LIKE A AND WERE ON THE LAW YOU KNOW WE DO A AS YOU KNOW SO WELL AS PROGRAM. COMMITMENTS AND OF CURRENT TRENDS HOLD CLOSE TO FACILITIES OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF BUT ONE AT AREA ADDRESS THAT. HI LARRY WAS WITH DEPART FIVE. SO WITH RESPECT TO THE BECAUSE THERE'S A- CUT TO FACT THERE ONE IS. WE JUST HAVE A FRIEND OF REDUCE COURT CAN COMMITMENTS SO WE'RE GETTING PEOPLE THE STATE PER FROM A COURT IS WHAT WE SEE IN RECENT YEARS. ARE WE ARE ARE. TAKING STEPS. SAFELY REDUCE THE PRESENT WITH. THAT THESE THINGS ARE WITH OUR PRIOR TO THE NUMBER. AND CREATING STATE PAP RE AND FOR INDIVIDUALS BACK AND THE COMMUNITY DEPARTMENT HAS BACK TO GREAT AND WE YEARS. IN BOLSTERING ITS APERTURE READABLE SO I WOULD THAT WE'RE AND OF BRINGING DOWN ON PRESENT TO PASS IS BEING DONE IN CONSISTENT WITH APOLLO SAFETY OR ANY UP AND I'M BESIDE THE IMPORTANCE REASONABLE AND PREPARE PEOPLE TO SAFELY GRAY AFTER BUT I. ELSE COME BACK AND ON THEIR ABILITY PART AND WE KNOW THAT CDC'S REAL BIG YOUR BILL TATIAN IS RECENT AS AN IN THE FIFTH PERCENT AND EVEN THOUGH MY FOCUS THE COUNTY JAIL NOW THE MINISTER AND NO OF THE STATE HAS AN IDEA WHAT THOSE ARE FOR JAIL WHO LESS WAITING OF PERCENT SO THAT'S THAT'S TROUBLING FOR ME. AND HOW DO YOU FOR DISPLAY ESSENTIAL STAFF WHO HAVE ON THE FRONTLINE OF THE PANDA. EXCUSE ME AND RISKING THEIR LIVES WHO WILL BE BE OF A JOB. ALL THIS TOUCH VERY BRIEFLY THAT AN ERROR MAY ONE TO. GO FIRST OPTION AND ALL THESE CASES IS ALLOW TO A NEARBY FOR SO OR FOR SO WHERE THEY ANOTHER MATCH ON WE UNDER THAT IN ANY. OF STATE AND CITY OR FOR CELL THERE WILL BE WORD AND ALWAYS THE FIRST ON IS GIVE THE- OF THAT TRAINED TO AND FOR BUT THAT COULD SPEAK MORE DETAIL ON THAT. SO AT THE WHAT I CALL THAT COLLEAGUE ACTUALLY COVER THAT QUITE WHILE I MEAN I THINK THE- TO. THAT WHEN WE DO DOWN THE ARE PRISON CAPACITY THAT WILL HAVE OFFERED. GIVEN THE NON OF TURN VACANCY. THAT WE HAVE IN THE DEPARTMENT WHERE THE IMPACT THAT EMPLOY. WHAT THE BILL TO OTHER PARTS WE IT TOOK. THE BY THE END OF THE GIVEN THE NUMBER VACANCIES WITH THE WANT NEED TO BE SIGNIFICANT WHY ARE BUT. WE ARE TURNING CLOSELY TRACK THAT I THINK THAT. HERE OF A LOT MEN OF THE IMPACT A- STATE PLATES. IMPLICIT BIAS. RACIAL PROFILING COMMITTEE POLICING. CULTURAL DIVERSITY IN ORGANIZATIONAL WELLNESS THESE ARE ALL HOT TOPICS IN A LOT OF WHAT'S GOING ON THE PAST WEEK. IN CALIFORNIA CROSS A NATION. HOW EFFECTIVE IS THIS IS LEARNING IF YOU'RE DOING. USE OF FORCE IN THE ESCALATION LOOKING AT A COMPUTER VERSES IN THE PAST. THAT'S BEEN CLASSROOM LEARNING HANDS ALL DEALING WITH FOLKS. SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO THE RATIONALE IN DOING THAT BECAUSE WE GO. WHEN YOU'RE SEEING IN DOING IT YOU RETAIN MORE. THAN SITTING IN FOR A COMPUTER. AND LIKE I SAID ON THE GOVERNOR IS STILL A QUICKLY ON TV. THAT HE SUPPORTS THESE. AND YET. IN THIS BUDGET. THEY WANT A DISTANCE LEARNING WHICH I THINK IS NOT GOOD FOR THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE THEY WANT TO HAVE THE OFFICERS TRAINED TO THE BEST LEVEL POSSIBLE. MR MINNICH'S TRAINING SO HOW DO YOU RATIONALIZE. YES FIRST OF AS A MEMBER CAREER ON RIGHT THAT THE LAST COUPLE DAYS HAVE YOU KNOW REAR FOR. READER THE OF THESE PROGRAM AND HOW WE NEED DONE I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO THE TESTING ONE NEXT THAT FOR IMAGE. FIRST WAS OUR TO IT IN THE FACT THAT LOT OF THE PRO LOOKING AT FOR NEXT YOU KNOW WHAT WE WHAT WE SEE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE MIND WE WEREN'T. HOW WOULD BE TO BRING PEOPLE TO SIGN. OR WHATEVER THESE TRAININGS TAKE PLACE TO SAME EXTENT WE GET INTO. BACK AND- THAT BEING SAID WE UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN THE FLAG YOU KNOW THE IS CERTAINLY AT THE TOP OF THE AGENDA FOR A OF US I THINK OF THAT COUPLE DAYS AND AS WE THINK ABOUT WHERE WE WILL. THIS TRAIN TO GO AND FUNDS TO BE SPENT THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO INTO. AND TO GO OKAY ON THAT IF WE BEACH. AND THIS IS THE IS NOT FOR THIS I TAUGHT A OUR CULTURAL CAN MAKE. IN THEIR CLASSROOM HEARING FROM YOUR PEERS AND HAVE THAT DIRECT IN. BACK AND FORTH. THAT IS HELPS TREMENDOUSLY VERSUS ABOUT PEWTER WHO KNOWS WAS PAYING IT OR NOT. ALSO ON THE WHO WERE SITTING MONEY ON THE YOU'LL THE PRO. AND SHIFTING IT TO MEDICARE ANOTHER INSURANCE. AND LET MY BIG CONCERN IS MEDI CAL IS FUNDED A LOT OF FOLKS TAKE ME I'LL- AND WE'RE PER PEACEFUL BACK FROM STREETS ARE RISK. SO I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THESE MIL WE'LL FOLKS ARE HIGH RISK. AND HOW EFFECTIVE WAS BE. YOU KNOW MEDI CAL IS ALWAYS BEEN ISSUE SO WE'RE GONNA SHIFT HIGH RISK INDIVIDUALS ON THE MEDI CAL. YEAH SO WHEN IT COMES TO THIS THIS IS. TED SIMPLY RESPONSE TO THE BUDGET PRESSURES THAT WERE FACING SOME ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS THAT YOU'RE RAISING AND JUST NEED TO FIGURE OUTSIDE OF WORK FOR SALUTE WE CAN'T BE MONEY OVER PEOPLE'S. SAFETY IN LIFE AND I WERE TALKING THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE OUT SO THAT THE INMATES ARE TRYING TO. GET BACK IN BUT MILLIS IS VERY TOUGH TO OVERCOME. WHICH MEANS THE TOUGH TO OVERCOME ON THAT IN. BUT I JUST CAN'T. RECONCILE THAT MONEY OVER SAFETY THAT THEY MAY SAY TO YOU- AND WITH IT INDIVIDUAL SAFETY AND ALSO PUBLIC SAFETY AT SOME POINT I MEAN WE'RE NOT TALKING A LOT OF MONEY HERE. INTRODUCTION BUT A POINT ONE MILLION IN SAVING IT'S JUST LITTLE THINGS LIKE ANY PROVIDER. CAN AND SHOULD DO A BETTER WITH THAT I BELIEVE THAT'S. ALL I HAVE FOR NOW THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS COOPER MISSED. FOR THE BILL OF YOU VERY MUCH THAT'S A BUMMER FINANCE I NIGHT I NINE AND THAT THE KIT CAP TRADE PROPOSAL I GUESS WAS PUSHED BY LET'S I ALWAYS THAT THE NEW FROM THE BUT INTO OF THE ROOM MAKING I JUST WANT TO GET SOME CLEAR IN TERMS OF THE ANSWER WOULD PROVIDE THE FOLK. I GUESS FROM THE ANSWER PROVIDED BY THE BY THE PART BY AS IS THAT IS N REVENUE BUT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WHEN WE NEGOTIATED- CAP AND TRADE AND TO FOLLOW UP ON WHAT MISTER COOPER TALKED ABOUT THE OBJECTIVE OF THE CAPITATE PROGRAM WAS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS IT WASN'T A REVENUE GENERATING PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED TO JUST GENERATE REVENUE CONTINUOUS THESE CORRECT GENERALLY IT THE REASON THAT WE DISCUSS REVENUES SIMPLY BECAUSE WE'RE PUTTING FORWARD THAT BUDGET PLAN- BUT CERTAINLY THE IDEA BEHIND CAPTAIN TRADERS TO STEP AWAY REDUCE THE NOT BE- EMISSIONS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OKAY SO THEN IT IS. THERE'S AN UNDERSTANDING. THAT THAT. IF INTRIGUED BECOME IS EFFECTIVE AND- WOULD. THAT THAT THE MATTER REVENUE WILL PROBABLY TAKE OVER TIME. CORRECT CERTAINLY OVER OR TIME ALTHOUGH THE CAP ALSO DECLINES OVER TIME SO THEIR NUMBER OF SHIFTING DYNAMICS- IN THE IN THE CAP AND TRADE MARKET. RIGHT SO. I GUESS I'M I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS RULE MAKING- IS THAT WHY SHOULD. THIS BE DONE IN THEBUDGET WE SHOULD WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER. DONE THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. ESPECIALLY IF. BY BY REDESIGNING CAP AND TRADE AND- AND IF THE IF THE IF THE GOAL IS. EMISSIONS AND NOT REVENUES THEN THAT WILL LEAD TO A DIFFERENT- I GUESS A DIFFERENT. DID WE DECIDE BUT YOU CAN'T INCREASE REVENUES IN CAP AND TRADE WITOUT. DIRECTLY INCREASING THE COSTS. TO CALIFORNIANS WHEN WRITTEN AT LEAST WITH INTERVIEW AND IN RELATIONSHIP TO- GAS PRICES UTILITY BILLS TO YOU KNOW WHATEVER COSTS. INTO THE GENERATING ENERGY- SO I'M JUST SO I UNDERSTAND. THE REDESIGN WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER DONE- THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND NOT TO THE BUDGET. SO I CAN'T SPEAK WITH TO THAT BECAUSE IT'S SO. PROPOSAL IN AND WAS NOT OF THAT NEIGHBOR THAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED LAST MONTH- I THINK GENERALLY FOR THE BUDGET YOU KNOW WE ARE FOCUSED ON- THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED REVENUES. NEXT YEAR WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE OUR PAY AS YOU GO MACINNES THEM I WILL SAY THAT- WHILE THAT PRIMARY PURPOSE A CAP AND TRADE IS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS OVERTIME. AT THE REVENUE GENERATED BY THOSE PROGRAMS- DOES FIND SOME PRETTY IMPORTANT INITIATIVES FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S PERSPECTIVE AND WE SAW IN OUR PROPOSAL TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THOSE THAT WE BELIEVE ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT SUCH AS COMMITTEE- PROTECTION- FORCED A WILDFIRE SAFETY. AND SAID IN A PORTABLE DRINKING WATER SO WE ARE COGNIZANT OF THE FACT THAT- WHILE THE REVENUE CAN VARY OVER TIME THEIR NUMBER OP IMPORTANT PROGRAMS- THAT YOU RELY ON THAT FUNDING BUT I'D BEYOND THAT I DON'T WANT TO APPLY SPECIFICALLY ON THE LEGISLATIVE. SINCE IT WAS NOT IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD DO YOU KNOW IF THE THAT THE LANGUAGE OF THE PROPOSAL IS PERMISSIVE SO IF IT HAPPENS TO BE THAT HERE BE. ANALYZES THE CHANGES FINDS OF TO BE DETRIMENTAL TO RATEPAYERS ARE TO CALIFORNIA'S ARE TO COME TO ENTITIES ARE INVOLVED IN THE PROGRAM THAT WOULD IF THEY CHOSE TO CLOSE THE RULE MAKING WITH ACTION IS THAT POSSIBLE. I'D HAVE. TO DOUBLE CHECK ON THAT QUESTION. OKAY AT MID MAY THIS IS A THAT I AM IF WANTED TO. AT THE TIME AND IS. IT DO THEY HAVE PURSUE. ON PROPOSED. IS THIS AN ERROR THAT. SHOULD GO THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND NOT THROUGH THE BUDGET. AND OVERLOOKED. OH SORRY. IF YOU START COME UP TO JUST LOOK TALKING YEAH I KNOW I THINK I WOULD ALSO NEED TO CHECK WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON THAT PARTICULAR QUESTION. I MEAN I THINK WHETHER OR NOT YOU WOULD WANT TO DO IT THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IS REALLY A DECISION FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE I MEAN IT- PROVOCATIVE WHETHER YOU WANT TO DO IT THROUGH THE LEGEND THE- THE POLICY PROCESS OR THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS. IS THE MEAN IS IT IS IT MY INTERPRETATION CORRECT THAT THAT A LOOK IF THE BUDGET- LANGUAGE. WHO DIRECTS THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO CONDUCT RULE MAKING THAT WERE RELINQUISHING OUR ABILITY TO. BASICALLY REVIEW AND REDESIGNED CAP AND TRADE I WAS PUT THE LEGISLATURE NEGOTIATED YEARS AGO AND WE'RE GIVING THAT POWER TO AN AGENCY WOULDN'T IS A MY INTERPRETATION CORRECT INCORRECT AND IN THAT AND IN THIS MANNER. WELL I'M NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE THAT WILL THEM TO MY KNOWLEDGE THAT THAT THAT LANGUAGES AND NOT FINALIZED AT THIS POINT SO I'D BE RELUCTANT TO. SAY ONE WAY OR THE OTHER BUT THERE'S ACT MY GUESS IS THAT THAT CONCERNED THOUGH. POSSIBLE ATTENTION EIGHT PASSING OKAY NINE I THINK THAT AND THAT I THINK THAT'S MY OF MY PERSPECTIVE IS MY CONCERN AND I AND I CAN ECHO WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER- YOU COOPER SAID IS THAT. A SO MUCH HEARTACHE AND SO MUCH EFFORT WENT INTO CAP AND TRADE OR WELL I WASN'T I DON'T GET THEIR OTHER MEMBERS DID AND INTO IS TO NOW SOMEHOW. HAVE AN AGENCY BE ASKED TO CONDUCT RULE MAKING AT A TIME WHEN THAT PROBABLY SHOULD BE WITHIN THE PURVIEW THE LEGISLATURE I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER MOORE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN A UNLESS LIKE TO PIGGY BACK ON MISTER COOPER MISTER FARMS QUESTIONS ABOUT CAP AND TRADE BECAUSE I THINK MOST OF THE PEOPLE ON THE DíAS HERE WERE OF MEMBERS THE LEGISLATURE WHEN THAT PACKAGE WAS NEGOTIATED AND I WE- WE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR THE PURPOSE OF CAP AND TRADE IS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND THEY REVENUE THAT RAISE THAT GETS RAISED IS KIND OF AN ANCILLARY BENEFIT FROM THE STATE'S PERSPECTIVE SO IT REALLY KIND OF ANGERS ME. TO HEAR THE PART IN A FINANCIAL PINE THAT WE NEED TO MAKE CHANGES STRUCTURALLY TO THE PROGRAM BECAUSE IT'S NOT RAISING OF REVENUE- YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT WE'RE SELLING FEWER THAN THE NUMBER OF EMISSIONS ALLOWANCES THAT WE HAVE ON THE MARKET IS A GOOD THING IT MEANS THAT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ARE DECLINING AND- THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK WE SHOULD CELEBRATE AND NOT TRY TO FIX- I HAD A QUESTION FOR THE LA- ABOUT THAT BECAUSE WE I DON'T THINK WE CAN FORGET. YOU KNOW WHAT BEFORE FOR MOVE OFF THE TOPIC IT OVER TO OKAY THE PROGRAMS A GIFT OUT OF CARE AND TRADE REVENUES YOU ONE OF THEM IS HIGH SPEED RAIL GOT A 20% STATURE TO APPROPRIATION FROM THAT THOSE FUNDS EVERY YEAR AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THAT IS ONE PROGRAM AMONG ALL THESE COPS ALL BUT CERTAIN PEOPLE AND. WE'RE WE'RE SO ON THIS DIET. ABOUT TO EDUCATION TALKED TELECOM TO HELPING SERVICE. YOU KNOW HOW RIGHT NOW SPEED RAIL IS COMPLETE UNTOUCHED. SO IF YOU WANT TO SUGGESTION A PROBE. THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE IF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM IS HURTING. FOR MAYBE THAT'S WHAT WE ON A LOW AT OUR POSTER ONE I JUST WANT. ONE VERY QUICKLY I BELIEVE THAT. THE ALTHOUGH I MAYBE MISSED. I BELIEVE IS A- PROPOSAL FOR REGARDING AT HOW TO RESPOND IF THERE IS LESS REVENUE THAN WE ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED. BUT I BELIEVE THAT WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO A IS IN FACT A LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE NOT YET. YEAH ABSOLUTELY I WILL I'M AWARE OF THAT I'M NOT GOING TO BEAT UP ON YOU ABOUT THAT THE DIET WAS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IT JUST OPINED. IN ANSWERING MISTER COOPER'S QUESTION. YOU KNOW THAT THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE PROGRAM WAS TO CREATE REVENUE AND THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT GOT ME GOING I'M SORRY. IF I IF YOU HEARD THAT I THAT'S NOT. WE UNDERSTAND THAT I'M REPURPOSE OKAY HAPPEN TRADE IS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF A MISSION. AND I WANT TO GOOD HERE. I ALSO MIND EVERY. THAT IT THAT IS EIGHT. THAT WE HAVE CREATED FOR THESE. MISSIONS ALLOWANCES AND IN ALSO PARK FREE MARKET. APPLY HERE. PART OF THE WITH THE- LEGISLATURE'S PROPOSAL HERE. IS TO RAISE THE FLOOR PRICE. FOR THESE ALLOWANCES AND SO I HAVE A QUESTION FOR MR PADDOCK YOU GIVEN THAT THIS IS A FREE MARKET SITUATION WOULDN'T RAISING THE FLOOR PROGRESS. RESULT IN FEWER ALLOWANCES. SOLD TIONS. IT'S NOT A- I SEE WHAT. TO THE MARKET. THE I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE A REASONABLE INTERPRETATION. OKAY LET'S HOME ON THE MARKET IS THAT IF WE MOVE FOR WITH THIS PER. WHICH I THINK CAME OVER FROM THIS IN WE ARE NOT GUARANTEED THAT THIS GOING TO PRODUCE MORE REVS AT MY PRETTY ROUTE LIE REVENUE IF YOU RAISE THE PRICE OF SOMETHING PEOPLE BUY LESS OF IT AND SO I THINK TO ASSUME THE JUST RAISING THE FOR PRICE IS GOING TO RESULT IN THE RESTORATION OF THE FUNDING TO THE PROGRAMS IN THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM I THINK THAT THAT'S FOOLISH. I'M WELL I GOT YOU MISTER PATRICK- I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT. THE FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY OF SOME OF THE THINGS LEGISLATURE'S PROPOSING TO DO IN THIS BUDGET SO- WHEN WE FIRST WERE EXAMINING THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE I EXPRESSED SOME CONCERNS ABOUT. THE AMOUNT OF. THEIR PHONE BORROWING- THE GOVERNOR HE PROPOSED OVER TEN BILLION DOLLARS OF INTER FUND BORROWING THAT MONEY'S GOT TO BE PAID BACK. WE'RE BORROWING FROM FUNDS WITH RESTRICTED USES PUTTING THAT MONEY THE GENERAL FUND. AND WE HAVE TO PAY THAT MONEY BACK IN THE FUTURE SO I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE GOING TO BE UNDER THE LEGISLATURE'S PROPOSAL. BORROWING OVER A BILLION DOLLARS MORE- ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF DEFERRALS I MEAN OBVIOUSLY TO FOR OVER JUST PAYING MONEY WILL. WORK JUST PAYING OUR BILLS A DAY LATE SO WE CAN SAY THAT THEIR NEXT YEAR'S BILLS. INSTEAD OF THIS YEAR'S BILLS THAT MIGHT HELP US THIS YEAR DOES NOT HELP US NEXT YEAR MAKES THINGS WORSE. SO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN DEFERRALS- WE'RE DOUBLING DOWN ON THAT GIMMICK WE WANT TO- IF THE FEDERAL TRIGGERED. GETS AN ACTED WE WANT TO BORROW OVER-TEN. BILLION DOLLARS AND DEFERRALS. SO I I'M I'M WONDERING BECAUSE MISTER. THIS ONE EATEN UP. RAISE THE POINT IN HIS OPENING. THAT THAT WE'RE ALL CONCERNED ABOUT LONG TERM STRUCTURAL BUDGET DEFICITS HERE IN THESE THINGS THAT. WE'RE PROPOSING TO DO THE BUDGET MAKE THAT PROBLEM WORSE NOT BETTER SO- IN YOUR OPINION IS THIS OR IS IT OR IS RESPONSIBLE STEPS TO TAKE. I THERE'S A- OF. I WOULD MAY ABOUT INTEREST. TO THAT MR OBERNOLTE. THE FIRST IS THAT THE STATE IS LIKELY TO BE FACING A STRUCTURAL PROBLEM UNDER ALMOST ANY OF THE SCENARIOS THAT. ARE WE ARE ALL CONSIDERING TODAY. UNDER THE MAY REVISION UNDER THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE. AND UNDER THIS SCENARIO IN WHICH WE EVEN GET ADDITIONAL FEDERAL ASSISTANCE MOST LIKELY ALMOST CERTAINLY THAT FEDERAL ASSISTANCE WOULD BE LIMITED TERM IN NATURE ONE OR TWO YEARS AT THE MOST AND SO. AT THAT POINT THERE COULD BE ADDITIONAL- STRUCTURAL PRESSURE ON THE BUDGET. I THINK AS MISTER MISS WHEN A THIN SAID- BUT YOU KNOW HE'S CORRECT THAT- THAT- THE- YOU KNOW THE FUTURE. BUDGET OUTLOOK IS THAT TERE IS NOT A- YOU KNOW. BASED ON OUR CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS IN WHAT WE HAVE WITH THE INFORMATION WE HAVE TODAY. THERE WOULD BE A BUDGET PROBLEM IN THE OUT YEARS- IT. UNDER PRETTY MUCH ANY OF THESE SCENARIOS SO WITH THAT SAID. THEN THE QUESTION IS- I THINK ONE OF BALANCE IN WHAT I HAVE SORT OF THE LEGISLATIVE. COLLECTIVELY WHAT'S THE LEGISLATURE'S RISK TOLERANCE AND TO THE EXTENT YOU USE MORE OF THE ONE TIME RESOURCES NOW. IT DOES- REDUCE PROBABLY THE HUMAN TOLL THAT IS BEING TAKEN BY THE EFFECTS OF THE COVERT NINETEEN AND THE RECESSION. ON PEOPLE THAT ARE- BENEFICIARIES OF STATE PROGRAMS SO YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S- CLEARLY ONE CONSIDERATION BUT THEN ON THE ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOUR VIEW IS THAT THE ECONOMY WILL STILL BE IN IT YOU KNOW DEPRESSED CONDITION NEXT YEAR AT THIS TIME. WE WILL HAVE FEWER- ONE TIME RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO US AND THEN MORE ONGOING TYPES OF SOLUTIONS WOULD THEN BE NECESSARY. IF ON THE OTHER HAND YOU FELT THAT THE ECONOMY IS- ITS JUST AT SOME LEVEL REACHING- TROUGH HERE IN THE IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS AND THAT WE WILL BEGIN TO RECOVER AND BY NEXT YEAR AT THIS TIME THE ECONOMY IS IN A- MUCH MORE OF A GROWTH MODE. THOSE KIND OF SOLUTIONS WOULD BE LESS LESS NEEDED BUT I DON'T THINK ANY OF US KNOW AT THIS TIME WHAT THAT WILL WHAT THAT WILL LOOK LIKE- AND SO TO SOME EXTENT IT REALLY EPENDS I THINK ON YOUR- WILLINGNESS TO ASSUME THAT SOME AMOUNT OF RISK. ABOUT THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AT THIS POINT. THANK YOU ARE YOU KNOW I JUST WANT EVERYONE TO FOCUS ON THE AMOUNT OF RISK THAT WE'RE CONSIDERING TAKING HERE WE'RE TALKING AT TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS. EVEN WHEN THINGS WERE GOING WELL WE HAD ABOUT A SIX BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET SURPLUS THIS YEAR THAT WAS A BACK IN JANUARY I MEAN THAT MEANS THAT IF AT THAT LEVEL OF ECONOMIC GROWTH IT WOULD TAKE US THREE AND A HALF YEARS TO PAY THAT MONEY BACK- AND IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A SNORT. WE DON'T HAVE ECONOMIC GROWTH THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE THE THAT'S GOING TO TAKE EVEN LONGER AND THAT'S JUST A ONE YEAR PROBLEM IF YOU'RE ASSUME IF YOU'RE- ASSUMING THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT AS BOTH THE ONLY WHEN THE DEAL AFTER. PROJECT FOR THIS YEAR I MEAN THE WE'RE GOING TO BE. BE BACK NEXT YEAR WE'RE TO KICK THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD THE WAS JUST GONNA BIGGER SAY THAT'S MIKE ABOUT THAT AND LAST BUT FOR MISTER THIS ONE EITHER YOU KNOW BUT SENATE OPENING ABOUT. YOU TALK ABOUT OPTIMISM THAT. FEDERAL WOULD ACT AND WILL PROVIDE ADDITION. FEDERAL FUNDING PENDANT ACOSTA IT'S- AND I'M ON IF YOU COULD ALLOW A LITTLE BIT A WHAT LEVEL OF. IS THAT THE GOING TO. ASK I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE A GREAT AUNT TO THAT. I WOULD SAY IN THE LAST DAYS WE'VE SO HOPEFUL SIGNALS OUR PARTNER AND WATCH DC. AND IT DOES THAT SOME KIND OF PATH DOES TO BE MOVING PERHAPS ON A MORE BIPARTISAN BASIS THEN WE MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. THAT BEING SAID AT THE REASON ARMY REVISION- STARTS WITH THE TRIGGER CUTS IF THE FUNDING IT DOES NOT COME IN ON JULY FIRST IS BECAUSE- THE GOVERNOR'S BELIEF WAS A WASTE WHEN HE PUT UP IN A REVISION ON MAY FOURTEENTH. THAT WHILE WE ARE HOPING AND PUSHING FOR CONGRESSIONAL ACTION WE COULDN'T COUNT ON IT AT THAT TIME THE SIGNALS IN THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS HAVE CERTAINLY GOTTEN BETTER BUT- AT THIS POINT I WOULD STILL DESCRIBE THIS IS VERY CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC. OKAY I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT- I'M I'M A LITTLE MORE PESSIMISTIC THAN YOU ARE ONLY BECAUSE LOOKING AT THE CONGRESSIONAL CALENDAR IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE- THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ONLY IN SESSION THIRTEEN DAYS BETWEEN NOW AND THE TRIGGER DATE THAT THE LEGISLATURE SET UP OF THE FIRST OF SEPTEMBER. SO THAT'S IMPLIED HAVE REALLY SHORT TIME HORIZON TO ENACT SUCH A MOMENTOUS PIECE OF LEGISLATION SO I WILL CERTAINLY FIND OUT BUT I WANNA CAUTIOUS ALL OF CAUTION ALL OF US THAT. THE PRETENDING THAT THIS IS GOING TO THE PRETENDING THERE'S A HOW 2% CHANCE OF THIS HAPPENING IS VERY ANALYZE. RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. I THINK YOU WERE GONNA GOODNESS MCCARTY NEXT. THE YOU AND MISTER CHAIR I I'VE SERIES OF HERE BUT I THINK I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT EVERY VOTE WE TAKE UP HERE IS A RISK AND REWARD WE HAVE TO ANALYZE THE DOWNSIDES. AND OF COURSE THE UP SIDES AND I DON'T KNOW WE CAN CONSIDER THIS A PURITY TEST FOR AN AUSTERITY BUDGET WHEN WE LOOK AT THE FLIP SIDE BECAUSE- THIS ISN'T A TYPICAL RECESSION. WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST FEW DECADES THIS IS ONE THAT WAS BORN BY S. LITERALLY TURNING OFF THE ECONOMY SO IF WE WANT TO GET PEOPLE BACK TO WORK GET CONSUMER SPENDING BACK GOING GETTING OUR R. HEALTHCARE NETWORK- WORKING PROPERLY AS DOCTOR ARAMBULA SAID THESE ARE CHOICES WE HAVE TO MAKE SO- KEEPING THE STATE OF FLOAT. AND KEEPING OUR SYSTEMS OF LOW THAT MAKE CALIFORNIA AT WORK AND HAVE PEOPLE GO BACK TO WORK IS A CHOICE WE'RE MAKING- SO I THINK THAT YOU HAVE TO ALSO LOOK AT THE FLIP SIDE IF WE DIDN'T MAKE THESE CHOICES. OURS IS OUR ECONOMY GONNA BE FLOUNDERING FOR YEARS DOWN THE ROAD I THINK DURING LAST RECESSION WHENEVER NOTABLE ECONOMISTS AS OUR OUR BUDGETARY REMINDS US FROM- UC BERKELEY% DOCTOR D'ANDREA TYSON TALKED ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. STYLIST WAS WELL ABLE TO RE. US QUICKLY WE MAY SO MUCH DRACONIAN CUTS TO ALL PROGRAMS THAT JUST YOU KNOW KEEP CALIFORNIA. SO I THINK WE JUST BE MINDFUL ABOUT THAT THE CHOICES WE MAKE. YOU KNOW FOCUS ON THE BIG PICTURE AS WELL I DO HAVE. A FEW QUESTIONS I WANT TO START RIGHT HERE WITH MY OWN DISTRICT- THE STATE CAPITAL OF COURSE- BIG PART OF OUR CONSTITUENCY OUR OUR STATE WORKERS. AND IN THE PROPOSAL IN IN- IN THE MAY REVISED YOU PUSH FOR THAT AT THAT 10% POTENTIAL- CUT TO. STATE WORKER SALARY IN IT WOULD GENERATE A ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION. I THINK WE PULL BACK A LITTLE BIT OUR BUDGET DOESN'T DOESN'T- AS ALIEN NOTES DOESN'T ASSUME THAT AMOUNT AND- WOULD- PUT TIS TO THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS I THINK THE- THE LOCAL ENTITIES. LED BY S. C. ONE THOUSAND. ARE TALKING ABOUT OTHER WAYS TO HAVE TO HELP THE STATE AND THIS IS LOW PREMATURE TO BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WE'RE GETTING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO HELP US BRIDGE NEXT COUPLE YOURSELF. ONE OF DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE COULD AND LIGHTNESS WE'RE AT WITH OUR STATE WORKERS. YES SO I CAN ONLY SPEAK ON IT VERY AT GENERAL LEVEL I'LL MAKE TWO POINTS I THINK NUMBER ONE OUR POSITION- IS ALSO WITH REGARD TO THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS THAT THAT IS WHERE WE DO WANT TO. ACHIEVE THOSE SAVINGS SO FOR THAT 10% OF REDUCTION- THAT'S ASSUMED IN THE BUDGET BUT IN TERMS OF HOW IT GETS DONE- WE ARE HOPING TO ACHIEVE THAT AT THE BARGAINING TABLE OFFER ALL THE- BARGAINING UNITS- AND THAT'S- THE SECOND POINT I'LL MAKE IS WITH REGARD TO THE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT. WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING- THAT IS ONE OF THE TRIGGER POT SO IF WASHINGTON DC DOES COME. FORWARD WITH THE REQUISITE LEVEL OF STATE AND LOCAL ASSISTANCE DâN THAT THOSE CUTS- WOULD BE RESTORED. OKAY SO WHAT'S THE TIME LINE FOR ALL THAT HAPPENING I'LL GET ON THE MAY REVISE YOU YOU PUT AN AD NUMBER IN THERE AND AMOUNTS AND IT KIND OF SET DIFFERENT EXPECTATIONS SO HOW DOES THAT. HOW HOW'S THAT EVOLVED IN THE LAST. MONTH SO I CAN I. WOULD HAVE TO CHECK THAT WITH OURS FOLKS OR WORKING WITH PEOPLE THE BARGAINING SO LET ME BACK TO THAT OKAY I WANTED TO. NOW THE REVENUE ISSUES REVENUE IDEAS I KNOW THAT- YOU KNOW MY COLLEAGUE FROM ELK GROVE REYES SAID CONCERNS AS FAR AS THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN INDUSTRIES. I KNOW THERE ARE ARE ARE MANY PEOPLE LEGISLATURE THAT WANT TO PUT. EVEN MORE REVENUE IDEAS ON THE TABLE POTENTIALLY GO TO THE BALLOT TO REALLY LOOK AT. THE OVERALL- FUNDING FOR. KEY PROGRAMS LIKE EDUCATION OUR STATE AND I BY PERSONALLY SUPPORT THAT LOOKING AT AT REVENUE INCREASES BUT- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT- THIS IS AGAIN ABOUT CHOICES AND RISK REWARD DO WE WANT TO KEEP THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA FLOAT. WHICH IS THE MAJOR ARE INDEED DRIVER FOR OUR FOR OUR STATE. OUR C. S. YOUR COMMITTEE COLLEGES ARE CAR K. TWELVE SCHOOLS AND SO. HAVING THAT TIME OUT ON THESE FOR A NUMBER OF US SEVERAL YEARS AND NOT BE THE PERMANENT IN THE NATION. I THINK IS THE CHOICE THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE SO WE CANNOT DO THAT. AND WE CAN WE CAN SAY OKAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO THAT AND I WOULD JUST TELL PEOPLE WHO ARGUE THAT. OKAY GIVE US THE CUTS GIVE US TO GIVE US THE PLACES YOU WANT TO CUT. YOU WANT TO CUT WHEN WHAT'S THE AMOUNT AGAIN ON THE OTHER DAY FOR THE NEW REVENUES TOGETHER IT'S ABOUT A LITTLE OVER FOUR BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR. KERR US SO IT CHANGES YEAR TO YEAR BUT IN THE COMING YEAR IT'LL BE FOUR POINT FOUR BILL OKAY YEAH. SO I SENSUALLY AS THE STATE EQUIVALENT FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. SO IF THERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO GO ABOUT DOING THAT. I'M ALL YOURS BUT- I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A REALITY CHECK ON JUST THE SIMPLE MATHEMATICS SO THAT- I ALSO WANT TO JUST. A LIEU THAT I DO SUPPORT HOW WE'RE RE EVALUATING THAT THAT CAP AND TRADE- PLAN IN OUR PROPOSAL BUT I WILL NOTE THAT I AM. VERY VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE HIGH SPEED EL. AUTOMATIC I'M WAITING FOR THE MOMENT RIGHT CAN VOTE TO. RESEND THAT I THINK THAT WE ARE BETTER WAYS TO SPEND THAT MONEY THAT FOCUS ON OUR NEED. EVEN AND WELL AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND TRANSIT. AND COMMUTER RAIL FROM HERE TO THE BAY AREA FROM LA TO ORANGE. COUNTY UP AND DOWN THE ON. THIS THE CENTRAL VALLEY THE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE MY BETTER. TO ON THOSE DAHLE. ON COMMUTER RAIL THEY CAN ACTUALLY WORK. THAT WERE POPULAR BASES LIVE. AND WE HAVE A BIGGER IMPACT ON REDUCING. OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT IN CALIFORNIA SO I DO CONCUR ON THAT- I WANT TO NOW SHE HAVE TO THE AREA THAT I FOCUSED MONTHS. MOST ON THE BUDGET AND THAT'S- EDUCATION FROM EARLY EDUCATION THROUGH. THROUGH HIGHER IN K. TWELVE IN THE MIDDLE- YOU KNOW THE CUTS POTENTIAL CUTS IN THE TRIGGER FOR. THAT THEY MAY REVISE. I THINK. JUST A CUT IN AND OF ITSELF. THE PEOPLE ARE EVERYONE'S AGAINST THE CUT AND I GUESS PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TWO REASONS I DON'T LIKE THE CATS ONE. THEY KNOW IT'S CAN IMPACT A PERSON. AT YOU KNOW FIFTIES. THOUSAND TEACHERS LOSE THEIR JOBSAND THE KERR MAY REVISE A PUZZLE. HUNDRED THOUSAND CLASSIFIED WORKERS FROM. CLASSMATES BUS DRIVERS CAFETERIA WORKERS THAT'S A PERSON THAT WOULD THAT WOULD PHYSICALLY LOSE THEIR JOB AND SO THAT YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WARES ON PEOPLE MAKING DECISIONS- AND THEN WE ALL BELIEVE IN THE PROGRAMS THAT THEY PROVIDE. SO WE GET THAT BUT I THINK THE BIGGER ICTURE WHAT I MENTIONED EARLIER. IS THAT. THESE CUTS DON'T JUST HAVE THOSE TWO IMPACTS THEY HAVE THE IMPACT THAT THEY WOULD. SLOW DOWN OUR ABILITY TO TURN THE ECONOMY BACK ON BECAUSE- YOU KNOW MY FAMILY. FAMILIES ALL ACROSS ACKERMAN AND CALIFORNIA.SCHOOL AND CHILD CARE DEPEND ON PEOPLE GOING BACK TO WORK PEOPLE PARENTS ARE LITTLE A STRADDLED. IN THEIR HOMES BECAUSE THEY NEED TO BE. CHILD CARE PROVIDERS NEED TO BE THE HOME SCHOOL TEACHER. AND HOW DO PEOPLE GET BACK AT IT HOW DO WE TURN OUR ECONOMY BACK ON WITH SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE WORKING COHORT. AGE YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THEIR PRIME WORKING YEARS. A LOT OF THEM WE NOW HAVE CHILDREN SIX MILLION CALIFORNIA KIDS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS IN OUR CHILD CARE PROGRAMS AND SO. IF WE DON'T ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE CAN'T TURN THAT LIGHT SWITCH BACK ON- TO THE ECONOMY SO. THAT'S WHY IT'S NOT EASY TO DO THE DEFERRALS. BUT WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE GET GET AN AWARD PAT ON THE BACK FOR THE AUSTERITY BUDGET. AND SHUT DOWN SCHOOLS IN CHILD CARE CENTERS. THAT'S NOT GONNA HELP. TURN THE ECONOMY BACK ON SO I THINK YOU NEED A REALITY CHECK THEIR- AS WELL. AND THEN I WILL NOTE THAT- WITH OUR SCHOOLS I'VE BEEN TALKING TO OUR DISTRICTS AND TO PROTECT ALL ACROSS THE STATE FROM MANY OF. OUR DISTRICTS HERE MY COLLEAGUES HERE AND THERE'S- A LOT UNANSWERED QUESTION AS FAR AS NOT JUST MONEY. AND HOW THAT WOULD WORK THEY DO PREFER OUR PLAN MORE THE- LAST CUTS BUT- THAT THE CONCLUSION IS. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO MORE. WITH LESS- HERE IN SACRAMENTO THEY JUST UNVEILED WHAT HOW THEY WOULD DO ARE. STAGGERED SCHOOL SCHEDULE AND- MORE RESOURCES NEEDED AND SO THAT THIS THE RE OPENING OF THE SCHOOLS AND SOME IN THE GOVERNOR. IS WORKING ON WITH OUR SUPERINTENDENT AND- WE'RE TRYING TO TIME IT BECAUSE THE SCHOOL YEARS COMING UP AND WE'RE DOING THE BUDGET SAME TIME BUT THERE ARE SO MANY. UNANSWERED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RE OPENING OF THE SCHOOLS I JUST WANTED TO ASK YOU IF YOU COULD. HELP AND LIGHTNESS AND THAT'S ON THIS FRONT. YEAH SO I KNOW THAT WILL BE HAVE JESSICA HOMES ON THE LINE I KNOW THAT GUIDANCE IS FORTHCOMING BUT LET ME TURN IT OVER TED JESSICA HOMES TO SPEAK ABOUT THAT THE RE OPENING CONSIDERATION SPECIFICALLY. AT HOME DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER MCCARTY FOR YOUR QUESTION SO AS YOU MENTIONED YES WE ARE WORKING. ON VERY. DILIGENTLY AWAY AT THE SUPERINTENDENT AS WELL AS A VARIETY OF STAKEHOLDERS THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND DEVELOP SOME GUIDELINES FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR. WE OPENING TO ENSURE HEALTH AND SAFETY THAT FAMILIES FEEL COMFORTABLE PAYING THEIR- STUDENT BACK TO SCHOOL- WE ARE PLANNING TO RELEASE THOSE. THAT VERY SHORTLY- AND ALSO LOOKING AT THE ISSUE OF- APPLYING AT- PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT FOR- SCHOOL DOES NOT BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT THAT THE CONCERN- AMONG OUR SCHOOLS. AND CHILD CARE CENTERS BUT THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW AND WE HOPE TO- PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION- ON VERY SHORTLY. OKAY THE NEXT QUESTION AS FAR AS THE EDUCATION I WANTED TO LIEU TO IS- RELATED FLEXIBILITY FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS SORT OUR LAST RECESSION BEFORE YOU AND I WERE HERE. THE WE- OF COURSE WE HAD REDUCTIONS BUT WE ALSO YOU KNOW. LACKS THE MONEY GIVE THEM WITH ALL THOSE CATEGORICAL IS GIVE THEM MORE AUTHORITY TO MOVE MONEY AROUND. TO ESSENTIALLY YOU KNOW STAY ALIVE DURING THOSE TOUGH TIMES AND SO I'VE HEARD THAT REQUEST IN THE NUMBER THE LAST FEW DAYS OF NOT JUST THE MONEY PEACE BUT WHAT CAN THE STATE DO AS FAR AS- FLEXIBILITY FROM OTHER. EDUCATION POTS AND ONE TIME AND CARRY OVER MONEY AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP SCHOOL DISTRICTS SO THAT SOMETHING THAT WE THINK WE BE WILLING TO ENTERTAIN AS WE FINALIZE. EITHER THIS BUDGET HERE OR EVEN AFTER AT THE NEXT WHO DO I TRAILER BILLS AND CLEAN UP IN THE WEEKS AFTER. YEAH SO WHAT JESSICA SPEAKER THAT IN THE ONE- POINT ALTHOUGH THE WAY MAJOR DIFFERENCE HERE COMPARED TO THE LAST RECESSION IS THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA WHICH ON THE NATURAL WILL PROVIDE DISTRICTS MORE FLEXIBILITY AND THEY HAD. A DECADE AGO BUTLET ME TURN IT OVER TO JUST GO TO SPEAK ABOUT THE SPECIFICS. THANK YOU YES AND SO I WOULD MENTION THAT WE DO HAVE WE HAVE BUILT THEM FLEXIBILITY IS AND THEN THE REVISION- YOU KNOW ONE EXAMPLE OF THE FLEXIBILITY TO BE INCLUDED. RELATE TO ENTER FUND BORROWING AND PROVIDING MORE- OPPORTUNITIES FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO DO YOU ENTER FUND BY ROWING TO HELP TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT WITH. POTENTIAL REDUCTION BUT WE ARE WE HAVE RECEIVED CONTINUOUS AD RESPONSE FROM STAKEHOLDERS AND WE HAVE BEEN TALKING WITH LEGISLATIVE STAFF ABOUT- OTHER POTENTIAL POSSIBILITIES THAT I KNOW THE LEGISLATURE'S INTERESTED IN. ADOPTING AND WE CAN KEY THE CONVERSATION. INTERESTED IN ENSURING THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT HAVE AS MUCH FLEXIBILITY AS POSSIBLE- I WOULD ALSO ADD TO MISTER GIBSON OFTEN AND COMMENT ABOUT IN THE DIFFERENCE BEING LPS PATH I WOULD TO THE OTHER DIFFERENT. I'M IN THE COPA NINETEEN- PANDEMIC AND HOW THAT HAS. MAYBE CHANGE SOME OF THE NEEDS OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS- IN TERMS OF FLEXIBILITY SO WE'RE WE'RE CONSIDERING ALL THAT AND- WORKING HARD WITH BUT YOUR STAFF. OKAY I JUST ON THAT NO WE DO KNOW THAT THEY'LL SEE A FAT. CERTAINLY HAS MORE FLEXIBILITY BUT I THINK THERE ARE SOME. PROPOSALS AND- TWEAKING THAT WORK THAT TO. WHETHER IT'S- SCHOOL ACTS- THAT YOU KNOW SCHOOL BOARD ASSOCIATION AND- THE YOU KNOW THE RECORD FILE TEACHERS A CLASSIFIED. EMPLOYEES ARE KIND OF COALESCING AROUND SOME IDEAS HOW WE CAN FURTHER THAT FLEXIBILITY. I WANT TO- PAY A LITTLE BIT TO HIGHER EDUCATION AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. IT WILL BE PUT TO. THE WILL THE THEY MAY REVISE I THINK HAD REALLY TOUGH CHOICES FOR AT ALL EVERYBODY AND THOSE TRIGGERS WOULD HAVE BEEN. DISASTROUS FOR SCHOOLS EARLY AT HIGHER AND COMMITTEE CALL JUST. I THINK THAT WE'RE VERY PLEASED ABOUT THE OBVIOUSLY WE EMBRACE IT TODAY THE ASSEMBLY SENATE PACKAGE- THE ONE THAT WE WEREN'T ABLE TO FIND- ENOUGH RESOURCES TO. IT IN MY IN MY OPINION IS OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES ASSUMING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACKNOWLEDGE. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE MADE THAT THE CHOICE AND IT'S YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE- MAY NOT LIKE IT BUT I THINK THE MAJORITY LEGISLATURE BIPARTISAN THOUGHT IT WAS THE RIGHT CALL. TO ELIMINATE THE EXPERIMENT OF CALIBRATE- WE'VE ALLOCATE LAST TWO BUDGETS OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING AND ONE TIME. TO SERVE. UP SEVENTY FIVE STUDENTS TO HAVE YOU KNOW. EXECUTIVES WITH ALMOST THAT WAY MORE SALARY IN THE GOVERNOR I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH IT IS MAYBE ALMOST ON- POTENTIALLY DOUBLE WHAT ARE GOVERNOR MAKES. TO SERVE SEVENTY FIVE STUDENTS AND SO SERVING SEVENTY FIVE STUDENTS OR SERVING TWO POINT ONE MILLION WE THINK OUR PRIORITIES WE SHOULD PROP UP. HELPING THE TWO POINT ONE. MILLION STUDENTS WHO ARE ALL DOING ONLINE RIGHT NOW SO WE THOUGHT THT WAS THE RIGHT CALL. TO HELP THAT WITH THOSE EXISTING STUDENTS AND PROP UP THE ONLINE- PROGRAM WE HAVE FOR EXISTING COMMUNITY COLLEGE. SYSTEM AND SO- WHEN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE BE- CAN PUT THAT ON THE RECORD TODAY. LASTLY I JUST WANTED TO LAY OUT. AND THEN ASK YOU- YOUR YOUR YOUR THOUGHTS I KNOWING YOU'RE NEGOTIATING RIGHT NOW WITH OUR WITH OUR LEADERSHIP FROM THE SPEAKER IN THE PRO TEM ON THE CELL- I WANT TO RESPECT THAT PROCESS. BUT WE IN THE LEGISLATURE- RELATE TO EARLY EDUCATION LIKE I SAID EARLIER WE REALIZE IT'S NOT JUST IMPORTANT NOT JUST IMPORTANT THAT THE FIRST FEW YEARS OF A CHILD'S BRAIN AND HELPING PARENTS GO TO WORK AND BEING AN ANTI POVERTY PROGRAM AND ALL THE REASONS WE SUPPORT EARLY AND WHAT REALLY MATTERS BUT WE THINK. IT'S SO KEY FOR PEOPLE TO GET BACK TO WORK AND SO WE COULDN'T STOP- A PICKUP APPROVED REGARDLESS OF TRIGGER Nó TRIGGER THOSE CUTS TO CHILD CARE IN FULL DAY PRE SCHOOL PROGRAMS THAT THEY'RE BARELY AFLOAT NOW BEFORE THAT PANDEMIC AND- THE FINANCIALLY DON'T CANCEL OUT AND SELL THAT WOULD JUST BE- YOU KNOW THE DEATH SENTENCE TO SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS AND JUST FURTHER HAMPER OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY- WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE IN NEXT- HEROES BACK AT THE CONGRESSIONAL LEVEL. AND ONE THING THAT AS BEEN BIPARTISAN SO FAR IS EARLY EDUCATION FROM THE CONGRESSIONAL LEVEL FROM REPUBLICANS FROM THE WHITE HOUSE IN DID DEMOCRATS AS WELL AND SO ONE THING THAT WE WANT TO DO IS TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN PRE PROGRAM NOT IN FOCUS ON ACCESS NOT JUST KEEPING A FLOW BUT HOW DO WE SERVE. MORE PEOPLE WHO ARE IS TO WORKERS AND YOU KNOW PRETTY MUCH THE PEOPLE WHO GO TO THE STATE FUNDED CHILDCARE PROGRAMS. OVER I THINK TO ARE BY DEAF THE SENSE OF WORKERS EITHER IN HEALTH CARE OR THAT SERVICE FIELD AND YOU KNOW THERE'S A HUGE NEED. AND SO AS FAR AS- ACCESS AND SLOTS AND- STABILIZING THE RATES TO MAKE SURE THEY ACTUALLY- CANCEL OUT AND CAN STAY AFLOAT FINANCIALLY AND JUST OVERALL INFRASTRUCTURE SO- WE PUT FOR THAT A PROPOSAL IN OUR PLAN AND YOU KNOW WE THINK THAT IT IS NOT JUST RIGHT FOR THE MORAL REASONS BUT RIGHT FOR OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY. AND WANTED TO ASK YOU IF YOU HAD INITIAL THOUGHTS ON THAT. YEAH I'LL SAY VERY BRIEFLY- AND I KNOW JUST ON THE LINE AS WELL THAT THAT GOVERNOR SHARES OF COURSE SO MANY OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT YOU JUST MADE AND ONE THING YOU MADE IN PARTICULAR ABOUT FEDERAL FUNDING IS IN ADDITION. TO THE FLEXIBLE RELIEF THAT WE ARE ALL HOPING FOR AT THE GOVERNOR IS ALSO APPRECIATED THE EXTRA FUNDING FOR THE CHILD CARE DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT THAT CONGRESS PROVIDED AND WE'RE HOPING FOR MORE SPECIFICALLY IN THAT AREA AS WELL- WHEN IT COMES ARE SPECIFICALLY TO THE CUTS ARE IN THE NAY REVISION COMPARED TO THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE. I KNOW THERE WILL BE MORE TO SAY ABOUT HOW TO RESOLVE THOSE IN THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS. OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR RENTAL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND AS I BEGAN I WANT TO START WHERE- OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO- WAS WHICH WAS THAT WE WERE NOT PRESENT DURING THE LAST% RECESSION. AND I THINK MANY OF US HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND LOOK TO OUR PREDECESSORS TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE ARE SOME LESSONS TO BE LEARNED. AND IF WE DON'T STAND. AS WE'VE LEARNED FROM HISTORY THOSE WHO DO NOT ARE DOOMED TO REPEAT IT. AND I WANT TO ASK YOU TWO QUESTIONS MR THIS ONE EVEN IF I CAN'T. FIRST CAN YOU HELP ME TO DEFINE WHAT SUBSIDIARITY MEETINGS WHAT DOES THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CATEGORIZE IT AS- SO THAT WAS THE TERM- THAT WAS USED OFTEN BY GOVERNOR BROWN- SO I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR A GOVERNOR BROWN- BUT MY RECOLLECTION IS THAT. IT REFERS TO- GIVING GREATER RESPONSIBILITY TO JURISDICTIONS LOCALLY ON THE GROUND. SO IF I CAN I. THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT SUBSIDIARITY HAS NOT BEEN PERFECT. AND I WOULD USE AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE FACT THAT IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE AND IN TWENTY ELEVEN WE'VE HAD TO DO REALIGNMENT. AND SO I THANK MY QUESTION FOR YOU MY FINAL QUESTION AND I'M SORRY FOR BEING SO POINTED. IS THAT GIVEN THE FISCAL CONSTRAINTS THAT ARE COUNTIES NOW FACE. IS THE ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERING DISCUSSIONS WITH COUNTIES ON HOW BEST TO REALIGN PROGRAMS AND FUNDING TO BETTER PROTECT OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND TO BETTER REFLECT OUR CALIFORNIA VALLEY'S. ON THE QUESTION I WILL SAY NUMBER ONE IT JUST AS WITH THE LEGISLATURE WERE IN TOUCH WITH COUNTIES AND CITIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND ALL THESE ISSUES ESPECIALLY NOW GIVEN THE STRESS THAT THEY'RE UNDER AND WE APPRECIATE THAT STRESS AND- WE KNOW IT'S EASY TO LOOK AT OUR OWN YOU KNOW FIFTY FOUR POINT THREE BILLION DOLLAR BUDGETGAP BUT WE UNDERSTAND THOSE. STRESSES THAT THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE FACING SECOND- SPECIFICALLY WHEN IT COMES TO COUNTIES THE NAY REVISION INCLUDED ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS OF THE FEDERAL ALLOCATION TO HELP- COUNTY- HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES AND SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT ALLOCATION IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO ALLEVIATE. ALL THE STRESSES- THAT- THOSE JURISDICTIONS ARE FACING- WE ALSO KNOW FROM THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS PROVIDING ADDITIONAL SUPPORT SO THIS ISSUE IS TOP OF MIND FOR US JUST AS IT IS FOR THE LEGISLATURE SO IT'S JUST A MATTER OF WHERE THOSE RESOURCES WILL COME FROM TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER THE SUPPORT THAT'S NEEDED. Q. AND- WITH THAT I THINK THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE TRANSITION IF I CAN TO THE LA HOW AND SO. THE NEXT THREE QUESTIONS I HAVE- WILL BE FOR YOU MISTER PADDOCK. AND I THINK WHERE- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST. STATED THAT THERE WILL BE A SHORTFALL CURRENTLY EVEN WITH THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL THERE'S A BILLION DOLLAR SHORTFALL WITHIN THE COUNTIES. AND MY HOPE- WITH THE LA- IS IF. YOU CAN HELP MY OFFICE TO IDENTIFY WHICH PROGRAMS ARE CURRENTLY MOST AT RISK. DUE TO THE NINETEEN NINETY ONE IN TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT. AND OUR CURRENT FUNDING SHORTFALLS. YES DOCTOR RAM YOU I THINK THAT- THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION WE HAVE- YEAH WE DID NOTE THE CITY SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE THAT COUNTIES WILL BE UNDER FOR THE REALIGNMENT PROGRAMS BUT- I'M GONNA IT- IT PASS IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE CAROLINE CHU WHO HEIS. A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE DETAILS ON ON THOSE THAT PROGRAMS. GOOD MORNING CHAIR NUMBERS CAROLINE SURE OF LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WITH REGARD TO HELP COUNTIES WILL RESPOND TO THE DECLINE IN REVENUES IN REALIGNMENT- WE'RE LIKELY TO SEE A FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT RESPONSES- IN TERMS OF EXACTLY HOW THEY PRIORITIZE WHERE TO MAKE- REDUCTIONS AND HOW TO EXECUTE THOSE. SOMETHING I WOULD NOTE THOUGH THAT WE MIGHT ANTICIPATE IN TERMS OF WHAT WE WOULD SEE IF THAT REALIGNMENT HAS A MIXTURE OF ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS AND NON ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS. AND SO COUNTY IS LIKELY WILL HAVE TO PRIORITIZE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE- STRICT ENTITLEMENT REQUIREMENTS AND STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS OTHER ONE ALL OVER THOSE THAT MIGHT HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY IN THEM. BUT NOW THAT SAID SOME OF THE PROGRAMS OVER WHICH COUNTIES HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY LIKE PUBLIC HEALTH- THE COUNTIES HAVE RECEIVED AND WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS BUT THAT COULD BE AN AREA OF CONCERN FOR THE LEGISLATURE WHERE ARE THE LEGISLATURE WOULDN'T OTHERWISE ONE COUNTIES TO REDUCE FUNDING. WE CERTAINLY COULD HELP YOU ARE DOCTOR ARAMBULA I'VE TRIED TO SURVEY COUNTIES IN TERMS OF HOW THEY MIGHT PLAN TO GO ABOUT DEALING WITH THE REDUCTIONS IN REVENUE. ABOUT LIKELY AS I MENTIONED WE'LL SEE A REALLY A MIXTURE OF RESPONSES- OVER THE NEXT YEAR OR SO. AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK YOU'VE HIT- RIGHT ON THE NAIL IF I CAN- THE NON ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS THAT TO REALLY WOULD BE MOST AT RISK WHETHER OR NOT THAT POTENTIALLY CHILD WELFARE SERVICES OR- ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES I THINK WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND TO KNOW AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY- WHO WHAT. THOSE POTENTIAL CUTS ARE ON THE TABLE BY THE FIFTY DIFFERENT COUNTIES. NOW IF I CAN SAY DURING THE LAST RECESSION I THOUGHT THERE REALLY WAS A TRAGIC CHANGE. THAT WE MADE ONE THAT I HOPE WE CAN IMPROVE UPON NOW TO OUR CAL WORKS TIME CLOCKS. AND IN MANY COUNTIES INCLUDING- THE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT. WHICH WERE SOME OF THOSE WHICH WERE HARDEST HIT AND STILL HAVE YET TO QUITE RECOVER. MY FEAR IS THAT MANY OF THE POLICIES THAT WE STILL APPLY TODAY. ONLY WHITE AND THE DISPARITIES THAT WE SEE WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND SO MY NEXT QUESTION FOR THE LA- IF I CAN IS. CAN YOU HELP TO IDENTIFY WHICH POLICIES ENACTED DURING THIS LAST RECESSION SUCH AS THE TIME CLOCKS AND WITHIN REALIGNMENT. THAT COULD HELP US TO CLOSE THOSE INEQUITIES WITHIN CALIFORNIA. WE CERTAINLY CAN WORK WITH YOUR STAFF TO LOOK AT THE POLICY CHANGES AND THERE'VE BEEN A NUMBER OF STUDIES THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S COMMISSION OVER TIME TO LOOK AT THAT AS WELL THAT WE COULD- MAKE SURE THAT YOU ALL HAVE ACCESS TO. AND JUST TO PIGGY BACK ON TO THIS TIME CLOCK ISSUE IT'S PARTICULARLY. TIMELY NOW ONE SORRY FOR THAT POND BUT I COULDN'T HELP MYSELF. BUT AS WE GO THROUGH THIS RECESSION THOSE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE NEED THAT TIME NOW TO ACTUALLY BE UTILIZING THOSE PROGRAMS AND- HAVE A CONCERN THAT WE CAN HELP TO RECTIFY THAT AND FIX THAT FROM THE LAST RECESSION AND IMPROVE UPON IT. MY FINAL QUESTION IF I CAN IS. FIRST WANTING TO ACTUALLY START BY THANKING BOTH LEADERSHIP STAFF AND ADVOCATES. FOR ALL THE HARD WORK AND EFFORT THAT WE HAVE DONE TO GET TO TODAY'S PROPOSALS. AS MANY OF THE PROGRAMS WE HAVE PROVIDED WILL HELP US TO DIRECTLY ADDRESS DISPARITIES. BUT MY FINAL QUESTION FOR YOU LA- IS WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN HELP US TO IDENTIFY. WHERE IF ANY. AS AN EXAMPLE ALL PROVIDE THE- GOVERNOR'S ANNOUNCED MEALS FOR SENIORS PROGRAMS. THAT COUNTY MATCHES ARE IN THIS BUDGET. AND WHY I'M INTERESTED IS THAT IT'S MY BELIEF THAT RICH COUNTIES GET RICHER. AND THAT POOR COUNTIES LIKE MINE ARE NOT ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS NOT A SINGLE COUNTY IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY PARTICIPATED IN THAT SENIOR MEALS PROGRAMS AND WANTS US TO BE AWARE OF WHICH PROGRAMS HAVE COUNTY MATCHES SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE ARE RECEIVING SERVICES. SO THAT WE DO NOT. EXACERBATE DISPARITIES. CAN YOU HELP US TO IDENTIFY WHAT THOSE COUNTY MATCHES ARE IN THIS CURRENT BUDGET. WE CERTAINLY CAN'T AND TO CLARIFY DOCTOR IN BILL YOU WANT TO LOOK AT NEW PROGRAMS NOT EXISTING PROGRAMS LIKE THOSE WITH AND REALIGNMENT NOW I'M TALKING SPECIFICALLY WITHIN THIS BUDGET HERE TODAY AS I RECEIVED A PRINT OF IT A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THE HEARING IT'S- HARD FOR ME TO. PROCESS FULLY EVERYTHING AND YET I'M WANTING TO WORK WITH YOU AS THE NONPARTISAN ARM OF OUR LEGISLATIVE BRANCH TO HELP US TO FIGURE THAT OUT. BUT SURELY I'M I WILL END WITH JUST SAYING A SIMPLE REQUEST AND WE CAN FOLLOW UP OFF LINE WITH THE LA OUT- BUT THERE'S AN INTEREST FROM BOTH MY OFFICE AND I HOPE TO BRING IN- THE CHAIR OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE- SUBCOMMITTEE AS WELL INTO A CONVERSATION ABOUT FUNDING FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOUR OFFICE AT LEAST WHILE I HAVE pYOU ON THE LINE HERE TODAY TO FOLLOW UP EITHER LATER TDAY OR TOMORROW ON SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS QUITE TIMELY AND APPROPRIATE RIGHT NOW. SURELY BEFORE I PASS IT BACK TO YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANT TO SAY A BIG THANK YOU. TO EVERYONE WHO IS HELPING US TO PROTECT OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES WITH THIS BUDGET. THE HELP WITHIN HEALTH FOR ALL ELDERS AS WELL AS THE CHILD TAX CREDIT WITH AND CAL EITC WILL. GREATLY HELP OR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AND I JUST WANTED TO STAND UP THE RESPECT THAT THàNH RIGHT THANK EVERYONE WHO'S WORKING ON THIS BUDGET. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU DON'T WORK. YES I WANT TO THANK THOSE WHO WORKED VERY HARD ON THIS BUDGET YOU KNOW THAT WE FINALLY ARRIVED AT. ROUGHLY A BETTER CONCLUSION THAT WOULD START WITH THE FORD SO IT MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT BETTER A LITTLE BIT MORE PALATABLE ARE STILL ASKING A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT WE NEED TO ASK- JUST WANTED TO- IN DELVING A LITTLE BIT INTO THE- UNIVERSITY FUNDING AND- LOOKING AT IT I'VE HAD PEOPLE CONCERNED. THAT THE LAST TIME AND I KIND OF LIVED THROUGH THE LAST RECESSION AS A UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR. WELL THE LAST TIME% WHEN WE WERE ENGAGED IN SOMETHING LIKE THIS- AS WE WERE CUTTING- POSITIONS DOING FOR LITTLE SWITCHING ARRANGEMENTS. ARE INSTITUTIONS WERE SCHOOLING WAY MONEY FOR OTHER THINGS AND THEN WE FOUND OUT RECENTLY OF COURSE THAT THEY HAD OVER BILLION DOLLARS THAT THEY HAD TO I HAD A TO STOCKPILE WATER MEANT WHAT ARE OUR EMPLOYEES WERE. BEING DENIED TO PAY INCREASES EXPERIENCING FURLOUGHS 10% CUTS IN THEIR SALARIES SO FORTH AND SO ON. ARE WE REQUIRING THAT FEES. THESE FUNDS THAT HAD BEEN REYES NOT NECESSARILY- IN THE BEST WAY ARE WE REQUIRE THAT THEY UTILIZE THOSE FUNDS AT THIS TIME THE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T PUT ANY MORE DAMAGE. AND HURT ON TO OUR EMPLOYEES AT THE UNIVERSITY. WHAT ME TURN IT OVER TO CHRIS FERGUSON HE'S ON THE PHONE AND HE'LL BE ABLE TO SPEAK IN DETAIL TO THE NATION. YEAH CHRIS SERVICE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SO OUR PROPOSAL TO GO LOCAL FIRE THEM TO A REQUIRED TO SEGMENT THAT IT'S TO UTILIZE THEIR- RESEARCH- FOR THE PURPOSES YOU NOTED. HOWEVER UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. IT IS ASSUMED THAT BOWL THE UC AND SEE IF SHE WOULD NEED TO- USED AS WELL OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WOULD NEED TO. TAP INTO THEIR RESERVES TO. SUSTAIN THEIR CORE OPERATIONS. BUT WHEN REQUIRING WHICH MEANS THEY COULD DO IT SOME OF THEM DID AND THAT WAS TO INCREASE STUDENT FEES- NOT ONLY WITH A PARKING FEES BUT OTHER STUDENTS SUPPOSEDLY ACADEMIC FEES. AROUND THE SYSTEM AS A RESULT WERE ABLE TO STOCKPILE THESE RESOURCES- WHILE THEY WERE OF SUPPOSEDLY CUTTING PROGRAMS AND CUTTING SALARIES- I JUST THINK THAT- IF WE IF WE'RE HONEST ABOUT IT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAREFULLY WATCH THAT THAT'S AN ONGOING CONCERN. WE PASS LEGISLATION THAT THOUGH SUPPOSEDLY DOES NOT ALLOW THEM TO RAISE FEES WITHOUT STUDENT INPUT AND MY UNDERSTANDING THAT I GOT FROM SOMEONE THE OTHER DAY IS OUR CAMPUSES ARE STILL DOING IT DESPITE THE LEGISLATION. AND SO WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE OVERSIGHT ON THAT WE KNOW THAT TIMES ARE HARD BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT'S ALSO HARD ON OUR EMPLOYEES AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN THAT THAT HAPPENS IN A DIFFERENT WAY. SO THAT THEY DO DO THAT- I HOPE IT AS WE TALK WHAT EDUCATIONAL FLEXIBILITY AND THAT'S IMPORTANT- WE ARE IN A DIFFERENT PLACE THE LAST TIME WE DID- WHEN YOU HAD TO DO CUTS OF WE HAD A LOT OF CHEMICAL OR BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE CATEGORY BECAUSE NOT THAT MUCH NOW. BUT I KNOW THERE'S A DESIRE FOR FLEXIBILITY- AND WHILE I GENERALLY SUPPORT FLEXIBILITY I TRY NOT TO SUPPORT IT AT THE EXPENSE OF THE POOREST KIDS IN OUR DISTRICT. AND SO I THINK WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE'VE SEEN THAT IN OUR- AUDIT REPORT THE USE THE MISUSE OF DOLLARS THAT SHOULD HAVE GONE TO POOR KIDS WERE ROLLED OVER TO THE NEXT YEAR WE HAVE LEGISLATION NOW. TO PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING BUT AS PEOPLE CLAMOR FOR FLEXIBILITY WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE KNOW WHAT THEY WANT TO BE FLEXIBLE ABOUT AN OFTENTIMES AT LEAST IN OUR DISTRICTS OF. THE POOREST FAMILIES THOUGH OF COURSE CHILDREN OF THE LEAST PERFORMING ONES BECAUSE IT CLAMOR SOUL IS SO GREAT FROM OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MORE AFFLUENT THEY END UP ALL- NOT HEARING THE VOICES OF THOSE WHO ARE BEHIND. AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KNOW THAT FLEXIBILITY IS NOT INCLUDE USE OF THE- SUPPLEMENTAL GRANTS AND WE'RE SATISFIED TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP THAT IS A NON. NEGOTIABLE IN SHOULD BE IN THE LINE TO GIVE THEM. A NEGOTIABLE. US BECAUSE THAT JUST DAY TO DAY HOLE. AND MAKES IT HARDER FOR OUR KIDS AND OUR AND OUR- AND OUR TO ECONOMY TO REBOUND. SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IS CLEAR BECAUSE IT SOUNDS GOOD ON THE SURFACE THAT THE ONE FLEXIBILITY- BUT WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. WHEN THEY HAD ALL THE FLEXIBILITY AND IN GOOD TIMES. THEY DID NOT DID THEY USED WELL. I KNOW IN MY COUNTY AND IN ANOTHER. TWO DISTRICTS- OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WERE.WERE ROLLED OVER TO BE USED TO OF THE FOR PENSIONS AND A HOST OF OTHER THINGS. SO WE CAN'T AFFORD TO ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN FOR KIDS TO. UNDERSTAND IS ABOUT SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT DID NOT GET TO OUR CHILDREN THAT SHOULD HAVE GOT TO OUR KIDS AND IT FIVE YEAR PERIOD. SO WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT UP WHEN WE TALK FLEXIBILITY IT'S NOT ABOUT FLEXIBILITY ON THE BACK OF THE POOR. AND THOSE WHO BEHIND SO ON MAKE SURE OF THAT BECAUSE I THINK WE CAN. IT SOUNDS GOOD ON THE SURFACE BUT WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOES NOT- YOU KNOWS US CDC ARE HIS IT HASN'T SUFFERED AS MANY CUTS AS EVERYBODY ELSE IN AND UNDERSTAND WHY THAT LITTLE. GENERAL PUBLIC'S FEAR OF OPENING THE GATES OF THE PRISONS. IS PRETTY. SIGNIFICANT AND AS A RESULT FOLKS ON TO MAKE SURE. THE PRISON DOORS AT THEIR- MY- MY CONCERN CONTINUES TO REMAIN THAT THINGS ARE HAPPENING DESPITE WHAT WE HAVE SAID IN. COMMITTEE THAT WE WANT TO SEE FIRST. YOU KNOW. THE YEAH I STILL PLAN TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF. OF THE VALUE WAITING AND ALL AND SHUTTING DOWN PRISONS- AND MAYBE EVEN. ONE IN THE COMING YEAR THAT PEOPLE DON'T THE CALIFORNIA SOMETHING PRISON I FORGET WHAT IT IS IT'S A- PRIVATE PRISON. BUT I'M LOOKING AT THAT AND WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY SAID- TWO. OF YOUR OPERATION AND OTHERS. WHERE ARE THE STANDARDS BY WHICH WE CLOSE PRISONS. AND MEMBERS ARE CONCERNED BECAUSE IT CAN BECOME VERY ARBITRARY. AND WE SHOULD BE IN A POSITION WHERE WE CAN SAY. OF THESE ARE THE STANDARDS THESE ARE THE EXPECTATIONS AND THIS IS WHAT WE FOUND AND WHY WE CLOSE X. PRISON VERSES Y. PRISON. THAT IF WE CAN ARTICULATE THAT TO THE PUBLIC THEY WILL BE MORE THAN LIKELY WILLING TO ACCEPT IT RATHER THAN THING IS SOME KIND OF POLITICAL DECISION. THAT WE MADE BASED ON WHO THE MOST INFLUENTIAL MEMBER WAS IN THE ROOM WITH THE TIME. AND SO WE REALLY HAVE TO HAVE THAT FIRST AND I GET FRUSTRATED WHEN I SEE THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY WHAT WE'VE DONE FIRST- WE'RE WORKING ON IT I KEEP BEING TOLD AND THERE'S SOME THINGS FLOATING AROUND. BUT THEN I HEAR ABOUT PEOPLE MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CLOSE CERTAIN PLACES AND I'M SAYING BUT DID THEY MEET THE STANDARDS THAT I HAVE THAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN. AND WEARABLE STANDARDS AND THAT AND THAT IS CRITICAL- I'M NOT SURE WHERE WE PLAN TO MAKE THOSE SAVINGS WITH S GOING TO BE IN THIS BUDGET OR THE NEXT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THIS. PROCESS FOR DOING AND THAT'S A CONCERN. WANT TO MAKE SURE SOMEONE MENTIONED THAT THE MOVEMENT OF DJJ ONCE AGAIN ANOTHER ISSUE THAT IS SO OVER YEAR OLD- AND WHAT MOST OF US WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE IDENTIFY THE PROGRAMS IN ADVANCE THAT WILL BE IN DJJ. SO WE MAKE SURE THAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE GETTING WHAT THEY DESERVE. AS WELL AS- OUR ROLE IN OVERSIGHT THAT WAS RAISED BEFORE THAT WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT AS WE MOVE THESE YOUNG PEOPLE TO THE VARIOUS COUNTIES IN PROGRAMS. THAT THEY'RE NOT WINNERS AND LOSERS YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT COUNTIES WHERE THEY HAVE LOTS OF MONEY IN THE KIDS ARE GETTING OUT. OF A CADILLAC EDUCATION AND THEN WE'LL GO TO OTHERS AND THEY'RE DRIVING TO A BURNOUT PANTO SO WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE. THAT THERE IS OVERSIGHT ON OUR PART AND I HAVEN'T YET TO SEE WHAT WE'RE SAYING THAT EVERY EVERY KID HAS TO GET. OUR WHAT OUR OUTCOME SHOULD BE AND IF WE MOVE IT TO THE COUNTIES WHERE THE NOT THE COUNTY SO PREPARE TO RECEIVE THEM- SO- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DOING A LOT OF THINGS AND I AND I'M CONCERNED THAT WE HAVEN'T DONE THE PRELIMINARY WORK TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. THAT THAT COULD BE DONE SO. WHAT THANK YOU GUYS FOR THE WORK YOU'VE DONE I'M I'M GLAD THAT I JUSTICE FOLKS TONIGHT IS GOING TO BE AS HURT AS AS WE THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE. IN A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT APPEAR BUT- OF MY PERSPECTIVE FROM A CDC ARE. THE BUT THE PUBLIC SAFETY THAT WE MAKE A LOT OF RECOMMENDATIONS. AND WE DON'T DO A WHOLE LOT OF PLAN. I THE REASON. IT WAS LIKE THEY'RE EXPENDABLE PEOPLE BE. IF WE FAIL THE PROCESS. OR WILL THEY JUST WAS A BUNCH OF PRISONERS ANYWAY- RATHER THAN THINKING THAT THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE EVEN A GREATER RESPONSIBILITY. FOR BECAUSE THEY'RE IN THE CARE OF THE STATE WITH THE REST OF THE FOLKS AND NOT. AND WE OUGHT TO BE MUCH MORE CONSCIOUS OF THE HEALTH CARE- I'VE YET TO SEE A REALLY GOOD PLAN. THE DEALS WITH COVERT IN THE PRISONS- THAT TELLS ME THAT- THAT. THAT THEY'RE HANDLING IT EFFECTIVELY. AND THAT WOULD FLOW LIKE DON'T. THEY ARE. HAVE BEEN TESTED IN QUARANTINE IN A PUT BACK INTO THEIR COMMUNITIES. WITH SOME SAFETY. AND WE YOU KNOW. WE TILT I'M TOLD EVERYBODY'S WORKING ON THAT. IT WAS WILL MAKE IT HAPPEN. BUT IF WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON IT IT'S HAPPENING ALL AT THE SAME TIME WHICH IS REALLY KIND OF SCARY HOPE WE'LL GET SOME. A LITTLE BIT MORE STRUCTURE AND WHAT WE'RE DOING THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS CARLY. A GOOD MORNING THAT QUESTION FOR THE ADMINISTRATION HAS THERE BEEN ANY ANALYSIS OF SAVINGS FROM REFORMING- POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS SUCH AS- HEALTH BENEFITS I'VE HEARD- ESTIMATES THAT WE COULD SAVE BILLIONS IF WE JUST HAD- THEM STRUCTURED IN A WAY THAT WAS ON PAR WITH SOME OF OUR FRIENDS IN THE WESTERN STATES PACKED LIKE COLORADO AND OREGON IS THAT SOME OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S LOOKED AT. SO THOSE TYPES OF CHANGES ARE NOT CONTEMPLATED IN OUR MAY REVISION- THAT DATA IN ADDED AT A GENERAL LEVEL IS AVAILABLE YOU KNOW BOTH. IN SOME OF OUR DOCUMENTS AS WELL AS IN CALIFORNIA IS A COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT- BUT IN TERMS OF THE SPECIFICS- I'D HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON MORE DETAILS WHAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE. I IS IF THE LA- STILL HERE IS THIS I MEAN THAT YOU'VE LOOKED AT. HELLO YES- WE HAVE WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT THAT QUESTION OVER TIME AND- IT IS VERY COMPLICATED I THINK THAT IN GENERAL THE- BENEFITS THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED. OVER TIME- YOU KNOW YOU- TYPICALLY- CHANGES TO THE BENEFIT PACKAGE WOULD. FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT THE SAFEST WAY TO APPROACH IT WOULD BE TO MAKE CHANGES TO FUTURE EMPLOYEES RATHER THAN EXISTING BENEFITS. BUT THERE IS SOME LEGAL QUESTION ABOUT HOW MUCH. THE WAY THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE TO REDUCE BENEFITS PARTICULARLY FOR- EXISTING RETIREES SO- YOU KNOW IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE COULD WE COULD WORK WITH YOU YOU AND YOUR STAFF TO PROVIDE A MORE DETAILED RESPONSE IF YOU WOULD LIKE BUT- YOU KNOW. IT EIGHT. SORRY I HAD. NICE GOING TO SAY I MEAN IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A FAIRLY COMPLICATED ISSUE THAT HAS SOME- QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF CHANGING BENEFIT LEVELS AND PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO HOW THE STATE HAS APPROACH TO FINDING THE BENEFIT IN RECENT YEARS- ASKING EMPLOYEES TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE BENEFIT US YOU KNOW COULD COULD SET UP A AN ARGUMENT THAT THE- BENEFIT IS MORE DIFFICULT TO CHANGE- RETROACTIVELY SO- IS FAIRLY. COMPLEX I THINK TO PUT IT BLUNTLY. SURE WELL I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT- IF NOT PART OF THIS BUDGET I MEAN I EVEN IF IT'S JUST FOR ON A FORWARD GOING BASIS THERE ARE SUCH A STANCE ALL SAVINGS HERE AND I YOU KNOW THE LEVEL OF THAT WERE SUBSIDIZING RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT EVEN CLEAR HOW MUCH OF VALUE IT PROVIDES TO THE RETIREES IN TERMS OF THEI HEALTH AND WELL BEING AND FINANCIAL SECURITY- DOES MAKE ONE COMMENT ON THE ISSUE OF EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY AYE AYE AT THAT SPENDING FLEXIBILITY AYE. I AGREE ACTUALLY WITH DOCTOR WEBER AND- MISTER MCCARTY- IT IN AS MUCH AS THERE IS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE CONCENTRATION FUNDING FOR LCF OUT FOR WE HAVE PROVIDED A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF STATE EDUCATION DOLLARS TO DISTRICTS THAT HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF UNDERSERVED STUDENTS AND IT'S- WE'VE SEEN THAT THAT FUNDING HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN TARGETED AT THE STUDENTS IT'S MEANT FOR- IT IN THE WAY THAT WILL ACTUALLY LEAD TO A CLOSING EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT GAPS AND THAT'S WHY I'VE SUPPORTED DR WEBER'S EFFORTS. TO TRY TO BRING- GREATER OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY THAT PROCESS THAT ON THE OTHER HAND THERE ARE SOME RESTRICTIONS OF GENERAL FLEXIBILITY THAT TO ME DON'T SEEM PARTICULARLY WELL GROUNDED WHICH I YOU KNOW MISTER MCCARTY ALLUDED TO A COUPLE OF THEM I'VE HEARD ABOUT- THE FUN DEALING WITH THAT IS BOTH SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS I AND STUDENTS WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WHERE THERE ARE RESTRICTIONS- OR EVEN POTENTIALLY DEVELOPMENT FEES- AND THAT SORT OF THING SO IF WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT THIS. THROUGH NOT JUST THE LANDS OF- YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT'S BEING PROVIDED BUT ALSO- THE VALUE THAT FUNDING PROVIDES- YOU KNOW LIFTING RESTRICTIONS WHERE THEY DON'T NEED TO EXIST- IS ONE WAY THAT YOU CAN ADD VALUE I WITHOUT HAVING TO HAVE EXTRA DOLLARS AND FRANKLY I WOULD EXTEND TO THAT POINT TO A MUCH BROADER SWATH OF EDUCATION POLICY AND WE HAVE A VERY THICK EDUCATION CODE. THAT HAS A LOT OF. MANDATES ARE NOT NECESSARILY AT THAT ARE DONE ARE REALLY NECESSARY FOR DISTRICTS AND THE REASON WE KNOW THAT IS BECAUSE THERE'S A PARTICULAR. A SUBSET OF OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM THAT ISN'T SUBJECT TO A LOT OF THOSE MANDATES THE CHARTER SECTOR. SO IF WE COULD THINK ABOUT WAYS TO PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY IN THAT SENSE WHERE WE'RE NOT. HAVING SO MANY MANDATES IMPOSED ON DISTRICTS THEN THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER WAY THAT I THINK WE CAN ALLOW THEM TO DO THEIR JOB OF. OF PROMOTING STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT BETTER- I HAD A TIME WHEN WE DON'T HAVE AS MUCH FUNDING TO BRING TO THE TABLE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. OKAY THEN I'M GONNA GET TO MY QUESTIONS I JUST GOING TO GO ON CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE DIFFERENCES IN STRUCTURAL DEFICITS BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE'S PROPOSAL AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL- AS A- AND ALSO WHEN WE GET THE FOURTEEN BILLION. AND WHEN WE DON'T GET THE FOURTEEN DAY. ONCE YOU. YES MISTER KING I KNOW I KNOW THAT- UNDER THE MAY REVISION AS WE FIRST LOOKED AT IT THERE WERE- STRUCTURAL DEFICITS IN THE SEVERAL BILLIONS OF DOLLARS RANGE. AND THEN THERE IS ACTUALLY SOME INCREASE IN THE FINAL YEAR OF THE MULTIPLE YOUR OUTLOOK IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AT THAT POINT IT WOULD INCREASE TO- AROUND SIXTEEN BILLION PARTLY BECAUSE SOME OF THE REVENUE PROVISION ANDS. WOULD HAVE DROPPED OFF BY THEN AND SOME OTHER CHANGES THAT WERE OR WERE PROPOSED IN THE MAY REVISION. I MUST SAY I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE SEEN A MULTIPLE YEAR- I HAVE NOT SEEN A MULTIPLE YEAR OUTLOOK FOR- THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE AT THIS TIME SO I THINK THAT'S A DISCUSSION THAT YOU KNOW WE COULD CONTINUE TO HAVE WITH THAT WITH THE DATA YOU KNOW WITH SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. GREAT AND THEN WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL DO YOU ALSO FACTOR IN ALL THE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF LAYOFFS WOULD HAVE TO DO BECAUSE OF ALL THE BUDGET CUTS IN TERMS OF TEACHERS. ON IN HEALTH POOR SERVICE CARE GIVERS PEOPLE WHO STAFF THESE ADULT DAY HEALTH CENTERS- ALL ALL THE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO- WORK THE- DDS CENTERS WHAT WAS THAT A FACTOR IN YOUR IN THE IN THE ANALYSIS THAT IS A- VERY. GOOD QUESTION AND IT REASONABLE CONCERN BUT THAT'S AND THAT IS- KIND OF A- AN EFFECTIVE THE PROPOSAL THAT WE DID NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT IN OUR INITIAL ANALYSIS OF THE OF THE PACKAGE. WHAT WOULD BE A FAIR ASSUMPTION THAT TERM. YOU KNOW YOU KNOW UNEMPLOYMENT CASELOAD AS WELL AS ALL THE DIFFERENT TIME ONE CASELOAD PROGRAMS WOULD. GO UP BECAUSE OF THOSE MAILS. FOR THE PEOPLE AFFECTED BY BY THAT- YEAH I THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO THINK THAT THEY MAY IN SOME CASES YES BE BE- NEEDING TO UTILIZE THOSE KIND OF SERVICES YES. GREAT THANK YOU TO JUST GO BACK TO OUR DEPARTMENT FINANCE- LOOKING AT THE FOUR BILLION DOLLAR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MEDI CAL. CAL WORKS- CASELOAD ASSUMPTIONS. BECAUSE OF THAT- BECAUSE OF THE HUGE INCREASING CASELOADS IN YOUR PROPOSAL THAT DROVE MANY OF THE BUDGET CUTS AND HUMAN SERVICES AND THE- PUBLIC HEALTH AREA SO IF THE ASSUMPTION WAS INCORRECT AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE- CASE LOAD. THE U. IT ANTICIPATED WHAT WOULD BE DONE WITH THE MONEY THE SAFETY. SO IF IT TURNS OUT THAT EXPENSES ARE LOWER THAN WE ARE PROJECTING THEN THAT MONEY IT CERTAINLY WOULDN'T GO AWAY IT WOULD SIMPLY- ROLLING TO THE NEXT YEAR FOR APPROPRIATION BY THE LEGISLATURE. SUSAN RESERVE. YEAH IT WOULD BE- THE- AND ASSUMING EVERYTHING ELSE WAS EXACTLY HOW WE PROJECTED IT- THE AND YOUR BALANCE- SO THE KERRY AND SURPLUS- WOULD BE THAT MUCH HIGHER BY HOWEVER MANY BILLION DOLLARS- THEN WE ARE PROJECTING. I SHOULD NOTE THOUGH AS WE ALL KNOW THAT. FOR THE YEAR AFTER THIS YEAR- WE ARE CURRENTLY PROJECTING A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT OF SEVERAL BILLION DOLLARS SO IT WOULD MORE ABOUT THE FACT IF EVERYTHING WERE TO GO WAS WE'RE PROJECTING. OF REDUCING THE SIZE OF THAT STRUCTURAL DEFICIT RATHER THAN CREATING A SURPLUS. GAGAN BUT THE SAME TIME. THE ONE THE ONE IMPACT WE WOULD HAVE THIS. MANY OF THE SERVICES THAT WERE PROPOSED CUTS WOULD BE CUT SEE YOU WOULD HAVE SENIORS WHO WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GET MEALS YOU HAVE SENIORS COULDN'T GET. HELP AT HOME YOU HAVE- PEOPLE WHO WORKED RELY ON MEDI CAL COULDN'T ACCESS MANY OF THESE ADDITIONAL SERVICES LIKE DENTAL CARE A DIFFERENT OPTIONAL BENEFITS- PICNIC THEY COULDN'T GET THOSE SO THAT THE PART WE WOULD KNOW FOR CERTAIN. THAT'S CORRECT SO ON. ONE ONE THING AS WE AS WE TALKED ABOUT AND I THINK MISS MCCARTY FRIEND A VERY WELL. IS WE- NONE OF US KNOW WHERE THE ECONOMY'S GOING I THINK I THINK THE ONLY THING WE KNOW FOR. EVERY BUDGET THAT WE PUT TOGETHER IS WHATEVER WE WHATEVER BUDGET WE PUT TOGETHER IS GOING TO BE WRONG. IT'S AN IT'S NEVEREXACTLY AS WE PROTECT WE OBVIOUSLY WANT TO INSURE. THAT WE ARE BEING- FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE. BUT I THINK THE QUESTION ISIN ORDER TO PROTECT OUR BOND RATING WE HAVE SNOW INTO CALIFORNIANS WHO. CAN'T GET ACCESS TO FOOD CAN'T GET ACCESS TO HOUSING- HAVE- CHALLENGES GETTING HEALTH CARE ACCESS IN I THINK WE ARE TRYING TO- TO SOME EXTENT. BROUGH SAY IT'S OKAY THAT IF. WE HAVE A LOWER BOND RATING IN ORDER TO PROTECT. THOSE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS I THINK THAT'S WHERE I WOULD SAY IS- ONE OF THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCES IN IN OUR BUDGET THAT WE ARE. ASSUMING GREATER- FINANCIAL RISK. FOR THE MILLING TO CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE ABLE TO SAY FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS CAN'T GET ACCESS TO CREDIT CAN BORROW ANY MONEY CAN'T ASSUME. ANY OF THAT- ANY OF THE FINANCIAL RISK. I THINK GOING BACK TO THE- SISTER BUT DOCTOR WEBER SAID ABOUT THE STATE PRISON CLOSURE- WE DID IT- PUT FORWARD- TRAILER BILL- WE REALLY HOPE THAT- THAT WE CAN FIND A FIND A PATH TO AGREEMENT ON THAT TRAILER BILL. I KNOW THAT ONE OF OUR- ONE OF ONE OF THE POINTS OF FOCUS WE HAD IN THAT TRAILER BILL. WAS TO ENSURE THAT THEIR WORK COST SAVINGS THAT IF WE WERE GOING TO DO THE TO PRISON CLOSURES. THAT WE WERE ALSO GONNA HAVE COST SAVINGS BUT ALSO HAVE MINIMUM IMPACT TO BOTH THE WORKERS BUT ALSO TO THE FAMILIES OF THE INMATES AS WELL. AND WE REALLY HOPE THAT- THAT WE CAN FIND AN AGREEMENT NO THE ADMINISTRATION SHARES SHARES IS EXACT SAME GOALS. AS THE- THE WAY THE TRAILER BILL PUTS WRITTEN BUT WE HOPE THAT WE CAN. HAVE A CONVERSATION OF THAT. BUT I THINK. OVER ALL. WHERE AS AS WE PUT TOGETHER THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS BUDGET- YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO KIND OF IMAGINE THE WORLD BEFORE. MOVE IT BUT IF WE THINK ABOUT WHERE WE WERE IN FEBRUARY. I THINK IT'S A GOOD REMINDER WE WERE AT FULL UNEMPLOYMENT. BUT YET WE HAD MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO. NEVER HOW. FULL EMPLOYMENT FOR DOES A UNEMPLOYMENT I'M SORRY EXCUSE OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT CORRECTION- WE HAVE WE HAVE FULL WE HAVE FULL EMPLOYMENT- BE AT THE SAME TIME WE HAD MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO NEVER- REALLY RECOVERED FROM THE LAST RECESSION AND I THINK. THAT IS- MAINLY DUE TO MANY THE DEVASTATING CUTS TO OUR SOCIAL SAFETY NET PROGRAMS THAT- MANY MANY FAMILIES RELY ON A AND BECAUSE OF THAT- BECAUSE OF THOSE CUTS WE HAD SOME OF THE LARGEST INCOME INEQUALITY AT THE WE'VE EVER SEEN IN THE STATE'S HISTORY. THIS STATE HAS TRADITIONALLY ALWAYS BEEN A STATE WHERE WE'VE HAD VERY A VERY STRONG MIDDLE CLASS WE'VE HAD PROSPERITY FOR PEOPLE WHO'VE COME FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY OR THE PARTS OF THE WORLD TO REALLY COME HERE WITH A NOT A WHOLE LOT TO BE ABLE TO FINANCIALLY SUCCEED. IT IS HARDER EVERY DAY FOR PEOPLE WHO COME HERE BUT ALSO FOR THE PEOPLE WHO GREW UP HERE TECHNICALLY TO CD AND I THINK PART OF THAT IS THE SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ARE- BUDGET PUTS TOGETHER WAS REALLY HAMPERED IN THE LAST RECESSION. SO I THINK WHAT WE WANTED TO DO WAS BEFORE. WE ARE MAKE THESE DEVASTATING CUTS. THAT ARE BASED ON FISCAL ASSUMPTIONS THAT AGAIN NONE OF US KNOW HOW ACCURATE. THEY WILL BE A IS TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T DO THOSE CUTS UNTIL WE ABSOLUTELY. HAVE TO DO THEM. WE'RE AT A POINT WHERE THE ECONOMY IS STARTING TO RE OPEN. WE HOPE IT WILL RE OPEN- WITHOUT ANOTHER SPIKE IN COVERT CASES- BUT WE DON'T KOW- AND IF NOT- WITHOUT A CURSE THE HOPE IS THAT PERHAPS- WE'RE GOING TO BE IN A BETTER ECONOMIC SITUATION. THEN I WILL HAVE PROJECTED DEPARTMENT FINEST PROJECT I KNOW THAT'S WHAT WE ALL HOPE FOR WE'RE NOT HOPING FOR A DIRE PREDICTION. SO AND GET ON HOPES OF THAT I THINK IT MAKES SENSE IN JUNE. TWO NOT PULL THE BUTTON BECAUSE ONCE YOU CUT THESE PROGRAMS. THE VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO BRING BACK- WE CAN IF THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO GO BAD WE OBVIOUSLY CAN REVISIT THESE DISCUSSIONS IN AUGUST. I MEASURE WILL BE REVISITING ISSUE THESE ISSUES IN JANUARY WHEN WE COME BACK TO SESSION. I THINK THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME TO REACT TO THE SITUATION TO. DO WHAT WE THINK IS BEST AT THE TIME THAT WE DO THEM. SO I REALLY WOULD JUST URGE. THE AS WE GO IN THIS DISCUSSION. TO JUST THINK VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT- THESE CUTS BEFORE YOU DO THAT BECAUSE ONCE YOU DO THEM AGAIN. EVEN IF THE PROJECTIONS- COME IN MUCH MORE OPTIMISTIC THAN WE HAD PREVIOUSLY HOPED- YOU CAN'T JUST BRING BACK TEACHERS TO BEEN LAID OFF BECAUSE THEY'RE GONE. YOU CAN'T JUST BRING BACK THESE PROGRAMS TO START AT THE TAKES A YEARS OFTENTIMES TO START UP THESE PROGRAMS AGAIN. SO AGAIN- I THINK IT IS IT IS IMPORTANT I THINK WE HAVE PUT TOGETHER. A FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE BUDGET--BECAUSE WE'VE WAITED THE COST OF NOT HELPING THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO WOULD GO WOULD GO HUNGRY WOULD GO ON SHELTER- WOULD REALLY BE IN DIRE NEED WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE THAT WE COULD. PROVIDE THE SO WITH THAT I SEE A DARK MIST MISTER BLOOM HAS SOME THANKS IF I COULD JUST ASK A QUICK QUESTION WHICH I HOPE WILL BE INFORMATIVE- HOW ARE ACTUAL REVENUES DOING COMPARED TO THOSE. PROJECTED IN THE MAY REFLECTS. SO I HAVE- J. CHAMBERLAIN ON THE LINE WHO COULD SPEAK TO IN TERMS OF JUST THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS I SHOULD CLARIFY THAT THE REAL- WE'LL GET A BETTER SENSE ON JULY FIFTEENTH BECAUSE THAT'S THE APRIL FIFTEENTH- PUSH THREE MONTHS FORWARD- BUT J. CHAMBER ONE CAN SPEAK TO THAT EVERY MONTH WE MOVE FORWARD IT. BECOMES MORE ACCURATE. HI MA'AM THIS IS KATE CHAMBERLAIN OUT ARMED FINANCE. SO NAY REVENUES CAME AND- HIGHER AND I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT NUMBERS YOU WANT ME TO HIM AND HIGHER THAN THEM WITH PROJECTED ARE STILL DOWN A VERY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE PRIOR YEAR- BUT THROUGHOUT NINETEEN. BUT OKAY BUT THE TO ME TO MAKE THE PAYMENT STRONGER THAN WE PROJECTED. THAT'S RATHER VAGUE CAN YOU A CARE OF US LIKE AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE I HAD AND I CAN FALL. I OF ROUGHLY IT'S ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVER OUR- PROJECTION I THINK IT WAS IT WAS PRIMARILY WITHHOLDING CAME IN STRONGER THEN WE HAD pDECIMATED. THANK I WON'T HOLD YOU TO THE PRECISE. A NUMBER BUT I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. JUST TO FOLLOW UP THAT SIR YOU DO THESE ARE JUST THE CAR FRONT THAT'S INCOME TAX WITHHOLDINGS. THAT'S CORRECT DO BILL. WITH ALL. THANK YOU I THINK MISTER BLOOM HAS TO QUESTION I WAS THINKING ABOUT SO I APPRECIATE THAT THE QUESTION IN AGAIN I THINK IT DEMONSTRATES- THE POINT TO INSURE THAT WE HAVE TO- MAKE SURE WERE ONLY CUTTING THINGS WHEN WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO CUT THESE PROGRAMS I WANT A SITUATION WHERE THESE FAMILIES ARE IN DIRE NEED. AT A TIME WHEN PEOPLE NEED GOVERNMENT THE MOST OUR RESOURCESARE SHRINKING BUT IT YOU KNOW IT MAKES SENSE THAT WE NOT CUT THESE PROGRAMS AND TO WE ABSOLUTELY ARE CERTAIN THAT WE HAVE TO SET. UP WITH THAT SEEING NO OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS I WAS GOING TO GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT IF THERE'S ANYONE HERE. PLEASE COME TO THE PLEASE COME TO THE MICROPHONE- YEAH PLEASE COME ONE AT A TIME THERE'S NO NEED TO LINE UP. IS IT IS IT ON GO AHEAD IT IS ON OKAY- MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CHRISTMAS KAYLEE ON BEHALF OF THE COMPUTING TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION- IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO THE REVENUE GENERATING PROPOSALS. THAT IS THE NET OPERATING LOSS DEDUCTION SUSPENSION AS WELL AS A LIMITATION ON TAX CREDIT USAGE. I WANT TO RAISE A COUPLE OF ISSUES FIRST AND FOREMOST. WHETHER YOU IN ACTED ON THE FIFTEENTH OR AT SOME OTHER POINT IT IS RETROACTIVE TO JANUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR. SO MANY COMPANIES WHO WERE ANTICIPATING USAGE OF THOSE CREDITS HER AND A WELL DEDUCTIONS WILL BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. SECOND IN ORDER TO PAY THE FOUR PLUS BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S ESTIMATED TO BE GENERATED BY THESE TWO PROVISIONS. IT REQUIRES BUSINESSES TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT CASH FLOW BECAUSE INSTEAD OF. A REDUCED TAX BILL FROM THAT AND A WELL DEDUCTION INDOOR TAX CREDIT USAGE THEY'LL NEED THE CASH TO PAY THAT HIGHER BILL. THIRD THESE ARE UNPRECEDENTED THERE THREE YEARS OF SUSPENSION WHICH WE THINK IS ON WARRANTED AT THIS STAGE. AND LASTLY ON THE CREDIT USAGE THE BIGGEST IMPACT IS ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AS MISTER COOPER- NOTICED EARLIER TODAY. AND I WOULD POINT OUT THAT IN ORDER TO GENERATE THAT CREDIT. YOU HAVE TO DO VERY SPECIALIZED RESEARCH PURSUANT TO FEDERAL LAW IT HAS TO OCCUR WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND MOST OF THE CREDIT IS GENERATED BY WAGES PAID TO THOSE WORKERS INVOLVED IN THAT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR THOSE REASONS WE URGE YOU TO REJECT THOSE PROPOSALS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.
