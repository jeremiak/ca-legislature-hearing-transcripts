00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:39.772
SHALL BE SOLD FOR NO LESS THAN

00:15:39.838 --> 00:15:42.174
THE ORIGINAL PRICE. SO THE NINE

00:15:42.241 --> 00:15:43.909
MILLION DOLLARS IS NOT DIG

00:15:43.976 --> 00:15:46.078
CEILING. IT'S THE FLOOR IS THAT

00:15:46.145 --> 00:15:48.080
THE AUTHORS UNDERSTANDING. AS

00:15:48.147 --> 00:15:50.015
THANK YOU SENATOR Y. CASKEY M.

00:15:50.082 --> 00:15:51.317
FOR THAT CLARIFICATION. THE

00:15:51.383 --> 00:15:52.284
BILL MERELY SAYS THE LAND

00:15:52.351 --> 00:15:56.322
SHOULD BE SOLD FOR NO LESS THAN

00:15:56.388 --> 00:15:56.922
THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE PRICE AS

00:15:56.989 --> 00:15:57.556
YOU POINTED OUT SO NINE MILLION

00:15:57.623 --> 00:15:59.525
IS THEM. AND THEN THEY WILL GET

00:15:59.591 --> 00:16:00.092
BUT THEY CAN ABSOLUTELY GET

00:16:00.159 --> 00:16:01.193
MORE. I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.495
THIS IS AN EXTREMELY RURAL PART

00:16:03.562 --> 00:16:05.097
OF OUR DISTRICT THAT IS OWNED

00:16:05.164 --> 00:16:07.032
IN A WAY THAT IS NOT AMENABLE

00:16:07.099 --> 00:16:08.467
TO. DEVELOPMENT OR ANYTHING

00:16:08.534 --> 00:16:09.702
THAT WOULD BRING IT TO THE

00:16:09.768 --> 00:16:11.203
PURCHASE PRICE OF LAND

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:12.938
ELSEWHERE IN THE BAY AREA BUT-

00:16:13.005 --> 00:16:14.273
THE BILL WOULD NOT STOP PARKS

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:15.607
FROM SELLING FOR MORE THAN THE

00:16:15.674 --> 00:16:17.209
ORIGINAL PURCHASE. NOW ALSO I

00:16:17.276 --> 00:16:18.577
THINK YOUR OPENING YOU TALKED

00:16:18.644 --> 00:16:19.945
ABOUT THIS IS A MERE

00:16:20.012 --> 00:16:22.147
AUTHORIZATION FOR TSG TO GO AND

00:16:22.214 --> 00:16:24.249
SO THIS IS WE WOULD ANTICIPATE

00:16:24.316 --> 00:16:25.617
THAT THERE WOULD BE.

00:16:25.684 --> 00:16:27.386
NEGOTIATIONS ON THE ACTUAL

00:16:27.453 --> 00:16:28.520
SALES PRICE IS THAT YOUR

00:16:28.587 --> 00:16:30.055
UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THIS BILL

00:16:30.122 --> 00:16:32.358
WOULD WORK. YES AND ALSO POINT

00:16:32.424 --> 00:16:33.592

00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:36.028
OPPOSITE AND- LOCAL ABOUT THE

00:16:36.095 --> 00:16:39.264

THE ADMINISTRATION AND THIS

00:16:39.898 --> 00:16:40.632
BILL IS MERELY AN OPTION FOR

00:16:40.699 --> 00:16:41.467
THEM TO STOP. WE ARE NOT.

00:16:41.533 --> 00:16:42.101
MANDATING ANYTHING AND SO THEY

00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:43.769
WERE TAKING THE AUTHORITY THAT.

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:44.670
THE OPPOSITION WOULD LIKE TO

00:16:44.737 --> 00:16:46.705
SEE EVEN IF THIS BILL PASSES.

00:16:46.772 --> 00:16:48.874
CURRENT LAW CURRENT. LAW IS A

00:16:48.941 --> 00:16:50.743

00:17:05.624 --> 00:17:08.427
DISTRICT AND THE- CITY SAN JOSE

00:17:08.494 --> 00:17:10.462
FOR RECREATIONAL PURPOSES. THE

00:17:10.529 --> 00:17:12.564
STATE LAW CURRENTLY ALLOWS FOR

00:17:12.631 --> 00:17:15.200
DISCOUNT IF THE PURCHASE THAT

00:17:15.267 --> 00:17:16.835
IS GOING TO BE FOR PUBLIC USE.

00:17:16.902 --> 00:17:17.636
AND THERE'S GONNA BE A

00:17:17.703 --> 00:17:20.205
RECREATIONAL ELEMENT OR PARKS

THIS I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT

00:17:27.946 --> 00:17:29.415
PART OF A LOT BUT- I MEAN THIS

00:17:29.481 --> 00:17:31.450
WOULD NOT ALLOWED FOR. THIS

00:17:31.517 --> 00:17:33.285
WOULD NOT ALLOW FOR TO BE SOLD

STATE LAW. ALLOWS WHEN YOU'RE

00:17:43.629 --> 00:17:45.431

OF THE DESIRABILITY WE HAVE AN

00:17:50.769 --> 00:17:53.806
OPEN SPACE. UNFORTUNATELY IT

00:17:53.872 --> 00:17:54.573

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.707
DESCRIPTORS JOB. DISTRICTS

00:17:55.774 --> 00:17:56.742

00:18:25.971 --> 00:18:28.273
ON THAT SENATOR WHICH IS IT

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:29.808
GETTING BACK TO THAT WHAT THE

00:18:29.875 --> 00:18:31.109
ACTUAL AMOUNT HAS BEEN THAT

00:18:31.176 --> 00:18:33.178
WE'VE SPENT OVER LAST TWENTY

COMMENT REGARDING LITIGATION SO

00:20:05.003 --> 00:20:06.572
THE LITIGATION DOESN'T GO AWAY

00:20:06.638 --> 00:20:08.707
EVEN IF THE STATE DIVEST ITSELF

00:20:08.774 --> 00:20:09.841
OF THE OWNERSHIP IS THAT

00:20:09.908 --> 00:20:12.044
CORRECT. ACTUALLY I DON'T KNOW

00:20:15.347 --> 00:20:17.215
IMPORTANT I THINK IN TERMS OF

00:20:17.282 --> 00:20:18.951
THE FUTURE OF THE PROPERTY AND

00:20:19.017 --> 00:20:20.686
WHOMEVER WOULD ACQUIRE IT

00:20:20.752 --> 00:20:22.487
THROUGH A PURCHASE THE SECOND

00:20:22.554 --> 00:20:23.855
THING THAT TROUBLES ME OF

00:20:23.922 --> 00:20:25.023
COURSE IS THE PROCESS WHICH WAS

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:26.758
BROUGHT OUT BECAUSE IT HASN'T

00:20:26.825 --> 00:20:28.093
ALLOWED THOSE WHO HAVE A

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.195
PROBLEM WITH. THE MANNER IN

00:20:30.262 --> 00:20:32.364
WHICH IS GOING FORWARD I TO

00:20:32.431 --> 00:20:33.865
HAVE THEIR SAY SO I JUST WANT

00:20:33.932 --> 00:20:35.500
TO PUT THAT ON THE RECORD AND

00:20:35.567 --> 00:20:37.603
FINALLY ON IN OUR ANALYSIS

00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:39.271
THERE IS A CONCERN ABOUT THEM

00:20:39.338 --> 00:20:40.739
HAVING THERE'S NO REVERSION

00:20:40.806 --> 00:20:43.141
CLAUSE WHICH MEANS THAT IF IT

00:20:43.208 --> 00:20:47.346
WASN'T SOLD DATA IF IT WAS SOLD

00:20:47.412 --> 00:20:47.813
THAT THERE WOULD BE A

00:20:47.879 --> 00:20:51.583
PROHIBITION. OF FOR IT BEING

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:56.254
SOLD FROM THAT SECOND. JUST SIR

00:20:56.321 --> 00:20:57.255
TO A SECOND PURCHASER. WHO

00:20:57.322 --> 00:20:57.823
COULD THEN USE THAT FOR YOU

00:20:57.889 --> 00:20:58.624
KNOW PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT AND IT

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:00.425
SOUNDS TO ME LIKE. YOU YOU

00:21:00.492 --> 00:21:01.326
ADDRESS THAT KIND OF BY SAYING

00:21:01.393 --> 00:21:02.894
IT SO RURAL THAT WOULD BE A

00:21:02.961 --> 00:21:05.631
VERY. FAR STRETCH. THIS IS

00:21:05.697 --> 00:21:06.264
GOING TO COME OUT THERE AND YOU

00:21:06.331 --> 00:21:07.566
KNOW BUILDING. FOUR HUNDRED

00:21:07.633 --> 00:21:09.101
UNIT. AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:21:09.167 --> 00:21:11.003
ANYWAY. BUT TO THOSE ARE

00:21:11.069 --> 00:21:13.005
CONCERNS OF MINE SO I WILL NOT

00:21:13.071 --> 00:21:14.172
BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT TODAY BUT

00:21:14.239 --> 00:21:15.907
I CERTAINLY I. WILL WATCH IT

00:21:15.974 --> 00:21:17.709
CLOSELY GOING FORWARD BECAUSE I

00:21:17.776 --> 00:21:19.077
THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO

00:21:19.144 --> 00:21:21.246
HAVE. CONSERVATION LANDS ON

00:21:21.313 --> 00:21:22.581
THERE ARE PARTNERED WITH THOSE

00:21:22.648 --> 00:21:24.883
THAT ARE VERY ACTIVE. BY THE

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:26.218
WAY WE HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT

00:21:26.284 --> 00:21:28.654
SITUATION AND MY DISTRICT. IN

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.656
THE SOUTHERLY PART OF IT WHERE

00:21:30.722 --> 00:21:31.723
WE HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME THING

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:33.859
AND CONSERVATION. A LARGE PIECE

00:21:33.925 --> 00:21:35.627
OF PROPERTY THAT WAS CONSERVE.

00:21:35.694 --> 00:21:38.263
OUR FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PURPOSES

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:39.865
MITIGATION PURPOSES AND ALSO

00:21:39.931 --> 00:21:42.634
PARTNERED WITH. AN AREA THAT IS

00:21:42.701 --> 00:21:43.902
FOR OFF ROADING AND WHAT'S

00:21:43.969 --> 00:21:45.103
HAPPENED IS THERE'S BEEN A

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:48.106
DEGRADATION. OF THE

00:21:48.173 --> 00:21:49.207
CONSERVATION PART BUT THERE'S

00:21:49.274 --> 00:21:56.148
ALSO BEEN A ARE TRICKS AND- ON

00:21:56.214 --> 00:21:56.748
THE PROMISES THAT WERE MADE ON

00:21:56.815 --> 00:22:01.853
TO THOSE TWO. SO IT'S NOT AN

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:02.454
EASY IS NOT AN EASY

US THIS INFORMATION. I'M

00:22:32.584 --> 00:22:33.652
WONDERING IF IT WOULD BE

00:22:33.719 --> 00:22:34.319
APPROPRIATE FOR THE MOTION

00:22:34.386 --> 00:22:36.221

AND CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION

00:22:52.971 --> 00:22:54.673
WHICH I THINK WOULD LEAD TO A

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:57.876
MORE POSITIVE DIALOGUE BETWEEN

00:22:57.943 --> 00:23:00.979

00:23:05.717 --> 00:23:06.585
NOT CARE WITHDRAW MY MOTION.

00:23:06.651 --> 00:23:07.385
ALTHOUGH I THINK THE YOUR

00:23:07.452 --> 00:23:08.520
COMMENTS WOULD GO TO THE ACTUAL

00:23:08.587 --> 00:23:10.255
COSTS BECAUSE OF FINANCE WOULD

00:23:10.322 --> 00:23:11.289
GIVE AGAIN MORE ONLY

00:23:11.356 --> 00:23:13.492
AUTHORIZING DSG SO THERE'D

00:23:13.558 --> 00:23:14.693
FINANCES GET A FOLLOW UP

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.461
THEY'RE GOING TO GET. THIS IN

00:23:16.528 --> 00:23:18.196
FOR THIS INFORMATION AND THAT

00:23:18.263 --> 00:23:21.366
MAY AFFECT. A DEAL POINT I'M SO

00:23:21.433 --> 00:23:22.801
I WILL NOT WITHDRAW MY MOTION

00:23:22.868 --> 00:23:24.136
MISTER CHAIR OKAY NOW I WOULD

00:23:24.202 --> 00:23:26.171
JUST COMMENT THAT. WE'RE NOT

00:23:26.238 --> 00:23:27.906
MANDATING ANYTHING OTHER THAN

00:23:27.973 --> 00:23:29.307
ALLOWING A CONVERSATION TO

00:23:29.374 --> 00:23:31.309
CONTINUE. AND SO I THINK GIVEN

00:23:31.376 --> 00:23:33.779
THAT FACT THAT THIS IS JUST.

00:23:33.845 --> 00:23:35.847
FRANKLY AUTHORIZING PEOPLE O

00:23:35.914 --> 00:23:37.282
TALK. I DON'T SEE THE NEED TO

00:23:37.349 --> 00:23:39.818
HOLD COMMITTEE BECAUSE- WE

00:23:39.885 --> 00:23:40.452
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OUTCOME OF

00:23:40.519 --> 00:23:40.952
THAT CONVERSATION THAT

00:23:41.019 --> 00:23:44.022
DISUSSION. THE PRICES SAID AS

00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:46.992
A MINIMUM NOT A MAXIMUM. TGS

00:23:47.058 --> 00:23:49.594
STILL WILL APPROVE ANYTHING

00:23:49.661 --> 00:23:51.630
THAT. WOULD WOULD BE

00:23:51.696 --> 00:23:53.298
FORTHCOMING. SO I'M DOUBLE

00:23:53.365 --> 00:23:55.233
PUTTING THE PEOPLE OUT BECAUSE

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.369
I THINK IT JUST ENCOURAGES A

00:23:57.435 --> 00:24:03.575
CUT ALL THE RIGHT IS A CUT. IN

00:24:03.642 --> 00:24:08.280
LIKE POST. THAT THAT WE

00:24:08.346 --> 00:24:09.314

00:24:09.381 --> 00:24:10.415
PART OF THAT CONVERSATION

00:24:10.482 --> 00:24:12.317
THERE'S NO CONFLICTS WITH. THIS

00:24:12.384 --> 00:24:13.418
AUTHORIZATION THAT'S PROVIDED

00:24:13.485 --> 00:24:15.287
HERE THEY REASON THE BILLS HERE

00:24:15.353 --> 00:24:16.221
IS BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT SAYS

00:24:16.288 --> 00:24:16.655
THEY DON'T HAVE THE

00:24:16.721 --> 00:24:18.557

00:24:18.623 --> 00:24:21.793

THAT NOTHING IN THIS BILL OR

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:33.271
ANY. POTENTIAL SALE OF THE

00:24:33.338 --> 00:24:35.674

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:36.374
ABILITY FOR THOSE WHO ENJOY

00:24:36.441 --> 00:24:39.578
