00:17:32.184 --> 00:17:35.755 region:rollup2
COMMISSION AND WE ENDORSED WHAT

00:17:33.986 --> 00:17:37.723 region:rollup2
WE ARE THINKING OF US FACE ONE

00:17:35.755 --> 00:17:39.125 region:rollup2
WHICH REALLY CALLS FOR FIRST.

00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:40.893 region:rollup2
AND AS MR FIREMAN MENTIONED

00:17:39.125 --> 00:17:41.761 region:rollup2
INCREASING THE CAL GRANT BE

00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:43.462 region:rollup2
ACCESS AWARD.

00:17:41.761 --> 00:17:44.463 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY AIMS TO TACKLE SOME

00:17:43.462 --> 00:17:45.598 region:rollup2
OF THE ISSUES RELATED TO

00:17:44.463 --> 00:17:47.800 region:rollup2
AFFORDABILITY.

00:17:45.598 --> 00:17:49.335 region:rollup2
AND TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.970 region:rollup2
WERE ALSO LOOKING VERY MUCH OF

00:17:49.335 --> 00:17:52.438 region:rollup2
WHAT WE CAN DO IN THE NEAR TERM

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:54.407 region:rollup2
RELATED TO IMPROVINGI'M

00:17:52.438 --> 00:17:56.108 region:rollup2
FINANCIALLY OUTREACH AND EARLY

00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:57.910 region:rollup2
INFORMATION SO THAT FAMILIES AND

00:17:56.108 --> 00:17:59.612 region:rollup2
STUDENTS. KNOW MUCH MORE ABOUT

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:02.081 region:rollup2
THEIR FINANCIALLY OPPORTUNITIES

00:17:59.612 --> 00:18:03.015 region:rollup2
MUCH EARLIER ON AND I WILL SAY

00:18:02.081 --> 00:18:05.017 region:rollup2
THAT AS WE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS

00:18:03.015 --> 00:18:06.719 region:rollup2
WORK IT WAS IMPERATIVE TO ASK.

00:18:05.017 --> 00:18:08.521 region:rollup2
THAT WE CANNOT USE SOME DESIGN

00:18:06.719 --> 00:18:10.189 region:rollup2
THINKING PRINCIPLES IN THINKING

00:18:08.521 --> 00:18:11.424 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS THAT WE TEND TO I

00:18:10.189 --> 00:18:12.858 region:rollup2
THINK AT THE STATE LEVEL THINK

00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:13.526 region:rollup2
ABOUT WELL HOW ARE WE GONNA

00:18:12.858 --> 00:18:14.927 region:rollup2
ADMINISTER THINGS. AND WHICH ONE

00:18:13.526 --> 00:18:17.196 region:rollup2
TO PUT THAT ON ITS HEAD A LITTLE

00:18:14.927 --> 00:18:18.331 region:rollup2
BIT AND REALLY THINK ABOUT WHAT

00:18:17.196 --> 00:18:19.732 region:rollup2
IS A STUDENT CENTERED APPROACH.

00:18:18.331 --> 00:18:21.233 region:rollup2
SO THINKING ABOUT FINANCIAL AID

00:18:19.732 --> 00:18:22.335 region:rollup2
HOW WOULD HOW COULD IF WE START

00:18:21.233 --> 00:18:24.070 region:rollup2
WITH THE STUDENT AT THE CENTER

00:18:22.335 --> 00:18:26.105 region:rollup2
OF IT HOW WOULD THAT CHANGE HOW

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:27.974 region:rollup2
WE WOULD ADMINISTER. THIS ENTIRE

00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:29.809 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AND HOW WOULD THAT

00:18:27.974 --> 00:18:30.943 region:rollup2
CHANGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS. FROM

00:18:29.809 --> 00:18:32.478 region:rollup2
THE THIRD PIECE THAT THE

00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:34.013 region:rollup2
COMMISSION ENDORSE LAST WEEK WAS

00:18:32.478 --> 00:18:35.614 region:rollup2
REALLY AROUND AND INNOVATION

00:18:34.013 --> 00:18:37.483 region:rollup2
FUND WHICH WE MENTIONED WHICH IS

00:18:35.614 --> 00:18:38.851 region:rollup2
REALLY ALLOWS US TO THINK ABOUT

00:18:37.483 --> 00:18:40.853 region:rollup2
HOW CAN WE TEST.

00:18:38.851 --> 00:18:42.955 region:rollup2
HAVING CAMPUSES BE MUCH MORE

00:18:40.853 --> 00:18:43.956 region:rollup2
FLEXIBLE IN ADDRESSING VERY

00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:44.857 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC CHALLENGES THAT

00:18:43.956 --> 00:18:47.126 region:rollup2
STUDENTS FACE IN TERMS OF

00:18:44.857 --> 00:18:48.794 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AID.

00:18:47.126 --> 00:18:50.563 region:rollup2
STAGE TO WHICH WILL ENTERTAIN

00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:52.465 region:rollup2
AT OUR JUNE MEETING REALLY IS

00:18:50.563 --> 00:18:54.600 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON CONSOLIDATION AND

00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:55.935 region:rollup2
TAKING THE CAL GRANT A BNC AND

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.702 region:rollup2
THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP AND

00:18:55.935 --> 00:18:59.138 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT HOW TO WE

00:18:56.702 --> 00:19:01.440 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATE THOSE INTO ONE.

00:18:59.138 --> 00:19:03.209 region:rollup2
SIMPLE STREAMLINED PROGRAM OF

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.343 region:rollup2
THE IDEA IS TO MAKE FINANCIAL

00:19:03.209 --> 00:19:06.078 region:rollup2
AID MUCH MORE ACCESSIBLE TO

00:19:04.343 --> 00:19:06.946 region:rollup2
STUDENTS BUT ALSO TO THINK ABOUT

00:19:06.078 --> 00:19:08.581 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE  <u><c.green>SOME OF THE</c></u>

00:19:06.946 --> 00:19:11.150 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS BOTH AT

00:19:08.581 --> 00:19:11.784 region:rollup2
THE LEVEL OF THE CAMPUS. AS WELL

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:12.418 region:rollup2
AS AT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION

00:19:11.784 --> 00:19:14.220 region:rollup2
ITSELF.

00:19:12.418 --> 00:19:15.688 region:rollup2
THAT PROPOSAL REQUIRES A LOT

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:16.522 region:rollup2
MORE CONSIDERATION WE REALLY

00:19:15.688 --> 00:19:18.124 region:rollup2
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

00:19:16.522 --> 00:19:20.159 region:rollup2
CLEAR ABOUT ISSUES RELATED TO

00:19:18.124 --> 00:19:21.594 region:rollup2
THE CONSTRUCTION ELIGIBILITY AND

00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:22.828 region:rollup2
AWARD AMOUNTS. AND THAT WERE

00:19:21.594 --> 00:19:24.363 region:rollup2
ABLE TO INCORPORATE FEEDBACK

00:19:22.828 --> 00:19:26.465 region:rollup2
FROM VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS

00:19:24.363 --> 00:19:28.067 region:rollup2
INCLUDING STUDENTS THE SEGMENTS

00:19:26.465 --> 00:19:29.935 region:rollup2
AND OF COURSE LEGISLATORS.

00:19:28.067 --> 00:19:30.970 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE INTEND TO ISSUE A

00:19:29.935 --> 00:19:32.538 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE CONSOLIDATION

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:33.973 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL.

00:19:32.538 --> 00:19:34.206 region:rollup2
THE END OF OUR JUNE MEETING

00:19:33.973 --> 00:19:37.243 region:rollup2
WHICH.

00:19:34.206 --> 00:19:39.111 region:rollup2
WE HOPE THAT CAN BE ADOPTED IN.

00:19:37.243 --> 00:19:40.746 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT LEGISLATIVE CYCLE

00:19:39.111 --> 00:19:42.648 region:rollup2
OR FOR THE TWENTY NINETEEN

00:19:40.746 --> 00:19:44.717 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE CYCLE. THE THIRD

00:19:42.648 --> 00:19:46.085 region:rollup2
STAGE REALLY IS A SUBSTANTIAL

00:19:44.717 --> 00:19:47.586 region:rollup2
OVERHAUL OF OUR FINANCIALLY

00:19:46.085 --> 00:19:49.855 region:rollup2
SYSTEM BECAUSE THAT REALLY

00:19:47.586 --> 00:19:51.557 region:rollup2
SPEAKS TO A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO

00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:53.092 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING ISSUES RELATED TO THE

00:19:51.557 --> 00:19:54.360 region:rollup2
CAPITAL COST OF ATTENDANCE.

00:19:53.092 --> 00:19:55.327 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT THE REPORT THE

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.996 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL FROM THE CENTURY

00:19:55.327 --> 00:19:58.964 region:rollup2
FOUNDATION COULD BE TAKEN ON THE

00:19:56.996 --> 00:20:00.399 region:rollup2
TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY YEAR. AND

00:19:58.964 --> 00:20:02.201 region:rollup2
BY DOING THAT WE WOULD BOTH

00:20:00.399 --> 00:20:04.236 region:rollup2
TRIED TO DEAL WITH I'M COVERING

00:20:02.201 --> 00:20:06.138 region:rollup2
COSTS OF TUITION AND FEES AND

00:20:04.236 --> 00:20:07.440 region:rollup2
BEYOND THAT THINKING ABOUT. FOOD

00:20:06.138 --> 00:20:09.375 region:rollup2
AND HOUSING NEEDS WHICH WE KNOW

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.509 region:rollup2
ARE REALLY DRIVING THE COST OF

00:20:09.375 --> 00:20:12.044 region:rollup2
ATTENDANCE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:20:10.509 --> 00:20:14.013 region:rollup2
AND WE ALSO WANT TO FURTHER

00:20:12.044 --> 00:20:15.581 region:rollup2
STUDY THAT YOU HAVE SEEN MODEL

00:20:14.013 --> 00:20:17.049 region:rollup2
TO DETERMINE THE COST THAT

00:20:15.581 --> 00:20:18.050 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AID ELIGIBILITY.

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:19.251 region:rollup2
PROPOSED.

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:20.553 region:rollup2
BY THE CENTURY FOUNDATION

COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL AID

00:20:22.555 --> 00:20:26.158 region:rollup2
PROGRAM OF PROPOSAL THEN THAT

00:20:24.757 --> 00:20:27.426 region:rollup2
MEETS THE NEEDS.

00:20:26.158 --> 00:20:29.228 region:rollup2
AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE

00:20:27.426 --> 00:20:31.030 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE AND CONSIDERS ALL OF

00:20:29.228 --> 00:20:32.698 region:rollup2
THOSE THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:33.999 region:rollup2
ONCE WE'VE ADDED ALL OF THAT WE

00:20:32.698 --> 00:20:35.434 region:rollup2
WILL CERTAINLY BE RETURNING TO

00:20:33.999 --> 00:20:36.602 region:rollup2

00:28:08.153 --> 00:28:11.156 region:rollup2
TO SEE WHICH WAY IT WHICH.

00:28:09.454 --> 00:28:12.858 region:rollup2
INNOVATIVE PRACTICES REALLY

00:28:11.156 --> 00:28:13.926 region:rollup2
YIELD THE BEST RESULTS THE

00:28:12.858 --> 00:28:14.860 region:rollup2
COMMISSION COULD THEN REPORT

00:28:13.926 --> 00:28:16.595 region:rollup2
OUTCOME SO LEGISLATURE

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:18.597 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION ON ANY VALUABLE

00:28:16.595 --> 00:28:20.732 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE THAT. WE FIND.

00:28:18.597 --> 00:28:21.767 region:rollup2
REGARDING ANY STATEWIDE

00:28:20.732 --> 00:28:22.834 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT CAN BE SCALED.

00:28:21.767 --> 00:28:24.236 region:rollup2
THE COMMISSION WILL PROPOSE

00:28:22.834 --> 00:28:26.171 region:rollup2
STATUTORY BUDGET LANGUAGE FOR

00:28:24.236 --> 00:28:27.539 region:rollup2
CREATING A FUND FOR INNOVATION

00:28:26.171 --> 00:28:28.874 region:rollup2
IN COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY HOUSING

00:28:27.539 --> 00:28:30.342 region:rollup2
IS MINISTERED BY THIS TO NAY

00:28:28.874 --> 00:28:32.044 region:rollup2
COMMISSION SO THOSE ARE THE

00:28:30.342 --> 00:28:33.979 region:rollup2
PROGRAM THE THE THREE SORT OF

00:28:32.044 --> 00:28:34.913 region:rollup2
MAJOR RECOMMENDATIONS THAT. WE

00:28:33.979 --> 00:28:35.414 region:rollup2
THINK THAT WE IN THE SHORT RUN

00:28:34.913 --> 00:28:37.749 region:rollup2
CAN.

00:28:35.414 --> 00:28:40.218 region:rollup2
BEGIN WITH AND THEN AS OUR

00:28:37.749 --> 00:28:41.320 region:rollup2
CHAIR DISCUSSED THE SECOND FATE

00:28:40.218 --> 00:28:43.889 region:rollup2
WOULD BE REALLY LOOKING INTO THE

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:46.558 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATION OF THE ACTUAL.

00:28:43.889 --> 00:28:48.093 region:rollup2
CURRENT GRANT ADMINISTERED ST

00:28:46.558 --> 00:28:50.195 region:rollup2
GRADE MINISTERED PROGRAMS AND

00:28:48.093 --> 00:28:51.997 region:rollup2
THEN FUTURISTIC LEE NOT TOO FAR

00:28:50.195 --> 00:28:53.165 region:rollup2
OFF WE WOULD REALLY NEED TO WORK

00:28:51.997 --> 00:28:54.366 region:rollup2
WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS HIGHER ED

00:28:53.165 --> 00:28:56.168 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER

00:28:54.366 --> 00:28:57.769 region:rollup2
INTERESTED PARTIES. ON THE

00:28:56.168 --> 00:28:59.404 region:rollup2
ESTIMATED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION

00:28:57.769 --> 00:29:00.872 region:rollup2
AND WHAT SORT OF RATE THE COST

00:28:59.404 --> 00:29:02.374 region:rollup2
OF ATTENDANCE WHERE WHERE WE

00:29:00.872 --> 00:29:03.242 region:rollup2
SHOULD ACTUALLY PLACE THAT WE

00:29:02.374 --> 00:29:04.509 region:rollup2
DON'T FEEL LIKE WE'RE READY AT

00:29:03.242 --> 00:29:06.545 region:rollup2
THIS TIME TO OFFER YOUR

00:29:04.509 --> 00:29:07.145 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION ON THAT BUT WE

00:29:06.545 --> 00:29:07.512 region:rollup2
REALLY NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:29:07.145 --> 00:29:08.947 region:rollup2
TIME ON THOSE.

00:29:07.512 --> 00:29:10.916 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS.

00:29:08.947 --> 00:29:13.151 region:rollup2
I THINK. I WILL WILL HAVE A FEW

00:29:10.916 --> 00:29:15.487 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE REPORT AND

00:29:13.151 --> 00:29:16.822 region:rollup2
THAT FOLLOWED FOR YOU AND AND

00:29:15.487 --> 00:29:18.390 region:rollup2
HOW WE COULD AT ADDRESS IT.

00:29:16.822 --> 00:29:19.791 region:rollup2
YEARS TO COME GETS A THIS YEAR

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:22.394 region:rollup2
AS WELL BUT WE WANT TO GIVE THAT

00:29:19.791 --> 00:29:24.396 region:rollup2
SEGMENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO

RESPOND TO THIS. AYE WE WE WE

00:29:24.396 --> 00:29:28.133 region:rollup2
WERE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE THREE

00:29:26.031 --> 00:29:29.534 region:rollup2
SEGMENTS AS PART OF THIS GOING

00:29:28.133 --> 00:29:30.102 region:rollup2
IT'S A STUDENT COMMISSION.

00:29:29.534 --> 00:29:32.271 region:rollup2
DRIVEN FOCUS BETTER REALIZE

00:29:30.102 --> 00:29:33.939 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:29:32.271 --> 00:29:34.206 region:rollup2
THEIR SEGMENTS ARE BIG PIECE OF

00:29:33.939 --> 00:29:35.407 region:rollup2
THIS AND.

00:29:34.206 --> 00:29:36.475 region:rollup2
.

00:29:35.407 --> 00:29:38.644 region:rollup2
AND THAT WE WANT INTO YOUR

00:29:36.475 --> 00:29:40.279 region:rollup2
SEGMENTS ON HOW IT WOULD IMPACT

00:29:38.644 --> 00:29:42.614 region:rollup2
THE STUDENTS

00:29:40.279 --> 00:29:44.182 region:rollup2
WCC S. YOU AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:29:42.614 --> 00:29:45.951 region:rollup2
SYSTEM AND OF COURSE WE WOULD DO

00:29:44.182 --> 00:29:46.184 region:rollup2
WELL TO NOTE THERE ARE. STUDENTS

00:29:45.951 --> 00:29:47.486 region:rollup2
AT THE.

00:29:46.184 --> 00:29:49.187 region:rollup2
AT THE.

00:29:47.486 --> 00:29:51.456 region:rollup2
NONPROFIT PRIVATE COLLEGES AND

00:29:49.187 --> 00:29:53.492 region:rollup2
FOR PROFIT TO DO I REPRESENT CAL

00:29:51.456 --> 00:29:54.226 region:rollup2
GRANT RECIPIENTS BUT WE WANT TO

00:29:53.492 --> 00:29:57.729 region:rollup2
JUST FOCUS ON THE.

00:29:54.226 --> 00:29:59.731 region:rollup2
BUT THAT THE MAIN THREE TODAY.

00:29:57.729 --> 00:30:02.034 region:rollup2
SO WHO WANTS TO GO FIRST.

00:29:59.731 --> 00:30:03.168 region:rollup2
SURE.

00:30:02.034 --> 00:30:04.936 region:rollup2
GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CHRIS

00:30:03.168 --> 00:30:05.937 region:rollup2
CARTER AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF

00:30:04.936 --> 00:30:07.339 region:rollup2
STUDENT FINANCIAL SUPPORT AT THE

00:30:05.937 --> 00:30:08.373 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND I.

00:30:07.339 --> 00:30:09.708 region:rollup2
THINK YOU CHAIR MCCARTY AND

00:30:08.373 --> 00:30:10.642 region:rollup2
MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:30:09.708 --> 00:30:11.710 region:rollup2
SPEAK TODAY.

00:30:10.642 --> 00:30:12.911 region:rollup2
I WORK WITH MY CAMPUS

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:14.546 region:rollup2
FINANCIALLY COLLEAGUES TO MAKE

00:30:12.911 --> 00:30:16.314 region:rollup2
YOU SEE AFFORDABLE ACCESSIBLE TO

00:30:14.546 --> 00:30:17.349 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA STUDENTS.

00:30:16.314 --> 00:30:18.984 region:rollup2
BUT I'D LIKE TO BEGIN WITH A

00:30:17.349 --> 00:30:19.985 region:rollup2
BRIEF EXPLANATION OF UC'S

00:30:18.984 --> 00:30:22.054 region:rollup2
APPROACHED UNDERGRADUATE

00:30:19.985 --> 00:30:23.021 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AID WHICH WE CALL THE

00:30:22.054 --> 00:30:24.189 region:rollup2
EDUCATION FINANCING MODEL.

00:30:23.021 --> 00:30:25.590 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE REPORT THAT THE

00:30:24.189 --> 00:30:26.825 region:rollup2
STUDENT A COMMISSION.

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:28.260 region:rollup2
FOR TWO STERN A COMMISSION THAT

00:30:26.825 --> 00:30:29.494 region:rollup2
YOU'RE DISCUSSING TODAY

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:30.395 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY SUGGESTS

00:30:29.494 --> 00:30:32.064 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTING A PROGRAM THAT IN

00:30:30.395 --> 00:30:35.600 region:rollup2
MANY RESPECTS IS VERY SIMILAR TO

00:30:32.064 --> 00:30:36.568 region:rollup2
UC'S BUT I STATEWIDE BASIS SO.

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.203 region:rollup2
DESCRIBING OUR PROGRAM I HOPE

00:30:36.568 --> 00:30:39.871 region:rollup2
THAT MAKE YOU SEIZE PERSPECTIVE

00:30:38.203 --> 00:30:40.939 region:rollup2
ON THE REPORT CLEAR.

00:30:39.871 --> 00:30:42.341 region:rollup2
SO THE FINANCING MODEL THAT YOU

00:30:40.939 --> 00:30:43.875 region:rollup2
SEE IS REALLY CROWDED IN FOUR

00:30:42.341 --> 00:30:45.377 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTPRINCIPLES FIRST

00:30:43.875 --> 00:30:46.378 region:rollup2
REFRAIN FINANCIAL AID IN TERMS

00:30:45.377 --> 00:30:48.380 region:rollup2
OF ASSISTING STUDENTS AND THEIR

00:30:46.378 --> 00:30:49.915 region:rollup2
FAMILIES TO COVER. A TOTAL COST

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:51.450 region:rollup2
OF ATTENDANCE AND NOT JUST

00:30:49.915 --> 00:30:53.218 region:rollup2
TUITION EXPENSES THE INABILITY

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:54.586 region:rollup2
TO COVER COSTS ASSOCIATED

00:30:53.218 --> 00:30:56.154 region:rollup2
HOUSING FOOD OF BOOKS CAN BE

00:30:54.586 --> 00:30:57.756 region:rollup2
JUST AS MUCH A BARRIER. TO

00:30:56.154 --> 00:30:59.925 region:rollup2
STUDENTS AS AN INABILITY TO

00:30:57.756 --> 00:31:01.493 region:rollup2
COVER TUITION EXPENSES BUS JUST

00:30:59.925 --> 00:31:02.627 region:rollup2
MUCH DUST MOST UC FINANCIAL AID

00:31:01.493 --> 00:31:04.429 region:rollup2
RECIPIENTS RECEIVED GRANT

00:31:02.627 --> 00:31:07.199 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE BUT NOT ONLY OFFSETS

00:31:04.429 --> 00:31:08.633 region:rollup2
TUITION COSTS BUT ALSO HELPED

00:31:07.199 --> 00:31:09.568 region:rollup2
WITH OTHER EXPENSES.

00:31:08.633 --> 00:31:11.002 region:rollup2
SECOND RESPONSIBILITY FOR

00:31:09.568 --> 00:31:12.704 region:rollup2
COVERING COLLEGE COST CENTERS ON

00:31:11.002 --> 00:31:13.939 region:rollup2
THE PARTNERSHIP NET PARTNERSHIP

00:31:12.704 --> 00:31:15.073 region:rollup2
INCLUDES PARENTS TO THE EXTENT

00:31:13.939 --> 00:31:16.641 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE ABLE ACCORDING TO A

00:31:15.073 --> 00:31:18.777 region:rollup2
FEDERAL FORMULA.

00:31:16.641 --> 00:31:20.779 region:rollup2
STUDENTS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:31:18.777 --> 00:31:22.147 region:rollup2
THE STATE AND THE UNIVERSITY.

00:31:20.779 --> 00:31:23.115 region:rollup2
THIRD WE EXPECT ALL STUDENTS TO

00:31:22.147 --> 00:31:24.750 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTE TO THE AIR

00:31:23.115 --> 00:31:25.717 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL COSTS BUT THAT

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:27.252 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTION SHOULD BE A

00:31:25.717 --> 00:31:28.954 region:rollup2
MANAGEABLE ONE.

00:31:27.252 --> 00:31:30.155 region:rollup2
THUS THE NEED TO WORK AND BORROW

00:31:28.954 --> 00:31:31.256 region:rollup2
IS CERTAINLY THERE BUT IT NEEDS

00:31:30.155 --> 00:31:33.959 region:rollup2
TO BE REASONABLE AND GENERALLY

00:31:31.256 --> 00:31:34.659 region:rollup2
SIMILAR ACROSS UC CAMPUSES. AND

00:31:33.959 --> 00:31:36.495 region:rollup2
ACROSS STUDENT LIVING

00:31:34.659 --> 00:31:38.163 region:rollup2
ARRANGEMENTS.

00:31:36.495 --> 00:31:40.265 region:rollup2
FINALLY SINCE ANY SYSTEM MY

00:31:38.163 --> 00:31:42.134 region:rollup2
PROGRAM CANNOT ADDRESS ALL LOCAL

00:31:40.265 --> 00:31:43.268 region:rollup2
AND STUDENT SPECIFIC NEEDS.

00:31:42.134 --> 00:31:44.970 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES NEED TO HAVE ADEQUATE

00:31:43.268 --> 00:31:46.505 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY LOCALLY TO ADDRESS

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:47.873 region:rollup2
LOCAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND

00:31:46.505 --> 00:31:49.875 region:rollup2
SPECIALIZED NEEDS THAT SOME

00:31:47.873 --> 00:31:51.409 region:rollup2
STUDENTS HAVE.

00:31:49.875 --> 00:31:53.011 region:rollup2
SO NOW WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS

00:31:51.409 --> 00:31:54.413 region:rollup2
TURN TO THE HANDOUT THAT I THINK

00:31:53.011 --> 00:31:55.781 region:rollup2
I SEE YOU JUST RECEIVED. AND

00:31:54.413 --> 00:31:57.082 region:rollup2
LIKE TO START WITH FIGURE ONE OF

00:31:55.781 --> 00:31:58.550 region:rollup2
THE HAND OUT TO SHOW THE E. FM

00:31:57.082 --> 00:31:59.985 region:rollup2
IN PRACTICE.

00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:01.987 region:rollup2
SO FIGURE WISELY VISUALIZATION

00:31:59.985 --> 00:32:03.588 region:rollup2
OF HOW PARENTS STUDENTS AND

00:32:01.987 --> 00:32:04.923 region:rollup2
FINANCIALLY WORK TOGETHER. AND

00:32:03.588 --> 00:32:06.825 region:rollup2
ALL THIS DOES NOT CAPTURE EVERY

00:32:04.923 --> 00:32:08.226 region:rollup2
STUDENTS CIRCUMSTANCES AS THE

00:32:06.825 --> 00:32:09.694 region:rollup2
REPORT. THEY ARE CONSIDERING

00:32:08.226 --> 00:32:11.029 region:rollup2
TODAY SAYS NOT ALL STUDENTS FROM

00:32:09.694 --> 00:32:12.130 region:rollup2
LOW INCOME FAMILIES RECEIVE A

00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:13.198 region:rollup2
CAL GRANT.

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:14.699 region:rollup2
IT DOES BROAD THE REFLECT HOW

00:32:13.198 --> 00:32:16.902 region:rollup2
YOU SEE HELPS UNDERGRADUATES

00:32:14.699 --> 00:32:17.736 region:rollup2
FINANCING THEIR EDUCATION.

00:32:16.902 --> 00:32:19.004 region:rollup2
SO HOW DO THE TAR REALLY

00:32:17.736 --> 00:32:20.272 region:rollup2
REFLECTS THE TOTAL COST OF

00:32:19.004 --> 00:32:21.573 region:rollup2
ATTENDANCE FOR AN AVERAGE

00:32:20.272 --> 00:32:22.574 region:rollup2
STUDENT LIVING ON CAMPUS OF A

00:32:21.573 --> 00:32:24.443 region:rollup2
STUDENT'S FINANCIAL AID

00:32:22.574 --> 00:32:26.111 region:rollup2
ELIGIBILITY IS CALCULATED. WITH

00:32:24.443 --> 00:32:27.712 region:rollup2
COST UNIQUE TO THEIR CAMPUS AND

00:32:26.111 --> 00:32:28.380 region:rollup2
LIVING SITUATION.

00:32:27.712 --> 00:32:29.781 region:rollup2
AND MOVING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:31.283 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF THESE COSTS ARE

00:32:29.781 --> 00:32:32.517 region:rollup2
MANAGED BY STUDENTS AND FAMILIES

00:32:31.283 --> 00:32:34.119 region:rollup2
WITH INCREASING PARENT INCOME

00:32:32.517 --> 00:32:35.687 region:rollup2
LEVELS.

00:32:34.119 --> 00:32:36.721 region:rollup2
WHILE WE LOOK. AT MORE THAN

00:32:35.687 --> 00:32:38.690 region:rollup2
PARENT INCOME IN DETERMINING

00:32:36.721 --> 00:32:39.925 region:rollup2
WHAT PARENTS CAN CONTRIBUTE IN

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:40.959 region:rollup2
THIS CASE THE INCOME USED AS A

00:32:39.925 --> 00:32:43.528 region:rollup2
STRONG PROXY FOR FAMILY

00:32:40.959 --> 00:32:45.063 region:rollup2
RESOURCES.

00:32:43.528 --> 00:32:45.997 region:rollup2
SO NOT FIRST THE EXPECTATION

00:32:45.063 --> 00:32:47.399 region:rollup2
THAT ALL STUDENTS CONTRIBUTE

00:32:45.997 --> 00:32:49.434 region:rollup2
WITH SOME COMBINATION OF WORK

00:32:47.399 --> 00:32:51.069 region:rollup2
AND BORROWING SHOWN IN. IN GREEN

00:32:49.434 --> 00:32:52.938 region:rollup2
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CHART.

00:32:51.069 --> 00:32:53.872 region:rollup2
WE ASSUME THAT ALL STUDENTS

00:32:52.938 --> 00:32:55.740 region:rollup2
WHICHEVER CAMPUS WHICHEVER

00:32:53.872 --> 00:32:57.375 region:rollup2
LIVING SITUATION WILL CONTRIBUTE

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:59.110 region:rollup2
TO THE COST OF ATTENDANCE WITH A

00:32:57.375 --> 00:33:00.245 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR AND

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:02.247 region:rollup2
MANAGEABLE LEVEL OF WORK AND

00:33:00.245 --> 00:33:03.281 region:rollup2
BORROWING.

00:33:02.247 --> 00:33:04.850 region:rollup2
THE CONTRIBUTION FROM PARENTS

00:33:03.281 --> 00:33:06.852 region:rollup2
SHOWING GRAY IN THE UPPER RIGHT

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:07.619 region:rollup2
HAND SIDE OF THE CHART. IS

00:33:06.852 --> 00:33:09.387 region:rollup2
CALCULATED ACCORDING TO A

00:33:07.619 --> 00:33:10.689 region:rollup2
FEDERAL FORMULA AND GROWS AS

00:33:09.387 --> 00:33:11.723 region:rollup2
FAMILY RESOURCES GROW.

00:33:10.689 --> 00:33:13.391 region:rollup2
AND THEN YOU CAN SEE IN DARK

00:33:11.723 --> 00:33:15.260 region:rollup2
BLUE WE HAVE THE PELL GRANTS AND

00:33:13.391 --> 00:33:16.461 region:rollup2
THEN WE ALSO HAVE BEEN IN GOLD

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:18.163 region:rollup2
THE CAL GRANTS WHICH OF THE

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

00:33:18.663 --> 00:33:22.234 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

00:33:20.732 --> 00:33:24.102 region:rollup2
WE THEN FILL IN THE REMAINING

00:33:22.234 --> 00:33:26.004 region:rollup2

00:33:24.102 --> 00:33:27.606 region:rollup2
WITH YOU SEE GRANT ASSISTANCE.

00:33:26.004 --> 00:33:29.241 region:rollup2
IF A STUDENT IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR

00:33:27.606 --> 00:33:30.876 region:rollup2
A PELL GRANT BECAUSE HERE SHE

00:33:29.241 --> 00:33:32.244 region:rollup2

PUBLIC BECOMES A PART OF THAT

00:33:35.046 --> 00:33:37.482 region:rollup2
GAP

00:33:36.081 --> 00:33:39.150 region:rollup2
THAT WE FILL IN WITH YOU SEE

00:33:37.482 --> 00:33:40.986 region:rollup2

ACROSS STUDENTS.

00:33:43.889 --> 00:33:46.324 region:rollup2
THE HIGHER THE TOTAL GRANT

00:33:44.656 --> 00:33:48.026 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE ACCOUNTING FOR GRANTS

00:33:46.324 --> 00:33:49.995 region:rollup2
FROM ALL THREE SOURCES.

00:33:48.026 --> 00:33:52.130 region:rollup2
THE LOWER THE NEED FOR ALL GRANT

00:33:49.995 --> 00:33:53.765 region:rollup2
RECIPIENTS AT UC TO WORK AND TO

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:55.267 region:rollup2

00:33:53.765 --> 00:33:56.835 region:rollup2
IF GRANT ASSISTANCE FALSE OR OF

00:33:55.267 --> 00:33:58.904 region:rollup2
COSTS INCREASE IN GRANT

00:33:56.835 --> 00:33:59.804 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE DOES NOT KEEP PACE.

00:33:58.904 --> 00:34:01.573 region:rollup2
THEN THE NEED TO WORK AND BORROW

00:33:59.804 --> 00:34:02.741 region:rollup2
GOES UP.

00:34:01.573 --> 00:34:04.242 region:rollup2
PERCENT TAKES US TO FIGURE TWO

00:34:02.741 --> 00:34:05.243 region:rollup2
WHICH SHOWS WHAT COULD HAPPEN IF

00:34:04.242 --> 00:34:06.912 region:rollup2
ALL OTHER COMPONENTS OF THE

00:34:05.243 --> 00:34:08.179 region:rollup2
CHART WERE HELD CONSTANT. AND

00:34:06.912 --> 00:34:10.081 region:rollup2
CAL GRANT CAL GRANT FUNDING FOR

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:12.617 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE RECEIVED BY YOU SEE

00:34:10.081 --> 00:34:13.785 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WAS WOULD DECLINE.

00:34:12.617 --> 00:34:15.020 region:rollup2
THIS IS EFFECTIVELY A GRAPHICAL

00:34:13.785 --> 00:34:16.488 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATION OF THE SCENARIO

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:18.390 region:rollup2
REFERENCED IN PAGE EIGHT OF YOUR

00:34:16.488 --> 00:34:20.258 region:rollup2
AGENDA. AND WITH LESS TOTAL

00:34:18.390 --> 00:34:22.394 region:rollup2
GRANT ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE THE

00:34:20.258 --> 00:34:23.595 region:rollup2
NEED TO WORK AND BORROW WOULD GO

00:34:22.394 --> 00:34:26.731 region:rollup2
UP FOR ALL GRANT RECIPIENTS AT

00:34:23.595 --> 00:34:27.766 region:rollup2
UC.

00:34:26.731 --> 00:34:28.800 region:rollup2
SO PRESENTED THE SCENARIO

00:34:27.766 --> 00:34:29.935 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.603 region:rollup2
THE FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF

00:34:29.935 --> 00:34:32.137 region:rollup2
THE REPORT FOR YOU SEE STUDENTS

00:34:31.603 --> 00:34:33.672 region:rollup2
ARE AT LEAST TWO DIFFERENT

00:34:32.137 --> 00:34:35.273 region:rollup2
RESPECTS.

00:34:33.672 --> 00:34:36.141 region:rollup2
FIRST THE REPORT DOES SUGGEST

00:34:35.273 --> 00:34:38.143 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTING CAO GRANTS TO

00:34:36.141 --> 00:34:40.011 region:rollup2
STUDENTS TO SET AND NEED TO WORK

00:34:38.143 --> 00:34:41.246 region:rollup2
CAN BORROW. WORK TURNED IN

00:34:40.011 --> 00:34:43.248 region:rollup2
AFFORDABILITY TARGET IN THE

00:34:41.246 --> 00:34:44.716 region:rollup2
REPORT ITSELF AT ABOUT ELEVEN

00:34:43.248 --> 00:34:46.217 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:34:44.716 --> 00:34:47.886 region:rollup2
AND CORRECTLY THE REPORT

00:34:46.217 --> 00:34:49.387 region:rollup2
REFERENCES THIS AS ONE OF THE

00:34:47.886 --> 00:34:50.956 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY CALCULATES IS BEING

00:34:49.387 --> 00:34:52.357 region:rollup2
AND MANAGEABLE RANGE.

00:34:50.956 --> 00:34:54.059 region:rollup2
BUT HOW TOUGH TO POINT OUT THAT

00:34:52.357 --> 00:34:55.927 region:rollup2
IS STILL HIGHER THAN THE LEVEL

00:34:54.059 --> 00:34:57.329 region:rollup2
THE UC STUDENTS CURRENT FACE

00:34:55.927 --> 00:34:58.129 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY FACE AND THAT'S THE

00:34:57.329 --> 00:34:59.497 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE TO

00:34:58.129 --> 00:35:00.532 region:rollup2
ROUGHLY ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR

00:34:59.497 --> 00:35:01.533 region:rollup2
INCREASE.

00:35:00.532 --> 00:35:03.134 region:rollup2
AND THE NEED FOR YOU SEE

00:35:01.533 --> 00:35:05.203 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AID RECIPIENTS TO WORK

00:35:03.134 --> 00:35:06.504 region:rollup2
AND BORROW ANNUALLY.

00:35:05.203 --> 00:35:08.373 region:rollup2
AND SECONDLY WERE CONCERNED THAT

00:35:06.504 --> 00:35:09.874 region:rollup2
WHILE THE REFORM OUTCOME OF A

00:35:08.373 --> 00:35:11.576 region:rollup2
COMMON AFFORDABILITY TARGET

00:35:09.874 --> 00:35:13.478 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE PUBLIC SEGMENTS A

00:35:11.576 --> 00:35:14.112 region:rollup2
SPECIFIED IN THE REPORT.

00:35:13.478 --> 00:35:15.780 region:rollup2
THE PATH TO THAT OUTCOME IS NOT

00:35:14.112 --> 00:35:17.048 region:rollup2
CLEAR.

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:18.650 region:rollup2
AS DESCRIBED IN YOUR AGENDA FACE

00:35:17.048 --> 00:35:20.018 region:rollup2
PROCESS FOR ACHIEVING THAT GOAL

00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:21.786 region:rollup2
DURING WHICH THE OUTCOME IS ONLY

00:35:20.018 --> 00:35:22.988 region:rollup2
PARTIALLY FUNDED. COULD RESULT

00:35:21.786 --> 00:35:24.422 region:rollup2
IN YOU SEE STUDENTS RECEIVING

00:35:22.988 --> 00:35:26.624 region:rollup2
LESS CAL GRANT SYSTEMS AND BY

00:35:24.422 --> 00:35:28.593 region:rollup2
EXTENSION. INCREASES IN THE NEED

00:35:26.624 --> 00:35:30.095 region:rollup2
FOR STUDENTS TO WORK AND TO

00:35:28.593 --> 00:35:31.396 region:rollup2
BORROW.

00:35:30.095 --> 00:35:33.231 region:rollup2
NOW WE CONSIDER THESE CONCERNS

00:35:31.396 --> 00:35:34.833 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT PRECISELY BECAUSE THE

00:35:33.231 --> 00:35:36.334 region:rollup2
STATE SUPPORT FOR THE CAL GRANT

00:35:34.833 --> 00:35:38.136 region:rollup2

IMPORTANT FOR YOU SEE STUDENTS.

00:35:38.136 --> 00:35:41.172 region:rollup2
WHO LOOK TO SOME COMBINATION OF

WRAPPING UP SHARE TO ADDITIONAL

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:51.483 region:rollup2
CONCERNS.

00:35:49.681 --> 00:35:52.717 region:rollup2
FIRST THE ROLE OF THE CAMPUS

00:35:51.483 --> 00:35:53.718 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AID PROFESSIONALS IS

00:35:52.717 --> 00:35:55.720 region:rollup2

LOCALLY.

00:36:29.454 --> 00:36:31.689 region:rollup2
AND SO THE ABILITY TO USE THAT

00:36:30.822 --> 00:36:33.625 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONAL FINDING IS

00:36:31.689 --> 00:36:34.893 region:rollup2
CRITICAL TO ADDRESSING THOSE

00:36:33.625 --> 00:36:37.395 region:rollup2

CAN IDENTIFY.

00:36:40.231 --> 00:36:42.600 region:rollup2
FURTHER TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

00:36:41.266 --> 00:36:43.768 region:rollup2
STATE IS ABLE TO INCREASE ITS

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:45.437 region:rollup2

REVIEW OF CALIFORNIA'S FINANCIAL

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:25.203 region:rollup2

00:38:23.668 --> 00:38:26.805 region:rollup2
WE APPRECIATE THAT YOU ARE

00:38:25.203 --> 00:38:28.406 region:rollup2
TACKLING THIS CRITICAL ISSUE

00:38:26.805 --> 00:38:30.675 region:rollup2
WITH CAREFUL CONSIDERATION AND

00:38:28.406 --> 00:38:31.776 region:rollup2
THOROUGH COLLABORATION.

00:38:30.675 --> 00:38:33.344 region:rollup2
AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE

00:38:31.776 --> 00:38:34.846 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY WE SUPPORT THE

00:38:33.344 --> 00:38:36.214 region:rollup2
CENTURY FOUNDATION REPORTS CORE

00:38:34.846 --> 00:38:37.549 region:rollup2
PRINCIPLE.

00:38:36.214 --> 00:38:39.250 region:rollup2
THAT FINANCIAL AID SHOULD BE

00:38:37.549 --> 00:38:41.319 region:rollup2
EASY AND CONVENIENT FOR STUDENTS

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:42.587 region:rollup2
AND FAMILY. AND THAT FINANCIAL

00:38:41.319 --> 00:38:44.556 region:rollup2
AID TO BETTER SERVE STUDENTS

00:38:42.587 --> 00:38:45.790 region:rollup2
WITH FINANCIAL NEED.

00:38:44.556 --> 00:38:46.925 region:rollup2
INDEED THE CHANGES TO

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:48.359 region:rollup2
ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS

00:38:46.925 --> 00:38:49.928 region:rollup2
PROPOSED IN THE REPORT WOULD

00:38:48.359 --> 00:38:51.429 region:rollup2
SIMPLIFY THE PROCESS FOR

00:38:49.928 --> 00:38:52.897 region:rollup2
STUDENTS AND FAMILIES.

00:38:51.429 --> 00:38:54.232 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS MERGING THE VARIOUS

00:38:52.897 --> 00:38:55.333 region:rollup2
CAL GRANT PROGRAMS IN THE MIDDLE

00:38:56.968 --> 00:39:00.905 region:rollup2
REMOVING THE GPA AND EIGHT

REQUIREMENTS USING ESTIMATED

00:39:00.905 --> 00:39:04.442 region:rollup2
FAMILY CONTRIBUTION INSTEAD OF

00:39:02.574 --> 00:39:06.177 region:rollup2
INCOME OR ASSETS HEALINGS. AND

00:39:04.442 --> 00:39:08.112 region:rollup2
ELIMINATING THE DISTINCTION

00:39:06.177 --> 00:39:09.714 region:rollup2
BETWEEN ENTITLEMENT AWARDS.

00:39:08.112 --> 00:39:11.115 region:rollup2
THOSE AWARDED STRAIGHT OUT OF

00:39:09.714 --> 00:39:12.750 region:rollup2
HIGH SCHOOL AND COMPETITIVE WAR

00:39:11.115 --> 00:39:14.018 region:rollup2
AWARDS. ALTHOUGH HOW OF THE

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:15.587 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL TO MAKE THE SYSTEM

00:39:14.018 --> 00:39:17.088 region:rollup2
FAIR AND LESS DAUNTING FOR

00:39:15.587 --> 00:39:18.623 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

00:39:17.088 --> 00:39:19.924 region:rollup2
SIMPLIFYING THE PROGRAMS AND THE

00:39:18.623 --> 00:39:22.193 region:rollup2
APPLICATION PROCESS WOULD BE

00:39:19.924 --> 00:39:23.795 region:rollup2
MOST BENEFICIAL.

00:39:22.193 --> 00:39:25.563 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THIS POSITIVE STUDENT

00:39:23.795 --> 00:39:27.465 region:rollup2
IMPACT THE CSU SUPPORTIVE OF

00:39:25.563 --> 00:39:29.067 region:rollup2
THESE PROPOSALS.

00:39:27.465 --> 00:39:31.336 region:rollup2
WE ALSO STRONGLY SUPPORT THE

00:39:29.067 --> 00:39:33.238 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION TO EXPAND THE COG

00:39:31.336 --> 00:39:35.373 region:rollup2
ROUTE TO MEET STUDENT NEEDS.

00:39:33.238 --> 00:39:36.975 region:rollup2
BOTH THROUGH FEW MORE WARDS TO

00:39:35.373 --> 00:39:38.409 region:rollup2
STUDENTS INCLUDING TRANSFER

00:39:36.975 --> 00:39:40.011 region:rollup2
STUDENTS AND THROUGH POTENTIALLY

00:39:38.409 --> 00:39:41.512 region:rollup2
LARGER AWARDS.

00:39:40.011 --> 00:39:42.680 region:rollup2
THAT SUPPORT PRESUMES THAT THERE

00:39:41.512 --> 00:39:44.148 region:rollup2
WOULD BE SUFFICIENT STATE

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:45.550 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TO SUPPORT BOTH AN

00:39:44.148 --> 00:39:47.585 region:rollup2
EXPANSION OF THE COG ROUND

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:49.354 region:rollup2
PROGRAM. AS WELL AS NEW

00:39:47.585 --> 00:39:51.055 region:rollup2
INCREMENTAL INVESTMENT IN THE CS

00:39:49.354 --> 00:39:52.690 region:rollup2
YOU SO THAT WE COULD PROVIDE THE

00:39:51.055 --> 00:39:54.425 region:rollup2
ACADEMIC PROGRAMS AND SERVICES

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:55.793 region:rollup2
TO STUDENTS.

00:39:54.425 --> 00:39:57.161 region:rollup2
IN KEEPING WITH THE SLANT OF

00:39:55.793 --> 00:39:59.430 region:rollup2
IMPACT TO STUDENTS AND FAMILIES

00:39:57.161 --> 00:40:00.732 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:03.234 region:rollup2
ABOUT POTENTIAL UNINTENDED

00:40:00.732 --> 00:40:04.869 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES. OF OTHER REPORT

00:40:03.234 --> 00:40:06.871 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:40:04.869 --> 00:40:07.905 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE IT IS CRITICALLY

00:40:06.871 --> 00:40:09.774 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THAT WHEN THE STUDENT

00:40:07.905 --> 00:40:11.576 region:rollup2
HAS QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS ABOUT

00:40:09.774 --> 00:40:12.910 region:rollup2
THEIR FINANCIAL AID THEY'RE ABLE

00:40:11.576 --> 00:40:14.746 region:rollup2
TO TALK TO SOMEONE ON THE

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:15.680 region:rollup2
COLLEGE CAMPUS TO GET ANSWERS

00:40:14.746 --> 00:40:17.248 region:rollup2
AND A RESOLUTION TO THEIR

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:18.616 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS.

00:40:17.248 --> 00:40:19.817 region:rollup2
REQUIRING THE STUDENTS TO

00:40:18.616 --> 00:40:21.386 region:rollup2
INSTEAD DISCUSS ISSUES WITH THE

00:40:19.817 --> 00:40:23.688 region:rollup2
STATE AGENCY OR ADDING AN

00:40:21.386 --> 00:40:25.423 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL LAYER OF BUREAUCRACY.

00:40:23.688 --> 00:40:27.125 region:rollup2
WILL INEVITABLY CONFUSE AND

00:40:25.423 --> 00:40:28.693 region:rollup2
DEFLATE STUDENTS WHO CANNOT

00:40:27.125 --> 00:40:30.128 region:rollup2
MANAGE THE SYSTEM AND THEREFORE

00:40:28.693 --> 00:40:31.496 region:rollup2
CANNOT GET THE INFORMATION THEY

00:40:30.128 --> 00:40:33.231 region:rollup2
NEED.

00:40:31.496 --> 00:40:34.532 region:rollup2
THIS IS PARTICULARLY CONCERNING

00:40:33.231 --> 00:40:35.466 region:rollup2
FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE THE FIRST

00:40:34.532 --> 00:40:37.435 region:rollup2
AND THEIR FAMILIES TO GO TO

00:40:35.466 --> 00:40:40.004 region:rollup2
COLLEGE WHICH IS ONE THIRD OF

00:40:37.435 --> 00:40:41.306 region:rollup2
THE CSU STUDENT POPULATION. AND

00:40:40.004 --> 00:40:43.541 region:rollup2
NOT MY PARTICULAR CAMPUS

00:40:41.306 --> 00:40:45.543 region:rollup2
STANISLAUS REPRESENTS A SEVENTY

00:40:43.541 --> 00:40:47.712 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF OUR STUDENTS.

00:40:45.543 --> 00:40:49.314 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY.

00:40:47.712 --> 00:40:51.282 region:rollup2
THE REPORT'S RECOMMENDATION OF

00:40:49.314 --> 00:40:53.518 region:rollup2
IMPOSING A STUDENT CONTRIBUTION

00:40:51.282 --> 00:40:55.520 region:rollup2
OF ELEVEN THOUSAND. DOLLARS

00:40:53.518 --> 00:40:57.922 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF THE STUDENTS TRUE

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:59.257 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC SITUATION. HAS THE

00:40:57.922 --> 00:41:00.925 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL TO HARM OUR MOST

00:40:59.257 --> 00:41:02.460 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE STUDENTS

00:41:00.925 --> 00:41:03.961 region:rollup2
STUDENTS THAT HAVE VERY LOW

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:06.364 region:rollup2
FAMILY INCOMES AND CHOOSE TO

00:41:03.961 --> 00:41:08.032 region:rollup2
LIVE AT HOME TO CUT COSTS.

00:41:06.364 --> 00:41:09.600 region:rollup2
OFTEN CSU STUDENTS WHO WORK

00:41:08.032 --> 00:41:10.902 region:rollup2
WHILE ATTENDING COLLEGE ARE

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:13.071 region:rollup2
USING THEIR INCOME TO HELP

00:41:10.902 --> 00:41:14.706 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES NOT JUST

00:41:13.071 --> 00:41:16.541 region:rollup2
PAY COLLEGE EXPENSES.

00:41:14.706 --> 00:41:17.709 region:rollup2
YET THIS WORK EXPECTATION TO

00:41:16.541 --> 00:41:19.510 region:rollup2
RECEIVE AID WOULD ESSENTIALLY

00:41:17.709 --> 00:41:21.145 region:rollup2
ELIMINATE THE STUDENTS

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:22.914 region:rollup2
ELIGIBILITY FOR CAUGHT GRANT.

00:41:21.145 --> 00:41:24.816 region:rollup2
INCREASING THE LIKELIHOOD OF

00:41:22.914 --> 00:41:25.917 region:rollup2
STUDENT BORROWING.

00:41:24.816 --> 00:41:27.752 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD ALSO HAVE A LARGE

00:41:25.917 --> 00:41:29.887 region:rollup2
IMPACT AND UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS

00:41:27.752 --> 00:41:32.023 region:rollup2
IS NOT ALL ARE TAKA AND

00:41:29.887 --> 00:41:33.725 region:rollup2
THEREFORE ARE UNABLE TO WORK.

00:41:32.023 --> 00:41:35.193 region:rollup2
THESE EXAMPLES HIGHLIGHT THE CS

00:41:33.725 --> 00:41:36.461 region:rollup2
USE PRIMARY CONCERN ABOUT

00:41:35.193 --> 00:41:38.363 region:rollup2
SEVERAL OF THE REPORT

00:41:36.461 --> 00:41:39.364 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS MAINLY THE

00:41:38.363 --> 00:41:41.432 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL FOR UNINTENDED

00:41:39.364 --> 00:41:43.034 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES THAT WOULD HINDER

00:41:41.432 --> 00:41:44.135 region:rollup2
THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE AND

00:41:43.034 --> 00:41:46.037 region:rollup2
NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR MOST

00:41:44.135 --> 00:41:46.871 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE STUDENTS.

00:41:46.037 --> 00:41:48.740 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO NEED THE MOST

00:41:46.871 --> 00:41:50.975 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL SUPPORT.

00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:52.677 region:rollup2
AS THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERS HOW

00:41:50.975 --> 00:41:54.245 region:rollup2
BEST TO SUPPORT STUDENTS AND A

00:41:52.677 --> 00:41:56.114 region:rollup2
DRESSER FULL FINANCIAL NEEDS IN

00:41:54.245 --> 00:41:57.615 region:rollup2
COLLEGE. I BELIEVE SUPPORTING

00:41:56.114 --> 00:41:58.783 region:rollup2
THE EFFORTS ALREADY UNDERWAY ON

00:41:57.615 --> 00:41:59.884 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES IS AN EFFECTIVE

00:41:58.783 --> 00:42:01.386 region:rollup2
APPROACH.

00:41:59.884 --> 00:42:02.987 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE THE REPORT

00:42:01.386 --> 00:42:04.489 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDS HIRING A TEAM AT C.

00:42:02.987 --> 00:42:05.857 region:rollup2
SACK TO RAMP UP OUTREACH TO

00:42:04.489 --> 00:42:07.392 region:rollup2
STUDENTS EARLIER IN THEIR

00:42:05.857 --> 00:42:09.127 region:rollup2
ACADEMIC EXPERIENCE.

00:42:07.392 --> 00:42:10.962 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THEY ARE AWARE OF

00:42:09.127 --> 00:42:12.830 region:rollup2
FINANCIALLY OPPORTUNITIES.

00:42:10.962 --> 00:42:14.332 region:rollup2
WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS TYPE OF

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:16.401 region:rollup2
OUTREACH AND ARE ENGAGED IN IT

00:42:14.332 --> 00:42:17.835 region:rollup2
BOTH AS A SYSTEM THEM AS

00:42:16.401 --> 00:42:19.670 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES.

00:42:17.835 --> 00:42:21.172 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE AT STANISLAUS WE

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:22.507 region:rollup2
HAVE EARLY OUTREACH EFFORTS IN

00:42:21.172 --> 00:42:23.941 region:rollup2
BOTH OUR FINANCIAL AID OFFICE

00:42:22.507 --> 00:42:26.310 region:rollup2
AND OUR ADMISSIONS AND OUTREACH

00:42:23.941 --> 00:42:27.979 region:rollup2
OFFICES. WE HOLD MANY WORKSHOPS

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:29.547 region:rollup2
FOR PARENTS AND STUDENTS IN

00:42:27.979 --> 00:42:31.115 region:rollup2
GRADES SIX THROUGH EIGHT SO THAT

00:42:29.547 --> 00:42:33.117 region:rollup2
THEY ARE AWARE OF ADMISSIONS

00:42:31.115 --> 00:42:34.585 region:rollup2
CRITERIA AND THE AVAILABILITY OF

00:42:33.117 --> 00:42:36.187 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AID.

00:42:34.585 --> 00:42:37.188 region:rollup2
WE WORK CLOSELY WITH P. CAME THE

00:42:36.187 --> 00:42:38.623 region:rollup2
PARENT INSTITUTE FOR QUALITY

00:42:37.188 --> 00:42:40.324 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

00:42:38.623 --> 00:42:41.626 region:rollup2
AS WE THINK PARENTS

00:42:40.324 --> 00:42:43.861 region:rollup2
ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE

00:42:41.626 --> 00:42:44.962 region:rollup2
EQUATION AND ARE OFTEN THE FIRST

00:42:43.861 --> 00:42:46.364 region:rollup2
TO ENCOURAGE OUR CHILDREN TO

00:42:44.962 --> 00:42:47.832 region:rollup2
ATTEND COLLEGE.

00:42:46.364 --> 00:42:48.766 region:rollup2
PERRANCE BELIEVE IT IS POSSIBLE

00:42:47.832 --> 00:42:50.001 region:rollup2
THAT BELIEF WILL TRANSFER TO

00:42:48.766 --> 00:42:52.403 region:rollup2
THEIR STUDENTS.

00:42:50.001 --> 00:42:54.138 region:rollup2
AND THEIR CHILDREN.

00:42:52.403 --> 00:42:56.107 region:rollup2
I AM A PERFECT WORLD ONE WERE

00:42:54.138 --> 00:42:58.075 region:rollup2
FUNDS ARE LIMITLESS AND HIGHER

00:42:56.107 --> 00:42:59.143 region:rollup2
EDUCATION WITH FULLY FUNDED. I

00:42:58.075 --> 00:43:00.611 region:rollup2
WOULD SAY THAT INCREASING

00:42:59.143 --> 00:43:03.314 region:rollup2
OUTREACH AT THE STATE LEVEL WAS

00:43:00.611 --> 00:43:05.616 region:rollup2
A GREAT IDEA. THE MORE VOICES

00:43:03.314 --> 00:43:07.652 region:rollup2
THE BETTER HOWEVER THE REALITY

00:43:05.616 --> 00:43:08.920 region:rollup2
IS THAT FUNDING IS FINITE AND

00:43:07.652 --> 00:43:10.788 region:rollup2
THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH HIGHER

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:12.090 region:rollup2
EDUCATION DOLLARS TO MEET ALL OF

00:43:10.788 --> 00:43:13.758 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S NEEDS.

00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:15.593 region:rollup2
AS SUCH I WOULD QUESTION WHETHER

00:43:13.758 --> 00:43:16.994 region:rollup2
DUPLICATING THESE EFFORTS IS IN

00:43:15.593 --> 00:43:19.063 region:rollup2
THE BEST INTEREST OF THE STATE

00:43:16.994 --> 00:43:20.832 region:rollup2
AND ITS STUDENTS.

00:43:19.063 --> 00:43:22.233 region:rollup2
ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THE CSU BASIC

00:43:20.832 --> 00:43:23.734 region:rollup2
NEEDS INITIATIVE AIMED AT

00:43:22.233 --> 00:43:26.070 region:rollup2
SUPPORTING STUDENTS WHO FACE

00:43:23.734 --> 00:43:27.371 region:rollup2
FOOD AND HOUSING AND SECURITY.

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:29.507 region:rollup2
AS PART OF THIS INITIATIVE ALL

00:43:27.371 --> 00:43:31.375 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES OFFER FOOD DISTRIBUTION

00:43:29.507 --> 00:43:33.377 region:rollup2
PROGRAMSAND THE NUMBER OF CSU

00:43:31.375 --> 00:43:35.680 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES OFFER MICROGRAPHS

00:43:33.377 --> 00:43:36.981 region:rollup2
SMALL FINANCIALLY TOWARDS. TO

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:38.916 region:rollup2
SUPPORT STUDENTS WHO FIND

00:43:36.981 --> 00:43:41.152 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES IN AN EMERGENCY OR

00:43:38.916 --> 00:43:42.487 region:rollup2
WHO ARE IN DIRE FINANCIAL NEED.

00:43:41.152 --> 00:43:44.722 region:rollup2
THE BASIC NEEDS INITIATIVE IS AN

00:43:42.487 --> 00:43:46.524 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE OF A PROGRAM AT THE CSU

00:43:44.722 --> 00:43:48.159 region:rollup2
THAT IS HELPING ADDRESS STUDENTS

00:43:46.524 --> 00:43:49.660 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL SITUATION.

00:43:48.159 --> 00:43:51.028 region:rollup2

00:44:57.261 --> 00:45:00.131 region:rollup2
YOUR AGENDA AND THE PREVIOUS

STUDENTS USING A DEFINITION OF

FINANCIAL NEED THAT IS BROADER

00:45:16.681 --> 00:45:19.216 region:rollup2
THAN THAT USED FOR OTHER

00:45:17.748 --> 00:45:20.351 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS INCLUDING

00:45:19.216 --> 00:45:22.019 region:rollup2
THE PELL GRANT.

00:45:20.351 --> 00:45:23.154 region:rollup2

AB NINETEEN APPROVED LAST YEAR

00:45:27.558 --> 00:45:30.928 region:rollup2
COULD INCREASE THESE TOTALS.

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:32.196 region:rollup2
HOWEVER IS YOUR AGENDA NOTES IN

00:45:30.928 --> 00:45:33.798 region:rollup2
HIS PREVIOUS SPEAKERS HAVE

00:45:32.196 --> 00:45:34.398 region:rollup2
MENTIONED FEW OF OUR STUDENTS

00:45:36.067 --> 00:45:38.903 region:rollup2
AND A PREVIOUS HEARINGS I'VE

00:45:37.134 --> 00:45:40.371 region:rollup2
MENTIONED THE VISION FOR SUCCESS

ADOPTED BLASTER PRIOR BOARD

00:45:40.371 --> 00:45:43.207 region:rollup2
WHICH CALLS THIS OUT AS A CAUSE

00:45:41.505 --> 00:45:44.208 region:rollup2
FOR CONCERN.

00:45:43.207 --> 00:45:45.343 region:rollup2
FOR THAT REASON WE AGREE WITH

00:45:44.208 --> 00:45:46.911 region:rollup2
THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE

00:45:45.343 --> 00:45:49.013 region:rollup2
INTENT TO MOVE AWAY FROM TUITION

00:45:46.911 --> 00:45:51.349 region:rollup2
COSTS AS THE PRIMARY BASIS FOR

00:45:49.013 --> 00:45:52.817 region:rollup2
AWARDING STATE FINANCIAL AID.

00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:54.018 region:rollup2
WE ALSO AGREE WITH THE EMPHASIS

00:45:52.817 --> 00:45:55.419 region:rollup2
ON CHANGES TO THE CAL GRANT

00:45:54.018 --> 00:45:57.021 region:rollup2
ELIGIBILITY RULES

00:45:55.419 --> 00:45:58.856 region:rollup2
AS DISCUSSED THE CURRENT RULES

00:45:57.021 --> 00:46:00.057 region:rollup2
LIMIT ENTITLEMENT ELIGIBILITY TO

00:45:58.856 --> 00:46:01.359 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WHO ENTER COLLEGE

00:46:00.057 --> 00:46:02.593 region:rollup2
WITHIN ONE YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL

00:46:01.359 --> 00:46:03.628 region:rollup2
GRADUATION.

00:46:02.593 --> 00:46:04.762 region:rollup2
THAT'S HOW WE TRADITIONALLY

00:46:03.628 --> 00:46:06.297 region:rollup2
THOUGHT OF COLLEGE AGE

00:46:04.762 --> 00:46:07.565 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS BUT IT CERTAINLY

00:46:06.297 --> 00:46:09.100 region:rollup2
DOESN'T REFLECT THE TYPICAL

00:46:07.565 --> 00:46:10.301 region:rollup2
STUDENT AND ESPECIALLY THE

00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:11.802 region:rollup2
TYPICAL STUDENT THE CALIFORNIA

00:46:10.301 --> 00:46:13.337 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

00:46:11.802 --> 00:46:14.705 region:rollup2
AS THE CHANCELLOR DESCRIBE YOUR

00:46:13.337 --> 00:46:16.407 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS HEARINGS WE SERVE A

00:46:14.705 --> 00:46:17.508 region:rollup2
MUCH BROADER GROUP OF STUDENTS

00:46:16.407 --> 00:46:18.542 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE TRYING TO DO EVEN MORE

00:46:17.508 --> 00:46:20.645 region:rollup2
TO REACH THOSE WERE STRANDED IN

00:46:18.542 --> 00:46:21.912 region:rollup2
THE WORKFORCE.

00:46:20.645 --> 00:46:23.347 region:rollup2
UNDER THE CURRENT STRUCTURE MOST

00:46:21.912 --> 00:46:24.915 region:rollup2
STUDENTS MUST COMPLETE COMPETE

00:46:23.347 --> 00:46:26.183 region:rollup2
FOR A LIMITED NUMBER OF AWARDS

00:46:24.915 --> 00:46:27.418 region:rollup2
AND THEIR CHANCES OF GETTING ONE

00:46:26.183 --> 00:46:28.819 region:rollup2
ARE EXCEEDINGLY LOW.

00:46:27.418 --> 00:46:30.554 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THAT STUDENTS IN OUR

00:46:28.819 --> 00:46:32.223 region:rollup2
COLLEGES WOULD SIMILAR LEVELS OF

00:46:30.554 --> 00:46:33.257 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL NEED VERY OFTEN

00:46:32.223 --> 00:46:35.226 region:rollup2
RECEIVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF

00:46:33.257 --> 00:46:36.394 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AID.

00:46:35.226 --> 00:46:38.029 region:rollup2
AND TO MAKE A POINT THAT WE CAN

00:46:36.394 --> 00:46:39.330 region:rollup2
DISCUSS IT YA AS PART OF YOUR

00:46:38.029 --> 00:46:39.897 region:rollup2
LAST PANEL BECAUSE SO MANY

00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:41.732 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ARE CURRENTLY RISKS

00:46:39.897 --> 00:46:43.534 region:rollup2
ARE.

00:46:41.732 --> 00:46:44.802 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SO FEW OF OUR STUDENTS

00:46:43.534 --> 00:46:46.604 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY RECEIVE THE CAL GRANT

00:46:44.802 --> 00:46:48.005 region:rollup2
SIMPLY GROWING THE CAL GRANT BE

00:46:46.604 --> 00:46:50.241 region:rollup2
ACCESS AWARD WHICH PROVIDES

00:46:48.005 --> 00:46:51.642 region:rollup2
FUNDS FOR NON TUITION COSTS OR

00:46:50.241 --> 00:46:53.210 region:rollup2
MAKING THE CAL GRANT.

00:46:51.642 --> 00:46:54.645 region:rollup2
ELIGIBILITY OR CAN I RECEIVED A

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:56.314 region:rollup2
CONDITION OF RECEIPT OF OTHER

00:46:54.645 --> 00:46:57.648 region:rollup2
FUNDS DOES NOT ADDRESS THE

00:46:56.314 --> 00:46:59.150 region:rollup2
AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES THAT

00:46:57.648 --> 00:47:01.052 region:rollup2
ARE FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS

00:46:59.150 --> 00:47:03.254 region:rollup2
FACE. AND SO WE WE WOULD

00:47:01.052 --> 00:47:04.622 region:rollup2
REITERATE THAT WE NEED TO THINK

00:47:03.254 --> 00:47:05.890 region:rollup2
ABOUT ELIGIBILITY TO.

00:47:04.622 --> 00:47:06.957 region:rollup2
I DON'T WANT A QUALIFIER

00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:08.392 region:rollup2
EXCITEMENT ABOUT THE DIRECTION

00:47:06.957 --> 00:47:10.227 region:rollup2
THAT THIS REPORT TAKES BECAUSE

00:47:08.392 --> 00:47:12.163 region:rollup2
WE ARE VERY EXCITED BUT AS YOU

00:47:10.227 --> 00:47:12.730 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION WE DO

00:47:12.163 --> 00:47:13.597 region:rollup2
WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE TRADE

00:47:12.730 --> 00:47:15.332 region:rollup2
OFFS.

00:47:13.597 --> 00:47:16.233 region:rollup2
WHEN WE'D RICH DETERMINE HOW TO

00:47:15.332 --> 00:47:17.702 region:rollup2
FUND THESE KINDS OF

00:47:16.233 --> 00:47:19.303 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:47:17.702 --> 00:47:21.939 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS IS AS

00:47:19.303 --> 00:47:23.607 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ALREADY RECEIVE A LESS

00:47:21.939 --> 00:47:25.176 region:rollup2
PER STUDENT THAN THEIR PEERS

00:47:23.607 --> 00:47:26.877 region:rollup2
THAT THE UC AND CSU BUT

00:47:25.176 --> 00:47:28.112 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS RECEIVE LESS FOR

00:47:26.877 --> 00:47:30.381 region:rollup2
THOSE STUDENTS THAN ARE. THEIR

00:47:28.112 --> 00:47:30.948 region:rollup2
PEERS OF THE UC AND CSU AND EVEN

00:47:30.381 --> 00:47:32.483 region:rollup2
LESS THAN.

00:47:30.948 --> 00:47:34.919 region:rollup2
OR CALL EVEN LESS THAN YOU

00:47:32.483 --> 00:47:35.686 region:rollup2
PROVIDE TO K. TWELVE ON A PER

00:47:34.919 --> 00:47:36.620 region:rollup2
STUDENT BASIS

00:47:35.686 --> 00:47:38.022 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO BE

00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:39.123 region:rollup2
COGNIZANT OF.

00:47:38.022 --> 00:47:41.058 region:rollup2
PUTTING NEW FUNDAMENTAL

PROPOSITION IDIOT.

00:47:44.028 --> 00:47:47.365 region:rollup2
MOVING ON WE THINK THE CONCEPT

00:48:48.559 --> 00:48:49.760 region:rollup2
APPROACHES TO OUR REACH WE HOPE

00:48:49.193 --> 00:48:51.695 region:rollup2
WE CAN.

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:52.930 region:rollup2
IT'S ABOUT DISCUSSION TO.

00:48:51.695 --> 00:48:55.499 region:rollup2
WITH THAT THAT HAVE UNANSWERED

00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:56.167 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS OKAY THANK YOU I KNOW

00:48:55.499 --> 00:48:57.868 region:rollup2
THAT WAS A LOT FOR ALL OF US TO.

00:48:56.167 --> 00:48:59.670 region:rollup2
TO TAKE IN.

00:48:57.868 --> 00:49:00.971 region:rollup2
BUT WE WANT TO I HAVE THE

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:02.807 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO TO GET

00:49:00.971 --> 00:49:04.275 region:rollup2
THE FEEDBACK FROM THAT SEGMENTS

00:49:02.807 --> 00:49:05.676 region:rollup2
ON ON THE REPORTS IT'S A JUST TO

00:49:04.275 --> 00:49:06.710 region:rollup2
REMIND THAT THE PUBLIC IN THE

00:49:05.676 --> 00:49:08.112 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE HERE.

00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:10.014 region:rollup2
THE GOAL THAT WE STARTED TWO

00:49:08.112 --> 00:49:12.082 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO WAS HOW CAN WE CHIU

00:49:10.014 --> 00:49:12.583 region:rollup2
MATIC WE EXPAND. FINANCE LADEN

00:49:12.082 --> 00:49:14.819 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA TO HELP MORE

00:49:12.583 --> 00:49:16.787 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

00:49:14.819 --> 00:49:18.456 region:rollup2
GRADUATE DEBT FREE TELLS A BIG

00:49:16.787 --> 00:49:20.124 region:rollup2
COMPONENT IS THAT SO MUCH OF THE

00:49:18.456 --> 00:49:21.959 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AID BURDEN.

00:49:20.124 --> 00:49:23.928 region:rollup2
SO MUCH OF THE FINANCIAL BURDEN

00:49:21.959 --> 00:49:25.529 region:rollup2
ON STUDENTS IS NOT JUST TUITION

00:49:23.928 --> 00:49:26.997 region:rollup2

WE KNOW THAT IT'S OUR FINANCIAL

00:49:26.997 --> 00:49:29.934 region:rollup2
AID STRUCTURE DOESN'T DOESN'T

00:49:28.265 --> 00:49:30.634 region:rollup2
COVER THAT ELEMENT SO I THINK

00:49:29.934 --> 00:49:32.536 region:rollup2
THAT'S A BIG PIECE OF IT.

00:49:30.634 --> 00:49:33.904 region:rollup2
.

00:49:32.536 --> 00:49:35.239 region:rollup2
ANOTHER COMPONENT IS OUR I I

00:49:33.904 --> 00:49:36.674 region:rollup2
THINK THERE ARE SOME PIECES THAT

00:49:35.239 --> 00:49:38.476 region:rollup2

OF THOSE THINGS TO FALL SO ONE I

00:50:33.163 --> 00:50:35.766 region:rollup2

HOPEFULLY EXPAND ACCESS LITTLE

00:50:54.251 --> 00:50:56.520 region:rollup2
BIT BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:58.389 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WE

00:50:56.520 --> 00:51:00.491 region:rollup2

COULD MANAGE THIS THIS THIS

00:51:08.966 --> 00:51:13.537 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TASK RIGHT SO WHETHER

00:51:11.001 --> 00:51:14.772 region:rollup2
IT'S. THINGS WE CAN DO THIS YEAR

00:51:13.537 --> 00:51:16.774 region:rollup2
SMALLER PIECES SMALLER CHUNKS.

00:51:14.772 --> 00:51:17.975 region:rollup2
.

00:51:16.774 --> 00:51:20.377 region:rollup2
AND DEBT WHILE YOU'RE THINKING

00:51:17.975 --> 00:51:22.379 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT ALSO WANTED JUST A

00:51:20.377 --> 00:51:23.814 region:rollup2
BUT A. NOT A FOLLOWUP PIECE

00:51:22.379 --> 00:51:25.849 region:rollup2
EITHER YOU OR THEIR OR THE

00:51:23.814 --> 00:51:28.118 region:rollup2
AUTHOR OF THE REPORT TO. MAYBE

AMOUNTS FOR SOME OF THESE PIECES

00:51:31.155 --> 00:51:33.290 region:rollup2
SO IT WASN'T EASILY.

00:51:32.356 --> 00:51:35.826 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE IT CAN THE REPORT WE

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:37.628 region:rollup2
HAVE BEFORE US TODAY.

00:51:35.826 --> 00:51:39.797 region:rollup2
JOINING.

00:51:37.628 --> 00:51:40.898 region:rollup2
SO I'M WHAT WE PROPOSE TODAY AS

00:51:39.797 --> 00:51:42.099 region:rollup2
THE THREE CERTAIN COMPONENTS

00:51:40.898 --> 00:51:44.134 region:rollup2
THAT WE THOUGHT WOULD BE HELPFUL

00:51:42.099 --> 00:51:46.470 region:rollup2
BUT. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

00:51:44.134 --> 00:51:47.137 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW OF THE INNOVATION FIND

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:49.573 region:rollup2
WOULD BE WHATEVER THE

00:51:47.137 --> 00:51:51.742 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE OF FELT THAT WAS.

00:51:49.573 --> 00:51:53.811 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF IN TERMS OF AN

00:51:51.742 --> 00:51:54.878 region:rollup2
AMOUNT IF WE WANTED TO TEST SOME

00:51:53.811 --> 00:51:57.648 region:rollup2
OF THESE THEORIES OUT AND

00:51:54.878 --> 00:51:59.883 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITIES THE. OF INCREASING

00:51:57.648 --> 00:52:01.151 region:rollup2
THE ACCESS AWARD OBVIOUSLY IF

00:51:59.883 --> 00:52:02.286 region:rollup2
YOU INTEREST KRISTA TO EIGHTEEN

00:52:01.151 --> 00:52:03.754 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FOR INSTANCE WOULD BE

00:52:02.286 --> 00:52:05.122 region:rollup2
THIRTY ONE MILLION IF YOU

00:52:03.754 --> 00:52:06.123 region:rollup2
INCREASED IT TO TWENTY FOUR

00:52:05.122 --> 00:52:08.025 region:rollup2
HUNDRED IT WOULD BE

00:52:06.123 --> 00:52:10.260 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE ABOUT A

00:52:08.025 --> 00:52:10.527 region:rollup2
HUNDRED SIXTY TWO I'M. SORRY IT

00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:12.229 region:rollup2
WOULD BE.

00:52:10.527 --> 00:52:13.397 region:rollup2
.

00:52:12.229 --> 00:52:14.331 region:rollup2
TO TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED THREE

00:52:13.397 --> 00:52:15.366 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION TO

00:52:14.331 --> 00:52:17.067 region:rollup2
THREE THOUSAND AND BE TWO

00:52:15.366 --> 00:52:18.535 region:rollup2
HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION SO

00:52:17.067 --> 00:52:20.371 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE THAT FOR EACH OF THE

00:52:18.535 --> 00:52:21.405 region:rollup2
STAGES RIGHT NOW AND THAT'S JUST

00:52:20.371 --> 00:52:23.007 region:rollup2
A THREE THOUSAND BUT IF WE WERE

00:52:21.405 --> 00:52:24.375 region:rollup2
TO GO TO SIX THOUSAND. WE HAVE

00:52:23.007 --> 00:52:26.443 region:rollup2
THOSE COSTS AS WELL.

00:52:24.375 --> 00:52:27.945 region:rollup2
IT IS IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT

00:52:26.443 --> 00:52:28.946 region:rollup2
WHAT THE VALUE OF THE BE ACCESS

00:52:27.945 --> 00:52:30.414 region:rollup2
AWARD IS A LOT OF HIS TUNES ARE

00:52:28.946 --> 00:52:31.582 region:rollup2
GRADUATING IN TIME BECAUSE THEY

00:52:30.414 --> 00:52:33.517 region:rollup2
FEEL THE NEED TO HAVE TO WORK

00:52:31.582 --> 00:52:34.918 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T MAKE ENDS

00:52:33.517 --> 00:52:37.388 region:rollup2
MEET BE ABLE TO STUDY FULL TIME.

00:52:34.918 --> 00:52:38.922 region:rollup2
IT SO I WE DO BELIEVE THAT.

00:52:37.388 --> 00:52:40.491 region:rollup2
WHOLEHEARTEDLY THAT INCREASINGLY

00:52:38.922 --> 00:52:42.092 region:rollup2
ACTS WORDS VERY IMPORTANT

00:52:40.491 --> 00:52:43.861 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY ITEM CAN DEBATE

00:52:42.092 --> 00:52:45.429 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT. THE OUTREACH

00:52:43.861 --> 00:52:47.664 region:rollup2
COMPONENT OF THEM IS ESSENTIAL

00:52:45.429 --> 00:52:48.899 region:rollup2
BUT WE WE SERVE STUDENTS WHILE

00:52:47.664 --> 00:52:50.067 region:rollup2
BEFORE THEY EVEN APPLY TO

00:52:48.899 --> 00:52:50.734 region:rollup2
COLLEGE WHO WERE SERVING

00:52:50.067 --> 00:52:52.369 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

00:52:50.734 --> 00:52:52.970 region:rollup2
WHILE THEY'RE STILL IN HIGH

00:52:52.369 --> 00:52:54.838 region:rollup2
SCHOOL AND THEIR FAMILIES IN

00:52:52.970 --> 00:52:56.807 region:rollup2
FACT WE HAVE A COUPLE OUTREACH

00:52:54.838 --> 00:52:58.542 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT KELSO ABOUT REPOSE

00:52:56.807 --> 00:52:59.677 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IN THE CASH BECAUSE IT

00:52:58.542 --> 00:53:00.177 region:rollup2
YOU'RE PRETTY FAMILIAR WITH AS

00:52:59.677 --> 00:53:01.812 region:rollup2
WELL SO.

00:53:00.177 --> 00:53:04.148 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE THINK THAT'S AN

00:53:01.812 --> 00:53:06.383 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT COMPONENT HOWEVER IF.

00:53:04.148 --> 00:53:08.519 region:rollup2
IF THE LEGISLATURE'S INTERESTED

00:53:06.383 --> 00:53:10.654 region:rollup2
IN SIR FOR INSTANCE REMOVING THE

00:53:08.519 --> 00:53:11.789 region:rollup2
DOUGHNUT HOLE AYE BUT WE BELIEVE

00:53:10.654 --> 00:53:13.190 region:rollup2
IN WE CAN GET YOU THESE COST

00:53:11.789 --> 00:53:14.992 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES OF COURSE IN THE DON'T

00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:15.726 region:rollup2
A WHOLE MEANS. OF FOR A FAMILY

00:53:14.992 --> 00:53:18.662 region:rollup2
COULD EXCITE ME EXPLAIN WHAT

00:53:15.726 --> 00:53:22.032 region:rollup2
THAT IS. SO FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR

00:53:18.662 --> 00:53:22.533 region:rollup2
THAT MAKES BETWEEN ZERO AND A

00:53:22.032 --> 00:53:24.768 region:rollup2
FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:53:22.533 --> 00:53:26.003 region:rollup2
IF THE STUDENT HAS A TWO POINT

00:53:24.768 --> 00:53:27.671 region:rollup2
OH GPA YOU'RE GOOD TO GO TO CAL

00:53:26.003 --> 00:53:29.006 region:rollup2
GRANT.

00:53:27.671 --> 00:53:30.040 region:rollup2
IF A FAMILY OF FOUR THE MIX

00:53:29.006 --> 00:53:31.575 region:rollup2
BETWEEN ZERO AND A HUNDRED

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:32.276 region:rollup2
THOUSAND.

00:53:31.575 --> 00:53:33.977 region:rollup2
OKAY.

00:53:32.276 --> 00:53:35.546 region:rollup2
AND.

00:53:33.977 --> 00:53:36.680 region:rollup2
MAKES THREE POINT HAS A THREE

00:53:35.546 --> 00:53:37.781 region:rollup2
POINT EIGHT GPA THEY ALSO GET A

00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:39.483 region:rollup2
CAL GRANT.

00:53:37.781 --> 00:53:42.119 region:rollup2
FOR THE STUDENT.

00:53:39.483 --> 00:53:44.221 region:rollup2
OF THE IS AT FIFTY TWO THOUSAND

00:53:42.119 --> 00:53:45.322 region:rollup2
A FIFTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:53:44.221 --> 00:53:46.490 region:rollup2
AND AS A TWO POINT NINE GPA THEY

00:53:45.322 --> 00:53:48.492 region:rollup2
GET NOTHING.

00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:51.128 region:rollup2
NOTHING.

00:53:48.492 --> 00:53:52.663 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE'S THE THE THE TO

00:53:51.128 --> 00:53:54.798 region:rollup2
POINT OUT THREE POINT NOW IS

00:53:52.663 --> 00:53:57.234 region:rollup2
SORT OF THE. OF THE BASIS FOR

00:53:54.798 --> 00:53:57.801 region:rollup2
THE INCREASING OF THE WHAT THE

00:53:57.234 --> 00:53:59.503 region:rollup2
HOUSEHOLD COULD BANKRATE WE

00:53:57.801 --> 00:54:01.605 region:rollup2
KNOW.

00:53:59.503 --> 00:54:04.341 region:rollup2
THAT IT UC BERKELEY FOR INSTANCE

00:54:01.605 --> 00:54:04.875 region:rollup2
TO ATTEND ACOSTA ATTENDANCES

00:54:04.341 --> 00:54:06.710 region:rollup2
WHAT THIRTY TO THIRTY FIVE

00:54:04.875 --> 00:54:08.078 region:rollup2
THOUSAND.

00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:10.214 region:rollup2
DEPENDING ON LIVING SITUATION

00:54:08.078 --> 00:54:11.682 region:rollup2
AND SO EVEN FOR A FAMILY MAKING

00:54:10.214 --> 00:54:12.649 region:rollup2
SEVENTY OR EIGHTY THOUSAND THEY

00:54:11.682 --> 00:54:14.284 region:rollup2
COULDN'T AFFORD SENDING THEIR

00:54:12.649 --> 00:54:15.786 region:rollup2
STUDENTS OF UC BERKELEY WITHOUT

00:54:14.284 --> 00:54:17.354 region:rollup2
SOME SORT OF GRANT IT MIND YOU

00:54:15.786 --> 00:54:19.857 region:rollup2
THEY MIGHT GET. AND SOME

00:54:17.354 --> 00:54:21.625 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONAL AID LOANS AND.

00:54:19.857 --> 00:54:23.260 region:rollup2
WHAT HAVE YOU BUT IT WOULD BE

00:54:21.625 --> 00:54:25.863 region:rollup2
EXORBITANT SO THERE'S THAT

00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:27.030 region:rollup2
DOUGHNUT HOLE AND THAT'S WORTH

00:54:25.863 --> 00:54:29.500 region:rollup2
AND I'M LOOKING BACK AT DAVID?

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:30.434 region:rollup2
FIFTY MILLION OR SO.

00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:31.869 region:rollup2
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF FIFTY

00:54:30.434 --> 00:54:32.903 region:rollup2
MILLION TO CLOSE THAT DOUGHNUT

00:54:31.869 --> 00:54:34.838 region:rollup2
HOLES WHAT WE CALL IF WE WERE TO

00:54:32.903 --> 00:54:36.039 region:rollup2
ELIMINATE NOW WE KNOW THAT CSU

00:54:34.838 --> 00:54:38.208 region:rollup2
AND YOU SEE. THE PRETTY

00:54:36.039 --> 00:54:40.978 region:rollup2
COMPETITIVE BUT WHAT'S WE WE IN

00:54:38.208 --> 00:54:42.379 region:rollup2
THE PASSPORT SAVING PURPOSES WE

00:54:40.978 --> 00:54:44.515 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED AT GPA REQUIREMENT

00:54:42.379 --> 00:54:46.950 region:rollup2
WE KNOW HOW COMPETITIVE UC AND

00:54:44.515 --> 00:54:50.187 region:rollup2
CSU IS SHOULD WE NOT LEAVE.

00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:52.189 region:rollup2
THAT TO THE UNIVERSITY IF THERE

00:54:50.187 --> 00:54:55.225 region:rollup2
THE STUDENT IS OF WORTHY ENOUGH

00:54:52.189 --> 00:54:57.628 region:rollup2
TO GO RECEIVE ADMITTANCE TO A

00:54:55.225 --> 00:54:59.263 region:rollup2
CSU THEN WE SHOULD. PROVIDE THEM

00:54:57.628 --> 00:55:00.397 region:rollup2
THE FINANCIALLY THEY NEED TO GO

00:54:59.263 --> 00:55:01.732 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO THAT'S ONE OF THE

00:55:00.397 --> 00:55:03.367 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS OF COURSE.

00:55:01.732 --> 00:55:05.869 region:rollup2
IN THE REPORT AS WELL AND THEN

00:55:03.367 --> 00:55:07.404 region:rollup2
THE ONE YEAR OUT SITUATION SO WE

00:55:05.869 --> 00:55:09.907 region:rollup2
ARE VERY GENEROUS IN CALIFORNIA

00:55:07.404 --> 00:55:11.108 region:rollup2

RECEIVE FINANCIALLY THAT'S

00:55:14.311 --> 00:55:17.247 region:rollup2
CALLED AN ENTITLEMENT BUT IF YOU

00:55:15.813 --> 00:55:18.882 region:rollup2
WAIT A YEAR AND A DAY AFTER

00:55:17.247 --> 00:55:20.651 region:rollup2
GRADUATION DECIDE TO GO BACK TO

00:55:18.882 --> 00:55:22.319 region:rollup2
SCHOOL AND MANY STUDENTS DO. YOU

00:55:20.651 --> 00:55:24.188 region:rollup2
ARE NO LONGER ON THE ENTITLEMENT

00:55:22.319 --> 00:55:25.556 region:rollup2
LIST THERE IS A LIST OF ABOUT

00:55:24.188 --> 00:55:28.659 region:rollup2
THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND

00:55:25.556 --> 00:55:29.226 region:rollup2
STUDENTS FOR TWENTY FIVE

00:55:28.659 --> 00:55:29.459 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY

00:55:29.226 --> 00:55:30.594 region:rollup2
AWARDS.

00:55:29.459 --> 00:55:33.230 region:rollup2
THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FOR ANYONE

00:55:30.594 --> 00:55:33.864 region:rollup2
ABOVE THE ENTITLEMENT AN OLDER

00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:35.532 region:rollup2
THAN.

00:55:33.864 --> 00:55:37.067 region:rollup2
SORT OF AND IF THAT DIDN'T GET

00:55:35.532 --> 00:55:38.602 region:rollup2
IN RIGHT AWAY THAT MADE A

00:55:37.067 --> 00:55:40.204 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT DECISION UP OR

00:55:38.602 --> 00:55:42.105 region:rollup2
COULDN'T NEEDED TO WORKER YOU

00:55:40.204 --> 00:55:43.874 region:rollup2
KNOW SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO. SO

00:55:42.105 --> 00:55:45.342 region:rollup2
WE REALLY DO NEED TO ADDRESS

00:55:43.874 --> 00:55:46.977 region:rollup2
THAT AS WELL.

00:55:45.342 --> 00:55:48.946 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

00:55:46.977 --> 00:55:49.713 region:rollup2
SO THOSE TWO COMPONENTS RIGHT

00:55:48.946 --> 00:55:52.416 region:rollup2
THERE.

00:55:49.713 --> 00:55:53.317 region:rollup2
WOULD HELP CLOSE SOME GAPS.

00:55:52.416 --> 00:55:55.552 region:rollup2
AND WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO PUT

00:55:53.317 --> 00:55:56.653 region:rollup2
SOME A ESTIMATES TOGETHER FOR

00:55:55.552 --> 00:55:57.754 region:rollup2
YOU IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT WOULD

00:55:56.653 --> 00:55:59.256 region:rollup2
COST ANOTHER IF YOU WANTED TO

00:55:57.754 --> 00:55:59.856 region:rollup2
ADD ANYTHING.

00:55:59.256 --> 00:56:01.992 region:rollup2
RETIREMENT UMBEL IN TERMS OF

00:55:59.856 --> 00:56:03.560 region:rollup2
SORT OF A MENU OF OF ITEMS.

00:56:01.992 --> 00:56:06.029 region:rollup2
.

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:09.299 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY THE.

00:56:06.029 --> 00:56:10.801 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:56:09.299 --> 00:56:12.002 region:rollup2
THAT THE CHEAPEST THING THAT YOU

00:56:10.801 --> 00:56:14.137 region:rollup2
COULD DO THAT WOULD HAVE THE

00:56:12.002 --> 00:56:16.440 region:rollup2
BIGGEST IMPACT WOULD BE SOME OF

00:56:14.137 --> 00:56:17.674 region:rollup2
THE EARLY INFORMATION KINDS OF

00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:19.509 region:rollup2
EFFORTS WHICH.

00:56:17.674 --> 00:56:21.345 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW MAYBE A FEW MILLION

00:56:19.509 --> 00:56:23.046 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IT'S NOT HERE AND NOT A

00:56:21.345 --> 00:56:23.614 region:rollup2
HUGE HUGE INVESTMENT BUT THE

00:56:23.046 --> 00:56:26.016 region:rollup2
KIND OF THING WE'RE TALKING

00:56:23.614 --> 00:56:27.584 region:rollup2
ABOUT HERE. IS NOT JUST SOME

00:56:26.016 --> 00:56:29.519 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL PEOPLE FOR OUTREACH.

00:56:27.584 --> 00:56:32.456 region:rollup2
BUT A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

00:56:29.519 --> 00:56:34.124 region:rollup2
SYSTEMIC APPROACH TO PROVIDING

00:56:32.456 --> 00:56:36.059 region:rollup2

YOU MAYBE. DON'T REALIZE WHAT

00:56:42.099 --> 00:56:46.536 region:rollup2
THEY'RE WHAT THEIR OPTIONS ARE

00:56:43.734 --> 00:56:46.536 region:rollup2
SO FOR EXAMPLE.

00:56:46.603 --> 00:56:49.773 region:rollup2
BIT IN THE REPORT THERE'S

00:56:48.605 --> 00:56:52.409 region:rollup2

THE CALIFORNIA STATE NAY

00:57:02.486 --> 00:57:04.855 region:rollup2
COMMISSION COULD HAVE A WEBSITE

SITUATION.

00:57:25.709 --> 00:57:29.413 region:rollup2
FOR CS YOU YOU SEE LOCAL

PRIVATE COLLEGE.

00:57:30.547 --> 00:57:33.583 region:rollup2
THAT'S KIND OF INFORMATION THAT

00:57:32.215 --> 00:57:35.686 region:rollup2
IF IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING

00:57:33.583 --> 00:57:38.889 region:rollup2
YOU CAN NOW LIKE GO TO A CAN TO

AND AND GET AN ESTIMATE BACK BUT

00:57:44.761 --> 00:57:48.365 region:rollup2
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE

00:57:46.596 --> 00:57:50.600 region:rollup2
A TO EVEN KNOW THAT THEY CAN DO

00:57:48.365 --> 00:57:52.369 region:rollup2
THAT OR BE. TO DO THAT ON

00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:54.604 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE COLLEGE WEBSITES AND

00:57:52.369 --> 00:57:55.339 region:rollup2
GET IN AND GET SOMETHING THAT IS

00:57:54.604 --> 00:57:57.407 region:rollup2
COMPARATIVE.

NOBODY DOES IT.

00:57:57.407 --> 00:57:59.609 region:rollup2

COMMISSION AND.

00:58:00.477 --> 00:58:06.116 region:rollup2
COULD NOT COULD IMPLEMENT.

00:58:03.981 --> 00:58:08.018 region:rollup2
BASED ON DATA SYSTEMS THAT ARE

00:58:06.116 --> 00:58:09.453 region:rollup2
OUT THAT OUT THERE NOW WHITE

00:58:08.018 --> 00:58:10.687 region:rollup2
WOULD KNOW THOUGH THAT THEY THE

GRANT DELIVERY SYSTEM

00:58:10.687 --> 00:58:13.423 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT THAT THAT IS ALSO

00:58:12.089 --> 00:58:15.692 region:rollup2
PART OF THE BUDGET ISN'T IS

00:58:13.423 --> 00:58:17.861 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT ALL OF THAT. BUT THAT.

00:58:15.692 --> 00:58:21.064 region:rollup2
THAT KIND OF A MOVE IS TOTALLY

00:58:17.861 --> 00:58:22.666 region:rollup2
DOABLE WE ALSO SUGGEST THAT.

00:58:21.064 --> 00:58:23.934 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN TRYING TO RATHER

00:58:22.666 --> 00:58:25.302 region:rollup2
THAN A BIG INFORMATION CAMPAIGN

00:58:23.934 --> 00:58:27.204 region:rollup2
OR IN ADDITION TO AN INFORMATION

00:58:25.302 --> 00:58:28.205 region:rollup2
CAMPAIGN TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO

00:58:27.204 --> 00:58:30.140 region:rollup2
GET ACCESS TO SOMETHING LIKE

00:58:28.205 --> 00:58:31.875 region:rollup2
THAT. YUKI IT COULD EVEN HAVE

00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:33.310 region:rollup2
SOMETHING LIKE A CHECK BOX ON

00:58:31.875 --> 00:58:35.345 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA STATE INCOME TAX

00:58:33.310 --> 00:58:36.446 region:rollup2

AFFORDABILITY.

00:58:39.916 --> 00:58:44.588 region:rollup2
COMPARISON SOMETHING SO THAT IT

00:58:42.252 --> 00:58:46.723 region:rollup2
IS A SYSTEMIC. KIND OF.

00:58:44.588 --> 00:58:49.259 region:rollup2
KIND OF APPROACH IT'S IMPORTANT

00:58:46.723 --> 00:58:51.094 region:rollup2
FOR CEASE ACTIVE THEN ALSO HAVE

00:58:49.259 --> 00:58:52.529 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS

00:58:51.094 --> 00:58:54.865 region:rollup2
WHEN QUESTIONS COME UP.

00:58:52.529 --> 00:58:55.365 region:rollup2
BUT CERTAINLY THE THE KIND OF

00:58:54.865 --> 00:58:56.867 region:rollup2

MAKE SURE IS THAT ESPECIALLY CSU

00:59:58.662 --> 01:00:02.265 region:rollup2
IS MADE.

01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:04.067 region:rollup2
IS MADE WHOLE IF YOU IMPLEMENT

01:00:02.265 --> 01:00:06.102 region:rollup2
IT AND DON'T ADEQUATELY FUNDED

01:00:04.067 --> 01:00:07.571 region:rollup2
ALICE AS WAS INDICATED YOU COULD

01:00:06.102 --> 01:00:09.239 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY END UP IN A SITUATION

01:00:07.571 --> 01:00:10.841 region:rollup2
WHERE SOME PEOPLE LOSE OUT WE

01:00:09.239 --> 01:00:12.642 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT WE WANTED THIS TO BE

01:00:10.841 --> 01:00:15.879 region:rollup2
AN AD SITUATION.

01:00:12.642 --> 01:00:17.747 region:rollup2
AND NOT A SUBTRACTION SO I'D AT

01:00:15.879 --> 01:00:20.317 region:rollup2
OUR ESTIMATE WAS A COUPLE OF

01:00:17.747 --> 01:00:22.552 region:rollup2
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR CS

01:00:20.317 --> 01:00:25.055 region:rollup2
YOU AND THAT SITUATION.

01:00:22.552 --> 01:00:26.690 region:rollup2
I'M NEITHER ASTERISK THERE.

01:00:25.055 --> 01:00:28.925 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE MOST

01:00:26.690 --> 01:00:32.462 region:rollup2
PRISING THINGS WE FOUND WAS HOW

01:00:28.925 --> 01:00:34.331 region:rollup2
LITTLE DATA SEE SACK HAS OTHERS

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:36.433 region:rollup2
HAVE ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF DATA.

01:00:34.331 --> 01:00:39.102 region:rollup2
BUT ACTUALLY SEES THAT DOESN'T

01:00:36.433 --> 01:00:41.872 region:rollup2
KNOW. WHICH WHO ENROLLED OR

01:00:39.102 --> 01:00:43.640 region:rollup2
DIDN'T IN WHICH I HAVE WATCHED

01:00:41.872 --> 01:00:44.441 region:rollup2
IT WHAT INSTITUTIONS THEY GOT A

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.342 region:rollup2
CAL GRANT THEY KNOW THEY'RE

01:00:44.441 --> 01:00:47.377 region:rollup2
GETTING A CAR GOING TO GO TO

01:00:45.342 --> 01:00:49.446 region:rollup2
THAT PARTICULAR INSTITUTION. BUT

01:00:47.377 --> 01:00:50.213 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY TO DO THINGS LIKE

01:00:49.446 --> 01:00:52.082 region:rollup2
COST ESTIMATES.

01:00:50.213 --> 01:00:55.585 region:rollup2
USING THE DATA THAT'S AVAILABLE

01:00:52.082 --> 01:00:57.120 region:rollup2
TO SEE SACCHI IS IS A VERY.

01:00:55.585 --> 01:00:59.189 region:rollup2
LIMITED.

01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:00.790 region:rollup2
BUILDING THAT AND OVER TIME

01:00:59.189 --> 01:01:03.527 region:rollup2
WILL BE VERY USEFUL AND SORT OF

01:01:00.790 --> 01:01:06.463 region:rollup2
ANALYZING WHERE WE ARE GAPS ARE.

01:01:03.527 --> 01:01:09.232 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD AND AS YOU SAID

01:01:06.463 --> 01:01:10.700 region:rollup2
THAT THAT IT'S. ADDRESSING DEBT

01:01:09.232 --> 01:01:12.435 region:rollup2
IS A TWO BILLION DOLLAR ISSUE.

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:13.637 region:rollup2
AN IMPORTANT PLACE TO START IS

01:01:12.435 --> 01:01:15.105 region:rollup2
WITH MORE FUNDS FOR THE

01:01:13.637 --> 01:01:16.907 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

01:01:15.105 --> 01:01:19.209 region:rollup2
IN AT EITHER A CONSOLIDATED OR

01:01:16.907 --> 01:01:21.344 region:rollup2
AT LEAST TO START A CAL GRANT BE

01:01:19.209 --> 01:01:22.412 region:rollup2
KIND OF A PROJECT.

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:23.847 region:rollup2
AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT LATER

01:01:22.412 --> 01:01:25.682 region:rollup2
BUT THE COMMUNICABLE SPACES GOT

01:01:23.847 --> 01:01:27.484 region:rollup2
ONLY GENERAL FUND BUT WE COULD

01:01:25.682 --> 01:01:30.387 region:rollup2
DISCUSS THAT UNDER PROPAGANDHI

01:01:27.484 --> 01:01:32.522 region:rollup2
EIGHT. YOU KNOW WE HAD I THINK

01:01:30.387 --> 01:01:34.324 region:rollup2
IT MIGHT. YEARS PLAYER LAST YEAR

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:36.760 region:rollup2
A YEAR BEFORE THE FIRST YEAR AND

01:01:34.324 --> 01:01:37.360 region:rollup2
HAD A DEBATE ABOUT FINANCIAL AID

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:37.961 region:rollup2
WERE LOOKING ABOUT TO BE WANT

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:38.395 region:rollup2
TO.

01:01:37.961 --> 01:01:40.263 region:rollup2
EXPAND THE NUMBER OF

01:01:38.395 --> 01:01:43.533 region:rollup2
COMPETITIVE.

01:01:40.263 --> 01:01:45.535 region:rollup2
AWARDS OR EXPAND OR INCREASE

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:47.804 region:rollup2
THE AWARD AMOUNT AND SO.

01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:48.572 region:rollup2
WE AT THINK WE ASK IF YOU PASSED

01:01:47.804 --> 01:01:50.473 region:rollup2
YOU MAY BE IN HYPOTHETICAL BE

01:01:48.572 --> 01:01:52.309 region:rollup2
ONLY HAD. FIFTY MILLION BUCKS

01:01:50.473 --> 01:01:53.944 region:rollup2
WHICH I WOULD YOU CHOOSE A

01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:55.245 region:rollup2
PRIMARY GUY I CAN DO THAT.

01:01:53.944 --> 01:01:57.080 region:rollup2
SO IT JUST COMES DOWN TO THE

01:01:55.245 --> 01:01:58.748 region:rollup2
SAME ISSUE AGAIN YOU KNOW. THE

01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:00.083 region:rollup2
DOUGHNUT HOLE VERSUS THE ACCESO

01:01:58.748 --> 01:02:01.551 region:rollup2
WORKS AT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:02:00.083 --> 01:02:03.186 region:rollup2
MISSED OUT ON THE DON'T HOLE ARE

01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:03.587 region:rollup2
THEY NOT GOING TO COLLEGE WHAT

01:02:03.186 --> 01:02:05.188 region:rollup2
HAPPENS TO THEM.

01:02:03.587 --> 01:02:06.656 region:rollup2
IF THERE.

01:02:05.188 --> 01:02:09.526 region:rollup2
DO THEY GO TO THAT SEE IS YOU

01:02:06.656 --> 01:02:12.395 region:rollup2
AND TRY TO GET THAT SAGA AWARD

01:02:09.526 --> 01:02:13.997 region:rollup2
TO TO PAY FOR IT OR AT THE YOU

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:15.799 region:rollup2
SEE. YOU IN OTHER WORDS.

01:02:13.997 --> 01:02:16.933 region:rollup2
WHICH WANTED WHICH PIECES GIVES

01:02:15.799 --> 01:02:18.001 region:rollup2
US THE BIGGEST.

01:02:16.933 --> 01:02:19.769 region:rollup2
BANG FOR OUR BUCK

01:02:18.001 --> 01:02:20.637 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS.

01:02:19.769 --> 01:02:23.440 region:rollup2
HELPING EXPAND

01:02:20.637 --> 01:02:24.774 region:rollup2
COLLEGE ACCESS

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:26.243 region:rollup2
BUT CERTAIN THE AND THEY DO WHAT

01:02:24.774 --> 01:02:27.811 region:rollup2
I DID FIND A RECENTLY THAT IF IF

01:02:26.243 --> 01:02:29.512 region:rollup2
A STUDENT DOESN'T RECEIVE A CAL

01:02:27.811 --> 01:02:30.814 region:rollup2
GRANT VOTE SAAB THEY DO RECEIVE

01:02:29.512 --> 01:02:33.450 region:rollup2
A STUDENT AT UNIVERSITY. OF

01:02:30.814 --> 01:02:35.518 region:rollup2
STATE UNIVERSITY GRANT FROM THE.

01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:37.887 region:rollup2
CSU SYSTEM AND I'M SURE THAT

01:02:35.518 --> 01:02:39.689 region:rollup2
IT'S SIMILAR FOR A UC SYSTEM IN

01:02:37.887 --> 01:02:42.192 region:rollup2
TERMS OF THAT. DOUGHNUT HOLE

01:02:39.689 --> 01:02:43.260 region:rollup2
WHAT AND THAT THAT COVERS TO

01:02:42.192 --> 01:02:44.894 region:rollup2
WISHIN.

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:47.063 region:rollup2
BUT THE COST OF ATTENDANCE IS

01:02:44.894 --> 01:02:47.697 region:rollup2
STILL AN ISSUE. RIGHT AND SO

01:02:47.063 --> 01:02:49.899 region:rollup2
MANY OF THOSE THINGS HAVE TO

01:02:47.697 --> 01:02:51.101 region:rollup2
TAKE ADDITIONAL LOANS TO MAKE

01:02:49.899 --> 01:02:53.303 region:rollup2
ENDS MEET RIGHT.

01:02:51.101 --> 01:02:56.406 region:rollup2
.

01:02:53.303 --> 01:02:58.074 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SO SO FAT STUDENT WOULD

01:02:56.406 --> 01:02:59.476 region:rollup2
HAVE GOTTEN THE CAL GRANT. THEY

01:02:58.074 --> 01:03:01.444 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE GOTTEN THE SAGER THE

01:02:59.476 --> 01:03:03.346 region:rollup2
UC AWARD TO PAY TO HELP PAY FOR

01:03:01.444 --> 01:03:05.548 region:rollup2
THEIR NON TUITION AND NOW THEY

01:03:03.346 --> 01:03:06.950 region:rollup2
DON'T GET BACK THAT JUST PAYS

01:03:05.548 --> 01:03:08.385 region:rollup2
FOR TUITION SO YOU'RE SAYING.

01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:09.019 region:rollup2
I THINK SO BUT THEY COULD

01:03:08.385 --> 01:03:12.222 region:rollup2
PROBABLY ANSWER THAT BETTER THAN

01:03:09.019 --> 01:03:12.822 region:rollup2
I.

01:03:12.222 --> 01:03:13.923 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THE UNIVERSITIES

01:03:12.822 --> 01:03:15.558 region:rollup2
AFFECTED WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS WE

01:03:13.923 --> 01:03:17.761 region:rollup2
STILL TRYING TO FILL THAT GAP TO

01:03:15.558 --> 01:03:18.795 region:rollup2
KEEP THAT WON'T WORK MANAGEABLE

01:03:17.761 --> 01:03:20.296 region:rollup2
SO WITH THE STUDENT DOESN'T

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:21.898 region:rollup2
RECEIVE THE CAL GRANT. THE END

01:03:20.296 --> 01:03:24.334 region:rollup2
UP GETTING THE SAME AMOUNT OF

01:03:21.898 --> 01:03:26.002 region:rollup2
GRANT TOTAL THAT THEY WOULD GET

01:03:24.334 --> 01:03:27.437 region:rollup2
WE WOULD JUST SHIFT SOURCES TO

01:03:26.002 --> 01:03:29.572 region:rollup2
TRY TO KEEP THAT CONSISTENT

01:03:27.437 --> 01:03:31.307 region:rollup2
WON'T WORK IN ALL CASES. NOW TO

01:03:29.572 --> 01:03:31.875 region:rollup2
THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS A DON'T

01:03:31.307 --> 01:03:33.843 region:rollup2
HOLD THAT MEANS THERE'S LESS

01:03:31.875 --> 01:03:35.312 region:rollup2
GRANT MONEY UNIVERSITY WIDE

01:03:33.843 --> 01:03:37.814 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE AND THAT'S ALL GRANT

01:03:35.312 --> 01:03:39.115 region:rollup2
TO SIT ALL GRANT RECIPIENTS. ARE

01:03:37.814 --> 01:03:40.717 region:rollup2
BORROWING WORKING A LITTLE BIT

01:03:39.115 --> 01:03:42.585 region:rollup2
MORE SO SORT AFFECTS ALL

01:03:40.717 --> 01:03:44.254 region:rollup2
STUDENTS THE EFFECTIVELY SPREAD

01:03:42.585 --> 01:03:46.856 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE SCREEN. AS OPPOSED TO

01:03:44.254 --> 01:03:47.424 region:rollup2
BEING ISOLATED TO THOSE STUDENTS

01:03:46.856 --> 01:03:48.892 region:rollup2
WHO AFFECTED DIRECTLY BY THE

01:03:47.424 --> 01:03:50.560 region:rollup2
DOUGHNUT HOLE.

01:03:48.892 --> 01:03:51.194 region:rollup2
SO BACK THEY QUESTIONS VIRUS IF

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:57.901 region:rollup2
IF WE HAD TO CHOOSE WE HAD WHICH

01:03:51.194 --> 01:04:07.343 region:rollup2
ONE IS IS IS MORE

01:03:57.901 --> 01:04:10.213 region:rollup2
VALUABLE. TODAY.

01:04:07.343 --> 01:04:11.648 region:rollup2
CHAVEZ I THINK IT INCREASE IN

01:04:10.213 --> 01:04:12.716 region:rollup2
BODY AS I IT'S REALLY HARD TO

01:04:11.648 --> 01:04:14.884 region:rollup2
SAY I MEAN I THINK AND. I THINK

01:04:12.716 --> 01:04:15.719 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT

01:04:14.884 --> 01:04:17.087 region:rollup2
THE COST OF ATTENDANCE.

01:04:15.719 --> 01:04:17.754 region:rollup2
WE ABSOLUTE NEED TO DO SOMETHING

01:04:17.087 --> 01:04:18.755 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE COST WITH TENANTS AND

01:04:17.754 --> 01:04:20.156 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW THE WAY WE DO THAT IS

01:04:18.755 --> 01:04:21.591 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE BE ACCESO WAR.

01:04:20.156 --> 01:04:23.460 region:rollup2
SONY TO REALLY CONSIDER AND

01:04:21.591 --> 01:04:24.194 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT IT YOU KNOW WHAT

01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:25.729 region:rollup2
WITH HOW WE'RE SETTING UP

01:04:24.194 --> 01:04:27.263 region:rollup2
STUDENTS BASICALLY YES YOU CAN

01:04:25.729 --> 01:04:28.765 region:rollup2
GET IN AND HERE'S A LITTLE MONEY

01:04:27.263 --> 01:04:30.133 region:rollup2
FOR TUITION BUT. GOOD LUCK WITH

01:04:28.765 --> 01:04:31.501 region:rollup2
THE REST OF IT.

01:04:30.133 --> 01:04:32.769 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE SEEING THAT PLAY OUT

01:04:31.501 --> 01:04:33.937 region:rollup2
THROUGH HOUSING FOOD INSECURITY

01:04:32.769 --> 01:04:35.772 region:rollup2
WE'RE SEEING THAT PLAY OUT

01:04:33.937 --> 01:04:37.540 region:rollup2
THROUGH NOT GRADUATING BE HAVING

01:04:35.772 --> 01:04:39.109 region:rollup2
TO WORK A LOT MORE SO. YOU KNOW

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:40.477 region:rollup2
I'M OUR CHAIRS HERE TOO SO WE

01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:41.077 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T HAD THAT STIRRED DEBATE

01:04:40.477 --> 01:04:42.679 region:rollup2
AMONGST OUR COMMISSIONERS OR

01:04:41.077 --> 01:04:44.214 region:rollup2
ANYTHING BUT. YOU KNOW I THINK

01:04:42.679 --> 01:04:45.749 region:rollup2
WE REALLY I THINK THE THE

01:04:44.214 --> 01:04:46.716 region:rollup2
CLOSING THE DOUGHNUT HOLE IN THE

01:04:45.749 --> 01:04:49.519 region:rollup2
GPA IS REALLY MORE OF A

01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:50.854 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATIONS A STREAMLINING.

01:04:49.519 --> 01:04:52.355 region:rollup2
OF AND IT DOESN'T COST A LOT A

01:04:50.854 --> 01:04:53.656 region:rollup2
IN IT BEING ABLE TO SAY LOOK IF

01:04:52.355 --> 01:04:55.759 region:rollup2
YOU MAKE BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND

01:04:53.656 --> 01:04:58.161 region:rollup2
MEAL BRIDGING THE MIDDLE CLASS

01:04:55.759 --> 01:05:00.363 region:rollup2
SCHOLARSHIP IN INCLUDING. LET'S

01:04:58.161 --> 01:05:02.532 region:rollup2
JUST SAY WE PAINT BUT MAKE

01:05:00.363 --> 01:05:03.166 region:rollup2
BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND.

01:05:02.532 --> 01:05:04.734 region:rollup2
A HUNDRED GO BETWEEN ZERO ONE

01:05:03.166 --> 01:05:05.535 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND YOU WILL

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:06.569 region:rollup2
GET A CALL GOING TOWARD SOME

01:05:05.535 --> 01:05:07.437 region:rollup2
SNOW IN ORDER TO PAY HELP PAY

01:05:06.569 --> 01:05:08.605 region:rollup2
FOR TUITION IT MEANS BEING ABLE

01:05:07.437 --> 01:05:09.773 region:rollup2
TO COMMUNICATE THAT RIGHT NOW.

01:05:08.605 --> 01:05:11.207 region:rollup2
USE A WILL YOU MAKE IT IN A OR

01:05:09.773 --> 01:05:13.777 region:rollup2
B. OR MAYBE A SEPA SI IS WORTH

01:05:11.207 --> 01:05:16.146 region:rollup2
LESS YOU KNOW THIS IS THE CITY'S

01:05:13.777 --> 01:05:17.313 region:rollup2
STUDENTS FOR. CHAVEZ AND OPAL

01:05:16.146 --> 01:05:19.416 region:rollup2
THIS IS THAT WE WORRIED LESS

01:05:17.313 --> 01:05:20.750 region:rollup2
THEN OF ME YOU KNOW A STUDENT

01:05:19.416 --> 01:05:22.719 region:rollup2
THAT'S JUST GOING TO COMMITTEE

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:23.286 region:rollup2
BECAUSE TO GO FOR AN A A DEGREE

01:05:22.719 --> 01:05:24.320 region:rollup2
FOR INSTANCE AND SO THERE'S

01:05:23.286 --> 01:05:26.890 region:rollup2
JUST.

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:30.293 region:rollup2
THESE SORT OF. UNEXPLAINED SORT

01:05:26.890 --> 01:05:31.561 region:rollup2
OF REASONS FOR WHY A STUDENT YOU

01:05:30.293 --> 01:05:33.329 region:rollup2
KNOW CITY STUDENTS OR FOR SOME

01:05:31.561 --> 01:05:36.199 region:rollup2
REASON GETS A THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:05:33.329 --> 01:05:38.568 region:rollup2
VERSUS THE SIXTEEN HUNDRED. FOR

01:05:36.199 --> 01:05:40.403 region:rollup2
THE SAME SORT OF YOU KNOW OF

01:05:38.568 --> 01:05:41.304 region:rollup2
BEING ABLE TO AFFORD THE DID A

01:05:40.403 --> 01:05:43.807 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT AGREE THAT'S TRYING TO

01:05:41.304 --> 01:05:46.409 region:rollup2
ATTAIN SO AND THE MIDDLE CLASS

01:05:43.807 --> 01:05:48.044 region:rollup2
STUDENT GETS UP. A PITTANCE BUT

01:05:46.409 --> 01:05:50.180 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE AT THE

01:05:48.044 --> 01:05:52.182 region:rollup2
HIGHER AND.

01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:54.484 region:rollup2
AND IT'S A LAST DOLLAR AND THEY

01:05:52.182 --> 01:05:56.252 region:rollup2
GET LIKE TOWARDS THE END SO. I

01:05:54.484 --> 01:05:58.054 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW PART OF THE REASON THAT

01:05:56.252 --> 01:05:59.422 region:rollup2
WE WENT INTO WANTED TO

01:05:58.054 --> 01:06:04.260 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATE AND STREAMLINES THE

01:05:59.422 --> 01:06:05.361 region:rollup2
PALPITA COMMUNICATE WHAT A

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:05.929 region:rollup2
FAMILY COULD GET.

01:06:05.361 --> 01:06:07.297 region:rollup2
A AND AFFORD AND WHAT THEY

01:06:05.929 --> 01:06:07.897 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE STAVING FOR RIGHT OF

01:06:07.297 --> 01:06:08.565 region:rollup2
BUT THE SAME TIME.

01:06:07.897 --> 01:06:09.666 region:rollup2
KEEPING TO TUITION AND FEES IS

01:06:08.565 --> 01:06:10.266 region:rollup2
NOT HELPING.

01:06:09.666 --> 01:06:11.468 region:rollup2
STUDENTS AND YOU KNOW MAKE IT

01:06:10.266 --> 01:06:12.802 region:rollup2
THROUGH THEIR COLLEGE EXPERIENCE

01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:13.870 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFULLY SO.

01:06:12.802 --> 01:06:14.804 region:rollup2
I'M IN A PUNT OVER TOWARD

01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:15.638 region:rollup2
CHERISHES ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:16.239 region:rollup2
TO ADD.

01:06:15.638 --> 01:06:17.207 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT'S A REALLY HARD

01:06:16.239 --> 01:06:18.308 region:rollup2
QUESTION AND I THINK IF I WERE.

01:06:17.207 --> 01:06:19.309 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IF IF THE COMMISSION

01:06:18.308 --> 01:06:19.909 region:rollup2
WERE DISCUSSING AT MY WORD WE

01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:20.510 region:rollup2
WERE TO PUT THAT QUESTION IN

01:06:19.909 --> 01:06:21.110 region:rollup2
FRONT OF THEM THEY'D PROBABLY

01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:22.011 region:rollup2
LOOK AT ME AND SAY IT'S LIKE.

01:06:21.110 --> 01:06:23.680 region:rollup2
CHOOSING BETWEEN WHICH OF YOUR

01:06:22.011 --> 01:06:25.481 region:rollup2
TWO CHILDREN IS YOUR FAVORITE.

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:27.617 region:rollup2
RIGHT ARM ANY AT THE END OF THE

01:06:25.481 --> 01:06:29.118 region:rollup2
DAY WE BOTH WANT TO ENSURE THAT

01:06:27.617 --> 01:06:30.687 region:rollup2
WE GUARANTEE ACCESS IN THAT WE

01:06:29.118 --> 01:06:32.055 region:rollup2
HAVE AS MANY STUDENTS BE ABLE TO

01:06:30.687 --> 01:06:33.289 region:rollup2
GET INTO COLLEGE AND GO TO

01:06:32.055 --> 01:06:34.090 region:rollup2
COLLEGE AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:06:33.289 --> 01:06:35.758 region:rollup2
THAT THOSE STUDENTS WHO WERE

01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:37.427 region:rollup2
THERE. ARE ACTUALLY SUPPLIED

01:06:35.758 --> 01:06:38.595 region:rollup2
WITH ADEQUATE RESOURCES SO

01:06:37.427 --> 01:06:39.762 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT LIVING IN THEIR CARS

01:06:38.595 --> 01:06:41.564 region:rollup2
AND SO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO FOOD

01:06:39.762 --> 01:06:42.866 region:rollup2
PANTRIES AND SO THAT. THEY HAVE

01:06:41.564 --> 01:06:44.400 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY THE RESOURCES SO THAT

01:06:42.866 --> 01:06:46.169 region:rollup2
THEY CAN ACTUALLY STUDY AND

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:47.971 region:rollup2
MOVED THROUGH IN A TIMELY WAY.

01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:48.938 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S SOME ARGUMENT TO BE

01:06:47.971 --> 01:06:50.740 region:rollup2
MADE THAT THE BARRIERS THAT

01:06:48.938 --> 01:06:51.541 region:rollup2
STUDENTS EXPERIENCE ONCE THEY'RE

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:53.243 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY IN COLLEGE.

01:06:51.541 --> 01:06:54.177 region:rollup2
COULD BE SLOWING THEM DOWN SO

01:06:53.243 --> 01:06:55.111 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY

01:06:54.177 --> 01:06:57.113 region:rollup2
GETTING THROUGH IN ITS TIMELY

01:06:55.111 --> 01:06:58.915 region:rollup2
FASHION AND THEN THAT IS ACOSTA

01:06:57.113 --> 01:07:00.817 region:rollup2
NOT JUST THE INSTITUTIONS NOT

01:06:58.915 --> 01:07:02.151 region:rollup2
JUST IT BUT ALSO TO THE STATE.

01:07:00.817 --> 01:07:03.686 region:rollup2
SO I DON'T KNOW THAT AND YOU

01:07:02.151 --> 01:07:05.054 region:rollup2
KNOW WE CAN MAKE A DECISION

01:07:03.686 --> 01:07:06.356 region:rollup2
BETWEEN YOU KNOW THAT THE

01:07:05.054 --> 01:07:07.156 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WITH THE DONOR WHOLE

01:07:06.356 --> 01:07:08.391 region:rollup2
VERSES YOU KNOW GIVING A LITTLE

01:07:07.156 --> 01:07:10.493 region:rollup2
BIT MORE.

01:07:08.391 --> 01:07:11.628 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S YOU KNOW THEY'RE

01:07:10.493 --> 01:07:12.896 region:rollup2
THEY'RE BOTH IMPORTANT

01:07:11.628 --> 01:07:14.330 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES BOTH FOR THIS FOR

01:07:12.896 --> 01:07:15.732 region:rollup2
THAT FOR OF THE INSTITUTIONS FOR

01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:20.203 region:rollup2
STUDENTS FOR FAMILIES AND FOR

01:07:15.732 --> 01:07:24.140 region:rollup2
THE STATE.

01:07:20.203 --> 01:07:25.708 region:rollup2
JEFF JARVIS.

01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:26.943 region:rollup2
WHY LOOK AT FOUR DID THIS

01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:29.112 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION I THINK IT'S A? VERY

01:07:26.943 --> 01:07:30.880 region:rollup2
GOOD.

01:07:29.112 --> 01:07:31.481 region:rollup2
TAKEN ABACK AS WE STARTED THIS

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.815 region:rollup2
AS YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN ARE SIX

01:07:31.481 --> 01:07:33.416 region:rollup2
YEARS.

01:07:32.815 --> 01:07:34.817 region:rollup2
WELL WAS FIVE YEARS AGO WE'RE

01:07:33.416 --> 01:07:38.087 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT.

01:07:34.817 --> 01:07:39.088 region:rollup2
DEBT FREE COLLEGE FOR STUDENTS.

01:07:38.087 --> 01:07:40.823 region:rollup2
YOUNG WE LOOKED THE COSTA

01:07:39.088 --> 01:07:42.325 region:rollup2
COLLEGE WELL LIKE DEAD FRAME

01:07:40.823 --> 01:07:43.026 region:rollup2
THIS IN SOME OF THE HEARING YOU

01:07:42.325 --> 01:07:44.761 region:rollup2
HAD EARLIER.

01:07:43.026 --> 01:07:46.296 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE FIRST OBJECTIVES WE

01:07:44.761 --> 01:07:49.432 region:rollup2
ESTABLISH.

01:07:46.296 --> 01:07:50.566 region:rollup2
ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO WAS TO

01:07:49.432 --> 01:07:52.035 region:rollup2
MAKE THE COLLEGES MORE EFFECTIVE

01:07:50.566 --> 01:07:53.403 region:rollup2
IN.

01:07:52.035 --> 01:07:55.071 region:rollup2
TRY TO GET STUDENTS WHO ARE

01:07:53.403 --> 01:07:56.039 region:rollup2
TAKEN SIX AND SEVEN YEARS TO GET

01:07:55.071 --> 01:07:57.540 region:rollup2
OUT OF COLLEGE TO GET ON FOR

01:07:56.039 --> 01:07:58.975 region:rollup2
YEARS.

01:07:57.540 --> 01:08:00.343 region:rollup2
AND THAT WAS THE ISSUE WAS THE

01:07:58.975 --> 01:08:03.279 region:rollup2
TRANSFER RATE FROM COMMUNITY

01:08:00.343 --> 01:08:04.814 region:rollup2
COLLEGES DESY ISSUES. THAT THE

01:08:03.279 --> 01:08:06.816 region:rollup2
C. ISSUES OF RECOGNIZE THE

01:08:04.814 --> 01:08:08.484 region:rollup2
CLASSES TAKEN THAT OTHERS SEE

01:08:06.816 --> 01:08:10.586 region:rollup2
ISSUES WOULD SAY OH OUR ENGLISH

01:08:08.484 --> 01:08:11.721 region:rollup2
CLASS BETTER YOURS SO YOU HAVE

01:08:10.586 --> 01:08:13.356 region:rollup2
TO TAKE IT OVER AGAIN.

01:08:11.721 --> 01:08:14.991 region:rollup2
SO'S WE START LOOKING ALL

01:08:13.356 --> 01:08:16.159 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCIES AND.

01:08:14.991 --> 01:08:18.161 region:rollup2
AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY I THINK

01:08:16.159 --> 01:08:19.963 region:rollup2
WE'D LIKE LAST REFORM WOULD

01:08:18.161 --> 01:08:20.863 region:rollup2
PROBABLY CUT A YEAR OFF WHO SAID

01:08:19.963 --> 01:08:22.198 region:rollup2
A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

01:08:20.863 --> 01:08:24.334 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THING WE DID WAS WE

01:08:22.198 --> 01:08:25.535 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE THAT. MANY STUDENTS

01:08:24.334 --> 01:08:27.070 region:rollup2
GOING TO COLLEGE WILL PREPARE

01:08:25.535 --> 01:08:29.038 region:rollup2
FOR COLLEGE.

01:08:27.070 --> 01:08:30.073 region:rollup2
IT IS BECAUSE LIKE CHILDREN

01:08:29.038 --> 01:08:32.275 region:rollup2
STUDENTS HAD TO TAKE REMEDIAL

01:08:30.073 --> 01:08:34.143 region:rollup2
CLASSES WHICH TOOK A MORE TIME

01:08:32.275 --> 01:08:36.245 region:rollup2
AT THE. KEY MANY COLLEGES ARE

01:08:34.143 --> 01:08:36.412 region:rollup2
SEE ISSUES BUT DIDN'T ALLOW THEM

01:08:36.245 --> 01:08:39.015 region:rollup2
TO.

01:08:36.412 --> 01:08:40.183 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

01:08:39.015 --> 01:08:41.551 region:rollup2

AND SO DO ELSIE HAVE EL CAP.

01:08:45.488 --> 01:08:49.192 region:rollup2
ALWAYS SEEN THEM BETTER RESULTS

01:08:47.490 --> 01:08:50.860 region:rollup2
DENIES HAPPY TO SAY THE OTHER

01:08:49.192 --> 01:08:51.628 region:rollup2
DAY WE HAD A HEARING.

01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:53.196 region:rollup2
THE PRESS NEVER WRITES ABOUT

01:08:51.628 --> 01:08:54.731 region:rollup2

FORTY NINE SO I THINK ARE WE

01:09:02.005 --> 01:09:04.641 region:rollup2
GOING THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:05.808 region:rollup2

01:10:55.051 --> 01:10:58.521 region:rollup2
AND THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT

01:10:56.786 --> 01:11:00.022 region:rollup2
THAT'S AVAILABLE TO THEM THAT

01:10:58.521 --> 01:11:01.224 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT JUST THE OTHER DAY THAT

01:11:00.022 --> 01:11:03.593 region:rollup2
THERE ARE PROGRAMS THAT THEY GO

01:11:01.224 --> 01:11:05.294 region:rollup2
TO THAT IT NOT ABOUT TAKING MORE

01:11:03.593 --> 01:11:06.496 region:rollup2
HISTORY CLASSES YOUR LITERATURE.

01:11:05.294 --> 01:11:08.464 region:rollup2
LITERATURE CLASSES SO THAT THE

01:11:06.496 --> 01:11:10.533 region:rollup2
INFORMATION THAT STUDENTS THAT

01:11:08.464 --> 01:11:11.134 region:rollup2
PROTEST THESE POTENTIAL STUDENTS

01:11:10.533 --> 01:11:13.236 region:rollup2
SHOULD GET.

01:11:11.134 --> 01:11:14.837 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO INCLUDE THOSE KINDS OF

01:11:13.236 --> 01:11:15.404 region:rollup2
OPTIONS

01:11:14.837 --> 01:11:17.173 region:rollup2
VERY FEW HUNDRED PERCENT AND

01:11:15.404 --> 01:11:18.141 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING I THINK.

01:11:17.173 --> 01:11:19.041 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNICABLE GEN I'M HAPPY

01:11:18.141 --> 01:11:21.711 region:rollup2
TO SAY A LOT OF THE TRADE UNIONS

01:11:19.041 --> 01:11:23.346 region:rollup2
ARE PART IN WITH US. FOR THOSE

01:11:21.711 --> 01:11:24.547 region:rollup2
APPRENTICESHIPS AND ADJOURNMENTS

01:11:23.346 --> 01:11:26.315 region:rollup2
JOB AND I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL.

01:11:24.547 --> 01:11:28.151 region:rollup2
THE. YOU MAY KNOW THE COMMENT

01:11:26.315 --> 01:11:30.419 region:rollup2
THAT YOU SAID.

01:11:28.151 --> 01:11:31.821 region:rollup2
OF REGARDLESS A GPA.

01:11:30.419 --> 01:11:33.789 region:rollup2
CAN YOU EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT

01:11:31.821 --> 01:11:36.726 region:rollup2
MORE SURE SO I'M.

01:11:33.789 --> 01:11:39.462 region:rollup2
WE HEARD FROM A LOT OF.

01:11:36.726 --> 01:11:41.564 region:rollup2
ASK FOLKS IN K. TWELVE AND THE

01:11:39.462 --> 01:11:43.132 region:rollup2
COLLEGES AND THE CALIFORNIA

01:11:41.564 --> 01:11:46.068 region:rollup2
STUDENT HATE COMMISSION ABOUT A

01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:47.937 region:rollup2
LOT OF EFFORTS TO MATCH DATA ON

01:11:46.068 --> 01:11:49.539 region:rollup2
GPAS BECAUSE OF THE GPA

01:11:47.937 --> 01:11:51.807 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS AND THE CAL GRANT

01:11:49.539 --> 01:11:53.743 region:rollup2
AND IT SEEMED THAT ULTIMATELY.

01:11:51.807 --> 01:11:55.311 region:rollup2
THOSE WERE NOT ALL OF THAT

01:11:53.743 --> 01:11:57.747 region:rollup2
EFFORT WAS NOT ACTUALLY

01:11:55.311 --> 01:12:00.550 region:rollup2
RESULTING AND ANY.

01:11:57.747 --> 01:12:03.786 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT UP FOR THE.

01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:06.289 region:rollup2
FOR THE SYSTEM OVERALL BECAUSE

01:12:03.786 --> 01:12:08.324 region:rollup2
UC AND CSU IN ADMITTING STUDENTS

01:12:06.289 --> 01:12:08.758 region:rollup2
IN THE FIRST PLACE ARE LOOKING

01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:11.294 region:rollup2
AT.

01:12:08.758 --> 01:12:14.797 region:rollup2
AT GPAS AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY

01:12:11.294 --> 01:12:16.999 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT GPAS AN A MORE ROBUST

01:12:14.797 --> 01:12:18.267 region:rollup2
AND SOPHISTICATED WAY THEN YOU

01:12:16.999 --> 01:12:19.702 region:rollup2
KNOW THEY'LL PAY TAKING INTO

01:12:18.267 --> 01:12:21.504 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION QUESTIONS OF WHAT

01:12:19.702 --> 01:12:22.905 region:rollup2
COURSES ARE AVAILABLE AT THE

01:12:21.504 --> 01:12:26.008 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS AND ARE THEY TAKING A

01:12:22.905 --> 01:12:28.744 region:rollup2
PEE AND I'D BE. AND SO IT SEEMED

01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:29.445 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY THAT THE GPA

01:12:28.744 --> 01:12:30.880 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS.

01:12:29.445 --> 01:12:32.315 region:rollup2
ARE CREATING MORE ADMINISTRATIVE

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:34.717 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS

01:12:32.315 --> 01:12:37.753 region:rollup2
THEN THEY ARE WORTH.

01:12:34.717 --> 01:12:40.590 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE HAVE OTHER SYSTEMS

01:12:37.753 --> 01:12:42.024 region:rollup2
IN PLACE ON THE ADMISSION SIDE

01:12:40.590 --> 01:12:44.327 region:rollup2
AND ON THE.

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:46.762 region:rollup2
STATUS ON THE AND AND IN TERMS

01:12:44.327 --> 01:12:50.132 region:rollup2
OF WHETHER STUDENTS ARE.

01:12:46.762 --> 01:12:51.767 region:rollup2
ARE BAD PROGRESSING PUTS ON A

01:12:50.132 --> 01:12:52.835 region:rollup2
SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS

01:12:51.767 --> 01:12:54.170 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE AT THE COMMUNITY

01:12:52.835 --> 01:12:54.770 region:rollup2
COLLEGES.

01:12:54.170 --> 01:12:55.872 region:rollup2
SO YOU WOULDN'T WANT SOMEBODY

01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:57.974 region:rollup2
WHO'S.

01:12:55.872 --> 01:12:59.041 region:rollup2
EIGHT YEARS OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL

01:12:57.974 --> 01:13:01.277 region:rollup2
WHO DECIDES TO GO TO THE

01:12:59.041 --> 01:13:02.745 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND LIKE

01:13:01.277 --> 01:13:04.480 region:rollup2
THEY'VE TOTALLY TURN THEIR LIFE

01:13:02.745 --> 01:13:05.982 region:rollup2
AROUND AND SUDDENLY THERE HIGH

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:06.949 region:rollup2
SCHOOL GPA OF PREVENTINGTHEM

01:13:05.982 --> 01:13:09.852 region:rollup2
FROM GETTING.

01:13:06.949 --> 01:13:11.020 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AID INSTEAD THE

01:13:09.852 --> 01:13:12.455 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE THEY COME THE

01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:14.590 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE COLLEGE THAT PLACEMENT

01:13:12.455 --> 01:13:17.860 region:rollup2
TASTES PLOT TESTS PUT THEM WHERE

01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:19.262 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY NEED TO BE. AND THE

01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:20.496 region:rollup2
QUESTION SHOULD BE ARE THEY

01:13:19.262 --> 01:13:22.298 region:rollup2
MAKING PROGRESS AT THE COMMUNITY

01:13:20.496 --> 01:13:24.834 region:rollup2
COLLEGE AND THAT THOSE SYSTEMS

01:13:22.298 --> 01:13:27.303 region:rollup2
THAT ARE IN PLACE ARE BETTER

01:13:24.834 --> 01:13:28.537 region:rollup2
THAN THAT SORT OF THE STRICT CUT

01:13:27.303 --> 01:13:29.839 region:rollup2
OFF THAT WE GOT IN THE STATUTE

01:13:28.537 --> 01:13:30.773 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW.

01:13:29.839 --> 01:13:31.874 region:rollup2
I'M GLAD YOU CLARIFIED THAT

01:13:30.773 --> 01:13:33.643 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I'M TALKING MANY.

01:13:31.874 --> 01:13:35.478 region:rollup2
.

01:13:33.643 --> 01:13:37.380 region:rollup2
YOU SEE PRESIDENT SOON SEE

01:13:35.478 --> 01:13:39.048 region:rollup2
ISSUES THEY ARE A LOOK AT THE

01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:40.983 region:rollup2
WHOLE STUDENT THEY'RE NOT THEIR

01:13:39.048 --> 01:13:41.550 region:rollup2
LOOK AND ACT DAM WE SOCIALIZE

01:13:40.983 --> 01:13:43.019 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'VE GONE

01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:44.887 region:rollup2
THROUGH SO. I JUST WANT TO

01:13:43.019 --> 01:13:46.989 region:rollup2
CLARIFY THE GPAS YOU BECAUSE IF

01:13:44.887 --> 01:13:47.523 region:rollup2
YOU LOOK AT THE LOG CHART TO BE

01:13:46.989 --> 01:13:50.826 region:rollup2
PASSED OUT HERE.

01:13:47.523 --> 01:13:52.328 region:rollup2
THAT WAS DONE BY THE UC'S.

01:13:50.826 --> 01:13:52.995 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW JUST RANSOM SULFUR GPA

01:13:52.328 --> 01:13:56.232 region:rollup2
INFLUENCED

01:13:52.995 --> 01:13:57.400 region:rollup2
SO.

01:13:56.232 --> 01:13:59.468 region:rollup2
THIS IS SO HERE'S HERE'S WHY

01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:00.102 region:rollup2
LEGIT TO.

01:13:59.468 --> 01:14:02.872 region:rollup2
WHERE I'M GOING WITH THIS NOW?

01:14:00.102 --> 01:14:04.206 region:rollup2
?

01:14:02.872 --> 01:14:05.775 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE THE COW GRASS SEED TO

01:14:04.206 --> 01:14:08.311 region:rollup2
BE LOOKED AT BUT I'M WONDERING.

01:14:05.775 --> 01:14:10.179 region:rollup2
HOW WE TRYING TO DESIGN?

01:14:08.311 --> 01:14:12.715 region:rollup2
THEY FUNDING SYSTEM.

01:14:10.179 --> 01:14:15.685 region:rollup2
THAT SUPPORTS THREE DIFFERENT.

01:14:12.715 --> 01:14:17.687 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS.

01:14:15.685 --> 01:14:19.221 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

01:14:17.687 --> 01:14:21.390 region:rollup2
THE WONDERFUL JOB WE TALKED

01:14:19.221 --> 01:14:22.858 region:rollup2
ABOUT TRADES AND GOING IN AND.

01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:25.861 region:rollup2
MAYBE THEY ARE TRANSFERRING OUT

01:14:22.858 --> 01:14:26.996 region:rollup2
TO CSU UC VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE

01:14:25.861 --> 01:14:27.563 region:rollup2
MORE FROM OUR.

01:14:26.996 --> 01:14:29.699 region:rollup2
BEING RETRAIN FOR SKILLS IN

01:14:27.563 --> 01:14:32.335 region:rollup2
JOBS.

01:14:29.699 --> 01:14:35.338 region:rollup2
THE UC'S I DON'T THINK WE GIVE

01:14:32.335 --> 01:14:37.073 region:rollup2
ENOUGH CREDIT ON. REALLY THEIR

01:14:35.338 --> 01:14:39.342 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC INNOVATION HUBS FOR

01:14:37.073 --> 01:14:41.344 region:rollup2
REGIONS IN THE STATE.

01:14:39.342 --> 01:14:43.045 region:rollup2
AND YOU LOOK AT WITH AN UC'S.

01:14:41.344 --> 01:14:44.780 region:rollup2
IN I BRAG ABOUT ARE YOU SEE THE

01:14:43.045 --> 01:14:46.115 region:rollup2
TOP TEN UNIVERSITIES.

01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:47.516 region:rollup2
IN THE NATION YOU CAN LOOK AT

01:14:46.115 --> 01:14:49.752 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALWAYS TWO OR THREE OF

01:14:47.516 --> 01:14:51.087 region:rollup2
OUR UC'S AND. SO WHEN PEOPLE SAY

01:14:49.752 --> 01:14:53.622 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA'S GOING DOWN

01:14:51.087 --> 01:14:54.223 region:rollup2
A SINKHOLE AND AGAIN I DON'T

01:14:53.622 --> 01:14:54.857 region:rollup2
KNOW UC'S LOOK PRETTY GOOD TO

01:14:54.223 --> 01:14:56.359 region:rollup2
ME.

01:14:54.857 --> 01:14:58.427 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE C. S. USE.

01:14:56.359 --> 01:15:06.502 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:14:58.427 --> 01:15:08.204 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUS.

01:15:06.502 --> 01:15:10.573 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC.

01:15:08.204 --> 01:15:12.108 region:rollup2
PDAS AND GOING.

01:15:10.573 --> 01:15:13.409 region:rollup2
THEY'VE GOT SUCH A GREAT JOB TO

01:15:12.108 --> 01:15:15.211 region:rollup2
DEVELOP THE ECONOMY OF NORTH

01:15:13.409 --> 01:15:16.379 region:rollup2
COUNTY SAN DIEGO.

01:15:15.211 --> 01:15:18.080 region:rollup2
SO BUT THEY THEY'RE DIFFERENT

01:15:16.379 --> 01:15:19.115 region:rollup2
PEOPLE.

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:20.983 region:rollup2
NOT LIKE A BETTER PEOPLE IT'S

01:15:19.115 --> 01:15:21.584 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

01:15:20.983 --> 01:15:23.819 region:rollup2
SO THEY ALL HAVE AN IMPORTANT

01:15:21.584 --> 01:15:25.121 region:rollup2
ROLE.

01:15:23.819 --> 01:15:27.089 region:rollup2
BACK TO MY QUESTION ARE WE

01:15:25.121 --> 01:15:29.058 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING.

01:15:27.089 --> 01:15:30.659 region:rollup2
FUNDING SYSTEM A TRY TO.

01:15:29.058 --> 01:15:31.627 region:rollup2
GET TOGETHER FUNNY SYSTEM THAT'S

01:15:30.659 --> 01:15:33.095 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY WORK IN THREE DIFFERENT

01:15:31.627 --> 01:15:35.097 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTS.

01:15:33.095 --> 01:15:35.731 region:rollup2
AND JUSTICE LA SLASH THOUGHT I

01:15:35.097 --> 01:15:36.932 region:rollup2
THINK THIS YEAR'S YOU TOUCHED ON

01:15:35.731 --> 01:15:38.401 region:rollup2
IT.

01:15:36.932 --> 01:15:39.802 region:rollup2
IT WASN'T LAST WEEK THERE IN

01:15:38.401 --> 01:15:42.004 region:rollup2
HERE ASKING FOR A HUNDRED

01:15:39.802 --> 01:15:43.406 region:rollup2
SEVENTY MILLION DOLLAR PLUS.

01:15:42.004 --> 01:15:44.206 region:rollup2
IN A LOT OF US SAID HEY WE'RE

01:15:43.406 --> 01:15:46.809 region:rollup2
ALL ABOARD.

01:15:44.206 --> 01:15:47.910 region:rollup2
.

01:15:46.809 --> 01:15:49.412 region:rollup2
WOULD TO SEE ISSUES LIKE I SAID

01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:51.347 region:rollup2
BACK OFF THAT HUNDRED SEVENTY

01:15:49.412 --> 01:15:52.848 region:rollup2
ONE MILLION PLUS UP. TO BEEF

01:15:51.347 --> 01:15:54.316 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THE TERM WE USE IN FULLY

01:15:52.848 --> 01:15:55.818 region:rollup2
FUNDED SEE ISSUES.

01:15:54.316 --> 01:15:58.020 region:rollup2
AT AT THE EXPENSE OF THIS.

01:15:55.818 --> 01:16:00.456 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD THINK.

01:15:58.020 --> 01:16:03.325 region:rollup2
PROBABLY NOT.

01:16:00.456 --> 01:16:04.326 region:rollup2
AND SO IT'S ACCURATE SURPRISE

01:16:03.325 --> 01:16:05.528 region:rollup2
WHEN I'M DOWN DUE TO MOVE AHEAD

01:16:04.326 --> 01:16:08.030 region:rollup2
NO COVERAGE YOU'RE YOU'RE BETTER

01:16:05.528 --> 01:16:09.832 region:rollup2
POLITICIAN THAN I AM SO THE.

01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:10.966 region:rollup2
SO I I THINK WE. I LIKED A

01:16:09.832 --> 01:16:12.234 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION OF THE GETS GO BUT I

01:16:10.966 --> 01:16:13.469 region:rollup2
I'M JUST TRYING TO BRING SOME

01:16:12.234 --> 01:16:14.036 region:rollup2
ROUTE REALITY.

01:16:13.469 --> 01:16:16.205 region:rollup2
WE NOTICED WE HAD A PROBLEM

01:16:14.036 --> 01:16:17.740 region:rollup2
WITH.

01:16:16.205 --> 01:16:18.741 region:rollup2
COSTA DEBT FOR EDUCATION FOR

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:20.943 region:rollup2
CHILDREN WAS TOO MUCH.

01:16:18.741 --> 01:16:22.311 region:rollup2
WE HAD TO DO SOMETHING.

01:16:20.943 --> 01:16:24.480 region:rollup2
WE LOOKED EFFICIENCIES OF THE

01:16:22.311 --> 01:16:25.714 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS WE LOOKED AT PREPARING A

01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:27.216 region:rollup2
BETTER STUDENTS AND I'M VERY

01:16:25.714 --> 01:16:29.351 region:rollup2
PROUD OF ALL AYE TEACHES AYE.

01:16:27.216 --> 01:16:30.286 region:rollup2
KATIE TWELVE AN EARLY EDUCATION

01:16:29.351 --> 01:16:33.222 region:rollup2

GOOD STUFF LIKE THAT AND I'M

01:16:33.789 --> 01:16:36.859 region:rollup2
JUST.

01:16:34.256 --> 01:16:38.060 region:rollup2
WONDERING IF.

01:16:36.859 --> 01:16:40.463 region:rollup2
THERE'S SOME REALITY THIS WHEN

01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:42.865 region:rollup2
YOU LOOK AT ON ONE FUNDED SYSTEM

01:16:40.463 --> 01:16:44.133 region:rollup2
FOR THREE DIFFERENT WORLDS.

01:16:42.865 --> 01:16:45.501 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATE IS QUICKLY ANSWERS

TO A CD TRACK.

01:16:56.679 --> 01:16:59.548 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ARGUE HERE

01:16:57.913 --> 01:17:01.183 region:rollup2
IS THAT ALL THREE OF THOSE COME

01:16:59.548 --> 01:17:02.585 region:rollup2
FROM A VERY LOW INCOME FAMILY?

01:17:01.183 --> 01:17:03.819 region:rollup2

GOING TO BE PAID. RIGHT.

01:17:08.057 --> 01:17:11.527 region:rollup2
IN SOME WAY GOING TO BE FINANCED

01:17:10.025 --> 01:17:13.028 region:rollup2
THEIR COST OF ATTENDANCE.

01:17:11.527 --> 01:17:14.130 region:rollup2
MAY NOT BE FINANCE IN THE SAME

01:17:13.028 --> 01:17:15.664 region:rollup2
WAY AT ALL THREE OF THOSE

01:17:14.130 --> 01:17:18.033 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS.

01:17:15.664 --> 01:17:19.568 region:rollup2
SAME FAMILY SAME NEED IN FACT

01:17:18.033 --> 01:17:20.903 region:rollup2
THAT WAS CAMINO CONSTANT THAT

01:17:19.568 --> 01:17:22.371 region:rollup2
HAS A CT.

01:17:20.903 --> 01:17:23.405 region:rollup2
UP UNTIL THIS LAST YEAR THEY

01:17:22.371 --> 01:17:24.507 region:rollup2

01:17:23.405 --> 01:17:25.908 region:rollup2

01:17:30.346 --> 01:17:33.215 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN SAUDI SO WE'VE DECIDED

01:17:32.148 --> 01:17:34.984 region:rollup2
THAT THE STATE THAT THEY'RE

01:17:33.215 --> 01:17:36.018 region:rollup2
WORTH LESS.

01:17:34.984 --> 01:17:37.586 region:rollup2
FOR GOING TO GET A CT

01:17:36.018 --> 01:17:39.355 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATE. AND THEY HAVE THE

01:17:37.586 --> 01:17:40.456 region:rollup2
SAME FINANCIALLY SO THAT'S WHAT

01:17:39.355 --> 01:17:41.724 region:rollup2
WE'RE TRYING TO GET AT THAT

01:17:40.456 --> 01:17:42.758 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF THE CHOICE THAT

01:17:41.724 --> 01:17:44.393 region:rollup2

01:17:47.863 --> 01:17:51.200 region:rollup2
ATTENDANCE THAT MAY OR MAY NOT

01:17:49.899 --> 01:17:52.334 region:rollup2
BE FULFILL DEPENDING ON WHICH

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:53.335 region:rollup2
SEGMENT YOU CHOOSE.

01:17:52.334 --> 01:17:54.370 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:17:53.335 --> 01:17:57.439 region:rollup2
GET. THAT'S WHAT THIS

01:17:54.370 --> 01:17:59.808 region:rollup2
HEARINGS ABOUT.

01:17:57.439 --> 01:18:01.210 region:rollup2

PACIFIC UNIVERSITY MAKES A GOOD

01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:39.888 region:rollup2
FAITH EFFORT THEY INCREASED THE

01:32:37.452 --> 01:32:41.656 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF EDTA IS. THE SYSTEM

01:32:39.888 --> 01:32:43.425 region:rollup2

01:32:48.730 --> 01:32:52.967 region:rollup2

01:33:27.802 --> 01:33:31.706 region:rollup2
AWARE THAT THE TRANSFER PATHWAYS

01:33:30.004 --> 01:33:33.174 region:rollup2
ACCESSIBLE TO THEM.

01:33:31.706 --> 01:33:34.676 region:rollup2
YOU CAN ALSO GO FURTHER AND HAVE

01:33:33.174 --> 01:33:36.811 region:rollup2
A I SEE SEE YOU REPORT BACK A

01:33:34.676 --> 01:33:37.779 region:rollup2
YEAR FROM NOW ON HOW MANY

01:33:36.811 --> 01:33:39.214 region:rollup2
TRANSFER STUDENTS DID THEY TAKE

01:33:37.779 --> 01:33:40.682 region:rollup2
HOW MANY EIGHTY T. STUDENTS

01:33:39.214 --> 01:33:41.950 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY DID THEY TAKE.

01:33:40.682 --> 01:33:44.219 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW THE ADMINISTRATION

01:33:41.950 --> 01:33:46.154 region:rollup2
CAN'T TELL YOU THAT INFORMATION

01:33:44.219 --> 01:33:47.388 region:rollup2
SO YOU DON'T HAVE A BASELINE SO

01:33:46.154 --> 01:33:49.324 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T KNOW IF TWENTY FIVE

01:33:47.388 --> 01:33:51.259 region:rollup2
HUNDRED IS A GOOD GOAL OR IF THE

01:33:49.324 --> 01:33:53.261 region:rollup2
A I CC YOU SECTOR IS ALREADY

01:33:51.259 --> 01:33:55.196 region:rollup2
ABOVE THAT GOAL. YOUR AGENDA

01:33:53.261 --> 01:33:56.698 region:rollup2
SPECIFIES THAT I A I SEE SEE YOU

01:33:55.196 --> 01:33:58.299 region:rollup2
TAKES ABOUT NINETY FIVE HUNDRED

01:33:56.698 --> 01:33:59.634 region:rollup2
TRANSFER STUDENTS SIERRA COULD

01:33:58.299 --> 01:34:01.469 region:rollup2
VERY WELL BE THAT TWENTY FIVE

01:33:59.634 --> 01:34:01.736 region:rollup2
HUNDRED OF THEM ARE DO YOU HAVE

01:34:01.469 --> 01:34:03.171 region:rollup2
ANY DUTY.

01:34:01.736 --> 01:34:04.572 region:rollup2
SO YOU COULD AGAIN SIGNAL YOUR

01:34:03.171 --> 01:34:06.241 region:rollup2
INTEREST THAT YOU THINK THIS IS

01:34:04.572 --> 01:34:08.209 region:rollup2
A GOOD IDEA HAVE A I SEE SEE YOU

01:34:06.241 --> 01:34:09.777 region:rollup2
REPORT BACK HOPE THAT YOU DO SEE

01:34:08.209 --> 01:34:11.446 region:rollup2
INCREASES YEAR OVER YEAR FOR THE

01:34:09.777 --> 01:34:12.914 region:rollup2
NEXT FEW YEARS.

01:34:11.446 --> 01:34:14.215 region:rollup2
WE CONTINUE TO THINK IT'S GOOD

01:34:12.914 --> 01:34:15.917 region:rollup2
POLICY THAT AND THE IT'S GOOD

01:34:14.215 --> 01:34:17.719 region:rollup2
PRACTICE THAT THE STATE HAVE A

01:34:15.917 --> 01:34:19.954 region:rollup2
POLICY FOR ESTABLISHING WHAT THE

01:34:17.719 --> 01:34:21.623 region:rollup2
NONPROFIT CAL GRANT SHOULD BE.

01:34:19.954 --> 01:34:24.159 region:rollup2
THE STAY IN YEARS PAST HAS HAD A

01:34:21.623 --> 01:34:25.760 region:rollup2
POLICY NOT JUST FOR WHAT'S AT

01:34:24.159 --> 01:34:27.128 region:rollup2
STAKE FROM GOING FROM AN EIGHT

01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:28.563 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLAR TO NINE THOUSAND

01:34:27.128 --> 01:34:30.431 region:rollup2
DOLLAR WARD BUT WHAT THE WORD

01:34:28.563 --> 01:34:32.233 region:rollup2
ITSELF SHOULD BE WHETHER TO BE

01:34:30.431 --> 01:34:33.635 region:rollup2
NINE THOUSAND.

01:34:32.233 --> 01:34:35.637 region:rollup2
FOR A FRAME OF REFERENCE WE JUST

01:34:33.635 --> 01:34:37.005 region:rollup2
TOOK THE STATE'S PRIOR POLICY

01:34:35.637 --> 01:34:38.606 region:rollup2
TRADITIONALLY THESE POLICIES

01:34:37.005 --> 01:34:40.775 region:rollup2
HAVE TRIED TO THE VALUES STUDENT

01:34:38.606 --> 01:34:42.577 region:rollup2
CHOICE STUDENT ACCESS AND COST

01:34:40.775 --> 01:34:44.379 region:rollup2
NEUTRALITY THAT THE STATE WOULD

01:34:42.577 --> 01:34:45.680 region:rollup2
PAY THE SAME AMOUNT ON BEHALF OF

01:34:44.379 --> 01:34:47.015 region:rollup2
THE LOW INCOME STUDENTS. WHETHER

01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:49.184 region:rollup2
THEY ONCE THE NONPROFIT OR

01:34:47.015 --> 01:34:50.485 region:rollup2
PUBLIC INSTITUTION SO THE FRAME

01:34:49.184 --> 01:34:52.554 region:rollup2
OF REFERENCE WE TOOK THE LAST

01:34:50.485 --> 01:34:53.454 region:rollup2
POLICY THE STATE HAD IN PLACE

01:34:52.554 --> 01:34:54.822 region:rollup2
JUST UPDATED AT.

01:34:53.454 --> 01:34:56.424 region:rollup2
THE RATE WOULD BE SIXTEEN

01:34:54.822 --> 01:34:57.559 region:rollup2
THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS

01:34:56.424 --> 01:34:59.060 region:rollup2
YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO GET THERE

01:34:57.559 --> 01:34:59.861 region:rollup2
OVERNIGHT THAT'S SUBSTANTIALLY

01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:01.029 region:rollup2
HIGHER THAN THE NINE THOUSAND

01:34:59.861 --> 01:35:02.664 region:rollup2
DOLLAR PRE.

01:35:01.029 --> 01:35:04.632 region:rollup2
I AM IF YOU IMPLEMENTED IT OVER

01:35:02.664 --> 01:35:06.701 region:rollup2
A FIVE YEAR PERIOD WITH TWELVE

01:35:04.632 --> 01:35:08.736 region:rollup2
HUNDRED DOLLAR INCREMENTAL AWARD

01:35:06.701 --> 01:35:10.538 region:rollup2
INCREASES IN COSTS ABOUT EIGHT

01:35:08.736 --> 01:35:11.873 region:rollup2
POINT SIX MILLION A YEAR IN

01:35:10.538 --> 01:35:12.507 region:rollup2
TOTAL AFTER THE FIVE YEARS IT

01:35:11.873 --> 01:35:14.609 region:rollup2
BEFORE THE THREE MILLION DOLLARS

01:35:12.507 --> 01:35:15.877 region:rollup2
MARK. SO THAT'S AGAIN JUST A

01:35:14.609 --> 01:35:17.278 region:rollup2
REFERENCE IF YOU DID WANT TO

01:35:15.877 --> 01:35:19.847 region:rollup2
RESURRECT SOME THE OLD POLICIES

01:35:17.278 --> 01:35:20.481 region:rollup2
THE STATE HAD FOR ESTABLISHING

01:35:19.847 --> 01:35:23.084 region:rollup2
WHAT DOES THE WORD LEVEL SHOULD

01:35:20.481 --> 01:35:24.218 region:rollup2
BE.

01:35:23.084 --> 01:35:26.120 region:rollup2
WELL I'M SO SORRY SO THERE IS A

01:35:24.218 --> 01:35:26.688 region:rollup2
WHOLE NOTHER PROPOSAL THAT YOU

01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:27.455 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T TALKED AT ALL ABOUT

01:35:26.688 --> 01:35:29.624 region:rollup2
YEAH.

01:35:27.455 --> 01:35:31.059 region:rollup2
FOUNTAIN I THINK I CAN COVERED

01:35:29.624 --> 01:35:32.193 region:rollup2
AND ONCE YOU MINUTES SO THE

01:35:31.059 --> 01:35:34.229 region:rollup2
OTHER PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S

01:35:32.193 --> 01:35:36.864 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL IS THAT IF YOU'RE WASCO

01:35:34.229 --> 01:35:38.132 region:rollup2
CREDITED FOR PROFIT. YOU WITH

01:35:36.864 --> 01:35:39.534 region:rollup2
THIS YOU WILL LOSE SO YOU WOULD

01:35:38.132 --> 01:35:40.702 region:rollup2
GO FROM NINE THOUSAND TO FOUR

01:35:39.534 --> 01:35:42.337 region:rollup2
THOUSAND THAT LOW INCOME

01:35:40.702 --> 01:35:43.738 region:rollup2
STUDENTS CAL GRANT RECIPIENTS AT

01:35:42.337 --> 01:35:45.907 region:rollup2
THOSE INSTITUTIONS WOULD STEVE A

01:35:43.738 --> 01:35:46.507 region:rollup2
FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR REDUCTION

01:35:45.907 --> 01:35:48.109 region:rollup2
IN THEIR CAL GRANT.

01:35:46.507 --> 01:35:50.044 region:rollup2
THERE'S ONLY FIVE INSTITUTIONS

01:35:48.109 --> 01:35:51.212 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE AFFECTED.

01:35:50.044 --> 01:35:53.314 region:rollup2
WE ASK THE ADMINISTRATION

01:35:51.212 --> 01:35:54.015 region:rollup2
SEVERAL TIMES WHY IT WHY DO THIS

01:35:53.314 --> 01:35:55.783 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THE RATIONALE AND WE

01:35:54.015 --> 01:35:57.352 region:rollup2
DIDN'T GET A PARTICULARLY GOOD

01:35:55.783 --> 01:35:59.087 region:rollup2
ANSWER BUT WE WENT THE EXTRA

01:35:57.352 --> 01:36:00.421 region:rollup2
STEP INSIDE IT ARE THERE REASONS

01:35:59.087 --> 01:36:02.190 region:rollup2
WHY YOU MIGHT BE CONCERNS AND

01:36:00.421 --> 01:36:03.691 region:rollup2
ONCE REDUCE THE AWARD. FROM NINE

01:36:02.190 --> 01:36:05.293 region:rollup2
THOUSAND TO FOUR THOUSAND FOR

01:36:03.691 --> 01:36:06.261 region:rollup2
THESE FIVE.

01:36:05.293 --> 01:36:07.962 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM

01:36:06.261 --> 01:36:09.998 region:rollup2
ALREADY HAS INSTITUTIONAL

01:36:07.962 --> 01:36:10.898 region:rollup2
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA SO THESE

01:36:09.998 --> 01:36:12.200 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS ARE YOU HAVE TO

01:36:10.898 --> 01:36:13.835 region:rollup2
HAVE A GRADUATE OF AT LEAST

01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:15.370 region:rollup2
THIRTY PERCENT AND NO MORE THAN

01:36:13.835 --> 01:36:17.105 region:rollup2
A FIFTEEN POINT FIVE PERCENT

01:36:15.370 --> 01:36:18.373 region:rollup2
STUDENT DEFAULT RATE. THEY MEET

01:36:17.105 --> 01:36:19.674 region:rollup2
THOSE CRITERIA.

01:36:18.373 --> 01:36:21.342 region:rollup2
SO WE WENT FURTHER AND SAID WELL

01:36:19.674 --> 01:36:22.910 region:rollup2
HOW DO THEY STACK UP AGAINST THE

01:36:21.342 --> 01:36:25.013 region:rollup2
NONPROFIT SIN AGAINST YES YOU

01:36:22.910 --> 01:36:26.948 region:rollup2
KNOW. THEIR GROUND RATES ON

01:36:25.013 --> 01:36:28.416 region:rollup2
AVERAGE THESE FIVE INSTITUTIONS

01:36:26.948 --> 01:36:30.952 region:rollup2
ARE LOWER THAN THE NON PROFITS

01:36:28.416 --> 01:36:32.420 region:rollup2
HIGHER THAN CSU SYSTEM WIDE.

01:36:30.952 --> 01:36:34.589 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO STUDENT DEFAULT

01:36:32.420 --> 01:36:36.591 region:rollup2
RATES THEIR HIGHER THAN BOTH NON

01:36:34.589 --> 01:36:38.860 region:rollup2
PROFITS AND CSU BUT BY ONE

01:36:36.591 --> 01:36:40.128 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE POINT ON AVERAGE.

01:36:38.860 --> 01:36:41.763 region:rollup2
SO UNTIL FOLKS CAN HAVE LIKE

01:36:40.128 --> 01:36:43.264 region:rollup2
MEANINGFUL INDICATORS THAT THESE

01:36:41.763 --> 01:36:44.565 region:rollup2
FIVE INSTITUTIONS ARE LOWER

01:36:43.264 --> 01:36:46.167 region:rollup2
QUALITY WE DON'T THINK THERE'S

01:36:44.565 --> 01:36:48.169 region:rollup2
ADEQUATE JUSTIFICATION FOR

01:36:46.167 --> 01:36:52.373 region:rollup2
REDUCING AWARD FOR FINANCIALLY

01:36:48.169 --> 01:36:53.841 region:rollup2
NEEDY STUDENTS ATTENDING THEM.

01:36:52.373 --> 01:36:54.876 region:rollup2
AT I KNOW WEEK WEEK WE CLOSED UP

01:36:53.841 --> 01:36:56.644 region:rollup2
PUBLIC COMMENT BY NO THERE'S

01:36:54.876 --> 01:36:58.880 region:rollup2
THAT REPRESENTS FROM THE PRIVATE

01:36:56.644 --> 01:37:01.182 region:rollup2
FOR PROFIT SO. IF THEY DID WANT

01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:02.483 region:rollup2
TO COMMENT ON THIS PROPOSAL THE

01:37:01.182 --> 01:37:03.384 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WASN'T RIGHT

01:37:02.483 --> 01:37:05.787 region:rollup2
NOT BUT WE WILL.

01:37:03.384 --> 01:37:07.288 region:rollup2
AND ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN.

01:37:05.787 --> 01:37:09.057 region:rollup2
THAT CHAIRMAN IF I MAY GOD CHRIS

01:37:07.288 --> 01:37:09.657 region:rollup2
FERGUSON WITH FINANCE I THINK

01:37:09.057 --> 01:37:11.459 region:rollup2
THE REASON THAT YOU'RE NOT

01:37:09.657 --> 01:37:13.594 region:rollup2
SEEING PLANNING AND SAY THIS AS

01:37:11.459 --> 01:37:14.362 region:rollup2
A PROPOSAL IS. THAT'S EXISTING

01:37:13.594 --> 01:37:16.564 region:rollup2
WALL.

01:37:14.362 --> 01:37:18.099 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE A PROPOSED A CHANGE

01:37:16.564 --> 01:37:20.268 region:rollup2
IN THAT AREA THAT IS WHAT LAW

01:37:18.099 --> 01:37:21.703 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE. UP FOR THE EIGHTEEN

01:37:20.268 --> 01:37:24.605 region:rollup2
NINETEEN FISCAL YEAR FOR THE

01:37:21.703 --> 01:37:25.907 region:rollup2
WALK FOR PROFIT AYE INSTITUTIONS

01:37:24.605 --> 01:37:27.742 region:rollup2
AND I AYE WHERE MAYBE AT A LOSS

01:37:25.907 --> 01:37:30.378 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS WHITE IS X. EXISTING

01:37:27.742 --> 01:37:31.546 region:rollup2
LOCKING YOU. LIGHTNESS THERE'S

01:37:30.378 --> 01:37:32.714 region:rollup2
WHY THIS IS HAPPENING.

01:37:31.546 --> 01:37:34.349 region:rollup2
SEARCHLIGHT WHAT HAPPENED

01:37:32.714 --> 01:37:36.017 region:rollup2
BETWEEN LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR

01:37:34.349 --> 01:37:37.151 region:rollup2
WHICH WHICH MAKES THIS HAPPEN SO

01:37:36.017 --> 01:37:38.886 region:rollup2
TO GIVE YOU A HISTORICAL

01:37:37.151 --> 01:37:40.121 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE AND I BELIEVE THE

01:37:38.886 --> 01:37:41.789 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWELVE BUDGET ACT THERE

01:37:40.121 --> 01:37:43.825 region:rollup2
WAS A SET OF AGREEMENTS MADE IT

01:37:41.789 --> 01:37:45.293 region:rollup2
TO LOWER. AT THE AMOUNT GIVEN TO

01:37:43.825 --> 01:37:46.828 region:rollup2
THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE RESULT

01:37:45.293 --> 01:37:48.396 region:rollup2
OF THE RECESSION AND THOSE

01:37:46.828 --> 01:37:49.964 region:rollup2
DECIDED IN TWENTY TWELVE AND

01:37:48.396 --> 01:37:51.299 region:rollup2
TWENTY FOURTEEN FIFTEEN THE

01:37:49.964 --> 01:37:52.867 region:rollup2
AMOUNT WOULD GO DOWN FROM NINE

01:37:51.299 --> 01:37:53.434 region:rollup2
THOUSAND EIGHT FOUR TWO I

01:37:52.867 --> 01:37:54.202 region:rollup2
BELIEVE EIGHT THOUSAND FIFTY

01:37:53.434 --> 01:37:55.036 region:rollup2
SIX.

01:37:54.202 --> 01:37:56.738 region:rollup2
AND THEN SINCE THE TWENTY

01:37:55.036 --> 01:37:58.005 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN BUDGET ACT EVERY YEAR

01:37:56.738 --> 01:38:00.441 region:rollup2
SINCE THEN.

01:37:58.005 --> 01:38:02.110 region:rollup2
EACH BUDGET ACT HAS SICK PUSHED

01:38:00.441 --> 01:38:05.546 region:rollup2
BACK THAT DECISION.

01:38:02.110 --> 01:38:06.614 region:rollup2
EACH YEAR SUCCESSIVELY AND SO.

01:38:05.546 --> 01:38:07.915 region:rollup2
OUR A FINANCES PERSPECTIVE IN

01:38:06.614 --> 01:38:09.851 region:rollup2
THE ADMINISTRATION'S PERSPECTIVE

01:38:07.915 --> 01:38:11.619 region:rollup2
IS THAT THIS IS A FULFILLMENT OF

01:38:09.851 --> 01:38:14.055 region:rollup2
EXISTING LAW BEING CONSISTENT.

01:38:11.619 --> 01:38:15.123 region:rollup2
YES SO THERE'S FIVE. COLLEGES

01:38:14.055 --> 01:38:16.724 region:rollup2
THAT WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE

01:38:15.123 --> 01:38:18.159 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND.

01:38:16.724 --> 01:38:19.894 region:rollup2
IMPACT OF ALL THIS SO THE

01:38:18.159 --> 01:38:21.162 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET RECOGNIZES

01:38:19.894 --> 01:38:21.662 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED

01:38:21.162 --> 01:38:23.798 region:rollup2
THOUSAND IN GENERAL FUND

01:38:21.662 --> 01:38:25.633 region:rollup2
SAVINGS.

01:38:23.798 --> 01:38:26.400 region:rollup2
A THOUSAND COCA UP UNTIL NOW

01:38:25.633 --> 01:38:28.469 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH THAT WAS THE

01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:30.338 region:rollup2
ARRANGEMENT AND TWELVE THIRTEEN

01:38:28.469 --> 01:38:32.774 region:rollup2
THAT COME FOURTEEN FIFTEEN ALL

01:38:30.338 --> 01:38:34.409 region:rollup2
WASCO CREDITED. PRIVATE SCHOOLS

01:38:32.774 --> 01:38:36.110 region:rollup2
WHETHER THEY BE NONPROFIT OR FOR

01:38:34.409 --> 01:38:37.812 region:rollup2
PROFIT WOULD SEE THEIR ADOPTION

01:38:36.110 --> 01:38:39.347 region:rollup2
THE PROPOSAL THIS YEAR IS TO

01:38:37.812 --> 01:38:40.882 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY TRIGGER AND ALLOW THE

01:38:39.347 --> 01:38:42.583 region:rollup2
REDUCTION TO OCCUR JUST FOR THE

01:38:40.882 --> 01:38:44.185 region:rollup2
FOR PROFITS YARDI HEARD ABOUT

01:38:42.583 --> 01:38:45.620 region:rollup2

INSTEAD OF FINDING TWO SEPARATE

PROGRAMS THAT TARGET THE SAME

01:55:25.752 --> 01:55:28.955 region:rollup2
SOCIO ECONOMIC COHORT AND HAVE

01:55:27.587 --> 01:55:30.357 region:rollup2
DIFFERING REQUIREMENTS THE

01:55:28.955 --> 01:55:32.092 region:rollup2
BUDGET PROPOSES TO CONSOLIDATE

01:55:30.357 --> 01:55:33.527 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAMS.

01:55:32.092 --> 01:55:36.163 region:rollup2
AND CREATE A MORE STREAMLINED

01:55:33.527 --> 01:55:37.230 region:rollup2
AND STUDENTS FOCUSED PROGRAM.

01:55:36.163 --> 01:55:38.932 region:rollup2
UNDER THE PROPOSAL A STUDENTS

01:55:37.230 --> 01:55:39.966 region:rollup2
GRANT AMOUNT WOULD BE BASED ON

01:55:38.932 --> 01:55:41.067 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF UNITS THAT IS

01:55:39.966 --> 01:55:42.969 region:rollup2
STUDENT TAKES EACH SEMESTER OR

01:55:41.067 --> 01:55:44.471 region:rollup2
EACH YEAR.

01:55:42.969 --> 01:55:45.505 region:rollup2
QUALIFYING STUDENTS WOULD

01:55:44.471 --> 01:55:46.640 region:rollup2
RECEIVE A GRAND IF THEY TAKE.

01:55:45.505 --> 01:55:48.842 region:rollup2
TWELVE AND FIFTEEN UNITS PER

01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:50.343 region:rollup2
SEMESTER. OR TWENTY FOUR AND

01:55:48.842 --> 01:55:51.745 region:rollup2
THIRTY UNITS PER YEAR.

01:55:50.343 --> 01:55:52.913 region:rollup2
THE LEVEL OF THE GRANT INCREASES

01:55:51.745 --> 01:55:55.015 region:rollup2
FOR EACH ADDITIONAL UNIT THAT IS

01:55:52.913 --> 01:55:56.483 region:rollup2
STUDENT TAKES PER SEMESTER.

01:55:55.015 --> 01:55:58.552 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY STUDENTS TAKING

01:55:56.483 --> 01:56:00.187 region:rollup2
TWELVE UNITS PER SEMESTER WOULD

01:55:58.552 --> 01:56:02.322 region:rollup2
RECEIVE A THOUSAND PER YEAR

01:56:00.187 --> 01:56:02.923 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN UNITS WOULD RECEIVE A

01:56:02.322 --> 01:56:04.224 region:rollup2
THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PER

01:56:02.923 --> 01:56:05.458 region:rollup2
YEAR.

01:56:04.224 --> 01:56:07.127 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN UNITS WOULD RECEIVE

01:56:05.458 --> 01:56:08.528 region:rollup2
NINETEEN HUNDRED PER YEAR AND

01:56:07.127 --> 01:56:10.864 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN OR MORE UNITS WOULD

01:56:08.528 --> 01:56:11.498 region:rollup2
RECEIVE FOUR THOUSAND PER YEAR.

01:56:10.864 --> 01:56:15.802 region:rollup2
AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE

01:56:11.498 --> 01:56:17.971 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

01:56:15.802 --> 01:56:18.872 region:rollup2
ALEJO'S.

01:56:17.971 --> 01:56:20.607 region:rollup2
WE RECOMMEND PROJECTING THE

01:56:18.872 --> 01:56:21.775 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND WE LAID

01:56:20.607 --> 01:56:23.844 region:rollup2
OUT AN ALTERNATIVE IN OUR

01:56:21.775 --> 01:56:25.712 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS FOR YOU AND SO THE

01:56:23.844 --> 01:56:26.179 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE COSTS MORE. I'LL GET

01:56:25.712 --> 01:56:29.483 region:rollup2
AT THAT.

01:56:26.179 --> 01:56:30.350 region:rollup2
WE THINK IT'S BETTER POLICY AND

01:56:29.483 --> 01:56:32.385 region:rollup2
YOU COULD PHASE IT IN OVER TIME.

01:56:30.350 --> 01:56:33.887 region:rollup2
SO FOR EXAMPLE IT COSTS MORE

01:56:32.385 --> 01:56:35.522 region:rollup2
THAN TWO HUNDRED MILLION MORE

01:56:33.887 --> 01:56:36.623 region:rollup2
THAN WHAT WE EXISTING AS A STATE

01:56:35.522 --> 01:56:38.959 region:rollup2
SPEND FOR COMMITTEE COLLEGE

01:56:36.623 --> 01:56:40.327 region:rollup2
STATE AID IF YOU PHASE IT IN

01:56:38.959 --> 01:56:41.428 region:rollup2
OVER FIVE YEARS IT WOULD BE AN

01:56:40.327 --> 01:56:42.863 region:rollup2
AUGMENTATION OF ABOUT FORTY

01:56:41.428 --> 01:56:44.564 region:rollup2
MILLION A YEAR THE GOVERNOR'S

01:56:42.863 --> 01:56:45.165 region:rollup2
PROPOSING THIS YEAR AGAIN

01:56:44.564 --> 01:56:46.333 region:rollup2
AUGMENTATION OF. THIRTY THREE

01:56:45.165 --> 01:56:48.502 region:rollup2
MILLION.

01:56:46.333 --> 01:56:50.170 region:rollup2
SO I AM ALTHOUGH IT COST

01:56:48.502 --> 01:56:52.472 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIALLY MORE IT DOES

01:56:50.170 --> 01:56:53.039 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL STREAMLINING AND

01:56:52.472 --> 01:56:54.708 region:rollup2
AGAIN IT MEETS.

01:56:53.039 --> 01:56:56.109 region:rollup2
BUT BUILT OFF OF MANY OF THE

01:56:54.708 --> 01:56:58.612 region:rollup2
PRINCIPLES THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT

01:56:56.109 --> 01:57:01.114 region:rollup2
EARLIER SO FOCUSES ON TOTAL COST

01:56:58.612 --> 01:57:03.049 region:rollup2
OF ATTENDANCE NOT JUST TUITION.

01:57:01.114 --> 01:57:04.084 region:rollup2
IT COVERS STUDENTS IF THEY HAVE

01:57:03.049 --> 01:57:06.553 region:rollup2
ANY UNMET NEED IN OUR

01:57:04.084 --> 01:57:07.487 region:rollup2
FINANCIALLY NEEDY NOT JUST THOSE

01:57:06.553 --> 01:57:08.889 region:rollup2
WHO MEET CERTAIN AGE OUR GPA

01:57:07.487 --> 01:57:10.357 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS.

01:57:08.889 --> 01:57:11.892 region:rollup2
I KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

01:57:10.357 --> 01:57:13.727 region:rollup2
THERE'S ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND CAL

01:57:11.892 --> 01:57:15.362 region:rollup2
GRANT RECIPIENTS WHO WOULD GET

01:57:13.727 --> 01:57:16.563 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE NEW DOLLAR AMOUNTS

01:57:15.362 --> 01:57:18.064 region:rollup2
I'M BUT ABOUT TWO THOUSAND

01:57:16.563 --> 01:57:20.333 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WHO WON AND I GET ANY

01:57:18.064 --> 01:57:23.570 region:rollup2
AWARD FOR NON TUITION COSTS.

01:57:20.333 --> 01:57:23.570 region:rollup2
MOST OF THE FOLKS NOT STUDENTS

01:57:23.637 --> 01:57:27.007 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE IT'S BECAUSE OUR TO

01:57:25.539 --> 01:57:29.309 region:rollup2
ALL THEIR MORE THAN ONE YEAR OUT

01:57:27.007 --> 01:57:31.111 region:rollup2
OF COURT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL.

01:57:29.309 --> 01:57:32.546 region:rollup2
I AM SO WE RECOMMEND STREAMING

01:57:31.111 --> 01:57:33.980 region:rollup2
STREAMLINED THE PROGRAM.

01:57:32.546 --> 01:57:35.782 region:rollup2
CREATING ONE PROGRAM ONE SET OF

01:57:33.980 --> 01:57:37.284 region:rollup2
RULES AGAIN THE GOVERNOR'S

01:57:35.782 --> 01:57:39.152 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL ALTHOUGH IT'S COUCHED

01:57:37.284 --> 01:57:40.820 region:rollup2
AS CONSOLIDATION TAKES TO AWARD

01:57:39.152 --> 01:57:42.622 region:rollup2
AMOUNTS AND CREATES FORWARD

01:57:40.820 --> 01:57:43.890 region:rollup2
AMOUNTS JUST FOR A VERY SELECT

01:57:42.622 --> 01:57:45.559 region:rollup2
GROUP OF STUDENTS.

01:57:43.890 --> 01:57:46.860 region:rollup2
AND EVEN WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT

01:57:45.559 --> 01:57:48.762 region:rollup2
WILL WHY WOULD THE STATE WHAT'S

01:57:46.860 --> 01:57:50.163 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC POLICY BENEFIT OF

01:57:48.762 --> 01:57:51.831 region:rollup2
MOVING FROM TWELVE UNITS TO

01:57:50.163 --> 01:57:53.199 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN UNITS WHY IS NOT WORTH

01:57:51.831 --> 01:57:54.968 region:rollup2
TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS.

01:57:53.199 --> 01:57:56.002 region:rollup2
DON'T REALLY GET VERY CLEAR AND.

01:57:54.968 --> 01:57:57.504 region:rollup2
A CLIFF SORT OF A CLEAR

01:57:56.002 --> 01:57:59.239 region:rollup2
EXPLANATION AS TO WHY THAT WOULD

01:57:57.504 --> 01:58:00.974 region:rollup2
BE HELPFUL. AND IF YOU THINK

01:57:59.239 --> 01:58:02.375 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE STUDENTS CALCULUS IF I

01:58:00.974 --> 01:58:03.710 region:rollup2
TAKE THE ONE EXTRA UNIT THAT'S

01:58:02.375 --> 01:58:05.412 region:rollup2
THREE EXTRA HOURS ON EITHER IN

01:58:03.710 --> 01:58:06.913 region:rollup2
COSTS ARE DOING HOME WHERE. I

01:58:05.412 --> 01:58:09.015 region:rollup2
COULD WORK THOSE THREE HOURS AND

01:58:06.913 --> 01:58:09.649 region:rollup2
MAKE FOR MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED

01:58:09.015 --> 01:58:09.849 region:rollup2
FIFTY DOLLARS DURING THE SCHOOL

01:58:09.649 --> 01:58:11.685 region:rollup2
YEAR.

01:58:09.849 --> 01:58:13.219 region:rollup2
I'M SO INSTEAD OF ALL THAT WE

01:58:11.685 --> 01:58:14.821 region:rollup2
USE JUST ONE PROGRAM ONE

01:58:13.219 --> 01:58:15.755 region:rollup2
STREAMLINED SET OF RULES IT

01:58:14.821 --> 01:58:17.557 region:rollup2
WOULD START WITH THE TOTAL COST

01:58:15.755 --> 01:58:19.125 region:rollup2
OF ATTENDANCE. IT WOULD BACK OUT

01:58:17.557 --> 01:58:21.328 region:rollup2
THE STUDENT FAMILIES EXPECTED

01:58:19.125 --> 01:58:23.830 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTION UNDER THE STANDARD

01:58:21.328 --> 01:58:24.631 region:rollup2
NATIONWIDE MEANS TASKS.

01:58:23.830 --> 01:58:25.765 region:rollup2
AND THEN IT WOULD ASSUME EVERY

01:58:24.631 --> 01:58:27.434 region:rollup2
STUDENT WORKS FIFTEEN HOURS A

01:58:25.765 --> 01:58:28.335 region:rollup2
WEEK YOU CAN MAKE A TIME YOU

01:58:27.434 --> 01:58:29.803 region:rollup2
COULD MAKE IT TWENTY RESEARCH

01:58:28.335 --> 01:58:31.171 region:rollup2
SAYS THAT IF STUDENTS WORK

01:58:29.803 --> 01:58:32.405 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TEN AND TWENTY

01:58:31.171 --> 01:58:33.506 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY THE ACADEMIC AND. OUT

01:58:32.405 --> 01:58:34.874 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES ARE GOOD THEY CAN EVEN

01:58:33.506 --> 01:58:35.475 region:rollup2
IMPROVE.

01:58:34.874 --> 01:58:43.717 region:rollup2
WE ASSUME NO STUDENT BORROWING

01:58:35.475 --> 01:58:44.951 region:rollup2
DO NOT USE GOING FULL TIME.

01:58:43.717 --> 01:58:46.586 region:rollup2
AND IS ONLY WORKING FIFTEEN

01:58:44.951 --> 01:58:47.921 region:rollup2
HOURS A WEEK THEY WON'T EARN

01:58:46.586 --> 01:58:49.522 region:rollup2
ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO COVER THE

01:58:47.921 --> 01:58:49.723 region:rollup2
FULL COST OF ATTENDANCE.

01:58:49.522 --> 01:58:51.324 region:rollup2
SO WE.

01:58:49.723 --> 01:58:54.160 region:rollup2
.

01:58:51.324 --> 01:58:55.328 region:rollup2
I GET AGAIN UNDER THE PROPOSAL

01:58:54.160 --> 01:58:56.630 region:rollup2
WHETHER YOU'RE NINETEEN ONE YEAR

01:58:55.328 --> 01:58:58.131 region:rollup2
OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND HAVE

01:58:56.630 --> 01:59:02.135 region:rollup2
UNMET NEED OR WHETHER YOU'RE

01:58:58.131 --> 01:59:03.770 region:rollup2
TWENTY NINE AND HAVE UNMET NEED

01:59:02.135 --> 01:59:05.839 region:rollup2
AND YOUR LIVES INDEPENDENTLY

01:59:03.770 --> 01:59:08.174 region:rollup2
YOU'RE LIVING AT HOME YOU HAVE

01:59:05.839 --> 01:59:10.076 region:rollup2
DEPENDENTS. TIME YOU DON'T HAVE

01:59:08.174 --> 01:59:12.278 region:rollup2
DEPENDENTS ALL OF THOSE STUDENTS

01:59:10.076 --> 01:59:13.947 region:rollup2
IF THEY HAVE UNMET NEED WOULD

01:59:12.278 --> 01:59:14.614 region:rollup2
QUALIFY FOR AID.

01:59:13.947 --> 01:59:16.383 region:rollup2
IT WILL COST FIVE HUNDRED

01:59:14.614 --> 01:59:17.951 region:rollup2
MILLION THE STATE TODAY PROVIDES

01:59:16.383 --> 01:59:18.852 region:rollup2
TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR MILLION

01:59:17.951 --> 01:59:20.020 region:rollup2
AN AID FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES

01:59:18.852 --> 01:59:21.454 region:rollup2
STUDENTS

01:59:20.020 --> 01:59:22.922 region:rollup2
SO TWO HUNDRED SOME MILLION MORE

01:59:21.454 --> 01:59:24.024 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THIS

01:59:22.922 --> 01:59:25.925 region:rollup2
OVERNIGHT. YOU WOULD THINK ABOUT

01:59:24.024 --> 01:59:26.593 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZING YOU COULD STAR AND

01:59:25.925 --> 01:59:28.228 region:rollup2
JUST SAY WELL WE'RE GONNA DO ALL

01:59:26.593 --> 01:59:30.063 region:rollup2
UNMET NEED FOR THOSE STUDENTS UP

01:59:28.228 --> 01:59:31.598 region:rollup2
UNTIL FIFTY THOUSAND AND THE

01:59:30.063 --> 01:59:33.900 region:rollup2
NEXT YEAR WILL TRY TO GET UP TO

01:59:31.598 --> 01:59:34.734 region:rollup2
FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND EXCITER OF.

01:59:33.900 --> 01:59:35.835 region:rollup2
OR YOU COULD SAY THIS YEAR WE'RE

01:59:34.734 --> 01:59:37.404 region:rollup2
JUST GONNA COVER SEVENTY FIVE

01:59:35.835 --> 01:59:38.271 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF OUR NET MIGHT NEED A

01:59:37.404 --> 01:59:39.873 region:rollup2
NEXT I WILL TRY TO GET UP TO

01:59:38.271 --> 01:59:41.041 region:rollup2
EIGHTY PERCENT. IF YOU USE THE

01:59:39.873 --> 01:59:43.076 region:rollup2
LATTER APPROACH YOU'RE

01:59:41.041 --> 01:59:44.177 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY SAYING YOU'RE GONNA

01:59:43.076 --> 01:59:46.980 region:rollup2
HAVE TO WORK A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:59:44.177 --> 01:59:48.515 region:rollup2
THAN FIFTEEN HOURS ARE YOU GONNA

01:59:46.980 --> 01:59:50.917 region:rollup2
HAVE TO TAKE OUT AND OUT TO MEET

01:59:48.515 --> 01:59:52.185 region:rollup2
THE REST OF THOSE ON TUITION

01:59:50.917 --> 01:59:53.286 region:rollup2
COSTS.

01:59:52.185 --> 01:59:54.688 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS WE THINK IT'S BETTER

01:59:53.286 --> 01:59:55.155 region:rollup2
POLICY IT'S EASIER FOR STUDENTS

01:59:54.688 --> 01:59:58.925 region:rollup2
AND ADMINISTRATORS TO

01:59:55.155 --> 01:59:59.893 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND.

01:59:58.925 --> 02:00:01.995 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH THE AGENDA HIGHLIGHTS

01:59:59.893 --> 02:00:04.197 region:rollup2
MANY ADVANTAGES OF A STREAMLINED

02:00:01.995 --> 02:00:05.098 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IT DOES HIGHLIGHT THREE

02:00:04.197 --> 02:00:06.366 region:rollup2
CONCERN THERE WON'T SPEND JUST A

02:00:05.098 --> 02:00:07.901 region:rollup2
MOMENT REACTING TO THOSE THREE

02:00:06.366 --> 02:00:08.735 region:rollup2
CONCERNS SO ONE IS THAT.

02:00:07.901 --> 02:00:09.369 region:rollup2
.

02:00:08.735 --> 02:00:11.037 region:rollup2
WHY I CREATE A PROGRAM FOR THE

02:00:09.369 --> 02:00:11.871 region:rollup2
COLLEGES AS OPPOSED TO JUST

02:00:11.037 --> 02:00:13.373 region:rollup2
REWRITE CAO GRANTS AS WE KNOW IT

02:00:11.871 --> 02:00:15.141 region:rollup2
YOU COULD YOU COULD REWRITE THE

02:00:13.373 --> 02:00:16.309 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT EXIST TODAY FOR

02:00:15.141 --> 02:00:17.877 region:rollup2
ALL STUDENTS?

02:00:16.309 --> 02:00:19.512 region:rollup2
YOU COULD USE THE SAME APPROACH

02:00:17.877 --> 02:00:21.548 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE LAID OUT HERE IS VERY

02:00:19.512 --> 02:00:23.349 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TO THE UC APPROACH.

02:00:21.548 --> 02:00:24.551 region:rollup2
AND ALL WE'RE SUGGESTING IS

02:00:23.349 --> 02:00:26.186 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVELY YOU COULD START

02:00:24.551 --> 02:00:26.820 region:rollup2
WITH ONE STATEMENT AND YOU COULD

02:00:26.186 --> 02:00:29.923 region:rollup2
DO WITH THE STATEMENT THAT HAS

02:00:26.820 --> 02:00:30.890 region:rollup2
THE GREATEST UNMET NEED.

02:00:29.923 --> 02:00:32.559 region:rollup2
THERE'S A CONCERN THAT MAYBE

02:00:30.890 --> 02:00:34.327 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE FINANCIAL AID

02:00:32.559 --> 02:00:34.894 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATORS JUST WILL WON'T

02:00:34.327 --> 02:00:36.362 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO FIGURE THIS THING

02:00:34.894 --> 02:00:38.064 region:rollup2
OUT.

02:00:36.362 --> 02:00:39.966 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK IT'S LEFT ADAM

02:00:38.064 --> 02:00:41.668 region:rollup2
STARTED TO BE SAD WHETHER THE

02:00:39.966 --> 02:00:42.902 region:rollup2
NEW PROGRAM WITH ONE SET OF

02:00:41.668 --> 02:00:44.871 region:rollup2
RULES IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE

02:00:42.902 --> 02:00:47.373 region:rollup2
ANYMORE COMPLICATED THAN THE

02:00:44.871 --> 02:00:48.174 region:rollup2
FORCE THAT'S OF EXISTING RULES

02:00:47.373 --> 02:00:48.808 region:rollup2
ON EXISTING PROGRAMS FINANCIAL

02:00:48.174 --> 02:00:49.743 region:rollup2
AID ADMINISTRATORS HAVE TO DEAL

02:00:48.808 --> 02:00:51.744 region:rollup2
WITH TODAY.

02:00:49.743 --> 02:00:52.645 region:rollup2
AND THE FINAL POINT WAS SOME OF

02:00:51.744 --> 02:00:54.147 region:rollup2
THIS MONEY RIGHT NOW IS BEING

02:00:52.645 --> 02:00:55.682 region:rollup2

SOMETHING ELSE YOU WANT TO BE

.

02:02:12.892 --> 02:02:15.562 region:rollup2
MANY COLLEGES RIGHT CRISSCROSS

02:02:15.028 --> 02:02:15.962 region:rollup2
WHENEVER THE CHANCELLOR'S

AGAIN WE APPRECIATE THE

02:02:16.462 --> 02:02:19.065 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO

02:02:17.463 --> 02:02:21.034 region:rollup2
STREAMLINE THAT THE NEWLY

CREATED PROGRAMS AS DISCUSSED

02:02:21.034 --> 02:02:23.369 region:rollup2
EARLIER MAKING FINANCIALLY IT

02:02:22.135 --> 02:02:24.504 region:rollup2
EASIER TO UNDERSTAND WILL MAKE

02:02:23.369 --> 02:02:26.039 region:rollup2
IT MORE LIKELY THAT THE FUNDS

02:02:24.504 --> 02:02:28.174 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE THEIR INTENDED IMPACT

02:02:26.039 --> 02:02:28.675 region:rollup2
WHICH IS ENCOURAGING BEHAVIOR

02:02:28.174 --> 02:02:29.142 region:rollup2
THAT LEADS TO. CULTURAL

02:02:28.675 --> 02:02:30.944 region:rollup2
POLLUTION.

02:02:29.142 --> 02:02:32.011 region:rollup2
I DID WANT TO LINK IT TO THE

02:02:30.944 --> 02:02:33.847 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS DISCUSSION SOME OF

02:02:32.011 --> 02:02:35.315 region:rollup2
THESE TO PROGRAMS WE'RE TALKING

02:02:33.847 --> 02:02:36.716 region:rollup2
ABOUT STUDENTS WHO CURRENTLY

02:02:35.315 --> 02:02:38.651 region:rollup2
RECEIVE THE CALGARY HAPPY SO FOR

02:02:36.716 --> 02:02:39.686 region:rollup2
CONTEXT. WE HAVE ABOUT A MILLION

02:02:38.651 --> 02:02:41.721 region:rollup2
STUDENTS RECEIVE THE COLLEGE

02:02:39.686 --> 02:02:43.156 region:rollup2
PROMISED GRANTS BUT A HUNDRED

02:02:41.721 --> 02:02:44.157 region:rollup2
THOUSAND THOSE ONE IN TEN

02:02:43.156 --> 02:02:46.326 region:rollup2
RECEIVED A TELEGRAM PIECE SO WE

02:02:44.157 --> 02:02:48.761 region:rollup2
ARE TALKING ABOUT. FINANCIAL AID

02:02:46.326 --> 02:02:50.697 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT MEET THE NEEDS OF

02:02:48.761 --> 02:02:52.031 region:rollup2
A SUBSET OF STUDENTS.

02:02:50.697 --> 02:02:53.233 region:rollup2
THAT SAID ALL AT OUR

02:02:52.031 --> 02:02:54.567 region:rollup2
CONCURRENCE THAT WHEN STUDENTS

02:02:53.233 --> 02:02:55.602 region:rollup2
ARE ON A GUIDED PATHWAYS AND

02:02:54.567 --> 02:02:57.604 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO

02:02:55.602 --> 02:02:59.772 region:rollup2
DO SO TAKING FIFTEEN UNITS AKE

02:02:57.604 --> 02:03:00.406 region:rollup2
SENSE AND IT SUPPORTS THE GOALS

02:02:59.772 --> 02:03:01.608 region:rollup2
WE'VE INCLUDED IN THE VISION FOR

02:03:00.406 --> 02:03:02.876 region:rollup2
SUCCESS.

02:03:01.608 --> 02:03:04.410 region:rollup2
WE I'M GONNA GET IN THE WEEDS WE

02:03:02.876 --> 02:03:05.778 region:rollup2
WANTED OUT JUST A FEW TECHNICAL

02:03:04.410 --> 02:03:07.113 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT HAVE COME UP AS

02:03:05.778 --> 02:03:08.648 region:rollup2
WE'VE IMPLEMENTED THESE TWO

02:03:07.113 --> 02:03:09.515 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THE PAST FEW YEARS. IN

02:03:08.648 --> 02:03:10.617 region:rollup2
AS WE'VE DISCUSSED THE

02:03:09.515 --> 02:03:11.584 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WITH OUR

02:03:10.617 --> 02:03:12.952 region:rollup2
COLLEGES.

02:03:11.584 --> 02:03:14.821 region:rollup2
FIRST THE COMPLETION GRANT

02:03:12.952 --> 02:03:15.722 region:rollup2
REQUIRES THAT STUDENTS.

02:03:14.821 --> 02:03:16.756 region:rollup2
HAVE COMPLETED AN EDUCATION

02:03:15.722 --> 02:03:17.924 region:rollup2
PLAN AS A CONDITION OF RECEIVING

02:03:16.756 --> 02:03:19.292 region:rollup2
THE FUNDS.

02:03:17.924 --> 02:03:21.160 region:rollup2
AND AND I WOULD SAY THE GUIDED

02:03:19.292 --> 02:03:22.128 region:rollup2
PATHWAYS FRAMEWORK EXPECTS THAT

02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:23.763 region:rollup2
STUDENTS HAVE AN EDUCATIONAL

02:03:22.128 --> 02:03:25.531 region:rollup2
GOAL UP FRONT THAT THERE PUTTING

02:03:23.763 --> 02:03:26.799 region:rollup2
THEM ON PATHWAYS. TO MEET THOSE

02:03:25.531 --> 02:03:28.134 region:rollup2
GOALS FOR COMMITTED TO MAKING

02:03:26.799 --> 02:03:30.069 region:rollup2
SURE THAT STUDENTS ARE PLANTS

02:03:28.134 --> 02:03:31.104 region:rollup2
THAT REFLECT THOSE SCHOOLS.

02:03:30.069 --> 02:03:32.272 region:rollup2
WITHOUT SAID AS WE'VE

02:03:31.104 --> 02:03:33.406 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED THE COMPLETION GRANT

02:03:32.272 --> 02:03:34.607 region:rollup2
WE FOUND THAT IT'S OFTEN

02:03:33.406 --> 02:03:36.843 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT FOR THE PLANTS TO

02:03:34.607 --> 02:03:37.410 region:rollup2
REACH THE FINANCIAL AID OFFICES

02:03:36.843 --> 02:03:38.444 region:rollup2
TO ALLOW FOR STUDENTS TO BE

02:03:37.410 --> 02:03:40.146 region:rollup2
PAID.

02:03:38.444 --> 02:03:41.981 region:rollup2
OTHER FINANCIAL AID IN A TIMELY

02:03:40.146 --> 02:03:42.949 region:rollup2
WAY AND WERE WELL WE'RE WORKING

02:03:41.981 --> 02:03:44.284 region:rollup2
TO IMPROVE COORDINATION AND

02:03:42.949 --> 02:03:46.352 region:rollup2
THAT'S A KEY PART OF GUIDED

02:03:44.284 --> 02:03:47.287 region:rollup2
PATHWAYS TO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:03:46.352 --> 02:03:49.455 region:rollup2
THAT STUDENTS WHO CAN GET THEIR

02:03:47.287 --> 02:03:51.257 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AID EARLY. AND A WHAT

02:03:49.455 --> 02:03:52.458 region:rollup2
MAKES THE MOST DIFFERENCE SO I

02:03:51.257 --> 02:03:52.959 region:rollup2
THINK WE

02:03:52.458 --> 02:03:53.526 region:rollup2
WE HOPE THAT WE HAVE A

02:03:52.959 --> 02:03:54.627 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION WITH YOU ABOUT

02:03:53.526 --> 02:03:55.595 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:03:54.627 --> 02:03:57.230 region:rollup2
SECOND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

02:03:55.595 --> 02:03:58.131 region:rollup2
SPECIFIES DIFFERENT LEVELS OF

02:03:57.230 --> 02:03:59.565 region:rollup2
FUNDING BASED ON THE NUMBER OF

02:03:58.131 --> 02:04:01.200 region:rollup2
UNITS

02:03:59.565 --> 02:04:02.535 region:rollup2
OUR EXISTING SYSTEM RIGHT NOW IS

02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:04.170 region:rollup2
SET UP TO WARD FINANCIAL AID

02:04:02.535 --> 02:04:07.073 region:rollup2
BASED ON SOME THRESHOLDS THREE

02:04:04.170 --> 02:04:08.641 region:rollup2
SIX NINE. TWELVE FIFTEEN UNITS

02:04:07.073 --> 02:04:10.343 region:rollup2
AND SO SETTING UP SYSTEMS THAT

02:04:08.641 --> 02:04:12.545 region:rollup2
ARE JUST FINANCIAL AID PER UNIT.

02:04:10.343 --> 02:04:13.680 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT AN INSIGNIFICANT

02:04:12.545 --> 02:04:15.982 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE READ HAVE BOTH ONE

02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:17.483 region:rollup2
TIME WORKLOAD TO PROGRAM SYSTEMS

02:04:15.982 --> 02:04:19.052 region:rollup2
AND SOME ONGOING PROCESS IS THAT

02:04:17.483 --> 02:04:21.020 region:rollup2
WE NEED TEMPLATE TO MONITOR UNIT

02:04:19.052 --> 02:04:22.355 region:rollup2
BY UNIT CHANGES AND STUDENTS

02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:23.890 region:rollup2
COURSE TAKING BEHAVIOR.

02:04:22.355 --> 02:04:26.059 region:rollup2
SO I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT.

02:04:23.890 --> 02:04:27.660 region:rollup2
WE THINK STILL ARE IT MAKES

02:04:26.059 --> 02:04:29.529 region:rollup2
SENSE THAT STUDENTS THAT IF THEY

02:04:27.660 --> 02:04:30.563 region:rollup2
CAN ON PATHWAYS TO TAKE FIFTEEN

02:04:29.529 --> 02:04:32.665 region:rollup2
UNITS TO TRANSFERRING COMPLETE

02:04:30.563 --> 02:04:34.267 region:rollup2
IN A TIMELY WAY. WE THINK IT'S

02:04:32.665 --> 02:04:35.868 region:rollup2
SO IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT THE

02:04:34.267 --> 02:04:36.936 region:rollup2
BALANCE BETWEEN THESE UNITS

02:04:35.868 --> 02:04:39.405 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC INCENTIVES.

02:04:36.936 --> 02:04:40.840 region:rollup2
WITH ADMINISTERING THE COSTS IN

02:04:39.405 --> 02:04:41.407 region:rollup2
A IN AN EFFICIENT WAY.

02:04:40.840 --> 02:04:41.708 region:rollup2
WE'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

02:04:41.407 --> 02:04:45.812 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

02:04:41.708 --> 02:04:47.146 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

02:04:45.812 --> 02:04:48.448 region:rollup2
WE'LL BE BACK ALLOW BEHALF OF

02:04:47.146 --> 02:04:49.349 region:rollup2
THE CONFERENCE TO NAY COMMISSION

02:04:48.448 --> 02:04:49.983 region:rollup2
AS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER THE

02:04:49.349 --> 02:04:51.351 region:rollup2
COMMISSION IS GENERALLY

02:04:49.983 --> 02:04:52.318 region:rollup2

FINANCIALLY WHEREVER POSSIBLE WE

ITS ADDITIONAL GRANT AID. FOR

02:04:58.224 --> 02:05:01.194 region:rollup2
COMEY COLLEGE STUDENTS WE

02:04:59.525 --> 02:05:02.929 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE THAT COMMITTEE COLLEGE

02:05:01.194 --> 02:05:04.063 region:rollup2
STUDENTS OFTEN RECEIVE THE LEAST

SUPPORT FOR NON TUITION COSTS

02:05:04.063 --> 02:05:06.966 region:rollup2
SUCH BOOKS SUPPLIES AND LIVING

02:05:05.798 --> 02:05:07.533 region:rollup2
COSTS.

02:05:06.966 --> 02:05:08.401 region:rollup2
WE SUPPORT ANY EFFORT TO
