UNDERFUNDED AT THE NATIONAL

LEVEL. SO YOU CAN GET A LITTLE

01:13:53.996 --> 01:13:54.930
LOWER THAN 54% I MEAN THAT'S

DO THEY WENT INTO THE PAID THEY

01:25:14.709 --> 01:25:16.211
WENT INTO THE INELIGIBLE. THEY

01:25:16.277 --> 01:25:18.713
WENT INTO PENDING- THAT'S AT

01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:20.515
THE VERY BOTTOM YOU SEE.

01:25:20.582 --> 01:25:22.050
RESOLUTION DO SO THAT'S EXACTLY

01:25:22.116 --> 01:25:23.384
MY QUESTION SO THE PAID NUMBER

01:25:23.451 --> 01:25:24.652
CANNOT GO UP ONE FROM FOUR

01:25:24.719 --> 01:25:25.987
POINT EIGHT TO FOUR POINT NINE.

01:25:26.054 --> 01:25:29.858
THE INELIGIBLE WENT UP BY 1%

01:25:29.924 --> 01:25:30.391
ONE SIXTY TWO TO ONE SIXTY

01:25:30.458 --> 01:25:33.361
FOURTH. BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:25:33.428 --> 01:25:34.796
SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE SO

01:25:34.863 --> 01:25:37.532
JUST I DON'T SEE HOW THAT MATH

01:25:37.599 --> 01:25:40.935
COMPUTES. DOES THAT BECAUSE I

01:25:41.002 --> 01:25:44.572
CAN. YES IT IS DISCUSSING AND

01:25:44.639 --> 01:25:45.707
IT IS DISPERSED THROUGH THE

01:25:45.773 --> 01:25:47.775
VARIOUS BUCKETS- IF YOU WANT TO

01:25:47.842 --> 01:25:48.977
COMPLETE RECONCILIATION WE

01:25:49.043 --> 01:25:50.778
CERTAINLY CAN TAKE THAT BACK IN

01:25:50.845 --> 01:25:52.213
SENATE TO AFTER THE HEARING BUT

01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:53.648
CAN YOU GIVE ME A SENSE OF IF

01:25:53.715 --> 01:25:54.983
YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU PROCESS

01:25:55.049 --> 01:25:56.351
ALMOST SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:25:56.417 --> 01:25:57.685
CLAIMANTS DID MOST OF THOSE

01:25:57.752 --> 01:25:59.554
FOLKS GET PAID. FOR MOST OF

01:25:59.621 --> 01:26:01.789
THOSE FOLKS DECLARED INELIGIBLE

01:26:01.856 --> 01:26:03.725
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM. WHAT

01:26:03.791 --> 01:26:05.293
SOME OF THEM GOT PAID SOME OF

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:07.161
THEM GOT UP FOUND AN ELIGIBLE

01:26:07.228 --> 01:26:09.531
AS A DATE IT REFLECTS AND- IS

01:26:09.597 --> 01:26:10.565
KNOWN TO THE PENDING

01:26:10.632 --> 01:26:12.767
RESOLUTION. I'M SORRY THE DATE

01:26:12.834 --> 01:26:19.774
IS ON FRONT OF US. RIGHT. SO

01:26:19.841 --> 01:26:24.212
THE CHART ON EIGHT TWENTY. SOME

01:26:24.279 --> 01:26:27.448
AT PLUS TWO FIRST 42% INCREASE

01:26:27.515 --> 01:26:29.284
IN A MORE PEOPLE GOT PAID- OF

01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:34.289
SOME PEOPLE- FEWER PEOPLE WERE

01:26:34.355 --> 01:26:35.990
ARE MORE PEOPLE WERE FOUND IN

01:26:36.057 --> 01:26:38.660
ELIGIBLE. THAT WENT UP AND THEN.

01:26:38.726 --> 01:26:41.696
MORE CASES CAME- TO EDT THAT

01:26:41.763 --> 01:26:43.531
NEED TO BE RESOLVED AND BE

01:26:43.598 --> 01:26:46.467
TOUCHED BY IT AT INDIVIDUAL.

01:26:46.534 --> 01:26:47.335
SUFFRAGISTS RESTATE THE

01:26:47.402 --> 01:26:48.903
QUESTION I'M SORRY I'M JUST I'M

01:26:48.970 --> 01:26:50.638
JUST BAFFLED BY THESE NUMBERS

01:26:50.705 --> 01:26:52.640
AGAIN SO YOU SAY THAT. THERE

01:26:52.707 --> 01:26:55.677
WERE SIX ABOUT CLOSE TO SIX

01:26:55.743 --> 01:26:56.311
HUNDRED THOUSAND FOLKS THAT YOU

01:26:56.377 --> 01:26:56.878
MANAGE A PROCESS IN THE LAST

01:26:56.945 --> 01:26:58.112
MONTH AND THAT'S GREAT. WHAT

01:26:58.179 --> 01:26:59.414
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS WHY

01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:01.583
DID THE UNPAID NUMBER ONLY GO

01:27:01.649 --> 01:27:04.919
UP BY A HUNDRED THOUSAND. AND

01:27:04.986 --> 01:27:05.520
THE INELIGIBLE NUMBER ONLY GO

01:27:05.587 --> 01:27:08.723
UP BY. LOOKS LIKE TWO THOUSAND.

01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:10.792
SO WHAT HAPPENED TO A HALF A

01:27:10.858 --> 01:27:11.326
MILLION PEOPLE WHERE THEY

01:27:11.392 --> 01:27:15.897
REFLECTED IN THIS. THE NUMBERS

01:27:15.964 --> 01:27:18.366

IT IS DISBURSED FOR ALL THE

01:27:32.246 --> 01:27:35.650
BUCKETS AND. WE'LL GET BACK TO

01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:45.693
GOING BACK TO. FOUR WHERE YOU

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:46.961

THINK OR DO THEY ARE DO. NOT AT

01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:09.584
THIS TIME BUT THAT'S SOMETHING

01:28:09.651 --> 01:28:10.752
WE'RE DISCUSSING WITH THE

01:28:10.818 --> 01:28:13.054
STRAIGHT TEAM- LIKE I SAID WE

01:28:13.121 --> 01:28:14.322

HOLISTIC INFORMATION THAT IS

01:28:16.491 --> 01:28:17.959
THAT REALLY LAYS OUT THE

01:28:18.026 --> 01:28:18.893
EXPERIENCE THE CUSTOMER

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:21.195

01:28:50.324 --> 01:28:52.560
HOW MANY CALLS ARE ANSWERING.

01:28:52.627 --> 01:28:53.161

01:42:47.528 --> 01:42:52.966
pSECRETARY WHO'S HELPING TO HEAD

01:42:53.033 --> 01:42:54.868
UP THE STRIKE FORCE TEAM. MY

01:42:54.935 --> 01:42:56.837
REAL CONCERN ABOUT THE STRIKE

01:42:56.904 --> 01:42:57.404
FOUR SEPARATE IS THAT IT'S

01:42:57.471 --> 01:43:00.140
GOING TO AND- MID SEPTEMBER-

01:43:00.207 --> 01:43:01.708
AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE THINKS

01:43:01.775 --> 01:43:03.043
THAT WE CAN TURN THE TITANIC

01:43:03.110 --> 01:43:05.646
AROUND. IN FORTY FIVE DAYS THE

01:43:05.712 --> 01:43:06.914

AT THE DMV WHICH TOOK SIX

01:43:10.817 --> 01:43:13.320
MONTHS OF ENGAGEMENT. SO IF I

01:43:13.387 --> 01:43:14.454
CANNOT A LOT TO ASK THE

01:43:14.521 --> 01:43:17.758
SECRETARY- IF. SHE HAS THOUGHTS

01:43:17.824 --> 01:43:20.761
ON. HOW TO ENSURE THAT AFTER

FORTY FIVE DAYS WHATEVER THE

01:43:22.195 --> 01:43:24.097

THAT THAT IMPLEMENTS SYSTEMIC

01:43:33.273 --> 01:43:35.776
REFORM. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S

01:43:35.842 --> 01:43:36.977
GREAT AND IF THERE'S NO ANSWER

01:43:37.044 --> 01:43:38.245

OFFICE IS HOVERS BETWEEN FOUR

01:46:54.474 --> 01:46:56.276
TO FIVE STAFFERS. I WOULD HAVE

01:46:56.343 --> 01:46:57.811
EXPECTED THAT AN AGENCY LIKE

01:46:57.878 --> 01:47:00.380
EDT. WOULD HAVE THE SYSTEMS IN

01:47:00.447 --> 01:47:03.183
PLACE. TO BE ABLE TO CAPTURE

01:47:03.250 --> 01:47:04.518
ALL OF THIS DATA SO THAT YOU

01:47:04.584 --> 01:47:07.921
CAN CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE. HOW

01:47:07.988 --> 01:47:08.421
YOU'RE DELIVERING THOSE

01:47:08.488 --> 01:47:12.159
SERVICES. SO I DON'T KNOW IF

01:47:12.225 --> 01:47:13.794
WE'RE JUST BEING KEPT IN THE

01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:16.596
DARK. AS YOU'RE TRYING TO WORK

01:47:16.663 --> 01:47:21.234
THROUGH ISSUES. OR IF YOU

01:47:21.301 --> 01:47:23.370
REALLY DON'T COLLECT THAT DATA

01:47:23.436 --> 01:47:25.071
AND NOW YOU'VE STARTED JUST TO

01:47:25.138 --> 01:47:26.907
HAVE TO COLLECT DATA BECAUSE

01:47:26.973 --> 01:47:28.642
THERE WAS SERIES OF HARSH

01:47:28.708 --> 01:47:32.479
QUESTIONS COMING YOUR WAY. BUT

01:47:32.546 --> 01:47:34.681

EVERYTHING IT HELPS RESOLVE

01:47:38.418 --> 01:47:42.656
MANY ISSUES YOU KNOW THIS. SO

01:47:42.722 --> 01:47:45.058

MONTHLY BASIS WE GET THOSE

OUR VISIT. IT FOR THE

01:49:30.764 --> 01:49:32.499
REPLACEMENT OF THE BENEFIT OF

01:49:32.565 --> 01:49:36.036
SYSTEMS- WE DID EXTENSIVE-

01:49:36.102 --> 01:49:39.673
MARKET RESEARCH AND- WE- MATT

01:49:39.739 --> 01:49:41.875

VENDORS IN THE U. Y. A. D. I.

01:49:52.352 --> 01:49:54.621
ROUND. AND HAD- COMPREHENSIVE

01:49:54.688 --> 01:49:56.589
OF DEMONSTRATIONS OF THEIR

01:49:56.656 --> 01:50:00.360
SYSTEMS- AND THEN WHEN WE WENT

01:50:00.427 --> 01:50:02.529
OUT TO BID WE MADE SURE THAT

01:50:02.595 --> 01:50:06.166
ALL THOSE VENDORS THAT. THE OUT

01:50:06.232 --> 01:50:08.335
THERE THEY WERE WELL AWARE OF

01:50:08.401 --> 01:50:10.837
OUR PROCUREMENT AND- AT YOU

01:50:10.904 --> 01:50:14.140
KNOW INVITED THEM TO BID. OUT

01:50:14.207 --> 01:50:15.141
TO ENSURE WE HAD A GREAT POOL

01:50:15.208 --> 01:50:18.845
OF VENDORS TO SELECT FROM- AND

01:50:18.912 --> 01:50:20.180
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE DID

01:50:20.246 --> 01:50:21.848
WE'RE JUST IN THE PROCESS OF

01:50:21.915 --> 01:50:23.683
THE NARROWING IT DOWN AND HOPE

01:50:23.750 --> 01:50:26.019
TO. YOU KNOW. COME UP WITH A

01:50:26.086 --> 01:50:27.420
VENDOR SOON DIRECTOR OF

01:50:27.487 --> 01:50:29.055
PROCUREMENT PROCESS WHICH I

01:50:29.122 --> 01:50:30.490
APPRECIATE THAT BUT BUT AGAIN

01:50:30.557 --> 01:50:32.359
BUT I'M TRYING TO ASK IS NOT

01:50:32.425 --> 01:50:34.427
JUST WHEN YOU'RE IN THE PROCESS

01:50:34.494 --> 01:50:37.697
OF. HAVING TO FIND A VENDOR. MY

01:50:37.764 --> 01:50:41.568
QUESTION IS. AS TECHNOLOGY

01:50:41.634 --> 01:50:44.637
CHANGES AS YOU MAINTAINING DATA

01:50:44.704 --> 01:50:46.406
AND YOU SEE THAT THE NEEDS OF

01:50:46.473 --> 01:50:49.776
YOUR AGENCY ARE CHANGING. THEE

01:50:49.843 --> 01:50:51.911
ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPLORE

01:50:51.978 --> 01:50:54.514
AND SEE WHAT PRODUCTS THERE ARE

01:50:54.581 --> 01:50:58.485
IN THE MARKET SPACE AND HOW HOW

01:50:58.551 --> 01:51:00.587
IT CAN BETTER HELP YOUR-

01:51:00.653 --> 01:51:03.123
PROGRAMS VERSES THE ONE YOU MAY

01:51:03.189 --> 01:51:05.658
BE EMPLOYING RIGHT NOW. SO WHAT

01:51:05.725 --> 01:51:07.327
WHAT ARE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES

01:51:07.394 --> 01:51:10.196
AND I OBVIOUSLY I THINK I DON'T

01:51:10.263 --> 01:51:11.598
WANT THE LEGISLATURE TO BE TRUE

01:51:11.664 --> 01:51:13.800
ENGAGED IN SOME OF THAT PROCESS

01:51:13.867 --> 01:51:16.369
BUT AGAIN AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM

01:51:16.436 --> 01:51:20.140
MANY OF THE PANELISTS HERE. WE

01:51:20.206 --> 01:51:22.208
ARE APPROACHED AND WE ARE

01:51:22.275 --> 01:51:24.310
OFFERED THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW

01:51:24.377 --> 01:51:27.547
THINGS CAN IMPROVE AND SO WHAT

01:51:27.614 --> 01:51:28.515
WHEN OU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF

01:51:28.581 --> 01:51:30.683
THIS I SUSPECT THAT YOU GET

01:51:30.750 --> 01:51:32.652
APPROACHED ON A MUCH MORE

01:51:32.719 --> 01:51:36.556
FREQUENT BASIS. AND YET NONE OF

01:51:36.623 --> 01:51:41.428
THOSE. APPROACHES HAVE YIELDED

01:51:41.494 --> 01:51:44.130
A CHANGE IN WHO WE HAVE BEEN

01:51:44.197 --> 01:51:45.465
EMPLOYING AS A STATE OR AS A

01:51:45.532 --> 01:51:48.068
DEPARTMENT. IN THE LAST TEN

01:51:48.134 --> 01:51:51.104
YEARS SO. SOMETHING HAS BEEN

01:51:51.171 --> 01:51:52.672
VERY COMPELLING ABOUT THIS ONE

01:51:52.739 --> 01:51:56.709
COMPANY. YET THEY HAVE TIME AND

01:51:56.776 --> 01:51:57.277
TIME AGAIN NOT BEEN ABLE TO

01:51:57.343 --> 01:52:00.013
DELIVER. I'M JUST TRYING TO

01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:05.652
BETTER UNDERSTAND A- DO WE TAKE

01:52:05.718 --> 01:52:08.321
FULL ADVANTAGE OF LEARNING AND

01:52:08.388 --> 01:52:09.856
BEING OPEN TO WHAT'S GOING ON

01:52:09.923 --> 01:52:12.058
IN THE MARKET SPACE NOT JUST

01:52:12.125 --> 01:52:14.160
DURING THE TIMES THAT WE'RE

01:52:14.227 --> 01:52:19.199
EVALUATING A CONTRACT. TO IT'S

01:52:19.265 --> 01:52:21.334
JUST INTERESTING TO ME WHY A

01:52:21.401 --> 01:52:23.236
COMPANY THAT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE

01:52:23.303 --> 01:52:25.038
TO DELIVER CONTINUES TO BE

01:52:25.105 --> 01:52:26.906
REWARDED BUT I THINK WE'RE

01:52:26.973 --> 01:52:28.308
PROBABLY GONNA BE ASKING

01:52:28.374 --> 01:52:29.742
QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT ON AN

01:52:29.809 --> 01:52:35.748
ONGOING BASIS. SO. WOULD YOU

01:52:35.815 --> 01:52:38.852
CARE TO COMMENT. YEAH SO WE USE

01:52:38.918 --> 01:52:40.687
A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT VENDORS

01:52:40.753 --> 01:52:41.554
FOR A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT

01:52:41.621 --> 01:52:44.991
SERVICES- THAT PRIOR CHAU- MET

01:52:45.058 --> 01:52:47.260
WITH VENDORS EVERY MONTHS TO

01:52:47.327 --> 01:52:49.429
LOOK AT THE LATEST- TECHNOLOGY

01:52:49.496 --> 01:52:51.631
WHAT THEY THEY BRING- JUST IN

01:52:51.698 --> 01:52:52.799
THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS WERE

01:52:52.866 --> 01:52:56.002
USING DOCUSIGN WERE USING- AND

01:52:56.069 --> 01:52:57.570
OUTSIDE VENDORS THROUGH C. D.

01:52:57.637 --> 01:52:59.906
T. IN ODI RECOMMENDATION FOR

01:52:59.973 --> 01:53:02.142
OUR CERTIFICATION REGISTER

01:53:02.208 --> 01:53:04.644
VACATIONS- WE'VE GOT A WHOLE

01:53:04.711 --> 01:53:06.279
HOST OF VENDORS I MEAN OUR

01:53:06.346 --> 01:53:08.148
SYSTEM ISN'T JUST. WHAT THE

01:53:08.214 --> 01:53:09.282
LATE BRING TO THE TABLE OUR

01:53:09.349 --> 01:53:12.252
SYSTEM AS A WHOLE HOST OF A

01:53:12.318 --> 01:53:14.854
BOLT ON SYSTEMS FROM NUMEROUS

01:53:14.921 --> 01:53:17.423
VENDORS THAT MAKE IT ALL WORK

01:53:17.490 --> 01:53:18.191
AND THAT'S PART OF THE BIG

01:53:18.258 --> 01:53:20.793
PROBLEM I UNDERSTAND YOUR

01:53:20.860 --> 01:53:21.995
CONCERN WITH THE LIGHT BUT I

01:53:22.061 --> 01:53:24.063
WILL ALSO SAY THEY GAVE US THEY

01:53:24.130 --> 01:53:25.498
BUILT A SYSTEM WHICH WAS A

01:53:25.565 --> 01:53:27.534
BUILT ON SYSTEM BASED ON WHAT

01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:29.969
AT THAT TIME. THE STATE OF

01:53:30.036 --> 01:53:31.104
CALIFORNIA WANTED TO DO AND

01:53:31.171 --> 01:53:32.705
WHICH WAS ONLY DO A PARTIAL

01:53:32.772 --> 01:53:34.574
REPLACEMENT I WOULD NEVER YOU

01:53:34.641 --> 01:53:36.209
KNOW AT THAT TIME TECHNOLOGY

01:53:36.276 --> 01:53:38.511
WISE I DON'T KNOW THAT WE THE

01:53:38.578 --> 01:53:39.612
ENVIRONMENT WAS ACTUALLY

01:53:39.679 --> 01:53:40.880
UNDERSTOOD WHAT A PARTIAL

01:53:40.947 --> 01:53:43.983
REPLACEMENT DOES. BUT YOU KNOW

01:53:44.050 --> 01:53:46.152
THAT'S WHY YOU KNOW WHY WE'RE

01:53:46.219 --> 01:53:47.554
LOOKING AT ALL THE WHOLESALE

01:53:47.620 --> 01:53:49.088
REPLACEMENT TO MAKE SURE WE GET

01:53:49.155 --> 01:53:51.958
AWAY FROM ALL THESE MULTAN'S-

01:53:52.025 --> 01:53:53.760
SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE TO PIECE

01:53:53.826 --> 01:53:55.395
TOGETHER IN ORDER TO MAKE UP

01:53:55.461 --> 01:53:56.796
THE U. I. SYSTEM AND MAKE SURE

01:53:56.863 --> 01:53:59.599
EVERYTHING STAYS IN SYNC. SO

01:53:59.666 --> 01:54:03.570
THEY. WERE GIVEN A TACIT WASN'T.

01:54:03.636 --> 01:54:04.737
IN IN MY IT. PROBABLY THE BEST

01:54:04.804 --> 01:54:06.573
STRATEGY BUT THAT'S WHAT WE

01:54:06.639 --> 01:54:08.208
KNEW AT THE TIME OR THAT THE

01:54:08.274 --> 01:54:10.109
LEAST THE LEADERS AT THE TIME.

01:54:10.176 --> 01:54:11.911
THEY JUST THOUGHT THAT- DOING A

01:54:11.978 --> 01:54:16.282
SMALLER TECHNOLOGY. ROSS SAYS-

01:54:16.349 --> 01:54:18.351
YOU KNOW WE'RE SOLUTION WAS A

01:54:18.418 --> 01:54:20.053
BETTER SITUATION THAN DOING A

01:54:20.119 --> 01:54:22.522
WHOLE A WHOLE LIST OF CHANGE

01:54:22.589 --> 01:54:23.690
AND I THINK WITH A LESSON

01:54:23.756 --> 01:54:24.924
LEARNED WE'VE ALL LEARNED.

01:54:24.991 --> 01:54:26.526
THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT THE WAY

01:54:26.593 --> 01:54:29.896
TO GO YOU LOSE THE BENEFIT OF A

01:54:29.963 --> 01:54:31.564
MODERNIZE SYSTEM THAT WORKS

01:54:31.631 --> 01:54:33.800
HOLISTICALLY- AND THAT'S WHAT

01:54:33.866 --> 01:54:35.235
WE DID WITH OUR TAX ACCOUNTING

01:54:35.301 --> 01:54:37.971
SYSTEM AND OUR TAX AREA. WE DID

01:54:38.037 --> 01:54:39.405
A WHOLESALE REPLACEMENT AND WE

01:54:39.472 --> 01:54:41.541
SEEN THE BENEFITS OF IT AND

01:54:41.608 --> 01:54:43.142
THAT IS EXACTLY WHY WE WERE

01:54:43.209 --> 01:54:44.310
LOOKING TO DO IT FOR OUR

01:54:44.377 --> 01:54:46.179
BENEFITS SYSTEM SO WE CAN. HAVE

01:54:46.246 --> 01:54:48.348
THE SAME SUCCESS IN OUR BENEFIT

01:54:48.414 --> 01:54:50.583
ROUND THAT WE HAD IN OUR TAX

01:54:50.650 --> 01:54:53.353
AROUND. SO ANYWAY YES WE'RE

01:54:53.419 --> 01:54:55.054
WE'RE USING IDEALIZING VENDORS

01:54:55.121 --> 01:54:56.289
ALL THE TIME THEIR NEW

01:54:56.356 --> 01:54:59.392
INNOVATIONS AND- SCREENING THE

01:54:59.459 --> 01:55:02.729
MARKET- I KNEW CHAU- TO START

01:55:02.795 --> 01:55:05.598
IN MARCH IS- FANTASTIC. AND IT

01:55:05.665 --> 01:55:07.400
BROUGHT EVEN MORE AND MORE

01:55:07.467 --> 01:55:10.103
IDEAS TO THE TABLE- WHICH HAS

01:55:10.169 --> 01:55:14.540
BEEN VERY EXCITING. BUT YEAH.

01:55:14.607 --> 01:55:16.876
TO LAST I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU

01:55:16.943 --> 01:55:18.578
A LITTLE WHILE AGO WHEN YOU

01:55:18.645 --> 01:55:19.345
WERE ANSWERING ONE OF THE

01:55:19.412 --> 01:55:21.414
QUESTIONS- HE SAID THAT THEY

01:55:21.481 --> 01:55:22.348
WOULD HAVE TO BE A QUESTION

01:55:22.415 --> 01:55:24.417
ABOUT. WHAT WE LOOK LIKE MOVING

01:55:24.484 --> 01:55:27.020
FORWARD. AND SO I WANT TO ASK

01:55:27.086 --> 01:55:29.856
YOU. GIVEN ALSO THESE NUMBERS

01:55:29.922 --> 01:55:33.526
GIVEN ALSO ALL THE HIRINGS THAT

01:55:33.593 --> 01:55:35.628
YOU ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN.

01:55:35.695 --> 01:55:37.964
YOU KNOW THERE'S A VERY.

01:55:38.031 --> 01:55:40.266
THERE'S BEEN A DELAYED RAMP UP

01:55:40.333 --> 01:55:41.968
AND A LOT OF THE CONCERNS HAVE

01:55:42.035 --> 01:55:45.204
HAVE THAT. HAVE LED TO NOW THIS

01:55:45.271 --> 01:55:47.240
RAMP UP WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE

01:55:47.307 --> 01:55:48.441
BECAUSE YOU WOULD HAVE HOPED

01:55:48.508 --> 01:55:50.977
THAT THE DEMAND WOULD HAVE BEEN

01:55:51.044 --> 01:55:53.880
MET. BUT THERE'S BEEN A DELAY

01:55:53.946 --> 01:55:55.348
VERY DELAYED MEETING OF THE

01:55:55.415 --> 01:55:56.916
DEMAND AND THERE'S BEEN QUITE A

01:55:56.983 --> 01:56:00.119
BIT OF HIRING OF NEW STAFF. NOW

01:56:00.186 --> 01:56:02.989
AT SOME POINT AS THE CONCERNS

01:56:03.056 --> 01:56:05.491
DECRESCENDO AND THAT MIGHT BE.

01:56:05.558 --> 01:56:08.394
SOMETIME AWAY BECAUSE I THINK

01:56:08.461 --> 01:56:08.995
THE WORST OF THIS RECESSION IS

01:56:09.062 --> 01:56:14.567
YET TO HIT. WHAT IS. WHAT'S

01:56:14.634 --> 01:56:16.903
WHAT'S THE PLAN FOR EDT MOVING

01:56:16.969 --> 01:56:18.438
FORWARD ARE WE JUST GOING TO

01:56:18.504 --> 01:56:21.941
HAVE A HIGHER LOAD OF EMPLOYEES

01:56:22.008 --> 01:56:23.810
IS IT ALL GOING TO SUBSIDE AT

01:56:23.876 --> 01:56:25.278
SOME POINT OR WHAT DOES THE

01:56:25.345 --> 01:56:27.313
AGENCY LOOK LIKE AND THIS IS

01:56:27.380 --> 01:56:29.015
OBVIOUSLY AN ONGOING COMIC THIS

01:56:29.082 --> 01:56:30.483
IS GOING TO BE AN ONGOING

01:56:30.550 --> 01:56:32.785
CONVERSATION BUT I FEEL LIKE

01:56:32.852 --> 01:56:33.386
IT'S IMPORTANT TO BRING IT UP

01:56:33.453 --> 01:56:36.055
BECAUSE- WHETHER IT'S BECAUSE-

01:56:36.122 --> 01:56:38.725
OF THE SHORTNESS. OF THE

01:56:38.791 --> 01:56:40.360
ELECTED OFFICIALS LIMITS. TERM

01:56:40.426 --> 01:56:43.596
LIMITS. OR WHATEVER ELSE IS A

01:56:43.663 --> 01:56:47.400
CONTRIBUTING FACTOR- IT IT

01:56:47.467 --> 01:56:53.740
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE ISSUES. THE

01:56:53.806 --> 01:56:54.974
EIGHT INSTITUTIONAL MEMORY

01:56:55.041 --> 01:56:57.176
SUPPORTS THERE BEING LONG TERM

01:56:57.243 --> 01:56:59.445
DISCUSSIONS OF HOW THE ISSUES

01:56:59.512 --> 01:57:02.648
GET RESOLVED. SO IF ANYTHING I

01:57:02.715 --> 01:57:04.250
WANT THIS TO BE THE START TO

01:57:04.317 --> 01:57:06.085
FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU TELL US

01:57:06.152 --> 01:57:09.455

HOW WHERE ARE THE CHANGES YOU

01:57:16.062 --> 01:57:18.865
SEE. THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:57:18.931 --> 01:57:20.099
IMPLEMENTED FOR THE AGENCY

01:57:20.166 --> 01:57:25.872
MOVING FORWARD. I WOULDN'T MIND

01:57:25.938 --> 01:57:27.073
IF YOU OFFER SOME THOUGHTS

01:57:27.140 --> 01:57:28.541
RIGHT NOW AND WE CAN CONTINUE

01:57:28.608 --> 01:57:32.211
TALKING. DEFINITELY I MEAN AT

01:57:32.278 --> 01:57:33.746

THE CALL CENTER BE RESPONDING

01:57:36.048 --> 01:57:38.084
TO EVERYBODY THAT NEEDS HELP. I

01:57:38.151 --> 01:57:40.319
WOULD LOVE TO USE EVERY FEATURE

01:57:40.386 --> 01:57:41.721
IN TECHNOLOGY THERE IS OUT

01:57:41.788 --> 01:57:43.222
THERE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE

01:57:43.289 --> 01:57:45.091
DIFFERENT- VEHICLES AND AVENUES

01:57:45.158 --> 01:57:47.059
FOR SERVICE. I LIKE ALL OF OUR

01:57:47.126 --> 01:57:49.262
INFORMATION TO BE IS CLEAR AND

01:57:49.328 --> 01:57:50.830
UNDERSTANDABLE AND DIGESTIBLE

01:57:50.897 --> 01:57:53.466
BY ALL WHICH IS IT A HUGE

01:57:53.533 --> 01:57:54.700
CHALLENGE GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY

01:57:54.767 --> 01:57:56.736
OF THE FEDERAL PROGRAM. IT JUST

01:57:56.803 --> 01:57:57.603
SEEMS TO GET MORE AND MORE

01:57:57.670 --> 01:58:01.741
COMPLEX. SO I'D YOU KNOW I WANT

01:58:01.808 --> 01:58:03.042
TO BE A DIRECTOR OF A

01:58:03.109 --> 01:58:05.011
DEPARTMENT WHERE MY STAFF. ARE

01:58:05.077 --> 01:58:07.280
SO PROUD OF THE SERVICES WERE

01:58:07.346 --> 01:58:08.815
PROVIDING BECAUSE WE KNOW WE'RE

01:58:08.881 --> 01:58:10.950
GIVING THAT TOP NOT SERVICE TO

01:58:11.017 --> 01:58:12.819
CALIFORNIANS. THAT'S WHERE WE

01:58:12.885 --> 01:58:14.821
NEED TO BE AND I THINK THAT'S

01:58:14.887 --> 01:58:16.422
WHERE WE'RE GOING WITH THE HELP

01:58:16.489 --> 01:58:19.926
OF A CD T. ODI THE STRIKE TEAM.

01:58:19.992 --> 01:58:21.861
THE GOVERNOR ADDITIONAL

01:58:21.928 --> 01:58:24.964
APPOINTEES- IT TAKES MANPOWER

01:58:25.031 --> 01:58:26.966
AND IT TAKES- GOOD PEOPLE AT

01:58:27.033 --> 01:58:28.968
THE TABLE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT

01:58:29.035 --> 01:58:30.937
CHANGES AND THE WILLINGNESS TO

01:58:31.003 --> 01:58:34.407
FIND IT. SO I THINK YOU KNOW

01:58:34.474 --> 01:58:35.808
IT'S NOT GOOD THAT WERE IN THE

01:58:35.875 --> 01:58:37.376
LIMELIGHT BUT BEING IN THE

01:58:37.443 --> 01:58:39.111
LIMELIGHT DOES A PRESENT

01:58:39.178 --> 01:58:41.614
OPPORTUNITIES FOR GREAT GREAT

01:58:41.681 --> 01:58:46.319
IMPROVEMENT. SO MAYBE THAT'S

01:58:46.385 --> 01:58:46.919
NOT THE WAY YOU WANT TO DO IT

01:58:46.986 --> 01:58:48.454
BUT IT IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:58:48.521 --> 01:58:50.857
REALLY STRIVE AND MAKE CHANGES

01:58:50.923 --> 01:58:53.125
AND GREAT PARTNERSHIP SO. I

01:58:53.192 --> 01:58:54.460
WELCOME IT. WE NEED TO BE

01:58:54.527 --> 01:58:58.064
DIFFERENT. MY COMMENTS ARE

01:58:58.130 --> 01:58:59.232
PARTIALLY BECAUSE OF THE FACT

01:58:59.298 --> 01:58:59.966
THAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS

01:59:00.032 --> 01:59:01.834
ONCE BEFORE AND I WOULD HAVE

01:59:01.901 --> 01:59:02.835
THOUGHT I THINK MOST OF US

01:59:02.902 --> 01:59:04.437
WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT WHAT

01:59:04.504 --> 01:59:06.272
ARE STATE WAS CHALLENGED WITH

01:59:06.339 --> 01:59:07.206
OVER A LITTLE OVER TEN YEARS

01:59:07.273 --> 01:59:10.843
