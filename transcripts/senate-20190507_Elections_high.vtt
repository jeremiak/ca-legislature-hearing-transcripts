GRANDCHILDREN THAT INHERITED

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.491
FROM A HOME TO ACTUALLY LIVE IN

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:00.193
THE HOME IN ORDER TO KEEP THEIR

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.061
PROP THIRTEEN BASE YEAR.

00:01:02.128 --> 00:01:03.496
AND TO AVOID REASSESSMENT.

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:05.398
CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE IN

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:07.066
THE COUNTRY THAT ALLOWS PARENTS

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:19.846
IT SEEMS BLATANTLY UNFAIR THAT

THE HOME IT WOULD.

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:48.975

HOWEVER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SHOULD

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:09.095

THE CHILD DOESN'T LIVE IN THE

THIS BILL IT'S KIND OF A

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:57.483

DRAMATIC PROPERTY TAX INCREASE

00:07:28.681 --> 00:07:30.750

FAIRNESS EXISTING LAW HAS

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.202
ENABLED A MINORITY OF VOTERS. TO

BLOCK EFFORTS TO PROVIDE VITAL

00:11:12.238 --> 00:11:14.006

MAJORITY THAT WOULD RULE.

00:11:28.387 --> 00:11:29.522

IT MAY SEEM A REMEDY.

00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:40.699

BALLOT GENERAL USE TAXES FOR A

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.581
**** WITH A MAJORITY VOTE --

00:13:02.648 --> 00:13:04.683
THIS IS THE ONLY THING THAT'S AT

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.185
THE DISPOSAL OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:13:06.252 --> 00:13:08.521
TO ACTUALLY RAISE MONEY LOCALLY

00:13:08.587 --> 00:13:11.423
THROUGH -- YOU KNOW -- THE AT

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:12.158
THE DAY GOES RIGHT TO THE

00:13:12.224 --> 00:13:13.959
GENERAL FUND IN ORDER TO BUILD

00:13:14.026 --> 00:13:15.961
NEW BUILDINGS I WILL YOU KNOW

00:13:16.028 --> 00:13:17.563
THAT IN THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.566
THAT IS A 55% VOTE FOR BONDS.

00:13:20.633 --> 00:13:22.268
THAT WAS DONE STATEWIDE A WHILE

00:13:22.334 --> 00:13:23.302
BACK -- BUT WHEN IT COMES TO

00:13:23.369 --> 00:13:24.703
ACTUALLY TRY TO RAISE MONEY FOR

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:26.472
THE GENERAL FUND WHICH IS WHAT --

00:13:26.539 --> 00:13:28.374
YOU NEED TO OPERATE AN

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.441
INSTITUTION LIKE A SCHOOL

00:13:29.508 --> 00:13:31.710
DISTRICT I THE ONLY LOCAL OPTION

00:13:31.777 --> 00:13:33.512
THAT YOU HAVE BESIDES PRIVATE

00:13:33.579 --> 00:13:34.847
SECTOR PHILANTHROPY.

00:13:34.914 --> 00:13:37.583
IS -- IS IS IS THIS PARCEL TAX

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:38.918
AND I THINK IT'S AN IMPERFECT

00:13:38.984 --> 00:13:39.318
SYSTEM.

00:13:39.385 --> 00:13:41.854
BUT UNTIL WE DO AN OVERHAUL OF

00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:43.889
THE WAY WE FUND SCHOOLS -- THIS

00:13:43.956 --> 00:13:46.025
IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF OF OF

00:13:46.091 --> 00:13:47.459
THE OF THE MATRIX WE MADE A

00:13:47.526 --> 00:13:48.661
MAJOR DECISION A COUPLE YEARS

00:13:48.727 --> 00:13:50.229
AGO TO TOTALLY REVAMP THE WAY WE

00:13:50.296 --> 00:13:51.764
FINANCE SCHOOLS.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:54.033
IN THE STATE TO HAVE TO REDIRECT

00:13:54.099 --> 00:13:55.801
FUNDING BASED ON LEVELS OF

00:13:55.868 --> 00:13:59.872
POVERTY AND POCKETS OF POVERTY

00:13:59.939 --> 00:14:02.741
AND CONCENTRATIONS OF POVERTY IN.

00:14:02.808 --> 00:14:03.842
AT THE END THAT THAT THAT LED TO

00:14:03.909 --> 00:14:04.643
SOME PRETTY DRAMATIC CHANGES TO

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:05.211
THE WAY WE FINANCE SCHOOLS.

00:14:05.277 --> 00:14:06.412
BEFORE I THINK THERE WAS A

00:14:06.478 --> 00:14:07.613
CONCERN THERE THERE'S A SERIES

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.014
OF EQUITY CONCERNS ABOUT

00:14:09.081 --> 00:14:10.282
LOWERING THE YOU KNOW ABOUT

00:14:10.349 --> 00:14:11.817
RELYING TOO MUCH ON PROPERTY ON

00:14:11.884 --> 00:14:13.686
BY PERSONAL TAXES BUT WITH WITH

00:14:13.752 --> 00:14:15.154
THIS NEW VERY STRONGLY

00:14:15.221 --> 00:14:16.255
REDISTRIBUTIVE MODEL THAT WE

00:14:16.322 --> 00:14:17.456
HAVE I THINK SOME OF THOSE

00:14:17.523 --> 00:14:19.291
EQUITY CONCERNS ARE NOW -- MUCH

00:14:19.358 --> 00:14:21.894
LESSER -- ON THE ON THE ON THE

00:14:21.961 --> 00:14:23.662
ON THE FRONT BURNER AND AND THIS

00:14:23.729 --> 00:14:25.331
IS AN OPPORTUNE THIS IS A WAY TO

00:14:25.397 --> 00:14:26.498
GET MORE MONEY INTO OUR SCHOOL

00:14:26.565 --> 00:14:27.032
SYSTEM.

00:14:27.099 --> 00:14:29.034
AND AND IN IN THE END OF THE DAY --

00:14:29.101 --> 00:14:30.869
IT'S REALLY ABOUT HOLDING FAITH

00:14:30.936 --> 00:14:32.137
BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND SCHOOL

00:14:32.204 --> 00:14:33.872

VERY STRONG MARGIN IT'S NOT AN

00:15:02.501 --> 00:15:04.436
EASY MARGIN TO MAKE -- BUT IT

00:15:04.503 --> 00:15:05.904
IT'S MUCH MORE REASONABLE THAN

00:15:05.971 --> 00:15:07.306
WHAT THE CURRENT RULES SPECIFY

00:15:07.373 --> 00:15:08.774

THE ARGUMENTS BEEN MADE HERE AT

THAT THE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE AN

00:21:21.813 --> 00:21:23.682

EXPECTED TO CONTINUE.

00:21:36.294 --> 00:21:37.829
ALRIGHT MR MAY FILL IN THE GAPS

00:21:37.896 --> 00:21:39.364
HERE A LITTLE BIT ON SOME OF THE

00:21:39.431 --> 00:21:41.066
OTHER ARGUMENTS BUT YOU KNOW

00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:42.534
JUST TO MAKE THE POINT FINALLY

00:21:42.601 --> 00:21:44.569
THAT PERSONAL TAXES ARE VERY

00:21:44.636 --> 00:21:44.870
REGRESSIVE.

00:21:44.936 --> 00:21:46.238
WHY DO YOU OWN A ONE BEDROOM

00:21:46.304 --> 00:21:47.305
HOUSE OR A MILLION DOLLAR

00:21:47.372 --> 00:21:49.141

OF DOLLARS TO BILLS YEAR MAKING

00:22:02.554 --> 00:22:03.855
IT MORE EXPENSIVE TO AFFORD

00:22:03.922 --> 00:22:09.861
HOMES SELL FOR ALL THESE REASONS

00:22:09.928 --> 00:22:12.698
FOR ASK FOR AN OF A THEY GIVE US

00:22:12.764 --> 00:22:13.331
TWELVE OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. TO

00:22:13.398 --> 00:22:13.932
RESTORE MAY REPRESENTING THE

00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:14.900
CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION

00:22:14.966 --> 00:22:15.867
GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND

00:22:15.934 --> 00:22:16.735
MEMBERS.

00:22:16.802 --> 00:22:17.369
WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE DESIRE

00:22:17.436 --> 00:22:19.538
FOR A QUALITY EDUCATION WE HAVE

00:22:19.604 --> 00:22:20.706
THREE PRIMARY CONCERNS WITH THIS

00:22:20.772 --> 00:22:22.607
BILL THE FIRST CONCERN IS THIS

00:22:22.674 --> 00:22:24.142
BILL WOULD FACILITATE TAX

00:22:24.209 --> 00:22:25.944
INCREASES THAT THEN RESULT IN

00:22:26.011 --> 00:22:27.279
HIGHER HOUSING COSTS FOR

00:22:27.345 --> 00:22:28.380
CALIFORNIANS.

00:22:28.447 --> 00:22:30.449
BOTH IN TERMS OF HOMEOWNERS THAT

00:22:30.515 --> 00:22:32.951
THEN CAN BE.

00:22:33.018 --> 00:22:34.686
CALIFORNIA HAS THE TENTH HIGHEST

00:22:34.753 --> 00:22:36.188
PROPERTY TAX BURDEN IN THE

00:22:36.254 --> 00:22:37.656
NATION AND THIS BILL BY

00:22:37.723 --> 00:22:39.391
FACILITATING PARTIAL TAX

00:22:39.458 --> 00:22:41.326
INCREASES WOULD MAKE THAT

00:22:41.393 --> 00:22:42.427
PROBLEM EVEN WORSE THE

00:22:42.494 --> 00:22:43.895
LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR

00:22:43.962 --> 00:22:44.996
HAVE TALKED ABOUT HOW TO MAKE

00:22:45.063 --> 00:22:46.498
CALIFORNIA HOUSING MORE

00:22:46.565 --> 00:22:47.232
AFFORDABLE.

00:22:47.299 --> 00:22:48.600
THIS TAKES US IN THE WRONG

00:22:48.667 --> 00:22:50.535
DIRECTION MAKING CALIFORNIA LESS

00:22:50.602 --> 00:22:52.304
AFFORDABLE FOR ALL.

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:54.039
OUR SECOND CONCERN IS THAT A

00:22:54.106 --> 00:22:55.707
CHANGE TO THE VOTE THRESHOLD IS

00:22:55.774 --> 00:22:57.209
NOT NECESSARY.

00:22:57.275 --> 00:22:59.111
CURRENTLY BASED ON HISTORICAL

00:22:59.177 --> 00:23:02.914
DATA BASED ON THE CITY FINANCES

00:23:02.981 --> 00:23:04.015
AND THE LOADER.

00:23:04.082 --> 00:23:05.717
SKEWS ME THE LOCAL VOTER BALLOT

00:23:05.784 --> 00:23:08.120
MEASURE 75% OF ALL LOCAL TAXES

00:23:08.186 --> 00:23:09.454
HAVE PASSED AND THAT'S GOING

00:23:09.521 --> 00:23:11.790
HISTORICALLY ALL THE WAY BACK TO

00:23:11.857 --> 00:23:14.025
THE EARLY. NINETEEN SEVENTIES

00:23:14.092 --> 00:23:16.962
ALL THE WAY TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN

00:23:17.028 --> 00:23:17.462
IN THE MOST RECENT LOCAL

00:23:17.529 --> 00:23:19.498
ELECTIONS -- ALSO SCHOOLS

00:23:19.564 --> 00:23:22.067
ALREADY HAVE A SPECIAL CARVE OUT.

00:23:22.134 --> 00:23:24.236
FOR SPECIAL TAXES LOCAL CITIES

00:23:24.302 --> 00:23:26.204
AND COUNTIES ARE REQUIRED. TO

00:23:26.271 --> 00:23:28.206
PASS VOTE TO PASS WITH A TWO

00:23:28.273 --> 00:23:30.342
THIRDS VOTE BUT CURRENTLY SCHOOL

DISTRICTS ALREADY HAVE A 55%

00:23:32.577 --> 00:23:34.346
CARVE OUT FOR SCHOOL BONDS THE

00:23:34.412 --> 00:23:36.181
LAW IN THE VOTE THRESHOLD IS NOT

00:23:36.248 --> 00:23:38.316
NECESSARY AND ALSO IT PUTS LOCAL

00:23:38.383 --> 00:23:41.419
CITIES AND COUNTIES AT A

00:23:41.486 --> 00:23:42.854
POTENTIAL DISADVANTAGE.

00:23:42.921 --> 00:23:43.488
LANCE.

00:23:43.555 --> 00:23:44.156
THE LAST CONCERN THAT WE HAVE IS

00:23:44.222 --> 00:23:45.390
ACCORDING TO THE PUBLIC POLICY

00:23:45.457 --> 00:23:46.691

CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS -- BUT

00:26:39.631 --> 00:26:41.766
BUT RIGHT NOW THE LAW SAYS THAT

00:26:41.833 --> 00:26:42.834
IT'S UP TO THE SCHOOL BOARD TO

00:26:42.901 --> 00:26:43.435
MAKE THAT.

00:26:43.501 --> 00:26:45.337
JUDGMENT CALL AS TO HOW IT

00:26:45.403 --> 00:26:46.972
STRUCTURES THE THE THE THE

00:26:47.038 --> 00:26:49.507
EXPENDITURES AFTERWARDS AND THAT --

00:26:49.574 --> 00:26:51.943
IT'S AT THE DISCRETION OF THE

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:53.378
LOCAL DISTRICT YEAH OF COURSE.

00:26:53.445 --> 00:26:55.246

THE CHARTER FOLKS SO AS TO BE

00:27:00.452 --> 00:27:02.087
ABLE TO HAVE A STRONG COALITION

00:27:02.153 --> 00:27:03.154
OF SUPPORT.

00:27:03.221 --> 00:27:04.422
THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE DONE IN WITH

00:27:04.489 --> 00:27:07.592
MEASURE E. IN LOS ANGELES BUT

00:27:07.659 --> 00:27:09.627
RIGHT NOW UNDER THE LAW IT'S

00:27:09.694 --> 00:27:12.797
IT'S A DECISION THAT IS NOT PART

00:27:12.864 --> 00:27:15.033

SO DO.

00:27:26.945 --> 00:27:27.746
I I SUPPOSE THIS IS GILDING THE

00:27:27.812 --> 00:27:28.346
LILY SO IS PERMISSIVE BUT NOT

00:27:28.413 --> 00:27:31.016
REQUIRED.

PUTTING BEFORE THE VOTERS --

00:27:39.691 --> 00:27:42.560
OTHER QUESTIONS.

MAY IF IF IF YOU WILL YOU IT

00:27:46.664 --> 00:27:47.732
WOULD SAID THAT THIS MEASURE

00:27:47.799 --> 00:27:48.933
WOULD PUT CITIES AND COUNTIES AT

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.568
A DISADVANTAGE I'M CURIOUS AS TO

00:27:50.635 --> 00:27:51.569
HOW THAT.

00:27:51.636 --> 00:27:55.507
HOW THAT WORKS?

00:27:55.573 --> 00:27:56.775
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR UNDER

00:27:56.841 --> 00:27:57.876
CURRENT CONSTITUTIONAL

SCHOOL DISTRICT TO PASS A

00:28:03.815 --> 00:28:06.518
SPECIAL TAX THE VOTE THRESHOLD

00:28:10.055 --> 00:28:11.022
TAX.

00:28:11.089 --> 00:28:14.726
LOWERING THAT 255% MEANS THAT

00:28:14.793 --> 00:28:16.194
WHEN IT'S ON THE SAME BALLOT.

00:28:16.261 --> 00:28:18.863
SHOULD A TAXPAYER PICK AGAINST

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:20.899
ATTACKS THAT IS A TWO THIRDS

00:28:20.965 --> 00:28:23.535
VOTE OR 55% VOTE A LOT OF TIMES

00:28:23.601 --> 00:28:26.037
THERE'S WHAT'S CALLED TAX OF TAX

00:28:26.104 --> 00:28:27.338
TOLERANCE VOTER TOLERANCE.

00:28:27.405 --> 00:28:28.873
AND WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:30.375
THERE COULD BE TAXES FOR

00:28:30.442 --> 00:28:32.444
TRANSPORTATION THAT IS A SPECIAL

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:34.279
DESIGNATED TAX REQUIRING TWO

00:28:34.345 --> 00:28:36.014
THIRDS VOTE VERSUS A SPECIAL

00:28:36.081 --> 00:28:37.615
DESIGNATED TAX FOR SCHOOLS ONE

00:28:37.682 --> 00:28:40.752
IS THAT. TWO THIRDS AND ONE IS A

00:28:40.819 --> 00:28:43.388
55%.

00:28:43.455 --> 00:28:45.690
ALL RIGHT I SEE CENTER AL LOOKS

00:28:45.757 --> 00:28:46.758
LIKE HE WAS UP ON RIGHT AND WITH

00:28:46.825 --> 00:28:49.294
WITH SO MUCH RESPECT I I I I I

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:50.595
WOULD.

00:28:50.662 --> 00:28:51.596
ANY CITY MANAGER WORTH HIS SALT

00:28:51.663 --> 00:28:52.363
BECAUSE OF THE WAY OUR CURRENT

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:55.200
STRUCTURE AT EXIT EIGHTEEN YEAH

00:28:55.266 --> 00:28:56.367
BECAUSE THE CURRENT STRUCTURE.

00:28:56.434 --> 00:28:57.702
I THEY WOULDN'T GO FOR SPECIAL

00:28:57.769 --> 00:28:59.704
TAX TO GO FOR A GENERAL SALES

00:28:59.771 --> 00:29:02.340
AND USE TAXES ONLY REQUIRES A A

00:29:02.407 --> 00:29:04.109
50% PLUS.

00:29:04.175 --> 00:29:06.044
ONE VOTE -- SO IN THIS CASE

00:29:06.111 --> 00:29:07.645
STILL THE SCHOOLS WOULD BE

00:29:07.712 --> 00:29:08.813
DISADVANTAGED BECAUSE LEASE

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:11.249
WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT A 55%

00:29:11.316 --> 00:29:12.383
THRESHOLD AS OPPOSED TO MAJORITY --

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:15.053
THRESHOLD SO I I AGREE WITH YOU

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.588
WITH REGARDS TO AND HOW THE

00:29:16.654 --> 00:29:18.022
SUBJECT OPPOSED TO IT TO A

00:29:18.089 --> 00:29:20.091
SPECIAL TAX BUT BUT BUT THE THE

00:29:20.158 --> 00:29:21.759
SALES AND USE TAX FOR GENERAL

00:29:21.826 --> 00:29:23.294
FUND PURPOSES IS SUCH A OF AN

00:29:23.361 --> 00:29:24.295
EASIER THRESHOLD THAT MANY

00:29:24.362 --> 00:29:25.396
CITIES ARE NOW AVAILING

00:29:25.463 --> 00:29:26.598
THEMSELVES OF THAT OPTION.

00:29:26.664 --> 00:29:27.632
AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE

00:29:27.699 --> 00:29:29.367
FAIR COMPARISON AND IN THAT

00:29:29.434 --> 00:29:31.169
COMPARISON THE SCHOOLS WOULD

00:29:31.236 --> 00:29:32.003
STILL BE DISADVANTAGED UNDER

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:33.705
THIS.

00:29:33.771 --> 00:29:39.210
I SCA WAS C. MISTEL MAY OF THE

00:29:39.277 --> 00:29:40.178
OF GIVE YOU THE LAST WORD OUR

00:29:40.245 --> 00:29:41.179
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THERE IS

00:29:41.246 --> 00:29:41.813
QUITE A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:42.747
GENERAL TAXES AND SPECIAL TAXES

00:29:42.814 --> 00:29:43.781
AS WE KNOW A LOT OF TIMES JUST.

00:29:43.848 --> 00:29:45.016
EIGHT GENERAL TAX ALTHOUGH IT IS

00:29:45.083 --> 00:29:48.553
A 50% MAJORITY VOTE -- BECAUSE

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.054
IT DOESN'T GO TO A SPECIFIC

00:29:50.121 --> 00:29:52.123
PURPOSE VOTERS ARE LESS LIKELY

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:53.791
IF THEY DON'T SEE THE RESULT IN

00:29:53.858 --> 00:29:55.293
A NEW ROAD.

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.162
AND YOU KNOW -- NEW STREET

00:29:57.228 --> 00:29:58.463
LIGHTS OR WHATEVER.

00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:00.465
IF THE PURPOSE IS NOTSPECIFIED

00:30:00.532 --> 00:30:01.633
THERE'S LESS CHANCE FOR THE

00:30:01.699 --> 00:30:03.334
VOTER TO BE INCLINED TO VOTE FOR

00:30:03.401 --> 00:30:05.003
THAT ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE ARE

00:30:05.069 --> 00:30:06.804
OTHER COMPETING TAXES ON THE

00:30:06.871 --> 00:30:07.038
BALLOT.

00:30:07.105 --> 00:30:08.606

IS ABOUT EQUITY AND YOU KNOW

00:30:25.657 --> 00:30:27.125
MISTER WOLF MENTIONED THAT TO

00:30:27.192 --> 00:30:27.725
TWO TWO THIRDS VOTE ASSURES.

00:30:27.792 --> 00:30:28.560

MINORITY.

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:34.065
pTHE MAJORITY THAT'S NOT WHAT OUR

OUR DEMOCRACY IS ABOUT THE

00:30:36.968 --> 00:30:38.269
MINORITY SOULD NOT BE MAKING

00:30:38.336 --> 00:30:39.637
THOSE DECISIONS.

MAJORITY STATES DON'T

OFFICE -- THE FRAMERS -- THOUGH

00:32:26.344 --> 00:32:28.012
HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE FRAMERS

00:32:28.079 --> 00:32:29.147
THE RECALL.

00:32:29.213 --> 00:32:30.748
YOU KNOW THEY WANTED THERE TO BE

00:32:30.815 --> 00:32:32.216
THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR VOTERS TO

00:32:32.283 --> 00:32:34.485
WEIGH IN BUT BUT IT BUT IF YOU

00:32:34.552 --> 00:32:36.020
LOOK AT THE ORIGINAL INTENT.

00:32:36.087 --> 00:32:37.322
AND AND THE DISCUSSIONS AND

00:32:37.388 --> 00:32:39.991
DEBATES OVER THE FRAMING OF OUR

00:32:40.058 --> 00:32:41.192
RECALL RULES.

00:32:41.259 --> 00:32:43.061
I THAT THE FRAMERS DID WANTED TO

00:32:43.127 --> 00:32:44.962
BE A TOOL THAT WAS WAS ONLY USE

00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:45.396
UNDER EXTRAORDINARY

00:32:45.463 --> 00:32:46.931
CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:32:46.998 --> 00:32:48.433
AND AND IT TIGHTLY TALKED ABOUT

00:32:48.499 --> 00:32:50.735
MALFEASANCE IN A AND CORRUPTION

00:32:50.802 --> 00:32:54.605
AND AND AND THAT SORT OF THING.

00:32:54.672 --> 00:32:55.573
NOW.

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:56.240
I THINK THERE BEEN SOME CONCERNS

00:32:56.307 --> 00:32:58.142
RAISED RECALLS HAVE BEEN USED

00:32:58.209 --> 00:32:59.243
BOTH AGAINST.

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:02.180
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS --

00:33:02.246 --> 00:33:03.314
SOMETIMES AROUND ONE VOTE --

00:33:03.381 --> 00:33:06.184
THAT CAN LEAD TO ABUSES BY WELL

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:08.386
FINANCE SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS --

00:33:08.453 --> 00:33:09.854
ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS

00:33:09.921 --> 00:33:11.456
THOUGH -- IS A IS ABOUT THE

00:33:11.522 --> 00:33:12.490
MECHANICS.

00:33:12.557 --> 00:33:13.558
AND THAT'S THE FACT THAT WE HAVE

00:33:13.624 --> 00:33:15.393
THIS VOTER CONFUSION ASSOCIATED

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:17.028
WITH THIS TWO PART QUESTION

00:33:17.095 --> 00:33:17.862
ANYBODY WHO WAS INVOLVED WITH

00:33:17.929 --> 00:33:19.530
THE JEFF DENHAM OR THE JOSH

00:33:19.597 --> 00:33:20.565
NEWMAN.

00:33:20.631 --> 00:33:21.699
I RECALL CAMPAIGN OR THE OR THE

00:33:21.766 --> 00:33:23.267
GRAY DAVIS RECALL CAMPAIGNS

00:33:23.334 --> 00:33:25.169
REMEMBER THAT IT WAS VERY

00:33:25.236 --> 00:33:26.437
DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN A LOT OF

00:33:26.504 --> 00:33:28.906
VOTERS DIDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND

00:33:28.973 --> 00:33:29.507
THE FACT THAT THEY WERE VOTING

00:33:29.574 --> 00:33:30.341
TWICE.

00:33:30.408 --> 00:33:32.043
I IN FACT IN THE RECENT RECALL

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:33.911
DOWN.

00:33:33.978 --> 00:33:35.413
IN ORANGE COUNTY -- THERE WAS A

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:39.150
A 30% DIFFERENCE A 30% DROP IN

00:33:39.217 --> 00:33:41.619
THOSE WHO VOTED ON QUESTION ONE

00:33:41.686 --> 00:33:43.855
VERSUS QUESTION TOO SO 30% LESS.

00:33:43.921 --> 00:33:46.324
OF THE VOTERS -- VOTED ON

00:33:46.391 --> 00:33:50.194
QUESTION TWO VERSES QUESTION.

00:33:50.261 --> 00:33:51.362
ONE NOW I AND AND THIS LEADS TO

00:33:51.429 --> 00:33:52.964
A CRAZY SYSTEM THAT WE CURRENTLY

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:53.564
HAVE UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM

00:33:53.631 --> 00:33:54.966
MEMBERS.

00:33:55.032 --> 00:33:56.634
IT IS IT IS [inaudible]

00:33:56.701 --> 00:33:58.403
A FREQUENT.

00:33:58.469 --> 00:34:01.239
THAT I A MEMBER THAT THAT THAT

00:34:01.305 --> 00:34:03.841
THAT THAT SOMEBODY ENDS UP --

00:34:03.908 --> 00:34:06.577
WITH MORE VOTES. TO KEEP THE

00:34:06.644 --> 00:34:08.112
INCUMBENT IN OFFICE.

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:10.148
THEN THE PERSON WHO.

00:34:10.214 --> 00:34:12.683
IS A REPLACEMENT CANDIDATE SO SO

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:14.919
THE THE MORE PEOPLE WHO VOTED NO

00:34:14.986 --> 00:34:16.687
ON THE RECALL.

00:34:16.754 --> 00:34:18.356
THEN THE PERSON WHO ACTUALLY END

00:34:18.423 --> 00:34:19.657
UP REPLACING THE SITTING

00:34:19.724 --> 00:34:21.159
INCUMBENT.

00:34:21.225 --> 00:34:24.195
AFTER THE ELECTION.

00:34:24.262 --> 00:34:25.296
YOU KNOW I'D GET.

00:34:25.363 --> 00:34:26.063
YOU IF THEM PROBABLY ALL OF US

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:27.565
WOULD BE TURFED OUT OF OFFICE IF

00:34:27.632 --> 00:34:28.900
IF IT WAS IF WE WERE RUNNING

00:34:28.966 --> 00:34:30.101
AGAINST KIND OF A HYPOTHETICAL

00:34:30.168 --> 00:34:31.469
PERFECT CANDIDATE BUT THE FACT

00:34:31.536 --> 00:34:32.837
IS MEMBERS YOU ALL KNOW THAT WE

00:34:32.904 --> 00:34:33.871
ALL HAVE TO RUN FOR OFFICE

00:34:33.938 --> 00:34:35.273
AGAINST REAL PEOPLE.

00:34:35.339 --> 00:34:36.441
AND VOTERS AFTER ACTION MAKE A

00:34:36.507 --> 00:34:38.643
REAL CHOICE BETWEEN REAL PEOPLE

00:34:38.709 --> 00:34:40.044
AND PERFECT AS WE ALL ARE.

00:34:40.111 --> 00:34:42.246
AND THAT'S WHY YOU KNOW A

00:34:42.313 --> 00:34:43.815
PRESIDENTIAL DISAPPROVAL

00:34:43.881 --> 00:34:45.416
APPROVAL RATING IS IS IS A

00:34:45.483 --> 00:34:46.918
FEMORAL AND AND NOT THAT

00:34:46.984 --> 00:34:47.852
INSTRUCTED YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY

00:34:47.919 --> 00:34:49.654
FIND OUT HOW DOES THAT PRESIDENT

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:50.855
HOW DOES THAT GOVERNOR HOW DOES

00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:51.989
THAT LEGISLATOR ACTUALLY PAIR UP

00:34:52.056 --> 00:34:52.457
AGAINST.

00:34:52.523 --> 00:34:54.425
A POTENTIAL RIVAL A POTENTIAL --

00:34:54.492 --> 00:34:57.728
AN ACTUAL POTENTIAL A CANDIDATE.

00:34:57.795 --> 00:34:59.664
AND O THAT'S THE CRAZINESS OF

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:01.032
OUR CURRENT SYSTEM IS THAT WE

00:35:01.098 --> 00:35:03.734
NOW ALLOW WE NOW HAVE A SYSTEM

00:35:03.801 --> 00:35:04.869
WHEREBY.

00:35:04.936 --> 00:35:07.171
WE REPLACE AN INCUMBENT WITH

00:35:07.238 --> 00:35:09.207
SOMEBODY WHO OFTENTIMES HAS FAR

00:35:09.273 --> 00:35:10.675
FEWER VOTES.

00:35:10.741 --> 00:35:12.677
ON THE VERY SAME RECALL ELECTION

00:35:12.743 --> 00:35:14.212
DAY THAN THE INCUMBENT.

00:35:14.278 --> 00:35:16.647
WHO IS BEING TURFED OUT?

00:35:16.714 --> 00:35:18.182
SO WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO HERE

00:35:18.249 --> 00:35:19.283
WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:20.985
SHORTCOMING THIS CONFUSION IN

00:35:21.052 --> 00:35:22.086
CALIFORNIA'S RECALL PROCESS AND

00:35:22.153 --> 00:35:23.621
WE'RE GONNA WE WE SEEK TO FOLLOW

00:35:23.688 --> 00:35:25.289
US A SIMPLER RECALL MODEL THAT'S

00:35:25.356 --> 00:35:26.524
BEEN ADOPTED IN.

00:35:26.591 --> 00:35:28.960
EASIER FOR STATES BY THE WAY

00:35:29.026 --> 00:35:30.261
THAT ARE NOT YOU KNOW.

00:35:30.328 --> 00:35:31.662
BEAR TRICK PURPLE YEAR OR EVEN

00:35:31.729 --> 00:35:35.066
READ WRITE ARIZONA NEVADA NORTH

00:35:35.132 --> 00:35:37.401
DAKOTA AND WISCONSIN.

00:35:37.468 --> 00:35:37.969
THE IDEA IS THAT WE WOULD

00:35:38.035 --> 00:35:39.904
ELIMINATE THE CONFUSING YES NO

00:35:39.971 --> 00:35:42.073
RECALL QUESTION INSTEAD IF A

00:35:42.139 --> 00:35:43.608
RECALL IS TRIGGERED BY A

00:35:43.674 --> 00:35:45.543
SIGNATURE COLLECTION CAMPAIGN.

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:46.944
WE WOULD THEN WE WOULD THEN

00:35:47.011 --> 00:35:48.913
PLACE THAT THAT WOULD TRIGGER A

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:50.414
RECALL AUTOMATICALLY.

00:35:50.481 --> 00:35:51.482
IN ALL OF THE CANDIDATES BOTH

00:35:51.549 --> 00:35:53.050
THE INCUMBENT AND ANY POTENTIAL

00:35:53.117 --> 00:35:54.619
CHALLENGER WOULD THEN BE ON THE

00:35:54.685 --> 00:35:55.753
BALLOT.

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.255
I AND WHOEVER GETS THE MOST

00:35:57.321 --> 00:35:58.656
VOTES WOULD WIN THE ELECTED

00:35:58.723 --> 00:35:59.557
OFFICE.

00:35:59.624 --> 00:36:02.059
BY THE WAY MEMBERS ON RECALL

00:36:02.126 --> 00:36:03.427
ELECTION DAY TWO THOUSAND AND

00:36:03.494 --> 00:36:04.328
THREE ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER

00:36:04.395 --> 00:36:05.897
ACTUALLY GOT MORE VOTES THAN

00:36:05.963 --> 00:36:07.965
GRAY DAVIS -- SO SO MORE PEOPLE

00:36:08.032 --> 00:36:09.200
VOTED TO MAKE ARNOLD

00:36:09.267 --> 00:36:10.268
SCHWARZENEGGER GOVERNOR THEN

00:36:10.334 --> 00:36:10.968

00:36:11.035 --> 00:36:13.037
AGAINST THE RECALL OF GRAY DAVIS

00:36:13.104 --> 00:36:14.438
ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER UNDER THAT

00:36:14.505 --> 00:36:15.506
CIRCUMSTANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN

00:36:15.573 --> 00:36:18.109
ELECTED UNDER UNDER THE THE THE

00:36:18.175 --> 00:36:19.877
ADDRESS YOU TO BUT WHAT WE WANT

00:36:19.944 --> 00:36:21.846
TO DO IS MAKE SURE.

00:36:21.913 --> 00:36:23.548
THAT IF WE ACTUALLY ARE GOING.

00:36:23.614 --> 00:36:24.549
TO TO KICK SOMEBODY OUT.

00:36:24.615 --> 00:36:25.483
THERE OUGHT TO BE REPLACED BY

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:27.685
SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY ENJOYS MORE

00:36:27.752 --> 00:36:30.421
POPULAR SUPPORT.

00:36:30.488 --> 00:36:31.022
THEN THE INCUMBENT HE'S BEING

00:36:31.088 --> 00:36:32.256
TURFED OUT.

00:36:32.323 --> 00:36:33.591
THAT'S A SIMPLE CONCEPT ARE IT'S

00:36:33.658 --> 00:36:34.692
