ORDER THE FIRST HEARING OF THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON UTILITY AND ENERGY FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO SESSION- WE'RE HERE FOR AN OVERSIGHT HEARING TO DISCUSS THE EXECUTION AND REGULATION OF PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS. BEFORE I BEGIN I'D LIKE TO FIRST WELCOME BACK THE RETURNING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND EXTEND AN EVEN BIGGER WELCOME TO OUR NEW MEMBER COMMITTEE MEMBER ASSEMBLY MEMBER REBECCA BAUER KAHAN. WELCOME. I ALSO LIKE TO INTRODUCE THE STAFF OF THE COMMITTEE AND THE CHAMBERS WITH US ARE OUR NEW CHIEF CONSULTANT FLORSHEIM A- MELLOW LARA. SAYS WITH THE COMMITTEE AS A SCIENCE FELLOW OF SHE THEN WAS SNATCHED UP BY SENATOR JERRY HILL AT THE TIME. BECAME HIS CHIEF OF STAFF AND IS NOW BACK BACK HOME SO WE WELCOME YOU BACK. A REPUBLICAN CONSULTANT GREGORY MELKONIAN. WELCOME BACK. HI COMMITTEE SECRETARY VANESSA VACCARO AND JOINING US REMOTELY TODAY OUR FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF CHIEF KELLY SMITH WHO WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US THIS YEAR AND OUR NEW SCIENCE FELLOW JANE PARK. TO START WE HAVE SOME HOUSEKEEPING TO GO OVER ARE WE ARE PRACTICING SOCIAL DISTANCING. AND PHYSICAL DISTANCE IN AND WEARING MASKS AT ALL TIMES DURING THE CHAMBER IN THROUGHOUT THE CAPITAL. WE HAVE VERY LIMITED SPACE SO OUR PANELISTS WILL BE PARTICIPATING REMOTELY. WE ALSO HAVE THREE COMMITTEE MEMBERS PARTICIPATING REMOTELY ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MURATSUCHI CORK AND SANTIAGO. WE ENCOURAGE THOSE WHO ARE WATCHING THE CALL IN DURING THE PUBLIC COMMENT SEGMENT OF THIS HEARING. THE CALL IN NUMBER FOR THIS HEARING IS AREA CODE EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN. SIX NINE TWO EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN AND THE ACCESS CODE IS TWO FOUR TWO. SIX TWO THREE SEVEN YOU CAN ALSO FIND THIS NUMBER ON THE ASSEMBLY UTILITIES AND ENERGY COMMITTEE WEBSITE AS WELL AS ON THE TV SCREEN. NOW IT'S SAFE TO SAY. THAT WE ARE ALL FRUSTRATED BY THE USE OF PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS BY OUR STATE'S ELECTRIC UTILITIES. WE UNDERSTAND WE DOUNDERSTAND THE NEED TO USE THIS TOOL BUT IS ABSOLUTELY MUST BE USED AS A LAST RESORT. JUDICIOUSLY DURING EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS WHEN THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO ENSURE THAT UTILITY EQUIPMENT WILL NOT COME INTO CONTACT WITH VEGETATION AND START THE FIRE. AS WE'RE ALL TOO AWARE CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO GET HIT WITH THE RAVAGES. OF THE CLIMATE CHANGE ON OUR ENVIRONMENT. IT STRIKES IN MANY AREAS. FOR THIS COMMITTEE WE SEE HEAVY WINDS AND LOW HUMIDITY ALONG WITH AN AGING ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE CAUSING TRAGIC FIRES WITH GREAT HARM TO FAR TOO MANY COMMUNITIES. AFTER THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN FIRES IN SAN DIEGO THE UTILITY WAS AUTHORIZED BY THE CPUC TO REDUCE THE RISK OF FIRES CAUSED BY ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE BY TEMPORARILY TURNING OFF POWER. AND WHEN THE LEGISLATURE ADDRESS WILDFIRE THREATS AND UTILITIES IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE NEED TO HAVE PS PS EVENTS CONTINUE AS A TOOL. BUT IT WASN'T A MANDATE. BUT ITS STRATEGIC USE IS CALLED INTO QUESTION. WHEN WE SEE THE HUGE JOB AND USE WHICH OCCURRED IN TWENTY TWENTY. FROM TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WENTZ SDG AND E. U. S. P. S. P. S. EVENTS FOR THE FIRST TIME. TO TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IT WAS USED THIRTY THREE TIMES. BUT IN TWENTY TWENTY FOR JUST ONE YEAR WE HAD THIRTY THREE PS PS EVENTS. WHAT HAPPENS. PS PS EVENTS WERE A DISASTER IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. CUSTOMERS WERE CONFUSED ANGRY AND PARTICULARLY THOSE IN P. GINNY'S TERRITORY. I THOUGHT THE UTILITIES LEARN FROM THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN EVENTS. AND WHAT NOT TO DO. THE CPUC N. O. YES ARE TO BE COMMENDED FOR THE GREAT WORK THEY DID IN TWENTY TWENTY THE TIME PROTOCOLS AND WORK WITH UTILITIES TO ENSURE THAT IMPACTS ARE MITIGATED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. AN ADULT REPORTS INDICATE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN SOME PARTS OF THE STATE PARTICULARLY IN PG&amp;E TERRITORIES HOWEVER WE WERE ALARMED TO HEAR THAT EDISON NEARLY DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF EVENTS THEY CALLED IN TWENTY TWENTY AND HAD REPEATED FAILURES TO FOLLOW PROTOCOLS AT THE EXPENSE OF CUSTOMERS. AND PUBLIC SAFETY. EVEN THOUGH THEY REPEATEDLY ASSURED THE CPUC PRESIDENT. THAT WE ARE GOING TO. WE PLAN TO WE WANT TO BUT IN THE MOMENT THEY DID NOT. THIS RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE AGENCIES HAVE SUFFICIENT ENFORCEMENT TOOLS WHICH CAN BE USED IN REAL TIME IF A UTILITY IS CALLING EVENTS UNNECESSARILY OR FAILING TO FOLLOW PROPER NOTIFICATION PROTOCOLS FOR CUSTOMERS. PUBLIC SAFETY PARTNERS AND OTHER STATE AGENCIES. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO WELCOME OUR FIRST PANEL TO DISCUSS THE REGULATION OF PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS. PRESIDENT BADGER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR GIPSON DIRECTOR THOMAS JACOBS AND DIRECTOR PALMER WE WELCOME YOU. AND THE FLOOR IS YOURS FOR THE REST. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR HOLDEN AND VICE CHAIR PATTERSON AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AMERIGO BADGER AND I SERVED AS PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WITH ME TODAY AS YOUSTATED. R. CPUC EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR RACHEL PETERSON AND THE DIRECTOR OF OUR WILDFIRE SAFETY DIVISION CAROLINE THOMAS JACOBS BOTH OF WHOM WILL ALSO PRESENT WITH ME THIS AFTERNOON. LEE PALMER DIRECTOR OF OUR SAFETY ENFORCEMENT DIVISION IS ALSO HERE TO RESPOND TO QUESTIONS AFTER OUR PRESENTATION. RARELY HAS IT BEEN MORE EVIDENT. THEN NOW THAT RELIABLE ELECTRIC SERVICE IS THE CENTRAL TO THE SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF CALIFORNIANS. IT IS AN IMPORTANT SERVICE IN NORMAL TIMES. AND IT IS MORE CRITICAL NOW WITH CALIFORNIA'S LEARNING AND WORKING FROM HOME DO TO COPE WITH NINETEEN EPIDEMIC. PANDEMIC USING THE ACCELERATION OF CLIMATE CHANGE HAS BECAUSE OUR WELFARE SEASONS TO START EARLIER AND END LATER. TWENTY TWENTY INTO EARLY TWENTY TWENTY ONE WAS A VERY LONG FIRE SEASON AND CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF POWER SHUT OFFS BY THEIR UTILITIES. UP UNTILMID JANUARY THE MAJOR UTILITIES WE'RE CONTINUING TO CALL POWER SHUT OFF THE EVENTS. THE CPUC HAS BEEN DRIVEN DRIVING. THE UTILITIES TO REDUCE THE RISK OF UTILITY BECAUSE WILDFIRES TO BETTER PLANNING GRID HARDENING AND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. ANOTHER TOOL AVAILABLE TO THEM IS TO PRO ACTIVELY SHUT POWER OFF TO CUSTOMERS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDING DURING EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS. THESE HAVE BECOME KNOWN AS POWER SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF OR PS PS EVENTS. UNLIKE THE OTHER MITIGATION STRATEGIES THESE PROACTIVE POWER SHUT OFFS HAVE VERY REAL AND DIRECT IMPACTS TO CUSTOMERS. EVERY TIME UTILITIES SHUTS OFF POWER IT IS TRADING OFF THE SAFETY AND IMMEDIATE WELL BEING OF ITS CUSTOMERS TO MITIGATE RISK OF IGNITED A WILDFIRE. THIS TRADE OFF IS Y. P. S. B. S. OF THIS MUST BE A MEASURE OF LAST RESORT. FOR MANY LOSS OF POWER MEANS LOSS OF INCOME LOSS OF A DAY OR MORE OF LEARNING. A FEAR AND UNCERTAINTY FOR THOSE WHO RELY ON POWER TO SUSTAIN LIFE SUPPORTING MEDICAL DEVICES. AT RISK IN A P. S. P. S. OF THAT OUR PEOPLE'S LIVES AND PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOODS. THESE RISK MUST CONTINUALLY UNDERSTOOD THESE REST MUST BE CONTINUALLY UNDERSCORED. WHEN THE TWO OF THESE WERE BEFORE THE COMMISSION LAST AUGUST TO PRESENT ON THEIR PREPAREDNESS TO THE TO EXECUTE B. S. B. AS VETS IN TWENTY TWENTY WE EMPHASIZE THAT THE EFFECTS ON PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE NOT THEORETICAL BUT VERY REAL. WE MADE IT VERY CLEAR THEY WOULD BE JUDGED BY OUTCOMES. NOT BY PLANTS. WHEN LOOKING AT OUTCOMES OF THIS PAST YEAR'S PS PS EVENTS WE CONTINUE TO SEE THE NEED FOR IMPROVEMENT ACROSS ALL UTILITIES. AS WE WILL REMEMBER P. GENIES POOR EXECUTION OF PS PS IN THE FALL OF TWENTY NINETEEN HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED TO UPDATE OUR PS PS GUIDELINES AND UTILIZE THE WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLAN PROCESS TO STEER THE UTILITIES TOWARDS IMPROVING THEIR PERFORMANCE AND LESSENING THE SCOPE. MAGNITUDE AND FREQUENCY OF PS PS EVENTS. FOUR PG&amp;E WE APPEAR TO SEE IMPROVEMENTS AS AS CHAIR YOU STATED EARLIER ON A FEW FRONTS OVERALL REDUCTION IN SCOPE AND SCALE COMPARED TO TWENTY NINETEEN IMPROVE PLANNING OF COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS AS WELL AS IMPROVED FORECASTING. HOWEVER INFORMATION SHARING WITH STATE LOCAL AGENCIES AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS NEEDS TO BE ENHANCED. WE EXPECT GREATER EXPANSION. IN DEPLOYMENT OF ITS BATTERY BACKUP PROGRAM PARTICULARLY FOR THE MEDICAL BASELINE CUSTOMERS AND ITS NOTIFICATION PROTOCOLS ALSO REQUIRE IMPROVEMENTS. ESPECIALLY IN ELIMINATING INSTANCES WHEN IMPACTED CUSTOMERS ARE NOT NOTICED OR WHAT WE REFER TO AS NO NOTICE D. INTERNALIZATION. FOUR ESTY GENIE WE ALSO SEE IMPROVED PLANNING OF ITS COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS BUT THEY TO REQUIRE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE AREAS OF INFORMATION SHARING WITH STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES. GREATER DEPLOYMENT IN ITS BATTERY BACKUP PROGRAM AGAIN PARTICULARLY FOR THE MEDICAL BASED LIKE CUSTOMERS AND ELIMINATING ALSO THE NO NOTICE D. ENERGY STATION. NOW WITH RESPECT TO EDISON'S PS PS EVENTS THIS YEAR THIS PAST YEAR ITS PERFORMANCE HAS REQUIRED SPECIAL ATTENTION AND HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF WHO TO PUBLIC MEETINGS AT THE COMMISSION. SAYS THE START OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR. THERE ARE MANY AREAS WHERE I BELIEVE EDISON DID NOT MEASURE UP TO THE STANDARDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS WHICH IT CUSTOMERS DESERVE. EDICION INITIATED SIXTEEN PS PS EVENTS BETWEEN MAY AND DECEMBER LAST YEAR. THE MAJORITY OF THE EVENTS WERE IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER INCLUDING TWO DURING THE MAJOR HOLIDAYS. AMONG THE VARIOUS PROBLEMS WE OBSERVE FOR ISSUES WITH THE LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY AROUND EVER SINCE PS PS DECISION MAKING PROCESS IN ADEQUATE NOTIFICATION TO IMPACTED CUSTOMERS POOR COORDINATION AND COMMUNICATION WITH STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. SHORTCOMINGS IN IDENTIFYING AND NOTIFYING MEDICAL BASELINE AND ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS CUSTOMERS AND DEFICIENT PS PS POST EVENT REPORTING TO THE COMMISSION. IN ADDITION WE CONTINUE TO HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS WITH THE PACE AT WHICH EDISON HAS BEEN DEPLOYING BACKUP POWER TO HELP VULNERABLE CUSTOMERS COPE WITH PS PS CHÃ¡VEZ. REGARDING EDISON'S NOTIFICATION SHORTCOMINGS. ONLY 20% OF THE CUSTOMERS IT GAVE ADVANCE NOTICES TO THIS PAST FIRE SEASON WERE AFFECTED BY A P. S. P. S. OF AT. BUT IT IS DESIRED TO HAVE AS FEW CUSTOMERS DE ENERGIZED AS POSSIBLE THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THIS PLANNING APPROACH IF YOU'RE CONSISTENTLY PUTTING LARGE NUMBERS OF CUSTOMERS ON NOTICE AND THEN NOTHING HAPPENS. THERE WERE ALSO TOO MANY INSTANCES THAT THERE WERE NO NOTICE D. ENERGY STATIONS. FORECASTING AND COMMUNICATIONS MUST IMPROVE. LAST YEAR THE CPUC HAD TO ENHANCE ITS OVERSIGHT OF P. GENIES CORRECTIVE ACTIONS GOING INTO THE TWENTY TWENTY FIRE SEASON. WE'RE DOING THIS NOW WITH EDISON THIS YEAR TO ENSURE THEY LIVE UP TO THEIR COMMITMENTS UNDER THEIR CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN. IN ADDITION TO THE EDSON FOCUSED PUBLIC MEETINGS WE HAVE HAD THIS YEAR WE WILL ALSO HOST A PUBLIC WORKSHOP THIS MONTH. TO HEAR FROM ALL UTILITIES AND IMPACTED COMMUNITIES ON LESSONS LEARNED FROM TWENTY TWENTY. THESE LESSONS WILL INFORM AND ANOTHER ROUND OF UPDATING OF OUR PS PS GUIDELINES WHICH WEEK COMMENCED. ON FEBRUARY NINETEENTH. WE WILL CONTINUE TO HOLD PUBLIC MEETINGS AS WE ENTER THE CRITICAL MONTHS OF THE WELFARE SEASON TO ASSESS THE UTILITIES PREPAREDNESS. IF REQUIRED WE WILL UTILIZE OUR EXPANSIVE ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY OVER THE UTILITIES TO DELIVER THE TYPE OF BEHAVIOR CUSTOMERS DESERVE AND EXPECT FROM PROVIDERS OF AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE. IN FACT AS A RESULT OF THE UTILITIES POOR EXECUTION OF PS PS EVENTS IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE CVC OPENED UP A FORMAL INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE WHETHER UTILITIES PRIORITIZE SAFETY AND COMPLY WITH THE COMMISSION'S P. USE P. S. P. S. REGULATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDERS PARTICIPATING IN THIS INVESTIGATION AND A FORMER FORMAL DECISION IS FORTHCOMING. LASTLY I WANT TO RE ITERATE THE C. P. UC'S COMMITMENT TO DRIVING UTILITIES TOWARDS ZERO NEED. AND THE USE OF PS PS THE LOSS OF POWER CAUSES MAJOR DISRUPTIONS TO HOUSEHOLDS BUSINESSES MEDICAL FACILITIES COMMUNICATION CARRIERS. AND OTHER CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. IT'S STRANGE THE STATE AND LOCAL EMERGENCY AND PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL AS THEY WORK TO ENSURE PUBLIC SAFETY ON OTHER. FRONTS THE PUBLIC DESERVES BETTER AND WE ARE WORKING TO ENSURE THEY ARE BETTER SERVED BY THE UTILITIES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR VICE CHAIR I WILL NOW ASK EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR PETERSON TO PROVIDE- HER PRESENTATION FOR YOU. THANK YOU PRESIDENT PATTERNED- THANK YOU TERRY HOLDEN VICE CHAIR AN HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY MY PURPOSE IS TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE CLOSED END URGENT ENGAGEMENT THAT DIRECTOR PALMER DIRECTOR THOMAS JACOBS AND I HAD WITH THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES IN TWENTY TWENTY TO IMPROVE THEIR EXECUTION OF PS PS EVENTS. OUR ENGAGEMENT IS DRIVEN BY CONTINUALLY UNDERSCORING THE RISKS TO PUBLIC SAFETY THAT PS PS EVENTS BRING AS PRESIDENT BADGER SAID. THE FACT REGULATORY EXPECTATIONS AND RULES THAT THEY'VE UTILITIES ARE REQUIRED TO BE AS THE OPERATORS OF THEIR SYSTEM. AND LAST TO DRIVE THE UTILITIES TOWARD ENTIRELY ELIMINATING THEIR USE OF DNA TECHNICIAN AS A WILDFIRE RISK MITIGATION TOOL. WE PARTNER CLOSELY WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT CALIFORNICA OH YES TO HOLD THE UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE. EVERY MONTH FROM FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONWARD WE HELD LEADERSHIP LEVEL MEETINGS THAT PRESIDENT VOUCHER CHIEF THOMAS PORTER AND DIRECTOR MARK JEWELERS YUJI AND THEIR DELEGATES ATTENDED. ALONG WITH LEADERSHIP FROM THE THREE LARGE ELECTRIC UTILITIES TO DISCUSS WILDFIRE AND PS PS PREPARATION. WE CONTINUE THOSE MONTHLY MEETINGS AND CHIEF PORTER AND DIRECTOR JEWELERS YOU G. JUST YESTERDAY JOIN PRESIDENT AFTER TO HEAR FROM THE UTILITIES ABOUT THEIR PREPARATION FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE SEASON. AT THE SENIOR STAFF LEVEL DIRECTOR PALMER DIRECTOR THOMAS JACOBS AND I. ALONG WITH NUMEROUS MEMBERS OF OUR TEAMS JOINT CALLOW YES AND THE UTILITIES FOR MONTHLY OPERATIONAL MEETINGS ALSO THROUGHOUT TWENTY TWENTY. AT THOSE MEETINGS WE FOCUS ON THE UTILITIES READY NICE TO SUBMIT NOTIFICATION FORMS AS REQUIRED BY CARILLO YES AND ENSURE THAT THEIR DATA AND MAPS WERE READY TO BE PROVIDED TO EMERGENCY RESPONDERS AMONG OTHER OPERATIONAL AND DISEASE. NOW I WANT TO TURN MORE SPECIFICALLY TO OUR ENGAGEMENT WITH PG&amp;E. WE CONCENTRATED THE MOST ATTENTION ON P. JEANNIE LAST YEAR BECAUSE THEIR EXECUTION HAS BEEN SO POOR IN TWENTY NINETEEN. AND BECAUSE THE COMPANY WAS STILL IN BANKRUPTCY AT THAT TIME. PRESENT ABOUT YOUR ISSUED A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN IN LATE TWENTY NINETEEN WHICH DIRECTOR PALMER AND DIRECTOR THOMAS JACOBS AND I USED AS THE BASIS FOR WEEKLY DETAILED BRIEFINGS ON THEIR PROGRESS. WE REQUIRED YOU DO NEED TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF MILESTONE ACHIEVEMENTS ON EVERY ELEMENT OF PS PS PREPARATION. CRUCIALLY WE REQUIRE NUMEROUS IMPROVEMENTS TO BE COMPLETED BEFORE SEPTEMBER FIRST TO ENSURE THAT THEY WERE IN PLACE BEFORE THE MOST INTENSE PART OF THE WILD WIND AND PSPO SEASON. ON THE CUSTOMER FRONT FOR EXAMPLE WE TRACKED THEIR PROGRESS IN UNDERSTANDING THEIR MEDICAL BASELINE AND CRITICAL CARE CUSTOMERS NEEDS AND LOCATIONS AND HOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEM. WE TRACKED THEIR PREPARATION OF COMMUNICATION COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS AND ESTABLISH HOW THEY WERE ESTABLISHING STRONG WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH CITY COUNTY AND TRIBAL EMERGENCY RESPONDERS. AND THEIR TRAINING OF A MURDER THEIR OWN EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL ALL WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC THAT WE WERE ALL LIVING THROUGH. ON THE TECHNOLOGY FRONT WE MONITORED IMPROVEMENTS TO THEIR WEBSITE AND EFFORT THAT WE INVOLVED THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY IN AS WELL. THIS STEPPING UP THEIR CUSTOMER CALL CENTER AND THEIR GIS SYSTEMS THAT WOULD SHOW THE MAP AND SCOPE OF IT. PS PS OUTAGE AS WELL AS ALL OF THEIR TOOLS TO MONITOR WEATHER CONDITIONS AND FORECAST THE NEED AND SCOPE OF THE PS PFE THAT'S- AS FOR THE ELECTRIC GRIN. WE MONITORED P. GENIES DEPLOYMENT OF SECTIONALS VISION DEVICES BACK UP GENERATION AND OTHER WAYS OF PROTECTING GROUPS OF CUSTOMERS FROM LOSING ELECTRICITY. WHEN IT CAME TO P. GENIES EXECUTION IN TWENTY TWENTY I BELIEVE THAT PRESIDENT BADGERS CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN PLUS ARE CLOSE ENGAGEMENT HAD THE EFFECT OF IMPROVING THE UTILITIES EXECUTION LAST YEAR. NOW TURNING TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON. USED TO THE SAME ENGAGEMENT APPROACH FOR EDISON IN PARTICULAR IN THE SUMMER BRIEFINGS ON THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR MEDICAL BASELINE AND CRITICAL CARE CUSTOMERS. THEIR PREPAREDNESS TO PROVIDE MAPS AND INFORMATION ABOUT EVENTS TO CAROL- YEAH AND EMERGENCY RESPONDERS. AND THEIR NOTIFICATION SYSTEMS. WE MONITOR TABLE TOP EXERCISES ALONG WITH OUR COLLEAGUES THE CALLOW YES AND PROVIDED SPECIFIC FEEDBACK. EDISON NEARLY CALLED THE S. P. S. EVENTS INVADE MAY AND JUNE LAST YEAR AND WE HELD IT AFTER ACTION DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM INCLUDING CHIEF TOM PORTER TO DRIVE HOME THE POINT THAT THEIR WEATHER AND WILDFIRE RISK CONDITIONS FORECASTING TOOLS NEEDED IMPROVEMENT. IN AUGUST WE REQUIRED ADDISON AND THE OTHER UTILITIES TO RUN A TEST NOTIFICATION TO THEIR COMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS AND WE OBSERVE TO PRESS ALT THEY GAVE US CONCERNED. WE DIRECTLY INFORMED ADDISON OF THE PROBLEMS THAT COMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES EXPERIENCE WITH THOSE NOTIFICATIONS. DURING THE FALL AND EARLY WINTER PRESIDENT BADGERING THE COMMISSIONERS AND OUR PARTNERS AT CALLAWAY F. IN CALIFORNIA- ALL GREW INCREASINGLY CONCERNED ABOUT EDISON'S EXECUTION. AS PRESIDENT BADGER NOTED TO YOU. EDISON OVER NOTIFIED IN SOME CASES AND FAILED TO NOTIFY AND OTHERS QUITE EGREGIOUSLY ON THANKSGIVING DAY. THERE WERE EVENTS BACK TO BACK. ALI EXPERIENCE A PARTICULARLY SEVERE SEASON WITH NINE P. S. P. S. EVENTS IN TWENTY TWENTY AND ONE IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE RESPONDED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THEIR LAST EVENT WHICH LASTED FROM JANUARY TWELFTH TO JANUARY TWENTY FIRST. PRESIDENT BASSAR ISSUED A PUBLIC LETTER TO EDISON ON JANUARY NINETEENTH EXPRESSING HER DEEP CONCERNS WITH THEIR EXECUTION. AS WITH PG&amp;E AT THE END OF TWENTY NINETEEN THE LETTER LAID OUT FIVE AREAS OF CONCERN. AND SET OUT CORRECTIVE ACTION EXPECTATIONS. THE AREAS ARE OF THE TRANSPARENCY OF THEIR DECISION MAKING PROCESS HOW THEY EXECUTE THEIR NOTIFICATIONS COMMUNICATING AND WORKING WELL WITH STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. UNDERSTANDING THEIR MEDICAL BASELINE AND ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS CUSTOMERS AND THE QUALITY OF THEIR PS PS POST EVENT REPORTING. ON JANUARY TWENTY SIXTH WE HELD A PUBLIC MEETING TO DISCUSS THE LETTER LED BY PRESIDENT BAXTER AND THE CPUC COMMISSIONERS. AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF CHAR HOLDEN CALIFORNIA CHIEF PORTER CALORIE OR YES DIRECTOR TO THE G. G. CONGRESSMAN MIKE GARCIA SENATOR BEN HUESO AND SENATOR HENRY STERN. ASSEMBLY WOMAN SAYS THAT BY A DATA. OR COUNTY SAN DONALD WAGNER AND SEVERAL ELECTED FROM SIMI VALLEY AND ACTON TOWN. THE LEADERS DIRECTLY QUESTION ABSENT ON THEIR EXECUTION AND THE COMPANY'S EXECUTIVES ALSO HEARD TWO HOURS OF PUBLIC COMMENT ABOUT THE IMPACT OF PS PS ON PEOPLE'S DAILY LIVES. ON FEBRUARY TWELFTH AS REQUIRED BY US EDISON SUBMITTED THEIR CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN. AND IN THE SAME WAY THAT W REQUIRE DETAILED BRIEFINGS FROM PG&amp;E AND TWENTY TWENTY WE THINK ON THE SAME DETAILED BRIEFINGS ON MILESTONES AND IMPROVEMENTS WITH ADDISON. AS PRESIDENT BADGER NOTED JUST THIS PAST MONDAY WE ALSO HOLD A PUBLIC DISCUSSION OF THE SAME CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN SO THAT THE PUBLIC COULD HEAR DIRECTLY FROM AND FROM THE COMPANY. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I'M NOT GOING TO TOUCH ON DETAILS ARE ENGAGEMENT WITH S. U. G. A. B. BUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ON THAT IF REQUESTED. I WANT TO ADDRESS ENFORCEMENT BRIEFLY. WE HAVE TO OPEN FORMAL ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS GOING ON RIGHT NOW. WHICH USE THE EXTENT OF OUR ENFORCEMENT TOOLS- RELATED TO THAT ALL THE UTILITIES PERFORMANCE IN TWENTY NINETEEN. NOW SINCE THE LAST PS PS EVENT CONCLUDED ON JANUARY TWENTY FIRST OUR SAFETY IMPORTANT ENFORCEMENT DIVISION UNDER DIRECTOR PALMER IS CONDUCTING COMPLIANCE REVIEW OF ALL THIRTY THREE. PS PS POST EVENT REPORTS. FOR EACH EVENT WE REQUIRE THE UTILITIES TO REPORT ON APPROXIMATELY THIRTY DIFFERENT ELEMENTS. OF THE RELATED TO THEIR EXECUTION THAT INCLUDES THEIR FORECASTING OF WEATHER AND RISK CONDITIONS DETAILS OF THEIR NOTIFICATION THE TOTAL NUMBERS AND CATEGORIES OF IMPACTED CUSTOMERS. THE STAND UP AN OPERATION OF COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS- AND COMMUNICATION WITH STATE AND LOCAL AND TRIBAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE. THESE ARE COMPLEX EVENTS AND WE DO NEED TO EVALUATE MULTIPLE ASPECTS OF EACH ONE. WELL WE'RE CONDUCTING OUR COMPLIANCE REVIEW WE ARE CONSIDERING APPROPRIATE ENFORCEMENT TOOLS SUCH AS LARGER FORMAL INVESTIGATIONS POTENTIAL NOTICES OF VIOLATIONS AND PROPOSAL'S REMEDIES OR FINANCIAL PENALTIES TO THE COMMISSION. WE'VE NOT YET ESTABLISHED A DELEGATED STAFF CITATION PROGRAM FOR THE GUIDELINES THE PS PS GUIDELINES THAT'S WHY I C. D. WOULD NEED TO PROPOSE REMEDIES OR PENALTIES TO THE COMMISSION FOR APPROVAL. AFTER IT COMPLETES ITS COMPLIANCE REVIEW. AND ON THAT NOTE WE DO HAVE BROAD ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY OVER THE- ELECTRIC UTILITIES AND A WIDE RANGE OF ENFORCEMENT TOOLS AT OUR DISPOSAL AND WE SEEK TO USE ENFORCEMENT TOOLS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE SITUATION. HERE ARE INTERESTED IN THE STATE EXECUTION OF PS PS OF THEM. SO. TO THAT END I HOPE I'VE PROVIDED YOU WITH A SENSE OF OUR CLOSE AND BURGEONING GAUGE MA'AM WITH UTILITIES IN TWENTY TWENTY AND HOW THAT ENGAGEMENT IS CONTINUING. AS I TURNED TO DIRECTOR CAROLINE THOMAS JACOBS WHO RUNS OUR WILDFIRE SAFETY DIVISION. SHE'LL TALK ABOUT P. S. P. S. AS A RISK MITIGATION STRATEGY IN THE WILD PER MEDICATION PLANS. AND I WANT TO KNOW THAT THE CPUC AS CLOSELY AS WE ARE ENGAGING NOW WITH THE UTILITIES IS NOT RESTING ON ANY ASSUMPTION. THAT DE ENERGIZE ASIAN IS PERMANENTLY WITH US IN CALIFORNIA IN FACT WE'RE DRIVING TO ELIMINATE THIS RISK STRATEGY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT COULD RECORD PETERSON GOOD AFTERNOON SURE HOLDEN VICE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY AS MENTIONED ON THE RECORD THE RELATIVELY NEW WILDFIRE SAFETY DIVISION ESTABLISHED IN JANUARY LAST YEAR OUR PRIMARY MISSION IS OVERSIGHT OF THE UTILITY'S EFFORTS TO REDUCE THEIR WILDFIRE RISK THE MAIN VEHICLE THROUGH WHICH WE DO THAT IS THERE WATER MITIGATION PLANS. FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY PLANTS THE COMMISSION ADOPTED COMPREHENSIVE NEW GUIDELINES THAT REQUIRED THE UTILITIES TO EXPLAIN HOW THEY UNDERSTAND AND ADDRESS THEIR WILDFIRE RISK REQUIRED SUBMISSION OF NEW PERFORMANCE METRICS SO WE COULD COMPARE UTILITIES AND TRACK PROGRESS OVER TIME AND ADOPTED A NEW MATURITY MODEL TO MONITOR GROWTH OF KEY CAPABILITIES. OUR INTENT WITH THE TWO GUARD WAS TO ESTABLISH A BASELINE UNDERSTANDING OF THE UTILITIES WILDFIRE MITIGATION CAPABILITIES. REQUIRING AT THE PLANS TO HAVE THE UTILITIES EXPLAINER UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR RISK. DESCRIBE HOW TO STRATEGIES REDUCE THAT RISK AND DRIVE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT. WE INCORPORATED INTO THE PLANT INTO THE TWENTY TWENTY GUIDELINES AND MOST RELEVANT TO OUR DISCUSSION TODAY A REQUIREMENT FOR THE UTILITIES TO EXPLAIN THEIR USE OF PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF AS A WILDFIRE MITIGATION STRATEGY. HERE I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A DISTINCTION ON THE DIVISION ROLE ON PS PS AND THE COMMISSION. WITHIN THE WILD PART OF EDUCATION PLANS WE ADDRESS PS PS AT THE PROGRAMMATIC LEVEL WELL THE COMMISSION'S PF PF SPECIFIC GUIDELINES AND REGULATIONS PROVIDE DIRECTION ON THE TACTFUL USE OF IT. WE LOOK AT PS PS AS ONE OF THE UTILITIES MANY WILDFIRE MITIGATION STRATEGIES. WE RECOGNIZE HOWEVER THAT THAT PS PS IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER WELFARE MITIGATION STRATEGIES DUE TO ITS ASSOCIATED COSTS AND IMPACTS SUCH AS THE IMPACT ON AT RISK CUSTOMERS PUBLIC SAFETY PROVIDERS IN CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. WITHIN THE DIVISION WE ALSO TREAT PFAS NOT JUST AS A STRATEGY BUT A STRATEGY THAT HAS ITS OWN INHERENT RISK. DUE TO THOSE CONSEQUENCES. OUR APPROACH THAT IS THAT PS PS WHEN CONSIDERED ALONGSIDE INVESTMENT IN OTHER MITIGATION ACTIVITIES SUCH AS HARDENING GREAT REDESIGN. SHOULD BE REDUCED IN SCOPE DURATION AND FREQUENCY OVER TIME. THAT MEANS THE PS PS SHOULD BE A WATER MITIGATION STRATEGY THAT EVENTUALLY IS NO LONGER NEEDED. LAST YEAR THROUGH THE NEW PERFORMANCE METRICS WE REQUIRE WE REQUIRE THE UTILITIES TO SUBMIT HISTORICAL PS PS METRICS THAT SUMMARIZE THE ANNUAL PS PS IMPACT SUCH AS THE NUMBER OF EVENTS. PUT UP A TOTAL CUSTOMER OUTAGE HOURS AND THE IMPACTS TO CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. AND NOW WE INCLUDE NOW WE REQUIRE. ON THOSE METRICS THOSE METRICS PROVIDES A BASELINE UPON WHICH TO PRINT COMPARE PROGRESS OVER YEAR. ON FEBRUARY FIFTH THE LARGE UTILITIES PG&amp;E SAN DIEGO AND EDISON SUBMITTED THEIR TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHILE FOR MITIGATION PLAN UPDATES. THERE'S A MISSION INCLUDED THEIR PF PF PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR TWENTY TWENTY. SO NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME WE CAN MEASURE PROGRESS YEAR OVER YEAR. SINCE WE ARE ACTIVELY IN OUR EVALUATION OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE PLANNED I WILL NOT SPEAK TO OUR ONGOING ASSESSMENT OF THOSE PLANS. I WILL HOWEVER MENTION A FEW KEY FACTS FROM THEIR SUBMISSIONS THAT OUR PUBLIC AND AVAILABLE TO ALL. FURTHER TWENTY TWENTY ONE DATA SUBMISSIONS WELL THE NUMBER OF P. S. P. S. EVENTS ONE UP ACROSS THE STATE. THE OVERALL NUMBER OF CATS CUSTOMER OUTAGE HOURS DUE TO PS PS DECREASED. SPECIFICALLY PG&amp;E AND EDISON REDUCED OUTAGE HOURS. PG&amp;E DROPPED FROM NINETY POINT SEVEN MILLION CUSTOMER OUTAGE HOURS IN TWENTY NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWO POINT THREE MILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY. EDISON DROPPED FROM FIVE POINT THREE MILLION HOW DID HOURS TO FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION OUT OF DOLLARS WEALTHY DIEGO ACTUALLY DOUBLE THERE'S FROM WHAT ONE POINT THREE MILLION OUT OF OURS IN NINETEEN TO TWO POINT SIX. IN TWENTY TWENTY. THIS IS NOT HOWEVER ADDRESS THE VERY REAL ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN MENTIONED A FEW TIMES ALREADY THIS EVENING OR THIS AFTERNOON. IN WE CAN EVENT THIS CALL BUT NO DEACTIVATION HAPPENED. A POTENTIAL DEREGULATION STILL CARRIES WITH IT RISK FOR COMMUNITIES PUBLIC SAFETY PARTNERS AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. GIVEN THAT RISK IN ADDITION TO SUBMITTING THEIR TWENTY TWENTY PFF'S METRICS. IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE PLANS WE NOW REQUIRE THE UTILITIES TO DESCRIBE THEIR VISION. FOR THE NECESSITY OF PS PS OVER TIME. AND XPLAIN THEIR PLANS TO REDUCE SCALE SCOPE AND IMPORTANTLY FREQUENCY OF PS PS GOING INTO THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE SEASON. AND AGAIN I WILL BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO OUR ONGOING ASSESSMENT OF THOSE COMMITMENTS I'M SURE THE UTILITIES WILL SPEAK TO THEM IN THEIR REMARKS I DO HOWEVER WANT TO CALL IT A FEW ELEMENTS. TO SHOW HOW WE ARE USING THE PLAN IS TO MAKE THE UTILITIES DESCRIBED THEIR LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE PFAS OF SEASONS AND EXPLAIN THEIR EXPECTATIONS. FOR HOW THEIR P. S. P. S. PROGRAM WILL EVOLVE OVER THE COMING YEARS. FOR EXAMPLE. HE ASKED ABOUT PG&amp;E STATE SENATE'S PICK IT IS TAKING ACTION TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF PS PS. BUT LIKE THE FUTURE UNCERTAINTY LIMITS ITS ABILITY TO SET TARGETS. TO REDUCE SCOPE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SPECIFICALLY PG&amp;E PROJECT AN INCREASE OF EIGHT MILLION CUSTOMER OUTAGE HOURS IN PS PS FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE SEASON. ALL THREE UTILITIES PROJECT MORE FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS IN THE COMING YEARS BUT ONLY P. JEANNIE PRODUCTION HIGHER USE OF PS PS. PG&amp;E THE INCREASED PRODUCTION IS ATTRIBUTED TO UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING THEIR FEDERAL PROBATION AND CURRENT PROPOSED CONDITIONS THAT COULD IMPACT P. GENIES- IMPLEMENTATION OF PS PS. EDISON EXPECTS TO REDUCE PF PF CUSTOMER OUTAGE HOURS BY THIRTY TO FORTY PERCENT. FROM FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION THIS PAST SEASON TO TWO POINT SIX MILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND SAN DIEGO EXPECTS APPROXIMATELY A ONE FROM TWO POINT SIX MILLION TO ONE POINT SIX NINE. WITH THE CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OF THE DIVISIONS COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS BEGINNING THIS YEAR WE ALSO NOW REQUIRE THE UTILITIES TO PROVIDE QUARTERLY PERFORMANCE DATA. SO WE CAN TRACK PROGRESS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. INCLUDING PROGRESS ON INITIATIVES SUCH AS SEXUALIZING AND WEATHER FORECASTING. FREQUENCY SCOPE AND DURATION EVENTS IN CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN CUSTOMERS-IMPACTED. THESE DATA WILL BE USED TO TRACK PROGRESS ON THAT THE UTILITIES IMPLEMENTATION TO ASSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR ANNUAL COMMITMENT. YOU SHOULD TELL THE MAKES AND THE MITIGATION PLAN. TO REDUCE THE SCOPE. DURATION AND MOST IMPORTANTLY FREQUENCY OF PS PS AS A MITIGATION STRATEGY. TO CLOSE ALL REITERATE PS PS IS INCLUDED IN THE PLANS AT A PROGRAMMATIC LEVEL AN ACT THAT LEVEL WE'RE AFFECTING IT'S USED AS BOTH A MITIGATION STRATEGY. AS WELL S A RISK FACTOR UNTO ITSELF DO THE SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES IT HAS ON OUR COMMUNITIES. OUR EVALUATION OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE PLANTS IS SCHEDULED TO BE COMPLETED BY THE GIRLS EARLY SUMMER. AND WILL INCLUDE AN ASSESSMENT OF THE UTILITIES PLANNED FOR FUTURE USE OF PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU AND WE APPRECIATE THE- DETAIL OF YOUR PRESENTATION AND- GETTING US A FOCUSED ON THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT AS A REGULATORY BODY YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO. TO MOVE OUT ON SO WE APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY- NEXT I'D LIKE TO WELCOME OUR SECOND PANEL TO DISCUSS THE EXECUTION. OF PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS. AND SO WE'D LIKE TO WELCOME PHIL HARRINGTON. A SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON. JILL ANDERSON SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF CUSTOMER SERVICE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON. CEMEX SCIENCE. A SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT CHIEF RISK OFFICER PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC. AND JOHN JENKINS VICE PRESIDENT ELECTRIC SYSTEM OPERATIONS SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC- IF YOU GO IN THE ORDER IN WHICH YOU WERE CALLED THAT WOULD BE APPRECIATED SO WILL WELCOME FIRST- PHIL HARRINGTON. WELCOME BACK THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING- ACTUALLY THIS GOOD AFTERNOON NOW CHARLTON AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- I'M PHIL HARRINGTON SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON- AS- THE CHAIR NOTED MY COLLEAGUE JOE ANDERSON. A SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF CUSTOMER SERVICE WILL ALSO JOIN YOU PRESENTED TO YOU TODAY. WE'VE ALSO PROVIDED SOME BACKUP MATERIAL- FOR YOUR REFERENCE I WILL NOT BE- REPORTED A SLIGHT SO AS I GO TO MY CONVERSATION HERE. BOB LET ME START BY SAYING WHAT YOU ALL KNOW TOO WELL AND THAT'S THE TWENTY TWENTY WAS A YEAR OF UNIMAGINABLE. TRAGEDY FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS. FIVE SIX LARGE WHILE FOR ARE HAVE A TWENTY. OF THESE FIRES BURNED MORE THAN POINT TWO EIGHT OF THE STATE IN CLAIMS. THREE LIVES. THE NUMBER MAGNITUDE OF LAST YEAR'S WILDFIRES ILLUSTRATE THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE FIRE THREAT WE'RE FACING. HOUSTON WEATHER CONDITIONS ALONG WITH ABUNDANT DRY FUELS. UNTIL A FEW WEEKS AGO WITH A VERY LIGHT- ANSETT RAINS RAINFALL TOTALS IN CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RUN OUR SERVICE TERRITORY. ABOUT 5275% BELOW AVERAGE. IN TWENTY TWENTY WE SAW 70% MORE RED FLAG WARNING DAY SEVEN TWENTY NINETY. OF THOSE CONDITIONS COMBINED WITH MULTIPLE WAYS OF DANGEROUS SANTA ANA WINDS TRIGGERED THRESHOLDS FOR PUBLIC SAFETY PARRIS SHUTTLES FAR MORE FAR MORE THAN ANY OF US WOULD WANT. BUT EVEN UNDER THE SEVERE CIRCUMSTANCES WE DO SEE PROOF THAT OUR ACCELERATOR WILDFIRE MITIGATION WORK IS REDUCING THE SCALE CUSTOMER IMPACT OF THESE B. S. B. S. OFFENSE. FOR INSTANCE. IN 202046% OF THE CIRCUS DE ENERGIZED IN TWENTY NINETEEN DID NOT EXPERIENCE A P. S. P. S. ABOUT. THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF TWENTY TWENTY IMPACTED 25% OF YOUR CUSTOMERS AND THE LARGEST ONE IN TWENTY NINETEEN. THERE IS MUCH MORE TO DO AS IT BECOME CLEAR. TRAMLINE HERE IS MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THIS IS POSSIBLE IN PART BECAUSE OUR ABILITY TO SEGMENT CIRCUITS AND A RANGE OF CUSTOMERS CARD BY ALTERNATIVE ONES. WE DO THIS BASED ON SWITCHING PLAYBOOKS WE DEVELOPED FOR EVERY SINGLE CIRCUIT IN OUR HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS. AND TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPACT OF THIS. THE BENEFITS OF THIS APPROACH OUR LARGEST TWENTY TWENTY EVENT STARTED ON DECEMBER FOURTH WITH TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND CUSTOMERS IN SCOPE FOR POTENTIAL POWER SHUT OFF BY USING OUR PLAYBOOKS SAY MANY CIRCUITS AND MONITORING REAL TIME CONDITIONS ON THE GROUND POSSIBLY SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND CUSTOMERS ROUGHLY ONE POINT 6% OF OUR CUSTOMER BASE OR POWER DOWN INSTEAD OF THE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND. ASSEMBLY POINT WE WERE ABLE TO REDUCE THE SCALE THAT EVENT BY MORE THAN HALF. BY SEGMENTING OR CIRCUITS. OF COURSE ARE BILLION SEXUALIZE GREATER REDUCE THE NUMBER OF IMPACTED CUSTOMERS IS NOT MINIMISE HARDSHIPS FACED BY THOSE WHO LIVE. WORK YOU GO TO SCHOOL IN AREAS ARE WITHOUT POWER FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME. NOW WE KNOW FOR INSTANCE THAT SOME CUSTOMERS FACE BACK TO BACK U. S. B. AS WARNINGS. AND SHUT OFFS. NEED TAXPAYER TO SANTA ANA WINDS ARE REFERRED TO EARLIER. AND THIS IS WHY APPROVING OUR EXECUTION OF P. S. B. S. DOING OUT WEST WHERE POSSIBLE DOING IT BETTER. I'LL BE OUR CUSTOMERS THROUGH THESE EVENTS AND BE MORE TRANSPARENT IS PART OF OUR UPDATED WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLAN. MORE RECENTLY THESE ARE THE OBJECTIVES OF OUR P. S. B. S. ACTUAL PLAN WE'VE UNDERTAKEN FOLLOWING THE RECENT HEARINGS WITH CDC CALORIE S. CALIFORNICA. OUR CUSTOMERS DEMAND REFERENCE EARLIER THIS DISCUSSION. OUR GOAL IS ALWAYS TO USE POWERSHOT ALSO AS A LAST RESORT PROTECTING LIVES AND PROPERTY OF THE PEOPLE WE SERVE WHEN WEATHER AND FIRE DANGER CONDITIONS DEMANDED. IN FACT TWENTY NINETEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY. OPPOSE B. S. B. S. PATROLSSHOULD SIXTY INCIDENTS OF WIND RELATED DAMAGE THE COULD HAVE POTENTIALLY CAUSING NATION'S. THERE ARE LIKELY MANY MORE. NOW WE DO HAVE PROTOCOLS IN PLACE TO ENSURE P. S. B. S. IS IN FACT A MEASURE OF LAST RESORT. YOU HAD TO TROLLS CONDUCTED FORTY EIGHT HOURS IN ADVANCE TO REVIEW AND FORECAST REAL TIME WEATHER DATA. PROVIDED BY OUR EXTENSIVE NETWORK OF WEATHER STATIONS. SWITCHING RECONFIGURING CUSTOMERS THAT ARE NOT IN SCOPE FOR OUR SHUT OFF. AND MEETING WITH A PUBLIC AGENCY PARTNERS ARE NUMBER OF FACTORS AND FORMER DECISION TO DE ENERGIZE A CIRCUIT AT THE TIME DECISIONS MAY. NOW WITH THAT SAID WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT WE CAN IMPROVE ON I'M CONFIDENT OF THE WORKERS OUTLINED. OUR WATER MITIGATION PLAN. AND P. S. B. S. ACTUAL PLAN ALLOWS REDUCE THE FREQUENCY AND SCOPE ARGYROS. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A TASK FORCE REVIEWING SEVENTY TWO CIRCUITS IN OUR SERVICE AREA THAT HAVE BEEN MOST FREQUENTLY IMPACTED BY T. S. B. S. THOSE EXPERIENCING FOUR OR MORE DEREGISTRATION SINCE TWENTY NINETY. NOW WE PRIORITIZE THE CIRCUITS FOR XCELERATED MEDICATIONS WE CAN DEPLOY HEAD OF THIS YEAR'S THE FIRE SEASON. FOR EXAMPLE PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPEDITE OUR GREAT HARDING EFFORTS AND SOME OF THE CIRCUITS. WHICH IN TURN LACERATION WINDSPEED THRESHOLDS FOR DEREGISTRATION. LIKEWISE WHEN STYLING MORE AUTOMATED SWITCHING DEVICES TO ISOLATE AND DE ENERGIZED CIRCUITS MAKE SEGMENTS A SMALLER LEVEL. WE'VE ALREADY COMPLETED MULTIPLE CIRCUIT REVIEWS AND WE EXPECT TO SEE TANGIBLE BENEFITS THIS YEAR AS A RESULT. I DO A COMBINATION SWITCHING INSTALLATION COVER CONDUCTOR AND OTHER MEDICATIONS THERE'S A HIGH LIKELIHOOD WE'LL SEE SERVICE PROGRESS FROM REDUCE B. S. B. AS THE REGION. FULLY MITIGATE MEANING NO PSP RESIDENTS FOR SOME CIRCUITS. AS A HIGHLIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER RACES DISTRICT ZERO LIKES COMMUNITY IN THE CITY OF FONTANA IS NO LNGER SUBJECT TO P. S. P. S. OFFENSE AFTER ABLE TO RECONFIGURE AND MAKE UPGRADES TO OUR ELECTORAL SYSTEM. AND ARRANGE THE CIRCUIT SO IT NO LONGER HAS OVERHEAD. ASSETS IN HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS. ALSO IN THIS SO OFFER. AND AREA LIKE SIMI VALLEY. MAHOOD ARTIST IDEAS B. S. ONE OF THE AREAS WHERE WE BEEN THE MOST INNOVATIVE IN OUR YES YES YES PROGRAM IS SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. WE HAVE A HUNDRED SIXTY SIX HIGH DEFINITION CAMERAS WE GIVE US AND LOCAL FIRE AUTHORITIES I SPENT ALMOST ALL OF OUR HARDWARE CIRCUITS SO WE CAN SPOT FIRES EASILY EARLY RESPOND QUICKLY. NOW WE ALSO HAVE A THOUSAND WEATHER STATIONS IN OUR CIRCUITS TO PROVIDE LOCALIZED REAL TIME WEATHER DATA. IS PART OF OUR PS GAS ACTION PLAN WHILE FOR MITIGATION PLAN RALLY EVEN MORE THESE WEATHER STATIONS. THIS NEW START BILLION LOOK AT WIND AND RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR SPECIFIC CIRCUIT SEGMENTS. ALLOWING US TO BE FAR MORE TARGETED EXECUTING PARTIAL LOSS AS WE GO FORWARD. OVERALL THESE ENHANCE RESTORE WHETHER FEELS FORECASTING BETTER INFORMED. DECISION MAKING DURING P. S. B. S. OPERATIONS. RECEIVE ACCURACY AND PRECISION OF NOTIFICATIONS AS WELL AS REDUCE THE VARIANCE BETWEEN CUSTOMERS NOTIFIED AND DOES THE ENERGIZED. WELL THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF OUR PSP HAS ACTUAL PLAN IS ON REDUCING THE SCOPE AND DURATION OF THE SPS OFFENSE WE DO PLAN TO IMPROVE OUTRAGE IN COORDINATION WITH OUR PUBLIC SAFETY AND AGENCY PARTNERS. STARTING IN FEBRUARY WE BEGAN MEETING MONTHLY WITH CALLAWAY YES THE LION STANDARD OPERATING GUIDES. PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES. THIS MUST ONE GAUGE OUR PUBLIC SAFETY PARTNERS TO SOLICIT FEEDBACK R. P. S. B. S. PROTOCOLS AND PREPAREDNESS. AGAIN OUR GOAL IS TO USE PARTIALS AS A LAST RESORT TO PROTECT THE PROPERTY. AND THE PEOPLE THAT WE SEARCH. USING A PS PS IS A LAST RESORT MEANS THAT WILDFIRE PREVENTION IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR WORK YEAR ROUND. ESPS IN SPITE OF THE CHALLENGES POSED BY COMING NINETEEN WE MET OR EXCEEDED NEARLY ALL THE GOALS THAT ARE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FOR MITIGATION PLAN. INCLUDING INSTALLING OVER NINE HUNDRED SIXTY CIRCUIT MILES OF INSULATED WIRE OVER SIX THOUSAND BY RESISTING CALLS. AND ALMOST SIX HUNDRED WEATHER STATIONS WHILE REMOVING MORE THAN TWELVE THOUSAND HAZARD TREES THAT COULD FALL INTO POWER LINES AND LEAD TO AN AGAINST. I RECENTLY UPDATED WATER MITIGATION PLAN BUILDS ON THE WORK COMPLETED IN TWENTY TWENTY. AND LAYS OUT A PATH TO FURTHER REDUCE RISK ON OUR SYSTEM. MANY OF THESE ACTIVITIES WILL BE ACCELERATED TO R. P. S. B. AS ACTION PLAN AS WELL. REDUCING THE SCALE AND DURATION OF THE SPS EVENTS IS JUST ONE OF THE AREAS IN WHICH WE'RE COMMITTED. TO CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT. AND THIS TIME I LIKE TO ASK MY COLLEAGUE JILL. SURE HOW WE'VE MADE IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR CUSTOMER CARE AND COMMUNICATIONS- GERALDINE AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M JILL ANDERSON I'M THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT I SEE. AND I WANT TO START OUT MY THING AS THE HEAD OF CUSTOMER SERVICE. I READ ALL THE FRUSTRATED AND ANGRY POSTS THAT WE GET FROM CUSTOMERS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. I LISTENED DIRECTLY TO THE CUSTOMER PHONE CLLS THAT COME INTO OUR CONTACT CENTER I SPOKE IN IT MULTIPLE PUBLIC MEETINGS AND I'VE HEARD HOURS OF PUBLIC COMMENT. AND I HEAR OUR WHOLE TEAM HERE'S AND WE UNDERSTAND. THE OUTRAGE FROM THE CUSTOMERS WHO'VE BEEN IMPACTED ESPECIALLY THOSE MULTIPLE TIMES. AND WE UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATION AND CONFUSION THAT MANY. OF OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE SHARED. WE HAVE A LOT TO STILL IMPROVE BUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT THAT WE ARE THAT WE ARE PROUD OF THAT WE CAN PERCENT TWENTY NINETEEN. EXPANDED OUR USE OF COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS AND EXPANDED OUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH OUR COMMUNITIES DURING PS PS EVENTS WE'VE- IMPROVED OUR WEBSITE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM TWENTY NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY. BUT I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT WE HEAR OUR CUSTOMERS WE HEAR OUR REGULATORS WE HEAR EACH OF YOU. AND THAT WE ARE WORKING ON AND COMMITTED TO IMPROVING OUR CUSTOMERS EXPERIENCE I'M FULLY COMMITTED TO THAT. IN ABASED ON THE FEEDBACK FROM OUR CUSTOMERS SPECIFICALLY AND ALSO FROM THE REGULATORS WE KNOW THERE'S A MULTIPLE AREAS THAT WE HAVE TO OF ALL THE AND IT HAS TO BE DONE VERY QUICKLY WE ARE MAKING CHANGES THAT ARE GOING TO BE IN PLACE BEFORE THE NEXT FIRE SEASON. CENTRAL TO THAT AND YOU HEARD SOME OF THE STATISTICS ALREADY OUR NOTIFICATIONS. PROVIDING CUSTOMERS TIMELY AND ACCURATE AND ACTIONABLE INFORMATION ESPECIALLY DURING EMERGENCIES LIKE PS PS IS OUR TOP PRIORITY. WE'RE ADDRESSING RIGHT NOW WITH SOME OF THE ROOT CAUSES ARE FOR Y. MESSAGES IN THE PAST HAVE CREATED CUSTOMER CONFUSION. LIKE TOO MANY NOTICES OR COME SOME CUSTOMERS HAVE RECEIVED MESSAGES THAT ARE ACCURATE AND RELEVANT TO MULTIPLE CIRCUITS THAT ARE IN THEIR AREA BUT NIGHT MIGHT NOT BE SPECIFIC TO THE CIRCUIT THAT SERVES THEIR HOUSE. WE HAVE TO IMPROVE THESE NOTICES AND IN THE ACTION PLAN THAT PHIL MENTIONED THAT WE FILED IN FEBRUARY IN HIS CENTRAL THEME FOR US WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF DOING OUR INTENT AND REVIEW OF THE PROCESS AND COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE COMMISSION WHEN WE MIGHT WANT TO MODIFY THE NUMBER OF MESSAGES THAT ARE CURRENTLY REQUIRED. AND WE'RE MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE DESIGNING THIS BASED ON CUSTOMER FEEDBACK SO THAT IT CAN BE EFFECTIVE IN MEET THE NEEDS OF THE CUSTOMERS AS THEY EXPLAIN. TO US. IN ADDITION THE NOTIFICATIONS ANOTHER AREA IT'S TRULY IMPORTANT TO US IS MAKING SURE THAT OUR CUSTOMERS ARE PREPARED. FOR ANY EMERGENCY WE KNOW THAT WEATHER CONDITIONS ARE JUST GOING TO GET MORE EXTREME. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT OUR GREAT HARDENING UPGRADES TO MINIMIZE THE YOU DISAPPEAR YES. IT AND THAT'S A MULTI YEAR INVESTMENT PROCESS AND SO WE ARE HELPING OUR CUSTOMERS IN THE MEANTIME BUILD RESILIENCY FOR THEIR HOMES AND BUILDING RESILIENCY FOR. THEIR COMMUNITIES. I'VE BEEN PART OF THAT IS MINIMIZED THE IMPACT OF PS PS AND SO I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TWO AREAS IN PARTICULAR. I WON THE PRESIDENT BACHELOR MENTIONED ALREADY ARE CRITICAL CARE BATTERY BACKUP PROGRAM WE LAUNCHED THIS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YEAR LAST YEAR AND INITIALLY FOCUSED ON OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION. I WOULD CHOOSE WE HAVE DESIGNATED AS CRITICAL CARE WITHIN MEDICAL BASELINE WE HAVE ALREADY EXPANDED THIS OFFERING NOW TO ALL OF THE ELIGIBLE MEDICAL BASELINE CUSTOMERS FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE'VE LAUNCHED MARKETING AND OUTREACH TO THOSE CUSTOMERS JUST IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS WE'RE BUILDING ON THE LESSONS THAT WE LEARNED IN TWENTY TWENTY TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE. CREATED AND WE HAVE TO AT TIMES BE PERSISTENT IN ORDER TO MAKE SURETHAT WE'RE REACHING CUSTOMERS AND INSTALLING BATTERIES THAT WE KNOW. PROVIDE SO MUCH BENEFIT FOR THEM. ON THE COMMUNITY SIDE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL COMMUNITIES OF PRESIDENT BADGER MENTIONS THE NEED VALLEY. I'VE BEEN THINKING MULTIPLE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED MULTIPLE TIMES DURING EVENTS. SO WE HAVE ALREADY STARTED WORKING DIRECTLY WITH THOSE COMMUNITIES TO MAKE RESILIENCY ZONES WHERE WE ARE ABLE TO DEPLOY BACKUP GENERATION TO POWER LOCAL. MARKETS ARE GAS STATIONS ARE YOU KNOW A BUSINESS CENTER. DURING A PS PS EVENT. AND YOU KNOW AS AS I WRAP UP THERE'S TO CUSTOMER INTERACTIONS AROUND PS PS THAT I WANT. TO SHARE WITH YOU. THE STRAIGHT HOW. MATT JANUARY EVENT WHICH HAS WAS AS MENTIONED BEFORE. WEATHER EVENTS AND MUCH STEP. WHEN WE THOUGHT THE FORECAST. COMING THAT WE WERE GONNA GET. EXTREMELY HIGH WINDS. CLEAR AND DIRECT ENGAGEMENT IS REALLY IMPORTANT AS WE ALL WORK TOGETHER AS A TEAM TO KEEP THE PUBLIC SAFE SO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SURE HOLDEN BY SHARE PATTERSON AND RESPECTED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE IN SESSION TODAY MY NAME IS A MONSTER BANG AND I'M PRIVILEGED TO BE PEONIES CHAMBERS COSTS ARE. I'M SURE IN ABOUT. TWENTY TWENTY SAFETY POWERSHOT EVENT. RENDON'S MOVE MAY TO LESSEN THE- HAS BEEN STATED OUR YOURSELF TROUBLED. AS ACTOR OF THE IMPACT OF U. S. B. BETWEEN TWO NINETEEN TO TWENTY ARMENIANS A SECOND WAY. FOR A LOT FEEDBACK. A LOT OF FEEDBACK- AND ACTED UPON THAT WE HAVE A LOT MORE WORK TO DO IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE I THINK GOING FORWARD WE'RE COMMITTED TO THAT AND I WILL ALSO. DISCUSS SOME OTHER FOCUS AREAS THAT WE HAVE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE I SPECIFICALLY SOME OF THE AREAS ARE HIGHLIGHTED BY PRESIDENT BADGER. IN HER OPENING REMARKS- AS- BILL HEARING TO NORTH COAST THE CLIMATE CHANGES ARE WE GOING TO SEE OUR THE WE DON'T AND WEIGH ACROSS THE WEST S. AND TWENTY TWENTY CALIFORNIA OREGON WASHINGTON ALL EXPERIENCED ON THE MOST ACTIVE IN DAMAGING WILDFIRE SEASONS IN THE HISTORY. TWENTY TWENTY ALONE THE LARGEST WILDFIRE SEASON WILL BE EXPERIENCE CLOSE TO HOME IN CALIFORNIA. IN FACT LET ME SERVICE TERRITORY. NEARLY THREE MILLION ACRES BURNED LAST YEAR WHICH WAS NEARLY THREE TIMES THE PRIOR THREE YEAR AVERAGE. MPD SERVICE TERRITORY ALONE HAS NEARLY TRIPLED. AS THE ELEVATED RISK A LOT OF FIRE FROM 15% TO MORE THAN FIFTY MORE THAN 50% OVER THE PAST DECADE. GIVEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN AUTHORIZED THE WERE SEEING IN THE BANK'S NAME THE FIRE SEASON. PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF REMAINS AN IMPORTANT BUT A MEASURE OF LAST RESORT OUR TOOL. FOR CUSTOMERS HI COMMITTEE SAFE. MOST OF RECOGNIZED THE LOSING POWER LIVES ESPECIALLY FOR CUSTOMERS WHO RELY ON ELECTRICITY FOR. LIFE SUSTAINING. SURVIVALIST IN TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND COMMUNITIES HELLO COMMUNITIES AND FINDING WAYS TO REDUCE THE IMPACT YES S. ADVANCED WITHOUT COMPROMISING SAFETY. AGAIN THERE'S- THAT WE LOOK AT PS PS AS A MEASURE OF LAST RESORT. WE HAVE SIX YES YES I MENTIONED TWENTY TWENTY THAT WOULD PROCEED WITH THE NATIONS ONE ALREADY THIS YEAR IN JANUARY WHICH HAS BEEN UNPRECEDENTED AND NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE IN OUR SERVICE TERRITORY. TWENTY NINETEEN- THE EVENT'S IMPACTED YOUR CUSTOMERS- AND OUR AVERAGE RESTORATION TIMES FOR FASTER. IN TWENTY TWENTY- WE IMPACTED TO SIMILAR WEATHER CONDITIONS IN TWENTY NINETEEN. AS MISS CARLA JACOB THOMAS ALSO STATED IN OUR- FAX. LARGEST DRIVER OF THIS REDUCTION WAS IMPROVED WEATHER FORECASTING THE ABILITY FOR US TO BE MUCH MORE GRANULAR IN DEVELOPING FOR US I'M TO TARGET- THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH WILDFIRES BLACK WE ALSO TARGET THE INTERNALIZATION FROM A P. S. P. S. PERSPECTIVE. BETTER TRANSMISSIONS. UP PROCESS. WE CONTINUE TO INVEST. IN OUR GENERATING STATION LIKE THE HUMBOLDT COUNTY GENERATING STATION THAT PROVIDES I WAS TO KEEP THE BUILDINGS NOW. ALSO THAT THAT THE TRANSMISSION LINES THAT ARE FEEDING PEOPLE VOTE COUNTY COMMUNITY AT THEIR IMPACTED OTHERS ALL THE P. S. P. S. THAT COMMUNITY I CAN BE SUSTAINED- OR- THE DURATION OF THE EVENT. ENDOSOMAL TO WHAT MISTER HERRINGTON- HIGHLIGHTS FOR US HE R. WITH THE CAN YOU TO MAKE IN THE GOING TO. LIKE SOCIALIZATION DEVICES. TEMPORARY MIGHT. I IN ALL OF THOSE- CAME TO BEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY THAT HELP WITH THE REDUCTION OF FIFTY FIVE PERCENT. OF YOUR CUSTOMERS IMPACTED. HOW ALSO REDUCE THE AMOUNT IT TOOK SEE IF YOU POWER AFTER THE WEATHER HAD PASSED BY NEW 40% I TO DO- WE MOBILIZE MORE THAN THIRTY TWO HUNDRED QUALIFIED ON THE GROUND PERSONNEL. SUPPORTING INSPECTION EFFORTS. OVER THE COURSE OF THE SIX FORMER BANDS WE IDENTIFIED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN DAMAGES OR HAZARDS THAT OTHERWISE HAVE YOU NOT THE OTHER GUYS GOING TO POTENTIALLY. YIELDED OR RESULTED IN ADDITION OR A SPARK. WE DEPLOYED SIXTY FIVE HELICOPTERS TO INSPECT THE LINES FROM THE ERROR- WE ALSO DEPLOYED AN AIRPLANE THAT WAS QUITE A LOT OF TECHNOLOGY SO THAT WE CAN INSPECT THE LIGHTS AT NIGHT. AND NOT LOSE THAT TIME I WAS THE ADVERSE WEATHER FASTER SERVICE TERRITORY. WE PROVIDED OUR CUSTOMERS BETTER INFORMATION WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO WE RECOGNIZE THAT AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE COMMITTED TO DOING. OUR BOTH BEFORE DURING AND AFTER. PS PS EVENTS. ARE WE- MORE THAN TWELVE IN CATIONS. SIXTEEN TO PROVIDE. PROVIDED MORE THAN FIVE- PACKAGES ARE PARTNERING UP WITH SCHOOL BANKS. I'M TO THE POINT THAT THAT MADE HAD MORE THAN SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED OR MORE ABOUT. FROM TO. ARE VULNERABLE BASED CUSTOMER. HI AND WELCOME TO DOING. I'LL COME UPON THE IN A SENSE. I AM MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED CUSTOMERS THAT WE SERVE THE PARTNERSHIPS WITH A MULTITUDE OF DIFFERENT COMMITTEE BASED ORGANIZATIONS. OUR ENGAGE WITH TO. SUPPORT THEM WITH HOTEL VOUCHERS TRANSPORTATION AND OTHER CRITICAL RESOURCES- WE USE A MULTITUDE OF DIFFERENT AVENUES TO PARTNER AND ENGAGE WITH OUR AGENCIES MOVE BACK OF WORKING SESSIONS WE COLLECTED THIRTY TWO WORKING SESSIONS OF TWENTY TWENTY. MANY OF OUR CITIES COUNTIES- TRIBAL COMMUNITIES- AND WILL BE HOLDING MORE SESSIONS IF ALL THIS YEAR- WE'VE GOT A LISTING SESSIONS. I WOULD HAVE THIRTY SIX- FOLLOWING THE TWENTY NINETEEN PS PS EVENTS AND WE'VE ALREADY DONE FORTY ONE EVENTS- MOSTLY SESSION PERSPECTIVE POSTED TWENTY TWENTY EVENTS. WERE TAKING ALL THAT INFORMATION ALL THAT FEEDBACK OF THE GIFT OF FEEDBACK TO COMPUTER COUPON. HOW WE SUPPORT OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR COMMUNITIES. I WILL STARTED ONLINE SURVEYS- TO AGENCIES ARE IMPACTED BY THE EVENTS. THAT YOU BEGAN THIS PRACTICE MIDWAY LAST YEAR- AND WE'VE CONDUCTED THREE SURVEYS TO DATE AND THAT THE FEEDBACK THAT WE RECEIVED IS BY MORE THAN 89% OF THE AGENCIES THAT WERE SURVEYED. THE EVENTS IN TWENTY TWENTY GOOGLE TWENTY NINETEEN. BUT THAT JUST TO REINFORCE. THAT WE HAVE MORE WORK TO BE ABLE. SOMETIMES TO THAT TWENTY ONE FOCUS THAT WE- THE LAW ARE SAFE EFFORTS AS ALSO OUTLINED THEM. THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FIVE EDUCATION. WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AND IMPROVE THEM EVERY YEAR TO REPLY THE LESSONS LEARNED- BRING TO IN. INCLUDING FEEDBACK FROM ACROSS ARE TO. OF THIS. AREA FOR US OF THE- YEAH YES AND THAT'S A TWENTY. THIS CAN TO IN UPON ELECTRICAL WHICH IS. THE INSTALL. OF BORDER. OF MORE MATURE AND FIFTY. ALSO GOOD TO UPGRADE. ON MICHAEL. WE CAN BRING TO OUR TEMPORARY CHEN PEOPLE ON THE STRENGTH. CORSON YES YES- ON THE- FROM FOR TWENTY THE COOKING PART. WITH CITIES K. AND- TO THE BATTERY. FOR BETTER. AND SUPPORT. FOR CPAS TO THE THAT PRESENT BADGER- WE ARE TO STAY UP FOR BATTERIES PROGRAM WHERE THEY DOUBLE THAT. TWENTY TWO. ALL AND REALLY- WITH THE BOCA ON MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE. THAT THAT'S AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE COME BACK WILL BE FINE MORE I THOUGHT BUT THIS ARE CARD ESTIMATE. BY THIRTY. HOW WITH OUR SERVICE FOR- IN TO THE IN. SHE WAS THE AGENCY GALLAGHER PROBLEM. WE HAVE ONE OF GROUP LOCAL YOU HAVE. TO ORDER AND- OUR IN. PROTOCOL SO WE HAVE SPECIAL FIELD ON THE IMPROVEMENTS WHICH WOULD TO BE A- THE WE GET INTO THE TWENTY. ONE PS PSC'S. ALL OF THE- IN REGARDS TO THE CUSTOMER IMPROVEMENTS- WE'VE GOT FOCUS ON IMPROVING OUR CONSISTENCY ACROSS LOCATION ACCURACY I WE MADE GREAT STRIDES IN TWENTY TWENTY AS COMPARED TO TWENTY NINETEEN I SPORTFISHING ACCURACY GROUP OF ABOUT 90% IN TWENTY NINETEEN MORE THAN 99% OF TWENTY TWENTY WE HAVE MORE TO DO- OUR MAKING MY MODIFICATIONS MARKETS. BASED ON. AND ALSO PRODUCT PROCESS ALSO THAT WE GET SOME BY THAT MAY COME OUT OF SCHOOL BUT IT WAS OF WHICH THAT ARE FROM THE INITIAL FOR EIGHT HOURS OF THE NO THERE ARE OF SCHOOL BECAUSE YOU. TO STAY WITH. ALSO GOING TO CONTINUE OUR- WITH THE NETWORK OF THE COMMUNICATION OR NOT. WHICH INCLUDES BANKS AND LIKE OR NOT THEY- WILL NOT BE. IN THE- LIVING CENTER. IN ADDITION TO ALL THE WORK WE'RE DOING TO POOREST WE ARE. TO MONITOR THE WEATHER. ALL HIGH DEF CAMERA THAT YOU OF THE SO LIKE IF. FOR AWARENESS PROVIDE MORE ACT. NOT LINE AS A WHOLE. LOOKING AT P. S. P. S. ARE ON A MORE INTIMATE BASIS AS WE STARTED. HARD TO MAKE GREAT PROGRESS. IN DOING THAT AND ALSO THE SAME TIME FRIEND FIND GREAT THROUGHOUT. SO THAT WE CAN TO BE MORE TARA. AND REFUSED NEED FOR PSP- THAT- OVER TIME I WANT TO TAKE ALL- ARE. VERY EXCITED ABOUT WHAT'S USED IN AUSTRIA OF RAPID ALL CURRENT LIMITER. AUTOMATICALLY AND- REDUCES A SMALL ON THE REST OF THE- A LOT OF POTENTIAL FOR. THAT I UNDERSTAND. WITHOUT AT ONE OF OUR CIRCUITS THIS. AND WILL BE COMPLETING BE- OPERATION COMMISSIONING OF THAT JULY OF THIS YEAR NOT TO BE A LOT. A GOOD GROUP RIGHT- TO EXPAND. I'LL BE ON THE YEAR. ON YOU AGAIN. SHAREHOLDERS. GOOD AFTERNOON HAS ONE TOO QUICK SOUNDCHECK AND CAN YOU GUYS HEAR ME. AND HEAR YOU. THANK YOU- THANK YOU- CHAIR HOLDEN VICE CHAIR AND- COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JOHN JENKINS I'M STANDING IN GAS ELECTRIC SO VICE PRESIDENT OF ELECTRIC SYSTEM OPERATIONS AND WHILE PERMEATION- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO. BE HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS THE EXECUTION OF OUR PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF PROGRAM. OF PERSONAL START OFF WITH JUST A BRIEF REVIEW OF THIS PAST FIRE SEASON- WHICH OF. FROM THE COMMENTS YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD WAS PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING- THIS LAST FIRE SEASON. FOR THE REGION IN SAN DIEGO RIGHT ITS FIRST RE FLAG WARNING- IN SEPTEMBER WHICH IS REALLY EARLY FOR US WE'RE TYPICALLY MORE OF- OCTOBER EARLY NOVEMBER. TIME FRAME FOR REPLY WARNINGS US WE HAD A COUPLE IN SEPTEMBER- THEN THE RED FLAG WARNING SEASON ALSO GOT OFF TO A PLATE AND- GOING ALL THE WAY INTO JANUARY WITH TWO EVENTS- IN MID JANUARY- SO- WE HAD AN EXTENDED RED FLAG WARNING SEASON. WE ALSO HAD A MORE FREQUENCY OF RED FLAG WARNING ADVANCE- WE AVERAGE ABOUT THREE PER YEAR- WE HAD ELEVEN IN THAT SEPTEMBER THROUGH JANUARY TIME FRAME- AND NOT ONLY DID WE SEE A LONGER SEASON WITH MORE FREQUENCY OF EVENTS BUT WE ALSO EXPERIENCED IN AN EXTREMELY STRONG EVENT- ONE. ONE IN PARTICULAR THAT WAS ON DECEMBER SECOND THROUGH THE FOURTH. I JUST WANNA SPEND ONE MINUTE AND GIVE YOU SOME STATISTICS FROM HER MARCHING THEM BECAUSE THIS IS OVER HALF OF THE CUSTOMER HOURS THAT THAT- DIRECTOR JACOBS MENTIONED IN OUR STATISTICS. FOR TWENTY TWENTY. WE HAVE TWO HUNDRED WHETHER. FOR LOCATED- IN A SERVICE. NOW MOST WHICH HAVE BEEN. WEATHER DATA FOR OVER A DECADE- TO PROVIDE US WITH SITUATIONAL AWARENESS REGARDING POTENTIAL FIRE WEATHER- FOR TWELVE TWELVE THROUGH TWELVE FOR THE AVERAGE TOP AGHAST AT TWENTY WEATHER STATIONS BUT SAW THE STRONGEST WINDS WAS SEVENTY ONE MILES PER HOUR- NOT ALWAYS NEXT TIME WAS WHEN I WAS THE AVERAGE. OF THE PEAK OF WIND AT THE WEATHER STATION THAT SAW THE HIGHEST WIND WAS NINETY FOUR MILES PER HOUR AT ARE STILL WHO WEATHER STATION- ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SIX OVER TWO HUNDRED TWENTY WEATHER STATIONS SO OVER HALF. ARE RECORDED WIND SPEEDS IN THE NINETY NINTH PERCENTILE MEANING THAT THEY ONLY SEE THAT ONE SPEED 1% OF THE TIME- AND THEN- EVEN MORE- COMPELLING THE MAP WAS FORTY THREE OF THE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY WEATHER STATIONS SO. A ROUGHLY HIGH WITH OVER I LIKE I SAID TEN YEARS OF WEATHER DATA THAT WE'VE BEEN COLLECTING. A 20% SAW THEIR ALL TIME RECORD BROKEN IN THAT ONE EVENT- JUST PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE PERSPECTIVE WE SAW RECORD GUSTS OF SIXTY MILES PER HOUR I DEL MAR ON THE COAST I JUST GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF HOW WIDESPREAD THE ABOUT WAS FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE FAMILIAR WITH- THE SAN DIEGO REGION- THIS BECAUSE THIS HUGE NEED TO NOTIFY NINETY FIVE THOUSAND CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS. OF THE POTENTIAL OF PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF- WE ENDED UP THE ENERGIZING SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND A LITTLE OVER THAT OF THEIR OF THOSE CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS- WE OPEN TEN COMMUNITY RESOURCE. CENTERS AS A RESULT AND SONYA B. TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED CARS DRIVE THROUGH OUR COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTER WE WERE NOT. A DRIVE THRU FORMAT DUE TO THE PANDEMIC SITUATION- THIS WAS MORE TRAFFIC THAN WE'VE- SEEN EVEN AND NOT OF THE WALK UP TYPE- COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS THAT WE HAVE IN THE PAST- SO. HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT WE'RE USING THIS TOOLS AS A MEASURE OF LAST RESORT- I CAN TELL YOU THAT THAT WE- ESTY GENIE AND I PERSONALLY- TAKE THE UTMOST CARE WHEN MAKING THESE DECISIONS- WE DO NOT TAKE THESE DECISIONS LIGHTLY- EVEN IN THE A LARGE EVENT IN DECEMBER. WE DO ENERGIZED OVER EIGHTY DIFFERENT CIRCUIT SEGMENTS TO MAKE UP THAT SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND CUSTOMER ACCOUNT NUMBER- THAT IS OVER EIGHTY SEPARATE DECISIONS THEY WERE MAKING USING INFORMATION FOR EVERYONE OF THOSE DECISIONS FOR MORE WEATHER STATIONS. TEN YEARS OF HISTORICAL DATA THE ABILITY TO GET WINDS GUSTS REACHED DOWN AT THE THIRTY SECOND INTERVAL LEVEL- WHICH WAS- IMPROVEMENT- IN TWENTY TWENTY TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN OUR WEATHER STATIONS. USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO INFORM FORECASTING MODELS ARE ALSO USING MACHINE LEARNING- WE HAVE ESTROGEN INSPIRE POTENTIAL INDEX. TO ASSESS THE CONDITIONS. WERE VERY PARTICULAR FIRE WEATHER EVENTS- WE ALSO HAVE A VEGETATION RISK INDEX WHICH IDENTIFIES FOR SPECIFIC AREAS- HISTORICAL VEGETATION CONTACTS SPECIES OF TREES THE PROXIMITY OF THE TREES TO THE LINES. OF GROWTH RATES OF THE TREES ALL THIS GIVES US- OF EDUCATION RISKY NEXT FOR EVERYONE. OF THE SEGMENTS THAT THAT I WAS DESCRIBING. AND ALSO FEEL OBSERVER. AS WELL AS PIECES MACRAME ALL GO TO DO. MAKE PROCESS- AFTER AFTER THE PATROLS DURING THE STRONG EVENTS WAITED A FIVE FOURTEEN ISSUES THAT NEEDED TO BE CORRECTED PRIOR TO US BEING ABLE TO SAFELY REENERGIZE THE SYSTEM- THESE RANGE FROM VEGETATION AND DEBRIS AND OUR LINES TO- YEAH BROKEN CROSS ARM- I WANTED TO WALK THROUGH THAT WORST OF INTERESTED TO KIND OF PAINT THE PICTURE BUT I ALSO WANT TO GIVE YOU A PICTURE OF WHAT TRANSPIRED THE REST OF THE RED FLAG WARNING SEASON- I MENTIONED WE HAD ELABORATE BY MORNING ADVANCE- AND TO. FURTHER ILLUSTRATE ONLY USING THIS IS A MEASURE OF LAST RESORT WE- USED PUBLIC SAFETY PARTIAL OFTEN IN SIX OF THE ELEVEN EVENTS- WE THE NEXT LARGEST ONE FROM THE SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND CUSTOMER COUNT WAS FIFTEEN THOUSAND CUSTOMERS- THEN WE HAD TWO EVENTS THAT WERE LESS THAN TEN THOUSAND CUSTOMERS. ONE EVENT THAT WAS FOUR HUNDRED CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS AND THEN ONE OF AND IT WAS ACTUALLY LESS THAN A HUNDRED CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS AND- THOSE ARE MORE ARE TYPICAL OF PS PS- ADVANCING IMPACTS- SO EVEN TELLS. OF THE TREATMENTS. WERE WORKING OVER ONCE IN THE PAST. OUR BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THIS BETTER SHORT TERM ACCORDED NOT EXPERIENCE A SIGNIFICANT WHILE CAUSED BY OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND IN FACT WE WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO ONLY HAVE- ONE SIGNIFICANT OF. THAT IMPACT OUR SERVICE TERRITORY NOW WITH THE VALLEY FIRE IN SEPTEMBER- HAVING SAID ALL THIS WE UNDERSTAND THAT PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF IT IS AN IMPACT AND THE SEVERE IMPACTED COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE- WE'RE STRIVING TO MINIMIZE THAT IMPACT SO WE'RE GOING TO. CONTINUE TO EXAMINE WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN DO THAT BY ACTIVELY- FIRST WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO PARTNER TRANSMISSION SYSTEM- AS AS OF THE END OF 202098% OF OUR TRANSMISSION SYSTEM INTERIOR THREE- HAS BEEN HARDENED SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. 83% OF THE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM OVERALL IN THE CHIPPY HAS BEEN HARDENED- THIS ALLOWS US TO KEEP OUR TRANSMISSION SYSTEM ENERGIZED- DURING OUR WEATHER CONDITIONS WHICH KEEPS LARGE POPULATIONS ENERGIZED AND- KEEPING US FROM THE ENERGIZING ENTIRE SUBSTATIONS THAT MAY NOT NEED TO BE DE ENERGIZED. ARE OTHERWISE- WE'RE ALSO GOING TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND AND WEBER JR SITUATIONAL AWARENESS TOOLS- EVERY YEAR WE GO THROUGH LESSONS LEARNED AND FIND NEW PLACES WHERE WE WOULD LIKE TO INSTALL WEATHER STATIONS. ASSOCIATED SEXUALIZING DEVICES WHICH INCREASE OUR GRANULARITY- I'M ALSO GOING TO CONTINUE TO ENHANCE OUR- FORECASTING WITH. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING. HI WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE THE HARDEST SYSTEM WE HARD OVER TWO HUNDRED THIRTY OVERHEAD MILES IN TWENTY TWENTY- WE'RE GOING TO AT LEAST THAT SAME NUMBER THIS YEAR- WE- AND IN THE WORST OF THE WORST AREAS- UNDERGROUND AND OVERHEAD AND- INFRASTRUCTURE. FOR THIRTY MILES- WE'RE GOING TO BE CONTINUING THAT- SAYING WHAT WHAT BECKER IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. I'M TWENTY TWENTY WE DEPLOYED FOR NEW MICRO GRIDS- AND IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE'RE GONNA ADD TWO MORE- TO ENERGIZED SOME TOWN CENTERS IN OUR- BACK. COMMUNITY USED. AND I ALWAYS LIKE TO ILLUSTRATE THAT WITH THESE IT'S NOT JUST THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS IT'S THE TYPE OF CUSTOMERS THAT YOU RE ENERGIZING HE'S OUR TOWN CENTRES- SO A LOT OF THESE PLACES JUST HAVE AN INTERSECTION OR TWO THAT. IS BASICALLY THE TOWN CENTER SO IT'S GOING TO KEEP FOR FREE STORES SCHOOLS- URGENT CARE CENTERS GAS STATIONS- WITH OUR DURING THE SITUATIONS SO. EVEN IF WE'RE NOT MITIGATING IMPACTS DIRECTLY BY ENERGIZING HOMES WERE MITIGATING IMPACT BY. PROVIDING CRITICAL GOODS AND SERVICES TO PEOPLE INSPECT ENTRY AREAS- WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR CUSTOMER RESILIENCY PROGRAMS- IN TWENTY TWENTY WE- OFFERED OVER THIRTEEN HUNDRED- PORTABLE BATTERY STORAGE UNITS FOR MEDICAL BASED ON CUSTOMERS. THIS WAS EVERY CUSTOMER THAT HAD EXPERIENCED A PS PS EVENT IN TWENTY NINETEEN- WE HAD 85% ACCEPTANCE RATE ON ON OUR OFFERS- WE'RE PLANNING TO EXPAND THAT PROGRAM TO OVER TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE AGAIN TARGETING MEDICAL BASED ON CUSTOMERS- WE ALSO STARTED. A GENERATOR REBATE PROGRAM IN TWENTY TWENTY SO CERTAIN QUALIFYING CUSTOMERS- IN- ARE HARPER TRAIT DISTRICT ARE WRONG. PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF- WERE GIVEN A 50% REBATE A THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR VALUE TO PURCHASE A PORTABLE GENERATOR. IF THEY WERE QUALIFYING LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS IT WAS A 75% REBATE OR FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLAR VALUE- TO GO PURCHASE A PORTABLE GENERATOR- AND THEN JUST ONE LAST THE- INNOVATION IN THAT I WOULD LIKE TO. LEAVE YOU A THIS WERE FOR TO- WHAT WE'RE DOING AND TWENTY TO COME TO REDUCE RISK CASH FOR WILDFIRE BUT ALSO. REDUCE THE IMPACTS OF PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF- WE'RE USING- A RISK AND THE RISK MODELING TOOL RIVER WE REFER TO AS WINGS ARE WILD OUR NEXT GENERATION SYSTEM- THIS IS A RISK MODELING TOOL THAT SG USES FOR OUR PROJECTS SELECTION PRIORITIZATION. BY QUANTIFYING THE RISK REDUCTION BUT DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES EXHIBIT. BUT THE IMPORTANT PART OF THIS CONTROLS THAT ALSO INCORPORATES THE RISK OF PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF IN THE MODEL- PRIOR TO THIS SDG WAS SELECTING A PRIORITIZING PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS BASED ON THEIR ABILITY TO REDUCE THE RISK OF ALL PARAMOUNT. A WHICH DID NOT NECESSARILY BENEFIT PS PS REDUCTION- BUT THIS NEUTRALS TAKING BOTH ASPECTS INTO ACCOUNT SO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR PATH GOING. FORWARD FOR A LOT OF OUR PROGRAMS- WITH THAT I WILL- CAN. MY IN MY COMMENT HERE WILL GLADLY- ANSWERED QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE. WELL THANK YOU AND- AND LET ME JUST AGAIN THANK ALL OF YOU REPRESENTS OF THE CPUC AND PRESENT BACHELOR AND- THE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES- THAT IS THE UNIQUE ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITY UNIQUE TO THIS COMMITTEE. TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT- AND HEARING SUCH AS WERE HAVING TODAY- TO NOT ONLY LOOK AT THE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AND HOW THEY ADDRESS ISSUES AS WE ARE FOCUSING TODAY ON. PS PS EVENTS BUT ALSO THE REGULATORY AGENCIES AS THEY OVERSEE AND REGULATE. THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES SO WE HAVE THIS IMPORTANT ROLE WHERE- CITIZEN ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES WE ARE KIND OF IN THAT ROLE OF MAKING SURE. THAT EVERYONE WHO HAS JURISDICTION RESPONSIBILITY IS DOING THE UP MOST- TO MEET THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES AND AS I MADE REFERENCE IN MY- OPENING COMMENTS- AS THE COMMENTS WERE BEING SURE BACK TO PRESIDENT VETERAN CPC ON HER BASED ON HER LETTER- THERE HAS BEEN SORT OF A- CLEAR PAPER TRAIL OF WHAT. A UTILITIES AND SOME OF YOU ARE DOING X. OR ARE MAKING GREAT PROGRESS- LONG WAY TO GO A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE STILL OTHERS ARE- HAVE SHOWN AT LEAST HERE RECENTLY A STRUGGLING. MOMENTS AND SO WE'RE WE HEAR OF PRESENTATIONS AND I THINK YOUR PRESENTATIONS LAID OUT TECHNICALLY A LOT OF IMPORTANT- NEXT STEPS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE TAKING. IT WE DON'T WANT TO FALL INTO THAT CATEGORY OF AGAIN WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WHAT WE'RE PLANNING TO DO. AND THEN WHEN THE MOMENT HITS YOU DON'T PERFORM. AND SO I GUESS MY- QUESTION- TO THE I. O. USE AND IT'S FOR ALL OF YOU. AS WE MOVE BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. HOW TO ASK QUESTIONS. IS WHAT DO YOU THINK. THIS COMMITTEE OR THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY SHOULD DO% WHEN A UTILITY REPEATEDLY FAILS TO MEET ITS RESPONSIBILITIES AND EXECUTION OF P. S. P. S. EVENTS. I HAVE TO RUSH TO THE MIGHT. I AM. CAROLYN THIS IS A FULL ARTICLE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON FIRST I WANT TO REITERATE SOMETHING- JOHN ANDERSON FOR MEDICINE ALSO SAID- JUST HOW FIRST OF ALL WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE WITH THIS COMMITTEE HERE TODAY- HERE TO SPEAKERS AND COLLABORATE ON WHAT WE THINK IS THE CHALLENGE OF OUR TIME RIGHT NOW WHICH IS CLIMATE CHANGE AND CONSEQUENTLY WILDFIRE- OFFERS RICH. COMING FROM THE- ASAKO CHANGE- I RECOGNIZE MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE- CHAIRMAN HOLDEN AYE AYE I WANT TO SAY THAT I THINK- NEED GATE MORE HAVING HERE TODAY IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT AS WE- ADJUST OUR PLANS AND COMMUNICATE WHAT WE ARE DOING. TO DO EVEN BETTER AND TO FIX THINGS THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE ARE WRONG I ALONG WITH KILLS- I HAVE HEARD. MANY MANY OBSERVATIONS FROM OUR CUSTOMERS- FROM OUR- STAKEHOLDERS FROM OUR PARTNERS ABOUT THE NEED TO DO BETTER I THINK THIS- COMMITTEE CAN HELP IN THAT REGARD. BY HOLDING THESE HEARINGS- HI YOU FORM FOR US TO DISCUSS ANY FRAME UNDER. WHERE WE'RE NOT MEETING THE NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS OF THIS COMMITTEE. I DO BELIEVE THERE IS A ROLE IN COLLABORATION HERE- WITH ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS AND THIS INCLUDES THE LEGISLATURE IN CALIFORNIA- BECAUSE MUCH OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS UNIQUE I JUST WANT TO REMIND. ALL OF US THAT IT'S IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THAT WE HAVE SEEN A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE AS EVIDENCED BY THE SIZE AND PREVALENCE OF WILDFIRES. WE ARE GAME DEALING WITH SOMETHING THAT'S VERY NEW- IN THIS CERTAINLY IN MY CAREER-THE NOTION OF THE ENERGIZING CUSTOMERS THIS IS JUST NOT HOW WHERE. FORGIVE ME HOME WIRED I MEAN WE LIVE TO KEEP OUR CUSTOMERS ENGAGED WE ARE MANDATE MANAGED OUR PERFORMANCE METRICS THAT HOLD US ACCOUNTABLE AND SHOW HOW WELL WE ARE KEEPING OUR CUSTOMERS ENERGIZED. SO I THINK THIS KIND OF- OF DISCUSSION IS HELPFUL AND I ALSO WANT TO REITERATE OUR COMMITMENT. TO CONTINUE TO DO BETTER DO YOU USE THE S. P. S. LAST TO DO IT BETTER WHEN WE HAVE TO DO IT TO MAKE IT LESS PAINFUL FOR CUSTOMERS WHEN IT HAS TO HAPPEN. AND ALSO TO BE MUCH MORE TRANSPARENT AND CLEAR IN AND HOW AND WHY WE. ARE EXECUTING YES YES. AGAIN APPRECIATE THE I THINK THAT IS- IS WHAT WE RECEIVE THAT IN THE SPIRIT OF WHICH IS GIVEN AND WE- LOOK FORWARD TO COOPERATING- AND- COLLABORATING- GOING FORWARD AND I GUESS. YOU KNOW THE REAL. THRUST BEHIND THE QUESTION WAS WHAT HAPPENS. AT THE END OF THIS YEAR AND WE FIND THAT- THERE IS A- DEFICIENCY- AND I'LL I'LL JUST- NOT NECESSARILY FORCE YOU TO ANSWER THAT PART OF IT AND WENT IN TERMS OF WHAT WE SHOULD DO BUT I THINK. THE IDEA OF. RECOGNIZING THAT AS THE YEAR BECAUSE THIS YEAR GOES FORWARD AND AS WE MOVE INTO THE FUTURE YEARS WE DO WANT TO SEE- NOT JUST INCREMENTAL INCREASES IN EFFICIENCY AND- AN EMPLOYMENT TATIAN OF WHAT YOU'VE LAID OUT. BUT WE WANT TO SEE QUICK- EFFICIENT MARKET. IMPROVEMENT SO THAT WE ARE GOING TO THEN LOOK TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE- EARLIER ON THAT WE CAN START TO MOVE AWAY FROM. THE INTERNALIZATION AS A TECHNIQUE THAT WE ARE NOW ACTIVELY SEEING RESULTS. AND THAT TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES ARE BEING PROPERLY EXECUTED. AND SO THEREFORE AS WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO HOLD ALL OF YOU TO THE- TO THE- THE GOAL. THAT DE ENERGIZING LINES BECOME SOMETHING THAT. NOT ONLY DO IT WHEN NECESSARY AND JUST IN PARTICULAR INSTANCES BUT IT BECOMES NOT NECESSAY AT ALL. LET ME DISCUSSES THE QUESTION TO SEE IF YOU SEE AND THEN I'M GOING TO TURN TO OTHER MEMBERS- AND I KNOW THE DOCTOR QUIRKIER ON THE LINE I RECOGNIZE THAT YOU. PUT YOUR- IMAGINARY HAND UP- SO WE'LL- WILL RECOGNIZE YOU AND THEN WE'LL MOVE TO MEMBERS HERE IN THE IN THE CHAMBER- BUT LET ME ASK- BECAUSE ABOUT YOU AND YOUR TEAM- WHAT CAN BE DONE IN THE MIDDLE OF FIRE SEASON. WHEN PS PS EVENTS ARE ONGOING AND WE SEE THAT A UTILITY IS FAILING TO MEET CUSTOMER AND PUBLIC SAFETY NEEDS DURING P. S. P. S. OF A- SURE HOLDEN THANK YOU- I WOULD SAY WE DOUBLE DOWN- WE% DOUBLE DOWN IN TERMS OF OUR OVERSIGHT OF THE UTILITY- AND HOW WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE THAT WE- HAVE SOME OF OUR- ENFORCEMENT AND- MITIGATION EMPLOYEES THEY'RE AT IN THEIR CENTERS. IN THEIR MARGINS ARE FOR EXAMPLE- WE HAVE DONE THAT IN THE PAST WHERE WE HAVE- BEEN- INVOLVED AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT IN THEIR EMERGENCY CENTERS I THINK WE WOULD- ENGAGE IN THEM- NOT I THINK WE WOULD. ENGAGE WITH THEM AT EVERY LEVEL OF THE IPO YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY AREN'T HEARING ONE TO THE PS PS GUIDELINES. THAT THE P. YOU SEE HAS PASSED AND- INSURING THAT THEIR- DEFINITELY- BEING AT IT HERE TOO I WOULD ALSO AS I HAVE IN THE PAST I WILL WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH MARK GHILARDUCCI AND HIS TEAM AT- YES. A CALLAWAY YES TO BE SURE THAT WE ARE ALL GETTING THE KIND OF INFORMATION WE NEED TO FOR EXAMPLE DURING THE TWENTY TWENTY FIRE SEASON- DIRECTOR GHILARDUCCI. AND I SHARED INFORMATION THAT- WE WERE GETTING THE KIND OF REPORTING- SORRY EDISON SPECIFICALLY FROM MEDICINE THAT WE NEEDED TO AND WE DID A CORRECTIVE ACTION IF YOU WILL RIGHT THEN AND THERE- WE HAVE- I'VE CALLED MEETINGS AS WE NOTED TODAY IT'S BEEN NOTED ELSEWHERE- TO- QUESTION THEM AND FOLLOW UP KIND OF MEMOS AND- ENQUIRIES NOT ONLY ACTION PLANS. BUT ALSO PARTICULARLY IN THE MEDICAL BASELINE BATTERY- PROGRAMS WHERE I WOULD SAY THEY'RE ALL IMPROVING BUT THEIR WOEFULLY BEHIND AND THIS IS OF GREAT CONCERN TO THE PC AND- I MUST SAY THAT ALMOST EVERY PUBLIC COMMENT WE HAVE. WE HAVE WELL WE HAVE A P. C. MEETINGS- CUSTOMERS TESTIFIED TO THE FACT THAT THEY DESPERATELY NEED A BACKUP BATTERY SO- IT'S WE HAVE SEVERAL TOOLS AT OUR OUR- IN OUR TOOL KIT IF YOU WILL THAT WE CAN ENGAGE IN REAL TIME DURING THE FIRE SEASON. AND BOTH WITH OUR EMPLOYEES. BEING INVENTED IN IN. THE EMERGENCY-OPERATIONS OF- THE I. O. USED AS WELL AS IF YOU WILL THE POWER OF THE REGULATOR. AND WE WILL WE WILL USE THAT I HAVE USED IT AND I WILL CONTINUE TO BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IS GETTING AHEAD OF IT BEFOREHAND. AND AS AS I DISCUSSED AND- MY COLLEAGUES DISCUSSED WE'RE DOING THAT IN CASES WHERE WE THINK THERE'S SOME REMEDIAL WORK NEEDING TO BE DONE NOW TO PREPARE FOR- TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE'RE ENGAGING WITH EDISON- YOU KNOW AND ABIDE BY- BY MONTHLY EFFORT AND WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT THE ACTION PLAN THAT THEY SUBMITTED. TO THE COMMISSION IN FEBRUARY AS WELL AS A FOLLOW UP MEETING WE HAD YESTERDAY THEY ARE DEEDED HEARING TO THE ACTUAL LAN SO AS I'VE SAID MANY TIMES I SAID TODAY MY TESTIMONY. OUTCOMES THEY WILL BE JUDGED BY THEIR OUTCOMES NOT BY THEIR PLANS- GONNA DO TRYING TO DO WILL DO SORT OF PLANNING. THAT'S WHAT WE ARE IN THE PRIOR SEASON IS WE'VE ALL DISCUSSED IS SHORTER IS LONGER AND WILL BECOME. COME UPON US SOONER IT WILL LAST LONGER AS WE WITNESSED IN. AND WILL BE SOME MORE SEVERE SO THAT PLANNING MUST BE DONE NOW SO WE DON'T HAVE TO DO CORRECTIVE ACTIONS IN THE MIDST OF. LITERALLY THE FIRESTORM. I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION SHAREHOLDER. APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWER THANK YOU PRESIDENT VENTURE- WE'RE GOING TO TURN TO DR QUIRKY HAS A QUESTION THEN. MISS RAYOS. AND MISTER MASON THAT ORDER. THANK YOU CHAIR. SO THIS IS A QUESTION FOR THE UTILITY. TALK ABOUT TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS- DISCONNECTING THE FLOW OF ELECTRONS THROUGH THE WINDS. MORE WHEN THESE MEN WILL BERATE. THAT ANOTHER CHECK NOW HELLO WILL IT TAKE TO DEVELOP. FOR THEM AND WHAT SORT OF TECHNOLOGIES ALL YOU SEE IS WHAT SORT OF A TIME FRAME. IN NO. WHICH YOU TELL WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE BIRDS. HI THIS IS A JOHN JENKINS FROM SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC ALL ALL OF ALL STEP IN PERSON- WE ARE APPOINTED I BELIEVE YOUR PRINTER POLLING CONDUCTED KNOWLEDGE EACH WERE AT THE BILL THE ONE BREAKS IT WE CAN SENSE THAT ENERGIZED FOR HIS THE GROUND- WE DEPLOYED THAT ON I BELIEVE EIGHT TO TEN CIRCUIT TO. GET THE EXACT NUMBER SOMEWHERE IN THAT RANGE THOUGH AND- THE- IMPEDIMENT TO GOING FASTER IS THE POINT OUR PRIVATE LTE NETWORKS YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CERTAIN. COMMUNICATION SPEED BETWEEN DEVICES OBVIOUSLY IN ORDER FOR THAT TO HAPPEN- WE PURCHASED THE BROADBAND SPECTRUM FOR PRIVATE LTE NETWORK LAST YEAR- WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF INSTALLING THE COMMUTER STATIONS THE THAT'LL COST TO DO THAT- BUT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE. FULLY FUNCTIONAL BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND WE'VE BEEN INSTALLING THE DEVICES THAT GO ALONG WITH THAT TO TALK TO IT- WITH HER BY HER NEED EFFORT SO IT'S. BEING DONE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THAT. THE AMAZING COMPETING I CAN GO NEXT THANK SO MUCH FOR QUESTION- IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER FALLING CONDUCTOR KNOWLEDGE SAID THANK YOU BROKE OFF. WHICH I REFERENCED PREVIOUSLY THE RAPTORS FONG AND THEIR TAKE ALL. THANK IT THAT THAT HAS. AROUND SINCE TO. INSTEAD OF VICTORIA IN AUSTRALIA- ACTUALLY WHERE- WE GOT INSIGHTS ON THE FOURTH OF THE DAY THAT WOULD BE THE BENCHMARKING BACK IN MIDDLE ONE NINETEEN- SO I MENTIONED WE'VE FIVE SOLD ON WATER CIRCUIT STOP ACTING. ROUGHLY HUNDRED FIFTY PLUS MILES HI AND. WE'RE REALLY- EVALUATING. ALL COSTS. OF UNDERMINED OF THAT ON OUR- MORNING THAT PROCESS AND THAT'S PART OF. ALSO LEARN. A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT IN TERMS OF THE NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES ALL YOU HAVE TO MAKE. AND WE LOOK AT THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN DEVELOPED WHO WITHIN OUR OVERALL SYSTEM HARDENING. IT'S NOT HAD A SKI- BUT BUT IT DOES GO AFTER ONE OF THE PRIMARY TYPES OF FALLS THAT COULD RESULT IN A POTENTIALLY MISSION- WHICH IS BASED GROUND BALL- NOW WITH OTHER AREA THAT DAY DOES NOT REALLY AFFECT ME THEY GAVE YAK WHOSE. OUT YOU SEE TWO LINES ARE SLAPPING TOGETHER OR SOMETHING CALLED A BASED BASEBALL. OUT WAR WHEN YOU HAVE A TREE BRANCH THAT MAYBE LAYING ON TOP OF THE TWO FACES OF THE LINE SOMETHING CALLED A HIGH IMPEDANCE FALL. ALSO WE LOOK AT THIS AS ANOTHER TOOL IN OUR TOOL KIT FIVE THIS COUPLED WITH AUSTIN PARDONING PROGRAM OF COVERED DOCTOR CAN DRAMATICALLY REDUCE. RISK PROFILE NOW WE'VE GOT A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF MILES WITH IPHONES BUT DISTRIBUTION FROM FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SO WE'RE LOOKING AT YOU KNOW. FIVE YEARS PLUS ON ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY- TECHNOLOGY THAT- WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IS- SOMETHING CALLED THE DISTRIBUTION TRANSMISSION SUBSTATION FIRE ACTION SCHEME. ALREADY USING A SERIES OF CAMERAS AND SENSORS ARE MOUNTED ON OUR EQUIPMENT TO QUICKLY DETECT OBJECTS THAT ARE APPROACHING. ENERGIZED POWER LINES AND WE CAN DO THE SHOPPING FOR THE AUTO OBJECT ACTUALLY ENDS UP IMPACTING. THE OVERHEAD LINE INCLUDING A POTENTIAL SPARKED ACTION BY THE PATENT HOLDERS- DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR. YEAH WE DON'T HAVE ANOTHER WAY TO GOT A WHOLE LOT TRANSMISSION LINE. OF SEVENTY MILES THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE- THE POINT IS OPERATIONALLY- FOR THIS YEAR AND THAT AS WE ARE. OKAY THE SUCCESSFUL WE ANTICIPATE I THINK WE CANNOT QUICKLY ASKING A LOT THAT IMPLEMENTATION GOING. TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE. MARTIN'S BURKE. YEAH USE OUR PUBLIC. YES YES OUR- WHILE DOZENS LIKE IT THE END OF THE NAY MORE THANK BOB CHECKING. THAT YOU PEOPLE THAT. ON THE WAYS IN WHICH- MARCH TWENTY MORMON WE WILL BE WITH MY TECHNOLOGY. SO PERHAPS I CAN JUMP AND I THINK THAT RIGHT WE- PILINGS MAYBE I CAN OUT THE COMMITTEE ALSO IS- ACTIVELY CALL. WITH A SENIOR MY P. THAT'S OF OUR- WE ACTUALLY BEEN DOING THAT FOR YEARS NOW- ALONG WITH WORK WITH THE UTILITIES ARE THE GLOBE SEARCHES ARE. WE DO WORK. A RAPPER TALK LIMITING WHICH IT DOES AN IMPORTANT TECH THIS YEAR- AND SO WE'RE MOVING FORWARD WITH- WITH THE TEST OF THAT PROGRAMS LIKE TO THREE DIFFERENT VARIETIES- WERE. I WOULD EACH ONE OF THEM. ANOTHER TECHNO YOU. FEEL A LITTLE BIT PILOT- DISTRIBUTION BALTIC DISSIPATION. SO THIS IS ACTUALLY LOOKING AT WINTERKORN'S WITHIN THE LINE AND IDENTIFYING PROBLEMS BEFORE THE BAKER. JOHN MENTIONED- DETECTING- ALL FALLING LINE THIS IS A- PRE FILING LINE IF YOU WILL- YOU IDENTIFY THINGS LIKE. YOUR MICRO. PATTERNS IN THE IN THE- SINGLES COMING YOUR CIRCUITS. AND CAN GO OUT AND INVESTIGATE AND WE'VE ACTUALLY FOUND EVIDENCE OF. LINES ALLOW. HAVING OCCURRED THAT WE WOULD NEVER SEE IT DOESN'T RISE TO FAULT IT DOESN'T RISE TO BOOK- SPARKING YET- PUT IT IN THE NEXT. TO DO THAT WE- WERE TARGETING AROUND A HUNDRED THIS YEAR WE'VE GOT IN ON SIXTY CIRCUITS AND BY THE WAY WE HAVE AROUND ELEVEN HUNDRED CIRCUITS. DISTRIBUTION IN OUR CHOIR SIX NOT INSIGNIFICANT. THE OTHER IS EARLY FALL DETECTION REPAIR WELL WHICH IS TO BE FAULTED DISSIPATION THIS ACTUALLY USES RADIO WAVES. AND SENSES OTHER TYPES OF FAULTS BUT HE GIVES YOU A BETTER IDEA OF WHERE CALL MAYBE. I THINK FOR US AND AS IT RELATES TO PS PS AND OVERALL MITIGATIONS- D. B. CONCEPT IS. IS MANY OVERLAPPING TOOLS TO PROTECT AND MINIMIZE THE THREAT OF A FIRE. IS THE PATH TO ELIMINATING PS PS IT PROBABLY. I'M LIKELY TO BE ANY ONE OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES- AND BY THE WAY MACHINE LEARNING AND ALL THAT IS BEING APPLIED TO. ALL THE SIGNATURES WERE GETTING FROM- THESE NEW INSTRUMENTS AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES OUT WHICH WILL HELP US BE. REALLY ABLE TO PROTECT WORKERS A KIRK- HAVE YOU HAVE IT OKAY FOR US IN BOTH THE NORMAL HEART MEDICATION PLAN. AND OVERALL GREAT PLAN IN THE YEARS TO COME. BUT IT'S WILL BE YEAR ON YEAR WE'RE GONNA NEED TO MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS- THEY'RE- PROBABLY. PROBABLY WE DON'T SEE A SILVER BULLET. HE HAD TO ELIMINATE THE SPLC'S WANNABE ARTWORK. LOTS OF IT AND ANY COUPLE. AN OVERLAP TECHNO WILL GET THERE. GIVEN ALL THE TECHNOLOGY WALLS WELL. I'M AS THE OF YES YES STATE ALL. YES I'M GONNA GO. CONCERT I'M SORRY I DIDN'T HEAR IT- THE- WITH ALL THE CHECK THAT NEED TO BE DEVELOPED AND- I WOULD THAT. YES YES IT NEEDS TO ALL. IT IT WILL BE SO I TAKE YOUR A YEAR BUT I DO THINK YOU'RE ON YOUR WRIST SIGNIFICANT- AS WE- CONTINUE A LIMITED SOURCES OF NATION'S AND EVERYTHING OUR ADD- IS YOU KNOW IN THE THEY- DEVELOPMENT OUT OF CLAY IT'S WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON. YES YES SO I REALLY WANT TO ON THE I THINK WILL SEE. PROGRESS TOWARDS REDUCTIONS IN P. S. B. S. OVER THE EARLY YEARS AND SO I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED AND- AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN AS EFFICIENTLY AS WE CAN REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF P. S. B. S. THAT WE THINK WE NEED TO- TO PERFORM. IT'S VERY HARD TO GET LOANS YEAH. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK GOD THAT'S- PRESERVER MISTER BASS. STIR CHAIR- I'M GLAD WE'RE HERE- GLAD THAT WE PUT THIS TOGETHER YOU KNOW AS- ONE OF THE ROLES THAT WE HAVE AS MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE IS NOT IN COMMITTEE IS OVERSIGHT AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO DO JUST THAT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT HELLO THE ONE THING I'M ALWAYS. A BIT CONCERNED ABOUT IS OF THE WAY AS POLITICIANS THAT WE SOMETIMES BEHAVE- BECAUSE- AS POLITICIANS WE REFLECTED WE REACT TO OUR CONSTITUENCIES AND I KNOW WITH THESE P. S. P. S. EVENTS WE HAD A LOT OF FOLKS IN OUR RESPECTIVE DISTRICTS THAT WERE WERE UPSET OR ANGRY AND SO AS THEIR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES WE COME HERE- WANTING TO SHOW US SOME OF THAT ANGER AND BE ABLE TO TELL PEOPLE WHO'S BOSS. THE ONE THING OF COURSE- THAT COMES WITH TIME BEING HERE IN THIS- THIS BODY AND EXPERIENCES AND THAT WE HAVE A WITHIN THIS BODY IS UNDERSTANDING HOW WE GOT TO THIS VERY PLACE- I WOULD JUST THE OTHER EVENING I WAS EXPLAINING TO ONE OF THE NEW MEMBERS THIS YEAR THAT WHY WE HAVE PS PS IN THE FIRST PLACE AND WE HAVE P. S. P. S. BECAUSE THIS LEGISLATURE TOLD- THE- THE I'LL USE TO- TO HAVE PS PS BECAUSE WE AS A LEGISLATURE COULD NOT GET TO A PLACE. WHERE WE COULD AMEND ARTICLE ONE SECTION NINETEEN OF THE STATE CONSTITUTION THAT PROVIDES FOR- AND THAT DOMAIN THE PAYMENT AND DAMAGES AND OF COURSE ALL THAT GOES WITH WE TALK ABOUT THE DOCTOR OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION THAT'S WHY WE ARE HERE BECAUSE OF THE LIABILITY OF THESE FIRES WERE SO INCREDIBLE AND THE COST WE'RE GOING TO BE SO GREAT AND I KNOW THAT THAT THE CHAIR AND I SERVED- ON THE SB NINE A ONE. A ARE THE CONFERENCE- WE ALSO- ENDED UP COMING UP WITH THE ENORMOUS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. BUT IT SURE WAS THE- I WAS THE LEAD AUTHOR ON ON AB TEN FIFTY FOUR TO COME UP WITH A WILDFIRE FUND THAT HAS. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF CLAIMS PAYING CAPACITY WHY BECAUSE THESE FIRES THE COST OF THEM ARE GREAT AND WE AS A LEGISLATURE COULD NEVER GET TO THE FACT THAT WE COULD. AMEND OR FIX THAT SECTION OF THE STATE CONSTITUTION WE UNDERSTAND THERE'S LIABILITY THAT'S THERE. MY QUESTION IS THAT'S THE STATEMENT THAT I WANT TO MAKE IT A QUESTION THAT IWAS GOING TO HAVE IS THE ONE THAT. A DOCTOR CORK- ENDED UP ASKING AND THAT IS. THAT THE GOAL NEEDS TO BE TO BE ABLE TO LIMIT THESE P. S. P. S. ADVANCE AS MUCH AS WE POSSIBLY CAN TO APPROVE. ON UP ON THE SYSTEM AND WHEN THERE'S TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE. OF IT ARE WE AT THE PLACE- TO BE ABLE TO GET TO WHERE WE DON'T HAVE TO DE ENERGIZE AND I THINK. THE ANSWER WAS THERE AT LEAST BYE BYE BYE ONE OF ONE OF THE FOLKS SAYING THAT WITHIN THE NEXT. TEN YEARS MAYBE WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE THEM BUT THE GOAL NEEDS TO BE TO TRY TO LIMIT THEM. BUT WE NEED TO BE WORKING TOGETHER WITH OUR PARTNERS AT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A SYSTEM. THAT WORKS AND WE JUST HAVE TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS AND VERY CAREFUL. THAT WE DON'T START BRINGING UP A LOT OF THIS A NEGATIVE RHETORIC TO GET PEOPLE ALL FIRED UP. ONCE AGAIN WE'VE DONE AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF WORK IN. THIS SPACE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU POINT. WEL TAKEN BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT. THERE'S CERTAIN DEFICIENCIES AND EX AND IMPLEMENTING. THE GUIDELINES IN OR YOU CAN SAY HERE'S WHAT WE EXPECT YOU TO DO AND IT'S LIKE OKAY WE'RE GOING TO DO IT AND THEN IT DOESN'T GET DONE. I THINK EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS DE ENERGIZING LINES TECHNOLOGY IT ALL GOES HAND IN HAND. THE UNDERGROUND IN THE LINES FOR WINDOW VENTS IS ALSO ANOTHER DETERRENT SO THERE'S A LOT OF THERE'S A MENU. OF THINGS THAT WERE OUTLINED IN NINE OH ONE. AND WHAT'S EXPECTED IN THESE MITIGATION PLANS AND THE P. U. C. HAS THEIR RESPONSIBILITY. TO ENSURE THAT THOSE PLANS ARE BEING MONITORED AND IT HERE TO AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING.IS THAT NOT THE SAME KIND OF EFFORT. YOU KNOW THERE THERE'S AN EXPECTATION THAT NOT WITHSTANDING. THE CHALLENGES THAT THIS COMES WITH- THAT. YOU STILL HAVE TO STEP UP. AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE OF THIS OVERSIGHT IS TO SORT OF. NO PUN INTENDED KEEP THE FIRE LIT- RECORD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND THANK YOU FOR THIS INFORMATIVE HEARING I WANT TO START BY SAYING THAT WILDFIRE IS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT MY CONSTITUENTS WORRY ABOUT MOST IS WHAT KEEPS THEM UP AT NIGHT I REPRESENT COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ON THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY AND THEY'RE AFRAID THEY'RE AFRAID OF UTILITY BECAUSE WILDFIRES. AND THEN IN TWENTY NINETEEN WHO WE WERE DEVASTATED BY THE PS PS EVENTS THAT WERE SO POORLY MANAGED WE WERE OUT FOR ALMOST A WEEK IN SOME INSTANCES WITH LITTLE TO NO COMMUNICATION HOSPITALS WERE TOLD THEY WOULDN'T BE TURNED UP DE ENERGIZED AND THEY WERE DE ENERGIZED WITH NO NOTICE- I THINK THAT I REALLY WANT TO THANK THE DIRECTORS AND PRESIDENT BADGER FOR HIGHLIGHTING. THE DANGER OF THESE EVENTS I THINK THAT IS WHAT GOES UNMENTIONED SO FREQUENTLY WE TALK ABOUT THE NEED TO HAVE THESE EVENTS IN ORDER TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITY BUT WE LOSE LIVES WHEN WE HAVE THESE EVENTS AS WELL NUMBERS OF SENIORS FELL DURING THE DAYS ON AND P. S. P. S. EVENTS THAT LED TO THEIR DEATHS. AND I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE MENTIONED BECAUSE THESE ARE NOT INCIDENTS THAT ARE WITHOUT HORRIBLE OUTCOMES AND SO WE NEED TO BE AS CAREFUL AS WE CAN AND HOW WE USE THEM HOW LONG THEY LAST AND HOW THEY'RE IMPLEMENTED. I DO ALSO WANT TO CREDIT PRESIDENT BADGER THE DIRECTORS AND PG&amp;E FOR A VAST IMPROVEMENT YEAR OVER YEAR BETWEEN TWENTY NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY AS REFLECTED IN THE NUMBERS THAT WERE PRESENTED TODAY WE SAW INCREDIBLE DECREASE IN THE IMPACT OF PS PS THIS YEAR I HEARD FROM NONE OF MY HOSPITALS THIS YEAR THAT THEY WERE DE ENERGIZED WITH NO NOTICE SO THAT WAS GREAT NEWS FOR ME- AND- YOU KNOW. IT WAS DONE IN A WAY THAT WAS BETTER WE HAVE A LOT OF WAYS TO GO BUT I DO WANT TO CREDIT THE VAST IMPROVEMENT IN JUST A. SINGLE YEAR TO THE IMPACT OF THESE EVENTS. I'M MIKE QUESTION FOR. DIRECTOR THOMAS JACOBS IS THAT YOU MENTIONED THAT IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY ONE REPORTS THAT WAS. PUT FORWARD JUST RECENTLY PG&amp;E SAID THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE PROJECTIONS WERE FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE FOR THE PS PS EVENTS OR THEY WERE. UNDETERMINED CAN YOU SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT IS THAT AGAIN WE EXPECT CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT AND I WOULD EXPECT TO PROJECTION TO SHOW THAT. BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT IS AND WHAT WAS IN THE REPORT. SURE I CAN BE THAT SO THE REPORT THAT WE REQUIRE THEM TO SUBMIT PROJECTIONS FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PERFORMANCE METRICS- PG&amp;E DID SUPPLY SOME OF THOSE. SOME OF THEM THEY SAID THEY COULD NOT SUPPLY YET BECAUSE THERE IS GOOD CURRENT- A PROPOSED CONDITIONS THROUGH THE FEDERAL COURT. THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY IMPACT THE NUMBER OF PS PS EVENTS AND THE SCOPE OF THOSE EVENTS. BASED ON THE OUTCOME OF THAT SO THEY DID NOT INCLUDE THAT PRODUCTION AND THEN WHEN THAT IS SETTLED THEY WILL THEY HAVE COMMITTED ALREADY TO ME THEY WILL SUBMIT THAN THEIR PROJECTIONS ONCE THEY HAVE THAT. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR ENSURING THAT WE WILL GET THOSE PROJECTIONS BECAUSE I THINK I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR POINT ABOUT BEING ABLE TO WATCH. YOUR OVER YOUR THE IMPROVEMENT BUT WE CAN ONLY DO THAT IF WE HAVE LAST YEAR'S DATA PROJECTIONS AND HOW THEY PERFORM AGAINST THOSE PROJECTIONS. AND I ALSO HAD A QUESTION SIMILAR TO WHAT DOCTOR FORECAST ABOUT HOW- I APPRECIATE THE GOAL BEING. GETTING TO A PLACE WHERE WE NO LONGER NEED THESE PSCS EVENTS AND THAT PEOPLE. THAT WE ARE A LOT WE ARE ABLE TO RELIABLY AND SAFELY PROVIDE ENERGY TO OUR COMMUNITIES WHICH SHOULD BE THE EXPECTATION THAT I THINK ALL OF US SHOULD HAVE FOR I'LL USE- AND I APPRECIATE THE ANSWERS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY MY QUESTION FOR- THE FOLKS AT THE P. YOU SEE WHOEVER WANTS TO ANSWER THIS AND ALSO. THE I USE IF THEY SO DESIRE IS. HOW ARE WE SORT OF IN ANSWERING DOCTOR HER QUESTION THERE WAS A LOT OF TECHNOLOGY TO SCOTT IF THEY'RE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES OBVIOUSLY HARDENING THE GRID. MAINTENANCE THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE ALWAYS TO GET TO A SAFER GRADE THAT WOULDN'T REQUIRE. AN D. ENERGIES ASIAN HOW ARE WE TRACKING THAT- I KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IMPROVEMENT BUT HOW ARE WE SORT OF SETTING A GOAL TO. KNOW. D. ENERGIES ATION AND GETTING THEIR- WELL. THANK VERY- YEAH- I AM GOING TO ADD CAROLINE TO TALK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IT FITS WELL INTO THE WELFARE MITIGATION PLANS AND- STRATEGIES AND THEN METRICS THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED TO HOLD FOLKS ACCOUNTABLE IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY AS WELL AS OTHER STRATEGIES FOR THE PS PS CAROLINE SURE SO THAT GOES TO THE HEART OF HOW WE EVALUATE THE WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLANS AND WHAT WE ESTABLISHED LAST YEAR WAS A VERY CLEAR STRUCTURE ON. THE TYPE OF CONTENT NOT WITH THE ACTUAL CONTENT IS BECAUSE THE POLICE HAVE TELL US WHAT THEIR PLAN IS BUT HOW THE STRUCTURE THAT CONTENT SO THAT WE CAN DIVE INTO THAT SO SPECIFIC TO YOUR QUESTION IS WE'VE CREATED TEN DIFFERENT CATEGORIES THAT WE- OF REQUIRED UTILITIES TO SUBMIT INFORMATION AND A LOT OF INCLUDING THE EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND WE HAVE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS TO DO ANALYSIS ON THOSE SPECIFIC AREAS. AND WE ASK THAT- REQUIRE THE UTILITIES DISSIDENT PERFORMANCE METRICS TO EACH OF THOSE AREAS AND WE LOOK AT A DIFFERENT SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF PERFORMANCE METRICS LEADING AND LAGGING INDICATORS AS WELL AS THE OUTCOME METRICS AND THEN THE UTILITIES ALSO OFTEN INCLUDE THEIR PROGRAM TARGETS FOR EXAMPLE HOW MANY SEXUALIZING DEVICES ARE GOING TO SIT- I DO THIS YEAR OR HOW MANY TREES ARE GONNA EXPECT THAT TYPE OF THING. ARE THEN TEAM LOOKS AT ALL OF THAT AND WE PUT PUSH IN ON EACH OF THOSE IN OUR ANALYSIS AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT WE'RE NOT DECIDING WHICH TOOLS THEY'RE GOING TO USE TO TRY AND REDUCE THE RISK. EACH UTILITY HAS DIFFERENT TOPOGRAPHY HAVE DIFFERENT CUSTOMER BASE DIFFERENT GREAT DESIGN THAT FOR THEIR JOB WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE PROBING ON THE QUESTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE THINKING THROUGH THAT AND SPECIFICALLY ON THE EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES WE ALSO OFTEN ASK IS THAT YOU UTILITIES A REFERENCE ALREADY ALREADY COORDINATING WITH EACH OTHER SO THAT THEY'RE LEARNING FROM EACH OTHER. ON THE DIFFERENT PILOTS THEY'RE DOING AND THEN LEVERAGING WHERE IT'S APPROPRIATE ON THEIR BREAD THE- THOSE LEARNINGS AND NOT EVERY. SINGLE DAY A PILOT CAN BE PICKED UP AND DROPPED INTO ELSE'S TERRITORY. BUT WE MAKING SURE THAT THE CONGRESS ARE. BECAUSE WE WANT TO LEVERAGE. THE EXTENT. OF GETTING IN FOR OUT THERE SO THEY DON'T ALL HAVE TO REPEAT THE SAME THAILAND. THEY DON'T ALL HAVE TO THINK THROUGH THESE THINGS INDIVIDUALLY BECAUSE TO THE POINT- THAT WAS EARLIER BROUGHT UP BY THE COMMITTEE. NUMBER WE WANT THIS TO HAPPEN IN A VERY EFFICIENT AND FAST WAY TO BE ABLE TO REDUCE THE NEED FOR PS PS. THANK YOU ARE THERE SPECIFIC I KNOW LAST YEAR I THINK WE HAD MET AND YOU HAD SAID THAT YOU WERE TRYING TO REDUCE B. S. B. S. EVENTS BY THIRTY PERCENT. FROM TWENTY- NINETEEN ARE THERE SPECIFIC METRICS THAT THE AYE USER TRYING TO MEET YOUR EVERY YEAR. SO 30% WAS ACTUALLY TEACHING HE'S AFTER OKAY YOU DON'T SET THAT GOAL. BUT WE ASK THEM TO SET THEIR GOALS BASED ON HOW THEY'RE APPLYING THEIR MITIGATION STRATEGIES. AND THEY TELL US WHAT THEIR GOAL IS AND THEN WE POTENTIALLY PUSH ON THAT GOAL. BUT THEY'RE THE ONES THAT PROPOSALS. I THINK YOU'RE PROCEEDING FROM. THANK YOU I SEE NO OTHER MEMBERS HERE ON THE COMMITTEE. IN THE CHAMBER WHO ARE SEEKING. A RECOGNITION FOR ASKING A QUESTION IS THERE ANYONE. ON THE LINE. SAM NUNN- THEN AS WE MOVE TO A PUBLIC COMMENT- I'D LIKE TO. RECOGNIZE THAT THAT'S WHERE WE ARE ON THE AGENDA AT THIS MOMENT AND I'M- ONE OF THE STATE THAT WILL MAINTAIN- DECORUM DURING THE HEARING. AS IS CUSTOMARY IN AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS DISRUPTIVE MAY BE REMOVED FROM THE CHAMBER OR- REMOTE MEETING SERVICE OR HAVING THEIR CONNECTIONS MUTED. DO WE HAVE- LET'S SEE. DO WE HAVE ANYONE WHOWOULD LIKE TO COMMA OF IN FROM THE BACK OF THE GALLERY. THERE'S ONE PERSON. I AM SO PLEASED TO STATE YOUR NAME AND YOUR ORGANIZATION. MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST BURNING A ROSTER WITH THE CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SOME BRIEF COMMENTS- FIRST OF ALL THE CABLE INDUSTRY WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMISSION AND THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES- IN THEIR EFFORTS TO. ENSURE THAT- IN DEVELOPING THESE GUIDELINES FOR PS PS IS THERE'S THERE IS NO COMPROMISE OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY STANDARDS OR GOALS SO WE ARE APPRECIATIVE THAT- MR HOLDEN ARCHER HOLDEN I WANT TO. TOUCH ON SOMETHING YOU SAID EVERYONE WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY AS A ROLE HERE AND- RECENTLY A COUPLE WEEKS AGO THE COMMISSION JUST RECENTLY ADOPTED- NEW REQUIREMENTS FOR COMMUNICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS OF SEVEN TWO HOURS OF BACKUP POWER. AND THAT'S GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE FOR US- THAT'S WE HAVE OVER FIFTY THOUSAND NOTES IN CALIFORNIA EACH OF THOSE NOTES IS GOING TO REQUIRE A BACKUP GENERATORS SELL WHEAT IN THEIR HAVE CELLS WE HAVE BATTERIES NOW THAT PROVIDES YOU KNOW ROUGHLY- TWELVE FIFTEEN HOURS OF BACKUP POWER BUT SEVEN TWO HOURS IS A CHALLENGE. SO THAT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT IS A LOT OF MONEY AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO DOING THAT- THE COMMISSION DD PROVIDE FOR A WAIVER PROCESS IN THE EVENT THAT WE SHOULD HAVE. SOME CHALLENGES IN GETTING THOSE LOCAL GOVERNMENT PERMITS SO IN YOUR COMMENT ABOUT EVERYONE HAS A ROLE HERE I MEAN WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BETTER PARTNER WITH COMMUNICATION SERVER SERVICE PROVIDERS IN GETTING THOSE PERMITS- THE- PERMIT PROCESS AT THE COMMISSION HAS. IS VERY CHALLENGING IT'S A EIGHT MONTH WINDOW PERIOD THAT WE HAVE TO GET THOSE BATTERIES IN PLACE FOR THIS BACKUP POWER OR WHATEVER WE NEED SO WE'RE HOPING THAT- THERE CAN BE A BETTER PARTNERSHIP ON THAT AND THAT- AS YOU CONTINUE TO MONITOR HOW THESE PS PIECE EVENTS ARE. ROLLED OUT THAT WE COME BACK AND REVISIT THIS OF PERMITTING PROCESS FOR BACKUP POWERS THANK YOU THANK YOU APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND WE'LL TAKE NOTE OF THOSE COMMENTS ON THE INTO. THE ISSUE AS YOU OUTLINED IT AND SEE IF WE CAN GET SOME KIND OF SENSE OF NEXT DIRECTION ON THAT I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. HI IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE GALLERY NO ONE ELSE IN THE GALLERY- THEN WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS- MOVE WE WILL NOW MOVE TO THE WITNESSES WAITING TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT VIA TELECONFERENCE SERVICE IS THERE ANYONE. THERE TO PEOPLE THAT ARE- WAITING TO SPEAK. MODERATOR IF YOU WOULD PLEASE PROMPT INDIVIDUALS WAITING TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT. SO WE WILL BEGIN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT THE PRESS ONE ZERO AND OUR FIRST PUBLIC COMMENT COMES FROM THE LINE TWENTY TWO. HI LINE TWENTY TWO AND MY AND COMMITTEES. YES YOU ARE. MY NAME IS ANDREA HAS FROM AND I'M CALLING IN TODAY OF THE DISPLACED PERSON FROM THE TUBBS FIRE I AS A MEMBER OF A FAMILY OF SIX PEOPLE INCLUDING FOUR YOUNG CHILDREN WAS LIVING IN SANTA ROSA IN OCTOBER OF SEVENTEEN WHEN THE TUBBS FIRE DESTROYED FIFTY THREE HUNDRED HOMES AND LARGELY GOTTEN STATED CINEMA COUNTY IN GENERAL A DISASTER FROM WHICH THIS REGION HAVE LARGELY NOT RECOVERED. SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT THIS TOPIC IS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE AND INTERESTS TO ME WITH THE SUCTION AND IMPORTANT AND SIGNIFICANT ISSUE THAT I HAVE SPOKEN IN PERSON IN MULTIPLE HEARING THERE IN THE CAPITAL ABOUT FIVE YEARS UTILITIES AND RELATED TOPICS. HOW MY YOUNG CHILDREN SO I'D LIKE TO PROVIDE SOME INFORMATION ACCORDING TO A JULY TENTH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN ARTICLE BY BRANDON REGIMEN WITH ABC TEN EIGHT OUT OF TEN MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE ACCEPTED CORPORATE FILING PG&amp;E AND THIS WAS AFTER PG&amp;E DONATED MILLION TO CALIFORNIA POLITICIAN AFTER IT WAS CONVICTED OF SIX FEDERAL FELONIES CONNECTED CONNECTED TO THE TWO THOUSAND TEN SEVERAL PIPELINE EXPLOSION THAT KILLED EIGHT PEOPLE SIMILARLY ACCORDING TO A WASHINGTON POST ARTICLE FROM NOVEMBER ELEVEN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. NEWSOME ACCUSE PG&amp;E OF CORPORATE GREED BUT OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES ACCEPTED OVER SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN DONATIONS FROM A CONVICTED FELON POWER MONOPOLY PG&amp;E TO FIND HIS POLITICAL CAREER AND HIS WIFE MOVIE COMPANY EXCUSE ME ABOUT IT IS THAT A CONCERN. I DON'T ME I DON'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT YOU BUT THIS IS IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION THAT YOU'RE. GOING TO GET INTO THAN THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. AND I WOULD DENIED ACCESS TO THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE. EVEN THE LAST WEEK I ATTENDED AN ASSEMBLY SESSION IN PROGRESS THAT. IS SHOCKING TO ME THAT IS A DISPLACED PERSON FROM ONE OF THE DEADLIEST AND MOST DESTRUCTIVE FIRES. IN CALIFORNIA PEOPLE IMPROPERLY HISTORY THAT I WOULD BE DENIED ACCESS TODAY TO THE PEOPLE HOW TO OUR HOUSE. TO MY CHILD. MY QUIET YEAH AND- HEARING NOTHING. NOTHING AND THEN DIDN'T ME VERY CALL CAN- MA'AM HI. MA'AM I DO A YOU HAVING YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS- WE ARE GOING TO MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT CALLER BUT THANK YOU FOR- FOR WAITING AROUND AND BEING ABLE TO SHARE YOUR YOUR THOUGHTS WITH THE COMMITTEE- MODERATOR OUR OUR NEXT TO PUBLIC SPEAKER. OUR NEXT PUBLIC COMMENT COMES FROM THE LINE TWENTY FOUR PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JOHN KENNEDY AND WITH THE WORLD COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT THIRTY SEVEN WORLD COUNTIES AND THEY BORN THE BRUNT OF RECENT WILDFIRES IN PF YET THE BAND. ESPECIALLY MANY COMMUNITIES THEY'VE EXPERIENCED PROLONGED AND BACK TO BACK YES THAT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT WE UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THE WORLD UP HERE YES THE BENCH PLAY IN REDUCING THE RISK UTILITY CAUSED WILDFIRE CONDITIONS. HOWEVER WERE ALSO ACUTELY AWARE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY COST THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FIRST RESPONDERS AND RESIDENTS ESPECIALLY AT TIMES WHEN WILDFIRES IS ALREADY HIGH BRITISH SPEAKING STRONGLY ADVOCATE FOR REDUCING THE SIZE SCOPE FREQUENCY AND DURATION OF FUTURE P. S. P. S. ANAND SAYS YOU GUYS HAVE. TALKED ABOUT TODAY IT'S FRUSTRATING TO KNOW THAT IN CALIFORNIA HOME TO SILICON VALLEY AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS CONTINUES FOR THE STAR POWER IN PS PS ADAMS. ASSEMBLY PROBLEM WHEN THOSE POWER OUTAGES RESULTING MARC COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE IN THE ABILITY OF FIRST RSPONDERS TO RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES IN FOR THOSE REASONS WE DID STRONGLY SUPPORT RECENT CPUC COMMUNICATIONS RESILIENCY STANDARDS TO MAINTAIN ACCESS TO COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS DURING A POWER OUTAGE. WITH KNOWLEDGE UTILITIES HAVE UNDERTAKEN SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS IMPACTED MITIGATE IMPACTS CRITICAL FACILITIES AND IMPROVE INTERACTIONS WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AT THE SAME TIME MUCH WORK REMAINS TO BE DONE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE CPUC AND THE LEGISLATURE TO REFINE. THE PFAS GUIDELINES AND REDUCE THE SIZE SCOPE FREQUENCY AND DURATION OF OFFENSE AND MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF THAT IMPACT BOTH THE BANDS FOR CRITICAL FACILITIES INSTANCE THE POPULATIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS TODAY. THANK YOU WE. APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS- MY IS THERE OTHER. PERSON OR ANYONE ELSE A IS WHERE ON LINE. WE ONE MORE COME FROM LINE TWENTY FIVE WE'VE AHEAD. SURE HOLD NUMBER THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS WE'RE BACK AND WE- OF R. G. THANK YOU AND TO YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF TODAY FOR THIS IMPORTANT CARING AND FRIENDLY ENERGY IS THE PARENT COMPANY OF GOLD ZERO WHICH MAKES THE YETI PORTABLE POWER STATION THESE ARE THEIR PORTABLE LITHIUM ION BATTERY CAPABLE OF POWERING COMMON HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES AND MEDICAL DEVICES. THEY GET THE BATTERIES HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED TO DATE NOT JUST BY THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES BUT ALSO THEY HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED BY PHONE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO HELP MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF YEAH YEAH- WONDERFUL CUSTOMERS WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE ATTORNEY I'LL USE FOR THEIR PARTNERSHIP IN THIS ON GOING EFFORT AND WE ARE AVAILABLE TO BE A RESOURCE TO YOU ALL. AND THE ONGOING DISCUSSION TO IMPROVE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AT THE STATE CONTINUES TO TACKLE OUR CLIMBED AND WILDFIRE RESILIENCY EFFORTS HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE THANK YOU THANK YOU WE DO APPRECIATE YOUR CONTRIBUTION TO THE DISCUSSION TODAY AND YOU'RE YOU'RE SHARING YOUR THOUGHTS. OCT MODERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE CHECK THE LINE ONCE AGAIN TO BE SURE WE HAVE HEARD. FROM ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. SHARE A LADY THE GENTLEMEN ONCE A IF YOU WOULD LIKE. PROVIDE PUBLIC. PLEASE PRESS ONE AND. ZERO IN MISTER CHAIR THERE ARE NO- FURTHER COMMENT AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU AS MODERATOR HAVING HEARD ALL PUBLIC TESTIMONY MEMBERS ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SEEING NONE A LET ME JUST CONCLUDE BY SAYING I WANT TO THANK THE PANELISTS FOR THEIR TESTIMONY AND PARTICIPATION TODAY- I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT. IT'S BEEN- IMPORTANT SUBJECT- TO- TO FOCUS IN ON AND CERTAINLY AS OF LAST YEAR IT WAS- INCREDIBLY- INTENSE- ISSUE- I LET ME JUST SAY I THOUGHT THAT THE UTILITIES LEARNED FROM THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN EVENTS ON WHAT NOT TO DO. THE CPUC APPEARS TO HAVE REALLY STEPPED UP ITS EFFORTS TO PROTECT CUSTOMERS BY ADOPTING EXTENSIVE PROTOCOLS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF P. S. P. S. AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. IN LIGHT OF THEIR EFFORTS HI HELD SEVERAL BILLS ON THE TOPIC IN THE COMMITTEE LAST YEAR. IT IS NOW INCUMBENT ON THIS COMMITTEE AND ESPECIALLY MISS HERE TO TAKE THE LESSONS SHARED AT TODAY'S HEARING AND TO LOOK AT THE PERFORMANCE OUTLINED. AND TO SEE WHERE WE GO FROM HERE. I LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND COOPERATION. WE'VE CONCLUDED THIS AGENDA AND AGAIN TO OUR PANELISTS THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION COOPERATION AND YOUR INSIGHT. HAS BEEN VERY INSTRUCTIVE- TO HELP US IN TERMS OF. FROM HERE. ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE HÃ¬NH UTILITIES AND ENERGY IS A GERMAN.
