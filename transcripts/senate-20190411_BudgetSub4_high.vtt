THE TARGETED TAX CREDIT IS

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:21.741
FUNDAMENTAL TO ENDING THE

POVERTY FOR THESE CHILDREN IT

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:24.844
ADDRESSES A CORE OBJECTIVE OF

THE LIFTING CHILDREN AND

00:02:26.112 --> 00:02:28.181

BENEFITS BUT NOT ENOUGH TO PUT

00:02:50.603 --> 00:02:52.705
THEM ABOVE THE POVERTY THRESHOLD.

00:02:52.772 --> 00:02:54.774

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:03.816
ARE IMPORTANT INVESTMENTS AND I

00:03:03.883 --> 00:03:05.885
HOPE OR IMPLEMENTED BUT REACH

00:03:05.952 --> 00:03:07.720
RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THESE

00:03:07.787 --> 00:03:09.455
INVESTMENTS SUBSTANTIALLY

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:13.059
ADDRESSED SHALLOWER POVERTY NOT

00:03:13.126 --> 00:03:13.927
DEEP POVERTY.

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:15.094
THE TARGETED TAX CREDIT IS

00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:17.030
COMPLEMENTARY TO CAL WORKS IN

00:03:17.096 --> 00:03:20.199
THE IDC -- AND IT PROVIDES BASIC

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:21.367
STABILITY THAT ALLOWS PARENTS TO

00:03:21.434 --> 00:03:23.303
TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THOSE

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:24.871
OTHER PROGRAMS IF THEY ARE IF

00:03:24.938 --> 00:03:26.172
THEY'E ELIGIBLE.

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.173
THE CREDIT WILL HELP PREVENT A

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.608
NEW GENERATION OF CHILDREN FROM

00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:29.976
GROWING UP IN POVERTY AND WILL

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:31.678
ALLEVIATE THE EXPOSURE TO THE

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:33.713
TOXIC STRESS THAT IS EXPERIENCE

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.416
WHEN FAMILIES DEEPLY LEVIN DE UM.

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:37.850
IN DEEP POVERTY.

00:03:37.917 --> 00:03:38.718
THE CREDIT WILL HELP TO

00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:39.953
STABILIZE HOUSING FOR THESE

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.521
FAMILIES THE MAIN REASON WHY SO

00:03:41.588 --> 00:03:42.422
MANY OF THE CHILDREN ARE ON THE

00:03:42.488 --> 00:03:43.957
STREET IS THAT THEIR PARENTS

00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:47.193
CAN'T AFFORD THE RENT -- AND

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.294
THAT T. C. T. C. WILL GET THAT

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:49.529
WILL HELP THEM TO PAY THE RENT

00:03:49.596 --> 00:03:50.797
GET INTO STABLE HOUSING AND

00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:52.231
ALLOW THE PARENTS TO RETURN TO

00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:53.399
THE WORKFORCE.

00:03:53.466 --> 00:03:54.334
FINALLY THIS WILL BOOST THE

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.368
ECONOMIES OF OUR LOCAL

00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:57.437
COMMUNITIES 80% OF THE FUNDS

00:03:57.503 --> 00:03:59.238
SUPPORTING THESE BASIC NEEDS ARE

00:03:59.305 --> 00:04:00.506
SPENT IN THE FAMILIES LOCAL

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:01.841
COMMUNITIES.

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:02.942
SO WE CAN.

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:04.811
ELIMINATE DEEP POVERTY FOR FOUR

00:04:04.877 --> 00:04:06.512
HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:07.547
CHILDREN BY FINDING THE TARGETED.

00:04:07.614 --> 00:04:09.515

WE CALL AS CULTURE -- CO CHAIR

00:04:13.953 --> 00:04:15.888
OF THE LIFTING CHILDREN AND

00:04:15.955 --> 00:04:20.026
FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY TASK

THANK YOU.

00:04:24.464 --> 00:04:25.732
A WORD ABOUT THE HOW THIS WOULD

00:04:25.798 --> 00:04:27.100
BE -- ADMINISTERED TO THE

00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:28.534

INCOME TAX RETURN.

00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:33.272
CLAIMING THE CREDIT WOULD

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:35.475
INVOLVE TWO SIMPLE STEPS.

00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:38.077
THE NET RESOURCES OF THE FAMILY

00:04:38.144 --> 00:04:40.413
BOTH OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.216
RESOURCES WOULD BE POUT

00:04:43.282 --> 00:04:44.817
CALCULATED.

00:04:44.884 --> 00:04:46.986
A BASED ON THE AGAIN THEY'RE

00:04:47.053 --> 00:04:48.888
BOTH PROBABLY PUBLIC AND PRIVATE

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:49.989
BENEFITS.

00:04:50.056 --> 00:04:52.358
AND THEN THOSE NET RESOURCES

00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:54.627
WOULD BE COMPARED 250% OF THE

00:04:54.694 --> 00:04:56.796
CALIFORNIA POVERTY LINE.

00:04:56.863 --> 00:04:58.197
IN THE COUNTY IN WHICH THEY

00:04:58.264 --> 00:05:00.400
RESIDE THE CAT CALIFORNIA

00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:03.202
POVERTY LINE IS A STEP FURTHER

00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:04.904
THAN WHAT THE CENSUS BUREAU

00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:06.339
PROVIDES BECAUSE IT TAKES INTO

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:09.542
ACCOUNT -- THE THE SPECIFIC COST

00:05:09.609 --> 00:05:11.210
OF HOUSING IN CHILDCARE ANOTHER

00:05:11.277 --> 00:05:12.679
COSTS IN THE SPECIFIC.

00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:14.147
COUNTY IN THE CREDIT IS SIMPLY

00:05:14.213 --> 00:05:17.183
THAN EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.218
BETWEEN THE TWO I'D LIKE TO JUST

00:05:19.285 --> 00:05:21.287
EMPHASIZE THE TWO MOST CRITICAL

00:05:21.354 --> 00:05:22.422
POINTS.

00:05:22.488 --> 00:05:24.090
ABOUT THE TARGET A CHILD TAX

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:26.526
CREDIT.

00:05:26.592 --> 00:05:28.294
THE TARGET A CHILD TAX CREDIT IS

00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:32.198
NOT IN PLACE OF CAL WORKS IN

00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:34.467
CALLOUS EXPANSION E. I. T. C. IN

00:05:34.534 --> 00:05:37.070
THE E. I. T. C. EXPANSION.

00:05:37.136 --> 00:05:38.404
BOTH OF THOSE VERY STRONGLY

00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:41.307
RECOMMENDED AS PRIORITIES -- BY

00:05:41.374 --> 00:05:43.443
THE TASK FORCE. TO THE TARGET A

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:45.411
CHILD TAX CREDIT IS NOT IN PLACE

00:05:45.478 --> 00:05:48.047
OF THOSE BUT NOR ARE THEY IN

00:05:48.114 --> 00:05:49.749
PLACE.

00:05:49.816 --> 00:05:51.451
OF THE TARGETED TODD THE CHILD

00:05:51.517 --> 00:05:54.020
TAX CREDIT THESE SERVE DIFFERENT

00:05:54.087 --> 00:05:55.354
POPULATIONS.

00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:58.491
THOSE THOSE BENEFITS VENN EITC

00:05:58.558 --> 00:06:00.326
AND CAL WORKS ARE CRUCIAL.

00:06:00.393 --> 00:06:03.463
BUT THEY GENERALLY DON'T A DRESS

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:04.831
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN DEEP

00:06:04.897 --> 00:06:07.400
POVERTY IN THE STATE AND THE

00:06:07.467 --> 00:06:09.769
SENATOR IS INDICATED -- THE

00:06:09.836 --> 00:06:12.271
NUMBERS JUST REPRESENTED ED IN

00:06:12.338 --> 00:06:14.073
EACH OF YOUR DISTRICTS WHICH IS

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.410
ABOUT SIXTY SIX THOUSAND

00:06:17.477 --> 00:06:19.712
CHILDREN -- FOUR HUNDRED AND

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:20.813
FIFTY THOUSAND CHILDREN IN

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.249
CALIFORNIA ABOUT TWO HUNDRED

00:06:23.316 --> 00:06:24.083
TWENTY THOUSAND FAMILIES ARE IN

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.618
DEEP POVERTY.

00:06:25.685 --> 00:06:27.887
THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT WHOSE

00:06:27.954 --> 00:06:29.622
NEEDS WOULD BE ADDRESSED BY THE

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:31.891
TARGETED CHILD TAX CREDIT AND

00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.693
REALLY ONLY BY THE TARGET THE

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.961
CHILD TAX CREDIT.

00:06:35.027 --> 00:06:37.897
SO THESE ARE THE FOLKS THAT ARE

00:06:37.964 --> 00:06:38.965
FACING.

00:06:39.031 --> 00:06:41.334
SONIC INSTABILITY IN TERMS OF

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.604
ACTIONS -- HOUSING AND SECURITY --

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.806
IN AND OUT OF HOMELESSNESS --

00:06:46.873 --> 00:06:49.509
BROKEN CARS EXPIRING TELEPHONE

00:06:49.575 --> 00:06:54.580
CONTRACTS -- I ON UNRELIABLE

00:06:54.647 --> 00:06:56.182
CHILD CARE.

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:57.917
AND SO THE PROBLEM IS UNLESS WE

00:06:57.984 --> 00:07:00.787
ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES OF BASIC

00:07:00.853 --> 00:07:01.754
STABILITY.

00:07:01.821 --> 00:07:04.423
THESE ARE FOLKS THAT CAN'T BEGIN

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.125
TO CLIMB THE ECONOMIC LADDER AND

00:07:06.192 --> 00:07:08.728
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CAL WORKS IN

00:07:08.795 --> 00:07:09.996
THE I. T. C..

00:07:10.062 --> 00:07:11.697
WE'VE GOT AT LEAST A PROVIDE

00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:13.833
THAT STABILITY SO THAT THEY'RE

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.568
ABLE TO TO USE THAT AS A

00:07:15.635 --> 00:07:18.004
FOUNDATION. TO THEN TAKE

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.841
ADVANTAGE OF CAL WORKS AND AND

00:07:21.908 --> 00:07:22.341
THE I. T. C. [inaudible]

00:07:22.408 --> 00:07:23.943
THE ALONG THAT SAME LINE THE

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:26.045
PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE A FIVE

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:27.046
HUNDRED DOLLAR.

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:29.882
TAX CREDIT. TO FAMILIES IS AN

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:32.251
EXCELLENT PROPOSAL AND AND AND

00:07:32.318 --> 00:07:33.820
WE STRONGLY RECOMMENDED TO MOVE

00:07:33.886 --> 00:07:35.688
FORWARD.

00:07:35.755 --> 00:07:37.690
BUT WE HAVE TO BE CLEAR.

00:07:37.757 --> 00:07:40.126
DAD ADDRESSES SHALLOW POVERTY.

00:07:40.193 --> 00:07:41.794
AND THAT ADDRESSES THE FOLKS

00:07:41.861 --> 00:07:43.362
THAT ARE NEAR POVERTY SO IT'S

00:07:43.429 --> 00:07:44.764
VERY IMPORTANT.

00:07:44.831 --> 00:07:47.600
IT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUES

00:07:47.667 --> 00:07:48.434
PEOPLE.

00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:50.837
WHO PEOPLE OVER IN DEEP POVERTY

00:07:50.903 --> 00:07:53.439
THAT AVERAGE BENEFIT JUST TO

00:07:53.506 --> 00:07:55.007
MOVE PEOPLE FROM WHERE THEY ARE?

00:07:55.074 --> 00:07:57.610
TO ABOVE THE DEEP POVERTY LINE

00:07:57.677 --> 00:07:59.612
WILL BE ABOUT FORTY EIGHT

00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:00.947
HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR.

00:08:01.013 --> 00:08:01.981
AND SO WE HAVE TO BE VERY

00:08:02.048 --> 00:08:03.850
COGNIZANT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

00:08:03.916 --> 00:08:05.785
THESE OTHER BENEFITS THAT

00:08:05.852 --> 00:08:08.387
THEY'RE NOT ADDRESSING THE

00:08:08.454 --> 00:08:10.056
PROBLEM OF DEEP.

00:08:10.122 --> 00:08:12.391
POVERTY IN THE STATE.

00:08:12.458 --> 00:08:14.260
THE THE FINAL POINT I'D LIKE TO

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:15.761
MAKE IS THAT THIS IS THE THIS

00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:17.196
OBVIOUSLY ACOSTA ISSUE.

00:08:17.263 --> 00:08:19.232
LONG TERM THIS PAYS FOR ITSELF

00:08:19.298 --> 00:08:20.633
MANY TIMES OVER.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.134
SHORT TERM THERE ARE THERE ARE

00:08:22.201 --> 00:08:24.070
THERE ARE SOME COSTS.

00:08:24.136 --> 00:08:25.504
BUT IT'S IT'S REALLY I THINK

00:08:25.571 --> 00:08:27.473
VERY SIMILAR TO IF IF YOU'RE

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.408
GONNA MAKE A OF BRIDGE.

00:08:29.475 --> 00:08:34.180
EARTHQUAKE SAFE -- IF.

00:08:34.247 --> 00:08:37.116
AND KNOCKS A HOLE IN THE ROOF.

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:38.784
BOTH ISSUES OF DEFECTS THOSE

00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:40.586
THINGS.

00:08:40.653 --> 00:08:42.955
AND THE THE ISSUE IS YOU

00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:46.392
PROBABLY DO BECAUSE IT'S A

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:47.793
PRIORITY FOR YOU.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.996
AND SO I THINK ONE THING THAT'S

00:08:50.062 --> 00:08:52.398
CRUCIAL IS THIS IS LOOKED AT IS

00:08:52.465 --> 00:08:53.966
OUR FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:08:54.033 --> 00:08:55.334
THOUSAND CHILDREN IN THE STATE.

00:08:55.401 --> 00:08:57.270
A SUFFICIENT PRIORITY TO SAY WE

00:08:57.336 --> 00:08:59.739
NEED TO DO IT TO TO SPEND THE

00:08:59.805 --> 00:09:01.040
MONEY SHORT TERM.

00:09:01.107 --> 00:09:03.643
IN ORDER TO HAVE THE LONG TERM

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:06.245
BENEFITS OF THOSE PARENTS BEING

00:09:06.312 --> 00:09:08.047
ABLE TO WORK BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT

00:09:08.114 --> 00:09:10.216
STABILITY AND THE CHILDREN BEING

00:09:10.283 --> 00:09:12.218
ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EARLY

00:09:12.285 --> 00:09:14.253
CHILDHOOD EDUCATION IN SCHOOL

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.821
BECAUSE OF THEIR ENTER NOT A

00:09:15.888 --> 00:09:17.490
HOMELESSNESS THE REALITY IS.

00:09:17.556 --> 00:09:19.659
THEY'RE NOT ABLE.

00:09:19.725 --> 00:09:21.427
TO ADJUST THE JUST THE MARTELLO

00:09:21.494 --> 00:09:23.562
FROM WESTERN CENTER WAS THE

00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:26.499
CHAIR OF THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET

00:09:26.565 --> 00:09:28.200
SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE LIFTING

00:09:28.267 --> 00:09:30.736
CHILDREN AND FAMILIES OUT OF

00:09:30.803 --> 00:09:33.940
POVERTY TASK FORCE.

00:09:34.006 --> 00:09:35.808
CHECK A MORNING MEMBERS OF THE

00:09:35.875 --> 00:09:36.409
COMMITTEE JUST GIVE OUR FLOW

00:09:36.475 --> 00:09:37.176
WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:37.843
AND POVERTY AND ALSO ON THAT THE

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.879
TEAM CHILDREN OUT OF A PARTY

00:09:39.946 --> 00:09:41.147
TASK FORCE.

00:09:41.213 --> 00:09:42.548
MY JOB TODAY IS JUST TO BRIEFLY

00:09:42.615 --> 00:09:45.651
REMIND YOU WHY IT IS IMPORTANT

00:09:45.718 --> 00:09:46.218
TO ADDRESS THE POVERTY AMONG

00:09:46.285 --> 00:09:47.954
CHILDREN -- AS YOU KNOW DE

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.089
POVERTY HAS AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT

00:09:50.156 --> 00:09:52.224
ON CHILDREN A NEGATIVE IMPACT --

00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:53.192
PREVENTING THEM FROM

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:55.294
PARTICIPATING IN THEIR COMMUNITY

00:09:55.361 --> 00:09:56.996
AND IN THEIR SCHOOLS FOR

00:09:57.063 --> 00:09:58.130
COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE HIGH

00:09:58.197 --> 00:09:59.732
NUMBERS OF KIDS ANTI POVERTY.

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:01.133
THE ENTIRE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT IS

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.868
COMPROMISED THE INVESTMENTS THAT

00:10:02.935 --> 00:10:04.437
OUR STATE AKES AN EDUCATION ARE

00:10:04.503 --> 00:10:05.504
COMPROMISED.

00:10:05.571 --> 00:10:06.839
AT THE INVESTMENTS THAT OUR

00:10:06.906 --> 00:10:08.341
STATE MAKES IN HEALTH FOR THESE

00:10:08.407 --> 00:10:09.542
CHILDREN ARE ALSO COMPROMISE

00:10:09.608 --> 00:10:11.344
BECAUSE IT NOT ONLY IMPACTS

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:11.911
CHILDREN'S PARTICIPATION IN

00:10:11.978 --> 00:10:13.179
SCHOOL.

00:10:13.245 --> 00:10:15.414
BUT ALSO -- INC S..

00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:16.716
INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT

00:10:16.782 --> 00:10:18.351
THESE CHILDREN WILL SUFFER FROM

00:10:18.417 --> 00:10:19.919
THE TOXIC STRESS CAUSED BY DEEP

00:10:19.986 --> 00:10:21.721
POVERTY TOXIC STRESS HAS BOTH

00:10:21.787 --> 00:10:22.989
LONG TERM AND SHORT TERM

00:10:23.055 --> 00:10:27.159
CONSEQUENCES -- INCLUDING

00:10:27.226 --> 00:10:28.728
DEPRESSION.

00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:29.662
THEY'VE IDENTIFIED DEPRESSION

00:10:29.729 --> 00:10:30.963
AMONG INFANTS.

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:32.531
AS YOUNG AS FOUR MONTHS OLD.

00:10:32.598 --> 00:10:34.300
AND THEY EXPERIENCE BASICALLY

00:10:34.367 --> 00:10:37.803
DESPERATION. FOUR MONTHS OLD --

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:39.071
THE LACK OF BASIC NEEDS

00:10:39.138 --> 00:10:42.908
CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY -- TO

00:10:42.975 --> 00:10:47.013
MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH -- CRISIS.

00:10:47.079 --> 00:10:49.248
AND AS YOU'VE PROBABLY READ --

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:50.683
MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH AT

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:53.152
PROBLEMS AND AND MATERNAL --

00:10:53.219 --> 00:10:55.588
DEPRESSION IS ONE OF THE

00:10:55.654 --> 00:10:57.223
CONTRIBUTING FACTORS -- TO

00:10:57.289 --> 00:10:58.391
CHILDREN NOT BEING READY FOR

00:10:58.457 --> 00:10:59.825
SCHOOL BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS

00:10:59.892 --> 00:11:01.861
DON'T INTERACT WITH THEM AND YOU

00:11:01.927 --> 00:11:02.461
CAN ONLY IMAGINE IF YOU HAVE

00:11:02.528 --> 00:11:03.162
CHILDREN.

00:11:03.229 --> 00:11:04.296
ARE YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO DO HAVE

00:11:04.363 --> 00:11:05.698
CHILDREN NOTHING ABLE TO MEET

00:11:05.765 --> 00:11:08.200
THE BASIC NEEDS OF YOUR CHILDREN --

00:11:08.267 --> 00:11:09.935
AND AND WHAT KIND OF MENTAL

00:11:10.002 --> 00:11:11.670
HEALTH CRISIS THAT WOULD CREATE

00:11:11.737 --> 00:11:13.105
AND SO DISTANCE CRATES BETWEEN

00:11:13.172 --> 00:11:14.540
THE CHILDREN AND THE MOTHER THEY

00:11:14.607 --> 00:11:16.242
DON'T READ TO THEM THEY DON'T

00:11:16.308 --> 00:11:17.877
SING TO THEM NO CODDLED EARLY

00:11:17.943 --> 00:11:20.279
HOLD THEM AS AS MUCH -- AND THE

00:11:20.346 --> 00:11:21.847
DATA IS THERE TO SHOW THAT -- I

00:11:21.914 --> 00:11:23.649
DO HAVE ALSO A DOCUMENT THAT I

00:11:23.716 --> 00:11:24.984
WILL EMAIL THE COMMITTEE WITH

00:11:25.051 --> 00:11:28.087
CITATIONS FOR EACH OF THE POINTS

00:11:28.154 --> 00:11:28.921
I MAKING.

00:11:28.988 --> 00:11:30.056
DEEP POVERTY IS SO DANGEROUS TO

00:11:30.122 --> 00:11:31.824
CHILDREN AT THAT ONE STUDY

00:11:31.891 --> 00:11:33.225
SHOWED THAT -- GROWING UP ANTI

00:11:33.292 --> 00:11:35.061
POVERTY MORE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED

00:11:35.127 --> 00:11:37.663
A CHILD AND THEIR LIFE CHANCES

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:39.165
THE NEONATAL.

00:11:39.231 --> 00:11:43.736
EXPOSURE TO COCAINE.

00:11:43.803 --> 00:11:46.138
THE POVERTY IS A PUBLIC HEALTH

00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:48.307
CRISIS IT'S THE PUBLIC HEALTH

00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:50.342
CRISIS AND AND THE MOST AMAZING

00:11:50.409 --> 00:11:52.678
THING AS BEFORE TODAY WE'VE HAD

00:11:52.745 --> 00:11:54.213
PLANS FOR HOW TO ADDRESS THE

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.948
POVERTY WITHIN POCKETS.

00:11:56.015 --> 00:11:57.149
OF THE COMMUNITY THERE WAS

00:11:57.216 --> 00:11:58.984
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT ON THE FLOOR

00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:01.487
LAST YEAR IN SUPPORT OF ENDING

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:02.188
THE POVERTY FOR THE COUCH

00:12:02.254 --> 00:12:05.191
PROGRAM -- IN SB NINE EIGHTY TWO

00:12:05.257 --> 00:12:06.559
AND WE APPRECIATED THAT BILL --

00:12:06.625 --> 00:12:08.160
AND THERE HAS BEEN MOVEMENT AND

00:12:08.227 --> 00:12:09.361
REDUCING AT THE POVERTY WITHIN

00:12:09.428 --> 00:12:11.297
CAL WORKS THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

00:12:11.363 --> 00:12:12.198
THAT A PROPOSAL HAS COME FORWARD

00:12:12.264 --> 00:12:13.999
AND SAID WE WILL ANDY POVERTY

00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:14.867
FOR ALL CHILDREN.

00:12:14.934 --> 00:12:16.102
IT'S A PRIORITY OF OUR STATE TO

00:12:16.168 --> 00:12:19.171
DO SO -- AS AS A BODY ELECTRIC

00:12:19.238 --> 00:12:20.773
ELECTED BODY BUT ALSO AS AS A

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:21.740
COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE IN

00:12:21.807 --> 00:12:22.808
CALIFORNIA.

00:12:22.875 --> 00:12:24.009
WE CAN CONTINUE TO POINT OUR

00:12:24.076 --> 00:12:26.011
FINGERS AT THE PARENTS TO SAY

00:12:26.078 --> 00:12:26.979
YOU OUGHT TO BE DOING MORE TO

00:12:27.046 --> 00:12:28.581
TAKE CARE OF YOUR KIDS BUT EACH

00:12:28.647 --> 00:12:30.015
TIME WE DO THAT UNTIL THE KIDS

00:12:30.082 --> 00:12:32.818
ARE OUT OF THE POVERTY. FOUR

00:12:32.885 --> 00:12:34.286
FINGERS ARE POINTING BACK AT US.

00:12:34.353 --> 00:12:35.855
SO THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO

00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:37.022
SAY TO THE CHILDREN IN

00:12:37.089 --> 00:12:38.224
CALIFORNIA WE BELIEVE IN YOU NO

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:39.525
MATTER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES YOU

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:41.360
GROW UP IN -- WE BELIEVE YOU

00:12:41.427 --> 00:12:43.662
HAVE A FUTURE HERE IN CALIFORNIA

00:12:43.729 --> 00:12:44.263
AND WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:45.564
YOU DO [inaudible]

00:12:45.631 --> 00:12:47.399
IN CLOSING.

00:12:47.466 --> 00:12:49.668
AND I LIKE TO SAY THAT SOME OF

00:12:49.735 --> 00:12:51.337
THESE KIDS HOPEFULLY. ONE DAY

00:12:51.403 --> 00:12:53.339
WE'LL COMES TO TO BE HERE TO BE

00:12:53.405 --> 00:12:54.907
WHERE I'M SIT SITTING OR WHERE

00:12:54.974 --> 00:12:56.075
YOU'RE SITTING.

00:12:56.142 --> 00:12:58.477
AND A LOOK BACK AT TODAY AND IF

00:12:58.544 --> 00:12:59.678
WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE THESE

00:12:59.745 --> 00:13:01.747
CHANGES THE LOOK BACK AND LOOK

00:13:01.814 --> 00:13:03.449
AT THE VOTES FROM TODAY -- AND

00:13:03.516 --> 00:13:04.783
FROM THE DECISIONS OF THIS BODY

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:07.586
AND KNOW THAT THOSE DECISIONS

00:13:07.653 --> 00:13:09.054
HELP THEM GET TO WHERE THEY ARE.

00:13:09.121 --> 00:13:10.589
IF WE DIDN'T MAKE THIS CHOICE

00:13:10.656 --> 00:13:11.857
AND THEY SUFFERED GREATLY IF

00:13:11.924 --> 00:13:13.259
THEIR SIBLINGS WERE STUCK IN

00:13:13.325 --> 00:13:15.728
POVERTY IF THEIR LIFE CHANCES --

00:13:15.794 --> 00:13:17.930
ARE TRUNCATED OR THEY EXPERIENCE

00:13:17.997 --> 00:13:19.431
DEBILITATING AND PAINFUL

00:13:19.498 --> 00:13:21.033
LIFELONG DISEASES BECAUSE OF THE

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.935
TALKS EXPRESS EXPERIENCE IN DEEP

00:13:23.002 --> 00:13:23.969
POVERTY.

00:13:24.036 --> 00:13:25.471
THE LHASA REMEMBER WHO'S.

00:13:25.538 --> 00:13:27.473
WHO'S VOTE I WASN'T CATH I'M FOR

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.408
THAT TO BE PREVENTED.

00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:30.876
I KNOW AS AS SOMEBODY WHO'S A

00:13:30.943 --> 00:13:32.278
MYSELF EXPERIENCE CHILDHOOD

00:13:32.344 --> 00:13:34.547
DEPRIVATION OF OF BASIC NEEDS.

00:13:34.613 --> 00:13:36.749
I HAVE GONE BACK TO SEE WHO

00:13:36.815 --> 00:13:38.984
VOTED AGAINST MY INTERESTS AS A

CHAOS -- AND THE CHAOS IS

00:15:06.205 --> 00:15:07.406
CREATED BY THE FACT THAT THERE

ORDER TO KEEP THE OVERALL COST

00:19:12.551 --> 00:19:13.719

WHEN FULLY UTILIZE TEN YEARS OUT --

WHEN AT THAT POINT YOU'D HAVE?

00:19:20.959 --> 00:19:22.895
A NORM IS COST SAVINGS FROM IT

00:19:22.961 --> 00:19:25.397
WOULD BE TWO POINT FOUR BILLION.

00:19:25.464 --> 00:19:27.533
BUT AT THAT POINT THE RETURNS

00:19:27.599 --> 00:19:30.102
FROM IT IN TERMS OF REDUCED

COMING FROM THAT.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.161
YOU HAVE -- REDUCE

00:19:56.228 --> 00:19:58.096

ACTUALLY THE THE FEWER YEARS YOU

00:20:09.541 --> 00:20:11.176
SPEND IN THE PROPERTIES A CHILD

00:20:11.243 --> 00:20:13.378
THE LESS LIKELY YOU ARE TO IT TO

00:20:13.445 --> 00:20:15.013
BE ANTI POVERTY AS AN ADULT AND

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:15.981

COMPREHENSIVE AND COORDINATED.

00:21:42.034 --> 00:21:43.669
AND ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IN THE

00:21:43.735 --> 00:21:44.469
PAST.

00:21:44.536 --> 00:21:46.405
IS THAT WHAT THAT ISN'T THE WAY

00:21:46.471 --> 00:21:49.007

00:21:56.181 --> 00:21:57.582
CREDIT THESE THINGS WORK

00:21:57.649 --> 00:21:59.618
TOGETHER WE CAN'T JUST DO ONE

00:21:59.685 --> 00:22:00.519
THING.

00:22:00.585 --> 00:22:02.320
IT'S A TOP RATED COMPREHENSIVE

00:22:02.387 --> 00:22:04.189
COORDINATED APPROACH SELF THIS

IS PART OF THE CONTINUUM THAT

00:22:06.358 --> 00:22:08.326

THAT THEY NEED.

00:22:29.414 --> 00:22:30.882
WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS

00:22:30.949 --> 00:22:32.617
IS THAT THEY CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE

00:22:32.684 --> 00:22:33.952

IT IS CROSSES OUR COLLECTION AND

00:37:42.126 --> 00:37:43.361
DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM SO WE

COLLECT APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY

00:37:45.129 --> 00:37:46.263
BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR.

IS OUR BOOKKEEPING AND EXPENSE

00:37:57.675 --> 00:37:59.276

THAT SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS.

00:38:01.045 --> 00:38:02.546

00:38:05.182 --> 00:38:08.219
INTO FISTS GAL.

00:38:08.285 --> 00:38:10.388
AND OF RECORD SO THEY THEY DO

00:38:10.454 --> 00:38:11.055
INTEGRATE WE ARE THAT WE DO HAVE

00:38:11.122 --> 00:38:12.223
A PROJECT TO LINK THE TWO

00:38:12.289 --> 00:38:13.624
SYSTEMS TOGETHER WHICH IS VERY

00:38:13.691 --> 00:38:15.593
IMPORTANT GIVEN THE THE NUMBER

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:16.827
REVENUES WE HAVE.

00:38:16.894 --> 00:38:17.995
AND HOW'S IT GOING.

00:38:18.062 --> 00:38:19.764

WELL I MEAN.

00:38:20.765 --> 00:38:23.034
WE STILL WE'VE CLOSED A MONTH IN

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:24.568
FISCALE -- THERE STILL IS

00:38:24.635 --> 00:38:27.438
TEETHING GOING ON TO BE HONEST --

00:38:27.505 --> 00:38:30.007
BUT WE WERE WORKING CLOSELY WITH

00:38:30.074 --> 00:38:31.976
BOTH CROSS SANTA SCALE TEAMS TO

00:38:32.043 --> 00:38:34.478
MAKE SURE THAT THAT LINK -- DOES

00:38:34.545 --> 00:38:36.080
HAPPEN -- AND HAPPEN SMOOTHLY.

00:38:36.147 --> 00:38:38.249

00:38:43.487 --> 00:38:45.690
OKAY.

00:38:45.756 --> 00:38:46.924
AND THEN THERE'S A REASON THAT

00:38:46.991 --> 00:38:49.160
WE HAVE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS TO

00:38:49.226 --> 00:38:53.397

00:39:10.047 --> 00:39:12.216
NEWNESS OF IGNORANCE.

00:39:12.283 --> 00:39:14.652
IT WOULD BE SMARTER IF WE WERE

00:39:14.719 --> 00:39:15.619
STARTING OVER AGAIN THEY HAVE

00:39:15.686 --> 00:39:19.757
THEM COMBINED.

00:39:19.824 --> 00:39:21.459

SORRY.

00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:30.220
YOU GO FIRST.

00:51:30.287 --> 00:51:30.854
OKAY.

00:51:30.921 --> 00:51:32.489
YOU ASKED US TO PREPARE SOME

00:51:32.556 --> 00:51:34.191
BACKGROUND ON THE STATE'S IN

00:51:34.257 --> 00:51:35.892
EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND SO

00:51:35.959 --> 00:51:37.994
WE PREPARE THIS HAND OUT TO

00:51:38.061 --> 00:51:38.595
EXPLAIN.

00:51:38.662 --> 00:51:40.664
SOME OF IT.

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:42.165
THE CREDITS HISTORY IN WHAT.

00:51:42.232 --> 00:51:44.768
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND ARE

00:51:44.835 --> 00:51:48.238
A EVALUATION OF THE OKAY.

00:51:48.305 --> 00:51:50.874
PAGE ONE OF THE HANDOUT SHOWS

00:51:50.941 --> 00:51:52.876
THE GRAPH OF WHAT WE LIKE TO

00:51:52.943 --> 00:51:54.478
CALL THE VOLCANO CHART WHICH

00:51:54.544 --> 00:51:57.714
SHOWS OF HOW THE CURRENT FEDERAL.

00:51:57.781 --> 00:51:59.216
EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT IS

00:51:59.282 --> 00:52:01.685
STRUCTURED.

00:52:01.751 --> 00:52:04.788
SO ON THIS GRAPH THE HORIZONTAL

00:52:04.855 --> 00:52:06.923
AXIS SHOWS THAT THE THE TAX

00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:10.160
FILERS INCOME BEFORE CALCULATING

00:52:10.227 --> 00:52:11.795
YOUR AND INCOME TAX CREDIT.

00:52:11.862 --> 00:52:14.064
IN THE VERTICAL AXIS SHOWS THE

00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:16.766
AMOUNT OF THE E. I. T. C. THAT

00:52:16.833 --> 00:52:19.102
THEY WOULD BE ELIGIBLE.

00:52:19.169 --> 00:52:21.872
FOR SO AS YOU CAN SEE ARM.

00:52:21.938 --> 00:52:24.774
AT VERY LOW LEVELS OF INCOME.

00:52:24.841 --> 00:52:26.376
WE'RE UP FOR IN WHAT WE CALL THE

00:52:26.443 --> 00:52:28.245
PHASE IN RANGE WHERE THE CREDIT

00:52:28.311 --> 00:52:30.213
AMOUNT IS INCREASING AS THE

00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:32.682
FILERS EARNED INCOME INCREASES.

00:52:32.749 --> 00:52:34.084
AND EARNED INCOME ISN'T THEIR

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:36.119
TOTAL INCOME IS JUST TO FIND AS

00:52:36.186 --> 00:52:38.255
THEIR WAGES AND SALARIES ARE IN

00:52:38.321 --> 00:52:39.523
THERE'S PLUS THEIR SELF

00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:41.224
EMPLOYMENT INCOME SO ITS INCOME

00:52:41.291 --> 00:52:42.325
THAT COMES FROM WORK.

00:52:42.392 --> 00:52:44.327
AS OPPOSED TO COMING FROM OTHER

00:52:44.394 --> 00:52:45.695
SOURCES.

00:52:45.762 --> 00:52:46.463
SO.

00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:47.964
UP THROUGH IN INCOME LEVEL OF

00:52:48.031 --> 00:52:50.367
ABOUT.

00:52:50.433 --> 00:52:51.201
FOURTEEN THOUSAND THE AMOUNT OF

00:52:51.268 --> 00:52:53.770
THE A. T. C. INCREASES AS THE

00:52:53.837 --> 00:52:56.306
FILINGS INCOME INCREASES AT A

00:52:56.373 --> 00:52:58.441
RATE OF ABOUT 40%.

00:52:58.508 --> 00:53:01.778
SO THAT AT THE THE P. E. I. T.

00:53:01.845 --> 00:53:03.847
C. LEVEL WHICH YOU REACH AN

00:53:03.914 --> 00:53:05.715
INCOME OF ABOUT FOR A LITTLE

00:53:05.782 --> 00:53:06.983
OVER.

00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:07.851
FOURTEEN THOUSAND THE EITC

00:53:07.918 --> 00:53:11.354
AMOUNT IS A LITTLE BIT BELOW.

00:53:11.421 --> 00:53:12.489
SIX THOUSAND OKAY SO THEN

00:53:12.556 --> 00:53:15.592
THERE'S OF WHAT WE CALL A FLAT

00:53:15.659 --> 00:53:16.726
RANGE OF THE A. T. C..

00:53:16.793 --> 00:53:18.261
ARM BACK UP.

00:53:18.328 --> 00:53:20.931
THIS GRAPH SHOWS WHAT A FILER.

00:53:20.997 --> 00:53:22.432
A SINGLE PARENT WITH TWO

00:53:22.499 --> 00:53:24.801
ELIGIBLE DEPENDENT CHILDREN WILL

00:53:24.868 --> 00:53:27.103
GET. FOR FILERS WITH ONE

00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:28.605
DEPENDENT CHILD -- ELIGIBLE

00:53:28.672 --> 00:53:30.340
DEPENDENT THESE AMOUNTS ARE

00:53:30.407 --> 00:53:32.642
SOMEWHAT LOWER FOR THREE EITHER

00:53:32.709 --> 00:53:33.810
SOMEWHAT HIGHER.

00:53:33.877 --> 00:53:36.413
IF THE FILE HAS NO DEPENDENCE NO

00:53:36.479 --> 00:53:37.981
ELIGIBLE DEPENDENTS IT'S A LOT

00:53:38.048 --> 00:53:40.517
LOWER.

00:53:40.584 --> 00:53:42.419
BUT FOR SIMPLICITY AND TO AVOID

00:53:42.485 --> 00:53:43.987
CLUTTERING UP THE GRAPH WE ONLY

00:53:44.054 --> 00:53:45.255
SHOWED IT.

00:53:45.322 --> 00:53:46.656
FOR TWO PEOPLE WITH TWO KIDS TO

00:53:46.723 --> 00:53:49.192
SHOW HOW THE BUT BASICALLY HOW

00:53:49.259 --> 00:53:51.094
THE FEDERAL EITC WAS BECAUSE A

00:53:51.161 --> 00:53:52.596
QUESTION SO I DON'T GET.

00:53:52.662 --> 00:53:54.097
FURTHER LOST -- I'M LOOKING AT

00:53:54.164 --> 00:53:56.466
THE CHART.

00:53:56.533 --> 00:54:00.303
AND I THINK YOU SAID THAT --

00:54:00.370 --> 00:54:03.340
RIGHT THERE YES -- OKAY BECAUSE

00:54:03.406 --> 00:54:04.207
ARE REVEALED THAT IS THE

00:54:04.274 --> 00:54:05.609
QUESTION THERE WE GO.

00:54:05.675 --> 00:54:09.879
OKAY.

00:54:09.946 --> 00:54:13.216
PERFECT NO I'M NOT AS OKAY.

00:54:13.283 --> 00:54:14.017
OKAY SO AFTER YOU HIT THE PEAK

00:54:14.084 --> 00:54:14.818
THERE'S WHAT'S CALLED A FLAT

00:54:14.884 --> 00:54:15.785
RANGE OF THE A. T. C. GOES UP TO

00:54:15.852 --> 00:54:17.988
ABOUT NINETEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:54:18.054 --> 00:54:18.888
OF INCOME AT WHICH YOU KNOW.

00:54:18.955 --> 00:54:19.656
SO IN THAT WHOLE RANGE BETWEEN

00:54:19.723 --> 00:54:21.992
ABOUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND AND

00:54:22.058 --> 00:54:23.460
NINETEEN THOUSAND OF THE FILES

00:54:23.526 --> 00:54:26.630
FEDERAL EITC AMOUNT IS THE SAME.

00:54:26.696 --> 00:54:28.865
THEN THE CREDIT STARTS TO PHASE

00:54:28.932 --> 00:54:31.001
OUT AS THE FILERS INCOME

00:54:31.067 --> 00:54:32.535
INCREASES AND SO.

00:54:32.602 --> 00:54:34.037
AS THE GRAPH SHOWS IT

00:54:34.104 --> 00:54:35.605
PROPORTIONALLY GOES YOU KNOW

00:54:35.672 --> 00:54:36.906
GETS LOWER AND LOWER AND LOWER

00:54:36.973 --> 00:54:39.709
UNTIL YOU HIT IN INCOME OF ABOUT

00:54:39.776 --> 00:54:40.276
FORTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS A

00:54:40.343 --> 00:54:41.444
YEAR AT WHICH POINT YOUR

00:54:41.511 --> 00:54:44.381
INELIGIBLE FOR THE CREDIT.

00:54:44.447 --> 00:54:49.719
SO THAT'S AGAINST.

00:54:49.786 --> 00:54:51.254
HER ON TO WHICH THE STATE HIS.

00:54:51.321 --> 00:55:01.131
YOU KNOW CRAFTED IT.

00:55:01.197 --> 00:55:02.966
TEEN LOOKS LIKE [inaudible]

00:55:03.033 --> 00:55:06.436
AND SO THIS CHART HAS THE SAME.

00:55:06.503 --> 00:55:09.005
SAME SCALE AS THE CHART ON PAGE.

00:55:09.072 --> 00:55:10.106
ONE BUT AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S

00:55:10.173 --> 00:55:12.475
GEARED -- MUCH MORE TOWARD

00:55:12.542 --> 00:55:14.210
PEOPLE AT THE LOWEST AT THE

00:55:14.277 --> 00:55:16.446
LOWEST END OF THE INCOME SCALE

00:55:16.513 --> 00:55:16.846
THERE [inaudible]

00:55:16.913 --> 00:55:19.282
SO.

00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:21.284
UP THROUGH AN AGAIN WE'RE

00:55:21.351 --> 00:55:23.319
SHOWING IT OUT FOR A FILE WITH

00:55:23.386 --> 00:55:24.521
TWO DEPENDENTS.

00:55:24.587 --> 00:55:26.690
UP THROUGH AN INCOME OF ABOUT

00:55:26.756 --> 00:55:28.558
SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH IS

00:55:28.625 --> 00:55:32.128
ABOUT HALF OF THE THE INCOME IN

00:55:32.195 --> 00:55:33.530
THE FEDERAL PHASE IN RANGE.

00:55:33.596 --> 00:55:35.732
IT INCREASES IT ALMOST THE SAME

00:55:35.799 --> 00:55:37.901
RATE THE FEDERAL EITC DOES IT'S

00:55:37.967 --> 00:55:40.804
AT A RATEOF 34% COMPARED 240%

00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:42.105
FOR THE FEDERAL.

00:55:42.172 --> 00:55:44.207
SO WHAT IN INCOME OF SEVEN

00:55:44.274 --> 00:55:45.175
THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:55:45.241 --> 00:55:47.577
A STATE EITC FILE WOULD COLLECT

00:55:47.644 --> 00:55:50.547
A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN.

00:55:50.613 --> 00:55:51.181
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED BUT AT THAT

00:55:51.247 --> 00:55:52.248
POINT.

00:55:52.315 --> 00:55:54.317
THE STATE CREDIT STARTS TO PHASE

00:55:54.384 --> 00:55:56.052
OUT AT THE SAME RATE THAT IF

00:55:56.119 --> 00:55:57.020
THEY USED IN.

00:55:57.087 --> 00:55:58.388
SO BY THE TIME YOU'RE IN INCOME

00:55:58.455 --> 00:56:00.290
AROUND FOURTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:56:00.356 --> 00:56:01.858
WHICH IS THE THE END OF THE

00:56:01.925 --> 00:56:05.261
FEDERAL PHASE IN RANGE THE STATE

00:56:05.328 --> 00:56:08.398
CREDIT IS GOING.

00:56:08.465 --> 00:56:09.699
TO ZERO AGAIN THIS CRAFT IS NOT

00:56:09.766 --> 00:56:11.634
SHOW WOULD A FILING WITH ONE

00:56:11.701 --> 00:56:13.403
DEPENDENT OR A FILE WITH THREE

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:14.738
OR MORE DEPENDENTS GETS.

00:56:14.804 --> 00:56:16.339
ITS SLIGHTLY MORE GENEROUS THAN

00:56:16.406 --> 00:56:17.707
THIS FOR FILING WITH THREE OR

00:56:17.774 --> 00:56:18.641
MORE DEPENDENTS IT'S

00:56:18.708 --> 00:56:20.910
CONSIDERABLY LESS GENEROUS FOR

00:56:20.977 --> 00:56:22.245
FILER WITH ONE DEPENDENT.

00:56:22.312 --> 00:56:24.380
A WE DO SHOW WAIT A FILE WITH NO

00:56:24.447 --> 00:56:26.216
DEPENDENTS GETS IN AS YOU CAN

00:56:26.282 --> 00:56:28.952
SEE IT'S A AT THAT POINT IT WAS

00:56:29.018 --> 00:56:31.387
NOT VERY MUCH -- THIS IS SIMILAR

00:56:31.454 --> 00:56:32.956
TO WHAT THE FEDERAL CREDIT DOES

00:56:33.022 --> 00:56:34.224
THE AMOUNTS FOR FILERS WITH NO

00:56:34.290 --> 00:56:37.026
DEPENDENTS ARE MUCH SMALLER THAN

00:56:37.093 --> 00:56:38.528
THE FILE THE AMOUNTS FOR FILERS

00:56:38.595 --> 00:56:42.065
WHO HAVE DEPENDENTS.

00:56:42.132 --> 00:56:44.367
ALSO THE WHEN THE STATE CREDIT

00:56:44.434 --> 00:56:47.036
WAS IMPLEMENTED IN -- TWO

00:56:47.103 --> 00:56:47.904
THOUSAND FIFTEEN SELF EMPLOYMENT

00:56:47.971 --> 00:56:56.112
INCOME WAS NOT COUNTED TOWARDS --

00:56:56.179 --> 00:56:56.579
DO.

CREDIT WAS EXPANDED IN TWO

00:57:02.719 --> 00:57:04.888
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IN TWO

00:57:04.954 --> 00:57:05.522
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OF SITES THAT.

00:57:05.588 --> 00:57:06.422
FREQUENT.

00:57:06.489 --> 00:57:08.224
ON THEM WHEN THEY CREATED IT DO

00:57:08.291 --> 00:57:10.660
YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE.

00:57:10.727 --> 00:57:12.128
YES ISN'T.

00:57:12.195 --> 00:57:14.164
IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN A LITTLE

00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:16.766
LESS THAN UNDER FOUR HUNDRED

00:57:16.833 --> 00:57:18.268
THOUSAND FILERS TOOK THE CREDIT.

00:57:18.334 --> 00:57:19.636
IN THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE

00:57:19.702 --> 00:57:21.504
CREDIT WAS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED

00:57:21.571 --> 00:57:23.072
MILLION DOLLARS.

00:57:23.139 --> 00:57:26.643
AT THE STATE LEVEL.

00:57:26.709 --> 00:57:28.211
THANK YOU OKAY.

00:57:28.278 --> 00:57:30.346

00:57:30.413 --> 00:57:33.049
CREDIT WAS EXPANDED IN

00:57:33.116 --> 00:57:34.551
200-017-2000.

00:57:34.617 --> 00:57:36.586
EIGHTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND

00:57:36.653 --> 00:57:37.620
SEVENTEEN THE STATE RAISE THE

00:57:37.687 --> 00:57:40.957
INCOME LIMITS CONSIDERABLY.

00:57:41.024 --> 00:57:43.860
AND ALSO THE THEY DECIDED TO

00:57:43.927 --> 00:57:46.162
ALLOW SELF EMPLOYMENT INCOME TO

00:57:46.229 --> 00:57:47.263
COUNT WHICH YOU KNOW BRINGS THE

00:57:47.330 --> 00:57:49.365
STATE CREDIT IN MORE IN LINE

00:57:49.432 --> 00:57:51.267
WITH THE FEDERAL CREDIT ON THAT --

00:57:51.334 --> 00:57:52.802
IN THAT WAY.

00:57:52.869 --> 00:57:54.537
IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE

00:57:54.604 --> 00:57:57.707
INCOME LIMITS WERE RAISED AGAIN.

00:57:57.774 --> 00:57:59.576
BOB AND SO NOW UNDER CURRENT LAW

00:57:59.642 --> 00:58:02.345
THE INCOME LIMIT IS ABOUT

00:58:02.412 --> 00:58:03.012
SEVENTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A

00:58:03.079 --> 00:58:05.248
LITTLE LESS AND SEVENTEEN

00:58:05.315 --> 00:58:05.815
THOUSAND FOR FILERS WITH NO

00:58:05.882 --> 00:58:06.683
DEPENDENTS.

00:58:06.749 --> 00:58:08.685
IN JUST UNDER TWENTY FIVE

00:58:08.751 --> 00:58:10.854
THOUSAND PER FILERS WHO HAVE

00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:11.788
DEPENDENTS.

00:58:11.855 --> 00:58:14.591
THE OTHER CHANGE WAS MADE IN TWO

00:58:14.657 --> 00:58:15.124
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IS IT.

00:58:15.191 --> 00:58:17.193
FILERS WHO HAVE NO DEPENDENTS

00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:19.495
AND ARE EITHER YOUNGER THAN AGE

00:58:19.562 --> 00:58:21.130
TWENTY FIVE OR OLDER THAN AGE

00:58:21.197 --> 00:58:22.699
SIXTY FIVE WERE MADE ELIGIBLE

00:58:22.765 --> 00:58:23.633
FOR THE A..

00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:25.869
OF THESE FILERS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE

00:58:25.935 --> 00:58:27.770
FOR THE FEDERAL EITC SO THAT'S

00:58:27.837 --> 00:58:30.673
SORT OF THE ONE OF ONE RESPECT

00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:32.942
IN WHICH THE STATE EITC IS MORE

00:58:33.009 --> 00:58:34.444
GENEROUS THAN THE FEDERAL EITC

00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:35.645
IT COVERS SOME OF THESE PEOPLE

00:58:35.712 --> 00:58:38.314
WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL

00:58:38.381 --> 00:58:39.415
CREDIT.

00:58:39.482 --> 00:58:42.185
NOW THE CHART SHOWS HOW.

00:58:42.252 --> 00:58:43.987
THE I. E. A. T. STRUCTURE LOOKS

00:58:44.053 --> 00:58:45.555
NOW.

00:58:45.622 --> 00:58:47.023
IN AS YOU CAN SEE THERE IS A YOU

00:58:47.090 --> 00:58:49.125
KNOW PRETTY STEEP ASCENT TO THE

00:58:49.192 --> 00:58:50.260
PEAK IN THAT IS STEEP BUT

00:58:50.326 --> 00:58:52.295
DESCENT ONCE YOU GET ONCE YOU

00:58:52.362 --> 00:58:55.765
HIT THE PEAK.

00:58:55.832 --> 00:58:57.467
NOW YOU CAN SEE THERE'S SORT OF

00:58:57.533 --> 00:59:01.070
A LONG TAIL AT THE END THAT --

00:59:01.137 --> 00:59:01.771
WHEN THE INCOME LIMITS FOR

00:59:01.838 --> 00:59:04.574
EXTENDED THE AMOUNTS THAT WENT

00:59:04.641 --> 00:59:05.808
TO PEOPLE WHO MAY WHO WERE

00:59:05.875 --> 00:59:08.177
ELIGIBLE FOR THE CREDIT BEFORE

00:59:08.244 --> 00:59:10.880
WORK KEPT FAIRLY LOW I MEAN THIS

00:59:10.947 --> 00:59:12.048
IS SORT OF BY DESIGN IS A?

00:59:12.115 --> 00:59:13.283
THERE IS A LIMITED AMOUNT OF

00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:14.817
MONEY THAT WAS AVAILABLE TO

00:59:14.884 --> 00:59:16.119
EXPAND THE ATC.

00:59:16.185 --> 00:59:17.754
THE UP.

00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:18.821
THE LEGISLATURE MADE THE

00:59:18.888 --> 00:59:21.958
DECISION TO OFFERS NO CUT IN

00:59:22.025 --> 00:59:23.459
EXPANSION THAT WAS FAIRLY BROAD

00:59:23.526 --> 00:59:25.828
ALTHOUGH NOT ESPECIALLY GENEROUS

00:59:25.895 --> 00:59:27.063
FOR ANY OF THE NEW FILERS.

00:59:27.130 --> 00:59:29.532
SO.

00:59:29.599 --> 00:59:32.235
YEAH WELL MORE PEOPLE CAN CLAIM

00:59:32.302 --> 00:59:33.569
THE EITC THE FOR PEOPLE WHO

00:59:33.636 --> 00:59:34.771
WEREN'T ELIGIBLE FOR THE

00:59:34.837 --> 00:59:36.105
ORIGINAL VERSION THE AMOUNTS

00:59:36.172 --> 00:59:37.140
THAT THEY GET ARE NOT ALL THAT

00:59:37.206 --> 00:59:38.775
HIGH IN.

00:59:38.841 --> 00:59:40.043
THE SORT THE TAIL EXHORTED EVEN

00:59:40.109 --> 00:59:41.844
MORE EXAGGERATED FOR FILERS WITH

00:59:41.911 --> 00:59:42.946
NO DEPENDENTS BECAUSE YOU'RE

00:59:43.012 --> 00:59:45.415
GOING FROM A LIMIT OF ABOUT

00:59:45.481 --> 00:59:50.687
SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO LIMIT --

00:59:50.753 --> 00:59:52.021
TO SEVEN IN THEIR THE RECEIVE

00:59:52.088 --> 00:59:54.390
FAIRLY MODEST AMOUNTS.

00:59:54.457 --> 00:59:58.027
PAGE FOR TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS.

00:59:58.094 --> 00:59:58.227
YEAH.

00:59:58.294 --> 01:00:04.200
AROUND THAT.

01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:05.234
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE

01:00:05.301 --> 01:00:07.036
AMOUNTS CLAIMING IT HAVE CHANGED

01:00:07.103 --> 01:00:08.371
OVER TIME.

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:10.440
IN FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN UNDER THE

01:00:10.506 --> 01:00:12.075
ORIGINAL VERSION.

01:00:12.141 --> 01:00:14.377
ABOUT A LITTLE LESS THAN FOUR

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:15.144
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR FILERS

01:00:15.211 --> 01:00:16.913
TOOK THE CREDIT EVERY YEAR IN

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:18.314
THE AMOUNT WAS AROUND TWO

01:00:18.381 --> 01:00:19.349
HUNDRED THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT

01:00:19.415 --> 01:00:20.883
THAT THEY WERE ELIGIBLE FOR WAS

01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:22.618
AROUND TWO HUNDRED MILLION.

01:00:22.685 --> 01:00:24.120
NOW IN SEVENTEEN AFTER THE

01:00:24.187 --> 01:00:25.288
EXPANSION.

01:00:25.355 --> 01:00:27.290
THE NUMBER OF FILERS WHO TOOK IT

01:00:27.357 --> 01:00:29.025
NO ROSE BY NEARLY IN NEARLY

01:00:29.092 --> 01:00:31.494
QUADRUPLED SO IN NEARLY A

01:00:31.561 --> 01:00:32.795
MILLION AND A HALF PEOPLE.

01:00:32.862 --> 01:00:35.198
OR NOT PEOPLE NEARLY MIL MILLION

01:00:35.264 --> 01:00:37.633
AND A HALF RETURNS HAD THE ATC

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:39.168
ON IT ACTUALLY IT REPRESENTS A

01:00:39.235 --> 01:00:40.536
LOT MORE THAN A MILLION AND A

01:00:40.603 --> 01:00:42.438
HALF PEOPLE BECAUSE MOST RETURNS

01:00:42.505 --> 01:00:45.608
ESPECIALLY FOR THE IDC.

01:00:45.675 --> 01:00:46.075
ARE GOING TO HAVE SOME

01:00:46.142 --> 01:00:48.277
DEPENDENCE ON THEM -- THE TOTAL

01:00:48.344 --> 01:00:51.214
AMOUNT OF THE A. T. C. WENT UP

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:51.781
TO THREE HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT

01:00:51.848 --> 01:00:52.615
MILLION SO THE AVERAGE CREDIT

01:00:52.682 --> 01:00:54.083
AMOUNT AS YOU CAN SEE GOT A LOT

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:55.084
LOWER.

01:00:55.151 --> 01:00:56.819
AND THIS IS MOSTLY BECAUSE THE

01:00:56.886 --> 01:00:58.554
MOST OF THE NEW FILERS RING THAT

01:00:58.621 --> 01:01:01.057
LONG TAIL AND WERE ELIGIBLE FOR

01:01:01.124 --> 01:01:02.592
RELATIVELY SMALL E. I. T. C.

01:01:02.658 --> 01:01:03.426
AMOUNTS.

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:04.394
SO WITH IT REALLY GROW THE

01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:06.929
NUMBER OF THOSE ON THE LOWER

01:01:06.996 --> 01:01:08.364
INCOME.

01:01:08.431 --> 01:01:10.566
SIGN NO WITH THE EXPANSIONS IN

01:01:10.633 --> 01:01:11.234
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:12.869
EIGHTEEN HAD RELATIVELY LITTLE

01:01:12.935 --> 01:01:15.271
AFFECT ON PEOPLE AT THE LOWEST

01:01:15.338 --> 01:01:16.739
END OF THE INCOME DISTRIBUTION

01:01:16.806 --> 01:01:18.574
AND LESLIE AT SELF EMPLOYMENT

01:01:18.641 --> 01:01:19.776
INCOME.

01:01:19.842 --> 01:01:21.577
OR IN LESS THE WERE -- SINGLE

01:01:21.644 --> 01:01:24.213
FILERS WHO WERE UNDER TWENTY

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:25.148
FIVE ARE OVER.

01:01:25.214 --> 01:01:25.782
SIXTY FIVE DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH

01:01:25.848 --> 01:01:28.985
WE'RE REALLY REACHING IN TERMS

01:01:29.052 --> 01:01:32.622
OF THE ELIGIBLE -- TAXPAYERS

01:01:32.688 --> 01:01:34.257
IT'S HARD TO GET A HANDLE ON

01:01:34.323 --> 01:01:37.026
THAT BUT IT 40% OR TWENTY YEAR

01:01:37.093 --> 01:01:38.961
PROBABLY CLOSE PROBABLY CLICK

01:01:39.028 --> 01:01:41.431
MORE LIKE SEVENTY BUT IT'S HARD

01:01:41.497 --> 01:01:42.932
TO GET A HANDLE ON THAT BECAUSE

01:01:42.999 --> 01:01:45.768
TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO USE THE

01:01:45.835 --> 01:01:47.770
DATA FROM THE CENSUS BUREAU.

01:01:47.837 --> 01:01:51.707
AND THE INCOME DEFINITIONS --

01:01:51.774 --> 01:01:53.042
FOR FOR TAX PURPOSES DON'T

01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:54.510
REALLY MATCH UP ALL THAT WELL

01:01:54.577 --> 01:01:56.379
THE INCOME DEFINITIONS IT THE

01:01:56.446 --> 01:01:59.382
CENSUS USES SO IT'S IT'S KIND

01:01:59.449 --> 01:02:00.716
IT'S KIND OF UNCLEAR HOW MANY

01:02:00.783 --> 01:02:02.118
PEOPLE WERE.

01:02:02.185 --> 01:02:04.253
ILL WITH THE POPULATION IS THAT

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:06.589
YOU KNOW IS ELIGIBLE FOR THIS

01:02:06.656 --> 01:02:09.559
BUT ISN'T TAKING ADVANTAGE OF IT.

01:02:09.625 --> 01:02:12.195
OKAY AND WE DO HAVE SO AT THIS

01:02:12.261 --> 01:02:14.430
POINT SOME PRELIMINARY DATA FOR

01:02:14.497 --> 01:02:17.166
A TAX YEAR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

01:02:17.233 --> 01:02:17.834
FOR WHICH PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:19.969
FILING THEIR RETURNS YOU KNOW.

01:02:20.036 --> 01:02:21.704
SINCE JANUARY.

01:02:21.771 --> 01:02:24.373
SO FAR OVER ONE POINT THREE

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:27.076
MILLION FILE FILERS HAVE ALREADY

01:02:27.143 --> 01:02:28.744
CLAIMED THE E. A. T. C.. FOR

01:02:28.811 --> 01:02:32.482
THIS YEAR WHICH IS I BELIEVE --

01:02:32.548 --> 01:02:34.917
AHEAD OF THE SCHEDULE FROM LAST

01:02:34.984 --> 01:02:40.756
YEAR DO YOU. ONE MOMENT PLEASE.

FOR NOW.

01:02:49.198 --> 01:02:53.169
WE HAVE YET [inaudible]

01:02:53.236 --> 01:02:53.536

WITH.

01:02:56.706 --> 01:02:58.040
LAST YEAR FOR THE TOTAL NUMBER

01:02:58.107 --> 01:03:00.443
OF OF FILERS AND THIS TIME

01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:00.743

OKAY -- NO WE'RE LOOKING THE

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:09.652
WRONG THINGS.

01:03:09.719 --> 01:03:10.620
A MISTAKE YES IT'S ABOUT A

01:03:10.686 --> 01:03:11.988
MILLION AND US ONE POINT.

01:03:12.054 --> 01:03:13.589
THREE OKAY SO IT'S THAT'S SO FOR

01:03:13.656 --> 01:03:15.491
ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:03:15.558 --> 01:03:17.960
MORE FILERS THE LAST YEAR

01:03:18.027 --> 01:03:18.261
[inaudible]

SO [inaudible]

01:03:18.661 --> 01:03:19.395
OKAY.

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:21.230
PAGE FIVE SHOWS THE GOVERNOR'S

01:03:21.297 --> 01:03:23.499
PROPOSED THE ATC EXPANSION

01:03:23.566 --> 01:03:23.799
[inaudible]

01:03:23.866 --> 01:03:25.301
SO.

01:03:25.368 --> 01:03:26.836
ON THIS GRAPH.

01:03:26.903 --> 01:03:29.105
THE SOLID LINES SHOW THE CURRENT

01:03:29.172 --> 01:03:30.973
EA T. C..

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:32.775

PROPOSED -- EXPANDED THE ATC.

01:03:37.647 --> 01:03:41.717
AND SO IT IS YOU CAN SEE THE THE

01:03:41.784 --> 01:03:43.686
PROPOSED EXPANSION DOES NOT

01:03:43.753 --> 01:03:46.923

01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:58.201
MORE SLOWLY.

01:03:58.267 --> 01:03:59.969
HE USES THE TERMINOLOGY I WAS

01:04:00.036 --> 01:04:01.804
USING EARLIER THE TALE OF THE

01:04:01.871 --> 01:04:04.507
ATC IS NOW GETTING HIGHER AND

01:04:04.574 --> 01:04:08.411
LONGER. FOR FILE IS WITH WITH

01:04:08.477 --> 01:04:09.812
TWO DEPENDENTS.

01:04:09.879 --> 01:04:11.948
AND SHOWN HERE.

01:04:12.014 --> 01:04:14.517
IF YOUR INCOME IS ABOUT YOU SAY

01:04:14.584 --> 01:04:15.117
THIRTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OR

01:04:15.184 --> 01:04:17.286
MORE YOU GET A YOU START TO GET

01:04:17.353 --> 01:04:19.555
A OF IN THE INCREASE THE ATC

01:04:19.622 --> 01:04:21.557
AMOUNT.

01:04:21.624 --> 01:04:23.759
AND AROUND THE CURRENT KING

01:04:23.826 --> 01:04:25.595
POINT IS ACTUALLY WHERE THE THE

01:04:25.661 --> 01:04:27.296
BIGGEST INCREASE COMES WHICH IS

01:04:27.363 --> 01:04:29.365
A LITTLE BIT BELOW [inaudible]

01:04:29.432 --> 01:04:31.467
FIFTEEN THOUSAND NO.

01:04:31.534 --> 01:04:34.070
THE INCOME LIMITSFOR ALL FILERS

01:04:34.136 --> 01:04:36.105
ARE BEING EXTENDED TO THIRTY

01:04:36.172 --> 01:04:37.373
THOUSAND DOLLARS WHETHER YOU

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:38.541
HAVE KIDS OR NOT SO THAT'S IT.

01:04:38.608 --> 01:04:40.243
THAT IN AND OF ITSELF IS A

01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:41.811
BIGGER INCREASE FOR PEOPLE WHO

01:04:41.877 --> 01:04:44.213
DON'T HAVE KIDS DEPENDENCE.

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.781
BUT AS YOU CAN SEE THE AMOUNTS

01:04:45.848 --> 01:04:46.749
FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE

01:04:46.816 --> 01:04:48.184
DEPENDENTS ARE NOT ESPECIALLY

01:04:48.251 --> 01:04:50.553
LARGE COMPARED TO THE AMOUNTS

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:52.521
FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE DEPENDENTS.

01:04:52.588 --> 01:04:55.424
SO THE PEOPLE IN THE THE FILE IS

01:04:55.491 --> 01:04:56.993
NEW CLOSER TO THE UPPER END OF

01:04:57.059 --> 01:04:58.494
THE CURRENT INCOME DISTRIBUTION

01:04:58.561 --> 01:04:59.595
WILL GET A BIT MORE OF AN

01:04:59.662 --> 01:05:01.163
INCREASE.

01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:02.665
THEN THE THE FILERS WHO WERE AT

01:05:02.732 --> 01:05:04.200
THE LOWER END WHO WON'T SEE AN

01:05:04.267 --> 01:05:05.635
INCREASE.

01:05:05.701 --> 01:05:07.737
FROM THIS PARTICULAR FROM THIS A

01:05:07.803 --> 01:05:12.141
COMPONENT OF IT. FOR FILERS WHO

01:05:12.208 --> 01:05:13.476
ARE WHO DO NOT HAVE ANY

01:05:13.542 --> 01:05:15.911
DEPENDENCE THE KING DISAPPEARS

01:05:15.978 --> 01:05:18.047
AND SO YOU INSTEAD YOU JUST GET

01:05:18.114 --> 01:05:21.050
A GRADUAL DECLINE.

01:05:21.117 --> 01:05:22.485
ONCE YOU HIT THE OF ONCE YOUR

01:05:22.551 --> 01:05:25.988
INCOME PASSES THE THE AMOUNT FOR

01:05:26.055 --> 01:05:27.189
WHICH YOU GET THE P. D. A. T. C.

01:05:27.256 --> 01:05:28.824
YOU GET A GRADUAL DECLINE ALL

01:05:28.891 --> 01:05:31.160
THE WAY TO THE NEW INCOME LIMIT

01:05:31.227 --> 01:05:31.727
OF THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A

01:05:31.794 --> 01:05:33.629
YEAR.

01:05:33.696 --> 01:05:35.498
AND THE OTHER THING THAT THE A

01:05:35.564 --> 01:05:37.133
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DOES THAT IS

01:05:37.199 --> 01:05:38.701
NOT SHOWN.

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:41.337
IS IT FILERS WHO HAVE SILLY SOME

01:05:41.404 --> 01:05:44.106
INCOME SOME ELIGIBLE INCOME.

01:05:44.173 --> 01:05:46.042
AND AT LEAST ONE DEPENDENT UNDER

01:05:46.108 --> 01:05:48.511
THE AGE OF SIX WILL GET FIVE

01:05:48.577 --> 01:05:50.046
HUNDRED DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL

01:05:50.112 --> 01:05:51.280
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS NOW WILL BE

01:05:51.347 --> 01:05:53.516
THE SAME AS IF THAT BE THE SAME

01:05:53.582 --> 01:05:54.583
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IF YOU HAVE

01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:56.252
ONE KID UNDER THE AGE OF SIX IS

01:05:56.319 --> 01:05:57.486
IF YOU HAVE.

01:05:57.553 --> 01:05:58.921
SIX IT'S JUST IS IF YOU HAVE ANY

01:05:58.988 --> 01:06:01.390
ELIGIBLE DEPENDENTS UNDER THE

01:06:01.457 --> 01:06:03.125
AGE OF SIXTY GET A FLAT FIVE

01:06:03.192 --> 01:06:03.659
HUNDRED DOLLARS THE ONLY

01:06:03.726 --> 01:06:05.328
EXCEPTION TO THAT IS IF YOUR

01:06:05.394 --> 01:06:06.696
INCOME.

01:06:06.762 --> 01:06:09.065
IS ABOVE TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND

01:06:09.131 --> 01:06:09.799
DOLLARS THE AMOUNT PHASES OUT

01:06:09.865 --> 01:06:11.367
PROPORTIONATELY AS YOU GET TO

01:06:11.434 --> 01:06:13.703
THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.

01:06:13.769 --> 01:06:15.471
SO YOU COULDN'T GET THAT IF

01:06:15.538 --> 01:06:18.374
YOU'RE A 300-003-0000 DOLLARS IT

01:06:18.441 --> 01:06:22.078
WOULD BE ZERO OR NOT YEAH.

01:06:22.144 --> 01:06:22.812
THIRTY THOUSAND IS THE MAX

01:06:22.878 --> 01:06:23.412
INCOME.

01:06:23.479 --> 01:06:26.349
YES FOR ANY OF THIS YES

01:06:26.415 --> 01:06:26.649
[inaudible]

01:06:26.716 --> 01:06:28.851
OKAY.

01:06:28.918 --> 01:06:30.219
PAGE SIX SOME.

01:06:30.286 --> 01:06:32.455
SHOWS THE LA OWES ASSESSMENT OF

01:06:32.521 --> 01:06:34.457
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL.

01:06:34.523 --> 01:06:36.225
AND SO THIS PROPOSAL WOULD REACH

01:06:36.292 --> 01:06:37.793
A LOT OF PEOPLE WE ESTIMATE THAT

01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:39.228
IT WOULD NO MORE THAN TWO

01:06:39.295 --> 01:06:41.130
MILLION CALIFORNIA FILERS WOULD

01:06:41.197 --> 01:06:43.232
BENEFIT FROM THIS.

01:06:43.299 --> 01:06:45.000
SPENT IN MOST OF THESE PEOPLE

01:06:45.067 --> 01:06:47.370
WOULD BE BELOW THE POVERTY LINE

01:06:47.436 --> 01:06:49.004
OR NOT TOO FAR ABOVE IT.

01:06:49.071 --> 01:06:51.841
NOW THAT SAID BECAUSE YOU KNOW.

01:06:51.907 --> 01:06:53.409
THIS PROPOSAL REALLY KIND OF

01:06:53.476 --> 01:06:54.844
GOES BROAD INSTEAD A DEEP IT

01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:56.912
PROVIDES A MODEST BENEFIT TO A

01:06:56.979 --> 01:06:59.248
VERY LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE --

01:06:59.315 --> 01:07:00.616
THEY WOULDN'T MOVE ALL THAT MANY

01:07:00.683 --> 01:07:02.451
PEOPLE ABOVE THE POVERTY LINE

01:07:02.518 --> 01:07:03.819
WHO WERE PREVIOUSLY BELOW WHAT

01:07:03.886 --> 01:07:05.354
WE ESTIMATE THAT IT WOULD MOVE

01:07:05.421 --> 01:07:08.124
ROUGHLY. FIFTY THOUSAND FILERS

01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:09.892
FROM BELOW THE POVERTY LINE TO

01:07:09.959 --> 01:07:11.727
ABOVE IT IN MAYBE TWELVE

01:07:11.794 --> 01:07:12.728
THOUSAND FILERS OUT OF DEEP

01:07:12.795 --> 01:07:15.364
POVERTY WHICH IS DEFINED AS HALF

01:07:15.431 --> 01:07:16.932
THE POVERTY LEVEL.

01:07:16.999 --> 01:07:18.801
SO IT'S IT'S KIND OF SIMILAR TO

01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:21.237
THE THE SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN

01:07:21.303 --> 01:07:22.505
EXPANSIONS AND IN IN THAT IT'S

01:07:22.571 --> 01:07:23.973
SOME.

01:07:24.039 --> 01:07:25.441
IT GIVES A MODEST BENEFIT TO A

01:07:25.508 --> 01:07:26.642
LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE AS

01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:28.010
OPPOSED TO A MORE SUBSTANTIAL

01:07:28.077 --> 01:07:30.846
BENEFIT TO A SMALLER NUMBER

01:07:30.913 --> 01:07:31.147
[inaudible]

01:07:31.213 --> 01:07:34.884
OKAY -- WE DON'T EXPECT IT THIS

01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:36.051
PROPOSAL WOULD HAVE A HUGE

01:07:36.118 --> 01:07:37.753
IMPACT ON THE NUMBER OF HOURS

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:39.989
THAT PEOPLE WORK.

01:07:40.055 --> 01:07:41.357
THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT.

01:07:41.424 --> 01:07:44.193
THE MAIN EFFECTIVE THE EITC ON

01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:46.228
LABOR MARKETS IS.

01:07:46.295 --> 01:07:47.963
TO IN ARMED PEOPLE WHO MIGHT

01:07:48.030 --> 01:07:49.532
OTHERWISE YOU KNOW NOT HAVE

01:07:49.598 --> 01:07:50.699
WORKED IN THE FORMAL LABOR

01:07:50.766 --> 01:07:51.867
MARKET AT ALL.

01:07:51.934 --> 01:07:54.603
SO WITH.

01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:57.540
ON THE OTHER HAND IT -- TENDS

01:07:57.606 --> 01:07:59.875
NOT TO HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON

01:07:59.942 --> 01:08:01.343
PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY WORKING

01:08:01.410 --> 01:08:02.478
IT DOESN'T.

01:08:02.545 --> 01:08:04.280
IT DOESN'T MUCH AFFECT THE

01:08:04.346 --> 01:08:05.514
NUMBER OF HOURS THEY WORK YOU

01:08:05.581 --> 01:08:07.283
KNOW CONDITIONAL ON ALREADY ON

01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:09.084
ON THEM ALREADY BEING IN THE

01:08:09.151 --> 01:08:10.920
FORMAL WORKFORCE.

01:08:10.986 --> 01:08:13.622
AND SO AS A IN VIEW IS THIS WE

01:08:13.689 --> 01:08:17.193
DON'T EXPECT A HUGE IMPACT FROM --

01:08:17.259 --> 01:08:18.861
THIS PROPOSAL ON LABOR HOURS

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:21.197
BECAUSE THE THE MAIN INCREASE IN

01:08:21.263 --> 01:08:23.265
BENEFIT GOES TO PEOPLE WHO WERE.

01:08:23.332 --> 01:08:24.733
YOU KNOW.

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:26.702
AT THE MAIL TOWARD THE UPPER END

01:08:26.769 --> 01:08:28.170
OF THE EITC ELIGIBLE

01:08:28.237 --> 01:08:32.475
DISTRIBUTION WHICH IS -- WHICH

01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:34.109
IS IT WE EXPECT THIS TO MOSTLY

01:08:34.176 --> 01:08:35.578
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY IN

01:08:35.644 --> 01:08:37.213
THE WORK FORCE I MEAN THE PRICE

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:38.714
WILL PROBABLY HAVE SOME IMPACT

01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:40.549
IN TERMS OF DRAWING NEW PEOPLE

01:08:40.616 --> 01:08:42.084
IN THAT BECAUSE THE BENEFITS ARE.

01:08:42.151 --> 01:08:43.752
SORT OF TILTED TOWARD THE UPPER

01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:46.088
END OF THIS -- THIS ELIGIBLE

01:08:46.155 --> 01:08:47.656
RANGE WE THINK IT WOULD BE --

01:08:47.723 --> 01:08:49.125
PROBABLY SMALLER THAN IF THE

01:08:49.191 --> 01:08:50.893
BENEFITS WERE TILTED MORE FOR

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:54.797
THE LOWER AND OKAY -- THE LAST

01:08:54.864 --> 01:08:56.298
THING WE WOULD ADD IS THAT THERE

01:08:56.365 --> 01:08:57.867
ARE A NUMBER OF WAYS IN WHICH

01:08:57.933 --> 01:09:01.737
THE LEGISLATURE COULD -- TRY --

01:09:01.804 --> 01:09:02.771
TO GIVE WORKING PARENTS IN

01:09:02.838 --> 01:09:04.139
INCOME BOOST ONE OTHER THING WE

01:09:04.206 --> 01:09:05.641
WOULD.

01:09:05.708 --> 01:09:07.176
WHAT SUGGEST AS A POSSIBLE

01:09:07.243 --> 01:09:09.311
ALTERNATIVE FOR ADDITION TO WITH

01:09:09.378 --> 01:09:11.113
THIS IS A?

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:12.882
THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BE -- TO

01:09:12.948 --> 01:09:14.783
TAKE THE CURRENT CHILDCARE

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:15.918
CREDIT THAT'S ON THE BOOKS RIGHT

01:09:15.985 --> 01:09:17.786
NOW.

01:09:17.853 --> 01:09:20.389
THE AND MAKE IT REFUNDABLE AGAIN

01:09:20.456 --> 01:09:20.689
[inaudible]

01:09:20.756 --> 01:09:22.591
AND SO.

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:24.260
WE THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW THIS

01:09:24.326 --> 01:09:25.661
COULD BE.

01:09:25.728 --> 01:09:27.363
IT CAN BE MADE REFUNDABLE AGAIN

01:09:27.429 --> 01:09:29.365
AS IT WAS BEFORE TWO THOUSAND

01:09:29.431 --> 01:09:31.767
TEN AND POSSIBLY EXPANDED EVEN.

01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:33.769
FOR COST OF YOU KNOW AROUND A

01:09:33.836 --> 01:09:34.970
HUNDRED MILLION OR SO.

01:09:35.037 --> 01:09:36.272
ANNUALLY.

01:09:36.338 --> 01:09:38.040
NOW WE WOULD NOTE THAT THIS

01:09:38.107 --> 01:09:38.974
WOULD IT.

01:09:39.041 --> 01:09:40.676
POSE A LIKE THAT WOULD HELP

01:09:40.743 --> 01:09:41.977
PEOPLE IN A SOMEWHAT.

01:09:42.044 --> 01:09:43.245
WOULD HELP A SOMEWHAT HIGHER

01:09:43.312 --> 01:09:44.680
INCOME POPULATION IN THE

01:09:44.747 --> 01:09:46.448
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD

01:09:46.515 --> 01:09:47.483
BECAUSE KERR.

01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:50.052
MAKING THE CHILD CARE CREDIT

01:09:50.119 --> 01:09:51.720
REFUNDABLE WOULD PROBABLY HELP

01:09:51.787 --> 01:09:53.656
PEOPLE UP TO AN INCOME OF

01:09:53.722 --> 01:09:55.157
ROUGHLY SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:09:55.224 --> 01:09:56.759
COMPARED TO THIRTY THOUSAND

01:09:56.825 --> 01:09:58.561
DOLLARS IN THIS CREDIT.

01:09:58.627 --> 01:10:00.563
ON THE OTHER HAND THE THE CHILD

01:10:00.629 --> 01:10:01.830
CARE CREDIT THAT'S ON THE BOOKS

01:10:01.897 --> 01:10:03.232
RIGHT NOW.

01:10:03.299 --> 01:10:06.835
SEEMS A LITTLE BIT --

01:10:06.902 --> 01:10:09.805
INCONGRUOUS IS THE IS A SORT OF

01:10:09.872 --> 01:10:11.840
ANTI POVERTY POLICY BECAUSE IT'S

01:10:11.907 --> 01:10:14.677
NOT REFUNDABLE IN THERE FOR IT.

01:10:14.743 --> 01:10:16.178
PROVIDES NO BENEFIT TO THE

01:10:16.245 --> 01:10:18.147
LOWEST INCOME FILERS WHO DON'T

01:10:18.213 --> 01:10:20.616
HAVE ANY -- THAT LIABILITY AFTER

01:10:20.683 --> 01:10:25.721
A THEIR CREDITS ARE CALCULATED.

01:10:25.788 --> 01:10:26.855
AND SO WOULD.

01:10:26.922 --> 01:10:29.525
TAKE QUESTIONS NOW YEAH.

01:10:29.592 --> 01:10:30.759
ALL OF THESE [inaudible]

01:10:30.826 --> 01:10:32.962
SOLD.

01:10:33.028 --> 01:10:33.128
IF.

01:10:33.195 --> 01:10:35.931
YOU KNOW.

01:10:35.998 --> 01:10:37.466
WHICH ALREADY HAS WHAT.

01:10:37.533 --> 01:10:38.901
DO WITH THE OTHER.

01:10:38.968 --> 01:10:43.639
SO HERE'S THE YOU CAN DO THAT

01:10:43.706 --> 01:10:44.607
EASIER THAN I CAN THERE'S THOSE

01:20:24.319 --> 01:20:24.986
THE CREDIT.

01:20:25.053 --> 01:20:25.787
SO THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE

CHANGES IN FEDERAL POLICY.

01:20:46.141 --> 01:20:48.243
AND THEY WOULD THEN BECOME AN

01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:50.745

01:20:50.812 --> 01:20:51.846
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALLOWS

WANTED TURN NEXT TO JUST

01:22:09.391 --> 01:22:11.259
HIGHLIGHT THREE KEY POINTS --

01:22:11.326 --> 01:22:13.295
FOR WHY INCLUDING INDIVIDUALS

01:22:13.361 --> 01:22:14.963
THESE INDIVIDUALS IN THE ALLEY

01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:15.597
TO SEE COULD BE WELL WORTHWHILE

01:22:15.664 --> 01:22:16.364
INVESTMENT.

01:22:16.431 --> 01:22:17.799
ANSWER TURNING TO THE TO THE

HAND OUT -- THAT I PROVIDED --

01:22:20.902 --> 01:22:24.606
SO AS SHOWN ON THE SECOND PAGE

01:22:24.673 --> 01:22:25.607
OF THE HANDOUT. ONE KEY

01:22:25.674 --> 01:22:26.274
CONSIDERATION IS THAT IMMIGRANTS

01:22:26.341 --> 01:22:26.908
ARE REALLY VITAL TO CALIFORNIA'S

01:22:26.975 --> 01:22:28.443
LABOR FORCE.

01:22:28.510 --> 01:22:30.345
SO -- WE ALL KNOW OUR STATE IS

01:22:30.412 --> 01:22:31.980
AN ECONOMIC POWER HOUSE WE HAVE

01:22:32.047 --> 01:22:33.515
THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE

01:22:33.581 --> 01:22:35.850
WORLD ROUGHLY ONE SEVENTH OF THE

01:22:35.917 --> 01:22:37.385
NATIONAL ECONOMY.

01:22:37.452 --> 01:22:38.987
AS A STATE WE CAN TRAP YOU ABOUT

01:22:39.054 --> 01:22:40.121
ONE AND A HALF TIMES AS MUCH TO

01:22:40.188 --> 01:22:42.924
NATIONAL GDP AS ANY OTHER STATE --

01:22:42.991 --> 01:22:44.459
AND WE COULD NOT BE THE ECONOMIC

01:22:44.526 --> 01:22:46.394
POWER HOUSE WITHOUT THE

01:22:46.461 --> 01:22:47.362
CONTRIBUTIONS OF IMMIGRANT

01:22:47.429 --> 01:22:49.497
WORKERS -- AS THIS -- CHART

01:22:49.564 --> 01:22:51.466
SHOWS IMMIGRANTS -- MAKE UP ONE

01:22:51.533 --> 01:22:52.834
AND THREE WORKERS IN THE STATE.

01:22:52.901 --> 01:22:54.069
AND ALSO I THINK THE FACT THAT

01:22:54.135 --> 01:22:56.004
NEARLY ONE IN FIVE WORKERS IN

01:22:56.071 --> 01:22:58.173
THE STATE ARE YOU ES BORN BUT

01:22:58.239 --> 01:22:58.940
GREW UP AS THE CHILDREN OF

01:22:59.007 --> 01:22:59.474
IMMIGRANTS.

01:22:59.541 --> 01:23:00.742
HOW IT'S THE FACT THAT INVESTING

01:23:00.809 --> 01:23:02.143
IN THE ECONOMIC SECURITY OF

01:23:02.210 --> 01:23:04.012
IMMIGRANT FAMILIES -- IS AN

01:23:04.079 --> 01:23:07.015
INVESTMENT IN OUR STATE'S

01:23:07.082 --> 01:23:10.251
ECONOMIC FUTURE AS WELL.

01:23:10.318 --> 01:23:12.354
TURNING TO THE NEXT SLIDE OVER

01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:15.223
THE NEXT -- CHARTS -- I WANT TO

01:23:15.290 --> 01:23:15.757

IMMIGRANTS WHO DO NOT HAVE

01:23:17.559 --> 01:23:18.993
SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS AND SO

01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:20.328
ARE CURRENTLY EXCLUDED FROM THE

01:23:20.395 --> 01:23:21.229

SHOWN IN THIS CHART -- WITH THE

01:23:26.835 --> 01:23:29.104
ESTIMATE IS THAT THREE POINT TWO

01:23:29.170 --> 01:23:30.839
BILLION DOLLARS.

01:23:30.905 --> 01:23:31.973
STATE AND LOCAL TAXES ARE MADE

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:34.042
BY -- UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS IN

THAT.

01:23:37.479 --> 01:23:38.546
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS ALSO

01:23:38.613 --> 01:23:39.981
MAKE MAJOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO

01:23:40.048 --> 01:23:42.217
FEDERAL TAXES AND RECENT TAX

01:23:42.283 --> 01:23:43.118
POLICY CHANGES AT THE FEDERAL

01:23:43.184 --> 01:23:44.519
LEVEL HAVE REDUCED THE

01:23:44.586 --> 01:23:45.620
ELIGIBILITY OF IMMIGRANT

01:23:45.687 --> 01:23:47.856
FAMILIES FOR FEDERAL TAX CREDITS.

01:23:47.922 --> 01:23:49.190
SO SPECIFICALLY THE TAX CUTS AND

01:23:49.257 --> 01:23:52.961
AT BACK AND JOBS ACT TO CHANGE

01:23:53.027 --> 01:23:54.796
THE ELIGIBILITY FOR THE FEDERAL

01:23:54.863 --> 01:23:56.831
CHILD TAX CREDIT. TO REQUIRE

01:23:56.898 --> 01:23:58.199
THAT ALL CHILDREN CLAIM FOR THE

01:23:58.266 --> 01:23:59.667
CREDIT MUST HAVE A SOCIAL

01:23:59.734 --> 01:24:01.503
SECURITY NUMBER VALID FOR WORK --

01:24:01.569 --> 01:24:02.804
SO ESSENTIALLY THIS TAKE AWAY

01:24:02.871 --> 01:24:04.072
ELIGIBILITY FOR THE FEDERAL

01:24:04.139 --> 01:24:05.840
CHILD TAX CREDIT FOR CHILDREN

01:24:05.907 --> 01:24:07.275
WHO ARE DREAMERS -- AND MADE

01:24:07.342 --> 01:24:08.676
THEIR FAMILIES ELIGIBLE INSTEAD

01:24:08.743 --> 01:24:10.044
FOR A MUCH SMALLER CREDIT THAT

01:24:10.111 --> 01:24:11.946
IS NOT REFUNDABLE SAID

01:24:12.013 --> 01:24:13.615
PARTICULARLY DISADVANTAGES --

01:24:13.681 --> 01:24:15.683
LOW INCOME IMMIGRANT FAMILIES

01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:16.985
AND THEIR CHILDREN -- SO THAT

01:24:17.051 --> 01:24:18.620
YOU COULD SAY THAT THE PROPOSAL

01:24:18.686 --> 01:24:21.122
TO ALLOW AYE TENDS TO BE USED.

01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:23.491
FOR THE CALIFORNIA -- CALLIE IDC --

01:24:23.558 --> 01:24:25.794
COULD IS A IS AN APPROACH TO

01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:29.397
HELPING TO COUNTERACT THE

01:24:29.464 --> 01:24:30.331
EFFECTS OF THIS FEDERAL ACTION.

01:24:30.398 --> 01:24:33.368
I'M TURNING NEXT -- TO THE NEXT

01:24:33.435 --> 01:24:35.703
PAGE THE HAND OUT.

01:24:35.770 --> 01:24:36.337
THE FINAL PLAN I WANNA MAKE IN

01:24:36.404 --> 01:24:37.739
TERMS OF THE CONSIDERATIONS HERE

01:24:37.806 --> 01:24:38.473

01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:39.073
SEE TO MORE WORKING IMMIGRANT

01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:40.175
FAMILIES ALSO MAKES SENSE

01:24:40.241 --> 01:24:42.143
BECAUSE CHILDREN.

01:24:42.210 --> 01:24:42.744
WHO GROW UP WITH AN IMMIGRANT

01:24:42.811 --> 01:24:44.345
PARENT I'M MORE THAN TWICE AS

01:24:44.412 --> 01:24:46.014
LIKELY TO BE GROWING UP IN

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:47.982
POVERTY IN CALIFORNIA AS

01:24:48.049 --> 01:24:48.550
CHILDREN WHO DO NOT HAVE AN

01:24:49.951 --> 01:24:50.985

01:24:51.052 --> 01:24:52.687
TERM OUTCOMES AND BETTER LONG

01:24:52.754 --> 01:24:53.922
TERM OUTCOMES IF THEY GROW UP

01:24:53.988 --> 01:24:55.857
WITH ECONOMIC SECURITY -- AND

01:24:55.924 --> 01:24:57.926
AGAIN THIS IS ALSO IMPORTANT --

01:24:57.992 --> 01:24:58.626
FOR THE WELL BEING OF THOSE

01:24:58.693 --> 01:25:01.095
CHILDREN AND BECAUSE IMMIGRANTS

01:25:01.162 --> 01:25:02.464
ALSO ARE SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART

01:25:02.530 --> 01:25:03.765
OF CALIFORNIA'S WORK FIRST THIS

01:25:03.832 --> 01:25:04.499
IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT.

01:25:04.566 --> 01:25:05.533
CONSIDERATION IN TERMS OF

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:08.770
INVESTING IN OUR FUTURE WORK

01:25:08.837 --> 01:25:11.206
FORCE AS WELL.

01:25:11.272 --> 01:25:13.475
SO AND FINALLY I WANT TO TURN --

01:25:13.541 --> 01:25:14.409

01:25:47.408 --> 01:25:49.177
ON A RELATIVELY CONSERVATIVE

01:25:49.244 --> 01:25:51.012
ESTIMATE OF TAKE UP AT I TEN

01:25:51.079 --> 01:25:52.080

AS FAR AS OUR GOVERNMENT IS

01:40:52.613 --> 01:40:54.548

01:45:18.145 --> 01:45:19.980
FEDERAL TAX LAW CHANGES IN TWO

01:45:25.018 --> 01:45:26.386
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CHANGED.

01:45:26.453 --> 01:45:27.487

WHAT WE'RE DOING SIMILAR TO WHAT

01:56:16.703 --> 01:56:17.970

EVEN EVEN MORE FOR MINOR CHANGES

IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THAT

01:58:45.184 --> 01:58:47.253
AND AND SEE WHAT SORT OF THINGS

01:58:47.320 --> 01:58:51.190

THAT THAT OF THAT SCORE HERE AS

02:03:45.484 --> 02:03:46.819
AS A AS AN EIGHTY MILLION DOLLAR

02:03:46.886 --> 02:03:50.422
REVENUE LOSS AND TWENTY TWENTY

02:03:50.489 --> 02:03:52.057
ONE ON THE REVENUE LOSS WOULD

WOULD -- A. B..

02:03:57.396 --> 02:03:58.564
IT ACTUALLY PROBABLY LESS THAN

02:03:58.631 --> 02:04:00.566
THAT BECAUSE THAT WAS THE SCORE

02:04:00.633 --> 02:04:01.200
THAT HAVE TO BE HAVE TO BE GAVE

02:04:01.267 --> 02:04:01.700

TYPE TO INVESTMENT TO THE

02:04:09.975 --> 02:04:12.978
PRIVATE ACTUALLY LESS INVESTMENT --

02:04:13.045 --> 02:04:13.913
YEAH I GET AND AND AND AND SO

02:04:13.979 --> 02:04:14.647
THERE'D BE THERE'D BE REVENUE

LOSSES FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND

02:04:16.415 --> 02:04:18.284
THEN IN TWENTY TWENTY SIX TO BE

02:04:18.350 --> 02:04:19.218
READ BIG REVENUE GAIN.

02:04:19.285 --> 02:04:20.452

OF THESE INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN

02:04:25.191 --> 02:04:26.659
HELD FOR TEN YEARS OR MORE

02:04:26.725 --> 02:04:26.959
[inaudible]

02:04:27.026 --> 02:04:30.462
SO -- MY LIMITED EXPERIENCE WITH

THIS IS THAT.

02:04:32.998 --> 02:04:36.869

02:04:40.606 --> 02:04:42.308
AND THE ENFORCEMENT OF THIS TO

02:04:42.374 --> 02:04:46.312
BE MEANINGFUL -- IT DOESN'T WORK

02:04:46.378 --> 02:04:48.547

BUT OF I'VE JUST SEEN SO MANY

02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:04.530
PROGRAMS WHERE THE TERMINOLOGY

02:05:04.597 --> 02:05:05.297
IS SO BROAD.

02:05:05.364 --> 02:05:07.066

INVESTMENT.

02:05:10.603 --> 02:05:12.938
THAT'S WORTHY OF US USING THAT

02:05:13.005 --> 02:05:13.572
REVENUE.

02:05:13.639 --> 02:05:14.640

OF THOSE OF THOSE ARE VERY

02:14:23.722 --> 02:14:24.689
UNCERTAIN REVENUES AND SO WE

02:14:24.756 --> 02:14:25.991
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE

02:14:26.057 --> 02:14:28.527
SUFFICIENT REVENUE. TO A POINT

02:14:28.593 --> 02:14:32.364
THAT OF DISCONNECTING IT -- I

02:14:32.431 --> 02:14:33.231
COULD I COULD SEE THAT IF WE

02:14:33.298 --> 02:14:35.167
IMPLEMENT THE EXPANSION OF THE

02:14:35.233 --> 02:14:37.569
I. T. C. THEN SOMETHING.

02:14:37.636 --> 02:14:39.037
WHAT THE REVENUE EXPECTED HERE

02:14:39.104 --> 02:14:40.739
THAT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WE GO

02:14:40.806 --> 02:14:43.909
BACK AND AND AND WE AND WE SAY

02:14:43.975 --> 02:14:45.544
THEIR LINK THE V. THE?

02:14:45.610 --> 02:14:46.445
THE ADOPTION WOULD BE LIKE IT'S

02:14:46.511 --> 02:14:48.713
WE WOULD NOT BE TRACKING IN FACT

02:14:48.780 --> 02:14:49.347
FOR SOME THESE ARE NOT IT WOULD

02:14:49.414 --> 02:14:50.582
NOT BE POSSIBLE TO REALLY TRACK

02:14:50.649 --> 02:14:51.850
IN REAL TIME.

02:14:51.917 --> 02:14:53.218
THE REVENUE RAISING THESE

02:14:53.285 --> 02:14:56.721
PROVISIONS SO IT WOULD JUST BE.

02:14:56.788 --> 02:14:57.889
ONE WORD WOULD BE DOING A A

02:14:57.956 --> 02:15:00.859
FORECAST OF OF HOW MUCH REVENUES

02:15:00.926 --> 02:15:02.260
CAN COME IN AND OUT OF WITH THE

02:15:02.327 --> 02:15:03.028
CONFORMING ITEMS.

02:15:03.094 --> 02:15:03.662
HOW MUCH REVENUE IS GOING TO BE

02:15:03.728 --> 02:15:05.297
GOING OUT WITH YOUR EXPAND

02:15:05.363 --> 02:15:06.565
EXPANDED IN CURRENT ARNED TAX

02:15:06.631 --> 02:15:07.899
CREDIT?

02:15:07.966 --> 02:15:11.603
AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:15:11.670 --> 02:15:15.006
THAT -- THAT THEIR CUT THAT IT'S

02:15:15.073 --> 02:15:16.641
BEING COVERED.

02:15:16.708 --> 02:15:17.309
YOU KNOW IN IN SUCH ONE

02:15:17.375 --> 02:15:18.477
DEPENDENT ON THE OTHER PROGRAM

02:15:18.543 --> 02:15:20.745
DISAPPEARS OR THE EXPANSION YEAH

02:15:20.812 --> 02:15:21.446
YES.

02:15:21.513 --> 02:15:23.081
THERE'S A LOT YEAH YEAH THAT

02:15:23.148 --> 02:15:24.483
WOULD BE TIED IN AND YOU KNOW.

02:15:24.549 --> 02:15:25.851
IN IN REALITY.

02:15:25.917 --> 02:15:26.418
THE WHEN THE NEXT RECESSION

02:15:26.485 --> 02:15:27.419
COMES.

02:15:27.486 --> 02:15:28.787
THAT THAT'S GONNA HURT RECENT

02:15:28.854 --> 02:15:29.588
REVENUES GOING TO GO DOWN

02:15:29.654 --> 02:15:30.255
REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE DO IS

02:15:30.322 --> 02:15:31.523
CONFORM AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

02:15:31.590 --> 02:15:33.058
EVALUATE A PRIORITIES.

02:15:33.124 --> 02:15:34.125
HOPEFULLY WE'VE GOT ENOUGH YOU

02:15:34.192 --> 02:15:37.863
KNOW IN IN RAINY DAY FUND. TO TO

02:15:37.929 --> 02:15:41.433
COVER THAT BUT BUT THE THE THE

02:15:41.500 --> 02:15:42.968
FLUCTUATIONS WE HAVE HERE.

02:15:43.034 --> 02:15:44.503
MOVE WOULD REALLY BE DWARFED BY

02:15:44.569 --> 02:15:46.505
WHAT WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE.

02:15:46.571 --> 02:15:47.272
ANY OF THE THE FLUCTUATION

02:15:47.339 --> 02:15:48.773
BETWEEN WHAT WE ACTUALLY GET

02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:50.308
FROM THESE PROVISIONS AND WHAT

02:15:50.375 --> 02:15:53.678
WE EXPECTED WITH BE TOWARD.

02:15:53.745 --> 02:15:54.479
BUT WHAT WE WOULD SEE AN A

02:15:54.546 --> 02:15:56.781
ECONOMIC DOWNTURN.

02:15:56.848 --> 02:15:57.749
THAT I'M SURE IF IT IF IT HELPS --

02:15:57.816 --> 02:15:58.383
THE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS IS

02:15:58.450 --> 02:16:00.452
PREDICATED ON BOTH OF THESE THE

02:16:00.519 --> 02:16:02.554
EXPANSION AND AND IS HAPPENING

02:16:02.621 --> 02:16:04.055
SO THEY THEY'VE LINK THEM.

02:16:04.122 --> 02:16:06.725
AND SO THAT'S I I BELIEVE HOW I

02:16:06.791 --> 02:16:07.325
UNDERSTAND THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:16:07.392 --> 02:16:08.059

02:16:09.561 --> 02:16:12.264
BOTH IN ORDER TO PAY FOR THE FOR

02:16:12.330 --> 02:16:13.765
THE I. T. C. BECAUSE A THIS

02:16:13.832 --> 02:16:14.499
ASSUME THAT IN THE REVENUE

02:16:14.566 --> 02:16:15.433
PROJECTIONS BOTH OF BOTH OF

02:16:15.500 --> 02:16:16.568
