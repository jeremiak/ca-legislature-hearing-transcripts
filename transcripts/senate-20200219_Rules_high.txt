AND THEN WE'LL GO RIGHT INTO QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS AFTER YOUR BRIEF COMMENTS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU WILLIAM PRESIDES- IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE RULES COMMITTEE AND STAFF- IT'S A TRUE HONOR. TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU- ON MY CONFIRMATION TO THE- BOARD OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE TEACHERS RETIREMENT SYSTEM MY BACKGROUND IS VERY GOOD- EDUCATED TO BE A LAWYER I PRACTICE LAW IN SAN FRANCISCO. FOR OVER TEN YEARS SUBSEQUENTLY RETURN TO MY NATIVE STATE WHICH IS NEVADA. WHERE I ULTIMATELY BEGAN TO ASSIST IN THE MANAGEMENT OF TWO LARGE FAMILY TRUSTS- I GAINED A BACKGROUND IN FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND SERVED ON NUMEROUS BOARDS OF DIRECTORS FOR FINANCIALLY RELATED ENTITIES. S WELL AS PUBLICLY TRADED AND REGULATED COMPANIES. HAVING BEEN APPOINTED ALMOST A YEAR AGO I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO SERVE FOR JUST OVER NINE MONTHS ON THE BOARD I FOUND IT TO BE BOTH CHALLENGING AND REWARDING. I'VE LEARNED HOW SKILLED AND TALENTED THE CAL STIRS STAFF YEARS. AND I'VE SEEN HOW COLLABORATIVELY THE BOARD WORKS AS WELL. SIMPLY STATED. CAL STARS IS A VALUE DRIVEN ORCHARD CORD ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO UPHOLD ITS DUTIES TO ITS MEMBERS AND TO PAY BENEFITS AS THEY COME DUE. I STRONGLY BELIEVE IN PUBLIC SERVICE WELL OUR DEMOCRACY CONFERS FREEDOMS IT ALSO COMES WITH RESPONSIBILITIES DEMOCRACY IS A PARTICIPATORY NOT A SPECTATOR SPORT THE VALUES OF THE IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC EDUCATION AND RESPECT FOR THOSE WHO PROVIDED IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE CLEARLY REFLECTED IN THE CARE IN SAFEGUARDING OF THE CAL STIRS FUND. I COMMITTEE YOU I WILL DO MY LEVEL BEST TO DO SO. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR MINING WANNA START WITH YOU THIS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. MR PERCENT LET ME OFFER MY CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU AND OUR APPRECIATION FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO SHARE YOUR EXPERTISE WITH. NOT ONLY THE TEACHERS OF CALIFORNIA BUT WITH ALL CALIFORNIANS WHO SUPPORT SUPPORTER TEACHERS IN THEIR EARNED RETIREMENT SADDAM WE HAD A GOOD CONVERSATION I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS BUT ONE THAT. I THINK WOULD BE OF INTEREST. TO OUR PANEL INTO OTHERS. IN YOUR FIDUCIARY ROLE WE HAVE INCREASING INTEREST IN LOOKING AT INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS AND HOW THEY MIGHT AFFECT OUR CLIMATE CRISIS- YOU SHARED SOME OF YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT SOME OF THE HISTORIC EVOLUTION. WOULD YOU MIND SHARING SOME OF THAT WITH OUR PANEL TODAY HAPPY TO SENATOR THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- CAL STIRS- I THINK HAS PROBABLY- ONE OF THE LONGEST. HISTORIES AS AN INSTITUTIONAL- INVESTOR IN ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUES- THEY'VE BEEN ENGAGING WITH VARIOUS COMPANIES- THEY'VE OF RECENTLY WE'VE ADOPTED A- TRANSITION PLAN TO A FOSSIL FREE ECONOMY- EACH OF THE ASSET CLASSES THAT. ARE MANAGED WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO OF NOW TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PLUS BILLION DOLLARS. AS AS AN ELEMENT OF ANALYSIS FOR A DETERMINATION WHETHER INVESTMENT HOULD BE MADE OR NOT. IS A CONSIDERATION OF. CLIMATE CHANGE AND ITS IMPACT ON THE INVESTMENT. BECAUSE WE'RE A LONG TERM INVESTOR BEING AN INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR WE DON'T HAVE TO LOOK AT THE NEW YEAR TERMS SO WE CAN PROJECT OUT YOU KNOW WHAT IMPACT A THE CLIMATE CHANGE WILL HAVE ON INVESTMENTS BUT AS A NEGATIVE IMPACT OVER TIME. IT WILL BE A CONSIDERATION IN THE DECISIONS MADE ON THAT INVESTMENT. BUT I WANT TO HASTEN TO ADD. THAT THE OVERRIDING BY DO SHERRY UT. OF MY FIGHT IS YOUR DUTY AS A AS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD IS TO MAKE SURE THAT BENEFITS ARE PAID TO OUR MEMBERS IN A TIMELY WAY IN SO THAT REALLY TAKES PRECEDENCE YOU KNOW OUR FIGHT TO SHERRY DUTIES MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE A FUNDED PLAN THEY CAN PAY. BENEFITS WHEN THEY COME DUE. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE AND ACTUALLY ONE OTHER QUESTION RELATING TO OUR DISCUSSION. WE PAY OUT TO FUND ADVISORS AND CONSULTANTS I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE ABOUT ONE POINT THREE BILLION A YEAR I THINK YOU'VE HAD SOME IDEAS IN THE BOARD ABOUT BRINGING SOME MORE OF THAT IN HOUSE COULD YOU JUST SHARE. A LITTLE OF THAT THINKING AND HAVE SOME OF THAT MONEY MIGHT BE. BETTER INVESTED. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR FOR THE QUESTION. WE FIRST START WITH THAT BENEFITS PAID TO OUR MEMBERS SIXTY PLUS PERCENT OF THAT COMES FROM INVESTMENT RETURNS. THESE ARE NAPA RETURNS NET OF FEES. WHILE 55% OF THE PORTFOLIO. THAT'S BETTER ACCESS TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS TODAY 55% OF IT IS MANAGED IN HOUSE WHEN IT WAS TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT BILLION THAT FIFTY FIVE PERCENT. COST US ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS APPROXIMATELY TO MANAGE THAT WAS THE COST OF INTERNALLY MANAGING. FOR THE OTHER 45% WHICH WAS MANAGED BY OUTSIDE MANAGERS IT WAS A BILLION EIGHT. NOW HAVING BEEN A PERSON WHO REALLY REVIEWED MANAGERS- WHEN I WAS WORKING FOR THESE FAMILY TRUST. I BEGAN TO SEE THE AT FEES THAT WERE CHARGED YOU KNOW THE TWO ONE TWENTIES THE 20% BEING THE FEES THAT ARE CALLED PROMOTES. THAT ADDS UP TO A LOT OF MONEY. SO IF WE'RE PAYING MEMBERS. AND WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH ANY CERTAINTY NO ONE CAN WHAT KIND OF RETURNS WERE GONNA GET WE CAN PREDICT OUR COSTS. IN TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN REDUCE OUR COSTS. THAT WILL BE A BENEFIT TO OUR MEMBERS. AN EVALUATION- WAS MADE- AND IT'S APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR WHICH IS A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE THAT WE SAVE BY INTERNALLY MANAGING. SO THAT'S THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IT GOES INTO THE POCKETS OF TEACHERS. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN INTERNALIZE MORE MANAGEMENT OF OUR PORTFOLIO. I THINK THAT THE TEACHERS AND ULTIMATELY YOU KNOW THE STATE ANOTHER YOU KNOW CONTRIBUTORS TO THE PENSION FUND. WILL BENEFIT SO I ARE I STRONGLY ONE OF THE REASONS I WANTED TO GO ON THIS BOARD WAS TO ADVOCATE THAT POSITION I THINK IT'S A VERY SMART POSITION EVERY DOLLAR YOU INVEST. TO HELP US INTERNALIZE THE MANAGEMENT WILL RETURN YOU MORE THAN TENFOLD. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN DO THAT I THINK WE'RE- BEING WISE AND PRUDENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AGAIN CONGRATULATIONS AND THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU CENTER BATES. THANK YOU WILL LET ME ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE OF I THINK THAT THE BOARD IS GOING TO BE WELL SERVED. LOOKING AT YOUR BACKGROUND MISTER RESIGNED CHEN YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SAID IN YOUR WRITTEN COMMENTS I DIDN'T TAKE NO TIME WE DIDN'T HAVE A FACE TO FACE. BUT OF OUR ONE OF THE COMMENTS THAT YOU PROVIDED IN YOUR WRITTEN RESPONSES THAT CASTERS FUNDING PLAN REMAINS ON TRACK. FOR FULL FUNDING BY TWENTY FORTY SIX I THINK THERE WERE SOME CONDITIONS TO THAT COULD YOU JUST ELABORATE ON. IT'S PRETTY HARD TO TELL THE WHOLE PLAN TO GET IF THE TWENTY FORTY SIX BUT WHAT IS THE MAYBE THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPONENTS. OF THAT CONTRACT TO GET IS THERE BY TWENTY FORTY SIX MILLION YOUR OB PROFESSIONAL- OF JUDGMENT. WELL I THINK I'VE ON ONE OF. LET YOU KNOW THAT I DON'T HAVE A PER. JOB ABOUT. THE PLAN I'VE ONLY BEEN THERE FOR NINE MONTHS BUT I WILL TRY TO GIVE YOU THE BEST ANSWER I CAN. BEING RELATIVELY NEW. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE- THE- AB I THINK WAS FOURTEEN SIXTY NINE THAT WAS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. DID IT PROVIDED FOR SOME FLEXIBILITY FORECASTERS TO ALLOCATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PAYING INTO THE FUND. AND YOU KNOW FROM FOR AGAIN FOR THE EMPLOYER THE EMPLOYEE AND THE STATE. AND SO THAT'S THAT 3240% DO YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE UP THAT THAT THAT THE THAT THE INVESTMENT RETURNS DON'T PROVIDE. SO THAT IS DETERMINED WHAT WE TRY TO DO IS THAT EVERY FIVE YEARS THERE'S AN ASSET LIABILITY MANAGEMENT PLAN THAT IS ADOPTED. AND THIS IS WHERE I'VE BEEN. I GOT AN EDUCATIONAL KERR POINT ON THERE BUT- BUT THE ACTUARIES DETERMINE WHAT OUR OBLIGATIONS WILL BE OVER TIME. AND THEN THEY WORK WITH THE INVESTMENT TEAM TO DETERMINE WHAT THE- RISK. A COMPONENT WILL BE RISK RETURN COMPONENT WILL BE AND SO THEN WE DO AN ASSET ALLOCATION THAT ASSET ALLOCATION ALSO PROVIDES FOR A DETERMINATION OF WHAT ARE PROJECTED RETURN WILL BE ARE PROJECTED RETURN IS 7% NOW PEOPLE SAYING THIS LOW RATE ENVIRONMENT HOW CAN YOU DO THAT WELL THIS IS LOOKED OUT OVER A PERIOD OF TIME TEN YEARS. AND IF HISTORY IS BROUGH THIS ANYTHING HAS PROVEN ANYTHING IS THAT THE LAST TEN YEARS WERE IN DOUBLE DIGIT RETURNS YOU KNOW OVER THE TEN YEARS. NOW THAT WAS A GREAT MARKET. SO I GUESS IS A LONG ANSWER BUT I I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP. PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE IS THAT. BASED ON THAT WE CAN DETERMINE THE IMPACT. THAT IT WILL HAVE ON THE CONTRIBUTORS TO THE PLAN. AND THAT'S IT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO PROJECT OUT WHAT OUR RETURNS WILL BE. SO THAT'S HOW WE DETERMINE HOW WE KEEP IN ON TRACK TO GET TO NINETEEN FORTY SIX. IT'S WITH ACTUARIES AND INVESTMENT TEAM WORKING TOGETHER ONE OF THE THING I'D LIKE TO ADD. BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND- AND MAYBE YOU DO BUT- I DIDN'T. AND THAT IS REALLY HOW COLLABORATIVELY. THE TEAM WORKS. AT CAL STARS. I MEAN IT IS IT IS REALLY TRULY REFRESHING BECAUSE I YOU KNOW WATCHING ASSET MANAGERS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. EVERY PORTFOLIO MANAGER THINKS HE OR SHE IS THE SMARTEST PERSON IN THE ROOM. BUT THERE IS THIS GREAT COLLABORATION AMONG- THEM THE PEOPLE THAT WORK AT CAL STIRS. AND I THINK IT'S A TESTIMONY TO THE LEADERSHIP THEY'RE- BOTH IN THE INVESTMENT SIDE IN ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE SIDE. IT'S BEEN TERRIFIC BECAUSE I I'VE SEEN LOTS OF INSTITUTIONS AND YOU KNOW COMPANIES THAT DON'T HAVE THIS VALUE DRIVEN LEADERSHIP. I APPRECIATE THAT AND I KNOW WAS KIND OF CALM. BUT HAVING SERVED ON ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND HEARING ABOUT THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY IN THE PROJECTIONS YOU JUST SHARED WITH ME ESSENTIALLY. ARE KINDA REMINDED ME I GUESS OF ALL OF THE DIFFERENT MOVING PARTS IN IT IS BASED ON PROJECTION AND PAST HISTORY. IN THE ON YOU KNOW OUR BALANCING THOSE TWO ON THE CONTINUE ON. SO THANK YOU LIKE I SAID- I THINK YOU BRING A GREAT PERSPECTIVE FROM THE OUTSIDE THE AND IN TALKING ABOUT THE COLLABORATION THAT GOES ON THERE. THAT SUBSTANTIAL ESSENTIAL TO I THINK DETERMINING RISK AND DETERMINING WHAT THE INVESTMENTS NEED TO BE SO. YOU WILL HAVE MY FULL SUPPORT- FOR YEAR- CONFIRMATION AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR STEPPING UP TO TAKE THAT. YEAH THANK YOU VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU MAYOR PRO TEM I JUST WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES I ACTUALLY ENJOYED OUR CONVERSATION AND LEARN- QUITE A BIT- IN TERMS OF AB FOURTEEN SIXTY NINE EVERYBODY AT THIS DíAS VOTED FOR IT SO IF YOU DON'T LIKE A YOU TO COME BACK TO US AT A LATER DATE NOT TELL US THAT TELLS OUT IT TELLS HOW TO FIX IT- OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED WERE THE ONES I WAS GONNA ASK- AGAIN I'M VERY COMFORTABLE. THE ONE THING THAT REALLY SHOW THROUGH WITH ME TODAY IS THAT I THINK OUR GREATEST PUBLIC SERVANTS OUR OUR TEACHERS AND YOUR PASSION IN MAKING SURE THAT WE DELIVER WHAT WE PROMISED REALLY KIND OF SHOWN THROUGH TODAY WHICH I APPRECIATE LOOKING FOR DAY ANYTHING I CAN DO TO HELP YOU LET ME KNOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH RELATIONS THANK YOU. KEY CENTER. THANK YOU MAY PRO TEM UM. YOU KNOW I THINK WE ALL WANT TO LOOK. IN TO. SERVICES AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO REALLY- I WAS JUST CURIOUS WHAT THE RATIONALE. WAS OR IS FOR THE- OUTSIDE VERSUS INSIDE ASSET MANAGEMENT SPLIT THAT YOU REFERRED 255405% AND WHAT AND WHETHER RISK MANAGEMENT- ASSET DIVERSIFICATION PLAYS ANY ROLE PLAYED ANY ROLE IN THAT DETERMINATION. JENNIFER QUESTION OR TWO GAS AND YET THEY'RE THEY'RE PROBABLY- I'LL BREAK IT DOWN INTO TWO PARTS IF I MAY. THE FIRST PART IS WHEN YOU HAVE A PORTFOLIO- AS LARGE AS THIS OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO- SPREAD YOUR RISK. IN THE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT YOU KNOW IS DIFFERENT BUCKETS OF ASSETS THAT YOU TO INVEST IN SO THAT IF FOR EXAMPLE EQUITIES ARE IN THE TANK MAY BE FIXED INCOME AND INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS ARE DOING WELL YOU KNOW OR OR AT LEAST HOLDING THEIR OWN. SO THAT IS WHY YOU HAVE YOU KNOW THE DIVERSITY OF INVESTMENTS IS TO PROTECT YOURSELF AGAINST- RISK- WITH REGARD TO ASSETS BEING MANAGED INTERNALLY AS OPPOSED TO EXTERNALLY THE KISS STORY PLEA- CAL STIRS AS I UNDERSTAND IT- WAS ALL EXTERNALLY MANAGEMENT I THINK MANY PENSION FUNDS HERE IN THE STATES WERE ALL EXTERNALLY MANAGE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. I THINK THAT THAT WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT- THERE WAS A RECOGNITION. THAT OTHER LARGE INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS WERE. GETTING BETTER RETURNS NET RETURNS BY BRINGING THOSE MANAGEMENT SERVICES IN HOUSE. AND I THINK PROBABLY THE GROWTH OF INDEXED EQUITY INVESTING WHICH MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT EASIER YOU DON'T HAVE STOCK PICKERS YOU HAVE YOU KNOW INDEX FUNDS THAT YOU INVESTED. I THINK THAT PROBABLY ASSISTED IN IN IN MOVING IT UP MORE QUICKLY. THE THERE'S IN CANADA FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE MANY PENSION FUNDS WHICH IN BASICALLY HAVE ALL OF THE MANAGEMENT OF THE FUNDS AN INTERNAL. AND I THINK THAT THAT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS- THAT WE ULTIMATELY FACE IN DOING THAT- HERE IN IN IN IN THE STATE'S IN CALIFORNIA. IS THAT WORSE WE HAVE- AN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND. AND PENSION BENEFITS COMPANY TO TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF COMPANIS AND CAL STAR SO YOU KNOW WE MANAGE IT WE INVESTMENT MANAGE AND WE ALSO PAY PENSION BENEFITS SO WE'VE GOT REALLY PRIVATE KINDS OF BUSINESSES WE RUN BUT SUBJECT TO A LOT OF THE STATE REGULATORY YOU KNOW EMPLOYMENT- YOU KNOW BURKE LOS. AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN WE'VE BEEN MOVING- TOWARD. INTERNALIZING AS MUCH AS WE CAN AND SO I HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT AS TIME GOES ON. YOU KNOW WE WERE GONNA PROBABLY NEED TO HAVE- MORE FREEDOM IN HIRING PEOPLE THAT WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW THE CIVIL SERVICE REQUIREMENTS NOW I SAY THAT. NOT KNOWING ENOUGH REALLY BUT I KNOW THAT IT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE WANT TO MANAGE INTERNALLY A LOT OF ASSETS- WE'RE GONNA NEED YOU KNOW OF A WE NEED TO HIRE GOOD PEOPLE AND GOOD PEOPLE ON THE OUTSIDE. MAKE A LOT MORE MONEY AND THAT'S GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE. I WAS GOING TO ASK IF THERE WERE STATUTORY OR REGULATORY IMPEDIMENTS TO MOVING. AWAY FROM THE FIFTY FIVE FORTY FIVE SPLIT IN TERMS OF OUTSIDE VERSUS INSIDE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND IF SO WHAT THOSE ARE I SUPPOSE WE COULD SAY THAT FOR ANOTHER DAY AND ANOTHER CONVERSATION WELL AND- AND HOPEFULLY SOMEBODY THAT'S BETTER INFORMED AND I BECAUSE- AT THIS POINT IN TIME I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH TO ENGAGE IN THAT CONVERSATION BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT I IN ANYTHING YOU CAN. HELP DO THAT. I THINK THAT IS WELL INVESTED MONEY. WELL I WILL SAY THAT YOU'RE NOT ALONE I MEAN AS I RECALL WE HAVE THE SAME. WHENEVER THE STATE- ENGAGES IN OPERATIONS CENTER. OF EXACTLY THE SAME REQUIRED SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE COMMERCIAL SIDE ENGAGES AND WE HAVE A PROBLEM AND- WE HAVE THE SAME SITUATION OR SOMETHING SIMILAR IN THE INSURANCE. BUSINESS WHEN WHERE WITH THE STATE FUND AND OUR WORKERS ARE ARE FORAY INTO THE WORKERS COMPENSATION FIELD AS WELL IN TERMS OF. PAYING PEOPLE ENOUGH MONEY TO COME IN AND HELP US MANAGE AN OPERATION THAT WOULD GARNER MUCH MORE. MONEY IN THE OUTSIDE IN THE COMMERCIAL- COMMERCIAL SIDE OF THINGS SO LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING WITH YOU- CONGRATULATIONS AFFORD TO SUPPORTING AND MOVING YOUR CUT- A CONFIRMATION OF THE PERFECT POINT AFTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR I APPRECIATED. THANK YOU SENATOR I JUST HAVE ONE AREA AND- I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSES ON A NUMBER OF THESE ISSUES PARTICULARLY THE COST SIDE. OF BECAUSE FOR SO MANY OF US- IT IS NOT THE WORLD WE LIVE IN BUT WE GET HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE SYSTEMS AND IT'S CERTAINLY. FRONT CENTER OF EVERYONE'S MIND SO PARTICULARLY THE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS ARE RELATED TO OPERATIONS AND COST AND HOW TO SAVE MONEY I APPRECIATE. LAST JUNE CAL STIRS IN CALPERS PARTNER TO HOSTED DIVERSITY FORUM. AND OF COURSE AREAS INCLUDED THINGS LIKE WOMEN AND MINORITIES IN CORPORATE BOARDS INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FIRMS EXAMINING UNCONSCIOUS BIAS- OF A SEX INCLUSION. BEST PRACTICES FOR INCLUSIVE CULTURES WHAT I WOULD ASK IS WHAT ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO BUILD AN INCLUSIVE CULTURE. IN THE INVESTMENT WORLD I MEAN WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE LEGISLATED THINGS BUT I'M JUST CURIOUS FROM YOUR HISTORY EXPERIENCE. HOW DO YOU RECOMMEND ADDRESS AND ISSUES LIKE THAT WITH IN AND INVESTMENT SYSTEM. WELL THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION THANK YOU SENATOR- I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO- ASK SOMEONE TO DO SOMETHING IF YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT YOURSELF. IT'S PRETTY HARD TO MAKE THAT ASK AND I CAN TELL YOU WITH ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY BECAUSE I'M I'M THERE ARE AT CAL STIRS. THAT A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF OUR PORTFOLIO MANAGERS ARE WOMEN. AND SO- CAL STIRS NOT ONLY TALKS THE TALK THROUGH ENGAGEMENT WITH THESE COMPANIES IT WALKS THE WALK. AND SO I THINK YOU SEVEN EXAMPLE WHEN YOU WHEN YOU'RE A LARGE INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR. AND YOU CAN POINT TO YOUR ARE MANY WOMEN THERE THE WOMAN WHO THE GLOBAL EQUITY SWITCHES FORTY SOME ODD PERCENT OF THE TOTAL PORTFOLIO. IF PORTFOLIO MANAGER THAT THAT ASSET CLASS IS A WOMAN. PRIVATE EQUITIES A WOMAN SO- THAT'S NUMBER ONE YOU HAVE TO LEAD BY EXAMPLE TWO I KNOW THAT WE ENGAGE FOR WE MAKE ANY DETERMINATION. WITH A MANAGER TO DETERMINE THAT AND I KNOW THAT IT IS JUST BECAUSE OF THE LEADERSHIP OF THE OF CASTERS IT'S IN VERY VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. BUT AGAIN I THINK YOU START WITH LEAD BY EXAMPLE ENGAGE SO THAT YOU HAVE CREDIBILITY WHEN YOU ENGAGE YOU CAN TURN AROUND AT THE FOR THE PERSON YOU'RE TALKING TO AND SAY WE'D BE HAPPY TO INVEST WITH YOU BOUGHT. YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE WHAT WE NEED WHICH IS MORE DIVERSITY. SO ANYWAY I DON'T KNOW IF THAT ANSWERS THE QUESTION IT DOES LOUIS IT LET ME ASK- OBVIOUSLY IT'S INTENTIONAL. I AM IN DIVERSITY DOESN'T JUST HAPPEN IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM IT'S INTENTIONAL WHETHER WE'RE TALKIN REGIONAL DIVERSITY INVESTMENT THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF DIVERSITY. BUT I IT'S INTENTIONAL. IT IS I DID DID DO YOU FIND THAT OF SOME OTHER FEEDBACK I'VE GOTTEN IS YOU WILL NOT GET THE QUALITY OF SERVICE THAT YOU NEED AND SO I JUST WANT TO ON THE RECORD HERE YOU SAY HOPEFULLY THAT YOU OR YOUR BORDERS ABLE TO FIND THE QUALITY YOU NEED AND MEET THOSE INTENTIONAL KIND OF GOALS FOR THE SYSTEM I BELIEVE THAT TO BE TRUE BUT I CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR MY OWN EXPERIENCE SO YOU HAVE GOOD EXPERIENCE FROM THE RESUME THAT I'M LOOKING AT. FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE- I CHAIRED IN NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE BOARD- POSITION WHERE I RAN THE GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE WHEN I CAME ON THAT BOARD THERE WERE NO WOMEN ON THE BOARD THAT WASN'T THE LARGEST COMPANY WAS IT THERE WAS A READ INVESTED IN HOTELS OWNED HOTELS. AND I SAID YOU KNOW WE REALLY DO NEED TO YOU KNOW HAVE. YOU MORE DIVERSITY ON THIS BOARD AND- WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY WE- WE GOT A WOMAN ON THE BOARD WHO TURNED OUT TO BE END UP BEING THE VICE CHAIR OF THE BOARD WHO IS-PROBABLY THE MOST- AFFECTED BOARD MEMBER THAT I WORKED WITH SHE AND SO I THINK THAT. FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE I SEE IT AS A NO BRAINER I MEAN YOU JUST YOU YOU KNOW YOU FIND TALENT AND IN THIS DAY AND AGE AND I THINK BECAUSE OF. YOU KNOW THIS BATTLE HAS BEEN. FOR WOMEN IS BEING HAS BEEN FOUGHT FOR A LONG TIME NOW. AND I THINK THE BENEFITS OF THIS YOU KNOW YOU'RE SEEING IT IN THE WORK FORCE THROUGHOUT THE WORK FORCE TODAY. I THINK YOU SEE MORE AND MORE TALENTED. WELL EDUCATED EXPERIENCE WOMEN. THAT YOU CAN DRAW FROM. AND TO ME I WOULD. YOU KNOW MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN. I LIKE WORKING ON BOARDS THAT ARE COLLABORATIVE MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT THERE IS MORE COLLABORATION WITH A WOMAN BOARD MEMBER THEN OFTENTIMES WITH SOME MEN BACK MORTARBOARD MEMBERS THEY'RE MUCH MORE WILLING TO COLLABORATE- AND I-THINK YOU'RE MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE. WHEN YOU HAVE A BOARD THAT'S WILLING TO WORK TOGETHER AND NOT SACRIFICE THE SUCCESS OF THE GOALS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IS THAT FINANCIALLY. EXACTLY I APPRECIATE THAT I THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS- IF NOTHING ELSE I WILL GO TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO ARE HERE IN SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION. LET ME CALL UP FIRST THOSE THAT MIGHT BE HERE IN SUPPORT- WE HAVE A MIKE ANA. THAT THAT COULD BE VERY GOOD SIGN- BOB BYE SO MY NEXT QUESTION IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN OPPOSITION. OBVIOUSLY IT'S A GOOD SIGN. THANK YOU SENATOR ROTH HAS MOVED YOUR CONFIRMATION MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL SENATORS BATES BATES AYE MONNING MONNING AYE ROSS ROSS I WILL WILK AYE ATKINS HI A CONCISE CONGRATULATIONS AND THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE. LET ME SEE I'D CALL MR BROUGHT FORWARD MEMBER OF THE AGRICULTURAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD WELCOME. THANK YOU. LET ME INVITE YOU TO OF COURSE OPENING COMMENTS THANK ANYONE YOU WOULD LIKE THIS WITH YOU AND THEN WE'LL GO RIGHT INTO IT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- WELL LET ME INTRODUCE MY FAMILY THAT'S HERE. MY MOM TV RASCON. WELCOME MY SON MATTY BROAD OR MATT PRIDE AS YOU KNOW HIM. BY AND MY WIFE IT'S OBVIOUSLY A HUGE PRIVILEGE FOR ME TO BE HERE TO HAVE BEEN APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR TO THIS POSITION IT'S SOMETHING OF A DREAM COME TRUE FOR ME THIS JOB- AND- AND- IT'S INCREDIBLY ENJOYABLE IT IT'S A HUGE PRIVILEGE TO ENGAGE IN THIS PUBLIC SERVICE I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF PRELIMINARY POINTS THAT I'D LIKE TO MAKE ABOUT THINGS THAT I'D LIKE TO ACCOMPLISH WHILE LINE ON THIS BOARD. I OF. I WOULD LIKE TO HELP EXPAND ARE OUT OF REACH IN THE- COMMUNITY THAT WE SERVE NOT ONLY A FARMWORKERS BY. THE GROWERS AS WELL ON WE DO A GOOD JOB DOING IT WITH THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE A SMALL AGENCY THERE'S ONLY SIXTY EMPLOYEES AND WE DO IT AS BEST WE CAN AND I THINK WE DO A GOOD JOB. I THINK THE BOARD ITSELF ESPECIALLY IF WE GET. NEW APPOINTEES OR MORE APPOINTEE'S I THINK THAT WE NEED TO PARTICIPATE. IN THAT PROCESS AS WELL. ON MEETING WITH LABOR MEETING WITH BUSINESS MEETING WITH COMMUNITY GROUPS. ON COULD TO HELP- EDUCATE THE PUBLIC. OUR STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT WHAT WE DO AND JUST SORT OF WHO WE ARE WHICH KIND OF LEADS TO MY SECOND POINT- IN A MORE CHALLENGING THING. I THIS BOARD- IS A BOARD IN WHICH OF BOTH THE LABOR SIDE IN THE MANAGEMENT SIDE AND I'VE MET WITH BLOW OFF. ARE DISSATISFIED. ON MUCH OF THE TIME AND FRUSTRATED AND- YOU KNOW IT'S SORT OF AN OLD WE SAY IT ALL THE TIME WELL EVERYBODY'S ON HAPPY YOU MUST BE DOING SOMETHING RIGHT BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IF EVERYBODY'S ON HAPPY PROBABLY THINGS CAN BE IMPROVED NOW YOU CAN'T IMPROVE THE FACT THAT THIS IS AN ADVERSARIAL- UP A BOARD THAT DEALS WITH RESOLVING. ISSUES BETWEEN ADVERSARIES IT IS NOT YOU KNOW- BUT THAT KIND OF A FEEL GOOD INSTITUTION IT'S LIKE A COURT IT IS A COURT AND EIGHT ADJUDICATES CLAIMS SO WE CAN'T SUGARCOAT THAT. WHAT ON FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF LABOR THESE CASES ARE LITIGATED IN LITIGATED IN LITIGATED FOR EVER WHICH SORT OF UNDERMINES THINGS EVEN IF YOU WIN AND FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE EMPLOYERS THEY FEEL FRANKLY THAT THEY NEVER WITH. AND SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN ALL THAT LIES THE TRUTH BUT WHAT WE CAN DO. IS TO TRY TO WORK REALLY HARD AND THIS GOS BACK TO MY FIRST POINT ABOUT. BEING OUT THERE WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE THEM FEEL SOME CONFIDENCE THAT WHETHER THEY WIN OR LOSE AND NOBODY'S ENTITLED TO WIN AND YOU KNOW EVERY TIME OR LOSE EVERY TIME OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT- BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY NGUYEN IN THEY LOSE. THEY WENT IN THEY LOSE BECAUSE THE PROCESS WAS FAIR AND IMPARTIAL. AND THAT THEY HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THEY'RE BEING HEARD AND NOT BEING DISMISSED AND THAT'S A TALL ORDER- BUT I'D LIKE TO USE MY TIME ON THIS BOARD TO TRY TO MOVE THAT NOTION FORWARD. SO THAT THIS BOARD BECOMES A LITTLE LESS OF AN AREA IN WHICH ON ALL SIDES FEEL AGGRIEVED AND MAYBE ALL SIDES FEEL MOVED TOWARDS YEAH YOU KNOW I DON'T ALWAYS WIN BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S FAIR. SO WITH THAT I AM PREPARED TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU CENTER ROTH A MAN PRO TEM- ACTUALLY. I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FIRST I WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU SIR FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO STEP UP AND SERVE IT HASN'T BEEN THAT MANY YEARS AGO- SINCE I'VE BEEN UP HERE WHEN WE HAD A HEARING IN A DIFFERENT SETTING ON A DIFFERENT ISSUE. HAVING TO DO WITH THE AGRICULTURAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD WHERE. YOU KNOW I CAME OUT OF THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD NOT TOO LONG AFTER THIS ONE WAS-CREATED. AND I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS OF THE BOARD REPRESENTATIVE IN FRONT OF ME HAVING TO DO WITH THE- AVERAGE CASELOAD PER ATTORNEY AND- FIELD EXAMINER FIELD AGENTS AND THE RESPONSE I GOT WAS I DON'T KNOW. WHICH WAS NOT TOTALLY SATISFACTORY TO ME SO. I'M SURE THINGS HAVE CHANGED SINCE THE DATE AND I CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD TO OF. YOUR SERVICE ON THE BOARD- THE INJECTION OF NEW AND SUSIE AS A MAN VISION. AND MISSION FOR THE BOARD AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING FOR THE CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU ON THE SUBJECTS SO. WITH THAT AGAIN CONGRATULATIONS MAN APPROACHED HIM I LOOK FORWARD TO WIN MAKING THE MOTION TO CONFIRM AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU MAYOR PRO TEM I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS EITHER OBVIOUSLY HERE LONG STAND STANDING CAPITAL FIGURE WITH AN EXCELLENT REPUTATION LITTLE DISAPPOINTED YOU DIDN'T BRING YOUR DOGS AS A DOG PERSON SHOULD DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET IT HOW MANY FOR VOTE YOU CAN GET BUT- WITH THAT WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU AND I'M SURE YOU'RE GOING TO BE A VIBRANT VOICE ON THAT BOARD. THANK YOU. YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO NOT BRING IN YOUR DOGS. I AM HAPPY TO MEET YOU AT ANY TIME AND- DEAL WITH THE DOG ISSUES YES. WHEN I BRING MY DOG YES WHAT WILL START A DOG WILL START A DOG PARK. THERE YOU GO I'M ALL IN FAVOR SENATOR BATES. WELL THANK YOU MISTER RODHAM IN A CAR YOU BURY FLY LINE DO A VERY LONG LONG TIME- FOR SO THANK YOU THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE RESUME OF SERVICE- IN IN THE- WORK OF THE PUBLIC SO OF REMARKABLE IN TERMS OF THE YEARS THAT YOU'VE SERVED- I STILL NEED TO DO SOME OUT REACHING MY DISTRICT ON ON THE QUESTIONS SO I WILL BE OF STAINING TODAY BUT IT IS NOT TO BE TAKEN AS SOMETHING THAT. DOESN'T REALLY SALUTE YOU AND I KNOW THAT YOU ARE WILL BE A GREAT SERVICE TO THIS BOARD I THINK IT MIGHT BE IMPORTANT JUST FOR THE GENERAL CONVERSATION TO- I ASKED THE QUESTION ARE SINCE. THE OF COMPLAINTS THAT COME TO YOU REALLY YOU SERVE AS AN APPEALS BOARD ESSENTIALLY BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY BEEN OFFICIALLY ESTABLISHED I THINK YOU USE THE TERM OR THE AMOUNT NINETY SEVEN PERCENT. AND THE QUESTION I ASKED AND DO WE REALLY NEED THE BOARD AND YOU MADE IT VERY CLEAR WHY THE LITTLE IN THIS MORNING SO IMPORTANT IN THAT PROCESS AND IF YOU'D SHARE THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT FOR. YOU VERY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT OUT TO YOU THE ROLE IN THE DEFLATE THE PROPER COULD PROCESS TORIO. BOARDS ARE THAT HAS THAT AUTHORITY RIGHT WAS SOMETHING I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANY RIGHT ONE NIGHT I WANT I WAS MAKING WITH THE WHICH I'M I'M HAPPY TO SHARE. IS THAT BECAUSE WE ARE A PROSECUTORIAL BOARD THAT OUR GENERAL COUNSEL MAKES A DECISION ABOUT WHETHER THEY'RE SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE CHARGE. WHICH IS CONTRASTED WITH AND ONE PROSECUTORIAL BOARD WHITE THE PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS BOARD IS AN EXAMPLE. ANY PARTY COULD BRING A CHARGE THE CHARGE MOVES FORWARD OF THAT. WANT TO MOVE IT FORWARD. THERE THERE. CURRENT NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THEIR CASE FOR BUT THE ESSENTIAL SOMEONE WHO BRINGS. A CHARGES LIKE SOMEONE BRING FOR INFORMATION TO DISTRICT ATTORNEY THE DISH TURN MAKES IT IS WHERE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE K. SO THAT EVERY TIME THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY MAKES A DECISION OR IN OUR CASE THE GENERAL COUNSEL MAKES A DECISION WHETHER ISN'T SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO MOVE FORWARD I DON'T THINK THIS IS A STRONG ENOUGH CASE AND I'M NOT GOING TO MOVE THE PROCESS FORWARD THAT IS SORT OF A WIN FOR THE EMPLOYER IF THE EMPLOYER IS THE ENTITY CHARGED- FOR WOULD BE CHARGED. SO WE DON'T THAT DOESN'T SHOW UP IN STATISTICS IF YOU WELL SO A LOT OF WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT AS THE PROCESS MOVES FORWARD IT MOVES FORWARD MOSTLY- AGAINST EMPLOYERS THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GENERALLY CHARGED ON IN ALL OF THESE LABOR LAW SYSTEMS AND THE IT'S HEARD BY- ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE AND THEREFORE MOST OF THE CASES THT WE- HEARD HAVE GONE THROUGH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DUE PROCESS BEFORE THEY GET TO US WE'RE LIKE THE COURT OF APPEALS SO WE'RE LOOKING AT VERY DISTILLED. IN ISSUES THE POWER. A LINE WE'RE NOT REVIEWING THE WHOLE THING OVER AGAIN AND SO BY THE TIME IT GETS TO US IT'S A MUCH MORE DISTILLED. FACT SITUATION. OBVIOUSLY SOMEBODY NEEDS TO. RESOLVE THOSE DISPUTES BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE PARTIES BUT IT ALSO SHOULDN'T. SURPRISE PEOPLE ON THE THAT MOST OF THOSE CASES IF MOST OF THOSE CASES GO IN FAVOR OF- OF THE ARM. OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL'S POSITION PURSUING A CHARGE THAT WOULD NOT BE UNUSUAL IT'S NOT AN UNFAIR PROCESS IF IT'S NOT A FIFTY FIFTY THING. IN FRONT OF OUR BOARD ANY MORE THAN WE WOULD THEN WE WOULD THINK THAT THAT ON THAT A DISTRICT ATTORNEY THAT NGUYEN YOU KNOW WHO LOSES GOOD JOB OR THAT THE PROCESS IS FAIR THAT'S PROBABLY A DISTRICT ATTORNEY WHO'S- CHARGED CASES THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN CHARGED. SO WOULD WE WOULD EXPECT THAT THE PROSECUTION WINS MORE CASES AND THAT DOESN'T MAKE THE PROCESS INHERENTLY UNFAIR IT FITS WORKING RIGHT THAT'S HOW IT SHOULD BE THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE PEOPLE DON'T PUT UP A VIGOROUS DEFENSE AND ATE A WIN BUT IF YOU CAN'T AUTOMATICALLY DRAW A CONCLUSION THAT THE PROCESSES ON IS BIASED AROUND FARE- BOMB FOR THAT REASON. AND THE AND THAT'S THE CASE WITH US SO THAT WAS THE POINT I WAS TRYING TO THE IT WAS VERY GOOD BECAUSE PERCEPTION BECOMES REALITY IN SOME OF THESE ISSUES WE HAVE LAWS LABOR BOARD SO I APPRECIATED THAT.

I CURRENTLY OVERSEE INCARCERATED POPULATION OF APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE THOUSAND ADULTS AND WORKFORCE OF OVER THIRTY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES AS THE DIRECTOR IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE WE ARE OPERATING SAFE AND HUMANE PRESENCE CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT OF HEALTH FOR THOSE WHO WORK AND LIVE WITH DAN I HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES DORN WITHIN THIS AGENCY DURING MY TIME AT THOSE CHANGES HAVE RESULTED AND SAFER PRISONS ENVIRONMENT MORE CONDUCIVE TO REHABILITATION. ADDITIONALLY WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE WITH THE EXPANSION A REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING AND A GREATER NUMBER OF LIFE TERM OFFENDERS BEING FOUND SUITABLE FOR PAROLE I SEE THAT THE POPULATION HAS A NEW SENSE OF HOPE. CDC ARE CURRENTLY NOW. ONSITE CLASSES AT THIRTY FOUR THIRTY FIVE OR PRESENCE. AND OVER THELASTTWO YEARS WE'VE- TRIPLED OUR SELF HELP PROGRAMS AVAILABLE. THE DEPARTMENT ALSO CONTINUES TO INVEST IN ITS EMPLOYEES THIS INCLUDES EXPANDING TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES TO INCLUDE AND HAS LEADERSHIP COURSES TO DEVELOP A COMPETENT AND DIVERSE WORKFORCE. WHILE ALSO PROVIDING RESOURCES FOR STAFF TO DEAL WITH STRESS RESILIENCE. THESE EFFORTS ARE IMPORTANT STEPS TO WILL HELP POSITION IS DEPARTMENT FOR FUTURE SUCCESS. DESPITE THESE CHANGES THE DEPARTMENT STILL FACES MANY CHALLENGES. THE A DISRUPTION FROM PRISON GANGS TO COP CONTINUED INTRODUCTION OF CONTRABAND INTO OUR PRESENCE. AS WELL AS ENSURING THAT OUR STAFF UNDERSTAND THEIR ROLE IN ADVOCATING FOR THE OFFENDER'S REHABILITATION. I WANT FOR A STAFF TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE JOB THAT THEY DO THAT THEY'RE MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES AND IN THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. ALLOW MYSELF ALONG WITH OTHER CITY SEE OUR EXECUTIVES RECENTLY WENT TO NORWAY TO OBSERVE THE CORRECTIONAL SAID SYSTEM. AND I MUST ADMIT I CAME BACK TRULY INSPIRED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF CHANGE OF HOW WE CAN CONTINUE TO IMPROVE AS I SAW A SYSTEM THAT WAS TRULY BASED ON HUMANITY WHAT INSURANCE STAFF AN OFFENDER SAFETY. I AM COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS THE MANY COMPLEX PROBLEMS AT THIS AGENCY FACES. I AM EXCITED AND HUMBLE TO LEAD THE DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS DURING THESE TIMES. WE ARE AT THE TIME WERE WILL CHANGE CAN OCCUR BECAUSE AS I TALK TO STAFF MANY ARE OPEN TO THE IDEA. THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO DO THINGS BETTER WHICH IN THE END MAKES IT ALL. THE BENEFITS OF SAW. IS MY HONOR TO SERVICE THE DIRECTOR AND I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR MONEY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. WELCOME TRACTOR GIPSON I ALSO WANT TO WELCOME SECRETARY DS WHO I SEE IS IN YOUR FAN CLUB HERE TODAY. WELCOME SECRETARY. I WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON NOT ONLY DISAPPOINTMENT BUT YEAR YEARS OF SERVICE TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA- WE HAD A REALLY GREAT CONVERSATION FROM MY POINT OF VIEW IN TERMS OF EDUCATING THE FOR THEIR- I KNOW MANY IN IN THE LEGISLATURE IN IN OUR COMMUNITY SHARE CONCERN. AROUND THE CONTRABAND ISSUE IN MAYBE YOU CAN YOU SHARE WITH ME ONE PILOT PROGRAM GOING ON AND- IF YOU COULD JUST SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT'S APPROACH ON CONTRABAND IN PARTICULARLY WITH CONCERN. SOME OF THAT BROUGHT IN BY STAFF WERE GUARDS. I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO SENATOR THANK YOU CURRENTLY THE DEPARTMENT WE RECOGNIZE WE HAVE A CONTRABAND PROBLEM CELL PHONES AND DRESS COMING INTO OUR PRISONS WHICH ARE VERY DISRUPTIVE. AND SO CURRENTLY DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN FUNDED FOR A PILOT PROGRAM AT THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT FACILITY WHERE WE'RE REALLY USING A MULTI LAYERED APPROACH TO TRY TO IN A DAY CONTRABAND. IS INCLUDES OF CANINES WHO ARE DOING VEHICLE SEARCHES ON. VEHICLES WILL COME IN FOR STAFF EMPLOYEES VISITORS VOLUNTEERS. AS WELL AS THE USE OF AND I'LL SAY IS. GOES INSIDE OF THE SECURE PERIMETER IS PROCESS THROUGH AS WELL AS THE USE OF BAGGAGE AND PARCEL SCANNERS TO. SCAN AND- ANYTHING THAT STAFF OR VISITORS ARE BRINGING IT TO THE PRESIDENT TO TRY TO MITIGATE- CONTRABAND. WE RECOGNIZE TO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO DO MORE AND SO WE ARE CONTINUALLY LOOKING AROUND FOR BEST PRACTICES LOOK AT WHAT OTHER DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS DO. I SHARE WITH YOU SENATOR THAT ONE OF THINGS I SAW- HAVING TOURED ORGAN PAVILION IN NORWAY. IS THE VERY IN DEPTH WAY THAT STAFF RESEARCH BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT. STAFF ARE PART OF OUR PROBLEM AS IT RELATES TO BRING IN CONTRABAND UNFORTUNATELY THEY BECOME COMPROMISED BY THE OFFENDER. AND AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT MRS EVERYBODY SAFETY WE HAVE A COMPROMISED EMPLOYEE. AND SO DEPARTMENT CONTINUES EXPLORE AVENUES AS TO HOW DO WE CONTINUE TO ONE IDENTIFY ALL THE POINTS OF ENTRY OF CONTRABAND COME INTO OUR SYSTEM. AND THEN HOW DO WE LOOK TO MITIGATE THAT AND THEN ELIMINATED. BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT OUR PRESENCE OR SAY. THANK YOU AND I. THINK YOU DID UNDER SCORE THAT. AT THE CORE IS THE SAFETY OF GUARDS AND OTHER STAFF THEY CAN BE THE VICTIMS OF. CONTRABAND YOU SHARE THE PILOT PROJECT IN INTEREST I'M GLAD THAT IT'S HAPPENING BUT- WHAT WOULD IT TAKE FOR THAT TO BE THE NORM AT ALL OF THE INSTITUTIONS WHAT CURRENTLY SERVE A PILOT PROGRAM IS UNDER REVIEW BY- YOU CAL STATE FRESNO IS THE RESEARCH INTO THE THAT'S DOING THE RESEARCH ON THE- PILOT AND WE HOPE THAT IT WILL NOTICE A RESULT OR AT LEAST LEADERS TO WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T WORK. BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT YES WE HAVE A VERY MULTI LAYERED APPROACH AT ONE PRESENT WE GOT THIRTY FOR THE PRESENCE THAT ALTHOUGH ALL. AND WHAT WE WANT TO HAVE A SYSTEM APPROACH AND WE'VE HAD INTERNAL MEETINGS WITHIN CITY SEE OUR TO REALLY LOOK AT OUR OPERATIONS AND TRY TO AS I SAID IDENTIFIED THE AVENUES POINTS OF ENTRY THAT THE COMMAND AND IS. MULTIPLE WAYS UNFORTUNATELY NOT ONLY STAFF VISITORS BUT ALSO- BENDER PACKAGING AND I SHARE WITH YOU SENATOR WHERE YOU KNOW OF. OUR TEN WHO. OUR PART OF THE GAINS ARE VERY. THAT THEY WILL HAVE THEIR- OF FOLKS ON THE STREET GO AND GET EMPLOYMENT AT PLACES THAT DELIVER TASK. AND TRY TO SHIFT TAX SWITCH PACKAGES AND- PUT CONTRABAND AND IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THERE SO IS THE ONGOING BATTLE. BUT WE ARE VERY MUCH UP TO THE CHALLENGE OF TRYING TO IDENTIFY ONE RESOURCES INTO IDEALS. AND LOOKING AT A BEST PRACTICES NATIONWIDE. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I KNOW YOU DID REFER A COUPLE OF TIMES TO THE- DELEGATION YOU'RE PART OF TO NORWAY AND YOU SHARED WITH ME SOME OF YOUR SKEPTICISM IN THE- NOISE A LITTLE MORE HOMOGENOUS THAN. CALIFORNIA'S PRISON SYSTEM. BUT YOU DID SHARE SOME TAKEAWAYS AND MAYBE MY FINAL QUESTION IF. WHAT WERE SOME OF THE TAKE AWAY IS THAT YOU THINK COULD HAVE CURRENCY IN. CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON SYSTEM I THINK THE BIGGEST TAKEAWAY FROM A SENATOR AS YOU SAID I WAS A LITTLE SKEPTIC. CONAN BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE X. BACK. BUT THE REALIZATION THAT HIT ME BY THE SECOND DAY OF BAND THERE AND REALLY ENGAGING WITH THE STAFF ENGAGING WITH THEIR POPULATION. IS NOT ABOUT THE TYPE OF OFFENDER REALLY REALLY WANT TO BOIL DOWN TO WAS THE INTERACTION BETWEEN STAFF AND THE OFFENDER. THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY THERE WAS A MUTUAL RESPECT THE ENGAGEMENT WITH SO MUCH DIFFERENT. THAT IT INSURED AND WORK TOWARD SAFETY FOR EVERYBODY AND I THINK THAT IS. SOMETHING THAT I TOOK AWAY SOMETHING THAT AS A DIVISION WE WILL BE WORKING ON. IS HOW DO WE SWITCH OF THE DYNAMIC OF THE ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN OUR STAFFING THE OFFENDER WHERE IS CREATING A MORE HUMANE ENVIRONMENT. THAT THE END OF THE DAY ARE INDIVIDUAL GOING HOME. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE DO PRO SOCIAL BEHAVIORS- MODIFICATIONS THAT WERE REALLY PREPARE FOLKS AND AT THE BEGINNING OF IT WE'VE GOT TO BE RUN HUMANE PRISONS. AND IT HAS TO BE. A LEVEL PRIEST BETWEEN ARE SO IN THE- I THINK. STAFF IN A INTERACTION SO A KEEPING FOR ME AND I'M EXCITED ABOUT TAKING A CHALLENGE ON. CREATE ONE ONE THING THAT CAME ACROSS CLEARLY WISH YOUR ENTHUSIASM AND GIVEN THE- AS A THE BUREAUCRACY IN THE CHALLENGES. SOMETIMES IN TWO YES. FALLS BY THE WAYSIDE SO WE'RE LIKE TO HAVE KNOW. FOR SUPPORT YEAR COME FROM. TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU WE HAD A WONDERFUL DISCUSSION IN MY OFFICE. WITH ME IS GIVE SENATE-TV I CONSIDER HER AN ABSOLUTE ICON IN THE BUSINESS OF CORRECTIONS WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED IS WHAT IT ALWAYS% GOES ON BETWEEN THE CAPTURE THE CAPTIVE IT'S NOT A GOOD RELATIONSHIP AND CHANGING ABOUT PROBABLY TO SOMETHING THAT'S CLOSER TO MENTORSHIP GASOL'S WHERE WE WANT TO GO. SO AND I KNOW THAT FOR THE YEARS THAT YOU HAVE SERVICE STILL HAVE THIS PASSION WE NEED SOME OF YOUR JUICE MAYBE CAN SHARE THAT WITH US BECAUSE IT'S AN AMAZING THE AMAZING STORY BUT MY QUESTION GOES WHICH WE DIDN'T DISCUSS WE DISCUSSED A LOT ABOUT RESTORATIVE JUSTICE AND I'M I'M THERE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. BAD BOB THE COSTS IN CD R. HAS GONE UP SIGNIFICANTLY EVEN THOUGH ON THE POPULATION IS GONE DOWN AND I'M WONDERING IF A COMPONENT OF THAT CERTAINLY SALARIES ON COST OF LIVING AND NOT AS A BED IS RESTORED AND JUSTICE FROM PAUL. OF THE INCREASE IN CASA TYPES OF. AND COULD YOU DO. IN TERMS OF THAT IN THE END THE YOU KNOW IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY WE WANT TO HAVE OUTCOMES THAT WE KNOW WE'RE INVESTING A LOT OF MONEY AND THAT. IS THAT THAT DOESN'T SEEM THAT SHOULDN'T BE A NEGATIVE I GUESS IS WHAT I'M SAYING IF YOU CAN AKON ACCOUNT FOR THAT IN TERMS OF THE COST OF THOSE PROGRAMS AND HOW YOU'RE MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION RIGHT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK IN IN TO TALK ABOUT COST AND THE- WHERE DOES RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PROGRAMS PLAY INTO IT. AS I SHARE WITH YOU SENATOR THAT WE'VE ENGAGED IN BRAND NEW CONTRACTS TO PROVIDE COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR INTERVENTIONS WHICH PART OF THAT WOULD BE VICTIM IMPACT- CLASSES FOR OFFENDERS AND REALLY FOCUS IN ON. THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE YOU READY TO PEROT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR MONTHS TO THE COMMUNITY TO TRY TO ENSURE THEY GET PROGRAMMING BUT ALSO THE DIVISION OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAM IS IN THE PROCESS OF CONTRACTING WITH THE UNIVERSITY TO DO JUST WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SENATOR TO BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE. THE EFFICACY OF PROGRAMS COST EFFECTIVE DOESN'T REDUCE RECIDIVISM ARE WE USING AN IS STICKING TO EVIDENCE BASED CURRICULA WE ASSURE THAT WE HAVE QUALIFY PROVIDERS I'M AND I SHARE WITH YOU THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO RAISE THE SALARIES SO THAT WE CAN RECRUIT QUALIFIED PROVIDERS. AND SO WE TO KNOW WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO BE RESPONSIBLE WITH THE STATE'S MONEY AND SO THE VISION OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAM IS TO PUT CONTRACTS IN PLACE TO DO JUST WITH THAT TO REALLY LIVE OUR PROGRAMS IS THERE EVIDENCE BASED ARE REDUCE WE OF THEM ARE COST EFFECTIVE. AND ARE THEY WORKING. EIGHT YES I HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS. CAN ON YOUR NOMINATION AND YOU'LL- A- MY ONE HUNDRED AND- PER. SUPPORT YOU BECAUSE- FOR LEASE SENATOR LEADING. UP JOURNEY THAT YOU MAY ON THANK YOU FOR YOU. SERVICE CENTER THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU MADAM FOR TEN SORRY WE DID NOT GET AN OPPORTUNITY- TO GET TOGETHER BUT I WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR PLANET THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE- AND I APPRECIATE- CENTER MONIES QUESTION THE CONTRABAND. I'VE DONE MANY TOURS OF PRISONS AND WHAT TIME WAS THERE ON A LOCKDOWN AND I WAS SHOCKED AT HOW MUCH CONTRABAND- WAS THERE WHICH OBVIOUSLY PUTS EVERYBODY AT RISK SO THAT'S GOOD HOPEFULLY IF IT'S SUCCESSFUL THAT WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT. AND I ALSO FEEL LIKE YOU GUYS GOT A LOT OF MOMENTUM TO WHEN I FIRST TOWARD WHICH IS BEFORE I GOT ELECTED TO THE ASSEMBLY IN TWENTY TWELVE. THERE'S NO COMMUNITY COLLEGE CLASSES. IN THE FACILITY AT A- REAL QUICK PEOPLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL ONCE THEY GET OUT SO AND I KNOW THAT'S BEEN A CRACKED YES COOPER THAT DEAL THAT DID FULL FUNDING A RESTORED FULL FUNDING TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES FOR DOING THAT SO THAT'S ALL GOOD. DALY MINISTRATION HAS SAID THAT IF. PRISON POPULATION STAYS THE SAME. THAT THEY PLAN TO CLOSE- AT LEAST ONE FACILITY WITH THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. COULD YOU POSSIBLY SHARE WHAT THAT CRITERIA WOULD BE. WELL I THINK IN OCE DEPARTMENT MAKES A DECISION IN ADMINISTRATION DECIDES TO CLOSE THE FACILITY THERE WILL BE SEVERAL THINGS HAVE TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN CHOOSING A FACILITY. AND IT. I'M SORRY THERE SESSION IT. THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS THAT WILL BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION AND ONE WILL BE THE- TWELVE PRISON STUDY REPORT THAT HAS BEEN ONE BY THE VENDOR THAT WILL HELP INFORM SOME OF THAT AS IT RELATES TO- THE COST TO REHAB PRISONS AND WHAT HAVE YOU BUT ALSO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE AVAILABILITY ASSESSABLE THE OF A WORK FORCE AND THE ABILITY TO HIRE AND RETAIN STAFF AND- TO BE ABLE GET PROGRAM THE STAFF AND- THE- THERE'S SEVERAL THINGS THAT WILL BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN IS. TRYING TO ENSURE THAT WHEN THOSE DECISIONS ARE MADE. WHICH IS IN THE RIGHT PRESENT. THAT WILL HOPEFULLY HAVE THE LEAST IMPACT TO THE STILL TRYING TO PROVIDE WHAT OUR MISSION IS WAS REHABILITATION TO THE OFFENDERS. GREAT I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER AND LOOKING FORWARD TO SUPPORTING YOUR CONFIRMATION THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU SENATOR ROTH THANK YOU MAYOR PRO TEM- CONGRATULATIONS MAN AND DIRECTOR THANK YOU SIR- YOU HAVE A VERY IMPRESSIVE RESUME. FIVE FRANKLY LISTENED INTENTLY TO YOUR RESPONSES AND YOUR RESPONSES FOR EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE. I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR SERVICE AND TO SING THE PRODUCT OF YOUR EFFORTS AND- I WILL BE MOVING IF I'M GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO YOUR CONFIRMATION AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU FOR SERVING. THANK YOU SENATOR- I ENJOYED HEARING YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT- YOUR TRIP TO NORWAY AND THE CULTURE SHIFT. CLEARLY WE HAVE PROBABLY GOT THE BIGGEST PRISON POPULATION IN THE WORLD WE HAVE A DIFFERENT CULTURE I THINK- SENATOR MINING USE THE WORD HOMOGENEOUS. OF FOR NORWAY VALUE RIGHT THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT I MEANT- SO YEAH I AND I'M GLAD TO SEE YOUR ENTHUSIASM I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES YOUR YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. ARE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO NOW THAT YOU'RE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO STEP INTO THIS ROLE AND BE THE ONE TO GET TO HELP SHAPE IT. BUT CULTURE CHANGES REALLY HARD AS WE ARE LEARNING IN OUR OWN HOUSE- AS IT RELATES TO THINGS THAT WERE HAVING TO DO SO- A YOU ARE. ON THAT LNG FLIGHT HOME FROM NORWAY THOUGHT ABOUT ALL THE WAYS YOU COULD. IMPRINT UPON THIS AN IMPACTED- ID DO YOU HAVE ANY SPECIFICS ARE THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT TO SHARE ON HOW TO GET STARTED I MEAN YOUR VISION. IS ABSOLUTELY. WONDERFUL YEAH I DO HAVE SOME IDEAS SENATOR THANK YOU. I'M I THINK THE BIGGEST THING IN AND THIS IS A TAKE AWAY FROM NORWAY. AND YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT TO YOU GET OUTSIDE OF YOUR TO ALL SYSTEM IN STAR HEARING THESE IDEALS. BUT SOME AS SIMPLE AS DO WE HAVE POLICIES PROCEDURES. OR PRAY. THAT I'LL USE THE TERM DE ESCALATE VERSUS CLAY OR THAT REALLY AREN'T HUMANIZING PRACTICES THEY ARE TO THE INFORMATION. AND I THOSE ARE SOME THINGS THAT. QUICKLY OVER TIME WE CAN REALLY REAL SASS AND DECIDE BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN DOING SO FOR TWENTY YEARS IS A STILL THE PROPER WAY TO DO BUSINESS. WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HAVING A PRISON SYSTEM WHERE IT IS BEHAVIOR BASS EACH INDIVIDUAL OFFENDER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN BEHAVIOR SHOULD BE TREATED AS AN INDIVIDUAL NOT LOVE TO SOME LUCK TOGETHER IN THIS. GROUP AND WE SAY THESE ARE CARE POLICIES THAT WE'VE HAD IN PLACE FOR TWENTY YEARS JUST APPLY AS A ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS THAT I HAVE A WORK GROUP NOW SENATOR THAT'S WORKING ON THIS. THE FIRST ONE WE'RE TACKLING AS AND NOW USES SHOULD EVERY OFFENDER IN RESTRICTIVE HOUSING AND RESTRICTIVE HOUSING IS WHERE AN OFFENDER MAY GO BECAUSE THEY HAVE SAFETY CONCERNS- THAT HAVEN'T. BEEN RESOLVED THAT THEY'VE GOT A DISCIPLINARY. BUT DOES A OFFENDER AND RESEARCH TO HOUSING HAS TO BE IN RESTRAINTS ALL THE TIME IS THAT REALLY NEED IT AND SO IT SEEMS LIKE THAT THAT I THINK WE CAN DO A CRITICAL ASSESSMENT OF OUR OWN POLICIES PRACTICES. AND PROCEDURES AND THAT'S A STARTING POINT THE OTHER PART THAT I THINK IS CRITICAL. AND I'M VERY APPRECIATIVE ADMINISTRATION IN THIS S THAT OUR TRAINING OUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FROM R. A C. POST AS WELL AS OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR OVER TRAINING ACADEMY ARE GOING TO NORMAL MARCH. AND I REALLY WANT THEM TO LOOK AT. SOME OF THEIR TRAINING IN HOW THEY TRAIN BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S THINGS THAT WE CAN DO- DIFFERENTLY. AND THE AND THE BIG KEY PART OF IT FOR ME IS REALLY. RESHAPING REDEFINING. THE STAFF IN MADE IN OUR ACTIONS WE'VE GOT IT WE TO FLYING THAT. AND MAKE IT OKAY FOR US AFTER YOU KNOW I GO OUT SENATOR AND I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO. BRAND NEW CADETS ON DAY TWO OF THEIR THIRTEEN WEEK ACADEMY. AND I TALK TO THEM ABOUT THEIR WORLDLY REHABILITATION. IS REALLY ABOUT MODELING PROSOCIAL BEHAVIORS AN ADVOCATE BUT THEY HAVE BEEN THERE IN THEIR REHABILITATION BECAUSE THEY'RE COMING HOME. BUT PART OF THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH FOLKS. AND I THINK SOMETIMES WE'VE. ALMOST PUT UP A BARRIER WHEN OUR STAFF IN REGARDS TO BE TALKED ABOUT YOU DON'T WANT TO BE. COMPROMISE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE. CAUGHT UP BY THE OFFENDER FORCES WE NEED TO SAY I NEED TO BE PERSONABLE I NEED TO SAY HI GOOD MORNING TO FOLKS HOW WAS IT I HEARD THAT YOUR SON GRADUATED BICYCLE HOW DID THAT GO. VERSUS PRIVATE I DON'T NEED TO TELL THE OFFENDER WHAT YOU DID LAST NIGHT. AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE A RE EDUCATION OF OUR SYSTEM. TO GET PEOPLE TO THINK A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY BUT I THINK IT CAN BE DONE I TRULY THINK. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HEALTH OF AN INSTITUTION EMPLOYEES AND THE OFFENDERS THE DYNAMIC OF FOLKS WHO WERE THERE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN WITH EACH OTHER HAS TO BE IMPROVED AND HAS TO BE DIFFERENTLY AND I KNOW IT'S A HUGE HUGE ON TAKING I'M NOT NAIVE IN THIS. BUT MY INTENT IS REALLY TO START TO GROW MORE. TO AFFECT CHANGE AND THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO SENATOR. THANK YOU I WILL LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING MORE ABOUT HOW THIS IS GOING AS I LOOK AT THE SECRETARY- IN AND TO ENSURE THE SUPPORT IS THERE- SO THAT YOU DON'T LOSE THAT ENTHUSIASM BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S HARD WORK. I DON'T THINK ANY OF US HAVE THE AT AN IDEA OF JUST HOW HARD IT IS FRANKLY- SO THANK YOU AND CONGRATULATIONS WITH THAT LET ME- SEE IF THERE ARE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC HERE IN SUPPORT.
