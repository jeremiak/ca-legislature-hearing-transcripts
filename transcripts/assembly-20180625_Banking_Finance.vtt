US SENATE BILL TWELVE THIRTY

00:25:19.184 --> 00:25:19.951
FIVE I WOULD GIVE TO SMALL

00:25:20.018 --> 00:25:21.253
BUSINESS OWNERS.

00:25:21.319 --> 00:25:23.088
MANY OF THE SAME PROTECTIONS

00:25:23.154 --> 00:25:24.155
THAT OUR COUNTRY'S TRUTH IN

00:25:24.222 --> 00:25:25.824
LENDING LAWS HAVE GIVEN CONSUMER

00:25:25.891 --> 00:25:27.893
BORROWERS FOR MORE THAN HALF A

00:25:27.959 --> 00:25:28.627
CENTURY.

00:25:28.693 --> 00:25:29.694
THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE LENDERS

00:25:29.761 --> 00:25:31.863
AND FINANCE COMPANIES. TO

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:33.331
PROVIDE CLEAR AND CONSISTENT

00:25:33.398 --> 00:25:35.066
DISCLOSURE.

00:25:35.133 --> 00:25:37.002
SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHEN THEY

00:25:37.068 --> 00:25:38.904
OFFER THEM FINANCING AND WHEN

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:40.572
THEY CLOSE THE DEAL.

00:25:40.639 --> 00:25:41.539
THIS INFORMATION WOULD HELP

00:25:41.606 --> 00:25:43.208
SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS UNDERSTAND

00:25:43.275 --> 00:25:45.443
THE COST AND THE CONSEQUENCES.

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:46.511
BUT THE FINANCING OPTIONS

00:25:46.578 --> 00:25:48.046
AVAILABLE TO THEM.

00:25:48.113 --> 00:25:49.347
IN THE RAPIDLY EVOLVING

00:25:49.414 --> 00:25:51.750
COMMERCIAL LENDING MARKET.

00:25:51.816 --> 00:25:52.784
UNTIL NOW OUR TRUTH IN LENDING

00:25:52.851 --> 00:25:54.319
LAWS APPLIED ONLY TO CONSUMER

00:25:54.386 --> 00:25:56.221
FINANCE.

00:25:56.288 --> 00:25:57.522
BUSINESS OWNERS WERE LEFT TO

00:25:57.589 --> 00:25:59.357
FEND FOR THEMSELVES.

00:25:59.424 --> 00:26:00.358
ON THE THEORY THAT THEY WERE

00:26:00.425 --> 00:26:01.760
SOPHISTICATED MERCHANTS WHO

00:26:01.826 --> 00:26:04.596
UNDERSTOOD THE WORLD OF FINANCE.

00:26:04.663 --> 00:26:05.997
INCREASINGLY HOWEVER THAT IS NO

00:26:06.064 --> 00:26:07.465
LONGER TRUE.

00:26:07.532 --> 00:26:08.833
TODAY'S SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.068
ARE OFTEN IMMIGRANT

00:26:10.135 --> 00:26:11.803
ENTREPRENEURS STRUGGLING TO GET

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:13.305
THEIR ENTERPRISES OFF THE GROUND

00:26:13.371 --> 00:26:14.339
WITH LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF THE

00:26:14.406 --> 00:26:16.608
FINANCE INDUSTRY.

00:26:16.675 --> 00:26:18.009
TRADITIONAL BANKS MEANWHILE ARE

00:26:18.076 --> 00:26:19.511
NO LONGER INTERESTED IN MAKING

00:26:19.577 --> 00:26:21.479
SMALLER LOANS INSTEAD THAT SPACE

00:26:21.546 --> 00:26:22.814
IS BEING FILLED BY INNOVATIVE

00:26:22.881 --> 00:26:24.249
LENDERS OFFERING AN ARRAY OF

00:26:24.316 --> 00:26:26.584
FINANCIAL OPTIONS.

00:26:26.651 --> 00:26:29.087
THIS NEW ONLINE LENDING INDUSTRY

00:26:29.154 --> 00:26:30.455
IS BRINGING CAPITAL TO PEOPLE

00:26:30.522 --> 00:26:32.057
WHO BADLY NEEDED.

00:26:32.123 --> 00:26:34.492
BUT THERE ARE ABUSES.

00:26:34.559 --> 00:26:36.461
THIS BILL OFFERS A MODEST

00:26:36.528 --> 00:26:38.630
MEASURE DISCLOSURE. TO HELP

00:26:38.697 --> 00:26:39.664
LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR

00:26:39.731 --> 00:26:41.533
SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS.

00:26:41.599 --> 00:26:43.468
IT WOULD MAKE CALIFORNIA LEADER

00:26:43.535 --> 00:26:44.669
IN PLACE IN THE INTERESTS OF

00:26:44.736 --> 00:26:46.404
SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS.

00:26:46.471 --> 00:26:47.839
ON PAR WITH THE BIG PLAYERS IN

00:26:47.906 --> 00:26:50.675
THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY.

00:26:50.742 --> 00:26:52.043
NOW IF YOU BORROWED MONEY FOR A

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:53.812
HOUSE OR A CAR SIMPLY TAKING OUT

00:26:53.878 --> 00:26:55.080
A PERSONAL LOAN OR USED A CREDIT

00:26:55.146 --> 00:26:56.514
CARD.

00:26:56.581 --> 00:26:58.350
SEEN THE KIND OF DISCLOSURES

00:26:58.416 --> 00:27:00.352
THAT THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE.

00:27:00.418 --> 00:27:01.119
THEY TELL YOU HOW MUCH YOUR

00:27:01.186 --> 00:27:02.187
BORROWING ALL THE FEES YOU'LL BE

00:27:02.253 --> 00:27:03.555
PAYING.

00:27:03.621 --> 00:27:05.090
HOW LONG WILL TAKE YOU TO REPAY

00:27:05.156 --> 00:27:07.058
THE LOAN AND THE ANNUAL

00:27:07.125 --> 00:27:09.127
ANNUALIZED INTEREST RATE?

00:27:09.194 --> 00:27:10.128
THE LENDERS KNOW ALL THIS

00:27:10.195 --> 00:27:11.930
INFORMATION ALREADY.

00:27:11.997 --> 00:27:13.465
SOME OF THEM EVEN DISCLOSE IT IN

00:27:13.531 --> 00:27:14.733
THE FINANCIAL MARKETS WHEN THEY

00:27:14.799 --> 00:27:16.267
PACKAGE THEIR SMALL BUSINESS

00:27:16.334 --> 00:27:17.035
LOANS AND SELL THEM AS

00:27:17.102 --> 00:27:19.104
SECURITIES.

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:20.071
ALL WE'RE ASKING IS THAT THE

00:27:20.138 --> 00:27:21.072
SCHOOL THAT THEY DISCLOSE THE

00:27:21.139 --> 00:27:21.973
SAME INFORMATION TO THEIR

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:23.842
CUSTOMERS.

00:27:23.908 --> 00:27:25.076
IT'S GOOD FOR WALL STREET SHOULD

00:27:25.143 --> 00:27:26.911
BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR MAIN STREET.

00:27:26.978 --> 00:27:28.513
THIS BILL IS UNDERGONE EXTENSIVE

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.115

00:27:30.181 --> 00:27:31.483

00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:32.684
WE'VE TAKEN SUGGESTIONS FROM

00:27:32.751 --> 00:27:33.852
MANY OF THE PLAYERS THEM IN THIS

00:27:33.918 --> 00:27:34.686
INDUSTRY AND FOR MOST OF THE

00:27:34.753 --> 00:27:36.321
OPPONENTS.

00:27:36.388 --> 00:27:38.757
BUT WILL NEVER SATISFY EVERYONE.

00:27:38.823 --> 00:27:39.858
MANY THE COMPANIES THAT LEAD TO

00:27:39.924 --> 00:27:41.559
SMALL BUSINESS.

00:27:41.626 --> 00:27:43.595
SIMPLY DO NOT WANT TO DISCLOSE

00:27:43.661 --> 00:27:44.729
THE TERMS OF THEIR LOANS TO

00:27:44.796 --> 00:27:46.431
THEIR CUSTOMERS.

00:27:46.498 --> 00:27:47.332

00:27:51.336 --> 00:27:53.004
GOVERN CONSUMER LENDING.

00:27:53.071 --> 00:27:54.172
EVEN IF THAT MIGHT NOT BE

00:27:54.239 --> 00:27:55.106
PRACTICAL FOR THE BUSINESS

00:27:55.173 --> 00:27:56.775
LENDING MARKET.

00:27:56.841 --> 00:27:58.410
LET ME FINISH UP I THINK WE'VE

00:27:58.476 --> 00:27:59.244
STRUCK THE RIGHT BALANCE IN THIS

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:01.479
BILL REQUIRES CLEAR CONSISTENT

00:28:01.546 --> 00:28:02.480
DISCLOSURE.

00:28:02.547 --> 00:28:04.315
BUT DOES NOT RESTRICT THE KIND

00:28:04.382 --> 00:28:04.883

00:28:04.949 --> 00:28:06.017
OFFER.

00:28:06.084 --> 00:28:07.485
AND WILL NOT LEAD TO ANY LOSS OF

00:28:07.552 --> 00:28:08.653
ACCESS TO CAPITAL IN THE SMALL

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.122

00:28:50.495 --> 00:28:51.763
AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:53.498

00:29:00.004 --> 00:29:01.072
CONSIDER THE IMPACT THIS

LEGISLATION CAN HAVE SMALL

00:29:02.807 --> 00:29:04.275

BUSINESSES FELL.

00:29:14.953 --> 00:29:15.553
IS DUE TO POOR CREDIT

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:17.722

00:29:21.526 --> 00:29:23.761
FINANCING CREDIT.

00:29:23.828 --> 00:29:24.596

INTIMATELY AWARE OF THE HELP

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:43.915
THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE SMALL

00:29:43.982 --> 00:29:45.216
BUSINESS OWNERS.

00:29:45.283 --> 00:29:46.551
I'VE SEEN OUR STRUGGLE ON A

00:29:46.618 --> 00:29:47.452
DAILY BASIS AND HAVE BEEN IN

00:29:47.519 --> 00:29:49.487
THEIR SHOES.

00:29:49.554 --> 00:29:50.355
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO FEEL

00:29:50.421 --> 00:29:51.656
LIKE THE SUCCESSES.

00:29:51.723 --> 00:29:53.625

IN THE BUSINESS LENDING WORLD.

IF YOU HAVEN'T EXPERIENCED IT

00:30:01.132 --> 00:30:02.867
IT'S EASY TO SAY THE BORROWER

00:30:02.934 --> 00:30:04.702
WILL FIGURE IT OUT.

00:30:04.769 --> 00:30:06.004
THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING THE

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:07.739
REALITY IS THAT SMALL BUSINESS

00:30:07.805 --> 00:30:09.908
OWNERS ARE NOT FINANCIAL EXPERTS.

00:30:09.974 --> 00:30:11.309
THESE ARE NOT FORTUNE FIVE

00:30:11.376 --> 00:30:12.110
HUNDRED COMPANIES ARE TALKING

00:30:12.177 --> 00:30:15.446

00:30:16.114 --> 00:30:18.049
PEOPLE.

00:30:18.116 --> 00:30:18.650
THESE ARE BUSINESSES WITHOUT A

00:30:25.723 --> 00:30:27.458
IS EXTREMELY TAXING BUSINESS

00:30:27.525 --> 00:30:28.726
OWNERS CAN'T SPEND HOURS AND

00:30:28.793 --> 00:30:29.727
HOURS TRYING TO DECIPHER LOAN

00:30:29.794 --> 00:30:31.629
DISCLOSURES.

00:30:31.696 --> 00:30:33.031
THAT'S ONE ANNUALIZED COST OF

00:30:33.097 --> 00:30:33.965
CAPITAL NEEDS TO BE A PART OF

00:30:34.032 --> 00:30:36.134
THIS LEGISLATION.

00:30:36.201 --> 00:30:37.936
THE BEST METHOD WE HAVE TO

00:30:38.002 --> 00:30:39.137
CREATE A QUICK APPLES TO APPLES

00:30:39.204 --> 00:30:40.972
COST COMPARISON.

00:30:41.039 --> 00:30:42.273
WE'VE HAD IS PROTECTION FOR

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:43.341
CONSUMERS FOR YEARS IT'S ALREADY

00:30:43.408 --> 00:30:46.044
SETTLED LAW.

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:47.979
THE BILL'S OPPOSITION CLAIM AN

00:30:48.046 --> 00:30:49.113
ANNUALIZED COST OF CAPITAL WILL

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:51.282
CONFUSE BORROWERS THE FACT IS

00:30:51.349 --> 00:30:52.517
THAT AN ANNUALIZED RATE WHICH

00:30:52.584 --> 00:30:54.219
INCLUDES ALL COSTS.

00:30:54.285 --> 00:30:55.620
WE'LL SIMPLY REVEAL HOW

00:30:55.687 --> 00:30:56.254
EXPENSIVE SOME OF THESE PRODUCTS

00:30:56.321 --> 00:30:57.589
CAN BE.

00:30:57.655 --> 00:30:59.157
IF THIS FORCES THEM TO EXPLAIN

00:30:59.224 --> 00:31:00.258
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SHORT

00:31:00.325 --> 00:31:02.427
TERM VERSUS LONG TERM CAPITAL.

00:31:02.493 --> 00:31:04.162
AND THE EFFECT THAT HAS ON AN

00:31:04.229 --> 00:31:05.997
ANNUALIZED RATE AND SO BE IT.

00:31:06.064 --> 00:31:06.898
IT'S BETTER THAN THE CURRENT

00:31:06.965 --> 00:31:08.199
SYSTEM THAT PUTS ALL THE BURDEN

00:31:08.266 --> 00:31:10.535
ON THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNER.

00:31:10.602 --> 00:31:11.669
WE'VE ALREADY AGREED THAT ARE

00:31:11.736 --> 00:31:13.304
THAT USING AN ANNUALIZED RATE IS

00:31:13.371 --> 00:31:14.806
THE BEST WAY FOR CONSUMERS TO

00:31:14.872 --> 00:31:16.241
COMPARE LOANS WHY SHOULD BE

00:31:16.307 --> 00:31:16.808
DIFFERENT FOR SMALL BUSINESS

00:31:16.874 --> 00:31:19.410
OWNERS.

00:31:19.477 --> 00:31:20.912
MOST REPUTABLE BUSINESS LETTERS

00:31:20.979 --> 00:31:22.480
ALREADY PROVIDE AN ANNUALIZED

00:31:22.547 --> 00:31:23.081
RATE BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHAT'S

00:31:23.147 --> 00:31:24.315
THE BEST WAY FOR A BORROWER TO

00:31:24.382 --> 00:31:26.718
COMPARE LOANS.

00:31:26.784 --> 00:31:28.253
IN TERMS ALTERNATE BLENDER SUCH

00:31:28.319 --> 00:31:29.420
AS CABBAGE ON JACK IN SMART

00:31:29.487 --> 00:31:30.822
BUSINESS LOANS.

00:31:30.888 --> 00:31:33.625
ARE USING TOOLS SUCH A SMART BOX.

00:31:33.691 --> 00:31:36.194
TO PROVIDE NECESSARY DISCLOSURES.

00:31:36.261 --> 00:31:37.195
THEY KNOW IT'S THE RIGHT THING

00:31:37.262 --> 00:31:38.863
TO DO THIS BILL IS JUST A WAY TO

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:39.998
STANDARDIZE AND REQUIRE THIS

00:31:40.064 --> 00:31:41.366
ACROSS THE INDUSTRY.

00:31:41.432 --> 00:31:42.900
SO THAT THE FEW BAD APPLES CAN'T

00:31:42.967 --> 00:31:45.903
CONTINUE TO SEE BUSINESS OWNERS

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:46.871
THIS BILL ISN'T ABOUT REGULATING

00:31:46.938 --> 00:31:48.139
THE CASA BUSINESS LOANS ARE

00:31:48.206 --> 00:31:49.507
TRYING TO HARM BUSINESS LINERS

00:31:49.574 --> 00:31:51.609
WHICH WE WOULDN'T SUPPORT.

00:31:51.676 --> 00:31:52.810
THERE ARE LEGITIMATE TIMES WHEN

00:31:52.877 --> 00:31:54.178
A TRIPLE DIGIT ANNUALISED RATE

00:31:54.245 --> 00:31:55.179
IS A SMART DECISION FOR BUSINESS

00:31:55.246 --> 00:31:56.581
OWNER.

00:31:56.648 --> 00:31:57.649
BUT THE BUSINESS OWNER DESERVES

00:31:57.715 --> 00:31:58.950
TO HAVE A CLEAR WAY OF COMPARING

00:31:59.017 --> 00:32:00.218
PRODUCTS AND KNOWING HOW MUCH

00:32:00.285 --> 00:32:01.953
IT'S GOING TO COST THEM.

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:03.588
IF THE TERMS ARE TRANSPARENT A

00:32:03.655 --> 00:32:04.422
BUSINESS OWNER MAKES A BAD

00:32:04.489 --> 00:32:06.557
DECISION THAT IT'S ON THEM. TO

00:32:06.624 --> 00:32:08.192
CLAIM EDUCATING A SMALL BUSINESS

00:32:08.259 --> 00:32:09.727
OWNER ON THE TRUE COST OF

00:32:09.794 --> 00:32:10.762
CAPITAL IS A HARM TO THEM IS

00:32:10.828 --> 00:32:12.930
SIMPLY RIDICULOUS.

00:32:12.997 --> 00:32:14.165
UNLIKE THE OPPONENTS WE HAVE

00:32:14.232 --> 00:32:15.300
NOTHING TO GAIN BY PASSING THIS

00:32:15.366 --> 00:32:16.668
BILL WE JUST KNOW IT'S THE RIGHT

00:32:16.734 --> 00:32:18.403
THING TO DO.

WE ALSOBELIEVE IT CAN BECOME A

00:32:19.837 --> 00:32:21.239
MODEL FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY AND

00:32:21.306 --> 00:32:22.640
WILL POSITIVELY IMPACT MILLIONS

00:32:22.707 --> 00:32:24.108

00:32:24.175 --> 00:32:24.842

00:36:30.888 --> 00:36:31.923
I'M SO I'M SURE YOU PROBABLY

00:36:31.989 --> 00:36:33.357
CAN'T SEE THIS FROM HERE I'M

00:36:33.424 --> 00:36:35.126
HAPPY TO PROVIDE IRAQ COPIES OF

00:36:35.192 --> 00:36:36.193
PEOPLE LIKE TO SEE IT --

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:38.296
MORE CLOSELY SO WE REALLY WE DID

00:36:38.362 --> 00:36:39.630
MAKE THESE DISCLOSURES

00:36:39.697 --> 00:36:41.132
VOLUNTARILY BECAUSE WE WANT OUR

00:36:41.198 --> 00:36:42.567
SMALL BUSINESS CUSTOMERS TO BE

00:36:42.633 --> 00:36:44.068
INFORMED SO THAT THEY CAN PICK

00:36:44.135 --> 00:36:45.570
THE RIGHT FINANCING PRODUCT FOR

00:36:45.636 --> 00:36:46.904
THEIR USE CASE.

00:36:46.971 --> 00:36:48.506
AND WE DO BELIEVE AND I THINK AS

00:36:48.573 --> 00:36:52.009
THE AUTHOR.

00:36:52.076 --> 00:36:54.111
AND BUT WE STRONGLY --

00:36:54.178 --> 00:36:55.846
OPPOSE THE TWELFTH SIR S. B.

00:36:55.913 --> 00:36:57.081
TWELVE THIRTY FIVES INCLUSION OF

00:36:57.148 --> 00:36:59.550
THIS UNTESTED NEW METRIC THE ACC

00:36:59.617 --> 00:37:01.419
OR E. ACC --

00:37:01.485 --> 00:37:02.320
BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT IT WILL

00:37:02.386 --> 00:37:04.488
FRUSTRATE RATHER THAN FACILITATE

00:37:04.555 --> 00:37:06.357
AN APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON

00:37:06.424 --> 00:37:07.925
ACROSS PRODUCTS.

00:37:07.992 --> 00:37:08.626
AND HERE'S WHY.

00:37:08.693 --> 00:37:11.495
I'M A LITTLE [inaudible]

00:37:11.562 --> 00:37:13.898
CARD.

00:37:13.965 --> 00:37:16.601
AS YOU CAN SEE APR AND ACC LOOK

00:37:16.667 --> 00:37:17.401
A LOT ALIKE.

00:37:17.468 --> 00:37:19.704
THEY'RE BOTH PERCENTAGES.

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:21.639
I'M WHICH IS GOING TO CAUSE

00:37:21.706 --> 00:37:23.474
CONFUSION FOR BORROWERS AND

00:37:23.541 --> 00:37:26.611
THESE TWO HERE APR AND ECC.

00:37:26.677 --> 00:37:28.679
ARE THIS ARE FOR THE EXACT SAME

00:37:28.746 --> 00:37:30.881
LOAN ONE SIXTH MONTH FIFTY

00:37:30.948 --> 00:37:32.583
THOUSAND DOLLAR LOAN WITH THE

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:35.686
EXACT SAME INTERESTS AND FEES.

00:37:35.753 --> 00:37:39.223
APR THIRTY THREE POINT SIX ACC

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:40.758
TWENTY TWO POINT.

00:37:40.825 --> 00:37:41.859
SIX THREE ONCE LOOKING A LOT

00:37:41.926 --> 00:37:42.893
HIGHER THAN THE OTHER FOR THE

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.229
EXACT SAME LOAN WITH THE SAME

00:37:45.296 --> 00:37:47.064
COSTS.

00:37:47.131 --> 00:37:48.265
SO THIS IS BASICALLY ACC JUST

00:37:48.332 --> 00:37:51.802
LIKE IS A PR BUT SMALLER --

00:37:51.869 --> 00:37:52.970
THAT'S WHAT SORT OF LIKE

00:37:53.037 --> 00:37:53.771
INTRODUCING A NEW FEDERAL FOOD

00:37:53.838 --> 00:37:56.007
MEASUREMENT FOR EXAMPLE WHERE I

00:37:56.073 --> 00:37:58.042
CAN LOOK AT THE SENATE BOND AND

00:37:58.109 --> 00:37:58.509
SAY.

00:37:58.576 --> 00:37:59.877
OH DOESN'T HAVE NINE HUNDRED

00:37:59.944 --> 00:38:00.578
CALORIES ANYMORE IT HAS SIX

00:38:00.645 --> 00:38:01.245
HUNDRED CALORIES --

00:38:01.312 --> 00:38:02.513
AND I THINK JUST LIKE THAT WOULD

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:03.914
DRIVE PEOPLE TO MAKE BAD FOOD

00:38:03.981 --> 00:38:06.283
DECISIONS ON THIS A C. IT'S

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:07.985
GONNA TENSELY MISLEAD FARMERS

00:38:08.052 --> 00:38:09.353
INTO CHOOSING POTENTIALLY MORE

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:11.288
EXPENSIVE PRODUCTS BECAUSE

00:38:11.355 --> 00:38:12.823
THEY'RE GOING TO CONFLATE APR.

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:14.692
AND ECC THE DANGER IS GOING TO

00:38:14.759 --> 00:38:16.160
OCCUR HERE BECAUSE BORROWERS ARE

00:38:16.227 --> 00:38:17.595
GOING TO BE COMPARING DIFFERENT

00:38:17.662 --> 00:38:22.099
PRODUCTS ONE COULD WITH A PR AND

00:38:22.166 --> 00:38:23.267
ONE ACC.

00:38:23.334 --> 00:38:24.669
LOTS OF THINGS ARE STILL GOING

00:38:24.735 --> 00:38:25.970
TO BE QUITE AND APR THE SCHUMER

00:38:26.037 --> 00:38:27.138
BOX IN YOUR CREDIT CARD IS STILL

00:38:27.204 --> 00:38:27.605
GOING TO HAVE A PR.

00:38:27.672 --> 00:38:29.106
AND I CAN TELL YOU THE CREDIT

00:38:29.173 --> 00:38:29.774
THAT --

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:34.278
SMALL BUSINESS CUSTOMERS ORGANIC.

00:38:34.345 --> 00:38:36.313
P. R. THIRTY THREE THE ONE THAT

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:39.517
SAYS THIS AND IT'S JUST LOWER

00:38:39.583 --> 00:38:40.151
IT'S LIKE BUYING THE CINNABAR

00:38:40.217 --> 00:38:40.985
UNDERTAKEN SUDDENLY YOU'RE GONNA

00:38:41.052 --> 00:38:43.688
PICK THE ONE THAT LOOKS LOWER --

00:38:43.754 --> 00:38:45.890
EVEN THOUGH IN FACT IT'S NOT.

00:38:45.956 --> 00:38:47.224
THE ACTUALLY LESS EXPENSIVE

00:38:47.291 --> 00:38:49.060
PRODUCT IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT

00:38:49.126 --> 00:38:51.062
METRIC ENTIRELY --

00:38:51.128 --> 00:38:52.897
SO THE PROBLEM IS GOING TO I

00:38:52.963 --> 00:38:53.998
THINK NOT GO AWAY OVER TIME WITH

00:38:54.065 --> 00:38:55.199
THIS BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO

00:38:55.266 --> 00:38:57.334
CONTINUE TO LIVE IN AN ECOSYSTEM.

00:38:57.401 --> 00:38:59.804
WHERE APR REMAINS?

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:01.338
YOU KNOW THE PROMINENT METRICS

00:39:01.405 --> 00:39:02.606
SO PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE TRYING

00:39:02.673 --> 00:39:03.841
TO REALLY DOING APPLES TO

00:39:03.908 --> 00:39:06.844
ORANGES COMPARISONS BETWEEN APR

00:39:06.911 --> 00:39:07.878
AN ECC.

00:39:07.945 --> 00:39:09.380
ACROSS THIS ISN'T ACTUALLY JUST

00:39:09.447 --> 00:39:11.115
SPECULATION ON WE'D SPENT I

00:39:11.182 --> 00:39:11.816
THINK I MENTIONED A LOT OF

00:39:11.882 --> 00:39:12.750
HOMEWORK WHEN WE DEVELOPED SMART

00:39:12.817 --> 00:39:14.085
BOX.

00:39:14.151 --> 00:39:15.486
OVER EIGHTEEN MONTHS ONE OF

00:39:15.553 --> 00:39:16.654
THINGS WE DID IS ACTUALLY

00:39:16.721 --> 00:39:18.255
CONSIDERED PUTTING A SECOND

00:39:18.322 --> 00:39:20.624
PERCENTAGE METRIC THE AIR INTO

00:39:20.691 --> 00:39:21.625
THE SMART BOX THAT WOULD HAVE

00:39:21.692 --> 00:39:21.959
HAD.

00:39:22.026 --> 00:39:24.361
WHEN MORE PERCENTAGE HERE AND

00:39:24.428 --> 00:39:25.496
WHEN WE SHARED THAT WITH SMALL

00:39:25.563 --> 00:39:26.630
BUSINESS CUSTOMERS IT

00:39:26.697 --> 00:39:27.965
IMMEDIATELY CAUSE CONFUSION

00:39:28.032 --> 00:39:30.434
THERE LIKE WHICH ONE'S THE REAL?

00:39:30.501 --> 00:39:32.002
ONE WHICH ONE IS THE RIGHT ONE

00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:34.572
AND SO IT JUST LED TO A TONIC

00:39:34.638 --> 00:39:35.172
QUESTIONS AND SO WE ULTIMATELY

00:39:35.239 --> 00:39:36.107
SAID.

00:39:36.173 --> 00:39:37.842
ONLY ONE PERCENTAGE BASED METRIC

00:39:37.908 --> 00:39:39.610
ON THIS BECAUSE IT'S JUST GOING

00:39:39.677 --> 00:39:41.445
TO CONFUSE PEOPLE.

00:39:41.512 --> 00:39:43.414
AND SO I THINK THE CONCERN FOR

00:39:43.481 --> 00:39:46.083
US IS THAT WHERE YOU ARE NOW IN

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:47.418
A POSITION AS THE AISLE PSA.

00:39:47.485 --> 00:39:50.054
OF HAVING TO DROP APR ENTIRELY

00:39:50.121 --> 00:39:51.622
AND REPLACED IT WITH THE THIS

00:39:51.689 --> 00:39:53.023
NEW METRIC WHICH IS UNTESTED

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:54.091
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE I DON'T

00:39:54.158 --> 00:39:56.026
KNOW ANYONE WHO'S EVER USED IT I

00:39:56.093 --> 00:39:56.627
DON'T KNOW IF THERE BEEN ANY

00:39:56.694 --> 00:39:57.194
STUDIES.

00:39:57.261 --> 00:39:58.996
ON WHETHER OR NOT IT ACTUALLY

00:39:59.063 --> 00:40:00.564
KIND OF WORKS OVERTIME.

00:40:00.631 --> 00:40:01.632
SO WE REALLY COULDN'T REPLACE IT

00:40:01.699 --> 00:40:03.000
OR WE CAN GO BACK TO SITUATION

00:40:03.067 --> 00:40:03.868
WHERE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO

00:40:03.934 --> 00:40:05.836
HAVE TO PERCENTAGES ON THE SMART

00:40:05.903 --> 00:40:06.637
BOX AGAIN.

00:40:06.704 --> 00:40:08.239
WHICH WE KNOW BASED ON OUR OWN

00:40:08.305 --> 00:40:11.675
BACK DOES CAUSE CONFUSION FOR

00:40:11.742 --> 00:40:13.043
PEOPLE SO WE CLOSING.

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:14.779
WE SUPPORT THE CONCEPT HERE AYE

00:40:14.845 --> 00:40:16.614
WE BELIEVE IN TRANSPARENCY AND

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:17.882
DISCLOSURE BUT WE ARE VERY

00:40:17.948 --> 00:40:19.650
CONCERNED THAT THIS MATTER WILL

00:40:19.717 --> 00:40:20.985
BE CONFUSING FOR PEOPLE

00:40:21.051 --> 00:40:23.187
INHABITING THREE QUESTIONS.

00:40:23.254 --> 00:40:23.988

OF S. B. TWELVE THIRTY FIVE

00:40:54.852 --> 00:40:55.619
EXCEPT.

00:40:55.686 --> 00:40:56.887
FOR ONE THAT IS THE ESTIMATED

00:40:56.954 --> 00:40:57.988
ANALYZE COST OF CAPITAL

DISCLOSURE. FOR CLARITY WE DO

00:41:01.458 --> 00:41:04.195
NOT OPPOSE DISCLOSURE INSTEAD

00:41:04.261 --> 00:41:05.229
WE'RE ADVOCATING FOR AN

DISCLOSURE.

00:41:08.165 --> 00:41:09.066
OUR CONCERN IS THAT REQUIRING

00:41:09.133 --> 00:41:10.634
ANY ANALYZE PERCENTAGE FOR

00:41:10.701 --> 00:41:13.504
FINANCING THAT IS NOT ALONE.

00:41:13.571 --> 00:41:14.638
WILL MISS CHARACTERIZE THE

00:41:14.705 --> 00:41:17.808
UNDERLYING TRANSACTION AND

00:41:17.875 --> 00:41:19.543
SENATOR GLAZERS BILL RECOGNIZES

00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:21.312
THAT REQUIRING AN ESTIMATED

ANALYZE COST OF CAPITAL

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:24.615
DISCLOSURE DOES NOT MAKE SENSE

00:41:24.682 --> 00:41:26.784
FOR OTHER NON LOAN PRODUCTS.

00:41:26.851 --> 00:41:27.918
SO JUST COMMERCIAL LEASING OR

00:41:27.985 --> 00:41:30.354
INVOICE FACTORING.

00:41:30.421 --> 00:41:31.622
COMMERCIAL LEASING IS COMPLETELY

00:41:31.689 --> 00:41:34.325
EXEMPT FROM S. B..

00:41:34.391 --> 00:41:35.059
TWELVE THIRTY FIVE AND INVOICE

ANALYZE COST OF CAPITAL

00:41:37.261 --> 00:41:39.597
DISCLOSURE.

00:41:39.663 --> 00:41:40.464
THAT IS BECAUSE COMMERCIAL

00:41:40.531 --> 00:41:41.665
LEASING AN INVOICE FACTORING ARE

00:41:41.732 --> 00:41:44.034
NOT LOANS.

00:41:44.101 --> 00:41:45.803
BUT S. B. TWELVE THIRTY FIVE

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:47.071
PROPOSES TO REQUIRE AN

00:41:47.137 --> 00:41:48.806
ANNUALIZED ACOSTA CAPITAL

00:41:48.873 --> 00:41:50.541
DISCLOSURE FOR FUTURE

00:41:50.608 --> 00:41:52.076
RECEIVABLES FACTORING.

00:41:52.142 --> 00:41:53.611
ALSO NOT ALONE.

00:41:53.677 --> 00:41:55.913
THIS IS A LOGICAL.

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:57.781
FUTURES HE WILL SPECTRUM IS

00:41:57.848 --> 00:41:58.349
FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM

00:41:58.415 --> 00:41:59.617
ALONE.

00:41:59.683 --> 00:42:00.918
THE BUSINESS PART PAYS ONLY A

00:42:00.985 --> 00:42:03.254
PERCENTAGE OF ITS RECEIVABLES

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:05.055
FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WILDFIRES SWEPT

00:42:05.122 --> 00:42:06.891
ACROSS CALIFORNIA LAST FALL A

00:42:06.957 --> 00:42:08.859
BUSINESS THAT WAS DAMAGED THEY

00:42:08.926 --> 00:42:09.426
COULD NOT OPERATE WOULD OWE

00:42:09.493 --> 00:42:11.462
NOTHING.

00:42:11.528 --> 00:42:12.963
BECAUSE THE TRANSACTION IS NOT%

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:15.165
ALONE ANY APR OR ANALYZE COST OF

00:42:15.232 --> 00:42:16.667
CAPITAL DISCLOSURE WHICH WOULD

00:42:16.734 --> 00:42:18.202
ONLY CONFUSE AND MISLEAD SMALL

00:42:18.269 --> 00:42:20.137
BUSINESS OWNERS.

00:42:20.204 --> 00:42:21.138
I'M VERY OPTIMISTIC THAT

00:42:21.205 --> 00:42:22.539
CALIFORNIA CAN LEAD THE WAY IN

00:42:22.606 --> 00:42:23.674
PROVIDING BUSINESSES WITH

00:42:23.741 --> 00:42:25.342
DISCLOSURES THAT ARE HOPEFUL AND

00:42:25.409 --> 00:42:27.444
NOT MISLEADING. FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:42:27.511 --> 00:42:30.381
DISCLOSURE AYE IN SP TWELVE

00:42:30.447 --> 00:42:30.981

WAS SOUND LIKE HE WAS APPLES AND

00:43:04.882 --> 00:43:06.016
ORANGES.

SO AS LONG AS THE CONSUMER OR IN

00:43:09.553 --> 00:43:11.522
THIS PARTICULAR CASE THE THE

00:43:11.588 --> 00:43:12.690
BUSINESS OWNER THAT WASN'T

00:43:12.756 --> 00:43:14.291
SEEKING A COMMERCIAL LOAN.

00:43:14.358 --> 00:43:16.260
WAS AWARE THAT --

00:43:16.327 --> 00:43:18.062
THEY WERE APPLES AND ORANGES

00:43:18.128 --> 00:43:19.129
THEN THIS LONG AS THEY WERE

00:43:19.196 --> 00:43:20.497
ALIGNING THE APPLES TOGETHER OR

00:43:20.564 --> 00:43:21.865
THE ORANGES TOGETHER.

00:43:21.932 --> 00:43:24.201
AND COMPARING THE RIGHT RATES

00:43:24.268 --> 00:43:26.270
THEN IT WOULD.

00:43:26.337 --> 00:43:27.137
THERE WOULD BE CONFUSION IS THAT

00:43:27.204 --> 00:43:28.138
RIGHT [inaudible]

00:43:28.205 --> 00:43:31.375
THAT IF.

00:43:31.442 --> 00:43:32.409
FORGOT PASSED THE SIMILARITIES

00:43:32.476 --> 00:43:33.877
BETWEEN THEM AND ACTUALLY SORT

00:43:33.944 --> 00:43:34.745
OF DIE AGAIN --

00:43:34.812 --> 00:43:36.513
THEY COULD POTENTIALLY SEC ACC

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:38.749
IS FORM IS BASICALLY COMPUTER

00:43:38.816 --> 00:43:40.150
COMPLETELY DIFFERENTLY AND IS IT

00:43:40.217 --> 00:43:41.185
SIGNED TO BE A DIFFERENT METRIC.

00:43:41.251 --> 00:43:43.120
I THINK THE HARD PART IS WHEN

00:43:43.187 --> 00:43:44.421
YOU JUST SEE IF YOUR ACC WE'VE

00:43:44.488 --> 00:43:46.457
SEE RATES PEOPLE ARE MAKING

00:43:46.523 --> 00:43:47.992
QUICK DECISIONS AND I THINK

00:43:48.058 --> 00:43:50.894
THEY'RE GOING TO SEE. 36% 23%

00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:52.262
AND JUST.

00:43:52.329 --> 00:43:53.430
GO WITH THAT WHEN THE OTHER

00:43:53.497 --> 00:43:54.598
THINGS I THINK THAT'S

00:43:54.665 --> 00:43:56.300
PROBLEMATIC HERE IS THAT THE

00:43:56.367 --> 00:43:57.901
UNDERLYING DIFFERENCES I WON'T

00:43:57.968 --> 00:43:59.503
EVEN BEGIN TO TRY TO EXPLAIN

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:01.605
BECAUSE TRYING TO SAY WHICH

00:44:01.672 --> 00:44:02.172
WOULD WE KNOW.

00:44:02.239 --> 00:44:04.641
TRYING TO SAY WITH Y. APR IS IS

00:44:04.708 --> 00:44:06.110
COMPUTED ONE WAY AND Y. ACC'S

00:44:06.176 --> 00:44:07.444
COMPUTER THE OTHER WAY.

00:44:07.511 --> 00:44:08.912
IS GOING TO BE COMPLICATED AND

00:44:08.979 --> 00:44:10.047
TAKE UP A LOT OF TIME ON THE

00:44:10.114 --> 00:44:10.814
PHONE WHERE PEOPLE TRY TO

00:44:10.881 --> 00:44:12.750
UNDERSTAND WHICH ONE'S THE REAL

00:44:12.816 --> 00:44:13.517
ONE THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE

00:44:13.584 --> 00:44:14.218
LOOKING AT.

00:44:14.284 --> 00:44:16.553
SHIRT SO IF WE WERE COMPARING

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:17.788
PRODUCTS.

00:44:17.855 --> 00:44:21.992
WHETHER THAT PRODUCT IF FROM --

00:44:22.059 --> 00:44:23.927
THREE TO WAS USING A P. ARE.

00:44:23.994 --> 00:44:24.795
THAT I WOULD HAVE A FAIR

00:44:24.862 --> 00:44:26.196
COMPARISON BETWEEN.

00:44:26.263 --> 00:44:28.599
SO IF I HAD ALL THREE PROVIDERS

00:44:28.665 --> 00:44:31.301
ALSO PROVIDING AN A CC.

00:44:31.368 --> 00:44:32.469

00:44:32.536 --> 00:44:34.238
STRICTLY AMONGST STCC THERE

00:44:34.304 --> 00:44:35.539
WOULD BE A FAIR COMPARISON IT

00:44:35.606 --> 00:44:36.273
WOULD BE AND I THINK THE

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:38.108
CHALLENGE THAT THEY WILL HAVE IT

00:44:38.175 --> 00:44:39.710
DOING STRAIGHT UP IN RENO REAL

GOING TO BE.

00:44:42.613 --> 00:44:44.081

00:48:49.259 --> 00:48:50.694
YOU KNOW AND DID A SURVEY OF

00:48:50.761 --> 00:48:51.995
SMALL BUSINESSES PART OF THAT

00:48:52.062 --> 00:48:53.130
TOTAL COST OF CAPITAL WAS

00:48:53.196 --> 00:48:54.431
SOMETHING WE DOLLARS AND DOLLARS

00:48:54.498 --> 00:48:56.233
OUT THE IN THE DAY THAT IS WHAT

00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:57.467
IS MOST MEANINGFUL TO THEM I'M

00:48:57.534 --> 00:48:58.735
NOT SUGGESTING YOU KNOW ANALYZE

00:48:58.802 --> 00:48:59.736
METRIC OR WHATEVER.

00:48:59.803 --> 00:49:01.338
THE PROBLEM WITH ANALYZE METRICS

00:49:01.405 --> 00:49:03.173
GENERALLY IS THAT THE SHORTER

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:04.241
THE TERM OF THE LOAN THEY JUST

00:49:04.308 --> 00:49:05.676
LOOK A LOT IT THIS STARTS TO

00:49:05.742 --> 00:49:07.544
FALL APART AND PER YEAR --

00:49:07.611 --> 00:49:10.447
BUT I BUT TO THE POINT THAT THAT

00:49:10.514 --> 00:49:11.715
THAT YOU MADE THAT BOTTLE OF

00:49:11.782 --> 00:49:12.616
CAPITAL IS SOMETHING THAT

00:49:12.683 --> 00:49:16.553
BUSINESS OWNER SAY IS THE METRIC

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:17.154
IT'S WHITES AT THE TOP OF OUR

00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:19.156
SMALL BOX [inaudible]

00:49:19.222 --> 00:49:21.725
ASSEMBLYMEMBER WEBER.

00:49:21.792 --> 00:49:24.094
JUST WANTED TO GET SOME CLARITY --

00:49:24.161 --> 00:49:27.764
NOW THIS SMART BOX THAT YOU HAVE --

00:49:27.831 --> 00:49:29.333
HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD THE SMART

00:49:29.399 --> 00:49:31.435
BOTTOM IS A SOMETHING THAT SMALL

00:49:31.501 --> 00:49:33.303
BUSINESSES HAVE ACCESS TO WOULD

00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:35.305
HAVE TO YEARS OR SOMETHING NEW

00:49:35.372 --> 00:49:38.275
WE LAUNCHED A IN JUNE OF TWO

00:49:38.342 --> 00:49:38.875
THOUSAND SIXTEEN SO IT'S BEEN

00:49:38.942 --> 00:49:39.509
AROUND FOR TWO YEARS?

00:49:39.576 --> 00:49:40.977
OKAY EN AND BUT IT'S NOT

00:49:41.044 --> 00:49:43.046
REQUIRED IS NOT IT'S A VOLUNTARY

00:49:43.113 --> 00:49:45.816
INDUSTRY MODEL ANYBODY WHO JOINS

00:49:45.882 --> 00:49:47.317
I'LL PA MUST DISCLOSE THAT AS

00:49:47.384 --> 00:49:48.652
PART OF THAT MEMBERSHIP SO.

00:49:48.719 --> 00:49:49.920
YOU HAVE SOME OF THE LARGER

00:49:49.986 --> 00:49:51.421
LANDERS LIKE ON TECH AND CABBAGE

00:49:51.488 --> 00:49:53.457
USING IT ON BUT IT IS NOT

00:49:53.523 --> 00:49:55.692
MANDATORY IS NOT MADE BY THE

00:49:55.759 --> 00:49:55.992
GOVERNMENT.

00:49:56.059 --> 00:49:56.460
HUMPIN.

00:49:56.526 --> 00:49:57.561
OKAY SO THEREFORE IT'S KIND OF

00:49:57.627 --> 00:49:59.262
AN UN EVEN THING IN TERMS OF WHO

00:49:59.329 --> 00:50:00.897
HAS ACCESS TO IT WITH THAT

00:50:00.964 --> 00:50:02.432
PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THE REAL COST

00:50:02.499 --> 00:50:03.834
OF THEIR LOANS ARE YEAH.

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:06.870
THERE'S NOT THERE'S NO MANDATE

00:50:06.937 --> 00:50:08.071
TO MAKE THESE DISCLOSURES

00:50:08.138 --> 00:50:08.905
CONTENT AND THE INDUSTRY

00:50:08.972 --> 00:50:10.374
INITIALLY WAS A POST APR.

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:10.941
AND I ASSUME WE STILL ARE I

00:50:11.007 --> 00:50:13.910
WOULD IMAGINE.

00:50:13.977 --> 00:50:16.546
HASTHERE BEEN SOME REVELATION

00:50:16.613 --> 00:50:18.715
EVERY.

00:50:18.782 --> 00:50:19.750
IT IS OF THE COMPANIES THAT

00:50:19.816 --> 00:50:21.585
FINANCING COMPANIES THAT DON'T

00:50:21.651 --> 00:50:23.453
OFFER LOANS BUT OFFER A TYPE OF

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:25.088
FACT DREAM PROGRAM.

00:50:25.155 --> 00:50:27.224
SO THEY ARE OPPOSED TO ANY TYPE

00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:29.092
OF ANALYZE METRIC BECAUSE THOSE

00:50:29.159 --> 00:50:30.627
TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS DON'T HAVE

00:50:30.694 --> 00:50:31.428
A TERM.

00:50:31.495 --> 00:50:34.498
BUT THE THE BUSINESS ONLY PAYS A

00:50:34.564 --> 00:50:35.899
PERCENTAGE OF ITS REVENUE AS

00:50:35.966 --> 00:50:37.434
THAT REVENUES CREATED.

00:50:37.501 --> 00:50:40.036
SO THAT THE TRANSACTION WILL

00:50:40.103 --> 00:50:41.605
TAKE AS LONG AS IT TAKES AS LONG

00:50:41.671 --> 00:50:43.140
AS IT TAKES A BUSINESS TO

00:50:43.206 --> 00:50:44.641
GENERATE THE REVENUE.

00:50:44.708 --> 00:50:45.609
THAT THEY WILL THEN DELIVER TO

00:50:45.675 --> 00:50:50.547
THE COMPANY --

00:50:50.614 --> 00:50:52.682
AND I ASSUME THAT ANY NEW SYSTEM

00:50:52.749 --> 00:50:53.717
THAT YOU COME UP WITH WILL BE

00:50:53.784 --> 00:50:55.085
UNTESTED I MEAN THAT'S THE

00:50:55.152 --> 00:50:56.653
NATURE OF SOME NEW --

00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.188
IF IT DOES NOT IT WOULD BE OLD

00:50:58.255 --> 00:50:59.589
RATHER THAN.

00:50:59.656 --> 00:51:00.891
IT BEING SOMETHING NEW SOME NOT

00:51:00.957 --> 00:51:02.259
NECESSARY PERSUADED BY THE

00:51:02.325 --> 00:51:03.827
UNTESTED ELEMENT OF THAT.

00:51:03.894 --> 00:51:04.828
I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE SOME

00:51:04.895 --> 00:51:07.197
TRANSPARENT OUT THAT MUCH

00:51:07.264 --> 00:51:08.632
TRANSPARENCY IN TERMS OF

00:51:08.698 --> 00:51:10.200
COMMERCIAL LOANS I JUST ASSUME

00:51:10.267 --> 00:51:12.235
EVERYBODY HIT TRANSPARENCY IN

00:51:12.302 --> 00:51:14.171
NEW WITH IT ALONE COST AND AND

00:51:14.237 --> 00:51:15.038
SO I FOUND IT.

00:51:15.105 --> 00:51:16.506
RATHER INCREDIBLE THAT THAT IT

00:51:16.573 --> 00:51:18.208
DIDN'T HAPPEN NOT SURE I'M

00:51:18.275 --> 00:51:20.477
CONVINCED ACC IS THE BEST THING

00:51:20.544 --> 00:51:21.244
BUT I AM HURTING BY TELL ME

00:51:21.311 --> 00:51:22.345
THING ELSE.

00:51:22.412 --> 00:51:23.513
I KNOW PEOPLE DON'T LIKE A PR

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:25.315
VOTE MUCH BUT I THINK THAT HER

00:51:25.382 --> 00:51:26.550
THAT ACC SO HORRIBLE.

00:51:26.616 --> 00:51:27.884
I'M PROBABLY GOING TO SUPPORT

00:51:27.951 --> 00:51:29.419
THIS AS IT GOES FORWARD WITH

00:51:29.486 --> 00:51:30.921

BECAUSE I THINK IT IS VERY

00:51:40.263 --> 00:51:41.097
IMPORTANT.

00:51:41.164 --> 00:51:42.332

IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME TO VOTE

00:55:40.737 --> 00:55:42.539
FOR SOMETHING THAT SAYS THAT

00:55:42.605 --> 00:55:43.707
WHAT IT SAYS HERE IN TERMS OF

00:55:43.773 --> 00:55:44.340
HAVING.

00:55:44.407 --> 00:55:45.442

TO REGULATE AND DIE AND THE

00:56:06.396 --> 00:56:07.931
THING THAT WE HAVE IN OUR

00:56:07.997 --> 00:56:09.833

00:56:09.899 --> 00:56:10.834
THAT WE'D RATHER START WITH THE

00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:12.402
STEP OF DISCLOSURE AND NOT

00:56:12.469 --> 00:56:14.037
LICENSING AND NOT REGULATION IN

00:56:14.104 --> 00:56:15.338
THE HOPE WOULD BE THAT THE

00:56:15.405 --> 00:56:16.673
MARKETPLACE CAN ACT

AYE AND THAT CAN BE THE END OF

00:56:20.343 --> 00:56:20.710
IT.

00:56:20.777 --> 00:56:22.545
UP BUT UNDER CURRENT LAW IF YOU

OFFICERS HAVE THAT SAME ABILITY

00:56:33.156 --> 00:56:34.290
IF THEY CITY.

00:56:34.357 --> 00:56:36.793
OF VIOLATIONS THAT TO ENGAGE IS

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:38.394
APPROPRIATE ITSELF SO.

THE EXCEPTION OF REGULATION?

00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:49.572
AND I IT WAS MY VIEW THAT I

00:56:49.639 --> 00:56:50.507
COULD YOU GET FOLKS FROM ALL

00:56:50.573 --> 00:56:51.908
SIDES ON THESE KINDS OF THINGS

00:56:51.975 --> 00:56:52.575
AND IT IS IT.

00:56:52.642 --> 00:56:54.110
IT'S IT'S A NEW --

00:56:54.177 --> 00:56:55.278
ENGAGEMENT BECAUSE IT IS THE

00:56:55.345 --> 00:56:56.813
WILD WEST TODAY.

00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:57.680
THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT THAT WE

00:56:57.747 --> 00:57:00.884
HEARD FROM WHAT SHE DOES THIS

00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:03.019
AND THEY DO THAT THERE IS NO

00:57:03.086 --> 00:57:04.354
REQUIREMENTS ANYWHERE IN THIS

00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:05.688
SPACE -- IN

00:57:05.755 --> 00:57:08.191
CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE COUNTRY --

00:57:08.258 --> 00:57:10.760
AND SO IT WAS AT IT THAT CONTEXT

00:57:10.827 --> 00:57:11.594
THAT I SEE THAT MY FEELING WAS

00:57:11.661 --> 00:57:11.895
[inaudible]

00:57:11.961 --> 00:57:14.564
I AND WE TOOK A LOT OF

00:57:14.631 --> 00:57:15.799
AMENDMENTS TO NARROW THIS BILL I

00:57:15.865 --> 00:57:16.232
CAN GO THROUGH THOSE

00:57:16.299 --> 00:57:16.533
[inaudible]

00:57:16.599 --> 00:57:19.035
I HAVE THE FIRST STEP SHOULD BE

00:57:19.102 --> 00:57:21.604
A SIMPLE DISCLOSURE MECHANISM --

00:57:21.671 --> 00:57:23.506
WITH THE SUNSET.

00:57:23.573 --> 00:57:25.141
AND THAT WE CAN EVALUATE IT AS

00:57:25.208 --> 00:57:26.409
IT GOES I DON'T WANT TO CURTAIL

00:57:26.476 --> 00:57:28.778
THE LENDING MARKET WHATSOEVER --

00:57:28.845 --> 00:57:30.380
BUT IF WE HAVE BAD ACTORS THAT

00:57:30.446 --> 00:57:31.815
CONTINUE DID NOT FOLLOW THOSE

00:57:31.881 --> 00:57:33.583
RULES THAT I'M VERY OPEN TO

00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:34.517
TRYING TO SEE WHAT ELSE IS WAS

00:57:34.584 --> 00:57:35.685
REQUIRED AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE

00:57:35.752 --> 00:57:36.920
TAKEN A SMALL STEP TODAY THAT

00:57:36.986 --> 00:57:38.354
YOU SEE IN FRONT OF YOU.

00:57:38.421 --> 00:57:39.622
SO YOU'RE YEAR THIS IS NOT A

00:57:39.689 --> 00:57:40.990
MATTER OF THIS WILL BE ADDRESSED

00:57:41.057 --> 00:57:42.559
IN A FUTURE COMMITTEE OR BEFORE

00:57:42.625 --> 00:57:44.394
COMES TO THE FLOOR AIDS IT IS

00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:46.229
THE INTENT TO TO LEAVE IT --

00:57:46.296 --> 00:57:47.397
SORT OF OPEN AT LEAST AT THIS

00:57:47.463 --> 00:57:49.132
POINT AGAIN GIVEN THAT VARIOUS

00:57:49.199 --> 00:57:50.433
PLAYERS IN THIS IN THE IN THE

00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:52.569
SPACE --

00:57:52.635 --> 00:57:53.303
THAT THE SMALLER STEP TO ME

00:57:53.369 --> 00:57:54.604
WOULD SEEM TO BE THE MORE

00:57:54.671 --> 00:57:56.239
APPROPRIATE STEP NO IT IS NOT MY

00:57:56.306 --> 00:57:57.307
INTENTION TO PUT A NEW

00:57:57.373 --> 00:57:59.075
REGULATORY.

00:57:59.142 --> 00:58:00.577
I FRAMEWORK UNDER THIS BILL I

00:58:00.643 --> 00:58:01.578
THINK THAT MAKES IT MORE

00:58:01.644 --> 00:58:02.912
DIFFICULT AND LISTEN.

00:58:02.979 --> 00:58:04.347
WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPPOSITION

00:58:04.414 --> 00:58:06.316
APR OF FROM THE START WE MIGHT

00:58:06.382 --> 00:58:07.851
BE A DIFFERENT PLACE TODAY BUT I

00:58:07.917 --> 00:58:09.052
TRY TO ACCOMMODATE.

00:58:09.118 --> 00:58:11.254
A OPPOSITION AND THAT'S WHY YOU

00:58:11.321 --> 00:58:11.888
HAVE THE NARROWNESS OF THIS BILL

00:58:11.955 --> 00:58:14.324
BEFORE YOU.

00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:17.627
I'M OKAY THANK YOU.

A SOMBER TALES ELECTRIC.

00:58:19.195 --> 00:58:20.630
AND I'M OBVIOUSLY I DON'T KNOW

00:58:20.697 --> 00:58:21.264
WHAT THE OPPOSITION WAS TAPE PR

00:58:21.331 --> 00:58:23.766
ALL OF THIS IS NEW TO ME AND

00:58:23.833 --> 00:58:25.368
FAIRLY NEW TO THIS COMMITTEE BUT

00:58:25.435 --> 00:58:27.704
I AM CONCERNED --

00:58:27.770 --> 00:58:29.505
WITH KIND OF I DON'T SAY

00:58:29.572 --> 00:58:31.274
UNSOPHISTICATED BUT YOU KNOW MY

00:58:31.341 --> 00:58:33.409
FATHER HAS HAD SMALL BUSINESSES

00:58:33.476 --> 00:58:35.245
AND HAS MADE DETERMINATIONS

00:58:35.311 --> 00:58:36.980
WHETHER HE PUT SOMETHING ON A

00:58:37.046 --> 00:58:39.215
CREDIT CARD VERSUS TAKES OUT

00:58:39.282 --> 00:58:40.650
SOME SORT OF LOAN --

00:58:40.717 --> 00:58:42.452
WHAT?

00:58:42.518 --> 00:58:44.621
IS THE ACC ALWAYS GOING TO BE

00:58:44.687 --> 00:58:47.490
SMALLER THAN THE A PR I I REALLY

00:58:47.557 --> 00:58:49.158
KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THESE THINGS.

00:58:49.225 --> 00:58:50.493
IT DEPENDS ON THE DURATION --

00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:54.664
AT IT IT'S IT'S IT'S MEANT TO

00:58:54.731 --> 00:58:55.565
SAY OVER TWELVE MONTHS THAT

00:58:55.632 --> 00:58:57.066
WOULD SEE THERE'S A LOT OF LOANS

00:58:57.133 --> 00:58:57.700
IN THIS IS PART OF THE PROBLEM

00:58:57.767 --> 00:59:00.470
THAT SPACES I STATE YOU NEED A

00:59:00.536 --> 00:59:01.037

GIVE YOU A THOUSAND DOLLARS A

00:59:06.042 --> 00:59:07.777
COST YOU TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS IN

00:59:07.844 --> 00:59:08.478
THIS IS WHAT THE OPPOSITION SAID

00:59:08.544 --> 00:59:08.878
THAT.

00:59:08.945 --> 00:59:09.946
SMALL VISIT PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW

00:59:10.013 --> 00:59:11.714
WHAT THAT TOTAL COSTS WELL IT'S

00:59:11.781 --> 00:59:13.683
TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. TO GET A

00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:14.717
THOUSAND DOLLARS NOW AND YOU

00:59:14.784 --> 00:59:16.386
HAVE TO PAY IT BACK WHEN.

00:59:16.452 --> 00:59:17.921
WILL HE HAVE TO PAY IT BACK IN

00:59:17.987 --> 00:59:19.389
NINETY DAYS THAT INTEREST RATE

00:59:19.455 --> 00:59:21.124
THAT YOUR PAIN IS GONNA BE A LOT

00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:22.225
HIGHER THAN YOU CAN THAT PAID

00:59:22.292 --> 00:59:23.526

OR HE PAID IT BACK BASED ON

00:59:25.194 --> 00:59:26.496
TAKING A PENNY OUT OF EVERY

00:59:26.562 --> 00:59:28.398
CREDIT CARD TRANSACTION.

00:59:28.464 --> 00:59:29.632
I THINK SO WHEN THESE LENDERS

00:59:29.699 --> 00:59:30.667
COMMAND THEY CAN OFFER YOU THIS

00:59:30.733 --> 00:59:33.269
WIDE ARRAY OF WAYS IN WHICH IT'S

00:59:33.336 --> 00:59:34.137
NOT GONNA COST YOU ANYTHING TO

00:59:34.203 --> 00:59:35.538
YOUR DAD.

00:59:35.605 --> 00:59:36.039
I'M AND THAT'S BEEN THE

00:59:36.105 --> 00:59:38.775
CHALLENGE THAT THE ISSUE OF THAT

00:59:38.841 --> 00:59:40.310
THE ANNUALIZED COST OF CAPITAL

00:59:40.376 --> 00:59:41.110
TO SAY WHETHER YOU TAKE THAT

00:59:41.177 --> 00:59:42.712
LOAN FOR NINETY DAYS OR FOR TWO

00:59:42.779 --> 00:59:43.947
YEARS.

00:59:44.013 --> 00:59:46.149
YOU HAVE A AN ANNUALIZED COSTS

00:59:46.215 --> 00:59:48.084
AS IF IT WAS FOR TWELVE MONTHS.

00:59:48.151 --> 00:59:49.485
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE KNOWING

00:59:49.552 --> 00:59:50.987
HOW MUCH IT'S GOING TO COST YOU.

00:59:51.054 --> 00:59:52.588
YOU CAN SHOP THE NEXT VENDOR AND

00:59:52.655 --> 00:59:54.190
THE NEXT FINANCIER AND HAVE AN

00:59:54.257 --> 00:59:55.291
APPLES TO APPLES TO COMPARE IT

00:59:55.358 --> 00:59:58.328
TO BECAUSE ONE VENDOR MAY SAKE

00:59:58.394 --> 01:00:00.296
PAY ME UP PAY ME IN SIX MONTHS.

01:00:00.363 --> 01:00:01.564
ANOTHER ONE WILL SAY WILL

01:00:01.631 --> 01:00:02.231
EIGHTEEN MONTHS WELL WHAT'S THE

01:00:02.298 --> 01:00:03.566
DIFFERENCE AND SO THAT

01:00:03.633 --> 01:00:05.601
ANNUALIZED COST AS A WAY TO HAVE

01:00:05.668 --> 01:00:07.036
THAT ONE STANDARD.

01:00:07.103 --> 01:00:08.271
REVIEW WHEN WE I DID DO A CHART

01:00:08.338 --> 01:00:09.405
HERE.

01:00:09.472 --> 01:00:10.707
I THINK IF YOU A SENSE OF THESE

01:00:10.773 --> 01:00:12.008
OF THE STANDARDS REQUIRED BY THE

01:00:12.075 --> 01:00:13.009
BILL.

01:00:13.076 --> 01:00:14.444
AND AT THE BOTTOM OF IT SAYS

01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:15.979
WHAT'S THE ANNUALIZED COST OF

01:00:16.045 --> 01:00:17.246
CAPITAL YOU HAVE A WAY OF

01:00:17.313 --> 01:00:18.047
REVEALING THAT THIS.

01:00:18.114 --> 01:00:20.083
THIS CHART IS BASED THOUSAND

01:00:20.149 --> 01:00:22.318
DOLLARS ONE TIME.

01:00:22.385 --> 01:00:23.953
OVER THE PERIOD OF TIME AND SO

AND YOU CAN SEE HOW THESE CHARTS

01:01:57.513 --> 01:01:59.248
THAT WORK OUT.

01:01:59.315 --> 01:02:00.049
UNDER THIS ONE IT'S A HUNDRED

01:02:00.116 --> 01:02:00.883

TWENTY NINE THOUSAND HERE'S HOW

01:02:14.163 --> 01:02:14.864
MUCH YOU PAID EVERY DAY IF

01:02:14.931 --> 01:02:17.166
WHAT'S MOST SENSITIVE YOUR DAD

01:02:17.233 --> 01:02:17.800
WAS HOW MUCH HE HAD TO PUT OUT

01:02:17.867 --> 01:02:19.001

AND SIXTY THREE DOLLARS.

01:02:23.072 --> 01:02:24.440
AND SO YOU WORK DOWN THIS CHART

01:02:24.507 --> 01:02:25.274
AND THEN YOU SAY WELL WHAT IF I

01:02:25.341 --> 01:02:26.709
HAD TO PAY THIS OVER ONE YEAR

01:02:26.776 --> 01:02:28.344

THIS IS A 10% COST AND THAT ONCE

01:02:30.713 --> 01:02:32.448
THE 6% COST BUT YOU GET A SENSE

01:02:32.515 --> 01:02:34.917
OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THESE JUST

01:02:34.984 --> 01:02:35.685
TWO DIFFERENT EXAMPLES OF FLAT

01:02:35.751 --> 01:02:36.285
LOAN.

01:02:36.352 --> 01:02:37.353
VERSUS SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:38.121
GONNA PAY OFF EVERY DAY I'VE

01:02:38.187 --> 01:02:39.622
YOUR CASH REGISTER.

01:02:39.689 --> 01:02:40.656
AND THIS IS THE DILEMMA THAT

01:02:40.723 --> 01:02:42.024
THEY ALL FACE HOW DO YOU CREATE

01:02:42.091 --> 01:02:43.526
THE APPLES TO APPLES WITH THESE

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:45.328
DIFFERENT PRODUCTS.

01:02:45.394 --> 01:02:46.262
AND THIS SHOWS YOU THAT YOU CAN

01:02:46.329 --> 01:02:47.964
HAVE DIFFERENT PRODUCTS.

01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:49.065
WITH DIFFERENT LOAN AMOUNTS IN

01:02:49.132 --> 01:02:50.633
DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS BUT THE ONE

01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:51.634
THING THAT YOU CAN COMPARE THE

01:02:51.701 --> 01:02:53.269
APPLES.

01:02:53.336 --> 01:02:54.904
TO IS THE ANNUALIZED COST OF

01:02:54.971 --> 01:02:56.739
CAPITAL IN BOTH BOTH CHARTS.

01:02:56.806 --> 01:02:58.307
THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO GET YOU

01:02:58.374 --> 01:03:00.042
AN APR AN ACC.

01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:00.943
THE GOING TO SHOW YOU THE A

01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:02.512
WHATEVER THE LAW REQUIRES WHAT

01:03:02.578 --> 01:03:03.446
THEY'RE GOING TO PROVIDE IN THIS

01:03:03.513 --> 01:03:05.314
IS A WAY FEET ACROSS COMPARISON

01:03:05.381 --> 01:03:07.049
SHOP THAT DOES EXIST TODAY

01:03:07.116 --> 01:03:07.350
[inaudible]

01:03:07.416 --> 01:03:10.319
OKAY [inaudible]

01:03:10.386 --> 01:03:11.954
SOME SORRY.

01:03:12.021 --> 01:03:12.855
SO I GET HOW YOU CAN COMPARE THE

01:03:12.922 --> 01:03:15.091
EAST.

01:03:15.158 --> 01:03:16.959
TALL IN I I APPLAUD WHAT YOU'RE

01:03:17.026 --> 01:03:17.560
TRYING TO DO I THINK THIS IS

01:03:17.627 --> 01:03:18.094
GOOD.

01:03:18.161 --> 01:03:20.329
MY CONCERN IS HOW DO YOU COMPARE

01:03:20.396 --> 01:03:22.298
THIS -- TO

01:03:22.365 --> 01:03:25.368
MY A BUSINESS CREDIT CARD OR

01:03:25.434 --> 01:03:26.502
SOMETHING IT'S GIVING ME JUST

01:03:26.569 --> 01:03:27.870
ANY PR.

01:03:27.937 --> 01:03:33.910
AT THE CAN.

01:03:33.976 --> 01:03:35.444
SMALL BUSINESSES USE

01:03:35.511 --> 01:03:35.745
[inaudible]

01:03:35.811 --> 01:03:38.114
CREDIT.

01:03:38.181 --> 01:03:40.016
VARIETY OF WAYS A MINUTE I GUESS

01:03:40.082 --> 01:03:41.117
YOU CAN SAY LOAN BUT I MEAN

01:03:41.184 --> 01:03:42.919
ESPECIALLY SMALL BUSINESSES.

01:03:42.985 --> 01:03:44.253
USE OF RIGHT I'M JUST WORRIED

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:46.856
ABOUT THAT LIKE ARE WE THIS

01:03:46.923 --> 01:03:49.325
MAKES VERY GOOD.

01:03:49.392 --> 01:03:50.860
FOR WHAT WERE WHAT YOU ARE

01:03:50.927 --> 01:03:52.795
TRYING TO DO BUT THAT'S NOT THE

01:03:52.862 --> 01:03:54.530
ONLY WAY PEOPLE AYE AYE BORROW

01:03:54.597 --> 01:03:55.898
MONEY TO WRITE AND THE

01:03:55.965 --> 01:03:57.733
CHALLENGES THAT THAT THE CREDIT

01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:00.369
CARD APR IT'S BASED ON HOW MUCH

01:04:00.436 --> 01:04:01.637
YOU PAY AND WHEN THAT WOULD

01:04:01.704 --> 01:04:02.972
THAT'S JUST AN ESTIMATE.

01:04:03.039 --> 01:04:04.473
BUT IT'S A CHANGING ESTIMATE

01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:06.075
EVERY MONTH IF YOU DECIDE TO

01:04:06.142 --> 01:04:08.911
ONLY PAY SO MUCH INTO PRINCIPLE.

01:04:08.978 --> 01:04:10.913
AT THAT'S GONNA CHANGE.

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:12.515
THAT NUMBER AND SO THAT'S THE

01:04:12.582 --> 01:04:14.784
DILEMMA OF EVEN LOOKING AT THAT

01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:16.052
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT OF COUPLE

01:04:16.118 --> 01:04:19.088
OF I PUT THIS ON MY CREDIT CARD.

01:04:19.155 --> 01:04:20.556
VERSES TAKE GOTTA A A A BUSINESS

01:04:20.623 --> 01:04:22.325
LOAN IT'S A VERY CHALLENGING

01:04:22.391 --> 01:04:23.526
THING FOR ANYONE TO TO

01:04:23.593 --> 01:04:25.695
UNDERSTAND BECAUSE A AND AND

01:04:25.761 --> 01:04:26.729
THAT'S WHY TO GO BACK TO THE

01:04:26.796 --> 01:04:29.165
SIMPLICITY IS THE ANNUAL COST.

01:04:29.232 --> 01:04:30.633
NOT AN AP ARE THAT THAT

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:32.335
FLUCTUATES AND OBVIOUSLY SOME IN

01:04:32.401 --> 01:04:33.769
THE INDUSTRY SAY WE LOVE ITAND

01:04:33.836 --> 01:04:35.504
SOME SAY THEY HATE IT.

01:04:35.571 --> 01:04:36.072
AND WANTED IT CHANGED IN THE

01:04:36.138 --> 01:04:37.773
BILL.

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:39.041
AND THAT WILL ALWAYS REMAIN THAT

01:04:39.108 --> 01:04:41.010
DILEMMA BUYER BEWARE WITH BUYER

01:04:41.077 --> 01:04:42.612
BEWARE LENDER BE WHERE.

01:04:42.678 --> 01:04:43.479

01:04:43.546 --> 01:04:45.014
SMALL BUSINESS OWNER ONE

01:04:45.081 --> 01:04:47.183
ADDITIONAL TOOL AND THAT'S NOT

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:48.251
HOW MUCH IS THE MONEY GOING TO

01:04:48.317 --> 01:04:49.385
COST ME OR HOW MUCH I PAY EVERY

01:04:49.452 --> 01:04:50.753

HOW DO WE PROVIDE AN APPROPRIATE

01:06:19.208 --> 01:06:20.343
LEVEL DISCLOSURE TO GET THAT

01:06:20.409 --> 01:06:21.210
SMALL BUSINESS PERSON A FIGHTING

01:06:21.277 --> 01:06:22.578
CHANCE?

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:24.313
IN THE LENDING MARKET I HADN'T

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:25.314
THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER A

01:06:25.381 --> 01:06:26.749
PROVIDING BOTH AND WHETHER THAT

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:27.950
WOULD BE HELPFUL ARE LESS

01:06:28.017 --> 01:06:29.585
HELPFUL I'M OPEN MINDED TO IT.

01:06:29.652 --> 01:06:31.153
IT WAS REALLY TRYING TO I'VE

01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:32.355
BEEN TRYING TO SIMPLIFY THIS

01:06:32.421 --> 01:06:33.389
BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

01:06:33.456 --> 01:06:34.990
EFFORTS TO COMPLICATED AND

01:06:35.057 --> 01:06:35.791
THAT'S WHY HADN'T GONE IN THAT

01:06:35.858 --> 01:06:37.226
DIRECTION BUT I'M STILL OPEN

01:06:37.293 --> 01:06:38.527
MINDED ABOUT WHETHER THAT WE

01:06:38.594 --> 01:06:39.428
HAVE MORE HELP FULLER LESS.

01:06:39.495 --> 01:06:40.563
WHY WOULD SAY FOR A LOT OF SMALL

01:06:40.629 --> 01:06:41.597
BUSINESSES AND I THINK ABOUT

01:06:41.664 --> 01:06:43.132
SMALL BUSINESSES MY COMMUNITY

01:06:43.199 --> 01:06:44.467
WHERE YOU HAVE A LOT OF NON

01:06:44.533 --> 01:06:45.901
ENGLISH SPEAKERS A LOT NOT

01:06:45.968 --> 01:06:47.136
NATIVE SPEAKERS?

01:06:47.203 --> 01:06:48.704
BEING ABLE TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT

01:06:48.771 --> 01:06:49.538
TWO DIFFERENT COMPLETELY

01:06:49.605 --> 01:06:50.973
DIFFERENT PRODUCTS ONE THAT'S

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:52.375
NOT MAYBE NOT SUPPOSE WE USE FOR

01:06:52.441 --> 01:06:53.509
SMALL BUSINESS LOANS BUT AS A

01:06:53.576 --> 01:06:54.877
CREDIT CARD VERSES THIS.

01:06:54.944 --> 01:06:56.379
THAT TO WIND UP THE LETTERS

01:06:56.445 --> 01:06:58.114
REGARDLESS OF HOW YOU GET TO

01:06:58.180 --> 01:06:59.315
THAT NUMBER WHAT IT MEANS THEN

01:06:59.382 --> 01:07:01.183
BUT WHY NOT THE LETTERS AND TRY

01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:02.318
TO GET TO SOME.

01:07:02.385 --> 01:07:05.521
COMPARISON WOULD BE HELPFUL

01:07:05.588 --> 01:07:07.056
ASSUMING THE LEVEL OF KNOWLEDGE

01:07:07.123 --> 01:07:07.723
I THINK THAT.

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:09.692
THAT EVEN IF IT WAS IN THERE --

01:07:09.759 --> 01:07:11.727
HOME LANGUAGE.

01:07:11.794 --> 01:07:12.328
PROBABLY I MEAN IT'S BEYOND ME

01:07:12.395 --> 01:07:16.999
AND SIR MYSELF SLIGHTLY EDUCATED

01:07:17.066 --> 01:07:19.135
BUT I DEFINITELY WITH FOLKS WHO

01:07:19.201 --> 01:07:21.137
WHO ARE NEW TO THIS COUNTRY AND

01:07:21.203 --> 01:07:22.371
WHO ARE TRYING TO FIGURE THIS

01:07:22.438 --> 01:07:24.073
ALL OUT A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT

01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:24.373
[inaudible]

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:26.175
THINK.

01:07:26.242 --> 01:07:28.677
THINK YOU AS A MEMBER STEINORTH --

01:07:28.744 --> 01:07:29.812
FIRST I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY I

01:07:29.879 --> 01:07:31.046
THINK THIS IS VERY CLEVER --

01:07:31.113 --> 01:07:32.314
I'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS FOR OVER

01:07:32.381 --> 01:07:33.482
TWENTY YEARS AND MY BUSINESS IS

01:07:33.549 --> 01:07:34.750
HELPING LOCAL AND SMALL

01:07:34.817 --> 01:07:36.452
BUSINESSES GROW AND I'VE BEEN

01:07:36.519 --> 01:07:37.653
DOING THAT SUCCESSFULLY I'VE

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:39.221

THOUSAND BUSINESSES BE

01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:40.723
SUCCESSFUL.

01:07:40.790 --> 01:07:41.991
AND TO THE SINGLE GREATEST

01:07:42.057 --> 01:07:43.859
REASON FOR THEIR FAILURE IS

01:07:43.926 --> 01:07:45.194
UNDER CAPITALIZATION.

01:07:45.261 --> 01:07:47.730
PERIOD THAT'S IT AND SO SHORT

01:07:47.797 --> 01:07:49.331
TERM VERSUS LONGER TERM --

01:07:49.398 --> 01:07:51.400
ACCESS TO CAPITAL I BELIEVE THAT

01:07:51.467 --> 01:07:52.835
YOUR WAY OF I'M REALLY TRYING TO

01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:54.403
ADD TO TRANSPARENCY TO THE SHORT

01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:55.838
TERM ACCESS TO CAPITAL SO PEOPLE

01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:56.972
HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF

01:07:57.039 --> 01:07:57.907
WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST A

01:07:57.973 --> 01:07:58.307
BUSINESS.

01:07:58.374 --> 01:07:59.775

01:08:05.381 --> 01:08:06.649
A SENATOR YOU KNOW I'VE HAD

MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

01:08:08.918 --> 01:08:10.686
THIS AYE ANYTHING AND THE

01:08:10.753 --> 01:08:12.388
ANALYSIS DOES EXPRESS SOME

01:08:12.455 --> 01:08:13.989
CONCERN --

01:08:14.056 --> 01:08:15.891
WITH THE ABILITY --

01:08:15.958 --> 01:08:17.893
TO IN FORCE PARTICULARLY BECAUSE

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:20.863
ENFORCEMENT IS ALSO A WAY.

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:22.164
TO ENSURE THAT YOUR OBJECTIVE IS

01:08:22.231 --> 01:08:24.867
MET.

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:25.367
BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE

01:08:25.434 --> 01:08:26.335
OBJECTIVE [inaudible]

01:08:26.402 --> 01:08:29.071
AND BUT WE'VE ALSO HAD

01:08:29.138 --> 01:08:29.872

THE BEST DECISIONS.

01:08:44.119 --> 01:08:46.088
WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT AT THIS

01:08:46.155 --> 01:08:48.290

A STANDARDIZATION AND SO AS I

01:08:55.564 --> 01:08:56.966
LISTEN TO COLLEAGUES BRING ON

01:08:57.032 --> 01:08:58.968
THE CONCERNS FORWARD ABOUT HOW

01:08:59.034 --> 01:09:00.436

THAT THIS IS THAT AT LEAST FOR

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:25.995
THE MOMENT A TEMPORARY SOLUTION

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:29.365
WE CAN UNDERSTAND.

01:09:29.431 --> 01:09:31.734
I AM I STILL CONTINUE TO HAVE

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:33.736

01:20:51.479 --> 01:20:54.416
APPROACH TO REQUIRE MORE WOMEN

PUBLICLY HELD CORPORATIONS IN

01:20:57.786 --> 01:21:01.723
CALIFORNIA THIS IS S. B. A

01:21:27.782 --> 01:21:30.118
SO MORE THAN 80% OF THE STATE'S

01:21:30.185 --> 01:21:32.053
CORPORATIONS ARE OPERATING

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:33.288
WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF THE

01:21:33.355 --> 01:21:35.890

01:21:43.365 --> 01:21:45.467
THE RESULTS OF CORPORATIONS

01:21:45.533 --> 01:21:47.469
BECAUSE RESEARCH CLEARLY SHOWS

01:21:47.535 --> 01:21:48.970
THAT BOARDS WITH WOMEN MEMBERS

01:21:49.037 --> 01:21:49.671
PERFORM BETTER IN THE

01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:51.706
MARKETPLACE.

01:21:51.773 --> 01:21:53.808
BY HAVING SUCH LOW PARTICIPATION

01:21:53.875 --> 01:21:55.677
RATES FOR WOMEN IN ARE KEPT OUR

01:21:55.744 --> 01:21:57.145
CORPORATE LEADERSHIP RANKS HERE

01:21:59.214 --> 01:22:00.982
INHIBIT OUR OWN ECONOMIC

01:22:01.049 --> 01:22:02.884

01:22:02.951 --> 01:22:04.653
OTHER NATIONS HAVE PREVIOUSLY

01:22:04.719 --> 01:22:05.487
ACKNOWLEDGED THE FINANCIAL

01:22:05.553 --> 01:22:07.989

01:22:08.056 --> 01:22:09.291
PERCENTAGE OF BOARD MEMBERS TO

BE FEMALE THAT'S REPRESENTING

01:22:11.593 --> 01:22:13.395
THE EXPERIENCE EXPERTISE AND

01:22:13.461 --> 01:22:15.664
WISDOM OF HALF THE POPULATION.

01:22:15.730 --> 01:22:17.399
WHICH ALSO REPRESENTS 70% OF ALL

01:22:17.465 --> 01:22:19.634
THE CONSUMERS.

01:22:19.701 --> 01:22:21.369
THIS MEASURE TAKES A BIG STEP

01:22:21.436 --> 01:22:23.605
TOWARD CLOSING THIS GENDER GAP.

01:22:23.672 --> 01:22:25.607
IT INCREASES GENDER DIVERSITY ON

01:22:25.674 --> 01:22:27.742
CORPORATE BOARDS BY REQUIRING

01:22:27.809 --> 01:22:29.477

THERE ARE SIX OR MORE DIRECTORS.

01:22:49.264 --> 01:22:51.132
AND AS I MENTIONED THE RESEARCH

01:22:51.199 --> 01:22:52.200
ON THIS IS CLEAR.

01:22:52.267 --> 01:22:53.001
THOSE ARE TWENTY SIXTEEN

TOP MANAGEMENT LEVELS.

01:23:07.282 --> 01:23:08.550
ARE ALSO BUSINESSES THAT

01:23:08.616 --> 01:23:10.218
PERFORMED THE BEST.

01:23:10.285 --> 01:23:12.954

WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK?

01:23:20.762 --> 01:23:22.364
SO -- THIS A

01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:24.199
STUDY ALSO FOUND THAT IN

01:23:24.265 --> 01:23:25.567
COMPANIES WHERE THERE WERE THREE

01:23:25.633 --> 01:23:27.202
OR MORE WOMEN CREATING SORT OF

01:23:27.268 --> 01:23:28.670
THAT CRITICAL MASS THAT WE TALK

SCORED HIGHER ON AVERAGE ON THE

01:23:36.344 --> 01:23:38.480
ORGANIZATION PERFORMANCE PROFILE.

01:23:38.546 --> 01:23:40.148
THAN COMPANIES WITH NO WOMEN ON

01:23:40.215 --> 01:23:42.283
BOARDS OR IN THE EXECUTIVE RANKS

01:23:47.789 --> 01:23:49.758
SO I AUTHORED A RESOLUTION ON

01:23:49.824 --> 01:23:53.027
THIS IN TWENTY THIRTEEN SCR A

01:23:53.094 --> 01:23:54.763

AS A RESULT OF THAT.

01:24:16.785 --> 01:24:18.686
AND CALIFORNIA WAS THE FIRST

01:24:18.753 --> 01:24:20.288
STATE IN THE UNITED STATES TO

ADOPT THIS TYPE OF RESOLUTION

01:24:21.823 --> 01:24:23.958
WHICH WAS AGAIN OVERWHELMINGLY

01:24:24.025 --> 01:24:24.659
SUPPORTED.

FOUR YEARS AND OF HANDLED MANY

01:26:41.863 --> 01:26:43.531
BOARD SEARCHES AND TO EXPLAIN

01:26:43.598 --> 01:26:46.034
WHY THERE ARE NOT MORE WOMEN ON

01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:48.369
BOARD CURRENTLY WHY DOESN'T THIS

01:26:48.436 --> 01:26:49.737
JUST HAPPEN ORGANICALLY.

01:26:49.804 --> 01:26:52.540
AND IT'S BECAUSE OVER THE YEARS

01:26:52.607 --> 01:26:55.209
OF MEN UNDERSTANDABLY SO --

01:26:55.276 --> 01:26:58.179
OVER THE YEARS DECADES OF

01:26:58.246 --> 01:26:59.547
COMPANIES OF OUR CEOS HAVE

01:26:59.614 --> 01:27:02.750
WANTED OTHER CEOS TO BE ON THEIR

01:27:02.817 --> 01:27:04.052
ADVISORY BOARDS ON THEIR BOARDS

01:27:04.118 --> 01:27:05.286
OF DIRECTORS TO ADVISE THEM HOW

01:27:05.353 --> 01:27:06.988
TO BE A CEO AND THAT'S WHAT THE

01:27:07.055 --> 01:27:08.256
BOARD DOES.

01:27:08.323 --> 01:27:10.158
IS TO HIRE AND FIRE THE C. E. O.

01:27:10.224 --> 01:27:11.526
ADVISE THE STRATEGY OF THE

01:27:11.593 --> 01:27:14.529
COMPANY AND TO GUIDE THE

01:27:14.596 --> 01:27:17.966
COMPENSATION OF THE CEO AND THE

01:27:18.032 --> 01:27:19.267
SENIOR MANAGEMENT.

01:27:19.334 --> 01:27:24.606
SO TRADITIONALLY OF THEY'VE ALL.

01:27:24.672 --> 01:27:25.773
MEMBERS AND THAT PRIMARILY IS

01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:27.575
ANGLO MEANT.

01:27:27.642 --> 01:27:29.877
AND WITH THAT O. WHEN THE IT HAS

01:27:29.944 --> 01:27:31.112
EVOLVED THAT --

01:27:31.179 --> 01:27:33.815
MORE SHAREHOLDERS ARE INSISTING

01:27:33.881 --> 01:27:36.017
THAT OTHER TALENTS BE BROUGHT ON

01:27:36.084 --> 01:27:38.152
OTHER EXPERIENCE AT A IN NOW ON

01:27:38.219 --> 01:27:39.587
BOARD ROOMS BECAUSE OF SO MANY

01:27:39.654 --> 01:27:40.788
OTHER --

01:27:40.855 --> 01:27:43.157
IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT COMPANIES

01:27:43.224 --> 01:27:44.826
HAVE TO FACE ON BEHALF OF THE

01:27:44.892 --> 01:27:46.594
SHAREHOLDERS LIKE A

01:27:46.661 --> 01:27:48.563
CYBERSECURITY AND HUMAN

01:27:48.630 --> 01:27:51.733
RESOURCES AND THE OTHER ASPECTS

01:27:51.799 --> 01:27:53.601
OF THE TECHNOLOGY IT'S SET FOR

01:27:53.668 --> 01:27:55.470
OF THAT WOMEN CAN BRING TO THE

01:27:55.536 --> 01:27:55.703
BOARD.

01:27:55.770 --> 01:27:57.839
NOW THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT

01:27:57.905 --> 01:28:00.008
THEY WOULD CONSIDER WOMEN

01:28:00.074 --> 01:28:01.809
HOWEVER WHEN BOARD MEMBERS THAT

01:28:01.876 --> 01:28:03.344
WHEN THE BOARD HIRE US TO DO A

01:28:03.411 --> 01:28:04.912
SEARCH THEY SAY BETSY BRING US A

01:28:04.979 --> 01:28:05.680
WOMAN.

01:28:05.747 --> 01:28:06.848
WITH A REALLY ONE A WOMAN BUT

01:28:06.914 --> 01:28:08.549
WILL GOTTA HAVE ONE BECAUSE THE

01:28:08.616 --> 01:28:09.417
SHAREHOLDERS WHAT WHAT AND I

01:28:09.484 --> 01:28:10.918
I'VE HEARD THIS.

01:28:10.985 --> 01:28:12.787
AND WE JUST LAUGHED AT THAT A

01:28:12.854 --> 01:28:14.288
LITTLE BIT AND THEN CONTINUE ON

01:28:14.355 --> 01:28:16.557
BUT SEARCH BUT THEY SAY OF BRING

01:28:16.624 --> 01:28:19.160
US ONE WHO DOESN'T TALK TOO MUCH

01:28:19.227 --> 01:28:20.161
AND DOESN'T DISRUPT TOO MUCH.

01:28:20.228 --> 01:28:22.697
SO THERE'S AN AUTOMATIC FEELING

01:28:22.764 --> 01:28:24.432
THAT WOMEN ARE A BRING --

01:28:24.499 --> 01:28:27.235
THE IT'S IT'S AND IT'S NOT MEANT

01:28:27.301 --> 01:28:29.971
TO BE A EVIDENT BIAS BUT IT'S A

01:28:30.038 --> 01:28:32.373
INHERENT BIAS THAT WOMEN CHANGES

01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:33.908
THE DYNAMIC OF THE BOARD.

01:28:33.975 --> 01:28:36.678
SO IT'S CHALLENGING TO AT LEAST

01:28:36.744 --> 01:28:38.312
TO HAVE WOMEN WHO.

01:28:38.379 --> 01:28:40.782
A CAN BE BOARD MEMBERS FROM THE

01:28:40.848 --> 01:28:41.315
BOARD MEMBERS WILL ACCEPT

01:28:41.382 --> 01:28:41.616
[inaudible]

01:28:41.683 --> 01:28:43.084
SO.

01:28:43.151 --> 01:28:44.786
BUT WITH MUCH MORE EFFORT TO GET

01:28:44.852 --> 01:28:46.821
THAT DONE WE CAN MAKE A HUGE

01:28:46.888 --> 01:28:48.222
DIFFERENCE IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF

01:28:48.289 --> 01:28:49.924
TIME BY REQUIRING.

01:28:49.991 --> 01:28:52.527
THAT EACH PUBLIC COMPANY BOARD

01:28:52.593 --> 01:28:55.129
PUT ON AT LEAST ONE WOMAN IN THE

01:28:55.196 --> 01:28:55.897
NEXT YEAR.

01:28:55.963 --> 01:28:58.132
AND THEY'RE ONE FOURTH OF ALL

01:28:58.199 --> 01:28:59.467
PUBLIC COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA

01:28:59.534 --> 01:29:01.335
HAVE NO WOMEN ON THEIR BOARDS

01:29:01.402 --> 01:29:03.104
ONE FOURTH WHICH IS SIGNIFICANT

01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:05.907
NUMBER AND BEEN FAR OUT WEIGH US

01:29:05.973 --> 01:29:07.275
IN TERMS OF NUMBERS.

01:29:07.341 --> 01:29:10.344
THAT THEY'RE THREE THREE

01:29:10.411 --> 01:29:10.945
THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED MEN ON

01:29:11.012 --> 01:29:12.747
CORPORATE BOARDS IN CALIFORNIA

01:29:12.814 --> 01:29:16.350
PUBLIC COMPANIES COMPARED TO

01:29:16.417 --> 01:29:17.218
FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE WOMEN.

01:29:17.285 --> 01:29:19.153
SO THERE'S A HUGE DISPARITY AND

01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:20.555
WHEN THOSE MEN ARE ASKED WHAT

01:29:20.621 --> 01:29:22.356
WOMEN YOU KNOW OUR WAY TO GET

01:29:22.423 --> 01:29:23.624
WHAT WOMEN YOU KNOW WHO COULD

01:29:23.691 --> 01:29:25.226
COME ONTO OUR BOARD.

01:29:25.293 --> 01:29:26.961
OF THEY DON'T KNOW THAT THAT

01:29:27.028 --> 01:29:30.498
WOULD CAN ASSURE YOU THERE ARE

01:29:30.565 --> 01:29:31.699
FIFTY EIGHT STORIES OF WOMEN IN

01:29:31.766 --> 01:29:34.869
THIS BOOK OF MY BOOK YOU DON'T

01:29:34.936 --> 01:29:35.803
HAVE TO BUY IT HOWEVER.

01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:38.473
HER HIT BUT IT TALKS ABOUT HOW

01:29:38.539 --> 01:29:39.674
THE WOMEN ONLY GOT ON TO

01:29:39.741 --> 01:29:41.109
CORPORATE BOARDS BECAUSE THEY

01:29:41.175 --> 01:29:42.844
KNEW SOMEONE ON THAT BOARD AND

01:29:42.910 --> 01:29:44.912
WERE ENDORSED FOR MEMBERSHIP ON

01:29:44.979 --> 01:29:46.948
THAT BOARD AND THAT'S IMPORTANT

01:29:47.014 --> 01:29:48.349
FOR US TO GET WOMEN KNOWN.

01:29:48.416 --> 01:29:49.817
SO WITH THAT I'LL TURN OVER THE

01:29:49.884 --> 01:29:51.786
MICROPHONE TO AND LISA BARRETT

01:29:51.853 --> 01:29:53.187
TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT BRIEFLY

01:29:53.254 --> 01:29:56.524
ABOUT OUR OUR RESEARCH.

01:29:56.591 --> 01:29:57.825
THANK YOU SO MUCH AT THE END

01:29:57.892 --> 01:29:59.160
THANK YOU SENATOR.

01:29:59.227 --> 01:30:01.596
AND MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF

01:30:01.662 --> 01:30:02.964
THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR

01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:04.499
HAVING US TODAY.

01:30:04.565 --> 01:30:06.667
MY NAME DALY SAID THERE IT AND

01:30:06.734 --> 01:30:08.002
AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED I'M A

01:30:08.069 --> 01:30:09.303
CLINICAL PROFESSOR AT THE

01:30:09.370 --> 01:30:10.838
UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO.

01:30:10.905 --> 01:30:13.074
HOUSE SO CONDUCT RESEARCH ON

01:30:13.141 --> 01:30:14.075
BOARD OF DIRECT WORDS OF

01:30:14.142 --> 01:30:15.676
DIRECTORS AND I'VE BEEN WORKING

01:30:15.743 --> 01:30:17.578
IN THIS FIELD ADVISING BOARDS

01:30:17.645 --> 01:30:20.081
AND INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS.

01:30:20.148 --> 01:30:21.516
ONBOARD EFFECTIVENESS AND BOARD

01:30:21.582 --> 01:30:24.318
COMPOSITION FOR TWENTY YEARS.

01:30:24.385 --> 01:30:25.887
AND I DID A STUDY LOOKING OUT

01:30:25.953 --> 01:30:28.723
THE CALIFORNIA BOARD MEMBERS THE

01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:31.225
CALIFORNIA BOARDS TO IDENTIFY

01:30:31.292 --> 01:30:33.027
EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING

01:30:33.094 --> 01:30:35.429
ABOUT THE PREVALENCE OF WOMEN IN

01:30:35.496 --> 01:30:36.531
COMPANIES HEADQUARTERED HERE IN

01:30:36.597 --> 01:30:37.999
CALIFORNIA.

01:30:38.065 --> 01:30:39.834
AND HAS BEEN NOTED THAT I'M

01:30:39.901 --> 01:30:42.003
UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA --

01:30:42.069 --> 01:30:43.604
IS ACTUALLY EVEN BEHIND THE

01:30:43.671 --> 01:30:45.106
NATIONAL PERCENTAGES WHEN IT

01:30:45.173 --> 01:30:47.241
COMES TO PREVALENCE OF WOMEN

01:30:47.308 --> 01:30:48.676
DIRECTORS AMONG.

01:30:48.743 --> 01:30:51.112
AND THE PEOPLE SERVING ON

01:30:51.179 --> 01:30:52.380
CORPORATE BOARDS OF COMPANIES

01:30:52.446 --> 01:30:53.915
HEADQUARTERED HERE IN CALIFORNIA

01:30:53.981 --> 01:30:56.250
WHERE A LITTLE OVER 15%.

01:30:56.317 --> 01:30:58.519
WHEREAS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL AT

01:30:58.586 --> 01:31:01.289
16% ON AND AS WAS MENTIONED A

01:31:01.355 --> 01:31:02.723
QUARTER OF THE COMPANIES

01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:05.927
HEADQUARTERED HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:31:05.993 --> 01:31:07.695
HAD NO WOMEN ON THEIR BOARDS AND

01:31:07.762 --> 01:31:09.363
IN FACT WHEN LOOKING AT THAT BY

01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:11.265
REGION WE SEE UNFORTUNATELY THAT

01:31:11.332 --> 01:31:13.601
MY HOMETOWN OF SAN DIEGO.

01:31:13.668 --> 01:31:15.903
IS AND IS THE WORST TO HIT WHEN

01:31:15.970 --> 01:31:18.172
IT COMES TO AND THE PREVALENCE

01:31:18.239 --> 01:31:20.107
OF COMPANIES WITH NO FEMALE

01:31:20.174 --> 01:31:22.210
DIRECTORS 40% OF THE COMPANIES

01:31:22.276 --> 01:31:23.010
HEADQUARTERED IN.

01:31:23.077 --> 01:31:24.312
SAN DIEGO HAD NO WOMEN ON THE

01:31:24.378 --> 01:31:26.647
BOARDS.

01:31:26.714 --> 01:31:28.816
SO -- I JUST

01:31:28.883 --> 01:31:30.351
WANTED TO YOU KNOW TWO THINGS

01:31:30.418 --> 01:31:33.521
BRIEFLY PLEASE AND ONE IS AT THE

01:31:33.588 --> 01:31:35.256
ISSUES REGARDING THAT THE

01:31:35.323 --> 01:31:36.824
AVAILABILITY OF QUALIFIED

01:31:36.891 --> 01:31:39.694
CANDIDATES FOR BOARD SERVICE.

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:40.995
THERE ARE --

01:31:41.062 --> 01:31:41.629
THERE MAY BE CONCERNS THAT THERE

01:31:41.696 --> 01:31:44.065
ARE.

01:31:44.131 --> 01:31:45.867
SERVE ON CORPORATE BOARDS AND IN

01:31:45.933 --> 01:31:47.735
FACT THIS IS NOT THE CASE.

01:31:47.802 --> 01:31:50.004
AND BETSY IS THE CEO OF

01:31:50.071 --> 01:31:51.939
ORGANIZATION AND THERE ARE MANY

01:31:52.006 --> 01:31:53.741
OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE

01:31:53.808 --> 01:31:54.642
COUNTRY THEN FACT AROUND THE

01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:55.276
WORLD.

01:31:55.343 --> 01:31:57.678
THAT AND HAVE MEMBERS WHO ARE

01:31:57.745 --> 01:32:00.047
AND SEEKING CORPORATE BOARDS

01:32:00.114 --> 01:32:03.017
SERVICE AND WOMEN DIRECTORS I AM.

01:32:03.084 --> 01:32:04.218
CURRENTLY SITTING ON CORPORATE

01:32:04.285 --> 01:32:05.853
BOARDS AND THOSE WHO ARE LOOKING

01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:06.954
TO SERVE ON CORPORATE BOARDS WHO

01:32:07.021 --> 01:32:09.357
ARE EMINENTLY QUALIFIED TO DO SO.

01:32:09.423 --> 01:32:12.393
AND THERE ARE CONCERNS ALSO

01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:14.295
ABOUT AND INDIVIDUAL WOMEN

01:32:14.362 --> 01:32:16.597
SERVING ON TOO MANY BOARDS AND

01:32:16.664 --> 01:32:18.399
IF THIS LAW WERE TO BE PASSED IN

01:32:18.466 --> 01:32:20.201
FACT I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT.

01:32:20.268 --> 01:32:21.235
THE FACT THAT THERE IS A

01:32:21.302 --> 01:32:22.870
MECHANISM TO ADDRESS THIS

01:32:22.937 --> 01:32:25.539
CONCERN THAT IS IN PLACE ALREADY.

01:32:25.606 --> 01:32:27.241
AND THERE MAY BE CONCERNED ABOUT

01:32:27.308 --> 01:32:28.843
INDIVIDUAL SERVING ON TOO MANY

01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:31.212
BOARDS HOWEVER THE INSTITUTIONAL

01:32:31.279 --> 01:32:33.347
SHAREHOLDERS VOTE AGAINST

01:32:33.414 --> 01:32:35.483
DIRECTORS WHO ARE SERVING ON TOO

01:32:35.549 --> 01:32:36.450
MANY BOARDS.

01:32:36.517 --> 01:32:38.619
SO BOARDS WOULD NOT ALLOW THEIR

01:32:38.686 --> 01:32:41.989
MEMBERS TO SERVE ON MORE THAN

01:32:42.056 --> 01:32:43.324
THREE OR FOUR CORPORATE BOARD SO

01:32:43.391 --> 01:32:45.326
THIS WOULD NOT BE AN ISSUE FOR

01:32:45.393 --> 01:32:46.794
THE WOMEN WHO ARE BROUGHT IN TO

01:32:46.861 --> 01:32:47.995
SERVE ON BOARDS HEARING

01:32:48.062 --> 01:32:49.630
CALIFORNIA.

01:32:49.697 --> 01:32:51.966
AND WHEN THE FLY IT LIES PUT

01:32:52.033 --> 01:32:54.001
INTO PLACE AND ANOTHER ISSUES

01:32:54.068 --> 01:32:56.103

OVER MAN ON THE BOARD IS A FALSE --

01:42:09.590 --> 01:42:10.958
ANALOGY BECAUSE WHAT THE BILL

01:42:11.024 --> 01:42:12.092

01:42:26.907 --> 01:42:29.276

BEEN THIS SORT OF BLANKET

01:43:16.023 --> 01:43:17.824
DISCRIMINATION SO RATHER THAN

01:43:39.479 --> 01:43:39.713
REGISTRIES.

01:43:39.780 --> 01:43:41.315
THESE PEOPLE WILL CERTAINLY

01:43:41.381 --> 01:43:42.449
QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT THE

01:43:49.823 --> 01:43:52.426
POINT IS THE POINT IS THAT THESE

CHANCE AND IN GREAT MEASURE

01:43:57.130 --> 01:43:58.799
BECAUSE AS WAS POINTED OUT THIS

01:43:58.865 --> 01:44:00.300
HAS BEEN SORT OF A WHITE MAN'S

01:44:00.367 --> 01:44:01.969
BASTION FOR YEARS.

01:44:02.035 --> 01:44:04.671

DOORS WE WILL FIND THAT NOT ONLY

01:44:18.051 --> 01:44:19.953

WOMEN OF COLOR AND WE WILL HAVE

01:44:21.154 --> 01:44:23.323
PEOPLE OF COLOR BECAUSE WE WILL

01:44:23.390 --> 01:44:24.191
HAVE.

01:44:24.257 --> 01:44:26.493
A AB BASICALLY TAKEN THE

01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:27.828
CHALLENGE OF FINDING THE BEST

01:44:27.894 --> 01:44:28.996
QUALIFIED PEOPLE FOR THESE

01:44:29.062 --> 01:44:31.064
POSITIONS IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR

01:44:31.131 --> 01:44:32.432
GENDER IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR

01:44:32.499 --> 01:44:34.768
SEXUAL ORIENTATION PERSPECTIVE

01:44:34.835 --> 01:44:36.570
OR OF THEIR OF REYES SORT.

01:44:36.637 --> 01:44:38.605
I MEAN THAT WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS

01:44:38.672 --> 01:44:40.874
WE HAVE HAD A GLASS CEILING AND

01:44:40.941 --> 01:44:42.409
A CEILING THAT HAS BEEN.

01:44:42.476 --> 01:44:44.511
A TO A PLACE WITH THAT THE

01:44:44.578 --> 01:44:46.413
THERE'S NO DOOR EXCEPT FOR WHITE
