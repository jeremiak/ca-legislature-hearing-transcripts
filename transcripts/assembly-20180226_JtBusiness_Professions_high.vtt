PROFESSIONAL MYSELF I KNOW HOW

VACANCIES WHICH I ACTUALLY I

00:15:49.081 --> 00:15:50.849 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
DON'T FIND ACCEPTABLE.

00:15:50.916 --> 00:15:52.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU KNOW THAT'S BEEN A REQUEST

00:15:53.052 --> 00:15:54.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

I'M GOING NOW.

00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:05.731 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE HAVE REVISED THE ENTIRE SEA

00:16:15.741 --> 00:16:16.575 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
BOARD IS ALLOWED.

00:16:16.642 --> 00:16:18.277 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IT REQUIRES LICENSEES TO KEEP

00:16:18.344 --> 00:16:19.611 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THEIR CERTIFICATES FOR FOUR

00:16:19.678 --> 00:16:21.146 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YEARS WERE ABLE TO GO BACK THAT

00:16:21.213 --> 00:16:22.514 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FAR IN THE AUDITING PROCESS AND

00:16:22.581 --> 00:16:23.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE'RE ABLE TO RESUME FROM WHERE

00:16:23.682 --> 00:16:25.517 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE LEFT OFF. YOUR RESUMING RIGHT

00:16:25.584 --> 00:16:27.753 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
NOW CORRECT. OKAY.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE OTHER ISSUE ALSO IN TERMS

00:16:29.855 --> 00:16:32.691 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OF CONTINUING EDUCATION. AS I

00:16:32.758 --> 00:16:33.459 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
UNDERSTAND IS THAT THE BOARD

00:16:33.525 --> 00:16:36.295 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ALSO APPROVES THE CD PROVIDERS

00:16:36.362 --> 00:16:37.896 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OF COURSE IS CORRECT THAT IS

00:16:37.963 --> 00:16:38.464 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
CORRECT.

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:40.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
SO WHEN THE THINGS THAT.

00:16:40.799 --> 00:16:42.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
YOU MENTIONED IS IS THAT.

00:16:42.801 --> 00:16:44.336 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
YOU KNOW THERE'S I GUESS

00:16:44.403 --> 00:16:45.371 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THERE'S A FLAT FEE OF A HUNDRED

00:16:45.437 --> 00:16:47.473 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FIFTY DOLLARS PER PROVIDER BUT

00:16:47.539 --> 00:16:48.207 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
YOU HAVE SOME PROVIDERS

00:16:48.273 --> 00:16:50.008 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PROVIDING. LOTS OF COURSES AND

00:16:50.075 --> 00:16:51.510 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
SOME PROVIDING A FEW.

00:16:51.577 --> 00:16:54.880 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND I PRESUME. I MEAN AND THEN

00:16:54.947 --> 00:16:56.382 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE OTHER PART IS COMMENTED ON

00:16:56.448 --> 00:16:57.950 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WAS IS THAT WHILE THERE ARE

00:16:58.016 --> 00:17:00.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LEGAL STANDARDS. REGARDS TO.

00:17:01.019 --> 00:17:02.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:17:02.187 --> 00:17:03.856 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YOU KNOW CONFLICT OF INTEREST

00:17:03.922 --> 00:17:04.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
AND.

00:17:04.323 --> 00:17:06.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHICH IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

00:17:06.725 --> 00:17:07.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BECAUSE I THINK I COULD YOU

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:09.628 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EDUCATION SHOULD NOT BE A SALES

00:17:09.695 --> 00:17:11.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
JOB. UNFORTUNATELY. YOU KNOW

00:17:11.997 --> 00:17:13.265 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I'VE SEEN THAT HAPPEN WHERE

00:17:13.332 --> 00:17:14.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SOMEONE THEY CALL IT CONTINUING

00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:16.502 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EDUCATION IT'S SELLING A PRODUCT

00:17:16.568 --> 00:17:17.936 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT THEY'RE PROFITING FROM.

00:17:18.003 --> 00:17:19.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO WE NEED TO BE VERY ON TOP OF

00:17:20.038 --> 00:17:20.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT.

00:17:20.873 --> 00:17:22.508 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT BASICALLY IT'S A COMPLAINT

00:17:22.574 --> 00:17:24.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BASED SYSTEM AND WE'RE NOT

00:17:24.209 --> 00:17:26.078 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ACTIVELY PURSUING AND LIKE

00:17:26.145 --> 00:17:27.546 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
REQUIRING PEOPLE TO SUBMIT

00:17:27.613 --> 00:17:30.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHAT'S THE COURSE CONTENT IS.

00:17:30.349 --> 00:17:31.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WHAT THEIR DECLARATIONS FOR

00:17:31.183 --> 00:17:32.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CONFLICT ARE ADVERTISEMENTS

00:17:32.985 --> 00:17:34.420 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
RELATE TO THOSE COURSES?

00:17:34.486 --> 00:17:35.921 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO BEING MUCH MORE PRO ACTIVE

00:17:35.988 --> 00:17:37.489 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ABOUT IT INSTEAD OF PASSIVE

00:17:37.556 --> 00:17:39.691 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BECAUSE YOU KNOW FRANKLY MOST

00:17:39.758 --> 00:17:41.026 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
THE PEOPLE WHO GO.

00:17:41.093 --> 00:17:42.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THEY SEE SOMETHING. THAT THEY

00:17:42.928 --> 00:17:45.464 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
THINK MAYBE SHADY DELL EITHER
GO.

00:17:45.531 --> 00:17:46.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THERE MAY BE SOME INCENTIVES TO

00:17:46.632 --> 00:17:48.300 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GO EVEN OF PRIDE YOU FREE DINNER

00:17:48.367 --> 00:17:50.068 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OR WILL PAY YOU KNOW YOU GET

00:17:50.135 --> 00:17:51.403 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THERE SOMETHING I MEAN THOSE ARE

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:52.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
TYPES OF THINGS. THAT THAT.

00:17:53.005 --> 00:17:55.507 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEY'LL BE VERY CONCERNING AND

00:17:55.574 --> 00:17:56.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT'S YOU AND EXPECTS ME TO

00:17:56.775 --> 00:17:57.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
COMPLAIN ABOUT THAT.

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:01.914 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO WHAT IS BEING DONE TO TRY TO

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.349 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO BE MUCH MORE PROACTIVE ANSWER

00:18:04.416 --> 00:18:06.151 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SIMPLY WAITING FOR COMPLAINTS

00:18:06.218 --> 00:18:08.053 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

AGAIN.

00:18:08.454 --> 00:18:11.490 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NOW IF YOU ARE AUDITING AND FOR

00:18:11.557 --> 00:18:11.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%

YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF STAFF

00:18:13.792 --> 00:18:15.327 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ONLY TO DO IT AND THEN THE OTHER

00:18:15.394 --> 00:18:16.261 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THINGS ARE YOU CONSIDERING

00:18:16.328 --> 00:18:18.230 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PERHAPS A PER COURSE FEE AND AS

00:18:18.297 --> 00:18:20.132 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WELL AS A PROVIDER FEE TO ENSURE

00:18:20.199 --> 00:18:21.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%

RUNNING AT THAT DEFICIT EVEN

00:18:25.404 --> 00:18:26.538 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THOUGH YOU DO HAVE A FAIRLY

00:18:26.605 --> 00:18:28.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

PATIENTS IN CALIFORNIA.

00:18:36.815 --> 00:18:38.050 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'LL START AT THE FIRST QUESTION

00:18:38.116 --> 00:18:39.852 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OF THE BOARD'S REGULATIONS DO

00:18:39.918 --> 00:18:41.620 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

ADVERTISEMENTS AND WE DO REVIEW

00:18:47.759 --> 00:18:49.595 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

SO THERE.

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:00.906 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEY'RE MADE TO DECLARE IF THAT

00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:02.407 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IS THE CASE IN THE APPLICATION.

ISSUES THAT. INCREASES THE TIME

00:27:42.961 --> 00:27:44.529 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FRAME IS THAT THEY'RE VERY

00:27:44.596 --> 00:27:46.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
COMPLEX.

BE VERY CLEAR. OVER THREE YEARS

00:31:16.641 --> 00:31:18.509 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DID SO WERE WE DOING TO SHRINK

00:31:18.576 --> 00:31:20.278 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT I MEAN IS ACCEPTABLE TO BE

00:31:20.345 --> 00:31:21.679 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
THREE YEARS.

00:31:21.746 --> 00:31:23.214 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE FROM A

00:31:23.281 --> 00:31:24.449 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
PUBLIC PERSON TRACTION

00:31:24.515 --> 00:31:25.183 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
STANDPOINT.

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:27.218 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND THAT THE AVERAGE THAT IS

00:31:27.285 --> 00:31:28.052 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE OTHER HALF OF THEM ARE

00:31:28.119 --> 00:31:30.188 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
LONGER EXACTLY RIGHT AND A

00:31:30.255 --> 00:31:31.089 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
NUMBER OF OUR SMALLER AGAIN

00:31:31.155 --> 00:31:32.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THESE ARE LOWER NUMBER OF CASES

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:35.093 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ARE AVERAGE DOES GET AFFECTED BY

00:31:35.159 --> 00:31:36.361 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT BUT IT IS OUR AVERAGE.

00:31:36.427 --> 00:31:39.197 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO IMPROVE

00:31:39.264 --> 00:31:40.265 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THOSE TIME AS WE HAVE BEEN

00:31:40.331 --> 00:31:41.199 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT

00:31:41.266 --> 00:31:42.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
JUSTICE AND WITH A DIVISION OF

00:31:42.333 --> 00:31:43.401 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
INVESTIGATION.

00:31:43.468 --> 00:31:45.536 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO

00:31:45.603 --> 00:31:48.273 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REDUCE THAT TIME WHAT'S WHAT'S

00:31:48.339 --> 00:31:50.041 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE GOAL HOW LONG SHOULD BE.

00:31:50.108 --> 00:31:51.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AS LOW AS POSSIBLE I BELIEVE OUR

00:31:51.976 --> 00:31:53.111 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TARGETS MODERN FORTY DAYS.

00:31:53.177 --> 00:31:55.079 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BUT SAID I BELIEVE THE TARGET

00:31:55.146 --> 00:31:56.147 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DATE IS FIVE IRON FORTY DAYS

00:31:56.214 --> 00:31:58.549 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FROM START RECEIVING COMPLAINTS

00:31:58.616 --> 00:31:59.350 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
TO.

00:31:59.417 --> 00:32:01.185 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
YEARS IS THAT THAT WOULD BE

00:32:01.252 --> 00:32:03.855 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
JUST OVER. ONE AND A HALF YES

00:32:03.921 --> 00:32:05.456 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OKAY SO DOES THAT STILL A YEAR

00:32:05.523 --> 00:32:06.891 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND A HALF AND IT'S OBVIOUSLY

00:32:06.958 --> 00:32:07.525 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
MUCH BUT ME MUCH GREATER

00:32:07.592 --> 00:32:09.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IMPROVEMENT AND THE NUMBERS WE

00:32:09.661 --> 00:32:11.763 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HAVE HERE CERTAINLY AND. IF I

00:32:11.829 --> 00:32:12.997 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MAY BRING ATTENTION THE FACT

00:32:13.064 --> 00:32:13.965 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT IT HAS TO GO THROUGH THIS

00:32:14.032 --> 00:32:15.199 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OCCASION THAT HAS TO GO TO THE

00:32:15.266 --> 00:32:17.335 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DEPARTMENT JUSTICE AND HEARINGS.

00:32:17.402 --> 00:32:18.903 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AS WELL SO THAT DOES TACK ON

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:21.039 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MORE TIME BUT IT IS A COMPLETE

00:32:21.105 --> 00:32:23.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND OPEN PROCESS IS THERE A WAY

00:32:23.374 --> 00:32:25.276 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO GET A. BREAK DOWN TO REALIZE

00:32:25.343 --> 00:32:26.844 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THERE'S A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT

00:32:26.911 --> 00:32:27.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SO SOMEONE TAKE LONGER AND

00:32:27.945 --> 00:32:29.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OTHERS AS A WAY TO DO MORE OF A

00:32:29.914 --> 00:32:31.549 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BREAK DOWN LIKE HOW MANY PEOPLE

EDITION OF THE CALIFORNIA NCC

01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:01.029 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHAM A FACT SHEET WHICH UP THERE

01:20:01.096 --> 01:20:02.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IS A LINK TO IN THAT SO I WON'T

01:20:06.134 --> 01:20:06.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
LIMITED.

.

01:20:08.103 --> 01:20:09.671 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I DID WANT TO SAY THAT THE NCC

01:20:09.738 --> 01:20:13.208 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WEB OF COURSE STRONGLY SUPPORTS

01:20:13.275 --> 01:20:14.743 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
UNIFICATION OF THIS PROFESSION

01:20:14.809 --> 01:20:16.611 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WITHIN CALIFORNIA AND WITHIN THE

01:20:16.678 --> 01:20:17.646 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
UNITED STATES.

01:20:17.712 --> 01:20:19.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:20:19.681 --> 01:20:21.550 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE LACK OF UNITY IS HURTING OUR

01:20:21.616 --> 01:20:24.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
PROFESSION VERY BADLY.

01:20:24.753 --> 01:20:26.021 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE ACUPUNCTURE PROFESSION THE

01:20:26.087 --> 01:20:28.056 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CALIFORNIA IS FALLING BEHIND THE

01:20:28.123 --> 01:20:29.758 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PROFESSION IN OTHER STATES.

01:20:29.824 --> 01:20:31.026 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AND OUR PROFESSION FACES

01:20:31.092 --> 01:20:32.294 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
NUMEROUS MAJOR THREATS

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:33.929 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.

01:20:33.995 --> 01:20:35.664 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE ARE AT RISK OF LOSING BUT ALL

01:20:35.730 --> 01:20:37.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OF US WHO WORK SO HARD AND SO

01:20:37.632 --> 01:20:39.434 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
LONG TO GAME.

01:20:39.501 --> 01:20:41.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ONE OF THE MAJOR OBSTACLES TO

01:20:41.303 --> 01:20:42.904 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
UNIFIED NATIONAL ACUPUNCTURE

01:20:42.971 --> 01:20:45.340 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PROFESSION. HAS BEEN THE LACK OF

01:20:45.407 --> 01:20:46.875 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
A SINGLE NATIONAL ENTRY LEVEL

01:20:46.942 --> 01:20:49.511 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EXAMINATION. IN ALIGNMENT WITH

01:20:49.578 --> 01:20:50.579 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
EVERY OTHER HEALTH CARE

01:20:50.645 --> 01:20:53.982 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PROFESSION IN THE UNITED STATES.

01:20:54.049 --> 01:20:55.717 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THIS IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT

01:20:55.784 --> 01:20:57.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO A NATIONAL STANDARD UNIFIED

01:20:57.752 --> 01:21:00.789 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PROFESSION AND A STRONG VOICE.

01:21:00.855 --> 01:21:02.057 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE OTHER THING I WANT TO POINT

01:21:02.123 --> 01:21:04.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OUT IS THAT I LEARNED THIS

01:21:04.192 --> 01:21:05.627 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
MORNING SOMEONE ALREADY

01:21:05.694 --> 01:21:07.829 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

01:21:09.631 --> 01:21:10.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

01:21:10.632 --> 01:21:13.301 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THIS.

01:21:13.368 --> 01:21:14.903 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I THINK I HAVE THE SHEET THAT

01:21:14.970 --> 01:21:16.605 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
WAS HANDED TO ME HERE.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND I THINK

01:21:58.246 --> 01:22:00.215 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

THIS IS A PENALTY THAT WE

REPRESENTATIVE FROM OUR

01:50:07.467 --> 01:50:09.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COMMITTEE. WE ACTUALLY FEEL THAT

01:50:09.903 --> 01:50:11.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE ARE GETTING REALLY GOOD INPUT

01:50:11.271 --> 01:50:13.073 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT LET ME ASK LET ME DEFER TO

01:50:13.139 --> 01:50:14.140 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
ME MICHELLE BEING IN THE

01:50:14.207 --> 01:50:16.343 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INDUSTRY. I'M I I DO THINK THAT

01:50:16.409 --> 01:50:17.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
WE HAVE A GOOD WORKING

01:50:17.077 --> 01:50:18.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
RELATIONSHIP WITH IN IN

01:50:18.945 --> 01:50:19.946 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
PARTICULAR WITH THE DENTAL
BOARD.

01:50:20.013 --> 01:50:23.216 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT IN PRACTICE AT THE DENTIST

01:50:23.283 --> 01:50:26.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EMPLOYERS STILL SUPERVISES. THE

01:50:26.152 --> 01:50:28.321 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DENTAL HYGIENISTS ON WITH REGARD

01:50:28.388 --> 01:50:30.056 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
TO SCOPE WE DO HAVE. IN OUR

01:50:30.123 --> 01:50:32.258 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
STATUTES THAT IF WE WANTED IF

01:50:32.325 --> 01:50:33.893 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE COMMITTEE WANTED THE AGENCY

01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:35.929 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WANTED TO CHANGE. ANYTHING WITH

01:50:35.996 --> 01:50:37.564 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REGARD TO SCOPE OF PRACTICE AT

01:50:37.630 --> 01:50:38.598 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT RECOMMENDATION WOULD GO

01:50:38.665 --> 01:50:41.101 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BEFORE THE DENTAL BOARD AND.

01:50:41.167 --> 01:50:43.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WE AMENDED THE STATUTE TO

01:50:44.004 --> 01:50:45.138 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
REQUIRE THE DENTAL BOARD TO

01:50:45.205 --> 01:50:46.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RESPOND WITHIN A CERTAIN PERIOD

01:50:46.639 --> 01:50:48.241 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF TIME THAT WE WE CAN GET THE

01:50:48.308 --> 01:50:51.811 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INFORMATION BACK TO THE DH CC.

01:50:51.878 --> 01:50:54.748 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO I I I DON'T DISSIPATE THAT

01:50:54.814 --> 01:50:56.049 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
CHANGING IF IN FACT WE ARE

01:50:56.116 --> 01:50:57.384 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
LABELED AS A DENTAL HYGIENE

01:50:57.450 --> 01:50:59.919 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BOARD. I DON'T SEE THAT CHANGING

01:50:59.986 --> 01:51:02.022 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AT ALL BREAK AND THEN TO THAT TO

01:51:02.088 --> 01:51:03.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT COME THEY JUST MADE THE

01:51:03.223 --> 01:51:04.891 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DISTINCTION BETWEEN THAT OF

01:51:04.958 --> 01:51:06.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COMEDIAN BORDERS ARE FUNCTIONAL

01:51:06.493 --> 01:51:09.562 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DIFFERENCES DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN

01:51:09.629 --> 01:51:10.230 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
THAT OF OF THE NAME.

01:51:10.296 --> 01:51:10.830 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WE CURRENTLY PERFORM ALL

01:51:10.897 --> 01:51:12.232 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
FUNCTIONS OF A BOARD.

01:51:12.298 --> 01:51:13.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
IT'S JUST THAT WHEN THE

01:51:13.867 --> 01:51:15.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LEGISLATION CAME INTO PLAY BACK

01:51:15.802 --> 01:51:16.936 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. THERE

01:51:17.003 --> 01:51:20.206 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
WAS.

01:51:20.273 --> 01:51:22.642 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
CONCERNED.

01:51:22.709 --> 01:51:24.611 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE POWERS TO BE ONE AND THE

01:51:24.677 --> 01:51:26.946 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NAME COMMITTEE VERSUS BOARD. ON

01:51:27.013 --> 01:51:28.248 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE JUST WAS A CONCERN ABOUT

01:51:28.314 --> 01:51:29.516 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INCREASING THE NUMBER OF BOARDS

01:51:29.582 --> 01:51:32.252 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AT THE TIME IN CALIFORNIA AND SO

01:51:32.318 --> 01:51:34.421 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THAT THE. COMMITTEE'S NAME

01:51:34.487 --> 01:51:35.789 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
BECAME COMMITTEE.

01:51:35.855 --> 01:51:37.323 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
SO FOR ME THERE IS NO

01:51:37.390 --> 01:51:38.992 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE THE THE

01:51:39.059 --> 01:51:40.160 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IT'S JUST A NAME CHANGE THERE'S

01:51:40.226 --> 01:51:41.494 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NO LATE AT THE NAME CHANGE AND.

01:51:41.561 --> 01:51:43.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THERE'S SOME JURISDICTION

01:51:43.530 --> 01:51:45.131 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LANGUAGE OUT IN THE BEGINNING OF

01:51:45.198 --> 01:51:46.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
THE OF OUR.

01:51:46.933 --> 01:51:50.070 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EVER CODE. THAT SAYS WERE UNDER

01:51:50.136 --> 01:51:51.671 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE DENTAL BOARD WHICH WE.

01:51:51.738 --> 01:51:53.073 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REALLY AREN'T BECAUSE WE ARE AN

01:51:53.139 --> 01:51:54.507 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
INDEPENDENT BOARD.

01:51:54.574 --> 01:51:56.276 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND I HAVE HEARD TOO THAT WHEN

01:51:56.342 --> 01:51:57.444 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHEN WE'RE LABELED A COMMITTEE

01:51:57.510 --> 01:51:59.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
IT IT'S IT'S.

01:51:59.179 --> 01:52:00.146 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IT'S KIND OF A TRANSPARENCY

01:52:00.213 --> 01:52:01.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
THANK WHERE.

01:52:02.048 --> 01:52:03.483 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OUR STAKE HOLDERS HAVE SAID WHEN

01:52:03.550 --> 01:52:04.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE'RE TITLED THE COMMITTEE IT

01:52:04.818 --> 01:52:06.119 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SEEMS LIKE WE'RE A SUBDIVISION

01:52:06.186 --> 01:52:08.354 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF SOMETHING ELSE. AND SO THAT'S

01:52:08.421 --> 01:52:09.422 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WHY WE'VE BEEN PUTTING THIS

01:52:09.489 --> 01:52:11.224 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
REQUEST AND SO THAT WAY SINCE

01:52:11.291 --> 01:52:11.791 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE'VE BEEN FUNCTIONING AS AN

01:52:11.858 --> 01:52:14.394 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AUTONOMOUS GOVERNMENTAL BODY.

01:52:14.461 --> 01:52:17.163 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
THAT WE SHOULD BE TITLED AS
SUCH.

01:52:17.230 --> 01:52:18.465 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
IN OUR IN THE LAW THAT.

01:52:18.531 --> 01:52:19.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IN THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS

01:52:19.732 --> 01:52:21.835 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
CODE THAT GIVES THE THE

01:52:21.901 --> 01:52:24.404 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DEFINITION OF A BOARD IT'S HIS

01:52:24.471 --> 01:52:26.506 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BOARD BEER OR COMMISSION BUT

01:52:26.573 --> 01:52:28.374 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THERE'S NO MENTION OF COMMITTEE.

01:52:28.441 --> 01:52:29.476 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
SO THAT'S JUST THE THE

01:52:29.542 --> 01:52:30.810 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
MISUNDERSTANDING THAT'S OUT

01:52:30.877 --> 01:52:32.278 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THERE IS THAT IF YOUR COMMITTEE

01:52:32.345 --> 01:52:33.680 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
YOU SEEM TO BE A SUBSET OF

01:52:33.746 --> 01:52:35.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SOMETHING ELSE I WOULD LIKE TO

01:52:35.081 --> 01:52:37.450 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ADD ALSO THAT BEFORE THE DENTAL

01:52:37.517 --> 01:52:38.351 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
HYGIENE COMMITTEE WITH THE

01:52:38.418 --> 01:52:39.619 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
COMMITTEE WAS. WHAT'S THIS

01:52:39.686 --> 01:52:41.754 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
INDEPENDENT BODY. WE FUNCTION

01:52:41.821 --> 01:52:43.356 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DENTAL HYGIENE FUNCTION UNDER

01:52:43.423 --> 01:52:44.624 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THE COMMITTEE ON DENTAL

01:52:44.691 --> 01:52:45.992 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
