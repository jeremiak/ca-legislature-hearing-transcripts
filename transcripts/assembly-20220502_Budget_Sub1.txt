GUYS PREPARED BEEN PREPARING TO IMPLEMENT A NEW PORTFOLIO PROGRAMS UNDER THE HIP HOP FUNDING AND STATUTES. THERE WERE NUMBERS STAKEHOLDER PROPOSALS AND IDEAS TO SUPPORT PIPELINE CAREER PATHWAY ACTIVITIES SO WE WANTED TO DEVELOP A SUITE OF PROGRAMS THAT IS THOUGHTFUL. WELL INTEGRATED AND SUPPORTS THE INTENT OF THE STATUTE AND THE GROUNDWORK LAID OUT IN THE CALIFORNIA FUTURE HEALTH WORKFORCE COMMISSION REPORT. WE ARE PLANNING TO RELEASE OUR NEW APPLICATION BY MID JUNE AT LATEST. THIS PROGRAM WILL CREATE A FUNDING OPPORTUNITY FOR PIPELINE IN CAREER PATHWAY PROGRAMS SUPPORTING A BROAD SPECTRUM OF CAREERS IN PRIMARY CARE. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND ALLIED HEALTH FOR EXAMPLE. THIS RELEASE IS THE BEGINNING OF OUR WORK AND WE HOPE TO CONTINUE GROWING AND EXPANDING OUR SUITE OF PROGRAMS OVER TIME.

WE HAVE ALSO EXECUTED THE GRANT AGREEMENT WITH THE MANAGING AGENCY THE FOUNDATION FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES FOR THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL SCHOLARS PROGRAM. ANOTHER PIPELINE IN CAREER PATHWAY PROGRAM. AND THAT PROGRAM IS UNDERWAY. NEXT I WANTED TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS pREGARDING- SONG BROWN. IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY SEVENTEEN H. GUY RECEIVED A SIGNIFICANT AUGMENTATION IN FUNDING FOR THE SONG BROWN PROGRAM ON THE ANNUAL BUDGET WENT FROM SIX POINT SIX MILLION ARE COMING FROM THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND DATA AND PLANNING FUND TO AN ONGOING THIRTY THREE MILLION APPROPRIATED FROM THE GENERAL FUND. WITH THIS NEW FUNDING WE WERE ABLE TO START TRACKING OUR PROGRESS TO DEMONSTRATE THE IMPACT OF THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING. SO WE WANTED TO REPORT TODAY THAT SENSE TWENTY SEVENTEEN. THE SONG BROWN PRIMARY CARE RESIDENCY PROGRAM. FUNDING HAS SUPPORTED THE LAUNCHING OF TWENTY FIVE NEW PROGRAMS THAT RECEIVED ACCREDITATION. THE EXPANSION OF TWENTY ONE EXISTING PROGRAMS. AND ALTOGETHER ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THREE ADDITIONAL PRIMARY CARE RESIDENCY SLOTS. OVERALL DURING THIS TIME DURING THE NUMBER OF SLOTS IN CALIFORNIA GREW BY THREE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT SLOTS THE SONG BROWN SUPPORTED TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THREE OF THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT IN SOCKS.

APPROXIMATELY 25% OF SONG BROWN SUPPORTED RESIDENTS ARE BLACK OR HISPANIC COMPARED 211% OF THE PRIME OVERALL PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN WORKFORCE. IN TERMS OF HOW IT CARE WILL INCREASE OUR ACCOUNTABILITY. H. CAR CURRENTLY HAS A SERIES OF GUIDELINES THAT ENSURE PROPER USE OF GRANTS AND PROGRAMS APPLY THEY CERTIFY THAT THE INFORMATION THEY ARE PRIDING PROVIDING IS TRUE AND ACCURATE. FOR A SPECIFIC LANGUAGE IN THE GUIDANCE IN GRANT AGREEMENTS THAT PROHIBIT THE PLANTING. OF EXISTING STATE OR LOCAL FUNDS. AND THE GRANT AGREEMENT REQUIRES THE GRANT KEY TO KEEP CLEAR RECORDS FOR AT LEAST THREE YEARS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE USE OF THEIR FUNDS. BEFORE WE BEGIN ANY APPLICATION CYCLE WE PROVIDED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WEBINAR TO ANY POTENTIAL APPLICANTS. AND WE ALWAYS REINFORCE THE REQUIREMENTS ABOUT THE USE OF THESE GRANT FUNDS. AND WHEN PROGRAMS INVOICE US FOR PAYMENT THEY CERTIFY THAT THE FUNDING WENT TO THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF THE RESIDENTS THAT. WE ARE SUPPORTING TO THIS PROGRAM. H. PRESS CAREFULLY CRAFTED OUR APPLICATION GRANT AGREEMENT PROCESSES TO FULFILL THE GOALS OF THE SONG BROWN AS DESCRIBED AUDITING THIS PROGRAM WOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL STAFFING AND RESOURCES. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWERING QUESTIONS THANK YOU. WITH THAT I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DÍAS FOR ANY MEMBERS QUESTIONS C. NON I WILL KEEP IT HERE AT THE CHAIR ALL START WITH EACH COPPER HIP-HOP OR- HOWEVER YOU WOULD. LIKE IT TO BE AS AN ACRONYM I'M QUITE- ENCOURAGED TO HEAR THAT BY MID JUNE THERE WILL BE APPLICATIONS OUT AT THE LATEST. I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS FOR IMPLEMENTATION DOES THAT MEAN BY THIS FALL THAT SOME OF THESE PATHWAYS WILL BE UP AND RUNNING. AND THEN IF I CAN YOU DIDN'T IDENTIFY ANY SPECIFIC SCHOOLS BUT HAVE WE DONE OUTREACH TOWARDS. EITHER THE UC BOARD OF REGENTS OR THE CSU BOARD OF TRUSTEES TO DO A BROAD PRESENTATION TO THOSE- ORGANIZATIONS WOULD LOVE AN UPDATE ON. I'M SO- WE HAVE NOT DONE THE OUTRAGE BUT I THINK THAT'S A GREAT IDEA AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE STARTING TO DO IS I'M DO MORE OUTREACH AND WEBINARS TO ANNOUNCE OUR PROGRAMS AND SO WE WOULD CERTAINLY- BE I'M VERY HAPPY TO DO THAT I'M SO WHAT WE DO WANT TO DO IS WITH THEIR PROGRAM RELEASE IN JUNE THAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO AWARD APPLICANTS HERE IN EARLY SUMMER- AND THEN WE WOULD HOPE THAT SHORTLY THEREAFTER THEY WOULD BEGIN THEIR- THEIR PROGRAMS. I'M GONNA TRANSITION TO THE SONG BROWN- IT WAS VERY ENCOURAGING TO HEAR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE NEW PROGRAMS AND- AND EXPANSION OF TWENTY ONE. PROGRAMS BUT IT DIDN'T SOUND AS IF WE HAD- BEEN ABLE TO- VERIFY. WHETHER THE INFORMATION WHICH HAS BEEN SUBMITTED BY THE- INSTITUTIONS- HAVE NOT SUPPLANTED FUNDING AND SO. I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND- OTHER THAN AN AUDIT HOW HOW COULD WE ENSURE THAT THESE PUBLIC RESOURCES WERE NOT USED TO SUPPLANT CURRENT FUNDING FOR GMB SLOTS. SO OTHER THAN AN AUDIT WE ARE CONTINUING TO DO- WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING AND THAT IS THAT A PROGRAM CERTIFIES AND WHEN WE PAY THEM THEY CERTIFY THAT THOSE FUNDING WERE USED TO SUPPORT THE RESIDENTS. I'M WE HEARD EARLIER THAT THERE ARE THIRTY TWO POSITIONS WHICH ARE BEING TRANSFERRED FROM TEMPORARY TO PERMANENT POSITIONS. AND YET WE ALSO HEARD FROM YOU THAT YOU WOULD NEED FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO EVALUATE AND- LOOK AT THE- PROGRAM ITSELF TO ENSURE THAT IT'S- MEETING ITS DESIRED GOALS INSTATED- OUTCOMES THAT THAT I'D LIKE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE WE HAVE THAT LEVEL OF CLARITY WITH THESE EXPANSION PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY. AND SO IF THAT REQUIRES- THE FUNDING IF THAT IS NOT ABLE TO BE ABSORBED WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT STAFFING RESOURCES I WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION SO THAT WE THEN CAN DETERMINE WHETHER WE NEED TO ADD RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAM WILL BE EXPANDING PROGRAM- SLOT SAYS- IT WAS DESIGNED TO ONE SO I WOULD LOVE APPROPRIATE FOLLOW UP- ONE. THAT'S AVAILABLE. GREAT THANK YOU WITH THAT WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ISSUE THREE WHICH IS ON THE OFFICE OF HEALTHCARE AFFORDABILITY BCP WE WILL HAVE ONE PRESENTER ON THIS PANEL WHICH IS DIRECTOR ELIZABETH LANDSBERG OF H. KILEY- DIRECTOR LANDSBERG CAN YOU PLEASE BEGIN. OF COURSE GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ELIZABETH PLANS FOR THE DIRECTOR WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE ACCESS INFORMATION. THE OFFICE OF% HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY- POLICY WAS PROPOSED IN TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND WAS PRESENTED TO THIS COMMITTEE BACK IN FEBRUARY. SINCE THAT TIME THE ADMINISTRATION HAS COORDINATED CLOSELY WITH THE LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE STAFF AND TOGETHER ENGAGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS ISSUE. A LOT OF THE TOPICS THAT WE HAVE BEEN- PURSUING IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS INCLUDE TREATMENT OF MEDICAL COSTS IN CALCULATING THE TOTAL COST OF CARE. WHICH PHYSICIAN ORGANIZATIONS WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE COST TARGETS. THE BOARD STRUCTURE INCLUDING CONFLICT RIGHT INTEREST STANDARD AND ANTI TRUST CONCERNS. THE DATES FOR SETTING THE COST TARGETS COORDINATION BETWEEN STATE AGENCIES FOR EXAMPLE ON QUALITY IN EQUITY STANDARDS AND THE ENFORCEMENT APPROACH INCLUDING THE SIZE OF PENALTIES AS WELL AS SEVERAL TECHNICAL ISSUES WHICH COME UP IN IN A BILL- WITH THIS BLANKS AND COMPLEXITY. WE HAVE SUBMITTED A REVISED BCP FOR SPRING FINANCED LETTER CONSIDERATION HERE THE REVISED BUDGET PROPOSAL REQUEST INCLUDES A TOTAL OF A HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO PHYSICIANS WE WOULD RAMP UP THE FIRST YEAR WE WOULD START WITH FIFTY EIGHT POSITIONS AND BY YOUR THREE WE WOULD BE FULLY STAFFED UP AT A HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO POSITIONS. TO IMPLEMENT THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY. THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES ONE TIME FUNDING OF THIRTY MILLION INCLUDED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. WHICH SUPPORTS FIRST YEAR COSTS AND A PORTION OF SECOND YEAR COSTS AS WELL AS ONGOING GENERAL FUND SUPPORT. AND THE ONGOING ANNUAL COST FOR THE PROGRAM WOULD BE A THIRTY ONE MILLION. FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND. THE RESOURCES NEEDED FOR THE OFFICE HAVE BEEN MODIFIED SLIGHTLY AS WE CONTINUED AS WE'VE MADE SOME CHANGES IN THE TRAILER PARK TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND CONTINUE TO CONSIDER THE OFFICES SUCCESS SO I'LL JUST GIVE A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE VCP STAFFING CHANGES. WE DID OUT OF PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT SEXUAL TO THE OFFICE WHICH WILL BE CRITICAL TO COORDINATING POLICY PLANNING AND STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT ACROSS ALL ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM. THE OFFICE WILL REQUIRE COMPLEX POLICY AND STAKEHOLDER ACTIVITIES SPANNING MANY DIFFERENT SECTORS HEALTHCARE ENTITIES AND POLICY AREAS. THE DECISION OF THE SECTION CREATES A DEDICATED ORGANIZATIONAL UNIT TO PROVIDE THESE FUNCTIONS WITH THE NEEDED CAPACITY. WE WILL HAVE AN OUR REGION EDUCATION TEAM TO FORGE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE HEALTHCARE ENTITIES SUBJECT TO THE COST TARGETS TO MAKE SURE WE'RE EDUCATING AND INFORMING AND WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE HEALTHCARE ENTITIES. ABOUT INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO REDUCE COSTS WHILE MAINTAINING QUALITY EQUITY WORKFORCE IN PRIMARY CARE AND VESTMENT. WHAT WE WILL ALSO HAVE A PLANNING AND GOVERNANCE TEAM TO COORDINATE PROGRAM PROGRAM POLICIES ACROSS ALL ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM INCLUDING LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS. THE TEAM ALSO STAFF AND SUPPORT AN INDEPENDENT BOARD INCLUDING PREPARING MATERIALS- AND HELPING ME MEMBERS ADMINISTRATIVE NEEDS SO THE ATTENTION OF THE SECTION RECOGNIZES THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE FUNCTIONS AND THE SIGNIFICANT WORKLOAD- OF STAFFING IN INDEPENDENT VERSUS AN ADVISORY BOARD. WE'VE ALSO CREATED A WORKFORCE IN PRIMARY CARE UNIT WHICH WILL BE CENTRAL TO MONITORING AND PROMOTING HEALTH CARE WORK FOR STABILITY AND MEASURING- AND PROMOTING SYSTEM WIDE INVESTMENT IN PRIMARY CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. WE ALSO HAVE CREATED AN ACQUISITION THE MANAGEMENT UNIT GIVEN THE PROGRAM SIZE AND COMPLEXITY WE REASSESS THE ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT NEEDED- AND ADDED THE ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE AND I. T. SUPPORT THAT WILL BE NEEDED. SO THOSE ARE THAT THE BASIC CHANGES- FROM LAST YEAR'S BCP THIS YEAR'S AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE MEMBERS MAY HAVE. THANK YOU I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DÍAS FOR ANY MEMBERS QUESTIONS. I'M. WITH THAT WE WILL MOVE ON TO PANEL FOR WHICH WILL PRESENT ON THE REDUCING THE COST OF INSULIN B. C. P. WE WILL HAVE TO PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL INCLUDING FOR SCHALKE GHANI ASSISTANT SECRETARY AT THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. AND LUKE CUSTOMER- SENIOR FISCAL AND POLICY ANALYST WITH THE L. A. L. LET'S BEGIN WITH DISTANCE SECRETARY BEGUN. GOOD AFTERNOON CHERUBS LED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OF PEOPLE GETTING INTO THE SPECIFICS OF THE APRIL ONE PROPOSAL I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT SENATE BILL EIGHT TO ENACTED IN SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. WHICH CODIFIED THE CALLER X. PROGRAM. CARRACKS CALLS FOR STATEWIDE GENERIC MANUFACTURING OF ESSENTIAL MEDICINES AND HIGHLY CONCENTRATED. LOW POLITICIAN DRUG MARKETS. SB EIGHT FIVE TWO SPECIFICALLY REQUIRES CAL HHS TO ENTER INTO PARTNERSHIPS. WITH GENERIC DRUG MANUFACTURING ON BEHALF OF THE STATE. ONE REQUIREMENT UNDER THE BELT IS NOT PARTNERSHIPS. BURKE GENERIC MANUFACTURING INCLUDE THE PRODUCTION ABOUT LEASE ONE FORM OF INSULIN PROVIDED THAT A POSSIBLE PATHWAY FOR MANUFACTURING A MORE AFFORDABLE FOR RESIDENTS ON EXCESS. HOUSE WIDELY DOCUMENTED THE INSULIN MARKET HAS LONG APPEARED A MODEST. THE MARKET FAILURES THAT PLAGUE THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. WHICHEVER IS ALTERED IN KEEPING AND SELLING PRICES HIGHER. CALIFORNIA AND IT'S RESIDENTS ARE DIRECTLY HARMED BY THESE COMPLEX MARKET FAILURES. KELLY UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED DIABETICS OFTENTIMES MUST PAY THE PRE REBATE LESS PRICE FOR THEIR INSULIN. MANY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS PER YEAR TO FOR THEIR LIFE SAVING MEDICINES MEDIC MEDICATIONS. BASED ON NATIONAL DATA AS MANY AS ONE AND FOR DIABETICS CANNOT AFFORD THEIR INSULIN AND DOES RATION OR OF CITIES TAKING INSULIN ALTOGETHER DID DURING THE STATE OF THE UNION. THE STATE IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO REMEDY THIS MARK MARKET FAILURE BY BRINGING MORE AFFORDABLE BIOSIMILAR INSULINS TO CALIFORNIA. THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO IMPLEMENT THE REQUIRED PARTNERSHIPS UNDER SB FIVE TWO BY INVESTING FIFTY MILLION INTO BIOSIMILAR INSULIN DEVELOPMENT WITH A CONTRACTOR. THE FIFTY MILLION WOULD BE PAID OUT ACCORDING TO A MILESTONE PAYMENT SCHEDULE. THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO INVEST AN ADDITIONAL FIFTY MILLION. TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CALIFORNIA BASED MANUFACTURING FACILITY. IN HIGH SKILL HIGH PAYING JOBS WITHIN THE STATE. THE FACILITY WOULD BE AT A JOINT AT A LOCATION JOINTLY DETERMINE BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE CONTRACTOR. CALLAGY JEFF WILL PARTNER WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. CODERS LEVERAGING ITS EXPERTISE AND BUSINESS INVESTMENT AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SERVICES. KELLY JUST WILL LEAN ON GO BUSINESS EXPERTISE TO MEDICATE RESCUE I'M PROPERLY DELIVER ON THE PROPOSED MANUFACTURING FACILITY. UNDER THIS PROPOSAL TALLERES WOULD IDENTIFY A PARTNER TO BRING. TO MARKET BOKKOS INTERCHANGEABLE BIOSIMILAR INSULINS WITH THE GOAL THAT CALIFORNIANS. WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO INSULIN CENTER FRACTION OF THE THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR PER VIAL LIST PRICES CURRENTLY CHARGED. INJECTING SUCH STEEP PRICE COMPETITION WOULD DISRUPT THE CURRENT MRKET AND EASE THE FINANCIAL BURDEN FOR MILLIONS OF DIABETICS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO IN ADDITION TO THAT THE CONSUMER SAVINGS ASSOCIATED WITH A LOW PRICED- CALAR EXPOSED TO MORE INSULIN THE STATE SIXTEEN THAT THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS AS PART OF A POTENTIAL PARTNERSHIP. THE FIRST WOULD BE PRIORITY ACCESS CALIFORNIANS WILL HAVE A PRIORITY SUPPLY. SO THAT THE STATE'S BALLING BOWLING NEEDS AREMET HOWEVER NO MILK MINIMUM VOLUME COMMAND THAT WOULD APPLY TO THE STATE. SECONDLY ARE WE THE STATE'S SIX- BRANDING OF THE CALORIFIC SINCE ONE PRODUCTS THIS MEANS THAT THE INSOLENCE WOULD BE SOLD. OUT WITHIN CALIFORNIA- WITH SOME TYPE OF WAY PLAYING- CALIFORNIA ELATED BRANDING. OUT IT COULD HAVE A LOCAL SUCH AS THE CALIFORNIA GOLDEN BEARS OR SOME TYPE OF VERBIAGE SUCH AS CALORIE ACCENTS. ONE BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS A HIGHLY UTILIZED. THIS TYPE OF LABEL WALKER BROWN TO. AMONG STAKE AND CROSS SUPPORTERS AND DEMONSTRATE THE STATE'S COMMITMENT. TO PROVIDING LOW COST PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. THIS THIRD WE THINK LOW LOW COST IMPLEMENTATION. DOCTORING IN WHICH THE STATE ITSELF WOULD HAVE TOTAL OWNERSHIP OF FACILITIES AND THE PRODUCTION PROCESS. ORDER SHIPS HERE CONTRACT MANUFACTURING ARE LIKELY THE LOWEST COST LOWEST REST AND MOST ASSERTIVELY FEASIBLE OPTION. FOR THE STATE TO BRING AFFORDABLE BIOSIMILAR INSULINS TO MARKET. THE CONTRACT MANUFACTURER WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PRODUCT ROLLOUT AND DISTRIBUTION SO THAT THE PRODUCTS ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIANS. FRIDAY OF RETAILERS PHARMACIES AND OTHER OUTLETS AS WELL AS MAIL ORDER PHARMACY. TO QUICKLY EVACUATE IN AGREEMENT WITH A CONTRACT MANUFACTURER. STATUTE STATUTORY CHANGES ARE ALSO PROPOSE THAT WOULD PROVIDE CONTRACT EXEMPTION AUTHORITY FOR H. KIND THE IMPLEMENTING DEPARTMENT FOR CALAR ACTS. THIS CONTRACT EXEMPTION WOULD ENABLE THE QUICKEST PATH FOR CONSUMERS ACCESS BIOSIMILAR INSULINS. IN THE FUTURE CALAR ACTS COULD ALSO ENTER INTO PARTNERSHIPS FOR OTHER DRUGS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING MARKET FAILURES BESIDES SENSE ONE. BY BRINGING A LOT OF CONSTANCE WANT TO MARKET REFLECTS THE PRIORITIES OF BOTH THE ADMINISTRATION. AND THE LEGISLATURE FOR LOWERING PRESCRIPTION DRUG OSTS. THIS MEANS SAVINGS TO THE UNINSURED UNDERINSURED AND THOSE WITH HIGH DEDUCTIBLE. ALL PLANS AS THESE CONSUMERS ARE EXPOSED TO HIGH WEST PRICES. AS WELL AS THE HEALTH PLANS WHO CAN OBTAIN A LOCAL LICENSE ONE THAN WHAT THEY CURRENTLY GET ENOUGH PRICES AFTER PHARMACY REBATES. THERE IS A HIGH POTENTIAL FOR ADDITIONAL SAVINGS TO THE BROADER MARKET. YEP OVERTIME THE BRANDED INSULIN MAKERS LOWER THEIR PRICES IN RESPONSE. ASIAN HELLO THERE WOULD BE INCREASE ADHERENCE TO INSULIN REGIMENS THEREBY IMPROVING THE HEALTH OUTCOMES OF DIED DIABETICS AND ELIMINATING ADVERSE EVENTS FROM RATIONING. SUCH AS DIABETES KETOACIDOSIS. ENCLOSING THE STATE BUDGET ACT MANUFACTURING AFFORDABLE AFFORDABLE INSULINS WILL PROVIDE RELIEF FOR MILLIONS OF DIABETICS AND ENERATE STATEWIDE. SYSTEM STATES GENERATE SYSTEM WIDE SAVINGS AND ADVANCE THE STATE'S ABILITY TO ADAPT TO ADDRESS THE DISPARITIES IN OUTCOMES EXPERIENCED BY THOSE WITH DIABETES. R. THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION BUT I'M HAPPY TO TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR THE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ON THE AGENDA. THANK YOU FIRST WE% WILL HEAR FROM THE L. L. THANK YOU LICORICE MORROW AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WE WANT TO FIRST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE PROPOSAL DEFINITELY HAS THE POTENTIAL IF IT IS SUCCESSFUL TO REDUCE THE COST OF INSULIN FOR CALIFORNIANS BOTH ITS RESIDENTS AND FOR THE STATE AS A- ENTITY- YES. THANK YOU. MAYBE MORE OF AN ALBUM. RICHARD THIS. YES NORTH. GOOD AFTERNOON THE CAGE MORROW WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'M SORRY FOR THE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES THERE- WANTED OF COURSE START OFF BY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE PROPOSAL IF IMPLEMENTED- SUCCESSFULLY COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COST CALIFORNIANS PAY FOR INSULIN- BOTH ON THE RESIDENTS AND ALSO AT THAT THE STATE AS AN ENTITY THAT BUYS INSULIN- HOWEVER THERE ARE NUMBER OF CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVED WITH THIS PROPOSAL- FIRST OF ALL THERE'S THE VIABILITY OF- WHETHER OR NOT. THAT PROPOSAL WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL IN BRINGING A PRODUCT TO MARKET WE NOTE THAT THIS PART OF HAS BECOME A LOT EASIER DUE TO CHANGES IN FEDERAL ELECTIONS HOWEVER AND ARE STILL ON A NUMBER OF REGULATORY AND OTHER IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES THAT WOULD BE INVOLVED IN BRINGING UP BIOSIMILAR AND INTERCHANGEABLE INSULIN PRODUCT TO MARKET MEANING THAT THE PRODUCT IS SIMILAR TO THE INSULIN THAT'S CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AND ALSO THAT A PHARMACY COULD SUBSTITUTE A BRAND NAME INSULIN WITH THE PRODUCT- AND NOTABLY IT WOULD LIKELY BE REQUIRED WORKING WITH A CONTRACTED BORROWED THAT DOESN'T HAVE. ONE THESE PRODUCTS ON THE MARKET CURRENTLY. SO IT'S ON HOW STATE INTO WOULD BE PROTECTED BOTH IN THE NEAR AND LONG TERM- THIS WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT AND WHAT THE MINISTRATIONS INDICATED THAT THE RELEASE OF THE FUNDING TO THE CONTRACTED PARTNER. WOULD BE TIED TO HITTING CERTAIN MILESTONES. DETAILS ON THESE MILESTONES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED AT THIS TIME. AND IN THE LONGER TERM WANT TO CONTRACT APARTMENT HAS RECEIVED THE FULL AMOUNT OF FUNDING IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT LEVEL DID WOULD REMAIN FOR THE STATE TO PROTECT ITS INTERESTS. IN ADDITION THE MINISTRATION HAS INTENDED THAT INTENDS TO KEEP. A RELATIONSHIP WITH A PARTNER BEYOND THE FUNDING PERIOD IN ORDER TO HELP MAINTAIN IN SHORT THE PRICES STAY LOW. HOWEVER THE STRUCTURE OF THIS RELATIONSHIP REMAINS UNCLEAR AND POTENTIALLY COULD CREATE ADDITIONAL LEGAL LIABILITIES FOR THE STATE. AND THEN FINALLY THERE WAS A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AND OVERSIGHT BUILT INTO THIS PROPOSAL- DEMONSTRATION HAS STATED THAT IT INTENDS TO WORK WITH A CONSULTANT TO MONITOR THE CONTRACTED PARTNERS- PROGRESS BUT THIS INFORMATION WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE SHARED. WITH THE OR BE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC OR THE LEGISLATURE. THIS LACK OF OVERSIGHT AND TRANSPARENCY IS FOR THE COMPOUNDED BY THE MINISTRATIONS REQUEST FOR AN EXEMPTION FROM THE STATE'S CONTRACTING ROLE THROUGH THE END OF TWENTY THIRTY TWO. AND ALL THE UNIQUE NATURE OF THIS CONTRACT COULD JUST FIND EXEMPTION FROM THE CONTRACTING RULES IT'S UNCLEAR WHY THIS EXEMPTION SHOULD EXTEND BEYOND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX WHICH IS WHEN THE FUNDING WINDOW EXPIRES. UNDER THE PROPOSAL. WE RECOMMEND THAT IF THE LEGISLATURE CHOOSES TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PROPOSAL. IT TAKES VARIOUS STEPS TO PROTECT THE STATE INTERESTS AND PROVIDE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. FIRST PRIOR TO THE STATE ENTER INTO THE CONTRACT RECOMMEND REQUIRING THAT THE MINISTRATION PROVIDE A PROGRAM OUT LUMINARY LIST OF MILESTONES THAT WOULD INCLUDE THE INCLUDING THE CONTRACT INCLUDING STEPS. LEADING UP TO- FDA APPROVAL. SECOND BECAUSE IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT PRIORITY- I'M SORRY WHAT PRICING WOULD BE- WE RECOMMEND APPLYING A PROVISION THE CONTRACTOR GRANT THE STATE THE RIGHT TO PURCHASE INSULIN AT COSTS AT LEAST UNTIL STATE SAVINGS EXCEED THE STATE INVESTMENT IN THE PARTNERSHIP. THIRTY WE RECOMMEND REQUIRED TO PROVISION THE CONTRACT THAT PROVIDES FOR PENALTIES IF THE CONTRACTOR PARTNER FAILS TO MEET THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT TO ENSURE THE STATE'S INTERESTS ARE PROTECTED. FOURTH WE RECOMMEND RECALL FOLLOWING THE- THE NEGOTIATION WITH A PART TIME JOB PORTAL BUT BEFORE THE CONTRACT IS ENTERED INTO. THAT THERE BE A LEGAL REVIEW BY. AN ENTITY SUCH AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WITH AN EMPHSIS ON IS TRYING THAT ARE PROVISIONS TO PROTECT THE STATE'S INTEREST AND MINIMIZE LIABILITIES. INCLUDING THE STRUCTURE OF THE STATE TO LEAD BEIJING STEP WITH THE CONTRACTED PARTNER. IT RECOMMEND MAKING THE ALLOCATION OF FUNDING CONTINGENT ON A THIRTY DAY REVIEW PERIOD BY THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE OF THE CONTRACTED TERMS AND- MILESTONES. AND SIX BECAUSE THE MINISTRATION HAS NOTED THAT THE PROPOSED FUNDING ALONE WOULD NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO IMPLEMENT. THE PROPOSAL WE RECOMMEND REQUIRING THAT THE CONTRACTED PARTNER DEMONSTRATE ABILITY TO RAISE SUFFICIENT CAPITAL TO COVER ANY REMAINING COST ASIDE FROM THE STATE'S. INVESTMENT AND THEN ONCE THE CONTRACT IS ENTERED INTO RECOMMENDER CLIMBING QUARTERLY UPDATES TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE. ON PROGRESS TOWARD THE CONTRACTIN MAY MILESTONES THIS WOULD ALLOW AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO EXERCISE OVERSIGHT. AND THEN FINALLY THE LOGIC FROM MIGHT WISH TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT THE BENEFITS AND TRADE OFFS. OF IT IT FOR POSTAL TO CONTINUE THE EXEMPTION OF STATE CONTRACTING ROLL THROUGH TWENTY THIRTY TWO RATHER THAN AND YOU HAVE AN ORDER OR DATE- THANK YOU AND HAVE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU I AM NOW GOING TO ASK- SECRETARY PETANI TO- ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE IN THE AGENDA OR IF THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE WHO YOU WERE ASSIGNING INSPECTIONS TO. THAT IS FINE AS WELL. SURE THANK THANK YOU DR- ARAMBULA TAKE ON A FEW OF THE QUESTIONS THAT ALTERNATE OVER LATER TO OUR CHIEF COUNSEL AT EACH CHIRON BUCKLEY- THE FIRST QUESTION- IN THE AGENDA WAS FOR- WELL PROVIDING A REACTION TO THE CONCERNS AND- RECOMMENDATIONS REYES BIO- SO I'D START OFF WITH- YOU NOTING THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL POLICY WINDOWS KIND OF ALIGNED TO MAKE IT APPROPRIATE. AND WORTHWHILE FOR THE STATE TO ADDRESS THE MARKET FAILURE OF AFFORDABLE INSULIN FIRST OTHERS GREATER LEGAL GROUP REGULATORY CLARITY. THE BIOLOGICS PRICE COMPETITION AND INNOVATION IMPACT- WHICH WAS ENACTED- AND TWENTY TEN VIA THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ESTABLISHES A CLEAR REGULATORY PATHWAY FOR PHARMACEUTICAL FIRMS TO BRING BIOSIMILARS TO MARKET- SO. THE VC PI HAS BEEN- DONE ON THE PATH TO IMPLEMENTATION SINCE THE MID TWO TWO THOUSAND TIMES AND THE FDA HAS SINCE PUBLISHED SEVERAL NOTABLE GUIDANCES ON BIOSIMILAR INTERCHANGE ABILITY LICENSING AND LABELING. THESE GUIDANCES HAVE PROVIDED MUCH NEEDED CLARITY. OR PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES THEREBY REDUCING OF BIOSIMILAR DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION COSTS THERE'S ALSO ONE EXISTING BIOSIMILAR INSULIN- THAT THAT HAS COME TO MARKET WHICH WOULD PROVIDE A TEMPLATE- FOR HOW OTHERS CAN REPLICATE THAT PROCESS. NUMBER TWO- THAT THERE'S BEEN POLICY ACTION TO ADDRESS THE HIGH COST OF DRUGS THAT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED AND THE GOVERNOR SIGNED AS BE A PART TO AS I AS I NOTED EARLIER. SO IN THE BILL- THAT THERE'S A REQUIREMENT THAT WE EXPLORE- PENCIL AND PROVIDED A VIABLE PATHWAY EXCESS- AND LASTLY- YOU KNOW BIG BASS OUR OUR OUR MARKET RESEARCH OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. WE HAVE FOUND THAT THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR- A VIABLE PATHWAY- SPECIFICALLY THAT THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONTRACT MANUFACTURING TO DELIVER LOW COST OR OUT COST MOST SIMILAR INSULIN PRODUCTS. THERE ARE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF UNCONVENTIONAL FIRMS AND START UPS STARTUP FIRMS WITH PROVEN TRACK RECORDS. THAT HAVE DEVELOPED ALTERNATIVE MODELS FOR DRUG DEVELOPMENT DISTRIBUTION AND PRODUCTION. MOST IMPORTANTLY THESE ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY CAN PARTNER WITH THE STATE. AND BRING BIOSIMILAR INSULIN PRODUCTS TO MARKET WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS. WITHOUT A PARTIAL INVESTMENT FROM THE STATE. AND NO PURCHASING COMMITMENTS WHILE BAY WOULD SHOULDER THE COST OF DISTRIBUTION AND ROLL OUT. A PARTNERSHIP VIA CONTRACT MANUFACTURING HAS THE SIGNIFICANT PROMISE OF SUBSTANTIAL SYSTEM WIDE SAVINGS- THAT HAS BEEN PRESENCE ONE COSTS COULD DECREASE DUE TO STEEP PRICE COME COMPETITION. AND THEN I'LL I'LL COVER THE THIRD QUESTION WE RECEIVE ON THE AGENDA ABOUT THE STATE- WHETHER THE STATE WOULD ON THE MANUFACTURINGFACILITY- THAT WOULD BE BUILT- SO IF THAT THE- CALAR EXPLOSIVE MORE INSULIN INITIATIVE USES THAT OUR CONTRACT MANUFACTURING APPROACH. THIS IS BECAUSE IT'S MORE EFFICIENT AND TIMELY IN BRINGING AFFORDABLE BIOSIMILAR AND SONS TO MARKET- AS WE MENTIONED IN THE PROPOSAL ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE COULD BE. MANUFACTURING BY THE STATE DRUG MANUFACTURING IS VERY COSTLY AND COMPLEX- SINCE THIS DAY WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE BUILDING ITS NON. PHARMACEUTICAL FIRM DOES WHAT INVOLVED YOU KNOW THE STATE DEVELOPING. AT THE DRUG SUBSTANCES IN PRODUCTS BUILDING AND MANAGING FACTORIES NAVIGATING THE LEGAL RIGHT OF OUR SYSTEM AND- DISTRIBUTING PRODUCTS CENTER WHOLESALERS AND PHARMACIES. THIRD THROUGH CONTRACT MANUFACTURING THE STATE LOWERS ITS REST BECAUSE THEY WOULD REQUIRE THAT THE CONTRACT MANUFACTURER TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE COST FOR THE INSULIN MANUFACTURING FACILITY. WE ANTICIPATE- THE TOTAL COST TO ESTABLISH A FACILITY BUILDING IN THE. RANGE OF A HUNDRED BILLION. I WHICH WHICH ENOUGH TO THAT PUTS CONSERVE WITH A REVIEW OF THE MARKET AND ENGAGEMENT WITH INDUSTRY EXPERTS. THE STATE WOULD CONTRIBUTE- HALF OF THIS COST FOR THE MANUFACTURING FACILITY WHAT WITH THE CONTRACTOR COVERING THE REMAINDER OF. SO THE- AND AS I NOTED EARLIER AND MY- REMARKS WE WOULD YOU KNOW DO THAT DUE DILIGENCE WITHOUT GO BESTED MINISTRATION AND GO THERE'S WORKING TOGETHER- TO CONFIRM IF MANUFACTURING FACILITY IS JUSTIFIED. WELL WE HAVE A STRONG PREFERENCE TO LOCATE THE FACILITY IN CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE IT IT DID- OPPORTUNITY FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AS A AS AN ADDITIONAL BENEFIT- WE CAN ALL STAR CONSIDERATION WE HAVE TO EXPLORE. INCLUDING WHETHER- A POTENTIAL CONTRACT MANUFACTURER MANUFACTURER HE HAS EXISTING CAPACITY IN LOCATIONS OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. SO TALENTED JUST WOULD MAKE THIS DECISION AND COORDINATION WITH CALLS AS- AND- THERE ARE CONTRACTING PROCESS WE'D INSURE THAT THE THAT THE CONTRACTOR CONTINUES TO. TO USE THE FACILITY TO MANUFACTURE INSULIN AT A LOW TRANSPARENT PRICE. AND BURKE FOR THE REMAINING REMAINING QUESTIONS ALTERNATE OVER TO RYAN BUCKLEY CHIEF COUNSEL AT AGE FIVE. GOOD AFTERNOON IS THIS ADDITIONAL ARAMBULA KLAY G. COUNCIL HERE H. GUY. FOR THE JOB BACK TO THE SECOND QUESTION WHICH WAS PLEASE EXPLAIN THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE PROPOSED PUBLIC CONTRACT CODE EXEMPTION. BEING FOR SUCH A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. I DIDN'T EXEMPTION IS NEEDED BECAUSE AGREEMENTS WITH CONTRACTING PARTNERS WILL BE UNUSUAL CONTRACTS THAT DID NOT FIT SQUARELY WITHIN DDS COURT RULES AND PROCEDURES. UNLIKE TYPICAL CONTRACTS THE STATE IS NOT DIRECTLY RECEIVING GOODS OR SERVICES AND CONTRACTS WE PERFORMED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE HIGHLY REGULATED COMPLEX INDUSTRY. BECAUSE OF THIS UNIQUENESS THE AGREEMENTS WE DIFFICULT FOR REVIEW UNDER NORMAL CONTRACTING PROCESSES WHICH MAY CAUSE SUBSTANTIAL DELAYS. THE TEN YEAR EXEMPTION IS NEEDED IF THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT FOR INSULIN HAS TO BE AMENDED BEYOND FIVE YEARS BECAUSE OF UNEXPECTED CIRCUMSTANCES EFFORT POWER ACCESS TO BE ABLE TO ENTER A PARTIAL. PUNISHES FOR OTHER DRUGS THEY'RE EXPERIENCING MARKET MARKET FAILURES BESIDES INSULIN THE EXEMPTION BUT- SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SB FIFTY TWO- ACROSS THE BOARD- D. EXEMPTION WOULD ALLOW THE STATE TO QUICKLY HIRE EXPERTS AND CONSULTANTS AS NEEDED TO ASSESS RESPOND TO DEVELOPMENTS AROUND. THE PROGRAM IN THE INDUSTRY. NEXT QUESTION BUT FOR ONE WHAT BIGELOW. WITH THE STATE FACE RESULT IN ITS AND WITH MANUFACTURER. AS ENVISIONED UNDER THE CURRENT B. C. P. THE STATE WOULD NOT BE OWNING A CONTROLLING ANY OF THE PRODUCTS WITH THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION TESTING DISTRIBUTION. SO THE RISK LIABILITY THE STATE IN THAT REGARD TO MINIMIZE. THESE GUYS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS RETAINING EXPERT COUNSEL TO ADVISE THESE KIND THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS TO CARRY OUT SB FIFTY TWO. IN THE MONITORING. AND MONITORING PERFORMANCE OF ANY AGREEMENTS AROUND THAT. NUMBER FIVE HOW THE STATE BE ABLE TO PROTECT ITS FINANCIAL INVESTMENT. IF ANY COMPONENT OF THE PROJECT FAILS. IN THIS REGARD WE THINK PREVENTION IS THE BEST MEDICINE IN EIGHT CO AX MITIGATE THE RISKS ON THE FRONT END. A. B. C. P. SISTER SHARE THE RISK AS A H. CAL WOULD NOT BE FUNDING THE FULL COST OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRODUCTS. WERE DISABILITIES. AND WITH EACH MILESTONE SHOULD BE CAREFULLY ASSESS ASSESSED AND DEFINING CONTRACT IN CONSULTATION WITH OUR OWN EXPERTS- AND SHOULD HAVE AN INHERENT VALUE TO THE STATE WHICH COULD BE THIS DISRUPTIVE VALUE ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS COMING IN THE PIPELINE OR COMPETITORS ENTERING THE MARKET- EACH MILESTONE SHOULD ALSO HAVE. VALUE EVEN IF THE CONTRACT DOESN'T END UP BEING FULLY PERFORMED AS REGIONALLY VISIONS WIFE IN CONTRACT THE BEST PROTECTIONSTO CLOSELY MONITOR THE CONTRACTORS PERFORMANCE PROVIDE FOR FINANCIAL COVENANTS AND CONDITIONS IN THE CONTRACTS THAT'S THE STATE. CAN HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE CONTINUED VIABILITY THE CONTRACTOR AND THE PRODUCTS PRIOR TO EACH DISBURSEMENT. AND WITH THAT HAPPY ANSWER FOR THE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DÍAS FOR ANY MEMBERS QUESTIONS WE WILL BEGIN WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER. YES THANK YOU- OR VERY SO MUCH- SO YOU KEEP USING THE WORD- CONTRACT EXEMPTIONS WHAT IS THAT. MEAN IS THAT NO BAD CONTRACTS IS WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO. YEAH THAT'S THAT'S CORRECT EXEMPTION FROM NEET THE USUAL- STAY CONTRACTING PROCESS. TO ALLOW MORE FLEXIBILITY ESPECIALLY IN REGARDS TO TIME. YEAH SO THAT MEANS NO BID CONTRACTS RIGHT WE'VE ENTERED YOU KNOW- OKAY SO IT'S A NO BID CONTRACT TO CONTINUE WITH MY COMMENTS LATER- THE OTHER QUESTION IS- THE- QUESTION WAS NOT ANSWERED IF THE STATE WILL ON THE- FACILITY IS THAT A YES OR NO. NO BECAUSE WE WENT THROUGH FIVE MINUTES OF JUST. SPEAKING TO AND THE ANSWER IS NOT SO WE WANT TO WIN BESTING THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ON THE FACILITY THAT WE WILL NOT. A FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE CURRENT BCP WILL BE DIRECTED TO A INVESTMENT OF FACILITY. SO WE EXACT OKAY SO FIFTIES I'M SORRY I'M CORRECTED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS UP TO A FACILITY THAT WILL NOT. THAT'S CORRECT OKAY AND THEN- SO. I BET THIS IS KIND OF OUT OF MY LEAGUE HOWEVER I DO HAVE NOW THAT WE'VE BEEN HERE UPS MY SIXTY YEAR I'VE BEEN HEARING NO BID CONTRACTS FOR A LONG TIME WE HAD THE YOU KNOW THE- FAILED- THEN- WITH THE VENTURA- CONTRACT WHERE WE INVESTED A WHOLE BUNCH OF MONEY ON ON A COVERT TESTING SO MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN REALLY GOOD ABOUT NO BID CONTRACTS. HAS NOT BEEN GOOD AT ALL ABOUT THIS IS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN CAP LAST YEAR- I SPECIFICALLY ASKED THE NUMBER OF TESTING MAYBE RELATED OR UNRELATED BUT MY POINT IS THAT I HEAR THE SAME THING THAT WE HEARD DURING THE WINTER A CONTRACT FOR- FOR COLBY TESTING- SO I JUST FEEL LIKE WE'RE INVESTING A BUNCH OF MONEY AND NINE THIRTY GETTING ANYTHING FOR OUR- OUR INVESTMENT- I KNOW THAT THERE'S A THING CALLED A PPM- SO HOW WILL THE STATE ENSURE THAT- WERE INCLUDED IN THAT- BILLS. M. FORMULARIES- IN ORDER TO- BE INCLUDED. AND KIND OF THIS WHOLE SYSTEM THAT IS REALLY COMPLICATED. I CAN TAKE THIS QUESTION- SO YEAH YOU YOU RAISE A GOOD QUITE A POINT ABOUT PBMS AND KIND AT HOW HOW THE INSULIN PRODUCTS WOULD BE COVERED SO- YOU KNOW CALAR ACTS WOULD WORK WITH THE MET CONTRACT MANUFACTURER TO ENSURE THAT THE PRICE OF THE ENDS LINES ARE NOT- INFLATED ALONG THE SUPPLY CHAIN- YOU KNOW THIS THIS THIS HAPPENED THE OUR CURRENT SYSTEM WHERE. YOU KNOW FROM GOING FROM THE MANUFACTURER TO THE WHOLESALERS TO PBMS OF THE PRICE INCREASES AT EACH POINT SO WE WOULD WORK TO ENSURE THAT- TECHNICAL. TAKES ACTIONS TO AVOID DOCTOR COTTON. THEY'RE HAVING TERMS WITH- ALL SAILORS AND PHARMACIES TO ENSURE PRODUCTS ARE PRICED- AT THE MANUFACTURER'S SUGGESTED RETAIL PRICE- THERE'S ALSO GOING TO BE- YOU KNOW WHAT WE CAN INCLUDE EFFORT SAID TO RAISE PUBLIC AWARENESS ABOUT THE- AVAILABILITY OF LOW COST. AND ONE FOR THOSE THAT ARE CURRENTLY EXPECTS IT TO THE HIGH WAS PRICE OF BRANDED INSULIN'S- AND THEN- IF FOR WHATEVER REASON PBMS AND HEALTH PLANS DO NOT COVER THE PRODUCT WE ALSO HAVE MAIL ORDER PHARMACY AVAILABLE BUT BUT FOR- WHAT WHAT YOU REYES ABOUT PBMS IS PARTICULARLY NOTEWORTHY BECAUSE- THERE ARE. THERE ARE A LOT OF POLICIES BEING PROPOSED- AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND AS WELL AS THE STATE OF INSULIN COPAY CAPS SO IF THOSE WERE TO BE ENACTED- THE CARD THAT PROVIDES BENEFITS TO CONSUMERS IN TERMS OF PREDICTABILITY OF OUT OF POCKET COSTS BUT IT ALSO SHIFTS THE COST TO HEALTH PLANS AND PBMS SO- YOU. BUT THE BETTER OF HAVING A LOWER. BIOSIMILAR INSULIN PRODUCT ON THE MARKET IS THAT HEALTH PLANS- WOULD HAVE MORE OF AN INCENTIVE TO COVER THAT PRODUCT SO THAT. BECAUSE THEIR CURRENT MORE OF THE COST- FOR COVERING THAT PRODUCT- HOW DID THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SENT TO COVERED ON THEIR FORMULARY. SO THAT THEY KNOW THE CONSUMER PICKS UP THAT PRODUCT- ON THE HEALTH PLANS EITHER TOTAL EXPENSES WOULD GO DOWN BECAUSE- THE PRICE OF THE PRODUCT IS FAR LOWER THAN THE GRANDDAD'S- AND THEN- YEAH AS I MENTIONED EARLIER YOU KNOW- IF. HI IF THE HEALTH PLANS AND PBMS ON COVER OF MAIL ORDER PHARMACIES ANOTHER OPTION- AND WE WOULD ALSO WORK WITH THE CONTRACTOR TO ENSURE THAT THAT NONTRADITIONAL RETAIL CHAINS- SUCH AS OUR GROCERY STORES OR OTHER TYPES OF VENUES WHERE WE'RE CONSUMERS FREQUENTLY SHOP- BUT THOSE COULD ALSO BE OPTIONS FOR PROTECTING THE PRODUCT. DR WOOD YEAH I JUST I JUST LIKE TO FOLLOW UP- YOU KNOW THE PBM ISSUE IS OF SIGNIFICANT CONCERN AND I'VE- I'VE WORKED ON THIS ARENA FOR A WHILE AND ONE OF THE CONCERNS I HAVE IS THAT. WE HAVE SEEN MULTIPLE EXAMPLES OVER THE YEARS WERE PBMS- WON'T TAKE A LOWER COST ALTERNATIVE ON OF THE FORMULARY BECAUSE THEY DON'T GET A BIG ENOUGH REBATE. THEY OPERATE IN THE REBATE WORLD AND SO IF WE'RE RELYING ON ON CITIZENS TO REQUEST THAT- THEN THEN THAT MAY BE OUTSIDE THE CONTRACT AGREEMENT THEY HAVE WITH THEIR INSURANCE COMPANIES AND SO ON AND SO THE PRICE MAY BE REALLY MAY BE REALLY. WHEN LIKELY WILL BE REALLY REALLY APPEALING. BUT THE WHOLE THE WHOLE OF THE AGREEMENTS WITH HEALTH PLANS AND PBMS INCLUDING OUR OWN STATE WHO HAS USES OPTUM. AS AS THAT ARE PRETTY COMPLICATED SO- IS GREASE SOME ASSURANCE THAT THERE'S SOMEBODY ACTUALLY WORKING ON THIS PART OF IT BECAUSE- IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAY INSTITUTE A THIRTY FIVE DOLLAR. YOU KNOW COPAY CAP- WHICH WHICH IS WHICH IS SIGNIFICANT THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THAT THAT THE FORMULARY WILL BE PICKED UP- EVEN THOUGH WE MIGHT PRODUCE IT FOR THIRTY DOLLARS. DO YOU SEE WHERE I'M GOING WITH THAT YEAH. YEAH THANK YOU WHERE AN HOUR. AT I DO KIND OF WANTED TO REFOCUS ON. CALM KIND OF WHAT WHAT THE CALORIE EXPIRES SIMILAR INSULIN PRODUCT WOULD BE IT WOULD BE PRETTY TRANSFORMATIONAL. BECAUSE IT WOULD BE A PRODUCT THAT'S BASED BASED ON COSTS SO. THE CONSUMER COULD IT BE APPROXIMATE THE CURRENT THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR PER ABOUT ISIS PROFILE PRICES CHARGED IN THE MARKET- UNINSURED CONSUMERS ARTS WASN'T UP FOR COST OF THAT. SO FOR US ABOUT COST PRODUCT- ARE COMING TO THE MARKET THROUGH THIS INITIATIVE. DOT DOT CONSUMER COULD PURCHASE IT ON THEIR OWN- ESPECIALLY ON AN UNINSURED CONSUMERS WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH PLANS- YOU KNOW THAT THE REBATE NEGOTIATED AMOUNT SUCH THAT THE HEALTH PLANS HAVE. SO THIS WOULD BE- REALLY DISRUPTING OUT SPACE- COULD YOU HAVE ONE PRODUCT ONE TRANSPARENT LOW PRICED- REGARDING HEALTH PLANS- MOST INSURED CONSUMERS- HI YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THEY HAVE- MOST OF THEM AT LEAST WITH GOOD COVERAGE TO HAVE- YOUR COPAYS OR COINSURANCE AMOUNTS THAT THA THEY NEED TO PAY AND THEN- BUT THE CONSUMERS THAT THAT HAVE A HIGH DEDUCTIBLE HEALTH PLANS WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN MET THAT DEDUCTIBLE THEY WOULD ALSO BE- SIMILAR TO THE UNINSURED CONSUMER HAVING TO BEAR THE WHOLE COST- BEFORE THEY YOU KNOW BEFORE THE HEALTH PLAN PICKS UP THE REMAINDER. SO FOR THESE TWO- TWO GROUPS CONSUMERS- IT WOULD BENEFIT THEM. FROM PROPOSED BY HAVING. ACCESS TO A LOW COST PRODUCT THAT THEY THAT THEY COULD PAY FOR OUT OF THERE ARE USING THEIR OWN OUT OF POCKET. FUNDS I GUESS WITH THE CHAIR JUST TO FOLLOW UP AND I AND I APOLOGIZE AND I'M PROBABLY GETTING WAY INTO THE WEEDS ON THIS BUT- BUT- BUT I. I YOU KNOW I WONDER OKAY SO YOU HAVE CONSUMERS WHO'S GOT A HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN- AND PRESUME OF HIS HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN SHOULD BE COVERING- THE COST. OF SOME OF THE COSTS FOR THE FOR THE FOR THE DRUG. BUT WE MIGHT WE MIGHT ULTIMATELY BE ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO GO OUTSIDE THEIR INSURANCE PLAN. BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOWER COST ALTERNATIVE. FOR THEM- IT WAS NOT QUITE AN OVER THE COUNTER BECAUSE IT'S A PRESCRIPTION- SO WE'VE GOT THIS SOMETHING THAT'S KINDA IN BETWEEN HERE. MEANWHILE THE PREMIUM REFLECTS. WHAT THE COST. SHOULD BE SO THAT'S GIVING AN ADVANTAGE TO THE INSURANCE COMPANIES- THE PBMS MAY NOT CARRY IT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GETTING A BIG ENOUGH REBATE. THERE SO SOME OPERATIONAL ISSUES HERE THAT ARE OF CONCERN- AND I YOU KNOW I JUST. I GUESS I'M HOPING THAT THERE'S SOMEBODY. REALLY LOKING DEEPLY AT THAT SOME OF THIS BECAUSE IT'S REALLY COMPLICATED. AND I'M JUST TOUCHING THE SURFACE OF THE SENATE AND I THINK YOU KNOW THAT. THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING WHERE WE'RE CONSIDERING AND LOOKING AT EXPLORING FURTHER- WE WHAT WE WILL AS PART OF THIS IS A NATIONALLY WE WILL BE. BRINGING ON AN EXPERT CONSULTANT TO HELP WITH THE STRATEGIC- WITH STRATEGY OPERATIONS- YOU KNOW IT'S ONE THING TO GET YOUR PRODUCT TO MARKET IT'S ANOTHER ENTIRE- IT'S ANOTHER SORT OF CHALLENGE. TO ACTUALLY GET IT IN THE HANDS OF CONSUMERS. SO WITH THAT AT EXPERT CONSULTANT THEY WOULD BE TASKED WITH FIGURING OUT STRATEGIES. FOR ENGAGING HEALTH PLANS AND PBMS ON ON HOW TO COVER COVER THAT THE CALORIE ACCENTS ONE PRODUCT. YEAH AND THEN JUST FINALLY BEGIN I KNOW THIS FROM I KNOW THIS IS HAPPENED I'VE TALKED TO- TO- SOME PEOPLE IN THE MANUFACTURING WORLD. THAT HAD ARTIFICIALLY IMP CREASE THE PRICE OF THEIR PRODUCT. TO BE ABLE TO APPEAL TO A PBM TO GET THREE THAT PBM INTERESTED TO REBATE. SO THEY COULD ACTUALLY PLAY IN THAT SPACE AND SO. THIS IS A REAL CONCERN THE PBM ISSUE SO- I JUST YOU KNOW ALSO STOP THERE BUT- IT'S POTENTIALLY PRETTY MESSY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO. WHAT THANK YOU DR ED FOR- I'M NOT IN IN THAT PROFESSION HOWEVER- I DO HAVE A CONSERVE OUR FIRST OF ALL- AS A TEACHER I CAN TELL YOU THAT HOPE IS NOT A STRATEGY. SO I'M NOT HERE ANY HEARING ANY STRATEGIES AS TO HOW THIS IS GOING TO BECOME AVAILABLE THE L. A. O.'S- CONCERNS I SHARE THE CONCERNS OF THE L. A. O. WE'VE ENTERED INTO NO BID CONTRACTS BEFORE SO THIS. EXPERT CONSULTANT THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WOULD BE UNDER NO BID CONTRACT AS WELL SO HOW. YOU KNOW. THE NUMBER OF ISSUE THAT ALREADY POPPING INTO MY HEAD. AS TO YOU KNOW HIRING THESE EXPERT CONSULTANTS BEING THE- KIND OF FIASCO THAT I EXPLAINED TO YOU EARLIER ABOUT. THE VENTURA FACILITY THERE WAS NO BIG CONTRACTS- AND THAT AS WELL THEY WERE NOT- FOLLOWING THROUGH WITH THE PROMISE OF. CHEAPER BECAUSE IT ENDED UP BEING THAT WE WERE PAYING MORE FOR THAT- THE COVERAGE HAS INSTEAD OF LEFT. THE FOR EXAMPLE ONLY U. S. T. AND- SAN DIEGO SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR PAYING LESS WITH OTHER. VENDORS AS WE WERE- PROVIDING THROUGH THE VENTURA CONTACTS SO IT JUST MAKES NO SENSE TO ME HOW WE CAN SAY NO BID CONTRACTS WHEN IT'S SUCH A- SENSITIVE ISSUE. AND TO THE POINT OF THE PBMS THAT DOESN'T GUARANTEE. SOUNDS GREAT THAT THAT FOLKS ARE GOING TO HAVE OF CHEAPER INSULIN- BY THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THAT BILLS WILL BE PAID FOR AND WHAT I HEARD YOU SAY. WAS THAT THE FOLKS THAT DON'T HAVE INSURANCE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THAT. WHO'S GOING TO. WRITE THE PRESCRIPTIONS FOR THIS MAGIC IN FULL AND THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE INSURANCE WHO'S GOING TO WRITE A PRESCRIPTION. FOR THIS CHEAPER BECAUSE YOU STATED. THAT FOLKS THAT DON'T. THERE'S NOBODY WRITING A PRESCRIPTION CONNECTION CAN YOU AT LEAST THAT I CAN. I CAN CLARIFY THAT THAT MEAN- UNINSURED- PERIODS CAN YOU KNOW COME IN A VARIETY OF FORMS AS IT COULD BE COVERAGE TRANSITIONS IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE AGING OUT OF YOUR PARENTS PLAN- IF YOU'RE BETWEEN JOBS- YOU KNOW THE OTHER. HERE IS COULD BE MORE LONG TERM ON INSURANCE SO. YOUNG PEOPLE YOU KNOW ARE COULD BE CONNECTED TO MEDICAL CARE- INTERMITTENTLY YOU KNOW HOW TO HAVE A PRESCRIPTION ALREADY ON FILE FOR THOSE MEDICATIONS IS JUST. YOU KNOW HAVING. WHAT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO MAKE THAT TRADE OFF BETWEEN. THEIR OTHER EXPENSES FOR AND HOUSING FOOD RENT ETCETERA THAT BY BRINGING BETTER THEIR COSTS LOWER FOR. AFFORDABLE AND SMALL AND- BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO- YOU KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THAT THEY DON'T HAVE A HEALTH PLAN WHERE THEY'RE THEY'RE PAYING- ACCESSING MEDICATIONS THAT WAY. SO FOR CONSUMERS YOU FOR SECOND SOUL DO YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL BE ON BENEFITING FROM THE FENCE. SO AS FAR A- THAT THAT'S SOMETHING WE'D BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP ON- ON IN TERMS OF LICENSES WHAT WHAT IT WOULD MEAN FOR INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER AND SAVINGS PROBLEM WITH THIS- YOU KNOW LIKE I THIS IS MY SIXTH YEAR HERE AND EVERY TIME WE SEE THE WORD TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT MEANS YOU DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER. AND IF WE'RE HERE REQUESTING FIFTY TO A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS I WOULD HOPE AND AGAIN HOPE IS NOT A STRATEGY BUT WE'RE USING THE WORD HOPE A LOT- THAT THAT WE WOULD HAVE THOSE NUMBERS SO THAT WHEN I ASK YOU THAT QUESTION- WE HAVE A CONCRETE NUMBER- WE CAN. SPEND ALL THIS MONEY ON ASSUMPTIONS AND WITHOUT HAVING ANY CONCRETE INFORMATION SO WHEN YOU SAY THAT THAT THIS WOULD HELP PEOPLE THAT ARE IN TRANSITION HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT I'M I'M THINKING MY COMMUNITIES IN BALDWIN PARK OR AND ALL MONEY ARE THE ONES THAT. ARE ARE NOT INSURED HAVE NOT BEEN INSURED AND HOW WOULD BE ACCESS PRESCRIPTION TO THIS YOU KNOW LOW INCOME LOW ALL COST IN FULL AND IT'S NOT CLEAR AND AGAIN- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. SUCH AN IMPORTANT CRITICAL CRITICAL- MEDICATION FOR YOU KNOW THAT THOSE FOLKS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU'RE NOT GIVING ME ANY ANSWERS AS TO HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL BE. BENEFIT FROM IT HI- IF WE CAN EVEN GET- THEM INTO THE PPM- WE'RE NOT OWNING THE FACILITY SO WE REALLY TECHNICALLY DON'T HAVE ANY AUTHORITY OVER IT WOULD. AND YOU SAID FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS HOW MUCH ONE VISIT IT FIFTY MINUTE MILLION DOLLARS PERIOD IS A FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. AND THEN SOME EXPERT CONTRACTOR THAT WAS HIRED UNDER A NO BID CONTRACT IS GOING TO SAY BY THE WAY WE NEED ANOTHER HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. IT'S WE'VE BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD BEFORE IN DIFFERENT SCENARIOS AND IT HASN'T TURNED OUT WELL. AND FROM WHAT I'M HEARING- YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE A PLAN YOU HAVE GREAT INFORMATION AND AGAIN MY FAVORITE LINE TODAY IS- CONTACT EXEMPTIONS AS OPPOSED TO NO BID CONTRACTS. BECAUSE THAT'S A REALLY DIFFERENT WAY OF SAYING WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY VETTING ALL OF THESE CONTRACTORS. AND SO. I CAN GO ON AND ON NINE I USUALLY DO BUT I'M NOT BUT I'M TELLING YOU THAT WHAT I'M HEARING IS NOT ANY CONTRACT UNTREATED. CONCRETE ANSWERS ON- HOW MUCH MORE MONEY IS GOING TO COST. WHO THE FOLKS TAT ARE GOING TO BENEFIT FROM THIS FAR THERE'S NO ANSWER TO THE PBM QUESTION- THERE'S NO ANSWER AS TO HOW MUCH MORE IT'S GOING TO TAKE IT SOUNDS GREAT BUT YOU'RE GOING TO CREATE. CLINICAL JOBS WITH YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE AND DO YOU HAVE A NUMBER ON HOW MANY JOBS IT'S GOING TO CREATE. WE HAVE SOME. KIND OF NUMBER AND NUMBERS ON TRACK IN TERMS OF. HOW MANY PEOPLE I WOULD TAKE HER TO OPERATE SUCH A FACILITY- BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT GOT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP. THANK YOU SO AGAIN I'M HEARING THE FOLLOW UP. YOU KNOW A CONSTANT FOLLOW UP IF YOU'RE- I DON'T YOU KNOW LOOK. I'M I'M- NOT- NEW TO THIS I GUESS IS MY POINT AND THE FOLLOW UP- AGAIN FOR ME MEANS- WE'RE GOING TO. STALL YOU UNTIL LATER. ON WHICH HAS HAPPENED ALREADY MANY MANY TIMES AND SO FOR YOU TO BE HERE ASKING FOR THIS KIND OF MONEY. IT'S ESPECIALLY WHEN THE ALLELES OFFICE HAVE. AMONG OPEN TO CONCERNS OF WHO'S GOING TO MANAGE THIS IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH AND I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE AND I WILL CONTINUE TO SAY IT AGAIN IF YOU HERE. ASKING FOR THIS KIND OF MONEY BE PREPARED BE PREPARED TO ANSWER THE QUESTION SIMPLY YES OR NO OR WHEN I ASK OR SOMEBODY ASKED ABOUT DATA AND WHO'S GOING TO BENEFIT FROM THIS. YOU'RE ASKING FOR FIFTY TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR WITH NO CONCRETE ANSWERS SO. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT WE'RE HERE AGAIN. WITH SUCH A COMPLEX ISSUE AND WE'RE NOT GETTING ANY ANSWERS NONE WHATSOEVER IT'S JUST REALLY GOOD WORDS LIKE- CONTRACT EXEMPTIONS IT'S GOING TO CREATE A WHOLE BUNCH OF JOBS IT'S GONNA BENEFIT LOW INCOME PEOPLE PEOPLE THEY CAN'T ACCESS IT AND YOU KNOW- PEOPLE OF COLOR I MEAN THOSE ARE THE BUZZ WORDS THAT THAT WE HERE- SO THAT WE CAN INVEST A WHOLE BUNCH OF MONEY IN THE LATER WE'RE GOING TO SAY I'M SORRY IT DIDN'T WORK OUT AND THEN IN THE MEANTIME. WE CAN BE USING THAT KIND OF MONEY- FOR EXAMPLE TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE- FOR DOCTOR ARAMBULA BILL- WHERE WHERE PEOPLE ARE BEING COVERED FIFTEEN OVER BEING COVERED I MEAN. IT'S I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE A BUDGET SURPLUS BY THAT WE'RE NOT BEING SMART WITH THE MONEY THAT WE HAVE WE'RE NOT ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE KIND OF THE LUXURY OF BEING ABLE TO IMPLEMENT SUCH AMAZING PROGRAMS AND TO HAVE A PROPOSAL THAT REALLY HAS NO I DON'T SEE THE VALUE IN IT BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE ANY CONCRETE INFORMATION THESE ARE PIE IN THE SKY KIND OF IDEAS WHICH I APPRECIATE THAT WE'RE THINKING OF QUOTE UNQUOTE OUTSIDE THE BOX HOWEVER OUTSIDE THE BOX MEANS. OUT MONEY THAT WE'RE SPENDING ON SOMETHING THAT MAY OR MAY NOT WORK AND IN THIS CASE I DON'T HAVE ANY KIND OF DATA THAT SAYS THAT THIS IS GOING TO WORK SO I'LL LEAVE IT THERE BECAUSE I KNOW I KNOW MYSELF SO THANK YOU- BUT I DO EXPECT THE FOLLOW UP ON- DATA DATA ON IF I I'M A NERD WHEN IT COMES TO DATE I'M A TEACHER AND MY DECISIONS ARE BASED ON NOT SO AS MUCH DATA AS YOU CAN GET ME ON SOME OF- THE QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE TO MAYBE THE QUESTIONS THAT I DIDN'T ASK LIKE WHO WHO'S WE- HAVE THE ARE YOU LOOKING INTO. HOW MANY CONTRACTORS IT GONNA TAKE TO IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO AND- TO ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION EARLIER I DON'T WANT TO. INTERRUPT- MANY TIMES ARE UNDOCUMENTED OR UNINSURED POPULATION COMES TO E. OURS AND SEES PEOPLE JUST LIKE ME TO GET THOSE PRESCRIPTIONS AND SO- DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE PROPOSAL AND FRAME IT AS RISK REWARD IF I CAN. AS THERE IS A REWARD TOWARDS FIGURING OUT HOW TO LOWER COST ON HOW WE CAN ENCOURAGE BETTER FOLLOWING OF THE DRUG REGIMENS AND DECREASE TKIS ARE SIGNIFICANT REWARDS FOR US BUT IT COMES WITH SIGNIFICANT RISK AND I THINK THE L. A. TOUCHED ON THAT WELL. THAT I BELIEVE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PROTECTING THE STATE'S INTERESTS WE HEARD FROM THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT THE NEED FOR US TO DEFINE MILESTONES. SO I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT OUR MILESTONES ARE WHAT ARE WE DOING WHAT DETAILS DO WE HAVE- THAT WOULD LEAD UP PRIOR TO FDA APPROVAL WHAT ARE WE GOING TO BE TRACKING AND FOLLOWING. PRIOR TO ENTERING INTO ANY CONTRACTS. CHERUB AROUND YOU I COULD START OFF AND PASS IT ON TO RHYME BUCKLEY- IF HE HAS ANYTHING TO ADD- SO FOR THE U. REGARDING MILESTONES WE HAVE- STARTED- WE DO HAVE A PLAN ON IN TERMS OF WHAT TYPES OF MILESTONES STATE BANK CLUED- ALLOWING AN APPLICATION. FOR FDA- READ CLINICAL. NOT SERVICE TERMINOLOGY USED FOR FDA CLINICAL TRIALS SO WHEN- WHEN THE STUDIES THREE BRIDGE SIR AND POINTS OR CHIEF CERTAIN CALLS THAT THAT THAT- THAT MEDICATION IS- YOU KNOW MEETING THE FDA'S REQUIREMENTS FOR PROACTIVE NESS. BURKE PER SE D. X. CETERA AND THEN ALSO FOR INTERCHANGE ABILITY. THAT IT THAT THAT THE PRODUCT COULD BE SUBSTITUTED FOR THE BROWN PRODUCT. SO BUT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE MILESTONES AT LEAST ON THE DEVELOPMENT SIDE- FOR THE MANUFACTURING SIDE THERE'S ALSO OTHER MILESTONES RELATED TO- SITE SELECTION AND- FINDING- YOU KNOW I'D GET CAPITAL EQUIPMENT PURCHASES XCERRA SO THOSE ARE KIND OF WHATEVER OF WHAT TYPES OF MILESTONES THAT WE WOULD TIE- PAYMENT TO- AND ADULT THE WAY WHAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT IS IT IS A GATED. OF PAYMENT OR MILESTONE SCHEDULE. WE KNOW ALTERNATE OVERRIDING YES ANYTHING THAT. YEAH I DON'T I DON'T HAVE MUCH TO ADD TO THAT IS THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA LEAN ON OUR OUR EXPERT COUNSELING OR INDEPENDENT CONSULTANTS TO DEVELOP THE DETAILS AROUND THOSE MILESTONES AND MAKE SURE WE HAVE THOSE- CAREFULLY DEFINED IN THE CONTRACT AND ALSO A PLAN AS TO HOW WE'RE GOING TO VERIFY. WITH CERTAINTY THESE MILESTONES BEEN THAT ALONG THE WAY. I WOULD LIKE TO PULL IN THE L. A- TO SEE IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THE MILESTONES. THANK YOU- YES WE HAVE ANYTHING THOSE MILESTONES ARE A GOOD STARTING POINT- ESPECIALLY AGAIN UP TO THE DEVELOPMENT STAGE. AND GETTING THAT ACTED APPROVAL- HOWEVER THERE'S- LIKELY GOING TO BE SEVERAL MORE MILESTONES THAT NEED TO BE FLUSHED OUT FOR THAT PROCESS. I'M NOT JUST TO GET TO THE FDA APPROVAL BUT THEN ONCE YOU GET PAST THE FDA APPROVAL. HOW DO YOU ENSURE THAT THE FACILITY IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO PRODUCE OPT OUT VOLUME. HOW DO YOU HAVE THE- RANGE IS MADE TO THE PLANS. YOU KNOW THE PLANNED ARE WILLING TO PERSON THAT YOU HAVE A BUSINESS MODEL THAT'S GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL- MANY MANY MORE STEPS THAT NEED TO GO IN THE PROCESS THAT- WE THINK IT. WOULD BE CRITICAL FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF HOW NOT. FUNNY WILL GUARANTEE THAT THEY WILL SUCCEED THROUGH ALL THOSE MILESTONES AND SORRY THANK YOU. ALONG THOSE LINES IF I CAN WE HEARD HOW THE CONTRACTS CAN BE DIFFICULT TO REVIEW AND I OFTENTIMES LACK. TRANSPARENCY THAT I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE L. A. RECOMMENDATION ABOUT GETTING A LEGAL REVIEW. FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS THERE. A RATIONALE FOR WHY WE WOULD NOT WANT TO DO THIS IN A PUBLIC SPACE TO ENSURE THE- MOST AMOUNT OF TRANSPARENCY AND OVERSIGHT THAT WE CAN HAVE. I THINK IT IT COULD BE DONE TO AN EXTENT IN A PUBLIC SPACE I MEAN IT WE WON'T KNOW UNTIL WE GET INTO THE NEGOTIATION WITH SOMEBODY'S POTENTIAL PARTNERS- TO WHAT DEGREE THEY WANT TO KEEP THEIR THEIR BUSINESS PLANS- YOU KNOW CONFIDENTIAL PROTECT. PROTECT PROPRIETARY INFORMATION THAT WAY BUT UP I THINK THERE'S DEFINITELY A SPACE FOR THAT- NO WE ALREADY IN OUR PROCESS OF LOOKING TO RETAIN. OUTSIDE EXPERT COUNCIL WE'VE ALREADY BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE AG'S OFFICE IN EVEN JUST GETTING THE CONSENT TO RETAIN OUTSIDE EXPERTS. WITH THAT IN SEEING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW FROM THE DYESS- I WOULD SAY THAT IT. APPEARS THERE'S MUCH MORE CONVERSATION WHICH NEEDS TO OCCUR TO MAKE SURE WE ARE MITIGATING ANY UNFORESEEN RISKS AND WOULD APPRECIATE AN ABILITY TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE SURE THAT- ULTIMATELY THE FINAL DECISION IS REFLECTIVE OF ALL OF OUR CAN PUTS- INCLUDING THE LEGISLATORS. WITH THAT WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ISSUE- FIVE AND I WILL THANK VERY MUCH PANEL FOR. WE ARE NOW MOVING ON TO PROPOSALS FROM DH CS THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE% SERVICES PANEL FIVE IS ON THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BRIDGE HOUSING PROGRAM BCP WE HAVE ONE PRESENTER AND G. C. COOPER WAS THE STATE MEDICAID DIRECTOR. AND CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR AT DH CS DEPUTY DIRECTOR COOPER PLEASE BEGIN YOUR- SCHIZO YOU CAN HEAR IT. GOOD AFTERNOON A CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE A FIRST I WANT TO STOP IN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT IS NATIONAL MENTAL HEALTH IN THE MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS MONTH SO JUST WANTED TO ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE FIRST TOPIC JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. I THINK GIVEN WHAT EVERYONE HAS GONE THROUGH THROUGH COVETED OTHER THINGS THE IMPACT ON BOTH OUR CHILDREN AND YOUTH AND ADULTS IS HUGE AND APPRECIATE ALL THE INVESTMENTS IN DISCUSSIONS AROUND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- TODAY- IN REGARDS TO THE BRIDGE HOUSING B. C. P. THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUESTING SIXTEEN POSITIONS- WITH FIVE YEAR EXPENDITURE THIRTY. OF FORTY TWO MILLION JUST DOLLARS GENERAL FUND. IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE TO ADMINISTER THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BRIDGE HOUSING PROGRAM. WHICH PROVIDES IMMEDIATE HOUSING AND TREATMENT NEEDS FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING UNSHELTERED HOMELESSNESS. IS SERIOUS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. DCS ALSO REQUEST PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE TO ALLOW FUNDS TO BE AVAILABLE FOR AND COVERED SYNDICATE UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN. JUST TO BE CLEAR. I'LL GO THROUGH SOME OF THE COMMITTEE'S QUESTIONS AS WELL IN THE NOTE OPEN TO ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. A SO YES DH CS IS VERY READY TO HIRE QUICKLY. A WE HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY PREPARING ALL OF THE DOCUMENTS THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO HIRE AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE. I WOULD JUST NOTE MARLEY'S PRESENT HER TEAM DOES A REMARKABLE JOB- THAT PREPARING FOR MANY OF THESE PIECES SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DID IN B. H. C. I. P. OR THE CONTINUUM. PROGRAM WE ARE ALREADY ON ROUND THREE OF FUNDING. A LAST YEAR AFTER APPROVAL WITH THE BUDGET WE HAD STAFF HIRED DOLLARS FOR ROLLING BY AUGUST OF THAT YEAR. AS TO THE SAME TEAM WILL BE RUNNING- THIS PARTICULAR PROJECTS SO I'M VERY CONFIDENT IN THEIR ABILITY TO DO THIS. THEY HAVE LEARNED SIGNIFICANTLY UP FROM THAT INFRASTRUCTURE AND PUT FORWARD. A FOR THOSE PIECES. ADDITIONALLY YES THE DEPARTMENT DID ENGAGE WITH A HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS EXPERTS IN REGARDS TO LEARN FOR THIS INITIATIVE. AS WELL AS OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CALLING IN REGARDS TO THE REAL GAPS THAT EXIST. IN REGARDS TO WHAT WE NEED HERE WE ALSO DID EXTENSIVE RESEARCH IN REGARDS TO CURRENT AND PAST SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IN REGARDS TO THE TYPES OF SERVICES INDIVIDUALS WHO. HAVE SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH ILLNESS AT NEED WE ALSO HAVE HEARD THAT WHILE THERE HAS BEEN EXTENSIVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR HOUSING DURING THE COVERED- AND IN THE LAST FW YEARS. ADDITIONAL SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL MENTAL- SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES REALLY ARE NEEDED AND SO. I REALLY A CRITICAL INVESTMENT. I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE BRIDGE HOUSING IS USE FOR TO BOTH PURCHASE INSTALL AND OPERATE TINY HOMES. AS WELL AS THE OPERATING FOR BRIDGE THE BOTH ITEMS ARE INCLUDED IN THERE. AND NOT JUST THE TINY HOMES AS AN OPTION. AS WELL AS OTHER SETTINGS INCLUDING RESIDENTIAL ADULT SENIOR CARE SETTINGS. A TINY HOMES ARE JUST ONE OF THE OPTIONS FOR THE BRIDGE HOUSING DOLLARS. A TO PROVIDE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WHO HAVE SERIOUS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. I WOULD SAY THE EXTERNAL EXPERTISE DH CS IS SEEKING IN OUR VARIOUS CONTRACTS AS YOU SEE HERE. IS REALLY THAT REAL ESTATE ACQUISITION OF THE CONSTRUCTION MONITORING THOSE ARE THINGS THAT AS YOU WOULD IMAGINE- WE DO NEED CONSULTING WE HAVE GOTTEN GREAT CONSULTING IN THAT WORK AROUND SOME OF THE B. H. THE I. P. DOLLARS WE'VE DONE AND SO WE FEEL CONFIDENT IN SOME OF THOSE. A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE DEPARTMENT AS WELL- I WOULD ALSO JUST NOTE THAT YES WELL THE DEPARTMENT CONSULTS WITH MANY STATE DEPARTMENTS IN REGARDS TO THIS WE HAVE HAD HISTORICAL SUCCESS ESPECIALLY WITH THE- GRANTS TO HAVE BEEN ROLLING OUT FOR THE TWO POINT TWO BILLION ON THE B. H. THE I. P. AND FEEL CONFIDENT WE'D BE ABLE TO SUPPORT OUR COUNTY PARTNERS- WITH THESE CONTRACTS AS WELL. THAT RESULTS IN MY COMMENTS AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DÍAS FOR ANY MEMBERS QUESTIONS. I WAS EXCITED TO RECEIVE THIS AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE ON GOING DISCUSSIONS. WITH THAT WE WILL THANK VERY MUCH PANEL NUMBER FIVE IN PANEL SIX IS ON THE CALLIE. PCP AGAIN WE HAVE ONE PRESENTER CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR JC COOPER.

AND WE ARE HOPING TO COME TO CONCLUSION OF THOSE NEGOTIATIONS HOPEFULLY BY THE END OF JUNE OR EARLY JULY AT THIS POINT IS WHAT WE ARE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATING. AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU. THANK YOU I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DIESS FOR ANY MEMBERS QUESTIONS. I WOULD LIKE TO ONE HI I'M QUITE INTERESTED AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THAT OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING OF OUR- MANAGED CARE PLAN SO THAT WE CAN HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE CAN I HEAR FROM THE ITS THE- SOME OF THE STRATEGIES. ON HOW WE CAN ENSURE THAT WE'RE HAVING PROPER OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING OF OUR PLANS SURE SO WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED A ROBUST GO POST GO LIVE REPORTING MECHANISM. THE DATE IT'S BEEN COMING IN WE'VE BEEN COLLATING IT- THE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND REALLY WE ARE VERY COMMITTED TO PUBLICLY POSTING THAT SO PEOPLE CAN SEE THE IMPLEMENTATION TRENDS THE UTILIZATION TRENDS- OF THOSE VARIOUS PIECES. WE ALSO HAVE BEEN CONDUCTING A POST GO LIVE SINCE WE WENT LIVE IN JANUARY OF A PROVIDER ROUND FEEDBACK LOOP. TALKING TO PROVIDERS DIRECTLY TO UNDERSTAND NOT JUST WHAT WE HOPE TO IMPLEMENT AND TO. YOU KNOW TO DO WITH CAL AND WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING ON THE GROUND SO THE TEAM HAS ACTUALLY DONE AROUND OF. A FEEDBACK LOOPS AND WORK SESSIONS WITH PROVIDERS WHO ARE PROVIDING ENHANCED YOUR MANAGEMENT OR COMMUNITY SUPPORT AND REALLY THE INTENT THERE IS FOR US TO LEARN EARLY. WHERE THE ISSUES THIS IS VERY COMPLEX- WORK THAT WE'RE DOING- NEW RELATIONSHIPS NEW ACROSS THE BOARD. AND SO WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT JUST PULLING DATA THAT THE PLAN SUBMIT TO US YOU KNOW THEY HAVE TO SUBMIT A TON OF POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO US. THE DATA SO THAT WE CAN SEE TRENDS ON THE OUTSIDE BUT ALSO WE'RE DOING A FEEDBACK LOOP WITH OUR PROVIDERS REALLY TO HEAR FROM THEM WHAT'S WORKING WHAT'S NOT. WE HAVE AT THE TEAM JUST BRIEF ME THE OTHER DAY AN EXTENSIVE LIST OF OPPORTUNITIES ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. AND SO WILL BE MAKING SURE THAT WE MOVE FORWARD ON THOSE IN KEEPING CLOSE EYE. I WOULD LOVE TO FOLLOW UP NOT HERE DURING THE HEARING BUT ON M. O. R. SPECIFICALLY ON HOW WE CAN ENSURE WERE HAVING THE TRANSPARENCY. AGAIN FOR MANAGED% CARE PLANS THAT ARE SUB CONTRACTING I. BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO. HAVE THAT LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT AND SO LOOK FORWARD TO THAT HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN A CONVERSATION. WITH THAT I WILL THANK VERY MUCH PANELS SIX AND E WILL NOW MOVE ON THE PANEL SEVEN WHICH WILL COVER THE MEDICARE ALL ENTERPRISE SYSTEM. MODERNIZATION WILL HAVE TWO PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL INCLUDING LAURIE WALKER DEPUTY DIRECTOR. AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER OF FISCALE AT DH CS. AND BRIAN METZGER PRINCIPLE FISCAL AND POLICY ANALYST WITH THE L. A. L. WHAT'S BEGIN WITH DEPUTY DIRECTOR WALKER. AFTERNOON I IN THIS PROPOSAL DH CS IS REQUESTING FIVE PERMANENT POSITIONS UNLIMITED TERM FUNDING FOR CONTRACT RESOURCES. TOTAL EXPENDITURE THIRTY IS TWENTY POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS WHICH EQUATES TO TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FEDERAL FUNDING. FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. FOURTEEN MILLION A TOTAL FUNDS TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION GENERAL FUND OF FISCAL YEAR TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. AND A MILLION DOLLARS TOTAL FUNDS TWO HUNDRED AND FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS GENERAL FUND IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. TO SUPPORT ONGOING INFORMATION MODERNIZATION EFFORTS- WE CURRENTLY RECEIVE NINETY TEN ENHANCE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR MODERNIZATION OF OUR SYSTEMS WHICH IS CRITICAL FOR MINISTERING OUR PROGRAMS. I JUST TO CLARIFY THE NARRATIVE AMOUNT IN THE AGENDA REPRESENTS TOTAL EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY AND IT WAS NOT CLEAR IN THE AGENDA OR IN OUR B. C. P. AND THE CONTRACTOR THIRTY MOUNTAINS THE NINETEEN POINT SEVEN MILLION. THIS DIFFERENCE REPRESENTS THE AUTHORITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIVE POSITIONS THAT INCLUDES SALARY BENEFITS OPERATING EXPENDITURES AND EQUIPMENT. THIS RESOURCE REQUEST SUPPORTS ACTIVITIES FOR THE FOLLOWING APPROVED PROJECTS IN THIS FORMATION TECHNOLOGY EFFORTS CONTINUED WORK TO DEVELOP AN OVERALL MODERNIZATION STRATEGY MOVE FROM THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE INTO SOLUTION DESIGN DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT. FOR THE NEW CALIFORNIA AUTOMATED RECOVERY MANAGEMENT SOLUTION. AS WELL AS CONTINUE WORKING THROUGH THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE FOR THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH MODERNIZATION PROJECT I WORK SPECIFICALLY ON STAGE THREE WHICH IS PROJECT PROCUREMENT. DHS'S APPROACH TO MODERNIZATION UTILIZES IN AB TRIAL BASED pMETHODOLOGY. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS ADVOWSON INTERIM REPROACH TO PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT THAT HELPS TEAMS DELIVER. VALUE TO THEIR CUSTOMERS FASTER AND WITH FEWER ISSUES. TYPICALLY SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT IS DELIVERED IN WHAT WE CALL A WATERFALL APPROACH WHERE YOU GET ALL OF IT AT THE VERY END. WHAT HAPPENS WITH AN AGILE METHODOLOGY AS DTS DELIVERS WORK IN SMALL AMOUNTS AND CONSUMABLE INCREMENTS FOR THE PROJECT. AND AS NOTED IN THE AGENDA THE L. A. S. SUPPORTS REQUEST BUT RECOMMENDS THE LEGISLATURE DOT PROVISIONAL BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT REQUIRES THE AGENCY HAS TO SUBMIT ITS INITIAL STRATEGY FOR THE MES MODERNIZATION EFFORT. BY THE END OF TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. DMCS CURRENTLY PROVIDES MES MODERNIZATION UPDATES DURING QUARTERLY LEDGE BRIEFINGS AND ANNUAL BUDGET REQUESTS AND WE BELIEVE THAT THERE SUFFICIENT. AND LANGUAGE CURRENTLY IN PLACE ALLOWING THE TYPE OF INFORMATION NOTED IN THE ALLEY- RECOMMENDATION TO BE PROVIDED REGULARLY. AND THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO PRESENT BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. HELLO BRIAN METZGER IS THIS OKAY THAT ONE SORRY. LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN. ALL RIGHT- BRIAN METZGER LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE HAVE NO SPECIFIC CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL IS NOTED BUT RECOMMEND APPROVAL WITH PROVISIONAL BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT TO SUBMIT ITS INITIAL STRATEGY FOR THIS EFFORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ODD MES MODERNIZATION EFFORT WILL UPDATE AND OR REPLACE MANY OF THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS THAT SUPPORT THE STATE'S MEDICAL PROGRAM. AN INITIAL STRATEGY WILL OUTLINE THE GOALS AND OUTCOMES AND TARGETS FOR THIS EFFORT PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT OPERATIONAL PROCESSES AND WORKFLOWS DECIDE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE EFFORT AND START TO EXPLAIN HOW ALL OF THE PROJECTS WITHIN THIS EFFORT WILL BE DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED. SUBMITTING THIS DOCUMENTATION TO THE LEGISLATURE WILL HELP TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EFFORT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND MITIGATED AND HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO COMPLETE THIS EFFORT AND AT WHAT COST. IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERS THIS LANGUAGE TO BE POTENTIALLY DUPLICATIVE OF CURRENT BUDGET-BILL LANGUAGE THAT REQUIRES QUARTERLY MEETINGS WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS AS WELL AS UPDATES ON NEW CONTRACTS-WE THINK MODIFYING THIS LANGUAGE TO SPECIFY THAT THE STRATEGY DOCUMENTATION MUST BE DELIVERED BY THE END OF THE BUDGET YEAR WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND CLARITY AS THIS EFFORT MOVES FORWARD. I WITHOUT HAVING TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU WE WILL BEGIN WITH DOCTOR WHAT. THANK YOU- FOR THE OVERVIEW ON THIS ITEM- I'VE GAINED A LOT OF APPRECIATION FOR HOW IMPORTANT MODERN AND MODERNIZING MODERNIZING OUR MEDICAID THEIR PRICES SYMBOL MES- IS. FOR ABILITY TO ADMINISTER THE LARGEST MEDICAID PROGRAM IN THE NATION SO QUESTION- CAN M. M. E. S. B. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF TO SUPPORT THE DATA SHARING SIDE OF CALAMP. I LIKE THINGS LIKE MAKING SURE THE HEALTH PLANS AND PROVIDERS RABAL EXCHANGING USE CLINICAL RECORDS AND CLAIMS DATA. TO PROVIDE WHOLE PERSON CARE FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE MEDICARE OUR PATIENTS. YEAH EXCELLENT QUESTION WE DO HAVE ARE CHEAPER AS CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER ARE AVAILABLE REMOTELY CHRIS RECENT COULD ASSIST WITH THE THREE. CAN WE HAVE THE CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER FOR DH CS. J. C. K. AS WELL. I GUESS WHAT I'M WHAT I'M LOOKING AT HERE IS CAN WE ARE WE ARE WE ABLE TO COMBINE THESE PRIORITIES TOGETHER THAT THINK THEY ARE. BOTH IMPORTANT. HEY CHRIS RESEND IT TO CONFIRMATION OFFICERED ACS YOU GUYS HEAR ME OKAY. YEAH OKAY SO. TO HAVE TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE THAT IT THE MES DOES SUPPORT THE ITEMS THAT YOU BROUGHT UP- AND AS WE GO THROUGH AND MODERNIZE THIS THE OVERALL AMERIGAS WHICH IT WHICH REPRESENTS ALL OF THE SYSTEMS THAT SUPPORT MEDICAID INCLUDING FOR EXAMPLE- ON THE DATA SIDE THE WAREHOUSE OR THE DATA WAREHOUSE AND THE RELATED SYSTEMS THAT PROVIDE DATA- IT IT WILL SUPPORT THAT- CAL AIM REALLY REPRESENTS MORE OF THE BUSINESS SIDE OF THINGS- IN THE CHANGES FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE AND- ASSOCIATES SYSTEM CHANGES AND SO WHEN WE WORK ON ALL OF THIS WE TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT. AND THERE WON'T BE OVER LACK OF EFFORT OCCURRING. HE SAID IT CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OR CAN YOU CAN DO IT BUT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THERE'S A- COMMITMENT TO ACTUALLY DOING THAT THE REASON UP I'LL BRING IT UP IS IT JUST SAVE IF WE'RE NOT GOING TO COMBINE THESE ISSUES I THINK WE'RE MISSING. A UP AN OPPORTUNITY- I'M PRESSING ON THIS- A LITTLE BIT. LET LEARN OTHER STATES ARE DRAWN DOWN- IN THOSE INCREDIBLY- GENEROUS MES FUNDS FOR THIS TYPE OF DATA FOR THE DATA TAPE DATA SHARING INFRASTRUCTURE NETWORKS THAT. COULD COULD POTENTIALLY DELIVER SO THAT YOU CAN DO IT BUT I DON'T I'M NOT HEARING THAT WE'RE NECESSARILY GOING TO DO IT- BECAUSE CAL AT SOAP AND I'VE GOT SOME NOTES HERE SO I'M GONNA READ THIS RATHER THAN SCREWED UP OKAY. SO BUT- IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT CALIFORNIA. WITH FOR SOME REASON HASN'T PURSUED THIS TYPE OF A COMPREHENSIVE PROJECT IT FEELS LIKE. WE DO THIS MAYBE ADD ON LATER ON BUT NOT BUT PUT IT ALL TOGETHER AND MY MISSING SOMETHING THERE. I'M NOT EFFORTS I'M NOT TAKING ISSUE WITH THE B. C. P. I MORE TAKING I'M MORE WANT TO KNOW IS THIS A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH OR WE GONNA START WITH SOMETHING AND TRY TO ADD. ADD SOMETHING ON BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK OUT GREAT. YES WHAT'S THE LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT THE STRATEGY IS THAT WE USE THAT I'M LAURIE AND BRIAN WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER. SO THE OVERALL STRATEGY FOR IMPLEMENTING THESE CHANGES ENHANCEMENTS IMPROVEMENTS- AT TIMES MAYBE REPLACEMENT OF SYSTEMS. IN THE END THE **** IS ONE THAT WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE OVER TIME SO WHAT WE DELIVER. AT THE END OF TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE IS VERY IS REALLY THE INITIAL- STRATEGY AND ROADMAP BUT REALLY WHAT ALL OF THIS REPRESENTS IS AN UNDERSTANDING OF BEING STRATEGIC ABOUT HOW WE DO MODERNIZATION OF THE SYSTEMS. IT'S ALL BASED AND- AND IT'S ALL BASED ON BUSINESS PRIORITIES THAT WILL BE SET BY CAL AMY AND THEIR EFFORTS. THAT WILL DRIVE THE BUSINESS PRIORITIES THAT GETS TRANSLATED INTO AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT PARTS OF THE M. YES WE NEED TO MODERNIZE pAND WEBER. AND SO WHEN I SAY CAN I GUESS WHAT I MEAN IS THAT THOSE PRIORITIES THAT GETS THAT BY- THE DEPARTMENT AND THE ADMINISTRATION IN TERMS OF WHERE WE'RE GOING WITH MEDIC COW WILL WILL WILL DRIVE THE ROAD MAP. THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER AND ALL OF THAT COMES TOGETHER AND CONTINUES TO EVOLVE OVER TIME AS THOSE BUSINESS PRIORITIES CONTINUE TO CHANGE OR BE UPDATED- AND SO. ALL OF THE SO AND I DON'T KNOW THE DETAIL IN TERMS OF THE- SPECIFICS OF THE DATA THAT YOUR THINKING ABOUT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. BUT IT DOES ALL TIED TOGETHER AND WE WILL BE WORKING ON THESE THINGS IN FACT TO DATE IS ONE OF THE KEY ASPECTS OF WHAT UNDERLIES THE. ENTIRE AND THE S. AND ALLOWS US TO BE A TO THE WORK THAT WE PLAN TO DO TO MODERNIZE STAR SO SOUNDS LIKE YOU CAN DO THIS BUT WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS. AT I'M ACTUALLY I COULD ASK KIND OF ASKING CAN THE ADMINISTRATION TO BE BOLDER ABOUT THIS AND TRY TO- HE CAN DO IT HE SAID THEY CAN DO IT YEAH BUT CAN THE IS THERE A WILL TO DO AND THE REASON IS A LOOK I'M SPONSORING A NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS- SHOULD. HAVE DATA SHARED EQUITY- PACKAGE FOR MEDIC CAL ON BEHALF OF A LARGE COALITION OF PLANS AND PROVIDERS AND HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGES AND SO. A LARGE PART OF THE PACKAGE A ISSUES AND YES TO SUPPORT- H. I. EASE AND THE DATA INFRASTRUCTURE FOR CALAMP- FORGET MY CARE MANAGEMENT POPULATION HEALTH AND SO ON SO YES WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS. IS THERE A WILL. TO LEVERAGE. HUGE POTENTIAL FEDERAL MATCHES IN THIS- IN AND TAKE A BOLD STEP IN THAT DIRECTION OR- ARE WE GONNA JUST KIND OF BUILD THIS THING AND LITTLE PIECES AND HOPE IT ALL COMES TOGETHER AND FUNCTIONS THE WAY. WE WANTED TO- SO YOU KNOW I'D APPRECIATE IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY- AND THE STAKEHOLDERS EVERYONE TO REALLY TALK ABOUT THIS. MAYBE A BOLDER APPROACH- THAT WE COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THINGS UP FRONT. COMPREHENSIVELY INSTEAD OF. YOU KNOW BUILDING THAT KIND OF AS WE GO ALONG YEAH I THINK WOULD CHRIS IS MENTIONING IS THERE'S BEEN SO MANY CHANGES IN MEDICARE ALL RIGHT I THINK WE ARE TRYING TO USE THIS PROCESS TO IDENTIFY LINK. CALLEVA IS A CORE COMPONENT FOR EXAMPLE ON THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SIDE WE HAVE MULTIPLE SYSTEMS THAT PLAY IN TWO TO THAT SIDE OF THINGS- THROUGH THIS WORK WE'RE HOPING TO KIND OF IDENTIFY HOW DO WE MODERNIZE THOSE SYSTEMS SO THEY ARE. MORE EFFICIENT SO THAT COUNTIES ARE ENTERING INTO MULTIPLE WAYS USING MULTIPLE SYSTEMS TO TRACK ALL THE DIFFERENT FUNDS WHETHER IT'S OUR MEDIC HALLER AND THEY JUST SAY OR THE BLOCK GRANTS THERE'S LITERALLY DIFFERENT SYSTEMS FOR THOSE AND SO I THINK. I THINK THE UNDERLYING THAT IS. THE GOAL OF WHAT CHRIS'S OUTLINING CALLIN AS ONE OF THE LARGE OPPONENTS IN ADDITION TO OTHER THINGS IN THE DEPARTMENT THAT WILL BE A PART OF THAT PROCESS. I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT- THE POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT SERVICE THAT WAS APPROVED IN THE BUDGET LAST YEAR WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY A HUGE IMPROVEMENT WHICH WERE HOPING TO LAUNCH IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE WE'RE WILL BE USING ALL OF OUR AT LEAST ADMINISTRATIVE DATA. DATA FROM SISTER DPARTMENTS INTO THE SYSTEM FOR PLANTS PROVIDERS AND BENEFICIARIES TO BE ABLE TO HAVE FULL ACCESS TO THEIR MEDICAL SERVICES. ULTIMATELY THE FUTURE WE'D ALSO LIKE TO TIE INTO THAT- YOU KNOW A CLINICAL DATA THROUGH H. I. USE AND OTHERS ON THAT MAY HAVE TO BE A PHASE TWO BUT IT'S IN THE CONVERSATION OF WHAT WE WANT TO PULL INTO. A INTO THE-THE SERVICE IN THE FUTURE IN WE ARE DRAWING DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS FOR THAT INITIATIVE WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE FEDERAL PROCESS AND THAT WOULD BE A PART OF THIS LARGER STRUCTURE. THAT CHRIS AND HIS TEAM ARE LEADING IN REGARDS TO HOW DO WE LEVEL OUT SOME OF OUR SYSTEMS AND YOU KNOW ABILITY TO PULL THAT DATA IN. YOU KNOW MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO ALL THE RIGHT PEOPLE- AND SO HAPPY TO KIND OF CONTINUE THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU AS YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE BEST WAYS THAT WE CAN MAXIMIZE THE DATA THAT WE HAVE. ACROSS ALL OF MEDICAL. SO SOUNDS LIKE WHEN I'M- AT THE BOLD APPROACH I'M LOOKING FOR PUT IT ALL TOGETHER IS GOING A. B. FACED. POTENTIAL I WOULD IMAGINE IT'S DEFINITELY GONNA BE PHASE BUT I WILL DEFER TO KRISTA IN REGARDS TO UNDERSTAND ONE OF TRAFFIC CONCEPTUALLY LOOK THERE'S FEDERAL FUNDING OUT THERE WE WANT TO MAXIMIZE AS MUCH AS WE CAN WORK AND SO WE HAVE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH THAT FEELS LIKE WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET THAT FUNDING A LITTLE EASIER THAN. YOU KNOW. ADDING ON MODULES AS WE GO FORWARD I JUST THAT'S THAT'S WHERE I'M GOING WITH THIS YES THAT I DON'T KNOW. THE L. A. O. HAVE COMMENTS ON THAT YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT. YO KNOW WHAT TOUCH THAT ONE. COME ON PEOPLE. NO I THINK I THINK IT SPEAKS TO OUR AND BIOMETRIC LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND AGAIN SPEAKS OUR RECOMMENDATION ABOUT THE NEED TO DELIVER THIS INITIAL STRATEGY TO THE LEGISLATURE. SUCH THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT. THE GOALS THE OUTCOMES THE TARGETS FOR THIS OVERALL PROCESS ARE. SUCH THAT IF WE WERE TO INCLUDE OTHER COMPONENTS. SUCH AS SAID YOU KNOW DIFFERENT WAYS OF LOOKING AT DATA DIFFERENT WAYS OF TAKING ADVANTAGE OF- KIND OF. THE DATA LED EFFORTS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE UNDERWAY. IT COULD BE DISCUSSED AS PART OF A- OF A LARGER. KIND OF STRATEGY DOCUMENT THAT THEY PLAN ON HAVING AVAILABLE BY THE END OF THE BUDGET YEAR. YEAH I GUESS IS THE CHIP CHALLENGES I MEAN WE OFTEN SO YOU KNOW WE OFTEN START ON THESE INITIATIVES AND WE DON'T COSTARRED COLLECTING THE DATA SOON ENOUGH OR WE DON'T SOMETIMES. OUR PROGRAMS WE KNOW OF THAT ARE COLLECTING DATA OR COLLECTING DATA NOT DOING ANYTHING WITH THAT. AND SO YOU KNOW FOR ME I'M THINKING CAN WE NOT COLLECT THE DATA REAL TIME USE IT AND HELP TO- YOU KNOW MAKE THE SYSTEM MAKE THINGS WORK IN A MORE ROBUST AWAY. RATHER THAN GETTING IT STARTED THEN IN DO YOU SEE WHERE I'M GOING OR I DON'T. YEAH I HOPE I HOPE SO I JUST. IT'S FIVE I JUST FEEL IT JUST FEELS MORE STRATEGIC AND IN THE LONG RUN AND POTENTIALLY MORE- BENEFICIAL- AS BRING. ABLE TO ANALYZE THAT DATA AS AS WE'RE GETTING IT RATHER THAN WAITING. AND ADDING TO IT. ALL OF THIS AND I'M GOING TO GET THAT MEANS WAY LOWER. WAS SPEAKING TO AND HER OPENING NOTES WHICH IS. THAT'S EXACTLY WHY. OUR INTENT IS TO DELIVER THIS OVER TIME AND DO IT IN AN INCREMENTAL FASHION WHERE WE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE. OF BOTH THE MODERNIZE SYSTEM THAT WE PUT IN PLACE AND ALSO THE DATA THAT MAY BE TIED TO IT- SO THAT WE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL OF THAT. EARLY AND OFTEN AS OPPOSED TO. WAITING FOR TEN YEARS TO DEVELOP. A NEW SYSTEM THAT ENCOMPASSES EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. THAT THAT SORT OF APPROACH DOESN'T PROVIDE US VALUE WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING AS LARGE AS THE MES. WHAT APPROACH GETS AS THE OPPORTUNITY TO DROP BROWN'S MUCH FEDERAL FUNDING AS WE CAN THAT'S WHAT I'M AFTER IT. AND THAT'S WHAT ON I WILL SAY THAT'S WHAT WE DO WITH THESE EFFORTS RIGHT WE MAXIMIZE NINETY TEN ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF. THIS EVERY OPPORTUNITY THAT WE CAN. EIGHT AND JUST SO THAT WE'RE CLEAR- WERE UTILIZING FEDERAL FUNDING TO HELP SUPPORT. THEIR ORGANIZATIONS IN THE STATE OTHER PROJECTS IN THE STATE AND THAT SAME WAY SO THERE IS A VERY. GOOD EFFORTS TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS WHERE WE CAN TO SUPPORT. THE MES AND THE MODERNIZATION OF THEM YES. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE CHAIR AND I WILL FOLLOW UP JUST BECAUSE I. BELIEVE IT WARRANTS IT EARLIER YOU SAID THAT THE STRATEGY ON MODERNIZATION. JUST RECENTLY SAID THAT WE WANT TO MAXIMIZE FEDERAL. FUNDS THAT WE PULL DOWN. DO WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHEN OR WHEN. FEDERAL MONEY IS NOT. OR IT IS AVAILABLE FOR US. INTO WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE. UNDERTAKING CERTAIN PROJECTS. DO YOU MEAN ARE WE MAKING DECISIONS THAT'S CORRECT DO YOU MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON WHETHER OR NOT- YOU GET IT 90% FEDERAL MATCH DOES THAT THEN CHANGE OUR ABILITY TO CREATE A STRATEGY. WELL IT IT WON'T IT WON'T CHANGE YOUR ABILITY TO CREATE THE STRATEGY AND I WILL SAY- GETTING FOR EXAMPLE THE NINETY TEN MATCH FROM FROM CMS FROM OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS. ONE MORE JEWISH IT PROJECTS. IT IS NOT NECESSARILY CHALLENGING IT CAN BECOME CHALLENGING WHEN WE ARE FOR EXAMPLE TRYING TO DO A PROJECT THAT IS BUILDING SOMETHING THAT'S TO CLICK IT IS A BIG OF ANOTHER PROJECT AND WE'VE SEEN THIS A FACT- WITHIN CALIFORNIA WINE CMS. GAVE US SPECIFIC DIRECTION AROUND THE STATE ARMY WELFARE SYSTEMS RIGHT CAL SAWS AND DIRECTED US TO GET TO A SINGLE SYSTEM RIGHT SO THEY DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR FUNCTIONALITY MULTIPLE TIMES ARE DUPLICATE SYSTEMS THEY WANT PAY ONCE. BUT AS LONG AS WE'RE MEETING THEIR ACT THOSE SORTS OF EXPECTATIONS GETTING NINETY TEN FUNDING FOR THESE IT PROJECTS IS NOT IS NOT REALLY WHERE THE CHALLENGE LIES IT'S REALLY IN THE DOING OF THE PROJECTS BECAUSE THEY'RE LARGE AND COMPLEX- AND SO. THAT THE STRATEGY. ITSELF WON'T. ONE NEXT REALLY ABOUT THE VISIT UNDERSTANDING OF THE BUSINESS PRIORITIES AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO MEET THOSE AND HOW THE SYSTEMS GET MODERNIZED. AS WE BEGIN TO TACKLE EACH PART THAT'S WHEN WE REALLY APPROACH THE FUNDING BECAUSE CMS ALSO LOOKS AT EVERY ALL OF THIS FROM A VERY MODULAR VIEW. AND SO THEY WANT TO BROKEN DOWN INTO PIECES AND THEY FIND IT BASED UPON THOSE SMALLER PIECES BUT IS THAT YEAH BUT IF YOU HAD MORE FUNDING COULD YOU THEN DO MORE PIECES. DOESN'T THAT CHANGE OUR STRATEGY THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I'M REALLY TRYING TO GET OUT HERE. CAN YOU ADVANCE FASTER IF WE'RE PULLING DOWN 90% FEDERAL MATCH AND WHY ARE WE NOT MAXIMIZING THAT IN AN ATTEMPT TO. HAVE THE CHANGE WE KNOW NEEDS TO HAPPEN- SEE A PROBLEM WITH THOSE FEDERAL DOLLARS. ALL THE PROJECTS IN THERE AND THE MES MODERNIZATION ARE NINETY TAX. SO WE ARE PULLING DOWN NINETY TENANTS FUNDING IN ORDER TO SUPPORT ALL OF THIS AND WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO WORK. BUT I ALSO THINK THERE'S A CERTAIN CAPACITY THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY- SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTE ON AND I DON'T THINK IT'S REALLY BASED UPON. THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING OR THE NINETY TEN FUNDING IT'S THAT THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CHANGE THAT. WE ALL ARE ABLE TO HAVE TO DO IT BASED UPON BUSINESS AND PROGRAM PRIORITIES AND SO WE'RE REALLY BILL HOLD ON THE TECHNOLOGY SIDE RIGHT WE'RE REALLY BEHOLDEN TO THE CHANGES THAT. ARE REPRESENTED WHETHER THROUGH A LAME OR OTHER YOU KNOW PROGRAM EFFORTS- AND THE DRIVING OF THOSE IN ORDER TO DO THIS WORK- I DON'T THINK USING AN ANALOGY IT SEEMS THAT YOU'RE OUT BAND WITH FOUR OF THE CAPACITY OF CHANGED NOW. AND THAT INCREASED RESOURCES WOULD NOT LEAD TOWARDS INCREASED CHANGE IS THAT. THE CORRECT SUMMATION OF WHAT YOU JUST SAID. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE NECESSARILY IT IS THE RIGHT NOW WHERE WHERE WE'RE AT IS THAT. WE SPENT THE LAST COUPLE YEARS BRINGING TOGETHER VARIOUS MODERNIZATION PROJECTS IN ORDER TO HAVE A MORE ENTERPRISE APPROACH OR AN APPROACH THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE BROADER UNDERSTANDING OF THE M. S. SOME OF WHAT WE WERE TALKING TOUCHING ONEARLIER. AND NOW THAT WE'VE DONE THAT WORK WE'VE BEEN WORKING TO BUILD THE STRATEGY THAT WILL REALLY HELP US TO- ALSO BETTER UNDERSTAND MAYBE WHAT THAT CAPACITY IS THAT YOU'RE TOUCHING ON. AND UNDERSTAND HOW WE WILL EXECUTE ON ALL OF THE CHANGES IT'S A LARGE AND COMPLEX SYSTEM TO DO WHEN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE HANDLING IT IN AN APPROPRIATE WAY- AS WE HEARD EARLIER THESE ARE AGILE BASED. SYSTEMS WHICH MEANS IT IS TO BE AN ITERATIVE APPROACH AND WOULD ENCOURAGE. THE LEGISLATURE TO PLAY AN ACTIVE ROLE IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND WANT TO UPLIFT AND SUPPORT THE COMMENTS OF DR WOULD HERE TONIGHT. WITH THAT I WILL THANK VERY MUCH ISSUE SEVEN WE WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE A. OUR STATE TO. PANEL EIGHT IS ON THE COVERT NINETEEN PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY ON RESUMING REGULAR OPERATIONS BCP WILL HAVE 1% ARE ON THIS PANEL DEPUTY DIRECTOR LAURIE WALKER WITH DH CS PLEASE BEGIN THANK YOU AT THE FCS IS REQUESTING THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM RESOURCES EQUIVALENT TO EIGHT POSITIONS CONTRACT EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY EQUAL TO TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR A TOTAL EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY OF TWENTY SIX POINT TWO MILLION WHICH IS THIRTEEN POINT ONE MILLION GENERAL FUND. T. ONLINE THE A PER THE ARRAY OF PROGRAM POLICY RELATED SYSTEM CHANGES THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE DURING THE COURSE OF THE COVETED AND PANDEMIC AND MINIMIZE ANY POTENTIAL DISRUPTION THAT COVERAGE TO MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. IN ANTICIPATION OF THE WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH THE COVER NINETEEN PHD UNWINDING IN THE REDETERMINATION WORK THAT COUNTIES WILL HAVE TO DO. THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE INCLUDED A HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS ACROSS TWO YEARS RELATED TO COUNTY ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROCESSING OF THE REDETERMINATION CASELOAD. DCS HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY WORKING WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION ON ASSESSING WORKLOAD FOR COUNTIES THROUGH COUNTY SERVICE. DMCS WILL BE EVALUATING THE RESULTS OF RECENT COUNTY SURVEYS ON RESOURCES AND COLLABORATE WITH C. W. T. ON NEXT STEPS. DCS IS ALSO WORKING WITH IT EVERY PROVIDING GUIDANCE AND TOOLS FOR THE COUNTIES TO ASSESS THEIR READINESS FOR THE UNWINDING ACTIVITIES. THEY MUST UNDERTAKE WHILE STILL ADDRESSING INCOMING APPLICATIONS AND ONGOING MANAGEMENT OF EXISTING CASES. THROUGH THIS PROPOSAL GIVES YES TAKING A PROACTIVE APPROACH TO KEEP THIS POPULATION INSURED BY PROCURING AN ANNEX AN EXPERIENCED VENDOR TO EDUCATE AND RAISE AWARENESS FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. TO UPDATE THEIR CONTACT INFORMATION WITH THEIR COUNTIES. AND TO ALSO MAKE AWARE THE IMPLICATIONS OF THEIR ELIGIBILITY TO THE EXTENT THAT THEIR NON RESPONSIVE TO REQUESTS FROM THE COUNTY'S REGARDING RENEWALS FUNDS TO COVER PHD AND CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE OUTREACH MATERIALS IN LETTERS TO BE MAILED TO OUR APPROXIMATELY FOURTEEN POINT SIX MILLION BENEFICIARIES. AND TO DISSEMINATE THESE MATERIALS TO OUR MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS COUNTIES ENROLLMENT NAVIGATORS AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS. THE PARTICULAR VENDOR WILL AUGMENT THE RECENTLY LAUNCHED PHASE COMMUNICATION CAMPAIGN TO REACH BENEFICIARIES WITH IMPORTANT MESSAGES. ACROSS MULTIPLE CHANNELS WITH TRUSTED PARTNERS DHS CALLS COVERAGE INVESTORS. THIS CALL THE NINETEEN PHD ONLINE COMMUNICATION AND OUTREACH CAMPAIGN WILL ROLL OUT IN TWO PHASES TO PRIORITIZE AND SEQUENCE STRATEGIES TACTICS AND MESSAGES ACROSS THE STATE TO PREPARE FOR RESUMPTION OF NORMAL MEDICARE ELIGIBILITY OPERATIONS. PHASE ONE CURRENTLY UNDER WAY IS TO ENCOURAGE BENEFICIARIES TO PROVIDE UPDATED CONTACT INFORMATION INCLUDING NAME ADDRESS PHONE NUMBER AND EMAIL SO THE COUNTY CAN CONTACT THEM. WITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT KEEPING THEIR MANA CAL. THE OUTREACH TOOLKIT IS AVAILABLE NOW ON DHS'S WEBSITE FOR DOWNLOAD. IN PHASE TWO DH CS WILL CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE ME- BENEFICIARIES TO UPDATE THEIR CONTACT INFORMATION AS WELL AS REPORT ANY CHANGES IN THEIR PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES. CHECK THEIR MAIL FOR UPCOMING RENEWAL PACKETS. AND SHOULD THE COUNTY BE UNABLE TO COMPLETE THE RENEWAL USING INFORMATION ALREADY AVAILABLE TO THEM TO COMPLETE AND TO HAVE WITHOUT HAVING TO CONTACT THE BENEFICIARY. THIS PHASE WILL BEGIN SIXTY DAYS PRIOR TO THE END OF THE COVERT PEACHY. A FACE TO OUR REACH TOOK IT WILL ALSO BE RELEASED TO ASSIST STATE AND COUNTY EFFORTS. DSDS IS ALSO ASSESSING FEDERAL FLEXIBILITY IS THAT CAN BE LEVERAGED TO HELP ASSIST WITH RENEWALS. TO MINIMIZE COVERAGE LOSS THIS FLEXIBILITIES WERE OUTLINED IN FEDERAL GUIDANCE AND ROSALIE'S BACK IN MARCH REGARDING UNWINDING ACTIVITIES AND STEPS STATES CAN TAKE TO HELP PROMOTE CONTINUITY OF COVERAGE AND MINIMIZE COVERAGE LOSSES DURING THE TERMINATION PROCESS. THAT'S IT HAPPY TO ANSWERING. THANK YOU I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DÍAS TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY MEMBER QUESTIONS I WILL START IF I CAN- I WAS MOVED ON PAGE FIFTY SEVEN OF THE AGENDA- THAT. IT STATES THAT THE PENDING CASE. ACTIONS FOR REDETERMINATION WILL BECOME PARABLE TO IMPLEMENTING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IN TERMS OF WORKLOAD. AND DOES WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE APPROPRIATELY RESOURCE. WITH THE- COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION TO DO THIS WORK AND WE HEARD IT WAS A HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX MILLION I BELIEVE. THAT THE COUNTIES RECEIVED LAST YEAR IT FOR ESTIMATING THERE ARE THREE MILLION BENEFICIARIES WHO COULD GO INTO THE REDETERMINATION PROCESS. IS FIFTY DOLLARS ANOTHER PER BENEFICIARY FOR US TO. B. ENSURING THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN HELP HOW DO WE ENSURE SO ALL WE ARE AT THE RIGHT NUMBER STARTED- I'LL START AND THEN RENEE MULLIN A BILL TO JUMP INSIDE ACTUALLY IF A CORRECT THAT WE WILL ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO. REDETERMINATION ON ALL FOURTEEN POINT WHAT NOW IS SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE- IN THE PROGRAM- WE ARE OUR CURRENT EX PARTE PERCENT IS AROUND 36% ACTUALLY DECREASED WITH COVETED- AND SO WE ARE LOOKING AT A NUMBER OF FEDERAL FLEXIBILITY THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY ALLOW US TO INCREASE THAT. STILL HAVING CONVERSATIONS AROUND WHAT THOSE WOULD LOOK LIKE WE PLAN ON RELEASING IN MID MAY- COMPREHENSIVE ON WINDING APPROACH- FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE ARE APPROACHING THIS- ESSENTIALLY SO WE WOULD WANT TO GET AS MANY AS WE CAN THROUGH THAT EXPERT TAKE PROCESS. WITHOUT HAVING TO THEN DO REDETERMINATION- I THINK- WE ARE ANTICIPATING THAT ANYWHERE FROM TWO TO THREE MILLION THOUGH CURRENTLY WITHIN IT WILL RESULT IN NOT BEING- POTENTIALLY STAYING ON THE PROGRAM. I DO TOO AT SOME POINT DEPENDING ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY ENDS WE GET HAVE ANYWHERE YOU KNOW AS A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH BUT AS YOU KNOW IT BUT SIZEABLE NUMBER THAT WE THINK WON'T MOVE FORWARD- FOR NUMBER OF REASONS PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD AT THREE- IN ROMANS NOT TAKE PLACE AT THE POINT OF TOUCH- THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF YEARS WITHOUT RE DETERMINING INCOME AND OTHER PIECES. I WE ALSO KNOW SIGNIFICAN NUMBER HAVE EITHER HAD HEALTH COVERAGE ALREADY- AS WE'VE HAD THAT INFORMATION AS WELL SO I THINK WE DO ANTICIPATE A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT OVERTIME OVER THE FULL TWELVE PLUS AT THE WE FOURTEEN TOTAL- MONTHS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL REDUCTION IN THE CURRENT CASE LAW THAT WE HAVE. WE HAVE SAFE. IN REAL. TO BE UPDATING US ON WHETHER OR THE COUNTIES ARE APPROPRIATELY RESOURCE. I JUST HAVE CONCERNS WHEN THERE ARE. SO MANY. PATIENTS POTENTIALLY WHO COULD LOSE THEIR INSURANCE THIS NEXT YEAR. THE WE'RE DOING ALL WE CAN IN ADVANCE YEAH I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR WHAT THAT STRATEGY OR PLAN LOOKS LIKE SO- WE ACTUALLY WERE ABLE TO SEEK AN APPROVED. I GOT APPROVAL FROM CMS DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY THAT WE WILL HAVE TO TOUCH EACH APPLICATION THREE TIMES WE WILL ONLY HAVE TO TOUCH IT ONCE FOR THE PURPOSES OF ID WHICH IS A HUGE DEAL BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE WORKLOAD WOULD HAVE BEEN. SUBSTANTIAL FOR THE COUNTIES- WE ORIGINALLY DID THE ESTIMATE KNOWING THAT. WE WOULD HAVE TO DO ANYWHERE FROM ONE TO TWO PLUS TOUCHES AND SO I CURRENTLY WORK CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE COUNTIES ON WHAT IS THAT RIGHT AMOUNT- YOU KNOW. IN OUR TOUCH RENEE COULD PROBABLY TALK MORE IF SHE'S AVAILABLE IN REGARDS TO HOW DO WE- USE TYPICAL STANDARD METHODOLOGIES FOR TOUCHES IN REGARDS TO HOW WE ESTIMATE THE COUNTY WORK BASED ON KIND OF. THE WITH A CASE STUDY AND OR TIME STUDY INTO THOSE PIECES. SO I THINK THOSE ARE THE BIGGEST PIECES THE OTHER THING IS- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS X. EXPECTING A STANDARDIZED REPORT TO THEM AS WELL- WE WILL ALSO HAVE A STATE. LOOK AT THAT WHAT DOES THIS LOOK LIKE EVERY SINGLE MONTH WHICH WILL INCLUDE. WHAT IS OUR PERCENT OF EX PARTE HOW MANY RENEWALS ARE OUT HOW MANY HAVE BEEN COMPLETED AND HOW MANY HAVE BEEN DISTANT ROLLED. WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN BETA TESTING THE REPORTS ALREADY- IN ANTICIPATION OF WHEN THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND SO THAT WE CAN BE VERY TIMELY WITH THAT REPORTING AND BE TRANSPARENT TO WHERE WE'RE SEEING PEOPLE. MAYBE NOT RESPOND SO WE ARE TRYING TO BE PROACTIVE IN THAT WAY. I WOULD APPRECIATE IF WE COULD HAVE COUNTY LEVEL DATA AS WELL. HAVE THE POTENTIAL THAN TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH OUR COUNTIES TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO. WORK TOWARDS THAT GOAL OF MAKING SURE WE CAN COMPLETE ALL THE RE TO TERMINATIONS- WITHOUT- WITH AS- MINIMAL AMOUNTS OF DISRUPTIONS AS POSSIBLE. WITHOUT I WILL THANK VERY MUCH ISSUE EIGHT AND WE WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NOT. PANEL NINE IS ON THE MANAGED CARE PLAN COMPLIANCE AND OVERSIGHT PROGRAM B. C. P. AGAIN OUR PANELISTS LAURIE WALKER DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER WITH DH CS THREE PLEASE. THE FCF IS REQUESTING FOURTEEN PERMANENT POSITIONS AND EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY A THREE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS ONE POINT IX MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE FOR THE EXTENSIVE AMBLED NEW CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS AND EXPECTATIONS. OF THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS THAT ARE EFFECTIVE JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. THIS NEW MANAGEMENT NEW MANAGED CARE PLAN CONTRACTING POSE A SIGNIFICANT NEW AND ENHANCED OBLIGATIONS ON ON MANAGED CARE PLANS. WITH THE DEPARTMENT MUST ENFORCE. THE POSITIONS OF EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY REQUESTED ARE TO MONITOR OVERSEE AND HOLD MC PEACE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS THAT ULTIMATELY RESULT. FROM THE PROCUREMENT EFFORTS LEGISLATIVE CHANGES FEDERAL CHANGES OF OTHER POLICY CHANGES AFFECTING THE MEDICAL POPULATION. IT'S CRITICAL THAT DCF HAVE RESOURCES AND STAFF TO COMPLETE THIS WORK FLOW. FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO BE READY FOR THEM NEEDED ROBUST COMPLIANCE AND OVERSIGHT MECHANISMS IN TIME FOR TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. WE NEED TO INITIATE EFFORTS BEGINNING IN JULY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF ENHANCED REQUIREMENTS OF THE CONTRACTS INCLUDE CONTRACTUAL COMPLIANCE NOT JUST WITH THE PRIME PLAN WITHIN DHS HOLD THE CONTRACT. BUT ALSO EXPLICITLY REQUIRED CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENTS TO FLOW DOWN TO SUBCONTRACTORS. AND DOWNSTREAM CONTRACTORS WHERE APPLICABLE. THEY'LL BE ADDITIONAL REPORTING AND DELIVERABLES MC PEACE MUST SUBMIT TO DH CS FOR REVIEW AND APPROVAL. ANOTHER CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENT FOR. THE MANAGED CARE PLANS TO REPORT ON THEIR DELEGATED ARRANGEMENT ON THE COMPLIANCE AND DELEGATION OVERSIGHT PLAN. THIS REQUIREMENTS TO ENSURE DCS HAS A FULL VIEW OF DELEGATION ARRANGEMENTS FOR. THAT ARE CONTRACTING MINSI PIECE HAVE WITH THE OTHER ENTITIES THAT PROVIDE CARE AND SERVICES TO THE MEDICAL MEMBERS. THIS IS A NEW REQUIREMENT DHS ON THE TO ESTABLISH PROCESSES TO EVALUATE THE SUBMISSIONS AND MONITOR CHANGES OVER TIME. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR CONTRACT WILL REQUIRE HIM SHE PIECE TO HAVE MEMORANDA OF UNDERSTANDING WITH LOCAL PARTNERS SUCH AS LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES. THE SEMI USEFUL INCLUDE NEW COMPONENTS SUCH AS QUARTERLY REPORTING CONFLICT RESOLUTION PROCESSES BETWEEN I'M- YOU PARTY'S ANNUAL SUBMISSION. DFAS WILL NEED TO DEVELOP REPORTING TOOLS IN ORDER TO REVIEW AND ASSESS COMPLIANCE ISSUE GUIDANCE PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE MANAGED CARE PLANS AND ENFORCE CORRECTIVE ACTION WHEN COMPLIANCE IS NOT MET. THESE NEW CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS ALSO REQUIRED EACH DH CS TO SET UP AND MODIFY SYSTEM TO SUPPORT DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. AS WELL AS RAMP UP FOR AN INCREASE IN AUDIT INVESTIGATION ACTIVITY. LEGAL ACTIVITY PERTAINING TO CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS ADVERSE ACTIONS SANCTIONS A RECRUITMENT ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DÍAS FOR ANY MEMBERS QUESTIONS UP I WILL BEGIN IF I CAN- I'M GONNA START IF I CAN- WITH THE RECENT FINDS THAT WE HAD ON L. A. CARES AS A BACKDROP- IN LIGHT OF US HAVING THE LARGEST FINDS WE'VE EVER. HAD ON THE MANAGED CARE PLAN. DOES THE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT WE HAVE FROM THE STATE- PROVIDE SUFFICIENT- OVERSIGHT OVER THESE MANAGED CARE PLANS HOW DID WE DETERMINE THIS WAS THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT FOR US TO- RESOURCE WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THIS IS FORWARD LOOKING I'M GOING TO BE AFTER JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WITH THEIR NEW CONTRACTS AND COLLEEN- STILL WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER WE HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO HAVE THAT OVERSIGHT. I CAN RESPOND TO THAT SO I THINK THERE'S A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING WE- WE HAVE EXISTING STAFF AND THEN WE LAST YEAR YOU GUYS OF FUNDED US AND STAFF FOR THIS WORK AS WE FINALIZED THE PROCUREMENT WE IDENTIFIED THAT WITH THE ASK LAST YEAR WE DIDN'T PROBABLY ASK FOR THE ROBUST LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT THAT WE ACTUALLY PUT INTO THE PROCUREMENT. ESPECIALLY NOW THAT WE'RE GOING DOWN FOR MANY THINGS ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE DELEGATED LEVEL AND IN IN ADDITION TO THE EXTENSIVE STUFF PRIME PLANS WILL HAVE TO SUBMIT TO US THAT THE DELEGATED LEVEL WE NEED STAFF WHO CAN ACTUALLY LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE IT YOUR POINT EARLIER IF YOU WE JUST RECEIVED IT AND FILE IT DON'T ACT ON IT DIDN'T THEN WHY ASK FOR IT AND SO. I WE ARE ACTUALLY DOING A SOUP TO NUTS REVIEW OF OUR FULL OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING OF OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS- TO MAKE SURE THAT DATA COMING IN IS BEING ANALYZED AND ACTED UPON- IN MAKING A NUMBER OF CHANGES THAT WILL TAKE TIME FOR US TO IMPLEMENT- BUT WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT CHECKS AND BALANCES IN PLACE THAT WE'RE ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS- WE'RE ALSO IN LIGHT OF. THE ALLEY CARE I DON'T EVEN LOOKING AT OUR AUDITING TOOL DO WE NEED TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS OR EVEN CHANGES TO THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF ITEMS FIND AS YOU SEE ON OUR WEBSITE NAY AUDITS OF WHERE WE ERE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFY A SOME OF THESE DEFICIENCIES AND ACT ON THEM- BUT WE CONSTANTLY ARE LOOKING AT THAT EVALUATING THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY THINGS EARLIER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT PUTTING BENEFICIARIES AND HARM- WE HEARD ABOUT HELP. PREVENTION IS THE BEST MEDICINE AND ENSURING THAT WE HAVE A CONTRACT THAT WE CAN ENFORCE. WITH THESE MANAGED CARE PLANS SIMILARLY WILL. BEST EMPOWER US TO HAVE THE APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY THAT WE NEED ON THE PLANTS- I WILL STATE THAT I FOUND IT DEEPLY TROUBLING TO HEAR FROM THE CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER FROM LA CARES. ABOUT WHAT THEIR FEELINGS ARE TOWARDS OUR STATE LAWS. IN THIS AREA. AND BELIEVE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO. DRIVE THAT LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY THAT'S NECESSARY SO WE CAN HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THESE CONTRACTS- APPRECIATE THE- DISCUSSION HERE TODAY AND I WILL THANK VERY MUCH THE PANEL ON ISSUE NINE AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO ISSUE TO. HE HAD. PANEL TEN IS ON THE OPIOID SETTLEMENTS FUND OVERSIGHT AND THE STATE DIRECTED PROGRAMS PCP WE WILL HAVE ONE PRESENTER G. C. COOPER STATE MEDICAID DIRECTOR AND CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS AT DH CS PLEASE BEGIN RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH AS THE DH CS IS REQUESTING ELEVEN POSITIONS AND EXPENDITURE THIRTY OF THIRTY THREE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS- OPIOID SETTLEMENT FUNDS- IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE TO SUPPORT THE OVERSIGHT OF A TWO OF CALIFORNIANS PROVISIONS OF THE NATIONAL OPIOID SETTLEMENT. I TO ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS IN THE AGENDA OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WILL STILL RETAIN- OVER FORTY MILLION OF THE OPIOID SETTLEMENT FUNDS TO CONDUCT A STATEWIDE MEDIA CAMPAIGN REGARDING FAT AND ALL WE JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT THE ONLY ITEM SHIFTING TO DH CS OF FROM PUBLIC HEALTH IS THE SHATTERPROOF ACTIVITIES OR WHAT'S CALLED ATLAS AS I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT SO AT THE REQUEST INCLUDES A SHIFT FROM PUBLIC HEALTH THE DCS FOR NINE POINT TWO MILLION ONE TIME FUNDS OVER THREE YEARS- THAT WERE INCLUDED AT THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE LAUNCH OF THE SHATTERPROOF ADDICTION TREATMENT LOCATOR ASSESSMENT AND STANDARDS. PLATFORM ALSO KNOWN AS ATLAS. THAT WAS INCLUDED IT ALSO COMES WITH AN OUTREACH CAMPAIGN THAT SPECIFICALLY TIED TO ATLAS WHICH IS WHY BOTH GET TOGETHER. OVER BEING TRANSFERRED TO D. H. C. S. D. H. C. S. RT HAD A CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP IN CONTRACT OF WITH SHATTERPROOF. WE HAD BEEN WORKING WITH THEM IN REGARDS TO OUR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PROGRAM AND HOW WE CAN GET BETTER INFORMATION OUT TO OUR MEDIC CAL. YOU KNOW A BENEFICIARIES IN REGARDS TO YOU- THE FACILITY LOCATION AND THE QUALITY OF THOSE FACILITIES AND SO THAT'S WHY WE ULTIMATELY MADE THE TRANSITION OVER TO ARE RECOMMENDING THE TRANSITION OVER TO DH CS. SO WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT PARTICULAR PIECE IN REGARDS TO HOW DH CS PLANS TO SUPPORT INNOVATION IN PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF SUBSTANCE USE. A USE ADDICTION AND OVERDOSE- YOU KNOW DH CS INTENDS TO REALLY CONTINUE INNOVATIVE APPROACHES US IN THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. IN REGARDS TO UTILIZATION OF THE OPIOID SETTLEMENT FUNDS. WE CALIFORNIA BROADLY HAS BEEN A LEADER IN REGARD TO SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES. WE WERE THE FIRST IN THE NATION AS YOU ALL KNOW IN REGARDS EVEN MOVING FORWARD WITH AN STD WAIVER WHICH GREATLY IS CONTINUING TO BUILD OUR CONTINUE- IN A ROBUST SYSTEM- WE HAVE BEEN A LEAD ON. A MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT EXPANSION ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CALIFORNIA BRIDGE PROGRAM WITH AN EMERGENCY ROOMS IN CONNECTING INDIVIDUALS TO THOSE SERVICES.

HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY YOU MAY. I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DÍAS FOR ANY QUESTIONS I WILL KEEP IT HERE AT THE CHAIR- VERY ENCOURAGED TO SEE THE SETTLEMENT FUNDS HELPING US TO ADDRESS THE OVERDOSE CRISIS TO- FOR ME TO SEE THAT WE ARE HAVING THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT OF OVERDOSES FROM WHEN I-WAS PRACTICING MEDICINE. IS DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT BASED ON THE VOLUME I SAW BACK THEN AND NO THERE'S MUCH MORE WE CAN DO WHAT I WANT TO FOCUS A LITTLE BIT ON THE PREVENTION SIDE IF I CAN- I DIDN'T HEAR. OF PROPOSAL THAT WILL HELP US TO ADDRESS PILFERING- A POWERFUL ON RAMPS WHERE CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS ARE GAINING ACCESS TO. WOOD MEDICATIONS BECAUSE THE PRESCRIPTION BOTTLES OR VIALS ARE NOT LOCKABLE. IS IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO USE OPIOIDS SETTLEMENT FUNDS ON SOMETHING SIMILAR TO- LOCKABLE PILL VIALS AS A MEANS TO PREVENTION- AND HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP IF WE CAN HAVE THAT CONVERSATION OFFLINE AS WELL SURE SO- IN BOTH OF THE SETTLEMENT THERE'S A CLEAR LIST OF THINGS THAT THE FUNDS CAN AND CAN'T BE USED FOR SO I WOULD NEED TO GO BACK AND CONSULT WITH THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON THAT WAS MADE TO SEE IF THAT FALLS WITHIN BOUNDARIES OF WHAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE. A SOMETHING FUNDS COULD BE USED TO WOULD HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT ONE IS THE AUTHOR OF A BILL FOR THE SECOND TWO YEAR NOW IN THIS SPACE WOULD LOVE TO FOLLOW UP AND FIGURE OUT IF WE CAN DIRECT RESOURCES- THANK YOU I WILL- THANK YOU VERY MUCH PANEL TEN WE WILL MOVE ON TO PANEL ELEVEN. WHICH IS OUR FINAL PANEL TODAY. AND AN SSUE TO BE HEARD TODAY IS GOING TO BE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY DATA SCIENCE AND IN FOR ME. INFORMATIK ONYX FRAMEWORK B. C. P. FROM CDPH.

THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT EMERGED FOCUSED ON THE INVESTMENTS NEEDED IN CORE DATA TECHNOLOGY IF. CAPABILITIES BOTH RECENT CHALLENGES AND FORWARD THINKING STRATEGIES TO PREPARE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ITS RESIDENTS FOR A HEALTHIER FUTURE. THE WORKER RECOGNIZE THAT IT WAS ESSENTIAL FOR PUBLIC HEALTH DATA pAND TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS TO SHIP FROM A CATEGORICAL IN CASE BASED APPROACH TO A FLEXIBLE EGO SOCIAL LIFE COURSE MODEL THAT EVENTS ACTUALLY IN EVERY COMPONENT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. THE GOAL FOR THE INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY AND ANALYTICS IS TO TRANSFORM PUBLIC HEALTH DATA SYSTEMS. BEING BASED ONLY AND RETROSPECTIVE DATA AND HEALTH PROMOTION TO PREDICTIVE PLANS AND ACTIONS INCLUDING COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT STRATEGIES THAT EMPHASIZE EQUITY. PREVENTION AND THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. ASSOCIATED CO BENEFITS OF THESE INVESTMENTS INCLUDE IMPROVED INFORMATION SYSTEMS THAT WILL INFORM EFFORTS BY THE HEALTH CARE AND MENTAL HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEMS AS WELL AS OTHER SOCIAL SERVICES AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WORKING IN PREVENTION AND EQUITY SUPPORTED THROUGH THIS PCP IN ENABLE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE AFOREMENTIONED GOALS INCOME BENEFITS BY FOCUSING ON PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT.

THE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INVESTMENT IN IT DATA SCIENCE AND INFORMATICS FORM THE BASIS FOR THE FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH B. C. P. AND ARE THE FOCUS FOR TODAY'S DISCUSSION. OR OUTCOME OF THIS IS THE P. TO SHIFT FROM THE CURRENT SILO PROGRAMMATIC SYSTEMS. THAT NEED TO COMMENCE OUR DECISIONS TO EXPANDED DATA ACCESS ENABLING ADVANCED PUBLIC HEALTH ANALYTICS FOR CDPH AND ITS PARTNERS. CHIAPA OUTPUTS AND OUTCOMES FOR THIS VCP INCLUDE A GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK FOR REVIEW AND PRIORITIZATION OF PUBLIC HEALTH DATA INITIATIVES. COMPREHENSIVE IT INVESTMENTS AND PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS SHARE DATA STANDARDS BASED IN INFORMATICS SCIENCE WITH AN ENTERPRISE LENDS THAT MOVES AWAY FROM SILETZ SOLUTIONS.

THANK YOU JOHN AS JOHN NOTED WELL CDPH DEMONSTRATED SUCCESS DELIVERING LARGE SCALE RAPIDLY DEPLOYED COMPLEX I. T. SOLUTIONS TO SUPPORT PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE TO THE CREDIT NINETEENTH ENDEMIC. INVESTMENTS ARE STILL NEEDED TO MODERNIZE SUSTAIN THIS TRANSFORMATION OF OUR IT AND DATA SITES WOULD SUPPORT INTEGRATIVE APPROACH USING THE FOLLOWING. AND PROCESS REPLANNING. REPLANNING PHASE CURRENTLY INCLUDES CONDUCTING SUSTAINABILITY ASIDE. POST CODE REVIEWS I T. NEED TRANSFORMATION SYSTEM CAPABILITY ANALYSES AND CLOUD MIGRATION TECHNICAL AND DATA MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES. PLANNING A PLANNING PHASE WILL PROVIDE THE OVERALL FOUNDATIONAL STRATEGY AND ROADMAP SUPPORTING OPERATING MODELS AND DATA AND IT GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES. A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE PLANNING PHASE IS WORKING WITH A CALIFORNIA CONFERENCE OF LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AND THE CALIFORNIA CONFERENCE OF LOCAL HEALTH DATA MANAGERS AND ACADEMIA ALLERGISTS IT WILL ALSO INCLUDE THE NEWLY ESTABLISHED REGIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICE. THESE STAKEHOLDERS WILL PROVIDE THE INPUT NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH IS INCLUDED IN CDPH IS UNDERSTANDING OF DATA AND TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS AT THE STATE LOCAL AND REGIONAL LEVELS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF PROCESSES. ADDITIONALLY IN MY ROLE AS THE CHIEF DATA OFFICER I KNEW GATES IN THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY DATA EXCHANGE FRAMEWORK DEVELOPMENT. ENSURING THAT ANY PUBLIC HEALTH DATA SCIENCE AND IT INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT IS IN ALIGNMENT WITH THIS KEY INITIATIVE. IMPLEMENTATION IN THIS PHASE WILL BE SPLIT INTO TWO KEY PARTS. FIRST THERE ARE NEAR TERM OFFERS THESE INCLUDE SHOVEL READY STATE AND LOCAL PROJECTS ANY ALTERNATIVES AND LOOK HOW NO CODE PLATFORM SERVICES. FOLLOWING THE SUBURBS WILL BE NEEDS A LONGER TERM INVESTMENTS THIS INCLUDES THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF TECHNOLOGY ECOSYSTEMS AND BRING MARKS. APPLICATION SERVICES CONSOLIDATION AND ENTERPRISE PORTFOLIO AND DATA GOVERNANCE AGAIN THE SPACE WILL BE DONE IN LOCKSTEP AND INPUT WITH. ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT WITH UCLA JOE SHE ACT CCL. IT'S DM ME AND THE OUR FUTURE. THE PLANNING AND AFTER AND ANY PROPOSED THIS PIECE. OR ALLOWS. TO CONTINUE TO BUILD ON ITS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SUCCESSES AND OF ALL DATA SCIENCE INFORMED DECISION MAKING. LASTLY WE WILL LOOK INTO A CONTINUOUS MATURITY AND PROGRAM VALUE DELIVERY IS ONGOING FEES INCLUDE SYSTEM STABILIZATION IN TWO YEARS PLANNING EFFORTS TO ENSURE FUTURE BUSINESS NEEDS AND SERVICES ARE BEING MET. AND OF COURSE MONITORING AND UPDATING KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND METRICS THIS MEANS WILL INFORM FUTURE NEEDS OF PUBLIC HEALTH AT ALL LEVELS. IS YOU'VE HEARD TODAY THE INVESTMENTS REQUESTED IN THIS B. C. P. AND THE PATH TOWARDS IMPLEMENTATION OF A MAJOR TRANSFORMATION OUR PUBLIC HEALTH DATA AND I. T. SYSTEMS. WILL PROVIDE AN UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY TO LEVERAGE THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE COCA NINETEEN RESPONSE THIS WILL TRANSLATE THE BCP FUNDED PLANS INTO MEANINGFUL ACTIONS WHICH WILL BENEFIT LOCAL HUNG JURISDICTIONS. PUBLIC HEALTH STAKEHOLDERS CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES AND ULTIMATELY. ALL CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR SOME PADDOCK WITH THE L. L. THANK YOU- DOCTOR AND BILL- AND AFTERWARD- SEND YOU PICK FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'M- YOU MAY RECALL THAT WHEN WE ASSESS THE ADMINISTRATION'S JANUARY FUTURE OF PUBLIC HEALTH PROPOSAL WE NOTED THAT IT LACKED AN OVER ARCHING A KEY STRATEGY. AND THIS PROPOSAL DOES- FILL THAT GAP- WE ALSO KNOW THE PROPOSAL DOES LOOK PROMISING IT FOCUSES ON CREATING SORT OF A COMPREHENSIVE DATA AND INFORMATICS ECOSYSTEM FOR PUBLIC HEALTH COMPLETE WITH LEADERSHIP TO STRIP TO THINK STRATEGICALLY ABOUT DATA AND I. T. NEEDS AND USES- WE WOULD LIKE TO OFFER A FEW SUGGESTIONS FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION- I HAVE A FEW THAT ARE. SORT OF HIGH LEVEL AND THEN WE HAVE A FEW THAT ARE- SORT OF SPECIFIC TO THE COMPONENTS OF THE OF THE B. C. P. THE HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS PRIMARILY CONCERNED LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT TO HELP ENSURE THAT THIS MODERNIZATION OF DATA AND I. T. SYSTEMS IS SUCCESSFUL. SO FIRST I WOULD SUGGEST REPORTING- IN OUR SYSTEM AND OF THE FUTURE OF PUBLIC PUBLIC HEALTH PROPOSAL WE HAD SEVERAL- SUGGESTED LAYERS OF REPORTING TO THE LEGISLATURE FROM. SORT OF IMPLEMENTATION UPDATES TO MORE- FORMAL ANNUAL REPORTS- AS WELL AS A MULTI YEAR REVIEWS. AND WOULD SUGGEST THAT- ANY. IT UPDATES ON IT SYSTEMS BEFORE THAT INTO THAT REPORTING FUTURE PROPOSALS FUTURITY PROPOSALS IN IN PUBLIC HEALTH SO WHEN THE DEPARTMENT- MAKES FUTURE PROPOSALS WE SUGGEST THE LEGISLATURE ASK KEY QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THE PROPOSED I. T. SYSTEMS FITS INTO THIS LARGER- IT INFRASTRUCTURE AND ABOUT FUNDING- AS YOU WELL KNOW THE CDPH PROGRAMS AND I. T. SYSTEMS HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN CHALLENGED BY THE CATEGORICAL NATURE OF PUBLIC HEALTH GRANT FUNDING. AND MOST I. T. SYSTEMS HAVE CONSEQUENTLY BEEN DEVELOPED SORT OF IN SILOS- LOOKING AHEAD EVEN WHEN GRANT FUNDING CAN ONLY BE USED FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT CDPH CAN'T CONSIDER THE PROJECT WITH IN THIS OVERALL INFRASTRUCTURE. AND DEVELOP IT TO MAINTAIN CONSISTENCY SO FOR EXAMPLE MAKE SURE THAT DATA IS COLLECTED IN A WAY THAT CAN BE USED ACROSS SYSTEMS- AND ALSO MAKE SURE THAT ANY NEW SYSTEMS ARE INTEROPERABLE WITH OTHER- PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEMS. SO WE SUGGEST THAT THOUGH THE LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO ASK ABOUT THESE TYPES OF ISSUES EACH TIME A NEW PROPOSALS PUT FORWARD. I'M A THIRD POINT- CONCERNS LOCAL INVOLVEMENT- THE B. C. P. NOTES THAT PLANNING AND DESIGN INCLUDES CONSIDERATION OF HOW THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH JURISDICTIONS WILL USE DATA AND I. T. SYSTEMS. AND IN ADDITION- MS MOORE NOTED THAT- THAT CITY PH WILL BE WORKING WITH LOCAL- HEALTH JURISDICTIONS IN THE PLANNING. PROCESS THIS IS OBVIOUSLY VERY KEY AS THE STATE SYSTEMS DEPEND ON. THE LOCAL SYSTEMS AND TE LOCAL INPUTS- WORKING IN TANDEM- WHAT ONE THING THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER IS WHETHER CDPH SHOULD REQUIRE THE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS TO INCLUDE. SORT OF AN IT COMPONENT IN THE PLANS THAT SO THE LOCL PUBLIC CULTURE SECTIONS HAVE TO SUBMIT A PLAN- AS A CONDITION OF RECEIVING FUNDING AS PART OF THE FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL- SO THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER- REQUIRING CDPH TO. REQUIRE THAT THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS- MAYBE ADDRESS THE STATUS OR WEAKNESSES OF THEIR OWN A. T. SYSTEMS AND HOW THOSE MIGHT BE ADDRESSED- AND THEN. FINALLY ON THESE HIGHER LEVEL COMMENTS WE ADDRESS RECOMMENDED- WITH THE FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH PROPOSAL THAT THAT PROPOSAL B. CODIFIED INTO STATUTE VIA TRAILER BILL AND WE RECOMMEND THAT THIS PROPOSAL BE INCLUDED WITH THAT. CURRENTLY EVERYTHING'S IN PROVISIONAL BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE- SO A FEW A FEW COMMENTS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL ITSELF WHICH REALLY STARTS THE PROCESS OF MODERNIZING THE STATE'S PUBLIC HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE. I'M FIRST OUR FIRST COMIC CONCERNS PLANNING SO THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO AUGMENT- IT'S ONE TIME RESOURCES ONCE. ENTERPRISE PLANNING AND STRATEGY DOCUMENTS ARE SUBMITTED TO AND APPROVED BY CAL HHS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY- THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER WHETHER THE PROPOSED- A BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE MIGHT BE AMENDED SO THAT THOSE DOCUMENTS ARE PROVIDED TO THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL- A REVIEW OF THESE DOCUMENTS WILL BE CRITICAL FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE FREE MARKET VISION IN THE PROPOSAL. WILL ACTUALLY BE IMPLEMENTED. AND PART OF THAT REVIEW SHOULD FOCUS ON WHICH I. T. PROJECTS AND EFFORTS ARE MOST CRITICAL TO MODERNIZING THE STATE'S PUBLIC HEALTH IT INFRASTRUCTURE SO FOR EXAMPLE SOME OF THE STATE'S- PUBLIC HEALTH IT SYSTEMS LIKE THE VITAL RECORD SYSTEMS- MUST REMAIN FUNCTIONAL. EVEN WHILE THEY'RE BEING MODERNIZED- OTHER SYSTEMS HAVE A NUMBER OF INTERFACES WITH EXTERNAL ENTITIES AND INTERNAL SMALLER SYSTEMS SUCH AS THE ONES AT THE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTION LEVEL OR- WITH OTHER HEALTH SYSTEM. CARE SYSTEMS- AND THESE THAT NEED YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO MAINTAIN INTER OPERABILITY- THE ENTERPRISE PLANNING AND STRATEGY DOCUMENT SHOULD PROVIDE NOT ONLY THE LEVEL OF EFFORT REQUIRED TO COMPLETE- THE IT PROJECTS BUT ALSO CLEARLY IDENTIFY WHICH EFFORTS AND PROJECTS ARE MOST CRITICAL. AND FOR WHICH ANY POTENTIAL RISKS NEED TO BE MITIGATED. I'M OUR SECOND N. AND LAST COMMENT IS THAT- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PROPOSES IN THE PROVISIONAL BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE TO CONSIDER. A VERIFIED IT SATISFACTORY PROGRESS TOWARD COMPLETION OF PLANNING IN THE PROPOSAL- THE LEGISLATURE COULD ASK HOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WILL MEASURE THIS PROGRESS- AND WHETHER MORE OBJECTIVE MEASURES OF PROGRESS SUCH AS THE COMPLETION OF CERTAIN DOCUMENTS. MEETING CERTAIN MILESTONES- SHOULD BE INCLUDED- AND THIS OBVIOUSLY COULD INVOLVE NOTIFICATION OF THE LEGISLATURE- WE JUST CLOSE BY NOTING THAT THE FREE MARKET GOALS AND VISION OF THIS PROPOSAL HAVE MERIT. BUT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONTINUE TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT AND EVALUATE THE DEPARTMENT'S PROGRESS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COMPONENTS OF THE FREE MARKET GOALS AND VISION. ARE MET INCLUDING ANY ADDITIONAL- ITEMS THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO ADD TO THE PROPOSAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DIESS I WILL BEGIN- WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THE DEPARTMENT RESPOND IF WE CAN ON HOW WE ARE GOING TO BOTH MEASURE. PROGRESS AS WELL AS HOW MANY OF THESE WILL FIT INTO THE LARGER IT SYSTEMS HOPING YOU CAN COMMENT ON. THOSE CONCERNS REYES FROM THE L. L. YES THEY CAN'T SO BCPS EVERYBODY PUTTING IN AND THE METRICS WILL BE FORMULATED AROUND AS WE GET THE STRATEGIES OF THE SPENDING PLAN FOR THE PUBLIC PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT FOCUSES ON STAFF AND CAPACITY FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE COMMUNICATIONS COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS AND LOCAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH FUNDING IT'S NOT THAT THE SPENDING PLAN ALLOCATED. LIMITED FUNDING UP FIFTY K. FOR THREE POSITIONS THE BAND CALIFORNIA BIRTH AND DEFECTS MODERATE PROGRAM. RESOURCES WERE ALSO INCLUDED FOR THE MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS ESTABLISHED DURING THE CURRENT FUNDING PANDEMIC. THIS FUNDING SUPPORTS THE TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE IN PROGRAM SUPPORT FOR DISEASE SURVEILLANCE READINESS RESPONSIVENESS RECOVERY AND COMMUNITY OF OPPORTUNITIES CONTINUE ALREADY OPERATIONS. THE FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH FUNDING BUILT ON THE FOUNDATION FOR DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION THAT ENABLES A MODERNIZATION OF CDPH INFRASTRUCTURE INFORMATICS CAPABILITIES THE COR UP AND IN THE FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH BCPS TO SHIFT FROM SILENT PROGRAMMATIC SOLUTIONS. LIKE MENTIONED ON TO PROGRAMMATIC SYSTEMS THAT LEAD THAT LEADS THAT COMMUNICATION DECISIONS TO EXPAND DATA ACCESS ENABLING ADVANCED PUBLIC HEALTH ANALYTICS FOR CDPH PARTNERS. I'M GOING OUT ON IF I CAN EARLIER YOU INDICATED THAT WE- HAVE AN UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY BEFORE US AND I'M ALWAYS IN THOSE MOMENTS TRYING TO MAKE SURE THERE WERE MAXIMIZING THOSE OPPORTUNITIES THAT I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND. BAND WITH AND RESOURCES AS WELL- EARLIER WE HAD- IN THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY TEN BUDGET HE PROPOSES THREE HUNDRED MILLION TWO HUNDRED MILLION TO GO TO LOCAL HEALTH AND HUNDRED FIRST THE STATE- IS THERE OPPORTUNITY WITHIN THAT SOURCE OF FUNDING TO COMBINE AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MAXIMIZING THOSE UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU PRODUCT. YOUR MANY ANSWER FOR SURE YOU CAN START LOS UP SURE SO THE FUNDING ON THE BC IS THAT WERE UP FOR THE MAINTENANCE OPERATION. CLICK OR- TO KEEP THEM. IN CONTINUATION. BERKOWITZ WE ESTABLISHED THIS NEW FUNDING IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO THE STRATEGY AND PLANNING CORRECTLY TO BE ABLE TO EXECUTE ON THE FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH ITSELF. YEAH I'M FROM A PROGRAM PERSPECTIVE. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT FUNDS THAT WILL GO TO THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. UNLIKE CATEGORICAL FUNDING WHERE WERE FOCUSING ON ONE CONDITION AT A TIME. THIS FUNDING ALLOWS MORE OF AN UMBRELLA APPROACH WHERE WE CAN REALLY. COME AT IT FROM THE BEGINNING EVEN THOUGH OUR SYSTEMS ARE ALREADY IN PLACE AND ARE SOME SYSTEMS THAT MAY HAVE TO OPERATE OUTSIDE OF THE ECOSYSTEM. AS MENTIONED EARLIER. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY BRING THE RIGHTS. STAKEHOLDERS TO THE TABLE AND TAKE THE TIME TO DO IT. AND GET THE INPUT WE NEED IN A MORE COORDINATED FASHION. SO EVEN THOUGH THERE'S FUNDS THAT ARE GOING TO THE LOCALS AS WELL AS TO THE STATE. IT'S NOT CATEGORICAL IT'S BROAD INTENTION WILL PROVIDE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO NOT ONLY OPTIMIZE BUT MAXIMIZE. OUR OUR RESOURCES TO THE I. T. AND THE INFORMATICS AND DATA SCIENCE INFRASTRUCTURE. I WILL ASK TO FOLLOW UP WITH MY OFFICE IF POSSIBLE I AM QUITE INTERESTED IN INFO MATIX AND BELIEVE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US. TO TRANSFORM OUR PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM. AND BELIEVE THAT POPULATION HEALTH IN THE INFORMATION AND DATA AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE MAKING THE RIGHT DECISIONS ARE REALLY PREDICATED ON THE SYSTEMS THAT WE CREATE AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO- COMMUNICATING AND WORKING WITH YOUR DEPARTMENTS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT WORKS FOR CALIFORNIA. WITH ABSOLUTELY IT. WITH THAT I WILL THANKS VERY MUCH- THIS PANEL AND WE WILL AND WILL THANK ALL OF OUR PANELISTS HERE TODAY IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL MEMBERS COMMENTS WE WILL NOW BEGIN PUBLIC COMMENT WE DO HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT AND THEREFORE I WANT TO URGE YOU TO KEEP YOUR COMMENTS BRIEF SO THAT WE CAN HEAR FROM EVERYONE. BLIK COMMENT IS WELCOME ON ANY ISSUE WHICH IS ON THE AGENDA. INCLUDING ON THE NON PRESENTATION ISSUES. WE WILL START WITH ANY IN PERSON PUBLIC COMMENTS IN THE HEARING ROOM IF YOU CAN PLEASE COME FORWARD TO THE MICROPHONE TO MAKE YOUR COME REPRESENTING FORMAT AND REGARDING THE OUTCOME OF YOUR OFFICES HEALTHCARE AFFORDABILITY. WE PROVIDED SUGGESTED LANGUAGE TO THE MYSTERIES OF THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DATA TO BE COLLECTED WILL REFLECT THE NET COST TO THE PAYER FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. AND IN ADDITION WE WANT TO BE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT POLICY MAKERS GOING FORWARD WILL HAVE CORRECT INFORMATION ON CAR SHARING OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES IMPOSED ON PATIENTS. BY THIRD PARTY PAYERS WE APPRECIATE THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION IN PARTICULAR DR WOODS OFFICE. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I FEEL LIKE SUIT WITH MANIFEST MEDICS ARE PROUD TO BE ONE OF CALIFORNIA IS. A NONPROFIT HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGES OR H. ID FOR SHORT. SO I'M SPEAKING AS A MEMBER OF THE CYCLICAL MISSION THAT DOCTOR WOULD GRACIOUSLY AND MENTIONED IN HIS REMARKS THE MEDIC HOW-DATA SHARING EQUITY CO A COALITION. OF MY COMMENTS ON BOTH THE ISSUE SEVEN ON MEDICAID ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS ON WHICH THERE WAS A ROBUST DISCUSSION. AS WELL AS- SSUES EIGHTEEN WHICH WASN'T PRESENTED BUT IS NO LESS IMPORTANT ON INTER OPERABILITY. NOT WHILE THESE TWO BCPS ARE ARE NECESSARY RESOURCES FOR DH CS TO ENACT A CENTRAL. DATA SHARING FOR CALLIN THE AREN'T SUFFICIENT- THE NEEDS TO BE FUNDING FOR BOTH DIRECT INCENTIVES FOR PROVIDERS TO SHARE GOOD QUALITY CLINICAL DATA NOT JUST CLAIMS DATA FROM HEALTH PLANS. AND INVESTMENT H. I. EASE INFRASTRUCTURE TRACTION BURKE THIS DATA INTO INSIGHTS AND INTO ACTION. AND FOR A SECOND PIECE AS WE DISCUSSED THERE IS AS HIGH AS A NINETY ONE FEDERAL MATCH FOR- THOSE RESOURCES. SO PLEASE WE ASK. THAT YOU JOIN OUR pELOQUENT CASE FOR BEING MUCH BOLDER AND FORWARD LOOKING AND LONG TERM- AND WE ASK THE ASSEMBLY AND ENTIRE LEGISLATURE TO ADOPT ARE NINETY FIVE MILLION. ADDITIONAL EQUITY PACKAGE INVESTORS STATE BUDGET THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SEEING NO MORE PUBLIC COMMENT IN THE ROOM I WILL ASK FOR THE OPERATOR IF WE CAN GO.

WE WILL GO TO LINE NINE YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF THE POLITICAL OR NON GAP OF ALIGNMENT HEALTH PLAN WHICH REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY NINETY THOUSAND SENIOR CITIZENS IN CALIFORNIA. I'M COMMENTING TODAY ON ISSUE NUMBER SIX AND WHILE WE DO SUPPORT THE BRIDE CARE COORDINATION INTEGRATION CALLED THE COW IN WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROPOSED INTENDING TO DO WELL DOUBLE FACIAL NEEDS PLANNED- EQUIPMENT IT LINED ENROLLMENT TRANSITION HAPPENING IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE- THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE.

WELL THE PROPOSAL WOULD INVEST IN MANY LAUDABLE EFFORTS IT ALSO UNFORTUNATELY CONTAINS UP TO LAW THAT WOULD MOVE CALIFORNIA BACKWARDS IN ITS.

UNTIL NECESSARY BENCHMARKS HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED IN ORDER TO ENSURE A CAREFUL AND JUDICIOUS TRANSITION OF THE HONORABLE POPULATION. AS WE HAVE SEEN IN PREVIOUS TRANSITIONS INVOLVING SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. THE PATIENT PROVIDER RELATIONSHIP IS AN IMPORTANT ONE AND SOMETIMES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH FOR A PATIENT.

HOWEVER DH CS IS ALREADY JUGGLING MANY COMPETING INITIATIVES AND PRIORITIES THAT MAY POSE A THREAT TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROGRAMMATIC DETAILS OF A TRANSITION OF THIS SIZE AND SCOPE.

AS WE SAW DURING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COORDINATED CARE NASH THAT THE CCI IN TWENTY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN. THE LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT AND INVOLVEMENT OF PHYSICIANS WITH MINIMAL. AS A RESULT THE RETURNS OF THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS THAT DESCEND ROLLED FROM TCI BECAUSE THEIR PROVIDER WAS NOT ENROLLED. WITH THE MEDIC HOW MANAGED CARE PLANS. BETTER THAN.
