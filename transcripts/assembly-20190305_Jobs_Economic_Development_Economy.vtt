00:30:40.104 --> 00:30:42.607
I WAS BORN IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA --

00:30:42.674 --> 00:30:44.642

FAMILY STILL HAS THAT FORM THERE.

00:30:46.177 --> 00:30:47.145
AND I HAVE THE PART OF THE

00:30:47.212 --> 00:30:48.746
REASON THAT I WAS ENTHUSIASTIC

00:30:48.813 --> 00:30:50.148
ABOUT TAKING THIS JOB.

00:30:50.215 --> 00:30:51.249
IS TO HELP ENSURE THAT THE

00:30:51.316 --> 00:30:52.483
CALIFORNIA ECONOMY WORKS FOR

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:53.751
EVERYONE.

00:30:53.818 --> 00:30:55.086
AND NOT JUST THOSE WHO HAPPEN TO

00:30:55.153 --> 00:30:57.555
BE IN PLACE --

00:30:57.622 --> 00:30:59.624
BENEFIT FROM THEIR HEAD TAIL

00:30:59.691 --> 00:31:00.959
WINDS THAT ARE MOVING THE

00:31:01.025 --> 00:31:02.260
ECONOMY FORWARD AND THAT'S A

00:31:02.327 --> 00:31:04.028
LARGE PART OF WHAT I TEACH AT

00:31:04.095 --> 00:31:05.330
STANFORD BUSINESS SCHOOL IS

00:31:05.396 --> 00:31:06.864
THINKING ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES

00:31:06.931 --> 00:31:07.966
TO BUILD A MORE INCLUSIVE

00:31:08.032 --> 00:31:10.134
ECONOMY IN WAYS THAT WORK FOR

00:31:10.201 --> 00:31:10.668
BUSINESS AND WORK FOR THE

00:31:10.735 --> 00:31:11.903
ECONOMY.

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:13.404
SO I'M EXCITED TO TAK THIS

00:31:13.471 --> 00:31:15.540
OPPORTUNITY.

00:31:15.607 --> 00:31:16.608
AND THERE IS.

00:31:16.674 --> 00:31:19.010
A REAL OPPORTUNITY I BELIEVE TO

00:31:19.077 --> 00:31:20.845
ENSURE THAT THE CALIFORNIA

00:31:20.912 --> 00:31:22.547
ECONOMY ACTUALLY HAS SUSTAINABLE

00:31:22.614 --> 00:31:24.649
ECONOMIC GROWTH.

00:31:24.716 --> 00:31:27.418
THAT WORKS FOR ALL CITIZENS.

00:31:27.485 --> 00:31:29.721
ENSURING THAT IT IS AN ECONOMY

00:31:29.787 --> 00:31:32.323
THAT IS BOTH RESILIENT THROUGH

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:33.992
THIS ECONOMIC CYCLES.

00:31:34.058 --> 00:31:37.295
THAT IS ONE WHICH CREATES JOBS.

00:31:37.362 --> 00:31:38.630
NOT JUST IN THE PART OF THE

00:31:38.696 --> 00:31:40.298
ECONOMY AND IN THIS PARTY

00:31:40.365 --> 00:31:42.433
ECONOMIC CYCLE THAT IS AT THE

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.135
TOP OF THE CYCLE. ONE THAT

00:31:44.202 --> 00:31:46.671
INSURERS THAT WE ARE DOING THAT

00:31:46.738 --> 00:31:48.973
IN WAYS WHICH IS GOOD FOR THE

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.441
ENVIRONMENT.

00:31:50.508 --> 00:31:51.676
AND ONE THAT HELPS CREATE HIGH

00:31:51.743 --> 00:31:54.012
QUALITY JOBS FOR CITIZENS AND SO

00:31:54.078 --> 00:31:56.714
I THINK ABOUT MY ROLE AS THE

00:31:56.781 --> 00:31:57.915
CHIEF ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS

00:31:57.982 --> 00:31:59.617
ADVISER THE GOVERNOR AS WELL AS

00:31:59.684 --> 00:32:02.320
THE ROLE IN THE GOVERNMENT'S

00:32:02.387 --> 00:32:03.888
OFFICE OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.

00:32:03.955 --> 00:32:05.390
TO ENSURE THAT THAT HAPPENS

00:32:05.456 --> 00:32:06.624
TRYING TO HELP MAKE THAT HAPPEN

00:32:06.691 --> 00:32:07.725
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT OF

00:32:07.792 --> 00:32:09.060
THINGS THAT ARE BEYOND OUR

00:32:09.127 --> 00:32:09.794
CONTROL AND THINGS ARE NOT

00:32:09.861 --> 00:32:10.662
WITHIN.

00:32:10.728 --> 00:32:12.196
THE PURVIEW OF WHAT THAT

00:32:12.263 --> 00:32:15.733
SPECIFIC THAT'S WHAT I'M WHERE

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:18.002
I'M COMING FROM.

00:32:18.069 --> 00:32:20.405
I DID A WEAPON ARE HOT WITH --

00:32:20.471 --> 00:32:22.240
CALIFORNIA ECONOMIC SUMMIT THAT

00:32:22.307 --> 00:32:23.241
PRESENTED A LOT OF THE DETAIL

00:32:23.308 --> 00:32:24.909
AND CERTAINLY IF ANYONE WOULD

00:32:24.976 --> 00:32:26.577
LIKE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THAT IT'S

00:32:26.644 --> 00:32:28.413
ON THE WEBSITE.

00:32:28.479 --> 00:32:30.381
ON OUR WEBSITE --

00:32:30.448 --> 00:32:31.849
LET ME TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT.

00:32:31.916 --> 00:32:32.984
FIVE THINGS THAT ARE THINK ARE

00:32:33.051 --> 00:32:34.252
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THESE

00:32:34.319 --> 00:32:36.387
OPPORTUNITIES.

00:32:36.454 --> 00:32:37.822
THE FIRST ONE IS THAT.

00:32:37.889 --> 00:32:39.624
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE

00:32:39.691 --> 00:32:41.526
ARE HINKING ABOUT HOW REGION'S

00:32:41.592 --> 00:32:42.627
RISE TOGETHER.

00:32:42.694 --> 00:32:45.096
AB THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

00:32:45.163 --> 00:32:46.097
HELP ENSURE THE ECONOMY WORKS

00:32:46.164 --> 00:32:47.865
BUT IT'S DIFFERENT CONTEXTS AND

00:32:47.932 --> 00:32:48.633
WHAT PART OF THE STATE WE'RE

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.134
TALKING ABOUT AND SO THE WAY I

00:32:50.201 --> 00:32:51.502
THINK ABOUT THAT IS NOT THAT WE

00:32:51.569 --> 00:32:54.105
NEED ONE TOP DOWN STATE APPROACH.

00:32:54.172 --> 00:32:55.139
BUT THE WE NEED TO HELP INSURE

00:32:55.206 --> 00:32:56.641
THAT WHAT'S NECESSARY FOR

00:32:56.708 --> 00:32:58.443
ECONOMIC SUCCESS IN THE INLAND

00:32:58.509 --> 00:33:00.278
EMPIRE IN THE CENTRAL PART OF

00:33:00.345 --> 00:33:03.047
THE STATE IN THE THE FAR EAST

00:33:03.114 --> 00:33:05.483
AND THE FAR NORTH OR DRIVEN BY

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:07.051
WHAT THOSE REGIONS BELIEVE IS

00:33:07.118 --> 00:33:08.753
IMPORTANT AND THAT THE STATE'S

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:09.520
ROLE WAS TO HELP AND HAVE.

00:33:09.587 --> 00:33:11.122
ENABLE THEIR SUCCESS SO IT'S

00:33:11.189 --> 00:33:12.957
ABOUT REGION'S RISING AND RISING

00:33:13.024 --> 00:33:14.992
BOTH FOR WHAT THEY NEED AND WELL

00:33:15.059 --> 00:33:16.127
AS CONNECTING THEM SO THAT THERE

00:33:16.194 --> 00:33:17.795
ARE COMPLEMENTARY CAPABILITIES

00:33:17.862 --> 00:33:20.798
OF DIFFERENT REGIONS THAT THEY

00:33:20.865 --> 00:33:21.399
CAN WORK TOGETHER.

00:33:21.466 --> 00:33:22.433
THE SECOND THING IS THAT THERE

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.302
IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF THIS

00:33:24.369 --> 00:33:25.770
WHICH IS REALLY ABOUT ENSURING

00:33:25.837 --> 00:33:27.138
THAT THE HEARTLAND OF THE

00:33:27.205 --> 00:33:28.406
STATE'S SUCCEEDS.

00:33:28.473 --> 00:33:29.807
AND BY THAT I MEAN THE PARTS OF

00:33:29.874 --> 00:33:31.476
THE STATE THAT HAVE HAD LESS

00:33:31.542 --> 00:33:32.343
ATTENTION.

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:35.213
FROM POLICY HISTORICALLY FROM

00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:38.049
THE MEDIA AND LESS FRANKLY FOCUS

00:33:38.116 --> 00:33:39.617
ON HOW WE SUPPORT WHAT'S

00:33:39.684 --> 00:33:41.285
NECESSARY FOR SUCCESS IN THE

00:33:41.352 --> 00:33:43.154
HEARTLAND OF THE STATE.

00:33:43.221 --> 00:33:44.355
THAT'S NOT AT THE THAT THAT THAT

00:33:44.422 --> 00:33:46.290
NOT LOOKING UP OF THE COAST BUT

00:33:46.357 --> 00:33:47.925
REALLY ENSURING THAT THERE IS A

00:33:47.992 --> 00:33:48.893
FOCUS.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.329
ON CENTRA CALIFORNIA THE INLAND

00:33:51.396 --> 00:33:53.264
EMPIRE AND PARTS WHERE THAT THE

00:33:53.331 --> 00:33:54.999
EFFORT CAN HELP ENSURE THAT THAT

00:33:55.066 --> 00:33:56.634
WHAT'S NECESSARY THERE TO

00:33:56.701 --> 00:33:58.035
SUCCEED WE SUPPORT.

00:33:58.102 --> 00:33:59.604
THE THIRD THING THAT I THINK IS

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:00.471
REALLY IMPORTANT AND YOU SAW

00:34:00.538 --> 00:34:02.140

00:34:04.809 --> 00:34:06.577
CONNECTED ECONOMY.

00:34:06.644 --> 00:34:07.945
WE NEED TO ENSURE.

00:34:08.012 --> 00:34:10.148

00:34:10.214 --> 00:34:12.083
THAT ARE AT FRONT AND CENTER FOR

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:13.484
MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES AND THE

00:34:13.551 --> 00:34:15.086
STATE HAVE REAL ATTENTION.

00:34:15.153 --> 00:34:16.354

IN MY ROLE AS IN THE SURE THAT

WE HAVE [inaudible]

00:34:48.186 --> 00:34:51.456
REAL FOR APPROACH TO HAVE

00:34:51.522 --> 00:34:53.024
CALIFORNIA FACE THE EXTERNAL

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:54.659

FROM YOUR CONSTITUENTS.

00:34:57.995 --> 00:35:00.364
THAT CONCERNS ABOUT.

00:35:00.431 --> 00:35:02.500
CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO EXPORT

00:35:02.567 --> 00:35:04.235
IS HURTING OUR JOB CREATION SO

00:35:04.302 --> 00:35:05.503
TRYING TO HELP ENSURE THAT WE'VE

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:08.372
GOT A FOCUS ON INTERNATIONAL.

00:35:08.439 --> 00:35:09.407
THE FOURTH THING I'D LIKE TO SAY

IS THAT --

00:35:10.808 --> 00:35:12.009

AND WE HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF

00:35:24.555 --> 00:35:25.990
PEOPLE ARE REALLY TRYING TO

00:35:26.057 --> 00:35:27.425

SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS.

00:35:35.466 --> 00:35:37.001
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FROM A FROM

00:35:37.068 --> 00:35:38.236
THE ECONOMY STANDPOINTS

00:35:38.302 --> 00:35:39.537
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WHEN I'M

00:35:39.604 --> 00:35:40.571
TALKING TO BUSINESS LEADERS

00:35:40.638 --> 00:35:42.306
ACROSS THE STATE THAT'S ONE OF

00:35:42.373 --> 00:35:43.908
THE FIRST THINGS THEY SAY TO ME.

00:35:43.975 --> 00:35:44.809

THE STATE AND FOR THINGS THAT

00:35:58.823 --> 00:36:00.525
ARE HIGH PRIORITIES.

00:36:00.591 --> 00:36:01.859

HELP ALIGN THOSE AROUND ENSURING

00:36:28.753 --> 00:36:30.288

JOB CREATION.

00:36:31.622 --> 00:36:32.823
AND JOB CREATION THAT HELPS WITH

OF ALL OF THIS IS IN THE CONTEXT

00:36:44.735 --> 00:36:47.505
OF WHAT I THINK OF AS TO WHAT IS

00:36:47.572 --> 00:36:49.073
BOTH SMART POLICY.

THE STATE IN THE FIRST PLACE I

00:37:33.517 --> 00:37:33.684
WOULD.

00:37:33.751 --> 00:37:36.387
I WAS BORN HERE BUT MY PARENTS

00:37:36.454 --> 00:37:37.154
WERE MIGRANTS.

00:37:37.221 --> 00:37:38.522
SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING

00:37:38.589 --> 00:37:38.889
WITH YOU ALL --

TAKE PERSPECTIVES ON WHAT THE

00:37:42.293 --> 00:37:44.729
WHAT YOU.

00:37:44.795 --> 00:37:45.363
WOULD LIKE TO AND APPRECIATE THE

00:37:45.429 --> 00:37:46.931
TIME.

00:37:46.998 --> 00:37:48.432
THANK YOU SO MUCH I WOULD LIKE

00:37:48.499 --> 00:37:49.934
TO OPEN IT UP TO COMMITTEE

00:37:50.001 --> 00:37:50.768
MEMBERS.

00:37:50.835 --> 00:37:52.003
IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS AT

00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:54.505
THIS MOMENT.

00:37:54.572 --> 00:37:56.440
MR ALMOST JUST --

00:37:56.507 --> 00:37:57.642
ONE CHAIR WHEN YOU SAY REGIS AND

00:37:57.708 --> 00:37:58.843
AND RISING TOGETHER BUT THEIR

00:37:58.909 --> 00:38:00.311
SPECIFIC NEEDS IN EACH ONE OF

00:38:00.378 --> 00:38:01.679
THOSE REGIONS THAT NEEDS TO BE

00:38:01.746 --> 00:38:03.047
IDENTIFIED.

00:38:03.114 --> 00:38:03.981
AND YOU TALK ABOUT THE INLAND

00:38:04.048 --> 00:38:06.584
EMPIRE IN THOSE AREAS SO CAN YOU

00:38:06.651 --> 00:38:07.785
ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE AND

00:38:07.852 --> 00:38:08.619
SOME OF THOSE ARE.

00:38:08.686 --> 00:38:10.888
SURE SO --

00:38:10.955 --> 00:38:15.126
THE BUT IF WE WERE SET UP IS

00:38:15.192 --> 00:38:16.193
SEPARATE STATES WITHIN AN

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:17.728
ECONOMY WE HAVE THE RICHEST

00:38:17.795 --> 00:38:18.996
STATE IN THE COUNTRY AND SILICON

00:38:19.063 --> 00:38:21.065
VALLEY AND WE HAVE THE POOREST

00:38:21.132 --> 00:38:22.433
STATE IN THE COUNTRY IN THE

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.301
CENTER PART OF THE STATE FROM

00:38:24.368 --> 00:38:25.136
CENTRAL VALLEY TO THE INLAND

00:38:25.202 --> 00:38:26.003
EMPIRE.

00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:29.874
AND THAT'S EVEN FOR THE COST OF

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:31.842
DEFINITELY WOULD HAVE A WIDE

00:38:31.909 --> 00:38:33.611
DISPERSION OF INCOME AND SO WHAT

00:38:33.678 --> 00:38:34.745
WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT IS

00:38:34.812 --> 00:38:36.514
THE CENTER PART OF THE STATE.

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:37.982
SO CENTRAL CALIFORNIA THE INLAND

00:38:38.049 --> 00:38:39.750
EMPIRE AS A FIRST PRIORITY

00:38:39.817 --> 00:38:41.585
THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF THE THE

00:38:41.652 --> 00:38:42.720
GROWTH IS IT'S A LOT OF WEAR

00:38:42.787 --> 00:38:44.355
THAT THE POPULATION GROWTH IS

00:38:44.422 --> 00:38:45.656
IT'S A LOT OF WHERE THE THE

00:38:45.723 --> 00:38:48.259
ECONOMIC NEEDS ARE IT'S A LOT OF

00:38:48.325 --> 00:38:48.626
WHERE.

00:38:48.693 --> 00:38:52.963
THE FUTURE OF THE WORK FORCE IS

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:54.565
COMING FROM AND FRANKLY IT'S A

00:38:54.632 --> 00:38:56.300
PLACE WHERE WE NOT PAID AS MUCH

00:38:56.367 --> 00:38:58.235
ATTENTION AS A STATE AND I THINK

00:38:58.302 --> 00:39:00.071
THERE'S A REAL OPPORTUNITY.

00:39:00.137 --> 00:39:03.340
TO ENSURE THAT WHAT INLAND

00:39:03.407 --> 00:39:04.341
EMPIRE NEEDS.

00:39:04.408 --> 00:39:04.942
WE HELP.

00:39:05.009 --> 00:39:05.676
AND WHAT CENTRAL CALIFORNIA

00:39:05.743 --> 00:39:07.545
NEEDS WE HELP IT'S NOT THAT WE

00:39:07.611 --> 00:39:09.146
HAVE THE ANSWERS IT'S HELP AND

00:39:09.213 --> 00:39:10.681
WORK WITH THEM. TO HELP

00:39:10.748 --> 00:39:13.050
UNDERSTAND THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS

00:39:13.117 --> 00:39:14.952
AND THEN WORK WITH THEM TO HELP

00:39:15.019 --> 00:39:17.922
ENABLE THAT [inaudible]

00:39:17.988 --> 00:39:19.490
THE CHAPEL.

00:39:19.557 --> 00:39:20.324
YOU MENTION ABOUT EXPERT --

00:39:20.391 --> 00:39:22.626
AND I'M JUST WONDERING OF WHAT

00:39:22.693 --> 00:39:26.597
DE IMPACTS HAVE BEEN UP WITH THE

00:39:26.664 --> 00:39:29.033
MOST RECENT TRADE WAR ARE AND

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:31.235
HOW IT HAS IMPACTED --

00:39:31.302 --> 00:39:35.473
VERY SECTORS ARE WHO ARE

00:39:35.539 --> 00:39:37.408
CONDUCTING BUSINESSES HERE IN

00:39:37.475 --> 00:39:39.677
THE STATES OR IN AND A IN

00:39:39.744 --> 00:39:42.613
EXPORTING FOR EXAMPLE AND HOW

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.215
BOB DAVIE COULD COPE WITH THE

00:39:44.281 --> 00:39:45.883
SITUATION.

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:47.885
NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE.

00:39:47.952 --> 00:39:49.286
THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER TRY

00:39:49.353 --> 00:39:52.289
THAT THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION --

00:39:52.356 --> 00:39:55.292
THE OF THE US IS TRYING TO GET A

00:39:55.359 --> 00:39:56.660
BETTER HANDLE ON THAT IN TERMS

00:39:56.727 --> 00:39:58.195
OF ECONOMIC STATISTICS IN THE

00:39:58.262 --> 00:39:59.964
STATE IS AS WELL --

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:03.033
SO WE DON'T HAVE A COMPLETE VIEW

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:04.301
OF IT IN A YOU KNOW.

00:40:04.368 --> 00:40:04.935
COMPREHENSIVE WHAT WHAT I WOULD

00:40:05.002 --> 00:40:06.837
SAY IS THE INDICATIONS ARE AND

00:40:06.904 --> 00:40:08.272
CERTAINLY THE ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE

00:40:08.339 --> 00:40:09.540
WHEN I'M OUT ACROSS THE STATE

00:40:09.607 --> 00:40:10.541
AND I'M SURE YOU'RE HEARING IT

00:40:10.608 --> 00:40:13.577
AS WELL IS EXTREMELY NEGATIVE.

00:40:13.644 --> 00:40:16.046
IT IS A TERRACE HAVE HELPED

00:40:16.113 --> 00:40:19.450
CREATE A BARRIER TO HIGH QUALITY

00:40:19.517 --> 00:40:22.386
BUSINESSES WHO WANT TO EXPORT.

00:40:22.453 --> 00:40:24.455
BECAUSE IT'S PREVENTED THEM IN

00:40:24.522 --> 00:40:26.023
TERMS OF THEIR ABILITY HAVE

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:27.758
ACCESS TO OTHER MARKETS AND IT'S

00:40:27.825 --> 00:40:29.260
ALSO RAISE THEIR COSTS. FOR

00:40:29.326 --> 00:40:30.694
IMPORTS THAT THEY HAVE COMING IN

00:40:30.761 --> 00:40:32.363
TO TRY AND HELP THEIR BUSINESS

00:40:32.429 --> 00:40:34.899
SUCCEED --

00:40:34.965 --> 00:40:38.335
ALMOST EVERY ECHO ARE A BAD

00:40:38.402 --> 00:40:39.703
ECONOMIC TOOL.

00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:41.539
AND SO TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON

00:40:41.605 --> 00:40:43.407
EXACTLY THE IMPACT OF THAT IS

00:40:43.474 --> 00:40:44.041
SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE TAKING A

00:40:44.108 --> 00:40:46.710
LOOK AT MY PERSONAL BELIEF IS

00:40:46.777 --> 00:40:47.845
THAT IT IS.

00:40:47.912 --> 00:40:49.814
UP THE EVEN MORE NEGATIVE FOR

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.315
CALIFORNIA THAN IT IS FOR MOST

00:40:51.382 --> 00:40:52.583
OF THE REST OF THE COUNTRY

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:53.284
BECAUSE WE ARE MUCH MORE

00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:55.586
EXPLORATORIUM ALMOST BY

00:40:55.653 --> 00:40:56.153
DEFINITION IT'S GOING TO BE

00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:57.054
WORSE.

00:40:57.121 --> 00:40:58.756
AND SECONDLY IT IS WHEN WE GET

00:40:58.823 --> 00:41:00.958
INTO WORD AFFECTS PARTICULAR

00:41:01.025 --> 00:41:02.726
INDUSTRIES AND PARTICULAR DROP

00:41:02.793 --> 00:41:04.762
GEOGRAPHIES IT'S UNFORTUNATELY

00:41:04.829 --> 00:41:06.263
MOST LIKELY TO HURT THOSE THAT

00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:07.731
CAN LEAST AFFORD FOR IT TO BE

00:41:07.798 --> 00:41:08.766
HEARD.

00:41:08.833 --> 00:41:10.868
SO SMALL MANUFACTURERS WHO RELY

00:41:10.935 --> 00:41:13.470
ON INTERNATIONAL EXPECTS PORTS

00:41:13.537 --> 00:41:14.705
AND FOR THEIR PRODUCTS TO COME

00:41:14.772 --> 00:41:16.173
IN AGRICULTURE WHO ARE

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:18.075
FUNDAMENTALLY EPENDENT ON THE

00:41:18.142 --> 00:41:20.144
STATE ON EXPORTS.

00:41:20.211 --> 00:41:22.713
THOSE WHO ARE IMPORTING PRODUCTS

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:24.682
FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD TO

00:41:24.748 --> 00:41:26.450
ADD VALUE TO THEM IN CALIFORNIA

00:41:26.517 --> 00:41:27.852
OR HURT WHEN THOSE INPUT COSTS

00:41:27.918 --> 00:41:29.520
COME UP BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PASS

00:41:29.587 --> 00:41:31.522
THAT ON TO TWO OTHERS VERY

00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:32.122
EASILY.

00:41:32.189 --> 00:41:33.357
AND THEN THOSE WERE BUYING THOSE

00:41:33.424 --> 00:41:35.125
ARE HURT TOO SO IT IS A HORRIBLE

00:41:35.192 --> 00:41:37.094
ECONOMIC POLICY AND TRYING TO

00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:39.230
THINK ABOUT HOW CALIFORNIA.

00:41:39.296 --> 00:41:41.699
CAN STE ARTICULATE WHY WE NEED

00:41:41.765 --> 00:41:43.067
TO HAVE A PRODUCTIVE GLOBAL

00:41:43.133 --> 00:41:46.470
RELATIONSHIP IS KIND OF WHERE

00:41:46.537 --> 00:41:48.339
WE'RE I THINK WE OUGHT TO BE HAD.

00:41:48.405 --> 00:41:49.006
TO ADD ON TO THAT WERE ARE SOME

00:41:49.073 --> 00:41:51.408
OPPORTUNITIES WERE CALIFORNIA

00:41:51.475 --> 00:41:53.644
CAN ENHANCE OUR GLOBAL

00:41:53.711 --> 00:41:56.146
COMPETITIVE NEST WITHIN THIS

00:41:56.213 --> 00:41:58.449
LARGER MARKET THANK YOU AB.

00:41:58.515 --> 00:41:59.817
SO WE ARE VERY EARLY IN THE

00:41:59.884 --> 00:42:01.719
PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THAT FULL

00:42:01.785 --> 00:42:03.687
AND COMPLETE STRATEGY --

00:42:03.754 --> 00:42:05.456
THE ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT IS

00:42:05.522 --> 00:42:07.892
WHERE ARE THE EXISTING LARGE

00:42:07.958 --> 00:42:09.793
TRADING PARTNERS OF THE OF THE

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:11.729
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:42:11.795 --> 00:42:13.130
SO THOSE WOULD BE --

00:42:13.197 --> 00:42:16.400
PLACES THE OF THEIR GEOGRAPHIC

00:42:16.467 --> 00:42:19.036
LOCATION CERTAINLY TO THE SOUTH

00:42:19.103 --> 00:42:21.005
MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA TO

00:42:21.071 --> 00:42:22.573
THE NORTH CANADA.

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.275
CHINA SOUTHEAST ASIA MORE

00:42:24.341 --> 00:42:25.876
BROADLY WE HAVE AN IMPORTANT

00:42:25.943 --> 00:42:27.478
RELATIONSHIP WITH INDIA SO IT'S

00:42:27.544 --> 00:42:29.446
IT'S THE ECONOMY IS WHERE WE

00:42:29.513 --> 00:42:31.682
HAVE EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS AND

00:42:31.749 --> 00:42:33.150
POTENTIAL FOR LARGER INTERACTION.

00:42:33.217 --> 00:42:35.085
IT'S ALSO AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT

00:42:35.152 --> 00:42:37.421
TO THINK ABOUT THE THE THE

00:42:37.488 --> 00:42:38.822
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY FLOWS THE

00:42:38.889 --> 00:42:40.090
GO BETWEEN DIFFERENT PARTS OF

00:42:40.157 --> 00:42:41.058
THE COUNTRY SO IT'S NOT JUST

00:42:41.125 --> 00:42:44.962
GOODS THAT MOVE ON SHIPS ACROSS

00:42:45.029 --> 00:42:46.997
OR ON TRAINS OR ON TRUCKS ACROSS

00:42:47.064 --> 00:42:47.932
BORDERS.

00:42:47.998 --> 00:42:49.667
IT'S ALSO THE THE FLOWS OF

00:42:49.733 --> 00:42:52.403
INFORMATION AND PEOPLE AND IDEAS

00:42:52.469 --> 00:42:54.004
THAT WE NEED TO THINK HARD ABOUT.

00:42:54.071 --> 00:42:55.306
AND THEN FINALLY I DO THINK

00:42:55.372 --> 00:42:55.839
THERE'S AN ELEMENT OF THE

00:42:55.906 --> 00:42:58.175
SWITCHES JUST FACING UP TO THE

00:42:58.242 --> 00:43:00.611
REALITY OF OUR CONNECTION WITH

00:43:00.678 --> 00:43:02.613
MANY OF OUR RESIDENTS ARE FROM

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:04.782
OUR FIRST GENERATION WERE SECOND

00:43:04.848 --> 00:43:06.050
GENERATION RESIDENTS FROM OTHER

00:43:06.116 --> 00:43:07.251
PARTS OF THE WORLD HAVE

00:43:07.318 --> 00:43:08.752
IMPORTANT CONNECTIONS TO THEM.

00:43:08.819 --> 00:43:10.721
AND SO HOW DO WE HELP INSURE

00:43:10.788 --> 00:43:12.690
THAT THAT CONNECTION IS ENABLED

00:43:12.756 --> 00:43:15.059
NOT DISRUPTED BY BY --

00:43:15.125 --> 00:43:17.127
INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITY OBVIOUSLY

00:43:17.194 --> 00:43:19.029
AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT THIS IS

00:43:19.096 --> 00:43:20.531
FEDERAL POLICY ANDERSON AND

00:43:20.597 --> 00:43:21.966
THAT'S NOT OUR ROLE.

00:43:22.032 --> 00:43:23.701
BUT OUR ABILITY TO ARTICULATE

00:43:23.767 --> 00:43:25.669
THAT HAVING A GLOBALLY RELEVANT

00:43:25.736 --> 00:43:27.338
STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH CAN BE

00:43:27.404 --> 00:43:28.872
GOOD FOR OUR CITIZENS AND OUR

COUNTRY?

00:48:33.443 --> 00:48:35.946
THAT WE CAN HELP AND TRANSFER

00:48:36.013 --> 00:48:38.749

WHAT'S WORKING IT'S REALLY ABOUT

00:48:41.818 --> 00:48:43.053
ACCELERATING THOSE GREAT

00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:44.721
SUCCESSES AND THERE ARE ALL OVER

00:48:44.788 --> 00:48:47.991
THE STATE.

HOW DO YOU WOULD YOU SEE THE

00:48:49.159 --> 00:48:52.362
STATE'S TRANSITION INTO A LOWER

00:48:52.429 --> 00:48:53.997
CARBON ECONOMY IMPACTING

00:48:54.064 --> 00:48:55.899
BUSINESSES AND OUR WORK FORCE

00:48:55.966 --> 00:48:56.967

00:48:57.034 --> 00:48:58.101
SURE.

00:48:58.168 --> 00:48:59.803
ANOTHER GOOD QUESTION AROUND HOW

00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:01.305
WE THINK ABOUT AND SHOULD BE

00:49:01.371 --> 00:49:02.706
THINKING ABOUT.

00:49:02.773 --> 00:49:04.975
THE INTERSECTION OF THOSE GOALS

00:49:05.042 --> 00:49:07.277
THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMIC SUMMIT

00:49:07.344 --> 00:49:08.545
CALLED THE TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE

00:49:08.612 --> 00:49:09.880
AND YOU MENTIONED THAT IN YOUR

00:49:09.946 --> 00:49:10.614
INTRODUCTORY.

00:49:10.681 --> 00:49:11.715
HAVE PEOPLE USE DIFFERENT

00:49:11.782 --> 00:49:14.184
TERMINOLOGY FOR WHAT THAT IS BUT

00:49:14.251 --> 00:49:16.086
THE WAY I THINK ABOUT IT IS IT'S

00:49:16.153 --> 00:49:17.654
SMART INVESTING AND SMART

00:49:17.721 --> 00:49:19.456
BUSINESS IF YOU REALLY ARE THERE

00:49:19.523 --> 00:49:20.490
FOR THE LONGER TERM WHAT YOU

00:49:20.557 --> 00:49:21.658
WANT TO BE DOING IS YOU DON'T

00:49:21.725 --> 00:49:22.592
WANT TO BE DESTROYING THE

00:49:22.659 --> 00:49:23.994
ECONOMY AND THE ENVIRONMENT

00:49:24.061 --> 00:49:24.394
AROUND.

00:49:24.461 --> 00:49:26.029
YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO BE DOING IS

00:49:26.096 --> 00:49:27.497
HELPING ENSURE THAT YOUR ACTIONS

00:49:27.564 --> 00:49:29.633

AND A HIGH QUALITY.

00:49:31.134 --> 00:49:33.270
ENVIRONMENT AROUND YOU AND SO.

00:49:33.337 --> 00:49:35.439
THE WHAT I THINK MOST BUSINESSES

00:49:35.505 --> 00:49:36.973
LOOK FOR IN THAT REGARD IS

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:39.209
CLARITY AND CONSISTENCY OF WHAT

00:49:39.276 --> 00:49:41.645
THE THE POLICIES ARE.

00:49:41.712 --> 00:49:42.813
THEY CAN OPERATE AN ENVIRONMENT

00:49:42.879 --> 00:49:44.514
WHERE THEY KNOW WHAT THE THE

00:49:44.581 --> 00:49:46.717
RULES ARE AND WHAT THE THE

00:49:46.783 --> 00:49:50.687
NATURE OF THE THE OPPORTUNITY IS

00:49:50.754 --> 00:49:52.055
IN MOST OF THE REST OF THE WORLD.

00:49:52.122 --> 00:49:54.024
CARBON IS PRICED INTO HOW WE HOW

THEIR DECISION MAKING ALREADY.

00:50:02.265 --> 00:50:03.400

00:50:03.467 --> 00:50:04.267
WE ENSURE THAT.

00:50:04.334 --> 00:50:05.902
THAT ARE.

00:50:05.969 --> 00:50:07.137
CLIMATE OBJECTIVES ARE LINED

00:50:33.196 --> 00:50:34.431
A PRIVATE CAPITAL QUESTION

00:50:34.498 --> 00:50:36.366
PRIVATE CAPITAL HAS ITS VIEWS

00:50:36.433 --> 00:50:37.968
ABOUT WHERE IT WANTS TO GO.

00:50:38.034 --> 00:50:41.405

00:52:01.985 --> 00:52:04.688
BRIEF FRAME WORK ON THIS AGENDA

00:52:04.754 --> 00:52:05.822
ITEM.

00:52:05.889 --> 00:52:07.190
WITH AN ECONOMY LARGER THAN ALL

00:52:07.257 --> 00:52:09.259

AND YOU'LL SEE BUDGET EXCEEDING

00:52:11.628 --> 00:52:12.796
ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN A

00:52:12.863 --> 00:52:13.864
CULTURAL.

00:52:13.930 --> 00:52:15.765
A CULTURE OF DIVERSITY AND

00:52:15.832 --> 00:52:16.633
INNOVATION.

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:18.635
CALIFORNIA COULD BE READY TO

00:52:18.702 --> 00:52:20.270
EMBRACE AN INCLUSIVE THE

00:52:20.337 --> 00:52:22.472
DEVELOPMENT MODEL A MODEL THAT

00:52:22.539 --> 00:52:24.508
BUILDS RESILIENCE RESILIENCY AND

00:52:24.574 --> 00:52:26.209
SUPPORT TO REGIONAL AND

00:52:26.276 --> 00:52:27.744
NEIGHBORHOOD PRIORITIES WHAT

00:52:27.811 --> 00:52:29.880
CREATING COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES

00:52:29.946 --> 00:52:32.582
FOR BUSINESSES AND WORKERS ALIKE.

00:52:32.649 --> 00:52:34.451
IMPLEMENTING THIS MODEL WILL

00:52:34.518 --> 00:52:37.287
TAKE SOME NEW WAYS WE HAVE ASKED

00:52:37.354 --> 00:52:39.055
OUR NEXT SPEAKER SPEAKER DOCTOR

00:52:39.122 --> 00:52:40.490
HIS SHOES HERNANDEZ PRINCIPLE OF

00:52:40.557 --> 00:52:43.293
J. C. H. RESEARCH TO HELP US

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:45.462
LOOK MORE DEEPLY AT WHAT IT WILL

00:52:45.529 --> 00:52:46.630
TAKE TO SUPPORT.

00:52:46.696 --> 00:52:48.198
AN INCLUSIVE DEVELOPMENT MODEL

00:52:48.265 --> 00:52:50.734
BASED ON SUSTAINABLE PRINCIPLES

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.435
DOCTOR HERNANDEZ HAS SPENT HIS

00:52:52.502 --> 00:52:53.637
CAREER DEVELOPING AND

00:52:53.703 --> 00:52:54.704
IMPLEMENTING COMMUNITY BASED

00:52:54.771 --> 00:52:56.773
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES

00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:58.675
HE'LL BE USING HIS WORK WITH THE

00:52:58.742 --> 00:52:59.876
FRANKLY NEIGHBORHOOD IN

00:52:59.943 --> 00:53:01.745
SACRAMENTO AS A REAL WORLD

00:53:01.811 --> 00:53:02.679
EXAMPLE.

00:53:02.746 --> 00:53:05.181
OF HOW LEGISLATION TRANSLATES TO

00:53:05.248 --> 00:53:07.417
PRACTICE OUR DOCTORS MANTIS IF

00:53:07.484 --> 00:53:11.254
YOU LIKE TO BE ON GOOD MORNING

00:53:11.321 --> 00:53:11.821
THANK YOU ALL FOR HAVING ME

00:53:11.888 --> 00:53:12.689
TODAY.

00:53:12.756 --> 00:53:14.824
MY SHORT PRESENTATION WILL FOCUS.

00:53:14.891 --> 00:53:16.826
ON HOW TO OPERATIONALIZE CLIMATE

00:53:16.893 --> 00:53:18.061
CHANGE POLICY AT THE

00:53:18.128 --> 00:53:19.396
NEIGHBORHOODS SCALE.

00:53:19.462 --> 00:53:22.198
AND HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD.

00:53:22.265 --> 00:53:23.500
AND CLOSER.

00:53:23.567 --> 00:53:25.502
TOWARDS THE GOVERNOR'S QUEST FOR

00:53:25.569 --> 00:53:28.905
MORE INCLUSIVE ECONOMY.

00:53:28.972 --> 00:53:30.407
WE NOW HAVE AN ABUNDANCE OF THE

00:53:30.473 --> 00:53:32.709
LEGISLATIVE MANDATES THAT FOCUS

00:53:32.776 --> 00:53:34.110
ON ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP.

00:53:34.177 --> 00:53:35.412
AND A KEY PART OF THIS

00:53:35.478 --> 00:53:38.014
LEGISLATION AIMS TO ADDRESS ANY

00:53:38.081 --> 00:53:39.449
QUALITY IN OUR CITIES.

00:53:39.516 --> 00:53:41.818
SO POLICY NOW PLACES AN EMPHASIS

00:53:41.885 --> 00:53:43.587
ON REPAIRING DISADVANTAGED

00:53:43.653 --> 00:53:45.322
COMMUNITIES SO THEY CAN ACTIVELY

00:53:45.388 --> 00:53:47.023
PARTICIPATE IN A NEW GREEN

00:53:47.090 --> 00:53:47.691
ECONOMY [inaudible]

00:53:47.757 --> 00:53:49.659
HOWEVER.

00:53:49.726 --> 00:53:52.562
REGION'S IN MUNICIPALITIES ARE

00:53:52.629 --> 00:53:54.397
NOT SURE HOW TO GO ABOUT THIS.

00:53:54.464 --> 00:53:56.099
REGIONAL PLANNING IS NOT REALLY

00:53:56.166 --> 00:53:58.668
DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THE CHANGING

00:53:58.735 --> 00:53:59.135
NEEDS OF DISADVANTAGED

00:53:59.202 --> 00:54:00.537
COMMUNITIES.

00:54:00.604 --> 00:54:02.005
SO THE IMPORTANT QUESTION HERE

00:54:02.072 --> 00:54:04.507
IS HOW DO MUNICIPALITIES MOVE

00:54:04.574 --> 00:54:06.176
FORWARD WITH THIS INCLUSIVE

00:54:06.242 --> 00:54:10.046
ECONOMY AGENDA.

00:54:10.113 --> 00:54:12.616
AT ITS ROOT.

00:54:12.682 --> 00:54:13.483
CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATION IS

00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:15.518
BASED UPON THE CONCEPT OF

00:54:15.585 --> 00:54:17.988
SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGIES.

00:54:18.054 --> 00:54:19.689
THE CONCEPT OF SUSTAINABILITY IS

00:54:19.756 --> 00:54:21.091
VERY SIMPLE.

00:54:21.157 --> 00:54:23.593
ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN A BALANCE

00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:25.028
OF ECONOMIC STEWARDSHIP.

00:54:25.095 --> 00:54:26.930
ECONOMIC GROWTH.

00:54:26.997 --> 00:54:28.798
ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP

00:54:28.865 --> 00:54:30.900
ECONOMIC GROWTH AND EQUITY.

00:54:30.967 --> 00:54:32.902
ALL OF OUR PUBLIC INVESTMENTS

00:54:32.969 --> 00:54:34.671
MUST WORK TO MAINTAIN THIS

00:54:34.738 --> 00:54:37.040
BALANCE WITHOUT COMPROMISING.

00:54:37.107 --> 00:54:38.274
THE ABILITY TO MEET OUR FUTURE

00:54:38.341 --> 00:54:39.876
NEEDS.

00:54:39.943 --> 00:54:41.411
WE MUST ENCOURAGE ECONOMIC

00:54:41.478 --> 00:54:43.513
GROWTH THROUGH AN EQUITABLE

00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:44.948
DISTRIBUTION.

00:54:45.015 --> 00:54:46.282
OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC

00:54:46.349 --> 00:54:47.617
OPPORTUNITY.

00:54:47.684 --> 00:54:50.353
IN THIS MANNER WE RESTORE AND

00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:52.522
REVITALIZE DISADVANTAGED

00:54:52.589 --> 00:54:53.823
COMMUNITIES WHAT BRINGING

00:54:53.890 --> 00:54:58.828
CAPACITY FOR RESILIENCE.

00:54:58.895 --> 00:55:00.830
SO IN THIS MODEL.

00:55:00.897 --> 00:55:02.732
THERE'S FIVE BASIC ELEMENTS THAT

00:55:02.799 --> 00:55:05.035
ARE ESSENTIAL TO ACHIEVING

00:55:05.101 --> 00:55:06.503
NEIGHBORHOOD SUSTAINABILITY.

00:55:06.569 --> 00:55:09.506
EDUCATION EMPLOYMENT HOUSING

00:55:09.572 --> 00:55:11.841
HEALTH CARE AND WILL THE

00:55:11.908 --> 00:55:13.143
COMMUNITY IN OPPORTUNITIES.

00:55:13.209 --> 00:55:15.612
WE MUST ALSO LOOK AT THE SOFT

00:55:15.679 --> 00:55:17.747
AND HARD INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

00:55:17.814 --> 00:55:20.083
CONNECTIVE TISSUE.

00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:21.751
TRANSPORTATION ENERGY.

00:55:21.818 --> 00:55:25.455
BUILDINGS ROADS BROADBAND EXCEPT.

00:55:25.522 --> 00:55:27.924
FOR THESE TIED TOGETHER THOSE

00:55:27.991 --> 00:55:29.859
FIVE IMPORTANT SOCIAL GOODS.

00:55:29.926 --> 00:55:30.760
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL

00:55:30.827 --> 00:55:33.997
INTERDEPENDENT IF ONE GOES BAD

00:55:34.064 --> 00:55:35.632
THEY ALL GO BACK.

00:55:35.699 --> 00:55:36.633
SO WHEN WE READ VALUE WAIT

00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:38.101
NEIGHBORHOOD SYSTEMS WE SHOULD

00:55:38.168 --> 00:55:41.004
ASK SOME VERY SIMPLE QUESTIONS.

00:55:41.071 --> 00:55:42.405
ARE THESE NEIGHBORHOODS SYSTEMS

00:55:42.472 --> 00:55:43.907
RELIABLE.

00:55:43.973 --> 00:55:47.410
CAN I DEPEND ON WHAT NEEDS TO BE

00:55:47.477 --> 00:55:48.244
RESTORED.

00:55:48.311 --> 00:55:50.613
HOW DO WE FIX THAT?

00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:52.282
AND ARE THEY RESILIENT.

00:55:52.348 --> 00:55:53.516
HOW DO WE RECOVER [inaudible]

00:55:53.583 --> 00:55:57.921
AND WITH TITLE SIX OF THE CIVIL

00:55:57.987 --> 00:55:59.656
RIGHTS ACT.

00:55:59.723 --> 00:56:01.024
ARE THESE PUBLIC INVESTMENTS

00:56:01.091 --> 00:56:03.259
BEING USED TO REPAIR AND

00:56:03.326 --> 00:56:04.394
REGENERATE THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS

00:56:04.461 --> 00:56:06.396
LEFT BEHIND.

00:56:06.463 --> 00:56:08.398
THIS IS THE ANALYTICAL LANDS

00:56:08.465 --> 00:56:10.734
THAT ENSURES THAT WE INCLUDE ALL

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:17.373
NEIGHBORHOODS IN CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:19.309
WHEN WE USE THIS APPROACH PUBLIC

00:56:19.375 --> 00:56:20.610
INVESTMENT STRATEGIES FOR

00:56:20.677 --> 00:56:21.945
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES BECOME

00:56:22.011 --> 00:56:24.614
RESTORATIVE REGENERATIVE BY

00:56:24.681 --> 00:56:25.582
DESIGN?

00:56:25.648 --> 00:56:28.051
ECONOMIC INVESTMENT PRESERVES

00:56:28.118 --> 00:56:29.452
OUR NATURAL RESOURCES.

00:56:29.519 --> 00:56:30.787
WHILE PROVIDING SOCIAL

00:56:30.854 --> 00:56:32.822
PROTECTIONS IN MARKET ACCESS TO

00:56:32.889 --> 00:56:34.324
ALL NEIGHBORHOODS.

00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:36.593
I WANT TO STRESS THAT THIS MEANS

00:56:36.659 --> 00:56:38.394
WE USED THE NEIGHBORHOOD AS AN

00:56:38.461 --> 00:56:41.331
IMPORTANT UNIT OF ANALYSIS.

00:56:41.397 --> 00:56:42.565
IT'S A LAYER OF GOVERNANCE

00:56:42.632 --> 00:56:44.567
THAT'S MISSING FROM THE

AND INCREASE OUR HOUSING STOCK.

01:01:15.171 --> 01:01:16.172
SO THERE'S A LOGIC TO ALL OF

PARTICIPANT AND CLIMATE CHANGE.

01:01:49.472 --> 01:01:51.707
SO IF WE WANT TO MOVE FORWARD.

01:01:51.774 --> 01:01:53.276
WITH THE INCLUSIVE ECONOMY.

01:01:53.342 --> 01:01:55.278
WE NEED ENERGY POLICY THAT

01:01:55.344 --> 01:01:57.980
ENCOURAGES.

01:01:58.047 --> 01:01:59.615
TAX OR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

01:01:59.682 --> 01:02:01.884
TO PARTICIPATE IN ENERGY MARKETS

01:02:01.951 --> 01:02:04.687
AS PRODUCERS NOT AS DEPENDENT.

01:02:04.754 --> 01:02:07.657
DEPENDENCE ON UTILITY SUBSIDIES.

01:02:07.723 --> 01:02:09.959
WE NEED TRANSIT POLICY THAT

01:02:10.026 --> 01:02:11.794
BRINGS TRANSIT TO HOUSING.

01:02:11.861 --> 01:02:14.297
RATHER THAN HOUSING TO TRANSIT.

01:02:14.363 --> 01:02:16.165
WE NEED HOUSING POLICIES THAT

01:02:16.232 --> 01:02:18.634
FINANCIALLY SUPPORT NEIGHBORHOOD

01:02:18.701 --> 01:02:21.270
SPECIFIC NEEDS.

01:02:21.337 --> 01:02:22.205
WE NEED TO STRIP IT OF HEALTH

01:02:22.271 --> 01:02:24.474
CARE DELIVERY THAT BRINGS ACCESS

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:27.844
TO THOSE WHO NEED IT THE MOST.

01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:29.979
IF WE WANT TO MOVE TOWARDS THIS

01:02:30.046 --> 01:02:31.314
INCLUSIVE ECONOMY WE SHOULD

01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:33.549
RECOGNIZE THAT REGIONAL PLANTS

01:02:33.616 --> 01:02:35.718
ARE NOT REALLY DESIGNED TO SOLVE

01:02:35.785 --> 01:02:37.620
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD DISTRICTS.

01:02:37.687 --> 01:02:39.255
INVESTMENT READY PROJECTS AND

01:02:39.322 --> 01:02:40.690
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

01:02:40.756 --> 01:02:42.492
ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT OVERLAP

01:02:42.558 --> 01:02:45.895
WITH OPPORTUNITIES ONS REQUIRED

01:02:45.962 --> 01:02:47.263
INTENSIVE AMOUNT OF PLANNING.

01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:49.532
NEIGHBORHOOD SPECIFIC PLANNING

01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:50.666
IS ESSENTIAL TO ACHIEVING THOSE

01:02:50.733 --> 01:02:53.069
GOALS BUT THERE IS VIRTUALLY NO

01:02:53.136 --> 01:02:55.905
FUNDING FOR SUCH TYPE.

01:02:55.972 --> 01:02:57.039
THE TRANSFORMING KEL CLIMATE

01:02:57.106 --> 01:02:59.509
COMMUNITIES IS A GOOD START.

01:02:59.575 --> 01:03:01.477
BUT REQUIRES MUCH MORE FUNDING

01:03:01.544 --> 01:03:04.814
TO BRING THIS CONCEPT TO SCALE.

01:03:04.881 --> 01:03:06.516
AND LOCAL AGENCIES NEED TO NEED

01:03:06.582 --> 01:03:07.817
RESOURCES TO CREATE THE

01:03:07.884 --> 01:03:09.152
DECENTRALIZED PLANNING

01:03:09.218 --> 01:03:10.853
MECHANISMS NEEDED FOR

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:12.088
NEIGHBORHOOD PLANNING.

01:03:12.155 --> 01:03:14.257
WE JUST SIMPLY CANNOT DO THIS

01:03:14.323 --> 01:03:19.495
ONE NEIGHBORHOOD AT A TIME.

01:03:19.562 --> 01:03:20.129
SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE DO THIS

01:03:20.196 --> 01:03:21.097
RIGHT.

01:03:21.164 --> 01:03:22.131
WE HAVE NEIGHBORHOOD SPECIFIC

01:03:22.198 --> 01:03:23.499
INFRASTRUCTURE BECOMES A

01:03:23.566 --> 01:03:26.702
PRIORITY BEFORE EXTERNAL PROFIT.

01:03:26.769 --> 01:03:28.204
WE SEE JOBS AND ENERGY HEALTH

01:03:28.271 --> 01:03:29.639
TRANSPORTATION AND HOUSING WE

AVOID DISPLACEMENT WE AVOID

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:32.942
GENTRIFICATION AS PEOPLE WILL

01:03:33.009 --> 01:03:34.410
STAND OR NEIGHBORHOODS.

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:36.245
WE SEE EDUCATIONAL VOCATIONAL

01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:37.747
EDUCATIONAL AND VOCATIONAL

01:03:37.813 --> 01:03:40.016
PATHWAYS AND MOST IMPORTANT WE

01:03:40.082 --> 01:03:42.218
BEGIN TO MEET OUR TITLE SIX

01:03:42.285 --> 01:03:44.187
OBLIGATIONS FOR EQUAL

01:03:44.253 --> 01:03:47.256
DISTRIBUTION OF PUBLIC FUNDS.

01:03:47.323 --> 01:03:48.824
THIS IS HOW WE CAN CONNECT THE

01:03:48.891 --> 01:03:49.992
DOTS BETWEEN CLIMATE CHANGE

01:03:50.059 --> 01:03:51.394
POLICY.

01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:53.262
AND REVITALIZING OUR

01:03:53.329 --> 01:03:54.063
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:54.363
[inaudible]

01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:57.266
THANK YOU.

01:03:57.333 --> 01:03:59.802
THANK YOU DOCTOR HERNANDEZ.

01:03:59.869 --> 01:04:01.537
I WILL START OFF.

01:04:01.604 --> 01:04:02.405
WITH A QUICK QUESTION BEFORE

01:04:02.471 --> 01:04:04.307
OPENING UP TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS

01:04:04.373 --> 01:04:07.510
HOW DO YOU RECOMMEND MODIFYING --

01:04:07.577 --> 01:04:10.279
CITY PLANNING MODELS TO MEET THE

01:04:10.346 --> 01:04:11.981
NEEDS OF OUR LOW INCOME

01:04:12.048 --> 01:04:13.616
NEIGHBORHOODS.

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:16.085
A VERY GOOD START WAS SB ONE

01:04:16.152 --> 01:04:17.053
THOUSAND THAT REQUIRES

01:04:17.119 --> 01:04:19.622
MUNICIPALITIES TO INCLUDE

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:20.690
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE BECAUSE

01:04:20.756 --> 01:04:23.192
JUSTICE COMPONENTS INTO THEIR

01:04:23.259 --> 01:04:23.526
GENERAL PLAN.

01:04:23.593 --> 01:04:25.394
THIS IS REALLY AT THE HEART OF

01:04:25.461 --> 01:04:27.330
THIS CONNECTION BETWEEN

01:04:27.396 --> 01:04:29.665
MUNICIPALITIES.

01:04:29.732 --> 01:04:31.033
AND NEIGHBORHOODS.

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:32.501
MISS ABOUT THESE DO NOT HAVE THE

01:04:32.568 --> 01:04:35.471
RESOURCES TO SCALE DOWN TO THE

01:04:35.538 --> 01:04:36.239
NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:04:36.305 --> 01:04:37.907
THEY PLANNED FOR BIG TICKET

01:04:37.974 --> 01:04:40.109
ITEMS LIKE ARENAS AND DOWNTOWN

01:04:40.176 --> 01:04:41.544
DEVELOPMENT.

01:04:41.611 --> 01:04:43.145
AND THEY DO VERY GOOD AT IT.

01:04:43.212 --> 01:04:44.680
BUT THERE HAS TO BE A BALANCE

01:04:44.747 --> 01:04:46.482
BETWEEN WHAT HAPPENS.

01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:47.450
IN THESE DISADVANTAGED

01:04:47.516 --> 01:04:50.886
COMMUNITIES AND HOW TO MAKE THE

01:04:50.953 --> 01:04:52.622
LEGISLATION OPERATIONAL.

01:04:52.688 --> 01:04:53.689
SO THEY NEED MORE RESOURCES TO

01:04:53.756 --> 01:04:55.992
DO THIS TYPE OF PLANNING.

01:04:56.058 --> 01:04:58.194
AND THAT SHOULD BE BUILT INTO

01:04:58.261 --> 01:04:59.795
THESE GENERAL PLANS AT THE

01:04:59.862 --> 01:05:01.764
MUNICIPALITY LEVEL.

01:05:01.831 --> 01:05:02.498
THANK YOU AND WHAT AND WHAT

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:04.300
WOULD YOU SAY ARE THE MOST

01:05:04.367 --> 01:05:06.569
IMPORTANT NEXT STEPS THE STATE

01:05:06.636 --> 01:05:08.004
CAN TAKE.

01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:09.672
I TO SUPPORT OF MORE MOVE UPWARD

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:11.974
MOBILITY WITHIN AT THE SAME

01:05:12.041 --> 01:05:14.243
NEIGHBORHOODS.

01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:15.544
AT THE STATE LEVEL.

01:05:15.611 --> 01:05:17.980
THERE NEEDS TO BE A A MECHANISM

01:05:18.047 --> 01:05:21.083
WHERE WE ACTUALLY.

01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:22.952
PUT A PRIORITY ON NEIGHBORHOOD

01:05:23.019 --> 01:05:24.387
SCALE PLANNING.

01:05:24.453 --> 01:05:27.523
WE HAVE LEVELS OF GOVERNANCE.

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:30.726
STATE REGION MUNICIPALITY AS AN

01:05:30.793 --> 01:05:33.596
HOUSEHOLD WE MISS THIS

01:05:33.663 --> 01:05:35.164
NEIGHBORHOOD CONCEPT.

01:05:35.231 --> 01:05:36.265
THAT MEANS THE PENALTIES ARE

01:05:36.332 --> 01:05:38.267
RESPONSIBLE FOR BUT HAVE NO

01:05:38.334 --> 01:05:42.271
RESOURCES [inaudible] TO ADDRESS.

01:05:42.338 --> 01:05:42.571
SO -- WE'RE

01:05:42.638 --> 01:05:44.307
TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE THE

01:05:44.373 --> 01:05:46.208
TRANSFORM IF TRANSFORMATIVE

01:05:46.275 --> 01:05:47.910
CLIMATE COMMUNITIES THAT THAT

01:05:47.977 --> 01:05:49.512
DOES STRATEGIC LOWER GROWTH

01:05:49.578 --> 01:05:51.647
COUNCIL IS CURRENTLY IN CHARGE

01:05:51.714 --> 01:05:53.082
OF I NEED A LOT MORE MONEY TO

01:05:53.149 --> 01:05:55.885
SCALE THESE PROJECTS UP.

01:05:55.951 --> 01:05:56.752
PEOPLE ACTUALLY WANT TO PLAY

01:05:56.819 --> 01:05:58.587
AGAIN ALL THIS WORK THAT YOU SEE

01:05:58.654 --> 01:06:00.122
DOWN HERE THIS THIS IS THREE

01:06:00.189 --> 01:06:02.925
YEARS OF WORK. FOR FREE.

01:06:02.992 --> 01:06:03.526
NEIGHBORHOODS CAN AFFORD THIS

01:06:03.592 --> 01:06:06.228
KIND OF WORK.

01:06:06.295 --> 01:06:07.596
AND THAT IS THE ONLY WAY THESE

01:06:07.663 --> 01:06:09.298
MODELS BECOME COME TO THE

01:06:09.365 --> 01:06:11.233
SURFACE BECAUSE THE REALITY IS

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:12.835
IS THAT IF WE CAN'T PERCOLATE

01:06:12.902 --> 01:06:15.738
PROJECTS FROM BELOW.

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:17.940
WE CAN'T WRITE THE GRASS FUND.

01:06:18.007 --> 01:06:19.241
NOBODY FUNDS THEM BECAUSE THEY

01:06:19.308 --> 01:06:20.976
CAN'T SEE THE AND PLANNING IS

01:06:21.043 --> 01:06:24.246
THE KEY. TO THAT HAPPENING

01:06:24.313 --> 01:06:24.547
[inaudible]

01:06:24.613 --> 01:06:26.615
THANK YOU.

01:06:26.682 --> 01:06:28.184
ANY COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE

THANK YOU DOCTOR HERNANDEZ SOME.

01:06:32.955 --> 01:06:34.724
YOU KNOW ONE COMMUNITY IN MY

01:06:34.790 --> 01:06:36.092
DISTRICT JUST RECEIVE THE

01:06:36.158 --> 01:06:38.227
TRANSFORMING CLIMATE COMMUNITIES

01:06:38.294 --> 01:06:38.928
GRANT --

01:06:38.994 --> 01:06:41.564
PACOIMA WHICH IS WHERE I GREW UP --

01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:44.467
AND A LOT OF WHAT YOU PRESENTED --

01:06:44.533 --> 01:06:46.569
IT SEEMS LIKE WITH THE PLAN FOR

01:06:46.635 --> 01:06:48.738
THAT PROJECT IS SIMILAR --

01:06:48.804 --> 01:06:50.840
SO I'M VERY EXCITED TO SEE --

01:06:50.906 --> 01:06:53.576
YOUR PRESENTATION --

01:06:53.642 --> 01:06:56.112
AND BUT DO YOU THINK WITH PROP

01:06:56.178 --> 01:06:57.246
YOU KNOW MUNICIPALITIES DON'T

01:06:57.313 --> 01:06:59.482
HAVE THE RESOURCES TO PLAN.

01:06:59.548 --> 01:07:00.950
BUT I'M I'M HOPING THAT THESE

01:07:01.016 --> 01:07:02.618
PROJECTS THAT ARE BEING FUNDED

01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:04.987
CAN SERVE AS EXAMPLES AS AS A

01:07:05.054 --> 01:07:06.822
PLACE THAT YOU CAN GO AND SEE IT

01:07:06.889 --> 01:07:08.391
ONCE THESE PROJECTS ARE

01:07:08.457 --> 01:07:10.326
COMPLETED --

01:07:10.393 --> 01:07:12.561
AND THEN HIGHLIGHT THE NEED OF

01:07:12.628 --> 01:07:14.730
NEIGHBORHOOD SKILLS.

01:07:14.797 --> 01:07:16.732
YES -- AND

01:07:16.799 --> 01:07:17.366
ONE QUESTION I WOULD LIKE TO ASK

01:07:17.433 --> 01:07:19.668
YOU.

01:07:19.735 --> 01:07:21.437
HOW MANY NEIGHBORHOODS IN YOUR

01:07:21.504 --> 01:07:23.539
AREA WOULD BENEFIT FROM THAT

01:07:23.606 --> 01:07:25.274
TYPE OF GRANT?

01:07:25.341 --> 01:07:26.809
ALL OF THEM AND SO WILL WE CAN

01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:29.044
ONLY DO IT ONE NEIGHBORHOOD AT A

01:07:29.111 --> 01:07:30.713
TIME IN MORE DIFFERENT PARTS OF

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:33.149
THE STATE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO

01:07:33.215 --> 01:07:34.583
SCALE THIS URGENCY UP.

01:07:34.650 --> 01:07:36.652
WITHOUT THE RESOURCES TO REALLY

01:07:36.719 --> 01:07:39.255
ROLL OUT WHAT WE CALL CLIMATE

01:07:39.321 --> 01:07:41.056
CHANGE POLICY [inaudible]

01:07:41.123 --> 01:07:46.028
THANK YOU.

01:07:46.095 --> 01:07:47.997
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ON THANK

01:07:48.063 --> 01:07:48.664
YOU VERY MUCH --

01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:49.965
DOCTRINE AND IS FOR BEING HERE

01:07:50.032 --> 01:07:51.133
ARE YOU MISSION --

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:53.636
THAT WE SHOULD BRING TRANSIT TO

01:07:53.702 --> 01:07:56.071
HOUSING AND ALL AND THAT'S A

01:07:56.138 --> 01:07:57.873
VERY FASCINATING CONCEPT I AM

01:07:57.940 --> 01:07:59.575
JUST WONDERING UP.

01:07:59.642 --> 01:08:01.744
OCCASIONALLY WE SAY WE ARMED

01:08:01.811 --> 01:08:03.245
BUILT AROUND TRANSIT FOR EXAMPLE

01:08:03.312 --> 01:08:04.480
IS WHEN IT COMES TO AFFORDABLE

01:08:04.547 --> 01:08:06.248
HOUSING AND THE LIKE SO ARE WE

01:08:06.315 --> 01:08:07.983
HAVE BE WE'VE BEEN DOING IT

01:08:08.050 --> 01:08:08.284
BACKWARDS--

01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:12.354
OR IS THAT NOT THE CASE

01:08:12.421 --> 01:08:12.655
[inaudible]

01:08:12.721 --> 01:08:13.189
SO.

01:08:13.255 --> 01:08:15.925
WHAT WE DO IS WE LOOK AT WHERE

01:08:15.991 --> 01:08:17.593
TRANSIT IS LOCATED?

01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:19.728
N. HISTORICALLY TRANSIT IS NOT

01:08:19.795 --> 01:08:21.363
LOCATED IN DISADVANTAGED

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:22.431
COMMUNITIES.

01:08:22.498 --> 01:08:24.033
WHICH ELIMINATES THEM FROM ANY

01:08:24.099 --> 01:08:25.768
KIND OF TRANSITORY DEVELOPMENT

01:08:25.835 --> 01:08:26.769
FUND.

01:08:26.836 --> 01:08:28.771
WHICH MEANS WE SKEW WHERE THIS

01:08:28.838 --> 01:08:30.506
MONEY GO THIS AND IT DOESN'T

01:08:30.573 --> 01:08:32.775
TAKE CARE OF THE OBJECTIVES OF

01:08:32.842 --> 01:08:34.343
THE LEGISLATION WHICH IS SAYS.

01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:35.611
GET TO THE DACS GET TO THE

01:08:35.678 --> 01:08:36.946
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND

01:08:37.012 --> 01:08:38.848
IMPLEMENT THESE CLIMATE CHANGE

01:08:38.914 --> 01:08:39.782
TOLLS.

01:08:39.849 --> 01:08:40.916
BUT WHEN IT OPERATES ON THE

01:08:40.983 --> 01:08:43.052
GROUND.

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:45.588
WE HAVE THESE RULES THAT SAY YOU

01:08:45.654 --> 01:08:47.389
CAN ONLY DO THIS WHERE TRANSIT

01:08:47.456 --> 01:08:48.591
IS LOCATED.

01:08:48.657 --> 01:08:49.925
WHICH WIPES OUT MY NEIGHBORHOOD

01:08:49.992 --> 01:08:52.328
FROM THE PROCESS SO HOW DO WE

01:08:52.394 --> 01:08:54.830
GET MORE DISTRIBUTIVE TYPES OF

01:08:54.897 --> 01:08:56.265
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS THAT GO

01:08:56.332 --> 01:08:57.366
INTO THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND

01:08:57.433 --> 01:08:58.467
CIRCULATE WITH IN THE

01:08:58.534 --> 01:08:59.401
NEIGHBORHOODS.

01:08:59.468 --> 01:09:02.037
BECAUSE MOST OF OUR TRAVEL IS

01:09:02.104 --> 01:09:03.339
WITHIN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:09:03.405 --> 01:09:04.740
IN THIS I HAVE TO GO TO THE

01:09:04.807 --> 01:09:05.574
DOCTOR BECAUSE THERE'S NO

01:09:05.641 --> 01:09:07.009
HEALTHCARE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD I

01:09:07.076 --> 01:09:08.677
GOT TO GO TO A BIG BOX OUT IN

01:09:08.744 --> 01:09:10.946
ROCKLIN IN ANOTHER PLACE.

01:09:11.013 --> 01:09:14.750
SO BY HAVING THIS TYPE OF

01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:16.352
HOUSING.

01:09:16.418 --> 01:09:18.487
THAT IS SUPPORTED BY A MORE

01:09:18.554 --> 01:09:20.990
NIMBLE TYPE OF TRANSPORTATION.

01:09:21.056 --> 01:09:22.324
I CAN QUALIFY FOR TRANSIT

01:09:22.391 --> 01:09:24.193
ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT FUNDS AND

01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:25.861
GET THE HOUSING I NEED YOU MY

01:09:25.928 --> 01:09:27.830
COMPLETE STREETS PROJECT. TO

01:09:27.897 --> 01:09:29.698
MAKE THAT SYNCHRONICITY

01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:29.999
[inaudible]

01:09:30.065 --> 01:09:31.467
STREETS.

01:09:31.534 --> 01:09:33.702
HOUSING PEOPLE WALK WALK ABILITY

01:09:33.769 --> 01:09:35.037
EVERYTHING THAT WE WANT TO SEE

01:09:35.104 --> 01:09:36.272
THE DOWNTOWN EXPERIENCE THERE'S

01:09:36.338 --> 01:09:38.107
NO REASON YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT IN

01:09:38.173 --> 01:09:43.779
A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY.

01:09:43.846 --> 01:09:45.548
SOME REMEMBER RAMOS THANK YOU

01:09:45.614 --> 01:09:47.483
MADAM CHAIR ON THE THE SOLAR

01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:49.084
ASPECT OF IT AND INTO THE

01:09:49.151 --> 01:09:50.152
NEIGHBORHOODS AND DISTRIBUTED

01:09:50.219 --> 01:09:51.554
ENERGY HOW MUCH OF THAT WENT

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:53.455
BACK INTO THE LOCAL --

01:09:53.522 --> 01:09:55.724
COMMUNITY ITSELF AND DID THE END

01:09:55.791 --> 01:09:57.693
USERS IN THAT LOCAL COMMUNITY

01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:59.361
AND UP --

01:09:59.428 --> 01:10:00.996
BENEFITING FROM THAT COMING BACK

I AM VERY HAPPY YOU BROUGHT THIS

01:10:03.532 --> 01:10:06.902
QUESTION TEMAS TO THIS COMMITTEE.

01:10:06.969 --> 01:10:08.637
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE'RE HAVING

01:10:08.704 --> 01:10:10.139
IN ROLLING OUT THAT PROJECT.

01:10:10.205 --> 01:10:11.974
IS ACCESSING CAP AND TRADE

01:10:12.041 --> 01:10:13.409
DOLLARS.

01:10:13.475 --> 01:10:14.944
AS THE WAY CAP AND TRADE

01:10:15.010 --> 01:10:17.613
POLICIES ARE WRITTEN THEY'RE

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:19.014
WRITTEN.

01:10:19.081 --> 01:10:20.382
FOR ALMOST LIKE A SUBSIDY TO THE

01:10:20.449 --> 01:10:22.284
HOUSEHOLD WHENEVER WE PUT UP A

01:10:22.351 --> 01:10:25.421
SOLAR ARRAY.

01:10:25.487 --> 01:10:27.423
IT HAS TO RESULT IN A DIRECT

01:10:27.489 --> 01:10:29.391
REDUCTION AND HOUSEHOLD UTILITY

01:10:29.458 --> 01:10:31.393
COSTS.

01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:33.228
NOW WHEN THE UTILITY COMPANY TAX

01:10:33.295 --> 01:10:34.863
ON A THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR

01:10:34.930 --> 01:10:36.966
APPLICATION FEE FOR THOSE

01:10:37.032 --> 01:10:38.634
PARTIES WE WIPE OUT THE WE BY

01:10:38.701 --> 01:10:40.235
ABOUT THE SAVINGS.

01:10:40.302 --> 01:10:42.371
WHICH MEANS WE CANNOT PROVIDE

01:10:42.438 --> 01:10:43.672
THAT SERVICE.

01:10:43.739 --> 01:10:47.443
AND ALSO WHEN WE FOCUS ON THE

01:10:47.509 --> 01:10:49.211
RATHER THAN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:10:49.278 --> 01:10:51.747
THE GRASS DON'T ALLOW US TO

01:10:51.814 --> 01:10:53.315
AGGREGATE THE ENERGY

01:10:53.382 --> 01:10:55.618
[inaudible] TO SELL.

01:10:55.684 --> 01:10:58.053
BUT RATHER AS THE INTERNET WANT

01:10:58.120 --> 01:10:59.922
A SUBSIDY TO THE HOUSEHOLD SO

01:10:59.989 --> 01:11:01.924
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO BUILD THAT

01:11:01.991 --> 01:11:03.259
NEIGHBORHOOD INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:11:03.325 --> 01:11:04.660
AND THIS IS IMPORTANT THING THAT

01:11:04.727 --> 01:11:06.161
WE'RE GOING TO RIGHT NOW BECAUSE

01:11:06.228 --> 01:11:07.930
NOW I HAVE TO GO SEEK PRIVATE

01:11:07.997 --> 01:11:10.099
FINANCING FOR THIS.

01:11:10.165 --> 01:11:11.433
AT A HIGHER INTEREST RATE.

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:16.639
THAN WHAT I WAS BE GETTING FROM --

01:11:16.705 --> 01:11:17.172
THE STATE ON CAP AND TRADE

01:11:17.239 --> 01:11:18.173
DOLLARS.

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.275
SO EVEN THOUGH THE THE MODEL

01:11:20.342 --> 01:11:21.510
SEEMS TO BE WORKING YOU HAVE --

01:11:21.577 --> 01:11:23.512
SOLAR PANELS COMING UP TENSION

01:11:23.579 --> 01:11:25.247
WIRES OF I UNDERSTOOD IT

01:11:25.314 --> 01:11:26.715
CORRECTLY NOT YES THAT'S AT THAT

01:11:26.782 --> 01:11:28.283
THE MENTION THE PARKING LOT

01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:30.085
CANOPY WHO WERE AT THE COMMUNITY

01:11:30.152 --> 01:11:31.887
CENTER THAT WERE THE AND THE THE

01:11:31.954 --> 01:11:33.155
NEIGHBORHOOD GETTING THE

01:11:33.222 --> 01:11:34.456
DISTRIBUTIVE ENERGY STILL AS A

01:11:34.523 --> 01:11:35.457
COMPONENT THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:11:35.524 --> 01:11:36.692
WORKED ON SO THAT.

01:11:36.759 --> 01:11:38.494
THE END RESULT IS THERE IN THE

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:40.629
NAVY IS THERE THE IDEA NOW IS

01:11:40.696 --> 01:11:43.799
HOW DO WE CHANGE THIS DIALOGUE

01:11:43.866 --> 01:11:45.234
THAT EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN

01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:47.002
A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY HAS TO

01:11:47.069 --> 01:11:51.106
GO TO A HOUSEHOLD.

01:11:51.173 --> 01:11:51.940
RATHER THAN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:11:52.007 --> 01:11:52.775
THE LEGISLATION SAYS

01:11:52.841 --> 01:11:54.276
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY IT DOES

01:11:54.343 --> 01:11:56.745
NOT SAY DISADVANTAGED HOUSEHOLD.

01:11:56.812 --> 01:11:58.414
AND WHAT HAPPENS IS WE LOSE

01:11:58.480 --> 01:11:59.815
THESE INFRASTRUCTURE DOLLARS

01:11:59.882 --> 01:12:01.417
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO TURN THIS

01:12:01.483 --> 01:12:03.118
OVER AS A SUBSIDY TO THESE

01:12:03.185 --> 01:12:05.387
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND

01:12:05.454 --> 01:12:09.491
THAT'S DOING OF GREAT INJUSTICE.

01:12:09.558 --> 01:12:11.393
IF WE CAN TOUCH ON TRACKING

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:13.162
PROGRESS IN MEASURING WHAT

01:12:13.228 --> 01:12:16.131
MATTERS WHAT WOULD YOU SAY THAT

01:12:16.198 --> 01:12:17.666
WE SHOULD DO AS A STATE TO

01:12:17.733 --> 01:12:21.103
MODIFY EXISTING OR A DOT NEW.

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:23.305
METRICS THAT TRACK PROGRESS SAID

01:12:23.372 --> 01:12:26.408
IT ENCOURAGE UPWARD MOBILITY IN

01:12:26.475 --> 01:12:28.410
AN AN INCLUSIVE ECONOMY.

01:12:28.477 --> 01:12:29.278
IF IF THE STATE.

01:12:29.344 --> 01:12:31.080
WOULD LIKE.

01:12:31.146 --> 01:12:33.782
TO CHAU WHO ITS PROGRESS.

01:12:33.849 --> 01:12:35.617
WE REALLY NEED TOMORROW MARCH OR

01:12:35.684 --> 01:12:37.052
WHERE THE MONEY ACTUALLY CUTS

01:12:37.119 --> 01:12:39.021
HOW MUCH OF THIS CAP AND TRADE

01:12:39.088 --> 01:12:40.522
DOLLARS ACTUALLY HIT

01:12:40.589 --> 01:12:43.025
NEIGHBORHOODS.

01:12:43.092 --> 01:12:44.593
NOT JUST BECAUSE WE'RE DOING AN

01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:46.261
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT THAT

01:12:46.328 --> 01:12:48.330

ANOTHER BIG BOX.

01:12:57.539 --> 01:12:59.641

01:23:37.645 --> 01:23:39.581
WILL STAY IN THE FUTURE --

01:23:39.647 --> 01:23:41.249
EACH APPLICANT MUST DEVELOP AN

01:23:41.316 --> 01:23:42.751
ANTI DISPLACEMENT PLAN THAT

01:23:42.817 --> 01:23:44.152
OUTLINES POLICIES AND

01:23:44.219 --> 01:23:45.653
PROTECTIONS IN PLACE TO PREVENT

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:47.389
DISPLACEMENT OF RESIDENTS AND

01:23:47.455 --> 01:23:48.823
BUSINESSES --

01:23:48.890 --> 01:23:50.258
AND AGAIN WE WORK WITH EACH OF

01:23:50.325 --> 01:23:51.459
THEM --

01:23:51.526 --> 01:23:52.694
AROUND THAT.

01:23:52.761 --> 01:23:54.829
AND THEN FINALLY EACH --

01:23:54.896 --> 01:23:56.231
APPLICATION EACH PROJECT IS

01:23:56.297 --> 01:23:58.600
REQUIRED TO HAVE AT LEAST 50%

01:23:58.666 --> 01:24:00.502
LEVERAGE INVESTMENT --

01:24:00.568 --> 01:24:02.370
AND SO WE ASK FOR IT THAT IS

01:24:02.437 --> 01:24:05.106
TIED TO SPECIFIC PROJECTS IN THE

01:24:05.173 --> 01:24:07.208
PRIDE AND THE INVESTMENT AREA.

01:24:07.275 --> 01:24:08.543
SO FOR OUR FUTURE SKEWS ME

01:24:08.610 --> 01:24:09.644
THROUGH OUR FIRST TWO ROUNDS OF

01:24:09.711 --> 01:24:10.678
THE PROGRAM WE'VE INVEST

01:24:10.745 --> 01:24:12.781
INVESTED JUST OVER A HUNDRED AND

01:24:12.847 --> 01:24:13.915
SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS.

01:24:13.982 --> 01:24:15.750
IN THESE FIVE NEIGHBORHOODS BUT

01:24:15.817 --> 01:24:17.719
IF SEEN ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED AND

01:24:17.786 --> 01:24:18.620
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND

01:24:18.686 --> 01:24:20.455
LEVERAGE INVESTMENT THAT'S TIED

01:24:20.522 --> 01:24:22.490
TO OTHER PROJECTS IN WITH IN OUR

01:24:22.557 --> 01:24:23.992
PROJECT AREAS.

01:24:24.058 --> 01:24:25.827
ARE PROJECT AREA IS FOCUS AT A

01:24:25.894 --> 01:24:27.829
NEIGHBORHOOD SCALE SO AN AREA OF

01:24:27.896 --> 01:24:29.531
LESS THAN FIVE SQUARE MILES. TO

01:24:29.597 --> 01:24:32.066
REALLY ENSURE THAT YOU'RE SEEING

01:24:32.133 --> 01:24:35.637
THE SYNERGIES AND BY --

01:24:35.703 --> 01:24:36.805
JUST NOTED IN THE PREVIOUS

01:24:36.871 --> 01:24:38.773
PRESENTATION MANY OF THESE

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:40.708
COMMUNITIES ARE NOT COMPETITIVE --

01:24:40.775 --> 01:24:41.976
INTO AN EXISTING PROGRAMS THE

01:24:42.043 --> 01:24:42.777
THEY DON'T HAVETHE

01:24:42.844 --> 01:24:44.212
TRANSPORTATION AMENITIES ARE

01:24:44.279 --> 01:24:46.014
OTHER FACTORS THAT WOULD ALLOW

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:48.049
THEM TO ACCESS OTHER STATE FUNDS.

01:24:48.116 --> 01:24:49.951
SO IN MANY CASES THIS INITIAL

01:24:50.018 --> 01:24:51.786
INVESTMENT IS SETTING THEM UP TO

01:24:51.853 --> 01:24:53.621
BE MUCH MORE COMPETITIVE FOR

01:24:53.688 --> 01:24:55.323
FUTURE FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES.

01:24:55.390 --> 01:24:56.758
AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF THAT IS

01:24:56.825 --> 01:24:58.626
THE SACRAMENTO AWARD WE JUST

01:24:58.693 --> 01:24:59.194
MADE --

01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:00.361
WHERE WERE A LOT OF OUR

01:25:00.428 --> 01:25:01.830
INVESTMENTS GOING INTO THE DOES

01:25:01.896 --> 01:25:03.398
RIOS LIGHT RAIL STATION WHICH

01:25:03.465 --> 01:25:04.766
WILL MAKE THEM HAVE A HIGH

01:25:04.833 --> 01:25:06.267
QUALITY TRANSIT CONNECTION?

01:25:06.334 --> 01:25:07.402
THAT WILL MAKE THEM MORE

01:25:07.469 --> 01:25:10.839
COMPETITIVE FOR OTHER AWARDS --

01:25:10.905 --> 01:25:12.874
AND SO.

01:25:12.941 --> 01:25:15.076
THIS PROGRAM TO US IS REALLY ONE

01:25:15.143 --> 01:25:16.411
WE'VE WORKED VERY HARD AND WE

01:25:16.478 --> 01:25:17.645
WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH

01:25:17.712 --> 01:25:19.080
COMMUNITIES --

01:25:19.147 --> 01:25:20.782
AS I MENTIONED WE'VE DEVELOPED --

01:25:20.849 --> 01:25:22.484
WE ALSO PROVIDE PLANNING GRANTS

01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:24.552
WE'VE AWARDED.

01:25:24.619 --> 01:25:25.186
PLANNING GRANTS BETWEEN ABOUT A

01:25:25.253 --> 01:25:26.788
HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND TWO

01:25:26.855 --> 01:25:27.655
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO

01:25:27.722 --> 01:25:28.990
FOURTEEN COMMUNITIES --

01:25:29.057 --> 01:25:30.658
AND WE HAVE EXPANDED THAT TO BE

01:25:30.725 --> 01:25:32.393
NOT JUST THE TOP 5% OF MOST

01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:33.962
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES BUT IT

01:25:34.028 --> 01:25:34.629
ALSO.

01:25:34.696 --> 01:25:36.764
EXTENDS THE TOP 25% OF

01:25:36.831 --> 01:25:38.266
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES.

01:25:38.333 --> 01:25:39.801
AND THE INTENTION THERE IS THAT

01:25:39.868 --> 01:25:40.835
WE'RE CREATING A PIPELINE OF

01:25:40.902 --> 01:25:43.238
PROJECTS IN PROVIDING CAPACITY

01:25:43.304 --> 01:25:43.872
FOR THIS PLANNING TO HAPPEN ON

01:25:43.938 --> 01:25:44.973
THE GROUND --

01:25:45.039 --> 01:25:46.274
WITH HOPES THAT WITH AN

01:25:46.341 --> 01:25:48.042
ADDITIONAL FUNDING AVAILABILITY

01:25:48.109 --> 01:25:50.578
WE WILL BE ABLE TO SERVE MORE

01:25:50.645 --> 01:25:52.046
NEIGHBORHOODS ACROSS THE STATE --

01:25:52.113 --> 01:25:53.414
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE

THE ENERGY COMMISSION IS TRYING

01:26:38.927 --> 01:26:40.328
TO DO TWO THINGS THAT I THINK

01:26:40.395 --> 01:26:41.362

BROADLY.

01:26:44.032 --> 01:26:44.866

01:28:09.617 --> 01:28:10.585
NINETEEN SEVENTIES THE

01:28:10.652 --> 01:28:12.320

01:29:27.361 --> 01:29:28.563
REALLY FOCUS ON THAT STRATEGIC

01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:30.498
PLAN WE HAVE MEETINGS --

01:29:30.565 --> 01:29:32.066
OF OUR LEADERSHIP TEAM THE LAST

01:29:32.133 --> 01:29:33.768
FRIDAY OF EVERY MONTH SHE HOSTS

01:29:36.637 --> 01:29:37.739
WELL WHAT WE DON'T POORLY HOW

01:29:37.805 --> 01:29:39.173
CAN WE IMPROVE --

01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:40.341
SO IT'S IT'S REALLY BEEN A

01:29:40.408 --> 01:29:41.776
COMMITMENT FOR US. TO WANT TO

01:29:41.843 --> 01:29:43.010
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR TWO

01:29:43.077 --> 01:29:44.712
MAJOR PROGRAMS ONE IS CALLED

01:29:44.779 --> 01:29:46.647
EPIC AND THE OTHER ONE IS --

01:29:46.714 --> 01:29:48.015
IN SEARCH OF A BETTER NAME BUT

01:29:48.082 --> 01:29:49.283
IT'S CURRENTLY CALLED THE A. R.

01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:51.352
F. VTP THE ALTERNATIVE AND

01:29:51.419 --> 01:29:53.821
RENEWABLE VEHICLE --

01:29:53.888 --> 01:29:55.857
FUEL AND VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY

01:29:55.923 --> 01:29:57.492
PROGRAM.

01:29:57.558 --> 01:30:01.662
I WOULD HELP THE ONE EIGHTEEN

01:30:01.729 --> 01:30:02.296
PROGRAM BECAUSE AB TEAM WAS THE

01:30:02.363 --> 01:30:03.264
BILL THAT THAT IT'S DOLLARS PER

01:30:03.331 --> 01:30:07.034
YEAR --

01:30:07.101 --> 01:30:11.239
RESEARCH AND THE THE CALL THE

01:30:11.305 --> 01:30:11.873
EIGHTY ONE EIGHTEEN PROGRAM THE

01:30:11.939 --> 01:30:12.640
TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM INVEST

01:30:12.707 --> 01:30:13.775
ABOUT A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS

01:30:13.841 --> 01:30:15.743
PER YEAR IN CLEAN TRANSPORTATION

01:30:15.810 --> 01:30:17.145
PROJECTS.

01:30:17.211 --> 01:30:18.946
AND THE OUTREACH ACTIVITIES

01:30:19.013 --> 01:30:20.148
INCLUDE IT GET MEETING WITH

01:30:20.214 --> 01:30:21.315
COMMUNITY LEADERS PUBLIC

01:30:21.382 --> 01:30:23.251
WORKSHOPS WECREATED EASY TO

01:30:23.317 --> 01:30:24.318
READ MORE MULTI LINGUAL

01:30:24.385 --> 01:30:26.187
INFORMATIONAL MATERIALS AND

01:30:26.254 --> 01:30:28.422
WE'VE GOT A HOW TO APPLY FOR

01:30:28.489 --> 01:30:30.258
RESEARCH FUNDING VIDEO.

01:30:30.324 --> 01:30:30.892
AND WE BRING THESE THINGS OVER

01:30:30.958 --> 01:30:32.126
WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO SHARE

01:30:32.193 --> 01:30:33.761
BECAUSE SOME OF THE STUFF IS --

01:30:33.828 --> 01:30:34.695
IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN --

01:30:34.762 --> 01:30:36.063
AN APPLICANT --

01:30:36.130 --> 01:30:37.732
WHICH I HAVE ON THE OTHER SIDE

01:30:37.799 --> 01:30:38.733
TO FOR PUBLIC FUNDING IT'S NOT

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:40.134
ALWAYS THAT EASY TO NAVIGATE SO

01:30:40.201 --> 01:30:41.636
THE IDEA IS TO CREATE TOOLS THAT

01:30:41.702 --> 01:30:44.005
MAKE IT.

01:30:44.071 --> 01:30:45.673
NOT QUITE SO DAUNTING --

01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:46.674
THEN WE CONDUCT SURVEYS ON THE

01:30:46.741 --> 01:30:48.009
BACK AND THE TO SEE HOW WE'RE

01:30:48.075 --> 01:30:49.577
DOING SO GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF A

01:30:49.644 --> 01:30:51.345
RECENT SURVEY WE DID FOR FOR

01:30:51.412 --> 01:30:52.947
EPIC THE RESEARCH PIECE.

01:30:53.014 --> 01:30:54.182
AND WHAT WE LEARNED IN REACHING

01:30:54.248 --> 01:30:56.951
OUT TO FOLKS WAS THE 38% OF OUR

01:30:57.018 --> 01:30:58.085
EPIC AGREEMENTS INCLUDE WOMEN

01:30:58.152 --> 01:30:59.887
MINORITY DISABLED VETERAN OR

01:30:59.954 --> 01:31:01.155
LGBT OWNED.

01:31:01.222 --> 01:31:03.191
BUSINESSES AS HE THAT THE PRIME

01:31:03.257 --> 01:31:04.559
OR SUBCONTRACTOR.

01:31:04.625 --> 01:31:07.428
AND 55% OF THOSE SAME EPIC

01:31:07.495 --> 01:31:08.596
AGREEMENTS INCLUDE A SMALL

01:31:08.663 --> 01:31:12.567
BUSINESS OR IS A PRIME OR A

01:31:12.633 --> 01:31:14.702
SUBCONTRACTOR.

01:31:14.769 --> 01:31:15.937
THAT IS HOW IT ONE OTHER PROJECT

01:31:16.003 --> 01:31:17.872
THAT IS KIND OF A DIFFERENT AREA

01:31:17.939 --> 01:31:19.507
WERE WERE TRYING --

01:31:19.574 --> 01:31:20.708
TO IT.

01:31:20.775 --> 01:31:22.443
MAKE THESE --

01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:24.011
IN ROADS INTO INTO COMMUNITIES

01:31:24.078 --> 01:31:25.680
AND THAT IS CALLED KELSEY.

01:31:25.746 --> 01:31:27.215
AND THAT WAS A PART OF THIRTY

01:31:27.281 --> 01:31:28.249
MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM AGAIN

01:31:28.316 --> 01:31:30.651
THIS IS RESEARCH AND WHAT IT

01:31:30.718 --> 01:31:32.720
DOES IS PROVIDE SMALL GRANTS

01:31:32.787 --> 01:31:33.321
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:31:33.387 --> 01:31:36.824
MAX. TO TO SMALL ENTREPRENEURS

01:31:36.891 --> 01:31:38.659
THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT GIVEN

01:31:38.726 --> 01:31:39.760
MONEY THAT THAT IS VERY

01:31:39.827 --> 01:31:41.162
DIFFICULT TO COME BY AT AN EARLY

01:31:41.229 --> 01:31:43.731
STAGE BECAUSE THE V. SEASON THE

01:31:43.798 --> 01:31:44.632
PRIVATE EQUITIES AND AND

01:31:44.699 --> 01:31:45.967
TRADITIONAL BANKING.

01:31:46.033 --> 01:31:47.668
DON'T SEE THE THE VALUE IN IT

01:31:47.735 --> 01:31:49.403
AND IT'S IT'S HIGH RISK AND WE

01:31:49.470 --> 01:31:50.872
ACKNOWLEDGE THIS HIGH RISK WHEN

01:31:50.938 --> 01:31:51.706
WE DO IT BUT WE KEEP.

01:31:51.772 --> 01:31:53.407
THE WORD SMALL THEY DO WELL THEN

01:31:53.474 --> 01:31:55.176
THEY CAN GET FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY

01:31:55.243 --> 01:31:56.611
THOUSAND DOLLAR GRANTS TO REALLY

01:31:56.677 --> 01:31:57.912
TRY TO MOVE TO THE NEXT STAGE

01:31:57.979 --> 01:31:59.180
WITH CREDITS WHOLE ECOSYSTEM TO

01:31:59.247 --> 01:32:01.282
PROVIDE SUPPORT. TO THIS PROGRAM

01:32:01.349 --> 01:32:03.784
WE HAVE -- I

01:32:03.851 --> 01:32:04.318
CAN'T TELL YOU THE NUMBERS

01:32:04.385 --> 01:32:07.989
EXACTLY TO MORNING AND AND

01:32:08.055 --> 01:32:08.923
PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:11.058
FOLKS IS VERY EASY TO GET. TO TO

01:32:11.125 --> 01:32:12.526
THE APPLICATION PROCESS IT'S

01:32:12.593 --> 01:32:13.728
IT'S NOT LIKE SOME OF OUR LARGER

01:32:13.794 --> 01:32:15.496
AWARDS WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF

01:32:15.563 --> 01:32:17.064
LEG WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE --

01:32:17.131 --> 01:32:18.432
IN IN IT.

01:32:18.499 --> 01:32:19.967
THIS PARTICULAR SEE PROGRAM WE

01:32:20.034 --> 01:32:21.936
CALL CAL SEED IS WE SET A

01:32:22.003 --> 01:32:23.237
MINIMUM FUNDING TARGET FOR UNDER

01:32:23.304 --> 01:32:24.472
REPRESENTED GROUPS SUCH AS

MINORITY WOMEN IN LGBT ON

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:26.908
BUSINESSES.

01:32:26.974 --> 01:32:28.943
AND THAT'S THAT'S A REQUIREMENT

01:32:29.010 --> 01:32:30.044
THAT THE THE THE FOLKS WHO

01:32:30.111 --> 01:32:32.480
MANAGE THAT FUND LOOK FOR THOSE

01:32:32.546 --> 01:32:33.848
LOOK FOR THOSE TARGETS.

01:32:33.915 --> 01:32:36.317
SHIFTING TO THE AB ONE EIGHTEEN

01:32:36.384 --> 01:32:37.752
THE TRANSPORTATION FUND --

01:32:37.818 --> 01:32:41.856

FORCE ASPECT. TO DATE WE'VE

01:32:45.359 --> 01:32:47.295
INVESTED JUST SHY OF EIGHT

HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS

01:32:47.995 --> 01:32:49.096
PROGRAM --

01:32:49.163 --> 01:32:50.665
WITH A BROAD PORTFOLIO OF OF

01:32:50.731 --> 01:32:52.133
ACTIVITIES WE FOUGHT WE FROM THE

01:32:52.199 --> 01:32:54.402
INFRASTRUCTURE SO WE FUND --

01:32:54.468 --> 01:32:58.272
USAGI WAS STAFF WE'VE GOT ABOUT

01:32:58.339 --> 01:32:58.906
FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ZERO

CHINA'S ADDING ABOUT A MILLION A

01:33:04.345 --> 01:33:04.812
YEAR --

01:33:04.879 --> 01:33:06.414
LATELY SO WE'RE WE'RE DOING

01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:08.282
QUITE WELL IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE

01:33:08.349 --> 01:33:09.383
GOT OTHERS WE CAN LOOK TO IS A

01:33:09.450 --> 01:33:10.952
LOAD STAR FOR HOW.

01:33:11.018 --> 01:33:12.720
TO HOW TO REALLY SUCCEED IN THIS

01:33:12.787 --> 01:33:12.920
AREA.

01:33:12.987 --> 01:33:16.557
SO THOUSAND PUBLIC CHARGERS

01:33:16.624 --> 01:33:18.592

AND WE'VE GOT ABOUT THIRTY NINE

01:33:31.605 --> 01:33:33.007
HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS SO

01:33:33.074 --> 01:33:35.509
THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IS A PART OF

01:33:35.576 --> 01:33:36.978
WHAT WE FUND --

01:33:37.044 --> 01:33:40.247
IN IN ADDITION WE FUND BIOFUELS

ACTIVITIES BUT WITH ALL THIS

01:33:43.384 --> 01:33:45.386
THIS -- NEW

01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:47.021
YOU KNOW CHANGES IN THE WAY WE

01:33:47.088 --> 01:33:48.189
VIEW OURSELVES FROM PLACE TO

01:33:48.255 --> 01:33:49.991
PLACE WE NEED A SKILLED

01:33:50.057 --> 01:33:51.592
WORKFORCE TO HELP BUILD THIS

BILL THESE THINGS AND WRITE THE

01:33:54.462 --> 01:33:55.663
SOFTWARE AND ALL THE ALL THE

PARTS THAT GO WITH THAT.

01:33:56.998 --> 01:33:58.232
SO WE'VE INVESTED OF THAT AMOUNT

01:33:58.299 --> 01:34:00.067
I DESCRIBE THIRTY ONE MILLION

01:34:00.134 --> 01:34:02.536
DOLLARS SO FAR INTO --

01:34:02.603 --> 01:34:04.038
INTO THIS KIND OF TRAINING.

01:34:04.105 --> 01:34:06.474
AND WE ARE NOT EXPERTS IN THIS

01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:08.943
AREA SO WE RELY HEAVILY ON OUR

01:34:09.010 --> 01:34:10.344

BEEN TOUCHED ONE OF THESE WE DID

01:34:43.411 --> 01:34:45.212
IS WE FUNDED REGIONAL ENERGY WE

AND LASTLY I WOULD JUST MENTION

01:35:10.938 --> 01:35:13.140
A COUPLE THINGS ONE IS --

THE THE THE ECONOMICS ASSOCIATED

01:35:24.552 --> 01:35:26.754
WITH ELECTRONIC ELECTRIC BUSES

01:35:26.821 --> 01:35:29.256
VERSES DIESEL BUSES IS VERY

01:35:29.323 --> 01:35:31.225
FAVORABLE SO WE'VE GOT.

01:35:31.292 --> 01:35:32.960
THINK THREE WE GOT TO I THINK A

PLEASE TO HEAR.

01:48:22.462 --> 01:48:23.630
SO I WOULD JUST AT ABOUT SIX

01:48:23.697 --> 01:48:24.831
YEARS AGO WE CREATED AN E.

01:48:24.898 --> 01:48:26.633
FILING SYSTEM SO IT USED TO BE

01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:27.834
THAT WE GET LITERALLY BANKERS

01:48:27.901 --> 01:48:30.170
BOXES FULL OF APPLICATIONS

01:48:30.237 --> 01:48:31.504
BECAUSE WOULD REQUIRE THAT THAT

01:48:31.571 --> 01:48:33.473
YOU PROVIDE TEN COPIES OF THAT

01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:34.241

01:48:35.308 --> 01:48:38.445
AND WE GOT A FEW COMPLAINTS AND

01:48:38.511 --> 01:48:40.080
WE YOU KNOW PEOPLE SAY YOU KNOW

01:48:40.146 --> 01:48:41.081
IT'S A COST ME A THOUSAND

01:48:41.147 --> 01:48:42.249
DOLLARS JUST TO PRINT MAIL THE

01:48:42.315 --> 01:48:44.317

SEND WITH --

01:48:45.151 --> 01:48:47.254
PDF SO WE CHANGED AND NOW FOLKS

01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:50.390
CAN OF APPLY ELECTRONICALLY.

01:48:50.457 --> 01:48:51.191
FUNDAMENTAL AND THAT'S HELPED A

01:48:51.258 --> 01:48:52.626
LOT BUT FUNDAMENTALLY IT DOESN'T

01:48:52.692 --> 01:48:54.494
ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF OUR STUFF

01:48:54.561 --> 01:48:55.996
IS COMPLICATED SO IF YOU WANT TO

01:48:56.062 --> 01:48:58.632

YOU YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A REALLY

01:49:05.739 --> 01:49:07.173
HIGH DEGREE OF SOPHISTICATION SO

01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:10.911
WHAT WE'VE TRIED TO DO THERE IS

01:49:10.977 --> 01:49:12.679
MUCH MORE.

01:49:12.746 --> 01:49:13.780

01:49:28.028 --> 01:49:29.262
BUT TO REALLY SUBMIT A PACKAGE

01:49:29.329 --> 01:49:30.330
IT'S GOT A CHANCE OF WINNING IN

01:49:30.397 --> 01:49:31.965

01:49:32.032 --> 01:49:33.633

02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:21.674
WITH THEM.

02:01:21.741 --> 02:01:23.409
AND I DIDN'T SAY THEY DANCED

02:01:23.476 --> 02:01:24.844
AROUND THAT BUT THEY DON'T HAVE

02:01:24.910 --> 02:01:25.978
THE SOLUTIONS YET SO AS AN

02:01:26.045 --> 02:01:28.014
EXAMPLE WE PARTNERED WITH THE

02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:28.781
CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE

02:01:28.848 --> 02:01:29.448
SYSTEM.

02:01:29.515 --> 02:01:31.183
A HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN COLLEGES

02:01:31.250 --> 02:01:33.185
WE CREATED A PLATFORM CALLED

02:01:33.252 --> 02:01:35.121
CONTRACT READINESS AND CONTRACT

02:01:35.187 --> 02:01:36.722
RAINY IS IS BASICALLY AN ONLINE

02:01:36.789 --> 02:01:38.591
PLATFORM WE CAN GO GET A

02:01:38.658 --> 02:01:40.026
CERTIFICATE áP TV.

02:01:40.092 --> 02:01:42.828
AFTER YOU'VE --

02:01:42.895 --> 02:01:46.332
TAKEN THE COURT INDUCTION TO

02:01:46.399 --> 02:01:47.199
CERTIFICATION BECAUSE MANY OF

02:01:47.266 --> 02:01:50.036
OUR PARTICULAR MINORITY FIRMS.

02:01:50.102 --> 02:01:51.370
DON'T EVEN KNOW WITH THE FRONT

02:01:51.437 --> 02:01:54.273
DOOR IS AND SO I I SIT ON ALL

02:01:54.340 --> 02:01:55.307
THE COUNCIL'S THEY TALKED ABOUT

02:01:55.374 --> 02:01:56.676
ICE ON THE DIVERSITY COUNCIL FOR

02:01:56.742 --> 02:01:57.943
THE PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION

02:01:58.010 --> 02:01:59.478
LISTEN ON CALTRANS.

02:01:59.545 --> 02:02:01.380
ICE NINETY GS.

02:02:01.447 --> 02:02:03.249
I SALUTE ALL OF THEM RIGHT THE

02:02:03.315 --> 02:02:05.751
PROBLEM IS IS THAT THOSE FRONT

02:02:05.818 --> 02:02:08.487
DOORS A VERY DIFFICULT TO WALK

02:02:08.554 --> 02:02:09.321
THROUGH.

02:02:09.388 --> 02:02:11.924
SO INTENTIONAL STRATEGIES ABOUT

02:02:11.991 --> 02:02:13.592
WE HOW WE CREATE PATHWAYS FOR

02:02:13.659 --> 02:02:14.994
THOSE FRONT DOORS TO BE OPENED

02:02:15.061 --> 02:02:16.462
SOMETHING AS SIMPLE.

02:02:16.529 --> 02:02:17.463
AS AN AS MEANINGFUL AS A

02:02:17.530 --> 02:02:18.931
TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM I THINK

02:02:18.998 --> 02:02:20.232
WOULD GO FAR RIGHT BECAUSE

02:02:20.299 --> 02:02:21.767
THAT'S AN INTRODUCTION RIGHT.

02:02:21.834 --> 02:02:23.569
SO YOU'VE GOT TO ONE COMPANIES

02:02:23.636 --> 02:02:24.737
THAT HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE

02:02:24.804 --> 02:02:25.771
THREE DEPEND HOW YOU LOOK AT IT

02:02:25.838 --> 02:02:27.039
HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO EVEN GET

02:02:27.106 --> 02:02:28.174
THEIR FOOT IN THE DOOR.

02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:29.508
THEN YOU'VE GOT COMPANIES THAT

02:02:29.575 --> 02:02:31.110
ACTUALLY GROWN TO THE SYSTEM AND

02:02:31.177 --> 02:02:32.645
THEY'RE STILL NOT ABLE TO BECOME

02:02:32.712 --> 02:02:33.879
A PRIME.

02:02:33.946 --> 02:02:35.448
RIGHT AND THERE'S A LOT OF AREAS

SIGNIFICANT SHIFT ON THEIR PART

02:05:42.968 --> 02:05:45.504
IN RECENT YEARS. TO WORK WITH

POPULATIONS DEAL WITH EXTREME

02:06:05.925 --> 02:06:06.992
HEAT -- BUT

02:06:07.059 --> 02:06:07.793
WE HAVE A NUMBER OF OTHER TOOLS

02:06:07.860 --> 02:06:08.327
I WANTED TO BRING TO YOUR

02:06:08.394 --> 02:06:10.362
ATTENTION ONE IS WHAT WAS

02:06:10.429 --> 02:06:11.964
MENTIONED EARLIER AS CAL SEAT

02:06:12.031 --> 02:06:13.599
AND CYCLOTRON ROAD.

02:06:13.666 --> 02:06:14.733
IS A PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE

02:06:14.800 --> 02:06:16.769
CREATED THAT ESSENTIALLY ALLOWS

02:06:16.835 --> 02:06:18.103
YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS TO TACKLE

02:06:18.170 --> 02:06:20.406
VERY DIFFICULT PROBLEMS --

02:06:20.472 --> 02:06:22.074
IN THE MATERIAL SCIENCE AND

02:06:22.141 --> 02:06:25.044
OTHER HARD SCIENCE FIELDS SO FOR

02:06:25.110 --> 02:06:26.879
EXAMPLE IF YOU WANT TO DEVELOP A

02:06:26.946 --> 02:06:29.481
MEMBRANE THAT IS MUCH DOES A

02:06:29.548 --> 02:06:30.983
MUCH BETTER JOB OF SEPARATING.

02:06:31.050 --> 02:06:33.052
SALTS IN WATERS OF THE COMPUTER

02:06:33.118 --> 02:06:34.987
FIREWATER OR YOU WANT TO DEVELOP

02:06:35.054 --> 02:06:36.822
A NEW MATERIAL THAT WORKS AS A

02:06:36.889 --> 02:06:39.024
BETTER LITHIUM ION BATTERY OR

02:06:39.091 --> 02:06:41.327
SOMETHING THAT GOES BEYOND

02:06:41.393 --> 02:06:41.894
LITHIUM ION.

02:06:41.961 --> 02:06:43.929
THESE ARE HARD SCIENCE QUESTIONS

02:06:43.996 --> 02:06:45.497
AND WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE AND

02:06:45.564 --> 02:06:46.932
WORK WITH YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT

NOT ONLY DO IS DOES CALIFORNIA

02:06:48.867 --> 02:06:50.502
DEVELOP AND RESEARCH THESE BUT

02:06:50.569 --> 02:06:51.370
THAT AS WE THINK ABOUT

02:06:51.437 --> 02:06:53.205
MANUFACTURING THERE ARE

02:06:53.272 --> 02:06:54.673
OPPORTUNITIES TO DO THAT.

02:06:54.740 --> 02:06:57.309
HERE IN THE STATE I WOULD ALSO

02:06:57.376 --> 02:06:59.211
CALL OUT BIOSCIENCES --

02:06:59.278 --> 02:07:01.580
THE CURRENT MODEL IN BIOSCIENCES

02:07:01.647 --> 02:07:04.149
TAKE A MICROBE YOU FEED IT SUGAR

02:07:04.216 --> 02:07:06.618
AND YOU GOT A CANCER CURE OR

02:07:06.685 --> 02:07:09.321
LIKE ABBAS DINNER HERCEPTIN OR

02:07:09.388 --> 02:07:10.789
YOU GET A NEW MATERIAL.

02:07:10.856 --> 02:07:12.458
THE HARD CHALLENGE THAT WE ARE

02:07:12.524 --> 02:07:15.894
DEALING WITH OF A BY A RESOURCES

02:07:15.961 --> 02:07:18.063
ECONOMY SUMMIT WE CO HOSTED WITH

02:07:18.130 --> 02:07:19.365
THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD A FEW

02:07:19.431 --> 02:07:20.632
WEEKS AGO.

02:07:20.699 --> 02:07:21.900
IS HOW DO YOU TAKE FOREST'S

02:07:21.967 --> 02:07:24.436
WASTE AGRICULTURAL WASTES AND

02:07:24.503 --> 02:07:25.771
BREAK THOSE DOWN TURN THOSE INTO

02:07:25.838 --> 02:07:27.740
FEED STOCKS THAT A MICROBE CAN

02:07:27.806 --> 02:07:29.408
DIGESTING GIVE YOU AT NEW

02:07:29.475 --> 02:07:31.043
CHEMICAL OR NEW PLASTIC OR

02:07:31.110 --> 02:07:32.044
SOMETHING IT REPLACES A

02:07:32.111 --> 02:07:33.345
PETROLEUM BASED.

02:07:33.412 --> 02:07:36.248
OPPORTUNITIES SO WE THINK

02:07:36.315 --> 02:07:36.815
THEY'RE MAJOR OPPORTUNITIES

02:07:36.882 --> 02:07:37.449
THERE.

02:07:37.516 --> 02:07:38.784
AND THEN I WOULD ALSO A
