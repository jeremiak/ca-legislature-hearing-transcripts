DIFFERENT SCHEDULES. THAT MIGHT

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:26.712
BE A BETTER APPROACH- BUT

00:17:26.779 --> 00:17:29.114
OBVIOUSLY I HAVE NOT DISCUSSED

00:17:29.181 --> 00:17:30.516
THAT WITH THE CHAIR SO I'M

00:17:30.582 --> 00:17:32.050

00:17:51.703 --> 00:17:53.772
PLAN THIS COULD BE ADOPTED IN IN

00:17:53.839 --> 00:17:54.706
EIGHTEEN MONTHS SO THEY WOULD

00:17:54.773 --> 00:17:56.175
SELL FOOD YOU'RE GETTING RID OF

00:17:56.241 --> 00:17:58.243
THOSE PRIVATE RIGHT AFFECTIONS I

00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:59.111

IT YOU YOUR COST OF ACTION IS

00:18:04.783 --> 00:18:07.553
CREATED BY THE LACK OF.

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:13.525
POINT OF IT WAS WE WANT TO. FOR

00:18:13.592 --> 00:18:15.194
CITIES TO ADOPT THE PLOT AND WE

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.762
WANT TO GIVE THEM THE RESOURCES

TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABILITY.

00:18:22.601 --> 00:18:24.169
ACCOUNTABLE AND SO TRYING TO

00:18:24.236 --> 00:18:26.738

BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY. IS

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:13.552
IT'S THE STATE'S INTEREST. TO GO

00:24:13.618 --> 00:24:16.454
AND MICROMANAGE TRANSPORTATION

00:24:16.521 --> 00:24:19.457
PLANTS IN CITIES AND COUNTIES IN

00:24:19.524 --> 00:24:22.627
SHOULD WE BE USING OUR

00:24:22.694 --> 00:24:24.429
TRANSPORTATION DOLLARS TO BE

LIKE SAYING SHE IS IT THE

00:24:39.244 --> 00:24:40.679
STATE'S RESPONSE RESPONSIBILITY

00:24:40.745 --> 00:24:43.048
TO CREATE. A BIKE NETWORK I MEAN

00:24:43.114 --> 00:24:44.783
YOU SEE ME A BUS NETWORK OR

BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T HAVE MONEY

00:25:31.796 --> 00:25:32.797
TO COMPLETE THE PLAN. AND IN IT

00:25:32.864 --> 00:25:34.966

IMPLEMENT THE PLAN- INTERCOURSE

00:26:57.515 --> 00:26:59.584
AS WE HAVE HEARD WE'VE ALL KNOWN

00:26:59.651 --> 00:27:01.486
THAT. THERE ARE SOME CITIES THAT

00:27:01.553 --> 00:27:02.921
TAKE TEN YEARS FIFTEEN YEARS

00:27:02.988 --> 00:27:04.923
EVEN TWENTY YEARS. TO UPDATE

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:06.758
THEIR PLANS IN SOME CASES- I

00:27:06.825 --> 00:27:08.460
DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE EVEN

00:27:08.526 --> 00:27:09.494
FORESEE WHEN THAT THEY'RE GOING

00:27:09.561 --> 00:27:12.130
TO DO IT. BUT NOW IT'LL BE A

00:27:12.197 --> 00:27:14.366
VIOLATION OF LAW. IS THAT

00:27:14.432 --> 00:27:16.034
CORRECT. THEY WILL PUT THEM

00:27:16.101 --> 00:27:18.303
RESPONSIBLE IF THEY IF THEY AYE

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:20.972
IF THEY ADOPT A PLAN IDENTIFY

00:27:21.039 --> 00:27:23.108
THE PROBLEMS AND THEN FAIL TO

00:27:23.174 --> 00:27:25.043
ACT THEN THEY WILL BE

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:27.379
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS

00:27:27.445 --> 00:27:28.580
TAKEN AGAINST THEM BUT AGAIN

00:27:28.646 --> 00:27:32.217
THAT'S IMPORTANT. THEY HAVE TO

00:27:32.283 --> 00:27:34.753
CREATE THE PLAN. IMPLEMENT THE

00:27:34.819 --> 00:27:38.056
AND NOT SOLVE A PROBLEM SO

00:27:38.123 --> 00:27:39.758
THEY'VE GOT TO UPGRADE THEIR

00:27:39.824 --> 00:27:42.460
THEIR- GENERAL PLAN TO INCLUDE

00:27:42.527 --> 00:27:44.596
THE BIKES BICYCLE PATHS AND SO

00:27:44.662 --> 00:27:48.933
ON. BUT WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.001
BE GUARANTEED THEY'RE GOING TO

00:27:50.068 --> 00:27:51.436
GET THE MONEY. TO IMPLEMENT SOME

00:27:51.503 --> 00:27:54.339
INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES AND LESS

00:27:54.406 --> 00:27:57.842
THEY FEEL THAT IT WILL CALM AND

00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:59.511
YOU KNOW FIVE YEARS FROM NOW

00:27:59.577 --> 00:28:01.679
WHATEVER IT IS TWO YEARS FROM

00:28:01.746 --> 00:28:04.949
NOW. THANKS MY CHANGE AND WE

00:28:05.016 --> 00:28:05.717
DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO GIVE.

00:28:05.784 --> 00:28:07.052
THEY'RE STILL IN VIOLATION SO

00:28:07.118 --> 00:28:09.320
TWO THINGS A OBVIOUSLY I'M

00:28:09.387 --> 00:28:11.189
TRYING TO. USE THIS

00:28:11.256 --> 00:28:14.626
UNPRECEDENTED BUDGET SURPLUS TO

00:28:14.692 --> 00:28:16.795
HELP IMPLEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE

00:28:16.861 --> 00:28:18.897
IMPROVEMENTS B. WERE ALSO TRYING

00:28:18.963 --> 00:28:20.799
TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS A

00:28:20.865 --> 00:28:22.033
PRIORITY FOR THOSE CITIES. AND

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:24.536
YOU KNOW IN OUR AREA WHEN DOES

00:28:24.602 --> 00:28:26.104
THE MORE RIDE BIKE TO MORE

00:28:26.171 --> 00:28:27.772
COMMUNITIES I GO THROUGH ONE

00:28:27.839 --> 00:28:29.007
CITY THAT'S DONE A GREAT JOB AND

00:28:29.074 --> 00:28:30.942
I'M I'M GONNA GIVE A SHOUT OUT

00:28:31.009 --> 00:28:32.510
TO ARCADIA I DON'T REPRESENT

00:28:32.577 --> 00:28:34.779
ARCADIA BUT I WAS RIDING THROUGH

00:28:34.846 --> 00:28:36.681
ARCADIA. LAST MONTH AND THEY'VE

00:28:36.748 --> 00:28:37.882
USED THEIR RESOURCES AND AN

00:28:37.949 --> 00:28:41.886
ENTIRE CITY WIDE BIKE. PLAN

00:28:41.953 --> 00:28:43.755
THAT'S YOU KNOW. RIFIC NOW THERE

00:28:43.822 --> 00:28:45.290
ARE ADJACENT COMMUNITIES THAT

00:28:45.356 --> 00:28:47.158
AREN'T AS GOOD. THE WHOLE POINT

00:28:47.225 --> 00:28:48.893
OF THIS IS TO NOT HAVE THOSE

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.829
PLANS SIT ON THE SHELF. MANY

00:28:50.895 --> 00:28:53.531
CITIES AGAIN MY CITY HAS A SEVEN

00:28:53.598 --> 00:28:56.134
YEAR. RESURFACING PROGRAM THEY

00:28:56.201 --> 00:28:58.103
PRIORITIZE MAKING SURE THE

00:28:58.169 --> 00:29:00.171
STREETS ARE WELL PAVED AND SO

00:29:00.238 --> 00:29:01.973
THEY'VE SPLIT THE CITY INTO

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.708
SEVEN SECTIONS AND OVER A SEVEN

00:29:03.775 --> 00:29:06.077
YEAR PERIOD EVERY SECTION GETS.

00:29:06.144 --> 00:29:08.079
NEW SLURRY IN NEWCASTLE I MEAN

00:29:08.146 --> 00:29:09.347
THEY'VE MADE IT UP ALREADY SO

00:29:09.414 --> 00:29:10.648
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS MAKE

00:29:10.715 --> 00:29:12.550
CITIES UNDERSTAND THAT AS WE

00:29:12.617 --> 00:29:14.419
MOVE INTO THE- MODERN TIMES AND

00:29:14.486 --> 00:29:16.121
MORE MORE PEOPLE ARE. TRADING IN

00:29:16.187 --> 00:29:17.589
THEIR CARS ON EBAY LIKES AND

00:29:17.655 --> 00:29:20.391
MORE MORE PEOPLE ARE WALKING AND

00:29:20.458 --> 00:29:21.759
MORE MORE PEOPLE ARE WORKING

00:29:21.826 --> 00:29:22.694
FROM HOME YOU KNOW WE SAW THAT

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:25.630
FOR THE- BACK. GOING ON THAT

00:29:25.697 --> 00:29:28.500
WALK. JOB PATTERNS PEOPLE

00:29:28.566 --> 00:29:30.668
PATTERNS HAVE CHANGED. AND OUR

00:29:30.735 --> 00:29:33.771
PRIORITIES NEED TO CHANGE- WE

00:29:33.838 --> 00:29:35.773
WERE BEEN A CAR ROAD CULTURE FOR

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.243
A HUNDRED YEARS. WE NEED TO. BE

00:29:38.309 --> 00:29:40.311
THINKING ABOUTALTERNATIVE MODES

00:29:40.378 --> 00:29:41.546
OF TRANSPORTATION AS WE BECOME

00:29:41.613 --> 00:29:43.214
MORE CLIMATE FRIENDLY AND MORE

00:29:43.281 --> 00:29:44.716
PEDESTRIAN FRIENDLY AND MORE

00:29:44.782 --> 00:29:47.018
LOCALLY. ORIENTED IN OUR

00:29:47.085 --> 00:29:48.586
COMMUTER PATTERNS AND SO IT'S A

00:29:48.653 --> 00:29:50.255
COMBINATION OF LOCAL RESOURCES

00:29:50.321 --> 00:29:52.023
AND PRIORITIES AND THEN THE

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:55.560
STATE OFFICE STEPPING UP WITH

00:29:55.627 --> 00:29:58.763
THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LEGAL

00:29:58.830 --> 00:29:59.764

ON WHAT. WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH

00:55:42.172 --> 00:55:43.106
THE WITH THE PEOPLE THAT BUILT

00:55:43.173 --> 00:55:43.873
THE ROAD IN. WELL THE COMPANY

00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:46.409
THAT BUILT THE ROAD THE LOSERS

00:55:46.476 --> 00:55:47.510
WERE THE INVESTORS RIGHT THEY

00:55:47.577 --> 00:55:48.111
INVESTED SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION

00:55:48.178 --> 00:55:49.679
HOPING THAT THEY COULD- GET A

00:55:49.746 --> 00:55:51.414
PROFIT OF THIS THEY COMPLETELY

00:55:51.481 --> 00:55:53.850
WENT OUT OF BUSINESS- THEY SOLD.

00:55:53.917 --> 00:55:55.585
THEY PUT THE TOLL ROAD UP FOR

00:55:55.652 --> 00:55:57.554
SALE THERE WERE NO TAKERS SO-

00:55:57.620 --> 00:55:59.522
SANDAG WHICH IS THE PLANNING

00:55:59.589 --> 00:56:01.324
ORGANIZATION MATHS AND YOU'LL

00:56:01.391 --> 00:56:03.526
FIND A WAY. TO PURCHASE SAID

00:56:03.593 --> 00:56:05.295
THEY'VE BEEN OPERATING AT. AND

00:56:05.361 --> 00:56:07.497
INITIALLY IT THE GOAL IS ALWAYS

00:56:07.564 --> 00:56:08.798
TO MAKE IT EVEN WHEN IT WAS

00:56:08.865 --> 00:56:10.533
BUILT ORIGINALLY THE IDEA WAS

00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:11.668
THAT EVENTUALLY WOULD BECOME A

00:56:11.735 --> 00:56:14.204
PUBLIC HIGHWAY. SANDAG ONLY MADE

00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:16.372
POSSIBLE THAT THAT COULD HAPPEN

00:56:16.439 --> 00:56:17.741
SOONER. THERE IS A BOND THAT

00:56:17.807 --> 00:56:20.744
THEY RAISED THAT WITHOUT BOND-

00:56:20.810 --> 00:56:22.946
IT IT HAS CERTAIN IMPROVEMENTS

00:56:23.012 --> 00:56:24.214
WILL NEED TO BE MADE INTO THE

00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:25.882
OFF HIGHWAY GOING FORWARD THAT

00:56:25.949 --> 00:56:27.617
IS ALREADY FOR THE MONETARY

00:56:27.684 --> 00:56:28.785
BUDGET IT. IT'S ALREADY THERE

00:56:28.852 --> 00:56:31.221
MONIES THERE. IT ALSO INCLUDES

00:56:31.287 --> 00:56:33.623
MONEY FOR MAINTENANCE. SO TO THE

00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:35.925
EXTENT THAT THE STATE COULD COME

00:56:35.992 --> 00:56:36.793
AND LOOK AT HOW THEY CAN

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:41.598
SUPPORT. EITHER UP. CLOSE- SHE-

00:56:41.664 --> 00:56:43.600
THE PERIOD OF CLOSURE COULD COME

00:56:43.666 --> 00:56:45.668
ON COME ON LINE A LOT SOONER IS

00:56:45.735 --> 00:56:47.804
A FREE AYE WAY. OR AT LEAST HELP

00:56:47.871 --> 00:56:49.806
IN A WAY TO SUPPORT. REDUCING

00:56:49.873 --> 00:56:51.674
TOLLS SO THAT MORE PEOPLE CAN

00:56:51.741 --> 00:56:54.144
AFFORD TO USE IT- ANYTHING LIKE

00:56:54.210 --> 00:56:55.879
THAT WOULD WOULD BE A WIN IN

00:56:55.945 --> 00:56:57.647
TERMS OF THIS REGARD TO THIS

00:56:57.714 --> 00:57:00.116
BILL LEAVES IT. OPEN SO THAT

00:57:00.183 --> 00:57:01.818
THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED AS THOSE

00:57:01.885 --> 00:57:03.253
OF THIS BILL WILL NOT

00:57:03.319 --> 00:57:05.622
AUTOMATICALLY. ATTACH A

00:57:05.688 --> 00:57:07.791
TRANSLATE INTO THAT BUT IT IT

00:57:07.857 --> 00:57:10.960
WILL. HOPEFULLY BREAK MAKE THIS

00:57:11.027 --> 00:57:13.563
A PRIORITY FOR THE STATE. AND

00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:15.932
IN. THAT IN A WAY THAT WON'T

00:57:15.999 --> 00:57:18.334
DISRUPT. THE COUNTIES AND

00:57:18.401 --> 00:57:21.471
CONTINUED INVESTMENTS INTO THEIR

00:57:21.538 --> 00:57:23.039
TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURES.

00:57:23.106 --> 00:57:25.074
ONE MORE QUESTION SO THROUGH WAS

00:57:25.141 --> 00:57:26.042
AT SANDAG THAT FLOATED THE BONDS

00:57:26.109 --> 00:57:29.579
AND FOR THE YES TOOL YES OKAY.

00:57:29.646 --> 00:57:32.081
AND THE STATE WON'T BE ON THE

00:57:32.148 --> 00:57:34.117
HOOK FOR THAT NOT. I MEAN THE

00:57:34.184 --> 00:57:37.153
IDEA IS THAT THE STATE COULD-

00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:39.856
REYES EITHER SOME FUNDS TO PAY

00:57:39.923 --> 00:57:43.326
INTO THAT OR- PAY INTO KIND OF

00:57:43.393 --> 00:57:45.395
REDO HELPING TO REDUCE THE BOND

00:57:45.461 --> 00:57:47.664
OR EVEN PAY OFF THE BOND. ABOUT

00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:49.199
CURRENTLY IS STILL A TOLL ROAD

00:57:49.265 --> 00:57:50.834
YOU HAVE TO PAY TO BE ON IT'S A

00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:52.702
TOLL ROAD AND LIKE S. AS

00:57:52.769 --> 00:57:54.204
MENTIONED IT'S REALLY NOT

00:57:54.270 --> 00:57:57.640
PERFORMING. TO ITS INTENDED.

00:57:57.707 --> 00:57:59.475
GOALS THAT'S UNDERPERFORMING IF

00:57:59.542 --> 00:58:01.678
IT IF THIS I MEAN FOR THE MATCH

00:58:01.744 --> 00:58:03.646
IN THE VALLEY OF THE STATE THE

00:58:03.713 --> 00:58:05.582
STATE DIDN'T HAVE TO INVEST

00:58:05.648 --> 00:58:06.850
SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION IN

00:58:06.916 --> 00:58:08.251
BUILDING A HIGHWAY THAT WAS

00:58:08.318 --> 00:58:10.153
ALREADY WITHIN THE STATE'S.

00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:12.989
RESPONSIBILITIES AND I MEAN THE

00:58:13.056 --> 00:58:14.624
FACT THAT THEY WENT TO PRIVATE

00:58:14.691 --> 00:58:16.426
ROUTE JUST BASICALLY REDUCE THE

00:58:16.492 --> 00:58:17.894
COST BY HALF AND NOW E'RE

00:58:17.961 --> 00:58:20.930
LOOKING AT. NOW THE COST BEING

00:58:20.997 --> 00:58:24.968
HALF OF THE HALF AND SO. WE'RE

00:58:25.034 --> 00:58:28.137
EXPLORING. THE POSSIBILITY. THE

00:58:28.204 --> 00:58:29.772
STATE FINALLY MAKING TRUE TO HIS

00:58:29.839 --> 00:58:34.244
PROMISES AND- OPERATING THIS AS

00:58:34.310 --> 00:58:37.113
INITIALLY INTENDED. GREAT THANK

00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:40.083

LITTLE CONFUSED WE HAVE A NUMBER

00:58:45.889 --> 00:58:48.124
OF TOLL ROADS IN ORANGE COUNTY

00:58:48.191 --> 00:58:48.892
AS YOU'RE AWARE AND IT'S ALWAYS

00:58:48.958 --> 00:58:51.594
ABOUT TO THE COST OF TOOLS GOING

00:58:51.661 --> 00:58:52.195
UP TO ACTUALLY MEET THE BOND

00:58:52.262 --> 00:58:53.796
DEBT REQUIREMENTS IN THS

00:58:53.863 --> 00:58:55.798
SPECIFICALLY SAYS THAT THE BOND

00:58:55.865 --> 00:58:57.767
IT WILL BE A HUNDRED AND FORTY

00:58:57.834 --> 00:58:59.402
THREE POINT THREE MILLION

00:58:59.469 --> 00:59:01.504
DOLLARS- AS OF THAT DATE. IT

00:59:01.571 --> 00:59:03.239
DOES NOT HAVE PROJECTED THEY

00:59:03.306 --> 00:59:04.607
WOULD HAVE THE FUNDS AVAILABLE

00:59:04.674 --> 00:59:06.843
TO RETIRED THE BOND OUT AT THAT

00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:08.778
TIME SO TOOLS WOULD HAVE TO

00:59:08.845 --> 00:59:11.281
CONTINUE TO PAY OFF THE BOND

00:59:11.347 --> 00:59:12.682
DEBT OR THERE MIGHT BE ASSUME BY

00:59:12.749 --> 00:59:14.717
THE STATE TO PAY THAT OFF AND

00:59:14.784 --> 00:59:15.985
THOSE WOULD BE TAXPAYER DOLLARS

00:59:16.052 --> 00:59:16.853
CRAMPED. BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA

00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:19.055
TAKE THE TOLLS ARE WHICH IS THE

00:59:19.122 --> 00:59:22.992
PURPOSE OF THE BILL TO ENCOURAGE

00:59:23.059 --> 00:59:26.562
TRANSIT INTO ACROSS THAT. TO

00:59:26.629 --> 00:59:28.164
LISTEN TO ENCOURAGE SENATE-

00:59:28.231 --> 00:59:29.732

00:59:29.799 --> 00:59:32.435
STATUTORY CLOSURE. YEAH BECAUSE

00:59:32.502 --> 00:59:34.270
THAT I THINK THAT PART IS THE

00:59:34.337 --> 00:59:36.306
PROBLEMATIC PART THAT THE STATE

00:59:36.372 --> 00:59:38.341
DOES ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR

00:59:38.408 --> 00:59:40.476
RETIRING THE BONDS AND FOR THE

00:59:40.543 --> 00:59:41.711
WOULD HAVE TO MAINTAIN THE ROAD

00:59:41.778 --> 00:59:43.713
ALSO BECAUSE THERE'S A CONTRACT

00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:46.516

THAT THIS IS THE ONLY ONE AND IT

00:59:53.656 --> 00:59:56.092
THE DIFFERENCE- OUGHT WHEN I WAS

00:59:56.159 --> 00:59:57.593
ON THE COASTAL COMMISSION AND

00:59:57.660 --> 00:59:59.662
WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE

00:59:59.729 --> 01:00:00.997
HIGHWAY PROPOSAL'S. TOLL

01:00:01.064 --> 01:00:02.498
PROPOSALS TO ORANGE COUNTY WHEN

01:00:02.565 --> 01:00:04.300
I'VE SOUGHT SEEN THE ALIGNMENTS

01:00:04.367 --> 01:00:06.736
LIKE THE- WHAT IS IT THE SEVENTY

01:00:06.803 --> 01:00:08.438
THREE THAT'S THE TOLL ROAD THAT

01:00:08.504 --> 01:00:09.872
CUTS THROUGH. THE ARGUMENTS WERE

01:00:09.939 --> 01:00:11.975
OF THOSE HIGHWAYS WERE MORE

01:00:12.041 --> 01:00:15.511
INTENDED TO CUT- THE- ELIMINATE

01:00:15.578 --> 01:00:17.246
EASE A BURDEN ON TRAFFIC AND TO

01:00:17.313 --> 01:00:19.215
CREATE SHORTER ROUTES TO HELP

01:00:19.282 --> 01:00:21.284
PEOPLE GET THERE FASTER IN THIS

01:00:21.351 --> 01:00:23.586
THE CASE OF THIS- FREE WITHOUT

01:00:23.653 --> 01:00:25.955
WASN'T. THE INTENDED PURPOSE

01:00:26.022 --> 01:00:27.924
THIS FREEWAYS INTENDED PURPOSE

01:00:27.991 --> 01:00:30.059
WAS TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO QUITE

01:00:30.126 --> 01:00:33.496
A BIT. OF NEW DEVELOPMENT THAT

01:00:33.563 --> 01:00:39.268
REALLY WENT OUT AND. EASTER

01:00:39.335 --> 01:00:40.770
CHÁVEZ TO. EXPONENTIALLY IN THIS

01:00:40.837 --> 01:00:41.637
HIGH. WAS REGION INTENDED

01:00:41.704 --> 01:00:43.473
PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR ALL THAT

01:00:43.539 --> 01:00:45.575
HOUSING AND IN SOME AREAS YOU

01:00:45.641 --> 01:00:47.877
HAVE VERY DENSE HOUSING. AND

01:00:47.944 --> 01:00:49.645
THEN YOU ALSO HAVE THE TRUCK

01:00:49.712 --> 01:00:52.415
CROSSING IN OTAY MESA WHICH ALSO

01:00:52.482 --> 01:00:53.983
HAS GROWN EXPONENTIALLY SINCE

01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:55.785
AMOUNT NINETIES THAT TRUCK ROUTE

01:00:55.852 --> 01:00:57.487
CROSSING. USED TO BE INSIDE THE

01:00:57.553 --> 01:00:59.722
C. THEIR OWN IT WAS MOVED EAST

01:00:59.789 --> 01:01:01.124
WHICH PROVIDES PROVIDED AN

01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:05.128
ADDITIONAL BURDEN. TO THE

01:01:05.194 --> 01:01:06.696
STREETS OF THAT AREA SO. BUT

01:01:06.763 --> 01:01:08.064
THERE'S A QUITE A BIG

01:01:08.131 --> 01:01:10.700
DISTINCTION WITH THIS HIGHWAY

01:01:10.767 --> 01:01:12.068
AND THE ONES IN ORANGE COUNTY

01:01:12.135 --> 01:01:14.237
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE ARGUING

01:01:14.303 --> 01:01:15.671
THAT INITIALLY THE STATE WOULD

01:01:15.738 --> 01:01:17.273
HAVE BUILT THIS ONE WAY OR

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:18.908
ANOTHER BUT DURING ALL THOSE

01:01:18.975 --> 01:01:21.277
TOUGH ECONOMIC TIMES. THE STATE

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:24.514
CAN MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS YEAH

01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:25.681

DEVELOPMENT OF LEVEL THREE FAST

02:58:37.807 --> 02:58:39.175
CHARGING. EIGHT EIGHT LESS

02:58:39.241 --> 02:58:41.377
EXPENSIVE OPTIONS THE REQUIRED

PARKING SPACE THAT COMMITTEE

02:58:44.046 --> 02:58:45.981
ANOTHER SUGGESTS RETROFITTING A

02:58:46.048 --> 02:58:48.818
FEW LEVEL. CHARTERS ABBOTT MUCH

02:58:48.884 --> 02:58:51.187
COST. I KNOW THE AUTHOR STATED

02:58:51.253 --> 02:58:52.955
THE COST AND IT SEEMS MINIMAL

02:58:53.022 --> 02:58:55.825
BUT- NOT TOO LONG COME

02:58:55.891 --> 02:58:57.726
COMMUNITIES. THAT MAY BE SUBJECT

02:58:57.793 --> 02:59:03.532
BETWEEN THEM HAVING ACCESS. RB

02:59:03.599 --> 02:59:04.733
LEFT OUT ALTOGETHER SO AGAIN I

02:59:20.950 --> 02:59:23.319
LITTLE BIT AS A TEAM. I'M NOT

02:59:23.385 --> 02:59:24.720

03:00:38.460 --> 03:00:40.863
RELATIVE TO THE INDUSTRY WHICH

03:00:40.930 --> 03:00:44.567
IS BASICALLY THE OPPOSITION- FOR

03:00:44.633 --> 03:00:46.502
ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES- DO

03:00:46.569 --> 03:00:47.770

THAT INTO ACCOUNT AND THAT'S

03:01:07.890 --> 03:01:11.126
PROBABLY PART OF THE ON GOING TO

03:01:11.193 --> 03:01:12.661
. SHOULD BE. A NO BRAINER FOR

03:01:12.728 --> 03:01:14.697
THE INDUSTRY I CAN'T THINK OF. A

03:01:14.763 --> 03:01:16.465
CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE MULTI FAMILY

03:01:16.532 --> 03:01:18.367

03:01:37.119 --> 03:01:39.488
SLIPS BY WITH OTHER PARTS OF IT

03:01:39.555 --> 03:01:42.691
ARE- I THINK OR- FOR MORE

03:01:42.758 --> 03:01:44.460
PURPORTED TO BE MORE PRACTICAL

03:01:44.526 --> 03:01:45.761

03:02:00.676 --> 03:02:04.113
SORT OF A MISTAKE IF SOMEBODY

OPPOSITION WHERE THERE'S A

03:03:48.016 --> 03:03:50.285
POTENTIAL INCREASE ELECTRIC

03:03:50.352 --> 03:03:52.321
RATES BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE

03:03:52.388 --> 03:03:54.223
TO UPGRADE THE LOCAL- JUST USE A

03:03:54.289 --> 03:03:56.892
NETWORK TO SELL THEM THOSE COSTS

03:03:56.959 --> 03:03:58.660
ARE ALWAYS FUN TO THE RATE

ABOUT THAT AND THAT WILL TAKE

03:04:55.384 --> 03:04:56.251
INVESTMENT EFFECT WE WERE

03:04:56.318 --> 03:04:57.219
TALKING ABOUT AND SENATE

03:04:57.286 --> 03:04:59.288
DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS TODAY THAT

03:04:59.354 --> 03:05:00.355
THAT'S GONNA BE. PART OF THE

03:05:00.422 --> 03:05:04.259
BUDGET- BUT- BUT IT BUT IT WILL

03:05:04.326 --> 03:05:05.160
SAVE ME FROM AN EQUITY

03:05:05.227 --> 03:05:06.195
PERSPECTIVE THIS ACTUALLY IS

03:05:06.261 --> 03:05:06.795
ULTIMATELY ABOUT MAKING SURE.

GARAGE IS THE SITE NOT A REALITY

03:05:16.505 --> 03:05:18.240
FOR THIS. BUT LARGE NUMBER OF

03:05:18.307 --> 03:05:19.942
LOWER NCOME PEOPLE AND SO

03:05:20.008 --> 03:05:21.477
THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS IS ABOUT

03:05:21.543 --> 03:05:23.111
MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE

03:05:23.178 --> 03:05:23.879
ACCESS IN THEIR GARAGE

03:05:23.946 --> 03:05:26.181

03:05:44.600 --> 03:05:46.535
REALLY AND I. OF THAT AND I

03:05:46.602 --> 03:05:48.437
THINK THOSE THINGS GET LOST. IN

03:05:48.504 --> 03:05:50.005
THE GOAL OF LIFE THAT OF HAVING

LINDA HUTCHINS KNOWLES ON BEHALF

03:30:25.746 --> 03:30:27.681
OF A TERRA. WE ARE CONCERNED

03:30:27.748 --> 03:30:28.949
ABOUT THIS BILL BECAUSE WE SEE

03:30:29.016 --> 03:30:30.584
THAT THE INDUSTRY HAS MOVED

03:30:30.651 --> 03:30:31.919
DECISIVELY IN FAVOR OF

03:30:31.986 --> 03:30:34.288
AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY. AND NOT

03:30:34.355 --> 03:30:35.956
FOR HYDROGEN FOR LIGHT DUTY

03:30:36.023 --> 03:30:37.624
VEHICLES. THERE ARE MANY REASONS

03:30:37.691 --> 03:30:39.293
WHY BATTERY ELECTRIC. ARE MUCH

03:30:39.360 --> 03:30:41.628
SUPERIOR TO FUEL VEHICLES FIRST

03:30:41.695 --> 03:30:43.397
THEY ARE MUCH MORE EFFICIENT.

03:30:43.464 --> 03:30:45.332
ALSO 95% OF THE HYDROGEN

03:30:45.399 --> 03:30:46.934
CURRENTLY USED IN FUEL CELL

03:30:47.001 --> 03:30:48.635
VEHICLES COMES FROM FOSSIL FUEL

03:30:48.702 --> 03:30:50.671
SOURCES THIS IS A COUNTRY TO OUR

03:30:50.738 --> 03:30:52.606
CLIMATE GOALS. SECOND BATTERY

03:30:52.673 --> 03:30:54.108
ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE MUCH MORE

03:30:54.174 --> 03:30:56.643
ECONOMICAL FOR DRIVERS. THE COST

03:30:56.710 --> 03:30:57.911
FOUR TIMES AS MUCH TO FUEL AND

03:30:57.978 --> 03:31:00.581
FCV BE LIKE A TOYOTA MIRAI MIRAI

03:31:00.647 --> 03:31:02.216
THAN A BATTLE TO VEHICLE LIKE A

TESLA MODEL S. AND THIRD DRIVING

03:31:05.386 --> 03:31:06.353
BEVS ARE MUCH MORE PRACTICAL

03:31:06.420 --> 03:31:07.688

03:31:11.925 --> 03:31:13.994
TRYING TO PUT IT MORE BUT EACH

03:31:14.061 --> 03:31:14.695
ONE COST ONE TO TWO MILLION

03:31:14.762 --> 03:31:19.933

HEARD THAT THE PER. BOSS OF

03:59:31.457 --> 03:59:32.191
HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE OUR

03:59:32.257 --> 03:59:33.425
COMPATIBLE TO CHARGING IN ONE OF

03:59:33.492 --> 03:59:34.893
THE UNIQUE THINGS ABOUT HYDROGEN

03:59:34.960 --> 03:59:36.595
AS THAT WE ARE ON A PATHWAY TO

03:59:36.662 --> 03:59:37.796
SELF SUFFICIENCY. THERE

03:59:37.863 --> 03:59:40.332
RESOURCES BOARD FOUND WITH AN

03:59:40.399 --> 03:59:40.966
ADDITIONAL THREE HUNDRED MILLION

03:59:41.033 --> 03:59:41.867
WE WOULD HAVE A FULLY

03:59:41.934 --> 03:59:43.368
FUNCTIONING LIGHT DUTY AND

03:59:43.435 --> 03:59:45.137
MEDIUM DUTY. HYDROGEN FUELING

03:59:45.204 --> 03:59:46.805
NETWORK SO THIS IS KIND OF AN

03:59:46.872 --> 03:59:48.073
EXAMPLE OF AN EMERGING GREEN

03:59:48.140 --> 03:59:50.175
TECHNOLOGY THAT IS ABLE TO STAND

03:59:50.242 --> 03:59:52.177
ON ITS OWN AND NO LONGER NEED

03:59:52.244 --> 03:59:52.845
SUBSIDY. SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE

03:59:52.911 --> 03:59:54.646
YET TO FIND WITH A LOT OF OUR

03:59:54.713 --> 03:59:56.081
OTHER COMPUTING AND TECHNOLOGY

03:59:56.148 --> 03:59:57.750
SO SOMETHING WE'RE VERY EXCITED

03:59:57.816 --> 03:59:59.051
OF MARIE VERY PROUD OF. I'M

03:59:59.118 --> 04:00:00.686
REALLY WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR

04:00:00.753 --> 04:00:01.653
FOR HIS SUPPORT AND HIS

04:00:01.720 --> 04:00:03.989
LEADERSHIP ON THIS I'VE YOU KNOW

04:00:04.056 --> 04:00:05.190
THIRTEEN TWENTY NINE WILL ENSURE

04:00:05.257 --> 04:00:06.658
EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA. HAS THE

04:00:06.725 --> 04:00:07.993
ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITY TO

04:00:08.060 --> 04:00:09.695

04:00:31.216 --> 04:00:32.184
MISSION TRANSPORTATION IN

04:00:32.251 --> 04:00:33.619
CALIFORNIA. I AM A PROFESSOR OF

04:00:33.685 --> 04:00:34.887
MECHANICAL AND AEROSPACE

04:00:34.953 --> 04:00:36.488
ENGINEERING HERE AT UC IRVINE

04:00:36.555 --> 04:00:39.224
AND THAT OUR ANALYSES. OF ZERO

04:00:39.291 --> 04:00:41.160
EMISSIONS TRANSPORTATION AND THE

04:00:41.226 --> 04:00:42.961
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO SUPPORT

04:00:43.028 --> 04:00:45.931
SUCH. SHOWS THAT WE WILL NEED TO

04:00:45.998 --> 04:00:47.432
INVEST IN BOTH. ELECTRIC

04:00:47.499 --> 04:00:50.002
VEHICLES STARTING IN IN HYDROGEN

04:00:50.068 --> 04:00:51.170
FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE

04:00:51.236 --> 04:00:53.605
STATE. AS WE HAVE IN THE PAST.

04:00:53.672 --> 04:00:55.808
AND WHILE HYDROGEN HAS DISTINCT

04:00:55.874 --> 04:00:57.209
ADVANTAGES OVER BATTERY

04:00:57.276 --> 04:00:58.644
ESPECIALLY IN HEAVY DUTY

04:00:58.710 --> 04:01:00.579
APPLICATIONS. YOU DO IT PASSED

04:01:00.646 --> 04:01:02.114
THE FUELING LONG RANGE OF HEAVY

04:01:02.181 --> 04:01:04.716
PAYLOAD CAPABILITY. HYDROGEN

04:01:04.783 --> 04:01:06.985
WILL ALSO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE

04:01:07.052 --> 04:01:08.787
IN REDUCING TO ZERO EMISSIONS IN

04:01:08.854 --> 04:01:10.389
THE LIKE THE ACTOR. MOST

04:01:10.455 --> 04:01:12.891
IMPORTANTLY. DISADVANTAGED

04:01:12.958 --> 04:01:14.026
COMMUNITIES THAT WE TALK ABOUT

04:01:14.092 --> 04:01:18.497
ALMOST ALL. ACTION HERE. EARLY

04:01:18.564 --> 04:01:20.265
LIMON RENTAL PROPERTY AND NOT

04:01:20.332 --> 04:01:21.099
EASILY GARNER AT. ZERO EMISSION

THE FEDERAL. CHARGING AT THE

04:01:33.912 --> 04:01:35.881
MOMENT. I PROJECT WILL ALSO BE

04:01:35.948 --> 04:01:39.451
REQUIRED TO SERVE A PORTION OF

04:01:39.518 --> 04:01:40.219
THE LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE THROUGH

04:01:40.285 --> 04:01:43.121
OUT THE STATE WHEN THE OPTION OF

04:01:43.188 --> 04:01:45.424
THAT BECOME VERY LARGE THAT IS.

04:01:45.490 --> 04:01:47.392
AT WORK IS A HUNDRED PERCENT.

04:01:47.459 --> 04:01:49.361
BECAUSE NEIGHBORHOOD ELECTRIC

04:01:49.428 --> 04:01:51.230
CIRCUIT. THROUGHOUT THE STATE

04:01:51.296 --> 04:01:53.966
CAN HANDLE THEM AND INSPIRATION

04:01:54.032 --> 04:01:55.767
HERE IF YOU'RE SIXTY PERCENT.

04:01:55.834 --> 04:01:57.870
BUT CANNOT ACCOMMODATE ENTIRE

04:01:57.936 --> 04:01:59.538
NEIGHBORHOODS THAT STARTING

04:01:59.605 --> 04:02:02.741
WITHOUT A VERY LARGE INVESTMENT

04:02:02.808 --> 04:02:04.610
. FINALLY THERE IS SYNERGY

04:02:04.676 --> 04:02:06.245
BETWEEN THE FUELING OF MEDIUM

04:02:06.311 --> 04:02:07.379
AND HEAVY DUTY CREDIT

04:02:07.446 --> 04:02:09.848

WHICH WHEN COMBINED HAVE THE

04:02:12.184 --> 04:02:14.486
GREATEST POTENTIAL TO REDUCE THE

04:02:14.553 --> 04:02:16.488
COST OF HYDROGEN FOR CONSUMER. I

04:02:16.555 --> 04:02:18.357
WANT TO END WITH THIS STATEMENT

04:02:18.423 --> 04:02:20.125
WE MUST URGENTLY ENABLE THAT

04:02:20.192 --> 04:02:22.060
HAVE ADOPTION ESPECIALLY IN

TO SB THIRTEEN TWENTY NINE. WE

04:05:52.737 --> 04:05:54.473
URGE ALL OF YOU TO PLEASE

04:05:54.539 --> 04:05:56.641
QUESTION THE HYDROGEN HYPE. IT'S

04:05:56.708 --> 04:05:58.543
A SOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A

04:05:58.610 --> 04:06:02.147
PROBLEM. YES THEY MAY BE ZERO

04:06:02.214 --> 04:06:04.316
EMISSIONS AT THE PLACE OF THE

04:06:04.382 --> 04:06:06.451
CAR BUT CONSIDER WHERE THE

04:06:06.518 --> 04:06:08.620
HYDROGEN IS BEING PRODUCED BY

04:06:08.687 --> 04:06:09.988
95% OF IT CURRENTLY IS PRODUCED

04:06:10.055 --> 04:06:12.290
BY FOSSIL FUELS YOUR DISPLACING

04:06:12.357 --> 04:06:14.259
THE POLLUTION TO FRONTLINE

04:06:14.326 --> 04:06:16.261
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. THIS IS AN

04:06:16.328 --> 04:06:17.896
EQUITABLE IN THE CLIMATE

04:06:17.963 --> 04:06:20.732
INJUSTICE. BATTERY ELECTRIC

04:06:20.799 --> 04:06:22.234
VEHICLES ARE MUCH LESS CARBON

04:06:22.300 --> 04:06:23.768
INTENSIVE AND FAR MORE EFFICIENT

04:06:23.835 --> 04:06:26.171
AS A SOURCE OF LIGHT VEHICLE

04:06:26.238 --> 04:06:27.806
POWER. THESE COMPANIES ARE

04:06:27.873 --> 04:06:29.040
ATTEMPTING TO GREEN WASH THEIR

04:06:29.107 --> 04:06:30.609
HYDROGEN WITHOUT CONSIDERING ITS

04:06:30.675 --> 04:06:32.644
CARBON INTENSITY. THAT SHOULD BE

04:06:32.711 --> 04:06:33.812
THE SOLE METRIC BY WHICH THE

04:06:33.879 --> 04:06:34.946
GREEN CREDENTIALS OF HYDROGEN

04:06:35.013 --> 04:06:37.482
ARE JUDGED. SECOND HYDROGEN

04:06:37.549 --> 04:06:39.017
NEEDS TO BE STORED AND

04:06:39.084 --> 04:06:40.285
TRANSPORTED EITHER AS A HIGH

04:06:40.352 --> 04:06:42.420
PRESSURE GAS OR THE CRYOGENIC

04:06:42.487 --> 04:06:44.422
LIQUID MAKING IT MUCH MORE

04:06:44.489 --> 04:06:45.790
HAZARDOUS TO HANDLE. PLEASE DO

04:06:45.857 --> 04:06:47.492
NOT PUT THESE FUELING STATIONS

04:06:47.559 --> 04:06:50.295
IN IT POPULATION CENTERS THIS IS

04:06:50.362 --> 04:06:52.030
A DISASTER WAITING TO HAPPEN.

04:06:52.097 --> 04:06:53.832
BECAUSE HYDROGEN MOLECULES ARE

04:06:53.899 --> 04:06:55.033
SO MUCH FOR THE NATURAL GAS

04:06:55.100 --> 04:06:56.334
METHANE. THEY ARE NOT
