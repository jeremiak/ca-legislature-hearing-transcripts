SPEED AND EFFICIENCY OF THE

LIKE RECIPROCAL CARGO COMING

01:02:22.538 --> 01:02:24.373
BACK AND AGAIN IF WE COULD MOVE

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.776
IT DURING OFF PEAK HOURS FREE UP

01:02:26.843 --> 01:02:28.244
THE GATES FOR THOSE MERCHANTS

01:02:28.311 --> 01:02:30.146

THAT MAKES OUR BUSINESS

01:02:35.184 --> 01:02:39.355
PROPOSITION EVEN MORE. IMPORTANT

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:41.390
TO THE INTERNATIONAL TRADER

GREAT THANK YOU- AYE MR SIRI. I

01:02:48.898 --> 01:02:50.199
DO AND I JUST WHAT DO YOU KNOW.

01:02:50.266 --> 01:02:52.468
A THE STATE'S ROLE- YOU TALK

01:02:52.535 --> 01:02:53.703
ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE THERE'S THE

01:02:53.769 --> 01:02:55.638
IT INFRASTRUCTURE. AND ANOTHER

01:02:55.705 --> 01:02:57.006
IS A BUDGET ASKING FOR THAT FROM

01:02:57.073 --> 01:02:59.075
THE PORTS BOTH PORTS. AND ALSO

01:02:59.142 --> 01:03:00.643
SOME MONEY FOR OFFICERS AND HARD

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:02.278
INFRASTRUCTURE. AND YOU CITED

01:03:02.345 --> 01:03:03.679
SEEK WAS BEING A CHALLENGE IT

01:03:03.746 --> 01:03:05.181
LOOKS SEEK WAS QUITE FRANKLY PUT

01:03:05.248 --> 01:03:07.016
US IN A STALEMATE. WE CAN'T DO

01:03:07.083 --> 01:03:08.851
IT LESS ZERO BUT WE DON'T HAVE

01:03:08.918 --> 01:03:10.419
ZERO WE CAN'T DO IT. SO THE FACT

01:03:10.486 --> 01:03:11.988
OF THE MATTER IS MAYBE WE GO

01:03:12.054 --> 01:03:13.022
NEAR ZERO AND THEN WHEN THE TIME

01:03:13.089 --> 01:03:14.724
COMES GO TO ZERO WHEN THAT

01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:15.825
TECHNOLOGY IS AVAILABLE. SO THAT

01:03:15.892 --> 01:03:17.560
SOMETHING POLICY MAKERS HAVE TO

01:03:17.627 --> 01:03:19.195
CONSIDER BECAUSE SPORTS HAVE TO

01:03:19.262 --> 01:03:21.397
MAKE GREEN TO GO GREEN. AND WE

01:03:21.464 --> 01:03:23.299
NEED MORE VELOCITY WE NEED MORE

01:03:23.366 --> 01:03:25.268
INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT'S GOING TO

01:03:25.334 --> 01:03:27.837
TAKE SOME- VERNON LOOKS TO HAVE

01:03:27.904 --> 01:03:29.272
TO LOOK CLOSELY AT HOW WE CAN

01:03:29.338 --> 01:03:30.273
USE SEQUENCE TO ACHIEVE

01:03:30.339 --> 01:03:31.607
CERTAINLY ARE GREEN GOALS BUT

QUESTION VERY DIRECTLY- OUR

01:06:05.995 --> 01:06:07.396
SYSTEM WIDE CONGESTION DURING

01:06:07.463 --> 01:06:15.237
THE. JIM WAS TALKING ABOUT

01:06:15.304 --> 01:06:16.906
MANIFESTED SO IN A TERM. SO AN

01:06:16.972 --> 01:06:19.342
ARMORY TERMINAL OPERATOR- WE

01:06:19.408 --> 01:06:20.242
HAVE SO MUCH ACREAGE SOME

01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:22.211
ABILITY TO MOVE CARGO. WHEN THAT

01:06:22.278 --> 01:06:25.081
TERMINAL IS FOR. OF CAR. IN

01:06:25.147 --> 01:06:28.184
LATER. EXPORT WORK. IT'S OUR

01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:30.152
VESSEL LOW AND I TO. THAT EXTRA

01:06:30.219 --> 01:06:34.256
OUR TIME IN BIRTH- AND WHEN WE

01:06:34.323 --> 01:06:35.291
EXTEND TIME OF BIRTH WE HAVE

01:06:35.358 --> 01:06:39.428
LATEST. THE DEAD LATEST PHYSICS

01:06:39.495 --> 01:06:40.863
WE'VE SEEN WITH THAT THROUGH Q.

01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:42.531
FOUR OF TWO THOUSAND TWO ONE

01:06:42.598 --> 01:06:43.132
AVERAGE TIME FOR BOTH OF THE

01:06:43.199 --> 01:06:45.267
BIRTH IN NORTH. WAS SEVEN DAYS

01:06:45.334 --> 01:06:46.802
THAT'S 20% LONGER THAN WAS

01:06:46.869 --> 01:06:49.271
PRETTY PENDEK IN THE CASCADES WE

01:06:49.338 --> 01:06:50.806
SHIP STATE OF BIRTH LONGER

01:06:50.873 --> 01:06:51.874
THERE'S BEEN FURTHER OFF

01:06:51.941 --> 01:06:53.676
SCHEDULE. AND WHEN THEY'RE OFF

01:06:53.743 --> 01:06:54.910
SCHEDULE THE BACK OF THE SHIP

01:06:54.977 --> 01:06:56.479
BEHIND THEM PUTTING THEM FURTHER

01:06:56.545 --> 01:06:58.247
OFF SCHEDULE WHEN SHIPS ARE

01:06:58.314 --> 01:06:59.749
COLLECTIVELY DELAYED NOT

01:06:59.815 --> 01:07:01.817
SCHEDULING NORTH AMERICA. THAT'S

01:07:01.884 --> 01:07:03.252
THE WAY THINKING JOBS THE RETURN

01:07:03.319 --> 01:07:05.154
TO ASIA WE END UP WITH SKIP

01:07:05.221 --> 01:07:07.189
SAILINGS MISS SAILINGS AN

01:07:07.256 --> 01:07:09.492
ADDITIONAL DELAY ALL OF THESE

01:07:09.558 --> 01:07:14.530
THINGS. BASICALLY. RESULT IN

01:07:14.597 --> 01:07:15.431
LESS CAPACITY. EIGHT TIMES HI

01:07:15.498 --> 01:07:18.634
RATES MARKOFF'S. PROFICIENCY WHY

01:07:18.701 --> 01:07:20.669
WE'RE DEALING WITH HIGH VOLUME-

01:07:20.736 --> 01:07:22.338
YOU KNOW. AGAIN WE CAN'T

01:07:22.405 --> 01:07:24.106
REEMPHASIZED ENOUGH AND IT

01:07:24.173 --> 01:07:26.375
PROBABLY GOES WITHOUT SAYING-

01:07:26.442 --> 01:07:28.244
BUT I WANT TO REITERATE HERE. WE

01:07:28.310 --> 01:07:29.678
ARE MOVING MORE CARGO THAN EVER

01:07:29.745 --> 01:07:32.515
BEFORE. IN THE MIDST OF PANDEMIC

01:07:32.581 --> 01:07:34.283
IT IS WORTH AGAIN TAKING THE

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:35.918
TIME OUT TO SAY THANK YOU TO OUR

01:07:35.985 --> 01:07:37.620
DEDICATED WATERFRONT LABOR

01:07:37.686 --> 01:07:40.623
FORCE. ALL OF OUR SUPPLY CHAIN

01:07:40.689 --> 01:07:42.024
PARTNERS. MOVING AS A CENTRAL

01:07:42.091 --> 01:07:43.959
WORKERS IN THIS ECONOMY HAS BEEN

01:07:44.026 --> 01:07:47.830
TOUGH PEOPLE ARE DOING IT- BUT-

01:07:47.897 --> 01:07:50.866
TO THE POINT OF THIS THIS

01:07:50.933 --> 01:07:52.802
HEARING- WE HAVEN'T DONE A

01:07:52.868 --> 01:07:54.403
PERFECT- IT HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN

01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:56.605
PRETTY AND THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT

01:07:56.672 --> 01:07:57.640
OF MISSTEPS AND THOSE COSTS ARE

01:07:57.706 --> 01:07:59.809
THEN REFLECTED IN THE SYSTEM. WE

01:07:59.875 --> 01:08:01.210
HAVE TO WORK OUR WAY OUT OF

01:08:01.277 --> 01:08:02.478
BALANCE BY FOCUSING ON WHAT WE

01:08:02.545 --> 01:08:05.314
CAN CONTROL AND THAT'S TRYING TO

01:08:05.381 --> 01:08:06.749
REDUCE TERMINAL CONGESTION. THE

01:08:06.816 --> 01:08:09.185
OTHER CONTEXTS BROTHER THIS IS

01:08:09.251 --> 01:08:12.555
OBVIOUSLY THAT- THE ACTUAL WAY

01:08:12.621 --> 01:08:14.457
THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT THE PORT

01:08:14.523 --> 01:08:16.425
ECOSYSTEM IS STILL IN THE

01:08:16.492 --> 01:08:18.928
CONTEXT OF PRE COATED AND IT

01:08:18.994 --> 01:08:21.797
SHOULD BE. BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE

01:08:21.864 --> 01:08:23.232
IS THE ENVIRONMENT WHICH HAS

01:08:23.299 --> 01:08:26.001
ALWAYS BEEN ESSENTIALLY FRAMED

01:08:26.068 --> 01:08:27.636
BY THE CONTEXT WITHIN THE GLOBAL

01:08:27.703 --> 01:08:30.172
ECONOMY. WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

01:08:30.239 --> 01:08:33.676
TRADE DEFICIT. THE UNITED STATES

01:08:33.742 --> 01:08:36.178
ISN'T IMPORTING NATION- AND WHAT

01:08:36.245 --> 01:08:37.947
THAT HAS MEANT IS THAT WE ALWAYS

01:08:38.013 --> 01:08:40.382
HAVE AN IMBALANCE IN TOTAL TRADE

01:08:40.449 --> 01:08:42.351
BUT WE FOUND AN EQUILIBRIUM FOR

01:08:42.418 --> 01:08:43.752
EVERY CAN CAN ONLY BRING AND

01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:44.820
EVENTUALLY THAT NEEDS TO GO

01:08:44.887 --> 01:08:47.056
SOMEWHERE ELSE HE JUST MOVED

01:08:47.122 --> 01:08:49.558
WHETHER IT'S FULL OR EMPTY- AND

01:08:49.625 --> 01:08:51.393
WHAT WE FOUND IN THE NORMAL

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:53.395
TIMES IS THAT THAT'S A BENEFIT

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:54.930
TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND

01:08:54.997 --> 01:08:56.932
TO OUR EXPORTERS- IN THE QUICK

01:08:56.999 --> 01:08:58.634
EXPLANATION FOR THIS IS THE

01:08:58.701 --> 01:09:00.169
OVERSIMPLIFICATION CARE ALL

01:09:00.236 --> 01:09:01.604
THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE GOING TO

01:09:01.670 --> 01:09:04.940
BE THIS MORNING- AND I. THINK IT

01:09:05.007 --> 01:09:08.077
BECAUSE OF THE TO THE POINT OF

01:09:08.143 --> 01:09:09.879
SAYING. WHEN WE HAVE A ROBUST

01:23:54.028 --> 01:23:55.897
GLOBE YOU CAN USE THE SAME

01:23:55.964 --> 01:23:56.564
EQUIPMENT FOR ALL TYPES OF

01:23:56.631 --> 01:23:58.032
DIFFERENT THINGS ON ALL TYPE OF

01:23:58.099 --> 01:24:00.034
THE FOR MODES OF TRANSPORTATION

01:24:00.101 --> 01:24:03.338
SHIPS TRUCKS TRAINS- IN ANY

01:24:03.405 --> 01:24:05.473
COUNTRY. AND WITH JUST THE MAGIC

01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:08.176
OF AN INTERCHANGEABLE AND- YOU

01:24:08.243 --> 01:24:09.677
CAN HAVE CARGO GOING EVERYWHERE

01:24:09.744 --> 01:24:11.246
AND ANYWHERE AND IT'S NOT

01:24:11.312 --> 01:24:13.615
CENTRALIZED OBVIOUSLY THE EXACT

01:24:13.681 --> 01:24:15.250
OPPOSITE OF A CENTRALIZED

01:24:15.316 --> 01:24:17.986
MANAGED- SUPPLY CHAIN LIKE IN

01:24:18.052 --> 01:24:21.022
THE MILITARY. BUT THAT BEING

01:24:21.089 --> 01:24:22.157
SAID THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE

01:24:22.223 --> 01:24:24.025
PARTICIPANTS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN

01:24:24.092 --> 01:24:26.161
AND- DON'T KNOW WHERE THE CARGO

01:24:26.227 --> 01:24:28.196
IS I THINK WHAT JIM WAS TALKING

01:24:28.263 --> 01:24:30.031
ABOUT WAS THE ABILITY TO

01:24:30.098 --> 01:24:32.367
INTERFACE AND BE TRANSPARENT.

01:24:32.434 --> 01:24:34.502
WITH END USERS AND- OTHER

01:24:34.569 --> 01:24:36.671
PARTIES INCLUDING THE STATE

01:24:36.738 --> 01:24:39.541
ANOTHER PUBLIC- ENTITIES AND SO

01:24:39.607 --> 01:24:42.210
THAT THAT'S A DIFFERENT RIGHT

01:24:42.277 --> 01:24:44.212
THERE'S NOT A SINGLE CARRIER-

01:24:44.279 --> 01:24:45.346
WHETHER IT BE AN OCEAN CARRIER

01:24:45.413 --> 01:24:47.081
RAIL CARRIER AND A MOTOR CARRIER

01:24:47.148 --> 01:24:49.517
THAT DOESN'T KNOW. WHICH BOXES

01:24:49.584 --> 01:24:52.587
CARRYING WHERE IT IS. AND HOW

01:24:52.654 --> 01:24:53.922
THAT GOING TO PROCEED THROUGH

01:24:53.988 --> 01:24:55.890
ITS PORTION OF THAT SUPPLY CHAIN

01:24:55.957 --> 01:24:57.759
UNDER A BILL OF LADING- THE

01:24:57.826 --> 01:24:59.694
QUESTION IS CAN THE THINGS BE

01:24:59.761 --> 01:25:02.163
COORDINATED- AND CAN THAT

01:25:02.230 --> 01:25:03.665
INFORMATION BE INTERCHANGED

01:25:03.731 --> 01:25:06.534
OUTSIDE THAT PROPRIETARY SPACE.

01:25:06.601 --> 01:25:09.003
AND SO I THINK THERE'S TWO

01:25:09.070 --> 01:25:10.104
THINGS ABOUT THAT BUT WE'RE

01:25:10.171 --> 01:25:13.007
WORKING ON ONE IS- TO OF LA'S

01:25:13.074 --> 01:25:15.310
CREDIT MAY ALREADY DO HAVE

01:25:15.376 --> 01:25:17.045
TRANSPARENCY INTO A LOT OF THAT

01:25:17.111 --> 01:25:18.613
AND THEY PUBLISH IT AND AS JEAN

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:20.348
SAID THAT A LOT OF THAT

01:25:20.415 --> 01:25:23.518
INFORMATION IN THERE- IN. THE

01:25:23.585 --> 01:25:25.587
PAST WE'VE HAD OURS SENSATION

01:25:25.653 --> 01:25:28.022
OTHER ASSOCIATIONS WE HAVE PADS

01:25:28.089 --> 01:25:31.292
SEPARATE COMPONENTS OF THESE-

01:25:31.359 --> 01:25:34.262
DATA. PUT TOGETHER UNDER OUR OWN

01:25:34.329 --> 01:25:37.098
PROPRIETARY AUSPICES SO FOR

01:25:37.165 --> 01:25:39.067
EXAMPLE YOU KNOW OUR SITUATION

01:25:39.133 --> 01:25:42.570
TRACKS DO WELL TIME- BUT YOU

01:25:42.637 --> 01:25:44.005
KNOW A APA THE AMERICAN

01:25:44.072 --> 01:25:45.907
ASSOCIATION WHICH TRACK NATIONAL

01:25:45.974 --> 01:25:48.009
TO USE STATISTICS THERE IS NOT A

01:25:48.076 --> 01:25:50.144
WAY TO ACTUALLY FORMALIZE ALL OF

01:25:50.211 --> 01:25:56.284
THOSE THINGS. IN ONE PLACE WHERE

01:25:56.351 --> 01:25:58.052
YOU SEE THE ALL AND NOT OPERATE.

01:25:58.119 --> 01:26:00.655
TRANSPARENT EITHER ALL- GET- PUT

01:26:00.722 --> 01:26:05.727
INTO IT CUMULATIVE- CLOSE TALK.

01:26:05.793 --> 01:26:07.929
DATA SHOW PLACE WHERE IF YOU FOR

01:26:07.996 --> 01:26:09.297
WHAT TOWN BUT IT'S NOT GOOD FOR

01:26:09.364 --> 01:26:11.633
OUTCOME ON A REAL TIME DAY- THAT

01:26:11.699 --> 01:26:12.467
VERY HARD TO DO BECAUSE OF THE

01:26:12.534 --> 01:26:13.768
NATURE OF THIS IS TO BE

01:26:13.835 --> 01:26:15.003
DISTRIBUTORS AND IT'S TO BE A

01:26:15.069 --> 01:26:17.272
NON CENTRALLY CONTROLLED NETWORK

01:26:17.338 --> 01:26:18.273
AND THAT'S THE VALUE OF THE

01:26:18.339 --> 01:26:20.241
SYSTEM SO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK

01:26:20.308 --> 01:26:22.443
TO BE DONE- ONE OF THE THINGS

01:26:22.510 --> 01:26:24.612
THAT WAS PROPOSED- IN THE BUDGET

01:26:24.679 --> 01:26:28.483
NOW NOT SECTR RAFI- WOULD LIKE

01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:30.118
TO ELABORATED. ON IT BUT- THE

01:26:30.184 --> 01:26:31.853
PROPOSAL IN THE- GOVERNOR'S

01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:33.388
BUDGET FOR THIRTY MILLION

01:26:33.454 --> 01:26:35.490
DOLLARS TO. PREPARE FOR SOME

01:26:35.557 --> 01:26:37.692
ADDITIONAL DIGITAL ARCHITECTURE

01:26:37.759 --> 01:26:40.862
TO BE- DISCUSSED. IN THE FUTURE

01:26:40.929 --> 01:26:42.163
THERE'S NO TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE

01:26:42.230 --> 01:26:44.032
IN A SPECIFIC DIRECTION FOR WHAT

01:26:44.098 --> 01:26:45.633
HAPPENS WITH THAT LANGUAGE AT.

01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:47.669
BUT WE REPORT THAT WE THINK

01:26:47.735 --> 01:26:48.970
THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO BEGIN TO

01:26:49.037 --> 01:26:50.638
HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS AND ON

01:26:50.705 --> 01:26:52.507
ARCHITECTURAL BASIS ON A PORT BY

01:26:52.574 --> 01:26:55.176
PORT LEVEL. SO EACH PORK AND

01:26:55.243 --> 01:26:58.046
START WORKING WITH ITS OWN-

01:26:58.112 --> 01:26:59.948
TERMINALS TO DUMB CARRIERS MOTOR

01:27:00.014 --> 01:27:01.883
CARRIERS RAIL CARRIERS AND OCEAN

01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:03.751
CARRIERS. TO START TO PROVIDE

01:27:03.818 --> 01:27:05.687
SOME OF THAT. GREATER

01:27:05.753 --> 01:27:07.689
TRANSPARENCY TO THE SYSTEM- BUT

01:27:07.755 --> 01:27:10.325
IT IS HARD IT'S NOT CENTRALIZED.

01:27:10.391 --> 01:27:13.294
IT'S NOT. THAT PEOPLE DON'T HAVE

01:27:13.361 --> 01:27:14.529
THE INFORMATION IT'S MORE ABOUT

01:27:14.596 --> 01:27:16.297
MAKING INFORMATION AND A PLACE

01:27:16.364 --> 01:27:17.765
WHERE IT'S ACTIONABLE AND SUCH

01:27:17.832 --> 01:27:19.434
AN INCIDENT ACTUALLY TRANSPARENT

01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:20.735
TO PEOPLE WHO MAY BE MAKING

01:27:20.802 --> 01:27:23.004
DECISIONS- PHONE YOUR OPINION. I

01:27:23.071 --> 01:27:25.306
MEAN THAT. I'M NOT A BIG FAVOR

01:27:25.373 --> 01:27:27.442
THE GOVERNMENT MANDATES BUT BUT

01:27:27.508 --> 01:27:29.644
IF WE COULD HAVE A- CENTRAL LOT

01:27:29.711 --> 01:27:35.883
LIKE A. VOLUNTARY CENTRALIZED-

01:27:35.950 --> 01:27:37.652
GROUP WITHIN BILL. SO YOU GUYS

01:27:37.719 --> 01:27:38.353
CAN VOLUNTARY SENT THE

01:27:38.419 --> 01:27:40.622
INFORMATION IN REAL TIME. SO

01:27:40.688 --> 01:27:42.123
THAT WAY YOU KNOW FOLKS CAN GO

01:27:42.190 --> 01:27:43.491
ON L. A. R. R. AGRICULTURE

01:27:43.558 --> 01:27:45.059
SHIPPERS ARE MANUFACTURERS AND

01:27:45.126 --> 01:27:47.028
EVERYBODY CAN GO IN REAL TIME.

01:27:47.095 --> 01:27:49.497
IN IN KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THIS IS

01:27:49.564 --> 01:27:50.098
GOING BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE

01:27:50.164 --> 01:27:52.066
SOMETHING FOR. YOU KNOW ON THE

01:27:52.133 --> 01:27:53.701
BUSINESS AND IF YOU HAVE HIGH

01:27:53.768 --> 01:27:56.337
SCORED WITHIN A VOLUNTARY SYSTEM

01:27:56.404 --> 01:27:57.472
THAN PEOPLE KNOW THIS IS THESE

01:27:57.538 --> 01:27:59.307
ARE THE PEOPLE I WANT TO SHIP

01:27:59.374 --> 01:28:00.174
WITH VERSUS SOMEBODY WHO'S NOT

01:28:00.241 --> 01:28:01.709
IN A VOLUNTARY SYSTEM SO THERE

01:28:01.776 --> 01:28:03.311
MIGHT ACTUALLY BE A WAY FOR THE

01:28:03.378 --> 01:28:05.346
MARKET TO NATURALLY INCREASE

01:28:05.413 --> 01:28:09.083
THEIR RATINGS AND. EXACTLY RIGHT

01:28:09.150 --> 01:28:11.119
AT THE VALUE ADD THERE IS AS YOU

01:28:11.185 --> 01:28:12.487
DESCRIBED IT AND I THINK WHAT

01:28:12.553 --> 01:28:13.855
YOU'LL HEAR FROM THE NEXT PANEL

01:28:13.921 --> 01:28:15.189
OR PEOPLE THAT ARE FRUSTRATED.

01:28:15.256 --> 01:28:16.491
BY THE LACK OF ACTIONABLE

01:28:16.557 --> 01:28:17.625
INFORMATION THAT WOULD ALLOW

01:28:17.692 --> 01:28:19.861
THEM TO ACTUALLY. MOVE CARGO

01:28:19.927 --> 01:28:21.829
FASTER BETTER SMARTER AND LESS

01:28:21.896 --> 01:28:25.533
COST. SO WE HAVE TENS OF

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:27.035
THOUSANDS OF EMPTY CONTAINERS

01:28:27.101 --> 01:28:28.269
SITTING ON CHATS IN SOUTHERN

01:28:28.336 --> 01:28:29.971
CALIFORNIA PRIVATE TRUCKING ARTS

01:28:30.038 --> 01:28:31.406
IN ADDITION TO THE JAZZ MUSIC

01:28:31.472 --> 01:28:33.541
AND- EMPTY THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:28:33.608 --> 01:28:35.410
FACILITATE ALL. TERMINALS BUT IT

01:28:35.476 --> 01:28:37.211
IS AN TRANSPARENT IN THE SYSTEM

01:28:37.278 --> 01:28:38.980
WHICH TRUCKING ARE THOSE THAT.

01:28:39.047 --> 01:28:40.715
ARE THOSE IN WHICH MOTOR

01:28:40.782 --> 01:28:43.084
CARRIERS HAVE THE ACCEPTABLE A

01:28:43.151 --> 01:28:44.719
QUICK MINUTE. HOW MUCH OF THAT

01:28:44.786 --> 01:28:47.121
EQUIPMENT IS ACTUALLY FOOD GRADE

01:28:47.188 --> 01:28:48.756
ARE WE WATCH WHICH CONTAINERS

01:28:48.823 --> 01:28:51.259
ARE REFRIGERATED. YOU KNOW AND

01:28:51.325 --> 01:28:52.493
THEN COORDINATING THOSE THINGS

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:54.162
BACK WITH VETTEL SET THE FAILING

01:28:54.228 --> 01:28:56.497
SCHEDULES SO I AM PLEASED TO SAY

01:28:56.564 --> 01:28:57.565
AND YOU'LL HEAR FROM THE GET THE

01:28:57.632 --> 01:28:58.966
DIRECTOR ONE WE DO HAVE.

01:28:59.033 --> 01:29:01.602
CONGESTION AGAIN AT OAKLAND WE

01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:02.837
HAVE SEVENTEEN SHIPS WAITING TO

01:29:02.904 --> 01:29:05.640
GET IN THERE. BUT IT'S- VERY

01:29:05.707 --> 01:29:08.176
FRUSTRATING TO OUR CUSTOMERS IF

01:29:08.242 --> 01:29:09.343
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL

01:29:09.410 --> 01:29:10.912
SAILING DATE IS BECAUSE THEN

01:29:10.978 --> 01:29:12.246
THEY DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY CAN

01:29:12.313 --> 01:29:13.448
BRING THEIR CARGO INTO THE

01:29:13.514 --> 01:29:15.883
ACTUAL MARINE TERMINAL. WE DON'T

01:29:15.950 --> 01:29:17.552
HAVE THE SPACE TO JUST TAKE

01:29:17.618 --> 01:29:20.588
CARGO WHENEVER LIKE WE USED TO-

01:29:20.655 --> 01:29:22.056
WE'RE ASKING PEOPLE TO HAVE VERY

01:29:22.123 --> 01:29:24.092
SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE WINDOWS.

01:29:24.158 --> 01:29:25.059
THAT'S VERY FRUSTRATING TO

01:29:25.126 --> 01:29:27.395
EXPORTERS- WE UNDERSTAND IT'S

01:29:27.462 --> 01:29:28.396
FRUSTRATING BUT IT'S THE ONLY

01:29:28.463 --> 01:29:29.630
WAY WE CAN MANAGE LIMITED

01:29:29.697 --> 01:29:32.033
RESOURCE WE HAVE RIGHT NOW- SO

01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:34.068
DATA TRANSPARENCY AND

01:29:34.135 --> 01:29:36.137
COORDINATION THAT RESPECT. FOR

01:29:36.204 --> 01:29:41.843
THE VALUE ADD TO OUR CUSTOMERS.

01:29:41.909 --> 01:29:43.411
NOT SOMETHING WON'T WORK. THAT'S

01:29:43.478 --> 01:29:44.512
THAT'S I'D LIKE TO SEE IS WHAT

01:29:44.579 --> 01:29:46.080
OF ALL. CENTRAL SYSTEM WOULD

01:29:46.147 --> 01:29:51.385
LOOK. THANK AND THE THEY GIVE US

01:29:51.452 --> 01:29:54.622
MATHIS SKIP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

01:29:54.689 --> 01:29:57.258

01:29:59.527 --> 01:30:01.429
ALREADY PRESENTED- I GUESS MY

01:30:01.496 --> 01:30:03.498
QUESTION IS TO- WHOEVER WANTS TO

01:30:03.564 --> 01:30:05.466
ANSWER IT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:30:05.533 --> 01:30:06.567
I THINK THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR

01:30:10.872 --> 01:30:13.508
PROBLEM BUT I ALSO WANT TO HEAR

THOSE OUTSTANDING ISSUES WITH

01:30:34.162 --> 01:30:35.797
THE PLAN THOUGH IT COULD BE

01:30:35.863 --> 01:30:37.965
IMPLEMENTABLE THAT WE CAN LOOK

01:30:38.032 --> 01:30:40.334
FORWARD TO SO FOR THE NEXT

01:30:40.401 --> 01:30:42.837

THE SOLUTION TO THESE PROBLEMS.

01:30:53.681 --> 01:30:56.117
THAT WE CAN NOTE AND THAT WE CAN

RECENT YOU SEE- AB ECONOMICS

SHIPPING CONTAINERS LEAVING

01:34:40.841 --> 01:34:42.843
CALIFORNIA PORTS. ABOUT ONE

01:34:42.910 --> 01:34:44.245
THIRD OF THOSE TYPICALLY CARRY

01:34:44.311 --> 01:34:45.713
CALIFORNIA FARM PRODUCTS SHOWING

01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:47.948
HOW VITAL CONTAINERIZED SHIPPING

01:34:48.015 --> 01:34:50.084
IS TO OUR FARMERS. THE ECONOMICS

01:34:50.151 --> 01:34:52.253
ANALYSIS SHOWS THE SHARE OF

01:34:52.319 --> 01:34:53.487
EMPTY CONTAINERS LEAVING

01:34:53.554 --> 01:34:55.356
CALIFORNIA PORTS BETWEEN MAY AND

01:34:55.423 --> 01:34:57.591
AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WAS

01:34:57.658 --> 01:34:59.260
IT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT. AND HIT

01:34:59.326 --> 01:35:02.430
A RECORD 78% IN SEPTEMBER. THAT

01:35:02.496 --> 01:35:03.497
IS A HUGE PROBLEM BECAUSE THOSE

01:35:03.564 --> 01:35:05.466
EMPTY CONTAINERS ARE NEEDED TO

01:35:05.533 --> 01:35:07.101
EXPORT AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.

01:35:07.168 --> 01:35:09.670

ACCESS TO EXPORT CONTAINERS EVEN

01:35:13.974 --> 01:35:15.709
MORE LIMITED GIVEN THE COSTS ARE

01:35:15.776 --> 01:35:17.745
EXTREMELY HIGH IN NEW FEES HAVE

01:35:17.812 --> 01:35:19.580
BEEN ADDED. THE CONGESTION AND

01:35:19.647 --> 01:35:21.215
EXTREME RATES AND FEES

01:35:21.282 --> 01:35:23.017
INCENTIVIZE THE SHIPPERS TO

01:35:23.084 --> 01:35:24.285
LEAVE CALIFORNIA PORTS WITH

01:35:24.351 --> 01:35:26.720
EMPTY CONTAINERS PARTICULARLY

01:35:26.787 --> 01:35:28.255
AVOIDING THE PORT OF OAKLAND

01:35:28.322 --> 01:35:30.424
ALTOGETHER WE'RE A GREAT DEAL OF

01:35:30.491 --> 01:35:32.460
OURPRODUCT IS EXPORTED FROM.

01:35:32.526 --> 01:35:33.994
THE NUMBER OF VESSELS CALLING O

01:35:34.061 --> 01:35:35.496
THE PORT OF OAKLAND HAS DROPPED

01:35:35.563 --> 01:35:37.665
SIGNIFICANTLY. AND THE AMOUNT OF

01:35:37.731 --> 01:35:39.934
TIME AVAILABLE TO IN GATE HAS

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.869
GONE FROM AVERAGE THREE TO FIVE

01:35:41.936 --> 01:35:43.537
DAYS TO THIS LAST WEEK A VESSEL

OPENED ONLY FOR FOUR HOURS THIS

01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:48.509
PAST WEEK FOR ENGAGING. THE

01:35:48.576 --> 01:35:50.644
SUPPLY CHAIN HAS ALWAYS BEEN A

01:35:50.711 --> 01:35:52.580
COMPLEX BASE TO OPERATE WITHIN.

01:35:52.646 --> 01:35:54.548
HOWEVER WE ARE VERY ALARMED AS

01:35:54.615 --> 01:35:56.450
OUR COSTS ARE SKYROCKETING WITH

01:35:56.517 --> 01:35:58.819
DETENTION AND DEMURRAGE CHARGES

01:35:58.886 --> 01:36:02.490
UP 3100% 60% OF OUR SHIPMENTS

01:36:02.556 --> 01:36:04.158
ARE BEING RESCHEDULED OR

01:36:04.225 --> 01:36:06.894
CANCELED COMPLETELY. WE HAVE

01:36:06.961 --> 01:36:08.762
SEVERAL CONTAINERS THE PAST TWO

01:36:08.829 --> 01:36:10.698
MONTHS WITH CONFIRM BOOKINGS

01:36:10.764 --> 01:36:13.567

ADDITIONAL CHARGES OF OVER FIVE

01:36:19.039 --> 01:36:20.808
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER CONTAINER.

01:36:20.875 --> 01:36:22.376
THESE ARE CHARGES WE CANNOT PASS

01:36:22.443 --> 01:36:24.278
ON TO OUR CUSTOMER BUYER IT'S

01:36:24.345 --> 01:36:25.546
NOT THEIR FAULT THE VESSEL

01:36:25.613 --> 01:36:27.281
DIDN'T PICK UP THE LOAD. AND IT

01:36:27.348 --> 01:36:28.349
OBVIOUSLY IS NOT OUR FAULT

01:36:28.415 --> 01:36:31.352
EITHER BUT WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY

01:36:31.418 --> 01:36:32.353
ZERO RECOURSE WITH THE SHIPPING

01:36:32.419 --> 01:36:33.787

SALES COULD NOT BE COMPLETED

01:36:37.258 --> 01:36:38.025
BECAUSE OF OCEAN CARRIER

01:36:38.092 --> 01:36:40.661
PRACTICES. SUCH AS THE EXCESSIVE

01:36:40.728 --> 01:36:42.062
AND UNREASONABLE BE TENSION TO

01:36:42.129 --> 01:36:43.964
DEMERGE CHARGES. OUTRAGEOUS

01:36:44.031 --> 01:36:44.932
FREIGHT RATES AND NOT

01:36:44.999 --> 01:36:47.468
COMMUNICATING WHICH WAS A BIG

01:36:47.535 --> 01:36:48.202
PART OF THE CONVERSATION

01:36:48.269 --> 01:36:51.472
ALREADY. IN A TIMELY MANNER. AS

CHAIR RIVAS INDICATED BETWEEN

01:36:53.507 --> 01:36:55.242

VALUE OF AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS

01:36:56.877 --> 01:36:58.913

SEVENTEEN PERCENT. AMOUNTING TO

01:37:00.915 --> 01:37:01.916
ABOUT TWO POINT ONE BILLION IN

01:37:01.982 --> 01:37:04.084
LOSSES IN ADDITION TO THAT THE

01:37:04.151 --> 01:37:06.053
CALIFORNIA ALMOND INDUSTRY HAS

01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:07.988
SEEN MASSIVE PRICE DECLINE

01:37:08.055 --> 01:37:10.090
BECAUSE OF EXPORT SHIPMENTS NOT

01:37:10.157 --> 01:37:12.927
SHIPPING AS SCHEDULED. EQUAL TO

01:37:12.993 --> 01:37:15.162
ANOTHER TWO BILLION DOLLARS THIS

01:37:15.229 --> 01:37:17.631
IS MONEY LOST THIS WILL NOT FLOW

01:37:17.698 --> 01:37:19.366
INTO OUR COMMUNITIES. THERE ARE

01:37:19.433 --> 01:37:21.001
ADDITIONAL CONSEQUENCES IT'S

01:37:21.068 --> 01:37:22.903
BEEN DISCUSSED. OUR INDUSTRY

01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:24.104
DEPENDS ON INTERNATIONAL

01:37:24.171 --> 01:37:26.974
HOLIDAYS AND WE CONTINUE TO MISS

01:37:27.041 --> 01:37:28.943
THE SHIPMENT WINDOW TO HIT THOSE

01:37:29.009 --> 01:37:30.778
. THIS LACK OF CERTAINTY IS

01:37:30.844 --> 01:37:32.813
CAUSING UPHEAVAL FOR CALIFORNIA

01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:35.049
ALMOND FARMING FAMILIES AND WE

01:37:35.115 --> 01:37:36.417
ARE NOW WHEN YOU'RE INTO A TIME

01:37:36.483 --> 01:37:37.851
OF HAVING EXTREME CARRY OUT

01:37:37.918 --> 01:37:40.754
LEVELS TO DEAL WITH BECAUSE OF

01:37:40.821 --> 01:37:43.157
MIS SHIPMENTS. ANOTHER EXAMPLE.

01:37:43.224 --> 01:37:44.458
WE CANNOT BILL AN EXPORT

01:37:44.525 --> 01:37:46.227
CUSTOMER WITH WITHOUT HAVING A

01:37:46.293 --> 01:37:49.563
BILL OF LADING. CAN GET A BILL

01:37:49.630 --> 01:37:50.097
OF LADING UNTIL CONTAINERS

01:37:50.164 --> 01:37:52.600
LOADED ON A SHIP. SO EVERY TIME

01:37:52.666 --> 01:37:55.169
WE HAVE A VESSEL DELAYED IN

01:37:55.236 --> 01:37:57.104
CONTAINERS THAT ARE DELAYED FOR

01:37:57.171 --> 01:37:58.839
LOADING WHERE THIS THIS

01:37:58.906 --> 01:38:00.107
TRANSLATES INTO HUNDREDS OF

01:38:00.174 --> 01:38:01.709
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND BILLING

01:38:01.775 --> 01:38:04.078
THAT IS DELAYED SIGNIFICANTLY OR

01:38:04.144 --> 01:38:05.546
EVEN CANCELLED. THIS IS

01:38:05.613 --> 01:38:07.881
UNSUSTAINABLE IN THE LONG TERM

01:38:07.948 --> 01:38:09.783
FOR MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

02:21:53.304 --> 02:21:54.472
OKAY I WILL START COULD YOU

02:21:54.539 --> 02:22:00.511
UPGRADE ANY YEAH SO- I THINK I

02:22:00.578 --> 02:22:01.646
WHAT WE'RE DOING IN TERMS THE

02:22:01.713 --> 02:22:03.514
TEMPORARY POP UP THE ART IS ONE

02:22:03.581 --> 02:22:04.749
OF THOSE MEASURES WERE TRYING TO

02:22:04.816 --> 02:22:06.951
ENCOURAGE TO PROVIDE TO SPACE

02:22:07.018 --> 02:22:08.920
THE TIME TO ADDRESS BASIN TIME

02:22:08.987 --> 02:22:12.190
YOU QUIT THAT. TO BOTH- I HAVE

02:22:12.257 --> 02:22:13.892
TO TAKE IT OFF THE DRUM ROLLS TO

02:22:13.958 --> 02:22:15.827
PROBATE TO PROVIDE MORE ROOM AND

02:22:15.894 --> 02:22:18.763
MORE TIME SO THAT- THE-

02:22:18.830 --> 02:22:21.132
SHIPPERS. I CAN SEE THAT THEIR

02:22:21.199 --> 02:22:24.302
CAPACITY THAT THEY CAN MOVE THAT

02:22:24.369 --> 02:22:27.705
. ASK THEN IF THERE WAS A CROWD

02:22:27.772 --> 02:22:28.373
CONDITION AT THE POOL. AND THAT

02:22:28.439 --> 02:22:29.474
WE COMMUTER. IS POPPING UP CUT

02:22:29.540 --> 02:22:32.243
USED THE SHIPPING LINES. TO MAKE

02:22:32.310 --> 02:22:33.845
SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THIS

02:22:33.912 --> 02:22:35.413
IS TO ASSIST THEM. TO MOVE THE

02:22:35.480 --> 02:22:37.348
CONTAINERS FASTER SO THAT

02:22:37.415 --> 02:22:38.750
THEY'RE MORE WILLING TO DO ALL

02:22:38.816 --> 02:22:40.718
AT PORTABLE OAKLAND YOU WANNA

02:22:40.785 --> 02:22:42.487
TAKE THOSE EXPORTS AND FILL THE

02:22:42.553 --> 02:22:44.455
CONTAINERS AND TAKE IT BACK TO

02:22:44.522 --> 02:22:46.190
ASIA. RATHER THAN TRY AND RATHER

02:22:46.257 --> 02:22:47.091
THAN DECIDING BECAUSE THEY DON'T

02:22:47.158 --> 02:22:48.960
WANT TO WAIT TO SIMPLY CALL BACK

02:22:49.027 --> 02:22:51.296
ASIA QUICKLY. SO THAT IS ONE OF

02:22:51.362 --> 02:22:52.597
THOSE HINGS OU CAN DO ON THE

02:22:52.664 --> 02:22:55.033
ILLINOIS SIDE AND ON THAT SIDE.

02:22:55.099 --> 02:22:56.567
TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NO

02:22:56.634 --> 02:22:57.669
CONGESTION NEW INTERNOS AROUND

02:22:57.735 --> 02:22:59.637
QUICKLY SO THAT THE SHIPPING

02:22:59.704 --> 02:23:00.939
LINES DON'T LOSE MONEY I GIVE

02:23:01.005 --> 02:23:06.678
THEIR VIEW. BY WAITING TOO LONG. FOR THE EXPORTS TO BE LOADED.

02:23:06.744 --> 02:23:08.446
YOU'RE FROM POOREST. SO THINK

02:23:08.513 --> 02:23:09.847
IT'S LOGISTIC QUESTION

02:23:09.914 --> 02:23:10.782
IMMEDIATELY GET INTO CONTAINERS

02:23:10.848 --> 02:23:12.650
HERE TO CENTRAL VALLEY. WHERE

02:23:12.717 --> 02:23:13.751
THE COMMODITY IS WHERE THE ACT

02:23:13.818 --> 02:23:15.286
COMMODITY IS. NOT GETTING A

02:23:15.353 --> 02:23:17.288
LOADED HERE AND THEN GETTING

02:23:17.355 --> 02:23:19.157
THEM TO REALIZE THAT WE CAN'T

02:23:19.223 --> 02:23:21.559
SEND THIS- THE CONTAINERS

02:23:21.626 --> 02:23:23.261
OUTBOUND. FROM THE PORT OF

02:23:23.328 --> 02:23:25.029
STOCKTON- SMALLER BATCH SO

02:23:25.096 --> 02:23:27.265
OBVIOUSLY- AND THAT WAY WE CAN

02:23:27.332 --> 02:23:29.267
ALLEVIATE THE TRAFFIC FLOW ON ON

02:23:29.334 --> 02:23:30.435
FIVE EIGHTY BUT REALLY THAT THE

02:23:30.501 --> 02:23:31.703
ISSUE FOR US I THINK IS. THE

02:23:31.769 --> 02:23:33.905
AVAILABILITY OF EMPTY CONTAINERS

02:23:33.972 --> 02:23:37.008
AFTER AT THE SOURCE OF THE

02:23:37.075 --> 02:23:38.242
ORIGIN. SO IF I CAN ASK ONE LAST

02:23:38.309 --> 02:23:40.011
QUESTION IN IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU

02:23:40.078 --> 02:23:40.945
GUYS ARE EXPERIENCING WHAT IT

02:23:41.012 --> 02:23:43.147
MAKES SENSE THEN TO. I KNOW

02:23:43.214 --> 02:23:43.982
THERE WAS DISCUSSIONS IN THE

02:23:44.048 --> 02:23:45.616
LAST QUARTER WE HAD ABOUT

02:23:45.683 --> 02:23:48.119
IDENTIFYING OTHER. INLAND PORTS

02:23:48.186 --> 02:23:49.721
OR INLAND FACILITIES TO KIND OF

02:23:49.787 --> 02:23:51.689
RELIEVE PRESSURE- WHICH OF

02:23:51.756 --> 02:23:53.558
COURSE YOU'RE DOING- IT IT SEEMS

02:23:53.625 --> 02:23:55.893
LIKE IN THE- BORDER STOCKTON

02:23:55.960 --> 02:23:58.396
WITH WHAT WAS ANNOUNCED. SHOULD

02:23:58.463 --> 02:23:59.931
SHOULD THAT BE REPLICATED- IN.

02:23:59.998 --> 02:24:02.333
OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE- YOU

02:24:02.400 --> 02:24:04.869
KNOW BUYING THE POOR IN. SUCH A

02:24:04.936 --> 02:24:07.772
VALLEY OR AND- THEY'LL VALLEY.

02:24:07.839 --> 02:24:09.240
BELIEVING PRESSURE OFF LONG

02:24:09.307 --> 02:24:11.175
BEACH AND LOS ANGELES- YOU KNOW.

02:24:11.242 --> 02:24:13.878
IN THE SHORT TERM WOULD THAT BE.

02:24:13.945 --> 02:24:15.713
SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE-

02:24:15.780 --> 02:24:19.183
YES SO TO- TO FACILITATE

02:24:19.250 --> 02:24:21.786
EVERYTHING. WHY BACK DIRECTORS

02:24:21.853 --> 02:24:23.121
WHOSE IN MY AND JUST TALKING

02:24:23.187 --> 02:24:25.390
ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY IN FACT-

02:24:25.456 --> 02:24:27.025
JUST BETWEEN THE PORT OF OAKLAND

02:24:27.091 --> 02:24:29.394
AND PORT IT- STOCKTON- THERE

02:24:29.460 --> 02:24:31.529
COULD BE SYNERGIES BETWEEN US IF

02:24:31.596 --> 02:24:32.697
WE COULD ESTABLISH THAT RAIL

02:24:32.764 --> 02:24:34.866
LINK BETWEEN THE TWO PORTS. THAT

02:24:34.932 --> 02:24:37.068
CERTAINLY WE COULD- MAKE SURE

02:24:37.135 --> 02:24:39.303
THAT THE US DIRECTOR ISSUE SAYS

02:24:39.370 --> 02:24:40.638
THAT THEY ARE AWARE THERE'S

02:24:40.705 --> 02:24:42.240
DIFFERENT MODES OF. EXPORTING

02:24:42.306 --> 02:24:45.610
THE ABNORMALITIES BUT ALSO- TO

02:24:45.676 --> 02:24:47.745
HAVE RESTOCKED IN SUPPORT

02:24:47.812 --> 02:24:49.213
INTERNS ARE TAKING A RELIEF OFF

02:24:49.280 --> 02:24:51.282
OF THE ROLLS AND HIGHWAYS THIS

02:24:51.349 --> 02:24:52.917
CALL. QUE NO SPACE IN THE INLAND

02:24:52.984 --> 02:24:54.852
PORT CONCEPT SO THAT CERTAINLY

02:24:54.919 --> 02:24:56.487
SOMETHING THAT- WE WOULD HOPE

02:24:56.554 --> 02:24:58.423
THAT HE- THE STATE WOULD HELP US

02:24:58.489 --> 02:25:03.694
INVEST. IN YOU MISTER PRODUCT IS

02:25:03.761 --> 02:25:06.330
THE MACAW HERE. IF YOU KNOW AND

02:25:06.397 --> 02:25:08.499
- WHICH IS THEY IF THE GOAL IS

02:25:08.566 --> 02:25:09.367
TO X. GOODS. RIGHT BE THE

02:25:09.434 --> 02:25:11.069
AGRICULTURAL OR IN PRODUCTS OR

02:25:11.135 --> 02:25:12.470
OTHER BECAUSE LOT OF IT WE'RE

02:25:12.537 --> 02:25:14.005
TALKING A LOT ABOUT TODAY. BUT

02:25:14.072 --> 02:25:15.473
THERE'S A MACHINE READ THIS MAN

02:25:15.540 --> 02:25:17.375
CALIFORNIA AND THE WEST THAT

02:25:17.442 --> 02:25:19.777
ALSO GOES ON OUR PORCH IS A LOT

02:25:19.844 --> 02:25:20.378
THAT THAT'S EXPORT BUT OF THE

02:25:20.445 --> 02:25:22.713
GOAL IS TO. IS TO EXPORT I MEAN

02:25:22.780 --> 02:25:24.749
ENCOURAGE ENCOURAGEMENT IS GOOD

02:25:24.816 --> 02:25:27.118
BUT A POLICY IS BETTER. AND I

02:25:27.185 --> 02:25:28.519
WAS JUST CONVERSING WITH ONE OF

02:25:28.586 --> 02:25:29.921
MY COLLEAGUES HERE WHERE MAYBE

02:25:29.987 --> 02:25:32.156
WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT-

02:25:32.223 --> 02:25:34.225
REQUIRING- INSIDE THE PORT

02:25:34.292 --> 02:25:35.326
CONFERENCE RIGHT THEY SIGNED THE

02:25:35.393 --> 02:25:36.494
LEASE AS THEIR LITTLE THEY ARE

02:25:36.561 --> 02:25:37.662
THEY'RE- THEY'RE- THEY'RE

02:25:37.728 --> 02:25:39.931
LESSORS. THAT WHEN THEY SIGNED

02:25:39.997 --> 02:25:41.466
THEIR LEASES THE PORTS DO WITH

02:25:41.532 --> 02:25:43.334
WITH THE PERSON IS LEASING. THE

02:25:43.401 --> 02:25:45.103
TERMINAL. THAT THEY DO HAVE.

02:25:45.169 --> 02:25:46.871
SOME TYPE OF- EXPORT

02:25:46.938 --> 02:25:48.272
REQUIREMENTS I WOULDN'T WANT TO

02:25:48.339 --> 02:25:50.274
BE TOO PRESCRIPTIVE. I THINK WE

02:25:50.341 --> 02:25:51.409
NEED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT THAT

02:25:51.476 --> 02:25:53.211
AND TO HAVE A LOT OF INPUT IS

02:25:53.277 --> 02:25:54.245
WHETHER OR NOT THAT BUT IT WOULD

02:25:54.312 --> 02:25:56.013
BE WISE BUT IT MIGHT BE

02:25:56.080 --> 02:25:57.081
SOMETHING WE SHOULD THINK OF.

02:25:57.148 --> 02:25:58.649
WEARING AGAIN- THERE IS SOME

02:25:58.716 --> 02:26:01.052
ONUS ON SOME LEVERAGE. ON THE

02:26:01.119 --> 02:26:04.288
TERMINAL OPERATORS TO HAVE- IN

02:26:04.355 --> 02:26:06.290
EXPORT COMPONENT. AND I DON'T

02:26:06.357 --> 02:26:07.525
KNOW HOW THAT WOULD LARA YOU

02:26:07.592 --> 02:26:09.927
NEED TO BE CAREFUL- THE WEEDY

02:26:09.994 --> 02:26:12.730
AGAIN WE DON'T WANT TO COMMAND-

02:26:12.797 --> 02:26:13.731
THE TERMINALS TO DO ANYTHING

02:26:13.798 --> 02:26:15.032
BECAUSE LEGALLY THAT PROBABLY

02:26:15.099 --> 02:26:15.933
WOULDN'T HOLD UP ANYWAYS IS

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:17.735
INTERSTATE COMMERCE A LOT. AND

02:26:17.802 --> 02:26:18.836
IS A PRIVATE RELATIONSHIPS WE

02:26:18.903 --> 02:26:19.937
DON'T WANT TO DELVE INTO THAT

02:26:20.004 --> 02:26:21.305
TOO MUCH. BUT AGAIN IT MIGHT BE

02:26:21.372 --> 02:26:23.908
SOMETHING TO DO SO THAT WE CAN

02:26:23.975 --> 02:26:26.511
LEVERAGE. IN ORDER TO GET. MORE

02:26:26.577 --> 02:26:28.045
MORE EXPORTS BECAUSE PORT SIDE

PLAY ITSELF OUT SO. I CERTAINLY

02:26:54.972 --> 02:26:56.040
