And respectful of your time because I know you all students and somebody has an exam in the morning- if it's if it's true to form- so I wanted to take this opportunity up. As we begin I want to thank the UC Berkeley's. AS UC's governing body. Best of vasha and Maureen. And all the hard working students and student organizations that have helped to make this hearing happen. In addition I'd like to thank the chancellor Carol Chris who's here and her staff. For allowing me to hold the assembly select committee on campus climate here UC Berkeley. I am assembly member Shirley Weber I represent the seventy ninth assembly district which is in San Diego.

And to have this hearing here- I also want to stay in appreciation to the panelist. Who took the time from their busy busy schedule today to show important information. About important issues occurring on college and university campuses. And I wanna thank them for coming to this this hearing. This evening after a long day of work and activity. I want take his time not to introduce UC Berkeley's chancellor Carol Chris Ste Christ. Who I understand has left a meeting to join us.

Hi good evening everyone and welcome to UC Berkeley I'm so pleased to have assembly member Shirley Weber here at UC Berkeley for this hearing. I want to personally thank her for her leadership. On this important topic of campus climate. The work of the select committee on campus climate continues to be of great value. Giving voice to our students and holding colleges and universities accountable. In building support of an inclusive campus environments. I also want to welcome our local assembly member Buffy wicks Buffy is in a great champion for our campus and for higher education. Entities more broadly and her short time in the assembly and we greatly appreciate her support thank you for being here. Our vice chancellor of equity inclusion Oscar to bone. Will provide an update on the steps that we've been taking to approve our campus climate later in this hearing. Although I believe that we are making progress on these issues. Must also acknowledge that many challenges persist after years of systemic marginal Asian. We've got your- thing and respectful campus climate. And bill isn't in France foundation. For the realization of our values of academic excellence it accepts. However. On staff to divert every sort cannot be fully realized when individuals are marginalized due to their origins outlook store orientations it's our responsibility to prepare our students to fully engage in a world defined by difference and diversity and to provide a safe and welcoming community for all. Last year we launched a comprehensive undergraduate student diversity project at Berkeley. The projects goal was to provide the analysis necessary both to expand diversity within the student body and to improve the campus experience for those groups and communities that have historically been under represented or marginalized in higher education. The effort yielded a set of recommendations the challenge us to reexamine arm to just to young people and their families and communities as well as our overall intentions process sees alignment and culture. The recommendations also make it clear that we must strive for equity of experience for every student our campus. Builder torture of belonging and identify ways to highlight those from under represented and marginalized groups as contributors and co constructors of our university. These efforts which price per chancellor to bone will talk about in more detail. Are necessary for us to remain a top teaching and research institution. An essential for us to truly meet our universities public mandate. Thank you again for being here today. Doctor Weber I sincerely appreciate your interest in bringing this dialogue to the campus so that we can hear from our students and continue to improve our efforts in making our communities a safe and welcoming as possible so that our students can thrive. Thank you thank you- want to thank the chancellor for coming for being here and the weed I know we've been trying to get to Berkeley for the last five years and somehow another is always been something going on or something that intervenes and prevents us for coming so we were determined this year to do that. This come this commission of this select committee is one of the oldest select committees in the assembly that is still functioning. Created in two thousand fourteen. This marks the fifth year of the select committee on campus climate. I'm and I Xin is to ensure that the state's college campuses are safe welcoming environment for all students. Five you traveled up and down the state of California hosting hearings at different colleges. Listening to diversity experts civil rights groups and students to gain insight and generate policy recommendations to improve the campus climate. Of the state's community colleges cal state university and the UC system's. We've covered a range of topics from campus sexual assault and violence to hunger and homelessness among college students. And we have a lot more to explore. This committee has authored numerous pieces of legislation that have passed and have made a difference across the campus is particularly. In the area of homelessness and food in securities. Higher education for many of our young people learn and examine the world in which we it happen. In the near future students from the UCC issues in the community colleges will be setting the climate. Not only for their campuses but for the entire state of California. It was interesting when we began this- this this- committee this hearing the select committee. I was asked to chair the committee because- at the time of those are speaker Mister pet issues now the chair of the regions- we had an incident at San Jose state. And we he was greatly concerned that we did not have proper response to instead. He looked around and he decided that I would. Yeah he called me actually doing one of a to the holiday break. And asked me to chair of this committee of the select committee and he said because he looked around and he realized that of all the members on the assembly. And the Senate that I was one we have the longest record in higher education having been a professor at San Diego state forty years. And a chair of a department on and off of probably thirty years that I can understood the campus climate the campus community. And could probably pull together some things that were important in addressing it. Of the legislature in I'd not only see that this is not just a discussion of the day. But in investment in tomorrow. When we first began this someone said well the problem reason we were having at at that particular time was because- students come from so many places across the state. And they meet at our university campuses and so it almost looks like so therefore the campus climate keeps changing because of the students that of the year. My response was that our campuses are not. Just are not thermostats I mean they're not the monitors they don't just measure the climate they determine the climate we have thermostats. And we gonna so where students come from we have to have a set of standards that we- expect for every student on this campus at the parents who send their children to us. Should expect a campus that we control. That will provide safe. And welcoming experiences for every student regardless of where they came from. And so we're not here just to measure what's happening we're here to talk about how do we determine. The kind of the environment and spirit that needs to be on every campus- as we continue to grow. As a system- would be a become then will become increasingly diverse. I student needs. To feel safe when I campus and knowledgeable about campus procedures policies and services. This select committee as I said was formed in nineteen in twenty fourteen. Because of what was happening at San Jose. In that could have happened on any campus at that particular time. And that it was not fostering and building a positive campus climate. Unfortunately symbols of hate offensive hate speech in acts of intimidation have continued to be on a steady incline in the last four years. According to the data released by the anti defamation league. There has been a 77% increase across the nation of white supremacist propaganda distribution on college campuses. For twenty eighteen nineteen the academic year California have the most incidents with fifty eight incidents of extremist propaganda. Followed by Kentucky with twenty two in Oklahoma with nineteen. I think that shocks most. Because normally people think of California. As this place of tremendous diversity liberal thinking of people working together because that's the image that we have. But as we have begun to delve deeper into the activities that happen in California- we realize that this is a place that has tremendous issues of race. And gender- and religion across the board in terms of division that's the year. Some of you are familiar with AB three nine to our rates are bill dealing with police up- use of force and one of the driving forces was a California has the highest number. Of deaths of done by police are still on armed individuals in the nation that was shocking to. Because we- think that it's an out family or Mississippi but it was in California. And so there's some things California to come and grapple with and we have the leaders. Taking the charge of changing the elements that it. The again the math is right. White premises language to explicitly racist images and will. Often include a recruitment element and frequently expects minority including people Muslims nonwhite immigrants in the LGBT community. Oftentimes college campuses in their community should be places for learning and growing and the future and not close minded racism and hate Phil rhetoric from the past. But races incidents are not limited to the all right segment we continue to see lack of cultural competency within our general campus cult culture. Nooses students in black face and this table called cultural appropriate appropriations a continue to be seen frequently throughout our California campuses- I'm not a big football fan but last night I once again saw the black cat. Run across the feel during the- I guess it was the Dallas Cowboys game and some people all that's not important but it reached back of. Jackie Robinson in the nineteen forties when they put a black cat on the baseball field to intimidate him- and for people may not see it happens once again the thinking of those who would do such an act. That is the episode reminds us of something never. Seem to dial. Up we see this by this incident and at some. Of the new series the distasteful a black face the culture appropriate in an activities that occur. We see the response of these appropriate incidents as just as important as the work being done to prevent these incidents from occurring. The leadership of our institutions of higher learning and their diversity composition is also critical to the progress of campus climate. I know we could not completely solve all campus climate incidents the wealth California. But we can surely work to lower the frequency of the numbers of these campus climate incidents and we surely can raise our level of intolerance. It is our hope that these hearings provide greater insight to discover what's working what's not how we can improve and if possible implement and standardize some of the best practices. I want to say up front that this is not a meeting this nine two lamb passed any particular campus law of that's that's in the state. However the objective. Of this hearing is to disclose what's occurring on campus. Campus how these incidents are being handle and to find solutions to improve outcomes. Simply because we're here at Berkeley doesn't mean Berkeley has more problems than UC San Diego I can tell you it doesn't- but we're here because we want to make the hearings acceptable to people throughout the state. And to hear from all the various campuses as to what they're doing to address these issues- today as a chance to learn about the work being done naturally around campus climate. Here from student voices and explore how California's higher education segments are responding to and combating the rise of hate. We also have a chance to follow up in here from the UC see issues in the community colleges about the progress they've made one their comedic on the campuses. And committees formulated policy recommendations from twenty fourteen to we also is a check up to see what we have done. In the last five years- at this time I want to give an opportunity for my- colleagues to. Make comments assembly member wicks who is from this area. And I welcome. And given opportunity to give you see welcome. I don't think Baker costs such a rock I now sorry. Hi everyone I just wanted to come in welcome everyone to this conversation and welcome my colleague Dr Shirley Weber at to the gorgeous wonderful UC Berkeley thank you for coming to visit I want to thank the UC for hosting this and thank the chancellor for- for being here you know- I started Weber described we've seen an increase in white supremacist propaganda. We've seen an increase in hate crimes across this country you look at- information from the anti defamation league to the Southern Poverty Law Center to the ACLU organizations that are dedicated to tracking and combating the stuff and- now more than ever any this conversation. You know we've seen this increase and frankly. Our races president gives license to it. You know and so that makes it incumbent upon the rest of us at all levels of government in this state and across this country and those of you in this room to actively call it out. And push back on it and take action on this it's I think were in a really critical moment right now in our nation's history. On this issue in particular. Ought to this right and- what these types of visits is due- but it's- more important now than ever and so how do we address it. You know it's- up shining a spotlight on it it's a having public forms it's having the dialogue around it. And then it's about taking action and what we're really talking about here is someone comfortable truth. That we really need to look in the mirror as society. And talk about these uncomfortable truths and I will say. And there's no one more better equipped in the state legislature. To drive the conversation about uncomfortable truths. The doctor show it was Shirley Weber. And you know I've been in the legislature for a year now and we have some great colleagues there some very smart people. Who work incredibly hard- but watching hurt navigate. The bill around police use of force- it was pretty amazing and that was about on. Double truths. We give Shirley Weber around applause for that. And so you're all good hands here with her leadership on the conversation but I also want to say- what's also critical as your voice. And that's why I think these former so important to do across the state your voice in this conversation is very very important we have to bring together all stakeholders if we really want to address this is it so that includes you I want to thank you all for being here every student deserves. A safe learning environment. And we can stop of nothing short than that. So that's what our goal is that's what the aim is- thank you all I just want to come give welcoming remarks thank you for having this UC Berkeley thank you for posting it. Thank you thank you so member wicks. What to begin this conversation and- they what they what they're going to want to sit and listen to you- wanna begin the conversation with an expert who we have with us today- I want to welcome our special guest. Dr Charles. H. F. Davis the bird. Who is the chief strategy officer of the use university of southern California. Race in equity center. He will be providing us with an overview of the work the center does nationally around address assessing campus climate. And racial equity. Dr Charles Davis thank you for being here with us this evening and sharing this information thank you. Greetings madam chair. Members of the select committee in all those here in the audience attending. Thank you for the opportunity an invitation to join you this evening to discuss issues of campus racial climate and our work in relation to these issues at the U. S. C. race and equity center. The USA race in equity center was established in twenty seventeen at the university of southern California. Primarily is an interdisciplinary research organization dedicated to identifying racial inequities. Prescribing evidence based interventions for the end of racial justice. Center strength primarily lies in its interdisciplinary which brings together scholars and researchers across various fields and disciplines to address issues of race and racism within post secondary institutions as well as broader society. I currently have the pleasure of serving as the center's chief strategy officer and director of research. In which I support each of our centers primary portfolios of work to include assessment and evaluation. To learn an organizational development and a global hiring. Today have been asked to speak specifically about our work in assessing inequities in student success and soon experience because universities across the nation with in the state. So please accept this following testimony is my best efforts to do so. Earlier this year the center published its fifty state report card which examined- academic year twenty sixteen and twenty seventeen access and equity indicators for black undergraduates at five hundred sixty four year non specialized public post secondary institutions in the United States. Data were driving to specific federal sources the first the U. S. census American community survey. And secondly the US department educations integrated postsecondary education data system. Using these data the report specifically assessed for indicators racial representation inter racial gender equity completion equity and black students to faculty ratios. My representation equity we were talking about- determining the calculation of difference between the percent of black undergraduates at a specific institution and the percent of college age like residents within the state. With regard to gender equity we were determining- through the measures of enrollment gaps between black undergraduate men in black undergraduate women relative to the overall enrollment gaps of all women in all men across racial and ethnic groups. And institutions with any particular state. With about to completion accordion we assess the differences between the average six year graduation rates for cohorts of black undergraduate students and for cohorts of undergraduate students overall. And for black students to faculty ratios we determined- the number of full time degree seeking black undergraduates to full time black instructional faculty. Letter grades were then calculated for each indicator using a Quintel distribution and what's the top remaining letter grades within distributed evenly enforce and warding letter grades for the for equity indicators we calculated an equity index score for each institution that was the equivalent of a grade point average. And so it's customary in the same fashion we do here because in universities. Encountering GPAs we assign four points for in a three for a bi to for a C. and one for a day. Then averages some of those indicator grades to determine the index score. In in to determine the state and that's where we average the sum of all institutional index scores within a given state calculated. The average equity index score across all the five hundred six public institutions was two point zero two. No campus aren't above a three point five. And two hundred housing overseas earned scores below two point zero. And institutional level you see San Diego cal state Monterey Bay cal state Fresno and UC riverside were all located amongst the top thirty five individual institutions nationally. With index for the three point oh or better. The state of California receiving the next work two point four six ranking it third amongst all states in the nation. However it to be sure such ratings and rankings are wholly contextual in relation to all institutions assess. Disturbing grades in quintiles Evelyn required us to provide Asian bees to some institutions that actually performed poorly. Relatively not as bad as the remaining three fifths of institutions in the whole study. Differently our calculations as he would say and students sometimes appreciate is graded on a curve. It's going grading on a curve we attempted to make clear that scores not necessarily reflect or indicate blacks in equity. For example while the score two point four six ranks California most the highest performing in our study. It's a reflects a C. average black student equity in their forty man significan improves the made especially at the remaining twenty seven institutions. It's going below two point seven five. Additionally in a separate report published by the center that examine racial inequities among black male student athletes and see double a division one power five conferences. Which cal Berkeley UCLA. And USC and Stanford were included. What the report evidence is that there disparities in graduation rates months black student athletes which were abysmally low in all cases except for Stanford. Which were objectively high. I find this particular important to notice California recently led the nation in deciding to allow athletes to earn income off of their likeness to endorsements which is most relevant to those in revenue generating sports such as football and men's basketball what's the overwhelming majority are comprised of black men. It's to evidence in a report. In which definition institutions and roll black male. Students at a rate equal to or less than 3% of all students. Well black men comprise. Between thirty and basketball teams. In this is reported by both said he's only measure specific quantifiable outcomes with which each report was concerned. And although they may reflect in some way. The environment within which black students live work and learn the do not comprehensively assess factors most commonly associated with campus racial climate. And therefore for their in different assessments are essential to understanding the relation between post secondary environments their social context is to experiences and for this reason the center together. With a panel of more than fifty nationally recognized experts on campus racism survey methodologies and college students develop the national assessment for Klay just campus climates. Unlike other assessments the neck takes intentionally narrow approach to isolate racism of the phenomena under study. Based on our previous centers decade of work on campus climate we learn that broader recesses often fail to provide the necessary death to dress in one of the nation's most intractable problems. What is more racism routinely is pushed further into the margins by and areas subsumed under the contested and under specified banner of diversity equity inclusion. In the wake of the rising tide of white supremacy on college university campuses and elsewhere within broader society. We thought it important to restrict our assessment to the deep study of race and racism. The survey administered to all students within a particular- participating college university. And the necklace is perspectives on the ways students perceive experience the campus racial climate. More specifically the knack is designed to not address whether racism is present in an institution. In fact it is designed to help institutions identified the various ways that institutional structural interpersonal racism manifests. The service comprised of sixty five separate items across five primary content areas the five being battering affirmation racial learning and literacy. Across racial engagement encounters with racial stress appraisals of institutional commitment and the impact of external environments. Currently he's content area scored using racially disaggregated metrics from select blocks a survey items with any particular domain and their assigned ratings one through four. And again we thought this important because often we have the data reported it often just opposes white students with everyone else and so we thought it wasn't too just aggravates we can understand the specific experiences of individualized racial ethnic groups. During the twenty eighteen twenty nineteen academic year which is our pilot your for the knack we successfully administer the survey nationally to more than two hundred thousand students. Including those it eight two year and four year post secondary institutions within the state of which the university of southern California in those other institutions here today are represented. While attending national St report of our data is still being developed. I can share with you that our findings were consistent with decades of research on campus racial climate. Secular between white students and students of color broadly were found in every single content area some of which were more pronounced between specific racial ethnic groups and their white peers for example our findings among the California schools routinely show gaps in cross racial engagement that is that students of color generally were both more likely and more open to engaging in conversations about race with white students than white students were with their students of color peers. This finding indicates a need for college universities to consider interventions that better. Excuse me. Requires and to consider intervention the better prepare white students to not only voluntarily engage across racial difference. What to do so around issues of race and racism in ways to communicate and understanding of their own privileged positions within institutions and society. Primarily governed by powerful white people and white supremacist ideologies. Further our findings indicate in under represent underestimation of racial minority students encounters with racism by white students. In particular yes something put forward by many white students within our assessment tools that racially- CD raising my north high students experience instances of racism in the classroom on campus. I rates far lower than self reported by them. These about a few examples including the reporting bar data from our participating institutions. Each of which is provided an individual and relatively confidential report. However I want to focus for a moment again on the external factors associated with campus climate. Forge relatively little research has been conducted. In the current socio political climate. Which campus season which is relatively dormant in comparison to those in years during Emily following the election of Donald trump's the presidency of the United States. In this is a campus racial violence of spite. According to a forthcoming study led by size Stokes who joins me today is a research associate with our center. A multi year data analysis shows dramatic increases in races verbal and physical attacks on college campuses. Specifically this study examines over three hundred fifty reports from higher education new sites between twenty thirteen and twenty eighteen. Between twenty thirteen to twenty fifteen specifically an annual average of twenty seven incidents occurred. However we sixteen alone a high in nineteen incidents were reported. Yielding a 3100% increase the year prior. Overall nearly two with. Of all reported incidents were violence against black students specifically at white universities. Additionally two hundred nineteen of three hundred fifty acts of racial violence were patch waited by white people. With another one hundred twenty perpetrators being on now. It's still. Soon lives are not limited to this the college university campuses and often traverse the boundaries between town and gown this post new questions regarding the safety a racing mind or t&lt;c.cyan&gt; students in&lt;/c&gt; trying to communities. Within which post secondary institutions are situated. The comedian out look any further for cases been within the state. There is the presence of recruitment fire's post about white supremacist groups which California leads. Or the anti semitic anti black and if I can look at goes along dorm walls around the frequent presence is of hate speech disguises the democratic debate of ideas. But these phenomena in fact are present across the UC CSU a community college system. And the name graver circumstances. What students are rendered immediately vulnerable the moment they leave campus. In ways entirely more violent than those reported on campus. For example that is considered Humboldt state university here in northern California. That there. They're in city of Arcadia on April fifteenth. Twenty seventeen David is I lost in a black student at humble state was stabbed to death and all. After being stabbed a size friend fellow student ID channel begin administering CPR while white people at the scene reported citing said and I quote. I wish the **** does die. I really hope that **** dies. More police officers and other emergency medical personnel arrived at the scene it is reported that they failed to administer lifesaving aid their different relator wasn't dysfunction at officers further. To detain and question any witnesses. A twenty four year old white man from McKinley bill city nearby was later arrested and indicted but the case was later dismissed by humble county Superior Court judge. What is more the six. Thousand dollar payment to the national police foundation to review a PT's conduct in the case is yet to deliver its report. On the incident more than two years later. And all the while. Charmaine Lawson. Decides whether has been left without answers and without her son. And to be completely sure. Justice is not the furniture report or civil settlement for grieving mother. Justice it's just I Los and still being here. And so with that I again would like to thank you for the time. Madam chair and your the rest my time for any questions. I think you in your report you indicated that. That the you know you have a time frame of the accident so- some folks would say that it started twenty sixteen others will say it started much earlier. What's your assessment. I in terms of the races incident happening yes- my assessment is that these things have and will continue to happen we know that from the integration of. Secular institutions in the south up until today- that campus racial violence is a very real part of what people are experiencing. And so although we may have seen a spike in those incidents that are reported that does not mean that they weren't happening in the same volume earlier on- but in fact we have. Can isn't by which we can report these things when they do take place- we also have press who in their sensationalized. To review of the way the world works also want to be able to- monetize some of the cliques by reporting on these incidents more frequently. Have you seen any campus that's been very successful in dealing with it in my experience I have not. I think many campuses are always already ill prepared to respond. Any particular moments. And that is being evidence so simply by students who are taking a part of our survey. Them often say that if there is ever a response it is only when tragedy strikes or crisis arises. But there is not really preventive measures are being taken into account. I'm even more so- that means to show leaders are falling back on policies that do not account for the way the campus racism functions. To say that they cannot intervene. They must yield to. What they perceived to be. A constitutional right. Again to engage in what is considered free speech although it takes me to deeply impacted campus racial climate. Thank you very much thank you there may be some questions or comments after. At the end one of thank you with at this time we're going to call our first panel for work this is a- the students perspective on the panel. I want to introduce our first pound each presenter will have seven minutes of testimony will come forward. And at the east end of each panel we will allow ten minutes. For questions from me and I and maybe Mrs Skinner she peers- and at the close of second panel public comments will be taken from the audience so there will be an opportunity. For public comment so will be after the two panels. This is our student panel. That we have here today. And I'm not sure if you do you guys have a preference in in water art is the order that we have here sufficient. Okay. First student is going to be a long road Garcia the vice president of external affairs and San Francisco state. Of followed by a studio khn who is the move some students association west- she's a transfer student who attends sambar Dino valley college and now. Tend UC Berkeley- the next to will be Dominic Williams the former chair of racial justice now USA- the fourth June will be marines summons the eternal chair of police oversight here a AS you see. And lastly we're truly Natalie's. Ahmed mu how did. Who is the president of UC Berkeley's in double A. C. P. chapter welcome and we look forward to hearing from you. Who's our timer. Okay here's a signs okay but time thank you so everyone knows. Who are timers thank you very much will begin. With the laundry. The song okay yes- hello everyone I'm a long dress cable Garcia I'm the vice president external affairs first issued students at San Francisco state and also a director for the cal state student association I'm currently thirty year at Sam Cisco state double majoring in political science and Reyes resistance studies. I would like to give my knowledge mint the every call State University is diverse and different in its own way we operate in different locations Sir different types of students over all under the same system the CSU system a part of the mission for public universities including the CSU is to support a learning environment that promotes and protects- through through. Exchange of diverse ideas I Sam Cisco state we've established division of equity income inclusion in twenty seventeen within the vision we've established a black unity center in Asian American Pacific Islander student services center a dream resource center. And starting next year hopefully will. Have a lot an accident center and a pride center. Hopefully act. As a state is one of the first public universities who's hired staff to focus on student interface- programming they've higher sausages of us the Jewish student life coordinator. And Serena he's a little grew as the Muslims to real life coordinator. They have ensured proper anti bias ally ship in training to be hold for students faculty and staff which I have personally taken and- he did an- as the state continues to. Help students feel comfortable and safe and which I have of. Well as well armed with all the services and trainings they have been offering even though there's a lot of amazing programming and services being offered for students in the CSU system. There's still some racial biases and hateful incidents happening in our institutions. This summer us of state campus there is anti semitic messaging in our bathrooms as far as promoting xenophobia. I get students and faculty members- last semester we've had several students who identified of white supremacy king ethnic studies courses questioning- faculty of. Walking around faculty and students. I cal state Fullerton recently they've dealt with the uses of the way Edward on flyers from student organizations on campus. I called a police low recently had students host a gathering the end illegal aliens versus cowboys I constantly ask myself why racial Hippel incidents are still continuing or campuses. Are universities need to be trying hard to ensure students are feeling safe and to hold students staff and faculty accountable. For the racial and hateful incident that we participate in. I'm deeply concerned for students safety in the twenty twenty presidential elections during presidential late elections he crimes usually go up in twenty seventeen the department of justice have reported that ten point 5% of. He crimes occurred on college campuses being a public university we're bound to be in an open campus as well in an open campus insurers freedom of speech is Matt. Will also ensures the outside groups can come onto our campus improvement he'd speech against our students. We the university in all stakeholders such as a so should students and academics and as of universities you to provide safe spaces for students and have open forms to have these conversations. I know so citizens on my campus is the official voice of students but we have students are in privileged positions. That need to be reaching out to students and holding administrators accountable when he for racial bias incidents occur. Instead of using or cities being reactive when incidents occurred we need to be more proactive in prevent these incidents from happening in the first place. I would like to think assembly member Weber for competing the panel and for hearing on students perspectives on racial. And hateful bias incidents thank you thank you. Hello sorry guys. Are good evening and thank you doctor Weber members of the subcommittee for hosting this important hearing. And to the Berkeley student organizations for helping to put this event together my name is audio con. And I'm a senior transfer at UC Berkeley I a formerly attended summer and you know Valley college- and during my time but that Berkeley and SPV see I've held various leadership roles in an effort to uplift. Marginalized communities like my own Intel crazy for and campus environments for all students. However today I'm here as a student leader from MSE west aye nonprofit organization that works with thousands of Muslim students across- various campuses to provide. Programs resources into is just support the social- emotional and spiritual needs of more some students across California- we believe that creating a- safe campus environment for all students meets having culturally competent staff an admin. Working together with community to develop structural solutions to the many challenges students are experiencing. Today I am here to talk about the often overlooked perspective which is that of the Muslim community. We are one of the most diverse communities with no singular racial ethnic or identity background that can you know cap the intersections of our experiences. However are some of the most common challenges that we face. Come from us some of the student perspectives which- students experiences at the UC CSU in committee college level. Basically lack any data on our community- most public institutions have very little data. Are specific to the most some identity or when there are attempts to capture this information it is usually. Only used aren't Africa south Asian groups which will is a step forward excludes significant portions of most of student community that clued. But not limited to black là next southeast Asian and white most some students- because of this lack of data as a west partner. Institutions on social policy and understanding to conduct an initial large skilled research study on. I'm going to some sort of population that analyzes the population's needs holistically- this past January you we collected data from over five hundred students and this. Search basically found in various forms of discrimination- in whether it was political community engagement identity wise- there was a lot of discrimination that our students are facing and I wanted to share some of that with you guys today- according to the research that we did we found that 63% of Muslim student respondents- reported facing some level of religious discrimination in the past year. And fourteen point reported facing religious discrimination on campus from professors in the past year with woman reporting a higher rate than men- I personally experienced many such incidents including my very first semester summer do you know Valley college right. A mandatory cool history course where. In the first week of class my professor presented very Islamophobic talking points to the entire class- he claimed that Muslims forced women to dress a certain way that Muslims abused women that we worshipped. A moon god and we refuse to move forward. The rest of the world and we were stuck in medieval and backwards mentality. As the first week like very early during my first week of college. How do not experience it was completely horrifying and quite honestly it was extremely intimidating because here is somebody that is supposed to be- providing us with. Information and yet he is turned down my identity and who I am as a person. And to watch my peers take that in as fast as truth is honestly very hurtful and- eventually led to me. Doing extremely bottom not class I ended up not being able to engage with my peers or my professor. Because this was extremely triggering to past experiences that I had of verbal and physical abuse because of you know some of the big rhetoric. And so you know not having any adequate support or resources from the campus to navigate the situation I ultimately feel that course- again you know I had a similar experience was a of course. World. My professor use a text book by in a slump phobic Asama phobic non most some who basically portrayed Asama as that backwards religion and just. You know pretty much toward on my identity as a Muslim and created a very hostile environment for myself especially when my peers are taking all this information in and seeing it as fact and that is how they are engaging with me after you know seeing that information- according to some of the- research study that we did. You know a lot of our students. Reported that even with administration they are unable to report these issues or that they don't feel like reporting these issues will be affected to our administration our survey found that 10% of the respondents who. Reported facing religious discrimination on campus are actually face that from administration as well so- which is extremely high number to face the disk to Fuhrman ministration considering most students don't usually interact with administration- campus climate is affected by a number of factors. But most significantly it also includes our peers and being out of school like UC Berkeley you all are Sir found that 31% of most in college and in California reported facing religious discrimination from their peers on their call campuses other at Berkeley you know we see that with. When our hello here's our you know holding. Out. In guest speakers who are actually renowned renowned. When students in our classroom discussions are echoing the dangerous rhetoric that vilify just Pham or 181% of most of students who have been approached. To exponent splaine controversial topics about it. This indicates collectively- instead these incidents collectively contribute to a hostile climate that impacts all aspects of our lives including our ability to learn and thrive on campus- in addition to the over discrimination on campus is one of the most pressing issues faced by the most of students on campus recently has been the surge of surveillance programs. Primarily impacting most someone box to dance in the past few years have been- counter violent extremism programs being implemented on college campuses across California- CVS the department of homeland security program that began in two thousand and eleven. To address rider station in America by targeting the Muslim community through a national security framework that firms Muslims especially youth has been prone to radicalization. Initially CV programs took the form of grants for DHS to target cities across the nation meant to distribute community organizations. To minority most some communities. And report the information back to the federal government sick of time tonight I cannot go into further the full scope of CVS and its impact on the most and community brought for the purpose of this hearing. I would like to highlight that recently we have seen TV programs surfacing on campuses across California including. UC Berkeley UCLA UC Irvine casting summoned you know and more. These often take place in the shape of professors research on course works on campuses. With one enforcement and federal agencies to create programs and produce research on terrorism counter by. Counter terrorism and violent extremism that targets does that they believe are the biggest risk. Being Muslims. These types of programs create paranoia and distrust and hostile environments for those were the targets of surveillance. And have long lasting impacts on already vulnerable communities the most of community has been subject to unwarranted. Surveillance for decades especially post nine eleven and the uptake of CV programs throughout the community and now on campuses in particularly concerning for the safety of most well being of my some students I am only touch on the surface of this. Here on the explanation and impact of these programs and we would be interested in following up conversations with folks from the legislature. And from- campus system discuss the topic and impact it has on the well being of students- all in all I would just like to say that the most of students you know are facing a variety of challenges- and we would love to. Have you know further discussion on these are topics and we would love to share the MSA west report with both the campus community as well as the legislature. To discuss these topics further and to follow up and have for the conversation on these- and with that I would like to thank the- committee chair for hope. Having us I think they are you thank you. Our next speaker is the dumbest Dominic. So I thank chairman Weber and the committee for having the speech you all today in having your hearing at UC Berkeley- the worst you see for black students according to the U. S. he said he release this year and according to black students for a while now. My name is Dominique Williams and I am a graduating senior at cal and I'm the first in my family to go to college. I've been intimately involved in California higher education policy for the last four years as an advocate in our campuses student government. Meeting with state legislators to communicate soon issues directly to the years of Sacramento. Also when I think doctor Weber for passing AB three ninety to the California act to save lives. We needed that. Additionally I have served- roles here on campus as our black city you use community program director and also spearheaded the creation. Of a statewide campaign. Named racial justice now which is housing operated under the university of California student association. I've actually spoken on the select committee before as a witness to other structural issues that California California tie ducation system has and I'm grateful to be here today. I believe it is incredibly symbolic to have this hearing here given that given what we know about the black experience a cow. I can appreciate the messes this hearing will have not only. To the administration at this campus but also to the rest of the UC administration including our outgoing and incoming you see president's. Students have known for a while now is that despite the common descriptor of a progressive campus in the most progressive city in the world. Students of color tend to suffer a UC Berkeley. The twenty fourteen campus climate report for which we are all reflecting on here today highlighted that students of color and black students especially. Felt alienated in uncomfortable on all of our UC campuses. What's more is that many black staff members in faculty felt the same way. That's understandable considering that many of our black staff members are unionized and often told their labor isn't as valuable as it should be by are you see ministration. But it is surely. That report sparked H. were sparked by a trail of over instances of discrimination on our campuses. Revealed that our campuses have a problem. In that problem has arguably gotten worse. I say that because there are at less under represented minorities and black students on our campus is here now then in twenty fourteen. And the students have not felt their sentiments being translated and reverberated by the administration. That's not to say that our our administration has made no effort UC Berkeley has rolled out the African American initiative features cautious were small courts of about two dozen students. Administration me regularly with the black student union and other affinity groups on campus strides have been made and I think our vice chancellor an assistant vice chancellor Oscar to money muted well. For helping our student leaders. But these efforts are not felt by large swaths of our communities because unfortunately. The conditions they are experiencing at Berkeley have not changed. Black students are still facing instances of discrimination on our campuses they are still facing police discrimination and brutality despite you see B. D. receiving more training than any other department in the country. At least that's what they say. And soon still feel like they don't belong. I'll give us all an example. Following the passage of proposition two oh nine which banned affirmative action across the state the UC implemented what are called student academic preparation in educational partnerships or say pet programs to address the real income education and racial gaps that have played our education institutions. These programs have been heralded by the state legislature as the primary means of promoting diversity at the UC but year after year since two thousand five they receive pay cut after pay cut and there funding in real dollars has decreased coupled with rising housing costs. And skyrocketing tuition. Black students and students of color because of the systemic marginalization that are cancer mentioned earlier in our society are too often also our lowest income students and are hit hardest by the lack of resources. We definitely feel like we don't belong if we can't afford to go here. Almost starve ourselves in order to afford our books. Another example that's a little more intimate. You see PT please use the PT that's had a terrible police officer on its payroll for decades name officer Shauna Ramos bass number seventy six. People Noah. This officer has terrorize members of our community both on and off campus his claim to fame being when he arrested and confiscated the wallets of a Latino hot dog vendor at a cal football game. One black student in particular has been literally harass by this officer over six times for fraud in the soon to not be a student. He was so bad that he became a symbol for us of just how by bad cops can be and how much they can get away with. And finally after years of complaints. Petitions meetings and investigations. UC Berkeley led arenas retire. Retired he wasn't fired he wasn't brought to justice he was let he left with the retirement plan and could serve at any other police department if you wanted to. At offices symbolize how much we really meant to this university. Fortunately my colleague marine will delve more into our police relations but adding that to a lack of resources black face a UCLA in twenty thirteen deport them all signs at UC San Diego and you see more said in twenty seventeen and a disaster over free speech week last year. Black students especially have been reminded that we are not welcome. And that's probably part of the story that U. S. C. report black students face a graduation gap of 16% compared to the campus as a whole black shoes complete Berkeley at a rate that's 15% lower than the rest of the campus and this by making up over 6% of the California population. Black students are only one point 9% of this campus. We are underserved in under taught not just at Berkeley by the way that all of our UC campuses. That USC report validated will black students have been feeling for decades. Like to have a special then on our campus called black Wednesday. Every Wednesday all of the all the black students gather for the Golden Bear cafe to exist with one another to meet each other. And just enjoy each other's company. It's a space re created for ourselves when we didn't have one a place to listen to music and see each other on campus. Because it's been so where to see ourselves anywhere else in our classrooms in our discussions when our dorm rooms. For decades student leaders that organizes of and have had a harder and harder time to yield a sizeable crowd AB like Wednesday. We felt our numbers dwindle every year soon as dropped out after two years our brothers and sisters are falling in between the car the cracks. Crushed by the lack of support the receiving by this campus. For so long are concerned- receipt then brush away. With administrative as ministration anticipating. That the graduation of student leaders can induce and then some spell of a short term memory loss. Recycling four year old ideas and conversations and sending it back years of progress. So for all of us in the room a reminder. Proposition two one nine devastated the numbers of black Latin American native American Pacific Islander in middle eastern students on our campuses. We have asked for our campus in the UC administration directly to take a stand of opposition to proposition two or nine. And work with you number of are the members of our state legislature to recall the proposition. We ask you know. Choose a color and black students to work with the students of color black in black students to overturn proposition two or nine so that our students can receive the resources they need. To be taught equitably. An additional asked we have is to better support are safe at programs. Free ongoing funding that restores and maintains state support tied to inflation undergrads an undergraduate population growth. You see students and staff alike have been squeezed of resources for over a decade and I diversity has suffered as a result. Culture senator recruitment centers are utilizing student labor like their full time employees and they're not getting paid for it. In order to make up the loss of the state induce. Are soon as well on campus and those who may one day envision themselves here need to feel like they can belong here. These are a few ways we can start and I welcome my colleagues to share their testimony as and also offer their recommendations for you all thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Maureen Simmons. Thank you first I want to say thank you so much to you assembly member Dr Shirley Weber for. Grazing in our campus today. And it means so very much to not only UC Berkeley but- I am certain that time your presence and recommendations I'm will be felt throughout this see issues- cece's. And the UC system. My name is Maureen Simmons and- this is my last semester at UC Berkeley. It's so important for me today to- to have this meeting. As my colleague Dominic Williams pointed out it was roughly about a year ago that I sat in a room. And with members of our black student leaders and we discussed that U. S. the article. I was my first semester here on the campus of UC Berkeley and as a first generation older student. I was heartbroken. At just the fact that students felt someone welcomed- at first and want to believe it and then. Very quickly I soon began to realize that this was a space that was quite hostile to people that look like me. I am the timing of relevance of this is so very important and I don't want that to be to go unnoticed. The procedure I am so to the roles that I have on the campus one of them is the internal terror police oversight and I want to talk about specific examples of the relationships between black students on this campus and you see P. D. N. how all that interplay's with the racial tensions on the campus my role as the internal chair of police oversight is to provide recommendations to the community leaders as well as to- are relevant stakeholders which would include our chancellor's office. I have had the opportunity to meet with our cancer- on an occasion last semester and I want to talk about to loop of the incidents that led to the conversations all of two thousand eighteen as I said I'm members of the S. you see- spearheaded by myself and members of other black student organizations how to conversation with the chancellor's office following an incident where it was determined that you see PD use excessive force in response to a campus incident for faculty members were staging a peaceful protest- when video surfaced of the police and county Mister David Cole could be seen surrounded. Their protesters as UC PD. Made contact with the men of simply arrested him. Another incident is earlier this year my office was involved in an incident what was brought to my attention that one of our African American female students. Who is currently enrolled suffered an encounter with UC PD that resulted in her arrest. That student suffered severe trauma and mental anguish and is still traumatized to this day. I placed several phone calls to UC PD as is required by my office. I was able to set up a meeting with our chief of police Margot Bennett and also lieutenant Julie Williams who has worked and closely with my office and the a as you see on similar incidents. You're not meeting I was really. Taken aback by one of the comments that. Chief Bennett said in an in essence not a direct quote but she talked about her lack of understanding of where this rage racial animosity comes from in the fact that as a white. Female that she just really simply does not understand and cannot really empathize with black people but that she hopes to get there one day. To lead our police department and not understand what the- implications of that sort of mindset is was completely as far as I was concerned unacceptable. I am following that meeting and conversation- I'm- lieutenant Williams said in the conversation something else that was really startling and it speaks to the racial tensions on this campus. He talked about the fact that the student who was only guilty of having a taser and when she tried to give the taser over to the police officer. There was a struggle that ensued just because they said she reached for the taser. And they tackled her arrested her and the response that I ask was there any other way to handle that what I was told by lieutenant Williams is. In essence she's lucky that we didn't shoot her and if we would have shot her it would have been. Killed. The fact that are UC PD- for some of you it's the first time you're hearing that but- for the fact that are you see PD was here and supposed to be a part of our campus community and team. To ensure that students not only feel safe here but welcome here what have the attitude that they would think that it's okay to say that we would shoot a student. Over a taser is startling when I met with chancellor Chris I am price I asked that was there any way that we can begin to manage our relationships between that the UC PD and students. I talked about the fact that white students. I am large don't have the same types of incidences. Of the things that I asked for I'm that we thought was very reasonable was the fact that we wanted police vehicles Berkeley is a very heavily militarized. On campus when you come on to our campus the first thing that you see if you enter from the MLK side our police vehicles. Right behind an adjacent to those police vehicles is our Fannie Lou Hamer center with our black student resource center I asked can we move the police vehicles because it's traumatizing that black students bill that they're in circled in in case. By police and I was told that we could do that. To date that has not happened another thing that we ask during that meeting this if we could have more sensitivity training for police officers so that when they engage with black students in particular. Given the climate that we have in this country it's not just on this campus on this country that we need to begin to be able to deal better we were told that we would get that. To date we have not done that finally we asked if we could have the police not look like numbers of swat because this is a college. As they should be part of the allege culture we're talking about a reasonable. Request to date they still look like swapped. Black students have continued to raise and finally in my last few comments I want to piggy back on what my colleague Dominic Williams said. In regards to proposition two oh nine. Just a few months ago when the members of the UC yes they met and we begin to talk about the strategic efforts that we could take to begin to deal with the issues that students face in the UC system. I thought. We have to repeal two oh nine to get anything done. That is an effort that we are leading as students we are asking the- administration to join in that effort to repeal proposition two oh nine. And as student we believe that that will create a more harmonious impressed I'm- more harmonious culture for us. And on UC system CSU systems as well as the season with that I think you. Thank you our our final speaker for the day. Good evening this thing. Good evening give it good evening distinguished members of the state assembly cancer crest administrators members of the community I would like to for start up a recognizing this land and its indigenous people members of the who Chen alone the tribe we must recognize this sad sad history of this land and the genocide that occurred. For the university to be built. Secondly I want to thank doctor Weber in her office for the time they have spent. In the development of this event their commitment to stern activism and up lifting the margin and up lifting the voices of marginalized communities. Lastly I would like to recognize. The students of this community who have contributed to development of this event. And those who allow their passions to drive their commitment into carrying out the work. Thank you to marine. Dominic on the Tara Varsha. Lucky a million and local. As we speak about the injustices and hardships faced by students of color and the institution of higher education. I want to encourage folks to be cognizant of the reasons for why we are here more specifically I want people to reflect on why it has been five years. Since students have see very to little no change and how they are being met. I acknowledge that the few changes that have taken place in the past five years. Certainly I Berkeley have been born out of black student activism. Not university officials are region's. For example the Fannie Lou hammer black resource center the African American initiative and the two but mental health therapist we have today our our fruits of the labor of blacks in activism in twenty fifteen. And on were today. As a sophomore stern here cap. My experiences have been nothing short of Dominic statement I still to this day remember in ways I was welcome. To this campus as a black Muslim identifying male. I remember being met was there's a confusion irrational fear an outcast ostracized by peers and their families alike. As I moved into the residence hall on day one. It is and has been a commonality among our blocks the population for blacks it is to not feel as welcomed on this campus as our non black peers slash counterparts. It is too often wear black students are faced with the cost of policing by. Of their rights and a and access to this camp is and it is known practice for you see PD to ideas and be and us to feel isolated by you see employees. I will never forget the moment during my first semester. Mid term season I was leaving Moffit library around two AM. And stop I used to be the officer asked a series of questions about my whereabouts with the assumption that I was not a student here. After coming to the conclusion that I am indeed a student here cal. He let me go and I returned home safe. When we talk about safety who can afford. For students such as myself who carry them narrative a multiple marginalize identities and is predominant white and east Asian American space we know these encounters are very much a part of our everyday lives both on and off campus. So the question becomes what is safety and what is that look like for black people. When the curry CPD chief of the UC Santa Cruz is a state police officer who pepper sprayed innocent students during a demonstration at UC Davis. And when you see PT officers at UC Santa Barbara filed a lawsuit against the CPD for discrimination and harassment the workplace simply for trying to be better cops. We know that you see P. D. as an institution is problematic. In fact a diversity projects spearheaded by the chances office. Found that students of color one UC Berkeley's administration to and I quote. Consider entry experiences of policing as a key dimension. Of campus belonging and address the needs and concerns reported by students. Who have experience negative encounters with the police directly and you're care sleep. Especially black students LGBT because LGBT Q. aye plus students. Nontraditional students. And students from underrepresented minority groups. I asked over twenty black students to describe their feelings about cal with one word. Dangerous dramatic safe hopeless on heard depressive anxious terrorizing marginalizing useless heartbreaking oppressive community questionable tiring over burdening and uncomfortable. These are just some of their responses for the built in the room I would like you all to be aware of them and for the students in the room look no further than the person sitting next to you because many the participants are sitting right here with us. Today. These feelings translate the poor and the performance levels. Putting back in Boston is at a disadvantage in comparison to their non. Like invested appears. Not to mention the fact that many of these students double jobs families and activities beyond the classroom. We know when students feel safe and welcomed they perform better and in return promote a healthier campus climate. However when students come to the campus with their outside experiences of having to live in a world of racism. Misogyny Islamophobia xterra coupled with their experiences within student body here I cal hopelessness becomes the reality. This is in addition to the fact that black and white next the this is in addition to the lack of black in the annex staff faculty and administrators. Take a look at our campus in your cabin and what you'll find is a predominant white ministration that is tasked. With inclusivity of all people on campus. I noticed of conversation to have but as university as human beings we must be aware. Of how this campus and many others within the state of California. Disproportionately affect. And continue to marginalize students of color. Our tax dollars go to the same institutions that her and traumatize our youth. And it's only right that we ask the necessary questions to hold administration accountable. So what does that look like legislatively I propose that the state legislators allocate more funny to the you see that goes to support one is programs and resources for black about communities on our campus. This a good staff and faculty and should expense each campus throughout the state of California. This here I Berkeley are are black committee has a- African Americans to develop office. And the Fannie Lou black cam resource center which I'll mention again with the center that was fought for not given by the Universitarios I suggest that the state legislators focus on intensely supporting marginalized groups within our campus community. And think of ways on how they can for the support the state ability of them. I'd advise the campus administration actively listen to the grievances of students of color. And one express their needs. And actually work with them to solve these problems with agency. Berkeley needs to and should recognize that there is a crisis within the ways in which black students engage with this campus. As stated in the US the report. While the study did not cover approve any new information what it did do. Was validate the sentiments from the community and raise awareness and conversation around the bodies. Of black students in higher education and within the context of this campus. If people are serious about tackling the campus climate issues. See the UC Berkeley undergraduates the diversity project campus experience working group's recommendations that I cited earlier. I want to thank members of the community for the resilience I am and dedication to persevere despite the legacies of prop two nine and racism as these institutions were not originally built for us I continue to thrive off that notion. You see Burke as institution oppose systematic oppression it continues to March I students of color. Thank you to the members of the assembly for coming out and administration administration personal here with us today. Thank you to me as the rest of the world was assisted by center for equity inclusion and the chief of staff to authored by who is the vice has of equity inclusion for being administrators who we can trust and work closely with black about students. They get a ticket Jackson who is director of aftermarket to develop office who has countless number of times been there for us and care through the better students and finally I want to thank you to my ancestors welcome before me I sacrifice. Their lives for me to be here today doing this work. Thank you. Want to thank all of our student panelists. Even as much to chew on it that think about. If I had to ask each one of you to give me just one suggestion that you think would truly make a difference on this campus and all campuses. Just one. What would it be and I'll start at the far end- for that one that you think would really make a difference. I don't know there's a lot but if you have a no one is to say aha yes. Definitely decreasing policing on college campuses the what decreasing policing on college campuses what is that me so- recently and my campus particularly we've increased- policing so having more police officers on campus which I personally do not feel safe knowing that they're on every corner- patrolling and- keeping us safe for emergencies in reality- they don't do that. The just. Create more fear within- a lot of black and brown students- especially around the college of ethnic studies which mostly a lot of our black and brown students are located- there mostly patrolling that area more aggressively. So okay would would would would down. What would and because often times the only can one way and all of us have that. What would- what would create. A safer or feeling of a safer environment that a police officer. Because normally in our culture that talks about safety so what would what would it look like- would be hiring a more counselors a social workers would be- you know I I'm not sure. That's why I'm asking you what would it look like if we were to talk about. Of decreasing the number of police officers on campus. In order to make you feel safe what would we increase. Definitely more counselors I know at my school in particular there's one counselor for every thirteen thousand students- which is a lack of counseling for a lot of our black and brown full. On our campus so definitely increasing more counselors. Alright what would you have as as the number one thing keeping because I was amazed at some of the things you step faculty were doing which I consider to be- as a former faculty are still faculty merit is on campus I would consider to be just one of the worst things that could ever happen would be for a faculty it'd give misinformation but also to create an environment where other students who feel. That they have the right to have a negative attitude toward someone as I me. We have a greater responsibility than that so as a faculty member I find it very difficult what do you think would be the one thing that that could happen that could. On this campus as well as a community college what December Dino at the community college. What would you think would be important to as one thing that would that you think would really make a difference for is for Islamic students- so. I think honestly when you look at the data from UC Berkeley specifically. Most of the vast majority over 85% of our faculty and staff are white. So that just having that you know that they are going to be partnering with organizations that are harmful. To you know whether it's black students whether it's most some students whether it's not next units- do used. It if we don't have diverse faculty and staff they will never understand the issues that we are talking about they will never understand. The daily you know issues that we deal with those students the fact that the UC system has made no effort in trying to. Hire more staff that is more diverse and more actually knowledgeable on these issues the fact that. I was so excited to take. Okay as a language class because my family is from focus on and would do is our- national language. I was excited to take that course until I realized the professors the white male from Texas. Okay soul and this is no disrespect to you know however much you might have study that language or anything like that but when he's referencing Bollywood in India. To try to teach the national language of August on is very. Just I don't I don't I mean yeah it's very uncomfortable and the fact that you know. The fact that we don't have diverse faculty the fact that our faculty are working with programs like C. V. E. the fact that we have to ask are you know so. School in administration not to partner with organizations that help ice or other organizations our students are continuing to be targeted not just within the classroom but you've been outside the classroom when these professors. Are working with organizations that don't see us as human. Thank you Dominic would you would be the one thing that I'm gonna ask us all to be brief because I know we've got another panel to hear- what would be the one thing you think what. Would help. Refill pop tune. Sounds good okay what about you Marin. Well I want to take the other side of woods idea was saying that we need to make a greater effort to recruit and retain blacks across the issues the seasons and the UC system and the reason for that is because if we don't have students today we won't have a diverse faculty for tomorrow we're trying to pull faculty out of a- that is limited to begin with and so we've got a began to make our pool- better and that will take a- systemic changes. Over a long period of time I need to be a trend actively engage in aye second- what my colleague says is without repeal two oh nine we already know we're gonna keep hearing that we are limited we can't do it so hill told nine but we need to have more- you know a real effort I have twenty years in human resources I don't know how it is that we keep saying to all nine is the issue. I hired black full all the time and it wasn't discriminatory but- here we are. Among. Two things arm our campus loves money and they left making promises so I would ask that the state legislator in conjunction with lieutenant governor. To work with the UC regents body to have a plan. That actually- has some and goals with the time frame. That when our campus makes promises that they keep them and ask these- problems they're being audited. And our campuses are actively being- investigated ease maybe two years three years four years. To make sure that they're making a promises because right now- the only organizations on our campus they're doing good work like bridges. Which recoup some attended by students and other under percent minority groups our house in a closet- you know for the former student union. And they were supposed to have an actual center- into in nineteen were here right now we don't have that. So it be nice for the state government's their auditing and start wondering where's the money going to. Sounds good sounds great. Want to thank all of you- just so you know that- two oh nine is not that far from our conversation in the capital. At least my conversation so- we will be making decisions about that. Fairly soon. But thank you very much for your your your. Thank you we're going to have our- are put second panel which is you see. See issue and community colleges. The talk about the progress an update of on- dial on recommendations from the twenty fourteen campus climate recommendations and responses to the rise. In racial hate incidents- it's quite a challenge on these campuses we know to try to meet those needs and to bring the change that so central. To all of our campuses- in some of made more progress than others and some. Makes progress forward and then someone of the gets pulled back- it's not easy to- try to bring change on campus that they most of you realize that. So we have with us today we have- the second panel. In the panel provides us with an update on the progress as I say that they've made. On the twenty fourteen campus climate recommendations. Of representing the university of California we have Lee is how a monk. Who is the associate vice provost for the UC office of the president. And Oscar do bond junior who's vice chance of equity inclusion of year UC Berkeley.

Reginald Blaylock who's in from presidential associate for student affairs partnerships in senior strategist. I'm cal poly Pomona- lastly we have representing the communicative we have doctor Cynthia all of all who is seek you out from the California community colleges chancellors. Chief student services officers and vice president of student services at Pasadena City College. So it's great to have you all here- and we look. Forward to hearing you beginning with a- our first person on the panel Liz lemon. Thank you doctor Weber good evening. My name is Liz hollow mall and I'm the associate vice provost for diversity engagement. The universe the California office of the president. On behalf of the UC president I want to thank you for your continued interest doctor Weber in advocacy. Improving the campus climate for all of our students faculty and staff. I also want to thank the students speakers for sharing their perspectives. You will experience as a recommendations. We can all action that acts of heat intolerance discrimination or bias whether directed at individual or group have long term effects on the believe our students to learn and thrive. For faculty teach effectively conduct world class research and of our staff to work and contribute productively. It is our responsibility both at the system level one of the campuses to do whatever we can to improve our campus climate. As president Nepal tunnel said in two thousand fourteen. Respect and inclusion requires a constant attention Militar used to community every student every professor every administrator every staff member everybody every day. UC campuses develop action plans in response to our two thousand thirteen system wide campus climate survey. But those action plans could not anticipate the signet Vance but a fundamentally shifted the nature of discourse in colleges and universities across the nation. These events of course include the two thousand sixteen presidential election the rise of the all right. For your actions to rescind doc grow in anti immigrant policies outside groups expressing their view points directly on UC campuses. So if asked whether it's been harder for universities to quote unquote manage campus climate I would say absolutely yes. With that in mind I will now summarize so the most recent system wide efforts to prove campus climate. Those efforts are intended to complement and support efforts of the campus level some of which will be described by my colleague UC Berkeley vice chancellor Oscar newborn. First starting in spring two thousand seventeen UC campuses were the scene of a number of bands. Incidences or demonstrations their chartered Ted marginalized groups or individuals. Resulted in campus unrest and negatively affecting campus climate as you will recall the events in UC's responses to them. Destructive local and national media attention. To guide officials from the campus is a managing the best of this kind we develop tools and training that help caps in ministry- is police chiefs diversity officers campus council lawyers indeed of students. To coordinate and maintain consistency with respect to the university's position on free speech. Time place and manner roles protest management protocols responses. To acts of hate or tolerance this includes. To prepare for in marriage major incidences like the kind I described. Since this time of the campuses are far better equipped and prepared to both respond to these kinds of events while also taking ongoing proactive steps to maintain a positive campus climate. A second example is the UC policing task force. Two thousand eighteen present president appall tunnel. Created a prison presidential task force to examine the investigative practices. In the use of force related policies and training of the UC police departments. This was in an effort to strengthen the departments practices. And their relationships and interactions with the community. Some key task force recommendations included. The creation of a uniform complaint process at all you see two locations including an intake system for reporting complaints. Officer misconduct and the post is incidents review process. The continued development of policy and training on the use of force including de escalation techniques and effective communication. And as we will hear more from from the vice chancellor it upon the creation of advisory boards on every campus include faculty staff and student representatives. As of this date the advisory boards have been formed at all the campuses the complaint intake system is the early stages of I. T. development. A third example is in the area of anti virus training. As you know doctor Weber the two thousand eighteen budget act included a one time appropriation of one point two million dollars. For two year pilot program to provide antibodies training for ministers faculty staff and student leaders at you see an ad CSU. Joint UC workgroup issued a request for proposals. Select your just communities of central coast to deliver the pilot program. These training will reach sixteen hundred UC and CSU faculty student leaders senior administrators in start trainers I fourteen okay a four locations across the state. Training will begin in January twenty twenty and will conclude with train the trainer workshops July twenty twenty. Through these trainings participants will examine they're all personal by cities and then they will also learn how they can influence behavior decision making in academia. The walls in about in practice the Marvel used to practical strategies to this rock bias. Thank you again doctor Weber for you continue commitment and advocacy on these issues. Are you see we are trying to pry the tools the methods the people to respond to acts of intolerance by hate. At the same time. Keeping constant attention every day by everybody consisting respectful campus climate. For all of our students back being staff. I will do my best to answer any questions you might have thank you. This a double. Thank you doctor ever for inviting me to speak on this important panel on behalf of UC Berkeley for thought like to say like to thank the students for once again affirming how they are always on the right two sides of the issues so I really appreciate that- also like to thank Ahmed for- acknowledging the land were in- that's something that we should always. Be in our conscience around not just being gassed in the land of the- wake me Aloni but also- to understand that the work that we do should always be in honor of the histories of. The or people who are here. The issue of campus climate as it relates to campus safety protocols and procedures the prevailing and persistent topic on the nursing the California campus. At Berkeley. A clear indication that we are not where we need to be on this deeply important issue. In order to get there we must first articulate what that there is. That there is to be a place where institutional excellence is founded on principles of belonging where the full humanity of each and every member of our campus community is recognized and respected. And invited to print transform the academic enterprise the research the student experience university structures. Practices and more in a process of co creation. But before we can get there we must acknowledge the tent challenges and histories that have pave the road to the president. One of enormous achievements as well as one of systemic marginalization. Like most institutions. And structures in this nation UC Berkeley have was established as the White serving institution or is it because existence. And over its existing has promoted whiteness at the cultural norms and standards in which its institutional excellence is couch. These historical and experience of facts are antithetical to our principles of community and are valuing of diversity. We must be intentional and making institutional and cultural shift that support belonging beyond the norm in support of non white groups specifically and marginalized targeted communities in general. My remarks will therefore examine the campus climate and campus experience data of under represented a marginalized groups through this lance. As my colleague Liz Holly misstated the entire UC system took a UC campus climate survey awhile back. At UC Berkeley in nineteen in two thousand thirteen our data indicated the following. 25% of respondents reported that they personally experience exclusionary behavior ranging from intimidation isolation and exclusion to hostility. A higher percentage of ethnic and racial under presented groups especially African Americans reported experiencing exclusionary behavior based on the racial identity as compared to non under represented minorities. A higher percentage AB T. Q. plus and persons with disabilities reported experiencing exclusionary behavior at their to other groups. A higher percentage of staff respondents reported experiencing exclusionary behavior based on their position status as compared to faculty. UC Berkeley took immediate action to think through the best ways to address our specific campus climate issues here represent some north now know where the actions. The African American initiative lunch in two thousand and fifteen with six major objectives. To raise twenty million dollars in scholarship fund for African American students. To improve the recruitment and yield of African American students and other under represented at that minorities. To boost the social personal and academic support provided to current and future African American students. To improve the classroom campus experiences to increase African American staff representation in Berkeley senior management and to improve the campus experience frac for after the making staff and faculty. In part in partnership with black students you see Burke. Any Lou Hamer black resource center in two thousand seventeen which centers on the needs of black students and is open to everyone. This resource center acts as a hub for ballistic services to black students ranging from academic social and psychological belonging. In two thousand seventeen the disability strategy team analyze concerns brought to our leadership by our campus community with disabilities I submitted a report Jennifer crisis with five recommendations. The goals of the stables dreaded abilities tragedy team where to move beyond compliance and close persisting caps that keep members of the disabled community from experiencing the campus equitably. As a result in two thousand eighteen we hired a five oh four eighty a compliance officer and created an offices of this work we need. Further in our next. To establish at the table community cultural center. UC Berkeley for gender equity resource that in collaboration with campus and non campus partners continues to be a home for the aged LGBT Q. plus community and support other wellness and to provide tools to educate the campus community for example a set of videos was produced to broaden our understanding about the importance of using preferred gender pronouns. Dead to acknowledge the full humanity of a LGBT Q. plus and marginalized communities. Effectively serve California in the nation we are working on a path to becoming an Hispanic serving institution. This year the chancellor appointed a task force to develop a blueprint that will not only clarify and effective plan for our region recruitment. Of underrepresented minority students including the land it's community within the prop two oh nine framework but also to. Transform the campus experience through a framework of belonging we're by white superiority is no longer the- norm and the experience and contributions of our- color to margin immunities are elevated. Chancellor Chris the nav and initiative in which faculty cluster hiring will be pursued around five areas a scholarship that will support the campus. The campus is commitment to faculty diversity. Through a campus wide all proposals for the cluster hiring a faculty across the stem fields social sciences and arts and me and he's- has been submitted. This in its initiative is in addition to very successful effort funded through the state supported initiative on faculty diversity. In two thousand seventeen. And the chancellor engage the entire campus community to examine policy the procedures that both protect free speech and maintain our principles of community. Throughout the many activities panels talks and forums that were held hate speech at psychological state the rose to the top of the conversation for marginalized communities. The university provides information on the stop hate website on how to this report I hate and buys incident as well as how to obtain support and- support services. Hate instances eighty incidences are described in the following categories intimidation bullying physical violence hate speech graffiti but realism Hossa clam make climate. Bias incident and expression of bias. Our current ethics point data show that we had thirty eight reported on campus on campus hate incidences. To reported hate crimes one camp security and one report of harassment during the two thousand seventeen reporting year. And into the in. Eighteen thirty reported on K. incidences to hate. Also. Appropriate support services such as counseling psychological services and the- for support an intervention in addition to other identity based resource centers that may be helpful on the prevention side we have the bears that care program which is located within the center for. A for support and intervention. This year the UC UC Berkeley large its local my experience survey examining the campus climate- through it the experiences of the campus community we are currently in the process of analyzing these look these local data. To come up with a set of interventions to a best any gaps in experience for the campus community here are some preliminary findings regarding. Regarding campus expertise concerning police- policing on campus. Approximately three quarters of respondents rated you see put you see PT positively. Minority Maynard ties groups consistently rated you see PD lower than majority types peers. Between half and two thirds of African American and trans gender non conforming a gender non conforming respondents rated you see P. D. negative. These results a line with broader national finding of perception of police. Initiated by student activism following incidents of police violence naturally and on and on or near UC campuses and consistent with these preliminary results. The UC why presidential task force on university wide policing with convene Erica mena that each campus that was an independent advisory board to work with his leadership the campus community and its police department in identifying and addressing issues Bob mean the safety and quietly quality of life- of students staff and faculty. I personally think that this is the number one issue on campus around campus climate. When asistir someone up quickly okay on okay- UC Berkeley established the it's in the pen and write report. On police accountability and community safety which held its first meeting in mid September I'm happy to discuss that more further. Does that we share and appreciate your interest and care for this particular topic on behalf of students faculty and staff we understand that. The type of change that we are discussing takes time resources and shared accountability among campus administrators campus community and the general public thank you. Our will and it would miss Friedman. Yes thank you doctor web review. Attention it is all of the I see the. My name your Friedman and I service the associate vice chancellor and deputy general counsel for the California State University. Thank you so much for inviting me to speak today before your select committee campus climate and I'd also really like to thank the students who spoke so eloquently- earlier- I'm going to update you on the steps of the CSU. Campuses have taken and continue to take to improve campus I met since the committee's hearings in two thousand fourteen and its subsequent report I feel like I have a lot of good news to report but when I think about what the student said I realize that we really still have a lot more work to do. A my chance office colleagues in academic and student affairs and equity and Percy regret their unable to be here today- they're conducting a three days system wide training for campus administrators on California state. Percy processes for responding to and investigating discrimination and harassment complaint so I guess that's a good reason that they're not here. My testimony today will include nation that my colleagues have provided to me. And I hope that I'll be able to answer any follow up questions but if not we'd be happy to provide further information writing at your request. CS use for an eighty thousand students make up the most ethnically economically and academically diverse student body in the nation. The CSU provides more than half of all undergraduate degrees earned by California's Latino African American and native American students. Nearly one third of CSU students are the first in their family to attend college. Because of this the CSU is committed and determined to create a welcoming environment for all members of the campus community. We have increased our efforts on student touch points through a student centers and other affinity groups to improve a sense of belonging for students of all backgrounds. Student affairs staff student life and development staff academic counselors including staff from E. O. P. foster youth programs and dream centers are in constant dialogue with our students so that our students experiences can inform our programming and trainings and so that we can continue to improve our campus climate for all. Our programming is varied in substance and modality includes diversity awareness and campus orientation sessions multi cultural welcome receptions for newly enrolled students and work with their student leadership. On approaches that they believe would best serve their fellow students. Campus forums to discuss campus climate online training for faculty and students and also campus climate surveys which more than half of our can campus does have conducted in the last five years. The goal of orientation is to help new students become familiar with their campus this is their new home. To have them interact with and meet new people and to build a network of friends and support to learn about resources and to gain knowledge of university policies and procedures. Many of our campuses are experimenting with approaches that involve peer to peer discussions for example at San Jose state the chief diversity officer combines presentations with small group discussions led by students. And finds that this approach allows for more intimate and substantive discussion of complex issues surrounding diversity and identities of race ethnicity class religion sexual orientation gender identity and immigration status. Each CSU campus has at least one cultural program club organization or center on its campus many have more. Depending on such as each campus has key staff overseeing its efforts to ensure a safe welcoming and inclusive environment for all students. Eighteen of our twenty three campuses have opened dream centers that provide a touch point and support to undocumented students and allies. Even campuses that do not have an actual center provide support and have at least one point of contact for students. The CSU will use some of the one time basic needs funding in this year's budget to create partnerships with community and other external organizations so is to increase and leverage whenever possible wraparound services available to our students here are some examples of our work. We're developing ongoing partnerships with community organizations that have a tradition of helping populations experiencing basic needs and security. We are connecting students with community case managers who have knowledge and expertise in accessing safety net resources at our counseling centers we offer personal counselling sessions to address family and relationships sexual identity suicide and other psychological needs and our counseling centers also offer support groups focus on gender cultural groups and sexuality. The service delivery model is extremely important to empowering students to take advantage of mental health services. The committee's report noted the importance of dis aggregating certain data emphasizing that providing disaggregated data for the fifty ethnic or national origins that have in the past been categories as one group. Asian Pacific islanders will help to demonstrate the disparities that exist between them. I am pleased to report that since two thousand eighteen we reported on such dis aggregated data on our system wide website. We're also collecting data with respect to LGBT Q. plus community- for example the cal state apply application and the student self service portal. Invite applicants and students to provide information about their sexual identity and sexual or Asian. The chancellor's office is also developing modifications to our common common management system to help campuses implement the use of preferred pronouns. As the state of California and the CSU have rebounded from the recession we've also improved our- the hiring of tenure track faculty and it's the data shows that it is more diverse but there's still more work to be done. I'm not gonna talk about the anti bias trainings because Liz has already described those- and just in closing I want to say that university campuses our marketplace of ideas and it's important that our community sustain a healthy appetite for debate. And even for disagreement. The CSU does not and cannot restrict who was invited to speak on our campuses based on the content of their speech. Provided that the speech is lawful and I have to tell you that hate speech is lawful. Not something we welcome but it's not prohibited by law. Controversial speakers present many challenges that drain economic and human resources on our campuses this is important work and we must safeguard the safety and rights of our entire community to be heard and to dissent even when speech causes pain and anger. We also work hard to teach our students and other of our community that the best way to respond to speech with which we disagree. Is with more speech. We owe it to our students to lead by example and help them learn how to speak and dissent effectively. The university's response to incidents of hate. What happened. And whether the incident involved more than protected speech the rules can seem very technical at sometimes infuriating that individuals are not held accountable for expressing before views that because a lot of pain to members of our community. We might not be able to undertake formal discipline but that does not stop us from appropriately responding to incidents to ensure and maintain a safe environment that demands compassion and respect. Campus professionals including bias response team serve a very important role in safeguarding our community values provided they do not create confusion about where to report and how to seek supportive measures. Universities are microcosm of the complex world in which we live and we're deeply committed to make imposes an inclusive welcoming learning environment that's a safe home for all of our students we thank you for your support during these challenging times. Thank you. Thank system is to play a lot. A good evening ladies and gentlemen. It is an honor to be with you this evening. It is. A deep personal privilege to be here tonight. My freshman and sophomore years in college back to Weber was a faculty member mine a professor of mine. This is just three or four years ago okay no are you. She she was then. Teaching and training nurturing developing growing. And yes loving her students then as she's doing the same is for students and faculty and staff and families and communities now. So for me to be here this evening it's really quite amazing and personal privilege of mine to be here enjoying doctor Weber. I also want to take a moment to honor- our students from the C. issue a launcher Garcia. To come here to see that you drove two hours to get here and traffic is gonna drive I was a good home tonight. To come here represent four hundred and eighty thousand students in the largest university system in America. We appreciate. Want to work thank you for over recognized her in honoring her this evening. One take this time to share with you a little information about Cal Poly Pomona homeowner Broncos. And our campuses commitment to diversity. A couple more sets on the eastern edge of Los Angeles county and what is the neighboring county of San Bernadino. The campus is a little more than twenty six thousand students. It's an eighty year old institution. And it is supported by about twenty five hundred faculty and staff. And the student body is roughly one third Latino one quarter Gen and 3% black. The campus has been designated is already been designated as a Hispanic serving institution. And is in the top twenty five colleges awarding baccalaureate degrees to Hispanics. Recently the Hispanic business magazine also a lot of the university's ability to help Hispanic graduates. Couple of homeowners commitment to fostering inclusion at our institution start from the lead ship would dock disarray coldly. As the six president of our campus present cold is the first woman to be named Presidente cal poly Pomona. She is ushered in a new era of strategic leadership for the campus establishing a vision for cal poly Pomona as a model for an inclusive party technic university that inspires creativity. Discover en innovation embraces local and global challenges and transforms lives in fact in of the third one thousand three hundred and sixty three universities listed. On the most recent social mobility index cal poly Pomona's third in the nation. That means moving students from poverty to middle class within five years after graduation. Kampala promote is the most diverse polytechnic university in America. And we are committed to valuing and the lived experiences of our multi ethnic student body. This begins immediately for students even before they formally start their academic journey account Polly. All incoming students. Including first time freshman transfer participate in a mandatory orientation that prioritizes diversity training. Such training into discussions about their diverse identities and how these may shake their experiences at the institution. Wants to join our campus the university fosters connections to our six cultural centers the play a critical role in empowering them towards success through engagement. Leadership development and diversity in Richmond. The cultural centers include the African Americans to resource center the Asian Pacific Islander center this season each Chavez center for higher education. The native American student center the pride center and the women's resource center. Additionally in two thousand sixteen we launched the Broncos dreamers resource center. All new frankly are required to also participate in orientation training program which includes diversity and inclusion training as essential components of introduction to our campus community. This fall Kampala homeowner is also hosting to campus conversations for its students discussing our collective efforts to foster inclusion in our university that is meant to engage our student body. The first in conversation was held on October twenty third at students and of course and November twenty first will be hosting our next- student campus conversations. The intent is to provide support of space for students to dialogue about their experiences and recommend ways to continually improve our campus climate. In addition to these are pleased to share this evening other critical steps the universe is taking the foster inclusivity Kalpana Pomona. Recent campus measures include a standing university inclusive excellence council the will develop and recommend proactive strategies for strengthening our inclusive environment. An administrative campus climate response team to respond to campus climate related concerns in an integrated timely and transparent way. We recognize at all is it is may not rise to being unlawful the discipline may be awful. So how do we respond the bill's timely transparently inclusive. We're going campus complain policies and procedures to ensure clarity clarity for reporting pathways processes and transparency. Do an institutional membership all faculty members of university have access now to resources and support through the national center for faculty development and diversity. And it's in our will have a forty team- group of faculty staff and students going through training as well that's a nice step for the UCC issue. All of us working together and then we've also launching into city inclusivity theme speaker series cosponsored by academic affairs and student affairs so we're bringing in speakers not just the speaker released about conversations and what happens after we've heard the speech. And we are. We wants the researchers is a critical steps are campus to fill three new leadership roles at the campus dedicated to diversity and inclusion. Are the first of the presidential associate for equity diversity campus climate who report directly to the president serve as a member of the president's cabinet. Secondly we want to search for the executive director of student inclusion and belonging. Reporting to the vice president for student affairs with a secondary reporting line to the presidential associate. And third we are want to search for the faculty diversity out reach recruiter. Charter working with academic affairs in the colleges departments on extending our outreach efforts to increase awareness of the excellence. Of count Poly Pomona. And expand our diversity of our candidates. I can see that exists four minutes left. So I want to simply say that we are in the work we are in the space we are doing the working with the commitment which students with faculty staff and our alumni and thank you again dark to where it is a real pleasure to be with you to see it's always good to see Richard thank you. A doctor Libya hi everyone my name is doctor Cynthia- levo as mentioned I represent the California community college system the largest system of higher education in the world I represent community college students and one hundred and fifteen community colleges as well as the faculty staff and administration- from the chancellor's office I service the president of the chief student services officer association and I'm of the vice president of student services at Pasadena City College I want to say thank you to the students Irene- as an undergraduate students in nineteen eighty five order. Mystery Xin again. Proposition one eighty seven to nine into to see. It was a little- awakening. And I was really proud to hear you speak up on behalf of yourself and your your student your fellow students. I also want to say thank you to Reggie- my sister attended San Diego State University and I called Reggie and say Hey can you look out for my sis. And he did and you know that's what we want for all of you for all of our students across the state we want our students to feel comfortable to feel safe and to feel like they have a for media. A family that's looking out for them and that make sure they succeed and so I'm here to mention some of the efforts taken up by the California community college system. In twenty fourteen we begin funding what is called student equity throughout the one hundred and fifteen community colleges. Every college received an allocation in order to make changes to our practices to dismantle predominately white institution characteristics. And I'll I'll mention at the chief student services officer level we welcome to that with open arms for example last year we hosted a conference and Dr Sean Harper was our keynote speaker. This year we have doctor G. look good and doctors here brown McNair her new book is called from equity talk to act you walk. And we look forward to that. I work at Pasadena City College and a month ago we were featured in an article online in political magazine. And we were featured for our work in racial equity specifically- we closed racial equity gaps for Latino Latina and let the next students by ten percentage points in less than four years. How did we do that. We implemented an implicit bias training in our equal employment opportunity training which is mandatory for anybody who wants to serve on a hiring committee. Instead of doing legalese and death by power point from a legal perspective for compliance purposes only. We used it as an opportunity to help people understand and unpacked their own unconscious bias when they're going through applications and identifying candidates to hire. In doing so we've hired 15% more African American and Latin X. faculty on our campus. Additionally we implemented new faculty aye. Your long new faculty seminar which all new faculty participate in and it's based on cultural competence cultural relevance and cultural humility in the classroom. We partnered with doctor a stellar and Simone and over four hundred of our faculty staff and administrators on campus participated. In learning equity mind this we developed an equity data dashboard for our college than anybody in the public can see you can identify our racial equity gaps down to the course of all. In doing so we also it stirred three racial campus climate surveys one that was mentioned at the beginning our session today by Dr Charles Davis that was developed by Dr Sean Harper. The national assessment for collegiate campus climate second we administered a survey that was developed by two faculty members at San Diego State University doctors look word and Frank Harris the community college success measure. Finally we administered the higher education labor city survey and the head survey provided us with more insight what do we do with the data we allowed it to inform our professional development plans. Are hiring plans and to essentially inform what students need from us on our campus to feel a sense of belonging. I believe that we can continue to close our racial equity gaps by dismantling practices that were not designed for our students in the first place. And it is very possible to continue moving the needle on racial equity thank you very much thank you. I thank all of you for your- presentations- obviously our campuses have been. Engaged very busy in in addressing these issues obviously at different levels. Of June- and I know our time is up basically but I wanted to make sure those in the audience had an opportunity to make a statement- but- just a couple of things that- that I will I would say and you don't have to respond any ninety we have to respond to today but- over the last five years using a lot of activities that have occurred- you know a lot of program development a lot of resources put into it- efforts to hire a different individuals. Up I assume that in this process there's also an assessment of the effectiveness of will be doing a and I say that because I just had a an audit report today that came out of concerning. Local control funding for me one of the main things was no is not effort sensing within our done is the fact that we have lots of activity. Of lots of programs lots of goals and objectives and yet we don't stop and say that is ineffective. Let's not do it again this is effective let's do more of it- and I think that's that's that's because when I when I go to hear a lot of activity. And I would encourage I know it's hard these programs going but with. As an object system for you to be a certain period of time without with what you're doing and then be honest in the in assessing of which one of these actually **** which one a light. Would actually works to accomplish these goals I think would be helpful in. In determining how you spend the future dollars or future. First so the question becomes you know with the accountability for the programs that are there. Accountability for faculty for of changing behavior in a faculty- are we talking about if you did utilizing. That information as a part of assessment and evaluation of faculty determine tenure promotion. Those kinds of things- you know I mean where are we in terms of the seriousness of it because we can do a lot of programs. But until we begin to crack through the real difficult task which is making sure that. Not only we say what we want but we enforce what we want. We demonstrate that and I think that was some of the comments with the students here- they don't necessarily feel see the demonstration of it- especially if they've got. A police officer whose hard over and over and over again in the fact. Who continues teach over over over again and I've been a personal committees will people have love people because they both books. But yet the students comments were absolutely damaging and horrible that they were saying screaming through the valuations and these. Are people some of our students who got aids I had a in a class. I'm and as we kept saying that inner Bennett and the conversation was. She was he did the best book in anthropology this year. Okay but the students are saying he's horrible he's terrible you know don't put you back in the classroom again and we can't do it because our standards didn't really factory and their needs it factored into the institutions. Desire to have greater ratings for whatever who knows grants and so forth and so on self I think you know beginning to ask the question okay when. We've got these we obviously have these issues you know that of the year what we do is a system. Are the but those are hard questions that have to be passed in their hearts things to implement. You know I'm not naive to believe it that when you start crack in it. Professor tenure and promotion it should be dig into the heart of the institution- which may be cold in itself but none the less is the it's at the heart of the institution. So I hope that we get a chance to have a some conversation like that I would love to see what you're doing in terms of- accountability. And what and how far was going to get with that with regard to that so I really appreciate all of the work that you're doing in the evaluation is the year. But I given opportunity and what I would encourage each one of you- if that particular things that you think would be helpful to others that you make sure that our staff gets those things in terms of. Doing because we. Do keep all that mature. Will generate always general. The I will one of the few committees that. As an assessment. Of our of things if you could probably get. Of the men the past. A lot of those things do lead to legislation. And that's what we want to make sure that if the things we can do. To support- encourage- I know we did some things before with faculty diversity and try to make sure that was that was being done. All and we've we've done some funding in that area. So that it target said in and helps in some way- that would be I think extremely important. For us to know that that is that that's something that would be helpful- we've often talked about a system system wide assessment. Of like we do- with- what is a separate when trading everybody has to take that. We have yet to in a including. Players we have yet. The same kind of thing on racial issues. In terms of training across the system I know when I was chairman department state. At the take I don't know how many hours of. On the internet every. Every every. We don't have that with regards to racial. Situations which says. That is important as sexual harassment probably sell- and I'm just. So we need to look at that and maybe that's- we need to. Start thinking about. In terms of making sure our faculty- and administrators. That off their minds. That they have to be a conscious of that. As well as other kinds of biases that exist- it just sends a message that this is important it's not. You know that. We can invite up to have a comment to make.

And I'm the black community endorsed elected official in student government. I wanted to touch on some of the things that some of my colleagues had said earlier. First things first. And most importantly. Repeal prop two oh nine. It affects not only the affirmative action. Allowing students to attend universities. But also retention programs. And after those students getting here. Being able to have resources and programs. Increase the amount of diverse faculty because anti by straining could only go so far. As a black woman in the computer science. Department I'm not going to learn from another black woman before I graduate. And that is the problem. Increase the amount of students space and social cultural centers. Increase state funding to the UC CSU NCC so they can better support student programs. And scholarships. And most and finally. Demilitarize the U. CPD. Across all UC campuses because no school need the bomb truck. No school need automatic machinery that shrink to kill. And bill you see should have students. Who don't feel comfortable. On campus to learn. Thank you. Thank. You you did in fifty five seconds Hey EA. It's hard to follow my name is a corner room here with UC Berkeley I'm also ACC senator. Elected Burke campus wellness- and SB S. H. R. belated issue the basic needs. Are two things that I wanted to highlight is that basic needs is extremely important on campus we have students. Who are living in origins they sleep in our libraries they're eating out of trash cans living in vehicles like this is a reality on our campus. Have you seen this exacerbated with students of color particularly black students on campus over secure homeless in the past thirty days- in addition I want to touch upon like SB essays issues- we talk about this we bring this to the forefront very often but we don't acknowledge the fact that a lot of. Students who are impacted or Cutie folks Marge I spoke. And black identifying females on this campus and a lot of the times they get pushed out of the system they're not given a fair trial so also acknowledging that. And just pushing for more resources of the students that I'm I'm I'm also here to represent like the pre health community. And I can tell you the amount of like students. Who have dropped out from not. And we need like. We need more black arm people in academia and the only way to do this to support them thank you thank you. Hi my name is Amanda hell I am a freshman at UC Berkeley however today one to talk about mostly the doctor Reginald and- Mrs Freeman. About cal pipe alone of since I have a lot of friends to go there and I in fact almost went there- and their treatment of blacks vans- recently there has been a student action committee formed- against the mistreatment and micrographs and that black students are facing the classroom for example some of them don't feel welcome in residence halls- one person. There professor called different names depending on how our hair is- like almost rose or or Marley- other people somebody wrote **** on a white board in front of their dorm. And just elevating their voices and making sure that their heard and that something is being done to address this issue because the street in a black student. Especially at somewhere like how point. Where they're they're all these initiatives is unacceptable. Hello my name is Nathan my cell I am a commissioner on Berkeley's police review board- I just read this also through the UC Berkeley- often. Walk on campus in my first week size told her this was the number one book universe in the world the sundry times. I'm not sure how you can be number one when you were the worst for black students. Everyone there said it all the students sign for that said it. We can more when you walk around campus you off to see the- benefits a- what if in this generation weaker cancer what if we just our generation. We solve this great big problem well let's ask the same question when it comes to racial equity in our campuses. We can make big actions we can do big change we can repeal prop. Two oh nine we have to think big thank you. Thank you. October com thank you so much for putting this on. Hearing together obviously you've continue to be a champion for racial justice and equity at the state. Thank you for that. Are monies posh under the UC student association the stock number- and- I think I just want to highlight as many of our students said. Today public comment panel. We have a lot of issues to have to. Walk through- you see had a twenty fourteen serving their on campus climate. And there were a lot of issues that were highlighted in that. We continue to address these issues because they have not been fixed. Are we see those effects still to the very very real. And so we look forward to working with you. On that the area that we can especially one of them being. Increasing funding for equipment attention centers. That does and really good work was really fast up to addressing. These issues and so thank you for coming. Thank you. Good evening doctor Weber thank you so much for coming to UC Berkeley tonight my name is Marsha survey sure and I service the external affairs vice president of the east you see UC Berkeley students association. And I also service the president of the UC students association which represents over two hundred thousand undergraduates across our nine campuses. And on behalf of the UC students so she should I want to reiterate the importance of repealing prop two oh nine and doing it as soon. As possible students have been calling on this for years and years under represented communities marginalized communities on our campuses have been fighting for this for years. And years you see stern association has supported this probably longer than I have been alive so I'm calling on not just the legislature to take an active role in repealing this. But on members of our university leadership to call on this not just supported not just supporter quietly but actively and loudly demanded because it because it is a critical part. Of solving our campus climate crisis on our campuses thank you so much thank you. We thank all of you for coming today- I wanna make sure we thank those of students who from UC Berkeley. And from other campuses and staff for allowing us to hold a- hearing to today and I want to thank the committee members. And the panelists who provided their testimony. Of sharing with us updates and campus- efforts and address the bias in the various incidents that have occurred on. Campus it's always a painful to me I. Reflect back on the fact that it's been. Fifty three years since I entered as a freshman at UCLA. And of many of the fears and concerns and feelings of alienation and isolation. Was also felt by me fifty three years ago as a freshman. Of the probably the student population has an grown much since then. In terms of the percentage and so it is a- somewhat disheartening after so many years to. Still see that to on our UC campuses- particularly- we still have the- the issues in the concerns of the year and obviously. Going to address it. When I have to dress because we truly believe in it and fight for it. A much more than of give lip service in. Resources and what have you to it it's more than money- money helps of anything but it's more than money- is money is seldom solves any problem with that. When effort- to make it happen. Someone to do that. Press of. My appreciation all of your audiences. For the hearing for your input for your comments and hopefully for your continuing. Concern I have to staff I thank my staff that's around the room- who basically- were- did this. List thank god to me. Who is the chair of the- of. The campus climate comedian my office for me one of my staff. I'll home nor cal Y. Kaufman is here in the back Laurie- Jekyll. For sure it is here and is there anyone else on the staff. Miles is here miles is one of our student interns working with us this summer I want to thank those student interns in the back also with this last year- Maureen and- was was one of our student interns. Anyone else at lucky- there's lucky sitting there okay they were in a student interns in my office that. Gave us huh. Neon is here. Okay she's gonna think what I want to thank all of the student interns we've we've been very fortunate and blessed to have students who want to work in our office to come an intern with us and- and it's a really great experience one think I met who was in my- my young fellows. Program and legislators in sac and San Diego when he's in high school so I see all of my children scattered around the room- and that's a great thing- we hope we've given them some experiences in our office in I forgot. My oldest student. My oldest student when I was younger and he was younger too. But I always take pride in the fact that that my students to hopefully get more than- just a textbook learning but hopefully get lessons for life. And that's what's a really important because you can always access. Textbook material nowadays on the internet- and did and rather quickly but it's hard to access. The things that not to learn with the things that you feel. And that you know that have a tendency to guide your life- recent incidents in campus crime to remind us that the how much work is still to be done. And how much we need each one of us to do that work- one students arrive on campus they are welcome respected and safe. Whatever their background might be in is our hope that that will always be. The in the inside of the perspective that these campus hearings that we have. This is when I often make Sacramento will but we have inserted situations- or celebrations. I remind them of that the work that we do is forever. We always think that it'll in soon. That of that- as soon as we accomplish this everybody will be happy the world will be better. And everybody will love and respect the body heals but I remind everyone on the floor of the. Assembly as well as those throughout the cap. That. Concept of racial inclusion respect dignity those things that are valuable. I like rare flowers that have to be constantly nurtured in water. The love and attention. But hatred. And discrimination. Is a weed. I like most weeks it grows best in that collect. And so as soon as you turn your back on it and think you've accomplished something just like in your own garden at home. So as you put it in a look so pretty and you don't come back for a nother month. You will discover the weed is wrong with that picture care without your nurturing without your attention. And the work becomes harder the second time around. And so for all of us this is the work. That has to happen every day we have to be conscious and sensitive to the things that we say. That we see that we do we have to put in place policies that are responsive to the needs. And as those needs change we change policies to response to it. If that's the outcome we want. We want a garden at is gorgeous and beautiful and nurture and inspiring. And it requires constant attention. All the time. If not we will have a world as we sometimes feel we have. Feel would be. Because we all decided the work was finished. And we didn't water it again would impede into to it. And now it has over grown us and we're upset. The only thing we can do is get in once again. Are rooted out. And pay attention thank you so very much for coming
