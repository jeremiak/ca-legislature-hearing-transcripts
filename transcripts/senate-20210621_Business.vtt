THAT THERE ARE. THE PARTS OF

00:31:57.315 --> 00:31:58.449
OUR BODIES THAT DON'T NATURALLY

00:31:58.516 --> 00:32:02.287
DECOMPOSE- TEETH FILLINGS

00:32:02.353 --> 00:32:06.057
ASSUMED BONES. THAT SO HOW. HOW

00:32:06.124 --> 00:32:06.724

THE FIFTH BETWEEN PAID FOR

00:32:29.147 --> 00:32:30.682
TALKING ABOUT NON ORGANIC

00:32:30.748 --> 00:32:33.284
MATERIAL THAT- THAT AREN'T

00:32:33.351 --> 00:32:35.286
BROKEN DOWN DURING NATURAL

00:32:39.991 --> 00:32:41.793
NOT GOING TO MATERIALS AND IT'S

00:32:41.859 --> 00:32:42.727

00:32:44.295 --> 00:32:46.230
THE SAME RATE. AS OTHER PARTS

00:32:46.297 --> 00:32:50.268

TEETH ARE BROKEN DOWN. AND

00:32:55.907 --> 00:32:59.811
THAT'S A FACTOR OF. HI HI SPEED

00:32:59.877 --> 00:33:00.812
THAT CREATED DURING THE

00:33:00.878 --> 00:33:04.015
MICROBIAL ACTIVITY- AND TO

JUST ONE MORE EXAMPLE OF THAT

00:34:15.586 --> 00:34:16.954
THAT I THINK IT'S FASTING AND

TO BOIL IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:08.699
FURTHER- YOU KNOW IS IT THE

00:36:08.766 --> 00:36:11.636
SAME AS WHAT WE DO IS CREMATED

00:36:11.702 --> 00:36:14.672
ASHES OR ARE WE LOOKING AT SOME

00:36:14.739 --> 00:36:15.273
DIFFERENT SET OF CRITERIA AND

00:36:15.339 --> 00:36:18.776
GUIDANCE. ACCEPTED AT THIS IN

00:36:18.843 --> 00:36:20.278
MY VISION IT WOULD BE SIMILAR

00:36:20.344 --> 00:36:22.947
RETURN RETURN THESE- THE SOIL

00:36:23.014 --> 00:36:24.048
BACK TO THE FAMILY AND THEY GET

00:36:24.115 --> 00:36:26.350
TO. PUT IT IN RECENT RIGHT

00:36:26.417 --> 00:36:27.151
THERE STILL RULES AND

00:36:27.218 --> 00:36:28.119
REGULATIONS THAT YOU NEED TO

00:36:28.185 --> 00:36:30.221
FALL EVEN FALL EVEN WITH YOUR

00:36:30.288 --> 00:36:32.223
AND YOUR FAMILY'S ASHES. I

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:33.224
THINK THE SAME THING WITH THE

00:36:33.291 --> 00:36:34.659
WITH THE SOIL TO THE DEPARTMENT

00:36:34.725 --> 00:36:36.794
WOULD CREATE GUIDELINES OF WHAT

00:36:36.861 --> 00:36:39.964
THAT HI HE SAID AND MAYBE TO- I

00:36:40.031 --> 00:36:41.599
APOLOGIZE WHAT WE NEED TO

00:36:41.666 --> 00:36:42.934
DISCLOSE HIS WEALTH WITH IT'S

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:43.868
HAPPENING HOW YOU REGISTER

00:36:43.935 --> 00:36:45.570
THAT. SO THIS IS ALL PART OF

00:36:45.636 --> 00:36:46.837
WHAT THE BUREAU WOULD HAVE TO

00:36:46.904 --> 00:36:48.739
DEVELOP- BUT I THINK IT'S

00:36:48.806 --> 00:36:49.974
CREATING AN OPTION I THINK

00:36:50.041 --> 00:36:51.542
CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN

00:36:51.609 --> 00:36:52.877
FAMILY MEMBERS OF WHAT WE DO AT

00:36:52.944 --> 00:36:53.945
THE END OF OUR LIFE AND IT'S A

00:36:54.011 --> 00:36:55.212
CONVERSATION THAT OFTEN TEND TO

00:36:55.279 --> 00:36:57.648
OUR FATE. TO HAVE- I'M THE

00:36:57.715 --> 00:36:58.716
CARETAKER FOR MY PARENTS AND

00:36:58.783 --> 00:37:00.017
FROM MY UNCLE INTO THE

00:37:00.084 --> 00:37:00.618
CONVERSATION I'VE BEEN

00:37:00.685 --> 00:37:02.620
CONFRONTED WITH- FOR THE LAST

00:37:02.687 --> 00:37:04.121
TEN YEARS SINCE I'VE HAD TO

00:37:04.188 --> 00:37:04.855
DEAL WITH A WHOLE HOST OF THE

00:37:04.922 --> 00:37:06.724
HEALTH CRISIS OUT WITH THEM AND

00:37:06.791 --> 00:37:08.559
SO. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT WE

00:37:08.626 --> 00:37:09.493
ARE TRYING TO CREATE A SPACE

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:10.528
WHERE WE KEEP COMMUNITIES

00:37:10.595 --> 00:37:11.829
HELPING SAVE CREATURES OF

00:37:11.896 --> 00:37:13.297
FAMILIES BUT WORKING WITH THE

00:37:13.364 --> 00:37:14.599
DEPARTMENT AND OUR EXPERTS OF

00:37:14.665 --> 00:37:15.466
WELL YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE

00:37:15.533 --> 00:37:18.002
BEST YEAH AND THEN IT'S JUST A

00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:19.937
QUICK FOLLOW UP ON THAT- I

00:37:20.004 --> 00:37:21.606
DIDN'T SEE THIS AND MAYBE I

00:37:21.672 --> 00:37:22.707
JUST MISSED IT I APOLOGIZE IF

00:37:22.773 --> 00:37:25.443
SO- IS THERE. GUIDANCE THAT

00:37:25.509 --> 00:37:29.146
YOU'RE PROVIDING TO THE BUREAU

00:37:29.213 --> 00:37:31.349
OTHER THAN JUST A SORT OF ADOPT

00:37:31.415 --> 00:37:32.516
THE SAME GUIDELINES EXCLAMATION

00:37:32.583 --> 00:37:34.652
I ONLY ASK THAT BECAUSE- I

00:37:34.719 --> 00:37:36.120
THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE IN MY

00:37:36.187 --> 00:37:38.189
DISTRICT IN MY COMMUNITY. AND

00:37:38.255 --> 00:37:39.056
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE DIFFERENT

00:37:39.123 --> 00:37:40.024
RELIGIONS DIFFERENT CULTURES

00:37:40.091 --> 00:37:41.926
WITH DIFFERENT ATTITUDES ON ON

00:37:41.993 --> 00:37:43.861
DEATH AND REMAINS THAT MIGHT

00:37:43.928 --> 00:37:46.097
VIEW THESE TYPES OF REMAINS IS

00:37:46.163 --> 00:37:48.733
DIFFERENT THAN ASHES AND TO

00:37:48.799 --> 00:37:50.134
ECHO MY COLLEAGUE FROM

00:37:50.201 --> 00:37:51.869
SACRAMENTO'S POINT. THAT THEY

00:37:51.936 --> 00:37:54.505
MIGHT HAVE LEGITIMATE RELIGIOUS

00:37:54.572 --> 00:37:56.040
OR CULTURAL OR SPIRITUAL

00:37:56.107 --> 00:37:57.875
CONCERNS ABOUT HAVING THESE

00:37:57.942 --> 00:38:04.582
TYPES. REMAINS LIKE RIGHT NEAR

00:38:04.649 --> 00:38:05.549
THEM AND I GUESS- I'M I'M KERRY

00:38:05.616 --> 00:38:06.917
IF THERE A- GUIDANCE THAT GOES

00:38:06.984 --> 00:38:08.452
ABOVE AND BEYOND JUST. THE IT

00:38:08.519 --> 00:38:10.254
POLICY. WORKING IN. TO BE TODAY

00:38:10.321 --> 00:38:16.060
THEIR- AND POLICIES. I LOVE

00:38:16.127 --> 00:38:17.762
THAT MADE SENSE AND I TALKED.

00:38:17.828 --> 00:38:19.163
EARLY ON A MONDAY NO I MEAN I

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:20.197
UNDERSTAND I THINK THE

00:38:20.264 --> 00:38:21.599
DISCUSSION ALSO ON WHAT PEOPLE

00:38:21.666 --> 00:38:22.767
ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THE NOT

00:38:22.833 --> 00:38:23.934
COMFORTABLE WITH THAT WHAT WE

00:38:24.001 --> 00:38:25.603
DISCLOSED TO THE PUBLIC AND NOT

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:27.071
AND I THINK THAT THERE SHOULD

00:38:27.138 --> 00:38:28.272
BE A LEVEL OF THIS CLOSER THAT

00:38:28.339 --> 00:38:31.575
IS. OUT THERE- AND THAT IS A

00:38:31.642 --> 00:38:33.511
FAIR DISCUSSION TO BE HAD THE

00:38:33.577 --> 00:38:36.047
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH I WOULD BE

00:38:36.113 --> 00:38:38.082
WORKING WITH THE BUREAU ON WHAT

00:38:38.149 --> 00:38:39.684
THESE WHAT THE REGULATIONS ARE

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:41.052
LOOK LIKE THEY USED TO HAVE AN

00:38:41.118 --> 00:38:42.720
OPEN PROCESS I THINK IT GIVES

00:38:42.787 --> 00:38:47.158
PEOPLE SPACE TO PARTICIPATE. IN

00:38:47.224 --> 00:38:48.993
THAT AS WELL. ALONG THE WAY.

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:50.895
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RELIGION-

00:38:50.961 --> 00:38:52.363
YOU KNOW THE CATHOLIC CHURCH TO

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:53.564
SOMEONE IS TO BE CREMATED

00:38:53.631 --> 00:38:56.600
EITHER- AND SO. IT'S AND PEOPLE

00:38:56.667 --> 00:38:57.535
STILL MAKE THAT CHOICE EVEN

00:38:57.601 --> 00:38:58.903
WITHIN THAT RELIGION BECAUSE IT

00:38:58.969 --> 00:39:00.104
MIGHT BE WORTH IT FOR THEM AND-

00:39:00.171 --> 00:39:01.472
THEIR FAMILIES AND WHAT THEY DO

00:39:01.539 --> 00:39:02.440
WITH THE FASCIST. THAT THE

00:39:02.506 --> 00:39:04.275
DISCUSSION. OFTEN TIME WITH

00:39:04.341 --> 00:39:05.209
FAMILY MEMBERS OUT THERE WHAT

00:39:05.276 --> 00:39:07.578
HAPPENS. NEXT AND SO I THINK

00:39:07.645 --> 00:39:09.613
IT'S FAIR THAT. WE KNOW WHAT'S

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:12.049
IN OUR BACKYARD LITERALLY. NINE

00:39:12.116 --> 00:39:12.983
FIFTEEN THAT DISCLOSURES FOR I

00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:14.518
WILL SAY FOR EXAMPLE TO THIS

00:39:14.585 --> 00:39:16.520
BILL LET DISCOVERED. THAT WERE

00:39:16.587 --> 00:39:17.988
ALLOWED TO BURY IT TO FIVE

00:39:18.055 --> 00:39:19.356
PEOPLE IN A BACKYARD IN THIS

00:39:19.423 --> 00:39:20.458
YOUR CITY OR COUNTY HAS PASSED

00:39:20.524 --> 00:39:22.126
AN ORDINANCE THAT. MODIFIES

00:39:22.193 --> 00:39:23.994
THAT HE DO THE RIGHT TO SAY

00:39:24.061 --> 00:39:24.862
THAT AND PEOPLE MIGHT NOT KNOW

00:39:24.929 --> 00:39:26.263
THAT THIS IS NEXT TO YOU IN

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:27.331
YOUR PRIVATE PROPERTY OUT

00:39:27.398 --> 00:39:28.699
THERE. AND SO I THINK THERE'S A

00:39:28.766 --> 00:39:30.167
LOT OF SPACES WHERE WE EXPECTED

00:39:30.234 --> 00:39:34.371
AND THINGS AND THERE'S ACTUALLY.

00:39:34.438 --> 00:39:34.939
A LOT MORE LATITUDE THAN WE

00:39:35.005 --> 00:39:35.506
WOULD REALIZE. I APPRECIATE

00:39:35.573 --> 00:39:37.274
THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR

00:39:37.341 --> 00:39:41.879
HELLO OKAY SIR ARCHULETA- YES-

00:39:41.946 --> 00:39:43.447
QUESTION PROBABLY FOR THE

00:39:43.514 --> 00:39:45.349
DIRECTOR THE FUNERAL HOME MORE

00:39:45.416 --> 00:39:47.785
THAN THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER- ACT

00:39:47.852 --> 00:39:48.352
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF SHE

00:39:48.419 --> 00:39:49.887
WOULD HAVE KNOWLEDGE IN THIS

00:39:49.954 --> 00:39:52.356
THE PROCEDURE- WE TALKED ABOUT

00:39:52.423 --> 00:39:54.759
THE FAMILIES AND- THE

00:39:54.825 --> 00:39:57.027
SENSITIVITY THE FAMILIES WOULD

00:39:57.094 --> 00:40:00.464
WOULD THERE BE A NORMAL-

00:40:00.531 --> 00:40:02.533
VANTAGE AS WE ALL ARE CUT FROM

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:05.436
THE SCENE AND THEN THIRTY DAYS

00:40:05.503 --> 00:40:07.538
LATER WHEN IT'S COMPLETE IS

00:40:07.605 --> 00:40:11.041
THERE ANOTHER CEREMONY- CAN YOU

00:40:11.108 --> 00:40:13.077
WALK ME THROUGH WHAT WOULD BE.

00:40:13.144 --> 00:40:15.846
A SORT OF A CEREMONY I MEAN IT-

00:40:15.913 --> 00:40:18.783
USUALLY THERE'S GRAVESITE AND

00:40:18.849 --> 00:40:23.020
THEN THE CASKET IS- IS PUT IN

00:40:23.087 --> 00:40:25.022
THE GROUND OR THERE'S- YOU KNOW

00:40:25.089 --> 00:40:26.657
WHAT WHAT WHAT EXACTLY WHAT

00:40:26.724 --> 00:40:29.260
WOULD TAKE PLACE WHEN WITH THE

00:40:29.326 --> 00:40:31.362
FAMILIES ACTUALLY MOURN WOULD

00:40:31.428 --> 00:40:34.832
IT BE AT THE END OF THIRTY DAYS

00:40:34.899 --> 00:40:35.399
IN THE BEGINNING. WHAT'S THE

00:40:35.466 --> 00:40:36.767
PROCEDURE I GUESS WHAT SO LET'S

00:40:36.834 --> 00:40:39.403
HAVE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER ERIC

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:40.037
THAT AND THEN RE DIRECT THAT IF

00:40:40.104 --> 00:40:41.672
YOU WOULD. I DON'T KNOW WHO'S

00:40:41.739 --> 00:40:45.743
ON THE LINE AT ALL ALL. AT ONE

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:46.577
THIRTY THAT FUNERAL DIRECTOR SO

00:40:46.644 --> 00:40:48.245
I CAN I CAN STEP IN WHATEVER'S

00:40:48.312 --> 00:40:51.248
APPROPRIATE. YES AND I WOULD

00:40:51.315 --> 00:40:52.917
SAY WHEN WE MOURN OUR FAMILY

00:40:52.983 --> 00:40:55.152
MEMBER AUSTIN TEXAS UP TO THAT.

00:40:55.219 --> 00:40:56.320
FOR FAMILY MEMBERS AND THAT'S A

00:40:56.387 --> 00:40:57.421
DISCUSSION THAT HAPPENS OFTEN

00:40:57.488 --> 00:40:58.689
TIMES WITH CREMATION DO WE DO

00:40:58.756 --> 00:40:59.990
IT AHEAD OF TIME AFTERWARDS WE

00:41:00.057 --> 00:41:02.326
DO WE DO IT TWICE. I'VE I'VE

00:41:02.393 --> 00:41:04.328
I'VE HAD. I PARTICIPATED IN

00:41:04.395 --> 00:41:05.663
VARIATIONS OF THAT AS WELL BUT

00:41:05.729 --> 00:41:09.633
I WILL ALLOW THE DIRECTOR TO

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:12.069
CHAIRMAN. AND DIRECTOR. YEAH

00:41:12.136 --> 00:41:13.704
THAT'S A FANTASTIC QUESTION AND

00:41:13.771 --> 00:41:15.639
THIS IS A REALLY FASCINATING

00:41:15.706 --> 00:41:17.141
TIME TO BE A PART OF THE

00:41:17.208 --> 00:41:19.176
FUNERAL INDUSTRY. BECAUSE

00:41:19.243 --> 00:41:20.845
THINGS ARE CHANGING AND THERE

00:41:20.911 --> 00:41:22.847
ARE NEW IDEAS AND WE HAVE

00:41:22.913 --> 00:41:23.914
DIFFERENT RELIGIONS AND

00:41:23.981 --> 00:41:25.349
DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE

00:41:25.416 --> 00:41:27.084
DIFFERENT WAYS OF DOING IT. BUT

00:41:27.151 --> 00:41:29.086
AS I WILL SAY I DO MOSTLY

00:41:29.153 --> 00:41:32.289
CREMATION. OR NATURAL BURIALS

00:41:32.356 --> 00:41:32.923
WHICH IS JUST A BOTTOM STRAIGHT

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:36.660
INTO THE GROUND- AND- NORMALLY

00:41:36.727 --> 00:41:38.195
WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT YOU TEND

00:41:38.262 --> 00:41:39.630
TO HAVE A VIEWING AFTER THE

00:41:39.697 --> 00:41:41.031
TONE BECAUSE PEOPLE DO YOU WANT

00:41:41.098 --> 00:41:43.500
TO BE WITH THE PHYSICAL BODY.

00:41:43.567 --> 00:41:44.668
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

00:41:44.735 --> 00:41:46.904
LOVE SO MUCH ABOUT THE IDEA OF

00:41:46.971 --> 00:41:48.906
NATURAL ORGANIC REDUCTION IS

00:41:48.973 --> 00:41:51.809
THAT POLICING THE BODY INTO THE

00:41:51.876 --> 00:41:54.612
VESSEL. TO BE TO BE REDUCED TO

00:41:54.678 --> 00:41:58.282
SOIL. IS SUCH A- BEAUTIFUL

00:41:58.349 --> 00:42:00.251
CALMING WAY BECAUSE CREMATORY

00:42:00.317 --> 00:42:01.685
LET'S BE HONEST TEND TO BE VERY

00:42:01.752 --> 00:42:04.355
LOUD TEND TO BE VERY INDUSTRIAL

00:42:04.421 --> 00:42:05.956
SO WHEN WE HAVE FAMILIES COME

00:42:06.023 --> 00:42:07.458
TO WITNESS THE BODY BEING

00:42:07.524 --> 00:42:08.492
PLACED INTO THE CREMATION

00:42:08.559 --> 00:42:12.363
CHAMBER. SOMETIMES I CAN BE A

00:42:12.429 --> 00:42:12.997
PRETTY INTENSE EXPERIENCE. BUT

00:42:13.063 --> 00:42:14.665
IT'S SO MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE

00:42:14.732 --> 00:42:16.200
THAN A TRADITIONAL BURIAL AND

00:42:16.267 --> 00:42:17.668
GRAVESIDE SERVICE THAT A LOT OF

00:42:17.735 --> 00:42:19.303
FAMILIES YOU KNOW HOW TO CHOOSE

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:20.804
CREMATION BUT IN THIS CASE.

00:42:20.871 --> 00:42:22.139
BEING ABLE TO CHOOSE NATURAL

00:42:22.206 --> 00:42:23.908
ORGANIC PRODUCTION MEANS THEY

00:42:23.974 --> 00:42:26.644
HAVE A MUCH. NICER ABILITY TO

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:29.580
HAVE A CEREMONY PRIOR TO THE

00:42:29.647 --> 00:42:30.681
BODY BEING INSERTED INTO THE

00:42:30.748 --> 00:42:32.716
VESSEL AND THEN AFTER THE

00:42:32.783 --> 00:42:33.984
THIRTY DAYS ONCE THE SOIL COMES

00:42:34.051 --> 00:42:35.419
BACK. YOU CAN HAVE A MEMORIAL

00:42:35.486 --> 00:42:36.720
SERVICE SIMILAR TO WHAT

00:42:36.787 --> 00:42:38.422
HAPPENED AFTER CREMATION FOR

00:42:38.489 --> 00:42:40.691
THE ASHES ARE SCATTERED. AND A

00:42:40.758 --> 00:42:42.326
QUICK- RETURNS WHAT WE WERE

00:42:42.393 --> 00:42:44.061
TALKING ABOUT EARLIER WITH THE

00:42:44.128 --> 00:42:45.829
DISCUSSION I BELIEVE THAT IT

00:42:45.896 --> 00:42:47.531
WILL BE VERY SIMILAR TO HOW

00:42:47.598 --> 00:42:49.166
CREMATED REMAINS ARE HANDLED

00:42:49.233 --> 00:42:50.334
CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY HAS SOME OF

00:42:50.401 --> 00:42:52.436
THE MOST STRICT LAWS AROUND

00:42:52.503 --> 00:42:54.438
HANDLING THE CREMATED REMAINS.

00:42:54.505 --> 00:42:56.273
PRIOR OR AFTER THE CREMATION

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:58.042
TAKES PLACE THAN ANY OTHER

00:42:58.108 --> 00:43:00.077
STATE SO I IMAGINE THE SAME

00:43:00.144 --> 00:43:01.545
SORT OF STRICT LAWS AND PERMITS

00:43:01.612 --> 00:43:03.113
AND PROCEDURES WILL ALSO BE

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:07.718
CARRIED OVER INTO. THE HANDLING

00:43:07.785 --> 00:43:09.586
OF THESE ORGANIC REMAINS. THANK

00:43:09.653 --> 00:43:11.855
