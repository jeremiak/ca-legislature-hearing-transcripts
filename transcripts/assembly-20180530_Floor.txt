CALIFORNIA'S OUTDOOR RECREATION ECONOMY IS THE LARGEST IN THE UNITED STATES GENERATING OVER NINETY TWO BILLION AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS AND CREATING MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND. DIRECT JOBS. SPECIFICALLY THIS OFFICE WILL HELP PLAN AND IMPLEMENT COORDINATED STRATEGIES TO DEVELOP JOBS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE OUTDOOR RECREATION INDUSTRY.

ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY TO FORTY NINE BY THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY AND ACTUALLY TWO ATTORNEYS MISTER STONE EMAIL BUT. I THINK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS THIS IS THE ANNUAL BAR DO SPILL THAT GOES TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE EVERY YEAR. IF YOU BEN. WATCHING THIS BILL THE LAST COUPLE YEARS WE'VE HAD A HECK OF A FIGHT ABOUT REFORMING THE CALIFORNIA STATE BAR THIS BILL FURTHER IMPLEMENTS THOSE REFORMS. AS WELL AS LOOKING AT DEEPER INTO ISSUES OF ATTORNEY DISCIPLINE AND ENSURING THAT THE BAR IS FUNCTIONING FOR ITS PRIMARY PURPOSE WHICH IS PROTECTING THE PUBLIC IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL PROVISION IN HERE THAT I WANT TO POINT OUT TO YOU AND THAT IS AN AUDIT PROVISION. IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE BAR IS GOING TO BE COMING BACK TO US NEXT YEAR ASKING FOR AN INCREASE. AND THE DUES THAT THEY CHARGE ATTORNEYS AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATE INFORMATION BEFORE US IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT WE. HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE TO TO WEIGH IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER ON THE INCREASE ARGUES THAT WE EXPECT TO BE PROPOSED NEXT YEAR SO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PROVISION OF IT. THE REST OF IT IS IS REALLY WORKING THROUGH THE FUNCTION OF THE BAR AND ENSURING THAT THEY'RE BEING RESPONSIBLE. LOOKING AT DIVERSITY ENSURING THAT THAT ATTORNEYS ARE PROVIDING THE SERVICES ESPECIALLY IN UNDERSERVED AREAS THAT THEY NEED TO SO THIS IS A THE LOT OF THE WORK AND I WANT TO THANK THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHO HAVE BEEN VERY VERY ENGAGED. IN THIS BILL AS IT HAS MOVED THROUGH AND VERY VERY ENGAGED IN THE BAR DISCUSSIONS AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTES. THANK YOU MICHELLE. SEE NO DISCUSSION DEBATE ON THE ITEM.

ASSEMBLY BILL NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN BY SOMETHING MEMBER SANTIAGO AND ACTUALLY THE PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT. PICTURE SANTIAGO THINKING WAS SPEAKER AB NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN WERE STANDARDIZE AND CLARIFIES EXISTING LINE PACKING PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYEES. EMPLOYER REALIZATIONS WITH REGARD EXISTING PAYROLL DEDUCTION DUTIES. AB NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN BROUGH REVISING RECAST. STATUES AFFECTING PUBLIC EMPLOYEES WITH REGARDS TO PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS TO STANDARD THE PROCESSES REQUIREMENTS FOR BOTH EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES ORGANIZATIONS. NOTHING IN A. B. NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN DEPARTURE FROM CURRENT LAW AND PRACTICES IN THIS CONSISTENT A BASIC PHILOSOPHY STRUCTURE. OF COLLECTING BARGAINING STATUES AND THE POLICIES IN CALIFORNIA. CURRENTLY THERE'S NO OPPOSITION I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE. MISTER HARPER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. EUGENE UNION AGENCY FEES VIOLATE THE FIRST AMENDMENT. RIGHTS OF WORKERS I BELIEVE THE U. S. SUPREME COURT WILL AGREE WITH ME WHEN THEY DID GIVE THE RULING. IN THE CASE OF JANICE PURSES ASKED ME. IN ANTICIPATION OF THEIR LOSS UNIONS ARE PUTTING FORTH LEGISLATION LIKE THIS BILL TO MAKE IT TOUGHER FOR HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS TO OPT OUT OF PAYING DUES. AND AVOID PAYING AGENCY FEES UNDER A. B. NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN WORKERS WOULD HAVE TO SUBMIT A CANCELLATION REQUEST. OF THE AUTO DEDUCTION OF THEIR DUES TO A UNION NOT THEIR EMPLOYER. THIS WOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR UNIONS TO NOT AYE THOSE REQUESTS AND KEEP ON COLLECTING THOSE DUES KEEPING THE PIPELINE FLOWING. THE UNIONS UNDERSTAND THAT IF WORKERS OPT OUT OF DUES THEN THE RESULTS OF JANET'S WILL ALLOW WORKERS TO AVOID AGENCY FEES. AND HER THE POLITICAL POWER OF UNIONS. WE NEED TO STOP PUTTING UP ROADBLOCKS THE DELAY THE INEVITABLE. RULING OF JANICE VERSUS ASKED ME. AND QUIT VIOLATING THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS OF MILLIONS OF WORKERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I URGE YOU ALL TO VOTE NO ON THIS BILL. SEEING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION. OUR DEBATE. OR SANTIAGO YOU MAY CLOSE IF YOU WISH. I THINK YOU MISTER SPEAKER WHILE APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE THEM TO BE VERY CLEAR. THAT THIS SEEKS TO STANDARDIZE AND CLARIFY EXISTING LAW THAT IMPACTS PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYEES AND ORGANIZATIONS. AS IT RELATES TO CURRENTLY THE WAY THEY DO PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS. OUT WE ARE NOT TRYING TO AFFECT. ANY DECISIONS ANYWHERE AND QUITE FRANKLY WE COULDN'T EVEN IF WE WANTED TO. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. WITH THAT CLERK LIBERAL. MEMBERS. HE'S ARE TO VOTE ON MEMBERS VOTER DESIRE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTE DESIRE TO VOTE. CLERK WILL. CLOSER ROLE. UNTIL I OF OF. I FORTY FIVE. KNOWS TWENTY THREE. THAT MEASURE PASSES. MEMBERS WERE GONNA BACK IN THE FILE. TAKE UP FILE ITEM NUMBER THIRTY EIGHT. THAT IS AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOR THIS IS FILE ITEM THIRTY EIGHT ABA. EIGHTY FOUR BY MISTER CALDERON. COOPERATE. ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR BUY SOME THE AMBER CALDERON AND OTHERS AND ACTUALLY TO FOOD FACILITIES MISTER CALDERON. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS MEMBERS ARE KEEP THIS BRIEF THIS IS MY STRAWS UPON REQUEST BILL. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS THAT WHEN YOU GO TO A DINING RESTAURANT. AND YOU WANT A STRAW YOU CAN HAVE IT YOU JUST HAVE TO ASK FOR IT. THAT'S IT MUCH LIKE WE DO HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHEN YOU WANT SOME WATER AND YOU GO TO A DINING RESTAURANT. YOU WANT A GLASS OF WATER YOU JUST HAVE TO REQUEST IT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE DID. I'M WE PUT IN A PLACE BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO THE DROUGHT. SINGLE USE PLASTIC IS A MAJOR DETRIMENT TO OUR OCEAN. LANDFILLS WATERWAYS ARE ALL OVER THE WORLD THE E. WAS ACTUALLY TAKEN ACTION VERY RECENTLY THE BAND THE SINGLE USE CLASSICS LIKE STRAWS. AND CUTLERY BECAUSE OF THEIR DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT WE JUST HAD A WHALE. AGAIN WASH UP ON TO OUR BEACHES HERE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WITH A STOMACH FULL OF PLASTIC OUT AND IT DIED BECAUSE A LOT OF THE RESULT OF ALL THAT PLASTIC. IN ITS STOMACH BY THE YEAR TWENTY FIFTY THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE PLASTIC IN THE OCEAN THEN THERE ARE FISH BY WEIGHT. REGARDLESS IF I YOU THINK IT'S A SILLY IDEA OR NOT OR OR MAYBE A NON ISSUE OR NOT IT IS A REAL ISSUE THAT IS AFFECTING. ALL THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE LIVE AND WE HAVE THE WORLD THE MAJORITY OF THE WORLD THAT RECEIVES ITS FOOD. FROM THE OCEAN ARE AND WE HAVE THESE FISH ADDS HIS MEET THESE THESE MARINE LIFE THAT ARE TAKING IN THE PLASTIC IN THE CLASS AGAIN AND WE IN TURN. EAT THOSE FISH THAT HAVE IN JUST ABOUT PLASTIC IT IS A BIG ISSUE IT'S A SMALL STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND WHERE WE ARE. IT RAISES A LOT AWARENESS A LOT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE STARTIN TO I CATCH ON IT AND IMPLEMENT A FEW OF THEIR OWN POLICIES ON SINGLE USE PLASTIC ITEMS LIKE CUTLERY STRAWS ON THE ROUND. UP BUT THIS IS A GREAT POLICY THERE IS NO OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL THE PLASTIC INDUSTRY IS NOT OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. THE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION IS NOT OPPOSED TO THIS BILL IT'S A GOOD BILL THAT DOES. GOOD THINGS ARE WITH NO OPPOSITION SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR. THEY WAS CALDERON MISTER BLOOM CORRECTNESS. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR THIS BILL IS ABOUT CHANGING THE BEHAVIOR OF NOT ONLY CONSUMERS BUT. RESTAURANTS AND HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU BEEN TO A RESTAURANT EVERY SINGLE DRINK. COMES BACK WITH A NEW STRAW. THIS S THE OUT WASTEFUL IT'S UNNECESSARY WE USE OVER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION EVERY DAY IN AMERICA AND MOST OF THOSE AND UP. IN THE OCEAN OR IN LANDFILL POLLUTING THE WATER AND KILLING MARINE LIFE WHEN THEY ARE IN THE OCEAN. IT'S ESTIMATED THAT SEVENTY ONE PERCENT OF SEA BIRDS AND THIRTY PERCENT OF TURTLES HAVE BEEN FOUND WITH PLASTICS IN THEIR STOMACHS. THINK ABOUT THOSE STATISTICS WHEN THEY INGEST PLASTIC MARINE LIFE HAS A FIFTY PERCENT MORTALITY RATE. CONTRARY TO WHAT YOU MIGHT THINK. PLASTIC STRAWS ARE NOT ROUTINELY RECYCLED AS MUCH YOUR THEIR THEIR TO LIGHT WEIGHT TO MAKE IT THROUGH TO ME CANTICLE RECYCLING SHORTER. DROP THROUGH THE SORTING SCREENS AND MIX WITH OTHER MATERIALS THAT ARE TOO SMALL TO SEPARATE AND SO THEY END UP CONTAMINATING RECYCLING LOADS OR GETTING DISPOSED OF AS GARBAGE. IF WE DON'T ACT NOW BY THE YEAR TWENTY FIFTY. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN AND PREDICTED. THAT THERE WILL BE MORE PLASTIC IN THE OCEAN THEN FINISH. THIS BILL ALONG WITH OTHER PLASTIC MARINE DEBRIS BILLS WE HAVE BEFORE US ARE HELPING US TO CURB. OUR ADDICTION TO SINGLE USE PLASTICS. AND HELP US MOVE TOWARD USING THINGS THAT ARE MORE SUSTAINABLE AND LESS DAMAGING I ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT THIS BILL. THINGS BLOOM SHARPER HERE RECOMMENDS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS LITTERING IS A HUGE PROBLEM IN THIS STATE. BUT RATHER THAN GO AFTER THE OFFENDERS A. B. EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR PLACES THE BLAME ON RESTAURANTS. THIS IS ANOTHER REASON WHY CALIFORNIA IS MAKING IT HARDER. FOR BUSINESSES TO OPERATE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. MOST OF THESE RESTAURANTS SERVE BEER WINE COFFEE WHICH DO NOT REQUIRE A STRAW TO DRINK. THE REAL PROBLEM IS WHEN CUSTOMERS GET FAST FOOD AND DUMP THEIR TRASH. ON THE GROUND AT A PARK. AND THE BEACH OR LONG A HIKING TRAIL. UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL PROVIDES AN EXEMPTION FOR THOSE TYPES OF RESTAURANTS AND DOES NOT PUNISH THE OFFENDERS. IF WE REALLY WANT TO CLEAN UP OUR OCEANS IN OUTDOOR AREAS THEN WE NEED TO CRIMINALIZE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR TRASHING OUR STATE. THE LITERATURES AND NOT. THE INNOCENT RESTAURANT OWNERS. I BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS INDEED A SLIPPERY SLOPE. THE WAY THIS BILL WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN. WAS RIDICULOUS AND I THINK THIS IS JUST AN INCREMENTAL A STEP TOWARDS THAT. THIS REMINDS ME OF WHAT I WAS ON THE HUNTINGTON BEACH CITY COUNCIL. AND IF IT WASN'T ONE THING IT WAS ANOTHER WAS THE BAND OF THE MONTH CLUB AND THEY ALWAYS ADD SOME BECAUSE SOMETHING TO BAN EVERY SINGLE YEAR THEY WOULD TRAVEL FROM SAN DIEGO TO SANTA MONICA ALONG THE COASTAL CITIES. AND WHETHER THEY WERE PEDDLING A PLASTIC BAG BAN OR WHETHER THEY WERE PEDDLING A STYROFOAM BAN OR WHETHER THEY'RE PEDDLING THIS KIND OF LEGISLATION. THAT IS WHAT THEY WERE TRYING TO DO TO JUSTIFY THEIR POLITICAL ACTIVISM. LET'S SAY NO TO THIS NANNY STATE BILL AND VOTE AGAINST A. B. EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR. MR LOW YOUR RECOMMENDS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I APPRECIATE THE OF THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE FOR. CHIU FACTOR YESTERDAY I WAS ADDS MOURNS JUST DOWN THE STREET WITH A FEW MEMBERS AND WE ASKED OF THE SERVER ABOUT HER PERSPECTIVE ON THIS BILL BECAUSE WE SAW. THAT SHE INDEED DID NOT PROVIDE ANY STRAWS AND THE FACT SHE SAID SHE WAS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF SUCH MEASURES THESE ARE PRETTY CONSISTENT WITH THE CONVERSATIONS THAT I'VE HAD WITH THE NUMBER OF CONSTITUENTS. AND WITH RESPECT TO SOME PREVIOUS COMMENTS MADE FROM SOME OF OUR OTHER COLLEAGUES THERE STILL PROVIDE SOME. PROTECTIONS IN OPTIONS IN PLACE FOR. THIS OPTION TO OCCUR AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF MISINFORMATION ON THIS BILL BUT. AT HAND THAT PROVIDES OPTIONS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER LOWE. SEEING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION DEBATE ON THE ITEM. MISTER CALDERON YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION AND THE SENTIMENTS SHARED I ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUE FROM HUNTINGTON BEACH IF YOU'D LIKE TO DO A BAN ON ALL PLASTIC STRAWS INCLUDING FROM. IT'S A FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS I I WOULD SUPPORT THAT EFFORT IN BACK IN ONE HUNDRED PERCENT I'M GLAD HE'S PASSING ABOUT THAT ISSUE WOULD LIKE TO WORK ON IT. BUT. THIS IS IN A BAND WE'RE NOT BANNING ANYTHING. YOU WANT TO SO YOU CAN HAVE A STRAW YOU JUST GOTTA ASK FOR IT ONLY FOR DINING RESTAURANTS IT'S A SMALL STEP. IS MEANT TO BE A MEASURED STEP THAT'S WHY THERE IS NO OPPOSITION AND QUITE FRANKLY AS THE RESTAURANTS ASSOCIATION HAS POINTED OUT. IT'S GOING TO HELP THEM SAVE MONEY. EVEN IF IT'S A LITTLE BIT AND STILL SAVE MONEY AND IT IS AN ADDED COST. AND I MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE AND IT'S GOING TO LEAD TO BETTER LONG TERM CHANGE AND HOPEFULLY BETTER DECISIONS AROUND THIS ISSUE SO I APPRECIATE THE TIME. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. WITH THAT CLARK LOW THE ROLL-ON MEMBERS VOTE. IS OUT OF THAT ALL MEMBERS VOTER DESIRE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTE DESIRE TO VOTE. CLERK WILL CLOSE ROLE AND TALBOT EYES FORTY FIVE. KNOWS SEVENTEEN THAT MEASURE PASSES. MEMBERS BACK IN FILE ORDER. THIS IS FILE ITEM NUMBER FIFTY. AB NINETEEN THIRTY NINE BY MR STEINORTH THE CORPORATE RATE. AT SOME LEVEL NINETEEN THIRTY NINE BY SOME A MEMBER STEINORTH AND OTHERS AND ACTUALLY THE CRIME VICTIMS MAKING A PREPARATION THEREFORE. MISTER STEINORTH THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AB NINETEEN THIRTY NINE WILL HELP SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE REMOVE THEMSELVES FROM ABUSIVE SITUATIONS WHILE MAINTAINING THE SAFETY OF THEIR PETS. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT OVER FORTY NINE PERCENT OF FEMALE FEMALE SURVIVORS THEM DOMESTIC VIOLENCE REPORTED THREATS OR HARM TO THEIR PATS. THIS FEAR OF ABUSE TO VICTIMS PAD IS BECAUSE UP TO FORTY EIGHT PERCENT OF SURVIVORS TO DELAY LEAVING AN ABUSIVE ENVIRONMENT. DUE TO THESE CONCERNS AB NINETEEN THIRTY NINE SIX TO REMEDY THIS OBSTACLE BY ALLOWING SURVIVORS TO HAVE THEIR PET BOARDED REIMBURSEMENT WHILE THE FLEEING ABUSIVE ENVIRONMENT. THIS BILL HAS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IS RECEIVE NO NO VOTES I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. DAVIS STEINORTH. MS MELENDEZ YOU'RE RIGHT NEXT. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I AM WHILE I CERTAINLY. AGREE. WITH THE AUTHOR STATED INTENT THAT THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT VICTIMS. DON'T HAVE TO ALSO WORRY ABOUT THEIR PETS. HERE IS THE ISSUE WITH THIS BILL. THIS VICTIMS COMPENSATION FUND HAS BEEN DWINDLING VERY QUICKLY OVER THE YEARS THAT IS DOWN NOW TO ONE OF ITS LOWEST POINTS. IN THE PAST. TEN TWENTY YEARS IT'S DOWN TO. TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IT'S HARDLY ANYTHING. THIS MONEY GOES FOR VICTIMS SO THAT THEY CAN GET TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. IN SOME CASES THEY CAN GET ALARM SYSTEM PUT IN THEIR HOMES BECAUSE THEY'RE FEARFUL OF THEIR SAFETY IN THE LIVES OF THEIR CHILDREN. IT ALLOWS THEM TO GO SEEK THE HELP THAT THEY'RE GOING TO NEED SOMETIMES VERY SEVERE CASES. SO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A FUND THAT HAS. MINIMAL RESOURCES RIGHT NOW IN IS WINDING DOWN VERY QUICKLY AND THERE'S NO AVENUE HERE TO REPLACE THAT FUNDING. FOR ME I CAN'T JUSTIFY VOTING THOUGH I LOVE. PETS AS WE ALL DUE AND I UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE I CAN'T VOTE TO. TO FIND THE BOARDING OF. ONE WOMAN'S PAT AND THE TELENOVELA WOMEN THAT THERE ISN'T ENOUGH FUNDING FOR HER TO GET THE SERVICES THAT SHE NEEDS. THAT JUST THAT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT TO ME SO ICE THAT I GET THE IDEA BUT NONE OF US SHOULD EVER TELL. I DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVOR OR WORD IS AN ASSAULT SURVIVOR WERE THERE ANY TYPE OF VICTIM THAT'S. SEEKING THESE FUNDS. THAT THEY'RE IN SECOND PLACE BECAUSE THEY'RE COMPETING FOR THAT BINDING. WITH SOMEONE ELSE'S PACKED SO AM. I WILL NOT BE VOTING FOR THIS BILL. MS GONZALEZ FLETCHER. THANK YOU I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND IT YOU KNOW WE WE MADE SOME CAREFUL DETERMINATIONS AS WE PASS THIS APPROPRIATIONS BECAUSE. I THINK MY COLLEAGUE FROM LIKE ALL SORTS RIGHT THE FUND IS DEPLETING AND IT'S VERY HARD TO TO PASS THESE BILLS AND SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE HAD BILLS THAT WERE HELD BECAUSE THIS FUND IS DEPLETING. BUT THE RESEARCHERS SO CLEAR THAT IN PARTICULAR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS. THEIR PETS ARE USED AGAINST THEM IN A WAY THAT AND. THAT THE REST OF US CAN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND IT IT'S A POWER STRUGGLE AND THERE IS EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THIS IS RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE WAY OF MAKING VICTIMS HOLE. AND SO WE THOUGHT IT WAS A WORTHWHILE BILL TO PASS OUT AND WE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS ONE ON ONE A VERY VERY NARROW ONES THAT WE WE SHOULD CONTINUE MOVING FORWARD I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE. THANK YOU MISS GONZALEZ FLETCHER SEEN NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. ON THE ITEM MISTER STEINORTH YOU MAY CLOSE YES I I DO AGREE THAT WE DO NEED TO COMPENSATE TO THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION FUND WE NEED TO I'M REINVEST INTO THAT FIND AND AND I COURSE AND CONCERNED ABOUT THE DWINDLING NUMBERS THAT ARE THERE AS WELL. BUT WHAT CONCERNS ME OR THE AMOUNT OF VICTIMS ACTUALLY STAY IN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS BECAUSE OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR PAT. AND IF THIS SMALL STAB WILL HELP FORTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE CHOSEN TO STAY IN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS GET OUT AND SEEK SAFETY AND CARE FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR THE PAT. I THINK THAT'S A GREAT INVESTMENT. THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY ASK DRIVE OUT. WITHOUT THE CLERK WILL OPEN THE ROLL-ON MEMBERS VOTE. DESIRE TO VOTE ALL MEMBERS VOTER DESIRE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTE.

MISTER TING. THANK YOU BUT SPEAKER AB TWENTY NINE FORTY TWO PROVIDES PROSECUTORS ANOTHER TOOL. IN THE TOOLBOX TO REDUCE CENTERS FOR DEFENDANT THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR REHABILITATION THE BILL ALLOWS PROSECUTORS THE DISCRETION TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RECALL IR RE SENSING OF DEFENDANTS. PROVIDED THAT THE DEFENDANT'S BEHAVIOR IS NOT A THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY AND THAT THERE'S EVIDENCE. ALL OF THEIR REHABILITATION.

AS LOW COST ENERGY EFFICIENT AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING AS WE'VE SEEN WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ACCESS RECALLING UNITS ARE GREAT WAYS FOR PEOPLE TO BUILD UNITS IN THEIR BACKYARDS IN THEIR GARAGES SO THAT RELATIVES FAMILY MEMBERS OR EVEN UP POTENTIAL TENANTS CAN USE THOSE UNITS FOR THE FUTURE.

I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT HEALTHCARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT. IT IS BECAUSE OF THIS BELIEF THAT I BECAME A DOCTOR. SO THAT I COULD CARE FOR THE RESIDENTS ALL OF THE RESIDENTS OF MY COMMUNITY. AS THE DOCTOR I SAW THE CHALLENGES THAT MANY CALIFORNIANS FACE TRYING TO GET GOOD MEDICAL CARE. I ALSO SAW MANY OF THE LIMITATIONS OF OUR CURRENT HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES. WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE WITHOUT INSURANCE ARE LESS LIKELY TO GET THE MEDICAL CARE THAT THEY NEED. THE FEDERAL INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE PUT IT SUCCINCTLY. UNINSURED PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVED TOO LITTLE CARE AND RECEIVE IT TOO LATE. AS A RESULT THEY OUR SECKER AND DIE SOONER. I'VE SEEN THIS FIRSTHAND. I WAS ON THE FRONT LINES OF HEALTH CARE AND FEEL THE URGENCY TO FIX OUR BROKEN CURRENT HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. AB TWENTY NINE SIXTY FIVE SEEKS TO EXPAND MEDICAL COVERAGE TO INCOME ELIGIBLE UNDOCUMENTED YOUNG ADULTS AGES NINETEEN THROUGH TWENTY FIVE. SIMPLY PUT. THIS BILL REMOVES A BARRIER TO HELP ACCESS DO TO IMMIGRATION STATUS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS UNJUSTLY IMPOSED. AB TWENTY NINE SIXTY FIVE WILL BRING CALIFORNIA ONE STEP CLOSER TO ENSURING THAT EVERY CALIFORNIAN HAS COMPREHENSIVE. AFFORDABLE ACCESSIBLE HEALTH COVERAGE. IN OUR RECENTLY CONCLUDED SELECT COMMITTEE ON HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. WITH CHAIRMAN WHAT AND I JUST FINISHED HEALTH CARE EXPERTS REITERATED SEVERAL TIMES THAT ARE SHORT TERM STEP TOWARDS UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. IS TO WORK WITH THEM CALIFORNIANS. CURRENT FRAGMENTED FINANCING SYSTEM AND IMPROVE COVERAGE TO EXPAND MEDICAL COVERAGE TO THE UNINSURED. NEARLY SIXTY PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS REMAINING UNINSURED POPULATION WHICH IS NEARLY THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS IS UNDOCUMENTED. ACCORDING TO THE UC REPORT RELEASED AT THE END OF OUR SELECT COMMITTEE. EXPANDING ELIGIBILITY TO MEDI CAL. TO THIS POPULATION WOULD LIKELY MAKE SUBSTANTIAL INROADS TOWARD UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. TWO YOU TO ARE UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS BEING UNABLE TO ACCESS HEALTH INSURANCE AND THE COMPOUNDING FEARS AND CHILLING AFFECTS. CREATED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE IS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED AN ADDITIONAL TRAUMAS ARE CREATING AN URGENCY TO ENSURE THEY ARE PROTECTED AND INSURED. INSTEAD OF BEING ABLE TO RECEIVE CARE IN A TIMELY MANNER. TO PREVENT ILLNESSES FROM DETERIORATING MANY UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS ONLY ACCESS HEALTH CARE IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM. WHERE MANY TIMES PHYSICIANS LIKE MYSELF OR NO LONGER ABLE TO HELP DUE TO THE EXACERBATION OF THEIR ILLNESS? I'VE SEEN COUNTLESS CASES IN MY EMERGENCY ROOM IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN OUR COUNTRY'S BREAD BASKET. WHERE FARMWORKERS WHO HELP? TO PRODUCE THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLES THAT FILL OUR TABLES. ARE UNABLE TO DO THE SAME FOR THEIR OWN FAMILIES DUE TO THEIR DIRE HEALTH CIRCUMSTANCES. NOT ONLY IS THIS CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS DETRIMENTAL TO THESE INDIVIDUALS. BUT IT ALSO INCREASES THE DEMAND ON EMERGENCY ROOM SERVICES AND INCREASES COSTS IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM OVERALL. IN A MANNER THAT COULD BE PREVENTED. WE CAN DO BETTER. THIS LEGISLATION BUILDS UPON THE WORK THAT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS DONE WITH HEALTH FOR ALL KIDS WHICH WAS CHAMPIONED BY SENATOR LOTT ON. WHO I AM PROUD TO BE WORKING WITH THIS YEAR TO EXPAND TO ALL LOW INCOME? UNDOCUMENTED YOUNG ADULTS. THIS BILL INSURERS THAT FULL SCOPE MEDICAL CONTINUES TO BE AVAILABLE TO LOW INCOME YOUNG ADULTS AS THEY AGE OUT OF ELIGIBILITY. DUE HEALTH FOR ALL KIDS WHEN THEY TURN NINETEEN. UNDOCUMENTED YOUNG ADULTS. CALIFORNIANS FACE BARRIERS. OF NOT HAVING HEALTH CARE WILL ALSO CARING FOR THEIR AGING PARENTS WHO HAVE WORKED HARD TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR CHILDREN.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS THIS BILL SEEKS TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS BY PROHIBITING THE SALE OF JUVENILE PRODUCTS MATTRESSES AND UPHOLSTERED. OR RE UPHOLSTERED FURNITURE THAT CONTAIN TOXIC FLAME RETARDANT CHEMICALS. EVERY DAY CALIFORNIANS ARE EXPOSED TO THESE CHEMICALS AND OVER TIME THE ACCUMULATED OUR BODIES AND IN THE ENVIRONMENT. CAUSING A VARIETY OF ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS INCLUDING ENDOCRINE AND THYROID DESTRUCTION CANCER AND HARMFUL NEUROLOGICAL IMPACTS. CHILDREN AND FIREFIGHTERS ARE OFTEN EXPOSED TO THESE CHEMICALS IN THEIR DERIVATIVES AT EVEN HIGHER RATES THAN THE GENERAL PUBLIC. INFANTS ARE OFTEN EXPOSED TO THESE CHEMICALS THROUGH CONTAMINATED DUST AND BREAST MILK. AND BEEN FOUND TO HAVE THESE CHEMICALS IN THEIR BODIES AT THREE DIFFERENT LEVELS THAT ARE THREE TO FIVE TIMES THE LEVELS IN THEIR MOMS. FIREFIGHTERS ARE EXPOSED TO FLAME RETARDANTS THROUGH THEIR WORK PROTECTING THE PUBLIC. AND WHEN FLAME RETARDANT CHEMICALS BURNED. THEY RELEASE CARCINOGENIC SUBSTANCES THAT ARE INHALED BY FIREFIGHTERS AND EVEN LINGER ON THEIR PROTECTIVE CLOTHING LONG AFTER THEY LEAVE THE SITE OF A FIRE. AS A RESULT WE'RE SEEING HIGHER RATES OF CANCER AMONG FIREFIGHTERS THAN EVER BEFORE. NOW HERE'S THE THING. IN ADDITION TO BEING TOXIC THESE CHEMICALS ARE COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY TO MEET FLAMMABILITY STANDARDS. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WE AS A STATE UPDATED R. FLAMMABILITY STANDARD AND THE PRODUCTS AFFECTED BY THIS BILL DO NOT NEED FOR NEED FLAME RETARDANTS. IN ORDER TO MEET THAT REVISED STANDARD.

AB NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE WILL EXPAND THE DISH DEFINITION OF GRAVE OF THE DISABLED TO INCLUDE MEDICAL TREATMENT WITH THE INABILITY OR FAILURE TO RECEIVE MEDICAL TREATMENT. WILL RESULT IN DETERIORATING PHYSICAL CONDITION OR DEATH. THIS IS A BILL THAT WE TOOK UP BECAUSE IT IMPACTS MY DISTRICT LIKE I'M SURE IMPACTS MANY OF YOURS. WHERE YOU HAVE A HOMELESS PERSON? AND YOU KNOW THAT THEY ABSOLUTELY NEED SOME MEDICAL ATTENTION AND THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN DO CURRENTLY UNDER THE LAW TO GIVE THAT PERSON. A MEDICAL ATTENTION. NOT CERTAINLY WERE WILL AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE ADVOCATES IN THE INTENTION IS NOT. TO JUST PICK UP PEOPLE THE INTENTION IS TO DO THE MORE HUMANE THING. AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY ALONE THAT WAS CLOSE TO EIGHT HUNDRED. AYE PEOPLE WHO DIED ON THE STREETS LAST YEAR. AND WHILE WE DON'T KNOW THE EXACT NUMBER OF THOSE WHO DIED. FOR MEDICAL NECESSITY IMMEDIATELY THAT COULD HAVE BEEN PART OF PREVENTED WE DO KNOW THAT THIS BILL WILL HELP US TO IDENTIFY FURTHER FOR DID ONLINE FOLKS WHO HAVE. MEDICAL NEED. AND FOR ONE REASON OTHER CAN'T RECEIVE IT. IT'S JUST A MORE HUMANE THING TO DO. PICK SOMEBODY AND GIVE THEM ALTHOUGH SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. CURRENTLY. YOU CAN SEE CONSERVATORSHIP. IF SOMEBODY. CANNOT HOPE. CLOTHE THEMSELVES FEED THEMSELVES OR HOW THE HOUSE THEMSELVES. BUT THE THRESHOLD IS SO HIGH. THAT WE BELIEVE THE MORE HUMANE THING TO DO WHEN SOMEBODY HAVE. NECESSITY. IS TO GIVE THEM THOSE SERVICES. AND THAT'S WHY WE DECIDED TO TAKE UP THIS BILL. SPECIALLY TAKE A LOOK SOME OF OUR DISTRICTS AND. SACRAMENTO CLOSED DE EIGHT NINE THOUSAND PEOPLE LIVE ON THE STREETS IN MY DISTRICT ALONE IN A FEW SQUARE BLOCKS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN EIGHT AND TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE AND MOST OF THEM HAVE. MISTER A MEDICAL NECESSITY. I AND. A WE TOOK THE THE APPROACH TO DO A BIPARTISAN BILL. I BECAUSE WE FELT THAT THAT WAS THE BEST WAY TO GET A BETTER PRODUCT OUT OF THIS. I THINK YOU MEMBERS. AND RESPECTFULLY ASK DR. THE US ON TIAGO DR CHEN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. I WRITE TODAY'S A PROUD WHEN AUTHOR OF AB NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE. MAKING A CHANGE THE DEFINITION OF GRAVELY DISABLED AS NECESSARY. BECAUSE THOSE WHO SUFFER FROM SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS ARE OFTEN A DANGER TO THEMSELVES. AND SOMETIMES TO OTHERS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE WHEN INDIVIDUALS AND CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING NATIVE IMPACTS. OTHER ILLNESS. UNDER EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAWS SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL INDIVIDUALS ARE FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS SOCIETY. INSTEAD OF RECEIVING SUPPORT TREATMENT AND ASSISTANCE THEY'RE BEING JAILED HOSPITALIZE HOPE FOR SHORT AMOUNTS OF TIME RELEASE BACK ONTO THE STREETS WITHOUT ADEQUATE CARE. THE FILM THE WHOLE SYSTEM CALIFORNIA COULD BE SEEN ALL OVER THE STATE. AND WOW THE MOST VULNERABLE TO LANGUAGE ON OUR STREETS WITHOUT A LIFETIME. IS INHUMANE AND WE CANNOT ACCEPT THIS IS A VIABLE OPTION. WHEN LOOKING CHANGE IN DEFINITION OF GRAVELY DISABLED WE NEED TO BALANCE INDIVIDUAL CIVIL LIBERTIES THE SAFETY OF PEOPLE. THOSE WITH MENTAL CONDITIONS RENDER THEM UNABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS REGARDING MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HEALTH. BY ADDING THE DEFINITION OF MEDICAL TREATMENT TO THE DEFINITION OF GRAVELY DISABLED IT WILL ALLOW THE STATE TO STOP A FAMILY GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT NEED OUR HELP. THEY NEED A RESOURCES AND OF COURSE NEITHER TREATMENT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU DOCTOR CHEN MISS FRIEDMAN HERE RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU. SPEAKER I RISE TODAY IS A JOINT AUTHOR OF NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE. AND I'M IS WHAT I TELL YOU A BRIEF STORY ABOUT. WHEN I REALIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS BILL. WHO A FEW OF US HAD THE JOINT AUTHORS TOOK A TOUR OF SKID ROW IN LOS ANGELES A FEW WEEKS AGO? I WAS SPEAKING TO THE WOMAN WHO OVER HER RUNS A FRONTLINE EMERGENCY SHELTER WHO DEALS WITH THE HOMELESS POPULATION EVERYDAY. AND WHAT YOU TOLD ME WAS. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO COME WHO WHO THEY SEE ON THE STREETS. BUT THEIR NOT REALLY ABLE TO PROTECT NOW THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO MEET THE DEFINITION RIGHT NOW A PEOPLE THAT. ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR CONSERVATORSHIP. BECAUSE THEY HAVE CLOTHING ON THEIR BACK EVEN IF IT'S ONLY A COUPLE PIECES OF NEWSPAPER AND THEY'RE ABLE TO FEED THEMSELVES EVEN IF IT'S FROM SCRAPS THEY FIND LYING ON THE SIDEWALK. AND THEY'RE NOT. STANDING IN FRONT OF TRAFFIC AND THEY'RE NOT WAVING A KNIFE SO THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR SEVENTY TWO HOUR HOLD. BUT BECAUSE OF CO MORBIDITIES DIABETES OTHER ISSUES. THEY KNOW THAT WITHOUT INTERVENTION. THOSE PEOPLE WILL BE DEAD IN A MATTER OF MONTHS THEY KNOW IT THEY SAID THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO WALK AROUND AND POINT PEOPLE OUT AND SAY THIS PEOPLE WILL BE DEAD VOTE WILL DIE. BECAUSE THEY DO NOT. NO WHERE THEY ARE THEY CERTAINLY. ARE NOT. MENTALLY. SUFFICIENT TO BE ABLE TO CHOOSE WHETHER OR NOT TO TREAT A MEDICAL. CONDITION THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO BECAUSE OF SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. CANNOT SURVIVE. EVEN. THEY CAN'T SURVIVE ON THE STREETS. BUT BECAUSE. OF THE WAY THE LAWS ARE WRITTEN THEY ALSO CAN BE PLACED A CONSERVATORSHIP THEY CANNOT BE COMPELLED TO TAKE MEDICATION THAT WOULD EXTEND THEIR LIVES. IT IS NOT HUMANE. TOO DAMN THESE PEOPLE TO DIE SLOWLY ON THE STREETS IN FRONT OF US THAT'S NOT HUMANE. IT'S NOT HUMANE TO SAY THAT UNTIL THEY COMMIT A CRIME AND WE CAN LOCK THEM UP THEY CAN'T GET HELP. AND YET BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE LAWS ARE WRITTEN THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS. WE. THE AUTHORS UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS THAT SOME OF THE OPPONENTS HAVE MADE AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING ON ADDRESSING THOSE AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. BUT DOING NOTHING IS NOT AN OPTION. SAYING THAT UNLESS SOMEONE IS AN IMMEDIATE DANGER THEY CANNOT. BE HELD A CONSERVATORSHIP IS NOT AN OPTION PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES THAT ARE THIS SEVERE ARE AS SEVERELY DISABLED TO SOMEBODY WITH A PHYSICAL HANDICAP AND GET THE LAW DOES NOT TREAT THEM THAT WAY. IF YOU TALK TO ANY OF THE FRONTLINE. EMPLOYEES AT THE SHELTER THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR THIS BILL TO BE ABLE TO GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS AND SAVE LIVES AND I URGE YOU. TO DOCTOR EGGMAN YOUR READINESS. I THINK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS OF I JUST RISE TO TO RAISE AN ISSUE AS MY COLLEAGUE ROSE ON. PREDATED ALSO TALK ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS FOR BABIES I JUST RAISE THE ISSUE THAT WE AYE I APPRECIATE EXPANDING CATEGORIES OF HOW WE. CAN INSTITUTIONALIZE PEOPLE BUT I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT WE DON'T DO ENOUGH FUNDING FOR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PSYCHIATRIC BEDS WHEN PEOPLE DO HAVE ACUTE. ISSUES AND SO WHAT WE CAN. FEEL GOOD ABOUT TAKING CARE OF EXPANDING HOW YOU CAN TAKE SOMEBODY'S RIGHTS AWAY I THINK MORE IMPORTANTLY WE NEED TO BUILD A PROACTIVE AND THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE PROVIDE MORE MENTAL HEALTH SO PEOPLE DON'T FIND THEMSELVES IN THIS CONDITION. MR ACOSTA. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I'LL BE BRIEF FILE I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB NINETEEN NINETY SEVENTY ONE WE HAVE AN ACUTE. MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS AND HOMELESSNESS ISSUE IN.

AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY FIVE WILL CREATE A NEW SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT CATEGORY IN THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA FOR THE LOWEST PERFORMING SUB GROUP OF STUDENTS NOT CURRENTLY RECEIVING A SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT. SOME OF YOU WHO ARE HERE THE FEW WHO WERE HERE FIVE YEARS AGO KNOW THAT THIS BILL TO THE CONCEPT OF LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA WAS IMPLEMENTED. PUT TWO THINGS ONE TO GET RID OF THE. CATEGORICAL IS AND THE OTHER PIECE WAS TO RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT SOME STUDENTS REQUIRE MORE RESOURCES IN ORDER TO BABY CLOTHES ACHIEVEMENT GAP. AT THE TIME IN OUR BEST WAS AND WE THOUGHT THAT THOSE STUDENT WITH FALL INTO CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF EITHER BEING LANGUAGE BILINGUAL. POVERTY OR FOSTER CARE HOMELESS KIDS AND AS A RESULT WE SUPPOSE WE CREATED A SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT PROGRAM FOR THOSE STUDENTS. AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY FIVE TACKLES A FLAW THAT WE FOUND THAT HAS BEEN DISCOVERED IN THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. SINCE IT WAS INSTITUTED TWENTY THIRTEEN. IN AN EFFORT TO TARGET RESOURCES TO THE HIGHEST NEED STUDENTS IN THE STATE. CURRENTLY THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS IN THE STATE. TWO ONE IN SIXTY ARE RECEIVING A SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT BECAUSE THEY ARE LOW INCOME ELL ARE HOMELESS A FOSTER YOUTH. HOWEVER THERE'S A SUB GROUP THAT'S A LITTLE. CLOSE TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS WOULD NOT RECEIVING A SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT I NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND FIND THEMSELVES IN THE LOWEST CATEGORY OF ACHIEVEMENT IN STATE. IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE AND CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP IT BECOMES NECESSARY THAT WE LOOK AT OUR SUBGROUP FUNDING. AND THAT WE CREATED ADDITIONAL CATEGORY. THIS IS THE ONLY GROUP OF STUDENTS PERFORMING BELOW THE STATE AVERAGE THAT ARE NOT ALREADY RECEIVING A SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT. IN ADDITION AFRICAN MEN STUDENTS HAVE THE LOWEST HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATE OF ANY STUDENT GROUP AT SEVENTY TWO POINT NINE PERCENT AND ALSO THE HIGHEST SUSPENSION RATE AT NINE POINT EIGHT PERCENT.

CURRENTLY AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS ARE THE LOWEST PERFORMING SUBGROUP DUE TO YEARS OF DETRIMENTAL POLICIES. EVEN THOUGH THE SUBGROUP INCLUDES PEOPLE'S AT ALL INCOME LEVELS IT SCORES ARE BELOW THE SCORES OF ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED PUPILS WHICH SUGGEST THAT POVERTY ALONE DOES NOT EXPLAIN. THIS OUTCOME. ABOUT NINETY TWO THOUSAND BLACK STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA ARE NEITHER LOW INCOME NOR ENGLISH LEARNERS AND THEREFORE DO NOT GENERATE SUPPLEMENTAL LC FFL LCF F. FUNDING. WE CONSTANTLY TALK ABOUT COLLECTING DATA AND USING DATA INFORM MATHIS. WE HAVE THE DATA THAT SHOWS WHEN ADJUSTING FOR INCOME AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE STILL THE LOWEST PERFORMING SUB GROUP. THAT DOES% NOT RECEIVE ADDITIONAL FUNDING THEIR LCF F.. WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENSURE THE GROUPS WE KNOW ARE FALLING BEHIND HAVE ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS. TO IMPROVE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE AND ULTIMATELY IMPROVE LIFE OUTCOMES. RATHER THAN INVESTING IN PRISONS CALIFORNIA SHOULD DEDICATE MORE FUNDS TO EDUCATION BY USING DATA WE ALREADY HAVE IDENTIFIED LOW PERFORMING STE SUBGROUPS AND DIRECT ADDITIONAL FUNDING. AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR ABOUT. AIMS HOLDEN MISS THEM ON. THANK YOU SPEAKER I RISE IN ALSO IN SUPPORTER. TO COLLEAGUES WHO ARE BRINGING THIS FORWARD AS SOMEONE WHO WAS A BOARD MEMBER WHEN THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FOR IT FORMULA ROLLED OUT. I UNDERSTOOD THAT THE IDEA WAS NOT JUST TO HELP ALL STUDENTS BUT PARTICULARLY ALL SUBGROUPS AND WE WERE ABLE TO DO THAT FOR ENGLISH LEARNERS FOSTER YOUTH. AND A LOW INCOME STUDENTS HOWEVER THERE IS STILL A GAP AND THIS BILL MEET ME AIMS TO ADDRESS THAT GAP OF ENSURING THAT OUR STUDENTS WHO ARE IN SCHOOLS WHO ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN. HAVE THE ABILITY TO ALSO BENEFIT THERE IS SUB GROUP THAT IS STRUGGLING TO PERFORM AND BECAUSE THE RESOURCES ARE NOT THERE SO I STAND IN SOLIDARITY AND I HOPE THAT WE WILL ALTHOUGH I FOR THIS BILL.

AT TO PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE EQUITY AND TO SUPPORT ALL STUDENTS ALL STUDENTS CAN BE SUCCESSFUL. UP BUT LCF AFTER SUPPOSED TO SUPPORT ALL STUDENTS WHO MAY HAVE BEAT DISADVANTAGE FOR WHATEVER REASON I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING.

AND WHEN WE FIND A GROUP THAT IS STRUGGLING ON THE BOTTOM AND WE CAN IDENTIFY THAT IS POOR OR WHATEVER THE AS WE'VE BEEN MUST TARGET RESOURCES.

RECENT ESTIMATES FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES SHOW THEIR APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE THOUSAND OPEN CHILD SUPPORT CASES WITH PASTOR BALANCES. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE TOTAL AMOUNT OWED AND PAST DUE CHILD SUPPORT WAS SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. OF THE SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION OWED LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA INTERCEPTED ONLY NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS THROUGH VARIOUS CHILD SUPPORT INTERCEPT PROGRAMS.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS AB THIRTY TWO OH SIX ALLOWS THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION TO ADOPT REGULATIONS TO ESTABLISH PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR NEW WATER METERS. IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE STATE WATER BOARD RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD TO ADOPT PROTOCOLS FOR THE REGULAR SAMPLING AND TESTING OF INSTALLED WATER METERS DURING THE BOARDS EXISTING REGULATORY PROCESS. FOR DEVELOPING WATER LOSS PERFORMANCE STANDARDS UNDER S. B. FIVE FIVE FIVE. ACCORDING TO WATER AUDITS FILED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. IT TURNS OUT THAT TWO THIRDS OF ALL WATER SYSTEMS CONDUCT NO REGULAR TESTING OR SAMPLING TO DETERMINE THE ACCURACY OF THEIR INSTALL METERS AND IF ANY OF YOU EVER SERVED IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT YOU KNOW THE COMPLAINTS FROM CITIZENS OVER. MAN ABOUT FUNCTION MALFUNCTIONING WATER METERS IS PRETTY COMMON. IN FACT JUST LAST MONTH THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO REPORTED MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND OVER CHARGES DUE TO THREE HUNDRED FORTY THREE MIS READ METERS. THE CITY HAS NOW PURCHASE A FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR DIGITAL TESTING BRANCH A TOAST CUSTOMER METERS AND ARE WAVING THE SIXTY SIX DOLLAR FEE TO HAVE METERS TESTED.

REQUIREMENTS RIGHT NOW FOR WATER METER EFFICIENCY UNITS HIGH TIDE THAT WE ADDED SOME I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. MISTER GALLAGHER. THANK YOU SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. WHAT WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON IS INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF WATER METERS? WHERE THEY'RE WHERE THEY'RE CURRENTLY ARE NINE? THIS WOULD INCREASE IN THIS ULTIMATELY IS GOING TO LEAD TO A NEW STANDARD THAT WOULD MAKE OBSOLETE. WATER METERS THAT ARE ALREADY THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN INSTALLED. THROUGHOUT URBAN COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. THEREBY INCREASING COSTS WHEN THEY HAVE TO REPLACE THOSE. ALREADY WORKING METERS WITH THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY STANDARD THIS GOING TO BE ESTABLISHED AGAIN BY AN UNELECTED. OF. THAT'S GONNA DETERMINE THAT FOR EVERYBODY AGAIN. WHEN THIS HAPPENS IN THE INCREASE HAPPENS IN YOUR WATER DISTRICT IN YOUR RATES ARE GOING UP BECAUSE WATER METERS HAVE TO BE REPLACED. THIS IS THE LEGISLATION. AND OTHER OTHER BILLS LIKE IT. HOW THEY'VE ALREADY PASSES HERE THAT IS GOING TO INCREASE THOSE COSTS? WERE ALL ACROSS UP AND DOWN THE STATE DOING MORE MORE. TO CONSERVE OUR WATER IN IN DIFFERENT AREAS THEY'RE DOING DIFFERENT THINGS BASED ON THEIR LOCAL NEEDS BASED ON THE FEASIBILITY. AND FINANCIAL ABILITY TO DO IT. THIS BILL DOESN'T TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT AND AGAIN TO GIVE THE POWER. TO AN UNELECTED BUREAUCRACY TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS FOR YOU AND FOR YOUR CONSUMERS IT'S GOING TO INCREASE COSTS. IN AN UNNECESSARY FASHION AND SO I'D ASK FOR OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. SEE NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. MS FREEMAN YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU THIS BILL IS ONLY AND I REPEAT ONLY A FAX FUTURE WATER METERS. AND REALLY WE SHOULD BE IN A POSITION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO SIMPLY REQUIRE. THAT MANUFACTURERS. PRODUCE EFFECTIVE WATER METERS I DON'T OVER OR UNDER BILL OUR CUSTOMERS I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY A VERY REASONABLE STANDARD. I DON'T SEE HOW THAT WOULD INCREASE COSTS BUT YOU KNOW IT DOES INCREASE COSTS FOR UTILITIES WHEN YOU FIND OUT THAT YOU HAVE UNDER BILL CUSTOMERS FOR YEARS BECAUSE OF A MALFUNCTIONING METER. OR WHEN YOU FIND OUT THAT. YOU MAY PEOPLE PAY WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN OVER BEING BEING OVER BILLED FOR YEARS AND NOBODY NOTICED BECAUSE NOBODY TESTED THOSE METERS AND THOSE METERS HAD NO BASIC STANDARDS. TO EVEN SHOW THAT THEY WERE EFFECTIVE. THIS WILL STOP THE OVERBILLING AND UNDER BILLING OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND JUST AS WE HAVE STANDARDS FOR MANY OTHER PRODUCTS THAT WE SAW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHEN IT'S SOMETHING AS FUNDAMENTAL AS WERE BILLING PEOPLE BASED ON THOSE PRODUCTS WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SET STANDARDS FOR EFFICIENCY.

THROUGH COVER CALIFORNIA WE HAVE TAX CREDITS IN PLACE TO HELP COVER THE COST OF PREMIUMS FOR THOSE MAKING LESS THAN FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LIMIT. OR F. P. L.. HOWEVER FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WHOSE INCOME EXCEEDS FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE FPL. THEY'RE COMPLETELY ON THEIR OWN KEEP IN MIND FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT OF FPL IS FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL. AB TWENTY FOUR FIFTY NINE CREATES A REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT FOR THOSE WITH INCOMES BETWEEN FOUR HUNDRED AND SIX HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE FPL. TO HELP COVER THE COST OF THEIR PREMIUMS. CREDIT IS EQUAL TO THE COST OF HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS FOR THE LOWEST COST BRONZE PLAN FOR THE INDIVIDUAL THAT EXCEEDS A PERCENTOF THEIR MODIFIED GROWS IN A GROSS INCOME. ESSENTIALLY THE BILL ENSURES THAT NO CALIFORNIANS SPENDS MORE THAN A PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME ON HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS. TOO MANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE FACING THE IMPOSSIBLE CHOICE A PAIN FOR HOUSING TRANSPORTATION GROCERIES CHILDCARE UTILITIES.

IN THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE. WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT THE TIME WHEN WE'D LOVE TO GET TO A POINT WHERE WE DON'T NEED A BLACK HISTORY MONTH OR IT WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH OR A LATINO HISTORY MONTH. WHERE WE FOCUS ONLY ON THAT TIME ON THE DESTRUCTIVE THE STUDY OF THOSE INDIVIDUAL GROUPS THAT WILL ONLY HAPPEN WHEN WE TAKE THE FIRST STEP IN THAT IS BY REQUIRING FIRST OF ALL? THAT ALL OF OUR CHILDREN LEARN ABOUT ETHNIC STUDIES AND THEN EMPOWERING ARE ALSO EDUCATORS WITHIN TO INCORPORATE THAT MATERIAL INTO THE REGULAR CURRICULUM SO THAT WE NO LONGER HAVE TO SPECIALIZE FOR SPERM CERTAIN MONTHS OF TIMES OUR PERIODS. THIS TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO MOVE FORWARD AS I SAID THIS IS A VERY DIVERSE STATE AND WE NEED TO HAVE A CURRICULUM THAT IS REFLECTIVE OF THE STATE IN THE PEOPLE IN WHICH WE LIVE.

HAVE A TENDENCY TO WEAKEN US MUCH MORE THAN STRENGTHEN US GIVING OUR STUDENTS OF KNOWLEDGE THEY NEED ABOUT OTHER FOLKS IN THE WORLD AND IN TERMS OF ETHNIC STUDIES. EMPOWERS THEM AGAINST THE NEGATIVE INFORMATION THAT THEY GET FROM THE MEDIA AND FROM OTHERS WHO HAVE VERY CLOSE MINES. CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO MOVE FORWARD WOULD VERY DIVERSE STATE AND WE NEED TO HAVE A CURRICULUM THAT REFLECTS THAT AND THIS IS THE FIRST STEP IN A BILL TO HELP HOPEFULLY MAKE IT. SO THAT ALL OF OUR MATERIAL IS ADEQUATELY INTEGRATED AND WOOD ON THE HISTORY AND CULTURE OF EVERYONE WHO LIVES IN CALIFORNIA I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT AYE VOTES AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY TWO. THEY DUCKED WEBER MISTER BONTA. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES AS CHAIR OF THE ASIA PACIFIC PACIFIC ISLANDER LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS AND PROUD TO AN AUTHOR OF THIS BILL I RISE IN SUPPORT. OF AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY TWO THE BENEFITS OF ETHNIC STUDIES CAN BE MEASURED. MULTIPLE STUDIES SHOW THAT WHEN STUDENTS OF COLOR LEARN MORE ABOUT RACE RACISM AND CULTURAL IDENTITY THEY RAISE THEIR GRADES AND THEIR GRADUATION RATES AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO ATTEND COLLEGE. AFTER GROWING UP IN YOUR FORMING YOUR VIEWS ABOUT THE WORLD IN ABOUT YOURSELF IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. SEE YOUR COMMUNITIES SUCCESSES AND HISTORY REPRESENTED IN A WAY THAT IS COMPLETE. THAT IS FAIR AND THAT IS ACCURATE THAT CREATES INSPIRATION. AND EMPOWERS THE NEXT GENERATION. IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME THAT MY OWN CHILDREN AND ALL HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE A MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITY. TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE HISTORY AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF ALL OF OUR DIVERSE GROUPS THAT CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO OUR STATE. TO OUR COUNTRY INTO OUR WORLD I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA FOR AUTHORING THIS IMPORTANT BILL TO ESTABLISH AN ETHNIC STUDIES CURRICULUM AT ALL CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOLS. I RESPECTFULLY URGE AYE VOTE. HE WAS BONTA DOCTOR CHOI YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THEN THROUGH. I RISE TO SUPPORT ALL OF OCT TWENTY SEVEN NINE SEVENTY TWO. ARE MANDATING A HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUM OUT TO INCLUDE ETHNIC STUDIES. I. AS MYSELF WESTERN IMMIGRANT. I FIND THE OUR COUNTRY AS A COUNTRY OF WHITE IMMIGRATION AND THEN ALSO PARTICULARLY. A CALIFORNIA OUT WE HAVE. A MORE AUTHORITY INTEGRATED A SERIES ON LOS ANGELES AND THEN EVEN MY CITY US CITY EVER IRVINE. SEVENTY FIVE DIFFERENT NOW ON. LANGUAGES ARE SPOKEN AND HOMES AND THAT WE ARE. ENCOURAGE OUR STUDENTS TO UNDERSTAND. A DIFFERENT CULTURES AND THE WITHOUT TEACHING. AT THE OF FOR VULNERABLE AGE SENSITIVE AGE. THIS IS ON NECESSARY EDUCATION FOR THEM TO DEVELOP. THE UNDERSTANDING OF DIFFERENT CULTURES AND THEN ALSO DEVELOP WITH SENSITIVITY TO DEFINE OUR CULTURES. AS STONE YOU URGE YOU I'VE WORKED. THEY GET CHOI SAY NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. I'M SORRY MISTER GALLAGHER. MEMBERS OF THE ONE WE RECOGNISE PLEASE RECOGNIZE YOU PLEASE RAISE YOUR MICROPHONES DURING DEBATE MISTER GALLAGHER. OUT THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. MY COLLEAGUE GUY FROM SAN BERNADINO SERVER SIDE COUNTY SORRY. WE'D WE SHARE A PASSION FOR HISTORY AND. AS SO AND NOT LIE I AM I AM SUPPORTIVE OF THE IDEA OF INCREASING THE AMOUNT. OF. OF OF HISTORY THAT IS TAUGHT IN OUR HIGH SCHOOLS THAT'S I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. WHAT I THINK WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO WORK ON WITH THE AUTHOR IS YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW I THINK DEFINING IT AS AS PURELY IN ETHNIC STUDIES? YOU IT'S A VERY DEFINED FIELD OF STUDY. AND I AND I THINK IT MAYBE EVEN BROADLY IN THAT YOU KNOW TO. WE DO DO CALIFORNIA HISTORY IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BUT I THINK. WE NEED TO TEACH OF A BROADER. SUBJECT OF CALIFORNIA HISTORY IN OF ALL THE. THE ETHNIC PEOPLES AND CULTURES. THAT HAVE INFLUENCE CALIFORNIA HISTORY. I'M ITS I'D LIKE TO SEE MAYBE THIS BROAD. SO THAT. THERE WOULD BE MORE FLEXIBILITY AMONGST THE DIFFERENT DISTRICTS TO TEACH. AND MAYBE EVEN MORE TO FOCUS IN ON THE LOCAL. HISTORY. OF DIFFERENT PARTS OF CALIFORNIA YEAH WE KNOW THAT EACH OF OUR LOCALITIES. WE HAVE AND. YOU KNOW DIFFERENT LOCAL HISTORY THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT. AND SO. I AGREE WITH THE SPIRIT OF THIS LEGISLATION. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT. MAY MORE BROADENED IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THAT WE CONTINUE. WHEN YOU HEAR OF OF STUDENTS GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL WITHOUT HAVING. NIELSEN VERY VITAL INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR HISTORY AND ABOUT HOW. OUR STATE OUR NATION AND OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES CAME TO BE. THAT'S DISCONCERTING AND AND SO I SHARE THAT MOTIVATION. THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS MOVIE. MORE BROADLY. BROADENED OUT YOU KNOW AS IT MOVES OVER TO THE SENATE. SURE THURMOND YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES ARE RISING SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY TWO. AS WE OFTEN SAY. I HISTORY IS OFTEN VIEWED THROUGH THE EYES OF THE BEHOLDER. AND IN THAT RESPECT HISTORY HAS OFTEN BEEN PROVIDED. IN WAYS THAT AS MY COLLEAGUE HAS SAID SHOULD BE BROADER. UP THIS BILL MOVES IN THE DIRECTION TO ACTUALLY CREATE THE KIND OF WRITING THAT I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE. TO HELP ALL STUDENTS SEE HOW. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THEIR ANCESTORS HAVE MADE CONTRIBUTIONS I TO THE STATE. ARM WHETHER THEY BE AFRICAN AMERICAN LATINO ASIAN OR FROM OTHER GROUPS NATIVE AMERICAN AND OTHERS. THAT WE SHOULD PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDENTS FROM THOSE GROUPS TO SEE THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS BUT ALLOW STUDENTS FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS TO ALSO SEE THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT HAVE. CONTRIBUTED TO OUR BROADER SOCIETY THIS IS A. BILL THAT'S MOVING IN A GREAT DIRECTION AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON BEHALF OF AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY TWO. MISS MELENDEZ. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND I DON'T DISAGREE THAT ETHNIC STUDIES CAN BE. A A HELPFUL COURSE FOR STUDENTS TO TAKE BUT LET'S NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT. A LARGE NUMBER OF OUR COLLEGE STUDENTS HAVE TO TAKE REMEDIAL MATH. IN REMEDIAL ENGLISH WE HAVE A VERY LARGE SEGMENT OF OUR BLACK POPULATION CRISPUS BIGGER BOYS. WHO BY A CERTAIN AGE IN THEIR EDUCATIONAL CAREER? CAN'T READ AND WRITE AT THE SAME LEVEL AS THEIR AS THEIR WHITE COUNTERPARTS. I THINK MORE OF A FOCUS ON THE ESSENTIALS THE BASICS. FOR STUDENTS IS WHERE THE FOCUS SHOULD BE OF WE'RE GOING TO INCREASE FUNDING FOR THAT. THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA TO ME BUT TO CONTINUE TO ADD THESE COURSES THAT ARE REQUIRED THAT ARE NOT GOING TO. THERE IS NOT GOING TO ADVANCE THEIR. ABILITY TO. TO GET A JOB OR TO GET INTO COLLEGE ORDER START THEIR OWN BUSINESS LATER THIS IT'S HELPFUL IT'S INTERESTING IT'S ENCOURAGINGIT'S GOOD FOR ONE. TO NO ONE'S BACKGROUND AND WENT HISTORY BUT THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER ESSENTIAL IS THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THAT I THINK EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM IF YOU READ THE REPORTS. WOULD AGREE THAT. WE ARE FAILING OUR STUDENTS. IN SO MANY WAYS SO IT'S NOT TO DISCOUNT. ON THE EFFORTS OF THIS BILL BUT I THINK. LET'S PLACE IMPORTANCE WHERE IT SHOULD BE. THANK YOU. MISTER SANTIAGO. I THINK YOUR SPEAKER KNOW WE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE. OF EDUCATION TODAY. BUT BUT WHAT ALL SAY ABOUT A PEOPLE'S HISTORY. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT. THAT A THAT A PEOPLE IS EMPOWER. NOW YOU MAY THINK THAT OR FOR THOSE OF THOUGHT THAT ETHNIC STUDIES ARE LESS IMPORTANT. THEN OTHER STUDIES. LOOK I TOOK TO CONDUCT STUDIES. AND I WAS VERY PROUD OF IT. AND IT TAUGHT ME ABOUT MY PEOPLE'S HISTORY AND THEY GAVE ME A PASSION FOR WHAT I WANTED TO DO IN LIFE. SO SOMETIMES I MIGHT ARGUE. THAT THE OTHER COURSE WORK IS IMPORTANT. AND IT IS. BUT I MIGHT ARGUE. THAT THESE KIND OF COURSES. ARE EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT OR MORE ON POINT. THE EMPOWERMENT OF OUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE WE'VE GOT THAT. DEVELOP THE SORT OF PEOPLE. WHO ARE GOING TO BE IN POSITIONS OF POWER? WHO WILL CARRY OUT POLICIES? BE IT IN THE CORPORATE WORLD. OR IF THE GOVERNMENT. OR LOCAL MUNICIPALITY. WHO HAVE THAT SCENE DRIVE AND ENERGY NOW? THERE ARE THOSE WHO HAVE MENTIONED WE SHOULD BROADEN THE BILL WE SHOULD DO THINGS OUR LOCAL. I. PIE WOULD DISAGREE SO CARRY OWN BILL. PASS IT TO THE LEGISLATURE. WHAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE ON THAT? AND AS WE AS A REFERENCE TO THE OTHER COURSES THAT ARE IMPORTANT. WE CARE THOSE BILLS TO. JOIN US IN IN HELPING TO FUND EDUCATION BETTER. JOIN US IN HELPING TO WHAT LIFT OUR COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THERE ARE REAL IMPORTANT. HISTORICAL LESSONS. AND AND AND ACTIONS THAT TOOK PLACE. AS TO WHY SOME COMMUNITIES ARE THE WAY THEY ARE TODAY. AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO STAND. THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT. DOES NOT HAVE POOR LATINOS BECAUSE THEY JUST ALL MOVED IT OUT AREA. WE DON'T HAVE LITTLE TOKYO BECAUSE IT'S JUST AS THERE WE DON'T HAVE CHINA TOWN ABOVE ME. ABOVE MY DISTRICT JUST BECAUSE SIMPLY PEOPLE WANTED TO MOVE THERE. THERE IS A HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE. AND MUCH OF IT WAS ABOUT A PRUSSIAN. IF YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE PEOPLE WHO WAS OPPRESSED. AND IF YOUR CULTURE WAS NOT OPPRESSED. GOD BLESS YOU. BUT MINE WAS AND IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR ME TO LEARN ABOUT IT. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT MOTIVATED ME TO BE HERE TODAY TOUGH FIGHT FOR THE BILL DOES VERY AND JUSTICES. AND WE CANNOT FORGET HIM. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT BUT HE'S KIND OF COURSE OR. COURSES AND UNLESS YOU UNDERSTAND. RICE THEN TODAY. I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW IT'S DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO ACCEPT OR EMBRACE. BUT THESE THAT THIS SORT OF CURRICULUM IS IMPORTANT IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. MISTER HARPER YOUR RECOMMENDS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. ARISES. VIA SPEAKER. THERE IS A HIERARCHY OF WHAT'S IMPORTANT WITH EDUCATION. THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL. AND IMPORTANT SUBJECTS. SUBJECTS WE ARE FALLING BEHIND IN. HEARING CALIFORNIA. AND NEED TO DEVELOP MORE FOCUS NOT LAST. MATHEMATICS. AND READING. RIDING. SPEAKING. AN ENGLISH. WHICH IS THE COMMON MEDIAN A CAR MEDIUM OF COMMERCE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY. IS THE COMMON MEDIUM. OF OUR DEMOCRACY. BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE. BEING ABLE UNDERSTAND MATHEMATICS. ARE ABSOLUTELY MORE CRITICAL. AND I'M SORRY. BUT WE NEED HAD MORE FOCUS ON. I AGREE WITH MORE FUNDING AND MORE PRIORITY. AND WILL REFORM IN EDUCATION. SO IT WEAKENED HAVE IMPROVEMENT IN RESULTS ON THE SUBJECT. FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. WE DO INDEED NEED MORE RESOURCES. BUT LET'S NOT LOSE OUR FOCUS. SOME SUBJECTS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN OTHERS. AND LET'S REALIZE THAT FOR THE SUCCESS OF OUR STUDENTS. FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE NEXT GENERATION. FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. MISTER EDUARDO GARCIA YOUR RECKONING THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I AM FEEL COMPELLED TO RISE AND SPEAK. SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY TWO. AS A PROUD. DEGREE HOLDER OF. BOTH A NATIVE AMERICAN STUDIES AND CHICANO STUDIES I CAN TELL YOU FIRSTHAND HOW EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND VALUABLE. THOSE PARTICULAR. STUDIES HAVE SERVED ME. VERY MY TIME IN PUBLIC SERVICE AND SO ONE OF THE COMMENTS WAS. THAT YOU KNOW WE SHIP BE PREPARING OUR STUDENTS FOR BETTER JOBS. AND JEAN THEM. ABOUT THE WORLD IN AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE WELL ROUNDED. AND THE DECISIONS BY THOSE WHO SIT ON. BOARDS AND OTHER TYPES OF CORPORATIONS THAT THEY TO UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR VARIOUS PERSPECTIVES TO BE BROUGHT TO THE TABLE. AS DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE AND REALLY AT THE CORE AND FUNDAMENTAL. REALLY TEACHING. TO ALL THAT IS BEING ABLE TO OFFER. ETHNIC STUDIES CLASSES TO YOUNG PEOPLE I CAN SHARE WITH YOU THAT. WHEN YOU TEACH YOUNG PEOPLE. ABOUT THEIR HISTORY ABOUT THEIR CULTURE. IT STRENGTHENS THEIR IDENTITY AND IT ALSO GIVES THEM A SENSE OF EMPOWERMENT. AND PURPOSE. IN THE PAST THAT THEY DECIDE TO TAKE IRRESPECTIVE OF WHAT TYPE OF JOB THEY MAY DECIDE TO TAKE. I CAN TELL YOU THAT IN MY COMMUNITY. YOU HAVE. THAT PROMISE YOUTH. THEN YOU PUT ON BEFORE. STRUCTURES TO LEARN ABOUT CHICANO STUDIES. AND IT CHANGES. THEY'RE THINKING. AND IT GIVES THEM A SENSE OF DIRECTION AND PRIDE THAT TAKES HIM TO SUCCEED AS OUR COLLEAGUE FROM OAKLAND MENTIONED THAT IT IS PROVEN FACT THAT WHEN YOU TEACH THESE CLASSES. IT IMPROVES THE QUALITY OF LEARNING AND EDUCATION THAT THESE YOUNG PEOPLE RECEIVE. AS A FORMER MAYOR OF THE CITY OF COACHELLA WE HAD FOUR. TRIBES WITHIN OUR JURISDICTION. MY UNDERSTANDING. AND KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A SOVEREIGN NATION. VIA THE TEACHINGS THAT I RECEIVED THAT UC RIVERSIDE ETHNIC STUDIES. HELP ME FACILITATE SOME VERY DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS BUT UNDERSTANDING. THAT IT WAS ABOUT MUTUAL RESPECT. AND THAT THE TRIBES HISTORICALLY. HAD BEEN LIKE TO. SHE DID TO AND IN MANY WAYS. HER. BY OUR OWN GOVERNMENT HERE IN CALIFORNIA HERE IN THIS COUNTRY AND SO WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING. THAT HISTORY PERHAPS I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE A SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES IN MY COMMUNITY SO I WANT JUST TO HIGHLIGHT THAT IN IN MY COMMENTS THAT. THESE TEACHINGS THESE CLASSES ARE OF EXTREME SIGNIFICANCE. A TEACHING EVERYONE. TO EMBRACE AND TO RESPECT THE DIFFERENCES THAT WE HAVE. AND I TRULY BELIEVE THAT AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY TWO. SETS THE TONE FOR EVERY HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE. TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR RIVAL. MISS KAMLAGER-DOVE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO SEVEN SEVEN TWO. I HAVE HEARD THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR GROUPS. WHO ARE GOING TO HIGH SCHOOL TO LEARN ABOUT THEIR OWN CULTURE? IT IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT FOR GROUPS TO LEARN ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE'S CULTURE. AND WHY IS THAT. BECAUSE WHEN YOU DON'T DO THAT. THEN YOU FAIL TO SEE. OTHER PEOPLE. AND WHEN YOU DON'T SEE ASKS. YOU ERASE SASS. AND I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK THAT THIS BODY. ISN'T THE HABITS. OF WANTING TO ERASE CULTURES AND DIVERSE CITY. I URGE YOUR SUPPORT ON AB TWO SEVEN SEVEN. THANKS YOU FOR THE ROBUST DISCUSSION MEMBERS SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEE RECOGNITION MR MEDINA YOU MAY CLOSE ON THE ITEM. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER.

WHEN I WENT TO COLLEGE I WAS GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN A LOT OF THINGS THAT I DID NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN ABOUT. THAT AS A A YOUNG PERSON. I LEARNED ABOUT THE WALKOUTS OF NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT THAT WE CELEBRATED HERE ON THIS FLOOR. AND THE IMPACT THAT THOSE WALK OUTS IN EAST LA HAD ON EDUCATION. AND HOW THAT THOSE WALKOUTS CHANGED EDUCATION. I LEARNED THAT IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT STUDENTS AT SAN FRANCISCO STATE. DEMONSTRATED FOR DAYS WEEKS EVEN MONTHS TO HAVE A CURRICULUM THAT REFLECTED ALL STUDENTS. AND A HAVE FACULTY THAT REFLECTED THEM AS WELL. I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY AS A TEACHER. TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES AND CHICANO STUDIES. AND A WEEK DOES NOT PASS WHEN I GO HOME TO RIVERSIDE THAT STUDENTS COME BACK. AND TELL ME THANK YOU MR MEDINA FOR THE CLASSES THAT YOU TAUGHT FOR WHAT YOU TAUGHT US. AND I CAN TELL YOU WHY. IF THERE IS A HIERARCHY IN EDUCATION. WHICH I DON'T DISAGREE THAT THERE IS. AT THE BEGINNING OF THAT HIERARCHY STUDENTS MUST SEE THEMSELVES. IN WHAT THEY ARE TAUGHT. IF THEY DO NOT SEE THEMSELVES AND WHAT THEY ARE TAUGHT THEY FEEL THAT EDUCATION. IS MEANINGLESS. SO AS WE STAND HERE AND DEBATE. PERFORMANCE PERFORMANCE OF ALL THE DIFFERENT GROUPS. AND EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS I WOULD ARGUE THAT. AT THE OUTSET. THAT CURRICULA MS INCLUDE THEM.

UPON ACCEPTING MY ROLE AS CHAIR OF THE BANKING COMMITTEE I'VE HEARD COMMON REFRAIN FROM FELLOW MEMBERS CONSUMER ADVOCATES REGULATORS LENDERS AND THE MEDIA THAT SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT SMALL DOLLAR CONSUMER LOANS IN CALIFORNIA. UNDER TITLE LOANS REQUIRE CONSUMER TO PLEDGE THEIR VEHICLE AS COLLATERAL ON THE LOAN POLICING AT RISK ONE OF THEIR MOST VALUABLE ASSETS AND OFTEN THEIR PRIMARY MODE OF TRANSPORTATION TO WORK TO SCHOOL AND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. UNFORTUNATELY TOO MANY CONSUMERS WHO TAKE OUT A TITLE LOAN HAVE THEIR CARS REPOSSESSED WHEN THEY ARE UNABLE TO MAKE SCHEDULED LOAN PAYMENTS. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN OVER TWENTY THOUSAND CARS REPOSSESSED COMPARED TO A HUNDRED AND EIGHT LOANS ORIGINATED. INDICATING THAT NEARLY ONE IN FIVE TITLE NAM BUYERS HAVE THEIR CAR REPOSSESSED. I AM A STRONG BELIEVER IN THE VALUE OF CREDIT MARKETS AND I DO NOT WANT TO ELIMINATE A BUSINESS THAT PROVIDE. AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE TO CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS I ALSO BELIEVE THAT HEALTHY CREDIT MARKETS ARE BUILT UPON THE FOUNDATION OF SOUND UNDERWRITING OF A BORROWS ABILITY TO PAY.

BUT REALITY THIS ISN'T THE CATHOLIC CHURCH BILL IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN TWO THOUSAND TWO WHEN IT WAS FIRST INTRODUCED. BUT SINCE THEN WE'VE LEARNED A LOT. IN IT SHOULD SCARE US HOW MUCH WE'VE LEARNED. THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT THE CHURCH THIS IS ABOUT HUNDREDS OF YOUNG ATHLETES ON OUR OLYMPIC TEAMS WHO ARE SUBJECTED TO SEXUAL ABUSE DESPITE EVIDENCE. THAT'S EXECUTIVE THE TOP OFFICIALS KNEW OF THE PREDATORY BEHAVIOR IT'S ABOUT STUDENTS AT OUR SCHOOLS WHO'VE BEEN SEXUALLY ABUSED BY TEACHERS AND COACHES IT.

SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE THE BECAUSE SOMEBODY IS IN THEIR MID TWENTIES STILL HAVE THAT READY TO PURSUE A STRESSFUL AND RETRY MATAI THE LEGAL RECOURSE THAT WE TELL THEM. THEY CAN ONLY PURSUE CIVIL REMEDIES IF THEY CAN PROVE THAT THEY HAD REPRESSED MEMORIES OR SOMEHOW DIDN'T KNOW THEIR ABUSE WAS AFFECTING THEM. THIS DOESN'T ONLY DENY A VICTIMS JUSTICE BUT GIVEN THE EVIDENCE OF HOW LONG IT CAN TAKE FOR VICTIMS OF CHILDHOOD SEXUAL THOUGHTS COME FORWARD.

THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTY ONE TWENTY ONE I THINK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO. FOR AUTHORING THIS BILL ONE OF MY CONSTITUENTS ROBERT MET WITH ME EARLIER THIS YEAR AND HE SHARED HIS PERSONAL STORY. TO CLEAR DO CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED THE INJUSTICE AND THE DANGER CREATED BY THE TWO THOUSAND NINE PROSPECTIVE ONLY AMENDMENT TO THE GOVERNMENT CODE. HE OUT ROBERT JOIN THE LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT EXPLORER PROGRAM IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO WHEN HE WAS A HIGH SCHOOL FRESHMAN. AND THERE HE WAS ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN RIGHT ALONG WITH WITH SOME POLICE OFFICERS THE RIDE ALONGS OFTEN MADE A STOP AT THE NOT LOCAL NINE ONE ONE CENTER AND DURING ONE OF THOSE STOP HE WAS INTRODUCED TO A LOCAL GROUP LEADER IN AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICE. SPECIALIST PROCESS THE NINE ELEVEN CALLS FOR THE DEPARTMENT. THIS SPECIALIST WAS ABLE TO BEFRIEND ROBERT AND TO GROOMING FOR SEXUAL ABUSE WHICH IN HE ENTERED FOR YEARS. DURING THIS TIME HE CONFIDED TO A MEMBER OF THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT THE ABUSE BUT IT WASN'T TAKEN SERIOUSLY. BECAUSE OF THE ABUSE ENDED BEFORE JANUARY FIRST OF TWO THOUSAND NINE ROBERT WAS FACED WITH A SIX MONTH CLAIM PERIOD IN WHICH IT WAS OBLIGATED TO NOTIFY THE AUTHORITIES OF THE ABUSE ARE HIS CLAIM WOULD FOR EVER BE LOST. THIS IS AN UNREASONABLE BURDEN TO PLACE ON ANY CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ABUSE SURVIVORS THIS ARBITRARY TIME LIMIT NOW PREVENTS HIM FROM SEEKING JUDGE JUSTICE. AND I ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT A. B. THIRTY ONE TWENTY IN HIS NAME. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE ALSO IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTY ONE TWENTY.

MADAM CLERK PLEASE CLOSE THE RULE AND TALLY THE VOTES. AYE AYES FORTY ONE IT KNOWS THREE THAT MEASURE PASSES. MOVING TO ITEM ONE FIFTY A. B. THIRTY ONE TWENTY NINE MADAM CLERK PLEASE READ ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY ONE TWENTY NINE BY SOME THE MEMBER RUBIO AND ACTUALLY TO FIREARMS SOME MEMBER RUBIO YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER TODAY I'D LIKE TO PRESENT A. B. THIRTY ONE TWENTY NINE A BILL TO ENHANCE PUBLIC SAFETY BY KEEPING GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF THOSE ALREADY PROHIBITED FROM HAVING THEM. IN LIGHT OF THE MOST RECENT MASS SHOOTINGS THE NATIONAL SPOTLIGHT HAS FOCUSED ON GUNS GUN LAWS. AND THEIR IMPACT ON SOCIETY A. B. THIRTY ONE TWENTY NINE ALIGNS WITH FEDERAL LAW BY IMPOSING A LIFETIME BAN ON THE POSSESSION OF A FIREARM FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF A MISDEMEANOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OFFENSE. THIS IS ONE OF THE RARE INSTANCES WHERE CALIFORNIA'S GUN LAWS GUN LAW IS MORE LENIENT THAN FEDERAL LAW. MEMBERS WE'RE NOT CREATING A NEW CLASS OF PROHIBITED PERSONS NOT OWNING A FIREARM. BUT MERELY HELPING KEEP GUNS OUT OF THE ANDS OF THOSE ALREADY PROHIBITED FROM HAVING THEM. CURRENT STATE LAW IS AN ADEQUATE TO FULLY PROTECT SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. ACCORDING TO THE ALLEY COUNTY DA'S OFFICE. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. EIGHTY FOUR POINT NINE PERCENT OF THE FELONY FIREARM CASES. THAT THE FAMILY VIOLENCE DIVISION FILED THE DEFENDANT HAD A PRIOR MISDEMEANOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CONVICTION. LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN EIGHTY FOUR POINT NINE PERCENT IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. OF THE FELONY FIREARM CASES THAT THE FAMILY VIOLENCE THE VISION FILE THAT THE DEFENDANT HAD A PRIOR MISDEMEANOR. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CONVICTION. ABUSED WOMEN ARE FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE KILLED IF THEIR ABUSER OWNS A FIREARM. AND THE METHOD VIOLENCE ASSAULT INVOLVING A GUN ARE TWELVE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO END IN DEATH. THEN ASSAULTS WITH OTHER WEAPONS OR PHYSICAL HARM. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL COALITION AGAINST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS ONE OF THE MOST CHRONICALLY UNDER REPORTED CRIMES. ONLY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF ALL PHYSICAL ASSAULTS PERPETRATED AGAINST FEMALES BY THEIR PARTNERS ARE REPORTED TO THE POLICE. ONLY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT REPORTED. LET ALONE ARRESTS PROSECUTIONS AND CONVICTIONS THIS MEANS THAT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT GO UNDER ON REPORTED. THERE IS A VERY REAL CONNECTION BETWEEN PAST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND A PROPENSITY TO FUTURE VIOLENCE INCLUDING MASS SHOOTINGS. TRAGICALLY CHILDREN ARE THE MOST COMMON VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC MASS SHOOTINGS. WHILE THERE ARE NO GOVERNMENT STATISTICS ON HOW MANY CHILDREN ARE KILLED IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SITUATIONS. THE HUB HUFFINGTONPOST FOUND THAT CHILDREN UNDER SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD YEARS OLD MADE UP THE LARGEST GROUP OF VICTIMS IN THE STUDY. AND WHILE WE SIT HERE AND DISCUSS THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE MISDEMEANOR OFFENSE NEARLY THREE US WOMEN EVERY DAY ARE KILLED BY AN INTIMATE PARTNER AND NEARLY FIFTY PERCENT. OF THOSE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CRIMES GO UNREPORTED. THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF JUSTICE STATISTICS SAYS AN AVERAGE OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN THOUSAND INSTANCES OF NONFATAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. WERE REPORTED TO POLICE ANNUALLY OVER THE PAST DECADE AND FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND INSTANCES WHERE I'M REPORTED. FOR THE MEMBERS WHO QUESTIONS WHY SINGLE OUT THE MESS THAT VIOLENCE. WELL I HOPE I WAS ABLE TO SHED LIGHT ON NOT ONLY THE DATA. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF LIVES THAT HAVE BEEN LOST OR AFFECTED BY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ABUSE INVOLVING A FIREARM. THANK YOU AND EVERY RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU A SOME MEMBER COMPOUND. OF YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I. JUST RISE TO URGE THOUGHTFULNESS IN. YOUR VOTE ON THIS BILL. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THERE IS A NON NEGOTIABLE IN FACT I'M A VICTIM A SURVIVOR OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND I KNOW WHAT. THAT CAN FEEL LIKE AND LOOK LIKE. BUT POSSESSION. THERE IS A VERY LOW THRESHOLD FOR POSSESSION IN OUR PENAL CODE. AND I JUST WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU TWO EXAMPLES. YOU COULD BE IN A CAR WITH A FRIEND. AND NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT IS IN THAT CAR. AND YOU COULD GET STOPPED. AND IF THE POLICE FIND. A FIREARM IN THAT CAR. POSSESSION IS CONNECTED TO YOU. YOU COULD BE WITH A FRIEND. GOING TO A. FIRING RANGE YOUR FRIEND COULD NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY. TO PURCHASE BULLETS COULD NOT HAVE THE RIGHT ID. AND YOU COULD PURCHASE THEM FOR THE FRIEND AND NEVER GOING TO THE RANGE AND SHOOT. BUT YOU HAVE A RECEIPT AND IF YOU GET STOPPED. YOU ARE IN POSSESSION. SO I URGE SOME THOUGHTFULNESS IN YOUR VOTE ON THIS BILL AND IF IT DOES PASS I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL WILL TAKE THESE ISSUES INTO CONSIDERATION AS IT MOVES FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAKER YOUR RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MA'AM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I BRIEFLY STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS MEASURE AND VERY PLEASED THAT OUR COLLEAGUES BRINGING IT FORWARD. THE AND RESPECTFULLY THE SCENARIOS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT FORTH TO YOU IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL. ILLEGAL UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW FOR A PROSECUTOR TO PROSECUTE SOMEBODY FOR DOING THAT. AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE IN THEORY THAT MAY SOUND LIKE A PROBLEM IN FACT. SCRUPULOUS PROSECUTORS WILL NOT DO WHAT YOU JUST HEARD. AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THIS BILL IS VERY VERY MUCH UNNECESSARY BILL. AND I URGE YOUR SUPPORT IN FAVOR OF GOOD POLICY AND NOT A NO VOTE BASED ON. A HYPOTHETICAL THAT IS ILLEGAL UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW THINK YOU. THANK YOU SEEING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE IS ALL I'M I BEG YOUR PARDON DOCTOR QUIRK YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. YEAH ARM IT'S ALREADY THERE'S ALREADY A TEN YEAR PROHIBITION. FOR OWNING A GUN IF IT'S A MISDEMEANOR. OUR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. VIOLATION. I THINK THAT'S A GOOD LONG TIME. ALL I COULD BE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IF SOMEONE WHO HAD HAVE A LONG RECORD IN IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE FROM TEN YEARS TO TWENTY. I COULD DO THAT ALONG CLEAR RECORD WOULD THEN BE EXONERATED AND ABLE TO EXERCISE ALL THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS. I JUST THINK THAT A LIFETIME BAN IS TOO MUCH THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BELINDA'S YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. WE'VE WE'VE HANDED DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS THE AUTHOR AND I AND AND I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AND I THINK YOUR INTENTIONS ARE CHEN ARE GENUINE. BUT THERE ARE FEW ISSUES SOME SUMMER HE BROUGHT UP BY SOME OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS BUT I SPOKE WITH MY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THIS MORNING ABOUT THIS BILL. IN THEY SAID DIET. YOU KNOW YOU COULD HAVE A SITUATION WHERE. THERE IS A CONVICTION FOR MISDEMEANOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN A SITUATION WHERE A HUSBAND AND WIFE ARE BOYFRIEND AND GUARDINO WHATEVER. ONE THINKS THE OTHER IS CHEATING ON THEM. THEY GET INTO A FIGHT. SHE HITS HIM THROW SOMETHING OUT M. WHATEVER IT GOES TO COURT SHE CAN BE. AN AND THERE ARE MANY TIMES ARE THAT HAPPENS WHERE HE OR SHE IS CONVICTED OF MISDEMEANOR. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. SO DOES THAT PERSON DESERVED TO HAVE A LIFETIME BAN. FOR OWNING A FIREARM BECAUSE OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT FALL INTO THIS AREA THAT I THINK. MOST OF US WOULD AGREE PROBABLY SHOULDN'T RESULT IN A LIFETIME BAN THERE ARE SOME CERTAINLY THAT DO BUT WE ARE LUMPING EVERYONE INTO THE SAME CATEGORY WHICH I THINK IS AN UNFAIR WAY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE THERE'S PROBABLY SOME WAYS. THIS COULD BILL COULD BE TIGHTENED UP A LITTLE BIT BUT I ALSO WOULD CAUTION YOU. IN MAKING SUCH A SWEEPING CHANGE LIKE THIS BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO BE. ENTRAPPING A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS LAW THAT DESERVE NOT TO BE IN THEIR THINK YOU. THANK YOU I SEE NO FURTHER REQUEST TO SPEAK ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I JUST POINT TO SAY THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS NO RACE. ETHNICITY CLASS OR GENDER IT IMPACTS EVERY COMMUNITY HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND I STAND HERE TODAY WITH SURVIVORS. UP OF DOMESTIC FROM DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. WITH EVERY COMMUNITY AND I ASK YOUR SUPPORT. OF THIS IS ALSO CODIFYING THE FEDERAL LAW THAT ALREADY IMPOSES A LIFETIME BANS IT IS NOT IN LINE WITH FEDERAL LAW WHICH. IS SURPRISING TO ME BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S USUALLY THE WILL OF THE BUT LEADING. STATE IN ISSUES LIKE THIS SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU BENEFIT PLEASE OPEN THE ROLE. MEMBERS VOTE WHO DESIRE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTE WHO DESIRE TO VOTE.

A NUMBER OF THEM WERE SHOT AND CLASSROOMS THAT COULD ONLY BE LOCKED FROM THE OUTSIDE.

FEW INDUSTRIES ARE MORE INDELIBLY TIED TO A LOCATION IN THE UNIT ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY IS THE CALIFORNIA. THIS INDUSTRY CREATES HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF GOOD PAYING MIDDLE CLASS JOBS AND BILLIONS AND ECONOMIC IT ACTIVITY THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA EACH YEAR. CALIFORNIA'S REPUTATION AS THE HOME OF FILM AND TELL TV DRIVE MUCH OF THE TOURISM OUR STATE SEES AS WELL. UNFORTUNATELY SINCE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES OTHER STATES AND COUNTRIES OF LORD PRODUCTION OUT OF CALIFORNIA A GENEROUS TAX BREAKS. IN AN EFFORT TO COMBAT PRODUCTION FLIGHT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED THE CALIFORNIA FILM AND TELEVISION TAX CREDIT PROGRAM TWO THOUSAND NINE. WE'VE IMPROVED UPON THAT PROGRAM OVER THE YEARS WITH EACH EXTENSION OF THE INCENTIVE THE CURRENT PROGRAM SOME SENSE INTO YEARS ON JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY. DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THE MOTION PICTURE AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION DECISIONS REGARDING SHOOT LOCATIONS ARM OFF MADE OFTEN A YEAR OR MORE IN ADVANCE. MOTION PICTURE TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS NEED THE CERTAINTY OF THE CALIFORNIA FILM AND TELEVISION. TAX CREDIT PROGRAM IN ORDER TO CONSIDER CALIFORNIA'S LOCATION IN THEIR PRODUCTION PLANNING.

AND TO BRING BACK JOBS TO CALIFORNIA THUS ENSURING THAT THIS VIBRANT FOUND DASCHLE INDUSTRY REMAINS A PART OF CALIFORNIA'S LEGACY. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL AND THINK THE MANY JOINT AUTHORS ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU A SOME MEMBER ASSEMBLY MEMBER ACOSTA YOUR RECOGNIZE. WELL THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY FOUR THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL I IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR MY DISTRICT HOW WE CALL OURSELVES HOLLYWOOD NORTH. HOW WE HAVE MANY MOVIE RANCHES AND PRODUCTION STUDIOS? AND WHAT'S ALSO IMPORTANT IS THE FACT THAT WE CAN HELP KEEP CALIFORNIA VERY COMPETITIVE. I LIKE TO SEE THIS EXPANDED OTHER INDUSTRIES BUT THIS INDUSTRY. IN PARTICULAR HOUSE ITS ROOTS IN CALIFORNIA AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IS THAT IT CREATES A LOT OF JOBS AND A LOT OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. IN THE REGION AND I HIGHLY SUPPORT AB ONE SEVEN THREE FOUR THANK YOU. THANK U. S. SOMEWHERE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THE MINISTRY CAN MEMBERS. YOU KNOW I I AM SUPPORTIVE OF A TAX CREDIT THAT HELP SUPPORT BUSINESS. AYE BUT AT THIS TIME I DON'T THINK I CAN BE SUPPORTIVE OF FOCUSING ON ONE INDUSTRY IN THIS STATE. WHEN AT THE SAME TIME WE PASS LAWS AND LEGISLATION TO MAKE IT VERY HARD TO DO. BUSINESS IN OTHER SECTORS INCLUDING A MANUFACTURING. IN AGRICULTURE. AND MANY OTHER SECTORS OF THIS ECONOMY THAT ARE STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW THEY DON'T GET. A TAX CREDIT BENEFIT. AND ALSO AT A TIME WHEN. WE FAIL TO PASS TAX CREDITS THAT WOULD HELP PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES GET HIRED. I HAD A MEASURE MYSELF THAT WOULD HAVE DONE THAT. IT WAS KILLED. NOT SO I WAS AT THE TIME WERE HURTING OTHER INDUSTRIES. I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD. YOU KNOW. TARGET ONE SPECIFIC INDUSTRY IN THIS STATE. AND GIVE THEM THE BENEFIT OF A TAX CREDIT WE'RE NOT DOING THE SAME FOR A WHOLE LOT OTHER INDUSTRIES IN THE STATE I DON'T THINK WE CAN IN GOOD CONSCIENCE DO THAT. AND ESPECIALLY WE WON'T EXTEND THE SAME COURTESY. TO THE DISABILITY THEN THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED. COMMUNITY. WHO ALSO IS IN NEED OF OF OF HELP AND SUPPORT? IN THIS STATE SO FOR THOSE REASONS I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS TODAY. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES OF THE JOINT AUTHORS ON THIS BILL THE CHAIR OF THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER. LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY FOUR. I DON'T THINK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP IN HIS PARTNERSHIP LEAD AUTHOR. OUR MAJORITY LEADER CALIFORNIA'S INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED FOR OUR FILM AND ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY AND THIS MEASURE WILL HELP TO PRESERVE THAT REPUTATION AND MORE IMPORTANTLY IT'LL PROTECT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA JOBS. BUT AS WE VOTE TO EXTEND THE FILM TAX CREDIT PROGRAM IT'S CRITICAL THAT FILMS TELEVISION SHOWS AND OUR WORKFORCE. BOTH ON AND OFF THE SCREEN REFLECTED ADVERSITY OF OUR STATE IT'S REALLY INTERESTING THIS TIME BECAUSE WE WERE JUST MEETING WITH. OUT MAGGIE Q. API ACTRESS THE FIRST ASIAN AMERICAN LEAD IN A BROADCAST DRAMA. WHICH JUST OCCURRED IN TWENTY TEN ARE TRAGICALLY WAIT WAIT TO RECENTLY AND SHE SHARED HER OWN PASSION ABOUT THE NEED TO INCREASE DIVERSITY. IN FILM WHEN IT COMES TO THE ONSCREEN REPRESENTATION OF ASIAN AMERICANS IT'S COMMON TO SEE WHITE ACTORS AND ACTRESSES TAKE THE PLACE OF TRADITIONAL. ASIAN ROLES HOLLYWOOD IS DOING BETTER BUT IT IS STILL FALLING SHORT. THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES OF THIS I IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA WITH THEIR ACTORS AND ACTRESSES AND I KNOW MY COLLEAGUES ON THE MEMBER AYE CHU WELL. SAY MORE ABOUT THAT BEHIND THE SCENES IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE DIVERSE WRITERS PRODUCERS AND DIRECTORS SO THEY CAN SHARE THEIR STORY AND THE STORIES OF ASIAN AMERICANS IN A WAY THAT ONLY THEY COULD. IN SHORT DIVERSITY MATTERS. THE FILM INDUSTRY SHOULD RESPECT AND REFLECT THE DIVERSE CITY OF OUR STATE. THE API CAUCUS IS ENCOURAGED BY THE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR LEAD AUTHOR AND APPRECIATE HIS WILLINGNESS TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS WE EXPECT THOSE CONCERNS TO BE ADDRESSED AND KNOW THAT THEY WELL AS AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY FOUR. MOVES FORWARD WERE PLEASED THAT THIS YEAR ABOVE THE LINE DIVERSITY PROVISIONS WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE CALIFORNIA FILM TAX CREDIT LAW. FOR THE FIRST TIME I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY FOUR. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVID CHIU YOUR RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. COLLEAGUES TO ME FIRST START BY EXPRESSING MY HISTORIC SUPPORT FOR THIS FILM TAX CREDIT. UP BEFORE HE CAME TO THE ASSEMBLY I FIRST MET THE MAJORITY LEADER A NUMBER OF YOU. ARE SUPPORTING THE ORIGINAL FILM TAX CREDIT IN PART BECAUSE MY DISTRICT HAS SOME OF THE MOST A FILM BUSINESS AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA OR USED TO. AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THIS CONTINUE. THAT BEING SAID LET ME EXPRESS SOME OF MY INITIAL AMBIVALENCE AROUND THIS TAX CREDIT. BECAUSE AS MY COLLEAGUE THE CHAIR OF THE API CAUCUS JUST MENTION. THE FACT IS HOLLYWOOD DOES NOT REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF OUR STATE. OR A COUNTRY. OR THE WORLD. THIS FILM TAX CREDIT NEEDS TO HELP TO MOVE THAT NEEDLE. AS CALIFORNIA IS MAJORITY MINORITY STATE AS UNITED STATES IS BECOMING A MINORITY MAJORITY COUNTRY. HOLLYWOOD HAS BEEN WOEFULLY BEHIND. WHEN IT COMES TO. THE INVOLVEMENT OF AFRICAN AMERICANS LATINOS. LGBT WOMAN AND OTHERS BOTH BELOW THE LINE AN ABOVE THE LINE WHEN IT COMES TO ACTORS WRITERS DIRECTORS AND PRODUCERS. HOW TO TAKE A MOMENT AND SPEAK ABOUT HOW I'VE EXPERIENCES AS AN ASIAN AMERICAN? GROWING UP. MY ASIAN AMERICAN ROLE MODEL WAS LONG DUCK DONG IN SIXTEEN CANDLES. CHILDREN TODAY WATCH THE DEPICTION OF HANS IN TWO BROKE GIRLS. SOUTH ASIANS WATCH THE DEPICTION OF OP WHO IN THE SIMPSON'S. WHEN I TALK TO MY ASIAN AMERICAN ACTORS AND ACTRESSES FRIENDS THEY TALK ABOUT THE FACT. THAT THEY OFTEN ONLY GET TO. INTERVIEW FOR ROLES INVOLVING THE FIVE JEEZ. THEY GET TO INTERVIEW FOR PARTS INVOLVING KOOKS GEEKS GANGSTERS GEISHAS AND KUNG FU MASTERS. WHY IS IT THAT TWENTY YEARS AFTER MARGARET SHOW IN ALL AMERICAN GIRL? ARE WE STILL WAITING FOR API'S TO BE CAST AS LEADS IN A SITCOM OR TWENTY FIVE YEARS AFTER JOY LUCK CLUB ARE WE WAITING FOR ASIAN AMERICANS. TO BE CASTING LEADS IN A MOVIE. THE NIGHT MY SON WAS BORN. ON THE OSCARS. THEY'VE. SOME MEMORABLE AND AS FOR WHAT REASON DO ARISE. POINT OF ORDER MADAM SPEAKER WHILE I APPRECIATE WHAT THE SPEAKER HAS TO SAY DON'T THINK THAT IS SPEAKING TO THE MERITS OF THE BILL. MISTER CHIU CAN YOU PLEASE TRY AND ACCESS TO THE BILL THE NEXUS IS WHY I AS AN ASIAN AMERICAN WOULD HOPE THAT THIS FILM TAX CREDIT DOES MORE TO MOVE. THE DIVERSITY OF THE HOLLYWOOD INDUSTRY. WITH THAT ELECT TO CONTINUE. WITHOUT OBJECTION THE NIGHT MY SON WAS BORN ON THE OSCAR STAGE THERE WERE THREE YOUNG ASIAN CHILDREN WHO WERE BROUGHT ON THAT STAGE. AND THEY WERE STEREOTYPED IN FRONT OF AN INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCE. LAST YEAR IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ON HWY FIVE THOUGH THE ASIAN LEADS QUIT BECAUSE THEY WERE PAID UNEQUAL SALARIES TO THEIR WHITE COLLEAGUES. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. IT WAS A YEAR OF WHITEWASHING WHEN YOU HAD ACTOR AND ACTRESSES THAT DEPICTED ASIAN ROLES WERE NOT ASIAN. THIS IS BROADER THAN THE EXPERIENCE OF API'S IN HOLLYWOOD. IT'S ABOUT OSKAR SO WHITE. IT'S ABOUT HOLLYWOOD SO WHITE IT'S ABOUT THE ME TOO MOVEMENT AND HARVEY WEINSTEIN. THIS IS THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG. ANOTHER MEMORABLE AND AS FOR WHAT REASON DO YOU RIDE MADAM SPEAKER POINT OF ORDER THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE TIME CREDIT BILL THAT IS BEFORE US. WE NEED TO MOVEMENT. WELL WHO IS BEING CAST IN LEAD ROLES AND WHAT ETHNIC BACKGROUND THEY COME FROM HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE TAX CREDIT BILL THAT IS BEFORE US WHICH IS NOT FOR. LEAD ROLES AS IT WAS EXPLAINED TO ME BY THE SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL DOES FOR BELOW THE LINE ACTORS NOT LEAD ROLE AS IT HAS NOTHING TO DO I APPRECIATE WE JUST SAY. HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BILL. IS MELENDEZ I BELIEVE YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN I WILL ASK MISTER CHIU TO PLEASE CONTINUE BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS. THAT YOUR COMMENTS REFER SPECIFICALLY TO THE BILL WITH ALL DUE RESPECT THERE ARE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL. THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME DO ADDRESS DIVERSITY BELOW THE LINE. AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND THE COALITION. A THAT WORKED ON THIS AND I ALSO A ONE I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS COMMITMENT TO WORK ON LANGUAGE TO ENSURE FOR THE FIRST TIME. THERE IS LANGUAGE TO ADDRESS DIVERSITY ABOVE THE LINE AT LEAST TO UNDERSTAND WHERE HOLLYWOOD IS AND HOW WE MOVE THIS FOR. THAT WAS IMPORTANT FOR MY SUPPORT AND THAT WAS WHAT I WANTED TO CONVEY. SO THAT BEING SAID I KNOW THE LANGUAGE IS NOT SETTLED BUT I DO TRUST THE MAJORITY LEADER OF THE AUTHOR THIS BILL TO WORK ON THIS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE HOW THE WORLD. UNDERSTANDS. HOW'RE COMMUNITIES ARE DEPICTED DEPENDS ON WHAT HOLLYWOOD DOES IN THE DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE. AND WITHOUT I AM GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT I VERY MUCH HOPE. THAT AS THIS BILL GETS CLOSER TO COMPLETION OF THAT IT DOES ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND WILL CERTAINLY BE MONITORING THIS. BOTH WITH THIS BILL AND IN THE FUTURE. WITHOUT RESPECTFULLY ASK RED ONES AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER THURMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MA'AM SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY FOUR AND I THINK OUR MAJORITY LEADER FOR HIS LEADERSHIP HERE. OBVIOUSLY IDEA AYE LINE MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS OF THOSE WHO WANT TO SEE MORE DIVERSITY. IN HOLLYWOOD AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE AUTHORS TAKEN MEASURES TO ADDRESS THAT. AYE I THINK SIMPLY. UP BEYOND THAT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON THE JOB CREATION OPPORTUNITIES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR REVENUE INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA. AND TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE MANY BUSINESSES THAT SUPPLY. THIS INDUSTRY. THAT IMPACT EVERY COMMUNITY IN OUR STATE I WOULD LOVE TO GO TO SAY THAT THE CITY OF RICHMOND IS HOLLYWOOD NORTH OR WEST OF IT BUT IT'S NOT. BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT THERE ARE BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT SUPPLY THIS S. SECTOR ON THE MORE JOBS CREATED. THE MULTIPLIER EFFECT TAKES EFFECT MORE DOLLARS ARE SPENT AND I APPRECIATE. THAT THIS ITERATION OF THE TAX CREDIT EMPHASIZES THE OPPORTUNITY TO EMPLOY THOSE WHO WORK ON IN THE INDUSTRY AND NOT JUST. IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA BUT BEHIND THE CAMERA AND IN OTHER SECTORS OF OF TECHNICAL OPPORTUNITIES OF FOR MANY ON BEHALF OF ALL THE STATE IN IN IN AND I HOPE THAT MY COLLEAGUES WILL NOT LET. ANY FEELINGS ABOUT ANY PREVIOUS TAX CREDIT THAT WASN'T SUPPORTED STOP THEM FROM VOTING FOR THIS. THE QUESTION SHOULD BE WHATEVER IN MY BELIEF WHENEVER. A TAX CREDIT IS BEFORE US WE SHOULD ASK OURSELVES A SIMPLE QUESTION. IS A TAX CREDIT WARRANTED BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO HELP TO CREATE JOBS IN OUR SECTOR IS CLEARLY A TAX CREDIT THAT WILL HELP TO CREATE JOBS RETAIN JOBS IN SUPPORT OF VERY STRONG ROBUST. CALIFORNIA ECONOMY I RESPECT WE ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER HARPER YOUR RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS. AYE AFTER WATCHING THE THE EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE MEMBER FROM MY SAN FRANCISCO AND THE MEMBER FROM RIVERSIDE COUNTY. I THINK IT UNDERSCORES THE DANGER I IN TERMS OF TREADING INTO THIS. INTO THIS FEAR. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GOVERNMENT FUNDING. IN GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE OR GOVERNMENT CREDITS. IN THIS AREA. PACIFIC WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN INDUSTRY. WHICH IS IN THE REALM OF ART. AN IS IN THE REALM OF CULTURE. AND SO THE QUESTION BECOMES. FOR AN INDUSTRY TO RECEIVE A MASSIVE TAX CREDIT LIKE THIS. SHOULD THEY BE PUSHED WITH THE HEAVY HAND OF GOVERNMENT ON THEIR CONTENT IN ORDER TO GET THE CASH. I THINK WE TRIED AND A VERY VERY. SERVING TERRITORY HERE. WHERE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE MAY BE INSERTING IT'S POLITICS IT'S CULTURAL PRIORITIES? INTO THE CONTENT. OF ARTWORK INTO THE CONTENT. OF CULTURAL PIECES. THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE NOT GET INVOLVED IN THIS SPHERE. AND THAT WE SHOULD BE INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE THE CALIFORNIA IS AN OVERALL GOOD PLACE TO DO BUSINESS FOR ALL BUSINESSES ACROSS THE BOARD WHETHER IT'S OUR TAXATION RATE. OUR LABOR LAWS ARE REGULATION AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT MAKE IT A CHALLENGE TO DO BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. LET'S MAKE CALIFORNIA MORE BUSINESS FRIENDLY OVERALL RATHER THAN TRYING TO GET INVOLVED IN PICKING LOSERS. TRYING TO CHOOSE WHOSE IN LEADING PARTS WHO IS IN MINOR PARTS IN WHO IS AN BACKING PARTS IN FILM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR FOR CONSIDERATION I URGE A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL. I THINK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY FOUR AND I WANT TO THANK OF THE LEAD AUTHOR AS WELL AS. CHAIR DAYPACK AUTISM MAYBE I CAUCUS COLLEAGUES FOR REALLY STARTING A VERY IMPORTANT DIALOGUE. THAT WILL ULTIMATELY I BELIEVE THE END UP WITH VERY POSITIVE RESULTS BECOMES A DIVERSITY. OF IN HOLLYWOOD YOU KNOW I GREW UP HERE IN CALIFORNIA I NEVER IMAGINED I'D BE THE FIRST INDIAN AMERICAN TO SERVE IN THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. BUT I'LL TELL YOU THAT WHEN I GREW UP THE ONLY TIMES I SAW ANY DEPICTION OF ANYONE TO LOOK LIKE ME THAT ANY SENSE ADAPT WAS IN BOLLYWOOD. WHEN I LOOKED IN HOLLYWOOD BUT THAT WAS THE BIG SCREEN OR ON TELEVISION OF. UNC PEOPLE LOOK LIKE ME AND IF YOU DID I DON'T THINK I'D BE VERY PROUD OF WHAT YOU SAW. AND SO THIS CONVERSATION IS LONG OVERDUE. AND I'M SO GRATEFUL THAT WE'RE HAVING OPPORTUNITY ESPECIALLY AT THIS MOMENT. ABA WHEN NOT JUST DIVERSITY BUT STORIES BEING TOLD REFLECTING WHO WE ARE AS CALIFORNIANS AND AS AMERICANS AND YES WHEN WE DO GIVE RESOURCES OR WHETHER STATE WE RESOURCES OTHERWISE THERE IS ACCOUNTABILITY THAT COMES WITH THAT. THERE'S ACCOUNTABILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE RESOURCES ARE BEING USED IN A MANNER THAT REFLECTS OUR BEST VALUES REFLECTS WHO WE ARE. AND SO I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE THAT SPOKEN IN FAVOR OF THE BILL BUT I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR. FOR EXPRESSING HIS GREAT WILLINGNESS TO WORK MUCH THE API CAUCUS BUT WITH OTHER MINORITY CAUCUSES AS WELL AS THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS TO MAKE SURE. THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THIS EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE DO SO IT WITH HER UP THOUGH THE MINDSET THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE REPRESENTS THE BEST OF WHO WE ARE. AND I ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE AS WAS REFERENCE EARLIER BY API CAUCUS CHAIR MAGGIE Q. WHO IS IT WITH US A IN THE GALLERY AS A TRAILBLAZER AS SOMEONE THAT REALLY HAS LED THIS FIGHT ON THE GROUND BEFORE IT REALLY CAME TO PROMINENCE. THAT WE STAND A REALLY A FOLLOWING HER PATH TO MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIA CAN SET THE. EXAMPLE% OF FOR THE REST THE NATION. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WALTER AND YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER IS A MADAM SPEAKER. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I DID SEE IT. OUR ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT COMMITTEE. OF. FOR MY LIFE PHONE HONEST WORK AS A POLITICIAN I ACTUALLY WORK FOR NBC SPORTS IN NEW YORK. AND THEN I MOVED OUT TO CALIFORNIA IT'S A SUNNY BURBANK A WORK IN THE CABLE TV INDUSTRY. I SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE NOT ONLY DOES IT HELP THE INDUSTRY THERE'S SO MANY ANCILLARY BEEN THAT BUSINESSES THAT BENEFIT FROM ALL THE FOOD VENDORS AND RESTAURANTS THE A CAR RENTALS AND TRUCK RENTALS ALL THE EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES OF GOING THERE WITH. ALL OF THOSE JOBS ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE INDUSTRIES A BENEFIT FROM IT AS WELL AS TAX REVENUE TO CALIFORNIA SO WE MORE THAN MAKE UP WHAT'S GIVEN OUT AS FAR AS THE BENEFIT. THOUGH AS WE KNOW AS WE SAW WITH THE HARVEY WEINSTEIN ISSUES WITH SEXUAL HARASSMENT THE INDUSTRY THAT'S ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE INDUSTRIES THAT'S BEEN IMPACTED. SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THE REASONS THAT'S INCLUDED IN THIS BILL SO I I STRONGLY URGE AN AYE. AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER EDUARDO GARCIA THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY FOUR. PARTICULARLY THE PROVISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED AS IT RELATES TO DIVERSIFYING. THE FILM INDUSTRY YOU SEE YOU KNOW I AM A STRONG BELIEVER THAT YOU KNOW THE DEPICTIONS THAT WE SEE ON TV. MOST OF THE TIMES OF PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE A WRONG STORIES ARE BEING TOLD THE FACT IS THAT. WE'RE NOT. TOTALS IN FILMS AND. OTHER CHARACTERS THAT. ARE NOT DEPICTING OF OUR COMMUNITIES WE WE ARE DOCTORS EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTORS ASTRONAUTS A P. H. D.'S WHO TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES AT UNIVERSITIES I MEAN WE. HAVE A DIVERSE GROUP OF PROFESSIONALS THAT SHOULD BE REFLECTED IN FILM BUT I I I RISE PACIFIC THE. BECAUSE OF A COMMENT THAT WAS MADE THAT WE SHOULD EXTEND THE SAME. POLICY COURTESY TO OTHER AREAS LET ME REMIND EVERYONE THAT THROUGH THE. HISTORIC BIPARTISAN. EXTENSION OF THE NATIONAL YOU WATCH CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. THE MANUFACTURING. INDUSTRIES THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. COMMUNITY RECEIVED A. GOOD. TAX EXEMPTION AS A RESULT OF THAT POLICY IN EFFECT YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME ASK THEM.

THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I AM SO I'VE HEARD A LOT OF CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW GIVING A TAX CREDIT IS GOING TO SOMEHOW MAGICALLY. MAKE HOLLYWOOD MORE DIVERSE I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN I DON'T SEE THAT IN THE BILL IF IT DOES THAT'S GREAT. MY BIGGER CONCERN IS THAT THE WHOLE REASON THAT MY WHISTLEBLOWER BILL WAS PASSED THIS YEAR WAS BECAUSE OF THE MEAT TO MOVEMENT THAT BROKE. AND IT MADE EVERYBODY FACE THE ISSUE. HOLLYWOOD STARTED THIS. SO NOW WE ARE CONTEMPLATING GIVING A TAX CREDIT TO AN INDUSTRY THAT HAS A HABIT. OF ALLOWING WOMEN TO BE MISTREATED HAS A HABIT OF ALLOWING WOMEN OF COLOR TO BE MISTREATED. OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN SO WHAT I WANT TO KNOW BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME CONVERSATIONS WHICH IS GREAT BUT I WANT TO HEAR FROM THE AUTHOR IF I MAY. WHAT ASSURANCES ARE GOING TO BE PUT INTO THIS BILL SO THAT WE CAN FEEL CONFIDENT THAT WE ARE NOT SUBSIDIZING MORE BAD BEHAVIOR BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S NOT THE BILL RIGHT NOW? I KNOW THERE'S BEEN DISCUSSION ABOUT IT AND I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT. IT'S ALL ABOUT IT'S ALL BELOW THE LINE PEOPLE IT'S NOT THE STARS IT'S NOT THE PRODUCERS THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT THE MONEY'S GOING TO BUT GUESS WHAT. IF YOU CAN SAVE MONEY AT THE BELOW THE LINE LEVEL YOU'RE ALSO SAVING MONEY AT THE ABOVE THE LINE LEVEL BECAUSE YOU HAVE MORE WITH WHICH TO WORK. SAID THIS IS NOT THIS ISN'T IT IN A SILO THAT THEY'RE THAT THEY'RE WORKING IN I'M SO I JUST WANT TO HEAR FROM THE AUTHOR OF YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE I HAVE. GREAT CONCERN WITH GIVING A TAX CREDIT TO AN INDUSTRY THAT NOT ONLY. EVERY OPPORTUNITY THEY HAVE THE SAFETY UP IN AND. SPEAK OUT AGAINST THE BAO EARS THAT I STAND FOR BUT ALSO THE VALUES THAT THIS BODY STANDS FOR GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE CONTINUE TO VOTE. FOR LEGISLATION THAT PROTECTS WOMEN THAT PROTECTS PEOPLE OF COLOR. SEPARATE I MEAN ALL OF THESE THINGS SO. IF YOU DON'T MIND. ALL DISCUSSION AND DEBATE HAVING CEASED. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALDERON WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND I AND I THINK EVERYBODY FOR THEIR COMMENTS AND YOU KNOW I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME.

INCLUDING PROCEDURES FOR REPORTING INVESTIGATING ALLEGATIONS AS WELL AS IDENTIFY A POINT PERSON FOR EACH PRODUCTIONS THAT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR RECEIVING HIS REPORTS SO THAT WE CAN MANAGE AND HAVE A POINT PERSON HAVE SOME TYPE OF POLICY PUT IN PLACE. FOR THOSE THAT ARE APPLYING FOR THIS FILM TAX CREDIT SO THAT PEOPLE IF THEY'RE BEING ABUSED OR THEY'RE BEING HARASSED HAVE SOMEWHERE TO GO AND THEIR SPECIFIC POLICY PUT IN PLACE. TO ALLOW THEM THE ABILITY TO KNOW THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAY SOMETHING IN AND WHEN THEY SAY SOMETHING THAT SOME IS GOING TO BE DONE ABOUT IT. WITH REGARDS TO I DIVERSITY IS REALLY IMPORTANT.

THE ACTORS AND EVERYBODY ELSE THAT'S INVOLVED THESE PROJECTS WHAT THAT IVERSITY BROKE BREAKDOWN IS AND TO DEVELOP SOME POLICIES ARE PROGRAMS WHICH BY THE WAY A LOT OF THESE COMPANIES ALREADY HAVE PROGRAMS TO INCLUDING TO INCREASE DIVERSITY. TO DEVELOP A PROGRAM AS WELL AS DEVELOP ONE IF THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO TO MAINTAIN A PROGRAMMER DEVELOP A PROGRAM THAT ALREADY HAVE ONE AND THEN REPORT THAT INFORMATION TO THE CALIFORNIA FILM TAX CREDIT. SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN THEN TAKE THAT INFORMATION AND PROPERLY MAKE AN ASSESSMENT ON WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO INCREASE DIVERSITY IN PRODUCTION ARE BUT THIS IS A PROUD. A PROGRAM THAT WE'VE THAT WE PASSED. SEVERAL YEARS AND IT BENEFITS A LOT OF COMMUNITIES OF BENEFITS A LOT OF PEOPLE WE CANNOT FORGET THAT THE BELOW THE LINE. THE WE KEEP FAMILIES TOGETHER BY MAKING SURE THEY'RE NOT HAVING TO GO TO OTHER STATES THAT HAVE PRODUCTION TAX CREDITS DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING FOR OUR MUSICIANS. ABOUT ARE THE ONES THAT BRING OUT HEART AND SOUL TO THESE PRODUCTIONS ARE THROUGH THE MUSIC MAKING SURE THAT THEIR JOBS ARE GOING TO BE INCLUDED IN THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE WE CARE ABOUT THOSE JOBS. ARE BUT THIS IS A GOOD PROGRAM IT'S A HUGE BENEFIT TO CALIFORNIAN INDUSTRY THAT IS HOME GROWN HERE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND NOW I ONE POINT TIME.

AB TWENTY TWENTY THREE ENSURES THAT A. CONVICTS SERVE THEIR FULL SENTENCES BY ADDING HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND SPECIFICITY CIVIC INSTANCES OF RAPE TO THE LIST OF VIOLENT CRIMES. AB TWENTY TWENTY THREE EXPANDS THE TYPES OF RAPE INCLUDED ON THE LIST OF VIOLENT CRIMES FOR THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE A VICTIM IS UNABLE TO GIVE CONSENT SUCH AS BEING IN A STATE OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS OR INTOXICATION. SERIOUSNESS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND RAPE SHOULD REQUIRE. THAT A PUNISHMENT FIT THE CRIME. SINCE THE PASSING OF PROP FIFTY SEVEN THE PERPETRATORS OF THESE CRIMES WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR EARLY PAROLE. AB TWENTY TWENTY THREE SIR STRENGTHENS THE PURPOSE OF PROP FIFTY SEVEN WHICH WAS INTENDED TO ALLOW NON VIOLENT REHABILITATED OFFENDERS. ELIGIBILITY FOR EARLY RELEASE AND NOT PERPETRATORS OF VIOLENT ACTS THIS BILL HAS RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS I'M PROUD TO BE JOINT AUTHOR ON AB TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY THREE. UNDER CURRENT LAW DIFFERENT FORMS OF RAPE ARE NOT CONSIDERED VIOLENT FELONIES. THIS BILL ENSURES AT THESE ACTS OUR CLASSIFIED AS VIOLENT CRIMES. AND THAT THE PERPETRATORS SERVE THEIR TIME.

THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER YOUR RECOGNIZED METAL SPEAKER MEMBERS CURRENTLY CALIFORNIALAW DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE CLAIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING RAPE OF AN UNCONSCIOUS PERSON.

UNDER THE CURRENT LAW. PERSONS CONVICTED THESE CRIMES OR SOME OF THE WORST PREDATORS IN OUR SOCIETY AND SHOULD NOT RECEIVE ANY SPECIAL CREDITS THAT ALLOW THEM TO GET OUT OF PRISON EARLY. IT'S KIND OF VIOLENT KNOWS CONVICTS OF THEM DESERVE TO FULFILL THEIR FULL SENTENCE THE VICTIM DESERVE FULL JUSTICE. I RESPECTFULLY URGE DRIVE VOTE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER KAMLAGER-DOVE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I GUESS THIS IS THE DAY OF TALKING ABOUT SEX AND GUNS WHICH ARE ALWAYS TOUGH ISSUES. I DO WANT TO SHARE THAT SEX CRIMES ARE ONE OF THE FEW AREAS IN THIS PENAL CODE. THAT COME WITH STACKABLE CONSECUTIVE SENTENCES WHICH MEANS YOU CAN BE A SENTENCE ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER. THE SAME PERSON FOR THE SAME INSTANCE. IN FACT THE PENAL CODE IS RICH. IN WAYS TO PROSECUTE SEX CRIMES. IF THIS IS IN RESPONSE AND I KNOW THAT I'M NEW TO AGREE JUST ACTIONS THAT FOLKS IN THE PAST HAVE DONE. I HAVE TO SAY. THEY WERE NOT NOT PROSECUTED AND NOT JAILED BECAUSE THIS LAW WAS NOT ON THE BOOKS. THEY WERE NOT PROSECUTED AND NOT JAILED BECAUSE OF THEIR PRIVILEGE. ALL THIS WILL DO WILL DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT PROSECUTORS HAVE SO MANY TOOLS AT THEIR DISPOSAL RIGHT NOW TO PROSECUTE THOSE WHO SHOULD BE CONVICTED OF SEX CRIMES. A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL IS NOT. BEING SOFT ON CRIME IT IS BEING COMMITTED. TO OUR CIVIL LIBERTIES I RESPECTFULLY URGE A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU. I. DISAGREE WITH THE STATEMENT THAT PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE. PAROLE IS NOT AUTOMATIC. PAROLE HAPPENS BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE CHANGED THEIR LIVES. WE SHOULD GIVE PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE OUR LIVES. AND TO GET OUT. AND LEAD PRODUCTIVE LIVES. THESE CRIMES ALREADY SEVERELY PUNISHED. IT IS TIME TO REALIZE. THAT LOCK THEM UP AND THROW AWAY THE KEY IS NOT THE ANSWER REDUCING RECIDIVISM. GIVING PEOPLE SERVICES. GETTING PEOPLE. TO ACCEPT THAT THEY MADE A MISTAKE AND TO TURN THEIR LIVES AROUND IS WHAT MATTERS AND THE INCENTIVE OF GETTING OUT ON PAROLE. WILL AND CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE TAKING THAT AWAY WILL NOT HELP US THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER ALLEN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. AND ON THE SIMPLY FLOOR I'M SHOCKED BY SOMETHING YOU FOR THE POLITICIANS IS SERVING THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE LET ME JUST BE VERY CLEAR. YOU JUST HEARD FROM TWO. ELECTED OFFICIALS IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE TRYING TO DEFEND. SEXUAL PREDATORS THEY'RE GUILTY OF THE FOLLOWING CRIMES. RAPE SPOUSAL RAPE SODOMY ORAL COPULATION AND SEXUAL PENETRATION BY A FOREIGN OBJECT WITH THOSE CRIMES INVOLVE THE VICTIM WE CANNOT GIVE VALID CONSENT TO SEXUAL ACTIVITY DUE TO DISABILITY OR MENTAL DISABILITY WHERE THE VICTIM CANNOT CONSENT DUE TO BEING DRUGGED OR INTOXICATED. OR THE VICTIM CANNOT GIVE CONSENT DUE TO BEING UNCONSCIOUS IT ALL A A. IT EVEN ADDS. HUMAN TRAFFICKING TO THIS LIST LISTEN. THE ONLY PERSON THAT WOULD BE IN FAVOR. OF THIS LAW NOT PASSING. I'D PROBABLY BE. SOMETHING LIKE BILL COSBY. IT SHOULD NOT BE ANY OF THE MEMBERS OF THIS FOR IT IS SHOCKING THAT ANYONE WOULD NOT VOTE YES ON THIS THIS BILL. IS PHENOMENAL THESE CRIMES ARE ATROCIOUS ANYBODY THAT IS AGAINST THIS BILL IS TRULY AGAINST JUSTICE IN CALIFORNIA. VOTE VOTE I. DOCTOR WEBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MADAM SPEAKER I WASN'T GOING TO SAY ANYTHING. SINCE WARY ONE OF THE GREAT EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE PROSECUTED I WOULD SAY DONALD TRUMP. BUT ASIDE FROM ALL OF THAT WHO ALSO WHO HAS YET TO BE TRIED FOR ALL THE COUNTY HAS ACTUALLY SAID HE DID IT. AGAINST WOMEN ALSO YOU KNOW. WE BOTH WE LOOK AT THAT ALONE WE SEE THE INCONSISTENCY IN THE SYSTEM THAT EXIST. THE TERM WHO GETS PROSECUTED WHO DOES NOT GET PROSECUTED. THIS IS A DIFFICULT BILL. AND I CITY AND WANDERED CUANDO ABOUT IT MAINLY BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN. WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS IN THE QUICKEST AND FASTEST WAY THAT WE THINK WE CAN. NO WE JUST SPENT. MUCH TIME BILLS HAVE BEEN IN THIS BUILDING FOR THE LAST. THREE OR FOUR YEARS AND THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW NOW. RECOGNIZING THAT WE HAVE SPENT TWENTY YEARS OR MORE STACKING CRIMES ON TOP OF CRIMES ON TOP OF CRIMES SPECIFYING THINGS WITH ITS CRACK COCAINE WITH ITS SEX TRAFFICKING. A WHAT WOULD ITS GANG LIST UP IN VIOLENCE AND SO FORTH AND SO ON AND PILING THESE BEINGS ON TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR FOLKS TO RECLAIM THEIR LIVES. AND WHAT WE'VE DONE IS THE OVER THE YEARS AS WE HAVE MADE AN OVERCROWDED PRISON SYSTEM. WELL WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN PRISON WE START WITH TWENTY WOMEN WENT TO HUNT IN EIGHTY. WE'RE NOW BACK DOUBTS ABOUT ONE FORTY AND WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE STILL HAVE THE LARGEST PRISON SYSTEM IN THE WORLD. YET WE DON'T HAVE ANY MORE SAFER ENVIRONMENT IN THE STATE THAN ANY OF THE STATE. AND SO IT'S INTERESTING TO ME AS I LISTEN TO THIS AND WE KEEP ADDING THESE ENHANCEMENTS ADDING THESE ADDITIONAL THINGS TO THE LIST. THAT WE ALREADY HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROSECUTE PEOPLE FOR RIGHT NOW AND WE DO. IT BOTHERS ME THAT WE HAVE NOT LEARNED FROM THE PAST. BUT WE CONTINUE TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE OVER AND OVER AGAIN BIDE ONCE AGAIN FOCUSING ON A SPECIFIC CRIME CREATING MORE DIFFICULTY IN WHAT TIME FOR PEOPLE TO SPEND IN PRISON. AND THEN WILL STAND BACK AND SAY ALL MY GOD WE HAD TO HAVE ANOTHER BILLION DOLLARS TO OUR PRISON BUDGET WHICH TAKES A BILLION OUT OF OUR SCHOOLS. AND NOW WE HAVE THIS HIGH RECIDIVISM RATE BECAUSE WERE OVERCROWDED AND WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING TO HELP PEOPLE RECLAIM THEIR LIVES. SO WE HAVE DONE WE WE TAKE ONE STEP FORWARD AND THEN FOUR STEPS BACK. WE WAS WITH FAILED TO LISTEN TO WHAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA HAS SAID ABOUT THEIR OWN PRISON SYSTEM WHEN THEY PASSED THE PROPOSITION. AND WE A COSTLY WORKING WHAT TO DO WHAT TO REBUILD A HUGE PRISON SYSTEM AGAIN. THAT MAKES IS NO SAFER THAN WE WERE BEFORE. AND WE CAN SIT AND TALK ABOUT AND DO ALL THE SCARE TACTICS IN THE WORLD ABOUT HOW HORRIBLE IT'S GOING TO BE AND WHO'S GOING TO GET OUT OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE PROTECTED. WITHOUT REALIZING THAT WE FELT NO SAFER WITH A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN PRISON THEN WE FEEL RIGHT NOW TODAY. IT'S I CAUTION YOU AS I LOOK AT THIS BECAUSE IT'S NOT THAT THOSE WHO WILL BE MAY VOTE AGAINST THIS ARE IN FAVOR OF RAPISTS AND SO FORTH AND SO ON. WHAT WE OUGHT TO BE LOOKING CAREFULLY AT WHERE WE HAVE BEEN? AND WHERE YOU WANT TO GO. WE SHOULD LEARN FROM MY HISTORY AND PEOPLE WHO DON'T LEARN FROM THEIR HISTORY ARE DOOMED TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AND SO WHAT IT SOUNDS GOOD TO JUMP ON THIS. I WANT TO CAUTION YOU ESTA WHAT ROAD WE'RE GOING DOWN AND WHERE WE HAVE BEEN AND WHERE WE THINK WE TAKE PRIDE ABOUT WHERE WE'RE GOING. INSTEAD OF UNRAVELING EVERYTHING SO QUICKLY AND MAKING OURSELVES BACK WHERE WE STARTED. WITH NOT JUST THE LARGEST PRISON SYSTEM IN THE WORLD BUT THE MOST RIDICULOUSLY LARGEST PRISON SYSTEM IN THE WORLD. I URGE YOU TO CAREFULLY THINK ABOUT THIS BILL I URGE YOU TO TAKE SOME TIME PROBABLY OTE AGAINST IT OR NOT VOTE AT ALL AND WANTED TO GIVE. FOLKS MORE TIME TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING AND NOT SIMPLY RUSH IN BECAUSE THE PUBLIC IS WATCHING US AND WE DON'T WANT TO SEEM TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF RAPISTS. I DON'T THINK ANYONE IN THIS FLOOR IS SUPPORTIVE OF RAPIST. NONE OF US ARE. AND AND WHETHER IT'S SOMEBODY WE KNOW JUST OF A DISTANCE IS NOT IT'S A VIOLENT ACT AGAINST A WOMAN AND SOMETIMES AGAINST MAN. WE'RE NOT SUPPORTIVE OF A BUT THIS IS NOT THE SOLUTION AND WE'VE DISCOVERED THAT YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR AND WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AGAIN WHAT. THE MEDIA ATTENTION I'M NOT SURE BECAUSE I'M NOT RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR BUT I DO KNOW ONE THING THAT WE HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE. AND WE SHOULD NOT GO THERE AGAIN IF WE ARE SMART.

WHEN THE COURTS THIS YEAR EARLIER RULED AND ALLOWED FOR MANY PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO BE PAROLED EARLIER BY THE WAY THIS BILL DOES NOT DO ANYTHING TO PAROLE YOU STILL. ARE ABLE TO GET PAROLED. IT A LOT IT INSURES THAT A SELECT FEW AREAS OF RAPE SODOMY. OF ORAL COPULATION AND VARIOUS OTHER AREAS WHICH IF YOU. WERE TO ADD COMMUTE OF LEE. DO NOT. DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO A GREAT NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CURRENTLY IN JAIL. BUT ON PRINCIPLE. NEED TO SERVE THEIR TIME. SO AS MUCH AS I VALUE THE ARGUMENTS THAT WERE MADE AGAINST.

THIS BILL FIX TO PROTECT ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST PRECIOUS RESOURCES. OUR BEAUTIFUL COASTLINE. FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS CALIFORNIANS HAD A BIPARTISAN. COMMITMENT TO PROTECT OUR COAST FROM OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING. SIXTY NINE PERCENT. ACCORDING THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE SIXTY NINE PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA VOTERS. OPPOSE OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING. BUT THAT LONG SANDY BIPARTISAN COMMITMENT IS BEING THREATENED. BY PRESIDENT TRUMP WHEN YOU ANNOUNCE IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR THAT HE WANTS TO REOPEN. NEW OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING LEASES UP THE COAST TO CALIFORNIA. INCLUDING SIX. NEW LEASES UP THE COAST TO CALIFORNIA. THIS NOT ONLY THREATENS OUR BEAUTIFUL COASTLINE. BUT ALSO OUR MULTI TRILLION DOLLAR. COASTAL ECONOMY MULTI DOLLAR BECAUSE ECONOMY. FORTY FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN GDP EACH YEAR. WHICH ALSO EMPLOYS ALMOST HALF A MILLION PEOPLE. THIS BILL IS SUPPORTED. NOT ONLY A TOP PRIORITY BILL. FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY. BUT IT'S ALSO SUPPORTED BY LABOR SEIU CALIFORNIA LEGAL CALIFORNIA CITIES. SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN AND MANY MANY OTHERS. I ASK FOR A AYE VOTE. THEY WITH MURATSUCHI MS THEM ON. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I AM PROUD TO STAND. WE SET OF THE CHAIR OF ASSEMBLY. NATURAL RESOURCES AS A JOINT AUTHOR OF ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FIVE. THE LEGISLATURE RECENTLY PASSED A BIPARTISAN ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION EXPRESSING OUR STRONG AN UNEQUIVOCAL OPPOSITION TO THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION STRAPLINE TO OPEN UP. ALL THREE REGIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA'S COAST TO OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS LEASING. TO DATE WE TAKEN IMPORTANT STEPS TO PUT THAT RESOLUTION INTO ACTION. FOR NEARLY THREE DECADES WE HAVE HAD A BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT THAT WE WOULD NOT EXPAND OIL DRILLING OFF THE CAP OFF CALIFORNIA'S COAST. I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FIVE AND STAND STRONG AGAINST THE IDEA. OF EXPANDING OFFSHORE OIL. THE AIM IS AMONG MISTER OUR. THIS IS. YET ANOTHER FRONT EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIA'S CITIZEN THIS IS YET ANOTHER ACTION. BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE TO TAKE AWAY YOUR ABILITY TO USE YOUR OWN NATURAL RESOURCES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE OIL AND GAS IN CALIFORNIA BELONGS TO EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIA'S CITIZEN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE THIRTY NINE MILLION PEOPLE IN THIS STATE. ALL IN THIS STATE THIS IS OUR LAND WE ARE THE CITIZENS OF THIS STATE. THIS IS OUR OIL AND GAS TODAY CALIFORNIA IMPORTS OVER SEVENTY PERCENT OF OUR ENERGY NEEDS EVERY SINGLE YEAR. THINK ABOUT THE SEVENTY PERCENT OF OUR DOLLARS GOES TO OTHER STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES WHEN WE COULD NOT ONLY BE ENERGY SELF SUFFICIENT WE COULD BEAT NET ENERGY EXPORTERS. THIS WOULD LOWER EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIANS GASOLINE BILLS IT WOULD LOWER THEIR ELECTRICITY BILLS LOWER THEIR UTILITY BILLS AND YES IT WOULD BRING MANUFACTURING JOBS BACK TO CALIFORNIA. BY LOWERING THE MOST BASIC COST OUR ENERGY COSTS IN CALIFORNIA THIS BILL. TRIES TO TAKE YET ANOTHER PIECE OF CALIFORNIA AWAY FROM CALIFORNIA CITIZENS I URGE A NO VOTE I URGE EVERY CALIFORNIA CITIZEN TO ADVOCATE FOR THEIR FULL USE OF ALL OF OUR NATURAL RESOURCES. THINK ABOUT IT LAYS THE GENTLEMAN THIS IS OUR STATE THIS IS OUR LAND. IT BELONGS TO US VOTE NOW. SURE HARPER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. I THINK THE DISCUSSION ON THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN MISLEADING BECAUSE THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE REGARDING OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING. ARE TO PARK. STATE JURISDICTION IS WITHIN THREE MILES OF THE COAST LINE AND NOBODY'S DEBATING HERE WHETHER OR NOT TO HAVE ANY EXPANDED OIL PRODUCTION OR ANY NEW PLATFORMS WITHIN THAT AREA. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I AM VERY PERFECTLY CLEAR I'M IN OPPOSITION TO ANY NEW PLATFORMS. WITHIN OUR STATE WATERS I'M ALSO VERY AWARE THAT THERE'S NOT INTEREST I ESPECIALLY IN ORANGE COUNTY AREA AYE IN HAVING NEW NEW NEW PLATFORMS IT'S JUST NOT THERE BECAUSE THE OIL. FIELD IN THE AREA HAS BEEN PUMP FOR ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YEARS AND IT ALREADY HAS THE A BILL BUT. FOLKS WHO ARE OR PRODUCING WELL ALREADY HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO GET TO THE OIL AYE THAT IS WITHIN THE AREA. WHAT'S IT QUESTION HERE IS NOT THE STATE WATERS IT'S ABOUT THE FEDERAL WATERS AND WHETHER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO TRY TO BLOCK. TRANSPORTATION OF ANY NEW PRODUCTION FROM FEDERAL WATERS WHICH I WOULD ARGUE ISA VIOLATION OF INTERSTATE COMMERCE WITHIN OUR COUNTRY. WE'RE NOT HERE TO JUST SIMPLY BLOCKED THIS IS LIKE SAYING THAT YOU CAN HAVE. ANY OIL LOW ON OIL CARS ON A RAILROAD COMING THROUGH A CERTAIN PART OF CALIFORNIA. I THIS IS JUST SIMPLY BLOCKING COMMERCE THROUGH THE STATE WATERS. FEDERAL WATERS ARE A QUESTION FOR CONGRESS. AND THAT'S JUST SIMPLY WORD IS YOU WANT TO RUN FOR CONGRESS IN DETERMINE WHAT'SIN THE WHAT'S A DRILLED IN THE FEDERAL RODDERS THAT IS YOUR CHOICE TO BE ABLE TO DO SO IN ANY PARTICULAR ELECTION YEAR. BUT IN TERMS OF STATE WATERS THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS AFFECTS I URGE A NO VOTE BECAUSE. I THINK THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE VIOLATING THAT INTERSTATE COMMERCE THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO BE ABLE TO FLOW. FROM THE FEDERAL WATERS ON TO THE MAINLAND THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I URGE A NO VOTE. SEEING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE MISTER MERCY SHE MAY. CLOSE IF YOU WISH THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN. ASKED TO. THE COMMENTS RAISED BY MY TO. COLLEAGUES FROM ORANGE COUNTY. SIXTY NINE PERCENT. IT'S A LOT OF CALIFORNIA VOTERS. AS TO THE. CALIFORNIA'S RIGHT TO PROTECT OUR OWN COASTLINE. I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM. HUNTINGTON BEACH. THAT THE. THE TRUMP PROPOSAL IS TALKING ABOUT WHETHER TO ALLOW ANY NEW. OFFSHORE DRILLING IN FEDERAL WATERS THE CALIFORNIA HAS A RIGHT TO PROTECT OUR COASTLINE IN CALIFORNIA HAS THE RIGHT. IN FACT THE DUTY AND THE RESPONSIBILITY TO. CONTROL WHAT HAPPENS IN THE STATE WATERS SO THIS BILL. IS DESIGNED TO. PROHIBIT ANY NEW OIL RIGS OR ANY NEW INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT WOULD SUPPORT ANY NEW OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING. THE. BUILDING TRADES ARE NEUTRAL ON THIS BILL BECAUSE IT IS NOT. GOING TO AFFECT ANY EXISTING. OFFSHORE OIL DEVELOPMENT. AND WITH THAT CLARIFICATION ASK FOR AYE VOTE.

CORPORATE. ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY EIGHTY BY SOME REMEMBER GONZALEZ FLETCHER AN ACCOLADE TO EMPLOYMENT. MS GONZALEZ FLETCHER. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. I WANT TO LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED SOME OF THE STRONGEST WORKER PROTECTIONS IN THE COUNTRY AGAINST SEXUAL HARASSMENT. PAY INEQUITY DISCRIMINATION BASED ON RACE RACE SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR ABILITY AND AGREE JUST LABOR VIOLATIONS LIKE WAGE THEFT HOWEVER THOSE LAWS ARE WORTHLESS IF THEY CANNOT BE ENFORCED IN COURT OR BY STATE AGENCY BECAUSE AN EMPLOYER HAS FORCED THEIR WORKERS TO SIGN AWAY THEIR RIGHTS. IN AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. MANDATING THAT EMPLOYEES GO TO ARBITRATION IS A PRACTICE WHICH ALLOWS COMPANIES TO FORCE EMPLOYEE COMPLAINTS INTO SECRETIVE HEARINGS WHICH HIDES LABOR VIOLATIONS FROM THE PUBLIC. SILENCE HIS VICTIMS WITH NON DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS AND OFTEN PROTECTS SERIAL OFFENDERS. ARBITRATION TO BE A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION METHOD WHEN EVERYBODY CHOOSES TO ENTER IT VOLUNTARILY. THIS IS WHY A. B. THIRTY EIGHTY DOES NOT PROHIBIT EMPLOYERS FROM USING ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS TO SOLVE. OR RESOLVE WORKPLACE DISPUTES INSTEAD IT SIMPLY REQUIRES EMPLOYEES CHOOSE TO SIGN SUCH AGREEMENTS AND THAT'S NOT CAN DID CONTINGENT UPON THEM GETTING A JOB. AB THIRTY EIGHTY ALSO DOES NOT RENDER ANY EXISTING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT UNENFORCEABLE. AS AN ADDITIONAL PROTECTION A. B. THIRTY EIGHTY ENSURES A WORKER INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS NOT PROHIBITED FROM DISCLOSING ANY INSTANCE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. THAT THEY SUFFER OR DISCOVER IN THE WORKPLACE IN ORDER PURSUE OR KEEP A JOB IN EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. THIS IS A PRIORITY WOMEN'S CAUCUS BILL AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. WITH YOUR KILEY. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I THE PROPONENTS WOULD HAVE YOU BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WILL SOMEHOW HELP I TO ADDRESS THE EXTREMELY SERIOUS PROBLEM. OF SEXUALHARASSMENT AND OTHER WORKPLACE MISCONDUCT I IT DOES NO SUCH THING. WHAT THE BILL REALLY DOES IS PUSH FOR A LONG STANDING PREEXISTING POLITICAL AGENDA? DESIGNED TO FINANCIALLY BENEFIT ONE GROUP AT THE EXPENSE OF WORKERS. AND VICTIMS. THE BILL'S GOAL IS TAKE MORE AND MORE CASES AWAY FROM THE FORUM OF ARBITRATION. WHERE VICTIMS CAN RECEIVE COMPENSATION MORE QUICKLY? WITH A LOWER LEGAL COSTS AND WITH GREATER FLEXIBILITY AND MOVE THOSE CASES INTO ARE ALREADY OVERWHELMED COURTS. WHERE PROCEEDINGS ARE MORE PROTRACTED AND THOUGHTS BEES FOR LAWYERS ARE OF COURSE MUCH MUCH HIGHER? THIS BILL IS NOT LIMITED TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIMS BUT. SWEEPS IN ALL CLAIMS UNDER THE FLARE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT AND THE LABOR CODE. IT ALSO DOES NOT GIVE. WORKERS ANY NEW SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS BUT SIMPLY CHANGES THE FORUM IN WHICH CLAIMS WILL BE ADJUDICATED. THIS MEANS THAT IF YOU'RE A VICTIM OF DISCRIMINATION BASED ON AGE DISABILITY FAMILY CARE STATUS SACKS ARE OF YOUR VICTIM OF RETALIATION OR YES SEXUAL HARASSMENT. YOUR ONLY OPTION FORGETTING JUSTICE WILL BE LITIGATION. NOW SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE SHOWN. THIS IS NOT A REALISTIC OPTION. FOR LOW WAGE EMPLOYEES. WHO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD A LAWYER? WHO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO WAIT YEARS? IN ORDER TO RECEIVE COMPENSATION WHO MAY WORK MULTIPLE JOBS AND NOT HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY IN ORDER TO PROSECUTE A YEARS LONG CIVIL ACTION AS ONE ARTICLE IN THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW PUT IT. THE VAST MAJORITY OF ORDINARY LOWER AND MIDDLE INCOME EMPLOYEES CANNOT GET ACCESS TO THE COURTS TO VINDICATE THEIR CONTRACTUAL OR STATUTORY RIGHTS THERE ARE ONLY PRACTICAL HOPE IS THE GENERALLY CHEAPER. FASTER AND MORE INFORMAL PROCESS OF ARBITRATION. NUMEROUS STUDIES ALSO SHOW. THAT EMPLOYEES GENERALLY WIN THE SAME PERCENTAGE OF CASES IN ARBITRATION. IF NOT MORE. NOW TO BE FAIR THERE IS SOME CONFLICTING DATA ON THIS POINT I GOVERNOR BROWN FOR HIS PART IN VETOING A SIMILAR BILL. A FEW YEARS AGO SAID THIS THE EVIDENCE ON ACTUAL OUTCOMES AN ARBITRATION VERSES LITIGATION IS CONFLICTING AND UNCLEAR. WITH SOME STUDIES SHOWING EMPLOYEES RECEIVING MORE IN ARBITRATION WHILE OTHER STUDIES SHOW THE OPPOSITE BUT EVEN IF IT'S A WASH. ARBITRATION IS STILL VASTLY PREFERABLE FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF EMPLOYEES BECAUSE MORAL BE ABLE GET ACCESS TO IT. THEY'RE POSSIBLY MUCH LOWER THAN BE ABLE TO KEEP MORE OF THEIR AWARD RATHER THAN GOING TO ATTORNEYS AND THEY'LL GET THE REWARDS MORE QUICKLY. AND WITH GREATER FINALLY. FOR THOSE REASONS THIS BILL WILL DO GREAT DAMAGE. TO WORKERS AND TO VICTIMS BY LIMITING THEIR ACCESS. TO JUSTICE BUT PERHAPS WORST OF ALL. THE BILL ALSO MAKES VICTIMS IN SOME CASES THE LESS LIKELY TO COME FORWARD. FOR THOSE WHO WOULD PREFER THE CONFIDENTIALITY OFFERED BY ARBITRATION I WOULD NOT RATHER NOT HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES. IN OPEN COURT OVER POTENTIALLY SEVERAL YEARS. IN ANY CASE THIS BILL IS OBVIOUSLY PREEMPTED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE JUST LIKE A BILL THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. PURPORTING TO LIMIT ARBITRATION WAS JUST STRUCK DOWN BY CALIFORNIA APPELLATE COURT THIS YEAR BUT IN THE MEANTIME IN THE YEARS IN WHICH THE BILL IS IN LEGAL THEM LEGAL LIMBO. IT'LL CAUSE GREAT HARM TO WORKERS TO VICTIMS AND OUR STATE AS A WHOLE I URGE A NO VOTE. DOCTOR WEBER. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MISTER SPEAKER UP. THIS GIVES ME AN MEMBERS. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF ALL A B. THIRTY EIGHTY AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS NOT A. PROEHL NORD ANTI ARBITRATION BILL. THIS IS REALLY ABOUT CHOICE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO CHOOSE IF THEY WANT TO ENGAGE IN ARBITRATION. IT SHOULD NOT BE FORCED UPON YOU AS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT BUT IF YOU WANNA TAKE THIS JOB YOU MUST SIGN THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN ADVANCE. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT IF YOU WANT TO SIGN THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. AND SO WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT IS GOING TO BE FASTER AND CHEAPER AND SO FORTH AND SO ON MAYBE IT WILL BE AND IF IT IS A CHOICE THAT YOU MAKE. WHICH YOU SHOULD NOT BE FORCED TO SIGN IT IN ORDER TO GET A JOB AND THAT'S THE THING THAT'S IMPORTANT YOU TALK ABOUT DENIAL OF JUSTICE THAT IS THE DENIAL OF JUSTICE IN ITSELF IF I CAN'T CHOOSE. WHETHER I WANT TO GO TO COURT OF ARBITRATION BECAUSE I'M FORCED TO SIGN ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS IN ADVANCE THEM THAT BASICALLY DENIES MY RIGHT TO GO TO COURT AND TO HAVE WHATEVER FORM OF JUSTICE IN LITIGATION THAT OCCURS. IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT PEOPLE IN ARBITRATION ARE NOT REQUIRED TO FOLLOW THE LAW. AND MANY OF YOU DON'T KNOW MAY NOT KNOW THAT BUT IF THEY ARE NOT REQUIRED TO FOLLOW THE LAW WHEN YOU DEAL WITH ARBITRATORS. I KNOW BECAUSE I WANT TO ARBITRATION ONCE I'LL NEVER GO AGAIN BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT REQUIRED TO FOLLOW THE LAW AND THE AND THEREFORE YOU BASICALLY MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHAT YOU THINK IS BEST THE ARBITRATOR DOES. IT IS NOT ALWAYS THE BEST FORM OF GOVERNMENT YES IT IS FAST IT'S QUICK BUT YOU DON'T ALWAYS GET THE JUSTICE THAT YOU WANT. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT HOW HORRIBLE ARBITRATION IS HOW WONDERFUL ARBITRATION IS THIS IS SAYS THAT I SHOULD BE ABLE TO CHOOSE IF I WANT TO GO TO ARBITRATION. ARE NOT AND THAT SHOULD BE THE CHOICE OF THE INDIVIDUALS AND NOT SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE DECIDED THAT THEY MUST DO IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A JOB. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT FOR A BI THIRTY EIGHTY BECAUSE THIS REALLY ABOUT CHOICE MUCH MORE THAN EITHER ONE OF THE OTHER CHOICES THAT OF THEIR. THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER MISTER HARPER. MR IN SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I WANT TO KNOW THAT I'M HEARING A LOT OF GREAT. REASONS WHY A. SOMEONE SHOULD NOT BE FORCED TO PAY INTO A UNION. AS A CONDITION. OF HAVING A JOB. THAT WAS A. I'M SORRY MS WEBB DOCTOR WEBER STAGE POINT OF ORDER. YES I WANTED CLARIFICATION ON ON WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT. WELL WE'RE NOT GOING INTO BACK OKAY I WAS JUST CURIOUS OUTBREAK HOW IT RELATED TO THE. THANK YOU TO WHOEVER WILL. LOOK FOR ANY OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION SEEING AND HEARING NINE. MS GONZALEZ FLETCHER YOU MAY CLOSE. I JUST WANNA. TO RESPOND TO TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM. SOMEWHERE NORTH OF ME FRESNO. AND IN SAY THIS THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS BILL. THAT WOULD NOT ALLOW SOMEBODY TO SEEK ARBITRATION. AND IF THIS BELIEF AS THE OPPONENTS WOULD HAVE IT THAT ARBITRATION IS SO GOOD FOR WORKERS ESPECIALLY LOW WAGE WORKERS THEY WILL STILL HAVE THAT AS AN OPTION. TO RESOLVE A DISPUTE AT WORK BUT THAT HAVE OTHER OPTIONS TO. THEY CAN GO TO THE LABOR COMMISSIONER WHAT YOU DON'T NEED AN ATTORNEY FOR BECAUSE UNDER ARBITRATION YOU CAN'T DO THAT UNDER FORCE ARBITRATION. THEY COULD GO TO COURT ESPECIALLY IF THERE WERE MORE THAN ONE OF THEM THAT THIS WAS HAPPENING TO. BUT WHAT WE KNOW IS THIS ARBITRATION HAS BEEN A TOOL. FOR EMPLOYERS TO KEEP A SECRET SERIAL OFFENDERS WHEN IT COMES TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT WHEN IT COMES TO SEXUAL ASSAULT. THEY REQUIRE PEOPLE THE SIGN AND DA'S THAT'S WHY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STAY ON THE JOB CONTINUALLY HARASSED SEEN WOMEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN WITHOUT ANYONE KNOWING IT. BECAUSE IT'S A SECRET PROCESS. IT'S BEEN ABLE IT'S USED TO SHIELD. HARASSERS THIS ISN'T A PARTISAN ISSUE MANY OF YOU KNOW GRETCHEN CARLSON FROM FOX AND FRIENDS CAME OUT I DON'T THINK WE'RE IN THE SAME IDEOLOGICAL SPEAR. SUSAN ABOUT UNIONS THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE. EVERY WORKER HAS A MARKET PLACE OF REMEDIES AVAILABLE IF THEY'RE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST ON THE JOB IF THEY'RE SALTED IF THEY'RE HARASSED IF THEIR WAGES ARE STRONG IF THEY HAVE PAY INEQUITIES. AND THIS IS A BILL WHOSE TIME HAS COME.
