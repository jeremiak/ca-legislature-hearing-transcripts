PLEASE JOIN ME IN ON A PLUS TO CELEBRATE OF THE HARD WORK. THANK YOU SO CHIANG WELCOME TO YOUR CAL STATE FOR. SENATOR ALLEN WHAT PURPOSE YOU RISE MEMBERS I UNDER PROVISIONS THE FLOOR I JUST WANTED TO. BRIEFLY KNOWLEDGE TODAY IS THE SEVENTY FIFTH ANNIVERSARY THE LIBERATION OF AUSCHWITZ. IT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER. YOU KNOW THE SIX MILLION JEWISH MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN MURDERED IN THE HOLOCAUST OVER ONE MILLION OF THEM PERISHED AT THAT ONE PARTICULAR DEATH CAMP ALONE. BOTH IN SYMBOL AND IT IMPACT US IF IT'S REALLY TRULY REPRESENTS THE WORST. OF HUMANITY IT WAS THE IT'S THE GREATEST SINGLE MASS MURDER SITE. IN HUMAN HISTORY. SEVENTY FIVE YEARS AFTER THE LIBERATION OF THE CAMP BY SOVIET FORCES SADLY OUR COLLECTIVE MEMORY OF THIS ATROCITY IS FADING. A RECENT STUDY REVEALED THAT TWO THIRDS OF MILLENNIALS DO NOT KNOW WHAT OUTFITS WISE. IN ALMOST A QUARTER HAVE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF THE HOLOCAUST. THIS IS ONE OF THE MANY REASONS WHY THE LIST OF JEWISH CAUCUS BELIEVES THAT IT IS ESSENTIAL AND COMPELLING. TO BRING HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS. STREETS WITNESSES TO UNCHECKED. TO THE STATE CAPITAL FOR A REMEMBRANCE CEREMONY EVERY YEAR SO THAT WE AS A LIVING BODY. EACH BECOME AMBASSADORS FOR THEIR STORIES. TRAGICALLY TODAY WE FIND OURSELVES IN THE MIDST OF A RISING HATE MOTIVATED VIOLENCE TARGETING CHOOSE ANOTHER VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT AMERICA MURDERS IN CHARLOTTESVILLE PITTSBURG POWER AWAY JERSEY CITY MANSI. VIOLENT ASSAULTS IN NEW YORK AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY COMMITTED BY PEOPLE WHO BUY INTO THE SAME ANTI SEMITIC NARRATIVE FROM THREE QUARTERS OF A CENTURY AGO. THAT HELPED US IN SIX USED THEIR DEATH. ONE OF MY MOST DAYS OF MY LIFE WAS SPENT WALKING THE GROUNDS OF THE AUSCHWITZ BIRKENAU. CAMP AND I'M NOT A SUPERSTITIOUS MAN BUT THERE THE PLACE IS FILLED WITH GHOSTS- IT WAS A POWERFUL EXPERIENCE AND THEN LEAD A DELEGATION OF LEGISLATORS JUST A COUPLE MONTHS AGO TO. IS WHERE WE WERE ABLE TO GET A SHAMAN EASY AND MEMORIES COST. LEARN ABOUT THE ATROCITIES IN ALSO CELEBRATE THE- EXTENT TO WHICH TO MOVE PAST. THAT DARK HISTORY. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THERE CONTINUES TO BE SO MUCH THAT WE NEED TO COMBAT. IN THE AREA OF ANTI SEMITISM AND FEATURED. AND SO TODAY ON THE MOMENTOUS ANNIVERSARY OF THE LIBERATION OF AUSCHWITZ AS WE CELEBRATE THAT THAT MOMENT. THE FACT THAT THOSE THE CIVILIZED WORLD CAME TOGETHER TO DEFEAT THE **** SCORCH. AS IN SAYS HISTORY INCHES AWAY FROM. THE WHOLE ACOSTA TEMPORARILY. WE REAFFIRM OUR SOLEMN COMMITMENT TO THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATING THE NEXT GENERATION OF CALIFORNIANS AMERICANS AND FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS TO ENSURE THAT WE EMBODY THE PROMISE OF NEVER AGAIN. THANK YOU MEMBERS. THANK YOU SENATOR ALLEN SENATOR MITCHELL FOR WHAT PURPOSE YOU RISE. TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE SEVENTY FIFTH ANNIVERSARY PLEASE PROCEED- THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE AYE IN THE THIRTIETH AND DISTRICT OF REPRESENTING THE SIMON WIESENTHAL CENTER. AND WE'VE HAD NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS ON THIS FLOOR ON ANNIVERSARY SUCH AS THIS ABOUT THE NEXT GENERATION AND THE NEXT GENERATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW THEIR HISTORY. I HAVE TO SAY THAT OUR I EIGHT IT IT. I WAS GONNA SAY WARMS MY HEART BACK IF IT DOES WARM MY HEART- ANY DAY OF THE WEEK THAT I'M DRIVING DOWN PICO DRIVING WEST ON PICO THAT I'VE SEEN SCHOOL CHILDREN LINED UP. TO GET INTO THE FAMILIES INVOLVED. WHICH IS NOT. A LIGHT AND FANTASTIC SCHOOL FIELD TRIP. IT'S A FIELD TRIP THAT WOULD BE IT'S A FIELD TRIP THAT I BELIEVE WHAT FEEL CHIP SHOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE IN THE COMMUNITY AND APPLY- YOUR SCHOOL TEX LEARNINGS TO COMMUNITY BASED EXPERIENCE A LEARNING. AND SO I AM HOPING THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THAT AS A STATE THAT WE CONTINUE TO FUND SPACES AND PLACES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO CONTINUE TO BE REMINDED OF HISTORY ON BOTH THE GOOD AND THE PAINFUL BECAUSE WE DON'T MAKE KNOW OUR HISTORY. WE ARE SUBJECT TO MAKE THOSE STEAKS AND SO WE AS OTHER GUARDIANS IN SO MANY WAYS HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY THAT WE CAN'T FAULT THEM FOR NOT KNOWING IF WE HAVEN'T TAKEN THE TIME TO MAKE SURE THEY DO. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL JACKSON. I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP IN THERE FOR A MOMENT BECAUSE- I'M OFTEN STRUCK BY A STORY THAT I LEARNED. WHEN AUSCHWITZ WAS IT JUST BEFORE WAS LIBERATED THE- THIRD REICH DECIDED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO TRY TO WALK THOSE WHO HAD SURVIVED ON A DEATH MARCH. THEY TOOK FIFTY SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE AND THEY MARCHED THEM THROUGH POLAND. HOPING THAT THEY WOULD DIE ALONG THE WAY SO THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE. THE VOICE OF HISTORY WHEN THE THIRD REICH ENDED. AN I REMEMBER A STORY THAT I HEARD AND AGAIN WE ARE LOSING THOSE WHO WERE THE VICTIMS THEY'RE DYING. THE OLD- AND AS A RESULT WE HEAR YOU YOUNG PEOPLE AND OTHERS WHO DENY THE HOLOCAUST EXISTED. NOW REPLACING THAT VOICE WITH THE VOICE OF THE NILE WITH THE VOICE OF HATRED. WITH THE VOICE OF DE HUMANIZATION BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY WE CAN KILL EACH OTHER IS IF WE DE HUMANIZE THE ENEMY. THEY'RE NOT PEOPLE THEY DON'T HAVE CHILDREN THEY AREN'T SOMEONE'S CHILDREN THEY ARE TO BROTHER A MOTHER OR FATHER. BUT THIS STORY. BURKE WITH ME IS STUCK WITH ME FOR YEARS IT'S A STORY OF A YOUNG OF A WOMAN WAS A YOUNG GIRL. I WAS BEING TAKEN OFF TO. THE CAMPS AND HER FATHER WHO WAS BEING SEPARATED FROM HER SAID SOMETHING TO WHERE HE SAID NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS. MAKE SURE YOU TAKE YOUR SHOES. MAKE SURE YOU TAKE YOUR SHOES. SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO WAS MARCHED. ON THE DEATH MARCH AT THE END OF WORLD WAR TWO IT WAS THE FACT THAT SHE HAD CHOOSE. THE KEPT HER ALIVE. BECAUSE OTHERS WHO WALK THAT WALK WERE BAREFOOTED OR WHO SHOES DID NOT SURVIVE AND THEY THEN BECAME SICK AND DIED OF FROSTBITE OR THEY WERE SHOCKED. BUT IT'S A STORY ABOUT A DAD TELLING HIS DAUGHTER REMEMBER WHAT EVER HAPPENS TAKE YOUR SHOES. THAT TO ME IS PART OF THE SYMBOL OF WHY WE MUST REMEMBER. BECAUSE EVERY CHILD EVERY PERSON. NEEDS TO HAVE THEIR SHOES. DOESN'T MATTER THE COLOR OF YOUR SKIN OR YOUR ETHNICITY OR YOUR GENDER IT IS OUR COMMON HUMANITY THERE WILL EITHER BRING US TOGETHER SO THAT WE ALL SURVIVE OR IT WILL DE HUMANIZATION OF THAT HUMANITY THAT DESTROYS US AND SO ON THIS SEVENTY FIFTH ANNIVERSARY I HOPE THAT WE RECOGNIZE AND TEACH OUR YOUNGSTERS OUR CHILDREN ARE FAMILY MEMBERS REMIND THEM. THAT IT IS THE HUMANITY THAT KEEPS US ALIVE AS NOT ONLY A NATION BUT IS A WORLD INTO THAT HUMANITY IS BEING CHARGED ABOUT THE WORLD LET US NOT. WHEN ELSE REMEMBER WE ALL NEED THOSE SHOES THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON CENTER JONES THANK YOU MA'AM PRESIDENT ALSO LIKE TO STAND IN RECOGNITION THE SEVENTY FIFTH ANNIVERSARY NOT SURE ON THIS FLOOR IN THE- IN THE ASSEMBLY SEVERAL TIMES MY- BROTHER'S EX AND SAYS APPEARED ENGINE AND BUT WHAT I HAVEN'T SHARED IS. MY MOTHER. HAS IN IT FROM ME UP PRIOR TO WORLD WAR TWO AND I HAVEN'T HAD THE OPPORTUNITY YET TO TRACK BACK TO AND SEE THE MEMORIAL THERE OR TO WASHINGTON DC TO SEE THE MUSEUM THERE. BUT I WAS SHOCKED ONE DAY. I AS I WAS WALKING THROUGH THE DEL MAR FAIR. IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY THAT THERE WAS A TRAVELING. MEMORIAL OF THE HOLOCAUST. AND I'VE DONE SOME LITTLE BIT OF STUDY OF WORLD WAR TWO IN THE HISTORY THERE BUT- NOT A DETAILED HISTORY OR EXPERIENCE ABOUT IT. AND THE TRAVELING HOLOCAUST MUSEUM REALLY WASN'T THAT BIG MAYBE TEN PANELS AT TEN FEET BY TEN FEET. WITH PICTURES IN AND DISPLAYS AND. ITEMS FROM THE HOLOCAUST OF WORLD WAR TWO. AND TAKES MAYBE TWENTY MINUTES TO GO THROUGH THAT TRAVELING. DISPLAY AND IN THAT TWENTY MINUTES THE SHOCK. AND THE TERROR AND THE FEAR. AND THAT I EXPERIENCED JUST FROM LOOKING AT THE PICTURES AND EXPERIENCING THE ITEMS THAT WERE ON DISPLAY THERE. WAS INCREDIBLE. AND I LEFT THAT- THAT SHORT DISPLAY WITH WITH TO- CHARGES FOR MYSELF IN LIFE NUMBER ONE TO MAKE SURE THAT I SHARE WITH OTHERS THAT EXPERIENCE AND ENCOURAGE OTHERS THAT WHEN THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO THROUGH A MEMORIAL LIKE THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GO THROUGH A MORE LIKE THAT EXPERIENCE FOR YOURSELF. AND NUMBER TWO. THAT I MAKE IT A PERSONAL. CHALLENGE FOR MYSELF TO ALSO NEVER FORGET AND THAT HISTORY DOESN'T REPEAT ITSELF AND WE ALL REMAIN VIGILANT. AGAINST ATROCITIES LIKE THIS AND MAKE SURE THAT WE STAND AND FIGHT AGAINST THEM BECAUSE WHEN I THINK OF THE JEWISH CAUCUS LEADERS FIVE FOR RECOGNIZING THIS TODAY AND GIVING US ALL AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE- WITH IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR JONES THUNDERSTORM. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I DON'T ADD TOO MUCH MORE VERY ARTICULATE WORDS HAVE BEEN SPOKEN I JUST. THIRD ED ONE NOTE MAYBE ONE APPEAL THAT THESE MUSEUMS IN EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND MOMENT OF REMEMBRANCE LIKE THIS ARE CRUCIAL BUT WE STILL HAVE A VERY NARROW WINDOW TO SEE HISTORY LIVING IN OUR OWN COMMUNITIES. I HAPPEN TO LIVE WITH ONE SOME OF THE TIME IS MY FATHER IN LAW I NEED THOSE YOU SEE A PLUMBING TRUCK DRIVING AROUND LA DRIVEN BY A GUY WHO LOOKS LIKE SHOULD PROBABLY NOT BE DRIVING THAT TRUCK FIRST OF ALL RESTAURANT IS A VERY GOOD DRIVER BUT YOU YOU SEE JOSH WAS PLAN AND DRIVING A LOS ANGELES WITH AMERICAN IT ISRAEL FLAGS ON TOP. YOU'LL KNOW THAT VIEW FULL STILL HANG ON SO LAST THING I WOULD I WOULD JUST ADD IS THAT. IS THESE TRAGEDIES ALMOST. ENORMOUS CON. BUT THE SIMPLE ACT OF EATING LUNCH WITH SOMEBODY IN YOUR DISTRICT. AND TAKING THAT SMALL INTIMATE MOMENT AND THAT KINDA HAS TO BE LIKE. THIS YEAR NEXT YEAR LIKE WE GOT. A VERY VERY NEAR WANNA. TAKE THOSE MALL MOM. BECAUSE IT TEACHES YOU SO MUCH. ABOUT HOW TO LIVE YOUR LIFE. IN THE SMALL WAYS NOT JUST PREVENT THE GENOCIDES AND THE MASSIVE WAVES A HATRED BUT- THE TINY ACTS OF DECENCY THE PUNCTUATE OUR DAY.

SKINNER SKINNER YOU PREPARE FOR FILE ITEM NINETEEN MOUNT SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL SEVEN SEVENTY SIX BY SENATOR SKINNER AN ACT RELATING TO POST SECONDARY EDUCATION THE- SKINNER FOR YOURS THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS SO. I THINK WE KNOW THAT EDUCATION IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SINGLE ACTIONS TO IMPROVE AN INDIVIDUAL'S FUTURE. BOTH THEIR- ABILITY TO GET BETTER INCOME BETTER JOB ADVANCE THEIR FAMILY YOU NAME IT. BUT PEOPLE IMPACTED THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM STILL USED TO HER A- SO WHILE WE ARE EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR HIGHER ED WITH IN BOTH OUR JAIL AND PRISON SYSTEM WE HAVE YES YOUR COMMUTE COLLEGES YOU SEE. ALL OFF NOT ONLY PURSES BUT THE PROGRAM. IN THE HIGH THE FIRST. WE STILL HAVE COLLEGES THAT ON MISSION CATION AT ABOUT ONE HISTORY. NOW I IS THIS SIMPLE TO MAKE WHAT REALLY MATTER HOW. WHAT A NEW YORK STUDY RE. THAT TWO OF IN THE- WITH A CRIMINAL OFFENSE RECORD STOPPED CATION. IT SAW THAT THE QUESTION WAS BEING A STE THIS BIG MAMA OF FEELING THAT IT WOULD PRESS. THERE THEIR ABILITY TO GET INTO SCHOOL. SO THEY JUST DIDN'T UP. THE UCC THE CS SYSTEM OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM NO LONGER HAVE THIS QUESTION ON THEIR APPLICATION AND SO WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IS MOVE. THAT CHIN FROM MARK APPLET FORM NOW. RIGHT THERE BEEN SOME ISSUES BROUGHT UP IN COMMITTEE ELSEWHERE AROUND THERE ARE FOR EXAMPLE SOME GRADUATE PROGRAMS WHERE A CERTAIN CRIMINAL OFFENSE MIGHT PRECLUDE YOU FROM PURSUING THEIR PROFESSION. IT MAY BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IN ADVANCE SO THAT YOU WE THE CONSUMERUP ON EDUCATE PROGRAM KNOW THAT YOU WILL NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY POTENTIALLY TO USE THAT TO CREATE- BUT- AND I'VE DONE. IS WE- FINISH MISTAKE EATING TALKED SERRA COLLEGES IN GRAD PRO. AROUND THE OF WHAT IN SINCE WAR CIRCA. IS THIS QUESTION MAYBE STAY ON NASA. DUE TO. ON PRACTICE OF THE PROFESSION I'M COMMITTED. TO CAN YOU BACK DISCUSSION IN SEEING WERE TWEAKS ME NECESSARY BUT I HOPE THAT YOU WOULD WITH TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL SO THE WEEK GET IT OFF OF OUR FLOOR IT WILL. COME IN CAN. BUT WE BE IN. THE KNOW THEY CALL PROCESS. I DO. SOME P. REYES THE CAN. ABOUT SAVE US OFFENDER LIVE IN A CALL DORM. NOW ARE SO OFFENDER. ALREADY REQUIRES THAT IF A PERSON IS EITHER IN ROLE THAT A SCHOOL INCLUDING COLLEGE. FOR HOT. THAT IT MUST WITHIN FIVE DAYS OF EITHER THEY'RE STARTING THE SCHOOL. THEY'RE WORKING AT. THE FORM THE SCHOOL OF THAT SIR. AND NOW ALL OTHER RULES THAT APPLY TO LIMITATIONS ON A SEXUAL REGISTRANT WOULD STILL APPLY THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE ANY OF THOSE AND AMPLE I'M STEPPING LIKE TO. EIGHT REGISTRY IS NOT PROTECTED UNDER FOR. THE FOR FAIR HOW LAW SO THE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT THE THOSE ARE COMPLETELY SEPARATE FROM THE BILL IN THE BILL DOES NOT TOUCH ANY OF THOSE EXISTING PROTECTION. WHICH WE HAVE. THAT HOPE THAT WE CAN FIND COMMON GROUND AND THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND THAT THOSE OF YOU WHO MAY BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROGRAMS WERE THE NECESSARY. ACTION WOULD SEE THAT WE ARE. ENGAGING IN THAT STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND WE'LL HAVE SOME. IN WHEN IT COMES BACK FOR CONCURRENCE SKINNER MEMBER UNDER DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SENATOR PAM. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THERE'S A FIRST ALL I WANT TO I THINK MY GOOD FRIEND FROM BERKELEY HER WORDS ABOUT SOME ISSUES THAT COME UP COMMITTEE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT BUT STILL REALLY IS ABOUT IS BEING SURE OF THAT- PEOPLE WHO- BEEN FROM THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. THREE WE GET TAKEN THAT CAN. ISN'T AS PART OF BEING ABLE TO. REHABILITATE SOMEONE BE SURE THAT CAN NOW CONTRIBUTE TO OUR SOCIETY. AND TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN DOING SO CERTAINLY I AM VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND TERMS OF WHAT IT'S TRYING TO ACHIEVE. I'VE AND IT THANK THE OP FOR ACTUALLY A GAUGE IN THE STATE PROCESS BECAUSE I THINK IT WAS A CONCERN THAT. THERE ARE CERTAIN- EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES IN WHICH YOU HAVE TO BE IN SETTINGS WHERE- FOR VARIOUS REASONS- THOSE PARTICULAR SETTINGS ARE NOT IN A CONDITIONAL. SETTING LIKE CLASSROOMS BUT IN THE HEALTH. CLINIC THINGS WHERE SOMETIMES SOME OF THESE. ISSUES DO COME UP AND WE WON'T BE SURE PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO COME THE PRO. IT COMES UP. COMPLETE THEIR EDUCATIONAL SO THAT THE AUTHORS S. IS THAT A DRY THIS IS AND I KNOW THAT AS THIS GOES I LOOK FOR TO SEE WHAT COMES OUT OF STATE CALL PROCESS BY SURLY URGENT AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL SO THIS BILL K. THE MOVE FOR THEM AGAIN OPPORTUNITIES EVERYONE YOUR JOB THANK PANS PORTIS. THANK YOU. I TO A CAN OF THE SENATE BERKELEY IN FOR HAVING HIS OF TO COMMENTS AND RECOMMEND IN THE- I THINK YOU HAVE A WRECKED FOR THAT IT'S EARNED. WHEN I THIS BIKE. US THAT THERE COULD A SECOND SIDE TO THIS POINT WHERE YOU WANT TO LOOK UPON THE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AS A WAY UP FOR THESE PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS WHO MAY HAVE HAD SOME CRIMINAL HISTORY. THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT COIN. MY CONCERN IS THAT YOU MIGHT ALSO BE CREATING CHALLENGES FOR THE SCHOOL OR THE UNIVERSITY. THAT IS WELCOMING THESE INDIVIDUALS IN. THROUGH ITS BLIND PROCESS. THEY THEMSELVES COULD BE EXPOSING THEMSELVES TO- THE PROSPECT OF- CIVIL LIABILITY FOR ANY POTENTIAL MISDEEDS THAT THEY MAKE. COUNTER FOR EXAMPLE SOME OF THE HISTORY OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE WE TALKED ABOUT THE SEXUAL ARE ART HISTORY AS WELL YOU'RE WORKING RIGHT NOW. MY CONCERN IS THAT WE NEED TO PROBABLY CONSIDERED TAX THE HAS TO ORIGIN FIRST. WELL AS THE DIGITAL ARE GOING TO THESE. SETTINGS DO THEY NOT HAVE A RIGHT TO STORE THEM WITHIN TO. NOT WHO ARE MINOR BUT THOSE EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE A HUSBAND A FATHER A MOTHER A WIFE WOULD WANT O KNOW THAT DAY OR X. BEING EXPOSED- INTO A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SITUATION THAT'S ISSUE NUMBER ONE ISSUE NUMBER TWO IS THE IDEA THE UNIVERSITY. IN THE STUDENT AND IF THEY HAVEN'T EXTENSIVE ENOUGH CRIMINAL HISTORY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FOR EXAMPLE GO TO LAW SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PASSED THE CARE FITNESS ROOM. SO THEY MAY BE WAY INTENTIONED AND IN FOR THE STUDENT THAT THE% COULD CREATE PROBLEMS DE THE ROAD. IN WHICH CASE- THE UNIVERSITY BE GLAD TO TAKE THEIR TUITION DOLLARS BUT THEY MAY HAVE A ZERO CHANCE OF PASSING THE CHARACTER FITNESS. ARE OUT FOR A RESPECTED PROFESSION OTHER BE LEGAL OR MEDICAL OR OTHERWISE SO. I AM I'M SORRY I KEEP FORTY ON A UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES BUT I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU WOULD ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND MADE COULD SUPPORT IN THE NEXT GO AROUND AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY THANK YOU. YOU CENTER BOARD SENATOR. HOPE YOU PUT YOU DOWN GOOD MEMBERS FURTHER. OR DEBATE. THIRTY BEEN A WOULD YOU LIKE TO CALL. THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE RAISED IN THE DISCUSS WAS REYES WERE THE ONE WAS EXACT IN THE NAY OF THAT WHICH BOTH TO A THE COMMITTEE. AND BROUGHT UP TO ME AS I TALKED TO MEMBERS AND SO THAT IS WHY MY STAFF IS ALREADY INITIATED A STAKEHOLDER MEETING WITH COLLEGES INCLUDING PROPERTY COLLEGES TO DISCUSS THOSE VERY ISSUES AND- WHEN I. HOPE THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD AND I HOPE THAT ARE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS GETS. IT RIGHT WHEN WE BRING IT BACK TO. WITH THAT I ASKED A VOTE THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER. MA'AM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

SENATE BILL THREE SEVENTY EIGHT BY SENATOR WIENER AN ACT RELATING TO ELECTRICITY. SENATOR WIENER. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT ON A COLLEGE GIVEN THE RECENT SURGE IN THE NUMBER OF PLANNED BLACKOUTS- AN IMMENSE DESTRUCTION THAT THEY HAVE CAUSED BY SENATE BILL THREE SEVENTY EIGHT- AIMS TO ENSURE- THAT ARE LARGE UNTIL IT HE'S USING BLACKOUTS ONLY WHEN THEY ARE TRULY NECESSARY. AS AN OPTION OF LAST RESORT THAT THEY ARE USED AS A SCALPEL BUT AS A SLEDGE HAMMER. AS YOU MAY HAVE SEEN I PUT THIS LINE WE'RE STILL IN THE PRINT LAST SEPTEMBER. TO THE INTENT PLACE OF WOULD BE THERE IF YOU. GET SIGNIFICANT FOR WE CAME BACK IN THE SESSION. AND WE RECEIVED A LOT OF FEEDBACK IN THE MIDDLE OF CHANGES TO THE BILL. WE ALSO MADE SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS- THAT WE TALK AS RECOMMENDED BY THE ENERGY COMMITTEE- TO SCALE THE BILL BACK WE'RE HAPPY TO DO THAT. WE KNOW THE BILL'S WORK IN PROGRESS AND WE WILL. TO WORK WITH STAKE. IN THE GOVERNOR AND THE OPPONENTS OF THE BELT AS WELL AS A SUPPORTERS AS WE MOVE THROUGH THIS. YEAR WHAT WILL SURELY BE A SIGNIFICANT YEAR FOR ENERGY. ABOUT SB THREE SEVENTY EIGHT IS A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO TRY AND GRAPPLE WITH THE VERY VERY NEGATIVE IT ACTS OF THESE BLACKOUTS ON THE FOR CALIFORNIA. ON THE PROBLEM OF COURSE IS MOST ACUTE IN THE GT TERRITORY WHAT WE HAD ONE BLOCK OUT THAT AFFECTED TWO POINT FIVE. MILLION BUT WE KNOW THAT IT'S AN ISSUE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AS WELL. GOING TO BE VERY CLEAR THIS IS NOT ABOUT OPPOSING THE USE OF BLACKOUTS TO AVOID WILDFIRES BLACKOUTS CAN BE A POWERFUL TOOL TO REDUCE WILDFIRES. THIS IS ABOUT ENSURING THAT THESE BLACKOUTS ARE NOT BROADER AND LONGER. THAN THEY NEED TO BE AS A MATTER OF PUBLIC SAFETY. RIGHT NOW AND THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM. INSIDE THE UTILITIES HAVE NO INCENTIVE HAVE NO OBLIGATION. TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE HARM. TO PEOPLE. BETTER CALL IS CAUSED BY THE BLACKOUTS. THEY DON'T HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHEN PEOPL LOSE MEDICINE OR LOSE THE CONTENTS OF THE REFRIGERATOR. THEY DON'T TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHEN THE SMALL BUSINESSES FORCED TO CLOSE AND MAYBE GOES OUT OF BUSINESS. IN ORDER TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE LOST WAGES THAT SOMEONE SUFFERS BECAUSE THEIR EMPLOYER HAD TO CLOSE DOWN. OR BECAUSE THEY HAD TO STAY HOME BECAUSE OUR KIDS SCHOOL HASBEEN SHUT DOWN AS A RESULT. OF THE BLACKOUT. HI HE THREE SEVENTY EIGHTHS- WILL ALLOW PEOPLE TO SEE COMPENSATION FOR DAMAGES- THROUGH THE CPU CITY IN THE CITY YOU SEE WHAT FLEXIBILITY. SET UP PROCESS MEN ARE WHAT KIND OF DAMAGES SHOULD BE A RECOVERABLE. IN ADDITION IF THE CPUC THE TERM AND- THE TOP BLOCK OUT. ON REASONABLE. IF WELL AT LEAST. FAR BUT NOT IF IT'S THE TO BE RES. THE BILL WILL NOT ALLOW THE UTILITIES TO CHARGE PEOPLE FOR A LACTIC SERVICE DURING BLACKOUT PERIODS AND YES. PEOPLE GET CHARGE FOR SERVICE DURING PERIODS WHEN THEY HAVE NO SERVICE- SO COLLEAGUES THIS IS I THINK A GOOD FAITH. A STEP FORWARD TO GET A HANDLE ON THESE BLACKOUTS IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE THE WILD WEST ALL RIGHT NOW AND REAL PEOPLE ARE BEING HARMED- LIKE I SAID. WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS- AS WE INDICATED IN THE ENERGY COMMITTEE. TWELVE DAYS AGO- AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE COMING MONTHS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS IS GOOD A BILL- AS POSSIBLE THING OBSERVERS SUPPORT RESPECT ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER WIENER MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SENATOR PORTIS. THANK YOU. I HAD A DISTRICT TOUR- DURING THE BREAK IN WILD FIRE THE WILD FIRE PRONE AREAS OF MY DISTRICT AND I HEARD LENTY OF EXAMPLES OF ODD DURING THE BLACKOUT- FOR EXAMPLE SMALL MOM AND POP RESTAURANT DIDN'T HAVE A GENERATOR AND LOST ALL THE SUPPLIES THAT HAD IT FOR THE RESTAURANT ALMOST PUT BUSINESS OUT OF BUSINESS. I THINK THERE ARE NUMBER OF IT SINCE WERE WE SEE BLACKOUTS AND NATURALLY BEGS THE QUESTION WERE THE PUBLIC SAFETY RELATED BLACKOUTS OR ARE THERE OTHER FORCES AT PLAY SO MY- I AM A GREAT AMOUNT OF EMPATHY FOR THE DESIRE OF THIS LEGISLATION MY CONCERN IS WHETHER OR NOT GOOD POLICY IS BEING PUT FORWARD OR IF YOU COULD BE MADE BETTER. I REFER TO 12-1 ELEVEN POINT FIVE AND IS IN TURN KIND OF MUSEUM HARPER. IF THE ISSUE BERMAN. THE DEAL. CORPORATE FAIL TO ACT IN A READ. IN PRUDENT MANNER. IN ITS SIMPLE. AND EXIT. OF THE JEEP THE D. STATION EVENTS. WHEN I WHEN I HEAR REASONABLE AND PRUDENT HI QUESTION ARE WE ARE WE WERE IN SACRAMENTO RIGHT. SO I GUESS MY QUESTION TO YOU IS I DON'T THINK I CAN THE POSITION TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT TODAY KNOWING THAT THE P. YOU SEE IS GOING THROUGH. A REVIEW PROCESS. AND I'M- AS DOES THERE'S A TIME LINE ON THIS YOU NEED TO GET OVER TO THE ASSEMBLY LIKELY BRING IT BACK IN THE PROCESS. NGUYEN THE P. YOU SEE DOES COMPLETED MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT WILL BE. INCORPORATED INTO THIS LEGISLATION. SO NOW IT- MEMBERS AND IF I MAY POSE A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR. FOR THAT VERY PURPOSE. SENATOR WIENER WE TAKE A QUESTION. PLEASE THAT SEAT IN THAT THERE'D BE EXACTLY AT ARE YOU ANTICIPATING THAT WHEN THE P. YOU SEE HAS ITS FRAMEWORK PUT FORWARD. WITH MORE PARTICULARITY ON THE CRITERIA USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER A- PROVIDER ACTED REASONABLY IMPRUDENT THAT YOU WILL INCORPORATE THAT INTO THIS LEGISLATION IS THAT YOUR ANTICIPATION. YES REASONABLE AND PRUDENT IS AN EXISTING STANDARD TO SEE IF YOU SEE AND THE CITY YOU SEE IS AS YOU KNOW GOING THROUGH A BUT THROUGH THE PRESIDENT OF COURSE. IS GOING THROUGH A PROCEEDING TO SPECIFICALLY DEFINE WHAT REASONABLE AND PRUDENT MEANS IN A BLOCK ALL CONTACTS- AND WE ON AND DOT DOT WILL BE WHAT THE BILL RELIES ON. AND I AND IF I MAY KNOW SPECIFIC TO THAT ASKER'S- DISTRICT I'VE NEGLECTED TO MENTION BEFORE- THAT THE ROLE COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA RC RC SUPPORTS THIS BILL. AND THE FARM BUREAU HAS NOT YET TAKEN ITS OFFICIAL POSITION BUT HAS ENCOURAGED. THAT THE BILL MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU SENATOR BORDERS SENATOR WILK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS AYE RICE'S CO AUTHOR OF SB THREE SEVENTY EIGHT AN URGENT WE NEED A BILL THAT WILL HELP DIMINISH THE IMPACT OF MASS BLACKOUTS FROM PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF OTHERWISE KNOWN AS P. S. P. S. WHICH HAD BEEN INFLICTED UPON OUR COMMUNITIES. WE LEARNED LAST FALL THAT OUR INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES ARE NOT AS PREPARED AS THEY SHOULD BE TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE. BRING ONE OF THESE P. S. P. S. ADVANCE A WHEELCHAIR BOUND. EIGHTY TWO YEAR OLD VETERAN. WHO NEED A RELIABLE SOURCE ELECTRICITY TO POWER HIS GENERATOR FOR HIS OXYGEN. CALLED HIS LOCAL UTILITY. AND THEIR ADVICE. DIAL NINE ONE ONE. UPON HEARING THAT SOME WOMEN LACKEY AND MYSELF PERSONALLY DELIVERED AND SET UP A GENERATOR- THAT THE VETERAN USE FOR THE FOLLOWING FIVE DAYS. THIS IS SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE. MASSIVE WILDFIRES ARE HORRIFIC ENOUGH WITHOUT THE ADDED BURDEN AND NO ELECTRICITY IF YOU LIVE IN A RURAL AREA THIS MAY MEAN NO PHONES OR NO WATER FOR UP TO SEVERAL DAYS. MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS THEY DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS IS PS PS THEY BELIEVE THAT IS P. S. B. S. AND I BELIEVE SB THREE SEVENTY EIGHT IS A REMEDY THAT WILL HELP PROTECT CONSUMERS AND WHOLE DIO USE ACCOUNTABLE. AND AS THE AUTHOR SAID THIS IS THIS BILL ISN'T IS NOT COMPLETED BUT WE NEED TO MOVE IT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR TO BRING ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TO. TOGETHER AGAIN A PROTECT CONSUMERS AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. HANK YOU CENTER WILK SENATOR RUBIO. MADAM PRESIDENT. OF FIRST I JUST WANTED TO STATE FOR THE RECORD YOU KNOW I HAD CONVERSATONS WITH THE AUTHOR AND I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT WE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE THAT'S BEEN AFFECTING SO MANY OF OUR RESIDENTS. ARE WE WERE ABLE TO HEAR TESTIMONY FROM AN INDIVIDUAL WHO LOST EVERYTHING AND SHE WAS HELPING HER NEIGHBORS AND SO WE RECOGNIZE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. TO MOVE FORWARD IN A WAY THAT WE CAN ALL THESE ISSUES FOR THE FUTURE HOWEVER I STILL HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT I NEED TO. EXPRESS UP CHIN FOR THE- WE IN OUR QUEST. THANK YOU PLEASE FIRST. AS IT'S WRITTEN NOW ARE THE HEAD OF FINES EVERY HOUR ON THE HOUR STILL PART OF THE BILL. I'M SORRY WE FIND SECOND HERE. YOU QUIT ALTES YEAH YES SO THAT WILL BE AMENDED DOT PROVISION IN THE ENERGY COMMITTEE WERE ACCEPTED THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS- WE CUT OF THE HOURLY FEES IN HALF- AND THEY ONLY APPLY IT SEE IF YOU SEE HAS THE TURN OF THE BLACKOUT. WAS ON REASONABLE SO AFTER THE FACT- DOING INVESTIGATION MAKE A DETERMINATION IF IT WAS A REASONABLE BLACKOUT. THEN THE FEES DON'T APPLY TO HOURLY FINES IF YOU DON'T APPLY IT WAS ON REASONABLE THEY APPLIED BUT THEY WERE CUT IN HALF BY THE COMMITTEE AND I WAS HAPPY TO ACCEPT THAT AMANDA. THANK YOU FOR THAT. I'M STILL BASED ON YOUR STATEMENT I JUST WANT TO EXPRESS ONE OF THE THINGS I REALLY SUCH A STRUGGLE WITH IS. WHEN WE IMPOSE YOU KNOW ALREADY PENALTIES AND FINES MY CONCERN IS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SAVE LIVES. AND THESE PENALTIES MAY CAUSE SOME OF THE UTILITY COMPANIES TEND TO HESITATE TO BLINK. WHEN IT COMES TO THE LIVES OF INDIVIDUALS WE DON'T WANT THEM TO TAKE THAT SHORT CUT. AND SO THAT IS A BIG CONCERN STILL OF MINE THAT DAVE THEY'RE TRYING TO. MEET THE RESTORATION UNDER THAT OUR JUST TO AVOID A FINE THAT THAT POSES FOR ME THAT'S A CONCERN WE WANT THE UTILITY COMPANIES TO TAKE THEIR TIME MAKE SURE THAT THEY DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO. TO ENSURE THAT THE LINES ARE CLEAR AND THEIR PEOPLE ARE SAFE. SO I DID MOVE THE THAT THE BILL FORD BUT I WILL CONTINUE TO EXPRESS THAT THERE'S A LOT THINGS TO. FIX AND THIS BILL AND I HOPE THAT YOU CONTINUE TO WORK. BOB SURE THAT WERE. DENTAL USING YOUR OR AT LEAST. IN THE UTILITY COMPANY TO. THE PICKUP. AND NOT BE SEEN. WITH WHAT THEY'RE- IN AND SO WITH THAT. I ASK THAT YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- WE ALL SHARE THOSE ISSUES THAT TOOK PLACE WITH THESE YES YES SHUTDOWNS- I GOT A PHONE CALL FROM THE CITY MANAGER OF ATTACHED BE AN ENTIRE CITY OF JUST UNDER A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE. AND P. JEANNIE YEARS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SINCE. THE WHICH I SHOULD MENTION THAT I APOLOGIZE. JUST HIT THE WRONG LINE AND IT TOOK HIM A COUPLE OF DAYS TO GET THAT. POWER BACK ON WE HAD HOSPITAL'S SCRAMBLING WE HAD A WATER TREATMENT FACILITY. SO I UNDERSTAND THE PAIN THAT IS GOING ON I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT WOULD INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE AFFECTED AND THAT HAD ISSUES WITH. BEING SHUT OFF WHETHER THEY WERE ON OXYGEN OR HAD NO. ABILITY FOR MOBILITY AND SO THERE ARE HUGE- HUGE ISSUES WITH THESE SHUT OFF SEIZE POWER THAT OFFICE. IS IF YOU'RE NOT PREPARED ARE YOU NOTED. SO I'M VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THAT POINT- WE YOU KNOW OUR PURPLE RESIDENTS WAS AFFECTED AT ONE TIME. AND I DON'T AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT JUST BECAUSE OF ME I'M JUST SAYING THAT I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO. AND HOLD UTILITY. ACCOUNTABLE BUT WE- TO LOOK AT THE BRIGHT PIT- OF. THE NO THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION IN ARE GOING TO TAKE PLACE THIS YEAR SPECIFICALLY AROUND OUR LARGE UTILITY HOLDERS. AND% THESE ISSUES THAT WE'RE FACING. YOU KNOW THESE WILDFIRES AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID RE. SUBSTANTIAL AND CREATE- DEATH IN SOME CASES IN FULL LOSING EVERYTHING. IF THESE UTILITIES ARE GONNA BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE AT. AND THEN BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AS TWELVE FOR ME THE GAME DâN. THAT WORD FROM S. WHILE. I THINK THERE HAVE A GIVE. WE THOUGHT WHAT'S GOOD BURKE ASIDE. WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S- TO THAT WE ELIMINATE MASSIVE. HERE'S MY SAG AND YOU GET A LINE BREAKAGE THAT CREATE. A SOME OF THE WILDFIRES. BUT WE ALL HAVE TO LOOK AT VEGETA MANAGE AND A LOT OF THINGS. THE NEED TO TAKE PLACE IN ORDER AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND THAT NEED TO TAKE PLACE IN ORDER THAT WE HAVE SUSTAINABLE ELECTRICITY. THAT GOES AND WE DON'T END UP LIKE A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY I MEAN WE'RE CALIFORNIA IN THE TWENTIETH TWENTY TWENTY IN IN TWENTY TWENTY. AND WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A VIABLE SOLUTION FOR POWER MOVING FORWARD. AND I THINK THAT WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT HOLDING THEM ACCOUNTABLE IN ONE PLACE BUT NOT ALLOWED TO EXT EYES AT. THE IN S. IT IS TO BE CALM. ON THE MINUTES. YOUR BILL DAY BUT I WANT YOU TO REALLY FOCUS ON. ARE TURNING IN THE CAUCUS BASICALLY THE REASON SALUTE YOU KNOW THE RE. LANGUAGE THAT'S WHAT'S REASONABLE. NO THE PEOPLE OF DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WHAT REASONABLE IS SO WE SHOULD DEFINITELY. HONE DOWN THAT LANGUAGE WHEN YOU GET IT OUT OF THIS FLOOR AND MOVE OVER TO THE ASSEMBLY. BECAUSE I REALIZE THAT SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE AND I HAVE A LOT OF ANGRY CONSTITUENTS AS WELL. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT. LIKE I SAID. YOU KNOW WERE IT'S ALMOST AS IF WE'RE REQUIRING SOMEBODY TO DO SOMETHING AND NOT GIVING THEM THE ABILITY TO DO. IN ORDER TO. IMPACT THE KEY ISSUE IS WE SET. ASK YOU TO WORK AT MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD. THANK YOU. DOLLY THE MATTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS I DO WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I'M GONNA LAY OFF THE BILL TODAY AND REASON I ONE OF THE OFFICE I THINK THAT. THE FOCUS OF THIS BILL IS ON THE UTILITY IN THE FOCUS I THINK IN MY MIND. WOULD BE THE P. YOU SEE. THEYHAVE FAILED US. TREMENDOUSLY FAILED US. WE AUTHORIZED THEM AND I DON'T WANT TO GO OUT AND- MAKE SURE THE LINES WERE SECURED AND THAT THEY HAD. PROGRESS MOVING FORWARD. THEY DIDN'T EVEN FOLLOW UP AND CHECK UP THEY DID ABOUT 5% OF THE WORK. THAT NEEDED TO BE DONE THE LAST YEAR AND WE'RE NOW GOING TO. RUN A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT. THAT IS LOOKING AT CREATING MORE RATE PAYER THERE'S THIS IS GONNA BE POSITIONS. FOR THE P. YOU SEE ACTUALLY ANALYZE THIS BILL AND COME UP WITH IT WHETHER IT WAS. JUSTIFIED OR NOT. WE'RE GONNA AUTHORIZED MORE POSITIONS WE NEED TO. PURSUE ANALYZE THE- AGENCY THAT IS. TO REGULATE THE UTILITIES WHICH IS THE P. YOU SEE. AND IN THE- EIGHT YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE WHETHER IT'S WILD FIRE WHETHER IT'S OUR PS. THE P. YOU SEE TAKES A STAND BACK AS IS ALL THE LEGISLATURE NEED TO TELL TO DO THAT WE TOLD THEM TO DO SOMETHING. IN SB NINE A ONE AND A FAILED US. HEARD LOUD YEAR KNOWING FOR THE TIME THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE THESE. HIGH WINDS THAT YES WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. MAKE SURE THAT UTILITIES INCLUDING CELL TOWERS IN THOSE YES THEY REPORTED BACK TO THEM AND WHAT DID WE GET. WE GOT POWER OUTAGE WE GOT CELL SERVICE OUTAGE FOR DAYS ON END. SO I THINK THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THE P. YOU SEE. THEY ARE FAILING US HORRIBLY THEY'RE APPOINTED BODY. THEY ARE NOT DOING WHAT THEY NEED TO BUT WE NEED TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE BEFORE WE GO GIVING THEM MORE DISCRETION TO HIRE MORE PEOPLE TO REGULATE UTILITIES WE NEED A MICRO WORKS NEED TO BE ABLE TO SHUT DOWN OUR SYSTEM IN SMALL AREAS NOT GIANTS WALLACE I WAS FACED WITH THE SAME THINGS MY COLLEAGUES IN MANY OF YOU TALKED ABOUT TODAY WHERE I HAD BUSINESSES LOSE LILY HUNDREDS OF THOUSAND DOLLARS ALMOST PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS AND THEY'RE GONNA GET COMPENSATED. TO LEARN FIFTY. THE A DAY CANDIDATES RIDICULOUS. SO I'M REALLY OFF YOUR BILL I'M GONNA SEE WHAT COMES BACK FROM THE ASSEMBLY BUT I WOULD ENCOURAGE THIS BODY TAKE A REALLY GOOD LOOK AT THE P. YOU SEE AND WHAT THEIR POWERS ARE AND HOW THEY USE THEM AND NOT USE THEM TO THEIR FAVOR VERY DISCOURAGED WITH THEM I THINK WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB TO SERVE OUR CONSTITUENTS IT.

CALLING MEMBERS ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SEEING AND HEARING NONE SENATOR WINNER PLEASE CLOSE.

IS NOT- YEARS NEVER ENERGY IN CALIFORNIA'S NEVER CLEAR CUT- AND WE'RE TRYING TO GET THROUGH IT THE BEST WE CAN BUT WHAT WE KNOW. WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT THESE BLACK OUTS JUST LIKE THE WILD FIRES ARE EXTREMELY HARMFUL HARMFUL THE BLACKOUTS ARE HARMFUL. AS WELL. AND THIS IS NOT ABOUT- ABOUT. SAYING NO WILD FIRES THIS IS ABOUT HAVING A STRIKING A BALANCE. AND RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO BALANCE RIGHT NOW ALL THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR THE UTILITIES ARE ALL ON THE SIDE OF BROADER. AND LONGER BLACKOUTS YES THEY LOSE SOME MONEY- BUT THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES ARE STRONGLY ON THE SIDE OF GOING LONGER AND BROADER BLACKOUTS. WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO BRING IN ALL THE WAY TO THE OTHER SIDE WE'RE WE SO YOU'LL NEVER DO IT. BY HANCE TO TAKE A MORE BALANCED APPROACH- AND WE ABSOLUTELY- WILL BE WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS JUST LIKE WE HAVE BEEN WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT INTENSIVELY- AND NO THIS BILL WALKING.

AND IT WAS THERE THAT I MET HIM FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME I BELIEVE IT WAS A SECOND YEAR. WITH THE LAKERS AND IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE FORM. IT WAS THE FORM CLUB THAT YOU WANT TO BE SEEING OR BE SEEING SEE AND I'M CLUB EITHER. BEFORE THE GAME AT HALFTIME OR AFTER THE GAME BECAUSE YOU KNEW ATHLETES AND CELEBRITIES WOULD COME INTO THE FORM CLUB. BUT CALL WASN'T OLD ENOUGH TO GO IN THE FORM CLUB.

FOR pTHEY ALWAYS HAD A BIG- AMAZING SPREAD OF FOOD AND PRETZELS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE SO WE WALKED IN THERE THAT NIGHT AFTER THE GAME THE HANG OUT WITH MY FRIENDS SON AND- WHO WALKS IN.

ADVANCED DEGREES IN COLLEGE BUT THE INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS WORRIEDLY AS PRESENCE AND MATURE BEYOND ALL A BEYOND HIS AGE.

THE MOM BUT I'M GOING TO CHOOSE TO SPEND MY TIME. TO TALK ABOUT KOBE BRYANT. BECAUSE AT THIS TIME IN OUR COUNTRY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. POLITICALLY SOCIALLY ECONOMICALLY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE. BUT WHILE HIS ATHLETIC ACCU MEN WAS INDEED EXCEPTIONAL. COLBY THE MAN WAS NOT. BECAUSE HE DID WHAT IS AND WAS EXPECTED. HE DEAR WHAT COUNTLESS OTHER BLACK MEN ACROSS THIS COUNTRY DO EVERY DAY. HE WAS PASSIONATE ABOUT JUSTICE HE SUPPORTED THE EXPANSION OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNDERSERVED PEOPLE. HE WAS A GENEROUS PHILANTHROPISTS. HE WAS A DEVOTED FATHER. A FATHER LIKE MANY OTHER FATHERS WHO GAVE HIS BABY NICKNAMES THE MAMBA CETUS. A FATHER WHO COACHED HIS BABY'S BASKETBALL TEAM. WE WATCHED HIM GROW UP LITERALLY AT FEET INTO THE NBA AT SEVENTEEN IN THE PUBLIC EYE NOT SOMETHING THAT'S VERY EASY TO DO.

WE ARE SUFFERING A VERY SHOCKING AND HEART WRENCHING LOSS. I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES BUT HE WAS MUCH MUCH MARCH MORE. THEN THE ATHLETE THE GREAT ATHLETES BUT FOR THE RECORD. FIVE TIME NBA WORLD CHAMPION. EIGHTEEN TIME NBA ALL STAR. HIS ENTIRE TWENTY YEAR NBA CAREER WAS WITH THE LOS ANGELES LAKERS. IN ALL OF HIS THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS. BECAUSE OF ALL OF HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS TO JERSEYS WERE RETIRED IN HIS NAME. ANY REACHED AN EIGHTY ONE POINT GAME. YES COLBY MEANT SO MUCH MORE THAN HIS ACCOLADES AND STATISTICS. HIS TALENT AND HIS COMMITMENT TO HIS CRAFT MADE THE WORD COLBY SYNONYMOUS WITH GREATNESS. HE INSPIRED A GENERATION OF BOYS AND GIRLS NOT ONLY TO COMPETE AND ATHLETICS BUT ALSO TO STRIVE WITH ALL OF YOUR EFFORT IN EVERY ASPECT OF YOUR LIFE TO IMPROVE TO SUCCEED. AND STARTING WITH HIS OWN FAMILY. YOU'VE ALL HEARD AND READ ABOUT THE STORIES OF HIS DAUGHTER GIGI. THERE WAS A STORY THAT I READ ABOUT SOMEONE COMING UP TO COLBY I THINK IT WAS WHEN HE WAS RETIRING AND SAID. YOU GOTTA HAVE A SON KERRY ON YOUR LEGACY AND HIS DAUGHTER WAS STANDING RIGHT THERE AND HE LOOKED BETTER AND SHE SAID I GOT A DAD. SHE WAS GOING TO CARRY ON THAT LEGACY. CODE B. SPIRIT LIVES ON EVERY TIME WE SEE THE NUMBERS EIGHT AND TWENTY FOUR HANGING IN THE RAFTERS OF STAPLES CENTER IN EVERY TIME A CHILD YELLS COLBY. WHEN ATTEMPTING A SHOT WHETHER THEY'RE USING A BASKETBALL OR ROLLED UP SOCK. HE WAS NOT PERFECT NO HUMAN BEING IS BUT HE TAUGHT US NEVER TO GIVE UP HE SHOWED US THAT WITH DEDICATION AND DISCIPLINE ONE COULD ALWAYS BECOME. AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID A BETTER VERSION OF WHAT THEY ARE. THE WORLD WILL FEEL THE PAIN OF THEIR LOSS FOR SOME TIME. ONLY FOUR YEARS SINCE KOBE'S RETIREMENT HE AND HIS DAUGHTER HAD ONLY JUST STARTED. THIS NEXT CHAPTER OF THEIR LIVES. HE WAS A ROLE MODEL ON MANY LEVELS. HE DID THINGS NOT TO BE POLITICALLY CORRECT HE JUST DID THINGS BECAUSE HE WAS A DECENT HUMAN BEING. TO HELP AND LOVE OTHERS WITH NO DISTINCTION. SPOKE ITALIAN VERY PROUDLY TO LEARN SPANISH. WHICH ENDEARED HIM TO THE LATINO COMMUNITY AND HE WAS PROUD TO TALK ABOUT BEING MARRIED TO A MEXICAN WOMAN AND THAT HIS CHILDREN WERE MEXICAN. AND I UNDERSTAND HE WAS BEGINNING TO LEARN TO SPEAK MANDARIN. I MET HIM WHEN I WAS A MEMBER OF THE UNITED WAY BOARD OF DIRECTORS HE AGREED TO BE THE SPOKESPERSON FOR THE HALLMARK. TO BRING CONSCIOUSNESS TO THE CRISIS OF HOMELESSNESS MIND YOU THAT WAS SEVERAL YEARS AGO. WHEN IT HAD NOT GOTTEN AS BAD AS IT IS TODAY WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT IT HE PERSONALLY GOT INVOLVED BECAUSE OF HIS DEEP CONCERN FOR HUMANITY. HE PERSONALLY WAS AT ALL OF THE KICK OFF FOR THE WHOLE MARK. HE DONATED TO THE AFRICAN AMERICAN SMITHSONIAN HE CARED A LOT ABOUT KIDS WITH THE BOYS AND GIRLS CLUBS AND OTHER YOUTH PROGRAMS HE READ TO KIDS TO THE COMMUNITY COALITION PROGRAMS. HE HAS BEEN A HERO TO MY SON MICHAEL HIS WHOLE LIFE. MICHAEL IS AN ADMIRERS NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF HIS EXTRAORDINARY SKILLS. AND TO BE PROUD TO SAY WAS A LAKER. BECAUSE YOUR- COLBY WAS SO DETERMINED THAT'S WHY MICHAEL WOULD SAY AND SAID TO ME HE WANTED TO GROW UP AND BE LIKE KOBE. MAY HE REST IN PEACE ALONGSIDE HIS DAUGHTER AND FRIENDS WHO DIED WITH HIM. MAY GOD STRENGTHEN HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTERS AND ALL THE FAMILIES WHO LOST A LOVED ONE DURING WHAT WILL SURELY BE A VERY PAINFUL TIME. THANK YOU.
