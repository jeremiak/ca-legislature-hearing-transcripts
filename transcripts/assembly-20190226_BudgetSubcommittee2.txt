AGAIN OUT OF ALL TEN RECAP AT WELCOME TODAY'S THAT'S INFORMATIONAL HEARING WITH THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON ON EDUCATION FINANCE IN THE ASSEMBLY HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE. THIS HEARING IS ON REFORMING OUR COLLEGE FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE WORLD CLASS CAL GRANT PROGRAM WHICH IS. PHENOMENAL EFFORT TO PAY FOR TUITION FOR LOWER INCOME. FAMILIES A CALIFORNIA GO TO COLLEGE BUT WE KNOW THE COST OF COLLEGE IS MUCH MORE THAN TUITION TODAY. ITS HOUSING UNITS BOOKS IN TRANSPORTATION AND FOOD AND WE'RE SQUEEZING OUT. THOUSANDS OF THE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WHO WHO NEED A COLLEGE EDUCATION AND THEIR AVERAGE DEBT NOW IS NORTH OF TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND SO ONE THING THAT WE WANT TO LOOK AT TODAY IS HOW CAN WE MODERNIZE AND RE VAMP ARE CAL GRANT. PROGRAM THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM AND SERVE -- MORE STUDENTS WHO JUST MISS OUT WHO JUST WHO JUST LOOK OUTSIDE THE CRACKS. BUT ALSO LOOK AT THIS NOTION OF DEATH TALK ABOUT FREE COLLEGE THAT WE THINK THAT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON DEBT FREE COLLEGE STUDENTS AND PARENTS HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO STEP UP A LITTLE BIT AS MUCH AS THEY CAN AFFORD. BUT STUDENTS SHOULD NOT BE SADDLED WITH -- TWENTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN DEBT AND AN IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO MOVE ON WITH THEIR LIVES AND A COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY IS A KEY ISSUE WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE NEED TO GET MORE PEOPLE IN COLLEGE WE HAVE OTHER HEARINGS ABOUT. THE DEGREE GAP WE NEED TO MILLION MORE COLLEGE GRADUATES. CALIFORNIA'S WE NEED TO GET PEOPLE OFF OF THE SIDELINES IT INTO INTO COLLEGE YOU KNOW SPECIALLY WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS -- THE LACK OF FINANCIAL. FOR THAT THE NON TUITION COSTS HE KEEPS THEM ON THE SIDELINES AND THE PEOPLE THAT ARE -- BEING DENIED ARE THE SAME STUDENTS WERE TRYING TO GET IN HIGHER EDUCATION THE FIRST IN THE FIRST PLACE SO. WITH A LOT OF WORK IN THIS LAST COUPLE YEARS AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT SOME POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS TO INCLUDE. IN THE BUDGET AS WELL AS LEGISLATION AND SO LOOK FORWARD TO TODAY'S HERE MISTER MEDINA. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY -- IS GREAT TO SEE SO MANY STUDENTS AND STAKEHOLDERS HERE THIS MORNING -- AS I SAID AT A PRESS CONFERENCE WERE. ON THE STEPS OF THE WE'VE HEARD THE VOICES OF THE STUDENTS AND THE LAST YEAR. THAT. ARE STUDENT AID -- AS IT IS SET UP NOW DOES NOT MEET AS SENATOR AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY. AS STATED THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS TO GO TO COLLEGE AS WE TALK ABOUT THE GAP. THE GAP THE EDUCATIONAL GAP CERTAINLY MY AREA OF THE INLAND EMPIRE. THE THE AREA OF THE STATE WITH THE BIGGEST -- ACHIEVEMENT GAP WITH THE BIGGEST WITH THE LOWEST COLLEGE GOING RATE SO WE WANT. TO TODAY BEGAN. TO TAKE AWAY AND COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS WE'VE HEARD THE PROBLEMS OVER THE LAST YEAR. A WEEK WE UNDERSTAND THE ISSUES AND TODAY AS WE COME INTO THIS HEARING WE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU. OF WHAT WE CAN DO. WHAT WHAT SOLUTIONS THERE ARE TO THE PROBLEMS TO FIX? AN OVERLY COMPLEX -- SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE NOW WE CERTAINLY WANT TO HAVE ONE THAT THAT MEETS THE STUDENTS NEEDS AND IS AT THE SAME TIME -- I HOPE MORE USER FRIENDLY MORE STUDENT FRIENDLY. SO AGAIN WE'RE WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE SHORT COMINGS FORWARD TO THE PANELISTS. AND THE PRESENTERS TO OFFER SOLUTIONS. THAT WE CAN USE THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY AND I CAN USE AN A. B. THIRTEEN FOURTEEN THE CAL GRANT REFORM BILL OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND I LOOK. TO OTHER MEMBERS. ON THE DÃ­AS IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. ALL RIGHT WITH THAT WE WILL WE WILL START TODAY'S HEARING WILL BRING UP THE FIRST PANEL. FOCUSED ON MOVING BEYOND THE CURRENT CAL GRANT MODEL WE HAVE THE STATE COMMISSION THE CENTURY FOUNDATION. AND TAKE AS THE INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS. JOINING US TODAY [inaudible] YES. I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN HERE FOR THE LAST. THREE YEARS RIGHT SO WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE. SO HOPEFULLY WE'RE GOING TO PUT IT ALL TOGETHER AND NICE PACKAGE TO TO MOVE FORWARD SO WE'RE GONNA START WITH OUR CALIFORNIA REPRESENTED FOR THE STUDENT COMMISSION. MISTER DAVID ALBRIGHT. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CHAIRS AND MEMBERS I'M DAVID O'BRIEN DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT A COMMISSION. I WANT TO FIRST THANK YOU FOR INVITING US TO PARTICIPATE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE COMMISSION. WHICH SERVES OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIA STUDENTS I'M HONORED TO BE HERE TO DISCUSS -- HOW ARE FINANCIALLY TO SOME CAN BE REFORMED AND MODERNIZED TO BEST MEET THE NEEDS OF TODAY'S STUDENTS -- I DO WANT TO START BY -- ECHOING -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARTES COMMENT ABOUT -- FINDING. I CAN TELL YOU FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT IT IS I'VE BEEN TO MULTI STATE CONFERENCES AND THANKS TO THE LONG STANDING COMMITMENT OF LEGISLATIVE LEADERS SUCH AS YOURSELVES. CALIFORNIA DOES ENJOY -- WHAT BY ALMOST ANY MEASURE COULD BE CALLED THE MOST GENEROUS AND PROGRESSIVE STATE FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY -- IN PARTICULAR BY PROTECTING THE GUARANTEES OF THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM THROUGH MULTIPLE ECONOMIC RECESSIONS AND BUDGET SHORTFALLS. THIS LEGISLATURE HAS MADE CLEAR THAT SUPPORTING STUDENTS IS ONE OF THE STATE'S TOP PRIORITIES. BUT AS YOU WILL HEAR FROM MYSELF AND MOST OF THE PANELS HERE TODAY -- ARE FINANCIALLY SYSTEM DOES STILL HAVE QUITE A WAYS TO GO BEFORE WE CAN MEET THE GOAL OF MAKING A HIGHER EDUCATION ACCESSIBLE FOR ALL CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS. THIS NOVEMBER WORKING FROM THE REPORT THAT THE CENTURY FOUNDATION PREPARED ON OUR BEHALF AND IN RESPONSE TO A REQUEST FROM THE LEGISLATURE THE STUDENT A COMMISSION ADOPTED A SERIES OF FOUR PRINCIPLES THAT WE HOPE WILL SERVICE GUIDEPOSTS FOR THIS FINANCIALLY REFORM DISCUSSION. IN ADOPTING THESE PRINCIPLES THE COMMISSION RECOGNIZE THE VARYING PRIORITIES OF THE DIVERSE GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM TODAY. THE HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS IN INSTITUTIONS RESEARCH AND ADVOCACY GROUPS SUCH AS THE INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. WE HOPE THAT THESE PRINCIPLES WILL HELP BOTH THE LEGISLATURE THE ADMINISTRATION AS WE CONSIDER WHAT A BROAD OVERHAUL OF OUR FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM COULD LOOK LIKE. SO THE FIRST PRINCIPLE ARE COMMISSION ADOPTED WAS TO REMOVE OR REDUCE ELIGIBILITY BARRIERS TO THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM. AS YOU KNOW CAL GRANT IS AVAILABLE AS AN ENTITLEMENT TO STUDENTS WHO RECENTLY GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL OR WHO TRANSFER FROM A COMMUNITY COLLEGE BEFORE TURNING AGE. TWENTY EIGHT HOWEVER CALIFORNIA NOW HAS MORE STUDENTS THAN EVER FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS ATTENDING COLLEGE A LITTLE BIT LATER IN LIFE. SIMILARLY WE HAVE A GREAT NUMBER OF TRANSFER STUDENTS WHO ARE OLDER THAN TWENTY EIGHT INCLUDING ADULT LEARNERS LOOKING TO ACQUIRE NEW SKILLS OR KNOWLEDGE IN AN EVER CHANGING ECONOMY. FOR THESE STUDENTS THE CAL GRANT IS NOT AVAILABLE AS AN ENTITLEMENT THEY HAVE TO APPLY FOR ONE OF JUST UNDER TWENTY SIX THOUSAND AVAILABLE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT AWARDS. FROM A POOL OF OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS SO THAT' MORE THAN A QUARTER OF A MILLION STUDENTS WHO HAVE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL NEED. AND QUALIFY FOR CAL GRANT THAT AREN'T BEING SERVED BY THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM. AS PART OF REMOVING BARRIERS TO PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO CONSIDER WE CONSIDER THE REQUIREMENT THAT YOU CAN BE A RECENT HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE IN ORDER TO RECEIVE AN ENTITLEMENT CAL GRANT. DOES THIS TIME LIMIT ADEQUATELY SERVE THE STUDENTS OF TODAY MANY OF WHOM HAVE VALID REASONS FOR TAKING A BIT LONGER AFTER HIGH SCHOOL TO BEGIN COLLEGE. ON THAT SAME NOTE THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER AND I KNOW THERE'S BEEN LEGISLATION INTRODUCED UP ON THIS FRONT RAISING OR REPEALING THE AGE LIMIT ON THE TRANSFER ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS SO THAT TRANSFER STUDENTS. CAN RECEIVE AN ENTITLEMENT NO MATTER THEIR AGE. THE COMMISSION SECOND GUIDING PRINCIPLE FOR FINANCIALLY TO FORM IS AS ASSEMBLYMEMBERS MCCARTY MEDINA REFERENCED CONSIDERING THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE STUDENTS FACE. AS YOU'RE OF COURSE AWARE THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS LARGELY GEARED TOWARDS HELPING STUDENTS AFFORD TUITION WHICH IS REALLY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT COSTS FOR TYPICAL STUDENT. JUST TO GIVE. ONE EXAMPLE THAT'S NOT PURELY HYPOTHETICAL IN A LITTLE BIT PARTS OF THE SACRAMENTO STATE MYSELF BUT FOR A STUDENT ATTENDING SACRAMENTO STATE THAT CAN EXPECT TO PAY A LITTLE BIT OVER SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TUITION AND FEES. BUT WHEN YOU ADD BOOKS AND SUPPLIES ROOM AND BOARD TRANSPORTATION AND OTHER ESSENTIAL COSTS THE TYPICAL FULL TIME STUDENT LIVING ON THEIR OWN GOING TO SACRAMENTO STATE WOLD SEE A TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE. EASILY EXCEEDING TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS STUDENTS CAN RECEIVE CAL GRANT AID TO HELP WITH THESE NOT TUITION COSTS IN THE FORM OF OUR CAL GRANT BE ACCESS AWARD. WITHOUT A WORD IS LESS THAN SEVENTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS PER YEAR AND HAS NOT KEPT PACE WITH INFLATION SINCE IT WAS FIRST ENACTED IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES. IF IT HAD IT WOULD BE WORTH MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS TODAY. SO WHILE THE COMMISSION HAS NOT ENDORSED A SPECIFIC APPROACH FOR ADDRESSING THIS PRINCIPLE THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER AND THERE'S BEEN LEGISLATION AGAIN INTRODUCED ON THIS FRONT AS WELL. A NEW MODEL FOR THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM THAT SEEKS TO HELP STUDENTS OF FOR THEIR TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE. SO THIS MIGHT ENTAIL OVERHAULING THE PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS TOTAL AID PACKAGE WHICH INCLUDES FEDERAL AID ANY AMOUNT THE STUDENTS PARENTS OR FAMILY CAN CONTRIBUTE AND SOME REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF EITHER LOANS ARE WORKING COME ON THE STUDENTS BEHALF. IS SUFFICIENT TO A FOR THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE. THE COMMISSION'S FINAL TO PRINCIPLES RELATE TO SPECIFIC COMPONENTS OF THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM THAT A STATE FINANCIAL AID LEADERS WE ARE PRIORITIZED. THE FIRST HAS TO DO WITH CAL GRANTS FOR STUDENTS ATTENDING PRIVATE NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS SO PRIVATE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ARE CRUCIAL TO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY AND OUR HIGHER EDUCATION ECOSYSTEM AS WE LIKE TO CALL IT SOMETIMES. SCHOOLS IN THE ASSOCIATION OF INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES EDUCATE OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS INCLUDING NEARLY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND UNDERGRADUATES EVERY YEAR. HOWEVER THESE STUDENTS CAL GRANT AWARDS ARE NOT LINKED TO TUITION BUTTER INSTEAD SAID A FLAT RATE CURRENTLY A LITTLE OVER NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR FOR A FULL TIME STUDENT. ON FORTY THIS AWARD HAS NEVER BEEN INCREASED AND HAS EVEN BEEN REDUCED ONCE ALREADY -- AND IS THUS LOST A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ITS VALUE IN RECENT YEARS MAKING IT EVER MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE STUDENTS TO A FOR THEIR EDUCATION. TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS ARE ALL SEGMENTS OF HIGHER EDUCATION HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY THE STUDENT A COMMISSION HAS ADOPTED THE PRINCIPLE THAT REFORMING OUR STATE FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM. SHOULD INCLUDE RESTORING AN ANNUAL JUST INSTITUTIONS SO THAT THAT AWARD -- EITHER INCREASES OR AT LEAST NO NO NO LONGER DECLINED IN VALUE YEAR OVER YEAR. FINALLY THE COMMISSION HAS ENDORSED THE PRINCIPLE THAT STUDENTS TAKING SUMMER COURSE WORK SHOULD NOT BE PENALIZED BY HAVING THEIR CAL GRANT ELIGIBILITY REDUCED. ANOTHER ISSUE ON WHICH OUR STUDENT LEADERS HAVE THAT IN PARTICULAR -- TAKEN LEAD AND FOR INTRODUCING LEGISLATION ON THIS FRONT ALREADY. CURRENTLY STUDENTS OF YEARS THE CAL GRANT AWARD DURING THE SUMMER OR REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF ELIGIBILITY THEY WILL HAVE LATER ON AND MAY ACTUALLY RUN OUT OF CAL GRANT ELIGIBILITY ENTIRELY BEFORE THEY'VE COMPLETED THEIR SENIOR YEAR. MANY STUDENTS NEED TO TAKE SUMMER COURSES IN ORDER TO GRADUATE IN A TIMELY MANNER AND AVOID HAVING TO COME BACK FOR A FIFTH OR SIXTH YEAR. SO THESE ARE THE PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL AID REFORM THE THROUGH NAY COMMISSION HAS ADOPTED -- I WOULD JUST LIKE TO CLOSE BY POINTING OUT THAT AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA REFERENCED THE COMMISSION IS A VERY MUCH AWARE HOW COMPLEX OUR STATE FINANCIALLY SYSTEM IS. AND TO THAT END WE ARE OPTIMISTIC THAT WORKING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS -- OUR PARTNERS AND STUDENTS THE LEGISLATURE THE MINISTRATION CAN ENACT A COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL AID OVERHAUL BUT SIMPLIFIES AND STREAMLINES THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM FOR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES WELL SEEKING TO BETTER DRESS THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE. SO THAT EVERY CALIFORNIA STUDENT HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE THE DREAM OF HIGHER EDUCATION. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HAVING HERE TODAY AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU NEXT WE'RE GONNA HAVE BOB SORRY MAN THE SENIOR FELLOW WITH THE CENTURY FOUNDATION. CHAIRMAN MCCARTY AT GERMAN MEDINA MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND SUBCOMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INVITING THE CENTURY FOUNDATION TO PRESENT SOLUTIONS TODAY -- I'M ROBERT SHERMAN DIRECTOR OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION PROGRAM AT CENTURY. AS MISTER O'BRIEN INDICATED LAST YEAR FOR USE FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM UNDER CONTRACT FOR THE STATE NAY COMMISSION WE FOUND A SYSTEM THAT DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB COMPARED TO OTHER STATES. BUT WE ALSO SAW ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO DO BETTER. AFTER OUR SIXTIES CONTRACT ENDED AS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION COMMITTED TO REDUCING INEQUALITY WE DECIDED TO INDEPENDENTLY CONSIDER CONTINUE THE WORK THAT WE HAD BEGUN. I'D LIKE TO START BY TELLING YOU ABOUT A NEW STUDY THAT CAME OUT IN DECEMBER THAT -- IN BEYOND THE TIMELINE OF OUR OUR REPORT THIS WAS WHAT IS KNOWN AS A RANDOMIZED TRIAL OR THE GOLD STANDARD OF OF SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH THESE TYPES OF STUDIES. ARE SO RIGOROUS THAT THEY FREQUENTLY FIND ONLY SMALL IMPACTS FROM THE INTERVENTIONS THAT THEY TEST TEST IF ANY IMPACTS AT ALL. THIS RESEARCH THOUGH FOUND VERY LARGE EFFECTS INDICATING THAT THE INTERVENTION HAD A LOT OF POWER TO AFFECT THE BEHAVIOR OF LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND STUDENTS. HERE'S WHAT THEY DID. THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN SENT LETTERS TO LOW INCOME HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO ACCORDING TO THE HIGH SCHOOL RECORDS WOULD LIKELY QUALIFY FOR ADMISSION BUT THIS WAS WELL BEFORE THE TIMELINE FOR ACTUALLY APPLYING. AS PART OF THIS LETTER THEY TOLD THE STUDENTS THAT IF THEY WERE ACCEPTED THEY WOULD BE GUARANTEED A FULL TUITION SCHOLARSHIP. COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP THESE LOW INCOME STUDENTS WHO GOT THE TUITION SCHOLARSHIP MESSAGE WERE MORE THAN TWICE AS LIKELY TO APPLY TO THE UNIVERSITY AND TWICE AS LIKELY TO ENROLL. THAT IS A VERY LARGE AFFECT FOR A STUDY LIKE THIS THE KICKER ON THIS STORY IS THAT THE FINANCIAL AID FUNDING WAS ACTUALLY NO DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE TREATMENT GROUP. AND THE AND THE CONTROL GROUP BUT IT WAS FAR MORE EFFECTIVE FOR THE TREATMENT GROUP LIKELY FOR TWO REASONS. ONE IS THAT IT WAS PERSONALIZED IT WAS SPECIFIC TO THE STUDENT RATHER THAN THE GENERAL STATEMENTS THAT WE USUALLY MAKE ABOUT FINANCIAL AID. ALSO IT WAS VERY GEN IS TOTALLY COVERED AND PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT TUITION. NOW THOSE OF US IN THIS HEARING KNOW THAT THE COLLEGE COSTS THAT ARE THE BIGGEST BARRIERS TO CALIFORNIA'S LOW INCOME STUDENTS ACTUALLY SUCCEEDING IN COLLEGE ARE FREQUENTLY NOT JUST THOSE TUITION COSTS BUT INSTEAD. OTHER EXPENSES AND WE MUST NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THAT WHILE WE ALSO AT THE SAME TIME RECOGNIZE THAT WE NEED THAT THAT A WAY OF HOOKING STUDENTS IS TO LET THEM KNOW THAT THEIR TO THAT TUITION ITSELF. IS NOT A PROBLEM. SO -- THAT POWERFUL MOTIVATOR FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES IS CRITICAL AND IT'S THE MOST POWERFUL WHEN IT IS DELIVERED IN A TARGETED WAY WHICH IS COMPLETELY CONSISTENT WITH A NEED BASED SYSTEM THAT CALIFORNIA HAS. THAT'S WHY WHAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING IS EIGHT TUITION PLUS APPROACH TO REFORMING CAL GRANTS IT WOULD HAVE TO PARTS THAT CONTINUE TO BE BASED ON NEED. A CAL GRANT TUITION SCHOLARSHIP AND CAL GRANT PLUS SCHOLARSHIPS. THE CAL GRANT TUITION SCHOLARSHIPS WOULD BE LIKE THE CAL GRANTS WE HAVE NOW BUT WITH EXPANDED ELIGIBILITY THAT ELIMINATES THE GPA TIME OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND AGE RESTRICTIONS. THE PROGRAM SHOULD BE DESIGNED TO INCORPORATE THOSE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE ELIGIBLE INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE GETTING PARTIAL TUITION COVERAGE AND OF THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM. IN ADDITION STUDENTS WHO QUALIFY BASED ON NEED WOULD GET CAL GRANT PLUS SCHOLARSHIPS TO ADDRESS REMAINING GAPS AFTER CONSIDERING A FAMILIES EFC TELL GRANTS AND A WORK EXPECTATION. WELL THE TUITION SCHOLARSHIP PROVIDED BY C. SACK WOULD BE AT A FIXED LEVEL. THE CAL GRANT PLUS SCHOLARSHIP WOULD BE MORE IN THE HANDS OF THE SEGMENTS AND THE CAMPUSES TO MAKE FINAL ALLOCATIONS BASED ON LOCAL AND STUDENTS SPECIFIC FACTORS. THE FUND IN FOR THESE SCHOLARSHIPS WOULD COME FROM A COMBINATION OF EXISTING INSTITUTIONAL A DOLLARS AND NEW STATE PROVIDED RESOURCES. WE LAY OUT MORE DETAILS ABOUT THIS OF THIS APPROACH AND THREE BRIEFS ON OUR WEBSITE AND ATTACHED TO MY WRITTEN TO MATT TESTIMONY TODAY. DISCUSSING HOW TOTAL COSTS SHOULD BE ESTIMATED HOW THE EFC CAN BE SET AND HOW FUNDS WOULD BE ALLOCATED TO COLLEGES AND TO STUDENTS IN A TUITION PLUS CAL GRANT SYSTEM. LAST FALL IN A LETTER TO SEE SEC CHANCELLOR WHITE AND PRESIDENT A POLITICIAN NOW IT CSU AND AND UC LAID OUT AN IMPORTANT SET OF PRINCIPLES THAT ARE WORTH CONSIDERING. ONE WAS BUILT ON SUCCESS AND DO NO FAULT DO NO HARM WE AGREE WHICH IS WHY OUR PROPOSALS BUILD ON CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT CAL GRANT SYSTEM. SECOND MAINTAIN CAL GRANTS CORE FOCUS ON TUITION COVERAGE WE AGREE THAT'S THE REASON FAR RECOMMENDATION FOR A CAL GRANT TUITION SCHOLARSHIP AND CAL GRANT PLUS SCHOLARSHIP FOR THE OTHER EXPENSES. THIRD EXPAND THE REACH OF CAL GRANTS ELIMINATING THAT GPA AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS WOULD ACCOMPLISH EXACTLY THAT. SUMMER PAL IS ONE OF THEIR PRINCIPLES WE PROBABLY AN AREA THAT DOES MAKE SENSE TO ADDRESS. AND FIFTH THEY SAID MAINTAIN THE CAMPUS FOCUS ON THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE. THAT IS A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT GOAL AND WHERE -- BUT IT BUT MORE FUNDING IS NEEDED TO ACHIEVE THAT ESPECIALLY AT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THAT IS THE GOAL OF THE CAL GRANT PLUS COMPONENT OF OUR RECOMMENDATION WHICH WOULD FUND OF THAT ADDITIONAL SUPPORT WHILE MAINTAINING. THE CAMPUS LEVEL DISCRETION TO DEPART FROM C. SACK FORMULAS THAT MIGHT BE ADOPTED AT A STATEWIDE LEVEL. WE APPRECIATE HE TIME AND ATTENTION THAT THE COMMITTEE AND SUBCOMMITTEE ARE PUTTING INTO THE ISSUE OF COLLEGE ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. I'LL HAVE SOME FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS FOR YOU IN A SEC -- NOW RUNNING GO TO DEBBIE COCHRAN WITH THE INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS TO GET. THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIR MCCARTY INTERMENT ENOUGH I'M MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM SO APPRECIATIVE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE WITH YOU BUT ALSO FOR YOUR INTEREST AND DEEP INTEREST IN THIS TOPIC -- I'M DEBBIE COCHRAN EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS FOR TO GUESS -- YOU FOR OVER A DECADE ART ANALYSES HAVE SHOWN THAT DESPITE DESPITE THE STATE'S FOCUS ON KEEPING IN TUITION LOW AT PUBLIC COLLEGES AND HAVING FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS. THAT COULD EASILY COVER TUITION -- THERE ARE REASONS TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT COLLEGE -- FOR WITHOUT BELIEVER IN ALL THE POINTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY MICHAEL PANELISTS ALREADY -- YOU KNOW BECAUSE THE CALL TOTAL COSTS OF COLLEGE INCLUDES A WHOLE RANGE OF COSTS BEYOND TUITION BOOKS AND SUPPLIES TEXTBOOKS. TRANSPORTATION REMEMBER WARD -- BUT OUR AID POLICIES REMAIN SKEWED TOWARDS TUITION COSTS -- AND THIS IS LEAD TO FAR LESS SUPPORT FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS AT LOWER TUITION COLLEGES AND FAR LESS SUPPORT MEANS PART GREAT GREATER AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES -- ACROSS ALL PUBLIC COLLEGES IN CALIFORNIA OUR RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT STUDENTS FROM FAMILIES WITH THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A FAMILY INCOME ARE LAST. IN HOUSEHOLD INCOME HAVE TO SPEND ABOUT HALF OR MORE OF THEIR TOTAL FAMILY INCOME JUST TO PAY FOR COLLEGE COSTS AFTER ALL GRANTED IS ALREADY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT -- THIS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THIS GROUP THIS THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OF FAMILY INCOME UNLESS GROUP. INCLUDES MORE THAN HALF OF LATINO STUDENTS THREE AND FIVE NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS AND NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF BLACK STUDENTS. SAID THIS IS THIS IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THESE UNTENABLE COLLEGE COSTS ARE NOT JUST CONTRIBUTING TO THE STATE'S COMPLETION CHALLENGES BUT ALSO THE EQUITY GAPS THAT WE SEE. IN WHO GETS TO AND THROUGH COLLEGE AND WE ALSO SEE THAT AMONGST THOSE WHO DO COMPLETE IT'S THE LOWER INCOME STUDENTS UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS WHO ARE MORE LIKELY TO GRADUATE WITH BURDENSOME AT THE WE SEE THESE TRENDS. BECAUSE TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE BEING LEFT OUT OF STATE. THAT'S WHY WE AS IN OTHER ORGANIZATIONS HAVE FOR YEARS SUPPORTED COLLEEN'S CALLS FOR INCREASES THE NUMBER OF CAL GRANTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN INCREASES TO THE CAL GRANT THAT COVERS NON TUITION COSTS. OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS WE'VE ALSO JOINED THE CALLS TO ENCOURAGE THE STATE TO THINK BIGGER I'M BEYOND WHAT LEVEL OF INCREMENTAL INCREASE THE STATE CAN MAKE IN ANY GIVEN YEAR. AND INSTEAD TO FOCUS ON WHAT STUDENTS NEED. AT THIS POINT WE FEEL LIKE THERE IS AN EMERGING CONSENSUS ON WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE I'M EVEN WHILE DIFFERENCES ON HOW TO GET THERE REMAIN. IN BRIEF THAT CONSENSUS IS THAT THE STATE SHOULD TAKES TO STUDENTS TOTAL COSTS OF COLLEGE INTO ACCOUNT RATHER THAN JUST THEIR TUITION COSTS. AND EXPECT THAT STUDENTS AND FAMILIES CAN CONTRIBUTE -- WHAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S REASONABLE GIVEN THEIR OWN FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES THE REST WOULD BE COVERED BY FINANCIAL AID FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID COLLEGE FINANCIALLY AND STATE FINANCIAL AID. ON THIS IS AN APPROACH SUGGESTED BY T. BECAUSE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN BY THE LA -- IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN BY THE CENTURY FOUNDATIONS TO NAY COMMISSION AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND IT'S REFLECTED IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES PROPOSE FREE MARKET INTRODUCED BY SENATOR LEVI. TWENTY NINETEEN WE BELIEVE THAT THIS FRAMEWORK SHOULD SERVE AS A NORTH STAR FOR THE STATE AS IT FIGURES OUT HOW TO SORT THROUGH IMPORTANT POLICY QUESTIONS THAT NEED FURTHER ATTENTION. SOME OF THE SAME TYPES OF QUESTIONS THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN MENTIONED. I'M IN OCTOBER WE HOSTED A CONFERENCE TO BEGIN EXPLORING SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS AND WE COMMISSION SEVERAL PAPERS DESIGNED TO MOVE THE CONVERSATION FORWARD. WE PUBLISH A COMPENDIUM OF THOSE PAPERS WHICH YOU SHOULD HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU. I'M EARLIER THIS MONTH WE KICKED OFF A WORKING GROUP AIMED AT BETTER UNDERSTANDING IN ARTICULATING AREAS OF AGREEMENT AND DISAGREEMENT ON SOME OF THESE POLICY DETAILS TO INFORM THE STATEWIDE DEBATES. TO PRINT THE INSTANCE IN OUR FIRST MEETING ARE WE DISCUSSED HOW TO DEAL WITH WIDELY DIVERGENT ESTIMATES OF WHAT COLLEGE COSTS WITHIN A PARTICULAR REGION THINK TWO SIDE BY SIDE. SCHOOLS THAT HAVE VERY DIFFERENT ESTIMATES OF WHAT HOUSING SHOULD COST FOR INSTANCE AND THERE'S JUST SOME GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT GREATER STATE INVOLVEMENT IN THESE ESTIMATES SETTING INCH WOULD BE WARRANTED. I'M WE ALSO I'D HAD DISCUSSED THE IDEA OF MAKING REACH C. CALC CALCULATION -- THIS IS THE EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION CALCULATION FOR CALIFORNIA STATE AID. I'M WANTED GROUP GENERALLY AGREE THAT ESE WAS NOT PERFECT AND THERE WERE SOME REASONS TO CONSIDER REGIONAL ADJUSTMENTS THERE WERE ALSO SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE COMPLEXITY OF ADDINGA SECOND STATE SPECIFIC CALCULATION. AND A GENERAL RECOGNITION THAT LOW INCOME STUDENTS WOULD BE UNLIKELY TO BENEFIT FROM SUCH AN ADJUSTMENT -- BUT THERE ARE OTHER QUESTIONS THAT ALSO WEREN'T GREATER ATTENTION AND THEY'VE GOTTEN TO DATE AND WE INTEND TO EXPLORE THEM WITH OUR WORKING GROUP IN SUBSEQUENT MEETINGS SO SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS ARE -- YOU KNOW ELIMINATING ALL STUDENT ELIGIBILITY BARRIERS MAY NOT BE FEASIBLE. SO WHICH ONES ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE AND HOW DO WE ORDER THEM. ARE THEIR REFORMS THAT THE COLLEGES THEMSELVES NEED TO PURSUE TO MAXIMIZE THE IMPACT OF NEW INVESTMENTS. HOW SHOULD THE STATE BE THINKING ABOUT PRIVATE COLLEGES WHICH AS MISTER BRIAN MENTIONED ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT PART OF THE CALIFORNIA HIGHER EDUCATION LANDSCAPE BUT DON'T NECESSARILY FIT WELL INTO A TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE MODEL? ALSO HOW SHOULD LARGE SCALE REFORMS BE PHASED IN TO ENSURE THAT THEIR OPERATIONALLY FEASIBLE AND THAT THE MOST UNDERSERVED STUDENTS ARE PRIORITIZE AT EACH STEP. WE SEE THAT THESE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THAT WARRANT SOME FOCUS. AND YET IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT THE STATE CANNOT WAIT UNTIL ALL THE WE HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS -- TO ACT. CURRENTLY FEWER THAN HALF OF STUDENTS TO APPLY FOR CAL GRANTS AND MEET THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA RECEIVE GRANTS AND MOST WHO ARE TURNED AWAY HAVEN'T EFC AND EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION OF ZERO EVEN THOSE HE GETS GRANTS COVER JUST STRUGGLE TO COVER THEIR COSTS. I'M IN THAT LETTER FROM YOU SEE PRESENT ALL THE TIME AND CSU CHANCELLOR. WHITE THAT MISTER SIMON REFERENCED -- THOSE LEADERS POINTED TO THE NEED HOW GRANT ELIGIBILITY BEARS AN INCREASE THE CAL GRANT BE ACCESS AWARD IN THOSE ARE IN LINE WITH RECOMMENDATIONS WE'VE MADE. THE CALIFORNIANS FOR CALL OF COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY OF MADE AND THE CALIFORNIA HIGHER EDUCATION BASIC NEEDS ALLIANCE HAVE MADE. MAKING A SIZEABLE DOWN PAYMENT TOWARDS THESE ENDS THIS YEAR WITH THE TIMELINE FOR ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN FUTURE YEARS. IS THE LEAST OF THE STATE CAN DEAR WHAT TO CAPITALIZE ON THE MOMENTUM AND RELATIVE CONSENSUS ON A POLICY ISSUE. THAT'S SO CRITICAL TO THE STATE'S FUTURE. NOT BROADER REFORM IS ABSOLUTELY WARRANTED -- BUT AT A TIME WHEN THERE'S SO MUCH AGREEMENT ON WHAT OUR NORTH STAR SHOULD BE THE WORST OUTCOME AT THIS POINT WOULD BE FOR THE STATE TO FAIL TO MAKE PROGRESS TOWARDS IT. BECAUSE WE SPENT SO MUCH TIME STUDYING THE ROADMAP. SO WHETHER THROUGH BROADENING THE REGION SCOPE OF CAL GRANTS UNDER THE PROGRAM'S CURRENT STRUCTURE OR SORTING OUT THE DETAILS OF WHAT A NEW STRUCTURE COULD LOOK LIKE THE STATE CANNOT AFFORD TO WAIT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU -- NOW ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS I DID WANT TO RECOGNIZE OUR DOUBLE COMMITTEE HERE FROM THE HIRED COMMITTEE WE HAVE SOMEONE MEMBERS. GABRIEL -- DOCTOR CHOICE MEMBER BLOOM AND MISTER LEVINE AND THEN FROM OUR BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE WE HAVE ASSEMBLYMEMBERS MARTUCCI LÃ  MON AND GALLAGHER SO WELCOME EVERYBODY THIS MORNING -- QUESTIONS FOR THIS PANEL. ALL START OUT THEN. YEAH. I WANT TO JUST YOU YOU ALL KIND OF PLENTY OF REMEDIES THAT WE COULD FOCUS ON THE GAPS OF STUDENTS TONIGHT I THINK THIS IS AMAZING JUST TO POINT OUT AGAIN. THE PEOPLE GET LOST TO FIND A WE DO HAVE THIS AMAZING CAL GRANT PROGRAM. WE DO HAVE -- THESE ELIGIBILITY LIMITS AND SO YOU COULD BE A STUDENT WHO MAKES FIFTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS YOUR FAMILY AND HAS A GPA. OF TWO POINT NINE AND YOU WOULD GET NO CAL GRANT AID FOR YOU CAN MAKE A THOUSAND DOLLARS LESS THAN A GPA OF TWO POINT. FOUR AND GET THAT THEY KEPT THE CAL GRANT BE AWARD AND SO WE JUST HAVE THIS. WITH THE CALL THE DONUT HOLE WHATEVER THESE THESE GAPS OF PEOPLE ARE JUST MISSING OUT -- THEN WE HAVE STUDENTS WHO GRADUATE JUST A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF DEBT. AND WE HAVE CITIES DON'T GET ON ALL BECAUSE THE COMPETITIVE PIECES SO I GUESS MY POINT IS AS WE HAVE ALL OF THESE. PIECES THAT WE CAN TACKLE WE JUST WE WE HAVE A NICE ROAD MAP. BUT I THINK IT'S UP TO US TO OUR BUDGET COMMITTEE PROCESS IS SOMEWHAT PRIORITIZE. AND SO WE DON'T HAVE UNLIMITED RESOURCES. MAYBE ASK THE PANEL WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE THE MOST -- APPROPRIATE PLACES TO START NOT JUST THE LOW HANGING FRUIT AS FAR AS COST. BUT YOU KNOW ANY OF THE GLASS -- PROBLEMS THAT WE SHOULD BE ADDRESSING RIGHT AWAY. SO WHOEVER WANTS TO BEGIN. I'M OF START THANK YOU -- FOR STARTING OUT WITH AN EASY QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER. CHRISSY ABOUT -- ONE FROM THE STUDENT AID COMMISSIONS PERSPECTIVE I THINK THAT IF THE STATE WERE TO START OUT BY PUTTING WILL -- WHAT I BELIEVE THE ADMINISTRATION IT'S BECAUSE LIKE TO CALL A DOWN PAYMENT? ON SOME SORT OF OVER ARCHING FINANCIALLY -- FORM I THINK. IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO FIND A BALANCE BETWEEN. SORT OF THE WHAT WE INTERNALLY CALL THE DEPTH VERSES BREATH CONVERSATION OR YOU KNOW MAY BOTH ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THERE ARE. A LOT OF STUDENTS THAT ARE LEFT OUT OF THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM BECAUSE WE DON'T GET ANY COVER AND IT ALL BECAUSE THE ELIGIBILITY BEARS THAT ARE IN PLACE. BUT ALSO THAT THERE ARE QUITE A LOT OF STUDENTS IN THE PROGRAM THAT DON'T GET ENOUGH AID WHETHER IT'S THROUGH THE CAL GRANT BE ACCESS WERE NOT HAVING GONE UP -- OR YOU KNOW OR OTHER PLACES LIKE THE THE SO SO CALLED DOUGHNUT HOLE THAT YOU MENTIONED. SO I THINK THAT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WITHOUT SORT OF SAYING ONE POLICY ONE BILLS BETTER THAN THE OTHER I THINK. WE WOULD JUST -- TO LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS TO CONSIDER THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF STUDENTS IN BOTH GROUPS IT'S IT'S WE WOULD SAY IT'S PROBABLY NOT ENOUGH TO JUST EXPAND ELIGIBILITY AND GET MORE STUDENTS IN THE PROGRAM. BUT IT'S ALSO NOT ENOUGH TO JUST INCREASE THE OUR PROGRAM BECAUSE THAT STILL IS A LOT OF STUDENTS LEFT OUT SO SOME TYPE OF BALANCED APPROACH IN THAT COULD BE -- IT'S NOT A SYSTEMIC REFORM THAT COULD BE FOR EXAMPLE INCREASING THE NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT AWARDS WHILE ALSO INCREASING THE CAL GRANT. BE ACCESS AWARD. THAT WOULD BE ONE APPROACH THAT WOULD BOTH DO BOTH OF THOSE THINGS AT ONCE BUT THAT DOESN'T GET TO THE SYSTEMIC ISSUES OF THE HEART THE PROGRAM THAT YOU REFERENCE AND THAT THE OTHER PAYMENTS OF REFERENCE SO -- THAT'S ALSO IMPORTANT -- YOU KNOW I THINK THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY NEEDS TO BE HEALTHY MORE STUDENTS GET FINANCIAL AID -- YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S A BUT THERE IS AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE THAT COMES ALONG SIDE OF THAT RECEIPT OF A GRANT AND WE CAN DO MORE TO CAPITALIZE ON THE MESSAGE THAT WE THAT WE SEND WHEN WE SEND A STUDENT AWARD LETTER SAYING THAT THEY GET A CAL GRANT. IN FACT SOME OF THE PAPERS -- IN THE COMPENDIUM THAT I SHARED WITH YOU -- TALK ABOUT WAYS THAT WE CAN IMPROVE THE COMMUNICATIONS OF CAL GRANT AND I THINK THERE'S REALLY THERE'S REAL GAINS WE COULD BE MAKING BY THINKING ABOUT THAT AND THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN REFERENCE. UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN -- RESEARCH EMPHASIZES THAT -- SO I THINK THAT THAT IS I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT THE MESSAGING PEACE BUT IT ALSO WE HAVE TO GET MORE STUDENTS INTO THE DOOR -- WE HAVE TO GET TWO MORE STUDENTS INTO THE DOOR WITH FINANCIAL AID -- THERE ARE SO MANY STUDENTS -- AT THE PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS AS WELL AS NONPROFIT THAT ARE BEING LEFT OUT CURRENTLY -- AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES -- YOU KNOW WHICH RECEIVE A VERY OF CAL GRANT SPENDING DESPITE AND ROLLING THE VAST MAJORITY OF UNDERGRADUATES IN THE STATE -- THERE'S ACTUALLY ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AS ADD ONS TO THE CAL GRANT RIGHT THERE'S THAT THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDED PROGRAMS THERE. AND SO THE MORE STUDENTS WE ACTUALLY GET IN THE DOOR WITH CAL GRANTS. THE MORE OPPORTUNITY THEY HAVE TO ALSO LEVERAGE THAT OTHER FINANCIAL AID SO I WOULD SAY THAT HAS TO BE A KEY PRIORITY BUT I WOULD ALSO ECHO THE COMMENTS ABOUT THE CAL GRANT THE AXIS AWARD -- NEEDING TO INCREASE AS WELL. DO YOU HAVE A THOUGHTLESSNESS RETIREMENT SURE. ODD SO I I'VE BIRD WATCHING THIS PROCESS AND BEING A PART OF THE LAST OF IT FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS I SEE KIND OF A MAYBE IT'S SORT OF A CHICKEN AND EGG KIND OF PROBLEM WHERE. WE CAN IMAGINE THESE GRAND REFORMS BUT THEY COST A LOT OF MONEY SO WE DON'T DO ANYTHING IMMEDIATELY -- YET THE THING WE CAN DO IMMEDIATELY IS IN THE BUDGET PROCESS PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO SOMETHING SO. I LIKE THE DIRECTION THAT THE COMMITTEES ARE GOING WHERE THE IDEA OF KIND OF LAYING OUT WHAT ARE ALL OF THE THINGS WE WANT TO DO OVER A FOUR YEAR FIVE YEAR PERIOD -- AND THEN IDENTIFYING THE STEPS TO GET THERE NOW FORTUNATELY WE HAVE. A GENERALLY GOOD STRUCTURE RIGHT NOW BUT WITH A LOT OF GAPS SO -- BEGINNING TO FILL ONE WITH SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS COMPLETELY CONSISTENT WITH A LONG TERM -- LARGER REFORM PLAN AND LAYING OUT THAT LONGER PLAN CAN MAKE IT CLEARER WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN NEXT YEAR AND THE YEAR AFTER THAT I THINK -- IS COCHRAN'S IDEA OF MORE MONEY IN THE COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM JUST GETTING MORE STUDENTS -- FUNDED -- WOULD BE AT UP THE GREAT WAY TO A GREAT WAY TO START -- YOU COULD ALSO LOOK AT HOW MUCH RESOURCES CAN WE AFFORD THIS YEAR TO ADD INTO THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM AND WHICH OF THE BARRIERS DOES THAT MAKE FOR A GOOD FIT. YOU KNOW IS THAT THE GPA IS THAT THE AGES IT TIME OUT OF SCHOOL IS IT SOMETHING ELSE -- SO I GET IT I I COULD SEE EITHER WAY BUT BUT EITHER WAY IT WOULD SEND IT WOULD. BE A START TOWARD FILLING THE GAPS OVERTIME AND ENDING UP WITH A DEBT FREE COLLEGE SYSTEM. SO A FOLLOW UP ON THAT I THINK I ASK MISS COCHRAN THIS QUESTION LAST YEAR AND AND YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT SO. LAST YEAR AGAIN SO THEN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HE HAS ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION -- TO EXPAND CAL GRANT A DIFFERENT IDEA THAT WE HAD BUT STILL NOT NOT A BAD ONE TO HELP BEING. COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO ARE PARENTS AND DOING A ADD ON TO THEIR CAL GRANT PLUS HOW YOU CALL IT -- IT SO IT IF IT GETS KIND THE ADAGE THAT YOU WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE MORE PEOPLE GETTING INTO COLLEGE GETTING SOME EIGHT OR HAVING. THOSE WHERE THEIR GRADUATE WITH LESS DEBT SO IF YOU HAD A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SUITCASE RIGHT HERE WOULD YOU RATHER HELP OUR CAL GRANT RECIPIENTS WITH THE WITH THE THE PLUS. WITHOUT YOU CALLED YEAH CAL GRANT PLOW GRANT PLUS OR GIVE MORE AWARDS TO THE PEOPLE IN THE DOUGHNUT HOLE OR THE COMPETITIVE WHO WHO ARE. GETTING A CHANCE RIGHT NOW. WHAT WOULD YOU DO? IF WE HAD A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS -- I ASSUME I'M NOT ALLOWED TO SPLIT THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS LIKE. FIFTY FIFTY OKAY I THINK I WOULD PROBABLY DO SOME SORT OF COMBINATION BUT I WOULD HAVE TO SAY IN TERMS OF THAT -- YOU KNOW WHEN WE LOOK AT WHERE STUDENTS ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND AND WHERE SOME OF THE GREATEST AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES OUR OUR RESEARCH CONSISTENTLY POINTS BACK TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS NOT TO SAY THAT THOSE ARE THE ONLY PROBLEMS BUT WE SEE SUBSTANTIAL PROBLEMS THERE AND I DO THINK THAT. THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDED FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN A BIT OF A GAME CHANGER IN TERMS OF THAT EQUATION -- RIGHT NOW STUDENTS WHO ARE ENROLLED IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES GETTING THE CAL GRANT AND YOU WERE TAKING FIFTEEN CREDITS A TERM. CAN GET QUITE A SIZEABLE BOOST IN THEIR CAL GRANT AWARD -- THAT'S GREAT BUT THAT'S YOUR ONE OR 2% OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS THE WAY WE NEED TO WE GETTING MORE OF THEM CAL GRANTS. I'M IN LARGE IN THE BASE THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE GRAMS AND THEN WE WILL HELP MORE STUDENTS THAT WAY A CHEF AND LAST BEFORE I MOVE ON TO MISTER MEDINA. ON ON THE IN THE AGENDA THINGS ON PAGE FIVE WERE. WE LAY OUT ALL OF THE FINANCIAL AID AND IT'S NOT INSIGNIFICANCE TEN BILLION DOLLARS GOES OUT. TO STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA EVERY YEAR. RENDON ENOUGH. 40% OURSELVES FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE PELL GRANT. WE DON'T ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THE UC AND CSU COMPONENTS AND THAT I ASSUME IS THAT THAT THAT TUITION THE THIRD THAT GOES BACK. TO RETURN TO AID. AND IT'S THEIR MONEY THEY THEY ADMINISTERED IT SEPARATE FROM OUR CALIFORNIA FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM THE TWO BILLION DOLLAR. PLUS PROGRAM AN ESTIMATE COMMISSION -- SHOULD WE BE THINKING OF THAT DIFFERENTLY AS IN PUT IT AGGREGATE ALL TOGETHER. ARE WE DOING THE **** COORDINATED I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW YOU SEE IS LIKE THE MODEL WHERE THEY THEY PACKAGE MONEY AND SOME OF THE MONEY A PACKAGE IS STUDENTS CAL GRANT MONEY BUT THAT MONEY TOO SO. I KNOW I'M NOT SURE IF WE'RE ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT THAT IN THE BIG PICTURE WHAT HE SAID. I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE COORDINATION BETWEEN THE FUNDING THAT CAL GRANT FUNDING AND THE THE INSTITUTIONAL AID THAT COME FROM AND AND YOU COULD EVEN THINK ABOUT THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED INCREASE -- THAT IF THE GOVERNOR'S FUNDS FOR STUDENTS PARENTS WHERE SOME OF THOSE STUDENTS THOSE STUDENT PARENTS AT UC AND CSU. ARE. ARE ARE OR WOULD BE CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE FOR SOME OF THE INSTITUTIONAL AID THAT THE INSTITUTIONS ARE PROVIDING AND SO IN A WAY THE LEGISLATURE IS WE'RE LEAVING. THE UNIVERSITIES OF SOME OF THAT BURDEN AND THAT CAN START THE CONVERSATION -- HOW DO WE DO A BETTER JOB OF SHARING DATA ABOUT WHERE THE NEEDS ARE AND HOW THEY ARE GETTING COVERED ONE WAY OR ANOTHER -- AND AND THAT'S THE KIND OF PARTNERSHIP WE WE NEED BETWEEN SAID NAY COMMISSION AND THE SYSTEMS SO THAT WERE THINKING. FULL COST OF ATTENDANCE AND ALSO ALL STUDENTS -- RATHER THAN AS KIND OF A LOW A LEVEL OF BLINDNESS NIGHT RIGHT NOW THAT THIS DID NAY COMMISSION HAS WHERE THEY FOR THE CAL GRANT MONEY OVER THERE FOR REALLY GOOD PURPOSES AND AND STUDENTS WHO. NEED IT BUT BUT THEN WHAT'S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING IS. A LOT OF IT IS AN UNKNOWN. DO YOU THINK IT SHOULD ALL BE UNDER ONE UMBRELLA I DON'T I KNOW THE UC AND CSU PROBABLY WOULDN'T LIKE IT. TO TAKE TO GET RID OF THAT MONEY BUT IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SIMPLIFYING IT AND MODERNIZING AND HAVING. YOU KNOW ONE PORTAL THAT LOOKS AT THE STUDENT THE NEED THE FAMILY CONTRIBUTION IT SEEMS SOMEONE ANY FISH AND THAT THERE'S THERE THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO GO TO DIFFERENT PLACES TO FIGURE IT OUT I THINK WE NEED A SYSTEM WHERE THE INSTEAD NAY COMMISSION AND THE CAMPUS. CLOSE ENOUGH FOR NATION THAT FROM THE STUDENTS PERSPECTIVE THEY CAN GET -- THEY CAN GET THAT SIMPLIFIED INFORMATION BUT ESPECIALLY WITH WHEN IT RICK WHEN IT COMES TO THE BROADER COST OF ATTENDANCE WE HAVE FOUND THAT THERE ARE LOCALIZED. ISSUES THAT WHERE IT DOES MAKE SENSE FOR THE SEGMENTS OF THE CAMPUSES TO HAVE SOME DISCRETION OVER EXACTLY HOW TO HOW TO ALLOCATE FUNDS -- AND USUALLY THOSE HAPPEN FAIRLY. LATE IN THE PROCESS ONCE DECISIONS AT ONCE THAT STUDENT IS ACTUALLY MADE A DECISION OF WHICH CAN'T WHAT CAMPUS I'M GOING TO WHAT IS MY LIVING SITUATION. THEY'RE GONNA BE SITUATIONS WHERE SOMEBODY HAVING MORE EXPENSIVE HOUSING -- MAKES SENSE AND THEY'RE GONNA BE SITUATIONS WHERE MAYBE THAT'S NOT GOOD MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T BE INCENTIVIZING THAT AND THAT'S GOING TO BE A LOCALIZED SORT OF THING THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER MEDINA. THANK YOU -- HANDLE ON THE DEPTH VERSES BREATH RIGHT DO WE GIVE MORE. MORE CAL GRANTS TO MORE INDIVIDUALS OR DO WE GIVE MORE MONEY TO A SMALLER GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS AND BOTH HAVE COST. AND AS WE LOOK TO TO READ -- ELIMINATING THE BARRIERS AGE BARRIER THAT WE ELIMINATE ALSO HAS COSTS. AND SO IT IS UP TO I THINK THIS COMMITTEE AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY MYSELF AS WE WORK ON THE BILL [inaudible] TO TO THINK ABOUT HOW. RIGHT OR WHICH BARRIERS ARE ARE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT I THINK THAT'S THE QUESTION -- FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER MCCARTY TO TRIED TO HELP THOSE PRIORITIZE. I AYE I HEARD ONE SUGGESTION OF THE LIMÃ³N EIGHTEEN GPA -- WAS AT A SUGGESTION THAT GPA -- NOT BE -- CONSIDER AT ALL AND RIGHT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THE IT'S KIND OF COMPLEX. RIGHT WHICH ONES [inaudible] YOU. QUALIFY FOR SO WAS A SUGGESTION NOT TO CONSIDER GPA AT ALL -- IT SO FOR AT LEAST FOR THE PUBLIC SEGMENTS THAT THE TO GET SOMEBODY WHO GETS INTO UNIT UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IS -- MILEY ACADEMIC QUALIFY ACADEMICALLY QUALIFIED AND SO TO QUIBBLE OVER AT A TWO POINT NINE VERSUS THREE POINT OH IN THE QUESTION OF THE DAY TAKING AP CLASSES AND ALL OF THAT IS NOT REALLY -- NECESSARY CSU IS SIMILAR -- COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE MORE -- BUT ENCOURAGING STUDENTS FROM WHATEVER BACKGROUND AND YET THERE'S A LOT OF STUDENTS A COMMUNITY COLLEGE YOU ARE FIVE YEARS TEN YEARS FIFTEEN YEARS OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL -- AND ARE MAKING A GO OF IT. AND GIVING THEM A CLEAR ROUTE FOR DOING SO -- AT THE START WITH A STRONG FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE IS MOST LIKELY TO GET THEM TO THE FINISH LINE ULTIMATELY SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE TOUGH. ON ON A KIND OF GPA I WOULD DO IT AFTER THAT FIRST YEAR I WOULD SAY YES YOU GET FINANCIAL AID IN ROLE GO FULL TIME MAKE A GO OF IT -- BUT IF IF FROM A BUDGET STANDPOINT WERE ALL WERE WORRIED OR FROM A BI&lt;c.cyan&gt; STANDPOINT WERE WORRIED&lt;/c&gt; ABOUT PEOPLE SOMEHOW TAKING ADVANTAGE OR SOMETHING THEN I'D SAY GET TOUGH. FOR STRONGLY ENCOURAGED GET GET THINGS OUT OF THE WAY YOU KNOW GET GET OUT OF THE WAY THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF GOSH ALL HAVE. TO MY HIGH SCHOOL WASN'T THAT GOOD -- GET THAT OUT OF THE WAY COMPLETELY. AND IF YOU NEED TO GET TOUGH GET TOUGHER. AFTER THE FIRST SEMESTER AFTER THE FIRST YEAR THROUGH IT WOULD. CREATE A A SIMPLER. ABSOLUTELY SIMPLE ARE AND IT WOULD ELIMINATE THE ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF BACK AND FORTH RIGHT NOW -- WITH BETWEEN -- HIGH SCHOOLS AND THIS TO NAY COMMISSION TRYING TO GPA RECORDS AND EVERYTHING WHICH ALL OF THAT STAFF TIME COULD BE USED -- ACTUALLY HELPING STUDENTS FIGURE OUT THERE -- THE FINANCIAL AID WHERE THEY COULD APPLY WHERE THEY COULD GO TO COLLEGE AND PUT SOMETHING IN LIKE YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN A CERTAIN GPA TO MAINTAIN YOUR RIGHT NOT CHATTED ASKED WHICH MOST COLLEGES HALF SO JUST BE A MATTER OF MONITORING THAT AND MAYBE PUTTING SOME MINIMUMS THEIR THANK [inaudible] YOU. YEAH ASSEMBLYMEMBER LIMA. THANK YOU AND JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT I THINK AND THERE'S ALWAYS THE THOUGH OF THE HARD. DECISION MAKING THAT INVOLVES WHAT WE WOULD IDEALLY LIKE TO SEE VERSUS WHAT WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO -- AND CERTAINLY IT'S A POSITIVE YEAR WHEN THERE'S AN INCREASE BUT AS MAY BE PROJECTED IN THE COMING YEARS THAT INCREASE WON'T. MAY NOT BE THERE IF THE ECONOMY DOESN'T A SUSTAIN ITSELF SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA JUST TOUCHED ON THE GRADE ASPECT OF IT. OF ALL OF THE SUGGESTIONS YOU'VE PROVIDED -- AGAIN CONSIDERING THAT SOME OUR CAPACITY ISSUES AND WHICH WHICH ACTUALLY YIELD THE GREATEST OUTCOMES. AND WHAT ARE THE GREATEST OUTCOME ARE THEY TIME TO DEGREE OR THE COMPLETION [inaudible] QUESTION. I THINK IT MIGHT DEPEND ON THE SIZE OF THE INVESTMENT -- I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I WOULD HAVE TO SAY IS CERTAINLY THE RESEARCH IS PRETTY AS CLEAR THAT -- FINANCIAL AID DOES SUPPORT STUDENTS AND ENROLLING IN COLLEGE COMPLETING COLLEGE AND SUPPORTING THEIR ABILITY TO TAKE MORE. COURSES PER TERM WHICH SPEAK AND SO I'M. I THINK IT'S IT'S HARD TO KNOW -- YOU KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH HOW MUCH WE'RE TALKING MY OPPOSE A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IT MIGHT BE A BIT DIFFERENT ANSWER. PICK ONE AND TELL ME THE ANSWER. AT THE END IS TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF WHERE I MEAN. IF THE IF THE DECISIONS HAVE TO BE MADE I I DON'T I'M NOT CLEAR ON WHAT THE RECOMMENDATION IS -- AND WHAT'S THE PRIORITY IS IS IT YOU KNOW TIME TO DEGREE IS A COMPLETION -- WE JUST THERE WERE THERE WAS A SUGGESTION MADE ABOUT NOT CONSIDERING GPA IN THE FIRST SEMESTER QUARTER BUT CONSIDERING IT THERE AFTER -- AND I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT OF ALL OF THE SUGGESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED THE LAST HOUR OR SO. WHICH IS GOING TO YIELD THE GREATER OUTCOME AND I AND YOU CAN PICK WHATEVER OUTCOME YOU WANT I'M JUST I WANT TO KNOW WHICH WOULD YIELD MOST TO ACHIEVE A CERTAIN OUTCOME. WHAT? ONE THING ARE. BUT AT THE TIME TO THINK ABOUT IS THAT. DEPENDING ON HOW THE PROGRAM IS STRUCTURED THE COULD BE A STATE GOLD LINKED TO THAT SO FOR EXAMPLE -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY REFERENCE TO THE IDEA OF A DEBT FREE COLLEGE GRANT PROGRAM AND PRESUMABLY THE GOAL IS TO CREATE A SYSTEM WHERE STUDENTS DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON DEBT WHERE. IF THEY CAN WORK A CERTAIN AMOUNT OR IF THEY OR THEIR FAMILY ARE CAPABLE OF PUTTING A CERTAIN REASON WHAT FURTHER EDUCATION. THE YOU KNOW DEBT WOULD BE AN ABSOLUTE LACK STUDENT RIGHT SO THE MODEL THAT THE LA -- RECOMMENDED THAT THE CENTURY FOUNDATION RECOMMENDED IN THE REPORT -- AND THAT IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE MODEL THAT YOU SEE USES IN THEIR EDUCATION FINANCE MODEL -- THAT YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT ESSENTIALLY SAYS IT PUTS A CAP ON THE STUDENTS EXPECTED CONTRIBUTION. RIGHT SO RIGHT NOW -- ARE FINANCIALLY BONTA PUTS A CAP ON THE AMOUNT OF A TO GET SO IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH YOUR COST OF ATTENDANCE AS YOUR CAL GRANT IS CAPPED AT TAX DOLLARS DEPENDING ON SEGMENT. THE COST OF ATTENDANCE SORT OF DEBT FREE MODEL PUTS A CAP ON HOW MUCH THE STUDENT HAS TO PAY OUT OF POCKET AND THEREFORE SAYS IF YOU CAN BRING THIS AMOUNT TO THE TABLE THE REST OF YOUR COSTS OF TOWNS WILL BE COVERED. WHATEVER IT IS FROM FEDERAL STATE INSTITUTIONAL AID AND THEN NOT MODEL WITH THE GOAL IS. TO REDUCE STUDENT DEBT BY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT PARTICULARLY FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS I THINK BUT THINK THERE BE MEASURABLE OUTCOMES THERE -- AND ESPECIALLY IF THE GOAL IS TO MAKE IT SO THE STUDENTS HAVE TO RELY ON DEATH SO THAT A STUDENT WHO IS ABLE TO FIND SOME REASONABLE AMOUNT OF WORK HOURS OR HAD SOME FAMILY INCOME THEY CAN RELY ON DEBT IS NOT SOMETHING IN THE OF THE FIRST. YOU KNOW FIRST DAY THINKING ALL RIGHT I'M GOING TO COLLABORATION WITH THE CAL STATE TO DISSOCIATION LOOKING AT CSU GRADUATES AND THEIR STUDENT AT LEVELS. AND WANT ONE OF THE STARKEST MOUNTAINS AT FINDINGS THAT WE HAD WAS THAT EIGHT IN TEN CSU GRADS HAD FAMILY INCOMES UNDER ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS -- SO IT IS THAT THAT IS VERY CLEARLY BEING DISPROPORTIONATELY HELD BY LOWER INCOME FAMILIES AND STUDENTS -- THAT SIMILAR TRENDS -- WE SEE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE DOING A SIMILAR ANALYSIS WITH THE UC STUDENT ASSOCIATION -- THAT'S FORTHCOMING OF NEXT MONTH SO I THINK I WOULD ALSO SAY I THINK IF YOU WANT IF THE GOALS COMPLETIO. I WOULD PUT THE MONEY INTO MORE GRANTS FOR MORE STUDENTS AND I THINK IF THE GOAL IS REDUCING DEBT. I WOULD PUT IN TO INCREASE THE COVERAGE ACCESS A WORD ASSEMBLYMEMBER LIVING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU TO THE PANELISTS AND THE I APOLOGIZE THE NEXT TWO PANELS BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE -- TO REMAIN AND MY QUESTIONS ARE AS MUCH TO THEM AS THEY ARE TO USE TO THIS PANEL -- WHERE YOU'VE BEEN DESCRIPTIVE ABOUT THE ABILITY FOR SEGMENTS TO BE CREATIVE OR WHAT WHAT BINDS THEM -- IN THEIR CREATIVITY BUT OF COURSE ACCESS TO RESOURCES IS ONE OF THEM -- BUT ALSO WHERE WE EMPHASIZE -- THE THE IMPORTANCE OF WHERE PEOPLE GET GET AN EDUCATION AND SO -- AS MUCH FOR YOU IS AS THOSE WHO ARE PAYING ATTENTION I STUDIED AT CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE BUT I WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GRADUATE IN A TIMELY MANNER WITHOUT. GOING TO TWO DIFFERENT COMMUNITY COLLEGES OR A PROFESSOR WHO LET ME TAKE A COURSE DURING THE SUMMER BUT REGISTER FOR IT IN THE FALL. SO WOULD HAVE TO PAY EXORBITANT SUMMER FEES AND DROP IT INTO MY FULL TIME COURSE LOAD IN IN THE FALL AND SHE DIDN'T BAT AN EYELASH WHEN SHE SAID ABSOLUTELY NOT A PROBLEM. AND SO THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF CREATIVITY AT EACH AND TO BE ABLE TO GRADUATE IN -- IN A WAY THAT SIDE. MINDFUL OF THE RESOURCE THAT WE ALL HAVE TO PUT TO IT. SO WHAT WHAT'S THAT LOS LEFT TO ME WHEN I REVIEW ALL OF THE FUNDS AND AND YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WE'RE WE'RE PUTTING TOWARDS DIFFERENT SEGMENTS IS THAT. AT AND INVESTED IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT AND IT'S A HUGE LIMITATION ON PEOPLE AND I THINK THAT NOT ONLY DO WE MISS OUT ON THAT BECAUSE OF THE AID THAT WE APPLY TO IT. BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF EMPHASIS THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN BE SUCCESSFUL AND EIGHT IS A IS A CONDUIT TO THAT SUCCESS FOR SO MANY STUDENTS. TO HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT RESPONSIBILITIES -- D. V.. WE WE GOT HURT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF WHAT YOU SEE IS DOING AND CAPPING HOW MUCH IS STUDENTS CONTRIBUTION SUPPOSED TO BE. AND SO THE QUESTION WITH ALL OF THAT LEADING UP TO IT IS WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF SEGMENTS IN OTHER SCHOOLS WHETHER IT'S THE THREE SECONDS OF PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION CALIFORNIA OR THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS. WHO ARE ABLE TO BE MORE CREATIVE? IN THEIR APPROACH SOME OF IT MIGHT BE ACCESS TO MONEY TO APPLY TO IT. BUT ALSO -- IN IN YOU KNOW THE CONCEPT OF THE CAL GRANT PLUS -- BEING CREATIVE IN THE WAY THAT WORKS TO WHERE THE STUDENTS HAVE THOSE NEEDS. DO THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS HAVE A LEG UP -- A BANDAGE ON THAT TYPE OF CREATIVITY IS IT. YOU SEE WITH ACCESS TO MORE FUNDRAISING AMONG THE PUBLIC SEGMENTS HOW WOULD YOU FIGURE THAT OUT AND THEN WHAT CAN WE DO AS LAWMAKERS. TO REDUCE THE THE FETTERS THAT THAT BIND THEM TO WHAT THEIR LIMITATIONS ARE. WELL THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION -- IN TERMS OF THE PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS -- I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR THE A CC YOU WHO I KNOW IS HERE TODAY. BUT I WOULD JUST. GUESS THAT IT WITH THERE'D AB PLUS SCHOOLS YOU MIGHT SEE EIGHTY PLUS DIFFERENT APPROACHES JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT. SCHOOLS IN TERMS OF THE FUNDS THEY HAVE AVAILABLE THE STUDENT POPULATION THEY SERVE -- AND SO FORTH CERTAINLY MANY OF THEM ARE ABLE TO GET CREATIVE I THINK THE QUESTION THAT YOU ASKED ABOUT THE CREATIVITY AT THE INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL GOES A LITTLE BIT TO WHAT MR CHARMIN WAS REFERENCING AND WHAT -- PRESENT UPON TANA CHANCELLOR WHITE MENTION IN THEIR SET OF PRINCIPLES FOR FINANCIALLY REFORM WHICH IS THAT THE IDEA THAT THE STUDENT IS. QUOTE UNQUOTE PACKAGE TO BEING THERE A AT THE CAMPUS LEVEL. AND CERTAINLY THE STUDENT A COMMISSION IS NOT PROPOSING THAT THE STATE TAKEOVER THAT PROCESS I THINK -- THAT IS WHERE YOU SEE INDIVIDUAL SITUATIONS THAT THERE'S A VERY UNIQUE I MEAN FOUR THOUSAND STUDENTS SIR BY CAL GRANT FOR THE THOUSAND STORIES AMONG THE STUDENTS YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN APPROACHED BY STUDENTS WHO JUST TO GIVE ONE EXAMPLE -- TELL ME THAT -- THAT THEIR THEIR LGBT Q. AND THEIR PARENTS -- DON'T WANT TO SUPPORT THEM IN COLLEGE BUT OF COURSE FASTER REQUIRES A CALCULATION BASED ON PARENTAL INCOME AND IN THOSE CASES I KNOW THEY CAN GO TO THEIR CAMPUS FINANCIAL AID OFFICE AND GET WHAT'S CALLED A PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT. OVERRIDE THAT SOMETHING THAT IS CLEARLY MORE APPROPRIATELY HANDLED AT THE CAMPUS LEVEL THAN. AT THE STATE LEVEL FROM A SACRAMENTO BASED BUREAUCRACY -- BUT I THINK THAT -- I THINK THAT IT JUST TOOK SERVE BECAUSE THE QUESTION OF INSTITUTIONAL LATER HOW RATHER THAN THE STATE'S SWEEPING IT WOULD BE MORE OF A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE INSTITUTIONS I THINK -- A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS IS WHAT'S CALLED FOR HERE AT THAT SORT OF ADDRESSES WHAT YOU'RE ASKING. IF IF I MAY I EIGHT YOU KNOW I TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT A CONSENSUS APPROACH AND HOW THERE'S THIS FAIRLY SIMILAR MODEL THAT'S NOW BEEN PROPOSED BY SEVERAL OTHER ENTITIES AND I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DID NOT MENTION. THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY A CAN TO WHAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DOES CURRENTLY THEY HAVE WHAT THEY CALL AN EDUCATION FINANCE MODEL THEY CALL THEIR EFM. AND IT DOES EXACTLY WHAT I'VE MENTIONED IT LOOKS AT THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE WHAT'S REASONABLE FOR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES AND THEN IT COVERS THE REST THROUGH FINANCIALLY THAT COMMUNICATES AT TO STUDENTS AND FAMILIES CLEARLY -- NO IT'S NOT PERFECT IT WAS PERFECT WE WOULDN'T SEE THE DISPROPORTIONATE DEBT THAT I THAT I JUST MENTIONED A MINUTE AGO BUT I THINK IT DOES SPEAK TO CREATIVITY. AND THE CREATIVITY THAT COLLEGES CAN ENGAGE THE MESSAGING IN TERMS OF PACKAGING WHEN THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S FORTUNATE TO HAVE AN ENROLLMENT OF BY STUDENT BODY THAT'S VERY ALIGNED WITH THAT CAL GRANT ENTITLEMENT POPULATION -- AND THEN THEY ALSO HAVE QUITE A BIT OF INSTITUTIONAL EIGHT OF THEIR OWN TO DOLE OUT SO -- CREATIVITY IS GREAT AND WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE AT AND RESOURCES SURELY HELP THAT. OKAY THANK YOU SOMEONE EVER GABRIEL INSTA MARTUCCI. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD THIS IS MY FIRST TIME SITTING ON THIS COMMITTEE AND I APOLOGIZE. FOR BEING LATE WAS TESTIFYING ON ANOTHER WHAT BILL IN ANOTHER COMMITTEE SO I DIDN'T HEAR THE BEGINNING OF OF OF YOUR PRESENTATION BUT I'VE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE CAL GRANTS AND I'M JUST CURIOUS. YOUR ASSESSMENT OF THAT -- AND ALSO AS WE THINK ABOUT -- LONGER TERM MORE STRUCTURAL REFORMS DOES IT MAKE SENSE BUT POTENTIALLY TO INCREASE OF EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF CAL GRANTS NOW TO HELP STUDENTS THAT ARE. IN IN -- INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING NOW -- IN THE NEAR FUTURE AS WERE CONSIDERING SOME OF THESE LONGER TERM STRUCTURAL CHANGES. I'D SAY THAT YES TO BOTH SO EXPAND IT MORE COMPETITIVE AWARDS IS FILLING REAL NEEDS THAT WE'VE ALREADY DETERMINED A REAL NEEDS. FOR STUDENTS WHO -- WHO HAVE EXPENSES THAT THEY UNABLE TO COVER -- AND AND THE MORE THAT WE START FILLING THOSE GAPS IN THE WAYS THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING -- THE CLOSER WILL GET TO BEING ABLE TO HAVE SOME MORE EXPANSIVE REFORMS WHERE PERHAPS EVEN SOME SOME OF THAT ARE NOW COMPETITIVE CAL GRANTS. BECOME SOMETHING THAT IS -- AN ENTITLEMENT THAT WE CAN COMMUNICATE AND EARLIER WAY WITH WITH STUDENTS AND MORE EVEN MORE EFFECTIVELY AFFECT THEIR LIKELIHOOD OF AND THEN ROLLING LIKELIHOOD OF ENROLLING FULL TIME -- AND THEN COMPLETING. I WOULD ECHO THAT AND TO SAY THAT -- THE LONG TERM FOCUS IS APPRECIATED BECAUSE THERE'S A GREAT CHART IN THE GENDER THAT THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET POLICY CENTER PREPARE THE SHOWS THAT THE DEMAND FOR THE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT PROGRAM HAS. MORE THAN DOUBLED IN THE PAST DECADE WHERE THE NUMBER OF AWARDS THE STATE HAS INCREASED ONLY SLIGHTLY SO -- ABSOLUTELY APPRECIATE THAT TO SOMEONE OR SPECIFICALLY -- THE THE EQUITY FOR THE DREAMER POPULATION I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE LEGISLATION TO EXPAND A COMPETITIVE CALVET ELIGIBILITY TO DREAMERS ASSEMBLY MEMBER KNOWN AS IS RUNNING LEGISLATION. TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL AID TO THAT POPULATION BECAUSE A CURRENTLY LEFT OUT A FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID. IS A GOOD LONG TERM FOCUS FOR THE STATE I THINK BECAUSE OF THAT POPULATION IS ALSO ONLY GOING TO GROW. THANK YOU AT THAT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND MISTER -- MEDINA AUTHORED A BILL ON THAT A FEW YEARS AGO AND WE DID INCREASE THE COMPATIBLE WORDS TWO YEARS AGO AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HE HAS A SLIGHT INCREASE. ONE ISSUE THAT THAT CAME UP AND I'M SURE MR GABRIEL IN THE DEBATE WILL TALK ABOUT THIS IS. I I I I THINK WE SHOULD DO IT INCREASING PET AWARDS BUT THERE IS A REPORTFOR YEARS AGO IF MR NEED COMMISSION WHEN THEY LOOKED AT COMPETITIVE STUDENTS THE COMPATIBLE -- APPLICANTS WHO DID NOT GET THE AWARD. AND YOU KNOW THAT THAT THAT CLASS -- HAPPY HAPPY EMPTY SAYS THOSE YOU KNOW FOLKS ARE GOING TO NOT GO TO COLLEGE. AND NOT HAVE A GOOD HIGHER EDUCATION FULLER APPARENTLY FOUND THAT THE STUDENTS DID GO TO COLLEGE AND WERE SUCCESSFUL IN SOME SOME WAY SO IT IS THERE ANY -- DATA THAT SHOWS THAT IT'S THAT SMART INVESTMENT OR MORE NOT SO. I BELIEVE YOU'RE REFERRING TO A REPORT THAT -- WAS PREPARED ON OUR BEHALF THROUGH US STANFORD RESEARCHER WE WORK WITH NAMED A DEAD GRANTS -- AND NOT BEING A RESEARCHER AT MY MY UNDERSTANDING FROM MY COLLEAGUES TO SUMMARIZE THE REPORT -- FOR ME IN. AND THEY EXPLAINED LIKE I'M FIVE METHOD WHICH I HAVE TO ASK FOR A LOT FROM. MY RESEARCHER COLLEAGUES -- ESSENTIALLY THE REPORT LOOKED AT MANY YEARS OF THE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT RECIPIENTS AT OUR STATE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND DID CONCLUDE THE FOR THAT POPULATION. THERE APPEARED TO BE A NEGLIGIBLE IMPACT ON THEIR GRADUATION OR THEIR COME ATTAINMENT -- WHETHER THEY RECEIVE THE COMPETITIVE VERSUS STUDENTS WHO WERE ELIGIBLE AND DIDN'T QUITE MAKE INTO THAT POOL. BUT A COUPLE OF THINGS TO NOTE THE REPORT DID SAY THAT -- IT WASN'T NECESSARILY THE RESULT OF THE THE STUDENTS MAY BE NEEDING SOME ADDITIONAL SUPPORT SERVICES ON CAMPUS BECAUSE THEY'RE FROM. WHAT WE USED TO CALL NONTRADITIONAL POPULATION MAYBE FIRST GENERATION AND THERE MAY BE FOR SOME OF THEM LANGUAGE BARRIERS SO THE REPORT -- DIDN'T NECESSARILY CONCLUDE THAT IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE GRANT THAT THERE WAS A MINIMAL. DIFFERENCE THERE MAY BE OTHER FACTORS AND ALSO SINCE THEN. THE STATE OF THE LEGISLATURE THE MINISTRATION HAVE FUNDED -- BUTTONS COCHRAN REFERENCE THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FULL TIME COMPLETION GRANTS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WHICH PROVIDE THAT A CAL GRANT BE STUDENT AT COMMUNITY COLLEGE GETTING A COMPETITIVE AWARD CAN GET UP TO FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL A PER YEAR SO -- I THINK BAR AND WE WOULD SAY THAT -- IT BE REALLY GOOD TO SEE WHETHER THOSE GRANTS AND SOME OF THE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT SERVICES THE COMMUNICATIVE HAVE ADDED UNDER CHANCELLOR OAKLEY LEADERSHIP IN THE LEGISLATURE'S COMMITMENT HAVE HAD AN IMPACT MY GAS MY EXTREMELY AN EDUCATED GUESS WOULD BE THAT THEY HAVE. THEY CAN START SEARCHING. THANK YOU IDEA OF JUST TRYING TO DIGEST ALL THIS INFORMATION I WAS JUST LIKE LOOKING THROUGH YOUR REPORT HERE AND AND THE SEA ALL THIS WONDERFUL DATA -- SO I IDEA. TRYING -- TO MAKE SENSE OF IT ALL I I APOLOGIZE IF I MIGHT ASK A SOMETHING THAT -- MIGHT HAVE BEEN. ADDRESS TO EARLIER ON ONE OF THESE REPORTS -- YOU KNOW YOU. YOU STARTED OFF BUT MISTER O'BRIEN TALKING ABOUT -- HOW CALIFORNIA'S FINANCIAL AID -- PROGRAM OVER OVERALL IS THE ENVY OF THE NATION ARE. AND IF THERE IS A STATISTIC AND THE STAFF REPORT THAT WAS PRESENTED TO FOR THIS COMMITTEE HEARING ON ON PAGE SIX THAT THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE STUDENTS NOW GRADUATE WITH AN AVERAGE DEBT OF A LITTLE UNDER. TWENTY THREE THOUSAND A HOW DOES AT TWENTY THREE THOUSAND AVERAGE DEBT COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE NATION. I WOULD ACTUALLY -- DIFFERS **** ON THAT BECAUSE THEY KNOW TAKE IS DOES A LOT OF GREAT WORK ON STUDENT DEBT. THANK YOU -- AT CALIFORNIA IS WHAT WE CALL CONSIDER WE HAVE -- FOR OVER A DECADE DONE AN ANALYSIS STATE BY STATE OF THE STUDENT LOAN DEBT OF COLLEGE GRADUATES AND IN CALIFORNIA'S CONSISTENTLY IN THE BOTTOM TEN IN BOTH IN TERMS OF THE SHARE OF COLLEGE GRADUATES LEAVING SCHOOL WITH THAT AND THE AVERAGE AT THAT THEY LEAVE WITH -- UNFORTUNATELY WE AREN'T ABLE TO SAY ABOUT OTHER STATES IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LOOK AT IT FOR YOU SEE GRADUATES AND CSU GRADUATES IN TERMS OF THE DISPROPORTION AUDI OF THAT DEBT AND THAT'S ONE OF OUR REGULAR RECOMMENDATIONS TO OTHER STATES TED TED RARELY ASK YOUR COLLEGES. NOT JUST HOW MANY ARE GRADUATING WITH DEBT BUT WHICH STUDENTS ARE GRADUATING WITH THAT. AND AND SO ALONG THE THAT THE THE LINES OF WHICH STUDENTS ARE GRADUATING WITH DEBT. IN IN CALIFORNIA -- MEDIA WHO WHO. HE ATE AND HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOU KNOW WHERE THAT THE DEBT IS CONCENTRATED THE MOST. IT IS IN A LOT FOR EXAMPLE LIKE -- WHAT WHEN I'M TALKING WITH CONSTITUENTS OFTEN -- THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE SURPRISED. TO TO HEAR THAT -- THAT OVER HALF OF OF OF ALL -- AT LEAST BERKELEY AND UCLA UNDERGRADUATES HAVE THEIR ENTIRE TUITION -- COVERED BY THE STATE -- A LOT OF MY CONSTITUENTS OR OR OR OR SURPRISING EVEN -- YOU KNOW A QUESTION THE THAT. THE THE THE TRUTH OF THAT -- BUT I MEAN GIVEN THE PROGRESSIVE NATURE OF CALIFORNIA'S. A FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM OVERALL MAIN. HOW WAS THAT THE AVERAGE DE DISTRIBUTED? TO YOU KNOW -- AMONG DIFFERENT -- INCOME LEVELS AND AMONG THE THE DIFFERENT. HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS -- SO WE HAVE DONE AN ANALYSIS WITH THE COUNTY STUDENT ASSOCIATION FOR CSU GRADUATES AND WE HAVE A ONE FOURTH COMING FOR YOU SEE GRADUATE SECOND SPEAK MOST CLEARLY TO THE CSU SITUATION -- AND THERE'S NO SYSTEM IDEA -- FOR FOR PRIVATE COLLEGES IN TERMS OF WHICH STUDENTS HAVE -- DEBT AT CSU IT'S AS I MENTIONED EARLIER IT'S ABOUT AN EIGHT AND TEN THE LOAN THAT HAVE FAMILY INCOMES UNDER ABOUT FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND IN FACT IT'S ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF CSU GRADUATES WITH WITH STUDENT LOAN THAT. HAVE FAMILY INCOMES UNDER. TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND IS OUR STUDENTS WHO HAVE THEIR TUITION COVERED THESE ARE STUDENTS WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO PAY FOR THOSE NON TUITION COSTS OF COLLEGE -- WE ALSO IN OUR REPORT LOOKED AT BREAKDOWNS BY RACE AND ETHNICITY AND IT WAS EIGHT IN TEN BLACK STUDENTS THAT WERE GRADUATING FROM CSU WHO WERE LIVING WITH STUDENT LOAN DEBT SO HIGHLY CONCENTRATED AMONGST LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND STUDENTS OF COLOR. AND AND AND SO I I DID SEE THAT -- TO THAT INFORMATION BUT IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF DEBT -- IN NOT NOT JUST THE THE NUMBERS OF STUDENTS GRADUATE WITH THAT BUT THE THE WHO HAS THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF DEBT. I'M INTERESTINGLY OF OF OF THE DATA THAT WE'VE SEEN FOR UNDERGRADUATE WE'RE LOOKING A OF THE DEBT AMOUNTS -- FOR INDEBTED GRADUATE SEEMS TO BE ABOUT THE SAME ACROSS INCOME LEVELS SO THAT DOESN'T VERY NEARLY AS MUCH AS STUDENTS LIKELY HAD OF LEAVING SCHOOL WITH THAT TRIP PACKED. SO SO LOW INCOME STUDENTS WHO WOULD HAVE. ON AVERAGE WOULD BE -- GRADUALLY WITH ABOUT CONSTITUENTS OR OF OUR MIDDLE CLASS STUDENTS. FOR THOSE THOSE WITH THAT YES. OKAY THANK YOU THE CLIP. IT'S STILL ABOUT ROUGHLY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE GRAND FOR UC AND CSU. I'M THAT THAT NUMBER I BELIEVE IS FOR ARMS GRADUATES FROM ALL TYPES OF COLLEGES ACROSS THE STATE OR AT LEAST PUBLIC AND NONPROFIT COLLEGES -- AMONGST THE UC AND CSU SYSTEM THE DEBT LOADS ARE A LITTLE BIT LOWER OKAY THANK YOU DOCTOR CHOI. OKAY THANK YOU. OUR SHOW IS A BORN AND TRYING TO ATTEND THE COLLEGE -- BUT THIS TIME WHEN -- SO MUCH MONEY SEEMS TO BE AVAILABLE -- BECAUSE THE FIRST GENERATION IMMIGRANT. TO WHO CAME HERE WITH A FIFTY DOLLARS IN MY POCKET THE I GOT MY MASTER'S DEGREE AND A PHD. AND THEN -- HOW DO YOU KNOW AT SO FOUR IN STUDENT AT THAT TIME -- I I I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD COVER MY TO SHOWN WHY ANY ROOM ROOM BOULDER -- A FINAL [inaudible] UP [inaudible] HIGHER EDUCATION. IS A VERY COSTLY END A WE NEED TO PROVIDE US MUCH AS POSSIBLE. WHEN I WONDER? I WORKED AS A BUSBOY DISHWASHER ALL KINDS OF YOU KNOW STREET VENDOR. OF TO MAKE A FEW BUCKS -- TO COVER MY TUITION -- AND THAT THE PHD LEVEL OF A LUCKILY I HAD -- SOME -- UPGRADED THE SYSTEM SHIP -- TO COVER MY AMENDED THAT WAS A PAID THE BUT TO SCHOOL FOR MY TO SHOWN THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH -- SO -- IN AMONG MANY MANY QUESTIONS SOME A MOM MAYBE ON OUR ADDRESS OF TWO AREAS SO -- NUMBER ONE IS -- YOU MENTIONED THAT THE BEYOND THE TREE SHOWN IT DOES COST MONEY -- LEAVING A ROMAN WAR. AND YOUR DIRECTIONS -- SOUNDS LIKE GO. WE NEED TO PROVIDE AID THE ALL THE COST ABOVE WHAT [inaudible] THE TUITION. DAY IN THAT THE BIG IDEA. A TUITION FOR COLLEGE FOR EVERYBODY HOW MR NATIONALLY THE SOME NATIONAL ISSUE. CAN THERE BE VERY IDEA. HOW MUCH WILL IT COST OF FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO COVER ALL THE STUDENTS WHO WENT WOMAN BOARD INTO TUITION -- YEAH AND THE GRADUATE THAT WITH THE TAX FREE DARBY REALLY IDEA -- BUT THE UNTIL WE ARE ABLE TO UP [inaudible] COVER. HERE ARE OF THOSE EXPENSES SO I WONDER IF -- YEAH. YOU. PUT THAT INTO EQUATION. ANTICIPATE THE STUDENTS SO NOW. WHAT CAN EARN SOME OF THE OUR LIVING EXPENSES SO? SHE JUST LIKE ALL IN ALL I WORK HARD. AND THAT NOT I GRADUATE I GRADUATED OUT WITHOUT -- RELATIVELY LOW -- THAT THE DID WORK -- THEY CAN WORK OF TIME AND WHAT KIND OF BIT INCOME YOU CAN ANTICIPATE THE STATE TO WORK A CERTAIN NUMBER OF HOURS PER WEEK -- ETCETERA ETCETERA. AND THEN REMAIN DOCTOR AND BE ASSISTED. TO FOR A CERTAIN. REASONABLE AMOUNT OF UP TO ME. TWENTY SIX SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. ATTACKED AFTER GRADUATION -- MENDES SO PRETTY GOOD DEAL WITH THE MORE. ARRESTS OF THE EXPENSES SO UP PAID [inaudible] TO COMMON NON. YOU WHAT I EXPECT THE SOME LEVEL. OF A NOT ONLY PARACEL CONTRIBUTION BUT THE INDIVIDUAL OR US STUDENTS TO EFFORT. TO MAKE IT. IN THIS COUNTRY. ARE UP TO HIGH SCHOOL IS THE MANDATORY TESTAMENTUM MINIMUM EDUCATION WE ARE EXPECTING. OKAY COLLEGES IS SAW OPTION ALL. WHAT'S THE WE ARE TRYING. TO ENCOURAGE AND ANNOUNCES THAT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. SO I THINK HE HAS TO BE MUTUAL. OF CONTRIBUTION. AND THEN I HAVE INTRODUCED A BE ALL -- TO ENCOURAGE PARENTS OF GRANDPARENTS A RELATIVE SO ANY ANY COMPANY. ON TO GET THE TAX DEDUCTION ARE IN CALIFORNIA. IN OUR AREA SO FIVE TWENTY NINE PLAN. THAT THE INVESTMENT THE GROWTH PORTION IS A TAX FREE ON THIS THAT. WE CAN DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE FEDERAL PORTION OF TAX. BUT THE IF I INVESTED THE I JUST AHEAD WHEN YOU ORDER UP WHEN CHILD IF I INVESTED THOUSAND DOLLARS EVERY YEAR. I WISH I CAN GET THEM. TAX DEDUCTION AS AN ENCOURAGEMENT [inaudible] AND THE ANY ANY OTHER PEOPLE -- NO RELATIVES SO WHO ARE EVEN COMPANY -- MORE FOR EXAMPLE MIKE. IN AUSTIN AND ALSO A COMPANY MAY INVEST IN IN THAT THE THE EMPLOYEES SO FAMILY COLLEGE. TUITION AND THEN GET THE TAX CREDIT. AND THE SHOW MUCH PEOPLE. AROUND THAT THE FAMILY ONE PRO EASE SO WE CAN GET THE CAN ATTRACT. US SOME INVESTMENT FOR THE FUTURE. SO RATHER THAN JUST OF FREE GOVERNMENT GIVEAWAY CAN WE ALSO CONSIDER. A TO ENCOURAGE IT INCENTIVIZE. HARRIS OF RELATIVES AND COMPANIES TO TO MAKE UP SOME PORTION. SO THAT. THEY CAN FROM THE BOOKS ARE. BASED UPON THEIR FAMILY INCOME CERTAIN PORTION CAN BE INVESTED AND THEN -- GOVERNMENT THE IS SO IN -- ENCOURAGING FOR TEXTING. THE LOOK AT THE LIST OF TAX DEDUCTION IS NOT TAX CREDIT THE IN ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS WOULD BE TAXED SO INTO DOT THE IT. OF FOR THE REMAIN TOLD THE TAX -- TO SO -- THE INVESTMENT IN SCHOLARSHIP AND DOT ORG PEOPLE IN THE SOCIETY CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THAT AND THAT. AT GET THE SOME BENEFIT. DOCTOR CHOI -- BEFORE THE ANSWER EYES WHEN A MAYBE SET THE STAGE A LITTLE BIT SO -- WE WE AGREE 1100% AND WITH THIS IS THAT THIS TODAY'S HEARING IS A CULMINATION OF THE LAST TWO YEARS ON THIS ISSUE. AND WE KNOW WE CAN'T AFFORD FREE COLLEGE IN CALIFORNIA FOR EVERYBODY. I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW SHOULD BE BE SUBSIDIZING -- MY KIDS TO GO TO YOU SEE ONE DAY THAT BE NICE BUT I'M NOT SURE WE CAN AFFORD IT. I KNOW -- MISTER MARTUCCI AND ARKANSAS HERE WOULD LIKE THAT TO WITH THEIR LITTLE KIDS IN AND MR GABRIEL APPEAR BUT I'M NOT SURE IF IT MAKES THE MOST SENSE -- BECAUSE WE HAVE OTHER NEEDS BUT I THINK HERE IS DOING WHAT YOU'RE JUST SAYING SO PARENTS STUDENTS HAVE SKIN IN THE GAME -- FAMILY SAVE IN THE FIVE TWENTY NINE ACCOUNTS WE'RE JUST LOOKING AT THAT THE GAP IN THAT THE THE COST OF COLLEGE IS DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS WHEN YOU WENT TO COLLEGE OR TWENTY YEARS AGO. THE MINIMUM WAGE DOESN'T GO AS FAR TO TO FOR STUDENTS TAKE EARNERS EXTRA BOX TO PAY. FOR THE COST OF COLLEGE -- THE HOUSING COSTS HAVE GONE UP TREMENDOUSLY AND SO THOSE TWO THINGS RIGHT THERE REALLY CHANGE THE WHOLE ECONOMICS OF IT SO WHAT SO WHAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON IS HOW COULD WE DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING -- HAVE A A MEANS TESTED SYSTEM HAVE PARENTS AND STUDENTS. PARTICIPATE -- AS WELL -- BUT LOOK AT WHERE THE GAPS ARE TO MAKE COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE SO MAYBE YOU COULD JUMP IN. TRY THAT ON THE TAX CREDIT -- ISSUE I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF POTENTIAL FOR COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS ESPECIALLY FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS TO SEND A MESSAGE ABOUT PLANNINGFOR COLLEGE I'VE MONEY IN THE BANK THEY KNOW IT. AS THEY'RE GROWING UP I THINK THERE'S A THERE IS A LOT OF POTENTIAL THERE -- THE BIG QUESTION IS REACH AND HOW DO YOU FOR A POPULATION THAT -- WHO DOES NOT HAVE JUST INCOME AND IS -- PROBABLY -- AND IT IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO BE TAKING DEDUCTIONS ON THEIR ON THEIR TAXES -- THAT INCENTIVE IS NOT LIKELY TO BE THE ONE THAT ENTERS THEM INTO THE SYSTEM -- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE GOVERNOR WHEN HE WAS -- MAYOR SAN FRANCISCO WAS -- LAUNCHED A PROGRAM OR EXPANDED A PROGRAM THERE THAT PROVIDED -- A SEAT ABOUT OF OF SAVINGS TO EVERY CHILD BORN IN THE CITY I THINK THAT'S THE WAY IT WAS DESIGNED AND I THINK I HEARD THAT THERE'S A PROPOSAL TO EXPAND THAT CONCEPT -- STATE STATEWIDE -- IF YOU ARE EXTREMELY LOYAL YOU GET FREE TUITION IF IF YOU ARE EXTREMELY RICH YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BECAUSE YOU PAY. HOW ABOUT IN THEM BORDERLINE? I MEAN THEY NEED ASSISTANCE -- TO SO THAT THAT'S THE SECOND TIME I'M A SPEAKING YEAH YEAH AND THAT CUT AND THIS THE SAVINGS INCENTIVES THAT EXIST AND DO TEND -- TO THE PARTICIPANTS TEND TO BE AND UPPER INCOME -- TERRITORY SO -- SURE THAT OTHERS SAY AND THAT THEY KNOW THEY HAVE SAVINGS NOT JUST FOR TUITION BUT FOR THOSE OTHER EXPENSES WERE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE GETTING TO TO YOUR YOUR EARLIER POINT ABOUT. WORKING YOUR WAY THROUGH COLLEGE WE HAVE THE STRUCTURE OF A CON A MI HAS CHANGED SO MUCH THAT IT USED TO BE THAT YOU CAN WORK PART TIME AND COVER. UP RENT AND FOOD -- AT SCHOOL BUT WITH WAGES THE WAY THEY ARE NOW FOR NON COLLEGE GRADUATES IT IS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH TO DO THAT WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE -- THAT COST ISSUES THAT WE HAVE EVEN WHEN TUITION IS WAIVED. AND I JUST WANNA NOTICEABLY MEMBER -- THIS STUDENT AID COMMISSION IS -- ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN -- WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ENCOURAGE FAMILIES TO SET UP THOSE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS WHEN THE CHILD IS YOUNG SO -- LAST YEAR -- THE THINGS TO LEGISLATION THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- MCCARTY -- AUTHORED AND TOOK THE LEAD ON WE STARTED ADMINISTERING THE EVERY KID COUNTS PROGRAM WHICH IS WERE REACHING OUT TO CITIES LIKE SAN FRANCISCO SACRAMENTO'S GETTING ONE SET UP. ON IN MY CITY WEST SACRAMENTO THEY HAVEN'T CALLED HOME RUN BECAUSE ON LOW INCOME FAMILIES IN PARTICULAR AND THE IDEA IS THAT WHEN THE STUDENT ENTERS. KINDERGARTEN OR SCHOOL THE CITY SAYS HEY YOU WE'RE GONNA HELP YOU OPEN A SAVINGS ACCOUNT WILL PUT A LITTLE BIT IN TO BEGIN WITH AND THEN WE CAN MATCH SOME THAT YOU PUT IN EVERY YEAR. OR WHATEVER IT IS EVEN IF IT'S JUST A SMALL AMOUNT AND AS MISTER SHERMAN MENTION THE IMPORTANT THING WITH THE COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS IS THE REACH AND ENSURING THAT THAT GETS. TO SOME OF THE LOWER INCOME FAMILIES WHO SIMPLY MAY NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO SET UP THAT SAVINGS ACCOUNT BUT ALSO TO YOUR POINT ABOUT THE TOTAL COST WHEN THAT STUDENT GETS TO COLLEGE IF THEY HAVE THAT MONEY THAT SAVINGS ACCOUNT. THEN THAT IS THAT IS GOES TOWARDS THEIR TOTAL FINANCING IT'S NOT JUST. THE STATE OR THE GOVERNMENT COVERING THE WHOLE THING IF THEY IF THEY DO HAVE SAVINGS THAT SET ASIDE FOR COLLEGE. THEN THEY CAN RELY ON THAT AS WELL. TO THANK YOU. I I HAD ONE MORE AT MAYBE I WANNA KNOWLEDGE A COUPLE THINGS FIRST -- I THINK SOME OF THE DISCUSSION THAT WE'RE HAVING HERE THIS MORNING GOES TO WHETHER -- HIGHER EDUCATION IS A A PRIVATE OR PUBLIC GOOD AND I THINK WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE HERE -- THAT HIGHER EDUCATION IS A PUBLIC GOOD SO IT IS NOT JUST THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL BUT THAT WE REACH THAT WE READ. AS A AS A STATE AS AN ECONOMY OF FROM THE FRUITS OF THOSE -- THE ECONOMIC AND AJ GRADUATE THE BUILDS ON THE ECONOMY OF CALIFORNIA. AND I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED WHEN MY FATHER CAME TO THIS COUNTRY FROM -- PANAMA IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT TO GO TO SCHOOL HE WAS ABLE. TO WORK IN THE SUMMER CATALINA AS A BELL HOP. OR WORK DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR WHEN HE WAS ATTENDING SAN JOSE STATE -- IN THE CANNERIES TO PAY FOR HIS TUITION AND SUPPORT HIS FAMILY. MYSELF AND MY SISTER AND OUR MOTHER. I WORK IN THE CANNERIES BUT DEFINITELY THOSE TIMES ARE GOT -- AND IF THAT IS NOT -- ANY ANYWHERE NEAR WITH THE REALITY IS AND TO THAT I WANT TO ASK A QUESTION IF. YOU SEE STUDENTS AND THE AMOUNT THAT THEY'RE EXPECTED LOW INCOME UC STUDENTS. AND THE AMOUNT THAT THEIR FAMILIES AND THEY ARE. EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE. ARE THOSE REASONABLE I I I HEAR FROM A LOT OF THE STUDENTS THAT THAT IS MORE THAN THEIR FAMILIES CAN. ACTUALLY AFFORD -- THE CONTRIBUTION AND THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT THEY ARE ASKED TO DO. YOU KNOW -- THE TIME THAT IT TAKES FOR THEM -- TO IN THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY. TIME OUT OF SCHOOL WORKING SO THAT REASONABLE TO EXPECT THE LOWEST -- EARNING FAMILIES TO CONTRIBUTE BECAUSE I HEAR FROM STUDENTS THAT IT'S NOT. I'M I WOULD SAY I THINK THERE'S REASON TO QUESTION WHETHER IT REALLY IS I THINK THE U. I MENTIONED BEFORE THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA EFM THEIR EDUCATION FINANCE MODEL. AND IT'S BUILT ON A PRINCIPLE THAT STUDENTS ACROSS ALL INCOME RANGES SHOULD CONTRIBUTE THE SAME AMOUNT IT'S ROUGHLY ABOUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR AND THAT CAN BE FROM WORK THAT COULD BE FROM DEBT. NOW. IF IT IS TRUE THAT THAT'S INEQUITABLE APPROACH THAN YOU WOULD SEE EQUAL LEVELS OF BORROWING SOME STUDENTS IN EACH INCOME CATEGORY WHICH USED TO BORROW SOME WHICH IS TO WORK. BUT THE TWIST IT SHOULD BE ROUGHLY SIMILAR BUT WE DON'T SEE THAT BECAUSE WE ARE SEEN YOUR THREE QUARTERS OF THE LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS. LEAVING SCHOOL WITH THAT MUCH HIGHER SHARE THAN ANY OTHER INCOME GROUP SO SOMETHING SOMETHING ABOUT THAT MODEL IS NOT WORKING AND IT COULD BE THAT STUDENTS HAVE IN THAT INCOME RANGE HAVE A HARDER TIME ACCESS SEEN. GOOD JOB SOLID JOBS OR MAYBE JOBS THAT MAKE ABOVE MINIMUM WAGE. IT COULD BE THAT -- THOSE STUDENTS ARE HAVING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR FAMILIES RIGHT NOT THAT THEIR FAMILIES CONTRIBUTED TO THEM THEY'RE CONTRIBUTING TO THEIR FAMILIES WHICH MAKES LESS OF THEIR EARNINGS AVAILABLE FOR SCHOOL COSTS -- IT COULD BE ANY ONE OF A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT COULD BE THAT THE COSTS THAT ARE ESTIMATED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THAT'S ACTUALLY SENDING THEIR FINANCIAL AID ELIGIBILITY ARE INADEQUATE -- BUT I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT I THINK YOU'RE ON TO SOMETHING THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM IT'S SHOWING UP IN OUR LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND IT NEEDS MORE EXPLORATION. HOW DO I WOULD WE -- HELP ALLEVIATE THAT THAT PROBLEM FOR THOSE STUDENTS. LIKE WHAT CAN WE DO -- ONE OPTION WOULD BE TO INCREASE THE FINANCIAL AID FOR THE LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA -- GIFTS THAT SOME OF THE LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS. ARE ELIGIBLE FOR BOTH CAL GRANT EIGHT AND CAL GRANT BE -- AND WHAT THE STUDENT COMMISSION DOES BOTH TYPES OF GRANTS AS THEY GIVE THE STUDENT ONE THAT'S MOST VALUABLE TO THEM -- YOU KNOW SO RIGHT NOW THAT WOULD BE THE CAL GRANT A AWARD IF WE INCREASE THE CAL GRANT BE ACCESS AWARD MORE OF THEM WOULD GET CAL GRANT THE AWARDS AND WE WOULD THEN NEED. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ALLOWED STUDENTS TO BENEFIT FROM THAT ADDITIONALLY IT. AND DIDN'T JUST ROLL IT BACK UP INTO THEIR OTHER INSTITUTIONAL PACKAGING. NOT JUST -- ACTUALLY MAKE IT SO THAT IT THEY BENEFIT FROM THAT YES AND NOT JUST TAKE AWAY MANY EXACTLY RIGHT RIGHT NOW RIGHT RIGHT EXACTLY TAKE BACK SOME OF THEIR OWN INSTITUTIONALLY THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING TO THOSE STUDENTS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE IT TO OTHERS THANK YOU. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE'RE GOING TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND WE WILL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PANELIST AND I INVITE THE PANELS REPRESENTING. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT COLLEGES TO COME TO THE TABLE. AND AS THEY'RE COMING I WILL INTRODUCE THEM. EVE THAT THE LAST INTER VICE PRESIDENT OF STUDENT AFFAIRS THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. NO WELL YEAH GONZALEZ DIRECTOR OF ADMISSIONS AND FINANCIAL AID CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY STANISLAUS. LARA MATTOON VICE CHANCELLOR FOR EXTERNAL RELATIONS CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRANCERS OFFICE AND THOMAS THE QUARTER DEAN OF FINANCIAL AID. AT USC WELCOME. AND I'VE EIGHT THEY WILL BEGIN WITH THE THAT. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU CHAIR MEDINA AND HER MCCARTY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR PERSPECTIVE ON FINANCIALLY REFORM. MY NAME IS THE BACK A LOT AND I AM THE INTERIM VICE PRESIDENT FOR STUDENT AFFAIRS AND VICE PROVOST FOR DIVERSITY IN ENGAGEMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. IN MY CAPACITY IN STUDENT AFFAIRS I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR FINANCIAL AID AT THE UC SYSTEM. IN MY CAPACITY AROUND ACCESS EQUITY INCLUSION I ALSO SEE HELP FINANCIALLY IMPACTS THE COLLEGE PIPELINE. TO PUT IN A MORE PERSONAL TERMS I SEE HOW GIFTED STUDENTS FOREGO THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE EDUCATION THEY DESERVE. BECAUSE OF FEARS OF COLLEGE COSTS COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY IS ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT TO CALIFORNIA FAMILIES AND TO THE WELL BEING OF OUR STATE. I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY STRESSING HOW CRITICAL CAL GRANTS ARE TO THE SUCCESSES WE HAVE HAD AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND MAINTAINING ACCESS FOR LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME STUDENTS AND I WANT TO JOIN THE CHORUS IN STATING THAT YOU SEE STUDENTS BENEFIT FROM ACCESS TO THE MOST SUCCESSFUL STATE GRANT PROGRAM IN THE NATION. THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM AS WELL AS A STE PROGRAM OUR OWN YOU SEE GRANTS WHICH IS WHY CRAP CAL GRANT REFORM HOLD SUCH PROMISE OF FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. ONE OF THE KEY PRINCIPLES THAT POLICYMAKERS ARE DISCUSSING IN THE CONTEXT OF CAL GRANT REFORM IS THE NEED TO ADDRESS THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE. AND WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE OUR FINANCIAL AID STRATEGY WHICH YOU'VE HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT TODAY IS CALLED THE EDUCATION FINANCING MODEL AND WE'VE TAKEN THE SERIOUSLY FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. IF YOU'LL TURN TO YOUR HAND OUT I'D LIKE TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO SLIDE. THREE WHERE WE EXPLAIN OUR PHILOSOPHY. WE BELIEVE THAT A PARTNERSHIP WITH PARENTS STUDENTS AS WELL AS STATE FEDERAL AND UNIVERSITY FINANCIAL AID CAN HELP STUDENTS FINANCE THEIR TOTAL COST COST OF ATTENDANCE. SLIDE FOUR SHOWS THE FUNDING THAT OUR STUDENTS RECEIVE FROM THREE CRITICAL SOURCES THE CAL GRANTS. OUR OWN UC GRANTS AND PELL GRANTS. IN TERMS OF TOTAL FUNDING CAL GRANTS PROVIDE THE MOST SUPPORT ABOUT NINE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. UC'S -- NEED BASED GRANT COMES IN SECOND AT ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION AND THE PELL GRANT FOR COMPARISON IS ABOUT HALF OF THAT ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION -- PERHAPS MORE MOST IMPORTANTLY SLIGHT FIVE SHOWS HOW THOSE FUNDS HELP STUDENTS COVER TUITION AND FEES OR OTHER EDUCATIONAL EXPENSES. AS YOU CAN SEE CAL GRANTS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR YOU SEE STUDENTS AND COVERING THEIR TUITION AND FEES WHICH IS WHY MAINTAINING THE FOCUS ON TUITION AND FEES GOES A LONG WAY. TO DOING NO HARM TO OUR STUDENTS. AND AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE SLIDE IF FEET IT FREES UP HELL GRANT AND OUR OWN YOU SEE GRANT FUNDING TO HELP OFFSET NON BE EDUCATIONAL COSTS THAT STUDENTS FACE. THIS IS WHY WE AGREE WITH THE RESOLUTIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE EIGHT COMMISSION AS ISSUED BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY THE RESOLUTION TO MAINTAIN AT A MINIMUM. COVERAGE OF TUITION AND FEES AT THE PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM. BUT CAL GRANT PROGRAM WAS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL IN KEEPING YOU SIX SENSIBLE TO LOW INCOME STUDENTS DURING AND FOLLOWING THE GREAT RECESSION. THIS IS BECAUSE CAL GRANT COVER TUITION AND FEE STUDENTS WHICH INCREASED DRAMATICALLY IN THOSE YEARS. I WANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT WE THINK THAT THE STATE HAS A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD ON THE EXISTING SUCCESS OF THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS WITHOUT A WHOLE SO RE ENGINEERING. FOR EXAMPLE SIMPLIFYING AND CONSOLIDATING THE PROGRAMS INCREASING THE CAL GRANT BE ACCESS AWARD. AND ELIMINATING THE BARRIERS FOR NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS ARE ALL GREAT THINGS TO DO AND WOULD HAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS. WE'RE ALSO VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE RECOMMENDATION TO EXPAND CAL GRANT INTO SUMMER SESSION. AT UC ARE CHRIS DIDN'T GRADUATE ON AVERAGE IN FOUR YEARS ADEQUATE AND AND AND A TERM -- SO IF THE STUDENTS COULD PULL TOGETHER A NEW YEAR ROUND HELL GRANT WITH THE SUMMER CAL GRANT THEY GRADUATE AND ENTER THE WORKFORCE EARLIER AND THAT WOULD FREE UP SPACE THAT YOU SEE IN THE FALL FOR ADDITIONAL CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WANTS TO BE YOUR PARTNERS IN HELPING STUDENTS MEET THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDING OUR INSTITUTIONS WE CAN BRING OUR OWN RESOURCES AND EXPERTISE AND WANT TO BE AT THE TABLE FOR THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU AND OTHERS. WE GET YOU SEE HAVE HAD GREAT SUCCESS IN A ROLLING LOW INCOME STUDENTS AS EVIDENCED BY THE SHARE WHO QUALIFY FOR FEDERAL PELL GRANTS. YOU CAN SEE IN FLIGHT SIX THAT WE FAR OUTPACE OTHER RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES IN THE COUNTRY. AND INSIGHT SEVEN YOU CAN SEE THAT WE ALSO HELP THEM GRADUATE WITH MEDICAL DEBT ON AVERAGE. BUT NO POLICY WHETHER IT'S AT THE STATE LEVEL OR AT THE LEVEL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CAN COVER EVERY STUDENT SITUATION. THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON TO PARTNER WITH US IN COVERING THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE IS THAT WE ARE WHERE THE STUDENTS ARE. WE CAN SIT WITH THE STUDENTS HEAR THEIR STORIES REVIEW THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS WERE POSSIBLE TO THEIR FINANCIAL AID PACKAGES. SO IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT CAL GRANT SO THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENT TO OUR SUCCESS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR EFFORTS TO EXPAND AND IMPROVE THE PROGRAMS AND WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSULTING WITH US ALONG THE WAY. THANK YOU [inaudible] NO IT. WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU CHAIRS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU TO MY HIGHER EDUCATION COLLEAGUES AND FELLOW? PANELISTS. I AM NO ALL THE GONZALEZ DIRECTOR OF ADMISSIONS AND FINANCIAL AID AT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY STANISLAUS. IT IS MY PLEASURE TO REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM HERE TODAY. I ALSO HAPPEN TO BE A MEMBER OF SEE SEX FINANCIAL AID ADVISORY BOARD. I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE LEGISLATURE AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE NEED COMMISSION FOR THEIR IMPORTANT WORK IN ASSESSING. CALIFORNIA'S FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS. AFFORDABILITY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE C. ISSUES MISSION OF PROVIDING ACCESS TO A HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION. FINANCIAL AID IS ONE OF THE SIX PILLARS OF OUR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND IT IS ESSENTIAL TO THE GOALS OF THAT INITIATIVE. TO IMPROVE DEGREE COMPLETION ELIMINATE EQUITY GAPS AND ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WORKFORCE NEEDS. WE ARE ENCOURAGED BY A NUMBER OF PROPOSED REFORMS THAT WOULD GREATLY BENEFIT STUDENTS AND FAMILIES WITH FINANCIAL NEED. AS WE HAVE EXAMINED THE FINANCIALLY PROPOSAL SUBMITTED UP TO THIS POINT WE HAVE BEEN GUIDED IN OUR ASSESSMENT BY A SET OF CORE PRINCIPLES WITCHER STAFF SUMMARIZED IN YOUR AGENDA. PLEASE PRINCIPLES INCLUDE. BUILT ON THE CAR GRANT SIX BUILDING KAGHAN SUCCESS AND DO NO HARM. CHANGES TO THE CAR GRANT PROGRAM SHOULD NOT RESULT IN A REDISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES AWAY FROM CATEGORIES OF STUDENTS WHO ALREADY QUALIFY. MAINTAIN CAL GRANTS CORE FOCUS ON TUITION COVERAGE THE COVER ON FOCUS ON COVERING TUITION FOR LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME STUDENTS HAS SERVED STUDENTS WHILE. IT ALSO SENDS A POWERFUL MESSAGE TO STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES IF YOU QUALIFY FOR CAL GRANT YOU WILL HAVE YOUR PUBLIC UNIVERSITY TUITION COVERED AT A MINIMUM. EXPAND THE REACH OF COG RATS THE CURRENT PROGRAMS INCLUDE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA THAT EXCLUDES MANY NEEDY STUDENTS. ELIMINATING UNNECESSARY BARRIERS FOR STUDENTS WOULD BE. HELPFUL FOR MANY NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS AND ESPECIALLY TRANSFER STUDENTS. A STAB ESTABLISH SUPPLEMENTAL SUMMER CAR GRANT ELIGIBILITY SUMMER ENROLLMENT HELP STUDENTS GRADUATE FASTER WHICH OPENS ENROLLMENT CAPACITY FOR OTHER STUDENTS. ALLOWING STUDENTS TO UTILIZE CAL GRANT IN THE SUMMER SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED WITH ADDITIONAL ENROLLMENT FUNDING SO THAT ACCESS IS MAINTAINED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. MAINTAIN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES FOCUS ON THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE. ADDRESSING THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE IS AN APPROPRIATE ASPECT OF FINANCIAL AID REFORM. ADDITIONALLY CAMPUSES SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE THE HUB FOR COORDINATING AND RESPONDING TO STUDENTS SHIFTING NEEDS OF THEIR THE ONLY ENTITY WERE ALL THE FINANCIALLY PIECES FIT TOGETHER. FEDERAL STATE AND INSTITUTIONAL AID. WITH THESE PRINCIPLES IN MIND WE'VE EVALUATED THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATIONS FOR REFORMING THE COG GRANT PROGRAM. AND OUR PLEASE THAT SEVERAL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS ALIGNED TO THE CORE PRINCIPLES I'VE JUST MENTIONED. FIRST IN REGARD TO ELIGIBILITY IN ACCESS BARRIERS WE SUPPORT EXPANDING CAL GRANT BE TUITION COVERAGE FOR THE FIRST YEAR AND ELIMINATING THE GAP LEFT BY THE INCOMING GPA REQUIREMENTS OF THE CAL GRANT A AND B.. THESE ARE COMMONSENSE CHANGES IN ELIMINATING UNNECESSARY BARRIERS WOULD HELP POTENTIAL TRANSFER STUDENTS ENROLLED AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN PARTICULAR AS WELL AS THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WITH SOME COLLEGE COMPLETED BUT NO DEGREE. ADDITIONALLY THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR THE HIGH SCHOOL ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM CURRENTLY REQUIRE STUDENTS TO BEGIN COLLEGE NO MORE THAN ONE YEAR AFTER GRADUATING. AND THE TRANSFER ENTITLEMENT REQUIRE STUDENTS TO BE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY EIGHT THIS IS AN OUTDATED MODEL THAT DOES NOT SERVE CSU STUDENTS. MANY OF WHOM DO NOT FIT INTO THE EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD CATEGORY VERY WELL. SECONDLY WE AGREE THAT THE FOCUS OF FINANCIAL AID SHOULD BE ON THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE AND IT SHOULD MAINTAIN FULL COVERAGE OF TUITION AND FEES. STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES SHOULD KNOW THAT IF THEY QUALIFY FOR ACOG GRANT. THEY WILL AT LEAST HAVE THEIR TUITION COVERED. EVEN WHEN TUITION INCREASES ARE NECESSARY NECESSITATED. THROUGH DICK DECREASE STATE SUPPORT DURING HARD ECONOMIC TIMES. WE FULLY RECOGNIZE THAT TUITION IS FOR FACED BY STUDENTS. OUR CAMPUSES PACKAGE FINANCIAL AID BASED UPON THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE AND THE TOTAL COST OF INCLUDE BOOKS ROOM AND BOARD AND TRANSPORTATION. THE FIND THE COVER NOT BE AXIS AWARD SHOULD BE INCREASED IN ORDER TO BETTER ADDRESS THE TOTAL COST FACED BY OUR STUDENTS BEYOND TUITION. THIRD WE ALSO SUPPORT A SUPPLEMENTAL SUMMER CAL GRANT. FACILITATING SOMEONE ROOM IT WILL HELP STUDENTS GRADUATE MORE QUICKLY THEREBY LOWERING THE TOTAL COST AND STUDENT BARRING ASSOCIATED WITH ACHIEVING A DEGREE. AND ALSO OPEN ENROLLMENT SPACE FOR ADDITIONAL CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. THEY SHOULD BE SUPPORTED THROUGH THE EXPANSION OF CAL GRANT FUNDING. FINALLY WE AGREE WITH THE PERSPECTIVE NOTED IN THE COMMITTEE AGENDA THAT MAJOR CHANGES TO THE CAR GRANT PROGRAM SHOULD BE PHASED IN OVER SEVERAL YEARS. I'D LIKE TO CONCLUDE WITH A FEW CAUTIONARY NOTES. CHANGES TO THE CAR GRANT PROGRAM SHOULD NOT RESULT IN A REDISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES AWAY FROM CATEGORIES OF STUDENTS WHO ALREADY QUALIFY. UNIFORM WORK EXPECTATION FAMILY CONTRIBUTION WOULD BE HARMFUL TO OUR STUDENTS. THEY ARE ALREADY WORKING HARD TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES AND EARNED A DEGREE. AND WE BELIEVE THAT MOVING TO A MODEL THAT FIRST FACTORS AND EXPECTED CONTRIBUTIONS AND THE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WOULD ONLY HURT STUDENTS WHO ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING. LASTLY WE URGE THAT ANY INCREASES IN THE BREATH OF FINANCIAL AID MUST BE PAIRED WITH INCREASES TO INSTITUTIONAL FUNDING. AS THE DEMAND FOR A CSU EDUCATION INCREASES TO TO REMOVING BARRIERS TO FINANCIAL AID. THE DEMAND FOR ENROLLMENT WILL INEVITABLY NEED TO INCREASE AS WELL. WITHOUT A CONSCIOUS PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN AND WILL MAKE FUNDING AND ACCESS TO FINANCIAL AID WE WILL ALL BE MAKING A HOLLOW PROMISE TO STUDENTS. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SHARE THE CS USE PERSPECTIVE ON FINANCIALLY REFORM WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO BE PART OF THIS CONVERSATION MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU THIS MEANT. TO GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEDINA CHAIR MCCARTY AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M LARA MATTOON VICE CHANCELLOR OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES FOR EXTERNAL RELATIONS. THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. UP AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR ON GOING LEADERSHIP ON THIS REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE. I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT A COLLEGE CREDENTIAL IS INCREASINGLY THE KEY FOR CALIFORNIANS TO UNLOCK SOCIAL MOBILITY AND ECONOMIC PROSPERITY. A STUDENT'S ABILITY TO AFFORD THE TUITION AND NON TUITION COSTS OF COLLEGE PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN THEIR DECISION TO ATTEND. AND THEIR ABILITY TO GRADUATE. THE MASTER PLAN FOR HIGHER EDUCATION PROVIDES A DEEP COMMITMENT TO COLLEGE ACCESS. BUT IT REINFORCES TOO DEEPLY CONCERNING INEQUITIES. FIRST COMMUNITY COLLEGES SERVE THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS BUT WE RECEIVE THE LOWEST PER STUDENT FUNDING LEVEL OF ANY SYSTEM OF EDUCATION IN THE STATE. AND SECOND THE STATE'S FINANCIAL AID POLICIES REINFORCED OUTDATED STEREOTYPES. ABOUT TRADITIONAL COLLEGE STUDENTS VANTAGE'S TODAY'S COLLEGE STUDENTS AND IT PROVIDES LITTLE AID TO MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS LIKE FOOD AND HOUSING. WITH NEARLY TWO POINT TWO MILLION STUDENTS THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES REPRESENT THE LARGEST SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE COUNTRY. THE VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS STUDENTS. MOST FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS MOST STUDENTS OF COLOR WILL BEGIN THEIR AT HIGHER EDUCATION JOURNEY AT ONE OF THE STATE'S HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN COLLEGES. WERE THE LARGEST WORKFORCE EDUCATION PROVIDER. AND WE HAVE A MAJOR ROLE IN TRANSFER PREPARATION IN FACT 51% OF CSU GRADUATES AND 29% OF YOU SEE GRADUATES ALSO ATTENDED A CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE ON THE PATHWAY. POLICY MAKERS IN THE STATE HAVE WORKED VERY HARD TO ENSURE THAT TUITION IS NOT A BARRIER FOR STUDENTS IN OUR SYSTEM AND WE SHOULD CELEBRATE THAT WORK THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE GRANT WHICH WAS FORMERLY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS FEE WAIVER. PAYS TUITION FOR ALL STUDENTS WITH FINANCIAL NEED. NEARLY ONE MILLION STUDENTS HAVE THEIR TUITION WAVED EVERY YEAR. LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE FUNDED THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE WHICH PROVIDES TUITION COVERAGE FOR UP TO ONE YEAR. FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT MEET THOSE TRADITIONAL LOW INCOME STANDARDS BUT ARE ABLE TO ATTEND FIRST TIME AND FULL TIME THAT'S ABOUT ANOTHER TWENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS. AND FOR THOSE STUDENTS WHO DO NOT QUALIFY FOR EITHER THE PROMISE GRANT FOR THE PROMISE PROGRAM. THEY BENEFIT FROM THE LOWEST FEES OF ANY COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM IN THE NATION THEY PAY LESS THAN FOURTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO ATTEND FULL TIME. BUT THE TOTAL COST TO ATTEND A CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS MUCH MUCH MORE THAN TUITION. COSTS LIKE FOOD HOUSING AND TEXT BOOKS CAN EXCEED NINETEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY. AND BECAUSE SO LITTLE GRANT AID IS AVAILABLE TO COVER THOSE NON TUITION COSTS. AT A CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE IT CAN OFTEN BE LESS AFFORDABLE FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS TO ATTEND AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. IN THEIR REGION THAN THE UNIVERSITY OF WE NEED TO CORRECT THIS INEQUITY. FINANCIAL AID IS A KEY COMPONENT OF STUDENT SUCCESS AS HEART HAS ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED THIS MORNING. AND IN RECOGNIZING THAT IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN OUR BOARD OF GOVERNORS VOTED TO REQUEST A ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA'S FINANCIAL AID STRUCTURE. UNDER THE PROPOSAL NEW FINANCIAL AID WOULD BE DIRECTED BASED ON THREE PRINCIPLES. FIRST ALL CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WITH FINANCIAL NEED SHOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE FINANCIAL AID. REGARDLESS OF THEIR AGE THE TIME OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL FOR THEIR HIGH SCHOOL ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE. SECOND A STUDENT FINANCIAL AID SHOULD BE LINKED TO THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE NOT JUST TUITION AND FEES BUT ALSO COSTS LIKE FOOD HOUSING TRANSPORTATION AND SUPPLIES. AND THIRD A STUDENT SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO FINANCIAL AID REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY'RE SEEKING A TRANSFER OR A HIGH QUALITY SHORT TERM CAREER PROGRAM OFFEREDAT ONE OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THIS YEAR OUR SYSTEM IS SPONSORING SENATE BILL TWO NINETY ONE TO CREATE THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM. IT'S REMARKABLY SIMILAR TO THE PROGRAM DESCRIBED BY IT -- MISTER CHAIRMAN FROM THE CENTURY FOUNDATION IT WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE. AN ADD ON AWARD FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS THE PROGRAM WOULD PROVIDE A COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT WITH A NEW GRANT LINK TO THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE WANTED ACCOUNTS FOR THE GIFTED THEY ALREADY RECEIVE AND THE RESOURCES THEY HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE. THIS AID WOULD HELP STUDENTS ELIMINATE LOAN DEBT AND REDUCE EXCESSIVE WORK HOURS GIVING THEM THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO COMPLETE THEIR PROGRAMS ON TIME. IN ORDER TO PARTICIPATE COLLEGES WOULD BE REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES THAT SUPPORT STUDENT SUCCESS SUCCESSFUL STUDENT OUTCOMES PRACTICES LIKE DUAL ENROLLMENT. EARLY OUT REACHED A HIGH SCHOOLS FATSO COMPLETION BASIC SKILLS REFORMS AND GUIDED PATHWAYS. SB TWO NINETY ONE ENTERS A MEANINGFUL COMMITMENT TO COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY BY PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO STUDENTS WITH THE GREATEST FINANCIAL NEED. I WANT TO THANK SENATOR LABOR FOR INTRODUCING THE BILL AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM FOR BEING A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR OF THE MEASURE. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS PROPOSAL WORKS IN TANDEM WITH THE BROADER FINANCIAL AID REFORM CONVERSATION THAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS COMMITTEE. OUR PRIORITY IS TO ENSURE THAT ALL RENTS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACCEPT TO ATTEND AND SUCCEED IN COLLEGE. NO MATTER WHERE IN OUR PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM THEY BEGIN THEIR JOURNEY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. THIS RECORD. HI GOOD MORNING SERVER CARTUJA MEDINA THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK THIS MORNING MY NAME IS THOMAS RECORDER ON DEAN OF FINANCIAL AID AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN HIGHER EDUCATION FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS AND I'M PROUD TO BE HERE THIS MORNING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. OF OVER TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND CAL GRANT RECIPIENTS WHO ATTEND AN INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT INSTITUTION IN CALIFORNIA IN THE SCHOOLS THAT SUPPORT THEM. AS A NATIVE CALIFORNIAN RAISED IN BAKERSFIELD I BECAME AWARE OF CALIFORNIA'S MASTER PLAN FOR EDUCATION. WHEN CAL STATE BAKERSFIELD WELCOME ITS FIRST STUDENTS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ASSURING THE PUBLIC EDUCATION WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO AN EXPANDING AREA OF THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY? I ATTENDED PUBLIC SCHOOLS ONE ON TWITTER ON UNIVERSITY OF REDLANDS OR TO GRADUATE FROM USC. WHAT MAKES THE KALRA UNIQUE IS THAT IT WAS ESTABLISHED AT A TIME WHEN CALIFORNIA WAS GROWING COULD NOT CURING TO ALL ELIGIBLE STUDENTS ACCESS TO THE PUBLIC SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION? CREATION OF THE CAL GRANT INSURED STUDENTS ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY AND HIGHER EDUCATION. THE MASTER PLAN SUPPORTED THE DEMAND FOR HIGHER EDUCATION AND A WAY TO MANAGE THE INVESTMENT IN THE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND WELL BEING OF CALIFORNIANS. IT ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT SECTOR SHOULD AND WOULD PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE STATE'S HER EDUCATION PATH. THAT STORY CONTINUES TO BE TRUE TODAY. THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE FOR YOUR PUBLIC AND THE PRIVATE NONPROFIT SECTORS. HELPS TO CREATE EFFICIENT INVESTMENT OF TAX DOLLARS WHILE LEVERAGING THE CAPACITY IN SUPPORT OFFERED IN THE INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT SECTOR. IT ALLOW STUDENTS TO ATTEND THE COLLEGE OR YOU THAT IS THE BEST FIT FOR THEM ACADEMICALLY FINANCIALLY. AND WHAT'S WILL PROVIDE THE SUPPORT NECESSARY FOR THEIR SUCCESS. AS WE ALL KNOW THE COST OF COLLEGE CONTINUES TO INCREASE AND STUDENT SUPPORT IS CRITICAL. MUCH OF OUR DISCUSSION TODAY REVOLVES AROUND ON TUITION EXPENSES SUCH AS BOOKS AND SUPPLIES ROOM BOARD AND OTHERS THAT ARE CONSIDERED EDUCATIONAL COSTS FOR THE PURPOSES OF NEED BASED FINANCIAL IT. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE STUDENTS NON TWITCHING COSTS ARE SIMILAR IN EVERY SECTOR. THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCES IN THE TUITION COSTS WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY TUITION AND ELEMENT AND GIVES OF THE INDEPENDENT SECTOR AND TAXPAYER SUBSIDIES AND EXTERNAL SUPPORT IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. WE ALSO KNOW THAT A LOW INCOME STUDENT IS A LOW INCOME STUDENT NO MATTER WHERE THEY A TON TO CHOOSE COLLEGE. THEIR SOCIAL ECONOMIC REALITY IN CHALLENGES FOLLOW THEM WHEREVER THEY ATTENDED I ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT. THE IMPROVEMENTS DISCUSSED TODAY IN THE CONTEXT OF TREATING ALL STUDENTS EQUITABLY. AND ENSURING THAT WITH ANY CHANGES WE SEEK TO BUILD UPON THE STRENGTH OF THE COBRA PROGRAM AND DO NO HARM TO STUDENTS. OUR SECTOR INVESTS HEAVILY IN OUR STUDENTS AND ON ROMAN A FLOOD REFLECTS THE DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. WE SPEND APPROXIMATELY TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN INSTITUTIONAL EIGHT EACH YEAR PROVIDING AN AVERAGE OF NINETEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN INSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS TO EACH KALRA RECIPIENT. WE STRIVE TO MAINTAIN FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS THE BALANCE LOAN AND WORK WITH BROWN'S. CALIFORNIA STUDENTS GRADUATE WITH APPROXIMATELY TWENTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN STUDENT AT A GRADUATION PLACING US FORTIETH IN THE NATION. AT US SUIT THE AVERAGE STUDENT -- KILL SLIGHTLY LOWER AT ABOUT TWENTY TWO THOUSAND THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SECTOR OF WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY. TWENTY NINE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED OUR SECTORS FOUR YEAR AVERAGE GRADUATION RATE IS 61%. AND AT USC OR SECURE RATE IS 92%. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT OUR FOREIGN SECURE GRADUATION RATES FOR CAL GRANT RECIPIENTS IS HIGHER THAN THE OVERALL AVERAGE. WHEN STUDENTS GRADUATE EARLIER THE COST TO REDUCE THEY BORROW US AND THEY'RE ABLE TO ENTER THE WORK FORCE SOONER WITH THEIR NEW EARNING POTENTIAL? WHILE IT IS TRUE THE CALIFORNIA HAS LONG BEEN CONSIDERED A LEADER IN THE NATION IN HIGHER EDUCATION THE PROMISE OF EQUAL OPPORTUNITY IS THE ROAD AND AS WE SEE ISSUES IN COLLEGE COMPLETION AN ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION. FOR OUR LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS. THE CALVET WRONG GETS GROANING COMPLEXITY IS NOT SERVING ALL STUDENTS AS WELL AS IT SHOULD. WITH THE RECENT ECONOMIC GROWTH OF OUR STATE AND A STABLE BUDGET THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO EVALUATE EVALUATE OUR POLICIES. AT A HIGHER LEVEL AND CONSIDER THE TIME RIGHT FOR MAJOR REFORM. WE SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL TO REINSTITUTE A FORMULA FOR DETERMINING THE CAL GRANT AWARD FOR STUDENTS ATTEND AN INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT SCHOOLS. THERE'S BEEN NO INCREASE IN ALMOST TWENTY YEARS EQUATING TO NEARLY 50% REDUCTION OF PURCHASING POWER. EACH YEAR FUNDING HAS BEEN VULNERABLE AS THE BUDGET PROCESS UNFOLDS AT A TIME THAT STUDENTS NEED TO KNOW WHAT SUPPORT THEY WILL RECEIVE AND CREATING UNCERTAINTY FOR STUDENTS AND THE INSTITUTIONS THAT SORT OF THEM. THE LACK OF PREDICTABILITY AND DECLINING VALUE MAKE IT LESS ATTRACTIVE TO FAMILIES AND AFFECTS THE CHOICES THEY MAKE. THIS HAS AN IMPACT ON THE AROMA OF THE STUDENTS OUR SECTOR WHERE THERE IS CAPACITY TO SUPPORT AND SORT OF THEM. FOR EXAMPLE SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE THE CSU HAS SEEN A TWO HUNDRED AND 27% INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CAL GRANT RECIPIENTS. UC AT A HUNDRED AND 6% WHILE THE PERCENTAGE OF CAL GRANT RECIPIENTS AT I CC YOU INSTITUTIONS HAS INCREASE JUST WE BELIEVE THAT ARBITRARY BARRIERS TO CAL GRANT AWARDS WILL BE ADDRESS SUCH AS AGING TIME OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND DIFFERENT GPA AND INCOME AND ALSO QUALIFICATIONS. OVER THE LAST DECADE DEMAND FOR COMPETITIVE CAL GRANTS IS INCREASED BY OVER 2100% WHILE THE NUMBER OFFERED HAS ONLY INCREASED 14%. STEPS WILL BE TAKEN TO SIMPLIFY THE CAL GRANT TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR STUDENTS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE. EXAMPLES ARE THE DIFFERENCES AND CAL GRANT AMD QUALIFICATION OUT AN ALTERNATIVE METHODS OVER FEDERAL METHODOLOGY TO TO TERMINATE. AND RESTRICTING AWARDS TO TUITION ONLY. FOR INSTANCE SOME OF OUR ROTC EVEN VETERANS BENEFITS WHICH MEET THEIR TUITION COSTS SO THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO RECEIVE A CAGR OUT WHICH THEY MAY BE QUALIFIED. FOR EXPANDING ELIGIBILITY TO SUMMER COULD HELP STUDENTS STAY ON TRACK TO GRADUATE ON TIME OR EVEN AHEAD OF TIME. ALLOWING THEM TO REDUCE THEIR EDUCATIONAL EXPENSES AND OUGHT TO LAY AND IN THE WORK FORCE. WITH THE RETURN OF YOUR OWN CALL THE SUPPORT COULD BE INVALUABLE. AS MENTIONED EARLIER WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS FOR ALL OF THEIR EDUCATIONAL EXPENSES NOT JUST TUITION SUPPORT. UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENT METHODS OF EVALUATING THE IT AND AWARDING A WILL SYSTEM PROVIDING POLICY MAKERS WITH A CLEARER UNDERSTANDING OF THE CHALLENGES THAT STUDENTS FAIRS. I HOPE THIS DISCUSSION HAS BEEN HELPFUL TO AND THAT YOU CAN SEE HOW OUR STUDENTS WOULD BENEFIT FROM A FUNDING FORMULA. IT WOULD PROVIDE PREDICTABILITY THAT WOULD REDUCE ANXIETY OVER FUTURE FUNDING AND A STATEMENT OF EQUITY FOR STUDENTS THAT THEY ARE VALUED EQUALLY IN OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. ASSURING THEM THAT IS THE STATE INCREASES INVESTMENT IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR THERE WOULD ALSO BE MODEST GROWTH IN THE STATE'S INVESTMENT AND THEIR SUCCESS. AND IT WOULD ALLOW THE STUDENTS THE ABILITY TO ACCESS THE INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY OF OUR INSTITUTIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU. THAT QUESTION TO THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE YOU SEE AN AND CSU A REGARDING SUMMER SCHOOL -- IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I'VE BEEN IN SCHOOL SO I I HAVE A QUESTION. IS SUMMER SCHOOL MORE EXPENSIVE TO STUDENTS NOW. IS THE COST OF ATTENDING SUMMER SESSION MORE THAN THE NORMAL OTHER -- SEMESTERS OR QUARTERS TO THEM OR IS IT [inaudible] THE SAME. A FOR THE CSU IT'S ALMOST THE SAME. IT'S REALLY BASED ON HOW MANY STUDENTS ARE HOW MANY UNITS EACH OF THE STUDENTS ARE TAKING. A BIT OF THEIRMOST STUDENTS TAKE ABOUT SIX UNITS EACH SUMMER AND IT'S ROUGHLY ABOUT THE SAME COST OF THE REGULARS MASTER IN TERMS OF FEES. AND FOR THE UC FOR USE IT'S ABOUT THE SAME AGAIN IT'S BY CREDIT HOURS OF THE COSTS ARE DETERMINED DIFFERENTLY BUT IT'S MORE OR LESS THE SAME. COMPARABLE COMPARABLE. AND AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW STUDENTS ARE NOT ABLE TO USE CAL GRANTS OF FOR SUMMER SCHOOL ATTENDANCE I CORRECT. WHAT THE STUDENTS BECAUSE -- HAVE ATTENDED THE FLU THE YEAR PRIOR FOR EXAMPLE AT THE VIEWSTER OUT THERE ARE YEARS ALLOCATION OF CAL GRANT ALREADY -- AND SO THEY HAVE THE FOUR YEARS OF CAL GRANT ELIGIBILITY IF WITH THEIR TEETH DURING THE SUMMER IT WOULD TAKE AWAY FROM THE FOUR YEARS SO THEY WOULDN'T IF THEY USE IT IN THE SUMMER THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO USE IT. FOR THE REST OF IT WITH A FOUR YEARS HERE FUTURE ELIGIBILITY WRECKED AND SO IT DO YOU HAVE A RECOMMENDATION AS TO HOW MANY. SEMESTERS OF QUARTERS -- WE SHOULD GRANT THEM STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO USE -- CAL GRANTS THAT TAKING SUMMER CLASSES. WHAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FOR STUDENTS ARE GRADUATING IN FOUR YEARS ON AVERAGE WITH AN ADDITIONAL TERM? THEN A SUMMER OF CAL GRANT WOULD HELP THEM GET INTO THE JOB FORCE IN INTO THE INTO THE WORK FORCE EARLIER SO IT WOULD CERTAINLY BENEFIT OUR STUDENTS -- AND ENCOURAGE THEIR EARLIER GRADUATION WHICH WOULD FREE UP SPACE IN THE FALL. FOR NEW FOR NEW UC STUDENTS BECAUSE OUR STUDENTS WOULD NOT THEN BE ENROLLED IN FALL AND FALL TERM THREE RECOMMENDATION FROM YOU SEE WOULD BE JUST THE ONE ONE TIME. AT A MINIMUM THAT'S ADDITIVE -- AND FROM CSU. SO WE HAVEN'T LOOKED AT IT VERY CLOSELY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION SPECIFICALLY BUT FROM MY EXPERIENCE -- WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE I WOULD LIKE TO THINK. THREE FROM THREE SUMMER TERMS. SO STUDENT WITH BE ABLE TO ATTEND EACH SUMMER BETWEEN THEIR FRESHMAN AND SOPHOMORE YEAR THEIR SOPHOMORE AND JUNIOR. IN JUNIOR AND SENIOR SO THREE TERMS IT'S SIMILAR TO WHAT THE PROGRAM THE FEDERAL PROGRAM IS DOING NOW. HAD THANK YOU. FAN AND I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE -- THE THE IMPORTANCE OF A PRIVATE NON PROFIT SCHOOLS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT THE GREAT JOB THAT THEY DO AND THAT YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE -- LIKE PART TIME FACULTY -- YOU KNOW OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES WOULD NOT EXIST IT WERE NOT FOR PART TIME FACULTY -- THAT CALIFORNIA WOULD NOT HAVE THE EXCELLENT -- HIGHER EDUCATION A SYSTEM THAT WE DO WERE IT NOT FOR THE THE PRIVATES -- AND I AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I VERY MUCH WANT TO SEE WOULD YOU RECOMMENDED. THAT WE PUT IN A FORMULA SO THAT THE THE THE PRIVATES DON'T HAVE TO COME BACK. EVERY YEAR TO KEEP PACE WITH THE CAL GRANT SO I I HOPE AS WE MOVE FORWARD THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE THAT. UP IN THIS BEEN THAT WOULD BE MY RECOMMENDATION. YEAH JUST -- JUST ADD ON WHAT YOU SAID MISTER MEDINA ON THE THE SUMMER SCHOOL ISSUE I I THINK THAT'S A GREAT IDEA. AND IT REALLY ADDRESSES TO ISSUES ADDRESSES FINANCIAL AID AND STUDENTS BUT ALSO THE ISSUE WERE TRYING. TO GET AT WITH CSU AND THEIR GRAD. AND YOU KNOW SUMMER IS A BIG ISSUE IN SELF WE GET STUDENTS GOING TO SUMMER MORE. WE GET THE GRADUATING IN A FASTER PER OF TIME AND OPEN UP THOSE CSU CHAIRS FOR THAT THREE THOUSAND STUDENTS WHO CAN'T GET INSULTS AT WIN WIN WIN -- ALL THE WAY AROUND I KNOW THIS THIS TO DATE COMMISSION MISTER O'BRIEN DID YOU HAVE A DO YOU HAVE A A NUMBER AS FAR AS WHAT THAT WOULD. FOR THAT WOULD COST YOU COME ON SURE SCHOOL YEAH IF WE IF WE HAD MISTER LEVINE WAS HERE EARLIER HAD A HE HAD A BILL ON THIS LAST YEAR WITH YOUR COMMITTEE SO IT'S IT IT'S NOT A NEW IDEA THAT GOOD -- ONE SO WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD COST -- IT IT DEPENDS ON THE FORMULA BUT THE LEGISLATION THAT'S BEEN INTRODUCED FOR STILL COSTING IT OUT. VARIOUS VERSIONS OF PREVIOUS LEGISLATION WE'VE COSTED IT ANYWHERE FROM. TWENTY TO FORTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR -- WE'RE STILL WORKING ON THE CURRENT ONE YES SO JUST BE KIND OF LIKE UP PLUS THE CAL GRANT PLUS WE GIVE THEM. YOU KNOW THEY GET CREDIT FOR UP TO YOU KNOW. FOR FIVE CLASSES THROUGHOUT THEIR CAREER DURING THE SUMMER SOMETHING LIKE YEAH YEAH A IN A LOT OF IT DEPENDS ON THE IMPACT TO STUDENTS -- ENROLLMENT SO. WE CAN RUN THE GOAL OF THE LEGISLATION SEE MORE STUDENTS INTO THE COURSES THAN. THOSE OBVIOUSLY GO UP BUT WE'VE LOOKED AT VARIOUS VERSIONS THAT IN THAT -- I BELIEVE TWENTY TO FIFTY MILLION I'M JUST CHRIS WAS THERE OF AND IT WAS A BILL LAST USER A BILL AGAIN THIS YEAR INTRODUCED ON THE TOPIC. YES I BELIEVE THERE HAS BEEN RUBIO. OKAY AND THEN FOR FOR UC AND CSU I I KNOW IT'S SOMEWHAT CONTROVERSIAL BUT WHATDO YOU THINK ABOUT THE PRIOR. NOW WE TALKED ABOUT THAT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION YOU KNOW ROUGHLY INTEREST SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR EACH OF THE TWO SEGMENTS THAT. IS YEAR YOUR AGE I MEAN IT'S NOT YOU IT'S HAS STEERED YOUR STUDENTS PAYING. A THIRD OF THEIR WALTER PAY THE TUITION A THIRD OF IT GOES BACK. TO EIGHT AND SOME HAVE HOW HAVING MORE COORDINATION IN A POTENTIALLY HAVE IT GO THROUGH ONE ENTITY. TO TO STREAMLINE AND MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT. WHAT DO YOU THINK FROM THE SEGMENTS ABOUT THAT? THANK YOU FOR THAT FOR THAT QUESTION OF I SO AS WE AS WE STATED THE THE THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE THAT A STUDENT GETS. COMES TO A CAMPUS IT IS IT IS LOCALLY PACKAGE AND SO. THE COLLABORATION COORDINATION DATA SHARING BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE AND THE CAMPUSES WITH RESPECT TO THAT. IS WHICH WOULD BE HELPFUL AND IT WOULD HELP US ALL MAKE BETTER DECISIONS BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY ALL THE OTHER FORMS OF AID ARE AT THE CAMPUS LEVEL AND THAT'S WHERE STUDENTS ARE AND THAT'S WHERE DECISIONS HAVE TO BE MADE. AND SO WE COULD WE COULD ENVISION BETTER COLLABORATION BETTER -- DATA SHARING WITH US FOR PACKAGING REMAINING WITH THE WITH THE SEGMENTS AND WITH THE WITH THE CAMPUSES. AN ARM TO MUCH FOR THE CSU WE ARE IT'S MORE OF A WAIVER PROGRAMS HAS SAID THE FEES FOR THAT THOSE STUDENTS -- ALTHOUGH THERE IS A VALUE TO IT BECAUSE WERE WAVING A FEE -- IT'S IT'S MORE OF A WAIVER PROGRAM SO THERE ISN'T YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF A POT OF CASH ANYWHERE.

CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT -- COLLEGES TO COME TO THE TABLE. AND AS THEY'RE COMING I WILL INTRODUCE THEM. CAROLINE SIEGEL SAYING. PRESIDENT OF THE UC STUDENT ASSOCIATION. MIA COULD SHE OWNERS PRESIDENT OF THE CSU. AND I APOLOGIZE PRESIDENT OF THE CSU STUDENT ASSOCIATION DANNY. THIRD CALL LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS DIRECTOR. REGION TO STUDENT SENATE OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND NAY THE NOON YES FROM MRS -- PACIFIC UNIVERSITY WELCOME ALL. AND WE WILL BEGIN WITH CAROLINE FROM THE UC STUDENT ASSOCIATION. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU TO COMMITTEE LEADERSHIP FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM FOR YOU SEE STUDENTS. AND ALSO FOR MAKING SURE THAT STAND VOICE IS A PART OF TODAY'S HEARING AND THE POLICY MAKING PROCESS IT'S VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. AS THE CURRENT THIRD YEAR AT UC SAN DIEGO THE CAL GRANT IN COMBINATION WITH THE FEDERAL PELL GRANT AND A GENEROUS INSTITUTIONAL AID PROGRAM. HAS MEANT THAT I AM ABLE TO ATTEND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT PAYING THE COST OF TUITION. ROUGHLY 56% OF OUR STUDENTS ARE IN THE SAME SITUATION. THE CAL GRANT HAS AFFORDED THE OPPORTUNITY TO STUDENTS AT ALL THREE INSTITUTIONS SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE AS THE CALIFORNIA STATE SCHOLARSHIP. ESSENTIALLY SAYS THAT CALIFORNIA SEES THEM AND THEIR EDUCATION AS AN INVESTMENT. I THINK THE REFORM PROCESS ALLOWS US THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND THIS PROMISE TO ADDRESS THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE AS WELL. TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THREE CONCERNS WITH THE CURRENT PROGRAM THAT I'M HOPING CAN BE ADDRESSED IN THE REFORM PROCESS. THE FIRST BEING BETTER SUPPORT FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS ONCE THEY ENTER OUR INSTITUTION. SECOND BEING A SUMMER CAL GRANT TO INCREASE TIME TO COMPLETION. AND THE THIRD BEING THE INCLUSION OF UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS INTO OUR STATE AID PROGRAM. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THE GENEROUS ONE THIRD RETURN TO AID MODEL MEANS THAT STUDENTS WHO WOULD QUALIFY FOR CAL GRANT. BUT ARE EXCLUDED FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS SUCH AS BEING OVER THE AGE OF TWENTY EIGHT TAKING MORE THAN A YEAR OFF AFTER HIGH SCHOOL. AND US SOMETHING EVEN AS SIMPLE AS TURNING IN THEIR AFTER THE MARCH SECOND DEADLINE. MEANS THAT THEY ARE NOW NOT ABLE TO RECEIVE THE STATE CAL GRANT HOWEVER THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA USES ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS OF OUR INSTITUTIONAL AID. TO BACK FILL THESE GENTS FINANCIAL AID -- PACKAGES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING WITHOUT. TOO MANY TRANSFER STUDENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT PROVIDED IN THE CURRENT CAL GRANT PROGRAM AND I THINK THAT SENDS A MESSAGE THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOES NOT SEE THOSE STRANDS AS WORTHY OF THE SAME INVESTMENT AND IT'S REALLY UNFORTUNATE I HOPE THAT CHANGES SOON. TO QUICKLY PUT NUMBERS TO THE ISSUE THERE ARE ROUGHLY TWENTY THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED STUDENTS AT UC. WHO WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR RECEIVING THE GRANT IF WE WERE TO FOLLOW THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATIONS APPROVED IN NOVEMBER? BY JUST ELIMINATING THE AGE REQUIREMENT OF TWENTY EIGHT WE COULD PROVIDE AID TO AN ADDITIONAL ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED STUDENTS AT UC. THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF WHO IS PURSUING HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE STATE IS RAPIDLY CHANGING I KNOW THAT IN THE LAST FEW YEARS THE LEGISLATURE HAS PLACED AN EMPHASIS ON MAINTAINING A TWO TO ONE TRANSFER RATIO. AT THE UC. THIS MEANS IT NOW MORE THAN EVER THE INSTITUTION IS AND ROLLING AND NEEDING TO PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR THIS POPULATION. TO SUPPORT THEIR SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION. WE NEED TO EXPAND THE CURRENT PROGRAM BEYOND COVERING JUST THE COST OF TUITION AND LOOK AT COVERING THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE. POSSIBLY THROUGH AN INCREASE TO THE ACCESS AWARD. TODAY TUITION ONLY ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT A THIRD OF STUDENTS COST OF ATTENDANCE IN THE UC. AND SOME OF THE LARGEST BARRIERS TO OUR STUDENTS TODAY ESPECIALLY LOW INCOME STUDENTS. ARE THE NON TUITION COSTS SUCH AS FOOD AND HOW. CONCERNING NUMBERS OF STUDENTS ON OUR CAMPUSES ARE STRUGGLING WITH HOMELESSNESS AND BASIC NEED SECURITY AND SECURITY. OUR STUDENTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO AFFORD BASIC NEEDS. LAST SUMMER I WAS ABLE. TO TAKE SUMMER COURSES AT UC SAN DIEGO AND SO THROUGH THE INSTITUTIONAL AID. I RECEIVED ROUGHLY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS WITH THE FEDERAL PELL GRANT PROGRAM BEING A NEWLY APPROVED YEAR ROUND PROGRAM I RECEIVED ROUGHLY. NINE HUNDRED FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THAT COVERED TUITION. AND LEFT ME WITH. MAYBE TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR EVERY OTHER COST ASSOCIATED WITH ATTENDING SCHOOL THAT SUMMER. CURRENTLY STUDENTS CANNOT BE AWARDED CAL GRANT FOR THE SUMMER SESSIONS. BECAUSE A WOULD ESSENTIALLY REMOVE ONE OF THEIR ELIGIBILITY DURING THEIR SENIOR YEAR. FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE A STUDENT AT UC BERKELEY AND YOU CHOSE TO USE YOUR CAL GRANT DURING THE SUMMER. YOUR SENIOR YEAR LAST SEMESTER YOU WOULD SUDDENLY BE AN ELIGIBLE. THAT PROVIDES AN ISSUE FOR A LOT OF OUR STUDENTS. TAKING SUMMER SESSIONS ENSURES THAT STUDENTS ARE LESS LIKELY TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL AND GET THEIR DEGREE FASTER. HELLO GRANT RECIPIENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAVE A SIX YEAR GRADUATION RATE OF 72%. FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT ENROLL IN SUMMER. HOWEVER WHEN YOU TAKE OUT -- OUT IN ONE ADDITIONAL SUMMER CHIU THAT GOES UP 286%. WHEN STUDENTS TAKE TWO SUMMER TERMS IT GOES UP 291%? YEAH BY PROVIDING A SUMMER CAL GRANT THIS WOULD FREE UP INSTITUTIONAL AID TO ALSO HELP COVER THE NON TUITION COSTS DURING THE SUMMER. ADDITIONALLY INCREASE INCREASING THE CAL GRANT BE ACCESS AWARD WOULD ALSO HELP WITH THESE NON TUITION COSTS. MY LAST POINT THAT I WOULD LIKE. TO SAY IS THAT THE CAL GRANT ALSO NEEDS TO BE EXPANDED TO ALLOW ELIGIBLE UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS TO COMPETE FOR CAL GRANT AWARDS JUST AS THEIR PEERS DO. WITHOUT ADDITIONAL BARRIERS DESPITE THE ELIGIBILITY OF THE CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT FILERS FOR ENTITLEMENT CAL GRANTS CURRENT STATUTE REQUIRES THE ALL ELIGIBLE STUDENTS COMPLETING A FAFSA. MUST BE AWARDED THE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT BEFORE THEIR PEERS THAT COMPLETE THE CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT. TO SO IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND CHANCE APPLIED. FOR ROUGHLY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND COMPETITIVE CAL GRANTS MEANING THAT FEWER THAN 7% OF THESE APPLICANTS RECEIVED MUCH NEEDED FINANCIAL AID. THIS IS ACTUALLY MEANS THAT CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT FILERS WILL NEVER RECEIVED THE COMPETITIVE AWARDS DESPITE POTENTIALLY HAVING GREATER FINANCIAL NEED AND DEMONSTRATING. THE SAME ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE. I THANK YOU ALL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO INCLUDE YOU SEE STRANDS AND YOUR PRIORITIES THIS YEAR. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TO SEE AN AFFORDABLE YOU SEE EDUCATION BECOME A REALITY FOR ALL OF ACTION POPULATIONS. THANK YOU [inaudible] MIA. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS MIA KEY JANICE I'M A SENIOR AT SACRAMENTO STATE STUDYING BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION AND I'M HERE REPRESENTING CSU STUDENTS AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE CAL STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION. I WOULD LIKE TO THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MCCARTY MEDINA AFTER GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO REPRESENT MY CONSTITUENTS AND THAT'S CRITICAL CONVERSATION. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK OUR STATE LEADERS AND OUR INSTITUTIONAL LEADERS FOR WORKING TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE AND CALIFORNIA. DESPITE THIS WORK THE REASON THAT WE ARE HERE TODAY IS BECAUSE THERE IS STILL A GREAT PROBLEM IMPACTING OUR STUDENTS. ONE THAT OUR STATE'S FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM STILL DOES NOT ADDRESS. LET ME START BY DESCRIBING THE PROBLEM AS CSU STUDENTS YET. LAST YEAR'S CS A SAVER RELEASED A REPORT WITH TI GUESS WHICH FOUND THAT ALTHOUGH CSU HAS ONE OF THE LOWEST TUITIONS IN THE COUNTRY. AND WERE NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF STUDENTS DO NOT PAY TUITION AT ALL. MANY ASSUME THAT THE CSU DEGREES AFFORDABLE. YET FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS% CONTINUE TO FACE VERY REAL CHALLENGES AFFORDING ALL OF THE COSTS NECESSARY TO EARN A COLLEGE DEGREE. THIS IS REFLECTED IN DEBT BURDENS THAT FALL MORE HEAVILY ON UNDER REPRESENTED STUDENTS AND EXCESSIVE WORK HOURS NEEDED TO COVER LOW INCOME STUDENTS NOT COSTS. FOR EXAMPLE EIGHT IN TEN STUDENTS WHO GRADUATE WITH THAT HAVE ANNUAL FAMILY INCOMES OF FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS OR LESS. AND TWO THIRDS AND ANNUAL FAMILY INCOMES OF LESS THAN TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. WEEKLY WORK HOURS NEEDED RANGE FROM TWENTY TO FIFTY FIVE WITH A MEDIAN OF TWENTY NINE HOURS. THREE AND FOUR AFRICAN AMERICAN BACHELOR'S DEGREE RECIPIENTS GRADUATE WITH STUDENT LOAN DEBT. NEXT MOST OF YOU IN AS HEARING ARE AWARE OF THE BASIC NEEDS CHALLENGES FACING OUR STUDENTS. TEN POINT 9% OF CSU STUDENTS ARE HOMELESS. OVER 40% FACE SOME. TO SOME FORM OF FOOD INSECURITY. UNFORTUNATELY NO HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA AVOID THESE ISSUES. LOW INCOME STUDENTS ACROSS ALL SEGMENTS STRUGGLE TO FEED THEMSELVES REGULARLY AND FALL INTO HOMELESSNESS. THIS IS A SIGN THAT OUR FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM IS NOT GIVING ENOUGH TO THE STUDENTS WHO NEED THE MOST SUPPORT. OF COURSE MUCH HAS BEEN DONE TO SUPPORT BASIC NEEDS CHALLENGES THAT STUDENTS FACE. CAMPUSES LEADERSHIP STUDENT LEADERSHIP AND STATE LEADERSHIP OF ALL STEPPED UP TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. BUT WE ALSO BE WORKING TOWARD THE TIME WHEN NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY. WHEN THE STUDENTS STRUGGLE IS NOT HOW I FEED MYSELF TODAY BUT RATHER HOW I GET AN A ON MY MID TERM? THERE IS THE RESIDENCE HALL ADVISER ON MY CAMPUS AT SACRAMENTO STATE. SHE SOUGHT OUT THE ROLE AS AN RA BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO SUPPORT HER PEERS AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAD A WHOLE SOME COLLEGE EXPERIENCE ONE THAT SHE LONGED FOR AS WELL. AND AS AN R. A. HER HOUSING IS COVERED BY THE UNIVERSITY. YET SHE STILL HAS TO WORK THREE JOBS IS THIS DUTIES. THAT MEANS YES FOR TOTAL JOBS PLUS SCHOOL AND SHE'S BEING A ROLE MODEL TO HER PEERS. SHE'S A COMPLETELY FINANCIALLY INDEPENDENT WOMAN OF COLOR AND IS MAKING TREMENDOUS SACRIFICES. THIS STORY OF HERS MAKES ME ASK HOW CAN STUDENTS BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE CLASSROOM IF THEY CANNOT AFFORD THEIR COLLEGE EXPERIENCE. OF COURSE RESOURCES TO THE INSTITUTION ARE NECESSARY FOR STUDENTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AND FOR YEARS CSSA. HAS STOOD ALONGSIDE OR INSTITUTION AND MAKING THAT CASE TO YOU ALL. BUT WITHOUT INVESTMENT INTO FINANCIAL AID TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES FOR ARE UNDER REPRESENTED AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS. THE INVESTMENT INTO THE INSTITUTION CAN NEVER BE FULLY REALIZED. HERE'S WHAT STUDENTS ALL ACROSS ALL SEGMENTS OUR LOOKING TO SEE ACHIEVED WE KNOW IT'S A BOLD GOAL. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT OUR STATE LEADERS AND DON'T SHY AWAY FROM BOLD OPPORTUNITIES. SO FIRST IF A STUDENT HAS AN ECONOMIC NEED AND GETS ACCEPTED INTO COLLEGE IN CALIFORNIA WE NEED TO REDUCE AND REMOVE BARRIERS SO THAT THEY CAN RECEIVE STATE AID. SECOND AS THE TEARS HAVE MENTIONED WE NEED TO DO MORE TO COVER THE NON TUITION COSTS FACING OUR STUDENTS FOOD HOUSING BOOKS TRANSPORTATION. THIRD STUDENTS WHO WANT TO GRADUATE QUICKER BY ATTENDING SUMMER COURSES SHOULD ACCESS TO STATE AID TO MAKE THAT A REALISTIC POSSIBILITY FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS. FOURTH WHILE WE WORK TO FIX FINANCIAL AID BASIC ME THE NATIONAL NEED TO BE FUNDED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I WOULD LIKE TO AND MY COMMENTS WITH IT A SHORT ANECDOTE. WHEN STUDENT LEADERS SOME STANDING SITTING WITH ME TODAY FROM CALIFORNIA JOINS OTHER STUDENT LEADERS FROM NEW YORK AND FLORIDA? TO ADVOCATE IN WASHINGTON DC WE TALKED WITH THAT WE TALKED ABOUT FINANCIAL AID IN AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES IN OUR STATE AND ACROSS OUR NATION. AND AND ONE OF THEM OUR MEETINGS A CONGRESSMAN ASKED WHY IS THIS HAPPENING WISE IT'S AFFORDABILITY CRISIS HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA. AND AT THE TIME IT WAS HARD TO GIVE HIM AN ANSWER WHY. BUT I THINK I CAN ANSWER THAT TODAY. IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE DONE THE NECESSARY JOB OF GETTING MORE STUDENTS PARTICULARLY LOW INCOME STUDENTS TO ENROLL IN COLLEGE. ADDITIONALLY TODAY AND HAS NEVER BEEN MORE EXPENSIVE TO LIVE IN OUR STATE. AND LASTLY THE PALO WORD HAS NEVER HAD A LOWER PURCHASING POWER. THIS MEANS THAT WHILE THE STATE STILL DOES A GREAT JOB ON TUITION STUDENTS ARE DROWNING IN NON TUITION COSTS WITH VERY FEW LIFERAFTS. STUDENTS HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL ON PAL BUT WE KNOW WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TAKES A STEP BACK. ARE CALIFORNIA LEADERS TAKE A STEP FORWARD. WE ARE ASKING YOU TO TAKE THE STEPS TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH DANNY [inaudible] Q.. MORNING JOHN MEDINA AND MCCARTY UP MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE. MY NAME IS DANNY FEARFUL AND I SERVE AS LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS DIRECTOR FOR REGION TO FOR THIS IN SENATE FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AND TODAY AT THE HONOR TALKING ABOUT MY JOURNEY TARGET EDUCATION AND THROUGH IT. AS WELL AS THE IMPACT FINANCIALLY IT HAS HAD ON ME. WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL? I ALWAYS THOUGHT I WOULD END UP LIKE WHAT I SAW ON TV I WOULD BE THIS TEEN THAT WOULD HAVE GOOD GRADES. GO OFF TO COLLEGE AND MOVED OUT OF MY PARENTS HOUSE BY. EIGHTEEN AND FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS I WAS IT WAS GOING TO BE AMAZING. I WOULD BE LIVING IN A DORM TAKE PART IN STERN ORGANIZATIONS. AND ONLY HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING MY EDUCATION DONE. SO I CAN FIND A FULL TIME JOB LATER IN A CAREER THAT I WANTED. AND BEING IN LOW INCOME STUDENTS I THOUGHT KNOW DAT. MY TUITION IS GOING TO BE PAID. FOR I'D BE GETTING A LOT OF SCHOLARSHIPS BECAUSE OF THE EXTRA CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES AND HAVING HIGH GPA. I MY FINANCIAL AID WOULD COVER MY TEXTBOOKS FOOD AND HOUSING. AND MY FAMILY WOULD BE STRESS FREE. I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER THAN. TO BELIEVE WHAT I SAW ON TV. I I WAS ALWAYS. TAUGHT THOUGH IN HIGH SCHOOL AND I WAS BEING PREPARED FOR THAT EXPECTATION THOUGH. AND THE REALITY IT IS NOT. WHAT IT IS? I COULD NOT MOVE OUT. I STILL OF THE PARENTS AND I'M. TWENTY ONE IS MY THIRD YEAR AT A COMMUNICATIVE. AND WORK PART TIME. HEY PAY BILLS WHEN I CAN. TAKING CLASSES. SOME DAYS I DO GO HUNGRY. OTHER DAYS I USE MY CREDIT CARD TO EAT BUT NOT AFTER CHECKING MY BANK ACCOUNT EVERY SINGLE TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT I DON'T GET THE CLIENT AT THE CASH REGISTER. AND THEN. I DON'T HAVE A CAR SO I HAVE TO USE PUBLIC TRANSIT. SOMETIMES IT'S NOT RELIABLE OR SOMETIMES THE WEATHER MAY NOT ALLOW ME TO TRAVEL SO LONG. OUTDOORS AND HAVE TO RELY ON RIGHT SERVICE HERE RIGHT SERVICE APPS. TO GET FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER OTHERWISE I'D BE DRENCHED AND MY SCHOOL WORK WOULD BE DAMAGED. MY FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE GIVES ME ENOUGH TO COVER TUITION TEXTBOOKS AND SUPPLIES AND SOME MEALS. BUT I WOULD STRUGGLE TO BALANCE MY JOB WITH MY ACADEMICS. MY NEEDS WITH MY RESPONSIBILITIES AT HOME. AND MY HUNGER WITH MY DEBT OVER THE NEXT THREE MONTHS FOR THE SEMESTER UNTIL THE NEXT MISTER COMES. BEING FIRST GENERATION AMERICAN AND FIRST GENERATION OF MY FAMILY TO GO TO COLLEGE. IT IS MY DUTY TO BE TRIUMPHANT. TO FACE ADVERSITY HEAD ON AND NOT ALLOW ANYTHING TO STOP ME AND I WILL I WILL GET MY DEGREE. AND I WILL ENCOURAGE AT LEAST AMOUNT POSSIBLE. AND O. MOVE OUT WITH MY AT MY PARENTS HOUSE EVENTUALLY. BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE THIS DIFFICULT. SINCE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO STRUGGLE TO EAT. STRUGGLE TO FIND HOUSING. STRUGGLE TO BALANCE A JOB WITH ACADEMICS. AND SIMPLE FIX ITS FINANCIAL AID FORM. WE NEED TO INCREASE A SET ACCESSIBILITY. AND THE INCREASING THE AMOUNT. THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT WITH INCREASED EIGHT STUDENTS WILL BE ABLE TO FOCUS BETTER ON THE EDUCATION. I KNOW I WOULD. ANCHORED YOU TO THE RIGHT BY THE NEXT GENERATION AND THAT WILL LEAD OUR STATE AND OUR NATION. TO FIX FINANCIAL AID IS A BETTER FUTURE CAN BE MADE [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] NATHAN. MORNING THREE CHAIRS MEMBERS OF STAFF MY NAME IS MAKING ANY IS AND I'M A STUDENT FROM PACIFIC UNIVERSITY THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO MY TESTIMONY TODAY.

AND SEE FINANCING IMPOSSIBLE FOR BOTH HISPANIC NEED AMERICAN PERSPECTIVE. A LACK OF RESOURCES WILL SUPPORT FOR TO PUT THE IDEA OF COLLEGE HOW MUCH FURTHER OUT OF REACH.

DRUG GRADE SCHOOL I WAS MOTIVATED TO ATTEND COLLEGE AND MOTIVATION FUEL BY STORIES MY PARENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO EARN A COLLEGE DEGREE. HOWEVER THE PROCESS LIKE FOR MANY WAS NOT EASY WITH MY PARENTS DIVORCE AND NUMEROUS FINANCE ROADBLOCKS ON THE WAY. ADVANCE MY SENIOR YEAR IT WAS APPARENT SCHOLARSHIPS GRANTS. FOR STUDENT LOANS WERE NEEDED TO PAY FOR COLLEGE AS A FINANCIAL BURDEN ON MY PARENTS TO BE TOO HEAVY. FORTUNATELY I QUALIFIED FOR THE CAL GRANT WHICH CONSIDERABLY LOWER THE COST OF COLLEGE ATTENDANCE AND ALLOW FOR CONSIDERATION A PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES OFFER SMALL CLASS SIZES. PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS AND FOR ME A CHRISTIAN EDUCATION. I CHOSE THIS PACIFIC UNIVERSITY RECORD SANTA HOMETOWN OF THIS IS A PURSUE MY PASSIONS LOOKING BACK TO MY COMMUNITY.

I AM NOT FAMILIAR ENOUGH WITH THE FORM ITSELF I DO KNOW THAT FOREIGN DOCUMENTS DANCER AUTOMATICALLY. PUT INTO THE COMPETITIVE C. POOL. AND IT'S OKAY CAM THAT THE PERSON FROM -- THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION ANSWER. IS ONE FEDERAL IN ONE STATE. THAT'S CORRECT SO -- STUDENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE IN STATE TUITION -- AB. FIVE FORTY CAN FILL OUT THE CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT APPLICATION WHICH IS THE STATE BASED APPLICATION THAT REPLICATES THE FEDERAL APPLICATION THE FACT THAT AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE.

OF WE HEARD FROM YOU -- OBSTACLES THAT WE CAN TAKE OUT OF THE WAY WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU LIKE. TO LEAVE WITH US. YOU KNOW I I THINK WHAT ALL THE STUDENTS HAVE MENTIONED WOULD BE HELPFUL SOLUTIONS I I THINK THAT -- IN PREVIOUS PANELS THAT WE SAW TODAY ON LOOKING AT OKAY WELL IF YOU HAD ONE GO OUT IT WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH ONE PART OF MONEY. TO ME I THINK. I THINK THAT'S WHAT LED US TO THIS PROBLEM AS THAT WE'VE YOU KNOW SEEN SOLUTIONS COME IN BITS AND PIECES. AND I THINK REALLY WHAT OUR STUDENTS NEED TODAY IS A PACKAGE THE NEED TO SEE A PLAN. THEY NEED TO SEE YOU KNOW IF IT'S TODAY IF IT'S LONG TERM WHATEVER IT IS I THINK SEEING A PLAN OF HOW THESE SOLUTIONS CAN BE CREATED OVER TIME. THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY THE PIGEON HOME -- ANY BUDGETS OR ARE PUT OTHERS -- AND UNCOMFORTABLE POSITIONS BY MAKING GIVING US TIME TO CREATE A PLAN AND I THINK THAT'S EXTREMELY NECESSARY NOT SAYING OKAY WILL WANT WHAT IS THE ONLY OR ONE THING THAT COULD BE FEASIBLE. I THINK ALL OF THESE SOLUTIONS THAT WE'RE PROVIDING. CAN BE FEASIBLE AND WE CAN BE CREATIVE AROUND THAT AND I THINK ALL OF US STUDENTS ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN BEING A PART OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS. AND HELPING CREATE A PLAN THAT CAN HELP LONG TERM FOR OUR STUDENTS THINK BUT I WILL. RESPECT GO BACK SO WE DO ADOPT A PLAN IT'S A MULTI YEAR. PLAN AND WE CAN PHASE IN CERTAIN ELEMENTS WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT IS IT TO HELP YOU IN YOUR COLLEAGUES. GRADUATE WITH LESS DEBT -- HELP YOUR LITTLE NEPHEWS AND BROTHERS AND COUSINS GET IN. AND GET A GREAT THE FIRST PLACE TO GO OUT TO GET THAT SO WE HAVE.% TO BALANCE THOSE COMPETING NEEDS AND AS A STUDENT LEADER YOU'RE YOU'RE ONE OF FOUR POUND THE PANEL BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD START. I THINK THAT SAID THAT'S A TOUGH QUESTION TO ANSWER AND THAT'S WHY I WAS YOU KNOW KIND OF THINKING ONE OTHER PANELISTS WOULD ANSWER THAT QUESTION. THAT I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A HOLISTIC CONVERSATION MORE SO ABOUT -- WHERE THE NEEDS ARE WHICH WE'VE DESCRIBED IN ALSO WHEN THOSE SOLUTIONS CAN BE MADE -- I KNOW THAT SOME MIGHT BE EASIER TO MAKE SOME MIGHT BE QUICKER FIXES THAN OTHERS IF IT'S YOU KNOW FUNDING BASIC NEEDS REQUEST THAT AND INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL FOR NOW AND WORKING ON A MORE LONG TERM STRATEGY MOVING FORWARD I KNOW THE CSU. ONLY HAS A ONE TIME -- FUNDING REQUEST FOR BASIC NEEDS LOOKING OUT WHAT THAT COULD LOOK LIKE LONG TERM WILL HELP IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND YOU KNOW WHEN THERE'S DIFFERENT ISSUES OF ACCESS AND THEN ALSO THE BASIC NEEDS. COMPONENT -- AND GRADUATING WITH THAT THOSE ARE THREE ISSUES THAT ARE KIND OF MOVING IN DIFFERENT AREAS AND HAVE DIFFERENT -- IMPACTS OF WHAT'S CAUSING THEM. SO -- I WOULD SAY. WE SHOULD LOOK AT PRIORITIES AND I THINK ALL FOR OF BEES -- ITEMS THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE BRINGING FORWARD SHOULD BE PRIORITIES -- AND SEEMED KIND OF HOW WHAT YOU'RE LEADERSHIP SAYS ON WHAT WE CAN DO FIRST [inaudible] THANK YOU. WHAT TYPE BEFORE WE GET THE PUBLIC COMMENTS WHEN I SAY THANK YOU FOR THE STUDENT PANEL YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS HAVE THE STUDENT PANEL -- AT THE END FOR SOME REASON AND HE SAID. FLIP IT SO WE CAN HAVE MORE OF OUR MEMBERSHEARING FROM THAT THE STUDENTS AND YOU KNOW. YOU HAVE THAT. THE REALISTIC -- UNDERSTANDING OF AND HOW A MINIMUM WAGE JOB DOESN'T GO AS FAR TO COVER THE BASICS LIKE IT DID THIRTY YEARS AGO AND HOUSING COSTS ARE JUST NIGHT AND DAY. SO WE WANT TO MODERNIZE OUR COLLEGE FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM AND GET TOWARDS A GOAL OVER CAN HAVE DEBT FREE COLLEGE HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT CERTAINLY. THE GOAL BUT REALIZING THAT YOU KNOW WE NEED TO MAKE COLLEGE. MORE AFFORDABLE FOR THE CURRENT STUDENTS THAT WE ALL SEE MORE PEOPLE GOING TO CALLS FOR OUR ECONOMY SO I THINK THIS HELPS. PUT IT ALL TOGETHER SO THANK YOU. GO AHEAD OKAY SO SO WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO -- TO PUBLIC PUBLIC COMMENT NOW AND YOU CAN ASK OUR PUBLIC COMMENT PARTICIPANTS TO KEEP THEIR COMMENTS TO ONE MINUTE -- LAST. ONE METER LAST WE HAVE A BIG LINE AND WE HAVE TO HAVE TO GO AND IN SOME OF US HAVE A GOOD ARE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS IN A LITTLE BIT -- BUT I BELIEVE MISTER -- IMPLEMENTING GOV -- MINUTE OR LESS AND IF YOU CAN. TACK ON TO SOMEBODY ALSO BE GREAT WE WE DO HAVE TO GO TO A CAUCUS DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS IN A FEW MOMENTS PRESENT ON THE BUDGET. INCLUDING THIS SAME TALK IT TOPIC ABOUT.

AXIS BE IF THE CALPERS HOOKED HEALTH FIRST ACCESS BE IS THE DEATH DONE ASSISTANCE PAYMENT RATHER THAN AN ASSISTANT PAYMENT. IT'S KIND OF TECHNICAL BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS IF YOU MAKE A LITTLE CHANGE IN THE CAR. CAL GRANT SYSTEM A HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS WOULD BE ABLE TO GET FOOD STAMPS.

ON THE CAPACITY FOR YOU SEE OUR STUDENTS TO RECEIVE ENOUGH FINANCIAL AID TO COVER THEIR TUITION COSTS HAD HAVE BEEN OFFSET BY LARGE DISPARITIES IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES.

DURING OUR TIME AS UNDERGRADUATES AT UCSC. THEN PLEASE INDOOR CONDITION AS FOOD INSECURE STUDENTS BECAUSE WE OFTEN HOLD TWO SOMETIMES THREE FOR PART TIME OR FULL TIME JOBS TO TRY TO MAKE SURE WE CAN MEET OUR BASIC NEEDS. BECAUSE FINANCIALLY IT JUST DOESN'T DO THAT FOR US AND YOU ALREADY HEARD MANY STUDENTS TALK ABOUT THIS RIGHT. UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT THAT FINANCIALLY THE WAY THAT IT IS SET UP RIGHT NOW IS JUST NOT GOING TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE FOR STUDENTS IN NEED. I WANT ALSO ON I WANT TO ALMOST SAY THAT THE PRIORITIES AND FINANCIALLY PERFORM AT THIS POINT -- INTUITIVE THEIR COMMONSENSE. SO BODY CRITERIA FOR THOSE WHO DON'T CURRENTLY QUALIFY FOR STATE BASED AID AND HELP STUDENTS GRADUATION RATES BY EXPANDING CAL GRANT INTO THE SUMMER THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

HELLO EVERYONE MY NAME IS JAMIE CAN RECOMMEND THE UNDERGRADUATE EXCEL VICE PRESIDENT AT UCLA I ALSO SERVE AS THE VICE CHAIR. FOR THE UC STUDENT. UNIVERSITY AFFAIRS COMMITTEE -- THE ONLY REASON I AM HERE TODAY IS BECAUSE OF THE FINANCIAL AID THAT I RECEIVE -- IT IN FACT AS A FOURTH YEAR I AM ACTUALLY HAVING TROUBLE GETTING THE CLASSES THAT I NEED TO GRADUATE SO IT LOOKS LIKE I'M GOING TO STAND BY IT BUT A LOT OF MY FRIENDS HAVE NOT HAD THE SAME FATE AND MANY OF THEM ARE HAVING TO STAY LONGER. THANKFULLY I WAS ABLE TO ACCESS SOME RECESSION AND IT LOOKS LIKE THAT I'M GRADUATING IN THE SPRING -- ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE NEED TO EXPAND CAL GRANTS THE SUMMER IS BECAUSE THIS ISSUE INTERSECTS WITH SO MANY OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS THAT WE SEE -- I HAVEN'T ESPECIALLY AS IN ROMAN INCREASES AT THE UC AND OF STUDENTS ARE HAVING TO STAY LONGER AYE SENIORS AS MORE COMING IN AS FRESHMEN WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO SEE WORSENING HOUSING AND SECURITY -- LARGER CLASSES THE SMALLEST ONE THAT I'VE BEEN IN UP UNTIL THIS QUARTER WAS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY PEOPLE -- SO I DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO MY PROFESSOR IS -- AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE IT CONTINUED LÃ  SEE WHAT IT MIGHT OR TO TO PASS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. UGH AFTER LETTERS LETTERS MY NAME IS COMING OFF AND WENT TO COURT ON THE CHAIR OF THE COLOR FOR BETTY SEE. NOW I'VE SORT OF POINT OUT WHAT I HOPE IS A TYPO IN THIS AGENDA DOCUMENT ON PAGE NINE SECOND PARAGRAPH -- BOLD SAYS DESPITE STATE AND SEGMENT FOCUS ON QUICK ATTACH A DEGREE STATE AID DOES ADEQUATELY COVER SOME SCHOOL COSTS. OTHER IS NOT A PROBLEM WITH THIS IS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IN THE UC SINCE ONLY RECEIVED PELL GRANTS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONAL GRANTS FROM FROM THE INSTITUTION AND THE ONLY THEY CAN ACCESS THE STATE AID IS THAT THEY DON'T USE IT DURING THE REGULAR ACADEMIC -- SO THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AND IN ADDITION TO THAT WE KNOW THAT WHEN STUDENTS DO GET THOSE TO GRANT IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH TO COVER TUITION AND CAMPUS BASED FEES. SO AT THIS PROGRAM HE WAS RIGHT TALK ABOUT THE COST OF HOUSING THE COST OF FOOD WITH A COST OF TEXTBOOKS SO THAT'S WHY I'M HERE JUST IN MY SUPPORT FOR ITS BEFORE.
