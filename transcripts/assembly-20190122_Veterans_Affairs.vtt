AND HOW WHAT I SEE TODAY

00:26:10.769 --> 00:26:12.504
CONTRAST WITH WHAT I FOUND WHEN

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:16.408

00:26:16.474 --> 00:26:16.975
TWENTY FIFTEEN MY INTENTION

BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT I HAVE

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:26.985
TO START BY EXPLAINING WHERE WE

00:26:27.052 --> 00:26:28.520
WERE JUST SEVERAL YEARS AGO.

00:26:28.586 --> 00:26:31.122
HOW WE ARRIVE WHERE WE ARE TODAY

00:26:31.189 --> 00:26:31.423
[inaudible]

00:26:31.489 --> 00:26:33.458
PARDON ME.

00:26:33.525 --> 00:26:35.293
WHEN I BEGAN MY TENURE CALVET

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.796
WAS IN NEED OF TRANSFORMATION?

00:26:37.862 --> 00:26:39.664
THE AGENCY HAD BEEN WEAKENED BY

00:26:39.731 --> 00:26:41.266
LEADERSHIP TURN OVER AND WAS

00:26:41.333 --> 00:26:43.068
SEARCHING FOR A CLEAR IDENTITY

00:26:43.134 --> 00:26:44.135
AND CULTURE.

00:26:44.202 --> 00:26:45.704
AT THE SAME TIME MANY OF OUR

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:48.373
PROGRAMS WERE EXPERIENCING GREAT%

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.575
EXPANSION IN THEIR SCOPE WE WERE

00:26:50.642 --> 00:26:52.744
ABOUT TO OPEN A NEW CEMETERY IN

00:26:52.811 --> 00:26:53.812
MONTEREY.

00:26:53.878 --> 00:26:56.247
OPEN THE LAST OF FIVE NEW

00:26:56.314 --> 00:26:58.516
VETERANS HOMES AND WE WERE ABOUT

00:26:58.583 --> 00:26:59.951
TO START THE VETERANS HOUSING

00:27:00.018 --> 00:27:01.286
AND HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION

00:27:01.353 --> 00:27:03.989
PROGRAM WHICH I WILL REFER TO

00:27:04.055 --> 00:27:07.125
GOING FORWARD AS V. H. H. P..

00:27:07.192 --> 00:27:09.060
AT THAT SAME TIME WE ARE ALSO

00:27:09.127 --> 00:27:10.795
FACED WITH MANY CHALLENGES.

00:27:10.862 --> 00:27:12.530
ESPECIALLY IN THE EIGHT VETERANS

00:27:12.597 --> 00:27:14.065
HOMES.

00:27:14.132 --> 00:27:16.468
MEETING THOSE CHALLENGES.

00:27:16.534 --> 00:27:17.736
ESPECIALLY WITH YOUR HELP AND

00:27:17.802 --> 00:27:19.738
INSTRUCTION REQUIRED THOUGHTFUL

00:27:19.804 --> 00:27:23.108
AND STRICT PRIORITIZATION. FOR

00:27:23.174 --> 00:27:24.109
US SAID CAL THAT THE MOST

00:27:24.175 --> 00:27:26.378
IMPORTANT PRIORITY AT THE TIME

00:27:26.444 --> 00:27:29.014
WAS TO OPEN AND STAFF.

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.616
THE NEW VETERANS HOMES IN FRESNO

00:27:31.683 --> 00:27:34.586
READING AND WEST LOS ANGELES.

00:27:34.652 --> 00:27:36.054
AND AS WE DID THAT I SAW THAT

00:27:36.121 --> 00:27:38.356
WHILE MOST OF THE HOMES PROVIDED

00:27:38.423 --> 00:27:39.891
SAFE QUALITY CARE.

00:27:39.958 --> 00:27:41.426
THEY WERE NOT THE EXCELLENT

00:27:41.493 --> 00:27:43.328
MODELS OF CLINICAL CARE THAT I

00:27:43.395 --> 00:27:47.132
EXPECTED AND THAT THEY ARE TODAY.

00:27:47.198 --> 00:27:49.067
IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE

00:27:49.134 --> 00:27:50.902
EIGHT HOMES SCATTERED ALL OVER

00:27:50.969 --> 00:27:52.971
THE STATE WERE STANDALONE

00:27:53.038 --> 00:27:54.472
ENTITIES.

00:27:54.539 --> 00:27:56.041
THEY LACK THE COHESION AND

00:27:56.107 --> 00:27:58.043
DEFICIENCIES OF A MODERN HEALTH

00:27:58.109 --> 00:27:59.411
CARE NETWORK.

00:27:59.477 --> 00:28:00.278
MANY OF THE HOMES WERE

00:28:00.345 --> 00:28:02.680
STRUGGLING WITH LOWER STAR

00:28:02.747 --> 00:28:04.916
RATINGS FROM THE US CENTERS FOR

00:28:04.983 --> 00:28:07.285
MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES.

00:28:07.352 --> 00:28:08.653
AND THEY WERE OPERATING WITH

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.455
DISPARATE PROCESS SEES OUTDATED

00:28:10.522 --> 00:28:13.825
TECHNOLOGY. FOR THESE REASONS MY

00:28:13.892 --> 00:28:15.860
EXECUTIVE TEAM AND I ESTABLISH

00:28:15.927 --> 00:28:17.862
PRIORITIES FOR THE HOMES.

00:28:17.929 --> 00:28:19.998
IN THE AREAS OF QUALITY OF CARE

00:28:20.065 --> 00:28:21.199
AND STANDARDIZATION OF

00:28:21.266 --> 00:28:24.035
OPERATIONS AMONG MANY OTHERS.

00:28:24.102 --> 00:28:25.970
AND AS A RESULT OUR PERFORMANCE

00:28:26.037 --> 00:28:27.772
IN MANY AREAS HAS GONE FROM

00:28:27.839 --> 00:28:30.675
MERELY ADEQUATE TO OUTSTANDING

00:28:30.742 --> 00:28:32.911
AND THE PROOF IS IN OUR OUTCOMES

00:28:32.977 --> 00:28:34.512
SO LET ME NAME A FEW.

00:28:34.579 --> 00:28:35.613
TODAY.

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.849

YEARS AGO WHEN ALL HOMES WERE AT

00:28:51.629 --> 00:28:53.064
ONLY TWO STARS.

00:28:53.131 --> 00:28:55.867

00:30:46.077 --> 00:30:47.111
OUR VETERANS HOMES.

00:30:47.178 --> 00:30:49.914
LATER THIS YEAR.

00:30:49.981 --> 00:30:51.416
BUT MORE REMAINS TO BE DONE.

00:30:51.482 --> 00:30:53.151
IN OUR STANDARDIZATION OF CARE

00:30:53.218 --> 00:30:55.253
IN THE HOMES ONE AREA OF

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:56.688
IMPROVEMENT I AM CURRENTLY

00:30:56.754 --> 00:30:57.789
ADDRESSING.

00:30:57.855 --> 00:30:59.924
IS HOW WE ENGAGE IN LEASES

00:30:59.991 --> 00:31:02.594
LICENSES AND OTHER PARTNERSHIPS

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:04.562
IN OUR VETERANS HOME PROPERTIES

00:31:04.629 --> 00:31:06.698
INCLUDING THE MUCH DISCUSSED YON

00:31:06.764 --> 00:31:08.166
PHIL HOME.

00:31:08.233 --> 00:31:09.400
I HAVE RECENTLY TAKEN A CRITICAL

00:31:09.467 --> 00:31:11.236
STEP TO ENSURE THAT OUR LEASE

00:31:11.302 --> 00:31:13.671
ARRANGEMENTS ARE MADE IN THE

00:31:13.738 --> 00:31:15.440
BEST INTERESTS OF THE STATE.

00:31:15.506 --> 00:31:16.207
OF OUR VETERAN HOME SYSTEM AND

00:31:16.274 --> 00:31:19.677
MORE THE VETERANS WHO LIVE IN

00:31:19.744 --> 00:31:21.045
THOSE HOMES.

00:31:21.112 --> 00:31:22.447
I HAVE ISSUED A DIRECTIVE TO

00:31:22.513 --> 00:31:24.449
COMPLETELY OVERHAUL OUR LEASE

00:31:24.515 --> 00:31:26.317
MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND OUR

00:31:26.384 --> 00:31:32.156
PROPERTY REQUIREMENTS THAT ALL

00:31:32.223 --> 00:31:33.091
AGREEMENTS.

00:31:33.157 --> 00:31:35.159
MUST SUPPORT BOTH THE INTERESTS

00:31:35.226 --> 00:31:36.894
OF THE STATE AND OF OUR RESIDENT

00:31:36.961 --> 00:31:38.830
VETERANS.

00:31:38.896 --> 00:31:40.465
A COPY OF THIS POLICIES BEEN

00:31:40.531 --> 00:31:41.866
PROVIDED TO THE COMMITTEE

00:31:41.933 --> 00:31:42.166
[inaudible]

00:31:42.233 --> 00:31:45.203
AND AS WE IMPLEMENT --

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:46.971
THIS IMPROVED POLICY YOU WILL

00:31:47.038 --> 00:31:48.773
CAN WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.508
IN DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU.

00:31:50.575 --> 00:31:52.744
REGARDING HOW BEST TO UTILIZE

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:54.579
THE ON FILL CAMPUS TO ITS

00:31:54.646 --> 00:31:56.881
MAXIMUM POTENTIAL.

00:31:56.948 --> 00:31:57.949
BECAUSE OF THE WORK WITH

00:31:58.016 --> 00:31:59.284
CURRENTLY DOING AND THE

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:01.152
MILESTONES WE'VE ACHIEVED THE

00:32:01.219 --> 00:32:03.021
CURRENT STATE OF VETERANS HOMES

00:32:03.087 --> 00:32:04.856
I CAN REPORT.

00:32:04.922 --> 00:32:07.058
IS NOW DISTINGUISHED BY

00:32:07.125 --> 00:32:07.358
[inaudible]

00:32:07.425 --> 00:32:08.993
COMPASSIONATE CARE.

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:11.329
HI PERFORMANCE STANDARDS AND

00:32:11.396 --> 00:32:13.398
TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION.

00:32:13.464 --> 00:32:16.200
SO NOW YOU MAY BE WONDERING WHAT

00:32:16.267 --> 00:32:17.969
WILL OUR HOMES LOOK LIKE IN THE

00:32:18.036 --> 00:32:19.570
FUTURE.

00:32:19.637 --> 00:32:20.772
YOU CAN REST ASSURED THAT THIS

00:32:20.838 --> 00:32:22.307
QUESTION IS AT THE FOREFRONT OF

00:32:22.373 --> 00:32:25.043
MY THINKING AND SOMETHING I AM

00:32:25.109 --> 00:32:27.879
COMMITTED TO DEFINING.

00:32:27.945 --> 00:32:29.647
CALIFORNIA'S VETERAN POPULATION

00:32:29.714 --> 00:32:31.716
IS CHANGING.

00:32:31.783 --> 00:32:33.918
AS OUR VETERANS CONTINUE TO AGE

00:32:33.985 --> 00:32:35.620
INTO LONG TERM CARE.

00:32:35.687 --> 00:32:37.322
WE MUST BE COGNIZANT THAT THEIR

00:32:37.388 --> 00:32:39.324
MEDICAL NEEDS ARE GOING TO BE

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:41.225
DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF OUR

00:32:41.292 --> 00:32:42.727
CURRENT RESIDENTS.

00:32:42.794 --> 00:32:44.329
WHO SERVED IN WORLD WAR TWO THE

00:32:44.395 --> 00:32:47.532
KOREAN WAR AND EVEN THE VETERAN

00:32:47.598 --> 00:32:49.033
THE VIETNAM WAR?

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:50.868
OUR TEAM HAS UNDERTAKEN AN

00:32:50.935 --> 00:32:52.570
INDEPTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT THAT

00:32:52.637 --> 00:32:53.938
WILL DRIVE PLANNING FOR OUR

00:32:54.005 --> 00:32:56.974
HOMES FOR DECADES TO COME.

00:32:57.041 --> 00:32:58.509
THIS ASSESSMENT.

00:32:58.576 --> 00:33:01.079
THE FINDINGS WE DERIVE FROM IT.

00:33:01.145 --> 00:33:02.613
AND THE FIRST PHASE OF FUTURE

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:04.682
PLANNING WILL BE COMPLETE BY THE

00:33:04.749 --> 00:33:06.551
END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR AT

00:33:06.617 --> 00:33:09.520
WHICH TIME BY YOUR REQUEST.

00:33:09.587 --> 00:33:11.189
WE WILL PROVIDE OUR FINAL REPORT

00:33:11.255 --> 00:33:12.790
TO YOU.

00:33:12.857 --> 00:33:13.991
I LOOK FORWARD TO USING THIS

00:33:14.058 --> 00:33:15.927
VALUABLE TOOL TO TAKE OUR HOMES

00:33:15.993 --> 00:33:17.729
INTO THE NEXT CHAPTER.

00:33:17.795 --> 00:33:19.163
OF HOW CALIFORNIA MEETS VETERANS

00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:21.032
NEEDS.

00:33:21.099 --> 00:33:22.667
THIS NEEDS ASSESSMENT WILL ALSO

00:33:22.734 --> 00:33:24.535
INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF A

00:33:24.602 --> 00:33:26.304
MASTER PLAN FOR EACH OF OUR

00:33:26.371 --> 00:33:28.072
HOMES THE VETERANS HOMES OF

00:33:28.139 --> 00:33:30.141
CALIFORNIA FULFILL THE IMPORTANT

00:33:30.208 --> 00:33:31.776
PROMISE MADE BY THE STATE TO

00:33:31.843 --> 00:33:33.911
CARE FOR OUR AGED AND DISABLED

00:33:33.978 --> 00:33:35.012
VETERANS.

00:33:35.079 --> 00:33:37.014
AND IT IS MY SOLEMN COMMITMENT

00:33:37.081 --> 00:33:38.483
TO ENSURE THAT WE NOT ONLY

00:33:38.549 --> 00:33:40.985
FULFILL THIS PROMISE BUT THAT WE

00:33:41.052 --> 00:33:42.520
DO SO WITH EXCELLENCE.

00:33:42.587 --> 00:33:44.088
HOWEVER.

00:33:44.155 --> 00:33:45.890
IF I COULD GO BACK IN TIME TO

00:33:45.957 --> 00:33:48.593
DESIGN A PLAN FOR LOCATING THE

00:33:48.659 --> 00:33:50.161
VETERANS HOMES.

00:33:50.228 --> 00:33:50.828
THE MAP WOULD LOOK QUITE

00:33:50.895 --> 00:33:53.898
DIFFERENT THAN IT.

00:33:53.965 --> 00:33:55.299
IN THE BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE

00:33:55.366 --> 00:33:57.635
WORLDS I WOULD HAVE YOU SPECIFIC

00:33:57.702 --> 00:33:59.537
CRITERIA TO EVALUATE AND

00:33:59.604 --> 00:34:01.773
PRIORITIZE WHERE TO BUILD THOSE

00:34:01.839 --> 00:34:02.707
HOMES.

00:34:02.774 --> 00:34:04.842
AND WHAT LEVELS OF CARE TO

00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:06.277
PROVIDE IN THEM.

00:34:06.344 --> 00:34:08.413
AND THE CRITERIA WOULD ALL BE

00:34:08.479 --> 00:34:10.047
BASED ON PROXIMITY.

00:34:10.114 --> 00:34:12.183
SIMILARLY TO A VA HOSPITAL

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:14.886
MEDICAL FACILITY PROXIMITY TO A

00:34:14.952 --> 00:34:17.822
HIGH POPULATION OF VETERANS.

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:19.624
AND PROXIMITY TO ALL ROBUST

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:21.392
TRANSPORTATION AND SUPPORT

00:34:21.459 --> 00:34:23.394
INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:34:23.461 --> 00:34:24.629
OTHER CRITERIA WOULD HAVE

00:34:24.695 --> 00:34:27.098
INCLUDED BUILDING IN AREAS WITH

00:34:27.165 --> 00:34:28.933
A REASONABLE COST OF LIVING FOR

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.435
EMPLOYEES.

00:34:30.501 --> 00:34:32.937
AND A LARGE EMPLOYEE REGISTRY OF

00:34:33.004 --> 00:34:36.340
AVAILABLE BACK FILL WORKERS.

00:34:36.407 --> 00:34:37.909
SO SINCE WE HAVE THE BENEFIT OF

00:34:37.975 --> 00:34:40.378
HINDSIGHT WE KNOW THAT THIS IS

00:34:40.445 --> 00:34:42.146
NOT THE BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE

00:34:42.213 --> 00:34:44.482
WORLDS BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY WE

00:34:44.549 --> 00:34:46.451
HAVE HOMES THAT DIVERGED GREATLY

00:34:46.517 --> 00:34:49.787
FROM ALL OF THOSE CRITERIA.

00:34:49.854 --> 00:34:51.222
BUT WE DO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IN

00:34:51.289 --> 00:34:52.790
PART DUE TO A LEGISLATIVE

00:34:52.857 --> 00:34:54.625
MANDATE TO CONDUCT A NEEDS

00:34:54.692 --> 00:34:55.760
ASSESSMENT.

00:34:55.827 --> 00:34:57.728
AND A MASTER PLAN THAT WILL

00:34:57.795 --> 00:34:59.697
FOSTER POLICY DISCUSSION AND

00:34:59.764 --> 00:35:01.933
DECISIONS AND MY HOPE IS THAT AS

00:35:01.999 --> 00:35:03.234
WE FORMULATE A PLAN FOR THE

00:35:03.301 --> 00:35:04.969
FUTURE YOU WILL ALL BE PARTNERS

00:35:05.036 --> 00:35:05.503
WITH ME.

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:06.971
IN HELPING US TO ACCOMPLISH

00:35:07.038 --> 00:35:09.106
THESE CHANGES SO THAT FIRST AND

00:35:09.173 --> 00:35:11.175
FOREMOST WE PUT THE NEEDS OF OUR

00:35:11.242 --> 00:35:13.377
CURRENT RESIDENCE AS WELL AS

00:35:13.444 --> 00:35:14.645
THOSE OF FUTURE.

00:35:14.712 --> 00:35:16.914
GENERATIONS OF VETERANS ABOVE

00:35:16.981 --> 00:35:18.716
ALL ELSE.

00:35:18.783 --> 00:35:20.084
SO I SPOKE AT LENGTH ABOUT OUR

00:35:20.151 --> 00:35:21.919
VETERANS HOMES IN PART BECAUSE

00:35:21.986 --> 00:35:23.554
THEY MAKE UP NEARLY 80% OF MY

00:35:23.621 --> 00:35:26.090
BUDGET AND 90% OF MY WORK FORCE.

00:35:26.157 --> 00:35:27.291
AND BECAUSE I NEEDED TO

00:35:27.358 --> 00:35:29.260
PRIORITIZE THEIR IMPROVEMENT

00:35:29.327 --> 00:35:30.695
WHEN I CAME TO CAL THAT.

00:35:30.761 --> 00:35:32.330
BUT I'D ALSO LIKE TO ENSURE TO

00:35:32.396 --> 00:35:32.964
SHARE WITH YOU THE

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:35.366
ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND FUTURE PLANS.

00:35:35.433 --> 00:35:37.268
FOR THE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT

00:35:37.335 --> 00:35:38.903
SERVE VETERANS.

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:41.105
LET'S START AS A RESULT OF THE

00:35:41.172 --> 00:35:43.608
VOTER APPROVED PROPOSITION ONE

00:35:43.674 --> 00:35:44.575
BOND MEASURE AND NO.

00:35:44.642 --> 00:35:47.712
YES MA'AM.

00:35:47.778 --> 00:35:49.180
OF TO INTERRUPT RIGHT NOW BUT I

00:35:49.247 --> 00:35:51.415
THOUGHT MAYBE BECAUSE YOU HAVE A

00:35:51.482 --> 00:35:53.451
A LIST OF PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE

00:35:53.518 --> 00:35:54.118
GOING TO GO THROUGH DO YOU MIND

00:35:54.185 --> 00:35:55.052
IF.

00:35:55.119 --> 00:35:56.554
ANYBODY HAS QUESTIONS BECAUSE

00:35:56.621 --> 00:35:57.755
YOU'RE DONE WITH THE HOMES RIGHT

00:35:57.822 --> 00:36:01.058
NOW RIGHT EFFECTIVELY OKAY RIGHT.

00:36:01.125 --> 00:36:02.159
AND I THINK THAT MAYBE INSTEAD

00:36:02.226 --> 00:36:03.895
OF WAITING ALL THE WAY TILL THE

00:36:03.961 --> 00:36:05.530
END DOES ANYBODY HAVE.

00:36:05.596 --> 00:36:11.469
QUESTIONS ON THE HOME

00:36:11.536 --> 00:36:11.769
[inaudible]

GREAT JOB.

00:36:18.576 --> 00:36:22.280
QUESTION ON YON PHIL.

EXCESS OF SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY

00:36:34.425 --> 00:36:37.061
JUST NORTH OF NAPA VALLEY

00:36:37.128 --> 00:36:37.962
CORRECT.

00:36:38.029 --> 00:36:39.664
IT IT'S IN THE HEART OF NAPA

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:41.465
COUNTY IN THAT WINE PRODUCING

00:36:41.532 --> 00:36:42.700
AREA.

00:36:42.767 --> 00:36:44.402

HOW FAR AWAY IS YON PHIL FROM

THE NEAREST VA --

00:36:50.041 --> 00:36:52.910
HOSPITAL.

00:36:52.977 --> 00:36:54.111
A LONG DRIVE.

00:36:54.178 --> 00:36:56.380
VETERANS A RESIDENTS OF OUR HOME

00:36:56.447 --> 00:36:57.949
NOT JUST IN NOW FILLED BUT YOU

00:36:58.015 --> 00:36:59.417
KNOW WE'RE READING IS SHASTA

00:36:59.483 --> 00:37:00.518
COUNTY.

00:37:00.585 --> 00:37:02.119
THE VETERANS AND THEIR ALSO WHEN

00:37:02.186 --> 00:37:04.188
THEY NEED A CUTE MEDICAL CARE

00:37:04.255 --> 00:37:06.123
PROVIDED ONLY BY THE FEDERAL Vl

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:06.757
<u>&lt;c.green&gt;.&lt;/c&gt;</u>

00:37:06.824 --> 00:37:09.427
THEY MUST BOARD TRANSPORTATION.

00:37:09.493 --> 00:37:12.363
TO GO EITHER TO PALO ALTO FOR

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:13.431
MILEY IN THE HEART OF SAN

WHAT WOULD BE THE AVERAGE TIME

00:37:19.203 --> 00:37:20.204
FOR THOSE --

00:37:20.271 --> 00:37:21.305
I THINK THE QUICKEST TURNAROUND

00:37:21.372 --> 00:37:22.974
IS PROBABLY FOUR HOURS AND

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:25.376
THAT'S JUST FOR A SIMPLE BLOOD

00:37:25.443 --> 00:37:27.178
CHECKED HER BLOOD PRESSURE.

TO WE'RE CONTRACTED --

00:37:32.049 --> 00:37:34.685
WITH LOCAL HOT ALI I THINK IS

00:37:34.752 --> 00:37:36.354
THE PRIMARY HOSPITAL IN NAPA

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:39.056

THE NATION BY A FACTOR OF THREE

AND THE OLDEST VETERANS CEMETERY

00:39:52.256 --> 00:39:53.958

SMALL HOME IN MAINE.

00:40:07.171 --> 00:40:09.039
IN ORDER NO MAIN THAT CLAIMS --

00:40:09.106 --> 00:40:10.941
PRIMACY OF PLACE.

00:40:11.008 --> 00:40:13.544
BUT IT'S IT'S BECOME OVER THE

00:40:13.611 --> 00:40:16.013
DECADES CENTURY.

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:19.416
IF YOU WILL A VERY INTIMATE PART

00:40:19.483 --> 00:40:21.185
OF THE CULTURE OF NAPA COUNTY --

AND WE'RE GONNA WIND UP TALKING

00:40:21.886 --> 00:40:25.923
ABOUT ISSUES I THINK AFTER NEXT

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:27.858
WEEK WHEN THE STATE WATER OF A

00:40:27.925 --> 00:40:29.693
COMES OUT WITH A REPORT ON CAL

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.495
THAT'S HANDLING IN THE PAST OF

00:40:31.562 --> 00:40:32.463
LEASES.

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:35.132
LEASING OUT OVER THE DECADES OF

00:40:35.199 --> 00:40:37.635
ASPECTS OF THAT PROPERTY FOR THE

00:40:37.701 --> 00:40:39.837
BENEFIT OF THE COMMUNITY SOME

00:40:39.904 --> 00:40:42.173
MAY SAY TO THE EXCLUSIVE BENEFIT

00:40:42.239 --> 00:40:44.542
OF THE COMMUNITY --

00:40:44.608 --> 00:40:46.410
AND NOT TO THE THESE LEASES DO

00:40:46.477 --> 00:40:48.145
NOT READ DOWN TO NECESSARILY TO

00:40:48.212 --> 00:40:50.047
THE BENEFIT OF THE RESIDENTS

00:40:50.114 --> 00:40:50.848
THAT LIVE THERE --

00:40:50.915 --> 00:40:52.283
HERE RIGHT.

00:40:52.349 --> 00:40:53.851
IT -- COULD

00:40:53.918 --> 00:40:55.085
WE TALK ABOUT.

00:40:55.152 --> 00:40:56.520
SKILL I I THINK THAT WHEN THIS

00:40:56.587 --> 00:40:58.689
WATER COMES OUT THAT WILL BE THE

00:40:58.756 --> 00:41:00.891
FIRST QUESTION IN PEOPLE'S MINDS

00:41:00.958 --> 00:41:04.195
IS HOW BETTER TO USE THAT CAMPUS.

00:41:04.261 --> 00:41:06.030
DO I THINK THAT.

00:41:06.096 --> 00:41:07.164
I SEE POLITICALLY AND I THINK

00:41:07.231 --> 00:41:08.732
THAT POLITICALLY WE CAN.

00:41:08.799 --> 00:41:11.335
CONSIDER ABANDONING THAT

00:41:11.402 --> 00:41:13.003
PROPERTY ALL TOGETHER.

00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:14.538
I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY TO USE A

00:41:14.605 --> 00:41:16.173
WORLD WAR TWO EXPRESSION A

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:17.308
BRIDGE TOO FAR FOR ME.

00:41:17.374 --> 00:41:21.545
BUT IN MANY WAYS IT WOULD MAKE

00:41:21.612 --> 00:41:23.280
LOGICAL AND FINANCIAL AND

00:41:23.347 --> 00:41:26.684
MEDICAL SENSE. TO PUT A NEW FOUR

00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:27.885

00:41:36.427 --> 00:41:38.629
IT MEETS ALL THE CRITERIA.

00:41:38.696 --> 00:41:40.965
PROXIMITY TO A FEDERAL VA GREAT

00:41:41.031 --> 00:41:43.601

VETERAN POPULATION PEOPLE CAN

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:47.071
AFFORD TO LIVE HERE.

MY EMPLOYEES CANNOT AFFORD TO

00:41:48.639 --> 00:41:50.341
LIVE ANYWHERE NEAR THE YOUNG

00:41:52.343 --> 00:41:53.878

THINK OF A NUMBER OF THESE.

00:44:55.826 --> 00:44:56.627
THE THE STAFF NEEDS TO BE

00:44:56.693 --> 00:44:57.494
UPDATED OKAY --

00:44:57.561 --> 00:44:58.062
THERE IS JUST THERE IS A

00:44:58.128 --> 00:45:00.464
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CAPACITY AND

00:45:00.531 --> 00:45:00.731
BETWEEN --

00:45:00.798 --> 00:45:03.167
BUDGETED BEDS --

00:45:03.233 --> 00:45:04.401
ESSENTIALLY THERE'S A NUMBER OF

00:45:04.468 --> 00:45:05.602
BEDS THROUGHOUT.

00:45:05.669 --> 00:45:06.870
ALL EIGHT EIGHT VETERANS HOMES

00:45:06.937 --> 00:45:08.672
THAT ARE NOT FILLED BECAUSE THEY

00:45:08.739 --> 00:45:10.340
DON'T HAVE WE DON'T STAFF --

00:45:10.407 --> 00:45:11.775
TO FILL IN THERE WASN'T THE NEED

00:45:11.842 --> 00:45:14.244
FOR THE FOR THE WAITING LIST FOR

00:45:14.311 --> 00:45:16.080
THOSE AREAS WE GET A NUMBER BEDS

00:45:16.146 --> 00:45:17.848
IN BARSTOW THAT HAVE NOT BEEN.

00:45:17.915 --> 00:45:18.949
BILL THERE'S THERE'S A THERE'S A

00:45:19.016 --> 00:45:20.551
BIT THERE'S SEVENTY FIVE BEDS

00:45:20.617 --> 00:45:21.685
AND AND YON PHIL.

00:45:21.752 --> 00:45:23.253
IN IN ONE OF OUR BUILDINGS THAT

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:25.189
HAS NOT BEEN FILLED BECAUSE

00:45:25.255 --> 00:45:26.490
THERE WAS NO DEMAND TO FILL IT.

00:45:26.557 --> 00:45:27.091
SO THERE'S A THERE'S A

00:45:27.157 --> 00:45:28.392
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT WE TRY

00:45:28.459 --> 00:45:29.860
TO MAXIMIZE THE BUDGET BASED

00:45:29.927 --> 00:45:31.195
UPON THE NEED --

00:45:31.261 --> 00:45:32.362
AS MUCH AS WE CAN --

00:45:32.429 --> 00:45:35.232
WHAT WE WILL DO A LOOK AT THAT

00:45:35.299 --> 00:45:36.567

WEEK AND I'M WHAT I'M GETTING AT

00:45:40.137 --> 00:45:41.205
IS A CURIOSITY OF HOW MUCH IT IS

00:45:41.271 --> 00:45:42.172
ME AS A LEGISLATOR NOT

APPROPRIATE IN THE FUNDS TO MAKE

00:45:43.974 --> 00:45:44.975
THOSE FULLY UTILIZED.

00:45:45.042 --> 00:45:46.844
ALWAYS A BLENDOF LACK OF MARKET

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:48.479
DEMAND COUPLE WITH MAYBE SOME

00:45:48.545 --> 00:45:50.080
RENOVATIONS WITH BEDS ARE

UTILIZATION JUST STRUCK ME AS

00:46:03.827 --> 00:46:04.828
ODD BUT YOU'VE ALREADY EDUCATED

00:46:04.895 --> 00:46:09.166

01:04:04.073 --> 01:04:05.474
SUFFER THE SCA COMES AN ESSAY A

01:04:05.541 --> 01:04:07.009
EVERYTHING TO DO WITH PAYMENT IS

01:04:07.076 --> 01:04:08.444
Vl <u>&lt;c.green&gt; EVERYTHING TO DO WITH&lt;/c&gt;</u>

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:09.779
APPROVALS.

01:04:09.845 --> 01:04:13.883
IS AS A THAT DISTINCTION IS NOT

01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:15.218
SO CLEAR ALL THE TIME.

01:04:15.284 --> 01:04:16.886
A LOT OF THE THINGS WE DO THEY

01:04:16.953 --> 01:04:18.354
MIGHT NOT AGREE WITH.

01:04:18.421 --> 01:04:19.155
THEY PAY SCHOOLS THAT WE MIGHT

01:04:19.222 --> 01:04:21.757
THINK THEY SHOULD BE BUT THEY

01:04:21.824 --> 01:04:23.326
CONTROL THAT AND IN THEORY WE

01:04:23.392 --> 01:04:25.027
CONTROL.

01:04:25.094 --> 01:04:27.496
THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT.

01:04:27.563 --> 01:04:31.701
A LOT OF THERE'S A LOT OF WHEN

01:04:31.767 --> 01:04:33.035
THE RIGS ARE PUT IN PLACE

01:04:33.102 --> 01:04:34.237
FEDERALLY.

01:04:34.303 --> 01:04:37.106
THEY COULD HAVE THEY COULD BE A

01:04:37.173 --> 01:04:38.874
LITTLE CLEARER --

01:04:38.941 --> 01:04:40.610
THERE'S SOME AMBIGUITY IN

01:04:40.676 --> 01:04:41.844
DIFFERENT PARTS THAT ARE OPEN

01:04:41.911 --> 01:04:43.479
FOR INTERPRETATION TIME WE

01:04:43.546 --> 01:04:45.047
CERTAINLY DON'T.

01:04:45.114 --> 01:04:46.949
AGREE WITH THE VA ON THAT

01:04:47.016 --> 01:04:48.384
INTERPRETATION.

01:04:48.451 --> 01:04:49.785
WE'VE TAKEN STEPS WITHIN THE

01:04:49.852 --> 01:04:51.454
STATE TO DEVELOP WHAT'S CALLED A

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:52.255
REASONABLE CRITERIA WITHIN THE

01:04:52.321 --> 01:04:54.056
CONTRACT.

01:04:54.123 --> 01:04:55.725
IT WITHIN LEGISLATE WITHIN THE

01:04:55.791 --> 01:04:57.193
REGULATIONS AND SEE HOW FAR IT

01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:58.628
ALLOWS THE STATE TO DEVELOP

01:04:58.694 --> 01:04:59.895
WHAT'S CALLED --

01:04:59.962 --> 01:05:00.796
REASONABLE CRITERIA --

01:05:00.863 --> 01:05:03.599
SO SOME YEARS BACK AB TWENTY

01:05:03.666 --> 01:05:04.900
NINETY NINE WE GOT PASSED WITH

01:05:04.967 --> 01:05:06.135
YOUR SUPPORT VAN.

01:05:06.202 --> 01:05:08.638
ON THAT ALLOWED THE RECOGNIZE

01:05:08.704 --> 01:05:10.906
THAT AUTHORITY WITHIN THE STATE

01:05:10.973 --> 01:05:13.009
ITSELF -- SO

01:05:13.075 --> 01:05:14.810
WHAT THAT DOES IS THINGS THAT

01:05:14.877 --> 01:05:16.746
THE VA MIGHT NOT THINK IT'S

01:05:16.812 --> 01:05:18.247
IMPORTANT FOR SCHOOL TO DO --

01:05:18.314 --> 01:05:20.850
WE IN CALIFORNIA CAN DECIDE THAT

01:05:20.916 --> 01:05:22.418
WE DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AND

01:05:22.485 --> 01:05:25.488
THAT'S GOING TO BE --

01:05:25.554 --> 01:05:27.089
A HURDLE THAT THAT SCHOOL MUST.

01:05:27.156 --> 01:05:29.925
MUST CROSS IN ORDER TO BE

01:05:29.992 --> 01:05:32.428
APPROVED HERE IN THE STATE --

01:05:32.495 --> 01:05:34.830
THE GENERAL IS WHERE A LOT OF

01:05:34.897 --> 01:05:36.632
THE CHALLENGES WITH THE VA.

01:05:36.699 --> 01:05:38.834
HAPPEN IN THAT AREA --

01:05:38.901 --> 01:05:40.369
ADDITIONALLY ON THE FRONT AND

01:05:40.436 --> 01:05:42.538
THE ONE THING THAT THE STATE.

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:43.906
CONTROLS IF.

01:05:43.973 --> 01:05:45.574
FORTY WITHOUT QUESTION.

01:05:45.641 --> 01:05:48.778
IS IN THE APPLICATION PROCESS SO.

01:05:48.844 --> 01:05:49.412
COUPLE YEARS BACK TO VA TRIED TO

01:05:49.478 --> 01:05:52.281
STANDARDIZE THE WHICH WE FOUGHT

01:05:52.348 --> 01:05:53.516
VERY HARD AGAINST.

01:05:53.582 --> 01:05:55.051
ON THE STATE AT THIS POINT STILL

01:05:55.117 --> 01:05:56.652
HAS THE RIGHT TO PUT IN THE

01:05:56.719 --> 01:05:57.820
APPLICATION WHAT IT FEELS

01:05:57.887 --> 01:05:59.188
NECESSARY.

01:05:59.255 --> 01:06:00.323
AND WE REALIZE THAT'S THE ONE

01:06:00.389 --> 01:06:01.791
PLACE WHERE WHEN PEOPLE FIRST

01:06:01.857 --> 01:06:03.059
COME TO THE TABLE WE HAVE THE

01:06:03.125 --> 01:06:05.461
OPPORTUNITY TO TO ASK QUITE A

01:06:05.528 --> 01:06:06.829
LOT OF THEM.

01:06:06.896 --> 01:06:09.498
AND THAT INCLUDES TAX RETURNS

01:06:09.565 --> 01:06:10.633
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:12.168
ACCREDITATION REPORTS ALL THESE

01:06:12.234 --> 01:06:14.036
THINGS THAT IN THE PAST THEY HAD

01:06:14.103 --> 01:06:16.138
NEVER ASKED FOR BEFORE.

01:06:16.205 --> 01:06:17.673
ANTM.

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:18.441
SEC THAT THE POST SOME

01:06:18.507 --> 01:06:20.743
CHALLENGES AND WE WE A THE

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:22.845
SCHOOL'S OBVIOUSLY SOME OF THOSE

01:06:22.912 --> 01:06:24.313
SOME OF THAT INFORMATION.

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:26.315
MIGHT BE PRODUCT PROBLEMATIC

01:06:26.382 --> 01:06:27.917
TOWARDS THEIR APPROVAL --

01:06:27.983 --> 01:06:30.453
SO THOSE ARE GENERALLY THE BROAD

01:06:30.519 --> 01:06:32.621
BROAD AREAS OF WHERE WE WE RUN

01:06:32.688 --> 01:06:34.023
INTO.

01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:34.990
RENTED THE CHALLENGES IN THE

01:06:35.057 --> 01:06:37.326
PROCESS.

01:06:37.393 --> 01:06:39.195
SO CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT --

01:06:39.261 --> 01:06:41.797
BRIGHT WOULD DID THEY ATTEMPT --

01:06:41.864 --> 01:06:43.265
TO SUSPEND.

01:06:43.332 --> 01:06:45.167
BRIGHT WOODS SCHOOLS

01:06:45.234 --> 01:06:45.468
[inaudible]

01:06:45.534 --> 01:06:47.803
WE DID.

01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:49.939
WE DID WE WE ACTUALLY HAD JUST

01:06:50.005 --> 01:06:51.841
REINSTATED THEM.

01:06:51.907 --> 01:06:53.909
PRIOR TO THEM GOING OUT OF

01:06:53.976 --> 01:06:55.778
BUSINESS.

01:06:55.845 --> 01:06:57.580
THAT WAS DUE --

01:06:57.646 --> 01:06:59.882
TO DIRECTOR FROM THE VA --

01:06:59.949 --> 01:07:05.521
THAT REQUIRED US --

01:07:05.588 --> 01:07:07.923
TO SO WHEN A SCHOOL IS APPROVED

01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:08.758
WHAT WHEN A SCHOOL COMES US A

01:07:08.824 --> 01:07:10.493
SCHOOL HAS TO GO THROUGH CERTAIN

01:07:10.559 --> 01:07:12.128
STEPS BEFORE THEY COME TO US.

01:07:12.194 --> 01:07:12.762
IF THERE ARE CREDIT

01:07:12.828 --> 01:07:14.263
INSTITUTIONAL MISSIVE TO BE

01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:15.931
ACCREDITED IF THEY'RE

APPROPRIATELY THEY HAVE TO BE

01:07:17.733 --> 01:07:19.101
REGISTERED SECRETARY STATE THEY

01:07:19.168 --> 01:07:19.969
HAVE TO DO ALL THE DIFFERENT

01:07:20.035 --> 01:07:21.904
BUSINESS THEY HAVE TO SCHOOL

01:07:21.971 --> 01:07:22.638
MUST.

01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:24.707
ON APPROVAL WES IS PREDICATED ON

01:07:24.774 --> 01:07:27.209
APPROVAL BY THE BUREAU FOR POST

01:07:27.276 --> 01:07:29.178
SECONDARY EDUCATION.

01:07:29.245 --> 01:07:31.347
NOW WHEN WE GET THIS INFORMATION

01:07:31.414 --> 01:07:32.248
OUR APPLICATION THEIR

01:07:32.314 --> 01:07:34.283
ACCREDITATION REPORT.

INFORMATION FROM THEIR CREDIT.

01:07:40.689 --> 01:07:43.225
ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS --

01:07:43.292 --> 01:07:44.193
THEY HAVE TO DISCLOSE WHETHER

01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:45.995
THEY HAVE ANY PENDING LAWSUITS

01:07:46.061 --> 01:07:47.430
VARIETY OF DIFFERENT THINGS.

01:07:47.496 --> 01:07:48.431
THAT ARE GOING ON ALL

01:07:48.497 --> 01:07:50.599
INFORMATION THAT WE FEEL IS

01:07:50.666 --> 01:07:51.100
IMPORTANT IN MAKING THAT

01:07:51.167 --> 01:07:51.901
DETERMINATION [inaudible]

01:07:51.967 --> 01:07:54.470
OUR WE WOULD QUESTION SOME OF

01:07:54.537 --> 01:07:56.071
THAT.

01:07:56.138 --> 01:07:58.908
AND THE VA.

01:07:58.974 --> 01:08:00.776
SAID WILL BASICALLY.

01:08:00.843 --> 01:08:03.546
IF THEY'RE APPROVED BY ALL THESE

01:08:03.612 --> 01:08:05.414
OTHER ENTITIES THEN WHY DO YOU

01:08:05.481 --> 01:08:07.249
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEM.

01:08:07.316 --> 01:08:08.517
I SAID WELL BECAUSE WE'VE LOOKED

01:08:08.584 --> 01:08:10.719
AT THE INFORMATION AND THOSE

01:08:10.786 --> 01:08:13.456
ENTITIES HAVE THEM APPROVED --

01:08:13.522 --> 01:08:15.458
BUT THEY SHOULDN'T BE.

01:08:15.524 --> 01:08:16.992
IT'S SIMILAR TO CURRENT AND BACK

01:08:17.059 --> 01:08:18.661
WHEN WHEN WE PULLED CORINTHIANS

01:08:18.727 --> 01:08:20.429
APPROVAL A YEAR BEFORE THEY

01:08:20.496 --> 01:08:21.997
CLOSE THEIR DOORS ON BECAUSE

01:08:22.064 --> 01:08:23.098
WHAT WE SAW ON THE FINANCIAL

01:08:23.165 --> 01:08:24.900
STATEMENTS AND SOME OTHER ISSUES

01:08:24.967 --> 01:08:25.534
THAT WERE HAVING.

01:08:25.601 --> 01:08:26.836
THAT THEY WERE THEY WERE

01:08:26.902 --> 01:08:28.637
HEMORRHAGING MONEY AND THAT

01:08:28.704 --> 01:08:30.573
FOLKS WERE A HUGE RISK AND THAT

01:08:30.639 --> 01:08:32.608
THE END WAS NEAR.

01:08:32.675 --> 01:08:34.243
WE PULLED THEIR APPROVAL NOW BY

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:36.345
DOING SO WE SAVED VETERANS IN

01:08:36.412 --> 01:08:38.113
CALIFORNIA YEARS WORTH OF JR

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:39.915
THERE ARE IN GI BILL BENEFITS.

01:08:39.982 --> 01:08:41.150
SAME SITUATION EFFECT

01:08:41.217 --> 01:08:43.552
ACCREDITING BODY REPORTS AS THE

01:08:43.619 --> 01:08:45.154
SCHOOL'S HORRIBLE.

01:08:45.221 --> 01:08:46.489
BUT THIS DEAR CREDITOR ONCE

01:08:46.555 --> 01:08:47.122
AGAIN YOU HAVE TO THINK THEIR

01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:49.058
CREDITORS BEING PAID BY THE

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:50.192
SCHOOL.

01:08:50.259 --> 01:08:51.760
IN THEIR PROVIDE NUMBER SERVICE

01:08:51.827 --> 01:08:53.395

WELL CONFEDERATE RELATIONS SAYS

01:08:59.001 --> 01:09:02.271
THAT SCHOOL IS APPROVED FOR C.

01:09:02.338 --> 01:09:03.672
SAFE AT ALL TIMES.

01:09:03.739 --> 01:09:05.107

CHOSE YOUR PAPERWORK AND SHOW

01:09:15.885 --> 01:09:17.553
THAT ALL THOSE --

01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:20.055
DEFICIENCIES OF IN MATT WOULD BE

01:09:20.122 --> 01:09:20.656
MORE THAN HAPPY TO APPROVE YOU

01:09:20.723 --> 01:09:21.257
AGAIN --

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:23.425
THAT DOES NOT GO OVER VERY WELL --

01:09:23.492 --> 01:09:24.660
BRIGHT WOOD WAS ONE OF THOSE

01:09:24.727 --> 01:09:26.395
SITUATIONS ACTUALLY THERE WAS

01:09:26.462 --> 01:09:28.364
ABOUT TWELVE SCHOOLS.

01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:29.365
OVER THE SUMMER THERE WAS A

01:09:29.431 --> 01:09:31.033
LAWSUIT INVOLVED THERE'S A LOT

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:34.336
OF ISSUES AROUND THAT BUT BRIGHT

01:09:34.403 --> 01:09:36.672
WHAT IN PARTICULAR SO DIED

01:09:36.739 --> 01:09:38.440
STALKS THE VA AND SAID WELL.

01:09:38.507 --> 01:09:39.875
IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN YOU IN

01:09:39.942 --> 01:09:41.644
IS VERY AT THE VERY LEAST NEED

01:09:41.710 --> 01:09:42.811
TO PUT THAT IN WRITING.

01:09:42.878 --> 01:09:45.648
SO THEY PUT OUT A OF A NATIONAL

01:09:45.714 --> 01:09:47.716
DIRECTIVE OF SORTS --

01:09:47.783 --> 01:09:49.718
STATING THE FOLLOWING WHICH IT'S

01:09:49.785 --> 01:09:50.886
QUESTIONABLE I GUESS THERE'S

01:09:50.953 --> 01:09:52.354
FOLKS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ARGUING

01:09:52.421 --> 01:09:53.455
OUT WHETHER.

01:09:53.522 --> 01:09:54.690
THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO WRITE

01:09:54.757 --> 01:09:57.126
THAT DIRECTIVE OR NOT BUT IT

01:09:57.192 --> 01:09:59.295
CERTAINLY WAS.

01:09:59.361 --> 01:10:02.164
WAS ENOUGH OF A DIRECTION TO US

01:10:02.231 --> 01:10:04.400
WE NEEDED TO COMPLY.

01:10:04.466 --> 01:10:06.135
OM.

01:10:06.201 --> 01:10:07.069
AT RISK OF LOSING THE STATE

01:10:07.136 --> 01:10:09.939
CONTRACT IF WE FAILED TO COMPLY.

01:10:10.005 --> 01:10:12.341
SO WE DID ARM.

01:10:12.408 --> 01:10:13.709
IN BRIGHTWOOD WENT OUT OF

01:10:13.776 --> 01:10:15.611
BUSINESS A FEW WEEKS LATER.

01:10:15.678 --> 01:10:17.546
WHICH I MEAN THE THE BOTTOM LINE

01:10:17.613 --> 01:10:18.547
THE STORY COULD HAVE GONE MUCH

01:10:18.614 --> 01:10:21.050
WORSE THAN THAT SO FORTUNATELY

01:10:21.116 --> 01:10:22.751
ONE OR THE OTHER ON VETERANS OF

01:10:22.818 --> 01:10:24.386
THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT

01:10:24.453 --> 01:10:25.955
BENEFITTED A SCHOOL THAT'S GOING.

01:10:26.021 --> 01:10:26.922
TO THAT'S GOING TO BE OF SOME

01:10:26.989 --> 01:10:28.724
VALUE DOWN THE ROAD BUT IT'S

01:10:28.791 --> 01:10:30.259
THERE'S A LOT OF THOSE TYPES OF

HAVE THAT OPTION --

01:12:00.516 --> 01:12:02.618
DUE TO THE COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT

WEEDS WITH THAT BUT MORE OR LESS

01:12:16.765 --> 01:12:18.267
THE LAW SAYS YOU HAVE OPTIONS A.

01:12:18.333 --> 01:12:20.669
B. AND C. AND THE V. A SANE

01:12:20.736 --> 01:12:21.937
WORLD BASED ON OUR COOPERATIVE

01:12:22.004 --> 01:12:23.305

YOU OPTIONS A AND B. SO --

01:12:25.541 --> 01:12:27.242
IT'S IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS

01:12:27.309 --> 01:12:28.677
THAT ARE STILL YET TO BE WORKED

01:12:28.744 --> 01:12:30.145
OUT BUT ASHFORD AS YOU KNOW IS

01:12:30.212 --> 01:12:33.615
ON IT MAY NOW IT'S THEIR

01:12:33.682 --> 01:12:34.983
CURRENTLY HAVE A VARIETY OF LOS

01:12:35.050 --> 01:12:36.318
IT'S GOING ON NATIONWIDE WITH A

01:12:36.385 --> 01:12:38.020
VARIETY OF ATTORNEY GENERAL'S

01:12:38.087 --> 01:12:39.321
INCLUDING OUR OWN.

01:12:39.388 --> 01:12:41.256
SO BASICALLY THAT THAT NOTICE OF

01:12:41.323 --> 01:12:43.158
INTENT NOT TO ACT IS REALLY IT'S

01:12:43.225 --> 01:12:45.227
KIND OF THE FAIR THING TO DO --

01:12:45.294 --> 01:12:46.695
IT WOULD BE PREMATURE OF US TO

01:12:46.762 --> 01:12:48.564
APPROVE ASHFORD'S INFORMATION

01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:50.165
ARE ARE DECLINE OR SAY THEY

01:12:50.232 --> 01:12:51.700
DON'T MEET THE STANDARDS NOT

01:12:51.767 --> 01:12:53.202
KNOWING WHAT.

01:12:53.268 --> 01:12:55.404
THAT LAWSUIT IS GONNA TURN OUT

01:12:55.471 --> 01:12:56.238
TO BE.

01:12:56.305 --> 01:12:57.406
ARM AND IT WOULD KIND OF BE A

01:12:57.473 --> 01:12:58.474
DERELICTION OF OUR DUTY TO

01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:00.075
APPROVE THEM --

01:13:00.142 --> 01:13:01.310
NOT KNOWING HOW THE LAWSUIT

01:13:01.376 --> 01:13:03.378
TURNS OUT AS WELL SO THIS PART

01:13:03.445 --> 01:13:05.280
OF THE CODE ALLOWS FOR A STATE

01:13:05.347 --> 01:13:07.483
UPROOTING SHE TO REFER THIS BACK

01:13:07.549 --> 01:13:08.283
TO THE VA.

01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:10.085
ON WHICH THEN THE ASHFORD DOES

01:13:10.152 --> 01:13:11.186
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE

01:13:11.253 --> 01:13:12.821

01:13:23.766 --> 01:13:25.134
STATE VERY CLEARLY THE VA AT

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.635
THAT POINT WOULD BE --

01:13:26.702 --> 01:13:28.737
REQUIRED TO HAVE THE FTC OR

01:13:28.804 --> 01:13:30.239
ANOTHER AGENCY --

01:13:30.305 --> 01:13:31.974

FOR MY AND JUST AND JUST ADD

01:16:48.937 --> 01:16:50.405
THAT'S KIND IT TO ANSWER YOUR

01:16:50.472 --> 01:16:51.907
QUESTION MORE SPECIFICALLY

01:16:51.974 --> 01:16:52.941
THAT'S HOW WE GET TO THAT NUMBER

01:16:53.008 --> 01:16:53.442
IS.

01:16:53.508 --> 01:16:54.810
THAT NUMBER HE TALKED ABOUT HIS

01:16:54.876 --> 01:16:56.311
ON SHELTERED THE THE POINT TIME

01:16:56.378 --> 01:16:58.714
COUNT THAT TAKES PLACE AT THE

01:16:58.780 --> 01:16:59.948
END OF THIS MONTH BOMB.

01:17:00.015 --> 01:17:01.817
BASICALLY GIVES YOU WHAT ON

01:17:01.883 --> 01:17:03.585
SHELTERED MEANS IS THAT GOING TO

01:17:03.652 --> 01:17:04.486
THING THEY SAY THE SOME THE

01:17:04.553 --> 01:17:05.153
HOMELESS FOLKS THEY HAVE IN THIS

01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:06.221
AREA THIS IS HOW MANY ON SHELTER

01:17:06.288 --> 01:17:07.689
ON SHELTER IS THE NUMBER WHEN

01:17:07.756 --> 01:17:08.690

AVAILABLE HOUSING OPTIONS.

01:17:13.595 --> 01:17:15.831
HOW WHAT'S THE SHORTFALL THERE --

01:17:15.897 --> 01:17:17.366
AND THEN YOU GET A NUMBER SO

01:17:17.432 --> 01:17:21.903
CHEN IS AROUND SIX OR SEVEN

01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:23.438
THOUSAND FOR THE STATE GENERALLY

IT WENT UP A LITTLE LAST YEAR.

01:17:26.675 --> 01:17:28.844

01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:30.379
WE PUT OUT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION

01:17:30.445 --> 01:17:31.279
AROUND.

01:17:31.346 --> 01:17:32.781
THE NEXT NO FOR IS TO BE

01:17:32.848 --> 01:17:35.283
RELEASED IN THE FALL SO THAT

01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:36.318
WOULD BE A GRANTING PERIOD

01:17:36.385 --> 01:17:38.086
SOMETIME AROUND THIS TIME NEXT

01:17:38.153 --> 01:17:39.254

LEFT ON MAYBE TWO MORE ROUNDS

01:17:48.964 --> 01:17:50.465
