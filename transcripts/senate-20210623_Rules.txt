I DO HAVE A STATEMENT. WITH AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I AM DOCTOR TOMASZ UNDERGONE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER AND DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO THANK GOVERNOR NEWSOM FOR THIS INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY I HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO SERVE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. IN THIS MOST IMPORTANT TIME IN PUBLIC HEALTH. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE RULES COMMITTEE AND LEGISLATIVE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK IN THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS. I AM HONORED AND HUMBLED TO BE BEFORE YOU TODAY. IT IS AN UNPRECEDENTED TIME FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND FOR OUR COUNTRY. THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC REVEALED AN AMPLIFIED SOCIAL GEOGRAPHIC AND RACIAL ETHNIC DISPARITIES AND EXPOSURES AND HEALTH OUTCOMES THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED COMMUNITIES ACROSS OUR STATE. I AM COMMITTED TO PROTECTING AND IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF ALL CALIFORNIANS BUT WITH MY HIGHEST PRIORITY FOCUSED ON ELIMINATING HEALTH INEQUITIES. AS WE MOVE TOWARDS COVERED RECOVERY I'M COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH IN ORDER TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES NVM AND THE RESILIENCY OF OUR PEOPLE FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. I WILL LEAD AND MOBILIZED ACROSS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PAGE PROGRAMS TO BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS. AND THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE PARTICULARLY ADDRESSING GROWING PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS. ALSO TO ALIGN THOSE PROGRAMS AROUND SHARED PRIORITIES AND TO ENSURE THAT THE DEPARTMENT'S WORK IS TARGETED TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF THE STATE. I INTEND TO FOSTER OPEN COMMUNICATION NOT ONLY WITH A LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS BUT ALSO WITH MANY STAKEHOLDERS TO REPRESENT THE PEOPLE WE SERVE. I AM COMMITTED TO OUR MISSION AND TO THE HEALTH OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. DR THANK YOU SO MUCH- SENATOR KAMLAGER WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO AHEAD GO FIRST SINCE YOU'RE ON THE HEALTH COMMITTEE AND IN CASE YOU HAVE TO LEAVE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN- DR ED ARE GONE WE HAD A VERY- GOOD DISCUSSION EARLIER TODAY AND- I JUST ALSO WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR YOUR- COMMITMENT TO THE SPACE OF PUBLIC HEALTH- ONE OF THE THINGS. WE TALKED ABOUT WAS- HOW PUBLIC HEALTH TENDS TO FLY UNDER THE RADAR. WHEN YOU SAID YOU KNOW WHEN NOTHING HAPPENS OF COURSE NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH AND THEN WHEN SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS. THERE'S A LOT OF TALK BUT THEN THEY'RE ALSO ALL OF THE SORT OF CATEGORICAL FUNDING REQUESTS THAT POP UP- IN YOUR- THANKFUL FOR THAT BUT ALSO WANTING US TO CONSIDER INVESTING IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC HEALTH SO. I WOULD LIKE FOR YOU TO KIND OF EXPAND ON THAT AND IF THERE WAS MORE FLEXIBILITY WHICH WAS SOMETHING THAT YOU MENTIONED. YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU SEE YOUR ROLE IN ENSURING- THAT OUR LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS- THAT YOU WORK SO CLOSELY WITH- ARE ABLE TO SERVE THEIR POPULATIONS EQUALLY AND FAIRLY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS QUESTION. THIS IS REALLY A SPECIAL HIGH RIGHT NOW IN PUBLIC HEALTH ONE OF THE CHALLENGES I'VE HAD OVER THE YEARS IS TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT PUBLIC HEALTH IS. AND PUBLIC HEALTH IS REALLY FOCUSING ON BUILDING HEALTHY COMMUNITIES AND ALL PRIMARY PREVENTION WHICH IS WHICH TO ME IS THIS WHERE I WANT TO PREVENT THINGS FROM HAPPENING AND OF COURSE AS YOU SAID NGUYEN FELT NOTHING HAPPENS PEOPLE DON'T APPRECIATE PUBLIC HEALTH WHICH IS GOING TO BE CLEAN AIR SAFE WATER EXCEPT ECCENTRIC. SO THE PANDEMIC REALLY REVEALED HOW IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH AS PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THAT WHEN YOU PREVENT TRANSMISSION OF CULTIVATED. YOU CAN PREVENT NOT JUST CASES HOSPITALIZATIONS AND DEATH BUT YOU CAN PREVENT THE COLLAPSE OF OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT WOULD IMPACT SO MANY SO MANY PEOPLE. FELT UNFORTUNATELY OVER TO OVER TIME WHEN AFTER SELLS DISASTERS HAVE HAPPENED THERE IS AN INFUSION OF. CATEGORICAL DOLLARS TO DEAL WITH THAT ISSUE BUT OVER TIME THOSE CATEGORICAL DOLLARS GO AWAY AND PUBLIC HEALTH NEEDS IS ONGOING ONGOING FUNDING COULD DEAL WITH THAT CORE INFRASTRUCTURE OF PUBLIC HEALTH THE CATEGORICAL DOLLARS OFTENTIMES DON'T GIVE US THE FLEXIBILITY TO BE ABLE TO PIVOT AND TO DEAL WITH EMERGING PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEMS SO WE NEED A CORE FUNCTIONAL CAPABILITIES TO BE TO BE FUNDED AND A CORE AREA IS GOING TO BE. FOR EXAMPLE IS JUST AN EMERGENCY PREPARED EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS- WE NEED TO TAKE A MORE REGIONAL APPROACH TO WORK MORE CLOSELY WITH THAT LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND REALLY BALANCED THE NEEDS THEY DO WHAT THEY DO WHAT THEY DO BEST WHICH IS REALLY WORKING CLOSELY WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND WE WORK GOOD AT THE REGIONAL AT THE STATE LEVEL USING ECONOMIES OF SCALE TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE LOCAL HEALTH. COULD BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THE OTHER MAJOR AREA WHERE WE NEED- IMPROVEMENT AND CORE PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE IS IN THE AREA OF BEHAVIORAL. HEALTH WE KNOW THAT THE PANDEMIC. IS AND WILL HAVE A LARGE MENTAL AND BEHAVIOR HEALTH IMPACT ESPECIALLY ON THE YOUNGEST IN CALIFORNIA. AND THAT'S A PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH FOCUSING ON PREVENTION AGAIN WHERE WE REALLY NEED TO IMPROVE OUR CAPABILITIES. AND THE LAST AREA THAT I WANT TO MENTION IT IS GOING TO BE JUST IN OUR AREA OF OUR LABORATORY CAPACITY. OUR SURVEILLANCE UPDATING OUR IT SYSTEMS WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO BECOME TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND IN TERMS OF OUR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO. DELIVER PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES FOR FORTY MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AND SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT I WOULD I WOULD I WOULD FOCUS ON. GREAT THANK YOU FOR THAT- YOU WE ALSO ENDED UP. TALKING ABOUT SEX AND DRUGS AND I DIDN'T THINK WE WERE GONNA TALK ABOUT THAT- IN PREPPING FOR THIS MEETING BUT- THE WE TALKED ABOUT THE INCREASE ACTUALLY IN S. T. D.'S AND SEEING AN EXPLOSION WITH SOME OF THOSE NUMBERS- AS I MENTIONED AT LEAST WITH HEPATITIS. AB I BELIEVE IT IS- AT LEAST SEVEN HUNDRED FOLKS WERE INFECTED IN TWENTY ONE DIED FROM THAT VIRUS IN LA YOU SEEN DIEGO AND IN SANTA CRUZ AND AS- LUCK WOULD HAVE IT- THREE OF THE MEMBERS OF RULES. ACTUALLY REPRESENT THOSE- AREAS SO YOU'VE GOT THAT AND THEN YOU ALSO HAVE THIS EXPLOSION. OF STD RATES FOR SYPHILIS GONORRHEA AND CHLAMYDIA- YOU KNOW WHEN I ASKED YOU IF WE WERE READY FOR THIS I MEAN DO WE HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE- AND THE CAPACITY- TO DEAL WITH S. AND THEN OF COURSE WE MOVED IN TO. OPIOIDS AND THE IMPACT THAT THAT IS ALSO HAVING SOMETIMES ON THE SAME COMMUNITIES. SO WANTED TO GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THAT IS TO JUST ASK YOU PUBLICLY. HOW WE ARE GOING TO MANAGE THIS EXPLOSION AND IF WE ARE READY. SO THERE'S CERTAIN THERE'S SEVERAL SEVERAL ISSUES THERE THE FIRST ONE HAVING TO DO WITH SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES SO WE DON'T HAVE BEFORE THE COVERED PANDEMIC THERE WAS A LARGE INCREASE IN SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES. ESPECIALLY SYPHILIS GONORRHEA CHLAMYDIA AND THEN CONGENITAL SYPHILIS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE'VE HAD NOW WITH KHALID. IS THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DELIVER THE SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF SCREENING AND TREATMENT OF SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES AND IN FACT I WAS LOOKING AT THE DATA TODAY. AND SOME OF THE DATA SHOWS THAT THERE IS A SLIGHT DECREASE AND I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE WE DON'T. WE HAVEN'T HAD SUFFICIENT TESTING RIGHT NOW SO AS WE RECOVER FROM COLD MAYBE REALLY HAVE TO GET OUR SCREENING AND OUR TESTING INFRASTRUCTURE BOB. YEAH OTHER IMPORTANT AREA WITH SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES IS AND KANSEN VISITATION AND CONTACT TRACING. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. LOCALS HAVE LIMITED STAFF TO DO THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE LEARNED WITH CALLS MADE IS THAT WE CAN REALLY SUPPORT- CASE INVESTIGATION AND CONTACT TRACING OUT A DISTANCE. USING A MODERN SOFTWARE SO WE NOW HAVE A VERY SOPHISTICATED DATA BASE THAT ALLOWS US TO DO. CONTACT TRACING FOR COPD PATIENTS THAT SAME INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE'VE NOW INVESTED CAN NOW BE USED TO SUPPORT LOCALS. AROUND SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES. SOME OF THE SOME THE VERY FOR. ON THE AREA OF DECEMBER. GONNA READ AND COULD GENERAL'S. SOME OF THESE ARE DO SEE THAT GO UNTREATED OFTEN TEND TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE ADDICTED TO DRUGS. WHO WHO WELL I TRADE A SEX FOR DRUGS OR OTHER RESOURCES. AND WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT THEY DON'T GET THEY DON'T GET DIAGNOSED THEY DON'T GET TREATED AND THEN YOU HAVE CASES OF CONGENITAL SYPHILIS LAST HAS BEN DECREASING. OVER TIME- WHAT WE KNOW FROM THE DATA THAT'S BEEN PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH- WOMEN WHO USE METHAMPHETAMINE. BOB SO THE OPIOID OVER THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC IS IT IS AN ISSUE THAT IT'S A SORT OF A SEPARATE TOPIC WHICH IS CONNECTED. WITH ANOTHER ISSUE THAT OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY AND RIGHT NOW WITHOUT A FENTANYL AND METHAMPHETAMINE AND POLY SUBSTANCE USE. IT'S BEEN A- A BIG ISSUE. AND I'M I'M HAPPY TO. GOING TO MORE DETAIL BUT I DON'T WANT TO TAKE TOO MUCH TIME. NO NO IT SOME THANK YOU FOR THAT AND- IT'S IT WAS STARTLING FOR ME TO ACTUALLY HEAR THAT WHEN YOU WHEN I TALK TO BECAUSE I THINK IT REALLY PUTS INTO PERSPECTIVE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO HAVE A SOLID. PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S REACHING- THROUGHOUT EVERY DISTRICT AND COMMUNITY- THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO MAKE SURE FOLKS HAVE WHAT THEY NEED. I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO TAKE UP MUCH MORE TIME. FROM MY OTHER COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE QUESTIONS BUT I DO KNOW THAT DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. IS RESPONSIBLE FOR- A REGULATING MORE THAN TWELVE HUNDRED SNAPS AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE ALSO FOCUS ON OUR- ELDERLY POPULATION- THERE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT IF WE WILL HAVE A SNIFF SHORTAGE. THERE ARE CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE KIND OF TREATMENT THAT OUR ELDERS ARE GETTING IN THESE FACILITIES- AND SO WELL YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO RESPOND- IT'S A SOMETHING OF GREAT IMPORTANCE BECAUSE AS I'M SO MANY OF US ARE THINKING ABOUT OUR GRANDMOTHERS OR GRANDFATHERS ARE FOLKS THAT WE KNOW IN THE COMMUNITY WHO ARE AGING. OR IN NEED OF- THESE KINDS OF FACILITIES WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A STATE THAT IS EQUALLY INVESTED. IN MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH OF THEM AND THAT THEY ARE FULLY OPERATIONAL AND THAT THEY ARE PROVIDING THE KIND OF CARE. THAT WE EXPECT- SO YOU CAN CERTAINLY RESPOND IF YOU WANT TO BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS TIME. ALSO SINCE YOU'RE SAYING WELL- JUST A VERY QUICK COMMENTED THAT AND THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WE USE DESCRIBING IS A DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFT. WHERE WE HAVE AN AGING POPULATION. SO THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING FOR CALIFORNIA WAS JUST PUBLISHED IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING IS REALLY LEADING THE STATEWIDE EFFORTS IN THAT AREA- AND THERE IS. A BUDGET FROM THE MAY REVISION THAT WAS JUST PUBLISHED IN WILL MAKE SURE THAT YOU WEEK WE SEND THAT OVER TO YOU. BECAUSE INTO DETAIL WHAT THE PROPOSALS ARE- FOR THAT. THESE VERY AREAS THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR A MAN BY SHARE. THANK YOU A DOCTOR AGAIN LET ME A JUMP ON WITH OF THE COMPLIMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES REGARDING YOU TAKING THIS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT POSITION IN AND SW ONE OF THOSE FRONTLINE WARRIOR POSITIONS AND WE KNOW THAT DODD THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS HAVE BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES AND PROBABLY HAVE HAD A LOT OF BLOW BACK ON SOME OF THE DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE UP. IN NEEDED TO BE MADE IN AND NOW I'M IN A VERY QUICK TURNAROUND AS WE THOUGHT COALBED SWEEP THROUGH OUR COMMUNITIES AND DO THE DEVASTATION SO I THANK YOU FOR BEING ONE OF THOSE WARRIORS AND JUMPING INTO THIS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT POSITION AND NOW CONGRATULATIONS FOR BEING RECOGNIZED WITH YOUR RESUME FOR BEING VERY QUALIFIED FOR THE POSITION. I DO HAVE- I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP VERY QUICKLY ON SOMETHING BROUGHT UP ON THE OPIOID THING I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THAT IT SINCE- I. ACTUALLY WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY WITH A DRUG CALLED ECSTASY I HAD TO PAY A BILL ON THAT I DIDN'T GET TOO FAR BECAUSE THERE IS SOME CONCERN ABOUT CRIMINALIZING DRUGS TOO OFTEN- SO I'D LIKE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE DECRIMINALIZATION OF DRUGS THERE IS A POSITIVE SIDE TO THAT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE BUT THERE'S ANOTHER SIDE TO IT. THAT OPENS UP A WHOLE WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE A PANDORA'S BOX OF IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW ENCOURAGING DRUG USE IN THE PARTY SCENE AND THAT'S WHERE WE'VE SEEN I THINK A LOT OF THE UNFORTUNATE CONSEQUENCES OF FAN MAIL GETTING LACED INTO OPIOIDS- I KNOW I WAS A SOCIAL WORKER DURING THE CON DR LEARY. IN GENERATION AND I INTERVIEWED MANY YOUNG PEOPLE AT THAT TIME WHO WERE- INTO LSD AND UNFORTUNATELY HAD A LOT OF BRAIN DAMAGE BECAUSE OF THAT SO I HAVE KIND OF MIXED EMOTIONS ABOUT THE WHOLE THING AND WANT TO BE. ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE DECRIMINALIZATION ACROSS THEIR RESEARCH. EVERY SPECTER OF THEIR FEAR OF CONCERN TO ME- ABOUT YOU FOR MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT QUESTIONS IS A IMPORTANT QUESTION AND ALSO TO ADDRESS SEVERAL DIFFERENT ISSUES ONE ISSUE IS- FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO START OFF WITH FIRST JUST TALKING ABOUT USE AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR US TO PROTECT YOU IF. THE DEBT DEVELOPING MIND OF USE IN ADOLESCENCE WHEN IT GETS EXPOSED TO REALLY ANYTHING ANYTIME ANY TYPE OF DRUG THAT CAN ALTER THE NEURAL CHEMISTRY REALLY PROCESS O THE POTENTIAL FOR USED TO BE ADDICTED TO SUBSTANCES TO PROTECT OUR YOUTH IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WHETHER SOMETHING IS DECRIMINALIZED LEGAL ILLEGAL IT DOESN'T MATTER- SO FOR EXAMPLE WE DON'T WANT KIDS SMOKING WE DON'T WANT WE DON'T WANT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. ARE CONSUMING CONSUMING CANNABIS THE SECOND ISSUE YOU BROUGHT UP WITH THE ISSUE OF YOU MENTIONED FENTANYL FENTANYL HAS REALLY TRANSFORMED WHAT'S HAPPENED AROUND OPIOID ADDICTION- I WAS MENTIONING EARLIER THAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE NOW WHAT PEOPLE ARE DESCRIBING AS FOUR WAVES OF THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC WITH THE FIRST WAS A PRESCRIPTION OF CHILD ARE PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS. AND WE HAD HERE WHEN THEN WE HAVE FOUND SMALL AND NOW WE'RE IN THIS NEW PHASE WHERE WE HAVE FENTANYL AND POLY SUBSTANCE USE AND MAXINE AND ADULTERATION IT IS BECAUSE IT'S BECOME SO DANGEROUS AT ANY STREET DRAW CAN BE CAN BE ADULTERATED WITH FAT AND ALSO IT'S BECOMING INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS FOR ANYBODY TO BE. TO BE EXACT- EXPERIMENTING WITH ANY TYPE OF DRUG USE BECAUSE BECAUSE PHANTOM OF THE OTHER BIG CHALLENGING HALF WITH FENTANYL IS THAT IT'S SYNTHETIC AND THERE ARE OVER TWO HUNDRED ANALOG IT'S INCREDIBLY CHEAP HIGHLY ADDICTIVE AND VERY DEADLY AND SO ON IT'S ALL AYE AYE AYE DESCRIBED IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE VARIANCE WITH KOBE. NINETEEN IT'S FIGURED OUT HOW TO REALLY. PENETRATE ARE POPULAR AND I THINK THE LONG TERM. YES REALLY GOING BACK AND REALLY FOR. ON YOUTH WE REALLY HAVE TO AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE DECREASE DEMAND. AND THEN YOU MEANT MENTIONED THE ISSUE OF DECRIMINALIZATION I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT A THREE. THREE WAYS ONE IS. ONE IS OF COURSE DECRIMINALIZATION WHERE YOU DON'T PUT PEOPLE IN PRISON BECAUSE THEY ARE EXPERIMENTING TO USE IN A TRIBE. THE OTHER CATEGORIES LEGAL LEGALIZATION- WE SAW CANNABIS WAS WE SAW CANNABIS THAT WAS LEGALIZED SO THAT YOU CAN PRODUCE YOU CAN PRODUCE EIGHT EIGHT. TRUCK THAT'S CAN BE CONSUMED MOSTLY SAFETY BY ADULTS. BEYOND BEYOND LEGALIZATION IS WHAT A PUBLIC HEALTH WE CALL COMMERCIALIZATION WHICH IS NOT PROMOTING OF A DRIVE BASICALLY FOR CONSUMPTION AND PROFITS. AND IN PUBLIC HEALTH WE REALLY TRY TO FOCUS ON WHAT IS GOING TO WHAT IS GOING TO. REALLY I HAVE CREATE THE LEAST HARM IS GOING TO BE THE MOST HEALTH PROTECTIVE. SO AND THAT'S REALLY THE WAY THAT WE THINK WITH THE WITH THE WAY THAT WE THINK ABOUT IT REPRIEVE PUBLIC HEALTH FOLKS IN GENERAL WILL STICK WITH OUR SMALL SUPPORT DECRIMINALIZATION. AND LEGALIZATION WE BECOME CONCERNED WITH SOMETHING BECAUSE IT'S FOCUSED ON COMMERCIALIZATION AND IS PROMOTING A PRODUCT THAT HAS BEEN ADDICTIVE POTENTIAL ESPECIALLY WITH MAJOR TRACTIVE TO USE- AND SO THAT'S WHERE WE GET WE GET VERY COMES WE GET VERY CONCERNED ABOUT I THINK THAT'S PART OF WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING IN TERMS OF- UNFORTUNATELY- PROMOTING. DRUG USE. THAT EXPOSES PEOPLE TO THAT RISK. THANK YOU FOR THE LAW PHONE THOSE RESPONSES MAKE IT DOES GIVE ME HOPE THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT ANY IN A MULTI. FACETED WAY BECAUSE THERE'S THERE ARE CONCERNS THAT UNDERLIE IT AND I THINK WHEN WE WERE WHEN WE STARTED TO ADVERTISE DRUGS FONG. THROUGH THE MEDIA ON TV I MEAN- THERE'S A DRUG FOR EVERY SINGLE LITTLE THING YOU HAVE THAT EVERYONE OF THOSE. HAS SOME HORRIBLE- CONSEQUENCES AND IF WE START PROMOTING BUT WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES ARE MAYBE WE'RE GOING TO SAY WEL I DON'T NEED THAT YOU KNOW I'LL JUST TAKE AN ASPIRIN TONIGHT OR WHATEVER. BUT ANYWAY- ARE JUMPING TO ANOTHER SUBJECT- REGARDING THE MONITORING OF THE VARIANTS THAT WE ARE NOW STARTING TO SEE POP UP- HOW IS THE DEPARTMENT- TAKING MONITORING THOSE IN OUR COMMUNITY AND IT WHERE THERE ARE VACCINES ARE. YOU KNOW EFFECTIVE AGAINST THEM AND WHETHER OR NOT WE WILL NEED BOOSTER SHOTS IF WE HAVE BEEN VACCINATED OF. THESE THINGS MAYBE. GAIN TRACTION OR GAIN STRENGTH. I. THAT GOOD COURSE OF RIGHT NOW FORTUNATELY THE BACK THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED IN THE IN THE UNITED STATES ARE VERY EFFECTIVE AGAINST ITALIANS IT IS IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO COMPLETE THEIR SERIES. AREAS THAT WERE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS CALLED THE DELTA VARIANTS. THAT WAS ORIGINALLY- IDENTIFIED IN ENGLAND RIGHT NOW IT'S ABOUT 6% AND ERA IN THE I'M SORRY ABOUT THIS IT'S ABOUT. 10% IN THE UNITED STATES IN ABOUT 6% OF THE ICE LOOKS RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE DELTA VARIANT IS INCREDIBLY INFECTIOUS MUCH MORE INFECTIOUS STANDARDIZED IT- VERY AND THAT WAS KINDA CAME OUT OF THE THAT THE YOU CAN WHICH IS CALLED THAT. THE ALPHA VARIANT WHICH HAD TAKEN OVER PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES BUT NOW WE SEE THE DELTA VERY INCREASING AND THERE'S SOME CONCERN THAT ACTUALLY MAKE PEOPLE SICKER. SO YES WE ARE VERY GOOD WE'RE VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT- THE DELTA VARIANCE AGAIN FORTUNATELY THE VACCINES ARE VERY EFFECTIVE. WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN CALIFORNIA- WE'RE NOW I'M MORE THAN 70% OF THE POPULATION HAS RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOES WORK. WE'RE IN MUCH BETTER SHAPE THAN MOST OTHER STATES HOWEVER THERE ARE POCKETS OF CALIFORNIA BUT WE STILL WANT IT WE SAW A LOT MORE. PEOPLE TO GET OUT. I VACCINATED. YEAH THERE IS BROUGHT UP WAS THE ISSUE. IT'S TOO SOON TO TELL WE'RE GONNA REQUIRE BOOSTERS. SOURCE CODE OF THE VIRUS. DOES NOT MUTATE AS FREQUENTLY AS THE INFLUENZA A VIRUS- AND IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THIS THE VACCINE WILL ACTUALLY GIVE US LONGER LASTING PROTECTION WE DON'T KNOW YET. WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO FOLLOW UP AND- TEST PEOPLE TO SEE HOW LONG IMMUNITY IS LASTING. BUT IF WE DO NEED A BOOSTER IT'S UNLIKELY TO BE LIKE INFLUENZA WE HAVE AN ANNUAL BOOSTER TO PROBABLY BE A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. BUT IT'LL TAKE IT'LL TAKE SOME TIME TO REALLY SORT THAT OUT. THANK YOU WOULD THAT MEAN THAT WHEN YOU GET YOUR ANNUAL PHYSICAL AND YOU GET A BLOOD TEST THIRDS DETERMINING WHETHER YOU DO HAVE. ANTIBODIES IN THEIR- IF YOU'VE BEEN VACCINATED IS ABOUT. YEAH SO YOU KNOW HISTORICALLY. PEOPLE HAVE LOOKED AT THE- ALL. BUT DOCTOR YOU MIGHT IF YOU CAN HEAR ME YOU MIGHT STOP FOR A MINUTE. ALSO AND THEN WE HAVE HE SELLS BETTER THAN T. CELLS THAT- THAT PROVIDE WAS CALLED- CELLULAR IMMUNITY AND IS ACTUALLY LONG LASTING AND IS VERY EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING SEVERE DISEASE- SO THAT'S REALLY THE IT'S REALLY THE COMBINATION OF BOTH CLOSE TO SO- ANTIBODIES WANE OVER TIME TO GO DOWN. BUT THE MODERN TECHNOLOGY CAN THAT HAPPEN THAT CAN NOW LOOK AT T. CELLS I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE RESEARCHERS WILL BE LOKING AT WILL BE LOOKING TO SEE WHETHER WE HAVE. BOTH THE BODY AND CELLULAR IMMUNITY ABOUT SLAMBALL THAT LONG LASTING AND IF THAT IS. AND THAT'S THAT'S FANTASTIC NOW AFTER FLUID WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT LISTEN IN VIA APPRECIATED OUT SO I CAN RESPOND TO. YOU KNOW SOME OF MY CONSTITUENTS OF ON ON THE FULL ISSUE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SPONSORS AND AGAIN CONGRATULATIONS ON A WELL DESERVED APPOINTMENT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR ARE REALLY GOOD AND PRACTICAL QUESTIONS I THINK. OF THE SENATOR LIAR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY CHAIR. THANK YOU FOR THE TIME I BY. REALLY APPRECIATED IT AND I THINK. MAYBE I WOULD ASK A GLOBAL. STRIKES ARE BECAUSE YOU OF. YOU'VE GOT TO BE THE ONLY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT GOT A MASTERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH GOT AN EMPTY AND GOT A PHD IN PUBLIC HEALTH THE ANSWER FOR TEN YEARS AS A PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER AFTER MANY YEARS IN. IT IS IN OUR PUBLIC ROLES AND IN TALKING TO YOU. YOU FOR SHOWED UP IN YOUR CAREER IN SAN FRANCISCO AT THE HEART OF THE HIV EPIDEMIC BEFORE THE DRUG COCKTAIL WHERE. SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL WAS GROUND ZERO. AND THEN YOU GET APPOINTED. YOU'RE YOU'RE IN THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER POSITION WHEN THE PANDEMIC BREAKS OUT. THEN YOU'RE POINTED TO THE STATE POSITION IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PANDEMIC AT THE TIME OF SURGE. AND THEN YOU LIST AS ONE OF YOUR PRIORITIES EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS SO WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM THESE DIFFERENT TOP- DRAMATIC EXPERIENCES IN YOUR WORK CAREER. THAT WOULD INFORM WHAT DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE DOING US A STATE OF EMERGENCY. UPPER PEREGRINUS AGAINST ANY FUTURE SUCH SITUATIONS- REALLY REALLY GOOD QUESTION YEAH I THINK I EVEN MENTIONED THAT I ALSO DID I RAN A CDC TRAINING CENTER RESEARCH CENTER AT UC BERKELEY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH FOCUSING ON INFECTIOUS DISEASE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS I SPENT ALMOST A YEAR IS JUST PREPARING FOR THE PANDEMIC THAT. I THINK YOU KNOW THAT NEVER THAT NEVER CAME OF COURSE WE HAD EACH ONE AND ONE- AND SO. WHAT AND SO YOU KNOW I SPENT MANY YEARS THINKING ABOUT THINKING ABOUT HOW WE WOULD RESPOND TO PANDEMIC AND IN FACT WE'VE PULLED OUT ALL THOSE ARTICLES IN THE CDC GUIDELINES. AND THE FLAG ME TH CURVE AND SOCIAL DISTANCING ALL THOSE THE TOOL KIT WITH. WAS DEVELOPED BUT HAVE NEVER REALLY BEEN. IN A REAL CONCRETE WAY A LITTLE BIT OF IT WAS IMPLEMENTED WITH SARS WANTED EARLY EARLY TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND AND THREE- AND SO. I WOULD SAY THAT WE JUST LEARNED. ALL THE OPERATIONAL DETAILS OF WHAT IT TAKES TO ACTUALLY. ON TO COMBAT THE PANDEMIC OF THIS SEVERITY. WE JUST LEARNED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT IN TERMS OF THAT TESTING- THE IMPORTANCE TO DO REALLY GOOD SERVICE GOOD SURVEILLANCE EARLY DETECTION. REALLY TRYING TO DETERMINE WHAT THE DRIVERS OF THE INFECTION ARE YOU CAN YOU CAN SEE THAT FROM. THE BEGINNING FROM THE BEGINNING HOW HOW LITTLE WE KNEW ABOUT THE VIRUS WE ASSUME THAT IT JUST SPREAD TO LARGE DROPLETS WHEN IT WAS REALLY SPREAD THROUGHOUT OUR SOULS AND WAS AIRBORNE AND CAN TRAVEL DISTANCES. WITH YOUNGER PEOPLE WOULD ONLY HAVE SYMPTOMS WITH ARMED FACTIONS WHEN WE COME TO LEARN THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE ARE A SIMPLE A SYMPTOMATIC- IN SO ALL OF THESE THINGS WORK- IT WORKED. REALLY HOMEBUILDING HUMBLED EVERYBODY AYE AYE I TELL PEOPLE ALL OF US WERE WRONG AT SOME POINT ABOUT COVERAGE. AND SO DID DID FOR US TO BE ABLE TO REALLY. RESPOND LEARN. PIVOT AND ADAPT. AND EVENTUALLY BE SUCCESSFUL I DON'T THINK THEY'RE REALLY CONCERNED ME WHEN THIS STARTED. YOU KNOW I STARTED GOING BACK AND JUST LOOKING YOU KNOW THE NINETEEN EIGHTEEN PANDEMIC IN YOU'RE LOOKING. YEAR AFTER YEAR WAVE AFTER WAVE AFTER WAVE AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE. A VACCINE AS SOON AS WE DID. IT IS HISTORIC AND SO WE'RE INCREDIBLY FORTUNATE TO HAVE A VACCINE. BOB RENO RIGHT NOW IT'S A IT'S BEEN EIGHTEEN MONTHS. AND IF WE DO NOT HAVE THE VACCINE THIS WEEK. WE WOULD NOT JUNE FIFTEENTH WHEN OUT OF HER COURAGE. WE WOULD BE HAVING ANOTHER CERTAIN WE WOULD BE HAVING A SERVICE TO THE VACCINE HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. YEAH I THINK THAT'S BEEN REALLY USEFUL TO US IS LEARNING HOW TO WORK MORE CLOSELY WITH THE LOCALS. AND REALLY FIGURING OUT THAT THE RIGHT BALANCE SO AT THE STATE LEVEL WE HAVE MATHEMATICAL MODELLERS DEVER DOING PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS AND HELPING US PROTECT THE NUMBER OF CASES THE HOSPITALIZATION. YOUR CAPACITY AND WE WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS WEEK BEFORE. WE BEFORE THAT WHAT WE PROJECTED WAS GOING TO HAPPEN SO FOR EXAMPLE WE LIFTED. WHEN WE LIVED IN A REGIONAL STAND HOME ORDER AND- WE A LOT OF STARTED OPENING UP THE ECONOMY WE ACTUALLY DID THAT THROUGH PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS WE WERE ABLE TO OPEN UP TO. FOR WEEKS EARLIER INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR THINGS TO GO DOWN WE WERE ABLE TO PROJECTED AND FEEL CONFIDENT IN OUR OBJECTIONS TO BE ABLE TO. TO BE ABLE TO MAKE BIG POLICY DECISIONS LIKE THAT. AND SO- THAT'S THAT'S TREMENDOUS- YOU KNOW I CAN TELL YOU THAT DID NOT EXIST TEN YEARS AGO SO- AND I HOPE TO REALLY BUILD ON THAT ON THAT EXCELLENCE. LOW ARM. HE NIGHT SIR. THIS MORNING WHEN ASK YOU ANYTHING I TO ABOUT IT IN THE ZOO BUT THAT RAISES A- THAT I. HAD I DIDN'T YOU WHAT WHEN WE GET THROUGH THIS IN SOME FASHION. WILL THERE BE SOME FORMAL PROCESS WITHIN YOUR DEPARTMENT OF A POST MORTEM AND LOOK BACK AND SAY THIS IS WHAT WE COULD HAVE DONE BETTER THIS IS WHERE WE MIGHT HAVE MADE A DECISION DIFFERENTLY. OR INCLUDE THE THINGS YOU JUST SAID WHICH SOME OF THE INCREDIBLE THINGS THAT WORKED WELL WILL THERE BE SOME KIND OF PROCESS LIKE THAT- YES. THERE THERE ALWAYS IS RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING A SMALLER- INTO FROM I WAS CALLED THAT AFTER ACTION REPORT. AND WE'RE WE'RE EVEN AYE YOU WOULD WORRY VALUE WAITING HOW WE MANAGE THE INCIDENT EARLY ON. BUT WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT LOOK AT EVERYTHING THERE IS THERE IS A H. A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT TO LEARN- AND IT WASN'T IT WASN'T JUST THE FINANCE NOT JUST A PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS. NOT JUST WORKING WITH LOCALS. BUT PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS ARE ALWAYS VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE- WE WANT TO DO THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE ACTIVITY THAT GETS THE GETS THE JOB DONE. AND UNFORTUNATELY SOME IN THE MATTER. WHENEVER YOU DO PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTION- YOU'RE SOMEONE'S ALWAYS GOING TO GET UPSET AND SO. IT'S VERY VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE IT'S VERY CHALLENGING BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE HARM NOT JUST BY THE VIRUS BUT THE SHUTDOWN. HAD HAD HAD A REAL IMPACT. ON THE ECONOMY AND PEOPLE AND SO- ALWAYS HAVE TO BE VERY SENSITIVE AND BE COMPASSIONATE AND UNDERSTAND. THAT OUR PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS- CAN BE DIFFICULT CAN BE DIFFICULT ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE IF IT WAS THE RIGHT THING. RIGHT THING TO DO. AND THE ONE LAST QUESTION I KNOW THAT. WHEN WE TALKED EARLIER TODAY I MENTIONED THAT I HAD RUN AND AIDS SERVICE AGENCY AT THE HEIGHT OF THE EPIDEMIC. AND WHEN I WAS RUNNING FOR THE ASSEMBLY THE FIRST TIME I KEPT MAKING THE STATEMENT IN PUBLIC THAT I WANT TO GET ELECTED BECAUSE I WANTED TO DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF FAITH STAFF TO SIT. IN MY OFFICE. AND BE POLITE TO ME. HEY IN. A REPORT WAS TO. WANTED FINAL HAPPENED IT TURNED TO BE FOR. BUT NOW YOUR IN THAT POSITION. IF YOU WERE A PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER. FOR TEN YEARS SAID AND IN THE DEPARTMENT BEFORE THAT. NOW YOU ARE THIS THE STATE AND WE WERE VOTED TO CONFIRM YOU AS THE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER. WHAT DID YOU WISH THE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER WOULD HAVE DONE OR OR YOU WERE VERY WORRIED THAT THEY WEREN'T CONCERNED ABOUT ENOUGH WHEN YOU WERE OF LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER TRYING TO INTERACT WITH THE STATE. ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT IN GENERAL OR SPECIFIC EVENT BACKYARD GO EITHER WAY IF YOU COULD COME UP WITH SOMETHING. YOU KNOW I THINK FOR ME I FEEL IT- I HAD MENTIONED THIS TO YOU EARLIER IN GENERAL THE PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNITY IS VERY COLLABORATIVE. WE'RE NOT COMPETITIVE- WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO SUPPORT EACH OTHER YOU KNOW DISEASES. INFECTIOUS DISEASES ARE EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS THEY DON'T FOLLOW POLITICAL BOUNDARIES REGION'S GET AFFECTED YOU YOU HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER YOU DON'T CARE WHERE THE WE DON'T CARE WHERE THE BEST IDEAS COME FROM- AND SO THAT AND THE CITIZENS. YOU KNOW THE RESIDENTS OF THE STATE EXPECT THAT THEY THEY DON'T THEY DON'T WANT TO GO FROM ONE TIMES NEXT THE NEXT COUNTY YOU KNOW YOU DON'T CROSS COUNTY LINE AND ALL THE SUDDEN THINGS ARE VERY DIFFERENT. AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WERE ABLE TO COLLABORATE- AND ALIGN AND COORDINATE AROUND PREVENTION ACTIVITIES WERE GOING TO BE MUCH MORE IMPACTFUL. AND SO IN THE- WHAT. GIVEN THAT CONTEXT MY EXPERIENCE WITH THIS WITH THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT OVER THE OVER THE YEARS. HAS ALWAYS BEEN INCREDIBLY POSITIVE- WITH WITH THE STATE WITH THE STATE HEALTH OFFICER THE STATE EPIDEMIOLOGIST ALL THE COMMUNICABLE DISEASE FOX- I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH A LOT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL THE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH. INVESTIGATIONS BRANCH OUR RADIATION HEALTH FRENCH YOU KNOW WITH THE NAVAL SHIPYARD IN SAN FRANCISCO- JUST TREMENDOUS TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF SUPPORT AND THE OTHER THING I MENTIONED EARLIER IS THAT. OF THIS THE STATE. ALWAYS TREATS THE LOG NOT THIS IS BEEN MY EXPERIENCE I'M NOT SPEAKING OUT FROM MY EXPERIENCE WHEN I WAS LOCAL. IS THAT THE STRAIGHT THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT ALWAYS TREATED US WITH THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RESPECT AS IF WE WERE THEIR CUSTOMER. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE NOTICED YOUR SINCE I'VE GOTTEN HERE TO THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENTIS THAT. THEY'RE THEY'RE VERY ATTENTIVE TO THE NEEDS- OF COURSE WE COULD ALWAYS DO MORE WE CAN NEVER THERE'S ALWAYS MORE THAN W CAN DO BUT I REALLY LIKE THAT I LIKE THAT. THE CUSTOMER CENTRIC I THINK IT'S OF SERVICE TO THE LOCALS. WELL THAT ISN'T THE CASE WITH EVERY STATE DEPARTMENT SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT EXPERIENCE IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR. BEING VERY RESPONSIVE TO THE YOU'RE WELCOME. SENATOR THANK YOU VERY THOUGHTFUL QUESTIONS- SENATOR GROWTH. THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM M. I APOLOGIZE I IF I ASK YOU DUPLICATE OF QUESTIONS BECAUSE I BOUNCE BACK BETWEEN- HEALTH AND RULES AT THE SAME TIME AS SO PLEASE FORGIVE ME FOR THAT AND I DO APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO MEET WITH YOU- PRIOR TO THIS. OPEN HEARING. I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS REGARDING VALLEY FEVER IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN A CALIFORNIA HAD THE HIGHEST NUMBERS OF VALLEY FEVER IN THE HIGHEST INCIDENCES ARE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY- DURING NINETEEN AND TWENTY CDPH IMPLEMENTED A MULTIMEDIA VALLEY FEVER AWARENESS CAMPAIGN. AND CAN YOU GIVE ME YOUR- ANY INFORMATION OR SHARE WITH ME THE LESSONS THAT WERE LEARNED FROM THAT AWARENESS CAMPAIGN REGARDING VALLEY FEVER. I YEAH SO THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR BRINGING UP ON VALLEY FEVER I'M- I UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE NOT HAD A CHANCE TO REVIEW REVIEW THAT'S ALL I DON'T HAVE A- IN THE ANSWER FOR YOU AT THE MOMENT. OKAY I DIDN'T MEAN TO ASK A QUESTION THAT WE HADN'T TALKED ABOUT AGAIN I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO MEET. IT'S OKAY IT'S OKAY IT'S A IT'S AN APARTMENT IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FONG FUNGAL INFECTION. AND IT'S ANTICIPATED THAT IN GENERAL I'M JUST STOP SPEAKING TO YOU FROM JUST MY KNOWLEDGE OF- THAT FUNGAL INFECTIONS- BECAUSE BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND INCREASING HEAT AND DROUGHT. UNFORTUNATELY I ANTICIPATE. THAT IT'S GOING TO BE A BIGGER ISSUE FOR THE SAME. OKAY THANK YOU SIR VERY MUCH. AGAIN IF YOU'VE BEEN ASKED THESE QUESTIONS- I DO APOLOGIZE I KNOW THIS LIMPLY EXPLANATION THAT I'M GONNA GIVE IT FIRST BEFORE I GET DOWN TO THE QUESTION- WILL BE LONG. AND THEM IF YOU NEED ME TO STOP AND WE CAN YOU KNOW DIALOGUE BETWEEN- THIS SAID BE GREAT. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE FDA APPROVAL FOR VACCINES IN THE U. EASY WAY. AUTHORIZATION THAT WE'RE OPERATING UNDER NOW FOR BECAUSE THE VACCINE THEIR COPA NINETEEN- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT. IS- PHYSICALLY- THE UNDER- TWENTY ONE USC. CODE THIRTY THREE SIXTY B. B. B. THREE E. WHICH I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE OF BECAUSE IT DEALS WITH- TO SEE- E. WAYS SPECIFICALLY. AN INDIVIDUAL MUST BE INFORMED OF THE OPTION TO ACCEPT OR REFUSE ADMINISTRATION OF THE PRODUCT OF THE CAR AND THE CONSEQUENCES IF ANY. FOR REFUSING ADMINISTRATION OF A PRODUCT. AND OF THE ALTERNATIVES TO THE PRODUCT IF THEY'RE AVAILABLE. AND ITS BENEFITS OR RISK ALTHOUGH NO COURT THAT I KNOW OF HAS- INTERPRETED THIS PROVISION. BECAUSE THIS PROVISION HAS NOT BEEN A LONG THERE'S NOT BEEN CASE LAW ESTABLISH AN ESTABLISHED. RIGHT AFTER NINE ELEVEN. I MEAN THERE HASN'T BEEN A- A CASE LAW THAT I'M AWARE OF IF YOU ARE I'D LIKE TO HEAR YOUR- INTERPRETATION OF THAT- OF THE AND THAT. YOU KNOW THE CASE LAW BUT- THAT SPECIFICALLY FOR EMPLOYEES IT SAYS THAT. THEY HAVE TO BE- UNDER THE- E. WAY THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE OPTION TO ACCEPT OR REFUSE THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE PRODUCT IN THE CONSEQUENCES. OF REFUSING THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE PRODUCT. AND ALTERNATIVES FOR THE PRODUCT IF THEY'RE AVAILABLE AND ANY BENEFITS OR RISK. LIKE I SAID I DON'T THINK A COURT HAS RULED ON THIS BUT- IT'S MY AND AGAIN I'M NOT A LAWYER BARELY GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL WENT TO A CONTINUATION HIGH SCHOOL SO YOU KNOW IT'S PRETTY ROTTEN KID- BUT BASED ON MY INTERPRETATION THE FIRST SEGMENT. OF THE SUB CLASS SUGGESTS THAT- MANDATES ARE CATEGORICALLY PROHIBITED- SINCE EACH PERSON MUST HAVE THE OPTION TO ACCEPT OR REFUSE. OF WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT- SO YOU'RE BRINGING UP A REALLY GOOD QUESTION- SO IN GENERAL WITH VACCINE WITH VACCINES- WE BASICALLY HAVE THREE KEY STRATEGIES- THE FIRST DREADED USED TO RECOMMEND THE VACCINE ANOTHER ANOTHER STRATEGIES TO HAVE A VACCINE MANDATED IN ANOTHER STRATEGY IS TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE TO BECOME VACCINATED- THANK YOU MICHAEL MANDATE IS NOT SOMETHING THAT A PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT OR HEALTH OFFICER. WOULD IN GENERAL WHICH WOULD DO IT'S SOMETHING THAT REALLY WOULD IN MY MIND- WE REALLY HAVE TO GO THROUGH LEGISLATIVE PROCESS- AND I WOULD NOT EXPECT THAT TO EVEN BE AN ISSUE UNTIL IT BECAME NOT FULLY STA APPROVED- SOME TELL YOU I'M GIVING YOU MY PERSPECTIVE AS A FROM FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH. AND HEALTH OFFICER PERSPECTIVE- IN GENERAL WE WOULD NOT WE WOULD NOT RESORT TO- MANDATING A VACCINE. OKAY SO- TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT ON THE KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION IT ACTUALLY SUPPORTS THE PUBLIC HEALTH OR EXCUSE ME HEALTH FAIRS ANALYSIS- OF THE LANGUAGE THAT'S IN THAT CODE SECTION BECAUSE WORRY IT YOU KNOW WE'RE DEALING WITH THE EASY WAY VERSUS A ACTUALLY FDA APPROVED VACCINE WHEN IT COMES THE COVERT VACCINE. AND- I GUESS THE PROBLEM I HAVE IS THAT THERE IS A GREAT NUMBER OF EMPLOYERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ARE REQUIRING EMPLOYEES TO BE VACCINATED IN ORDER- WELL THEY DON'T REALLY SAY IT SO THEY'RE VIOLATING THE FIRST RULE BECAUSE THEY DON'T PROVIDE THE EMPLOYEE WITH OPTIONS OR THE CONSEQUENCES OF REFUSING THE PRODUCT BUT UNDER THE EMERGENCY YOU THOUGHT THE AUTHORIZATION THE MANDATE- CAN'T REALLY BE MANDATED BECAUSE- IT'S NOT A FULLY FDA APPROVED. VACCINES SO IS IT YOUR OPINION THAT- BASED ON JUST WHAT YOU JUST SAID. I MEAN IS IT RIGHT OR WHAT'S YOUR OPINION IF EMPLOYERS SAY YOU KNOW YOU CAN NO LONGER BE EMPLOYED HERE UNLESS YOU GET THIS CODE THAT. YOU'RE ASKING A VERY A VERY GOOD QUESTION AND I HAVE NOT SPECIFICALLY- I DO WE DO WAY THAT WE'VE BEEN FOCUSING ON VACCINES IS- AND- IS TO ENCOURAGE INCENTIVIZE. AS MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO GET VACCINATED AS A WAY TO FIGHT THE PANDEMIC AND THAT'S BEEN OUR PRODUCT AND THAT'S BEEN OUR PRIMARY. APPROACH WE RECOGNIZE SOMETHING AS SERIOUS AS MANDATING MANDATING WE HAVE TO BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE THROUGH A LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IF IT WAS GOING TO COME FROM GOVERNMENT. IN TERMS OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR- I I'M I'M NOT I'M NOT A LAWYER. I KNOW I KNOW THE LAWYERS HAVE OPINED ON THAT SPECIFIC ISSUE- AND SO I'M NOT REALLY I DON'T FEEL QUALIFIED TO STAY SAFE TO SAY MORE- I KNOW THAT IT IS. MY UNDERSTANDING THAT FROM THAT IT IS LEGAL FOR EMPLOYERS TO DO THAT AND I SUSPECT BILLS THAT DO CHOOSE TO DO THAT WILL WAIT UNTIL IT'S FULLY FTA APPROVED. BUT THAT'S REALLY ALL I'M PREPARED TO STAND AT THE MOMENT OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT COMMENT BECAUSE I DO I'M THERE YOU KNOW I ANTICIPATE THIS WILL ALWAYS SABRINA COURT AT. ONE POINT OR THE OTHER I MEAN THAT'S JUST MY- AND EDUCATED THOUGHT PROCESS. BE I AGREE WITH STATEMENT I DON'T THINK GOVERNMENT CAN IMPOSE A VACCINE- ESPECIALLY UNDER- THE ERC YOUTH AUTHORIZATION CODE THAT SPECIFICALLY SAYS THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE IT BECAUSE IT'S NOT FDA APPROVED. SO I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS ON THAT- VERY MUCH- SO THE NEXT QUESTION THAT I HAVE A GET OFF OF THAT SCENES NOW BECAUSE I THINK MY COLLEAGUES. AND FROM ORANGE COUNTY COVERED. SOME OTHER ISSUES ON VACCINES. I HAVE SOME OTHER QUESTIONS AND- HAVE YOU KNOW HAVE- I THINK ALL OF US NOT JUST REPUBLICANS THE DEMOCRATS AS WELL HAVE BEEN- VERY CONCERNED AND ARE LOOKING OUT LEGISLATIVE SOLUTIONS ON MENTAL HEALTH- IN THE MENTAL HEALTH EFFECTS OF THEPANDEMIC ISOLATION DEPRESSION ALCOHOLISM. THERE'S BEEN JUST A LOT OF STUFF THAT HAS HAPPENED OF BEING PENT UP FOR OVER A YEAR. SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS- YOU KNOW GIVEN THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS THAT OUR SCHOOLS WILL ULTIMATELY FACE AND I'M AGAIN NOT A DOCTOR OR A LAWYER BUT I JUST. LISTENING TO PARENTS CALL MY OFFICE THEY'RE DEALING WITH THINGS THAT THEY HAVE NEVER HAD TO DEAL WITH BEFORE HAVING THEIR CHILDREN- ISOLATED FOR A YEAR AWAY FROM THEIR FRIENDS AND OUTSIDE OF IN PERSON LEARNING- WHAT'S THE ROLE THAT YOU CDPH- HAS TO COORDINATE EFFORTS WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS TO ADDRESS. AND SPECIFICALLY YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES- IN THE STATE. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS TOPIC UP ITS FIRST FOR ME THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TOPIC IN. AND WE STARTED RECOGNIZING THIS YOU KNOW EARLY ON IN IN THE IN THE PANDEMIC- YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS HEALTH OFFICER IN SAN FRANCISCO AND- WHATEVER WHATEVER. EARLY AS GOALS WAS TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO GET KIDS BACK IN SCHOOL. WE WENT OUT AND DID SITE VISITS WE DID EVERYTHING WE CAN TO GET THE SCHOOLS GET THE SCHOOLS TO. OPEN UP THOSE SCHOOLS WHERE THEY WERE THEY WERE READY TO OPEN UP AND IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. THE OTHER ISSUE THAT HAPPENS THIS IS JUST THE STRESS THE LOSS OF THE LOSS OF EMPLOYMENT IF YOU LIVE IF YOU LIVE IN POVERTY OR YOU LOST A JOB. THAT STRESS HAS AN IMPACT ALSO ON THE NEURAL DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN COOL PEOPLE CALLED ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES ARE TOXIC STRESS. SO WE KNOW THAT THOSE FAMILIES HAVE BEEN IMPACTED THOSE KIDS HAVE BEEN IMPACTED THAT'S NOT JUST LEARNING LOSS IS ALSO THE IMPACT ON THE RURAL DEVELOPMENT. IN THAT'S GONNA SHOW UP LATER IN TERMS OF CHRONIC DISEASES BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS ISSUES WITH EXECUTIVE FUNCTION AND- I REGULATING REGULATING EMOTIONS. AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. ISSUE SO FORTUNATELY IN THE GOVERNOR- IN THE IN THE CURRENT BUDGET. DOES HAVE A CROSS AGENCY OUR CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIOR HEALTH INITIATIVE. THAT'S GOING TO FOCUS ON IN SEVERAL MAJOR KERRY I'LL JUST MENTION THREE OF THE MAJOR AREAS ONE AREA IS GOING TO BE. ON DIAGNOSE SCENE EARLY ON WITH PEDIATRICIANS WERE TRAINED FOR TRAINED. TO SCREEN FOR KIDS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED ANY TYPE OF STRESS SO THEY CAN START DEALING WITH THOSE KIDS EARLY ON LIFE. WORKING WITH SCHOOLS AROUND- MENTAL HEALTH- TRAINING AND TEACHING THEM ABOUT TRAUMA AND HOW IT IMPACTS CHILDREN SO THAT WE CAN GET THOSE CHILDREN INTO MENTAL HEALTH CARE. BUILDING BUILDING A STATEWIDE BEHAVIOR HEALTH SYSTEM THAT'S GOING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TELEHEALTH. ANYONE IN THE STATE HAS ACCESS. TO BE ABLE TO GET MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT IF THEY NEED TO. AND THEN THAT THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT PA. IS GOING TO BE SPENT. FOR ON THE CAMP. REYES AWARENESS ABOUT HOW. HOW TO RECOGNIZE IT HOW TO ACCESS SERVICES. AND YOUR PER YOU'RE BRINGING UP- AND INCREDIBLY INCREDIBLY. IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE. AND THEN I THINK ALL OF US REALLY HAVE TO COME TOGETHER AND REALLY ADDRESS BECAUSE- IF WE DON'T ADDRESS IT- I THINK WE WILL SEE MORE PROBLEMS DOWN THE LINE. THANK THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. I A I AGREE THAT IF WE DON'T ADDRESS THAT WE WILL SEE MORE PROBLEMS ONLINE AND THANK YOU- I DID NOT KNOW THAT YOU WENT OUT TO VISIT- SCHOOLS AND- REALLY ADVOCATED FOR THEIR OPENING I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH ESPECIALLY KEVIN- FROM SOMEBODY OF YOUR STATURE. IN YOUR POSITION IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE- DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE OUR STUDENTS AND OUR YOUNGER. GENERATION GET THROUGH THIS CODE SITUATION AND YOU BROUGHT UP SOMETHING THAT I DIDN'T EVEN. ADDRESS IN MY COMMENTS ABOUT YOU KNOW A PARENT BEING UNEMPLOYED OR LOSING THEIR JOB OR THEIR JOB ACTUALLY BEING DEEMED NONESSENTIAL. THEY WEREN'T ALLOWED TO GO TO WORK EVEN THOUGH THEY COULD HAVE GONE TO WORK BUT THEY WERE ALLOWED TO GO TO WORK. AND THAT HAS GOT TO CREATE- STRESS IN A HOME ENVIRONMENT. AND YOU KNOW WHAT I LEARNED DURING THIS PANDEMIC IS THEM. SOMETHING THAT REALLY FRIGHTENED TO ME IS THAT YOU KNOW SOME PLACES SOMETIMES AND- SCHOOL IS THE SAFEST PLACE FOR OUR CHILDREN TO BE. AND THAT IS A REALLY SAD FACT THAT WE LEARNED DURING THIS PANDEMIC- I JUST WANT TO GO BACK TO A PREVIOUS- QUESTIONS ON THE VACCINE AND ONE OF STATE. FOR THE RECORD IN CASE ANYBODY'S LISTENING THAT. WOULD TO ATTACK IN LATER. BASS ON MY QUESTION. AND I AM NOT AN ANTI VAXXERS. MISTER THE UNITED STATES MILITARY BEEN DEPLOYED OVERSEAS. I'VE BEEN GIVEN EVERY VACCINE PROBABLY KNOWN TO MAN. AND THAT HAVE SO I IT IS NOT AND IT IS NOT ANTI VAX QUESTION IT'S A PERSONAL FREEDOM QUESTION. AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT GOVERNMENT OR ANY EMPLOYER SHOULD MANDATE A VACCINE EMPLOYEES OR TELL THEM THEY CANNOT BE EMPLOYED THERE. ANYMORE SO- I JUST WANNA CLARIFY THAT IN SIR I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO TAKE ON THIS A- POSITION AS MY- COLLEAGUE FOR THE BAY AREA. ALLUDED TO EARLIER. YOU WERE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND THEN RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DISASTERS PANDEMIC YOU STEPPED UP INTO A STATE WIDE LEVEL AND I APPRECIATE- YOUR WILLINGNESS TO TAKE ON THAT TASK. THANK YOU SIR. YOU'RE WELCOME. THANK YOU I DR- I APPRECIATE SO MUCH YOUR BEING HERE TODAY AND I WANT TO START WITH MY THANKS ARE. I'M QUITE AWARE THAT AS AS WE AS AN EMPLOYER AS THE SENATE AS AN EMPLOYER- YOU TOOK THE TIME TO MEET WITH OUR SECRETARY TO MAKE SURE THAT QUESTIONS WERE ANSWERED SO THAT WE WERE DOING THE BEST JOB WE COULD AS AN EMPLOYER- SO ON BEHALF OF. HER AND CERTAINLY- HER COUNTERPART IN THE ASSEMBLY I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO MEET DIRECTLY WITH THEM TO HELP US- WELCOME. THE ARM. MY COLLEAGUE FROM BAKERSFIELD BROUGHT UP AN ISSUE THAT YOU SAID- IT REALLY HAVE INFORMATION ON THAT RIGHT NOW BUT YOU AT THE VALLEY FEVER ISSUE. I'VE TALKED TO SEVERAL OF MY COLLEAGUES CURRENT AND- PAST OF WHO OF SERVE FROM FROM THE AREA WHO BROUGHT THIS UP AS AN ISSUE- I GUESS I WOULD ASK THE COMMENT THAT YOU MADE IT'S A BIGGER ISSUE- AT WHAT WE SHOULD DO I WOULD ASK TO JUST BE KEPT APPRISED OF THIS BECAUSE- YOU KNOW IT. THIS BECAME A REQUEST A IF IT BECAME A DIFFERENT BUDGET REQUESTS FROM A FORMER COLLEAGUE- FROM TRACY AT ONE POINT FROM- YOUR PREDECESSOR US SENATOR GROW FROM BAKERSFIELD. AND AND I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY WHEN I WAS IN THE VALLEY TO MEET WITH SOME. OF LOCAL FOLKS AND IT WAS AMAZING TO ME THE NUMBER OF FOLKS THAT BROUGHT THIS UP TO ME PERSONALLY SO WHEN THERE IS INFORMATION TO SHARE OR IF WE NEED TO BE PROACTIVE. OUR AND BE DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT I WOULD HOPE THAT WE COULD BE MADE AWARE OF THAT BECAUSE IT IS CONTINUE TO BE AN ISSUE SO I'LL JUST. LEAVE THAT THERE- BECAUSE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT ISSUES OF. PAIRED FOR THIS PANDEMIC OR- AND I APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUE FROM LA'S COMMENTS ABOUT THE INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND PARTICULARLY HEPATITIS A AND THOSE ISSUES THAT WE HAD TO DEAL WITH OUR COMMUNITIES WE SHOULD'VE BEEN BETTER PREPARED FOR THAT AND MAYBE THAT WAS OUR LOCAL REACTION OR RESPONSE OR WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE DONE THE PIVOT. TO ADDRESS- AND I APPRECIATE THE STATE STEP IN AND HELP US WIN WHEN WE NEEDED THAT BUT AS IT RELATES TO VALLEY FEVER THE QUESTION I WOULD SAY IS. AT WHAT POINT DO WE NEED TO. YOU KNOW I'M NOT A DOCTOR EITHER- MS GROW AS YOU KNOW. BUT I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING MORE AND I COUNT ON YOU AS THE EXPERT TO HELP US FIGURE OUT. IF WE ARE NOT FOCUSED ENOUGH ON THAT ON THAT ISSUE IN THAT REGARD. TELL US WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING TO BE HELPFUL TO YOU. FROM AND OTHER THAN THAT MY COLLEAGUES ASK MOST OF THE QUESTIONS. THE ONLY. OUTSTANDING QUESTION I WOULD ASK AS IT RELATES TO. OBVIOUSLY THE PANDEMIC WERE IN BUT- THE ISSUE OF DATA THAT HAS COME UP OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO IS TALKED ABOUT. DATA AS IT RELATES TO THE L. G. B. T. Q. COMMUNITY AND AS THIS PANDEMIC GOT UNDER WAY. YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW IF WE WERE. YOU WE HAD TO PAY THAT WE HAD TO DO A LOT AT ONE TIME AND THAT'S ALWAYS IN THE MIDDLE OF A CRISIS. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THE DATA WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COLLECTED MORE WE QUICK TO- TO RESPOND IN IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE WERE AWARE OF SO WE GET THE DATA AND WE SEE. THE NUMBERS RELATED TO THE LATINO THE- A. P. I. X. AFTER EXCEPT FOR ALL OF THE COMMUNITIES AND- HOW IT IMPACTS DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES- THE DESPERATE I KIND OF. RESPONSES AND REACTIONS- I'M JUST LIKE YOU TO COMMENT GENERALLY ON DATA COLLECTION. AND ARE WE ABLE TO BACK UP AND GET ANY INFORMATION THAT WE WEREN'T GETTING THAT ALSO INCLUDES THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY BECAUSE- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE LEFT OUT OF THE DATA COLLECTION. IT'S PROBLEMATIC AS WE'VE SEEN HISTORICALLY WOMEN WERE LEFT OUT OF DATA COLLECTION AND STUDIES AND THINGS THAT COULD HELP US BE. BETTER TREATED. AND THAT'S TRUE FOR SO MANY COMMUNITIES AND WE THOUGHT WE WOULD BE FURTHER AHEAD ON. ON THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY IN COLLECTING DATA THERE AND IT TURNS OUT WE WEREN'T I DON'T THINK. SO WE YOU JST COMMENT ON ON THE DATA PIECE AND WHETHER WE CAN BACK UP AND- CORRECT. YES THANK YOU SO MUCH IT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT QUESTION SO. IN TWENTY ELEVEN WHEN I BECAME TO HELP OFFICERS SAN FRANCISCO ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE DID WAS. WE BROUGHT TOGETHER A TEAM- INCLUDING STAKEHOLDERS AND WE DEVELOPED BY ACTUALLY ONE OF THE FIRST. GUIDELINES PROBABLY IN THE COUNTRY I KNOW CERTAINLY THE STATE AT THAT TIME. GUIDELINES ON COLLECTING INFORMATION ABOUT RACE ETHNICITY SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY AND SOMETHING WE GIVE ALL THREE SEPARATE GUIDELINES THAT REALLY BECAME THE BASIS. OF WHAT OTHER FOLKS CAN'T IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. AND AND IT IT- IT REQUIRED FOR US TO DO IT CORRECTLY REALLY REQUIRED US BY WORKING WITH THE DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GOT IT RIGHT. WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY HOW TO ASK THE QUESTIONS. AND THE NFL TIME IT WAS REALLY PRIMARILY DIRECTED AROUND HEALTHCARE SERVICES HEALTHCARE SERVICES. IS SO LITTLE DIFFERENCE I MEAN BECAUSE YOU HAVE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS YOUR PROVIDER. AS THE SYSTEM. IS A LITTLE BIT EASIER SET SET UP. WITH COMMUNICABLE DISEASES COMMUTABLE DISEASES AS WELL BUT- SO WE HAVE A SERVER. SYSTEM WHERE HEALTH SYSTEMS FOR LABORATORIES. PROVIDE US THE DATA. AND OFTENTIMES THE DATA THAT COMES IS VERY LIMITED SELF A LOT OF THE LAB SLIP IS POSITIVE OFTENTIMES IT DOESN'T HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION THAT WE WOULD WANT ON THAT SPECIFIC CASE. AS TO WHETHER CHALLENGES WE HAD WITH FACT BECAUSE IT IS THAT IF THE INFORMATION WASN'T COLLECTED BY THE PROVIDER OR WASN'T- USUALLY THE LABS ARE NOT GOING TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. AND THEN WE SAID WITH THEIR SIGHTS SET UP ALL ACROSS THE STATE TO TEST AS MANY PEOPLE I NEED A TESTING. SO IS SPECIALLY EARLY ON AND WE DID WE DID NOT EVEN HAVE A GOOD RACE ETHNICITY DATA IT WAS VERY BAD. AND IT TOOK IT TOOK A WHILE TO GET THE IMPROVE THOSE SYSTEMS UP. THE GENDER IDENTITY DATA DID EVENTUALLY IMPROVED A ONE OF THE BIG GAP AREAS CONTINUES TO BE SEXUAL ORIENTATION. AND THAT ALSO CONTINUE TO BE TRUE ALSO FOR VACCINATIONS THE FOR VACCINATIONS YOU CAN GET INFORMATION ON GENDER IDENTITY. BOB I'M NOT SEXUAL ORIENTATION SO THESE ARE CAP AREAS THAT WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO FIX. BOB AND I AND I AGREE I AGREE WITH YOU- IF WE DON'T IF WE DON'T MEASURE THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE. I ISSUES AND IT'S A VERY IT'S AN INEQUITY THAT. WE NEED TO WE NEED TO ELIMINATE. WELL THANK YOU DOC HOPEFUL YOU CAN. WORK WITH US IN HELP A- ON THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT WE DON'T TRY TO MAKE. LIFE DIFFICULT ALTHOUGH SOME MIGHT DISAGREE. WAIT WHILE WE DON'T NECESSARILY TRY WE JUST PUT IT THROUGH OUR LANDS OF WHAT'S IMPORTANT IN MAKING SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND OUR CONCERN- SO.

ADDRESSING THE COST OF WATER SERVICE DURING EXTREME DROUGHT CONDITIONS. THESE DECISIONS WILL REQUIRE BALANCING MANY BEATING INTEREST. I HAVE SPENT OVER TWO DECADES WORKING IN THE ENERGY NATURAL RESOURCES AND WATER SECTOR REPRESENTING STATE AGENCIES TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. I'VE SERVED AS AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE AT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND AS CHIEF COUNSEL FOR THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. THESE EXPERIENCES COMBINED WITH MY COMMITMENT TO INCLUSION AND EQUITY I BELIEVE WILL SERVE CALIFORNIA WELL I HOPE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE PUC'S EFFORTS AND PROVIDING COMMUNITIES BETTER ACCESS TO OUR PROCESSES AND EXPANDING AFFECTED COLLABORATION WITH OUR SISTER AGENCIES. I UNDERSTAND THAT MANY OF THE DECISIONS THAT YOU SEE WILL NEED TO MAKE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS WILL HAVE IMPACTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. IT IS THEREFORE IMPORTANT TO ENSURE INCLUSIVE TRANSPARENT PROCESSES THAT ALLOW FOR MEANINGFUL PARTICIPATION BY DIVERSE STAKEHOLDERS AND ENSURE THAT INFORMED DECISIONS ARE MADE IN. AN EQUITABLE MANNER. IN MY ROLE AS A COMMISSIONER I COMMIT TO WORK TOWARDS ENSURING INCLUSION FOR CALIFORNIA. PARTICULARLY TRIBAL RULE AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WHO ARE ALL TOO OFTEN OUT OF OUR PROCESSES. I ALSO COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH MY FELLOW COMMISSIONERS AND SISTER AGENCIES TO ABOUT TO DEVELOP POSITIVE INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS EXPAND BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE AND WORK TO ENSURE ARE REGULATED ENTITIES PROVIDE RELIABLE STATE PORTABLE. SERVICES TO ALL OF CALIFORNIA SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF MY APPOINTMENTS AND I'M AVAILABLE FOR ASK YOUR QUESTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND CENTER LAYERED I AM GOING TO START WITH THIS TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR IN. OUR I APPRECIATED THE CHANCE TO MEET TOGETHER AND JUST SHOULD SAY. FOR SOME REASON AND THIS MAY BE TRUE WITH EVERY MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE I JUST HAVE SO MANY DISTRICT ISSUES THAT INTERACT WITH YOU AND- THE DECOMMISSIONING OF DOWNLOAD DIABLO CANYON THE- OF THE FOURTEEN THOUSAND ACRES P. JEANNIE HAS THAT WE WOULD LIKE FOR PERMANENT LAND CONSERVATION THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE A SPECIAL. ROLE IN REGULATING WATER ON THE MONTEREY PENINSULA. AND YOU ALSO HAVE A ROLE IN VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IN THE SANTA CRUZ MOUNTAINS WHICH IS A THERMONUCLEAR ISSUE A BIT SO. AND SO JUST FOR THE RECORD WE TALKED ABOUT ALL THOSE THINGS AND ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THEM. NOW I HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IN THE FIRST ONE. IS MORE GLOBAL BOOK ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT EXISTS HAS EXISTED FOR THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AS THE CULTURE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND IT. YOU KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT A DEAL WAS WRITTEN ON A NAPKIN IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY AND THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF ISSUES AND THAT. THE PEOPLE THAT PRECEDED YOU IMMEDIATELY WERE APPOINTED TO ADDRESS THIS IS THIS ISN'T JUST YOU IT FITS PEOPLE COMING IN BEHIND. WHAT'S YOUR VIEW OF YOUR ROLE. OF THE SORT OF DEALING WITH THE ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE CULTURE. AT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. THANK YOU SENATOR PER THAT QUESTION. MY ROLE IS- I AM SURE IT IS SOMETHING THAT STARTS WITH THE LEADERSHIP OF THE ORGANIZATION SO AS A LEADER IN THIS ORGANIZATION I NEED TO LEAD BY EXAMPLE AND NOT LEADING WITH TECH READY IT MEANS- WORKING WITH MY FELLOW COMMISSIONERS WHO I THINK MADE IT- VERY POSITIVE SHIPS AND THE WORK THAT THEY HAVE DONE WHICH CAN BE SEEN FROM. SEVERAL EXAMPLES INCLUDING- LOOKING AT OUR OUR DECENTRALIZATION EFFORTS TO HAVE MORE OF A PRESENCE AND BOTH- SACRAMENTO AND IN LOS ANGELES- HAVING- MORE STREAMLINED ENFORCEMENT PROCESSES I THINK ONE OF THE EXAMPLES IS OUT OF THE PG&amp;E BANKRUPTCY WE HAVE AN AND- HAMSTEAD FORCE MEANT PROCESS THAT ULTIMATELY IF THE UTILITY DOESN'T HI WITH BILL- LEAD TO IT IT ISSOLVING AND I DON'T THINK ANY OTHER PUBLIC UTILITIES GEN. THREE THOUSAND THAT KIND OF ENFORCEMENT PROCESS I THINK WE'VE ALSO MADE CHANGES REGARDING- OUR CONFIDENTIALITY- TOOLS AND REGARDS TO WHO BEARS THE BURDEN OF SHOWING WHAT. WHAT CAN BE BY UNDER AND REALLY PUBLIC. AND WE'VE MADE CHANGES TO OUR RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE- THAT ARE ALSO CONSISTENT WITH LEGISLATIVE. FORTY THREE ON TAXES SOME OF. THOSE BE EXAMPLES- AND I THINK THAT- MY FELLOW COMMISSIONERS HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AND I HOPE TO CONTINUE ALONG THAT PATH AND REINFORCE THOSE CHANGES AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE OPERATING IN A TRANSPARENCY- MANNER. GREAT AND I THINK IT EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE JUST SPENT A BRIEF AMOUNT OF TIME ON THAT THAT IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST PARAMOUNT THINGS ABOUT YOUR SERVICE. AND YOUR APPOINTMENT SO IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO HEAR THAT COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE THAT. THAT CHANGE IS NOT ACCOUNTABILITY. I THINK THERE ARE PLENTY OF THINGS TO ASK ABOUT MAYBE THE OTHER ONE I WANT TO AND WE TALKED ABOUT IT IT'S IN OUR MEETING YESTERDAY. IS ELEVEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS NOW OR WITH COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION THEY HAVE. LOOK FOR WAYS TO DO RENEWABLE ENERGY AS PART OF THE PORTFOLIO AND COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION HAS HAD A MIXED REVIEW AT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION I KNOW I HAPPEN TO REPRESENT ONE OF THE STRONGEST ONES THAT GOES FROM SANTA CRUZ TO SANTA BARBARA COUNTY. AND OFFERS RATES THAT ARE LOWER THAN THE COMPETING RATES OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES. WHAT'S YOUR VIEW ABOUT COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION AND HOW IT FITS% INTO THE SCHEME THAT YOU WILL DEAL WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. THE COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION HAS INCREASED RAPIDLY IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AND I THINK THAT- IT CHANGES THE DYNAMIC AND HOW THE UC REGULATES AND WE ARE WORKING THROUGH- THOSE DYNAMICS SO IT IT DOES CREATE CHANGES TO HOW WE REGULATE I THINK A COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS ALSO CAN PROVIDE. ADVANTAGES BY REPRESENTING THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES THEY'RE SMALLER SO THEY- HAVE SOME ADVANTAGES IN BEING ABLE TO IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS THAT ARE TARGETED TO SERVE THEIR CUSTOMERS IN WAYS THAT MAKE IT A LARGER LARGER UTILITIES MAY HAVE MORE DIFFICULTIES WITH- BUT AGAIN IF IT DOES CHANGE THE WAY WE DO THINGS SO I THINK IT'S- GONNA REQUIRE. BALANCING THE INTEREST OF ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS MAKING SURE THAT THAT COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATE CUSTOMERS ARE ABLE TO HAVE FAIR AFFORDABLE REASONABLE RATES WHILE AT THE SAME TIME BALANCING THE ISSUE OF. ENSURING THAT SOME OF OUR MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT MAY NOT BE PART OF IT YOU CHOICE AGGREGATE ARE- BEARING THE BURDEN OF ADDITIONAL COST- SO IT WILL BE A BALANCING ACT BUT- AND I THAT SOME. THERE'S A LOT OF PROMISE AND LOOK AT HOW WE FORWARD BUT WITH THIS NEW- SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT ARE THAT ARE STEPPING UP. THANK YOU AND I THINK YOU'VE HEARD THE CONCERN FROM HERE ABOUT IT TO JUST REMEMBER THAT CONCERN IS OUT THERE IN THE BALANCING THERE IS A REAL DESIRE TO MAKE SURE THAT IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT- LEAVE IT AT THAT WHAT THE OTHER- COMMITTEE MEMBERS ASPEN APPRECIATE YOUR- WILLINGNESS TO SERVE AND THANKS FOR BEING RESPONSIVE TO MY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SENATOR MEADOW VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU I AM AN- SHE ATE OF THE OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAD TO HAVE. OUR I CALL IT IN PERSON IT WAS IN THE ZOOM MEETING YESTERDAY AND I APPRECIATED- THE CONVERSATION AND YOU HIT ON THE TOPICS THE MOST THOUGHTS CERTAINLY MOST CONCERN TO ME PERSONALLY BUT TO MY DISTRICT AND I'M SURE OFF ALL OF- ARE CAN ALL OF OUR- COLLEAGUES DISTRICTS BECAUSE IT IT TOUCHES US ALL IN. YOU SAID THEY WERE YOUR TOP PRIORITY CERTAINLY ISSUE ARE BEGIN THIS YEAR AND WHEN IS THE **** ENERGY METERING AND I THINK THAT KIND. TALK ABOUT IN TERMS OF BALANCING AND THE FACT THAT TO OUR- THE WEALTHIER HOUSEHOLDS ARE REALLY HAVE AN ADVANTAGE OVER OUR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES IN TERMS OF THE NET ENERGY METERING NET INNER G. METERING ESPECIALLY AND I AM WONDERING AND WE HAD A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT USE THE TERM BALANCE. BUT I THINK I'D LIKE SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC IF YOU'RE YOU'RE AT THAT POINT IN THE YEAR DISCUSSION WITH YOUR YOUR COLLEAGUES ON THE BOARD- ARE YOU DEVELOPING ANY CRITERIA BY WHICH YOU CAN EVALUATE. POTENTIAL CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM ARE STILL THAT YOU'RE MOVING TOWARDS BALANCING IT WILL BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT I BELIEVE BECAUSE THOSE WHO ARE BENEFITING BY- THE CURRENT PROGRAM. WITH THE- THE SOLAR ENERGY TO THE HOMES OF ARE GOING TO AT SOME POINT BE IMPACTED AS THEY YOU KNOW THE PROMISES MADE THEY WILL FEEL WE'RE NOT CAP TO BECAUSE THEY WERE ARE INCENTIVIZED TO DO THAT BY THE FACT THAT THEY ARE GETTING CREDIT RATHER THAN MAKING A LARGE PAYMENT BUT OBVIOUSLY THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF. ENERGY DELIVERY TO THEIR HOMES AND BUSINESSES ARE CLEARLY REQUIRED MORE INVESTMENT HE ON THE GRID AND ALL THE TRANSMISSION ALL THAT SO WE'RE HOPING AT THIS POINT TIME WE'RE GOING TO SEE SOMETHING COMING THAT'S NOT JUST PROCESS DISCUSS BUT ACTUAL PROGRAM DISCUSSED OF WHAT POTENTIAL CHANGES YOU MIGHT BE CONSIDERING OFF FOR. THEIR. AUTO PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR. THANK YOU SENATOR YES WE CURRENTLY HAVE AN OPEN PROCEEDING OFTEN REFER TO IS NOW THREE POINT OH- WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PARTIES AND NOT PROCEEDING THAT HAVE- VARYING PERSPECTIVES ON HOW WE SHOULD PROCEED REGARDING- OUR NAME DECISION THERE IS A ROBUST RECORD BEING DEVELOPED RIGHT NOW THERE'S GOING TO BE A NUMBER OF WORKSHOPS- THERE'S GOING TO BE TESTIMONY TAKE AND BRIEFING ON THE ISSUE. IT IS AN OPEN PROCEEDING SO I DON'T WANT TO PREJUDGE ANY DECISIONS THAT MAY BE COMING OUT I AM FOLLOWING IT CLOSELY IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT SEATING THAT IS A PRIORITY TO THE COMMISSION AND WE DO ANTICIPATE THAT THERE WILL BE A DECISION COMING OUT LATER THIS YEAR- EARLY NEXT YEAR. AND- AND WE'RE WE ARE DEFINITELY LOOKING AT- WHAT THE CURRENT SITUATION. IS AND- TAKING ACCOUNT OF ALL THE INFORMATION THAT WE'RE GETTING TO IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A FAIR. DECISION I AM HAPPY TO TALK TO OUR- GA DIRECTOR AND WE CAN PROVIDE YOU SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON NOT PROCEEDING AND WHERE WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF- MAKING THOSE DECISIONS BUT WE DO ANTICIPATE A DECISION BEING ISSUED SOMETIME AYE AYE AGAIN IT BY THE END OF THIS YEAR OR VERY. WE'LL TAKE IT OUT THAT CERTAINLY ARE COMFORTING TO HEAR- HOPEFULLY IT'LL BE IN FRONT OF LEGISLATION THAT'S- CURRENTLY IN THE HOPPER THAT WOULD DO IT LEGISLATIVELY THERE ARE PERHAPS BEFORE YOU'RE COMING OUT WITH. YOUR CRITERIA AND SOME PRIORITIZATION OF YOU MAY HAVE TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION BECAUSE AGAIN THE BALANCE. BECOMES EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO BOTH SIDES OF THE ISSUE ARE CLEARLY AND IT'S ALWAYS IMPORTANT SHOW THAT OUR PUBLIC KNOWS. THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE BEFORE THEM AND THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN. ON THE IMPACT THAT THEY SEE BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE GOING FORWARD SO THERE IS A BALANCE AND- EVERYBODY'S GONNA SHARE. IN THE BENEFITS AND CERTAINLY A LITTLE BIT OF THE BURDENS IF THAT'S GOING TO BE THE DECISION. ARE YOU ALSO SET A TOP PRIORITY WAS BROADBAND ARE NOT GOING TO GET INTO THAT DEEPLY- I KNOW SOME OF THE OTHER ON COLLEAGUES HERE WILL WANT TO ASK ABOUT THAT. BUT OUR DISCUSSION WAS ABOUT THE- COMMENT THAT'S BEEN MADE OF- QUITE A NUMBER OF TIMES BY FELLOW OF SENATE COLLEAGUE REGARDING THE FACT THAT WE PUTTING A LOT OF MONEY INTO. A DIGITAL DIVIDE ISSUES SUB THE MIDDLE THE MIDDLE MAN AND I THINK IT'S CALLED. THAT WE DON'T SEE ANY ON ANY PROJECTS YET AND I A LOT OF IT IS GOING TO. THE NON PROFITS BUT HOW WITHOUT YOU KNOW GETTING US TO. ACTUALLY DEVELOPING THAT TERM THAT VERY NECESSARY MIDDLE AS PART OF. YOU KNOW THE DELIVERY OF NUMBER OF FASTER AND BROADER AND ACTUALLY HAVING A BROAD BEYOND SO I JUST PUT THAT OUT THERE FOR YOU TO GIVE A BRIEF. THAW RESPONSE ACTUALLY ON A WHAT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND I DID IN OUR OUR MEETING ASK YOU IF YOU HAVE ANY SPECIFICS. THAT YOU COULD PROVIDE TERMS OF HOW YOU'RE APPROACHING THAT IN TERMS OF THE MONEY LOTS OF MONEY LOTS OF MONEY OVER SEVERAL YEARS THAT'S GONE INTO THEIR PHONE I THINK THE BUDGET NOW SHOWS ABOUT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. WHERE THE PROJECTS ARE. DO WE HAVE SOMETHING YOU KNOW READ. SOMETHING TANGIBLE THAT WE'RE TAUGHT OKAY AT THIS POINT IN TIME. THANK YOU SENATOR YES WE HAVE- CEMEX MAP ON WHERE INFRASTRUCTURE AND- WILL NEED TO GO CURRENTLY- THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED AYE I THINK AS YOU SAID A SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR INFRASTRUCTURE- EXPANSION IN BROADBAND AND- FOUR MILLION OF THAT- WE'LL BE LOOKING AT STUFF- GOING TO WHAT WAS REFERRED TO AS THE MIDDLE MILE WHICH CAN'T WAIT TO- SOMETHING I CAN TO TRANSMISSION LINES FOR ELECTRIC SYSTEMS THAT WILL BASICALLY BE. ABLE TO- PROVIDE EXTENSIONS- AND FILL GAPS IN AREAS THAT ARE EITHER UNDERSERVED OR UNSERVED AND THEN ANOTHER THREE BILLION LOOKING AT WHAT'S REFERRED TO AS LAST MILE WHICH IS- THE ACTUAL CONNECTION. THAT MINDSET THAT CONNECTS THE CUSTOMERS TO. THE SYSTEM AND- WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS- CREATING THIS INFRASTRUCTURE IN A WAY THAT PROVIDES OPEN ACCESS WHICH WOULD ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TRIBES AND OTHER ENTITIES TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE SYSTEM AT A REASONABLE RATE RIGHT NOW- WE'RE MISSING INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS CREATED GAPS AND THE SERVICE AND WE ALSO HAVE- PROVIDERS THAT ARE OPERATING SYSTEMS THAT. ARE EITHER CONGESTED FOR THERE'S DIFFICULTY IN ACCESSING IT BECAUSE IT'S NOT AN OPEN ACCESS SYSTEM SO WHAT WE'RE HOPING TO DO IS- BE ABLE TO. ASSIST WITH OTHER AGENCIES TO BE ABLE TO GET THIS FUNDING OUT THEIR BILL THESE GAPS AND MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE OPEN ACCESS SERVICE TO- CALIFORNIA CUSTOMERS I THINK OVER THIS LAST YEAR WITH THE PANDEMIC WE'VE SEEN A CRITICAL NEED. FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA TO BE SERVED BY BROADBAND- FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES WORK RELATED PURPOSES AND- TELEMEDICINE ARE ARE ALL BECOMING CRITICAL AND IN ORDER FOR- CALIFORNIA TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO. HAVE ACCESS AND THIS I BELIEVE WOULD BE A GOOD INVESTMENT FOR CALIFORNIA TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT I AGREE WITH YOU- IT'S A BIG INVESTMENT AND WE NEED TO COMMIT TO MAKE SURE THE PROJECTS ARE BUILT AND THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED. THANK YOU INTENSIFIED GREAT THAT THE THOSE TWO ISSUES THAT. NOW MAY ON THE BROAD MANNER YOUR TOP PRIORITIES BECAUSE YOU BRING SOME FOR SOME. ODD TO THE DISCUSSION AT YOUR OWN BOARD I'M GOING OUT ON. COMPLETE MY QUESTION IS WHEN I BROUGHT UP YESTERDAY WHICH IS FEET BASICALLY VERY DISTRICTS SPECIFIC. AND I'M GONNA READ THE QUESTION BECAUSE IT COMES FROM OUR SEVERAL CONSTITUENTS AND I THINK I SHARED WITH YOU MAN. A COUPLE OF THE PROJECTS THAT HAVE GONE SIDEWAYS OR APPEAR TO HAVE GONE SIDEWAYS FOR MUCH. MIGHT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED AND THEY ARE NOT. ACTUALLY BUILT AND DIDN'T SEEM TO COMPLY. WITH OF SECRET DOCUMENTS DOCUMENTS SHOW THAT WAS PROVIDED AND I'M I'M NOT SURE ON EITHER ONE OF THESE ONE IS QUITE OD AND- THERE'S SOME CURRENT ONES AND I'M NOT SURE WHETHER. YOU SEE. IS A CERTIFYING- HE KNOW OF. AGENCY FOR THE SEQUEL BUT THE QUESTION IS WHEN APPROVING A TRANSMISSION LINE PROJECT. WITH CERTAIN SEQUEL REQUIREMENTS. HOW DOES P. YOU SEE ENSURE THE PROJECT IS BUILT TO WHAT WAS APPROVED. AND WHAT RECOURSE OR PROCESS TO LANDOWNERS TO RATEPAYERS. HAVE WITH P. C. P. YOU SEE IF THEY BELIEVE THE PROJECT WAS BUILT OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH WHAT. ON THE EVE SYKORA AND IF YOU SEE ACTUALLY APPROVED. AND THOSE ARE OUR- YOU KNOW SPECIFIC TO PROJECTS IN THE THIRTY SIX SENATE DISTRICT. BETTER OF A COUPLE OF THEM ARE NOW. BECOMING SOMEWHAT CONTROVERSY OLD HAND I'M NOT SURE HOW TO DIRECT MY CONSTITUENTS AWARE. WHERE THEY FOLLOW THROUGH THEIR COMPLAINT AND IF THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT IS P. YOU SEE ON. THERE THERE ARENA OUGHT. TO WEIGH IN WHERE DO THEY GO FROM THERE. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- THE P. YOU SEE DOES APPROVED CERTAIN- TRANSMISSION POWER LINES AND SUBSTATIONS AND IF IT IS IF YOU SEE PROJECT WE DO HAVE- WHAT ARE CALLED COMPLIANCE MANAGERS ARE INVESTIGATORS THAT YOU GO OUT AND MONITOR- WHAT'S HAPPENING DURING CONSTRUCTION AND ALSO REVIEW POST- CONSTRUCTION COMPLETION OF PROJECTS IF A PROJECT IS NOT COMPLIANT WITH THE DECISION OR- THE ENVIRONMENTAL. REQUIREMENTS FROM THE C. FOR REVIEW- CITATIONS OR PENALTIES CAN BE ISSUED AND- I OWE YOU O BE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH WITHOUT MEDICATION- IF THEY'RE NOT DOING NOT FOR CONSTITUENTS OR CUSTOMERS DON'T THINK IT- WE MAY HAVE THE INFORMATION REGARDING THE SITUATION- A COMPLAINT CAN BE FILED FORMALLY AND OUR- PROCESS YOUR RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE YOU CAN ALSO CALL OUR STAFF IN REPORTS ANY- NON COMPLIANCE ISSUES AND TALK WITH OUR STAFF. THEY CAN LET YOU KNOW IF THE PROJECT WAS ONE THAT THAT WE SPECIFICALLY APPROVED AND IF NOT- THE LEAD AGENCY WOULD BE AND THEN TALK TO YOU ABOUT ADDITIONAL REPORTS THAT- YOU MAY HAVE EITHER THROUGH THE P. YOU SEE OR PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTOR- YOU TO THE APPROPRIATE LOCAL ENTITIES HAVE. PERMITTED PROJECT. THANK YOU THAT WAS VERY CLEAR AND I WILL THAT ON THANK YOU AGAIN FOR SPENDING TIME WITH ME YESTERDAY AND ANSWERING ALL THESE QUESTIONS MORE IN MORE DETAIL TODAY I APPRECIATE THAT THANKS AGAIN. THANK YOU SENATOR CENTER GROVE. AND THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AT THANK YOU THANK YOU S. DIRECTOR FOR MEETING WITH ME YESTERDAY- I COMMISSIONER I GUESS I SHOULD SAY I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH I'M JUST GOING TO FOLLOW UP ON A COUPLE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I ASKED YESTERDAY- YOU KNOW- WE TALKED ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE IN THE PRICING FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY VERSES FOR UTILITIES VERSES THE- COASTAL AREA LIKE MY COLLEAGUE IN SANTA CRUZ- WHO OPENS A WINDOW AT NIGHT I'M SURE AND DOESN'T NEED AN AIR CONDITIONER SAY WITH MY COLLEAGUE IN LOS ANGELES SHE SIMILAR TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY AREA WHERE YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN AIR CONDITIONER. IN OUR DISTRICTS AND INDIVIDUAL OF OUR STATE WHERE THE SENATE PRO TEM REPRESENTS I DON'T THINK IT EVER GETS OVER SEVENTY FIVE DEGREES I COULD BE WRONG BUT- PAGE. IMPACTED OUR A- ARE NICE SAN DIEGO BREEZE OKAY SO AND THE LAST FEW DAYS SPECIFICALLY IN MY AREA IT'S BEEN A HUNDRED AND NINE AND A HUNDRED AND TEN DEGREES I THINK LOS ANGELES I MAY NOT HAVE THOSE HIGH NUMBERS BUT- IT IS SIGNIFICANTLY HOTTER IN OUR DISTRICTS THAN IT IS- OVER ON THE COAST. THERE WAS A RECENTLY HELD- THE CPC RECENTLY HELD A HEARING RECOGNIZING THE PARTICULARLY HIGH ELECTRICITY RATES IN CALIFORNIA AND IN FACT CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRICITY RATES ARE DOUBLE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE- THE WHITE PAPER FROM THAT MEETING BASICALLY KINDA I DON'T SEE BRUSHES IT OFF THE BRUSHES IT OFF SAYS MOST CALIFORNIANS ELECTRICITY BILLS ARE RELATIVELY LOW WHICH IS TRUE. THAT'S ON PAGE SEVEN OF THE WHITE PAPER THAT WAS PROVIDED AND BUT THAT'S TRUE FOR THE COASTAL AREAS AND MAYBE IN THE SAN DIEGO AREA BUT IT'S NOT TRUE FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE INDIVIDUALS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY LOS ANGELES OR THE REGION'S. AND WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO CONSTITUENTS LIKE IN MY DISTRICT OR LOS ANGELES- THAT FACE TRIPLE DIGIT TEMPERATURES FOR THE SUMMER MENCE THAT HAVE EXTREMELY HIGH. UTILITY RATES I MEAN SOME OF THEM EVEN IF YOU KEEP YOUR AIR CONDITIONER THEY'RE NOT ON YOU'RE NOT. ABLE TO BE ON THE CARES PROGRAM BECAUSE YOU'RE A WORKING CALIFORNIAN THAT MAKES FAST ENOUGH TO NOT BE ON THE CARES PROGRAM. AND THESE INDIVIDUALS MIGHT FACE EVEN KEEPING THEIR AIR CONDITIONER EIGHTY DEGREES A SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLAR P. GENIE BILL OR ELECTRICITY BILL AND WHICH IS ABOUT. PROBABLY A THIRD OF THEIR INCOME. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AND AS AS WE DISCUSSED WHEN WE MET AFFORDABILITY IS. A CRITICAL ISSUE THAT'S FRONT AND CENTER AT THE COMMISSION RIGHT NOW WE- NEED TO DO FOLLOW UP FROM OUR END BOND WE ALSO HAVE AN OPEN PORTABILITY PRECEDING THAT RECENTLY ISSUED. A REPORT AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT REPORT RECOGNIZES AS AS YOU'VE INDICATED SENATOR THAT- WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT AFFORDABILITY FROM A REGIONAL LEVEL AS OPPOSED TO A STATEWIDE LEVEL BECAUSE THERE'S DIFFERENT INCOMES- WITHIN DIFFERENT REGIONS AND THERE'S DIFFERENT- CLIMATE FACTORS WITHIN THOSE REGIONS. AND SO WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING METRICS THAT WILL HELP US BE ABLE TO LOOK AT- AFFORDABILITY ACROSS ALL OF OUR UTILITY SECTORS AND LOOKING AT IT. FROM A REGIONAL PERSPECTIVE TO ASSIST US IN DEVELOPING BETTER PROGRAMS LOOKING AT POSSIBLE- CHANGES TO OUR RATE DESIGN AND HELPING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ACCOUNTING FOR AFFORDABILITY BITE BY HOUSEHOLD LEVEL- AS AS YOU NOTED- OUR OUR ELECTRICITY- HELLO END IF YOU LOOK AT NATIONAL AVERAGES ARE ARE BILLED AS A STATE ARE ON THE LOWER END FOR NATURAL THE NATIONAL AVERAGES BUT WE SEE A TREND. THAT THOSE RATES ARE INCREASING AND WE'RE PARTICULARLY NOTING THAT- THERE ARE REGIONAL. IMPACTS THAT NEED TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR- SO WHAT WHAT WHAT I WOULD SAY TO- THE CONSTITUENTS FACING THOSE ISSUES IS THAT WE DO HAVE THIS RECEDING WE ARE LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE. WE ARE HOPING- TO BE ABLE TO HAVE METRICS THAT WILL ALLOW US FOR. TWO ACCOUNTS FOR THESE REGIONAL DIFFERENCES AND- HOUSEHOLD INCOME FACTORS AND THAT IT BE- NEED. CUSTOMER PARTICIPATION MORE CONSTITUENT PARTICIPATION AND- I ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL BE DOING MORE WORKSHOPS AND OUTREACH AND- THIS AGAIN REMAINS A ISSUE THAT IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE AND A TOP PRIORITY FOR US AND WE LOOKING AT IT HOW WE ASSESS AFFORDABILITY- ON A REGIONAL BASIS. THANK YOU MA'AM VERY MUCH FOR THAT RESPONSE I REALLY APPRECIATE IT- I AM ECSTATICALLY EXCITED THAT- YOU SEE CALIFORNIA IN DIFFERENT REGIONS AND- HOW DIFFERENT REGIONS CAN HAVE AS A LARGE VARIANCE OF- I'VE UTILITY RATES. JUST BASED ON ON THE CLIMB INTO THE AREA OF THE REGION IS AND SO- YOU KNOW AS THERE'S ALWAYS FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS REGARDING RATE REALLY FOR RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS THROUGH THE PROGRAMS LIKE HERE. BUT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF RATE RELIEF SOLUTIONS FOR INDUSTRIAL OR AGRICULTURAL CUSTOMERS HE'S ELECTRICITY RATES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER. THAN COMPETITORS IN NEIGHBORING STATES. THE REASON WHY I ASK THAT IS. IN MY DISTRICT WE HAVE THE LARGEST A- TAITO PRODUCER I GUESS ANY FINGERLING MANY POTATO. PURPLE POTATO YELLOW POTATO THOSE LITTLE MINI ROUND ONES THAT YOU BUY AT COSTCO OR WALMART OR- I HAVE BONDS I MEAN THEY'RE SOLD EVERYWHERE SO FINGERLINGS THAT'S A SPECIALTY AS WELL- TO REFRIGERATE THEM IT THE RATES- HAVE ALMOST QUADRUPLED IN THE LAST YEAR FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO REFRIGERATED. THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT MOVING TO ARIZONA. JUST A WAREHOUSE OR STUFF BECAUSE IT WOULD BE CHEAPER TO TRANSPORT THEM VIA TRACK. YOU KNOW ACROSS STATE LINES WHERE THEY NEEDED TO BE DISTRIBUTED THEN IT WOULD BE T. PAY UTILITY RATES- ALSO- YOU LARGEST BABY CARE PRODUCER IN THE WORLD IS IN MY DISTRACTION TO MY COLLEAGUE MR TUDOSE DISTRICT BUT IN KERN COUNTY. AND THEY HIS SIT FACE THE SIMILAR SITUATION- THEY'VE ACTUALLY STARTED PURCHASING LANDIN AND PROPERTY IN GEORGIA. WE HATE TO LOSE THOSE BUSINESSES- BUT ONE OF THE MAIN FACTORS THAT THEY'VE DECIDED. IS UTILITY RATES- FOR REFRIGERATING THESE PRODUCTS WHETHER IT'S POTATOES CARROTS PLUMS APPLES DOESN'T MATTER. AND THE UTILITY RATES IS THERE A SOLUTION THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE REGARDING THE ECONOMIC BURDENS THAT THE STATE'S BUSINESSES AND FARMS FACE BECAUSE OF THE HIGH UTILITY. RATES- ELECTRICITY RATES. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- SENATOR AYE AGAIN A PORTABILITY- IS VERY IMPORTANT- TO THE PC AND WE ARE. LOOKING AT DIFFERENT WAYS TO- ANALYZE FORTY BOARD ABILITY FOR DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT SECTORS OF- BOTH THE ECONOMY AND- CUSTOMER BASE I DO NOT HAVE. A SPECIFIC ANSWER REGARDING A PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE- THAT MAY BE GEARED SPECIFICALLY TOWARDS AGRICULTURE BUT- I CAN FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR OFFICE AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IF YOU WOULD ALLOW ME TO DO THAT. I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. THE LAST QUESTION I HAVE IS- I'M SURE IT'S ALL ON OUR MIND BECAUSE THE COLONIAL HACK RIGHT AND- WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT YESTERDAY THE COLONIAL PIPELINE HACKEN AND I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST THREATS THAT WE FACE IN THEM ARE UTILITIES. IS OUR ENERGY IS THE ENERGY GET ITSELF- AND THE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE THAT WE HAVE FOR HACKING THE ENERGY GRID AND SHUTTING DOWN AND THE STATE'S POWER. AS WE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT NEW TECHNOLOGY THERE IS A COMPANY IN- THE SENATE PROTEAMS DISTRICT ACTUALLY AND I THINK SHE KNOWS ONE OF THE PRINCIPLES- FROM A PREVIOUS I SEE PREVIOUS LIFE I THINK IT'S WHEN SHE'S ON THE CITY COUNCIL. THE M. AS THE EQUITY TECH- HAS ACTUALLY DEVELOPED A TECHNOLOGY RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S BEING USED ON THEM. AT THE SADDLE. PG&amp;E IS IT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON SOUTHERTON THE TEST ACTUALLY THE TEST WAS DEAD. WE SAN DIEGO AT SDG ANNIE SO SAN DIEGO GAS AND- IN WHAT IS IT ESTEY GENE. IT IS ESTY GENIE AND ACTUALLY THEY WERE THE ONES THAT PROVE THE MODEL. IT THAT ALLOWS- THAT PREVENTS- OR THE PENETRATION THAT WOULD TAKE PLACE- I AGAINST OUR UTILITY GRID. ARE YOU GOING TO PURSUE- JUST BECAUSE WE ALL AGREE THAT WE NEED SAFE RELIABLE DEPENDABLE ENERGY PEOPLE WANT TO FLIP THE SWITCH AND HAVE THE LIGHTS COME ON. AND WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO PURSUER AT LEAST HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THOSE PEOPLE THAT WE PROTECT TO LOOK TO LISTEN TO THEIR TECHNOLOGY TO SEE IF IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO ALL OF CALIFORNIANS. I'M NOT PUSHING A CERTAIN COMPANY I'M MISSING IT'S AVAILABLE HERE WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED. IN YES I WOULD BE INTERESTED AYE I KNOW THIS IS AN- IMPORTANT ISSUE ESPECIALLY GIVEN. THE SITUATION BACK EAST WITH THE COLONIAL PIPELINE SO- ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON HOW WE CAN PROTECT OUR- ELECTRIC SYSTEM I WOULD I WOULD BE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I GUESS THE LAST QUESTION I THOUGHT THAT WAS MY LAST BUT I REMEMBERED YESTERDAY THAT WE TALK SIGNIFICANTLY. ABOUT THE PS PS I SHUT OFFS- YOU KNOW DURING THAT SHOWED US LAST YEAR- THE CITY OF TEHACHAPI IN MY DISTRICT AND OTHER CITIES- THROUGHOUT THE STATE- WERE NOTIFIED. BY THE CPUC OR THE ELECTRICAL PROVIDERS THE PROVIDERS. THAT AND THEY WOULD BE EXPERIENCING THE SHUT OFF DUE TO HIGH WINDS OR WINDS AND TO PREVENT WILDFIRES. AS SOMETIMES- THERE WAS EITHER ZERO COMMUNICATION OR WAS INCORRECT OR INACCURATE COMMUNICATION SIGNIFICANTLY INTACT BEAM. THEY WERE TOLD A LINE B. OR LINE A WOULD BE SHUT DOWN AND THEY PREPARED FOR THAT AND WAS THE ALTERNATE LINE THAT WE SHUT DOWN WHICH AFFECTED THEIR WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT. AND THE HOSPITAL AND SOME OTHER THINGS HAD TO GO ON BACK UP POWER WHICH THEY WERE NOT PREPARED FOR BECAUSE WHAT THEY WERE NOTIFIED WAS THE OPPOSITE LINE. AND WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT GETTING AND BETTER COMMUNICATION. AND FOR THESE P. S. P. S. AT. ISSUES THAT WE HAVE. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AND THAT THE P. YOU SEE RECENTLY ADOPTED- A DECISION AND AN ORDER INSTITUTING AN INVESTIGATION ON SOME OF THE TWENTY NINETEEN PS PS EVENTS WHERE WE FOUND THAT- THE UTILITIES NEEDED TO IMPROVE THEIR COMMUNICATION AND- TEACH WHAT HAD HAPPENED PREVIOUSLY WE ALSO HAVE ANOTHER DECISION- REGARDING PS PS GUIDELINES THAT ARE BEING UPDATED THAT WILL BE VOTED OUT TOMORROW IN OUR OUR BUDDY. AND MANY OF THE ISSUES YOU TALKED ABOUT REGARDING COMMUNICATION AND NOTICE WERE FRONT AND CENTER- IN REGARDS TO THE REVISIONS ON THE TRIP- ON THE GUIDELINES AND- IT LOOKS THAT YOU KNOW INFORMATION REGARDING CRITICAL FACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE- THE MINIMUM SERVICES THAT ARE GOING TO NEED TO BE PROVIDED DURING YES YES ADVANCE- IT REQUIRES EXERCISES- TO WORK BURKE. AT LEAST ANNUALLY AND THAT- THAT THERE'S EDUCATION AND OUTREACH- AND COMMUNICATION WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND- WE I ASKED IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS AND ENTITIES ON AN ONGOING BASIS SO THAT- WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING THE INFORMATION THEY NEED. TIME TO PREPARE FOR THESE EVENTS TO STAY SAFE AND TO ENSURE THAT- PARTICULARLY OUR MEDICAL BASELINE CUSTOMERS- ARE ABLE TO GET WHAT THEY NEED TO GET THROUGH- THE EVENTS AND NOTIFICATION. ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL- TO THIS EFFORTS AND- WE WILL BE WORKING WITH THE I. O. U.'S AND THE DIFFERENT ENTITIES AND PARTICIPATING IN THESE EXERCISES- WE ENCOURAGE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND ENTITIES TO LET US KNOW IS THEY'RE HAVING PROBLEMS. SO THAT WE CAN ALSO- CONTINUE TO TRACK IT- AS WE'RE DEVELOPING PROCESSES HERE- I DON'T THINK. IF WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE EVENTS WERE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT THAT THEIR NEW MUCH LONGER AND- WE'RE GONNA NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT NOTIFICATIONS OCCURRING SOUNDS THAT- PEOPLE ARE BEING KEPT SAFE DURING. THESE EVENTS. ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE WHOLE PURPOSE IS TO PREVENT OTHER- IT'S PAST REVIEWS FROM NOT HAPPENING SO- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE BEING HANDLED SAFELY XBOX. THANK YOU MA'AM THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING MY QUESTIONS AND FOR MEETING WITH ME YESTERDAY I REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT AND THEM. I LOOK FORWARD TO OF A CONFIRMING YOU ON THIS CONFIRMATION AND DEM. I THINK YESTERDAY THE FIRST QUESTION I ASKED YOU IS WHY. DO YOU WANT TO DO THIS JOB AND- EVERYBODY ON THE CALL KINDA LAUGHED AND YOU SAID YOU GET ASKED THAT QUESTION A LOT. AND EVERYBODY SEEMS TO LAUGH AFTERWARDS ALTHOUGH I TRIED TO ASK IT VERY SERIOUSLY- I APPRECIATE YOU WANTING TO DO THIS JOB. SO THANK YOU MA'AM. THANK YOU SENATOR I. THAT THAT WAS A THAT WAS A VERY RELEVANT LAST QUESTION I'M THINKING ABOUT I THINK I MIGHT IS SAID TO THE SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES THIS IS A SERIOUS JOB. I'M NOT SURE SHE GETS ENOUGH COMPENSATION BUT- AT ANY RATE- THAT'S A DIFFERENT QUESTION AND NOT WANT TO POSE TO YOU OBVIOUSLY WANT TO. COMMENT ON TO THE BUDGET PROCESS- TO THE GOOD SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES SENATOR COM LOCKER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM KERN WHO ASKED A NUMBER OF THE QUESTIONS THAT- I THINK I ASKED YOU AND WE DISCUSSED EARLIER THIS DAY AT TODAY ESPECIALLY AROUND THE RATE AFFORDABILITY. AND I TO ASK YOU KNOW WHY YOU WANT TO DO THIS BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THE UC IS JUST HUGE AND COVERS SO MANY THINGS THAT ARE. INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT NEAR CRITICAL AN- ALMOST SEEMS LIKE THEY SHOULD SORT OF BEING CHUCKED OUT- AND HANDLED. INDEPENDENTLY SO. BLESS YOU ALL FOR THE KIND OF MENTAL STAMINA THAT YOU HAVE FOR WANTING TO DO THIS WORK. FROM I ASKED YOU EARLIER AND SO I'LL ASK YOU AGAIN I HAD A QUESTION ABOUT LIFELINE- WHICH IS A PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES FREE OR DISCOUNTED TELEPHONE SERVICE TO LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AND YOU SHARED WITH ME THE INTRICACIES- IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FEDS. AND THE STATE AS IT RELATES TO LIFELINE NO DURING THE PANDEMIC LAST YEAR THERE WERE SOME CHANGES THAT WERE MADE- I BELIEVE TO- AND IN ORDER TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT OR RE ENROLLMENT AND TO MAKE THINGS A LITTLE MORE USER FRIENDLY FOR FOLKS. SO IT IS ALWAYS INTERESTING THE LESSONS THAT WE LEARN IN TIMES OF CRISIS ON HOW TO MAKE THINGS MORE USER FRIENDLY FOR FOLKS- AND WANTED TO KNOW IF YOU COULD SHARE A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT. THE C. P. UC'S RE VISIONING OF LIFELINE- NOW- AND HOW WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO STREAMLINE THIS PROCESS SEES. A TO MAKE THIS- PROGRAM. MORE ACCESSIBLE TO FOLKS WHO NEED IT- AND THEN ALSO GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE ARE OPERATING IN A MORE AND MORE WITH OUR LAN LINES- BUT WITH MOBILE DEVICES AND SMARTPHONES. AND I KNOW LIFELINE IS I THINK ONE PER HOUSEHOLD. RATHER THAN ONE PER PHONE I'M EVEN THE MOST OF US ARE ATTACHED TO THE PHONE AND- IT HAS BECOME MY LIFELINE AND NO PUN INTENDED SO. JUST WANTED TO KNOW IF YOU COULD SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW- SOME OF THIS REVISION NG- EITHER IS HAPPENING OR OTHER. DISCUSSIONS ABOUT OTHER THINGS IN THE WORKS- THAT COULD MAKE THIS PROGRAM. MORE ACCESSIBLE. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AND- WE DO HAVE A CURRENT OPEN PROCEEDING ON LIFELINE ONE OF THAT- THE- ITEMS IN THAT PROCEEDING IS THAT WE ARE PARTNERING WITH SAC STATE TO ASSESS THE PROGRAM AND EXAMINE WHAT- THE BARRIERS ARE TO PARTICIPATION. AND THE CUSTOMER NEEDS THAT WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT REPORT COMING OUT HOPEFULLY VERY SOON AS SOON AS IT DOES WE WILL BE ABLE TO SHARE IT WITH YOUR OFFICE- THE CURRENT. PROCEEDING RIGHT NOW IS LOOKING AT UPDATES TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RULES TO IMPROVE THE PROGRAM WHICH WILL BE LOOKING AT THIS REPORT THAT WERE WORKING SAC STATE ON- TO UPDATE THE PROGRAM TO ADDRESS- CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED TO STATE AND FEDERAL POLICIES AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES. AS WELL AS UNRESOLVED ISSUES FROM PREVIOUS PROCEEDINGS AND YOU YOU ARE CORRECT SENATOR AT THE MOMENT- IT IS ONE- DEVICE PER HOUSEHOLD SO IT WOULD EITHER BE A LANDLINE OR A- A MOBILE OF A PHONE- WE ALSO- RECENTLY HAD UPDATED B. THE PROGRAM SHE REQUIRE WIRELESS RESERVE PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE LIFELINE PLANS- AT NO COST TO PARTICIPANTS HOWEVER- I DO WANT TO KNOW THE DOT- ISSUE IS IN LITIGATION RIGHT NOW- THE COURT THE FEDERAL COURT HAD OVER TRYING TO THAT AND- IT IS ON IT. HE ALSO WE CAN ALSO FOLLOW UP AS WE HAVE MORE INFORMATION- REGARDING THAT AND THEN WHEN WE SPOKE I ALSO MENTIONED ARE AYE FOSTER PILOT PROGRAM WHICH IS TARGETED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF- OF THE- FOSTER CHILDREN IN THE STATE AND RIGHT NOW IT SERVES ABOUT ELEVEN THOUSAND FOSTER YOUTH BETWEEN THE AGES OF THIRTEEN AND THIRTY SIX AND FIFTY SIX. OF FIFTY EIGHT- SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THAT WE ARE ACTIVELY LOOKING OUT AND WE'RE HOPING THAT- WITH THIS STUDY IN OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH SAC STATE WILL BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH SOME RECOMMENDATIONS VERY SEEN. ON I WENT THROUGH THE PROGRAM. GREAT THANK YOU- BECAUSE I YOU KNOW I THINK. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE LAND LINES- NOT THAT MANY AND THEN THE ONES THAT DO PROBABLY DON'T REALLY EVEN KNOW WHAT THE JACK IS- AND SO I THINK IT'S WORK YOU KNOW CONTINUING TO MOVE INTO- YOU KNOW THE REST OF THIS CENTURY AND BEYOND. YOU KNOW HOW WE CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY TO ALLOW FOR CONNECTIVITY TO BE EASIER FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS TO MANAGE IS REALLY IMPORTANT REGARDLESS OF THEIR INCOME. I'M I KNOW THE VICE CHAIR ASKED A QUESTION ABOUT BROADBAND- AND SO I TO WILL- AND I KNOW WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS- I THINK BASED ON. WELL WE'VE ALL SEEN THE PHOTOS OF THE YOUNG BABIES WHO ARE SITTING OUTSIDE OF TACO BELL- TRYING TO DO THEIR HOMEWORK I THINK WE HAVE ALL HAD AN INSTANCE WHERE THE PHONE CALL HAS DROPPED- WE ARE WALKING AROUND THE BLOCK TRYING TO FIND A PLACE WHERE WE'RE GETTING A GOOD SIGNAL- AND I THINK. EVERYONE AT ONE POINT- HAS YELLED OUT BROADBAND FOR ALL- OUT OF FRUSTRATION OF HAVING YOU KNOW THE PHONE OR THE ZOOM- DROP THE CALL OR OR- STALL OUT. ACCORDING TO THE DATA ON YOUR WEBSITE THERE ARE SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS THAT DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO BROADBAND- WITH STANDARD DOWNLOAD SPEEDS- AND MILLIONS OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE STRUGGLED ACROSS THE VIRTUAL SCHOOL YEAR. I'M IN THE HOUSEHOLDS THAT DON'T HAVE IT OR SPLIT BETWEEN RURAL AND URBAN. AND WE HEAR THE CRIES FOR HELP AND SUPPORT. REALLY FOR MOST OF THE FOLKS ON THE FLOOR WHEN WE ACTUALLY WHEN WE HAVE BILLS THAT COME UP AROUND BROADBAND- AND SO YOU KNOW WE WANTED TO KNOW WHAT THE PLAN WAS FOR CREATING CONNECTIVITY- FOR EACH OF THESE. HOUSEHOLDS AND IF SO IF THERE ARE BENCHMARKS PLATE HOW TO REACH X. NUMBER BY X. YEAR- AND THEN ALSO WANTED TO KNOW- WHAT THE P. YOU SEE YOU CAN DO- TO PREVENT INCUMBENT- PROVIDERS- FROM. THE USE THE OVER USE THE ABUSE YOU CAN USE THE VERB THAT YOU WANT- RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL BECAUSE MANY COMMUNITIES BELIEVE- THAT THIS IS GREATLY DELAYED THERE C. A. S. FUNDED PROJECTS I KNOW I ASKED YOU THIS WHEN WE SPOKE EARLIER. IN THIS ACTUALLY CAME UP AS A POINT OF DISCUSSION WHEN WE HAD ONE OF OUR BROADBAND BILLS UP ON THE SENATE FLOOR- AND SO WANTED TO JUST GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT BECAUSE I DOUBT THAT WE ARE GOING TO RESOLVE THIS. THIS YEAR- AND IT'S A IT'S A MATTER OF THE KIND OF LONG TERM COMMITMENT WE CAN MAKE- NOT ONLY TO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. BUT INTO MANAGING THE RELATIONSHIPS OF ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE INVOLVED. IN THE ISSUE AROUND PROVIDING BROADBAND NETWORKS ROUGHLY. ONE THANK YOU SENATOR AND AS I MENTIONED BEFORE OF BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE IS A- TOP PRIORITY FOR ME AND THE P. YOU SEE I THINK THAT THE CURRENT PROPOSAL THAT WOULD HAVE- THE SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS REFERENCED EARLIER. INVESTED INTO- THIS INFRASTRUCTURE WILL GO A LONG WAY- IF WE CAN GET A SYSTEM THAT IS. OPEN ACCESS AND HAS A NETWORK THAT BASICALLY WILL ALLOW FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TRIBAL ORGANIZATIONS AND- NETWORK PROVIDERS- TO HAVE ACCESS TO THAT- FAIR MARKET RATES- IT WILL GO A LONG WAY TO FILLING THESE GAPS AND HELPING TO IMPROVE OUR CONNECTIVITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE- I THINK COMING OUT OF THE PANDEMIC. WE REALLY SEE THE NEED- FOR INVESTING IN THIS INFRASTRUCTURE AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE IT ACCESSIBLE SO I THINK OPEN ACCESS IS GOING TO BE IT'S GOING TO BE VERY CRITICAL TO DOT. AND THIS IS GOING TO INVOLVE ON DISCUSSIONS. WITH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT AGENCIES- LOOKING AT THE LEGISLATION THAT IS PENDING AS WELL AS- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS THEY HAVE- BUT THE WORK CERTAIN STORIES OVER BROADBAND AS WELL SO. I THINK WE ARE AT- HEY GOOD POINT COMING OUT OF THE PANDEMIC OF THE PUBLIC- REALLY UNDERSTANDING THE NEED TO HAVE BROADBAND FOR US TO CONTINUE- TO HAVE- YOU KNOW WE WE'RE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND WE NEED TO MAINTAIN- TECHNOLOGY AND ACCESS FOR CALIFORNIANS- TO THE INTERNET. TO ENSURE WE- CAN CONTINUE WITH OUR ECONOMY NEEDS YOU- AND SURE PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO EDUCATION- TELEMEDICINE ESPECIALLY FOR RURAL AREAS IS- CRITICAL SO AS I SAID BEFORE YOU CAN FIT INTERNET CONNECTIVITY IS MORE THAN A LUXURY IT'S BECOMING A NEED ESPECIALLY- GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS LAST YEAR SO I THINK- GETTING THESE MIDDLE MILE GAPS IN THESE LAST MILE STILL AND PROVIDING OPEN ACCESS. WILL GO A LONG WAY I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE EASY AND I THINK- IT'S GOING TO BE CHALLENGING BUT I AM HOPING THAT- THE PC WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE IT THE DIFFERENCE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE OTHER AGENCIES THAT HELP RESPONSIBILITY HERE AND- LOOK FORWARD TO. YOU- THE CASF PROGRAM- MOVING FORWARD WITH THE NEXT STAGE. YEAH SO IS IT- IN THE END YOU DO NOT HAVE THE MAGIC WAND OR THE CRYSTAL BALL- HELLO I AM GOOD I'M PUTTING THAT OUT THERE FOR ALL TO NOTE TO ALL FOR ALL TO HEAR- BUT WHAT IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT WE DON'T QUITE HAVE. A PLAN WITH REAL NUMBERS ARE BENCHMARKS- ON HOW TO GET CONNECTIVITY TO THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF FOLKS THAT DON'T YET HAVE IT THAT WE MAY BE WORKING ON IT BUT WITH AS OF TODAY WORDS WE MAY NOT BE THERE YET. I THINK THAT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT WE ARE WORKING ON IT- WE- ARE LOOKING TO SEE- WHAT. THE CASF PROGRAM IS GONNA LOOK LIKE GOING FORWARD IF YOU YOU KNOW THE CURRENT PROPOSED PROPOSAL ALSO TALKS ABOUT DOING- RNP IS AS OPPOSED TO APPLICATIONS AND HOPEFULLY THAT WILL HELP- GET. MORE PROVIDERS AND APPLICATIONS IN THE DORK- AND THE GOAL IS TO GET- YOU KNOW THAT THE FIBER IN THE GROUND TO GET THINGS MOVING BUT I CAN'T GIVE YOU AN EXACT DATES OR TIMEFRAMES- THERE'S STILL A LOT OF QUESTIONS OUT THERE AS FAR AS WHAT THE PARAMETERS WILL BE THAT WILL HAVE TO WORK WITH AND- FORWARD. YEAH THAT THAT'S WHY I PREFACED WHAT I SAID WITH YOU NOT HAVING A MAGIC WAND I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO THINK THAT. THAT WAS ALL LIES ON YOU- YOU DID MENTION LOOKING AT LEGISLATION- WORKING WITH THE FEDS AND THEN BRINGING OTHER AGENCIES TO THE TABLE I WOULD JUST ALSO ENCOURAGE- THAT WE- CONSIDER HOW TO BRING OUR- TELECOM PROVIDERS TO THE TABLE TO BECAUSE THEY ARE ENDING I MEAN THEY'RE CRITICAL TO THIS DISCUSSION- AND- THE REALITY IS THAT MOST CALIFORNIANS DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE P. YOU SEE DOES. AND THERE THEY DON'T HAVE THIS VERY INTRICATE WEB OF AGENCIES AND CONNECTIONS THAT WE MAY HAVE OR KNOW ABOUT WHEN THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW COME THEY CAN'T MAKE A CALL- AND BUT WHAT THEY DO NOW- ARE LIKE THE NAMES OF THE- THINGS THAT COME TO THEM IN THE MAIL EACH MONTH ASKING THEM FOR PAYMENT. AND WHAT THEY DO NOW IS THE DEVICE THAT THEY HAVE. AND WHETHER OR NOT IT'S WORKING OR NOT AND SO IT REALLY IS INCUMBENT UPON GOVERNMENT- AND WE ARE PART OF GOVERNMENT- THE LEGISLATURE. TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO HELP TRANSLATE ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS- IN ISSUES INTO SOMETHING THAT THAT FOLKS CAN UNDERSTAND- BUT THEN ALSO TO HELP CREATE SOLUTIONS AND PATHWAYS. THAT MAKE EQUAL SENSE- AND SO I SAY THAT BECAUSE- WHILE SOMETIMES THERE MAY BE TENSION. BETWEEN ALL OF THE PARTIES WE REALLY HAVE AN OBLIGATION AND A RESPONSIBILITY TO WORK TOGETHER- BECAUSE- CONNECTIVITY IS. PART OF LIFE NOW I MEAN YOU WE'VE BECOME CODES AND DEVICES- IN ALL OF THIS AND SO. BEING THAT WE'RE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD I'M THE RICHEST IN THE ASSETS THAT WE HAVE WE REALLY HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW FROM SAN DIEGO TO Y. RICA- WE ARE FIGURING OUT WAYS TO CONNECT EVERYBODY- TO THE SERVICES AND TO THE PEOPLE ON THE DAY THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO BE CONNECTED TO- SO THAT'S ALL I'M GONNA SAY I THINK YOU- GOOD LUCK SISTER. I MEAN YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT- AND I HOPE YOU CONSIDER YOU KNOW US PARTNERS- EVEN WHEN WE'RE UPSET BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE REALLY ALL WORKING TOWARDS THE SAME GOAL. THANK YOU SENATOR WELL ON A LOT OF TOPICS COVERED OUR I CHECKED HIM OFFICE AS PEOPLE WERE GOING DOWN THE LIST AND MAKE IT PRETTY MUCH COVERED ABOUT EVERY. QUESTION THAT I COULD HAVE ALSO BROUGHT UP I WOULD- I WOULD SAY THE ISSUE OF US CYBERSECURITY IS BECOMING MORE OF A CONCERN FROM SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE CAUCUS AND- I'M GLAD OF THAT QUESTION WAS ASKED BECAUSE ON JUST FROM A GENERAL STANDPOINT.
