WHO HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS TO- OFFER THEM UP NOW I SAW CENTER HERTZBERG AND SENATOR NELSON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU FOR ALL THOSE WHO TOOK THE TIME TO TESTIFIED TODAY BEFORE THE SENATE HEARING. MORE MAKE SOME COMMENTS BECAUSE THIS IS BEEN AN ISSUE I'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH IN. FOR MANY DECADES AND HARM DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT ELECTIONS AND VOTING. THE PROCESS INCLUSION AND FIGURING OUT WAYS AS WE LEARN TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND ALL HOST OF WAYS TO MAKE VOTING WORK WE HAVE GRAPPLED WITH THIS ISSUE SINCE THE CONSTITUTION WAS ADOPTED WHEN ONLY PROTESTANT WHITE MEN. WHO OWNED LAND COULD VOTE AND WE HAVE SINCE ENGAGED IN A VERY DETAILED AND DIFFICULT DISCUSSION OF WHAT VOTING MEANS AND HOW WE DEAL WITH IT- IN CALIFORNIA UNTIL NINETEEN THIRTEEN MOST OF THE STATE BUDGET BEFORE WE ACTUALLY HAD A FORMALIZED STATE BUDGET WAS FUNDED BY THE POLL TAX WHAT THAT MEANS. THE MEN ONLY PEOPLE THAT HAD MONEY WHO COULD AFFORD TO VOTE ACTUALLY PARTICIPATED IN TERMS OF WHAT KIND OF REPRESENTATION WE REALLY HAD IN CALIFORNIA- WE'VE HAD IS WITH AS MANY NO LITERACY TESTS THAT WERE EXCLUSIONARY AS DEVOTED TO THE IDEA OF VOTING IS A BALANCE IN THE ULTIMATE BALANCE SHOULD BE INFORMED BY. INSURING THAT YOU HAVE THE GREATEST LEVEL OF PARTICIPATION BY THE GREATEST NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE THE AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE TESTIFIED THAT WE SEE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF TURNOUT SINCE EISENHOWER WAS PRESIDENT NOTHING LESS THAN EXTRAORDINARY. TODAY WE HAVE TECHNOLOGIES THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT SOMEBODY MIGHT GET A BALLOT FOR SOMEBODY WAS DECEASED THAT CAN CHECK THOSE THINGS OUT I INTRODUCED THIS VERY BILL IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN WHEN I CAME BACK TO THE SENATE BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT AT THE TIME A NUMBER OF REGISTRAR'S THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA DID NOT SUPPORTED BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T FEEL TECHNOLOGICALLY. THAT THEY WERE READY TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ON THIS KIND OF. ADDITIONAL INCREASE IN WORK AND THEY CLEARLY HAVE DONE SO NOW AND CLEARLY WE'VE SEEN AS A RESULT OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S HANDLING OF THE SELECTION THEY'VE DONE SO PRETTY BRILLIANTLY AND THAT THEY REALLY HE HAS NOT BEEN ANY. OF WIDESPREAD FRAUD AND TO THE EXTENT THAT SOME OF THE BE RESPECTFUL OF SOME OF THOSE WHO TESTIFIED WHICH I CERTAINLY AM. THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN THE BALLOT. THAT SO IF SOMEBODY RECENTLY DECEASED THE BALANCE OF THAT IS WHAT'S THE IMPACT ON SOCIETY FOR PEOPLE THAT DON'T GET BALLOTS. FOR PEOPLE THAT- YOU KNOW I DID LEGISLATION SOME YEARS AGO DEALING WITH- TRYING TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE THIRTY DAY REGISTRATIONS SOMEBODY WHO WAS A RENTER WHO AND IT MOVED ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY GET SOME- THEY SEE SOME ADVERTISING ON TV FOR A CANDIDATE BUT THEY REALIZE THEY'RE BARRED. FROM PARTICIPATING BECAUSE OF THE THIRTY DAYS WE WERE ABLE TO GET GOVERNOR DAVIS AT THE TIME TO MAKE IT UP. FIFTEEN DAYS AND NOW UNDER LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES WE HAVE SAME DAY REGISTRATION ALL OF WHICH TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS US. TO VALIDATE. AND SO. THERE'S NOTHING MORE SACRED IS WERE DEBATING THESE ISSUES NOW CROSS THIS COUNTRY THEN THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE. AND TECHNOLOGY HAS FUNDAMENTALLY ARM IMPROVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE SURE IN THAT BALANCE THAT THE GREATEST NUMBER OF HUMAN BEINGS WERE ELIGIBLE FOR NOT SYSTEMICALLY BARRED FROM THE SYSTEM WHICH HAS HAPPENED TO US SO MUCH OF OUR HISTORY. IN THE UNITED STATES AND CALIFORNIA SO I MAKE THESTATEMENT AND APOLOGIZE W. QUESTION I JUST THINK I WANT TO PUT THIS ON THE RECORD AND SOME MORE HISTORICAL CONTEXT BECAUSE- YOU KNOW WHEN pI WAS. IN GOVERNMENT WHEN. WHEN WE HAD THE- ISSUE IN FLORIDA WITHOUT GORE TO FIND OUT THAT MACHINES THAT WE HAD. IN CALIFORNIA. 53% OF THOSE MACHINES HAD HANGING CHADS WHICH WERE IN SO WE DID A BOND MEASURE TO GET ELIMINATE THOSE MACHINES TO AVOID ANY QUESTION AGAIN. ABOUT THE INTEGRITY OF THE ELECTIONS. SO THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE TO A NUMBER OF THE VARIOUS ADVOCACY GROUPS HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH FOR MANY MANY YEARS. CARE DEEPLY ABOUT IT AND WOULD CERTAINLY LIKE. TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR ON THIS MEASURE IF THAT WOULD BE OKAY WITH YOU- TERM- BURKE- I CERTAINLY AM GOING TO SUPPORT THIS AND I JUST WANTED TO GIVE SOME GREATER HISTORICAL CONTEXT. AS WE DEBATE THIS CRITICAL CRITICAL ISSUE TO ENSURE THAT THE GREATEST NUMBER OF PEOPLE. ARE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE AND THAT WE HAVE THE SAFEGUARDS NOW TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS SO I CERTAINLY WOULD SUPPORT YOUR MESURE AND THANK YOU FOR INDULGING ME ON THAT TIME- AND ALLOWING TO EXPRESS MY THINKING ON THIS. THANK YOU CENTER HERTZBERG CENTER NIELSEN. YES THURMOND. I AM SPEAKING TO SEPARATE TO LODGE OBJECTIONS. TO THE WAY SENATE IS CON CONDUCTING ITS BUSINESS THESE DAYS. I WANTED FORMALLY ACKNOWLEDGE EVEN AND COMMITTEES NOW FOR YEARS WE HAVE BEEN ALLOWING A PRESENTER. AND THEN INDIVIDUALS SOMETIMES A THREE WHICH VARIEDFROM TIME TO TIME COMMITTEE BY COMMITTEE BUT THREE PEOPLE TO MORE EXPANSIVELY TESTIFY AND EVERYBODY ELSE GETS TO COME UP AND SAY THEIR NAMES AND WIFE. I DO NOT CONSIDER THAT PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN THIS GOT NO REFERENCE TO THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL BECAUSE I HAVE THE HIGHEST RESPECT. FOR THIS AUTHOR. IT'S A GENERAL OBSERVATION. BAG RELATED INCREDIBLY FOR ME LAST MONDAY WHEN THE SENATE CHANGED ITS RULES. OF SENATORS REPRESENTING ONE MILLION PEOPLE ARE NOW STARTING. FROM PRESENTING THEIR OPINIONS IN THE STATE SENATE. WITH THAT DEGREE JUST AFTER THAT THE HAS BEEN TAKEN HERE IN THE SENATE I'M NOW GOING TO BE OBJECTING EVEN IN OUR COMMITTEE HEARINGS. TWO STIFLING THE PUBLIC INPUT. HOW FRUSTRATING IT'S GOT TO BE FOR THE AVERAGE CITIZEN WANTS TO HAVE THEIR VOICE HEARD IN GOVERNMENT. AND THEY GET TO SAY I'M JONES AND I LIKE OR DISLIKE. THAT'S THE EXTENT OF THE COMMUNICATION THAT THEY'RE PROVIDED. IN THE OPEN SEVEN. AND FOR MEMBERS REPRESENTING ONE MILLION PEOPLE TO HAVE THEIR VOICES STIFLED BY SILLY RULES LIKE THE ONES WE PASSED MONDAY. I'M PRETTY IRRITATED ABOUT THIS GERMAN AND THAT'S WHY I FORMALLY WANT MINE OCT OPPOSITION AND OBJECTION. EVENED TO THE PROCEDURE HERE TODAY. AND I CERTAINLY CANNOT SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON SENATOR. NEWMAN I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY- THE FIRST WITNESS WAS ADMINISTERED THEY'LL TAKE A LOWER FROM THE ORANGE COUNTY TREASURE'S OFFICE I WANT TO COMMEND. A MISTAKE LOW AND ALL HER STAFF AND IN FACT THE STATUS OF ALL THE REGISTRATION MY DISTRICT WHICH THREE COUNTY SAN MARINO LOS ANGELES COUNTY AS WELL. TO SOME OF THE POINTS OF THE OBSERVED TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE SIGNATURE MATCHING. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF OTHER VERY THOROUGH CHECKS- IN THIS ELECTION WAS BY ALL INDICATIONS THE FAIREST AND MOST ACCURATE ELECTION IN SOME TIME IT CAME WITH THE ADDED BONUS OF PROVIDING ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE. WE SHOULD OF COURSE CONTINUE TO IMPROVE AND PROTECT THE ELECTIONS PROCESS I THINK WE'RE DOING THAT PROGRESSIVELY THAT THE GOALS OF THIS BILL DO NOT IMPINGE UPON THAT IN FACT THAT THEY GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT WHILE OFFERING. AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A VERY CHALLENGING TIME THIS PANDEMIC WILL BE WITH US FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT- THAT OUR ELECTION PROCESSES DO NOT SUFFER CHAU THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR- AND I WOULD ALSO BE HONORED TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR OF THE BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR NEWMAN CENTER LEYVA THANK YOU MISTERCHAIR GOOD MORNING- I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL AS WELL TODAY AND YOU KNOW I THINK TAT WE SHOULD ALWAYS STRIVE TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR TO VOTE ISN'T THAT WHAT THE CONSTITUTION WANTS HIS PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO VOTE AND LET THEIR VOICE BE HEARD. AND WHAT BETTER WAY TO LET YOUR VOICE BE HEARD THAT HAVING ACCESS TO VOTING WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ISN'T VOTER FRAUD WE KNOW THAT THAT DID NOT HAPPEN- IN TE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MAYBE ONE OR TWO BUT CERTAINLY NOT WIDESPREAD VOTER FRAUD. I HAPPEN uTHINK PROCEDURE ALLOWS MORE PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE AS A GOOD SENATOR FROM TO HEYMAN NOTED PEOPLE USED TO HAVE TO COME UP TO SACRAMENTO STAND IN A LINE OVER HERE AND JUST SAY. THEIR NAME AND WHETHER THEY SUPPORT OR OPPOSE NOW HE CAN CALL IN TO DO IT FROM COMFORT OF THEIR OWN. AND I HOPE THAT WE ONTINUE DO THAT EVEN ONCE A PANDEMIC IS OVER. SO I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE AND HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER LEYVA- AT THE MEDIA OFFER A FEW A FEW OBSERVATIONS FIRST- IN REGARD TO OUR PROCESS AND PROCEDURES. I WOULD TO ECHO THE- THE WISDOM FROM A SET OF THE SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES THAT. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY NOT ALLOWED PEOPLE TO- TESTIFIED VIA PHONE LINES AND- I THINK IT'S BEEN AN EXTRAORDINARY- EXTENSION OF OUR DESIRE TO HAVE INPUT FROM OUR CITIZENRY THAT WE'VE NOW- IN THIS PANDEMIC CIRCUMSTANCE- PROVIDED FOR THAT AND- ALL THE PEOPLE THAT. TESTIFIED VIA PHONE TODAY I CERTAINLY DIDN'T HAVE THE COST AND INCONVENIENCE OF ALL THE TRAVEL SO THAT WE pCOURSE OF OUR DELIBERATIONS SO- IT'S NOT PERFECT BUT I CERTAINLY THINK THAT THE SENATE IS SAID TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING IT CAN TO- RES. IMPORT AND TESTIMONY IN OUR IN OUR WORK. BUT LET ME I GO TO THE BILL THAT AT HAND I WANT TO- ECHO SOME OF THE COMMENTS FROM THE SENATOR FROM LA THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY IN REGARD TO THE HISTORY OF EFFORTS TO EXPAND VOTING. OPPORTUNITIES AYE AYE YOU MAY NOT RECALL SENATOR HERTZBERG IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WHEN I AS WORKING FOR THE GOVERNOR- THAT WE MADE AN EFFORT IN OUR LEGISLATION- IN OUR FIRST YEAR TO TRY TO- IN A SPECIAL ELECTION THAT WAS ANTICIPATED. IN THAT YEAR TO HAVE AS A COMPONENT OF IT AND ALL MAIL ELECTION AND WE WENT TO AND DO A CONSIDERABLE- RESEARCH IN TERMS OF THOSE PROGRAMS HAPPENING AROUND THE COUNTRY AND WHAT HAS BEEN WORKING WHAT HAD BEEN NOT- SO I CERTAINLY THINK WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A PROCESS THAT WORKS. AND I JOIN WITH MY COLLEAGUES- IN COMMENDING AND CONGRATULATING THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND OUR REGISTRARS FROM AROUND THE STATE WHO DID SUCH A MARVELOUS JOB IN THIS ELECTION SEASON I TO GET THE BALLOTS OUT TO SO MANY AND HAVE THIS GREAT LEVEL OF PARTICIPATION IT REALLY IS A- A GREAT HALLMARK OF THEIR SERVICE. AND I KNOW THAT THE SENATE. YOUR EFFORTS ARE TO CONTINUE THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT IN THIS. YEAR THAT WE'RE IN NOW TWENTY TWENTY ONE- THAT WE DON'T HAVE A PLACE THAT SAME A PROCESS THAT IS A HEALTHY ONE FOR INCLUDING AN INCREASING- TURNED OUT I THINK THAT. THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO DO THAT AT THIS YEAR AS WE- AGAIN TRY TO LEARN FROM THE PROCESS SEE WERE WE- CAN DO IT BETTER. I DO NOTE THAT THE THAT THERE WAS SOME TESTIMONY ABOUT SOME ISSUES THERE ARE ALWAYS ISSUES- BUT NONE OF IT. NONE OF THEM- WITH ANY AT THAT SIZE OR ANY- IMPACT ON ANY OF THE RACES IN THE STATE WE CAN ALWAYS LOOK FOR WAYS TO DO BETTER. I WOULD INVITE THIS MOCK REPRESENTING THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE TO. TAKE THOSE CONCERNS TO HEART AND I WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO AN OPPORTUNITY. TO VISIT WITH THAT THAT OFFICE- TO WHAT TO REVIEW THOSE ISSUES SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO LOOK OR WAYS. TO DO IT BETTER I WANNA INVITE THE AUTHOR CENTER I'M BURKE TO MAKE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS BEFORE WE- WE WELCOME IN THE OCEAN. WELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. LET ME ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS FROM SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES VERY ELOQUENTLY STATED IN TERMS OF THE- A- CENTER. OLD ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO EITHER THE EXPANSION OF THE CONTRACTION. OF FRANCHISE THIS BILL CLEARLY. STANDS ON THE SIDE OF INCREASING FRANCHISE TO THOSE WHO ARE.
