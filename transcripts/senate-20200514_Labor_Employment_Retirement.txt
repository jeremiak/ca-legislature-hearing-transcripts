EIGHT ZERO SIX THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. SO GOOD AT. A MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND APRIL OF TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT ISSUED A DECISION IN A CASE THAT CHANGE THE WORK LIFE OF MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS. DEPARTING FROM THIRTY YEARS OF CALIFORNIA LAW THE DYNAMICS DECISION CREATED A NEW TEST TO DETERMINE WHO IS AND WHO ISN'T AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. IN THIS NEW MOST WRIST IN THIS ONE OF THE MOST RESTRICTIVE RULES OF ANY EMPLOYMENT TEST RELATING TO WAGE AND HOUR. LAWS IT'S ONE OF THE MOST RESTRICTIVE IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY LAST YEAR THIS COMMITTEE PASSED IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED AB FIVE WHICH CODIFIED THE DYNAMICS DECISION INTO LAW. FOR PICKING AND CHOOSING WHICH INDUSTRIES. WOULD BE ABLE TO CONTINUE WORK. CONTRACTORS IN WHICH WOULD NOT. LET'S NOT FORGET MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO CHOOSE TO WORK AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS THROUGH THE SINGLE MOMS TO USE A NEW BRAT TO DRIVE WHILE THEIR KIDS ARE AT SCHOOL. THE COLLEGE STUDENT WHO WORKS AFTER CLASS TO AFFORD THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING IN THE STATE. A HAIRSTYLIST WHO WANTS TO SET THEIR OWN APPOINTMENTS RENT THEIR BOOTS AND SHOES TO WORK AS THEIR OWN BOSS. THERE ARE DOCTORS ARE INSURANCE AGENTS ENGINEERS SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS THERAPISTS TRUCK DRIVERS HAVE BEEN DRIVING AROUND THIS CAPITAL TODAY IN PROTEST. STUDENT ASSISTANCE SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETERS ARTIST THEM. OUR KIDS REFEREES ON SATURDAYS WILL BE USED TO BE ABLE TO GO WATCH OUR KIDS GAMES. HOWEVER BECAUSE OF AB FIVE OF THESE INDUSTRIES ARE NO LONGER ALLOWED TO HAVE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IN CALIFORNIA. A ONE SIZE FITS ALL EMPLOYMENT TEST SHOULD NOT AND CANNOT APPLY. TO KEEP POURING INTO DEPEND ON THIS VERY TYPE THE INCOME TAX ABILITY. FOR QUALITY BY PROVIDED BY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR WORK. THIS IS WHAT CAN ON THIS ISSUE THE LAST TWO YEARS INVITING FOR ALL. TO BE TREATED IN THE SAME UNDER THE EYES OF THE LAW. SENATE BILL EIGHT SB EIGHT OH SIX. WOULD REPEAL AB FIVE IN THERE BY THE FIRST THE DEVASTATING IMPACTS THE DYNAMICS IS CODIFIED IN BY AB FIVE. AND HAD ON THE JOBS IN THE JOB CREATION OF FREELANCERS ON IN OUR ECONOMY. MY BILL IS EVEN MORE NECESSARY NOW WILL BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT CODE NINETEEN CRISIS. THE GOVERNOR STAY AT HOME ORDER OVER FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS HAVE APPLIED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. THE ONE THING THAT THIS CRISIS MADE CLEAR IS THE WORK FORCE NEEDS FLEXIBILITY NOW MORE THAN EVER. THE MORE THE TRADITIONAL MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY NINE TO FIVE WORK MODEL DOES NOT WORK FOR COUNTLESS MOMS AND DADS THAT CURRENTLY HAVE CHILDREN OUT OF SCHOOL AND ACCESS TO CHILDCARE. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS SUCH AS DOOR DASH INTO THE CART SINGLE OWNER OPERATOR TRUCK DRIVERS IN SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETERS HAVE LOST THEIR INCOME AND THEIR ABILITY TO FEED THEIR FAMILY. DUE TO AB FIVE IN THIS CRISIS. YET THERE ARE SOME THE MOST ESSENTIAL EMPLOYEES IN THE VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS THAT WE NEED RIGHT NOW. SB EIGHT OH SIX AN EMERGENCY MEASURE IS INTENDED TO ADDRESS THESE NEEDS BY ALLOWING FOR THE ACTING THE FLEXIBILITY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTING MODEL. SB EIGHT OH SIX WOULD REPEAL AB FIVE AND REPLACE IT WITH A NEW BROAD FLEXIBLE. AND WORKABLE ABC TEST FOR DETERMINING INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR STATUS. THE TEST WHICH SUPPORTS WORKER FREEDOM OF SAVING BUSINESS TO BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP OPPORTUNITIES. UNLIKE AB FIVE STRICT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO MEET A. B. C. TEST WHICH REVOKES FREELANCING OPPORTUNITIES IN THE ABILITY TO EARN A LIVING FOR MILLIONS OF FREELANCERS. NEW AB T. TECH AN S. PIERCE WITH SIGNIFICANT EXPAND INTO CAN. ALLOWING FREELANCERS TO CONTINUE TO WORK AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AS LONG AS THEY COMPLY WITH THE SIMPLE EASIER TO MEET A. B. C. TEST. SB EIGHT OH SIX WILL ALLOW ALL HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS THAT CHOOSE THIS TYPE OF WORK TO BE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AGAIN. AS SUCH THEY WILL NO LONGER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT TAKING AWAY THEIR FREEDOM AND-FLEXIBILITY BY FORCING THEM TO BECOME EMPLOYEES. I KNOW THE OPPOSITION IS GONNA SAY THAT WITHOUT AB FIVE BUSINESSES CAN NO LONGER USE MISCLASSIFIED WORKERS AND DENIED THEM BASICALLY PER RIGHTS OR THAT MY BILL WILL MOVE CALIFORNIA BACKWARDS. TOO CONFUSING STANDARD NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH. SB EIGHT OH SIX IS A COMMONSENSE RESPONSE THE DYNAMICS DECISION AND EIGHTY FIVE OUR BILL WILL PROTECT THE LIVELIHOOD OF MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS. WHO CHOOSE TO WORK AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IN HIS LIFE AND HIS LIKELY WHOSE WERE PUT TO. TO PUT IT WERE PUT AT RISK BECAUSE OF THE COURT'S DECISION IN THE LAW. THAT'S WHY SB ZERO SIX IS IMPORTANT AND WHY MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE OF OPINION. ABOUT THE DYNAMIC DECISION AND AB FIVE MY NIPPLE NOT CREATE CONFUSION OR CARVE OUTS. BUT RATHER PROVIDE CLARITY TO THE ROUGHLY ONE MILLION INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AFFECTED BY EIGHT FIVE JUST WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK THEIR OWN HOURS. ON THEIR OWN TIME. CALIFORNIA BILLY IS THE LAND OF OPPORTUNITY THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO PROTECT WORKERS RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS TO ENSURE THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE WHERE THEY WORK. WHERE THEY WORK. WHAT THE WORK ON HOW MUCH THEY EARN ESPECIALLY NOW DURING THIS PANDEMIC LET'S HELP CALIFORNIANS GET BACK TO WORK.

THAT ARE IN SUPPORT OF SB EIGHT OH SIX AND THANK YOU FOR PARTICIPATING WITH US TODAY WE WILL NOW MOVE TO- THOSE WHO ARE WANT TO TESTIFY IN. OPPOSITION CENTERS ANY PUBLIC COMMENT HERE IN ROOM FORTY TWO OH THREE IN OPPOSITION GOOD AFTERNOON. AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SERAPH LOCKS FROM THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WE ARE HERE IN OPPOSITION. AND I JUST WANT TO START BY SAYING. ONE THING THAT THIS PANDEMIC HAS LAID BARE IS THE DAMAGE THAT MS CLASSIFICATION HAS DONE TO OUR ECONOMY. AND DONE TO OUR SOCIAL SAFETY NET. MS CLASSIFIED WORKERS AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS ARE ON THE FRONT LINES THEY'RE DELIVERING FOOD DAY ARE IN OUR HOSPITALS THEIR TRUCKERS THEIR JANITORS THAT ARE CLEANING OUT CLEANING UP AFTER US. AND THEY ARE DOING IT WITHOUT THE BENEFITS OF THE RIGHT TO PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT TO WORKERS COMP TO ANY PD PAID LEAVE IF THEY GET SICK OR HEALTH BENEFITS. AND THIS IS NOT JUST A PROBLEM FOR WORKERS ARE INDIVIDUAL WORKERS WHAT WE HAVE SEEN DURING THE ECONOMIC CRISIS IS THAT COMPANIES THAT ARE ALLOWED TO MISS CLASSIFYING WHO CAN USE A CAN. FOURTEEN PART TEST ARE THE ONES WHO ARE SHIP SHIFTING THE COST OF THIS ECONOMIC CRISIS ON TO RESPONSIBLE EMPLOYERS AND ON TO TAXPAYERS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT CAME OUT TODAY SAID THAT OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS WE'RE GONNA BE PAYING OUT FORTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN U. I. BENEFITS TO WORKERS SIX HUNDRED AND 50% MORE THAN WAS. THAT IS GOING TO FALL ON RESPONSIBLE EMPLOYERS WHO'VE BEEN EMPLOYING PEOPLE AND PAYING INTO THAT FUND. THINGS HAVE GOTTEN SO BAD THAT FOR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS HAD TO COME IN AND BAIL US OUT WITH THE P. WAY THAT IS MONEY THAT TAXPAYERS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE. AB FIVE WAS A WAY TO TRY TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE THAT HAD BEEN DONE BOTH TO THE ECONOMY BUT ALSO TO OUR SOCIAL SAFETY NET TO OUR SOCIAL INSURANCE WHICH MEANS. COLLECTIVELY WE ARE THERE FOR TO CARE FOR WORKERS DURING AN EMERGENCY ALL OF US AND NOT THE UBERS AND LEFT WHO- FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS INTO THE U. I FIND WE'RE GOING TO BE ON THE HOOK. FOR PAYING FOR THAT LOAN THAT WE'RE GETTING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO BAIL US OUT. AND SO AB FIVE WAS A WAY TO REPAIR SOME OF THAT DAMAGE BUT ALSO ALLOW FOR. EXEMPTIONS AND FOR COMMON SENSE WAYS FOR THERE TO BE SOME POPLE TO GO TO BACK TO THE BROWN- TEST. AND TO THE PEOPLE ON THE LINE WHO ARE FREELANCERS AND JOURNALISTS AND MUSICIANS. THE AUTHOR OF AB FIVE IS STILL WORKING ON TWEAKS AND FIXES AS THE BILL IS IMPLEMENTED IN AB EIGHTEEN FIFTY AND TWENTY TWO FIFTY SEVEN IS ONE OF THE WAYS TO DO THAT. SO WE THINK THAT EIGHTY FIVE IS STILL A SMART BILL STILL HERE TO PROTECT WORKERS AND THE ECONOMY AND TAXPAYERS- BEYOND THAT THERE ARE. BILLS MOVING FORWARD TO HELP FIX IT AND SO WE WOULD URGE YOUR NO VOTE ON SB EIGHT OH SIX THANK YOU VERY MUCH REFLECT ARE THERE ANY MEMBERS OF THE- IN. ELSE IT THE- IN.

AND THANK YOU TO ALL OF OUR SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION WITNESSES WILL NOT BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO MEMBERS THIS SENATOR JACKSON'S. THIS ITEM WANT TO THANK ALL THE PEOPLE WHO TESTIFIED BOTH IN SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION AND I'D I DO APPRECIATE WHAT THE GOAL IS- IN THIS BILL TO. TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE INDEED SOME LEGITIMATE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS OUT THERE IT HERE'S THE PROBLEM HOWEVER. OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST DECADE OR TWO WERE PROBABLY THREE WE HAVE SEEN THE DEFINITION OF INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR GROW AND GROW AND GROW TO THE POINT WHERE. PEOPLE REALLY ARE NOT INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WHAT IT IS THAT EMPLOYERS DON'T WANT TO PROMOTE- ABIDE BY THE VARIOUS LAWS HIM PROTECTIONS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE FOR WORKERS WE PASS A NUMBER OF THESE BILLS HERE. IN THE LEGISLATURE TO PROTECT AGAINST DISCRIMINATION TO PROTECT AGAINST WAGE STAFF TO PROTECT ALL SORTS OF RIGHTS THAT WORKERS WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE SO. WHEN PEOPLE SAY- THEY'VE LOST THEIR JOBS- THAT ISN'T ACTUALLY CORRECT I DO NOT BELIEVE WHAT I DO THINK IT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM. IS THAT EMPLOYERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO HIRE THEY JUST DON'T WANT TO THEY DON'T WANT TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF A REAL EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP. THAT BEING SAID THERE ARE SOME SITUATIONS MUSICIANS AS AN EXAMPLE- I KNOW A NUMBER OF FREELANCE MUSICIAN SO I KNOW A NUMBER OF FREELANCE WRITERS- I KNOW A NUMBER OF PEOPLE- INTERPRETERS. WHO HAVE LEGITIMATELY HAVE THEIR OWN BUSINESSES THE PROBLEM IS HOW DO WE DISTINGUISH AND I WOULD STAY I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE ANSWER. I DO HOPE THAT WOULD TO THAT SOLUTION BUT I DO BELIEVE THE WATERS HAPPENED IN TODAY'S WORLD IS THE PENDULUM HAS SWUNG TOO FAR OVER. INTO THE INDEPENDENT OCEAN EVERYBODY IS IN IT PANIC CONTRA. AND ALSO THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A BIGGER ARMY THEY HAVE THE BENEFIT IN THE RIGHT IN THE. SO I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE FRUSTRATIONS A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE WHO FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS HAVE THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS HAVE BEEN ABLE BECAUSE HIM BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T ENFORCED. THE LAWS OF EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP AND THAT NOW THAT THERE IS THIS A COURT DECISION WHICH AB FIVE IS ESSENTIALLY RESPONDING TO- PEOPLE WHO. THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE INDEPENDENT DIDN'T HAVE ANY- REGULATORY IF YOU WILL- ENTITLEMENTS- PAID LEAVE FOR EXAMPLE ALL THE THINGS THAT MANY OF US HAVE BEEN WORKING ON TO PROTECT EMPLOYEES IN THE STATE. ARE NOW BEING TOLD BY EMPLOYERS- WE CAN'T HIRE YOU BUT THAT ISN'T TRUE. THE POOR THE POINT IS THAT EMPLOYERS DON'T WANT TO HIRE THEM THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO ABIDE BY THESE REGULATIONS SO SOMEWHERE THERE'S A HAPPY MEDIUM. I DON'T THINK THIS IS YET BUT I. BRING IN BILL AND I APPRECIATE THE FIRST PEOPLE DISCOUNT WAY THEY'LL THE LAW THE PART THAT THEY HAD THE ABILITY TO YOU KNOW TO DECIDE TO CHANGE. WHEN THEY WORK BUT BUT THE FACT IS THEY HAD DON'T. WOMEN ENACT SOME THAT I MANY OF UP T HAVE BEEN WORKING ON PROTECTIONS IN THE WORLD PLACE WORKING ON OF THE- OF. TO KNOW WHEN THEY GO TO WORK THE GOING TO BE PER BY PETE THAT NO THE- IF THERE ARE OFFER THEY GET SICK ON THE JOB THEY HAVE THE TO. APPLY FOR ON A THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO FROM COMP. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS DON'T HAVE THOSE RIGHTS AND THAT IS PART OF THE ROB PETER SO- IT'S MY HOPE THAT AS WE CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION WE CAN FIND THAT SWEET ART. PRINT IN MORE RISK PROTECT. THESE ARE AT THIS MAKE AND TING EMPLOYER HIRE PEOPLE WHICH HAVE. EVERY OF TO DO AND AT THE SAME TIME TRUE ARE IN CAR. THE WAY THE DEAF WORK. PUBLIC FIFTEEN YOU OKAY A BEFORE EXPORT CHINS. OPENING OUT WE CAN GET TO THAT TO THE POINT SO. ALONG AROUND SAYING THANK YOU FOR. YOUR EFFORTS I DON'T AGREE WITH IT BUT THERE IS A PLACE WE TO GO TO BE A TO WOULD NOT. THE WHO ARE INDEED TRULY A- CONTRACTORS SAY SENATOR VICE MORALE THANK. SENATOR HILL. SENATOR GROWTH ONE ONE THERE WAS THIS THAT I'VE HEARD YEARS AGO OP FOR ALL IN FAVORITISM TOWARDS AND SO I AT COURSE WAS NOT FAN OF A FIVE IT IT'S CA CON TO THAT SAME AT AND IT DOES WINNERS AND LOSERS BUT WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT ISN'T SO MUCH WHAT WE THINK- I KNOW THE CALLS AND GET IN AND MIGHT IN MY DISTRICT FROM CONSTITUENTS AND I DON'T MEAN EMPLOYERS BUT PEOPLE IN A GET A CONDOM IT BURNS COMPLAIN I'M JUST WONDERING- FROM YOUR DISTRICT- NOT THE EMPLOYERS BUT- PEOPLE THE ACTUAL IN THE PAST CONTRACTORS DO YOU HEAR. WHAT DO YOU IN YOUR NOW OF THE WOODS BUT NOT JUST THAT YOU GET A THE STATE NOW YOU'RE. LEAVE OF OUR CAUCUS. CAN SHARE SOME OF THE- CITY. ABSOLUTELY I THINK YOU M. SIR SO IN MY DISTRICT TIMES JUST LIKE ALL OF YOUR ARE INDEED WHO BE THAT THERE ARE HAS BEEN DISRUPTED BY AB FIVE AND THE DYNAMICS DECISION WAS A HEARING OR A BILL THAT PASSED- SKEWS ME A LAW THAT PASSED. BUT WE CODIFIED THAT THIS LEGISLATURE CODIFIED THAT THAT DECISION TO LOG BUT IT ALSO CREATED CONFUSION BECAUSE IT WASN'T DIRECTLY WHAT THE DYNAMICS DECISION WAS. IT CARVED OUT CERTAIN INDUSTRIES SO EVEN THOUGH THE LAW PASSED WHICH SHOWS HOW BAD THAT LAW IS IN THE FIRST PLACE AB FIVE MEANING EVEN THOUGH THE SUPREME COURT MADE A DECISION THAT SAYS THE CLASSIFIEDS INDETERMINATE CONTRACTORS A CERTAIN WAY THEY WERE ALL UNDER THAT SAME RULE AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN AB FIVE COMES ALONG AND CHANGES IT. THEY EXCLUDE PEOPLE SO IF YOU WERE ABLE TO CARVE OUT OF THAT BILL YOU NO LONGER HAVE TO REAP COMPLY WITH THE LAW THAT THE COURT PASSED SO YOU HAVE A LAW THAT COOPER PASS WHICH THE PEOPLE THAT ARE STILL INSIDE THE BILL LIKE OR SOMEONE ORDERS THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA MENTIONED ABOUT. YOU KNOW INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE TRULY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. IN THE- THAT ARE TRULY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. LIKE SALON OWNERS AND WE LOOK AT YOU KNOW THERE PROTECTIONS IN PP WILL THE REGULATED BY THE CARS COSMETOLOGY AND BARBER INDUSTRY. AND THEY HAVE SOME OF THE STRICTEST SANITATION REQUIREMENTS EVER. AND EVEN GOING BACK WITH THIS CALL THE NINETEEN SING HOPEFULLY BUT AND LATER STAGE TWO OR STAGE THREE WHERE THEY GET TO BE ABLE TO BE OPEN AGAIN. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE EVEN MORE STRICTER REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO PROTECT IN HAVE PP. THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE READY WILLING AND ABLE TO DO THAT THEY BRING US PLANS ALL THE TIME YOU KNOW THIS IS WHAT WE CAN PUT IN PLACE. AND NOT ONLY THAT WE HAD ALL THOSE PEOPLE ON THE PHONE AND I'VE BEEN GETTING MY PHONE CALLS AND STAFF SAYS THE PHONE'S BEEN BLOWING UP IN THE OFFICE. BECAUSE THEY WERE PEOPLE THAT WEREN'T ABLE TO GET THROUGH AND SOME PEOPLE WAITED AN HOUR AND A HALF ONLINE. AND WE ALSO COLLECTED ONLINE THIRTEEN HUNDRED AND SOMEWHAT SIGNATURES THAT WE BROUGHT. IN IN IN THE RECENT DAYS WHICH IS NOT IN THE ANALYSIS WE HAD OVER THIRTY FIVE INDUSTRIES. AND CHAMBER PARTICIPANTS THAT CAME ON BOARD TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. SO JUST TO BE CLEAR. M. WHEN THE DAY. TO SIT PASSED THAT WAS A- RULING. IT WAS A COURT RULING. AND THAT WAS FOR. EVERY INDUSTRY WOULD BE PARTICULAR IT INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. BUT THEN WE CAME ALONG OR THE AUTHOR CAME ALONG OF AB FIVE AND- SHE SEPARATED OUT. INDUSTRIES SO NOW YOU'RE EITHER. COMPLYING WITH THE LAW THAT THE COURT PASSED. OR YOUR CUP STILL IN THE BILL. AND YOU HAVE TO YOUR CALL IF YOU'RE IN THE BILL YOU'RE COMPLYING WITH THE LAW THAT. WAS PASSED. IF YOU'RE OUT OF THE BILL AND WE WILL BE CARVED OUT OF THE BILL. THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW. THIS JUST THIS BILL JUST SETS AN EVEN PLAYING FIELD SO THAT EVERYBODY'S ON THE SAME PAGE IN EVERYBODY COMPLIES WITH THE SAME LAW. INDEED THE TEST. IN THE I'M IN THE AB FIVE TEST. WITH THE A. B. C. TIENEN. SOUND A LITTLE. BUT THOSE THREE PROGRAM. ARE PARAMETERS THAT ARE ALL. AND TO MEET. SO LET'S JUST TAKE THE BE PRIME BECAUSE THAT'S THE MOST DIFFICULT TO COMPLY WITH. IT SAYS THAT YOU HAVE TO COMPLY WITH ALL THREE THERE'S NO EITHER OR NOW MY BILL IS AN EITHER OR- YOU COMPLY WITH. A OR B. AND C. OR YOU CAN AS LONG AS YOU COMPLY WITH AT LEAST ONE TWO OF THE- TWO OF THEM WERE IN THERE. SO PRIME BE. THE THIS IS THE UNDER A. B. I. FIVE BILL THE PERSON PERFORMS WORK OUTSIDE THE USUAL COURSE OF THE HIRING AUTHORITIES- BUSINESS. SO IF YOU'RE A SALON OWNER AND YOU A FULL. EMPLOYEE ARE IN PEOPLE THAT WORK IN YOUR BUSINESS OUR HAIR DRESSERS. THEY CAN NEVER BE AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR BECAUSE THEY'RE IN THE SAME INDUSTRY. IF THAT MAKES SENSE. SO WE'RE JUST TRYING TO FIX IT AND MAKE IT AN EVEN PLAYING FIELD AND THAT'S ALL THIS BILL DOES. IT DOESN'T ALLOW PEOPLE TO BE CARVED OUT AND IT DOESN'T IT LOOKS EVERYBODY'S UNDER THE SAME IN AND OF THE SAME- RULE OF LAW. I GUESS. IS THE BEST WAY TO EXPLAIN IT AND I WANNA THANK EVERYBODY WHO CALLED IN AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. AND THANK YOU FOR THE LATEST US SUPPORT THAT WE RECEIVED IN THE STILL FOR MANY INDUSTRIES AND A LOT OF INDIVIDUALSAROUND. STATE THAT ARE. VERY UPSET WE NEVER THOUGHT IN A MILLION YEARS THAT. INDIVIDUALS IN THE- MOVING IN AND- YOU'RE THE- OWNER TO. INDUSTRY WITH. WITH REPUBLIC CAUCUS THEY HAVE. OVER THE LAST SEVEN. IN THE- BOMBING SUPPORT HIS TERM. BECAUSE THEY REALLY LIKE THEY'VE BEEN. ROBBED OF THEIR WEIGHT MAKE A LIVING. AND WE SHOULD NOT EVEN WE SHOULD NOT. IF TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FOR. DURING THIS IS THE WORK ON. TODAY.

UP AND UP CERTAINLY THE ARE IN WERE IN CON ARE ORDER AND APPROPRIATE THERE ARE THOSE THAT HEAD AND MANY MISS CLASSIFICATIONS AND ABUSES THAT SHOULD BE CHANGED SO I. I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR- COMMITMENT TO THAT CHANGE I JUST DON'T THINK THIS IS THE WAY TO DO IT BECAUSE WE'RE GOING BACK IN AS WE SAW WITH CARRILLO IT- JUST THE COURTS MADE THIS. ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS AND THAT WAS DIFFICULT SO I CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL BUT I CERTAINLY WOULD HOPE YOU WOULD CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION WITH US AND WITH OUR COMMITTEE. AND STAFF SO THAT WE COULD PERHAPS- WORK THROUGH SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THAT SO WITH THAT. I WILL ENTERTAIN A MOTION. I'D LIKE TO TELL. WHO'S SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE BILL BEEN MOVED BY. MORE THE MOTION IS TO PASS APPROACH SO. PLEASE THE ROLL. OUR PLEASE TURN ON YOUR MY- TO CAST VOTE. CENTER NO. AND HELL NO. CENTER MARIE I GENERAL HI CENTER JACK'S NO CENTER JACKSON NO CENTER MITCHELL NOW CENTER MID NO CENTER PAN NO AND PAN NO. THE BILL HAS A ONE I AND FOR KNOWS IF. THANK YOU CENTER GROWTH COULD WE GET RID CONSIDERING FOR RECONSIDER GRANT DOUBLE YES WE WILL GRANT RECONSIDERS WITHOUT A THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. SO THE HONORED IS SB EIGHT THREE SENATOR KIRBY I. WHICH IS. WELCOME SENATOR CARRIER THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR. YOU REPRESENT THE SB EIGHT NINETY THREE THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S MY PLEASURE TO PRESENT SB EIGHT NINETY THREE A BILL THAT WOULD GRANT A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION PURPOSES TO HEALTH CARE WORKERS TO PROVIDE DIRECT PATIENT CARE IN ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS FOR INJURIES INCLUDING MUSCO SKELETAL INJURIES INFECTIOUS AND RESPIRATORY DISEASES INCLUDING NOVEL PATH THAT YOU AND SUCH AS KOBE NINETEEN. LAST YEAR IN THIS COMMITTEE ARE PRESENTED A SIMILAR BILL TO GRANT PRESUMPTIONS FOR A BROADER SET OF INJURIES INCLUDING CANCER IN PTSD IN ADDITION TO THOSE IN CURRENTLY INCLUDED IN THIS BILL DUE TO YOUR CONCERNS. AND AFTER MANY STATIONS I NEVER THE BILL TO COVER TIONS THAT NURSES HAVE EXPERIENCED IN OUR HOSPITALS WITHIN ADEQUATE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT PROMPTED ME TO INCLUDE NOVEL PATHOGENS IN THIS BILL MANY OF YOU HAVE SEEN THE STORIES OF NURSES HAVING TO RE USE THEIR PP OR IN THE WORST OF CASES WORK WITH NO NINE PUTTING THEIR LIVES AND THAT OF THEIR FAMILIES A GREAT RISK. MY INTENT IS TO PROVIDE THE PRESUMPTION OF A PASSAGE WHEN WE IN THAT WHEN WE AND OTHER SUCH LIKE THE ONE WE ARE LIVING THROUGH TODAY. I DO NOT INTENDED TO INCLUDE A PRESUMPTION FOR THE REGULAR FLU AND I'M HAPPY TO THAT MISSION OFFER NOVEL PATHOGEN ACCORDING TO LOT WHICH IS A TITLE THE CALIPER COULD REGULATE. EXCLUDE ORIENTS OF THE HUMAN EMPLOYMENT VIRUS THAT OCCUR FOR. NOT COVERAGE FOR A SYMPTOMATIC COVERT NINETEEN WORKERS I'M HAPPY TO AMEND THE LANGUAGE TO REQUIRE WORKERS TO PROVIDE PROOF OF A POSITIVE TEST AND LASTLY THE REASON COVER NINETEEN IS INCLUDED UNDER BOTH INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND RESPIRATORY ILLNESSES IS BECAUSE BECAUSE IT IS BOTH IS BOTH AN INFECTIOUS AND RESPIRATORY ILLNESS THE LIKELIHOOD OF PANDEMICS HAS INCREASED OVER THE PAST CENTURY BECAUSE OF GLOBALIZATION. AND CHANGES IN LAND USE AND OUR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT WHEN WE FACE ANOTHER PANDEMIC WE CANNOT FIND OURSELVES IN THE SAME SITUATION WE ARE TODAY WERE HEALTH CARE WORKERS ARE UNPROTECTED WHEN THEY ARE THE ONES ON THE FRONTLINE SAVING LIVES SB EIGHT EIGHTY THREE WE WILL UPDATE OUR WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM. HEALTH WORKERS WHO INTERACT WITH OF SICK INJURED PEOPLE EVERY. ARE PROVIDED BENEFIT. PROVIDING WORKERS COMP AND COMPENSATION PRESUMPTION IS IMPORTANT TO PROTECTING OUR HEALTH CARE WORKERS AND EACH AND TO ENSURE THAT WHEN THEY ARE INJURED THERE NOT DENIED THE BENEFITS THEY DESERVE OR THAT THERE IS NO DELAY IN THEIR TREATMENT. THIS WILL PROVIDE PARITY IN OUR SYSTEM WHICH CURRENTLY GRANT THESE PRESUMPTIONS TO CERTAIN FIRST RESPONDERS ALL THESE WORKERS RISK THEIR LIVES AND WELL BEING EVERY DAY AT WORK I ASK THAT YOU RECOGNIZE THE CRITICAL DANGEROUS WORK HAVE. HEALTH CARE WORKERS DO BY GRANT PRESUMPTIONS AS WELL. I AM PROUD TO BE A PRAGMATIC PERSON AND ALWAYS CONSIDER DATA AS A VERY IMPORTANT DRIVER OF GOOD PUBLIC POLICY WE DO NOT HAVE THE WHOLE PICTURE OF THE LAWN FOR CLAIMS WE HAVE FIELD EXPERIENCES AS YOU WILL HEAR FROM THE MAIN WITH THIS. I ASK YOU TO LISTEN CAREFULLY THEIR TESTIMONY AND RELY FIX. IF CLAIMS INCREASE IT IS BECAUSE THE DANGERS OF THE WORKPLACE HAVE INCREASED WE HAVE CERTAINLY SEEN AS FOR ITS OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS THE DANGERS EVERY DAY. WORK HASN'T BEEN THIS ARE HIGHER SO TO HAVE WORK THE INCREASE FOR HEALTHCARE WORKERS SB EIGHT NINETY THREE IS A STEP. IN THE CHAIN ECHO. J. THE CALL. THANK YOU RESPECT.

TO KILL THE UNDERTAKER IN HOUSE EXPERT BUT ALSO WANTED AT THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION IS EQUALLY AS OPPOSED- FOR THE PURPOSES OF TECHNOLOGY I'M- GIVING THEIR- A POSITION AS WELL. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATORS CAN YOU HEAR ME OK. THIS IS THE THINKING OF THE MASK OKAY THANK YOU. I'M I'M A HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S HOSPITALS WE JUST WE WANT TO- ASSURE YOU THAT KEEPING PATIENTS AND HEALTHCARE WORKERS SAFE IS PARAMOUNT- TO OUR ACTIVITY WE ARE EXTREMELY GRATEFUL TO THE COMMITMENT OF THE FRONT LINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS. WHO COME TO WORK EVERY DAY TO HELP OTHERS IN NEED AND KNOW THAT WITHOUT HEALTHY EMPLOYEES HOSPITALS COULD NOT FULFILL THEIR MISSION OF CARE. FOR THEIR PATIENTS AND COMMUNITIES. I ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE. THAT THE CODE RESPONSE HAS BEEN EXTREMELY CHALLENGING. AND WE SUPPORT OUR HEALTH CARE WORKERS AND WE ARE WORKING. DILIGENTLY TO SECURE PP ADMITS A GLOBAL SHORTAGE. THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER ADDRESSES. OF THE PRESUMPTION WORKERS COMP- FOR COVERT SPECIFIC. CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE CHAIRS BILL DOES AS WELL AND GIVEN THE FROM PRESIDENTE CIRCUMSTANCE RECOGNIZE ON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT SO I'M GOING TO DIRECT MY COMMENTS TO THE REMAINDER OF THE BILL. WHEN WORK RELATED INJURIES OCCUR AT HOSPITALS BOTH WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS RELY ON THE EXISTING WORKERS COMP. SYSTEM WHICH IS A NO FAULT SYSTEM THE BROAD NATURE OF THIS BILL WOULD EXTEND PRESUMPTIONS FOR MUSCO SKELETAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES INTO THE PRIVATE SECTOR WITH NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THIS MONUMENTAL CHANGE. THERE IS BEEN FEW IF ANY COMPLAINTS THAT THE CURRENT PROCESS IS NOT WORKING FOR AGAIN MUSCO SKELETAL INJURIES AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES I'M OUTSIDE OF KOBE WHICH IS. YOU KNOW EXTREMELY UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCE- FOR EXAMPLE A MEDIUM SIZED CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE SYSTEM MUSCO SKELETAL INJURIES TOLD BETWEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN. OF THOSE THIRTEEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN CASES ONLY 2% WERE DENIED FOLLOWING INVESTIGATION. ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL EXPLICITLY PROHIBITS CONSIDERATION OF A PRE EXISTING CONDITION WHICH IS OTHERWISE ALLOWED UNDER WORKER'S COMPENSATION ROLES THIS IS CALLED APPORTIONMENT. THIS CREATES A NEW STRICT LIABILITY STANDARD ELIMINATES ANY ABILITY TO APPORTION THE CLAIM THAT SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASING THE COST OF EACH CLAIM. AND WHILE IT'S DIFFICULT TO- QUALIFY THE PRESUMPTION BECAUSE OF THIS PRESUMPTION IT WILL LIKELY LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN CLAIMS. APPROXIMATELY 75% OF CALIFORNIANS HOSPITALS FROM SMALL RURAL HOSPITALS TO LARGE COUNTY HOSPITALS ARE SELF INSURED. ANY INCREASE IN WORKERS COMPENSATION COSTS WILL HAVE A DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL ABILITY OF HOSPITALS TO PROTECT ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY CARE. TAKEN TOGETHER THESE CHANGES WOULD INCREASE COSTS TO HOSPITALS CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS HAVE LOST OVER TEN BILLION DOLLARS IN THE SHORT TERM ALONE DUE TO COVERT NINETEEN PREPARATION WORK IN RESPONSE. IT IS BEEN DEMONSTRATED THAT THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM IS WORKING CJ ASKS YOU TO VOTE NO ON THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU YOU HAVE USED THE THREE MINUTES OF TIME. IF WE COULD HAVE THE UNDERSTAND THE ME TO PART OF THIS THANK YOU. YOU HAVE TEN MINUTES OF- OF TIME ALLOTTED FOR THOSE IN- OPPOSITION TO SB.

BREAKING IT CREATION OF CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE DISTRICT. ALSO IN OPPOSITION. THERE ARE NO FOR THE LINES IN THE QUEUE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU TO ALL OF OUR SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION WITNESSES WE WILL NOW BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO MEMBERS. OF THE COMMITTEE. NAY COMMENTS FROM. THE DOCTRINE. THANK YOU CENTER CARRIER FOR- YOUR PRESENTATION AND- BRING THIS BILL FORD I THINK THE THING I'M STRUGGLING WITH IS I KNOW THAT OFTENTIMES YOU KNOW THERE IS A PRESUMPTIVE- PRESUMPTION FOR A- GROUP OF WORKERS- IN PUBLIC SAFETY AND OFTENTIMES POINTED THE DAD WILL THEY HAVE THE PRESUMPTION WHY NOT US. THE SAME TIME I THINK THERE IS CONCERN THAT- THE WAY WE STRUCTURED WORKERS COMPENSATION IS THAT- WE DO HAVE A PROCESS IN WHICH- PEOPLE GO THROUGH AND YOU KNOW IT'S A HOP IN A CONTENTIOUS BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN. LABOR IN BUSINESS ABOUT THIS BUT THERE'S GENERALLY GALLON THE AND THERE'S SOME KIND OF AGREEMENTS AND TERMS OF POLICY TERMS OF STRIKING A BALANCE. RATE AND SO IN SOME WAYS ONE CAN ARGUE AND YOU CAN POINT TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY FOLKS AND SAY WELL THEY GOT IT HOW COME WE DON'T BUT- I THINK THERE'S ALSO AN ARGUMENT TO SAY WELL. WHAT'S I GUESS BROKEN IN TERMS OF THE CURRENT SYSTEM MAC MECHANISM OF BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY IN A PORTION- THINGS BECAUSE THE AYE AYE WILK KNOWLEDGE DE DE CORPS. ARGUMENT IS CORRECT ARE THAT. WE HAVE- NURSES AND OTHER EALTHCARE WORKERS ON THE FRONT LINES WHO ARE BEING EXPOSED POTENTIALLY TO. DANGERS PATHOGENS NOT ONLY TO THE NINETEEN BY THE WAY I MEAN THAT'S A NEW ONE BUT- TO THE OTHER ONES THAT YOU BROUGHT UP. SO WILL CERTAINLY NOT DENYING THAT. THERE ARE BUT TO HAVE STILL USE THAT PRODUCT USE THE EXISTING PROCESS TO SAY WELL. YOU KNOW THIS IS HOW WE DECIDE OR SHOW THAT THIS WAS WORK RELATED AND THEREFORE- YEAH YOU GET COMPENSATION WORKERS COMPENSATION REGULAR COVERAGE ALL OF THE BENEFITS AND SO FORTH. VERSUS SAYING THAT WELL ACTUALLY YOU DON'T HAVE TO YOU KNOW WORK WE'RE GOING TO. CHANGE THE BALANCE THERE IN TERMS OF THE LEVELS. I GUESS AN ALLEYWAY ASIAN BECAUSE IT'S A PRESUMPTION NOW IT'S A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION GOT IT YOU KNOW THAT- PLAYER CAN REBUT. SO BIGGEST WHY ARE WE TRYING TO KNOW WHAT THE WHAT THE WHY WE TRYING TO CHANGE THAT BALANCE- AND IT REALLY THIS IS FOR YOU KNOW AGAIN I'M NOT SAYING THERE'S THAT NOT WITHOUT MERIT THAT THIS GROUP OF WORKERS ARE. PARTICULAR EXPOSED TO THESE PARTICULAR- CONDITIONS THAT YOU'VEBROUGHT UP IN THIS BILL- BUT THERE'S OTHER WORKERS OUT THERE AS WELL. BOUNCE PUBLIC SAFETY WORKERS TO. CONNECT THE SAME ARGUMENT. AND THAT. YOU KNOW WE- SHOULD. SHOULD WE BE DOING IT MORE BROADLY HE- AND HE DOES THAT AND THAT YEAH WE- WE OFTEN ARE HERE AT THE ENDS AROUND HERE IN THE LAST WORKERS COMP BACK AND FORTH AS WELL- IS THIS REALLY THE WAITED. TO THIS AND ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE CURRENT MECHANISM FOR TRYING. TO GET TO WORKERS COMPENSATION IS. BROKEN ARE IT'S- TELL. YEAH THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION IF YOU HAVE. THIS IS THE WAY THAT THAT I SEE IT AND- THE THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE WE HAVE CREATED IT. A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE CERTAIN RISKS AND WE DETERMINED THAT BECAUSE OF THOSE RISK THEY SHOULD GET A PRESUMPTION AND THEN WE HAVE ANOTHER GROUP. THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE KIND OF RISK THAT THEY UNDERGO THEY'RE EXACTLY THE SAME WITH WITH SOME DIFFERENCE THEY'RE NOT OUT ON THE STREETS RUNNING AROUND BUT THAT THEY'RE DEALING WITH THE-SAME. INJURIES THE SAME BODY FLUIDS THE SAME. DISEASES AND IT'S IT I LIKE AND IT I LIKEN IT VERY MUCH TO THE SITUATION IT'S CREATED WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT JOB CLASSIFICATIONS AND WE'VE WE'VE CREATED A BENEFIT THAT ONE GROUP GETS AND WHEN YOU START LOOKING AT THE JOBS THAT THEY DO. YOU FIND OUT THAT THEY'RE DOING THE EXACT SAME JOBS BUT ONE GROUP IS A GROUP OF WOMEN AND THEY'RE GETTING PAID TWO THIRDS WHAT THE OTHER GROUP IT'S DOING THE EXACT SAME WORK AT THE EXACT SAME. JOB DUTIES BUT THEY'RE GETTING PAID MUCH MORE AND SO THIS IS IT THIS IS A SITUATION OF EQUITY. AND THE EQUITY SAYS WHY IS IT THAT THERE'S THAT THAT THE GROUP THE FIRST RESPONDERS ON THE SCENE. GET THE BED THAT GET THAT BENEFIT BUT YOU PASS THE PIT. OFF GROUP THEN HAS TO BRIGHTEST ALL IN BY WHAT DO WITH THE IN. WE ATE OH BY YOUR DIFFERENT BECAUSE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND DE BECAUSE YOU'RE YOUR YOUR JOB IS DIFFERENT THAN THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ON THE FRONTLINE MOTHER ALL ON THE FRONT LINE AND THERE THEIR RESEARCH. SAME DISEASE PAGE. THEY INJURED. THE SAME INDIVIDUAL THAT NEEDS TO BE. DID AND MOVE. AND TREAT. AND THE SAME BODILY FLUIDS AND I AND TO ME IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE SENSE THAT WE WOULDN'T. AT LEAST CONSIDER. THAT THE PRESUMPTION MAKES SENSE FOR ONE GROUP WHY IT SHOULD NOT MAKE SENSE FOR THE OTHER GROUP AS WELL AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE MISSED BECAUSE OF THE TRUNCATED- TESTIMONY IS SPECIFIC NURSES TALKING ABOUT. THEIR EXPERIENCES THEIR EXPERIENCES WHERE THEIR HR TO PRESSURES THEM TO USE VACATION TIME AND THEIR OWN INSURANCE RATHER THAN GOING THROUGH A WORKERS COMP SYSTEM. WHERE THE INTIMIDATION NOT TO FILE A CLAIM BECAUSE THEY ARE DEPENDENT ON THE JOB. FOR COULD. INFORMATION ON HOW. ACCESS WORK COMPENSATION BENEFITS AT THEIR PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT AND SO THESE ARE THESE ARE REAL STORIES FROM REAL NURSES AND- AND THE- THE QUESTION BECOMES. YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE SYSTEM THAT'S FAIR TO. WILL THEY GET THEIR BENEFITS THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO WHICH IS- THE KINDS OF BENEFITS THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO RECOUP. FROM FOR A- THIS OR IN IN THAT THE EIGHT UP TO AT WORK AND JUST DIFFERENT THE FACT THAT IT JUST A FOLLOW UP THEN RIGHT I GUESS YOU KNOW- DUE TO MY THE OTHER WORKERS AS WELL YOU CAN MAKE THE SAME ARGUMENT FOR. YOU KNOW REALIZE THAT NO BILL IS PERFECT- TYSON COMPASS EVERYTHING SO NOT ASKING THAT. BUT ARE YOU SAYING THEREFORE WE SHOULD RESTRUCTURE WORKERS COMP SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT WE- PEOPLE. THAT EVERYONE WHO IS DOING ESSENTIALLY SHOULD GET REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION. BUT I'M WHAT I'M SAYING TODAY IS JUST THAT WE TAKE ONE SMALL LITTLE STEP- MADE IT TO STEPS THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN BUT I'M HOPING THAT WE GET UNIVERSAL HEALTH HEALTH CARE THIS ALL GOES AWAY BECAUSE THEN WE DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT A WORKERS COMP SYSTEM BUT THAT JUST. THAT JUST YOU KNOW DOWN THE FUTURE OKAY WELL THE IT AND I'D LIKE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION TO LATER BUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU A PAN SENATOR JACKSON THANK YOU I CERTAINLY- SEE THE- GENDER ASPECT OF THIS- AND BUT I HAVE VOTED IN THE PAST I DID VOTE TO GIVE THESE PRESUMPTIONS TO. SOME OF OUR FIRST RESPONDERS. BECAUSE THE DATA SHOWED THAT THEY WERE NOT. GET BEING GIVEN- WHAT I THOUGHT WAS THE APPROPRIATE RECOGNITION FOR THE FOR THE FACT THAT THEIR JOBS DID OFTEN PUT THEM. IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY- WOULD EXPERIENCE ARE WORK RELATED INJURY- SO I DO IT SO I DO SEE THAT VERY DIFFERENTLY- BUT MY QUESTION IS ARE- BASED UPON THE OPPOSITION. THAT INDICATED THAT ALL BUT 2% OF THESE CLAIMS. ARE ARE GRANTED. I'M AT THE MY QUESTION IS WHAT WHERE IS THE- I'M- DOES IT LIKE THAT WHEN THESE NURSES BEING ON THE FRONT LINES IN BEING ASKED TO WEAR GARBAGE BAGS AND HAVE NO MASKS AND ARE DYING FROM THE THAT LACK OF CONSIDERATION- AND PROTECTION- THAT THERE ARE THOSE CLAIMS ARE GOING TO BE RECOGNIZED AND HONORED SO AND I THINK WE ARE FOCUSING MOST OF US AT THIS POINT ON THE COVE IN NINETEEN SITUATION BECAUSE EVERY DAY WE HEAR ABOUT MORE OF FRONTLINE PEOPLE AND THE NURSES AND MEDICAL PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF. A PROTECTION THAT THEY ARE GETTING ON THE JOB. SO FOCUSING EVEN ON THAT OR- WELL NO I TAKE THAT BACK FOCUSING FOCUSING ON THE BILL WHICH OF INCLUDED WHICH ARE ALSO MUSCULAR SKELETAL PROBLEMS I KNOW YEARS AGO WE TALKED ABOUT THIS SENATOR. BABY IS THAT THE TIME ASSEMBY MEMBER KILL WAS VERY ACTIVE IN TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROVIDED OPPORTUNITIES FOR NURSES WHEN THEY TO LIFT PATIENTS TO HAVE PROTECTIONS BECAUSE WE WERE SAYING A LOT OF INJURIES BACK INJURIES AND SO FORTH. I DID NOT SENSE FROM THE TESTIMONY PERHAPS YOU CAN CLARIFY THAT THERE THAT THESE THE NURSES AND MEDICAL PEOPLE- THAT YOU'RE SEEKING THIS PRESUMPTION FOR OR ARE DENIED THERE ARE CLAIMS. BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF THAT PRESUMPTION. WELL I YEAR REFERRING TO A SPECIFIC STATISTIC THAT COMES FROM ONE LIMITED SOURCE OKAY AND I WAS TRYING TO THE CAR FIRING IS AND ALL THE PAPER THAT I GOT IT MAYBE STEPHANIE CAN. CAN ADDRESS THAT ISSUE BUT- BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS IT WAS A CLASS OF SMALL- AS- HOSPITALS IT DID NOT INCLUDE BIG URBAN HOSPITALS IN THE IN THE EVALUATION BUT I AM. BUT THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO ME BECAUSE I DO I DO AGREE THAT THERE IS SOME GENDER. I'M THINKING OF THESE WERE DOCTORS AT MOST OF THE MORNING. THE COVER. BUT IT GOT. HERE THAT THERE WERE IN FACT THIS PRO SO PERHAPS STEPHANIE WITH THE CHAIRS PERMISSION COULD COULD GET TO HER TO RESPOND TO THAT. OF COURSE MISS ROBERSON. ARE YOU STILL ON THE CALL. I MINE AND I AND I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD SHARE IT THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE TIME FOR ONE. TELL YOU THE STORY OF DOT NURSES ON THE LINE NOTHING NEWMAN NAY. ON THE ACTUAL THE NILE WE THOUGHT. BY NOW- OF THE NURSES. THAT HIGH OR COPPER OVER COLLUDED RELATED DON'T AND SECONDLY I THINK YOU KNOW BUT THERE. I LIMITED ON THAT THE VERY BEGINNING YOU KNOW WE ARE DEALING WITH AN ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE NURSES ARE OVERWHELMING. SURE TO USE THEIR PPO INSECT. OVERWHELMINGLY PRESSURED IN AN ENVIRONMENT. YEAH DEAL WITH I MEAN THIS IS ME PRESSURE COOKER WE ARE SAYING IN THE MEDICAL FIELD AND WHAT THEY WORK ON THAT NURSES PACKAGES TAKE CARE I JUST HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT JUST HAVE TO PICK UP THE SLACK SO THERE'S THAT GOLD DATA YOU KNOW IF YOU WILL THAT YOU WON'T NECESSARILY BE BECAUSE THE NURSES. ARE BY AND LARGE. YOU KNOW WE ALL WE NEED TO BE YOU KNOW DIVERTED. FROM YOU KNOW FINALLY. FIRST WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE STORY THAT THAT YOU'LL HEAR AND- AND PEOPLE THAT LEGISLATION PASSED. ON MALE COUNTERPARTS WE DON'T THEY FORCE BACK AND THE DATE THAT THEY DON'T DESERVE THE REDUCTIONS THEY ABSOLUTELY DO. BUT THEY HAVE NOT HAD TO- MEET THE STANDARDS THAT YOU'RE BEING OUT OVER AND OVER AGAIN FOR THIS. ARE NOW CAL I'M NOT HAD THE GOOD THAT THE KEEP FOR THEY HAVE A WHOLE HOST OF PRESUMPTION. MEMBERS I WOULD JUST CAUTION MARK IF IT. TO FOR A NEW SUBJECT FROM. HI THERE ARE A LOT DANIEL YOU CAN YOU. A HANDFUL OF OUR CA CALLED IMPOSSIBLE UP TO TWENTY. THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING COULD NOT WORK COMP FOR LIKE NOW. YOU KNOW I DO DOUBT. I DON'T HAVE TO HEAR THE STORY I SUSPECT THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE GIVEN THE FACT THAT. THERE TENDS TO BE THESE PRESSURES THAT ARE PUT ON. OF SADLY. THAT THE FEMALE. OUR WORK THE THAT NECESSARILY APPLY TO OUR MAIL OR WORK FORCE AND I CAN IF THERE ARE IN FACT THOSE SITUATIONS THAT'S REALLY WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR. MY CONCERN THOUGH IS WE'RE REALLY TALKING A COVERT NINETEEN NOW. THAT THAT THERE WERE SEEN THIS- SO IF THAT IF THAT WERE THE ONLY ASPECT OF THIS BILL I AM. A HUNDRED AND 20% IN- BUT YOU ALSO TALK ABOUT THE MUSCULAR SKELETAL PROBLEMS AT SO MY QUESTION IS ARE THOSE. DO WE HAVE DATA THAT SHOWS THAT. THAT THESE NURSES ARE DENIED TO CLAIMS- WHERE AS OUR FIREFIGHTERS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AREN'T PART IN THEIR PRIMARILY MAIL. AND THEIR LEGITIMATE CLAIM SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT THERE ARE IN THESE ALLEGED MIX BEING FILED BY NURSES THAT THEY ARE BEING DENIED AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT IF THEY WERE. DAD AT LEGITIMATE CLAIMS OF MUSCULOSKELETAL PROBLEMS BECAUSE OF LIFTING PATIENTS AND WHAT HAVE YOU- THAT THAT WAS A NON ACCEPTABLE BIAS GENDER BIAS SO DO WE HAVE. A PERHAPS STEPHANIE D. CAN YOU. A THAT'S BUT- PART OF THIS BILL. MS ROBERTSON. RIGHT SENATOR SENATOR JACK. THE BILL AND I pGET THAT LAST PART I I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT THIS BILL DOESN'T CHARGED OF A DEAL WITH A COVERT NINETEEN IT DEALS WITH OTHER ISSUES- THE MUSCULAR SKELETAL PROBLEMS- IT RESPIRATORY DISEASES MARI. MY QUESTION IS ARE WE SEEING DENIALS OF LEGITIMATE CLAIMS THAT WE DON'T SEE WITH THE PRESUMPTION THAT THAT OUR OTHER FIRST RESPONDERS PRIMARILY MAIL ARE GETTING BY IS THAT A PROBLEM BECAUSE I DIDN'T HEAR THAT AS PART OF THE- PRESENTATION SO I I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHETHER- I DON'T HAVE ANY DOUBT ABOUT COLBERT BUT I'M JUST WONDERING JUST HOW SERIOUS A PROBLEM THIS IS IN FACT ON THOSE OTHER ASPECTS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO INCLUDE IN THIS BILL. SURE SURE AND I AND I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND I DO APOLOGIZE AT THE TOP OF THAT. THAT THAT THE MONEY THAT I DEALT WITH A LOT OF TIME I THOUGHT I FIND MYSELF AT ABOUT A- FORTY FIVE SO YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE- AND THEIR FAULT SO. IS ON THE LINE BY YOUR- SHE HAD A WORK. COMP CASE THAT WAS THE NIGHT FORMER SO YEAH THOSE THOSE THOSE CLAIMS HAVE BEEN THE NOT. ON MERIT AND OTHER INFECTIONS BEYOND HOPE FOR THEM SO WE WANTED TO DEFINITELY IN ONE MINUTE ON THE STORY AND AGAIN I WOULD GET I WOULD CONTINUE TO THE YEAH YOU KNOW REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT WHEN SB FIVE FORTY TWO WENT THROUGH THAT CAN MAYBE IT WAS THE STARTED OUT ON PTSD YOU ALL DID NOT. REQUIRE CLAIMS DENY ALL ON ON THAT AND SO YOU KNOW. THIS IS ABOUT RIGHT IN FACT THIS IS ABOUT HI HOW THE JOB AND AGAIN THE ADDED LAYER OF WHAT. THE BILL. YOU GET HAVE TO SUCK IT UP YEAH DAY HE THIRTEEN YELLING THAT TIME WE'VE BEFORE COMMITTEE. I CAN TALK ABOUT THAT ACTUALLY PUT IN MY THAT THANK MISTER OVER OF SHOOT THAT TO. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS AS MAY YES ABOUT VERY MUCH. TO RECOVER YOUR WOULD YOU MY I'M SORRY VERY BRIEFLY RESTATING THE AMENDMENT YOU'RE TAKING OF I'M TRYING TO BALANCE WHAT YOU SAID WITH THE ANALYSIS WITH TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S NO LONGER ARE THE MOMENT YOU STATED THEY REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS. THAT FOR THE OKAY THAT WE'RE NOT. GOING TO PAY FOR CHINA I THOUGHT IT WAS ME ALWAYS OKAY SO LET ME LISTEN. SO THE FIRST ONE HAD TO DO WITH- THE DEATH THAT USE OF THE CORONA VIRUS AS THE- AS THE INFECTIOUS DISEASE AND- AND THE ALLEGATION WAS THE WAY THAT THE SENTENCE WAS WRITTEN HUH. IT COULD BE INTERPRETED THAT IT INCLUDED THE COLORADO WHO BOUGHT IT NEVER INSTALLED IN THAT TO HAPPEN YOU NARAL THAN JUST TO CALL THAT NINETEEN. WELL IT WOULD BE NARROWED- YES YES TO FIT THE DEFINITION OF THE STATUTE WHERE WHERE- IT IT'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN. DETERMINED TO BE A DISEASE. THAT IT'S NOT THE FLU IT'S NOT A RECURRING GOT IT OKAY SO- THAT'S THAT'S NUMBER ONE AND THAT THE SECOND ONE IS. TRY TO REMEMBER WHAT THE SECOND ONE WAS THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE THERE'S THERE ARE NUMBER POSSIBILITIES IN TERMS OF LIMITING THAT THE BILL AND I WAS WILLING. TO AT LEAST CONSIDER SUB SOME OF THEM THE PROBLEM IS WE DIDN'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO NEGOTIATED TO DEAL WITH THAT. SO FIRST WAS WAS- WAS THAT IN THE OTHER ONE WAS. DURING. LOW BLOOD SUGAR. AND THE REASON I ASK IS BECAUSE LIKE YOU SAID LOW BLOOD SUGAR I THOUGHT I HEARD MONTH GILLES SKELETAL TO THEM THAT YOU CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT THAT BUT HE SAID HE WAS A MAN IN THAT OUT BUT YOU'RE NOT. MANY KNOW THAT WASN'T ONE OF OKAY. WITH THE A SYMPTOMATIC COVERAGE. OKAY TO ME WITH THAT IF IT DOES IF IT INCLUDES THE REAL INCLUDES IF YOU'RE A SYMPTOMATIC- AND THEN GET GET THE- DOT VANIK IT COVERS YOU KNOW WILL BE RELATED THAT IS CORRECT IN AND SO INSTEAD OF IT SAYING IN IN A SYMPTOMATIC- YOU WOULD IT WOULD REQUIRE THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE TEST AND THE TO BE POSITIVE. GOT IT SO FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE. HOW DOES. IN THIS ASPECT OF YOUR BILL DIFFERENTIATE FROM THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER FROM THE OTHER BILLS THAT ARE COMING THROUGH FOCUSING ON COAL BID HELLO SO THE TWO THINGS THAT IT DOES IS INCLUDES MUSCO SKELETAL- AND- AND THE- AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES RIGHT AND- THIS WOULD NOT TAKE EFFECT UNTIL AFTER. JANUARY FIRST OF NEXT YEAR. I IT'S NOT AN URGENCY BILL- AND SO IT TO THE ANTICIPATED THAT THE GOVERNOR IF THERE'S A RECALL IF THERE'S A NEED FOR HIM TO CONTINUE HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER HE'LL DO IT RIGHT. SO HELP ME I'VE GOT A LETTER FROM MY HOME COUNTY. THAT FOCUSES ON MUSCULOSKELETAL. BUT DURING THAT AND- YOU KNOW RUNNING A LARGE. COUNTY HEALTH SYSTEM THEY GIVE LOTS OF STATISTICS AW AND PRICE TAGS AROUND IF YOUR BILL WERE TO BECOME LAW WHAT WOULD YOUR COUNTER TO THAT BE NOT THIS LA COUNTY BUT ANY COUNTY OR ANY LARGE HEALTH SYSTEM. I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE THAT ARE BUILT INTO THE LETTERS THAT I RECEIVED IN THAT IT LOOKED AT ONE IS THAT- IS THAT IT IS AND- I THINK THAT THE WORD THEY WERE USING WAS A CONCLUSIVE PRESUMPTION. THAT THAT'S NOT ANTICIPATED BY THE BILL AND THAT'S NOT WHAT THE POLICE OR FIRE HAVE EITHER- THAT IS A STANDARD THAT IS PULLED OUT OF SOMEWHERE AND STUCK IN FRONT OF A IN FRONT OF THE LANGUAGE OF THAT WORKERS COMP IN SO THAT. WOULD I THINK BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PRESENT ANY TESTIMONY TO OVERCOME THAT KIND OF THAT PRESUMPTION AND THAT'S NOT WHAT IT'S WHAT'S INTENDED. BUT THEN THEN THEY USE THE LANGUAGE THAT IS A STRICT LIABILITY- AND THIS ISN'T STRICT LIABILITY THIS IS THIS IT THERE'S IT'S A PRESUMPTION AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STRICT LIABILITY IN PRESUMPTION IS IT STRICTLY BE THE BILL ANY MEANS HOW YOU PAY FOR IT NO MATTER WHAT. WHICH IS WHAT GETS YOU INTO THE CONCLUSIVE PRESUMPTION AS WELL SO WORDS BECOME IMPORTANT- THIS IS NOT A STRICT LIABILITY ISSUE IT'S EASY TO A PORTION- THERE THE RISKS. ACCORDING TO YOU KNOW IF YOU WORK FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ORGANIZATION- IT'S DONE ALL THE TIME AND SO- THAT TO MEET IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE- A REAL ISSUE BUT BUT LET ME JUST SAY THAT THAT. YOU KNOW ON THE ONE HAND IT'S ARGUED. THAT NURSES ARE ALREADY- HELP YOU KNOW FIRST LINE HELP HELP HEALTHCARE WORKERS ARE ALREADY GETTING ALL OF THE BENEFITS BET BET. THAT DATE THERE'S NO ONE. RED IS NOT RECEIVING THE BENEFITS THAT DIDN'T. GET IT AT THE WORK. I'M AND THEN ON THE SAME TOKEN WHEN THEY SAY WELL IF YOU DO EVER BUT ABOUT PERCEPTION. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT MORE COSTS I WOULD ARGUE THAT- THAT IS A KNEE JERK REACTION. TO A CHANGE IN THE SYSTEM AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT'S TRUE. BECAUSE IF THEY'RE ALREADY GETTING. THE BENEFITS THEN HOW CAN IT GO UP WHEN THEY YOU GET THE CONCLUSIVE PRESUMPTION WITH THAT I'M NOT CONCLUSIVE THE REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION WHAT. THE REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION DOES IS IT KEEPS YOU OUT OF THAT WHOLE SYSTEM. OF DOING THE MEDICAL REVIEW AND IF YOU'VE EVER TALKED TO A WORKER THAT'S GONE THROUGH THAT MEDICAL REVIEW PROCESS WHAT HAPPENS IS YOUR DOCTOR TAKES A LOOK AT YOU. EXAMINED YOU DOES A REPORT SENDS IT INTO WORKERS COMP AND WORKERS COMP SENDS IT OUT TO AN OUT OF STATE DOCTOR. WHO JUST LOOKED AT THE PAPERWORK AND DETERMINES WHETHER WHAT WHAT YOUR DOCTOR SAID IS TRUE OR NOT AND WHETHER. YOU'RE HURTING LIKE YOU SAY OR NOT AND THAT COSTS MONEY AND THAT DELAYS THE SYSTEM AND IT IT- IT'S A IT'S A BURDEN ON THE SYSTEM IN YES IT'S USED TO WEED OUT FRAUD. BUT BUT IN IN THIS KIND OF AN INSTANCE IF IN FACT THE NURSES ARE ALREADY GETTING THERE'S BENEFITS WHAT'S THE ADDITIONAL COST YOU'RE ACTUALLY SAVING MONEY BY NOT SENDING IT OUT FOR THESE. MEDICAL REVIEW SO I THINK PART OF IT IS JUST A KNEE JERK REACTION TO A SITUATION THAT TO CHANGE AND I GET THE CHANGE MAKES PEOPLE REALLY NERVOUS IN IN A BUSINESS- ENVIRONMENT YOU WANT CERTAINTY BUT- BUT I IT'S THIS IS ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE- AT. I FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT THAT WE'VE SET UP A SYSTEM IN THE SYSTEM IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE. FOR GUN AT. I RECOGNIZE A BENEFIT FOR ONE MORE GROUP OF WORKERS AND THE AND THE SAME. THE SAME INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE BEING TRANSFERRED INJURED AND INFECTIOUS TO ANOTHER GROUP AND THEY'RE TAKING RESPONSIBILITY IN ACTUALLY SPENDING A WHOLE HECK OF A LOT MORE TIME THAN THE POLICE AND FIREFIGHTERS THEN IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME NOT TO. NOT TO DO IT. IF I MAY WITH CHAIR- BUT I REALLY JUST LOSE MY QUESTION ON MY OWN PIECE OF PAPER. AT ONE THING I WOULD SAY I THINK. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THIS BILL DOES NOTHING WITH REGARD TO THE PROVISION OF PP I JUST THINK YOU KNOW WE HEARD THIS BILL LAST YEAR AND WHILE I APPRECIATE THE ADDITION OF COLD IT TOO AND I THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE IN KEEPING WITH THE OTHER BILLS AS WELL AS EXECUTIVE ORDER I JUST. I DON'T WANT US TO COMBINE THE A MOTION THAT WE'RE ALL EXPERIENCING RECOGNIZING THAT NURSES ARE PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE EVERY DAY WITH THIS- DIFFERENT YET SIMILAR PUBLIC POLICY DISCUSSION THIS WILL THIS THE EIGHT WE LOOK VOTE THIS BILL OUT TODAY WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH MORE PP COMING INTO HOSPITALS FOR NURSES I JUST THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. THAT WE SEPARATE. WHAT'S IN FRONT OF US FROM THE EMOTION OF WHAT WE'RE ALL EXPERIENCING I JUST FELT THE NEED TO SAY THAT- I WAS STRUCK BY THE NOTION I APPRECIATE THAT IS ANECDOTAL- THAT NURSES ARE BEING- ENCOURAGED TO. NOT FOLLOW KIND OF CURRENT PROTOCOL WITH REGARD TO THE EXISTING SYSTEM AND BEING TOLD TO TAKE THEIR OWN PERSONAL TIME AND SICK TIME. AND IF THE CHAIR WOULD ALLOW- IN THE OF THE- THOSE IN OPPOSITION COULD COMMENT ON THAT BECAUSE THAT'S TROUBLING. PLEASE NO PLEASE GO AHEAD NO MATTER THANK OR THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION ARE YOU GOING TO KEEP THE FUN. WE CAN HEAR YOU OKAY GREAT- SO I MEAN IT IS THAT A TOTAL SO IT'S HARD FOR ME TO RESPOND- BUT WHAT I AM AWARE OF ITS EARLY AND ANYTHING THAT WAS AGAIN TO THE COVERT SITUATION. EARLY IN THE SITUATION THERE WAS A LOT OF. CHANGING GUIDANCE ON INFECTION CONTROL AND YOU KNOW I MEAN FROM THE CDC AND CITY PH AND CAL OSHA AND THE GOVERNOR. AND SO- SOME EMPLOYERS MIGHT HAVE. HAD EMPLOYEES. USE THEIR PAID TIME OFF EARLY IN THE PROCESS I THINK IT'S TIME MOVE DONE FRANKLY MOST HOSPITALS ACTUALLY MOVED TO A SITUATION WHERE THEY WERE EITHER GIVING ADDITIONAL TIME. I'M SORRY COATED- SPECIFIC RELATED PAID TIME OFF OF SOMEBODY WAS L. FOR HER IF. WORKERS COMP CLAIMS ARE FILED THEY WERE ACCEPTING THEM- AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY AFTER THE CHILDREN PLACE ORDER- YOU KNOW WHERE PEOPLE WERE REALLY. LEAVING THEIR HOMES TO GO TO WORK SO IT'S HARD TO RESPOND TO SOMETHING THAT I DON'T HAVE THE FACTS ON- I'M NOT GONNA SAY THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN EARLY ON BUT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT WHERE THINGS ENDED UP. AND THAT'S NOT WHERE THEY ARE NOT OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE OF THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE BOARD THAT'S FIGURE THAT'S FAIR THANK YOU LAST QUESTION FOR SAID TO CABALLERO- MY STAFF RIGHT IT SAYS THAT THE BILL CREATES- WORKERS COMP. PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY FOR NURSES AND OTHER HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES. WHO WHO ARE THE OTHERS THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT WORK IN THE SAME AND IN THE SAME SPACE OVER HE CAB I MEAN IS IT- WELL WE'VE WE'VE AS WE'VE ASSUME THEY'RE GOING TO BE THE TAX AND THE- THE- INDIVIDUALS A PROVIDE EMERGENCY SERVICES IN THROUGH THE EMERGENCY ROOMS. UNDER THE BILL ACTUALLY LIST THE OTHER- POSITIONS SO THEY DON'T. IT DOES NOT LIST THOSE POSITIONS. AND SO WHAT IS THE LANGUAGE IN THE ACTUAL BILL WHAT DOES IT SAY FOR NURSES AND IT DOES AFFECT OTHER HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES. IS THAT THE LANGUAGE ISSUES IN THE BILL. THIS GLOB COPY THE BILL IN FRONT OF ME MISTER BOWMAN TO. LARGE CONSULTANT CAN. THE CHAIR GETTING INBOUND STAFF SENATE LABOR COMMITTEE IT IT TALKS ABOUT- EMPLOYEES OF ACUTE THE HELP OF A HOSPITAL THE PROVIDE DIRECT PATIENT CARE GOT IT. OKAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR MITCHELL OTHER COMMENTS. FOR QUESTIONS SEEING NONE SENATOR COMPARE WHICH WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. WELL I'M THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS BILL AND TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ARE REALLY APPRECIATED HERE TODAY AS DIFFICULT AS IT IS TO NOT BE ABLE TO SEE PEOPLE AND NOT HAVE OUR WITNESSES HERE- I DO APPRECIATE IT AND I'M THIS IS THIS IS- THIS IS NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART- I HAVE NURSES IN MY FAMILY AND WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THESE- THESE KINDS OF INJURIES IN THE KIND OF CHALLENGES THAT THEY FACE JUST GETTING SOMEONE TO PAY ATTENTION. TO THEM ABOUT THEM AND SO- I REDUCE SPECTRAL YES RIGHT YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I DO. I THINK WE ALL APPRECIATE THAT PASSION THAT WE'VE HEARD THIS YEAR AND LAST YEAR OVER THIS- THIS BILL AND IT. I KNOW IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO YOU YOU AND YOUR DISTRICT AND YOUR FAMILY. UNFORTUNATELY IN ON OUR CONVERSATIONS I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND- I ATE AT FOR A COUPLE REASONS ONE WE'VE NOT THE STAFF WHICH THE NEED FOR THE PRESUMPTIONS THE DATA IT IS WE JUST CAN'T SEE IT SUPPORTS THAT. THERE MAY BE OTHER REASONS THAT PEOPLE THINK OR ANECDOTALLY WHY THERE SHOULD BE BUT THE DATA IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GO BY TODAY AND WELL I AGREE WITH THE SPIRIT OF THE- AMENDMENTS INCLUDING THE COVERT NINETEEN. OPTIONS I THINK THAT THEY GO TOO FAR EVEN IF YOU ADDRESS THE NOVEL PATHOGENS- ISSUE. YOU KNOW I JUST I FEEL THAT IT'S- IT'S DIRECTORS TOO MUCH WITHIN IT IT DOESN'T GO BECAUSE BEYOND THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER. AND I BELIEVE A PRESUMPTION NEEDS TO HAVE A SUNSET. BECAUSE OF THE CALL OUR REALITY WITH COVE IN NINETEEN HOPEFULLY IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS WILL BE DIFFERENT. THAN IT IS TODAY. AND WE NEED A MECHANISM TO BE ABLE TO REVISIT THAT AND- AS WELL AS THE PRESUMPTIONS AS THE REALITY CHANGES AS WE DEAL WITH. WITH THE- THE PANDEMIC AND COVERT NINETEEN- AND IT'S CERTAINLY THE ISSUE OF THE PPVS IS CRITICAL BUT THAT IS ANOTHER ISSUE AND- I THINK WE ALL WANT TO SUPPORT THAT EFFORT TO TRY. AND GET THAT SO- DO WE HAVE A MOTION ON. SB. EIGHT NINETY THREE THEY'LL- I WAS VERY GOOD THANK YOU WE HAVE A MOTION BY- SENATOR MITCHELL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS- PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MEMBERS PLEASE TURN ON YOUR MICROPHONES TO VOTE. SENATOR HILL NO. CENTER HILL NO CENTER MORALE NO. CENTER MORALE NO SENATOR JACKSON'S.

WHEN YOU'RE READY HE MAY PRESENT TO SB NINE FORTY THREE THANK OU FOR YOUR PATIENCE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH ME ON IMPROVING THIS BILL THROUGH THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS OUTLINING THE ANALYSIS WHICH I WILL BE ACCEPTING TODAY. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MILLION RECENTLY ENACTED TEMPORARILY PROGRAMS TO HELP EMPLOYEES WEATHER THE STORM CREATED BY COVERT NINETEEN. THESE ARE MUCH NEEDED PROGRAMS FAMILIES ARE STRUGGLING ESPECIALLY PARENTS. WITH ALL SCHOOLS CLOSED PARENTS ARE SCRAMBLING TO WORK AND CARE FOR THE CHILDREN. NEW FEDERAL PROGRAMS PROVIDE LEE FOR THOSE PARENTS CARING FOR THE CHILDREN WHEN DISPLACED FROM SCHOOL DURING THE CRISES HOWEVER THERE ARE GAPS IN THE PROGRAM THAT LEAVES SOME FAMILIES BEHIND. FEWER THAN HALF OF WORKERS ARE COVERED BY THE FEDERAL LEAVE PROGRAM. SO FOR EXAMPLE CALIFORNIANS WHO DO NOT QUALIFY INCLUDE PARENTS WHO WORK FOR IT FOR AN EMPLOYER WITH FIVE HUNDRED PLUS EMPLOYEES. SOME PARENTS WORK FOR EMPLOYER WITH FEWER THAN FIFTY EMPLOYEES AND ANY PARENT WITH CHILDREN DISPLACED FROM SCHOOL LONGER THAN THREE MONTHS WE ARE IN A CRISIS AND CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO STEP UP AND FILL THESE GAPS. SB NINE FOUR THREE ONE FOR ALL CALIFORNIA PARENTS HAVE PAID FAMILY LEAVE OPPORTUNITIES WHEN THEIR CHILD IS THIS PLACE FROM SCHOOL DUE TO COVERT NINETEEN.

I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DID ACKNOWLEDGE THE YEARS OF WORK AROUND PAID FAMILY LEAVE THAT OTHER MEMBERS OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS HAVE BROUGHT FORWARD SENATOR JACKSON HERE. A FORMER SENATOR- SHE LOOK KEWL AND I WOULD AGUE THAT EVEN THOUGH WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CALL THE CRISIS- ANY FAMILY. EXPERIENCING A SERIOUS ILLNESS- AWE AND HAVING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY MANAGE TAKING CARE OF A SICK. PARTNER OR SPOUSE OR CHILD- BEAT COLBERT ARE OR OR OTHERWISE- CERTAINLY IN MY HUMBLE OPINION HAVE DESERVED WHICH IS WHY I HAVE ALWAYS SUPPORTED PAID FAMILY LEAVE. AND SO I APPRECIATE YOU BRING IT FOR AND I HOPE. PERHAPS A MORE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE EVEN DURING THIS TIME OF CALL THAT COULD FIND THEMSELVES TO UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE. I KNOW IT'S NOT BEEN SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN SUPPORTED UNIVERSALLY FOR MANY YEARS- SO PERHAPS WITH YOUR BILL- CENTER CHIANG AND THE CURRENT CRISIS WE'RE EXPERIENCING. MORE PEOPLE WILL BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF Y. AID FAMILY LEAVE IS APPROPRIATE. JUST WANT TO ADD ON WE ALL KNOW THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARILY TOUGH TIME FOR FAMILIES STRUGGLING TO BALANCE WORK. AND FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES AND TEACH THEIR CHILDREN. ARE AMONG THE OTHER. DUTIES THAT THEY HAVE DURING THIS. VERY VERY CHALLENGING AND FRANKLY SCARY TIME FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE AND I AM ALSO DELIGHTED. TO HAVE MY COLLEAGUES NOW THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE JOIN US THIS IS BEEN. A BATTLE I HAVE. ENGAGED IN FOR MANY MANY YEARS- TO TRY TO READ IT'S HAVE PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THAT- THIS IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT TO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY HAVING PAID FAMILY LEAVE SO WE CAN CARE FOR OUR FAMILIES- FOR PARENTS AND GRAND CHILDREN WHEN THAT ARISES. BUT YOU KNOW THAT WAGE REPLACEMENT WITHOUT JOB PROTECTION BEHIND IT CREATES. CHALLENGES WERE A WORKER COULD LITERALLY BE FIRED FOR USING THE BENEFITS SO. WITH THIS WOULD- WOULD DEFINITELY I THINK WE HAVE TO ADD THAT OTHER ELEMENT AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MY COLLEAGUES ON. THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE ALSO WILL- SUPPORT UNIVERSAL JOB PROTECT PROTECTION. A PARTICULARLY IS- WAS PROPOSED ACTUALLY TODAY BY THE GOVERNOR AND HIS MAY REVISE SO- I DO SHARE. AN APPRECIATION THAT.

WARNER TO SB NINE SEVEN THREE SO JACK. YOU MAY PRESENT YOUR BILL TO GET RIGHT THERE WOULD YOU LIKE ME HAVE A THIS THAT WAY RIGHT. SEEING THIS BILL A COUPLE TIMES BEFORE- IT SEEKS TO CLOSE THE PAY GAP. LET ME SAY UP FRONT THAT I BELIEVE IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER WE CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR WAGE EQUALITY. AS WOMEN BEAR THE SIGNIFICANT BURDEN OF JOB LOSS IN UNPAID CARE GIVING RESPONSIBILITIES- DURING THIS PANDEMIC. THIS EASURE IS A BILL TO FIGHT PAY DISCRIMINATION WITH DATA WITH INFORMATION. BECAUSE IT CUT WHEN IT COMES TO PAY EQUITY FOR WOMEN AND MINORITIES WE CAN'T FIX WHAT WE CAN'T SEE. AND WE CAN'T FIX WHAT WE DON'T KNOW. THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE EMPLOYERS OF A HUNDRED EMPLOYEES OR MORE TO SUBMIT A PAY DATA REPORT ANNUALLY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING. OUTLINING THE COMPENSATION AND HOURS WORKED OF EMPLOYEES BY GENDER RACE ETHNICITY AND JOB CATEGORY IT WILL ALSO STRENGTHEN ENFORCEMENT OF THE CALIFORNIA FAIR PAY ACT. BY ALLOWING THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING TO ALSO ENFORCE THAT ACT IN COORDINATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT. OF THE PRIMARY GOALS OF SB NINE SEVENTY THREE OR TWO FULL. FIRST TO ENCOURAGE EMPLOYERS TO ANALYZE THEIR OWN PAY HIRING AND PROMOTION PRACTICES AND ALLOW FOR SELF CORRECTION. EXCUSE ME PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO JOB SEGREGATION IN OTHER WORDS TO TAKE THE DATA AND LOOK IN THE MIRROR TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE POLICIES THEY'RE HIRING AND PROMOTIONAL POLICIES ARE DISCRIMINATORY NOT NECESSARILY INTENTIONALLY SOUL BUT CHURCH THE REALITIES OF WHAT GOES ON IN THE WORKPLACE. AND THE BILL WILL ALSO ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING TOGETHER IMPORTANT DATA THAT ALLOWS THEM TO SEE PATTERNS OF WAGE DISPARITIES IN IF THEY NOTICED THOSE DEVIATIONS OR OUT LIARS TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER. THE INFORMATION WILL ALSO BE AVAILABLE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT IF THEY REQUESTED. THIS BILL IS CLOSELY MODELED AFTER EFFORTS THAT WERE STARTED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL- BUT HAVE SADLY A BEEN HALTED BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MAKING IT MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER THE CALIFORNIA PURSUE ITS OWN PATH FOR PAY DATA COLLECTION. TO COMBAT GENDER AND RACE BASED DISCRIMINATION. AND IN CASE YOU MIGHT BE IN DOUBT ABOUT THE VALUE WERE IMPACT OF THIS DATA I WILL POINT YOU TO THE CASE OF INTEL WHICH LATE LAST YEAR VOLUNTARILY RELEASED THIS DATA PUBLICLY. THE NUMBERS TRUE HEADLINE TO IMPROVE PROMPTED SOUL SEARCHING IN THE COMPANY AND CALLS FOR CHANGE. THE DATA REVEALED THAT FORTY ONE OF FIFTY TWO TOP EXECUTIVES MAKING MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR WERE MEN. AND THIRTY SEVEN OF THOSE TOP EXECUTIVES WERE WHITE. AN ANALYSIS BY BLOOMBERG NEWS WHICH FIRST REPORTED THE DATA FOUND ONE IN FOUR WHITE MEN AT INTEL WERE IN TOP SALARY BANDS. WHILE LESS THAN 10% OF BLACK EMPLOYEES WERE TOP EARNERS. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO- BASED UPON SOME OF THE MISINFORMATION OUT THERE TO KNOW WHAT THIS BILL IS NOT. THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT PUBLIC EXPOSURE OF FOR SHAMING. THIS MEASURE WILL NOT EXPOSE INFORMATION THAT IS INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE BY BUSINESSES NOR WILL IT IT EXPOSED EMPLOYEES PRIVATE FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC. I'VE EVEN TAKEN THE UNUSUAL STEP OF PROHIBITING A PUBLIC RECORD ACT DISCLOSURE. THE LIMITING A PUBLIC AVAILABILITY OF THE REPORT. IS SIMILAR TO WHAT OCCURS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WITH THE EO ONE FORM WHERE THEY'VE HAD NO ISSUES WHATSOEVER WITH UNTOWARD DISCLOSURE OF THIS DATA IN THE FIFTY PLUS YEARS. SINCE THAT FORM HAS BEEN REQUIRED SO THIS DATA WHAT IT WILL DO IS PROVIDE A BIRD'S-EYE VIEW ON PAY DISPARITIES AN OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION. BUT NOT IN A GRANULAR SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL WAY THE INFORMATION IN THIS REPORT IS NOT ALSO INTENDED TO WIN THAT CONSTITUTE DIRECT EVIDENCE OF A VIOLATION OF THE CALIFORNIA. FAIR PAY ACT WE ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE JOE WHO IS IN JOB A AND COMPARE JOE TO. JANE WHO IS IN JOB BE WHAT THIS DOES IS IT GOES TO THE TOP LINES TO THE BANDS OF EMPLOYMENT. IN A COMPANY AND BY WHAT IT WILL DO. IS IT WILL IDENTIFY. EXACTLY WHAT. CRITERIA AND CLASSIFICATIONS THERE ARE IN A COMPANY AND HOPEFULLY WITH THAT MIRROR BEING PUT IN THE FACE OF THE EMPLOYER THE EMPLOYER WILL RECOGNIZE. WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE IN FACT DISCRIMINATING AND I WOULD SUBMIT THAT PROBABLY MOST OF IT IS IMPLICIT BIAS NOT INTENTIONAL BUT BIASED NONE THE LESS THAT AFFECTS JOB DISCRIMINATION. BY HAVE JESSICA STAND WITH EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES WHO WILL JOIN US REMOTELY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND I BELIEVE- WE ASKED- JENNIFER TO BE OUR ONE SPOKESPERSON SO THAT SHE CAN SPEAK FOR THREE MINUTES ON THIS BILL. BURGER THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON YES- JESSICA'S TENDER IS- ON THE LINE AND- WE WILL NOW MOVE TO HER TESTIMONY. THREE MINUTES. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHEN NUMBER MY NAME IS JESSICA STANDARD AND I'M SENIOR COUNSEL FOR WORKPLACE JUSTICE THE PUBLIC POLICY AT THE RIGHT ADVOCATES WE ARE PROUD CO SPONSORED SB NINE SEVEN THREE. WE NEED TO ENSURE EQUAL PAYMENT NOW MORE CLEAR APPARENT THAN EVER DURING THIS CURRENT HEALTH AND ECONOMIC CRISIS. WHICH IS EXPOSED THE LASTING HARM OF UNEQUAL PAY ON WOMEN AND PARTICULARLY WOMEN OF COLOR. WOMEN AND WORKERS OF COLOR MAKE A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF FRONTLINE ESSENTIAL WORKERS AN EXISTING INEQUALITIES SUCH AS PAY INEQUITY ARE BEING REVEALED AND EXACERBATED AT THIS TIME. A DATA COLLECTION AS CONTEMPLATED UNDER SB NINE SEVEN THREE WILL HELP TO UNCOVER P. DISCRIMINATION WHICH IS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO THE OVERALL GENERATE THE WAGE GAP. AND IT COLLECTIVELY COST CALIFORNIA WOMEN OVER SEVENTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS EACH YEAR. IT ALSO PROMOTES EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT OF OUR STATE ANTI DISCRIMINATION AND EQUAL PAY LAWS AS WELL VOLUNTARY COMPLIANCE BY EMPLOYERS WITH THE LAW. I WANT TO KNOW THE EXTENT STUDY AN ANALYSIS THAT WENT INTO THE FEDERAL PD REPORTING RULE ON WHICH TO BEAT BILL GATES. YOUR GEN FIVE YEARS OF EVALUATION INCLUDING TWO PUBLIC COMMENT PERIODS CONSULTATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND EXPERTS AND A PILOT STUDY TO IDENTIFY THE MOST EFFECTIVE FORM OF DATA. AND THE LEAST BURDENSOME METHOD OF COLLECTION FOR EMPLOYERS YEAH THE EO ONE FORM THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE TO SUBMIT INFORMATION ON. ONE OBSTACLE TO EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT OF THE EQUAL PAY PROTECTIONS IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT PEOPLE PAY IS OFTEN HIDDEN FROM SIGHT. AND IT CAN BE THE RESULT OF UNCONSCIOUS BIASES AS WELL AS HISTORICAL INEQUITIES. AND BECAUSE OF THIS EMPLOYERS THEMSELVES ESPECIALLY IN LARGER COMPANIES MAY NOT EVEN BE AWARE OF GENDER OR RACIAL PAID IT'S VERY BIG THIS WITH. OUR COMPANY. PROCESS AND COLLECTING DATA WILL HELP EMPLOYERS. AND PEOPLE SENATOR JACK THEN. IDENTIFY POTENTIAL WAY DISPARITIES AND PROMPT THEM TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER TO DETERMINE WHETHER EMPLOYEES WERE PERFORMING SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR WORK ARE IN FACT BEING PT COOLEY WHICH THEY MAY BE- AND IF NOT MAKE CHANGES ARE WHERE WE'VE SEEN THAT HAPPEN PUBLICLY. FOR INSTANCE GOING TO KEEP THE BILL COURSE. AWARE OF ANY OCT CORRECTED ME QUESTION TO INCREASE STRUCTURE. I MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO THE RIVER GENDER AND RACIAL WAGE GAP IS THE PHENOMENON OF OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION. WHERE BY WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY CONCENTRATED IN LOWER PAYING JOB. BOTH WITHIN COMPANIES AS WELL AS ACROSS INDUSTRIES AND ONE CONTRIBUTOR TO THAT IS UNCONSCIOUS BIAS SO AS YOU HEARD A LOT OF EMPLOYERS MIGHT NOT EVEN BE AWARE OF THESE TRENDS. OFFICE IN COLLECTING OUR OWN KEY DATA WILL HELP THEM IDENTIFY PATTERNS AND POTENTIALLY CHANGE THEIR RECRUITMENT HIRING AND PROMOTION PRACTICES TO ENSURE. EQUAL REPRESENTATION AT ALL LET ME DOUBLE DROP THEIR COMPANY AND WE SEE MANY BUSINESSES VOLUNTARILY DO THAT. HE DID A QUOTE HIM ALSO PROMOTE EFFICIENT USE OF LIMITED ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES BY OUR STATE ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES BY ALLOWINGTHEM TO IDENTIFY PATTERNS BASED ON RACE GENDER ETHNICITY WITHIN A COMPANY OR ACROSS INDUSTRIES. WHICH WILL THEN HELP THEM TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT AL LIARS DETERMINE IF THERE ARE ANY VIOLATIONS OF OUR EQUAL PAY FOR ANTI DISCRIMINATION LAWS. THE SECOND COMPONENT OF THIS BILL ALLOWING THAT YES EACH ONE FOURTH EQUAL PAY ACT IS CRITICAL TO ENSURING THERE IS ADEQUATE ENFORCEMENT OF THIS IMPORTANT LAW.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATORS BUT HAVING COME OUT FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE- UNFORTUNATELY I RESPECTFULLY POSTED THIS BILL ONCE AGAIN- CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OBVIOUSLY DOES NOT SUPPORT- GENDER OR ANY OTHER PAY INEQUITY IN FACT- CHAMBER WAS PROUD TO WORK WITH SENATOR JACKSON ON HER LANDMARK BILL FROM A T. FEW YEARS AGO SB THREE FIFTY EIGHT WE ACTUALLY SUPPORTED THAT BILL. UP TO STRENGTHENED CALIFORNIA'S EQUAL PAY ACT- WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL WE'VE DISCUSSED AND PREVIOUSLY OVER THE YEARS I'M NOT GOING TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME OUR CONCERN HAS TO DO PRIMARILY WITH THE FACT. THAT WE BELIEVE- THIS REPORTING OF INFORMATION TO ENFORCEMENT AGENCY CREATES A AN IMPRESSION. OF UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION WHEN NINE MAY IN FACT EXIST EXIST THERE ARE. MANY LEGITIMATE REASONS TO HAVE DIFFERENCES IN PAY- BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS EVEN INDIVIDUALS WITH SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR POSITIONS BASED ON EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE- WE THINK. WE ARE CONCERNED PRESIDING THAT INFORMATION TO AN ENFORCEMENT AGENCY LEAVES THE IMPRESSION WITH THAT THERE'S DISCRIMINATION WHEN. IT MAY NOT IN FACT EXIST I DO WANT TO COMMENT VERY BRIEFLY ON WHAT'S NEW IN THIS BILL WHICH IS THE ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING. TO ENFORCE THE EQUAL PAY ACT- WE SPOKE INTO THE AUTHORS OFFICE ABOUT OUR CONCERNS IN THIS REGARD. ANYTIME YOU HAVE TWO DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES AND FORCING THE STAIN BODY OF LAW WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT. A FUSION DIFFERING INTERPRETATIONS. WE APPRECIATE THE LANGUAGE SENATOR PUT IN THE BILL TO SAY THAT ONLY ONE AGENCY WILL INVESTIGATE THE SAME SET OF FACTS. I WERE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TALKING TO THE SENATOR AND HER STAFF ABOUT OUR CONCERNS- BUT THAT'S OUR CONCERN WHEN YOU HAVE TWO DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES AND FORCING THE SAME LAW. WE RAISE THIS ISSUE IN RECENT YEARS- WITH DIFFERENT PROPOSALS TO ALLOW THE LABOR COMMISSIONER TO IT FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT LAW- IN ADDITION TO DTH AND WE EVERY SIMILAR CONCERNS WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES AND FORCING THE SAME BODY OF LAW THAT IT CREATES CONFUSION. AND DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE SENATOR- ON THOSE CONCERNS WITH THE ENFORCEMENT PIECE- BUT- UNFORTUNATELY WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL THANK YOU.

THANK YOU AND I WANT TO THANK A CENTER JACKSON FOR BRINGING THIS BILL BACK AGAIN AND I WAS PROUD TO VOTE FOR IT BEFORE- DIED TODAY I DO I JUST ACKNOWLEDGED- THE OPPOSITION'S TESTIMONY ABOUT DEAL ENFORCEMENT I'M SURE SAID JACKSON WORK ON THAT BUT- I DID FIND A LITTLE STRANGE TO SAY THAT. REPORTING THIS DATA WHICH TO SLOW WOULD REQUIRE EVERY EMPLOYER. WOULD THEN TRIGGER SOMETHING IN RELATION TO THE AGENCY RATE RECOGNIZING ISN'T IT AND FOR SOME AGENCY BUT YET ACTUALLY- SINCE EVERYONE'S REQUIRED TO REPORT A I I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE STIGMA IS FOR REPORTING TO START WITH. SINCE IT IS SOMETHING THAT- WOULD BE HELPFUL BUT WITH THAT- I AM COURAGE AUTHORED CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION WHICH I KNOW SHE WILL- AND I'D BE HAPPY TO MOVE TO BUILT APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN. ANY OTHER COMMENTS SIR YES. CENTER TOMORROW MY SHARE. THANK SENATOR. YEAH I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE SUPPORT THIS TODAY BECAUSE I AM CONCERNED DO STUDENT. THE CHALLENGING ECONOMIC TIMES THAT WE HAVE. HERE THIS IS ANOTHER LAYER OF GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY- FOR BUSINESSES. IN AND I JUST THINK IT'S GOING TO OPEN UP A WHOLE LOT OF- UNJUST LAWSUITS AND- IT'S WERE PYLON. MANY DIFFICULTIES AND MORE REGULATORY BURDENS UPON OUR SMALL BUSINESSES WHICH ARE ALREADY. IF NOT LEAVE IN THE STATE- MANY DOORS HAVE CLOTHES AND WILL CONTINUE TO CLOSE THIS IS AN INAPPROPRIATE- BILL BUT MORE SO I THINK THE TIMING ON THIS IS REALLY BAD SO NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL THIS TIME. THANK YOU SENATOR MORRELL SENATOR JACKSON WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU IN RESPONSE TO THE SMALL BUSINESS ASPECT THIS IS FOR COMPANIES OF A HUNDRED EMPLOYEES ARE MORE- THEY HAVE TO FILL OUT AND HAVE BEEN FOR THE LAST FIFTY YEARS IN THE YEAR ONE FORM. THIS JUST ADDS ANOTHER. ASPECT TO IT TAT THAT ASK COMPANIES TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND SEE WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE VIOLATING THE LAW BY DISCRIMINATING- AND- IT DOESN'T A SANCTION THEM- IF THEY DISCOVER THAT IN FACT THERE ARE THERE ARE. HUGE DISPARITIES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED THE HOPE IS THAT THEY WILL ADDRESS THEM AND- THAT IS THE INTENT OF THIS. LEGISLATION I HAVE CERTAINLY. WORKED WITH THE- THE CHAMBER AND IN THE OPPOSITION AND I THINK WE'VE GOT A- A YOU KNOW I'VE TAKEN AMENDMENTS TO MAKE INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL FOR EXAMPLE- THERE ARE I THINK- YOU KNOW GOOD REASONS. TO ASSIST THESE COMPANIES IN COMPLYING WITH WHAT IS ALREADY THE LAW AND IS MENTIONED. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I HAVE TO SAY IT. THIS IS THE THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL WE'RE PUTTING IT INTO BANDS THIS IS NOT WHAT THEY MAY SAY DE AGGREGATING INFORMATION WE'RE NOT GOING TO COMPARE IT. JODY CHAIN IN A BAND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS TO SEE WHETHER THESE BANDS THE HIGHER ECHELONS THE LOWER ECHELONS. DO IN FACT DISCRIMINATE. ON THE BASIS OF GENDER RACE AND ETHNICITY- SO WITH THAT- THERE ARE- EIGHT YOU KNOW I THINK THE CONCERNS ARE. INACCURATE ARM AND I'M CERTAINLY HAPPY TO TALK FURTHER AND TO CLARIFY WHY I BELIEVE HAVING BOTH AGENCIES IS NOT TO PLEA COULD HAVE- THAT THAT THEY ARE THE GOAL IS TO HAVE THEM WORK. SEAMLESSLY TOGETHER AND IF WE NEED TO. TWEAK THE LEGISLATION TO ARTICULATE THAT I'M CERTAINLY HAPPY TO DO THAT AND WITH THAT I WOULD ASK THE RIFLE. THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PERSISTENCE ON THIS ISSUE I MEAN TO GET TO THE- THE ISSUE IN THE COMMITMENT OF ENSURING EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH THE NEW HAVE I KNOW FOR MANY YEARS AND IT WILL MAKE IT MUCH EASIER TO IDENTIFY THAT GENDER BASED. HEY DISCREPANCIES THAT WE'VE SEEN SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION FROM SENATOR PAN- THE MOTIONS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. PLEASE TURN ON YOUR MICROPHONES TO VOTE. SENATOR HILL HI. UNDER HILL HI CENTER MOREAU WHO CENTER MORALE NO CENTER JACKSON HI INNER JACKSON HI CENTER MITCHELL HI CENTER MITCHELL HI CENTER PAN ALL RIGHT.

CENTER BILL SB NINE NINETY I THINK YOU'RE CONVENIENCE OLOGY AND CHANGES AND WATCHING EVERYONE WITH. FACE MASKS AND EYE GLASSES I AM GIVING THEM FOGGED UP AND ARE BOUNCING AROUND BY TAKE ONE- ONE OR THE OTHER OFF YOU'LL UNDERSTAND. COLLEAGUES A SB NINE NINETY IS A SIMPLE BILL. IT WOULD SUSPEND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB FIVE UNTIL JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO. YOU'VE ALREADY HAD A PRESENTATION ON TO THIS BILL EARLIER SAUL TRIED KEEP THIS BRIEF. WHY SHOULD WE DELAY AB FIVE. THE DYNAMICS DECISION BY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT WAS. IN MY OPINION- NOT GOOD INCOME TAX POLICY OF THE BOAT BRILLO DECISION WAS SATISFACTORY. ADOPTING THE DECISION IN PART AND NOT IN THE HOLE. WAS ALSO BAD INCOME TAX POLICY CARVE OUTS SHOWED PARTIALITY. AB FIVE PENALTY PROVISIONS FOR CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS ENROLLED AGENTS AND CORPORATE TAX ATTORNEYS. ARE TOO ONEROUS CIVIL PENALTIES OF VIOLATION IN ADDITION TO OTHER PENALTIES HAS GOTTEN THE PROFESSIONAL TAX PREPARATION INDUSTRY A FLUTTER. INDUSTRIES NOT CARVED OUT REFLECTED A FORM OF ARBITRARINESS SUPPORT FAVORITISM TO THOSE SELECTED. MANY INNOCENT AND LAW ABIDING CALIFORNIA FREELANCERS WHO ANGLER RECEIVED FORMS TEN NINETY NINE AM I HAVE SEE. LOS THEIR CONTRACTS ONE PUBLISHER IN MY DISTRICT WHO. PAYS BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF BOOKS THAT ARE SOLD WAS TOLD THAT AUTHORS NOW WERE EMPLOYEES AND HAD TO BE COMPENSATED DIFFERENTLY AND SUBSEQUENTLY THEY'VE LEFT MY DISTRICT AND MOVED TO THE STATE OF ARIZONA. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WERE IMPACTED FINANCIALLY EVEN BEFORE THE CORONA VIRUS DEPRESSION CAME ON. CALIFORNIA IN THE NATION LIKE A HEART ATTACK. DURING THE LOCKDOWN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WERE PREVENTED FROM PERFORMING THEIR CUSTOMARY SERVICES WHILE SHELTERING IN PLACE. IN THEIR HOMES WHERE MANY HAVE BEEN WORKING TRADITIONALLY FOR DECADES. AB FIVE SAID THAT GIG ECONOMY PARTICIPANTS WERE NOT WELCOME TO THE STATE. WHERE MAYBE TO GET GET KHANOM EVEN STARTED. AND THE CORONAVIRUS DEPRESSION HAS CLEARLY SHOWN THAT CERTAIN PLATFORMS ARE NOT SUITED FOR AN EMPLOYEE EMPLOYER RELATIONSHIP. WHEN UBER AND LIFT- CAME ABOUT THE THEY WERE THEY WERE BASICALLY THEY ARE BASICALLY MATCHMAKERS PAIRING UP INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD TIME AND A CERTIFIED SAFE VEHICLE WITH OTHERS NEEDING TO RUN AN ERRAND OR MEET UP WITH SOMEONE AT AN EVENT. AND BEING PAID A MODEST FEE. THEY PROVIDED AN OUTCOME BUT NEVER UNDER THE CONTROL OF AN EMPLOYER. BUT THE MESSAGES BEEN RECEIVED AS REFERRED THIS WEEK. THERE'S A PERCEPTION AND IT BECOMES REALITY AND IT APPEARS TO MANY THAT SACRAMENTO IS ANTI BUSINESS ANTI ENTREPRENEUR ANTI PART TIME. IN THAT WERE ATTACKING RESIDENTS WHO WERE TRYING TO EARN A LITTLE EXTRA INCOME IN ORDER TO MAKE ENDS MEET PAY THE RENT OR HAVE ENOUGH FUNDS TO TAKE A VACATION. AND I KNOW WE'VE ALL RECEIVED PLENTY OF PHONE CALLS AND LETTERS AND EMAILS. ON THIS PARTICULAR BILL. BUT THE MESSAGE CAME AT THE WRONG TIME CALIFORNIANS IT NEEDS SOME RELIEF. CONSEQUENTLY LET'S HOLD OFF ON IMPLEMENTING AB FIVE UNTIL EVERYONE GETS THROUGH THIS COVERT NINETEEN EPISODE AND THE RESULTING DEPRESSION. CENTER JACKSON SAID IT REALLY WELL LET'S TRY TO FIND THE SWEET SPOT. LET'S SHOW THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY THAT WE HEARD THERE PLEASE AND EMPATHIZE WITH THEIR PLIGHT. AND IN THE INTERIM LET'S PERFORM SOME BETTER SCHOLARSHIP ON HOW TO DETERMINE. WHO IS A COMMON LAMPLEY. AND WHO IS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. THE STANDARD SHOULD APPLY TO ALL AS IT HAS FOR DECADES UNDER THE INTRO REVENUE SERVICES RULES AND SCRUTINY. THERE IS A CRITERIA ME I WRESTLE MAKE SURE YOU'RE AN EMPLOYEE IF YOU ARE AN EMPLOYEE BECAUSE THEY WANT THE FIGHT TO WITH HELD. ME WITH THE PAYROLL TAXES JUST AS MUCH AS THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD DOES. LET'S PUT THE CPA'S IN THE EMERALD AGENTS IN THE TAX ATTORNEYS TO THE TASK. WAS ASKED BY DEL WHICH IS A CALIFORNIA TAX PUBLISHER- THAT THE- THIRTY YEARS AGO I WENT TO THEIR ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON. CALIFORNIA INCOME TAX LET'S PUT THEM TO THE TASK LET'S FIX THIS BLOODY BE FIVE. AND PUT. IT ON THE PAUSE BUTTON. AND MAKE IT FAIR AND EQUITABLE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. IT'S THEIR WORK PRODUCT THAT GENERATES THE INCOME THAT PAYS ARE. ROLL CHECKS WE SHOULD BE MORE SENSITIVE TO OUR CONSTITUENTS SO COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE ON SB NINE NINETY. THANK YOU SENATOR MORE LOCK. IS THERE ANYONE IN FORTY TWO OR THREE WHO WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. OF SB NINE NINETY I NOTICED THAT THERE ARE NO WITNESSES THAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED.

WELL I DON'T KNOW CENTER MORALE OF MANY PHONE CALLS AND- COMMUNICATIONS YOU RECEIVE BUT AFTER SESSION MAYBE FIVE WAS CERTAINLY. A HIGH UP THE LAST PROBABLY AT THE HIGHEST IN A CONTINUES TO GET- LOTS OF MEDIA ATTENTION AND- BLOOD TO LETTERS TO THE EDITOR IN FACT THE LOCAL PAPER THE ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER THE- IMPACT ENDORSED SB NINE NINETY AS- A SOLUTION TO TRY AND- FIX THIS IMBALANCE WE'VE WE'VE TOLD A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT. IN THEIR LEGAL JUSTIFIABLE INDEPENDENT CONTRACT RELATIONSHIPS- WERE WERE NO LONGER AT THIS THIS BILL CAST A WIDE NET AND CAUGHT A LOT OF PEOPLE IN IT YOU KNOW ALLOWING FREELANCE WRITERS WANTED TO THIRTY FIVE ARTICLES- IN A YEAR THAT CERTAINLY- WIPED OUT A LOT OF. FREELANCERS AND SO THE UNITED LIKE PARK TELL STORIES FOR A LONG TIME BUT ALL ALL JUST UP THERE. THANK YOU SENATOR MERLE- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE HAPPY TO ADD WILL. MISTER THANK YOU FOR HEARING THE BILL I REALLY APPRECIATED IT HAS BEEN- A MAJOR SOURCE OF COMMUNICATIONS WITH MY DISTRICT OFFICE AND SO. WE TRIED TO REACT BUT- I TRIED I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR NOT JUST CALL ME UP AND SAY AND FORGET IT. IT'S OUR PRESHEAF THAT. THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD ME IRAQ SHOULD GO AFTER THE ABUSERS. WE WERE VERY CAREFUL WHEN I PRACTICE TO MAKE SURE THAT. PAMELA BOYS WERE COMMON LAW PLEASE AND IF YOU WERE GONNA GO THE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR OUT YOU HAD BETTER BE ABLE TO MEET ALL THE FACTORS- SO THAT MY CLIENTS WITH DOES NOT. HAVE AN INTERESTING LETTER TO EXPLAIN WHY THEY HAD TO PAY THREE YEARS OF BACK PHICHIT TAXES BUT HAD TO PAY BOTH THE EMPLOYEE AND THE EMPLOYER PORTION AT 50% TIMES THE AMOUNT PAID. THAT COULD BE A PRETTY SIZEABLE. BILL FOR A BUSINESS TO HAVE TO TAKE ON. AND WHO WE SHOULD GO AFTER THE VIOLATORS LIKE DYNAMAX DYNAMICS WAS. AGGRESSIVE TO THE MAX AND SO. I REMEMBER UPSET THAT A COMPANY WOULD GO AS FAR AS THEY DID IN TRYING TO RECLASSIFY EMPLOYEES TO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. AND MAYBE WE OUGHT TO FIND MORE FUNDING SAID A TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET TO ENFORCE AB FIVE MEMBER ID GIVE THAT MONEY THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. AND DEAL WITH THE PERPETRATORS BETTER NOT PLAYING BY THE RULES IN AND MAKING IT UNFAIR FOR THOSE THAT ARE SO WITH THAT I. MATURED A BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD. SUSPEND AB FIVE FOR A TELL TELL JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND TAKE A HARDER LOOK ON WHAT'S FAIR FOR EVERYBODY. THAT WERE THAT THAT IT'S- HORIZONTAL NOT VERTICAL EVERYBODY SHOULD BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE INDEPENDENT. OR WHETHER THERE ARE COMMON MOM PLAY IT SHOULDN'T BE WHETHER YOU- WORK- FOR TRAVEL AGENTS OR WHETHER YOU DON'T. THAT'S BAD LAW AND SO THEREFORE- I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE ON SENATE BILL NINE NINETY THANK YOU SENATOR MORE LUCK IN AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL- HERE LIKE YOU AND YOUR CO AUTHORS- I WANT TO REVISIT AB FIVE. THEY COME UP WITH A SOLUTION THAT REALLY WORKS FOR CALIFORNIA AND LIKE YOU I'M VERY CONCERNED THAT THE CURRENT VERSION OF LAW CREATES. MANY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT NEED- I THINK IMMEDIATE REFORM AND THAT'S WHY. UNFORTUNATELY I WILL NOT. SUPPORTING THE BILL OF THESE I THINK WE CAN DO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE NECESSARY IMMEDIATELY AND TAKE CARE OF THAT TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS OR- LOOKING TO THE LEADERSHIP THIS IS THE LEGISLATURE FOR LEADERSHIP AND I THINK WE NEED TO RESPOND NOW WITH MEANINGFUL REFORMS. AND I DON'T THINK SO SPENDING AB FIVE WHAT WILL GET US THERE SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT I HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK. TOGETHER ON SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS AS WE GO FORWARD TO IMPROVE AB FIVE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR BRINGING FORWARD SENATOR MORE LUCK AND WE DO HAVE A MOTION FROM. SENATOR MOREAU.

SENATOR MONEY NICE TO USE IT IN THERE SB ELEVEN OO TO PLEASE. COME FORWARD. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. HERE I GO YOU JUST- CAN GO FROM THERE. IN THE YOU MAY PRESENT AS BE ELEVEN OH TWO AND THANK YOU FOR A AGAIN YOUR PATIENCE TODAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS GOOD EVENING. LAST YEAR MORE THAN TWENTY THREE THOUSAND FOREIGN FARMWORKERS WERE IMPORTED BY ROUGHLY ONE HUNDRED CALIFORNIA GROWERS AND FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS UNDER THE AGE TO A FEDERAL VISA PROGRAM. THIS NUMBER HAS BEEN INCREASING ANNUALLY. FOR THOSE OF YOU UNFAMILIAR WITH H. TO A PROGRAM IT HAS MANY OF THE SAME PROVISIONS AND PROBLEMS AT THE INFAMOUS FOR SERRA PROGRAM HAD. WHICH WAS TERMINATED BECAUSE OF SYSTEMIC LABOR HOUSING IN WAGE ABUSES. THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION THE FEDERAL MINISTRATION HAS MADE AN EXCEPTION. TO ITS STRICT BORDER CLOSURE POLICY. FOR H. TO A WORKERS RECOGNIZING THAT THEY ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS NOW DURING THE COVERT NINETEEN CRISIS. H. TO A FARM WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA- ARE LARGELY RECRUITED IN MEXICO ARE TIED TO A SINGLE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYER WHO MUST PROVIDE THEM WITH HOUSING MEALS AND TRANSPORTATION TO WORK SITES. MANY H. TO A WORKERS HAVE NEVER BEEN TO CALIFORNIA BEFORE AND ARE BELIEVED TO NEITHER SPEAK NOR READ ENGLISH. IF THEY'RE FIRED FOR ANY REASON THEY'RE SUBJECT TO IMMEDIATE DEPORTATION WHICH IS A POWERFUL POWERFUL DISINCENTIVE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT ANY ABUSIVE WORKPLACE CONDITIONS THEY MAY BE SUBJECTED TO. THE COMMITTEE'S BEEN PROVIDED EVIDENCE OF CURRENT ABUSES IN THIS PROGRAM. MANY OF THESE ABUSES ARE ALSO VIOLATIONS OF CALIFORNIA LOS WHICH EACH TO A FARMWORKERS GENERALLY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT. BECAUSE NEITHER THE US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR NOR THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT WHO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM REQUIRE WORKERS TO BE TOLD OF THE SUBSTANTIAL BODY OF CALIFORNIA LAWS THAT PROVIDE PROTECTIONS GREATER THAN THE FEDERAL H. TO A PROGRAM. SB ELEVEN- TO FILL SAID INFORMATION GAP BY REQUIRING EACH TO EMPLOYERS TO PROVIDE EACH TO A FARMWORKERS ON THEIR FIRST DAY OF WORK WITH A SHORT COMPREHENSIVE WRITTEN SUMMARY OF KEY LABOR HOUSING HEALTH AND SAFETY AND OTHER CALIFORNIA LAWS IN SPANISH AND IF REQUESTED IN ENGLISH. THIS WOULD INCLUDE NOTICE OF ANY EMERGENCY DECLARATIONS INCLUDED INCLUDING COVERT NINETEEN WILD FIRE DANGER OR OTHER POTENTIAL HEALTH RISKS. THE BILL DIRECTS THE LABOR COMMISSIONER TO DEVELOP A TEMPLATE CONTAINING THIS SUMMARY INTO PROVIDED ON THE WEBSITE FOR H. TO EMPLOYERS TO USED TO COMPLY WITH THESE NEW DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. RECENT AMENDMENTS HAVE ADDED A REQUIREMENT THAT THE DISCLOSURE INCLUDE INFORMATION ABOUT CURRENT STATE OR FEDERAL DISASTER OR EMERGENCY DECLARATIONS AND THAT AGE TO A WORKERS ARE PROTECTED FROM REALIATION FOR RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT THESE DECLARATIONS REQUIREMENTS OR RECOMMENDATIONS. SB ELEVEN- TO CREATE A SAFER LEGALLY COMPLIANT WORKPLACE FOR H. TO A FARMWORKERS AND REDUCES ANY INCENTIVE UNSCRUPULOUS EMPLOYERS MAY HAVE TO HIRE WORKERS WHOM THEY CAN UNDER PAYING IN MYSTERY BECAUSE THE WORKERS DO NOT UNDERSTAND THEIR RIGHTS OR HOW DO ENFORCEMENT. TODAY MISTER CHAIR I HAVE WITH ME- REMOTELY TO WITNESSES MARK SCHACHT INSTANT THE ARISE BOTH WITH THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. THROUGH THE CHAIR I'D LIKE TO INVITE THE TESTIMONY OF MARK SHOPS FIRST AND THEN FOLLOWED BY CYNTHIA RICE. THANK YOU SENATOR MINE AND- I THINK THAT- WE WILL MOVE NOW TO TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT- SO MARK SHOT IF YOU ARE- YOU JUST CALLED IN I UNDERSTAND AND SO YOU WILL BEGIN. TO TESTIMONY PLEASE PLEASE PRETTY. YEAH THANK YOU AND WE HAVE A TOTAL OF THREE MINUTES FOR THE TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT. OF THAT SINCE YOU'RE RIGHT WHY ARE GONNA DIVIDED IN HALF- SB ELEVEN OH TWO ADDRESSES THE PROBLEM OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF FOREIGN CONTRACT FARMWORKERS ENTERING CALIFORNIA UNDER FEDERAL JOB ORDERS THAT OFTEN INCLUDE TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT ARE LEGAL UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW. WE KNOW STATE AGENCY CHARGED WITH PROVIDING BALL BALL WORKERS BUT A COMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY OF THE WHITE. ACTIONS UNDER STATE LAW THIS BILL HAS BEEN DRAFTED WITH THAT I'D TO PROVIDING EACH TO A FARMWORKERS WITH USEFUL INFORMATION THAT YOU KNOW WHAT THE LAW REQUIRES THE BECAUSE- THIS GOES SEVEN WRITING. FOR EXAMPLE NO LAW REQUIRES STATES TO A FARMWORKERS TO BE INFORMED. THAT IF THEY'RE INJURED ON THE JOB THEY MUST BE GIVEN A WORKERS COMP CLAIMS FORM WITHIN ONE DAY. FOR THEIR AFFAIR REASONABLY SUSPECTED TO HAVE BEEN EXPOSED PESTICIDES THEY MUST BE GIVEN PROPER APPLICATION TO A MEDICAL FACILITY. OR THAT EVERY WORK SITE.

GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- THIS IS BRIAN LITTLE OF CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION- RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING YOUR OPPOSITION TO SB ELEVEN OH TWO. THIS BILL IN A TWO IS NOT NECESSARY BECAUSE THE DISCLOSURES THAT REQUIRES A LARGE WE ALREADY COVERED BY OTHER CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRES THE SAME DISCLOSURES TO OTHER OUR CULTURAL WORKERS. AS WELL AS H. TO A PROGRAM LIKE ELECTIONS REQUIRE THE DISCLOSURE OF THE THINGS THAT IS BELOW THE TWO WOULD REQUIRE TWO. EIGHT H. TO A WORKERS WHEN THEY COME IN THE COUNTRY ON THE FIRST DY OF WORK- THERE ALSO ARE OTHER ISSUES THAT WE HAVE WITH US BELOW THE NO TWO FOR EXAMPLE. OF THE DISCLOSURE THAT IT WOULD HAVE THE LABOR COMMISSIONER CLEAN UP WHAT FOR AND REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO. DISCLOSED WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPATIBILITY OF TRANSPORTATION TIME IF WE MISS STATE LAW THE MOTION ALL TRANSPORTATION KILEY COMPATIBLE IS NOT ACCURATE- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COURT CASES THAT ARE AND HAVE BEEN PENDING IN RECENT YEARS. AND THAT THE ISSUE IS- IS COMPLEX SAY THE VERY LEAST. AND THEN THE LABOR COMMISSIONER EMPLOYERS DISCLOSE BUT LAW INCORRECTLY TO WORKERS WILL BE. OF NO PARTICULAR USED ANYMORE. OKAY WE CAN ARE WE WOULD RESPECTFUL REQUEST OPPOSITION TO THE- ELEVEN A TWO. OKAY YOU FOR THE ARE. BY. THERE ARE THERE ANY OTHER. YOUR MICROPHONE CHEN. MAKE YOUR MODERATOR ARE THERE ANY OTHER SPEAKERS. YES WE DO HAVE FROM THE LINE OF A ONE SIX NINE OKAY THE- IF YOU WANT TO SPEAK WITHOUT ONE SIXTY NINE YOUR LINE IS OPEN YOU PLEASE GO AHEAD. MAYBE ALIGN THEM YOU. ONE OF THE THINGS. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON MATTHEW WHILE WESTERN GROWERS ASSOCIATION COLLEGE EYES FOR- THE PHONE ISSUES- THIS EVENING WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT TODAY- WE REMAIN RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO SB ELEVEN OH TWO BECAUSE IT LARGELY REQUIRES CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS TO FURNISH A DUPLICATE DUPLICATE AT SCHOOL YOUR TWO WEEKS TO EMPLOYEES. REGARDING EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW THE NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT PROPOSED BY THE BILL IS UNNECESSARY BECAUSE TWO EMPLOYEES ARE ALREADY AFFORDED THE SAME RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL LAW AND DOMESTIC. AT WILL EAT. FAST EIGHT EMPLOY ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THEM FROM I WITHIN EACH CLICK ON ITSELF. OR BY OTHER NOTIFICATION. UNDER CALIFORNIA STATE LAW. THEY ARE DEPORTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT EMPLOYERS ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A TO EMPLOYEES WITH THEIR BRITAIN TOPIC AT EACH DELAY. A CONTRACT BY THE FIRST DAY OF WORK IN THEIR NATIVE LANGUAGE THAT'S CURRENT LAW AND THAT INCLUDES THINGS LIKE RATE OF PAY. OVER TIME. PATIENT ARE ALSO INFORMATION ABOUT THE NEED FOR THE EMPLOYER TO PROVIDE HOUSING FREE OF CHARGE AND WHEN THEY CANNOT COMMUTE HOME ON A DAILY BASIS. BUT ALTERNATE CONCERNED ABOUT THE NEW PROVISION THAT WAS RECENTLY ADDED TO THE BILL THAT WOULD REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO PROVIDE THE EMPLOYEES WITH ADDITIONAL SPECIFIED INFORMATION DURING OUR STATE. OR FEDERAL EMERGENCY- WE OF COURSE PRIOR TO EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND SAFETY. AND TO THAT END WE CONTINUE TO WORK TO ENSURE THOSE BEST PRACTICES AND SAFETY MECHANISMS FRONT TIRE WORKFORCE. HOWEVER WE ARE. CONCERNED THAT AN EMPLOYER INADVERTENTLY LEAVING SOMETHING OUT OF THIS NEWLY PROPOSED NOTIFICATION WILL CREATE POTENTIAL LIABILITY. IT IS FOR THESE REASONS AMONG OTHERS THAT WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE. DEATH THANK YOU THANK YOU DROUGHT ONE. AND WE DO HAVE LINE TO NINETY EIGHT NINE TWO NINE EIGHT. ONE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI GOOD EVENING- CHURN MEMBERS ARE THIS IS BY COMO OR WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF BLIND YOUR GROWERS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL FOR THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED. I WANT TO JUST MAKE THE COMMITTEE AWARE THAT WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT EMERGENCY DECLARATIONS. YOU COULD POTENTIALLY BE GOING BACK TO OLD ALL DECLARATIONS YOU'RE STILL IN FACT PRINCES LOTS OF TWO FIRES IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN. MANY OF THOSE STONE FFECT PROPRIETY OF REASONS AND WHICH STOPPED IT JUST DOES NECESSARY ARE PROVIDES NO SERVICES WHATSOEVER TO EMPLOYEES THANK YOU VERY MUCH YEAH NO ABOUT YOU'VE EXCEEDED THE TIME THE THREE MINUTES ON OPPOSITION SO. NEXT THE NEXT CALLER PLEASE. AT THIS TIME THERE IS NO ONE ELSE Q. THANK YOU MODERATE OR CAN YOU PLEASE GIVE ME. THE KID WOULD YOU PLEASE OPEN THE LINES AND CALL THE OPPOSITION WITNESSES- ONE MORE TIME. IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION SB ONE ONE ZERO TWO. ONE ZERO. ONE ZERO. IN THERE YOU KNOW WANTING TO AT THE MOMENT THANK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MODERATOR APPRECIATE THAT AND- DO WE WILL NOW BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO THE MEMBERS AND I WANT TO THANK THE OPPOSITION AND SUPPORT WITNESSES FOR THAT- OTHER ANY QUESTIONS OF THE- MEDIA SENATOR PAM. THANK YOU SIR MINING- FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD THE OPPOSITION HAS MADE MENTION ABOUT DUPLICATION- BUT ALSO THE SAME TIME CONCERNED THAT LIABILITY BECAUSE ONE MIGHT LEAVE SOMETHING OUT FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE YOU CAN CLARIFY- A DOCUMENT THAT MEETS ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BILL WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE DEVELOPED BY THE LABOR COMMISSION OR- THAT THEN COULD BE THAT WOULD ENSURE THAT EMPLOYER WOULD HAVE MET ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS. BILL IN TERMS OF THE DISCLOSURES THAT NEED TO BE MADE IS THAT CORRECT ARE DRIED IT IS CORRECT AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS INCLUDING THAT ONE SO GOING TO THE BACK END- NO PENALTIES THE CREW THERE'S A RIGHT TO GET IT RIGHT- IF THERE'S A FAILURE TO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE NOTIFICATIONS IT DOESN'T IMMEDIATELY RESULT IN A FINE AND IF AFTER THIRTY DAYS IT HASN'T BEEN CURED. THEN NO MATTER HOW MANY WORKERS ARE AFFECTED THE FIRST FINE IS ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS IT'S NOMINAL BUT LET ME ADDRESS THIS ISSUE OF DUPLICATION BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE THE OPPOSITION STRONGEST ARGUMENT AND THAT'S WHERE WE DON'T SEE EYE TO EYE ON THIS FEDERAL LAW FOR EXAMPLE SAYS. IN H. TO A GUEST WORKER CANNOT HAVE GUESTS AT WHERE THEY'RE BEING HOUSED CALIFORNIA LAUNDER CALIFORNIA TENANT LAW. EXPLICITLY IN BY COURT DECISION RECOGNIZES THE RIGHT OF THE FARM WORKER TO HAVE GUESTS INTO THEIR HOME EVEN IF THE PROPERTIES OWNED BY BY A GROWER THEY ARE THE TENANT. THEY'RE PROTECTED BY CALIFORNIA LAW THAT'S ONE AREA. WHERE WE HAVE A DISTINCTION WITH FEDERAL LAW THE FEDERAL EACH TO ANY WARNINGS TALK ABOUT THE RIGHT TO OVERTIME PAY. CALIFORNIA REQUIRES NOT JUST YOU'RE ENTITLED TO OVERTIME PAY BUT HOW THAT WOULD WORK HOW WOULD BE CALCULATED AFTER EIGHT AND A HALF HOURS AND WHAT THAT RATE WOULD BE. AFTER A FORTY HOUR WEEK OF TIME AND A HALF. SPECIFYING THE RATE THEY ALSO TAKE EXCEPTION TO THE ISSUE ON THE DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY. THAT SOMETHING I THINK WE CAN CERTAINLY WORK OUT THE INTENT. IS TO GIVE A GUEST WORKER NOTICE OF ANY DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY THAT IS REAL AND PRESENT IN COULD AFFECT THEIR HEALTH AND SAFETY. CODE NINETEEN BEING A PRIME EXAMPLE. WILD FIRES BURNING IN AN AREA WHERE THERE'S AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION COULD AFFECT AIR QUALITY- PESTICIDE APPLICATIONS- A LEAVE THAT ONE OFF THE TABLE BECAUSE THAT WOULDN'T BE A DECLARATION OF A STATE OF EMERGENCY BUT- FIRES COVERT NINETEEN. SO WE'VE HAD THIS GROUP OF WORKERS DECLARED ESSENTIAL. AND I WILL SAY MANY GROWERS HAVE TAKEN EXTRAORDINARY STEPS TO PROVIDE P. P. IAN DISTANCING ETCETERA IT CAME A LITTLE LATE IN MY VIEW AND NOW IN OUR DISTRICT. THAT I REPRESENT 80% OF ALL COVERT NINETEEN POSITIVE TESTS ARE IN TWO ZIP CODES IN SALINAS. POPULATED PRIMARILY BY FARMWORKERS SO. IT'S A HUGE PROBLEM AND IF YOU'RE BEING ASKED TO WORK IN A RISKY ENVIRONMENT YOU SHOULD MINIMALLY HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE MADE AWARE OF THAT AND MAKE A CHOICE FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY IF YOU WANT TO ASSUME THAT RISK. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IT GOES BEYOND FEDERAL PROTECTIONS BUT WE WOULD ALLOW. THE DELIVERY OF THAT NOTICE TO BE BLENDED IN OTHER WORDS IT COULD BE A SINGLE DOCUMENT. OKAY SO THAT'S A EXTREMELY HELPFUL I THAT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'LL BE WORKING AT THE OPPOSITION TO CLARIFY SOME OF THESE ISSUES LIKE EMERGENCIES-AND SO FORTH- BUTTON IT'S VERY IMPORTANT I THINK WORKERS KNOW WHAT THE RATES ARE AND THAT THEY'RE DISCLOSED TO THEM. UP FRONT- SO THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH AND I'D BE HAPPY TO PLEASE ENTER PAN I DO WANT TO GO BACK SLIGHTLY BECAUSE WE DID GO FROM THE TESTIMONY AND STAY IN OPPOSITION. TO THAN TO THE PHONE AND DID NOT ADDRESS ANY TESTIMONY PUBLIC COMMENTS THAT WERE IN THIS ROOM OR IN TWENTY FORTY SHOWS OR ANYONE IN FORTY TWO OR THREE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK. IN OPPOSITION TO SB ELEVEN TO. GIVE ALL AGES MISTER CHAIR BENEFIT COME AFTER THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN OPPOSITION JUST VERY BRIEFLY WANTED TO POINT OUT THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRES EVERY EMPLOYER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO THE WAGE THEFT PREVENTION ACT TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE NOTICE REGARDING THAT NATURAL EMERGENCIES AND WE DON'T THINK THAT'S NECESSARILY NECESSARY FOR EVERY EMPLOYER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO THAT IF THE CONCERN IS ABOUT EACH TO A WORKERS. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN FORTY TWO OR THREE WISHING TO SPEAK. TO THIS ITEM- MOVING TO ROOM TWENTY FORTY ANYONE WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION SB ELEVEN OH TWO IN TWENTY FORTY SEEN NO ONE READ IT BACK NOW FOR THE FURTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM. THE COMMITTEE WE DO HAVE A MOTION FROM SENATOR PAN- SENATOR MONEY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE- I THINK THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR INDULGENCE I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR NEAR STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS- AND AGAIN THIS IS. PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHO IN SOME SECTORS ARE CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL BUT EXPENDABLE WE THANK THEY'RE ESSENTIAL AND SHOULD BE PUT. THIS IS A MINOR STEP OF. SHARED RESPONSIBILITY I URGE AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU SENATOR MINE AND APPRECIATE YOUR WORKING WITH OUR STAFF AND THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ON THE AMENDMENTS- IN THIS REPORT. BILL IS. NEEDED AND IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE. AND THAT THE NEEDED INFORMATION WITHOUT BEING A IT'S NOT A MAJOR BURDEN TO EMPLOYERS I DON'T BELIEVE IN AND IT CAN BE ADDED TO EXISTING REQUIREMENTS. THAT ANY CHALLENGER PROBLEMS WITH THANK YOU. FOR THAT AND THANK YOU FOR SPONSORS AS WELL IN THAT SO WE HAD TO HAVE A MOTION FROM OF THE CENTRE PAN PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SENATORS PLEASE TURN ON YOUR MICROPHONE IN ORDER TO VOTE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS SENATOR HILL HI. SENATOR HILL HI SENATOR MOREAU NO. SENATOR MORALE NO SENATOR JACKSON HI. SENATOR JACKSON HI SENATOR MITCHELL HI. SENATOR MITCHELL HI SENATOR PAN. UNDER PAN HI THE BILL HAS FOUR VOTES IT IS OUT THANK YOU SENATOR MONEY. VERY MUCH AND I'M SORRY BUT WE CAN'T GO OUT OF ORDER TODAY. FOR THE BILL I APOLOGIZE I DID CHECK WHILE YOU WERE STANDING THERE ARE HOPING THAT IT WOULD BE A DIFFERENT OUTCOME BUT BECAUSE OF THE WITNESSES IN THE TIMING AND THE TELEPHONES THAT'S THE CHALLENGE I UNDERSTAND. AND TO QUOTE. SOMEONE WHO I WON'T NAME I'LL BE BACK. MOVING THE HOW DO SENATE BILL ELEVEN OH THREE SENATOR HER TADO WELCOME. WE'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE HAVE. WELCOME SENATOR DAUGHTER IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU THEN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TODAY YOU MAY PRESENT BILL- THIS BE ELEVEN OH THREE. WELL GOOD EVENING AT THANK YOU AND- I YOU KNOW I REALLY WANT TO START OFF BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS REFLECTED ON PAGE FOUR OF THE ANALYSIS. A MANY OF YOU KNOW ABOUT THE ECONOMIC CHALLENGES THAT PEOPLE OF MY SENATE-DISTRICT HAVE FACED OVER THE YEARS. AND MANY OF YOU ALSO KNOW ABOUT THE ECONOMIC CHALLENGES THAT PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FIFTEEN DUE TO COORDINATE. TO DISCOVER NINETEEN INDUCED DEPRESSION. IF THERE IS ONE THING BUT I HATE POVERTY IS IT. I HAVE LIVED THROUGH IT AND WE HAVE WITNESSED IT WAY TOO OFTEN. I HAVE WITNESSED HELP QUICKLY FAMILY CAN GO FROM. THE MIDDLE CLASS TO BEING HOMELESS. MY FAMILY LIKE MANY OTHERS CAME TO THIS GREAT NATION AND THIS GREAT STATE SEARCHING FOR THE AMERICAN DREAM. THE MAN THE AMERICAN DREAM OR MORE SPECIFICALLY WHAT I LIKE TO REFER TO AS THE CALIFORNIA DREAM. NEEDS TO BE AVAILABLE TO ALL WALKS OF LIFE. IT SHOULD NOT DISCRIMINATE DISCRIMINATE IN ANYWAY. AND I AM HERE TODAY TO INTRODUCE A BILL WITH THE FRAMEWORK THAT ONCE HELPED MY FAMILY MOVE OUT OF POVERTY AND I KNOW THAT IT WILL DO THE SAME. FOR ALL THOSE THAT NEED AND DESIRE IT. SB ELEVEN ZERO THREE. IS A BILL THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CHANCELLOR OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO SUPPORT LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS COMPLETE WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAMS. THE BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE BOARD TO DEVELOP ADDITIONAL EMPLOYMENT PARTNERSHIPS TO ADDRESS DISPLACEMENT OF WORKERS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY INCLUDING FARMWORKERS. DISCONNECTED YOUTH AND YOUTH AT RISK OF DISCONNECTION FROM EMPLOYMENT. DURING THIS TIME IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE PRO ACTIVELY ADDRESS UNEMPLOYMENT AMONG OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. WITH REAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE DIVERSITY OF OUR WORKFORCE INCLUSIVITY OF ALL. WE LEARNED FROM OUR LAST RECESSION THAT MULTIPLE COMMUNITIES ARE THE FIRST TO BECOME UNEMPLOYED. FOR EXAMPLE YOUNG ADULTS WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY ECONOMICALLY IMPACTED BY THE GREAT RECESSION DUETO THEIR LACK OF WORK EXPERIENCE AND LOWER LEVEL OF SKILL ATTAINMENT. AND IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AUTOMATION CONTINUES TO DISPLACE KEY WORKFORCE POPULATIONS LIKE AGRICULTURAL WORKERS. WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAMS ALSO HAVE A PROVEN IMPACT ON IMPROVING UPWARD MOBILITY AND ALSO INCREASING OPPORTUNITIES FOR CHILDREN LIVING IN POVERTY WHEN THEY BECOME ADULTS. IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE LIFTING CHILDREN AND FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY TASK FORCED UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES REPORTED TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT THEIR PRIORITY RECOMMENDATION WAS TO FUND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FOR LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS. TO COMPLETE HIGH SKILL AND OCCASIONAL JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS. HOWEVER ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND PARTICULARLY IN THE ROLE CENTRAL VALLEY. MANY PARTICIPANTS ARE NOT ABLE TO COMPLETE THE JOB TRAINING PROGRAM DUE TO A LACK OF AFFORDABLE TRANSPORTATION OR DUE TO A LACK OF AFFORDABLE CHILD CARE. THIS BILL AROSE FROM CONVERSATIONS I'VE HAD WITH SINGLE MOTHERS AND FAMILIES FROM ACROSS THE STATE STRUGGLING TO PURCHASE BASIC NEEDS LIKE BABY FORMULA. FOR THEIR INFANT CHILDREN. A CHILD A STORY THAT IS TOO FAMILIAR IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. OR FROM A CONVERSATION THAT I HD RECENTLY AT THE BEGINNING OF YEAR WITH FARMWORKERS ON THE BERRY YEARS WITHIN OUR OWN SYSTEM TO KEEP THEM FROM UPWARD MOBILITY OPPORTUNITIES. AND I HAVE THREE WITNESSES TODAY JOINING US REMOTELY BETTER CARE TO ALSO TESTIFY. I BELIEVE WE HAVE CONWAY COLLIS WITH THE GRACE INSTITUTE AND ALL MY A FARM WORKER- FROM MY HOME TOWN OF THE CITY OF SINGER. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR CHILDREN I THINK WE HAVE- CON WE CALL THIS IS THE ONLY PERSON ON THE LINE AT THIS POINT OKAY. BUT WE WILL WAIT AND WE WILL ALLOW THREE MINUTES FOR TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT FROM YOUR WITNESSES. SELECT A COLLEGE FOR YOU THERE THANK. I AM THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS- WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT HAVE PROVEN IMPACT BUT BUT THE PLAIN FACT IS. PEOPLE CAN ONLY COMPLETE AND WHEN THEY GOT RELIABLE ACCESS TO CHILD CARE TO TRANSPORTATION STABLE HOUSING THAT THAT'S BOTH OBVIOUS BUT IT'S ALSO BACKED UP BY VERY COMPELLING DATA. THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THE LACK OF THIS BASIC SUPPORT IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF LOW INCOME PARTICIPANTS IN TRAINING PROGRAMS DROPPING OUT IT'S NOT A LACK OF COMMITMENT OF ABILITY IT'S A LACK OF VERY BASIC SUPPORT. THE NEED FOR THIS LEGISLATION WAS BROUGHT TO THE STATE CHILD AND FAMILY POVERTY TASK FORCE WHICH I CO CHAIRED. BY THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE STATE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD IT WAS PRESENTED AS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT MEASURE THAT WE COULD TAKE TO INCREASE GRADUATION RATES OF LOW INCOME CALIFORNIA'S. IT HELPS ENSURE THE DISCONNECTED. ADDITIONAL AID YOU MARGINALIZE WORKERS LIKE FARMWORKERS ARE NOT LEFT BEHIND BOTTOM LINE. SB ELEVEN OH THREE HELPS TO PROVIDE A PATHWAY TO LIVING WAGE JOBS IT PROVIDES A ROUTE OUT OF POVERTY FOR CALIFORNIA FAMILIES AND IT'S A CRUCIAL PART. OF THE STATE'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR ACOSTA. A NEW. NO WE HAVE ALSO. HERNAN ON THE CALL I DON'T KNOW IF THEY WOULD GET ALME IS THERE AS WELL.

GRETA KIDDING POVERTY AND ALL THE GOOD WORK THAT THAT THEY DO AND I'M GLAD TO WORKING WITH THEM. MY QUESTION THOUGH IS THIS CALLS FOR A BELIEVE OF FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS- AS- DO I HAVE THAT RIGHT OR WRONG. ON WHAT THE- IT HAS A FINANCIAL ASPECT TO IT IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN. AND IF IT DOESN'T THEN THE QUESTION IS WHERE IS THIS MONEY GOING TO COME FROM TO DO THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE WE JUST HEARD THE GOVERNOR TODAY TALK ABOUT. ACTUALLY TAKING MONEY OUT OF THE- WORKFORCE THE PROGRAM SO WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. WELL YOU KNOW MY THOUGHT THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION EIGHT AT THERE IS SOME MONEY TIED TO THIS PROGRAM AND- MY UNDERSTANDING AT IN. IN THE MAY REVISED THERE IS SOME MONEY FOR WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAMS- DEAD DEAD DEAD APPEAR A NOW WE HAVEN'T FULLY ANALYZED FEET BE THE MAY REVISED- JUST YET BUT I'D IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THERE IS SOME MONEY. IN THERE FOR WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAMS. I MAY BE WRONG PLEASE DON'T QUOTE ME ON THAT YES IT DOES SAY THE BILL IT SAYS THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE BOARD UPON APPROPRIATION BY THE LEGISLATURE FOR THAT PURPOSE. TO MAKE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. IN GRANTS AVAILABLE TO CONSORTIUM BAUBLE BAR SO- AGAIN I'M JUST WONDERING HOW YOU'RE FACTORING IN OUR CURRENT FISCAL MASS TO. TO WHAT IS A GREAT IDEA. YOU'RE HOPING TO BE ABLE TO KIND OF CALL SOME FUNDS FROM THE- WHY YOU KNOW I THINK THAT- WE WILL MAKE A PUSH IN THE BUDGET TO TRY TO PUT SOME FUNDS TOWARDS US I THINK IT'S AN INVESTMENT THAT IS DESPERATELY NEEDED ESPECIALLY WITH. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE BEAN AT AT THE NUMBER THAT IT IS THE PERCENTAGE THAT IT IS AND ALSO KNOWING THAT IT'S GOING TO COULD POTENTIALLY GOING TO GROW- AND WE I THINK THAT IF WE REALLY ARE WORKING AT GETTING PEOPLE BACK INTO WORK- WE NEED TO MAKE AN INVESTMENT TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. BUY PROPECIA THE EFFORT. TO MOVE THE BILL. THANK IS INTERJECTION AND THE MANY OF THE QUESTIONS COME INSURANCE SEEN NONE- SENATOR HER DAUGHTER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. AS I JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I MEAN THIS IS A WONDERFUL BILL AND IT'S JUST A- I APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING IT. FORWARD TODAY IN AND TO US BECAUSE IT'S A IT'S A- IT'S A NEED THAT'S GOING TO GROW AS WE TRY TO RECOVER FROM CO IN NINETEEN THERE'S O QUESTION ABOUT IT I. AGREE WITH SENATOR JACKSON'S THE CHALLENGE WILL BE. THE FUNDING AND HOPEFULLY YOU'LL BE ABLE TO WORK WITH A WONDERFUL BUDGET CHAIR AND- THE GOVERNOR TO COME TO A SOLUTION TO THAT- AS WE MOVE FORWARD SO. WE HAVE A MOTION FROM SENATOR JACKSON THE MOTIONS TO PASS AS AMENDED. AND THANK YOU FOR ACCEPTING THOSE AMENDMENTS TO APPROPRIATIONS FOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

THESE SO THAT PRESENT TO YOUR BILL SB ELEVEN FIFTY NINE THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE SAKE OF BREVITY I WILL NOT BEGIN WITH A LONG DISCUSSION OF COVERT NINETEEN WE HAVE ALL LIVED IT AND ARE CONTINUING TO LIVE IT. A REAL WILL REITERATE A POINT FROM THE ANALYSIS IN THE PAST IN THE PAST THREE MONTHS MORE AMERICANS HAVE DIED OF COVERT NINETEEN THE DIED DURING THE VIETNAM WAR AT WAR THAT LASTED TWENTY YEARS WELL MUCH MEDIA ATTENTION HAS BEEN ON THE ECONOMIC CHALLENGES OF THIS PANDEMIC THE SCALE OF HUMAN SUFFERING IS UNPRECEDENTED. IT REALLY DIFFICULT TO OVERSTATE. THIS IS WHY I TEAMED UP WITH THE- ASSEMBLY- MY ASSEMBLY COUNTERPART ASSEMBLY MEMBER TOM DALY. TO AUTHOR A WORKERS COMPENSATION PRESUMPTION ON COVERT NINETEEN THIS BILL WILL EXTEND. THE CLOVER NINETEEN REBUTTABLE CONSERVE PRESUMPTION TO BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR WORKERS. WITHOUT QUESTION THIS PRESUMPTION WILL BE THE LARGEST AND MOST EXPANSIVE PRESUMPTION IN THE HISTORY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YES WE NEED TO BE SENSITIVE TO THE COST BORNE BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND SMALL BUSINESSES. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO PROVIDE NECESSARY MEDICAL CARE TO OUR FRONTLINE WORKERS WHO NEED IT MOST.

YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THIS IS MITCH SNIDER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION OUR OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE BILL IS WITH CONCERNS BUT- FORGETTING THEN THE CONCERNS JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR THE INTENT OF THE BILL I THINK WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE AS THE AUTHORS THAT SOME SORT OF REBUTTAL PRESUMPTION MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. BUT WE DO HAVE SOME PECIFIC CONCERNS WITH LANGUAGE IN THE BILL ITSELF PARTICULARLY AROUND THE QUESTION OF A REBUTTABLE WORKING THE CONCLUSIVE PRESUMPTION. I DO BELIEVE THAT A CONCLUSIVE PRESUMPTION WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE TO HELP REDUCE COSTS IN A WORKERS COMP SYSTEM AND HELP SPEED UP MEDICAL TREATMENT AND ACCESS TO AND THEN THEY BENEFITS FOR WORKERS WE- SHE WORKERS REALLY STRUGGLING A WORKERS COMP SYSTEM TO GET COVERED FOR- OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE CLAIMS THAT WE THINK GOING TO A CONCLUSIVE PRESUMPTION WOULD HELP DEAL WITH A LOT OF THOSE DELAYS AND COST. AND ALSO JUST WANTED TO RAISE THE ISSUE OF THE DEFINITION OF CRITICAL WORKER AS IN THE BILL RIGHT NOW SPECIFICALLY THE PHRASING IT ONLY APPLIES TO WORKERS EMPLOYED TO COMBAT THE SPREAD OF. NINETEEN I THINK THAT COULD CREATE A LOT OF QUESTIONS AROUND WHO THIS ACTUALLY APPLIES TO AND WE'VE HAD GREAT CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE ON WAYS TO IMPROVE THAT LOOK FOR THE KEEPING OF CONVERSATIONS GOING- SO WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH SPECIFIC LANGUAGE IN THE BILL BUT VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE INTENT. TOTALLY AGREE THAT SOME SORT OF A PRESUMPTION BACKSTOPS. OKAY THANK YOU ALL TAKE THAT'S A TWEENER COMMENT ARE THERE OTHER PEOPLE OF SPEAKING IN SUPPORT. OF SB ELEVEN FIFTY NINE.

NOW ARE YOU A TWEENER TO. OKAY ONCE YOU GET WHILE WE TAKE THE CLEANERS NOW THEN OKAY THANK YOU I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BURST MY NAME'S JASON SMELTER SHOW YOUR ENTRY SCHMELZER LAYING IN HERE TODAY- ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION ON WORKERS COMPENSATION AND SEE SEC ACCESS INSURANCE AUTHORITY- NOTING THAT THE BILL IS A WORK IN PROGRESS I'M NOT GONNA SPEAK TO THE ACTUAL CONTENTS OF THE BILL RATHER I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT A COUPLE OF BROAD PRINCIPLES. OTHER WERE CONTAINED IN THE LETTER THAT WE SENT TO THE COMMITTEE AND WE SENT A SIMILAR LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR AT FIRST I WOULD JUST OBSERVE BROADLY- THAT THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM IS A SYSTEM JUST LIKE ANY OTHER- WHETHER WE'RE DEALING WITH MEDI CAL OR TAX- TAX INCENTIVES THERE'S ALWAYS A LINE RIGHT THERE'S ALWAYS A LINE- BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO SERVICE VERY SPECIFIC PURPOSE AND IN THIS. INSTANCE THE SPECIFIC PURPOSE IS WORKPLACE INJURIES AND ILLNESSES OKAY SOON WERE HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT A PRESUMPTION OR WERE HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT CHANGING KIND OF THE EVIDENTIARY STANDARD FOR HOW YOU ACCESS THAT SYSTEM WHAT YOU'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT IS WHAT FILTER YOU ARE YOU USING TO EITHER ALLOW PEOPLE IN OR KEEP THEM OUT AND IT'S JUST THAT IT'S THAT SIMPLE SO AGAIN WE WOULD WE WOULD BE VERY HARD ON. THIS THE FILTERS SHOULD KEEP OUT THE NON WORK RELATED INJURIES SO ON A COUPLE OF SPECIFIC ISSUES CONCLUSIVE VERSES REBUTTABLE PASSED OF PRESUMPTIONS A CONCLUSIVE PRESUMPTION WOULD SAY ESSENTIALLY ON EVEN IF I HAD INFORMATION THAT DEMONSTRATED WITH ABSOLUTE CLARITY THAT YOU'RE COVERED NINETEEN FACTION WAS NOT CONTRACTED IN THE WORKPLACE BUT RATHER IT WAS CONTRACTED SOMEWHERE ELSE THERE IS EVIDENCE TO PROVE THAT. I COULD NOT BRING THAT FORWARD AS AN EMPLOYER TO REBUT YOUR PRESUMPTION AND MOVE THAT INFECTION OUT OF THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM MAYBE INTO THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM- THAT I PROVIDE OR OR SOME OTHER SYSTEM WE THINK THAT IS A FUNDAMENTAL VIOLATION OF A HUNDRED YEARS OF WORKERS COMPENSATION LAW- IT NOT ONLY IN THE STATE BUT IN THIS COUNTRY- IT WOULD BE A GROSS VIOLATION OF WHAT THE SYSTEM IS INTENDED TO DO- SO WE OBVIOUSLY WOULD NOT. SUPPORT THAT. WHAT MAKES A CLAY IS IN AND- QUESTION SO DOESN'T EXPOSURE OR A PERCEIVED EXPOSURE- TO MAKE A CLAIM- WE WOULD SUBMIT THAT IT DOES NOT- DO YOU SHOULD HAVE TO HAVE A POSITIVE TEST OR A PHYSICIAN'S DIAGNOSIS- SIMILAR TO SOMETHING THAT WAS IN THE AT THE EXECUTIVE ORDER- BUT SOME LINE THERE. A MERE EXPOSURE CAN BE DEALT WITH THROUGH THE PAID SICK LEAVE BENEFITS THAT WERE PROVIDED ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL IN THE STATE LEVEL- AND SOME OTHER THINGS SO WITH THAT SHOULDN'T CONSTITUTE A CLAIM- THERE'S BEEN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT- EXTENDING STATUTORY BENEFITS THERE ARE OTHER MEASURES THAT ARE OUT THERE. THAT DON'T STICK WITH THE MEDICAL CARE INDEMNITY BENEFITS AND OTHER THINGS THAT ARE PROVIDED BY THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM BUT THEY TRY TO EXPAND IT TO HOUSING AND LIVING EXPENSES AND EVERY. OTHER THINGS I WE OBVIOUSLY WOULD NOT TO SUPPORT AT SUPPORT THAT. ON THE SCOPE OF WORKERS- EIGHT. OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A QUESTION MOVING FORWARD BEYOND THE EXECUTIVE ORDER ABOUT WHO SHOULD BE COVERED BY A PRESUMPTION AGAIN I WILL GO BACK- TO THE TO THE ISSUE AT HAND. THERE NEEDS TO BE A FILTER THEIR OF THE SYSTEM IS TO WORK PROPERLY. SO WHATEVER IT IS IF WE'RE CREATING A PRESUMPTION THE- THE WORKER SHOULD HAVE A HIGHER EXPOSURE IN THE WORKPLACE NAY DO OUTSIDE I WOULD MAKE ONE NOTE AT YOUR TIMES AND THEN I WILL AND I WILL GO. IF YOU NEEDED THAT WRAP UP OKAY. IT'S MY TIME TO WRAP UP. THANK YOU GET. OKAY THANK YOU YOU GET A YEAR THREE MINUTES THERE. OKAY SO THAT SERVICE WE ARE TOO.

THERE ARE NO COMMENTS IN Q. THANK YOU TO ALL OF SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION WITNESSES WE WANNA BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO THE MEMBERS. DO ANY MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS SENATOR JACKSON'S. UP WHILE IBM. HAD IT SHARE SOME CONCERN ABOUT USING PUBLIC DOLLARS. I DO KNOW THAT THIS BILL DOES PROVIDE FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO CURE. AND I THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT IN THIS SITUATION IF INDEED IT'S INADVERTENT IT'LL BE RESOLVED IF IT IS AN INADVERTENT SOMEONE'S GOING TO HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO THE TAXPAYERS WHY THAT MONEY IS BEING SPENT- TO COMPLY WERE IS A SANCTION A PENALTY FOR NOT COMPLYING WITH THE LAW SO. I THINK IT'S A VERY REASONABLE. APPROACH TO A PROBLEM THAT- RIGHT NOW THEY'RE NO TEETH AND THE YOU KNOW I THINK WE'VE ALL EXPERIENCED A SORT OF A- A BEING SHINED ON A BY AGENCIES CENTER FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS BUT IT'S JUST NOT APPROPRIATE AND IT'S KIND OF CONTRARY TO THE LAW. SO I THINK- THIS MAKES SENSE I THINK IT'S A GOOD BALANCE AND I'M HAPPY TO- MOVES ABILITY PREPARATORY. THANK YOU. THE COMMENTS OR DISCUSSIONS SENATOR OTHER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. OUR THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. Q. I'VE HAVE A NUMBER OF COMMENTS I WANTED TO MAKE IT TO GIVE THIS A LOT OF THOUGHT BECAUSE WE'VE HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS AND I APPRECIATE THAT SENATOR ALSO AND I HAVE. IS CONCERNED WITH THE BILL- YOU KNOW WE HAD SOME AMENDMENTS THAT WE THOUGHT WOULD ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS. BUT OTHER AMENDMENTS WERE TALKED ABOUT AND- OFFERED- FLASH NIGHTER YESTERDAY. THE INDEED IN THOSE DID NOT RESOLVE THE ISSUES UNFORTUNATELY SO I WILL HAVE TO BE VOTING NO ON THE BILL TODAY I CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL THAT CREATES A RIGHT TO ATTORNEYS FEES FOR UNIONS TO BRING PER ACTIONS AGAINST CALIFORNIA CITIES COUNTIES AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS INCREASE MONETARY PENALTIES FOR THOSE PUBLIC AGENCIES BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAND OVER EMPLOYEE CONTACT AT A TO THE UNION QUICKLY ENOUGH. REPUBLICAN LAWYERS AND PARTNERS ARE BUCKLING UNDER THE SOCIAL HEALTH AND ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF THE CODE NINETEEN CRISIS THE REVENUES ATTACKED. THE COST OF INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY AND SO HAS THE WORKLOAD. MEANWHILE WHETHER EMPLOYEES ARE STRUGGLING TO ADAPT TO WORKING FROM HOME OR WITH UNFAMILIAR TECHNOLOGY SEPARATED FROM THEIR COLLEAGUES THEIR OFFICES IN THEIR NORMAL RESOURCES ALL WATCH WHILE TRYING TO CONFRONT THE CHALLENGES OF THIS PANDEMIC I FIND IT PUZZLING. THAT WE WOULD TAKE THIS MOMENT. TO MAKE THEM MORE VULNERABLE TO FURTHER REVENUE LOSSES AND FRANKLY LITIGIOUS TIMES SUCKS TICKET OUR UNION FRIENDS INFORMATION. THAT THEY COULD GET THROUGH THEIR OWN EFFORTS AND MOSTLY DO GET FROM MOST PUBLIC EMPLOYERS. I DON'T ASSURE GOOD THIS THIS THIS BILL IS CREATING A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTOR PAGO FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT DISPUTES. AND THAT IS GOING TO LEAD TO GREATER PURPOSE CHARGE WHEN WE KNOW THAT PURPLE ALREADY LIKELY SEE INCREASED WORKLOAD FROM THE SERVICES OF THE SEVERE DISRUPTIONS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE ACROSS OUR PUBLIC SECTOR. PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE IT REQUIRES PERPETUAL ATTORNEYS FEES TO UNIONS WHO WIN BUT NOT THE PUBLIC AGENCIES OR WHEN. SUBJECT PUBLIC AGENCIES TO UNSPECIFIED MONETARY PENALTIES PROVIDE REALLY SHORT TIMELINE FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYERS TO RESPOND BEFORE GETTING DRAGGED PER. GIVES THESE PER CHARGES AN EXPEDITED PROCESS WHICH TEND IS GOING AGAINST OTHER POTENTIAL UNIONS THAT MAYBE APPLYING FOR PER. CONDITIONS OR A TIME. GIVES THE ILLUSION OF A CURE PERIOD BUT GIVES THE UNION AN UNSUPERVISED VETO OVER THAT CURE. THE MEMBERS- PROS PROPOSED MILDLY BUT GOING SUBSTANTIALLY MAKE A CHANGE FOR THAT SAID IT TO THAT BECAUSE OF PURGATORY FEES WILL BE AWARDED. NOW TO THE PREVAILING PARTY UNION OR EMPLOYER BUT ONLY ON APPEAL- SO I'VE BEEN AND THEN THERE'S ADDED SOMETHING CALLED ENFORCEMENT EXPENSE TO THE AMOUNT THAT THE PUBLIC AGENCY HAS TO PAY. IF IT LOSES ON APPEAL. I'M NOT EVEN SURE WHAT THAT ENTAILS NOR WHAT CAN'T QUALIFY UNDER THAT RUBRIC THIS BILL REALLY CREATES A FORMER PUB TYPICAL PUBLIC AGENCIES. NO LONGER HAVE MEANINGFUL APPEAL RIGHTS FOR THESE REASONS I CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL AND I THINK IT NEEDS SOME SOME WORK. IF IT WERE TO COME BACK AND IN SOME FORM OR ANOTHER SO I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT- SENATOR DRAWS BUT- WE DO HAVE A- BELIEVEA MOTION FROM THE SENATOR JACKSON. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SENATORS PLEASE TURN ON YOUR MICROPHONES IN ORDER TO VOTE. THE MOTION IS DO THEY HAVE TO. IT SHOULD DIE I KNOW WHETHER WE SHOULD AFFORD THE SENATOR ENOUGH AND SHE CLOSED AN OPPORTUNE RESPOND TO THIS WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND SENATOR ROGER I'M SORRY I'VE THAT WAS. MORE BY A STATEMENT OF MY POSITION SURE A AND. OF COURSE YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY LIKE USER DRUGS I APOLOGIZE IF I DIDN'T DO THAT I SHOULD OF OTHERS THE STEADY MORE MY POSITION OF THE BILL THAT EVERYONE HAS BEEN SEEN IN THE ANALYSIS OF IT OUTLINES WHAT I JUST SAID. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR HILL ON THE CENTER PAN I LOOK WE THERE ARE CERTAIN ISSUES- IN TERMS OF THE AMENDMENT THAT WE PROPOSE THAT WE WOULD CONTINUE TO WORK. WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS ON. WHETHER IT'S YOU KNOW CAPPING PENALTIES OR WHETHER IT'S THAT THE PENALTIES CAN GO INTO THE PROBE GENERAL FUND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF WAYS THAT WE COULD- WE COULD CLARIFY THOSE THOSE ISSUES- BUT WE JUST- IF IT'S GOING TO WEAKEN EXISTING LAW THEN WE'RE GOING BACKWARDS AND WE DON'T WANT TO GO BACKWARDS YOU KNOW.

THERE ARE MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOMESTIC WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA AND MORE THAN TWO MILLION HOUSEHOLDS DEPEND ON THEM. TO CARE FOR THEIR HOMES SENIORS AND CALIFORNIANS WITH DISABILITIES. THESE DOMESTIC WORKERS ARE PRIMARILY- WOMEN OF COLOR THEY ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE ECONOMY AND THE ABILITY OF CALIFORNIANS TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY THEY DESERVE CONSIDERATION FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES JUST LIKE ANY OTHER WORKING MAN OR WOMAN- WE CANNOT WE SHOULD NOT EXCLUDE GROUPS OF WORKERS FROM HEALTH AND SAFETY. NOT DURING THIS PANDEMIC NOT DURING WHILE FAR IS NOT DURING NOT IN EVERY DAY THAT PUTS THEIR HEALTH THE WELL BEING AND THEIR FAMILIES ON THE LINE- DOMESTIC WORKERS HEALTH AND SAFETY HAVE BEEN PUT AT SEVERE RISK. DURING THE RECENT DISTRAUGHT DISASTERS THAT OBSTRUCT CALIFORNIA- THERE ON THE FRONT LINES DURING THE PANDEMIC- THEY REMAIN VULNERABLE AND WITHOUT PROTECTIONS DURING THE WILDFIRES DOMESTIC WORKERS AND OTHER HOUSEHOLD WORKERS WERE ASKED TO STAY BEHIND TO FIGHT BUYERS TO GUARD HOMES OUR PETS AND- WORK IN SMOKY CONDITIONS AND CLEAN UP TOXIC ASH- THEY WERE. FURTHER PUT AT RISK WHEN EMPLOYERS FAILED TO TELL THEM THAT THE HOMES THEY WORK IN WONDER MANDATORY IN BACK EVACUATION. AT THE GROWING FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY OF WILDFIRES AND OTHER NATURAL DESIRES DISASTERS REQUIRES THAT LEGISLATORS TAKE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION TO PROTECT THEM WELL HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THESE PRIMARILY WOMEN WORKERS.

MEMBERS OF QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SENATOR FOR ACTION AND THEN VICE CHAIR MORAL YOU KNOW I THOUGHT I'D LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF HOW IT IS THAT WE HAVE EXEMPTED EXCEPT- DOMESTIC WORKERS FOR MANY OF THE PROTECTIONS AND IT REALLY. WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO THE SOUTH. OF THE NOTION THAT THEY WOULD NOT AGREE TO I DON'T KNOW IF WAS THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OR WHATEVER BUT- THE IS THIS REALLY WAS IN. TOTALLY RACIALLY MOTIVATED AT THE TIME AND IT'S BEEN PERPETUATED OVER THE COURSE OF YEARS. SO IAGREE THAT WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT I DO THINK THOUGH THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN GOING TO THIS AS WELL SO. I'M GONNA SUPPORTED OF BIG- ON PRINCIPLES MATTER POLICY BUT I DO THINK THERE ARE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE- INCLUDED IN THIS WHOLE PROCESS GOING FORWARD SO. I WANT TO BE CLEAR ON THAT- BUT- I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS READING ABOUT THIS NOT TOO LONG AGO THIS IS JUST THE WAS SUCH A BLATANTLY RACIST COMPROMISE- BECAUSE MOST OF THE- DOMESTIC WORKERS WERE BLACK. WOMEN PRIMARILY IN THE SOUTH WHO WERE COOKS AND TAKEN CARE OF WHY PEOPLE'S CHILDREN AND- THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE THEM THE STATURE. GOD THAT THE OTHER EMPLOYEES WERE GIVEN SO AS A AS AS A WAY TO TRY TO ADDRESS AN INEQUITY THAT HAS GONE ON FOR FAR TOO LONG RIGHT I AM GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU SO. BASED MERLE. THANK YOU. CENTER ALSO I WOULD JUST HAVE A QUICK QUESTION BECAUSE I I'M- TRYING TO. GET A BETTER HANDLE ON US WOULD WITH THIS PARTICULAR BILL. AFFECT PART TIME BABYSITTERS LIKE MAYBE A HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR OUT WOULD FALL UNDER THAT CATEGORY. NO I MEAN YOU HAVE TO BE A- AN EMPLOYEE BUT IF I COULD HAVE THE- WE CAN HAVE THE- OUR EXPERT. WITNESS. ERA OF FOR SURE ANSWER ON THAT SHOULD LARA'S AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND NO. NO UP BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE S THERE ANYONE IN PARTICULAR YOU WOULD LIKE TO CALL SENATOR DORADO VISIT MISS ORTEZ. YEAH SHE'S. YEAH THEY WOULD NOT. IT DOES NOT INCLUDE- LIKE PART TIME BABYSITTERS TEENAGE BABYSITTERS HI. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YES SENATOR PAT. THANK YOU CENTER DORADO- FOR HIS BILL FORD- I UNDERSTAND THAT. SO I GUESS THE QUESTION I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HERE IS THAT- CERTAINLY. TERMS ARE JUST EXEMPTING HOUSEHOLD DOMESTIC- SERVICE. DOES THIS PROBLEMATIC AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S SOME USE EXAMPLES THAT YOU GET FOR EXAMPLE LIKE IN A DISASTER THAT THEY CAN'T EVACUATE SO THAT SOUNDS PRETTY STRAIGHT FOR BUT I GUESS THE OTHER I DO WANNA TRY UNDERSTAND SORT OF WHAT THE SCOPE OF THE BILL WOULD BE- SINCE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WORKING INSIDE HOMES SO- DOES CAL OSHA CURRENTLY HAVE STANDARDS FOR RESIDENTS THE FOR RESIDENTIAL HOMES AND WOULD INVOLVE FOR EXAMPLE REQUIRING. A HOMEOWNER TO HAVE TO I GUESS A YELL REDESIGN THE STAIRS OR SOME ANY I GUESS THE QUESTION YEAH SO DO YOU THE INTELLIGENCE USED TO DEALING WITH WORKPLACES SIDE SO YES SENSE OF WHAT WE'RE AT WILL BOB WHAT IS- WHERE THE BOUNDARIES ARE FOR CAL OSHA DO THEY HAVE STANDARDS FOR RESIDENTIAL HOMES ARE YOU EXPECTING THEM TO DEVELOP THEM AND- SO WHAT ARE AND WHAT WOULD BE THE SCOPE OF THOSE TYPES OF REGULATIONS SO I AM HERE VIEWS TALK ABOUT AIR QUALITY AND- YEAH YOU TALKED ABOUT. CO THE MAKER OF IT'S ALWAYS THE NOW BUT THERE ARE YOU KNOW SOMETIMES YOU CAN HAVE OTHER PEOPLE IT WAS A OF KIDS AND- VOTERS WAIT THEY DON'T GET VACCINATED IN MY GET CHICKENPOX OKAY HOPE THEY ARE VACCINATED. AND ACTUALLY MAYBE IF THE REQUIRED KIDS GET VACCINATED THAT MIGHT BE GOOD THANKS- THE OF A DOMESTIC WORKER BUT- BUT I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE SO WHAT KIND OF. THAT WHAT IS THE CURRENT STATUS IN TERMS OF SO YOU'RE SAYING OKAY CAL OSHA STANDARDS AT THE PLIGHT. THEN IF THIS BILL SHOULD PASS AND THE LAW. WHAT THEN HAPPENS IN TERMS OF. IN TERMS OF SETTING EXPECTATIONS FOR THE- THAT THE FOR THE EMPLOYERS TO THEY ARE WORK AND FOR THESE EMPLOYEES ARE WORKING INSIDE SOMEONE'S HOME. AND IT IS A WORKPLACE THAT WE WANT TO SHOW THEIR SAFE BUT WHAT WHAT EXACTLY WOULD BE THE EXTENT. OF THE REQUIREMENTS ON. THE EMPLOYER NOT ONLY YOUR TERMS OF HAVING TO CHANGE STRUCTURES OR OTHER TYPES OF THINGS. WELL AS I UNDERSTAND IT CAL OSHA IS A COMPLAINT DRIVEN AGENCIES SO- THEY WILL. NOT JUST GO OUT. TO HOMES AND CHECK YOU OUT AND SEE WHAT ARE YOUR YOU KNOW HEALTH AND SAFETY YOU KNOW CONDITIONS- WHAT CAL OSHA WILL DO IS ISSUE THE GUIDANCE. FOR THAT INDUSTRY. SO THEY'LL COME UP WITH AND THEY'LL WORK WITH DOMESTIC WORK. WITH YOUR WORK EMPLOYERS. UP AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW THEY WORK TOGETHER TO IDENTIFY YOU KNOW WHAT OTHER COMMON HAZARDS- HOW TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO CORRECT THE HAZARD. THEY'LL WORK WITH- WORKERS ALSO ON THE WORKERS SIDE- WITH TRAINING AND TOOLS TO PREVENT INJURIES AND ILLNESSES IN THE WORKPLACE. SO THEIR WHOLE PURPOSE OF HAVING CAL OSHA IS TO HELP BOTH THE EMPLOYERS. AND THE WORKERS BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY ARE THERE PARTICULAR WAYS THAT YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF CLEANING YOU KNOW. LIQUIDS AND WHICH ONES ARE SAFE AND WHICH ONES ARE AND HOW DO YOU USE THEM- SO THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF HAVING AN AGENCY. BE ABLE TO GUIDE. THE EMPLOYERS AS WELL AS AS THE THEM DOMESTIC WORKERS SO THEY KOW WHAT'S SAFE AND WHAT WHAT IS IT. AND IF THERE IS A PARTICULAR COMPLAINT WHICH IS OF. A VERY SPECIFIC TO THAT LOCATION THEN THEY'LL GO OUT AND AGAIN THEY'LL TRY TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT HAPPENED WHAT'S THE ISSUE HOW DO YOU CORRECTED HOW DO YOU. BECAUSE THE WHOLE POINT IS TO HAVE BETTER WORKING CONDITIONS AS NOT TO. YOU KNOW JUST GO AFTER AN EMPLOYER SO THAT'S HOW I UNDERSTAND THAT I DON'T KNOW MR DEES IF YOU CAN ADD ANYTHING TO THAT. SENATOR GLASS SO YOU YOU GOT IT ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND I THINK JUST TO GIVE A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE FOR WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE WERE AND MERGING KEY STANDARDS THAT CALLOSUM PASSED. FOR EXAMPLE WITH ALL THE RECENT WILDFIRES. THE BEST WORKERS ARE NOT COVERED. UNDER ANY OF THOSE STANDARDS- IN TERMS OF BEING EXPOSED TO SMOKE FOR EXAMPLE- OR EVEN HAPPY SO- WHEN THEY'RE THEY ARE WORKING THEN EVACUATION DOLLARS. THIS REALLY IS ABOUT HOW DO WE ISSUE GUIDANCE. TO EMPLOYERS TO WHAT THEY HAVE THOSE SO CALLED TO UNDERSTAND OUR OBLIGATIONS THIS IS NOT ABOUT SENDING PEOPLE TO KNOCK ON PEOPLE'S DOORS. OKAY NINE I GET THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE AREN'T GOING. TO BASICALLY EN MASSE GOING BUT WHEN SOMEONE FILES A COMPLAINT. THEN SOMEONE IS. COMING INTO SOMEONE'S HOME AND SAYING. WE NEED SO RIGHT SO YOU NEED TO THE HEALTH ACCESS OR SOMETHING. FIRST THERE WILL BE A PHONE CALL AND OR EMAIL- AND THEN IT WILL MOVE FROM THERE AND IT IS THAT WE'RE GRANT THAT'S YET TO BE DESIGN SO JUST LIKE WITH AGRICULTURE. THERE'S GONNA BE A YOU KNOW OUT REACH PROGRAM THAT'S GOOD THAT YOU KNOW EDUCATE AND INFORM BOTH THE EMPLOYER- AND THE WORKERS ABOUT THEIR RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS. SO I DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD EXPECT THAT. WELL I AM AT NAY A. B. HELPFUL THAT ARE MORE BOUNDARIES ARE DEFINITIONS. HERE BECAUSE. RIGHT NOW JUST AS WITH THE LEAD AT. AND WE ARE TO AMIN THIS IS THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN- SOMEONE'S RESIDENTS BECAUSE THE AND SO IT'S NOT. I GUESS. TERMS OF THE NATURE OF THE WORKPLACE ITSELF I GUESS WE CAN SAY THAT IF YOU HIRE ANYONE TO WORK IN YOUR HOUSE I THINK IT GOES TO THE NOTED THAT THE NOW YOU BECOME A WORKPLACE SO. MAYBE IT IS I GOT TO GET BUT IT BUT I'M NOT SURE IT WAS GOING TO VIEW IT THAT WAY AND WHAT I'M YOU KNOW THE CONCERN WOULD BE. ALSO IS THAT- IF. SOMEONE'S HOME- IS VIEWED AS BASICALLY A PUBLIC SPACE BECAUSE YOU KNOW BUSINESSES ARE AT LEAST DOWN ON TIGHTLY PUBLIC BUT SOME SOMEWHAT MORE PUBLIC THAN OF SOMEONE'S RESIDENTS- THEN WOULD THAT ALSO BECAUSE- YOU KNOW THAT PEOPLE TO DRIVE THIS UNDERGROUND RIGHT AND- AND WE CAN MAKE IT MORE PROBLEMATIC AS WELL. SO BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT INVASION OF PRIVACY RIGHTS SO SOMEONE DID THEIRWORK AND COMPLAINS CAL OSHA MASON AN EMAIL OR PHONE CALL BUT NAY EVENTUALLY SHOW UP AND SAY HEY I WANT SPEC THE HOUSE. RIGHT AND- AND TRIGGER A BUNCH OF THINGS RELATED TO THAT SO IT SO I THINK OF. BE HELPFUL. TO FIGURE OUT. SOME BROWN TO OR SOME GUIDANCE THE CALLOW RIGHT YOU SAID TO SOME OF THAT HAVE TO BE DEVELOPED BECAUSE IN IN RELATION TO THE FACT THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE'S HOMES THAT THEY HAVE CHOSEN TO HIRE SOMEONE- TO WORK THERE SO THAT YOU KNOW IN SOME SENSES STATE THE TO MAKE THAT DECISION BUT WHAT EXACTLY WOULD BE THE PARAMETERS UNDER WHICH CAL OSHA WOULD BE ABLE TO OPERATE IN TERMS OF- BOTH ASSURING THAT WORKER SAFETY WHILE ALSO ENSURING THE PRIVACY OF THE HOMEOWNER AND IT WILL BE OURS SO STRIKING THE BALANCE THERE. WELL AT. WELL FIRST OF ALL THERE'S ALREADY A RELATIONSHIP THERE BECAUSE YOU'RE AN EMPLOYER IN YOUR SUBJECT TO MINIMUM WAGE AND OVERTIME SO THERE'S ALREADY BEEN OVER MANY YEARS THAT YOU KNOW SLOWLY ADDING MORE AND MORE TO THAT WHAT THAT RELATIONSHIP IS GOING TO BE IT SHOULD BE EVEN THOUGH IT'S YOUR HOME IT SHOULD BE UP THE LOSSES IS THERE EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP SO THAT'S ALREADY THERE REGARDLESS OF ADDING BOMB- CAL OSHA- BUT AGAIN I THINK THE WHOLE IDEA IS WE HAVE TO GIVE CAL OSHA THE OPPORTUNITY. TO YOU KNOW THEY'RE THE EXPERTS THEY KNOW WHAT'S- WHAT'S SAFE THEY KNOW WHAT'S HARMFUL THEY KNOW WHAT ISN'T- AND WE HAVE TO GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY DEVELOP THOSE GUIDANCE SO I THINK THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE WHERE IS THE SCOPE OF WHAT WILL THEY COVER HOW WILL THEY DO IT WILL COME IN THAT PROCESS TO ALLOW CASH CAL OSHA TO THE- DEVELOP THAT PROCESS AND COME UP WITH MORE PARTICULARS I DON'T KNOW HOW WE COULD. DEVELOP THOSE PARTICULARS AT THIS POINT OTHER THAN TO AS CAL OSHA'S THEIR AGENCY GIVE IT TO THEM TO FIGURE OUT THE DETAILS OF IT YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S THEIR WHOLE POINT WELL IN THE ABSENT FISHINGGOLDENSON OUT BASICALLY I THINK I THINK MY CONCERN IS THAT. IT'S NOT A TYPICAL WORKPLACE AND- YES THE COLLEGE YOU WILL FIGURE OUT THE DETAILS BUT WE MIGHT WANT TO PUT SOME GUIDANCE INTO THIS BECAUSE OF THE FACT RECOGNIZING THAT THIS WORK PLACES ALSO SOMEONE'S RESIDENTS AND THERE ARE SOME THERE MAY BE SOME PRIVACY OTHER TYPES OF ISSUES INVOLVED IN TERMS OF HAVING INSPECTORS SOMEONE GOING INTO THE HOME THAT MAY NOT QUITE BE THE SAME AS SOMEONE GOING TO WORKPLACE HIM WHAT WHAT YOU GET PAID IN YOUR HOURS AND SO FORTH- THAT THAT'S THAT DOESN'T NECESSARY GET INTO THE DETAILS OF SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE BUT SOMEONE WALKING AROUND THE HOUSE AND- THE EVENTUALLY TO SAY WELL OOK THE STRUCTURALLY WHATEVER ELSE BUT THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING OUT OF THINGS TO. MADE MAYBE BLOW. MORE CONCERNING FOR SOME THAT IN TERMS. WHAT'S HAPPENING AROUND HOMES I JUST I THINK WE JUST WE TO RECORD. THAT BECAUSE IT IS SOMEONE'S HOUSE THAT IS THAT THE WORKING AND. SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU AS I JUST LISTEN TO DOCTOR PAN AYE THIS KIND OF BEGAN TO MAKE A NOTE OF AYE OF ACTIONS WE'VE TAKEN WHERE PEOPLE RUN BUSINESSES OUT OF THEIR HOME FAMILY CHILDCARE DSS HAS TO INSPECT FOSTER CARE WE ARE IN HEALTH COMMITTEE A COUPLE YEARS AGO YOU KNOW WHEN TO THIS WHOLE PROCESS OF KIND OF REGULATING ALLOW PEOPLE TO COOK FOOD IN THEIR HOME AND SELL IT AND THERE WAS AN ISSUE AROUND INSPECTING THE LOCATIONS FOR THE SAFETY AND SO I HEAR YOU IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW PRIVACY BUT IF YOU MAKE THE DECISION TO EMPLOY SOMEONE TO COME INTO THE HOME. BUT I THINK YOU HAVE TO STEP UP TO. BE A REASONABLE EMPLOYER. I THINK IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT AND I DON'T KNOW THAT WOULD BE IN OUR IN IN THE COLLECTIVE BEST INTEREST IF WE WERE THAT PRESCRIPTIVE IN LEGISLATION THIS BILL OR ANY OTHER B. L. BUT TO ALLOW CAL OSHA. THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME UP WITH A FRAMEWORK THAT MAKES SENSE I DO THINK THAT THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE MORE APPROPRIATE FOR THAT ENTITY TO DO THAT. VERSUS US TRY TO DO IT IN THE CONTENT OF THE BILL ITSELF. BUT I JUST I JUST AS I LISTEN TO HAVE THAT WILL THERE IN ANY NUMBER OF OTHER EXAMPLES- THAT WE'VE ALREADY SORT OF CROSS THE LINE. IN TERMS OF GOVERNMENT ENTITIES- IT'LL REGULATING- UP IN SOME WAY INSPECTING PRIVATE RESIDENCE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR YOU SENATOR MITCHELL AND- THE FOR THE COMMENT ARE. I OF. EIGHT YOU KNOW I JUST I THINK THE EFFORT THE ENERGY AND CERTAINLY THE COMMITMENT THAT YOU MADE TO THIS ISSUE AND IT DEFINITELY NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES HERE WE WANT TO PROTECT THOSE WORKERS BECAUSE- IT'S SO OFTEN AND I THINK. THAT THE STORIES WE'VE HEARD OVER THE YEARS ARE JUST NOT VERY. NOT VERY GOOD- DAR POSITIVE BUT THEIR EYES HAVE YOU'VE HEARD THERE ARE A LOT OF CHALLENGES WITH A WITH THE BILL THAT- AND AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS WE DON'T KEEP TRACK OF WHO'S AN EMPLOYER IN THE INDUSTRY- AND SO HOW CAN WE EXPECT THE STATE TO DO THAT IT IN. ITS COMPLAINT BASED THAT WE PROTECT HOMEOWNERS WHILE ENSURING DOMESTIC WORKERS RIGHTS AND SAFETY AND THAT- THE ENFORCEMENT IN A PRIVATE HOME- IT SHOULD JUST BE EITHER A LOT OF THINGS IN HERE THAT ARE CHALLENGING AND I WOULD. I WOULD THINK THAT WE CAN GO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS SAY THEY GET AN APPROPRIATION I BELIEVE LAST YEAR'S BUDGET TO. LOOK AT THIS ISSUE AND TRY TO DETERMINE A WAY TO CREATE MORE AWARENESS AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE LABOR PROTECTIONS THAT AFFECT THE DOMESTIC WORKER INDUSTRY- SO I COMMEND YOU FOR THIS I WILL BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY- AND- BUT- IF. IT WILL NEED SOME. BEFORE AND SOME REAL TO FIND. THAT I THINK WE CAN CLEARLY GET OUR ARMS AROUND- BEFORE- I COULD SUPPORT ON THE FLOOR. THAT IS WHAT I ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO THAT SENATOR PAN OKAY AND I JUST WANT TO DO THAT. IN A PRICE SIX SOMETHING SIMILAR I KNOW YOUR HEARTS IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND SO FORTH I. WOULD LIKE TO SEE A LITTLE MORE WORK HAPPEN UNLESS AND WE GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT. THANK YOU. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSER TO DRUGS OF THIS TIME TO VOTE I ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND FOR YOUR SUGGESTIONS ARE APPRECIATED THANK YOU- IS THERE ENTERTAIN A MOTION. A MOTION BY SENATOR JACKSON THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MEMBERS PLEASE TURN ON YOUR MICROPHONES IN ORDER TO VOTE HELLO HI CENTER HILL HI SENATOR MOREAU. SENATOR JACKSON HI SENATOR JACKSON HI SENATOR MITCHELL HI SENATOR MITCHELL HI SENATOR PAN HI SENATOR PAN HI THE BILL HAS FOUR VOTES ITSELF THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IN A MOVE TO SENATOR TRACTION SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE. PLEASE PROCEED AT YOUR CONVENIENCE THANK YOU SIR MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRING FORWARD SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE THIS IS A BILL THAT I HAVE INTRODUCED IN RESPONSE TO THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. ALONG WITH FACING THE HEALTH SAFETY AND ECONOMIC ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PANDEMIC THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE ALSO FACING THE DEVASTATING IMPACT OF SCHOOL CLOSURES ON THEIR ABILITY TO KEEP THEIR JOBS AND BALANCE WORK AND FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO EDUCATE THEIR CHILDREN- POTENTIALLY WITHOUT AN EDUCATION DEGREE OR TEACHING CREDENTIAL- ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS AND ANOTHER 70% OF CHILD CARE CENTERS HAVE CLOSED. AND THIS IS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE AND EVEN IF THEY DO OPEN THERE IS AN EXPECTATION THAT IF THERE IS A SPIKE OR ANOTHER SURGE WHICH IS ALSO VERY MUCH A POSSIBILITY- THOSE STAYED HOME ORDERS WILL BE. PUT BACK IN PLACE SO THESE CURRENT ORDERS ARE PREVENTING PERRANCE FROM BEING ABLE TO CALL ON EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBERS SUCH AS GRANDPARENTS OR BABYSITTERS FOR BACKUP CHILDCARE PARENTS ARE ALSO BEING ASKED TO ACT AS I MENTION IS THEIR CHILDREN'S TEACHERS. BY FACILITATING DISTANCE LEARNING DALY SCHOOL ASSIGNMENTS THAT THEY ARE EXPECTED TO- PRODUCE AND TO ASSIST THEIR CHILDREN IN PRODUCING AND LET'S FACE IT TO CULTURAL EXPECTATIONS ARE THESE BURDENS FALL MOST HEAVILY ON MOTHER'S I'M NOT SAYING DAD'S DON'T HELP- BUT THEY DO HISTORICALLY AND CULTURALLY TEND TO FALL ON MOTHERS. WOMEN HAVE ALSO MADE UP 60% OF THE JOB LOSSES IN THIS CRISIS AND THEIR JOB LOSSES HAVE OUTNUMBERED MAN'S IN NEARLY EVERY SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY SO WOMEN ARE NOW DISPROPORTIONATELY LEFT WITH NO CHOICE TO GIVE THEIR JOBS TO PROVIDE CARE. WITH NO GUARANTEE OF AN OPPORTUNITY TO RETURN AND LEAVING THE JOB MARKET WE KNOW CAN HAVE LASTING IMPACT ON WOMEN'S CAREER TRAJECTORIES WAGERS. AND THOSE FURTHER FURTHERING THE GENDER WAGE GAP SOMETHING THAT WE ARE ALL TRYING TO. REDUCE AND ELIMINATE. SO ALL OF THIS IS PLACING AN EXTRAORDINARY STRAIN ON WORKING FAMILIES AND LAYING BARE THE SIGNIFICANT WEAKNESSES IN OUR LEAVE LOSS. AT A TIME OF UNPRECEDENTED JOB LOSS WE SHOULD NOT LET INADEQUATE LEAVE LAWS FORCE MORE PARENTS INTO A SITUATION WHERE THEY CANNOT KEEP THEIR JOBS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN CARING FOR THEIR CHILDREN. AND GOING TO WORK IT'S IN THIS CONTEXT THAT I BRING FORWARD THIS BILL WHICH STRENGTHENS THE UNPAID. UNPAID JOB PROTECTED PROTECTED TIME AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIANS AS A RESULT OF SCHOOL IN CHILDCARE CLOSURE EMERGENCIES THROUGH A LAW THAT IS KNOWN AS THE CHILD OF THE SCHOOL FAMILY PARTNERSHIP PACKED. THERE WERE A FEW YEARS AGO I AUTHORED A BILL THAT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW TO INCLUDE SCHOOL IN CHILDCARE A MERCHANT SEES AS ELIGIBLE REASONS FOR USING TIME UNDER THE SCHOOL FAMILY PARTNERSHIP ACT. TO GIVE ALL WORKING PARENTS TIME TO ADDRESS UNFORESEEN EMERGENCIES THAT PROHIBIT THE CHILD FROM ATTENDING SCHOOL ARE GOING TO CHILD CARE THIS MEASURE STRENGTHENS THE FAMILY SCHOOL PARTNERSHIP BACK TO DO THREE THINGS. FIRST IT WILL CLARIFY THAT A SCHOOL CLOSURE PURSUANT TO A STATE OF EMERGENCY DECLARATION. FEDERAL STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENTS QUALIFIES AS AN EMERGENCY THIS INCLUDES STATE OF EMERGENCY DECLARED AS A RESULT OF COURSE THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC BUT ALSO EMERGENCIES AS A LOOK ASSOCIATED WITH THINGS LIKE WILD FIRES AND EARTHQUAKES. SECOND IT WILL PROVIDE WORKING PARENTS THE ABILITY TO TAKE UNPAID JOB PROTECTED LEAVE FOR THE DURATION OF THE SCHOOL OR- CARE A MARGIN AND NOT SHOW STILL A MINUTE. HOURS CURRENT A LAW UNDER STATE LAW. FAR BECAUSE THE MORE NEVER SPENT ANY OF US. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW CAL. TO TAKE SHARPER TECH. UNPAID TIME OFF TO CARE FOR THEIR CHILDREN SCHOOL CHILDCARE. BARTLET'S OF THEIR EMPLOYERS. NACHOS THOSE WHO WORK AND- WITH TWENTY FIVE OR MORE EMPLOYEES. AND WITHOUT THE CHANGE MANY PARENTS PUT. THOSE WHO WORK HOURS JOB AND WHO ARE FROM LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME BACKGROUNDS WILL BE LEFT WITH A HOBSON'S CHOICE. THE CHOICE OF CHOOSING BETWEEN THEIR CHILDREN- THEIR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION AND HEALTH AND SAFETY AND THEIR ABILITY TO KEEP THEIR JOB TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS AND OTHERWISE MAKE ENDS MEET. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO ADDRESS CONCERNS. THAT WERE RAISED BY THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AT A AT A LATE MOMENT AND I RECOGNIZE WE ARE IN A VERY- CONSOLIDATED PERIOD- I AM HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE- ENTITIES WHOSE OPPOSITION WE WOULD TRUST WE JUST RECEIVED. THE CHAMBER AND THE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION ABOUT THE SCOPE OF THE BILL. I'M HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THEM I APPRECIATE THEIR INPUT- THIS BILL IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND WE HOPE TO CONTINUE THOSE DISCUSSIONS GOING FORWARD. SO IN CLOSING THE GOVERNOR OFFERED TALKS ABOUT RISING TO MEET THE MOMENT IN THIS SPACE MEETING THE MOM. AND THE CHALLENGES THAT THIS MOMENT CREATES THIS IS A PANDEMIC THIS MOMENT IS UNDERSCORED THE CRITICAL NEED TO STRENGTHEN OUR LEAVE LAWS FOR PLANNING FOR COUNTLESS OTHER EMERGENCIES THAT COULD RESULT- BASED UPON JUST CALIFORNIA'S VERY NATURE BEING EARTHQUAKE WRITTEN- WILDFIRES FLOODS. AND OF COURSE THE POTENTIAL- THAT WE WILL SEE OTHER PANDEMICS BEYOND- THE CRISIS WE'RE DEALING WITH NOW. THAT COULD RESULT IN SCHOOL AND DAY CLERK AT DAYCARES CLOSURES LIKE THIS IN THE FUTURE AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. I KNOW THAT JOINING ME REMOTELY- TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS KATIE WITCHER TO AN ATTORNEY WITH LEGAL AID AT WORK- THE ENTITY. IS SPONSORING THIS IMPORTANT BILL. PLEASE SERVICE WHICH IT PLAY PROCEED. IN YOUR COMMENT YOU HAVE THREE UP TO THREE MINUTES. AND I'M A STAFF ATTORNEY AT LEGAL AID AT WORK A CROWD SPONSOR OF SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE. LEGALLY AT WORK AT THE NONPROFIT THAT FIGHT FOR THE RIGHTS OF LOW WAGE WORKERS ARE WORKING FAMILY PROGRAM MUST BE CALLED FROM OVER A THOUSAND FAMILY PER YEAR WHO ARE DEALING WITH A FAMILY OR MEDICAL CRISIS. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY CAN HEAR FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILY WITHOUT LOSING THEIR JOB AND THEIR INCOME. MARCH MANY OF THE CALLS WE RECEIVED BANNED FROM PARENTS. WHOSE CHILDREN SCHOOL EVERY DAY CARES THE CLOSED. DUE TO THE CUP IN NINETEEN RIGHT THAT. WE HEARD FROM ONE MOTHER WORKING FOR A RESTAURANT CHAIN. FOUR DAUGHTERS WERE WITHOUT CARE BECAUSE THEIR SCHOOL HAD CLOSE. SHE AFTER EMPLOYER FOR TIME OFF TO CARE FOR THEM IN THE TOLD THAT IF SHE TOOK A DAY OFF SHE WOULD BE FIRED. EVERY SINGLE PARENT AND THE PHONE PROVIDER FOR HER FAMILY SHE WAS DEVASTATED. BY IT WHAT CHOICE DID SHE HAVE SHE COULDN'T LEAVE HER CHILDREN ALONE AT HOME. SIMILARLY BUT WE HEARD FROM A FATHER WHO CALLED BECAUSE AFTER A FOR A LOT OF. HIS EMPLOYER WITH ASKING HIM TO COME BACK TO WORK BUT HE HAD NO ONE TO WATCH IT THEY WILL SIGN BECAUSE HIS UNCLE HADN'T YET REOPENED. WE ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES OF MANY THAT WE'VE HEARD WITHIN THE LAST FEW MONTHS. PANDEMIC A CLOSE CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS AND DAYCARES AND MADE IT UNSAFE FOR EXTENDED FAMILY OR OTHER DAY PROGRAM TO PROVIDE BACK UP HERE. IN THE CALIFORNIA PARENTS OF SMALL CHILDREN HAVE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO PROVIDE THAT CARE. BUT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THE CALIFORNIA AN ADEQUATE PROTECTION THESE PARENTS CHOICE THE- CHOICE AND NOT LEAVE SMALL CHILDREN UNATTENDED AT HOME. CAN RESULT IN THE LOSS OF THEIR JOBS. THIS BILL WOULD PREVENT THAT THE WELL BEING OF CALIFORNIA'S NEXT GENERATION MATTERS TO ALL OF US AND THAT'S WHY WE MUST ENSURE THAT CHILDREN TO RECEIVE THE ADEQUATE CARE THAT THEY NEED. IT DOESN'T DEPEND ON THE SIZE OF THEIR PARENTS EMPLOYER. AND SOMETIMES THAT CAN LAST FOR MORE THAN FORTY HOURS. SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE WILL ALLOW PARENTS TO TAKE UNPAID TIME OFF WITHOUT LOSING THEIR JOBS WHEN AN EMERGENCY CLOSE WITH THEIR CHILD'S SCHOOL OR DAYCARE OR REQUIRES THAT THE TRIAL BE PICKED UP FROM SCHOOL OR DAYCARE. NO MATTER THE SIZE OF THEIR EMPLOYER IN FOR THE DURATION OF THE EMERGENCY THAT CREATES THAT NIGHT. WE CAN'T ALWAYS PREDICT AN EMERGENCY AND PARENTS NEED THE PROTECTION NOW AND FOR WHEN THE NEXT DISASTER STRIKES. ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL FOR STABILITY OF CALIFORNIA FAMILIES. IN CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY- TRIBUTE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST DRIVE OUT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE TESTIMONY OF WE WILL NOW MOVE TO.

GOOD AFTERNOON AND EVENING MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS BUT HAVING COME OUT FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE- WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. WE APPRECIATE WHAT THE SENATORS ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE AND WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND MANY PARENTS ARE- DEALING WITH SCHOOL IN CHILDCARE CLOSURES AT THIS TIME- AS A SENATOR INDICATED WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE SCOPE OF THE BILL WE HAD A GOOD VERY GOOD MEETING WITH THE SENATOR'S OFFICE ON MONDAY. IS TO POINT OUT THIS BILL MAKES TO PERMANENT CHANGES TO THE ENTIRE. SECTION OF THE LABOR CODE- DEALING WITH THE SCHOOL RELATED. LEAVES THAT WE THINK MAY BE BROADER THAN IS NECESSARILY. NECESSARY TO DEAL WITH THE CURRENT CRISIS OR- A SIMILAR WILD FIRE ISSUES- IT DOES REMOVE THE TWENTY FIVE OR MORE EMPLOYEES THRESHOLD. IT DOES SO FOR THIS ENTIRE LABOR CODE SECTION NOT JUST THESE- ADDITIONAL A STATE OF EMERGENCIES AND IT REMOVES THE FORTY HOUR CAP AGAIN FOR ALL. EMERGENCY SITUATIONS NOT JUST- THE STATE OF EMERGENCY SITUATIONS SO. THE CURRENT STATUTE DEFINES EMERGENCIES TO INCLUDE DISCIPLINARY REASONS SO THIS WOULD REMOVE THE FORTY HOUR CAP FOR DISCIPLINARY REASONS WHICH- WE DON'T NECESSARILY THINK REQUIRES THE SAME LEVEL- OF TIME. AS THE- OTHER TYPES OF LEADS. JUST A NOTE ON THE STATE OF EMERGENCIES WE'VE HAD SOME DISCUSSION EARLIER- OFTEN THE STATE EMERGENCIES ARE ON THE BOOKS FOR A VERY LONG TIME. SOME OF THE WILD FIRE STATE OF EMERGENCIES FROM TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ARE STILL IN A FACT- AND IN DECEMBER OF THIS YEAR GOVERNOR NEWSOME JUST TERMINATED SEVENTY- EMERGENCY DECLARATIONS THAT HAD BEEN. ONGOING SINCE- DATING BACK TO TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN SO SOMETIMES THESE EMERGENCIES JUST STATE OPEN AND SO I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S THE PROPER METRIC WE SHOULD BE LOOKING OUT HERE PERHAPS WE CAN LOOK AT. WHEN THE SCHOOL CLOSURE- IS IN DURATION RELATION TO THE THEY EMERGENCY RATHER THAN THAT THE DECLARATION ITSELF- SO WE WILL LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE SENATOR WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS BASED ON ALL THE PLETHORA OF LEAVE PROVISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ENACTED IN RECENT WEEKS. AND MONTHS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL DEALING WITH SCHOOL CLOSURES- IN MANY STE THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND WE HAVE SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT- PENDING LEE PROPOSALS IN THE ASSEMBLY AS WELL. THAT WOULD COVER THIS SITUATION AS WELL SO WEIRD WE WANT TO FIND A WAY TO FIND OUT HOW ALL THESE LEE PROVISIONS ARE GOING TO INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER- FOR THOSE REASONS WERE OPPOSE BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE SENATOR. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE TESTIMONY ANYONE ELSE IN ROOM FORTY TWO OR THREE WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. TO A SB. THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE SEE NO ONE WILL MOVE TO ROOM TWENTY FORTY IS THERE ANYONE IN TWENTY FORTY WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION.

THERE ARE NO FURTHER OPPOSITION COMMON. MOTOR YOU CAN YOU PLEASE CHECK THE LINE ONCE AGAIN TO BE SURE WE HAVE HEARD FROM ALL OF THE OPPOSITION WITNESSES. AND ONCE AGAIN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE. PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. THERE ARE NO FOR THEIR OPPOSITION COMMON THANK YOU MODERATOR THANK YOU ALL THE SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION WITNESSES. WHEN I BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I THINK COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS YES SENATOR PENN. THANK YOU CENTER- JACKSON- APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO. I GUESS MY CONCERN IS THAT- THE SIZE OF THE BUSINESS SO YOUR LIMINE TWENTY FIVE ESSENTIALLY MAKING IT. SINCE THE ONE. AND YOU KNOW MY FAMILY WERE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS- WHAT- WE'VE AT ONE POINT I HAD A TIME WHERE WE HAD AN EMPLOYEE WHO WAS OUT FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD TIME WHERE WE KEPT. THEM PLEASE JOB OPEN WHILE THEY WERE GONE IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT AND VERY EXPENSIVE TO DO THAT- IT'S NOT EASY BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHEN SOMEONE IS OUT AND YOU HOLD YOUR JOB. THEN YOU CAN'T OFFER THE PERSON WHO'S GONNA BE FILLING IN FOR THEM ESPECIALLY THE SMALL BUSINESSES THE MORE CRITICAL EVERYBODY IS. TO BE ABLE TO SAY WELL I CAN GIVE A JOB BECAUSE WHEN THAT PERSON COMES BACK I CAN AFFORD TO OF THEM I CAN ONLY AFFORD ONE RIGHT SO THAT MEANS WHOEVER YOU BRING IN IS CERTAINLY NOT GONNA BE COMMITTED TO YOUR BUSINESS. THEY'RE IN THERE TO YOU KNOW THAT MEAN THEIR DOCTOR TO WORK AND THEY'LL DO WHAT THEY CAN BUT IT'S REALLY HARD TO TRAIN THEM BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY'RE NOT STAYING IT'S REALLY HARD TO RETAIN THEM BECAUSE AS SOON AS THEY HAVE A JOB THAT'S MORE PERMANENT THERE OFTEN GUY AND THEN YOU HAVE TO FIND SOMEONE ELSE. FOR NOW THE EVEN SHRINKING DAY ON THAT THE REMAINING TIME AT CETERA. SO ANY I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND- IS A- IS A- OF A FATHER AND SOMEONE TO IN TERMS OF ON THE OTHER SIDE- BUT ALSO WANTED. THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW THE LOW WE WILL ONLY KEEPING THE JOB AS LONG AS A BUSINESS STILL EXISTS RIGHT AND I THINK WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE HELP THE BUSINESSES TO ESPECIALLY START GETTING SMALL SO MAYBE TWENTY FIVE THEY CAN HANDLE IT I DON'T KNOW MAYBE SMALLER BUT- I MEAN WE START GETTING DOWN TO. LIKE YOU JUST HAVE A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE AND DEPENDING ON WHAT BUSINESS YOU'RE AND HEALTHIER ONE THAT BRINGS A LITTLE MORE REVENUE. MAYBE NOT SO MUCH OF AN ISSUE BUT IT AGAIN IT. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A HOLE IN YOUR STAFF AND THAT'S A CRITICAL AND YOU HAVE A VERY SMALL STAFF EVERYONE'S CRITICAL AND YOU TRY YOU YOU TRY TO BE FLEXIBLE AND SO FORTH. BUT CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP THE BUSINESS ARE IS THERE SOME OTHER THRESHOLD. MEANS REALLY GOING TO BE DOWN THE ONE BECAUSE I AM REALLY I AM CONCERNED- AND ABOUT AND CERTAINLY COVERT NOW IT'S MORE BLANKET ACROSS EVERYONE BUT EAT YOU KNOW EVEN BEYOND COVE IT. KNOWING WHAT HOW HARD IT WAS FOR A BUSINESS- FIRST HAND TO TRY TO. CONTINUE TO STAFF A POSITION WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO HOLD OPEN FOR SOMEONE TO KEEP THEIR JOB HOW HARD IT WAS TO ACTUALLY. DO THAT AND ALSO KIND OF EXPENSIVE TO DO YOU DON'T HAVE TO OFFER REGULATORY FIND A TEMP AGENCY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND WE JUST IT WAS REALLY HARD TO TRY TO FIND. PEOPLE TO FILL THAT POSITION SO CAN YOU TO STRESS THANK YOU. WELL AGAIN REMEMBER WE'RE TALKING A- IS. OF THE- WARD. ABOUT A CATASTROPHIC EVENT. WHETHER IT'S LOCAL. STATEWIDE OR NATIONAL SO WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT A SITUATION WHERE SOMEBODY- IT THE SAYS I NEED TO TAKE SOME TIME OFF AND IT. IT'S AN EXTENDED PERIOD TIME AND I'M SYMPATHETIC TO AYE I ACTUALLY. HAVE A SMALL BUSINESS I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU'VE GOT. YOU'VE GOT A DOUBLE TIME FOR SOMEONE WHO'S OUT. BUT WE'RE TALKING NOW ABOUT SITUATIONS WHERE SCHOOLS CLOSE WERE TO YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T JUST THE- THE BUT LIFE GOES ON TYPE OF THING THAT CAN HAPPEN THIS IS A CATACLYSMIC. EVENT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL COVERS. AND YOU KNOW IT AT SOME POINT FRANKLY. IF WE HAVE THIS UNIQUE SITUATION WHICH MAY NOT. BE UNIQUE GOING FORWARD DRAGGING A WE RECOGNIZE THERE ARE VIRUSES AND- WE HAD SARS AND WE HAD THE EACH ONE AND ONE AND WE WERE LUCKY THERE TO. TO CONTAIN THAT BUT THIS REALLY DEALS WITH THE SITUATION WHERE SCHOOLS ARE CLOSED- AND PARENTS ARE CHEST ON ABLE- OR WE ARE FORCING THEM TO DECIDE THAT THEY GO TO WORK. OR DO THEY QUIT THEIR JOB AND STAY HOME WITH THEIR KIDS AND THEN IF THAT'S THE CASE. HOW TO THE GOOD GET BACK INTO THE WORKFORCE SO- CERTAINLY. HAPPY TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION- ON THE SIZE OF THIS BUT WHAT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT NOW WITH HIS IF YOU'RE AN EMPLOYEE- AND THERE'S A PANDEMIC. AND YOU JUST HAPPENED TO BE UNLUCKY ENOUGH TO WORK FOR A SMALL EMPLOYER. THAT. AND SO- I MEAN THIS IS A DISCUSSION THAT WILL CONTINUE TO. TO HAVE GOING FORWARD- BUT IT DOES ADDRESS A- LARGE SALE PROBLEM AND NOT SORT OF- YOU KNOW I HAVE A STAFFER WHO. NEEDS OF ACCOMMODATIONS THIS IS SO FAR BEYOND AN ACCOMMODATION THIS IS A CRISIS WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY SUCH WIDE IT CALLS FOR AN EMERGENCY. AND OF COURSE WE CAN WORK ON- WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT AN EIGHT YEAR EMERGENCY WE'RE TALKING BUT WHAT HAPPENS ESSENTIALLY WHEN OUR SOCIAL SAFETY NETWORK COLLAPSES. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE. I GUESS SAID NO IT CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE HOW THOSE DISCUSSIONS GO I THINK IT I THINK IT WAS REFERENCE THAT THE DECLARATION WRITTEN AND I REALIZED WHAT TRIGGERS THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY THE SCHOOLS BEING CLOSED SO IT'S NOT JUST A STATE OF EMERGENCY SO I REALIZE SOME IS THE EMERGING LAST A LONG TIME. SCHOOLS GENERAL TRY TO GET BACK OPEN WHEN THEY CAN'T. AT THE SAME TIME- DEPENDING AGAIN ON THE NATURE OF THE BUSINESS IF THEY'RE DOING. LIKE VITAL SAYING THIS- IT CETERA I MEAN I AM. I JUST THINK THAT THERE IS- HAVING SEEN WHAT'S LIKE ON THE OTHER SIDE TOO I MEAN I'VE SEEN WHAT BOTH SIDES- TRY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE- BECAUSE IT SAID IN THE END THE PERSON'S. JOB MILLER SAYING WITHOUT PROMISE SOMEONE THERE TO HAVE A JOB TO COME BACK TO. WE DON'T KNOW A WHOLE LOT YOU KNOW THAT OBVIOUSLY THIS ASKED WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG SUMMER LONGER SHORTER. THAN THE PROBLEM IS THAT- THE BUSINESS OWNER MAY END UP IN A SITUATION WHERE IT IS LIKE OKAY WELL NOT ONLY DO YOU KNOW OKAY I CAN'T KEEP YOUR JOB OPENED BUT THE ONLY WAY I CAN. DEAL WITH THIS IS ACTUALLY JUST SHUT DOWN MY TIRE BUSINESS AND EVERYONE IS THEIR JOB NOW WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT BIG YOU KNOW. COMPANY BUT BASICALLY IS BUT BASS TO THE ACT I JUST CAN'T MAKE IT WORK ANYMORE AND I THINK THAT- BECAUSE I HAVE TO YOU KNOW EITHER I VIOLATE THE LAW ARE PROMISED A PERSON THE JOB BACK BUT YET I CAN'T FUNCTION BECAUSE I CAN'T AFFORD TO. THE PERSON WHO FILLS IN THE HOLE AND I THINK THAT'S THE CHALLENGE OF LOOKING AT LEAST TIGHTLY CERTAIN OF A REALLY SMALL BUSINESS RIGHT WHEN IT'S A LETTER TWENTY FIVE IS. YOU KNOW MAYBE CAN STATE AND I I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE LINE IS WE'RE NOT TALKING OBVIOUSLY BIGGER BUSINESSES BECAUSE THE LINE CURRETLY TWENTY FIVE. BUT IT I AM CONCERNED THAT. KILLED SMALLER THE BUSINESS GET. GETS THE MORE CHALLENGING AND ALSO BY THE WAY WHEN YOU REALLY SMALL BUSINESS YOU ARE YOU CAN. YOU DO. MORE I MEAN. IF YOUR EMPLOYEES ARE NOT LIKE SOME NAMELESS PERSON I MEAN AT THAT POINT. YOU'RE WORKING SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH THEM YOU HAVE THAT REALLY SHOULD YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TRY. FOR MOST PART AT LEAST AND PLAY PROBABLY WAS ONE WANT TO COME BACK OF THEM PLAY REALLY DIDN'T CARE AT ALL ABOUT THEIR EMPLOYEES WHEN YOU HAVE TO. BASICALLY WORK FACE TO FACE EVERY DAY IN THE WAY THAT A VERY SMALL BUSINESS WOULD HAVE TO WORK. AGAIN WE'RE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A CATACLYSMIC SITUATION FOR PROBABLY EVERYBODY- SO THAT THE- THAT THE ONE PERSON ISN'T GOING TO MAKE OR BREAK A BUSINESS LIKE WHAT WE'RE HAVING NOW WITH WITH SITUATIONS WHERE. BUSINESSES ARE LITERALLY CLOSE THEY CAN'T DO BUSINESS. WHAT FLOOD. WELL CLOSE IT'S CLOSE THE RIGHT CREDIT BUT IT. IS THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND I PRE. YOUR AND CERTAINLY. LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING DISCUSSIONS. THANK YOU. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE SENATOR DR YEAH I JUST THINK WAS THAT YOUR CLOTHES WHICH THAT CLOSE TO ME JUST ADD TO IT THE THAT. AGAIN WE HAVE THIS DILEMMA THIS HOBSON'S CHOICE DO I TAKE CARE OF MY CHILDREN TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE. YOU KNOW THERE'S NOT SCHOOL I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DO WITH THESE KIDS AT THAT POINT WHERE DO I GO TO WORK AND LEAVE THEM AT HOME- OR DO I QUIT MY JOB BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THAT OPTION SO. THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE WE REALLY NEED TO CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS BECAUSE IT'S A- IT IS A LOSING CHOICE ON EITHER SIDE. SO WITH THAT I WOULD THE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. I AM COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE BILL AND TO WE NEED TO FIND. A WAY TO MAKE THOSE ACCOMMODATIONS RECOGNIZING THE VARIOUS CONCERNS AND INTERESTS THAT ARE INVOLVED. IN THANK YOU FOR THAT FOR SAYING THAT BECAUSE I AGREE WITH SENATOR PANTS COMMENTS AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER AND THE CHALLENGES THAT ONE FACES AT THE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE AT THAT. CRITICAL FIVE PERSONS THREE PERSON EIGHT PER WHATEVER THAT SMALL NUMBER IS IT'S VERY DELICATE. BALANCE OF. PROVIDING THE WORK. THE LABOR AND THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES BECAUSE IT'S- THERE'S A FINE LINE ACROSS THERE AND I THINK THE OPPOSITION AND THEY WERE LATE. COMING IN ON FRIDAY. BUT THEY'VE RATE SOME I THINK SOME SOME SOME LEGITIMATE CONCERNS SO I AM HAPPY TO CERTAIN OF SUPPORT THE BILL BECAUSE I THINK YOU DID DESERVES A CONVERSATION. BUT YOU KNOW WE GET TO THE FOR WE'LL SEE HOW IT WORKS OUT AND IF I CAN SUPPORT THEM SO. THANK YOU THANK YOU. IS THERE A MOTION. SUMMARY THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL WE HAVE A MOTION TO PAST. APPROPRIATIONS PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FOR PLEASE TURN ON YOUR MICROPHONE IN ORDER TO VOTE SENATOR HILL. BY SENATOR HILL HI SENATOR MORALE. SENATOR JACKSON HI SENATOR JACKSON HI SENATOR MITCHELL HI CENTER MITCHELL HI SENATOR PAN. THE BILL HAS THREE BOAT IT IS OUT THANK YOU IN THIS ISSUE THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON FOR THAT AND NOW THANK YOU ALSO FOR NOW DO TAKING OUR NEXT ITEM SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY FOR YOUR PRESENT IN THE BILL FOR SENATOR MONEY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR DOING THAT IT'S AGAIN PLEASE PERCENT STRICKEN WE AND HIS WITNESS IS ON THE LINE. RIGHT NOW. SO MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS UNDER EXISTING LAW THE LABOR COMMISSIONER PLAYS AN ADJUDICATORY ROLE IN THE BERMAN HEARING. A BERMAN HEARING TAKES PLACE WHEN A WAGE CLAIM IS FILED BY AN EMPLOYEE. THERE AFTER IF THE BERMAN HEARING RESULT IN AN ORDER DECISION OR AWARD OTHERWISE KNOWN AS A NO DNA. IN FAVOR OF THE CLAIMANT. AND THE EMPLOYER. FILES AID TO NOVO APPEAL SAY THEY DON'T THEY DON'T LIKE THE DECISION- THEY GET TO FILE A DE NOVO APPEAL IN THE SUPERIOR COURT. AND THE CLAIMANT CANNOT AFFORD PRIVATE COUNSEL SO THE LABOR COMMISSIONER IS REQUIRED TO REPRESENT THE CLAIMANT. IN THE TO NOBLE PROCEEDING. EXISTING REGULATION DOES NOT PROVIDE AUTHORIZATION FOR THE LABOR COMMISSIONER TO REPRESENT A WAGE CLAIMANT. UNLESS THERE HAS BEEN A BERMAN HEARING AND THE RESULTING ORDER DECISION OR AWARD IN THE CLAIMANTS FAVOR. THUS A WAGE CLAIM AND FORCED TO ARBITRATE A WAGE CLAIM AND PROHIBITED FROM HAVING THE CLAIM HEARD AND DECIDED BY THE LABOR COMMISSIONER. IS DEPRIVED OF THE RIGHT TO NO CONTEST A NO COST REPRESENTATION OFTEN CLAIMANTS CANNOT AFFORD PRIVATE COUNSEL AND FACE A HIGHER PROSPECT OF THE DEFEAT IN ARBITRATION. OR THEY SETTLE THEIR CLAIMS AT A SUBSTANTIAL DISCOUNT THIS MEASURE WOULD UPDATE EXISTING LAW TO ALLOW CLAIMANTS TO RECEIVE NO COST REPRESENTATION FROM THE LABOR COMMISSIONER COMMISSIONER IN AN ARBITRAL PROCEEDING. SO THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THE INCREASING USE OF MANDATORY ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS WHICH SOME OF US DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE BUT THAT'S WHAT WE ARE SEEING A PARTICULARLY IN AN EMPLOYMENT CONTEXT. AND IT WOULD ALLOW THE DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT TO REPRESENT WAGE CLAIMANTS IN THOSE PROCEEDINGS WHEN THEY'RE UNABLE TO RESOLVE THE CLAIM DURING A BERMAN HEARING. SO AGAIN THIS A RARE IT KNOWLEDGE TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE OCCURRING AND IT TO A PROVIDES THE CLAIMANT WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO REPRESENTATION HOPING OF COURSE THAT THESE ALL GET RESOLVED. AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE STAGE BECAUSE EVERY TIME YOU DE NOVO SOMETHING IT GOES THE SUPERIOR COURT. AND WE KNOW PARTICULARLY THE COURTS ARE GOING TO BE JAM ONCE THEY RE OPEN- AND AFTER- THE CODED- EMERGENCY IS A PASSIVE SO- THIS DOES HAVE BOTH THE COLD WOULD END OF FAIRNESS ASPECT TO IT- AND- ARE WITH MY WITNESS ORDERED. AS CENTER MONIES WITNESS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL MARIE GO YOSHIHARA THE POLICY DIRECTOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION- IS ON. THE LINE READY TO TESTIFY. OUR ALL RIGHT WE CAN GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THIS IS MERRY GO USUALLY CAR WITH THE CALIFORNIA PLAN THAT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION CLEAR AND STRONG SUPPORT OF THE THIRTEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND WANT TO THANK SENATOR MONEY OR GREEN XBOX OR- SENATOR JEFF TALK TO MENTION THE BILL HOW DOES HELP RESPOND TO THE EVER EXPANDING NATURE FORCED ARBITRATION CLAUSES THAT MOST WORKERS NOW FIND IN THEIR EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS. MANY PEOPLE REALLY ARE SHOCKED TO LEARN THAT FORCED ARBITRATION CLAUSES NOT ONLY PREVENT WORKERS FROM FILING A CLAIM IN COURT BUT IT CAN ALSO PREVENT THEM FROM ACCESSING THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE. AND I JUST WANT TO TOUCH ON ONE WE CAN CASE THAT I THINK ILLUSTRATES WHY THIS BILL IS SO IMPORTANT I'M IN THIS CASE THE WORKER FILE THE WAGE CLAIM WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE AND WAS AWARDED HUNDRED TO TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IN UNPAID WAGES SB FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS THE MIGRATED TO DAMAGE AND. INTEREST AND PENALTIES. WHERE TO COMPEL BUT- BE THE WORK HAD BEEN FORCED TO SIGN IN OUR- AGREEMENT AS A CONDITION OF THE- LUCKILY THE LABOR COMMISSIONER ENTERED. TO OPPOSE THE- TO COMPEL THIS RECORD ARGUS. THANK YOU TRY TO BAKER HIS THE WAY OF THE LATE COMMISSIONER'S. THAT THE SUPREME COURT WILL ON A- ACTUALLY WHETHER THE- AGREEMENT WAS UNCONSCIONABLE. AND FOUND THAT IT WAS A GRADUAL BECAUSE IT WOULD'VE FORCED THE WORKER INTO A FORM THAT WOULD BE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO NAVIGATE WITHOUT AN ATTORNEY. WELL IT WAS DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN FROM THE GREEN HOW ABOUT THE WORKER WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO FILE A CLAIM IN ARBITRATION. AND IT WOULD REQUIRE THE WORKER TO RESPOND THE FORMAL DISCOVERY DEMAND THE DISPOSITIVE MOTIONS AND FOLLOW ALL THE TECHNICAL RULES OF EVIDENCE. THE BERMAN HEARING BY CONTRAST UP THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE THE WORKER NEED ONLY FILL OUT A COMPLAINT FORM THEY HAVE EXPECTED FROM THE DEPUTY LABOR COMMISSIONER AND ALL RELEVANT OF AND IS TYPICALLY ADMITTED. THE COURT GOT IT RIGHT IN THAT CASE AND THAT WOULD THE AGREEMENT WITH UNCONSCIONABLE BUT THERE MAY BE INSTANCES WHERE A WORKER IS ACTUALLY COMPILED ARBITRATION BY THE EMPLOYER AND WE DO NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER CANNOT THAT THE- WORKERS. EITHER BY REPRESENTING THEM IN THE ARBITRATION PROCESS OR BY CHALLENGING THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE. WE KNOW WORKERS ARE ALREADY AT A DISTINCT DISADVANTAGE WHEN THEY'RE FORCED TO PURSUE THEIR CLAIM IN ARBITRATION AND IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT THAT THE DAMAGE EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED WHEN THEY'RE NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL. AND ARBITRATION DECISIONS ARE BINDING AND WORKERS CANNOT APPEAL AN ARBITRATION DECISION LIKE THEY CAN'T A COURT DECISION OR AN ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION. IT IS ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT WE PROTECT WORKERS FROM LOSING ALL OF THEIR RIGHT TO AN ARBITRATION PROCEEDING WHERE THEY ARE ON REPRESENTED. THE FOR ALL THESE. REASONS WE STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE WILL NOW MOVE TO TESTIMONY IN- PUBLIC TESTIMONY IN FORTY TWO OR THREE IS THERE ANYONE IN FORTY TWO OR THREE ROOM FORTY TWO OR THREE WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY FOUR SEEN NO ONE TO HAVE ANYONE IN ROOM TWENTY FORTY WHO WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY ON.

THAT'S RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVALS FOR FREE THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE HAVE A MOTION FROM SENATOR PAN OF PLEASE CALL THE ROLL THIS IS. TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS. BURNERS PLEASE TURN ON YOUR MICROPHONES FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE VOTE. CENTER HELP HI THERE HELLO HI CENTER MORALE. SENATOR JACKSON'S BY SENATOR JACKSON BY SENATOR MITCHELL FIVE AND MITCHELL HI CENTER PAN FIGHT. IN ORDER PAN HI. THE BILL HAS FOUR VOTES IT IS OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH EVERYONE FOR THE VOTES THAT WE WILL MOVE TO OUR FINAL ITEM OF THE DAY SENATOR TO RAZA AGAIN IN I WANT TO APOLOGIZE FOR YOUR- HAVING TO. SIT THROUGH THIS AND BE HERE IN YOUR PATIENCE TODAY BUT THAT'S THE WAY WERE WORKING THE SYSTEM RIGHT NOW. NO REASON TO APOLOGIZE. WITH THIS IS THAT YOU MAY PRESENT YOUR BILL SB THIRTEEN NINETY NINE PLEASE THANK YOU AS I'M SITTING THERE I WAS A SAYING WHAT. WHAT WHICH I BE THINKING OF ASIDE FROM MISSING YOU WALL AND SENATOR MITCHELL I'M THINKING OF THE EVENING THAT WE SPENT WITH THE GARMENT WORKERS. IN THE PICO UNION AREA AND HOW. ELATED THEY WERE. TO RECEIVE SOME OF THE LOST WAGES. TWO YEARS LATER THREE YEARS LATER SO. YEARS LATER SO I'M THINKING OF THEM RIGHT NOW. SO RIGHT NOW PRIMARILY WOMEN IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY ARE FINALLY AT HOME I WAS GONNA SAY THEY WERE AT WORK- MAKING THE PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT BUT RIGHT NOW THEY'RE AT HOME AFTER TEN TO TWELVE HOURS OF WORK MAKING PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT THAT ENABLES US TO BE HERE TODAY. AND OUR BUSINESSES AND SERVICES NEED TO REOPEN REBUILD. THE GARMENT WORKER WOMEN ARE DOING THIS SOMETIMES IN VERY HARSH CONDITIONS AND OFTEN FOR AS LITTLE AS FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR. THESE MEN AND WOMEN ARE DOING ESSENTIAL WORK THEY ARE MORE VISIBLE AND YET THEY ARE MORE VULNERABLE. MOSTLY DUE IN PART TO WIDESPREAD EXPLOITATION WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO EXPAND LIABILITY FOR WAGE THEFT IN THE GARMENT MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY. SO THIS BILL WOULD PROTECT THOSE WORKERS BY ELIMINATING THE PIECE RATE IN THAT INDUSTRY AND FORCING LIABILITY FOR WAGE VIOLATIONS. ALLOWING THE GARMENT WORKERS TESTIMONY TO MEANS SOMETHING. WHEN IT COMES TO IDENTIFYING THE GUARANTORS OR OTHER WORDS BROWN'S. AND TO EXPLICITLY AUTHORIZE THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE TO INVESTIGATE AND SITE THESE GUARANTORS. SB THIRTY NINETY NINE MAKES CLEAR THAT A BUSINESS CONTRACTING TO HAVE GARMENT MADE GARMENTS MADE IS LIABLE FOR THE UNPAID MINIMUM WAGE AND OVERTIME TO THE WORKERS WHO MANUFACTURE THE GARMENT. REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY LAYERS OF CONTRACTING THAT THAT PERSON MAY USE. RESPONSIBLE BUSINESSES WITHIN THE INDUSTRY ARE ALSO SUFFERING. DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND ENFORCEMENT OF LABOR STANDARDS WILL LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR THE RESPONSIBLE GOOD BUSINESSES IT WON'T HURT THEM. SO CALLED RETAILERS CONTRACT WITH A NETWORK OF MANUFACTURERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS TO PRODUCE THEIR GARMENTS AND THEY DICTATE THE PRICING STRUCTURE WAGE THEFT REPORT FROM UCLA DOCUMENTED THAT LOW WAGE WORKERS IN GENERAL AND IN THE LA ALONE. LOSE TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS A WEEK IN WAGE THEFT VIOLATIONS IMAGINE TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS MORE A WEEK IN THE COMMUNITIES IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE SCHOOLS WHERE THEY LIVE. SOME OF THE TWENTY FIVE LOW WAGE INDUSTRIES SURVEYED THE GARMENT INDUSTRY HAS THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF WAGE THEFT VIOLATION BY INDUSTRY. SO NOT ONLY DOES THE PRIVACY IN STRUCTURE AND LAYERS OF CONTRACTING UNDERMINE THE FORCE IN THE PURPOSE OF LAW MANUFACTURERS HAVE NO INCENTIVE. TO FOLLOW THE LAW. UNLESS THEY FACE LIABILITY. WE HAVE DO WE MUST ESTABLISH THE UPSTREAM LIABILITY SO THAT WE CAN STOP THAT THE F. THAN EXPLOITATION I'VE HEARD THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS ON SEVERAL OF MY OF MY BILL MY AUTHORS AMENDMENTS AS DETAILED ON PAGE NINE OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS REMOVES THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AND THE SECURITY BOND REQUIREMENT FROM THIS BILL SO MY COLLEAGUES I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BE THIRTEEN NINETY NINE. TODAY WE HAVE TWO EXPERTS ON THE PHONE GARMENT WORKER WITH HILDA ROLE METAL AND MATTHEW D. CARLESS FROM BED SET A LEGAL SERVICES TESTIFYING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS FOR THE TESTIMONY AND A FOR THE- COMMENTS- SENATOR DRAWS- AND- IS ROMERO.

NO FURTHER COMMENTS IN THE QUEUE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MODERATOR TO HAVING HEARD FROM THE ALL THE SUPPORTERS WILL NOW FOLLOW THE SAME PROCESS IN HERE FROM ANY OPPOSITION WILL BEGIN WITH ROOM FORTY TWO OR THREE PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS I BET HAVING COME OUT FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WERE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT BILL THAT MAKES MAJOR CHANGES TO HOW WE REGULATE- THE GARMENT MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA- THAT WAS- IMPLEMENTED OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO AND EIGHTY SIX THREE THREE ASSEMBLY MEMBER STEINBERG- THESE ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES. YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS AT THAT THE STAKEHOLDERS THE ADMINISTRATION THE COMMITTEES- YOU KNOW ARE LIMITED IN HOW MUCH ATTENTION THEY CAN DEVOTE TO THIS THIS. VERY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES A LOT I MEAN HERE IT IS IT'S EIGHT THIRTY AT NIGHT FOR THE LAST BILL TODAY ALL OF YOU WANT TO LEAVE WE HAVE THREE MINUTES TO EXPLAIN OUR CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL. WE THINK FRANKLY THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE NOT THAT IT'S NOT IMPORTANT AND WE KNOW IT'S CLOSE TO THE SENATORS HEART. WE THINK IT DESERVES A LOT MORE ATTENTION THAN ANY OF US ARE ABLE TO DEVOTE- DURING THIS CRISIS WERE TRYING TO FOCUS. ON ON VERY LIMITED LEGISLATIVE TESTIMONY AND OUTPUT. WE DO HAVE A NUMBER OF SPECIFIC CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL- WE'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT WE JUST DON'T THINK THERE'S BEEN YOU KNOW FULLER OPPORTUNITY TO FLUSH OUT THESE CONCERNS. NUMBER ONE IT ELIMINATES PIECE RATE FOR THE ENTIRE GARMENT INDUSTRY THAT'S A VERY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE THE LAW. WE GENERALLY DON'T LIMIT HOW EMPLOYERS CAN PAY WORKERS. PM HOURLY SALARY PIECE RATE AS LONG AS YOU COMPLY WITH MINIMUM WAGE AND OVERTIME AND ALL THE OTHER- REGULATIONS IT'S UP TO THE EMPLOYER HOW TO PAY WORKERS AND WE HEARD DESCRIPTIONS OF MINIMUM WAGE- VIOLATIONS AND REST. BREAK VIOLATIONS THOSE ARE ILLEGAL UNDER CURRENT LAW AND THERE SHOULD BE ENFORCED TO THE FULL EXTENT OF THE LAW. THIS BILL ALSO IMPOSES JOINT LIABILITY ON BRANDS WHICH IS A HUGE CONVERSATION WE'VE HAD HUGE DEBATES IN THIS LEGISLATURE THE LAST FEW YEARS OVER JOINT LIABILITY. AND WE HAVE FUNDAMENTAL CONCERNS ABOUT IMPOSING LIABILITY. ON ENTITIES AUTOMATICALLY WHO MAY NOT HAVE CONTROL OR KNOWLEDGE. OVER THE ACTIONS OF ANOTHER ENTITY THIS IS A HUGE POINT OF CONVERSATION THAT WE SHOULD SPEND THE TIME. DISCUSSING THIS BILL IMPROPERLY CREATES TWO DIFFERENT EVIDENTIARY STANDARDS AND WE WISH THIS BILL IS GOING TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WERE THANKFUL WE HAVE THIS CHAIR. HERE THIS BILL SAYS A PRESUMPTION OF JOINT LIABILITIES ESTABLISHED IF THE WORKER. I LABELS OF A BREAD. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THE EMPLOYER CANNOT DEFEND THEMSELVES WITH WRITTEN DECLARATIONS. AND SAID HAS TO PROVIDE OTHER COMPELLING AND RELIABLE WRITTEN EVIDENCE. WE THINK THIS TWO DIFFERENT. STANDARDS FOR EVIDENCE IS IMPROPER AND PROBABLY VIOLATES DUE PROCESS WE DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE IN THIS BILL. AGAIN WE DON'T HAVE A FULL OPPORTUNITY TO FLUSH THAT OUT BECAUSE THIS BILL ISN'T GOING TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. SO AGAIN THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE WE DON'T WANT TO- GIVE ANY IMPRESSION THAT IS NOT IMPORTANT ISSUE TO THE CONTRARY THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE MAKES IT VERY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE LAW. WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD SPEND THE TIME TO GET IT RIGHT- YOU KNOW SPEND PERHAPS INFORMATIONAL HEARING. TIME REALLY LOOKING AT THESE ISSUES IF WE'RE GOING TO ADOPT WHOLESALE CHANGES SUCH AS OUTLINED PIECE RATE. IMPOSING AUTOMATICALLY LIABILITY ON BRANDS- SO WE RESPECTFULLY WOULD REQUEST THAT THIS THIS THE ISSUE BEING TAKEN UP NEXT YEAR WHEN ALL OF THE PARTIES CAN DEVOTE THE PROPER ATTENTION THAT IT DESERVES. AND FOR THOSE REASONS RESPECTFULLY WERE OPPOSED THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT WAS PERFECT EXACTLY THREE MINUTES AND NOW WE WILL MOVE TO ANYONE ELSE IN THE. IN THIS ROOM. I WANTED TO SPEAK WITH ANYONE HERE AT ANYONE IN TWENTY FORTY THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO SB THIRTEEN NINETY NINE IN OPPOSITION. OKAY VERY GOOD THEN WE WILL NOW MOVE TO THE. PLEASE FROM THE INDIVIDUALS MODERATOR WAITING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OF SB THIRTEEN NINETY NINE AND THEN WE WILL BEGIN. THANK YOU AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF SB THIRTEEN NINETY NINE PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. NINE THREE SIXTY EIGHT I'M SORRY- JUST A BRIEF MOMENT HERE. NINE THREE SIXTY EIGHT PLEASE GO AHEAD. YEAH HI. YES THANK YOU- UNLESS YOU CARE MEMBERS NICOLAES CALIFORNIA AFTER GOING TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION I WON'T BE LABOR- COMICS FOR TONIGHT WHICH IS TO SAY THAT WE STRONGLY AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE CHAMBER IN WHICH YOU ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENTS IN THE QUEUE MODERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE CHECK THE LINE ONCE AGAIN TO BE SURE WE'VE HEARD FROM ALL OF THE OPPOSITION. TO SB THIRTEEN NINETY NINE. AND ONCE AGAIN IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF SB THIRTEEN NINETY NINE PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENTS IN THE QUEUE THANK YOU MODERATOR. THANK YOU FOR ALL THE SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION WITNESSES WE WANT TO BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO MEMBERS. SENATOR JACKSON'S IT'S THANK YOU- I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL I THINK THE FACT THAT WE'VE HAD LAWS ON THE BOOKS FOR TWENTY YEARS AND WE'RE STILL HEARING ABOUT RAT INFESTED RIGHT- BATHROOMS. AND PEOPLE WORKING- SIXTY FIVE HOURS A WEEK AND- GETTING PAID OF FIVE DOLLARS AND SIXTY FIVE CENTS. A BEGS THE QUESTION AS TO. WHAT IS GOING ON HERE AND I DON'T THINK WE CAN WAIT ANOTHER YEAR. TO RESOLVE THIS THERE MAY BE SOME. QUESTIONS ABOUT PROCESS AND I'M HAPPY EVEN THOUGH THE BILL DOESN'T GET TO COME TO MY COMMITTEE. TO TRY TO BE HELPFUL ENACT WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE ARE CONSISTENT THAN THAT WE PROVIDE ALL OF THE PROTECTIONS AVAILABLE BUT I FIND IT SOMEWHAT INTERESTING THAT THERE'S A CALL TO ENFORCE THE LAW TO THE MAXIMUM. EXTENT AVAILABLE EXCEPT THAT YOU HAVE TO REMOVE THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. FROM THIS BILL WHICH IS ONE OF THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS THAT ACTUALLY- OF FREQUENTLY DOES- GET COMPANIES TO TAKE THE LOSS SERIOUSLY. I'M ASSUMING RIGHT NOW WITH THIS WITH THE ONLY ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IS A- THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS IS THAT THE- AGENCY IN A COURSE THEY'RE OVERWHELMED. AND SO- THE I FIND THE PROTESTATIONS TO BE A LITTLE DISINGENUOUS FRANKLY BECAUSE- THIS IS SOMETHING NO ONE SHOULD TAUGHT WHEN WE SHOULD BE TOLERATING THIS THESE ARE STORIES WITH. THAT HAPPENED IN NINETEEN HUNDRED. WITH THE GARMENT WORKERS IN NEW YORK AND IT COULD HAPPEN IN LOS ANGELES AND- YOU KNOW YOU CAN PAY PIECEMEAL AS LONG AS IT'S A MINIMUM OF THE MINIMUM WAGE BUT THEY THE CLEARLY THAT ISN'T. WHAT'S HAPPENING AND- I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE WAITING ANY LONGER TO TRY TO FIX THAT BUT I WILL. OFFER MY ASSISTANCE AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN. WORK TOGETHER TO ADDRESS WHAT ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS BUT AS FAR AS THE RESTAURANT DELAYING AND DELAYING THIS IS. JUST AN UNCONSCIONABLE SITUATION SO I'M GOING TO MOVE THE BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME AND THANK THE OFFICE INTERJECTING OTHER COMMENTS. CONCERNS HEARING NONE. ALSO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND- ON BEHALF OF ALL OF THOSE WORKERS APPRECIATE YOUR- CONCERNS AND- LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING ON THE OTHER ISSUES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR IN MY ROOM THANK YOU VERY MUCH I AND I THINK YOU MADE SOME GOOD VERY GOOD POINTS AND WAGE THEFT IS JUST TOLERABLE AND WE KNOW WHICH IN THE INDUSTRY AND IT HAS BEEN THERE'S BEEN SUCH ABUSES AND SO THAT THERE'S SOME. SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE I APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS THAT- THEY'RE OFFERING THOSE AND PUTTING THEM IN THE BILL- IT NEEDS TO MAKE THE INDUSTRY MORE ACCOUNTABLE IN THERE BUT I DO TO IT IT IS A BIG BILL AND THERE'S A LOT IN HERE. AND I JUST WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO PLEASE WORK OVER THE NEXT WHATEVER AMOUNT OF TIME WE HAVE TO. TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION BECAUSE I REALLY DON'T WANT TO SEE THOSE RESPONSIBLE BUSINESSES HARM I MEAN THERE ARE. GOOD APPLES AND BAD AND THE GOOD ONES I DON'T WANT TO SEE THEM UNINTENTIONALLY HARMED BY THIS BILL SO I HOPE THAT WE CAN SEE SOME OF SOME PROGRESS ON THAT AS WELL SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION FROM SENATOR JACKSON.
