AS MANY OF US SAID LAST YEAROF DIE HOUSING PACKAGE OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHILE A SIGNIFICANT STEP FORWARD WAS A DOWN PAYMENT ON A PROBLEM THAT HAS BEEN GROWING FOR DECADES IT WILL TAKE US YEARS TO GET OUT OF.

OKAY SEEN NONE ONE A WE I GO STRAIGHT TO THE FIRST PANEL WE HAVE ALL THE HEADS OF TWO OF THE MAJOR STATE AGENCIES THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR. IMPLEMENTING. OR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN HOUSING PACKAGE. MISTER MAC HEALTH. THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND TEAR BOOKMAN PATTERSON WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CAL. HFA. WITHOUT. ONE I TURN IT OVER TO A DIRECT CONNECT HEALTH. GOOD AFTERNOON A TERRIBLE CHAIRMAN CHU AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE IT'S. A REAL HONOR TO BE ABLE TO CHAT WITH YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE WORK WE'RE DOING AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT HOUSING COMMUTED ELEMENT. AND IS WAS A PERSON I REALLY APPRECIATE THE SPARE PARTITION COLLABORATION THAT WE'VE ENJOYED WITH YOU ALL AND YOUR STAFF AND OTHER WORK THAT THE LIES AHEAD OF US. BUT LET ME START. BY PUTTING A SLIDE UP HERE DIGITAL CONTEXT OR ON THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING. AND THIS IS NOT AN UNFAMILIAR DATA POINT TO THOSE OF YOU WORKING ON HOUSING ISSUES BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT FOR. DECADES NOW CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN UNDER BUILDING HOMES ESPECIALLY MULTI FAMILY HOUSING. RELATIVE TO WHAT WE KNOW WE'VE NEEDED TO PUTTING ONLINE. WE PROJECT. A A NEED FOR A MINIMUM OF A HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND NEW HOMES ANNUALLY. JUST TO KEEP UP WITH ARE PROJECTED GROWTH HOWEVER. IF PAST IS PROLOGUE. WE HAVE SOME CAUSE FOR CONCERN WE'VE ONLY AVERAGED APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY THOUSAND HOMES EACH OF THE. PREVIOUS YEARS OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST DECADE. AND THAT'S LESS THAN HALF WHAT WE ARE BUILDING IN MOST THE TWENTY CENTURY. WHEN OUR BASS POPULATION HERE CALIFORNIA WAS MUCH LOWER. BUT UNDER PRODUCTION OF TIGHT SUPPLY OF COURSE HAS ALSO BEEN EXACERBATED BY THE EVENTS OF THE FALL WITH THE NATURAL DISASTERS VERTICALLY THAT IMPACTED THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AREA. I TAKING OFF LINE. ALMOST AS MANY HOMES IN ONE FELL SWOOP AS ARE BUILT IN TYPICAL YEAR IN THE ENTIRE BAY AREA. THESE. NUMBERS. BEAR OUT AS WELL IN TERMS OF THE EFFECT THAT THEY HAVE ARE HOMELESS POPULATION WE NOW HAVE THE DUBIOUS DISTINCTION OF HAVING THE HIGHEST RATE OF HOMELESSNESS. OF ANY STATE IN THE NATION. WE SEE OUR FIRST TIME HOMEOWNERS. TYPICALLY MILLENNIALS AND. FOLKS REPRESENTING COMMUNITIES OF COLOR BEING PRICED OUT THE MARKET. DID RISING COSTS. WE SEE THE GAP BETWEEN AVERAGE INCOMES AN ACTUAL RENTS CONTINUE TO WIDEN WITH TODAY. NOW ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS UNABLE TO ACCESS RENTAL ASSISTANCE IN PAYING. MORE THAN HALF THEIR INCOME. AND HOUSING COSTS EVERY MONTH. A AS THE BOTH OF THE. CHAIRMAN NOTED. WELL LAST YEAR. WAS. ENCOURAGING WE MADE SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS. IN TERMS OF PUTTING TOGETHER A PACKAGE OF BILLS IDENTICALLY THAT THAT. BEHIND NANCY AND DAVID THERE. NANCY SKINNER THAT'S ME IN THE BACK. DO WE KNOW. THANK YOU YOU HAVE A LITTLE JOKE YOU'RE LE. AND. WHAT WAS A PARTICULARLY I THINK? IMPRESSIVE WAS THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE IN THIS PACKAGE THAT THERE WAS AND IS NO SILVER BULLET TO ADDRESSING THE DECADES OF SHORTAGE THAT WE'VE HAD. BUT RATHER A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH WAS NEEDED WITH WITH STREAMLINING WITH THE FORCE OF WITH PRESERVATION. AND OF COURSE WITH FUNDING. I'M I'M NOT GONNA GO THROUGH. THE SPECIFICS OF ALL OF THESE BILLS. THAT WERE BUNDLED TOGETHER. BUT WILL KNOW. THAT. THEY COVER THE GAMUT FROM THE WORKING LOCAL APPROVAL PROCESS SEIZE. INCREASING OUR STATE ENFORCEMENT ONTO EXISTING HOUSING OBLIGATIONS WORKING TO ASSURE THAT WE'RE NOT LOSING. ANY OF THE FOUR WHEEL HOUSING INVESTMENTS THAT WE'VE HISTORICALLY MADE. AND OF COURSE IDENTIFYING NEW FUNDING SOURCES THAT CAN ADDRESS ISSUES LIKE HOMELESSNESS LIKE RENTAL HOUSING LIKE AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET IN JANUARY ALSO OFFERS. ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO THE DEPARTMENT BUT TO ENSURE THAT IN FACT WE CAN. PROMPTLY AND EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT THE HOUSING PACKAGE. BUT IT THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDES REQUESTS FOR NEW POSITIONS. ADVANCE PREPARATION ON A QUARTERLY BASIS FOR THE PERMANENT SOURCE FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO. PUT THAT MONEY UP FASTER. APPROPRIATE THIRTY TO BEGIN WORK IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE PASSAGE OF SB THREE THE BOND. AS WELL AS FUNDS TO DEVELOP OF A FEE COST STUDY TO BRING BACK RECOMMENDATIONS THE LEGISLATURE. FOR FURTHER CHANGE THAT WE CAN MAKE UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF AB EIGHT SEVENTY NINE. AND IN FACT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS PACKAGE OF BILLS YOU'LL SEE THAT A FAIR AMOUNT OF WORK TO DO. WITH ASSISTANCE FROM ANY OF OUR SISTER AGENCIES COLLEGE OF FAYE. THE TREASURE DEPARTMENT CALVET OFFICE IT COVERS OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH IN OTHER STATE AGENCIES. EACH CITY WILL BE IMPLEMENTING. THESE BILLS FROM START TO FINISH. SPECIFICALLY WILL ISSUE NOTICES THE FUNDING AVAILABILITY FOR SP TWO SP THREE AND ALL PROGRAMS THERE AND. FOR S. B. FIVE FORTY FOUR AB SEVENTY THREE. WILL BE DEVELOPING IMPLEMENTING GUIDELINES FOR. AS BE TWO AND THREE AS WELL AS THE S. B. THIRTY FIVE FIVE FORTY SEVEN THREE AB IT'S ONLY NINE MAYBE FIFTEEN TWENTY ONE. AND FOR ALL THE BILL'S THE PACKAGE WILL BE WORKING AS BEST WE CAN'T PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THROUGH A VARIETY VEHICLES TO HELP FOLKS. AS THEY WORK TO IMPLEMENT THESE NEW AUTHORITIES. NOW WE ARE DON'T DO THIS ALONE THAT A CITY. WE START A PRESUMPTION THAT THIS WORK A IS IS ROOTED AND. EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN UNDER WAY FOR AWHILE. AND OR INFORMED BY PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. ALL THIS PAST DECEMBER WE DEVELOPED A RESOURCE SECTION UP ON OUR WEBSITE THAT DEDICATED TO THE HOUSING PACKAGE. WITH OVER VIEWS OF EACH THE BILL'S AT AN EMAIL ADDRESS FOR SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. THERE ARE TO THE SERVICE A RESOURCE TO THE PUBLIC. AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR WE STARTED A PROCESS OF REACHING OUT OF FORMALLY TO STAKEHOLDERS FOR. A ONE ON ONE INTERVIEWS APRENDIDO SMALL FACILITY FOCUS GROUPS. PARTNERING WITH VARIOUS. HOUSING AND STAKEHOLDER ORGANIZATIONS TO BEGIN TO COLLECT SOME OF THE INITIAL INPUT AND FEEDBACK. EARLIER THIS MONTH WE ALSO UPLOADED TO OUR WEB PAGE. A FIRST BATCH OF WEEKLY ASK QUESTIONS TRYING TO GET AHEAD OF SOME OF THE ISSUES THE PARTY STARTED COMMAND. AS WELL AS PUTTING UP A SERIES OF MILESTONES THAT WE ANTICIPATE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EACH OF THESE. A NEW LOS. WOW THIS SPRING WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE AS ROBUSTLY AS WE CAN. WITH A VARIETY OF HOUSING CONFERENCES AND FORUMS. WE DO PLATYPUS PEYTON RESULT PUBLIC FORUMS. THROUGH THE SUMMER. AND THEN. STARTING IN JULY. OUR EACH CD ITSELF WILL BEGIN THE PROCESS OF PUTTING TOGETHER IN A MORE FORMAL WAY A WORKSHOPS A. THE PUBLIC COMMENT OPPORTUNITIES ON GUIDELINES AND NOTICES A FUNDING AVAILABILITY AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE DOCUMENTS. THIS WORK WILL FOLLOW A. A. BUT THE TRADITION THAT WE HAVE HAD A CD OF ROBUST PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT FROM START TO FINISH IN TERMS OF DEVELOPING FINE TUNING AND HONING OUR PROGRAMS INVESTMENTS AND AUTHORITIES. HERE ON THE SLIDE IS AN EXAMPLE OF SOME OF THE RESOURCES AND NEW INFORMATION THAT WE'VE BEGUN TO MAKE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. A HOUSING BILL SUMMARY FRICKLEY ASK QUESTIONS OF INFORMATION PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT OPPORTUNITIES. HOUSING PRODUCTION DATA. AND OUR INTENTION IS TO CONTINUE TO KEEP US UPDATED ON ONGOING FASHION WITH NEW RESOURCES INFORMATION. AND ANSWER QUESTIONS AS THEY COME IN. WE GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING THAT WE PUT OFF RECENTLY. BUT THIS IS OUR. METHODOLOGY AND DETERMINATION LIST FOR SENATE BILL THIRTY FIVE. THIS DETERMINATION LIST WAS NOT NECESSARY FOR THE BILL AND ORDERS TRUMAN IN WHICH CITIES WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE S. B. THIRTY FIVE AUTHORITY. BUT IN FACT THE WORK THAT SPRUNG FROM IT. SPRING FROM A YEAR LONG EFFORT BY THE DEPARTMENT. TO BEGIN TO MOVE MORE HOUSING DATA TO OPEN SOURCE FORMAT. OUR HOUSING ELEMENT OPEN DATA PROJECT ACTUALLY HAS TWO DATA TOOLS EMBEDDED IN IT THAT INCREASE THE TRANSPARENCY OF HOUSE CITIES ARE PLANNING. FOR THE HOUSING THAT THEY INTEND TO PROVIDE TO MEET THE HOUSING GOALS. AND ALSO HOW THEY'RE ACTUALLY PERFORMING IN REAL TIME IN TERMS MEETING KNUCKLES AND PERMITTING ADDITIONAL UNITS. WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE ON THIS MAP OF CAN'T SEE IT VERY CLEARLY BUT I HAVE A COUPLE OF WILL BLOW UPS OF THE BAY AREA AS WELL AS OF LOS ANGELES? AND OTHER REGIONS ARE AVAILABLE ON THE WEBSITE THAT ACTUALLY SHOW GRAPHICALLY. THAT TODAY. ARE TOOL SUGGESTS THAT SEVENTY PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA JURISDICTIONS. ARE FALLING BEHIND IN TERMS OF DELIVERING ON. MULTIPLE CATEGORIES OF HOUSING THAT THEIR REAL HOUSE NEEDS ALLOCATIONS. INDICATING IS PROVIDING FOR. AND NINETY SEVEN PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA JURISDICTION SO BASICALLY THE ENTIRE STATE. IS FALLING BEHIND. AND IS OFF PIECE FOR AT LEAST ONE OF THEIR SIX CYCLE REGIONAL HOUSING NEED ALLOCATION GOALS. WERE ALSO ESPECIALLY PROUD TO BE. IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAMS IDENTIFIED UNDER THE BUILDING JOBS AND HOME ACT. TO. AND AS A REMINDER. THAT LAW. PURSUANT TO STATUTE AYE DIVIDES UP THE FUNDING AND THE RECEIPTS THAT ARE COLLECTED THROUGH THE PERMIT WERE WERE. PRODUCTIVE RECORDING FEE. EQUALLY DURING THE FIRST YEAR WITH HALF GOING TO STATE ADMINISTER PLANTING PLANNING GRANTS TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. AT HALF GOING TO HOMES PROGRAMS. THE PLAN GRANTS. WILL BE A RESOURCE FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES TO OUR CAPACITY. AROUND PLANNING AND ZONING ORDER PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS. SO THEY CAN STREAMLINED HOUSING PRODUCTION. PROGRAMS ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS WILL BE MINISTER STATEWIDE AND WE'LL ALL BE OFFERED A FOR JURISDICTIONS AND FOR DEVELOPERS TO APPLY FOR THOSE FUNDS TO ADDRESS THE RISING RATE OF HOMELESSNESS. THIS IS AN EXCITING. NOT LAW THAT THIS IS A PERMANENT GUARANTEED ONGOING FUNDING SOURCE FOR HOUSING. SO YOU SEE TO THE RIGHT AS WELL OF THE FUNDS AT THE BOTTOM EXCUSE ME THE FUNDS THAT WILL ACTUALLY BE IN A PERMITS SOURCE COMING IN EVERY YEAR. YEAR AFTER YEAR. WITH SEVENTY PERCENT ACTUALLY BEING LOCALLY ADMINISTERED PURPOSES OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THOSE FUNDS WILL BE DIVIDED BETWEEN. LARGER MIDSIZE JURISDICTIONS THAT RECEIVE THEIR FUNDS DIRECTLY. AS WELL AS A WE CALL NON ENTITLEMENT JURISDICTION GROUP THAT WILL BE. I MINISTER COMPETITIVELY AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT ALL CALIFORNIA JURISDICTIONS WILL BE RECEIVING AT LEAST. AT SOME FUNDING. THURMOND THIRTY PERCENT OF THE FUNDS IN THE OUT YEARS. THAT WILL BE STATE ADMINISTERED WITH A FIFTEEN PERCENT ADMINISTERED BY KELLY JEFF A WHICH TO YOU WILL TALK ABOUT FIVE PERCENT PRODUCTIONS HAD TO PROGRAMS AT TEN PERCENT. FOR FARMWORKERS HOUSING. THE PROVIDED HERE JUST A LITTLE A SKETCH OF. HOW THESE FUNDS WILL ACTUALLY ROLLOUT AT THIS POINT THIS IS OUR BEST GUESS PROJECTION? AS THOSE FEES COME IN. WE ARE LOOKING TO DEVELOP SOME OF OUR INITIAL GUIDELINES FOR COMMENT LATER THIS SUMMER. WE'RE LOOKING AT. HOPEFULLY PUTTING OUT OUR FIRST KNOWS FUNDING AVAILABILITY FOR THE INITIAL CHUNK OF FUNDING ON THE HOMES OF SYRIA. BY THE FALL AT SOME TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN THE PHOTOGRAPHS I LATER THIS YEAR PLANNING GRANTS THEMSELVES BEING MADE AVAILABLE INITIALLY IN SPRING TWENTY NINETEEN. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WERE STILL BURNING HUTCH IN THE MIX HERE IN TERMS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. PACIFIC'S OF HOW WE CAN MAKE THESE FUNDS AVAILABLE IN A WAY THAT IS. OUR EFFECTIVE EFFICIENT BUT DELIVERING ON THE POLICY GOAL TO THAT AND WE'VE BEEN BUSY. ARE TALKING TO STAKEHOLDER SOLICIT FEEDBACK AND INPUT ON USES AND HOW THE FUND SHOULD BE DISTRIBUTED. AND ATTEND TO CONTINUE TO DO BROUGHT OUT REACH. TO. A VARIETY OF STAKEHOLDERS. IN AUGUSTA HOMELESSNESS DOLLARS I DO WANT TO JUST SAY WE ARE VERY FOCUSED ON MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY TO SUPPORT LOCAL PRIORITIES INVESTMENTS. CREATING PERMITS SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PROVIDING RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND HOUSING SUBSIDIES. A PAPER SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND APPROVING THE PERFORMANCE AND LEVERAGING THE EXISTING HORSES PROGRAMS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE US TOOLS IN OUR QUIVER OURS AN ACQUITTAL. A CHECHEN REBELS MENTIONED SEVERAL THREE THE BETTER THAN AFFORDABLE HOUSING BOND ACT. SUBJECT VOTER APPROVAL OF THIS BOND ACT WILL PROVIDE A ONE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS FOR MULTI FAMILY HOUSING FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FOR TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT AND INFILL INFRASTRUCTURE. FOR REFER TO MILLION FOR CAL HOME. AND BEGIN THREE OTHER MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE STERN A FARM WORKER HOUSING PROGRAM. THREE MILLION TO LOCAL HOUSING TRUST FUND MATCHING GRANT. THESE ARE UP BUT THESE ARE TRIED AND TRUE OVER COURSE PROGRAMS WHICH HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN FUNDED THROUGH PASS BOND MEASURES BUT FOR WHICH THE FUNDS HAVE BEEN EXPANDED AND US S. B. THREE OFFERS US A CHANCE TO REFILL THOSE COFFERS. IN ADDITION TO THIS WORK ON HOUSING PACKAGE OF COURSE THE CITY IS ALSO VERY BUSY WITH A NUMBER OF THE THINGS THAT. WE'VE BEEN DOUBLING DOWN ON WHAT'S WORKING ALREADY WITH OUR EXISTING PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM FUNDED THROUGH CAPITA TRADE. IMPROVING OUR ADMINISTRATION OF FEDERAL FUNDS SUCH AS THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM. AND OF COURSE DOING THINGS LIKE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. TO PROVIDE A SUPPORT. THROUGH TO THOSE AREAS IMPACT BY DISASTERS AND TO ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAMS THAT WE OFFER. ARE SUPPORTIVE OF REALITIES THAT DISASTER SURVIVORS IN COMMUNITIES. BASS. THANK YOU FOR READING HERE TODAY. FACILITIES LEAVE YOU WITH A FEW WAYS THAT I'M HOPING. YOU CAN FOLLOW OUR PROGRESS AS WE WORK TO IMPLEMENT THESE THIS PACKAGE AND OTHER ACTIVITIES IN BILLS. FIRST ALL WE DO HAVE A HOUSING PACKAGE PAGE OF OUR WEBSITE. WE HAVE. JOINT TEN THOUSAND OTHER SUBSCRIBERS ON OUR EMAIL LIST SERVE A FOLLOW US ON TWITTER FACEBOOK. A PLEASE LET YOUR CONSTITUENTS KNOW THAT WE ARE EAGER TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AS THEY COME IN AND LOOKING FORWARD AS I SAID TO DOING THIS. INEQUALITY WAY. WITH. APPROPRIATE. SPEED. I AM A FORGER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. THANK YOU MISTER DIRECTOR I DON'T THINK AT THIS POINT ANOTHER PUBLIC COUPLE QUESTIONS THAT RECTOR THAT ONE WE TAKE THEM NOW BEFORE WE GO ON. TO THE NEXT PRESENTATION. CENTER BILL DO YOU WANNA START. OKAY JUST GO. TERMS OF THE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION OUT REACH FOR THE. SP THREE. CAN YOU GIVE US A MORE DETAILED IDEA ABOUT. HOW YOU GOING TO DO THAT IT'S GOING TO BE? THROUGHOUT THE STATE OR. HOW YOU HOW YOU PLAN ON GOING TO? THAT ISSUE. YEP SO WE ALTHOUGH THESE ARE. WORKFORCE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE INVESTED IN THE PAST WE ARE LOOKING AT THESE AGAIN WITH FRESH EYES AND. HAVE ALREADY BEGUN THE PROCESS OF ENGAGING MANY OF OUR STAKEHOLDER ASSOCIATIONS TO TO TO ASK THEM TO. PROVIDE TO BEGIN WORKING WITH THEIR MEMBERS TO BEGIN PROVIDING IMPORTANT BOUGHT TWO WAYS WE CAN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE. ONCE WE. HAVE THE A VOTER INITIATIVE. IN HAND AND IT HAS BEEN PASSED THAT WE WILL. AS WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST VIEW LOOKING TO PUT OUT IN DRAFT FORM. UPDATES TO OUR GUIDELINES FOR PUBLIC COMMENT YOU'LL HOLD REGIONAL FORUMS WEBINARS. WILL BUT THAT WILL HAPPEN LATER IN THE FALL AND EARLY IN THE WINTER. OKAY ON SP TO. LOOK LIKE YOUR. THE MONEY WILL BE. HOW WOULD YOU SAY UP FOR GRABS PRETTY QUICK? OF IN TERMS OF SOLICITATION ESPECIALLY FOR THE. DESPERATE HOMELESS. ISSUE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO. COPE WITH YOUR. OF. HOW SOON CAN WE GET THAT? THE SENATE TO OF FUNDING. AVAILABLE AND OUT THE DOOR. SO YOU SUBJECT TO A PUBLIC AND ASIA PROCESS WHICH WILL BE. PICKING UP IN THE LATE SPRING AND SUMMER OUR PLAN IS TO PUT THE FIRST CHUNK OF MONEY OUT IN THIS FALL. THROUGH NOTICE OF FUNDING AVAILABILITY EX THAT WOULD GO OFF THE FIRST TWO QUARTERS OF FUNDS COLLECTED. AND I SUCH WINDOWS OF FUNDING AVAILABILITY WITH THE FINAL TWO QUARTERS OF COUNTY HERE THAT WILL BE RELEASED IN THE SUMMERTIME ESTAMOS SUMMERS WHEN HOUSING. STATEMENT GENERAL ESTIMATE ARE YOU KNOW OUR OUR ENTIRE DETAIL YEAH OR WE WE REALLY WON'T KNOW UNTIL MAY ONE. WHEN OUR FIRST QUARTER REVENUES ARE COLLECTED. THE NUMBER THAT WE HAVE BEEN BUDGETING HAS BEEN TO IN A FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE COURSE THE COUNTER HERE BUT. THAT NUMBER IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS WHICH YOU HAVE HEARD PUBLIC IN AND DO A WIN. JANUARY ONE JANUARY ONE. SIERRA MISTER GLORIA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU A CHECK TO MAKE HAVE BEEN HERE FOR THE PRESENTATION OF KIND OF PICKING UP WORST CENTER BELL WAS JUST A MOMENT AGO. YOU RECOGNIZE THE URGENCY OF THE SITUATION IN CALIFORNIA OF IRA BY. RESPECTS AT THE SENATOR TALKED ABOUT GETTING THIS OUT FAIRLY QUICKLY I'M NOTICING THAT IT COULD BE A YOU MORE THAN A YEAR BEFORE SOME THE PLANNING GRANTS ARE OUT THE DOOR. A CITY WITH IN THIS COUNTY OR FOR THE HOMELESS GRANTS. I MONEY IS THERE ANYWAY TO SORT OF SPEED UP THAT PROCESS I THINK PARTICULARLY WHEN DEALING WITH A NEW FEE OF WITH CHAU SOME FAITH TO THE FOLKS PAIN THAT THAT WERE ACTING URGENTLY I GET FROM THE GENERAL PRESENTATION THAT YOU ARE. BUT IS THERE ANYWAY TO SPEED UP THE ALLOCATIONS PARTICULAR WHEN IT COMES TO THE HOMELESS GIVEN THE DIRE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT WERE IN. UP UP UP SO ON THE WHOLE ON THE HOMELESS IS RUNNING A PARTICULAR IT IS THE QUESTION YET START THERE YEAH A PLAYGROUND. YOU KNOW THE DARK CHALLENGE I THINK IS THAT WE DO NEED TO FIGURE OUT. SO I ASK YOU TO PROVIDE US WITH BROAD FLEXIBILITY ON ON HOW WE MIGHT USE THOSE FUNDS THERE ARE A VARIETY OF WAYS THE STATE HISTORICALLY SUPPORTED. POLICIES ACTIVITIES. THAT RANGE FROM. ARMOR SOLUTIONS GRANT EFFORTS TO BUILDING PERMITS FOR HOUSING TO RAPIDLY HOUSING WE DO NEED TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF WORK WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE USING THOSE MONIES IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY THAT DELIVERS. WHAT LOCALS WANT ON AND I THINK IN THE SAME SENSE OF TRYING TO ACCELERATE THE TIMING THERE THE DECISION THAT WE HAVE MADE AT THIS POINT? IS TO. GET STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK ON PUTTING OUT A FIRST. SLUGGER OF THE FUNDING ONCE WE HAVE THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR OF REVENUES COLLECTED BUT WE WON'T EVEN HAVE THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR COLLECTED UNTIL. LATE JULY OUT TO BE ABLE TO CALCULATE HOW MUCH WE HAVE WHICH WILL INFORM HOW DIFFERENT VESTMENTS MEADOW MAKE WHAT THE GRANT SIZES MIGHT BE. AND WILL NEED TO HAVE A SPACE TO GET PUBLIC COMMENT ON THAT'S I THINK CAN'T DO IT FASTER THAN THAT THE FIRST OF MANY FAST AND FALL. WITHOUT. SHORT CIRCUITING THE QUALITY PLANE YEAH SHE'S A LOOK AT THIS THE NO IT'S NO FUN FALL RIGHT SO THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY AWARDING GRANTS THROUGH. I I GUESS OF A PART OF BESIDES THE OBVIOUS URGENCY. TERMS WHAT YOU SEPARATING WALKING HERE TO OF TO MAKE THIS PRESENTATION. IS. IT IS NOTHING NEW UNDER THE SUN WHERE THIS STUFF IS CONCERNED RIGHT WE KNOW IT'S HOUSING NAVIGATION WE KNOW IT'S PERMITS SUPPORTIVE HOUSING TRANSITIONAL HOUSING. WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS MONEY NEEDS TO BE USED FOR AND I ALWAYS IN PERIL OR. FRUSTRATED OCCASIONALLY IN PEOPLE COMING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT PERSPECTIVE TODAY THAT WE HAVE TO STUDY THIS ANYWAY WE WE KNOW WHAT THE INTERVENTIONS ARE WE HAVE BEEN FUNDING THE SAME THREE NONPROFITS IN SAN DIEGO FOR A MILLION YEARS TO DO THIS WHAT THE PROBABLY THE ONES GOING AT THESE MONIES. AND I REALIZE THERE'S A THERE'S THE CHALLENGE OF ACTUALLY RECEIVING THESE FUNDS IN BEING ABLE TO. WHATEVER AMOUNT OF THE GRANT THAT WE GET TO MAKE GOOD ON THAT AMOUNT BUT. IT WILL. I JUST I I I I UNDERSTAND ME TO USE THIS MONEY WISELY AND JUDICIOUSLY AT THE SAME TIME. I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY KEYS ACROSS CALIFORNIA DON'T HAVE MEASURES ON THE BALLOT THIS FALL. AND WE NEED TO SHOW THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS ALREADY BEING USED WELL SO THAT WE CAN MAKE THE ARGUMENT WHITE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE NECESSARY IF THAT MAKES. SO. LET ME JUST IN AND SAVE MY COLLEAGUE. US SO IS THE NECESSARY THEN WELL THE. WE DO HAVE A SPECIAL NEEDS HOUSING PROGRAM THAT IS BEING ADMINISTERED AT CALLIE TO FAYE IN CONJUNCTION WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THAT IS USING VOLUNTARY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE ACT FUNDS. THAT FROM THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS VOLUNTARILY WE HAVE FOURTEEN OVER FOURTEEN JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE PARTICIPATING THAT SO WE ARE FUNDING HOMELESS HOUSING FOR HOPE THAT FOR FOLKS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS OR THEIR FAMILIES NOW. AND THAT PROGRAM IS ALL INVOLUNTARY PROGRAM THAT WAS MEANT TO SERVE IS THE TRANSITION UNTIL THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME PROGRAM COMES UP AND IS RUNNING. IN ADDITION OF THAT VIA SOME OF OUR MULTI FAMILY HOUSING FINANCING THAT WE'RE FINANCING AND USING OVER THE COUNTER. THERE ARE PARTNERSHIPS RIGHT NOW THAT ARE OCCURRING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN WHICH THEY ARE MAKING SURE THAT A PORTION OF THOSE MULTI FAMILY DEVELOPMENT ARE AVAILABLE FOR HOMELESS. INDIVIDUALS SO WE JUST APPROVED A PROJECT LAST WEEK WITH THE CITY OF SAN JOSE AND WHICH WE CAME IN WITH OUR PERMANENT LOOK FIRST LING LANDING AND THE CITY OF SAN JOSE BROUGHT IN SOME OF THEIR. FUNDING FROM LOCAL JURISDICTION AND THEY'RE SETTING ASIDE TEN PERCENT OF THAT ENTIRE DEVELOPMENT FOR THE HOMELESS AND SO WE ARE DOING OUR SHARE TO COMPLEMENT ONE ANOTHER. SO THERE ARE PROGRAMS RIGHT NOW IN THE STATE THAT ARE UP AND RUNNING THAT ARE FOR FUNDING THOSE PROGRAMS WITH EXISTING PROGRAMS OF EXISTING RESOURCES WOULD HAVE AT THE NEW RESOURCES OF SP TO A POTENTIALLY SP THREE. THINK UNDERSTAND THAT I'M ASKING QUESTIONS THAT TOO BECAUSE I'M ANTICIPATING VOTER RATIFICATION OF THREE AND I'M HOPING THAT WE WHATEVER PROCESS IS IT GOING TO GET THESE DOLLARS AT THE DOOR THAT THAT FOR THE PROCESS FOR THREE. WILL BE EVEN QUICKER HOPEFULLY. JUST TO PROVIDE APPOINTED TO KNOW FOR FOR THE HOMELESS MONEY GOES OUT IN THE FALL TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHEN MIGHT THE DEPARTMENT MAKE AWARDS OF THOSE FUNNY. SIXTY NINETY DAY PERIOD FOR FOLKS TO BUT THE OTHER APPLICATIONS AND THEN. BUT IN THE NINETY DAY PERIOD TO DISLIKE TO MAKE THOSE WORDS. DEPENDING ON HOW BUT THERE'S FUNDS OUT WE MIGHT FEEL BETRAYED THAT DOWN A LITTLE BIT SO SPRING OF TWENTY NINETEEN GROW THE ACTUAL CRASH CASH ON HAND TO DO THE PROGRAM. ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO MOVE THAT ALONG AND I REALIZE THAT CONSTRICTIONS ON THAT BUT BOTTOM WHEN WE TOOK THIS VOTE IN THE FALL OF TWENTIES. SEVENTEEN RIGHT TO TO DO THIS I'D I GET THE SENSE YOU'RE MOVING QUICKLY BACK THINK WE HAVE TO SHOW THAT WE'RE WORKING AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE PARTICULAR BECAUSE WE NEED WE'RE GOING BACK TO VOTED FOR S. B. THREE. I THINK THAT MAYBE LEASE TO INITIATIVE TO MY DISTRICT WITH REGARD TO HOMES FUNDING. AND THAT'S THAT'S THE CONCERT THE LAST QUESTION IS CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR THE TIME IS THE PLANNING GRANT FOR NO FLAWS. THAT YOUR SCOPING OUT WHAT THAT COULD BE USED FOR CURRENTLY HAS WHEN WE VOTED ON THIS IT WAS SORT OF GENERAL PLAN UPDATING KIND OF THING. I RECOGNIZE AGAIN THE SENSE OF URGENCY BEHIND THIS YOU CAN UNDERSTAND IMPATIENT YOUNG MAN. BUT THE IF THE IF THE DEMOCRAT UPDATES CAN TAKE YEARS RIGHT IS THERE IS THERE ANY EMPHASIS BEING PLACED OUTSIDE WE'RE BUILDING A NEW THREE BILLION DOLLAR LIGHT RAIL LINE IN MY ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. YOU KNOW COULD BE A SPECIFIC PLAN FOR FOR COMMUNITIES AROUND THAT OR IS THERE A WAY THE CITY'S TRYING TO FOUR MINUTES SO THE STATE IS TRYING TO FORCE COMMUNITIES. TO REALLY LOOK AT WHERE THE PLANNING MIGHT ACTUALLY GIVE US THE MOST YIELD OF OUR HOUSING CRISIS. USB TWO IS CLEAR THAT THESE ARE THESE ARE PLANNING GRANTS TO ACTUALLY ACCELERATE THE SUPPLY OF HOUSING AND RECIPIES THESE FUNDS WILL NEED TO BE ABLE TO SHOW THAT THESE ARTISTS ARE TAKING OR PLAN OFF THE SHELF AND. UPDATING FOR THE SAKE OF UPDATING BUT THESE ARE ACTUALLY INTERVENTIONS THAT SHOULD LEAD TO INCREASED SUPPLY. YEAH AND I THINK OF AS ONE AS WE ARE GOOD PUTTING OUT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT THE BILL DOES PROVIDE FOR STATE BECAUSE THIS IS RESOURCES. WE ARE PRIORITIZING DOES AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO WE CAN ACCESS OR TO GET OUT AND WORK WITH CITIES AND COUNTIES TO HELP THEM. UP MAKE SURE THE APPLICATIONS THAT BRING THE OF PLANNING GRANTS ARE THE BEST INTERVENTIONS THEY CAN. BUT IT WILL ALSO GET A LOT OF SUPPORT FROM MANY OF THE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT REPRESENT CITIES AND COUNTIES WHO REALLY WANT TO MAKE PEACE. FUNDS WORK WHILE THE STATUTE IS FLEXIBLE AND IT ALLOWS THEM TO DO THINGS LIKE USE THESE DOLLARS TO. FUND A PROGRAM NOT JUST OF ZONE TO IMPROVE PROCESS EASIER PERHAPS WITHIN THE BUILDING DEPARTMENT THEIR NUMBER OF THINGS THAT FOLKS CAN YOU THAT WILL DO THAT WILL REALLY MOVE THE NEEDLE WITH THESE FUNDS. OKAY. I AM AGAIN CAN YOU LEAVE ME TODAY WITH THAT THAT WE REALLY YOUR HOPEFULLY YOU KNOW THE SENSE THAT SAN DIEGO WHAT'S FAST URGENCY ON IT LET'S GO. ON THE RED STOOD ON HIGH RIGHT PEOPLE ARE HURTING AND WE NEED TO SEVEN DOWN. SOPPY SHE UNDERSTANDING THAT AND ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO HELP YOU THAT HAPPENED A WEEK HERE THANK YOU THINK. THANK WAS GLORIA AYE I WAS GOING TO SAVE A NUMBER MY QUESTIONS THAT YET BUT I WANT TO JUST ASK ONE FOLLOW UP TO WHAT. MISTER GLORY JUST ASKED AROUND HOMELESSNESS. OF IT I THINK FOR MANY OF US LAST YEAR'S PACKAGE WAS REALLY FOCUSED ON HOW WE. MOVE FORWARD BUILDING HOUSING UP FOR WHAT HOUSING AROUND THE STATE BUT THE FOCUS WAS A LITTLE BIT LESS ON HOMELESSNESS. WHICH IS A CRISIS THAT HAS CERTAINLY. SKYROCKETED IN AND IN RECENT YEARS OF AND OF ICE I CERTAINLY KNOW THAT YOU WILL BE DEVOTING A PORTION OF SP TWO AND PORTION OF SP THREE FUNDS. TO HOMELESSNESS ARM MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOUR DEPARTMENT IS BEEN REALLY LOOKING AT THE ESG PROGRAM THE EMERGENCY SHELTER GRANTS PROGRAM. AROUND RAPIDLY HOUSING AND I THINK MANY OF US HAVE APPRECIATED THAT. PROGRAM A BUT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT A CHRONICALLY HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS THE FORTY TWO PERCENT OF ALL AMERICANS WHO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN HOMELESS FOR NUMBER OF YEARS. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW MUCH OF THE THESE FUNDS WILL BE GOING TO ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF TRULY CHRONICALLY HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AS OPPOSED TO FOLKS WHO? ARE HAPPY BECOME MORE RECENTLY HOMELESS. WHAT ONE OF OUR PRIORITIES DEFINITELY IT'S OF SUPPORTING LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND WE IN THE CONTINUUM OF CARE IN TERMS OF BUILDING OUT WHAT'S CALLED COORDINATED ENTRY SYSTEM? THAT ACTUALLY ALLOWS THE JURISDICTIONS TO PRIORITIZE FOR ANY HOUSING OPPORTUNITY THOMAS INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE AND MOST CHRONIC AND SO I THINK THAT THAT ARE A HOMELESS DOLLARS ARE GOING OUT. THROUGH. TO SUPPORT THINGS LIKE PERMITS SUPPORTIVE HOUSNG. OUR EXPECTATION IS THAT JURISDICTION'S WOULD BE TARGETING THOSE UNITS FOR THE FOLKS ARE MOST PLEASURABLE TO EXIT THAT WE'RE PUTTING MONEY OUT SUPPORT WITH RAPIDLY HOUSING OR. RENTAL ASSISTANCE WILL BE WORKING THIS JURISDICTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BENEFICIARIES ARE THE ONES WITH THE MOST VULNERABLE. OKAY. GREAT THANK YOU WANNA CALL ANSWER WIENER THEN. MR STEINER'S. I'VE THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MISTER CHAIRMAN. I WON. FOR CIVIL RIGHTS IS REALLY COMPLEMENT YEAH ITS CITY FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF. OUR S. B. THIRTY FIVE OR WORKED REALLY HARD TO. OUGHT TO PASS IT AND. AND. YOU GUYS WERE JUST ON IT SO QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY. AND. REALLY GOT THE STREAMLINING LIST AL. I JUST WITHIN A MATTER OF. I MEAN WHAT A MONTH MAYBE. AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE SO I JUST ONE REALLY APPRECIATE INCOME BUT YOU AND YOUR STAFF. OF FOR JUST BEING SO PASSIONATE AND DEDICATED TO GETTING IT DONE. I HAVE I HAVE A GREAT TEAM YOU DO HAVE AN AMAZING TEAM RIGHT AFTER THAT. AND. AND THAT STREAMING LIST WAS IT WAS SO INFORMATIVE ARE TOO MANY OF US INTO THE PUBLIC. AND ON AYE OPENING AND SOME WAYS. OF. I WAS A DEPRESSING BECAUSE I'M AN OPTIMIST BY NATURE BUT AND I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE IN A MUCH BETTER DIRECTION BUT. IT WAS SUPER ANTHONY BUT THAT'S A BETTER WORD WITH SILVERY. OTHER FACT THAT ARE AS YOU MENTIONED ABOUT NINETY SEVEN PERCENT. OF. OF. JURISDICTIONS IN CALIFORNIA ARE NOT MEETING THEIR BELOW MARKET. RATES SO BASICALLY ALMOST EVERYONE. AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE. IT'S BECAUSE I. IT GENERALLY. FOR EXAMPLE NOT TO PICK ON BEVERLY HILLS BUT THAT WAS ONE THAT CAME OUT MANAGE TO NEGOTIATE ARENA OF THREE UNITS FOR AN EIGHT YEAR PERIOD. AT AND. SO THAT THAT'S REALLY AND SAN FRANCISCO DID NOT MEET ITS BLOOM MARKETS THIS IS A STATEWIDE ISSUE THE COMMUNITIES ARE NOT MEAN THEY'RE BELOW MARKET RATE. AND FOR THE COMMUNITIES THAT GOT. TRUE REAL NON LAUGHABLE RINA ALLOCATIONS FOR BELOW MARKET RATE YOU KNOW WE NEED HELP AND SO. WHEN AUTUMN I DO WE NEED REDEVELOPMENT DOCTOR STATES TO DO MORE IN TERMS OF HELPING WITH FUNDING. ON BUT THE OTHER PIECE OF IT WHICH YOU MENTIONED. ARE BECAUSE WE'RE ALL GOING TO WORK REAL HARD TO MAKE SURE WE'RE GIVING COMMUNITIES TOOLS TO BUILD. AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE. IS THE. OF WILL MARKET RATE PORTION OF IT BECAUSE OUR FOR OUR MIDDLE CLASS AYE WE'RE NEVER GONNA YOU MIGHT YOU SUBSIDIZE OUR WAY. OUT OF A PROBLEM AND OUR HOUSING SUBSIDIES I AM IN MY VIEW NEED TO BE REALLY FOCUSED ON ALL INCOME PEOPLE. ARTICLES A MARKET WILL NOT PRODUCE HOUSING IN MANY AREAS AFFORDABLE. TO LOW INCOME PEOPLE ODD BUT FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS WE JUST NEED MORE HOUSING AND. I WE HAVE A DEFICIT APPROACHING FOUR MILLION. UNITS AND IT GOES UP BY ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND. OPERA YEAR SO IT SYSTEM AMASSING GAPING DEFICIT. I AND. WHAT ARE THE STREAMLINING LIST THAT A CD PUT OUT SHOWS IS THAT OVER TWO THIRDS OF JURISDICTIONS ARE NOT MEETING? I EVEN THEIR MARKET RATE GOALS OUR AND OUR. AND IT SHOWED ALSO. MORE I THINK A LOT OF US KNEW THAT RINA IS BROKEN DOWN DIETERS SO POLITICIZED THAT WE HAVE. CITIES ARE ADJACENT TO EACH OTHER IN VERY SIMILAR WITH DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT READ THE NUMBERS YOU'VE WEALTHIER COMMUNITIES BEING ABLE TO NEGOTIATE ALLEN. OF WITH THEIR COLLEAGUES ARE LOWER NOT RENEW NUMBERS. AND SO I THINK OF WHAT THE STREAMLINING LIST SHOW IT TO TWO THINGS IT. IT STARTED INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT PROCESS AND I THINK WE'RE ALREADY SEEING SOME ATMOSPHERIC CHANGES AND SOME CITIES AROUND THE STATE IN TERMS OF ATTITUDE TOWARDS APPROVING HOUSING. A BUT IT ALSO SHOWED THE WORK THAT REMAINS. AROUND JUST GETTING MORE HOUSING PRODUCED PERIOD AND MAKING SURE THAT. ARENA ALLOCATIONS ARE FAIR AND EQUITABLE ON SO THANK YOU FOR. HELP HELPING TAKE A CRITICAL FIRST STEP. TO OUR VICE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE MISTER STEINORTH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATED MISTER CHAIR MISTER CHAIR. SO THE RECENTLY RELEASED TRAILER BILL BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. OUTLINES OF FUNDING FORMULA TO TAKE IN CONSIDERATION. THAT IS NOT IN MY OPINION TAKING CONSIDERATION HISTORIC INVESTMENTS MADE BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SO WE'RE BACK TO TOPIC HOMELESSNESS. I BY REPRESENTS THE MEDINA COUNTY AN AND THE ADJACENT COUNTY RIVERSIDE COUNTY BOTH COUNTIES BEEN WORKING VERY DILIGENTLY OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS. WITH LOCAL FUNDS TO REALLY TRY AND REDUCE THE HOMELESSNESS POPULATION SO WE LOOK AT A POINT TIME COUNTY YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE BELOW WHAT WE'RE LOOKING OUT OF THAT FOUR THOUSAND HOMELESS BECAUSE IT WORKED SO DILIGENTLY. OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS SO MY CONCERN IS WHEN THE FORMULA WAS OUTLINED IN THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL AND WAS DEVELOPED. BLESSED THE CONSIDERATION OF LOCAL PROGRESS IN HISTORIC INVESTMENTS ON THE LOCAL LEVEL TAKING A FEDERATION. CSUS SO BUT THE. SP TWO VERY CLEARLY ASKS THAT WE HAVE GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY IN TERMS THE DISTRIBUTIONS THAT WE MAKE. OF WHAT THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ASPIRES TO DO IS JUST CREATE A FULL OR. OF THE MINIMUM ELIGIBLE THAT APPLICANTS FOR PROJECTS PROGRAMS CAN'T COMPETE FOR THESE OTHER THEY HAVE ELIGIBLE PROJECTS IT DOESN'T. A NICE A STATE OR BECAUSE DIRECT ALLOCATION. SO I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE EXACTLY THE THINGS THAT BE BUILT INTO ANY PARTICULAR FUNDING A NOTICE OF FUNDING UNAVAILABILITY. IN TERMS OF PRIORITIZING PRIVILEGE FOLKS WHO HAVE TRACK RECORD CAPACITY EXPERTISE AND IT CAN PROVE THEY CAN DELIVER. SO I THINK WE CAN GET. BUT WE CAN GET THERE WHILE THE SAME TIME PROVIDING FOR THE GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY. JACK BECAUSE I MEAN OF COURSE WE'RE ALL APPEAR TRYING TO IDENTIFY AND I UNDERSTAND EXACTLY HOW THIS WILL MAKE A DIRECT IMPACT IN THE DISTRICTS THAT WE REPRESENT. AND IN THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT THEY'VE THEY'VE BEEN REALLY GOOD ACTORS AND THEY'VE DONE A VERY GOOD JOB AND TRYING TO REDUCE THEIR HOMELESSNESS POPULATION COUNTY THEY'VE DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB IN REDUCING BY SEVENTY PERCENT. SINCE I AM I THINK WAS TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT TO TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT. I'M VARIATION SO WHEN THEY LOOK AT AND THEY SAY OKAY FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE WERE HAVING THE DISCUSSIONS OF SP TWO. YOU KNOW FOR THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF FOR FOR A PERIOD OF TIME ALMOST THREE YEARS I GUESS. MY SET SERVICE IN MEDINA COUNTY EXPLAINED TO ME THAT YOU WERE GOING TO BECOME A DONOR COUNTY. WHERE THE AMOUNT OF DOLLARS THAT WILL BE YOU KNOW FOR S. B. TWO WILL BE REMOVED FROM OUR COUNTY WILL NOT BE COMING BACK TO US BECAUSE WE'VE ACTUALLY DONE A REASONABLE JOB AND TRYING TO? YOU KNOW DEAL WITH OUR HOMELESSNESS CALVET CONSIDERATIONS THERE SO MIKE MY QUESTION FOLLOW UP THIS. I WOULDN'T WOULD YOU CONSIDER FUTURE AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD ADDRESS INVESTMENTS MADE LOCALLY SO THAT OUR REGION DOES NOT SEE ITSELF AS BEING JUST A COMPLETELY DONOR REGION. SO YEAH I THINK AS I SAID EARLIER I THINK THOSE ARE THE ISSUES THAT WILL SURFACE AS WE DO GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT AND NOTICES A FUNDING AVAILABILITY IN THE PAST WE HAVE. PRIVILEGED FOLKS WHO COME IN WITH CAPACITY IN TRACK RECORDS OF BEING ABLE TO DELIVER SO I THINK WE CAN WORK THAT OUT TO THE MINISTER PROCESSES. VERY GOOD THANK YOU. GREAT UNLESS YOU'RE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME FOR MISTER METCALF WHY DON'T WE. WHAT WE HAVE MOVED TO HEARING FROM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF? CAL EACH OF A. THIS BUILDING PATTERSON. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAIR. AND CHAIR. AND SENATOR BELT FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY I AM TOO BUT THE PATTERSON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY. AS YOU KNOW COUCH FACE SERVES AS THE STATE'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING BANKING WAS CREATED TO DEVELOP PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN STATE GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE CAPITAL INVESTORS. TO CREATE ADDITIONAL HOW AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES SINCE ITS CREATION CALCULATORS OPERATED PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT THE CREATION OF AFFORDABLE MULTI FAMILY AND SINGLE FAMILY HOUSING. DOWN PAYMENT AND CLOSING COSTS ASSISTANCE FOR FIRST TIME HOMEBUYERS SPECIAL PROGRAMS IN CONCERT WITH CITIES AND COUNTIES SPECIAL NEED HOUSING FOR. MENTALLY ILL INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND HOUSING FOR VETERANS THIS SCOPE IN APPROACHING CONTINUUM OF HOUSING HAS HAD IS ADDRESSED IN SOME OF COLLEGES MISSION TO CREATE AND FINANCE PROGRESSIVE HOUSING SOLUTIONS SO MORE CALIFORNIANS HAVE A PLACE TO CALL HOME. AS YOU HEARD FROM A MISTER METCALF THE DIRECTOR BATES CD OUR SISTER DEPARTMENT THE MAJORITY OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN HOUSING PACKAGE WILL BE IMPLEMENTED BY HDTV OTHER HOUSING POLICIES AND PROGRAMS. CALVET YOU FACE ROLE IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE HOUSING LEGISLATION COMES IN THE FORM OF FUNDING FROM TWO BILLS SENATE BILL TWO BY SENATOR ATKINS. AND IF APPROVED BY THE VOTERS IN NOVEMBER SENATE. SENATE BILL THREE BY SENATOR BELL. KELLY TO BE PROMOTES AFFORDABLE HOUSING BY OFFERING FINANCIAL PRODUCTS THAT THE MARKET EITHER DOES NOT PROVIDE OR PROVIDES AT A HIGHER COST TO BORROWERS. COUNTY BE OFFERS LOW COST DEBT FINANCING FUNDED BY PRIVATE CAPITAL MARKETS SIMILAR TO BANKS WAYS EACH CD PROVIDES FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT FUNDING SUBSIDIES TO MAKE PROJECTS MORE FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE. THOUGH OUR APPROACHES TO MEETING OUR MISSION ARE DIFFERENT CALIPHATE AND EIGHT CD COMPLEMENT ONE ANOTHER AND HAVE ACHIEVED SOME OF THE MOST POSITIVE HOUSING COMPANY CAO OUT COMES WHEN THE TWO ORGANIZATIONS HAVE WORKED IN CLOSE COLLABORATION. TO SERVE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS INDUSTRY PARTNERS AND OUR CUSTOMERS. CALIPHATE SELF SUPPORTED AND DOES NOT RELY ON THE STATE'S GENERAL FUND TO ADMINISTER ITS LOAN PROGRAMS. THE US COUCH OF A INTENDS TO USE THE FUNDING FROM S. B. TUTU AND POTENTIALLY THE FUNDS FROM S. B. THREE TO EXPAND ALREADY SUCCESSFUL LOAN PROGRAMS. SINCE THE FRAMEWORK IS ALREADY IN PLACE CALLIE TO FAYE IS READY NOW TO IMPLEMENT ITS PIECE OF THE HOUSING PACKAGE. S. B. THREE THE FOUR BILLION DOLLAR VETERANS IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING BOND OF. TWENTY EIGHTEEN WILL GO IN FRONT OF THE VOTERS IN NOVEMBER AND SHOULD IT PASS A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO COUCH IF A FOR USED FOR HOMEBUYER ASSISTANCE. THE FUNDS WILL GO DIRECTLY INTO OUR EXISTING MY HOME PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES DOWN PAYMENT AND CLOSING COSTS ASSISTANCE. FROM ITS INCEPTION IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THROUGH THE END OF THE LAST FISCAL YEAR ABOUT TWO AND A HALF YEARS MY HOME HAS PROVIDED ASSISTANCE TO MORE THAN NINE THOUSAND LOW TO MODERATE INCOME CALIFORNIA FIRST TIME HOMEBUYERS. WE ESTIMATE THAT UP ADDITIONAL HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION WE CAN PROVIDE DOWN PAYMENT AND CLOSING COSTS ASSISTANCE FOR AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIA FIRST TIME HOMEBUYERS. OVER THE NEXT THREE TO SIX YEARS DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS. ONE OF THE INITIATIVES I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT MYSELF SENATOR WHAT CASKEY WALKIN IS. YOU HAD STE LEGISLATION THAT MADE IT EASIER TO BUILD SELF THREE DWELLING UNITS. AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THROUGH OUR PARTNERS IN CDF BUYS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES OF HOW CAN WE PROVIDE LOW COST SPENDING SO THAT WE CAN GET LENDING OR FINANCING AVAILABLE. TO THOSE COMMUNITIES TO HELP IN THE FINANCING OF ASSESS REDRAWING UNITS AND WE'VE IDENTIFIED TO USE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ONE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND ONE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IN SAN JOSE AREA. IN WHICH WE PUT PLAN TO PARTNER WITH THEM ONE BY FINANCING PRODUCT PROCESS WE TELLING UNITS I WANT TO JUST PUT THAT PLUG IN THERE FOR THE SENATOR. SO ON OUR MULTI FAMILY SIDE FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN THROUGH FISCAL YEAR TWENTY FOURTEEN FIFTEEN THROUGH THE END OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE HAVE PROVIDED ABOUT ONE BILLION AND FINANCING FOR A HUNDRED MULTI FAMILY RENTAL DEVELOPMENTS TO OUR FIRST THING LENDING. CONDUIT FINANCING OR-SUBORDINATE DEBT PROGRAMS. THESE PROJECTS HAVE CREATED TO PRESERVE SIX THOUSAND UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR LOWER INCOME FAMILIES INCLUDING SENIORS VETERANS AND THOSE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. JUST ABOUT HALF OF THESE UNITS WERE NEW CONSTRUCTION. SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN USING A LIMITED POOL OF INTERNAL RESOURCES TO FINANCE THE CREATION OF PRESERVATION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR CALIFORNIA'S. OF LOWER INCOME BRACKETS HOWEVER WE HAVE IN OUR PIPELINE PROJECTS ON OUR MULTI FAMILY SIDE THOSE THAT WILL BE REGULATED TO SERVE PEOPLE MAKING UP TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY PERCENT. OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME SO WE ARE SERVING LOW. AND LOWER END AND COME ALL THE WAY TO MODERATE INCOME AND I HEARD. SENATOR WIENER SAY THAT WE WEREN'T GOING TO SUBSIDIZE OUR WAY OUT OF MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING BUT I 牅 INCOME HOUSING. BECAUSE WHEN YOU DO HAVE MIXED INCOME MULTI FAMILY DEVELOPMENT YOU CAN CROSS SUBSIDIZE AND THOSE DEVELOPMENTS ARE OFTEN MORE SUSTAINABLE. SO BEGINNING IN TWENTY NINETEEN FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THE ESTIMATED THIRTY TO FORTY MILLION DOLLARS GENERATED BY S. B. TO WILL BE CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED TO COLLEGE BAY FOR THE PURPOSE OF CREATING. MIXED INCOME MULTI FAMILY RESIDENTIAL HOUSING FOR LOW TO MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. WE HAVE TAKEN NOTICE OF THE HOUSING CRISIS HAS HIT THOSE AT THE IN THE LOWEST INCOME BRACKETS THE HARDEST. BUT WE ALSO IT HAS ALSO HIT THE WRITTEN BURDEN LOW TO MODERATE INCOME FOLKS AND BOTH RULE COMMUNITIES AND HIGH COST COMMUNITIES. FOR THIS POPULATION OF RENTERS THERE GENERALLY IS NO EXISTING STATE RENTAL HOUSING PROGRAM. AND WE HAVE TERM THIS RENTAL POPULATION THE MISSING MIDDLE THOSE THAT INCOMES BETWEEN SIXTY PERCENT A MRI AND A HUNDRED TWENTY PERCENT I AM I AND JUST GIVE YOU A DOLLAR FIGURE. HERE IN SACRAMENTO THAT WOULD BE FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR MAKING BETWEEN FIFTY THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND. THE INFUSION OF SP TWO FUNDS INTO OUR EXISTING MULTIFAMILY LENDING PROGRAMS WILL ALLOW US TO EXPAND OUR MULTIFAMILY LENDING TO SERVE A BROADER RANGE OF INCOME LEVELS INCLUDING THE MISSING MIDDLE. NOT TO. TAKE AWAY FROM THOSE AT THE LOWER INCOME SO IT'S A BROADER RANGE NOT TAKING AWAY PURCHASE MAKING IT A BROADER RANGE OF INCOMES. THROUGH THAT THOUGH THE FUNDING WON'T BE AVAILABLE UNTIL TWENTY NINETEEN THE FRAMEWORK AND LENDING PROGRAMS TO PUT THESE FUNDS TO USE IS ALREADY IN PLACE. OUR EXISTING SMALL LOAN PROGRAM AND GAP FINANCING PROGRAM WILL BE EXPANDED TO FINANCE AND INCENTIVIZE MIXED INCOME MOLTI FAMILY DEVELOPMENTS AND SMALLER DEVELOPMENTS IN SOME OF OUR RULE COMMUNITIES. WITH THE SMALL LOAN PROGRAM WE PROVIDE LOANS TO SMALLER DEVELOPMENTS THAT OTHER LENDERS WON'T LEND TO. NOT ONLY WILL WE PROVIDE LOW COST FINANCING OF THREE POINT FIVE MILLION OR MORE DEPENDING ON THE AREA WE HAVE STREAMLINED THE LOAN PROCESS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR LESS EXPERIENCE DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. THE OTHER COLLEGE OF A PROGRAM THAT WE USE S. B. TO FUNDS TO EXPAND AND FINANCE MORE MIXED INCOME DEVELOPMENTS IS OUR GAP FINANCING PROGRAM. THIS SUBORDINATE DEBT FINANCING IS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR PERMANENT LOANS OR CONDUIT FINANCING IT IS A PROGRAM THAT COULD BE A LINE TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND LEVERAGE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SUBORDINATE DEBT. IN A WAY THAT STRETCHES LOCAL RESOURCES TO CREATE MORE HOUSING FOR LOW TO MODERATE INCOMES AND PERCENT. ASSEMBLYMAN GLORIA WE ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO WE'VE ALSO WORKED WITH THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO AND THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES TO CREATE PARTNERSHIPS IN WHICH WE CAN PULL OUR SUBORDINATE DEBT. WITH OUR FIRSTLY LOANS ARE CONDUIT ISSUE IS TO GET THAT LOW COST FINANCING DOWN TO THE DEVELOPERS TO BE ABLE TO CREATE AND EXPAND. OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK. BOTH OF THESE MULTIFAMILY LENDING PROGRAMS ARE OVER THE COUNTER. ARE ALREADY IN PLACE AND ARE ALREADY SUCCESSFUL INFUSION OF FUNDS FROM S. B. TWO WILL SIMPLY ALLOW US TO SERVE A BROADER RANGE OF CALIFORNIANS IN ME. AND ANTICIPATED THAT YOU WOULD ASK ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE DONE TO ENGAGE STAKEHOLDERS TO OUT TO TO TO TO TO UTILIZE THESE FUNDS WE HAVE BEEN PRO ACTIVELY ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS OVER THE LAST YEAR INCLUDING THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY AND OTHER MULTI FAMILY PARTNERS. SUCH AS LOCAL HOUSING AGENCIES AND STATE LAWMAKERS AN ATTEMPT TO GATHER INFORMATIONS ON CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC HOUSING NEEDS AND THE BEST WAY TO LEVERAGE THE ADDITIONAL. S. B. TO FINANCING I PERSONALLY MET WITH LAWMAKERS FROM AROUND THE STATE AND HAVE SPOKEN HOUSING DEVELOPERS LOCAL HOUSING AGENCY STAFF HOUSING ADVOCATES AT CONFERENCES AND OTHER GATHERINGS OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS. AND IT WAS THROUGH THESE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE DECIDED TO EXPAND THE SMALL LOAN AND GAP FINANCING PROGRAM AND THAT THIS WOULD BE THE BEST USE OF THIS PERMANENT FUNDING SOURCE. WE WILL USE THE TIME UNTIL THE S. B. TWO FUNDING COMES TO US INTO AND TWENTY NINETEEN TO CONTINUE OUR OUT REACH. TO THE DEVELOPERS AND LOCAL HOUSING AGENCIES GATHERING FOCUS GATHERING FOCUS GROUPS AND HOSTING WORKSHOPS WILL BE AN EFFICIENT WAY FOR CALIPHATE AND ITS PARTNERS TO COLLABORATE ON THE SMALLER DETAILS AND DRILL DOWN TO THE BEST WAYS. THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE MOST EFFICIENT USE OF THESE FUNDS WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ALL AND THROUGH YOUR COMMITTEE AND STAFF AND YOUR REPRESENTATIVES. AS PART WE PROGRESS AND UPDATE AND WE TO SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO EXCHANGE IDEAS I THINK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND I AM AVAILABLE SHOULD YOU HAVE ANY QUESTION. QUESTIONS COLLEAGUES. I'LL START WITH WITH ONE QUESTION YOU REFERENCE THAT THE MISSING MIDDLE. BY DEFINITION MARKET RATE HOUSING IS DEVELOPED WITH THE MARKET RATE RESOURCES AND A LOT OF THE LINE SURE OF OUR. HOUSING DOLLARS GO TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH IS REALLY MORE FOR LOWER INCOME CALIFORNIANS. AND YOU ALLUDED TO THE FACT THAT SOME OF YOUR DOLLARS GO TO HELPING THAT MISSING MIDDLE. SEGMENT OF BUT I THINK FOR MANY OF OUR PERSPECTIVES THERE'S NOT ENOUGH THAT IS IN THAT AREA TO REALLY JUICE PRODUCTION. OF MISSING MIDDLE HOUSING DO YOU HAVE ANY DIFFERENT THOUGHTS ABOUT OTHER THINGS AT OTHER POLICIES THAT WE COULD BE CONSIDERING IN THIS AREA. OTHER DIRECTIONS YOUR AGENCY MIGHT BE LOOKING AT TO. TO PROMOTE MISSING MIDDLE HOUSING PRODUCTION. WELL I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO SEE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SOME BY HOUSING PACKAGE IN SOME OF THE. BILLS AND THAT MISTER METCALF TALKED ABOUT I THINK THAT WILL GO A LONG WAY I THINK CONTINUED COLLABORATION WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT I THINK LOOKING AT SURPLUS PROPERTY I KNOW THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO WAS LOOKING AT AND I'M WORKING WITH THE CITY OF. SAN DIEGO AND THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO BOTH ON WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN YOU SURPLUS PROPERTY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL OR AT THE STATE LEVEL TO COMBINE THOSE RESOURCES AND BRING DOWN THAT COSTS. TO BE ABLE TO HELP WITH THE PRODUCTION OF MORE MIXED INCOME AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSING. GREAT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. SENATE BILL. BOB. COUPLE YEARS AGO WE PASSED. ALL. IF RISK THAT ENHANCE INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICTS WHICH CAN BE USED FOR. AFFORDABLE HOUSING IT'S. CREATING A ZONE YOU CREATED A. A FINANCING. STRUCTURE. AND OF FUND A PROGRAM USES STATE. DEPARTMENTS. INTERESTED AND. BLENDING THEIR FUNDS FOR THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS WITH THOSE KINDS OF LOCAL FUNDS THAT ARE CREATED. THROUGH INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICTS. HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES OWNS. SANTA CLARA COUNTY LA COUNTY WE HAVE THE BOND FUNDS. FOR. HOME BUYERS DISTANCE OF THOSE KINDS OF PROGRAMS. IS THAT IS THAT IS THAT. WHAT WHAT WHAT IS YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT THAT DECLARATION? FUNDING OF. SHE'S LEAVING NOW CENTER RIGHT CAL SKIS. FINANCING CENTER ACCOUNT CITIES. THEY LEGISLATION. JUST THAT WHILE YOU. IS THERE SO SOME OF THE SUBORDINATE DEBT FINANCING THAT I'VE SEEN COME IN FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE COME IN THE FORM OF RENTAL SUBSIDIES. CITY AND COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES HAVE PEOPLE SUBSIDIES ALL THE WAY UP TO BOND PROCEEDS AND SO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE COMING IN A VARIETY OF WAYS IN WHICH THEY'RE COLLABORATING WITH OUR FINANCING AND AND WERE SEEN THAT COME TOGETHER. SO I I I'M OPEN TO THAT WORKS YES IT IS IT'S ABSOLUTELY WORKING NIGHT WE HAVE A PROVIDED DEEPER SUBSIDY FOR. OF MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING OR WON'T WE JUST WE JUST DID APPROVE A PROJECT FOR IN THE CITY OF SAN JOSE. THAT IS GOING TO HAVE MIXED INCOME. AND A SET ASIDE SPECIFICALLY FOR HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AND SO WHAT THEY DID IS WHEN THEY CAME IN WITH THEIR SUBSIDY AND THEY ALSO HAD SOME OLD REDEVELOPMENT DOLLARS THAT WERE IN THE PROJECT. THAT THEY WANTED THAT THE PROJECT WANTED TO HAVE RE SUBORDINATE SUBORDINATED AND SO IN EXCHANGE FOR THEM RE SUBORDINATING THAT DEBT. THEY GOT TEN PERCENT OF THE UNITS SET ASIDE FOR HOMELESS AND SO THERE ARE VERY CREATIVE AND STRATEGIC WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN WORK WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND. HAVING COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND NOW BEING WITH THE STATE THAT I THINK THAT IS SO CRITICAL THAT WE WORK TOGETHER COLLABORATIVELY SO THAT WE CAN ALIGN OUR RESOURCES AND MAKE THOSE TYPE OF PROJECTS HAVE. YEAH I I. WHO WHEN I WAS A COUNCIL MEMBER RIGHT FOUNDED THE CITY'S HOUSING DEPARTMENTS? DID SAN JOSE SO SO WE. WE THINK THAT THAT KIND OF APPROACH WITH THE. LOCAL GOVERNMENT. ESPECIALLY. SIR ONCE WITH THE WHERE WITH. TOO BLAND AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE. FOR BOTH YOU IS. HOUSING TRUST OUT HOW I OF HOUSING TRUST. FUND PROGRAMS. IT HAD SOME OF THE STATE PROGRAMS THAT YOU HAVE IS THOSE ARE THOSE. UNITIES. ACTIVATED. AND THEY WILL BE ACTIVATED HOPEFULLY WITH SP THREE BUT. HOW HOW WOULD YOU USE A HOUSING TRUST YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON? HOUSING TRUST. BETTER THERE'D BEEN CREATED SO MANY COMMUNITIES. YES WE WE OFTEN WILL WORK WITH HOUSING TRUST FUNDS IN TERMS OF THE THE FINANCING THAT THEY PROVIDE. AND I WOULD SAY THERE IS A SPECTRUM OF CAPACITY EQUALITY AND CAPITALIZATION FOR HOUSING TRUST FUNDS. BUT NOT ALL OF THEM ARE EQUAL BY ANY MEANS WE HAVE A NUMBER OUT THERE THAT ARE ROUTINELY. A DEPLOYING THEIR CAPITAL RELIEF TO HELP ACQUIRE SITES THERE PROVIDING THE CRITICAL SERVE SUBSIDY GAP OF THE BRIDGES. WHAT A PROJECT IS GETTING FROM FEDERAL LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS PLUS THE STATE THEY GIVE THAT DELTA? THE MAKE SOME COMPETITIVE WHEN THEY COMMIT ARE PART OUR PROGRAM TO PROCESSES. TO MAKE EVEN MORE SO WITH THAT FEDERAL TAX CREDIT. HAVING LOST SOME OF ITS VALUE. AND I THINK TWO THINGS AS WE LOOK FORWARD THE REALLY IMPORTANT THING ABOUT ONE IS. OBVIOUSLY S. B. THREE DOES PROVIDE FUNDS FOR US TO INVESTIGATE AND IN DIRECTLY INTO CAPITALIZING THESE REGIONAL HOUSING TRUST FUND WILL BE HUGELY HELPFUL. I'M IN THE SECOND IS I THINK WITH SP TWO WE WILL ALSO NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME SEE. FUNDING GOING DIRECTLY INTO A LOT OF CITIES INCLUDING SOME THAT MAY NOT HAVE HOUSING APARTMENTS RIGHT THEY MAY NOT ACTUALLY HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN OPERATING A HOUSING PROGRAM. I THINK WE HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY BY THE COUNTY OR THE CAN BE RE ETHANOL BILL WE HAVE RARE OPPORTUNITY SORT HIM SUSE I I THINK IT'S A GREAT VALUE PROPOSITION FOR CITIES TO SORT OF SAY HEY WE'RE GONNA BE GETTING SOME S. B. TO MONEY FOR THE FIRST. TIME SORTING TWENTY EIGHT NINETEEN. BUT MAYBE DOES MAKE SENSE FOR US TO BUILD UP A DEPARTMENT AND STAFF OF THE PROGRAMMES NOT ENOUGH MONEY BUT IF WE CAN CONTRACT THAT SERVICE WITHOUT REASON HOUSING TRUST FUND IS ADMINISTERED BY THE COUNTY. PROVIDE NONPROFIT IT'S A WIN WIN WIN. THE OF THE. O. ORGANIZATIONS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. THAT. ARE WRONG DESPERATE FOR HOUSING THEY KEEP. CALLING OUR OFFICES WANTING HOUSING FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES ETCETERA. OF. A LOT OF THEM ARE. IT THIS TIME TRYING TO INVEST OR SUBSIDIZE THEIR EMPLOYEES. IN TERMS OF ARM. HOUSING. YOU KNOW THEY'RE GIVING THEIR EMPLOYEES STIPENDS AND VOUCHERS AND. THERE EVEN RENTING LARGE SECTIONS OF APARTMENT BUILDINGS. HOUSING THEIR EMPLOYEES. IN THAT WAY. IN ADDITION WE HEAR FROM THE SCHOOL SYSTEM THAT THEY WANT. TEACHER HOUSING AND AND OTHER KINDS OF THINGS. OUR OUR. ARE YOU OR YOUR AGENCIES. I D. IS ON HOW TO USE. NOT JUST THE OF FOCUSING ON S. B. WANTED TO BUT. OR OR TWO OR THREE BUT. ANY. FUNDS THAT WE COULD FIND. ARE YOU ARE YOU. ABLE TO USE THOSE FUNDS FOR THOSE KINDS OF PURPOSES AND COLLABORATION. WITH SAY A SCHOOL DISTRICT OR. PRIVATE EMPLOYER. TO HELP SUBSIDIZE. THE NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES. I THINK IN A BROADER APPLICATIONS AND WE'RE WE'RE CURRENTLY USING YEAH TECHNICAL ANSWERS THAT IT DEPENDS. BECAUSE WHILE WE CAN DEPLOY OUR FUNDS AND ALSO POTENTIALLY FEDERAL FUNDS THERE ARE SOME LIMITATIONS THAT COME WITH THOSE. AND SO YOU REALLY SPICK ICY SIDEWALK ON A COMMERCIAL ACTIONS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT ALWAYS WORK QUITE RIGHT FOR THE SALARIES AT A GIVEN EMPLOYEE OR TEACHER MY COMMUNITY. AND WE ALSO HAVE TO HAVE THE OBLIGATION OF THE FAIR HOUSING ACT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE HOPE THAT. LEASING PRACTICES ARE ARE NOT. ALRIGHT DISCRIMINATORY TERMS OF WHO ENDS UP GETTING THE HOUSING IS PROVIDED A STATE AND FEDERAL MONEY SO WE CAN MAKE IT WORK. BUT BUT IT DEPENDS ON FACT PATTERN IMPRINT THAT WE DO WE DO TAKE A POSITION TYPE TIME WE DON'T WORK HAVE WORKED ON A NUMBER SCHOOL SCHOOL ANY OTHER QUESTIONS TO THIS PANEL. PERSON I WANT TO SEE AGAIN THANK BOTH OF YOU FOR YOUR TREMENDOUS WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE MANY OF US TO. WHO UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A VERY INTENSE CRISIS THAT HOPEFULLY BY WORKING TOGETHER WILL BE ABLE TO? TO GET THROUGH AND I'LL LOOK FORWARD TO ALL THE IMPLEMENTATION WORK YOU WERE DOING THIS YEAR AND A PLEASE KEEP US POSTED ON. BOTH HOW THAT IS GOING AS WELL AS. WHAT WE CAN DO TO KEEP OUR COMMON AGENDA MOVING FORWARD AND I ALSO APPRECIATE? THE VERY PUBLIC OUTREACH THAT BOTH YOUR AGENCIES ARE ENGAGED IN WITH OUR KIDS. SO THAT'S MUCH APPRECIATED. THANK YOU. SO WITH THAT. YEAH OK UM. WILL. NEXT YEAR THE NEXT PANEL WHICH IS. WE'D LIKE TO WELCOME YOU COMING HOW SHE TO COME FORWARD. THIS IS LOCAL INNOVATIVE EFFORTS TO COMBAT HOMELESSNESS AND. S. PANEL WILL FOCUS ON STEPS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND OTHERS ARE TAKING TO TACKLE HOMELESSNESS AND. HOW UPDATED PLANNING DOCUMENTS AND OTHER THINGS CAN BE USED TO? SPEED UP OUR HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES SO WE HAVE. WE HAVE. ELAINE. THE CALL A OKAY ELAINE GOTCHA. SHE'S HERE LOU BROWN LOHR ARCHER LE. A LOOP BROWN'S MERCED COUNTY. RIGHT LOOK. MERCED GOOD. LARA ACTUALIZED JAMBOREE. HOUSING I. BEEN HERE BEFORE. OKAY WELL TURNED IT OVER TO YOU WHAT WILL FIRST HEAR FROM ELAINE. WELCOME ELAINE. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN BALLOT IN. CHAIRMAN CHU ON ITS SIDE. IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE THIS AFTERNOON AND SHARE WITH YOU INSIGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM EVERYONE HOMES DECADES LONG. WORK TO ENSURE EVERY RESIDENT OF ALAMEDA HIGHS SO SAFE AFFORDABLE HOME. I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE MY ENTIRE CAREER AND I'LL ASK YOU NOT TO DO ANY MATH HERE BUT THAT'S CLOSE TO THIRTY YEARS IN ALAMEDA COUNTY WORKING TO AND HOMELESSNESS. REALLY GOOD AND SO THAT MAKES ME. TWENTY FIVE. AND I DID SO I I DIDN'T. I AM VERY EXCITED BY THIS MOMENT IN TIME FOR THIS STATE. AND WHAT IT COULD MEAN FOR US TO TURN THE CURVE ON HOMELESSNESS IN THE HOUSING CRISIS. BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY GONNA TAKE SOME ATTENTIVE. STRATEGIC. I DESIGN OF HOW THESE RESOURCES GET USED. SO FOR FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DON'T KNOW EVERYONE HOME WE SERVICE ALAMEDA COUNTY'S HOMELESS CONTINUUM OF CARE WHICH IS A FEDERAL REQUIREMENT IN ORDER TO GET FEDERAL DOLLARS AND WE GOT ABOUT FORTY MILLION OF THOSE. AND WE ALSO SERVED AS THE BACKBONE ORGANIZATION SUPPORTING THE COUNTIES PLAN TO END HOMELESSNESS AND ENSURE EVERYONE HAS A SAFE PERMANENT HOME. AND WE'VE BEEN ON IT FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS AND ONE WE ADOPTED THE PLAN TEN YEARS AGO THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND ALL FOURTEEN OF OUR CITIES. OUR ADOPTED IT AND ONE OF THE MAJOR STRATEGIES THAT CALLED FOR WAS CREATING. MORE HOMES. AND WE HAVE CREATED MORE HOMES BUT LIKE THE REST OF THE STATE NOT AT THE PACE NEEDED AND FOR AWHILE. FOR THE FIRST EIGHT YEARS WE SAW ARE HOMELESS COUNTS GO DOWN THERE AND THEN TWO YEARS AGO. ARE AYE BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND SEVENTEEN ARE COUNT INCREASED. THIRTY NINE PERCENT. AND DIE SOME OF THAT WAS OUR NEW COUNT METHODOLOGY BUT IT WAS LIKE THE REST OF THE STATE MOSTLY ABOUT. HOMELESSNESS GOING NOT. ALSO IN MY COUNTY WERE FACING A FORTY FOUR THOUSAND UNIT GAP FOR. ARE EXTREMELY LOW INCOME RENTERS AND RENTS IN THE CITY OF OAKLAND HAVE GONE UP AT THE FASTEST PACE ARE IN THE NATION. EXCEPT ONE OTHER DISTRICT. AND DIED THEY'VE GONE UP FIFTY PERCENT IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. SO HERE WE ARE WE'VE GOT. BEAR AREA RESIDENTS IDENTIFYING THE COST OF HOUSING IS THE SINGLE. OUR MOST PRESSING CRISIS AND INCREASING NUMBERS OF OUR LIFELONG RESIDENTS ARE FORCED OUT OF THEIR HOMES AND NEIGHBORHOODS. AND THOSE WHO CAN MOVE EAST AND NORTH. BUT THOSE WHO CANNOT. JOIN THE GROWING POPULATION OF WHAT I LIKE TO CALL SADLY HOUSING REFUGEES. LIVING IN ON SHELTERED ON THE SIDEWALKS UNDERPASSES PARKS IN ARROYO'S OF EVERY COMMUNITY IN OUR COUNTY BUT. ACROSS THE STATE AND THESE INHUMANE CONDITIONS IN WHICH PEOPLE ON THE STREET FACE DAILY CALL US TO ADDRESS THIS HOUSING CRISIS WITH. CONTINUED SENSE OF URGENCY. AND TO FOCUS ON THOSE AT THE VERY BOTTOM OF THIS CRISIS. A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE STATE WITH OUT A HOME ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT. WE HOT WE'VE REALLY NEED TO BE THOUGHTFUL TO AVOID HAVING TRICKLED DOWN HOUSING POLICIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE FREQUENTLY. PRESUME THAT BUILDING HOUSING FOR ANYONE WILL HELP ALL PEOPLE THAT NEED AFFORDABLE HOUSING. BUT I WANNA SORT TO YOU TODAY. THAT MIDDLE INCOME AND AFFORDABLE AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSING WILL NOT SOLVE HOMELESSNESS. THE FOLKS WHO HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES IN MARKETS WHERE RENTS HAVE GONE OUT LIKE THE BAY AREA WILL NOT GET BACK INTO HOMES BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE MIDDLE INCOME HOMES. IN THEIR REGIONS AND COUNTIES NOT THAT MIDDLE INCOME HOMES ARE A BAD THING. BUT I THINK I KNOW THE VOTERS IN ALAMEDA COUNTY WHEN THEY PASSED THAT FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR HOUSING BOND DID IT THINKING THEY WERE ENDING HOMELESSNESS. SO WHAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE US TO THINK ABOUT WITH XP TWO IS REALLY TARGETING THOSE RESOURCES. BUT WHEN YOU SAY THERE FOR HOMELESS THE OTHER THING YOU GOTTA DO IS STOP THE INFLOWS INTO HOMELESSNESS AND INCREASE THE OUT FLOWS FROM HOMELESSNESS. IF WE BUILD MORE THINGS THAT HELP PEOPLE LIVE MORE HUMANELY BUT STAYED HOME ONCE. LIKE SHELTERS ARE SANCTIONED ENCAMPMENTS YOU WOULD JUST KEEP HAVING MORE HOMELESS. SO WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW THESE S. B. TWO DOLLARS. AND HOMELESSNESS I AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE US TO SUPPORT THINGS THAT SHOW RESULTS QUICKLY. CHIEF GOT A NUMBER OF MAJOR REGIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE BAY AREA HAS DONE IT SANTA CLARA ALAMEDA SAN FRANCISCO WE'VE GOT BONDS. AND WE'RE BUILDING UNITS NOW WE CAN USE S. B. TO MONEY. SUBSIDIZE THE RENTS IN THOSE UNITS AND REQUIRED THE PEOPLE THAT MOVED IN THERE HAVE BEEN HOME. IF YOU BUILDING YOU KNOW THAT FIFTY PERCENT A ON MY NO ONE BIT THAT'S BEEN HOMELESS WILL EVER BE ABLE TO AFFORD THAT UNIT. SIXTY PERCENT OF THE ADULTS WHO EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS IN OUR ME TO COUNTY ARE ON DISABILITY. AND RETIREMENT BENEFITS. RAPID RE HOUSING IS A GOOD STRATEGY BUT IT WON'T WORK FOR THOSE FOLKS THEY WON'T EVER AFFORD RANKS IN OUR MARKET. SO FOR PAIN TO BUILD THESE UNITS AND WE WANT THESE UNITS TO AND HOMELESSNESS WE'VE GOTTA SUBSIDIZE HOMELESS PEOPLE'S ACCESS TO THESE UNITS. AND YOU'VE GOT PROJECTS COMING ONLINE WITH LOCAL BONDS AS SOON AS THAT NO FOUR COMES OUT. YOU COULD BUY YOUR WAY INTO HIM FOR HER WITH HOPE BOB WITH SP TWO DOLLARS FOR HOMELESS PEOPLE. AND THAT IS REALLY THE CAO PORCINE WE'VE DONE A LOT OF GOOD WORK IN THE STATE AROUND PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH. BUT THE REAL GAP IS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DIAZ TO. POOR TO PAY THE RENT AND THEY'RE ON FIXED INCOMES SO THEIR INCOME ISN'T GOING TO CHANGE AND WE COULD REALLY USE I SPEAK TO. THERE. THANK. YEAH GOOD AFTERNOON NOTHING SIR HAVE ME HERE APPRECIATE IT. SENATOR. BELLE AND SIR CHIU. SO. IN MY ABOUT BY ANY MAY NOTICE I'M ACTUALLY FROM DETROIT MICHIGAN. I'M I'VE BEEN DOING THIS WORK I JUST OVER TEN YEARS NOW. SINCE THAT GRADUATING COLLEGE. AND. YOU KNOW RELOCATING TO CALIFORNIA PASSED A FIVE MONTHS MY WIFE IS FROM THE AREA MERCED COUNTY. AND ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT HAPPENED WHEN WE. MOVED HERE WAS THAT SHE BROKE DOWN IN TEARS SING THE NUMBER OF CODDLING HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS LIVING ON THE STREETS. BECAUSE IT WASN'T THE HOME THAT SHE HAD LAUGHED WHEN SHE MOVED TO MICHIGAN. AND SO HOME THROUGH THE IN KNOWING MIKE SWINGS THE CHRONIC HOMELESS THAT SHE'S LIKE YOU YOU KNOW LOOK YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. AND. WHICH KIND OF BRINGS US HERE DO THINKING STRATEGICALLY ABOUT HIGH SPEED TO AND HOW THIS IS MOVING TOWARD SOLVING FOR CHRONICALLY HOMELESS. AND HOMELESSNESS HOME. AND SO AND WHEN WORKING WITH LOCAL. AND COMMUNITY SOMERSET COUNTY THIS YEAR'S COUNT ACCESS ON INCREASE AND I'M HOMELESSNESS. WHAT WE DO HAVE ACCESS TO RAPIDLY HOUSING DOLLARS? BUT WE HAVE A LACK OF OF HOUSING IN GENERAL WE HAVE A ONE PERCENT VACANCY RATE LESSEN UPS AND WE CAN SEE RATE. WHEN IT COMES TO APPLYING FOR PERMITS. WE HAVE. FOR EVERY UNIT THAT ONE OF OUR INDIVIDUALS APPLIES TO FOR HOUSING HERE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS A COMPETING AGAINST SEVENTY FIVE OTHER INDIVIDUALS FOR THAT UNIT. SO. COMPETITIVELY THEY JUST CAN'T COMPETE I'M SO DESPITE HAVING RESOURCES WE YOU KNOW RAPPER HOUSING TEAMS ARE UNABLE TO HOUSE INDIVIDUALS. SECONDLY THERE IS A LACK TO OF OUTREACH WORKERS. IN IN THE COMMUNITY. SO WHEN DEALING WITH CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS. I'M IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT YOU KNOW THE ONE WHERE I REACHING LEAVING THESE INDIVIDUALS AND LOOKING FOR PLACEMENT HOUSING THAT THEY'RE BEING LIED TO COMMUNITY SERVICES. BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES AND THIS ISN'T MEANING JUST INFORMATION REFERRAL THIS IS LITERALLY TAKING THEM TO APPOINTMENTS WALKING THEM THROUGH SERVICES. THE STEP BY STEP WITH THEM IN PREPARATION FOR FOR HOUSING AND BECAUSE IT JUST HOUSING ALONE WILL NOT SOLVE THE ISSUE. I'VE SUPERVISED MULTIPLE PERMITS FOR SUPPORT HOUSING PROJECTS IN IF THE SUPPORTS AND HOUSING ARE EFFICIENT. MORE LIKELY NOT THE INDIVIDUAL WILL END UP BACK ON THE STREET SO IT'S VERY IMPERATIVE THAT AN SP TWO THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE AT THIS. OPTION OF NOT ONLY BUILDING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND MORE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WHICH IS DESPERATELY NEEDED. FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS BUT LOOKING AT THE SUPPORT SITE AN ASPECT THINGS TO WITH STAFFING. I'M FROM HOW REACH ANY IN INTO HOUSING AS WELL. AND SO. AND WITH THAT SIDE OF SHELTER LOW BARRIERS FILTERS VERY KEY TO. YOU KNOW IT'S NOT JUST A PLACE FOR THEM TO GO AND STAY IT'S A PLACE FROM TO GO AND SEE BEGAN. YOU KNOW BEING CONNECTED TO SERVICES TO FOR LONG TERM. LONG TERM HOUSING OR PERMITS TO BE PLACE INTO PERMANENT HOUSING LONG TERM. SO A PART OF THE BILL MISSIONS AND NAVIGATION SINNERS. AND SO I NOTICE THE SAN FRANCISCO HAS DONE SOME NEW BILLS. I'M FOR NAVIGATION CENTERS THAT ARE INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE. FOR OUR COMMUNITY I OVERSEE OUR SHELTER OPERATIONS LOOKING AT CHANGING OUR SHELTER STRUCTURES AND HOW WE OPERATE WITHIN COMMUNITIES TO MOVING TOWARDS. AND NAVIGATION CENTER IS BEING ABLE TO SAVE COSTS FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. TO SPEND MORE OF THEIR DOLLARS ON HOUSING AND WHAT SOME BUILDING AND AT NEW CAPITAL ONE BRICK AND MORTAR LIKING SHELTERS AND NEW NAVIGATION CENTERS. SO TAKING DOLLARS INITIALLY MAY BE A FRY AYE LOW COST INVESTING IN OUR SHELTERS AND RESEARCHING HOW THEY OPERATE AND INVEST MORE MONEY. LONG TERM FOR HOUSING. AS KIND OF WHAT WE KNOW WE'RE THINKING WOULD WORK FOR OUR OUR COMMUNITY COMMITTEE LOCALLY. BUT. IF YOU KNOW LARA. GREAT. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY. AREA. BETTER. HAVE I'D LIKE TO START FIRST BY THANKING YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE ON THIS COMMITTEE AND CONGRATULATE YOU FOR THE SUCCESS IN MOVING THE HOUSING PACKAGE FORWARD LAST YEAR. IS ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO OR SO THAT I WAS I'M HERE TESTIFYING IN SACRAMENTO I'M SO HAPPY THAT SOME ACTION WAS TAKEN. AND I WERE READY TO GO TO PRODUCE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AT JAMBOREE WE TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF ALL OF THE FUNDING PROGRAMS AVAILABLE HERE UP AT THE STATE. AND THAT'S HELPED US PRODUCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR FAMILY SENIORS. AND THOSE WHO ARE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS LIVING WITH SPECIAL NEEDS INCLUDING OUR VETERANS AND OTHERS. WE OPEN THE FIRST DEVELOPMENT USING THE CAP AND TRADE FUNDING JUST. HERE IN WEST SACRAMENTO NOT TOO FAR AWAY AND YEARS BACK WE OPEN THE FIRST. PERMITS PORT OF HOUSING DEVELOPMENT FUNDED WITH THE HOMELESS GOVERNOR'S HOMELESS INITIATIVE FUNDING. I SO AGAIN WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT WHAT'S TO COME. JAMBOREE WAS AN ACTIVE RECIPIENT OF THE REDEVELOPMENT FUNDING WITH AN AVERAGE OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER UNIT OF SUBSIDY WHICH PRODUCE STAR OVER EIGHT THOUSAND UNITS IN OUR PORTFOLIO. WE NOW HAVE OVER SIXTEEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS THAT LIVE IN OUR PROPERTIES. BECAUSE OF A COMBINATION OF THESE FUNDING SOURCES. WHEN I TALK ABOUT THE LOSS OF REDEVELOPMENT OFTENTIMES PEOPLE SAY C'MON WHERE YOU GOTTA MOVE ON FROM THIS YOU KNOW IT WAS QUITE AWHILE AGO NOW BUT. ONE OF THE SIDE AND SIDE NOTES TO THE ELIMINATION OF REDEVELOPMENT UNFORTUNATELY WAS A COUPLE THINGS. THE FIRST ONE IS THAT AS YOUR WHERE THE HOUSING ELEMENT ONLY REQUIRES YOU TO PLAN FOR HOUSING IT DOESN'T REQUIRE YOU TO BUILD IT. THE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY IMPLEMENTATION PLANS ACTUALLY REQUIRED YOU TO BUILD IT SO THINK ABOUT THAT NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IF YOU DIDN'T BUILD THE HAVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. YOU COULD NOT BRING IN THE BIG BOX RETAILERS YOU COULDN'T BRING IN THE AUTO MALLS. RIGHT AND SO A DIRECT CORRELATION TO THAT REDUCTION OF TAX REVENUES COMING INTO THAT JURISDICTION. SO THAT CAUSED THEM TO MAKE SURE MANY MOST EXCEPT FOR THE REAL BAD BOYS BUT MOST OF THEM TO PRODUCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND THAT'S ELIMINATED ALONG WITH THAT WAS MANY OF THE STAFF THAT WORKED IN OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS EITHER RETIRED WERE LAID OFF OR REMOVE TOGETHER TO OTHER POSITIONS SO. WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS WE HAVE MANY CITIES THAT OF COURSE NO LONGER HAVE FUNDING THEY NO LONGER HAVE LAND? AND THEY NO LONGER HAVE STAFF THAT EDUCATED IN THIS IS KIND OF TAKING ME TO THE S. B. TO. I'M OPPORTUNITY HERE IN TERMS OF EDUCATION SO EDUCATING THE NEW STAFF THAT ARE COMING IN ON HOW TO GET AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS PRODUCED. EVEN THOSE WHO MIGHT OF TOUCH DID IN THE PAST DID ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES RIGHT IS AT THE TIME THEY HAD LAND THEY COULD GO OUT FOR AN RFP THEY COULD PUT TOGETHER THE LAYERS OF FINANCING. THE WAY THEY WANTED IT TO IT'S MUCH DIFFERENT NOW FOR JAMBOREE WILL WORK GOING OUT WERE ACTUALLY HAVING TO TIE UP LAND. OFTENTIMES TAKE IT DOWN EARLY GET BRIDGE FINANCING WORKING AND TOTALLY NEW DIFFERENT WAYS OF FINANCING ARE PROJECTS. THAT WE DID IN THE PAST AND SO I THINK THAT AND IT WOULD BE VERY VERY HELPFUL FOR THE SP TWO FUNDING THAT'S GOING TO THE LOCAL LEVELS TO OF COURSE. AND. WORK WITH THOSE JURISDICTIONS ON UPDATING THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT THERE'S STONING CODES ALL OF THE TECHNICAL. AND PROGRAMS NEEDED TO MOVE HOUSING FORWARD BUT ALSO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. TO DO JUST GENERAL EDUCATION SO SEVEN YEARS AGO WHEN WE FINANCED THE FIRST PERMITS PART OF HOUSING. I'M PROJECT THERE IN ORANGE COUNTY WE DID TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF OUTREACH INITIALLY THE PROJECT WAS TURNED DOWN IT WAS THE MOST HORRIFIC PUBLIC. HEARING I'D EVER BEEN OUT WERE ALL KINDS OF MISINFORMATION WAS SPREAD ABOUT THE CHILD MOLESTERS WHO WERE GOING TO BE LIVING AT THE PROPERTY. WE HAD CHILDREN STAND UP AT THE MICROPHONE AND THEN KURT PRINGLE WAS MAYOR SOME OF YOU KNOW KURT. AND SAY TO HIM. PLEASE DON'T PUT THESE FOLKS IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD AND IT TOOK SO MUCH EDUCATION AND FINALLY HE SAID OR YOU GOTTA BRING THE PROJECT BACK WERE READY TO FUND THE PROJECT WE FUNDED IT NOW FLASH FORWARD. SEVEN YEARS LATER AND I HAD THE ASSISTANT CITY MANAGER IN THAT SAME CITY SAY TO ME. SO YOU'RE REALLY GONNA PUT PEOPLE LIVING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AND THAT PROPERTY AND IS THAT GOING TO BE OKAY. RIGHT AND IT WAS JUST A FLASH RIGHT NOW I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LONG TIME GREAT. AND I THOUGHT SO AGAIN WE HAVE TO DO TOWARDS WE HAVE TO EDUCATE AND SO I THINK IF YOU GO BACK TO THAT SPEAK TO FUNDING. ALLOWING STAFF TO USE THOSE FUNDS TO EDUCATE THE NEW COUNCIL PEOPLE WHO OF COMMENT AND THE NEW SENIOR STAFF WHO ARE MAKING DECISIONS AND I NEED TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO MOVE FORWARD. WE'RE WORKING IN ONE CITY RIGHT NOW AND I NORTH ORANGE COUNTY THAT JUST DECLARED AN EMERGENCY AND YOU MIGHT BE SEEN THE CITIES ARE DECLARING AN EMERGENCY FOR THE HOMELESS ISSUES YOU SEE ON TV IN ORANGE COUNTY. THEY'RE CLEARING THE RIVER BEDS AND THE JUDGE CAME IN NEGOTIATED THE DEAL WHERE THEY WOULD ALLOW THEM TO REMOVE THE. HOMELESS FOLKS. FROM THE RIVER BAD IF THEY WOULD PROVIDE A HOUSING VOUCHER A THIRTY DAY HOUSING VOUCHERS. WHAT IS SO IRONIC IN THIS SITUATION THIS IS THE CITY THAT WE RIGHT NOW HAVE A MOTEL UNDER CONTRACT WERE ATTEMPTING TO CONVERT IT FROM ME? RUN DOWN MOTEL INTO. FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A UNIT OF THREE HAVE INTO A BEAUTIFUL PERMITS PART OF HOUSING DEVELOPMENT ALL KINDS OF. IMPACTFUL RESIDENTS SERVICES IN THE SAME COMMUNITY AND THEY'RE TELLING US IT'S GONNA TAKE THREE YEARS BECAUSE THEY HAVE AN OUTDATED ZONING ORDINANCE. AND THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT AND THEY HAVE TO WE HAVE TO DO THE COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND I SAID TO THE. THE LEAD STAFF FOLKS YOU DO REALIZE THAT FOLKS ARE BEING RELOCATED INTO THOSE MOTELS RIGHT NOW THAT ARE NOT BEING FIXED UP. THAT ARE PROBABLY GOING TO STAY LONGER THAN THIRTY DAYS BECAUSE AS THE JUDGE REALLY GOING AND THEN JUST ALLOW THEM TO GO ON TO THE STREET A MEMBER TALK ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE. SO ANYWAYS THERE'D IS A CRISIS I'M EXCITED THAT THERE'S GONNA BE FUNDING COMING FORWARD I THINK THAT THERE'S. THE MOST. FLEXIBILITY WE CAN HAVE IN THE USE OF HOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN USE THAT EDUCATE AND INFORM. TOURS STATEWIDE TORS TO TRY TO EASE ANY FEAR THAT PEOPLE HAVE I THINK WOULD BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL. AND. I THINK IT JUST SOME COMMENTS ON THE FAIR SHARE ISSUE ON WHO'S GETTING WHAT IF YOU CAN LOOK TO YOUR. FIVE YEAR GOOD USERS IN TERMS OF THOSE CITIES THAT KNOW HOW TO DO IT KNOW HOW TO GET IT DONE. IT. OF RUNNING A NONPROFIT BUT A BUSINESS OBVIOUSLY AT JAMBOREE WE'VE HAD TO DO THAT YOU CAN'T STAY IN BUSINESS IF YOU'RE JUST GONNA KEEP. GOING UP AGAINST THE CITY THAT'S NEVER GOING TO GO ANYWHERE AND. UNFORTUNATELY THAT WE SAW THAT WITH SOME REDEVELOPMENT WERE SOME CITIES DIDN'T SPEND THEIR MONEY. AND THEN. AGAIN PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING REALLY BEING THE ANSWER. VERSE SAYS. SPENDING MONEY ON OTHER ALTERNATIVES WHICH DO NOT GET US THE END PRODUCT LIKE WE'RE SEEING WITH THESE MOTEL VOUCHERS. SO I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME OF THANK YOU THREE PANELISTS INTO. YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW YOU TALK TO ABOUT IT SPEAK TO WIN THAT'S WE SAW HOW. THE HOUSING DEPARTMENT. BUT. WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT TO EIGHTEEN IN THE NEXT PANEL BY CASH TO. SUPPOSE SO. THE HOUSE THERE IS IN THE LEGISLATURE IN THERE ALL COUNTY HERE BUNCH OF US. GOT TOGETHER AND WE GOT SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDS OUT OF THE SURPLUS TO STATE HOUSE. HOW HOW QUICKLY CAN THAT MONEY BE USED? AND WHAT WOULD YOU YOU JUST OUTLINED FOR. WELL I YEAH SO I KNEW. COULD YOU WOULD HELP US GET. YEAH  <u><c.green>ADDITIONAL FUNDS FROM</c></u> OTHER SOURCES AND BE. WOULD IT HELP. GOVERNMENT SO COSTS OF HOMELESSNESS. BE REDUCED WRITTEN WELL AB I IN I BELIEVE ABSOLUTELY THAT WHATEVER FUNDING COULD BE MADE AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY. AS IN THE JOURNAL WHICH COULD PUT BE PUT DIRECTLY INTO PROJECTS VERY QUICKLY SO GIVEN THE ORANGE COUNTY EXAMPLE THAT'S WHERE OUR HEADQUARTERS ARE SO I I SPEAK TO THAT MOST. IS WE'VE GOT. RIGHT NOW TWELVE HUNDRED UNITS IN OUR DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE AND WE'RE WORKING WITH THE COUNTY SUPERVISORS TO TRY TO FREE UP. ALL THE FUNDING THAT THEY HAVE BECAUSE THAT WE KNOW IT'S IT'S WE'RE GONNA MAX THAT OUT. I ALONG WITH ALL OF THEIR VOUCHERS TO TRY A GET THAT HOUSING PRODUCED RIGHT AWAY WORKING WITH THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES AN AC CO SEE. DOWN THERE WITH OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WHAT WE DID WAS WE TOOK IS ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND IN THE COUNT IN ORANGE COUNTY. SO WE'VE TAKEN THAT WE'VE DIVIDED THAT BY CITIES SO THAT CITIES DON'T FEEL THAT THEY'RE TAKING MORE THAN THEIR FAIR SHARE BECAUSE THAT'S AN ISSUE WHEN YOU'RE WORKING WITH LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS. AND WE'VE DIVIDED THAT HAPPEN IF SAID CAN YOU GIVE US A COMMITMENT CAN YOU TALK TO US ABOUT SITES. WE JAMBOREE PUSHING TO GET AHEAD OF THIS WE HAVE THE SITES TIED UP AGAIN FOR ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED UNITS AND WE'RE READY TO GO SO EVERY. THREE TO FOUR MONTHS OUR PLAN IS TO START APPLYING FOR FUNDING FROM THE COUNTY YEAH STATE FUNDING COMES OUT WILL COME RIGHT INTO THE STATE AND THEN GETTING INTO. A TAX CREDIT ROUND OBVIOUSLY THERE'S NOT GONNA BE ENOUGH NINE PERCENT TAX CREDITS TO FUND THIS SO WE HAVE A BOND AND FOUR PERCENT MODEL THAT WE'RE WORKING ON. WHICH YOU KNOW IS KIND OF WHERE THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM HAS GONE WHICH IS A NICE SUPPLEMENT TO THAT PROGRAM WHICH WOULD WORK IF SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING WAS AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY WE COULD. START GETTING SOME OF THE BOND AND FOUR PERCENT PROJECTS MOVING I THINK THE LAND AS. LUKE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT. HOUSING WHERE IT'S. SERVICES AND THE HOUSING. HOW WOULD WE DO THAT? YOU KNOW LIKE I LOOK AT. META CAO. THERE'S. LET FIFTEEN WAIVER YOU KNOW THAT ALLOWS. SOME MEDICAL SERVICES TO BE PUT. BLENDED WITH. I THINK IT'S ELEVEN FIFTEEN WHERE I AM RIGHT. YEAH ALLOWS THE BLENDING OF THE MEDI CAL SERVICES IN A HOUSING PROJECT TO HIRE LIKE A SOCIAL PSYCHIATRIC SOCIAL WORKERS. YOU KNOW YOU KNOW MEDICAL STAFF EXETER A TO PROVIDE. DE. SERVICES IN THOSE. SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. AND. HOW WOULD YOU IF IF THERE WERE THESE KIND OF FUNDS HOW WITH AB HOW WOULD THAT WORK? IS ANYBODY DON'T ALLOW THAT KIND OF THING SO ALAMEDA COUNTY IS IS EXILE AND RELIEVE ROPE ROWING OUT. BIG IT WHAT WERE LIKE WE HAVE LAUNCHED COORDINATED ENTRY WERE USING A WHOLE PERSON CARE DOLLARS WHICH INCLUDED THAT. AT THE MEDICARE WAIVER. I IN IN ORDER TO GENERATE MONEY YEAH YEAH. SINCE BALLOTS OTHERWISE SHRINKING. IT'S GOOD TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT SO WE WE HAVE ABOUT TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS GOING INTO SUPPORTING CARE COORDINATION AND COORDINATED AND TREE AND. BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE. UNFORTUNATELY A LOT ABOUT MONEY TRIES OFTEN IN ANOTHER THREE YEARS. SO I I. GOT THAT BRINGS ME TO. A POINT I WAS GETTING TOO FIRED UP TO MAKE IN MY EARLIER REMARKS ABOUT S. B. TWO I KNOW THE FIRST YEAR IS DEDICATED TO HOMELESSNESS BUT I THINK THE WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN LOOK AT. ONGOING FUNDING AND INCENTIVIZING OR BURKE BOARDING AND I'M GOING COMMITMENT TO ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS LIKE. SOMETHING WE JUST DO ONE YEAR REALLY ISN'T GONNA SAVAGE PEOPLE NEED I'M GOING DEEP SUPPORT TO TO STAY HOUSED IN CALIFORNIA'S MARKET SO. I AT WHICH ALSO DOWN THERE POINT I WANTED TO MAKE ABOUT THAT I KNOW KIND OF THE FASTEST PATH TO GETTING THE MONEY OUT THE DOOR FROM STATE H. CD. IS TO FOLLOW THE. ESG PROGRAM DESIGN BUT THAT DOESN'T REALLY ALLOW FOR PERMANENT SUBSIDIES AND SUPPORT AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY WHERE THE CAPTAINS COULD DO. THESE HOUSING TRUST. THEY HAVE ENOUGH FLEXIBILITY ARE POLL OF STUFF TOGETHER ARE I THINK THE ONE THING I DON'T NEED A COUNTY IS THE CAPITAL. ITS CAPITAL SO I THINK THAT I THINK THAT WITH THE COUNTY. CAP THE CAPITAL. I'M SURE HOUSING TRUST IN AND THEIR OPERATING. THE COUNTY CAN WORK OUT THE BLENDS. OF FROM. AYE I THINK SO BUT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT IF THE I THINK IT THE STATE KEEPS SP TWO FLEXIBLE TO COMPROMISE OPERATING RESERVES AND IF YOU GET THE NEW MONEY WITH A IS IT TO EIGHTEEN YOU SAT DOWN. AND AND AGAIN I THINK YOU'VE GOT REGION'S THAT HOBBES STUFF IN THE PIPELINE BECAUSE OF THEIR LOCAL BOND MEASURES. AND AND SO REALLY GETTING THOSE ACROSS THE LINE DEVELOPMENT WISE WAR GETTING GETTING ACCESS FOR THE EXTREMELY LOW INCOME FOLKS INTO THOSE BUILDINGS ARE ZERO SUBSTANCE ABUSE SO FEDERAL MONEY NOW THE CURES ACT. HOW'S THAT. DOES THAT COME INTO PLAY HERE WITH HOMELESS. PROGRAM SO WE CAN PUT. SUBSTANCE ABUSE LE. TREATMENT. MONEY OF FEDERAL MONEY AND THERE'S MORE FEDERAL MONEY FIRST SERVICES MONEY CLEAN YOU KNOW WE. WE YEAH WE'RE LOSING SEATED BJ WERE LOSING ALL YOU KNOW WE'RE WHERE WE GOT THE BUDGET CUT BUT THEN THEY LEFT SOME OF THESE OTHER PROGRAMS. THAT WE HAVE TO START. WE. FOCUS SAYING. EVERYTHING TO OR WHATEVER MONEY IS LEFT THE. AND AND I I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU AND I THINK WE CAN SUPPORT THE YOU MIGHT HAVE A CA THAT WAY I'M GOING GOV ACCORDING TO SUDHIR MOHAN. YEAH. I THINK COUNTY SUPERVISOR LEVEL ADVANCEMENT SERVICES. THERE ARE SERVICES DOLLARS WE NEED SOME BUT THEY'RE MORE AVAILABLE I REALLY THINK IT'S OPERATING COSTS THAT THE STATE COULD HELP SUPPORT FOR THIS AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO IT IS MORE AFFORDABLE TO THE POOREST TALK TO STAY PUT OUT SOME KIND OF. TICE MINT IF YOU WANT YEAH THAT WAY YEAH FOR. COUNTIES THAT WILL HAVE LIKE IT'S AFFORDABLE. THEY CAN DO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE COULD WE COULD. DO OUR HOUSING FUNDS AND THEN. PUT SOME ENTICEMENT. ARE. HEALTHCARE DOLLARS HEALTH HUMAN SERVICES DOLLARS ON THE TABLE. YEAH WELL BEYOND THAT WOULD LOOK GOOD TO THE COUNTIES AND THEY'D. YES I THINK THE GREAT YEAH I DON'T HELP ABSOLUTELY. AND WERE SEEN A TARGET FOR BATTERED WOMEN SUBSTANCE ABUSE MENTAL HEALTH. THOUGH. DOUBLE TRIPLE CHO PURGING DISORDERS YOU TRY LE. PSYCHIATRIC. DUH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY. I THINK THERE'S A LOT HOMELESS WALKING AROUND THERE REALLY DEVELOP THE DISABLED THEY HAVE BRAIN DAMAGE THE. YOU KNOW LIKE YOU SAY THEY DO SHOULD BE ON SS I WE SHOULD TRY TO GIVE ALL. SOME OF MARK ON SS I WISH TO GET ON A SOCIETY SHOULD GET FOOD STAMPS OR NOT ON FOOD STAMPS. I MEAN THEY'RE NOT GETTING ALL THIS FEDERAL. STUFF THAT YOU KNOW IF THEY WERE HOMELESS THAT WE'D GOOD. WE HAD HOUSING WE CAN HAVE THE SOCIAL WORKERS. FOR ANY NOT OUT ALTOGETHER EXACTLY AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING WITH THE PERMITS PART OF HOUSING IN HERE IN SACRAMENTO WITH HOTEL BURIAL. HUGO BY HOTEL BARRY WE WERE ABLE TO PURCHASE THAT WITH US A TURN REYES HELP. PUT I'M HOMELESS FOLKS IN THERE WHO REALLY HAD NO INCOME BUT OVER TIME YOU FIGURE OUT THERE ELIGIBLE THEIR INCOME JUSTICE A GREAT NOW WE HAVE TWENTY FIVE VETERANS IN THERE. WERE ABLE TO GET RESOURCES FOR THAT OBSERVANCE. IN THE CENTER THERE HAVE TO VETERANS. ARE NOT THERE HOMELESS HAVE TO VETERANS TOTAL THAT HER. THAT HER ELIGIBLE. FOR VETERANS A MEDICAL ASSISTANCE ARE NOT GETTING IT IN CALIFORNIA. THEY'RE NOT GETTING THAT THE MONEY THAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FORGET THEY'RE NOT GETTING IT. SO SO LIKE THEN AND THAT AND I KNOW THE SNAP PROGRAM THE FOOD STAMP PROGRAM SIMPLY. IS ALWAYS PEOPLE WALK AROUND THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE. THERE ARE ELIGIBLE FOR NOT GETTING INTO. THAT'S MONEY FOR YOUR. RIGHT AND WHAT WE SEE WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IT IS MEASURING THE FOLKS WHO ARE IN OUR FIFTY TO SIXTY PERCENT AND MY UNITS WHO GO OFF OF THE FOOD. SUBSIDY PROGRAMS HOW MUCH THAT SAVING GOVERNMENT AND THEN IF YOU JUST ADJUST THAT SO THAT THEN IT SERVING THOSE WHO WERE AT THE STRIP EXTREMELY LOW INCOME. WHO HAVE? THE DISABILITIES THEN YOU'RE ADJUSTING IT THE RIGHT WAY. WE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON FOOD IN THE COUNTY JAIL ON THE. STATE PRISON THE FOOD IS ALL HUNDRED PERCENT FUNDED BY THE. THE COUNTY OR THE STATE GENERAL FUND IT'S THERE'S NO FEDERAL SUBSIDY THERE. YEAH WELL I ERA SO. STATE FUNDED FOOD AND ALL. YEAH SO I'VE ALWAYS KINDA LAUGHED AT THIS YOU KNOW SLICK. WE WERE WE WHERE FULLER WERE INSANE IN TERMS OF THE WAY WE. TRY TO DO PROGRAMS. DOESN'T WORK WHAT'S WRONG WITH BUILT ON THIS HOUSING BUILDING REBUILDING AND PRISONS. THAT'S THAT WAS THE DISCUSSION IN ORANGE COUNTY WHEN THEY CLEAR THE RIVER BEDS WITH OKAY HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE EARLY RELEASE WHILE THE REALITY IS. YOU WANT TO PAY TO HOUSE THEM IN THE. IN THE CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM READY WANT TO HELP SUPPORT THEIR MY HOUSING AND. AND GETTING ON THAT THE CARE THAT THEY NEED FOR. SO A FEW QUESTIONS FIRST ARE COMMENTED TO MISS OUR CHILDREN. UP I APPRECIATE YOUR SHARING THE STORY OF HOW IT IT'S TAKEN THREE YEARS TO BUILD UP PERMITS SUPPORTIVE HOUSING SITE. I'VE A BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW CONTINUE TO FURTHER STREAMLINE THE DEVELOPMENT OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING BECAUSE WE ARE HEARING FROM ORGANIZATIONS AT THAT THREE YEAR MARK IS ACTUALLY FAIRLY TYPICAL. STORY AND THAT IS OBVIOUSLY UNACCEPTABLE WITH HOW MUCH MONEY OR TRY TO GET OUT TO US TO LOCALS TO DO THIS BUT THE QUESTION THAT I HAVE A REALLY FOR. MS THE COLONY IN AND ALSO MISS. MISS ARCHULETA. I THINK I HEARD. MISS OUR CHIU IT YOU SAY THAT. LOCAL FLEXIBILITY IS IS IS MOST HELPFUL AT THIS POINT GETTING MONEY OUT TO LOCALS IN ALLOWING LOCALS TO TO. APPLY THAT MONEY IS USE BEST SEE FIT TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS IS IMPORTANT WHAT I HEARD EARLIER. Y. SAID. THERE IS A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE A DIFFERENT SCHOOL OF THOUGHT THAT WE'VE BEEN WASTING MONIES. SPENDING IT IN THE WRONG PLACES AND THAT WHAT WE REALLY OUGHT TO FOCUS ON. TO TO TO. ECHO WHAT. MS. MY APOLOGIES BOTH YOUR NAMES LOCALES. DE COLLINI. THE LANE LOWER THAT MIGHT BE EASIER. BUT ALAIN YOUR COMMENTS WHAT YOU WOULD SET WAS IF WE STOP PEOPLE FROM BECOMING HOMELESS AND THEN FIGURE OUT HOW TO HELP FOLKS WERE ON THE RULES TO GET OFF THAT'S REALLY WHERE WE OUGHT TO FOCUS OUR OUR DOLLARS AND. I WANTED TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU. THOSE TWO THAT DOES SEEM TO BE TWO SCHOOLS OF THOUGHTS I MEAN I'LL TELL YOU I COME FROM A CITY. THAT HAS SPENT CLOSE TO FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TRYING TO ADDRESS HE FIVE TO SEVEN THOUSAND. HOMELESS FOLKS IN ANY PARTICULAR. TIME AND WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE IT DEBT AND SO. A IT SEEMS TO SUGGEST WE'RE NOT DOING SOMETHING RIGHT WITH HOW WE'RE TRYING TO SPEND OUR MONIES. AND MY GUESS IS AROUND STATE WE SPENT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TRYING TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS IN ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT FORMS. ARE AND REALLY STRUGGLING DOING. ALL THAT BEING SAID I THINK WE HAVE TO SPEND MORE BUT I WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE SPENDING. IN THE RIGHT WAY SO COULD THE TWO OF YOU. TEASE OUT THAT. ARGUMENT I'M HEARING FROM DIFFERENT QUARTERS OF HOW WE AS POLICY MAKERS OUGHT TO THINK ABOUT. HOW MONIES ARE SPENT? WHAT I I? REALLY WE'RE JUST UPDATING OUR TEN YEAR PLAN SO I'VE I'VE BEEN DOING SOME ANALYSIS ON THAT INFLOWS INTO HOMELESSNESS SO THAT. THE MOST ACCURATE DATA POINT WE ALL HAVE THIS THE POINT TIME COUNT WHEN WERE WONDERING IF STREETS OF OUR COUNTIES DISTRICTS. LOOKING FOR FOLKS SLEEPING OUTSIDE. BUT WE ASK THE FOLKS IN ALAMEDA COUNTY HOW LONG THEY BEEN HOMELESS IN TWO PERCENT OF THEM OUT OF THE TWELVE HUNDRED WE SURVEYED. SAID A WEAKER LASS SO WE MULTIPLY THAT TIMES FIFTY TWO WEEKS AND ALMOST AS MANY PEOPLE NOW WITH A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR PEOPLE BECOMING HOMELESS EACH WEEK. IN OUR COUNTY. AND THE HOUSE FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE YEARS THAT'S THEIR FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED HOUSEHOLDS THAT'S THE SAME NUMBER WE COUNTED ON THAT ONE GIVE THE NINE. SO IT'S IT MONEY STOP. AND SO. YOU KNOW WERE WERE PULLING THE BABIES OUT OF THE RIVER AND NO ONE'S GOING UPSTREAM TO SEE WHO'S THROWING BABIES IN THE RECORD BREAKING WERE BUILDING FANCIER BOATS AND FAST APPROACHING MORE EXPENSIVE BUT TO GET IN THE WATER FOR THE BABY'S GETTING THROWN INTO THE PEOPLE ON THE STREET. SO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN ALAMEDA COUNTY IS. HOUSING A COUPLE THOUSAND FOLKS A YEAR BUT WE'RE NOT KEEPING UP WITH THAT LEVEL OF. IMPORT SO I DO YOU REALLY THINK LOOKING AT. SO. I'M GOING TO TOUCH A THIRD RAIL HERE BUT I THINK COSTA HAWKINS SOMETHING TO LOOK AT TO. I'M THINKING ABOUT REPEALING IT SAID THAT TALK ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL. LOCAL FLEXIBILITY AND RENDER PROTECTIONS BECAUSE WE ARE JUST KICKING PEOPLE OUT OF RENTAL HOUSING IN OUR COUNTIES FROM BECAUSE FREEZING FROM CONVERSION. AND DISPLACEMENT AND WERE NOT BUILDING ENOUGH A PUBLICLY FUNDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING SAID THE PRIVATE MARKET IS JUST KICKING PEOPLE INTO HOMELESSNESS SO WE CANNOT. WE GOT TO TAKE SOME ACTION TO STABILIZE THAT. PRIVATE MARKETS I WOULD SAY BECAUSE THEY ARE A DEFINITE. SOURCE FOR PEOPLE BECOMING HOMELESS AND THEN I THINK WE CAN TAKE SOME ACTIONS IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. FIELD TO HELP SUBSIDIZE IT MORE DEEPLY SO THAT REALLY POOR PEOPLE CAN GET INTO THE UNITS WERE SPENDING PUBLIC DOLLARS TO BAIL AND. SO I'M I'M NOT SURE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DIFFERENT THINGS HERE I JUST I THINK WE'RE WE'RE SAYING THAT. AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS HAVE THE COSTS THEY HAVE. IT COSTS A THOUSAND DOLLARS TO RUN THE UNIT IN THESE. URBAN MARKETS AND A PERSON ON SS I CAN ONLY AFFORD TO PAY THREE HUNDRED SO WE'VE GOT TO MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE. YEAH I MEAN I'VE. FOCUS WILL ALWAYS BE ON PRODUCTION BECAUSE I THINK WHERE EVER YOU ARE AT THE MORE UNITS IN THE MORE CHOICE YOU HAVE THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE. APPLY DEMAND COMING INTO PLACE BUT I THINK WHEN YOU GET TO THE MOST VULNERABLE THOSE WHO ARE LIVING WITH DISABILITIES. THOSE IN THE EXTREMELY LOW INCOME CATEGORY THAT CHRONICALLY HOMELESS. I THINK IT GETS AWFULLY TOUGH. TO WORK TO KEEP THEM IN UNITS WITH OUT FULL SUPPORT OF SERVICES AND MAYBE THAT'S IT YOU KNOW IN IMPLEMENTATION. BY I WOULD. I DEFINITELY THINK THAT. LOOKING AT LOCAL GOVERNMENT GIVING THEM THE MOST FLEXIBILITY AND MAYBE SOME OF THE FUNDING THAT THEY GET CAN BE USED WE HAD WHEN I WENT CITY I WORKED FOR HAD A. EMERGENCY GRANT PROGRAM FOR ONE FOR ONE MONTH RIGHT SO IF ONE MONTH. BRENT AND THERE HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE AWAY FROM ONE PAYCHECK FROM BECOMING HOMELESS RIGHT. IT IN THIS MARKET RIGHT NOW SO MAYBE THAT'S A PROGRAM THAT COULD BE FUNDED BUT IT'S STILL NOT GOING TO CURE THE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS THE NEEDY OF THE NEEDY BUT MAYBE IT STOP SO. WE DID THE POINT A TIME COUNT IN ORANGE COUNTY WE HAD. COME UP WITH AROUND FIVE THOUSAND HALF OF THOSE FOLKS WERE FOLKS THAT WERE HOMELESS BECAUSE THEY RECENTLY LOST A JOB. THEY HAD A FAMILY TRAGEDY EVENT SOMEBODY GOT SICK OR THERE WAS ON A MARRIAGE THAT SPLIT UP SO SOMEBODY WAS HOMELESS. THOSE ARE FOLKS THAT SHOULD BE HOUSED IN POTENTIALLY LIKE IT OUR TRADITIONAL TAX CREDIT PROJECT THEY'RE NOT THE MOST DIFFICULT PEOPLE SO THEN THEN YOU ARE LEFT WITH THE OTHER HALF. THAT ARE GONNA BE YEAR MORE INTENSE THAT. AGAIN NEED THE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING THE WRAPAROUND SERVICES ON SITE EXACTLY DAYS TALKING ABOUT AND WE'VE GOT A COMMITMENT ACTUALLY FROM OUR. LARGE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM DOWN SOUTH TO PROVIDE SERVICES ON SITE THEY BELIEVE THERE'S ENOUGH BILL BACK PROGRAMS TO COVER THOSE SERVICES. THAT WE'RE NOT UNDERWRITING IT IN OUR PERFORMING IN OUR OPERATING STANDARD SO YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THERE'S ONE SILVER BULLET BUT I THINK IF YOU CAN. I'M PUT ANY PROGRAM INTO PLACE TO PREVENT. I'M HOMELESSNESS THE EVICTIONS AND WE'VE ALL NOW I'M SURE READ THAT A CONVICTED AND YOU READ ABOUT WHAT IT DOES TO FAMILIES AND KIDS AND. IT'S OF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT CAN BE PUT IN PLACE THERE FOR THOSE FOR FOR EXAMPLE LIKE HALF OF THOSE FAMILIES WHO SO THEY NEVER END UP GETTING INFECTED OR AND I'M ON THE STREET BUT THEN THE OTHER HALF. I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO BE LOOKING AT PRODUCTION. AND PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. GREAT WELL I I'LL NOTICE I THINK A NUMBER COLLEAGUES KNOW. ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE WE A NUMBER OF BILLS. TO TRY TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THE EVICTION ANTENNA CRISIS BUT. THAT THE THAT THE CHALLENGE FACING. HOMELESS CALIFORNIANS IS ONE WERE ALL GRAPPLING WITH A SINNER DEL THAT IT TO THE FOR THAT A NUMBER OF US ARE SUPPORTIVE OF A SIGNIFICANT PORTION. OF THIS YEAR'S BUDGET SURPLUS GOING TO HOMELESSNESS BUT THEN THE QUESTION IS WHAT WE GONNA SPENT ON ONE FOR ONE FINAL QUESTION ON A LEAF. MISTER BROWN OUT OF THE CONVERSATION OF I HAVE I THINK ANECDOTALLY A SENSE OF SOME OF THE DIFFERENCES AND SIMILARITIES BETWEEN URBAN. AND RURAL HOMELESSNESS TO COULD YOU ADDRESS FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE WHAT YOU SEE POTENTIALLY DIFFERENCES THAT WE NEED TO BE SENSITIVE TO AS POLICY MAKERS. AND AND HOW WE OUGHT TO THINK ABOUT TAYLOR DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS. IN MORE RURAL COMMUNITY. YEAH I MEAN I THINK OUR ROLE COMMUNITIES A DOES LOOK GOOD LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. AND REGARDING THEIR DISSIDENT FRIEND DEMOGRAPHICS AND STUFF THAT WE SEE. YOU KNOW AND. SO FIRST FIRST SPECIFICALLY FOR OUR COUNTY. YOU KNOW IT'S HAVING THE ABILITY TO HAVE. WIDE REACHING SCOPE OF SERVICES TO THESE INDIVIDUALS I'M THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY. I'M RAISING AWARENESS EVEN ABOUT HOUSING PROGRAMS I'M. FOR A YOU KNOW HAD THROUGH THE MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONS I'M HAVING WITH DIFFERENT MEMBERS FROM OUR COUNTY. SPECIFICALLY YOU KNOW THEY THEY DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND EVEN A LOT ABOUT HOW THESE PROGRAMS OPERATE OR HOW THEY EVEN WORK. YOU KNOW SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE WORKING WITH. WITHIN OUR COUNTY TO CREATE MULTIPLE ACCESS POINTS THROUGHOUT THE DIFFERENT CITIES. WITH DIFFERENT CHURCHES SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS WHO MAY BE. THIS TO BE ACCESSING YES YOU DOLLARS HERE WHO MAY BE ON THE VERGE OF BEING EVICTED CAN ACCESS SOME OF THOSE DOLLARS. I'M WHO ARE MAYBE HOMELESS LIVING IN SOMEONE'S GARAGE JR SOMEWHERE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY AB PLACE THAT THEY KNOW THEY CAN GO TO TO RECEIVE EAT YES TWO DOLLARS. NOW THAT THE HOUSING COSTS PACIFIC LIKE OUR COUNTY IS AND HAS EXPENSIVE. SO EVEN THOUGH WE DO HAVE A SH. OBVIOUSLY HOUSING SHORTAGE. ESP DOLLARS FOR OUR COMMUNITY. AT FIRST SPECIFICALLY FOR CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS ACTUALLY CAN BE UTILIZED TO. MAYBE FOR RAPIDLY HOUSING DOLLARS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LESS VULNERABLE TO GET THEM OFF THE STREETS. WHICH THEN IT COMES BACK TO THE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS SITUATION THAT WE SEE. SO. WE FEEL THAT YOU KNOW AS WE LOOK TO BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT. WITHIN THE NEXT THREE TO FIVE YEARS. WE FILL HELPFUL AND THAT THERE WILL BE MORE HOUSING AVAILABLE. FOR FAMILIES IN RURAL COMMUNITIES TO ACCESS SO THAT THERE ARE YOU KNOW WHETHER DOUBLING DOUBLING UPPER. BASS AND IF I HOUSES WERE SLEEPING IN CARS AND VEHICLE SO THEY WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR HOUSING. WHERE IT'LL BE AFFORDABLE THE RAPIDLY HOUSING DOLLARS WILL BE ABLE TO AND BENEFIT THE MARIA SHE DOLLARS? SO YOU KNOW SPECIFIC FOR OUR COUNTY WE DO FEEL LIKE NEXT FIVE YEARS BECAUSE THE CITY HAS A PLAN TO BUILD A HUNDRED AND THIRTY UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. FOR FAMILY IS TIED IN WITH TWENTY UNITS OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. BUT THE PLANT THAT WILL HAPPEN FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS SO IT'S KIND LIKE WHAT WE DO AN INTERIM. Y. WERE TRYING TO SOFTEN THIS ISSUE. SO RURAL ONLY RECRUITING ACCESS POINTS FOR PEOPLE CAN ACCESS THE. THE. YES ST AHLERS I OF HIS THINK IN LUKE THAT THOUGH THOUGH. SARA CAO SKIS BILL THOUGH ASSESSABLE DWELLING UNITS MAYBE THAT MIGHT BE. EXCESS REDRAWING NO IDEA MIGHT BE. A FIT FOR RURAL AREAS WHERE THERE'S MORE. SPREAD OUT. HOUSING AND YOU KNOW THEY COULD BUILD A FEW ASSESS RECALLING UNITS IN THE. THAT MIGHT HELP. THAT MIGHT THAT MIGHT BE AN IDEA. YEAH I'M A LOOK AT THAT FIRST WE HAVE ONE SHELTER REALLY FOR THE WHOLE COUNTY INSISTS MONTH LOS BANOS ACCESSING AND THEY'RE NOT GONNA DRIVE. YEAH. TO BE SHELTERED. FOR AN HOUR AND HER SPACE LOOKING TO BUILD DIFFERENT DEVELOPMENTS SMALLER DEVELOPMENTS IN MORE RURAL COMMUNITIES WOULD BE DEATHLY HELPFUL. OKAY WE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A CERTAIN PERSONALITY OF ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. GREAT OKAY. WHEN WE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR FEEDBACK OBVIOUS AN ONGOING CONVERSATION. LET'S MOVE TO OUR FINAL PANEL TODAY. ONE OF FIGHT UP. KEVIN WILSON AND MIRIAM SUCK AND JUST TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT. ARE WE VAST. MISTER WILSON TO DISCUSS THE IMPACT OF. THE RECENTLY ENACTED FEDERAL TAX PLAN. THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS. ALLIES IN CONGRESS PASSED OUR AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE FOUR WIVES AND TAX CREDITS. AND THEN WE HAVE ALSO INVITED OUT MS UC TO PROVIDE SOME THOUGHTS ON. WHAT THE STATE CAN CONSIDER WITH REGARDS TO? LAND USE AND. RELATED IDEA SO WITH THAT. FEDERAL TAX REFORM. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME THIS IS A. A BIG HONOR FOR ME TO BE HERE TO TALK TO YOU GUYS ABOUT. HOW SOME OF THE IMPACT THAT THE RECENTLY ENACTED FEDERAL TAX BILL? WILL HAVE ON THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING INDUSTRY. COULD YOU TALK A LITTLE CLOSER TO MICROPHONE. PERFECT GOOD. SO I THINK ARE ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES. REGARDING THE IMPACT OF. FEDERAL TAX REFORM ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IS THAT WHILE THE TAX BILL. RETAINED THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS. AND THE PRIVATE ACTIVITY BONDS. WERE EXPECTING TO SEE A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION. IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION AND PRESERVATION AS A RESULT OF THE TAX BILL. I THIS IS PRIMARILY. A FUNCTION OF THE DECREASE IN THE. IN THE CORPORATE TAX RATE. SO THE REDUCTION OF THE CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM. THIRTY FIVE PERCENT TO TWENTY ONE PERCENT. WILL REDUCE THE TAX LOSS. BENEFITS OF THESE TAX CREDIT INVESTMENTS. SINCE THE VALUE OF THE DEPRECIATION EXPENSE DEDUCTIONS. WILL BE REDUCED. SO WHILE THE CHANGE IN THE TAX RATE DOES NOT AFFECT THE VALUE OF THE TAX CREDITS THEMSELVES. THE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS THAT ARE BUILT INTO THE INVESTORS PRICING. ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DIMINISHED. SO WE ARE CONDUCTING A STUDY. THAT SUGGESTED JUST THE MERE ANTICIPATION OF TAX REFORM DURING TWENTY SEVENTEEN. HOW REDUCED AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION BY ELEVEN PERCENT? IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN FOLLOWING THE TWENTY SIXTEEN ELECTION. THIS ESTIMATED ELEVEN PERCENT DECREASE. IS BASED ON A REDUCTION. PROJECTED REDUCTION OF THE CORPORATE TAX RATE. FROM THIRTY FIVE PERCENT. TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. WITH TWENTY FIVE PERCENT BEING THE. WIDELY ADOPTED UNDERWRITING ASSUMPTION THAT WAS USED DURING TWENTY SEVENTEEN. IN ANTICIPATION OF TAX REFORM. SO NOW THAT WE KNOW THAT THE ENACTED TAX RATE IS TWENTY ONE PERCENT. WE'RE ESTIMATING AN ADDITIONAL DECLINE OF ABOUT THREE PERCENT SO THAT THE AGGREGATE DECLINE. OF AFFORDABLE. HOUSING PRODUCTION PER DOLLAR OF CREDITS. ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE REDUCTION OF THE CORPORATE TAX RATE IS ANTICIPATED TO BE AROUND FOURTEEN PERCENT. I'M SO WE WE'VE ESTIMATED. THE TAX BILL WILL REDUCE THE FUTURE SUPPLY OF RENTAL HOUSING. I BY NEARLY TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND HOMES NATIONWIDE OVER TEN YEARS. WHETHER A FEW COMPONENTS OF THE TAX BILL THAT FACTOR INTO THIS ESTIMATE. THE REDUCTION OF THE CORPORATE TAX RATE IS BY FAR THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN THIS ESTIMATE. ACCOUNTING FOR ALMOST. NINETY PERCENT OF THE TOTAL REDUCTION. THIS. SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION AND HOUSING PRODUCTION WOULD ALSO MEAN. A LOSS OF MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO THOUSAND. JOBS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF BUSINESS INCOME IN FEDERAL AND STATE. TAX REVENUE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WE'VE ALSO ESTIMATED. THE IMPACT ON EACH STATE. AND AS AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT. CALIFORNIA IS. GOODNESS IS EXPECTED TO SUFFER THE GREATEST LOSSES. BY A WIDE MARGIN. I WE'VE ESTIMATED THAT OUT OF THAT NEARLY TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND HOMES. THAT WILL BE LOST OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. ALMOST FIFTY THOUSAND OF THESE HOMES WOULD BE CALIFORNIA HOMES. I THEN THIS IS NEARLY TWICE THE AMOUNT OF HOMES. FOR THAT THE NEXT STATE ON THE LIST. SO. I WAS GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE STATE CREDITS IN THE IMPACT OF THE STATE CREDITS. FROM AS A RESULT OF TAX REFORM. SO WITH REGARDS TO STAY CREDITS. HI IN GENERAL FUND THE NON CERTIFICATED STATE CREDITS ARE STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH THIS FEDERAL TAX RATE. THERE'S KIND OF AN INVERSE RELATIONSHIP. SUCH THAT WHEN THE FEDERAL TAX RATE WAS THIRTY FIVE PERCENT. THE STATE CREDIT PRICES. WE'RE GENERALLY IN THE IN THE SIXTY FIVE CENT RANGE. SO NOW THAT THE FEDERAL TAX RATE HAS BEEN REDUCED TO TWENTY ONE PERCENT. WE EXPECT A SEE AN INCREASE IN THE NON CERTIFICATED CREDIT PRICING. OF ROUGHLY TWENTY PERCENT. NOW CALIFORNIA'S CERTIFICATED CREDIT PROGRAM. PROVIDES A NUMBER OF BENEFITS INCLUDING A MECHANISM THAT SEVERS THIS CONNECTION BETWEEN THE CREDIT PRICES. AND FEDERAL TAX RATES THAT CAN. SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE CREDIT PRICES FOR THE DEVELOPERS THAT ELECT THEIR CERTIFICATED CREDITS. I WOULD EXPECT THAT THE CERTIFICATED CREDIT SHOULD STILL PRICE HIGHER THAN THE NON CERTIFICATED CREDITS. BUT AS A RESULT OF TAX REFORM. THIS. PRICING DIFFERENTIAL WILL PROBABLY SHRINK A LITTLE BIT. SO. S.. AS MANY OF U. KNOW HOW THE HOUSING CREDIT IS WIDELY REGARDED. AS ONE OF THE NATION'S MOST SUCCESSFUL TOOLS FOR ENCOURAGING PRIVATE INVESTMENT. IN AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOUSING. FINANCING OVER THREE MILLION APARTMENTS NATIONWIDE FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX. THROUGH TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND OVER TEN PERCENT OF THOSE HOMES ARE IN CALIFORNIA. DIMINISHING ITS EFFECTIVENESS WILL INVARIABLY PUT PRESSURE ON OTHER PROGRAMS AND FUNDING SOURCES. SO IT'S ENCOURAGING TO SEE ALL THE NEW FUNDING SOURCES COMING ONLINE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IN DC ADVOCATES ARE ACTIVELY PURSUING MEASURES TO MITIGATE THESE RECENT LOSSES BY EXPANDING. AND IMPROVING THE CREDIT PROGRAM. SUCH EFFORTS HAVE BEEN UNDER WAY SINCE BEFORE THE TWENTY SIXTEEN ELECTION. PERHAPS MOST NOTABLY THROUGH THE WELL KNOWN CAN'T WELL HATCH BILL. I AND ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS SENATOR WIDENS MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT BILL. EARLIER THIS MONTH THERE WASN'T A SERIOUS EFFORT. TO INCLUDE PROVISIONS OF THE CAN'T WELL HATCH BELL. IN THE TWO YEAR FEDERAL BUDGET AGREEMENT. SO WHILE THESE EFFORTS FELL SHORT. WE STILL LOOK AT THIS IS AN ENCOURAGING SIGN. AS WE HAVE NEVER BEEN CLOSER TO GETTING SOME OF THE CAN'T WELL HATCH PROVISIONS. AND ACTED INTO LAW. THE BILL CURRENTLY HAS TWENTY THREE CO SPONSORS IN THE SENATE THIRTEEN DEMOCRATS AND TEN REPUBLICANS. AS WELL AS A HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR CO SPONSORS IN THE HOUSE ROUGHLY A QUARTER OF THE HOUSE. SPLIT EVENLY WITH A SIXTY TWO DEMOCRATS AND SIXTY TWO REPUBLICANS. ADVOCATES ARE WORKING TO ENSURE THAT THIS BILL IS WELL POSITIONED. TO BE ADDED TO ANY POTENTIAL TAX LEGISLATIVE VEHICLE. THE CONGRESS COULD CONSIDER THIS YEAR. THE NEXT OPPORTUNITY WILL MOST LIKELY BE A SPENDING BILL. SLATED FOR BEFORE MARCH TWENTY THIRD. I THINK. I OUT I JUST WANNA POINT OUT THAT I THINK THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ASPECT OF THIS CAN'T WELL HATCH BILL. IS THAT. IS THE FIFTY PERCENT INCREASE AN ANNUAL AUTHORITY FOR HOUSING CREDITS. AND INCREASING THE PER CAPITA ALLOCATION AMOUNT WILL HELP MITIGATE THE LOSSES RESULTING FROM TAX REFORM. HOW WE ESTIMATE THAT THE FIFTY PERCENT INCREASE COULD ADD? OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AFFORDABLE RENTAL UNITS. NATIONWIDE OVER TEN YEARS. I ALSO WANTED TO NOTE THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION RECENTLY LA AND RECENTLY RELEASED THEIR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET REQUESTS. AS ANTICIPATED IT'S NOT GOOD NEWS FOR THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING INDUSTRY OR COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. HOW THE PLAN SEEKS TO CUT HIDE FUNDING BY ALMOST FIFTEEN PERCENT? WITH CUTS TO A VARIETY OF OTHER PROGRAMS. AND A PROPOSED ELIMINATION OF CD BG AND HOME. FOR A NUMBER OF REASON. THE THIS BUDGET ISN'T UNLIKELY TO ADVANCE. INSTEAD CONGRESS WILL NOW FOCUS ON COMPLETING THE FISCAL YEAR TWENTY EIGHTEEN APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS. WITH THE GOAL OF AN ACTING AN OMNIBUS BILL. BEFORE THE CONTINUING RESOLUTION FUNDING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EXPIRES. ON MARCH TWENTY THIRD. CENTER HELD. YOU KNOW I'M. I WAS SO FOCUSED ON AND THE SALT ISSUE AND THE MORTGAGE DEDUCTION ISSUE ASSOCIATE WITH A TAX PLAN THAT I CONFESS I'M. A LITTLE HAZY ABOUT. THIS AREA OF THE TAX PLAN AND I WOULD LOVE IT IF YOU JUST GAVE A LAYMAN'S. DESCRIPTION OF HOW. THE. TAX CREDIT USED TO WORK AND HOW IT'S BEEN CHANGED BY THE FEDERAL TAX PLAN. SO THE TAX CREDIT ITSELF WAS NOT CHANGED IT WAS LEFT IN THE CODE THE SAME CODE SECTION NO CHANGES TO THAT CODE SECTION. ANOTHER COUNTERPART SO THERE'S TWO NOTICED TWO CREDITS THERE'S A NINE PERCENT CREDIT. AND A FOUR PERCENT CREDIT FOR PERCENT CREDIT IS ALWAYS PAIRED WITH PRIVATE ACTIVITY BONDS. THE PRIVATE ACTIVITY BONDS WERE WERE VERY CLOSE TO BEING ELIMINATED THROUGH TAX REFORM BUT THEY ENDED UP. STAYING IN. IN THE TAX CODE AS WELL SO TAX CREDITS PRIVATE ACTIVITY BONDS STATE IN THE CODE. AT THE BIGGEST IMPACT THOUGH IS THAT. THE TAX RATES THE FOR THE CORPORATE TAX RATE GOING FROM THIRTY FIVE PERCENT TO TWENTY ONE PERCENT. IT'S GOING TO REDUCE THE INVESTORS WERE TURNED ON THEIR TAX CREDIT INVESTMENTS AND AS A RESULT THERE WILL BE LESS EQUITY SO I HAVE HAD A CHART HERE THAT SHOW THAT THERE WOULD BE. THE VALUE. A HEARD THE PRICES ARE PRESENT PRICES THAT INVESTORS ARE WILLING TO PAY FOR THE RIGHTS HAS ROBBED. EXACTLY BY. ROUGHLY FIFTEEN PERCENT SO EVERY TAX CREDIT DEFAULT THE IT IS FURTHER AFFORDABLE HOUSING TAX CREDIT BUT I'M SEEING IT. DID YOU THE SAME LOGIC APPLIES TO NEARLY EVERY TAX CREDIT IN THE CODE. THAT CORPORATIONS ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF. NO NO I THINK EACH ONE OF US IS GOING TO HAVE ITS OWN DYNAMICS. SO WHAT'S SPECIAL ABOUT THIS ONE IN THAT SENSE VERSES ANOTHER TAX CREDIT. VERSUS LIKE SAY THAT THE NEW MARKETS TAX CREDIT OR. OR ANY OTHER TIME SOME MANY NOT ME NINE HOUSING REALLY TAX CREDIT. MOON. SO I GET LIKE FOR EXAMPLE. THE NEW MARKETS TAX CREDIT. SERVER SOME ARE INDEED TAX CREDIT OR SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES OKAY. SO I MEET EACH ONE OF THOSE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THIS IS THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TAX CREDITS TO CHART THAT I'M SHOWING HERE. IT'S SHOWING THAT THE CREDIT PRICES. ARE MORE THAN A DOLLAR PER CREDIT THAT'S A CREDIT THAT'S BEING. EARNED BY THAT INVESTOR OVER TEN YEAR PERIOD RECENT THEY'RE PAYING MORE THAN THAT DOLLARS FOR THE CREDIT NOW. IS A BEGINNING ADDITIONAL BENEFITS AS A RESULT OF THEIR INVESTMENT. IN THE PRIMARY. ADDITIONAL BENEFIT THAT THESE INVESTORS ARE GETTING. S. I IS TAX LOSSES FROM THE DEPRECIATION OF THE BUILDING. AND THOSE TAX LOSSES. HAVE A LOWER VALUE AS A RESULT OF THAT THE CORPORATE TAX RATE RIGHT NOW OTHER TAX CREDITS. WILL HAVE DIFFERENT PRICING MECHANISMS BECAUSE ARE BEING AWARDED TO THE INVESTORS OVER DIFFERENT PERIOD OF TIME. IT'S IT'S VERY HARD TO CORRELATE THE TWO. SWAT WHERE IS THIS GONNA DO IT WOULD SO SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THE BILL. WELL THIS IS ACTUALLY SHOWING SHOWS A STEEP DROP RIGHT AFTER THE ELECTION. IN ANTICIPATION OF TAX REFORM RIGHT. SO THAT ROB IS. GEN JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTEEN YEAH YEAH THERE WAS A SHARP DROP BECAUSE RIGHT AFTER THE ELECTION EVERYONE STARTED TO REALIZE THAT THERE IS A STRONG LIKELIHOOD THAT TAX REFORM WOULD BE ENACTED INTO WHERE IS IT. WHERE THE JANUARY AND FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN MEMBERS ARE WE NOT KNOW YET? NO NO THIS IS KIND OF IT'S KIND A THREE MONTH ROLLING AVERAGE SO WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA YET. BUT IS IT DROP FURTHER. BICU I I THINK WE'RE KIND OF SEEM TO DROP RIGHT THERE IN DECEMBER. I THINK I THINK YOU KNOW WE WOULD LIKE US AND THEY WERE USING A TWENTY FIVE PERCENT RATE FOR UNDERWRITING IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN NOW NOW IT'S GONE DOWN TO TWENTY ONE PERCENT. SO I THINK WE'RE SEEING THAT DROPPED SORT OF AT THE END OF THAT CHART THERE. AND SO THIS IS SO THIS IS MONEY THAT USED TO. BE AN IMPORTANT DRIVER OF. OF LOW INCOME HOUSING CONSTRUCTION. CORRECT OKAY FOR CREATING THE SUPPLY RIGHT. OKAY THIS ISN'T FURTHER EXACERBATING. FACTOR THAT'S GOING TO MAKE CORRECT AN ALREADY BAD SITUATION FOR HOURS. AND THERE IS ALSO SO IT'S HARDLY WE ESTIMATED TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE UNITS. FEWER OVER TEN YEARS AS A RESULT OF THE TAX BILL OKAY AND TO MY CLASSICAL HATCH. SO THERE IS THAT THERE'S A SENATE BILL CAN'T CAN'T WILL HAVE TO THE SENATE BILL. IN DC. THAT. HAS A LONG LIST OF IMPROVEMENTS TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TAX CREDIT. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF WHICH IS RIGHT NOW THAT THE CREDITS ARE ALLOCATED TO EACH STATE PER CAPITA A CERTAIN DOLLAR AMOUNT TO DOLLARS AND. I THIRTY FIVE CENTS PER PERSON IN THE STATE. PRISON PROPOSED ONE ONE OF THE SEVERAL IMPROVEMENTS. THAT'S INCLUDED IN THIS BILL IS INCREASING THAT AMOUNT BY FIFTY PERCENT. AND SO JUST THAT FIFTY PERCENT INCREASE ALONE. COULD. COULD COUNTERACT THE REDUCTION THEY KNOW THAT TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE UNIT NATIONWIDE REDUCTION OVER TEN YEARS. JUST A FIFTY PERCENT INCREASE ALONE COULD BRING BACK ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS OVER TEN YEARS NATIONWIDE ANOTHER ASPECT OF THE THAT BILL. IS THAT YOU KNOW. THAT THE THAT FOUR PERCENT CREDIT CENTER PAIRED WITH THE TAX EXEMPT BONDS. WITH THE PRIVATE ACTIVITY BONDS. THERE THIS BILL WOULD RIGHT NOW THAT THAT CREDIT RATE SORT OF FLOATS SUGGESTS EVERY MONTH IT'S BEEN IN THE LOS THREES FOR YOU KNOW FOR A LONG TIME NOW. AYE THIS BILL WOULD FIX THAT RATE OF FOUR PERCENT. JUST MOVING THAT CREDIT RATE THAT YOU MULTIPLY THAT YOU'RE BUILDING BASIS BY TO CALCULATE THE AMOUNT OF CREDITS THE BUILDING EARNS. FOR CALCULATING WITH THAT COULD ADD. ANOTHER OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS AS WELL. SO THIS BILL WAS THE STATUS THE BILL NOW. SO. IT WAS IT WAS CLOSE THERE WAS A SERIES THERE'S A STRONG PUSH. THE THE TWO YEAR FEDERAL BUDGET AGREEMENT THAT WAS ENACTED. A TWO WEEKS AGO. THERE'S A VERY STRONG PUSH TO INCLUDE SOME OF THESE PROVISIONS IN THAT BILL. SO CAME CLOSE.% BUT. BUT THOSE EFFORTS DID NOT SUCCEED. BUT IN A SOME PEOPLE IN DC ARE WORKING VERY HARD. I TRIED TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS BILL IS WELL POSITIONED. TO. YOU KNOW. B. ADDED TO ANY TAX LEGISLATIVE VEHICLE THAT CONGRESS CONSIDERS THIS YEAR SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S ANOTHER. THAT'S ANOTHER SPENDING RESOLUTION THAT'S DO YOU KNOW WITHIN THE NEXT HOUR MONTH. SO THERE THERE'S A CHANCE THAT THAT MIGHT BE. INCLUDED AS WELL FOR EXAMPLE I KNOW THAT. THAT THE REPUBLICANS ARE EAGER TO FIX A CERTAIN GLITCH IN THE TAX CODE. AND SO THAT THAT MIGHT YOU KNOW OPEN THEM UP IN SOME OF THE REPUBLICANS WHO HAVEN'T YET SUPPORTED THE BILL ALTHOUGH I AS I MENTIONED THERE ARE NUMEROUS SPONSORS FUND BOTH SIDES. FOR THIS BILL HOT THAT I COULD OPEN IT UPSWINGS YOU KNEW WHAT WHY THEY DIDN'T INCLUDE. THE LANGUAGE IN THE LAST GO AROUND. I Y. GOT PULLED OUT YOU CITY JUST AS YOU SAID IT FELL SHORT OF THE BUDGET OF OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET YOU SAID IT FELL SHORT A COUPLE WEEKS AGO YEAH NO I DO NOT. KNOW I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT GOT NEGOTIATED OUT. SO. ANDERSON THANK YOU. IF I COULD OF LEND A LITTLE BIT OF A LAY PERSON'S. UNDERSTANDING OF OF OF THE TAX SITUATION SO A SO LAST YEAR I AM PROUD THAT OUR LEGISLATURE DID YEOMAN'S WORK TO PASS TO SIGNIFICANT REVENUE MEASURES. AS YOU KNOW S. B. TWO IS GOING TO BE ABOUT A QUARTER BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. ARE S. B. THREE WITH OUR CENTER BELL. WILL ADD TO THAT TO THE TUNE OF COMBINED BETWEEN SP TWO SP THREE ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. THAT COMPARES TO THE ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THAT WE USE TO INVEST IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING. FOR THE GREAT RECESSION SO WERE TRYING TO GET OUR WAY HALFWAY UP. BECAUSE OF THE TRUMP TAX CUTS WE ARE LOSING AS A STATE HALF A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FINANCING SO ANOTHER WORDS IF CENTER REBELS BOND IS NOT PASSES NOVEMBER THROUGH THIS TAX CUT. IS CENTER BILLS A MEASURE DOES NOT PASS THIS NOVEMBER HEAVEN FORBID IF IT DOESN'T PASS. THE THE AND WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY HAPPEN IS WE TOOK ONE STEP FORWARD AND DONALD TRUMP AS ALLIES TOOK US TWO STEPS BACK. IF WE DO PASS THE MEASURE IN NOVEMBER WE TAKE TWO STEPS FORWARD AND DONALD TRUMP'S TAX CUTS TAKE US ONE STEP BACK SO WE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY HURT BY WHAT HAPPENED. WITH. THE TAX CUTS WHEN IT IS IN THE FORM IN THE FOR HOUSING ARENA. AND THAT'S A VERY REAL IMPACT ON ANYONE IS TRY TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THAT'S RIGHT. ANY OTHER. COMMENTS I CANNOT I WANT I WANT TO GO TO THE NEXT PRESENTATION. YEAH YOU I KNOW YOU AS OUR DEEP DEEP DEEP IN THE WEEDS OF. HOUSING FINANCE I JUST APPRECIATE THAT DECLARED SURE. IF WE GO TO THE NEXT PRESENTATION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. GREAT SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH I MY NAME IS MARION SUCK I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR COMMUNICATION AND URBAN DISPLACEMENT PROJECT. I THINK YOU VERY MUCH FOR. INVITING ME TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY ABOUT THE NEED TO ADDRESS DISPLACEMENT TODAY. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO AREN'T FAMILIAR WITH OUR OUR CENTER WE AYE CONDUCT IN RESEARCH ON HOUSING TRANSPORTATION AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TO ADVANCE EQUITABLE AND RESILIENT FUTURES WITH COMMUNITIES. OUR WORK IS IT IS ARRANGED AROUND THE THREE MAIN PROJECTS AT THE BOTTOM AND THE ONE I'LL BE SPEAKING TO YOU MOST TODAY IS OUR URBAN DISPLACEMENT PROJECT. I WHICH SEEKS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE DRIVERS OF DISPLACEMENT AND WORK WITH COMMUNITIES TO DESIGN EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS. SO I'M NOT GOING TO ON THE DATA THAT YOU ALL KNOW VERY VERY WELL BUT JUST REGARDING REGARDLESS TO SAY THAT. AT THE BUT THE. BOTTOM ROW HERE SHOWS YOU THE AVERAGE ANNUAL INCOME YOU NEED TO MAKE TO AFFORD RENT FOR YOUR AVERAGE TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IF YOU'RE A TWO WORKER HOUSEHOLD MAKING MINIMUM WAGE EACH OF YOU NEED TO BE WORKING ELEVEN HOURS A DAY. TWO. TO AFFORD RENT AND THAT TIME AWAY FROM YOUR FAMILY. BUT THIS IS SOME DATA FROM FROM. H. CD THAT SHOWS THAT WHILE ALL OF US OR FEELING THE CRUNCH OF THIS. TERRIBLE HOUSING CRISIS UP IT'S REALLY OUR OUR LOW INCOME AN EXTREMELY LOW INCOME AS WE WERE HEARD ABOUT TODAY. THAT ARE MOST SEVERELY BURDEN SO HERE ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE YOU CAN SEE IN BLUE SEVERELY RENT BURDENS THAT'S ME THAT'S SPENDING MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF YOUR INCOME ON RENT. A INNING GREEN IS A RENT BURDEN THIS IS THIRTY PERCENT OF YOUR INCOME ON RENT AND AS YOU CAN SEE. THE HIGHER YOUR INCOME THE LESS BIRD AND YOU ARE TO. THEN WHAT WE KNOW ALSO IS THAT IF YOU TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION ARE HOUSING COSTS ARE STATE POVERTY LEVELS RATES JUMPED FROM SIXTEEN TO TWENTY ONE PERCENT. UP WHICH IS CLEARLY CONTRIBUTING TO THE FACT THAT NEARLY A QUARTER OF OUR STATE'S CHILDREN ARE GROWING UP IN POP. ALL OF THIS WHICH WE ALL KNOW VERY WELL AS PART PERSONALLY I CREATED BY THE UNDERSUPPLY. OF OF HOUSING. BUT ALL OF THIS IS CONTRIBUTING TO MASK DISPLACEMENT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE SEEN THE DATA THAT CAME OUT TODAY FROM THE LA O'BRIEN YOU LAWYERS ANALYSIS OF IRS DATA. BUT HE SHOWED IN THIS DATA SET. THAT WE ARE SEEING A MASS OUT MIGRATION OF LOW AND MODERATE INCOME RESIDENTS FROM CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE STATE. A AND THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT CAN AFFORD TO MOVE HERE ARE VERY HIGH INCOME AND VERY HIGH KITTY PEOPLE. HERE'S SOME DATA FOR THE BAY AREA WHICH I KNOW VERY WELL. WITH WHICH WE CAN SEE HERE IS THAT BECAUSE OF. SOME HERE THAT CAME OUT FROM READ FAN IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. THAT ONE IN FOUR PEOPLE LOOKING FOR HOMES IN CALIFORNIA LOOKED OUTSIDE OF THE STATE. A BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE BAY AREA LOST TWENTY TWO THOUSAND AFRICAN AMERICAN RESIDENTS. AND THREE QUARTERS OF THOSE WHO HAVE LAUGHED SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN MAKE LESS THAN FIFTY THOUSAND SO IT'S IMPACTING US ALL BUT WE KNOW IT'S IMPACTING OUR MOST VULNERABLE THE MOST. THE CASE IS A GOOD QUESTION SITE THEN THE LAST SLIDE YEAH WHAT. I MEAN WHAT WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE CALIFORNIA POPULATION MAKES LESS THAN FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY. I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER FOR YOU RIGHT NOW OKAY. OKAY GUYS IF. I'M GONNA GET A SENSE OF THAT'S. CORRELATED WITH THE GENERAL POPULATION OR IF IT'S PARTICULARLY BURDENED. WAIT IF DEMOCRATIC EVALUATE THAT THAT THE ASSERTION YOU'RE MAKING AND. IN THAT SENSE IT'S I I THOUGHT THAT THE MEANING OF SENATE THIRTY EIGHT OUT WITH FORTY THOUSAND. NOW THAT I DON'T HAVE IT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. IT MIGHT BE REPRESENTATIVE BUT AGAIN THIS IS JUST KIND OF REFLECTIVE OF WHO'S MOVING OUT IN HIS MOVING IN. SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT GEOGRAPHY WHICH WE THINK ABOUT A LOT. AND AT THIS IS A MAP. A COPY OF THE MAP THAT OF OUR DISPLACEMENT RISK MAP WHICH WE'VE JUST RECENTLY REALLY EXPANDED OUT TO SACRAMENTO AND DOWN TO SAN ACT SANTA CRUZ. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE THIS ARE DISTRIBUTION OF WHERE THIS IS OCCURRING WHERE THE RISK OF DISPLACEMENT IS CURRYING. WE SEE THAT OVER SIXTY PERCENT OF LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ACROSS THE BAY AREA ARE LIVING IN NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE AT RISK OF OUR ALREADY UNDERGOING DISPLACEMENT. THAT'S ROUGHLY UP TEN PERCENT IN THE LAST TWO YEARS SINCE OUR PREVIOUS ANALYSIS SO WE KNOW THAT THIS CRISIS IS ACCELERATING. AND AS WE HEARD EARLIER AND WE KNOW PRETTY WELL AT THIS POINT THE THE. DISPLACEMENT CRISIS HAS SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON CHILDREN WORKERS FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. A THIS IS A RESEARCH BRIEF WE CAME OUT WITH LAST YEAR FROM A SURVEY WE DID OF ACTED HOUSEHOLDS INS FROM SAN MATEO COUNTY. WE'RE NOT RIGHT NOW IN THE PROCESS OF REPLICATING THE SURVEY FOR SANTA CLARA COUNTY. ON IN WHAT WE FOUND A IN THIS SURVEY IS THAT DISPLACEMENT IS INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH OUR HOUSING UP OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. WHEN IN THREE DISPLACE HOUSEHOLDS REPORTED SOME PERIOD OF HOMELESSNESS OR MARTIAL HOUSING IN THE TWO YEARS FOLLOWING THEIR AFFECTIONS ARE DISPLACEMENT. THIRTY THREE PERCENT OF THOSE HOUSEHOLDS THAT WERE DIS PLACE LEFT THE COUNTY UP ALTHOUGH SO THAT SAYING THAT THE MAJORITY STAY IN THE COUNTY BECAUSE THEY OFTEN ARE DOUBLING UP THERE ARE LIVING IN SOME SORT OF MARGINAL HOUSING WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS OR. ON COUCHES. BUT THOSE THAT LEFT UP LEFT THE COUNTY ALTOGETHER ON IN THOSE THAT WERE DISPLACED OUT OF THE COUNTY AND. IN THE PAST MAJORITY OF THEM ARE JUST PLACE TO WORSE OFF NEIGHBORHOODS AND THIS IS VALIDATING SOME RESEARCH THAT CAME OUT OF PHILADELPHIA LAST YEAR I BELIEVE. THAT SHOWED THAT DISPLAYS HOUSEHOLDS MOVED TO LOWER LOWER OPPORTUNITY AREAS. SO AS YOU ALL KNOW THERE'S NO QUESTION WHERE THE SEVERE HOUSING COURT SHORTAGE AND NEW SUPPLIES CRITIC CRITICAL DUE TO ALL OF YOUR HARD WORK AYE WE'VE MADE AMAZING PROGRESS AT AND VIA YOU KNOW. ACCELERATING THE PRODUCTION OF HOUSING. BUT THE QUESTION REALLY IS WHAT ARE WE DOING TO PREVENT DISPLACEMENT AND AND SLOW THE TIED RIGHT NOW TODAY. A COUPLE YEARS AGO WE DID WE PUT OUT THIS RESEARCH BRIEF THAT LOOKED AT MERCURY HOUSING PRODUCTION. AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND ITS IMPACTS ON HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AS WELL AS A DISPLACEMENT RATES AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT. ALTHOUGH THE PRODUCTION OF MERCURY HOUSING IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES LEAD TO LOWER MEDIAN RENTS IN FOR THE FIFTH FIFTEEN YEARS LATER. THE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY LEVELS THE HOUSING BURDEN FOR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS INCREASED IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS SO WHAT BASICALLY WHAT THIS IS SAYING IS THAT. YOU WHEN WE PRODUCE A FULL MARKET RATE HOUSING IT IS NOT INCREASING THE AFFORDABILITY LEVELS OF LOW INCOME WRATH TENANTS. SO I THINK YOU KNOW BASICALLY DRIVING HOME THIS THIS QUESTION WHAT WE HEARD EARLIER BUILDING MARKET RATE HOUSING IS NOT GONNA SOLVE THE HOW THE HOUSING CRISIS IN THE AFFORDABILITY CRISIS FOR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS WE NEED IT NO QUESTION WE NEED IT. BUT IS NOT THE SOLUTION FOR THE THAT LOW END OF THE SCALE. WHAT WE ALSO FOUND IS THAT WHILE AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL PRODUCING HOUSING ALTOGETHER FOR BOTH SUBSIDIZE IN MARKET RATE A REDUCE DISPLACEMENT PRESSURES? EIGHT BIT THE PRODUCTION OF SUBSIDIZED AFFORDABLE HOUSING HAD TWICE THE IMPACT OF MARKET RATE HOUSING. SO BY ALL MEANS AND WE ALL KNOW AND YOU'LL KNOW VERY WELL WE NEED TO BE PRODUCING MORE MARKET RATE HOUSING BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST OUR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS THAT LIVE IN THE STATE OR THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT. BUT IF WE DO SO WE NEED TO ANY FOR FOCUSED ON THAT WE NEED TO BE MAKING SURE THAT WERE LINKING PRODUCTION TO PRETTY ACTIONS WHERE WHERE THE MARKET WANTS TO PRODUCE NEW HOUSING. IS WHERE RENTS ARE GROWING WHERE THEY CAN MAKE PROFIT AND SO WE NEED TO BE PROTECTING TENANTS IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS WE CAN'T DEVELOP MORE AND THAT'S GOING TO HELP THE PEOPLE LIVING THERE NOW BECAUSE THE LOW INCOME PEOPLE LIVING THERE NOW ARE NOT GONNA BE HELPED BY THAT MARKET RATE HOUSING SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE HELPING THEM WHILE ALSO PRODUCING MARKET RATE HOUSING. WE NEED TO BE REQUIRED AFFORDABILITY BUT OBVIOUSLY WITHOUT HINDERING DEVELOPMENT AND THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT WORK I ALSO TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN THE CASA. GROUP WORKING GROUP IN THE BAY AREA THEY'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF GREAT WORK ON THIS AND HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU RATE SIZE AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS OR NOT KILLING TWO ALLOTMENT. LET'S MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT AYE YOU NOTE. REMOVING AFFORDABLE UNITS FROM FROM A. FROM OUR MARKET. WHILE AT THE SAME TIME PRODUCING MARKET RATE UNITS. THINK THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT WORK COMING OUT OF LOS ANGELES ON NO NET LOSS POLICIES AND LANGUAGE. A AND THEN FINALLY I HOPE YOU ARE FOR ON THIS TOPIC. IF WE WANT TO BE CREATING INCLUSIVE AND DIVERSE COMMUNITIES. WE REALLY NEED TO BE PAYING ATTENTION TO LOCAL CONTEXTS IN HIS PAST HISTORY TO BE ABLE TO A HOT CREATE FAIR HOUSING IN OUR COMMUNITIES. SO GETTING BACK TO. WHAT I THINK WE NEED TO BE FOCUSING ON IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WHICH IS REALLY TENURE PROTECTIONS? WHAT WE KNOW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS THAT TENER PROTECTIONS ARE THE BY FAR THE EXCEPTION NOT THE RULE IN OUR COMMUNITIES? ONLY. ONLY TWELVE CALIFORNIA CITIES HAVE SOME FOR IMMIGRANTS TO LOOK STABILIZATION IN ONLY SEVENTEEN COMMUNITIES HAVE. JUST CAUSE FOR ADDICTS PREDICTIONS PROTECTIONS THAT MEANS EVERYWHERE ELSE WHICH IS THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR COMMUNITIES. THERE ARE PROTECTIONS RIGHT SO YOUR LANDLORD CAN RAISE THE RENT HOWEVER MUCH HE WANTS OR HE OR SHE WANTS. A AT ANY WELL AFTER YOUR LEASE IS UP AT ANYTIME. IN THOSE PLACES THAT DON'T HAVE RENT STABILIZATION OR THEY CONVICT YOU FOR NO REASON AT ALL THEY DON'T HAVE TO GIVE A REASON IF THEY WANT YOU OUT OF THERE UNITS. TO. SO I JUST WANNA END HERE WITH THESE PRE FIVE BIG BUS BUCKETS OF THE NET NECESSARY ACTIONS THAT I THINK WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT AND I DON'T REALLY HAVE TIME TO GO INTO DETAIL ON EACH OF THESE BUT. HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. ON THE FIRST ONE REALLY IS ABOUT SHIELDING TENANTS FROM RENT HIKE SO IN THEIR UNITS ALLOWING THEM TO STAY IN NOT BEING SURPRISED BY. YOU KNOW THE TWENTY THIRTY FIFTY DOUBLING RENTS THAT WE ARE SEEING IN SOME OF OUR HOT MARKET CITIES. UP THAT WE'RE PROTECTING TENANTS FROM UNFAIR EVICTIONS RIGHT MAKING SURE THAT THE WHOLE NAM OR HAS SOME SORT OF ACTUAL JUST BECAUSE FOR EVICTING. STRENGTHENING ANTI RETALIATION LAWS RIGHT NOW I MEAN. IT'S REALLY NOT THEY'RE NOT EFFECTIVE RATE AYE IF YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT YOUR LANDLORD. NOT FIXING YOUR SINK. WELL WE SAY BY LAW THAT THEY CAN'T RETALIATE EVICT YOU THEY REALLY CAN IT'S VERY HARD TO PROVE. AND AND CLEARLY IN SOME THE WORK I KNOW YOU ALL ARE WORKING ON IS IS CREATING REALLY REASONABLE PROCEDURES SO THAT WE HAVE MORE A FAIR SYSTEM. LET'S IMPROVE SUBSTANDARD HOUSING SO WE DON'T SEE GHOST SHIP FIRES HAPPENING. IN THAT WHEN PEOPLE DO COMPLAIN THAT YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE NOT EVICTED FROM THEIR HOMES OR THEIR NOT BEING FORCED OUT BECAUSE THEIR LANDLORD ISN'T KEEPING THEIR UNITS UP. THEY CAN SURE ACCESS TO REPRESENTATION SO RIGHT TO COUNSEL WE KNOW THAT WHEN WHEN TENANTS DON'T HAVE REPRESENTATION THEY DON'T WIN. A IN COURT. AND THEN FINALLY ABOUT PRESERVING HOUSING AFFORDABILITY SO THIS IS I KNOW THAT A LOT OF WORKS OR EVEN DONE ON PRESERVING. DEED RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE UNITS BUT REALLY THINKING ABOUT THOSE UNITS THAT ARE NOT DE RESTRICTED THAT ARE WHAT PEOPLE LIKE TO CALL NATURALLY OCCURRING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. REALLY DOING MORE TO THINK ABOUT WHERE THOSE ARE HAD WE STABILIZE THEM AND WE TAKE THEM OFF THE MARKET HOW DO WE DO A BETTER JOB UNDERSTANDING WHEN THEY'RE PART ABOUT TO GO ON SALE. SO I WILL LEAVE YOU WITH THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. JUST GOV THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. WHAT SOLUTIONS WHICH YOU HAVE TO THE? SHOOTING. TENANTS FROM RENT HIKES AND SOME OF THOSE. IDEAS YOU HAD TO PROTECT. TENANTS OUT WE DO. SO YOU MEAN BEYOND RENT STABILIZATION. YEAH AND THEN. ACCESS TO REPRESENTATION. SO I MEAN RIGHT NOW IT'S THE CITY OF NEW YORK PASSED A. TENET RIGHT TO COUNSEL LAW. I BELIEVE TWO YEARS AGO NOW. THIS ROLLING OUT RIGHT NOW. LAST YEAR A CASE THAT'S BEING ROLLED OUT RIGHT NOW. SO THAT IS PROVIDING REPRESENTATION TOO I THINK IS BELOW TWO HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE POVERTY LEVEL. SO SO NOT JUST THE LOWEST INCOME. RIGHT NOW IT'S IT'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET REPRESENTATION I MEAN THERE'S SOME IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE VERY LOW INCOME MADE YOU CAN GET REPRESENTATION BUT IT'S VERY HARD TO FIND A LAWYER. SO THIS IS CREATING A FUN AND SAN FRANCISCO'S CONSIDERING THIS NOW I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'VE ALREADY. YEAH I KNOW THE MAYOR'S OFFICE HOUSING WAS WORKING ON SOME BUDGETS FOR THAT. SO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK HAPPENING ON IT. WE KNOW THAT IT'S EFFECTIVE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. SOME WORK THAT HAPPEN THAT DOC MERELY BECAUSE SERVICES OF EAST PALO ALTO PUT OUT. I THINK THEY SAID FOR PLACES THAT DON'T HAVE TENURE PROTECTIONS RIGHT TO COUNSEL IS. HELPING ABOUT. IN GREEK DECREASING EVICTIONS OR INCREASING THE LENGTH THAT YOU CAN STAY IN YOUR APARTMENT BY ABOUT FIFTEEN PERCENT FOR PLACES THAT DO HAVE PROTECTIONS. IT'S% EFFECTIVE AT ROUTE EIGHTY PERCENT SO. IT'S REALLY HELPFUL AND NECESSARY. COME. STATE FUNDS A LOT OF THE LEGAL AID PROGRAMS IS THAT IS THAT WHERE THEY WOULD GET REPRESENTATION. RIGHT NOW YES BUT IT'S HARD TO QUALIFY AND IF YOU ARE UNDOCUMENTED YOU'D THERE'S NO RESOURCES AT ALL. OR VERY FEW. YEAH SO WE HAVE TO LOOK INTO THAT I'M ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE THAT DEALS WITH THE JUDICIARY'S. WITHOUT THAT WE LASH WE INCREASE FUNDING. I ASKED HER WHAT KOWSKI ACTUALLY. CHAPIN DOT BECAUSE SO. THAT'S HOW WE CAN LOOK AT IT. GREAT. SENATE ALLEN. I'M I JUST WANT TO ASK ABOUT IT AND THIS WHOLE CONVERSATION ABOUT. HOUSING AFFORDABILITY YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN AND. SO MEMBERS PROP FOR THE. COSTA HAWKINS REPEAL BILL. BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE. I REMEMBER THAT ONE OF THE BIG ARGUMENTS. THAT WAS MADE WAS THAT RENT STABILIZATION RENT CONTROL TETRA ACTUALLY HAS A DELETERIOUS EFFECT. ON. YOU KNOW HOUSING AFFORDABILITY BECAUSE IT. YOU SENSE THAT MARKET SIGNALS ACROSS THE BOARD IN THAT I'M OUT OF THE ARGUMENT WAS MADE. AGAINST THE BILL. YEAH CAN YOU SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TO THAT ARGUMENT AND AND SOME OF THE RESEARCH YOU'VE DONE AND. YOU'RE MAKING A VERY DIFFERENT ARGUMENT HERE TODAY. SO NOT NOT NECESSARILY ABOUT RENT STABILIZATION. SO MY UNDERSTANDING FROM THAT RESEARCH. IS IT I MEAN. SO THE ONLY RESEARCH I'VE SEEN ABOUT THAT SPECIFIC QUESTION WAS FROM SAINT THIS RECENT SAN FRANCISCO STUD STUDY OF SAN FRANCISCO FROM STANFORD. RESEARCHER. AND THAT WAS LOOKING AT THE EXPANSION OF RENT CONTROL IN THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. AND THE ARGUMENT MY UNDERSTANDING FROM MY READ OF THE REPORT WAS THAT IT INCREASED. RENTS IN THE CITY BECAUSE LANDLORDS WERE REMOVING UNITS FROM THE RENT CONTROL MARKET SO THEY WERE INCREASING CONVERSIONS TO. TEN SEASON COMMENT AND CONDO CONVERSIONS SO IN THAT CASE I WOULD SAY THE ARGUMENT THERE IS. GREAT CONTROL BECAUSE LANDLORDS DON'T DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH IT. ART YOU KNOW FOR. PROBABLY SOME OBVIOUS REASONS. THEY WERE REMOVING THEIR UNITS FROM THE RENT CONTROL MARKET I BELIEVE THIS MIGHT BE. PRIOR TO SOME OF THE CONDO CONVERSION LAWS. IN SAN FRANCISCO BUT. PROBABLY NOT IT MAY BE MORE OF AN ENFORCEMENT QUESTION. SO YOU'RE REDUCING THE SUPPLY AND THEREFORE THE RENTS ARE GOING UP. SO THE ARGUMENT WOULD BE WELL THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE IMPACT OF RENT CONTROL PER SE ON THE MARKET RATE UNITS BUT RATHER THAT PEOPLE ARE REMOVING UNITS FROM THE MARKET AND THEREFORE. WE NEED TO BE DOING A BETTER JOB ENFORCING OUR. CONDO CONVERSION OR. YOUR NOSE WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO THE ARGUMENT THAT WAS MADE WAS THAT. IT IN THE MOVIE YOU CAN SPEAK TO THIS TOO GIVEN YOUR WORK IN. THIS AREA. ON THE DEVELOPMENT SIDE. THAT THAT AND IT IMPACTS THE WILLINGNESS OF DEVELOPERS TO WANT TO ENTER INTO. YOU KNOW HOUSING. NO. IT HOUSING MARKET BECAUSE THEY LOOK AT IT IS. HURTING THEIR BOTTOM LINE IN THE LONG TERM. SO I THINK PART OF THAT AND I GUESS THIS IS PART OF THE HEART COSTA HAWKINS IN EX THE EXEMPTION OF NEW CONSTRUCTION. BUT. I MEAN THE RESEARCH THAT'S OUT THERE THERE IS LOOKED AT THE IMPACTS OF RENT STABILIZATION ON NEW HOUSING PRODUCTION HAS NOT FOUND THAT IT HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT THERE'S BEEN RESEARCH IN NEW YORK. THERE'S BEEN RESEARCH IN THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY THAT HAS LIKE OVER A HUNDRED JURISDICTIONS WITH RENT CONTROL. AND THEY HAVE NOT FOUND THAT IS HAD NEGATIVE IMPACT ON NEW A NEW HOUSING CONSTRUCTION SO. I DON'T KNOW AS FAR AS. I MEAN I COULD UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENT BUT I DON'T THINK THAT RESEARCH VALIDATES THAT ARGUMENT. GREAT THANK YOU SUMMONER. BOTH SO THAT THE TAX CREDIT UNITS HAVE FIVE RATE RESTRICTIONS THAT ARE TIED TO THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME SURE AND SO THE. IT IS THE STATE THE TEAK TEAK ACT WHEN THEY ALLOCATE THE CREDITS THEY WERE POINTS FOR THE DEVELOPERS THAT HOLD THE. IS THAT THE RESERVE UNITS FOR YOU KNOW LOWER AREA MEDIAN INCOME. PRINTED I GUESS IF YOU BELIEVE YOUR TO TAKE OFF YOUR. LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT THAT. SPECIFIC TO WHAT YOU TALKED ABOUT EARLIER IS CONTACT PROBABLY ABOUT THE IMPACT OF. MANDATORY SIMPLEST STABILIZATION POLICIES ON AFFORDABILITY GENERAL DO YOU HAVE THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT GIVEN WHAT YOU SEEM. BECAUSE THERE THERE'S OTHER JUST TWO VERY COMPETING NARRATIVES HERE IN THIS LEGISLATURE AT WILL AND. THOSE LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW IT'S A TOUGH POLICY QUESTION OF HER. GERMANY. IT'S IT'S A DIRTY ONE CHAIR IT'S OKAY IF YOU DON'T I DON'T THINK I HAVE A YOU KNOW. GOOD SOLUTION FOR. CENTER OF I JUST HAD ONE LAST QUESTION OF. WE PASSED S. B. ONE LAST YEAR'S GOING TO INCREASE TRANSPORTATION FUNDING FIVE BILLION. DOLLARS A YEAR PART OF IT SO. SEVEN OR FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR TRANSIT. PROJECTS. TRANSIT. AGENCIES. THEN THERE'S A CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM FOR TRANSIT. THERE'S GONNA BE OTHER TRANSIT INVESTMENTS LOCAL GOVERNMENT PASSED SEIZE. TRANSIT TO. THE I KNOW SURE MA'AFU OF THE. HERE IS. DOES DOES. INVESTMENT TRANSIT. HAVE YOU SEEN IN THOSE AREAS WERE TRANSIT HAS BEEN. INVESTMENTS HAVE TAKEN PLACE LIKE TRANSIT STATIONS. AND THEY INCREASED. ACOSTA HOUSING. IT IS IN THOSE AREAS HAVE THAT HAS AT LAST TO. DISPLACEMENT. ECONOMICALLY. WHEN. WE PUT THESE TRANSIT PROJECTS AND WE DON'T. WE WE WE YOU KNOW THAT BECOMES AN ATTRACTIVE AREA WHEN YOU HAVE A TRANSIT STATION THERE. YEAH LIKE. LIGHT RAIL BARDS MUNY WHATEVER. SO IN SHORT YES SO LAST YEAR WHEN IT IS THAT DOES THAT AFFECT. SO LAST YEAR WE PUT OUT OUR REPORT FROM OUR AIR BE FUNDED RESEARCH ON THAT PRECISE QUESTION AND WE DID FIND THAT. TRANSIT AREAS WHAT WE SAW THAT IT WAS A MAJOR FACTOR IN INFLUENCING. GENTRIFICATION AND DISPLACEMENT SERVE AT THE AGGREGATE LEVEL ON THEIR SUMMER RESEARCH THAT CAME OUT FROM U. S. C. THIS PAST YEAR LOOKING AT THE MORE INDIVIDUAL HOUSEHOLD LEVEL THERE'S A TON OF RESEARCH OUT THERE THAT SHOWS THAT TRANSIT NEW TRANSIT. INVESTMENT HAS AND. IS AN AMENITY THAT PEOPLE WANT INCREASE HOUSING PRICES. SO HOW WOULD STRATEGIES ARE THERE FOR. PROTECT DO. I THINK YOU KNOW ONE AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT TO LEARN WHAT'S HAPPENING DOWN IN LOS ANGELES AND THINKING ABOUT THEIR NO NET LOSS POLICY COLLINS HAS. TRANSIT. YES A HOUSE THERE CAN AFFECT THE. A NEIGHBORHOODS AROUND THERE. MOST A IF IT FITS ONE REASONS WHY. SOME OF THE. SOME OF THE KIND OF COMMUNITY THIS GROUPS ARE SO NERVOUS ABOUT CENTER WIENER SPELL. WELL YEAH WILL. LIVE THE READ THE NEWS THE NEW BELL ATLANTIC I GUESS OR WHERE BUT THE LOS ANGELES. WELL WE WE GOT TIED FOR. GOT ABOUT THAT AFTER. I'M IT IS A DISPLACEMENT I THINK. I THINK THEIR SOMEWHAT OF A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE HERE. A CLASS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST BY. NOT PROVIDING REPLACEMENT HOUSING. BRIT WAS SO THERE'S SORT OF THIS REPLACEMENT HOUSING NUMBER DEBASEMENT HOUSING. BUILDS UP THE. ALSO ALL THE FOR A HOUSING DISAPPEARS. AND. YOU'VE ONLY GOT IT IN NO THAT WAS I HAPPEN THEN YOU HAVE ALL THE STATE IS SAY HEY IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IF YOU DO THIS RIGHT THE SERVER LIKE. KNOWLEDGE BEFOREHAND YOU KNOW THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN AND YET THE NOTHING'S DONE ABOUT. THAT'S KIND OF. YEAH SO I MEAN AS I SAID THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT WORK HAPPENING IN LA ABOUT THIS AND HOW THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT NO NET LOSS HOW TO INVENTORY AFFORDABLE HOUSING RIGHT NOW AND MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT LOSING IT PEOPLE THAT LOSE IT HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THEY. HAVE THE RIGHT TO RETURN. HEY WE STABILIZE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY TAKING IT OFF OF THIS THE SPECULATIVE MARKET IN THOSE AREAS RIGHT NOW SO I THINK THERE IS ACTUALLY. QUITE A BIT THAT CAN BE DONE QUITE A BIT THE CAN BE ADDED TO THIS BILL MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU ALL ARE WORKING VERY HARD AT DOING THAT ARE THAT SENATOR WIENER STAFF IS. IN IT SO I THINK THERE'S TREMENDOUS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT BECAUSE WE NEED NEW HOUSING NEAR TRANSIT THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO QUESTION WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR AIR BE REPORT IS THAT WE'VE SEVERELY UNDER PRODUCED HOUSING. GS ACROSS THE BOARD BUT ESPECIALLY IN TRANSIT AREAS. SO WE NEED THE NEW HOUSING OR NEED TO. A BOTH THERE HAS NOT BEEN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PRODUCTION OF HOUSING HERE TRANSIT ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO. GREAT THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS A VERY HELPFUL IN HELPING US. THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE AND WHAT ARE TWO RESPECTIVE COMMITTEES WILL HAVE TO FOCUS ON. TWENTY. LET ME JUST TAKE A MOMENT AND ASK IF THERE'S ANYONE WHO'D LIKE TO SAY THE WORDS AND PUBLIC COMMENT. OKAY A TO INDIVIDUALS. PLEASE STEP UP. SHORT. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M SURE REPORT WITH THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. I JUST WANTED TO TOUCH ON THE SP TO YOUR ONE FUNDING FOR HOMELESSNESS. AND. WOULD SAY WE ARE GOAL IS TO MAKE THAT FUNDING AS IMPACTFUL AS POSSIBLE TO SUSTAINABLE AS POSSIBLE. TO DO THAT WE REALLY DO NOT BELIEVE IT SHOULD GO OUT BY FORMULA TO EVERY JURISDICTION. WE THINK IT SHOULD BE FOR SELECTORS TO ACTIONS TO DEMONSTRATE NEED AND COMMITMENT. FIRST THE STAND ABILITY WE THINK THAT THE COMMITMENT OF THOSE JURISDICTION SHOULD BE THAT THEY ARE GONNA COMMIT FUTURE SP TWO DOLLARS. FOR THE SAME PURPOSES. WE ALSO I THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOME LEVEL OF FLEXIBILITY TO YOUR COMMENT. ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHIU AROUND FLEXIBILITY VERSES TARGETED USE OF THOSE RESOURCES. THERE SHOULD BE SOME FLEXIBILITY BUT STILL TRYING TO MEET THE GAP AND HOUSING NEEDS. IN ORDER TO HAVE THE BIGGEST IMPACT AND THAT IN OUR OPINION WE AGREE WITH MR COLONY. THAT THE FUNDING SHOULD GO FOR OPERATING SUBSIDIES AND RENTAL ASSISTANCE PRIMARILY. THAT COULD BE DONE THROUGH A RENTAL ASSISTANCE POOL THAT COULD FUND A VARIETY OF MEASURES DEPENDING ON THE LOCAL NEED. WE DO THINK THAT THE FUNDING SHOULD ALSO BE FOCUSED ON PEOPLE EXPERIENCING CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS OTHER STATES HAVE DONE THAT AND I HAVE SEEN DRAMATIC. DECREASES IN CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS WHEREAS IN OUR STATE WE HAVE NOW FORTY TWO PERCENT OF THE NATION'S CHRONICALLY HOMELESS POPULATION AND THAT. SHARE INCREASES EVERY YEAR. I'M AND THEN FINALLY I WOULD TO SAY THAT. AGAIN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FUNDING IS SUSTAINABLE. AND THAT IT IS OF THOSE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE COMMITTING FUTURE ALLOCATIONS OF THE S. B. TWO DOLLARS. AND THAT WILL ENSURE THAT SOMETHING LIKE RENTAL SYSTEMS COULD BE SO STAINED OVER TIME. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR. TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SPEAKER. JEFF STARTED YET AN ADVOCATE. I'M HERE IS DOG FIGHT BECAUSE I CAME HERE AS PART OF A SUBCOMMITTEE OF HOUSING WANTING TO SEE HOW I CAN EDUCATE BETTER PEOPLE. DEALING WITH THE SP TWO FUNDING. I'VE ATTENDED YOUR STAKEHOLDERS FOR THE NO PLACE AT HOME AND EVERYTHING ELSE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. YOU ARE PROBLEMS IN PUBLIC INPUT YOU NEED TO SEEK BETTER MEANS OF PUBLIC INPUT LIKE HERE. YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN HERE FOR A NUMBER OF YOUR HOUSING HERE MEANS THERE'S VERY FEW OF US HERE RIGHT NOW. JUST LIKE THERE'S VERY FEW OF YOU HERE RIGHT NOW TO I BELIEVE ALLEN WOULD THERE IS A NUMBER OF STUDIES YOU AS YOU SAY WITH BOTH THE. SHALL WE SAY LIGHT RAIL LINES AND THE OTHER THINGS IN LOS ANGELES.
