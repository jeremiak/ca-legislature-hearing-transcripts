00:33:42.721 --> 00:33:47.092 region:rollup2
TRANSFER OF SOME OF THAT FUNDING

00:33:44.923 --> 00:33:48.727 region:rollup2
TO STATE OPERATIONS BUDGET FROM

SOME LANGUAGE AROUND OUR RULE

00:33:58.003 --> 00:34:01.106 region:rollup2
MAKING AUTHORITY.

00:33:59.271 --> 00:34:01.907 region:rollup2
BY LETTER FOR A LIMITED TWO

00:34:01.106 --> 00:34:04.142 region:rollup2

00:34:01.907 --> 00:34:05.210 region:rollup2
.

00:34:04.142 --> 00:34:06.311 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT'S BEEN

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:08.146 region:rollup2
RAISED WITH THE LANGUAGE AND

00:34:06.311 --> 00:34:09.381 region:rollup2
WE'RE OPEN TO ADD ADDITIONAL

THIS IS OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING

00:34:11.516 --> 00:34:14.953 region:rollup2
THAT HAS A BROAD RANGING IMPACT.

00:34:13.552 --> 00:34:16.922 region:rollup2
THIS LANGUAGE COVERS JUST THE I

00:34:14.953 --> 00:34:18.356 region:rollup2
JUST US PROGRAM BUT THERE'S

00:34:16.922 --> 00:34:19.791 region:rollup2
NEARLY A MILLION PEOPLE ARE THAT

00:34:18.356 --> 00:34:20.825 region:rollup2
WOULD BE POTENTIALLY AFFECTED BY

00:34:19.791 --> 00:34:21.960 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS

00:34:20.825 --> 00:34:23.528 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT.

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:24.930 region:rollup2
AND WE THINK THAT IT'S

00:34:23.528 --> 00:34:26.765 region:rollup2

WOULD MAKE THAT CLEAR BUT I

00:34:33.872 --> 00:34:37.876 region:rollup2
WANTED TO SAY THAT HERE ON THE

PROPOSAL DO APPEAR REASONABLE

00:34:52.123 --> 00:34:54.426 region:rollup2
AND WE UNDERSTAND THE

00:34:53.291 --> 00:34:56.895 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION MAY NEED SOME

00:34:54.426 --> 00:34:58.163 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY IN IMPLEMENTING EVP.

00:34:56.895 --> 00:34:59.564 region:rollup2

LANGUAGE BUT WE DO THINK IT

00:35:06.938 --> 00:35:09.507 region:rollup2
APPEARS TO MOVE IN THE RIGHT

00:35:08.873 --> 00:35:14.613 region:rollup2

POSITIONS THAT THEY NEED TO DO

00:35:27.792 --> 00:35:30.795 region:rollup2
ADEQUATE PLANNING AND

00:35:29.294 --> 00:35:31.696 region:rollup2
INTERACTION WITH STAKEHOLDERS

00:35:30.795 --> 00:35:33.098 region:rollup2
WERE CONCERNS THOUGH THAT

BUDGET BILL.

00:35:34.132 --> 00:35:37.736 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE PROPOSAL THAT'S OVERLY

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:40.238 region:rollup2
BROAD THAT WOULD GIVE THEM AS MR

00:35:37.736 --> 00:35:41.406 region:rollup2
SERVING COULD DESCRIBE RULE

00:35:40.238 --> 00:35:43.608 region:rollup2
MAKING AUTHORITY TO IMPLEMENT.

THINGS THAT THEY'VE TALKED ABOUT

00:35:44.943 --> 00:35:48.780 region:rollup2
THAT SOUND A REASSURING TO

00:35:47.178 --> 00:35:50.582 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS AS THEY'VE BEEN

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:52.617 region:rollup2
DISCUSSING UV VIS THAT THERE

00:35:50.582 --> 00:35:54.419 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT BE A GPS COMPONENT AND

00:35:52.617 --> 00:35:56.821 region:rollup2
I COULD GO ONE.

00:35:54.419 --> 00:35:57.889 region:rollup2
THAT WE WOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO

00:35:56.821 --> 00:35:59.424 region:rollup2

TO BE SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT THEY

00:35:59.424 --> 00:36:02.794 region:rollup2
COULD SPEND MONEY ON. BUT A

00:36:01.192 --> 00:36:05.196 region:rollup2
BROAD AUTHORITY FOR A TWO YEAR

00:36:02.794 --> 00:36:07.132 region:rollup2
PERIOD GIVES THE NEXT GOVERNOR

00:36:05.196 --> 00:36:08.733 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY TO DO SOMETHING THAT

00:36:07.132 --> 00:36:10.201 region:rollup2
THESE GOOD PEOPLE MAY NOT BE

00:36:08.733 --> 00:36:11.302 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY CONTEMPLATING WE

00:36:10.201 --> 00:36:13.338 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY SAW GOVERNOR

00:36:11.302 --> 00:36:15.707 region:rollup2
SCHWARZENEGGER. TURN THE PROGRAM

00:36:13.338 --> 00:36:17.042 region:rollup2
ON ITS HEAD A WHEN HE CAME INTO

00:36:15.707 --> 00:36:18.843 region:rollup2
OFFICE AND WE DON'T KNOW WHO THE

00:36:17.042 --> 00:36:21.546 region:rollup2
NEXT GOVERNOR WOULD BE SO TWO

00:36:18.843 --> 00:36:22.180 region:rollup2
YEARS OPEN AUTHORITIES. NOT

00:36:21.546 --> 00:36:24.749 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE COMFORTABLE

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:25.950 region:rollup2
WITH.

00:36:24.749 --> 00:36:26.985 region:rollup2
HER CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:28.720 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WE'VE HAD AN

00:36:26.985 --> 00:36:30.388 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THE.

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:32.724 region:rollup2
PROPOSED TO A BUDGET BILL

00:36:30.388 --> 00:36:34.659 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE SURE FROM LAST NIGHT

00:36:32.724 --> 00:36:36.294 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S GOING IT IS

00:36:34.659 --> 00:36:38.730 region:rollup2
IN THE DIRECTION THAT WE CAN

00:36:36.294 --> 00:36:39.864 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY LIVE WITH I CAN SAY.

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:40.999 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

00:36:39.864 --> 00:36:43.401 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN AND CERTAINLY

00:36:40.999 --> 00:36:44.869 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENT AND WORKED CLOSELY

00:36:43.401 --> 00:36:46.271 region:rollup2
WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND WE

00:36:44.869 --> 00:36:47.405 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THAT.

00:36:46.271 --> 00:36:49.174 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IT'S KAREN HAS

00:36:47.405 --> 00:36:51.709 region:rollup2
MENTIONED THERE'S ALWAYS CONCERN

00:36:49.174 --> 00:36:52.677 region:rollup2
OF WHAT TIME MAY HAPPEN. IN THE

00:36:51.709 --> 00:36:54.479 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE.

00:36:52.677 --> 00:36:57.348 region:rollup2
SO AS FAR AS THE.

00:36:54.479 --> 00:36:59.017 region:rollup2
THE LANGUAGE UP FRONT ON THE

00:36:57.348 --> 00:37:00.018 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY I THINK

00:36:59.017 --> 00:37:02.387 region:rollup2
WE'RE FINE WITH THAT AND I THINK

00:37:00.018 --> 00:37:05.256 region:rollup2
THE ELEMENTS IN THAT ARE GOOD.

00:37:02.387 --> 00:37:06.624 region:rollup2
BUT BUT WE TO SHARE THE CONCERN

00:37:05.256 --> 00:37:08.960 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE.

00:37:06.624 --> 00:37:09.994 region:rollup2
TWO YEAR PERIOD TO ACTUALLY

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:12.497 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT.

00:37:09.994 --> 00:37:14.466 region:rollup2
WITHOUT A REGULATION THROUGH

00:37:12.497 --> 00:37:17.001 region:rollup2
ALL COUNTY LETTER HOWEVER I

00:37:14.466 --> 00:37:19.671 region:rollup2
THINK IF SOMETHING IN THIS

00:37:17.001 --> 00:37:20.872 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE WAS PERHAPS. TIED MORE

00:37:19.671 --> 00:37:22.240 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY.

00:37:20.872 --> 00:37:25.176 region:rollup2
IT INTO THE.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:26.578 region:rollup2
THEY A LANGUAGE SHE IN A TO BE

00:37:25.176 --> 00:37:28.079 region:rollup2
ANOTHER WORDS IF WE KNOW

00:37:26.578 --> 00:37:31.416 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING THAT.

00:37:28.079 --> 00:37:34.018 region:rollup2
IS BEING LAID OUT IN THE PLAN.

00:37:31.416 --> 00:37:36.488 region:rollup2
BEFORE THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO

00:37:34.018 --> 00:37:38.690 region:rollup2
UTILIZE THE AUTHORITY TO DO YOU

00:37:36.488 --> 00:37:40.125 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT BY ALL COUNTY LETTER

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:41.960 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT WOULD MAKE US FEEL

00:37:40.125 --> 00:37:43.695 region:rollup2
MUCH BETTER AND AND WE CERTAINLY

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:46.064 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE WHEN

00:37:43.695 --> 00:37:49.067 region:rollup2
YOU'RE WORKING AGAINST FEDERAL.

00:37:46.064 --> 00:37:50.568 region:rollup2
TIMELINES TO MOVE QUICKLY AND

00:37:49.067 --> 00:37:52.003 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY WHERE THERE ARE

00:37:50.568 --> 00:37:53.338 region:rollup2
PENALTIES LE.

TO THE STATES WE DON'T WANNA

00:37:53.338 --> 00:37:58.476 region:rollup2
STAND IN THE WAY OF DOING THAT

00:37:56.341 --> 00:37:59.978 region:rollup2
SO SO WE WOULDN'T MIGHT SUGGEST

00:37:58.476 --> 00:38:02.347 region:rollup2
THAT THERE WOULD BE A WAY TO

00:37:59.978 --> 00:38:03.681 region:rollup2
TWEAK THAT SOME. AND AND MAYBE

00:38:02.347 --> 00:38:05.083 region:rollup2
TWO YEARS IS A LITTLE LONG AT

00:38:03.681 --> 00:38:08.153 region:rollup2
THIS POINT BUT.

00:38:05.083 --> 00:38:11.055 region:rollup2
MAYBE A YEAR'S WORTH OF THIS

00:38:08.153 --> 00:38:11.289 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY AND AGAIN THAT FOLLOWS

00:38:11.055 --> 00:38:12.257 region:rollup2

DO THIS THAT IS LEAST BURDENSOME

00:38:40.685 --> 00:38:43.621 region:rollup2
BUT WE JUST NEED TO BUILD IN

01:06:28.117 --> 01:06:32.455 region:rollup2
NEW ACTIVITY AND WE'RE PROPOSING

A COMBINATION OF FUN SOURCES IN

01:06:32.455 --> 01:06:34.824 region:rollup2

TO NOTE.

01:06:56.279 --> 01:07:00.450 region:rollup2
IT'S BASED ON THE MOST RECENT

01:06:58.248 --> 01:07:02.252 region:rollup2
DATA AND EXPERIENCE THAT WE HAVE

01:07:00.450 --> 01:07:03.987 region:rollup2

APPROVAL OF HOMES THAT OBVIOUSLY

01:07:08.358 --> 01:07:11.761 region:rollup2
IMPACTS THE ABILITY TO TAKE

01:07:10.093 --> 01:07:13.096 region:rollup2
CHILDREN FROM CONGREGATE KAREN

01:07:11.761 --> 01:07:14.898 region:rollup2

FAMILY CARE SETTINGS?

01:07:14.898 --> 01:07:20.036 region:rollup2
SO THAT THAT'S A MOVING SLOWER.

01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:21.838 region:rollup2

01:07:32.382 --> 01:07:36.152 region:rollup2
THAT THAT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES

CASELOAD PROJECTIONS.

01:17:29.378 --> 01:17:33.582 region:rollup2
WHICH DOES RESULT IN HIGHER

01:17:31.313 --> 01:17:35.050 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND FUND COSTA OF I

01:17:33.582 --> 01:17:36.352 region:rollup2
THINK A LOT OF THOSE END UP IN

01:17:35.050 --> 01:17:37.820 region:rollup2
THE IN THE BUDGET YEAR SO

01:17:36.352 --> 01:17:39.221 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN

01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:40.556 region:rollup2
PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED.

01:17:39.221 --> 01:17:42.324 region:rollup2
AND THAT THE SEC AT THAT

FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN

01:17:45.761 --> 01:17:50.466 region:rollup2
SINCE WE REALLY DON'T THINK ANY

01:17:47.630 --> 01:17:52.067 region:rollup2
A ADJUSTMENTS WELL. UP UP THERE

01:17:50.466 --> 01:17:53.168 region:rollup2
ARE IT'S UNLIKELY THAT MAJOR

01:17:52.067 --> 01:17:54.637 region:rollup2
ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE OCCURRING IN

01:17:53.168 --> 01:17:55.304 region:rollup2
THE ESSAY I IN IN THE CURRENT

YEAR.

01:17:55.304 --> 01:17:58.974 region:rollup2
WE DO THINK THAT THERE IS SOME

01:17:57.072 --> 01:18:00.543 region:rollup2
RISK THAT THERE COULD BE SOME

01:17:58.974 --> 01:18:02.645 region:rollup2
UNDER FUNDING IN THE BUDGET YEAR

01:18:00.543 --> 01:18:06.282 region:rollup2

CARE AMPLE IN INCREMENTS NOT

01:18:06.282 --> 01:18:08.217 region:rollup2
OCCUR AS QUICKLY AS US

01:18:07.650 --> 01:18:09.652 region:rollup2
DOOMED AS THE DEPARTMENT.

INTO THE ESTIMATE METHODOLOGY

01:18:11.086 --> 01:18:13.088 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S.

01:18:11.754 --> 01:18:13.923 region:rollup2
TO SEE IF THERE IS SOME RISK

01:18:13.088 --> 01:18:15.758 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY

01:18:13.923 --> 01:18:17.459 region:rollup2
OVERESTIMATING SAVINGS WHICH

01:18:15.758 --> 01:18:18.761 region:rollup2
COULD RESULT IN A ULTIMATELY IN

01:18:17.459 --> 01:18:20.296 region:rollup2
HIGHER COSTS OUT IN THE BUDGET

01:18:18.761 --> 01:18:22.998 region:rollup2

MAN AND PUBLIC AUTHORITY AD MAN

01:18:58.834 --> 01:19:02.104 region:rollup2
WE WERE VERY CONCERNED.

01:19:00.169 --> 01:19:03.672 region:rollup2
IN WHERE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES

01:19:02.104 --> 01:19:05.274 region:rollup2
HAVE LANDED WHEN THE STATE

01:19:03.672 --> 01:19:07.009 region:rollup2
COUNTY FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIP

01:19:05.274 --> 01:19:09.144 region:rollup2

THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN

01:19:12.748 --> 01:19:16.652 region:rollup2
WORKING VERY HARD WITH US SINCE

JANUARY TO CONSTRUCT A NEW

01:19:16.652 --> 01:19:20.422 region:rollup2
BUDGET WORKLOAD FORMULA AND THIS

01:19:18.887 --> 01:19:21.890 region:rollup2
FOR US WAS BRAND NEW TO TRY TO

01:19:20.422 --> 01:19:23.892 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT HOW MANY STAFF IT

01:19:31.033 --> 01:19:34.770 region:rollup2
SEPARATE TAT FROM. COUNTY

01:19:32.701 --> 01:19:36.205 region:rollup2
MANDATES I MENTION THAT BECAUSE

01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:37.640 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COUNTIES

01:19:36.205 --> 01:19:38.874 region:rollup2

PAYROLL.

01:19:42.845 --> 01:19:46.815 region:rollup2
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WHERE

01:19:44.847 --> 01:19:48.550 region:rollup2

01:19:46.815 --> 01:19:51.287 region:rollup2

01:21:06.261 --> 01:21:10.766 region:rollup2
ALLOW. FOR THE TRUE COST OF THE

01:21:09.031 --> 01:21:12.334 region:rollup2
SOCIAL WORKERS WHO ACTUALLY ARE

01:21:10.766 --> 01:21:13.669 region:rollup2
THAT MOST.

01:21:12.334 --> 01:21:14.636 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE HIGHER PAID AND MORE

01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:15.938 region:rollup2
SKILLED SOCIAL WORKERS WHO DO

01:21:14.636 --> 01:21:18.207 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:21:15.938 --> 01:21:20.275 region:rollup2
AND WHEN WHEN THAT DOESN'T

01:21:18.207 --> 01:21:22.344 region:rollup2
FACTORY INCORRECTLY BENNETT LOOK

01:21:20.275 --> 01:21:24.179 region:rollup2
PUTS PRESSURE DOWNWARD PRESSURE.

01:21:22.344 --> 01:21:25.414 region:rollup2
FIRST FROM THE COUNTIES AND TO

01:21:24.179 --> 01:21:27.583 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES.

01:21:25.414 --> 01:21:29.051 region:rollup2
THEN TO HAVE IT.

01:21:27.583 --> 01:21:30.519 region:rollup2
THAT I JUST ASK WORKERS AND THEN

01:21:29.051 --> 01:21:32.287 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY ON THE RECIPIENTS OF

01:21:30.519 --> 01:21:34.189 region:rollup2
THE SERVICES.

01:21:32.287 --> 01:21:35.891 region:rollup2
WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT SO JOE WE

01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:37.292 region:rollup2
THINK THAT WE'RE GLAD TO HEAR

01:21:35.891 --> 01:21:38.827 region:rollup2
THEY'RE WORKING ON ON COMING UP

01:21:37.292 --> 01:21:40.095 region:rollup2
WITH A BETTER ESTIMATE? THE

01:21:38.827 --> 01:21:42.297 region:rollup2
OTHER THING THAT'S MISSING IN

01:21:40.095 --> 01:21:44.133 region:rollup2
THE END THIS IS ACOSTA LIVING IF

01:21:42.297 --> 01:21:46.034 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T DO A COCA COLA. AND

01:21:44.133 --> 01:21:48.036 region:rollup2
NEXT YEAR IT ENDS UP BEYOND.

01:21:46.034 --> 01:21:49.538 region:rollup2
THAT DOWNWARD PRESSURE AGAIN AND

01:21:48.036 --> 01:21:51.273 region:rollup2
AND WE THINK THAT'S JUST WRONG

01:21:49.538 --> 01:21:52.641 region:rollup2
AND WE THINK THAT THE DEPARTMENT

01:21:51.273 --> 01:21:54.276 region:rollup2
AND THE COUNTIES CAN ACTUALLY

01:21:52.641 --> 01:21:55.677 region:rollup2
COME UP WITH THE REAL COST OF

01:21:54.276 --> 01:21:57.913 region:rollup2
WHAT A SOCIAL WORKER COSTS IN

01:21:55.677 --> 01:21:59.815 region:rollup2
THIS AREA. AND THEN COME UP WITH

01:21:57.913 --> 01:22:01.250 region:rollup2
A SLIGHTLY INCREASED THE AMOUNT

01:21:59.815 --> 01:22:03.252 region:rollup2
OF MONEY THAT WILL. REACH

01:22:01.250 --> 01:22:04.686 region:rollup2
ACCURATELY REFLECT THE TRUE

01:22:03.252 --> 01:22:07.156 region:rollup2
COSTS OF DOING THE ADMINSTRATION

01:22:04.686 --> 01:22:08.423 region:rollup2

WITH THE DEPARTMENT ON A NUMBER

01:22:26.375 --> 01:22:30.245 region:rollup2
OF IMPORTANT OUT BUDGETING

I JUST AS SOME WITH CAL WORKS.

01:22:34.249 --> 01:22:37.286 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN WORKING IN VERY GOOD

01:22:35.751 --> 01:22:38.620 region:rollup2
FAITH WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO

01:22:37.286 --> 01:22:40.722 region:rollup2
TRY TO TRUE THOSE UP TO WHAT IT

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:42.491 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY COST TO DO THOSE JOBS.

01:22:40.722 --> 01:22:43.659 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF ISSUES

01:22:42.491 --> 01:22:45.727 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'VE HEARD ALREADY TODAY

01:22:43.659 --> 01:22:47.062 region:rollup2
WHERE WE DO TAKE EXCEPTION TO

01:22:45.727 --> 01:22:48.063 region:rollup2
THE MAY REVISE AND WOULD LIKE TO

01:22:47.062 --> 01:22:49.097 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE

01:22:51.166 --> 01:22:54.970 region:rollup2
THE CAL WORK SINGLE ALLOCATION

01:22:52.534 --> 01:22:57.105 region:rollup2
AND WE HAD A TERRIFIC ENGAGEMENT

01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:59.241 region:rollup2
TO SORT OF TRUE UP. WHAT IT COST

01:22:57.105 --> 01:23:00.843 region:rollup2
TO DO THE ELIGIBILITY PORTION OF

01:22:59.241 --> 01:23:02.678 region:rollup2
THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM AND WE WE

01:23:00.843 --> 01:23:03.946 region:rollup2
HAVE ACTUALLY NO CONCERNS WITH

01:23:02.678 --> 01:23:05.113 region:rollup2
WHERE THAT LANDED?

01:23:03.946 --> 01:23:06.448 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENED THOSE BETWEEN

01:23:05.113 --> 01:23:07.850 region:rollup2
JANUARY AND MAY THERE WAS A

01:23:06.448 --> 01:23:09.818 region:rollup2
FURTHER CASELOAD REDUCTION THAT

01:23:07.850 --> 01:23:11.653 region:rollup2
WAS TAKEN? ASSOCIATED WITH THE

01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:13.222 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT SERVICES

01:23:11.653 --> 01:23:14.489 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THE NEXT COMPONENT THAT

01:23:13.222 --> 01:23:16.425 region:rollup2
WE'RE TACKLING WITH THE STATE TO

01:23:14.489 --> 01:23:17.860 region:rollup2
TRUE UP. WHAT WE'RE ASKING IS

01:23:16.425 --> 01:23:18.727 region:rollup2
THAT IN THE MEANTIME UNTIL WE

01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:20.195 region:rollup2
CAN FIGURE OUT A BETTER

01:23:18.727 --> 01:23:22.197 region:rollup2
METHODOLOGY FOR EMPLOYMENT

01:23:20.195 --> 01:23:23.866 region:rollup2
SERVICES WE NOT FURTHER TAKE A

01:23:22.197 --> 01:23:25.667 region:rollup2
CUT OF ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILLION

01:23:23.866 --> 01:23:27.369 region:rollup2
DOLLARS? WHICH WOULD BE ON TOP

01:23:25.667 --> 01:23:29.004 region:rollup2
OF ALMOST THREE HUNDRED MILLION

01:23:27.369 --> 01:23:30.639 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN THE PRIOR.

01:23:29.004 --> 01:23:31.206 region:rollup2
TWO AND A HALF YEARS SO WE

01:23:30.639 --> 01:23:32.908 region:rollup2
BASICALLY WANT TO STOP THE

01:23:31.206 --> 01:23:34.510 region:rollup2
BLEEDING. AND BE HELD HARMLESS

01:23:32.908 --> 01:23:36.478 region:rollup2
UNTIL WE CONTROL UP THE

01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:37.646 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT SERVICES METHODOLOGY.

01:23:36.478 --> 01:23:40.015 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO I JUST AS

01:23:37.646 --> 01:23:40.849 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION WE SIMILARLY HAVE

01:23:40.015 --> 01:23:43.285 region:rollup2
A.

01:23:40.849 --> 01:23:45.487 region:rollup2
A POSITION IN THAT WE CAME TO

01:23:43.285 --> 01:23:47.556 region:rollup2
AN AGREEMENT ON HOW MUCH WORK IS

01:23:45.487 --> 01:23:48.524 region:rollup2
IT TO DO I ASSESS THERE'S NO

01:23:47.556 --> 01:23:50.125 region:rollup2
DISAGREEMENT WITH THE

01:23:48.524 --> 01:23:51.293 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION AND. THE QUESTION

01:23:50.125 --> 01:23:52.594 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT

01:23:51.293 --> 01:23:53.595 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW IS.

01:23:52.594 --> 01:23:55.297 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH IS AN HOUR OF SOCIAL

01:23:53.595 --> 01:23:56.765 region:rollup2
WORK COST

01:23:55.297 --> 01:23:58.166 region:rollup2
IT'S AN EMPIRICAL QUESTION IT'S

01:23:56.765 --> 01:24:00.168 region:rollup2
NOT A THING THAT WERE?

01:23:58.166 --> 01:24:01.670 region:rollup2
SPECULATING ON BUT THERE'S A A

01:24:00.168 --> 01:24:04.006 region:rollup2
METHODOLOGY THAT ADMINISTRATION

01:24:01.670 --> 01:24:05.974 region:rollup2
USED WHICH WAS TO GO TO COUNTY

01:24:04.006 --> 01:24:07.242 region:rollup2
WEBSITES AND LOOK AT PUBLISHED

01:24:05.974 --> 01:24:09.311 region:rollup2
SALARY RANGES AND PICKED A

01:24:07.242 --> 01:24:10.646 region:rollup2
MIDPOINT. AND ASSUME THAT THAT'S

01:24:09.311 --> 01:24:11.446 region:rollup2
KIND OF WHAT.

01:24:10.646 --> 01:24:13.382 region:rollup2
PEOPLE SHOULD BE GETTING IN THAT

01:24:11.446 --> 01:24:14.783 region:rollup2
REGION.

01:24:13.382 --> 01:24:16.752 region:rollup2
AND WE POLL DATA THAT FROM

01:24:14.783 --> 01:24:18.053 region:rollup2
ACTUAL COUNTY COSTS

01:24:16.752 --> 01:24:19.688 region:rollup2
WHICH WE THINK IS A SUPERIOR

01:24:18.053 --> 01:24:20.822 region:rollup2
METHODOLOGY. THERE SOME

01:24:19.688 --> 01:24:22.491 region:rollup2
REFINEMENTS THAT THE

01:24:20.822 --> 01:24:24.326 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION WAS I'M ASKING

01:24:22.491 --> 01:24:25.460 region:rollup2
FOR IS AS LATE AS LAST NIGHT'S

01:24:24.326 --> 01:24:26.762 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA KEEP.

01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:28.730 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH THEM.

01:24:26.762 --> 01:24:31.366 region:rollup2
BUT WE BELIEVE OUR METHODOLOGY

01:24:28.730 --> 01:24:33.001 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY CLOSER TO REALITY

01:24:31.366 --> 01:24:34.770 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S THE REAL COST THAT

01:24:33.001 --> 01:24:35.737 region:rollup2
WE REPORT ON CLAIMS THAT ARE

01:24:34.770 --> 01:24:37.739 region:rollup2
SUBMITTED TO THE STATE AND

01:24:35.737 --> 01:24:39.007 region:rollup2
AUDITED BY THE STATE PURSUANT TO

01:24:37.739 --> 01:24:40.575 region:rollup2
A FEDERALLY MANDATED COST

01:24:39.007 --> 01:24:41.710 region:rollup2
ALLOCATION PROCESS.

01:24:40.575 --> 01:24:44.346 region:rollup2
AND WE THINK YOU SHOULD DEFER TO

01:24:41.710 --> 01:24:45.681 region:rollup2
THE ACTUAL AND NOT THE PROXIES

01:24:44.346 --> 01:24:46.281 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO THAT CONTINUOUS

01:24:45.681 --> 01:24:48.283 region:rollup2
CARE REFORM.

01:24:46.281 --> 01:24:49.584 region:rollup2
ON.

01:24:48.283 --> 01:24:50.385 region:rollup2
WE WOULD JUST UNDERSCORE SOME OF

01:24:49.584 --> 01:24:51.987 region:rollup2
THE ISSUES RAISED BY MISTER

01:24:50.385 --> 01:24:55.324 region:rollup2
JOHNSON.

01:24:51.987 --> 01:24:55.958 region:rollup2
FROM THE ALEJO WE BELIEVE THAT

01:24:55.324 --> 01:24:58.627 region:rollup2
EXCLUDING.

01:24:55.958 --> 01:25:01.029 region:rollup2
BACK LIKE CASES WHERE THERE IS

01:24:58.627 --> 01:25:02.998 region:rollup2
NOT IN EXISTING CHILD.

01:25:01.029 --> 01:25:04.766 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD BE ABOUT RE EXAMINED

01:25:02.998 --> 01:25:07.035 region:rollup2
WE HAVE FOR EXAMPLE RELATIVES

01:25:04.766 --> 01:25:08.303 region:rollup2
AWAITING APPROVAL WHO COULD BE

01:25:07.035 --> 01:25:10.672 region:rollup2
TAKING THEIR CAN.

01:25:08.303 --> 01:25:12.374 region:rollup2
CORPS IN THE BACKLOG AND SO WE

01:25:10.672 --> 01:25:13.809 region:rollup2
THINK IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO

01:25:12.374 --> 01:25:16.645 region:rollup2
FUND THE ENTIRE BACK RIDE.

01:25:13.809 --> 01:25:18.246 region:rollup2
BACKLOG NOT JUST A SUBSET THAT

01:25:16.645 --> 01:25:19.948 region:rollup2
WAS FUNDED IN THE MAY REVISION.

01:25:18.246 --> 01:25:21.550 region:rollup2
I AM WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT.

01:25:19.948 --> 01:25:24.086 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO THE LEVEL OF

01:25:21.550 --> 01:25:25.620 region:rollup2
CARE ASSESSMENT. AND CANS

01:25:24.086 --> 01:25:27.990 region:rollup2
THERE'S ACTUALLY SIGNIFICANTLY

01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:29.658 region:rollup2
MORE WORK FOR OUR WORKERS THAN

01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:30.993 region:rollup2
REFLECTED IN THAT IN THE MAY

01:25:29.658 --> 01:25:32.294 region:rollup2
REVISION THERE ARE SOME TIONS

01:25:30.993 --> 01:25:34.429 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE.

01:25:32.294 --> 01:25:37.399 region:rollup2
WITH CANS WHICH ISN'T A MAJOR A

01:25:34.429 --> 01:25:39.301 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT. THAT IT WILL REPLACE

01:25:37.399 --> 01:25:40.736 region:rollup2
NOT BE IN ADDITION TO

01:25:39.301 --> 01:25:42.471 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENTS THAT THE COUNTIES

01:25:40.736 --> 01:25:43.238 region:rollup2
ARE DOING CURRENTLY SO THE THE

01:25:42.471 --> 01:25:44.840 region:rollup2
MAY REVISE SAYS HEY WE THINK

01:25:43.238 --> 01:25:45.941 region:rollup2
THAT'S A WASH.

01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:47.509 region:rollup2
I'M WE DON'T BELIEVES THAT WE

01:25:45.941 --> 01:25:49.645 region:rollup2
PROVIDED AN ANALYSIS THAT

01:25:47.509 --> 01:25:51.446 region:rollup2
CROSSWALKS CURRENT REQUIREMENTS

01:25:49.645 --> 01:25:52.748 region:rollup2
TO THE NEW REQUIREMENTS THAT

01:25:51.446 --> 01:25:53.782 region:rollup2
SHOWS THE GAP FROM OUR

01:25:52.748 --> 01:25:56.018 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE WE UNDERSTAND THE

01:25:53.782 --> 01:25:57.285 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION. HASN'T DONE THAT

01:25:56.018 --> 01:25:58.487 region:rollup2
THAT SAME ANALYSIS BUT IT'S

01:25:57.285 --> 01:26:00.355 region:rollup2
WORKING ON IT BUT WE WOULD LIKE

01:25:58.487 --> 01:26:01.757 region:rollup2
TO SEE IT. ARMED BECAUSE OUR

01:26:00.355 --> 01:26:03.025 region:rollup2
WORKERS AND OUR MEMBERS ARE

01:26:01.757 --> 01:26:04.693 region:rollup2
TELLING US THAT IT IS

01:26:03.025 --> 01:26:06.828 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE WORK.

01:26:04.693 --> 01:26:07.796 region:rollup2
THAN CURRENT LAW AND FINALLY

01:26:06.828 --> 01:26:08.997 region:rollup2
WITH PAYMENT AT THE TIME OF

01:26:07.796 --> 01:26:10.532 region:rollup2
PLACEMENT NONE OF US HAVE HAD

01:26:08.997 --> 01:26:11.099 region:rollup2
SEEN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE

01:26:10.532 --> 01:26:12.134 region:rollup2
BUT I'D LIKE TO PUT A MARKER

01:26:11.099 --> 01:26:13.468 region:rollup2
AND.

01:26:12.134 --> 01:26:15.170 region:rollup2
WE ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE THAT

01:26:13.468 --> 01:26:16.271 region:rollup2
PROVIDER SHOULD GET STARK AND

01:26:15.170 --> 01:26:18.473 region:rollup2
PAID FROM THE MINUTE THEY GET A

01:26:16.271 --> 01:26:20.575 region:rollup2
CHILD THERE'S NO DISPUTE ABOUT

01:26:18.473 --> 01:26:22.778 region:rollup2
THAT. AB ONE TEN WAS A TERRIFIC

01:26:20.575 --> 01:26:24.312 region:rollup2
TEMPORARY COMPROMISE BUT IT

01:26:22.778 --> 01:26:26.882 region:rollup2
EXPIRES AND WHAT'S GOING IN ITS

01:26:24.312 --> 01:26:28.216 region:rollup2
PLACES AS WE UNDERSTAND IT

01:26:26.882 --> 01:26:30.652 region:rollup2
SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT.

PROGRAM WE THINK IS A VERY

01:28:25.367 --> 01:28:30.005 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT STEP ARM TO POINT THAT

KNOW ABOUT THESE PROGRAMS AND

01:28:49.591 --> 01:28:52.994 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT REALLY CLEAR HOW TO

01:28:51.159 --> 01:28:54.930 region:rollup2

OUR FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN

THAT WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED

01:32:31.012 --> 01:32:34.349 region:rollup2
THROUGH MAY REVISE. IS GOING TO

01:32:32.947 --> 01:32:36.251 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO PUT MANY OF THESE

01:32:34.349 --> 01:32:38.019 region:rollup2
FAMILIES IN THE LURCH BECAUSE

PRIOR TO BEING APPROVED THE

01:32:48.596 --> 01:32:51.299 region:rollup2
FIRST IS THAT THERE HAS TO BE

01:32:50.632 --> 01:32:53.068 region:rollup2
FUNDING FROM THE MOMENT A

01:32:51.299 --> 01:32:54.702 region:rollup2
PLACEMENT. ALL THE WAY THROUGH

01:32:53.068 --> 01:32:55.904 region:rollup2
TO APPROVAL AND IT APPEARS THAT

01:32:54.702 --> 01:32:58.073 region:rollup2
THE SHORT TERM OR THE LONG TERM

01:32:55.904 --> 01:33:00.442 region:rollup2
SOLUTION IS LIMITING FUNDING TO

01:32:58.073 --> 01:33:02.410 region:rollup2
SIX MONTHS IN THIS FISCAL YEAR

01:33:00.442 --> 01:33:04.512 region:rollup2
AND NINETY DAYS IN SUBSEQUENT

01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:06.181 region:rollup2
FISCAL YEARS. AND IT IS NOT

01:33:04.512 --> 01:33:07.282 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE ALWAYS TO GET FAMILIES

01:33:06.181 --> 01:33:08.716 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE APPROVAL PROCESS

01:33:07.282 --> 01:33:09.284 region:rollup2
WITHIN SIX MONTHS WE KNOW THERE

01:33:08.716 --> 01:33:11.019 region:rollup2
ARE MANY MANY FAMILIES RIGHT

01:33:09.284 --> 01:33:12.654 region:rollup2
NOW.

01:33:11.019 --> 01:33:14.489 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE BEEN PENDING FOR MUCH

01:33:12.654 --> 01:33:15.690 region:rollup2
LONGER THAN SIX MONTHS SO THE

01:33:14.489 --> 01:33:17.092 region:rollup2
SOLUTION HAS TO ACCOUNT FOR

01:33:15.690 --> 01:33:19.227 region:rollup2
THOSE FAMILIES WHO THE ENTIRE

01:33:17.092 --> 01:33:20.895 region:rollup2
PERIOD OF TIME. IT ALSO NEEDS TO

01:33:22.297 --> 01:33:25.400 region:rollup2
WHAT ACTUALLY HAS BEEN IN THE

01:33:23.665 --> 01:33:27.502 region:rollup2
SHORT TERM SOLUTION AND PROPOSED

01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:28.470 region:rollup2
IN THE LONG TERM SOLUTION. IS

01:33:27.502 --> 01:33:30.605 region:rollup2
THAT THE FUNDING IS TIED TO THE

01:33:28.470 --> 01:33:32.207 region:rollup2
APPLICATION OF THE RK

01:33:30.605 --> 01:33:33.708 region:rollup2

SUBMITTED AND SO SAYING THAT THE

01:33:42.851 --> 01:33:45.587 region:rollup2
FUNDING DOESN'T START UNTIL THE

01:33:44.052 --> 01:33:47.122 region:rollup2

REFORMS.

01:33:51.292 --> 01:33:53.695 region:rollup2
AND THERE HAS TO BE CONTINUITY

01:33:51.926 --> 01:33:54.996 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE SHORT TERM SOLUTION

01:33:53.695 --> 01:33:56.297 region:rollup2
AND THE LONG TERM SOLUTIONS

01:33:54.996 --> 01:33:58.399 region:rollup2

01:41:50.004 --> 01:41:52.974 region:rollup2
SELECTED THAT TOOL AND IS THAT

01:41:51.205 --> 01:41:54.508 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT ONE?

01:41:52.974 --> 01:41:56.210 region:rollup2
WHAT WE ARE GOING TO WANT TO

01:41:54.508 --> 01:41:58.446 region:rollup2
LOOK AT IS WHETHER OR NOT

01:41:56.210 --> 01:42:01.148 region:rollup2
THERE'S A PHASE AND POSSIBILITY?

01:41:58.446 --> 01:42:03.284 region:rollup2
COULD WE AS A STATE POTENTIALLY.

01:42:01.148 --> 01:42:05.319 region:rollup2
.

01:42:03.284 --> 01:42:06.921 region:rollup2
THAT EMPLOYMENT AND LOOK AT

01:42:05.319 --> 01:42:08.522 region:rollup2
WHETHER THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE

01:42:06.921 --> 01:42:10.191 region:rollup2
TO ON HOW WE WOULD DO THAT I

01:42:08.522 --> 01:42:11.759 region:rollup2
WILL LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING

01:42:10.191 --> 01:42:13.594 region:rollup2
WITH YOUR TEAM.

01:42:11.759 --> 01:42:15.029 region:rollup2
WE HAVE SOME POTENTIAL IDEAS

01:42:13.594 --> 01:42:16.764 region:rollup2
WE'D LIKE TO PROPOSE.

01:42:15.029 --> 01:42:18.032 region:rollup2
BUT HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT IT

01:42:16.764 --> 01:42:19.367 region:rollup2
DOES AND WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL

01:42:18.032 --> 01:42:21.168 region:rollup2
FUNDS.

01:42:19.367 --> 01:42:22.803 region:rollup2
AND THAT THOSE ACTUAL COSTS WILL

01:42:21.168 --> 01:42:24.405 region:rollup2
BE BORNE BY THE STATE AND WANTS

01:42:22.803 --> 01:42:26.474 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE THAT.

01:42:24.405 --> 01:42:28.409 region:rollup2
WE HAVE SELECTED THE RIGHT TOOL

01:42:26.474 --> 01:42:29.276 region:rollup2
FOR THE RIGHT PLACES

01:42:28.409 --> 01:42:30.911 region:rollup2
LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU

01:42:29.276 --> 01:42:32.246 region:rollup2
ON THAT.

01:42:30.911 --> 01:42:34.515 region:rollup2
I'M REGARDING THE.

01:42:32.246 --> 01:42:36.751 region:rollup2
ISSUE SEVEN OF THE RFA BACKLOG.

01:42:34.515 --> 01:42:40.488 region:rollup2
.

01:42:36.751 --> 01:42:42.890 region:rollup2
I WOULD ECHO THE COMMENTS THAT.

01:42:40.488 --> 01:42:43.391 region:rollup2
WHY WE AREN'T?

01:42:42.890 --> 01:42:45.793 region:rollup2
TRYING TO FIX THE ENTIRE

01:42:43.391 --> 01:42:47.028 region:rollup2
BACKLOG.

01:42:45.793 --> 01:42:49.797 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE CAN PLACE AS MANY

01:42:47.028 --> 01:42:52.833 region:rollup2
FAMILIES AS POSSIBLE AND.

01:42:49.797 --> 01:42:54.535 region:rollup2
WOOD LOOKS TO ASK THE

01:42:52.833 --> 01:42:56.737 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT AGAIN WHY BIT FOCUSED

01:42:54.535 --> 01:42:59.006 region:rollup2
ON A SECTION OF IT RATHER THAN

01:42:56.737 --> 01:42:59.607 region:rollup2
THE ENTIRETY OF THE BACKLOG AND

01:42:59.006 --> 01:43:00.708 region:rollup2
WHAT THE REASONING WAS BEHIND

01:42:59.607 --> 01:43:03.377 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:43:00.708 --> 01:43:05.246 region:rollup2
SO THAT WILL BE A QUESTION.

01:43:03.377 --> 01:43:07.481 region:rollup2
AND THEN FINALLY REGARDING THE

01:43:05.246 --> 01:43:09.316 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF CARE ASSESSMENT ISSUE

01:43:07.481 --> 01:43:10.851 region:rollup2
NINE. WANTED TO. GET AN

01:43:09.316 --> 01:43:13.421 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING IT SEEMS THAT THE

01:43:10.851 --> 01:43:15.222 region:rollup2
COUNTIES AND CWD A ARE. BOTH

01:43:13.421 --> 01:43:16.690 region:rollup2
SAYING THAT THE.

01:43:15.222 --> 01:43:17.925 region:rollup2
RFA BACKLOG IN THE LEVEL OF CARE

01:43:16.690 --> 01:43:20.227 region:rollup2
HAVE NOT.

01:43:17.925 --> 01:43:21.695 region:rollup2
THAT ARE THERE NOT ENOUGH.

01:43:20.227 --> 01:43:23.798 region:rollup2
AND I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE

01:43:21.695 --> 01:43:24.765 region:rollup2
METHODOLOGY BEHIND WHY THOSE

01:43:23.798 --> 01:43:26.300 region:rollup2
NUMBERS WERE SELECTED AND

01:43:24.765 --> 01:43:28.002 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT.

01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:32.440 region:rollup2
ADEQUATELY ADDRESSES.

01:43:28.002 --> 01:43:34.675 region:rollup2
THE NEEDS THAT WE HAVE.

01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:35.976 region:rollup2
BUT I HAVE.

01:43:34.675 --> 01:43:36.377 region:rollup2
PITCHER BANKER WITH THE

01:43:35.976 --> 01:43:38.079 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT AGAIN.

01:43:36.377 --> 01:43:39.947 region:rollup2
LET LET ME START FIRST WITH THE

01:43:38.079 --> 01:43:42.917 region:rollup2
A RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL

01:43:39.947 --> 01:43:45.119 region:rollup2
BACKLOG ON THEM.

01:43:42.917 --> 01:43:46.687 region:rollup2
WE TAILOR DE WE RECOGNIZE THAT

01:43:45.119 --> 01:43:48.689 region:rollup2
THE EFFORT HERE IS ON GOING

01:43:46.687 --> 01:43:50.124 region:rollup2
THERE IS A BASELINE OF FINDING

01:43:48.689 --> 01:43:50.624 region:rollup2
FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

01:43:50.124 --> 01:43:52.093 region:rollup2
RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL

01:43:50.624 --> 01:43:54.161 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

01:43:52.093 --> 01:43:55.830 region:rollup2
NOT ALL COUNTIES HAVE FULLY

01:43:54.161 --> 01:43:58.065 region:rollup2
EXPANDED DOT AND THEY CONTINUE

01:43:55.830 --> 01:43:59.900 region:rollup2
TO TO WORK ON THAT. DID THIS

01:43:58.065 --> 01:44:01.836 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT IS TARGETED PIT

01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:03.170 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY TO THE BACKLOG AND

01:44:01.836 --> 01:44:05.506 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY TO THE BACKLOG

01:44:03.170 --> 01:44:06.941 region:rollup2
WHERE PLACEMENTS ACTUALLY EXIST

01:44:05.506 --> 01:44:08.509 region:rollup2
NOW.

01:44:06.941 --> 01:44:10.411 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE THINK THAT'S THE

01:44:08.509 --> 01:44:12.446 region:rollup2
FIRST PRIORITY FOR WHERE

01:44:10.411 --> 01:44:14.615 region:rollup2
ATTENTION SHOULD BE FOCUSED.

01:44:12.446 --> 01:44:16.450 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT WE DON'T

01:44:14.615 --> 01:44:17.685 region:rollup2
STILL NEED RESOURCE FAMILIES TO

01:44:16.450 --> 01:44:20.020 region:rollup2
BE APPROVED SO THAT THEY'RE

01:44:17.685 --> 01:44:21.655 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE FOR FOR CHILDREN.

01:44:20.020 --> 01:44:23.624 region:rollup2
THAT NEED THAT PLACEMENT.

01:44:21.655 --> 01:44:24.792 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN THERE ISN'T AN ACTIVE

01:44:23.624 --> 01:44:26.293 region:rollup2
CHILD THERE OR IT'S NOT

01:44:24.792 --> 01:44:28.429 region:rollup2
UNNECESSARILY A PLACE THAT'S

01:44:26.293 --> 01:44:29.797 region:rollup2
ACTIVELY UNDER CONSIDERATION WE

01:44:28.429 --> 01:44:31.165 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S A LOWER PRIORITY

01:44:29.797 --> 01:44:32.933 region:rollup2
THAN WHERE CHILDREN ARE TODAY

01:44:31.165 --> 01:44:35.169 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THE. THE RATIONALE

01:44:32.933 --> 01:44:36.637 region:rollup2
GENERALLY SPEAKING FOR FOR WHY

01:44:35.169 --> 01:44:38.606 region:rollup2
WE TARGETED THAT PIECE OF THE

01:44:36.637 --> 01:44:39.840 region:rollup2
BACKLOG SO IT SOUNDS AS IF

01:44:38.606 --> 01:44:42.376 region:rollup2
YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S LOW

01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:44.145 region:rollup2
HANGING FRUIT THAT. WE SHOULD BE

01:44:42.376 --> 01:44:45.412 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING FIRST AND FOREMOST.

01:44:44.145 --> 01:44:47.181 region:rollup2
I GUESS THE QUESTION I'M TRYING

01:44:45.412 --> 01:44:48.382 region:rollup2
TO UNDERSTAND IS.

01:44:47.181 --> 01:44:50.317 region:rollup2
DOES THE REMAINDER OF THE

01:44:48.382 --> 01:44:52.253 region:rollup2
BACKLOG INHIBIT PLACEMENT OF

01:44:50.317 --> 01:44:54.755 region:rollup2
FOSTER KIDS NOW.

01:44:52.253 --> 01:44:56.323 region:rollup2
AND WHAT IT. BENEFIT US IS A

01:44:54.755 --> 01:44:57.992 region:rollup2
STATE TO TAKE CARE OF THE ENTIRE

01:44:56.323 --> 01:44:59.527 region:rollup2
BACKLOG.

01:44:57.992 --> 01:45:00.995 region:rollup2
I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT I

01:44:59.527 --> 01:45:02.496 region:rollup2
THINK EIGHT IN ADDITION TO THIS

01:45:00.995 --> 01:45:03.697 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT AS I MENTIONED

01:45:02.496 --> 01:45:05.699 region:rollup2
THERE'S A BASELINE LEVEL OF

01:45:03.697 --> 01:45:05.900 region:rollup2
FUNDING FOR RESOURCE FAMILIES.

01:45:05.699 --> 01:45:08.102 region:rollup2
AND.

01:45:05.900 --> 01:45:08.669 region:rollup2
APPROVAL PROCESS SEES AND I

01:45:08.102 --> 01:45:10.271 region:rollup2
THINK THE COMBINATION OF THE

01:45:08.669 --> 01:45:11.505 region:rollup2
TWO.

01:45:10.271 --> 01:45:13.641 region:rollup2
DIMINISHING THIS PART OF THE

01:45:11.505 --> 01:45:15.242 region:rollup2
BACKLOG AYE I WOULD SAYIS THAT

01:45:13.641 --> 01:45:16.443 region:rollup2
THE HIGH HANGING MOST OF THE

01:45:15.242 --> 01:45:17.912 region:rollup2
HIGH PRIORITY.

01:45:16.443 --> 01:45:20.281 region:rollup2
FRUIT IF YOU WILL.

01:45:17.912 --> 01:45:22.616 region:rollup2
AND THAT THE BASELINE LEVEL OF

01:45:20.281 --> 01:45:24.418 region:rollup2
FUNDING WE BELIEVE IS IS

01:45:22.616 --> 01:45:25.753 region:rollup2
ADEQUATE IT'S CONSISTENT WITH

01:45:24.418 --> 01:45:27.688 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'VE PROPOSED A

01:45:25.753 --> 01:45:29.390 region:rollup2
HISTORICALLY AND OTHERS HAVE

01:45:27.688 --> 01:45:30.991 region:rollup2
FOUND ACCEPTABLE WE THINK THE

01:45:29.390 --> 01:45:33.027 region:rollup2
REST OF THE BACKLOG WILL RESOLVE

01:45:30.991 --> 01:45:34.862 region:rollup2
ITSELF OVER TIME. AS EVERYBODY

01:45:33.027 --> 01:45:35.429 region:rollup2
TOGETHER GETS BETTER AT AT THE

01:45:34.862 --> 01:45:38.699 region:rollup2
FAMILY APPROVAL PROCESS SO I

01:45:35.429 --> 01:45:39.600 region:rollup2
I'M.

01:45:38.699 --> 01:45:40.034 region:rollup2
TELLING YOU THAT THE

01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:41.368 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION FEELS

01:45:40.034 --> 01:45:42.937 region:rollup2
COMFORTABLE.

01:45:41.368 --> 01:45:43.204 region:rollup2
THAT THE ENTIRE BACKLOG WILL

01:45:42.937 --> 01:45:44.905 region:rollup2
OVER TIME.

01:45:43.204 --> 01:45:46.473 region:rollup2
.

01:45:44.905 --> 01:45:47.508 region:rollup2
BE RESOLVED BY BY THE LEVEL OF

01:45:46.473 --> 01:45:48.776 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT.

01:45:47.508 --> 01:45:50.678 region:rollup2
THAT WE BELIEVE HAS AS A

01:45:48.776 --> 01:45:52.680 region:rollup2
ACCURATELY.

01:45:50.678 --> 01:45:54.715 region:rollup2
IN THE BUDGET AND I JUST WANT TO

01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:56.450 region:rollup2
PUT A PIN INTO THE CONVERSATION

01:45:54.715 --> 01:45:59.019 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE LEVEL OF CARE

01:45:56.450 --> 01:46:00.821 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT AS. I DO NOT

01:45:59.019 --> 01:46:02.890 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THIS IS AN ONGOING.

01:46:00.821 --> 01:46:03.757 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT WILL NEED

01:46:02.890 --> 01:46:05.526 region:rollup2
ADJUSTMENTS THROUGH TIME BUTTON.

01:46:03.757 --> 01:46:07.194 region:rollup2
JUST.

01:46:05.526 --> 01:46:09.163 region:rollup2
ONCE TED ECHO AND MAKE SURE

01:46:07.194 --> 01:46:09.763 region:rollup2
WE'RE BEING RECEPTIVE TO WHAT

01:46:09.163 --> 01:46:11.031 region:rollup2
WE'RE HEARING ON THE GROUND AS

01:46:09.763 --> 01:46:12.533 region:rollup2
WELL.

01:46:11.031 --> 01:46:14.301 region:rollup2
FINALLY REGARDING ISSUE EIGHT.

01:46:12.533 --> 01:46:15.636 region:rollup2
.

01:46:14.301 --> 01:46:16.870 region:rollup2

.

01:46:21.942 --> 01:46:27.047 region:rollup2
THAT BUT WHO.

01:46:24.311 --> 01:46:27.648 region:rollup2
I HAVE CONCERNS IF WERE NOT

01:46:27.047 --> 01:46:28.849 region:rollup2
CREATING THE CONTINUITY OF THE

01:46:27.648 --> 01:46:31.318 region:rollup2

THIS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE

01:46:39.593 --> 01:46:42.329 region:rollup2
REFLECTS MORE OF THAT THAN.

01:46:40.995 --> 01:46:43.664 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE HEARING HERE TODAY
