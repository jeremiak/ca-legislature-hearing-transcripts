ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY SEVENTY FIVE BY SOME A MEMBER BERMAN AND OTHERS AND ACTUALLY TO ELECTIONS MISTER BERMAN. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS EARLIER THIS YEAR THE ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS AND REDISTRICTING COMMITTEE HOLLOW JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON THE TOPIC OF ELECTION CYBERSECURITY. ONE OF THE RECURRING THEMES THAT EMERGED DURING THE TESTIMONY OF THE INFORMATIONAL HEARING IS THAT MAXIMIZING THE CYBERSECURITY OF OUR STATES ELECTIONS WON'T REQUIRE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES DEDICATED TO THAT PURPOSE. AB THIRTY SEVENTY FIVE CREATES THE OFFICE OF ELECTION CYBERSECURITY WITHIN THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE. SINCE THE ASSEMBLY'S PASSAGE OF THIS BILL THE STATE BUDGET INCLUDED TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CREATION OF THE OFFICE OF ELECTION CYBERSECURITY. THE BUDGET ACTION ALSO EXPANDED THE SCOPE OF THE OFFICES DUTIES TO INCLUDE MONITORING AND COUNTERACTING FALSE OR MISLEADING INFORMATION REGARDING THE ELECTORAL PROCESS. THE SENATE AMENDMENTS TO AB THIRTY SEVENTY FIVE SIMPLY BROADENED THE MISSION OF THE OFFICE TO CONFORM TO THE ACTION TAKEN AS PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS. AB THIRTY SEVENTY FIVE IS SUPPORTED BY SECRETARY OF STATE OUT EXPEDIA AND HAS NO OPPOSITION I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER BYRNE MISTER HARPER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. PROTECTING OUR ELECTIONS FROM HACKING IS IMPORTANT. HOWEVER ADDING THIS NEW GOVERNMENT AGENCY TO DO SO IS NOT. THE SECRETARY OF STATE TESTIFIED EARLIER THIS YEAR I TO THE ELECTIONS COMMITTEE THAT. KNEW THAT HE NEEDED MORE MONEY TO BE ABLE REPLACE AGING VOTING MACHINES BUT NOT A NEW AGENCY. A EVEN IN TWENTY SIXTEEN ARE ACCORDING TO TESTIMONY AT THAT SAME COMMITTEE. WINDOWS WERE IN A SUMMER ALLEGING THAT RUSSIA HAD MEDDLED IN OUR ELECTIONS IT WAS TESTIFIED THAT CALIFORNIA'S ELECTION SYSTEM HAD NOT BEEN COMPROMISE NOT ONE VOTE HAD BEEN CHANGED. WE DO NOT NEED OUT OF THE BUREAUCRACY TO CHECK TO PROTECT OUR ELECTION SYSTEM. ADDITIONALLY AND MORE IMPORTANTLY SPECIFIC TO THE SENATE AMENDMENTS WE SHOULD NOT GIVE THE SECRETARY OF STATE THE AUTHORITY TO DECIDE SUBJECTIVELY WHAT IS FALSE OR MISLEADING INFORMATION ELECTION. IF INDEED THIS WAS ABOUT MAKING SURE TO AVOID SITUATIONS IN WHICH SOMEONE WAS GIVING WRONG INFORMATION ABOUT NGUYEN TO VOTE HOW TO VOTE EX ACTOR. THEN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SPECIFICALLY AND NARROWLY TAILORED TO THAT BUT WHAT THIS EQUATES TO IS BEING ABLE TO FRANK DURING THE ELECTION PERIOD FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE. MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS THIS IS NOT. ONLY THIS IS JUST AN UNCONSCIONABLE AMENDMENT BECAUSE WHAT THIS IS ASKING US TO DO IS GET IN THE GO BEYOND OUR HAVING A SITUATION WHICH THEY'RE SIMPLY. COLLECTING THE VOTES AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE ELECTIONS ARE GOING SPECIFICALLY THE WAY THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO INTO HAVING. A SUBJECTIVE OPINION. CAMPAIGN ORIENTED COMMUNICATIONS BEING ADDED INTO THE DEBATE INTO THE ARENA AND TORE ELECTIONS PROCESS. MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY URGE FOR A VOTE AGAINST THIS BILL. SEEING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. BERMAN YOU MAY CLOSE JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT THIS IS A BILL THAT THE SECRETARY OF STATE SUPPORTS IT IS VERY NARROWLY TAILORED.
