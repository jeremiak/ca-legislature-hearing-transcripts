workforce development because

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.521

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:56.089

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:05.799
Reavis --

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:06.433
But what as we all know no

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:08.067
matter what community workforce

00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:20.980
is vital.

00:01:21.047 --> 00:01:21.681
Today we we will explore public

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:23.783
policy is to California report

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.689
which highlights the potential.

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:35.695
By twenty five of who will need.

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:43.837
HM but this it's about the story.

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:44.471
For those of you who know who

00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:45.972
anyone who's ever heard me speak

before recently California made

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:52.078
a significant investment into C.

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:54.047

00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:10.263
education programs.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.198
This funding is much needed

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:13.800
support for career technical

00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:15.735
education but is not the only

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:15.969
factor.

00:02:16.035 --> 00:02:19.739
California must better match it

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:21.674
supply of labor with demand.

00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:22.342
Information chair at sharing in

00:02:22.408 --> 00:02:23.710
do driven investments are

00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:24.410
critical in this endeavor and we

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:27.814
must examine how we at the state

00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:28.481
can facilitate this partnership.

00:02:28.548 --> 00:02:29.816
That a comprehensive and

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:30.416
collaborative effort across

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:31.851

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:33.920
institutions and workforce

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:34.454
development organizations

00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:36.122
California risk creating a

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:37.924
polarized economy of has and has

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:39.859
not.

00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:41.895
Such a realisation serves no one

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:42.395
and we must ensure all

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:43.997
Californians have the necessary

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:46.132
skills to secure employment that

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:48.001
provide economic security for

00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:49.836
their families --

00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:51.704
An apparent form a foundation

00:02:51.771 --> 00:02:53.740
for robust economy and of course

00:02:53.806 --> 00:02:55.808
we really aren't we need to

00:02:55.875 --> 00:02:56.409
focus on expanding our middle

00:02:56.476 --> 00:02:56.643
class.

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.612

I represent the thirty ninth

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:32.245
assembly district which is in

00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:34.280
the north the San Fernando

00:03:34.347 --> 00:03:34.514
Valley.

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:35.815
It includes --

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:38.251
Several communities like a claim --

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:40.219
Send Bally on the city of San

00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:43.823
Fernando is in my district --

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.758
I grew up in this district and

00:03:45.825 --> 00:03:47.961
when I was a kid --

00:03:48.027 --> 00:03:48.528
The north the San Fernando

00:03:48.595 --> 00:03:49.996
Valley had a lot of

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:53.933
manufacturing and aerospace jobs

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.634
so we had a price Pfister plant --

00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:56.135
Down the street from my

00:03:56.202 --> 00:03:58.071
elementary school that made

00:03:58.137 --> 00:03:59.973
faucets that were union jobs --

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:02.075
High skilled workers we had

00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:03.810
Lockheed --

00:04:03.876 --> 00:04:07.714
And other men aerospace industry --

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.749
And most people were able

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:10.049
[inaudible]

00:04:10.116 --> 00:04:14.287
In home you know a base you know

00:04:14.354 --> 00:04:15.922
small basic home but and I think

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.792
since we lost a lot those jobs

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:20.460
and a lot of the companies left

00:04:20.526 --> 00:04:21.961
that area --

00:04:22.028 --> 00:04:24.197
That community hasn't recovered --

00:04:24.263 --> 00:04:26.199
And that this is one of the

00:04:26.265 --> 00:04:30.003
reasons I'm very interested --

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:32.005
In the topic.

00:04:32.071 --> 00:04:32.572
You know today most of my

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:33.806
district is considered a

00:04:33.873 --> 00:04:35.975
disadvantaged community --

00:04:36.042 --> 00:04:40.213
Other issues that we have --

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:42.081
That come along with that --

00:04:42.148 --> 00:04:44.384
There's this week the LA times

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.685
is doing a series.

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:48.187
On child poverty in my district

00:04:48.254 --> 00:04:50.056
and focused on an elementary

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:52.158
school that I attended --

00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:54.260
So something I'm very passionate

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:55.728
about is --

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:58.297
Homeless children --

00:04:58.364 --> 00:05:00.433
But a lot of the reason some of

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.100
these families are homeless is

00:05:01.167 --> 00:05:02.435
because there aren't high

00:05:02.502 --> 00:05:04.303
skilled jobs --

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.141
That P. good weight is anymore

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:09.942

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:12.078
You know I believe that you know

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:14.113

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.915

00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:17.984

00:05:18.051 --> 00:05:19.986

00:05:45.712 --> 00:05:47.780
Right out of college and a lot

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:49.716

we have Serra bond director of

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:27.346
research and senior fellow of

00:07:27.413 --> 00:07:28.114
the public public policy

00:07:28.181 --> 00:07:31.784
institute of California.

00:07:31.851 --> 00:07:33.719
Thank you so much and thank you

00:07:33.786 --> 00:07:34.253
assembly member Burke for

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.855
convening this hearing and for

00:07:35.922 --> 00:07:38.324
including PP I see for those in

00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:38.991
the audience who aren't familiar

00:07:39.058 --> 00:07:40.426
with PP I see we are that public

00:07:40.493 --> 00:07:42.161
policy institute of California.

00:07:42.228 --> 00:07:44.263
A non partisan independent

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.332
research institute devoted to

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:47.800
studying policy issues critical

00:07:47.867 --> 00:07:50.102
to California and work forces at

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:52.305
the top of our list so I'm

00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:54.040
really pleased to be here today.

00:07:54.106 --> 00:07:55.975
Recently PP I see surveyed

00:07:56.042 --> 00:07:58.344
Californians on issues of higher

00:07:58.411 --> 00:08:00.179
education and the workforce and

00:08:00.246 --> 00:08:01.981
we found that 75% of

00:08:02.048 --> 00:08:05.985
Californians believe our public

00:08:06.052 --> 00:08:07.887
higher education system is vital.

00:08:07.954 --> 00:08:08.521
To of the quality of life here

00:08:08.588 --> 00:08:10.256
and economic vitality of

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:11.858
California and not only that

00:08:11.924 --> 00:08:14.327
they also 75%.

00:08:14.393 --> 00:08:14.994
And I think that this should be

00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:18.231
a high or very high priority for

00:08:18.297 --> 00:08:19.966
the next.

00:08:20.032 --> 00:08:20.633
The the new governor so this is

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.401
a really timely conversation

00:08:22.468 --> 00:08:24.003
right after the election.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.138
So thank you for convening this --

00:08:26.205 --> 00:08:28.207
Imprint.

00:08:28.274 --> 00:08:31.878
The majority of future jobs in

00:08:31.944 --> 00:08:33.980
California will require at least

00:08:34.046 --> 00:08:34.580
some college training about a

00:08:34.647 --> 00:08:37.617
third about his degree or higher

00:08:37.683 --> 00:08:38.150
in about a third community

00:08:38.217 --> 00:08:40.186
college training.

00:08:40.253 --> 00:08:42.021
And this --

00:08:42.088 --> 00:08:42.722
Shift is the result of you know

00:08:42.788 --> 00:08:44.323
long term trends in our economy

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:46.125
towards a knowledge based

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:47.793
economy.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:48.427
That effects not just what you

00:08:48.494 --> 00:08:50.062
jobs are created in California

00:08:50.129 --> 00:08:52.198
and the skill requirements there

00:08:52.265 --> 00:08:53.933
but also the skill requirements

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.935
in jobs that are already on line

00:08:56.002 --> 00:08:57.904
in our economy.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:00.206
In addition two empty so in in

00:09:00.273 --> 00:09:02.174
addition to improving kind of

00:09:02.241 --> 00:09:03.743
job availability I'm having a

00:09:03.809 --> 00:09:05.945
college degree or some college

00:09:06.012 --> 00:09:06.512
training also increase it

00:09:06.579 --> 00:09:09.815
incredibly improve access to

00:09:09.882 --> 00:09:10.349
better paying careers for

00:09:10.416 --> 00:09:11.984
Californians.

00:09:12.051 --> 00:09:13.920
This chart which I'm sorry it

00:09:13.986 --> 00:09:14.620
might be hard for some of you to

00:09:14.687 --> 00:09:16.055
see -- Shows

00:09:16.122 --> 00:09:17.990
the top ten job wrote that is

00:09:18.057 --> 00:09:21.961
projected of through.

00:09:22.028 --> 00:09:22.595
Twenty twenty six and what you

00:09:22.662 --> 00:09:24.330
see is another result of the

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:26.098
long term trends toward the

00:09:26.165 --> 00:09:27.934
knowledge based economy that.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.936
Has increased the gap in

00:09:30.002 --> 00:09:32.004
earnings --

00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:34.040
Ford between jobs that have

00:09:34.106 --> 00:09:34.707
require a college credential and

00:09:34.774 --> 00:09:36.042
those that do not.

00:09:36.108 --> 00:09:38.344
So among these top ten you see a

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:41.881
handful of careers in mainly

00:09:41.948 --> 00:09:43.816
service sectors --

00:09:43.883 --> 00:09:46.018
That pay less than thirty five

00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:46.619
thousand dollars a year jobs

00:09:46.686 --> 00:09:48.054
like personal care aides.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.089
Food preparation labor --

00:09:50.156 --> 00:09:51.924
And material movers --

00:09:51.991 --> 00:09:55.895
These jobs do not require.

00:09:55.962 --> 00:09:58.097
A college education.

00:09:58.164 --> 00:09:58.698
At the other extreme you see a

00:09:58.764 --> 00:09:59.865
handful of positions like

00:09:59.932 --> 00:10:02.034
software developers registered

00:10:02.101 --> 00:10:02.401
nurse thing --

00:10:02.468 --> 00:10:04.236
Operations managers market

00:10:04.303 --> 00:10:05.905
researchers --

00:10:05.972 --> 00:10:08.140
Earning three to four times as

00:10:08.207 --> 00:10:10.242
much as those lower skilled

00:10:10.309 --> 00:10:11.978
positions --

00:10:12.044 --> 00:10:13.913
And of course these are jobs and

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:14.513
careers that require college

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.850
education and this trend shows

00:10:17.917 --> 00:10:18.317
no sign of abating.

00:10:18.384 --> 00:10:20.152
In fact it could become more

00:10:20.219 --> 00:10:23.923
extreme with changes in a high

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:25.891
and robotics and other --

00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.626
Item on the nation --

00:10:27.693 --> 00:10:29.929
That is likely to to do what

00:10:29.996 --> 00:10:30.463
we're likely to see in our

00:10:30.529 --> 00:10:34.033
economy with a large public

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.002
higher education system is quite

00:10:36.068 --> 00:10:37.903
a challenge --

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:39.872
In being responsive to what the

00:10:39.939 --> 00:10:42.008
work force and requires for the

00:10:42.074 --> 00:10:43.809
future and also being responsive

00:10:43.876 --> 00:10:44.377
to student needs because the

00:10:44.443 --> 00:10:46.112
future of labor force in

00:10:46.178 --> 00:10:47.980
California.

00:10:48.047 --> 00:10:49.882
Is comprised of workers that are

00:10:49.949 --> 00:10:50.449
much more diverse than the

00:10:50.516 --> 00:10:51.884
current labor force --

00:10:51.951 --> 00:10:54.120
And from groups that have

00:10:54.186 --> 00:10:56.188
typically historically --

00:10:56.255 --> 00:10:58.024
And she to lower levels of

00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:59.925
education beyond high school.

00:10:59.992 --> 00:11:02.428
California has made I would just

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:03.996
say a lot of progress and and

00:11:04.063 --> 00:11:06.032
improving access and college

00:11:06.098 --> 00:11:07.900
attainment for these groups but

00:11:07.967 --> 00:11:09.769
there's still room to improve.

00:11:09.835 --> 00:11:12.071
And I think --

00:11:12.138 --> 00:11:13.973
Community colleges are critical

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.142
to meeting that need because

00:11:16.208 --> 00:11:17.910
they really are the point of

00:11:17.977 --> 00:11:18.511
entry for most Californians

00:11:18.577 --> 00:11:21.881
pursuing education beyond high

00:11:21.947 --> 00:11:23.849
school --

00:11:23.916 --> 00:11:25.951
And they serve about three times

00:11:26.018 --> 00:11:26.585
as many students as the state

00:11:26.652 --> 00:11:28.320
that the CSU and you see systems

00:11:28.387 --> 00:11:29.688
combined.

00:11:29.755 --> 00:11:32.024
If you just look at career

00:11:32.091 --> 00:11:33.859
technical programs this gives

00:11:33.926 --> 00:11:34.527
you a bit of a snapshot of the

00:11:34.593 --> 00:11:36.062
students that are pursuing

00:11:36.128 --> 00:11:37.897
education in that round.

00:11:37.963 --> 00:11:38.497
It's a very diverse group of

00:11:38.564 --> 00:11:40.132
students in terms of their

00:11:40.199 --> 00:11:41.801
ethnic background they tend to

00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:44.103
be low income the majority

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:46.072
anyway --

00:11:46.138 --> 00:11:46.705
And there's a diverse range of

00:11:46.772 --> 00:11:47.873
students --

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.276
Pursuing CT training and and the

00:11:50.342 --> 00:11:51.977
California community college

00:11:52.044 --> 00:11:54.013
system on the average age of the

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.781
student is thirty so we're not

00:11:55.848 --> 00:11:57.750
is that these programs actually

00:11:57.817 --> 00:11:58.250
serve a wide range of

00:11:58.317 --> 00:12:00.052
backgrounds from recent high

00:12:00.119 --> 00:12:01.720
school graduates to stranded

00:12:01.787 --> 00:12:02.388
workers to older workers in need

00:12:02.455 --> 00:12:03.956
of retraining.

00:12:04.023 --> 00:12:06.192
And the train as we know --

00:12:06.258 --> 00:12:08.060
For a wide variety of important

00:12:08.127 --> 00:12:09.762
careers in industry sectors.

00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:12.131
And CT to me is really --

00:12:12.198 --> 00:12:15.835
The workforce needs as you as

00:12:15.901 --> 00:12:18.204
you mentioned in your opening

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:19.939
comments because it is so it is

00:12:20.005 --> 00:12:21.874
really the fastest way. To get

00:12:21.941 --> 00:12:23.742
that training that helps

00:12:23.809 --> 00:12:25.644
students improve their economic

00:12:25.711 --> 00:12:27.746
outcomes and helps our state

00:12:27.813 --> 00:12:29.715
meet its workforce means --

00:12:29.782 --> 00:12:31.550
I would just add that and

00:12:31.617 --> 00:12:32.251
there's now a wealth of research

00:12:32.318 --> 00:12:34.086
evidence on the economic pay off

00:12:34.153 --> 00:12:36.021
to see TV credentials this

00:12:36.088 --> 00:12:39.592
charges shows the wage return

00:12:39.658 --> 00:12:40.159
for students to achieve CT

00:12:40.226 --> 00:12:41.760
credentials --

00:12:41.827 --> 00:12:43.996
In the California system and it

00:12:44.063 --> 00:12:46.065
you know the the kind of pay off

00:12:46.132 --> 00:12:47.800
that they earn --

00:12:47.867 --> 00:12:49.668
In the labor market depends on

00:12:49.735 --> 00:12:50.336
the length of the credential the

00:12:50.402 --> 00:12:52.104
highest from a an associate's

00:12:52.171 --> 00:12:53.839
degree --

00:12:53.906 --> 00:12:55.774
And abating a little bit --

00:12:55.841 --> 00:12:56.408
For shorter term certificates

00:12:56.475 --> 00:12:58.210
that can be earned say less than

00:12:58.277 --> 00:12:59.979
a year but none the less the

00:13:00.045 --> 00:13:00.513
economic returns are still

00:13:00.579 --> 00:13:01.747
positive.

00:13:01.814 --> 00:13:03.816
But the program choice also

00:13:03.883 --> 00:13:06.152
matters a lot if you if you take

00:13:06.218 --> 00:13:08.053
health programs out of this

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.889
calculation you can see that the

00:13:09.955 --> 00:13:11.824
the economic return to students

00:13:11.891 --> 00:13:13.759
is much lower.

00:13:13.826 --> 00:13:14.426
So the choice of the program for

00:13:14.493 --> 00:13:16.362
students almost as important in

00:13:16.428 --> 00:13:19.899
a lot of ways as whether take to

00:13:19.965 --> 00:13:23.869
pursue college training at all.

00:13:23.936 --> 00:13:25.771
And I would commend the to the

00:13:25.838 --> 00:13:26.338
chancellor's office in the

00:13:26.405 --> 00:13:26.906
California community college

00:13:26.972 --> 00:13:28.274
system for making this salary

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.176
information publicly available

00:13:30.242 --> 00:13:30.576
on their website.

00:13:30.643 --> 00:13:32.077
Tools like the salary server

00:13:32.144 --> 00:13:34.180
it's really helpful for students

00:13:34.246 --> 00:13:35.915
to think about what at what this

00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:37.983
training might get them in terms

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:39.752
of labor market opportunities

00:13:39.818 --> 00:13:40.319
it's also of course really

00:13:40.386 --> 00:13:41.987
important for policy makers.

00:13:42.054 --> 00:13:42.288
Who are --

00:13:42.354 --> 00:13:43.889
Looking to assess the

00:13:43.956 --> 00:13:45.991
effectiveness of investments in

00:13:46.058 --> 00:13:47.793
CT.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.762
But when I look at those numbers --

00:13:49.828 --> 00:13:52.164
Programs against each other in

00:13:52.231 --> 00:13:54.133
terms of their just kind of

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.968
before after return on

00:13:56.035 --> 00:13:56.268
investment.

00:13:56.335 --> 00:13:58.270
Because of what really we need

00:13:58.337 --> 00:14:00.005
to think about are improving

00:14:00.072 --> 00:14:02.007
long term economic outcomes and

00:14:02.074 --> 00:14:03.976
mobility for students and and

00:14:04.043 --> 00:14:05.778
workers in California and

00:14:05.844 --> 00:14:07.746
there's actually many pathways.

00:14:07.813 --> 00:14:08.414
That can take students to better

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.915
career outcomes.

00:14:09.982 --> 00:14:12.084
In our research at PP I see

00:14:12.151 --> 00:14:14.053
we've looked at how students

00:14:14.119 --> 00:14:16.121
staff credentials so a lot of

00:14:16.188 --> 00:14:17.957
students actually start --

00:14:18.023 --> 00:14:19.925
By earning a short term

00:14:19.992 --> 00:14:20.593
certificate that can be and in

00:14:20.659 --> 00:14:22.394
less than a year that was the

00:14:22.461 --> 00:14:24.296
lowest wage return that you saw

00:14:24.363 --> 00:14:25.898
on the previous charts.

00:14:25.965 --> 00:14:27.967
A lot of students start their

00:14:28.033 --> 00:14:30.469
but some of those who --

00:14:30.536 --> 00:14:31.904
Stack a credential on top of

00:14:31.971 --> 00:14:33.939
that eventually catch up --

00:14:34.006 --> 00:14:34.573
To students who start with the

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.108
higher values a associates

00:14:36.175 --> 00:14:39.812
degree the that's the good news

00:14:39.878 --> 00:14:40.446
the the challenges that not a

00:14:40.512 --> 00:14:41.814
lot of students actually do that

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.016
and not a lot of programs seem

00:14:44.083 --> 00:14:44.650
to be set up to intentionally

00:14:44.717 --> 00:14:46.352
help students move along a clear

00:14:46.418 --> 00:14:46.619
pathway.

00:14:46.685 --> 00:14:48.287
But that's an active area that

00:14:48.354 --> 00:14:50.022
the colleges are working on I

00:14:50.089 --> 00:14:51.924
wanted -- To

00:14:51.991 --> 00:14:53.826
conclude with this chart that

00:14:53.892 --> 00:14:55.861
shows that there are.

00:14:55.928 --> 00:14:57.663
Many pathways that can take

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:02.067
students from --

00:15:02.134 --> 00:15:04.069
You know kind of a low through

00:15:04.136 --> 00:15:07.873
CT training and looking we

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:08.374
looked at just that --

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.842
Students and health programs

00:15:09.908 --> 00:15:11.910
students you started by earning

00:15:11.977 --> 00:15:13.846
a high value certificate or

00:15:13.912 --> 00:15:15.914
speaks give me a high value --

00:15:15.981 --> 00:15:16.482
Degree lack an associate's

00:15:16.548 --> 00:15:18.150
degree in nursing.

00:15:18.217 --> 00:15:20.152
We see their wages increase of

00:15:20.219 --> 00:15:23.889
rapidly and substantially by

00:15:23.956 --> 00:15:24.556
about three times after learning

00:15:24.623 --> 00:15:25.891
that degree students to start

00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.726
with the lower value credential

00:15:27.793 --> 00:15:28.394
like a short term certificate if

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.162
they continue on that career

00:15:30.229 --> 00:15:31.997
pathway.

00:15:32.064 --> 00:15:32.598
That bottom line eventually

00:15:32.665 --> 00:15:34.466
catches up to the students who

00:15:34.533 --> 00:15:45.144
started on a different pathway

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:47.913
so I just wanted to reinforce

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:51.684
this point there are many.

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:54.053
Ways students can I'm.

00:15:54.119 --> 00:15:56.221
Konami billeting program.

00:15:56.288 --> 00:15:58.123
Sign them do that.

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:00.092
Really active way --

00:16:00.159 --> 00:16:02.261
Prove upward mobility in

00:16:02.328 --> 00:16:03.829
California and just in closing --

00:16:03.896 --> 00:16:04.396
I would reiterate that --

00:16:04.463 --> 00:16:06.365
These state investments in CT

00:16:06.432 --> 00:16:07.733
clearly have benefits for

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.334
students but that benefit is

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.269
contingent on our programs being

00:16:10.336 --> 00:16:10.903
geared towards meeting workforce

00:16:10.969 --> 00:16:12.237
needs of the future so the

00:16:12.304 --> 00:16:12.838
partnership with business is

00:16:12.905 --> 00:16:13.839
really critical --

00:16:13.906 --> 00:16:14.340
In ensuring that state

00:16:14.406 --> 00:16:15.874
investments and students

00:16:15.941 --> 00:16:17.710
investments of time --

00:16:17.776 --> 00:16:19.712
Really pay off in terms of

00:16:19.778 --> 00:16:21.814
expanding economic outcomes

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:22.114
[inaudible]

00:16:22.181 --> 00:16:25.651
Thank you much.

00:16:25.718 --> 00:16:27.786
You mentioned --

00:16:27.853 --> 00:16:29.621
The that there are several

00:16:29.688 --> 00:16:31.757
pathways rate that students take.

00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:34.159
On are those recommended by the

00:16:34.226 --> 00:16:36.028
community college or did you

00:16:36.095 --> 00:16:38.497
just find that the students just

00:16:38.564 --> 00:16:41.800
kind of made their way through.

00:16:41.867 --> 00:16:43.769
These pathways.

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:44.236
It out on their own.

00:16:44.303 --> 00:16:45.904
That's a great question so what

00:16:45.971 --> 00:16:47.906
we've done is to try to look

00:16:47.973 --> 00:16:48.474
across the system and what

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.242
pathways are offered and there's

00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:51.877
really a wide range across

00:16:51.944 --> 00:16:54.179
colleges even in the same

00:16:54.246 --> 00:16:55.981
similar kind of industry or

00:16:56.048 --> 00:16:57.750
occupational area you see lots

00:16:57.816 --> 00:16:58.384
of different structures for how

00:16:58.450 --> 00:16:59.885
students.

00:16:59.952 --> 00:17:01.653
Might make it through a program

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:02.321
and this is an active area where

00:17:02.388 --> 00:17:04.123
colleges are trying to create

00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:15.367
better pathways through the

00:17:15.434 --> 00:17:17.936
guided pathways movement in

00:17:18.003 --> 00:17:20.205
strong work for the best.

00:17:20.272 --> 00:17:21.774
So I would say that you know

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:23.876
will probably likely to see and

00:17:23.942 --> 00:17:24.076
how.

00:17:24.143 --> 00:17:26.011
Who is our does?

00:17:26.078 --> 00:17:26.612
You know that there are some

00:17:26.678 --> 00:17:27.980
really stand out clearly lay out

00:17:28.046 --> 00:17:28.514
a career progression for

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:29.948
students and what courses they

00:17:30.015 --> 00:17:31.917
need to take what credentials

00:17:31.984 --> 00:17:32.284
they'll earn.

00:17:32.351 --> 00:17:33.886
And in other cases it's kind of

00:17:33.952 --> 00:17:34.486
looks like a choose your own

00:17:34.553 --> 00:17:35.053
adventure and you see that

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:35.854
reflected in what students

00:17:35.921 --> 00:17:36.555
actually do so we looked at what

00:17:36.622 --> 00:17:37.723
students have done over the last

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:38.157
ten fifteen years.

00:17:38.223 --> 00:17:42.060
And the combinations of prevents

00:17:42.127 --> 00:17:43.796
that they are in our you know

00:17:43.862 --> 00:17:44.296
the kind of across.

00:17:44.363 --> 00:17:46.298
Quite a range of what they

00:17:46.365 --> 00:17:46.598
combine --

00:17:46.665 --> 00:17:47.966
Both in terms of kind of looking

00:17:48.033 --> 00:17:49.902
like it's related to upward

00:17:49.968 --> 00:17:52.171
mobility are up I'd upward

00:17:52.237 --> 00:17:53.906
career progression or not --

00:17:53.972 --> 00:17:55.908
And so I think there's a lot of

00:17:55.974 --> 00:17:56.508
room for improvement there we

00:17:56.575 --> 00:17:58.043
found that students who programs

00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.711
I should say --

00:17:59.778 --> 00:18:01.980
That are a really ext with a

00:18:02.047 --> 00:18:03.715
career progression --

00:18:03.782 --> 00:18:06.118
Improve student outcomes to a

00:18:06.185 --> 00:18:07.853
very large extent --

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.189
I think the exact percentage was

00:18:10.255 --> 00:18:12.391
about you know they improve the

00:18:12.458 --> 00:18:14.426
students odds of completing a

00:18:14.493 --> 00:18:18.063
second degree by about 16% which

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:18.764
is really large in this round --

00:18:18.831 --> 00:18:20.265
So there's a lot of promise

00:18:20.332 --> 00:18:21.867
there to improve.

00:18:21.934 --> 00:18:23.702
And the script pathway programs

00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:24.002
[inaudible]

00:18:24.069 --> 00:18:25.771
Thank you.

00:18:25.838 --> 00:18:27.673
And when you look at when you

00:18:27.739 --> 00:18:28.240
look at the opportunity of

00:18:28.307 --> 00:18:29.942
putting public and private

00:18:30.008 --> 00:18:30.576
putting the community colleges

00:18:30.642 --> 00:18:32.110
together with some of the

00:18:32.177 --> 00:18:34.112
industry's or actually specific

00:18:34.179 --> 00:18:36.048
companies where do you see the

00:18:36.114 --> 00:18:36.415
possibility --

00:18:36.482 --> 00:18:37.950
For collaboration --

00:18:38.016 --> 00:18:40.085
That we haven't taken advantage

00:18:40.152 --> 00:18:41.753
of so much yet.

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:42.387
That's a great question which I

00:18:42.454 --> 00:18:44.122
actually would like to know the

00:18:44.189 --> 00:18:45.824
answer to but don't I I'm hoping

00:18:45.891 --> 00:18:46.458
that some of the other panels

00:18:46.525 --> 00:18:48.026
might address that as well.

00:18:48.093 --> 00:18:50.295
And you know we we see what we

00:18:50.362 --> 00:18:50.963
want to you looks kind of to get

00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:52.231
the state wide picture of what's

00:18:52.297 --> 00:18:54.233
offered.

00:18:54.299 --> 00:18:55.934
And your range of apprentices

00:18:56.001 --> 00:18:57.803
apprenticeship programs in

00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:59.938
credential --

00:19:00.005 --> 00:19:00.672
Geared toward certain industries --

00:19:00.739 --> 00:19:03.976
But we didn't look we we work on

00:19:04.042 --> 00:19:04.510
the ground enough to know

00:19:04.576 --> 00:19:08.180
exactly kind of the potential

00:19:08.247 --> 00:19:09.848
for them for what.

00:19:09.915 --> 00:19:12.050
Great thank you that was I mean

00:19:12.117 --> 00:19:13.785
yanking pages out of your

00:19:13.852 --> 00:19:15.721
presentation keep for later when

00:19:15.787 --> 00:19:18.056
I quote them hopefully and

00:19:18.123 --> 00:19:19.725
committee sometime.

00:19:19.791 --> 00:19:20.325
Thank you for being here thank

00:19:20.392 --> 00:19:25.764
you [inaudible]

00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:27.699
That.

00:19:27.766 --> 00:19:29.902
All right well now have our

00:19:29.968 --> 00:19:33.805
second panel come forward.

00:19:33.872 --> 00:19:37.709
Justin a carrying Christos and

00:19:37.776 --> 00:19:39.878
doctor almost laws are jandal

00:19:39.945 --> 00:19:45.817
internet [inaudible]

00:19:45.884 --> 00:19:59.798
The five and Mister Dawson if

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:21.587
you'll start [inaudible]

00:20:21.653 --> 00:20:21.687
Right.

00:20:21.687 --> 00:20:27.593
Yes okay well first of all you --

00:20:27.659 --> 00:20:28.260
For inviting us to this event is

00:20:28.327 --> 00:20:29.695
a great event of the time is

00:20:29.761 --> 00:20:30.162
perfect for chevron.

00:20:30.228 --> 00:20:31.763
And a lot of passion here --

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:33.899
But just for introduction first

00:20:33.966 --> 00:20:34.566
also then whichever for eighteen

00:20:34.633 --> 00:20:35.934
years --

00:20:36.001 --> 00:20:37.869
Started a shovel in the year two

00:20:37.936 --> 00:20:38.537
thousand in operations the exact

00:20:38.604 --> 00:20:41.840
type of workforce that.

00:20:41.907 --> 00:20:43.642
Cash around trying to develop

00:20:43.709 --> 00:20:45.944
our needs for so having this

00:20:46.011 --> 00:20:47.946
year right now is a to have some

00:20:48.013 --> 00:20:53.952
conversation about it and how we

00:20:54.019 --> 00:20:57.623
can board --

00:20:57.689 --> 00:21:01.827
What about the first lights

00:21:01.893 --> 00:21:02.127
[inaudible]

00:21:02.194 --> 00:21:03.762
See.

00:21:03.829 --> 00:21:06.064
Took a little bit about our

00:21:06.131 --> 00:21:07.766
Democrat press seven enough

00:21:07.833 --> 00:21:08.100
again does --

00:21:08.166 --> 00:21:09.635
Just briefly before I really

00:21:09.701 --> 00:21:10.235
dive into where our needs are

00:21:10.302 --> 00:21:12.104
with operations training program.

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:12.738
And where we see our needs are

00:21:12.804 --> 00:21:13.905
for the future --

00:21:13.972 --> 00:21:15.841
Just briefly a total

00:21:15.907 --> 00:21:16.208
compensation --

00:21:16.274 --> 00:21:17.809
For all of our employees in two

00:21:17.876 --> 00:21:20.045
thousand sixteen was measured at

00:21:20.112 --> 00:21:20.579
a hundred and eighty eight

00:21:20.646 --> 00:21:21.813
million --

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.016
Average hourly wages --

00:21:24.082 --> 00:21:26.151
For full time operations a main

00:21:26.218 --> 00:21:26.385
supply.

00:21:26.451 --> 00:21:27.819
Route forty dollars per hour.

00:21:27.886 --> 00:21:30.222
And that's it does not including

00:21:30.288 --> 00:21:31.823
you know average of 17% of

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:33.892
annual overtime payment

00:21:33.959 --> 00:21:34.493
contractor wages we typically

00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:35.894
bring in roughly around --

00:21:35.961 --> 00:21:37.796
Four to five hundred routine

00:21:37.863 --> 00:21:38.296
contractors per year.

00:21:38.363 --> 00:21:40.232
Averaging around the forty to

00:21:40.298 --> 00:21:42.000
forty five dollars per hour --

00:21:42.067 --> 00:21:42.234
Of rate.

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:50.075
And and a snapshot of what I

00:21:50.142 --> 00:21:51.977
diversity --

00:21:52.044 --> 00:21:53.812
Of us --

00:21:53.879 --> 00:21:54.446
Plate looks like over seven US

00:21:54.513 --> 00:21:55.981
agenda --

00:21:56.048 --> 00:21:59.651
Gender male to female ratio 85%

00:21:59.718 --> 00:22:01.853
215% -- The

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:08.493
generation --

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.862
Played. Three to twelve

00:22:10.929 --> 00:22:11.563
millennials born in eighty eight

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:14.433
the Chen x.'ers fortunate --

00:22:14.499 --> 00:22:15.033
Thirty nine in the baby boomer

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:15.333
generation.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:19.004
And then you see where Reyes

00:22:19.071 --> 00:22:20.405
plays --

00:22:20.472 --> 00:22:22.407
We're races at as far as

00:22:22.474 --> 00:22:24.776
adversity 51% white. 10% --

00:22:24.843 --> 00:22:27.012
Asian 27% Hispanic and a percent --

00:22:27.079 --> 00:22:32.651
African American.

00:22:32.718 --> 00:22:33.251
Someone non visible diversity

00:22:33.318 --> 00:22:36.621
statistics --

00:22:36.688 --> 00:22:40.459
Pretty darn it leads us.

00:22:40.525 --> 00:22:40.959
Spaces for education is

00:22:41.026 --> 00:22:42.360
concerned 27%.

00:22:42.427 --> 00:22:44.696
Of our workforce are actually

00:22:44.763 --> 00:22:46.364
high school graduates --

00:22:46.431 --> 00:22:48.433
28% -- Come

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.435
out with a degree or some sort

00:22:50.502 --> 00:22:52.237
of occasional degree war where

00:22:52.304 --> 00:22:56.408
27% example.

00:22:56.475 --> 00:22:56.975
We're pretty pretty equally

00:22:57.042 --> 00:22:58.577
space there.

00:22:58.643 --> 00:23:02.380
Our persist reading program --

00:23:02.447 --> 00:23:04.750
SO four seven also gonna

00:23:04.816 --> 00:23:06.284
operations remember pretty open

00:23:06.351 --> 00:23:08.220
application process.

00:23:08.286 --> 00:23:08.787
All of our training is done

00:23:08.854 --> 00:23:10.355
internally.

00:23:10.422 --> 00:23:12.190
It's all done in house --

00:23:12.257 --> 00:23:14.092
Where we will like to target

00:23:14.159 --> 00:23:16.194
however is from P. tech

00:23:16.261 --> 00:23:16.762
institutions that are in our

00:23:16.828 --> 00:23:18.230
surrounding area?

00:23:18.296 --> 00:23:18.830
And when I see the timing is

00:23:18.897 --> 00:23:20.465
perfect because right now we're

00:23:20.532 --> 00:23:22.267
on a actual learning journey to

00:23:22.334 --> 00:23:24.436
understand exactly what's.

00:23:24.503 --> 00:23:25.003
Happening in our surrounding

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:26.438
communities.

00:23:26.505 --> 00:23:27.105
What committee colleges actually

00:23:27.172 --> 00:23:28.640
offer P. tech programs what

00:23:28.707 --> 00:23:30.442
their programs look like --

00:23:30.509 --> 00:23:32.410
How successful are there --

00:23:32.477 --> 00:23:33.078
What's your student demographics

00:23:33.145 --> 00:23:34.312
of like --

00:23:34.379 --> 00:23:34.913
We had a great opportunity to

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:36.748
visit a couple of different

00:23:36.815 --> 00:23:38.416
purposes over the last month so.

00:23:38.483 --> 00:23:42.721
That that that the timing is

00:23:42.788 --> 00:23:46.391
right right now area and also --

00:23:46.458 --> 00:23:46.958
Coastline community college

00:23:47.025 --> 00:23:48.493
which is actually an Orange

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:48.727
County.

00:23:48.794 --> 00:23:50.428
What we would like to do going

00:23:50.495 --> 00:23:52.330
forward is to understand what

00:23:52.397 --> 00:23:52.898
additional campuses in the

00:23:52.964 --> 00:23:54.466
nearby areas?

00:23:54.533 --> 00:23:56.268
That you know reflect the our

00:23:56.334 --> 00:23:58.436
surrounding communities that we

00:23:58.503 --> 00:24:00.272
can also leverage your P. tech

00:24:00.338 --> 00:24:02.607
programs offer for bring it into

00:24:02.674 --> 00:24:06.411
more skillful workforce to shop

00:24:06.478 --> 00:24:10.415
and also get the our application

00:24:10.482 --> 00:24:11.016
process is pretty linking.

00:24:11.082 --> 00:24:12.350
You know us about six months --

00:24:12.417 --> 00:24:14.186
That's from the time from

00:24:14.252 --> 00:24:16.488
applying for jobs. To actually

00:24:16.555 --> 00:24:17.088
stepping foot into the door

00:24:17.155 --> 00:24:18.523
right so it's a pretty lengthy

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:20.192
process we have a two month

00:24:20.258 --> 00:24:22.460
orientation including a two

00:24:22.527 --> 00:24:24.362
month -- As

00:24:24.429 --> 00:24:26.364
I to what orientation which

00:24:26.431 --> 00:24:28.300
includes basic operator training

00:24:28.366 --> 00:24:28.934
and then you have a two month.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.602
You know jobs fifty specific

00:24:30.669 --> 00:24:32.404
training program so if you look

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:32.637
at it.

00:24:32.704 --> 00:24:33.238
All together is about a ten

00:24:33.305 --> 00:24:46.718
month term of process is pretty

00:24:46.785 --> 00:24:47.085
pretty lengthy.

00:24:47.152 --> 00:24:47.919
What we're gonna do really is

00:24:47.986 --> 00:24:49.221
looking a little more efficient

00:24:49.287 --> 00:24:50.322
with a Cup time?

00:24:50.388 --> 00:24:54.593
How can we leverage what P. tech

00:24:54.659 --> 00:24:56.394
from offering so that we're

00:24:56.461 --> 00:24:58.196
doing so much and have?

00:24:58.263 --> 00:25:02.367
And we're not [inaudible]

00:25:02.434 --> 00:25:04.369
Work [inaudible]

00:25:04.436 --> 00:25:06.338
For you know.

00:25:06.404 --> 00:25:06.938
We don't know too much about

00:25:07.005 --> 00:25:08.406
what the totals offering from

00:25:08.473 --> 00:25:10.542
community colleges so that's the

00:25:10.609 --> 00:25:11.142
reason why we're on a learning

00:25:11.209 --> 00:25:14.246
to any right now --

00:25:14.312 --> 00:25:14.846
Our needs are truly based off

00:25:14.913 --> 00:25:18.383
you know able to target.

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:20.452
A more skilled --

00:25:20.518 --> 00:25:22.687
Workforce by leveraging what

00:25:22.754 --> 00:25:24.155
Peter programs could offer us

00:25:24.222 --> 00:25:26.458
want to reduce the timeline.

00:25:26.524 --> 00:25:27.125
That it that it takes to bring

00:25:27.192 --> 00:25:28.326
somebody actually into.

00:25:28.393 --> 00:25:30.462
The workforce and being --

00:25:30.528 --> 00:25:30.762
You know --

00:25:30.829 --> 00:25:32.430
A productive employee and also

00:25:32.497 --> 00:25:34.666
at the same time decrease

00:25:34.733 --> 00:25:36.468
employee turnover by targeting

00:25:36.534 --> 00:25:38.403
those who actually want to be in

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:40.438
the P. tech industry P. tech

00:25:40.505 --> 00:25:40.705
meeting.

00:25:40.772 --> 00:25:42.507
Process together process

00:25:42.574 --> 00:25:44.242
technology.

00:25:44.309 --> 00:25:46.711
Also we're seeing is as far as

00:25:46.778 --> 00:25:48.580
in is a shift in --

00:25:48.647 --> 00:25:50.115
I guess for lack of better words

00:25:50.181 --> 00:25:50.548
generations right.

00:25:50.615 --> 00:25:52.617
A large portion of our workforce

00:25:52.684 --> 00:25:54.586
right now or senior employees

00:25:54.653 --> 00:25:56.554
and as they you know retire on

00:25:56.621 --> 00:25:58.423
out with it you know normal

00:25:58.490 --> 00:25:58.723
attrition.

00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:00.325
We have a big gap between those

00:26:00.392 --> 00:26:00.825
employees and the newer

00:26:00.892 --> 00:26:02.560
employees that were bringing in.

00:26:02.627 --> 00:26:04.296
So our customer demand is

00:26:04.362 --> 00:26:06.398
getting a little bit stronger

00:26:06.464 --> 00:26:08.199
although the numbers are.

00:26:08.266 --> 00:26:10.302
Growing substantially you're

00:26:10.368 --> 00:26:12.304
staying around the same.

00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:12.871
Twenty to thirty annually.

00:26:12.938 --> 00:26:14.506
But as we're losing our senior

00:26:14.572 --> 00:26:16.541
staff that that ranging between

00:26:16.608 --> 00:26:18.543
of skilled workforce or

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:20.345
experience in our workforce is

00:26:20.412 --> 00:26:22.314
dropping significant.

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:22.480
So.

00:26:22.547 --> 00:26:23.114
That's a big reason why we need

00:26:23.181 --> 00:26:26.418
to bring in a workforce that

00:26:26.484 --> 00:26:27.085
more skilled coming in so that

00:26:27.152 --> 00:26:28.286
they can.

00:26:28.353 --> 00:26:30.388
Become more productive quicker --

00:26:30.455 --> 00:26:32.223
For future.

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:34.793
You know for several we want to

00:26:34.859 --> 00:26:35.293
increase the visibility

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:36.895
evaluation of P. tech program so

00:26:36.962 --> 00:26:38.763
hopefully you know with --

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:40.298
Increasing the conversations

00:26:40.365 --> 00:26:42.434
with us and groups like this and

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:43.068
most of all the with the South

00:26:43.134 --> 00:26:44.502
Bay with we can continue to do

00:26:44.569 --> 00:26:46.438
that --

00:26:46.504 --> 00:26:48.440
Partner with committee because

00:26:48.506 --> 00:26:49.107
to help develop a bigger talent

00:26:49.174 --> 00:26:52.344
pool and maybe even.

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:52.911
Play a role in how they're

00:26:52.978 --> 00:26:54.713
programs actually developed and

00:26:54.779 --> 00:26:55.213
how the programs can be

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.548
successful.

00:26:56.614 --> 00:26:58.450
And then just continue to

00:26:58.516 --> 00:27:00.518
partner with those workers is to

00:27:00.585 --> 00:27:01.152
keep them never bring going for

00:27:01.219 --> 00:27:08.259
so. Seven my last question.

00:27:08.326 --> 00:27:10.795
I was so late to the and to ask

00:27:10.862 --> 00:27:11.096
a question.

00:27:11.162 --> 00:27:12.530
Well I do have a quick question

00:27:12.597 --> 00:27:13.164
because it also everyone can

00:27:13.231 --> 00:27:16.434
answer this question so fast you

00:27:16.501 --> 00:27:17.102
know the rest of you you all can

00:27:17.168 --> 00:27:18.269
answer Sir --

00:27:18.336 --> 00:27:18.870
Still I am we are trying to

00:27:18.937 --> 00:27:20.338
figure out actually actively

00:27:20.405 --> 00:27:20.905
trying to figure out how to

00:27:20.972 --> 00:27:21.539
create that connection between

00:27:21.606 --> 00:27:22.374
the community colleges and

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.142
private industry and so my

00:27:24.209 --> 00:27:26.211
question to you would be as

00:27:26.277 --> 00:27:26.778
someone in that process.

00:27:26.845 --> 00:27:28.680
What would make it easier for

00:27:28.747 --> 00:27:30.515
you to make that connection

00:27:30.582 --> 00:27:31.149
between call just to make sure

00:27:31.216 --> 00:27:34.352
that they are actually preparing?

00:27:34.419 --> 00:27:36.121
Folks for your industry.

00:27:36.187 --> 00:27:38.223
What what would actually make it

00:27:38.289 --> 00:27:40.191
easier to make that transition

00:27:40.258 --> 00:27:40.792
to working with the community

00:27:40.859 --> 00:27:42.660
colleges from my perspective but

00:27:42.727 --> 00:27:44.329
they will make it easier?

00:27:44.396 --> 00:27:44.896
If we had a better conduit.

00:27:44.963 --> 00:27:48.199
Between us and knowing exactly

00:27:48.266 --> 00:27:48.633
what's out there --

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:50.502
Right now even though I visited

00:27:50.568 --> 00:27:52.570
three different campuses of the

00:27:52.637 --> 00:27:54.272
last couple of months.

00:27:54.339 --> 00:27:58.109
It was --

00:27:58.176 --> 00:28:00.445
Was colleges a taken to side

00:28:00.512 --> 00:28:02.213
right type labor group really

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:02.847
didn't know exactly who was out

00:28:02.914 --> 00:28:04.249
there what campuses are out

00:28:04.315 --> 00:28:04.482
there.

00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:06.251
Won't even by the ones that we

00:28:06.317 --> 00:28:08.420
knew of had just by word of

00:28:08.486 --> 00:28:09.020
mouth but if we had a actual

00:28:09.087 --> 00:28:10.655
stable proper conduct.

00:28:10.722 --> 00:28:12.223
That can tell the tape you know

00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:12.690
so we just college --

00:28:12.757 --> 00:28:14.426
Camino college --

00:28:14.492 --> 00:28:20.331
Ellie Harper college right --

00:28:20.398 --> 00:28:22.367
That we can draw from.

00:28:22.434 --> 00:28:24.702
And they're successful that'll

00:28:24.769 --> 00:28:26.304
be a big game changer for us.

00:28:26.371 --> 00:28:26.771
Thank you [inaudible]

00:28:26.838 --> 00:28:28.373
That.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.575
But then I would one piggy back

00:28:30.642 --> 00:28:31.176
on that I absolutely agree I

00:28:31.242 --> 00:28:32.177
think having.

00:28:32.243 --> 00:28:34.245
A better conduit and

00:28:34.312 --> 00:28:34.813
intermediary that can help

00:28:34.879 --> 00:28:36.414
facilitate those business

00:28:36.481 --> 00:28:38.283
education partnerships --

00:28:38.349 --> 00:28:40.485
I think regional business

00:28:40.552 --> 00:28:42.387
organizations are starting to

00:28:42.454 --> 00:28:43.054
play a critical role in this --

00:28:43.121 --> 00:28:46.491
In this regard I often joke that --

00:28:46.558 --> 00:28:48.293
And I'm trying legal I speak

00:28:48.359 --> 00:28:50.328
business education and workforce

00:28:50.395 --> 00:28:52.297
Senate and acquired skill set.

00:28:52.363 --> 00:28:54.499
And sometimes the educators on

00:28:54.566 --> 00:28:56.367
the ground are so intent and

00:28:56.434 --> 00:28:58.303
their primary focus that being

00:28:58.369 --> 00:28:58.937
able to do that code switching

00:28:59.003 --> 00:29:00.438
where they can directly

00:29:00.505 --> 00:29:02.273
interface with employers or

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:04.576
really understand their names --

00:29:04.642 --> 00:29:06.711
Is sometimes daunting and

00:29:06.778 --> 00:29:08.379
difficult as well as trying to

00:29:08.446 --> 00:29:10.582
more deeply a line the systems

00:29:10.648 --> 00:29:16.521
in in a way in which I mean they

00:29:16.588 --> 00:29:18.389
and they funds we're ready to

00:29:18.456 --> 00:29:20.158
engage that means.

00:29:20.225 --> 00:29:22.293
Today tomorrow within the next

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:22.894
week or systems don't always

00:29:22.961 --> 00:29:24.496
aren't always as nimble and

00:29:24.562 --> 00:29:26.564
ready to respond --

00:29:26.631 --> 00:29:28.466
To the degree that are employers

00:29:28.533 --> 00:29:30.235
are ready to engage to somehow

00:29:30.301 --> 00:29:30.802
if we can incentivize those

00:29:30.869 --> 00:29:32.504
types of behavior which I think.

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:34.739
We've done a superb job in over.

00:29:34.806 --> 00:29:36.708
Several of pieces of legislation

00:29:36.774 --> 00:29:38.676
last couple years I've tried to

00:29:38.743 --> 00:29:40.678
elicit these types a B. average

00:29:40.745 --> 00:29:42.547
per systems I think would be

00:29:42.614 --> 00:29:44.349
much further along [inaudible]

00:29:44.415 --> 00:29:48.453
Contract but thank you work in

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.355
progress [inaudible]

00:29:50.421 --> 00:29:52.090
That's where.

00:29:52.157 --> 00:29:56.261
Justin I do want to go --

00:29:56.327 --> 00:30:09.073
Is like a centers of it's are

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:09.674
next panelist is Justina the

00:30:09.741 --> 00:30:10.175
Cooley Cooper okay I'm

00:30:10.241 --> 00:30:10.675
recruiting director for

00:30:10.742 --> 00:30:12.477
manufacturing a production at

00:30:12.544 --> 00:30:18.149
face at as well K..

00:30:18.216 --> 00:30:20.318
Yes my name.

00:30:20.385 --> 00:30:22.520
I and the recruiting manager

00:30:22.587 --> 00:30:24.856
asking sacks for manufacturing

00:30:24.923 --> 00:30:25.456
production for all our product

00:30:25.523 --> 00:30:26.391
lines --

00:30:26.457 --> 00:30:30.228
Today I'd like to discuss

00:30:30.295 --> 00:30:30.528
[inaudible]

00:30:30.595 --> 00:30:32.163
Thank you.

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:36.134
At sixty six in general was

00:30:36.201 --> 00:30:36.801
founded in two thousand its you

00:30:36.868 --> 00:30:38.469
by can one mosque --

00:30:38.536 --> 00:30:40.271
Currently as we stand today were

00:30:40.338 --> 00:30:40.939
about six thousand employees we

00:30:41.005 --> 00:30:42.407
have about twelve billion

00:30:42.473 --> 00:30:43.041
dollars in business contracts

00:30:43.107 --> 00:30:44.509
and we've had sixty five

00:30:44.576 --> 00:30:46.511
successful flights so that's a

00:30:46.578 --> 00:30:48.213
really exciting time for us as

00:30:48.279 --> 00:30:50.348
we are growing. For such a young

00:30:50.415 --> 00:30:50.949
organization compared to our

00:30:51.015 --> 00:30:52.383
members --

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:54.652
Currently we have a few vehicles

00:30:54.719 --> 00:30:55.320
that were launching right now so

00:30:55.386 --> 00:30:56.387
we have our falcon.

00:30:56.454 --> 00:30:58.489
Nine falcon heavy cargo driving

00:30:58.556 --> 00:31:02.160
and soon to be pre dragon and

00:31:02.227 --> 00:31:04.329
that will be for manned flight.

00:31:04.395 --> 00:31:06.431
Falcon nine has been

00:31:06.497 --> 00:31:08.399
successfully launched sixty two

00:31:08.466 --> 00:31:10.168
again it's been an incredible

00:31:10.235 --> 00:31:12.237
feat for us just because it was

00:31:12.303 --> 00:31:12.770
a historic moment in two

00:31:12.837 --> 00:31:14.739
thousand and twelve when we were

00:31:14.806 --> 00:31:16.074
the first commercial spacecraft

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:16.708
to make it to the international

00:31:16.774 --> 00:31:18.509
space station delivering cargo

00:31:18.576 --> 00:31:20.511
and then also bringing cargo

00:31:20.578 --> 00:31:20.712
back.

00:31:20.778 --> 00:31:22.180
Home safely back to earth so

00:31:22.247 --> 00:31:24.482
that has been a huge piece in

00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:24.949
terms of our success.

00:31:25.016 --> 00:31:26.417
Lately --

00:31:26.484 --> 00:31:27.018
The next vehicle that we're

00:31:27.085 --> 00:31:28.620
building right out as you seen

00:31:28.686 --> 00:31:30.788
falcon having made its premiere

00:31:30.855 --> 00:31:32.323
this year.

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:32.890
And it's the world's most

00:31:32.957 --> 00:31:36.227
powerful operational launch

00:31:36.294 --> 00:31:36.494
vehicle.

00:31:36.561 --> 00:31:38.429
Equals approximately eighteen

00:31:38.496 --> 00:31:40.265
seven forty seven aircraft.

00:31:40.331 --> 00:31:40.865
Incredibly powerful and that

00:31:40.932 --> 00:31:44.636
would be to deliver larger

00:31:44.702 --> 00:31:46.638
payloads to orbits. For the next

00:31:46.704 --> 00:31:47.205
couple that were having --

00:31:47.272 --> 00:31:57.849
Is for dragon so for cargo

00:31:57.915 --> 00:32:00.618
tracking we have for flight

00:32:00.685 --> 00:32:00.985
proven mission.

00:32:01.052 --> 00:32:04.322
Except --

00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:06.391
And that it --

00:32:06.457 --> 00:32:08.693
NASA recently announced this

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.428
year that we wine [inaudible]

00:32:10.495 --> 00:32:12.297
Black.

00:32:12.363 --> 00:32:14.399
Now the asset to the

00:32:14.465 --> 00:32:16.234
international space station in

00:32:16.301 --> 00:32:18.202
our were dragon spacecraft.

00:32:18.269 --> 00:32:20.638
At the first. One is gonna be

00:32:20.705 --> 00:32:22.607
inch would June twenty nineteen

00:32:22.674 --> 00:32:24.375
to the I. S. S. and that's gonna

00:32:24.442 --> 00:32:24.709
be !n ma'am.

00:32:24.776 --> 00:32:25.310
From there and then the next

00:32:25.376 --> 00:32:28.446
will be for June twenty nineteen

00:32:28.513 --> 00:32:30.348
for a demo to mission and that

00:32:30.415 --> 00:32:32.383
will be managed with this.

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:34.385
Asheron's and their since the

00:32:34.452 --> 00:32:36.688
beginning of two thousand and

00:32:36.754 --> 00:32:37.355
seventeen physics as represented

00:32:37.422 --> 00:32:38.790
over 60% of all U. S. orbital

00:32:38.856 --> 00:32:40.558
watches with thirty six

00:32:40.625 --> 00:32:42.160
completed mission.

00:32:42.226 --> 00:32:42.694
So far in twenty eighteen

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.696
SpaceX's achieve the fastest

00:32:44.762 --> 00:32:46.497
launching its in its history

00:32:46.564 --> 00:32:47.198
launching more than our domestic

00:32:47.265 --> 00:32:48.466
or international competitors.

00:32:48.533 --> 00:32:50.568
Have lunch with eighteen likes

00:32:50.635 --> 00:32:50.835
so far --

00:32:50.902 --> 00:32:52.770
This year which is huge and we

00:32:52.837 --> 00:32:54.605
have about twenty to plan for

00:32:54.672 --> 00:32:55.206
this year so we have a couple

00:32:55.273 --> 00:32:58.376
more coming out. To date

00:32:58.443 --> 00:33:00.545
SpaceX's this actually landed

00:33:00.611 --> 00:33:00.845
[inaudible]

00:33:00.912 --> 00:33:04.916
Thirty exciting [inaudible]

00:33:04.982 --> 00:33:06.584
From there.

00:33:06.651 --> 00:33:07.251
Sorry because project working on

00:33:07.318 --> 00:33:10.555
next is starship.

00:33:10.621 --> 00:33:11.155
Chau starship is this next

00:33:11.222 --> 00:33:12.690
generation launch system is

00:33:12.757 --> 00:33:14.459
fully reusable.

00:33:14.525 --> 00:33:16.694
And is designed to provide cost

00:33:16.761 --> 00:33:18.262
effective and reliable launch

00:33:18.329 --> 00:33:18.863
services for our customers and

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:20.832
to serve as an interplanetary

00:33:20.898 --> 00:33:22.300
transport system.

00:33:22.367 --> 00:33:24.235
The first opportunity lunch

00:33:24.302 --> 00:33:26.204
cargo mission to Mars is.

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:26.804
Twenty twenty two followed by

00:33:26.871 --> 00:33:30.274
the first crude mission in.

00:33:30.341 --> 00:33:32.276
Twenty twenty four currently

00:33:32.343 --> 00:33:32.844
less than 5% of SpaceX's

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:34.746
resources are currently being

00:33:34.812 --> 00:33:36.481
spent on starship but that will

00:33:36.547 --> 00:33:37.115
change quite significantly with

00:33:37.181 --> 00:33:38.216
the years to come.

00:33:38.282 --> 00:33:40.651
We're looking for top talent in

00:33:40.718 --> 00:33:42.553
those with a passion for mission

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:44.555
SpaceX looks for people who love

00:33:44.622 --> 00:33:46.557
text. To speech challenge the

00:33:46.624 --> 00:33:47.191
status quo and solve problems.

00:33:47.258 --> 00:33:48.593
Like to see strong academics but

00:33:48.659 --> 00:33:50.862
what's equally important to this

00:33:50.928 --> 00:33:52.663
is also.

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:54.532
Individuals getting involved in

00:33:54.599 --> 00:33:56.434
participation groups and clubs

00:33:56.501 --> 00:33:58.236
allow you develop a process

00:33:58.302 --> 00:34:00.638
product goal.

00:34:00.705 --> 00:34:01.272
We want people who worked to

00:34:01.339 --> 00:34:02.573
solve problems and who enjoy

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.575
experimenting with different

00:34:04.642 --> 00:34:06.811
solutions within the team based

00:34:06.878 --> 00:34:08.379
setting.

00:34:08.446 --> 00:34:10.548
Strong and that makes our part

00:34:10.615 --> 00:34:11.215
because you will be making very

00:34:11.282 --> 00:34:12.650
technical decisions at SpaceX so

00:34:12.717 --> 00:34:14.719
what you learn in school will

00:34:14.786 --> 00:34:15.319
apply to you in the juggling

00:34:15.386 --> 00:34:16.554
multiple projects.

00:34:16.621 --> 00:34:18.756
So bounce academics and hands on

00:34:18.823 --> 00:34:20.391
experience is a key for us.

00:34:20.458 --> 00:34:20.958
The work that we do is very

00:34:21.025 --> 00:34:22.493
challenging however it's

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:23.127
incredibly rewarding because we

00:34:23.194 --> 00:34:24.495
are contributing to something

00:34:24.562 --> 00:34:26.297
much larger than ourselves.

00:34:26.364 --> 00:34:28.666
The LA area offers many

00:34:28.733 --> 00:34:29.233
opportunities for a diverse

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:30.601
workforce a recruiting teams

00:34:30.668 --> 00:34:32.236
look all over the country for

00:34:32.303 --> 00:34:32.870
the best and we have hard many

00:34:32.937 --> 00:34:34.672
lovely. For trade school

00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:36.407
specifically where we are

00:34:36.474 --> 00:34:36.908
succeeding are with the

00:34:36.974 --> 00:34:38.643
instructors that have invested

00:34:38.709 --> 00:34:40.812
their time with us so we have

00:34:40.878 --> 00:34:42.313
hiring managers that.

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:42.980
Partner with them to help create

00:34:43.047 --> 00:34:46.617
a curriculum space access --

00:34:46.684 --> 00:34:48.820
For the work that we do.

00:34:48.886 --> 00:34:50.755
We have donated expired

00:34:50.822 --> 00:34:52.356
materials to those schools and

00:34:52.423 --> 00:34:54.292
have hired me right after

00:34:54.358 --> 00:34:54.926
graduation what we seem from

00:34:54.992 --> 00:34:56.494
those individuals they are

00:34:56.561 --> 00:34:58.729
definitely thriving in our

00:34:58.796 --> 00:35:00.431
environment.

00:35:00.498 --> 00:35:00.998
Also see much success with

00:35:01.065 --> 00:35:02.166
individuals with air frame and

00:35:02.233 --> 00:35:04.569
power plant licenses however one

00:35:04.635 --> 00:35:06.337
of the main issues is that can

00:35:06.404 --> 00:35:08.573
make can be quite expensive

00:35:08.639 --> 00:35:09.106
obtaining that license.

00:35:09.173 --> 00:35:12.443
Generally a two year program.

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:14.345
Can cost anywhere from

00:35:14.412 --> 00:35:14.712
200-002-50000.

00:35:14.779 --> 00:35:16.881

00:35:16.948 --> 00:35:18.282
program.

00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:18.883
If there was any way to reduce

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:20.618
the costs we would have a much

00:35:20.685 --> 00:35:22.386
larger candidate pool.

00:35:22.453 --> 00:35:22.954
It's helpful for the state's

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:24.722

00:36:26.851 --> 00:36:28.486
positions we've hired for our

00:36:28.553 --> 00:36:30.388
propulsion technicians --

00:36:30.454 --> 00:36:32.423
Structures technicians

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:34.492
composites technicians and with

00:36:34.559 --> 00:36:35.092
composites it's definitely a

00:36:35.159 --> 00:36:36.561
very specialized skills that in

00:36:36.627 --> 00:36:37.194
terms of the material that we

00:36:37.261 --> 00:36:38.963
use so that's why we decided to

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:40.565
donate those to the schools.

00:36:40.631 --> 00:36:42.533
That has worked out incredibly

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:43.200
well for them to be hands on our

00:36:43.267 --> 00:36:44.802
her managers actually show up on

instructors from there to create

00:36:48.673 --> 00:36:50.274
this program so --

00:36:50.341 --> 00:36:52.443
For the efforts that we've done

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:52.977
locally it's worked out

00:36:53.044 --> 00:36:54.478
incredibly well for us in terms

00:36:54.545 --> 00:36:56.514
of potentially creating an

00:36:56.581 --> 00:36:57.048
apprenticeship program for

00:36:57.114 --> 00:36:58.282
example.

00:36:58.349 --> 00:36:58.883
But for the individuals that

00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:00.618
have worked their income

00:37:00.685 --> 00:37:04.288

00:37:04.355 --> 00:37:06.390
extremely well and I'm I'm in.

00:37:06.457 --> 00:37:06.924
And how did you make that

00:37:06.991 --> 00:37:10.661
decision to do that. To partner

00:37:10.728 --> 00:37:12.229
with the trade schools.

00:37:12.296 --> 00:37:14.665

00:37:14.732 --> 00:37:16.200
force in general at space that

00:37:16.267 --> 00:37:16.867
they actually do come out from a

00:37:16.934 --> 00:37:18.603
lot of the trade schools because

00:37:18.669 --> 00:37:20.271
they have an local to the area

00:37:20.338 --> 00:37:20.438
so.

00:37:20.504 --> 00:37:22.273
Just hearing from word of mouth

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:22.940
of what programs are becoming or

00:37:23.007 --> 00:37:24.508
what courses they've taken I

00:37:24.575 --> 00:37:26.877
just definitely peaked in

00:37:26.944 --> 00:37:28.646
interest in to us to go check

00:37:28.713 --> 00:37:30.281

00:37:46.397 --> 00:37:48.199
could have helped.

00:37:48.265 --> 00:37:50.434
Create that partnership like we

00:37:50.501 --> 00:37:52.236

00:37:52.303 --> 00:37:54.372
I would probably.

00:37:54.438 --> 00:37:56.540
You know is that whether someone

00:37:56.607 --> 00:37:58.542

were able to pass this out to

00:38:17.028 --> 00:38:18.262

So several years ago when we

Around how can we better

00:40:42.239 --> 00:40:42.773
little bit in terms of their

employers much of which came out

00:40:56.787 --> 00:40:58.823

00:40:58.889 --> 00:41:00.324
plan -- But

00:41:00.391 --> 00:41:00.891
I think what it really --

00:41:00.958 --> 00:41:02.660
Lends itself to it's just the

00:41:02.726 --> 00:41:06.363
the continued focus around if

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:06.997

issues as it relates to

00:41:08.699 --> 00:41:10.301
individuals who --

00:41:10.367 --> 00:41:12.670
Have multiple barriers to

00:41:12.736 --> 00:41:14.471
employment we really need to

00:41:14.538 --> 00:41:16.207
ensure that all of our systems.

00:41:16.273 --> 00:41:18.676
All of our partners are growing

00:41:18.742 --> 00:41:20.477
in the same --

00:41:20.544 --> 00:41:22.680
To is who we want to deeply

00:41:22.746 --> 00:41:24.348
engage with --

00:41:24.415 --> 00:41:28.285
When a point to at least --

00:41:28.352 --> 00:41:28.919
For different initiatives that

00:41:28.986 --> 00:41:32.289
have been funded through --

00:41:32.356 --> 00:41:32.957
One of three of which is funded

00:41:33.023 --> 00:41:34.625
through the governor's --

00:41:34.692 --> 00:41:36.427
Discretionary funding and one of

00:41:36.493 --> 00:41:38.596
which which was just codified a

00:41:38.662 --> 00:41:40.531
couple of years ago and where

00:41:40.598 --> 00:41:42.366
there is currently --

00:41:42.433 --> 00:41:44.335
Appropriations going to be

00:41:44.401 --> 00:41:46.670
provided to ensure that we

00:41:46.737 --> 00:41:48.339
continue --

00:41:48.405 --> 00:41:52.476
To focused around this work --

00:41:52.543 --> 00:41:54.712
So the first being the sling

00:41:54.778 --> 00:41:56.313
shot initiative --

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:56.914
Which seeks to collaborative

00:41:56.981 --> 00:41:58.549
efforts between employers

00:41:58.616 --> 00:42:00.384
industry government workforce

00:42:00.451 --> 00:42:02.186
economic development.

00:42:02.253 --> 00:42:04.655
On educational partners within

00:42:04.722 --> 00:42:06.490
the region to identify and solve

00:42:06.557 --> 00:42:08.626
employment challenges --

00:42:08.692 --> 00:42:10.527
In the last --

00:42:10.594 --> 00:42:12.529
Fiscal year the state invested

00:42:12.596 --> 00:42:14.598
six point one million dollars in

00:42:14.665 --> 00:42:16.233
the sling shot initiatives --

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:18.535
Which I know came to the LA

00:42:18.602 --> 00:42:19.203
region a particularly focused on

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:20.537
health care and we've done

00:42:20.604 --> 00:42:22.873
others throughout the state --

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:24.642
That have really done this work

00:42:24.708 --> 00:42:25.209
and I think what it really

00:42:25.276 --> 00:42:28.412
points to and what the resources

00:42:28.479 --> 00:42:30.180
of been for it to really invite

00:42:30.247 --> 00:42:32.750
and a pool for innovation within

00:42:32.816 --> 00:42:34.184
our region --

00:42:34.251 --> 00:42:38.389
And give our our workforce

00:42:38.455 --> 00:42:39.023
development board's and others

00:42:39.089 --> 00:42:40.424
the creativity to start to

00:42:40.491 --> 00:42:42.159
address these issues and to

00:42:42.226 --> 00:42:44.828
really go beyond silos --

00:42:44.895 --> 00:42:46.430
To ensure that we are eliciting

00:42:46.497 --> 00:42:48.565
for some of the best practices --

00:42:48.632 --> 00:42:50.367
So kudos to the state board and

00:42:50.434 --> 00:42:52.336
others who really brought a

00:42:52.403 --> 00:42:54.471
visionary mindset to this and

00:42:54.538 --> 00:42:55.072
have really in many ways.

00:42:55.139 --> 00:42:56.607
I'm use these resources to

00:42:56.674 --> 00:43:00.144
incentivize --

00:43:00.210 --> 00:43:03.080
These innovative behaviors --

00:43:03.147 --> 00:43:03.647
The second is a workforce

00:43:03.714 --> 00:43:04.548
accelerator find --

00:43:04.615 --> 00:43:08.352
And similarly --

00:43:08.419 --> 00:43:08.886
As governor discretionary

00:43:08.953 --> 00:43:10.487
funding.

00:43:10.554 --> 00:43:12.323
Provided six million dollars in

00:43:12.389 --> 00:43:14.792
two and twenty eighteen decks

00:43:14.858 --> 00:43:16.560
that design develop and

00:43:16.627 --> 00:43:18.228
implement and accelerate --

00:43:18.295 --> 00:43:20.698
Employment and reemployment

00:43:20.764 --> 00:43:24.234
strategies of for our our

00:43:24.301 --> 00:43:28.339
hardest to serve job seekers --

00:43:28.405 --> 00:43:29.006
And similarly test for types of

00:43:29.073 --> 00:43:30.474
innovations and solutions that

00:43:30.541 --> 00:43:30.908
try to address --

00:43:30.975 --> 00:43:34.244
These barriers to employment --

00:43:34.311 --> 00:43:36.246
And then lastly --

00:43:36.313 --> 00:43:38.282
Investments in the high road

00:43:38.349 --> 00:43:38.816
training partnerships --

00:43:38.882 --> 00:43:40.617
In these have been focused

00:43:40.684 --> 00:43:42.619
around there been --

00:43:42.686 --> 00:43:43.187
Eight demonstration projects

00:43:43.253 --> 00:43:46.690
that have I'm in this is --

00:43:46.757 --> 00:43:48.525
Uniquely focused around --

00:43:48.592 --> 00:43:50.661
The delivery of equity

00:43:50.728 --> 00:43:54.765
sustainability and job quality

00:43:54.832 --> 00:43:55.099
for again --

00:43:55.165 --> 00:43:56.266
Some of are harder to serve

00:43:56.333 --> 00:43:58.502
populations and ensuring that.

00:43:58.569 --> 00:44:00.471
We are --

00:44:00.537 --> 00:44:04.341
Incentivizing.

00:44:04.408 --> 00:44:04.875
These are implementing the

00:44:04.942 --> 00:44:06.176
strong.

00:44:06.243 --> 00:44:06.844
That have really range of from

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:09.246
transportation to health care

00:44:09.313 --> 00:44:10.581
projects and another efforts --

00:44:10.647 --> 00:44:12.950
So again I am twenty two three

00:44:13.017 --> 00:44:14.718
discrete of funding streams that

00:44:14.785 --> 00:44:16.520
have really sought to engage

00:44:16.587 --> 00:44:18.856
employers resources that are

00:44:18.922 --> 00:44:20.357
available that in many ways

00:44:20.424 --> 00:44:23.027
invites employers to be not only

00:44:23.093 --> 00:44:27.064
the table but help try these

00:44:27.131 --> 00:44:28.599
innovative partnerships.

00:44:28.665 --> 00:44:30.567
Again working across our respect

00:44:30.634 --> 00:44:30.901
silos -- To

00:44:30.968 --> 00:44:32.636
ensure that we're getting a

00:44:32.703 --> 00:44:34.238
higher yield these types of

00:44:34.304 --> 00:44:36.573
investments and really be an

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:37.207
incubator for our some success

00:44:37.274 --> 00:44:38.242
successful --

00:44:38.308 --> 00:44:40.244
Initiatives --

00:44:40.310 --> 00:44:44.348
Lastly all point to AB --

00:44:44.415 --> 00:44:44.948
Eleven eleven this was led by

00:44:45.015 --> 00:44:46.483
the California workforce assist

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:50.287
California workforce association

00:44:50.354 --> 00:44:52.756
NWA -- Was

00:44:52.823 --> 00:44:56.527
codified more than resources for

00:44:56.593 --> 00:44:58.462
A. B. eleven of and and it's a

00:44:58.529 --> 00:45:00.998
fifteen million dollar grant

00:45:01.065 --> 00:45:01.265
program.

00:45:01.331 --> 00:45:02.332
That will --

00:45:02.399 --> 00:45:04.935
Encouraged and community based

00:45:05.002 --> 00:45:06.570
on his agents to work with its

00:45:06.637 --> 00:45:08.238
workforce development board's.

00:45:08.305 --> 00:45:10.707
In --

00:45:10.774 --> 00:45:11.308
Identifying of resources for

00:45:11.375 --> 00:45:12.676
individuals with barriers to

00:45:12.743 --> 00:45:14.445
employment and where we can

00:45:14.511 --> 00:45:16.213
better serve --

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:19.016
These populations --

00:45:19.083 --> 00:45:20.317
There are a series of

00:45:20.384 --> 00:45:22.953
stakeholder meetings that will

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:23.387
be scheduled this.

00:45:23.454 --> 00:45:24.688
I'm with the expectation that

00:45:24.755 --> 00:45:26.824
the request for proposals will

00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:28.392
be made available --

00:45:28.459 --> 00:45:30.561
Next spring so just something to

00:45:30.627 --> 00:45:32.729
keep an eye on in terms of as

00:45:32.796 --> 00:45:34.498
this legislation is forward in

00:45:34.565 --> 00:45:36.333
Nazareth been resources

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:39.002
appropriated what can we glean --

00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:40.637
From these initiatives that can

00:45:40.704 --> 00:45:42.406
that we should then be working.

00:45:42.473 --> 00:45:46.343
Terms of helping to bring the

00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:48.178
scale --

00:45:48.245 --> 00:45:48.745
Create a critical mass of

00:45:48.812 --> 00:45:50.447
opportunities for individuals

00:45:50.514 --> 00:45:50.981
that we need to serve.

00:45:51.048 --> 00:45:52.816
I will also add particularly as

00:45:52.883 --> 00:45:53.150
it relates --

00:45:53.217 --> 00:45:54.551
To workforce accelerator and

00:45:54.618 --> 00:45:56.353
sling shot --

00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:58.422
There has been a pushed around

00:45:58.489 --> 00:46:00.290
how to weave badly we these

00:46:00.357 --> 00:46:04.294
initiatives in trying to glean

00:46:04.361 --> 00:46:04.595
take away.

00:46:04.661 --> 00:46:06.430
Not necessarily assess how well

00:46:06.497 --> 00:46:08.365
they work but what it what is it

00:46:08.432 --> 00:46:08.966
that we can take from this

00:46:09.032 --> 00:46:10.501
particular initiative that then

00:46:10.567 --> 00:46:12.769
we could look towards as pillars

00:46:12.836 --> 00:46:16.607
of effective practices that we

00:46:16.673 --> 00:46:18.142
might want invest.

00:46:18.208 --> 00:46:24.248
So A. Posner happening cost.

00:46:24.314 --> 00:46:26.450
I have a change of the okay a

00:46:26.517 --> 00:46:30.354
question I have a question so

00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:30.954
okay so the money will so.

00:46:31.021 --> 00:46:32.356
I have a couple questions one

00:46:32.422 --> 00:46:34.491
what did the engagement look

00:46:34.558 --> 00:46:35.092
like so I hear the there was

00:46:35.159 --> 00:46:36.426
money allocated to these

00:46:36.493 --> 00:46:38.562
programs one question would be

00:46:38.629 --> 00:46:39.163
why did the engagement with

00:46:39.229 --> 00:46:39.863
employers look like and what was

00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:40.564
the outcome and what was.

00:46:40.631 --> 00:46:44.601
The sort of again passage and

00:46:44.668 --> 00:46:46.336
okay.

00:46:46.403 --> 00:46:48.739
And there was one of the funded

00:46:48.805 --> 00:46:50.541
projects in okay to it with a

00:46:50.607 --> 00:46:52.242
great app.

00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:54.311
So that's made one of that's my

00:46:54.378 --> 00:46:54.811
question is what to the

00:46:54.878 --> 00:46:56.547
engagement look like how they

00:46:56.613 --> 00:46:58.182
were employer how are employers

00:46:58.248 --> 00:46:58.782
found on the city of chevron

00:46:58.849 --> 00:47:00.717
here that want to participate in

00:47:00.784 --> 00:47:01.218
some of these things.

00:47:01.285 --> 00:47:04.354
Well the the the the one that --

00:47:04.421 --> 00:47:06.523
Was referred to was the health

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:08.825
care coordination grant what

00:47:08.892 --> 00:47:12.629
happened together and we did you

00:47:12.696 --> 00:47:14.731
tell us what you need.

00:47:14.798 --> 00:47:15.365
We're gonna tell you what you

00:47:15.432 --> 00:47:18.168
need you tell us what you mean

00:47:18.235 --> 00:47:18.702
what came out was que is

00:47:18.769 --> 00:47:20.137
coordination.

00:47:20.204 --> 00:47:20.437
So -- That

00:47:20.504 --> 00:47:22.706
started a long string of

00:47:22.773 --> 00:47:24.975
discussions and coordination and

00:47:25.042 --> 00:47:26.510
how to do that.

00:47:26.577 --> 00:47:28.612
And we found a couple colleges.

00:47:28.679 --> 00:47:30.514
That were able --

00:47:30.581 --> 00:47:32.549
To this space specifically

00:47:32.616 --> 00:47:34.785
trained for the curriculum that

00:47:34.851 --> 00:47:36.920
the employers wide.

00:47:36.987 --> 00:47:38.555
And we contracted with those --

00:47:38.622 --> 00:47:42.159
Hospitals we had lots of help

00:47:42.226 --> 00:47:44.595
from the hospital association.

00:47:44.661 --> 00:47:46.163
Who survey there --

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:48.532
Members and based on that.

00:47:48.599 --> 00:47:50.300
We've filled up the class and we

00:47:50.367 --> 00:47:52.536
have a waiting list for people

00:47:52.603 --> 00:47:54.204
that want to go into that so it

00:47:54.271 --> 00:47:56.473
took awhile to get. To to get it

00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:58.508
all going but that's how come

00:47:58.575 --> 00:48:00.110
that's how it started.

00:48:00.177 --> 00:48:02.179
We said what do you want they

00:48:02.246 --> 00:48:04.715
told us we contracted with the

00:48:04.781 --> 00:48:05.182
hospital association.

00:48:05.249 --> 00:48:08.352
We set them down with all their

00:48:08.418 --> 00:48:10.153
and their nurse practitioners to

00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:12.356
tell us what to the curriculum

00:48:12.422 --> 00:48:14.224
look like.

00:48:14.291 --> 00:48:14.725
Develop the curriculum.

00:48:14.791 --> 00:48:16.627
And identified those colleges

00:48:16.693 --> 00:48:18.295
that were able to teach.

00:48:18.362 --> 00:48:20.397
And I remember when you do that

00:48:20.464 --> 00:48:22.132
that was last year you started.

00:48:22.199 --> 00:48:24.368
Last year we were in mounting it

00:48:24.434 --> 00:48:26.270
last or anything --

00:48:26.336 --> 00:48:28.138
And then my next question is for

00:48:28.205 --> 00:48:30.240
those who want --

00:48:30.307 --> 00:48:30.907
To be part of these programs for

00:48:30.974 --> 00:48:32.276
the students.

00:48:32.342 --> 00:48:36.246
Whatever age that student may be --

00:48:36.313 --> 00:48:38.515
What kind of --

00:48:38.582 --> 00:48:40.684
Assistance have we what kind of

00:48:40.751 --> 00:48:41.351
funds and we provided to assist

00:48:41.418 --> 00:48:42.452
them in being able to actually

00:48:42.519 --> 00:48:44.154
take the program to go so often

00:48:44.221 --> 00:48:46.156
transportation is an issue or

00:48:46.223 --> 00:48:46.757
having to take off work isn't

00:48:46.823 --> 00:48:48.659
issues so have we provided on

00:48:48.725 --> 00:48:50.694
any sort of state level three

00:48:50.761 --> 00:48:52.329
workforce development board's.

00:48:52.396 --> 00:48:52.929
Up something to alleviate some

00:48:52.996 --> 00:48:54.498
of the strains.

00:48:54.564 --> 00:48:56.667
So for that particular program

00:48:56.733 --> 00:48:58.502
it's a little different because

00:48:58.568 --> 00:49:00.537
that particular program there

00:49:00.604 --> 00:49:01.171
was a limited number of slots

00:49:01.238 --> 00:49:02.806
and we feel that and many of

00:49:02.873 --> 00:49:04.308
those people are already working.

00:49:04.374 --> 00:49:06.543
In lower jobs so right so there

00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:08.712
is is basically incumbent

00:49:08.779 --> 00:49:10.447
workers that were able --

00:49:10.514 --> 00:49:12.616
To to they already had

00:49:12.683 --> 00:49:12.983
transportation.

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:14.518
But in our regular programs the

00:49:14.584 --> 00:49:16.753
regular corps might be that we

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:18.355
get from the state federal

00:49:18.422 --> 00:49:18.989
government through the state is

00:49:19.056 --> 00:49:20.757
we have support services

00:49:20.824 --> 00:49:22.726
available to put people in those

00:49:22.793 --> 00:49:26.663
programs using our base

00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:28.231
allocation.

00:49:28.298 --> 00:49:30.500
Allocation so there's no

00:49:30.567 --> 00:49:31.168
separate allocation and just to

00:49:31.234 --> 00:49:32.369
give an order of magnitude in

00:49:32.436 --> 00:49:33.003
terms of at least the workforce

00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:34.871
accelerator find and it has been

00:49:34.938 --> 00:49:36.606
in place. For several years now.

00:49:36.673 --> 00:49:37.174
The state is invested about

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:38.408
forty million --

00:49:38.475 --> 00:49:40.610
Grant initiative --

00:49:40.677 --> 00:49:42.579
But they've awarded a hundred

00:49:42.646 --> 00:49:43.080
and twenty five grand.

00:49:43.146 --> 00:49:45.248
And certain about fourteen

00:49:45.315 --> 00:49:48.919
thousand participants statewide --

00:49:48.985 --> 00:49:50.821
I think that you know.

00:49:50.887 --> 00:49:52.789
The point being that I think

00:49:52.856 --> 00:49:53.423
there's an opportunity to double

00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:54.558
serve for individuals and

00:49:54.624 --> 00:49:54.891
obviously --

00:49:54.958 --> 00:49:56.927
The order magnitude is greater

00:49:56.993 --> 00:49:58.495
than the resources that are

00:49:58.562 --> 00:50:00.497
currently being invested --

00:50:00.564 --> 00:50:01.164
But I think what this points to

00:50:01.231 --> 00:50:02.733
is where I think in many ways

00:50:02.799 --> 00:50:06.903
the state board is --

00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:07.137
Hello.

00:50:07.204 --> 00:50:09.139
I'm dina be innovative in terms

00:50:09.206 --> 00:50:12.442
of how it it's making its

00:50:12.509 --> 00:50:15.846
investment than trying to offer

00:50:15.912 --> 00:50:16.546
the best practices in hopes that.

00:50:16.613 --> 00:50:17.781
Not only do.

00:50:17.848 --> 00:50:18.448
Lessons but also ways in which

00:50:18.515 --> 00:50:21.351
we might work.

00:50:21.418 --> 00:50:22.919
His efforts scale.

00:50:22.986 --> 00:50:26.590
And then my last post for it and

00:50:26.656 --> 00:50:29.259
and you guys feel free.

00:50:29.326 --> 00:50:29.926
To wondering do you data on any

00:50:29.993 --> 00:50:33.230
of our because some of these

00:50:33.296 --> 00:50:33.830
programs have it listed do you

00:50:33.897 --> 00:50:38.201
have any date on on their six

00:50:38.268 --> 00:50:38.402
Sir.

00:50:38.468 --> 00:50:40.837
Are the their this.

00:50:40.904 --> 00:50:41.505
Suddenly conducting an elevation

00:50:41.571 --> 00:50:45.509
of these initiatives I believe

00:50:45.575 --> 00:50:46.977
that's under way but now that.

00:50:47.043 --> 00:50:50.580
It's been analyze just yet but

00:50:50.647 --> 00:50:54.584
I'm only in the near future --

00:50:54.651 --> 00:50:56.620
You mentioned [inaudible]

00:50:56.686 --> 00:50:58.555
That you.

00:50:58.622 --> 00:50:59.189
The example that you gave with

00:50:59.256 --> 00:51:00.857
the health.

00:51:00.924 --> 00:51:02.726
Hospital assistant and how you

00:51:02.793 --> 00:51:07.297
got together. To develop correct.

00:51:07.364 --> 00:51:09.266
Graham -- Is

00:51:09.332 --> 00:51:12.169
that are those programs at to be

00:51:12.235 --> 00:51:14.304
specific to the a run to the

00:51:14.371 --> 00:51:14.504
read.

00:51:14.571 --> 00:51:16.740
Or are then they able to be

00:51:16.807 --> 00:51:18.775
taken to another part of the

00:51:18.842 --> 00:51:20.243
state as an example a like a

00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:22.546
already kids that's ready. To go.

00:51:22.612 --> 00:51:24.214
Aye aye.

00:51:24.281 --> 00:51:24.881
I think it it is a package is

00:51:24.948 --> 00:51:26.583
ready to go but what we were

00:51:26.650 --> 00:51:28.518
looking at primarily was the

00:51:28.585 --> 00:51:28.819
only sin --

00:51:28.885 --> 00:51:30.720
An Orange County only basins as

00:51:30.787 --> 00:51:32.589
far the demand for those

00:51:32.656 --> 00:51:33.223
particular jobs what they are

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:34.424
across the state I don't

00:51:34.491 --> 00:51:34.691
remember.

00:51:34.758 --> 00:51:35.358
But certainly the package in the

00:51:35.425 --> 00:51:36.493
information is available to

00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:38.228
distribute and to replicate.

00:51:38.295 --> 00:51:40.263
So if there were a demand in

00:51:40.330 --> 00:51:42.933
another part of the state arms.

00:51:42.999 --> 00:51:43.533
To certain they don't have to

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:50.407
start over rate no no no no they

00:51:50.474 --> 00:51:50.907
should start over okay.

00:51:50.974 --> 00:51:52.576
And actually --

00:51:52.642 --> 00:51:54.311
And I'm sure Dân knows that

00:51:54.377 --> 00:51:54.945
this particular initiative as

00:51:55.011 --> 00:51:56.446
actually put out --

00:51:56.513 --> 00:51:57.113
Eighty in evaluation of its own

00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:58.748
work and has a full report in

00:51:58.815 --> 00:52:04.421
terms of what they learned from.

00:52:04.488 --> 00:52:06.389
The degree to get access to that.

00:52:06.456 --> 00:52:08.391
Because as we look a think what

00:52:08.458 --> 00:52:10.126
you know some of the goal I know

00:52:10.193 --> 00:52:10.760
like it's some of my goal is to

00:52:10.827 --> 00:52:12.863
really figure out how.

00:52:12.929 --> 00:52:14.531
To make that process easier how

00:52:14.598 --> 00:52:16.666
to find out where the gaps are

00:52:16.733 --> 00:52:17.234
regionally these tend to be

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:18.768
regional issues they can be

00:52:18.835 --> 00:52:20.637
duplicated in other regions but

00:52:20.704 --> 00:52:22.339
I know ag has had some great

00:52:22.405 --> 00:52:24.374
success with their workforce

00:52:24.441 --> 00:52:25.008
development board's and some of

00:52:25.075 --> 00:52:26.343
their local issues and you had

00:52:26.409 --> 00:52:26.543
some.

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:28.478
Great success but to not have to

00:52:28.545 --> 00:52:30.213
restart that process every time.

00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:32.549
I thinks incredibly important

00:52:32.616 --> 00:52:34.484
and how we still a tape that

00:52:34.551 --> 00:52:36.086
connection --

00:52:36.152 --> 00:52:36.720
Not just to employers but the

00:52:36.786 --> 00:52:38.788
connection on what works what

00:52:38.855 --> 00:52:39.422
doesn't and how we streamline

00:52:39.489 --> 00:52:40.790
that process so that we can be

00:52:40.857 --> 00:52:42.626
more efficient and then be able

00:52:42.692 --> 00:52:44.594
to push more money to it is kind

00:52:44.661 --> 00:52:47.497
of the goal of of this committee.

00:52:47.564 --> 00:52:48.798
As one of just waiting and I

00:52:48.865 --> 00:52:49.032
think --

00:52:49.099 --> 00:52:52.402
With --

00:52:52.469 --> 00:52:54.538
Being here he a stake in the

00:52:54.604 --> 00:52:57.073
chair of the entire association

00:52:57.140 --> 00:52:59.409
say the California association

00:52:59.476 --> 00:53:00.510
of so I think Jeff to be a great

00:53:00.577 --> 00:53:02.712
kh do it because of the work

00:53:02.779 --> 00:53:04.614
that you do in.

00:53:04.681 --> 00:53:06.716
Your ship you provide.

00:53:06.783 --> 00:53:08.618
Yeah certainly you can pull

00:53:08.685 --> 00:53:09.286
everyone together so that we can

00:53:09.352 --> 00:53:10.420
making sure that resources and

00:53:10.487 --> 00:53:12.923
collaboration is is is out there

00:53:12.989 --> 00:53:13.523
so that we can make sure to

00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:15.158
actually see what's.

00:53:15.225 --> 00:53:16.693
Available because sometimes we

00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:18.662
don't we get our silos and we

00:53:18.728 --> 00:53:19.296
don't know what the right hand

00:53:19.362 --> 00:53:22.399
or left hand is doing.

00:53:22.465 --> 00:53:22.766
And I think --

00:53:22.832 --> 00:53:24.834
Certainly when you're leadership

00:53:24.901 --> 00:53:28.772
capacity you can pull people one

00:53:28.838 --> 00:53:30.874
false the cracks.

00:53:30.941 --> 00:53:32.275
Thank you I'll do my best --

00:53:32.342 --> 00:53:34.210
To Jess yesterday.

00:53:34.277 --> 00:53:34.711
We're just together and

00:53:34.778 --> 00:53:36.646
Bakersfield having conversation

00:53:36.713 --> 00:53:38.548
about all the jobs of that

00:53:38.615 --> 00:53:40.250
Bakersfield has available and

00:53:40.317 --> 00:53:42.786
transporting people from the Los

00:53:42.852 --> 00:53:47.357
Angeles basin area. To relocate

00:53:47.424 --> 00:53:47.857
and a lot of ways --

00:53:47.924 --> 00:53:51.194
To Bakersfield and take on some

00:53:51.261 --> 00:53:51.828
of those job responses of Jan I

00:53:51.895 --> 00:53:52.662
was gather --

00:53:52.729 --> 00:53:54.898
Yesterday cities leadership and

00:53:54.965 --> 00:54:00.470
all input by and by the way

00:54:00.537 --> 00:54:02.238
we're ready to go.

00:54:02.305 --> 00:54:04.240
Deals always ready to go.

00:54:04.307 --> 00:54:08.345
Leaders of thank you on that

00:54:08.411 --> 00:54:08.545
note.

00:54:08.612 --> 00:54:10.380
Dan vocal.

00:54:10.447 --> 00:54:12.415
Okay thank you very much

00:54:12.482 --> 00:54:12.816
assembly woman --

00:54:12.882 --> 00:54:14.684
It's so difficult even know

00:54:14.751 --> 00:54:15.251
where to start you you you

00:54:15.318 --> 00:54:16.920
broach the question before about

00:54:16.987 --> 00:54:18.288
how to the connections how the

00:54:18.355 --> 00:54:18.888
connections made between --

00:54:18.955 --> 00:54:20.690
The the the community colleges

00:54:20.757 --> 00:54:21.358
and education and the businesses

00:54:21.424 --> 00:54:22.258
and vice versa.

00:54:22.325 --> 00:54:26.429
Right before your very knows

00:54:26.496 --> 00:54:27.063
there are forty five workforce

00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:28.665
boards in California.

00:54:28.732 --> 00:54:30.767
Those workforce boards of the

00:54:30.834 --> 00:54:32.602
ones that they are the glue. To

00:54:32.669 --> 00:54:34.738
be able to connect those

00:54:34.804 --> 00:54:36.873
businesses to those educational

00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:38.441
institutions and to the

00:54:38.508 --> 00:54:40.176
educational institutions to the

00:54:40.243 --> 00:54:42.445
employers where they're some of

00:54:42.512 --> 00:54:44.214
the community colleges are

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:44.914
working very closely with us El

00:54:44.981 --> 00:54:46.750
Camino is here today I see El

00:54:46.816 --> 00:54:48.385
Camino is --

00:54:48.451 --> 00:54:50.587
We were it we're have a contract

00:54:50.654 --> 00:54:52.389
ending with El Camino one of the

00:54:52.455 --> 00:54:54.324
strong work force funds at the

00:54:54.391 --> 00:54:56.493
chancellor's office provides.

00:54:56.559 --> 00:54:56.693
Well.

00:54:56.760 --> 00:55:00.296
That's what community because

00:55:00.363 --> 00:55:02.532
reinvent the wheel is work with

00:55:02.599 --> 00:55:04.300
the existing organizations that

00:55:04.367 --> 00:55:04.634
can do that.

00:55:04.701 --> 00:55:08.405
And is such as what El Camino is

00:55:08.471 --> 00:55:10.106
doing and and other great

00:55:10.173 --> 00:55:12.142
community colleges are doing.

00:55:12.208 --> 00:55:12.809
The strong work force money is

00:55:12.876 --> 00:55:16.279
is very much needed and that the

00:55:16.346 --> 00:55:18.281
federal dollars that have come

00:55:18.348 --> 00:55:18.915
down for work for us over the

00:55:18.982 --> 00:55:22.018
past decade has been cut roughly

00:55:22.085 --> 00:55:22.218
50%.

00:55:22.285 --> 00:55:24.621
So any additional funds like

00:55:24.688 --> 00:55:26.423
that strong work force or like

00:55:26.489 --> 00:55:26.790
what leases --

00:55:26.856 --> 00:55:30.293
Cells are mentioned about AB one

00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:30.860
one one one because a year

00:55:30.927 --> 00:55:32.362
leadership --

00:55:32.429 --> 00:55:34.464
Assembly woman and Mike Gipson

00:55:34.531 --> 00:55:36.433
leadership that was able to pass

00:55:36.499 --> 00:55:38.735
a will be getting additional

00:55:38.802 --> 00:55:40.503
resources which will help

00:55:40.570 --> 00:55:42.539
mitigate the losses at the

00:55:42.605 --> 00:55:44.274
federal level.

00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:44.874
So that's that's one thing.

00:55:44.941 --> 00:55:46.376
Another thing is not only

00:55:46.443 --> 00:55:48.445
community colleges it's

00:55:48.511 --> 00:55:50.246
educational system --

00:55:50.313 --> 00:55:52.449
In my work in my work for Syria

00:55:52.515 --> 00:55:54.184
we have.

00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:54.684
Lots and lots of school

00:55:54.751 --> 00:55:56.186
districts.

00:55:56.252 --> 00:55:58.288
And we have a youth council and

00:55:58.354 --> 00:56:00.190
it meets every quarter and I

00:56:00.256 --> 00:56:00.857
look around the room and at any

00:56:00.924 --> 00:56:02.392
given --

00:56:02.459 --> 00:56:04.327
Youth council meeting I might

00:56:04.394 --> 00:56:06.296
have nine or ten superintendents

00:56:06.362 --> 00:56:08.198
at that you've council meeting

00:56:08.264 --> 00:56:08.765
and we have some community

00:56:08.832 --> 00:56:11.101
colleges here we have got state

00:56:11.167 --> 00:56:13.002
the Mingus there.

00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:14.304
And they share ideas and and

00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:16.506
share resources as to what some

00:56:16.573 --> 00:56:18.274
colleges are doing and what

00:56:18.341 --> 00:56:20.477
other school districts need to

00:56:20.543 --> 00:56:20.744
be done.

00:56:20.810 --> 00:56:22.612
We're in Lawndale now so said no

00:56:22.679 --> 00:56:24.681
Union High School district is

00:56:24.748 --> 00:56:26.616
one of my district they have

00:56:26.683 --> 00:56:30.687
nine academies. For those kids

00:56:30.754 --> 00:56:32.555
in high school plus way --

00:56:32.622 --> 00:56:35.058
Occupational training programs

00:56:35.125 --> 00:56:37.393
well we work very closely with

00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:38.728
them we've provided many

00:56:38.795 --> 00:56:41.131
employers and businesses to help

00:56:41.197 --> 00:56:42.632
the cabin Mayes and that's

00:56:42.699 --> 00:56:44.367
something that the work for the

00:56:44.434 --> 00:56:45.001
board should be doing in are

00:56:45.068 --> 00:56:46.269
doing.

00:56:46.336 --> 00:56:48.571
Throughout the state but we need

00:56:48.638 --> 00:56:50.607
the coordination.

00:56:50.673 --> 00:56:54.544
SpaceX I was listening --

00:56:54.611 --> 00:56:55.145
To the young lady to my right

00:56:55.211 --> 00:56:56.946
over from SpaceX.

00:56:57.013 --> 00:56:59.115
There is a program called non

00:56:59.182 --> 00:57:00.984
destructive testing.

00:57:01.050 --> 00:57:01.551
Through American technical

00:57:01.618 --> 00:57:04.687
academy.

00:57:04.754 --> 00:57:05.255
Well they're on our list of

00:57:05.321 --> 00:57:06.856
providers.

00:57:06.923 --> 00:57:08.625
And we've literally.

00:57:08.691 --> 00:57:11.361
Trained dozens of people for

00:57:11.427 --> 00:57:14.898
SpaceX for that occupation why

00:57:14.964 --> 00:57:16.399
did we train them because

00:57:16.466 --> 00:57:19.002
they're needed SpaceX told us

00:57:19.068 --> 00:57:19.402
they're needed.

00:57:19.469 --> 00:57:19.669
So -- We

00:57:19.736 --> 00:57:21.171
work with the local businesses

00:57:21.237 --> 00:57:22.605
that way we've connected SpaceX

00:57:22.672 --> 00:57:26.509
with lots of the high schools in

00:57:26.576 --> 00:57:28.411
the area so that they can work.

00:57:28.478 --> 00:57:30.647
The engineering academies and

00:57:30.713 --> 00:57:34.284
that only seven alibied else el

00:57:34.350 --> 00:57:34.884
Segundo in Redondo Beach and

00:57:34.951 --> 00:57:38.488
many other districts --

00:57:38.555 --> 00:57:42.158
What is the what what the?

00:57:42.225 --> 00:57:44.360
Is very important because now

00:57:44.427 --> 00:57:44.994
what they're doing is setting up

00:57:45.061 --> 00:57:46.329
certifications.

00:57:46.396 --> 00:57:48.565
Not just degree programs but

00:57:48.631 --> 00:57:50.500
certifications and what many of

00:57:50.567 --> 00:57:52.468
the individuals need to I think

00:57:52.535 --> 00:57:54.337
you're talking about today.

00:57:54.404 --> 00:57:58.308
Our certifications to get a job.

00:57:58.374 --> 00:57:58.942
I sure would like them all to

00:57:59.008 --> 00:58:00.376
get college degrees but that's

00:58:00.443 --> 00:58:02.312
not going to happen.

00:58:02.378 --> 00:58:02.912
In their individuals that if

00:58:02.979 --> 00:58:04.681
they're moving in the right

00:58:04.747 --> 00:58:06.349
direction and getting a

00:58:06.416 --> 00:58:08.184
certification in the area that

00:58:08.251 --> 00:58:10.220
the employers in businesses need.

00:58:10.286 --> 00:58:12.088
Then they're going to get a job

00:58:12.155 --> 00:58:12.589
so we're setting up the

00:58:12.655 --> 00:58:14.390
certifications working with the

00:58:14.457 --> 00:58:16.492
colleges community colleges and

00:58:16.559 --> 00:58:18.494
other schools so that after that

00:58:18.561 --> 00:58:20.129
certification is finished.

00:58:20.196 --> 00:58:22.498
They can get a job that's a we

00:58:22.565 --> 00:58:24.434
wanna do not now because I

00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:25.034
wanted to mention a couple of

00:58:25.101 --> 00:58:26.135
the things.

00:58:26.202 --> 00:58:28.538
Apprenticeship programs well.

00:58:28.605 --> 00:58:30.640
Because of where we are there's

00:58:30.707 --> 00:58:32.342
so much --

00:58:32.408 --> 00:58:32.942
Construction going on a we're

00:58:33.009 --> 00:58:36.346
getting it thousand people hired

00:58:36.412 --> 00:58:38.181
at the very at the stadium in

00:58:38.248 --> 00:58:40.216
the Hollywood park --

00:58:40.283 --> 00:58:40.483
Program.

00:58:40.550 --> 00:58:42.285
Many of them going into the

00:58:42.352 --> 00:58:44.120
apprentice programs the majority

00:58:44.187 --> 00:58:46.489
of them orientations every two

00:58:46.556 --> 00:58:46.723
weeks.

00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:48.591
But what we were thinking is

00:58:48.658 --> 00:58:51.060
okay the a job in their premise

00:58:51.127 --> 00:58:54.230
apprentice programs but we need

00:58:54.297 --> 00:58:54.797
more apprentice programs.

00:58:54.864 --> 00:58:56.532
So what we formed --

00:58:56.599 --> 00:59:00.136
Couple years ago was a pre

00:59:00.203 --> 00:59:00.536
apprenticeship --

00:59:00.603 --> 00:59:04.274
Aerospace program engineering

00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:04.874
program called Errol slacks.

00:59:04.941 --> 00:59:06.276
And we had a hundred pre

00:59:06.342 --> 00:59:06.876
apprentices go through that

00:59:06.943 --> 00:59:08.311
program.

00:59:08.378 --> 00:59:10.413
Now we have a fully blown

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:12.248
certified --

00:59:12.315 --> 00:59:14.817
Flex are engineering apprentice

00:59:14.884 --> 00:59:16.719
program for many of the defense

00:59:16.786 --> 00:59:18.288
industry companies Boeing

00:59:18.354 --> 00:59:20.390
Northrop impressa is a whole

00:59:20.456 --> 00:59:22.125
list of them that we have.

00:59:22.191 --> 00:59:24.661
We'd love to have space six join

00:59:24.727 --> 00:59:26.729
us on and and what we want to do

00:59:26.796 --> 00:59:30.233
is create a pool of individuals.

00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:32.669
That they can go right into the

00:59:32.735 --> 00:59:34.404
engineering program we had our

00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:36.639
first apprentice --

00:59:36.706 --> 00:59:38.441
In role just last month through

00:59:38.508 --> 00:59:40.443
a company called Empresa locally

00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:42.145
here in Gardena.

00:59:42.211 --> 00:59:44.614
And we have the template.

00:59:44.681 --> 00:59:46.716
For it has to be designed by

00:59:46.783 --> 00:59:48.918
businesses that's the way it

00:59:48.985 --> 00:59:50.520
works they control the

00:59:50.586 --> 00:59:52.655
curriculum we have a consultant

00:59:52.722 --> 00:59:54.691
work with them to help design it.

00:59:54.757 --> 00:59:56.426
And then we pass it along to our

00:59:56.492 --> 00:59:58.361
great community colleges to help

00:59:58.428 --> 01:00:00.496
facilitate it down the line.

01:00:00.563 --> 01:00:01.130
That works so well that we said

01:00:01.197 --> 01:00:04.600
let's there let's use that

01:00:04.667 --> 01:00:06.469
template and design other

01:00:06.536 --> 01:00:08.438
apprenticeship programs.

01:00:08.504 --> 01:00:10.239
Now we're working on a bio flex

01:00:10.306 --> 01:00:12.408
program. For production

01:00:12.475 --> 01:00:14.544
technician lab technicians in

01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:14.877
partnership.

01:00:14.944 --> 01:00:16.679
With supervisor mark Ridley

01:00:16.746 --> 01:00:18.481
Thomas is very interested in

01:00:18.548 --> 01:00:20.550
that we're working on that right

01:00:20.616 --> 01:00:22.518
now a bio flex program down the

01:00:22.585 --> 01:00:24.487
line we have applications.

01:00:24.554 --> 01:00:26.990
Working with the state board

01:00:27.056 --> 01:00:28.558
hopefully we get funded for a

01:00:28.624 --> 01:00:32.362
cloud flex computer aerospace

01:00:32.428 --> 01:00:32.595
prop --

01:00:32.662 --> 01:00:34.931
Apprenticeship program as well

01:00:34.998 --> 01:00:36.566
as a dental flex apprenticeship

01:00:36.632 --> 01:00:38.601
program.

01:00:38.668 --> 01:00:40.403
And transportation flex program

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:42.572
so we want to take this model we

01:00:42.638 --> 01:00:44.540
want to do it in our area.

01:00:44.607 --> 01:00:46.776
We want to do it in your area

01:00:46.843 --> 01:00:48.878
head and Mike Gipson area roll

01:00:48.945 --> 01:00:52.682
that out in the LA basin so the

01:00:52.749 --> 01:00:54.350
LA basin hasn't.

01:00:54.417 --> 01:00:55.051
Then roll that out to the state.

01:00:55.118 --> 01:00:56.652
In our era flex program we're

01:00:56.719 --> 01:00:58.221
getting calls from Florida from

01:00:58.287 --> 01:01:00.256
other states that want to

01:01:00.323 --> 01:01:02.225
replicate what we've done.

01:01:02.291 --> 01:01:04.327
So I think we have the design

01:01:04.394 --> 01:01:06.496
and again it has to be employer

01:01:06.562 --> 01:01:08.765
driven that's the only way it

01:01:08.831 --> 01:01:10.533
works so we're going to have

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.368
multiple apprenticeship programs

01:01:12.435 --> 01:01:14.037
going down the line --

01:01:14.103 --> 01:01:16.439
Another important thing is.

01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:18.374
You know nowadays is a lot of

01:01:18.441 --> 01:01:18.908
people working I mean we

01:01:18.975 --> 01:01:20.643
certainly have those individuals

01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:22.578
that are unemployed and we're

01:01:22.645 --> 01:01:23.179
getting a marina employee.

01:01:23.246 --> 01:01:24.714
Using the prison system running

01:01:24.781 --> 01:01:26.349
special programs but many people

01:01:26.416 --> 01:01:28.518
are working but what they need

01:01:28.584 --> 01:01:30.486
is a lake up so that they can

01:01:30.553 --> 01:01:32.755
keep going. One of the programs

01:01:32.822 --> 01:01:34.624
that we have all to the problems

01:01:34.690 --> 01:01:36.559
the state of California has one

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:38.561
is the employment training panel --

01:01:38.628 --> 01:01:40.563
Camino.

01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:42.298
Can help businesses when

01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:44.200
employment training panel South

01:01:44.267 --> 01:01:44.834
Bay workforce investment board

01:01:44.901 --> 01:01:45.268
can help with --

01:01:45.334 --> 01:01:46.369
Employment training panel to

01:01:46.436 --> 01:01:48.805
help those businesses upgrade

01:01:48.871 --> 01:01:49.038
skills.

01:01:49.105 --> 01:01:51.107
But we also have on a regular

01:01:51.174 --> 01:01:54.644
basis allocation 20%.

01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:58.381
Of our fine in the adult pro the

01:01:58.448 --> 01:02:00.383
program may be utilized for

01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:02.418
incumbent workers.

01:02:02.485 --> 01:02:03.086
So we can take individuals that

01:02:03.152 --> 01:02:04.620
are working and have them

01:02:04.687 --> 01:02:06.889
trained and many of this is

01:02:06.956 --> 01:02:08.424
certificate programs that are

01:02:08.491 --> 01:02:10.827
available and community colleges.

01:02:10.893 --> 01:02:12.495
Maybe additional combined with

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:14.363
on the job training.

01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:14.997
And be able to upgrade their

01:02:15.064 --> 01:02:16.933
skills today and get them the

01:02:16.999 --> 01:02:18.668
better wages and it's available

01:02:18.734 --> 01:02:20.470
right now.

01:02:20.536 --> 01:02:22.605
Is available and we're doing it.

01:02:22.672 --> 01:02:24.607
All the time --

01:02:24.674 --> 01:02:26.776
Ominous as assemblyman Gibson

01:02:26.843 --> 01:02:28.478
said we were at the meet the

01:02:28.544 --> 01:02:30.847
whole bunch of oil companies

01:02:30.913 --> 01:02:31.147
yesterday.

01:02:31.214 --> 01:02:33.015
In the past five years or so

01:02:33.082 --> 01:02:35.284
we've placed over thirty three

01:02:35.351 --> 01:02:36.853
thousand individuals and the

01:02:36.919 --> 01:02:38.955
refineries.

01:02:39.021 --> 01:02:39.355
Probably around.

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:40.756
Thirty five hundred so we have

01:02:40.823 --> 01:02:42.825
ideas and what we want to be

01:02:42.892 --> 01:02:43.426
doing with that witcher well

01:02:43.493 --> 01:02:46.729
good paying jobs and and can

01:02:46.796 --> 01:02:47.196
support themselves.

01:02:47.263 --> 01:02:50.399
So there's very good things

01:02:50.466 --> 01:02:51.033
going on the state of California

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:52.735
we want to keep it going want to

01:02:52.802 --> 01:02:54.537
concentrate on the training.

01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:58.241
And forget the paperwork and

01:02:58.307 --> 01:03:00.343
let's go on and train people.

01:03:00.409 --> 01:03:00.643
Thank you.

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:02.345
So I do have a question what.

01:03:02.411 --> 01:03:03.012
In your experience what is the

01:03:03.079 --> 01:03:04.647
final thing that drives

01:03:04.714 --> 01:03:06.382
employers to actually come to

01:03:06.449 --> 01:03:10.319
your door what is that final

01:03:10.386 --> 01:03:10.920
step that makes them that.

01:03:10.987 --> 01:03:12.488
They get tired of not having the

01:03:12.555 --> 01:03:13.156
employees that they finally come

01:03:13.222 --> 01:03:14.690
to and then to the employers

01:03:14.757 --> 01:03:16.592
that are here with us today.

01:03:16.659 --> 01:03:18.594
What could we do to get to maybe

01:03:18.661 --> 01:03:20.263
to the workforce investment

01:03:20.329 --> 01:03:20.930
boards a little sooner to create

01:03:20.997 --> 01:03:23.032
that curriculum I realize it's a

01:03:23.099 --> 01:03:24.400
lot of work?

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:26.769
I realize it's adjustment in the

01:03:26.836 --> 01:03:28.738
model of what you've done in the

01:03:28.804 --> 01:03:32.308
past what would incentivize and

01:03:32.375 --> 01:03:32.975
is a little thing that they say

01:03:33.042 --> 01:03:33.176
well.

01:03:33.242 --> 01:03:34.777
I I think it's geared to showing

01:03:34.844 --> 01:03:36.612
successes we have to show

01:03:36.679 --> 01:03:38.581
successes and they need to hear

01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:40.383
from the other businesses on

01:03:40.449 --> 01:03:40.883
what's been able to be

01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:42.285
accomplished.

01:03:42.351 --> 01:03:42.952
And we have a list of businesses

01:03:43.019 --> 01:03:44.754
that are willing to speak for us

01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:46.856
and be able to talk to other

01:03:46.923 --> 01:03:50.326
businesses about it because what

01:03:50.393 --> 01:03:50.927
we want to do it we want.

01:03:50.993 --> 01:03:52.762
To the workforce boards need to

01:03:52.828 --> 01:03:54.363
do all the work they need to do

01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:56.499
the paperwork they need to free

01:03:56.566 --> 01:03:58.434
the employers up of of of the

01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:00.670
bureaucratic stuff we'll we'll

01:04:00.736 --> 01:04:02.405
take care of all that.

01:04:02.471 --> 01:04:04.507
What they need to do is see the

01:04:04.574 --> 01:04:06.275
results and when they see the

01:04:06.342 --> 01:04:06.909
many people getting jobs when

01:04:06.976 --> 01:04:08.611
they see the thousands of people

01:04:08.678 --> 01:04:10.179
we've been able to get connect?

01:04:10.246 --> 01:04:12.215
To construction and oil

01:04:12.281 --> 01:04:12.815
companies and by the way with

01:04:12.882 --> 01:04:14.350
all the construction.

01:04:14.417 --> 01:04:16.752
That yields other jobs if you

01:04:16.819 --> 01:04:17.353
construct something you need

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:20.223
support support people working

01:04:20.289 --> 01:04:20.856
there and that's what we need.

01:04:20.923 --> 01:04:22.792
So with that with the work force

01:04:22.858 --> 01:04:24.493
binding with these academies

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:26.429
being --

01:04:26.495 --> 01:04:28.331
Being built at various --

01:04:28.397 --> 01:04:30.166
Public schools.

01:04:30.233 --> 01:04:32.535
And working closely with their

01:04:32.602 --> 01:04:34.637
work for sports in there one

01:04:34.704 --> 01:04:38.341
stop centers --

01:04:38.407 --> 01:04:40.509
Great things are happening here --

01:04:40.576 --> 01:04:42.578
Organizations we partner with

01:04:42.645 --> 01:04:44.347
those organizations the boards

01:04:44.413 --> 01:04:46.349
have all those organizations on

01:04:46.415 --> 01:04:50.052
our board we have the schools we

01:04:50.119 --> 01:04:50.586
have a plan to develop a

01:04:50.653 --> 01:04:52.321
different we have community

01:04:52.388 --> 01:04:54.624
based organizations we have.

01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:55.224
Almost any organization that

01:04:55.291 --> 01:04:56.659
that that work force is

01:04:56.726 --> 01:04:58.461
important too so they don't need

01:04:58.527 --> 01:05:00.663
to go to other organizations I

01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:02.465
need to go to the board.

01:05:02.531 --> 01:05:04.367
And work with those boards and

01:05:04.433 --> 01:05:04.967
tell them what they need and

01:05:05.034 --> 01:05:06.369
those boards will deliver the

01:05:06.435 --> 01:05:12.308
services for them.

01:05:12.375 --> 01:05:14.543
I'm speaking of boards you have --

01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:16.279
Is there chambers of commerce

01:05:16.345 --> 01:05:16.612
relationship.

01:05:16.679 --> 01:05:20.416
With the greater Los and Sam

01:05:20.483 --> 01:05:22.218
ecommerce a the chambers of of

01:05:22.285 --> 01:05:24.553
of clippers it you know a tell

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:25.187
you what we did a couple years

01:05:25.254 --> 01:05:26.489
ago we had all the chambers of

01:05:26.555 --> 01:05:28.524
commerce and are eleven cities

01:05:28.591 --> 01:05:30.359
come to a meeting.

01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:30.926
We invited all the economic

01:05:30.993 --> 01:05:35.231
development administrators from

01:05:35.298 --> 01:05:35.865
the eleven cities all sit down

01:05:35.931 --> 01:05:36.932
together.

01:05:36.999 --> 01:05:39.168
And some of the elected

01:05:39.235 --> 01:05:40.803
officials a little Valentine was

01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:41.304
at that meeting I seek

01:05:41.370 --> 01:05:43.205
counseling about Tonya.

01:05:43.272 --> 01:05:43.873
And we said the chambers and to

01:05:43.939 --> 01:05:47.109
the economic development

01:05:47.176 --> 01:05:47.610
directors of the city.

01:05:47.677 --> 01:05:48.844
What can we do for you just like

01:05:48.911 --> 01:05:50.813
we did with the health care you

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:52.782
tell us what you need?

01:05:52.848 --> 01:05:53.449
And what they needed was mapping

01:05:53.516 --> 01:05:54.817
they needed asset. For the

01:05:54.884 --> 01:05:57.253
region to show where the spaces

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:58.554
are so instead of a business

01:05:58.621 --> 01:06:00.823
moving out and moving to Texas

01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:02.892
we could say wait a minute don't

01:06:02.958 --> 01:06:03.159
do that.

01:06:03.225 --> 01:06:04.960
You want to move out of the city

01:06:05.027 --> 01:06:06.629
for some reason we have other

01:06:06.696 --> 01:06:08.698
areas right your backyard.

01:06:08.764 --> 01:06:12.468
So we created that for them --

01:06:12.535 --> 01:06:16.072
Intern bàn study we did --

01:06:16.138 --> 01:06:18.808
Throughout the South Bay because

01:06:18.874 --> 01:06:20.409
was requested of us with South

01:06:20.476 --> 01:06:22.912
Bay caught so we meet with the

01:06:22.978 --> 01:06:24.580
chambers all the time bring them

01:06:24.647 --> 01:06:24.847
together.

01:06:24.914 --> 01:06:26.682
And we're here to support the

01:06:26.749 --> 01:06:28.984
chambers one of the follow up

01:06:29.051 --> 01:06:29.618
question you made mention about

01:06:29.685 --> 01:06:31.220
the transportation program.

01:06:31.287 --> 01:06:34.557
Can you Jess --

01:06:34.623 --> 01:06:35.157
Tell me a little bit about the

01:06:35.224 --> 01:06:36.459
transition from.

01:06:36.525 --> 01:06:40.363
Well the purchase program there.

01:06:40.429 --> 01:06:41.030
The what what the LA and by the

01:06:41.097 --> 01:06:43.032
Federal Highway Administration

01:06:43.099 --> 01:06:44.333
for example federal agency that --

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:46.369
Overseas a lot of the

01:06:46.435 --> 01:06:48.371
construction going on came to us.

01:06:48.437 --> 01:06:50.373
Because they said.

01:06:50.439 --> 01:06:52.441
How are you doing this job by?

01:06:52.508 --> 01:06:54.677
Being able to recruit all these

01:06:54.744 --> 01:06:56.612
individuals and to construction

01:06:56.679 --> 01:06:57.179
and transportation because

01:06:57.246 --> 01:06:58.514
frankly federal highway

01:06:58.581 --> 01:07:00.549
administration.

01:07:00.616 --> 01:07:02.251
Looks to serve the underserved

01:07:02.318 --> 01:07:04.253
individuals particularly African

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:06.589
American males women and they

01:07:06.655 --> 01:07:08.391
haven't been able to do it.

01:07:08.457 --> 01:07:10.459
We've we've have 80% of the

01:07:10.526 --> 01:07:12.728
people that we recruited have

01:07:12.795 --> 01:07:14.430
been underserved population we

01:07:14.497 --> 01:07:16.665
just had a whole class of women

01:07:16.732 --> 01:07:17.099
graduate and go into

01:07:17.166 --> 01:07:18.734
apprenticeship program for the

01:07:18.801 --> 01:07:20.102
construction.

01:07:20.169 --> 01:07:22.338
So they designated --

01:07:22.405 --> 01:07:24.173
Hollywood park project and LA

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:26.509
acts one of the LA X. projects

01:07:26.575 --> 01:07:28.511
as pilot programs for FHA and

01:07:28.577 --> 01:07:30.646
nay funded us a little bit of

01:07:30.713 --> 01:07:32.548
money. To be able to keep doing

01:07:32.615 --> 01:07:34.884
what we do those projects and to

01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:36.285
provide the support services

01:07:36.352 --> 01:07:38.621
necessary you know people have

01:07:38.687 --> 01:07:39.288
to get from one place to another

01:07:39.355 --> 01:07:40.489
well they have to do that we

01:07:40.556 --> 01:07:42.491
have to figure out how best to

01:07:42.558 --> 01:07:42.725
do it.

01:07:42.792 --> 01:07:43.058
They need --

01:07:43.125 --> 01:07:45.094
Money up front sometimes to join

01:07:45.161 --> 01:07:48.497
the unions you know and that we

01:07:48.564 --> 01:07:48.964
help them with that.

01:07:49.031 --> 01:07:50.599
So on the FHA came to us and we

01:07:50.666 --> 01:07:53.269
delivered they said we want we

01:07:53.335 --> 01:07:54.937
want to deliver fifty people we

01:07:55.004 --> 01:07:56.739
know you can't do it very fast.

01:07:56.806 --> 01:07:58.340
Because it takes us a long time

01:07:58.407 --> 01:08:01.010
will give you eighteen months we

01:08:01.076 --> 01:08:01.444
didn't two months.

01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:02.678
So -- And we

01:08:02.745 --> 01:08:05.247
work with metro like I said LA

01:08:05.314 --> 01:08:08.551
acts so --

01:08:08.617 --> 01:08:10.553
And it all help because of that

01:08:10.619 --> 01:08:11.220
construction projects that we're

01:08:11.287 --> 01:08:13.422
doing we have orientation. Two

01:08:13.489 --> 01:08:16.859
weeks so they know that were

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:17.526
there now in person will start

01:08:17.593 --> 01:08:19.128
doing it once a month into it

01:08:19.195 --> 01:08:20.596
it's every two weeks.

01:08:20.663 --> 01:08:22.898
So it's a matter of getting the

01:08:22.965 --> 01:08:23.432
word out getting the city

01:08:23.499 --> 01:08:24.800
councils to announce it --

01:08:24.867 --> 01:08:28.904
Getting billboards up if we care.

01:08:28.971 --> 01:08:32.441
And and word of mouth they're

01:08:32.508 --> 01:08:36.212
one of the my final comment one

01:08:36.278 --> 01:08:36.645
of things that --

01:08:36.712 --> 01:08:38.581
That I found out more more is

01:08:38.647 --> 01:08:39.181
the lack of individuals with

01:08:39.248 --> 01:08:42.785
their class a driver license to

01:08:42.852 --> 01:08:44.453
become truck drivers now.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:44.987
The drive up and down the

01:08:45.054 --> 01:08:48.357
seventeen freeways wanted fifty

01:08:48.424 --> 01:08:48.991
two thousand dollars a year all

01:08:49.058 --> 01:08:50.593
you need is a class a driver

01:08:50.659 --> 01:08:52.561
license.

01:08:52.628 --> 01:08:53.028
I know there's a great

01:08:53.095 --> 01:08:53.696
partnership that the California

01:08:53.762 --> 01:08:54.630
trucking so station dot money

01:08:54.697 --> 01:08:56.565
into the Long Beach City College

01:08:56.632 --> 01:08:58.534
speaking them can connect in the

01:08:58.601 --> 01:09:00.436
community college --

01:09:00.503 --> 01:09:02.438
Where you can go get your class

01:09:02.505 --> 01:09:04.406
A. Dr licensing --

01:09:04.473 --> 01:09:06.542
Right into a job make it fifty

01:09:06.609 --> 01:09:07.109
two thousand dollars a truck

01:09:07.176 --> 01:09:10.045
drivers there's a lot of jobs

01:09:10.112 --> 01:09:10.546
that's right billable.

01:09:10.613 --> 01:09:12.414
But we have no qualify skill

01:09:12.481 --> 01:09:14.583
individuals we have a class a

01:09:14.650 --> 01:09:16.485
driver license so is that

01:09:16.552 --> 01:09:18.254
something you can also look at

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:20.356
to try to connect and make a

01:09:20.422 --> 01:09:22.458
real and relevant.

01:09:22.525 --> 01:09:24.260
So there there's a list at the

01:09:24.326 --> 01:09:26.328
state level it's called --

01:09:26.395 --> 01:09:32.234
ETP L. it's a list of schools.

01:09:32.301 --> 01:09:35.037
More schools are put on that

01:09:35.104 --> 01:09:37.306
list from the South Bay

01:09:37.373 --> 01:09:37.940
workforce investment than any

01:09:38.007 --> 01:09:38.607
other area in the state we have

01:09:38.674 --> 01:09:40.476
thousands of courses available

01:09:40.543 --> 01:09:40.910
hundred to schools.

01:09:40.976 --> 01:09:42.444
And some of those a truck driver

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:43.012
school some of them a great

01:09:43.078 --> 01:09:44.947
truck driver schools if they

01:09:45.014 --> 01:09:46.582
don't place the people we take

01:09:46.649 --> 01:09:48.584
them off the list they have to

01:09:48.651 --> 01:09:50.753
get jobs. For this two ways of

01:09:50.819 --> 01:09:51.453
doing it somebody can go up the

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:52.588
street going to the training and

01:09:52.655 --> 01:09:54.823
do that or hire some people at a

01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:56.592
lower level.

01:09:56.659 --> 01:09:58.027
Than we can use our incumbent

01:09:58.093 --> 01:10:02.431
worker funds. To to provide

01:10:02.498 --> 01:10:03.032
additional training for that

01:10:03.098 --> 01:10:04.733
individual so they can go into

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:06.569
the truck driving once they're

01:10:06.635 --> 01:10:10.072
already employed.

01:10:10.139 --> 01:10:10.639
So there's two ways of doing

01:10:10.706 --> 01:10:10.940
[inaudible]

01:10:11.006 --> 01:10:14.076
Thank you.

01:10:14.143 --> 01:10:16.078
Question.

01:10:16.145 --> 01:10:16.278
Okay.

01:10:16.345 --> 01:10:18.147
But more of a comment I mean

01:10:18.213 --> 01:10:18.747
earlier we mentioned that.

01:10:18.814 --> 01:10:20.316
Or someone had mentioned that we

01:10:20.382 --> 01:10:20.916
need like a conduit right to

01:10:20.983 --> 01:10:22.117
connect --

01:10:22.184 --> 01:10:24.153
Business --

01:10:24.219 --> 01:10:39.034
To community colleges it's for

01:10:39.101 --> 01:10:42.571
sports right. Forty five work

01:10:42.638 --> 01:10:46.175
was there that do it yeah there

01:10:46.241 --> 01:10:48.477
already are there are salute

01:10:48.544 --> 01:10:48.744
there is.

01:10:48.811 --> 01:10:50.212
A work.

01:10:50.279 --> 01:10:52.314
It's always a work sports so

01:10:52.381 --> 01:10:52.948
every every area at every he

01:10:53.015 --> 01:10:54.650
said geography and the state has

01:10:54.717 --> 01:10:56.218
a work force support.

01:10:56.285 --> 01:10:56.852
And they have one stop centers

01:10:56.919 --> 01:10:58.487
or whatever the official name is

01:10:58.554 --> 01:10:58.821
now American.

01:10:58.887 --> 01:11:02.658
I always I think that the per

01:11:02.725 --> 01:11:04.426
the successes that you've had

01:11:04.493 --> 01:11:06.629
all of all the programs that you

01:11:06.695 --> 01:11:06.862
listed.

01:11:06.929 --> 01:11:08.497
You know how do you replicate

01:11:08.564 --> 01:11:10.165
that in other areas.

01:11:10.232 --> 01:11:12.468
Any place in itself could just

01:11:12.534 --> 01:11:14.269
call us and we'll come up there

01:11:14.336 --> 01:11:15.004

your premise you get to see.

01:17:49.197 --> 01:17:50.732
The work that we do that we've

01:17:50.799 --> 01:17:52.167

01:17:52.234 --> 01:17:52.834

Thank you for being here and I

01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:00.475
am a huge supporter of the

01:18:00.542 --> 01:18:02.010
building trades --

01:18:02.077 --> 01:18:04.212
For my district you have been a

01:18:04.279 --> 01:18:06.048
direct access to a lot of very.

01:18:06.114 --> 01:18:08.116
Amazing great paying jobs that

01:18:08.183 --> 01:18:10.185
that not just --

01:18:10.252 --> 01:18:10.786
Take care of the person who's

01:18:10.852 --> 01:18:11.319
getting a job with their

01:18:11.386 --> 01:18:14.322
families as well so I've always

01:18:14.389 --> 01:18:14.923
been a very proud supporter.

01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:16.391
Of the building trades but who

01:18:16.458 --> 01:18:18.226
do you have any idea how many

01:18:18.293 --> 01:18:20.228
apprentices you have right now

01:18:20.295 --> 01:18:22.064
and where they're coming from.

01:18:22.130 --> 01:18:24.499
Italian Orange County with the

01:18:24.566 --> 01:18:26.368
survey im gonna guess what five

01:18:26.435 --> 01:18:28.170
years ago maybe six years ago.

01:18:28.236 --> 01:18:28.804
And I think we had about four

01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:30.405
thousand apprentices we did a

01:18:30.472 --> 01:18:32.140
survey again about a year and a

01:18:32.207 --> 01:18:34.309
half two years ago we had over

01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:34.810
ten thousand a process.

01:18:34.876 --> 01:18:36.111
I'm going to guess it's a couple

01:18:36.178 --> 01:18:38.447
of thousand more than that so we

01:18:38.513 --> 01:18:38.647
have.

01:18:38.713 --> 01:18:40.449
It's called significantly and

01:18:40.515 --> 01:18:42.484
others no went to it because of

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:43.151
the work that's out there in the

01:18:43.218 --> 01:18:44.453
future.

01:18:44.519 --> 01:18:45.020
And you know where they're

01:18:45.087 --> 01:18:46.688
coming from how you're finding

01:18:46.755 --> 01:18:47.289
them because I remember there

01:18:47.355 --> 01:18:48.423
was a time you all struggled a

01:18:48.490 --> 01:18:50.225
little bit with getting

01:18:50.292 --> 01:18:52.427
apprentices and what the changes

01:18:52.494 --> 01:18:52.861
been and how you've.

01:18:52.928 --> 01:18:54.629
Been able to find them obvious I

01:18:54.696 --> 01:18:56.231
mean it was reference of the

01:18:56.298 --> 01:18:56.832
workforce development partner

01:18:56.898 --> 01:18:58.100
with the workforce development

01:18:58.166 --> 01:18:58.333
board.

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:00.235
Are agreements I think when we

01:19:00.302 --> 01:19:00.802
partner with like a school

01:19:00.869 --> 01:19:02.437
district a community college

01:19:02.504 --> 01:19:04.139
municipality.

01:19:04.206 --> 01:19:08.577
All the different stakeholders

01:19:08.643 --> 01:19:10.512
in the community classes and so

01:19:10.579 --> 01:19:12.647
it's a combination of the

01:19:12.714 --> 01:19:13.248
community now rolling up our

01:19:13.315 --> 01:19:16.251
sleeves and reaching out as as

01:19:16.318 --> 01:19:20.255
much as we can to recruit folks.

01:19:20.322 --> 01:19:22.324
I don't have a comment.

01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:22.924
When I was on the city council

01:19:22.991 --> 01:19:24.559
almost two years in Carson --

01:19:24.626 --> 01:19:26.495
Through project labor agreements

01:19:26.561 --> 01:19:30.132
for one and then also --

01:19:30.198 --> 01:19:32.300
I think out to tour all the

01:19:32.367 --> 01:19:34.269
princes programs was IBEW --

01:19:34.336 --> 01:19:36.204
Pipefitters whatever --

01:19:36.271 --> 01:19:38.840
They give especially those who

01:19:38.907 --> 01:19:40.375
are recent incarcerated

01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:42.577
opportunity I know the laborers --

01:19:42.644 --> 01:19:44.312
They actually go into prison.

01:19:44.379 --> 01:19:46.515
And take those brothers and

01:19:46.581 --> 01:19:48.416
sisters out of prisons getting

01:19:48.483 --> 01:19:49.017
released and move them right

01:19:49.084 --> 01:19:50.252
into an apprentice program.

01:19:50.318 --> 01:19:52.521
Which is again a look giving

01:19:52.587 --> 01:19:54.789
those individuals the ability to

01:19:54.856 --> 01:19:56.224
write a new chapter I'm for

01:19:56.291 --> 01:19:58.493
their lives and also giving them

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:00.095
a decent living --

01:20:00.162 --> 01:20:02.430
We just we talked about some

01:20:02.497 --> 01:20:04.299
lifers who Jess got out and

01:20:04.366 --> 01:20:16.244
they're in a program and those

01:20:16.311 --> 01:20:18.446
individuals don't wanna go back

01:20:18.513 --> 01:20:20.415
to prison and so this is.

01:20:20.482 --> 01:20:22.217
Again.

01:20:22.284 --> 01:20:24.619
Over a new leaf a right in

01:20:24.686 --> 01:20:26.154
recent car.

01:20:26.221 --> 01:20:26.721
Place into a German program

01:20:26.788 --> 01:20:28.390
print program to get them and

01:20:28.456 --> 01:20:30.425
that out Jan.

01:20:30.492 --> 01:20:34.563
If they don't have their you

01:20:34.629 --> 01:20:36.231
know their equipment having the

01:20:36.298 --> 01:20:38.600
same conversation making sure

01:20:38.667 --> 01:20:42.103
there's a strong coordination so

01:20:42.170 --> 01:20:44.139
that no one falls through the

01:20:44.206 --> 01:20:44.773
cracks because I think there's a

01:20:44.839 --> 01:20:46.575

01:20:46.641 --> 01:20:48.043

01:22:16.831 --> 01:22:18.800
little game with me.

01:22:18.867 --> 01:22:19.434
We're on the verge of the for

01:22:19.501 --> 01:22:20.602
the Dodge revolution release has

01:22:20.669 --> 01:22:21.236
been spoken as such and we can

01:22:21.303 --> 01:22:22.771
take these little phones

01:22:22.837 --> 01:22:23.371
nowadays and click them in the

01:22:23.438 --> 01:22:28.410
head as in like what four years

01:22:28.476 --> 01:22:28.977
which is an Olympic cycle.

01:22:29.044 --> 01:22:30.545
Our technical assistance will be

01:22:30.612 --> 01:22:32.180
here on the planet beaming in

01:22:32.247 --> 01:22:34.149
through a virtual reality.

01:22:34.215 --> 01:22:34.716
This building will be smart

01:22:34.783 --> 01:22:36.318
interfaced.

01:22:36.384 --> 01:22:38.586
So it's not just about how do I

01:22:38.653 --> 01:22:39.254
get you a job today about how do

01:22:39.321 --> 01:22:40.689
we actually creates for teaching

01:22:40.755 --> 01:22:42.223
amounts for the state of

01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:42.724
California because it's

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:44.626
workforce and economic

01:22:44.693 --> 01:22:46.161
development.

01:22:46.227 --> 01:22:48.330
So that's my favorite thing to

01:22:48.396 --> 01:22:48.863
talk about is how are we

01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:50.131
actually creating opportunity

01:22:50.198 --> 01:22:52.133
they're expanding our economy

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:54.436
growing it verses just.

01:22:54.502 --> 01:22:55.070
Taking time to the minimum spew

01:22:55.136 --> 01:22:56.504
of it and saying are there

01:22:56.571 --> 01:22:58.173
enough jobs.

01:22:58.239 --> 01:22:58.840
Their jobs we are doing a great

01:22:58.907 --> 01:23:00.241
job of matching them.

01:23:00.308 --> 01:23:04.212
And the reason I think is we

01:23:04.279 --> 01:23:04.813
think too much in terms of

01:23:04.879 --> 01:23:06.481
occupation and not in terms of

01:23:06.548 --> 01:23:08.183
skill.

01:23:08.249 --> 01:23:12.187
In the article are the P. P. I

01:23:12.253 --> 01:23:12.887
see report that was reported at

01:23:12.954 --> 01:23:16.191
the top of this event.

01:23:16.257 --> 01:23:18.293
There is a coherent says.

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:18.927
A workforce that cannot me or

01:23:18.993 --> 01:23:20.295
retain sufficient training for

01:23:20.362 --> 01:23:22.530
an in demand job is thus unable

01:23:22.597 --> 01:23:24.432
to take advantage of economic

01:23:24.499 --> 01:23:25.066
opportunities I think that's or

01:23:25.133 --> 01:23:26.234
hearing.

01:23:26.301 --> 01:23:28.536
And the next sentence that says

01:23:28.603 --> 01:23:30.171
moreover.

01:23:30.238 --> 01:23:32.107
The skills of the state's

01:23:32.173 --> 01:23:32.807
workforce will have an impact on

01:23:32.874 --> 01:23:34.542
California's national and

01:23:34.609 --> 01:23:36.144
international competitiveness.

01:23:36.211 --> 01:23:36.745
The failure to meet workforce

01:23:36.811 --> 01:23:38.446
needs could limit or alter the

01:23:38.513 --> 01:23:40.048
state's economic growth.

01:23:40.115 --> 01:23:42.150
Didn't say occupation.

01:23:42.217 --> 01:23:44.152
They said skills.

01:23:44.219 --> 01:23:46.321
What needs to back improve is

01:23:46.388 --> 01:23:48.490
are signaling between the

01:23:48.556 --> 01:23:50.392
ecosystem of workforce

01:23:50.458 --> 01:23:51.025
development community colleges

01:23:51.092 --> 01:23:52.160
K.?

01:23:52.227 --> 01:23:54.529
Twelve all of this and the the

01:23:54.596 --> 01:23:56.498
kind of framework we talk about

01:23:56.564 --> 01:23:58.733
it now so guided pathways how do

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:00.402
students understand what the

01:24:00.468 --> 01:24:02.670
skills are in demand.

01:24:02.737 --> 01:24:04.372
How is the economy and employer

01:24:04.439 --> 01:24:06.174
signaling it?

01:24:06.241 --> 01:24:06.775
And so we see some interesting

01:24:06.841 --> 01:24:07.008
things.

01:24:07.075 --> 01:24:10.478
Now we're having a great day and

01:24:10.545 --> 01:24:11.079
workforce economical with me

01:24:11.146 --> 01:24:12.514
colleges we went from two

01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:13.114
hundred thousand invested in

01:24:13.181 --> 01:24:14.249
workforce and economic five

01:24:14.315 --> 01:24:16.518
years ago. To one point two

01:24:16.584 --> 01:24:20.288
billion now and are for jobs in

01:24:20.355 --> 01:24:22.390
the economy.

01:24:22.457 --> 01:24:24.292
Framework to help us roll out

01:24:24.359 --> 01:24:24.959
this in this this is where the

01:24:25.026 --> 01:24:26.461
eight ecosystem conversation

01:24:26.528 --> 01:24:28.463
comes into play where we've done

01:24:28.530 --> 01:24:29.030
a lot of work in systems

01:24:29.097 --> 01:24:30.398
development between.

01:24:30.465 --> 01:24:32.400
The commuter colleges and

01:24:32.467 --> 01:24:34.302
regions across the state as well

01:24:34.369 --> 01:24:34.936
as industry sectors across the

01:24:35.003 --> 01:24:36.471
state and that's where you're

01:24:36.538 --> 01:24:36.738
hearing.

01:24:36.805 --> 01:24:38.306
Some of these activities huge

01:24:38.373 --> 01:24:40.275
investments and apprenticeships

01:24:40.341 --> 01:24:44.112
especially new and innovative

01:24:44.179 --> 01:24:44.779
apprenticeships and so there's a

01:24:44.846 --> 01:24:46.414
lot of experimentation going on

01:24:46.481 --> 01:24:48.516
and are job with the can you

01:24:48.583 --> 01:24:50.819
college at the system level is

01:24:50.885 --> 01:24:51.052
to see.

01:24:51.119 --> 01:24:52.420
What's working and helping that

01:24:52.487 --> 01:24:54.589
scaling grow and replicate words

01:24:54.656 --> 01:24:56.524
words effective.

01:24:56.591 --> 01:24:56.724
Now.

01:24:56.791 --> 01:24:58.259
What we need to do is think of

01:24:58.326 --> 01:25:00.428
education not as lego blocks

01:25:00.495 --> 01:25:00.962
that we put together and

01:25:01.029 --> 01:25:02.363
stackable credentials like put

01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:03.031
these like was together we have

01:25:03.097 --> 01:25:04.532
to think of it as a freeway

01:25:04.599 --> 01:25:04.766
system?

01:25:04.833 --> 01:25:06.501
Where when you want talk about

01:25:06.568 --> 01:25:08.303
career technical education it's

01:25:08.369 --> 01:25:08.937
that acceleration lane you get

01:25:09.003 --> 01:25:10.638
on so you can go out speed on

01:25:10.705 --> 01:25:12.674
the freeway to the destination --

01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:14.275
Going.

01:25:14.342 --> 01:25:14.943
And that we should continue to

01:25:15.009 --> 01:25:16.711
be life long learners because

01:25:16.778 --> 01:25:18.213
the demands.

01:25:18.279 --> 01:25:18.813
From the economic development

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:20.949
that will see in the near future

01:25:21.015 --> 01:25:24.352
is that the jobs of tomorrow

01:25:24.419 --> 01:25:24.819
five years from now.

01:25:24.886 --> 01:25:27.088
Don't exist today and so those

01:25:27.155 --> 01:25:28.456
skilled dimensions of

01:25:28.523 --> 01:25:30.658
occupations haven't been form so

01:25:30.725 --> 01:25:32.594
how can education system which

01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:34.996
takes two years to develop

01:25:35.063 --> 01:25:35.296
curriculum.

01:25:35.363 --> 01:25:38.366
Become responsive.

01:25:38.433 --> 01:25:42.971
Those there are identify

01:25:43.037 --> 01:25:43.538
people's reading as a more

01:25:43.605 --> 01:25:44.572
discreet ways that we have a

01:25:44.639 --> 01:25:46.774
student say taking a two year

01:25:46.841 --> 01:25:48.877
study program.

01:25:48.943 --> 01:25:49.410
Has to job out or quit.

01:25:49.477 --> 01:25:50.979
They don't lose everything

01:25:51.045 --> 01:25:53.281
there's some indication learning.

01:25:53.348 --> 01:25:56.651
So using those little badges

01:25:56.718 --> 01:25:58.820
they're actually using little --

01:25:58.887 --> 01:26:02.290
Meta data points for learning

01:26:02.357 --> 01:26:02.891
because we're not looking for

01:26:02.957 --> 01:26:04.292
knowledge all the knowledge of

01:26:04.359 --> 01:26:04.826
the universe is right here

01:26:04.893 --> 01:26:06.761
Google answer that question for

01:26:06.828 --> 01:26:08.530
you right now.

01:26:08.596 --> 01:26:09.130
What we're looking for skills

01:26:09.197 --> 01:26:10.765
which are performative?

01:26:10.832 --> 01:26:12.634
And we need indicators that show

01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:14.869
that I know how to perform. To I

01:26:14.936 --> 01:26:16.738
know how to the piano looking at

01:26:16.804 --> 01:26:17.405
me you couldn't tell but I could

01:26:17.472 --> 01:26:18.640
show you if I could.

01:26:18.706 --> 01:26:20.708
Well what if I could also

01:26:20.775 --> 01:26:22.544
someone who knows what good

01:26:22.610 --> 01:26:24.612
piano playing is certify my

01:26:24.679 --> 01:26:26.214
ability to do so and give me

01:26:26.281 --> 01:26:26.548
that a badge.

01:26:26.614 --> 01:26:28.216
That represents that.

01:26:28.283 --> 01:26:30.285
And so we see a lot of changing

01:26:30.351 --> 01:26:32.353
going on in terms of what

01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:32.921
reading this looks like for

01:26:32.987 --> 01:26:34.389
students.

01:26:34.455 --> 01:26:34.923
And most of its around

01:26:34.989 --> 01:26:36.791
reputation management like

01:26:36.858 --> 01:26:38.426
linkedin profiles or purfling

01:26:38.493 --> 01:26:40.728
profiles where they can show.

01:26:40.795 --> 01:26:44.299
Actual skills and I think the

01:26:44.365 --> 01:26:44.966
key is that it has we work and

01:26:45.033 --> 01:26:46.901
learned we can't afford to put

01:26:46.968 --> 01:26:48.736
students for two years.

01:26:48.803 --> 01:26:55.109
In a tacit knowledge experience --

01:26:55.176 --> 01:26:55.810
The actual skills that they will

01:26:55.877 --> 01:26:58.646
be compensated for so we see

01:26:58.713 --> 01:27:00.882
more and more --

01:27:00.949 --> 01:27:02.817
Work based arrangements --

01:27:02.884 --> 01:27:05.153
Concurrent enrollment is also

01:27:05.219 --> 01:27:05.553
another huge --

01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:08.222
Track we seen education trying

01:27:08.289 --> 01:27:08.790
to push people through the

01:27:08.856 --> 01:27:10.692
curricula process quickly but

01:27:10.758 --> 01:27:12.460
also to give them the actual

01:27:12.527 --> 01:27:14.762
performance of skill sets they

01:27:14.829 --> 01:27:15.163
need to the job.

01:27:15.229 --> 01:27:16.698
So much easier to get a job if

01:27:16.764 --> 01:27:17.298
you're already working in the

01:27:17.365 --> 01:27:18.866
workplace and people know you

01:27:18.933 --> 01:27:20.468
and you understand the process.

01:27:20.535 --> 01:27:22.804
Than it is to go through for

01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:23.471
your bachelor's degree and then

01:27:23.538 --> 01:27:24.739
just gone to the market hope you

01:27:24.806 --> 01:27:26.374
got hired.

01:27:26.441 --> 01:27:27.008
So those are some of the trends

01:27:27.075 --> 01:27:30.612
research and commute call as we

01:27:30.678 --> 01:27:31.179
continue to do all all these

01:27:31.245 --> 01:27:33.181
ecosystem developments I think

01:27:33.247 --> 01:27:34.582
there's opportunity to further

01:27:34.649 --> 01:27:37.118
develop the economic side of the

01:27:37.185 --> 01:27:39.320
house in terms of the ecosystems

01:27:39.387 --> 01:27:41.456
there between the ET seize the

01:27:41.522 --> 01:27:41.789
CDCs on that.

01:27:41.856 --> 01:27:44.392
ABC's and really take a very

01:27:44.459 --> 01:27:46.628
very strategic approach to

01:27:46.694 --> 01:27:48.463
whites and like.

01:27:48.529 --> 01:27:49.097
We all who's better positioned

01:27:49.163 --> 01:27:52.600
in this in the nation to leave

01:27:52.667 --> 01:27:56.404
before the dust especially with

01:27:56.471 --> 01:27:58.106
our new online conference space

01:27:58.172 --> 01:27:58.606
college and positioning

01:27:58.673 --> 01:28:00.708
ourselves to drive that economy

01:28:00.775 --> 01:28:02.143
through town development.

01:28:02.210 --> 01:28:04.212
And business opportunity

01:28:04.278 --> 01:28:06.214
entrepreneurship mindsets and so

01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:08.282
I think that is really the story

01:28:08.349 --> 01:28:08.816
to be telling about how.

01:28:08.883 --> 01:28:10.284
Can you colleges should be

01:28:10.351 --> 01:28:12.587
moving forward into tomorrow but

01:28:12.654 --> 01:28:14.222
in today were having a great

01:28:14.288 --> 01:28:14.822
opportunity to have a lot of

01:28:14.889 --> 01:28:16.758
funds available overseeing great

01:28:16.824 --> 01:28:18.159
outcomes.

01:28:18.226 --> 01:28:18.826
And you for a lot of those with

01:28:18.893 --> 01:28:20.662
our partners today and I'm just

01:28:20.728 --> 01:28:22.363
hoping to inspire a vision for

01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:24.399
what we could really do with it

01:28:24.465 --> 01:28:25.066
large capacity of the community

twelve our workforce important

01:29:54.989 --> 01:29:56.557
each industry so our industry

01:29:56.624 --> 01:29:58.392
partners as an economic

01:29:58.459 --> 01:30:00.328
development corporation --

01:30:00.394 --> 01:30:00.995

And so in our region.

01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:06.801
If we're going to be demand

01:30:06.868 --> 01:30:08.736
driven in terms of our work

01:30:08.803 --> 01:30:10.605
force an education system that

01:30:10.671 --> 01:30:11.172
we need to start with the

01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:12.807
research in applied work so what

01:30:12.874 --> 01:30:14.742
are what is the future for the

01:30:14.809 --> 01:30:16.244
labor and the demand.

01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:18.412
Side the supply.

01:30:18.479 --> 01:30:19.080
So what we're doing as Ellie EDC

01:30:19.147 --> 01:30:20.681
is working with our community

01:30:20.748 --> 01:30:23.117
colleges to take a look at our

01:30:23.184 --> 01:30:25.086
the over producing under

01:30:25.153 --> 01:30:26.954
producing what are it to the new

01:30:27.021 --> 01:30:28.689
clothes a course open of course.

01:30:28.756 --> 01:30:30.858
What is the future of work were

01:30:30.925 --> 01:30:32.493
also to having that same car

01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:33.094
received in with a workforce

01:30:33.161 --> 01:30:34.929
development board's in providing

01:30:34.996 --> 01:30:36.964
a study that allows them to take

01:30:37.031 --> 01:30:38.533
that labor market information?

01:30:38.599 --> 01:30:40.535
And think the future of working

01:30:40.601 --> 01:30:42.236
be demand driven and we are now

01:30:42.303 --> 01:30:44.572
engaging with our CSU system are

01:30:44.639 --> 01:30:45.206
California State University to

01:30:45.273 --> 01:30:46.541
have that same conversation so

01:30:46.607 --> 01:30:48.609
that they have the right labor

01:30:48.676 --> 01:30:50.611
market information. To think

01:30:50.678 --> 01:30:51.212
about the future of work and

01:30:51.279 --> 01:30:54.048
talk about things like

01:30:54.115 --> 01:30:56.083
automation tax.

01:30:56.150 --> 01:30:58.219
That research that informs our

01:30:58.286 --> 01:30:58.920
strategic industry engagement so

01:30:58.986 --> 01:31:00.588
the center for competitive work

01:31:00.655 --> 01:31:02.423
force is the largest LA regional

01:31:02.490 --> 01:31:04.592
strong work force project.

01:31:04.659 --> 01:31:06.394
Amongst the nineteen colleges

01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:08.496
and it's a strategic partnership

01:31:08.563 --> 01:31:10.631
between the nineteen community

01:31:10.698 --> 01:31:12.500
colleges of the alley --

01:31:12.567 --> 01:31:14.468
C. R. C. Ellie EDC the center of

01:31:14.535 --> 01:31:15.069

the commute colleges.

01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:18.439
And Ellie chamber.

01:31:18.506 --> 01:31:20.341
And its strategic in the sense

01:31:20.408 --> 01:31:22.043
that we came together.

01:31:22.109 --> 01:31:26.013
To partner across the industry's

01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:38.793
stream Keats men and not

01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:42.129
duplicate and to understand what

01:31:42.196 --> 01:31:44.198
are the competencies we need.

01:31:44.265 --> 01:31:46.067
For on what it is not.

01:31:46.133 --> 01:31:50.171
In it for market.

01:31:50.238 --> 01:31:50.371
Yes.

01:31:50.438 --> 01:31:52.406
Information with Everitt.

01:31:52.473 --> 01:31:54.242
I'm up.

01:31:54.308 --> 01:31:56.143
Comes industry councils so

01:31:56.210 --> 01:31:58.145
beyond jazz --

01:31:58.212 --> 01:31:58.813
A part of the industry gauge men

01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:00.581
is we only want to talk about

01:32:00.648 --> 01:32:01.182
your work force needs for an

01:32:01.249 --> 01:32:02.516
employer that could also be a

01:32:02.583 --> 01:32:04.585
put off very.

01:32:04.652 --> 01:32:05.086
A part of the industry

01:32:05.152 --> 01:32:05.553
engagement is to look

01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:08.756
holistically about what do you

01:32:08.823 --> 01:32:09.357
have tax incentive means land

01:32:09.423 --> 01:32:10.658
use issues workforce issues and

01:32:10.725 --> 01:32:11.125
to talk about it as

01:32:11.192 --> 01:32:12.627
comprehensive to me employer.

01:32:12.693 --> 01:32:13.294
And to speak their language and

01:32:13.361 --> 01:32:14.795
then to bring that back to the

01:32:14.862 --> 01:32:16.297
system -- In

01:32:16.364 --> 01:32:16.898
addition it also informs our

01:32:16.964 --> 01:32:18.199
workforce development council so

01:32:18.266 --> 01:32:18.866
we invite the entire work force

01:32:18.933 --> 01:32:20.468
and education community in LA

01:32:20.534 --> 01:32:22.236
county to a quarterly meeting.

01:32:22.303 --> 01:32:22.904
To talk about regional industry

01:32:22.970 --> 01:32:24.572
engagement regional industry

01:32:24.639 --> 01:32:26.374
business intelligence

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:27.008
initiatives that cross across

01:32:27.074 --> 01:32:28.476
the system.

01:32:28.542 --> 01:32:30.411
And then to also hear back from

01:32:30.478 --> 01:32:32.280
everybody about what additional

01:32:32.346 --> 01:32:34.282
information what competencies

01:32:34.348 --> 01:32:34.815
who are you engaging as an

01:32:34.882 --> 01:32:36.450
employer can folks come to that

01:32:36.517 --> 01:32:36.717
meeting.

01:32:36.784 --> 01:32:38.486
And so we have pro actively side

01:32:38.552 --> 01:32:40.354
we will partner to host these

01:32:40.421 --> 01:32:42.723
meanings so that we can house

01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:44.659
one conversation about advanced

01:32:44.725 --> 01:32:46.427
manufacturing technical means.

01:32:46.494 --> 01:32:50.498
I'm and all of the strategic

01:32:50.564 --> 01:32:54.568
industry engage trees so --

01:32:54.635 --> 01:33:00.241
Our bio are aerospace are --

01:33:00.308 --> 01:33:02.176
Transportation and so forth.

01:33:02.243 --> 01:33:02.877
And all of this then informs our

01:33:02.944 --> 01:33:04.378
transactional work size I

01:33:04.445 --> 01:33:06.614
mention for CCW the center for

01:33:06.681 --> 01:33:08.549
competitive work force that goes

01:33:08.616 --> 01:33:10.384
into the course development.

01:33:10.451 --> 01:33:12.520
Employment engagement the work

01:33:12.586 --> 01:33:13.120
based learning the internship

01:33:13.187 --> 01:33:16.090
opportunities are industry

01:33:16.157 --> 01:33:16.724
councils is also the business

01:33:16.791 --> 01:33:18.492
assistance that they may need.

01:33:18.559 --> 01:33:20.661
And formalizing these industry

01:33:20.728 --> 01:33:22.463
feedback loops that are open for

01:33:22.530 --> 01:33:26.300
anyone to attend and we do know

01:33:26.367 --> 01:33:28.269
we share back with the community.

01:33:28.336 --> 01:33:28.803
We also men for workforce

01:33:28.869 --> 01:33:30.471
development council then is to

01:33:30.538 --> 01:33:32.340
bring not online meant to take

01:33:32.406 --> 01:33:33.007
the funding and see where we can

01:33:33.074 --> 01:33:34.275
all partner.

01:33:34.342 --> 01:33:36.344
And so as another part of the

01:33:36.410 --> 01:33:38.279
center for compatible force that

01:33:38.346 --> 01:33:38.946
we identified is C. C. W. smart

01:33:39.013 --> 01:33:40.314
match.

01:33:40.381 --> 01:33:42.283
So we also realize in talking

01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:42.950
with industry they may have high

01:33:43.017 --> 01:33:44.485
school internships are work

01:33:44.552 --> 01:33:46.554
first of imports do a great job

01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:48.723
there's alley summer you've

01:33:48.789 --> 01:33:50.191
higher here in the region.

01:33:50.257 --> 01:33:52.393
College and universities have

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:52.960
internship programs in our

01:33:53.027 --> 01:33:54.428
graduate schools but what

01:33:54.495 --> 01:33:56.197
doesn't exist or the community

01:33:56.263 --> 01:33:58.299
colleges and so.

01:33:58.366 --> 01:33:58.899
We talked to employers about

01:33:58.966 --> 01:34:00.534
there's a half million folks

01:34:00.601 --> 01:34:02.336
being served in our region if we

01:34:02.403 --> 01:34:04.305
include Orange County we talk

01:34:04.372 --> 01:34:04.872
about three quarters of a

01:34:04.939 --> 01:34:06.307
million individuals of a talent.

01:34:06.374 --> 01:34:08.342
That you are not tapping into

01:34:08.409 --> 01:34:10.678
and so talking to them about

01:34:10.745 --> 01:34:11.212
internships levering our

01:34:11.278 --> 01:34:14.181
employer relationships so that

01:34:14.248 --> 01:34:16.350
we're talking about closing the

01:34:16.417 --> 01:34:18.085
skills gap.

01:34:18.152 --> 01:34:18.753
I mourn and most importantly in

01:34:18.819 --> 01:34:20.554
order for us to be demand driven

01:34:20.621 --> 01:34:22.123
industry responsive future

01:34:22.189 --> 01:34:22.723
forward in adoptive we also

01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:24.692
believe we need to connect in

01:34:24.759 --> 01:34:26.527
real time as the former panel

01:34:26.594 --> 01:34:28.429
had discussed.

01:34:28.496 --> 01:34:30.498
So we're creating any if which

01:34:30.564 --> 01:34:34.535
is the regional CRM more LED

01:34:34.602 --> 01:34:36.270
sees committed to push regional

01:34:36.337 --> 01:34:38.139
business intelligence.

01:34:38.205 --> 01:34:40.141
Our community colleges are all

01:34:40.207 --> 01:34:42.343
committed to being on it I mean

01:34:42.410 --> 01:34:42.810
gauging our workforce

01:34:42.877 --> 01:34:44.178
development board's to also use

01:34:44.245 --> 01:34:46.447
their regional funding to invest

01:34:46.514 --> 01:34:46.981
in it as well so that.

01:34:47.048 --> 01:34:48.516
Throughout our entire workforce

01:34:48.582 --> 01:34:50.551
and education system we'll be on

01:34:50.618 --> 01:34:52.686
one portable so an employer like

01:34:52.753 --> 01:34:54.355
Mister Dawson from chevron can

01:34:54.422 --> 01:34:56.223
come in and say Hey I'm looking

01:34:56.290 --> 01:34:58.359
for P. tack who has P. tack.

01:34:58.426 --> 01:34:58.959
And in real time our entire

01:34:59.026 --> 01:35:00.528
workforce education system will

01:35:00.594 --> 01:35:02.496
get that message and be able to

01:35:02.563 --> 01:35:04.732
reply an LED see on the back and

01:35:04.799 --> 01:35:06.500
will be able to monitor that to

01:35:06.567 --> 01:35:08.135
make sure there is a quick

01:35:08.202 --> 01:35:08.402
response.

01:35:08.469 --> 01:35:12.440
And so we do this easy W..

01:35:12.506 --> 01:35:13.040
I need with the teens every

01:35:13.107 --> 01:35:14.475
other week --

01:35:14.542 --> 01:35:16.444
To go over it so when I'm

01:35:16.510 --> 01:35:17.011
talking about taking this

01:35:17.078 --> 01:35:18.579
knowledge and connecting it back

01:35:18.646 --> 01:35:20.614
to the system it's an actual

01:35:20.681 --> 01:35:24.452
formalized loop --

01:35:24.518 --> 01:35:26.387
And so we are hoping.

01:35:26.454 --> 01:35:28.322
LED see would also like to

01:35:28.389 --> 01:35:30.424
recommend when we envision

01:35:30.491 --> 01:35:31.092
workforce provided for keep to

01:35:31.158 --> 01:35:32.193
twelve the community colleges

01:35:32.259 --> 01:35:34.195
the workforce development board

01:35:34.261 --> 01:35:34.829
I'll have this funding telling

01:35:34.895 --> 01:35:36.130
regionally.

01:35:36.197 --> 01:35:38.432
And to engage industry the boat

01:35:38.499 --> 01:35:40.267
we would also be bold enough to

01:35:40.334 --> 01:35:40.901
ask that we consider for a cal

01:35:40.968 --> 01:35:42.703
state university system that the

01:35:42.770 --> 01:35:44.638
same type of investment.

01:35:44.705 --> 01:35:46.507
Is also made because a lot of

01:35:46.574 --> 01:35:48.576
the courses are thought to be

01:35:48.642 --> 01:35:50.411
matriculating upwards and so for

01:35:50.478 --> 01:35:52.279
leaving them out of the equation

01:35:52.346 --> 01:35:54.648
number leaving out that box are

01:35:54.715 --> 01:35:54.915
degreed.

01:35:54.982 --> 01:35:56.650
Opportunity which we now the

01:35:56.717 --> 01:35:58.619
higher level of education behind

01:35:58.686 --> 01:36:02.423
median weights and so we in the

01:36:02.490 --> 01:36:04.258
region have the CSU.

01:36:04.325 --> 01:36:06.560
Five so the five CS use in our

01:36:06.627 --> 01:36:10.598
region have connected you. To

01:36:10.664 --> 01:36:14.368
the relay institute and so my

01:36:14.435 --> 01:36:15.002
job an LED sees to know about

01:36:15.069 --> 01:36:16.504
all that I have the fortune of

01:36:16.570 --> 01:36:18.139
being mentored under dam vocal

01:36:18.205 --> 01:36:20.574
and formally working at south be

01:36:20.641 --> 01:36:20.841
with him.

01:36:20.908 --> 01:36:22.243
And so if you're actually

01:36:22.309 --> 01:36:22.877
wondering if this happens it

01:36:22.943 --> 01:36:24.311
definitely does --

01:36:24.378 --> 01:36:26.614
I don't know if you've heard

01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:28.149
about the Amazon web services

01:36:28.215 --> 01:36:30.518
that the cloud computing

01:36:30.584 --> 01:36:32.520
certificate that was developed

01:36:32.586 --> 01:36:33.087
at a Santa Monica college.

01:36:33.154 --> 01:36:34.355
Is being replicated by on

01:36:34.421 --> 01:36:36.590
nineteen in the region so if you

01:36:36.657 --> 01:36:37.224
live in Compton you don't have

01:36:37.291 --> 01:36:40.227
to drive Santa Monica college

01:36:40.294 --> 01:36:40.861
and also because there elation

01:36:40.928 --> 01:36:42.129
agreements.

01:36:42.196 --> 01:36:44.098
And then based upon the great

01:36:44.165 --> 01:36:44.732
error flax model that's out the

01:36:44.798 --> 01:36:46.634
we've created we reach out to

01:36:46.700 --> 01:36:48.836
them to talk about clout flax

01:36:48.903 --> 01:36:50.371
and how do we bring the work

01:36:50.437 --> 01:36:50.871
force boards into the

01:36:50.938 --> 01:36:52.239
conversation as well.

01:36:52.306 --> 01:36:54.475
And take advantage of that and

01:36:54.542 --> 01:36:55.075
so what you're seeing in LA

01:36:55.142 --> 01:36:58.212
county is that there is this

01:36:58.279 --> 01:36:58.812
cross system alignment this

01:36:58.879 --> 01:37:02.216
regional engagement but it also

01:37:02.283 --> 01:37:02.750
comes at the expense of

01:37:02.816 --> 01:37:04.685
investing in this infrastructure.

01:37:04.752 --> 01:37:06.754
So that it can be continued

01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:08.656
replicated an employer can just

01:37:08.722 --> 01:37:10.724
go to one place to share an

01:37:10.791 --> 01:37:16.163
opportunity and get a response.

01:37:16.230 --> 01:37:16.463
Thank you.

01:37:16.530 --> 01:37:20.267
Thank you at Dr rack.

01:37:20.334 --> 01:37:22.436
Hi -- I'm a

01:37:22.503 --> 01:37:24.471
the dean of business at a Camino

01:37:24.538 --> 01:37:26.140
college and I do work closely

01:37:26.207 --> 01:37:26.774
with Jessica and I worked with

01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:30.211
her at Nguyen and Janet the web.

01:37:30.277 --> 01:37:30.844
And I'm working with their the

01:37:30.911 --> 01:37:32.780
LA the EDC and on the center for

01:37:32.846 --> 01:37:34.315
competitive workforce and

01:37:34.381 --> 01:37:36.517
various other things so --

01:37:36.584 --> 01:37:37.117
I would like to say that I am

01:37:37.184 --> 01:37:40.120
thrilled to see the emphasis on

01:37:40.187 --> 01:37:40.688
career technical education.

01:37:40.754 --> 01:37:42.423
It's something in which I

01:37:42.489 --> 01:37:44.692
strongly believe I am a product

01:37:44.758 --> 01:37:50.998
of the community college I went

01:37:51.065 --> 01:37:53.300
to El Camino college.

01:37:53.367 --> 01:37:45.693
He got.

01:37:45.693 --> 01:37:47.928
And the degree in paralegal

01:37:47.995 --> 01:37:48.362
studies [inaudible]

01:37:48.429 --> 01:37:49.730
I went.

01:37:49.797 --> 01:37:51.899
Law school.

01:37:51.966 --> 01:37:56.070
Paralegal left debt so I would.

01:37:56.136 --> 01:37:58.072
Love to help other students do

01:37:58.138 --> 01:37:59.540
the same thing.

01:37:59.607 --> 01:38:11.418
So I I know the value of getting

01:38:11.485 --> 01:38:11.685
a skill.

01:38:11.752 --> 01:38:13.220
And using that skill to help put

01:38:13.287 --> 01:38:13.621
yourself through.

01:38:13.687 --> 01:38:15.356
Through --

01:38:15.422 --> 01:38:17.124
Getting a career and that then

01:38:17.191 --> 01:38:22.363
that getting even moving up the

01:38:22.429 --> 01:38:23.831
scale as you go along --

01:38:23.897 --> 01:38:24.498
We actually don't Camino have a

01:38:24.565 --> 01:38:26.066
couple of of new --

01:38:26.133 --> 01:38:26.700
Programs that I think will help

01:38:26.767 --> 01:38:28.269
others do that you can stop

01:38:28.335 --> 01:38:29.937
along the way --

01:38:30.004 --> 01:38:34.308
Use that skill for moving up to

01:38:34.375 --> 01:38:34.642
type one ago.

01:38:34.708 --> 01:38:36.610
And one of them is what Jessica

01:38:36.677 --> 01:38:38.045
brought up in that is the a WS a

01:38:38.112 --> 01:38:40.347
cloud certification.

01:38:40.414 --> 01:38:42.082
Program that is a we are one of

01:38:42.149 --> 01:38:44.451
the nineteen that is involved in

01:38:44.518 --> 01:38:44.652
that.

01:38:44.718 --> 01:38:47.855
All of our curriculum has passed

01:38:47.921 --> 01:38:48.489
through curriculum we will be

01:38:48.555 --> 01:38:50.057
offering the first courses in

01:38:50.124 --> 01:38:51.859
fall.

01:38:51.925 --> 01:38:53.861
Of for that program and we're

01:38:53.927 --> 01:38:56.230
really excited about that one of

01:38:56.297 --> 01:38:57.765
the interesting things about a

01:38:57.831 --> 01:38:59.767
W. S. was that it's not a huge

01:38:59.833 --> 01:39:02.036
monetary commitment --

01:39:02.102 --> 01:39:04.004
It's a development curriculum

01:39:04.071 --> 01:39:06.173
and a very dedicated faculty

01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:06.407
member.

01:39:06.473 --> 01:39:08.208
Who is willing to go for the

01:39:08.275 --> 01:39:09.843
certification --

01:39:09.910 --> 01:39:12.079
Who is willing to develop the

01:39:12.146 --> 01:39:14.214
curriculum to guided through and

01:39:14.281 --> 01:39:16.050
to get started?

01:39:16.116 --> 01:39:16.650
And to be involved with the

01:39:16.717 --> 01:39:18.419
other nineteen schools to make

01:39:18.485 --> 01:39:22.022
sure that we are on board.

01:39:22.089 --> 01:39:22.656
And they are all working as a

01:39:22.723 --> 01:39:24.491
team and I think it's it's been

01:39:24.558 --> 01:39:26.360
touted as the first time that's

01:39:26.427 --> 01:39:27.795
ever happened.

01:39:27.861 --> 01:39:28.429
So it's it's always interesting

01:39:28.495 --> 01:39:30.130
to see and and it all started

01:39:30.197 --> 01:39:32.232
with Santa Monica which I think

01:39:32.299 --> 01:39:34.368
if if you happen to know much

01:39:34.435 --> 01:39:35.936
about community colleges that's

01:39:36.003 --> 01:39:38.205
supposed to be a big competitor.

01:39:38.272 --> 01:39:40.174
So -- We're

01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:41.975
we're thrilled to be were was to

01:39:42.042 --> 01:39:45.713
be Amazon --

01:39:45.779 --> 01:39:47.648
They were --

01:39:47.715 --> 01:39:49.883
You know telling us what they

01:39:49.950 --> 01:39:50.217
needed -- To

01:39:50.284 --> 01:39:52.086
be able to certify these people

01:39:52.152 --> 01:39:54.288
to work for them so that is

01:39:54.355 --> 01:39:56.023
going to be we think huge --

01:39:56.090 --> 01:39:57.991
When I talk with --

01:39:58.058 --> 01:40:00.194
Santa Monica they opened their

01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:02.162
first class it was filled within

01:40:02.229 --> 01:40:04.298
an hour of opening it so.

01:40:04.365 --> 01:40:06.100
That the statistics are think

01:40:06.166 --> 01:40:08.202
was it two thousand jobs.

01:40:08.268 --> 01:40:10.237
And is two thousand jobs

01:40:10.304 --> 01:40:10.704
available a month --

01:40:10.771 --> 01:40:12.272
In aid of U. S. so we're we're

01:40:12.339 --> 01:40:14.007
looking --

01:40:14.074 --> 01:40:14.641
Of course now that's going to

01:40:14.708 --> 01:40:16.143
spread around all nineteen

01:40:16.210 --> 01:40:17.845
colleges so --

01:40:17.911 --> 01:40:20.013
But but that is that you know it

01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:20.647
that I think that there's a huge

01:40:20.714 --> 01:40:23.917
opening and the the north far

01:40:23.984 --> 01:40:25.853
north is starting to ask how can

01:40:25.919 --> 01:40:27.921
we replicate what you're doing

01:40:27.988 --> 01:40:28.555
down there so we're we're we're

01:40:28.622 --> 01:40:32.226
excited about it. One of the

01:40:32.292 --> 01:40:32.493
program --

01:40:32.559 --> 01:40:34.061
I'm going to mention it is up

01:40:34.128 --> 01:40:35.896
and running --

01:40:35.963 --> 01:40:38.165
Has been and is has is --

01:40:38.232 --> 01:40:40.501
Expanding we just offered our

01:40:40.567 --> 01:40:41.969
first on ethical hacking class

01:40:42.035 --> 01:40:44.138
we've been offering the the the

01:40:44.204 --> 01:40:46.073
first classes in that but this

01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:47.941
is that --

01:40:48.008 --> 01:40:50.144
Ethical hacking class so I that

01:40:50.210 --> 01:40:50.778
also I think is going to be one

01:40:50.844 --> 01:40:54.014
we expand upon and are able --

01:40:54.081 --> 01:40:56.150
To show a lot of of of promise

01:40:56.216 --> 01:40:59.853
in in --

01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:00.254
Cyber security --

01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:00.587
As you know.

01:41:00.654 --> 01:41:01.755
Everywhere you go there's

01:41:01.822 --> 01:41:03.957
everybody's being hacked --

01:41:04.024 --> 01:41:05.826
And I read everything so --

01:41:05.893 --> 01:41:07.928
There's a lot of opportunity and

01:41:07.995 --> 01:41:10.097
that from from the entry level --

01:41:10.164 --> 01:41:12.299
Up is as high as you want to go.

01:41:12.366 --> 01:41:14.034
So -- Those

01:41:14.101 --> 01:41:15.803
are just a couple of the courses

01:41:15.869 --> 01:41:16.437
that were involved in in those

01:41:16.503 --> 01:41:22.042
courses were made possible --

01:41:22.109 --> 01:41:24.077
Certain the A. W. S. was made

01:41:24.144 --> 01:41:26.146
that we got through strong work

01:41:26.213 --> 01:41:26.480
force -- And

01:41:26.547 --> 01:41:27.848
the strong workforce money has

01:41:27.915 --> 01:41:30.584
been very very helpful to us the

01:41:30.651 --> 01:41:32.286
cybersecurity program was made

01:41:32.352 --> 01:41:34.188
made possible through Perkins

01:41:34.254 --> 01:41:34.455
funding.

01:41:34.521 --> 01:41:46.733
So -- That's

01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:47.301
however we coordinating the

01:41:47.367 --> 01:41:47.935
solutions --

01:41:48.001 --> 01:41:50.337
We are working again through

01:41:50.404 --> 01:41:52.105
strong work force --

01:41:52.172 --> 01:41:53.740
Where are you on strong pathways

01:41:53.807 --> 01:41:56.009
with pathways?

01:41:56.076 --> 01:41:57.644
Being --

01:41:57.711 --> 01:41:58.245
Right now we're working with

01:41:58.312 --> 01:41:59.780
that those plan is.

01:41:59.847 --> 01:42:02.349
To and to my to show students

01:42:02.416 --> 01:42:03.917
these are the possible careers

01:42:03.984 --> 01:42:04.551
that are out there this is what

01:42:04.618 --> 01:42:05.052
you would need to do.

01:42:05.118 --> 01:42:06.220
Familiarize them what is out

01:42:06.286 --> 01:42:06.887
there I think we're finding that

01:42:06.954 --> 01:42:08.255
they get to high school and I

01:42:08.322 --> 01:42:08.922
have no clue what occurred this

01:42:08.989 --> 01:42:09.923
I want to be this --

01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:11.758
But have no idea what that

01:42:11.825 --> 01:42:13.861
entails so --

01:42:13.927 --> 01:42:14.495
Try to familiarize them with

01:42:14.561 --> 01:42:15.162
with this would entail and this

01:42:15.229 --> 01:42:16.263
is the kind of career you would

01:42:16.330 --> 01:42:16.897
have this is how much money you

01:42:16.964 --> 01:42:17.731
might make and these are the

01:42:17.798 --> 01:42:18.398
kinds of classes you would need

01:42:18.465 --> 01:42:19.867

To know a lot of science and

01:42:26.106 --> 01:42:28.141
math and things change while

01:42:28.208 --> 01:42:30.143
you're still in high school.

01:42:30.210 --> 01:42:32.045
So is so is there's a lot of

01:42:32.112 --> 01:42:35.782
things that that they need to to

01:42:35.849 --> 01:42:36.283

way to try to connect to

01:43:18.792 --> 01:43:20.260

To faculty in their classes

01:44:21.922 --> 01:44:23.757
where job speaker is a software

01:44:23.824 --> 01:44:25.993
where students can post the

01:44:26.059 --> 01:44:27.961
skills they have attained.

01:44:28.028 --> 01:44:30.130
In their classes and similar --

01:44:30.197 --> 01:44:32.265
To a Jeff was talking about

01:44:32.332 --> 01:44:35.869
where you you --

01:44:35.936 --> 01:44:36.503
I took this class these are the

01:44:36.570 --> 01:44:39.773
skills I say this is the job

01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:40.374
that I'm looking for in these

01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:42.209
the skills I need a wait I see a

01:44:42.275 --> 01:44:43.910
student here has the skills.

01:44:43.977 --> 01:44:45.979
Connects the two and a so it's

01:44:46.046 --> 01:44:48.081
something that they can do on

01:44:48.148 --> 01:44:48.649
their own it's not something

01:44:48.715 --> 01:44:49.016
that we would.

01:44:49.082 --> 01:44:50.350
Require that they go through us

01:44:50.417 --> 01:44:52.586
to do so it's also something are

01:44:52.653 --> 01:44:54.521
job developer would be involved

01:44:54.588 --> 01:44:58.191
in to to try to help them. To to

01:44:58.258 --> 01:44:59.960
to coordinate that another --

01:45:00.027 --> 01:45:00.627
Thing that we're involved in is

working on that and hope that

01:45:12.372 --> 01:45:15.842
that that's going to be huge to

01:45:15.909 --> 01:45:16.376
bark at all the programs.

01:45:16.443 --> 01:45:20.147

Thank you.

01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:23.917
RO last panelist Merion humor

01:45:23.984 --> 01:45:24.584
hill was probably sick of us at

01:45:24.651 --> 01:45:26.219
this point we we see her.

01:45:26.286 --> 01:45:30.090
We we ask her to come to

01:45:30.157 --> 01:45:31.792
everything's.

01:45:31.858 --> 01:45:34.094
Thank you for being here today.

01:45:34.161 --> 01:45:36.229
Thank you very much for having

01:45:36.296 --> 01:45:38.065
me -- Night

01:45:38.131 --> 01:45:40.701
of it to share a couple things

01:45:40.767 --> 01:45:41.301
about myself because I have a

01:45:41.368 --> 01:45:41.902
connection to each of you in

01:45:41.968 --> 01:45:44.504
different ways --

01:45:44.571 --> 01:45:45.105
Currently I am the executive

01:45:45.172 --> 01:45:46.206
director propel a which is the

01:45:46.273 --> 01:45:48.075
team supporting and the

01:45:48.141 --> 01:45:48.675
implementation of our county

01:45:48.742 --> 01:45:50.444
wide strategic plan which has

01:45:50.510 --> 01:45:52.045
seven big goals the goal one is

01:45:52.112 --> 01:45:54.014
all about investing in our

01:45:54.081 --> 01:45:54.247
people.

01:45:54.314 --> 01:45:56.516
And that has to do a lot with

01:45:56.583 --> 01:45:57.184
strengthening our work force and

01:45:57.250 --> 01:45:58.151
our education systems and we

01:45:58.218 --> 01:45:59.986
have the privilege of working

01:46:00.053 --> 01:46:02.189
with our stakeholders were

01:46:02.255 --> 01:46:04.424
involved in early childhood K.

01:46:04.491 --> 01:46:05.992
through twelve with the

01:46:06.059 --> 01:46:07.928
community colleges with the

01:46:07.994 --> 01:46:12.099
excuse used other universities.

01:46:12.165 --> 01:46:14.167
At all with adult of a multi

01:46:14.234 --> 01:46:18.038
service poverty relief agency in --

01:46:18.105 --> 01:46:20.073
Assemblymember group me this is

01:46:20.140 --> 01:46:22.242
districts --

01:46:22.309 --> 01:46:22.876
Called meant to meet each need

01:46:22.943 --> 01:46:24.311
with dignity he served at that

01:46:24.377 --> 01:46:24.978
average of thirty seven thousand

01:46:25.045 --> 01:46:28.014
low income clients per month.

01:46:28.081 --> 01:46:28.615
And many of them are working

01:46:28.682 --> 01:46:32.052
poor and so I'm absolutely

01:46:32.119 --> 01:46:34.054
passionate about what it takes

01:46:34.121 --> 01:46:36.323
to lift people out of poverty

01:46:36.389 --> 01:46:40.227
were making. Twenty thousand

01:46:40.293 --> 01:46:41.995
dollars a year less.

01:46:42.062 --> 01:46:42.662
What will it take to bring them

01:46:42.729 --> 01:46:46.099
into a livable wage jobs?

01:46:46.166 --> 01:46:46.733
And so I'd like to focus my

01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:50.070
comments on adult education as a

01:46:50.137 --> 01:46:50.670
resource that is kind of a

01:46:50.737 --> 01:46:53.774
silent partner in the work force

01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:54.307
system often unrecognized

01:46:54.374 --> 01:46:55.809
unknown.

01:46:55.876 --> 01:46:57.778
And yet --

01:46:57.844 --> 01:46:58.411
For three reasons I feel like

01:46:58.478 --> 01:46:59.946
this is a a resource that is

01:47:00.013 --> 01:47:02.182
particularly well suited. To to

01:47:02.249 --> 01:47:04.017
to pulling in that particular

01:47:04.084 --> 01:47:08.054
workforce for the technical jobs

01:47:08.121 --> 01:47:09.923
that we have of the future --

01:47:09.990 --> 01:47:11.591
First of all accessibility there

01:47:11.658 --> 01:47:12.225
a lot of adult eight campuses

01:47:12.292 --> 01:47:13.960
that are in low income

01:47:14.027 --> 01:47:16.163
communities or their operating

01:47:16.229 --> 01:47:18.165
classes in local neighborhood

01:47:18.231 --> 01:47:20.167
schools where people can go this

01:47:20.233 --> 01:47:24.204
morning I checked and where I've

01:47:24.271 --> 01:47:24.604
worked at men --

01:47:24.671 --> 01:47:27.941
It would take three buses to get

01:47:28.008 --> 01:47:29.643
to the nearest community college

01:47:29.709 --> 01:47:32.245
and forty five minutes to an

01:47:32.312 --> 01:47:32.813
hour most of our clients.

01:47:32.879 --> 01:47:34.648
Came to our ESL classes are

01:47:34.714 --> 01:47:36.650
computer classes.

01:47:36.716 --> 01:47:40.453
By foot they walked where they

01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:40.821
rode bicycles.

01:47:40.887 --> 01:47:42.522
And the accessibility is really

01:47:42.589 --> 01:47:44.324
critical particular --

01:47:44.391 --> 01:47:46.193
Population.

01:47:46.259 --> 01:47:49.996
Approachability --

01:47:50.063 --> 01:47:50.697
You know for many of our clients

01:47:50.764 --> 01:47:52.065
they were immigrants from Mexico

01:47:52.132 --> 01:47:53.667
and from Central America

01:47:53.733 --> 01:47:53.967
[inaudible]

01:47:54.034 --> 01:47:58.271
And I know because I know a lot

01:47:58.338 --> 01:48:00.006
about committee colleges I know

01:48:00.073 --> 01:48:00.574
that our community colleges

01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:02.175
could meet their workforce needs.

01:48:02.242 --> 01:48:04.411
But I also know that their

01:48:04.477 --> 01:48:06.213
mentality was such that.

01:48:06.279 --> 01:48:07.948
They didn't see themselves yet

01:48:08.014 --> 01:48:08.548
as college material I'm they

01:48:08.615 --> 01:48:10.417
distancing themselves as being

01:48:10.483 --> 01:48:12.285
college but that wasn't part of

01:48:12.352 --> 01:48:13.787
their thinking.

01:48:13.854 --> 01:48:14.087
And in --

01:48:14.154 --> 01:48:16.423
Adult add this kind of that

01:48:16.489 --> 01:48:18.091
bridge that gives them

01:48:18.158 --> 01:48:20.126
confidence through an ESL

01:48:20.193 --> 01:48:21.895
program or through high school

01:48:21.962 --> 01:48:22.529
equivalency where they can say

01:48:22.596 --> 01:48:23.964
yes now I'm ready to go to a

01:48:24.030 --> 01:48:26.299
community college but that that

01:48:26.366 --> 01:48:28.134
approachability factor is a big

01:48:28.201 --> 01:48:29.970
deal -- In

01:48:30.036 --> 01:48:31.838
that community.

01:48:31.905 --> 01:48:32.372
And then affordability --

01:48:32.439 --> 01:48:35.976
Up on of the options --

01:48:36.042 --> 01:48:37.911
For career technical education

01:48:37.978 --> 01:48:38.511
adult education is the least

01:48:38.578 --> 01:48:39.846
expensive.

01:48:39.913 --> 01:48:45.752
And in many cases free at all

01:48:45.819 --> 01:48:47.954
for this particular population

01:48:48.021 --> 01:48:48.288
so -- I feel

01:48:48.355 --> 01:48:50.490
strongly that we need to do all

01:48:50.557 --> 01:48:52.058
that we can to narrow the gap

01:48:52.125 --> 01:48:54.461
between rich and poor that

01:48:54.527 --> 01:48:56.062
equity factor that's so much a

01:48:56.129 --> 01:48:57.898
part of our life here in Los

01:48:57.964 --> 01:48:58.164
Angeles.

01:48:58.231 --> 01:49:02.168
And I you know I see adult ed

01:49:02.235 --> 01:49:04.037
here in in LA for example LA

01:49:04.104 --> 01:49:04.704
unified school district which is

01:49:04.771 --> 01:49:06.139
got that one of the biggest

01:49:06.206 --> 01:49:06.706
programs for adult at in the

01:49:06.773 --> 01:49:07.741
state --

01:49:07.807 --> 01:49:12.245
Their training about thirty

01:49:12.312 --> 01:49:12.879
seven thousand students English

01:49:12.946 --> 01:49:13.213
right now --

01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:14.180
Throughout our county it's about

01:49:14.247 --> 01:49:16.216
a hundred and ten thousand

01:49:16.283 --> 01:49:16.850
students are getting ESL classes

01:49:16.917 --> 01:49:18.451
through our community colleges

01:49:18.518 --> 01:49:20.120
as well as through adult ed.

01:49:20.186 --> 01:49:22.489
But there's one point five

01:49:22.555 --> 01:49:24.257
million people are county that

01:49:24.324 --> 01:49:25.692
don't speak English for don't

01:49:25.759 --> 01:49:26.293
speak it well how do we reach

01:49:26.359 --> 01:49:28.194
them so that we can then prepare

01:49:28.261 --> 01:49:30.096
them. For those jobs of the

01:49:30.163 --> 01:49:31.898
future -- I

01:49:31.965 --> 01:49:33.833
think we really need to expand

01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:34.034
that.

01:49:34.100 --> 01:49:36.169
Apprenticeships --

01:49:36.236 --> 01:49:36.703
Adult it has the largest

01:49:36.770 --> 01:49:38.038
apprenticeship program in

01:49:38.104 --> 01:49:40.206
California with sixty one trades

01:49:40.273 --> 01:49:41.775
represented.

01:49:41.841 --> 01:49:42.275
And for that are under

01:49:42.342 --> 01:49:44.210
development seventy five hundred

01:49:44.277 --> 01:49:45.946
students.

01:49:46.012 --> 01:49:46.212
So -- So

01:49:46.279 --> 01:49:48.114
they're well positioned again to

01:49:48.181 --> 01:49:50.016
meet this particular population

01:49:50.083 --> 01:49:52.218
so my courage meant would be

01:49:52.285 --> 01:49:53.853
that we increase the adult ed

01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:56.222
block grant ABG which is AB --

01:49:56.289 --> 01:49:57.824
One oh for in the coming --

01:49:57.891 --> 01:50:01.761
Fiscal year --

01:50:01.828 --> 01:50:04.297
Of our lowest income residents

01:50:04.364 --> 01:50:06.066

01:50:36.563 --> 01:50:39.699

01:50:43.103 --> 01:50:44.537
For all the information that you

01:50:44.604 --> 01:50:46.172
provided in all of the insight --

01:50:46.239 --> 01:50:49.909
My most of my career I've worked

01:50:49.976 --> 01:50:50.310
in K. through --

01:50:50.377 --> 01:50:51.911
Twelve education and I'm really

01:50:51.978 --> 01:50:54.214
stem education and thinking

01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:57.851
about the future work force --

01:50:57.917 --> 01:50:59.586
But now as an assembly member I

01:50:59.652 --> 01:51:04.024
have constituents that. One of

01:51:04.090 --> 01:51:04.591
you know they're not the not

01:51:04.657 --> 01:51:05.792
just about the future they're

01:51:05.859 --> 01:51:07.827
thinking about the present and

01:51:07.894 --> 01:51:10.096
like adults is definitely

01:51:10.163 --> 01:51:11.698
something that I'm.

01:51:11.765 --> 01:51:16.069
If we want families to have a

01:51:16.136 --> 01:51:16.703
better life of or quality of

01:51:16.770 --> 01:51:18.471
life for children we need to

01:51:18.538 --> 01:51:19.806
think about the adults and and

01:51:19.873 --> 01:51:22.175
they're the current career and

01:51:22.242 --> 01:51:25.845
not just the children's future --

01:51:25.912 --> 01:51:26.079
In so.

01:51:26.146 --> 01:51:27.747
The is the thank everyone for

01:51:27.814 --> 01:51:28.381
being here is not just this.

01:51:28.448 --> 01:51:31.918
This issue is I'm very

01:51:31.985 --> 01:51:32.519
passionate about it to you to

01:51:32.585 --> 01:51:33.920
workforce development and

01:51:33.987 --> 01:51:35.955
especially highly skilled jobs --

01:51:36.022 --> 01:51:37.924
Into one thing.

01:51:37.991 --> 01:51:39.993
Of the Queen Mary on what you

01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:41.761
were mentioning I know we have --

01:51:41.828 --> 01:51:42.395
The connection because of the

01:51:42.462 --> 01:51:45.732
community and men --

01:51:45.799 --> 01:51:48.034
But also thinking of non English

01:51:48.101 --> 01:51:49.903
speaking adults right where.

01:51:49.969 --> 01:51:51.704
If you before thinking like --

01:51:51.771 --> 01:51:53.740
Jeffrey said about skills rate

01:51:53.807 --> 01:51:55.842
and skills do you necessarily

01:51:55.909 --> 01:51:58.078
have to speak English to develop

01:51:58.144 --> 01:52:00.013
that skill and and I know I grew

01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:02.115
up in Pacoima an I know a lot of

01:52:02.182 --> 01:52:04.050
people in the community to have

01:52:04.117 --> 01:52:05.652
skills --

01:52:05.718 --> 01:52:07.654
And are ready for the work force

01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:09.889
but the barrier is maybe taking

01:52:09.956 --> 01:52:11.891
the English class at the

01:52:11.958 --> 01:52:13.793
community college level or you

01:52:13.860 --> 01:52:14.160
know if that.

01:52:14.227 --> 01:52:18.131
What may be required and of more

01:52:18.198 --> 01:52:23.837
of the skill and so how do we?

01:52:23.903 --> 01:52:26.039
Like a badgers certify them and

01:52:26.106 --> 01:52:27.707
and the way that.

01:52:27.774 --> 01:52:29.742
Some employers they just want to

01:52:29.809 --> 01:52:31.711
hire someone that knows how.

01:52:31.778 --> 01:52:33.780
To do the particular skill has a

01:52:33.847 --> 01:52:35.915
skill read --

01:52:35.982 --> 01:52:36.249
In so -- You

01:52:36.316 --> 01:52:39.619
don't think you.

01:52:39.686 --> 01:52:41.754

01:52:43.957 --> 01:52:44.491
and and I definitely want.

01:52:44.557 --> 01:52:46.092

01:54:09.943 --> 01:54:12.345
You know when that my mom used

to state not to meet with she

01:54:14.380 --> 01:54:14.514
said.

01:54:14.581 --> 01:54:15.915
She would be out speaking and

01:54:15.982 --> 01:54:16.516
she would say you've nap to

01:54:16.583 --> 01:54:17.984
young people and she would say I

01:54:18.051 --> 01:54:18.618
promise you you've never heard

01:54:18.685 --> 01:54:19.819
of what you're going to do by

01:54:19.886 --> 01:54:21.688
the end of your career.

01:54:21.754 --> 01:54:23.756
Unfortunately for me that is not

what happen to me I heard.

01:54:25.925 --> 01:54:27.660
I had heard of this job before

01:54:27.727 --> 01:54:29.662
because she had it --

01:54:29.729 --> 01:54:32.131
But yet here we are --

01:54:32.198 --> 01:54:32.765
Will have million jobs in two

01:54:32.832 --> 01:54:33.399
thousand twenty five that will

01:54:33.466 --> 01:54:35.735
need a certificate or less to

01:54:35.802 --> 01:54:36.069
fill them --

01:54:36.135 --> 01:54:37.971
We are also at the lowest

01:54:38.037 --> 01:54:38.638
unemployment we have seen in a

01:54:38.705 --> 01:54:40.073
very long time yet we are

01:54:40.139 --> 01:54:41.941
struggling still with the

01:54:42.008 --> 01:54:42.208
highest.

01:54:42.275 --> 01:54:43.910
Poverty and obviously each one

01:54:43.977 --> 01:54:45.678
of our panelists are doing

01:54:45.745 --> 01:54:46.312
incredible work toward making

01:54:46.379 --> 01:54:48.248
sure that that no longer that

01:54:48.314 --> 01:54:49.916
continues to be the case --

01:54:49.983 --> 01:54:50.550
We are past the point of wanting

01:54:50.617 --> 01:54:54.287
peace it is now coming on us to

01:54:54.354 --> 01:54:56.022

real career some real

01:54:59.792 --> 01:55:02.028
opportunity and I want to think

01:55:02.095 --> 01:55:03.696
everyone on the panel for the

01:55:03.763 --> 01:55:04.163

never reva said which is.

01:55:12.005 --> 01:55:14.340
The hopes of today are that
