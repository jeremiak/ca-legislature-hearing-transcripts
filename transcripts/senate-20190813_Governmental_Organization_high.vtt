THIS NUMBER IS FAR HIGHER THAN

00:00:46.846 --> 00:00:48.515
THE CURRENT AVERAGE OF EIGHTY

00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:49.916
THOUSAND HOMES PER YEAR THAT

WHY THIS IS A FIRST OF ITS KIND

00:03:40.954 --> 00:03:43.356
PROPERTY INVENTORY SO A LITTLE

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:45.892
BACKGROUND THE STATE STATUTORY

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:46.993
FRAMEWORK FOR PROPERTY I'M

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.927
PAINTING WITH A BROAD BRUSH

00:03:47.994 --> 00:03:51.397
HERE IS PRETTY SIMPLE. STATE OF

00:03:51.464 --> 00:03:52.465
CALIFORNIA OWNS PROPERTY AND

00:03:52.532 --> 00:03:53.800
THE PROPERTY IS INVESTED WITH

00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:56.035
DEPARTMENT PRESSED TO UTILIZE

00:03:56.102 --> 00:03:58.237
THAT PROPERTY IN FURTHERANCE OF

00:03:58.304 --> 00:04:00.940
THEIR MISSION SO DMD FOR

00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:02.575
EXAMPLE DMV OWNS A DMB DOES NOT

00:04:02.642 --> 00:04:03.910
APPLY LENDS THAT CALIFORNIA

00:04:03.977 --> 00:04:05.812
OWNS A PLOT OF LAND THAT LAND

00:04:05.878 --> 00:04:08.815
IS ENTRUSTED TO DMB. TO UTILIZE

00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:12.185
IT FOR SAY A FIELD OFFICE. AND

00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:12.785
IT'S UNDER THEIR JURISDICTIONS

00:04:12.852 --> 00:04:13.820
OPERATIONAL CONTROL. AT SOME

00:04:13.886 --> 00:04:14.821
POINT IN TIME THOUGH THAT LAND

00:04:14.887 --> 00:04:16.489
NO LONGER SERVICES THEIR NEEDS

00:04:16.556 --> 00:04:18.191
MAY BE THEIR CONSTITUENTS

00:04:18.257 --> 00:04:20.860
CHANGE MAY BE THE CITY HAS

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:22.262
MOVED A LITTLE BIT NORTHWARD

00:04:22.328 --> 00:04:23.129
MAYBE NEED A BIGGER OFFICE

00:04:23.196 --> 00:04:24.931
WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE THAT

00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:26.799
PROPERTY NO LONGER SERVICES

00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:27.834
THEIR NEEDS. AND THEY WOULD

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.336
THEN DECLARE ACCESS ONCE A

00:04:30.403 --> 00:04:31.170
DEPARTMENT DECLARED PROPERTY TO

00:04:31.237 --> 00:04:32.105
BE EXCESS AGAIN IT'S REALLY

00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:33.573
DUMB SAYING. THIS PROPERTY

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.408
STILL BELONG THE STATE SHOULD

00:04:35.475 --> 00:04:37.076
BE STATE PROPERTY BUT WE DON'T

00:04:37.143 --> 00:04:39.345
NEED IT ANYMORE. TGS GETS

00:04:39.412 --> 00:04:40.279
TAGGED TO COME IN AND

00:04:40.346 --> 00:04:42.415
FACILITATE A- OF THE BEGINNING

00:04:42.482 --> 00:04:43.449
OF A DISPOSITION PROCESS AND

00:04:43.516 --> 00:04:45.118
THE INITIAL STEPS AND STATURE

00:04:45.184 --> 00:04:46.486
SENSUALLY ARE TO LOOK AT OTHER

00:04:46.552 --> 00:04:49.022
STATE. READ THIS. MAYBE DMB

00:04:49.088 --> 00:04:49.889
DOESN'T NEED IT A. B. C. H. P.

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:51.624
DOES MAYBE E. D. TO. THOSE

00:04:51.691 --> 00:04:52.592
SORTS OF THINGS WE ALSO CAN

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:54.661
LOOK AT LONG TERM LEASING

00:04:54.727 --> 00:04:56.596
DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE

00:04:56.663 --> 00:04:58.064
PROPERTY AND- WHETHER IT'S

00:04:58.131 --> 00:05:00.066
NEEDED. NOW MAYBE NOT BUT MAYBE

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:00.800
IN THE FUTURE AT SOME POINT

00:05:00.867 --> 00:05:02.235
TIME WE DON'T WANNA GET RID OF

00:05:02.301 --> 00:05:03.036
THE PROPERTY WE CAN ENTER TO

00:05:03.102 --> 00:05:04.303
SOME SORT OF MEDIUM OR LONG

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.838
TERM LEAST TO SORT OF. CONTINUE

00:05:05.905 --> 00:05:08.875
UTILIZATION. BUT IN THE DAY. WE

00:05:08.941 --> 00:05:10.076
START LOOKING AT EITHER STATE

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:12.645
RE USE OR OR LEASING. ONCE THAT

00:05:12.712 --> 00:05:15.415
FAILS. IF THAT FAILS I WOULD

00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:18.151
SAY FOR MOST PARTS. PROPERTIES

00:05:18.217 --> 00:05:19.318
OFTEN TRANSFERRED OTHER STATE

00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:21.988
AGENCIES IT IS MOST COMMON.

00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:24.991
THAT DO A NUMBER OF FACTORS

00:05:25.058 --> 00:05:32.865
THEY THEN GO TO THE NEXT THE.

00:05:32.932 --> 00:05:33.332
PROCESS OF. GOING TO A

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:37.370
DIFFERENT AGENCY. IS AN THE

00:05:37.437 --> 00:05:42.308
CARD. THE LEGISLATURE. AT THAT

00:05:42.375 --> 00:05:43.409
POINT IN TIME THE STATE IS

00:05:43.476 --> 00:05:43.976
AUTHORIZED TO POTENTIALLY A

00:05:44.043 --> 00:05:44.577
SAID THERE'S NO LAW FIRST. AS

00:05:44.644 --> 00:05:45.144
THE STATE'S AUTHORIZED TO

00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:46.312
DISPOSITION THE PROPERTY IN A

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:47.313
VARIETY OF WAYS WERE THAT

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.549
SAILED TRANSFERS EXCHANGE

00:05:49.615 --> 00:05:50.183
ACOSTA LEAST AND DO THINGS LIKE

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:50.783
THAT WE CAN STILL GIVE IT TO A

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:51.417
STATE DEPARTMENT. AVENUE NEED

00:05:51.484 --> 00:05:52.518
COMES UP BUT FOR THE MOST PART

00:05:52.585 --> 00:05:53.086
WANT SOMETHING A SURPLUS FOR

00:05:53.152 --> 00:05:53.720
AUTHORIZED TO DISPOSE OF IT NOW

00:05:53.786 --> 00:05:54.854
IN THE IN WHATEVER WAY BENEFITS

00:05:54.921 --> 00:05:55.855
THE STATE. THIS IS THE FOR THE

00:05:55.922 --> 00:05:57.023
FRAMEWORK PROCESS AND EVERY

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.658
YEAR DEPARTMENTS TYPICALLY

00:05:58.725 --> 00:06:00.126
DECLARE SOME NUMBER OF

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:03.162
PROPERTIES BE ACCESS. BUT IT

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:05.732
MIGHT BE ONE MIGHT BE TO FORCE

00:06:05.798 --> 00:06:07.200
A REALLY GOOD YEAR THERE'S NOT

00:06:07.266 --> 00:06:07.800
A WHOLE. WE WERE WE GET THE-

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:08.935
CAR IN THE ACCESS. TO THE

EXECUTIVE ORDER SAID WAS LET'S

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.672
GO TAKE A PROACTIVE LOOK

00:06:12.739 --> 00:06:13.706
REGARDLESS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:06:13.773 --> 00:06:15.842
DECLARING LET'S REALLY DIG INTO

00:06:15.908 --> 00:06:17.677
WHAT PROPERTIES ARE OUT THERE

00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:19.512
WHAT MIGHT BE UNDER UTILIZED

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:21.481
WERE NOT BEING UTILIZED AT ALL

00:06:21.547 --> 00:06:23.082

AND- REINVIGORATED FOR HOUSING.

00:06:25.284 --> 00:06:27.854
I SHOULD KNOW TO. IN THE SUCH

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.055
STORES FOR SURPLUS POSSIBLE

00:06:29.122 --> 00:06:34.594

ALL TALK ABOUT THE RESULTS OF

00:06:44.036 --> 00:06:44.904
THAT LOOKING ALL TALK ABOUT

00:06:44.971 --> 00:06:45.538
KIND OF HOW WE APPROACHED IN A

00:06:45.605 --> 00:06:46.506

00:06:53.946 --> 00:06:54.714
JUST KIND OF BACK TO THIS LINE

00:06:54.781 --> 00:06:57.450
HIGHLIGHTS IT DOES REQUIRE A

00:06:57.517 --> 00:06:59.252
VERY SYSTEMATIC AN OBJECTIVE

00:06:59.318 --> 00:07:01.420
APPROACH THE PROPERTY WE DID

00:07:01.487 --> 00:07:03.623
APPROACH THIS LIKE A FINAL AND

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:04.657
I THINK IT'LL BE MADE CLEAR AS

00:07:04.724 --> 00:07:06.859
THE PRESENTATION CONTINUES BUT

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:09.061
IT ALSO TALKS ABOUT HOW WE GO

00:07:09.128 --> 00:07:12.932
ABOUT DEVELOPING SO IT FOCUSES

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:14.300
ON INNOVATIVE CONSTRUCTION

00:07:14.367 --> 00:07:16.402
APPROACHES WHETHER THAT

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:17.570
SUSTAINABLE PRO WORKFORCE

00:07:17.637 --> 00:07:19.005
CENTER FOR. EQUITABLE PRO

00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:24.210
APPROACH IT DOES. ON ON

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:28.648
PARTNERSHIP OF THE PRINCE. IT'S

00:07:28.714 --> 00:07:29.248
PLAYED OUT SO FAR AND HOW THAT

00:07:29.315 --> 00:07:30.449
WILL PLAY OUT IN THE AND IT

00:07:30.516 --> 00:07:31.984
REALLY DOES FOCUS ON EXPEDITED

00:07:32.051 --> 00:07:33.986
DEVELOPMENTS. THERE'S NO WAY

00:07:34.053 --> 00:07:34.987
YOU WHATEVER THE FINAL NUMBER

00:07:35.054 --> 00:07:35.922
OF UP TO. BE THAT THEY'RE ALL

00:07:35.988 --> 00:07:36.522
GONNA HAPPEN AT ONCE THIS IS

00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:37.123
GONNA BE A PERIOD OF TIME BUT

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:37.857
OBVIOUSLY IN OUR PRIORITIZATION

00:07:37.924 --> 00:07:38.891
EFFORTS WERE FOCUSING ON THE

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:39.525
THINGS THAT CAN GET DONE SOONER

00:07:39.592 --> 00:07:42.094
THAN LATER. SO WE CAN GET AS

00:07:42.161 --> 00:07:42.728
MUCH BUILT IN THE SHORT TERM AS

00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:44.997
WELL AS THE MEDIUM TO LONG TERM.

00:07:45.064 --> 00:07:46.265
SO WHAT. WE'VE DONE AND WHERE

00:07:46.332 --> 00:07:48.267
WE GOING. SO THE INITIAL

00:07:48.334 --> 00:07:50.069
INVENTORY AS SENATOR ROBB

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:51.604
MENTIONED WAS INITIALLY

00:07:51.671 --> 00:07:54.740
COMPLETED. 440-003-0070 PARCELS

00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:56.609
USING COUNTY ASSESSOR DATA WERE

00:07:56.676 --> 00:07:58.744
VISUALLY LOOKED AT WITH A TEAM

00:07:58.811 --> 00:07:59.512
OF NINE PEOPLE DEDICATED FOR

00:07:59.579 --> 00:08:00.313
THREE MONTHS DOING EXACTLY

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:02.615
THAT. THEY PULLED A SHEET FILES

00:08:02.682 --> 00:08:04.217
WHICH ARE BASICALLY VISUAL.

00:08:04.283 --> 00:08:06.619
VIEWS THE PARCELS. AND THEY

00:08:06.686 --> 00:08:08.020
WERE LOOKING FOR UTILIZATION.

00:08:08.087 --> 00:08:09.822
OR LACK THERE OF. AND THEY WERE

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:14.060
LOOKING FOR PRETTY LIBERAL.

00:08:14.126 --> 00:08:15.862
FACTORS THAT INDICATE THE

00:08:15.928 --> 00:08:17.330
HOUSING MIGHT BE VIABLE THERE

00:08:17.396 --> 00:08:18.664
SO IT'S A LITTLE FACTORS I MEAN

00:08:18.731 --> 00:08:20.066
WE DELIBERATELY TRY TO PULL IN

00:08:20.132 --> 00:08:21.367
MORE. PROPERTIES THAN BEING IN

00:08:21.434 --> 00:08:23.636
A- FORM EXCLUSIONARY THAT PUT

00:08:23.703 --> 00:08:25.438
IN THE PROCESS. SO IF SOMETHING

00:08:25.504 --> 00:08:26.305
WAS. WATER LITERALLY IT'S

00:08:26.372 --> 00:08:29.208
OBVIOUSLY NOW. IF SOMETHING'S

00:08:29.275 --> 00:08:29.976
IN THE MOUNTAINS SOMEWHERE IN

00:08:30.042 --> 00:08:31.878
THE FOREST IS OBVIOUSLY NO BUT

00:08:31.944 --> 00:08:33.913
IF. YOU KNOW IN A IN A QUOTE.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.047
FOR URBAN AREA CRITICALLY

00:08:35.114 --> 00:08:40.086
SOMETHING THAT'S THE. LEAST

00:08:40.152 --> 00:08:40.686
GENERALLY CLOSE TO RESIDENTIAL

00:08:40.753 --> 00:08:44.023
HE GOT INCLUDED IN. KIND OF

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:44.624
MAKING A VENN DIAGRAM IN YOUR

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:45.391
HEADS IT'S WHERE DOES PROPERTY

00:08:45.458 --> 00:08:46.125
SEEM TO BE UNDER UTILIZED. AND

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:46.959
THEN WHERE DOES DEVELOPMENT

00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:47.660
SEEM TO BE VIABLE FROM HIGH

00:08:47.727 --> 00:08:49.595
LEVEL WE DID EXCLUDE PARCELS

00:08:49.662 --> 00:08:51.230
THAT WERE REALLY REALLY

00:08:51.297 --> 00:08:52.365
TERRIBLY GRADED SO YEAH HUGE

00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:53.266
SLOPES THINGS LIKE THAT THINGS

00:08:53.332 --> 00:08:55.534
THAT WOULD MAKE DEVELOPMENTS

00:08:55.601 --> 00:08:56.903
MORE EXPENSIVE. OR LESS LIKELY

00:08:56.969 --> 00:09:00.339
TO OCCUR. FOR THE MOST PART

00:09:00.406 --> 00:09:00.907
THIS WAS A PRETTY BIG BROAD

00:09:00.973 --> 00:09:04.677
GRAB. AFTER THAT PIECE WAS DONE

00:09:04.744 --> 00:09:06.412
AND CONCURRENT TO THE INVENTORY

00:09:06.479 --> 00:09:07.680
TGS HD WERE DEVELOPING A

00:09:07.747 --> 00:09:09.448
SCREENING TOOL. THAT SCREENING

00:09:09.515 --> 00:09:10.549
TOOL IN THERE'S A SLIGHT ON IT

00:09:10.616 --> 00:09:12.285
COMING UP WAS NOT MEANT TO

00:09:12.351 --> 00:09:14.186
ELIMINATE THE PARCELS SO MUCH

00:09:14.253 --> 00:09:15.655
AS IT WAS STUCK TO HELP US KIND

00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:18.090
OF PRIORITIZE THEM. AND I

00:09:18.157 --> 00:09:19.625
UNDERSTAND WHERE HOUSING MIGHT

00:09:19.692 --> 00:09:22.428
BE MORE OR LESS VIABLE. FOR

00:09:22.495 --> 00:09:23.562
PICK ASIDE OVER AGAINST ANOTHER

00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:27.099
ONE. AFTER THAT WAS DONE THE

00:09:27.166 --> 00:09:28.868
NEXT BIG STEP AND THE MOST

00:09:28.935 --> 00:09:30.069
DAUNTING I THINK WAS THE

00:09:30.136 --> 00:09:31.504
DEPARTMENTAL BETTING SO WHAT

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:33.239
THAT MEANS IS. IN A WEEK WE

00:09:33.306 --> 00:09:34.774
LOOK AT A SITE AND WE HAVE A

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:35.775
PIECE OF PROPERTY THAT LOOKS

00:09:35.841 --> 00:09:37.109
LIKE IT'S EMINENTLY DEVELOP

00:09:37.176 --> 00:09:39.445
HOLE. WE'VE SCREENED IT'S AND

00:09:39.512 --> 00:09:40.246
IT MEETS A LOT OF THE FACTORS

00:09:40.313 --> 00:09:41.981
THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT TO SEE A

00:09:42.048 --> 00:09:42.848
GOOD AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:09:42.915 --> 00:09:44.483
DEVELOPMENT TO NEED TO HAVE IN

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:48.287
ORDER TO BE DEVELOPED. BUT WE

00:09:48.354 --> 00:09:48.754
TALK TO THE DEPARTMENT

00:09:48.821 --> 00:09:51.424
ULTIMATELY ABOUT IT. WE NEED TO

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:52.425
ASK WHETHER OR NOT THAT SITE

00:09:52.491 --> 00:09:53.025
HAD ANY SORT OF ENCUMBRANCES

00:09:53.092 --> 00:09:53.459
THAT WOULD PRECLUDE

00:09:53.526 --> 00:09:55.461
DEVELOPMENT. MAYBE OVER THE

00:09:55.528 --> 00:09:56.662
LAST THIRTY YEARS THERE HAVE

00:09:56.729 --> 00:09:57.830
BEEN YOU KNOW. A LONG TERM

00:09:57.897 --> 00:09:59.565
EASEMENTS GRANTED TO PRIVATE

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:01.667
SECTOR ENTITIES THE LOCALS. TO

00:10:01.734 --> 00:10:02.969
RUN UTILITIES THROUGHOUT THEIR

00:10:03.035 --> 00:10:03.836
THAT WOULD BE REALLY EXPENSIVE

00:10:03.903 --> 00:10:05.705
TO MOVE OR MAYBE. THE PROPERTY

00:10:05.771 --> 00:10:07.773
HAS A MEDIATION ISSUES OR MAYBE

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.375
THE PROPERTY WAS A SHE TO THE

00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:10.543
STATE TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO FOR

00:10:10.609 --> 00:10:12.478
A VERY SPECIFIC PURPOSE. AND

00:10:12.545 --> 00:10:13.546
WOULD REQUIRE A CHANGE IN

00:10:13.612 --> 00:10:16.649
STATUTE TO. ALTER ITS USE. WE

00:10:16.716 --> 00:10:17.717
DIDN'T KNOW THOSE THINGS

00:10:17.783 --> 00:10:19.118
INITIAL INVENTORY AND SO ALL

00:10:19.185 --> 00:10:21.587
THE SITES THAT WE THEN.

00:10:21.654 --> 00:10:23.022
IDENTIFIED AS PART OF THAT

00:10:23.089 --> 00:10:24.123
THIRTEEN AND THIRTY PARCELS

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.591
WHERE THAN VETTED WITH

00:10:25.658 --> 00:10:28.394
APARTMENTS. FROM THERE. WE GOT

00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:30.596
DOWN TO A SMALLER NUMBER OF

00:10:30.663 --> 00:10:31.831
SITES THAT DEPARTMENTS HAVE

00:10:31.897 --> 00:10:34.767
SAID YES WE AGREE. THIS COULD

00:10:34.834 --> 00:10:36.402
OR SHOULD BE DECLARED ACCESS WE

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:37.570
NO LONGER NEEDED THERE ARE

00:10:37.636 --> 00:10:38.804
KNOWN CONFERENCES ON THE SITE

00:10:38.871 --> 00:10:39.638
THAT WOULD PRECLUDE

00:10:39.705 --> 00:10:41.107
DEVELOPMENT. WE ARE FINE WITH

00:10:41.173 --> 00:10:42.842
THESE BEING DECLARED ACCESSING

00:10:42.908 --> 00:10:44.844
GOING THROUGH. THE REST OF

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:46.278
EXECUTIVE ORDER PROCESS I

00:10:46.345 --> 00:10:48.581
SHOULD SHOULD KNOW THEIR- JUST

00:10:48.647 --> 00:10:51.484
A SEC OF POSTERITY THAT WHEN WE

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:56.288
DO POLICY SITES. I'M SURE SURE

00:10:56.355 --> 00:10:56.889
THERE'S GOING TO BE A SITE OR

00:10:56.956 --> 00:10:59.925
TWO OR SEVEN. EACH OF YOUR

00:10:59.992 --> 00:11:01.027
DISTRICTS THAT WHERE YOU'RE CAN

00:11:01.093 --> 00:11:02.094
BE CONFUSED AS TO WHY IT'S NOT

00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:04.263
ON THE LIST BECAUSE YOU. ABSENT

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.031
SURE THAT IT WASN'T UTILIZED

00:11:05.097 --> 00:11:05.664
APPROPRIATELY OR WHATEVER ELSE

00:11:05.731 --> 00:11:06.399
THE CASE MAY BE. THERE ARE

00:11:06.465 --> 00:11:07.366
THERE ARE THOSE AND WE'LL TALK

00:11:07.433 --> 00:11:08.501
ABOUT HOW WE KIND OF WANNA

00:11:08.567 --> 00:11:09.168
WELCOME THAT FEEDBACK COMING

00:11:09.235 --> 00:11:11.070
SOON. BUT THE SIMPLE IN TIME

00:11:11.137 --> 00:11:11.604
YOU KNOW THERE'S A THERE'S

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:12.238
APPEALS PROCESS WHICH ARE GOING

00:11:12.304 --> 00:11:12.805
TO DEPARTMENTS OR SOMETHING

00:11:12.872 --> 00:11:13.639
THAT WILL OBVIOUSLY BE GOING

00:11:13.706 --> 00:11:14.440
AND WORKING WITH THEM ON AND

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:16.542
CHALLENGING A LITTLE BIT BUT-

00:11:16.609 --> 00:11:17.109
FOR THE MOST PART THE SITES

00:11:17.176 --> 00:11:17.777
THAT WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT

00:11:17.843 --> 00:11:19.211
RELEASED THE INVENTORY WE HAVE.

00:11:19.278 --> 00:11:20.079
ARE BASED ON ALL OF THOSE

00:11:20.146 --> 00:11:21.680
INITIAL YESES AGAIN WE'RE KIND

00:11:21.747 --> 00:11:23.149
OF FOCUSING ON SPEED WHAT WE

00:11:23.215 --> 00:11:24.583
CAN GET OUT FIRST. WHILE WE

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:27.053
LOOK AT A MEDIUM AND LONG TERM.

00:11:27.119 --> 00:11:31.257
ROLL OUT PLAN. SO AFTER BERMAN

00:11:31.323 --> 00:11:32.925
VETTING WHICH IS DONE. THE NEXT

00:11:32.992 --> 00:11:34.427
TWO BIG STEPS FOR US WERE SITE

00:11:34.493 --> 00:11:35.761
PRIVATIZATION AND DEVELOPMENT

00:11:35.828 --> 00:11:37.163
OF A HEAT MAP. THE EXECUTIVE

00:11:37.229 --> 00:11:39.065
ORDER ULTIMATELY CALLS FOR THE

00:11:39.131 --> 00:11:40.599
PUBLICATION OF A MAP THAT SHOWS

00:11:40.666 --> 00:11:42.735
THE AVAILABLE ACCESS SITES.

00:11:42.802 --> 00:11:45.037
SUPERIMPOSED WITH A MAP THAT

00:11:45.104 --> 00:11:46.572
SHOWS WHERE HOUSING IS

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:48.107
GENERALLY NEEDED. SO AGAIN

00:11:48.174 --> 00:11:49.442
GOING BACK TO THAT AND DIAGRAM

00:11:49.508 --> 00:11:51.077
YOU COULD SAY. HERE'S NAPA

00:11:51.143 --> 00:11:52.211
COUNTY HERE THE- FAX NUMBER OF

00:11:52.278 --> 00:11:53.879
SITES AVAILABLE NAPA COUNTY.

00:11:53.946 --> 00:11:55.347
AND HERE'S THOSE PORTIONS NAPA

00:11:55.414 --> 00:11:57.450
COUNTY WHERE. HOUSING IS NEEDED

00:11:57.516 --> 00:12:00.186
IN PLACES WHERE IT'S NEED LESS.

00:12:00.252 --> 00:12:01.954
SO BE A QUICK EASY VISUAL FOR

00:12:02.021 --> 00:12:03.055
GOING TO KIND OF SEE AND

00:12:03.122 --> 00:12:05.558
HOPEFULLY. YOU KNOW A CHECK ON

00:12:05.624 --> 00:12:06.092
US AS TO WHERE WE'RE GONNA

00:12:06.158 --> 00:12:08.260
PRIORITIZE. DEVELOPMENTS THE

00:12:08.327 --> 00:12:10.830
PUBLICATION. OF THE HEAT MAP.

00:12:10.896 --> 00:12:15.768
IS FORTHCOMING. AND THEN AT

00:12:15.835 --> 00:12:19.572
THAT POINT. WHAT KIND OF

00:12:19.638 --> 00:12:20.906
CONCURRENT TO IT WE NEED TO DO

00:12:20.973 --> 00:12:22.975
A NUMBER OF REALISTIC TO

00:12:23.042 --> 00:12:23.843
DILIGENCE STEPS SO RATHER THAN

00:12:23.909 --> 00:12:24.910
ISSUE ARE PEAS SORT OF SIGHT

00:12:24.977 --> 00:12:27.746
UNSEEN WE- ASKED FOR AND

00:12:27.813 --> 00:12:29.415
RECEIVED FUNDING IN THE LAST

00:12:29.482 --> 00:12:32.418
BUDGET CYCLE. TO DO SORT OF

00:12:32.485 --> 00:12:33.819
PREDELLA WORK SO WE WOULD BE

00:12:33.886 --> 00:12:35.921
HIRING A REALISTIC CONSULTANT

00:12:35.988 --> 00:12:37.123
TO COME OUT AND DO AN ECONOMIC

00:12:37.189 --> 00:12:38.524
ANALYSIS ON A MITCHELL SITES.

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:39.992
HELP MAKE SURE THERE ARE PEAS

00:12:40.059 --> 00:12:43.195
ARE TAILORED TO THE PARTICULAR

00:12:43.262 --> 00:12:44.964
DOUBLE ABILITY OF A PARTICULAR

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:47.032
SITE WE ALSO WANT TO DO LIKE A

00:12:47.099 --> 00:12:48.033
FIRE ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.235
PHASE ONE ASSESSMENT. THE

00:12:49.301 --> 00:12:52.037
MANAGER TECHNICAL TESTING PULL

00:12:52.104 --> 00:12:54.173
TYLER POURED VALIDATE THAT THE

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.941
PROPERTY BOUNDARIES THINGS LIKE

00:12:56.008 --> 00:12:59.145
THAT SO THAT WE KNOW TO WORRY

00:12:59.211 --> 00:12:59.745
REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF DOING

00:12:59.812 --> 00:13:02.982
IN OUR P. FINDING. SOMETHING

00:13:03.048 --> 00:13:03.883
THAT WOULD DEVELOP. MAKE SURE

00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:04.984
THAT WE GO OUT WITH HIS HAS

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:05.484
TEED UP AS POSSIBLE FOR

00:13:05.551 --> 00:13:07.153
DEVELOPERS TO. BUILD AND THEN

00:13:07.219 --> 00:13:08.787
OF COURSE THE FINAL STEP IN THE

00:13:08.854 --> 00:13:09.922
PROCESS IS THE ISSUE INSOFAR AS

00:13:09.989 --> 00:13:13.792
PEACE. TO REALLY WE ARE. YOU

00:13:13.859 --> 00:13:15.161
KNOW VERY VERY CLOSE TO THE

00:13:15.227 --> 00:13:16.562
PUBLICATION HEAT MAP AND THE

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:18.430
LAST TWO STEPS. THE REALISTIC

00:13:18.497 --> 00:13:20.799
YOU DILIGENCE AND THE ACTIONS

00:13:20.866 --> 00:13:21.367
OF THEIR FEES ARE WE HAVE IN

00:13:21.433 --> 00:13:23.636
FRONT OF US. THE SEPTEMBER

00:13:23.702 --> 00:13:25.004
DEADLINE THAT WAS MENTIONED

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:27.006
EARLIER WITH THERE IS A

00:13:27.072 --> 00:13:28.507
DEADLINE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO

00:13:28.574 --> 00:13:30.276
ISSUE AT LEAST THE FIRST. SET

00:13:30.342 --> 00:13:32.077
OF OUR PEAS BY THE END OF

00:13:32.144 --> 00:13:33.078
SEPTEMBER. WE ARE ON TRACK TO

00:13:33.145 --> 00:13:36.448
DO THAT AGAIN THIS IS GONNA RUN

00:13:36.515 --> 00:13:37.583
WAVES THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:38.851
YOU KNOW. TWO HUNDRED OUR KEYS

00:13:38.918 --> 00:13:40.419
AT ONCE IT'S GOING TO BE SOME

00:13:40.486 --> 00:13:41.654
NUMBER OF THEM WE WANT TO MAKE

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.789
SURE THAT WE ARE LOVED.

00:13:43.856 --> 00:13:44.990
LEARNING OUR LESSONS

00:13:45.057 --> 00:13:46.425
EFFECTIVELY WE WANNA MAKE SURE

00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:47.660
THAT AS WE GET OUR PEACE OUT

00:13:47.726 --> 00:13:49.828
AND WE GET RESPONSES. THINGS

00:13:49.895 --> 00:13:50.930
ARE GONNA GO RIGHT THINGS ARE

00:13:50.996 --> 00:13:52.064
GONNA GO WRONG WE WANNA LEARN

00:13:52.131 --> 00:13:53.132
FROM THOSE AS OPPOSED TO DOING

00:13:53.199 --> 00:13:55.134
A MASSIVE WAVE OF THINGS. AND

00:13:55.201 --> 00:13:57.002
KIND OF. FINDING OUT THERE SOME

00:13:57.069 --> 00:13:58.470
FATAL FLAW IN THEM. THE OTHER

00:13:58.537 --> 00:13:59.805
ELEMENT TO I THINK IS IMPORTANT

00:13:59.872 --> 00:14:01.006
IS ALSO LIMITED STAFF TO PASS

00:14:01.073 --> 00:14:04.376
SITTING SO WHERE CONNECTING TO

00:14:04.443 --> 00:14:07.012
DO THAT. AS WELL JUDICIOUSLY.

00:14:07.079 --> 00:14:08.747
SO OUR INVENTORY. 440-003-0070

00:14:08.814 --> 00:14:11.050
PARCELLS AGAIN VISUAL REVIEW WE

00:14:11.116 --> 00:14:13.185
LOOKED AT GRADING UTILIZATION.

00:14:13.252 --> 00:14:15.087
ADJACENT SEES AGAIN IS AN EXTRA

00:14:15.154 --> 00:14:16.689
RESIDENTIAL IS THERE APPEAR TO

00:14:16.755 --> 00:14:19.158
BE. AMENITIES THAT WOULD BE

00:14:19.225 --> 00:14:22.127
SUPPORTIVE OF HOUSING. AGAIN IN

00:14:22.194 --> 00:14:22.661
A PRETTY BROAD VERY LITTLE

00:14:22.728 --> 00:14:25.097
SENSE. WE DID ALSO LOOK AT

00:14:25.164 --> 00:14:25.931
ALTERNATE DEVELOPMENT

00:14:25.998 --> 00:14:27.433
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE MOST PART

00:14:27.499 --> 00:14:28.300
AND WE FLAG SOME PROPERTIES

00:14:28.367 --> 00:14:30.970
THAT ARE ON THE BORDERLINE WE

00:14:31.036 --> 00:14:32.004
ALSO LOOKED AT PROPERTIES THAT

00:14:32.071 --> 00:14:35.574
HAD SOME DEGREE OF UTILIZATION.

00:14:35.641 --> 00:14:37.309
BUT WE'RE BOB OWNED BUT OR BY

00:14:37.376 --> 00:14:38.978
OPERATED BY DEPARTMENTS WHO

00:14:39.044 --> 00:14:39.945
HAVE A HISTORY OF TURNING

00:14:40.012 --> 00:14:41.146
PROPERTIES OVER SO YOU SEE AGE

00:14:41.213 --> 00:14:43.182
PETER DMV'S MAKING SURE THAT

00:14:43.249 --> 00:14:44.516
THOSE SITES FOR LOOK AT PRETTY

00:14:44.583 --> 00:14:46.752
HARD. THAT DID GET DOWN TO

00:14:46.819 --> 00:14:47.553
ABOUT THIRTEEN HER THIRTY

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:50.389
PARCELS WE THEN STOPPED USING

00:14:50.456 --> 00:14:54.026
THE PARCEL DOCUMENT DESIGNATION

00:14:54.093 --> 00:14:54.593
WE START LOOKING AT SITES SO

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:57.630
FOR EXAMPLE. CAPITOL PARK HERE

00:14:57.696 --> 00:14:58.163
THIS IS NOT ONE PIECE OF

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:00.332
PROPERTY FROM AND L. INTENT

00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:01.467
THAN FIFTEEN THAT'S MADE UP OF

00:15:01.533 --> 00:15:03.602
MORTAL PARCELS. AND SO RATHER

00:15:03.669 --> 00:15:04.970
THAN KIND OF TALKING THIS

00:15:05.037 --> 00:15:07.106
PARCEL DEMARCATION AND GETTING

00:15:07.172 --> 00:15:10.609
FOLKS MAYBE MISLEADING AS TO

00:15:10.676 --> 00:15:11.510
HOW MANY PROPERTIES ARE OUT

00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:12.845
THERE WE STARTED SAYING LET'S

00:15:12.911 --> 00:15:13.979
LET'S GROUP THESE THINGS

00:15:14.046 --> 00:15:14.880
TOGETHER IN TERMS OF WHAT WILL

00:15:14.947 --> 00:15:17.182
BE ACTUALLY DOUBLE DOUBLE. AS

00:15:17.249 --> 00:15:18.717
WE STARTED USING SITES AS THE

00:15:18.784 --> 00:15:20.619
TERM THOSE THIRTEEN AND THIRTY

00:15:20.686 --> 00:15:23.455
PARCELS NATURALLY COALESCED

00:15:23.522 --> 00:15:24.023
INTO ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND

00:15:24.089 --> 00:15:26.558
FIFTY SITES. AND THEN WE WENT

00:15:26.625 --> 00:15:28.227
THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:15:28.294 --> 00:15:29.728
VETTING PROCESS AND RIGHT NOW

00:15:29.795 --> 00:15:31.163
WE'RE SITTING IN A ABOUT A

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:33.899
HUNDRED SITES. THAT HAD GOTTEN

00:15:33.966 --> 00:15:35.100
YES IS NO WHICH IS THAT'S A

00:15:35.167 --> 00:15:36.568
HUNDRED MORE THAN HE STARTED

00:15:36.635 --> 00:15:38.070
WITH WHICH IS FANTASTIC. THAT

00:15:38.137 --> 00:15:40.506
NUMBER'S GONNA FLUCTUATES AND I

00:15:40.572 --> 00:15:41.874
CAN ALMOST PROMISE THAT IT'S

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:42.975
GONNA FLUCTUATE BECAUSE OF SOME

00:15:43.042 --> 00:15:44.677
THOSE APPEALS I MENTIONED IT'S

00:15:44.743 --> 00:15:47.913
GOING TO FLUCTUATE BECAUSE- WE

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.716
ARE ALSO KINDA DOING OVERLAYS

00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:53.852
OF. YOU STATE HAZARD MAPS AND

00:15:53.919 --> 00:15:56.789
THINGS LIKE THAT IT'S GOING TO

00:15:56.855 --> 00:15:59.858
FLUCTUATE BECAUSE OF. LOCAL TO

00:15:59.925 --> 00:16:01.226
ENTITIES COMING FOR WITH DEALS

00:16:01.293 --> 00:16:03.929
THAT WE HADN'T CONSIDERED

00:16:03.996 --> 00:16:07.366
BEFORE YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE. I

00:16:07.433 --> 00:16:07.933
WAS WHICH COUNTY IT WAS BUT

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:08.801
THERE WAS ONE COUNTY WHO. WE

00:16:08.867 --> 00:16:09.935
HAD ACTUALLY EXCLUDED A SITE IN

00:16:10.002 --> 00:16:11.637
OUR INITIAL INVENTORY IT WAS IN

00:16:11.704 --> 00:16:13.806
ITSELF COMPLETELY NOT

00:16:13.872 --> 00:16:14.406
APPROPRIATE FOR HOUSING IT WAS

00:16:14.473 --> 00:16:16.475
WAY OUT IN THE WOODS. BUT THEY

00:16:16.542 --> 00:16:17.409
WANTED TO USE IT FOR AN

00:16:17.476 --> 00:16:18.444
ALTERNATE PURPOSE AND THEY'RE

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:19.345
WILLING TO DO A LAND SWAP

00:16:19.411 --> 00:16:21.313
BETWEEN THAT PROPERTY AND A

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:22.448
DECENT SURVEY CREATURES THAT

00:16:22.514 --> 00:16:24.683
WAS RESIDENTIALLY LOCATED. AND

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:25.250
SO YOU KNOW THOSE SORTS OF

00:16:25.317 --> 00:16:28.220
DEALS AND THINGS ARE GONNA MAKE

00:16:28.287 --> 00:16:29.388
THIS NUMBER FLUCTUATES

00:16:29.455 --> 00:16:30.489
ESPECIALLY IF WE PUBLISH THE

00:16:30.556 --> 00:16:32.057
MAP. BUT IT'S GOT KIND OF WORK

00:16:32.124 --> 00:16:36.328
SITTING AT PRESENT THIS MAP IS

00:16:36.395 --> 00:16:37.996
NAPA COUNTY AND IT GIVES YOU A

00:16:38.063 --> 00:16:39.331
SENSE FOR ALL OF THE PROPERTY

00:16:39.398 --> 00:16:40.699
TO THE STATE OWNED IN THE

00:16:40.766 --> 00:16:42.401
COUNTY. YOU'LL NOTICE SOME

00:16:42.468 --> 00:16:44.269
PARTICULAR CLUSTERING YOU ALSO

00:16:44.336 --> 00:16:46.372
NOTICE YOU KNOW JUST SORT OF

00:16:46.438 --> 00:16:49.675
THOSE WITH NO THE COUNTY HOW.

00:16:49.742 --> 00:16:51.043
IF THE RESERVES ARE PRETTY

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.977
RURAL AREAS IN SOME CASES THESE

00:16:52.044 --> 00:16:54.346
ARE MORE URBAN THIS IS THIS IS

00:16:54.413 --> 00:16:55.814
A SNAPSHOT CAM WE WENT THROUGH

00:16:55.881 --> 00:16:57.249
WE WERE DEVELOPING THE THIS

00:16:57.316 --> 00:16:59.818
INVENTORY. THIS NEXT SLIDE IS

00:16:59.885 --> 00:17:01.820
AN EXAMPLE OF A SITE THAT IS

00:17:01.887 --> 00:17:04.456
GOING TO BE ON THE US LIST AND

00:17:04.523 --> 00:17:05.824
WE WOULD SEE ESPECIALLY BIBLE

00:17:05.891 --> 00:17:07.526
FOR DEVELOPMENT. YOU'LL NOTICE

00:17:07.593 --> 00:17:09.962
IT'S ACTUALLY THE PARK AREA TO

00:17:10.028 --> 00:17:11.196
THE NORTH IS THE CAPITAL SO IT

00:17:11.263 --> 00:17:13.132
IS JUST TO THE SOUTH A COUPLE

00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:18.637
HERE. HERE IN SACRAMENTO IT'S A

00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:22.875
DTS OWN SITE ACTUALLY. TRY TO

00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:23.475
BE POTENTIALLY GO FORWARD AS A

00:17:23.542 --> 00:17:24.042
DEVELOPMENT. BUT IT'S NOT A

00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:26.078
BIG. FORTY ACRE SITE IN THE

00:17:26.145 --> 00:17:26.678
MIDDLE OF AN URBAN AREA IT'S

00:17:26.745 --> 00:17:27.579
SMALLER SITE. THE EXECUTIVE

00:17:27.646 --> 00:17:28.414
ORDER DOES CALL OUT BIG

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.082
DEVELOPMENTS IN A CALLS OUT

00:17:30.149 --> 00:17:31.583
SMALL DEVELOPMENTS THIS MIGHT

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:34.686
BE A FORTY MICRO UNIT SITES.

00:17:34.753 --> 00:17:35.888
THAT COULD BE A DIVERSE AND

00:17:35.954 --> 00:17:37.823
AFFORDABLE WERE LOOKING AT

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:38.857
EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN AND

00:17:38.924 --> 00:17:41.193
NOT. PUTTING OURSELVES JUST TO

SURE YOU WANT TO KNOW KIND OF

00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:48.333
HOW WE SCREEN THE SITES AND FOR

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:48.934
THAT SUCH AS GOING TO KIND OF

00:17:49.001 --> 00:17:51.770
WALK ADDRESS. IT MORNING YES.

DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF REAL ESTATE

00:17:58.277 --> 00:17:59.912

00:18:12.458 --> 00:18:14.359
MORNING SAYS JASON DESCRIBED

00:18:14.426 --> 00:18:15.427
IT'S BEEN A PRETTY RAPID

00:18:15.494 --> 00:18:16.662
PROCESS SINCE THE GOVERNOR

00:18:16.728 --> 00:18:18.897
SIGNED THE EXECUTIVE ORDER AND

00:18:18.964 --> 00:18:19.898
AS WE DEVELOP SCREENING

00:18:19.965 --> 00:18:21.700
CRITERIA DECENT ALLUDED TO THIS

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:22.968
BUT WE WERE BOTH TRYING TO

00:18:23.035 --> 00:18:23.902
FIGURE OUT WHERE HOUSING IS

00:18:23.969 --> 00:18:25.471
MOST NEEDED. AND WORST

00:18:25.537 --> 00:18:27.539
PARTICULAR SITES MIGHT BE MORE

00:18:27.606 --> 00:18:28.907
ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE THAN

00:18:28.974 --> 00:18:30.509
OTHERS AGAIN EMPHASIZING WHAT

00:18:30.576 --> 00:18:32.411
JASON SAID WE WEREN'T SAYING NO

00:18:32.478 --> 00:18:33.545
TO SITES BUT JUST TRYING TO

00:18:33.612 --> 00:18:35.881
IDENTIFY WHAT OUR PRIORITIES

00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:37.149
MIGHT BE GIVEN THESE FACTORS SO

00:18:37.216 --> 00:18:42.754
IN THIS VITAL TALK THROUGH.

00:18:42.821 --> 00:18:43.355
BOTH THE HOUSING NEED CRITERIA

00:18:43.422 --> 00:18:46.492
AND THE ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY.

00:18:46.558 --> 00:18:47.159
SO WE THREE MEASURES TO

00:18:47.226 --> 00:18:48.160
IDENTIFY WHERE HOUSING IS MOST

00:18:48.227 --> 00:18:48.660
NEEDED AND IMPACTFUL AND

00:18:48.727 --> 00:18:49.261
ACTUALLY RIFFS ON SOME OF THE

00:18:49.328 --> 00:18:50.095
THINGS THAT SENATOR DODD

00:18:50.162 --> 00:18:52.064
MENTIONED AT THE START IN THE

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:53.732
INTRODUCTION. SO ALL COVER

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:55.334
THOSE NOW. THE FIRST THE

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.268
AVAILABILITY OF AFFORDABLE

00:18:56.335 --> 00:18:58.103
HOUSING. AND THAT'S ADDRESSING

00:18:58.170 --> 00:18:59.571
THE AVAILABILITY OF AFFORDABLE

00:18:59.638 --> 00:19:00.973
HOUSING IN THE JOB AND

00:19:01.039 --> 00:19:02.274
COMMUTERS SHEDS TO REALLY

00:19:02.341 --> 00:19:04.743
TRYING TO ADDRESS THOSE

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:05.377
HOUSEHOLDS THAT MAY NOT BE ABLE

00:19:05.444 --> 00:19:07.513
TO FIND. HOMES THAT ARE CLOSE

00:19:07.579 --> 00:19:09.214
TO WHERE THEY'RE WORKING. TO

00:19:09.281 --> 00:19:10.215
MEASURE THAT WE LOOK AT WHERE

00:19:10.282 --> 00:19:12.384
THE SHORTFALL IN UNITS THAT ARE

00:19:12.451 --> 00:19:13.018
RENTED AT A LEVEL AFFORDABLE TO

00:19:13.085 --> 00:19:16.688
VERY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. ART

00:19:16.755 --> 00:19:18.290
IS GREATER THAN 30% OF THE

00:19:18.357 --> 00:19:20.425
NUMBER OF FEEL I HOUSE OF

00:19:20.492 --> 00:19:21.627
NUMBER OF VERY LOW INCOME

00:19:21.693 --> 00:19:23.428
HOUSEHOLDS EXCUSE ME. TO REALLY

00:19:23.495 --> 00:19:24.363
TRYING TO LOOK AT WHERE THERE'S

00:19:24.429 --> 00:19:27.032
A GAP BETWEEN AVAILABLE HOUSING

00:19:27.099 --> 00:19:28.433
FOR FOLKS THAT REALLY NEED IT.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.569
WHO ARE WORKING UBER HOODS AND

00:19:30.636 --> 00:19:32.971
WHERE DOES NOT EXIST. THAT

00:19:33.038 --> 00:19:33.906
MEASURE ALONG WITH EVERYTHING

00:19:33.972 --> 00:19:36.041
ELSE IS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA

00:19:36.108 --> 00:19:36.575
SO WE'RE NOT TRYING TO USE

00:19:36.642 --> 00:19:39.511
PROPRIETARY DATA HERE. WE ALSO

00:19:39.578 --> 00:19:40.812
LOOK AT THE GAP BETWEEN SUPPLY

00:19:40.879 --> 00:19:42.080
AND DEMAND AND SPECIFICALLY

00:19:42.147 --> 00:19:43.248
WHERE THE GAP BETWEEN THE

00:19:43.315 --> 00:19:44.316
REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS

00:19:44.383 --> 00:19:46.084
ASSESSMENT OR THE RINA. AND

00:19:46.151 --> 00:19:47.653
BUILDING PERMITS ISSUED WHERE

00:19:47.719 --> 00:19:49.454
THAT GAP IS GREATER THAN

00:19:49.521 --> 00:19:50.155
FIFTEEN HUNDRED PERMITS SO

00:19:50.222 --> 00:19:51.390
WHERE THE JURISDICTION IS NOT

00:19:51.456 --> 00:19:52.024
PRODUCING. UP TO THEIR PLANNING

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:54.726
GOALS. AND THIRD WE ALSO LOOK

00:19:54.793 --> 00:19:55.594
AT THE RATE OF INCREASE AND

00:19:55.661 --> 00:19:57.329
RENTS. SPECIFICALLY WHERE THE

00:19:57.396 --> 00:19:58.830
MEDIAN GROSS RENT INCREASED BY

00:19:58.897 --> 00:20:01.400
MORE THAN 5% IN A YEAR OVER

00:20:01.466 --> 00:20:03.602
YEAR BASIS SO RULING LOOKING AT

00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:06.305
WHERE THERE'S- ACTIVE PRESSURE.

00:20:06.371 --> 00:20:07.739
IN THE RENTAL MARKET AND

00:20:07.806 --> 00:20:12.110
AFFORDABILITY IS DIMINISHING.

00:20:12.177 --> 00:20:14.913
TO LOOK AT SPECIFIC SITES WE-

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:16.481
ALSO EXAMINE ECONOMIC

00:20:16.548 --> 00:20:18.317
FEASIBILITY MEASURES AND HERE

00:20:18.383 --> 00:20:20.152
WE USE SEVERAL MEASURES TO

00:20:20.218 --> 00:20:20.686
EVALUATED DEFERRED AT THE

00:20:20.752 --> 00:20:21.253
DEVELOPMENT PROJECT WOULD BE

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.156
FEASIBLE. AND NAMELY WE BUILD

00:20:24.222 --> 00:20:26.191
ON THAT TGS ANALYSIS THAT

00:20:26.258 --> 00:20:27.726
DECENT DESCRIBED AT THE START

00:20:27.793 --> 00:20:29.828
SO BEFORE WE EVEN GET TO

00:20:29.895 --> 00:20:31.530
THINKING ABOUT WHAT TYPES OF

00:20:31.597 --> 00:20:32.798
ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY THERE MAY

00:20:32.864 --> 00:20:34.733
BE IF A SITE IS GRADED

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.101
VERTICALLY WE KNOW IT WILL BE

00:20:36.168 --> 00:20:37.402
VERY EXPENSIVE IF NOT IT

00:20:37.469 --> 00:20:39.271
IMPOSSIBLE TO DEVELOP THEIR SO

00:20:39.338 --> 00:20:40.672
IN THAT WAY OUR ECONOMIC

00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:43.075
FEASIBILITY MODEL REALLY BUILT

00:20:43.141 --> 00:20:43.575
OFF OF THE ANALYSIS THAT

00:20:43.642 --> 00:20:46.078
JASON'S TEAM LEAD. FURTHER WE

00:20:46.144 --> 00:20:47.546
LOOK AT PROXIMITY TO JOB

00:20:47.613 --> 00:20:49.281
CENTERS THREE LOOKING AT CENSUS

00:20:49.348 --> 00:20:52.184
TRACKS WHERE THE NUMBER OF JOBS

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:52.951
THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE

00:20:53.018 --> 00:20:55.587
WITH LESS THAN A BE A- BOMB AND

00:20:55.654 --> 00:20:56.822
THAT FALL WITHIN A GIVEN

00:20:56.888 --> 00:20:59.825
RADIUS. ARE NOT REALLY MEETING

00:20:59.891 --> 00:21:01.393
THE NEEDS OF THOSE FOLKS THAT

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:02.828
ARE WORKING THERE. TO DO THIS

00:21:02.894 --> 00:21:04.529
WE USE THAT EACH CITY ANTI CáC

00:21:04.596 --> 00:21:06.164
OPPORTUNITY MAPS AND WE'RE

00:21:06.231 --> 00:21:06.632
LOOKING AT THE TOP TWO

00:21:06.698 --> 00:21:09.735
QUINTILES. WE ALSO LOOK AT

00:21:09.801 --> 00:21:11.737
PROXIMITY THE EDUCATION. AGAIN

00:21:11.803 --> 00:21:13.038
MENTIONING SOME OF THE FACTORS

00:21:13.105 --> 00:21:14.906
THAT YOU DESCRIBED. WE LOOK AT

00:21:14.973 --> 00:21:16.375
CENSUS TRACKS FOR THE EDUCATION

00:21:16.441 --> 00:21:17.876
COMPOSITE INDICATOR IS WITHIN

00:21:17.943 --> 00:21:19.678
THE TOP TWO QUINTILES STATEWIDE

00:21:19.745 --> 00:21:21.413
SO MAKING SURE THAT IF. THESE

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.781
SITES ARE IN AREAS OF

00:21:22.848 --> 00:21:24.750
OPPORTUNITY THERE'S ALSO GOING

00:21:24.816 --> 00:21:26.985
TO BE HI OPPORTUNITY EDUCATION

00:21:27.052 --> 00:21:29.254
I'M THERE FOR THE HOUSEHOLDS.

00:21:29.321 --> 00:21:30.155
WE ALSO LOOK AT PROXIMITY TO

00:21:30.222 --> 00:21:32.057
HIGH FREQUENCY PUBLIC TRANSIT.

00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:33.959
AND ANY AREA WITHIN THE STATE

00:21:34.026 --> 00:21:35.761
THAT IS WITHIN HALF A MILE OF

00:21:35.827 --> 00:21:37.162
HIGH FREQUENCY PUBLIC TRANSIT

00:21:37.229 --> 00:21:39.731
STOPS. SO WITH THOSE FACTORS WE

00:21:39.798 --> 00:21:41.466
CAN THEN START TO MEASURE HOW

00:21:41.533 --> 00:21:42.300
EACH ONE OF THE SITES ARE

00:21:42.367 --> 00:21:44.870
STACKING UP. AND A SITE MAY BE

00:21:44.936 --> 00:21:46.405
IN AN AREA WITH HIGH HOUSING

00:21:46.471 --> 00:21:48.674
NEED OR MODERATE HOUSING NEED.

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:50.175
AT A PARTICULAR SITE MAY BE

00:21:50.242 --> 00:21:51.710
HITTING ON EACH ONE OF THOSE

00:21:51.777 --> 00:21:52.911
THREE ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY

00:21:52.978 --> 00:21:55.180
FACTORSWERE NINE. AGAIN NOT TO

00:21:55.247 --> 00:21:56.548
BE SCRIPT PRESCRIPTIVE BUT JUST

00:21:56.615 --> 00:21:58.116
TO SHOW THAT THESE SITES IF

00:21:58.183 --> 00:21:58.817
THEY'RE MEETING ON THOSE

00:21:58.884 --> 00:22:00.452
ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY FACTORS.

00:22:00.519 --> 00:22:01.953
THEY MAY BE MORE COMPETITIVE

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.456
FOR TAX CREDITS AND OTHER A

00:22:04.523 --> 00:22:05.090
FIND AFFORDABLE HOUSING FINANCE

00:22:05.157 --> 00:22:10.062
THAT'S AVAILABLE. AWESOME TWO

00:22:10.128 --> 00:22:10.629
IN TERMS OF THE DEVELOPMENT

00:22:10.696 --> 00:22:14.766
APPROACH. THE FIRST BILL POINT

00:22:14.833 --> 00:22:16.401
STATE DEVELOPMENTS BUT I THINK

00:22:16.468 --> 00:22:17.002
IT'S A GOOD TIME TO KIND OF

00:22:17.069 --> 00:22:19.905
HIGHLIGHT THE WAY THIS IS BEING

00:22:19.971 --> 00:22:20.739
APPROACH TYPICALLY WITH THE

00:22:20.806 --> 00:22:23.842
LOCALS AT THE END THE DAY WE

00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:25.143
FOUND THE TICKET MORE TAXES

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:27.345
WITH COMING UP WITH IN TOURING

00:22:27.412 --> 00:22:29.781
THAT INVENTORY IS DONE IT'LL BE

00:22:29.848 --> 00:22:31.416
PUBLISHED AND WHAT THAT REALLY

00:22:31.483 --> 00:22:32.718
SHOWS IS THESE ARE THE SITES

00:22:32.784 --> 00:22:35.721
THE STATUS SAID. WE COULD SEE

00:22:35.787 --> 00:22:38.557
DEVELOP AS HOUSING IT DOESN'T

00:22:38.623 --> 00:22:39.124
NECESSARILY MEAN THAT EVERY

00:22:39.191 --> 00:22:40.192
SINGLE ON THE SITES ARE YOU

00:22:40.258 --> 00:22:43.028
KNOW THE BILL POLL IT MAY BE

00:22:43.095 --> 00:22:45.063
THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:47.766
LOCAL CONCERNS IT MAY BE THAT

00:22:47.833 --> 00:22:49.634
THERE ARE THINGS THAT MAKE THEM

00:22:49.701 --> 00:22:51.603
MORE OR LESS DIFFICULT TO

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:53.371
DEVELOPE THAT WE'RE NOT AWARE

00:22:53.438 --> 00:22:55.407
OF STILL THE LOCAL LEVEL IT MAY

00:22:55.474 --> 00:22:59.611
BE THAT ALL THE SITES ARE GOOD

00:22:59.678 --> 00:23:00.212
BUT THERE ARE SOME SITES THAT

00:23:00.278 --> 00:23:03.148
ARE BETTER OR WORSE THAN OTHERS.

00:23:03.215 --> 00:23:05.217
THE NUMBER OF PLACES WHERE I

00:23:05.283 --> 00:23:10.989
THINK. NICE THAT OUR LIST AS A

00:23:11.056 --> 00:23:11.690
GOES OUT IS REALLY SORT OF

00:23:11.757 --> 00:23:13.391
STATE INVENTORY PROPERTY AND

00:23:13.458 --> 00:23:15.861
THEN THE NEXT SET OF THIS

00:23:15.927 --> 00:23:16.762
REALLY BIG IS WORKING LOCAL

00:23:16.828 --> 00:23:20.098
GOVERNMENTS TO IDENTIFY WHERE

00:23:20.165 --> 00:23:21.233
WE SHOULD BE PRIORITIZING

00:23:21.299 --> 00:23:22.601
DEVELOPMENTS OBVIOUSLY WORKED

00:23:22.667 --> 00:23:23.168
BECAUSE THE COMMITTED LINE

00:23:23.235 --> 00:23:23.835
THERE'S GONNA BE SOME

00:23:23.902 --> 00:23:25.904
PRIVATIZATION IS HAPPENING

00:23:25.971 --> 00:23:27.739
EARLY ON AND WHERE WE ARE WE

00:23:27.806 --> 00:23:29.741
ARE WORKING WITH LOCALS ON THAT

00:23:29.808 --> 00:23:31.676
BUT ONCE NOT GOES PUBLIC I

00:23:31.743 --> 00:23:34.112
THINK THAT'S WHEN WE EXPECT THE

00:23:34.179 --> 00:23:35.313
MORE VOLUMINOUS CONVERSATIONS

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:42.053
TO HAPPEN ABOUT PARTICULAR.

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:42.621
SITES PARTICULAR LIABILITIES

00:23:42.687 --> 00:23:46.625
PARTICULAR USES. SO FAR

00:23:46.691 --> 00:23:47.793
THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS THERE

00:23:47.859 --> 00:23:48.693
HAVE BEEN QUITE A FEW LOCAL

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:49.795
ENTITIES CITY AND COUNTY LEVEL.

00:23:49.861 --> 00:23:50.428
AS WELL AS PROFESSIONAL

00:23:50.495 --> 00:23:51.596
ORGANIZATIONS WHO REACHED OUT

00:23:51.663 --> 00:23:52.164
SOME OF COME THROUGH MEMBERS

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:52.964
SOME OF COME THROUGH THE

00:23:53.031 --> 00:23:53.532
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE SOME COME

00:23:53.598 --> 00:23:54.166
THROUGH CONSULTANT SOME OF COME

00:23:54.232 --> 00:23:55.534
TO US DIRECTLY. AND WE'VE WE'VE

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:56.468
HAD THE SAME MESSAGE TO ALL OF

00:23:56.535 --> 00:23:58.804
THEM ALL THE MAP IS COMING IF

00:23:58.870 --> 00:23:59.871
YOU'VE GOT SITES HERE WHERE OF

00:23:59.938 --> 00:24:02.374
PLEASE LET US KNOW. AS ENTITIES

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.475
HAVE PROPOSED SITES WITH

00:24:03.542 --> 00:24:05.977
ACTUALLY EVEN IF WE'VE SCREEN

00:24:06.044 --> 00:24:06.945
THEM OUT WE ADDED THEM TO LIST

00:24:07.012 --> 00:24:07.879
AND WENT TO THE APARTMENTS

00:24:07.946 --> 00:24:14.853
INVENTED OUR GOAL. STATE AND WE

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.321
FIND THAT THE LOCAL INPUT THAT

00:24:16.388 --> 00:24:17.989
PROCESS IS GOING TO BE

00:24:18.056 --> 00:24:19.491
INVALUABLE. AT THE SAME POINT

00:24:19.558 --> 00:24:20.292
TIME EVEN THOUGH THE OUR STATE

00:24:20.358 --> 00:24:22.260
DEVELOPMENTS THERE STILL AN

00:24:22.327 --> 00:24:23.595
ABSOLUTE LOCAL CONNECTIVITY

00:24:23.662 --> 00:24:24.996
THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN YOU AT A

00:24:25.063 --> 00:24:28.066
MINIMUM WATER SEWER GAS THINGS-LIKE THAT AND SO. YOU KNOW THE

00:24:28.133 --> 00:24:29.367
PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL

00:24:29.434 --> 00:24:31.203
GOVERNMENTS CAN BE CRITICAL WE

00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:32.904
ALSO AGREED RECOGNIZE THAT WE

00:24:32.971 --> 00:24:36.374
ARE IN A DEARTH OF LOCAL

00:24:36.441 --> 00:24:37.209
INFORMATION KEEPING WITH LOCAL

00:24:37.275 --> 00:24:39.311
AGAIN HOPEFULLY. STOCK TO

00:24:39.377 --> 00:24:41.012
REPETITIVE BUT WE RECOGNIZE

00:24:41.079 --> 00:24:42.147
THAT WE DON'T KNOW NECESSARILY

00:24:42.214 --> 00:24:44.216
THAT TINA TWO BLOCKS DOWN THE

00:24:44.282 --> 00:24:45.217
STREET THERE WAS A DEVELOPMENT

00:24:45.283 --> 00:24:46.952
THAT WAS PLAN PROPOSED IN IT.

00:24:47.018 --> 00:24:48.386
IT FIT DIETER FAILED FOR

00:24:48.453 --> 00:24:49.454
REASONS ACT WIRES THE THOSE

00:24:49.521 --> 00:24:50.989
LESSONS LEARNED HOW TO AVOID

00:24:51.056 --> 00:24:52.424
THOSE ISSUES WEEK WE RECOGNIZE

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:53.892
WE DON'T KNOW THAT AND- YOU

00:24:53.959 --> 00:24:54.626
KNOW PICK UP PICK A RANDOM

00:24:54.693 --> 00:24:56.561
STREET AND ANY PICKLER YOU KNOW

00:24:56.628 --> 00:24:58.463
JURISDICTION IN THE STATE SO. I

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:00.098
THINK THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND

00:25:00.165 --> 00:25:02.100
THOSE LESSONS LEARNED ARE GOING

00:25:02.167 --> 00:25:03.668
TO BE ABSOLUTELY INVALUABLE AND

00:25:03.735 --> 00:25:05.070
WE- EXECUTIVE ORDER HIGHLIGHTS

00:25:05.136 --> 00:25:07.205
AND WE ARE EXPECTING TO. HAVE A

00:25:07.272 --> 00:25:11.743
ROBUST. PARTNERSHIP LOCAL

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:12.344
GOVERNMENTS YOU KNOW ONCE THE

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:16.047
ONCE THE MAP GOES OUT. THAT

00:25:16.114 --> 00:25:18.049
SAID THE APPROACH IN THE

00:25:18.116 --> 00:25:19.317
EXECUTIVE ORDERS PRETTY SIMPLE

00:25:19.384 --> 00:25:20.085
YOU KNOW ASIDE FROM LEVERAGING

00:25:20.151 --> 00:25:21.953
EXISTING SURPLUS PROPERTY.

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:22.954
WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT IN LAST

00:25:23.021 --> 00:25:25.090
LIED WE WILL BE FOCUSING ON

00:25:25.156 --> 00:25:26.658
LONG TERM GROUND LEASES. WE

00:25:26.725 --> 00:25:27.659
HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ENTER

00:25:27.726 --> 00:25:29.561
INTO LEASES UP TO UP QUITE A

00:25:29.628 --> 00:25:30.929
LONG TERM WE CAN GO NINE NINE

00:25:30.996 --> 00:25:31.830
YEARS HE WANTED TO. WAIVERS CAN

00:25:31.897 --> 00:25:32.931
BE BEST ALTERNATELY FOR THAT

00:25:32.998 --> 00:25:35.200
DEVELOPMENT AND BY ABILITY WE

00:25:35.267 --> 00:25:35.934
CAN LEVERAGE STATE PROPERTY

00:25:36.001 --> 00:25:37.969
VALUES WE DO NOT HAVE TO LISA

00:25:38.036 --> 00:25:38.837
FOR MARKET VALUE FOR THE

00:25:38.904 --> 00:25:40.405
PROPERTY ITSELF. IN THAT WAY WE

00:25:40.472 --> 00:25:43.174
CAN WE CONTRIVE THE- POTENTIAL

00:25:43.241 --> 00:25:45.377
FOR DEVELOPMENT. PLEASE GIVE

00:25:45.443 --> 00:25:46.578
ORDER DOES CALL OUT IN A BIT OF

00:25:46.645 --> 00:25:47.846
CONSTRUCTION SO AGAIN THESE ARE

00:25:47.913 --> 00:25:49.648
NOT YOUR TYPICAL DEVELOPMENTS

00:25:49.714 --> 00:25:50.548
WITH A DIESEL HAVE TO BE. WELL

00:25:50.615 --> 00:25:52.117
THAT'S MASS TIMBER MODULAR

00:25:52.183 --> 00:25:53.351
UNITS PREFABRICATION MICRO

00:25:53.418 --> 00:25:56.388
UNITS WE'RE LOOKING AT AS MANY

00:25:56.454 --> 00:25:57.188
INNOVATIVE WAYS TO BUILD

00:25:57.255 --> 00:25:59.357
HOUSING AS POSSIBLE. THERE'S

00:25:59.424 --> 00:26:01.126
ALSO HIGHLIGHTS EXECUTIVE ORDER

00:26:01.192 --> 00:26:02.594
BY DOING THIS IN A VERY

00:26:02.661 --> 00:26:03.461
SUSTAINABLE WAY AND COST

00:26:03.528 --> 00:26:05.430
EFFECTIVELY SUSTAINABLE WAY.

00:26:05.497 --> 00:26:06.364
AND THEN DOING IT IN AN

00:26:06.431 --> 00:26:07.399
EQUITABLE WAY WHETHER THAT'S

00:26:07.465 --> 00:26:09.200
FAILING WAGE OR ARE FOCUSING ON

00:26:09.267 --> 00:26:11.202
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AS WELL.

00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:13.738
AND THEN FINALLY I THINK A

00:26:13.805 --> 00:26:14.673
COUPLE OTHER HIGHLIGHTS THAT

00:26:14.739 --> 00:26:16.007
WITH MENTIONING. THE SECOND

00:26:16.074 --> 00:26:18.176
ORDER ALSO DOES CALL OUT LAND

00:26:18.243 --> 00:26:19.444
SWAPS I MENTION ONE EXAMPLE

00:26:19.511 --> 00:26:28.954
EARLIER. AND THERE'S LIMITED.

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:29.554
EXISTING AUTHORITY TO THAT BUT

00:26:29.621 --> 00:26:30.088
WHERE POSSIBLE WE'RE ALSO

00:26:30.155 --> 00:26:34.926
LOOKING AT. ROLE OF MAYBE OUR

00:26:34.993 --> 00:26:36.194
SITE IS IN GREAT FOR HOUSING.

00:26:36.261 --> 00:26:38.296
BE GREAT FOR SOME ALTERNATE USE

00:26:38.363 --> 00:26:41.066
IF THE CITY OR COUNTY HAD A- SO

00:26:41.132 --> 00:26:42.133
WE COULD SWAP AND ONE GOES

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:42.834
HOUSING ONE GOES WHERE THEY

00:26:42.901 --> 00:26:44.002
ALTERNATE USES WERE OPEN TO

00:26:44.069 --> 00:26:44.602
THOSE TYPES OF ARRANGEMENTS AS

00:26:44.669 --> 00:26:45.437
WELL. WERE ALSO OPEN TO CO

00:26:45.503 --> 00:26:46.137
DEVELOPMENTS ONE PARTICULAR

00:26:46.204 --> 00:26:47.105
CITY REACHED OUT DURING THE

00:26:47.172 --> 00:26:48.139
PROCESS THERE WAS A PARTIAL

00:26:48.206 --> 00:26:48.673
THAT WE HAD THAT WAS VERY

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:49.574
IRREGULAR SHAPED IT REALLY

00:26:49.641 --> 00:26:51.276
WOULD NOT HAVE WORKED FOR

00:26:51.343 --> 00:26:52.711
HOUSING HOWEVER THEY OWN THE

00:26:52.777 --> 00:26:53.945
TWO ADJACENT PARCELS AND AS A

00:26:54.012 --> 00:26:54.579
CODE DEVELOPMENT IT'S- ACTUALLY

00:26:54.646 --> 00:26:56.114
VERY VERY VIABLE. AND SO

00:26:56.181 --> 00:26:57.349
LOOKING AT THOSE CONVERSATIONS

00:26:57.415 --> 00:26:58.083
WITH A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS

00:26:58.149 --> 00:27:01.119
WELL WE'VE BEEN VERY PLEASED TO

00:27:01.186 --> 00:27:01.586
KIND OF SEE SOME VERY

00:27:01.653 --> 00:27:04.522
INNOVATIVE IDEAS. SECOND TO

00:27:04.589 --> 00:27:05.991
LAST EXISTING SURPLUS SO ONE OF

00:27:06.057 --> 00:27:08.393
THE CHALLENGES HISTORICALLY

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:09.828
WITH US A PROPERTY IS. AFTER

00:27:09.894 --> 00:27:12.230
DECLARE SURPLUS IN SOME CASES

00:27:12.297 --> 00:27:14.299
PROPERTY SETS. IT'S FOR NUMBER

00:27:14.366 --> 00:27:17.102
OF REASONS. BUT IN SOME CASES

00:27:17.168 --> 00:27:19.571
IT'S BECAUSE OF POTENTIAL STATE

00:27:19.637 --> 00:27:23.141
WE USE AND. BALLOTS THAT'S A

00:27:23.208 --> 00:27:25.944
BIG REASON WHY AND SO THE

00:27:26.011 --> 00:27:26.511
EXECUTIVE ORDER THE VETTING

00:27:26.578 --> 00:27:27.645
PROCESS THERE WERE QUITE A FEW

00:27:27.712 --> 00:27:28.580
DEPARTMENTS WOULD PROPERTIES

00:27:28.646 --> 00:27:29.881
WHO HAD BEEN YOU KNOW

00:27:29.948 --> 00:27:31.249
VACILLATING ON POTENTIALLY

00:27:31.316 --> 00:27:32.550
REDUCE THEIR PROPERTY THE

00:27:32.617 --> 00:27:33.785
FUTUREWHO SAID NO WE'RE FINE

00:27:33.852 --> 00:27:34.953
WITH ALTERNATELY DIVESTING OF

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:36.654
THIS AND SO THERE ARE SOME

00:27:36.721 --> 00:27:37.555
SIGNIFICANT SURPLUS PROPERTIES

00:27:37.622 --> 00:27:38.990
ACROSS THE STATE THAT HAVE

00:27:39.057 --> 00:27:40.291
BEEN. SHAKEN LOOSE AS WELL

00:27:40.358 --> 00:27:42.394
THROUGHOUT THIS AND I THINK THE

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:43.495
LAST POINT IS THE OTHERS

00:27:43.561 --> 00:27:44.229
THERE'S A MENTION EXECUTIVE

00:27:44.295 --> 00:27:45.930
ORDER ON YOU'RE PRIORITIZING

00:27:45.997 --> 00:27:48.133
FUNDING AS WELL FOR THE EFFORT

00:27:48.199 --> 00:27:51.269
SO I THINK ALL OF OUR- YOU KNOW

00:27:51.336 --> 00:27:52.070
THE IF THE AUTHORITIES ARE

00:27:52.137 --> 00:27:53.972
THERE THE WILLINGNESS IS THERE

00:27:54.039 --> 00:27:55.173
AT THE DEPARTMENTS HAVE BEEN

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:57.142
GREAT AND GIVING UP. PROPERTIES

00:27:57.208 --> 00:27:59.711
THAT THEY DO NOT NEED ANYMORE

00:27:59.778 --> 00:28:00.712
SO FAR ARE ENGAGING WITH THE

00:28:00.779 --> 00:28:01.579
LOCALS HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN

00:28:01.646 --> 00:28:03.014
REALLY ENCOURAGING AND

00:28:03.081 --> 00:28:08.453
REFRESHING AND WERE ABOUT THAT.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:09.054
STAGE WILL PUBLISH THE MAP AND

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:13.024
BEGIN THE ACTUAL ART PIECE. SO

00:28:13.091 --> 00:28:13.625
THAT WAS A LOT I KNOW SHE GOT

00:28:13.691 --> 00:28:15.093
QUESTIONS. AND THEN WE CAN

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:19.497
ANSWER FOR YOU GUYS. PROCEED TO

00:28:19.564 --> 00:28:20.465

APOLOGIZE MISTER KING I WAS IN

00:28:23.768 --> 00:28:24.469
AND OUT DURING YOUR

00:28:24.536 --> 00:28:25.303
PRESENTATION BUT DID YOU SAY AT

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:26.404
WHAT POINT WOULD YOU HAVE ALL

00:28:26.471 --> 00:28:27.739
THE SITES IDENTIFIED IN THE MAP

00:28:27.806 --> 00:28:29.774
FINALIZED THE HEAT MAP RELEASE

00:28:29.841 --> 00:28:31.976
WE HAD SAID A FEW MONTHS BACK

00:28:32.043 --> 00:28:35.680
COULD BE THE SUMMER OF TWENTY

00:28:35.747 --> 00:28:36.247
NINETEEN. SO WE EXPECTED BE

00:28:36.314 --> 00:28:38.183
FAIRLY IMMINENT OKAY. SENATE

00:28:38.249 --> 00:28:40.318
NIELSEN AND IS THERE A FOCUSED

00:28:40.385 --> 00:28:43.822
ON. HOUSING TO BE AVAILABLE

00:28:43.888 --> 00:28:46.124
THEN FOR THE HOMELESS OR THIS

00:28:46.191 --> 00:28:47.859
JUST IN GENERAL HOUSING PERIOD

00:28:47.926 --> 00:28:50.328
FOR ANYBODY WE ARE LOOKING AT

00:28:50.395 --> 00:28:53.531
HOUSING MORE IN GENERAL AT ALL

00:28:53.598 --> 00:28:55.900
RANGES FROM VERY LOW

00:28:55.967 --> 00:28:56.701
AFFORDABILITY ALL WITH THE WORK

00:28:56.768 --> 00:28:59.204
FORCE IT'S IT REALLY WILL

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:00.438
DEPEND ON THE AREA AND THE

00:29:00.505 --> 00:29:03.041
SITES AND WHAT THE BIBLE BUT-

00:29:03.108 --> 00:29:03.675
WE'RE NOT. NECESSARILY SHUTTING

00:29:03.741 --> 00:29:06.211
OFF ANY THE DOORS. HOW ABOUT IN

00:29:06.277 --> 00:29:07.946
HIGH COST COUNTIES LIKE MARIN

00:29:08.012 --> 00:29:11.850
FOR EXAMPLE. WHAT CAN WE DO IN

00:29:11.916 --> 00:29:14.018
A COUNTY THAT HIGH COST SO

00:29:14.085 --> 00:29:14.786
LET'S THAT GOES BACK TO

00:29:14.853 --> 00:29:15.420
LEVERAGING STATE PROPERTY

00:29:15.487 --> 00:29:17.088
VALUES YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT WE'VE

00:29:17.155 --> 00:29:18.823
GOT PROPERTY IN SOME AREAS THAT

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:20.525
SELLS FOR THREE MILLION DOLLARS

00:29:20.592 --> 00:29:23.628
AN ACRE AND SO BEING ABLE TO

00:29:23.695 --> 00:29:25.763
LEVERAGE A LONG TERM LEASE

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:27.665
MAYBE FIFTY YEARS FOR A DOLLAR

00:29:27.732 --> 00:29:29.134
AND BEING ABLE TO DRIVE DOWN

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:29.968
THE COST FOR CONSTRUCTION THERE

00:29:30.034 --> 00:29:32.871
IS A HUGE WIN WE CAN CONTRIBUTE

00:29:32.937 --> 00:29:35.406
TO THE AFFORDABLE. DEVELOPMENT.

00:29:35.473 --> 00:29:36.174
WELL ONE OF THE ISSUE.

00:29:36.241 --> 00:29:39.110
OBVIOUSLY HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS

00:29:39.177 --> 00:29:41.079
HAVE TO FACTOR INTO THIS

00:29:41.146 --> 00:29:42.680
BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING FOR

00:29:42.747 --> 00:29:43.248
HOUSING FOR CALIFORNIANS WHO

00:29:43.314 --> 00:29:46.384
NEED HOUSING. AND AS TO THE

00:29:46.451 --> 00:29:50.121
COST OF HOUSING. THERE ARE MANY

00:29:50.188 --> 00:29:52.790
DRIVING FACTORS BUT HAVE YOU

00:29:52.857 --> 00:29:54.726
LOOKED AT ANY OF THOSE DRIVING

00:29:54.792 --> 00:29:55.960
FACTORS AND THINGS THAT THE

00:29:56.027 --> 00:29:59.664
LEGISLATURE CAN DO TO. HOLD

00:29:59.731 --> 00:30:02.700
BACKSOME OF THE COST FACTORS

00:30:02.767 --> 00:30:04.969
THAT HAVE BEEN DRIVEN BY

00:30:05.036 --> 00:30:07.038
VARIOUS THINGS STATE POLICY.

00:30:07.105 --> 00:30:10.808
LOCAL POLICY PLANNING AT CENTER.

00:30:10.875 --> 00:30:12.577
EXECUTIVE ORDER HAS US WORKING

00:30:12.644 --> 00:30:14.179
LARGELY WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF

00:30:14.245 --> 00:30:17.482
EXISTING STATUTE THE WAY IT WAS

00:30:17.549 --> 00:30:20.518
WRITTEN EMPHASIZES ALTERNATE

00:30:20.585 --> 00:30:21.886
DEVELOPMENTS THAT CAN BE

00:30:21.953 --> 00:30:23.288
CHEAPER WHETHER THAT SUCH TINY

00:30:23.354 --> 00:30:24.622
HOW DEVELOPMENTS A SHIPPING

00:30:24.689 --> 00:30:27.392
CONTAINER DEVELOPMENT USING UP

00:30:27.458 --> 00:30:28.193
OTHER FORMS OF PRE FAB OR OR

00:30:28.259 --> 00:30:30.895
MODULAR CONSTRUCTION. TIMBER

00:30:30.962 --> 00:30:33.965
ACTUALLY CAN BE FOR LEGAL CLUB

00:30:34.032 --> 00:30:36.100
ON EXPENSIVE EXPENSIVE TO BUILD

00:30:36.167 --> 00:30:37.869
SO WE HAVE LOOKED AT WAYS

00:30:37.936 --> 00:30:39.337
WITHIN THE EXISTING FRAMEWORK

00:30:39.404 --> 00:30:41.773
OF PURSUING MORE COST EFFECTIVE

00:30:41.839 --> 00:30:47.111
HOUSING BUT NOW WE HAVEN'T.

00:30:47.178 --> 00:30:47.679
SILLY PROPOSE ANYTHING THAT

00:30:47.745 --> 00:30:51.449
WOULD CHANGE THAT FRAMEWORK.

00:30:51.516 --> 00:30:52.016
AND I JUST OFFER THAT BEING

00:30:52.083 --> 00:30:52.650
ABLE TO DISCOUNT THE LAND VALUE

00:30:52.717 --> 00:30:53.318
AND ENDS UP BEING A HUGE DRIVER

00:30:53.384 --> 00:30:54.586
AND MAKING AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:30:54.652 --> 00:30:55.787
POSSIBLE AND FEASIBLE. IN HIGH

00:30:55.853 --> 00:30:58.122
COST AREAS AND WHILE THIS WOULD

00:30:58.189 --> 00:30:59.524
BE A NEW ENDEAVOR FOR THE STATE

00:30:59.591 --> 00:31:01.926
IT'S A VERY COMMON ENDEAVOR FOR

00:31:01.993 --> 00:31:03.061
AFFORDABLE HOUSING FINANCE TO

00:31:03.127 --> 00:31:05.763
HAVE PUBLIC AGENCIES. BY THE

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:06.898
LOW COST LONG TERM GROUND

00:31:06.965 --> 00:31:08.566
LEASES AND SERVING ALMOST AS

00:31:08.633 --> 00:31:11.102
FIRST IN ACQUISITION FUNDING.

00:31:11.169 --> 00:31:12.937
AND SO IN THIS WAY THE STATUS

00:31:13.004 --> 00:31:14.505
SETTING AN EXAMPLE AND ALSO

00:31:14.572 --> 00:31:15.807
FOLLOWING I'M PRETTY

00:31:15.873 --> 00:31:16.374
ESTABLISHED PRACTICE IN THIS

00:31:16.441 --> 00:31:20.712
REGARD. FOCUSED JUST ON STATE

00:31:20.778 --> 00:31:22.947
PROPERTIES HAVE YOU LOOKED INTO

00:31:23.014 --> 00:31:24.182
NO PRIVATE NON PROFITS THAT

00:31:24.249 --> 00:31:26.718
HAVE DONE THINGS. CALIFORNIAN

00:31:26.784 --> 00:31:27.352
THE DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION FOR

00:31:27.418 --> 00:31:30.822
EXAMPLE IN. MAHAL PIES AND

00:31:30.888 --> 00:31:32.824
DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT OR

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:33.791
IS THAT A PART OF YOUR

00:31:33.858 --> 00:31:36.127
INVENTORY OR NOT. ARMENDARIZ

00:31:36.194 --> 00:31:37.095
FOCUS THE LANDS THAT WE THE

00:31:37.161 --> 00:31:38.596
STATE OWNS AND CONTROLS WE HAVE

00:31:38.663 --> 00:31:40.531
THAT WE HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS

00:31:40.598 --> 00:31:42.734
WITH SOME NONPROFIT AFFORDABLE

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:43.968
HOUSING DEVELOPERS IN TERMS OF

00:31:44.035 --> 00:31:45.203
APPROACH XIN YOU KNOW CONCEPT%

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:47.872
AND THINGS LIKE THAT WE FULLY

00:31:47.939 --> 00:31:50.008
EXPECT ONCE THE MAP GOES PUBLIC

00:31:50.074 --> 00:31:51.709
THAT THERE WILL BE THOSE SORTS

00:31:51.776 --> 00:31:53.011
OF CONVERSATIONS THAT HAPPENED.

00:31:53.077 --> 00:31:53.678
WE WOULD WELCOME THOSE

00:31:53.745 --> 00:31:55.713
CONVERSATIONS HAPPENING BUT

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:56.814
RIGHT NOW OUR FOCUS HAS BEEN

00:31:56.881 --> 00:31:57.515
THAT THE PROPERTY THAT THE

00:31:57.582 --> 00:32:01.286
STATE OWNS WELL I WOULD SUGGEST

00:32:01.352 --> 00:32:03.855
IT BE WELL TO TAKE A LOOK. AT

00:32:03.921 --> 00:32:06.858
THE NATURE OF THE TO THE-

00:32:06.924 --> 00:32:07.458
ELATION YOU'RE GOING TO TRY TO

00:32:07.525 --> 00:32:09.627
PROVIDE IT FOR. AND IF WE'RE

00:32:09.694 --> 00:32:10.161
TALKING ABOUT CHALLENGED

00:32:10.228 --> 00:32:14.699
POPULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE

00:32:14.766 --> 00:32:16.401
HOMELESS HARD CORE LONG TERM

00:32:16.467 --> 00:32:20.238
HOMELESS. WE'RE GLAD TO LOOK A

00:32:20.305 --> 00:32:21.839
HOUSING IN AREAS WHERE THERE

00:32:21.906 --> 00:32:23.107
ARE WOULD BE RESOURCES TO SERVE

00:32:23.174 --> 00:32:27.345
THAT POPULATION. LIKE

00:32:27.412 --> 00:32:27.912
REHABILITATIVE RESOURCES FOR

00:32:27.979 --> 00:32:31.883
THEM. THAT THERE WOULD BE

00:32:31.949 --> 00:32:32.483

OUT WE MAY HAVE GOTTEN A YES

00:35:58.923 --> 00:35:59.490
FOR THE DEPARTMENT YET SO WE'VE

00:35:59.557 --> 00:36:00.825
BEEN PRIMARILY INTERACTING

00:36:00.892 --> 00:36:02.226
AROUND SITES THAT THEY

00:36:02.293 --> 00:36:03.628
THEMSELVES HAVE SAID WE'VE BEEN

00:36:03.694 --> 00:36:05.162
EYEING THIS SITE IN OUR

00:36:05.229 --> 00:36:06.898
JURISDICTION THE LAST TWENTY

00:36:06.964 --> 00:36:08.165
FIVE YEARS. NOTHING'S BEING

00:36:08.232 --> 00:36:09.500
DONE WITH IT TORE IT LOOKS LIKE

00:36:09.567 --> 00:36:11.168

COULD DO SOMETHING ELSE WITH IT

00:36:12.203 --> 00:36:16.173
AND SO. THOSE HAVE BEEN THAT

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:16.641
THE PRIMARY NATURE THE

00:36:16.707 --> 00:36:18.743
INTERACTIONS WITH THE LOCALS.

00:36:18.809 --> 00:36:19.944
WE EXPECT. PUBLISHING OF THE

00:36:20.011 --> 00:36:20.945
HEAT MAP TO CHANGE THAT DYNAMIC

00:36:21.012 --> 00:36:21.812
WE EXPECT THERE TO BE AN INFLUX

00:36:21.879 --> 00:36:22.980
OF. OF MORE OF THOSE

00:36:23.047 --> 00:36:23.481
CONVERSATIONS BOTH LOOK

00:36:23.548 --> 00:36:24.348
AMENITIES AND FOR MEMBERS WE

00:36:24.415 --> 00:36:28.085
ALSO EXPECT. TO BEGIN THE MORE

00:36:28.152 --> 00:36:29.387
FORMALIZED OUT REACHED WITH

00:36:29.453 --> 00:36:30.821
THEM WITH THEM ABOUT OUR

00:36:30.888 --> 00:36:32.523
PARTICULAR SITES. TRYING TO

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:33.791
GATHER LESSONS LEARNED WE PLAN

00:36:33.858 --> 00:36:35.860
ON DOING THAT IN A WAY THAT IS

00:36:35.927 --> 00:36:37.428
STILL SORT OF PRIORITIZE

00:36:37.495 --> 00:36:38.763
WORKLOAD PERSPECTIVE SO. ENOUGH

00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:39.830
SITE MIGHT BE YOU KNOW CHARGE

00:36:39.897 --> 00:36:42.300
SEVEN. IT PROBABLY WON'T HAVE

00:36:42.366 --> 00:36:43.067
THE SAME LEVEL CONVERSATION

00:36:43.134 --> 00:36:44.702
THAT I TRUMP'S ONE OR TWO SITE

00:36:44.769 --> 00:36:45.870
IS GOING TO HAVE. AT LEAST IN

00:36:45.937 --> 00:36:48.539
THE BEGINNING. WE HAVE AND I

00:36:48.606 --> 00:36:50.675
KNOW IN THEIR NUMBERS CAN I

00:36:50.741 --> 00:36:51.943
COME UP IN A MINUTE BUT WE'VE

00:36:52.009 --> 00:36:53.244
ALSO. HAD SOME THROUGH

00:36:53.311 --> 00:36:54.378
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LEAGUE

00:36:54.445 --> 00:36:56.981
OF CITIES AS WELL. WE HAVE SOME

00:36:57.048 --> 00:37:02.753
TENTATIVE PLANS TO DO A WEAPON.

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:03.354
ARE TO THE MEMBERS FOR EXAMPLE

00:37:03.421 --> 00:37:06.257
UPON THE RELEASE OF THE MAP.

00:37:06.324 --> 00:37:07.558
OUR GOAL TO MILLIONS TO GET THE

00:37:07.625 --> 00:37:09.060
WORD OUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:37:09.126 --> 00:37:09.627
THAT THE HEAT MAP ITSELF IS

00:37:09.694 --> 00:37:10.161
FUNCTIONAL USABLE NOT JUST

00:37:10.227 --> 00:37:11.495
FROM. OUR PERSPECTIVE BUT ALSO

00:37:11.562 --> 00:37:12.730
FROM LOCAL DEVELOPERS AND LOCAL

00:37:12.797 --> 00:37:13.331
LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AS

00:37:13.397 --> 00:37:16.867
WELL. SO IT'S BEEN VERY FOCUSED

00:37:16.934 --> 00:37:18.769
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LOCALS

00:37:18.836 --> 00:37:19.503
AND I THINK THE TENOR AND TONE

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:20.671
OF THAT WILL CHANGE ONCE THE

00:37:20.738 --> 00:37:22.873
MAP IS OUT AND- WEBER TALK

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:23.608
ABOUT SPECIFIC PROPERTIES AND

00:37:23.674 --> 00:37:25.176
ISSUES AND THEY HAVE. BUT IT'S

00:37:25.242 --> 00:37:27.845
BEEN ACTIVE IN SURPRISINGLY.

00:37:27.912 --> 00:37:29.714
FRUITFUL AND NO CONCERNS BEEN

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:32.516
RAISED SO FAR NO. NO REAL

00:37:32.583 --> 00:37:34.185
ISSUES WITH ANY LOOK OF AGENCY

00:37:34.251 --> 00:37:36.153
HAVE COME UP. CAN YOU GIVE ME A

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:39.256
SENSE OF HOW MUCH. COERCIVE

00:37:39.323 --> 00:37:43.294
POWER THE STATE HAS. WITHIN THE

00:37:43.361 --> 00:37:49.900
CONTEXT OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDER.

00:37:49.967 --> 00:37:51.736
AND HOW YEAH WHAT WAS IS THIS

00:37:51.802 --> 00:37:52.803
IS THIS IS THE TRUE REALLY TERM

00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:53.838
EARLY VOLUNTARY PARTNERSHIP

00:37:53.904 --> 00:37:55.006
THING OR IT OR IS THERE A BIT

00:37:55.072 --> 00:37:57.942
OF A STICK ASSOCIATED I THINK

00:37:58.009 --> 00:37:58.476
THAT THE BEST REVENGE THE

00:37:58.542 --> 00:38:02.380
QUESTION IS. IS IT'S REALLY

00:38:02.446 --> 00:38:06.450
COMPLICATED. THIRD EVERYTHING

00:38:06.517 --> 00:38:07.718
FROM YOU KNOW ALL ALL TAKE OFF

00:38:07.785 --> 00:38:08.953
A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE YOU KNOW

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:09.987
EVEN EVEN IF THE STATE COULD

00:38:10.054 --> 00:38:10.955
COME IN AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT

00:38:11.022 --> 00:38:12.056
WE'RE DROPPING A UNIT REGULARS

00:38:12.123 --> 00:38:13.057
PROPERTY NO ONE CAN GAINS THAT

00:38:13.124 --> 00:38:13.791
WE STILL HAVE TO CONNECT TO

00:38:13.858 --> 00:38:15.159
LOCAL POWER WATER SEWER GASES

00:38:15.226 --> 00:38:16.527
THOSE CONVERSATIONS HAPPEN NO

00:38:16.594 --> 00:38:18.396
MATTER WHAT AND THEN. AND THEN

00:38:18.462 --> 00:38:19.497
SEE WHAT PLAYS INTO THINGS AS

00:38:19.563 --> 00:38:22.099
WELL. ANOTHER SOME THERE'S SOME

00:38:22.166 --> 00:38:23.768
HOUSING EXEMPTIONS FOR SEQUEL

00:38:23.834 --> 00:38:24.869
BUT THOSE ARE SPECIFICIT DOES

00:38:24.935 --> 00:38:26.103
REQUIRE YOU KNOW BY PRESENTING

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:27.304
A SOURCE ULTIMATELY AND SO

00:38:27.371 --> 00:38:29.173
THERE'S A NUMBER OF A VARIETY

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:31.242
OF CONVERSATIONS THAT THERE'S

00:38:31.308 --> 00:38:33.077
NO. THERE'S NO WAY I THINK FOR

00:38:33.144 --> 00:38:34.979
THE STATE TO COME IN AND JUST.

00:38:35.046 --> 00:38:35.546
KIND OF BUSINESS TABLES THEY

00:38:35.613 --> 00:38:36.213
WERE PUTTING SOMETHING THERE

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.148
WITHOUT SOME DEGREE OF

00:38:37.214 --> 00:38:38.249
INVOLVEMENT OUR PREFERENCE

00:38:38.315 --> 00:38:41.652
OBVIOUSLY EVER TALK ABOUT

00:38:41.719 --> 00:38:42.653
PRIORITIZING SITES YOU KNOW

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:43.788
GOING BACK TO BEEN DIAGRAM.

00:38:43.854 --> 00:38:45.856
THERE'S THE FOLKS WHO WHO ARE

00:38:45.923 --> 00:38:48.059

SPEEDING GETTING SITES OUT

00:38:51.729 --> 00:38:52.163
WE'RE OBVIOUSLY CAN BE

00:38:52.229 --> 00:38:53.931
PARTNERING WITH THOSE ENTITIES

00:38:53.998 --> 00:38:54.765
WHO WERE HOUSING IS NEEDED

00:38:54.832 --> 00:38:56.200
WHERE TO GET A GOOD SITE AND

00:38:56.267 --> 00:38:57.635
WHERE THEY ARE SUPPORTIVE AND

00:38:57.702 --> 00:38:59.637
ENGAGED THOSE ARE THE ONES I

00:38:59.704 --> 00:39:08.079
THINK THEY'RE GONNA GET. THE

00:39:08.145 --> 00:39:15.553
EARLIEST DEVELOPMENTS COME OUT.

00:39:15.619 --> 00:39:18.022
BUT BEYOND THAT YEAH WE- THE

00:39:18.089 --> 00:39:18.956
THAT THE QUEEN OF THE STATE

00:39:19.023 --> 00:39:20.858
ISN'T SUBJECT TO. YOU KNOW.

00:39:20.925 --> 00:39:21.425
LOCAL ZONING AND THINGS LIKE

00:39:21.492 --> 00:39:24.028
THAT SO. WHILE WE ARE NOT

00:39:24.095 --> 00:39:24.695
CITIES OF THOSE THINGS OUR

00:39:24.762 --> 00:39:25.629
FOCUS HAS BEEN WE ONE HAVE AN

00:39:25.696 --> 00:39:26.230
ACTIVE PARTNERSHIP BECAUSE WE

00:39:26.297 --> 00:39:27.264
RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S- THERE

00:39:27.331 --> 00:39:27.865
REALLY IS A TIE BETWEEN WHAT

00:39:27.932 --> 00:39:28.466
WE'RE DOING AND THE COMMITTEE

00:39:28.532 --> 00:39:29.033

MIGHT ASSIST WITH. GETTING

00:39:34.638 --> 00:39:40.177
THESE. PROJECTS OUT FASTER

00:39:40.244 --> 00:39:40.644
THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY

00:39:40.711 --> 00:39:41.212
CONVERSATION ABOUT POTENTIAL

00:39:41.278 --> 00:39:44.615
LEGISLATION. OKAY OBVIOUSLY

00:39:44.682 --> 00:39:45.649

STOCK AND IN DOING SO IN A WAY

00:39:51.822 --> 00:39:56.160
THAT'S. BOTH RESPECTFUL OF

00:39:56.227 --> 00:39:56.794
LOCALS WHILE ALSO UNDERSTANDING

00:39:56.861 --> 00:40:00.197
THAT YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T. BM

00:40:00.264 --> 00:40:01.232

ARE YOU WANTED ADDED YEAH I

00:40:03.134 --> 00:40:04.168
JUST SAY THAT FOR SOME OF THE

00:40:04.235 --> 00:40:04.735
JURISDICTIONS THAT ALREADY

00:40:04.802 --> 00:40:05.336
STEPPED FORWARD AND DESCRIBE

00:40:05.402 --> 00:40:06.270
THEIR WILLINGNESS THERE

00:40:06.337 --> 00:40:06.837
DEMONSTRATING THAT IN A FEW

00:40:06.904 --> 00:40:07.605
DIFFERENT WAYS THEY MAY BE

00:40:07.671 --> 00:40:08.606
EXAMINING WHAT KIND OF LOCAL

00:40:08.672 --> 00:40:10.341
FUNDING THEY HAVE AVAILABLE TO

00:40:10.407 --> 00:40:11.342
COMMIT TO THE DEAL WHETHER

00:40:11.408 --> 00:40:12.576
THAT'S FROM THE LOCAL

00:40:12.643 --> 00:40:14.011
JURISDICTION ITSELF FOR FROM

00:40:14.078 --> 00:40:15.212
THE LOCAL HOUSING AUTHORITY. SO

00:40:15.279 --> 00:40:16.781
THEY'RE EXPLORING THOSE THINGS

00:40:16.847 --> 00:40:17.848
THEY'RE ALSO THINKING ABOUT

00:40:17.915 --> 00:40:19.984
WHAT THEIR PERMIT PROCESSES

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:21.085
GENERALLY AND WHILE IT MIGHT

00:40:21.152 --> 00:40:23.220
NOT APPLY STRICTLY HERE THEY

00:40:23.287 --> 00:40:24.822
pMAY HAVE A LOCAL LIAISON THAT

00:40:24.889 --> 00:40:25.923
COULD REALLY HELP FACILITATE

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:27.458
SOME OF THE COMMUNITY OUTREACH

00:40:27.525 --> 00:40:29.059
FACILITATE ANY OF THE

00:40:29.126 --> 00:40:30.227
DISCUSSIONS WITH LOCAL PUBLIC

00:40:30.294 --> 00:40:31.729
WORKS AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO

00:40:31.796 --> 00:40:34.698
THOSE. ARE GOOD DEMONSTRATIONS

00:40:34.765 --> 00:40:35.933
OF WILLINGNESS BEYOND JUST

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.635
STATING CELL RIGHT BUT REALLY

00:40:37.701 --> 00:40:39.103
SHOWING THAT THEY ARE BEING

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:41.906
INTROSPECTIVE AND HOW THEY CAN

00:40:41.972 --> 00:40:42.473
CONTINUE TO FACILITATE THIS

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:45.242
PARTNERSHIP. MIGHT BE SOME

00:40:45.309 --> 00:40:45.843
OTHER QUALITATIVE THINGS THAT

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:47.478
WE WOULD LOOK FOR MYSELF FOR

00:40:47.545 --> 00:40:49.847
ONE FINAL QUESTION WHAT CAN YOU

00:40:49.914 --> 00:40:51.615
GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT SORT OF

00:40:51.682 --> 00:40:55.119
ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS

00:40:55.186 --> 00:40:55.619
ARE BEING TAKEN IN THE

00:40:55.686 --> 00:40:56.987
DEVELOPMENT OF THIS HOUSING.

00:40:57.054 --> 00:40:59.590
YOU KNOW LEAD CERTIFICATION AND

00:40:59.657 --> 00:41:00.724
YOU KNOW OTHER AT BEST

00:41:00.791 --> 00:41:07.298
PRACTICES GIVEN OUR. OUR OTHER

00:41:07.364 --> 00:41:07.898
KIND OF BROADER SUSTAINABILITY

00:41:07.965 --> 00:41:12.536
GOALS AS A STATE. YEAH I MEAN I

00:41:12.603 --> 00:41:16.040
THINK. WE WILL BE ENCOURAGING

00:41:16.106 --> 00:41:17.074
DEVELOPERS TO. ALONG THOSE

00:41:17.141 --> 00:41:19.810
LINES. OTHER THERE'S YOU KNOW A

00:41:19.877 --> 00:41:21.345
EXISTING EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT

00:41:21.412 --> 00:41:22.313
GENTLY GOVERN HOW WE BUILD

00:41:22.379 --> 00:41:24.615
THINGS IN THE STATE IS THE OLD

00:41:24.682 --> 00:41:25.716
EXECUTIVE ORDER REQUIRES THE

00:41:25.783 --> 00:41:28.219
SILVER FOR EXAMPLE THE MINIMUM.

00:41:28.285 --> 00:41:29.119
WE'RE STILL DOING THE ANALYSIS

00:41:29.186 --> 00:41:29.920
TO SEE YOU KNOW WHETHER THOSE

00:41:29.987 --> 00:41:31.455
THINGS. APPLY ULTIMATELY TO THE

00:41:31.522 --> 00:41:31.922
SORT OF DEVELOPER LET

00:41:31.989 --> 00:41:33.691
PROPOSALS. BUT EXECUTIVE ORDER

00:41:33.757 --> 00:41:35.426
IS PRETTY CLEAR AND DIRECTING

00:41:35.492 --> 00:41:38.229
US TO SCORE FAVORABLY THOSE WHO

00:41:38.295 --> 00:41:39.196
TO FOCUS ON AND MORE

00:41:39.263 --> 00:41:40.464
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. THAT'S

00:41:40.531 --> 00:41:41.932
I THINK BOTH THE MATERIALITY AS

00:41:41.999 --> 00:41:42.867
AN APPROACH AND APPROACHES SO

00:41:42.933 --> 00:41:43.868
THAT'S AIMING AT CARBON

00:41:43.934 --> 00:41:45.169
NEUTRALITY THROUGH.

00:41:45.236 --> 00:41:47.938
ELECTRIFICATION WHETHER THAT'S

00:41:48.005 --> 00:41:50.374
YOU KNOW INSTALLATION OF SELECT

00:41:50.441 --> 00:41:52.376
PANELS VERSES AN OFFSITE BPA

00:41:52.443 --> 00:41:52.977
MILL ALL ALL THOSE THINGS ARE

00:41:53.043 --> 00:41:54.144
BEING ARE GONNA BE LOOKED AT

00:41:54.211 --> 00:41:56.380
THE OUR FEES. BUT WE DON'T HAVE

00:41:56.447 --> 00:41:57.348
AT PRESENT AT LEAST LIKE A

00:41:57.414 --> 00:41:58.515
MINIMUM SET UP TO SENSIBLE

00:41:58.582 --> 00:42:00.851
CRITERIA BEYOND WANTING TO MAKE

00:42:00.918 --> 00:42:02.987
SURE THAT THIS IS APPROACH CPOS

00:42:03.053 --> 00:42:08.058
ASSEMBLY. AND IN A COST

00:42:08.125 --> 00:42:08.659
EFFECTIVE WAY LIKE WE DO WITH

00:42:08.726 --> 00:42:12.997
THE STATE DEVELOPMENTS. AND

00:42:13.063 --> 00:42:13.564
THEN I'D ADD THAT A LOT OF

00:42:13.631 --> 00:42:14.098
AFFORDABLE HOUSING FINANCE

00:42:14.164 --> 00:42:15.132
MECHANISMS DO REQUIRE SOME

00:42:15.199 --> 00:42:15.699
DEGREE OF CONSIDERATION FOR

00:42:15.766 --> 00:42:17.434
ENVIRONMENTAL. SUSTAINABILITY

00:42:17.501 --> 00:42:18.035
WITHIN THE PROPERTY AND THEN

00:42:18.102 --> 00:42:18.702
FURTHER KIND OF LOOKING AT

00:42:18.769 --> 00:42:19.336
OPERATIONAL SUSTAINABILITY OR

00:42:19.403 --> 00:42:20.170
EVEN SUSTAINABILITY OF

00:42:20.237 --> 00:42:21.105
HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE LIVING AT

00:42:21.171 --> 00:42:22.039
THESE PROPERTIES. THIS BECOMES

00:42:22.106 --> 00:42:22.606
REALLY IMPORTANT OF WHY WE

00:42:22.673 --> 00:42:24.174
MIGHT CONSIDER LOCATION OF THE

00:42:24.241 --> 00:42:25.476
PROPERTY SO MAKING SURE THAT

00:42:25.542 --> 00:42:26.010
IT'S CONNECTED TO TRANSIT

00:42:26.076 --> 00:42:28.012
NETWORKS. GOOD HIGHER QUALITY

00:42:28.078 --> 00:42:29.813
TRANSIT AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:32.082
REALLY BEING ABLE TO LIMIT THE

00:42:32.149 --> 00:42:32.683
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS BY

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:33.851
DECREASING THE AMOUNT OF THE M.

00:42:33.918 --> 00:42:35.319
T. THAT'S COMING FROM THESE

00:42:35.386 --> 00:42:37.121
HOUSEHOLDS JUST BY VIRTUE OF

00:42:37.187 --> 00:42:38.856
HAVING THEM CLOSER TO JOBS

00:42:38.923 --> 00:42:40.057
CLOSER TO EDUCATION. CLOSER TO

00:42:40.124 --> 00:42:41.392
TRANSIT WHAT ELSE IF IT'S NOT

00:42:41.458 --> 00:42:43.494
GOING TO CONTINUE TO TRAFFIC I

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:44.695
MEAN THAT THE ALL THE SORTS OF

00:42:44.762 --> 00:42:45.329
THINGS OF THE KINDS OF THINGS I

00:42:45.396 --> 00:42:47.765
THINK THAT'LL MAKE DON. CAM

00:42:47.831 --> 00:42:48.499
COMMUNITIES ON THE GROUND FEEL

00:42:48.565 --> 00:42:49.466
MORE COMFORTABLE. JUST SO I

00:42:49.533 --> 00:42:50.434
UNDERSTAND THE PLAN A BASIC

00:42:50.501 --> 00:42:51.802
MECHANISMS YOU HAVE. BASICALLY

00:42:51.869 --> 00:42:56.040
A FIND. AND THEN YOU YOU YOU'RE

00:42:56.106 --> 00:43:01.979
GETTING DEVELOPERS. FUTURE OF

00:43:02.046 --> 00:43:04.014
MATCHING UP SPACE. WITH A MALE

00:43:04.081 --> 00:43:04.548
ALL THESE PRODUCTS WILL BE

00:43:04.615 --> 00:43:07.017
DEVELOPED BY PRIVATE.

00:43:07.084 --> 00:43:08.285
DEVELOPERS YEAH THE AMBIENT ME

00:43:08.352 --> 00:43:09.486
ANTI THE INTENTION IS THAT THE

00:43:09.553 --> 00:43:10.654
STATE BRINGS THE PROPER TO THE

00:43:10.721 --> 00:43:12.122
TABLE AD WE BRING THE ABILITY

00:43:12.189 --> 00:43:13.791
TO LEASE AT VERY LOW COST AND

00:43:13.857 --> 00:43:15.592
LONG TERM DEVELOPERS WOULD COME

00:43:15.659 --> 00:43:16.527
AND THEY WOULD PROPOSE BE

00:43:16.593 --> 00:43:18.429
AWARDED IT THEY WOULD BUILD OWN

00:43:18.495 --> 00:43:20.097
AND OPERATE THE IMPROVEMENTS

00:43:20.164 --> 00:43:21.131
WITH THE WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL

00:43:21.198 --> 00:43:23.767
LONG TERM GROUND LEASE TO THEM.

00:43:23.834 --> 00:43:25.536
SO IT'S ALL OF FOR IT'S A IT'S

00:43:25.602 --> 00:43:26.603
A I HAD A PERSON FROM HOUSING

00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:27.738
MINISTER THEREFORE I 2% IT

00:43:27.805 --> 00:43:29.206
WOULD IT WOULD DEPEND ON THE

00:43:29.273 --> 00:43:31.175
MARKET ITSELF THE TYPES OF

00:43:31.241 --> 00:43:32.076
HOUSING SUBSIDIES THAT ARE

00:43:32.142 --> 00:43:34.545
AVAILABLE HOW THE DEAL PENCILS

00:43:34.611 --> 00:43:35.846
HOW MUCH ARE PROPERTY VALUE

00:43:35.913 --> 00:43:37.348
THAT'S US. SOME OF THE

00:43:37.414 --> 00:43:43.354
PROPERTIES MAY BE ON A PERCENT.

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:43.921
OTHERS ARE GOING TO BE MORE

00:43:43.988 --> 00:43:44.555
TRADITIONAL IN A MARKET FOR ALL

00:43:44.621 --> 00:43:48.859
MIXES. BUT MORE TRADITIONAL AS

00:43:48.926 --> 00:43:51.628
IN 10% OF OUR HOUSING. NO I

00:43:51.695 --> 00:43:52.796
THINK WE COULD WE ARE EXPLORING

00:43:52.863 --> 00:43:54.398
MIXED INCOME DEVELOPMENTS AND

00:43:54.465 --> 00:43:55.165
FACT IS THERE A MINIMUM

00:43:55.232 --> 00:43:55.766
AFFORDABLE HOUSING NOT SPELLED

00:43:55.833 --> 00:43:56.700
OUT IN THE EXECUTIVE ORDER AND

00:43:56.767 --> 00:43:57.301
SO I THINK THIS IS MORE THAT

00:43:57.368 --> 00:43:57.835
WILL EXPLORE WITH THE REAL

00:43:57.901 --> 00:43:58.435
ESTATE DUE DILIGENCE WHAT CAN

00:43:58.502 --> 00:43:59.336
THE PROPERTY BY ITSELF SUPPORT

00:43:59.403 --> 00:44:00.537
WHAT OTHER FINANCING COULD COME

00:44:00.604 --> 00:44:01.171
IN TO HELP SUPPORT DEEPER

00:44:01.238 --> 00:44:03.774
AFFORDABILITY. AND SO THAT'S

00:44:03.841 --> 00:44:05.376
SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT WE

00:44:05.442 --> 00:44:06.877
DON'T YET KNOW UNTIL WE GET

00:44:06.944 --> 00:44:08.912
DEEPER INTO THE SITES I'D SAY

00:44:08.979 --> 00:44:10.147
THAT THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A

00:44:10.214 --> 00:44:11.415
STRONG FOCUS ON AFFORDABILITY

00:44:11.482 --> 00:44:13.450
IN EACH SHE BEATS ROLE IN EACH

00:44:13.517 --> 00:44:14.685
CITY SERVICE OF PROVIDING

00:44:14.752 --> 00:44:16.487
AFFORDABLE OR LOANS TO CREATE

00:44:16.553 --> 00:44:17.955
AFFORDABLE HOUSING I THINK THAT

00:44:18.022 --> 00:44:19.490
THAT IS INTENTIONAL RIGHT SO

00:44:19.556 --> 00:44:21.225
WILL BE CONSIDERING THE WAYS

00:44:21.291 --> 00:44:23.827
THAT WE CAN SUPPORT. ON THESE

00:44:23.894 --> 00:44:25.596
DEVELOPERS AND EXPLORING THE

00:44:25.662 --> 00:44:27.297
FINANCING OPTION RIGHT MISS

00:44:27.364 --> 00:44:29.533
HOUSING WINNING TO OUR FIND

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:31.668
FINANCING ALONE THIS WAS WHEN

00:44:31.735 --> 00:44:33.270
YOU'RE GIVING THEM THAT THAT

00:44:33.337 --> 00:44:35.973
PRETTY CONSIDERABLE GIFT OF. A

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:37.508
FREE LAND RIGHT WHICH DOES HELP

00:44:37.574 --> 00:44:38.142
DISCOUNT IT QUITE A BIT I WOULD

00:44:38.208 --> 00:44:39.076
THINK SO YEAH BUT YOU KNOW WE

00:44:39.143 --> 00:44:39.643
HAVE HEARD FROM OTHER LOCAL

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:40.310
GOVERNMENTS TO THERE'S YOU KNOW

00:44:40.377 --> 00:44:41.578
SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE

00:44:41.645 --> 00:44:42.546
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK

00:44:42.613 --> 00:44:44.248
OF MODERATE INCOME HOUSING SURE

00:44:44.314 --> 00:44:46.216
SO SOMETHING LIKE SOME MODERATE

00:44:46.283 --> 00:44:47.684
UNITS PERHAPS SOME ABOVE

00:44:47.751 --> 00:44:48.685
MODERATE UNITS COULD HELP

00:44:48.752 --> 00:44:50.254
OFFSET THE DEEPER AFFORDABILITY

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:52.756
AND STILL GET TO VERY LOW SO.

00:44:52.823 --> 00:44:53.357
THIS IS WHERE WE DON'T WANT TO

00:44:53.424 --> 00:44:54.158
LIMIT THE CREATIVITY THAT THE

00:44:54.224 --> 00:44:56.660
AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS

00:44:56.727 --> 00:44:58.028
FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADVOCACY

00:44:58.095 --> 00:44:58.662
ORGANIZATIONS MIGHT BE ABLE TO

00:44:58.729 --> 00:45:04.835
BRING AS THEY. LOOK AT SOME OF

00:45:04.902 --> 00:45:05.402
THE PROPERTIES THAT WE HAVE

00:45:05.469 --> 00:45:10.207
AVAILABLE. BUT NO NOTHING

00:45:10.274 --> 00:45:10.874
SPELLED OUT ABOUT SPECIFIC

00:45:10.941 --> 00:45:11.475
AFFORDABILITY MIXES WITHIN THE

00:45:11.542 --> 00:45:17.114
L. JUST A ALONG THE LINES OF

00:45:17.181 --> 00:45:17.915
THAT QUESTION. YEAH THE

00:45:17.981 --> 00:45:19.083
GOVERNOR I REALLY. APPRECIATE

00:45:19.149 --> 00:45:20.918
HAVE A PRETTY THE GOVERNOR'S

00:45:20.984 --> 00:45:21.985
YOU APPROACH TO THAT ARE

00:45:22.052 --> 00:45:25.789
PROVIDING. OF THE AFFORDABLE

00:45:25.856 --> 00:45:26.390
HOUSING THAT OUR MEETING. YOU

KNOW THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS.

00:45:29.126 --> 00:45:30.194
I GUESS MY CONCERN HERE IS HOW

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:30.794
DO WE GO ABOUT WITH THE LOCAL

00:45:30.861 --> 00:45:37.267
COMMUNITIES. AND NOT CREATE A

00:45:37.334 --> 00:45:38.302
SIMILAR TYPE OF SITUATION WHERE

00:45:38.368 --> 00:45:40.404
YOU HAVE THE NIMBIS OR SOMEBODY

00:45:40.471 --> 00:45:41.038
JUST COMING HERE EVEN WHERE THE

00:45:41.105 --> 00:45:43.874
STATE'S. GIVEN THESE HOUSING

00:45:43.941 --> 00:45:49.646
THE GOOD THIS LAND IN. SO I'M

00:45:49.713 --> 00:45:51.381
I'M INTERESTED IN WHAT THE

00:45:51.448 --> 00:45:53.884
ENTITLEMENT PROCESS YOU KNOW MY

00:45:53.951 --> 00:45:55.419
LOOK LIKE IF IT'S PREMATURE ON

00:45:55.486 --> 00:45:56.987
THAT THAT'S FINE THAT'S THE

00:45:57.054 --> 00:45:59.590
ACCEPTABLE AT A ANSWER BUT I

00:45:59.656 --> 00:46:00.591
BUT WHAT I'M HOPING IS THAT WE

00:46:00.657 --> 00:46:03.093
HAVE THE ABILITY TO YOU KNOW

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:03.727
WORK WITH CITY STAFF EVERYTHING

00:46:03.794 --> 00:46:07.998
AND NOT. PROVIDE THIS POLITICAL.

00:46:08.065 --> 00:46:11.135
SOMETIMES DIATRIBE TO DOT MY

00:46:11.201 --> 00:46:15.873
BACKYARD. AND YOUR WORK CLOSELY

00:46:15.939 --> 00:46:17.674
WITH THE DEVELOPER THE

00:46:17.741 --> 00:46:18.375
NONPROFIT COMMUNITY IN THE

00:46:18.442 --> 00:46:20.444
STATE IN THE IN THE LOCAL

00:46:20.511 --> 00:46:22.980
GOVERNMENT WITHOUT SETTING UP.

00:46:23.046 --> 00:46:25.048
THESE MASSIVE PUBLIC HEARINGS

00:46:25.115 --> 00:46:26.817
TO YOUR WHICH MADE TO SWAY

00:46:26.884 --> 00:46:28.585
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS I EAT COUNCIL

00:46:28.652 --> 00:46:31.255
MEMBERS FROM THE SUPPORTING A

00:46:31.321 --> 00:46:33.790
PROJECT LIKE THAT. YEAH AND TO

00:46:33.857 --> 00:46:35.159
SALAS POINT I MEAN THERE I

00:46:35.225 --> 00:46:41.131
THINK THAT'S WHERE THE STATE'S.

00:46:41.198 --> 00:46:42.699
A LOT OF THAT FACTORS AND I

00:46:42.766 --> 00:46:43.867
MEAN WE AREN'T SUBJECT

00:46:43.934 --> 00:46:46.069
TECHNICALLY TO TONING OR

00:46:46.136 --> 00:46:46.670
PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVALS

00:46:46.737 --> 00:46:47.638
ARE THOSE SORTS OF THINGS.

00:46:47.704 --> 00:46:48.906
SEQUEL IN THE LAST MINUTES IT'S

00:46:48.972 --> 00:46:50.307
VERY MUCH A PUBLIC INPUT

00:46:50.374 --> 00:46:52.342
PROCESS AND SO YOU KNOW THAT'S

00:46:52.409 --> 00:46:53.310
THAT'S WHAT THAT'S DESIGNED TO

00:46:53.377 --> 00:46:54.311
DO IS LIST OF IMPORTANCE OTHER

00:46:54.378 --> 00:46:55.746
CERTAINLY GONNA BE THAT ELEMENT

00:46:55.812 --> 00:46:57.714
TO IT. BUT YEAH I MEAN I THINK

00:46:57.781 --> 00:46:58.315
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT LOCAL

00:46:58.382 --> 00:47:00.017
GOVERNMENTS NATURALLY HAVE TO

00:47:00.083 --> 00:47:01.585
GO THROUGH IN THEIR OWN

00:47:01.652 --> 00:47:04.054
JURISDICTIONS WE ARE SUBJECT TO

00:47:04.121 --> 00:47:05.289
AND BEING ABLE TO KIND OF DO

00:47:05.355 --> 00:47:07.424
THAT IN A COLLABORATIVE WAY

00:47:07.491 --> 00:47:10.127
WITH THEM THAT STILL. IS NOT TO

00:47:10.194 --> 00:47:12.329
THE PORTAL TO THE COMMUNITY BUT

00:47:12.396 --> 00:47:16.733
DOES FOCUS. ON ON DEVELOPMENT

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:17.367
IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY IS KIND OF

00:47:17.434 --> 00:47:23.040
ORACLE. SENATOR RUBIO DID

00:47:23.106 --> 00:47:25.475
SENATOR NIELSEN THANK YOU. HAVE

00:47:25.542 --> 00:47:27.544
A QUESTION ABOUT REDEVELOPMENT

00:47:27.611 --> 00:47:30.647
LAND I KNOW DOWNTOWN A LOT OF

00:47:30.714 --> 00:47:32.516
LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES PURCHASE

00:47:32.583 --> 00:47:33.383
AND WITH THE DEVELOPMENT

00:47:33.450 --> 00:47:35.786
FUNDING AND THEN WHEN IT WENT

00:47:35.852 --> 00:47:36.486
AWAY HOW SOME OF THE LAND WAS

00:47:36.553 --> 00:47:37.487
LEFT IN LIMBO. BY WAY OF

00:47:37.554 --> 00:47:39.223
EXAMPLE I REMEMBER WE HAD A

00:47:39.289 --> 00:47:41.058
PARCEL WHERE IT WAS

00:47:41.124 --> 00:47:41.892
REDEVELOPMENT A BOLD SITES VERY

00:47:41.959 --> 00:47:44.194
SMALL AND THERE WAS A PIECE IN

00:47:44.261 --> 00:47:44.761
THE CENTER THAT WE'RE GONNA

00:47:44.828 --> 00:47:46.830
PURCHASE FOR MY PRIVATE OWNER

00:47:46.897 --> 00:47:47.431
SO THAT WE CAN CONSOLIDATE THE

00:47:47.497 --> 00:47:48.665
LAN AND CREATE SOMETHING BIG

00:47:48.732 --> 00:47:50.767
BUT- THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN AND ONE

00:47:50.834 --> 00:47:52.236
AWAY BUT THOSE TWO PARCELS WERE

00:47:52.302 --> 00:47:56.907
STILL LEFT. IN LIMBO SO. TO

00:47:56.974 --> 00:47:57.541
SPEAK CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT AND

00:47:57.608 --> 00:48:01.311
HOW ARGUE. GOING TO DETERMINE

00:48:01.378 --> 00:48:01.945
LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IN THAT CASE I

00:48:02.012 --> 00:48:02.546
JUST EXPRESS IT WOULD BE VERY

00:48:02.613 --> 00:48:05.349
DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO SEE. THAT

00:48:05.415 --> 00:48:05.949
THAT THERE'S A POTENTIAL THERE

00:48:06.016 --> 00:48:06.850
BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO SMALL

00:48:06.917 --> 00:48:09.653
PIECES ARE YOU GOING INTO

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:10.120
CITIES AND ASKING FOR

00:48:10.187 --> 00:48:12.456
INFORMATION FROM PRIOR LAND.

00:48:12.522 --> 00:48:14.157
HOW WE WOULD INVITE ANY CITY

00:48:14.224 --> 00:48:16.460
THAT HAS AN INVENTORY AVAILABLE

00:48:16.526 --> 00:48:18.328
TO CONSIDER HOW THEIR INVENTORY

00:48:18.395 --> 00:48:19.630
MIGHT ALIGN WITH OURS AND SO I

00:48:19.696 --> 00:48:20.998
THINK ONCE WE REVEALED A HEAT

00:48:21.064 --> 00:48:21.999
MAP THAT WILL BE MUCH MORE

00:48:22.065 --> 00:48:24.935
TRANSPARENT. AND I THINK THERE

00:48:25.002 --> 00:48:26.837
IS SOME PENDING LEGISLATION

00:48:26.903 --> 00:48:27.704
KIND OF SPEAKING TO THIS RIGHT

00:48:27.771 --> 00:48:30.674
NOW THAT ASIDE. WE'LL BE ABLE

00:48:30.741 --> 00:48:33.076
TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS IN

00:48:33.143 --> 00:48:34.378
THAT SPECIFIC SCENARIO THAT YOU

00:48:34.444 --> 00:48:35.946
DESCRIBED IF THE FORMER

00:48:36.013 --> 00:48:37.281
REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY WANTED TO

00:48:37.347 --> 00:48:39.016
TALK TO US ABOUT HOW SOME OF

00:48:39.082 --> 00:48:41.351
OUR SITES MAY BE ADJACENT OR

00:48:41.418 --> 00:48:42.686
HOW WE MABEL TO BE ABLE TO SWAP

00:48:42.753 --> 00:48:45.322
OR COMBINED. THOSE ARE THE TYPE-OF CONVERSATIONS THE TREASONS

00:48:45.389 --> 00:48:46.790
MENTIONING WE EXPECT TO BE

00:48:46.857 --> 00:48:49.059
HAVING MORE OF I'M WE DO KNOW

00:48:49.126 --> 00:48:50.694
THAT WHETHER IT'S FORMER

00:48:50.761 --> 00:48:51.962
REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES

00:48:52.029 --> 00:48:53.063
LOCALITIES ON ME YOU KNOW

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:54.865
CITIES OR COUNTIES. PUBLIC

00:48:54.931 --> 00:48:55.899
HOUSING AUTHORITIES TRANSIT

00:48:55.966 --> 00:48:57.734
AGENCIES THERE'S A LOT OF

00:48:57.801 --> 00:48:59.870
ENTITIES THAT DO HAVE PUBLICLY

00:48:59.936 --> 00:49:01.338
OWNED LAND THAT MAY FIT THOSE

00:49:01.405 --> 00:49:02.339
TYPES OF DESCRIPTIONS THAT YOU

00:49:02.406 --> 00:49:07.878
JUST SHARED SO. WE. LOOK

00:49:07.944 --> 00:49:08.445
FORWARD TO SEEING HOW THOSE

00:49:08.512 --> 00:49:09.012
INVENTORIES MY MATCH UP WITH

00:49:09.079 --> 00:49:13.550
OURS. YEAH I ONLY ADD THAT YEAH

00:49:13.617 --> 00:49:16.053
UNFORTUNATELY ALL WE ARE AWARE

00:49:16.119 --> 00:49:16.620
OF ARE THE PROPERTIES AT THE

00:49:16.687 --> 00:49:17.721
STATE OWNS AND CONTROLS. AND SO

00:49:17.788 --> 00:49:18.989
THOSE THOSE SYNERGIES WE ARE

00:49:19.056 --> 00:49:20.290
KIND OF DEPENDENT ON THE LOCALS

00:49:20.357 --> 00:49:20.857
FROM TO BRING UP AND PARTNER

00:49:20.924 --> 00:49:23.427
WITH US ON. SO AT THIS POINT WE

00:49:23.493 --> 00:49:25.429
ARE GOING TO DO OF SOME KIND OF

00:49:25.495 --> 00:49:27.564
EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGN SOUL.

00:49:27.631 --> 00:49:29.299
CITIES TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS

00:49:29.366 --> 00:49:30.867
IS A PROCESS THAT YOU'RE GOING

00:49:30.934 --> 00:49:31.335
THROUGH AND THAT THAT

00:49:31.401 --> 00:49:34.371
INFORMATION WOULD BE VITAL.

00:49:34.438 --> 00:49:36.073
OKAY THE WHAT WAS THE MAP IS

00:49:36.139 --> 00:49:37.040
PUBLISHED WE ARE EXPECTING TO

00:49:37.107 --> 00:49:40.410
DO A SIGNIFICANT ABOUT REACHES

00:49:40.477 --> 00:49:44.681
BACK THANK YOU. CENTER NIELSEN.

00:49:44.748 --> 00:49:45.282
HARDING IS AN ISSUE THAT MUST

00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:49.019
BE. COGNIZANT OF. OVER THE

00:49:49.086 --> 00:49:54.191
YEARS. BUDGET PARTICULARLY I

00:49:54.257 --> 00:49:55.392
WATCH THESE AGENCIES HAVE

00:49:55.459 --> 00:50:02.299
PROPERTIES. ONE H. BERDIRI

00:50:02.366 --> 00:50:04.434
IMPOSSIBLE SOMETIMES TO GET THE

00:50:04.501 --> 00:50:06.069
INVENTORY OF WHAT THEY HAVE I

00:50:06.136 --> 00:50:07.604
KNOW RECENT EFFORTS MADE BY

00:50:07.671 --> 00:50:09.406
OTHER MEMBERS HERE IN THE LAST

00:50:09.473 --> 00:50:12.109
TEN YEARS TO GET INFORMATION

00:50:12.175 --> 00:50:12.609
FROM AGENCIES ABOUT WHAT

00:50:12.676 --> 00:50:13.143
PROPERTY THEY HAVE THAT IS

00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:15.045
ACCESS BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY

00:50:15.112 --> 00:50:19.216
DATA. I WOULD ASSUME THAT IT IS

00:50:19.282 --> 00:50:20.417
GETTING BETTER OF THESE

00:50:20.484 --> 00:50:23.186
AGENCIES BEING FORCED TO OR A

00:50:23.253 --> 00:50:24.554
REWARDED IF THEY'LL BE COMING

00:50:24.621 --> 00:50:25.989
FORTH I MEAN THERE HAS TO BE AN

00:50:26.056 --> 00:50:27.257
ACCOUNTABILITY BECAUSE AGENCIES

00:50:27.324 --> 00:50:28.892
HISTORICALLY DON'T WANT TO JUST

00:50:28.959 --> 00:50:31.128
PUT STUFF OUT ON THE TABLE WE

00:50:31.194 --> 00:50:31.695
ALWAYS MAY NEED THAT FIFTEEN

00:50:31.762 --> 00:50:34.831
YEARS FROM NOW. SO THAT'S

00:50:34.898 --> 00:50:36.199
THAT'S KIND OF WHY THIS

00:50:36.266 --> 00:50:37.100
EXECUTIVE ORDER I THINK IS SO

00:50:37.167 --> 00:50:39.136
GROUND BREAKING INTO THE- THERE

00:50:39.202 --> 00:50:39.903
IS IT'S CALLED THE STATE

00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:41.004
PROPERTY INVENTORY EITHER THERE

00:50:41.071 --> 00:50:42.406
IS A AN ANNUAL REPORTING

00:50:42.472 --> 00:50:43.740
PROCESS THAT APARTMENTS ARE

00:50:43.807 --> 00:50:46.576
OBLIGATED TO FOLLOW TO REPORT.

00:50:46.643 --> 00:50:48.678
ALL EXISTING PROPERTY TO D. G.

00:50:48.745 --> 00:50:49.880
SB CAN. BE COMPILED INTO

00:50:49.946 --> 00:50:52.149
INVENTORY THERE ARE SOME

00:50:52.215 --> 00:50:53.450
EXEMPTIONS IN STATUTE FOR

00:50:53.517 --> 00:50:54.785
REPORTERS IN ME UP DATA BURIED

00:50:54.851 --> 00:50:56.686
A LITTLE BIT AND ALSO REPORTED

00:50:56.753 --> 00:50:57.888
SO THERE'S YOU KNOW SOME GAPS.

00:50:57.954 --> 00:50:58.688
WHICH IS WHY WE ACTUALLY TO

00:50:58.755 --> 00:51:00.457
COUNTY ASSESSOR DATA AS OPPOSED

00:51:00.524 --> 00:51:01.491
TO RELYING TO IT BECAUSE WE

00:51:01.558 --> 00:51:02.826
KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN GAP

00:51:02.893 --> 00:51:03.393
HISTORICALLY WE EVEN LEAVE

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:04.961
ANYTHING OUT. BUT AT THAT

00:51:05.028 --> 00:51:06.263
PROCESS DOES EXIST AND THAT'S

00:51:06.329 --> 00:51:08.131
WHERE DEPARTMENTS ARE OBLIGATED

00:51:08.198 --> 00:51:09.433
TO REPORT ACCESS TO US BUT

00:51:09.499 --> 00:51:10.567
AGAIN WE GET YOU KNOW ONE TWO

00:51:10.634 --> 00:51:13.403
YEAR TYPE OF THING. AND SO THIS

00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:14.704
EXECUTIVE ORDER REQUIRES TO GO

00:51:14.771 --> 00:51:16.673
OUT AND SAY INDEPENDENT ALL

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:17.674
THAT REPORTING INDEPENDENT OF

00:51:17.741 --> 00:51:20.410
DEPARTMENT SELF SUPPORTING.

00:51:20.477 --> 00:51:21.478
LET'S ACTUALLY LOOK AT PROPERTY

00:51:21.545 --> 00:51:22.446
AND SEE WHAT'S OUT THERE AND

00:51:22.512 --> 00:51:23.814
WHAT APPEARS TO BE UNDER

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:26.316
UTILIZED SO. THIS IS CREATED AN

00:51:26.383 --> 00:51:31.721
ACCESS LIST. THAT WE WOULD

00:51:31.788 --> 00:51:32.289
NEVER HAVE ARRIVED AT HAD IT

00:51:32.355 --> 00:51:32.823
NOT BEEN FOR THE EXECUTIVE

00:51:32.889 --> 00:51:38.762
ORDER. THE NAME ISSUE THAT THE

00:51:38.829 --> 00:51:39.529
CHAIR HAS JUST BROUGHT TO OUR

00:51:39.596 --> 00:51:41.131
ATTENTION IS ALSO. OF MANIFEST

00:51:41.198 --> 00:51:41.698
IMPORTANCE AND IT GOES BACK

00:51:41.765 --> 00:51:45.268
MANY MANY YEARS. FOR EXAMPLE

00:51:45.335 --> 00:51:46.303
PEOPLE WANT TO MOVE OUT INTO

00:51:46.369 --> 00:51:46.870
THE MORE RURAL AREAS FOR THE

00:51:46.937 --> 00:51:50.440
AESTHETICS. THE BEAUTY OF IT.

00:51:50.507 --> 00:51:51.074
BUT THEN WHEN WE TRY TO SECURE

00:51:51.141 --> 00:51:54.044
FARM WORKER HOUSING. THEN HE'S

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:58.582

00:52:00.183 --> 00:52:00.717
TECHNIQUES TO DEAL WITH THOSE

00:52:00.784 --> 00:52:03.854
KIND OF LOCAL. NIMBY

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:05.522
IMPEDIMENTS THAT COME FORWARD

00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:06.122
HOW DO WE CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT

00:52:06.189 --> 00:52:07.724
HATE YOU KNOW. YOU'RE GOING TO

00:52:07.791 --> 00:52:10.894
HAVE TO TAKE YOUR SHARE. BUT

00:52:10.961 --> 00:52:12.362
WE'VE HAD ISSUES OF THAT

00:52:12.429 --> 00:52:13.363
RELATED TO THE AFFORDABLE

00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:17.200
HOUSING MANDATE. COMMUNITIES

TRYING TO WELL YOU KNOW NOT US

00:52:18.602 --> 00:52:22.372
NOW IT'S. THAT THAT'S THE

00:52:22.439 --> 00:52:24.708
THAT'S A HUGE PROBLEM AND IT'S

00:52:24.774 --> 00:52:25.242
GONNA HAVE TO BE WHEN YOU

00:52:28.845 --> 00:52:31.481
YEAH IT HONESTLY NOT TO START

00:52:31.548 --> 00:52:34.584
TO GO BACK TO A THEME BUT- WE

00:52:34.651 --> 00:52:35.886
MAY BLACKOUT NEVER SINGLE

00:52:35.952 --> 00:52:36.486
PARCELS IN A PLACE HER BODY

00:52:36.553 --> 00:52:37.587
WANTS TO DEVELOP WE MIGHT HAVE

00:52:37.654 --> 00:52:38.321
THE EXACT OPPOSITE THAT WE

00:52:38.388 --> 00:52:39.389
REALLY DON'T KNOW IN SOME

00:52:39.456 --> 00:52:42.826
CASES. BUT YEAH INSOFAR AS WE

00:52:42.893 --> 00:52:43.426
COME ACROSS THAT AND KIND OF

00:52:43.493 --> 00:52:45.595
BACK TO THE CHAIRS POINT IN IN

00:52:45.662 --> 00:52:49.499
MY ANSWER. WE DO HAVE.

00:52:49.566 --> 00:52:50.800
EXEMPTIONS BEING SOVEREIGN THAT

00:52:50.867 --> 00:52:51.635
WE DON'T HAVE TO GO QUITE

00:52:51.701 --> 00:52:52.903
THROUGH THE SAME A POOL

00:52:52.969 --> 00:52:54.571
PLANNING PROCESS. AGAIN WANT TO

00:52:54.638 --> 00:52:55.539

LOCAL PLANNING IN THOSE ISSUES

00:53:11.421 --> 00:53:13.423
SO. THOSE CAN BE LEVERAGED BUT

00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:15.559
AGAIN WE ARE LOOKING TO

00:53:15.625 --> 00:53:18.295
PRIORITIZE SITES WHERE. THAT

00:53:18.361 --> 00:53:20.297
THAT SYNERGY BETWEEN US AND

00:53:20.363 --> 00:53:22.232
LOCAL NEED AND WANT IS WELL

00:53:22.299 --> 00:53:23.633
ALIGNED. AND THEN WE CERTAINLY

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:24.601
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE WILL BE

00:53:24.668 --> 00:53:25.635
A GOOD BIT OF COMMUNITY OUT

ASSUMING THAT THERE. MIGHT BE

00:55:24.354 --> 00:55:24.754
HAPPEN TO LOOK AT SOME

00:55:24.821 --> 00:55:25.388

00:55:35.532 --> 00:55:37.233
A PRESENTATION AND THIS IS JUST

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:39.636
A TREMENDOUS UNDERTAKING I HAVE

00:55:39.703 --> 00:55:41.604
TO COMMEND ALL OF YOU ONE I GOT

00:55:41.671 --> 00:55:43.907
ELECTED TO CITY COUNCIL IN IN

00:55:43.973 --> 00:55:47.210
THE TWO THOUSAND SIX AND WE'RE

00:55:47.277 --> 00:55:47.777
GOING THROUGH A VERY SIMILAR

00:55:47.844 --> 00:55:50.380
HOUSING CRISIS BACK THEN WE HAD.

00:55:50.447 --> 00:55:50.880
ALSO SENSE OF URGENCY OF

00:55:50.947 --> 00:55:52.816
CREATING NEW STOCK AND- I DID

00:55:52.882 --> 00:55:53.850
SOMETHING SIMILAR WITH THE CITY

00:55:53.917 --> 00:55:56.252
OF SAN DIEGO OF IDENTIFYING

00:55:56.319 --> 00:55:58.588
UNUSED PARCELS AND FIND TRYING

00:55:58.655 --> 00:55:59.222
TO FIND WHICH ONES WERE HELPFUL

00:55:59.289 --> 00:56:02.425
AND WAS VERY INTERESTING. THAT

00:56:02.492 --> 00:56:02.992
THERE WAS A VERY LONG LIST O

00:56:03.059 --> 00:56:05.128
PROPERTY THAT CITY DID NOT EVEN

00:56:05.195 --> 00:56:11.267
HAVE AN INVENTORY. AND. THAT

00:56:11.334 --> 00:56:14.237
WAS A VERY TROUBLED DEPARTMENT

00:56:14.304 --> 00:56:14.938
RE REAL ESTATE ASSETS

00:56:15.004 --> 00:56:17.774
DEPARTMENT BECAUSE THEY HAD ALL

00:56:17.841 --> 00:56:18.408
THIS LAND THAT THEY DIDN'T EVEN

00:56:18.475 --> 00:56:21.711
KNOW. WHAT IT WAS AND WHERE IT

00:56:21.778 --> 00:56:23.613
WAS AND IT TOOK A TREMENDOUS

00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:25.115
AMOUNT OF TIME TO IDENTIFY WHAT

00:56:25.181 --> 00:56:25.715
THOSE PARCELS WARNER MAKES ME

00:56:25.782 --> 00:56:28.818
THINK. IN OF THAT'S THAT THE

00:56:28.885 --> 00:56:30.787
STATE HAS THAT IN THE COUNTIES

00:56:30.854 --> 00:56:32.188
HAVE THAT IN CITIES HOW MUCH

00:56:32.255 --> 00:56:33.857
LAND IS PUBLICLY ON. THERE'S

00:56:33.923 --> 00:56:35.525
BEEN FORGOTTEN. THAT SITTING

00:56:35.592 --> 00:56:39.062
OUT THERE NOT ACHIEVING OF

00:56:39.129 --> 00:56:41.431
BENEFIT TO THESE COMMUNITIES I

00:56:41.498 --> 00:56:41.998
CAN BE UTILIZED. I'M NOT I'M

00:56:42.065 --> 00:56:45.969
NOT A I'M NOT. AT IN ANY CASE

00:56:46.035 --> 00:56:46.536
THINK IN THAT YOU SHOULD GO

00:56:46.603 --> 00:56:49.939
AFTER THAT BECAUSE. BUT YOU

00:56:50.006 --> 00:56:51.674
KNOW KIND OF BEGS THE QUESTION

00:56:51.741 --> 00:56:53.443
OF THESE LATENT ASSETS THEY'RE

00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:55.411
NOT PAYING A PROPERTY TAX

00:56:55.478 --> 00:56:57.247
WHAT'S THE VALUE TO OUR STATE.

00:56:57.313 --> 00:56:59.682
OF PUTTING THESE ASSETS BACK TO

00:56:59.749 --> 00:57:00.250
WORK EVEN IF WE WERE TO SELL

00:57:00.316 --> 00:57:03.019
THEM IF THEY'RE NOT. ARE THERE

00:57:03.086 --> 00:57:04.287
SOME VALUE IN AN AND LOOKING IN

00:57:04.354 --> 00:57:04.854
THAT BECAUSE THAT COULD VERY

00:57:04.921 --> 00:57:08.925
MUCH PAY. FOR THIS DEVELOPMENT.

00:57:08.992 --> 00:57:10.660
AND ALSO BRING ADDITIONAL

00:57:10.727 --> 00:57:12.428
REVENUE TO THE STATE FOR FUTURE

00:57:12.495 --> 00:57:13.963
YEARS A SOMETHING I THINK WE

00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:14.597
SHOULD LOOK AT THAT FOURTY FOUR

00:57:14.664 --> 00:57:16.733
THOUSAND PARCELS THAT'S- THAT'S

00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:18.868
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF LAND YOU

00:57:18.935 --> 00:57:20.303
KNOW EVEN IF I UNDERSTAND SOME

00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:22.338
OF THESE ARE REMNANTS OF OTHER

00:57:22.405 --> 00:57:23.072
PARCELS THAT WERE USED FOR ON

00:57:23.139 --> 00:57:26.042
RAMPS FOR FREE WAY. OR OR FOR

00:57:26.109 --> 00:57:27.277
YOU KNOW THIS THIRD THERE'S

00:57:27.343 --> 00:57:29.245
GOTTA BE A WAY TO IDENTIFY THE

00:57:29.312 --> 00:57:30.947
ONES ARE USABLE IT. AND IF

00:57:31.014 --> 00:57:33.082
THEY'RE NOT NESTLE USABLE FOR

00:57:33.149 --> 00:57:33.716
HOUSING THAT COULD BE USED FOR

00:57:33.783 --> 00:57:36.419
AGRICULTURE OR SOMETHING ELSE

00:57:36.486 --> 00:57:41.124
OR TO HELP. FINALIZE A PARTIAL

00:57:41.191 --> 00:57:42.692
THAT WOULD BE USED TO BRING

00:57:42.759 --> 00:57:43.660
REVENUE TO THE STATE TO ALSO

00:57:43.726 --> 00:57:44.360
HELP WITH PAYING THE COSTS OF

00:57:44.427 --> 00:57:46.162
SUPPORTING THIS HOUSING SO THAT

00:57:46.229 --> 00:57:48.064
MAY BE KIND OF THE NEXT STEP IN

00:57:48.131 --> 00:57:48.665
THIS PROCESS OF. IF WE WANT TO

00:57:48.731 --> 00:57:53.136
DO THAT BUT- GENERALLY. I

00:57:53.203 --> 00:57:55.238
RECOMMEND THAT AS WE GO THROUGH

00:57:55.305 --> 00:57:57.407
THIS PROCESS THAT WE ESTABLISH

00:57:57.473 --> 00:58:02.212
SOME KIND OF. AS A RESOLUTION

00:58:02.278 --> 00:58:04.247
OR AN ACTUAL BILL A LAW KIND OF

00:58:04.314 --> 00:58:07.050
ESTABLISHING THE URGENCY AT A

00:58:07.116 --> 00:58:09.719
CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA SOMETHING

00:58:09.786 --> 00:58:12.989
THAT ACCOMPANIES THIS ACTION TO

00:58:13.056 --> 00:58:15.825
TRUMP ALL OTHER. LAWS IN TERMS

00:58:15.892 --> 00:58:19.195
OF THE NECESSITY AND THE

00:58:19.262 --> 00:58:19.796
URGENCY TO ADD TO THE HOUSING

00:58:19.863 --> 00:58:24.334

HELP TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS

00:58:27.737 --> 00:58:28.204
OF GETTING THESE PROJECTS

00:58:28.271 --> 00:58:30.874
APPROVED. I DO RECOMMEND

WORKING LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO

00:58:33.042 --> 00:58:35.111

COMMUNITY PLANS THAT THEY'RE

00:58:44.888 --> 00:58:47.323
CONSISTENT WITH THE ZONING IN

00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:49.692
THE AREA THAT THE DESIGN IS

00:58:49.759 --> 00:58:52.262
CONSISTENT WITH WOULD LOCAL.

00:58:52.328 --> 00:58:55.164
CODES I THINK THAT CAN BE DONE

00:58:55.231 --> 00:58:56.366
IT IN A WAY THAT WOULD HELP

00:58:56.432 --> 00:59:00.670
MAKE THESE. PROJECTS UP QUICKLY

00:59:00.737 --> 00:59:02.872
BUILDABLE BUT ALSO SUSTAINABLE

00:59:02.939 --> 00:59:04.774
OVER SEVERAL YEARS IT'S IS VERY

00:59:04.841 --> 00:59:05.909
IMPORTANT TO DO THAT TO MAKE

00:59:05.975 --> 00:59:08.845
SURE WE SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITIES

00:59:08.912 --> 00:59:10.280
AS WE BUILD THIS NEST NECESSARY

00:59:10.346 --> 00:59:12.282
HOUSING. AND THE NEXT THING AS

00:59:12.348 --> 00:59:15.118
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT. MAKING

00:59:15.184 --> 00:59:16.986
SURE THAT WE GIVE THE

00:59:17.053 --> 00:59:19.088
DEVELOPERS THE DISCRETION TO

00:59:19.155 --> 00:59:20.390
COME UP WITH A BUSINESS PLAN

00:59:20.456 --> 00:59:22.659
THAT FITS. YOU KNOW THE PARTS

00:59:22.725 --> 00:59:23.226
ON THE LOCATION I THINK THAT

00:59:23.293 --> 00:59:25.895
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. BUT WE

00:59:25.962 --> 00:59:27.096
ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:59:27.163 --> 00:59:28.264
WE'RE BUILDING A WORKFORCE

00:59:28.331 --> 00:59:29.766
HOUSE IN THAT WERE BUILDING

00:59:29.832 --> 00:59:31.100
HOUSING FOR THE PEOPLE OF

00:59:31.167 --> 00:59:33.169
CALIFORNIA THAT THIS HOUSE IT'S

00:59:33.236 --> 00:59:34.470
NOT GOING TO BE USED. AS A

00:59:34.537 --> 00:59:36.906
VACATION HOME MORE AIRBNB. WE

00:59:36.973 --> 00:59:38.408
GOT TO FIND A WAY TO ENSURE

BUILT TO ALLEVIATE THE HOUSING

00:59:43.813 --> 00:59:46.382
CRISIS. AND NOT FOR ANYTHING

00:59:46.449 --> 00:59:47.884
OTHER THAN THAT AND THAT I

00:59:47.951 --> 00:59:50.720
THINK HAS TO BE CLEAR IN THIS

00:59:50.787 --> 00:59:51.321
PROCESS TO WHOEVER. INTENDS TO

00:59:51.387 --> 00:59:53.923
DEVELOP. PROVIDING THE SUPPLY

00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:58.761
IS CRITICAL. AND IT BUT IT'S

00:59:58.828 --> 01:00:01.130

01:00:01.197 --> 01:00:02.966
HOUSING FOR PEOPLE LIVE IT AND

01:00:03.032 --> 01:00:04.534

WE HAVE TO. ENSURE THAT WE DO.

01:00:08.338 --> 01:00:09.572
OTHER THAN THAT I AGREE WITH

EVERYTHING YOU SAID THOSE WITH

01:00:11.741 --> 01:00:12.075
THESE ARE JUST MY

01:00:12.141 --> 01:00:14.677
RECOMMENDATIONS BECAUSE. YOU

01:00:14.744 --> 01:00:15.845
KNOW I WAS INVOLVED IN

01:00:15.912 --> 01:00:16.913
INTRODUCING A YOU KNOW

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:18.314
THOUSANDS OF UNITS INTO SAN

01:00:18.381 --> 01:00:19.949
DIEGO WE TO A COMBINATION OF

01:00:20.016 --> 01:00:22.218
CONDO CONVERSIONS WE DID. NEW

01:00:22.285 --> 01:00:24.587
HOUSE IN WE DID MARKET RATE I

01:00:24.654 --> 01:00:26.689
THINK THROUGH THIS PROCESS.

01:00:26.756 --> 01:00:29.959
WE'VE WE'VE GOT OF. THERE'S

01:00:30.026 --> 01:00:31.160
GOTTA THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME

01:00:31.227 --> 01:00:33.463
DISCRETION GIVEN TO YOU TO

01:00:33.529 --> 01:00:34.630
ALLOW TO WORK WITH THE

01:00:34.697 --> 01:00:35.598
DEVELOPMENT SEEMS TO COME UP

01:00:35.665 --> 01:00:37.433
WITH A MIX. A HEALTHY MIX OF

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:41.471
HOUSING AGAIN. IF YOU CREATE

01:00:41.537 --> 01:00:42.405
SUPPLY I WILL CRITICIZE BUT IF

01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:44.707
THERE'S SOME WAY TO. GUIDE THIS

01:00:44.774 --> 01:00:46.376
PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE

01:00:46.442 --> 01:00:47.610
CREATING AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

01:00:47.677 --> 01:00:49.345
THERE REALLY ARE WITH THAT WE

01:00:49.412 --> 01:00:50.980
ARE CREATING A COMBINATION OF

01:00:51.047 --> 01:00:52.982
MAYBE. APARTMENTS WITH MAYBE

01:00:53.049 --> 01:00:56.185
SOME FOR OWNERSHIP. AND BRING

01:00:56.252 --> 01:00:56.719
IN MORE OWNERSHIP IN THE

01:00:56.786 --> 01:00:58.554
COMMUNITY IF THERE'S A WAY TO

01:00:58.621 --> 01:00:59.689
DO THAT I THINK THAT WOULD BE

01:00:59.756 --> 01:01:00.757
IDEAL AND I THINK WITH THAT

01:01:00.823 --> 01:01:02.225
WOULD. CREATE MORE BY AN- FROM

01:01:02.291 --> 01:01:04.394
FROM THE PEOPLE OF OUR

01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:08.498
COMMUNITY AND. THE LAST THING I

01:01:08.564 --> 01:01:11.334
WANT TO SAY IS SAN DIEGO WE'RE

01:01:11.401 --> 01:01:12.435
TRYING TO REBUILD OUR OUR CITY

01:01:12.502 --> 01:01:15.104
HALLAND IN SOME CASES THERE'S

01:01:15.171 --> 01:01:15.938
NO LAND IN SOME CASES VERY.

01:01:16.005 --> 01:01:19.942
EXPENSIVE. AND IF THERE'S WAYS

01:01:20.009 --> 01:01:21.677
TO PARTNER WITH LOCAL SINCE

01:01:21.744 --> 01:01:23.679

01:01:23.746 --> 01:01:25.481
AREAS WHERE WE HAVE A STATE

01:01:25.548 --> 01:01:28.818
BUILDING THAT IS UNDER UTILIZED.

01:01:28.885 --> 01:01:31.621
HAVE WE LOOKED AT EXISTING

01:01:31.687 --> 01:01:33.790
FACILITIES ARE UNDER UTILIZED

01:01:33.856 --> 01:01:35.425
FOR MAYBE A POTENTIAL REDUCE

01:01:35.491 --> 01:01:37.860
MAYBE THAT IS THE SECOND PHASE.

01:01:37.927 --> 01:01:40.129
GOING INTO NEXT YEAR AS YOU GO

01:01:40.196 --> 01:01:40.630
THROUGH THIS PROCESS BUT

01:01:40.696 --> 01:01:43.466
THERE'S VALUE IN THAT BECAUSE.

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:45.168
IN MY COMMUNITY THERE ARE SOME

01:01:45.234 --> 01:01:46.469
STATE BUILDINGS ARE BEING

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:47.637

01:01:49.472 --> 01:01:50.740
BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY BUT

01:01:50.807 --> 01:01:52.175
THEY'RE UNDER UTILIZED AND THEY

01:01:52.241 --> 01:01:53.876
COULD BE ADDED TO AND THEY

01:01:53.943 --> 01:01:55.912
COULD BE COMBINED WITH OTHER

01:01:55.978 --> 01:01:56.479
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND OTHER

01:01:56.546 --> 01:02:00.450

SURPLUS LAND FOR AFFORDABLE

01:18:31.673 --> 01:18:33.241
HOUSING IS A CRITICAL PART OF

01:18:33.308 --> 01:18:34.709
THE SOLUTION TOWARDS BUILDING A

01:18:34.776 --> 01:18:36.611

TEN MOST EXPENSIVE. AND SO WHEN

01:18:57.099 --> 01:18:58.433
WE LOOK AT SOLUTIONS THAT CAN

01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:01.269
TURN UNUSED AND UNDER UTILIZED

01:19:01.336 --> 01:19:03.338

TO BE VERY SUPPORTIVE.

01:19:08.944 --> 01:19:11.513
GENERALLY THE PROBLEM IS THAT

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:13.849
WE DON'T KNOW AND UP UNTIL THE

01:19:13.915 --> 01:19:15.584
SIX SECOND OF ORDER WE DIDN'T

01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:18.286
KNOW WHERE THAT LAND WISE. AND

01:19:18.353 --> 01:19:19.821
EVEN IF THE SITES WERE KNOWN IT

01:19:19.888 --> 01:19:21.423
WAS DIFFICULT AND IT IS

01:19:21.490 --> 01:19:22.457
DIFFICULT AND GENERAL TO

01:19:22.524 --> 01:19:23.692
DETERMINE WHETHER THOSE SITES

01:19:23.758 --> 01:19:24.960

STATEMENT WE HAVE AN

01:24:42.644 --> 01:24:44.012
AGRICULTURAL PRESERVE IN NAPA

01:24:44.078 --> 01:24:48.116
COUNTY HI WHICH IS A CRITICAL

01:24:48.183 --> 01:24:51.052
COMPONENT OF OUR ENTIRE REGION.

01:24:51.119 --> 01:24:52.420
ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I HAVE

01:24:52.487 --> 01:24:54.522
WORKED SO DILIGENTLY WITH THE

01:24:54.589 --> 01:24:56.191
STATE AGENCIES RELATED TO THE

01:24:56.257 --> 01:24:58.960
VETERANS HOME IT IS LITERALLY

01:24:59.027 --> 01:25:02.363
THE ONLY LARGE PARCEL THAT IS

01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:06.034
VIABLE. IT DOES NOT. NEGATIVELY

01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:07.635
IMPACT OUR AGRICULTURAL LANDS

01:25:07.702 --> 01:25:08.670
SO WE HAVE A VERY UNIQUE

01:25:08.736 --> 01:25:11.206
OPPORTUNITY AND NAPA COUNTY I'M

01:25:11.272 --> 01:25:13.107
SURE THERE ARE OTHER CITIES

01:25:13.174 --> 01:25:14.676
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE

01:25:14.742 --> 01:25:16.678
SIMILAR SETS OF CIRCUMSTANCES

01:25:16.744 --> 01:25:19.180
THAT. THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE

01:25:19.247 --> 01:25:22.517
VIABLE AG LAND CONVERTED TO

01:25:22.584 --> 01:25:25.787
HOUSING IF IT IS AFFORDABLE SO

01:25:25.854 --> 01:25:27.288
WE ARE TRYING TO FIND ALL THE

01:25:27.355 --> 01:25:30.558
OPPORTUNITIES ARE SHORT OF THAT

01:25:30.625 --> 01:25:31.159
TO BRING THE HOUSING NEEDS TO

01:25:31.226 --> 01:25:34.729
OUR OUR COUNTY. JUST AT THAT

01:25:34.796 --> 01:25:36.631
TYPICALLY THOSE TYPES OF PLANTS

01:25:36.698 --> 01:25:37.665
THEY DON'T EVEN MAKE IT ONTO

01:25:37.732 --> 01:25:41.002
THE LIST BECAUSE FOR WHAT WE

01:25:41.069 --> 01:25:41.903
WERE TALKING ABOUT AS FAR

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:43.671
SURPLUS PUBLIC LANDS IT NEEDS

01:25:43.738 --> 01:25:46.307
TO BE IDENTIFIED AS SURPLUS NO

01:25:46.374 --> 01:25:48.610
LONGER NEEDED FOR. WHATEVER USE

01:25:48.676 --> 01:25:50.211
THAT WAS PURCHASED FOR

01:25:50.278 --> 01:25:52.180
AGRICULTURAL LANDS TEND TO BE A

01:25:52.247 --> 01:25:53.982
PROTECTED USE AND THAT'S NOT

01:25:54.048 --> 01:25:56.951

01:32:21.903 --> 01:32:22.770
I WOULD ADD TO DAVID'S

01:32:22.837 --> 01:32:25.706
EXCELLENT TESTIMONY IS THAT.

01:32:25.773 --> 01:32:26.741
THE STATE ALREADY DOES

01:32:26.807 --> 01:32:29.644
PRIORITIZE AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:32:29.710 --> 01:32:31.612
FOR CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF

01:32:31.679 --> 01:32:33.547
PROFESSIONS SO FOR INSTANCE

01:32:33.614 --> 01:32:34.715
BUILDING TEACHER HOUSING OR

01:32:34.782 --> 01:32:36.751
FARM WORKER HOUSING YOU CAN

01:32:36.817 --> 01:32:39.020
BUILD ON SCHOOL PROPERTY FOR

01:32:39.086 --> 01:32:40.288
INSTANCE IF YOU HAVE A SCHOOL

01:32:40.354 --> 01:32:42.924
DISTRICT YOU NEED TO EDUCATOR

01:32:42.990 --> 01:32:43.424
YOU NEED TO HOUSE YOUR

01:32:43.491 --> 01:32:46.060
EDUCATORS AND YOUR STAFF AND IF

01:32:46.127 --> 01:32:47.662
THE SCHOOL DISTRICT USES TO DO

01:32:47.728 --> 01:32:50.131
THAT. YOU CAN DO THE HOUSING

01:32:50.197 --> 01:32:53.200
TARGETED TO THAT SEGMENT YOU

01:32:53.267 --> 01:32:54.702
CAN ALSO TARGET VETERANS AND

01:32:54.769 --> 01:32:56.103
YOU CAN ALSO TARGET FARMWORKERS

01:32:56.170 --> 01:32:58.272
AND SO THERE IS PRECEDENT IN

01:32:58.339 --> 01:33:00.641
STATE LAW THAT ALLOWS FOR THAT

01:33:00.708 --> 01:33:03.611
TARGETING. BUT IT I GUESS MORE

01:33:03.678 --> 01:33:05.513

01:33:05.579 --> 01:33:06.213
OF THE ABOVE APPROACHES AND

01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:07.848
ACTUALLY THE COUNTY OF NAPA HAS

01:33:07.915 --> 01:33:09.283

01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:11.485
FORCE HOUSING PROXIMITY PROGRAM

01:33:11.552 --> 01:33:12.853
THAT KEEPS DOWN PAYMENT

01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:14.956
ASSISTANCE FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVE

01:33:15.022 --> 01:33:17.124

THEIR JOBS AND WORK IN NAPA AND

01:33:19.694 --> 01:33:23.931

WHAT'S HAPPENED IS WE'RE SEEING

01:33:43.150 --> 01:33:44.051
THROUGHOUT THE STATUS THERE'S

01:33:44.118 --> 01:33:47.021

01:33:47.088 --> 01:33:49.690
BECOME A CUTE SO THAT WE'RE

01:33:49.757 --> 01:33:50.591
SEEING BUSINESSES CLOSE WE'RE

01:33:50.658 --> 01:33:52.059
SEEING SCHOOLS CLOSE. WE'RE

01:33:52.126 --> 01:33:53.227
WE'RE SEEING THE REAL IMPACTS

01:33:53.294 --> 01:33:55.563
AND UNFORTUNATELY IT HAS TAKEN

01:33:55.629 --> 01:33:56.797
SOME PERIOD OF TIME. BEFORE ALL

01:33:56.864 --> 01:33:58.099
INDUSTRIES AND ALL LEVELS OF

01:33:58.165 --> 01:33:59.266

01:34:02.670 --> 01:34:06.640
IS A CRITICAL PRIORITY. NOT

01:34:06.707 --> 01:34:08.409
JUST A NAPA COUNTY BY USING MY

01:34:08.476 --> 01:34:09.944
EXAMPLE I REACH OUT OF THE WORK

01:34:22.089 --> 01:34:25.092
SOLUTION THAT'S WHAT WE REALLY

01:34:25.159 --> 01:34:26.761
