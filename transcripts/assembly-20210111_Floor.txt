I RISE TODAY TO ASK YOU TO JOIN ME IN REPUDIATING THE VIOLENCE THAT OCCURRED LAST WEEK IN OUR NATION'S CAPITAL. THE DESECRATION OF DEMOCRACY. THE DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY. AND SADLY THE LOSS OF LIFE FOR ALMOST TOO MUCH TO COMPREHEND. WHY ALL BECAUSE OF THE BIG LIE. THE PRESIDENT'S NONSTOP UNSUBSTANTIATED AND FALSE CLAIMS THAT THE ELECTION WAS RIGGED AND FRAUDULENTLY STOLEN FROM HIM WITH THE SPARKS THAT LIT THE FIRE IT IS NOW INVOLVED OUR NATION. WE HAVE COLLEAGUES THAT TOOK TO SOCIAL MEDIA TO DEFLECT BLAME. BUT THE IMAGES A CONFEDERATE FLAGS MAGGA HATS AND UBIQUITOUS Q. ANON SYMBOL LEAVES NO DOUBT WHOSE MOB IT WAS. EACH DAY MORE AND MORE VIDEO FOOTAGE REVEALS A VERY DARK PICTURE. FROM THE MURDEROUS CHANCE CONSTRUCTING A GALLOWS COMPLETE WITH NOOSE. TO ZIP TIES PIPE BOMBS AND GUNS AND WORSE. WATCHING A POLICE OFFICER BEING BEATEN WITH AN AMERICAN FLAG POLE. A POLICE OFFICER BEATEN WITH AN AMERICAN FLAG POLE. IT'S CLEAR THAT THE MOB HAD BEEN CITED BY THE BIG LIE. WELL AS EASY TO DEMONISE THOSE CAUGHT UP IN THE FRENZY OF HATE AND ANGER. THIS AMERICAN CARNAGE LAYS AT THE FEET. OF ONLY ONE PERSON. MANY OF US IN THIS CHAMBER. I UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S LIKE TO COME FROM A MARGINALIZED COMMUNITY BELIEVE ME. BEING POOR AND WHITE FROM THE DESERT. CARRIES MANY OF THE SAME BURDENS AS GROWING UP POOR AND BLACK OR BROWN FROM THE CITY. I UNDERSTAND THOSE WHO FEEL THAT THEY'VE BEEN LEFT BEHIND. I HAVE FAMILY AND FRIENDS WHO THINK THAT NO ONE IS LISTENING TO THEM IN THEIR FEARS THAT THEY'RE LOSING THE COUNTRY. THAT THEY LOVE. LET ME BE CLEAR. THOSE WHO ARE COMMITTED WHO COMMITTED THIS INSURRECTION MUST BE PUNISHED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW. BUT WE MUST SHOW UNDERSTANDING FOR THOSE RADICALIZED BY SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS BY NARCISSISTIC POLITICIANS AND SHOCK JOCK GRIFTERS HAVE GOTTEN RICH OFF OF EXPLOITING PEOPLE'S EMOTIONS AND FEARS. WE MUST SHOW THEM LOVE AND ASK THEM TO COME HOME TO AMERICA BUT HERE'S THEIR VOICES. YES I'M SAYING THAT WE NEED RECONCILIATION AND HEALING. BUT THAT COMES AFTER ACCOUNTABILITY AND REPENTANCE. WE CAN BEGIN THAT PROCESS TODAY BY STANDING UNITED IN THE DEFENSE OF FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY AND ANNOUNCING THE BIG LIE. AMERICA IS EXCEPTIONAL AND I BELIEVE THAT. OUR LOVE OF LIBERTY IS WHAT SETS US APART FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD. BUT LIBERTY CANNOT INDOOR WITHOUT RESPONSIBILITY. MANY OF US WOULD PREFERRED THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD TAKE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND RESIGN ON HIS OWN VOLITION. SINCE HE FAILED TO DO SO THE PEOPLE AND THE REPRESENTATIVES MUST HOLD HIM RESPONSIBLE WITH THE TOOLS OF THE CONSTITUTION PROVIDES. THE PRESIDENT INVITED THE INSURRECTIONIST HE INCITED THEM AND FOR TOO LONG HE DID NOTHING TO STOP THEM. MEMBERS IF THAT IS NOT AN IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE BUT I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT IS. THE WITHIN EACH OF US TOOK WEEKS AGO TO SUPPORT DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES US TO TAKE ACTION SO TODAY. LET US RAISE OUR VOICE AND ACT IN SOLIDARITY AS ONE NATION TO HOLD THE PRESIDENT TO ACCOUNT. MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE AND ASKED BY LIKE THE CLERK TO OPEN THE ROLE FOR CO AUTHORS. THANK YOU MISTER MESS. SEE NO DISCUSSION DEBATE. MISTER GIBSON IN THE REAR OF THE CHAMBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR SPEAKER ANDMEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SUPPORT FOR HR SEVEN. AS A PRINCIPLE CALLED. I'M ASKING FOR THE IMMEDIATE REMOVAL OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP MY RESIGNATION ORDERED ACTING. THE TWENTY FIFTH AMENDMENT OR IMPEACHMENT OR CONVICTION. MEMBERS WHAT WE ALL SAW LAST WEDNESDAY WAS A DIRECT ASSAULT ON THE DEMOCRACY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I'M ABSOLUTELY BELIEVING THAT OUR VOICE IN CALIFORNIA BY IN SUPPORT OF HR SEVEN CAN CERTAINLY SAID ALLOW MESSAGE A STRONG MESSAGE. THAT THIS WHAT TRANSPIRED ON WEDNESDAY. WE'RE FIX PEOPLE'S LIVES WERE LOST. INCLUDING A CAPITOL POLICE OFFICER. INDIVIDUAL WHO SWORE TO PROTECT WAS A VICTIM OF WHAT TRANSPIRED. THAT EMULATED FROM THE HIGHEST OFFICE OF THIS LAND. IT WAS GREEN LIGHTED. FOR PEOPLE TO COME TOGETHER. AN ATTACK. ARE YOU NOT A STATE CAPITOL. WE CAN DISAGREE WE CAN BE ABLE TO HELP PARTY LINES DEMOCRATS REPUBLICANS. BUT WHAT TRANSPIRED. I SAT IN HORROR. BUT OUR NATION CAPITAL WAS UNDER ATTACK BECAUSE BIG CHEAP COMMANDING OFFICER GAVE THE GREEN LIGHT. VIGILANTE. TO ATTACK OUR DEMOCRACY. TO PUT PEOPLE'S LIVES IN JEOPARDY. WE CANNOT STAND BY AND WATCH THIS HAPPEN. WE BELIEVE STRONGLY. IN H. R. SEVEN AND WE THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS RESOLUTION BEFORE THIS BODY CALIFORNIA COULD NOT BE SILENT. DR BURGER KING SAYS THAT SILENCE IS A FORMER TRAIL WE HAVE THE POWER TO COLLECTIVELY BILLION ALL BOYS TOGETHER ON THIS FLOOR AND A LOUD MESSAGE. THAT WE WILL NOT STAND FOR NOT ONLY ATTACK AGAINST OUR DEMOCRACY. BUT THIS COUNTRY IT HAS LEFT THIS COUNTRY VULNERABLE THE OTHER TAX OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THIS RESOLUTION TO SEND A STRONG MESSAGE THAT THIS PRESIDENT NEEDS TO RESIGN. THIS PRESIDENT NEEDS OR THE VICE PRESIDENT OF BOTH THE TWENTY FIFTH AMENDMENT. I DO THE RIGHT THING IT IS TIME FOR THIS COUNTRY T. HILL AND THIS COUNTRY NEEDS ZERO NOW. STOP ASKING THAT YOU SUPPORT HR SEVEN WHICH I ABLE THANK YOU MEMBERS. EGGMAN GIPSON MISTER MATHIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. MEMBERS I LIKE- MY COLLEAGUE IS INTRODUCING THIS RESOLUTION. GREW UP. WHY IS WELL. IT IS SEEN THE FACE OF POVERTY IS LIVE THE FACE OF POVERTY AND UNDERSTANDS WHAT IT'S LIKE. TO GROW UP IN ONE OF THE AREAS THAT'S FOR GOTTEN. BY THE POLITICIANS THAT REPRESENT US. IS THE FIRST MILLENNIAL COMBAT VETERAN WITH A PURPLE HEART ELECTED TO STATE OFFICE IN THIS COUNTRY. I FIND WHAT HAPPENED. OUR NATIONAL CAPITAL COMPLETELY APPALLING. I TWEETED ABOUT IT SAYING THAT VIOLENCE IS NOT PROTEST. AND I AGREE WITH MANY OF THE THINGS THE AUTHOR IS SET. WHAT I DO NOT AGREE WITH. IS THE FACT THAT THE TWENTY FIFTH AMENDMENT TIMELINE SIMPLY IS NOT THERE. REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY OF ALL OF US WISH IT WAS. WE HAVE A LAME DUCK PRESIDENT. WE HAVE PEOPLE DYING OF COVERT. WE HAE AREAS IN OUR STATE. WHERE FAMILY STILL CAN'T PUT FOOD ON THEIR TABLE. WE HAVE PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT I STILL LIVE IN THIRD WORLD CONDITIONS AND DON'T HAVE RUNNING WATER. BUT INSTEAD THE FIRST THING WE DO ON THE FLOOR IN CALIFORNIA. IS THERE A POLITICAL PUNCH AT A LAME DUCK. I THINK THAT'S TO BLAME I THINK THE FIRST THING WE SHOULD BE DOING IS HELPING FAMILIES. WITH COLBY. LOOKING TO GET OUR KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL GETTING THIS VACCINE NOW. GOOD WE HAVE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO STILL SITTING IN BOXES. WE ARE FRONT LINE WORKERS THAT NEED THE VACCINE BUT NO WE'RE GOING TO SPEND MILLIONS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS YOUR DAHLE A CITIES. TO GO PARTIAL LANE. THIS IS A LIGHT YOUR OLD THAN THIS. I BELIEVE IN PUTTING OVER. AND THIS IS PAUL OVER PEOPLE LAST FOR NO. MR COOLEY YOUR RECOGNITION OR CHAMBER. CALLING I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. I THINK WHAT WE SAW LAST WEEK WAS A POLLING. I DO HOWEVER BELIEVE THIS IS A VERY APPROPRIATE TIME FOR COURSE LIKE THIS TO COME BEFORE THE MEMBERS OF THIS BODY. IT'S A TIME TO REFLECT UPON THE NATURE OF THE OFFICE WE SUITED. YES THE RESOLUTION IS A MIRROR. LET'S JUST LOOK AT RECENT CIRCUMSTANCES LAST WEEK CONDUCTED UP TO IT. BUT I ACTUALLY FEEL THAT THIS RESOLUTION IS A MIRROR IN YOUR OWN HEARTS WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE OFFICE THAT WE STANDING. AND SINCE THIS IS THE FIRST DAY OF TWENTY. TWENTY ONE AS WE START THE LEGISLATURE. I ACTUALLY STAND A PAIR WE DON'T HAVE OUR KIDS AT SCHOOL MY GRANDKIDS ARE NOT SCHOOL AHEAD OF. MAKES PERCENT. BUT I REMEMBER THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL. WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ON THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL MY FIRST DAY IN JOB. HOW I KNOW. THE FUTURE THE PROCESS. THAT OFFERS. THIS IS THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL FOR US TO COME BACK INTO TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AFTER TWO HOLD LAST YEAR. AND SET OUR SIGHTS HIGH. I DO AGREE WITH MY- THAT WE HAVE A BROAD AGENDA THE NEEDS TO BE A- TO THE- BENEFIT OF EVERY CALIFORNIA. ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. I AGREE WITH THAT. BUT YOU KNOW LITTLE OVER A MONTH AGO WE STOOD IN THE- HOLD ONE CENTER. WE LIVED IN OUR ARMS WHAT WE SAY. THANK ABOUT THOSE WORDS. YOU MADE A NOTE WE ALL MADE A NOTE. I DO SOLEMNLY SWEAR THIS IS NOT DONE LIGHT HEARTEDLY. THAT I WILL SUPPORT AND DEFEND. WHAT WHAT IS IT WILL TAKE A LITTLE TO SUPPORT AND DEFEND BUT THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES. AND THE POSSIBLE USES DATA CALIFORNIA. THAT I WILL BEAR TRUE FAITH AND ALLEGIANCE. THIS MEANS THERE IS A CONSTANCY TO THE FAITH ALLEGIANCE IS NOT LIKE WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID I PLAYED TAG I DO ACCESS OR NOT I WILL BE CONSIST. TRUTH FOR AND ALLEGIANCE TO COST I STAY CONSISTED OF CAL. THE I TAKE THIS ALL THE FREE WITHOUT ANY MENTAL RESERVATION OR PURPOSE EVASION. THAT WILL. WELL OF BASICALLY DESTROY THE DUTIES BY TERM NOT THERE THAT WAS RO. WE ALL TOOK THE OR WHAT THAT WE TOOK OURSELVES OUT OF. REGULAR LIFE. IN A POSITION OF TRUST AND SERVICE AND DEREK IS A BEYOND OURSELVES. THIS IS THE AMERICAN WAY IT IS THE MARK TO GIVE A WAY. AGES AGO IN THE MEAT TIME WE HAVE A COLD THAT WAS COMMON OF. YOUR TO GOING TO BE LOYAL TO YOU'RE DON'T WHAT WHAT YOU GIRLS WAS. THE IS NOT THE AMERICA WAY. THAT IS WHAT WE CAN OUR FUTURE ON OWES OF FIELD YOU. BUT IT IS ON THE OLD TO SOME THE TO WHICH I'VE IS UP. IN THIS RED. FARAS WHEN WE HOLD THAT MIRROR TO A. THE SIX GEORGE ORWELL WROTE AN ESSAY. THE GREW OUT OF HIS LIFE IN INDIA. WHERE ONE MORNING. PEOPLE OF HIS VILLAGE CAME TO HIM SAYING SOMETHING DISTRESSING IT HAPPENED. AND HE NEEDED ACT INSTANTLY UPON. WELL IT WAS AN ANIMAL HAD TRAMPLED SOMEBODY'D KILLED. BECAUSE IT WAS THE SPRING HE SORT OF THOUGHT WELL ASSIST BRING ANIMALS GET RESTAURANTS THE TIME APPROPRIATIONS. EVERYONE KNOWS YOU JUST STAY CLEAR OF THEM AT THIS TIME. HE REASONS IT OUT. THAT I'M TRYING TO GET ATTRACT THIS ANIMAL DOWN AND IT'S GOING TO BE FINE. AND I COULD JUST GO AWAY AND HANG UP MY HAT AND I GOT MY GUN. THIRTY SECONDS COOLEY AS SHE WALKS A GREAT THRONG OF PEOPLE SURROUNDS IN. HE FINDS THE ANIMAL. ALL IS PEACEFUL BUT THERE IS THAT CROWN. AND IT CONCLUDES IT WILL BE YOUR THE SAKE YOU HAVE TO ACT RECKLESSLY YOU HAVE TO RESPOND TO THE CROWD. AND THEN WHERE THE STORY ACTUALLY. THE ESSAY SHOOTING AN ELEPHANT. AGAINST HIS BETTER JUDGMENT HE SHOT AN ELEPHANT WHICH WAS VITAL THAT COMMUNITY. AND THEN HAD TO SIT BY WILL HAVE A LINGERING DEATH. I ACTUALLY FEEL THAT THIS IDEA THAT WE AS PUBLIC OFFICIALS DID NOT TO SHOULD DEVELOP WHEN A RATIONAL MIND SAYS. IT'S NOT THE RIGHT THING TO DO THAT WE NEED TO TAKE A DIFFERENT COURSE AND NOT JUST FOLLOW THE CLAMORING CROWD. WHAT DO WE NEED TO GO BACK TO OUR CONSTITUTION. AND THAT LED BY WHICH WE SEPARATE US FROM ALL OTHER MANKIND. IS THE ISSUE FOR THE STATE FIRE CHEN AYE VOTE- TO LIVE OUT OUR OLD. AND A FIRM THAT WE LIVE IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY DOT THE. FOURTEEN HUNDRED. THANK YOU MISS COOLEY. MR GARCIA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I'M ACTUALLY MOTIVATED BY THE WORDS OF OUR LAST SPEAKER HERE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS RESOLUTION AS A REFLECTIVE OF WHO A REFLECTION OF WHO WE ARE. THIS ISN'T REALLY OUR FIRST ACTION BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE BUSINESS- THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US AND WASHINGTON DC IN THE POLITICS AND THE POLICIES THAT HAVE COME OUT OF THERE THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF OUR POSITION- TO REALLY MAKE IT A POINT TO SAY THAT WE DO NOT STAND FOR- THE POLITICS AND THE POLICIES. THAT HAVE BEEN HURTING PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY- THROUGHOUT THE LAST FOUR YEARS AND I THINK THIS PANDEMIC CLEARLY IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THAT ECONOMY THAT WILL HAVE TO FOCUS ON PURELY IS A REFLECTION OF THAT AND SO I ALSO HOPE THAT THE TAKEAWAY HERE ISN'T THAT- YOU KNOW BUT WE ARE MAKING A COMPARISON BETWEEN POOR WHITE PEOPLE AND POOR. PEOPLE OF COLOR BECAUSE THAT'S NOT I BELIEVE SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD ENTERTAIN OUR DEBATE BECAUSE WE CARE AND THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE WHEN IT COMES TO THAT BUT I WANTED JUST TO SAY THAT I APPRECIATE- THE AUTHOR- WHO I SHARE THE COACHELLA VALLEY GEOGRAPHY IN REPRESENTATION FOR BRINGING THIS RESOLUTION FORWARD. HE IS- DEMONSTRATED A LOT OF COURAGE- DURING THIS TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE AND THIS IS JUST. ONE MORE INDICATION OF. HE MORAL COMPASS AND HOW HE FEELS ABOUT THE PUBLIC SERVICE THAT HE'S BEEN ELECTED TO DO. SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS RESOLUTION FOR I STAND WITH YOU AND EVERYONE ELSE.
