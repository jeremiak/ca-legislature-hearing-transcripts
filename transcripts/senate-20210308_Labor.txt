FIMI PRESENTER ON YOUR BILL SB FIFTY EIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBER SB FIFTY WHICH ENJOY AUTHORED WITH CENTER FOR TWO. WITH PROHIBIT ET FROM A END OF SOCIAL SECURITY NO IN ITS TOP MOST CALMLY MAIL DOCUMENTS LIST THE NUMBER IS REPLACE WITH A MODIFIED UNIQUE IDENTIFIER. IN THIS DAY AND AGE IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT ANY STATE AGENCY WOULD INCLUDE INDIVIDUALS MOST IMPORTANT PERSONAL INFORMATION. ON UNSECURED CORRESPONDENCE BUT UNFORTUNATELY AS WE'VE LEARNED THIS PAST YEAR LITTLE ABOUT THE EDT IS MODERN OR FUNCTIONAL. THE STATE AUDITOR REDNECK RECOMMENDED THIS PRACTICE BE DONE AWAY WITH BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN. YET IT REPORTED NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR THAT EDT HAS CONTINUE TO PLACE CALIFORNIANS AT RISK OF IDENTITY THEFT BY NOT COMPLYING WITH THE RECOMMENDATION- THIS IS MORE CONCERNING NOW SLASH YOUR SURGEON PANDEMIC RELATED UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CLAIMS DRAMATICALLY INCREASED CORRESPONDENCE. WE ARE ALL AWARE THAT UNEMPLOYMENT FRAUD IS RAMPANT DURING THIS PANDEMIC WITH OVER TEN POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS TO POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT CLAIMS BEING PAID OUT BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY. BUREAUCRATIC MALAISE IS NO EXCUSE FOR PUTTING CALIFORNIA'S IDENTITIES AT RISK AND ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DIRECTLY. THERE EXIST A STRONG POSSIBILITY THAT THIS CONTINUE PRACTICE PLACE CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS IDENTITIES AT RISK FOR THE FRAUD THAT EVENTUALLY OCCURRED. MEMBERS I HAVE SHARED WITH THE COMMITTEE MY INTENTION TO AMEND THE BILL IN JUDICIARY COMMITTEE FOR THIS REQUIREMENT TO APPLY ALL CORRESPONDENCE REGARDLESS. OF WHAT'S REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW IRWIN RETURNING AN INDIVIDUAL'S PERSONAL DOCUMENTS THE AMENDMENTS WOULD ALSO SET THE DATE AS OCTOBER FIRST IS THAT DATE. FOR COMPLIANCE OF THE BILL WELL CURRENT LAW REQUIRES STATE AGENCIES TO TRUNCATE AN INDIVIDUAL SO SECURITY NUMBER ON ANY OUTGOING. CORRESPONDENCE BY JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE IT IS EVIDENT THAT WE CANNOT WAIT FOR E. D. TO COMPLY UNTIL THEN. THESE MEMBERS WILL GREATLY IMPROVE THE BILL AND I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE SO THIS BILL TO MOVE FORWARD. BUT WITH ME TODAY I HOPE HOPE IS ONLINE- BECAUSE HE'S NOT HE- TO PROVIDE NEUTRAL EXPERT TESTIMONY OR TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. ON THE AUDIT THE LEAD TO THIS BILL IS BOB HARRIS WHO'S A PRINCIPAL AUDITOR AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE. WELL YES HERE OKAY GREAT SO WITH THAT. I DíAS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU THANK SENATOR- MR- MISTER. JEREMY BERNIE RIGHT YES SO TO SPEAK THE PLEASE REMEMBER THAT MY NAME IS ABOUT. WITH ACCOUNT STATE ON OFF- AS A MATTER MATTER POLICY ARE DOESN'T A FORM POSITION ON BILLS BUT CAN PROVIDE SOME TEST MY AS TO HOW AS FIFTY EIGHT WITH A RECKON. WE'VE MADE IN PRIOR AUDITS BRIEFLY AS THIS IS ALREADY MENTIONED AND BUT IT'S THAT WE'VE RELEASED REVIEWING PRACTICES OF YOU AN APPLY SOCIAL SECURITY NOW TO THAT IT'S OUT TO ITS CLAIM AND WE THAT IT DOES SO VERY FREAKED WITH MY OF ITS MAY. AND DOES SO OF PRE WE RECOMMENDED THAT PER IN FACT WE WRECKED THEY PER. THE THREE MOST COMMONLY MAILED FORMS WHICH IS THE- WHICH OF THE FORMS OF THIS BILL WOULD ADDRESS AND THAT WE RECOMMENDED THEY SEIZE CEASE INCLUDING THE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS ON THOSE FORMS BY MARCH TWENTY TWENTY BUT OUR FOR A FOLLOW UP ON IT BUT WE RELEASED IN NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY FIVE EDT HAD NOT MADE SUFFICIENT PROGRESS ON THAT. AND AS A RESULT DURING THE PANDEMIC HAD MAILED THOSE THREE FORMS ALONE THIRTY FOUR MILLION TIMES JUST FROM MARCH TO OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY. SO THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE EDT TO TAKE ACTION ON RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE'VE MADE THAT IT HAS NOT YET MADE SUFFICIENT PROGRESS ON AND WITH. THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY OF THE COMMITTEES QUESTIONS. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS OF WHO WE- REMEMBER A COMMITTEE. SENATOR- YES- CENTER I'M WILL BE SOME YOUR BILL- JUST HAVE A FOR THE AUDITOR. US FOODS IS THE ORDER. I JUST REMEMBER TO GO PLEASE YOU YOU MAN THAT- THERE WITH OF THREE FOR TYPES OF COME. AND WHICH SUCH THE NUMBERS HAD BEEN INCLUDED- I'M JUST WONDERING DID YOU LOOK INTO WHETHER OR NOT THEY- THAT PRACTICE LEAD TO ANY OF FRAUD OR IDENTITY IDENTITY IDENTITY THEFT. RIGHT- BECAUSE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT. FROM THE HEARINGS THAT WE'VE HAD THAT THE- FRAUD WAS MORE CONNECTED TO OTHER ISSUES AND NOT THIS ONE BUT CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT CONNECTION FOR SWIMMING NO FINDING THAT THERE WAS A DIRECT CONNECTION BETWEEN THE MAILINGS THAT EDT SENDS OUT AND SOMEONE'S IDENTITY BEING STOLEN AND THAT WOULD BE PRETTY DIFFICULT TO DO. BUT WHAT IT DOES DO WHEN YOU MAIL OUT SOME OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER THAT THAT IS A PUTS IT UNNECESSARILY AT RISK AND AS WE SAW DURING THE PANDEMIC PERIOD MAIL IS SHOWING UP TO PEOPLE'S ADDRESSES WHERE IT DIDN'T BELONG AND SOME OF THAT MAIL WE FOUND IN OUR FOLLOW BUT INCLUDED INDIVIDUAL SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS SO IN FACT YOU HAVE IS. ESSENTIALLY A BREACH OF THAT PERSON'S PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION GOING TO SOME PLACE WHERE IT DOESN'T BELONG BEING RECEIVED BY SOMEONE THAT SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU YEAH I WAS ASKING NOT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE OF THE CHANGE BUT BECAUSE I I'D IT'S PUT OUT THERE BUT NOT NECESSARILY ALWAYS A STRAIGHT STRAIGHT CONNECTION SPECIALLY TO THE FRAUD THAT WE'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT.

REVENUE IN MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO START OFF BY CONGRATULATING OF. CENTER CORTES YANIS CHAIRMANSHIP OF THIS COMMITTEE- I'M HERE TODAY TO REPRESENT SB SIXTY ONE WHICH HELPS UNEMPLOYED AND UNDEREMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS ACCESSING COMPLETE JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS THROUGH PROVIDING SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. SB SIXTY ONE IS A RIGHT INVESTMENT FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AS OUR MOST VULNERABLE ARE IN DANGER OF BEING PULLED FARTHER AWAY FROM ACHIEVING THEIR AMERICAN DREAM. THIS BILL REQUIRES THAT CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD TO LIFT. UP LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS BY PROVIDING SUPPORTIVE SERVICES TO THEM WHILE THEY WORK TO COMPLETE WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAMS. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES THE BOARD TO DEVELOP ADDITIONAL EMPLOYMENT PARTNERSHIPS TO ADDRESS DISPLACEMENT OF WORKERS. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY INCLUDING FARMWORKERS AND DISCONNECTED AT RISK AT RISK YOUTH IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE PROACTIVELY ADDRESS UNEMPLOYMENT AMONG VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND PARTICULARLY IN THE ROLE CENTRAL VALLEY MANY WORKFORCE TRAINING PARTICIPANTS ARE UNABLE TO COMPLETE THEIR JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS DUE TO A LACK OF AFFORDABLE TRANSPORTATION OR AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE. SB SIXTY ONE WILL HELP PROVIDE IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE TO UNEMPLOYED AND UNDEREMPLOYED WORKERS THAT ARE PURSUING OR WOULD LIKE TO PURSUE WORKFORCE TRAINING. BUT HAVE REAL LIFE CHALLENGES STANDING IN THEIR WAY. THIS MEASURE IS NEEDED NOW MORE THAN EVER TO IMPROVE THE ABILITY. OF LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS TO PUT TO MAKE PROGRESS IN THEIR CAREERS AND DOING SO WILL HAVE A FOUNDATIONAL IMPACT ON DISRUPTING MULTI GENERATIONAL POVERTY. I HAVE A TWO DAY THREE WITNESSES WHO ARE JOINING US REMOTELY. AND I WILL LET THEM INTRODUCE THEMSELVES. THANK YOU SENATOR HER DAUGHTER. WE HAVE THE FIRST WITNESS INTRODUCE THEMSELVES. I'M GONNA AYE KALISH- THANK YOU CHAIR OF THE STATE'S CHILD POVERTY TASK FORCE. A MAN I CONTINUE YES PLEASE. OKAY MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THE FIRST THANKS TO SENATOR TITLE FOR STICKING WITH THIS- IMPORTANT BILL AT THE END OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE STATE CHILD POVERTY TASK FORCE ISSUED ITS COMPREHENSIVE RECOMMENDATIONS ELIMINATING DEEP CHILD POVERTY IN CALIFORNIA AND REDUCING ITS OVERALL BY AT LEAST FIFTY PERCENT. THE GOVERNOR NEWSOM IS CALLED THE COMPREHENSIVE RECOMMENDATIONS THE FRAMEWORK FOR CALIFORNIA'S FOUR POINT EIGHT BILLION IN ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN ADDRESSING CHILD FAMILY POVERTY SINCE THAT TIME A KEY ASPECT WAS STRENGTHENING- WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAMS OF THE WORK FORCE TRAINING- SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE TASK FORCE WAS CHAIRED BY THE POLICY AND RESEARCH DIRECTOR. OF THE STATE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD AND THEY WERE TASKED WITH INVESTIGATING EXISTING WORKFORCE PROGRAMS AND POLICIES THEY FOUND THAT THE PRIMARY REASON LOW INCOME PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS WERE NOT ABLE TO COMPLETE PROGRAMS. WERE UNRELIABLE CHILD CARE THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE TRANSPORTATION AND. OTHER SUPPORTS LIKE SECURE HOUSING- THIS. AND STOPS THE HOLD FORCE. EMPHASIZED THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT COULD BE DONE IN THE WORK FORCE AND TRAINING AREA IS TO REMOVE THE BARRIERS TO PARTICIPATION AND COMPLETION OF WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAMS BY LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS SPECIFICALLY INCLUDING DISCONNECTED YOUTH. AND DISPLACED WORKERS INCLUDING THOSE WORKING IN AGRICULTURE BY PROVIDING DEDICATED FUNDING FOR CHILDCARE TRANSPORTATION AND OTHER SUPPORTS LIKE HOUSING. THE BOTTOM LINE IS PEOPLE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GET TO AND FROM WORK I HAVE TO HAVE A RELIABLE CHILD CARE HOUSING SECURITY AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE. IT'S THE MISSING LINK IN MAXIMIZING THE EFFECTIVENESS BUT WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAMS AND WE ARE CHEN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER HALL MR CALLS. THE NEXT WITNESS IDENTIFY.

THANK YOU MODERATOR- WILL KNOW- BRING BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE- ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS BY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CENTER DRAWS OF. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR ON BRINGING THIS- FORWARD- I IN MY EXPERIENCE IN THE WITH TRAINING PROGRAMS. NO DOUBT THAT LOW INCOME WORKERS- BENEFIT THE MOST- WHEN THEY HAVE THE- TRAINING THAT THEY NEED. ESPECIALLY IF THE PROGRAM IS REALLY TARGETING NOT JUST SORT OF GENERALLY WHOEVER SHOWS UP BUT REALLY TARGETED- AND I KNOW THAT WITHOUT- THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED- THAT IT'S IT BECOMES THANK YOU RAIMES IMPOSSIBLE- SO I THINK THAT'S REALLY GREAT. THAT YOU'RE PUTTING FORWARD PROVIDING THOSE- I ALSO SEE THE- THAT THE PREMISE OF THE HIGHROAD PARTNERSHIPS. IS A PIECE OF THIS AND I'M I'M REALLY THRILLED WITH THAT BECAUSE I'VE ALSO FOUND THAT THERE HAD BEEN THESE TRAINING PROGRAMS IN MY EXPERIENCE. THAT DID THE TRAINING AND SOMETIMES DID SERVICES SOMETIMES DIDN'T BUT THEN AT THE END COULDN'T DELIVER A QUALITY JOB. AND SO HERE THEY WERE BACK IN A DIFFERENT INDUSTRY. MAY BE. AT MINIMUM WAGE AND NO BENEFITS AND NO YOU KNOW NOTHING REALLY TO LOOK FORWARD TO IN THEIR LIVES SO. I REALLY LIKE THAT A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND WORKERS TO BE ABLE TO GET TO A QUALITY PAID JOB IS. IS ESSENTIAL SO ANOTHER QUESTION JUST COMMEND YOU AND UNLESS YOU HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO SAY ALONG THOSE LINES BUT I THINK ALL THOSE ELEMENTS MAKE THIS. A GOOD INVESTMENT THANK YOU. THANK ANY. DISCUSS THIS CHAU CHAVEZ. HI HELLO OUR DISTRICT- IT'S MANAGED THAT IN PREVIOUS YEARS WHEN THIS BILL WAS PASSED THAT THERE WAS A CAP ON THE GRANT PER RECIPIENT BY ANDERSON AND THIS ONE DOES NOT HAVE A CAP IS YOUR REASON FOR THAT. PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR BOB. SO IF THE CAP WAS REMOVED BECAUSE OF NECESSARY SUPPORTS IN THE COST OF THE SUPPORTS WILL BE DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT REGIONS SO THAT THE SUPPORT SO WE GET IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY PERHAPS ARE NOT THE SAME COSTS THAT YOU WOULD GET LIKE YOU KNOW IN SAN FRANCISCO OR SACRAMENTO. AND SO THAT THERE'S GOT TO BE GET WE GOT HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT FLEXIBILITY THEY'RE PERFECTLY FINE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL IT'S NOT A ONE TIME BUDGET I ALWAYS SAY IT OKAY THAT MAKES ABSOLUTE SENSE THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT- THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD- THIS BILL ARM IS EXTENDED FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT THE APA. OUR WHICH ALLOWS FOR PUBLIC INPUT AND SCRUTINY- JUST KIND OF CURIOUS TO KNOW WHY IT WAS EXCLUDED FROM THAT. TEMPERAMENT. SO IT SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE STREAMLINED GETTING THESE GRANTS TO THE COMMUNITIES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WITH THE URGENCY IT IS THERE- AND IN PART- NOW MORE THAN EVER BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC WE NEED TO. THAT'S WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO. AT THE EXEMPTION AND THEREFORE THERE FOR THOSE PURPOSES. SO WOULD THERE BE A SAFETY OR ACCOUNTABILITY ON THESE FUNDS IF. MOVING FORWARD. I WOULD SAY SO- AND I CAN PROVIDE YOU WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION MOVING FORWARD ON HOW THAT ACCOUNTABILITY- IT'S BEING MADE- BUT WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT THE AP WHAT THE LADY. OUR WHAT DELAY GETTING THESE GRANTS TO THE COMMUNITIES- TO THE INDIVIDUALS THAT NEED IT THE MOST OF THE TIME WHEN. THANK GOD THEY NEED THE MOST IT. YEAH A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING AT THE MOMENT AND NEED TO FIND A WAY TO GET BACK INTO THE WORKFORCE. AND ONE LAST QUESTION SO HELP ME UNDERSTAND SO MOVING FORWARD IS THAT WITH THIS IS AND I UNDERSTAND THE STREAMLINING PART BECAUSE I. DON'T CARE FOR ADMINISTRATIVE RED TAPE AND LENGTHENING THE PROCESS AND MANY OF THE ITEMS AND ISSUES BUT I DO BELIEVE IN TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF COURSE- SO IS THIS WOULD BE WOULD THIS BE TEMPORARILY RIGHT NOW IT AS WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE PANDEMIC AND- WE'RE DEALING WITH A WITH THE ISSUES DUE TO THE- SHUT DOWN AND SO FORTH. SO SB SIXTY- AND IT'S ALSO- IT GOES ALONG WITH THE BUDGET REQUEST A FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. AND THE BUDGET PROCESS FOR THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. CHANCE IT'S A ONE WAY OF. MAKING SURE THAT THOSE DOLLARS ARE BEING USED IN THE WAY THAT DATE. THIRTY SHOULD BE USED. BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT THE- THE LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. BOARDS TO. OKAY THANK YOU FOR.

THE TEMPORARY NATURE OF THESE POSITIONS OF NINE MONTHS HAS BEEN SUCH THAT THE FIRE SEASON HAS STARTED TO. EXTEND PAST THE TIME THAT THEY ARE SUPPOSEDLY TEMPORARY WORKERS. AND SO I THINK THAT THIS IS A VERY GOOD MEASURE. BECAUSE IT STARTS TO PUT IN PLACE THE RIGHTS AND THE PROCEDURES FOR PEOPLE TO OPERATE WHEN THEY START TO BROUGHT UP AGAINST THAT. AND I THINK WE WERE AS A GROUP OF GOING TO HAVE A REAL DECISION TO MAKE AT SOME POINT. ABOUT WHETHER WE WANT TO HAVE MORE PERMANENT FIREFIGHTERS IN LIEU OF SEASONAL WORKERS IF WE HAVE- FIRE SEASON THAT JUST GOES TWELVE MONTHS A YEAR. END AND THERE IS NO BREAK SO I THINK THIS IS A GOOD BILL I'M GONNA BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT. WILL BE THRILLED TO MOVE IT WHEN I FINALLY GET THE CHANCE. THEY SHOULD OF- GIVEN THE- OPPORTUNITY FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION AND OF COURSE WE GOT TO GO- WILL NEED TO GO BACK CENTER MCGUIRE FROM OPENING TO CLOSE OF.

PROTECTS THE PROMISED AND PAID FOR RETIREMENT BENEFITS OF CALPERS MEMBERS BY MAKING SURE THAT NO HARM COMES TO RETIREE FOR ANY COLLECTIVELY BARGAINED PENSIONABLE COMPENSATION THAT WAS REPORTED TO THE SYSTEM. THIS MEASURE RESPONSE TO CASES IN WHICH PENSION WILL COMPENSATION OF RETIRED EMPLOYEES IS RETROACTIVELY DEEMED DISALLOWED BY CALPERS IN THESE INSTANCES THE RETIRED EMPLOYEES ARE FORCED TO PAY BACK A TOTAL OF WERE OVERPAID AMOUNT AND SUFFER PERMANENT REDUCTIONS IN THEIR PENSIONS. BATTERY TOO MANY RETIREES LIVE ON FIXED INCOMES AND SHOULD NOT HAVE TO EXPERIENCE UNEXPECTED CUTS TO THEIR BENEFITS AT NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN LONG AFTER THEY HAVE RETIRED FIFTY TO SEVENTY ACRES MIND THAT THE RETIREMENT THAT THEY EARNED AND PAID FOR. OVER A LIFE OF PUBLIC SERVANTS WILL CONSISTENTLY BE THERE THROUGHOUT THEIR RETIREMENT YEARS. THIS BILL REQUIRES CALPERS AND EMPLOYERS TO WORK TOGETHER TO PROTECT RETIREE BENEFITS AND PREVENT THESE INSTANCES FROM EVER HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE SB TWO SEVENTY ALSO COMPELS EMPLOYERS TO KEEP THEIR PROMISE TO RETIREES AND HOLD THEM HARMLESS FOR ANY REDUCTIONS TO THE RETIREMENT AS A RESULT OF DISALLOWED COMPENSATION. WITH ME TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS DOUG SUPERS BUT THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS MEMBERS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. THERE WERE NO TO MOVE ON TO ANYONE THOUGH WISHING TO TESTIFY IN THE CENTER LEAVE A- ON. YOUR SUPPORT WITNESSES PRESENT COMBINE ABILITIES CALLING IT YES. ASSEMBLY THIS DOG SUPERS IS THAT CORRECT YES RIGHT MISTER SERVERS- IF YOU'RE HEARING ME- PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS THIS IS A DOG SERVERS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS REPRESENTING MORE THAN THIRTY THOUSAND CAREER FIREFIGHTING AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICE PERSONNEL STATEWIDE WE ARE PLEASED TO SUPPORT AND SPONSOR SB TWO SEVEN EIGHT ONE LIKE TO THANK SENATOR LINDA FOR HER ONGOING WORK TO PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT SECURITY FOR PUBLIC SERVANTS. THIS ISSUE FIRST CAME TO SERBIA WHEN A FIREFIGHTER EMPLOYED BY THE CITY OF DAVIS RETIRED AFTER SERVING THE PUBLIC FOR NEARLY THIRTY YEARS AFTER FIVE YEARS OF THE TYERMAN CALPERS NOTIFIED THE RETIRED FIREFIGHTER THAT THE CITY OF DAVIS HAD REPORTED CERTAIN COMPENSATION I CALPERS BELIEVED WAS DISALLOWED. CONSEQUENTLY THE SYSTEM SOUGHT TO COLLECT REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE OVERPAYMENT NOT FROM THE CITY THAT HAVE BARGAINED I REPORTED TO GOSHEN COMPENSATION BUT INSTEAD FROM THE RETIRED FIREFIGHT. REIMBURSEMENTS ON THE CALPERS INCLUDED A LUMP SUM AMOUNT OF FORTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS ON A SIZEABLE FUTURE REDUCTION IN THE RETIRED FIREFIGHTERS. RETIREMENT ALLOWANCE SBI'S CALLED ACADEMIC BENEFIT THAT WAS COLLECTIVELY BARGAINED AND PAID FOR BY THE EMPLOYEE AND THE EMPLOYER LIKE MANY RETIREES ONE A FIREFIGHTER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER OR SCHOOL EMPLOYEE RETIRES THEY WILL HAVE A FIXED MONTHLY. PENSION TO MEET THEIR DAY TO DAY. MOREOVER UNLIKE PRESENTS A EMPLOYEE MANY. AND INCLUDING OUTSIDE PERSON OF PUBLIC SAFETY. DO NOT. SO SECURITY BENEFITS. FOR THESE RETIRED SIX. IS TYPICALLY ONLY OF RETIREMENT INCOME. THIS BILL SEEKS TO PROTECT THAT RETIREE BY ENSURING THE BENEFIT THAT WAS BARGAINING PAID FOR IS MAINTAINED. AND THE SITUATION FOR THE DAVIS FIREFIGHTER DOES NOT HAPPEN FOR FUTURE RETIREES. EXISTING ALONG CALPERS REGULATION HAS. ESTABLISHED RULES AROUND CATEGORIES OF COMPENSATION SUCH AS LONGEVITY K. HAS OKAY AND EDUCATIONAL CENTER K. SOME EXAMPLES OF THESE ROLLS AROUND THIS COMPENSATION MOST. IS THAT THE COMPENSATION MUST BE AVAILABLE TO THE ENTIRE GROUP OF CLASSES ELIGIBLE FOR THE ADAM. AND THE COMPETITION I DON'T- IS AVAILABLE ON A- JEWEL PLEASE BAR ADAMS ARE TO BE. AND REPORTED TO THE SYSTEM OKAY IF THEY ARE NOT WE COULD FIND A SITUATION WHERE PAN AM IS DISALLOWED BY THE SYSTEM. GENERATIONS OF HARD WORKING MEMBERS IN CALIFORNIA'S MIDDLE CLASS HAVE DEDICATED THEIR CAREERS TO PUBLIC SERVICE OFTEN EARNING LESS OVER THE COURSE OF THEIR CAREER WHEN COMPARED TO THEIR PRIVATE INDUSTRY COUNTERPARTS TO EARN AND PAY FOR THE PROMISE OF A SECURE RETIREMENT. WE BELIEVE SB TWO SEVEN EIGHT IS IT IMPORTANT MEASURE TO PROTECT THE PROMISE OF A SECURE RETIREMENT FOR THESE REASONS AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SUBER'S.

HI MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE DILLON GIBBONS WITH THE ALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION TO U. S. B. TWO SEVENTY EIGHT- THANKS FOR ALLOWING ME TO CALL AND- FIRST I'D LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT IT'S TRULY UNFORTUNATE WHEN RETIREES HAVE THEIR PENSIONS CUT. YOUR NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. AND WE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER TO FIND A REMEDY AS WELL AS IDENTIFY STEPS SHOULD BE TAKEN TO PREVENT IT FROM EVER HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE. UNFORTUNATELY SB TWO SEVEN EIGHT IS NOT THE APPROPRIATE READY FOR MAKING RETIREES WHOSE PENSIONS ARE CUT HOLE. WHEN CALPERS TAKES STEPS TO DISALLOW CERTAIN PENSION BENEFITS BECAUSE THOSE BENEFITS VIOLATE PENSION LAW. CALPERS IS UNABLE TO PAY OUT A PENSION TO VIOLATE THE LAW IN THE SAME WAY THE PUBLIC AGENCIES WILL BE UNABLE TO PAY FOR PENSION BENEFITS THE PILOT THE LAW. CONTINUED PAYMENT OF AN UNLAWFUL BENEFIT TO RETIREES WOULD COST YOU TO GET THE PUBLIC FUNDS. THE VIOLATION OF SECTION SIX OF ARTICLE SIXTEEN OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. SUCH VIOLATIONS REPUBLICAN REP TO DEFEND ITSELF AND POP EDUCATION LAWSUITS. FILED BY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. ALLEN PUT AGENCY TO PAY. PENSIONS BY EXTENSION FROM AND CERTAIN THE EMPLOYEES PENSION REFORM ACT. BETTER KNOWN AS PAPA. THIS IS WHAT GOVERNOR BROWN B. TO A SIMILAR BILL TWENTY. TO BE- MET. ABOUT THE IN PART. OF THIS BILL WOULD ESTABLISH RETIREE BERMAN RIGHT TO INCORRECTLY. PENSION BENEFITS AND CAN WHERE AN ERROR RESULT. IN THE RETIREE THAN BENEFITS THAT BY LAW. I SURE THE OPTIONS YOU THAT ATTENTION MUST BE CORRECTLY CALCULATED ACCORDING TO THE LAW IN THE FIRST INSTANCE. SO THAT RETIREES NEVER FIND THEMSELVES ON THE HOOK FOR OVERPAYMENT. PLEASE ENTER USER NEEDED TO CORRECT THAT SITUATION. BUT I'M CONCERNED THAT THIS BILLS BROAD PROVISIONS COULD BE EASILY USED TO CIRCUMVENT LIMITATIONS IN LAW INTENDED TO PROTECT THE GOVERNMENT. AND ULTIMATELY TAXPAYERS. THE PENSIONS BY INDEED AND A- OF A ERROR THIS BILL WOULD AFFECT. EFFECTUATE THAT ERROR FOR THE REST THE MEMBERS. THE SIXTY TAX THE ATTACK EXPENSE IN. AGAIN IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT AFTERNOON AGENCY AND THE PRO AND IT CAME TO AGREEMENT ON BENEFITS AND THOSE BENEFITS BE PAID FOR ANY OUT OF POCKET. AFTER THAT BUT IF TO BE FROM THE RETIRED. IF YOU JUST MAKE IT MORE ME OR AFTER CONTEMPT TO DO. PUBLIC AGENCIES AND CONTINUE TO MAKE. PAYMENTS DIRECTLY TO WEEK FROM ON OCTOBER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS I YOUR MOBILE SB TWO SEVENTY. THANK YOU MISTER SERVED IN MY POLL SIR FOR ME ON TO THE RUBIO CALLING UPON YOU YOU WERE OF. A SHOULD HAVE GONE EARLIER ON THE AGENDA- I UNDERSTAND THERE IS- ANOTHER OPPOSITION WITNESS ONLINE IS THAT CORRECT. YES MR HERE CAN YOU HEAR ME THIS IS THE ST MARY R. WITH THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES WE CAN HEAR YOU FINE- PLEASE CONTINUE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON. THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES IS OPPOSED SB TWO SEVENTY EIGHT WE SHARE LARGELY THE CONCERN BUT MY COLLEAGUE AT THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION SHARED. PRIMARILY THAT WE ENGAGE AND BARGAIN IN GOOD FAITH. TO ESTABLISH THESE BENEFITS WERE COMMITTED TO PAYING THEM AT THE POINT WHEN THEY WERE NEGOTIATED. BUT UNFORTUNATELY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE CALPERS. OFTENTIMES AFTER SEVERAL AUDITS DETERMINES. THAT THE BENEFITS ARE DISALLOWED. FOR US YOU HAVE BIG SHOULDER THAT COST AND MAKE UP FOR DETERMINATION THAT'S MADE BY CALPERS WE THINK ON ON OUR END. IT IS PROPS FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR BUT ALSO DOESN'T DO ANYTHING TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE. OF MAKING SURE THAT OUR BARGAINING AGREEMENTS ARE PROPERLY OVERSEEN. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE RESPONSIBILITY BE TAKEN ON BY THE PENSION SYSTEM IN BEING INVOLVED. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL BROAD REVISIONS PRESENT NOT JUST A LARGE FISCAL COMMITMENT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. BUT AS MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED DO CERTAINLY CREATE A MORAL HAZARD THAT COULD ALLOW CIRCUMVENTING UP HAVE BROKE WHICH DEEPLY CONCERNS US FROM A GOOD GOVERNANCE PERSPECTIVE. THAT COUPLED WITH THE UNRESOLVED QUESTION OF HOW BENEFITS BUT CALPERS DETERMINES OUR LEGAL TO PAY CAN SOMEHOW BEING EIGHT LEGAL IF WE AT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WORK AND MAKE THEM. STILL REMAINS UNRESOLVED AND WE DO THINK PRESENTS A SERIOUS QUESTION. AS TO WHETHER THIS MEASURE OF THE APPROPRIATE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM. BUT THE ADVOCATES IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE OF RIGHTLY IDENTIFIED AS IT WISHES THAT. RETIREES CAN BE LEFT ON THE HOOK FOR WHEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. OF CAR WE'RE WE'RE DEEPLY COMMITTED TO TRYING TO RESOLVE THE SITUATION AND NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH BUT THE ADVOCATES ON THE OTHER SIDE. TO TRY AND RESOLVE THE ISSUE BUT THIS MEASURE AS IT CURRENTLY IS PRESENT DEEP. FISCAL AND GOVERNANCE CHALLENGES. TO US INTO OUR MEMBERSHIP AND WE BECAUSE OF THE BAD WE RESPECTFULLY AND HUMBLY HAVE TO OPPOSE THE LEGISLATION AND REQUEST YOUR KNOW. ABOUT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. OKAY THANK YOU BELIEVE THAT THE- SO TESTAMENT IT WOULD RECEIVE ON LAW- BECAUSE I TOOK THE- IS A SITE YOU ARE. OLD CALL ONE MORE TIME FOR ME WITH THIS IN THE- IN ROOM TWENTY FOUR. UNINDICTED THE MODERATOR- ONE MORE TIME DO WE HAVE ANY OPPOSITION WITNESSES TO S. B. TWO SEVENTY EIGHT- QUEUED UP TO TESTIFY THROUGH THE TELECONFERENCE ORVIS. IF THERE ARE ANY OF SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO ON YOUR TOUCH TONE PHONE AT THIS TIME. WE'LL GO TO LINE FORTY SIX GO AHEAD PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CHECHNYA WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. ALSO REGRETFULLY OPPOSED TO THE BILL. THANK YOU. THERE ANY OTHER SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. MISTER CHAIRMAN WE HAVE KNOWN QUEUED UP AT THIS TIME. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MR MODERATOR- WE WILL COME BACK. TO THE COMMITTEE AT THIS TIME AND LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FIRST BROWSER I JUST MOVE THE BILL. OKAY WILL COME BACK TO FOR THE MOTION- SOON AS A MATTER BY SURE CUT COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. PLEASE PLEASE. I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT THIS BILL FORWARD BECAUSE I CAN'T IMAGINE BEING A RETIREE AND RECEIVING A BALE OF. IN A FORTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IN BACK PAY- THAT HAD TO BE RETURNED I THINK OF IT OF NEW HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE REASSESSING THEIR PROPERTIES AND GET THAT HE SAYS YOU KNOW- PROPERTY TAX BILL AND THEY KIND OF LOOK AT YOU THAT'S WHAT IS THIS DO SO. A LOT OF INFORMATION BEING DISCLOSED RIGHT NOW WITH NEW HOMEOWNERS LETTING THEM KNOW YOU WILL BE RECESSED AND YOU WILL BE GETTING A SUPPLEMENTAL TAX BILL- BUT I AM A LITTLE CONCERNED BECAUSE- AS I LOOK AT THIS BILL- I KEEP ASKING MYSELF NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IS DOES THIS BILL FIX. THE ISSUE. AND MY QUESTION IS- BECAUSE WE HAD TO ENTITIES THAT ARE IT THAT ARE BURKE THAT REPRESENT THE BEST. OR THE INTEREST OF THE RETIREE. OR THE EMPLOYEE I WANTED TO GO SHE ADDED. AS A FRESHMAN CENTER HELP ME UNDERSTAND HOW IS IT THAT THEY CAN NEGOTIATE FOR THE BARGAINING UNIT AND THE AGENCY. CAN NEGOTIATE A CONTRACT AND THEN HAVE CALPERS SAY THESE ITEMS ARE DISALLOWED THESE ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THERE. AND IS THERE A LIST OF THINGS THAT ARE NOT ALLOWED. I'M I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO YOU MAKE THIS BILL- I GUESS WORTHY OF PROTECTING THE RETIREES FROM EVER HAPPENING AGAIN AND WHAT WOULD HAVE TO BE INCLUDED IN THIS BILL IN ORDER TO PROTECT RETIREES FROM BARGAINING SCENARIOS WHERE IT MAKES SENSE EXPECT SUSCEPTIBLE TO THIS BECAUSE IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING IN THAT NATURE THEN THE TAXPAYERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PICKING UP THE BILL FOR THESE FOR THESE TYPE OF. CONTRACTS OR- THESE THIS ALLOWABLE IS- BECAUSE SOMEBODY HAS TO PAY AND IT'S WHETHER IT'S THE RETIRED OR NOT IT'S ULTIMATELY THE TAXPAYER. RICK THANK YOU SENATOR I'M GONNA TAKE A STAB AT IT AND THEN I THINK DOUG IS STILL ON THE LINE THEY'RE GOING TO ASK YOU TO JUMP IN IF I DON'T GET IT QUITE RIGHT. WHEN GOVERNOR BROWN VETOED THIS BILL BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ONE OF THE% THINGS HE ASKED WAS THAT THERE SHOULD BE POLICIES IN PLACE TO REQUIRE THAT CALPERS REVIEW AND APPROVE ANY PROPOSAL FOR POTENTIAL COMPENSATION IN AN MO YOU BEFORE IT IS FINALIZED. TO HELP MAKE SURE THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN WITH THIS ALLOWABLE COMPENSATION TO SEVENTY EIGHT DOES THAT SO WE THINK THAT THIS BILL FIXES THAT PROBLEM AND I'M JUST HOUSING DOUG TO JUMP IN IF HE THINKS THE THERE'S MORE TO IT THAT SHOULD BE ADDED. MISTER SUPERSU ABOARD AT. THANKS MISTER CHAIRMAN CENTER LEYVA I THINK I'M I WOULD I WOULD JUST ADD THAT- THE THERE ARE THERE IS A LIST OF PHONES COMPENSABLE ITEMS AND REGULATIONS AROUND THOSE ITEMS THAT THAT CALPERS MAINTAINS BUT- IN ADDITION TO THE THAT LISTA BEING PROVIDED- THOSE PAY ITEMS ALSO HAVE TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN A FASHION THROUGHOUT THE TERM OF. YOUR CONTRACT- THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE RULES JUST SO FOR EXAMPLE- AND INCENTIVE PAY ITEM MAYBE FOR EDUCATIONAL INCENTIVE PAID THE OUR UNDERSTANDING IT NEEDS TO BE OFFERED TO THE ENTIRE CLASS SO FOR EXAMPLE ANYBODY THAT- IN- A SUBSET OF THE EMPLOYER. PLEASE ACHIEVED THIS IT. PAY EITHER MORE OUT OF CERTIFICATE AND BACHELOR'S DEGREE FROM- EVERYBODY IN THE CLASS WE NEED TO BE OFFERED THAT- THAT BENEFIT. IF FOR SOME REASON THE EMPLOYER THERE WAS IMPLEMENTED A MATTER WHAT THE EMPLOYER ONLY PROVIDED THAT BENEFITS US UPSET- DOES INTO. AT THAT HAD MET EDGE- INCENTIVE REQUIREMENTS IT THAT COULD BE SUBJECT OR- THE PAY ITEM BEING DISALLOWED BECAUSE IT WAS OFFERED TO THE- ENTIRE CLASS SO. IN ADDITION YOU KNOW THE PROMISE OF THE BILLS THAT THIS WAS A BARGAIN AND- CONTINUED FOR BENEFIT THAT AT THE TIME EVERYBODY BELIEVED- WAS APPROPRIATE. HOWEVER PERHAPS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OR OTHER OTHER SITUATION- IT WASN'T IMPLEMENTED FASHION WHICH RESULTS IN THE DISALLOWED COMPENSATION AND RIGHT NOW THE EMPLOYEE- IS LEFT WITH THE ENTIRE OBLIGATION AND- LESSER RECOURSE AFTER THEY'VE. ALREADY RETIRED BUT THE. SO IT THERE TIME FOR ME WHICH- THESE CONTRACTS HAVE TO BE. VETTED AND CONFIRMED AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY NEED- THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS OF WHAT IS ALLOWED. EACH THE BA IS DIFFERENT AND WHEN IT IS COLLECTIVELY BARGAINED AT THAT WOULD HAVE TIME FRAME SENATE DEPENDING ON WHAT CLASSIFICATION WAS BEING BARGAINED ARE YOU IS THAT WHAT YOUR QUESTION SENATOR OR YOUR QUESTION. WHEN CAN THE IS THERE A TIME FRAME IN WHICH THEY CAN GO AFTER THESE MONIES. LIKE A SUNSET. SO I THINK WHAT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND ASKED TO. WHEN THESE THESE. THESE NEGOTIATIONS ARE COMPLETED THEIR SUBMITTED TO CALPERS HOW LONG SHOULD WE HAVE THIS OPEN. S. T. BEING LEGITIMATE SO THAT IN THE FUTURE WE DON'T HAVE THEM COMING BACK AND SAYING THREE FOUR FIVE YEARS LATER SAYING OKAY WE ONLY OWE THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY BECAUSE WE OVERPAID YOU I'M TRYING TO JUST TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHEN CAN WE CAN WE IS IT REASONABLE TO ASK FOR EIGHTY. TIME PERIOD IN WHICH THESE CONTRACTS SHOULD BE VERIFIED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY MEET- LEGAL REQUIREMENTS PER SE- SO THAT. THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN. BUT WHAT YOU'RE IN THIS BILL DOES NOT DO WHAT YOU'RE ASKING SAY OKAY DID IT YOU THAT YOU WIN THEY THEY GET TOGETHER AND THE NEGOTIATE WITH THE BENEFIT SHOULD BE ALLOWED COMPENSATION DISALLOWED COMPENSATION IT HAS TO BE AGREED UPON OF WITHIN X. AMOUNT OF DAYS MONTHS WEEKS THIS BILL DOES NOT DO THAT DO YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING TO THAT. THERE'S A TIME FRAME IN THE BILL YES I. YEAH THAT'S NOT GOOD THAT'S AND IF I MADE THE- I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT SUBDIVISION SEEING- IN THE MEASURE IF I. EMPLOYER A LACK TO HAVE A. I HAVE- PROPOSAL REVIEW- BY. STATE CAN DO SO. UNDER THE BILL. AND HAVE- VIEW THE ITEM AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE THAT- YOU KNOW THE PATTERN THAT ARE IN THE- MEMO YOU. AMONG YOUR IN. MAY I- THE MEMBERSHIP I AM I'M IN THE QUESTION OF TOO IN THEN PARDON ME IF I'M WRONG I'LL CAN- CORRECT ME- WHICH IS THAT THIS POINT IN THE IS THERE- ANY KIND OF BURDEN CAL. TO A STEP HIS DROP THE DAY SO THIS FOR- FOUR WHEN THE COOLS. THANK YOU FOR. CENTER URBAN READY TO COMMENT WHENEVER OKAY YOU'RE DONE. SO MY CONCERN IS THAT ALTHOUGH THIS BILL PROTECTS THE RETIREE. THE ISSUE AT HAND IS NOT FIXED BY THIS BILL IS THAT CORRECT WE DO BELIEVE IT IS FIXED BY THIS BILL YES. DATE ONLY THE ISSUE OF THE RETIREE BILL PROTECTED CORRECT. AT THE END PART OF WHAT I THINK I TRIED TO ANSWER THAT WHEN YOU ASKED IT IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT WE TRIED TO ADDRESS THAT IN THE VETO MESSAGE FROM GOVERNOR BROWNBACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND WE DO BELIEVE THAT CALPERS IS HAS MORE RESPONSIBILITY NOW AND THAT IT DOES GO A LONG WAY OF FIXING THAT PROBLEM. OKAY OKAY. WITH YOUR. I'M JUST ONE COMMENT- OR QUESTION M. WHAT HAVE WITH- NON REPRESENT AT EMPLOYEES SO NON UNION EMPLOYEES CAN THIS HAPPEN TO THEM AND WILL THEY BE PROTECTED UNDER THIS BILL OF COURSE IT CAN HAPPEN TO NON REPRESENT EMPLOYEES AND THAT'S A GREAT POINT FOR WHY YOU SHOULD BE UNION MEMBER BECAUSE THEN YOU HAVE PROTECTIONS BUT IF YOU'RE NON UNION MEMBER YOU DO NOT HAVE A COLLECTIVELY BARGAINED AGREEMENT SO THIS WOULD NOT APPLY TO YOU. SO THEY DON'T HAVE IT YOU WOULD HAVE SOME SORT OF AN AGREEMENT WITH YOUR EMPLOYER THERE WAS NOT COLLECTIVELY BARGAINED AND IS NOT ENFORCEABLE. OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WELCOME OKAY THANK YOU AND UP TO SENATOR- I CAN'T HELP MY BUT TRYING CALM IT HERE IS THE AND OF PUT SOME POINTS ON THIS THIS BILL IS ABOUT AN INJUSTICE. AND INJUSTICE IS SOMEBODY MAKES A DECISION BASED ON WHAT CALPERS TELLS THEM ABOUT WHETHER THEY HAVE THE FINANCIAL WHERE WITH ALL TO RETIRE AND THEY CAN LIVE OFF OF THEIR RETIREMENT. A AND A NUMBER OF YEARS IN- THIS IT'S MUCH LOWER AND IT'S NOT JUST OF THE FORTUNE SITUATION WHERE THEY HAVE TO LIVE OFF OF MUCH LESS THAN I THOUGHT THEY WERE WHEN THEY RETIRED. THEY BACK THE DIFFERENCE SETTING A TIME DEADLINE JUST MEANS THAT IF WITH THE DAVIS FIREFIGHTER THERE WAS AN INJUSTICE AT FIVE YEARS HE JUST MOVED IN JUSTICE TO TWO YEARS OR ONE YEAR BUT AT LEAST THE INJUSTICE. AND SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT TO DO HERE AND I THINK THAT. WHAT THIS BILL DOES THIS BY PUTTING THE ONUS ON THE EMPLOYER WHO IS THE. ONE THAT DOES THE REPORTING. THE HI TO IT'S GOING TO BE A MOTOR- FOR CORRECT REPORT. THEY HAD A RIGHT ED AND DEEP DOWN QUE. SHOULD BE THE ONE THAT THAT TAKES A BIT SHARE OF. BUT A IS HOW IT IS THREE. THAT THEN HOW ARE CALPERS. THE TERM IT WE- TO THE PROBLEM. ANY. BUT I SPENT TWENTY FIVE AS A LAW GUY EMPLOYEE IN THE COW SYSTEM. A AND THINK I WAS. BY YOU FOR FORTY OF THE TIME IN A MEMBER OF THE U. AND I GOT. APPOINTED PICK ME SOME RELEASE THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE MAN BECAUSE WERE ON. WE WERE AT THEIR MERCY AND IF THEY MAKE IN THEIR THAT SHOULD BE A TO EXACTLY THE SAME WAY AND THEY SHOULD BE LIABLE AN EXACT THE SAME WAY- EVEN THOUGH THIS BILL THE- DO IT SO I THINK THE BILL WAS THE RIGHT. NOW BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO A THE IT'S TO MOTIVATE. I THINK OVER TIME WARM. THIS BE DONE RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S THERE. THAN IN THE WORLD. IF THIS IS A MOTIVE. AFTER A WHILE BILL NEED TO BE USE. BECAUSE IT BE RE CARILLO. CAL POLY PERSONAL BE WORKING WITH THEM AS WELL. ALTHOUGH THERE'S GOT TO BE AWARE POINT CALPERS HAS A LITTLE RESPONSE. HERE BUT THOSE GUY. ARE ONES ARE PROVIDE THE IN. THAT FIVE YEAR LATER RESULT TO. THAT THAT IS A MAJOR PAY BACK AND LOWER AND BASED ON A DECISION SOMEBODY MADE TO RETIRE SO. I THINK THIS IS THE BEST OF A NUMBER OF ALTERNATIVES AND MY HOPE WOULD BE. THAT OVER TIME THIS WOULD NEED TO BE USED BECAUSE OF THE FORCING THE RIGHT DECISION TO BE MADE AND HOW IT'S REPORTED AND HOW IT'S DONE SO. WHENEVER WE GET TO A POINT THAT WE ALLOW MOTION CALL VOTE ON. THE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR LAYERED THE I JUST WANT TO I'M SO TO THE ISSUE OF CALL HAVING SOME AND RISK TO MAYBE THAT GOES BEYOND THIS BILL BUT I'M ALSO INTO TO SOME THE BILL IT IT THE- MOVES THE BALL QUITE. FOR DOWN THE FIELD IN TERMS OF. THE RIGHT THING TO DO SO THAT'S- IN CENTER NEW INYO I'M VERY VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE- A SIMILAR INSPIRE- SO THIS IS A GOOD BILL THIS DOES. NOT FINE DID GO TO BE IN ONCE IN A- THE IT THIS YEAR BECAUSE IT DOES RAY KLAY. UPON THE ALL SHOULD AND IN WHICH NOT- PENALIZED THE- PARTICULAR THE RETURN FOR HAVING- THE CHOIR DENNIS INTO THAT WERE BARKING IN GOOD. YEAH AND TO YOUR POINT SINCE EARLIER THAT SIX WHAT WE'RE HERE AND I THINK OVER TIME- IF THE LOCAL ENTITY THE CALPERS HAVE THE OUT THEY WILL THINK. LONG AND HARD ABOUT TO TELL FIX FOR AND WE WILL THAT SO YOU FOR THIS BILL SENATE LEYVA. THANK YOU SIR ROOF THERE'S NOTHING- SO LABOR WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE WITH A. THERE'S A STRENGTH IN THE NUMBERS. WE POINTED OUT ONE MISTER SUPERSPORT OUT ONE- ISSUE THEY'VE BEEN SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE PEOPLE WHO HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY A SOMEONE WHO SAT ON A PENSION FUND FOR TWELVE YEARS PEOPLE PLAN THEIR LIFE THEY MAKE LIFE DECISIONS BASED ON WHAT THEY ARE TOLD. AND IS NOT THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN THAT THEIR PENSION IS REDUCED IT IS A LIFE CHANGING IN A VERY NEGATIVE WAY TO HAVE TO PAY BACK MONIES AND HAVE YOUR PENSION REDUCED SO THIS BILL WILL PUT MORE ONUS ON CALPERS AND LESS ONUS ON THE WORKER LESS ONUS ON THE PERSON WHO IS RELYING ON THIS AND WORKS TWENTY THIRTY FORTY YEARS. AND KNOW THAT THEY CAN RETIRE AND NOT LIVE IN POVERTY THEY HOPE THIS BILL WILL MAKE SURE THAT THAT HOPE IS A REALITY ADDITIONALLY I JUST WANTED TO- ADDRESS SOMETHING THAT THE GERMAN FROM THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION SAID. HE SAID THAT THIS IS A GIFT OF PUBLIC FUNDS IN THIS IS THE THIRD TIME WE'RE WORKING ON THIS BILL AND I WOULD JUST REALLY LIKE IT IF OPPOSITION WOULD STOP CALLING IT A GIFT OF PUBLIC FUNDS BECAUSE IT IS NOT A GIFT OF PUBLIC FUNDS IT'S JUST NOT FACTUAL THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS LAWFULLY EXECUTED.

THANK YOU MODERATOR OF BACK TO THE COMMITTEE- QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR FURTHER DISCUSSION YES OF MEMBERSHIP. I'VE BEEN VERY TALKATIVE THIS COMMITTEE IT IS OKAY. I DO HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS BEING THAT IT IS MY FIRST- COMMITTEE WERE ACTUALLY DISCUSSING THE BILL'S IN DETAIL IN VOTING ON THEM BUT I DO HAVE A QUESTION. SO RIGHT NOW WITH THE TWELVE YEAR CAP. IT INCENTIVIZES TEACHERS TO KIND OF ROTATED I SEE IT SORT OF. AS TERM LIMITS FOR LEGISLATORS. BECAUSE YOU ARE YOU FRANCE'S YOU RUN FOR TWELVE YEARS MAXIMUM IF YOU'RE IN THE SENATE RIGHT NOW AND THEN YOU HAVE NEW VOICES COMING IN YOUR LIFE EXPERIENCES. WITH THE CAP RIGHT NOW IS THAT EXIST IT ACTUALLY INCENTIVIZES. ROTATION OF LEADERSHIP IN THE UNIONS AND IT ALLOWS FOR NEAR VOICES RECENT VOICES HAVE BEEN IN THE CLASSROOM TO COME IN AND REPRESENT THEIR THEIR MEMBERSHIP. SOME A LITTLE CONCERNED DO YOU SEE THAT BEING GAY AND ALSO BECAUSE I SEE IT AS- AN INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE TO STAY. IN LEADERSHIP FOR LONGER SORT OF LIKE CONGRESS VERSUS THE STATE LEGISLATURE. IN A WAY AND IT IT JUST SENT TO VICE'S NEW LEADERSHIP NEW VOICES COMING IN AND LEADING THE BARGAINING UNITS WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT SENATOR GREAT QUESTION. SO THEY'RE TWO DIFFERENT BECAUSE UNIONS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE THIS WILL ONLY AFFECT A PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYEES PART OF IT IS FAIRNESS BECAUSE THESE ARE THE ONLY- PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYEES THAT ARE GIVEN A CAP. AS I STATED IN MY OPENING ALL THE OTHER UNIONS AND PUBLIC SECTOR DON'T HAVE A CAP SO THEY CAN PULL SOMEONE OUT FOR AS LONG AS THEY WISH. AND EVERY EVERY- BARGAINING UNIT IS DIFFERENT IT'S VERY DIFFERENT PUBLIC SECTOR VERSUS PRIVATE SECTOR PRIVATE SECTOR WE DO A SHORTER AMOUNT OF TIME AND WE PULLED THE ROTATION IS THERE. AND PUBLIC SECTOR PEOPLE TEND TO STAY A LITTLE LONGER AND IT'S A WAY TO KEEP PEOPLE IN AN ALMOST HALF HOUR IF NOT ALMOST BUT HAVE A CAREER. IN THE LABOR MOVEMENT REPRESENTING WORKERS AND IS SOMEONE WHO WORK IN THE LABOR MOVEMENT FOR THIRTY YEARS AND REPRESENT WORKERS FOR TWENTY OF THOSE YEARS. THE MORE TIME YOU HAVE BEEN THE BETTER THOSE CONTRACTS CAN BE VERY COMPLEX AND VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND SO I SEE HAVING MORE THAN TWELVE YEARS AS A BENEFIT. ROTATING LEADERSHIP YEAH IT COULD BE GOOD SOMETIMES YOU BRING SOMEONE IN BRAND NEW WHO HAS NO IDEA- MAYBE. WHAT THE CONTRACT IS THIS IS A WAY TO CREATE SOME KIND. AND AS IT LOW I SAID. IN THESE EDUCATORS ARE THE ONLY ONES FOR LEFT OUT OF THIS. OKAY THANK YOU OTHER COMES TO QUESTIONS. THE C. NONE. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. DONT SEE NONE SENATE WHICH ARTICLES RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR THE BILL INCINERATOR OF MOVES THE BILL OF THE MOTIONS TO PASS THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MEMBERS. WELCOME CENTER STERN THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE- IN ACCOMMODATIONS TODAY- TO THE GENERAL LITTLE BIT OUT OF ORDER YOU MAY PRESENT YOUR BILL SB TWO EIGHTY FOUR. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND CONGRATULATIONS ON A- FIRST HEARING HERE- HONORED TO BE BRINGING THIS BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY IT'S A IT'S A HEAVY SUBJECT- WHEN I WORKED ON FOR A FEW YEARS HERE- AROUND POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS INJURIES AND YOU KNOW WE INITIALLY AFTER GOING THROUGH. SOME REALLY TRAUMATIC FIRES AND- I MASS SHOOTING IN MY DISTRICT A FEW YEARS BACK STARTED LOOKING AT THE IMPACT THAT THESE KINDS OF INCIDENTS WERE HAVING ON THE- FIRST RESPONDERS OF ALL KINDS- AND LOOKING AT HOW WORKERS COMPENSATION ACCOUNTS FOR THE KINDS OF INJURIES. THAT THOSE WORKERS HAVE AS A MATTER OF COURSE IN THEIR BUSINESS- IN THEIR WORK THAT THEIR WORK HAS INHERENTLY DRAMATIC QUALITIES TO IT THEY REALLY MAKE PUTTING THE BURDEN ON THE WORKER TO PROVE THAT THEY'VE GONE THROUGH SOME POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS INJURY- THAT THAT BURDEN WHEN IT IS ON THE BACK OF THE WILL THE WORKERS DOING THE WORK- IS SIMPLY- INCONTROVERTIBLE YEAR OPPOSED TO HOW. THE WORK ITSELF IS DONE BUT ALSO DETERS AND STIGMATIZES THIS KIND OF TRAUMA AND MAKES PEOPLE BURY THEIR INJURIES AND DO WE REALLY GOING TO CHANGE THAT SO SB FIVE FORTY TWO A FEW YEARS BACK WAS OUR ATTEMPT TO REALLY START TURNING THAT BY ESTABLISHING A PRESUMPTION- THAT WHEN A FIREFIGHTER POLICE OFFICER OTHER SORT OF CLASSIFICATIONS OF FIRST RESPONDERS ARE FILING FOR WORKERS COMP FOR POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS INJURY THAT. THE PRESUMPTION IS THAT THEY'RE TELLING THE TRUTH I'M IN THE BURDENS ON THE EMPLOYER TO PROVE THAT THEY'RE NOT AWARE IS UNDER THE CURRENT UNDER PREVIOUS LAW IT WAS QUITE THE OPPOSITE SO TODAY WE'RE BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD TO FRANKLY FILL SOME GAPS THAT WE LEFT. IN THAT LEGISLATION- EVERYONE FROM. NINE ONE I. TO CERTAIN. OF PEACE OFFICERS WHO- ALSO IN KURT EQUALLY DRAMATIC WORK ON THE FRONT LINES- FIREFIGHTERS- FOLKS WHO WORK IN OUR STATE HOSPITAL SYSTEM- AND FORMER SOCIALS- DEPARTMENT GOT DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. PARK RANGERS- AND SO HOPEFULLY THIS LEGISLATION REMEDIES HE THE BIG GAP IN CURRENT LAW WE'RE WE'RE NOT APPLYING ONLY A STANDARD THAT IS IN PLACE BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT. NATURE THESE PERFECT. SO YOU KNOW I MEAN IT'S GONNA DO A WORSE JOB THAN OUR LEAD WITNESSES HERE AND- THEIR STORY- SO I HOPE PEOPLE LISTEN IN AN I KNOW YOU'RE BUSY BUT LET ME ARREARS AND UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN SOMEONE'S ON THE OTHER END OF THAT NINE ONE ONE PHONE CALL. OR YOU ENGAGE WITH THAT YOU KNOW THAT FIREFIGHTER OR SOMEONE YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT OF ONE OF THE STATE HOSPITAL IN A- NECK. ED TRAUMATIC EVENT- THAT THOSE ARE REAL PEOPLE HAVE TO GO HOME AT NIGHT AND THE SUICIDE RATES- INCIDENCES OF MENTAL HEALTH. AND ADDICTION I'M THESE ARE TOUGH THINGS TO TALK ABOUT BUT WE FRANKLY HAVE TO- IF WE'RE GOING TO STAND UP TO THE PEOPLE STAND UP FOR US. SO I'M HAPPY TO GET INTO I REALLY APPRECIATE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND I AM HAPPY TO GIVE SOME FEEDBACK THERE- THERE WERE SOME ANALOGIES TO. WHAT PEOPLE FACE SAY IN TERMS OF PROVING A NEGATIVE IN TERMS OF- BE CITY- I THINK THIS IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT CASE IN TERMS OF PROVING THE NEGATIVE AROUND THIS TRAUMA BUT- LET ME GET INTO IT INTO A MORE DETAILED MEMBERS WOULD SUGGEST AND- WITH THAT I'LL JUST I'LL PASS IT OVER TO OUR VERY ABLE WITNESSES HERE I KNOW WE'VE GOT- TURNING FROM CSL EA. AS WELL AS- I ONE OF THE LEAD OPERATORS IN THE STATE ON A NINE ONE ONE- AND I THINK WE'RE WE'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY HAVE- ONE OF OUR UNITED PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS AS WELL ALONG WITH THAT SO I'LL TURN IT OVER TO I THINK IT'S RYAN- NAVARRETE- TINA BRAZIL AND- NIKKI.

FOR JUST ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY IF WE AGREE WITH THE AUTHORS RECOGNITION OF THE HONOR AND DISTINCTION IN WHICH PEACE OFFICER SERVE OUR COMMUNITIES AND WE RECOGNIZE THE MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES THAT THESE OFFICERS MAY ENCOUNTER- HERE TODAY RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED SB KENNEDY FOR. IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES MANY INSURANCE COMPANIES WERE UNWILLING ARE VERY RELUCTANT TO PROVIDE INSURANCE PRODUCTS TO PUBLIC AGENCIES THE PUBLIC ENTITY RISK POOLING JPA FOR ESTABLISHING AS A RESULT MANY PUBLIC ENTITIES USE THAT MODEL TO EFFECTIVELY SELL FUND FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION COVERAGE. AND NONPROFIT JPA THE BENEFITS PROPOSED BY SB TWO EIGHTY FOUR OR TAX PAYER FUNDED AND MERIT THOUGHTFUL RUBIO. ALL PRESUMPTIONS EVEN EVEN REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION ESTABLISHING NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE BAR FOR EMPLOYERS TO PROVE AND NEGATIVE THAT. ILLNESS IS NOT WORK RELATED. SB TWO EIGHTY. AND PTSD PRISON CREATED BY SB FIVE FORTY KILL TWO ELECTIVE CLASSIFICATIONS WHICH INCLUDES PEACE OFFICERS THAT OUR INVESTIGATORS WITH THE DENTAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA WORK FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES AND ANY PEACE OFFICERS EMPLOYED BY K. TWELVE PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT AND MANY MORE WERE UNAWARE OF ANY OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS THAT THESE CLASSIFICATIONS MERIT THE ELIMINATION OF STATUTORY CLAIMS REVIEW PROCEDURES. BUT A COMPANY WORKERS COMPENSATION PTSD PRESUMPTION OR THAT THEY'RE EVEN DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY PTSD AND FACT IN INTERNAL REVIEW OF CLAIMS DATA TELLS US THAT PTSD CLAIMS ARE INFREQUENT AND EVERY CLAIM THAT WAS RELATED TO WORK WITH ACCEPTED. AND I'LL THE SITE CLAIMS THAT WERE APPROPRIATE AND MOST CLAIMS DIRECTLY FOLLOWED A DISCIPLINARY ACTION FOR AN OFFICER OVER FILED RIGHT BEFORE RETIREMENT WHICH IT STANDS ONLY INCREASES PENSION BENEFITS FOR AN OFFICER CONFRONTING STIGMA MASS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE PTSD AS AN IMPORTANT POLICY OBJECTIVES WHICH WE SHARE WITH THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS HOWEVER MANDATING AND CHECK TO TAXPAYER FUNDED BENEFITS. GOING ON JOB TITLE IS NOT THE SOLUTION AND IGNORES NECESSARY POLICY AND FISCAL CONSIDERATIONS WE WELCOME THE ADDITIONAL REVIEW BY CATHOLIC THAT WILL BE DISCUSSED BY THE FOLLOWING SPEAKER AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO PARTNER WITH THE AUTHOR AND THEN COMMITTEE ON A BROADER CONVERSATION ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION ELIGIBILITY THAT EXAMINES THE IMPACT THAT SUCH CHANGES WOULD HAVE ON INJURED WORKERS. AND ON LOCAL BUDGETS PRIOR TO FOR THE COVERAGE EXPANSION HOWEVER AT THE TIME WHERE RESPECTFULLY. OPPOSED SB TWO EIGHTY FOUR. THANK YOU MISTER DISABILITY WE HAVE COULD. SMELSER POINT TO TESTIFY UP. IF SO PLEASE ENTER YOURSELF YOU SEE. YEAH THANK YOU MISTER- MEMBERS- MY IS CHASE SCHMELZER HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION ON WORKERS COMPENSATION AND PRISM- THE PUBLIC RISK INNOVATION SOLUTIONS AND MANAGEMENT. SB TWO EIGHTY FOUR OR EXPAND AN EXISTING PRESUMPTION THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWENTY NINETEEN THREE SB FIVE FORTY TWO ALSO BY SENATOR STERN MUCH OF THE CONVERSATION AROUND SB FIVE FORTY TWO WAS FOCUSED ON THE STIGMA CONNECTED WITH SEEKING TREATMENT FOR TRAUMA IS ASSOCIATED WITH PUBLIC SAFETY EMPLOYMENT. HOWEVER THERE IS REALLY NO EVIDENCE- AT THE TIME I PROVIDED THAT WOULD SUBSTANTIATE REALLY IN ANY WAY THAT AN ACTUAL PROBLEM EXISTS WITH THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE WORKERS COMPENSATION WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM. IS MADE OR HOW IT- PROCESSES PTSD CLAIMS- FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. OFFICERS WITH OR WITHOUT A PRESUMPTION. THE SIMPSONS IN THE WORK COMP AND SYSTEM- THEY DON'T REDUCE STIGMAS OR MAKE THE SYSTEM MORE FAIR EQUITABLE FOR EMPLOYEES PRESUMPTIONS SHIFT THE BURDEN OF PROOF SO THAT EMPLOYERS CANNOT EFFECTIVELY. MOVING NON OCCUPATIONAL CLAIMS OUT OF THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM INTO OTHER BENEFITS SYSTEMS. IN THIS CASE- AN EMPLOYER MUCH PROVED THAT PTSD DID NOT ARISE FROM EMPLOYMENT IN OTHER WORDS AS THE ANALYSIS INDICATES. THE LAW WOULD REQUIRE US TO PROVE IN SCIENTIFIC NEGATIVE I WHICH ISN'T ENTIRELY POSSIBLE- AS I MENTIONED PAGE TO THE ANALYSIS AS A REALLY GOOD JOB OF KIND OF WALKING THROUGH THIS DYNAMIC AS IT RELATES TO OUR HEART PRESUMPTION. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT- THE TYPE OF POLICY THAT WE'RE CONSIDERING HERE MAKES IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR EMPLOYERS. I TO REFUTE INJURIES AND ILLNESSES THAT ARE FALSELY OR ARONIE ISLEY CLAIMED AS WORK RELATED- FOR PUBLIC AGENCIES THIS MEANS THAT PUBLIC RESOURCES ARE UNNECESSARILY DIVERTED AWAY FROM PUBLIC BENEFIT- IT'S BEEN OBSERVED IN THE PAST THE PRESUMPTION SHOULD BE. USED INFREQUENTLY AND ONLY WENT BACK BY MEANINGFUL DATA OF THE PRIOR SPEAKER I NOTED THE COMMISSION ON HEALTH AND SAFETY AND WORKERS COMPENSATION IS CURRENTLY CONDUCTING A STUDY. THAT STUDY WAS REQUESTED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER DALY- IT AT THE TIME THAT SB FIVE FORTY TWO- WAS PASSED IN TWENTY NINETEEN. THAT STUDY ASKS A DOZEN VERY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS I CAN HELP THE LEGISLATURE- CONSIDER AN EXPANSION OF THIS POLICY AND THAT INFORMATION JUST ISN'T AVAILABLE YET- WORKERS COMPENSATION IS FOR WORK RELATED INJURIES AND ILLNESSES ONLY. IT'S OT DOESN'T DESIGNED OR INTENDED TO COVER- INJURIES AND ILLNESSES THAT ARE NOT RELATED TO EMPLOYMENT- THE POLICY UNDER CONSIDERATION AND SB TWO EIGHTY FOUR. INAPPROPRIATELY BLURS THAT LINE- AND THEREFORE WEAKENS THE SYSTEM- THERE CONTINUES TO BE NO OBJECTIVE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE POLICY WE ARE THERE FOR A OPPOSED AND. RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR NOTEBOOK TODAY. OKAY YOU THINK FOR TO US- WE- BELIEVE THE COULD- THOSE WHO'D TESTED. AND I DID NOT. ON WE'RE GOING TO GO TO COMMITTEE ROOM ASKING THERE'S ANYONE WHO WISHES TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO S. B. TWO EIGHTY FOUR. IN THE ROOM IS SOLD PLEASE STOP FOR.
