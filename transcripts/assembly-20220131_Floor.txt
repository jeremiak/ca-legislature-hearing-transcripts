ON THE ASSEMBLY THIRD READING FILE. FILE ITEMS FORTY FIVE AND FORTY SIX PASS AND RETAIN. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE UP FILE ITEM. FORTY SEVEN. AB TWO FIFTY SEVEN. IN THE CORPORATION ASSEMBLY BILL TWO FIFTY SEVEN BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER HOLDEN AND OTHERS NOT REALLY THE FOOD FACILITIES AND EMPLOYMENT MR HOLDING YOU MAY OPEN THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. AS A FORMER SMALL BUSINESS FRANCHISE OWNER. I KNOW FIRST HAND THE DIFFICULTIES THAT COME WITH RUNNING A FRANCHISE BUSINESS. THE EXPERIENCE I HAVE HAD AS A FRANCHISEE MOTIVATED ME TO AUTHOR LEGISLATION SUCH AS AB FIVE TWENTY FIVE IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN TO PROTECT FRANCHISEES AGAINST THE ARBITRARY TERMINATION OF THEIR CONTRACTS. THOSE EXPERIENCES PROMPTED ME TO TAKE AUTHORSHIP OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWO FIFTY SEVEN. CALIFORNIA HAS A CHANCE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY AND ADDRESS LONG STANDING ISSUES IN THE FAST FOOD INDUSTRY. BY CREATING A STATEWIDE FAST FOOD SECTOR COUNCIL. DESPITE THE FAST FOOD INDUSTRY IS RAPID GROWTH IN CALIFORNIA'S PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYEES WAGES CONTINUE TO REFLECT SOME OF THE LOWEST IN THE STATE. ADDITIONALLY FAST FOOD WORKERS OFTEN EXPERIENCE WAIT STAFF. ASKMEN UNSAFE WORKPLACE CONDITIONS THAT HAVE BEEN A TESTIFIED BY THE PANDEMIC NUMEROUS LAWS AND REGULATIONS WERE CREATED WITH THE INTENTION OF PROTECTING WORKERS FROM INFECTION AND ALLOWING THEM TO REST AND RECOVER WITHOUT FEAR OF LOSING THEIR LIVELIHOOD. UNFORTUNATELY EMPLOYERS HAVE CONTINUOUSLY FAILED TO INFORM THEIR WORKERS OF THEIR RIGHTS AND HAVE EVEN PRESSURED EMPLOYEES TO CHOOSE BETWEEN WORKING IN UNSAFE CONDITIONS. OR LOSING THEIR JOBS. IN THE MEANTIME WORKERS CONTINUE TO FILE COMPLAINTS AND DOCUMENT VIOLATIONS OF CODED SAFETY MEASURES PUBLIC HEALTH LAWS AND LABOR LAWS. AB TWO FIFTY SEVEN WILL ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BY HOLDING CORPORATE FRANCHISORS ACCOUNTABLE FOR ENSURING FRANCHISEES COMPLY WITH STATUTES THAT EMPLOYERS ARE EXPECTED TO FOLLOW. THIS COMPONENT IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT AS I'M CURRENTLY WORKING ON ASSEMBLY BILL SIX SEVENTY SIX WHICH WILL MAKE AMENDMENTS TO AB FIVE TWENTY FIVE AN INSURER FRANCHISE STORES DO NOT CONTINUE TO CIRCUMVENT CALIFORNIA LAW. AB TWO FIFTY SEVEN WOULD ALSO PROHIBIT RETALIATION AGAINST WORKERS FOR EXERCISING THEIR RIGHTS AND PROTECTING PROTESTING AGAINST UNSAFE WORKING CONDITIONS. SEVERAL HAVE RAISED CONCERNS THAT THIS BILL TAKE AWAY THE LEGISLATURE'S AUTHORITY TO CREATE REGULATIONS IMPACTING THE FAST FOOD INDUSTRY. IT DOES NOT. THE LEGISLATURE. THE SPEAKER. YOU GOT ME WORKING A LITTLE BIT TOO HARD UP HERE. THE LEGISLATURE SIMPLY DIRECT THE COUNCIL TO IMPLEMENT POLICY AND STANDARDS CREATED BY THE LEGISLATURE. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE THE CPUC AND KERR THIS BILL DOES NOT IMPROPERLY DELEGATED LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE IS PERMITTED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE GRANTS THE POWER. TO ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY AS LONG AS SUITABLE TO SAFEGUARDS ARE ESTABLISHED. JUST TO NAME A FEW THE WORKERS COMPENSATION BOARD. OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT ARMINA TALK TO SUBJECT SUBSTANCE IN CONTROL. BERMAN A PESTICIDE REGULATIONS AS I SAID JUST TO NAME A FEW. I HAVE ENGAGED WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND TKEN AMENDMENTS THAT WILL REQUIRE THE COUNCIL TO SUBMIT STANDARDS TO THE LEGISLATURE BEFORE BECOMING REGULATION. GIVEN A SIXTY DAYS TO WEIGH IN AND REQUIRED A PERFORMANCE REVIEW OF THE COUNCIL THREE YEARS. AMONG OTHER AMENDMENTS AND YET I'M STILL OPEN TO TIGHTENING UP. THE BILL WHERE APPROPRIATE. FOR EXAMPLE I AM OPEN TO EXTENDING THIS REVIEW PERIOD TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS. I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS SURROUNDING FRANCHISE OR FRANCHISEE JOINT LIABILITY. I'M AWARE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WITH THE APPROACH HOWEVER I WANT TO ASSURE MEMBERS THAT THE SPONSORS AND I REMAIN COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING CONCERNS AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD. MEMBERS IN THE SENATE MAY HAVE SIMILAR RESERVATIONS SO WE WILL CONTINUE CONSIDERING AMENDMENTS. THAT IMPROVE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FRANCHISE STORE IN FRANCHISEE. WHILE MAINTAINING ADEQUATE PROTECTION FOR WORKERS WILLINGNESS TO ADDRESS CONCERNS JUST AS RECENTLY AS LAST WEEK BY REMOVING THE COUNCIL'S AUTHORITY TO ISSUE SUBPOENAS. I'VE HEARD THE CONCERNS OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH ADMINISTRATORS AND I'VE TAKEN THEM SERIOUSLY. I'M ADDRESS THEIR TO CONCERNS REGARDING ENFORCEMENT OUT OF THEIR JURISDICTION. WE WILL WORK TO ADDRESS THEIR REMAINING CONCERNS REGARDING NOTIFICATIONS I'M HAPPY TO CONTINUE DISCUSSING A REASONABLE WAY TO ADDRESS FRANCHISE OR RESPONSIBILITY IN THESE MATTERS THIRTY SECONDS HOLDEN I'M ALSO HAPPY TO ADDRESS TO DISCUSS HOW WE CAN ENSURE GEOGRAPHICAL DIVERSITY. ON THE COUNCIL SO THAT BOTH RURAL AND URBAN FRANCHISEES ARE HEARD. THIS BILL IS ABOUT CREATING EQUITY AND INCLUSION FOR FAST FOOD WORKERS AND FRANCHISEES I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU MR HOLDER MISTER COOLEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. COLLEAGUES I RISE AGAIN IN OPPOSITION THIS BILL AYE OPPOSED TO LAST SUMMER I DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE CHANGES MADE. I ACTUALLY DON'T FEEL THEY CURE THE ISSUES OF. AFFECTING THE ABILITY THE LETTER TO RESPOND. HI. THE AUTHOR HAS STATED HE WOULD EXTEND THE REVIEW PER TWO HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS BUT TO GIVE A REVIEW TO THE LEGISLATURE WHO AN ONLY SPEAK TO REGULATIONS BY THE ADOPTION OF STATUTES AND SAVES SIXTY DAYS A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS. THIS IS REALLY A BILL WRITTEN. TO UNDERMINE THE ABOVE THE LEGISLATURE TO HONESTLY WEIGH IN ON THESE ISSUES. AND I'M ACTUALLY CONCERNED THAT AS A MEMBER. I SEE MANY BILLS COMING THROUGH. WHERE WE DO TO OURSELVES THIS WE PASS BILLS. THAT UNDERMINE THE POWER OF THE LEGISLATURE EXEMPT THINGS ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT. HI OUR HANDS WE CAN ONLY OFFER COMMON SIXTY DAYS WHEN THEY HAVE TO HAVE A BILL. THERE IS ONLY ONE BODY OF LINE CALIFORNIA WERE SIXTY DAY WINDOW ACTUALLY IS USEFUL THE LEGISLATURE TO WEIGH IN. AND THAT'S IN THE LONG. STATE REORGANIZATIONS WHICH IS FOUND IN THE CONSTITUTION. OF THE REORG LOG GOVERNOR CAN BRING FOR THE PLAN AND ANY EVEN A SINGLE HOUSE THE LEDGER COULD OBJECT TO IT WITHIN SIXTY DAYS AND IS DEAD. THAT IS NOT WHAT WE HAVE HERE. WE HAVE RULES BEING BROUGHT FOR JUSTICE FOR THE LOST AWAY AND OFFER A COMMENT. BUT WITH A SIXTY OR A HUNDRED TWENTY DAY IT IS JUST NOT WELL FOUNDED RESPONSES A BODY I RICHARD I'VE OR UNTIL. THANKS COOLEY. MR SAY ARE TELL YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY I TO STAND IN OPPOSITION OF AB TWO FIFTY SEVEN LABOR LAWS THAT AFFECT ALL ALL BUSINESSES INCLUDING FAST FOOD THE FAST FOOD INDUSTRY. AND IF SOMEONE WHO GOT HIS START IN A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT. IT'S NOT A FUN JOB BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS A JOB AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE LABOR LAWS AND WE HAD TO FOLLOW THE LABOR LAWS. AS I WAS WHEN I BECAME A MANAGER- ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT BUT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE FRANCHISEES THAT ARE STRUGGLING IT RECOVER FROM THE PANDEMIC. THIS IS NOT A GREAT TIME TO HIT YET ANOTHER UNELECTED BOARD- OVERSEE SPECIFICALLY THEM. AND IN ADDITION TO MANY OF THE OTHER AGENCIES THAT WERE ALREADY POINTED OUT EARLIER. THIS IS THE LIABILITY THAT IS BEING EXTENDED FROM THE FRANCHISOR WILL HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT ON BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE FRANCHISORS BUSINESSES THE FRANCHISEES IN ALIFORNIA AND YOU WILL SEE SOME OF THE MOST POPULAR FRANCHISE FRANCHISES GROW IN OTHER AREAS AND WONDER WHY CALIFORNIA DOESN'T GET TO HAVE THOSE. SO IT ENTER IT JUST DRIVES ENTIRE FRANCHISES. AND FRANCHISE BRANDS AWAY FROM CALIFORNIA. SO IT IS FOR THESE REASONS THAT I ASK YOU TO CAST A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL. AND PROTECT THE FRANCHISEES THAT WE HAVE THE WORKERS HAVE THE PROTECTION THEY NEED THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DR QUIRK YOU ARE RECOGNIZED YES- I REGRETFULLY A RISE IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWO FIVE SEVEN AM I DO REGRET BEING IN OPPOSITION. THERE IS CLEARLY A PROBLEM IN THE FAST FOOD INDUSTRY I JUST DON'T THINK HAVING A SEPARATE SET OF REGULATIONS FOR THE FAST FOOD INDUSTRY IS THE WAY TO DO IT I THINK ENFORCEMENT IS WHAT WE NEED. I THINK THE FRANCHISORS COULD HELP WITH THAT- FOR EXAMPLE THIS GROUP COULD SERVE A SEPARATE MINIMUM WAGE FOR FAST FOOD WORKERS OR FRANCHISE WORKERS. AND WHY SHOULD A FRANCHISE OF WORKERS MAKE MORE THAN THE DISHWASHER TO SIT DOWN RESTAURANT OR CHILD CARE WORKER OR MADE AT A HOTEL. I WISH AND NEWSPAPER STORIES COMPLAINING ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT THAT HAS TO BE FIXED BUT THAT'S ALREADY ILLEGAL. WE DON'T NEED NEW REGULATIONS WE NEED BETTER ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULES WE HAVE. I BELIEVE THAT THE FRANCHISE OR SHOULD HAVE A ROLE IN THEM FOR SHIPMENT. FOR ME TO SUPPORT THE BILL IT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED. TO NOT BRING SEPARATE REGULATIONS. TO WHERE INDUSTRY. BUT TO ENFORCE THE REGULATIONS WE HAVE ON ALL INDUSTRIES AND IN PARTICULAR THERE SHOULD BE A ROLE FOR THE FRANCHISE STORES. WHAT I WOULD SUPPORT HURON THE FRANCHISE OR BE RESPONSIBLE IN SOME WAY FOR THE BEHAVIOR THE FRANCHISEE. THEY INSPECT FOR FOOD QUALITY AND CLEANLINESS THEY CAN EXPECT. HOW WELL THE STAFF IS TREATED. TO THE OFFER I HOPE YOU CAN FIND A WAY TO HELP THE STAFF AND FRANCHISEES I JUST DON'T THINK THIS IS THE WAY TO DO IT. THANK YOU. THANK GOD COR MISTER COOPER. YOUR RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER PHONE CAN IN AUTHOR FOR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS AND IN DOING THE BILL THERE. IN MY OPINION IS NOT WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE REALLY BAD BIG ISSUE IS. BRUTAL LEGISLATURE WE FOUGHT TO GET HERE WITH THE ONE SELECTED FOR THE ONE THAT PEOPLE CALL. IN TO HAVE AN ELECTED BODY. THEY CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT IT JUST DOESN'T SIT RIGHT- I HAVE MY CONSIDER FOR A DAILY BASIS WE HAVE ISSUES. WITH BODY HAS NO REGULATION OVER THEM. YOU MENTIONED CARB NCPC. MANY TIMES ALLEGE THE TRUCK TALK TO CARD ENROLLED. AND GOTTEN ZERO RESPONSE FROM KERR. IT'S MOSTLY SHE'S ON THE C. P. U. C. SO. IT'S FOR. THAT WE'RE GONNA ADVOCATE THAT AND LIKE I SAID- I THOUGHT TO BE HERE. AND THE WAS HARD. IS A LOT OF US HAD A HARD TIME GETTING HERE AND WHY WOULD EVER ADVOCATE AUTHORITY ONE ELSE I JUST CAN'T DO THAT- YOU KNOW IT'S TOUGH BEING LEGISLATURE BUT- THAT'S WHY WE SIGNED UP FOR IT WE'RE NOT. ABOUT A COMPLAINING ABOUT IT THAT'S OUR JOB NOTHING ELSE IS JUMPING ANOTHER BODY MAKING DECISIONS THAT USURP AUTHORITY I JUST CAN'TTHE PORTS THAT'S WHAT MY ISSUE WITH THAT WITH THE WAY THE BILLS RIGHT NOW WITH CHANGES I THINK IT'S WORKABLE. BUT TO GIVE AUTHORITY UP NO NO AT THE END OF THE DAY. A COMPLAIN TO BE MADE AT. THE LEGISLATURE EIGHTY OF US IN HERE AND THAT'S WITH THE BIG ISSUE I JUST CAN'T DO IT SO I CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM. MISS BONTA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER OUR COLLEAGUES I RISE AS A CO AUTHOR OF AB TWO FIVE SEVEN AND THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM PASADENA FOR CONTINUING TO ADVANCE THIS IMPORTANT DISCUSSION THE FAST RECOVERY ACT CONTAINS IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS FOR WORKERS IN THE FAST FOOD INDUSTRY ACCORDING TO THE LABOR CENTER AT UC BERKELEY THERE ARE AN ESTIMATED FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS WHO WORKED IN THE INDUSTRY IN TWENTY NINETEEN. WITH MOST EARNING CLOSE TO MINIMUM WAGE AFTER THE GREAT RECESSION AND THE COVERT NINETEEN INDUCED RECESSION OUR ECONOMY AND THESE JOBS ARE THE SAME AS WHAT MANY OF US ON THE ON THIS FLOOR MAY REMEMBER FROM MY TEENAGE YEARS. 77% ARE OVER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN EIGHT OUT OF TEN ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR SIX OUT OF TEN ARE LATINO TWO THIRDS ARE WOMEN THIS BILL DOESN'T INHERENTLY SET MINIMUM FAST FOOD RESTAURANT EMPLOYMENT STANDARDS WHAT IT DOES IS REQUIRE A NEW COUNCIL WITH THE AYE OUT WITHIN DIR TO DO SO WITH MANDATED OPPORTUNITIES FOR PUBLIC INPUT. HOWEVER THE PROMISE OF STRENGTHENED WORKER PROTECTIONS WITHIN THE FRANCHISEE AND FRANCHISOR INDUSTRY IS AN INVESTMENT AND ECONOMIC FUTURE OF OUR STATE INCREASES IN RENTAL INCOME THE TO HIGHER TEST SCORES BETTER EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN AND IMPROVEMENTS IN CHILDREN'S HEALTH. ORDING TO OTHER RESEARCH. INCREASES THE AS THESE ALSO IN OUR ADULT MEN HEALTH INCLUDING THE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN SUICIDE RATES. I'M A STRONG PROPONENT OF GREEN MINING AND BUILDING WEALTH EQUITABLY FOR CALIFORNIANS. ADDRESS HISTORICAL DIVESTITURE IN BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES. I BELIEVE AB TWO FOUR SEVEN WILL HELP US DO THAT BY STRENGTHENING PROTECTIONS AGAINST WEALTH EXTRACTION. FROM FRANCHISEES AND WORKERS ALIKE THAT IS PERVASIVE IN THIS INDUSTRY AS WRITTEN BY GEORGE TALKING FASTER. MR CHAT IN. FAST FOOD WORKERS WERE ALWAYS ESSENTIAL AND THE PANDEMIC HAS BROUGHT THAT MORE INTO STARK RELIEF. AS THEY CONTINUE TO SERVE OUR COMMUNITY THROUGH A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. ALEX I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB TWO BY SEVEN. THANK YOU RESPOND MYSTERY THIS. YOUR RECORD. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE TODAY AS A JOIN AUTHOR OF AB TWO FIFTY SEVEN. THE FAST FOOD ACCOUNTABILITY AND STANDARDS RECOVERY ACT. A BILL URGENTLY NEEDED TO EMPOWER AND PROTECT OUR ESSENTIAL WORKERS WORKING AT FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS MANY OF THEM ARE VERY OWN CONSTITUENTS. FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS OF THE PANDEMIC. THIS CHAMBER HAS HONORED THE WORK AND SACRIFICES OF CALIFORNIA'S ESSENTIAL WORKERS. IF WE FAIL TO PASS AB TWO FIFTY SEVEN TODAY. WE TURN A BLIND EYE TO MORE THAN HALF A MILLION FAST FOOD WORKERS. IN OUR STATE WHO REMAIN ON THE FRONT LINES TO OUR COMMUNITIES. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC CALIFORNIA'S FAST FOOD WORKERS HAVE WAGED MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED STRIKES. SOUNDING THE ALARM ON UNSAFE WORKING CONDITIONS AND TODAY IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO HEAR THEM. TO DO SOMETHING FOR THESE WORKERS WE CAN'T WRITE OFF. THESE AS MERELY PUBLICITA STARTS THESE STRIKES ARE INDICATIVE. OF WORKERS REACHING THEIR BREAKING POINT AND CHOOSING TO TAKE ACTION. AND OF COURSE RISKING RETALIATION BY THEIR EMPLOYER TO IMPROVE THEIR SAFETY OUT WORK. THESE WORKERS HAVE EXHAUSTED NEARLY EVERY OPTION AVAILABLE TO THEM. YET THE SYSTEM HAS FAILED THEM. BUT WE SHOULD INFILL THEM TODAY. THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING FOR A GROUP. HALF A MILLION AST FOOD WORKERS THAT NEED OUR VOICE. THIS IS WHY I WAS ELECTED. FOR THE TWO TO REPRESENT THEM MANY OF THEM MY OWN CONSTITUENTS AND THEY'RE NOT TEENAGERS LIKE- THE MEMBER FROM OAKLAND MENTIONED THEIR- THIRTY YEAR OLD WOMEN. THAT ARE PROVIDING FOR THEIR FAMILY THROUGH THIS JOB AND NOT GET IT NOT HAVING ALL THE RIGHTS THAT THEY DESERVE IN THEIR WORK. BRINGING WORKERS TO THE TABLE THROUGH AB TWO FIFTY SEVEN IS THE BEST WAY FOR REGULATORS TO TAP THEIR FRONTLINE EXPERIENCES TO CREATE BETTER STANDARDS FOR THIS INDUSTRY GIVING WORKERS A VOICE THROUGH AB TWO FIFTY SEVEN IS THE BEST WAY TO EMPOWER WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN ORGANIZING IN THE STATE FOR NEARLY NINE YEARS. EMPOWERING OUR FAST FOOD WORKERS TO THE TABLE. IS THE BEST WAY TO HONOR AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE SACRIFICES THEY HAVE MADE AS A CENTRAL FRONT LINE WORKERS THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE KOREA. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS- AS A PRO JOINT AUTHOR AND FORMER ACTUALLY MCDONALD'S EMPLOYEE WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT FOR AB TWO FIVE SEVEN THE FAST FOOD ACCOUNTABILITY AND STANDARDS ACT THERE ARE HALF A MILLION FAST FOOD WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA YET THEY ARE SOME OF THE LOWEST PAID. AND LEAST PROTECTED ESSENTIAL WORKERS IN OUR STATE LIKE SO MANY SERVICE AND CARE JOBS FAST FOOD WORKERS PREDOMINANTLY DONE BY BLACK LATINO AND IMMIGRANT WORKERS IN THIS INDUSTRY 80% OF THE WORKFORCE ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR AND 60% ARE LATINOS. THE FRONT LINE THESE FRONTLINE WORKERS HAVE FACED DIRE CONDITIONS DURING THE PANDEMIC WORKERS WERE GIVING DOGGIE DIAPERS HAS FACED MASS FORCED TO WORK SICK AND EVEN FIRE WHEN THEY DEMANDED BETTER COPE WITH SAFETY PROTOCOLS THERE WAS AN ARTICLE THAT JUST CAME OUT A FEW DAYS AGO WHERE A FAST FOOD WORKER WAS TOLD BY THEIR MANAGER EVEN IF YOU TEST POSITIVE FOR COALBED DON'T TELL ANYONE WEAR A MASK AND COME TO WORK. FOR YEARS CALIFORNIA FAST FOOD WORKERS HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR IMPROVED CONDITIONS IN THEIR INDUSTRY WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND I WORKED AT MCDONALD'S I HAD THIRTY NINE CENT CHEESEBURGERS THROWN AT ME BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT AT THE SATISFACTION OF THE CUSTOMER I HAD MY LIFE THREATENED I MY COLLEAGUES AND I WOULD HAVE TO FACE THESE TYPES OF CONDITIONS EVERY DAY WHETHER IN THE DRIVE THRU OR WHETHER. INSIDE THE RESTAURANT I TELL YOU FROM EXPERIENCE THAT THESE WORKERS ARE SOME OF THE HARDEST. WORKING PEOPLE THAT I HAVE EVER WORKED WITH. AND THE QUESTION SHOULDN'T BE WHY IS A FAST FOOD WORKER EARNING MORE THAN ANOTHER WORKER IN ANOTHER INDUSTRY THE QUESTION SHOULD BE WHY IS INCOME INEQUALITY SO PREVALENT ACROSS OUR NATION AND OUR STATE. THAT DEMANDS THAT WE ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING AND TAKE ACTION SO THE PEOPLE CAN LIVE IN DIGNITY IN THEIR OWN NEIGHBORHOODS IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES. THIS LEGISLATION CREATES A MECHANISM TO RAISE OVERALL STANDARDS AND PROTECTIONS TO THE FAST FOOD INDUSTRY. THROUGH INPUT FROM FRONTLINE WORKERS AND FAST FOOD EMPLOYERS IF WE ARE TO ACHIEVE A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL THEN WE MUST FIND INNOVATIVE WAYS TO PROTECT AND EMPOWER. THE HALF MILLION FAST FOOD WORKERS IN OUR STATE COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS CARRILLO. C. NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE ITEM MR HOLDEN YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER OF ALL I APPRECIATE. THOSE WHO I STOOD UP AND ENSURE THEIR CONCERNS- I THINK THERE'S NOT ONE CONCERN THAT WAS RAISED MAYBE NOT SPOKEN OUT. THAT WE HAVE NOT I HAVE NOT. HEARD AND HAVE NOT GIVEN A COMMITMENT. TO WORK TO ADDRESS. WE TALK ABOUT CONTROL LEGISLATURE. AND SOMEHOW WE'RE BY TAKING THIS ACTION ABDICATING OUR RESPONSIBILITY. I WOULD JUST ASK. YOU TO THINK AND REFLECT. YOU KNOW WITH THEGAMBLING CONTROL COMMISSION. WHAT DECISIONS ARE THEY MAKING RIGHT NOW. YOU KOW WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL. WHAT DECISIONS ARE THEY MAKING WHAT POWER HAVE YOU ALREADY ADVOCATED FOR THEM. AND HUNDREDS MORE. THEIR DECISIONS ARE GOING TO BE OVERLOOKED. LIKE THIS PARTICULAR COUNCIL TALK ABOUT OVERSIGHT. YOU GOT MORE ON THIS COUNCIL THEN YOU DO A HUNDREDS OF OTHERS THE MANY OF YOU MAY NOT EVEN KNOW WHAT DECISIONS THEY'RE TAKING RIGHT NOW AND WHAT POWERS THEY ARE USING THAT YOU GAVE. AND RIGHTFULLY SO. WE CAN'T MANAGE IT ALL. WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO ADDRESS PEOPLE. WHO KEEP FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS. YOU'RE TRYING TO USE THESE ARE FOLKS THAT THEY CAN'T EVEN GET. PLACE BECAUSE OF THE FRAGMENTED INDUSTRY. TO WHERE THEY CAN ORGANIZE AND HAVE A LABOR YOU. YOU DID. WHEN YOU HAVE THAT PROTECTION YOU HAVE SOMEONE TO MUSLIMS THE CITY FRANCHISE OR YOU'RE NOT TREATING ME RIGHT. I'M NOT GOING TO BE WORKING IN AN ENVIRONMENT WITH A PANDEMIC AND NOT HAVE ALL THE PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT THAT I NEED TO DO MY JOB. AND BE HEALTHIER SAID. SO WHAT WE DO. NORICK. WE ALREADY KNOW THE HIERARCHY OF A FRANCHISE OPERATION. FRANCHISE ZORA AND WHOEVER ELSE. THEY SAY JUMP. FRANCHISEE SAYS HOW HIGH. THE WORKER IS CAUGHT BECAUSE OF A FRANCHISEE. IS BEING TOLD WHAT TO DO AND HOW TO DO IT OR WHAT NOT TO DO. THE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO THE WORKER. THIS IS TRYING TO FILL THAT GAP. THIS IS TRYING TO ADDRESS A COUPLE WEEKS AGO WE CELEBRATE DR KING'S BIRTHDAY. REMEMBER A TIME WHEN PEOPLE WANTED TO WORK. BUT THEY WANTED TO HAVE BASIC RIGHTS THEY WANTED TO BE ABLE TO GO TO A JOB AND BE PROUD. NOW I'M NOT GOING TO SAY. THAT EVERY FRANCHISEE AND EVERY FRANCHISE WORST DYNAMIC. IS BAD. THERE ARE SOME OUTSTANDING FRANCHISEES. I TALKED TO ONE. BALTIMORE AND I PLAN ON TALKING TO MORE. WEWERE TALKING ABOUT THEIR EMPLOYEES AS FAMILY AND I BELIEVE THEM. BUT JUST UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE OTHERS WHO CLEARLY ARE NOT. AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO STEP IN AND CREATE A SYSTEM THAT AT LEAST GIVE THEM A SHOT. ARE YOU CUT OUT NO. WE MADE AMENDMENT SAYS THAT IT COMES BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE. THE COMMITTEE WILL HAVE A PUBLIC HEARING BICAMERAL PUBLIC WEIGHING IN. WILL HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THEY'LL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW AND DECIDE IF THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE OR NOT. THEY CAN WRITE A BILL AS A COMMITTED. BUT WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT EXTENDING THE TIME FOR IT. IF THAT IS AN AREA CONCERNING MEMBERS. I ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT THIS BILL. BECAUSE IT IS ABOUT FAIRNESS. AND IT IS ABOUT BRINGING ALL THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES TO THE TABLE TO COLLABORATE ON SOLUTIONS THIRTY SECONDS WAS ALL THE. I THINK THIS BILL MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE FOR A LOT OF FOLKS OUT THERE. WHO MANY OF THEM. OR FREE THE STEP OUT AND LET THEIR VOICES BE HEARD BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO LOSE. OTHER JOB. RESPECT LAST RIVAL. AND WITH THAT. CARCLUB THE ROLE.

IN THE MIDDLE OF BEST AND THAT'S IF YOU LOOK AROUND YOU SEE OBVIOUSLY NOT THESE PEOPLE A LOT OF LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. YOUR POLICE AND SHERIFFS AND ALL THE THIS WEEKEND. AND MOST THE MEN AND WOMEN WEAR VESTS BECAUSE A LOT OF WE'RE GETTING. BACK ISSUES THE GUN AWAY FROM THE GUN BILL THESE DAYS SO. THE GUNS IN THE CENTER THAT BEST AND THAT'S WHEN TRYING TO GET THIS BILL WILL NOT CONFLICT WITHOUT OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO CARRY THEIR WEAPONS OKAY PASSED. IT ON MY OWN TIME JUST I MEAN WE HAD ONE INCIDENT WE KNOW ABOUT- I CARRIED A GUN FOR A LONG TIME THIRTY YEARS I CARE TO TASER. AND IT'S. ONE OF THOSE THINGS WERE- SO MESSED UP AND DID MISTAKE. IT WAS A DUMB MISTAKE- EVERYONE DOESN'T DO THE THERE WORKING THAT'S- STREETS AND DOING THAT IT'S- OFFICERS WHERE THEY'RE SET UP. WHAT FEELS MOST COMFORTABLE THEM. THOSE LITTLE THINGS WERE THROWN OUT BABY WITH THE BATH WATER- IT JUST IT JUST CONCERNS ME WITH THAT- SO A LOT OF FOLKS HAVE DIFFERENT SET UPS FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS AND- I'M NOT SURE IF BECAUSE WE'VE HAD. ONE INCIDENT THAT WAS THE INTENT ON TV BUT- FOLKS GO DAY IN AND DAY OUT AND USE BOTH THEIR WEAPONS AND NEVER HAD THE ISSUE WITH THAT.
