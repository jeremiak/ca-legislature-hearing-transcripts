00:21:33.759 --> 00:21:35.093
ONE OF THE CONCERNS I HAVE

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.663
RIGHT HERE IS THAT WE ARE

00:21:37.729 --> 00:21:41.633
CREATING- IN A POSITION. THAT

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.669
PERHAPS ONE OF THE WORST TIMES

00:21:43.735 --> 00:21:45.303
THAT WE COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:48.106
FINANCIALLY. NOW BASED ON THE

00:21:48.173 --> 00:21:50.275
REPORT THAT I READ HERE IS THAT

00:21:50.342 --> 00:21:52.711
THIS WOULD. RUN ABOUT TWENTY

00:21:52.778 --> 00:21:55.147
MILLION DOLLARS TO BE

00:21:55.213 --> 00:21:57.749
IMPLEMENTED. WE ARE REELING

00:21:57.816 --> 00:22:02.220
FROM. THE VIRUS PANDEMIC WE

00:22:02.287 --> 00:22:03.922
DON'T UNDERSTAND THE FULL

00:22:03.989 --> 00:22:06.458
BREADTH AND COST OF HAVING TO

00:22:06.525 --> 00:22:09.928
CONVERT TO DISTANCE LEARNING.

00:22:09.995 --> 00:22:12.431
WE HAVE ADJUNCT FACULTY THROUGH

00:22:12.497 --> 00:22:15.434
OUR C. ISSUE SYSTEM THERE ARE

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.769
LIKELY GOING TO BE PUT ON ICE

00:22:17.836 --> 00:22:20.739
IN WE ARE ON CLEAR THE RATE OF

00:22:20.806 --> 00:22:23.041
ATTRITION. AND THOSE STUDENTS

00:22:23.108 --> 00:22:24.609
WHO MAY NOT COME BACK GIVEN

00:22:24.676 --> 00:22:27.145
WHAT THE NEW BRICK AND MORTAR

00:22:27.212 --> 00:22:29.214
EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES LIKE.

00:22:29.281 --> 00:22:31.483
ALL THIS USE AN EXAMPLE ON MY

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:32.651
HAPPENED AND I HAD THE HONOR OF

00:22:32.718 --> 00:22:34.720
REPRESENTING FRESNO STATE ONE

00:22:34.786 --> 00:22:37.589
OF THE C. ISSUES. THE SHORTFALL

00:22:37.656 --> 00:22:40.225
RIGHT NOW IS ALREADY THIRTEEN

00:22:40.292 --> 00:22:42.561
MILLION DOLLARS. AND THAT WAS A

00:22:42.627 --> 00:22:45.630
WHILE BACK. YOU ADD THAT TO THE

00:22:45.697 --> 00:22:47.099
FACT THAT WE DON'T KNOW HOW

00:22:47.165 --> 00:22:48.233
MANY STUDENTS WILL BE COMING

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:50.102
BACK WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE

00:22:50.168 --> 00:22:51.803
SPORTS PROGRAM AND WHAT IMPACT

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:53.538
THAT MIGHT HAVE ON FOUNDATION

00:22:53.605 --> 00:22:56.108
FUNDING IN OTHER RELATED TO-

00:22:56.174 --> 00:23:00.045

00:23:00.112 --> 00:23:01.880
WE ARE CREATING A SITUATION.

00:23:01.947 --> 00:23:04.216
THAT IS I THINK IT IT'S HARD

00:23:04.282 --> 00:23:06.318
BASED ON EDUCATION IN COULD BE

00:23:06.384 --> 00:23:09.521

STUDENTS BUT WE'RE CHOOSING THE

00:23:12.858 --> 00:23:17.395
ABSOLUTE WORST TIME TO CREATE.

00:23:17.462 --> 00:23:19.898
A IN A POSITION LIKE THIS IT'S

00:23:19.965 --> 00:23:21.166
ALMOST AS IF THIS WOULD BE

00:23:21.233 --> 00:23:22.734
BETTER SUITED IT THIS COULD

00:23:22.801 --> 00:23:24.669
COME BACK IT'LL AT A LATER DATE

00:23:24.736 --> 00:23:27.773

RACIAL INJUSTICES THAT CONTINUE

00:31:54.379 --> 00:31:56.714
IN OUR SOCIETY. THAT IS WHY WE

00:31:56.781 --> 00:31:57.615
HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

IT WAS SPOKEN EARLIER. MAYBE

00:38:49.794 --> 00:38:52.163
THE MOST TROUBLESOME ASPECT OF

OVER THE YEARS. OF THEM

00:49:15.686 --> 00:49:19.923
NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS. TO A

00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:20.390
ACTUALLY ELIMINATE THE

00:49:38.475 --> 00:49:41.011
OVER THE YEARS BECAUSE IT WAS

00:49:41.078 --> 00:49:44.247
NOT CONSIDERED A CORD APARTMENT.

00:49:44.314 --> 00:49:45.482
THERE WERE NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS

00:49:45.549 --> 00:49:46.883
EVERY TIME THERE WAS A BUDGET

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:50.921
PROBLEM. LIKE WE HAVE NOW. TO

00:49:50.987 --> 00:49:52.522
ELIMINATE OR REMOVE THE

00:49:52.589 --> 00:49:55.225

00:49:55.292 --> 00:49:58.495
A VERY PROUD HERITAGES OUT OF

00:49:58.562 --> 00:50:04.401
THE STATE. WITH DOCTOR GALARZA.

00:50:04.468 --> 00:50:06.737
CREATING THE DEPARTMENT AT SAN

00:50:06.803 --> 00:50:12.109
JOSE STATE. AND I'M ROSE. THE

00:50:12.175 --> 00:50:14.044
EMPHASIS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF

00:50:14.111 --> 00:50:17.881
SOCIAL WORKERS- THOUSANDS OF

00:50:17.948 --> 00:50:19.216
SOCIAL WORKERS AND GRADUATED

00:50:19.282 --> 00:50:22.419
THERE. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

00:50:22.486 --> 00:50:29.960
TEACHERS. PSYCHOLOGY. EVEN

00:50:30.026 --> 00:50:32.129
URBAN STUDIES POLITICAL SCIENCE

00:50:32.195 --> 00:50:39.035
LIKE MYSELF. GRADUATE DEGREES.

00:50:39.102 --> 00:50:42.873
IN THE HUMANITIES AND ARTS.

00:50:42.939 --> 00:50:44.307
BECAUSE THIS IS PARTIALLY ABOUT

00:50:44.374 --> 00:50:46.443
THAT ALSO WAS ABOUT NOT JUST

00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:48.378
HISTORY IT'S ABOUT. YOU'RE

00:50:48.445 --> 00:50:52.616
LEARNING ABOUT. HUMANITIES AND

00:50:52.682 --> 00:50:56.019
ARTS. AND WE HAVE A PROBLEM

00:50:56.086 --> 00:50:57.954
DEPARTMENT- THAT TEACHES THAT

00:50:58.021 --> 00:50:59.389
THAT'S WITH THOSE DEPARTMENTS

00:50:59.456 --> 00:51:03.693
TEACH. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:05.028
THESE DEPARTMENTS IN THIS DAY

00:51:05.095 --> 00:51:06.930
AND AGE OR ESSENTIAL THERE

00:51:06.997 --> 00:51:09.933
SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED. LIKE

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.101
THE MOST RECENT TIME THEY CALL

00:51:11.168 --> 00:51:13.036
THEY TALKED ABOUT SCALING BACK

00:51:13.103 --> 00:51:14.971
THE DEPARTMENT. IT ACTUALLY

00:51:15.038 --> 00:51:17.107
WASN'T THAT LIKE TWENTY YEARS

00:51:17.174 --> 00:51:17.741
AGO IT WAS ONLY LIKE FIVE YEARS

00:51:17.808 --> 00:51:20.010
AGO. THEY TRIED TO ELIMINATE

00:51:20.076 --> 00:51:24.915
THE DEPARTMENT FIVE YEARS AGO.

00:51:24.981 --> 00:51:27.484
AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. THAT'S

00:51:27.551 --> 00:51:33.590
A PATTERN EVERY TIME EVERY TIME

00:51:33.657 --> 00:51:35.892
THERE'S A BUDGET PROBLEM THEY

00:51:35.959 --> 00:51:37.427
ALWAYS LOOK AT THE PARCHMENTS

00:51:37.494 --> 00:51:38.662
THAT OR NOT THE COURT

00:51:38.728 --> 00:51:41.631
APARTMENTS. THE REPEAT THE

00:51:41.698 --> 00:51:43.633
MANDATED DEPARTMENTS FOR YOUR

00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:45.602
BASIC EDUCATION AND THEY

00:51:45.669 --> 00:51:50.040
PROPOSED TO ELIMINATE OF. AND I

00:51:50.106 --> 00:51:50.574
DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT I

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:53.610
THINK THE DEPARTMENT. SHOULD

00:51:53.677 --> 00:51:56.713
HAVE THE STATUS. OF A

00:51:56.780 --> 00:52:00.350
DEPARTMENT THAT'S ESSENTIAL TO

00:52:00.417 --> 00:52:03.820
THE UNIVERSITIES BEING. WHICH

00:52:03.887 --> 00:52:06.957
IS THE WAY ACTUALLY THE

00:52:07.023 --> 00:52:09.226
STUDENTS LOOK AT THE DEPARTMENT.

00:52:09.292 --> 00:52:10.727
YOU TALK TO THE STUDENTS THEY

00:52:10.794 --> 00:52:11.828
THANK FIFTIES DEPARTMENTS ARE

00:52:11.895 --> 00:52:14.764
ESSENTIAL WHEN THEY WALK BY. SO

00:52:14.831 --> 00:52:17.200
THE STATE THE TWENTY FIVE FOOT

00:52:17.267 --> 00:52:21.104
HIGH STATUE OF. TOMMY SMITH AND

00:52:21.171 --> 00:52:23.840
JOHN CARLOS. THERE WE HAVE IT

00:52:23.907 --> 00:52:26.810
SET OUT OF THE STATE. AND

00:52:26.877 --> 00:52:29.579
REMEMBER THE HERITAGE. OF OUR

00:52:29.646 --> 00:52:32.449
UNIVERSITY THEY HAPPEN TO BE

00:52:32.516 --> 00:52:34.818
ONE I WENT TO SCHOOL THERE WHEN

00:52:34.885 --> 00:52:37.921
THESE DEPARTMENTS WERE PARADED.

00:52:37.988 --> 00:52:38.788
AND THE STRUGGLE SURGE PARADE

00:52:38.855 --> 00:52:43.126
ON. GIVEN THE FACT THAT. THE

00:52:43.193 --> 00:52:47.697
PROTESTS RESULTED IN. THE

00:52:47.764 --> 00:52:49.232
REACTION OF POLITICIANS TO

00:52:49.299 --> 00:52:50.700
ELIMINATE THOSE DEPARTMENTS AT

00:52:50.767 --> 00:52:55.572
THAT TIME. SO IT SEEMS TO ME IT

00:52:55.639 --> 00:53:00.210
SEEMS TO ME. THAT WE HAVE TO

00:53:00.277 --> 00:53:01.745
REALLY LOOK AT WHAT REALLY IS

00:53:01.811 --> 00:53:05.382
GOING ON HERE. IF WE REALLY

00:53:05.448 --> 00:53:08.285
WANT TO MAKE THIS A CORE. OF

00:53:08.351 --> 00:53:11.221
OUR UNIVERSITY AND A CORE OF

00:53:11.288 --> 00:53:12.822
OUR EDUCATION OF THE TEACHERS

00:53:12.889 --> 00:53:14.958

00:53:17.494 --> 00:53:19.195
HERE IN THIS BUILDING OF THE

00:53:19.262 --> 00:53:20.397
PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR LOCAL

00:53:20.463 --> 00:53:22.666
GOVERNMENT. THE HEALTH CARE

00:53:22.732 --> 00:53:26.536

00:53:26.603 --> 00:53:29.005
HAPPENS EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT

00:53:29.072 --> 00:53:30.974
THE CULTURAL COMPETENCY SHOULD

00:53:31.041 --> 00:53:34.077
BE A- BASIC NORM. IN OUR

00:53:34.144 --> 00:53:38.181
SOCIETY. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE

00:53:38.248 --> 00:53:39.816
OUGHT TO HAVE THE STUDENTS TO

00:53:39.883 --> 00:53:43.887
GET DEGREES IN. POLICE IN ALL

00:53:47.157 --> 00:53:50.026

COMPETENCY IN OUR STUDENTS. AND

THAT'S HALF THE CHALLENGE AND

00:55:33.329 --> 00:55:34.564
WE HAVE SO MANY DEBATES ON THE

00:55:34.631 --> 00:55:36.266
FLOOR SO MANY TIMES THAT NOW IS

00:55:36.332 --> 00:55:38.068
THE NOT THE RIGHT TIME LET'S

00:55:38.134 --> 00:55:39.636
COLLECT DATA WE DON'T HAVE THE

00:55:39.703 --> 00:55:43.673
MONEY. AND THIS IS OUR EFFORT

00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:45.775
TO POUR INTO THE FUTURE OF

00:55:45.842 --> 00:55:48.378
CALIFORNIA INFORMATION SO WE

00:55:48.445 --> 00:55:51.681
CAN GET BEYOND. ON THE NEED TO

00:55:51.748 --> 00:55:54.184
RE EDUCATE THE MAJORITY.

00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:56.786
TEMPORARILY ARM ABOUT THE

00:55:56.853 --> 00:55:58.655
EXPERIENCES OF PEOPLE OF COVER

00:55:58.722 --> 00:55:59.656
EVERY TIME THAT THERE'S A

00:55:59.723 --> 00:56:02.392
CHALLENGE IT IS A CONVERSATION

00:56:02.459 --> 00:56:02.926
WE HAVE TO START FROM THE

00:56:02.992 --> 00:56:05.061
BEGINNING. THIS IS AN

00:56:05.128 --> 00:56:06.863
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:56:06.930 --> 00:56:07.997
THE FUTURE LEADERS OF OUR GREAT

00:56:08.064 --> 00:56:12.869
STATE- ARE BETTER THAN WE ARE.

00:56:12.936 --> 00:56:16.272
THAT'S MY HOPE. MY HOPE IS THAT

00:56:16.339 --> 00:56:18.041
THESE GRADUATING STUDENTS WILL

00:56:18.108 --> 00:56:20.610
COME ON AND BE THE FUTURE

00:56:20.677 --> 00:56:22.612
LEADERS THE FUTURE CORPORATE

00:56:22.679 --> 00:56:24.581
LEADERS BUSINESS LEADERS AND SO

00:56:24.647 --> 00:56:26.282
WE CAN STEP AWAY FROM HAVING TO

00:56:26.349 --> 00:56:27.984
HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND

00:56:28.051 --> 00:56:30.820
VALIDATING WIDE DIVERSITY HELPS

00:56:30.887 --> 00:56:32.422
YOUR BUSINESS WHY DIVERSE

00:56:32.489 --> 00:56:35.658
CAMPUS. IS HEALTHY FOR THE NEXT

00:56:35.725 --> 00:56:39.996
GENERATION OF LEADERS. THE

00:56:40.063 --> 00:56:41.631
CATALOG OF OFFERINGS IS NOT THE

00:56:41.698 --> 00:56:44.634
ISSUE. ALTHOUGH I WAS INTRIGUED

00:56:44.701 --> 00:56:45.769
TO SEE CHICO STATE IN THEIR

00:56:45.835 --> 00:56:47.704
DIVERSITY- REQUIREMENTS AT A

00:56:47.771 --> 00:56:53.176
COURSE ENTITLED. HEALTH AT

00:56:53.243 --> 00:56:56.012
EVERY SIZE A NON DIET APPROACH

00:56:56.079 --> 00:56:58.982
TO WELLNESS. SO WHEN WE TALK

00:56:59.048 --> 00:57:00.884
ABOUT DIVERSITY VERSES ETHNIC

00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:02.285
STUDIES THERE'S A DIFFERENCE

00:57:02.352 --> 00:57:02.886
THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL

00:57:02.952 --> 00:57:05.421
DIFFERENCE AND WHAT WE ARGUING

00:57:05.488 --> 00:57:08.358
IS THE IMPORTANCE OF A SPECIFIC

00:57:08.424 --> 00:57:11.294
CONVERSATION AROUND RACE THAT'S

00:57:11.361 --> 00:57:13.062
WHAT ETHNIC STUDIES BRINGS TO

00:57:13.129 --> 00:57:17.801
THE TABLE. BECAUSE I.

00:57:17.867 --> 00:57:19.536
APPRECIATE BUT I PROBABLY COULD

00:57:19.602 --> 00:57:20.703
HAVE BENEFITTED FROM THE HEALTH

00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:21.971
EVERY SIZE AND ON THAT APPROACH

00:57:22.038 --> 00:57:23.339
TO WELLNESS AND PERHAPS SHOULD

00:57:23.406 --> 00:57:25.875
HAVE TAKEN IT- AND THEIR PEOPLE

00:57:25.942 --> 00:57:26.943
I'M SURE WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM

00:57:27.010 --> 00:57:29.979
THAT BUT LET'S NOT CONFUSE THE

00:57:30.046 --> 00:57:31.481
IMPORTANT VALUE OF

00:57:31.548 --> 00:57:33.349
CONVERSATIONS AROUND DIVERSITY

00:57:33.416 --> 00:57:35.418
WITH A CORE CURRICULUM ABOUT

00:57:35.485 --> 00:57:37.387
ETHNIC STUDIES THERE IS A

00:57:37.453 --> 00:57:39.556
DIFFERENCE. AND I WOULD ARGUE

00:57:39.622 --> 00:57:42.158
THAT THERE IS SPACE IN OUR

00:57:42.225 --> 00:57:45.795
UNIVERSITY SYSTEM BY BOTH. I

00:57:45.862 --> 00:57:47.363
APPRECIATE THAT ARE CSU SYSTEM

00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:48.698
MAY BE ONE OF THE DIVERSE MOST

00:57:48.765 --> 00:57:50.834
DIVERSE IN THE WORLD BUT LET'S

00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:52.302
BE CLEAR COMPARED TO WHAT

00:57:52.368 --> 00:57:54.037
HIGHER ACADEMIA IS ONE OF THE

00:57:54.103 --> 00:57:56.339
LEAST THE FIRST. SECTORS IN THE

00:57:56.406 --> 00:58:00.143
WORLD. AND SO IT MAY BE ONE OF

00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:01.144
THE MOST DIVERSE BUT IS IT

00:58:01.211 --> 00:58:03.646
TRULY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE

00:58:03.713 --> 00:58:06.182
MOST DIVERSE STATE. THE OTHER

00:58:06.249 --> 00:58:08.418
CHALLENGE IS PIPELINE ISSUES

00:58:08.484 --> 00:58:09.185
YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS AN

00:58:09.252 --> 00:58:11.421
UNDERGRAD ALBEIT A MILLION

00:58:11.487 --> 00:58:13.857
YEARS AGO. MOST OF THE TENURED

00:58:13.923 --> 00:58:17.193
PROFESSORS THAT WE LOOK TO AS

00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:19.462
EXAMPLES THAT WE COULD GO TO

00:58:19.529 --> 00:58:22.131
FOR GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT. WERE

00:58:22.198 --> 00:58:22.599
IN THE ETHNIC STUDIES

00:58:22.665 --> 00:58:24.234
DEPARTMENTS. MY COLLEAGUE FROM

00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:26.803
SAN JOSE IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:28.438
THE MINUTE THAT THERE IS ANY

00:58:28.504 --> 00:58:30.640
KIND OF FINANCIAL UP A

00:58:30.707 --> 00:58:32.175
CHALLENGE TO UNIVERSITY THOSE

00:58:32.242 --> 00:58:33.910
DEPARTMENTS ARE DOWNGRADED TO

00:58:33.977 --> 00:58:35.945
PROGRAMS THEY DON'T BACK FEEL

00:58:36.012 --> 00:58:38.014
VACANCIES BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A

00:58:38.081 --> 00:58:40.149
TENURE TRACK FOR PROFESSORS AND

00:58:40.216 --> 00:58:41.718
SO WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO MAKE

00:58:41.784 --> 00:58:43.887
IT. A DIVERSE INSTITUTION AND

00:58:43.953 --> 00:58:46.623
BE ABLE TO HIRE FROM WITHIN

00:58:46.689 --> 00:58:48.458
THERE IN LIES THE PROBLEM. I'M

00:58:48.524 --> 00:58:49.626
NOT SURE HOW ANY OF US CAN

00:58:49.692 --> 00:58:51.895
GUARANTEE OR BE CONFIDENT ABOUT

00:58:51.961 --> 00:58:54.931
WHAT ANOTHER APPOINTED BODY

00:58:54.998 --> 00:58:56.633
WILL DO. FIND OUT. WHAT I DO

00:58:56.699 --> 00:58:58.968
KNOW IS WHAT'S WHAT A SIGNAL

00:58:59.035 --> 00:59:02.005
THIS WILL SEND. TO THE BOARD OF

00:59:02.071 --> 00:59:03.072
TRUSTEES OF THE CALIFORNIA

00:59:03.139 --> 00:59:05.074
LEGISLATURE SAYS THIS IS SO

00:59:05.141 --> 00:59:06.910
IMPORTANT FOR ALL THE REASONS

00:59:06.976 --> 00:59:09.112
STATED BY MY COLLEAGUES THAT WE

00:59:09.178 --> 00:59:10.613
ARE WILLING TO SET THE

00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:12.048
PRECEDENT BY MAKING IT A

00:59:12.115 --> 00:59:14.017
MANDATE I AM CLEAR WHAT KIND OF

00:59:14.083 --> 00:59:15.652
SIGNAL THAT WILL SEND TO THE

00:59:15.718 --> 00:59:17.887
TRUSTEES IN THEIR DELIBERATIONS

00:59:17.954 --> 00:59:20.523
THEY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO

00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:22.625
THIS FOR YEARS. AND HAVE FAILED.

00:59:22.692 --> 00:59:24.093
ANSEL VOTE TODAY WILL ALLOW THE

00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:25.461
BILL TO STAY ALIVE AND

00:59:25.528 --> 00:59:27.697
HOPEFULLY- SEND A STRONG SIGNAL

00:59:27.764 --> 00:59:29.232
ABOUT OUR EXPECTATIONS ABOUT

00:59:29.299 --> 00:59:31.901
THE CORE VALUE. OF THIS KIND OF

00:59:31.968 --> 00:59:34.137
EDUCATION I'LL BE SUPPORTING

00:59:34.203 --> 00:59:36.306
MAYBE FOURTEEN SIXTY TODAY.

00:59:36.372 --> 00:59:37.807

BRADFORD FOR BRINGING THIS

00:59:59.896 --> 01:00:01.297
FORWARD IT CERTAINLY LONG

01:00:01.364 --> 01:00:03.633
OVERDUE THE TIME IS NOW YOU'VE

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:06.135
HEARD THIS MANY TIMES- BUT THIS

01:00:06.202 --> 01:00:09.872
IS REALLY. A BILL THAT WILL NOT

01:00:09.939 --> 01:00:11.474
ONLY PREPARES FOR THE NEXT

01:00:11.541 --> 01:00:12.775
GENERATION OF LEADERS THIS IS A

01:00:12.842 --> 01:00:15.144
BILL PRODUCED AND WANTED AND

01:00:15.211 --> 01:00:17.146
NEEDED BY OUR STUDENTS MOST OF

01:00:17.213 --> 01:00:19.082
WHICH TERMINATE MINORITY

01:00:19.148 --> 01:00:20.583
STUDENTS. ACCORDING TO THE

01:00:20.650 --> 01:00:23.286
NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION

01:00:23.353 --> 01:00:25.054
STUDENTS WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY.

01:00:25.121 --> 01:00:27.490
WITH DEEP STRUCTURE STRUGGLE

01:00:27.557 --> 01:00:28.925
AND PERSEVERANCE AND THEY DID

01:00:28.992 --> 01:00:30.893
BETTER WHEN THEY DID. STUDENTS

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:32.161
WHO IDENTIFIED LITTLE WITH

01:00:32.228 --> 01:00:34.297
THEIR OWN ETHNIC GROUP ACHIEVED

01:00:34.364 --> 01:00:36.766
POORLY. OVERWHELMING DOMINANCE

01:00:36.833 --> 01:00:38.001
OF EURO AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES.

01:00:38.067 --> 01:00:39.635
THE MANY STUDENTS TO DISENGAGE

01:00:39.702 --> 01:00:41.104
FROM CREATIVE ARE I'M SORRY

01:00:41.170 --> 01:00:43.039
FROM ACADEMIC LEARNING. IT'S

01:00:43.106 --> 01:00:46.075
NOT JUST AN ACADEMIC VALUE IT'S

01:00:46.142 --> 01:00:47.944
A SOCIAL VALUE INVALUABLE. AND

01:00:48.011 --> 01:00:50.613
JUST AS WE SOUGHT TO IMPORTANT-

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:53.016
SUPREME COURT DECISIONS LGBT Q.

01:00:53.082 --> 01:00:54.717
AMERICANS WERE PROTECTED IN THE

01:00:54.784 --> 01:00:56.986
WORKPLACE AND DHAKA'S. DREAMERS

01:00:57.053 --> 01:00:59.055
WERE PROTECTED WE WANT TO BE

01:00:59.122 --> 01:01:00.623
ABLE TO SEE THOSE DECISIONS IN

01:01:00.690 --> 01:01:04.660
OUR HISTORY BOOKS. OVERALL THIS

01:01:04.727 --> 01:01:06.095
PROVIDES A SPACE MINORITY

01:01:06.162 --> 01:01:08.598
STUDENTS FEEL THEIR HERITAGE

01:01:08.664 --> 01:01:10.967
HOUSE WORTH. YES WE KNOW THE

01:01:11.034 --> 01:01:12.535
IMMIGRATION AND STRUGGLES WITH

01:01:12.602 --> 01:01:14.170
IMMIGRATION AND STRUGGLES

01:01:14.237 --> 01:01:16.039
WITHIN JUST AS SLAVERY ARE PART

01:01:16.105 --> 01:01:18.174
OF THAT HISTORY THEY ALSO NEED

01:01:18.241 --> 01:01:20.343
TO KNOW THAT THE SUCCESSES OF

01:01:20.410 --> 01:01:20.910
OUR LEADERS ARE PART OF THAT

01:01:20.977 --> 01:01:23.446
HISTORY TO. IN ADDITION THE

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:25.048
INTERSECTION ALLEY OF WOMEN OF

01:01:25.114 --> 01:01:28.151
COLOR WHO ARE OFTEN NOT IN

01:01:28.217 --> 01:01:30.086
THESE BOOKS AND OVERLOOKED. IN

01:01:30.153 --> 01:01:33.990
PAID LESS AND NOT EVEN VISIBLE

01:01:34.057 --> 01:01:34.590
IN THESE BOOKS SHOULD ALSO BE

01:01:34.657 --> 01:01:37.260
INCLUDED. SO WITH THAT I WANT

01:01:37.326 --> 01:01:38.895
TO SAY THANK YOU AGAIN I ASK

01:01:38.961 --> 01:01:40.229
YOU COLLEAGUES TO MAKE THIS A

01:01:40.296 --> 01:01:42.899
VERY IMPORTANT PRIORITY FOR US

01:01:42.965 --> 01:01:44.600
WE DON'T MAKE THIS DECISION NOW

01:01:44.667 --> 01:01:46.169
IT'S THAT SENDS A CLEAR MESSAGE

01:01:46.235 --> 01:01:48.838
THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR

01:01:48.905 --> 01:01:53.676
GONZALEZ CENTER LEYVA. THANK

01:01:53.743 --> 01:01:55.478
YOU MISTER PRESIDENT GOOD

01:01:55.545 --> 01:01:58.247
MORNING MEMBERS- I RISE IN

01:01:58.314 --> 01:02:00.650
STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL

01:02:00.716 --> 01:02:02.585
WHEN I FIRST WANT TO THANK THE

01:02:02.652 --> 01:02:05.054
AUTHOR- DOCTOR WEBER HAS BEEN

01:02:05.121 --> 01:02:07.123
TENACIOUS ON THIS ISSUE AND

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:08.157
I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE OF

01:02:08.224 --> 01:02:09.759
HEARING BILL SIMILAR TO THIS

01:02:09.826 --> 01:02:10.393
SINCE I'VE BEEN ON THE

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:11.994
EDUCATION COMMITTEE FOR THE

01:02:12.061 --> 01:02:13.763
LAST SIX YEARS. MEMBERS WE CAN

01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:15.465
ALWAYS FIND A WAY NOT TO DO

01:02:15.531 --> 01:02:17.200
SOMETHING THAT'S THE EASIEST

01:02:17.266 --> 01:02:19.235
THING TO DO IS TO SAY NO AND WE

01:02:19.302 --> 01:02:21.170
CAN MAKE EXCUSE AFTER EXCUSE

01:02:21.237 --> 01:02:23.473
AFTER EXCUSE. WHAT'S HARD TO

01:02:23.539 --> 01:02:25.408
DO. IS FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE DO

01:02:25.475 --> 01:02:27.443
THE RIGHT THING. THIS IS AN

01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:29.078
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO DO THE

01:02:29.145 --> 01:02:32.949
RIGHT THING. IT IS LONG OVERDUE.

01:02:33.015 --> 01:02:34.383
WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE COST IN

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:35.918
THAT THE IN THE UNIVERSITIES

01:02:35.985 --> 01:02:38.821
CAN'T WIN KERR THE COSTS NOW.

01:02:38.888 --> 01:02:39.689
WELL I THINK WE CAN ALWAYS

01:02:39.755 --> 01:02:41.424
BLAME COSTS EVEN THOUGH WE ARE

01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:43.192
IN A GOING INTO A RECESSION NOW

01:02:43.259 --> 01:02:44.660
BUT I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE COST

01:02:44.727 --> 01:02:46.829
OF DOING NOTHING. IS MORE

01:02:46.896 --> 01:02:48.898
EXPENSIVETHAN THE COST OF

01:02:48.965 --> 01:02:51.467
IMPLEMENTING THIS. WE ALL LEARN

01:02:51.534 --> 01:02:53.703
WHAT WE LIVE AT HOME AND GUESS

01:02:53.769 --> 01:02:56.105
WHAT. SOMETIMES RACISM IS TOP

01:02:56.172 --> 01:02:57.039
RIGHT THERE IN SOMEONE'S LIVING

01:02:57.106 --> 01:02:59.208
ROOM. SO IF WE DON'T HAVE AN

01:02:59.275 --> 01:03:00.276
OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR YOUNG

01:03:00.343 --> 01:03:02.512
PEOPLE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:03:02.578 --> 01:03:05.014
HOPE FOR THE FUTURE. TO LEARN

01:03:05.081 --> 01:03:07.283
ABOUT OTHER ETHNICITIES HOW DO

01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:09.819
WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS WORLD.

01:03:09.886 --> 01:03:11.821
I DON'T KNOW I DON'T SEE THAT

01:03:11.888 --> 01:03:13.556
WHEN WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER

01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:14.790
WERE MOR ACCEPTING OF EACH

01:03:14.857 --> 01:03:16.692
OTHER WHEN WE UNDERSTAND EACH

01:03:16.759 --> 01:03:18.794
OTHER WE REALIZE WE HAVE MORE

01:03:18.861 --> 01:03:21.197
IN COMMON. THAN NOT. AND I HAVE

01:03:21.264 --> 01:03:24.200
TO ALSO SAY THAT DIVERSITY IN

01:03:24.267 --> 01:03:24.667
ETHNIC STUDIES FOR TWO

01:03:24.734 --> 01:03:26.135
DIFFERENT THINGS. AND I HAVE

01:03:26.202 --> 01:03:30.239
TO. STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH MY

01:03:30.306 --> 01:03:32.241
COLLEAGUE FROM A RENDA. ANIM

01:03:32.308 --> 01:03:33.843
SOMEWHAT OFFENDED WHEN HE

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:35.611
APPLIED THE PEOPLE ON HIS SIDE

01:03:35.678 --> 01:03:36.812
OF THE AISLE. WHICH I'M NOT

01:03:36.879 --> 01:03:37.847
SURE WHAT WAS ON THE SAME SIDE

01:03:37.914 --> 01:03:39.515
OF THE AISLE. THAT WE ARE

01:03:39.582 --> 01:03:41.484
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A SITUATION

01:03:41.551 --> 01:03:43.352
TO VOTE ON THIS. YOU KNOW WHAT

01:03:43.419 --> 01:03:45.054
I'VE SUPPORTED ETHNIC STUDIES

01:03:45.121 --> 01:03:46.956
SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE WE

01:03:47.023 --> 01:03:48.925
HAVE WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW

01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:51.894
RIGHTLY SO IN THE STREETS. I'D

01:03:51.961 --> 01:03:53.496
ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT YES THE

01:03:53.563 --> 01:03:56.399
UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS IN JANUARY.

01:03:56.465 --> 01:03:58.267
CAME OUT WITH THIS IDEA THAT

01:03:58.334 --> 01:03:59.769
THEY'RE GOING TO DO IN ETHNIC

01:03:59.835 --> 01:04:02.171
STUDIES BUT WHAT. PEOPLE FAIL

01:04:02.238 --> 01:04:04.140
TO MENTION IS THAT THREE YEARS

01:04:04.207 --> 01:04:06.008
AGO THE C. ISSUES DID A STUDY

01:04:06.075 --> 01:04:08.044
THEIR OWN STUDY AND CONCLUDED

01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:09.512
THAT THEY NEEDED TO ADD ETHNIC

01:04:09.579 --> 01:04:12.014
STUDIES. TO THEIR CURRICULUM

01:04:12.081 --> 01:04:14.250
THEY DIDN'T DO IT I WOULD ARGUE

01:04:14.317 --> 01:04:15.184
THAT THE ONLY REASON THEY'RE

01:04:15.251 --> 01:04:17.353
DOING IT NOW OR SAY THEY'RE

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:18.521
GOING TO DO IT. IS BECAUSE OF

01:04:18.588 --> 01:04:19.889
DOC RIVERS BILL BECAUSE OF THIS

01:04:19.956 --> 01:04:21.591
BILL SO WE CAN'T LET THEM OFF

01:04:21.657 --> 01:04:23.893
THE HOOK. I LOVE OR RC ISSUES

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:25.127
AND I THINK THEY DO FABULOUS

01:04:25.194 --> 01:04:28.331
WORK. BUT SOMETIMES THEY HAVE

01:04:28.397 --> 01:04:29.365
TO BE PUSHED A LITTLE BIT. I

01:04:29.432 --> 01:04:30.800
THINK WE CAN WORRY ABOUT

01:04:30.866 --> 01:04:32.969
PRESIDENT. BUT SOMETIMES. IF WE

01:04:33.035 --> 01:04:34.837
JUST HIDE BEHIND THAT. WE DON'T

01:04:34.904 --> 01:04:36.806
GET THE RIGHT THING DONE. SO

01:04:36.872 --> 01:04:40.042
MANY IN WAS SOMETHING. FOR

01:04:40.109 --> 01:04:40.910
THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE VISUAL

01:04:40.977 --> 01:04:42.912

THE REASON I ASK YOU TO WATCH

THAT MOVIE IS BECAUSE IT'S

01:04:54.357 --> 01:04:56.325
BASED ON A TRUE STORY AND WHEN

01:04:56.392 --> 01:04:57.526

LEGISLATURE WEIGHING IN ON ON

01:07:38.287 --> 01:07:40.122
THE ISSUE OF EDUCATION IN OUR

01:07:40.189 --> 01:07:45.127

THAT SO I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT

01:07:48.964 --> 01:07:50.833
THAT BUT MOSTLY. MY MAIN

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:52.368
CONCERN OF OUR UNIVERSITIES AND

01:07:52.435 --> 01:07:54.437
I'VE OFTEN ASKED THIS. OF THE

01:07:54.503 --> 01:07:56.539
LEADERS OF OUR UNIVERSITIES AND

01:07:56.605 --> 01:07:57.039
ASKED THEM WHAT S YOUR

01:07:57.106 --> 01:08:00.042
MISSION. DO YOU HAVE A MISSION

01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:01.277
WHAT IS YOUR PRIMARY MISSION IF

01:08:01.343 --> 01:08:04.313
YOU WERE TO DESCRIBE WHAT YOU

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:06.715
ARE THERE TO DO AND THE

01:08:06.782 --> 01:08:10.152
UNIVERSITY. WHAT IS IT. OFTEN I

GET DIFFERENT RESULTS RESPONSES

01:08:12.154 --> 01:08:14.256
AND THAT OFTEN CONCERNS ME.

01:08:14.323 --> 01:08:15.825
BECAUSE WHEN INDIVIDUALS

01:08:15.891 --> 01:08:17.460
RUNNING OUR UNIVERSITIES DON'T

01:08:17.526 --> 01:08:19.495
AGREE ON WHAT THEIR MISSION IS.

01:08:19.562 --> 01:08:20.463
THERE ARE GENERALLY GOING TO

01:08:20.529 --> 01:08:22.298
GET DIFFERENT OUTCOMES AND I'VE

01:08:22.364 --> 01:08:25.434
HEARD THINGS FROM TO- MAKE

01:08:25.501 --> 01:08:27.102
BETTER PEOPLE OF OUR STUDENTS

01:08:27.169 --> 01:08:29.405
TO. PROVIDE THEM WITH A BETTER

01:08:29.472 --> 01:08:33.876
FUTURE. A GENERAL ANSWERS. AND

01:08:33.943 --> 01:08:37.746
I ALWAYS RESPOND. WITH WITH A

01:08:37.813 --> 01:08:40.082
QUESTION OF SHOULDN'T WE HAVE

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:42.284
VERY CLEAR GOALS SET OUT OF OUR

01:08:42.351 --> 01:08:44.253
UNIVERSITY SO WE KNOW WHAT THE

01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:46.522
GOAL IS SO THAT WE CAN MEASURE

01:08:46.589 --> 01:08:47.156
WHETHER WE'RE ACCOMPLISHING OUR

01:08:47.223 --> 01:08:50.159
GOAL. AND I ALWAYS ASK HIM

01:08:50.226 --> 01:08:52.294
ISN'T OUR GOAL TO CREATE OF OUR

01:08:52.361 --> 01:08:54.663
STUDENTS. CRITICAL THINKERS AND

01:08:54.730 --> 01:08:55.564
WHAT IS A CRITICAL THINKER

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:57.233
SOMEBODY THAT CLEARLY

01:08:57.299 --> 01:08:57.867
UNDERSTAND THE SCIENTIFIC

01:08:57.933 --> 01:09:00.536
METHOD. SOMEBODY THAT KNOWS

01:09:00.603 --> 01:09:01.904
WHAT IT IS AND HOW TO EMPLOY IT.

01:09:01.971 --> 01:09:03.372
BECAUSE OF THE SCIENTIFIC

01:09:03.439 --> 01:09:05.040
METHOD THAT'S HOW WE HAVE. OF

01:09:05.107 --> 01:09:09.411
PUT UP. OF PEOPLE ON THE MOON.

01:09:09.478 --> 01:09:11.747
INTO SPACE HOW WE HAVE BUILT

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:15.484
SKYSCRAPERS AND- A MAKE UP AN

01:09:15.551 --> 01:09:19.722
AIRPLANE FLY. AND IF WE ARE

01:09:19.788 --> 01:09:21.023
PREPARING CALIFORNIANS TO BE

01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:23.993
CRITICAL THINKERS. THEY WILL BE

01:09:24.059 --> 01:09:25.361
ABLE TO ANSWER EVERY QUESTION

01:09:25.427 --> 01:09:28.430
ON THEIR OWN. AND SO I HAVE

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:29.765
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WORK OUR

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:31.300
UNIVERSITIES ARE DOING AND I

01:09:31.367 --> 01:09:33.068
HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT

01:09:33.135 --> 01:09:34.937
OUR OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY THAT

01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:37.306

COUPLE OF WEEKS HAVE A LOT OF

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:27.836
STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT NOT ONLY

THE ISSUE WE'RE DEBATING TODAY

01:13:30.906 --> 01:13:33.108
BUT SO MANY OF THE THINGS THAT.

CATHOLIC SCHOOL HERE IN

01:13:43.819 --> 01:13:46.388
CALIFORNIA IN MY RELIGION CLASS

01:13:46.455 --> 01:13:48.724
WHEN WE LEARNED ABOUT THE MARK

01:13:48.791 --> 01:13:51.693
ON CAIN. CAME THE BROTHER WHO

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:54.196
KILLED ABLE. WELL MY TEACHER

DIDN'T SAY IT. EXPLICITLY IT

01:13:58.467 --> 01:14:01.036
WAS HINTED AND I UNDERSTOOD AND

01:14:01.103 --> 01:14:03.205
THEN LATER AT SOME POINT AT THE

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:05.107
DINNER TABLE IN MY FAMILY. THE

01:14:05.174 --> 01:14:08.243
IMPLICATION WAS THAT BLACK

01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:11.914
PEOPLE ARE DESCENDANTS OF CAIN

01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:14.783
THE MARK OF CAIN WAS ON BLACK

01:14:14.850 --> 01:14:16.585
PEOPLE THEY'RE BLACK SKIN WAS

01:14:16.652 --> 01:14:20.122

01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:22.891
WHAT IT'S- THE CURRENT

01:14:22.958 --> 01:14:24.893
REFERENCE. SOME TRADITIONAL

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:26.862
BIBLICAL RELIGIOUS

01:14:26.929 --> 01:14:28.897
INTERPRETATIONS CONSIDER CAME

01:14:28.964 --> 01:14:30.699
TO BE THE ORIGINATOR OF EVIL

01:14:30.766 --> 01:14:34.303
VIOLENCE FOR FREE. THIS IS JUST

01:14:34.369 --> 01:14:36.839
ONE EXAMPLE OF THE SUBTLE.

01:14:36.905 --> 01:14:39.741
EXPLICIT AND OTHERWISE

01:14:39.808 --> 01:14:43.879
PERVASIVE WAYS MY GROWING UP AS

01:14:43.946 --> 01:14:46.748
A WHITE AMERICAN STEEP TO ME IN

01:14:46.815 --> 01:14:49.985
ACCEPTING AN NOT QUESTIONING

01:14:50.052 --> 01:14:53.121
SYSTEMIC RACISM I DID NOT EVEN

01:14:53.188 --> 01:14:55.023
UNDERSTAND IT. NOTE THE WORD

01:14:55.090 --> 01:14:58.627
TRADITION THROUGHOUT MY GROWING

01:14:58.694 --> 01:15:00.829
UP AS AN AMERICAN WHICH

01:15:00.896 --> 01:15:02.598
UNFORTUNATELY I THINK IS STILL

01:15:02.664 --> 01:15:05.934
TRUE TODAY. AMERICAN CULTURAL

01:15:06.001 --> 01:15:08.437
TRADITIONS BECAUSE THOSE

01:15:08.503 --> 01:15:09.872
CULTURAL TRADITIONS WERE

01:15:09.938 --> 01:15:12.908
DEVELOPED BY WHITE AMERICANS

01:15:12.975 --> 01:15:18.046
EXPLICITLY REINFORCE RACISM.

01:15:18.113 --> 01:15:20.015
AGAINST NATIVE AMERICANS

01:15:20.082 --> 01:15:22.985
AGAINST BLACKS AGAINST LACK

01:15:23.051 --> 01:15:25.821
NECKS. AND STE SO MANY OTHERS

01:15:25.888 --> 01:15:28.757
IN REINFORCE THE CANE STORY

01:15:28.824 --> 01:15:32.961
WITHOUT EXPLICITLY SAYING IT.

01:15:33.028 --> 01:15:35.597
NOW ADMITTEDLY MY SECOND GRADE

01:15:35.664 --> 01:15:37.599
WAS A LONG TIME AGO AND I

01:15:37.666 --> 01:15:40.168
CERTAINLY HOPE THAT NO CHILD IN

01:15:40.235 --> 01:15:43.005
AMERICA IS TALKED SUCH AS I

01:15:43.071 --> 01:15:45.240
WAS. BUT OUR REMIND US THAT

THIS UNDERSTANDING A RELIGIOUS

01:15:48.010 --> 01:15:50.012
TRADITION AND SOMETHING THAT I

01:15:50.078 --> 01:15:53.682
COULD FIND EASILY RIGHT NOW

01:15:53.749 --> 01:15:55.017
WHEN I STARTED TO LOOK IT UP. I

01:15:55.083 --> 01:15:56.485
COULD RELATE VERY SIMILAR

01:15:56.551 --> 01:15:58.287
EXPERIENCES THOUGH NOT THE

01:15:58.353 --> 01:15:59.655

01:17:37.319 --> 01:17:39.855
FACT THAT OTHERS. HERE IN OUR

DIVERSITY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE

01:17:59.641 --> 01:18:02.110
HISTORY OF THE US WILL DESCRIBE

01:18:02.177 --> 01:18:04.546
HOW MANY OF THE SAME LAWS THAT

I DESCRIBED TRADITIONS AND

01:18:08.050 --> 01:18:09.217
PRACTICES. WERE ALSO ANTI

SEMITIC FOR EXAMPLE WERE AIMED

01:18:11.453 --> 01:18:15.657
AT CHOOSE. AND IN I CAN'T

01:18:15.724 --> 01:18:17.559
IMAGINE THAT SUCH A COURSE

01:18:17.626 --> 01:18:20.529
WOULD NOT ADDRESS HOW EACH TIME

01:18:20.595 --> 01:18:22.431
WE SEE AN INCREASE IN HATE

01:18:22.497 --> 01:18:26.034
CRIMES WHETHER AGAINST BLACKS

01:18:26.101 --> 01:18:28.637

THAT. THE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT

01:21:22.844 --> 01:21:27.215
THAT PICTURE. AT IN UTAH WHERE

01:21:27.282 --> 01:21:29.851
THEY- CELEBRATE THE

01:21:29.918 --> 01:21:32.287
CONSTRUCTION AND THE COMPLETION

ASIAN AMERICAN FACE IN THAT

01:21:36.925 --> 01:21:38.526

01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:42.530
CONSTRUCTION LEASE THE WESTERN

01:21:42.597 --> 01:21:44.132
PORTION OF THE WELL ROAD WAS

01:21:44.199 --> 01:21:46.701
DONE ON PRIMARILY BY CHINESE

01:21:46.768 --> 01:21:48.937
AMERICANS WHO REALLY SUFFERED

01:21:49.004 --> 01:21:50.171
IN LABOR UNDER INCREDIBLY

01:21:50.238 --> 01:21:51.973
DIFFICULT CONDITIONS MUCH MORE

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:53.908
DIFFICULT THAN THE FOLKS

01:21:53.975 --> 01:21:55.577
BUILDING FROM THE FROM THE

01:21:55.644 --> 01:21:58.046
EAST. I YEAH WE REALLY YOU KNOW

01:21:58.113 --> 01:21:59.648
I THINK A LOT OF MY OWN

01:21:59.714 --> 01:22:01.516
COLLEAGUES PROBABLY DON'T

01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:02.784
REALIZE THAT THERE WAS

01:22:02.851 --> 01:22:05.053
EFFECTIVELY A STATE SPONSORED

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:05.654
GENOCIDE HERE IN THE STATE OF

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:07.656
CALIFORNIA. IN THE EIGHTEEN

01:22:07.722 --> 01:22:08.857
FIFTIES AGAINST NEEDED

01:22:08.923 --> 01:22:10.859
CALIFORNIANS NATIVE AMERICANS.

01:22:10.925 --> 01:22:12.093
AND THERE'S AN INCREDIBLE

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:13.595
PROFESSOR DOWN TO UCLA WHO

01:22:13.662 --> 01:22:15.697
INTERESTINGLY IS A MEMBER OF

01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:16.564
BOTH THE HISTORY DEPARTMENT

01:22:16.631 --> 01:22:18.233
AND- THE AMERICAN INDIAN

01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:20.435
STUDIES. DEPARTMENT THAT'S WHAT

01:22:20.502 --> 01:22:21.870
THEY CALL THEIR- WHO WROTE IN

01:22:21.936 --> 01:22:24.172
AMAZING BUT THAT- I GOT ON MY

01:22:24.239 --> 01:22:25.240
RADAR SCREEN BECAUSE IT JERRY

01:22:25.307 --> 01:22:26.474
BROWN GIVEN THE SPEECH ABOUT IT

01:22:26.541 --> 01:22:27.842
A HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY A

01:22:27.909 --> 01:22:29.477
COUPLE YEARS BACK THAT I. NOW

01:22:29.544 --> 01:22:31.946
HAVE IN REFERENCE- HI. YEAH

01:22:32.013 --> 01:22:33.715

ARE SO MANY STORIES AND GET

01:22:34.949 --> 01:22:36.618
UNDER TOLD AN UNDER APPRECIATED

01:22:36.685 --> 01:22:38.353
I THINK THIS MOMENT WE'RE

01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:39.154
STARTING TO ASK THOSE QUESTIONS

01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:43.291
AND- A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY YOU

01:22:43.358 --> 01:22:43.858
KNOW WHY WE TAKE IT DOWN THE

01:22:43.925 --> 01:22:47.562
STATUES IT'S- THAT. YOU KNOW.

01:22:47.629 --> 01:22:48.129
TWO YOU KNOW IT IS EASY TO

01:22:48.196 --> 01:22:48.697
THING ABOUT THE STATUE OF

01:22:48.763 --> 01:22:51.766
COURSE. THAT THEY'RE BOTH- A

01:22:51.833 --> 01:22:53.601
COMMEMORATION OF THE MOMENT

01:22:53.668 --> 01:22:54.636
THAT THEIR COMMEMORATING SO IN

01:22:54.703 --> 01:22:56.938
THE CASE OF. OF THE CHRISTOPHER

01:22:57.005 --> 01:22:58.640
COLUMBUS STATUE DOWN HERE. IT'S

01:22:58.707 --> 01:23:00.575
A IT'S A COMMEMORATION OF A

01:23:00.642 --> 01:23:02.010
FOURTEEN NINETY TWO. BUT IT'S

01:23:02.077 --> 01:23:03.044
ALSO COMMEMORATION OF THE

01:23:03.111 --> 01:23:04.646
MOMENT WHEN THAT STATUE WAS

01:23:04.713 --> 01:23:06.581
DECIDED TO BE PUT UP. RIGHT

01:23:06.648 --> 01:23:07.215
IT'S A IT'S A COMMEMORATION OF

01:23:07.282 --> 01:23:09.017
THE MOMENT OF EIGHTEEN NINETY

01:23:09.084 --> 01:23:09.851
TWO OR WHENEVER IT WAS THAT

01:23:09.918 --> 01:23:11.920
THAT WAS. THAT WAS PUT UP IN

01:23:11.986 --> 01:23:12.854
AND THE VALUES AT THAT TIME AND

01:23:12.921 --> 01:23:14.155
I THINK THAT'S- AN INTERESTING

01:23:14.222 --> 01:23:15.357
PART OF THE DISCUSSION OVER THE

01:23:15.423 --> 01:23:16.658
CONFEDERATE WAR STATUES RIGHT

01:23:16.725 --> 01:23:18.460
NOW IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT. ABOUT

01:23:18.526 --> 01:23:20.295
THE CIVIL WAR HISTORY. IT'S

01:23:20.362 --> 01:23:22.097
ALSO ABOUT THE VALUES THAT WENT

01:23:22.163 --> 01:23:23.298
BEHIND THOSE PEOPLE WHO

01:23:23.365 --> 01:23:26.000
DECIDED. TO CREATE MONUMENT

01:23:26.067 --> 01:23:28.436
AVENUE IN RICHMOND AND- AND THE

01:23:28.503 --> 01:23:30.872
KINDS OF VALUES THEY WERE

01:23:30.939 --> 01:23:31.473
TRYING TO UPHOLD AT THE TIME.

01:23:31.539 --> 01:23:32.440
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING FOR

01:23:32.507 --> 01:23:33.808
US TO SPEND SOME TIME THINKING

01:23:33.875 --> 01:23:35.210
ABOUT AND CRITICIZING AND

01:23:35.276 --> 01:23:39.247
ENGAGING IN CLEARING. SO I

01:23:39.314 --> 01:23:43.485
CERTAINLY VERY MUCH. VERY MUCH-

01:23:43.551 --> 01:23:46.087
I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE EXTENT TO

01:23:46.154 --> 01:23:47.355
WHICH WE'RE WE'RE NOW STARTED

01:23:47.422 --> 01:23:49.257
TAKE SERIOUSLY HOW IMPORTANT IT

01:23:49.324 --> 01:23:51.693
IS FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE TO GET

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:54.129
EXPOSURE TO AN TO GRAPPLE WITH

01:23:54.195 --> 01:23:58.933
THE KIND OF WORK THE KIND OF

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.402
PEDAGOGY THAT IS AT THE HEART

01:24:00.468 --> 01:24:01.870
OF THE ETHNIC STUDIES

01:24:01.936 --> 01:24:04.773
CURRICULUM. AND I WILL SAY YOU

01:24:04.839 --> 01:24:05.573
KNOW WE TALK ABOUT THE ETHNIC

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:06.775
STUDIES COURSE LET'S LET'S

01:24:06.841 --> 01:24:08.676
REMIND OURSELVES THIS ISN'T ONE

01:24:08.743 --> 01:24:10.278
COURSE RIGHT THAT THE IDEA HERE

01:24:10.345 --> 01:24:11.613
IS THAT IT'S A IT'S A

01:24:11.679 --> 01:24:13.148
GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS YOU CAN

01:24:13.214 --> 01:24:14.549
CHOOSE FROM A LONG LIST OF

01:24:14.616 --> 01:24:17.051
COURSES AND THOSE COURSES COULD

01:24:17.118 --> 01:24:17.852
INVOLVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT

01:24:17.919 --> 01:24:19.421
TOPICS IN IT'S ACTUALLY TRUE

01:24:19.487 --> 01:24:20.755
YOU CAN NOTE THAT THERE IS

01:24:20.822 --> 01:24:21.990
THERE SOME LIMITATION TO THIS

01:24:22.056 --> 01:24:23.525
BILL I MEAN THERE THERE'S- YOU

01:24:23.591 --> 01:24:25.326
KNOW YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO

01:24:25.393 --> 01:24:29.397
TAKE A CLASS ON. YOUR BODY FOR

01:24:29.464 --> 01:24:30.799
DAN BUT YOU PROP TO TAKE A

01:24:30.865 --> 01:24:32.901
CLASS ON BETTY FRIEDAN IN CHILE.

01:24:32.967 --> 01:24:34.769
YOU KNOW THAT THAT WOULD. BRING

01:24:34.836 --> 01:24:36.671
TO THE INTO. NOW OF FEMINISM

01:24:36.738 --> 01:24:40.208
AND REYES AN AFRICAN STUDIES-

01:24:40.275 --> 01:24:41.443
SO THAT THAT WOULD BE I THINK

01:24:41.509 --> 01:24:42.644
THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD START TO

01:24:42.710 --> 01:24:45.146
SEE. IN THE COURSES THAT WOULD

01:24:45.213 --> 01:24:49.417
BE DEVELOPED. I DO YOU KNOW. HE

01:24:49.484 --> 01:24:50.552
TO THE EXTENT OF THE CAL STATE

01:24:50.618 --> 01:24:52.020
IS ALREADY OBSOLETE GOING

01:24:52.086 --> 01:24:55.023
THROUGH THEIR OWN PROCESS OF

01:24:55.089 --> 01:24:57.125
TRYING TO COME UP WITH A

01:24:57.192 --> 01:24:59.260
REQUIREMENT THAT IS RESPONSIVE

01:24:59.327 --> 01:25:00.228
TO OUR WHAT THE AUTHORS LOOKING

01:25:00.295 --> 01:25:01.830
TO DO HERE- I THINK THAT WILL

01:25:01.896 --> 01:25:04.032
ALREADY YOU KNOW IMPROVE SOME

01:25:04.098 --> 01:25:05.433
OF THE COSTS THAT. THE MY GOOD

01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:07.702
FRIEND- FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY

01:25:07.769 --> 01:25:11.172
WAS WAS WAS TALKING ABOUT.

01:25:11.239 --> 01:25:11.840
THERE WERE THERE THERE

01:25:11.906 --> 01:25:12.874
CERTAINLY WOULD BE SOME COSTS

01:25:12.941 --> 01:25:14.576
ASSOCIATED BUT I ALWAYS I DON'T

01:25:14.642 --> 01:25:16.744
THINK IT'S QUITE. AS HIGH AS

01:25:16.811 --> 01:25:18.880
AND AS IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED JUST

01:25:18.947 --> 01:25:21.683
GIVEN. THE WORK THAT'S ALREADY

01:25:21.749 --> 01:25:23.017
UNDER WAY WITHIN THE CAL STATE

01:25:23.084 --> 01:25:24.486
SYSTEM AND I GUESS I DO WANT TO

01:25:24.552 --> 01:25:25.520
SPEND A LOT OF TIME TALKING

01:25:25.587 --> 01:25:27.922
ABOUT THAT I MAKE. I HEAR A LOT

01:25:27.989 --> 01:25:29.123
OF MY COLLEAGUES SAYING WE NEED

01:25:29.190 --> 01:25:31.226

THAT'S WHAT WE DO WITH BILLS

01:25:33.728 --> 01:25:34.996
RIGHT A LOT OF TIMES WE USE

01:25:35.063 --> 01:25:36.764
BILLS AS IT OPPORTUNITY AS A

01:25:36.831 --> 01:25:38.366
VEHICLE TO PUSH GOVERNMENT

01:25:38.433 --> 01:25:41.202
AGENCIES. AND I WILL SAY I DO

01:25:41.269 --> 01:25:42.403
SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF

01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:44.506
MY COLLEAGUE FROM HER INTO. IN

01:25:49.244 --> 01:25:53.114
NOT LOST ON ME. THAT THAT THAT

01:25:53.181 --> 01:25:53.915
IN SOME OF OUR SISTER AND

01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:55.016
BROTHER STATES AROUND THE

01:25:55.083 --> 01:25:58.186
COUNTRY. WE HAVE LEGISLATORS.

01:25:58.253 --> 01:26:00.722
WHO ARE GOING IN AND ASKING

01:26:00.788 --> 01:26:02.223

VERY SAME PROFESSORS WHO TEACH

01:26:11.165 --> 01:26:12.734
IN THE CLASSES THAT WE WANT TO

01:26:13.268 --> 01:26:15.169
REQUIREMENT. AND THAT'S A

01:26:15.236 --> 01:26:16.337
DANGEROUS THING I THERE'S NO

01:26:16.404 --> 01:26:18.406
QUESTION ABOUT IT I DO I DO

RESPECTFULLY PUSH BACK ON MY

01:26:20.008 --> 01:26:21.075
COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO WHEN

HE SAID THAT HE DOESN'T SEE ANY

01:26:22.243 --> 01:26:23.478
PROBLEM WITH LEGISLATOR.

01:26:23.545 --> 01:26:25.280
WEIGHING IN AND DICTATING TERMS

OF OUR LEGISLATURE HAVE THE

01:29:41.442 --> 01:29:43.111
GOVERNOR THE CAL STATE. AND THE

01:29:43.177 --> 01:29:45.079

01:29:48.282 --> 01:29:50.318
ABSOLUTELY OPTIMAL FOR THIS

01:29:50.384 --> 01:29:52.854
DECISION FOR IT IS BETTER. FOR

01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:53.488

TO A FRUITFUL MEETING FOR

01:30:24.018 --> 01:30:25.186

01:30:43.371 --> 01:30:45.206
SO FAR BUT THAT STILL HAS SO

01:30:45.273 --> 01:30:47.975

IN THE CONSTITUTION. THE SAME

IMPOSE POLICIES WITH WHICH I

01:31:55.276 --> 01:31:57.945
TOTALLY DISAGREE IS SOMETHING

01:31:58.012 --> 01:32:00.514

KING. ADD TO THE MARCH ON

01:32:18.199 --> 01:32:20.434
WASHINGTON WHICH IS SIMILAR IN

01:32:20.501 --> 01:32:21.802
MANY WAYS TO SOME OF THE

01:32:21.869 --> 01:32:23.137
MARCHES THAT WE ARE SEEING

01:32:23.204 --> 01:32:25.373

AS OUR REPUBLIC. AND SO IS

01:32:39.487 --> 01:32:41.222
SOMEONE WHO LIVED THROUGH THAT

01:32:44.058 --> 01:32:45.526
WE'RE STILL SEEING THIS KIND OF

01:32:45.593 --> 01:32:48.129
BLATANT OUTRAGEOUS RACISM IN

01:32:48.195 --> 01:32:50.798

01:32:50.865 --> 01:32:52.934
THAT MAYBE TODAY. WE CAN MAKE A

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.903

AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE PUBLIC

01:33:02.243 --> 01:33:03.544
POLICY FOR THE GREAT STATE OF

01:33:03.611 --> 01:33:06.213
CALIFORNIA WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER

01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:09.917
AND I WAS MUCH YOUNGER THEN- ON

01:33:09.984 --> 01:33:11.986
THE STREETS PROTESTING WITH

01:33:12.053 --> 01:33:14.322
EVERYBODY WHO FELT THAT THIS

AND LOOK AND AM CONCERNED AS A

01:33:23.764 --> 01:33:26.133
AS A WOMAN WHO HAS LIVED THE

01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:27.835
LIFE WHERE I'VE EXPERIENCED

INCREDIBLE GENDER BIASES MOST

01:33:30.137 --> 01:33:33.274
WOMEN HAVE EXPERIENCED. IN THIS

01:33:33.341 --> 01:33:34.508
SECTION ASSUME THAT IS STILL.

01:33:34.575 --> 01:33:36.777
DEEPLYARE ENDEMIC IN OUR

01:33:36.844 --> 01:33:41.115
SOCIETY I ASK WHAT ABOUT.

01:33:41.182 --> 01:33:43.317
GENDER BIAS WHAT ABOUT SEXISM.

01:33:43.384 --> 01:33:45.453
WHAT ABOUT AS WAS MENTIONED THE

01:33:45.519 --> 01:33:47.955
WAY THE ASIAN AMERICANS WERE

01:33:48.022 --> 01:33:49.957
TREATED AND FORCED INTO A FORM

01:33:50.024 --> 01:33:51.892
OF SLAVERY BACK IN THE EIGHTEEN

01:33:51.959 --> 01:33:53.928
FIFTIES TO DEVELOP CALIFORNIA

01:33:53.995 --> 01:33:55.363
WHAT ABOUT WHAT ABOUT WHAT

01:33:55.429 --> 01:33:56.998
ABOUT THERE ARE SO MANY

01:33:57.064 --> 01:33:59.266
INSTANCES OF DISCRIMINATION

01:33:59.333 --> 01:34:00.534
THAT HAVE EXISTED IN THIS

01:34:00.601 --> 01:34:03.437
COUNTRY SO I ASK MYSELF WHAT IS

01:34:03.504 --> 01:34:05.339
DISCRIMINATION WHY IS THERE

01:34:05.406 --> 01:34:07.341
DISCRIMINATION. WE HAVE

01:34:07.408 --> 01:34:10.311
DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE OF FEAR

01:34:10.378 --> 01:34:14.448
AND IGNORANCE. THAT IS WHAT

01:34:14.515 --> 01:34:17.551
GENERATES HATE. YOUR AND

01:34:17.618 --> 01:34:20.221
IGNORANCE AND I THINK IT IS

01:34:20.287 --> 01:34:21.922
ABOUT TIME THAT WE ADDRESS THE

01:34:21.989 --> 01:34:23.824
IGNORANCE PART OF THIS AND IF

01:34:23.891 --> 01:34:26.827
IT MEANS THAT WE PASS FOURTEEN

01:34:26.894 --> 01:34:28.062
SIXTY THAT IDENTIFIES FOUR

01:34:28.129 --> 01:34:29.764
BASIC GROUPS THAT SHOULD BE

01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:32.233
ADDRESSED. AND UNDERSTANDING

01:34:32.299 --> 01:34:34.268
THAT THAT IS REALLY THE FLOOR

01:34:34.335 --> 01:34:36.437
THAT'S THE BASICS THAT WE CAN

01:34:36.504 --> 01:34:38.973
ADD TO THIS BECAUSE THERE IS

01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:41.142
ENORMOUS CHANGE THEIR SEXUALITY.

01:34:41.208 --> 01:34:43.511
OF ALL THESE ISSUES BLACK WOMEN

01:34:43.577 --> 01:34:47.815
LUCKY NECKS. AND LETTING US.

01:34:47.882 --> 01:34:50.551
PEOPLE OF ALL DIFFERENT RACES

01:34:50.618 --> 01:34:51.952
PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT RELIGIOUS

01:34:52.019 --> 01:34:54.055
PERSPECTIVES AND AS A JEW I CAN

01:34:54.121 --> 01:34:55.423
ASSURE YOU I HAVE BEEN THE

01:34:55.489 --> 01:34:58.259
VICTIM OF ANTI SEMITISM WHICH

01:34:58.325 --> 01:34:59.894
STILL RUNS TODAY FAIRLY

01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:02.997
UNABASHEDLY. WE HATE BLACKS WE

01:35:03.064 --> 01:35:04.465
HATE JEWS WE HATE FILL IN THE

01:35:04.532 --> 01:35:07.868
BLANK. WE HAVE GOT TO ADDRESS

01:35:07.935 --> 01:35:08.702
THE FEAR AND IGNORANCE IN OUR

01:35:08.769 --> 01:35:11.472
COUNTRY. IT IS INEXCUSABLE THAT

01:35:11.539 --> 01:35:13.340
IN THE NATION IT WAS BUILT BY

01:35:13.407 --> 01:35:17.078
SLAVES AND BUILD BY WOMEN AND

01:35:17.144 --> 01:35:19.080
BUILT BY PEOPLE OF COLOR. THERE

01:35:19.146 --> 01:35:21.482
WE SHOULD STILL HAVE A COUNTRY

01:35:21.549 --> 01:35:23.884
THAT TRIES AT EVERY POSSIBLE

01:35:23.951 --> 01:35:26.754
CHANCE TO PUT THOSE PEOPLE

01:35:26.821 --> 01:35:30.391
THERE. AND SO I AM GOING TO

01:35:30.458 --> 01:35:32.560
SUPPORT THIS BILL IT IS MY HOPE

01:35:32.626 --> 01:35:34.662
THAT AS THE- CAL STATE

01:35:34.728 --> 01:35:37.731
UNIVERSITY- OUR DISCUSSION IS

01:35:37.798 --> 01:35:40.201
HOW TO BEST UNDERMINE THE FEAR

01:35:40.267 --> 01:35:41.869
AND THE HATRED AND THE

01:35:41.936 --> 01:35:43.370
IGNORANCE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT

01:35:43.437 --> 01:35:45.539
EDUCATION IS SUPPOSED TO DO. IT

01:35:45.606 --> 01:35:47.208
IS SUPPOSED TO EDUCATE AND

01:35:47.274 --> 01:35:49.210
REMOVE IGNORANCE SO THAT PEOPLE

01:35:49.276 --> 01:35:50.945
MAKE DECISIONS AND IS MY GOOD

01:35:51.011 --> 01:35:52.480
COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO

01:35:52.546 --> 01:35:54.181
MENTIONED THE PURPOSE OF

01:35:54.248 --> 01:35:57.151
EDUCATION IS TO TEACH PEOPLE TO

01:35:57.218 --> 01:35:59.253
THINK CRITICALLY. GIVE PEOPLE

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:01.989
THE AXE GIVE THEM THE

01:36:02.056 --> 01:36:04.291
OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE WITH

01:36:04.358 --> 01:36:06.994
OTHERS AND WHAT WILL WE FIND

01:36:07.061 --> 01:36:08.762
THAT WE ARE ALL HUMAN BEINGS.

01:36:08.829 --> 01:36:10.698
GUARD LIST OF OURS REGARDLESS

01:36:10.764 --> 01:36:12.766
OF OUR OF OUR RACIAL

01:36:12.833 --> 01:36:14.401
COMPOSITION REGARDLESS OF

01:36:14.468 --> 01:36:16.537
MARBLE RELIGIOUS BELIEFS WE ARE

01:36:16.604 --> 01:36:19.039
ALL HUMAN BEINGS. AND THAT IS

01:36:19.106 --> 01:36:20.908
REALLY THE PROMISE OF THIS

01:36:20.975 --> 01:36:22.476
COUNTRY IT IS A PROMISE THAT

01:36:22.543 --> 01:36:24.512
THIS BILL TRIES TO START OVER

01:36:24.578 --> 01:36:26.080
AGAIN. LET'S HAVE THOSE

01:36:26.147 --> 01:36:28.249
DISCUSSIONS LET'S TALK ABOUT

01:36:28.315 --> 01:36:31.619
THE HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE IN

01:36:31.685 --> 01:36:33.921
THIS COUNTRY HISTORY SOMETHING

01:36:33.988 --> 01:36:35.189
WE DON'T REALLY GIVE A WHOLE

01:36:35.256 --> 01:36:36.323
LOT OF CONSIDERATION TO

01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:39.226
ANYMORE. BUT I THINK HISTORY IS

01:36:39.293 --> 01:36:39.960
ONE OF THE MOST INVALUABLE

01:36:40.027 --> 01:36:41.762
THINGS WE CAN DO BECAUSE THE

01:36:41.829 --> 01:36:43.931
TIMES MAY CHANGE BUT HUMAN

01:36:43.998 --> 01:36:46.000
NATURE WILL NEVER CHANGE. AND

01:36:46.066 --> 01:36:47.968
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE PROVIDE

01:36:48.035 --> 01:36:50.671
THOSE EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES

01:36:50.738 --> 01:36:53.174
THAT THIS MEASURE WILL AGAIN

01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:55.943
REYES AND MAKE PART OF A YOUNG

01:36:56.010 --> 01:36:58.412
PERSON'S EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE

01:36:58.479 --> 01:37:00.247
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND IT IS

01:37:00.314 --> 01:37:03.050
MY HOPE AS WELL. THAT THE A CAL

01:37:03.117 --> 01:37:04.552
STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM WILL

01:37:04.618 --> 01:37:07.788
COME UP WITH THE BEST PLAN AND

01:37:07.855 --> 01:37:09.857
THAT THIS BILL WILL HAVE BEEN

01:37:09.924 --> 01:37:13.194
AN INCENTIVE BUT NOT THE END OF

01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:18.165
THIS DISCUSSION. AND SO THAT

01:37:18.232 --> 01:37:20.034
AND ON BEHALF OF ALL. THE MEN.

01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:21.302
ARE IN AND OTHERS WHO HAVE AND

01:37:21.368 --> 01:37:22.169
SHE EXT THIS KIND OF

01:37:22.236 --> 01:37:25.539
DISCRIMINATION BUT ONBEHALF OF

01:37:25.606 --> 01:37:27.741
THOSE GROUPS THAT ARE NOW

01:37:27.808 --> 01:37:29.777
FIGHTING FOR JUSTICE THAT THAT

01:37:29.843 --> 01:37:31.745
HAD THAT HAS BEEN THAT IS LONG

01:37:31.812 --> 01:37:34.848
OVERDUE. IT IS FOR ALL OF US IN

01:37:34.915 --> 01:37:36.617
THE FACT THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE

01:37:36.684 --> 01:37:38.319
TO RAISE THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF

01:37:38.385 --> 01:37:40.087
OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AND ADDRESS

01:37:40.154 --> 01:37:42.056
THOSE INHERENT OF FEELINGS OF

01:37:42.122 --> 01:37:43.724
PREJUDICE AND DISCRIMINATION

01:37:43.791 --> 01:37:46.560
AND OVERCOME THEM. THERE CAN BE

01:37:46.627 --> 01:37:49.530
I THINK NO GREATER. EFFORT AND

01:37:49.597 --> 01:37:51.665
WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY.

01:37:51.732 --> 01:37:54.468

THAT THE CAL STATE UNIVERSITY

01:38:02.276 --> 01:38:04.645

AND THE QUEEN OF THE GYPSIES OF

01:38:16.924 --> 01:38:18.392
CALIFORNIA MOVE NEXT DOOR MY

01:38:18.459 --> 01:38:20.461
GRANDPARENTS. THOSE WERE THE

01:38:20.527 --> 01:38:22.396
FONDEST MEMORIES OF MY

01:38:22.463 --> 01:38:24.331
CHILDHOOD. AND WE'RE STILL

01:38:24.398 --> 01:38:25.966
FRIENDS TO THIS DAY FIFTY TWO

01:38:26.033 --> 01:38:29.103
YEARS LATER. IT WAS A RICH

01:38:29.169 --> 01:38:31.438
EXPERIENCE FOR ME- YET WHEN I

01:38:31.505 --> 01:38:33.140
WAS YOUNGER AND BY THE TIME I

01:38:33.207 --> 01:38:34.475
WAS IN SECOND GRADE MY PARENTS

01:38:34.541 --> 01:38:36.510
HAD DIVORCED AND WE WERE

01:38:36.577 --> 01:38:37.411
SPENDING A LOT OF TIME AT MY

01:38:37.478 --> 01:38:39.480
GRANDPARENTS HOUSE AND WE WERE

01:38:39.546 --> 01:38:41.048
ALWAYS GOING OVER THE GYPSIES

01:38:41.115 --> 01:38:42.916
HOUSE. BECAUSE THERE I HAD

01:38:42.983 --> 01:38:44.485
THREE MOMS THAT PAID ATTENTION

01:38:44.551 --> 01:38:45.586
TO ME THERE WERE THREE

01:38:45.653 --> 01:38:47.588
GENERATIONS IN THE FAMILY. AND

01:38:47.655 --> 01:38:49.890

DOROTHY. AND MANY OTHERS THAT

01:38:52.793 --> 01:38:54.295
WERE AT THE HOME ALL THE TIME.

01:38:54.361 --> 01:38:56.163
AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT RACISM

01:38:56.230 --> 01:38:57.064
WAS WHEN I WAS IN FIRST AND

01:38:57.131 --> 01:38:59.600
SECOND GRADE. BUT IN MEMORY

01:38:59.667 --> 01:39:00.968
THAT I STILL HOLD ALL THESE

01:39:01.035 --> 01:39:03.337
YEARS LATER WAS BEING OUT WITH

01:39:03.404 --> 01:39:06.473

01:39:12.846 --> 01:39:14.748
FEELING HURT AND I DIDN'T

01:39:14.815 --> 01:39:16.583
UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

01:39:16.650 --> 01:39:18.619

LATER WE WEREN'T DIRTY WE WERE

01:39:30.097 --> 01:39:31.398

01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:15.202
TO FIND THE REAL HISTORY OF

01:41:15.269 --> 01:41:17.738
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE I THINK

01:41:17.805 --> 01:41:21.408
THAT- WE FIND OURSELVES NOT

01:41:21.475 --> 01:41:23.210
RESPECTING OUR STUDENTS. BY

01:41:23.277 --> 01:41:25.179
TRYING TO GIVE THEM INFORMATION

01:41:25.245 --> 01:41:27.181
NOTS WATERED DOWN AND DOESN'T

01:41:27.247 --> 01:41:29.183
REALLY THE FLAT THE TRUE

01:41:29.249 --> 01:41:31.885
HISTORY OF THIS STATE AND THIS

01:41:31.952 --> 01:41:35.022
COUNTRY AND- AND BECAUSE OF

01:41:35.088 --> 01:41:36.323
THOSE STRUGGLES I ALWAYS FIND

01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:38.091
MYSELF REACHING OUT TO THOSE

01:41:38.158 --> 01:41:40.494
EVERY NEW- SOME OF THE TRIBES

01:41:40.561 --> 01:41:42.229
ENGAGING IN CONVERSATION SO I

01:41:42.296 --> 01:41:43.664
REALLY WANTED TO UNDERSTAND AND

01:41:43.730 --> 01:41:44.832
I REALLY WANT MY STUDENTS TO

01:41:44.898 --> 01:41:47.634
HAVE. THE TRUE INFORMATION SO

01:41:47.701 --> 01:41:49.736
THEN THEY CAN REALLY UNDERSTAND

01:41:49.803 --> 01:41:51.872
WHAT HAPPENED HERE I THINK THAT

01:41:51.939 --> 01:41:53.440
IF WE GIVE THEM HISTORY AND

01:41:53.507 --> 01:41:54.541
REALLY HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE

01:41:54.608 --> 01:41:56.777
MISTAKES HE MADE CAN ONLY MAKE

01:41:56.844 --> 01:41:59.146
THEM STRONGER AND BETTER FOR IT

01:41:59.213 --> 01:42:00.781
AND HOPEFULLY THEY STILL REPEAT

01:42:00.848 --> 01:42:02.282
SOME OF THE MISTAKES TAT WE'VE

01:42:02.349 --> 01:42:03.650
MADE BECAUSE I THINK EVERY

01:42:03.717 --> 01:42:06.386
GENERATION WE GROW LITTLE BY

01:42:06.453 --> 01:42:08.856
LITTLE WE GIRL AND I HOPE THAT-

01:42:08.922 --> 01:42:12.459
WE HAVEN'T STOPPED GROWING AND

01:42:12.526 --> 01:42:13.260
THIS IS JUST ONCE AT. FORWARD

01:42:13.327 --> 01:42:14.561
AND GROOMING A NECK GEN. THAT

01:42:14.628 --> 01:42:17.064
GOING TO BE. UNDERSTANDING MORE

01:42:17.130 --> 01:42:19.032
ABOUT THAT A- LITTLE BIT MORE

01:42:19.099 --> 01:42:21.168
AWARE OF THEIR SURROUNDINGS AND

01:42:21.235 --> 01:42:23.270
REALLY I THINK THIS BOILS DOWN

01:42:23.337 --> 01:42:25.138
TO UNDERSTANDING. UNDERSTANDING

01:42:25.205 --> 01:42:27.040
OTHER PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THEIR

01:42:27.107 --> 01:42:28.842
STRUGGLES AND I THINK WE CAN

01:42:28.909 --> 01:42:30.711
ONLY BE A BETTER STATE FOR IT

01:42:30.777 --> 01:42:32.846
AND SO I CALLED PARTY. AT MY

01:42:32.913 --> 01:42:34.948

PROUD OF A VOTE LIKE THIS. THE

01:43:26.133 --> 01:43:28.068
MOMENT TO BE PROUD TO STAND UP

SPECIFICALLY. NEEDS TO BE

01:43:32.706 --> 01:43:37.311
TALKED ABOUT. THIS IS A MOMENT

01:43:37.377 --> 01:43:42.349
WHERE IT'S VERY EASY. TO LOOK

01:43:42.416 --> 01:43:44.151
AT THE HOLES AND SAY WHO'S

01:43:44.217 --> 01:43:49.823
MISSING. AND I HAVE THAT SAME.

01:43:49.890 --> 01:43:52.960
INSTINCT POP UP IN MYSELF. EVEN

01:43:53.026 --> 01:43:54.261
GOING THROUGH WHAT WE'VE GONE

01:43:54.328 --> 01:43:55.762
THROUGH IN LOS ANGELES OVER THE

01:43:55.829 --> 01:43:59.866
PAST FEW WEEKS. WHEN YOU SEE A

01:43:59.933 --> 01:44:02.869
SYNAGOGUE GET DESECRATED. OR

01:44:02.936 --> 01:44:05.739

THAT EXPERIENCE IN THIS BILL

01:44:13.013 --> 01:44:13.447
AND WHERE IS THIS IN OUR

01:44:13.513 --> 01:44:16.550
DIALOGUE. THIS IS SINGULARLY A

01:44:16.617 --> 01:44:20.520
MOMENT RIGHT NOW. THAT IS ABOUT

01:44:20.587 --> 01:44:22.656
BEING A PERSON OF COLOR A

01:44:22.723 --> 01:44:26.226
WALKING AROUND IN A BLACK BODY

01:44:26.293 --> 01:44:28.028
IN THIS COUNTRY BEING DIFFERENT

01:44:28.095 --> 01:44:28.595
THEY'RE WALKING AROUND IN A

01:44:28.662 --> 01:44:32.833
WHITE BODY. THAT EVEN THOUGH IN

01:44:32.899 --> 01:44:33.800
FIFTY YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS FIVE

01:44:33.867 --> 01:44:35.002
YEARS OLD I WENT TO THE SAME

01:44:35.068 --> 01:44:37.004
KINDERGARTEN CLASS THAT. MY

01:44:37.070 --> 01:44:39.039
COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES WENT

01:44:39.106 --> 01:44:40.474
TO WE BOTH WERE IN THE SAME

01:44:40.540 --> 01:44:42.843
SCHOOL PLAY I PLAYED MARTIN

01:44:42.909 --> 01:44:44.911
LUTHER KING AT FIVE YEARS OLD.

01:44:44.978 --> 01:44:46.313
SHE HELPED BUILD THE VOTING

01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:48.348
BOOTH IN THAT SAME- BIT OF

01:44:48.415 --> 01:44:51.084
CHILD PETER WE DID. AND YET IN

01:44:51.151 --> 01:44:51.652
MY MIND AT THE TIME I DIDN'T

01:44:51.718 --> 01:44:53.987
REALIZE WILL. YEAH I CAN BE

01:44:54.054 --> 01:44:55.756
JUST LIKE MARTIN LUTHER KING

01:44:55.822 --> 01:44:56.323
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT AT THE

01:44:56.390 --> 01:45:00.027
TIME. WHITE KID GROWING UP.

01:45:00.093 --> 01:45:03.163
NICE PART LA. NOT REALIZING

01:45:03.230 --> 01:45:07.567
THAT. THERE'S SOMETHING

01:45:07.634 --> 01:45:10.937
FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT. AND

01:45:11.004 --> 01:45:11.471
FUNDAMENTALLY HARDER ABOUT

01:45:11.538 --> 01:45:15.475
WALKING DOWN THE STREET. RIDING

01:45:15.542 --> 01:45:16.576
A BICYCLE GOING TO GET YOUR

01:45:16.643 --> 01:45:18.945
LUNCH ALL THOSE SMALL MOMENTS

01:45:19.012 --> 01:45:19.546
THAT YOU DON'T NOTICE IN YOUR

01:45:19.613 --> 01:45:23.617
LIFE. IF WE CAN'T TALK

01:45:23.684 --> 01:45:24.985
SINGULARLY ABOUT RACE IN THIS

01:45:25.052 --> 01:45:29.389
MOMENT. AND FORCE THAT. THAT

01:45:29.456 --> 01:45:30.857
GREAT ON KNOWING THAT JAMES

01:45:30.924 --> 01:45:33.427
BALDWIN TALKED ABOUT NOT IN NOT

01:45:33.493 --> 01:45:35.195
EVEN IN IGNORANCE BUT A

01:45:35.262 --> 01:45:37.931
CONSCIOUS ON KNOWING. AN ACTUAL

01:45:37.998 --> 01:45:39.900
INTENTIONAL AVOIDANCE OF THE

01:45:39.966 --> 01:45:43.136
ISSUE- MISEDUCATION NOT A LACK

01:45:43.203 --> 01:45:45.505
OF EDUCATION A MISS EDUCATION.

01:45:45.572 --> 01:45:48.341
WE PRESENT A VERSION OF HISTORY

01:45:48.408 --> 01:45:48.909
IN THIS CAPITAL WHEN PEOPLE

01:45:48.975 --> 01:45:52.512
WALK IN. IN OUR CLASSROOMS IN

01:45:52.579 --> 01:45:54.815
OUR CURRICULUM AND WE'VE WAITED

01:45:54.881 --> 01:45:56.983
IN THE CURRICULUM BEFORE. WE

01:45:57.050 --> 01:45:58.819
TELL YOUNG PEOPLE LEARN ABOUT

01:45:58.885 --> 01:46:00.554
THE ENVIRONMENT IN THERE K.

01:46:00.620 --> 01:46:02.522
TWELVE EDUCATION. WE URGE THEM

01:46:02.589 --> 01:46:05.859
TO LEARN ABOUT. GENOCIDES IN

01:46:05.926 --> 01:46:11.965
WARS. I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT

01:46:12.032 --> 01:46:14.501
THAT POSTURE AND THAT THEIR

01:46:14.568 --> 01:46:16.403
RETICENCE TO REACH TOO DEEPLY

01:46:16.470 --> 01:46:18.638
OF OUR POLITICS BUT IF WE ARE

01:46:18.705 --> 01:46:20.107
NOT EDUCATING YOUNG PEOPLE

01:46:20.173 --> 01:46:24.277
ABOUT RACE. AND FORCING THAT

01:46:24.344 --> 01:46:28.548
COLLISION. AND FORCING KIDS OUT

01:46:28.615 --> 01:46:30.317
OF THEIR SHELL WE ARE MISS

01:46:30.383 --> 01:46:32.819
EDUCATING OUR CHILDREN. IT'S

01:46:32.886 --> 01:46:35.722
NOT THAT THE- THEY NOW HAVE A

01:46:35.789 --> 01:46:38.125
SUPER CHARGED EDUCATION THEY'RE

01:46:38.191 --> 01:46:38.692
JUST THEY'RE JUST GONNA BE

01:46:38.759 --> 01:46:39.259
GRADUATE WITHOUT THAT BLIND

01:46:39.326 --> 01:46:43.029
SPOT. WE'RE DOCUMENT THREE

01:46:43.096 --> 01:46:45.565
UNITS HERE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:46:45.632 --> 01:46:50.103
A CLASS. I UNDERSTAND THE

01:46:50.170 --> 01:46:53.240
PROCEDURAL CONCERNS.

01:46:53.306 --> 01:46:54.708
INTERVENING INTO EXISTING

01:46:54.775 --> 01:46:59.646
AGENCIES WORK BUT. YOU KNOW

01:46:59.713 --> 01:47:01.348
THERE THERE IS A RISK AT THIS

01:47:01.414 --> 01:47:03.316
MOMENT THE WORD ETHNIC GOES

01:47:03.383 --> 01:47:07.621
BACK TO THE WORD ETHNOS A COMES

01:47:07.687 --> 01:47:10.090
FROM GREEK ETYMOLOGY. THE WORD

01:47:10.157 --> 01:47:13.660
THEY USED FOR OTHER. ETHNOS WAS

01:47:13.727 --> 01:47:15.829
ALSO MENTIONED IN THE FIRST

01:47:15.896 --> 01:47:16.463
GREEK TRANSLATION OF THE HEBREW

01:47:16.530 --> 01:47:20.767
BIBLE. THE TALK ABOUT NON JEWS

01:47:20.834 --> 01:47:23.036
OTHERS GOYIM. BUT THAT WORD

01:47:23.103 --> 01:47:25.539
ETHNOS. NOW PIERS TODAY AS

01:47:25.605 --> 01:47:29.342
ETHNIC WHAT IS OTHER. THERE

01:47:29.409 --> 01:47:31.111
HAVE BEEN MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE

01:47:31.178 --> 01:47:31.645
BEEN OTHERS THROUGHOUT OUR

01:47:31.711 --> 01:47:34.648
HISTORY. AND CERTAINLY NOW THE

01:47:34.714 --> 01:47:37.984
OTHER. AND THE WAY WE TREATED

01:47:38.051 --> 01:47:41.254
IS PEOPLE BY COLOR THEIR SKIN.

01:47:41.321 --> 01:47:41.788
BUT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHERS

01:47:41.855 --> 01:47:43.156
BECAUSE OF THEIR RELIGION.

01:47:43.223 --> 01:47:45.959
BECAUSE OF THEIR GENDER.

01:47:46.026 --> 01:47:46.493
BECAUSE THEIR IMMIGRATION

01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:52.165
STATUS. AND THE RISK IN THIS

01:47:52.232 --> 01:47:57.671
MOMENT IS CASTING. THAT BERRIER

01:47:57.737 --> 01:48:01.208
OF OTHERNESS WHEN WE ALL HAVE

01:48:01.274 --> 01:48:03.944
TO FIND SOME BRIDGES BETWEEN.

01:48:04.010 --> 01:48:08.114
OUR TRIBES. IF YOU GO BACK TO

01:48:08.181 --> 01:48:09.816
THE CURRENT BIBLE VERSES IN

01:48:09.883 --> 01:48:12.285
THIS WEEK EVEN THE DIVISION OF

01:48:12.352 --> 01:48:13.453
ALL THE TRIBES EVEN AMONGST

01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:15.121
JEWS THERE WERE TWELVE TRIBES

01:48:15.188 --> 01:48:16.356
AND THEY ALL WANTED TO WAR

01:48:16.423 --> 01:48:17.757
AMONGST EACH OTHER AND FIND

01:48:17.824 --> 01:48:20.026
THEIR OWN ETHNIC LINES THAT

01:48:20.093 --> 01:48:22.462
DIVIDE THEMSELVES. BUT WHEN WE

01:48:22.529 --> 01:48:24.397
ARE MURMURING AGAINST ONE

01:48:24.464 --> 01:48:25.532
ANOTHER WE BECOME A TOWER OF

01:48:25.599 --> 01:48:30.003
BABEL. WE GET NOTHING DONE.

01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:31.438
LET'S BE CLEAR IN OUR VOICE

01:48:31.504 --> 01:48:34.941
TODAY. I'LL BE CLEAR THIS

01:48:35.008 --> 01:48:36.243
MOMENT IS ABOUT A CONVERSATION.

01:48:36.309 --> 01:48:39.713
ABOUT ETHNICITY BUT AS THE BILL

01:48:39.779 --> 01:48:41.848
MENTIONS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT

01:48:41.915 --> 01:48:44.050
RACIALIZED MINORITIES AND WHAT

01:48:44.117 --> 01:48:45.518
IT IS TO GO THROUGH LIFE THAT

01:48:45.585 --> 01:48:49.456
WAY. I PROBABLY SUPPORT THIS

01:48:49.522 --> 01:48:54.027
BILL. AND I HOPE WE CAN MOVE

01:48:54.094 --> 01:48:56.129
THIS WHOLE CONVERSATION FORD IS

01:48:56.196 --> 01:48:58.298
LEGISLATURE IN A WAY THAT.

01:48:58.365 --> 01:48:59.799
REALLY RECTIFY IS OUR TROOPS IN

01:48:59.866 --> 01:49:03.503
HISTORY. BUT THROUGH THAT TRUTH

01:49:03.570 --> 01:49:05.205
SOME KIND OF RECONCILIATION.

01:49:05.272 --> 01:49:08.008
THANK YOU CENTER STERN CENTER

01:49:08.074 --> 01:49:10.543

01:49:18.585 --> 01:49:20.086
WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM. AROUND

SANTA MONICA. YOU KNOW WE DO

01:49:24.391 --> 01:49:26.393
NEED TO SET A HIGH BAR FOR

01:49:26.459 --> 01:49:27.260
IMPOSING REQUIREMENTS ON THE

01:49:27.327 --> 01:49:29.396
CSU AND IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR

01:49:29.462 --> 01:49:32.499
THE CSU TO DO IT ON THEIR OWN.

01:49:32.565 --> 01:49:35.168
BUT I FEEL LIKE THIS MOMENT.

01:49:35.235 --> 01:49:38.405
CALLS FOR THAT CHANGE. I KEEP

01:49:47.948 --> 01:49:49.516
TYPE OF RACISM AND AS THE ONLY
