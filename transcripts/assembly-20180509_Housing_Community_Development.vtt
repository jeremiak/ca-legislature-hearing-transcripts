00:39:40.245 --> 00:39:44.148 region:rollup2
MOST SOLAR PANELS USE UTILIZE

00:39:42.247 --> 00:39:45.950 region:rollup2
LITHIUM AS THEIR PRIMARY BATTERY

00:39:44.148 --> 00:39:47.685 region:rollup2
SOURCE.

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:49.454 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THE RELIEF OFFERED IN

00:39:47.685 --> 00:39:51.055 region:rollup2
THIS MEASURE. WE CAN CERTAINLY

00:39:49.454 --> 00:39:53.458 region:rollup2
EXPECT THE COST OF LIVING IN TO

00:39:51.055 --> 00:39:55.660 region:rollup2
INCREASE THEREBY INCREASING THE

00:39:53.458 --> 00:39:57.629 region:rollup2
PRICE OF SOLAR PANELS.

00:39:55.660 --> 00:40:00.298 region:rollup2
THESE COSTS DIRECTLY IN KEY

00:39:57.629 --> 00:40:02.634 region:rollup2
GREASE THE COST OF HOUSING IN

00:40:00.298 --> 00:40:03.901 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:40:02.634 --> 00:40:04.903 region:rollup2
AS WE DISCUSS AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:40:03.901 --> 00:40:06.804 region:rollup2
OPTIONS WE MUST TAKE INTO

00:40:04.903 --> 00:40:08.740 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT.

00:40:06.804 --> 00:40:09.874 region:rollup2
THAT INACTION ON THIS PROPOSAL

00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:13.011 region:rollup2
WILL ULTIMATELY LEAD TO

00:40:09.874 --> 00:40:14.512 region:rollup2
INCREASES AND HOUSING COSTS.

00:40:13.011 --> 00:40:16.314 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY BILL NINETEEN FIFTEEN

00:40:14.512 --> 00:40:18.449 region:rollup2
PROVIDES A SMALL EXEMPTION TO

00:40:16.314 --> 00:40:20.318 region:rollup2
THE PEER REVIEW OF. THE BUILDING

00:40:18.449 --> 00:40:21.619 region:rollup2
AND HOMES AND JOBS AT.

00:40:20.318 --> 00:40:23.087 region:rollup2
BY EXPLICITLY EXCLUDING MINING

00:40:21.619 --> 00:40:24.789 region:rollup2
CLAIMS

00:40:23.087 --> 00:40:26.457 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE CAN PRESERVE

00:40:24.789 --> 00:40:27.959 region:rollup2
THIS PROSPEROUS INDUSTRY WHILE

00:40:26.457 --> 00:40:30.228 region:rollup2
ALSO ENSURE EARNING THE

00:40:27.959 --> 00:40:31.896 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT. OF GREEN ENERGY

00:40:30.228 --> 00:40:33.264 region:rollup2
MATERIALS FOR OUR GREEN TACK

00:40:31.896 --> 00:40:34.766 region:rollup2
KHANOM.

00:40:33.264 --> 00:40:36.668 region:rollup2
WE CANNOT HAMPER THE DEVELOPMENT

00:40:34.766 --> 00:40:38.236 region:rollup2
OF THIS KEY TECHNOLOGY AS WE

00:40:36.668 --> 00:40:40.238 region:rollup2
MOVE TOWARDS OUR CLIMATE GOALS

00:40:38.236 --> 00:40:42.507 region:rollup2
AS SUCH I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST

BE ENTERED INTO THE RECORD.

00:40:55.954 --> 00:40:59.624 region:rollup2
AMIN.

00:40:59.123 --> 00:41:01.092 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MR MATHIS YOUR

00:40:59.624 --> 00:41:02.894 region:rollup2
WITNESS.

00:41:01.092 --> 00:41:03.995 region:rollup2
GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS COUNTY

00:41:02.894 --> 00:41:05.630 region:rollup2
FOOT AND I'M ELECTED IN YOUR

00:41:03.995 --> 00:41:07.131 region:rollup2
COUNTY CLERK RECORDER I'M HERE

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:09.100 region:rollup2
TODAY TO TESTIFY IN STRONG

00:41:07.131 --> 00:41:10.468 region:rollup2
SUPPORT OF AB NINETEEN FIFTEEN.

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:12.503 region:rollup2
WHEN THIS PRIME WHEN SB TWO WAS

00:41:10.468 --> 00:41:14.038 region:rollup2
PASSED LAST YEAR IT WAS

00:41:12.503 --> 00:41:15.139 region:rollup2
INITIALLY UNCLEAR WHETHER OR NOT

00:41:14.038 --> 00:41:16.741 region:rollup2
IT WOULD EVEN APPLY TO MINING

00:41:15.139 --> 00:41:18.142 region:rollup2
CLAIM DOCUMENTS WE HAD MANY MANY

00:41:16.741 --> 00:41:20.611 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS AMONGST COUNTY

00:41:18.142 --> 00:41:21.746 region:rollup2
RECORDERS. AND THAT'S BECAUSE

00:41:20.611 --> 00:41:22.880 region:rollup2
THE MINING CLAIM DOCUMENTS ARE

00:41:21.746 --> 00:41:25.183 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THAN ALL OF THE OTHER

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:25.717 region:rollup2
DOCUMENTS LISTED ON IN THE

00:41:25.183 --> 00:41:26.784 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT CODE UNDER THIS

00:41:25.717 --> 00:41:28.219 region:rollup2
SECTION.

00:41:26.784 --> 00:41:29.821 region:rollup2
THEY ARE RECORDED AGAINST PUBLIC

00:41:28.219 --> 00:41:30.855 region:rollup2
LANDS ONCE THE MINERALS ARE

00:41:29.821 --> 00:41:32.924 region:rollup2
EXTRACTED THAT'S PERSONAL

00:41:30.855 --> 00:41:34.158 region:rollup2
PROPERTY IN THE LAND ALWAYS

00:41:32.924 --> 00:41:35.927 region:rollup2
REMAINS IN STATE AND FEDERAL

00:41:34.158 --> 00:41:37.695 region:rollup2
OWNERSHIP WHICH IS EXPLICITLY

00:41:35.927 --> 00:41:38.363 region:rollup2
EXEMPT FROM S. B. TO.

00:41:37.695 --> 00:41:40.832 region:rollup2
SO INSTEAD.

00:41:38.363 --> 00:41:42.100 region:rollup2
MINING CLAIM DOCUMENTS SEES ME

00:41:40.832 --> 00:41:43.468 region:rollup2
NOT INSTEAD BUT THEY'RE ALSO

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:45.269 region:rollup2
UNIQUE IN ANOTHER WAY.

00:41:43.468 --> 00:41:46.170 region:rollup2
AND AS MR MATHIS SAID EARLIER

00:41:45.269 --> 00:41:47.505 region:rollup2
THEY ARE THE ONLY TYPE OF

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:48.973 region:rollup2
DOCUMENT THAT I'M AWARE OF THAT

00:41:47.505 --> 00:41:50.575 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE RECORDED EVERY

00:41:48.973 --> 00:41:52.243 region:rollup2
SINGLE YEAR IN ORDER FOR THE

00:41:50.575 --> 00:41:54.746 region:rollup2
MINOR TO KEEP THEIR CLAIM.

00:41:52.243 --> 00:41:56.414 region:rollup2
SO IT MINOR. WHO HAS?

00:41:54.746 --> 00:41:58.149 region:rollup2
AS FOR INSTANCE FIVE CLAIMS

00:41:56.414 --> 00:41:59.617 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GONNA PAY AROUND THREE

00:41:58.149 --> 00:42:01.686 region:rollup2
HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS

00:41:59.617 --> 00:42:03.121 region:rollup2
EVERY SINGLE YEAR OR UP TO FOUR

00:42:01.686 --> 00:42:03.688 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS IN A TEN YEAR

00:42:03.121 --> 00:42:05.456 region:rollup2
PERIOD IF YOU CONTRAST THAT

00:42:03.688 --> 00:42:06.491 region:rollup2
WITH.

00:42:05.456 --> 00:42:08.359 region:rollup2
THE TYPICAL HOMEOWNER WHO

00:42:06.491 --> 00:42:10.194 region:rollup2
REFINANCES THEIR PROPERTY MAYBE

00:42:08.359 --> 00:42:11.262 region:rollup2
TWICE IN THAT DECADE. THEY'RE

00:42:10.194 --> 00:42:13.765 region:rollup2
ONLY GOING TO PAY FOUR HUNDRED

00:42:11.262 --> 00:42:15.066 region:rollup2
AND FIFTY DOLLARS SO ROUGHLY

00:42:13.765 --> 00:42:16.467 region:rollup2
AROUND TEN PERCENT OR A LITTLE

00:42:15.066 --> 00:42:18.035 region:rollup2
MORE THAN TEN PERCENT OF WHAT

00:42:16.467 --> 00:42:19.337 region:rollup2
THAT MINOR WILL PAY INTO THE

00:42:18.035 --> 00:42:20.671 region:rollup2
HOUSING FIND.

00:42:19.337 --> 00:42:22.140 region:rollup2
SO WHAT WE'RE ASKING WITH

00:42:20.671 --> 00:42:23.674 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FIFTEEN IS

00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:24.942 region:rollup2
JUST AND EQUITABLE COLLECTION

00:42:23.674 --> 00:42:26.577 region:rollup2
ACROSS ALL INDUSTRIES AND ALL

00:42:24.942 --> 00:42:27.645 region:rollup2
PROPERTY OWNERS.

00:42:26.577 --> 00:42:29.313 region:rollup2
AND MAKE THAT CLARIFICATION

00:42:27.645 --> 00:42:31.449 region:rollup2
CLEAR IN THE LAW.

00:42:29.313 --> 00:42:33.017 region:rollup2
SO IN ADDITION A MINING CLAIMS

00:42:31.449 --> 00:42:34.786 region:rollup2
WHEN ADDED TOGETHER.

00:42:33.017 --> 00:42:35.987 region:rollup2
NOT ON THEIR OWN BUT Q.

00:42:34.786 --> 00:42:38.222 region:rollup2
MASSIVELY OF MAKE UP A LARGE

00:42:35.987 --> 00:42:39.791 region:rollup2
PORTION OF OUR LOCAL TAX BASE.

00:42:38.222 --> 00:42:42.427 region:rollup2
SO AS THESE CLAIMS GO OUT OF

00:42:39.791 --> 00:42:44.195 region:rollup2
EXISTENCE ARE LOCAL TAX BASE IN

00:42:42.427 --> 00:42:46.230 region:rollup2
INYO COUNTY IS GOING TO CONTINUE

00:42:44.195 --> 00:42:47.799 region:rollup2
TO BE REDUCED AND THEN WERE NOT

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:50.802 region:rollup2
ABLE TO RESPOND TO HELP OUR

00:42:47.799 --> 00:42:52.370 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. AS ART

00:42:50.802 --> 00:42:54.705 region:rollup2
ON REVENUES OVERALL GO DOWN.

00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:55.640 region:rollup2
MOST MINES AND I WAS READING IN

00:42:54.705 --> 00:42:57.108 region:rollup2
THE ANALYSIS IT SAYS THAT THE

00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:58.443 region:rollup2
FEE WILL HAVE LITTLE IMPACT ON

00:42:57.108 --> 00:43:00.278 region:rollup2
THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF THE

00:42:58.443 --> 00:43:01.345 region:rollup2
MINING INDUSTRY.

00:43:00.278 --> 00:43:03.147 region:rollup2
BUT JUST LIKE ANY OTHER

00:43:01.345 --> 00:43:04.115 region:rollup2
REGRESSIVE TAX.

00:43:03.147 --> 00:43:05.616 region:rollup2
THIS IS ONLY TRUE FOR THE

00:43:04.115 --> 00:43:07.318 region:rollup2
HANDFUL OF VERY PROFITABLE MINES

00:43:05.616 --> 00:43:08.719 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE.

00:43:07.318 --> 00:43:10.288 region:rollup2
IT'S A SMALL MINERS LIKE SEVENTY

00:43:08.719 --> 00:43:11.522 region:rollup2
SEVEN YEAR OLD KATE CONDI WHO

00:43:10.288 --> 00:43:13.291 region:rollup2
JUST LOST SEVEN CLAIMS LAST YEAR

00:43:11.522 --> 00:43:15.159 region:rollup2
IN INYO COUNTY. OR LIKE MY

00:43:13.291 --> 00:43:16.761 region:rollup2
FATHER WHO PASSED AWAY FIVE

00:43:15.159 --> 00:43:18.329 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO YET THREE CLAIMS UP

00:43:16.761 --> 00:43:19.997 region:rollup2
UNTIL THE DAY THAT HE DIED.

00:43:18.329 --> 00:43:21.799 region:rollup2
THESE ARE SMALL MINERS THAT MAKE

00:43:19.997 --> 00:43:23.167 region:rollup2
UP CUMULATIVELY A LARGE PORTION

00:43:21.799 --> 00:43:24.635 region:rollup2
OF OUR TAX BASE THAT'S WHAT

00:43:23.167 --> 00:43:26.838 region:rollup2
WE'RE ASKING FOR TODAY IS JUST A

00:43:24.635 --> 00:43:28.940 region:rollup2
CLARIFICATION. I WOULD JUST SAY

00:43:26.838 --> 00:43:30.641 region:rollup2
ONE LAST POINT. ARM OF THE EIGHT

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:31.209 region:rollup2
POINT FOUR MILLION DOCUMENTS

00:43:30.641 --> 00:43:32.143 region:rollup2
RECORDED IN CALIFORNIA LAST

00:43:31.209 --> 00:43:34.178 region:rollup2
YEAR.

00:43:32.143 --> 00:43:37.081 region:rollup2
ONLY SIX THOUSAND OR LESS THAN

00:43:34.178 --> 00:43:38.783 region:rollup2
ZERO POINT ZERO ONE PERCENT.

00:43:37.081 --> 00:43:40.551 region:rollup2
WERE RELATED TO MINE SORT

00:43:38.783 --> 00:43:43.321 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT A VERY VERY SMALL

00:43:40.551 --> 00:43:44.655 region:rollup2
PORTION OF. THE OVERALL REVENUES

00:43:43.321 --> 00:43:46.023 region:rollup2
I WAS JUST SPEAKING OF STATE

THAT LEGISLATION.

00:45:06.304 --> 00:45:10.074 region:rollup2
IT TOOK YEARS AND YEARS TO GET

00:45:08.573 --> 00:45:12.076 region:rollup2
THAT THE LEGISLATURE MULTIPLE

00:45:30.094 --> 00:45:33.864 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE HOUSING TAKES

00:45:31.429 --> 00:45:35.166 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE YEARS TO PRODUCE TAKES.

00:45:33.864 --> 00:45:37.134 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE.

00:45:35.166 --> 00:45:38.269 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT SOURCES OF FUNDING TO

00:45:37.134 --> 00:45:40.671 region:rollup2
PRODUCE AND.

00:45:38.269 --> 00:45:42.406 region:rollup2
THE VALUE OF HAVING THIS

00:45:40.671 --> 00:45:43.541 region:rollup2
HOUSING FUND AVAILABLE TO MAKE

00:45:42.406 --> 00:45:45.142 region:rollup2
SURE TO BE THERE EVERY YEAR FOR

00:45:43.541 --> 00:45:46.944 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS IS

00:45:45.142 --> 00:45:48.145 region:rollup2
VITAL.

00:45:46.944 --> 00:45:49.880 region:rollup2
EXEMPTION SUCH AS THESE.

00:45:48.145 --> 00:45:51.382 region:rollup2
REDUCE THE IMPACT OF THE BILL

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:53.050 region:rollup2
AND UNDERMINE THEPURPOSE WHICH

00:45:51.382 --> 00:45:54.986 region:rollup2
AGAIN IS TO CREATE RELIABLE AND

00:45:53.050 --> 00:45:55.586 region:rollup2
PERMITS OR STE OF AFFORDABLE

00:45:54.986 --> 00:45:57.154 region:rollup2
HOUSING.

00:45:55.586 --> 00:45:58.889 region:rollup2
WE ALSO ARE CONCERNED THAT

00:45:57.154 --> 00:46:00.258 region:rollup2
ALLOWING EXEMPTION SUCH AS THESE

00:45:58.889 --> 00:46:02.260 region:rollup2
WILL CREATE A SLIPPERY SLOPE.

00:46:00.258 --> 00:46:04.061 region:rollup2
THAT WILL BRING EVERY INTEREST

00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:05.329 region:rollup2
GROUP OUT OF THE WOODWORK TO.

00:46:04.061 --> 00:46:07.698 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY.

00:46:05.329 --> 00:46:09.200 region:rollup2
SEEKING THE SAME TYPE OF

00:46:07.698 --> 00:46:11.035 region:rollup2
EXEMPTION AND ULTIMATELY

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:11.602 region:rollup2
DECIMATE THE HOUSING TRUST FUND

00:46:11.035 --> 00:46:13.237 region:rollup2
SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE MUST

00:46:11.602 --> 00:46:14.238 region:rollup2
OPPOSE.

00:46:13.237 --> 00:46:15.006 region:rollup2

START TO CREATE EXEMPTIONS IT

00:46:48.939 --> 00:46:52.309 region:rollup2
WILL CREATE A SLIPPERY SLOPE AND

00:46:50.641 --> 00:46:53.978 region:rollup2
UNDERMINE THE VALUE OF THE FUND

00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:54.979 region:rollup2

IN YOUR PART OF THE STATE.

00:47:31.115 --> 00:47:33.718 region:rollup2

I WILL SAY A FEW THINGS ABOUT

IT.

00:47:48.432 --> 00:47:51.535 region:rollup2
.

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:53.604 region:rollup2
AS YOU HEARD AND YOU KNOW LAST

00:47:57.208 --> 00:48:00.878 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION. THAT WE FINALLY

00:47:58.809 --> 00:48:02.346 region:rollup2

ACHIEVE TWO THIRDS VOTE.

00:48:02.346 --> 00:48:06.550 region:rollup2
CREATING A PERMANENT SOURCE OF

FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:09.453 region:rollup2
IN THE MOST INTENSE HOUSING

00:48:07.752 --> 00:48:10.888 region:rollup2
CRISIS OUR STATE HAS HAD. ON AND

00:48:09.453 --> 00:48:12.256 region:rollup2
THERE ARE NUMBER OF BILLS THAT

00:48:10.888 --> 00:48:14.625 region:rollup2
HAVE SUGGESTED POTENTIAL

00:48:12.256 --> 00:48:17.361 region:rollup2
EXCEPTIONS OR CARVE OUTS FOR SP

00:48:14.625 --> 00:48:19.063 region:rollup2

OF OF COLLECTING THESE REVENUES

AND AT THIS TIME GIVEN THE

00:48:20.798 --> 00:48:23.968 region:rollup2
CRISIS GIVEN WHERE WE ARE I

00:48:22.533 --> 00:48:25.102 region:rollup2
CAN'T SUPPORT CARVE OUTS.

00:48:23.968 --> 00:48:27.271 region:rollup2
.

00:48:25.102 --> 00:48:28.939 region:rollup2
I ALSO WANT TO JUST MENTION WITH

00:48:27.271 --> 00:48:31.409 region:rollup2
REGARDS TO THIS INDUSTRY I HEARD

00:48:28.939 --> 00:48:32.710 region:rollup2
YOU USE PHRASES ABOUT HOW SB TWO

00:48:31.409 --> 00:48:34.044 region:rollup2
COULD BE THE RUIN OF THIS

00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:35.146 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY BUT YOU ALSO REFLECT

00:48:34.044 --> 00:48:36.680 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT THIS IS A VERY

00:48:35.146 --> 00:48:38.682 region:rollup2
PROSPEROUS INDUSTRY.

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:40.184 region:rollup2
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE A SEVENTY

00:48:38.682 --> 00:48:42.019 region:rollup2
FIVE DOLLARS FEE IN THE CONTEXT

00:48:40.184 --> 00:48:43.954 region:rollup2
OF A THREE POINT SEVEN SIX

00:48:42.019 --> 00:48:46.323 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY.

00:48:43.954 --> 00:48:48.959 region:rollup2
SEEMS DE MINIMUS AND AS YOUR

00:48:46.323 --> 00:48:50.027 region:rollup2
WITNESS HAD POINTED OUT A MINING

00:48:48.959 --> 00:48:51.395 region:rollup2
CLAIMS THE REAL ESTATE

00:48:50.027 --> 00:48:52.930 region:rollup2
TRANSACTIONS ONLY REPRESENT I

00:48:51.395 --> 00:48:55.166 region:rollup2
THINK YOU SAID ZERO POINT ZERO

00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:57.101 region:rollup2
ONE PERCENT. OF THE DOCUMENTS

00:48:55.166 --> 00:48:59.537 region:rollup2
THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT SO. I

00:48:57.101 --> 00:49:00.738 region:rollup2
DON'T NECESSARILY SEE THE THE

00:48:59.537 --> 00:49:02.740 region:rollup2
THE FINANCIAL IMPACT ON YOUR

00:49:00.738 --> 00:49:03.707 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY THAT I I KNOW YOU'RE

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:04.775 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ABOUT.

00:49:03.707 --> 00:49:06.043 region:rollup2
ALL THIS BEING SAID AS I

00:49:04.775 --> 00:49:07.711 region:rollup2
SUGGESTED TO YOU I THINK THERE'S

00:49:06.043 --> 00:49:09.313 region:rollup2
A DIFFERENT WAY IF THE MINE

00:49:07.711 --> 00:49:10.881 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY IS IN FACT IN JEOPARDY.

00:49:09.313 --> 00:49:12.783 region:rollup2
OF OF OF TRYING TO MOVE FOR

00:49:10.881 --> 00:49:14.084 region:rollup2
OTHER POLICIES TO HELP IT. I

00:49:12.783 --> 00:49:16.587 region:rollup2
JUST THINK THAT IN THE CONTEXT

00:49:14.084 --> 00:49:17.922 region:rollup2
OF SP TO THE IDEA CARVE OUT AT

00:49:16.587 --> 00:49:19.857 region:rollup2
THIS TIME IS NOT ONE THAT.

00:49:17.922 --> 00:49:21.358 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT THAT I CAN SUPPORT I'M

00:49:19.857 --> 00:49:23.327 region:rollup2
AND I DO WANT TO SAY TO A

00:49:21.358 --> 00:49:24.728 region:rollup2
WITNESS WE HAD INTENDED WITH THE

00:49:23.327 --> 00:49:25.229 region:rollup2
THE THE WRITING OF THIS BILL TO

00:49:24.728 --> 00:49:26.297 region:rollup2
INCLUDE THE REAL ESTATE

00:49:25.229 --> 00:49:28.599 region:rollup2
DOCUMENTS THAT WERE IN ITS

00:49:26.297 --> 00:49:30.134 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY. THAT DID CAPTURE

00:49:28.599 --> 00:49:31.402 region:rollup2
ON THE DOCUMENTS WERE TALKING

00:49:30.134 --> 00:49:33.003 region:rollup2
ABOUT AND THAT WAS PART OF THE

00:49:31.402 --> 00:49:33.671 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE INTENT

00:49:33.003 --> 00:49:35.806 region:rollup2
SO.

00:49:33.671 --> 00:49:37.374 region:rollup2
SO THAT IS MY PERSPECTIVE ON

00:49:35.806 --> 00:49:39.710 region:rollup2
THIS I I'M HAPPY TO HAVE ONGOING

00:49:37.374 --> 00:49:41.679 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS. ON ONE

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:43.347 region:rollup2
LAST THOUGHT I HAD IS IF OUR

00:49:41.679 --> 00:49:46.150 region:rollup2
MINING INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA IS

00:49:43.347 --> 00:49:47.251 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME ONLY AND

00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:48.953 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA MINERALS.

00:49:47.251 --> 00:49:49.854 region:rollup2
.

00:49:48.953 --> 00:49:51.889 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE'S LESS OF A

00:49:49.854 --> 00:49:53.524 region:rollup2
CONCERN ABOUT US LOSING MINING

00:49:51.889 --> 00:49:54.692 region:rollup2
BUSINESS. WITH.

00:49:53.524 --> 00:49:55.960 region:rollup2
MINERALS THAT ARE ONLY

00:49:54.692 --> 00:49:58.095 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE IN OUR STATE TO OTHER

00:49:55.960 --> 00:50:00.097 region:rollup2
STATES SO SO THAT ALSO SOMETHING

00:49:58.095 --> 00:50:01.665 region:rollup2
THAT I'VE WAIT A AS I. CONSIDER

00:50:00.097 --> 00:50:02.900 region:rollup2
MY PERSPECTIVE ON THAT SO.

00:50:01.665 --> 00:50:04.134 region:rollup2
IT'S UNFORTUNATE WILL BE ABLE

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:04.735 region:rollup2

OTHER CONVERSATION.

00:50:08.639 --> 00:50:13.277 region:rollup2

WAS ONLY FIFTY FEET AWAY FROM

01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:25.342 region:rollup2
HER ELECTRICAL PANEL SO IT WOULD

01:02:22.973 --> 01:02:26.876 region:rollup2
BE AN EASY TO INSTALL A CHARTER.

01:02:25.342 --> 01:02:28.378 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WHEN I APPROACHED HER

01:02:26.876 --> 01:02:29.713 region:rollup2
LANDLORD AND EXPLAINED WHAT WE

01:02:28.378 --> 01:02:32.148 region:rollup2

FIVE TIMES OVER SEVERAL MONTHS.

01:02:33.717 --> 01:02:36.553 region:rollup2
EACH TIME EXPLAINING THAT WE

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:43.793 region:rollup2
THEE WAS A CARVE OUT FOR RENT

01:02:42.125 --> 01:02:45.295 region:rollup2
CONTROL APARTMENT MEANING THOSE

01:02:43.793 --> 01:02:46.796 region:rollup2
RENTERS DID NOT HAVE THE RIGHT

01:02:45.295 --> 01:02:48.431 region:rollup2
TO USE THEIR OWN ELECTRICITY. TO

01:02:46.796 --> 01:02:49.566 region:rollup2
POWER THEIR CARS.

01:02:48.431 --> 01:02:50.767 region:rollup2
BARBOUR LIVES IN A RENT

01:02:49.566 --> 01:02:52.836 region:rollup2
CONTROLLED APARTMENT SO HER

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:54.371 region:rollup2
LANDLORD COULD LEGALLY DENY HER

01:02:52.836 --> 01:02:56.806 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT TO USE HER OWN CLEAN

01:02:54.371 --> 01:02:58.141 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY TO POWER HER CAR.

01:02:56.806 --> 01:03:00.176 region:rollup2
THERE ARE NO PUBLIC CHARGERS IN

01:02:58.141 --> 01:03:01.344 region:rollup2
HER NEIGHBORHOOD SO SHE COULD

01:03:00.176 --> 01:03:03.213 region:rollup2
NOT GET THAT HE'D BE SHE

01:03:01.344 --> 01:03:04.748 region:rollup2

01:03:03.213 --> 01:03:06.583 region:rollup2
CAR TODAY.

01:03:04.748 --> 01:03:08.685 region:rollup2
WHEN I SAW THAT THERE WAS A

01:03:06.583 --> 01:03:10.086 region:rollup2
SINGLE FIFTEEN WORD LINE IN AB

01:03:08.685 --> 01:03:11.721 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE SIXTY FIVE

01:03:10.086 --> 01:03:12.789 region:rollup2
DISALLOWING RENT CONTROL TENANTS

01:03:11.721 --> 01:03:14.291 region:rollup2
FROM HAVING THE RIGHT TO USED

01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:16.593 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN CLEAN ENERGY TO POWER

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:18.395 region:rollup2
THEIR CARS. I CONTACTED ASSEMBLY

01:03:16.593 --> 01:03:19.663 region:rollup2
MEMBER AMERITECH SOCHI AND ASKED

01:03:18.395 --> 01:03:21.431 region:rollup2
IF HE WOULD WRITE A NEW LAW THAT

01:03:19.663 --> 01:03:23.366 region:rollup2
CORRECTED THIS PROBLEM AND

01:03:21.431 --> 01:03:24.734 region:rollup2
THAT'S HOW AB SEVENTEEN NINETY

01:03:23.366 --> 01:03:26.169 region:rollup2
SIX CAME TO BE.

01:03:24.734 --> 01:03:28.171 region:rollup2
FROM MY RESEARCH I'VE LEARNED

01:03:26.169 --> 01:03:28.638 region:rollup2
THAT THERE OVER HALF A MILLION

01:03:28.171 --> 01:03:29.839 region:rollup2
RENT CONTROL UNITS IN

01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:31.341 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:03:29.839 --> 01:03:33.309 region:rollup2
NONE OF THOSE PEOPLE CAN SWITCH

01:03:31.341 --> 01:03:35.045 region:rollup2
FROM BURNING GASOLINE UNLESS

01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:36.846 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE ACCESS TO A CHARTER

01:03:35.045 --> 01:03:38.815 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY WORK WHICH THE VAST

01:03:36.846 --> 01:03:40.116 region:rollup2
MAJORITY DO NOT.

01:03:38.815 --> 01:03:41.718 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS OF THESE PEOPLE WOULD

01:03:40.116 --> 01:03:43.653 region:rollup2
PROBABLY SWITCH IMMEDIATELY IF

01:03:41.718 --> 01:03:45.789 region:rollup2
THEY COULD INSTALL A CHARGER AT

01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:47.624 region:rollup2
HOME THIS IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE

01:03:45.789 --> 01:03:50.427 region:rollup2
OF LOW HANGING FRUIT.

01:03:47.624 --> 01:03:51.561 region:rollup2

01:03:50.427 --> 01:03:53.530 region:rollup2

01:03:53.530 --> 01:03:57.334 region:rollup2

WITH AFFORDABLE ELECTRIC CARS

01:03:59.202 --> 01:04:02.839 region:rollup2
AND LOW COST RENEWABLE ENERGY

01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:04.841 region:rollup2
MOST PEOPLE CAN NOW SWITCH TO A

01:04:02.839 --> 01:04:06.576 region:rollup2
CLEAN LOW IMPACT LAUGHED

01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:08.378 region:rollup2
LIFESTYLE. BUT THEY NEED TO BE

01:04:06.576 --> 01:04:10.513 region:rollup2
ABLE TO ACCESS THAT CLEAN ENERGY

01:04:08.378 --> 01:04:12.115 region:rollup2
WITH THEIR CARS AB SEVENTEEN

01:04:10.513 --> 01:04:14.250 region:rollup2
NINETY SIX WILL DO THAT FOR OVER

RECORDED IN THE LAST SIXTY

01:51:46.733 --> 01:51:50.204 region:rollup2

SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE THERE'S

BEEN A BUILDING DEFICIT.

01:51:58.345 --> 01:52:01.248 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY WE HAVE ACCUMULATED A

01:51:59.446 --> 01:52:03.383 region:rollup2

MARKETABILITY OF HOME

01:52:08.155 --> 01:52:11.658 region:rollup2

MATERIALS AND EVEN LABOR.

01:52:23.937 --> 01:52:27.207 region:rollup2
THESE ACTORS ARE EXASPERATED IN

01:52:25.672 --> 01:52:29.176 region:rollup2
AREAS IMPACTED BY NATURAL

FIRES OF STRUCK ON MY DISTRICT.

01:52:30.677 --> 01:52:33.981 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

01:52:31.778 --> 01:52:35.148 region:rollup2
ISSUE STATEWIDE.

01:52:33.981 --> 01:52:37.084 region:rollup2
CURRENT LAWS ALLOW THESE

01:52:35.148 --> 01:52:38.285 region:rollup2

EIGHTY DAYS.

01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:42.422 region:rollup2
WHILE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE

01:52:40.921 --> 01:52:44.558 region:rollup2
THE AUTHORITY TO EXTEND THESE

01:52:42.422 --> 01:52:45.926 region:rollup2
PERMITS IS OFTEN DONE ON A CASE

01:52:44.558 --> 01:52:47.160 region:rollup2
BY CASE BASIS CREATING

01:52:45.926 --> 01:52:48.362 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTY TO THE LOCAL.

01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:49.930 region:rollup2
TO THE LOCAL ADMINISTRATIVE

01:52:48.362 --> 01:52:51.431 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

01:52:49.930 --> 01:52:52.532 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY SOME JURISDICTIONS

01:52:51.431 --> 01:52:53.900 region:rollup2
HAVE TAKEN SPECIFIC ACTION TO

01:52:52.532 --> 01:52:55.736 region:rollup2
PROVE PROHIBIT THE EXTENSION OF

PROCESS AND PAY ADDITIONAL FEES.

01:53:00.207 --> 01:53:03.276 region:rollup2
AB TWENTY NINE THIRTEEN WOULD

A PERMIT BEING ISSUED.

01:53:09.616 --> 01:53:11.918 region:rollup2
HAVING TO PERMIT REMAIN VALID

01:53:10.884 --> 01:53:13.353 region:rollup2

01:53:11.918 --> 01:53:14.855 region:rollup2

REMAIN VALID FOR THREE YEARS.

01:53:16.657 --> 01:53:18.925 region:rollup2
THE LONGSTANDING REASON FOR THIS

01:53:18.458 --> 01:53:20.661 region:rollup2
IS TO PROMOTE HOUSING

01:53:18.925 --> 01:53:22.129 region:rollup2

HOUSING CREATOR. WE BELIEVE THIS

01:54:20.987 --> 01:54:23.557 region:rollup2
IS IMPORTANT.

01:54:21.755 --> 01:54:24.624 region:rollup2
I THINK WE'RE ALL WELL AWARE

01:54:23.557 --> 01:54:26.026 region:rollup2

GREAT DETAIL ABOUT JUST HOW.

01:54:26.026 --> 01:54:28.695 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT IT IS AND IT TO BRING

01:54:40.574 --> 01:54:43.210 region:rollup2
THAT TIME ALL THAT EXPENSE ALL

01:54:42.042 --> 01:54:45.078 region:rollup2
THAT EFFORTS.

01:54:43.210 --> 01:54:48.148 region:rollup2
THAT YOUR PERMIT ONCE IT'S IN

01:54:45.078 --> 01:54:50.517 region:rollup2
HAND WOULD NOT ONLY BE A VALID

01:54:48.148 --> 01:54:51.785 region:rollup2
FOR SIX MONTHS THAT JUST KIND OF

01:54:50.517 --> 01:54:53.253 region:rollup2

HOUSING COMMITTEE DEVELOPMENT

01:55:03.997 --> 01:55:07.601 region:rollup2
HAS LONG SAID THAT THE REASON

01:55:05.532 --> 01:55:09.736 region:rollup2
FOR THAT IS TO TRY TO PROMOTE

01:55:07.601 --> 01:55:09.936 region:rollup2
HOUSING AFFORDABILITY. WE THINK

01:55:09.736 --> 01:55:12.806 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:55:09.936 --> 01:55:12.973 region:rollup2
SAME CONCERN SHOULD BE AFFORDED

01:55:12.806 --> 01:55:15.442 region:rollup2
TO.

01:55:12.973 --> 01:55:17.477 region:rollup2
RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION THAT I

01:55:15.442 --> 01:55:19.346 region:rollup2
IS BUILT IN THE SITE THAT IS FAR

01:55:17.477 --> 01:55:22.082 region:rollup2
MORE DIFFICULT FAR MORE COMPLEX

01:55:19.346 --> 01:55:23.483 region:rollup2
AND. OFTEN A HAS FOR MORE ISSUES

01:55:22.082 --> 01:55:25.719 region:rollup2
DURING THE ACTUAL TIME.

01:55:23.483 --> 01:55:26.820 region:rollup2
GETTING TO THAT POINT. ARMS WE

01:55:25.719 --> 01:55:28.355 region:rollup2
BELIEVE IT MAKES ALL THE SENSE

01:55:26.820 --> 01:55:30.056 region:rollup2
THE WORLD TO EXTEND THIS TO ADD

01:55:28.355 --> 01:55:31.224 region:rollup2
TO THAT SITE BILL CONSTRUCTION.

01:55:30.056 --> 01:55:33.794 region:rollup2
ALSO.

01:55:31.224 --> 01:55:35.262 region:rollup2
AS. MANY SIM AND JUST SAID YOU

01:55:33.794 --> 01:55:37.030 region:rollup2
KNOW IT WOULD CREATE A LOT MORE

01:55:35.262 --> 01:55:39.599 region:rollup2
CERTAINTY FOR US BECAUSE IT

01:55:37.030 --> 01:55:41.435 region:rollup2
WOULD A LINE THREE YEAR PERMIT

01:55:39.599 --> 01:55:44.104 region:rollup2
VALIDITY. TO BOB THE BUILDING

01:55:41.435 --> 01:55:46.006 region:rollup2
CODE PROCESS SO WE WOULD NOT

01:55:44.104 --> 01:55:47.240 region:rollup2
HAVE UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES

01:55:46.006 --> 01:55:48.642 region:rollup2
COME UP THAT CAN ULTIMATELY

01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:51.511 region:rollup2
DRIVE UP THE COST SAID A PROJECT

01:55:48.642 --> 01:55:52.646 region:rollup2
BACK DOWN THE ROAD. SO AGAIN ARE

01:55:51.511 --> 01:55:53.980 region:rollup2

01:55:52.646 --> 01:55:55.749 region:rollup2
SIMPLE A MODEST BILL HAVING HAVE

01:55:53.980 --> 01:55:59.519 region:rollup2

YESTERDAY.

01:56:59.112 --> 01:57:01.748 region:rollup2
IT WAS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT

01:57:00.514 --> 01:57:03.617 region:rollup2
THE MEASURE WAS GONNA BE A

01:57:01.748 --> 01:57:05.619 region:rollup2
NARROW TO DO MORE THE DISASTER.

01:57:03.617 --> 01:57:06.286 region:rollup2
AND IT YOU KNOW IT IT WE

01:57:05.619 --> 01:57:08.255 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE COMMITTEES

01:57:06.286 --> 01:57:09.422 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS BUT I THINK THERE ARE

01:57:08.255 --> 01:57:11.391 region:rollup2
TWO THINGS REALLY.

01:57:09.422 --> 01:57:14.060 region:rollup2
AT ISSUE HERE ONE IS THE.

01:57:11.391 --> 01:57:14.694 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T CHANGE YOU KNOW THE

01:57:14.060 --> 01:57:15.462 region:rollup2
BUILDING CODES DURING A CERTAIN

01:57:14.694 --> 01:57:16.229 region:rollup2
MY TIME IN THE

01:57:15.462 --> 01:57:17.964 region:rollup2
PROVIDE SOME UNCERTAIN HELPERS.

01:57:16.229 --> 01:57:19.466 region:rollup2
WE CERTAINLY SYMPATHIZE WITH

01:57:17.964 --> 01:57:21.301 region:rollup2
THAT ISSUE THE ISSUE THAT WE

01:57:19.466 --> 01:57:22.736 region:rollup2
HAVE ARE MOST CONCERNED WITH IS

01:57:21.301 --> 01:57:24.437 region:rollup2
THAT THREE YEAR DELAY ONCE THE

01:57:22.736 --> 01:57:26.239 region:rollup2
PERMIT IS PULLED. AND IT SEEMS

01:57:24.437 --> 01:57:27.941 region:rollup2
THAT THAT IS CONTRARY TO THE OF

01:57:26.239 --> 01:57:28.775 region:rollup2
THE FIFTEEN BILL PACKAGE THAT WE

01:57:27.941 --> 01:57:30.977 region:rollup2
CALL YOU NOTING DEBATED LAST

01:57:28.775 --> 01:57:32.045 region:rollup2
YEAR. AND AB SEVENTY THREE THE

01:57:30.977 --> 01:57:33.580 region:rollup2
THE CHAIRMAN'S BILL THAT

01:57:32.045 --> 01:57:34.948 region:rollup2
STREAMLINED THE PROCESS SO

01:57:33.580 --> 01:57:36.249 region:rollup2
BUILDER COULD ACTUALLY USE YOUR

01:57:34.948 --> 01:57:37.484 region:rollup2
MEASURE TO STREAMLINE THE

01:57:36.249 --> 01:57:39.019 region:rollup2
PROCESS PULLED BUILDING FROM IT

01:57:37.484 --> 01:57:40.320 region:rollup2
AND I'M BILL FOR THREE YEARS.

01:57:39.019 --> 01:57:42.956 region:rollup2
AND IF WE ARE HOUSING CRISIS

01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:43.556 region:rollup2
WHICH I THINK WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE

01:57:42.956 --> 01:57:45.692 region:rollup2
WE THINK WE NEED TO BUILD AS

01:57:43.556 --> 01:57:46.259 region:rollup2
MUCH AS WE CAN AS FAST AS WE CAN

01:57:45.692 --> 01:57:47.861 region:rollup2
AND WE THINK THAT PROVISION

01:57:46.259 --> 01:57:50.030 region:rollup2
ALONE. WILL DELAY IT FOR THREE

01:57:47.861 --> 01:57:51.431 region:rollup2
OR SOME LITTLE UNSURE HOW

01:57:50.030 --> 01:57:52.465 region:rollup2
DELAYING FOR THREE YEARS IS

01:57:51.431 --> 01:57:54.067 region:rollup2
GOING TO LEAD TO MORE HOUSING

01:57:52.465 --> 01:57:56.403 region:rollup2
AND WHAT HAVE YOU THE MEMBERS

01:57:54.067 --> 01:57:56.770 region:rollup2

AND WE ALSO.

01:58:05.145 --> 01:58:08.415 region:rollup2
DO WOULD SUPPORT ALL OF THE

01:58:07.113 --> 01:58:10.083 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS THAT WERE IN THE

01:58:08.415 --> 01:58:10.750 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AS WELL BUT

01:58:10.083 --> 01:58:13.386 region:rollup2
WE ALSO THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO

01:58:10.750 --> 01:58:15.855 region:rollup2
BE. JUST FOR THAT DISASTER AREAS

01:58:13.386 --> 01:58:17.257 region:rollup2
WHICH WE WOULD SUPPORT SO WE DO

01:58:15.855 --> 01:58:21.428 region:rollup2
ALSO APOLOGIZE FOR MIKE IN THEIR

01:58:17.257 --> 01:58:22.295 region:rollup2

GOOD MORNING TRACY RYAN ROW KIND

01:58:22.295 --> 01:58:26.466 region:rollup2
OF ABSENCE OF CALIFORNIA ALSO

01:58:23.964 --> 01:58:26.1000 region:rollup2
POSE LESS AMENDED FOR THE

01:58:26.466 --> 01:58:28.368 region:rollup2
REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED

01:58:26.1000 --> 01:58:29.836 region:rollup2
THINKING.

01:58:28.368 --> 01:58:31.705 region:rollup2
GREAT LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE

01:58:29.836 --> 01:58:32.906 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE UP LET ME MAKE A FEW

01:58:31.705 --> 01:58:34.841 region:rollup2
COMMENTS ON THIS BECAUSE I THINK

01:58:32.906 --> 01:58:35.742 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A BIT OF CONFUSION

01:58:34.841 --> 01:58:37.577 region:rollup2
AROUND THIS BILL.

01:58:35.742 --> 01:58:40.080 region:rollup2
A LOT OF FOLKS HAD UNDERSTOOD

01:58:37.577 --> 01:58:42.015 region:rollup2
THIS TO BE FOCUSED ON ON.

01:58:40.080 --> 01:58:43.516 region:rollup2
DISASTER AREAS AND THAT ACTION

01:58:42.015 --> 01:58:44.751 region:rollup2
IS NOT WHAT THE BILL WAS DRAFTED

01:58:43.516 --> 01:58:44.951 region:rollup2
TO DO BUT I DO KNOW THERE WAS

01:58:44.751 --> 01:58:47.320 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:58:44.951 --> 01:58:48.054 region:rollup2
THAT WAS THERE WAS A PERCEPTION

01:58:47.320 --> 01:58:49.723 region:rollup2
AND THAT.

01:58:48.054 --> 01:58:50.590 region:rollup2
THE AMENDMENT THAT WE HAD

01:58:49.723 --> 01:58:52.359 region:rollup2
SUGGESTED IN THE COMMITTEE

01:58:50.590 --> 01:58:54.794 region:rollup2
ANNOUNCES THAT WE DO THAT IS ONE

01:58:52.359 --> 01:58:58.231 region:rollup2
THAT. I STILL. THINK.

01:58:54.794 --> 01:58:58.231 region:rollup2
WOULD MAKE SENSE THAT BEING SAID

01:58:58.298 --> 01:59:01.668 region:rollup2
WILLING TO ACCEPT THAT.

01:58:59.766 --> 01:59:02.669 region:rollup2
WITH A ON THE PREMISE THAT

01:59:01.668 --> 01:59:04.537 region:rollup2
WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF AN INTENSE

01:59:02.669 --> 01:59:06.439 region:rollup2
HOUSING CRISIS AND THAT WHILE WE

01:59:04.537 --> 01:59:06.906 region:rollup2
HAVE DISASTER AREAS THAT HAVE A

01:59:06.439 --> 01:59:08.641 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR EXACERBATED

01:59:06.906 --> 01:59:10.610 region:rollup2
SITUATION.

01:59:08.641 --> 01:59:11.911 region:rollup2
THAT CRISIS IS ALSO EXACERBATED

01:59:10.610 --> 01:59:13.713 region:rollup2
OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE AND SO

01:59:11.911 --> 01:59:15.415 region:rollup2
AT THIS TIME THAT AMENDMENT IS

01:59:13.713 --> 01:59:16.349 region:rollup2
NOT GOING TO BE TAKEN BUT I DO

01:59:15.415 --> 01:59:17.617 region:rollup2
THINK IT IS A WORTHY

01:59:16.349 --> 01:59:20.720 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION THAT WE SHOULD.

01:59:17.617 --> 01:59:21.221 region:rollup2
CONTINUE ON I DO APPRECIATE THE

01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:23.556 region:rollup2
AUTHOR'S.

01:59:21.221 --> 01:59:24.691 region:rollup2
ACCEPTANCE OF OTHER AMENDMENTS

01:59:23.556 --> 01:59:26.159 region:rollup2
ARE TO ALLOW THE PERMIT TO

01:59:24.691 --> 01:59:27.594 region:rollup2
REMAIN VALID FOR THREE YEARS

01:59:26.159 --> 01:59:28.695 region:rollup2
FROM THE DATE THAT IT'S ISSUED

01:59:27.594 --> 01:59:30.296 region:rollup2
BUT NOT TO ALLOW FOR AN

01:59:28.695 --> 01:59:32.298 region:rollup2
EXTENSION OF AN ADDITIONAL THREE

01:59:30.296 --> 01:59:33.366 region:rollup2
YEARS. IF WORK IS ABANDONED OR

01:59:32.298 --> 01:59:35.301 region:rollup2
SUSPENDED.

01:59:33.366 --> 01:59:36.603 region:rollup2
AS WAS NOTED IN THE ANNOUNCES

01:59:35.301 --> 01:59:37.537 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING

01:59:36.603 --> 01:59:38.304 region:rollup2
OFFICIALS WHO HAD OPPOSED THE

01:59:37.537 --> 01:59:40.106 region:rollup2
BILL.

01:59:38.304 --> 01:59:41.174 region:rollup2
HAD CONCERNS ABOUT WORK STONE'S

01:59:40.106 --> 01:59:42.709 region:rollup2
AND CONSTRUCTION SITES BEEN

01:59:41.174 --> 01:59:43.677 region:rollup2
ABANDONED FOR EXTENDED PERIODS

01:59:42.709 --> 01:59:46.312 region:rollup2
OF TIME.

01:59:43.677 --> 01:59:46.479 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL MAKESHIFT SHELTERS

01:59:46.312 --> 01:59:48.415 region:rollup2
FOR.

01:59:46.479 --> 01:59:50.383 region:rollup2
THAT MIGHT CREATE HEALTH AND

01:59:48.415 --> 01:59:52.185 region:rollup2
SAFETY HAZARDS THAT IS CONCERNED

01:59:50.383 --> 01:59:53.119 region:rollup2
I'VE SHARED AS WELL AND THE

01:59:52.185 --> 01:59:53.853 region:rollup2
AUTHOR AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT

01:59:53.119 --> 01:59:55.488 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:59:53.853 --> 01:59:56.856 region:rollup2
AND I'D LOVE A LITTLE BIT OF

01:59:55.488 --> 01:59:57.690 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION ON THAT I DO THINK

01:59:56.856 --> 01:59:59.526 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:59:57.690 --> 02:00:01.327 region:rollup2
THE AMENDMENTS NARROW OF THE

01:59:59.526 --> 02:00:02.595 region:rollup2
LENGTH OF TIME AS IT WAS

02:00:01.327 --> 02:00:04.764 region:rollup2
ORIGINALLY PROPOSED BUT.

02:00:02.595 --> 02:00:06.232 region:rollup2
THERE IS A DISTANCE BETWEEN SIX

02:00:04.764 --> 02:00:08.034 region:rollup2
MONTHS AND THREE YEARS.

02:00:06.232 --> 02:00:09.636 region:rollup2
WE'D INITIALLY SUGGESTED A YEAR

02:00:08.034 --> 02:00:11.171 region:rollup2
AND A HALF WHICH AGAIN I STILL

02:00:09.636 --> 02:00:12.906 region:rollup2
THINK MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE.

02:00:11.171 --> 02:00:14.908 region:rollup2
THIS IS AN ONGOING CONVERSATION

02:00:12.906 --> 02:00:16.009 region:rollup2
BUT I WANTED TO MENTION WHERE

02:00:14.908 --> 02:00:17.043 region:rollup2
THE MOMENTS OF LANDED.

02:00:16.009 --> 02:00:19.145 region:rollup2
AND I DO.

02:00:17.043 --> 02:00:21.514 region:rollup2
ALSO APPRECIATE A A SUNSET DATE

02:00:19.145 --> 02:00:23.750 region:rollup2
ON THIS UP FOR FIVE YEARS.

02:00:21.514 --> 02:00:25.485 region:rollup2
WE IT'S WE HAD SUPPORTED THREE.

02:00:23.750 --> 02:00:26.786 region:rollup2
THE AUTHOR WOULD PREFER FOR

02:00:25.485 --> 02:00:28.755 region:rollup2
THIS TO BE A DEFINITE.

02:00:26.786 --> 02:00:30.990 region:rollup2
WE CAME TO FIVE.

02:00:28.755 --> 02:00:32.258 region:rollup2
THAT DOES NOT GIVE A LITTLE BIT

02:00:30.990 --> 02:00:33.993 region:rollup2
MORE TIME FOR US TO UNDERSTAND

02:00:32.258 --> 02:00:35.462 region:rollup2
WHAT THIS IS GOING TO GO SO THIS

02:00:33.993 --> 02:00:36.663 region:rollup2
BILL HAS BEEN A BIT OF A WORK IN

02:00:35.462 --> 02:00:38.198 region:rollup2
PROGRESS.

02:00:36.663 --> 02:00:39.799 region:rollup2
WITH A NUMBER STAKEHOLDERS AND

02:00:38.198 --> 02:00:41.101 region:rollup2
I DO HOPE AND I KNOW THAT THE

02:00:39.799 --> 02:00:42.235 region:rollup2
AUTHOR WILL CONTINUE THE

02:00:41.101 --> 02:00:43.670 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION CERTAINLY NOW.

02:00:42.235 --> 02:00:45.305 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S MORE CLARITY ON

02:00:43.670 --> 02:00:47.107 region:rollup2
EXACTLY WHAT THE BILL IS BUT.

02:00:45.305 --> 02:00:48.208 region:rollup2
WANNA JUST TURN BACK TO THE

02:00:47.107 --> 02:00:50.844 region:rollup2
AUTHOR IF YOU HAVE COMMENTS

02:00:48.208 --> 02:00:51.444 region:rollup2
YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE BASED ON SOME

02:00:50.844 --> 02:00:51.878 region:rollup2
OF THE FEEDBACK YOU'VE HEARD.

02:00:51.444 --> 02:00:53.980 region:rollup2
WELL FIRST OF ALL.

02:00:51.878 --> 02:00:55.048 region:rollup2
IT IS IT WHEN WE LOOK YOU LOOK

02:00:53.980 --> 02:00:56.783 region:rollup2
AT OUR FACT SHEET ABOUT THIS

02:00:55.048 --> 02:00:58.284 region:rollup2
BILL WE DO REFERENCE OF FIRES

02:00:56.783 --> 02:00:59.419 region:rollup2
BUT WE ALSO REFERENCES TO THIS

02:00:58.284 --> 02:01:00.420 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THIS IS A STATEWIDE

02:00:59.419 --> 02:01:02.388 region:rollup2
ISSUE. SO WAS.

02:01:00.420 --> 02:01:04.090 region:rollup2
MY DOOR'S BEEN OPEN ON THIS AND.

02:01:02.388 --> 02:01:04.290 region:rollup2
IF THERE WAS CONFUSION ABOUT

02:01:04.090 --> 02:01:06.860 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:01:04.290 --> 02:01:07.460 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS

02:01:06.860 --> 02:01:09.162 region:rollup2
WELCOME TO COME AND TALK TO US

02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:10.296 region:rollup2
BUT WE NEVER. EVER SAID THAT WE

02:01:09.162 --> 02:01:12.632 region:rollup2
WERE GONNA LIMIT THIS JUST TO

02:01:10.296 --> 02:01:13.166 region:rollup2
THE FIRE AREAS SO SO I WAS QUITE

02:01:12.632 --> 02:01:15.802 region:rollup2
FRANKLY SURPRISED BY THE

02:01:13.166 --> 02:01:16.736 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION A BASED UPON THAT. UP

02:01:15.802 --> 02:01:18.404 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY NOT IN THE INTEREST

02:01:16.736 --> 02:01:20.340 region:rollup2
OF A BUILDER TO DELAY THERE ARE

02:01:18.404 --> 02:01:23.209 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT HAPPEN HOWEVER THAT

02:01:20.340 --> 02:01:23.710 region:rollup2
THAT CAUSED DELAYS. AND A WHAT

02:01:23.209 --> 02:01:24.144 region:rollup2
BUILDERS REALLY WANT HIS

02:01:23.710 --> 02:01:25.445 region:rollup2
CERTAINTY

02:01:24.144 --> 02:01:27.580 region:rollup2
AND WHEN THAT WHEN A PERMIT

02:01:25.445 --> 02:01:28.748 region:rollup2
EXPIRES AFTER SIX MONTHS AND

02:01:27.580 --> 02:01:29.916 region:rollup2
THEN BUILDING CODES CHANGE AND

02:01:28.748 --> 02:01:31.851 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAVE TO RE APPLY

02:01:29.916 --> 02:01:33.153 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL FEES. THAT ISN'T

02:01:31.851 --> 02:01:35.021 region:rollup2
HELPING OUR HOUSING CRISIS

02:01:33.153 --> 02:01:37.090 region:rollup2
POINT AND SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING

02:01:35.021 --> 02:01:38.258 region:rollup2
TO DO IS IS TO CREATE A SYSTEM

02:01:37.090 --> 02:01:39.359 region:rollup2
WHERE WE ACTUALLY HAVE SOME

02:01:38.258 --> 02:01:40.860 region:rollup2
CERTAINTY FOR BUILDERS. A

02:01:39.359 --> 02:01:42.228 region:rollup2
UNIFORM STANDARD FOR BUILDERS

02:01:40.860 --> 02:01:43.429 region:rollup2
AND TO GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY

02:01:42.228 --> 02:01:44.430 region:rollup2
TO DO WHAT THEY DO BEST NOT TO

02:01:43.429 --> 02:01:45.999 region:rollup2
BUILD HOUSES.

02:01:44.430 --> 02:01:47.100 region:rollup2
IS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE

02:01:45.999 --> 02:01:48.535 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE

02:01:47.100 --> 02:01:50.470 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES AT TIMES IN ACTUALLY

02:01:48.535 --> 02:01:52.005 region:rollup2
GETTING THAT DONE NOBODY WANTS

02:01:50.470 --> 02:01:53.173 region:rollup2
THAT NOBODY WANTS TO. IF YOU'RE

02:01:52.005 --> 02:01:54.541 region:rollup2
A BILL TO EAT THE LAST THING YOU

02:01:53.173 --> 02:01:56.442 region:rollup2
WANT IS TO LEAVE YOUR PROJECT

02:01:54.541 --> 02:01:58.344 region:rollup2
ABANDONED. YOU WANT TO GET THAT

02:01:56.442 --> 02:01:59.312 region:rollup2
DONE AS QUICKLY AND AS YOU CAN

02:01:58.344 --> 02:02:00.947 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO

02:01:59.312 --> 02:02:01.915 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW. PAPER PAY FOR YOUR OWN

02:02:00.947 --> 02:02:04.284 region:rollup2
BILLS AND MOVE ON WITH YOUR OWN

02:02:01.915 --> 02:02:05.385 region:rollup2
FAMILY SO SO I I WILL CONTINUE

02:02:04.284 --> 02:02:06.419 region:rollup2
TO WORK WITH PEOPLE ON THIS BILL

02:02:05.385 --> 02:02:08.454 region:rollup2
I ALWAYS DO AND.

02:02:06.419 --> 02:02:10.723 region:rollup2
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO IT

02:02:08.454 --> 02:02:12.759 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY THAT ANSWERS SOME

02:02:10.723 --> 02:02:13.326 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS DO YOU

02:02:12.759 --> 02:02:15.895 region:rollup2
HAVE ANY. THAT I WAS GOING.

02:02:13.326 --> 02:02:18.031 region:rollup2
ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION.

02:02:15.895 --> 02:02:20.066 region:rollup2
OKAY WANT ONE FINAL COMMENT ALL

02:02:18.031 --> 02:02:21.601 region:rollup2
MAKE OUT. I A I THINK ONE OF THE

02:02:20.066 --> 02:02:23.203 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT IS SORT OF UNDERLINE

02:02:21.601 --> 02:02:24.270 region:rollup2
THIS I DO THINK SIX MONTHS IS A

02:02:23.203 --> 02:02:26.105 region:rollup2
BIT TOO SHORT.

02:02:24.270 --> 02:02:27.373 region:rollup2
IS THREE YEARS THE RIGHT TIME

02:02:26.105 --> 02:02:29.542 region:rollup2
FRAME I THINK THAT'S UP FOR

02:02:27.373 --> 02:02:30.043 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION ARE I DO ON THE ONE

02:02:29.542 --> 02:02:31.744 region:rollup2
HAND.

02:02:30.043 --> 02:02:33.046 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT BUILDERS DO NOT

02:02:31.744 --> 02:02:34.581 region:rollup2
HAVE.

02:02:33.046 --> 02:02:36.115 region:rollup2
A BIG INCENTIVE TO DELAY

02:02:34.581 --> 02:02:37.650 region:rollup2
PROJECTS YOU WANNA GET PROJECTS

02:02:36.115 --> 02:02:39.652 region:rollup2
DONE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. OF

02:02:37.650 --> 02:02:40.920 region:rollup2
BUT I ALSO WANNA MAKE SURE THAT

02:02:39.652 --> 02:02:42.856 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT BEING USED AS A WAY

02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:44.090 region:rollup2
TO AVOID BUILDING STANDARD

02:02:42.856 --> 02:02:45.191 region:rollup2
UPDATES THAT ARE IMPORTANT

02:02:44.090 --> 02:02:47.660 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT. AND.

02:02:45.191 --> 02:02:49.529 region:rollup2
AND WHILE IF THERE'S A WILDFIRE

02:02:47.660 --> 02:02:50.096 region:rollup2
OR ANOTHER DISASTER TO BUILDERS

02:02:49.529 --> 02:02:51.397 region:rollup2
NOT ABLE TO BILL BECAUSE OF

02:02:50.096 --> 02:02:52.332 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:02:51.397 --> 02:02:54.434 region:rollup2
THAT IS I THINK WE WOULD ALL

02:02:52.332 --> 02:02:56.269 region:rollup2
AGREE VERY LEGITIMATE REASON FOR

02:02:54.434 --> 02:02:57.904 region:rollup2
ALLOWING A PERMIT TO CONTINUE.

02:02:56.269 --> 02:02:59.539 region:rollup2
IF ON THE OTHER HAND THERE'S A

02:02:57.904 --> 02:03:01.174 region:rollup2
DELAY BECAUSE LABOR COSTS HAVE

02:02:59.539 --> 02:03:02.775 region:rollup2
RISEN OR MATERIAL COSTS HAVE

02:03:01.174 --> 02:03:03.877 region:rollup2
RISEN AND THAT IS WHY.

02:03:02.775 --> 02:03:05.044 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE

02:03:03.877 --> 02:03:07.180 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION.

02:03:05.044 --> 02:03:09.382 region:rollup2
FOR A COUPLE YEARS THAT IS A

02:03:07.180 --> 02:03:10.783 region:rollup2
LITTLE LESS PERSUASIVE TO ME SO

02:03:09.382 --> 02:03:12.485 region:rollup2
I I DO THINK VERY MUCH THAT THIS

02:03:10.783 --> 02:03:14.721 region:rollup2
IS A CONVERSATION THAT IS IN

02:03:12.485 --> 02:03:15.955 region:rollup2
FLUX AND AND NEEDS TO HAPPEN.

02:03:14.721 --> 02:03:16.990 region:rollup2
THAT WE OTHER COMMITTEES I THINK

02:03:15.955 --> 02:03:18.791 region:rollup2
IT'S A WORTHY CONVERSATION

02:03:16.990 --> 02:03:19.959 region:rollup2
BEFORE AND NOW SOMEONE TO. MOVE

02:03:18.791 --> 02:03:20.727 region:rollup2
THIS OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE WITH

02:03:19.959 --> 02:03:22.896 region:rollup2
THE AMENDMENTS WE'VE JUST

02:03:20.727 --> 02:03:23.463 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED BUT DON'T LOOK FOR THE

02:03:22.896 --> 02:03:24.063 region:rollup2
FOR THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

02:03:23.463 --> 02:03:28.668 region:rollup2
THIS.

02:03:24.063 --> 02:03:29.836 region:rollup2

THE BILL WOULD NOT PROVIDE THAT

02:06:52.171 --> 02:06:55.775 region:rollup2
DOLLARS A MONTH SO THAT LEAVES

02:06:54.340 --> 02:06:57.076 region:rollup2
IT AFFORDABILITY GAP OF A

02:06:55.775 --> 02:06:58.744 region:rollup2
THOUSAND TO TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS

02:06:57.076 --> 02:06:59.312 region:rollup2
PER MONTH. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE

02:06:58.744 --> 02:07:00.780 region:rollup2
SEEING.

02:06:59.312 --> 02:07:02.248 region:rollup2
MODERATE AND MIDDLE INCOME

02:07:00.780 --> 02:07:04.317 region:rollup2
FAMILIES LEAVE THE CITY.

02:07:02.248 --> 02:07:04.517 region:rollup2
AND TEACHERS ALSO LEAVING THE

02:07:04.317 --> 02:07:07.019 region:rollup2
CITY.

02:07:04.517 --> 02:07:08.120 region:rollup2
SO ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WHERE

02:07:07.019 --> 02:07:09.021 region:rollup2
I'M STRUGGLING TO MEET THE

02:07:08.120 --> 02:07:10.089 region:rollup2
HOUSING NEEDS.

02:07:09.021 --> 02:07:12.291 region:rollup2
OF.

02:07:10.089 --> 02:07:13.092 region:rollup2
OF MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES IS

02:07:12.291 --> 02:07:15.528 region:rollup2
ALSO THAT THE COST OF

02:07:13.092 --> 02:07:17.096 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION IS INCREDIBLY HIGH

02:07:15.528 --> 02:07:19.065 region:rollup2
AND BECAUSE THERE ARE VERY FEW

02:07:17.096 --> 02:07:20.066 region:rollup2
STATE AND FEDERAL SUBSIDIES. UMP

02:07:19.065 --> 02:07:22.668 region:rollup2
FOR BUILDING.

02:07:20.066 --> 02:07:23.136 region:rollup2
HIGH HOUSING FOR ADDED THESE

02:07:22.668 --> 02:07:25.071 region:rollup2
FAMILIES.

02:07:23.136 --> 02:07:26.772 region:rollup2
ARE SAN FRANCISCO'S ACTUALLY

02:07:25.071 --> 02:07:28.241 region:rollup2
SUBSIDIZING MODERATE INCOME

02:07:26.772 --> 02:07:30.343 region:rollup2
UNITS AT ROUGHLY A HUNDRED

02:07:28.241 --> 02:07:32.111 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER BY MORE PER

02:07:30.343 --> 02:07:33.813 region:rollup2
UNIT FOR MODERATE INCOME UNITS.

02:07:32.111 --> 02:07:35.548 region:rollup2
COMPARED TO A VERY LOW A LOW

02:07:33.813 --> 02:07:37.216 region:rollup2
INCOME UNIT. AND THE CITY IS

02:07:35.548 --> 02:07:37.683 region:rollup2
INVESTING FUNDS INTO BUILDING

02:07:37.216 --> 02:07:39.318 region:rollup2
MORE.

02:07:37.683 --> 02:07:41.087 region:rollup2
UNITS FOR MIDDLE INCOME

02:07:39.318 --> 02:07:42.788 region:rollup2
FAMILIES AND THREE TWENTY

02:07:41.087 --> 02:07:44.123 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN HOUSING BONDS SAN

02:07:42.788 --> 02:07:45.525 region:rollup2
FRANCISCO'S INVESTING EMAIL HAS

02:07:44.123 --> 02:07:47.260 region:rollup2
BEEN INVESTING EIGHTY MILLION

02:07:45.525 --> 02:07:48.261 region:rollup2
DOLLARS FOR A MODERATE INCOME

02:07:47.260 --> 02:07:49.896 region:rollup2
PRODUCTION.

02:07:48.261 --> 02:07:51.697 region:rollup2
BUT THESE FUNDS GENERATE ABOUT

02:07:49.896 --> 02:07:55.935 region:rollup2
ONLY TWO HUNDRED UNITS TOTAL

02:07:51.697 --> 02:07:56.736 region:rollup2
WHERE IS I'M OUR NEED FOR

02:07:55.935 --> 02:07:58.037 region:rollup2
MODERATE INCOME UNITS IS.

02:07:56.736 --> 02:07:59.438 region:rollup2
ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND UNITS.

02:07:58.037 --> 02:08:00.873 region:rollup2
SOBRE IN DIRE NEED OF ME I DIRE

02:07:59.438 --> 02:08:02.975 region:rollup2
NEED OF MORE RESOURCES TO

02:08:00.873 --> 02:08:05.077 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. AND AN

02:08:02.975 --> 02:08:06.546 region:rollup2
INNOVATIVE SOLUTION IS TO EXPAND

02:08:05.077 --> 02:08:08.281 region:rollup2
THE WELFARE TAX EXEMPTION TO

02:08:06.546 --> 02:08:09.649 region:rollup2
UNITS SERVING UP TO HUNDRED

02:08:08.281 --> 02:08:11.384 region:rollup2
TWENTY PERCENT OF AND MY. AND

02:08:09.649 --> 02:08:12.418 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD BE AN EFFECTIVE TOOL

02:08:11.384 --> 02:08:14.687 region:rollup2
TO INCENTIVIZE.

02:08:12.418 --> 02:08:15.888 region:rollup2
GREATER PRODUCTION BY REDUCING

02:08:14.687 --> 02:08:17.690 region:rollup2
THE OPERATING COSTS OF THESE

02:08:15.888 --> 02:08:19.659 region:rollup2
UNITS I'M WHICH WOULD IN TURN

02:08:17.690 --> 02:08:20.927 region:rollup2
ALLOW HOUSING DEVELOPERS TO BE

02:08:19.659 --> 02:08:22.395 region:rollup2
ABLE TO LEVERAGE MORE DEBT TO

02:08:20.927 --> 02:08:25.264 region:rollup2
PRODUCE THESE UNITS AND THEREBY

02:08:22.395 --> 02:08:26.332 region:rollup2
ALSO. REDUCING THE SUBSIDY OF.

02:08:25.264 --> 02:08:27.266 region:rollup2

FOR.

02:08:27.266 --> 02:08:31.170 region:rollup2
FOR PRODUCTION AND THAT WOULD

02:08:29.135 --> 02:08:33.506 region:rollup2
ALLOW OUR RESOURCES TO STRETCH A

02:08:31.170 --> 02:08:34.373 region:rollup2
STRETCH FURTHER ON TO BUILD MORE

02:08:33.506 --> 02:08:36.075 region:rollup2

ONE OF THE.

02:10:18.778 --> 02:10:23.482 region:rollup2
THE CONDITIONS USED TO TEN

PERCENT OR MORE.

02:10:23.482 --> 02:10:26.752 region:rollup2
BELOW MARKET RATE THE HOW.

02:10:26.252 --> 02:10:29.755 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU DETERMINE THAT

02:10:26.752 --> 02:10:32.358 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

02:10:29.755 --> 02:10:34.193 region:rollup2
THE IN DEPTH TONY SO ANTI OF

TONY AVERAGE JOE YOU TALKING

02:10:34.193 --> 02:10:39.398 region:rollup2
ABOUT DIE BECAUSE SAYS TO HOUSE

02:10:36.062 --> 02:10:41.033 region:rollup2
TO HOUSE SO WHAT AREA THE.

02:10:39.398 --> 02:10:42.201 region:rollup2
AVERAGE PRICE MAYBE.

02:10:41.033 --> 02:10:44.036 region:rollup2
THERE WAS CRIED DETERMINE THAT

02:10:42.201 --> 02:10:46.005 region:rollup2
DEALT WITH THAT THAT HAS QUALIFY

02:10:44.036 --> 02:10:47.440 region:rollup2
TEMPERS. BELOW. SO WE WOULD BE

02:10:46.005 --> 02:10:48.074 region:rollup2
DETERMINED BY THE FAIR MARKET

02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:50.509 region:rollup2
RENT.

02:10:48.074 --> 02:10:52.478 region:rollup2
SET BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE

02:10:50.509 --> 02:10:53.512 region:rollup2
FEDERAL EPARTMENT OF HOUSING

02:10:52.478 --> 02:10:54.013 region:rollup2
AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT SO FEDERAL

02:10:53.512 --> 02:10:56.449 region:rollup2
HIDE.

02:10:54.013 --> 02:10:57.783 region:rollup2
THEIR SAID EVERY FIVE YEARS AND.

02:10:56.449 --> 02:11:00.019 region:rollup2
THAT IS.

02:10:57.783 --> 02:11:01.620 region:rollup2
THAT IS THE BEST WAY WE FIGURED

02:11:00.019 --> 02:11:03.222 region:rollup2
OUT TO IT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT FOR

02:11:01.620 --> 02:11:04.757 region:rollup2
MARKET RENT IS. SO THE IDEAS

02:11:03.222 --> 02:11:07.226 region:rollup2
THAT WE PROVIDE A PROPERTY TAX

02:11:04.757 --> 02:11:09.061 region:rollup2
BREAK TO DEVELOPERS AYE IN ORDER

02:11:07.226 --> 02:11:10.129 region:rollup2
FOR THEM TO SET RENTS A BIT

02:11:09.061 --> 02:11:12.064 region:rollup2
LOWER THAN.

02:11:10.129 --> 02:11:13.799 region:rollup2
THEN THEN THE MARKET RENTS.

02:11:12.064 --> 02:11:15.668 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THIS

02:11:13.799 --> 02:11:16.936 region:rollup2
PORTION OF THE MARKET AND TO THE

02:11:15.668 --> 02:11:19.138 region:rollup2
POINT WHERE SPONSORS TO DO THIS

02:11:16.936 --> 02:11:21.307 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE CHEAPLY. THAN IT WOULD

02:11:19.138 --> 02:11:22.575 region:rollup2
COST US TO BUILD OTHER KINDS OF

02:11:21.307 --> 02:11:24.844 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

02:11:22.575 --> 02:11:28.080 region:rollup2
SO HOUSING DEVELOPERS MUST BE

02:11:24.844 --> 02:11:30.716 region:rollup2
NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS SO.

02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:32.318 region:rollup2
DOES. IT PROFIT. PROFIT

02:11:30.716 --> 02:11:33.386 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS WORKING IN

02:11:32.318 --> 02:11:35.287 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP WITH NONPROFIT

02:11:33.386 --> 02:11:36.889 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS SO THIS IDEA

02:11:35.287 --> 02:11:39.759 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY CAME TO ME FROM SOME

02:11:36.889 --> 02:11:41.927 region:rollup2
FOR PROFIT DEVELOPERS WHO REALLY

02:11:39.759 --> 02:11:43.329 region:rollup2
WANT TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS. OF

02:11:41.927 --> 02:11:45.464 region:rollup2
THE HOLLOWING OUT OF MIDDLE

02:11:43.329 --> 02:11:46.899 region:rollup2
CLASS RESIDENTS ARE IN SOME OF

02:11:45.464 --> 02:11:49.535 region:rollup2
THE MOST EXPENSIVE AREAS IN

02:11:46.899 --> 02:11:50.136 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. ARM AND WHAT WE'RE

02:11:49.535 --> 02:11:52.371 region:rollup2
SEEING IS THE HOUSING THAT'S

02:11:50.136 --> 02:11:53.506 region:rollup2
BEEN DEVELOPED. IS EITHER IS

02:11:52.371 --> 02:11:56.742 region:rollup2
ONLY AFFORDABLE TO VERY WEALTHY

02:11:53.506 --> 02:11:57.409 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS MARKET RATE HOUSING

02:11:56.742 --> 02:11:59.612 region:rollup2
OR A.

02:11:57.409 --> 02:12:01.180 region:rollup2
LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS QUALIFY

02:11:59.612 --> 02:12:02.548 region:rollup2
FOR CURRENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:12:01.180 --> 02:12:04.083 region:rollup2
BUT THE ENTIRE MIDDLE CLASS IS

02:12:02.548 --> 02:12:05.584 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY SHUT OUT OF OF THE

02:12:04.083 --> 02:12:06.619 region:rollup2
REGIONS SO. WE'RE TRYING TO

02:12:05.584 --> 02:12:07.920 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT HOW TO AND SCENTED

02:12:06.619 --> 02:12:09.355 region:rollup2
WITH THIS.

02:12:07.920 --> 02:12:11.657 region:rollup2
WITH WITH WITH THIS SITE WITH

02:12:09.355 --> 02:12:14.326 region:rollup2
THIS TAX INCENTIVE.

02:12:11.657 --> 02:12:16.729 region:rollup2
HOW WOULD IT HURT IF YOU OPEN UP

02:12:14.326 --> 02:12:18.531 region:rollup2
BUT ANY YOU KNOW?

02:12:16.729 --> 02:12:20.633 region:rollup2
FOR PROFIT OR NONPROFIT THE IF

02:12:18.531 --> 02:12:22.101 region:rollup2
THE MARKET RATE THAT THE CHARGES

02:12:20.633 --> 02:12:23.669 region:rollup2
OF TEMPUS AND BELOW THAT IS SO

02:12:22.101 --> 02:12:25.704 region:rollup2
GOOD WITH THE ENCOURAGEMENT FOR

02:12:23.669 --> 02:12:27.473 region:rollup2
ANYONE TO. CONSTRUCT MORE

02:12:25.704 --> 02:12:28.674 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE HOMES.

THAT NON PROFITS BE INVOLVED

02:12:38.717 --> 02:12:42.021 region:rollup2
