A WARM WELCOME BACK TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER CAN COOLEY. WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED TO THE COMMITTEE AGAIN WELCOME TO ALL OF THE LAST YEAR'S RETURNING? MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. WE HAVE TWO ITEMS ON THE AGENDA TODAY LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE WILL HEAR BILLS AND SIGN AN ORDER. IN OUR FIRST BILL WILL BE AB ONE THREE TWO FOUR WILL BEFORE I GO ANY FARTHER I'D LIKE TO HAVE. DIXIE CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. AGUIAR CURRY THEIR ANGER CURRY HERE WALDRON. BLOOM. BLOOM HERE COPY HERO KABIRA HERE COOLEY. COOLEY HERE EDUARDO GARCIA GRAYSON THEIR GRAYSON HERE LACKEY LACKEY HERE VOTE PARA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH UM I'D LIKE TO WELCOME ASSEMBLYMEMBER GRAYSON WHO IS. HELPING US OUT TODAY FOR TO PRESENT. MISTER ASSEMBLYMEMBER GLORIOUS BILL AB THIRTEEN TWENTY FOUR. WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO OPENING STATEMENT. YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLYMEMBER GLORIA. WE KNOW HOW DIVERSE CALIFORNIA CAN BE AND WE OFTEN HEAR ABOUT THE UNIQUE AND VERY NEEDS BETWEEN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OR COASTAL AND INLAND COMMUNITIES. BUT THOSE ARE BUT FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE BEEN. WHO HAVE SERVED ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT WE KNOW THOSE DIFFERENCES EXIST EVEN WITHIN THE SMALLER JURISDICTIONS THAT WE ONCE REPRESENTED ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO TRANSPORTATION? AS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS PLANNED FOR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS PROGRESS IS OFTEN STYMIED WHEN THE NEEDS OF ONE COMMUNITY DIFFER FROM THE NEEDS OF ITS NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES. UNFORTUNATELY NEITHER SUBREGION REALIZES ANY BENEFIT AND THE SAME FAILING INFRASTRUCTURE WHETHER IT BE TRANSIT OR ROAD REPAIRS GOES WITHOUT IMPROVEMENTS FOR ACTUALLY DECADES. AB THIRTEEN TWENTY FOUR SEEKS TO CHANGE THAT BY GRANTING REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AUTHORITIES AND METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS THE ABILITY TO ADVANCED IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS BY SUB REGION. UNDER THIS BILL RT PA'S AND NPOS WOULD BE ABLE TO EXERCISE THEIR EXISTING SALES TAX AUTHORITY IN SPECIFIC PORTIONS OF THEIR JURISDICTION. IF APPROVED BY THE REQUIRED NUMBER OF VOTERS COMMUNITIES WOULD BE THEN SHIRRED THAT THE DECISION TO TAX THEMSELVES WOULD NOT BE IN VAIN. AS THE REVENUES GENERATED FROM THE APPROVED SALES TAX WOULD BE AVAILABLE ONLY TO THOSE COMMUNITIES. ASSEMBLYMEMBER GLORIA THANKS THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR RAISING SOME OF THE CONCERNS AND THE ANALYSIS AND IS COMMITTED TO WORKING ON THOSE. IF THE BILL'S FORTUNE UP THE MOVE TO THE FLOOR. WITH ME I HAVE MARC WATTS ON BEHALF OF THE PLASTIC COUNTY REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY. THANK YOU A I'M SHARING MEMBERS APPRECIATE BEING HERE TODAY. PLUS FOR COUNTIES IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE A. AYE I COUNTY SUCH AS PLASTER HAS THREE DISTINCT. GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS HAVE GOT THE LAKE TAHOE AREA WHICH ALREADY HAS ITS OWN SPECIAL. TRANSPORTATION SALES TAX AUTHORITY TO IN IN AND OF ITSELF. AND THEN INTO WITHIN THE RENT WITHIN THE REST THE COW YOU'VE GOT THE FOOTHILLS AND. WHAT I CALL THE FLATLANDS BUT WOULD IT WITH THE? STAFF THAT THE AGENCY CALLED THE SUBURBAN AREAS OF PLASTER COUNTY. AND PUTTING IT TOGETHER TWO THIRDS VOTE MAJORITY PROGRAM WITH THOSE THREE DIVERSE. AREAS IS DIFFICULT AT BEST. WE THINK THIS BILL GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO. OF DEVELOP DISTRICT THAT MAKE SENSE FOR THE SUBURBAN AREAS AS WELL AS A SEPARATE. AT AT AT SOME OTHER TIME A SEPARATE. DISTRICT FOR THE FOOTHILLS WHERE IN THE PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS COULD BE MORE TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TO THE NEEDS THERE. AND ALLOW VOTERS TO. TO BOTH YOU SUPPORT THAT AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE FUNDS WILL BE RETAINED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE PROJECTS WITHIN THEIR. JURISDICTIONS SO ON THAT BASIS WE SUPPORT THIS MEASURE ENCOURAGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH JOHNSON CLAIMED AFTER THE CITY OF ENCINITAS ALSO IN SUPPORT. FROM A COASTAL CITY PERSPECTIVE AND SEEN DIEGO. BEING PART OF TO THE NORTH COUNTY TRANSIT AREA THERE'S PARTS OF THAT TRAIN TO DISTRICT THAT ARE. DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THE COASTAL CORRIDOR TRAINS BUT CITIES LIKE INSIDIOUS CARLSBAD AND OTHERS ON THAT OF COURT OR ARE DIRECTLY IMPACTED AND STRUGGLE WITH THE COSTS OF DOUBLE TRACKING OR DOING OTHER TYPES A GRADE SEPARATION TO. FEEL THE IMPROVETHE FLOW OF TRAFFIC THROUGH THEIR COMMUNITIES INTO NEED THIS IS. EMPLEADO EFFECTED BY THE TRAIN. HAVING THE ABILITY UNDER THIRTEEN TWENTY FOUR FOR COASTAL CITIES TO COME TOGETHER FOR THAT SPECIFIC ISSUE THE BILL TO CREATE A FUNDING MECHANISM. WE SEE A BENEFIT TO THAT AND IT'S SOMETHING WE'RE NOT SO SURE THAT SOME OF THEM REST OF REMEMBERS IN NORTH COUNTY WOULD DISAGREE WITH BECAUSE THEY DON'T THEY ARE DIRECTLY IMPACTED YESTER USERS OF THE THE TRANSIT DISTRICT AND THERE'S. ISSUES THAT ARE APPROPRIATELY MORE BROADLY FUNDED BUT THOSE CITIES SPECIFIC ESPECIALLY FOR GRADE CROSSINGS OTHER THINGS PART SOMETHING LIKE A CITY VINCE ESCONDIDO OTHER AREAS WERE NESTLE CARE ABOUT SO FOR THESE REASONS WE THINK THIS AYE MAKES SENSE WE UNDERSTAND THERE'S SOME. DIFFICULTIES AND HOW YOU STRUCTURE THIS BUT WE DO THINK THE IDEA IS. MERITORIOUS FOR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE ELSE AND WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. I AM VERY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OKAY SO ARE THERE QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. PACING NONE. AND KOKO HEAD. I'M SORRY. MADAM CHAIR I DO HAVE A QUESTION I JUST FROM. BASICALLY ONE AT PRETTY MUCH PUT ON THE RECORD THE CONVERSATION I HAD WITH MR GLORIA. APPRECIATE MR GRAYSON BEING HERE TODAY TO. TO. PRESENT THIS BILL BUT. THE CHALLENGE I HAVE IS THAT FROM UP FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS SAID WE SHOULD BE DOING OUR TRANSPORTATION. PLANNING ON A REGIONAL BASIS AND WE'VE SET UP A WHOLE INFRASTRUCTURE IN ORDER FOR THAT TO HAPPEN BECAUSE WE ONE IS THERE TO BE FREE FLOW. OF OF TRAFFIC FROM ONE COUNTY TO THE OTHER END ON IT IT IS AN EASY HAVING. TO WORK WITH YOUR NEIGHBOR COUNTIES WHO HAVE MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW OF THE VIEW OF THE WORLD BUT THE IDEA IS REGIONAL PLANNING I'M I'M. I M.. I THINK I REALLY THINK THANK THE TESTIMONY FROM CLASSIC COUNTY AND ALSO. FROM ENCINITAS BECAUSE THOSE THAT THERE WAS AN ARTICULATION OF A SPECIFIC ISSUE THAT'S LOCAL AND WHAT I TOLD MR GLORIA IS ON WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. IS. IT THERE'S ALWAYS FRICTION BETWEEN THE URBAN. AYE CENTERS AND THE MORE RURAL CENTERS AND THERE'S ALSO FRICTION BETWEEN POOR COMMUNITIES WHO RELY VERY HEAVILY MAYBE ON ONE FORM OF TRANSPORTATION AND THE WEALTHIER COMMUNITIES IT MAY NOT. AND I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT SETTING UP A THE POSSIBILITY OF CHERRY PICKING WHERE YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO TO. TO TO WIN A BALLOT MEASURE AND IT IT DOESN'T. IT. INSTEAD OF SAYING WE WANT TO INCENTIVIZE U. FIGURING OUT THE BIG PICTURE AND MEETING EVERYBODY'S NEEDS IT IT ALLOWS YOU TO DO AND JUST GET MORE PRO CABLE AND FOCUS ON THE NEEDS OF ONLY ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE AND I'M CONCERNED THAT IT LEAVES OUT AS A. AS A TRANSPORTATION PLANNER IT LEAVES OUT THE BIG PICTURE AND SO WHAT WHAT I TOLD HIM I'M A NO VOTE TODAY WHEN I TOLD HIM IS I'M WILLING TO CONSIDER A REGIONAL APPROACH TO IT WHERE IT'S GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM THAT'S. CREATED REGIONALLY I'M NOT SURE I'M READY TO MOVE. CHANGING THE HAVING A POLICY THAT'S. REALLY IN CONTRAVENTION OF WHAT WE'VE SET UP IN TERMS OF REGIONAL PLANNING SO. BUT THAT'S NOT THE BILL HERE TODAY IF THERE'S AN INTEREST IF YOU HAS AN INTEREST IN DOING THAT DOWN THE ROAD I'M MORE THAN MONEY TO TO LOOK AT THAT BUT. I'M JUST CONCERNED BECAUSE. RIGHT NOW. WHEN I LOOK AT MY REGION. ALL OF THE TRANSPORTATION NETWORK. THAT IS PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IS FROM SAN JOSE NORTH. AND AND IN AN INCLUDES A TRAIN SERVICE AND THEN TO THE SOUTH IT'S SAN LUIS OBISPO SOUTH. AND SO GUESS WHO'S RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE WITH ABSOLUTELY NO NO SERVICE AND BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANY JUICE IN THOSE TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES WORK WERE LEFT OUT AND SO THE REGIONAL APPROACH. IS THE ONLY WAY WE'RE EVER GOING TO GET CONNECTED AND SO. THAT THIS KIND OF FLIES IN EVERY SO I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE TODAY I AM AS I SAID I'M WILLING TO LOOK AT IT AND IT. AT AT LOCALIZED SPECIFIC TO MAYBE PLASTIC KANTIAN TO SAN DIEGO BUT I'M JUST NOT WANTING TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER OKAY. SO MEMBER WALDRON. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. HAVING SAT ON THE EARTH COUNTY TRANSIT BOARD FOR EIGHT YEARS. WHEN WE FIRST IMPLEMENTED THE COASTER AND. YOU KNOW SIGNED THE. THE THE FINANCING AGREEMENTS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY GET THAT GOING. ISSUES WITH THE. ENCINITAS THAT WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE DOUBLE TRACKING AND ALL OF THAT. THE DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES AND THEIR YOU KNOW WILLINGNESS TO WORK ON DOUBLE TRACKING PLUS THE ENVIRONMENTAL PLUS WORKING WITH. YOU KNOW ALL THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES TO GET THOSE THINGS DONE. I DON'T SEE HOW A REGIONAL TAXING APPROACH COULD EVEN. BEGIN THE GENERATE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO DO A GRADE SEPARATION OR SOMETHING. LIKE THAT SO I MEAN I AGREE. THE REGIONAL APPROACH WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL THE CONNECTIONS YOU NEED BUS CONNECTIONS YOU NEED ALL KINDS OF OTHER CONNECTIONS MULTI MODAL IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO. AND MAKE IT WORK I DON'T SEE HOW JUST DOING YOU KNOW WANTED TO CITIES OR EVEN JUST THE COLESLAW KARA WOULD BE ENOUGH TO GENERATE EVEN IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED TO DO. A FUNDING MECHANISM AND YOU KNOW. ONCE AGAIN WE WERE NORTH COUNTY TRANSIT DISTRICT THERE WAS MUCH AT ALL METROPOLITAN TRANSIT BOARD THEN THEY WERE BROUGHT TOGETHER AS ONE TO DO REGIONAL BELL THERE BEING SEPARATED BACK OUT AND SAY THAT IT'S LIKE. YOU KNOW LET'S MAKE A DECISION HOW DO WE WANT TO DO IT BECAUSE EVEN AT THIS HEARING I HAVE ASKED THE QUESTION WHAT HAPPENS IF WE HAVE A TAX. ON THE ON THE BALLOT AND ONLY ONE PART OF THE AREA DECIDES TO DO AND WE'RE GOING TO BUILD HALF A PLAN. AND THEY WERE LIKE WE DON'T KNOW THAT'S HOW IT'S PROBABLY GONNA SO I'M LOOKING AT THIS IS MAYBE A. WAY TO ADDRESS THAT BUT I STILL DON'T SEE HOW IT WOULD WORK ON A REGIONAL APPROACH SO. THAT'S MY CONCERN WITH IT. ANY OTHER DISCUSSION. OKAY. I NEED A MOTION. CLINTON RUSHED. IT'S ALL SECOND THE BILL. MOVE ALONG. OKAY. YOU HAVE ANY CLOSING STATEMENT. AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR OF HELPING US OUT TODAY HELP WAS TO LIE ABSOLUTELY MADAM CHAIR AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER GLORY OF SIMPLY ASKED WHEN I GO. THANK YOU. OKAY WORLD AND TAKE A VOTE DIXIE PLEASE. A MOTION IS TO PASS AGUIAR CURRY AYE AYE AGUIAR CURRY AYE WALDRON. WALDRON NO BLOOM. BLOOM AYE CABBIE HERO. COOLEY. COOLEY AYE EDUARDO GARCIA GRAYSON. GRAYSON AYE LACKEY. LACKEY NOVO PARA.

I WANNA. AREA TODAY WELL THANKS VERY MUCH GOOD. SO WE WILL. PLEASE OPEN WITH YOUR. SOME. YOUR OPENING STATEMENT. THANK VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR. I'M HERE DAY PRESENT EIGHTY NINE SIXTY TWO WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO DIVERSIFY THE FINANCING PORTFOLIO FOR THE PORT THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. INTERNATIONAL TRADE IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF OUR NATION'S ECONOMY AND CALIFORNIA'S PORTS PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN SERVING OUR NATION ST NEEDS. THE FACT MORE THAN FORTY PERCENT OF THE TOTAL CONTAINERIZED CARGO ENTERING UNITED STATES ARRIVES AT CALIFORNIA PORTS. AND ALMOST THIRTY PERCENT OF THE NATION'S EXPORTS FLOW THROUGH OUR PORTS AS WELL. TRADE IS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR R. CONNIE RELATING TO ALMOST TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OR ACCORDING TO MRS OVER TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. OF OUR ECONOMY. CORD ACTIVITIES EMPLOY MORE THAN HALF A MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA THEY ALSO GENERATE ESTIMATED NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN STATE AND LOCAL TAX REVENUE ANNUALLY. ARE IN ADDITION TO THE. BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF ALL OF OUR MONEY THAT'S CREATING JOBS IN THE LOCAL ECONOMIES. MAIL. SECOND. I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH I NINE SIX TWO IS IS VERY SIMPLY NEW AND INNOVATIVE WAY FOR CALIFORNIA TO SUPPORT OUR NATIONAL TRAIN CONNIE AND MAKE SURE THAT OUR PORTS REMAIN COMPETITIVE R. WITH INCREASED COMPETITION NOT ONLY NATIONALLY BUT INTERNATIONALLY. A COMES ON THE HEELS OF AB SIXTY THREE BY CENTER IS OR HALL IN TWENTY FIFTEEN OTHER ALSO CREATED OTHER FOR REPORT FINANCING OPPORTUNITIES. NINE SIXTY TWO ACCRETING NEW PUBLIC FINANCING PROGRAM TO ENCOURAGE FUTURE INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE I CALIFORNIA SEAPORTS TO ADMINISTERED BY THE STATE INFRASTRUCTURE BANK. AND WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE INTRODUCED ANDREW ANGELA FROM THE CIVIC MERCHANT SHIPPING ASSOCIATION. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU SOMEONE MEMBER ALLEN FOR REVIVING A PROPOSAL THAT WE FIRST BROUGHT YOU TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. OF THE PACIFIC MERCHANT SHIPPING ASSOCIATION IS THE MAJOR ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING THEIR INTERNATIONAL FIRMS THAT ARE THE LEAST TENANTS OF THE PUBLIC PORTS PUBLIC PORTS OUR STATE ASSETS. WE AT THE STATE LEVEL HAVE SET VERY SIGNIFICANT GOALS WITH RESPECT TO CLEANING GREENING OUR PORTS OF REDUCING CARBON EMISSIONS AND OTHER HARMFUL POLLUTANTS. AND IN MANY CASES WE'VE GONE IT'S A GREAT AMOUNT OF DETAIL ABOUT THE OUTCOMES THAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE. BUT WE NEED MORE WORK ON EXACTLY HOW WE WOULD SPUR THE INVESTMENT AND BE A PARTNER. IN THE INVESTMENT WITH THE PRIVATE A POOR TENANTS AND THE PUBLIC FORCE AS WELL. AND THIS PROPOSAL IS A WAY IN WHICH THE STATE CAN PARTNER AND REWARD PRIVATE PORT TENANTS THAT ALREADY HAVE EQUIPMENT INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT. WORKS FINE AND HAS A LONG SHELF LIFE BUT. BASED ON THE GOALS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR PLANS. WOULD BE UPGRADED. AT GREAT EXPENSE. ARE WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO MEET THESE GOALS TO CLEAN AND GREEN OUR COURTS BUT WE ALSO WANT TO PRESERVE ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS. PORTS AROUND THE WORLD AROUND THE COUNTRY ARE PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INCENTIVE FUNDS TO GO AFTER THE MUCH VALUED DISCRETIONARY CARVEL. A FORTY PERCENT OF THIS NATION'S CARGO R. GOES THROUGH THE PORTS OF LOS ANGELES AND LONG BEACH FOR DESTINATIONS OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. AND IT'S PART OF THE PRIDE FOR THE STATE THAT WE ARE SUCH A MAGNET FOR ECONOMIC ACTIVITY BUT. THERE'S NO GUARANTEE AND WHEN THE BENEFICIAL CARGO OWNERS ARE TARGETS THE WALMART THE HOME DEPOTS OF THE WORLD WHEN THEY MAKE A LOGISTICS DECISION TO MOVE THE CAR GO TO ANOTHER STATE IT DOESN'T COME BACK. AND FOR THESE REASONS WE THINK THIS IS A WIN WIN. WHERE WE DEPRIVE REPORT TENANTS WOULD MAKE AN INVESTMENT TO FRANKLY UPGRADED EQUIPMENT BEFORE ITS USEFUL LIFE? AND HAVE A PARTNERSHIP IN THE INVESTMENT WITH THE STATE AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE I WOULD LIKE TO JUST HAVE CLARIFICATION. MISTER COOLEY MADE THE MOTION. THERE ARE AMENDMENTS WITH THIS AND DOES THAT INCLUDE THEM AND. WE'VE ACCEPTED ALL AMENDMENTS THANKS VERY MUCH I THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY. THANK YOU. WAY HAVE MOTION AND WE HAVE ANY DISCUSSION. QUESTIONS WERE COMMITTEE YES WITH A MEMORABLE I HAVE I HAVE A COUPLE OF CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL THAT THE THE FIRST HAS SIGNED A BACK IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THIS WAS HELD IN APPROACH SAID AS A RESULT OF THE. ON SOME FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT COST CONCERNS AND I HAD AN OLD TO ALL OF YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT APPROACH SPEER. AYE I DON'T SEE ANY INDICATION THAT THOSE HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED. ON THE SECOND AND PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANT CONCERN THAT I HAVE IS. AYE AYE REALLY RESPECT THAT A PACIFIC MERCHANTS SHIPPING ASSOCIATION AND RESPECT THE FACT THAT THEY'RE IN SUPPORT OF THIS. BUT THIS IS ALSO. SUPPOSED TO BE BENEFICIAL TO ALL THE PORTS WHICH AND. THE AUTHOR STATEMENT ARE ARE A SET FORTH LONG BEACH LA OAKLAND PORT HUENEME THE RICHMOND. AND SAN DIEGO AND WE DON'T HAVE A SINGLE LETTER OF SUPPORT FROM A FROM ANY OF THOSE PORTS SO. I I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THAT COULD BE WORTH THE. WITH THIS BILL SO IT. UNLESS THERE'S A SATISFACTORY ANSWER FOR THAT I'M NOT PREPARED TO. DEVOTED THE. MAYBE FOR A QUESTION ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM. WE THOUGHT THE BILL IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM REALLY HAS CHECKS AND BALANCES THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN THIS VERSION THE BILL. MEETING AFTER REPORT SUBMITS AN APPLICATION TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE BANK. THE INFRASTRUCTURE BANK CARDS AS OWN INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT TO AN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT TO PROJECTED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY MEETING SALES TAX REVENUE AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. IS VERIFIED AND LEGITIMATE AND EVEN AFTER THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS TO TAKE A SECONDARY ACT TO APPROPRIATE THE FUNDS SO THERE ARE CHECKS AND BALANCES AND VERIFICATION. TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THIS INVESTMENT IS GOING TO HAVE ONE THE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS THAT'S BUILT INTO WHAT THE BILL BILL AUTHORIZES BUT THEN THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF THE STATE. NOTHING HAPPENS UNTIL THE LEGISLATURE MAKES THE FINAL THEY STILL CONTROL THE POWER THE PERKS THEY MAKE THE FINAL DECISION. ON WHETHER NOT APPROPRIATION IS LEGITIMATE EVEN AFTER THE INFRASTRUCTURE BANK AND THE PUBLIC POOR HAS APPROVED. AS FAR AS I THE TIMING OF LETTERS OF SUPPORT YOU KNOW FROM OTHER PORTS I THINK YOU KNOW IF THE BILL'S ALLOWED TO MOVE FORWARD. AND STANFORD AND HOPEFULLY WE GET FURTHER THAN APPROPRIATIONS THIS TIME. WE ANTICIPATE THAT AS MORE PRO SPORTS BECOME AWARE THEY WILL BE IN SUPPORT AND I WILL MENTION THAT. PACIFIC MERCHANT SHIPPING ASSOCIATION REPRESENTS TERMINAL OPERATORS ALSO TO THE COASTLINE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE WESTERN UNITED STATES. I MEAN I I I APPRECIATE THE DESCRIPTION OF THE STRUCTURE THE BILL AND HOW IT WORKS AND. IF THE BILL MOVES FORWARD I THINK ASSUME THEIR PROPS APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE WILL TAKE A SECOND LOOK AT IT TO FROM THAT FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE. I. THE THE BILL WAS SO FIRST HER BACK IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. SO AGAIN OF. THAT'S PRETTY LONG PERIOD OF TIME. FOR WHICH TOOK AGAINST PORT TO AND. EITHER LETTERS OF EXPRESSION OF INTEREST OR OPPOSITION OR SUPPORT FROM A. UP FROM ALL THE SAID VERY SPORTS IN THE CITY AND AND OTHER INTERESTS AND SEEING NO SUPPORT AT ALL HERE EXCEPT FOR. PACIFIC MERCHANT SHIPPING ASSOCIATION GIVES ME. ON SOME LEVEL OF CONCERN. MAY YET BE SOMETHING BECAUSE THEY SHOULD MOVE FORWARD BUT I'D LIKE THERE TO BE A TO SEE MORE COLLABORATIVE EFFORT ON. THANK YOU ON ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YES AT A. ASSEMBLY RECOVERY ARROW. I HAVE A. A FEW QUESTIONS. IN NIGHT IT YOU MAY ACTUALLY HAVE ANSWERED THE QUESTION. IN REGARDS TO THAT THAT TO. ECONOMIC IMPACT REPORTS THAT. ANTICIPATED IN HERE. I WAS IN I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE COST UP THE FIRST IT'S THE IT'S THE THEIR REPORT. IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S IT'S THE REPORT THAT'S COMMISSIONED BY THE PORT AUTHORITY AND THEN THE SECOND ONE WOULD BE COMMISSIONED BY THE AYE BANK SCRATCH AT THE PENTAGON ASSEMBLYMEMBER. OKAY. AND AND I AM AND I'M RIGHT ANY OTHER MEAN TO GET TECHNICAL BUT HAVING WORKED IN THE ADMINISTRATION SOME OF THE WORDING BECOMES IMPORTANT BECAUSE IN YOU GOTTA FOLLOW THE WORDING THAT THE LETTER OF THE LAW AND. AND MY CONCERN WAS PEER REVIEWED IN AND. PEER REVIEWED BECAUSE PARA VIEW ANTICIPATES IN SENATOR SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AND THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN JUST HAVING ANOTHER ECONOMIST FOR EXAMPLE LOOKING AT. AT AT THE REPORT IN ANALYZING IT AND AND GIVING THEIR OWN OPINIONS SO I'M I'M A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ABOUT THAT THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD. SO I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE COST OF THAT. THE. THE BILL SAYS THAT THE HARBOR AGENCY WILL. ON. AB REIMBURSE THE AYE BANK FOR. THEY'RE IN ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND USUALLY ONE HAVE A MAXIMUM SO THAT. THE IBM CAN SEE BY THE WAY THIRTY PERCENT OR YOU KNOW A NUMBER THAT'S REALLY HIGH. I WOULD RECOMMEND SOME NUMBER THAT'S AN ADMINISTRATIVE NUMBER THAT MAKE SENSE BY A AYE AYE M.. I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE AYE BANK USES AS THE RULE OF THUMB BUT IT WOULD BE GOOD TO KNOW THAT AND THEN THE OTHER ISSUE I HAD ON. WHICH. UP YOU KNOW KIND OF THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS IS THE ISSUE RELATED TO PURCHASING EQUIPMENT. FOR A PRIVATE PARTY. THAT IT THEN OWNS AND OPERATES THAT EQUIPMENT. THAT THEN BECOMES OF THE PROPERTY OF THE STATE WHEN THEY'RE DONE WITH IT AND. IT AND I GUESS THE CONCERN ABOUT IT IS A BIT IF IF IT'S PAID. IF THERE'S PROPERTY THAT'S PESO BUT LIKE RENTING RENTERS DON'T TAKE VERY GOOD CARE OF THE PLACES THEY RENTED A GENERAL. IF THEY TAKE A LOT MORE CARE OF IT IF IT'S THEIR OWN IF THEY PAID THEIR OWN MONEY FOR IT SO I'M CONCERNED WITH WITH USING THAT PUBLIC RESOURCES TO THEN. GET EQUIPMENT. AND THAT. THE WET WITH OUT THERE BEING A REQUIREMENT THAT THEY MAINTAIN IT AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL SO THAT IT REALLY HAS MAINTAINED ITS VALUE AND IT'S GOT SOME. SO IT'S SO THAT IS PROTECTED AGAINST IT SO THE ACID IS PROTECTED AND. SO I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AS WELL AND THAT'S OBVIOUS SOMETHING YOU PUT IN A CONTRACT BUT I WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S. THAT THE INVESTMENT IN STATE. WHEN IF YOU'RE USING STATE FUNDS THAT YOU'RE PROTECTING THAT INVESTMENT. SO CHAIR. THANK YOU SO IN EVERY QUESTIONS ON YOUR FIRST QUESTION ABOUT THE COST YOU KNOW THERE'S A TENSION. IN THE DESIGN OF THE BILL BETWEEN HAVING INFRASTRUCTURE BANKS COME COSTS BE REIMBURSED BY THE PORCH BUT THEN WITH WITH A CAP ON THAT THEN THE INFRASTRUCTURE BANK HAS COSTS THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE PAID FOR. BY THE GENERAL FUND AND SO WE DESIGNED THE BILL SO THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE BANK IN REVIEWING THE APPLICATIONS THAT ARE INITIATED BY THE COURTS. WOULD BE ABLE TO THEN SUBMIT THEIR COST TO THE PORCH WHO ARE SEEKING APPROVAL FROM THE STATE. FOR THIS KIND OF THE FINANCING ARRANGEMENT. BUT WE'D LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF TO COME UP WITH SOME BETTER RIGHT DESIGNS ON THAT BUT THAT WAS KIND OF OUR BEST APPROACH TO. ADDRESS THE COST ISSUE. AND THEN SECONDLY WHAT'S. SO IF I COULD ON THE INVESTMENT BANK UP THEY DON'T USE THEY DON'T THEY DON'T GET INFUSIONS OF GENERAL FUND HAVE IT THEY'VE THERE THEY HAVE A REVOLVING ACCOUNT THAT THEY USE RIGHT AND SO. WEREN'T. IT'S NOT ANTICIPATE IN OTHER WORDS THE MONEY WOULD HAVE TO COME OUT OF THIS. GRANT BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO TO IDENTIFY FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE HOW MUCH DOES IT COST YOU TO DO IT ALONE. BECAUSE. EITHER DON'T GET IT BACK IN THE LOAN PROCESS USUALLY AND IF THIS IS THE GRANT. PROGRAM THEN THEY DON'T GET IT BACK IN THE LOAN IT'S A GRANT AND THEN WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE COST IS. AND GENERALLY SPEAKING THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS USUALLY END IN BILLS ARE ANYWHERE FROM. MEET THEY'RE USUALLY NOT MORE THAN FIFTEEN PERCENT SO I WOULD FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE IN THIS KIND OF A PROCESS HAVING A NUMBER. AND YOU AND I WOULD ADVISE WORKING WITH THE I. BANK BECAUSE THEY'LL HAVE THAT NUMBER IN TERMS OF HOW. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE LOAN THE END UP? EITHER HOLDING BACK OR USING AS RESOURCES TO PAY THEMSELVES SO. SO. TYPOGRAPHY READING AND HEARING THE AUTHOR. IMMIGRANT GOOD POINTS ABOUT HAVING SOME GUIDELINES YOU KNOW FOR LIMITATIONS ON ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THE POINT OF THIS BILL AND WE DIDN'T BRING IDEA FOR IT IN. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ARE NOW TO HAVE YOU KNOW TOO MANY RESOURCES GOAL TORIES OVERHEAD WE WANT. THIS TO BE A FINANCING PROGRAM TO GET GREENER CLEAR PROJECTS AT PORTSMOUTH SUPPORT EQUIPMENT WHICH IS IN KEEPING WITH THE STATE'S GOALS. IN A SUSTAINABLE AFRAID ACTION PLAN AN EXECUTIVE ORDER ISSUED BY THE GOVERNOR. SO WE WOULD VERY MUCH WORK WITH YOU TO TAKE YOUR ADVICE AND TRY TO GET SOME FEEDBACK. FROM THE INFRASTRUCTURE BANK ON EXACTLY HOW THE DESIGN THAT WILL WOULD BE AN ACCEPTABLE. LIMITATION ON WITH RESPECT TO ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ON THAT. VERY HAPPY TO DO THAT THE NINETY SECOND POINT ABOUT. THE. MAINTENANCE OF THE EQUIPMENT OVER TIME. THE PORT SIR PUBLIC ASSETS OF THE STATE THE PUBLIC PORTS IN A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OWN OPERATE THESE. ASSETS BASICALLY ENTRUST. THE TIDE LINES ACT WOULD STAY TO CALIFORNIA AND THEY SET STANDARDS FOR. THE MEMBER COMPANIES OF PMSA WHO ARE THE ACTUAL TERMINAL OPERATORS. ON MANY MANY THINGS INCLUDING. GOOD WORKING ORDER OF THE EQUIPMENT BUT ALSO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THAT EQUIPMENT. AND WHAT THIS BILL IS FOCUSED ON IS TRYING TO GET THE PORCH TO INVEST EARLIER THAN THEY MAY HAVE OTHERWISE WOULD TO BUY CLEANER GREENER ZERO MISSIONS EQUIPMENT. SOONER THEN THE OTHER WOULD BASED ON THE USEFUL LIFE OF WHAT'S CURRENTLY ON THE PART PROPERTY NOW. AND THESE ARE THE INCENTIVES OF WE SAT THROUGH LEGISLATION TO REGULATORY GOALS AND PUBLIC DOLLARS HAVE BEEN INVESTED IN FORKS AND IMPORTANT WITH MEN. FROM. THIS SOURCE THAT WE'RE PROPOSING FROM GIGI R. F. DOLLARS FROM CARL MOYER FUNDS THAT ARE DISPUTED BY THE AIR DISTRICTS AND MANY OTHER SOURCES TO SO THERE'S. A LOT OF PRECEDENT FOR HAVING THE PUBLIC INCENTIVIZE AND HARDER INVESTING IN CLEANER EQUIPMENT COURTS. THREE GOOD. MEN IN THEM ONE LAST ISSUE THAT IN TERMS OF THE LAND COMMISSION. IT THAT THEY CAN OBJECT AND THAT CATCH THINKS THE WHOLE DEAL AND I WAS WONDERING IF THERE'S A WAY TO DO THAT FIRST. ARE YOU ANTICIPATING THEM LOOKING AT THE ECONOMIC. BUT REPORT AS WELL OR IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT. IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A KILL SWITCH. THE EARLIER IT IS BEFORE YOU SPEND MONEY THE BETTER. AND. AND THAT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE STATE LANDS IS THE KILL SWITCH. THEY ARE THE KILL SWITCH IN THE END OF THE PORCH BASICALLY HAVE SUBORDINATE A DELEGATED AUTHORITY FROM THE LAST MISSION. AND SO. WE DIDN'T FORMALLY RIGHT A ROLE ON THE FRONT END BECAUSE WE THINK THE LAST COMMISSION TYPICALLY THE ROLE THEY PLAY IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT. IT'S AN APPROPRIATE USE OF THE LAND AND FOR ANY TERMINAL OR ANY ACTIVITY ON TIGHTLY AS PROPERTY. MAINTAINED LOCALLY THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS TODAY. WE'VE SEEN BILLS IN THIS COMMITTEE ON THIS QUESTION BEFORE. AND SO. WE'VE EITHER THAT PROCESS WOULD WORK WITH IF THERE'S A FURTHER CONCERN WE CAN TRY AND ADDRESS THAT. BUT I THINK WE HAVE THE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS DONE INITIALLY BY THE PORT AS AN AGENT OF THE STATE. THROUGH THE THAILAND'S ACT AND HAVE THEM THERE HAS TO BE VERIFIED BY INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT THAT'S NOT ON THE PAYROLL OF. THE TERMINAL OPERATOR OR THE POOR TO DETERMINES THE NUMBERS ARE CORRECT IN THE GULF THEIR. OKAY AYE AYE I NEED TO THINK THROUGH THAT WHOLE DELEGATED AUTHORITY BECAUSE IT IT SEEMS TO ME IF IT'S DELEGATED AUTHORITY UNLESS IT'S AN ABUSE OF DISCRETION THEY CAN'T. BE THE KILL SWITCH. BECAUSE THEY DELEGATED SO I AM I AM ANYTHING ABOUT AND I JUST I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IT. A WAY TO BE ABLE TO. THERE IS A SECTION A BILL THAT SAYS LAWRENCE COMMISSION WILL DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT YET AND THAT IS WHAT THAT'S WHAT I SAW AND IT IT JUST SEEMS TO ME. AFTER YOU'VE HIRED THE ECONOMIST AND GONE THROUGH THIS WHOLE PROCESS. IF YOU EAT YOU IF YOU JUST TAKE TO THEN HAVE. HAVING THE RUG PULLED OUT FROM UNDER WHEN THERE'S BEEN THIS YOU KNOW LIKE PATHWAY LET. I THINK THEY MAY BE THAT ARE YOU KNOW YOU KNOW I INTERNET SAYING YEAH I'M IN THAT THERE'S SO MUCH BUREAUCRACY SOMETIMES DRIVES ME CRAZY AND I KNOW THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING AT IT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO YOU. HOW DO YOU BE A HOW DO YOU WORK IN PARTNERSHIP IN THE I GUESS MAYBE THAT'S THE ANSWER I I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND A QUESTION I THINK YOU KNOW CHIT TO KINDA REFOCUS WHAT THE BILL DOES? THE BILL CREATES A NEW FINANCING. RIGHT FACILITY FOR PORTS IN THIS IS FOR YOU TO A LOT OF PORTS WILL HAVE OLDER EQUIPMENT THAT HAS YOU KNOW MANY YEARS MILLION DECADES OF SERVICE LIFE LEFT ON IT BUT MAYBE IT'S DIESEL EQUIPMENT RIGHT ANY ACCORDING TO OUR NEW MISSIONS MANDATES AND HER SCHOOLS STATES THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE ONE AGREED OUR PORTS MAYBE THEY WANT TO BUY SOME NEW WERE. YOU MORE FISHING EQUIPMENT THAT IS ZERO EMISSIONS ETCETERA. THIS GIVES THE OPERATOR THE ABILITY TO PARTNER WITH THE STATE TO PURCHASE EQUIPMENT. BOB OBVIOUSLY THEY WILL BE THE ONES BEARING THE COST AND IT'S REALLY INCUMBENT UPON THEM TO MAKE THE CASE TO GET THE FACILITY THAT WHEN YOUR TIME OF THE KILL SWITCH THE STATE LANDS. I THINK STATE LANDS WANTS TO BE KIND OF A IN THE LAST IN THE LINE THEY DON'T HAVE TO LOOK AT IN THE BEGINNING WHEN IT'S NOT REALLY CqC TO WHO THEY WANT SICK AGAIN BRING US THE WHOLE DEAL BEFORE IT'S ALL THAT WE IN WHEN IT'S ALL DONE. AND WRAPPED UP. AND THEN WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO. EXCEPT THIS OR OR DENY THIS WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT SIMPLY GIVES US THE ABILITY TO DO A NEW FACILITY. SO IT GIVES OUR PORTS THE ABILITY TO STAY COMPETITIVE WITH ALL THE OTHER PORTS ARE COMPETING FOR BUSINESS NOW WHETHER THAT OF MEXICO OR. YOU UP UP IN THE NORTHERN STATES TO US OR EVEN ON YOU KNOW THAT THE TEXAS COAST AROUND ARE ON THE EAST COAST. IT AND THAT REALLY IS THE KEY IS THAT OUR COURTS ARE FALLING BEHIND IN BUSINESSES GOING ELSEWHERE AND SO CENTER IS OR HALL BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN SAW THIS AND SAID LOOK YOU KNOW OUR PORTS NEED EXTRA. RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO STAY COMPETITIVE ANSWER HE HAD DONE A BILL THIS ACTUALLY FURTHERS THAT IT CREATES A NEW FACILITY. AND AND IT DOESN'T YOU'D MENTION A COUPLE OF GREAT POINTS ABOUT YOU KNOW THE COSTS INVOLVED IN HOW WHICH WOULD BE ADMINISTRATIVE COST BE IT CETERA. ALL OF THESE WOULD BE AGREED UPON BY THE ACTUAL POOR OPERATORS AND THE PORTS THEMSELVES PRIOR TO THE DEALS GOING THROUGH SO I I ACTUALLY SHARE YOUR CONCERN OF YOU KNOW BUREAUCRATIC RED TAPE. AND COST ULTIMATELY TO THE PORTS BUT YOU KNOW THIS WOULD BE THE OPENING THAT THE LANE IF YOU WILL AND THEN IT WOULD BE UP TO THE PORCH DECIDE AND POOR OPERATORS YES WE DO WANT TO. YOU KNOW TRY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE THIS FACILITY TO GET THIS DEAL DONE AND SO THEY WOULD BASICALLY MAKE SURE THAT THE DEAL WAS ACCEPTABLE FOR THEM. BEFORE IT AS THROUGH THE PROCESS THAT WAS BROUGHT THROUGH THE STATE AGENCIES AND THEN OF COURSE THE STATE STILL HAS THE ABILITY WITH THE STATE LANDS AND AND THE OTHER IDENTITIES. TO SHUT YOU KNOW ANY OF THESE DEALS NOW THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE DEALS BUT IT OPENS UP A LANE THAT DOESN'T EXIST RIGHT NOW. AND WE TAKE A LOOK AT AYE SO MY DISTRICT I HAVE. ALL OR PARTS ABOUT THIRTEEN CITIES INCORPORATING OF INCORPORATING ORANGE COUNTY BUT I ENDED THE ARM LA LINE SO I GO RIGHT UP TO THE LONG BEACH LINE. AND WE HAVE UNIT THE TO THOUGH THE LARGE SPORTS IN THE COUNTRY LEN LONG BEACH RIGHT THERE. AND SO THOSE ARE RIGHT OUTSIDE MY DISTRICT A LOT OF SUPPORT WORKERS LIVE RIGHT IN MY DISTRICT. AND YOU KNOW WITH THE NUMBERS WE STARTED WE STAYED IN THE BEGINNING ABOUT FORTY PERCENT OF THE CONTAINERIZED CARGO GOING THROUGH OUR PORTS. THIS IS A VERY VERY BIG DEAL AND HUGE CONTRIBUTE NOT STATE TO OUR LOCAL ECONOMY IN MY DISTRICT BUT TO THE ENTIRE STATE'S ECONOMY. AND WHAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IS ONE WHICH WE PRESERVE THIS BUSINESS FORCE YOU TO CALIFORNIA LAWMAKERS GOOD YOU'LL FOR THE PORT OPERATORS FOR THE PORTS. AND FOR THE STATE ALL THE SAME TIME BUT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW GIVE THESE PORTS AIRPORT OPERATORS THE ABILITY TO UPGRADE THEIR EQUIPMENT. TO MAKE THEMSELVES MORE EFFICIENT MORE GREEN TO KEEP UP WITH ALL THE NEW STATE REGULATIONS BUT ALSO. TO HAVE THE BEST PORT FACILITIES THAT CAN OFFER THE BEST EXPERIENCE TO THEIR END USERS THEIR CLIENTS SO WE CAN KEEP THIS BUSINESS FLOWING THROUGH CALIFORNIA FOR A WHOLE ECONOMY. IT'S I I TOTALLY AGREE WITH EVERYTHING YOU'RE SAYING AND I THINK THAT PMSA IS MORE THAN WILLING TO SIT OUT AS AM I. IT ANYTHING YOU WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT. TO MAKE SURE THERE'S A FAIR PROCESS FOR THE POOR OPERATORS AND FOR THE STATE I THINK WE'VE DONE A LOT OF THAT WORK YOU KNOW AS WE'VE GONE THROUGH HIS. THIS BILL IS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR QUITE SOMETIME NOW. ARE BUT I I ACTUALLY WELCOME THAT AND IF USUALLY RIGHT IN THAT TO. ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOMS POINT ABOUT THE LETTERS OF SUPPORT OF VARIOUS PORTS. WE WE HAVE WORKED WITH PMSA UP PRINCIPALLY ON THIS BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE ON PORT OPERATIONS AT THE VARIOUS PORTS IT'S A THEY ACTUALLY REPRESENT THE END USERS THAT ARE YOU USING THESE. BUT AS THIS BILL KIND OF GETS MORE LEGS UNDERNEATH IT THAT'S GOTTEN THAT WAS WHAT WE WERE KIND OF WAITING FOR BEFORE YOU'RE ENGAGING THE POTS BUT IT IS AN EXCELLENT POINT SOMEWHER BLOOM AND I THINK THAT ALL OF THE PORTS. AYE IT LEASE ALL OF ONE'S LIFE IT INFORMAL CONVERSATIONS WITH I'M I'M GUESSING AND YOU DON'T SPEAK THIS ARE IN FAVOR OF THIS AS WELL BECAUSE IT JUST CREATES YOU KNOW AN ABILITY FOR US TO INCREASE OUR INVESTMENT. INTO OUR PORTS WHICH MAKES THEM MORE COMPETITIVE AVE DOES IT TIE ANYBODY'S HANDS IT JUST GIVES THEM ANOTHER TOOL THESE. PRECIADO THINKS. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE. YES. OF SOMERVELL PELVIC. I SUPPORT THIS BILL. AND HERE'S THE REASON. WE'VE. BEN IN A RECOVERY FOR NINE YEARS. TIMES HAVE BEEN GOOD. OUR BUDGET LOOKS GOOD. SUPPOSEDLY. THEN I DON'T USE THAT WORD POLITICALLY. SUPPOSEDLY WE OF A NINE TEAM POINT THREE BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS RIGHT NOW IN THE BANK. AND THE REASON I USETHE WORD SUPPOSEDLY IS NOT YOU GOTTA COUNTED UP. DON'T KNOW COULD BE A LITTLE BIT OFF. DON'T KNOW. WE WILL HAVE A RECESSION. NO DOUBT. ALWAYS COMES. AND THIS NEXT RECESSION MAY BE VERY STRANGE. BECAUSE OF THEIR POLITICAL SITUATION OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA DON'T KNOW. SO I SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE. IN MY MILITARY EXPERIENCE. WHEN NO ONE'S. SHOOTING AT YOU YOU DIG DEEPER. YOU PILE UP MORE AMMO. I PUT MORE. CHAO WITH. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. OKAY IF I GOT IT. SO. I SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE WE SHOULD REINFORCE OUR PORT SYSTEM. BEFORE EVERYTHING GETS SOME REALLY WEIRD IN THIS COUNTRY. THAT WAY WE CAN SUPPORT A HIGHER LEVEL. OF IMPORTS AND EXPORTS. THEN OTHER COUNTRIES BECAUSE. THE NEXT RECESSION BECOMES WILL BE WORLD WIDE. AND CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO COMPETE. BOTTOM. AND THE TOP. SO I THINK THIS THING. PRETTY DARN GOOD. AND MY LAST WORDS ARE. LET'S HOPE THE BIG RECESSION TAX INCOME BUT WE GOTTA BE READY. MA'AM. MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR COMMITTEE. SINGER WHICH I TO CLOSE SOME REMEMBER ABSOLUTELY A IN THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO VERY VOCAL YEAH I THINK IT DIDN'T REALLY WHAT THIS RELATES IS MAKING SURE THAT OUR PORTS ARE ASKING HAD OF THIS POSSIBLE. AND I THINK THE SIMPLY MEMBERS POINT. THIS IS YOU KNOW THIS JUST CREATES THE FACILITY THIS WE BACKED UP BY THE PORT OPERATORS AND AND THAT THE PAYEES. ARE WHO HAVE AN EXCELLENT TRACK RECORD OF MAKING SURE THAT ALL OF THEIR PAYMENTS ARE MADE. OF IT OF COURSE THE STATE HAS COMPLETE DISCRETION ON HOW YOU KNOW HOW THIS FACILITIES USE BUT IT JUST CREATES AN AVENUE WHERE WE CAN CONTINUE TO OPERATE OUR PORTS TO MAKE THE NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT. YOU REST ASSURED OTHER STATES ARE DOING THE SAME THING AND OTHER ECONOMIES IT YEAH OTHER NATIONS ARE DOING THE SAME THING TO DIRECTLY COMPETE WITH CALIFORNIA TO TAKE BUSINESS AWAY FROM OUR PORTS. SENATOR THEIR PORS TAKE OUR JOBS FROM FROM OUR PORTS AND SEND IT OVER THERE IT WHETHER IT'S NORTH OR SOUTH OR EAST OF US. THIS JUST MAKES SENSE. IT MAKES SENSE FOR ALL OF OUR PORTS IT MAKES SENSE FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA FOR JOBS FOR MAKING SURE THERE ARE CONNIE STRONG AND VIBRANT AND THAT WE GET TO USE OUR GEOGRAPHIC RESOURCES. OF HAVING THESE INCREDIBLE PORTS WHICH WE BUILT UP FOR DECADES AT ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN THAT WORK THERE. AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY REMAIN VIABLE AN EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE NOT JUST NOW BUT INTO THE FUTURE AND AT THE SAME TIME ARE ARE ALSO AMONG THE MOST EFFICIENT. THE GREENEST IN THE LOWEST EMISSIONS ARE IN THE ENTIRE NATION AND IS THE VERY LAST POINT ALL BRING UP. YOU KNOW I'M A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GUY BORN AND RAISED I'VE LIVED IN HIKES BEACH FOR LAST COUPLE DECADES. AND I'VE SAT HERE THE LEGISLATURE LAST SIX YEARS AND A LOT OF WHAT WE GET YOUR ABOUT BOBBY SEES AIR POLLUTION RIGHT AND WE'RE ALL VERY SENSITIVE TO. THE FACT THAT MANY PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA LIVING AREAS WITH VERY BAD AIR QUALITY. AND AS WE KNOW THIS TYPICALLY CENTERS AROUND YOU KNOW. HUBS OF ACTIVITY SUCH AS PORT SUCH AS FREEWAYS IVES'S LOT OF ACTIVITY GOING BACK AND FORTH THE MORE MONEY THAT WE CAN INVEST INTO OUR PORTS THE GREATER THEY CAN BECOME THE LESS EMISSIONS WILL BE PRODUCING. WHICH MEANS A BETTER AIR QUALITY FOR EVERYBODY LIVES AROUND THERE THE BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE IS NOT JUST ABOUT YOU KNOW PEOPLE GETTING THEIR JOBS IN OUR ECONOMY DOING GREAT WHICH OF COURSE BENEFITS ALL OF US. THIS IS ALSO ABOUT IMPROVING THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH ALL CALIFORNIANS LIVE ESPECIALLY THOSE PEOPLE LIVE NEAR PORTS BECAUSE IS DIRECTLY. PEOPLE WILL BE IMPACTED IN A VERY FAVORABLE WAY. SO I THINK IT'S IT'S A WIN WIN WIN FOR THE STATE IT'S A WIN FOR YOU KNOW ALL OF OUR PORTS IN THE PORT WORKERS AND COMPANIES IN BUSINESS THERE. BUT IT'S ALSO WIN FOR THE PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW LIVE IN THE VICINITY AND WILL BE THE BENEFICIARIES OF AN IMPROVED ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE WE'VE APPROVE THIS BILL TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
