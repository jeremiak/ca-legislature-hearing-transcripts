PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU I

00:13:08.854 --> 00:13:10.990
THINK ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT

00:13:11.056 --> 00:13:12.224
I HAD I KNOW THAT THERE ARE

00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:13.926
OTHER FOLKS THAT HAVE A NUMBER

00:13:13.993 --> 00:13:16.162
OF PROCEDURAL CONCERNS THAT

00:13:16.228 --> 00:13:19.231
THIS IS A POLICY BILL- IN THE

00:13:19.298 --> 00:13:23.502
MIDST OF A- CALL BUDGET BILL

00:13:23.569 --> 00:13:25.571
BUT MY QUESTION TO YOU IS. WHEN

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:27.907
YOU HAVE BUSINESSES THAT ARE

00:13:27.973 --> 00:13:29.875
SEEKING TO RE OPEN. I KNOW

00:13:29.942 --> 00:13:31.443
THERE'S A NATURAL INCENTIVE FOR

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:34.880
THEM TO WANT TO RE HIRE- FROM

00:13:34.947 --> 00:13:36.582
THEIR PREVIOUS TALENT POOL. I

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:38.284
THINK THE INCLINATION IS WHAT

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:40.052
IS ALREADY THERE. BUT ONE OF

00:13:40.119 --> 00:13:43.556
THE CONCERN I HAVE. IS THAT. IF

00:13:43.622 --> 00:13:45.624
THIS IS BASED ON SENIORITY THE

00:13:45.691 --> 00:13:48.761
REHIRING IS BASED ON SENIORITY.

00:13:48.827 --> 00:13:51.030
WHAT IF THE WHAT IS THE

00:13:51.096 --> 00:13:52.831
BUSINESS FOR EXAMPLE WANTED TO

00:13:52.898 --> 00:13:54.200
HIRE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN

00:13:54.266 --> 00:13:57.870
VACCINATED. FIVE SO HOW WOULD

00:13:57.937 --> 00:14:00.839
THAT FIT INTO A PRIORITY LIST-

00:14:00.906 --> 00:14:04.143
WITH A BILL LIKE THIS. CENTER

IN THE PROVISIONS HOWEVER. THE

00:14:13.686 --> 00:14:15.521
EMPLOYEE THAT IS ELIGIBLE FOR

00:14:15.588 --> 00:14:16.655
RE HIRE MUST BE AN EMPLOYEE WHO

00:14:16.722 --> 00:14:18.891
HAD THAT JOB WE'RE VERY

00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.260
COMPARABLE JOB AND WORKED FOR

00:14:21.327 --> 00:14:25.164
AT LEAST SIX MONTHS SO THEY A

00:14:25.231 --> 00:14:25.831
EMPLOYEE WITH QUOTE UNQUOTE

00:14:25.898 --> 00:14:30.069
SENIORITY. FIFTY FIFTY SECTOR

00:14:30.135 --> 00:14:31.904
THAT THIS AFFECTS. MUCH THREE

00:14:31.971 --> 00:14:33.505
HIGHER IN A DIFFERENT CATEGORY

00:14:33.572 --> 00:14:36.575
OF JOB. SOMEONE WITH SENIORITY

00:14:36.642 --> 00:14:38.844
IN A NOTHER JOB DOES NOT GET

00:14:38.911 --> 00:14:41.580

MADAM PRESIDENT I MAY REAFFIRM

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:56.395
I THINK THE QUESTION IS WHAT IF

00:14:56.462 --> 00:14:58.631
THE EMPLOYER WISH TO IMPLEMENT

00:14:58.697 --> 00:15:00.933
A POLICY ON PUBLIC HEALTH

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.035
GROUNDS THAT THE PREFERENCE IS

00:15:03.102 --> 00:15:05.871
THAT EMPLOYEES AT A REHIRE OR

00:15:05.938 --> 00:15:08.073
THOSE WHO ARE VACCINATED. HOW

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.776
DOES THAT JIVE WITH. THE

00:15:10.843 --> 00:15:15.180
SENIORITY POLICY LIKE THIS.

REQUIREMENT OR PREFERENCE

00:15:21.553 --> 00:15:24.890
REGARDING VACCINATIONS AND- IT

00:15:24.957 --> 00:15:28.360
IS NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT EVEN IF

00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:29.828
THIS WERE ADDRESS THAT THAT

00:15:29.895 --> 00:15:32.865
WOULD BE LEGALLY IF WE WOULD BE

00:15:32.931 --> 00:15:37.102
LEGALLY ABLE TO DO SO- AND I

00:15:37.169 --> 00:15:40.406
WILL DEFINITELY. GET STAFF TO

00:15:40.472 --> 00:15:41.407
LOOK INTO THE LEGAL

00:15:41.473 --> 00:15:42.975
IMPLICATIONS OF THAT WHICH I

00:15:43.042 --> 00:15:45.177
CANNOT SPEAK TO AS I STAND HERE

00:15:45.244 --> 00:15:46.945

CALIFORNIA THE ADMINISTRATION

00:16:09.268 --> 00:16:11.003
IN FACT IN DEALING WITH THE

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:13.372
CULVERT SITUATION AND THE

00:16:13.439 --> 00:16:16.942
DEVASTATION TO SMALL BUSINESSES.

00:16:17.009 --> 00:16:17.509
A CAREER IN THE HOSPITALITY

00:16:17.576 --> 00:16:19.378
INDUSTRY. THAT WAS CONCERTED

00:16:19.445 --> 00:16:21.847
EFFORT. IT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE

00:16:21.914 --> 00:16:23.482
BETTER BY THIS ADMINISTRATION

00:16:28.087 --> 00:16:30.089
LIKE MAKING A HOLE ALL OF THOSE

00:16:30.155 --> 00:16:31.423

ACTIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND

00:16:33.792 --> 00:16:36.261
THE GOVERNOR. AND I DON'T THINK

00:16:36.328 --> 00:16:37.496

SO THIS BILL DOESN'T TALK ABOUT

00:17:25.177 --> 00:17:26.945

00:18:25.404 --> 00:18:27.439
CONCERN TO BUSINESS. AS TO THE

00:18:27.506 --> 00:18:28.907
SPECIFIC QUESTION IS THE

00:18:28.974 --> 00:18:31.977
VACCINES. THE EMPLOYERS RUN THE

00:18:32.044 --> 00:18:34.680
RECALL LIST BUT THE VACCINE

00:18:34.746 --> 00:18:36.715
ISSUE IS A SEPARATE ISSUE AND

00:18:36.782 --> 00:18:37.282
IF AN EMPLOYEE OF A PRIVATE

00:18:37.349 --> 00:18:39.885
EMPLOYER. UNDER APPROPRIATE

00:18:39.952 --> 00:18:41.653
CIRCUMSTANCES WANTS TO IMPOSE A

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:44.523
MANDATORY VACCINE RULE FOR ITS

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:47.893
WORKFORCE. SHAMING THE LAW

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.628
CONTINUES TO PERMIT THAT THE

00:18:49.695 --> 00:18:51.530
EMPLOYER IMPOSES A MATTER

00:18:51.597 --> 00:18:53.098
MANDATORY VACCINE REQUIREMENTS

00:18:53.165 --> 00:18:56.668
EMPLOYEES WHO ACCEPTED RECALL.

00:18:56.735 --> 00:18:58.470
MAY OR MAY NOT MEET THAT TEST.

00:18:58.537 --> 00:19:00.405
AND THEN THEY DROP OUT IN THE

00:19:00.472 --> 00:19:02.708
EMPLOYER FILLS A POSITION SO

00:19:02.774 --> 00:19:04.776
THAT'S HOW. BASED ON MY

00:19:04.843 --> 00:19:07.312
EXPERIENCE THE VACCINE ISSUE

00:19:07.379 --> 00:19:08.814
AND THE MANDATORY IMPOSITION OF

00:19:08.881 --> 00:19:11.450
A VACCINE RULE. INTERSECTS WITH

00:19:14.753 --> 00:19:15.888
