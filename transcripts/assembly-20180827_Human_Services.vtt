00:28:54.066 --> 00:28:58.270 region:rollup2
A LOT OF BUT UPSET THERE AND A

00:28:56.768 --> 00:29:00.105 region:rollup2
BAD NOW AUDIT AND BAD OUTCOMES

00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:02.074 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S AND THAT DEPARTMENTS

00:29:00.105 --> 00:29:02.641 region:rollup2
ATTEMPTED TO ADDRESS THAT.

00:29:02.074 --> 00:29:03.875 region:rollup2
BUT PART OF THEIR ATTEMPT TO

00:29:02.641 --> 00:29:06.812 region:rollup2
ADDRESS IT.

00:29:03.875 --> 00:29:07.479 region:rollup2
WAS TO BRING IN SOMEONE WHO RAN

00:29:06.812 --> 00:29:09.014 region:rollup2
IN.

00:29:07.479 --> 00:29:11.550 region:rollup2
CENTRAL VALLEY REGIONAL CENTER.

00:29:09.014 --> 00:29:13.552 region:rollup2
WHO WAS ANTI UNION TO TRY AND

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:14.920 region:rollup2
TALK TO THE UNION ABOUT LOWER

00:29:13.552 --> 00:29:16.288 region:rollup2
AND LOWER AND THEIR WAGES AND

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:17.756 region:rollup2
THEY AGREED THAT THEY HAVE

00:29:16.288 --> 00:29:18.857 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DID THAT BUT THAT

00:29:17.756 --> 00:29:20.392 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE TIME WAS

00:29:18.857 --> 00:29:22.694 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO CLOSE?

00:29:20.392 --> 00:29:24.630 region:rollup2
THE NONPROFIT KERN AND HAND

00:29:22.694 --> 00:29:26.098 region:rollup2
CONTROL OVER THAT. TO THE

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:27.165 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT REGIONAL CENTER.

00:29:26.098 --> 00:29:29.167 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE TWO DIFFERENT

00:29:27.165 --> 00:29:31.570 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS AND THREATENING PEOPLE

00:29:29.167 --> 00:29:34.139 region:rollup2
LIKE THAT CAUSED HUGE UPSET BOTH

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:35.374 region:rollup2
IN THE CLIENTS AND IN THE STAFF

00:29:34.139 --> 00:29:36.675 region:rollup2

00:29:35.374 --> 00:29:38.176 region:rollup2
BEGIN TO OCCUR.

00:29:36.675 --> 00:29:39.444 region:rollup2
SO WE THOUGHT THAT WAS THE WRONG

00:29:38.176 --> 00:29:41.346 region:rollup2
WAY TO GO.

00:29:39.444 --> 00:29:42.547 region:rollup2
AND THE WAY TO DEAL WITH THESE

00:29:41.346 --> 00:29:43.715 region:rollup2
THINGS IN A RATIONAL AND SANE

00:29:42.547 --> 00:29:45.984 region:rollup2
MANNER AND OPEN TRANSPARENT

00:29:43.715 --> 00:29:48.320 region:rollup2
MANNER AND SO THE BILL ATTEMPTS

00:29:45.984 --> 00:29:50.422 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT.

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.722 region:rollup2
AND THANK I'M SORRY THAT

00:29:50.422 --> 00:29:52.758 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:29:50.722 --> 00:29:53.925 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY.

00:29:52.758 --> 00:29:54.526 region:rollup2
THAT I WAS GOING TO SAY IS I

00:29:53.925 --> 00:29:54.826 region:rollup2
PRETTY MUCH THINK THING IT'S

00:29:54.526 --> 00:29:56.328 region:rollup2
TROUBLED --

00:29:54.826 --> 00:29:57.529 region:rollup2
PASTURE WITH THIS REGIONAL

00:29:56.328 --> 00:29:58.930 region:rollup2
CENTER THE STATE ACTUALLY CAME

00:29:57.529 --> 00:29:59.831 region:rollup2
AND TRIED TO FIX THAT.

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:02.234 region:rollup2
AYE THEY BROUGHT IN ANOTHER

00:29:59.831 --> 00:30:03.602 region:rollup2
AGENCY TO HELP ASSIST WITH THAT.

00:30:02.234 --> 00:30:05.504 region:rollup2
THIS LEGISLATION HERE IS TRYING

00:30:03.602 --> 00:30:06.772 region:rollup2
TO SEEK ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY

00:30:05.504 --> 00:30:09.508 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE TAXPAYER

00:30:06.772 --> 00:30:10.409 region:rollup2
FUNDS ARE BEING USED. TO HELP

00:30:09.508 --> 00:30:12.711 region:rollup2
FIND ALL OF THE DEVELOPMENT

00:30:10.409 --> 00:30:13.011 region:rollup2

00:30:13.011 --> 00:30:17.783 region:rollup2
AND AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS

00:30:16.014 --> 00:30:19.685 region:rollup2
INCREASE AT TRANSPARENCY SO THAT

00:30:17.783 --> 00:30:20.652 region:rollup2
WE CAN HOPEFULLY BE THAT BRIDGE

00:30:19.685 --> 00:30:21.253 region:rollup2
AND THEY COLLABORATE COME

00:30:20.652 --> 00:30:22.487 region:rollup2
TOGETHER.

00:30:21.253 --> 00:30:23.855 region:rollup2
LIKE THE OPPOSITION SAID WHEN

00:30:22.487 --> 00:30:25.323 region:rollup2
PEOPLE COME TOGETHER I THINK

00:30:23.855 --> 00:30:26.591 region:rollup2
GREAT OUTCOMES HAPPEN.

00:30:25.323 --> 00:30:27.793 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU HAVE THAT TRANSPARENCY

00:30:26.591 --> 00:30:29.294 region:rollup2
THAT TRUST ABOUT HOW THE

00:30:27.793 --> 00:30:31.763 region:rollup2

THEY SEE THIS LEGISLATION AS A

00:30:35.567 --> 00:30:39.171 region:rollup2
PATH TOWARDS THOSE ARE ALSO BUT

00:30:37.436 --> 00:30:40.772 region:rollup2

AT A COMPLIANCE.

00:32:06.558 --> 00:32:10.061 region:rollup2
THAT WE PAY FINES TO I THINK TO

00:32:08.693 --> 00:32:11.062 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PIECE OF

00:32:10.061 --> 00:32:13.565 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR THAT

00:32:11.062 --> 00:32:14.599 region:rollup2
WE ACTUALLY DON'T PAY FEES TO

00:32:13.565 --> 00:32:15.934 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR ANY

00:32:14.599 --> 00:32:18.236 region:rollup2
SORT OF FINES --

00:32:15.934 --> 00:32:19.237 region:rollup2
THAT WE RUN THE RISK ALWAYS OF

00:32:18.236 --> 00:32:21.840 region:rollup2
ANY TIME YOU'RE OUT OF

00:32:19.237 --> 00:32:23.508 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE WITH ANY FEDERAL

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:25.544 region:rollup2
EXPECTATIONS OF IN THE FEDERAL

00:32:23.508 --> 00:32:26.578 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT TAKING NOTICE OF THAT

00:32:25.544 --> 00:32:28.280 region:rollup2
AND COMING IN AND TAKING

00:32:26.578 --> 00:32:29.614 region:rollup2
CORRECTIVE ACTION.

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:30.248 region:rollup2
THAT HAPPENED LAST IN THE

00:32:29.614 --> 00:32:31.716 region:rollup2
NINETEEN IN THE LATE NINETEEN

00:32:30.248 --> 00:32:34.686 region:rollup2
NINETIES AS I'M SURE YOU'RE

00:32:31.716 --> 00:32:35.253 region:rollup2
AWARE -- AND

00:32:34.686 --> 00:32:38.757 region:rollup2
AWARE THAT MORNING BUT THAT

00:32:35.253 --> 00:32:39.057 region:rollup2
STILL AND THAT HURTS MY HEART

00:32:38.757 --> 00:32:42.160 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:32:39.057 --> 00:32:43.261 region:rollup2
I WAS.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.396 region:rollup2
A LOT OF YEARS.

00:32:43.261 --> 00:32:44.996 region:rollup2
OF WAR THOUGH --

00:32:44.396 --> 00:32:46.064 region:rollup2
IN THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES

00:32:44.996 --> 00:32:47.933 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID COME

00:32:46.064 --> 00:32:49.434 region:rollup2
IN AND IT COST THE STATE ABOUT A

00:32:47.933 --> 00:32:50.735 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE COURSE

00:32:49.434 --> 00:32:53.538 region:rollup2
OF FIVE YEARS.

00:32:50.735 --> 00:32:55.073 region:rollup2
WE'RE CURRENTLY ABOUT SIX

00:32:53.538 --> 00:32:56.541 region:rollup2
HUNDRED SERVICE COORDINATOR

00:32:55.073 --> 00:32:58.243 region:rollup2
SHORT -- I

00:32:56.541 --> 00:33:00.145 region:rollup2
THINK SLIGHTLY LESS THAN THAT

00:32:58.243 --> 00:33:02.247 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THAT

00:33:00.145 --> 00:33:03.915 region:rollup2
IS THAT OUR SYSTEM CONTINUES TO

00:33:02.247 --> 00:33:05.116 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE TREMENDOUS GROWTH IN

00:33:03.915 --> 00:33:06.651 region:rollup2
CASELOAD.

00:33:05.116 --> 00:33:08.386 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE

00:33:06.651 --> 00:33:09.821 region:rollup2
HAVE IS THAT FOR EACH CASE

00:33:08.386 --> 00:33:11.790 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT POSITION THAT'S

00:33:09.821 --> 00:33:13.391 region:rollup2
FUNDED.

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:14.926 region:rollup2
THERE IT'S BUDGETED --

00:33:13.391 --> 00:33:17.295 region:rollup2
THERE'S ONLY SUFFICIENT FUNDING

00:33:14.926 --> 00:33:19.130 region:rollup2
FOR ABOUT 60% OF A POSITION SO

00:33:17.295 --> 00:33:20.665 region:rollup2
AS THE STATE CONTINUES TO GROW

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:22.701 region:rollup2
IN IS THE CASELOAD --

00:33:20.665 --> 00:33:23.335 region:rollup2
OVERALL CASELOAD OF THE STATE

00:33:22.701 --> 00:33:24.936 region:rollup2
CONTINUES TO GROW IN THE SYSTEM

00:33:23.335 --> 00:33:27.505 region:rollup2
--

00:33:24.936 --> 00:33:28.073 region:rollup2
WE SAW SOME INITIAL REALLY FROM

00:33:27.505 --> 00:33:29.307 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN

00:33:28.073 --> 00:33:31.576 region:rollup2
THAT -- IN

00:33:29.307 --> 00:33:32.477 region:rollup2
THAT YEAR AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING

00:33:31.576 --> 00:33:34.179 region:rollup2
IS THAT --

00:33:32.477 --> 00:33:35.614 region:rollup2
NEW.

00:33:34.179 --> 00:33:37.215 region:rollup2
EXPECTATIONS FOR NEW POSITIONS

00:33:35.614 --> 00:33:38.683 region:rollup2
ARE PUTTING ADDITIONAL STRESS ON

00:33:37.215 --> 00:33:39.918 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM I I UNDERSTAND THAT

00:33:38.683 --> 00:33:41.119 region:rollup2
YOU'RE SAYING THAT.

00:33:39.918 --> 00:33:41.786 region:rollup2
ANYTHING THAT'S THE FUNDED IS

00:33:41.119 --> 00:33:43.288 region:rollup2
SORT OF THE STATE'S

00:33:41.786 --> 00:33:44.723 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY IF YOU'RE ONLY

00:33:43.288 --> 00:33:45.557 region:rollup2
GETTING 60% OF WHAT YOU NEED.

00:33:44.723 --> 00:33:47.058 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE STATE'S

00:33:45.557 --> 00:33:48.226 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY I AGREE WITH THAT

00:33:47.058 --> 00:33:50.629 region:rollup2
I GUESS I WOULD JUST ASK THAT IF

00:33:48.226 --> 00:33:52.197 region:rollup2
THERE IS A PLAN. FOR HOW TO GET

00:33:50.629 --> 00:33:54.566 region:rollup2
THE STATE --

00:33:52.197 --> 00:33:56.034 region:rollup2
TO CLOSE TO A 100% OF COMPLIANCE

00:33:54.566 --> 00:33:57.102 region:rollup2
WE DON'T FIND OURSELVES.

00:33:56.034 --> 00:33:58.336 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY HAPPEN TO PAY

00:33:57.102 --> 00:34:00.105 region:rollup2
