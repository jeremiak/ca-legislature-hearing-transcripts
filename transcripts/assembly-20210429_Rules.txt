A MENTALITY THAT CARRIED FORWARD TO THE STATE'S EARLIEST LEADERS WITH THE FIRST GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SETTING OUT PAID BOUNTIES TO FORMALISMS AND AIDED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHO EMBARKED ON A DELIBERATE POLICY OF GENOCIDE AS DEFINED.

ONE WHERE CALIFORNIA'S ELECTED OFFICIALS TAKE ACTION TO CORRECT THE WRONGS OF THE PAST. AND TO RECOGNIZE THE IMMENSE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICANS HAVE MADE TO THIS GREAT STATE.

KEVIN COLLEY AT MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE COULD YOU COULD LOOK UP THE JOKES AS MUCH AS A POKER I KNOW YEAH SET THESE TWO TRIANGLE I AM THE TERMINAL WILL RANCHERIA I'M HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY AND HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ASSEMBLY MEMBER JAMES RAMOS AND THE FIVE SPONSORING TRIBES. I'M ALSO HONORED TO TESTIFY TODAY IN STRONG. SUPPORT IS VERY IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. MY AND DID CHAIRED PAPA THE AND SECTOR COUNTY REGION. MY ANCESTORS INHABITED THE LAND THAT WORK LOCATED ALONG THE PATH THE MASSIVE DEATH AND DESTRUCTION OF CALIFORNIA INDIANS. CALLED BY THE SPANISH MISSIONARY SYSTEM. THE MEXICAN AND AMERICAN MILITARY INCURSIONS DISEASE THE BRUTALITY AND TORTURE THAT RESULTS FROM SLAVERY AS WELL TO BUY THE COMPANY MY TO GET SETTLED. THEY SIT HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY WANT TO BE CLEAR IT'S ABOUT MORE THAN ONE ABOUT A SET OF. AS IMPORTANT AS IT IS AB THREE THIRTY EIGHT IS JUST ONE STEP TOWARDS DOING THE RIGHT THING FOR THE INDIGENOUS ME WALK AND LISTEN I'M PEOPLE OF THE SACRAMENTO REGION. BUT ABOUT US THERE WAS NOT A GOOD MAN. ALTHOUGH THE INTENTIONS WERE DEBATED WE GOOD THE MEANS BY WHICH YOU PURSUED HIS GOAL OF SAVING INDIGENOUS PEOPLE ELIMINATE ALL ARGUMENTS THAT HE WAS A GOOD MAN. SOME MAY ARGUE THAT ONE OF BETTER SERVICE WORKERS GOT SENT. FOR MY PEOPLE WHO LIFTED THE ENSLAVEMENT AND THE BRUTAL ATROCITIES OF THIS MAN. OUR VIEW IS QUITE THE CONTRARY AND INDISPUTABLE. GOOD MEN DO NOT AUTHORIZE THE BRUTALIZATION OF MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN AN ATTEMPT TO PURIFY THEIR BODIES OF STAN AND THEIR WAY OF LIFE. GOOD MEN DO NOT BUILD THE SYSTEM BY WHICH INDIGENOUS PEOPLE WERE RIPPED AWAY FROM THEIR HOMES AND FORCED INTO A HARSH LABOR FOR A REASON THAT SAW THE MESS OF HUMAN. TRUTH BE TOLD THE ENTIRE NARRATIVE ABOUT ONE ABOUT A SERAPH AND IS WORKING AS A PUBLIC INSTRUMENT. IS ABOUT A MUCH LARGER SYSTEM OF OPPRESSION THAT STOP TO DECIMATE CALIFORNIA'S INDIGENOUS PEOPLE. THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS SYSTEM IS WITHOUT A DOUBT A CHAPTER IN THE STATE'S HISTORY THAT NEEDS TELLING. THOSE WISHING TO REMOVE SERRA'S NAME AND LIKE THIS FROM PUBLIC I DO NOT WISH TO RE WRITE HISTORY OR UNDO WHAT WAS DONE IN THE PAST. INSTEAD THOSE SUCH AS MYSELF AND MY PEOPLE SEE YOU SEE WHAT ABOUT A SERRA AS A SYMBOL OF UNTRUTHFUL HISTORY. THAT THEY'RE PERPETUATED FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL MANY STUDENTS ARE TAUGHT ABOUT THE MISSION SYSTEM AND ITS BENEVOLENCE TOWARDS INDIGENOUS PEOPLE. THESE WEAPONS INCLUDING NARRATIVE THAT NATIVE PEOPLE WERE SAVED BY THE MISSIONS AND THAT THE RESIDENTS THERE WAS BY CHOICE. THESE LESSONS ALMOST ALTOGETHER DENIED THE INJUSTICES. VIOLENCE ON THE GENOCIDE THAT HEARD AS PART OF THE CAL. MISSION JUST. AS WE TO BUILD A MORE JUST AND EQUITABLE FOR CAL READ WE MY TELL NOW HIS WARNINGS FOR. WHY SHOULD WE IGNORE THE BY IN THE OF THE IMAGE SYSTEM AND FAVOR OF A ROSE COLORED HISTORY THAT FAVORS THE CAR CAL IN TO. REMOVE ONE OF PREDECESSOR ELEVATES IS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF TELLING A STORY THAT IS INCLUSIVE OF ALL VOICES IN CALIFORNIA. THANK JUST A MOMENT HOW MANY ICONS OF THE PAST CAN YOU NAME OFF THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD. WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THE COLONIZATION OF CALIFORNIA BY MEANS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST INDIGENOUS PEOPLE. JOHN SUTTER. ONE OF BETTER SIR. GET CARDINAL COME TO MIND AS THEY HAVE BEEN GRANTED A STATUS OF HISTORICAL FIGURE DUE TO THEIR PROMINENCE AND FOUNDING OF CALIFORNIA. YOU DO NOT THINK OF THE MEANS BY WHICH THEY PRODUCE THE RESULTS. ONLY THE MEN THEMSELVES. NOW TRY TO TAKE THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME AND THINK OF CALIFORNIA'S INDIGENOUS PEOPLE MY ANCESTORS AMONG THEM. WELL RESPONSIBLE FOR DEFENDING VARIOUS TRIBAL CULTURES AND TRADITIONS. DO ANY COME TO MIND. NOT THAT EVEN IF THE- R. DAR UNLESS YOU'RE CALIFORNIA HISTORIAN YOU'LL STRUGGLE TO NAME ANY INDIGENOUS PEOPLE BETTER DO THE SIMPLE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE OPPRESSORS HAVE COME TO WRITE THE NARRATIVE OF THE OPPRESSED. ASSEMBLY MEMBER JAMES ROSS IS AB THREE THIRTY EIGHT TAKE THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS TELLING ENACTED HISTORY ON THE PART OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLE BY REMOVING ONE OF BETTER SERVICE STATUTE IT REMOVES A CONSTANT REMINDER OF THE VIOLENCE PERPETUATED AGAINST PEOPLE INDIGENOUS TO THE STATE MY PEOPLE. INSTEAD OF BEING REMINDED THAT THEIR ANCESTORS WERE VICTIMS OF THE VIOLENCE SYSTEM THAT SOUGHT TO STRIP THEM OF THEIR IDENTITY AND CULTURE WE CAN'T BEGIN TO TELL A NARRATIVE OF RESILIENCE IN THE FACE OF ADVERSITY AND THAT'S IRONY THAT WILL ALLOW FOR NATIVE PEOPLE PARTICULARLY ARE YOU. TO FILL OUT THEIR IDENTITY AND WHAT TO THE BALLOT% IN TODAY'S SOCIETY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR A BI. THREE THIRTY EIGHT. UNCLE MORE. THANK YOU FOR CHAIRMAN I WANT TO KNOW THAT WE- INFO OF US THE PICTURE OF YOSEMITE VALLEY. WHERE CHIEF TEN IDEA. WAS CHASED INTO THE MOUNTAINS. BUT AS A PART OF THE US ARMY. IN THIS ERA.

THESE COMMUNITIES AND THE MANY TRIBAL COMMUNITIES WITHIN CALIFORNIA HAVE REMAINED COMMITTED TO THE STEWARDSHIP OF THE PLANET SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO.

MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS KEVIN SNYDER PACIFIC JUSTICE INSTITUTE'S CENTER FOR PUBLIC POLICY WHERE I SERVED AS CHIEF COUNSEL. THIS MORNING I SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO AB THREE THREE EIGHT UNLESS AMENDED. THE BILL HAS TWO PRIMARY PARTS IN ONE PART IT PROPOSES TO ERECT A MONUMENT TO CALIFORNIA NATIVE PEOPLE OF THE SACRAMENTO REGION. THERE IS A PERSON OR PERSONS OF HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE. THROUGH VIRTUE OR VALOR ARE DESERVING OF RECOGNITION WE DO NOT OPPOSE THE STATUTE. WHO DIRECTED IN THERE ON. WHAT WE DO OPPOSE IS A STRIKING OF THE LAWCENTER REX AND MAINTAINS A MONUMENT TO WHOM THE PARENTS ARE UP THE APOSTLE OF CALIFORNIA ON THE CAPITOL GROUNDS. THIS DISDAIN TOWARDS THINGS HAVING TO DO WITH CATHOLICISM IS NOT NEW IN CALIFORNIA. IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE THE ANTI CATHOLIC BLAINE AMENDMENT WAS ADDED TO THE STATE CONSTITUTION. THE U. S. SUPREME COURT. RECENTLY EXPLAINED THAT BLAINE AMENDMENTS WERE ADDED TO STATE CONSTITUTIONS. STILL THE- THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND TO CATHOLICS IN GENERAL. SADLY OF THE GHOST OF ANTI CATHOLIC CONTEMPT STILL HAUNTS THE CAPITOL DOME. CURRENTLY FOR BILLS THAT TAKE AIM AT CATHOLICS IN THEIR INSTITUTIONS ARE WORKING THEIR WAY THROUGH COMMITTEES AS WE SPEAK. THE ANTIPATHY TOWARDS THE FAITHFUL WAS MOST CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED ON A SUMMER EVENING LAST JULY FOR IN A NIGHT OF TERROR I'M GROUP OF MILITANT MARXIST MARCHED ON THE GROUNDS OF THE CAPITOL IN VIOLENTLY TOWARD DOWN THE STATUE. OF FATHER SERRA WHO WAS HOLDING ACROSS. CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICERS STOOD BY PASSIVELY. MOB PROCEEDED TO STOP IT WITH THEIR FEET. IMAGERY OF THAT BAND OF THAT EVENT. IT APPROPRIATE BECAUSE MARXISTS HAVE NOTHING REDEMPTIVE TO OFFER THE WORLD THEY STAND. AS THE RELIGION OF YOUR RELIGION BE ASSURED THAT THEY ARE NOT CONTENT TO LET THEIR RAGE ON OBJECT INANIMATE. IT WILL NOT BE LONG BEFORE THEY WILL TURN THEIR TAX ON FLESH AND BLOOD. THE HISTORICAL RECORD IS CLEAR IN ALL PLACES AND AT ALL TIMES WERE MARXIST. CORRECT OUR JOURNALISM IS A POWER OF THE BILL MR STEINER. MISTER CHAIRMAN I SHALL. BUT I WOULD LIKE LIKE TO RESPOND.

THE PLANES IN INDIA CALIFORNIA THIS ISN'T ABOUT RE RACING HISTORY THIS IS NOT ABOUT CANCEL CULTURE SAYS VERY SPECIFICALLY. DESIGNED TO RIP OFF ALL THE HIDDEN GARBAGE ABOUT OUR HISTORY. REVEAL THE TRUTH. WHERE HUMANS OUR HISTORY IS NOT SUNSHINE AND RAINBOWS. THERE'S WARS THERE'S BLOOD THERE'S GENOCIDE THEIR SLAVERY THERE ARE CHOROS CITIES THAT MANY OF US IN OUR SUNSHINE AND RAINBOW BUBBLES. ARE TOO SENSITIVE TO EVEN WANT TO TALK ABOUT AND THAT IS THE POINT OF THIS. FIFTY SHADES THIS IS ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENED HERE. WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT WHETHER YOU FEEL THAT IT MIGHT. TARNISH A PAST PRESTIGIOUS REPUTATION. THE FACTS ARE THE FACTS THE HISTORY IS THE HISTORY. AND THAT IS WHY I'M HONORED AND HUMBLED. TO PUSH THIS LEGISLATION FOR WITH MY COLLEAGUES MEMBERS I ASK YOU FOR YOUR AYE VOTES AGAIN. BEFORE PROCEDURAL I JUST WANT TO SEND I THANK YOU. MR RAMA FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- CALIFORNIA WE OFTEN THINK OF OURSELVES IN THE VANGUARD BUT TWO YEARS AGO I TRAVELED TO THE MINNESOTA STATE CAPITOL WHERE THEY ACTUALLY HAVE SUBSTANTIAL SPACE IN THEIR CAPITAL DEDICATED TO THE SUBJECT MATTER THE TREATIES MATTER YOU ACTUALLY FIND ONLINE- THAT HEADING TREATIES MATTER. AND AS A KNOWLEDGE MUCH OF A- BAD HISTORY. WITH THE MINNESOTA NATIVE PEOPLES AND THERE'S STATE CAPITOL. AND I THINK OUR- I PROTECTING APPRECIATE THE WITNESS THE MOTHERS OF INDIGENOUS BABIES I THINK WHAT WE KNOW IS HERE IN THE CAPITAL REGION WHICH IS THE PEOPLES THAT WE WILL HONOR BY THIS MONUMENT. WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT LIVED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. SUCCESSFULLY IN A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THE WORLD IN WHICH THEY LIVE I TAKE DOES THAT BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE WHICH IS INDUCED BY. OUR ACTIVITIES. THEY LIVED IN BALANCE WITH THEIR- ENVIRONMENT AND THEY WANT THE SAME THING FOR THEIR CHILDREN THE WAY OF WELL BEING UPBRINGING HOPE FOR THE FUTURE STABILITY IN THEIR LIVES THESE ARE THE SAME THINGS THAT WE ASPIRE TO IS LAWMAKERS TO UNDERTAKE ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. SO I THINK THIS IS ACTUALLY A POWERFUL REMINDER. THAT AS MR MATHESON SAID WE ARE PEOPLE. WE HAVE THE GOOD AND THE BAD. I THINK HERE IN SACRAMENTO THERE IS A LONG HISTORY OF PEOPLE DEVOTED TO THE WELL BEING OF THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR SUCCESSORS. AND WE ARE JUST THE LATEST EXPRESSION OF THAT IN THIS BUILDING. AND I ACTUALLY FEEL I TAKE SOME STRENGTH FROM THE HERITAGE TO DISMANTLE SALVAGE WHAT THAT- MISTER CORPORATE WILL TAKE THE ROLE.
