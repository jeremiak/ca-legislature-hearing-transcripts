BUT WHAT HASN'T CHANGED IS THAT CALIFORNIA START THE FOREFRONT OF THIS FIGHT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THE NATION'S MOST INNOVATIVE RESPONSES BY ALWAYS LISTENING TO SCIENCE. AND AS MORE INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE ADAPTING OUR PLANS. AFTER SUCCESSFULLY REOPENING THE CON ME UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PANDEMIC ROAD MAP AND BLUEPRINT FOR A SAFER ECONOMY THE SMARTER PLANT IS THE LATEST ADAPTATION OF CALIFORNIA'S RESPONSE PLANS. THE SMARTER PLAN WAS RELEASED IN FEBRUARY AS THE OMICRON VIRANT SEARCH ENDED AND GOVERNOR NEWSOM RESCINDED MOST OF COVER NINETEENTH EXACT OF ORDERS. THE SMARTER PLANT IS A NOBLE FIRST IN THE NATION SHIFT AS IT GUIDES CALIFORNIA'S EVOLVING RESPONSE WITH A FOCUS ON CONTINUE READING US AWARENESS. FLEXIBILITY AND EQUITY. ADDITIONALLY THIS IS THE FIRST PLAN DOESN'T AFTER BOTH COPA NINETEEN AND ALL FUTURE INFECTIOUS DISEASE EMERGENCIES. AS CALIFORNIA IS NOW SEEN ANOTHER RISING KOBE NINETEEN CASES THE SMARTER PLAN FACES ITS FIRST MAJOR TEST. I AM CONFIDENT CALIFORNIA ONCE AGAIN RISE TO THE OCCASION. IT IS IMPORTANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO VIE WITH THIS WATER PLANT FOR THE SAFETY OF THE ENTIRE STATE I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM OUR PANELISTS.

HOW THIS WATER PLANT IS RESPONDING TO THE RISING COVINA CASES AND HOW THE LEGISLATURE CAN SUPPORT THE SMART PLAN IN THE YEARS TO COME. I WITHOUT IS THERE ANY MEMBERS THAT WOULD LIKE TO MAKE AN COMMENTS FRAZIER. OKAY ALL RIGHT LET'S GO THERE FOR PANEL. AS REMARKABLE HOLD QUITE UNTIL THE END OF THE BROUGH OUR PRESENTATION. FIRST PANEL FIRST WE'LL HEAR FROM DR. MUNTU DAVIS COUNTY HEALTH OFFICER OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH- DOCTOR DAVIS ARE EITHER. G. WIRELESSLY. DR DAVIS. I'M HERE CAN YOU HEAR ME GO AHEAD YOU'RE READY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING TO EVERYONE- I'M DOCUMENTS YOU DAVIS THE L. A. COUNTY HEALTH OFFICER I WANT TO THANK YOU- COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN THREE GUESTS ON OUR WILL COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY ABOUT OUR EXPERIENCE IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTING THE SMARTER PLAN AND LA COUNTY'S CULVER NINETEEN RESPONSE- AS MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW L. A. COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH WORKS COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE STATE THROUGH VARIOUS- ARE. IMPORTANT FACETS OF OCTOBER NINETEEN RESPONSE. OKAY OF THE SMARTER. AND TODAY I'D LIKE TO SOME OF THE KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS WE REACHED THAT DIRECTLY ALIGNED WITH THE STATE'S SMARTER PLANT AND SOME OF THE FORESEEABLE CHALLENGES WE FACE GIVEN THE CONTINUED COVERED NINETEEN RESPONSE. TIME SO TO BEGIN AS OF MAY EIGHTH R. EIGHTEEN MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE THOUSAND AND SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX COVERED NINETEEN VACCINE DOSES HAVE BEEN ADMINISTERED IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. CURRENTLY 76% OF LA COUNTY'S ELIGIBLE POPULATION AGES FIVE YEARS AND OLDER IS FULLY VACCINATED ABOUT 40% OF THIS POPULATION HAS RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE ADDITIONAL DOSES WHILE. THESE RESULTS HAVE BEEN MADE POSSIBLE THROUGH A ROBUST NETWORK OF A VACCINE PROVIDERS- THE COUNTY ITSELF STOOD UP A ROBUST DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM FOR VACCINES AND THERAPEUTICS WITH SUPPORT FROM THE STATE AND THE SYSTEM INCORPORATED THAT SPECIALIZE HANDLING STORAGE AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT NEEDS OF THE VARIOUS VACCINE PRODUCTS AND FOCUSES ON COMMUNITIES DISPROPORTIONATELY. BURDENED BY OCTOBER NINETEEN. AS OF MAY SEVENTH- THERE ARE NEARLY TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTY VACCINATION SITES AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT LA COUNTY WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON MAKING VACCINES READILY AVAILABLE AND H. P. I. PLUS COMMUNITIES. WE ALSO HAVE BEEN WORKING TO DECREASE BARRIERS TO VACCINE VARIABILITY FOR RESIDENTS AND WORKERS ARE AND THAT'S BEEN KEY PRIORITY FOR US IN L. A. COUNTY. AND IT'S REQUIRED UTILIZING VARIOUS TYPES OF VACCINATION LOCATIONS INCLUDING FIXED SITES SCHOOL SITES AND MOBILE SITES. OF THE TWO THOUSAND THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER. ABOUT ONE THOUSAND AND TWO HUNDRED OF THOSE ARE FIXED SITES TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE OUR SCHOOL SITES AND FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO OUR MOBILE SITES. ARE WE CURRENTLY PARTNER WITH SIX- EXTERNAL MOBILE PROVIDERS TO REACH HOME BOUND RESIDENTS WHO ARE AT ELEVATED RISK OF SEVERE ILLNESS. I'M NOT ABLE TO TRAVEL TO THEIR SITE BETTER- TO A VACCINATION SITES- AND AS OF MARCH TWENTY TWENTY TWO THIS THIS YEAR. NEARLY TEN THOUSAND RESIDENTS CONSIDERED HOME BOUND OR VACCINATED. IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT- BE VACCINATED ALL FIFTY EIGHT CAMPAIGN. YOU KNOW WE HAVE COLLABORATED WITH THE TEAM AT THE STATE'S ROMOTE VACCINATION SITES AND BRING SUPPLEMENTAL SERVICES AND INCENTIVES TO VACCINATION SITES AND SOME OF OUR HARDEST HARDEST TO REACH COMMUNITIES. AND DESPITE THE WORK WITH THE STATE SET TO STAND UP SUPPORT AND PROMOTE THE VARIOUS VACCINATION SITES ATTENDED EFFORTS ARE STILL IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS THE DISPARITIES IN VACCINE UPTAKE. CURRENTLY ONLY 32% OF ELIGIBLE CHILDREN FIVE TO ELEVEN ARE FULLY VACCINATED SIGNALING THE NEED FOR ONGOING ACTIVITIES TO ADDRESS CONCERNS BY PARENTS STILL HAVE ABOUT VACCINE SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS. BUT WHEN LOOKING AT DATA BY RACE ETHNICITY- 74% OF WHITE RESIDENTS ARE FULLY VACCINATED ABOUT FIFTY ALMOST 60% OF THAT MATCH RESIDENTS ARE FULLY VACCINATED. SIX POINT THREE A BLACK AFRICAN AMERICAN RESIDENTS ARE FULLY VACCINATED- ARE CONCENTRATED ARE CONTRACTED A COMMUNITY WORKERS- HAVE LET US KNOW THAT THE RELAXING OF INFECTION CONTROL REQUIREMENTS MEANING MASKING OUR VACCINE VERIFICATION NEWS OF WANING VACCINE IMMUNITY AND INCREASED LIKELIHOOD OF INFECTION WITH NEW VARIANTS DESPITE BEING VACCINATED BOOSTED BY HAVE ALL DECREASED RESIDENTS PERCEPTION. THE NINETEEN AS A CONTINUOUS THREAT AND THAT VACCINATION AND OTHER INFECTION CONTROL MEASURES- REMAIN IMPORTANT- ADDITIONALLY I L. A. COUNTY MEDICAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH RESOURCES COORDINATED WITH THE STATE MEDICAL HELP OPERATIONAL AREA COORDINATION SYSTEM. TO DEPLOY A NATIONAL AND STATE GUARD- LOCALLY. TO STAFF SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND ISOLATION AND QUARANTINE OUR HOUSING SITES AND TO RECEIVE AND DISTRIBUTE- PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT COVER NINETEEN ENGINE FAST AND OTHER SUPPLIES. AND THESE ASSETS HAVE ALLOWED US TO SUPPORT SNAPS AND COLD JEAN MITIGATION TESTING AND VACCINATION AS WELL AS SUPPORTING PROVIDERS AND OTHER- RESPONDING ENTITIES. I WITH THE NEEDED SUPPLIES TO ENSURE THE PUBLIC HEALTH IS PROTECTED. HOW WE WORK AT THE STATE TO GET THE WORD OUT ABOUT ADDITIONAL FREE TEST KITS THAT CAN BE ORDERED. DIRECTLY FROM CITY PAGES WHILE. I'M AWARENESS READINESS- THIS PLAN OUR LOCAL- OF ENSURING THAT WE'RE MANAGING THE PANDEMIC WITH ALL THE TOOLS AND RESOURCES AT OUR DISPOSAL. AND AS A KEY PRINCIPLE- IN TERMS OF EQUITY NOT DATA THAT REFLECTS COMMUNITY INFORMATION. BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE AND SHOULD BE MADE READILY AVAILABLE AND EASILY- TIME EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND USE. ANTHROPIC PANDEMIC WE HAVE. A DATA ORGANIZED ORGANIZED IN DIFFERENT WAYS READILY AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC- AND PARTNERS. UNDERSTAFFED WARDS HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED AT THE HIGHLIGHT PROGRESS AND ONGOING EFFORTS. IN AREAS INCLUDING FROM THE NINETEEN OUTCOMES VACCINE ADMINISTRATION. I WOULD NINETEEN TESTING CONTACT TRACING OUTBREAKS OF BUSINESSES SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL NURSING FACILITIES. AND NOW OUR LOCAL EARLY ALERT INDICATORS. I'M L. A. COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH NOW HASN'T. DASHBOARD ON ITS WEBSITE- THAT INCLUDES A LIST OF METRICS BUT I SERVICE EARLY ALERT SIGNAL- FOR AFTER PARIS MEASURES. AND WE CONTINUALLY UPDATE THOSE- AS WE. SEE PROGRESS BEING MADE. I'M IF ANY OF KEY WIDER SECTORS IN THE TRIGGER I WILL BE CONCERN. WE CAN SET WAYS AND PROTECTOR STRATEGY- THE TOLL WE HAVE AN SINCE STEPS RESIDENTS AND WORKERS CAN TAKE. IN TO PROTECT HOMES AND OTHERS- IN ADDITION WE RECOMMEND ENSURING SUFFICIENT FUNDING FOR- GENETIC SEQUENCING. OF THOSE POSITIVE TEST THAT THAT ARE IDENTIFIED. IN THIS SUPPORTS OUR EFFORTS LOCALLY- ROUTINE SEQUENCING A POSITIVE SPECIMENS AS A KEY SURVEILLANCE METHODS. BY WHICH ALLOWS US TO IDENTIFY VARIANTS AND LINEAGES THAT MIGHT HAVE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH AND ECONOMIC. I WANT TO BE PROVIDE OUR- PROOF HEALTH TO OUR- SINCE THE SPREADABLE NINETEEN IS NOT SIMPLY. TO ONE GEOGRAPHIC AREA AS INDIVIDUALS COULD POTENTIALLY TRAVEL BETWEEN AREAS WITH HIGHER COVER NINETEEN TRANSMISSIONS AREAS OF LOWER TRANSMISSION AND VICE VERSA. I WILL ENSURE THAT WE ALL CAN MAINTAIN OUR SURVEILLANCE CAPACITY ACROSS THE STATE. BUDGET CREATES THAT AWARENESS THAT WE ALL NEED IN ORDER TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY- IN TERMS OF THERAPEUTICS. CONTESTED STREET. SOME OF THE VACCINATION EFFORTS- OUR COLLABORATION WITH THE STATE HAS ESTABLISHED A VAST NETWORK OF MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED PROVIDERS AND PHARMACIES THROUGHOUT LA COUNTY. THAT ARE PRESCRIBING OR DISPENSING THERAPEUTICS. AND WE'VE BEEN ENCOURAGING THE PUBLIC TO CONTACT THEIR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER TO SEE IF THEY CAN PROVIDE THE MEDICATIONS OR PRESCRIPTION IF THEY HAVE. MILD RAMADA ILLNESS. COMMITMENTS SYMPTOMS I'M WE'VE ALSO BEEN PROMOTING THE USE OF THE PROGRAM SAME DAY TESTING AND THREE THERAPEUTIC NOT SELECT PHARMACIES COUNTY WIDE- AND IF YOU'VE ALREADY BEEN TESTED YOU CAN ALSO BRING YOUR POSITIVE TEST OF THE SITE TO RECEIVE THE MEDICATION. IF THE ONSITE PROVIDER RECOMMENDS AND PRESCRIBES IT- AND FINALLY WE'VE BEEN PROMOTING FREE COGINT NINETEEN MEDICATION TELEHEALTH SERVICES. TO HELP RESIDENTS DETERMINE WHETHER THEY MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR FREE COVER NINETEEN THERAPEUTICS. AND CONNECT THEM WITH THE RESOURCES FOR GETTING TESTED DIAGNOSED AND A PRESCRIBE THE APPROPRIATE MEDICINES. ARE IN OUR PUBLIC HEALTH TELEHEALTH PROVIDERS ARE AVAILABLE SEVEN DAYS A WEEK TO SCREEN PATIENTS FOR ELIGIBILITY. AND INDEPENDENT ANYWAY- SPEAK ARAMBULA BIT MORE ABOUT THE EDUCATION- IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY SCHOOLS BEGAN RE OPENING IN PERSON SERVICES. AND COUNTY AND USING COUNTY AND STATE- GUIDANCE- AND MOST ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS HAVE REOPENED FOR IN PERSON LEARNING TWENTY ONE- AND IN PREPARATION PUBLIC HEALTH HOSTED REGULAR MEETINGS WITH SUPERINTENDENTS LABOR UNIONS AND PARENTS TO DEVELOP. ANY SAFETY MATTERS ARE CORPORATE SAFETY MEASURES AND ADDRESS CONCERNS THAT THEY MAY HAVE. UPDATING OUR GUIDANCE TO REFLECT THE CHANGING CONDITIONS AS WELL. WE'VE ALSO ESTABLISHED- WHAT'S NOTED AS A SCOOL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TEAM OUR STAFF TEAM. REASSIGNING SEVENTY STAFFERS AND SCHOOLS NEWLY RE OPENED- AND FOR ONGOING OPERATIONS TO ENSURE SAFETY MEASURES ARE BEING FOLLOWED AND UNDERSTOOD. I AM OUT OF THE OVER A THREE THOUSAND SCHOOLS IN L. A. COUNTY BY JUNE TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE TEAM THAT COMPLETED A TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDREDAND SIXTY SCHOOL SITE VISITS- WE ALSO ESTABLISHED- AND EXPOSURE AND OPERATE MANAGEMENT TEAM- THAT WORK WITH SCHOOLS. TO STOP IN SCHOOL TRANSMISSION WHEN CASES AND OUTBREAKS WERE IDENTIFIED AND QUICKLY THEREAFTER. OUTBREAKS. WERE LIMITED TO A FEW THOUSAND. I'M I THINK- ARE IN CLOSE- WE APPRECIATE THE BEEN. AND LEGISLATURE STRONG COMMITMENT TO SUPPORT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WITH ONGOING COMMITMENT OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR PUBLIC HALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. AND A CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP ARE FOR OCTOBER NINETEEN RESPONSE. NOW THIS LEVEL LONGER RESPONSE CANNOT BE SUSTAINED A LOAN ON LOCAL RESOURCES. AND IT WILL BE CRUCIAL OR CRITICAL BACK FROM LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. HAVE THE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT FOR OUR CURRENT AND POST EMERGENCY COVERED NINETEEN. OUR RESPONSE AND RECOVERY ACTIVITIES WELL FOR EXAMPLE VACCINATION TESTING AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH. CONDUCTED BY TRUSTED PARTNERS. I AND OTHER CORE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES- AND OUR COMMUNITY SERVICE SUPPORT AS WELL. WE THANK OUR STATE PARTNERS FOR THEIR CONTINUED SUPPORT AND COLLABORATION AND GREATLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE A LOCAL PERSPECTIVE. AND EXPERIENCE WITH EACH OF YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU A DOG DAVIS ANNETTE AND HEAR FROM DANIEL BOWERS DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF EMERGING MANAGEMENT THE CITY SACRAMENTO. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME TODAY'S A GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN AND MEET- MEET THE OTHERS SO I REALLY APPRECIATE. THAT JENSEN NEED TO PRESENT WHAT THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO DOING ONGOING IN IN DURING WE'RE HOLDING NEIGHBORHOOD VACCINE CLINICS- THE PELL CENTER- DOWN SOUTH SACRAMENTO JUST USES A QUICK EXAMPLE WE'RE BRINGING IN NEARLY A DOZEN INTERPRETERS. AND UTILIZING COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO GET THE WORD OUT THROUGH THOSE COMMUNITIES TO GET ACCESS TO A LOT OF OUR ELDERLY FOLKS WITH VULNERABLE UNDERLYING MEDICAL NATIONS WHO ARE MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE- TO THE VIRUS. I TO GET THEM AND INFORMED OF IT A LOT OF THE OLDER COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND SOME OF THOSE AREAS DO NOT SPEAK ENGLISH AND SO WE'RE MAKING SURE THAT WE WILL ROUTE THROUGH THOSE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS FOR BOTH- LINK. I THAT IS BEING ACTIVE SO FAR WE'VE HAD VERY GOOD TURN OUT OF THOSE IN THOSE ARE ONGOING. WE'VE BEEN HOLDING THOSE FOR- WELL OVER A YEAR NOW AND- WE'VE SEEN. PRETTY STEADY ATTENDANCE THAT'S PRETTY MUCH INGRAINED ACROSS THE CITY WE ALSO HAVE SOME OTHERS ROTATING SITES THAT WE PARTNER WITH SACRAMENTO COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH FOR AS WELL- IN IN FAIRLY GOOD TURN OUT- WE HAVE DEACTIVATED. OUR MOBILE VACCINE SITES THROUGH SACRAMENTO FIRE JUST GIVEN THAT THEIR- THE THAT DEMAND REALLY- FELL OFF. SO WITH THAT AND I ANTICIPATE AS ADDITIONAL BOOSTER SHOTS COME OUT WILL CONTINUE THOSE EFFORTS ACROSS THE- COMMUNITY. ONE THING I CAN SAY THAT- IT HAS BEEN VERY GOOD WE'VE SEEN AN UPTICK IN TRUST. COMMUNITY WITH. I THINK MORE COMMONSENSE COMMUNICATION TO ON THAT IF THEY ARE NOT EXPERIENCING SYMPTOMS OR JUST WATER SYMPTOMS TO STAY HOME. DON'T OVER ONE THE HOSPITALS I THINK WE'RE SEEING THOSE DIRECT EFFECTS ACROSS THE COUNTY BY NOT OVERWHELMING HOSPITALS AS WE IN DURING THIS MOST RECENT WAVE. IT SEEING THAT HOSPITALIZATIONS ARE STAYING VERY LOW AMOUNTED TO MONITOR THOSE VERY FREQUENTLY AND WE'RE NOT SEEING THE UPTICK THAT WE SAW DURING THE INITIAL OMICRON VERY COMING OUT. IT'S ALMOST AS A SLOW WAVE THAT WE'RE SEEING HERE I THINK A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH ADDITIONAL COMMUNICATION AND BUILDING TRUST IN THE PUBLIC AS- WITH OUR FOCUSED EFFORTS. I NEXT JUST TO SPEAK ABOUT TESTING WE'VE I RECEIVE SEVERAL TESTS FROM OUR SOCK MONKEY PUBLIC HEALTH PARTNERS- THEY HAVE BEEN EXCEPTIONAL WITH THAT WITH PROVIDING THOSE REACHED. DEPLOY THOSE TO OUR AGENCIES SO THAT IS TO. HAVE A STAFF MEMBER ONE OF OUR SOCIAL SERVICE WORKERS TEST POSITIVE THE ENTIRE SECTION IS TESTED IMMEDIATELY THAT WAY IT MITIGATES ANY SORT OF DISRUPTION. TO THAT ESSENTIAL SERVICES A WHOLE WE'VE SEEN THAT PRETTY EFFECTIVE WITH OUR FIELD SERVICES- WE JUST ENDURED ONE OF THOSE THIS WEEK. AND THAT WE'RE ABLE TO CATCH THAT PRETTY QUICKLY YOU KNOW ISOLATE THE FOLKS WHO DO TEST POSITIVE- IN SO THEY CAN GO HOME AND- AND- YOU. DEAL WITH THOSE SYMPTOMS UNTIL THEY FEEL BETTER- WITHOUT DISRUPTING THE ENTIRE SECTION. OUR POLICE AND FIRE DO THE SAME THING WITH OUR NINE ONE DISPATCH CENTERS WE KEEP AMPLE AMOUNT OF TESTS RIGHT THERE TO ISOLATE ANY SORT POTENTIAL OUTBREAK. WE HAVE SEEN PRETTY EFFECTIVE- USE OUR- OKAY OUR WORKFORCE. NOTABLY WITH THAT IS SOMEBODY DOES FEEL SICK THEY JUST SIMPLY DON'T GO IN THAT DAY AND THEY HAVE THEIR LAPTOP AND THEY HAVE THEIR THEIR HOME WORKSTATION THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO CONTINUE. DOING THE WORK WE HAVEN'T SEEN A LOT OF SICK PANDEMIC WITH THE USE OF THIS HYBRID MODEL. FOLKS JUST CONTINUE OPERATING AT HOME MAYBE POTENTIALLY EXPERIENCING MILD SYMPTOMS BUT THERE'S NO DISRUPTION TO OPERATIONS AND SO THAT'S BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE WE DO PLAN TO KEEP THE HYBRID MODEL IN PLACE. IN DURING I DON'T THINK THAT'LL EVER CHANGE. AND IS LONG AS THE WORK'S GETTING DONE IN OUR OFFICE CENTRAL SERVICES AND IN OUR ECONOMY OF OPERATIONS IS NOT IMPACTED. WE'LL JUST MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT IN THE- IN IN IN. PRETTY MUCH A PERMANENT POSTURE. A SPECIFIC TO P. P. EARLY ON THE PANDEMIC WE WENT INTO THIS- EVENT. WITH ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND N. NINETY FIVE MASKS THAT THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO STARK THAT WAS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN OFFICE OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SACRAMENTO FIRE. WE WERE NOT SELFISH WITH THOSE MASKED WE WERE DEPLOYING THOSE OUT WE GAVE THE HOSPITAL'S FAR NORTH IS READING. GAVE OUT TEN THOUSAND WERE TO THE VET- VA HOSPITAL DOWN IT MAY THIRD. WE SUPPLIED OTHER COUNTIES JURISDICTIONS EVERY SINGLE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY AND FIRE AGENCY. IN THIS REGION RECEIVE MASKS IF THEY WANTED THEM- WE KNEW AND UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY NINETY FIVE IS THE BEST PROTECTION WITH THAT. SINCE THEN WITH GOOD PARTNERSHIP FROM THE STATE WHICH WE'RE VERY THANKFUL FOR THEY REPLENISH THOSE STOCKS. WE NEVER GOT DEPLETED ALL THE WAY DOWN- BUT WE DID WE DID HIT LEVELS ABOUT FORTY FORTY FIVE PERCENT. OF THAT. BUT AGAIN- THAT WASN'T JUST USED TO BURN RATE FROM THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO. THAT WAS DISBURSING GOES OUT TO ALL OF OUR MUTUAL AID PARTNERS IN ANYBODY WHO WANTED THEM. THERE WAS NEVER REQUEST THE CAME IN FOR AN IN NINETY FIVE MASK FROM A- A SENIOR LIVING FACILITY A HOSPITAL ANY OF THOSE HEALTH CARE. PARTNERS AND WERE DENIED WE SUPPORTED EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE REQUESTS AND CONTINUE TO DO SO AS THEY COME IN- WE PARTNER VERY CLOSELY WITH. THE SENIOR LIVING FACILITIES EARLY HONOR STANDING THAT THE ELDERLY AND FOLKS WITH VULNERABLE UNDERLYING MENTAL CONDITIONS. WERE THE MOST AT RISK FOR THE VIRUS. AT SEVERAL OF THOSE. HAVE SINCE. YOU OTHERS. ROUTES BUT EARLY ON WHEN THE PP WAS WAS PRETTY LOW AND HARD TO COME BY WE MAKE SURE THAT WE BACKSTOPS THEIR SUPPLIES. THAT THEY HAD SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS. I SINCE THEN WE'VE REBUILT THOSE STOCKS AND IN ARE READY FOR IT YOU KNOW THEY NINETY FIVE COURSES- VERY PROFICIENT AT. PROTECTING AS WILDFIRE SMOKE PARTICULATES WHICH WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BE IN DURING HERE THIS SUMMER- IF HISTORY IS ANY INICATION IN THE IN THE CLIMATE IS HOW IT IS. SO- WE ARE READY FOR THAT AND- IN ANY SORT OF POTENTIAL. OUTBREAK WE DO HAVE SUFFICIENT PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT ON HAND- TO ENSURE THAT JUST AS WE WERE BEFORE. AND THEN. I WILL CLOSE OFF THAT I'VE BEEN SPEAKING QUITE A BIT WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS EDUCATIONAL LEADERS AND DOCTORS. WE ARE VERY THANKFUL FROM A LOCAL PERSPECTIVE TO THE STATE THAT WE HAVE NOT REGRESSED IN IMPLEMENTED ANY SORT OF MANDATES. ESPECIALLY NOTABLE TO THE TO THE CHILDREN. AND IN IN THE SCHOOLS THAT HAS BEEN A HUGE POINT OF CONTENTION FOR US. AT THE SCHOOL BOARD MIESES SO FORTH- NOW JUST SHARE WITH YOU THAT ESSENTIAL SERVICE CHILD CARE WORKER PROGRAMS WAS IMPLEMENTED BY THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO EARLY ON THE PANDEMIC. SO WHILE THE SCHOOL SHUT DOWN. A LOT OF THOSE STUDENTS JUST COULDN'T STAY AT HOME THEY HAD PARENTS WHO WERE FIREFIGHTERS POLICE OFFICERS DOCTORS. WE COMMUNITY CENTERS. HAVE CHILDREN GOING TO SCHOOLS AND BEING TAUGHT BY EDUCATORS. THEY WENT TO OUR COMMUNITY CENTERS AND WERE WATCHED BY OUR YOUTH PARKS AND REC. FOLKS I MEAN THESE WERE THESE WERE NOT SKILLED EDUCATORS BUT THEY DID THEIR BEST- AND I JUST VERY PROUD OF OUR FOLKS FOR. BASICALLY OPENING UP PSEUDO SCHOOLS. AND SO- FROM A LOCAL PERSPECTIVE JUST VERY CANDIDLY I DO WANT TO SAY. I DO APPRECIATE AS WE IN DURING THESE ADDITIONAL WAVES THAT YOU'RE NOT SHUTTING DOWN THE SCHOOLS YOU'RE NOT GETTING AGGRESSIVE WITH THE MASK MANDATES. FOR CHILDREN- BECAUSE WE ARE SEEING A- AND I'D SEE AN INCREASE IN TRUST AND CONFIDENCE BY OUR OUR LOCAL. BEAUTY THAT WE'RE NOT DOING. ANY SO AGAIN OUR PRIMARY FOCUS IF AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IS TO CONTINUE FORTIFYING. THE SENIOR LIVING FACILITIES. PARTNER WITH THE HOSPITALS TO MAKE SURE THE MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS ARE PROTECTED WHICH ARE ELDERLY AND THOSE WITH UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITIONS. AND THEN TO. PROVIDE THAT THAT DURING SUPPORT TO OUR EMPLOYEES AND PARTNER AGENCIES. SO THEY ARE CENTRAL SERVICES DO NOT GET DISRUPTED- WHEN FOLKS AFTER YOU- CALL OUT. WHETHER THEY'RE ILL OR OR SO FORTH SO. YOUR QUESTIONS- JIM AND THAT CONCLUDES MY BRIEF. WHAT THANK YOU DINNER APPRECIATE YOUR INPUT NOW LET'S- ARE NOT STUBBORN ON THE FIRST PANEL IT'S A DOCTOR AMY. SISK CAL HOW. THE YELLOW. SERVICES AGENCY OUR DOCTOR ARE YOU AVAILABLE. YEAH I AM CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN. OKAY GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE YOUR COUNTIES EXPERIENCE TRANSITIONING TO THE NEXT OF OUR COVERED NINETEEN RESPONSE. IN MID FEBRUARY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RELEASED IT SMARTER PLAN THE SMARTER PLAN PAINTS A PICTURE OF WHAT THE NEXT PHASE OF THE STATE CODE RESPONSE WILL LOOK LIKE AND IT OUTLINES ACTIONS THE STATE WILL TAKE. A SMARTER PLAN OF THE STATE PLAN RATHER THAN A LOCAL PLAN AND I DON'T VIEW MY CHARGES YOU'LL COUNTY HEALTH OFFICER AS BEING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SMARTER PLAN PER SE. WHILE THE SMARTER PLAN DOESN'T OUTLINE SPECIFIC ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN BY LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THE ACRONYM SMARTER THAT FORMS THE BASIS OF THE PLAN. STILL SERVES AS A USEFUL FRAMEWORK FOR YELLOW COUNTY AS WE TRANSITION INTO THE NEXT PHASE OF THE CURVE NINETEEN RESPONSE. I'D LIKE TO BRIEFLY REVIEW YOUR COUNTIES APPROACH TO THE SEVEN FOCUS. OF THE SMARTER PLAN. MATH AWARENESS READY TO CASTING EDUCATION AND TREATMENT OR R. ACTS. LET'S BEGIN WITH SHOT VACCINES ARE THE MOST POWERFUL WEAPON WE HAVE AGAINST SEVERE DISEASE HOSPITALIZATION AND DEATH FROM COVERT NINETEEN. INYO COUNTY 74% OF RESIDENTS FIVE AND OLDER HAVE COMPLETED A PRIMARY THEORIES OF THE COMPANY BAXEEN. OVER EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND DOSES OF VACCINE HAVE BEEN PROVIDED BY YOLO COUNTY ITSELF AS A VACCINE PROVIDER SINCE DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY. WE ENVISION A FUTURE IN WHICH THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM TAKES OWNERSHIP OVER COVERT NINETEEN VACCINATION MUCH LIKE IT DOES FOR ANNUAL INFLUENZA VACCINATION BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET. AS MUCH AS YOLO COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH WOULD LIKE TO- DEMOBILIZE THEIR COVERT ACTION NATION TEAM AFTER A YEAR AND A HALF OF CLINICS WE EXPECT THAT PUBLIC HEALTH WILL PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN VACCINATING CHILDREN UNDER FIVE LIKELY BEGINNING NEXT MONTH. I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE INCENTIVES OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS OFFERING TO PROVIDERS TO VACCINATE CHILDREN. BUT HEALTH CARE PROVIDER ENROLLMENT REMAINS WELL. THE NEXT FOCUS AREA MATH IS ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING. PROPERLY WORN MASKS WITH GOOD FILTRATION HELP FLOW THE SPREAD OF COVERT NINETEENTH. WHEN THE STATE ENDED ITS MASKING MANDATE IN MOST INDOOR SETTINGS IN MARCH WE TRANSITION TO STRONGLY RECOMMENDING MASK. A STRONG RECOMMENDATION WAS FRAMED AS PART OF A CONTINUUM RANGING FROM MATH OPTIONAL TO RECOMMENDED TO STRONGLY RECOMMENDED AND REQUIRED. HOWEVER NO DETAILS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED AS TO WHEN MOVEMENT BETWEEN THESE LEVELS WILL OCCUR. THIS LACK OF TRANSPARENCY UNDERMINES CONFIDENCE IN PUBLIC HEALTH AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. THE STATE HAS MAINTAINED A STRONG RECOMMENDATION FOR MASKING SINCE MARCH FIRST. IN MARCH AND TODAY THE CASE READ IN YOLO COUNTY HAS RANGED FROM FOUR TO TWENTY ONE CASES PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND RESIDENTS PER DAY REPRESENTING MODERATE SUBSTANTIAL AND HIGH COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION IN TURN. OF A LOCAL HEALTH OFFICER MY HANDS HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY TIED BY THE STATE'S APPEARANCE TO A STRONG RECOMMENDATION TO MASK EVEN IF CASE RATES PLUNGED LOCALLY. WHEN THE LOCAL CASE RATE WAS FOUR I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO MESSAGE THAT MASKING HAD BECOME OPTIONAL BUT I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ALIGNED WITH STATE MESSAGING. WHEN THE CASE RATE BEGAN RISING I WOULD HAVE STEPPED UP MY RECOMMENDATION ACCORDING TO TRANSMISSION RISK. INSTEAD I'VE BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG THAT MASTER STRONGLY RECOMMENDED AND PEOPLE HAVE STOPPED LISTENING. IF WE WANT HE PUBLIC TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN PUBLIC HEALTH MESSAGING WE MUST BE MORE NIMBLE AND ARE MASKING RECOMMENDATIONS ADJUSTING THEM AS THE RISK OF JOSH. I UNDERSTAND THE CDPH OF DEVELOPING METRICS FOR WHEN TO INCREASE MASKING RECOMMENDATIONS I WENT TO DECREASE THEM AND I VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO THE RELEASE OF THIS MUCH NEEDED FRAMEWORK. MOVING TO AWARENESS THE SMARTER PLAN CALLS OUT THE IMPORTANCE OF STAYING AWARE OF HOW KOBE NINETEEN IS SPREADING EVOLVING VARIANCE AND COMMUNICATING CLEARLY HOW PEOPLE SHOULD PROTECT THEMSELVES. THIS LAST PIECE COMMUNICATING CLEARLY IS AN AREA NEEDING ONGOING ATTENTION AND INVESTMENTS. WE HAVE OVER COMPLICATED MUCH OF OUR CO THAT GUIDANCE AND ALSO FAILED TO ADJUST THEM AS REF CHANGED OVER TIME. I ENCOURAGE INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNICATION AS PART OF READY TO WHICH I'LL RETURN TO IN A MOMENT. INYO COUNTY WE'RE FORTUNATE TO HAVE TREMENDOUS VISIBILITY INTO CIRCULATING STAR KOBE TO VARIOUS. IN REAL TIME THE UC DAVIS GENOME CENTER GENOTYPES EVERY POSITIVE TEST ON THE UC DAVIS CAMPUS AND THROUGH HEALTHY YELLOW TOGETHER LARGE COMMUNITY TESTING PROGRAM. WHEN MY COLLEAGUES IN OTHER COUNTIES HAD ONLY SEEN DELAYED A WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING RESULTS FOR A HANDFUL OF OMICRON CASES IN JANUARY I WAS ABLE TO SAY THAT ALL MICRON WAS ALREADY THE DOMINANT VARIANT AND YELLOW COUNTY WHICH ALLOWED OUR PROVIDERS TO ADJUST THEIR TREATMENTS ACCORDINGLY. NOW AS UNREPORTED HOMES HAS BECOME MORE POPULAR AND WE INCREASE RELIANCE ON WASTE WATER SURVEILLANCE TO A FAST COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION. I AM GRATEFUL TO HAVE MULTIPLE YOLO COUNTY WASTE SITES MONITORED FREQUENTLY BY PARTNERS AT UC DAVIS AND STANFORD AND I HOPE SUCH NETWORKS CAN BE EXTENT EXPANDED STATEWIDE. WITHIN THE FOCUS AREA OF RIGHT ENOUGH WE RECOGNIZE THAT KOBE NINETEEN. BONTA COVERT SEARCHES AS WELL AS FUTURE PANDEMICS. INYO COUNTY WE ARE ANALYZING OUR RESPONSE TO DATE IN ORDER TO BUILD ON LESSONS LEARNED OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. ONE LESSON IS ALREADY VERY CLEAR WE DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH TRAINED STAFF TO RESPOND TO KOBE NINETEEN AND WE FELL BEHIND IN OUR RESPONSE AS A RESULT. I WAS PLEASED TO SEE THAT THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH. BUT THIS INVESTMENT IS NOT OFF TO PONDER THE LONGSTANDING AROSE IN OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE. WE NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO INVEST IN A PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE PIPELINE ALONG WITH WORKFORCE RETENTION. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONSIDER FURTHER SUPPORTING AND STRENGTHENING OUR CRITICAL LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE. INITIATIVES SUCH AS THE PUBLIC HEALTH EQUITY AND READY ENOUGH OPPORTUNITY OR HERO WOULD HELP ENSURE WE APPLY THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE COBIT PANDEMIC TO BE READY FOR THE NEXT PANDEMIC. MOVING ON TO TESTING. TESTING HELPS TO MINIMIZE THE SPREAD OF COVERT NINETEEN. INYO COUNTY WE HAVE BENEFITTED FROM WIDELY AVAILABLE FROM BASED PCI TESTING OFFERED BY HEALTHY YOU'LL TOGETHER A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN UC DAVIS YOLO COUNTY AND SO ANNUAL COUNTY AND IT HAD THE HIGHEST PER CAPITA TESTING RATED CALIFORNIA FROM MUCH OF THE PANDEMIC- THIS TESTING. WILL ADD ON JUNE THIRTIETH REPRESENTING A MAJOR TRANSITION IN OUR COVERT RESPONSE. WE ARE INVESTING IN A TESTING FUTURE CENTERED ON HOLD ANTIGEN TEST. DOCUMENTED BY TESTING BY HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND PHARMACIES. WE ARE PREPARING TO LAUNCH A VENDING MACHINE PILOT PROGRAM THAT WILL DISTRIBUTE FREE HOME ANTIGEN TEST IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND CONTINUE TO MASTERS THE AVAILABILITY OF FREE ANTIGEN TEST FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS THROUGH INSURANCE REIMBURSEMENT. YOUR COUNTY REMAINS GRATEFUL TO CDPH FOR ITS ONGOING SUPPORT OF AN OPTUM SERVE TESTING LOCATION IN YOUR COUNTY ALONG WITH OUTBREAK TESTING SUPPORT PROVIDED BY STATE OUTBREAK RESPONSE TEAMS THAT HAVE SUPPORTED TESTING IN OUR JAIL AND IN OUR SCHOOLS. SPEAKING OF SCHOOL FOR THE FOCUS AREA OF EDUCATION OUR SCHOOL COATED RESPONSE HAS EVOLVED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THE SMARTER PLAN WAS REALLY. THE EMPLOYEE OF GREW CONTACT TRACY IF OF INTO. CALL TREE HUNDRED THE WERE FOR SCHOOL STAFF WITHOUT. STUDENT SAFETY. FOR THEN YOU'RE LOOKING ARE A TO WHAT ROLE THEY WILL BE A TO PLAY AND HAS DURING THE NEXT ACADEMIC YEAR I THINK TO RETURN THEIR TO TEACHING AND AWAY FROM FACILITATING. WE HOPE THAT OUR COMMUNITY EVENT MACHINE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DISTRIBUTE TEST FIFTY AND FAMILIES WITH MINIMAL STAFF WORK. FINALLY IN THE AREA OF TREATMENT YOUR COUNTY OF EXCITED THAT THE STATE SPONSORED OPTUM SERVES FIGHT IN WOODLAND IS NOW ATTACHED TO TREAT LOCATION. PASSAGE BRING TEST A PROVIDER VISIT AND PRESCRIPTION FOR A THERAPEUTIC AND DISPENSING OF THAT THERAPEUTIC UNDER ONE ROOF MAKING IT EASY FOR THOSE AT HIGH RISK OF SEVERE DISEASE TO QUICKLY ACCESS. TREATMENTS LIKE PARK SLOPE IT. HAVING OFTEN SERVE AS A ONE STOP SHOP IS A HUGE WIN BUT ITS IMPACT WILL LIKELY BE NARROW. NOW WIDELY AVAILABLE AND PHARMACIES HAVE PLENTY OF TAX WILL BID BUT FOR MOST PEOPLE WHO TEST POSITIVE THE CHALLENGES AND HAVING A PROVIDER GETTING INTO SEE THAT PROVIDER WITHIN DAYS OF TESTING POSITIVE AND HAVING THAT PROVIDER BE COMFORTABLE PRESCRIBING PACKED FULL OF IT. I THAT IF WIDE. CAN BE DEVELOPED OUTSIDE OF OFTEN SERVE TO SUPPORT ADDITIONAL CALIFORNIANS IN ACCESSING TREATMENT PROVIDERS ALONG WITH PROVIDING INCENTIVES FOR LARGE HEALTH SYSTEMS TO IMPLEMENT TOUGH TO TREAT MODELS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY ABOUT YOLO COUNTY IS INVOLVING KOBE NINETEEN. THANK YOU DOCTOR AND WITH THAT OUR BRINGING HERE TO THE MEMBERS BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE- FROM FROM THE THREE ON THE FIRST PANEL IS AT THE COUNTER ARE NOT ALWAYS A LOT BETTER TO DEAL WITH THAT- AS WE DID IN THE BEGINNING OF THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC AND THAT'S WHY PART OF THE HEARING HERE TO SEE HOW ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES ARE BETTER. TO PER TO RESPOND TREAT AND HAVE- PLAN AND MOST PROBABLY HAVE THE STOCKPILES OF THE PP THINGS THAT WE NEED- IN A BETTER PLACE SO IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU THINK WE CAN LOOK AT- FROM ANYBODY THAT'S ON THE FIRST PANEL I WE CAN DELIVER BETTER. YOUR THINGS SEEM TO BE FALLING INTO PLACE FOR ONE OF MY MOTHER'S THAT DIFFERENT SEARCHES THAT COM- IS THERE ANYTHING BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENT- US- ARIENS. OF THE- DISEASE THAT WOULD COME THAT WE NEED TO ADAPT DIFFERENTLY OR I THINK SOME LIKE EVERYTHING'S PRETTY GOOD ON THAT AND BUT IF ANYBODY ELABORATE. A WHAT IF WANT IN DOWN AFTER SIR TO. KIND OF REINFORCE AGAIN TOO I THINK THE COMMUNITY THAT YOU KNOW MILD TO MODERATE SMPTOMS DON'T GO TO THE HOSPITAL'S. AND- YOU KNOW SELF TREAT- CONTACT- YOU HELL CARE PROVIDER THAN ALL BEEN A HUGE WHEN I'VE- I KNOW IN OUR OUR COUNTY SACRAMENTO COUNTY THEY'VE BEEN ADVERTISING THAT. THEY STARTED OUT OF A COUPLE MONTHS AGO AND THE TRANSITION HAS BEEN HAS BEEN HUGE I READ A STUDY IN AND MY APOLOGIES I CAN'T QUOTE WHO WAS FROM BUT- IT WAS TAKEN BACK INTO BELIEVE IS JANUARY- BUT IF THERE WAS A VERY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE POPULATION THAT FELT STILL. EVEN IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO THAT IF YOU GOT C ING TO PERISH AND WHICH I THINK THROUGH BETTER EDUCATION FROM PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS OVER THESE PAST COUPLE MONTHS. THAT HAS- YOU KNOW THAT HELPED INCREASE THE AWARENESS AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE VIRUS- WHILE WHILE IT CAN BE VERY TRAGIC. THEY HAD TO. DO IT IT IS. IT'S A SAID. WHERE IF YOU. TEST POSITIVE AND YOU'RE A SYMPTOMATIC THE NEED TO RUSH DOWN TO A HOSPITAL DEMAND TO BE- TO BE ADMITTED. TO IT AND THEN THE OTHER THING IS JUST. SIMILAR WHAT WE'RE DOING I FEEL A IN OUR- IN OUR CITY. I DEPARTMENTS IN ORGANIZATION PUSHING TESTS MPPT DOWN TO THAT DEPARTMENT LEVEL IF THERE'S A WAY TO JUST MAKE SURE THAT THE SCHOOLS HAVE THAT TESTING IN PP PUSHED DOWN TO THEIR LEVEL AS WELL WITH THE REINFORCED UNDERSTANDING THAT WE'LL- THE CLOSING OF THE SCHOOLS FOR DIFFERENT VARIANTS IS JUST NOT GOING TO BE AN ACCEPTABLE ROUTE FORWARD. AND INDIO WHILE TEACHERS MAY FEEL THE NEED TO HAVE ANY NINETY FIVE THE HOBBIT READILY AVAILABLE- AND I KNOW I'VE I SPOKE WITH MY SAFETY AND SECURITY FOLKS FROM THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN MY IN MY CITY AND I AYE REINFORCE DEMAND THEIR FACILITIES STAFF THAT IF THEY NEED ANY SUPPLIES. I'LL HAVE THAT ON THEIR DOORSTEP THE NEXT DAY- THAT WAY THEY UNDERSTAND FULLY THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE SCHOOLS NEED TO DO UNLESS IT'S UNLESS IT'S A VERY SIGNIFICANT- FUTURE PANDEMIC- THAT IS MUCH MORE LETHAL NEED TO KEEP SCHOOL OPEN OKAY. THANK YOU CERTAIN SO IT I THINK THE FRAMEWORK- THAT HAS BEEN LATER OUT THE SMARTER PLAN- I THINK IT'S A GOOD FRAMEWORK FOR- ADDRESSING COVERT GOING FORWARD TO BE DONE STILL- BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF UNKNOWNS WE- HAVE NO LONG TERM STUDIES. THAT ARE IT GIVE US. ALL THE EXACT ANSWERS THAT WE NEED AND SO WHAT I THINK YOU HAVE A WILL FLUID IS GONNA BE A- AS WE FORWARD. THE BACK ISSUE I THINK IT'S MOVED FROM AVAIL. WHICH WERE IMPACT LARGELY TO NOW I THINK IT'S READILY AVAILABLE EVERYWHERE ANY OF THE- FROM THIS. IN OF THE COUNTY'S ANY ISSUES THE VEIL OF VACCINE. AND AT AND SITES WHERE PEOPLE CAN GO GET VACCINATED BECAUSE I DON'T SEE LONG LINES ANYMORE I DON'T SEE ANY OF THAT ISSUES. HI THIS IS DOCTOR SUSAN ANNUAL ACCOUNTING CAN SAY THAT WE HAVE NO SHORTAGE OF A VACCINE AND WE HAVE- AMPLE. PLACE ALTHOUGH WE DO ANTICIPATE ON AS I MENTIONED IN IN MY TESTIMONY A SHORTAGE OF PROVIDERS WHO ARE WILLING TO- PROVIDE VACCINES TO THE UNDER FIVE AGE GROUP WICH WE ANTICIPATE WILL BE AUTHORIZED IN JUNE- AND I KNOW THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS HAD AN INCENTIVE TO RECRUIT- THE EXISTING VACCINE PROVIDERS OF OTHER VACCINES TO PROVIDE KOBE BACK IN ASIANS AND SO THAT. THAT WORK IS ON BUT NO YELLOW COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH INTENDS TO CAN GIVING VACCINATIONS. TO THE UNDER FIVE POPULATION- I IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE ADEQUATE ACCESS. SO IT'S TO SAY THAT THE- PEOPLE THAT WISH TO GET A VACCINE. HAVE FULL ACCESS AND AVAILABILITY OF THE VACCINE TO GO GET IF THEY WISH CORRECT. AT THE COUNTY LEVEL SUCH INTERESTING AND COUNTY LEVELS SIR I CAN SAY- THAT WE'VE BEEN RUNNING THESE PUBLIC VACCINE CLINICS SINCE EARLY SPRING LAST YEAR AND WE HAVE NEVER TURNED A PERSON AWAY EVEN AS OF LAST SPRING SO TO YOUR RATE POINT YOUR SPOT ON AND- WE'VE- ENGAGE LINGUIST. L. A. FO TAKE REACH TO THOSE REALLY TO REACH NEIGHBORHOODS THROUGH CA BASED. FOR THE TRUST ASPECT OF IT WE'VE NEVER TURN ANYBODY AWAY- FROM A VACCINE. NEWS I GUESS WHAT I'M GETTING AT ALSO IS THAT AT SOME POINT WE'VE SATURATED. THE VACCINATION. OUTREACH AND ABILITY. AND IT'S AVAILABLE TO THOSE THAT WANT TO AND THOSE THAT DON'T ARE JUST NOT GOING TO GET IT. ABSOLUTELY AND TO OUT THE COUNTY HEALTH OFFICER FOR WE'RE ALSO SEEING THAT. TO SEVERAL OF PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS- MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS THEY ARE ALSO JUST NOT READY TO DISTRIBUTE TO THAT TO THE YOUNG CHILDREN UNDER UNDER FIVE OKAY GREAT. WILL MOVE ON TO. LOCAL COMMUNITY HOSPITALS- IN YOUR DISTRICTS IN THE COUNTY AREAS. DO THEY HAVE THE SAME PERCEPTION OF HOW THIS IS WORKING AS- THE YOUR COUNTY HEALTH OFFICES AND WOULD YOU HAVE. THE COMMUNICATION YOU NEED WITH THEM- REGARDING PP AVAILABILITY- SUPPLY CHAIN- ISSUES ANYTHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE I KEEP HEARING FROM WHEN I'M SPEAKING TO PEOPLE IN THE PRE ARE IN THE HOUSE. CARES THAT THERE WHEN YOU CAN TO BE THE UP. THE PP WHEN WE HAVE SURGES. SO IF YOU IF THE THREE OF YOU MAY BE ABLE TO GIVE US SOME INDICATION OF WHAT- WHERE WE'RE AT- WITH THOSE COMMUNICATIONS AND ADDRESSING THE HOSPITAL. NEEDS SO THAT THEY ARE WELL PREPARED AND THERE'S NO SAP SUPPLY CHAIN- DISRUPTIONS- WHEN WIND A SURGEON KERR'S. I YES SIR OUR VERY CLOSELY WITH MY HOSPITAL COORDINATORS AND FROM THE EARLY ON THE PANDEMIC I MENTIONED THAT- THE INITIAL- THE INITIAL. FIRST WAS IN NINE FIVE AND IT'S BECAUSE OF OUR WILDFIRE PREPAREDNESS FOR THE SMOKE ACROSS THE COMMUNITY WE HAD. AMPLE AMOUNTS OF IN NINETY FIVE AND WE DISTRIBUTE THOSE OUT WITH THAT RELATIONSHIP BUILDING OF PROVIDING THOSE IN NINETY FIVE- MASS THROUGHOUT THE HOSPITAL NETWORK WE DEVELOP GOOD. ORDINATION AND COMMUNICATION I HAVE NOT HEARD FROM MY HOSPITALS IF THEY'RE THEY'RE SHORT ON THAT I FEEL THAT THEY WOULD BE CONFIDENT TO COME TO MYSELF OR OUR- THE CITY. TO RECEIVE IN NINETY FIVE IF THEY NEEDED IT- I HAVEN'T HEARD AT LEAST IN SACRAMENTO- YOU NEED OF CONCERN ABOUT P. BUT- I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK COMPLETELY FOR THE HOSPITALS THEY MIGHT HAVE LIKE YOU SAID SIR DEFERRED. YOUR DURING- DURING DIFFERENT WAVES THEY MIGHT HAVE SHORT SHORTER- LIMIT ON PP BUT I HAVEN'T. HAD ANY S. ANY ISSUES COME TO MY ATTENTION. AND THE OTHERS. IN IN YOUR COUNTY AYE MEET REGULARLY WITH OUR HOSPITAL LEADERSHIP AND I WOULD SAY FOR THE FIRST COUPLE COBIT WAIVES THE CHALLENGE WITH CERTAINLY AVAILABILITY OF PP. I THINK NOW THAT SUPPLY CHAINS ARE ARE FLOWING OUT PROPERLY AND OUR MOLOCH PROGRAM IS ALSO AVAILABLE AS SORT OF AS A AS A BACKUP IF. A HOSPITAL IS NOT ABLE TO ACT OF P. P. A. I WOULD SAY THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE THAT OUR HOSPITALS EXPERIENCED AND IN THE LAST WAVE AND WITH THIS CURRENT INCREASE IN IN CASE IF THE SCARCITY. IS IN STAFFING IS NOT IN PP- R. MANY STAFF THEMSELVES HAVE BEEN INFECTED WITH OVER NINETEEN AND HAVE NOT BEEN AVAILABLE TO WORK AND SO THAT IS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE CURRENTLY FACING OUR HOSPITALS. YEAH AND I THINK THAT STAFFING ISSUES SOMETHING I'VE HEARD OVER AND OVER AND- IT'S A BIG ISSUE IN PART OF IT IS FUELED BY- WELL BEING. AFRAID TO GO INTO THAT FIELD ANYMORE. AND SO WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT ENVIRONMENT IS AS SAFE. AS WE CAN MAKE IT AND THEY HAVE THE PP THEY NEED TO BE FEEL CONFIDENT. THAT THEIR JOB CAN BE DONE AND THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE OVERWORKED. AND SO THAT'S A THAT'S A HUGE ISSUE HERE IN CALIFORNIA- SO THE- THE DOCTOR. JUST SAID YOU HAD BROUGHT UP THE ISSUE OF LOCAL HEALTH ADVISORIES VERSUS STATE ORDERS. AND THE FLEXIBILITY THAT THE COUNTIES NEED. TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO WHAT'S GOING ON IN THEIR COUNTY RESTRICTION GUYS ARE BEING AFFORDED THAT. AND THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT THE STATE IS STILL DOING THE DOING THE MAIN ORDER AND THEN THAT COUNTIES ARE STUCK TRYING TO IMPLEMENT SOMETHING THAT'S NOT REALLY SUITABLE FOR THEIR COUNTY THAT RIGHT- IT'S A IT'S A SLIGHTLY MORE NUANCED AND NOT WHEN IT COMES TO THE MASKING PIECE THE CHALLENGE HERE WAS WAS NOT HAVING A STATE ORDER PER SE. THAT WAS STRICTER THAN THE STATE WE ARE TALKING RECOMMENDATION. SO THERE IS NOT- DOES THE SAME LEVEL OF OBLIGATION FOR A COUNTY STILL TO FOLLOW ITS STATE RECOMMENDATION AS THAT IS WHAT THE STATE ORDER BUT I THINK THAT THE CHALLENGES MORE ON COMMUNICATION. AND ENSURING THAT THERE IS A FRAMEWORK PLACE FOR HOW WE CAN YOU. ABOUT MASKING RECOMMENDATIONS BUT I WOULD SAY IN IN GENERAL- MANY COUNTIES ARE APPRECIATIVE OF THE STATE'S. TO ISSUE STATE ORDERS BECAUSE IN MANY CASES. THERE IS NOT THE STEP. QUEUE IS THOSE THAT'LL LEVEL. RIGHT THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHY YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT IS- A LOT OF TIMES OF SPECIAL SCHOOL BOARDS. THEY WANT THEY WANT SOMEBODY ELSE TO GIVE THOSE ORDERS SO THAT THEY CAN. THEY CAN BE COMPLIANT AND- AND BE ABLE TO TELL PEOPLE IT'S NOT THERE. THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO. CREATE THAT- SO WE HAVE TO FIND BALANCE SO YOU GUYS STILL HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY YOU NEED. WITHOUT DOING THAT I'LL LET OTHERS ASK QUESTIONS FIVE EXHAUSTED A COUPLE DIFFERENT THINGS. I FRANKLY. DON'T HAVE FIRST WELL YOU TO OUR PUBLIC HEALTH OF PEOPLE THE DONE SUCH INCREDIBLE. I KNOW WE HAD SOME ROUGH SPOTS IN THE BEGINNING HOWEVER YOU'VE ALL. SO MANY OF US THROUGHOUT OUR DISTRICTS. BUT I'M REALLY EXCITED I'M FROM YOU'LL COUNTY DOCTORS THE SUN'S DONE INCREDIBLE JOB. AND THE THING THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT IS THAT WE'VE BUILT TRUST. AND ALL. TRUST WITHIN YOUR COMMUNITIES AND THE STATE SPONSORED OPTUM SERVES CITING THE WOODLAND IS SO EXCITING AND SO MANY PEOPLE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT IT IS AND I SUPPOSE HAVE A ONE STOP SHOP. AND CONGRATULATIONS ON DOING THAT I WILL BE LOOKING FOR TO SEE HOW THE DATA GOES HOW MANY PEOPLE ATTEND. BUT I THINK IT REALLY HAS TO SAY A LOT TO ALL OF YOU IS THAT PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO UNDERSTAND THIS. UNDERSTAND THE DATA THT'S BEEN PER PROVIDED WE ONLY CAN GET BETTER BUT WE DO NEED TO BE READY FOR THAT NEXT PANDEMIC AND I THINK WE'RE STARTING TO PUT THOSE STONES AND- THINGS IN PLACES WE GO FORWARD TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR YOUR TIME AND THANK YOU FOR ALL ATTENDING TODAY. K. THING YOU FOR. NO COME CHECK. WE CAN MOVE ON. TO THE SECOND PANEL. AND OVERSEE A LOT OF LESSONS LEARNED AND IT SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE- NOT A BETTER PLACE NOW. HEARING FROM OUR FOLKS ON THE FIRST PANEL. SO NOW MOVE ON TO THE SECOND PANEL. REGARDING THE STATE PROGRESS ON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MINISTRATIONS MOTOR PLANT. SO WITH THAT FIRST LET'S HEAR FROM DOCTOR THOMAS. UNDERGONE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA PALM TO PUBLIC HEALTH. CDPH AND THE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER- DOCTOR ARE YOU AVAILABLE. YEAH GOOD MORNING EVERYONE- YOU TO RETURN STEP HEALTH OFF. IN DIRECTOR OF THE CAL. DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH. I THE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON CALIFORNIA'S SMARTER PLAN. THAT RELEASED ON FOR. SEVENTH OF THIS YEAR- I WANT TO GIVE. THANKS TO THE LOW- FOR. HEALTH AND- YEAH. SYSTEMS AND ASSEMBLYMEMBERS FOR. EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE TO SUPPORT. ALL THAT EFFORTS. I THINK THEY- FIGHTING THIS PAY. HAS BEEN A TOTAL. EFFORT IT HAS BEEN JUST OVER TWO YEARS AND TWO MONTHS. GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY FOR CALIFORNIA RESPONSE TO THE COMPANY. PANDEMIC THAT EMERGE IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN. FOR WITHIN ONE YEAR- EFFECTIVE VACCINES AVAIL BY MID DECEMBER OF TWENTY. IN THE WAY TO TWENTY ONE WE- A LARGE OF CO NINETEEN AND WE'VE RAISED DIVAC'S AS MANY CAL. AS POSSIBLE. AT OUR P. WE WERE THE MINISTRY ALMOST THREE MILLION. PER WEEK. GATHER WE WERE SUCCESSFUL AND WERE ABLE TO RETIRE THE BLUEPRINT FOR SAFER ECONOMY ON JUNE FIFTEEN TWENTY TWENTY. THERE WAS INITIAL. ACROSS THE UNITED STATES THAT THE WORD WITH HIGH US. ON STARS KOBE TO CONTINUE TO ME. AND AT THE WITH HIM OF NEW VERY. WE IMPACTED WITH TWO NEW WAVE THE DELTA. IN THE SUMMER OF TWO ONE AND THEN THE ALMOST VARIANT IN THE WINTER OF TWO OF TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. THELMA VARIANT INVOLVE TO BE A- CAN. AND TO INVADE IMMUNITY FROM. OR FROM PRIOR INFO. TOGETHER LISTENING YOU. RESULTED IN A LARGE NUMBER OF COVERT THREE. AND MORE. THAN THE WAY. ALL ACROSS SECTIONS TO. STAFF SHORTAGES IN MANY INDUSTRIES INCLUDING TRANSPORTATION AND HEALTH CARE. WHILE THE VACCINES ROOM AFFECT IN PREVENTING HOSPITALIZATIONS AND DEATH. THE SHEER LARGE NUMBER OF INFECTIONS ULTIMATELY ULTIMATELY LED TO A LARGER NUMBER OF HOSPITALIZATIONS AND DEATHS. AMONG THE UNVACCINATED OLDER PERSONS OR PERSONS WITH UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITIONS. BUT BY THE OMICRON WINTER WAY WE HAD ACCUMULATED CUMULATED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE VACCINES ARE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE ESPECIALLY AGAINST HOSPITALIZATIONS AND DEATH EVEN AGAINST NEW VARIANTS. PROTECTIVE IMMUNITY FROM VACCINES FOR PARTY AFFECTION WANES OVER TIME SO WE HAD TO ADD A BOOSTER. SARS COMMITTEE TOO IS AIRBORNE AND TRANSMITTED VERY EFFICIENTLY IN INDOOR CITING. MOST OF OR A SENSE AND ASYMPTOMATIC PERSONS ARE CONTAGIOUS. FOR THOSE AT THE BELL SYMPTOMS THEY'RE CONTAGIOUS TWO DAYS BEFORE THEY DEVELOP SYMPTOMS. AND THE QUALITY OF THE MASK MATTERS IS GREAT TO HEAR ALL THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE N. NINETY FIVE. WITH LAYERS OF PROTECTION IN PLACE CARE CAN BE OPEN FULL TIME FOR IN PERSON LEARNING OR HOSPITAL AND EMS SYSTEMS BECAME OVERWHELMED NOT JUST FROM COVERT. BUT ALSO FROM NON KOBE DISEASES THAT- THAT NEEDED ATTENTION BECAUSE OF THE LAID CARE WE HAVE STAFF SHORTAGES ARE FROM FROM KOBE NINE AND ALSO FROM BURNER. IT BECAME CLEAR THAT THE SARS KOBE TO WAS NOT GOING AWAY AND THE VARIANCE WOULD CONTINUE TO THREATEN. THAT IS OF IS THAT THE CASE BECAUSE SARS TO OF THE MEN IT'S AN X. THE THIEVES. BUT SOMETHING THAT'S A- ALSO TO RECOGNIZE IS THAT THIS BEFORE CALL TO VERY KENNY FALL TO. MORE SEVERE DISEASE. GIVEN EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE LEARNED ABOUT SARS COULD TO AND THE PIN. WE NEEDED TO ADOPT MINDSET OUR APPROACH TO MANAGING COBEN INFECTIONS HOW. AND DEATH AS WE MOVE INTO THE FUTURE WE NEEDED TO FINE TUNE OUR RESPONSE TO THE CURRENT THREAT. AND OUR READINESS TO RESPOND TO NEW POTENTIALLY A MORE DEADLY THREAT. TO CHANGE THIS WE DEVELOP THE SMARTER PLAN WHICH YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD THE ACRONYMS I'M JUST GONNA MENTION FEW KEY THINGS FROM EACH ONE OF THE CAT. CATEGORIES SO SHOP. THE FIRST ONE REPOR OUR FOCUS ON VACCINE AND IMMUNO. VACCINES ARE THE MOST POWERFUL WEAPON AGAINST HOSPITALIZATION AND SEVERE DISEASE. BUILDING COMMUNITY IMMUNITIES ARE MOST EFFECTIVE STRATEGY TO PROTECT HEALTH WE MUST CONTINUE TO. THE MOST VULNERABLE VACCINATE. IMPACTED COMMUNITIES. VACCINATE OUR YOUNG CHILDREN AS AS THE AS BECAUSE AS A VACCINE BECOMES AVAILABLE IS SPECIALLY PREPARING TO VACCINE THOSE LEFT VACCINATE THOSE LESS THAN FIVE. AND THEN KEEP KEEP UP TO DATE WITH OUR- UNDERSTANDING THE SCIENCE OF IMMUNITY AND AT THAT. WE HAVE A MINISTER OVER SEVENTY MILLION DOSES OVER 75% OF FIVE OF PEEPERS OF OLDER THAN FIVE HAVE RECEIVED THE PRIMARY SERIES IN OVER SEVENTY FIVE PER OF PERSONS. OVER THAN SIX FIVE HAVE RECEIVED BOOSTERS. IN TERM OF OUR VACCINE ARE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CLOSE THE GAP BETWEEN THE LOWEST THE LOWEST INCOME AREAS AND THE HIGHEST INCOME AREAS CURRENT THE VACCINE COVERAGE GAP IS ABOUT EIGHT. PERCENT BUT WE DO NEED TO WE DO NEED TO GET IT OUT LOWER. IN TERMS OF A VACCINE COVERAGE COMPARING LEVINE AND AFRICAN AMERICANS WHICH ARE ABOUT 958% COMPARE THE Y. PA. WHAT'S PER THERE'S A TEMPER. OUR COVERAGE GAP THERE THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO TRY TO CLOSE AS WELL GONNA MENTION BRIEFLY IS ABOUT MATH SO MASS REPRESENTS OUR FOCUS ON PREVENTING AIRBORNE TRANSMISSION INDOORS. THE CONCENTRATION OF VIRUS AEROSOLS CONCENTRATION INDOORS CAN BE LOWERED BY INCREASING VENTILATION FILTERING INDOOR AIR OR DISINFECTING INDOOR AIR. INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE MASKED WITH GOOD FIT INFILTRATION. CAN'T IF INFECTED DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF VIRUS AEROSOLS THEY RELEASE INTO THE INDOOR AIR. IF THEY'RE NOT INFECTED THEY CAN PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM INHALING VIRUS AEROSOLS. BECAUSE MANY INDOOR SPACES ARE POORLY VENTILATED OR AIR THOUGHT ADEQUATELY FILTERED THE ONLY. IS TO WEAR GOOD MATH THIS IS MOST IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ARE ARE VULNERABLE AND IN THOSE SETTINGS WHERE THERE IS A LOT OF TRANSIT. OR WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF VOTER. PERSONS WE ARE LOOKING AT WEAK WEEK WE CONTINUE TO UPDATE UPDATE OUR MASKING GUIDANCE AND LOOK AT THE LET THE LATEST SCIENCE. WE'VE ALSO WE ALSO WILL BE CONVENIENT INDOOR AIR QUALITY TASK FORCE TO LEARN HOW TO REDUCE INDOOR TRANSMISSION AND TO IMPROVE INDOOR. AIR QUALITY IN GENERAL. NOW AWARENESS UP REPRESENTS OUR FOCUS SURVEY OF PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS AND RESEARCH AND EVALUATION A LOT OF THESE ELEMENTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED THINGS LIKE HOLD WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING OF WASTEWATER SURVEILLANCE- ON. A COMBAT HE MISSED DISINFORMATION I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WE DEVELOP A STRONG PARTNERSHIP WITH ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TO CONDUCT RESEARCH ON LONG CODE INTO OTHER RESEARCH THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE THOUGHT THE SCIENCE THE SCIENCE OF TRANSMISSION WE'VE- WITH OVER TWO. BASED ORGANIZATIONS A THE STATE TO CONTINUE TO- FOCUS ON HOW TO MAKE THESE MITIGATION EFFORTS. BOB ALSO WANT TO MENTION THAT I'M TO GO TO THE NEXT CATEGORY WHICH IS READY KNOWS. THE READING THIS REPRESENTS OUR FOCUS ON PREPARING TO RESPOND TO THIRTY IN CASES OF. AND THE EMERGENCE OF NEW VARIANTS IT MEANS PARTNER WITH OUR AGE A THE STATE BOTH WITH LOCAL HOW SIX. TO BUILD SYSTEM THAT WE TO GET THINGS THAT READ MENTIONED GENOME C. WASTEWATERS ARE. WE HAVE A STRONG TEAM THAT DOES MATTER MODELING TO RELIEVE OUR OUR PREDICTIONS. THE POURING COMPONENT OF THIS CATEGORY IS A SUPPORTING HEALTH SYSTEMS AND YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT LATER. WITH RESPECT TO TESTING YOUR HEARD FROM THE LOCALS- HOW HOW WELL WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO TO DO TESTING. I WOULD THAT THE KEY THING THAT I DO WANT TO POINT OUT FOR TESTING I WANT TO JUST CALL OUT OF. IN ADDITION TO PARTY WITH THOUSANDS OF COMMUNITIES WE HAVE OVER THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND COMMUNITY SITES. IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE MAKING TESTING AVAILABLE HAVE TESTING FOR THE SCHOOLS. BUT THE X. NEWS THAT YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT HIS ARE OFTEN SERVE SITES TO PROVIDE A ONE STOP SHOP. WHERE YOU CAN COME IN AND GET TESTED AND BE PRESCRIBED MEDICATIONS. IF YOU IF YOU QUALIFY. BOB AND ALTHOUGH OFTEN SIR SITE THAT'S GOING TO BE NOW- CLOSE TO A HUNDRED FIFTY SITES ACROSS. THE STATE. AND OF COURSE EDUCATION IS SO IMPORTANT THE KEY THING THAT WE LEARNED ABOUT EDUCATION. IS THAT WHEN WE PUT EVERYTHING IN PLACE. THE INTERVENTIONS ARE SUCCESSFUL AT KEEPING KIDS IN SCHOOL WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IN. IN PERSON LEARNING IS FOR SCHOOL ESPECIALLY FURTHER EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. AND THEN THE LAST CATEGORY IS TREE. THIS IS REALLY THE TIER FOR ALL OF US BECAUSE AS NIETZSCHE BECOME AVAILABLE WE KNOW THAT IF YOU DO IF YOU BECOME IN FACT IN YOU TO. SYMPTOMS YOU HAVE TO START. WITH FIVE DAYS OF. AS SO IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING- OUT OF- CALLED MY ABOUT THIS LATER WERE PUSH THE AVAILABILITY OF A PACK LOW THE WORLD. WHICH IS VERY EFFECTIVE IN KEEPING PERSONS OUT OF THE HOSPITAL. AND THE LAST I WANT TO MENTION ABOUT THE- IS AT WORK. A HELL SYSTEMS INTO. WORK FOR. TO REALLY FROM. THANK YOU. THE HELL CARE SO ACROSS IS. IN OR SAFETY TO ASSIST. TO BE MORE. AND PROVIDING. TO TRY. IT AT THE IT'S IMPROVING- TED TO TREAT PROGRAMS SO THAT WE HAVE AS MUCH AVAILABLE TO EVERYBODY. IN CLOSE LEARNED OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS AND ON CALIFORNIA SUCCESSES. IT IS FLEXIBLE BY DESIGN SO THAT WE CAN RESPOND QUICKLY AS THE VIRUS CHANGES. WE MEETING THE GOALS OUTLINED IN A SMARTER PLAN AND CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH CONFIDENCE THAT WE CAN RESPOND TO WHATEVER CO THE NINETEEN HAS IN STORE FOR US. AND TO KEEP PEOPLE HEALTHY AND OUT OF THE HOSPITALS WHICH WILL KEEP CALIFORNIA OPEN. AND WE ARE USING THE SMARTER PLAN TO RESPOND NOT JUST TO THIS CURRENT STAGE. BUT ALSO TO HELP US FOR ANY TYPE OF RESPIRATORY PATHOGEN THAT WE MIGHT FACE IN THE FUTURE ON KOBE NINETEEN THIS INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE'VE DEVELOPED HELPS US FOR OTHER OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES BEYONC BEYOND COVERAGE I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE AN UPDATE WITH CITY PH THE PROGRESS AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR NOW MOVES TO THE SECOND- MEMBER- BASSINET ACTING DIRECTOR FROM RIDGE MEDICAL THIRTY EMSA. LIVED ARE YOU THERE. YES CAN YOU HEAR ME YES. GREAT GOOD MORNING JERRY MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THIS TOPIC IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU ALL AGAIN. I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO START WITH WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED AND HOW THAT'S CONTRIBUTED TO OUR PREPAREDNESS APPROACH TO. OVER THE OF THE PNW WE'VE LEARNED A TREMENDOUS. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. WE KNOW TODAY ABOUT A SINGULAR- APPROACH TO SUPPORT THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IS NOT AS A BACK. AS A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO JUST. A LITTLE BIT THE HEALTHCARE CONTINUUM CONTINUUM IS GENERALLY MADE UP OF THREE MAJOR PARTS THAT CAN. COMPARED HOW. SO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE HOUSE IS HOW CARE THIS IS A E. M. SYSTEM. IS THE HOUSE IS THE Q. CARE. THAT INTENSIVE CARE YOU. LET ME TREE IN MY SURGE FLOOR OF A HOT. IN THE BACK DOOR OF THE HOUSE IS DISCHARGING DECOMPRESSION OF A HOSPITAL TO BE ABLE TO MOVE PATIENTS TO STEP DOWN CARE FACILITIES. OR HOME THE ON THEIR CONTINUUM ARE WORKING PROPERLY ARE NOT BURDENED THAT I PAID IS ABLE TO MOVE THE CONTINUE ON. WITHOUT DELAY. WE HAVE FOUND SUCCESS IN SUPPORTING OUR HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM WE TAKE THAT COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH BUILT AROUND AND HE CAN SING CAPACITY EACH PART OF THE CONTENT. SO CAPACITY TO TRANSPORT PATIENTS CAPACITY TO HAVE PROVIDERS CARE FOR PATIENTS AND CAPACITY TO DISCHARGE PATIENTS OUT OF THE HOSPITAL. YOU SAW THAT APPROACH IN OUR RESPONSE TO OMICRON TO THE OVERCROWDED AREA WE HAD OVER TWENTY AMBULANCE PATIENT OFFLOAD TEAMS SUPPORTING THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE STATE WHY WE HAD OVER THIRTY FIVE CLINICAL CON THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED CLINICAL CARE CONTRACTS STAFF. SUPPORTING OVER TWO HUNDRED HOSPITAL STATE WIDE AND WE HAD OVER THREE HUNDRED STAFF DEPLOYED TO SUPPORT SKILLED NURSING FACILITY FACILITIES AT THE BACK DOOR. THIS COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO SUPPORTING THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IS EFFECTIVE IN ENSURING ENSURING PATIENTS MOVE THROUGH THE CONTINUE ON AND THERE'S NO BOTTLENECK IN THE SYSTEM WHICH CAN HINDER OPTIMAL PATIENT CARE. IF WE HAD ONLY SUPPORTED THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM WITH THE PLAYING A POT TEAM DURING THE LAST WINTER. THE BURDEN WITH BEEN SHIFTED FROM THE FRONT DOOR OF THE HOUSE TO INSIDE OF THE HOUSE WHICH WOULD HAVE CREATED ANOTHER BOTTLENECK BY INCREASING THE PATIENT'S SYSTEM CENSUS AND INPATIENT SETTING WITH NOT ENOUGH. TO CARE FOR THEM. THE RESPONSE DURING EACH SURGE AND PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM HAS TAUGHT US THAT PATIENT THROUGHPUT IS GENERALLY THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN MITIGATING SEARCH. AS THE SMARTER PLAN LAYS OUT WE ARE POISED AND READY TO SUPPORT OUR HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM AND THE COMPREHENSIVE WAY IN THIS COMPREHENSIVE WAY. AS A SMARTER PLAN OUTLINES WE HAVE SEVERAL CONTRACTS WHICH WILL HELP SUPPORT OUR GOAL OF DEPLOYING UP TO THREE THOUSAND CLINICAL STAFF WITHIN WO TO THREE WEEKS TO VARIOUS TYPES OF HEALTHCARE FACILITIES. ADDITIONALLY WE CONTINUE OUR PREPAREDNESS AND READY NETWORK WITH THE HEALTHCARE. SYSTEM IN THESE MOMENTS IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR WE SENT OUT SURVEYS TO A PORTION OF FACILITIES AND THOSE WHO UTILIZE OUR STAFF TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN BETTER ADAPT OUR- AND WE CONTINUE TO DO THAT WE COLLECT RESPONSES HAVE CONVERSATIONS. IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE GENERAL EFFECTIVENESS IN UTILIZATION OF THE STAFF. WITH THIS I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. NOW WITH THE- DEPUTY DIRECTOR HELD IS OFTEN. HI THIS IS A MUCH BETTER GET A CHICKEN CAN YOU HEAR ME IN SENIOR OKAY. EIGHT THANK YOU I. N. GOOD MORNING MS CHAIR MISTER VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY ON ON- ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S. OFFICE EMERGED. OUR FIRST EMERGENCY SERVICES ROLE IN IMPLEMENTING THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN- CALAVERAS IS BEEN PART OF A LARGER TASK FORCE AND WE- IN SUPPORTING THIS PLAN AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO- THOSE MEMBERS INCLUDING G. S. C. D. PH. MILITARY MS- THEME ON. OTHER PHONE PARTNERS THAT WORK WITH US IN SOME- AS A KNOWS THE- YOUR IN CALIFORNIA THE NAY THE NATION THE WORLD DEALT WITH EXTREME BP DAYS OF THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC AND AS WITH ANY CRISIS. IN CERTAIN CERTAINLY- WITH THE CODEPENDENT MAKE WE HAD TO BE PURPOSEFUL AND TIMELY AND ACT ACCORDINGLY HAVE CONTINGENCY IS IN PLACE. AND GIVEN THE SIZE. OF CALIFORNIA AND ITS PPM MEDICAL NEEDS FOR HEALTHCARE AND IT'S WORKERS FIRST RESPONDERS AND OTHER SERVICES- WE DEVELOPED A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH AND IT WAS A SUSTAINABLE STRATEGIES AT TO MEET RESOURCE NEEDS. FOR THE DURATION OF THIS EVENT AND FOR THE FUTURE- OF THIS MULTI PRONGED APPROACH- TO SECURE PP AND SUPPLIES INCLUDED PURCHASING OUT FROM STOCKS AND SUPPLIERS. AND DONATIONS- STATE AND FEDERAL STOCKPILES LEVERAGING- NGOS ANOTHER COMMUNITY WORK. SELL GOVERNMENT APPROACH AND- AND THIS WORKED VERY EFFECTIVELY. OWNS COURSE THE KEY THING IS THAT WE'VE LEARNED THROUGH THESE EXPERIENCES WE CAN'T GO BACK THE WAY THINGS WERE PRIOR TO PANDEMIC. THE MEDICAL PUBLIC HEALTH ENVIRONMENTS HAVE BEEN PROPERLY CHANGE AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE THE EFFORTS TO PROPERLY PREPARE AND RESPOND. TO FUTURE REQUIREMENTS. THESE EFFORTS ARE ONGOING UNDER WHAT WE CALL THE READING THIS PORTION OF THE GOVERNOR SMARTER PLAN- BUT IT WAS NOT EASILY. EASY INITIALLY BUILDING THE FOUNDATION FOR SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. THE CONTINUES TO REQUIRE THE COORDINATED EFFORT AMONG MULTI AGENCIES AND PARTNERSHIPS THAT WE HAVE ESTABLISH INCLUDING- NOT PREVIOUSLY LISTED- OUR TRIBAL PARTNERS- THIS WORKERS LEFT IS FINALLY NOW WITH THE SUSTAINABLE AND RELIABLE LOGISTICS. PIPELINE THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE USED IN THE FUTURE. RAPID DEPLOYMENT OF PP AND MEDICAL SUPPLIES IS CRITICAL THE HEALTH SECTOR CRITICAL THE FIRST RESPONDERS AND CRITICAL FRONTLINE WORKERS WHEN COMMUNITIES ARE NEED. AND OTHER FOR HEALTH CARE- HAS HAD BEEN IT CAN. TO BE DISTRIBUTED- HER OUR PREPAY AND THEN PROCESS AND HEALTH CARE FACILITIES CONTINUE SMITH- RESEARCH RICK TO. THEY GO TO THEIR THROUGH THEIR NOW. HEALTH AREA COORDINATORS AND IF THEY SOURCES BECOMES UP TO THE STATE AND WE ELEVATED ACCORDINGLY AND THEN. AND THEN SUPPORT THEM BACK SO. WE'VE CREATED A SYSTEM THAT IS TIMELY THREES. AND REALLY SUPPORTS OUR STAKEHOLDERS- A COUPLE EXAMPLES THAT TOOK PLACE FIRST ON THAT WHERE'S OTHER MOST RECENT SPORT WAS WITHOUT THEIR BOARD OF EDUCATION AND THE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION A DIFFERENT LAW SCHOOLS OF PP AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FALL TWENTY TWENTY SCHOOLS OR- WE DID THIS IN COORDINATION AND PUSH THAT OUT RAPIDLY. WE'VE ALSO DONE IT WITH THE DEPARTMENT FOOD AGRICULTURE TO SERVE ACT FOR WORKERS IN CENTRAL ALONG THE COAST. AND WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE DIVISION OF OUR SAFETY. HEALTH AND THE CALIFORNIA OF PUBLIC HEALTH- ON STRIDES THAT ARE WORK. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN SUPPORT ACCORDING- ALL. ESTABLISH PROCESS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE IN THE FUTURE UNDER GOVERNOR SMARTER PLAN. OUR STATE OUR CENTER BEEN ACT NOW OVER HUNDRED. RISK TO THE GRAND. AND THE EFFECTIVE JUST OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT- CONTINUES AND IS IT IS SUCH A CRITICAL MISSION. FOR A TO SERVE- SINCE OF THE PANDEMIC WE'VE- A TOTAL. OF OVER ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION PIECES OF PP AND RELATE RE- TO COMBATING SPREAD OF CODE NINETEEN- IN TWENTY TWENTY TO- WE'VE ALREADY SHOULD BE MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE MILLION. HE SAYS- ARE FORTUNATELY OUR NUMBERS CONTINUE TO GO OUR REQUEST CONTINUE GO DOWN AND THIS IS A GOOD SIGN OF THE RESILIENCY THAT'S BEEN BUILT AT ALL LEVELS- THROUGHOUT. OUR HEALTH COMMUNITY I WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER. ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU MADE FOR THE PRESENTATION THAT WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I DO HAVE JUST A TWO QUICK QUESTIONS TO ASK ANYBODY MAYBE ON THE ON THE- SECOND PANEL- HOW'S THE STATE MEASURING. SUCCESSES AND PROVIDE IN ECUADOR SPONSOR- THROUGH THE SMARTER PLAN IN IN OUR- COUNTIES AND MEASURE THAT. AND HOW WE'RE LOOKING TO MAKE IT. MORE EQUITABLE ACROSS THE BOARD. HI THIS IS DOCTOR ARE GONE SO THAT THE KEY WHERE THEY WERE THE THIS IS. THERE'S TWO TWO MAJOR WAYS WERE DOING THE THINGS. ARE USING WITH A HEALTHY PLACES INDEX THAT COMPARES. DIFFERENT AREAS ACROSS THE NIGHT I'M SORRY ACROSS CALIFORNIA BASED ON- THE RESOURCES MOSTLY IF IT HASN'T HIGHER INCOME AND LOW INCOME. AND SO WE HAVE WE HAVE FOUND THAT. THAT WHAT WILL WHAT PEOPLE REFER TO AS HPI HPI ONE IS THE LOWEST INCOME H. P. I. TWO IS THE NEXT LOWEST INCOME. H. P. I. FOUR IS THE HIGHEST INCOME. WE FOUND DURING THE PANDEMIC THAT THESE THAT THESE CATEGORIES WERE THAT WERE AMONG THE STRONGEST PREDICTORS OF THE COVE IT. A CASE OF THE HOSPITALIZATIONS WE ALSO KNOW THAT IT ALSO CORRELATES WITH THE RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISTRIBUTION OF COMMUNITIES. CALIFORNIA SO WE'VE BEEN WITH TERM OF DISTRIBUTING. DURING OUR CAMPAIGNS- IN MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE SITES WE REALLY FOCUS ON CLOSING THE GAPS BECAUSE IT WE DID OBSERVE. THAT H. P. I. FOR WAS MORE SUCCESSFUL IN. AND HAVING HIGH COVERAGE AND THEN WE INVEST A LOT OF RESOURCES IN THOSE LOWER INCOME AREAS H. B. R. ONE INTO TWO. THAT EQUITY CAP. THE OTHER WAY THAT WE FOCUS ON THAT WE ALSO LOOK AT THE DATA- BY RACE ETHNICITY. AND WE'VE WORKED WITH OVER TWO HUNDRED- CBO'S ACROSS THE STATE TO REALLY GET THE MESSAGE OUT. ON A LOT HAS BEEN INVESTED IN THE IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH CAMPAIGN TO GET FOLKS VACCINATED FIGHTING- A MIS AND DISINFORMATION HAS BEEN AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT. THE LAST SECTION I WANT TO ALSO MENTION WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR EQUITY IS. IS WORKING WITH SCHOOLS ACROSS THE STATE ESPECIALLY THE PUBLIC PUBLIC SCHOOLS. MAKING SURE THEY WERE ABLE TO GET KIDS IN SCHOOL AND MAKE IT A SAFE POSSIBLE BECAUSE FAMILIES WANT TO SEND THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL IF THEY FEEL THAT. THEIR KIDS ARE GOING TO BE SAFE IN SCHOOL. THAT'S BEEN AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT EQUITY PERSPECTIVE FROM A MENTAL. HEALTH PERSPECTIVE FROM ALERTING LOS FIRST INTO FROM AN- PER. IN SUPPORT THESE CAN. THANK YOU AND THE NEXT PERSON HAD REALLY AND MAYBE LET YOU HAVE CONTROL OVER IT BUT- JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP DO WE HAVE A PLAN TO MAINTAIN EXISTING FROM LIKE WORK WORK FORCE FOR FUTURE COVERT- NINETEEN OUTBREAKS OR PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS HOW DO WE LOOK TO MEASURE THAT TO MAINTAIN- THE WORK FORCE. WELL I THINK THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I THINK AS YOU KNOW NOT JUST HERE IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS A STRUGGLE GLOBALLY AS WE TRY TO. MAINTAIN THIS WORKFORCE THEIR BURNOUT AND ALL THESEOTHER THINGS OBVIOUSLY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET WE HAVE. DIFFERENT WORKFORCE INITIATIVES WITH IN PARTNERSHIP WITH L. W. D. A. AS WELL AS- WORKING TO UNDERSTAND AND PARTNER WITH ORGANIZATIONS LIKE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL. TO TRY TO ADDRESS THESE NEEDS BUT I THINK. THIS WILL TAKE A LONGER TERM- IF VISION THAT REALLY SEEKS TO BUILD A PIPELINE OF THE WORK FORCE OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. OKAY THANK YOU- VICE CERTAINLY OF. HI COUPLE QUESTIONS HERE- SO THE- LET'S TALK ABOUT DISTRIBUTION OF THE PP WALK WHERE DOES IT DO WE HAVE A CENTRAL WAREHOUSE IN CALIFORNIA IS IT UP TO THE COUNTIES TO HAVE DISTRIBUTION. I MEAN SUPPLY WAREHOUSES THAT- PP E. CAN BE DISTRIBUTOR FROM WHEN WE DO HAVE SURGES IN HOSPITALS- RUN BEHIND IN BEING ABLE TO ORDER- FROM VARIOUS WHOEVER THEY ORDER FROM TO GET THEIR PP. ALEX GREAT QUESTION- SO- AT. STATE LEVEL WE MAY TO WHERE I- AND CONJUNCTION ARE PRIMARY SOURCE OF P. ONE IS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND ONE IS IN NORTH CALIFORNIA- AND BOTH OF THOSE LOCATIONS- SO. AND PUSH TP A DOWN. THE REGION OR THE COUNTY MORLOCKS- AS REQUESTED FOR THEIR SUPPLIES NOW WE KEEP THEM STOCKED AT A LEVEL THAT THEY'RE COMFORTABLE WITH AND THEY SET THOSE TARGETS- AND WE ALSO SUPPORT DIRECTLY TO OUR EASTER AND CUSTOMERS AS WELL SO. WE DO KIND OF A FULL STOP- SHOP WELL SUPPORTING EVERYBODY THERE- THIS WAY WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT- THE LOCAL OUR LOCAL PARTNERS ARE ADEQUATELY STOCKED IN RESOURCE TO BE WHEN THERE'S EVENTS THAT ARE BEYOND. THEIR CURRENT STOCKPILES THAT THEY HAVE. BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN I THE REALLY THINGS IS TO ENSURE THAT AS THEIR NEEDS FLUCTUATE AND CHANGE- THERE IS AN IMMEDIATE SOURCE OF- OF- I HAVE TO GET TO ACQUIRE THEIR PP FROM. AND AS YEAR. I THINK HAVING A NORTH AND THE SOUTH IS GREAT IF THE COUNTIES ARE INVOLVED IN HAVE THEIR OWN- SO THAT WE HAVE SOME CHECK AND BALANCES BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO ENSURE. THAT THOSE SOME THAT ARE WAY. ARE BEING. OUT AT A KIND OF HAS A END DATE TO IT AND- YOU DON'T WANT TO. A P. P. E. THAT IS A OR YEARS THE SHELF TIMES THAT THAT TYPE OF THING HOW DO YOU GUYS ENSURE THAT THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN. I WE ARE WINNING. IT'S A GREAT CAR. BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS A LIFE CYCLE AND SO- WE ARE VERY CLOSELY- THROUGH LIFE MANAGEMENT TO TRY TO- MAXIMIZE- THE DISTRIBUTION OF THOSE RESTORE. MAKE A- AS A TO THE END OF THEIR DATE- AND THEN PUSH THEM INTO. FOR OUR REPURPOSE THEM INTO OTHER AREAS- WHICH WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO USE- SUCH AS A BASED BASE COVERING. AFTER IT'S NO LONGER ABLE TO BE USED IN SURGICAL SETTING UP- THAT TOO WE WOULD USE FOR OUR MAY. COMMUNITY SO WE HAVE TO CLOSELY MONITOR- EXPIRING. AND LOOK AT THOSE DATES- AND THEN- ALL- TO DO OUR BEST TO. NOT HAVE TO NEXT AND FIND THE RIGHT TARGET. TO MAKE SURE THAT- AS A SHOCK ABSORBER- WITHIN THE SYSTEM NETWORK. ON THE LAST STICKING NATURE IN THAT WERE RESPONDING. AND NOT RUNNING SHORT AND NOT HAVING TOO MUCH SO IT'S A- ONE WE ARE. ABOUT HOW TO MAINTAIN- YOU KNOW CLOSE. OF AWARENESS OF. THE FUTURE PANDEMICS. THE RIGHT TARGET WHAT'S BEEN PREVIOUSLY USED- AND IT AND THERE THE SAME TIME. I WILL SAY HOSPITALS NOW INCREASE THEIR STORAGE. THE REGION'S OF AGREE SIR STORAGE THE CALORIES INCREASE OR STORAGE ALL OF THAT EVERYBODY IS. RESPONDED SINCE- TWENTY TWENTY SO THERE'S A- MUCH BETTER- STOCKPILE OF SITUATIONAL AND SO WE JUST MOVE FASTER NOW THAT WE HAVE- AND HAVE IN THE PAST AND IT'S JUST INCUMBENT ON US TO. MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T REGRESS- JANE. THAT KEEP THE BILL THE FUTURE FOR. THE FUTURE EVENTS ARE TYPE. RIGHT I THINK THAT BUT SUBJECT IN ITSELF IS SOMETHING THAT WE COULD PROBABLY HAVE A- BETTER DISCUSSION ON HOW TO HANDLE GOING INTO THE FUTURE BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE SOME WAYS OF. CHANGING THE WAY WE DO THINGS TO BETTER MANAGE THIS THIS. THIS TYPE OF SURGE THAT WE GET NOW- AND GOING INTO THE FUTURE BECAUSE OF- OF COVERT I WANT TO SWITCH TO REALLY QUICK. OF FACILITIES- RIGHT NOW THE SEARCH FOR HOSPITALS IS HANDLE. SOMETIME THE TENTS. OF SOMETIMES WITH DELAYING PATIENT TREATMENT FOR- WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE CONSIDERED TO BE ELECTIVE SURGERIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND IT REALLY DISRUPTS THE MEDICAL CARE FOR EVERYONE ELSE. AND I THINK. THE STATE HAS TO TAKE A ROLE IN FIGURING OUT GOING INTO THE FUTURE HOW WE'RE GOING TO HANDLE SURGE ON A PERMANENT. BASIS. BYE BYE MAYBE EVEN PART. AND HAVE HOSP CAMP. THAT HAVE. A B. MS IS ONE ONE PERSON WAS SPEAKERS I THINK IT'S MISS BASSINET. SPOKE YOU KNOW THE- NG WELL WE TO A- TO SOME OF CAMPUS THAT CAN HANDLE. KOBE WHEN IT SIR. AND THE STAY WRIST OF. SHOULD BE TO ABLE TO GET THOSE TYPE OF FACILITIES BILL. SO THIS THE HOSPITAL'S FOLK ON WHAT THEY NEED TO DO WHICH IS TO GROW THEIR COME. NOT SEARCH COMPARE. FOR A- BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY GET SWITCHED INTO DOING THAT AND THE COMMUNITY GROWTH FALLS BEHIND AND THEN THEY BECOME INADEQUATE- EVEN FOR THEIR MOST BASIC SERVICES FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES. SO THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK WE SHOULD ALSO BE LOOKING AT GOING INTO THE FUTURE I DON'T KNOW IF THERE WAS A QUESTION IN THERE BUT- MORE OF A THOUGHT PROCESS. YEAH OKAY THEM WITH THAT I JUST HAD ONE LAST QUESTION JUST CAME TO MIND- WITH THE USE OF- OR I SHOULD SAY THE HOME TESTS BECOME MORE AVAILABLE FOR FOLKS PURCHASING A KEVIN AMOUNT HOME DOES THE SMARTER PLAN ACCOUNT FOR ANY POTENTIAL- TESTED COME POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE ON THAT I KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO FROM HOME AT DIFFERENT SO HOW DOES THAT ACCOUNT FOR WITH THE SMARTER PLAN YEAH THIS IS A VERY GOOD QUESTION- IT HAVING THE AVAILABILITY HOME TESTING IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY CAN BE USED FOR MULTIPLE PURPOSES IF YOU'VE BEEN EXPOSED IF YOU DEVELOP SYMPTOMS. YOU CAN TESTER SET YOU CAN TEST YOURSELF PRE EVENT BEFORE YOU GO VISIT- TECH TO BEFORE YOU GO HAVE A SOCIAL INDOOR GATHERING SO I THINK IMPORTANT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF CONTESTS OF COURSE IS THAT WHEN THEY TEST POSITIVE IT DOESN'T END UP IN OUR SURVEILLANCE. SO- BUT THE PEOPLE CAN STILL USE THAT POSITIVE TO GET TREATMENT THEY DO THAT- POSITIVE TEST THE IT IN THE WILL THEY WILL THEY WILL BE TO GET TREATMENT AT THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO THE- REALLY. PAULFOR ALL OF US BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HAVE YOU WANT TO START TREATMENT AS SOON AFTER YOU DEVELOP- OTHER SYMPTOMS ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE AT RISK SO THE OTHER THING I JUST WANT TO MENTION OF THE CHALLENGE WHICH IS BECAUSE OUR SURVEILLANCE. ARE BASED ON THE CASE COUNT THAT WE HAVE ARE BASED ON PRIMARILY THE PEOPLE PRIMARILY PCR TESTS THAT ARE IN OUR SYSTEM SO THE CURRENT CASE COUNTS CHEESE THAT WE'RE REPORTING ARE RIGHT NOW OVER TIME DOES UNDER ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF TRANSITION THAT'S HAPPENING AND SO THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT- OUR OUR GUIDANCE IS RECOGNIZING THAT WERE UNDER COUNTY THERE'S MORE TRANSMISSION HAPPENING THE COMMUNITY THANK YOU SEE FROM THE OFFICIAL COUNTS BECAUSE THAT ONLY THAT'S ONLY THE PEOPLE. THE PCR TEST ARE BEING. COUNTED OKAY THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR SURE. NO WAY. THE OWNER THANK POWER FROM POWER FOR YOUR TIME. AND GIVING US A QUICK UPDATE ON THE GOVERNOR SMARTER PLANT SO. OBVIOUSLY LOOKS LIKE WE'RE IN A BETTER POSITION OR MAYBE A COUPLE THINGS TO WORK ON MINOR LEAGUE BUT- FOR THE MOST PART I THINK- HE PLAN. IS DO WHAT IT'S INTENDED TO DO ESPECIALLY TO PROVIDE CARE SERVICE TREATMENT TO OUR FOLKS IN ALL OUR COUNTIES. SO AT THAT WE WILL GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT- DID ARE TIME CONSTRAINTS WILL. PUBLIC COME TO ONE MAN- WITHOUT CAN WE TO THE- OPERA. OPERATOR WE DID OPEN UP FOR. ON THE LINE. IS OR ANYBODY ON THE LINE THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK. THANK YOU LATER GENTLEMEN TO.

HANIF CAL IS THE CITIZENS DO NOT ONE THIS THANK YOU. I EIGHT. THANK YOU COMMITTEE CHAIR THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS- I'M NOT SURE IF THE SMARTER PLAN INVOLVES MANDATING ANY TREATMENT OR PURELY RECOMMENDATIONS BUT THIS REALLY CONCERNS ME AS A CONSTITUENT AND THAT'S OUR GOVERNOR IS AN ADVOCATE FOR CHOICE I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD USE- BUSINESSES AS LIKE TO CALL THE POLICE FOR THE STATE- BUSINESSES HAVE THE ABILITY TO ENFORCE MASS WITHOUT A STATE MASS MANDATE AND THEY CAN ALSO MAKE THEIR OWN PRIVATE POLICIES. THAT CAN RESULT IN TRESPASSING CHARGES FOR THOSE NOT WEARING THE MASK I'M I'M MORE CONCERNED THAT OUR CHILDREN ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO A SPEECH IMPEDIMENT RATHER THAN A VIRUS ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE A NINETY NINE POINT 995% CHANCE OF SURVIVING AND THAT MAKES ME QUESTION WHY WE NEED THE GOVERNMENT TO TELL US WHAT'S BAD AND I THINK IT CLEARLY HAD DON'T WORK AND THERE'S NO SENSE IN IT ESPECIALLY WHEN TWO WEEKS BECAME MONTHS AND THEN YEARS. AND I YOU GUYS ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN ANSWER WHETHER THE STATE WAS REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT PEOPLE STATE YOU'RE NOT- WHAT KEEPING PEOPLE SAFE WE ALSO MANAGED TO CLOSE DOWN AROUND 36% OF OUR BUSINESSES AND IT'S THE NUMBER THAT HARD YOU KNOW GAVE US FROM AGO. IT'S PROBABLY CLOSER. ARE YOU IMPOSING RESTRICTIONS ON CITIZENS THANK YOU.

THAT'S IN THE DOCUMENTS I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING FROM ANY OF THE PEOPLE THEY PROPOSED IT IS BEING THE BEST SOLUTION MOVING FORWARD AND HIGHLY EFFECTIVE. READ RIGHT THAT DATA THEY WERE NO HE CLINICAL TRIALS TO DETERMINE IF THE EXPERIMENTAL JOBS WERE SAFE FOR PREGNANT WOMEN. IT WAS EXCLUDED FROM ALL TRIALS INSTEAD THEY CAPTURED ON FORTY FOUR RAP RAP. BEFORE CLAIMING IT WAS SAFE THERE ARE A TOTAL OF NINE SITES REVEALED OF THE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT ONLY SIX POINT 6% OF THE SUBJECTS. ARE BEING PRESENTED FOR THE DATA SO THERE'S STILL A LOT TO LEARN. THE LIPID NANOPARTICLES WERE FOUND HAD DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE BODY IN THE LIVER OVER YOU CAN OTHER VITAL ORGANS. FORTY EIGHT HOURS POST INJECTION.

IT SEEMS THAT WHEN PEOPLE HAVE AN OPINION AS THE REASON THEY ARE DISCOUNTED AS- YOU DON'T KNOW WE KNOW BEST IT'S VERY RUDE TO HANG UP ON SOMEBODY WHEN EVERYBODY'S TRYING TO DIVIDE- TO COME UP WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S GOING ON THIS IS GOVERNMENT OVER REACH THROUGH AND THROUGH WE THE PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO SPEAK WE HAVE A RIGHT TO SAY THAT YOU GUYS JUST DON'T SEEM TO BE LISTENING THE FACTS ARE RIGHT BEFORE YOUR EYES BUT YOU CONTINUE TO WALK IN AND THIS.

IT ANOTHER THOUGHT EIGHT OF THE ISSUE. WHAT WE'RE HEARING IS ONLY ONE SIDE OF THE ISSUE THIS IS. THIS IS WHAT SUPPOSED TO BE OR THIS IS WHAT'S GOING ON BUT IT'S NOT THERE'S OTHER INFORMATION OUT THERE THAT THINK THAT ACT EXACT OPPOSITE NO ADVOCACY FOR NOW. NO REASON TO VACCINATE A FIVE YEAR OLD OR A ONE YEAR OLD I MEAN THOSE ARE THOSE ARE LITTLE CHILDREN AND THESE ARE. EXPERIMENTAL THAT MEANS THAT ARE HARMING OUR CHILDREN HARMING OUR PEOPLE. AND I'M ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT DO GO TO THE BOARD NINE THE BOARD MEETINGS AND I TAUGHT BECAUSE- I'M WORRIED ABOUT MY KIDS. AND I'M WORRIED ABOUT MY GRANDKIDS.

THANK YOU JUST CONFIRM THAT WAS THE LAST ONE OPERATOR. THAT'S CORRECT OKAY WITH THAT WILL GO TO IN PERSON CONTACT. THIS IS GONNA BE FINE OKAY THE REASON WHY WE HAVE THESE EXPERIMENTAL VACCINES IF YOU DON MASS POLICIES AND LESS TESTING IS BECAUSE WE WERE LED TO BELIEVE THERE WAS NO CURE FOR SARS THE A B. TWO. SOME SAY A BIO WEAPON THAT'S SIMPLY UNTRUE ONE EFFECTIVE AND INEXPENSIVE TREATMENT AS A HYDROXYL OR CREAM PROTOCOL ANOTHER ONE IS IVERMECTIN WHICH MIGHT BE EVEN SAFER BECAUSE THERE'S NO ANTIBIOTICS THESE ARE FACTS NOT FAKE NEWS NOR CONSPIRACY THEORIES YOU CAN CONTINUE TO CANCEL CENTER DISMISSED THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. LIKE AMERICA'S FRONTLINE DOCTORS HAVE BEEN POURING US TO LISTEN TO THEIR NUMEROUS SUCCESS STORIES BUT THAT'LL NEVER CHANGE THE TRUTH AND WHY WOULD THEY BE CENSORED WHY ARE PEOPLE ASKING THESE QUESTIONS THE TRUTH IS EVEN TWO YEARS LATER OUR FIRST WORLD HOSPITALS CONTINUE TO KILL OUR CITIZENS WITH BLATANT MEDICAL NEGLECT BY NOT PROVIDING ANY TREATMENT AT THE ONSET OF SYMPTOMS. LEADING TO ADMINISTERING DEADLY BUT DISAPPEAR AND THE VENTILATOR DEATH SENTENCE MY LITTLE SISTER SPENT THE ENTIRE MONTH OF JANUARY IN THE HOSPITAL SO FIRSTHAND I THOUGHT. DO I IT AT LAND THIS IS. TERRORISM AND ALL INVOLVED OR COMPLICIT IN CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY FOR ACTUALLY SINCERE IN THE SAVING LIVES NARRATIVE HOW ABOUT WE STARTED HEARING TO THE HIPPOCRATIC OATH OF DOING NO HARM. LET THE DOCTORS TREAT THEIR PATIENTS THE WAY THEY SEE FIT WITHOUT. FEAR OF PENELAS ATION AND PROVIDING TRUE INFORMED CONSENT WHERE WE TELL YOU THE SIDE EFFECTS BEFORE WE INJECT YOU WITH SOMETHING. AND MAYBE PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO VACCINATE THEIR CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY SAW ENOUGH TEENAGERS DROP DEAD WITH MYOCARDITIS. AND THEY KNOW THAT THEIR CHILDREN WILL SURVIVE THE VIRUS. BUT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SURVIVE THE ADVERSE EVENTS IN THIS. IT'S RIDICULOUS THIS IS ALL AVAILABLE THIS INFORMATION THAT'S CALLED THIS INFORMATION IS BEING HIDDEN IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT A LIE AND IT'S JUST OKAY MEMBER MADE RUNS ONE THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR THAT MAY I SPEAK I JUST WANNA SAY WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO THIS WHOLE PANDEMIC IT REALLY COMES DOWN THE GOVERNMENT OVER REACH WHEN IT COMES TO THE MANDATES. FOR TWO YEARS GAVIN NEWSOM HOW TO SAVE EMERGENCY HE CLAIMED AT TWELVE TWENTY FIVE AND A HALF MILLION CALIFORNIANS WILL BE AFFECTED RECOVERY WHEN IN REALITY WE HAVEN'T REACHED THAT AT ALL AND SO IT ALL COMES DOWN TO JUST THE MANDATE HI EVERYBODY HAS BEEN NO YOU GOT TO DO THIS YOU CAN GET JOBLESS YOU THE VACCINE AND THAT'S BEEN A PROBLEM SO NOW MORE PEOPLE ACTUALLY WORKING FROM HOME. BECAUSE THEY DON'T GO TO THE JOB AND GET THE VACCINES SO WE JUST WANT YOU GUYS TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S YOU GUYS WHO DO WORK FOR US WE THE PEOPLE A I HOPE THAT WE CAN FIND SOME COMMON GROUND ON THAT THAT'S THE WHOLE PROBLEM BEGIN BELIEE WHICH WANT TO VACCINE WE GET THEM BACK TO GET THE VACCINE WHEN WERE MASS WERE AMASSEDBUT DON'T TELL PEOPLE. THEY HAVE TO DO THIS OTHERWISE THEY CAN'T DO THAT AND THAT'S NOT RIGHT SURE THE BUSINESSES HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO IT IN THE PRIVATE COMPANY DO WHAT THEY WANT BY THE STATE TIMES STAFF ON THE BALLOT TO WHERE WE COULD NOT BE TELLING PEOPLE WHAT TO DO. SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARE IN CHARGE OF THE PEOPLE THE ONES THAT ELECTED YOU- THE BIG LEAD LIKE SHE THAT THE ONLY WAY THE INFORMATION IS OUT THERE EVERY OUT OF THE DOCKED PAL SHE ADMITTED THAT ARE DYING BUT HE SAYS BECAUSE OF THE ONE BUT IT'S STILL A IF I PEOPLE AT THE WHEN THEY GOT THIS. SO IT'S ALL ABOUT GOV OVER OF NEED NOT THAT ANYMORE JUST ALLOW FOLKS TO DO WHAT'S BEST FOR THEM WITHOUT A BE A MANDATED THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WE HAVE NEXT. YES SO FROM. I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU- TWO STORIES OF HARM NOT FROM COVERT BECAUSE FORTUNATELY COVERT FOR MOST AS A COLDER A BAD FLU. BUT HARM FROM. THE POLICIES SET FORTH IN CALIFORNIA. SO MY HUSBAND WORKS IN A HOSPITAL HE HAD TO GET THREE JOBS. ON THE THIRD ONE HE HAD AN ADVERSE REACTION HE HAS ATTENDED THIS FROM IT TO THIS DAY. IT'S NOT GOING AWAY IT'S PROBABLY PERMANENT. AND NO ONE'S TALKING ABOUT VACCINE INJURY THERE'S AN IT TOO THEY CAN GET MYOCARDITIS FOR THAT REASON AS WELL AS OTHER CONDITIONS AND FOR THAT REASON MY SON. DID NOT WANT TO GET THE JOB AND NOW HE'S FACING SERIOUS DISCRIMINATION NOT. AND THIS IS ALL BECAUSE OF A CALIFORNIA'S POLICIES YOU WOULD LIKE TO GO TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR UC OR OF CSU. BUT TO GO IN PERSON THEY REQUIRE. THE CALL THE JOB. UNLESS HE GETS A RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION WHICH IS NOT GUARANTEED BY ANY MEANS. SO WE NEED TO DO TWO THINGS STOP ALL MANDATES LOOK INTO VACCINE INJURY IT'S REAL AND THIRDLY. THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE VACCINE INJURED THEY DON'T GET ANY COMPENSATION BECAUSE THE VACCINE MAKERS HAVE LEGAL IMMUNITY. OKAY SO WHATEVER INJURY THEY SUFFERED THERE'S NOWHERE FOR THEM TO TURN THE SCIENCE OKAY. LOOK AT LAKE DATA FROM ISRAEL THAT SHOWS YOUNG ADULTS HAVE INCREASED RATES OF CARDIAC ARREST AFTER VACCINATION THIS IS NINETEEN TO FORTY YEAR OLD THAT SIGNIFICANTLY ELEVATED THEY DID THE STUDIES- YOU KNOW LOOK AT. LOOK AT THE WALL GREEN STATE IT SHOWS THAT VACCINATED TEST POSITIVE MORE FREQUENTLY FOR COVER THAN THE UNVACCINATED. DATA FROM ENGLAND SERVES CHILDREN WHO WERE VACCINATED ARE DYING AT A MUCH HIGHER RATE OVERALL THIS IS SO SIGNIFICANT OKAY LIKE MY SON HE'S SKINNY HE'S HEALTHY HE HAS NO CO MORBIDITIES HE HAS HE'S LREADY HAD COVERT HE HAS ZERO REASON TO GET VACCINATED. BECAUSE IT'S ALL DOWNSIDE AND NO PLUS SIDE SO WHY WHY WOULD ANY YOU SEE YOUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE MAKE HIM GET VACCINATED THIS IS CRIMINAL. PLEASE RECONSIDER WHAT YOU'RE DOING THANK YOU THANK YOU- ANYONE ELSE. HELLO EVERYBODY MY NAME'S CHURCH CASTING YEAH THIS IS MY FIRST TIME HERE I KNOW YOU SAID ONE MINUTE I REPRESENT SEIU LOCAL ONE THOUSAND AND ALL THE STATE WORKERS THAT'S A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE SO I'M ASKING CAN I PLEASE HAVE MORE THAN ONE MINUTE.
