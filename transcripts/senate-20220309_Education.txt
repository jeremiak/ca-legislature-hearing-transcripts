THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBER SARAH PROUD TO STAND AND PRESENT SB EIGHT FIVE ONE- CAL GRANT EQUITY AND COLLEGE ACCESS ACT- TODAY I'M- PRESENTING THIS. I THINK POSSIBILE- WHICH WILL PROVIDE CRITICAL IMPROVEMENTS TO THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS BILL IS SPONSORED BY THE ASSOCIATION OF INDEPENDENT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WHICH REPRESENT OVER EIGHTY INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT ACCREDITED COLLEGES. THROUGHOUT THE STATE INCLUDING MANY IN MY SECOND THROUGHOUT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S COLLECTIVELY THERE ARE MORE THAN A HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND UNDERGRADUATES PURSUING THEIR EDUCATION AT THESE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES INCLUDING OVER TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND CAL GRANT RECIPIENTS. WHO ARE PREDOMINANTLY STUDENTS OF COLOR AND THE FIRST IN THEIR FAMILY TO ATTEND COLLEGE MY FAMILY CAN RELATE TO THAT AS MY FATHER WAS THE FIRST IN OUR ITALIAN IMMIGRANT FAMILY. TO ATTEND COLLEGE AFTER WORLD WAR TWO ONE THREE I BILL OF RIGHTS AND IT CHANGED. OUR FAMILY SIGNIFICANTLY THE SUPPORT AND QUALITY OF EDUCATION THAT STUDENTS RECEIVE AT THESE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IS REMARKABLE. STUDENT TO FACULTY RELATE RATIO IS ELEVEN TO ONE GIVING STUDENTS DIRECT ACCESS TO THEIR PROFESSORS. AT THE LEGISLATURE IS PRIORITIZE COLLEGE ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY AND THERE'S NO BETTER WAY TO SUPPORT BOTH GOALS. AND PROVIDING DIRECT FINANCIAL AID SUPPORT THROUGH THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS WHICH MINIMIZES THE NEED TO WORK FOR TAKE OUT EXPENSIVE STUDENT LOANS WHILE IT IS UNDENIABLY THE MOST ROBUST A. PROGRAM IN THE- CALVET MUST BE IN IN INFO WAYS. SB EIGHT FIVE WHAT CAL GRANT AT INCOME ACCESS ACT WILL STRENGTHEN AND EXPAND THE STATE SUPPORT FOR LOW INCOME COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO CHOOSE TO ATTEND I SEE SEE USE. IT WILL EXPAND ELIGIBILITY FOR SUPPLEMENTAL CAL GRANT SUPPORT TO STUDENTS PARENTS AND FOSTER YOUTH AS WELL AS SIMPLIFYING THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS THE BILL WILL HELP PRODUCE AN EDUCATED WORKFORCE AND HELP CLOSE THE EQUITY GAP. IT WILL ALSO EXPAND CAL GRANT SUPPORT TO SEVERAL THOUSAND ADDITIONAL STUDENTS BY PROVIDING A MORE STABLE AWARD FOR EVERY STUDENT. IN SNAP OR MAY IN THE FUTURE I BELIEVE IN THE VALUE OF THESE ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS WHICH HAVE A GREAT RECORD OF GRADUATING STUDENTS IN A VERY. EFFICIENT FOR YOUR TIME FRAME WHICH AGAIN IS SOMETHING HELPS THE STUDENT GETTING WORKS TO GET EDUCATED AND HELPS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- THESE INSTITUTIONS PROVIDE IN A- MAZING SERVICE TO A BROAD SPECTRUM STUDENTS.

WAR GOOD MORNING HONORABLE CHARLIE THAT MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND STAFF MY NAME IS THAT WHAT ABOUT THE STATE OF IOWA AND I AM THE LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. WE ARE PLEASED TO SPONSOR SENATE BILL NINE THIRTEEN BY SENATOR HERTZBERG. FOR THE LAST TWO DECADES LOS ANGELES UNIFIED HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING A TREND O DECLINING STUDENT ENROLLMENT. MOSTLY DUE TO DECLINING BIRTH RATES HOUSING UNAFFORDABILITY AND MIGRATION OF RESIDENTS OUT OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY. IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SCHOOL YEAR ALONE. COMPARED TO LAST YEAR LOS ANGELES UNIFIED EXPERIENCE A LOSS OF TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND STUDENTS. OR 6% OF OUR TOTAL STUDENT POPULATION FALLING UNDER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND EIGHTY EIGHT AND WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO OPERATE UNDER THE EXISTING LAWS SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZE FOR LEDS WITH FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS ARE MORE. LOS ANGELES UNIFIED VIEWS THESE PROVISIONS OF SB NINE THIRTEEN S. TECHNICAL CHANGES BY LOWERING THE EIGHTY EIGHT THRESHOLD 230-010-0080 EIGHT. AND WILL ALLOW THE DISTRICT TO CONTINUE TO UTILIZE STATUTORY PROVISIONS PERTAINING TO THE GOVERNANCE AND OPERATIONS OF OUR SCHOOLS. OF WHICH WE HAVE BEEN OPERATING UNDER FOR DECADES. AT THE LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA AND THE SECOND LARGEST IN THE COUNTRY. THERE ARE COLONIES OF SCALE THAT JUSTIFY MAINTAINING CURRENT PROVISIONS FOR THESE REASONS THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IS SPONSORING SENATE BILL NINE THIRTEEN. ENERGIZED BY VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I BELIEVE MISTER MOLINA IS HERE FOR TECHNICAL QUESTIONS ONLY SO WE WILL GO TO FORTY TWO OH THREE IF THERE'S ANYONE IN SUPPORT. WHO WISHES TO SPEAK ON SB NINE THIRTEEN EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT PLEASE PROCEED.

THANK YOU CENTER PANTS AND A DOLLY. I JUST WANTED TO. DO SO THAT'S OF SEEMS LIKE A LOT. BUT THE NUMBER. FOR ONE YEAR- WAS TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND I THINK THAT USE. MENTIONED DUE TO THOSE TO THOSE STUDENTS. DID THEY GO TO DIFFERENT DISTRICTS OR TODAY- LEAVE OUR STATE OR DO YOU KNOW DO YOU HAVE ABILITY TO KNOW WHERE THEY WENT. OUR RECORDS INDICATE THAT DUE TO DECLINING BIRTH RATES UNAFFORDABILITY OF HOUSING. AND STUDENTS WHO ARE TRANSFERRING TO OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS OR OUT OF THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES ARE THE RATIONALE FOR THE DECLINE IN ENROLLMENT. FEE I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY DATA WHICH SHOWS BEYOND OUTSIDE THE COUNTY WHAT THIS CASE. THANK YOU SENATE DOLLY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE SEEING NONE OF CENTER PROJECT CLOSELY JUST VERY BRIEFLY YOU KNOW WE MAKE THESE ASSUMPTIONS IN THE LAW. WHEN THIS LAW WAS WRITTEN AT A FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND FOUR THOUSAND HUGE SCHOOL DISTRICT COMPARED TO THE ONE I THINK IT'S ONE THOUSAND EIGHT SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND- IN THE COUNTY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND NO ONE WOULD HAVE ASSUMED THAT COULD BE FOUR THOUSAND WAS THE NUMBER THAT WORKS SO YOU KNOW PICKING THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND IS THAT THE NUMBER SHOULD BE THREE FIFTY WE DON'T KNOW BUT THE IDEA IS TO GIVE ROOM WITHIN THE LAW. SO THAT THESE SPECIAL PROVISIONS ARE REALLY DEALING WITH GIGANTIC DISTRICTS AND AT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND IT'S STILL A JACKET THE DISTRICT WITH THAT AS FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU SAID HERTZBERG THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR PAM.

HI FOR THAT TO YOU SENATE BILL NINE OH EIGHT WHICH IS A MEASURE CREATED BY STUDENTS TO UP LIFT OTHER STUDENTS SPECIFICALLY SB. NINE OH EIGHT WILL INCREASE STUDENT REPRESENTATION. AT CALIFORNIA OF IT VICE. A THIRD PERSON YOUTH ADVISORY COMMITTEE. UNDER THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF THE STUDENT BOARD MEMBER ON THE CALIFORNIA BOARD OF EDUCATION. CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO NEARLY SIX MILLION STUDENTS AND ALL OF THEM HAVE DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES PERSPECTIVES THAT CAN IMPROVE OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. HOWEVER ONLY ONE STUDENTIS CURRENTLY REPRESENTING ALL SIX MILLION STUDENTS ON THE CALIFORNIA BOARD OF EDUCATION. AND THE ONE STUDENTS SIMPLY CANNOT ADEQUATELY REPRESENT ALL THE STUDENTS AND THEIR UNIQUE NEEDS. AND THAT'S WHY THE COMMISSION UNDERSTOOD THE STATE WAS UNDER THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT STUDENTS COME FROM EVERY REGION OF THE STATE TEN ARE SELECTED BASED ON THEIR PASSION EXPERIENCE. RATHER NO GRADES THIS WILL ALLOW THE COMMISSION TO SPEAK ON A ROCK BROAD RANGE OF ISSUES. AFFECTING THEM INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH GUN VIOLENCE PULLING IN OTHER TYPES OF ISSUES. NOW MORE THAN EVER IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE ELEVATE VOICES OF STUDENTS THROUGH SB NINE AWAIT SO WE CAN EMPOWER THEM TO SOLVE ISSUES MOST IMPORTANT THEM. JOINING ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT- CATHERINE CHU AND MEAN A LEAD OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF STUDENT COUNCILS. THANK YOU. VERY MUCH CENTER PAN ALL RIGHT WE WILL GO TO YOUR LEAD SUPPORT YOU EACH HAVE TWO MINUTES WE'LL START WITH CATHERINE SHU AND THEN MOVE ON TO MEAN THE LEE. AND HOW NICE THAT YOU'RE YOU COULDN'T TESTIFY RIGHT THERE FROM. THE MICROPHONE IT'S GREAT TO SEE PEOPLE HERE TESTIFYING IN PERSON. PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY THE MORNING CARE LEYVA AND SAID EDUCATION COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS KATHERINE SHOE AND I'M A SENIOR AT WESLEY HIGH SCHOOL IN THE CANAL VALLEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT I'M HERE TODAY REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF STUDENT COUNCILS AS OUR GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS POLICY DIRECTOR TO DEMONSTRATE OUR SUPPORT AND SPONSORING AS BEING ON A WAY. TO BRING FRUIT BRIEFLY REITERATE THE BILL SB NINE AWAIT TREATMENT A SENIOR ADVISER COMMISSION UNDER THE STATE'S YOU TO BOARD MEMBER ON THE CALIFORNIA BOARD OF EDUCATION THIS YOU DON'T REMEMBER POSITION WAS ESTABLISHED TO ALLOW STUDENTS TO HAVE A VOICE IN EDUCATION DECISIONS IT'S A GREAT WAY FOR NEEDS TO BE HEARD AT THE STATE LEVEL. HOWEVER CURRENTLY THIS ONE MEMBERS TASKED TO REPRESENT THE SIX POINT THREE MILLION STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA FROM WHAT THIS POSITION WAS FIRST ESTABLISHED TO OUR POPULATION NOW IT IS A HUGE TASK TO TRULY REPRESENT THE SHEER AMOUNT OF STUDENTS WITH NO FORMAL STRUCTURE IN PLACE TO BE ABLE TO HEAR THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THIS CAN LEAD TO THE MISREPRESENTATION OF STUDENTS AND OUR STATE. ESPECIALLY UNDERREPRESENTED WINDS. AND PAST MOST STATES BERMAN HAVE FROM. URBAN AREA LIKE THE AREA OR LOS ANGELES. VOICES FROM AREAS LIKE THE CENTRAL VALLEY HAVE NOT BEEN ADEQUATELY REPRESENTED. WHICH CAN SKEW THE ACCURACY OF WHAT THE STUDENT BOARD MEMBER SHARES WITH THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. LAST YEAR WHEN I WAS RUNNING FOR THIS YOU NUMBER MEMBER POSITION ALONGSIDE ELEVEN OTHER SEMI FINALISTS. WE UNANIMOUSLY AGREE THAT ISSUE NUMBER AS OUR COMMISSION IS ESSENTIAL. AFTER ALL MOST SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS AND STUDENT ADVISORY COUNCILS. SO IT WOULD ONLY MAKE SENSE OF THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION WHICH MAKES ASSERTIONS FOR MILLIONS OF STUDENTS WOULD HAVE ONE AS WELL. I A RESULT THE STUDENT ADVISORY COMMISSION PROPOSED IN THIS BILL WOULD BE COMPOSED OF STUDENTS FROM TWELVE REGIONS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THIS WOULD ALLOW FOR DIVERSE REPRESENTATION IN THE STRUCTURE THAT WE HOPE. COULD LAST FOR MANY YEARS. THESE PERSPECTIVES WILL BETTER INFORM THE STATE'S YOU KNOW BOARD MEMBER. AND UPDATES CAN BE RELATED TO THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION AS WELL. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN FOR EMPOWERING YOUNG PEOPLE AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE CONVERSATION AND UNDERSTANDING THE IMPORTANCE OF YOUTH. VOICES IN EDUCATION DECISIONS I THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME AND STRONGLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE FOR ON SB NINE AWAIT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MEENA LEAVE PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD MORNING AS THE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE MY NAME IS MERELY A CURRENT SENIOR AT JOHN MARSHALL HIGH SCHOOL IN LOS ANGELES I'M HERE TODAY I SEE SOME STATE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF STUDENT COUNCILS. TO DEMONSTRATE CAST SUPPORT FOR NETFLIX SB NINE AWAIT. I THINK STUDENT WHO GREW UP IN THE LARGEST DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA AND THE SECOND LARGEST IN THE NATION. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA HOT ONE THOUSAND AND THIRTY SEVEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS. I'M SURE YOU CAN IMAGINE MY SURPRISE WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT OTHER DISTRICTS FOUR AND A HALF YEARS AGO I TO CAST CONFERENCE. I ALSO DIDN'T KNOW THAT STUDENTS COULD BE THE DECISION MAKERS BY RUNNING FOR SB IMPOSITIONS IT WITHIN THEIR DISTRICT. AND ON A STATEWIDE LEVEL. THE IDEA THAT A FELLOW STUDENT WITH GETTING MY VOICE HEARD ON A PROBLEM LARGER THAN I EVER IMAGINED. MAYES THIRTEEN YEAR OLD YOU KNOW. QUESTION STARTED TO ARISE HOWEVER WHEN I HEARD THAT THERE WAS ONLY ONE STUDENT BOARD MEMBER. MAKING THESE DECISIONS ON THE BEHALF OF SIX POINT THREE MILLION CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS. HOW CAN A STUDENT FROM SAN DIEGO PROPERLY REPRESENTATIVE AND VOICE THE VASTLY DIFFERENT STRUGGLES THAT LEAVES THE STUDENTS FEES. EVERY STUDENT AND EVERY REGION DESERVES TO BE HEARD ON A STATEWIDE LEVEL AND THAT IS WHAT SB NINE AWAIT ACHIEVES. ACCORDING TO RESEARCH DONE BY UCLA THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY NINE THOUSAND STUDENTS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA TODAY. WHAT'S NEXT IN ITS MAKE UP 70% OF THIS COMP POPULATION ALL BLACK STUDENTS MAKE UP 9% A STARK CONTRAST IN COMPARISON TO TURNED AND ROLLED MATT NUMBERS. ANOTHER STUDY DONE BY UCLA SHOW THAT 10% OF STUDENTS PUBLICLY IDENTIFIED AS A PART OF THE LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY. HE'S A QUESTION AGAIN HOW CAN ONE STUDENT BOARD MEMBER. ADEQUATE REPRESENT THE DIVERSE AND GROWING SIX POINT THREE MILLION STUDENT POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA. IMPLEMENTING A ONLY ENSURE THAT STUDENTS FROM MULTIPLE REGIONS ARE REPRESENTED DIRECTLY ON A STATEWIDE LEVEL TO THE STATE STUDENT BOARD MEMBER. IT WIL ALSO SHOW OUR STUDENTS THAT THEIR VOICE MATTERS AND THAT THEIR VOICES ARE HEARD TO CREATE CHANGE TO MAKE SCHOOL SAFE PLACE A PLACE TO LOOK FOR TO GOING EVERYDAY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION THANK YOU MISLI. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO IN THE SUPPORT HERE IN FORTY TWO OH THREE ANYONE WHO WISHES TO STATE THEIR NAME AND SUPPORT FOR THE BILL MAY DO SO.

IS GREAT FOR THE LEADERSHIP SIDE THAT I CERTAINLY EXPERIENCED. FIVE LEGISLATION- THAT'S PENDING BEFORE THE SENATE HOPING TO HAVE IT COME I THINK TO THIS COMMITTEE. THAT WOULD ALLOW SCHOOL BOARDS THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A VOTING STUDENT MEMBER. VOTING STUDENT MEMBER ON THEIR BOARDS IF THEY SO CHOOSE TO TAKE THAT TAKE THAT POSITIVE STEP. ALSO THAT LEGISLATION THAT DID PASS THE SENATE THIS YEAR THAT WOULD ADD A SECOND VOTING STUDENT ON THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

AND CAPISTRANO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT SENATE DISTRICT THIRTY SIX AND ASSEMBLY DISTRICT SEVENTY THREE. I SERVE AS THE EDUCATION POLICY DIRECTOR IN THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF STUDENT COUNCILS AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE STUDENT ADVISORY BOARD ON LEGISLATION AND EDUCATION CONFERENCE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. ALSO THE MAJORITY OF EVERYDAY TASKS AND EVENTS THE COPING NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS FORCED US TO ADOPT. THIS YEAR'S CONFERENCE TO TAKE PLACE VIRTUALLY WITH EACH STUDENT CONNECTING FROM THEIR OWN HOMES. IT HAS BEEN AN ABSOLUTE HONOR WITNESSING THE GROWTH OF OUR FIFTY DELEGATES OVER THE COURSE OF THREE DAYS. THEIR PASSION FOR THEIR OWN EDUCATION THEIR WILLINGNESS TO BE FLEXIBLE AND THEIR DESIRE TO ACTIVELY WORK FOR CHANGE ARE SO EVIDENT. EVEN FROM A COMPUTER SCREEN. AS MANY STUDENTS NAVIGATE THE AFFECTS OF DISTANCE LEARNING LAST YEAR WE ARE INCREASINGLY RIDLEY REAR INCREASED CREASING REMINDED OF THE CRITICAL PERSPECTIVES OF THE STUDENT VOICE. WITH KOBE NINETEEN AND THIS TRANSITION AMPLIFYING THE FAULT IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. STUDENT FEEDBACK WITHIN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM HAS NEVER BEEN BEFORE OF GREATER CONSEQUENCE. THE SPEAKERS BEHIND OUR STRONG WILLED BRILLIANT AND PERCEPTIVE. THEIR DEDICATION INSPIRES NOT ONLY ME BUT THE STAFF BEHIND US. ARE FIFTY DELEGATES DEBATED VOTED AND DECIDED ON FIVE TOPICS THAT TRULY EMBODY WHAT THE DELEGATION USED TO BE AREAS OF CONCERN THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION SYSTEM. THESE INCLUDE SERUM VOICE MENTAL HEALTH ENVIRONMENTALISM POST HIGH SCHOOL PREPAREDNESS AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST SCHOOL SAFETY. OVER THE COURSE OF THREE DAYS THEY TOOK IT UPON THEMSELVES TO COMPRESS ALL OF OUR DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES IDEAS PASSIONS WANTS AND NEEDS INTO FIVE THOROUGH PROPOSALS. DELEGATES BOTH UNDERSTAND AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STATE AND LOCAL POLICY IDEAS AND HAVE KEPT THIS IN MIND WHEN BACK IN BRITAIN EVALUATING ALL POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS. I AM CONFIDENT THAT ARE THE STUDENT ADVISORY BOARD I'M LEGISLATION IN EDUCATION PRESENTS OUR SOLUTIONS WITHIN AND CONCERNING OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. THE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION WILL BE HEARING TE MOST PRESSING CONCERNS FOR THE BEST STUDENT REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA. OUR FIRST PRESENTATION WILL BE ON THE TOPIC OF STUDENT VOICE PRESENTED BY AMERICAN THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS TO MS MERRY KIM WELCOME PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MERRY KIM AND I'M A CURRENT SOPHOMORE AT VERY HIGH SCHOOL IN FULLERTON CALIFORNIA AND ASSEMBLY DISTRICT SIXTY FIVE AND SENATE DISTRICT TWENTY NINE. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE STUDENT ADVISORY BOARD ON LEGISLATION AND EDUCATION TO DISCUSS THE LACK OF STUDENT VOICE IN EDUCATIONAL MATTERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. AS A RESULT OF INACCESSIBLE RESOURCES REGARDING KNOWLEDGE ABOUT OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. WITHOUT THIS FOUNDATIONAL INFORMATION MANY STUDENTS ARE LEFT UNINFORMED AND DISENGAGED FROM THE EDUCATIONAL GOVERNING BODIES RESULTING IN THE ABSENCE OF STUDENT VOICE AND RELEVANT DECISIONS. PLUS WE PROPOSE THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS DISTRIBUTE BI MONTHLY NEWSLETTERS. TO ALL EDUCATION PARTNERS SPECIFICALLY TARGETING STUDENTS CONTAINING THIS INFORMATION IN PLAIN LANGUAGE. THESE NEWSLETTERS WILL RAISE STUDENTS AWARENESS OF THE EDUCATION SYSTEM INFORM THEM OF EXISTING OPPORTUNITIES AND PRESENT AVENUES FOR THEM TO PARTICIPATE AND MAKE VALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS. TO ENSURE THAT STUDENT VOICE IS RIGHTFULLY REPRESENTED IN EDUCATION RESOURCES SUCH AS STUDENT BOARD MEMBERS PUBLIC DOCUMENTATION OF THE EL CAP AND PUBLIC BOARD MEETINGS AND DISTRICT LEADERS ARE AVAILABLE FOR YOU TO EXPLORE. BUT STUDENTS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE UNDER REPRESENTED ARE UNEQUIPPED TO UNDERSTAND THIS INFORMATION. CONSEQUENTLY THEY CANNOT EXPRESS THEIR STUDENT VOICES. FURTHER DIRECT COMMUNICATION THAT DOES EXIST IS BETWEEN DISTRICT PARENTS WITH THE FLOOD ASSUMPTION THAT PARENTS WILL INFORM THEIR STUDENTS. I FOR ONE IN FOURTEEN DISTRICTS HAVE NO WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH MY BOARD MEMBER. I KNOW SHE SAYS YEAH I'VE NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH HER TO SHARE MY OPINIONS OR TO DISCUSS WHAT EVENTS ARE GOING ON IN OUR DISTRICT. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT EVENTS WERE BEING DISCUSSED OR HOW THEY'RE BEING DECIDED. I SIMPLY DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO LOOK. SINCE LIKE ME COULD NOT MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS COMPETENTLY PERCENT OUR IDEAS BECAUSE OF A LACK OF THIS CRUCIAL KNOWLEDGE. BY CHANCE I FOUND ABOUT SABLE CASKET AND THE WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY PROVIDE. AND SINCE THEN I REALIZE HOW I CAN USE MY VOICE AS A STUDENTS TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. AFTER GETTING MORE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT MY DISTRICT AND EDUCATION SYSTEM I STARTED TO SEE MY SCHOOL FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE. HOWEVER I KNOW THAT MOST OF MY PEERS CANNOT SEE THE SAME. RESEARCH CONDUCTED BY THE QUADRI INSTITUTE FOR SCHOOL VOICE AND ASPIRATIONS INDICATE THAT STUDENTS WHO DO BELIEVE THEY HAVE A VOICE ARE SEVEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE ACADEMICALLY MOTIVATED. STUDENTS WHO DO NOT BELIEVE THEY HAVE A VOICE. SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO GIVE STUDENTS THE SPACE TO USE THEIR VOICES BY QUIPPING THEM WITH THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO COMPREHEND COMPLEX ISSUES FACING THEIR EDUCATION. AS SUCH OUR PROPOSAL IS TO HAVE DISTRICTS DISTRIBUTE BI MONTHLY NEWSLETTERS CONTAINING THESE RESOURCES AS WELL AS CURRENT INFORMATION ABOUT THE BOARD OF THE KING OF EDUCATION MEETINGS TO STUDENTS AS WELL AS THEIR FAMILIES AND ALL OTHER RELEVANT EDUCATION PARTNERS. THESE NEWSLETTERS WILL CONTAIN THREE SECTIONS WITH THE INTENTION OF PREPARING STUDENTS. WITH THE TOOLS TO UTILIZE THEIR VOICE. SECTION ONE WILL BE A DEBRIEF OF THE MOST RECENT BOARD MEETING WRITTEN IN SIMPLE TERMS BY THE COMMUNICATION DEPARTMENT FOR MINUTES WRITTEN BY BOARD CLERK. SECTION TWO WILL PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENTS AS AN AVENUE FOR STUDENTS TO SHARE OPINIONS AND ASK QUESTIONS AND PROVIDING THEM DIRECT AVENUE TO THEIR BOARD STUDENT BOARD MEMBERS IF APPLICABLE AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT GOVERNING BODIES. SECTION THREE WILL BE A LINKUP TO EXISTING BOARD WEBSITES WITH INFORMATION ABOUT STUDENT INVOLVEMENT OPPORTUNITIES SUCH AS HOW TO SERVE ON DISTRICT COMMITTEES COMMITTEES A GUIDE TO UNDERSTANDING THE L. CAP. AND LINKS TO OTHER FOUNDATIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE EDUCATION SYSTEM. BY CONSISTENTLY INFORMING STUDENTS WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THEY NEED TO ENGAGE IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM WE FULLY AND EQUITABLY ENABLE STUDENT VOICES TO BE HEARD. TO GIVE STUDENTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE THEIR VOICES AT AS A CATALYST FOR CHANGE. WEATHER BEATER SPEAKING AT DISTRICT COMMITTEE MEETINGS REACHING OUT TO THEIR STUDENT BOARD MEMBERS OR EVEN JUST LEARNING THE INS AND OUTS OF THE ELK. KNOWLEDGE PROCEEDS EXPRESSION WHICH IS WHY IT IS SO CRUCIAL THE ACCURATE ACCESSIBLE INFORMATION IS PROVIDED DIRECTLY TO STUDENTS. WE HELP TO UPLIFT STUDENTS FROM ALL OVER CALIFORNIA TO BECOME ACTIVE INFORMED INFLUENCERS AND MASTERS OF OUR OWN DESTINY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU MISS KIM THAT WAS AN EXCELLENT PRESENTATION AND A BRING IT BACK TO THE MEMBERS OF THE BOARD MISTER CHAIR DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- BUT YEAH JUST VERY VERY WELL DONE YOUR PRESENTATION VERY WELL DONE. AND THIS DOCUMENT HERE IS VERY WELL KNOWN AS WELL I DON'T KNOW THAT I'VE SEEN THIS IN PREVIOUS YEARS MAYBE I HAVE IT DIDN'T TAKE NOTICE BUT THIS IS A VERY WELL PUT TOGETHER AND KIND OF A LEGISLATIVE ASK. FASHION SO- VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT AND- YEAH I ALSO APPRECIATE I CAN TELL YOU AND WHAT YOU ALWAYS HEAR ME TALK ABOUT IS- IN PAST YEARS AND IS THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH BILLS AND IT'S A VERY EVIDENT TO ME THAT IS THIS- THAT AS YOUR BILLS IN YOUR THOUGHTS WERE PUT TOGETHER YOU CONTEMPLATED. THE FISCAL ELEMENTS OF YOUR BILLS BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT- SOMETHING WE TALK ABOUT A LOT BECAUSE A LOT OF LEGISLATORS HAVE GREAT IDEAS A HUNDRED TWENTY LEGISLATORS UNDER RIGHT THEY ALL HAVE GREAT IDEAS AND THEIR IDEAS THE ONE IDEA THAT YOU KNOW WE NEED TO DO NOW BUT THE THING IS THOSE BILLS COST MONEY. AND THEY IMPOSE COSTS ON DISTRICTS WHICH I WOULD ARGUE ARE ALREADY UNDER FUNDED SO I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'VE CAUGHT CONTEMPLATED THE PRACTICALITY OF YOUR PROPOSALS THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR PROPOSALS BUT ALSO THAT YOU'RE HERE TODAY I'M A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER. OKAY I'VE BEEN ON LEAVE FROM HIGH SCHOOL FOR BODY EIGHT ALMOST EIGHT YEARS NOW BUT I'LL BE GOING BACK NEXT FALL- BUT I DO SOMETHING THE FALL IS BACK IN THE CLASSROOMS I UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON AT SCHOOL STRESSES RIGHT NO SIDES ALL THAT KIND OF THING YOU'VE SEEN IT YOURSELVES. SO I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE HERE TODAY AND HOW PROFESSIONAL YOU WILL APPEAR IN. YOUR PRESENTATIONS ARE. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR OF THE- AND I AGREE I DON'T READ. THIS YEARS. EITHER SO MAYBE I WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION. IT IS VERY WELL DONE- YOU'LL HAVE A BRIGHT FUTURE IN THE LEGISLATURE IF YOU SO CHOOSE TO GO THAT WAY. SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND- REALLY APPRECIATE THE THOUGHT- THE THOUGHTFULNESS. YES MY QUESTION TO YOU IS- NIGHT I'M NOT A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER I ACTUALLY. TIGHTENED IN HIGHER EDUCATION- SO THURSDAY NIGHT I HAVE A SON WHO'S IN HIGH SCHOOL- WE ACTUALLY GET A LOT OF INFORMATION RIGHT YOUR PHONE CALLS FROM THE SCHOOL DISTRICT FROM THE US FROM THE- PRINCIPLE YOU KNOW. BY THREE EMAILS AND SO FORTH- HOW DO YOU SEE THE NEWSLETTER AND- IN TERMS OF ENGAGING STUDENTS AT SCHOOL SO YOU TALK **** ABOUT YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT AND SAYING HEY I WANNA GET MORE INVOLVED IN ON A SURE HOW BUT I'M SURE AT THE SAME TIME WHEN YOU'RE IN SCHOOL YOU HAVE STUDENTS WHO ARE REALLY INTERESTED YES- STUDENTS WHO AREN'T AND- TO CERTAIN EXTENT OF COURSE ON STUDENTS WHO ARE WILLING TO SHARE THE INFORMATION. DO YOU DO YOU HOW DO YOU SEE SORT OF ENGAGING MORE STUDENTS- SO YOU CAN PUT INFORMATION FRONT OF PEOPLE BUT I THINK THERE'S ALSO THE ENGAGEMENT PARTY AS WELL THAT YOU DON'T THIS IS THIS IS ACTUALLY AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE CHANGE AND IS IT TO GET YOUR VOICE HEARD AND SO FORTH SO- CAN YOU JUST MAYBE ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT- YOU KNOW GIVEN YOUR EXPERIENCE HOW HOW DO WE ENGAGE MORE STUDENTS IN THIS DIALOGUE SO TO ONE ONE PROBLEM COULD BE IS THAT YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATORS AND THE LEADERS OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT JUST AREN'T AS AVAILABLE. BUT IF WE GOT THEM THERE YOU KNOW PARTY GOOD THANK YOU IS THERE A WAY WE CAN GET MORE STUDENTS EXCITED ABOUT THAT I MEAN IT IS THE FIRST LADY'S ABOUT CIVICS EDUCATION OVERALL ECONOMY WE CAN TALK ABOUT COMING TO THE STATE STAGES OF ANY SCHOOL DISTRICT AND SCHOOL BOARD IS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY RELEVANT I ONLY HOPE TO STUDENTS AND- WOULD HOPEFULLY APPRECIATE THAT AT LEAST A OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE WITH PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY HAVE A PRETTY DIRECT IMPACT. ON MONDAY ABOUT YOUR LIVES. YEAH I THINK THAT. A BIG. AT LEAST WHAT I SEE IN IN PIERCE AND- AROUND ME IS THAT WE A LOT OF. WE HAVE QUESTIONS. BUT NO ONE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS THOSE SO THEREFORE BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE A CHANGE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TRY TO MAKE A CHANGE BECAUSE- THERE'S NO RESOURCES OR OPPORTUNITIES PUT IN FRONT OF THEM. TO OOK INTO THE QUESTIONS TO GET ANSWERS FOR THE QUESTIONS. SO I THINK WHAT THIS PROPOSAL AT LEAST AS WE WERE GOING OVER THIS AT SABLE IS THAT- WE WANT TO HAVE A MORE DIRECT AVENUE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE SO MANY IDEAS. MAYBE WHO DON'T TALK ABOUT THEM ALL THE TIME WHO DON'T PURSUE ANSWERS. BECAUSE THERE ARE NO ANSWER CHOICES FOR THEM. I JUST THINK THAT THIS NEWSLETTER AND THESE OPPORTUNITIES TO TALK WITH STUDENT BOARD MEMBERS WHICH IS BE A STEP FOR STUDENTS. WHO WANT TO TAKE WHO WANT TO FIND OUT MORE IT'S AN EASY AVENUE FOR THEM. TO BE ABLE TO GET ANSWERS TO THOSE QUESTIONS. THAT'S GREAT AND I THINK THAT- INFORMATION IS OF COURSE THE FIRST STEP AND THEN CREATING SOME SPACES AT COLUMBIA SPACES IN THE SCHOOL FOR. SOME VEGETABLES YOU KNOW WE MAY HAVE AN IDEA BUT- THEY NEED SOME. COLLECTIVE THINKING RATE THAT IT HAD A PLACE TO SHARE IT MAYBE NOT NECESSARILY. DIRECTLY TO SUPERINTENDENT AND SCHOOL BOARD RIGHT AWAY BUT HEY LET ME TO TALK TO MY FRIENDS AND SO FORTH AND THEN. PEFORM THE IDEA. AND AND THAT YOU KNOW UP WITH AS AN EDUCATOR I DO APPRECIATE AND I AM LOOKING AT US AS- ASSEMBLY RODADA GOING.

AB USED BY SRI COMMITTEE WHICH ACTUALLY HAS A GROUP OF STUDENTS THAT APPLIED TO HAVE A VOICE WITHIN THE CITY COUNCIL- AND HAVE INPUT IN WHAT THE COMMUNITY THE CITY NEEDS. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS OR NEEDS FOR THE STUDENTS SO I'M AN ADVOCATE FOR OF AN ADVOCATE OF A YOUTH VOICES- IT WAS INTERESTING THAT YOU WOULD COME UP WITH THE IDEA OF A NEWSLETTER CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT MOST OF OUR YOUTH IS VERY TECHNOLOGICALLY ENGAGED. HOW DO YOU THINK TECHNOLOGY AND- SOCIAL MEDIA COULD ACTUALLY BE UTILIZED TO MAXIMIZE THE ENGAGEMENT AT THE INFORMATIVE PROCESS AND DID YOU TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION MAYBE IN UTILIZING THAT THOSE PLATFORMS TO INFORM AND ENGAGE- FELL STUDENTS. I BELIEVE THAT WHEN WE'RE DISCUSSING IT WE ARE SAYING THAT THESE NEWSLETTER LET LETTERS- COULD BE ALSO EMAILED OR ONLINE COPIES WHICH I BELIEVE COULD BE UTILIZED BECAUSE I KNOW THAT A LOT OF STUDENTS DON'T CHECK THEIR EMAILS BECAUSE SO MANY COME IN. THE SUN IS ONE OF A- YEAH DE. BUT THE ADVERTISE THESE ON SOCIAL. PLATFORMS LIKE YOUR SCHOOL A SPECIES INSTANT INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT OR THINGS LIKE THAT I'M JUST QUICK INFORMATION WHERE PEOPLE CAN JUST SEE- THIS IS A LINK THAT I NEED THAT I CAN USE. TO FIND OUT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT STUDENT BOARD MEETINGS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT INFORMATION- THERE ARE SO MANY OF RESOURCES TO GET INVOLVED BUT THE PROBLEM IS JUST THE BRIDGE TO BE ABLE TO GET THERE. STUDENTS WHO ARE INTERESTED ARE ABLE TO JUST- THE SCOPE SCOLDED THIS AND CLICK ON IT AND SEE. WHERE THEY CAN GET INVOLVED SO YEAH I THINK SOCIAL MEDIA IS. HUGE WAY THAT. A LOT OF STUDENTS HAVE IT SAID BE A REALLY GOOD WAY FOR STUDENTS TO GET INVOLVED. OVERLY ACCESSIBLE I THINK USE AND ALSO VERY INEXPENSIVE WAY OF REACHING OUT TO THEIR TO THE STUDENTS ARE RICHEST- WHY DO FOLKS ARE CONSIDERING I JUST DIDN'T SEE IT DIDN'T WITH A NEWSPAPER. SOMETHING PRINTED I THOUGHT. OH THAT'S MORE FOR OLDER PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF. BUT I WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE YOU THEY ALWAYS THINK ABOUT. THEIR THEIR INTEREST IN OR- YEAH THERE INTEREST IN ENGAGEMENT SESSION WE AND JUST MAKING SURE THAT YOU'RE- USING THAT MAXIMIZING. THOSE OPPORTUNITIES THOSE PLATFORMS AS WELL THAT GREAT JOB. THANK YOU SERRA CHAU BOGUE THANK YOU MS KIM. ALL RIGHT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO OUR NEXT PRESENTER MODEL WHO HAS GOT TO MCCULLOUGH PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I WAS TERRIBLE AT THAT COME RIGHT UP AND I THINK YOU'RE A STUDENT LOS ALSO AS HIGH SCHOOL WHICH IS JUST A LITTLE BIT OUT OF MY DISTRICT BUT I THINK IT MIGHT BE YES SENATOR TO OPPOSE DISTRICT. SO WELCOME PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD MORNING S. C. MEMBERS OF THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MADHU S. KILEY MCCOLLUM ONE FORTY FIRST SENATE DISTRICT AND TWENTY THIRD ST DISTRICT AND I AM A JUNIOR AT LOS HIGH SCHOOL AND SAMBAR DINO COUNTY. ON BEHALF OF THE STUDENT BY THE BOARD ON LEGISLATION EDUCATION. WE PROPOSE THAT EACH SCHOOL REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH A WELLNESS ADVISOR GROUP. IT'S PRESENTED A PETITION SIGNED BY MINIMUM FIVE AND STUDENTS. ARE A MINIMUM OF 10% A NUMBER OF STUDENTS ENROLLED HIGH SCHOOL TO DISTRICT. ATTENDING A SCHOOL WITH OVER THREE THOUSAND STUDENTS AND BEGIN CLASSES RELEASED THIRTY CLASSMATES. MENTORS KANSI SURROUNDED BY FRIENDS AND PEERS. I NATURALL FELT A SENSE OF CLOSENESS AND COMMUNITY. WITHIN THESE ENSELY POPULATED PEER GROUPS HOWEVER. AFTER CO NINETEENTH SENATE THE CENTER COMMUNITY WAS COMPLETELY DESTROYED. I FIRST EXPERIENCED NEGATIVE FACTS A LOCKDOWN SIX MONTHS MY FRESHMAN YEAR. OVERWHELMED WITH NO LOG OF WHERE ARE WHO MARKETS OUT TOO. OFTEN CAN STAND TO GET OUT OF BED BECAUSE OF STRESS AND SONYA AND IF TAKE. I FELT THE DAYS PLAYING TOGETHER. I FELT DISCONNECTED AND I FELT LOST I KNOW HOWEVER THAT MILLIONS OF STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE AND COUNTRY AS A WHOLE FELT THE SAME WAY. AS STUDENTS RETURN TO SCHOOL THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS AND ISOLATION IF ENDEMIC HAS HAD OR MENTAL HEALTH HAS COME CLEAR. AT MY SCHOOL I KNOW SAID MANY STUDENTS ROB AND STRESSED OUT TO THE POINT OF CRYING. EVEN I WAS OVERWHELMED BY SADNESS AND STRESS RAMI. AFTER SHARING MY CONCERNS AND MY PEERS I WAS REASSURED THAT I WAS AN ONLY ONE GOING TO STRESS SLATED ISSUES. I UNDERSTOOD IMPACTS OF THE CODE NINETEEN DOMINIC ON MENTAL HEALTH OF STUDENTS I ALSO REALIZED INFLUENCE OF PEER TO PEER COMMUNICATION. BECAUSE OF THE STATUS QUO. MANY SCHOOLS ARE NOT PROPERLY FALL MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES AND EFFECTIVE SECOND SPORTS STUDENTS. AND THIS LACK OF ACCESSIBILITY WE STUDENTS FEELING AS IF THEY HAVE NO SAFE OUTLET TO SHARE AND EXPECT FOR MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS AND CONCERNS GROUPS. UBISOFT FOSTERING A SAFE INCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENT WHERE STUDENTS CAN COLLABORATE ON ISSUES RELATING MENTAL HEALTH TO RAISE AWARENESS. THESE ADVISORY GROUPS WOULD GIVE STUDENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHECK ON A LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER WILL ALSO BRING ABOUT MEANINGFUL CHANGE IN OUR SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS ON YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH HAVE BEEN IT'S CLEAR IS A CRISIS AND ONE ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION. 81% TEEN YEARS EXPERIENCE MORE STRESSED ARTICLE NINETEEN DOWN AT. SCHOOL SHOULD NOT ONLY FOCUS ON THE FISCAL IMPACT A CO NINETEEN BUT ALSO ON THE MENTAL IMPACT. WHICH IS JUST AS IMPORTANT. IF SOMEONE IS IMPACT BY PHYSICAL ILLNESS AND A LOT OF INCE'S SOMETHING CAN EASILY NOTICE AND HELP CAN EASILY ATTAINED. HOWEVER IF SOMEONE IS UNDERGOING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO RECOGNIZE THE SYMPTOMS BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. SCHOOLDIGGER SONYA CO NINETEEN- TO HANSON TANK STATIONS AND TO DISTRIBUTION OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. BUT WE STUDENTS FEEL LACK OF SUPPORT FOR OUR SCHOOLS FOR MENTAL HEALTH. SCHOOLS SHOULD FOSTER ENVIRONMENT THAT ACTIVELY WORKS TO ENSURING THAT BOTH STUDENTS AND STAFF WHO COMFORTABLE ABOUT DISCUSSING MENTAL HEALTH. BISHOP ADEQUATE ACCESSIBLE RESOURCES AND MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT. UNDER MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS ARE I BEING ACTIVELY ADDRESSED AND PRIORITIZED. TO RESPOND TO THIS ISSUE WE PROPOSE SIX EACH GOAL FOR ME QUIETEST ALLOWANCE VIæT GROUP TO ADDRESS STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS. THESE WALLETS VISOR GROUPS WILL BE ESTABLISHED AUTOMATIC FROM OSTENTATION REACHES MINIMUM SIGNATURES BY FIVE AND STUDENTS ARE MINIMUM OF STUDENTS REGULAR AND BOLD AND SCHOOL DISTRICT. TRUEST PROCESS STUDENTS WILL DRAW ATTENTION TO THE TOPIC OF MENTAL HEALTH. SINCE YOU WILL TO SHARE OPINIONS ON MENTAL HELD WITHIN THESE ADVISORY GROUPS WILL ALSO REPORTING DEFINING TO FACILITATOR WHO RESPONSIBLE COMMUNICATING WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. THE DETAILS AND FACILITATION COMMITTEE IS FREE FOR EACH WILL DECIDE ON BASED ON WHAT THEY SEE FIT. WHILE ALSO BEING PROVIDED WITH SUPPORT FROM TRAINS SOCIAL WORKERS ARE MENTAL PROFESSIONALS PROVIDED BY THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. WE HOPE HAT WOULD OUR PROPOSAL SCHOOLS ABLE TO FOSTER AND FAX INCLUSIVE VARMINT WHERE STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO CHECK IN WITH EACH OTHER AND SHARE MEDICAL CONCERNS. HE'S WON'T ADVISORY GROUPS WOULD ALLOW STUDENTS TO SHARE OPINIONS ON MEDICAL TOPICS THAT MATTER TO THEM. THIS INITIATIVE WOULD BE A STEP FORWARD TO DECREASE THE STATE NOT NOT HOLD IN SOCIETY STARTING AT SCHOOLS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I THINK THAT THIS IS JUST AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TOPIC- AND HEARING FROM YOU KNOW WE HAVE IDEAS OF SOME OF US HAVE SCHOOL I DON'T HAVE SCHOOL AGED CHILDREN BUT TO HEAR FROM YOU AND I DO WORRY ABOUT OUR HIGH SCHOOLS- BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST SO LARGE AND LIKE YOU SAID FEELING SOMEWHAT LOST. SO I REALLY DO LOVE THIS IDEA BEFORE I ASK MY QUESTIONS I'M AN OPEN IT UP TO- MY COMMITTEE MEMBERS ANYONE HAVE ANYTHING THEY WANT TO ASK. SIR- CHAU FOLK. I JUST WANT TO EXPRESS THEM IN A HUGE ADVOCATE OF BEHAVIOR HEALTH- ADVOCACY AND- REALLY TRYING TO GARNER BOTH THE RESOURCES AND THE SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR OUR OUR STUDENTS AND JUST IN CALIFORNIA IN GENERAL I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE UNDERLYING COMMON THEMES THAT I'VE HEARD ACROSS THE STATE- AND ALSO OBVIOUSLY WITHIN ARE YOU THAT YOU HAVE A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD IN HIGH SCHOOL. AND OUR SOLICITOR HAS TRULY TRY TO BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF TRYING TO ADDRESS THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH CONCERNS IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT SO I. AM IN COMPLETE SUPPORT OF TRYING TO- SUPPORT ADAM WHAT IT ESPECIALLY WITH THEIR LARGER HIGH SCHOOLS TODAY- IT. WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB ON THAT AND I THINK IT IT BEHOOVES ALL OF US TO ONE OF THE REASONS ACTUALLY THAT I RAN FOR OFFICE- WAS BECAUSE OF THE TOXIC NATURE THAT WE HAVE IN OUR SOCIETIES AND WE NEED TO START CHANGING THAT THE MODELING AND DIFFERENT WAY OF SPEAKING AND EARNED IN TONE IN IT GOVERNING. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ADVOCACY THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND DEBT BE SURE TO CONNECT WITH OUR OFFICE- IN THE DISTRICT BECAUSE I WOULD LOVE TO BE A PARTNER. IN THIS ENDEAVOR. YOU MAY HAVE JUST FOUND AN AUTHOR FOR YOUR BILL NO PRESSURE CENTER CHOI BOGUE. CENTER PAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND- REALLY APPRECIATE- THE- BEGAN GROUP COMING TOGETHER AND THE THINKING THROUGH THIS ISSUE- MAKE NOTE THAT- BILLS. IN THE LEGISLATURE AND- WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION DEBTS LAST YEAR WE PASSED DAYS ACTUALLY FOUR AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS USE MENTAL HEALTH INITIATIVES- AND- SO I THINK- I'M HOPING THAT- WITH YOUR IDEAS AND WHAT YOU THOUGHT ABOUT WE CAN PUT THESE PIECES TOGETHER- I WAS THE ONE THE BIG CHALLENGES WE HAVE IS. A LACK OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS- I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF. HEALTH ISSUES GOING ON AND- AND THEN IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME TO TRAIN MORE MORE- MORE PROVIDERS- SO BE REAL PROVIDERS SO WE NEED TO ALSO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE LEVERAGE OTHER REOURCES INCLUDING PEER SUPPORTS IS YOU'RE PROPOSING- BE A PRIMARY CARE. PHYSICIANS AND OTHER PROVIDERS AND OTHERS TO THE END AND THAT NO PART OF PROPOSAL FROM ADMINISTRATIONS ALSO TO HAVE THESE TRAIN COACHES WAS SUMMONED HEALTH COACHES AS WELL. AND SO I THINK GOOD GROUP REALLY LOVE TO SEE IS- TAKING THE IDEAS THAT YOU PRESENTED HERE AND SEEING HOW WE INTEGRATED INTO THIS MENTAL HEALTH INITIATIVES FOR USE AND OF COURSE WE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU ABOUT HOW THESE THINGS WORK- BECAUSE- IF IT'S NOT WORKING FOR YOU IT'S NOT WORKING PERIOD. SO AGAIN REALLY APPRECIATE THAT PRESENTATION LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH A WITH ALL OF YOU AND WON'T BE SURE BUT WE TALK ABOUT THE VOICE WILL BE SURE WE HEAR YOUR VOICE NOW AND SCHOOL BOARDS MIGHT BE SURE YOUR VOICE IS HEARD AND- YOU KNOW AT THAT THE PART OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES THAT ARE DEVELOPING THIS INITIATIVE AS. WELL SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER. SO I HAVE A QUESTION A DO YOU ENVISION THIS BEING- S. LIKE A CENTER THE WELL- THE ADVISOR GROUP TO HIS OF BEING LIKE A CENTER STUDENTS COULD DROP IN WHEN THEY NEED TO OR DO A VISION IT MORE AS A GROUP THAT MEETS WEEKLY OR DAILY. WHAT IS YOUR VISION. OUR ACCOUNT IS PRESENT PROPOSAL TO SABLE WITH VISION THIS MOSTLY AS PERIODIC MEETING. IN WHICH STUDENTS CAN COLLABORATE ON ISSUES REALLY MENTAL HEALTH. ALL TO SHARING YOUR NEED TO CONCERNS. FAIL TO ADDRESS HOW MENTAL ISSUES ARE AFFECTING YOUR SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR PEERS. THEY CAN WORK TOGETHER TO FIND SOLUTIONS AL TO REPORTED SHE WAS STILL TATER. IS TO SEE HOW THEY CAN ADDRESS THE ISSUE AT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT LEVEL. VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANOTHER EXCELLENT PRESENTATION WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THANK. YES I'M SORRY YEAH JUST A PERSONAL TO YOUR PRESENTATION VERY WELL DONE VERY WELL THOUGHT OUT. VERY PROFESSIONAL- TO THE STRUCTURE OF YOUR BILL- GOOD JOB- I AND I LIKE THAT THERE HAS TO BE SOME LOCAL BINA SUCH DISTRICT MANDATE OF WHAT I BELIEVE I SCHOOL DISTRICT SHOULD RUN SCHOOL DISTRICTS NOT THE STATE SO I APPRECIATE THAT THIS ISN'T JUST HEY YOU HAVE TO DO THIS IS A- THERE'S A THERE'S A PROCESS FOR SCHOOLS TO DO THIS. AND MENTAL HEALTH WE ALL KNOW IS A HUGE ISSUE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL SO IT'S AN ISSUE RIGHT NOW FOR STUDENTS. ACTUALLY AN ISSUE FOR TEACHERS AS WELL. I'LL TELL YOU THIS PLACE IS CLOSE FOR MONTHS BUT SCHOOLS WERE OPEN. AND SCHOOLS WERE OPEN- AT LEAST. YOU KNOW AS OF THIS FALL- BUT AGAIN I APPRECIATE THIS AND- THIS IS- AN ISSUE I'VE SEEN IN MY OWN HIGH SCHOOL I TEACH AT A LARGE HIGH SCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA. AND I HAVE A SIX YEAR OLD IN HIGH SCHOOL AS WELL. AND I KNOW- YOU KNOW SOMETIMES I SEE STUDENTS ARE STRUGGLING I COULDN'T DIAGNOSIS I COULDN'T TREAT IT BUT I KNEW. A STUDENT HAD SOME CHALLENGES AND I HANDED OFF TO THE COUNSELOR BUT I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT STUDENT OR OR WHAT THE COUNSELOR DID WITH. WITH WITH MY RECOMMENDATION THAT THEY CHECK IN WITH THAT STUDENTS SO WE DID A COUPLE YEARS AGO WAS AROUND A BILL. TO ESTABLISH SCHOOL SITE PROTOCOLS. MEANING EACH SCHOOL DISTRICT SHALL DEVELOP POLICY. RIGHT AGAIN NOT A STRICT MANDATE BUT SHALL AS SHALL DEVELOP A POLICY THAT FITS THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICT- SO WHEN- CANCERS ARE ALERTED TO A STUDENT WITH MAYBE A SITUATION THAT NEEDS TO BE CHECKED IN UPON- IT IS THERE IS FOLLOW THROUGH RIGHT THERE'S A THERE'S- KINDA. A PATH- SO THAT THAT THAT IS AGAIN SOMETHING I'VE DONE WITH MY OWN EXPERIENCE BUT YOU BRING IN THIS FOR THE IS A- IS A GREAT THING AND I AND- AND VERY INTERESTING IDEA. LOOK IT UP. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU MR. GOTTA SAY IT FOR ME ONE TIME. BUT I STARTED A CALL GOT HIM A COLLAR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION WE APPRECIATE YOU. ALL RIGHT NEXT UP IS MISS IRENE KIM FROM MISSION VISTA HIGH SCHOOL PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD MORNING IS THE MEMBERS OF THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS IRENE. DISTRICT AND THIRTY SEVEN SENATE DISTRICT ON BEHALF OF THE STUDENT ADVISORY BOARD ON LEGISLATION EDUCATION WE PROPOSE THAT ALL SCHOOLS BE REQUIRED TO MAKE RECYCLING AND COMPOST BINS ACCESSIBLE AROUND CAMPUS EACH ACCOMPANIED BY EDUCATIONAL SIGNS THAT CLARIFY THE CONTENTS OF THE BINS IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING FOOD CHER TABLES IN CAFETERIAS TO REDUCE FOOD WASTE. WHEN I WALK INTO SCHOOL I SEE GARBAGE CANS OVERFLOWING WITH PLASTIC BOTTLES JUICE CARTONS AND PAPER. ALL RECYCLABLE ITEMS. WITH THE AMOUNT OF SINGLE USE RECYCLED MATERIALS THAT WE PRODUCE AS A SCHOOL WE SHOULD HAVE RECYCLING BINS SPREAD OUT ACROSS EVERY CORNER OF OUR CAMPUS. NONE THE LESS I SEE NO COMPOST BINS AND FEW RECYCLING BINS WHICH GO IGNORED BECAUSE STUDENTS DON'T KNOW WHAT CAN AND CANNOT BE RECYCLED. WHEN SCHOOLS DO NOT ACTIVELY PUSH FOR STUDENTS TO PRACTICE ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY THEY ARE BEING COMPLACENT ABOUT THE CLIMATE CRISIS. THE LACK OF ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES THAT MY SCHOOL AND MANY SCHOOLS ACROSS CALIFORNIA EMPLOYEE MAKE ME EXTREMELY CONCERNED FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR EARTH. LUCKILY THERE IS A SOLUTION. BY RECYCLING AND COMPOSTING WE CAN SLOW DOWN POLLUTION PREVENT OVERFLOWING LANDFILLS AND LESSEN OUR IMPACTS ON NATURAL HABITATS. IN ADDITION EXPOSING STUDENTS TO GOOD RECYCLING AND COMPOSTING PRACTICES WILL ENCOURAGE THEM TO IMPLEMENT BACK THEM BACK HOME AND ELSEWHERE. PROVIDING STUDENTS WITH THE ABILITY TO RECYCLE AND COMPOST AT SCHOOL IS IMPERATIVE FOR THE WELLNESS OF OURSELVES AND OUR WORLD. SCHOOLS GENERATE OVER HALF A MILLION TONS OF WASTE EACH YEAR IN CALIFORNIA CONTRIBUTING SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE BUILD UP IN OUR LIMITED LANDFILL SPACE. NEARLY HALF OF SCHOOL WASTE IS RECYCLABLE OR COMPOSTABLE CARDBOARD PLASTIC BOTTLES FOOD BUT THE LACK OF RECYCLING AND COMPOSTING BINS LEAVE STUDENTS NO OPTION BUT TO THROW AWAY THESE MATERIALS AND GENERAL GARBAGE BINS. EVEN STUDENTS WERE OFFERED THE ABILITY TO RECYCLE AND COMPOST AT SCHOOL MAY LACK THE KNOWLEDGE ON HOW TO PROPERLY DO SO. IN LIGHT OF THESE OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIENCES MY GROUP MEMBERS AND I PROPOSE THAT ALL PUBLIC CALIFORNIA K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS BE EXPECTED TO IMPLEMENT RECYCLING AND COMPOST BINS AROUND THEIR SCHOOL CAMPUSES ALONG WITH INFORMATIONAL SITE. SIGNAGE THAT EXPLAINS WHAT GOES IN EACH BIN. THE FUNDING FOR EDUCATIONAL SIGNS AND THE INITIAL PAYMENT AND REPLACEMENT OF THESE BINS WOULD BE PROVIDED BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION GRANT PROGRAM OR F. A LEGIBLE REIMBURSED BY THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. SCHOOL DISTRICTS WOULD MAKE AGREEMENTS WITH LOCAL RECYCLING AND COMPOSTING CENTRES TO DISPOSE OF RECYCLABLE AND COMPOSTABLE MATERIALS INCLUDING AGREEMENTS WITH VENDORS TO PROVIDE BINS AND MANAGE WASTE. OUR PROPOSAL WOULD COMPLEMENT SENATE BILL THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE WHICH AIMS FOR A 75% REDUCTION IN LANDFILL ORGANIC WASTE FROM TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE BY PROVIDING AN AVENUE FOR SCHOOLS TO ARRANGE FOR RECYCLING AND COMPOSTING SERVICES. WE'VE ALREADY SEEN MULTIPLE DISTRICTS PUSH FORWARD SO MUCH SIMILAR PLANS. THE SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR EXAMPLE IMPLEMENTED A WASTE REDUCTION AND RECYCLING PROGRAM THAT TEACHES STUDENTS A STABLE PRACTICES. THROUGH THESE PRACTICES THE SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS SAVED OVER THREE THOUSAND TREES TWELVE MILLION GALLONS OF WATER AND OVER FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TRASH DISPOSAL COSTS. IN ADDITION WE PROPOSE THAT PUBLIC SCHOOLS PROVIDE FUTURE TABLES IN CAFETERIAS FOR STUDENTS TO PLACE THEIR UNWANTED FOOD ITEMS ON. OTHER STUDENTS CAN THEN TAKE THE ITEMS ON THIS TREE OR HAVE THE ITEMS DONATED REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF FOOD WASTE GENERATED. SCHOOL DISTRICTS COULD MODEL SAFETY STANDARDS OF OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WHICH WITH A FUTURE TABLE PROGRAM HAS DONATED EXTRA FOOD TO THOSE IN NEED WHILE LIMITING FOOD WASTE AMONG ITS THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND STUDENTS. BY IMPLEMENTING THIS PRACTICE STUDENTS WILL LEARN HOW TO RECYCLE AND COMPOST AND RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF SUSTAINABLE WASTE MANAGEMENT PRACTICING ENVIRONMENTALISM FOR A MORE SUSTAINABLE FUTURE. WE ASK STUDENTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR TAKING CARE OF THIS EARTH FOR OUR GENERATION AND FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS TO COME THEREFORE WE WILL NOT STAND IDLY BY AT IS AS IT IS POLLUTED AND SLOWLY DESTROYED. OUR HOPE IS THAT WHEN ALL STUDENTS WALK INTO THEIR SCHOOLS THEY'LL FEEL ENCOURAGED TO BE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AND KNOW THAT THEIR SCHOOLS WERE WILL PROVIDE THE MEANS TO DO SO. A NECESSITY TO CONSERVE OUR PLANET'S EXHAUSTED WILL RESOURCES AND ENSURE A HEALTHIER FUTURE FOR ALL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU THAT IS THAT WAS AN EXCELLENT PRESENTATION AND I AM A- BIG FAN OF RECYCLING AND I'M ALSO A BIG PEOPLE WHO WILL THEN NOT ONLY DO IT THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFE. BUT ALSO GO HOME AND- TEACH THEIR FAMILIES ABOUT THAT TO HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM OUR OUR BOARD- I JUST JUST QUICKLY- AGAIN VERY VERY WELL PRESENTED- AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT. YOU GUYS GO TO HIGH SCHOOL RIGHT SO YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF FOOD WASTE IN HIGH SCHOOL SO IT'S KIND OF A NO BRAINER. THAT SCHOOLS SHOULD OFFER- BINS FOR FOOD WASTE SOLELY FOOD WASTE.

SO IF YOU SEE SENATORS ASSEMBLYMEMBERS BOUNCING AROUND.

SO BUT YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME THE WHOLE TIME. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER O'DONNELL FOR BEING HERE WE APPRECIATE YOU. ALL RIGHT- AND AGAIN THANK YOU MISS KIM AND WE WILL BE IN TOUCH. OUR NEXT PRESENTER- IS R. NOV WERNER. AND YOU ARE A STUDENT AT MONTA VISTA HIGH SCHOOL PLEASE PRESENT WHEN YOU ARE READY. TO. GOOD MORNING IS THE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS ARGHA VERMONT AND I AM A JUNIOR AND MONTAVISTA HIGH SCHOOL. I AM FROM ASSEMBLY DISTRICT SIXTEEN AND SENATE DISTRICTS SIX. ON THE BEHALF OF STUDENTS OF CALIFORNIA I AM HONORED TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT THE RISING IMPORTANCE. OF FINANCIAL LITERACY EDUCATION BUT FIRST. LET ME TELL YOU A STORY. LAST YEAR WHEN MY BROTHER WENT OFF TO COLLEGE WITHIN A MONTH HE DRAINED HIS BANK ACCOUNT. WITH BAFFLING PURCHASES. FROM KNOCK OFF DESIGNER CLOTHING TWO EIGHT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS FISH TANK. WELL AFTER MAKING A COUPLE JOKES AT HIS EXPENSE WITH MY FRIENDS. THE CONVERSATION. QUICKLY TURNED TO THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING SOUND FINANCIAL DECISIONS. BECAUSE MY BROTHERS WERE ANYTHING BUT- THROUGH THIS I REALIZED THAT SHE WASN'T ALONE IN HIS STRUGGLES WITH FINANCES. SO ON THE BEHALF OF THE CIVIL DELEGATION WE PROPOSE THAT SCHOOLS INTRODUCE HIGH SCHOOL UPPERCLASSMEN TO FINANCIAL LITERACY THREE RECORDED VIDEO PRESENTATION THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE. OF BEING FINANCIALLY LITERATE ALONG WITH THE RESOURCES TO ALLOW THEM TO FURTHER THEIR EDUCATION ON THE TOPIC. IN TODAY'S SOCIETY FINANCIAL LITERACY IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY WITH MORE AND MORE PEOPLE USING CREDIT CARDS AND UNDERTAKING COMPLEX FINANCIAL DECISIONS THAN EVER BEFORE. WHILE PASSION RATIONS HEAVILY RELIED ON COMPANY PAID PENSIONS OR BENEFIT PLANS. EMPLOYERS DO USE FOR ONE K. PLANS WHEN THEY DECIDE WHERE THEY'RE CONTRIBUTION AND THEIR INVESTMENT GOES. KNOWING HOW CHECKING ACCOUNTS AND CREDIT CARDS WORK ARE BOTH INTEGRAL TO ADULTHOOD BECAUSE DESPITE WHAT I BELIEVE A COUPLE MONTHS AGO MONEY DOESN'T JUST APPEAR ON THE CARD WHENEVER MY PARENTS ARE FEELING GENEROUS. AND WHILE THIS LACK OF KNOWLEDGE MAY SEEM LIKE A PERSONAL PROBLEM. IT HAS BROAD IMPLICATIONS FOR OVERALL ECONOMIC HELP. FOR EXAMPLE JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT FINANCIAL CRISIS WARLOCK OF MORTGAGE PRODUCT UNDERSTANDING LET BORROWERS TO BE VULNERABLE TO PREDATORY LENDING. RESULTING IN A CLUB FROM WHICH MANY HAVE STILL NOT RECOVERED. VITAL FINANCIAL KNOWLEDGE SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED I DON'T EARLY AGE BUT UNFORTUNATELY MANY CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS SIMPLY DO NOT PROVIDE SUCH OPPORTUNITIES. AT HIGH SCHOOLS ACROSS CALIFORNIA FINANCIAL COURSES ARE NOT OFFERED LEAVING MANY STUDENTS TO FEEL UNPREPARED FOR WHAT COMES POST GRADUATION. THIS ISSUE IS ALSO OBSERVED AT MY HIGH SCHOOL MONTAVISTA HIGH SCHOOL IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY WHERE MOST STUDENTS FEEL LOST AND CONFUSED WHEN IT COMES TIME TO MAKE FINANCIAL DECISIONS. LEADING THEM TO MAKE BRASH PURCHASES LIKE SAY IF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLAR FISH TANK. EVEN MORE SERIOUS MANY OF MY SENIOR FRIENDS DON'T UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS OF STUDENT LOANS AND HOW OLD AFFECT THEIR LIVES POST GRADUATION. SUFFICE TO SAY MANY STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA ARE UNPREPARED FOR LACK AFTER A FOR LIFE AFTER HIGH SCHOOL MUCH OF WHICH IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE LAC OF FINANCIAL LITERACY. AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN CALIFORNIA WAS GIVEN AN F. BY THE CHAMPLIN COLLEGE CENTER FOR FINANCIAL LITERACY FOR ITS ABILITY TO PRODUCE FINANCIALLY LITERATE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES. AND I SUCH THERE IS A CLEAR IMPERATIVE TO SHIFT THE PARADIGM AND IMPROVE THE OVERALL FINANCIAL THE KNOWLEDGE OF OUR STUDENT POPULATION. AND WE MUST START WITH THE U. OUR PROPOSAL WOULD REQUIRE STUDENTS. OR WOULD REQUIRE SCHOOLS TO INTRODUCE FINANCIAL LITERACY TO ALL STUDENTS BY SHOWING IS REALLY PRESENTATION THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF FINANCIAL LITERACY OR IMPLEMENTING A FINANCIAL LITERACY COURSE INTO THEIR CURRICULUM. SCHOOLS USING A VIDEO PRESENTATION WOULD HAVE TWO OPTIONS ONE VIDEO THAT WOULD BE CREATED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION OR TO. READ THEIR OWN PRESENTATION SUBJECT TO APPROVAL OF THE DISTRICT GOVERNING BOARD TO ALLOW FOR MORE LOCAL CONTROL. THE VIDEOS WOULD COVER TOPICS BEEN INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MONEY MANAGEMENT TAXES CREDIT AND LIVING EXPENSES. AND BY DOING SO WE WILL IMPROVE THE FOUNDATIONAL FINANCIAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE YOUTH IN CALIFORNIA. FINANCIAL KNOWLEDGE POSITIVELY IMPACTS OUR COMMUNITY BY IMPROVING RATES OF SAVINGS LOWERING LEVELS OF DEBT AND INCREASING RATES OF HOUSEHOLD WEALTH ACCUMULATION. MOREOVER AS FINANCIAL LITERACY IS LINKED WITH THE ABILITY TO ESCAPE POVERTY. WE WILL BE PROVIDING CALIFORNIANS STUDENTS WITH THE MUCH NEEDED UPWARDS MOBILITY AND GIVING OUR YOUTH VALUABLE INFORMATION THAT WILL SERVE THEM FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. THEREFORE WE URGE YOU TO MEET OUR MINIMUM REQUIRED TO APPROVE OUR MINIMUM REQUIREMENT WHICH WILL ACCENTUATE THE IMPORTANCE OF FINANCIAL LITERACY EXPOSE STUDENTS TO CRUCIAL FINANCIAL TOPICS. AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO PURSUE MORE FINANCIAL KNOWLEDGE. I URGE YOU TO PRIORITIZE SETTING CALIFORNIANS TUNES ON THE RIGHT PATH TO BECOMING MORE FINANCIALLY LITERATE AND CREATING A NEW PARADIGM OF PROSPERITY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER PANDA GERMANY COMMENTS. THANK THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION- ACTUALLY- I KNOW THAT- LOCALLY HERE IN SACRAMENTO ARE UNITED WE ACTUALLY INVESTED A LOT AND FINANCIAL LITERACY PARTICULAR FOR FOSTER YOUSEF WHO- OFTENTIMES. BECAUSE OF THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES STILL HAVE AS MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO. GAIN THIS EXPERTISE- THIS KNOWLEDGE I GUESS MY QUESTION TO YOU. IS THAT- WE AT SURPRISED RELATED TO THE FIRST PRESENTATION AROUND THE ALSO THE STUDENT GAUGE MEANT IS THAT- WE CAN PUT THE INFORMATION IN FRONT OF PEOPLE I MEAN IF YOU'RE HERE IN HIGH SCHOOL YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE PAY ATTENTION CLASS AND SO FORTH- HOW. HOW DO WE DO THIS IN A WAY THAT'S NOT PERHAPS MORE. ENGAGING INTERACTIVE SO PEOPLE CAN. MAKE THE CONNECTIONS ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT WHAT THEY'RE LEARNING IS SO. I THINK THAT POLICE MANY EDUCATORS I TALKED TO HER SCHOOL DISTRICT'S NON NON SAYS WELL FINANCIAL LITERACY IS IMPORTANT SO- BUT HOW DO YOU INTEGRATE INTO THE CURRICULUM AND THEN ALSO DO IN A WAY THAT'S- ENGAGING ENOUGH SO THAT- PEOPLE PAY ATTENTION RIGHT. AND IS IT IS IT AT THE RIGHT YEAH AND HOW DO YOU DO IN A WAY THAT SORT OF- TARGETS- THE CHALLENGES THAT STUDENTS ARE CURRENTLY FACING SO. I'LL TELL YOU THAT- NIGHT A TV AND I TEACH. HIGHER EDUCATION- AND THEN YOU WOULD THINK THAT YOU KNOW I SCHOOL STUDENTS YOU THINK FOR THE LONG THAT- YOU MIGHT. THIS MIGHT BE MORE IMPORTANT AND- IT'S STILL AMAZING HOW OFTEN PEOPLE- YOU KNOW YOU START TALKING ABOUT FINANCIAL LITERACY MISTER TUNING YOU OUT. WILL I HAVE OTHER THINGS ARE MORE IMPORTANT TO ME. SO I THINK YOU MAKE AN EXCELLENT CASE ABOUT WHY IT'S IMPORTANT I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING YOU PRESENTED- I THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA. I AM JUST INTERESTED AND THINKING ABOUT HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT HOW DO YOU BETTER ENGAGE STUDENTS- SO. GREAT WILL DO A PRESENTATION AND- HOW DO WE ENGAGE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY- IN A WAY THAT IT'S- THAT THEY SEE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO THEM AND DO IN A WAY THAT'S INTERACTIVE AND- AND REALLY ENGAGES THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THERE. BECAUSE I'M SURE YOU HAVE PLENTY OF PRESENTATIONS HE SAID THROUGH AN CLASS WHERE YOU'RE LIKE OKAY WELL THAT'S NICE AND- BUT I DON'T SEE HOW CONNECTS TO ME HOW GREAT SO- AND THEN MAYBE YOU'RE OUT REALLY GOOD STUDENTS IS A WELL ANYWAY I'M GONNA REALLY PAY ATTENTION BUT- YOU ALSO HAVE CLASSMATES WHO ARE LIKE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME- IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT'S CONNECTED TO MY LIFE. I HAVE OTHER THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT THEY'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION. BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE QUESTION AND I'M REALLY. TO HEAR THAT YOU DISTRICT HAS INVESTED IN FINANCIAL LITERACY. SO I THINK. THERE IS THIS GENERAL CONSENSUS THAT THERE IS APATHY IN SCHOOL WELL ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU. TOOK A TAKE A LOOK AT SUBJECTS LIKE MATH PEOPLE SAY ONE OF MY GOING TO USE THIS IN THE REAL LIFE. BUT I THINK FINANCIAL LITERACY IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT BECAUSE- IT INHERENTLY APPLIES TO ALL OF US- AND THE SECOND PROBLEM. I THINK. IS LACK OF ACCESSIBILITY RIGHT NOW BECAUSE- ALTHOUGH A LOT OF SCHOOLS OFFER ECONOMICS CLASSES DOES NOT THE SAME AS FINANCIAL LITERACY. I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE ON THAT. BUT MANY STUDENTS AT MY SCHOOL FOR EXAMPLE DON'T HAVE. ACCESS TO THOSE RESOURCES RIGHT THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE TO SEARCH THEY DON'T HAVE. PEOPLE TELLING THEM HERE'S WHERE YOU CAN LOOK. TO BECOME MORE FINANCIALLY LITERATE. AND ESPECIALLY AS MANY OF THEM ARE LOOKING TO TAKE ON STUDENT LOANS. AND DIDN'T YOU KNOW BY YOU GET CREDIT CARDS AND TAKE COMPLEX FINANCIAL DECISIONS. I THINK. IT WOULD BE REALLY USEFUL FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE INTRODUCTORY. COURSE TO FINANCIAL LITERACY TO. SHOW THEM WHERE THE RESOURCES ARE BECAUSE- I DON'T THINK THAT THE SAME LEVEL OF APATHY IS THERE FOR FINANCIAL LITERACY. I THINK- PROVIDING ACCESSIBILITY FOR THESE COURSES. IS GOING TO BE VERY HELPFUL ESPECIALLY TO THE STUDENTS WHO ARE INTERESTED- AND THEN I THINK THE PART ABOUT ENGAGEMENT- WHAT WHEN WE MAKE DE. THE COURSE. BUT WHEN WE MAKE IT TAILORED TO THE STUDENTS THEMSELVES I THINK WILL NATURALLY FEEL MORE INCLINED TO BE ENGAGED BECAUSE- IT REFLECTS. HOW THEY'LL DO LATER ON IN LIFE THINK THAT FINANCIAL LITERACY IS JUST OF THE MOST CRITICAL IMPORTANCE- WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL BACK IN THE DARK AGES WE HAD AN ECONOMICS CLASS. AND IN THAT ECONOMICS CLASS OUR INSTRUCTOR I STILL REMEMBER SHE TAUGHT US HOW TO DO SOMETHING WHICH I'M SURE NONE OF YOU KNOW HOW TO DO WHICH IS TO WRITE A CHECK- AND HOW TO PAY YOUR BILLS. AND WE TALKED ABOUT- YOU KNOW RENT AND WAGES AND IF YOU MAKE THIS MUCH WHAT CAN YOU AFFORD AND I DO THINK THAT THAT IS LACKING- BEFORE THE PANDEMIC ON TEAM NAY BUT WE WOULD ALWAYS HAVE A YOUNG WOMEN'S AND A YOUNG MEN'S CONFERENCE. EACH YEAR AT OUR- LAST I BELIEVE IS OUR LAST TEN MINS CONFERENCE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WE HAD ABOUT. A LITTLE OVER TWO HUNDRED YOUNG MEN THAT WE DID SOMETHING CALLED MAD CITY MONEY AND IT WAS PUT ON AND I THINK THIS WOULD BE- GREAT IN ALL OF OUR HIGH SCHOOLS AND EVEN IN OUR JUNIOR HIGHS- IS PUT ON BY A- CREDIT UNION. AND SO THE YOUNG MEN WERE PAIRED UP AND THEY WERE A COUPLE THAT WERE EACH GIVEN A PROFESSION AND HOW MUCH THEY MADE IT THAT PROFESSION THEY WERE GIVEN- SOME HAD CHILDREN SOME DID NOT HAVE CHILDREN. AND THEN THEY WERE TOLD THAT THEY HAD NINE ARE ELEVEN DIFFERENT SPOTS TO GO TO AND THEY HAD THREE CHOICES OF HOW MUCH RENT THEY WANT TO PAY WHAT KIND OF CAR THEY WANT TO DRIVE OR DO THEY WANT TO TAKE A BUS TO SAVE MONEY- HOW MUCH IS SPENT. ON FOOD HOW MUCH CHILD CARE WAS IT WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING AND I WAS WORRIED TO DOCTOR PANTS FOR A POINT THAT THESE YOUNG MEN MIGHT NOT FIND IT ENGAING BUT THEY ALL DID A PHENOMENAL JOB AND I WANT ONE OF THE- THAT THE TWO THAT WERE PAIRED UP THEY CAME OVER AND SAID. OKAY WHERE DO WE GO FOR COUNSELLING BECAUSE WE'RE FIGHTING AND- AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS GREAT AND VERY ACCURATE WHAT HAPPENS IN LIFE SO I DO REALLY THINK THAT WE NEED TO FIGURE SOMETHING OUT- AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS ISN'T THE END OF THIS PARTICULAR CREDIT UNION WOULD DO IT. ANYWHERE BUT- LET ME NOODLE ON THAT A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU. YOU KNOW YOU YOU'RE GROWING UP AND- YOU KNOW. YOU HAVE A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD SO. HOPEFULLY AND YOU HAVE FOOD ON THE TABLE AND A LOT OF TIMES ON YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T KNOW. WHAT THE COST OF THAT IS THE COST OF KEEPING THE LIGHTS ON- THAT A MINIMUM WAGE JOB AT FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR IS ACTUALLY A POVERTY WAGE JOBS- SO I THINK THIS IS JUST CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AS WELL SO I. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION. AND WE'LL A WE'LL LOOK AT THE THEY THINK THERE ARE TWO BILLS MOVING IN THE ASSEMBLY. THAT ADDRESS THIS AND SO MAYBE AS THEY COME OVER HOPEFULLY TO. SENATE EDUCATION- WE CAN WORK ON MAY BE INSERTING SOMETHING- WITH THIS MAD CITY MONEY. PROGRAM I THINK THAT IT WOULD- WE DID WITH OUR YOUNG MEN BUT OBVIOUSLY WE WANT OUR YOUNG WOMEN TO BENEFIT FROM THAT TOO SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. EXCELLENT TOPIC AN EXCELLENT PRESENTATION THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME YOU ARE QUITE WELCOME. ALL RIGHT NEXT WE ARE GOING TO OUR LAST PROVOKE PROPOSAL WHICH WILL BE PRESENTED BY CHRISTY TO. IS IT TOO OR TOW CHRISTINE. TELL VERY GOOD THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE YOUR STUDENT AT NORTHWOOD HIGH SCHOOL. PLEASE PRESENT WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD IS THEMEMBERS OF THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS CHRISTY TELL AND I'M FROM THE SIXTEENTH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT AND THIRTY SEVEN SENATE DISTRICT. AND I'M A SOPHOMORE AT NORTHWOOD HIGH SCHOOL. ON BEHALF OF THE STUDENT ADVISORY BOARD ON LEGISLATION IN EDUCATION. WE PROPOSE THAT ONE THIRD OF SCHOOL SITE COUNCIL MEMBERSHIP. BE COMPOSED OF STUDENTS. IN ORDER FOR STUDENTS TO HAVE AN ACTIVE VOICE IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESSES. OF SCHOOL SAFETY PLANS AND OTHER SCHOOL SAFETY RELATED TOPICS. UPON DISCUSSION WITH MY PEERS I WAS SHOCKED TO LEARN THAT OTHER STUDENTS SHARE THE SAME FEELINGS OF EASE THAT I WAS EXPERIENCING CONCERNING MY SAFETY AT SCHOOL. HI MY HIGH SCHOOL NORTHWOOD HIGH SCHOOL IN ORANGE COUNTY STUDENTS HAVE LOVE CLASSES DUE TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE CLASSROOM. LEAVING MY PEERS AND I IN CONSTANT FEAR OF THE DANGERS AT SCHOOL. I FEEL HOPELESS BECAUSE MY SCHOOL'S FACULTY HAVE NOT TAKEN PROPER SAFETY MEASURES TO COMBAT THESE DANGERS. MANY STUDENTS LIKE MYSELF NOW DO NOT FEEL SAFE GOING TO SCHOOL BECAUSE OF THIS SCHOOL AND HOMES AT HIGH SCHOOL IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY THERE HAS BEEN A BOMB THREAT IN SEVERAL INSTANCES OF STUDENTS BRINGING GUNS ON CAMPUS. AT WEST VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY STUDENT FIGHTS NEAR CAMPUS HAVE ESCALATED INTO SHOOTINGS THAT CAUSED THE SCHOOL TO GO ON LOCKDOWN. SCHOOL A PLACE THAT SHE FOSTER STUDENT DEVELOPMENT AND LEARNING THIS SAFE AND PROTECTED ENVIRONMENT HAS BECOME A PLACE OF FEAR FOR STUDENTS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A PLATFORM TO VOICE THEIR SAFETY CONCERNS. IT IS APPARENT THAT TO A LOT OF STUDENT REPRESENTATION IN SETTING SCHOOL SAFETY GUIDELINES THE CURRENT SCHOOL SAFETY GUIDELINES DO NOT ADEQUATELY REPRESENT STUDENT NEEDS. CALIFORNIA REQUIRES EVERY PUBLIC SCHOOL TO CREATE A COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOL SAFETY PLANS THAT IS APPROVED BY EACH SCHOOL SITE COUNCIL WHICH IS A DECISION MAKING GROUP OF EDUCATION PARTNERS OF THE SCHOOL COMMUNITY. HOWEVER THESE PENS RARELY INCLUDE STUDENT INPUT AND FAIL TO ADDRESS THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS OF STUDENTS. INSTEAD THEY ADDRESS ADULTS PERCEIVED THREATS TO SCHOOL SAFETY. THEREFORE WE NEED MORE STUDENT REPRESENTATION TO MAINTAIN ACCOUNTABILITY IN OUR SCHOOL SAFETY GUIDELINES. IN CALIFORNIA THE RISE OF VIOLENCE WITHIN SCHOOLS HAS CREATED A GROWING MOVEMENT FOR BETTER REGULATION OF SCHOOL SAFETY BALK AT THE LOCAL AND STATE LEVEL. AMID THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING SEVERE THREATS TO THEIR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL SAFETY. HAVING MORE STUDENT VOICES IN SCHOOL SITE COUNCILS WOULD ALLOW FOR MORE ADVOCACY FOR STUDENT PHYSICAL AND MENTAL SAFETY. SENIOR REPRESENTATION IN SCHOOL SITE COUNCILS IS ESSENTIAL TO MOVE PAST THE UNSAFE ENVIRONMENTS IN SCHOOLS TODAY. IN LIGHT OF THESE OBSERVATIONS WE HAVE DEVELOPED A SOLUTION. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD GIVE STUDENTS A PLATFORM BY HAVING AT LEAST ONE THIRD OF SCHOOL SITE COUNCIL MEMBERSHIPS BE COMPOSED OF STUDENTS. A SCHOOL SITE COUNCIL IS A DECISION MAKING BODY THAT REPRESENTS ALL EDUCATION PARTNERS OF THE SCHOOL COMMUNITY OF EQUAL AMOUNTS OF ADMINISTRATORS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS. STUDENTS SERVING ON THE COUNCIL SHOULD BE GRANTED MANY OF THE SAME PRIVILEGES AS SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION STAFF AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS HAVING THE ABILITY TO VOICE CONCERNS AND MAKE CHANGES ON THE TOPIC OF SCHOOL SAFETY. IN ADDITION STUDENTS ON THE COUNCIL WOULD OVERSEE THE CREATION AND APPROVAL OF EACH SCHOOLS DISTRICTS ANNUAL COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOL SAFETY PLAN. TO ENSURE THAT THEIR RESPECTIVE STUDENT BODIES FEEL THAT THEIR WELL BEING IS A HIGH PRIORITY. DUE TO THE NATURE OF THIS PROPOSAL THIS PLAN WILL REQUIRE NO COST. THIS SOLUTION ALLOWS SCHOOL SITES AND DISTRICTS TO CREATE AND ADOPT SCHOOL SAFETY PLANS BASED ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS WELL ACTIVELY INCORPORATING STUDENT INPUT TO ENSURE EACH CAMPUS PRIORITIZE A SCHOOL SAFETY. AND MANY SHOOTERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO PURSUE OPEN DIALOGUE WITH THEIR STUDENTS THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING THEIR COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOL SAFETY PLANS BY PROVIDING FORMS OF COMMUNICATION ACCESSIBLE TO THE ENTIRE STUDENT BODY. SIXTY IS ESSENTIAL TO OPTIMIZING LEARNING AS WELL AS STUDENT STAFF RELATIONSHIPS THEREFORE PRIORITIZING STUDENT REPRESENTATION AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SCHOOL SAFETY PLANS AND PROTOCOLS WILL ALLOW STUDENTS TO BE MORE SUCCESSFUL. BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING GIVEN A VOICE TO REPRESENT THEMSELVES WITHIN THEIR SAFETY AND THEIR EDUCATION. OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM IS ONE THAT VALUES STUDENT SAFETY AND SUCCESS SO WE HOPE THAT SCHOOL SITE COUNCILS HAVING A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF SEAT REPRESENTATION WILL UPHOLD THIS BELIEF. I STUDENTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN EDUCATION THEY DESERVE TO FEEL PROTECTED AND COMFORTABLE WHEN LEARNING. WITH THIS PLAN STUDENTS WILL BE EMPOWERED TO TAKE CHARGE OF THEIR OWN SAFETY AND SUCCEED IN AN IMPROVED ENVIRONMENT THAT PRIORITIZES THEIR WELL BEING THANK YOU. YOU VERY MUCH EXCELLENT PRESENTATION- CENTER PANDA GERMANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND- GOOD IT IS A FIRST OF ALL- DOWN THE DATA ON VIOLENCE IN SCHOOLS- ACTUALLY I THINK- WAS PRETTY COVE IT WAS ACTUALLY I THINK- HEADING DOWNWARD BUT- WE DON'T REALLY HAVE GOOD DATA POST CODE- AND UNFORTUNATELY I MEAN IT IT ANECDOTALLY IT'S UP. AND IT SEEMS TO BE UP THIS OR RELATED TO ACTUALLY UNFORTUNATELY INCREASE VIOLENCE IN THE GENERAL COMMUNITY- AND- AND UNFORTUNATELY ALSO- SOMETIMES PARENTS DON'T MODEL THE PROGRAM BEHAVIOR WITH SCHOOL LEADERS WHAT IT SCHOOL BOARD SOURCE TEACHERS OR SCHOOL LEADERS AS WELL AND THAT OF COURSE PROBLEMS. SOME STUDENTS TEND TO IMITATE THOSE PARENTS AND THEN. ENGAGE AND WHETHER IT'S THREATENING BEHAVIOR VIOLENT BEHAVIOR SO I THINK THAT SOMETHING TO BE YOU KNOW THE FORTUNE WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DRESS AS WELL IT'S- IT'S NOT STUDENTS PARENTS THAT- THERE'S NOT SHOWING RESPECT TO THEIR SCHOOL LEADERS AND- ENGAGING IN. INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR WE'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE CASES OF THAT AND INDEED FOR PUBLIC FORMS UNFORTUNATELY. I AGREE WITH YOU THAT WE NEED TO HAVE STUDENTS MUCH MORE ENGAGED AFTER ALL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SAFETY YOU KNOW IT'S A IT IS ABOUT STUDENTS ABOUT SPIT OUT THE TEACHERS AND STAFF BUT I MEAN STUDENTS ARE VERY MUCH PART OF THAT AND NEED TO BE ENGAGED IN HELPING DEVELOP SOLUTIONS. AND OFTEN TIMES- WITH SUITS SOLUTIONS BEING DEVELOPED WITHOUT THE HMO STUDENTS YOU CAN END UP WITH EVEN SOMETIMES YOU KNOW HARMFUL US- SOLUTION SO FOR EXAMPLE- CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND HIS CONCERNS ABOUT YOU KNOW POTENTIAL IT'S A- THE- GUN VIOLENCE INCIDENT AND THEN THE SCHOOL RIGHT. BUT THE ANSWER IS NOT NECESSARILY TO HAVE IT DRILLED WHERE UNFORTUNATELY ONE SCHOOL DISTRICT WHERE DAY. HAD TEACHERS YOU KNOW THEY HAD TO JUST PRETEND LIKE THEY WERE SHOT BY PEOPLE I MEAN THAT THAT WAS REALLY TRAUMATIC FOR THE STUDENTS TO HAVE TO WITNESS THAT- IS BUSY PART OF THE DRILL RIGHT IT WAS- AND SO FORTH. AND I'M NOT SURE WHO WOULD THINK THAT WAS A ACTUALLY A GOOD IDEA- AND THAT AND THEN OF WE NEED TO BE SURE WE SHOULD THAT THAT THE- YEAH. ITS AT THE- PEOPLE ARE DEVELOPING THESE PLANS ARE TO THE STUDENTS. ALL RIGHT AT THE THEIR FEARS IT DIDN'T NOT JUST THE MAN ARE FEARS BUT WHAT THE ACTUALLY THE ACTUAL. ARE SO I THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT- AND- I MEAN WE NEED TO HAVE GOOD DATA SO WE KNOW WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON AT BUT ALSO SAFETY IS PARTIALLY PERCEPTION TOO SO WE NEED TO BE SURE. PROBABLY DEALING WITH PERCEPTION AND THEN OF COURSE WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT STANDARDS OF BEHAVIOR FOR EVERYONE. RIGHT EVERYONE WHO'S ON HIS ENGAGING IN THE SCHOOL AND THE SCHOOL CAMPUSES SO THAT AND BOB ISN'T ENGAGING THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY SO CERTAINLY. YOU KNOW WE CAN TALK ABOUT STUDENTS AND TEACHERS AND PRINCIPLES AND OTHER SCHOOL LEADERS BUT IF AGAIN IF THE COMMUNITY ITSELF IS NOT MODELING THE KIND OF THE THAT TYPE BEHAVIOR THAT'S GOING TO BE REALLY HARD. FOR THINGS IN SCHOOL SO- REALLY APPRECIATE THIS PRESENTATION- AND- I THINK YOU KNOW THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE GET STUDENTS MUCH MORE. IN IN DEVELOPMENT SCHOOLS SCHOOL SAFETY PLANS AND- AND CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTFULNESS AND- YOUR YOUR SUGGESTION. IT SUGGESTIONS. FOR ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER PAN- I ECHO IT A CENTER. BECAUSE ABOUT. BEHAVIOR BEING MODELED- BY PARENTS NOT ALL PARENTS BUT I HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND SOME SCHOOL BOARD MEETINGS AND- IN MY DISTRICT IN RECENT MONTHS. AND TO SAY I AM APPALLED- WOULD BE. ACCURATE AND IT'S JUST I. D. YOU STUDENTS GIVE ME HOPE FOR THE FUTURE. BECAUSE WHEN I SEE PARENTS- PARADING AROUND YELLING AND SCREAMING AT SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS. I HONESTLY I FEEL BAD FOR THEM BECAUSE NO ONE HAS TAUGHT THEM IN THEIR LIFE THAT THAT IS NOT HOW YOU GET THINGS DONE- YOU CAN BE ANGRY. YOU COULD BE UPSET AND YOU COULD WANT CHANGE BUT THERE'S AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO DO IT AND ALL OF YOU ARE MODELING THAT BEHAVIOR. AND I'VE SEEN THAT THE SCHOOL BOARD MEETINGS TO- IS WHERE THE STUDENTS HAVE MODELED THE BEHAVIOR AND THE PARENTS SHOULD TAKE HEED AND EVEN SOME OF THE TEACHERS HAVE BEEN. OUT OF LINE AS WELL. SO WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO IN THAT AREA- YOU SHOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE AND SAFE AT SCHOOL. AS SOMEONE WHO HAS WORKED ON A LOT OF HARASSMENT SEXUAL HARASSMENT. ISSUES AND BILLS SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE- IT TROUBLES ME TO HEAR THAT YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE BEING SEXUALLY HARASSED. AT SCHOOL- AGAIN A LOT OF THAT COMES FROM HOME AND ARE WE TEACHING OUR YOUNG MEN TO BE GOOD YOUNG MEN. AND ARE WE TEACHING OUR YOUNG WOMEN TO HOW TO HOW DO YOU REACT TO THOSE THINGS- AND A BUT I JUST. THAT BOTHERS ME THAT THAT THAT YOU FEEL THAT YOU'RE SEXUALLY HARASSED IN HIGH SCHOOL. SO WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO AS A LEGISLATURE- AND OF COURSE JUST FEELING SAFE AND WORRYING ABOUT A GUN BEING BROUGHT TO SCHOOL AND- AND LOSING YOUR LIFE- WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO AS- A STATE. AND AS A COUNTRY SO THANK YOU FOR THE WELL THOUGHT OUT PROPOSAL- I WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE IT AND WE WILL WE WILL TAKE IT ALL TO HEART. THANK YOU MISTER. SO MUCH.
