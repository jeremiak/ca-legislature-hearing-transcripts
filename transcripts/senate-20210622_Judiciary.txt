INSECURE AND TREACHEROUS THE APPS ARE OFTEN FULL OF GLITCHES AND SERIOUSLY VULNERABLE TO SCAMS WHEN PEOPLE ENCOUNTER PROBLEMS THEY OFTEN HAVE NOWHERE TO TURN. THEY OFTEN FALL VICTIM TO ANOTHER SCAM BECAUSE OF THAT CONFUSION. CURRENT REGULATIONS DO NOT OFFER SUFFICIENT PROTECTION AND VULNERABLE USERS ARE LEFT WITHOUT RECOURSE. AB THIRTEEN TWENTY SIMPLY REQUIRES CASH TRANSFER SERVICES TO LIST A CUSTOMER HELP PHONE NUMBER. PROMINENTLY ON THE WEBSITE AD RESPOND TO CUSTOMERS WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME FRAME.

WE AGREE WITH HIS FAMILY MEMBER THAT CONSUMERS DESERVE HIGH LEVELS OF CUSTOMER SERVICE WHEN IT COMES TO MONEY TRANSMISSION ISSUES- WE AGREE WITH THAT FOUNDATIONAL PREMISE THAT- IN THIS BILL. BERS INVEST A LOT OF TIMES STAFF AND RESOURCES TO GIVE CONSUMERS CHOICES ON HOW THEY CAN GET IN CONTACT WITH OUR COMPANIES WHEN ISSUES ARISE. IN THAT WE SHARE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS CONCERNED IN THAT RESPECT. WHERE WE DIFFER WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS ON THE PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BILL OF LANGUAGE- THAT'S CURRENTLY IN PRINT TODAY- ACROSS THE ENTIRE LICENSEE UNIVERSE. OUR CONCERNS ON THIS FRONT CAN REALLY BE BOILED DOWN INTO FOUR MAIN THINGS. NUMBER ONE WE ARE STRONGLY CONCERNED ABOUT EIGHTY THIRTEEN TWENTIES PROPOSE REQUIREMENTS THAT A LICENSEE. REPLY WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO CONSUMER CONTEXT LICENSEE FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE ISSUES. AND THE SPECIFIC OBLIGATIONS OUTLINED IN THE BILL WITH RESPECT TO HOW OUR MEMBERS REPLY TO THIS ISSUE. MR SCRIPTED REQUIREMENTS FOR THE TIMING AND NATURE OF THE RESPONSE TO ANY OUTRAGE A LICENSEE CONFLICT WITH OTHER REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS THE LICENSEES HAVE. IN MANY CASES COULD INADVERTENTLY RESULT IN CONSUMERS RECEIVING INFERIOR AT ASSISTANCE. SOLVING MATTERS. NUMBER TWO WE ARE CONCERNED THAT A B. THIRTEEN TWENTY TO PROPOSE REQUIREMENTS TO PROVIDE A QUOTE INDIVIDUALIZED REPLY IN QUOTE WITHIN THAT TWENTY FOUR HOUR TIME FRAME OF BEING CONTACTED. BY A CONSUMER FOR A CUSTOMER SERVICE ISSUE WOULD CREATE SIGNIFICANT COMPLIANCE AND LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES FOR LICENSEES AND COULD DISRUPT PROCESSES CURRENTLY IN PLACE TO ADDRESS CUSTOMER CONCERNS AND ISSUES RELATING TO LICENSEES PROVISION A MUD MONEY TRANSMISSION SERVICES. THE REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE AN INDIVIDUALIZED REPLY TO ANY CONTACT RECEIVED BY THE LICENSEE RELATED TO CUSTOMER SERVICE ISSUES AS BROAD AND VAGUE AND INCONSISTENT WITH CURRENT NATIONWIDE STANDARDS. REGULATORY MEASURES THAT LICENSEES HAVE TO MEET. NUMBER THREE ALL RIGHTY THANK YOU FOR YOUR LAPTOP. YOU'RE BEYOND YOU TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT A FAIRLY FOUND MISTER BELL SO- ALTHOUGH WE'RE IN OUT OF ORDER BUT MISTER BELL. THANK YOU SO MUCH- CHAIRMAN NUMBER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CHUCK BELL I'M PROGRAM DIRECTOR FOR CONSUMER REPORTS. WE'RE A NATIONAL NONPROFIT MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS WITH CONSUMERS FOR FAIR AND TRANSPARENT MARKETPLACE. THE POPULARITY OF CASH TRANSFER APPS AND ONLINE SERVICES HAS GROWN BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS WITH MORE THAN NINETY MILLION ADULTS NOW USING MOBILE PAYMENT APPS. IN OUR RESEARCH CONSUMER REPORTS ABOUT CONSUMERS DO SOMETIMES HAVE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS USING THESE SERVICES. AND WHEN THEY DO THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO CONTACT THE COMPANY DIRECTLY TO GET HELP QUICKLY. YET FEW SERVICE PROVIDERS MAKE TELEPHONE CONTACT NUMBERS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE LEAVING CONSUMERS HIGHLY FRUSTRATED. BY NOT PROVIDING PHONE NUMBERS MONEY SERVICE BUSINESSES ARE LEAVING THE DOOR OPEN FOR SCAMMERS TO POSE AS HELPLINES FOR THE APPLE OR SERVICE. AND GAIN ACCESS TO THE USER'S HIGHLY SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION TO COMMIT FRAUD. IN ADDITION TWITTER AND REDDIT ARE FULL OF COMPLAINTS FROM CONSUMERS WHO ARE URGENTLY SEEKING HELP FROM COMPANIES THEY ENTRUSTED THEIR MONEY TO. SOME LIKE VICTOR ON TWITTER EXPLAINED HE TRIED EMAILING A MONEY TRANSFER APP COMPANY AND THEN GET A RESPONSE FOR TWO WEEKS. AND IS DESPERATE TO FIND A PHONE NUMBER FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE TO TALK TO. HAS MONEY TRANSFER APPS BECOME MORE POPULAR CONSUMERS ARE INCREASINGLY RELIANT ON DIGITAL FINANCIAL TOOLS TO MANAGE THEIR PRECIOUS HOUSEHOLD FUNDS. WHAT'S THE FUNDS COULD BE CATASTROPHIC TO FAMILIES EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL HARDSHIP. PEOPLE RELIANT ON MONEY SERVICES BUSINESSES TO MOVE MONEY SHOULD NOT HAVE TO SEARCH SO HARD FOR HEALTH. PROVIDER SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO DO MORE TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM FALLING VICTIM TO SCAMMERS WHEN SEEKING ASSISTANCE. SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS AB THIRTEEN TWENTY IS AN EXCELLENT FIRST STEP TOWARDS ENSURING THAT PROVIDERS LIVE UP TO CONSUMER EXPECTATIONS TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE IN THE EVENT THAT THE USERS ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES. BEHALF OF THE CONSUMERS WE REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA CONSUMER REPORT STRONGLY URGES AND I FELL ON A. B. THIRTEEN TWENTY NINE THANK YOU MISTER BELL.

TELL ME- SO CURRENTLY THE LAW REQUIRES THAT WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS THEY PROVIDE INDIVIDUALIZED RESPONSE ALTHOUGH WE ARE I WILL CLARIFY THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT OPPOSITION HAS ASKED IS FOR US TO HAVE A SAFE HARBOR. FOR COMPANIES THAT DO PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT CALL CENTER TIME FOR THEM TO GET THAT INDIVIDUALIZED RESPONSE ON THE PHONE AND WE ARE WORKING ON THAT LANGUAGE AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY HAVE ASKED FOR IS FOR US TO EXTEND OUT THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR TIME PERIOD NOW I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU THE FBI. HAS CONCERNS ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THEY WERE THEY'VE ASKED US TO MOVE IT TO THREE DAYS AND IN FACT THERE ARE CERTAIN CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT WILL BE WEAKENED IF WE MOVE IT DOES THAT TWO THREE DAYS SO WE ARE WORKING WITH BOTH THE AGENCY. AND OPPOSITION TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE RIGHT TIME FRAME IS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS. AND MAKE IT FEASIBLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THAT I THINK- I REALLY LIKE THE BILL BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING WORSE. THAN NOT HAVING A LIVE PERSON TO ASK A QUESTION.

HAVE YOU EVER TRIED TO CANCEL A SERVICE ONLINE ONLY TO BE CONFRONTED WITH AN INCONVENIENCE CONFUSING TIME CONSUMING PROCESS THAT SEEMS DESIGNED TO GET YOU TO GIVE UP AND KEEP PAYING. OR SIGN UP FOR FREE TRIAL OFFER SUBSCRIPTION AT A PROMOTIONAL PRICE ONLY TO FORGET AND LATER BE CHARGED FULL PRICE FOR A PRODUCT OR SERVICE YOU DON'T REALLY WANT OR NEED. TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE EXPERIENCE OF A FORMER CAPITOL STAFFER WHO STRUGGLE TO CANCEL HER CLASS PASS SUBSCRIPTION. SHE WORKED HER WAY THROUGH THE APP HOPING TO FIND A BUTTON TO CANCEL BUT THERE WASN'T ONE. SO SHE RESORTED TO USING THE CHAT FEATURE. HER STRUGGLE CONTINUED AS THE CUSTOMER REPRESENTATIVE ASKED FOR AND ASKED HER NUMEROUS QUESTIONS. FORCING HER TO EXPLAIN THAT SHE WAS QUITTING HER JOB MOVING GOING BACK TO SCHOOL I COULD NO LONGER FOR THE SERVICE. ALL PERSONAL INFORMATION THE CONSUMER SHOULD NOT HAVE TO SHARE THE CANCELLATION IN SAP. THE BUSINESS ALSO TRIED OFFERING HER OTHER SERVICES WHICH SHE DECLINED. THIS EXPERIENCE AND OTHERS HIGHLIGHT THE NEED TO STRENGTHEN CALIFORNIA LAW TO PROTECT CONSUMERS EIGHTY THREE NINETY WOULD DO TWO THINGS FIRST IT WOULD REQUIRE BUSINESSES TO NOTIFY CONSUMERS BEFORE THE EXPIRATION OF A FREE GIFT TRIAL OR PROMOTIONAL OR DISCOUNTED PRICE THAT IS LONGER THAN THIRTY ONE DAYS. BEFORE THE EXPIRATION OF A SUBSCRIPTION THAT AUTOMATICALLY RENEWS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS OR LESS FREQUENTLY. SECONDED TO ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS DO NOT HAVE TO JUMP THROUGH HOOPS AND INDOOR LENGTHY LENGTHY CANCELLATION PROCESS THE BILL SPECIFIES THAT CONSUMERS MUST BE ABLE TO CANCEL THEIR SUBSCRIPTIONS ONLINE AT WILL AND WITHOUT ANY FURTHER STEPS THAT OBSTRUCT OR DELAY THEIR ABILITY TO CANCEL IMMEDIATELY. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS AND I AM PLEASED THAT THE LATEST ROUND OF AMENDMENTS MOVED MOST OF THE OPPOSITION TO NEUTRAL. WITH ME TODAY BY PHONE IS ALAMEDA COUNTY DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY MATTHEW BELL TRAUMA ON BEHALF OF THE ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY NANCY O'MALLEY. AND DANIELLE CANDLE KAISER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MR BELTRAME ALL. ARE YOU AVAILABLE FOR MISS. CANDLE KAISER. THANK YOU THIS IS A MEDICAL PROBLEM HERE. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MATT BELTRAME WELL I'M AN ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN THE ALAMEDA COUNTY DA'S OFFICE I SPEAK TODAY ON BEHALF OF OUR ELECTED DISTRICT ATTORNEY NANCY O'MALLEY IN SUPPORT OF AB THREE NINETY. I SERVED AS AN ATTORNEY IN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE FOR APPROXIMATELY TWENTY YEARS FOR TWELVE OF THOSE YEARS I'VE HANDLED CASES INVOLVING CONSUMER PROTECTION MATTERS THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE CASES INVOLVE COMPANIES LARGE AND SMALL THAT DO BUSINESS IN OUR STATE AND THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AMONG THE STATUTE THAT FREQUENTLY ARISE IS CALIFORNIA'S AUTOMATIC RENEWAL LAW. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF CONSUMER PROTECTION LEGISLATION AUTOMATIC RENEWAL CONTRACTS CAN BE TRAPS FOR THE UNWARY WHICH CAN RESULT IN MONTHS AND SOMETIMES YEARS OF UNNOTICED CREDIT CARD CHARGES THE A. R. L. REQUIRES COMPANIES THAT WISH TO ENTER INTO SUCH CONTRACTS WITH CONSUMERS TO MAKE CERTAIN DISCLOSURES ENTERTAIN AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT. MY COLLEAGUES AROUND THE STATE NOW I HAVE HANDLED DOZENS OF CIVIL INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVING VIOLATIONS OF THE A. R. L. THE MAJORITY OF THESE ACTIONS HAVE RESULTED IN STIPULATED COURT INJUNCTION MEANT TO SAFEGUARD CONSUMERS FROM AUTOMATIC REAL CONTRACTS. THAT DO NOT COMPLY WITH THE LAW. B. A. R. L. HAVE BEEN A REAL ASSET CONSUMER GETTING. CALIFORNIA'S ROLE AS A LEADER IN CONSUMER PROTECTION. D. A. R. L. AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN HOWEVER IS NOT PERFECT SOME HOMES REMAIN. FOR EXAMPLE NOTHING IN THE CURRENT LAW REQUIRES COMPANIES TO NOTIFY CONSUMERS WHEN THEY'RE ABOUT TO BE CHARGED EITHER AT THE END OF A FREE TRIAL PERIOD. OR AT THE TIME OF AN ANNUAL RENEWAL. SINCE THE VAST MAJORITY OF CONSUMER TRANSACTIONS THESE DAYS ARE COMPLETED ONLINE SUCH NOTIFICATIONS WOULD BE INEXPENSIVE AND EASY TO AUTOMATE. ALSO ALTHOUGH THE STATUTE IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN REQUIRES A COMPANY THAT OFFERS AN AUTO RENEW CONTRACT ONLINE TO ALLOW CANCELLATION ONLINE. WE'VE SEEN COMPANIES MAKE CANCELLATION TRICKY OR TIME CONSUMING AND REQUIRES CONSUMERS. TO JUMP THROUGH HOOPS TO STOP THE CHARGES. THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SUPPORT EIGHTY THREE NINETY BECAUSE IT STRENGTHENS ITS IMPORTANT STATUTE BY HELPING TO PLUG THE HOLES. FIRST IT REQUIRES THAT A BUSINESS WILL NOTIFY CUSTOMERS BEFORE THEIR CREDIT CARD IS CHARGED EITHER CONCLUSION. OF EVERY TRIAL PERIOD OF OVER THIRTY DAYS OR BEFORE AN ANNUAL RENEWAL PERIOD. GIVING CONSUMERS SUCH NOTICE WILL HELP AVOID CONFUSION AND THE SURPRISE THAT OFTEN ARISES WHEN BUSY CUSTOMERS FORGET THEY HAVE ENROLLED IN THE- BUILDING FROM PROGRAM THANK YOU SIR- THANK YOU MISS. DANIEL KIND OF KAISER YOU AVAILABLE.

FOR MUSIC STREAMING TO MEAL KIT TO DIETING AND FITNESS OUT MORE MORE CONSUMERS ARE SUBSCRIBING TO PRODUCT AND SERVICES ONLINE. AS THE STATE CONTINUES TO RECOVER FROM THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF CODE NINETEEN MANY CALIFORNIANS MUST FIND ADDITIONAL WAYS TO SAVE MONEY. DURING THE CHALLENGING TIMES IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT THAT CONSUMERS HAVE A CLEAR PATHWAY TO DISCONTINUING SERVICES THAT THEY AND THEIR FAMILIES NO LONGER LONGER NEED OR CAN'T AFFORD. THE COALITION CENTER THE LEGAL AID NEEDS THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS EVERY YEAR WE ARE KEENLY AWARE OF THE CURRENT RECESSION NECESSITATE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. THAT REVENT OUR MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS FROM FALLING FURTHER INTO DEBT AND FINANCIAL HARDSHIP.

IN RECENT YEARS FOOD DELIVERY COMPANIES HAVE AGGRESSIVELY ENTERED THE FOOD SERVICE SPACE MAKING PROMISES THAT THEY WILL GROW RESTAURANT REVENUES AND EVEN OFFERING LIMITED TIME DISCOUNTS TO GET RESTAURANTS TO JOIN. EXCHANGE FOR LISTING A RESTAURANT UNDER SERVICE AND PROVIDE A DELIVERY SERVICE RESTAURANTS PAY DELIVERY COMPANIES A COMMISSION ON THEIR SALES THESE COMMISSIONS AND FEES VERY. VERY RESTAURANT TO RESTAURANT WITH COMMISSION RATES FREQUENTLY REACHING AND EXCEEDING 30% OF THE PURCHASE PRICE. CONSUMERS ALSO PAY A VARIETY OF FEES FROM SPECIFIC LISTED DELIVERY FEES TO HIDDEN COSTS INFLATED MENU PRICES. TRANSPARENCY OF THE COST OF SERVICE WOULD HELP EMPOWER ALL PARTIES TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION. ABOUT WHICH ENTITIES TO PARTNER WITH AND PURCHASE FROM. TRANSPARENCY TO RESTAURANTS IS BENEFICIAL FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES PARTICULARLY TO HELP THEM DETERMINE THE OVERALL VALUE OF THE FOOD DELIVERY COMPANY BRINGS TO THE INDIVIDUAL RESTAURANT. FOR CONSUMERS TRANSPARENCY WILL ALLOW THEM TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW THE DOLLAR SUPPORT RESTAURANTS. AND THE WORKERS TO PROVIDE THEM THE FOOD AND DELIVERY SERVICE AND HOW MUCH GOES TO THE THIRD PARTY DELIVERY COMPANIES. A. B. TWENTY SIX WOULD SIMPLY PROVIDE A FACTUAL ITEMIZED COST BREAKDOWN OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED BOTH. TO CONSUMERS AND RESTAURANT OWNERS THIS WOULD INCLUDE MAKING SURE CHARGES OR FEES PAID TO THE THIRD PARTY ARE LISTED AS SUCH. RATHER THAN REFLECTED IN HIGHER MENU PRICES AND OF SET BY THE RESTAURANT WHICH CAN CAUSE CONSUMER CONFUSION. FURTHER MORE THIS BILL WILL ENSURE TIPS AND GRATUITIES ARE PAID TO THE DELIVERY DRIVER OR FOR PICK UP ORDERS TO THE FOOD FACILITY. HAVE WITNESSES ON THE PHONE- THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER I'D THAT MIKEY NAB IS THAT YOUR WITNESS OKAY- MIKEY NAP IF YOU'RE AVAILABLE YEAH THE FLOOR IS YOURS YES CAN YOU ALL HEAR ME WE CAN.

ARE AT- pBEEN EMPLOYING DESIGN PRACTICES THAT OBVIOUS GATE FEES. BUT ULTIMATELY IMPACTED FACILITIES PROFIT AND WORKER PAY. TRANSPARENCY IS HELPFUL TO EMPOWER BUSINESS OWNERS TO UNDERSTAND THE FULL SCOPE OF B. THEIR CUSTOMER HEY AND THEREBY MAKE. CLEAR DECISIONS ABOUT THE VALUE THAT THE THIRD PARTY DELIVERY COMPANY ACTUALLY PROVIDES YOUR BUSINESS. EMERGED OFF THE DESSERTS AND KNOW WHAT THEY'RE PAYING FOR. THE SERVICE TO BE A CHIP OR A MEAL. AND WHO THEY'RE PAYING FOR IT SO THEY CAN MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER AND HOW TO UTILIZE THE SERVICE. WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE SERVICES AFFECT THEIR WHOLE ECONOMY LOCALLY- FEATURE IS ONE OF MANY MECHANISMS AN ECOSYSTEM OF CHANGE THAT WE NEE IN ORDER TO FURTHER HOLD. THIRD PARTY DELIVERY COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE THE MANY STAKEHOLDERS TO RELY ON OUR SERVICES. THERE ARE CITIES LIKE LOS ANGELES CHICAGO AND WASHINGTON DC WASHINGTON DC SHOULD BE A STATE CURRENTLY THE CITY.

AS WELL AS A SIMILAR. I URGE DISCLOSURE FOR RIGHT- BUT WE JUST SPOKE THAT A THIRD PARTY DELIVERY COMPANY SHOULD HAVE TO DISCLOSE CONFIDENTIAL TERMS OF A PRIVATE BUSINESS TO BUSINESS CONTRACTS WHICH WE BELIEVE IS THE SPELL WITH THEIR- ALL THE P. THE FACILITY PAYS TO PAY FOR DELIVERY. HARMAR CALLING TERRY- AND ALSO CONFIDENTIAL AS PART OF THE CONTRACT IN FRONT- WHEN TREATED ISSUES TO PARTNER WITH A DOG POPCORN DAY PAGE HE'S NOT JUST FOR DELIVERY OR PICKUP SERVICE BUT FOR A WIDE RANGE OF OPTIONAL SERVICES AT ALL- SUCH AS ADVERTISING AND MARKETING- AND WE THINK. THIS GOES INTO SPECIFIC COMMISSION WILL USUALLY CUSTOMERS BECAUSE OF- COMMISSIONS PAID OR ARE NOT FOR THE DELIVERY HELLO- ADDITIONALLY YOU KNOW THIS THIS MARKET IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ON THE TRAIN FOR DELIVERY- COMPANIES. AND ALSO BETWEEN THIRD FACILITIES- YOU KNOW SOME. OFFERED DELIVERY USING OUR OWN STAFF POSITIONS TO PARTNER WITH COMPANIES LIKE OURS- AND THAT'S WHAT YOU CHOOSE TO PARTNER WITH A DELIVERY PLATFORM HAVE A WIDE VARIETY TO CHOOSE FROM AND EACH PLATFORM OFFERS. A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE. MADE TO MEET THEIR NEEDS- EXCEPT FOR THE TRINITARIANS RETENTION- THESE CONTRACTS SHOULD REMAIN PRIVATE- I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT WE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS- I WOULD BE HAPPY TO. DISCUSS WAYS TO PROVIDE GREATER TRANSPARENCY FOR EACH BUT THIS CROSSOVER REQUIREMENT. DOES GIVE US SOME CONCERN. FINALLY THIRD PARTY DELIVERY COMPANIES ALREADY PROVIDE A 100% OF CHIPS TO DRIVERS- AND WE- VOLUNTARILY REPRESENTATIVES CATCHER AS PART OF PROP TWENTY TWO- THIS REQUIREMENT CAN BE FOUND IN THE END HE CUT SECTION- SELLING FOR FIFTY THREE C. AND SO FOR THAT REASON- YOU KNOW WE THINK THE PROVISION. IN THE BILL REQUIRING THAT IS NOT NECESSARY TO COLLECTIVES- AND SHOULD BE STRICKEN BUT- NOT FOR THE REASONS WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. TO EIGHTY TWO EIGHTY SIX AND THREE TIMES.

LET ME CHECK REAL QUICK FOR YOU TO SEE IF I SEE THEM. YEAH I'VE I'VE I'M SORRY I DO NOT SEE A ROACH- ON THE CALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE CHAMBER QUESTIONS IN THE CHAMBER. SO THE COUPLE EURO. THANK YOU MR CHAIR- I WONDER IF THE AUTHOR COULD. ADDRESS THE ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION REGARDS TO THE BUSINESS TO BUSINESS CONTRACTS. THANK YOU SEVEN ORGANS ALICE. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO ENSURE THAT THE CUSTOMERS ARE AWARE OF THE FEES CHARGED TO RESTAURANTS- THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC IMPACT WE SAW A LOT OF. COMMERCIALS SUGGESTING HOW THESE THIRD PARTY DELIVERY APPS FOR KEEPING THESE RESTAURANTS UPLOAD AND ALTHOUGH TECHNICALLY THAT MIGHT BE TRUE A LOT OF CONSUMERS DON'T UNDERSTAND THE TRUE COST OF THAT A LOCAL RESTAURANT- MUST BEAR IN ORDER TO HAVE THE FOOD DELIVERED. WE THINK AS ESPECIALLY COMING OUT OF THE PANDEMIC FOR CONSUMERS TO MAKE EDUCATED AND WISE DECISIONS TO SUPPORT LOCAL RESTAURANTS HAVING THAT INFORMATION WILL HELP THEM MAKE A DECISION ON IF THEY ARE SUPPORTING. A RESTAURANT BY HAVING DELIVERY OR PERHAPS JUST GOING THEMSELVES TO PICK IT UP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT ANSWER I GUESS I THOUGHT THE BILL I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT TO SAY THAT I SUPPORT THE BILL I'M GONNA VOTE FOR TODAY. BUT I- I. I THOUGHT THE BILL WAS A TRANSPARENCY BILL. IN REGARDS TO THE CONSUMER AND HOW MUCH OF CONSUMERS PAYING AND WHETHER IT'S REALLY BENEFITING IN THE RESTAURANT. IF A RESTAURANT DECIDES THAT THEY WANT TO GO WITH THAT PARTICULAR SERVICE. AND IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE OTHERS BUT THE DELIVERY IS BETTER. AND THE FOOD ACTUALLY GETS THERE FASTER WHICH IS. MEAN THAT'S ONE OF THE ONE OF THE BENEFITS FOR ME IS THAT IF THE FOOD GETS THERE AND IT'S BEEN ON ITS WAY FOR HALF AN HOUR IT'S JUST NOT AS GOOD AS IF IT'S IF IT. ARRIVES RIGHT AWAY- IF. I GUESS I THOUGHT THAT THE ISSUE. WITH THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL WAS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT WHICH IS WHY I ASKED THE QUESTION. BECAUSE IT T SEEMS TO ME IF YOU HAVEA BUSINESS TO BUSINESS CONTRACT- RELATIONSHIP. IT'S MUCH MORE. EQUAL THAN A CONSUMER THAT HAS TO TAKE THAT PARTICULAR. SERVICE AND THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT. AND AND IT MAY BE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THEY THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE. HI I AM I AM. I APPRECIATE WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS AND- I GUESS I JUST FEEL LIKE- I. THE BUSINESS TO BUSINESS HAS LESS OF A RELATIONSHIP TO THE- CUSTOMER AND THEN. WHAT I WILL PAY AS A CUSTOMER. IN ANY CASE I'M GONNA SUPPORT IT FINANCIALLY MEMBER CONSULTS YOU COULD RESPOND RESPOND CLOSELY AND TRANSPARENCY COULD BE FOR A LOT OF REASONS RIGHT SO WE WANT THE RESTAURANTS TO HAVE TRANSPARENCY- THERE IT THIS ISN'T VERY COMPETITIVE MARKET BACK THERE I THINK. THREE COMPANIES HAVE 95% MARKET SHARE. AND SO- WE WANT RESTAURANTS ESPECIALLY IN REALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS SMALL MOM AND POP RESTAURANTS HAVE NOW ENTERED CONTRACTS INTO THESE DELIVERY SERVICES. FOR THE PURE SURVIVAL AND NOW WITH VERY MUCH LIKE THEIR CUSTOMERS TO RETURN- AND IN ORDER TO DO SO I THINK WE NEED SOME- ACCURATE ACCOUNTING OF. OF THE SITUATION THEY'RE IN. SORRY THANK YOU THANK YOU- CENTER BORDERS. THE RESEARCHER. I'VE SUPPORTED- I THINK ONE OF YOUR BILLS WAS LAST YEAR MAYBE ONE YEAR BEFORE ON- TRANSPARENCY EFFORTS WHEN IT COMES TO FOOD DELIVERY SERVICE. THIS BILL HOWEVER I THINK IT'S DIFFERENT THAN SOME OF THE MATERIAL THAT YOU'VE WORKED ON IN THE PAST. ONE BECAUSE I THINK. HOW MUCH MONEY THESE TWO PRIVATE PARTIES ARE CONTRACTING FOR SENSHI BECOMES PRIVILEGED OR PROPRIETARY. AND TO FORCE THE DISCLOSURE OF THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION. IT'S NOT THAT I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF IT'S TRULY IN THE INTEREST OF THE CONSUMER BUT MORE TOWARDS THE NOTION THAT. YOU WANT TO- DEMONSTRATE THE INFLATIONARY ADJUSTMENTS OF FOOD DELIVERY SERVICE- AND DISCOURAGE THOSE FOLKS. FROM CONTINUING TO USE THAT OUR FOOD DELIVERY SERVICE IN OPT INSTEAD FOR EMPLOYEES WHO MIGHT DELIVER IT FOR THEM SO- FURTHER ON BEHALF OF THE RESTAURANT OR ENCOURAGE FOLKS COME BACK IN. SO EVEN THOUGH I'VE SUPPORTED YOUR EFFORTS IN THE PAST THIS ONE I JUST I CAN'T BUY INTO. ONLY BECAUSE IF WE WERE TO. MAKE AN EXAMPLE. YOU KNOW DO I HAVE A RIGHT TO ASK A RESTAURANT. YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IT IT PURCHASES ITS SUPPLIES FROM A PARTICULAR DISTRIBUTOR. AND THEY TELL ME TO POUND SAND. I'D BE LIKE NO BUT THAT'S THE TYPE OF TRANSPARENCY THAT I WANT BECAUSE I WANT TO KNOW IF I SHOULD KEEP IN FREQUENT YOUR ESTABLISHMENT. THERE'S CERTAIN BUSINESS TO BUSINESS CONFIDENTIALITY THAT MUST EXIST. IF YOU EXPOSE EVERYTHING TO THE LIGHT OF DAY. THEN I THINK THE OLD THE ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE IS MAKING CERTAIN THAT THE COMPETITORS KNOW WHAT'S AT PLAY. CARDS ACTUALLY DRIVE DOWN- THE COMPETITIVE MARKET PLACE IN ULTIMATELY EXPOSE THE PRINCIPLES. ARE IN DRIVE THEM AWAY FROM USING FOOD DELIVERY SERVICE SO IF. IF WE'RE INTERESTED IN THE IN PROMOTING PRIVATE ENTERPRISE AND- IN FREE ENTERPRISE- THIS I THINK IS JUST A BRIDGE TOO FAR RESPECTFULLY- AND A UNITED- MAY HAVE PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCES EVEN THOUGH WE'VE HAD A LOT OF COMMON GROUND IN THE PAST. THIS IS JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS HERE. GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT HAVE A ROLE IN FORCING THE DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION. BETWEEN TWO PRIVATE CONTRACTING PARTIES ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S VOLUNTARY. IF THE SMALL MOM AND POP BELIEVES YOU'RE PAYING TOO MUCH. TO FOOD DELIVERY SERVICE FOR WHAT IS ACTUALLY WHAT WHAT PRODUCT IS BEING DELIVERED. THEY HAVE EVERY REASON TO STOP DOING. AND FOR GOVERNMENT TO STEP IN AND IN THESE VERY INTIMATE LEVELS OF ENTERPRISE I THINK IT'S JUST TOO FAR. THANK YOU SEVERAL BOARD JUST ASSUME MEMBER GONZALEZ DO YOU CARE TO RESPOND NOW OR IN YOUR CLOSING OR THE MICROPHONES RAISED I'D BE HAPPY TO RESPOND NOW I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE MY PREVIOUS MANAGER ACTUALLY ALSO POSED BY THESE COMPANIES WAS TO REQUIRE THAT THERE BE A CONTRACT BETWEEN THE RESTAURANT AND THE FOOD DELIVERY COMPANY. IN ORDER FOR THE FOOD DELIVERY COMPANY TO AT. TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE- THE STATE DOES HAVE A REASONABLE INTEREST IN INFORMING CONSUMERS AND BEEN BUSINESS SAYS OF THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP PARTICULARLY IN THE- ORIGINS AND DESTINATIONS THEIR MONEY IN THE SCOPE OF A BUSINESS TRANSACTION. I'D EVEN ARGUE FURTHER NUMBER ONE THIS IS IN PLACE IN CERTAIN CITIES ARE READY. SO IT'S NOT. THE FIRST UP WE ACTUALLY TOOK IT FROM OTHER- LANGUAGE AND IN. METRO AREAS- BUT I'D ALSO ARGUE THIS. THIS IS A UNIQUE SITUATION RIGHT WE HAVE COMPANIES QUITE FRANKLY. THAT SOLD THE PUBLIC- ON THEIR GENERAL BENEFIT TO THE PUBLIC- WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN TRUE. THEY ARE COMPANIES THAT BECAUSE THEIR BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS- AND BECAUSE THE WAY THEY CONDUCT BUSINESS WE AS TAXPAYERS ARE ACTUALLY SUBSIDIZING- THEIR WORKFORCE. SO I THINK IT'S IMPERATIVE FOR- GENERAL EDUCATION OF CONSUMERS TO UNDERSTAND THE EXACT NATURE. OF HOW MUCH MONEY IS BEING- TAKEN IN BY THESE COMPANIES. BLESSED HOW MUCH IS ACTUALLY BEING PAID TO THE DRIVERS QUITE FRANKLY ON THAT'S A DIFFERENT DISCUSSION. BUT BUT- TO KNOW THAT- DELIVER IS NOT FREE RIGHT I MEAN THIS NOTION THAT THAT SOMEHOW. SOME COMPANY IS PAIN HEY'RE NOT PAIN BY THE WAY- YOU KNOW MINIMUM WAGE OR OR THE EVEN REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY- THEY PROVIDED POP TWENTY TWO I THINK FULL DISCLOSURE SOMETHING THAT- WE AS CONSUMERS DESERVE ESPECIALLY WHEN WE AS CONSUMERS ARE ALSO WE AS VOTERS. ANDHAVE BEEN- ADVERTISED AS SUCH A YOU KNOW WE WERE ADVERTISED WITH A GOOD PRODUCT AS WELL AS HOW HOW GOOD THEY ARE FOR RESTAURANTS HOW GOOD THEY ARE FOR THEIR DRIVERS AND I THINK. HAVING DISCLOSURE ON BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS WHERE OUR MONEY IS GOING IT IS A FAIR. A NEXT STEP. BUT AGAIN AS YOU SAID WE CAN AGREE TO DISAGREE. ALL RIGHTY THANK YOU. IS THAT COMPLETE YOUR COMMENTS ON OUR BORDERS. WHAT THE HELL FOLLOW UP BY MAINLY BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS A THAT WAS A CLOSING THERE THERE ARE SOME MERITS I BELIEVE TO WHAT TO WHAT- THE AUTHOR- PUT PUT FORWARD. PLASTERERS COUPLE WEEKS AGO I- LOVE THIS THIS FANTASTIC INDIAN PLACE IN- IN FRESNO. IN DURING COATED. WE WOULD USE THE DELIVERY SERVICES. WELL THE PRICES I WAS IN THE POSITION NOW TO FIGURE OUT THE REAL DISTINCTION. AND I WAS DISINCLINED TO ACTUALLY GO FOR THE FOOD DELIVERY SERVICE BECAUSE IT WAS THAT MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE. BUT THAT'S MY CHOICE. AS A AS AS AS AS A CONSUMER BUT I DON'T HAVE A RIGHT BY. BY VIRTUE OF LEGISLATION. TO PRY INTO THE DISTINCTIONS OF THE TWO PARTIES I CAN MAKE A DECISION. THAT IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE OR I PREFER TO DO TAKEOUT BUT TO FORCE THESE INDIVIDUALS TO DISCLOSE PROPRIETARY INFORMATION ON THEIR RELATIONSHIP. IS WELL BEYOND THE REALM OF THE STATE AND EVEN THOUGH THERE MAY BE OTHER JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE SIMILAR- PROGRAMS IN PLACE I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO FIND THAT BY AND LARGE IT'S CITIES OR OR METRO COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE STRONG LABOR INTERESTS WHICH IS REALLY WHAT THIS IS ABOUT IT'S NOT ONSUMER TRANSPARENCY I THINK THIS IS A STRONG- MOVEMENT IN THE DIRECTION. OF ORGANIZED- LABOR AND STANDARDS AND EXPECTATIONS OF THE WORK FORCE BUT I RESPECT THE WORK EVEN THE FOUNTAIN AND NOT EVEN SUPPORTED THAT THAT BILL PRYOR SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR EXPLANATION WELL I JUST WANNA BE CLEAR DESPITE MY STRONG INTEREST TOWARDS LABOR ON THIS BILL IN THE IDEAS OF THIS WHOLE APPROACH ME IMPACT BY SMALL RESTAURANT OWNERS AND IN MY DISTRICT AND SO FORTH TALKED ABOUT PROPRIETARY INFORMATION THE TRUTH IS THIS AND THIS WE KNOW FROM FROM ANOTHER BACKGROUND IS MCDONALD'S PAYS FAR LESS- IN DELIVERY FEES THAN YOUR LOCAL MOM AND POP DOES- YOU KNOW THERESTAURANT ITSELF THE PURCHASE. PRICE FOR THE RESTAURANT BECAUSE OF THE OF THE SCALE OF IT AND I THINK CONSUMERS WOULD WANT TO KNOW THAT I WOULD WANT TO DISTINGUISH BE ABLE TO BE EDUCATED CONSUMERS IF YOU ASK RESTAURANT OFTEN TELL YOU HOW MUCH THEIR PAIN AND- QUITE FRANKLY IT'S DISCOURAGING THANK YOU SENT. A SIMILAR MEMBER GONZALEZ SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MR CHAIR I JUST I JUST WANT. A QUICK COMMENT AND THAT I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME- D. THE AUTHORS NOT JUST THE PRESENTATION THE BILL BUT THE COLLEGE WE HAD HERE THING WAS. ILLUMINATING AND I AND I JUST. THIS THIS NOTION THAT SOMEHOW- FEED DISCLOSURE SERVICE FEE DISCLOSURE WOULD BE SEEN AS ANTI COMPETITIVE OR SOMEHOW UNDERCUTTING- YOU KNOW BUSINESS PROPRIETARY INFORMATION TO ME IT IT THERE'S SO MANY OTHER SECTORS WHERE WE REQUIRE. SERVICE FEES AND COMMISSION DISCLOSURES THIS IS NOT I DON'T THINK WE'RE BREAKING SOME DRAMATIC NEW GROUND HERE IN FACT AND IT AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT GROUND BREAK BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S NEW GROUND- AND SO YOU KNOW I THINK ABOUT. OTHER MAJOR TRANSACTIONS WE MAKE BUYING CARS FOR- YOU KNOW GOING THROUGH- VARIES IN THE RETAIL TRANSACTIONS THAT OCCUR- SO I THINK I DON'T SEE THIS AS PARTICULARLY REVOLUTIONARY CONTROVERSIAL BUT JUST A MATTER OF SIMPLE TRANSPARENCY AND CONSUMER JUSTICE AND- HI YOU KNOW I JUST THIS WHOLE LANDSCAPE AND GROWING UP WORKING IN LOCAL RESTAURANTS AND SEEING WHAT A STRUGGLE IT IS TO SURVIVE AND SEEING HOW MANY PEOPLE THAT I KNOW.

AND MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THE TIME ALL RIGHT BUT LET'S NOT TURN TO. THE OPPOSITION HI I HAVE A MISTER JASON I CARED AND MR CHRIS WYSOCKI- I SEE. SIR GO AHEAD. MEMBERS AND CHASE AND I AGREE WITH THAT- STEAM GILBERT ROZON SMITH ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS ALLIANCE REGRETTABLY ESSIE NPA REMAINS IN OPPOSITION TO AB TEN SIXTY ONE AND I SAY REGRETTABLY BECAUSE WE AGREE WITH THE BASIC NOTION THAT A RESIDENT IN A MOBILE HOME PARK SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY MORE FOR WATER SERVICE THAN THEY WOULD IF THEY WERE SERVED DIRECTLY BY WATER UTILITY. THE ISSUE WITH AB TEN SIXTY ONE IS THAT IT PROHIBITS A PART OWNER FROM RECOVERING A FIXED COST OF SERVICES AT THE SAME RATE THAT'S BEEN SET BY A UTILITY AND PARKS DEFINITELY HAVE FIXED COST MEMBERS IN A PARK UNLIKE AN APARTMENT YOU HAVE A WHOLE WATER SYSTEM THAT STRETCHES BEHIND YOUR MASTER METER TO DELIVER WATER ACROSS THE PARK THERE MEANS. BEAR UNDER A ROSE IN THE PARK EXCAVATING THEM FOR OPERATIONS MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR IT'S POSSIBLY. AND THE WAY THAT THE PARK IS ALLOWED TO RECOVER THESE COSTS TODAY IS TO LOOK TO THE LOCAL UTILITY. SEE HOW THEY HAVE SENT THEIR CHARGES FOR COVERING THEIR FIXED COSTS. AND USE THAT AND KNOW MORE AS A BENCHMARK FOR WHAT THE PARK IS ALLOWED TO RECOVER. AND SO AGAIN. THOSE ARE THOSE ARE CHARGES THAT WOULD BE PAID BY A RESIDENT IF THEY WERE SERVED DIRECTLY BY UTILITY THEY'RE PAID BY ALL OF YOUR OTHER CONSTITUENTS WHO ARE LIVING IN SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. AND THEY ARE NOT SET BY THE PARK ITSELF WE DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER IT UNDER THE LAW SO WE BELIEVE THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO GO. BUT THIS BILL PROHIBITS IT WOULDN'T KNOW WHETHER A MECHANISM IN PLACE FOR RECOVERY OF COST. AND YOU. IF YOU ARE IN A RENT CONTROLLED JURISDICTION YOU ARE AT THE MERCY OF A LOCAL RENT CONTROL BOARD WITH NO EXPERTISE IN WATER SERVICE. WHEN YOU GO TO THEM AND ASK THEM TO ALLOW YOU TO RECOVER THIS. THAT'S ESPECIALLY PROBLEMATIC FOR PARKS THE TWENTY YEARS AGO. MADE A CHOICE TO REDUCE THEIR RENT. TO REFLECT THE FACT THAT THEY WOULD BE BILLING SEPARATELY FOR UTILITY SERVICE. LASTLY MEMBERS THERE IS A CONSERVATION ISSUE IN THIS BILL. WE METER AND SUB METER WATER SERVICE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE IT ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO USE LESS WATER. IF PARTS ARE NOT ALLOWED FULL COST RECOVERY. NO OTHER MOBILE HOME PARK GOING FORWARD IF THIS BILL PASSES. WILL I CHOOSE TO SUB METERED WATER SERVICE AND SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS. WE REMAIN IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THERE ARE WAYS TO FIX IT WE DISCUSSED IT WITH YOUR STAFF. AND ALL OF YOUR STAFF AND WE CONTINUE TO BE WILLNG TO- AND LESS ADDRESSED- WE MUST REMAIN FOCUSED AND REQUEST YOU KNOW PLEASE. THANK YOU MR. OCCURRED MR WYSOCKI. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS- MY NAME'S CHRIS WYSOCKI NUMBER PRESENTING THE WESTERN MANUFACTURED HOUSING COMMUNITIES ASSOCIATION. RESPECTFULLY WE MUST RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL EVEN THOUGH THE BILLS GOT SOME POTENTIAL AMENDMENTS WE REMAIN OPPOSED FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS. FIRST WIN AB TEN SIXTY ONE WAS INITIALLY DRAFTED IT SOUGHT TO CODIFY A P. U. C. DECISION THAT NOBODY COULD PROFIT FROM WATER. WE ASKED FOR ONE SIMPLE CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS. AND THAT WAS TO ALLOW THOSE DELIVERING WATER TO GET REIMBURSED FOR THAT SERVICE NO MORE NO LESS. THAT SUGGESTION WAS NOT ACCEPTED THE MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS HAVE BEEN SENT ME DURING WATER AND PARKS FOR DECADES DOING THE RIGHT THING TRYING TO HELP CONSERVE WATER AND HELP RAISE THAT RESIDENTS SAVE MONEY. BY AMENDING LANGUAGE INTO THIS BILL FROM S. B. SEVEN. THAT WAS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THIS BILL SEEKS TO TREAT MOBILE HOME PARKS LIKE APARTMENT BUILDINGS. MOBILE HOME PARKS ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM APARTMENTS AND THEIR WATER SYSTEMS ARE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE TO MAINTAIN. FURTHER SB SEVEN WAS PROSPECTING AND IT WAS INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE APARTMENT BUILDINGS TO INSTALL SEVEN YEARS THIS BILL APPLIES RETROACTIVELY TO ALL PARKS APPLYING ONE ROTARY ACROSS THE BOARD FOR THE ENTIRE STATE. ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL WE BELIEVE FURTHER INTERFERES WITH INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES HAVE CPUC APPROVED WATER DELIVERY RATES. THIS BILL SHOULD AT LEAST BE AMENDED TO GRANDFATHER IN APPROVED WATER PROVIDER RATES. ADDITIONALLY WE QUESTION WHY LOCAL RENT CONTROL BOARDS WILL BE IN CHARGE OF DETERMINING WATER CHARGES WHEN DECIDING ON RENT INCREASES AS MISTER REICHARDT POINTED OUT. IF WATER CHARGES ARE INCORPORATED IN IRAN. HOW DOES THAT INCREASE THE TRANSPARENCY THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS FOR RESIDENTS. IF THIS BILL CURRENTLY PASSES IT WILL DISCOURAGE FUTURE SUB METERING OF MOBILE HOME PARKS A POLICY THAT SEEMS TO RUN COUNTER TO OUR STATEWIDE GOALS. TO CARVE WATER WHENEVER POSSIBLE THANK YOU FOR THOSE I KNOW THE REASONS WE REMAIN OPPOSED THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU SIR- ALL RIGHT OTHERS IN OPPOSITION THE GALLERY SEEING NO ONE ROOM ONE TWELVE SAYING NO ONE LET'S TURN TO THE PHONE LINE MR MODERATOR CAN. QUEUE UP THOSE OPPOSED. TO AB ONE ZERO SIX ONE. FOUR COMMENTS IN OPPOSITION TO AB ONE ZERO SIX ONE. PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. COMMAND AGAIN. ONE ZERO. IN A LINE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY YOU'RE MY KID UP. MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS- MY NAME IS MAURICE PRIEST. AND AS YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN A HOMEOWNER- ADVOCATE AND ADVOCATE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR OVER FORTY YEARS- I AM TESTIFYING TODAY ON BEHALF OF OUR NON PROFIT ASSOCIATION AFFORDABLE COMMUNITIES INC. WE DO OWN AND MANAGE TEN MOBILE HOME COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE BENEFIT OF LOW INCOME SENIORS AND FAMILIES- I MUST OPPOSE. AB TEN SIXTY ONE AND I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES WE OF MR PLACE MR PRE SEVERAL. OUR MISTER PRIEST YES I WE APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR YOUR POINT OF VIEW BUT THERE THERE'S ALREADY BEEN TWO WITNESSES WHO TESTIFIED IN FAVOR- SO. I UNDERSTAND YOUR POSITION I THINK YOU ARE IN SUPPORT. ON BEHALF OF BUT I KNOW WE'RE WE'RE IN WE'RE ON SIGNAGE AND MISTER CHAIRMAN OKAY ALL RIGHT. B. WARY OF ID NOT APOLOGIZE ADDITION TO THE BILL I APOLOGIZE OKAY THANK YOU SIR. ALL RIGHT. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. LINE AT. ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE. YES GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MICHAEL CIRILLO I AM WITH THE STAR MANAGEMENT COMPANY WE OPERATE A NUMBER OF MOBILE HOME PARKS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO AB TEN SIXTY ONE. THANK YOU. A LINE OF. ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO. YES THIS IS LAWRENCE MACKEY DO WITH BUSH CARMACK THE WAY ON FIVE PARK IN ORANGE COUNTY AND I'M IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO AB TEN SIXTY ONE. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THIS TIME ALL RIGHT. BRING IT BACK TO THE CHAMBER QUESTIONS- CYNICAL EUROS QUESTION. THANK YOU MR CHAIR- I WAS WONDERING IF THE- IF THE AUTHOR COULD RESPOND TO THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION IN PARTICULAR THAT KIND OF FIXED COSTS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN THAT. WOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM BEING RECOUPED AS PART OF THIS BILL. YES SOMEONE WILL GO AHEAD THANK YOU SIR FOR THE QUESTION I MEAN DEFER TO BRUCE STAND. THE LEGAL COUNSEL WHICH IS OFTEN A QUESTION. YEAH I'D BE HAPPY TO TRY TO RESPOND IT IS THE ISSUE HERE IS REALLY JUST A LACK OF REGULATION. AS LONG AS THE PARK OWNER CHARGES THE SAME VOLUMETRIC RATE AS IT PAYS AS THE WATER PURVEYOR AUTHORIZES THE CPUC HAS NO JURISDICTION AND THAT THERE IS NO REGULATION. REGARDING THIS RECURRING FIXED CHARGE ISSUES SUCH AS THE CUSTOMER CHARGES THAT ARE BEING REPLICATED THROUGHOUT THE PARKS. AND SO THE RESIDENTS REALLY HAVE NO REMEDY IF THOSE CHARGES ARE INCORRECT OR IF THEY'RE JUST RAISING CONTINUE TO BE REPLICATED. SO THE PROBLEM HERE IS IN THE FAR CORNER HERE SAYING WELL WE NEED THIS COST TO MAINTAIN THE INFRASTRUCTURE. BUT IN FACT WHAT HAPPENS IS MANY PARK OWNERS WILL CHARGE THE RESIDENT TO INSTALL THE METERS WHEN WATER IS FOR SENATOR. THEN THE REPLICATING THE CUSTOMER CHARGE THAT THEY'RE NOT ACCOUNTING FOR IT THERE'S NO REGULATION THAT SAYS YOU HAVE TO BANK BACK CUSTOMER CHARGE OR OTHERWISE. THAT COUNT FOR HER BUT SHE'S ACCUMULATED. AND THEN WHEN THERE IS A REPAIR OR MAINTENANCE ISSUE WITH THE SYSTEM THE PARKING IS FREE. TO PASS THAT THROUGH TO RESIDENTS AS A CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT AND THAT TYPICALLY HAPPENS BASED UPON. WHAT LEASES AUTHORIZE VERY COMMONLY OR- IN LOCAL RENT CONTROL JURISDICTIONS THERE ARE MANY TIMES SEPARATE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PASS THROUGH PROVISIONS THAT ALLOW. ANY KIND OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURE TO BE REIMBURSED SO REALLY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH RANCH- IT'S ALL ABOUT A CAPITAL EXPENDITURE CHARGE. PROBABLY FOR YOU AT THE PARK UNDER GETS TO REPLICATE THIS CUSTOMER CHARGE EVERY STATE AND I'M NOT ACCOUNTABLE AT. THE PARK AND JEFF COLLECTING NOT ONLY THIS CUSTOMER CHARGE BUT ALSO CAN GO COLLECT. THE CAPITAL COST TO REPAIR OR MAINTAIN THE INFRASTRUCTURE. I THINK THE CUSTOMER CHARGES CERTAINLY INTENDED FROM THE SERVING UTILITY OR WATER PURVEYORS POINT IF YOU COULD BE A BETTER STRANGERS COSTS- AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL. AS WE YOU KNOW TOOK THE PROVISIONS OF THE FORMER SP SEVEN IS ALLOWED TO PARK ON. YOUR RECUPERATED MINISTRATION COSTS BUT NOT TO REPLICATE THE CUSTOMER. CHARGE WERE- NON RECURRING FIXED CHARGES WERE ACTUALLY A RECURRING FIXED CHARGES. THAT THE WATER PURVEYOR CHARGES AND I ANSWERED THE QUESTION. HEY YOU PROBABLY HAVE I CAN'T SAY THAT I FOLLOWED IT TOTALLY ME JUST SAY THAT. TO THE EXTENT I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IN THIS BILL. THIS IS THE SECOND HOUSE IF THERE'S GONNA BE ANY CHANGES TO THE BILL THIS IS THE TIME TO DO IT AND THAT THE THING THAT I FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT IS THAT WHAT WE WANT IS SEPARATE METERING. ON ALL RESIDENCES AND THAT INCLUDES MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS SO THAT PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THEY'RE USING. AND WHEN WE ASK PEOPLE TO REDUCE. THEIR CONSUMPTION TO CONSERVE THEY HAVE A WAY TO BE ABLE T DETERMINE WHETHER THEY'RE DOING A GOOD JOB OR NOT IT'S A AS AN EXAMPLE. HERE IN SACRAMENTO THE RESIDENTS THAT I'VE BEEN LIVING IN USED TO BE A FLAT FEET BASICALLY FIFTY BUCKS. A MONTH FOR THE WATER AND THERE USED TO BE WATER RUNNING DOWN THE CURB IN FRONT OF MY RESIDENCE. EVERY SINGLE DAY FROM SOMEONE ELSE. UP THE STREET WHO WAS PROBABLY ALSO PAYING FIFTY BUCKS WHEN IT FINALLY GOT METERED MY BILL WENT DOWN TO BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS TO THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH. SO I'M ASSUMING THAT THERE IS WIND UP. SIGNIFICANTLY BECAUSE THEY WERE WASTING WATER WE WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW WHEN THEY'RE WASTING WATER AND TO CONSERVE. AND SO IN IN THIS SCENARIO I AGREE WITH THE OPPONENTS AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO DISCOURAGE. B. EXPENDITURE OF INFRASTRUCTURE MONEY TO SEPARATELY METER EVERYTHING WHICH IS STATE LINE WHICH WE WANT THEM TO DO. AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE SETTING UP. AN A. STRUCTURE- IT SEEMS ONLY FAIR TO ALLOW THOSE- PARK OWNERS THAT HAVE BEEN PROGRESSIVE AND GONE OUT AND DONE THE WORK. TO BE ABLE TO RECOUP. THAT INVESTMENT THAT THEY MADE IN THE PARK. AND AND CHARGER FEE WHICH THEY THEN CAN PUT IN A SEPARATE ACCOUNT. AND END USE IT ONLY. TO MAKE UPGRADES IN TO FIX THE SYSTEM- CAPITAL COSTS TO THE SYSTEM AND AN ACCOUNT FOR IT TO THE BENEFIT OF THE TENANT SO I GET TO THE EXTENT THAT. THAT YOU'RE CHANGING THE SYSTEM AND THEN YOU'RE CREATING THIS NEW SYSTEM. TO ME IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IT IT MAKES SENSE TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW THEM TO. TO RECOUP SOME OF THE COST IN IN IN THIS INFRASTRUCTURE AND TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT PROVIDES NOTICE TO THE TENANTS AND AT THE ABILITY FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW HOW MUCH MONEY IS IN THIS ACCOUNT. AND FRANKLY THAT IF THE MONEY GETS TO BE SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH THAT THAT THAT CHARGE NO LONGER NEEDS TO BE INCLUDED AS PART OF THAT OF THE WATER WATER FREE SO. I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT- I JUST THINK THAT IT'S THAT THERE'S A FAIRNESS ISSUE HERE AND- WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE INCENTIVIZING PEOPLE TO DO THE RIGHT THING WHICH IS TO PUT IN THE SEPARATE METERS. THANKS THANK YOU SENATOR CAFIERO. A SORT OF LIKE ASKING. RESEARCHER I'M ON PAGE SEVEN OF THE STAFF ALICE'S AND I THOUGHT. THE AMENDMENT THAT THE AUTHORS TAKING. INDICATES THAT NOTHING IN THIS SECTION SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO PREVENT MANAGEMENT. FROM RECOVERING ITS COSTS INSTALL MAINTAIN OR IMPROVE. INTERNAL WATER DELIVERY SYSTEM AS MAY OTHERWISE BE ALLOWED IN ANY RENTAL AGREEMENT OR LOCAL REGULATION. SO WOULDN'T THE RUB. B. IS IF THE RENTAL AGREEMENT WAS SILENT ON OR SOME LOCAL. CONTRIBUTE RENT CONTROL SAID OR OR LOCAL ORDINANCE SAID AND MOBILE HOME PARKS YOU CAN ONLY CHARGE. FIVE DOLLARS FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT WOULD LIMIT VERSES WHICH WHAT THE- PARK OWNERS GOTTA PAY THE BANK TO FINANCE WHATEVER IT WAS THEY COULD IMPROVE MY WRONG AND THEN. LET ME ASK THE AUTHOR TO RESPOND. I'M GOING TO DEFER IT TO MY SPONSOR YES I. IN SHORT I DON'T THINK YOU'RE WRONG CENTER WE KNOW SKI BUT- IF MR STAND WHICH IS A RESPONSE. YEAH I WOULD AGREE MISTER CHAIR- CENTER WORKOUTS SKI IS NOT WRONG- MANY LONG TERM LEASES AS WE HAVE CALLED THEM THREE YEARS HAVE VERY SPECIFIC CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT OUR CAPITAL REPLACEMENT CAPITAL EXPENSE PROVISIONS IN THOSE DOCUMENTS. AND ANY RENT CONTROL ANY LOCAL RENT STABILIZATION ORDINANCE SHOULD BE CONSTITUTIONAL MUST ALLOW FOR DUE PROCESS. TO OCCUR HEARING PROCESS FOR ANYONE INCREASED AGAIN MANY OF THEM VERY SPECIFICALLY HAVE SEPARATE CAPITAL EXPENDITURE PASS THROUGH PROCEEDINGS THAT ARE DOWN. ON SPECIFIC. ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS THAT DON'T REQUIRE THE PARKED OPEN ALL THE BOOKS IT'S JUST REQUIRED TO PROVE THAT A- ENCOURAGED THAT CAPITAL EXPENSE SO THAT'S WHY WE HAD THAT LANGUAGE ADDED TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THOSE RAPID USE THAT PARK OWNERS HAVE ALREADY BEEN USING. ARE STILL STILL IN PLAY. SAID IT'S YOUR QUESTIONS IN WHAT ELSE HE DOES ALL RIGHT SIR JONES YOUR MICROPHONE UP. IT WAS THAT I HAD A SECOND QUESTION. THAT YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR MICROPHONE IS NOT ON. AS THE WE COULD TURN ON CENTER JONES'S MICROPHONE. TRUST ME IT'S NOT INTENTIONAL SYNERGIZE. WE NOW KNOW.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS IT'S A PLEASURE TO PRESENT TODAY ON THIS RED FLOOR AND- AS THE SENATE JUDICIARY CHAIR FOR MORE DISCOUNTING MR AMBER- TODAY I AM PRESENTING AB NINE SEVENTY EIGHT I ENTERED THIS THIS BILL IN AN EFFORT TO BUILD UPON THE IMPORTANT POLICY DISCUSSIONS THAT TOOK PLACE IN TWENTY NINETEEN RELATED TO RENT STABILIZATION BY EXTENDING THEM TO MOBILE HOME PARK. RESIDENTS JUST AS RESIDENT JUST HAVE AS RENTS HAVE DRAMATICALLY INCREASED STATE WIDE MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS ARE ALSO FACING DRASTIC RENT INCREASES FROM PARK OWNERS. HOWEVER MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING RENT INCREASES INCREASES FIND THEMSELVES IN A VERY DIFFERENT SITUATIONS. MOBILE HOME OWNERS JUST LIKE TRADITIONAL HOME OWNERS PAY MORTGAGE ON THE HOME. BUT MOST MUST ALSO PAY FOR REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE AS WELL AS HOME TAXES HOWEVER UNLIKE TRADITIONAL HOMEOWNERS THEY MUST ALSO BUDGET FOR RENT. AS WE KNOW MOBILE HOMES ARE NOT MOBILE EIGHTY NINE SEVENTY EIGHT WAS NARROWED SIGNIFICANTLY TO ADDRESS OPPOSITION AND DISCUSSION WITHIN THIS COMMITTEE. THERE IS A MOBILE HOME PARK IN MY DISTRICT RANCHO LOVE THE PLUS WHERE THE RESIDENTS OF THE PARK ARE SPLIT BETWEEN THE TWO CITIES OF FULLERTON AND ANAHEIM. THIS BILL ONLY FOCUSES ON RANCHO LOOK BECAUSE- THESE RESIDENTS ARE MY CONSTITUENTS AND FIND THEMSELVES IN A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION SINCE A NEW POLL PARK OWNER TOOK OVER IN TWENTY NINETEEN. RESIDENTS OF THIS PARK HAVE BEEN HIT WITH BACK TO BACK DOUBLE DIGIT. I'M GONNA REPEAT THAT DOUBLE DIGIT RENT INCREASES AND EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE TRIED TO GET THIS ISSUE RESOLVED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THE LOCAL CITY COUNCILS TO DATE THEY HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY REPRIEVE. WELL I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO RUN A STATEWIDE BILL TO HELP ALL MOBILE HOME PARK RESIDENTS I CANNOT SIMPLY STAND ASIDE AND NOT CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THESE RESIDENTS WHO ARE SUFFERING. IN MY DISTRICT AT THE RANCHO PALOS PARK. MANY OF THESE HOME RESIDENTS ARE SENIORS VETERANS AND AS WE KNOW ARE ON A- BIT LIVE ON A FIXED INCOME. AS WE CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC IN OUR AND NOW ADDRESS OUR STATE'S HOUSING AND HOMELESS CRISIS WE NEED TO DO MORE TO KEEP PEOPLE IN THEIR HOME. COLLEAGUES WE KNOW THAT THE FASTEST WAY FOR PEOPLE TO STAY ON OUR STREETS IS BY LOSING THE RESIDENTS THEY LIVE IN. AND BY KEEPING IN THE IN THEIR HOMES IS THE BEST WAY TO. DO WHAT WE CAN TO END THE HOMELESS CRISIS WITH ME TODAY BY PHONE TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT R.

EIGHT HUNDRED AT THE MATRICULA HAS THE TEMPERAMENT WOMAN CLICKS OF IT THAT I AM A RESIDENT OF RANCHO PALOS. WE OR IN A DIFFERENT-SITUATION THAN MOST OTHER MOBILE HOME PARKS BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY HAVE TWO CITIES IN OUR PARK WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT ASSEMBLY DISTRICT WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT UTILITY PROVIDERS WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT CITY COUNCIL WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH AND PROBABLY AND THAT IS WHY WE'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET ANYTHING DONE WE WERE BOUGHT BY A PREDATORY BUYER AND HIS REQUIREMENT WHEN HE BOUGHT THE SPARKLY BABY HAD TO BE MAKING A PROFIT IN TWO YEARS. PUBLIC% CALIFORNIA PAC WAS BUYING NEW PROPERTY THAT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE AND THE ONLY WAY THAT THAT COULD BE DONE WITH THE GALS THE CURRENT DENTURES HERE OF COURSE MOST OF US ARE ON FIXED INCOMES MOST OF THE CONTENT CAN FIGURE AT THE TABLE AND WE HAVE QUITE A FEW VETERANS IN HERE WE'VE HAD PEOPLE HERE THAT ARE. SO TERRIFIED ABOUT LOSING THEIR HOMES. D. FOR READ. AND SOLD A BARK BECAUSE THE WERE SO THEY WERE TO LOSE HOMES. WE'VE HAD TO P. ATTEMPT. ONE MOMENT HE WALKED UP THE RAILROAD RACKS THAT'S RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO LESSEN THE CHANCE TO GET HIT BY A TRAIN BECAUSE SHE WOULD HAVE HAD NO PLACE ELSE. TO GO IF SHE LOST HER HOME. WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET ANY KIND OF RENT CONTROL MEASURE BECAUSE WE'RE BETWEEN TWO CITIES AND WE'RE BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS ON SEVERAL THINGS THAT WE JUST KIND OF LIKE FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS. AS WE WATCH. WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN WE TRY TO PUT A RALLY TOGETHER WE'VE GONE TO THE NEWS MEDIA. AND EVERYBODY SAID ALL KNOW THIS IS REALLY TERRIBLE. BUT NOT TOO MUCH IS HAPPENING. DURING CODE WE HAVE FIFTEEN DEATH IN HERE AND I KNOW THEY WERE ALL STRESS RELATED BECAUSE- THE ONLY THING YEARS ARE VERY VULNERABLE AFFECT THE HEALTH OF OUR SENIORS THAT.

THEY PROVIDE IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS FOR HOMEOWNERS IN THE PARKING DESCRIBED BY THE PREVIOUS WITNESS WE'RE ALSO SUPPORTING IT BECAUSE IT CLOSES THE GAP IN THE- EIGHTY FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWOS PROTECTION. THAT BILL AS YOU KNOW PROVIDED JUST BECAUSE THE RENT GOUGING PROTECTIONS FOR RENTERS. AGAIN CONVENTIONAL RENTAL HOUSING BUT NOT TO THOSE EITHER HOMEOWNERS OR RENTERS LIVING IN A MOBILE HOME PARK THIS BILL PROVIDES THE NARROW EXPANSION OF THAT TO. PROTECT A CERTAIN SUBSET OF RENTERS THOSE WHO ARE LIVING IN A MOBILE HOME THAT THEY ARE RANGING FROM THE- FROM THE PARK OWNERS OF THE RIGID ABOUT THE HOME AND THE SPACE FROM THE OWNER OF THE PARK THOSE WRITERS. ARE CURRENTLY NOT PROTECTED BY THE STATEWIDE PROTECTION THE FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO. THOSE ARE CRITICAL PROTECTIONS ABOUT. THE TECH FOLKS FROM. REASONABLE RATE INCREASES BUT ALSO- UNFAIR. VERY FUTURE REDUCTION. DISPEL ALL. CLOSE THAT GAP BY PROVIDING PROTECTIONS FOR THOSE RENTERS. AND FOR THAT REASON WE SPOKE WITH THE OWNER AND I THOUGHT.

WE HAVE NO COMMENT FOR EITHER SIDE AT THE TIME ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE CHAMBER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. PRESIDENT WAS TALKING. I HAVE A QUESTION- IS HOW THIS PROPERTY TAX ASSESSMENTS PLAY IN TO THE BELLY OF ANY. LAND LARGER INCREASE- OF THE FEES THAT PEOPLE PAY WE HAD JUST HAD A BILL ON. ON INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS AND THAT SORT OF SEPARATE FROM THE RANT. MAYBE WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU RECEIVE A TAX BILL FROM THE CITY AND FROM THE COUNTY HOW IS THAT. IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS WITH US SAID SOMEBODY WHO'S FRIENDS- LIMITATIONS ARE THIS IS A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR'S NOTE FOR THE OFFICE OR FOR THE OPPOSITION. I THINK I THINK FOR THE AUTHOR I MEAN WE'RE WE'RE THE OPPOSITION HAS SAID THAT WE'RE PASSING ON THE REAL PROPERTY TAXES TO THE TO THE- COACH OWNERS ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK SILVA. THIRTY CARRIERS SPAHN I DO I THINK THEY'RE VERY SEPARATE ISSUES AND WE ALL RECEIVE AN ANNUAL TAX. BILL FOR OUR HOMES IF WE HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO OWN A HOME AND IF YOU ARE A LANDLORD IT YOU RECEIVE THAT SAME TYPE OF- BILL AND WE DON'T pTHERE'S A NEW TAX ASSESSMENT THAT IMMEDIATELY RENTS GO UP BUT IF YOU WILL ON NOTE ARE THESE RENTS HAVE DOUBLED. TWICE NOW AND THE LAST TWO YEARS AND IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO AS WE KNOW MANY OF OUR SENIORS WHO WON WE SAY FIXED IN INCOME WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT FIXED INCOME MEANS MANY TIMES THAT FIXED INCOME. IS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO'S DISABLED THESE ARE THE TYPES OF- MONTHLY INCOME SOMEBODY'S LIVING ON AND THEN TO DOUBLE SOMETIMES THE AMOUNT FOR THE PARK RENTAL SPACE. THAT MEANSAS WE'VE HEARD IN THESE ARE NOT DRAMATIC TESTIMONIES ARE ABSOLUTELY THE TRUTH OF SOMEBODY DECIDING CAN THEY- AFFORD THEIR MEDICATION CAN THEY AFFORD. FOR MILLS AND SO FORTH BUT CERTAINLY WE KNOW PROPERTY TAX IN ORANGE COUNTY IS CERTAINLY VERY EXPENSIVE SO I UNDERSTAND THAT FROM THE PARK OWNER BUT THEY ALSO UNDERSTOOD UNDERSTOOD THE TYPE OF PROPERTY THEY WERE BUYING AND WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE. AND THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THE SPECIFIC PARK OWNER HAS DONE THIS WHICH IS BY A PARK AND IT NOW SINCE ESCALATE- THE RENTS IN A VERY DRAMATIC FASHION. THANK YOU DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION SIR WHAT ELSE WELL I GUESS I MY UNDERSTANDING OF FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO- WAS TO LIMIT PRICE GOUGING SO I DON'T KNOW IT SEEMS THAT THERE'S AN INTERCEDING- PIECE OF INFORMATION SOMEBODY MAY HAVE THIS IS. A COMMERCIAL PROPERTY OR MOBILE HOME PARK THAT WAS ASSESSED IN NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT AND THEN THEY GET SUCCESS IN TWENTY NINETEEN THERE'S A BIG PRICE DIFFERENCE THERE THAT WHETHER THE- NEW PROPERTY TAXES WERE GO GO UP. I GUESS. WHEN WE HAD THE DESIGN. OF FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO WAS TO WAS TO HIT THE BUTTON- THAT INCREMENT THAT WISHES HE WERE A PROFIT NOT COVER YOUR COSTS BUT MAYBE I'M- MISS. THINKING OUR- WHAT DID WHAT THE- FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO WAS A WAS ABOUT- MY UNDERSTANDING OF IT AT THE TIME THAT THERE WAS A THERE WAS A RUSH BECAUSE PRICES WERE UP RUSHING NOT. I'M PASSING ON THE COST OF PAYING MY TAXES TO THE PEOPLE WHO RENT. THE D. DID YOU WISH THAT SOMEONE RESPOND TO THE COMMENT OR I THINK MAYBE AMENDMENT ARE. CONSIDER A GAS TAX ID COULD BECAUSE BECAUSE THIS IS I DON'T REMEMBER FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO HITTING LIKE THE TAX ASSESSMENTS. I'M SORRY YOU SAID BRIAN. AUGUSTA WITH THOSE DURING THE INTER. OKAY THANK THE MEASUREMENT WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO RESPOND YES. FIVE MISTER MARK OWSKI I THINK YOUR QUESTION INTO THE PRIOR SPEAKERS COMMENT. THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS MIDDLE DIFFER SLIGHTLY IN TERMS OF THE PERCENTAGES THAT ARE INVOLVED WITH THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS BILL. THESE LIMITS ON THE ANNUAL PERCENTAGE- THIRD ANNUAL COST OF. GROSS RENTAL RATE THEY COULD BE CHARGED. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE CALCULATION TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THOSE CHARGES THAT SPIKE ASSESSMENTS. FOR OTHER THINGS IT'S SIMPLY LOOKING OUT A CALCULATION OF THE RENTAL RATE THAT'S BEING CHARGED. AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE PRIOR YEAR. OR TWELVE MONTH PERIOD SHOW AND THAT IS THE SAME STRUCTURES FORTY TWO IT DOES NOT NECESSARILY TAKE. INTO ACCOUNT THAT WAS. IN PLACE BY THE WAY IN WHICH THE- I HAVE BEEN SET IN LOWE THAN FOR TWO THE WAY IN WHICH THE PRESIDENT PERCENT HAVE BEEN SET FOR. PROVIDE PLENTY OF ROOM FOR A PROPERTY OWNER TO RECOUP THOSE COSTS OVER THAT TIME PERIOD SO- BUT IT DOES NOT BECAUSE WE'RE A STATE WIDE LEVEL- CONTEMPLATE A SORT OF- INDIVIDUALIZED ASSESSMENT OF COSTS PERSON'S. RENTAL INCREASES- ALTHOUGH THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE A CONSTITUTIONAL LIMIT ON THOSE SORTS OF. SORT OF ALREADY AKEN HERE. BUT WE DON'T LOOK AT THAT FIND GREAT ANALYSIS AND EITHER. EITHER THIS PROPOSAL IN THE CURRENT LAW. HI THANK YOU SIR ANYTHING FOR THIS SORT OF WORK OWSKI NON ALL RIGHT- ANYONE ELSE MICROPHONE RAISED I SEE NO OTHER MICROPHONES RAISED- IS THERE A MOTION.

CASKEY I WEINER WEINER II YOU HAVE SEVEN TO ZERO SO FAR THANK YOU WILL PUT THE BILL ON CALL THANK YOU SIMPLY MEMBER TEAM MEMBERS ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT- WE HAVE CERTAINLY MEMBER RACE WHO'S HERE- AFTER ASSEMBLY MEMBER RACES BILL. WHICH IS A. B. EIGHT FOUR NINE ITEM NUMBER SIXTEEN THEN WE HAVE ONLY ONE MORE BILL TO BE HEARD TODAY AND THAT IS ITEM NUMBER TWELVE. EIGHTY EIGHT TO FIVE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE CHAIRMAN OF STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL AND ON THIS ISSUE I'M PLEASED TO SHARE THAT I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS I'VE SEEN ON PAGE EIGHT AND PAGE NINE IN THE ANALYSIS WHICH WILL PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO JUDGES IN ASSESSING DAMAGES. BASED ON THE SEVERITY OF VIOLATIONS TO RESIDENTS. EIGHTY EIGHT FORTY NINE WILL PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF SENIOR LIVING AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES BY CLARIFYING THAT UP TO. FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN DAMAGES CAN BE AWARDED HER VIOLATION OF RIGHTS RATHER THAN IN TOTAL. SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO THE LAW HAS STATED THAT RESIDENTS CAN BRING A CIVIL ACTION AGAINST FACILITIES THAT VIOLATE THEIR- OF THE FACILITIES MUST PAY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER VIOLATION. IN TWENTY TWENTY THE CALIFORNIA STATE SUPREME COURT IN GERMAN VERSUS H. C. R. MANNER KERR. INTERPRETED THIS LAW TO MEAN THAT THE MAXIMUM A VICTIM CAN RECOVER AND DICK IN DAMAGES FROM VIOLATIONS IS FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY VIOLATIONS RESIDENTS SUFFERED. THIS INTERPRETATION FROM THE COURT HAS RESULTED IN A LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY. FOR THE INHUMANE TREATMENT OF OUR SENIORS. IT IS CLEAR THAT CAPPING DAMAGES AT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OR SEVERITY OF VIOLATIONS IS NOT ENOUGH TO DETER AND REMEDY VIOLATIONS. OF THE RIGHTS OF OUR SENIORS. A. B. EIGHT FORTY NINE WILL SAFEGUARD SENIORS RIGHTS BY CLARIFYING THAT UP TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN DAMAGES CAN BE AWARDED PER VIOLATION OF RIGHTS RATHER THAN IN TOTAL. IN THIS WAY WE CAN BALANCE THE SCALES OF JUSTICE. AND ENSURE. THAT THOSE WHO HARM OUR SENIORS ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND THAT SUCH FINDINGS WILL SERVE AS A DETERRENT TO OTHERS. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY. IS TWENTY SECOND TELL. WITH CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM.

I'VE SPENT PRETTY MUCH MY WHOLE CAREER REPRESENTING OLDER AND DISABLED ADULTS AND FIGHTING FOR THEIR RIGHTS. WHEN I BEGAN WORKING IN NURSING HOMES I WAS APPALLED THAT THE SIGNIFICANT RIGHTS DEPRIVATIONS THAT OCCURRED ROUTINELY.WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT TO RESIDENTS WHO HAD VERY LITTLE POWER. HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE SECTION FOURTEEN THIRTY B. IS A REMARKABLE STATUTE. IT EMPOWERS RESIDENTS TO ENFORCE THEIR OWN RIGHT AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIANT ON THE STATE. THAT'S ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE STATE ENFORCEMENT OF RESIDENT RIGHT. AT TEN AND I'M SPEAKING CHARITABLY HERE HISTORICALLY AN ADEQUATE. I'LL TELL YOU ONE QUICK STORY ON PUBLIC ENFORCEMENT OF NURSING. WE KNOW THAT THE PATIENT STAFFING IS CRITICAL TO RESIDENT CARE IT'S THE NUMBER ONE VARIABLE FOR TELLING WHETHER NURSING HOME CARE IS GOING TO BE GOOD OR BAD. NOT SURPRISINGLY THERE'S A STRONG CORRELATION BETWEEN UNDERSTAFFING POOR INFECTION CONTROL THE EXTENT OF COLD OUTBREAKS IN NURSING HOMES OVER THE PAST SIXTEEN MONTHS. IT EXPECT THE PH TO BE. THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH TO BE VIGILANT WHEN MONITORING FACILITY STAFFING ENFORCING OUR MINIMUM STATE. STAFFING LAWS. WELL USING EASILY ACCESSIBLE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE NURSING STAFFING DATA I CAN TELL YOU THAT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR CALIFORNIA NURSING HOMES ARE UNDER THE STATE'S MINIMUM STAFFING REQUIREMENTS. ON THE AVERAGE DAY NOT ONE OR TWO DAYS EVERY MONTH BUT ON THE AVERAGE DAY. THIRTY DO THIS BIG UNDERSTAFFED BECAUSE THEY CAN'T THERE'S NO ENFORCEMENT RESIDENTS SUFFER THIS IS WHY FOURTEEN THIRTY B. HEALTH AND SAFETY FOURTEEN THIRTY B. IS SO CRITICAL TO NURSING HOME RESIDENTS. THEY USED FOURTEEN THIRTY BETWEEN SURE ADEQUATE STAFFING SO THAT THEY CAN GET HELP TO THE TOILET IN TIME. THEY USE FOURTEEN THIRTY B. TO GET COMPENSATION WHEN THEY'VE BEEN ILLEGALLY DUMPED INTO HOSPITALS OR HOMELESS SHELTERS. THESE FOURTEEN THIRTY B. TO STOP ILLEGAL DRUGGING WITH PSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS WHICH HAS BEEN ON THE RISE. DIMMICK STARTED BUT THE GERMAN CASE CRITICALLY DAMAGED FOURTEEN THIRTY B. FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR CAP PERVERSELY MAKES IT PROFITABLE TO HARM NURSING HOME RESIDENTS POLICE ARE OFF THE HOOK FOR FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS NO MATTER HOW OFTEN OR HOW VICIOUSLY THEY VIOLATED RESIDENT RIGHT. IN FACT THEY'VE TAKEN RECENTLY DEFENDING VICTIMS FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR CHECKS WITH A LETTER THAT SAYS BASICALLY NOW GO AWAY. EIGHTY EIGHT FORTY NINE RESTORES FOURTEEN THIRTY B.

THANK YOU MISTER SHE COULD TELL- MISS GERMAN. YEAH. JAMES GERMAN GO AHEAD. OKAY THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS JANICE GERMAN MY FATHER WAS JOHN GERMAN- IT NINETY YEARS OF AGE HAD AN ACTIVE LIFE SWIMMING IN A POOL THREE TIMES A WEEK AND LIVING IN ITS OWN HOME. MY FATHER WAS SUPPOSED TO GET REHAB THERAPY AT A MANOR CARE NURSING HOME FOLLOWING HIP SURGERY AND THEN COME HOME IN A COUPLE OF MNTHS. THIS TIME THERE BECAME A LIVING NIGHTMARE NO ONE RESPONDED TO HIS CALL LIGHT AND CALLS FOR HELP. ONE TIME I VISITED HIM AND FAMILY AND HALF NAKED AND COVERED IN FECES. NURSING HOME STAFF WOULD LEAVE HIM SITTING ON A BED PAN TELLING HIM TO PRESS THE CALL LIGHT WHEN HE WAS DONE. HE TOLD ME THAT HIS BOTTOM HURT AND WE DISCOVERED PRESSURE SORES ON ITS BOTTOM THIS LASTED FOR THREE MONTHS. I FELT HELPLESS AND CAN'T IMAGINE HOW MY FATHER MUST HAVE FELT. WE WENT TO TRIAL AGAINST THE NURSING HOME THE JURY FOUND THAT MANORCARE VIOLATED MY FATHER'S RIGHTS. THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO TIMES. I FELT THAT THE JURY HEARD MY FATHER THAT DAY BUT MY FEELING THAT JUSTICE WAS DELIVERED WAS SHORT LIVED I WAS SURPRISED AND SADDENED TO LEARN THAT LAST YEAR THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT WIPED AWAY THE JURY'S VERDICT REDUCING ALL THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO VIOLATIONS DOWN TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. IT PAINS ME TO THINK THAT THE NURSING HOME COULD VIOLATE MY% FATHER'S RIGHTS OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND GET AWAY WITH IT FOR ONLY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. WHAT DETERRENCE IS SHARING. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. IT ANGERS ME TO THINK THAT NURSING HOMES WILL GET AWAY WITH THIS WITH EVERYONE ELSE WHO HAS TO STAY AND LIVE IN ONE. THAT'S WHY I'M HERE TODAY SPEAKING HERE TODAY. AS MUCH AS I WISH I CANNOT TAKE AWAY ALL THE TIME MY FATHER WAS TREATED WITH INDIGNITY AS IF HE WERE LESS THAN HUMAN. I ALSO KNOW THAT I HAVE TO ACCEPT THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION. BUT I HOPE THAT YOU HEAR MY FATHER'S STORY TODAY JUST LIKE THAT JURY DID SHOW TAT MANOR CARE AND ALL OTHER NURSING HOMES YOU KNOW THAT THEY CANNOT GET AWAY WITH THE NIGHTMARES THAT CAUSED FOR THE MALL PRICE OF.

CALIFORNIA WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BELL AND ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE GERMANS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. MATT RECORD SURE THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THE TIME ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN AND- BACK TO THE FLOOR AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES- THE CONCERNS BEEN EXPRESSED I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL BUT THE CONCERNS BEEN EXPRESSED WITH RESPECT TO. VIOLATIONS THAT SEEM TO BE EITHER TECHNICAL ADMINISTRATIVE SO FOR EXAMPLE A GLITCH IN PAPERWORK VERSUS SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN- FLICKED WITH BED SORES OVER A NUMBER OF DAYS. AND I KNOW YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT- THE MINISTRY TO VIOLATIONS I REALIZE THAT THAT THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS BUT THAT ADMINISTRATIVE VIOLATIONS. AREN'T SUBJECT TO THE SAME KINDS OF VIOLATIONS AS I MENTIONED AS FOR EXAMPLE BEDSORES WHICH HAVE PERSISTED OVER A NUMBER OF DAYS. IS THAT RIGHT. THAT IS CORRECT ALL RIGHT OKAY. THANK YOU- BACK TO THE FLOOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS SENATOR STERN YOU HAVE A QUESTION. YES SIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- JUST TO GET SOME CLARIFICATION THOUGH. I GUESS I'M- I'M PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE TO. WHAT MAY BE SEEMINGLY TECHNICAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE VIOLATIONS THAT CUMULATIVELY OVER TIME TO RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT HARM TO THE PATIENT SO SOME OF THE EXAMPLES BROUGHT UP I THINK BY DR STEINBERG FOR INSTANCE LIKE THE MEALS NOT COMING ON TIME WE COULD. WE COULD EASILY DISMISS THAT AND SAY WELL THEY WERE JUST LATE FIVE MINUTES FOR ONE MEAL OR THEY DIDN'T BRING AT THAT TIME BUT- THERE'S A CUMULATIVE IMPACT TO THINGS LIKE. THE SIMPLE AS YOU KNOW. GETTING SOMEONE HYDRATED WHO DOESN'T HAVE FULL FULL USE OF THEIR FACULTIES- I HAVE A VERY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THIS WERE YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE NOT GETTING YOUR SIPPY CUP. FIFTEEN TIMES A DAY YOU'RE GOING TO GET SO DEHYDRATED THAT YOU DO GET A U. TI AND THEN YOU END UP IN THE I SEE YOU AND THEN THAT COULD BE THE END OF YOU. AND SO THOSE. THE DEATH BY A THOUSAND CUTS- IS SOMETHING I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT AND I THINK THAT. MAKES THIS BILL SO NECESSARY MAKES THE SUPREME COURT DECISION SO CONFOUNDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD HAVE ASSUMED THAT. THAT WAS SORT OF THE FULL EXTENT OF JUSTICE THAT WE WERE ENVISIONING BACK AT THAT TIME BUT I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WORK ON RECTIFYING THIS AND I WOULD JUST SAY HE IS A CAUTIONARY NOTE GOING FORWARD I THINK. NOT TO BE DECEIVED BY WHAT MAY SEEM LIKE A- AN INFRACTION THAT DOESN'T HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT BUT WHEN WE'RE NOT HITTING OUR NURSE TO PATIENT STAFFING RATIOS FOR INSTANCE PEOPLE ARE DYING AS A RESULT I MEAN LET'S BE CLEAR I DON'T MEAN OVER IT SAYS IT'S NOT EVERY TIME NOT IF SOMEONE DIDN'T SHOW UP FOR THE SHIFT BUT- THAT BUT- OVER THE COURSE OF THE WORK IN OUR NURSING HOME SECTOR ESPECIALLY. IN THE FOR PROFIT SPACE YOU KNOW WE ARE ABANDONING OUR SENIORS IN THERE AND- IT'S A GRIM REALITY THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE NOT SORT OF GONE THROUGH THAT- BUT I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WORK AND I'D BE HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN OTHER QUESTIONS I SEE CENTRE HURTS FOR HIS HIS MICROPHONE UP CENTERS FOR.

OR LEGAL REMEDIES FOR AGGRIEVED PARTIES ATTEMPTED TO SEEK REDRESS FROM SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND THIS SELECTION ISSUE THE SECTION EXCUSE ME AT ISSUE IN THIS BILL WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE THE PRIMARY AVENUE FOR LEGAL DRESS REDRESS I DO APPRECIATE THE CHAIR THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS WHICH IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT I WANTED TO INCLUDE MY AMMUNITION ON THIS WITH RESPECT TO THE MEASURE STILL THINK IT NEEDS A LITTLE BIT OF WORK BUT I THINK THAT.
