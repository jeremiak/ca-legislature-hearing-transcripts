OVERALL TEACHERS PROPOSALS RIGHT

00:35:38.303 --> 00:35:42.007 region:rollup2
X. WE KIND OF ARE BLENDING THE

00:35:41.172 --> 00:35:44.476 region:rollup2
TWO TOGETHER.

00:35:42.007 --> 00:35:45.910 region:rollup2
I I WAS GOING TO I THINK FINANCE

00:35:44.476 --> 00:35:48.313 region:rollup2
JUST EXPLAINED ALL OF THE

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:48.880 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS BEFORE C. T. FEED I

00:35:48.313 --> 00:35:50.682 region:rollup2
WAS GOING TO HIGHLIGHT OUR

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:51.950 region:rollup2
REACTIONS TO THE THREE THAT ARE

00:35:50.682 --> 00:35:52.884 region:rollup2
ON PAGE THIRTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA

00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:54.753 region:rollup2
PERFECT AND THEN JUST TALK AT

00:35:52.884 --> 00:35:56.621 region:rollup2

TO START OF OBLIQUELY AND SO I

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:01.059 region:rollup2
WAS STUDENT TAKE THEM IN THE

00:36:00.191 --> 00:36:02.060 region:rollup2
ORDER THEY APPEAR HERE IN YOUR

00:36:01.059 --> 00:36:03.328 region:rollup2
AGENDA SO ON THE FIRST ISSUE

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:04.396 region:rollup2
THAT'S RELATED. TO AUTOMATING

00:36:03.328 --> 00:36:06.664 region:rollup2
THE TEACHER MONITORING

00:36:04.396 --> 00:36:08.767 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES WE HAVE NO CONCERNS

00:36:06.664 --> 00:36:10.201 region:rollup2
WE DID EXAMINE WHETHER THE STATE

00:36:08.767 --> 00:36:13.405 region:rollup2
COULD DO IT THROUGH EXISTING

00:36:10.201 --> 00:36:14.773 region:rollup2
MEANS OUR DO IT MORE CHEAPLY BUT

00:36:13.405 --> 00:36:15.874 region:rollup2
CONCLUDED THAT IT COULDN'T.

00:36:14.773 --> 00:36:16.975 region:rollup2
THE INFORMATION BEING COLLECTED

00:36:15.874 --> 00:36:17.909 region:rollup2
WE THINK IS IMPORTANT ITS BASIC

00:36:16.975 --> 00:36:19.377 region:rollup2
TEACHER ASSIGNMENT DATA DOES THE

00:36:17.909 --> 00:36:21.446 region:rollup2

BE WORKING IN OUR AREA. AND TO

00:36:21.446 --> 00:36:23.848 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO DO IT AND I AYE A

00:36:22.714 --> 00:36:25.350 region:rollup2
SMALL AMOUNT OF ONE TIME MONEY

00:36:23.848 --> 00:36:26.751 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO AUTOMATE THAT FOR

00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:28.153 region:rollup2
EVERY SCHOOL EVERY YEAR I WOULD

00:36:26.751 --> 00:36:30.622 region:rollup2
HOPE YOU WOULD HELP DISTRICTS

00:36:28.153 --> 00:36:32.290 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND OF TEACHER SHORTAGES

00:36:30.622 --> 00:36:33.925 region:rollup2
EXIST IF THEY'RE PERSISTING. AND

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:34.459 region:rollup2
THEN AT LEAST SPUR A

00:36:33.925 --> 00:36:35.994 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO

00:36:34.459 --> 00:36:37.729 region:rollup2
RESPOND.

00:36:35.994 --> 00:36:39.130 region:rollup2
THE ONE POINT THREE MILLION FOR

00:36:37.729 --> 00:36:40.532 region:rollup2
THAT US ADMINISTRATOR

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:42.333 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT HAVE

00:36:40.532 --> 00:36:44.669 region:rollup2
CONCERNS WITH.

00:36:42.333 --> 00:36:45.970 region:rollup2
SO I'M YOU HEARD THAT A COUPLE

00:36:44.669 --> 00:36:47.238 region:rollup2
OF YEARS AGO AND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:49.007 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY THREE YEARS AGO THE

00:36:47.238 --> 00:36:50.575 region:rollup2
STATE PROVIDED TWO MILLION TO

00:36:49.007 --> 00:36:51.576 region:rollup2
DEVELOP THE API. THIS

00:36:50.575 --> 00:36:53.878 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATOR PERFORMANCE

00:36:51.576 --> 00:36:55.146 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT

00:36:53.878 --> 00:36:55.947 region:rollup2
AND SEE TO SEE THE LOTS OF GOOD

00:36:55.146 --> 00:36:58.183 region:rollup2
THINGS ABOUT FUNDING THEY WENT

00:36:55.947 --> 00:36:59.718 region:rollup2
OUT AND THEY DEVELOP THE EXAM

00:36:58.183 --> 00:37:01.720 region:rollup2
THEY CONDUCTED FIELD TASKS FOR A

00:36:59.718 --> 00:37:03.521 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND TEN CANDIDATES AND

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:05.023 region:rollup2
SIX AND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. TWO

00:37:03.521 --> 00:37:06.925 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND FIFTY CANDIDATES AND

00:37:05.023 --> 00:37:08.693 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AGAIN THE

00:37:06.925 --> 00:37:10.095 region:rollup2
TEST WAS ORIGINALLY UNDER THE

00:37:08.693 --> 00:37:11.930 region:rollup2
ORIGINAL BUDGET REQUEST TO BE

00:37:10.095 --> 00:37:13.064 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED AT THE END OF SIXTEEN

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:15.033 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN BUT THEY WENT AHEAD

00:37:13.064 --> 00:37:16.801 region:rollup2
AND DID A SECOND FIELDS HIGHEST.

00:37:15.033 --> 00:37:18.436 region:rollup2
IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN.

00:37:16.801 --> 00:37:19.871 region:rollup2
THEY ALSO USE A PORTION OF THE

00:37:18.436 --> 00:37:20.438 region:rollup2
MONEY TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAMS

00:37:19.871 --> 00:37:22.006 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO ADMINISTER THE

00:37:20.438 --> 00:37:25.643 region:rollup2
TUSTIN TO SUPPORT TRAININGOF

00:37:22.006 --> 00:37:26.411 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO SCORED THE TOSS.

00:37:25.643 --> 00:37:28.012 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE CONCERNED THAT NOW THE

00:37:26.411 --> 00:37:29.981 region:rollup2
REQUEST IS FOR ONE POINT THREE

00:37:28.012 --> 00:37:31.282 region:rollup2
MILLION TO DO ANOTHER FIELD TASK

00:37:29.981 --> 00:37:32.517 region:rollup2
BUT THIS FIELD TESTS WOULD BE OF

00:37:31.282 --> 00:37:34.018 region:rollup2
EVERY CANADA.

00:37:32.517 --> 00:37:35.520 region:rollup2
AND SO TYPICALLY WE DON'T DO

00:37:34.018 --> 00:37:37.489 region:rollup2
THREE FEEL TASKS AND WE DON'T DO

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:39.090 region:rollup2
A FIELD TEST FOR EVERY CANDIDATE

00:37:37.489 --> 00:37:41.926 region:rollup2
WHO'S TAKING ON.

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:43.061 region:rollup2
SO BEFORE YOU A SORT OF JUST AND

00:37:41.926 --> 00:37:44.229 region:rollup2
BUT BEFORE YOU REALLY NEED TO

00:37:43.061 --> 00:37:45.964 region:rollup2
DECIDE ON THIS WE WOULD JUST

00:37:44.229 --> 00:37:46.798 region:rollup2
SUGGEST THAT.

00:37:45.964 --> 00:37:48.066 region:rollup2
DID YOU SEE PROVIDER A CLEARER

00:37:46.798 --> 00:37:49.634 region:rollup2
EXPLANATION FOR WHY AN

00:37:48.066 --> 00:37:51.069 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL YEAR IS NEEDED WHEN

00:37:49.634 --> 00:37:53.204 region:rollup2
IT COMES TO TRAINING OF THE

00:37:51.069 --> 00:37:54.873 region:rollup2
EXISTING PROGRAMS TO BE FAMILIAR

00:37:53.204 --> 00:37:56.541 region:rollup2
WITH THE EXAM THE FAB FIVE YEARS

00:37:54.873 --> 00:37:58.209 region:rollup2
NOW TO AT LEAST BE FAMILIAR THAT

00:37:56.541 --> 00:38:00.111 region:rollup2
IT'S COMING. THEY'VE ALL EVERY

00:37:58.209 --> 00:38:01.446 region:rollup2
TRAINING PROGRAM HAS BEEN

00:38:00.111 --> 00:38:03.114 region:rollup2
THROUGH AT LEAST ONE TRAINING.

00:38:01.446 --> 00:38:04.649 region:rollup2
OUT SECTION TO LEARN WHAT THE

00:38:03.114 --> 00:38:06.584 region:rollup2
EXAM IS ALL ABOUT HOW TO

00:38:04.649 --> 00:38:08.686 region:rollup2
ADMINISTER IT.

00:38:06.584 --> 00:38:10.688 region:rollup2
ON THE THIRD ISSUE THE ONE POINT

00:38:08.686 --> 00:38:12.557 region:rollup2
FIVE MILLION FOR THAT POTENTIAL

00:38:10.688 --> 00:38:14.159 region:rollup2
RECORDS JUST I'M MOMENTS OF

00:38:12.557 --> 00:38:16.060 region:rollup2
BACKGROUND SO STARTING IN

00:38:14.159 --> 00:38:18.196 region:rollup2
NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE CTC STARTED

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:20.231 region:rollup2
DIGITIZING ANY NEWER CREDENTIAL

00:38:18.196 --> 00:38:21.065 region:rollup2
APPLICATION SO THE STATE HAS

00:38:20.231 --> 00:38:22.667 region:rollup2
DIGITAL RECORDS FOR EVERY

00:38:21.065 --> 00:38:24.569 region:rollup2
TEACHER HIS MINUTE APPLICATIONS

00:38:22.667 --> 00:38:26.271 region:rollup2
FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE. ON.

00:38:24.569 --> 00:38:27.839 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE TEACHER RECORDS THAT

00:38:26.271 --> 00:38:28.973 region:rollup2
ARE BEFORE NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE

00:38:27.839 --> 00:38:30.241 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE MOST OF THE RECORDS ON

00:38:28.973 --> 00:38:31.409 region:rollup2
MICROFICHE WHICH WE ALL

00:38:30.241 --> 00:38:33.011 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND IS OUTDATED

00:38:31.409 --> 00:38:35.446 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY IN SOME CASES THEY

00:38:33.011 --> 00:38:37.282 region:rollup2
HAVE THEM ON PAPER.

00:38:35.446 --> 00:38:39.284 region:rollup2
THE MOST OF THESE TEACHERS HAVE

00:38:37.282 --> 00:38:41.186 region:rollup2
RETIRED IF THEY HOVER RETIRED

00:38:39.284 --> 00:38:43.288 region:rollup2
THEY WILL SHORTLY HEAR.

00:38:41.186 --> 00:38:45.523 region:rollup2
I'M SO SPENDING ONE AND A HALF

00:38:43.288 --> 00:38:47.492 region:rollup2
MILLION TO TAKE OLD RECORDS AND

00:38:45.523 --> 00:38:48.993 region:rollup2
TO DIGITIZE THEM OUT WE

00:38:47.492 --> 00:38:50.795 region:rollup2
CONCLUDED WAS JUST ARE NOT COST

00:38:48.993 --> 00:38:52.130 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE SO WE DID ANALYSIS OF

00:38:50.795 --> 00:38:54.032 region:rollup2
HOW MANY REQUESTS THEY HAVE

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:56.367 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW TO GO BACK WITH THESE.

00:38:54.032 --> 00:38:58.670 region:rollup2
OLDER RECORDS MAKE IT ROUGHLY

00:38:56.367 --> 00:39:00.038 region:rollup2
FOUR HUNDRED A YEAR.

00:38:58.670 --> 00:39:01.439 region:rollup2
WHICH OUT OF HUNDREDS OF

00:39:00.038 --> 00:39:03.308 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS OF TEACHERS AS A VERY

00:39:01.439 --> 00:39:04.676 region:rollup2
SMALL NUMBER OF REQUESTS.

00:39:03.308 --> 00:39:06.244 region:rollup2
AND WE THINK AGAIN THAT THOSE

00:39:04.676 --> 00:39:07.679 region:rollup2
WILL GO DOWN BUT WE JUST RAN AN

00:39:06.244 --> 00:39:08.980 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE WHAT IF THEY WERE TO

00:39:07.679 --> 00:39:10.381 region:rollup2
GET SOMETHING LIKE FOUR HUNDRED

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:11.482 region:rollup2
REQUESTS A YEAR FOR THE NEXT

00:39:10.381 --> 00:39:13.151 region:rollup2
TWENTY YEARS AND TELL THESE

00:39:11.482 --> 00:39:14.686 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS ARE RETIRED NO

00:39:13.151 --> 00:39:16.221 region:rollup2
LONGER LIVING CLEARLY OUT OF THE

00:39:14.686 --> 00:39:17.388 region:rollup2
PROFESSION.

00:39:16.221 --> 00:39:18.890 region:rollup2
AND THAT ONE AND A HALF MILLION

00:39:17.388 --> 00:39:20.658 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT TWO

00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:22.193 region:rollup2
HUNDRED DOLLARS PER RECORD TO

00:39:20.658 --> 00:39:23.628 region:rollup2
DIGITIZE A WHICH IS ABOUT TEN

00:39:22.193 --> 00:39:24.829 region:rollup2
TIMES MORE THAN THEY SPEND RITE

00:39:23.628 --> 00:39:26.598 region:rollup2
NOW JUST GOING TO THE RECORD

00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:28.066 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT IT AND ANSWERING THE

00:39:26.598 --> 00:39:29.601 region:rollup2
QUESTION. SO WE THINK THAT COULD

00:39:28.066 --> 00:39:31.202 region:rollup2
JUST KEEP STORING THEM ANSWER

00:39:29.601 --> 00:39:33.171 region:rollup2
THE QUESTIONS AS THEY ARISE AND

00:39:31.202 --> 00:39:34.038 region:rollup2
IN A FEW YEARS THEY CAN START

00:39:33.171 --> 00:39:36.107 region:rollup2
RESPONSE AND WHAT THE RECORDS

00:39:34.038 --> 00:39:37.609 region:rollup2
OUT EXCESS THAT ARE NO LONGER

00:39:36.107 --> 00:39:39.277 region:rollup2
NEEDED.

00:39:37.609 --> 00:39:40.879 region:rollup2
THE LAST ISSUE BEFORE YOU HAS IS

00:39:39.277 --> 00:39:41.880 region:rollup2
NOT A SPECIFIC EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

00:39:40.879 --> 00:39:42.881 region:rollup2
REQUEST BUT DEALS WITH AN

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:45.183 region:rollup2
ONGOING ISSUE FOR THE

00:39:42.881 --> 00:39:46.651 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE REGARDING THE STATE

00:39:45.183 --> 00:39:47.785 region:rollup2
PROCESSING OF TEACHER MISCONDUCT

00:39:46.651 --> 00:39:49.354 region:rollup2
CASES.

00:39:47.785 --> 00:39:51.422 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY ELEVEN.

00:39:49.354 --> 00:39:53.024 region:rollup2
THERE WAS CONCERN REYES WITH

00:39:51.422 --> 00:39:54.792 region:rollup2
THE PROCESSING OF THESE CASES

00:39:53.024 --> 00:39:56.661 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A LARGE INCREASE IN

00:39:54.792 --> 00:39:58.596 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF CASES SUBMITTED

00:39:56.661 --> 00:40:00.031 region:rollup2
FROM THE FIELD TO CTC.

00:39:58.596 --> 00:40:02.867 region:rollup2
AND THEN BECAUSE OF THE

00:40:00.031 --> 00:40:04.202 region:rollup2
INCREASED IN OUR ACTUAL CASES

00:40:02.867 --> 00:40:06.571 region:rollup2
THERE WERE AS AN INCREASE IN

00:40:04.202 --> 00:40:08.406 region:rollup2
THOSE CASES THAT WERE APPEALED.

00:40:06.571 --> 00:40:10.675 region:rollup2
SO WHEN CTC MAKES A DECISION FOR

00:40:08.406 --> 00:40:12.043 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE TO REVOKE A LICENSE MORE

00:40:10.675 --> 00:40:14.012 region:rollup2
A CASES WERE BEING APPEALED AND

00:40:12.043 --> 00:40:15.246 region:rollup2
WHEN THAT HAPPENS THE CASE OF

00:40:14.012 --> 00:40:15.413 region:rollup2
SHIFTED TO THE HP.

00:40:15.246 --> 00:40:17.348 region:rollup2
SO.

00:40:15.413 --> 00:40:18.283 region:rollup2
.

00:40:17.348 --> 00:40:19.684 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE AND FIFTEEN

00:40:18.283 --> 00:40:21.119 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN THERE WERE LOTS OF MORE

00:40:19.684 --> 00:40:22.520 region:rollup2
CASES COMING TO THE AGE SHE THE

00:40:21.119 --> 00:40:24.555 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF APPEAL DECISIONS

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:26.124 region:rollup2
ALMOST TRIPLED FROM ELEVEN

00:40:24.555 --> 00:40:27.558 region:rollup2
TWELVE TO FOURTEEN FIFTEEN GOING

00:40:26.124 --> 00:40:28.860 region:rollup2
FROM SIX HUNDRED CASES APPEALED.

00:40:27.558 --> 00:40:30.862 region:rollup2
TO ALMOST TWO HUNDRED CASES

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:32.163 region:rollup2
APPEALED TO THE STATE PROVIDED

00:40:30.862 --> 00:40:33.531 region:rollup2
SOME MONEY THEY INCREASE THE

00:40:32.163 --> 00:40:34.632 region:rollup2
CREDENTIAL FEEL THAT EVERY

00:40:33.531 --> 00:40:36.134 region:rollup2
TEACHER PAYS WHEN THE FILER

00:40:34.632 --> 00:40:38.303 region:rollup2
CREDENTIAL FROM SEVENTY DOLLARS

00:40:36.134 --> 00:40:39.737 region:rollup2
TWO HUNDRED. IT WAS ESTIMATED TO

00:40:38.303 --> 00:40:41.139 region:rollup2
GENERATE FOUR MILLION DOLLARS

00:40:39.737 --> 00:40:42.840 region:rollup2
AND THE FORMALLY WAS EFFECTIVELY

00:40:41.139 --> 00:40:44.475 region:rollup2
GIVEN TO THE AG TO DO MORE

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:46.444 region:rollup2
PROCESSING OF THESE CREDENTIALS

00:40:44.475 --> 00:40:49.380 region:rollup2
SO THAT IT WOULD HAPPEN. AN

00:40:46.444 --> 00:40:50.448 region:rollup2
EXPEDITED FASHION.

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:51.983 region:rollup2
HAVING SAID THAT SINCE FIFTEEN

00:40:50.448 --> 00:40:53.017 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN THE NUMBER OF OPEN CASES

00:40:51.983 --> 00:40:54.385 region:rollup2
OVER THAT AT THE AG HAS

00:40:53.017 --> 00:40:56.321 region:rollup2
INCREASED SO IT WAS TWO HUNDRED

00:40:54.385 --> 00:40:57.789 region:rollup2
AND SIXTY OPEN CASES AND FIFTEEN

00:40:56.321 --> 00:40:59.657 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN IT'S NOW UP TO THREE

00:40:57.789 --> 00:41:00.959 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN OPEN CASES

00:40:59.657 --> 00:41:03.027 region:rollup2
AS OF SEPTEMBER TWENTY.

00:41:00.959 --> 00:41:04.562 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN.

00:41:03.027 --> 00:41:05.630 region:rollup2
SO STE LEGISLATURE'S BEEN

00:41:04.562 --> 00:41:07.532 region:rollup2
CONCERNED NOT ONLY GAVE MORE

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:08.1000 region:rollup2
MONEY BUT STARTED HAVING BOTH

00:41:07.532 --> 00:41:10.468 region:rollup2
CTC AND AG SUMMIT SOME BETTER

00:41:08.1000 --> 00:41:12.770 region:rollup2
RECORDS OF WHAT THEY WERE DOING

00:41:10.468 --> 00:41:14.238 region:rollup2
TO LEGISLATURE SO WE HAVE BETTER

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:15.840 region:rollup2
INFORMATION WITH AG IS DOING.

00:41:14.238 --> 00:41:17.642 region:rollup2
IT GAVE US A REPEAL REPORT JUST

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:19.444 region:rollup2
A FEW MONTHS AGO FEBRUARY.

00:41:17.642 --> 00:41:21.179 region:rollup2
SO WE KNOW FROM THAT REPORT THAT

00:41:19.444 --> 00:41:23.047 region:rollup2
THE AGING NOW IS DEDICATING MORE

00:41:21.179 --> 00:41:23.648 region:rollup2
STAFF TIME TO PROCESSING THIS

00:41:23.047 --> 00:41:25.383 region:rollup2
CREDENTIALS IT WENT UP TWELVE

00:41:23.648 --> 00:41:28.219 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

00:41:25.383 --> 00:41:29.487 region:rollup2
BUT WE ESTIMATE THAT EVEN WITH

00:41:28.219 --> 00:41:31.089 region:rollup2
AMOUNTS OF PROCESS IN THAT'S

00:41:29.487 --> 00:41:33.358 region:rollup2
OCCURRING RIGHT NOW THE AG WILL

00:41:31.089 --> 00:41:35.760 region:rollup2
USE THREE MILLION OF THE TUNNEL

00:41:33.358 --> 00:41:37.195 region:rollup2
AND THAT YOU'VE PROVIDED FOR.

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:38.463 region:rollup2
WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE BACKLOG

00:41:37.195 --> 00:41:39.697 region:rollup2
HAS GONE DOWN IN THE LAST

00:41:38.463 --> 00:41:41.366 region:rollup2
QUARTER COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS

00:41:39.697 --> 00:41:42.533 region:rollup2
ONE ABOUT TEN PERCENT.

00:41:41.366 --> 00:41:43.868 region:rollup2
BUT PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE

00:41:42.533 --> 00:41:45.436 region:rollup2
SETTLEMENTS HAVE GONE OUT

00:41:43.868 --> 00:41:46.504 region:rollup2
NOTABLY AND ONE OF THE REASONS

00:41:45.436 --> 00:41:48.106 region:rollup2
SETTLEMENTS ARE GOING UP IS

00:41:46.504 --> 00:41:49.640 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AN LJ RECENTLY AN

00:41:48.106 --> 00:41:50.808 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE DECIDED

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:53.010 region:rollup2
TO DISMISS THE CASE BECAUSE THE

00:41:50.808 --> 00:41:54.879 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE WAS SO OLD.

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:56.247 region:rollup2
SO WE ALSO KNOW THAT THESE CASES

00:41:54.879 --> 00:41:58.082 region:rollup2
ARE TAKING AN EXTRAORDINARY LONG

00:41:56.247 --> 00:41:59.951 region:rollup2
LEE LONG TIME TO PROCESS

00:41:58.082 --> 00:42:01.052 region:rollup2
SO CTC ON AVERAGE TAKES FOUR

00:41:59.951 --> 00:42:03.121 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN DAYS TO

00:42:01.052 --> 00:42:04.555 region:rollup2
PROCESS THE CASE IF IT'S

00:42:03.121 --> 00:42:06.491 region:rollup2
APPEALED IT GOES TO THE AGENCY.

00:42:04.555 --> 00:42:08.393 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE TAKING SIX HUNDRED

00:42:06.491 --> 00:42:09.260 region:rollup2
AND THIRTY FIVE DAYS.

00:42:08.393 --> 00:42:10.461 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS THE CASE SO IT'S

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:11.028 region:rollup2
TAKING MORE THAN A THOUGHT I'M

00:42:10.461 --> 00:42:12.363 region:rollup2
SORRY SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY

00:42:11.028 --> 00:42:13.131 region:rollup2
ONE.

00:42:12.363 --> 00:42:13.998 region:rollup2
STICKING MORE THAN A THOUSAND IS

00:42:13.131 --> 00:42:17.168 region:rollup2
TO PROCESS A

00:42:13.998 --> 00:42:17.969 region:rollup2
IT'S ALMOST THREE YEARS.

00:42:17.168 --> 00:42:19.604 region:rollup2
SO WE'VE BEEN SUGGESTING.

00:42:17.969 --> 00:42:22.173 region:rollup2
.

00:42:19.604 --> 00:42:23.408 region:rollup2
THIS AS A VERY LONG TIME IN MOST

00:42:22.173 --> 00:42:24.942 region:rollup2
CASES OBVIOUSLY I'M SORRY NOT

00:42:23.408 --> 00:42:26.577 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY BUT IN MOST CASES

00:42:24.942 --> 00:42:28.346 region:rollup2
TEACHERS AND ABSTAINED IN THE

00:42:26.577 --> 00:42:31.215 region:rollup2
CLASSROOM Y. THIS STATE REVIEW

00:42:28.346 --> 00:42:32.383 region:rollup2
IS OCCURRING. EVEN IF AND I'LL

00:42:31.215 --> 00:42:33.718 region:rollup2
ADD A LICENSES ULTIMATELY

00:42:32.383 --> 00:42:34.886 region:rollup2
REVOKED.

00:42:33.718 --> 00:42:36.154 region:rollup2
AND FOR THOSE WHO GET TO KEEP

00:42:34.886 --> 00:42:38.055 region:rollup2
THEIR LICENSE THEY'RE STILL

00:42:36.154 --> 00:42:40.124 region:rollup2
INCONVENIENCED BY A PROCESS THAT

00:42:38.055 --> 00:42:40.958 region:rollup2
SEEKING ALMOST THREE YEARS.

00:42:40.124 --> 00:42:43.394 region:rollup2
FOR THEM TO BE PART OF THIS

00:42:40.958 --> 00:42:45.296 region:rollup2
LEGAL PROCESS.

00:42:43.394 --> 00:42:47.698 region:rollup2
SO WE RECOMMEND TO CONTINUE

00:42:45.296 --> 00:42:49.300 region:rollup2
MONITORING IT CAN SEND YOU SEE

00:42:47.698 --> 00:42:50.301 region:rollup2
ENOUGH IMPROVEMENT OCCURS IF

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:52.070 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT DOESN'T OCCUR YOU

00:42:50.301 --> 00:42:54.472 region:rollup2
MIGHT LIKE FUNDAMENTALLY RETHINK

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:55.840 region:rollup2
HOW THE STATE PROCESSES CASES TO

00:42:54.472 --> 00:42:57.942 region:rollup2
SEE IF THE STATE'S ADDING VALUE.

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:59.510 region:rollup2
WHAT VALUE COULD EXPEDITE THIS

00:42:57.942 --> 00:43:00.912 region:rollup2
PROCESS?

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:02.547 region:rollup2
I HAD A MINIMUM YOU MIGHT WANT

00:43:00.912 --> 00:43:04.115 region:rollup2
TO PUT IN A STATUTORY TIME FRAME

00:43:02.547 --> 00:43:04.749 region:rollup2
MAYBE RATHER THAN THREE YEARS

00:43:04.115 --> 00:43:06.584 region:rollup2
YOU THINK IT SHOULD BE DONE IN

00:43:04.749 --> 00:43:07.885 region:rollup2
SIX MONTHS. BUT SOMETHING A YEAR

00:43:06.584 --> 00:43:08.853 region:rollup2
FROM NOW IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN

00:43:07.885 --> 00:43:14.358 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT THAT YOU

00:43:08.853 --> 00:43:16.594 region:rollup2
MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER.

00:43:14.358 --> 00:43:18.596 region:rollup2
MAYBE JUST IF YOU CAN RESPOND TO

00:43:16.594 --> 00:43:18.863 region:rollup2
THE LAST ONE IS OURS.

00:43:18.596 --> 00:43:21.365 region:rollup2
THAT THE.

00:43:18.863 --> 00:43:23.968 region:rollup2
THE NEED FOR THAT.

00:43:21.365 --> 00:43:25.369 region:rollup2
DIGITIZING. THAT SMALL UMBER OF.

00:43:23.968 --> 00:43:26.938 region:rollup2
RELATIVE SMALL NUMBER OF

00:43:25.369 --> 00:43:28.072 region:rollup2
INCREASE EACH YEAR. WHY THAT'S

00:43:26.938 --> 00:43:29.874 region:rollup2
POINTED SO WE HAVE?

00:43:28.072 --> 00:43:31.943 region:rollup2
?

00:43:29.874 --> 00:43:33.444 region:rollup2
WE HAVE ELECTRIFY FOR IN OUR

00:43:31.943 --> 00:43:34.912 region:rollup2
BUILDING THAT IS THE SIZE OF A

00:43:33.444 --> 00:43:36.681 region:rollup2
PROBLEM NINETEEN SEVENTY

00:43:34.912 --> 00:43:37.982 region:rollup2
MAINFRAME COMPUTER COULD TAKE UP

00:43:36.681 --> 00:43:39.684 region:rollup2
A SMALL ROOM BY ITSELF AND

00:43:37.982 --> 00:43:41.586 region:rollup2
THAT'S OUR STORAGE UNIT. FOR ALL

00:43:39.684 --> 00:43:42.720 region:rollup2
OF THE MICROFICHE THAT HAVE ALL

00:43:41.586 --> 00:43:43.821 region:rollup2
OF OUR CREDENTIAL RECORDS ARE

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:45.623 region:rollup2
ABOUT ONE POINT THREE MILLION

00:43:43.821 --> 00:43:47.792 region:rollup2
RECORDS AND IT.

00:43:45.623 --> 00:43:49.026 region:rollup2
AND.

00:43:47.792 --> 00:43:50.027 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY WE THINK THE MOST

00:43:49.026 --> 00:43:51.762 region:rollup2
EFFICIENT THING TO DO WAS TO

00:43:50.027 --> 00:43:53.364 region:rollup2
CREATE A DIGITIZED DATABASE FOR

00:43:51.762 --> 00:43:55.233 region:rollup2
THAT THAT IS.

00:43:53.364 --> 00:43:56.701 region:rollup2
ACCESSIBLE WE'VE HAD EIGHT

00:43:55.233 --> 00:43:58.102 region:rollup2
REQUESTS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS

00:43:56.701 --> 00:43:59.937 region:rollup2
FOR RECORDS THAT AS EARLY AS

00:43:58.102 --> 00:44:03.541 region:rollup2
NINETEEN THIRTY.

00:43:59.937 --> 00:44:05.142 region:rollup2
IT FROM AS A AS A CUSTODIAN IF

00:44:03.541 --> 00:44:07.078 region:rollup2
YOU WILL OF THE PUBLIC RECORD

00:44:05.142 --> 00:44:08.713 region:rollup2
AMONG COMFORTABLE WITH WITH

00:44:07.078 --> 00:44:09.814 region:rollup2
DESTROYING RECORDS RIGHT NOW I

00:44:08.713 --> 00:44:10.348 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US TO

00:44:09.814 --> 00:44:12.850 region:rollup2
KEEP. THEM INTACT AND AND

00:44:10.348 --> 00:44:13.417 region:rollup2
STORED.

00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:15.686 region:rollup2
OF THEY DO DETERIORATE OVER

00:44:13.417 --> 00:44:17.622 region:rollup2
TIME.

00:44:15.686 --> 00:44:19.056 region:rollup2
AND THAT BECOMES A PROBLEM FOR

00:44:17.622 --> 00:44:20.725 region:rollup2
STORAGE AND APPROPRIATE KINDS OF

00:44:19.056 --> 00:44:22.226 region:rollup2
STORAGE IT SEEMS TO JUST MAKE

00:44:20.725 --> 00:44:23.327 region:rollup2
BETTER SENSE TO CREATE ONE

00:44:22.226 --> 00:44:25.363 region:rollup2
RECORD OF DIGITIZED.

00:44:23.327 --> 00:44:27.899 region:rollup2
.

00:44:25.363 --> 00:44:29.167 region:rollup2
CREDENTIALS THAT CAN BE SEARCHED

00:44:27.899 --> 00:44:30.601 region:rollup2
AND UTILIZED FOR. FOR THE FUTURE

00:44:29.167 --> 00:44:32.069 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S

00:44:30.601 --> 00:44:33.404 region:rollup2
THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE

00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:35.139 region:rollup2
ASKING FOR THAT I HOPE I'M

00:44:33.404 --> 00:44:35.640 region:rollup2
ASKING ANSWERING THE QUESTION

00:44:35.139 --> 00:44:38.809 region:rollup2

THE TEACHER IN THE CLASSROOM IS

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:52.890 region:rollup2

00:45:18.015 --> 00:45:20.851 region:rollup2
YES DISTRICTS CAN REMOVE A

00:45:19.584 --> 00:45:22.320 region:rollup2
TEACHER FROM THE CLASSROOM.

00:45:20.851 --> 00:45:24.088 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THEY ARE SUBJECT TO

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:26.991 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT LAWS IN TERMS OF HOW

00:45:24.088 --> 00:45:28.492 region:rollup2

00:45:26.991 --> 00:45:30.161 region:rollup2
THE COMMISSION ON PROFESSIONAL

00:45:28.492 --> 00:45:32.296 region:rollup2
COMPETENCE HEARING FIX SATRAPS

00:45:30.161 --> 00:45:34.065 region:rollup2
SO IT DOES TAKE DISTRICTS.

00:45:32.296 --> 00:45:35.499 region:rollup2
A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME TO GO

00:45:34.065 --> 00:45:37.702 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE DISMISSAL PROCESS

00:45:35.499 --> 00:45:39.503 region:rollup2
BUT THEY DO HAVE THE PAID

ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE OPTION. SO

00:45:39.503 --> 00:45:42.240 region:rollup2
THAT FUTURE COULD BE NOT IN THE

00:45:40.938 --> 00:45:43.674 region:rollup2
CLASSROOM GOING THROUGH THE

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:46.143 region:rollup2

YEAH.

00:45:56.187 --> 00:45:58.256 region:rollup2
AND I HAD ANOTHER QUESTION.

00:45:57.088 --> 00:45:59.957 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS THE.

00:45:58.256 --> 00:46:01.892 region:rollup2
.

00:45:59.957 --> 00:46:04.562 region:rollup2
THE REQUEST FOR CREDENTIALS

00:46:01.892 --> 00:46:05.763 region:rollup2

THAT?

00:46:07.665 --> 00:46:10.534 region:rollup2
WELL IT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

00:46:09.166 --> 00:46:12.036 region:rollup2

RECENTLY HOWEVER. MENTION THAT

00:46:16.807 --> 00:46:18.876 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS A COMPLETE ANECDOTE

00:46:18.409 --> 00:46:20.578 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:46:18.876 --> 00:46:21.812 region:rollup2
SHE'S LIVING IN A HOUSE THAT

00:46:20.578 --> 00:46:23.948 region:rollup2

IN CALIFORNIA.

00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:32.490 region:rollup2
SHE WORKS AT A CHARTER SCHOOL

00:46:30.955 --> 00:46:33.824 region:rollup2
AND SHE'S SHE'S THINKING THAT

00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:36.093 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD BE A GREAT HISTORIAN

00:46:33.824 --> 00:46:37.428 region:rollup2
PROJECT FOR STUDENTS AND. THE

00:46:36.093 --> 00:46:38.663 region:rollup2

00:46:54.612 --> 00:46:57.581 region:rollup2

HAPPENS EVERYWHERE BUT IT

00:49:55.993 --> 00:49:59.597 region:rollup2

IN THE NATION WHAT WHAT IT TAKES

00:50:05.736 --> 00:50:08.772 region:rollup2
TO LET'S UNDERSTAND THE CAUSES

00:50:07.204 --> 00:50:11.575 region:rollup2
OF THE SHORTAGE. AND WHAT WE

THAT SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS

HAVE CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITIES

00:50:14.411 --> 00:50:17.882 region:rollup2
LIKE DEVELOPING IEP IS

00:50:16.447 --> 00:50:19.617 region:rollup2
COORDINATING ALL THE SPECIALISTS

00:50:17.882 --> 00:50:20.751 region:rollup2

VERY DIFFERENT THAN OTHER

00:50:30.995 --> 00:50:33.731 region:rollup2

ARE EXACERBATING THE SHORTAGE.

00:50:43.841 --> 00:50:47.278 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA IT TAKES FIVE

DEGREE MANY OTHER STATES ALLOW

00:50:50.447 --> 00:50:53.284 region:rollup2
STUDENTS TO DO THIS ON A MORE

00:50:51.749 --> 00:50:55.786 region:rollup2
EXPEDITED FASHION WHERE THEY GET

00:50:53.284 --> 00:50:56.820 region:rollup2
THE SPECIAL A CREDENTIAL. AND A

00:50:55.786 --> 00:50:58.088 region:rollup2
BACHELOR IN EDUCATION AND FOR

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:59.757 region:rollup2
FOUR AND A HALF YEARS.

00:50:58.088 --> 00:51:00.891 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA ALSO HAS A VERY

00:50:59.757 --> 00:51:02.192 region:rollup2
NARROW CREDENTIALS SO YOU HAVE

00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:03.327 region:rollup2
TO THE RATE CREDENTIAL FOR THE

00:51:02.192 --> 00:51:04.929 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC STUDENTS IN OUR

00:51:03.327 --> 00:51:06.063 region:rollup2
CLASSROOM.

00:51:04.929 --> 00:51:07.531 region:rollup2
AND MANY GRADUATE LEVEL

00:51:06.063 --> 00:51:08.899 region:rollup2
PREPARATION PROGRAMS LIKE AND

00:51:07.531 --> 00:51:10.434 region:rollup2
OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY PROGRAM ARE

00:51:08.899 --> 00:51:13.537 region:rollup2
IMPACTED SO FAR MORE DEMANDS

00:51:10.434 --> 00:51:15.039 region:rollup2
THAN FUNDED SLOTS.

00:51:13.537 --> 00:51:17.341 region:rollup2
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WE HEARD MORE

00:51:15.039 --> 00:51:19.009 region:rollup2
ISOLATED STORIES SO IN CERTAIN

00:51:17.341 --> 00:51:20.811 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS THEIR HR DEPARTMENTS

00:51:19.009 --> 00:51:22.346 region:rollup2
JUST WEREN'T WORKING AS THEY

00:51:20.811 --> 00:51:23.914 region:rollup2
SHOULD SO IT WOULD TAKE MAYBE

00:51:22.346 --> 00:51:25.649 region:rollup2
SIX MONTHS TO MAKE A HIGHER AND

00:51:23.914 --> 00:51:27.084 region:rollup2
BY THAT TIME ALL THE INDIVIDUALS

00:51:25.649 --> 00:51:27.584 region:rollup2
THAT HAD THE PROPER CREDENTIAL

00:51:27.084 --> 00:51:29.186 region:rollup2
HAD BEEN HIRED BY OTHER

00:51:27.584 --> 00:51:31.121 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS.

00:51:29.186 --> 00:51:32.222 region:rollup2
AND IN SOME CASES THE ONGOING

00:51:31.121 --> 00:51:33.691 region:rollup2
SUPPORT TO FOR THAT PARTICULAR

00:51:32.222 --> 00:51:35.392 region:rollup2
GOD.

00:51:33.691 --> 00:51:36.360 region:rollup2
SO THE GOVERNOR I'M JUST GOING

00:51:35.392 --> 00:51:38.329 region:rollup2
TO GO OVER THIS QUICKLY I THINK

00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:40.397 region:rollup2
FINANCE WILL TALK ABOUT THEM.

00:51:38.329 --> 00:51:41.632 region:rollup2
AT LENGTH BUT FACTOR OR IN MORE

00:51:40.397 --> 00:51:43.167 region:rollup2
DETAIL BUT THERE'S TWO PROPOSALS

00:51:41.632 --> 00:51:45.602 region:rollup2
TOGETHER THEY TOTAL A HUNDRED

00:51:43.167 --> 00:51:48.005 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS BOTH ONE TIME.

00:51:45.602 --> 00:51:49.406 region:rollup2
ONE IS FOR TEACHER RESIDENCY AND

00:51:48.005 --> 00:51:51.275 region:rollup2
ONE IS JUST A DISCRETIONARY

00:51:49.406 --> 00:51:53.844 region:rollup2
LOCAL GRANT YOU COULD APPLY FOR

00:51:51.275 --> 00:51:55.346 region:rollup2
THE FIFTY MILLION GET TWENTY

00:51:53.844 --> 00:51:56.847 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER CANDIDATE.

00:51:55.346 --> 00:51:58.082 region:rollup2
AND BE ABLE TO DO WHAT YOU

00:51:56.847 --> 00:52:00.351 region:rollup2
WANTED TO DO THROUGH A LOCAL

00:51:58.082 --> 00:52:02.186 region:rollup2
PLAN.

00:52:00.351 --> 00:52:04.054 region:rollup2
SO ON PAGE FIVE WE HAVE OUR

00:52:02.186 --> 00:52:05.656 region:rollup2
REACTION TO THOSE TWO PROPOSALS

00:52:04.054 --> 00:52:06.857 region:rollup2
WE THINK IT'S GREAT THAT THE

00:52:05.656 --> 00:52:08.225 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR IS CREATING A

00:52:06.857 --> 00:52:10.427 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION ABOUT SPECIAL ED

00:52:08.225 --> 00:52:12.162 region:rollup2
STAFFING SHORTAGES.

00:52:10.427 --> 00:52:13.631 region:rollup2
I'M IS HELPFUL AYE BUT WE HAVE

00:52:12.162 --> 00:52:15.299 region:rollup2
CONCERNS WITH BOTH THEY'RE BOTH

00:52:13.631 --> 00:52:16.900 region:rollup2
ONE TIME BUT THE KINDS OF THINGS

00:52:15.299 --> 00:52:18.802 region:rollup2
I JUST MENTIONED BY AND LARGE

00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:20.571 region:rollup2
NOT NOT ALL OF THEM BUT MANY ARE

00:52:18.802 --> 00:52:21.939 region:rollup2
ONGOING IN NATURE.

00:52:20.571 --> 00:52:23.540 region:rollup2
DOESN'T ADDRESS COMPENSATION

00:52:21.939 --> 00:52:25.476 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH WE HEARD OVER AND

00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:27.011 region:rollup2
OVER AGAIN NOTS THE CORE ISSUE.

00:52:25.476 --> 00:52:28.445 region:rollup2
NEITHER ADDRESSES STATE LEVEL

00:52:27.011 --> 00:52:30.514 region:rollup2
ISSUES LIKE CREDENTIALING AND

00:52:28.445 --> 00:52:32.216 region:rollup2
EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS.

00:52:30.514 --> 00:52:33.517 region:rollup2
NEITHER DRESSES LOOK AT SPECIFIC

00:52:32.216 --> 00:52:35.152 region:rollup2
LOCAL LEVEL ISSUES THAT

00:52:33.517 --> 00:52:37.221 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS THOSE DISTRICTS THAT

00:52:35.152 --> 00:52:38.822 region:rollup2
HAVE HR ISSUES THAT HAVE

00:52:37.221 --> 00:52:40.491 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS PROVIDING HELPFUL

00:52:38.822 --> 00:52:42.359 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ONGOING

00:52:40.491 --> 00:52:43.894 region:rollup2
SUPPORT. NEITHER DEALS WITH

00:52:42.359 --> 00:52:46.296 region:rollup2
IMPACTION UNCERTAIN SPECIALIST

00:52:43.894 --> 00:52:48.232 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

00:52:46.296 --> 00:52:48.966 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

00:52:48.232 --> 00:52:51.301 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC PROPOSALS THEY HAVE

00:52:48.966 --> 00:52:51.802 region:rollup2
UNIQUE PROBLEMS WE WOULD SUGGEST

00:52:51.301 --> 00:52:54.538 region:rollup2
THE FIRST US ON TEACHER

00:52:51.802 --> 00:52:55.739 region:rollup2
RESIDENCY IF YOU HAVE A SHORTAGE

00:52:54.538 --> 00:52:56.940 region:rollup2
IT COULD PRODUCE SLIGHTLY MORE

00:52:55.739 --> 00:52:58.275 region:rollup2
BETTER TRAINED COULD PRODUCE

00:52:56.940 --> 00:53:00.110 region:rollup2
BETTER TRAIN TEACHERS BUT NOT

00:52:58.275 --> 00:53:01.578 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY MORE TEACHERS THEY

00:53:00.110 --> 00:53:03.414 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE PRODUCED. JUSTIN

00:53:01.578 --> 00:53:04.815 region:rollup2
ANOTHER AVENUE THROUGH ANOTHER

00:53:03.414 --> 00:53:06.617 region:rollup2
TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAM.

00:53:04.815 --> 00:53:08.385 region:rollup2
IT'S ALSO VERY EXPENSIVE TO

00:53:06.617 --> 00:53:10.054 region:rollup2
PRODUCE JUST A FEW TEACHERS AND

00:53:08.385 --> 00:53:11.555 region:rollup2
SOME DISTRICTS RD USED OUR LOCAL

00:53:10.054 --> 00:53:14.491 region:rollup2
CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA TO

00:53:11.555 --> 00:53:16.226 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THESE PROGRAMS.

00:53:14.491 --> 00:53:17.828 region:rollup2
UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THIS

00:53:16.226 --> 00:53:19.296 region:rollup2
YEAR THERE'S ALSO SUBSTANTIAL

00:53:17.828 --> 00:53:20.864 region:rollup2
MONEY GOING AND SALAS YOUR FIVE

00:53:19.296 --> 00:53:21.732 region:rollup2
SUCH THAT IF MORE DISTRICTS

00:53:20.864 --> 00:53:23.133 region:rollup2
WANTED TO DO IT THEY COULD DO IT

00:53:21.732 --> 00:53:24.568 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO SUBSTANTIAL MONEY

00:53:23.133 --> 00:53:26.136 region:rollup2
UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON

00:53:24.568 --> 00:53:27.805 region:rollup2
ONE TIME DISCRETIONARY GRANTS IN

00:53:26.136 --> 00:53:28.872 region:rollup2
HIS IS A ONE TIME DISCUSSION ARE

00:53:27.805 --> 00:53:30.741 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL'S OF. DISTRICTS WANTED

00:53:28.872 --> 00:53:31.775 region:rollup2
TO DO MORE RESIDENCY SLOTS FOR

00:53:30.741 --> 00:53:32.409 region:rollup2
SHORT TERM.

00:53:31.775 --> 00:53:34.511 region:rollup2
ON A SHORT TERM BASIS THEY COULD

00:53:32.409 --> 00:53:35.846 region:rollup2
DO THAT.

00:53:34.511 --> 00:53:37.581 region:rollup2
THEN ON THE LOCAL SOLUTIONS

00:53:35.846 --> 00:53:39.116 region:rollup2
GRANT THE KINDS OF ISSUES WE

00:53:37.581 --> 00:53:40.617 region:rollup2
FOUND IN THE FIELD ARE DIFFICULT

00:53:39.116 --> 00:53:41.952 region:rollup2
ISSUES SUCH THAT IF YOU WERE

00:53:40.617 --> 00:53:43.320 region:rollup2
GOING TO GIVE ONE TIME MONEY AT

00:53:41.952 --> 00:53:44.822 region:rollup2
THE STATE LEVEL IT WOULD BE GET

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:46.490 region:rollup2
IT WOULD BE FOR DISTRICTS TO DO

00:53:44.822 --> 00:53:47.524 region:rollup2
THE DIFFICULT THINGS.

00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:49.026 region:rollup2
BUT UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S

00:53:47.524 --> 00:53:50.694 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL THEY CAN DO WHAT THEY

00:53:49.026 --> 00:53:51.762 region:rollup2
WANNA DO THEY WANNA BE DIRECTED

00:53:50.694 --> 00:53:53.797 region:rollup2
BY THE STATE TO DO THE DIFFICULT

00:53:51.762 --> 00:53:56.166 region:rollup2
THINGS.

00:53:53.797 --> 00:53:57.701 region:rollup2
SO ON PAGE SIX WE SUGGEST TAKING

00:53:56.166 --> 00:53:58.702 region:rollup2
A DIFFERENT APPROACH REJECTING

00:53:57.701 --> 00:54:01.238 region:rollup2
THE ONE TIME.

00:53:58.702 --> 00:54:02.940 region:rollup2
PLANS AND THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS

00:54:01.238 --> 00:54:05.409 region:rollup2
ON THE TABLE AND.

00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:06.877 region:rollup2
DOING A FEW OTHER THINGS.

00:54:05.409 --> 00:54:08.846 region:rollup2
THE FIRST IS THAT THE STATE

00:54:06.877 --> 00:54:10.180 region:rollup2
COULD REPEAL AND STATE LAW RIGHT

00:54:08.846 --> 00:54:12.182 region:rollup2
NOW IT'S SUCH A DEFAULT SALARY

00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:12.950 region:rollup2
POLICY IN THE DEFAULT IS THAT

00:54:12.182 --> 00:54:14.585 region:rollup2
THERE'S A UNIFORM SALARY

00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:15.819 region:rollup2
SCHEDULE.

00:54:14.585 --> 00:54:17.421 region:rollup2
AND WITH THE STATE COULD REPEAL

00:54:15.819 --> 00:54:19.590 region:rollup2
THIS AND JUST BE SILENT ON THE

00:54:17.421 --> 00:54:20.691 region:rollup2
ISSUE. THIS MEANS THAT DISTRICTS

00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:22.092 region:rollup2
COULD.

00:54:20.691 --> 00:54:23.961 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIVELY WORK WITH THE

00:54:22.092 --> 00:54:26.163 region:rollup2
UNION TO TRY TO EXPLORE MAY BE

00:54:23.961 --> 00:54:27.731 region:rollup2
CREATIVE ANDOUR ORDINARY WAYS

00:54:26.163 --> 00:54:29.533 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS COMPENSATION FOR

00:54:27.731 --> 00:54:31.235 region:rollup2
SPECIAL ED TEACHERS. THE STATE

00:54:29.533 --> 00:54:32.603 region:rollup2
JUST WANNA BE CREATING A DEFAULT

00:54:31.235 --> 00:54:33.871 region:rollup2
TO DO THE OPPOSITE THAT IT WOULD

00:54:32.603 --> 00:54:35.572 region:rollup2
BE CREATING A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:54:33.871 --> 00:54:36.540 region:rollup2
ROOM FOR FLEXIBILITY FOR THOSE

00:54:35.572 --> 00:54:37.474 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS WHO MIGHT WANT TO

00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:40.144 region:rollup2
ENGAGE IN THOSE KINDS OF

00:54:37.474 --> 00:54:41.812 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS.

00:54:40.144 --> 00:54:43.780 region:rollup2
WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT RATHER

00:54:41.812 --> 00:54:45.949 region:rollup2
THAN HAVING TO SPECIAL ED

00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:47.684 region:rollup2
CREDENTIALS MILD MODERATE AND

00:54:45.949 --> 00:54:49.319 region:rollup2
MODERATE SEVERE HAVING ONE. THAT

00:54:47.684 --> 00:54:51.488 region:rollup2
WOULD TRAIN INDIVIDUALS TO DEAL

00:54:49.319 --> 00:54:52.856 region:rollup2
WITH A PANOPLY OF SPECIAL A

00:54:51.488 --> 00:54:54.858 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES THAT MIGHT ARISE IN

00:54:52.856 --> 00:54:56.160 region:rollup2
THE CLASSROOM RECOGNIZING THAT

00:54:54.858 --> 00:54:57.528 region:rollup2
ONCE THIS TEACHER GETS ON THE

00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:58.729 region:rollup2
JOB THEY WILL CONTINUE TO NEED

00:54:57.528 --> 00:54:59.830 region:rollup2
ONGOING SUPPORT THEY'LL BE

00:54:58.729 --> 00:55:01.098 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL CHILDREN WHERE

00:54:59.830 --> 00:55:01.665 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GOING TO NEED SOME

00:55:01.098 --> 00:55:02.566 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE ON HOW TO HANDLE

00:55:01.665 --> 00:55:04.501 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:55:02.566 --> 00:55:06.503 region:rollup2
BUT THAT A PROGRAM COULD HELP

00:55:04.501 --> 00:55:09.339 region:rollup2
TEACHERS DEAL WITH A RANGE OF

00:55:06.503 --> 00:55:10.941 region:rollup2
DISABILITIES.

00:55:09.339 --> 00:55:12.376 region:rollup2
I'M ON PAGE SEVEN WE HAVE A FEW

00:55:10.941 --> 00:55:14.344 region:rollup2
MORE RECOMMENDATIONS THE STATE

00:55:12.376 --> 00:55:15.913 region:rollup2
ALSO COULD FACILITATE CREATING

00:55:14.344 --> 00:55:16.980 region:rollup2
THESE FOR YOUR PROGRAMS WHERE

00:55:15.913 --> 00:55:19.516 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS GET THEIR BACHELORS

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:21.585 region:rollup2
OF EDUCATION. AS WELL AS THAT

00:55:19.516 --> 00:55:23.520 region:rollup2
SPECIAL THATCREDENTIAL IN A

00:55:21.585 --> 00:55:24.955 region:rollup2
BLENDED FASHION.

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:26.390 region:rollup2
THIS IS AN AREA WHERE ONE TIME

00:55:24.955 --> 00:55:28.058 region:rollup2
MONEY COULD ACTUALLY HAVE LONG

00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:29.660 region:rollup2
STANDING BENEFIT SO THE STATE

00:55:28.058 --> 00:55:31.295 region:rollup2
PROVIDES A SMALL AMOUNTS OF

00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:32.629 region:rollup2
INSIDE OF MONEY FIRST YES YOU

00:55:31.295 --> 00:55:34.064 region:rollup2
AND OTHER TEACHER PREP PROGRAMS

00:55:32.629 --> 00:55:35.933 region:rollup2
TO CREATE THE PROGRAMS AND THEN

00:55:34.064 --> 00:55:37.568 region:rollup2
THEY GO ON EXISTING FOR A LONG

00:55:35.933 --> 00:55:38.435 region:rollup2
TIME. AND INDIVIDUALS ARE

00:55:37.568 --> 00:55:41.038 region:rollup2
PRODUCED MARK QUICKLY FOR THE

00:55:38.435 --> 00:55:42.005 region:rollup2
WORK FORCE.

00:55:41.038 --> 00:55:43.874 region:rollup2
AND LASTLY FOR THIS.

00:55:42.005 --> 00:55:46.476 region:rollup2
SPECIALIST PROGRAMS THAT ARE

00:55:43.874 --> 00:55:48.645 region:rollup2
IMPACTED WE RECOMMEND PROVIDING

00:55:46.476 --> 00:55:50.380 region:rollup2
SPECIAL ENROLLMENT GROWTH

00:55:48.645 --> 00:55:51.815 region:rollup2
FUNDING JUST FOR THOSE

00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:53.550 region:rollup2
OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY AND SPEECH

00:55:51.815 --> 00:55:55.385 region:rollup2
AND LANGUAGE PROGRAMS.

00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:57.921 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU DON'T FIVE PERCENT

00:55:55.385 --> 00:56:00.157 region:rollup2
INCREASES IN ENROLLMENT A YEAR

00:55:57.921 --> 00:56:02.059 region:rollup2
FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS IT COST.

00:56:00.157 --> 00:56:02.726 region:rollup2
X. HONORS LET ME FIVE THOUSAND

00:56:02.059 --> 00:56:04.061 region:rollup2
ROUGHLY TO SUPPORT THAT LEVEL OF

00:56:02.726 --> 00:56:06.463 region:rollup2
INVOLVEMENT.

00:56:04.061 --> 00:56:08.031 region:rollup2
TIMES.

00:56:06.463 --> 00:56:08.665 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S I I'D WITH FEW

00:56:08.031 --> 00:56:10.901 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT IDEAS THAT YOU MIGHT

00:56:08.665 --> 00:56:11.869 region:rollup2
WANNA CONSIDER AS YOU THINK

THE LOCAL SOLUTIONS GRANT WE

01:04:51.321 --> 01:04:53.123 region:rollup2
THINK BOTH OF THESE THINGS ARE

01:04:52.555 --> 01:04:54.224 region:rollup2
VERY TIMELY FOR THE REASONS

01:04:53.123 --> 01:04:56.559 region:rollup2

THAT CREDENTIAL WE SPENT THE

01:05:02.432 --> 01:05:05.268 region:rollup2
LAST SEVERAL YEARS WORKING WITH

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:07.303 region:rollup2
THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION THE

01:05:05.268 --> 01:05:08.371 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. A RE

01:05:07.303 --> 01:05:11.007 region:rollup2
CONCEPTUALIZING.

01:05:08.371 --> 01:05:12.509 region:rollup2
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN SPECIAL

01:05:11.007 --> 01:05:13.343 region:rollup2
EDUCATION SOUP TO NUTS?

01:05:12.509 --> 01:05:14.377 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'VE DONE AT THE

01:05:13.343 --> 01:05:15.945 region:rollup2
COMMISSION TABLE IS VERY

01:05:14.377 --> 01:05:17.947 region:rollup2
RECENTLY RESTRUCTURED THAT

01:05:15.945 --> 01:05:18.982 region:rollup2
CREDENTIAL IN WAYS THAT WE THINK

01:05:17.947 --> 01:05:20.850 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GOING TO BE POWERFULLY?

01:05:18.982 --> 01:05:22.385 region:rollup2
?

01:05:20.850 --> 01:05:24.087 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FOR THE QUALITY OF

01:05:22.385 --> 01:05:25.288 region:rollup2
THAT WORKFORCE MOVING FORWARD WE

01:05:24.087 --> 01:05:26.723 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED THE COMMISSION

01:05:25.288 --> 01:05:27.824 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED WHETHER WE SHOULD

01:05:26.723 --> 01:05:29.959 region:rollup2
HAVE ONE SINGLE SPECIAL

01:05:27.824 --> 01:05:31.828 region:rollup2
EDUCATION CREDENTIAL OR CONTINUE

01:05:29.959 --> 01:05:32.395 region:rollup2
TO HAVE AREAS OF SPECIALIZATION

01:05:31.828 --> 01:05:34.697 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE VETTED THAT IDEA

01:05:32.395 --> 01:05:35.932 region:rollup2
WIDELY. WITH TEACHERS WITH

01:05:34.697 --> 01:05:37.400 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATORS WITH EMPLOYERS

01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:38.601 region:rollup2
ARE AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:39.969 region:rollup2
THERE'S A SMALL MINORITY WHO

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:41.704 region:rollup2
THINK A SINGLE CREDENTIAL WOULD

01:05:39.969 --> 01:05:43.439 region:rollup2
BE WOULD MAKE FOR UTILITY HITTER

01:05:41.704 --> 01:05:44.641 region:rollup2
THAT YOU COULD PLACE ANYWHERE.

01:05:43.439 --> 01:05:46.709 region:rollup2
BUT THE LARGER CONCERN IN THE

01:05:44.641 --> 01:05:47.310 region:rollup2
REASON THE COMMISSION MAINTAINED

01:05:46.709 --> 01:05:49.212 region:rollup2
TWO DISTINCT.

01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:50.513 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY FIVE DISTINCT BUT

01:05:49.212 --> 01:05:51.581 region:rollup2
THREE OF THEM ARE AREAS OF

01:05:50.513 --> 01:05:53.249 region:rollup2
SPECIALIZATION IN TWO OR FOR THE

01:05:51.581 --> 01:05:54.951 region:rollup2
MORE GENERAL POPULATION OF

01:05:53.249 --> 01:05:56.352 region:rollup2
SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS. IS

01:05:54.951 --> 01:05:56.853 region:rollup2
THAT THEY ARE THEY ARE VERY

01:05:56.352 --> 01:05:58.855 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

01:05:56.853 --> 01:06:00.590 region:rollup2
KINDS OF NEEDS THAT NEED TO BE

01:05:58.855 --> 01:06:02.125 region:rollup2
MET AND IF WE PUT ALL OF THAT

01:06:00.590 --> 01:06:03.626 region:rollup2
TOGETHER IN ONE SINGLE PROGRAM

01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:05.061 region:rollup2
WE WILL LENGTHEN THE TIME THAT

01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:06.863 region:rollup2
IT TAKES TO GET CREDENTIALS IN

01:06:05.061 --> 01:06:07.931 region:rollup2
THIS AREA. AND WE MAY LIMIT THE

01:06:06.863 --> 01:06:09.699 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING

01:06:07.931 --> 01:06:11.668 region:rollup2
TO COME IN AND DO IT SO THE NEW

01:06:09.699 --> 01:06:12.936 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE MAINTAINS A MILD TO

01:06:11.668 --> 01:06:14.537 region:rollup2
MODERATE SUPPORT NEEDS

01:06:12.936 --> 01:06:16.472 region:rollup2
CREDENTIAL AND A SIGNIFICANT

01:06:14.537 --> 01:06:17.340 region:rollup2
SUPPORT NEEDS CREDENTIAL. BUT

01:06:16.472 --> 01:06:19.042 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE COMMISSION'S

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:20.510 region:rollup2
INTENTIONS HERE'S TO MAKE

CREDENTIAL AREAS READILY

01:06:22.345 --> 01:06:25.949 region:rollup2

01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:16.533 region:rollup2
PRESUME THEY'RE TEACHING ONCE I

01:07:15.298 --> 01:07:19.535 region:rollup2
HAVE IT IT'S WHEN YOUR DOCUMENT.

01:07:16.533 --> 01:07:21.037 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THAT'S GROWING THAT

01:07:19.535 --> 01:07:21.638 region:rollup2
DOES. MORE THAN THE LIKE SIX

01:07:21.037 --> 01:07:22.672 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS LESS.

01:07:21.638 --> 01:07:24.474 region:rollup2
AND THAT WOULD BE IN SPECIAL

01:07:22.672 --> 01:07:26.209 region:rollup2
EDUCATION SO LAST YEAR THAT THE

01:07:24.474 --> 01:07:27.310 region:rollup2
WHOLE POPULATION OF.

01:07:26.209 --> 01:07:29.479 region:rollup2
YOU SPECIAL WELL I THINK THERE

01:07:27.310 --> 01:07:31.614 region:rollup2
MIGHT INCLUDE INTERNS AS WELL AS

01:07:29.479 --> 01:07:33.049 region:rollup2
OF THE EMERGENCY PERMITS AND AND

01:07:31.614 --> 01:07:34.784 region:rollup2
WAIVERS ON BUT TAKEN TOGETHER

01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:36.986 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE. THAT'S THE POPULATION

01:07:34.784 --> 01:07:38.788 region:rollup2
THAT IS EITHER IN TRAINING OR

01:07:36.986 --> 01:07:40.089 region:rollup2
RECEIVING SUPPORT WHILE THEY ARE

01:07:38.788 --> 01:07:40.723 region:rollup2
PROVIDING TEACHING SERVICES BUT

01:07:40.089 --> 01:07:43.826 region:rollup2
NOT TO GET IN TRAINING.

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:44.427 region:rollup2
OKAY.

01:07:43.826 --> 01:07:46.496 region:rollup2
IF I MIGHT JUST LAND JUST A

01:07:44.427 --> 01:07:48.665 region:rollup2
SECOND OF HISTORICAL CONTEXT AND

01:07:46.496 --> 01:07:50.366 region:rollup2
BECAUSE MANY STATE INITIATIVES

01:07:48.665 --> 01:07:52.135 region:rollup2
WERE MENTIONED THE STATE HAS

01:07:50.366 --> 01:07:54.203 region:rollup2
TRIED LOTS OF THINGS ON THE

01:07:52.135 --> 01:07:56.372 region:rollup2
MARGIN FOR A LONG TIME YET SO

01:07:54.203 --> 01:07:58.074 region:rollup2
THEY'VE TRIED. COVERING THE COST

01:07:56.372 --> 01:07:58.942 region:rollup2
OF THE TRAINING INITIALLY

01:07:58.074 --> 01:08:00.510 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT THROUGH THE THROUGH

01:07:58.942 --> 01:08:01.544 region:rollup2
EIGHT OR LOAN FORGIVENESS

01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:02.445 region:rollup2
THEY'VE TRIED RECRUITMENT

01:08:01.544 --> 01:08:03.379 region:rollup2
CENTERS THEY'VE TRIED

01:08:02.445 --> 01:08:06.015 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

01:08:03.379 --> 01:08:06.883 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS. MANY THINGS AND I

01:08:06.015 --> 01:08:09.252 region:rollup2
THINK WHAT WE'RE HEARING THIS

01:08:06.883 --> 01:08:09.719 region:rollup2
YEAR IS A LOT OF THE SAME THINGS

01:08:09.252 --> 01:08:10.887 region:rollup2
ON A ONE TIME BASIS.

01:08:09.719 --> 01:08:12.889 region:rollup2
SO.

01:08:10.887 --> 01:08:14.991 region:rollup2
EAT IT.

01:08:12.889 --> 01:08:16.326 region:rollup2
YOU CAN DO THAT BUT IF IT'S NOT

01:08:14.991 --> 01:08:18.361 region:rollup2
GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM REYES

01:08:16.326 --> 01:08:20.530 region:rollup2
SO I THINK IF THE STATE WANTS TO

01:08:18.361 --> 01:08:22.031 region:rollup2
BE FIVE YEARS DOWN THE ROAD AND

01:08:20.530 --> 01:08:23.633 region:rollup2
BE IN A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT

01:08:22.031 --> 01:08:24.968 region:rollup2
POSITION AND HOUSE TO THINK

01:08:23.633 --> 01:08:26.336 region:rollup2
ABOUT FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT

01:08:24.968 --> 01:08:29.238 region:rollup2
WAY TO GO ABOUT DEALING WITH THE

01:08:26.336 --> 01:08:30.907 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

01:08:29.238 --> 01:08:32.342 region:rollup2
OKAY. AND THEN AS FAR AS THE

01:08:30.907 --> 01:08:33.876 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I KNOW THE

01:08:32.342 --> 01:08:35.011 region:rollup2
BUDGET IS WHAT IS TODAY BUT IT

01:08:33.876 --> 01:08:37.714 region:rollup2
IF THERE WAS.

01:08:35.011 --> 01:08:39.749 region:rollup2
AN OPPORTUNITY. IN THAT MAY

01:08:37.714 --> 01:08:41.017 region:rollup2
REVISION ARE THERE OTHER ISSUES

01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:43.353 region:rollup2
THAT YOU THINK WARRANT

01:08:41.017 --> 01:08:45.121 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT TO ROUTE YOU FOCUS ON

01:08:43.353 --> 01:08:46.923 region:rollup2
THE IN INCREASING THAT.

01:08:45.121 --> 01:08:48.291 region:rollup2
ALLOCATION FOR THE EXISTING ONES

01:08:46.923 --> 01:08:50.259 region:rollup2
I KNOW THE PRIOR YEARS WE'VE

01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:50.660 region:rollup2
WE'VE LOOKED AT OTHER IDEAS.

01:08:50.259 --> 01:08:53.496 region:rollup2
DO YOU HAVE ANY.

01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:56.132 region:rollup2
YOU MEAN SOMETHING NEW FOR MAY

01:08:53.496 --> 01:08:57.166 region:rollup2
REVISIONS CRORES OKAY WELL FOR.

01:08:56.132 --> 01:08:58.568 region:rollup2
I I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE MAY

01:08:57.166 --> 01:09:00.570 region:rollup2
REVISION AT THIS TIME HOWEVER.

01:08:58.568 --> 01:09:02.438 region:rollup2
THE PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE

01:09:00.570 --> 01:09:03.906 region:rollup2
BEFORE US TODAY THESE TWO.

01:09:02.438 --> 01:09:05.241 region:rollup2
.

01:09:03.906 --> 01:09:07.443 region:rollup2
TWO ALLOTMENTS FOR TEACHER

01:09:05.241 --> 01:09:08.611 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS I'M WE STILL WOULD

01:09:07.443 --> 01:09:10.079 region:rollup2
WANT TO FOCUS ON SPECIAL

01:09:08.611 --> 01:09:11.981 region:rollup2
EDUCATION FOR THOSE TWO

01:09:10.079 --> 01:09:13.282 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS BUT I GUESS IF THERE

01:09:11.981 --> 01:09:15.451 region:rollup2
WAS MORE IF THERE'S ANOTHER

01:09:13.282 --> 01:09:16.352 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST MORE IN

01:09:15.451 --> 01:09:18.121 region:rollup2
THE. WORKFORCE ISSUES WOULD

01:09:16.352 --> 01:09:20.189 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU PUT MORE MONEY FOR IT

01:09:18.121 --> 01:09:21.157 region:rollup2
SPECIAL ADD OR.

01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:23.159 region:rollup2

AND I WOULD I WOULD I WOULD

01:09:33.603 --> 01:09:36.806 region:rollup2
BASICALLY HAVE TO TAKE THESE

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:38.141 region:rollup2
IDEAS BACK TO MANAGEMENT AND

01:09:36.806 --> 01:09:39.042 region:rollup2

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

01:09:43.146 --> 01:09:46.416 region:rollup2

FIVE CREDENTIALS JUST TO ME

01:09:46.416 --> 01:09:49.218 region:rollup2

01:09:47.817 --> 01:09:51.154 region:rollup2
LIKE AN AWFUL LOT.

01:09:49.218 --> 01:09:52.889 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:09:51.154 --> 01:09:53.489 region:rollup2
I A I GET YOUR PERSPECTIVE I

01:09:52.889 --> 01:09:54.991 region:rollup2
JUST THINK FIVE SEEMS LIKE AN

01:09:53.489 --> 01:09:56.626 region:rollup2
AWFUL LOT. BUT WITH REGARD TO

01:09:54.991 --> 01:09:58.161 region:rollup2
THE MONEY JUST FOR SPECIAL ED I

01:09:56.626 --> 01:09:59.028 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM.

01:09:58.161 --> 01:10:01.097 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DRESS AS

01:09:59.028 --> 01:10:02.832 region:rollup2
A UNIQUE WE HAVE A TEACHER

01:10:01.097 --> 01:10:04.500 region:rollup2
CRISIS THAT SPREADS BEYOND.

01:10:02.832 --> 01:10:05.268 region:rollup2
SPECIAL EDUCATION SO I THINK WE

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:06.069 region:rollup2
NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT GOING

01:10:05.268 --> 01:10:07.970 region:rollup2
MUCH BROADER THAN JUST SPECIAL

01:10:06.069 --> 01:10:09.605 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:11.074 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:10:09.605 --> 01:10:11.674 region:rollup2
ASSIST SITUATION HAS BEEN

01:10:11.074 --> 01:10:13.209 region:rollup2
PERSISTENT FOR SURE. BUT AGAIN

01:10:11.674 --> 01:10:14.744 region:rollup2
I%

01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:17.480 region:rollup2
IN THE THEY THE CHALLENGES MUCH

01:10:14.744 --> 01:10:18.815 region:rollup2
BROADER AND GROWING DAILY. AND

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:19.582 region:rollup2
MAYBE ONE OF YOU CAN RESPOND AS

IT MIGHT OF BEEN ANSWERED

01:10:19.582 --> 01:10:23.086 region:rollup2
ALREADY. WITH REGARD TO

01:10:21.117 --> 01:10:23.419 region:rollup2
SPECIALIST THE SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:10:23.086 --> 01:10:25.288 region:rollup2
A CREDENTIAL.

01:10:23.419 --> 01:10:28.357 region:rollup2
THE.

01:10:25.288 --> 01:10:28.891 region:rollup2

COULD GET THAT CREDENTIAL HIM IN

01:10:34.163 --> 01:10:36.632 region:rollup2
A MORE EXPEDITED FASHION THEY

01:10:35.998 --> 01:10:38.234 region:rollup2
COULD HAVE IN THE PAST WHERE

01:10:36.632 --> 01:10:39.769 region:rollup2
THEY HAD A STANDALONE EXPERIENCE

01:10:38.234 --> 01:10:42.705 region:rollup2
THE FOR YOUR DEGREE. AND THEN

01:10:39.769 --> 01:10:43.940 region:rollup2

ON THE CREDENTIAL LATER IS THERE

01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:46.776 region:rollup2

DONE ENOUGH FOR YOUR MODEL YES

01:10:48.377 --> 01:10:51.547 region:rollup2
IN POINT OF FACT THE INTEGRATED

GRANT PROGRAM BECAUSE THE

01:10:51.547 --> 01:10:54.417 region:rollup2

01:10:53.116 --> 01:10:56.052 region:rollup2
COMPLETION OF A CREDENTIAL IN A

01:10:54.417 --> 01:10:57.587 region:rollup2
DEGREE WITHIN FOUR YEARS. TWENTY

01:10:56.052 --> 01:10:58.554 region:rollup2
ONE INSTITUTIONS HAVE BUILT

01:10:57.587 --> 01:11:00.389 region:rollup2
THOSE PROGRAMS IN SPECIAL

01:10:58.554 --> 01:11:01.357 region:rollup2
EDUCATION THEIR OPENING IN THIS

01:11:00.389 --> 01:11:02.525 region:rollup2
FALL.

01:11:01.357 --> 01:11:03.793 region:rollup2
SO THEY HAVE A SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:11:02.525 --> 01:11:05.428 region:rollup2
DEGREE.

01:11:03.793 --> 01:11:06.929 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR DEGREES

01:11:05.428 --> 01:11:08.264 region:rollup2
WILL BE AND THEY COULD TO IT

01:11:06.929 --> 01:11:10.233 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAD.

01:11:08.264 --> 01:11:11.267 region:rollup2
DISCRETION AROUND THAT I AND I

01:11:10.233 --> 01:11:12.769 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT THERE WAS RECENT

01:11:11.267 --> 01:11:15.338 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION A COUPLE YEARS AGO

01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:16.606 region:rollup2
TO ALLOW THE EDUCATION MAJOR

01:11:15.338 --> 01:11:18.508 region:rollup2
AGAIN FOR LAST YEAR AND LIKE

01:11:16.606 --> 01:11:19.842 region:rollup2
THOSE LAST JUST LAST YEAR. UP I

01:11:18.508 --> 01:11:21.711 region:rollup2
DON'T GROUP I DON'T RECALL

01:11:19.842 --> 01:11:24.580 region:rollup2
WHETHER THAT ENCOMPASS SPECIAL

01:11:21.711 --> 01:11:26.382 region:rollup2
EDUCATION OR NOT AND I DON'T I

01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:26.983 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK I'LL I THOUGHT IT

01:11:26.382 --> 01:11:27.383 region:rollup2
WAS MY BILL AND I DON'T RECALL

01:11:26.983 --> 01:11:28.317 region:rollup2
I.

01:11:27.383 --> 01:11:29.552 region:rollup2
DON'T REMEMBER UT I ALL FIND

01:11:28.317 --> 01:11:31.454 region:rollup2
OUT AND GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT

01:11:29.552 --> 01:11:32.421 region:rollup2
LET YOU KNOW I NEED TO FIND THAT

01:11:31.454 --> 01:11:33.022 region:rollup2
OUT YEAH.

01:11:32.421 --> 01:11:37.059 region:rollup2
THERE MAY BE SOMEONE BUT IT

01:11:33.022 --> 01:11:38.461 region:rollup2
JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT MAYBE WE

01:11:37.059 --> 01:11:39.028 region:rollup2
NEED TO INCENTIVIZE.

01:11:38.461 --> 01:11:40.563 region:rollup2
IT WAS RATHER WE NEED TO DO

01:11:39.028 --> 01:11:41.230 region:rollup2
THINGS ALL DIFFERENTLY.

01:11:40.563 --> 01:11:41.764 region:rollup2
I BECAUSE THIS PROBLEM THAT IS

01:11:41.230 --> 01:11:43.933 region:rollup2
PERSISTENT AND I GREW THAT

01:11:41.764 --> 01:11:45.101 region:rollup2
MAYBE.

01:11:43.933 --> 01:11:47.937 region:rollup2
FROM SACRAMENTO LEVEL WE NEED TO

01:11:45.101 --> 01:11:48.704 region:rollup2
INCENTIVIZE RCS YEARS RIGHT

01:11:47.937 --> 01:11:50.606 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THOSE OWNS THOSE THE

01:11:48.704 --> 01:11:51.207 region:rollup2
WORKHORSE OF THE TEACHER

01:11:50.606 --> 01:11:52.542 region:rollup2
CREDENTIALING SYSTEM AYE AYE

01:11:51.207 --> 01:11:54.076 region:rollup2
EVEN AYE YAY WONDER WHY YOU SEE

01:11:52.542 --> 01:11:54.644 region:rollup2
OFFERS A TEACHING CREDENTIAL

01:11:54.076 --> 01:11:56.279 region:rollup2
QUITE FRANKLY BECAUSE I JUST

01:11:54.644 --> 01:11:58.281 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK IT'S.

01:11:56.279 --> 01:11:59.315 region:rollup2
I THINK IT ALSO REFOCUSED AND

01:11:58.281 --> 01:11:59.882 region:rollup2
HOUSED IN THE CSU OR HAVE ONE

01:11:59.315 --> 01:12:01.984 region:rollup2
PLACE YOU KNOW

01:11:59.882 --> 01:12:03.252 region:rollup2
WITH THE EXPERTISE

01:12:01.984 --> 01:12:04.687 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ONE ONE STOP SHOP IF

01:12:03.252 --> 01:12:05.688 region:rollup2
YOU WILL. BUT I WONDER IF

01:12:04.687 --> 01:12:07.023 region:rollup2
THERE'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD DO

01:12:05.688 --> 01:12:08.724 region:rollup2
FROM AND IF SOMEONE STICK.

01:12:07.023 --> 01:12:09.492 region:rollup2
YEAH COMING ON THE SOMETHING WE

01:12:08.724 --> 01:12:11.360 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAVE A SACRAMENTO OF TO

01:12:09.492 --> 01:12:13.162 region:rollup2
INCENTIVIZE.

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:14.497 region:rollup2
OF THE CSU SYSTEM TO CREATE SUCH

01:12:13.162 --> 01:12:16.966 region:rollup2
A PROGRAM FIRST WE NEED TO MAKE

01:12:14.497 --> 01:12:18.167 region:rollup2
SURE IT'S LEGAL. SECOND WE NEED

01:12:16.966 --> 01:12:18.801 region:rollup2
TO SEE HOW WE GET IT DUCTS OF

01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:19.969 region:rollup2
ANYONE WANTS TO COMMENT ON WE

01:12:18.801 --> 01:12:21.070 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN TRYING TO TRACK JUST

01:12:19.969 --> 01:12:23.272 region:rollup2
THE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS THE

01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:24.640 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION TO CREATE INTEGRATED

01:12:23.272 --> 01:12:25.708 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS BUT WHAT WE'VE HEARD

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:27.543 region:rollup2
WHEN WE'VE HOUSES THAT.

01:12:25.708 --> 01:12:30.112 region:rollup2
INTEGRATED SORT OF TOOK OFF FOUR

01:12:27.543 --> 01:12:31.714 region:rollup2
YEAR BACHELOR'S PROGRAM AND TOP

01:12:30.112 --> 01:12:31.714 region:rollup2
DON WHO ONE YOU'RE PREGNANT

01:12:31.781 --> 01:12:34.951 region:rollup2
WE ASK THE COMPANY CREDITS DO

01:12:33.382 --> 01:12:36.352 region:rollup2
YOU NEED. TO GO THROUGH IT

01:12:34.951 --> 01:12:37.854 region:rollup2
SOUNDS LIKE THE OLD CREDITS IT

01:12:36.352 --> 01:12:40.256 region:rollup2
SOUNDS LIKE YOU CAN'T REASONABLY

01:12:37.854 --> 01:12:42.625 region:rollup2
DO THAT I'M FOR YEARS AND IT'S

01:12:40.256 --> 01:12:43.893 region:rollup2
STILL I THINK LIMITED TELAMON

01:12:42.625 --> 01:12:44.927 region:rollup2
TREE SCHOOLS.

01:12:43.893 --> 01:12:46.429 region:rollup2
SO IT AND MOST VIRTUALLY ALL

01:12:44.927 --> 01:12:47.296 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES ALLOW STUDENTS TO

01:12:46.429 --> 01:12:49.398 region:rollup2
GO THROUGH THIS IN A MUCH MORE

01:12:47.296 --> 01:12:51.133 region:rollup2
SEAMLESSLY WAY MUCH MORE QUICKLY

01:12:49.398 --> 01:12:52.835 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY GETTING SPECIAL AT

01:12:51.133 --> 01:12:54.704 region:rollup2
WORK SPECIAL A TEACHER TRAINING

01:12:52.835 --> 01:12:57.173 region:rollup2
IN THE SPECIAL ED CREDENTIAL

01:12:54.704 --> 01:12:58.341 region:rollup2
SIMULTANEOUSLY. IN BITS YOU TALK

01:12:57.173 --> 01:12:58.841 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE GRINCH ON TALK ABOUT

01:12:58.341 --> 01:13:00.443 region:rollup2
AGREE WHAT IF YOU HAD.

01:12:58.841 --> 01:13:01.878 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY DEGREE.

01:13:00.443 --> 01:13:03.479 region:rollup2
RIGHT THAT'S WHY I THINK WE WERE

01:13:01.878 --> 01:13:05.014 region:rollup2
GOING SO THE ANSWER IS NO

01:13:03.479 --> 01:13:06.582 region:rollup2
SPECIAL EDUCATION WAS NOT

01:13:05.014 --> 01:13:07.650 region:rollup2
INCLUDED IN THAT BILL. WILL

01:13:06.582 --> 01:13:08.985 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING TO GO

01:13:07.650 --> 01:13:10.253 region:rollup2
BACK AND CLEAN UP.

01:13:08.985 --> 01:13:11.854 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY SOME WILL HAVE A

01:13:10.253 --> 01:13:13.189 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION THANK YOU.

01:13:11.854 --> 01:13:14.090 region:rollup2
BUT I'D COULD I JUST ANSWER ONE

01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:16.025 region:rollup2
OF THE QUESTION TERMS OF THE

01:13:14.090 --> 01:13:18.995 region:rollup2
FIVE CREDENTIALS THREE OF THEM

01:13:16.025 --> 01:13:19.629 region:rollup2
ARE FOR LOW INCIDENCE SO ONE OF

01:13:18.995 --> 01:13:21.330 region:rollup2
THE SPECIAL AYE CREDENTIALS FOR

01:13:19.629 --> 01:13:22.331 region:rollup2
EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION.

01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:23.799 region:rollup2
A SECOND IS FOR VISUALLY

01:13:22.331 --> 01:13:25.468 region:rollup2
IMPAIRED STUDENTS A THIRTIES FOR

01:13:23.799 --> 01:13:26.669 region:rollup2
DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING. THOSE

01:13:25.468 --> 01:13:28.037 region:rollup2
THREE CREDENTIALS ARE SO

01:13:26.669 --> 01:13:30.907 region:rollup2
SPECIALIZED THAT THEY HAVE BEEN

01:13:28.037 --> 01:13:32.174 region:rollup2
MAINTAIN THE OTHER TWO HAVE BEEN

01:13:30.907 --> 01:13:33.976 region:rollup2
THAT'S A REDUCTION FROM.

01:13:32.174 --> 01:13:36.078 region:rollup2
WE ELIMINATED TO AND

01:13:33.976 --> 01:13:37.313 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATED THEM INTO JUST TO

01:13:36.078 --> 01:13:39.348 region:rollup2
WE USED TO HAVE FOR ADDITIONAL

01:13:37.313 --> 01:13:39.982 region:rollup2
AND THERE WERE SEVEN OTHER FIVE

01:13:39.348 --> 01:13:41.817 region:rollup2
IN ON IT AND THOSE TWO ONE IS

01:13:39.982 --> 01:13:43.286 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON SUPPORTING STUDENTS

01:13:41.817 --> 01:13:44.921 region:rollup2
WITH MILD TO MODERATE SPORT

01:13:43.286 --> 01:13:46.122 region:rollup2
NEEDS. IS COULD BE STUDENTS WITH

01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:47.356 region:rollup2
AUTISM THESE COULD BE STUDENTS

01:13:46.122 --> 01:13:48.491 region:rollup2
WITH BEHAVIORAL ISSUES THAT

01:13:47.356 --> 01:13:51.360 region:rollup2
COULD BE SO IT'S THE SPECIAL

01:13:48.491 --> 01:13:53.362 region:rollup2
EDUCATION. OF THAT IS CONSIDERED

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:54.964 region:rollup2
MILD TO MODERATE THIS THE OTHER

01:13:53.362 --> 01:13:56.666 region:rollup2
BRANCH DEAD THE COMMISSION

01:13:54.964 --> 01:13:57.867 region:rollup2
DECIDED TO MAINTAIN WAS FOCUSED

01:13:56.666 --> 01:14:00.436 region:rollup2
ON SIGNIFICANT.

01:13:57.867 --> 01:14:01.570 region:rollup2
MORE SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT NEEDS

01:14:00.436 --> 01:14:02.939 region:rollup2
THAT COULD INVOLVE.

01:14:01.570 --> 01:14:04.940 region:rollup2
PARAPLEGIC STUDENTS STUDENTS

01:14:02.939 --> 01:14:06.008 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE PHYSICAL HANDICAPS THAT

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:07.109 region:rollup2
INTERFERE WITH THEIR LEARNING IN

01:14:06.008 --> 01:14:08.744 region:rollup2
THEIR TEACHERS NEED TO KNOW

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:10.379 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THINGS TO HELP THEM

01:14:08.744 --> 01:14:11.113 region:rollup2
ACCESS LEARNING SO THE

01:14:10.379 --> 01:14:13.416 region:rollup2
COMMISSION REALLY JUST

01:14:11.113 --> 01:14:14.350 region:rollup2
DETERMINED. THAT IN ORDER TO

01:14:13.416 --> 01:14:15.918 region:rollup2
HAVE TEACHERS WHO WERE WELL

01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:17.320 region:rollup2
PREPARED FOR THE POPULATION OF

01:14:15.918 --> 01:14:19.121 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WE NEEDED TO MAINTAIN

01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:20.823 region:rollup2
THESE DISTINCTIONS. ARE AND NOT

01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:23.726 region:rollup2
TRY AND BLEND IT ALL INTO ONE

01:14:20.823 --> 01:14:25.761 region:rollup2
LONGER. A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM

01:14:23.726 --> 01:14:26.228 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO I THESE FIVE

01:14:25.761 --> 01:14:27.530 region:rollup2
CREDENTIALS ARE THEY.

01:14:26.228 --> 01:14:28.597 region:rollup2
SILOS.

01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:30.633 region:rollup2
OR IS IT YOU GET YOUR SPECIAL ED

01:14:28.597 --> 01:14:31.634 region:rollup2
CREDENTIAL THAT COVERS GENERAL

01:14:30.633 --> 01:14:33.302 region:rollup2
SPECIAL AND EVERYONE A LABEL

01:14:31.634 --> 01:14:34.837 region:rollup2
THAT. AND THEN YOU GET AN

01:14:33.302 --> 01:14:37.473 region:rollup2
AUTHORIZATION.

01:14:34.837 --> 01:14:38.474 region:rollup2
TWO TO TO TO TO TO WORKING CLASS

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:40.276 region:rollup2
OR TOWARD CHILDREN MIGHT HAVE

01:14:38.474 --> 01:14:41.344 region:rollup2
UNIQUE NEEDS I REALLY APPRECIATE

01:14:40.276 --> 01:14:43.045 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION BECAUSE THE AT THE

01:14:41.344 --> 01:14:44.013 region:rollup2
HEART AND SOUL OF THE CHANGE

01:14:43.045 --> 01:14:45.915 region:rollup2
WE'VE MADE IN THE SPECIAL A

01:14:44.013 --> 01:14:47.583 region:rollup2
CREDENTIAL. IS TO REMOVE IT FROM

01:14:45.915 --> 01:14:48.551 region:rollup2
ITS SILO.

01:14:47.583 --> 01:14:50.519 region:rollup2
TO CREATE A COMMON CORE

01:14:48.551 --> 01:14:51.854 region:rollup2
PREPARATION THAT ALL GEN ED AND

01:14:50.519 --> 01:14:53.589 region:rollup2
ALL SPECIALIST TEACHERS COMPLETE

01:14:51.854 --> 01:14:55.424 region:rollup2
TOGETHER.

01:14:53.589 --> 01:14:56.759 region:rollup2
A WHERE THEY LEARN ABOUT

01:14:55.424 --> 01:14:57.760 region:rollup2
TEACHING AND LEARNING IN LEANING

01:14:56.759 --> 01:14:59.495 region:rollup2
TO DIE LEARNING TO TEACH A

01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:01.163 region:rollup2
DIVERSE THE FULL DIVERSE.

01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:02.565 region:rollup2
STUDENT POPULATION THAT WE HAVE

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:05.267 region:rollup2
AND THEN SPECIALIZATIONS ARE

01:15:02.565 --> 01:15:06.335 region:rollup2
ADDED ON THAT COMMON CENTRAL

01:15:05.267 --> 01:15:07.970 region:rollup2
CORE OF PREPARATION OR TRUNK

01:15:06.335 --> 01:15:09.338 region:rollup2
PREPARATION I HAVE A PICTURE OF

01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:10.406 region:rollup2
A TRIO OF HAPPY THAT WE SHARE

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:13.309 region:rollup2
WITH YOU IT'S BEEN A METAPHOR

01:15:10.406 --> 01:15:14.477 region:rollup2
FOR IT. BUT THAT COMMON TRUNK IS

01:15:13.309 --> 01:15:15.711 region:rollup2
THAT THAT'S THE NEW CHANGE IN

01:15:14.477 --> 01:15:17.546 region:rollup2
THAT WHAT'S PARTICULARLY

01:15:15.711 --> 01:15:18.414 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT ABOUT THAT IS THAT IS

01:15:17.546 --> 01:15:19.915 region:rollup2
THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF

01:15:18.414 --> 01:15:21.884 region:rollup2
EDUCATION HAS BEEN FUNDED AND IS

01:15:19.915 --> 01:15:23.552 region:rollup2
EXPANDING MULTI TIERED SYSTEMS

01:15:21.884 --> 01:15:25.187 region:rollup2
OF SUPPORT. AS A FRAMEWORK FOR

01:15:23.552 --> 01:15:27.189 region:rollup2
DELIVERY OF STUDENT I SERVICES

01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:29.225 region:rollup2
TO ALL STUDENTS THIS MODEL

01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:29.959 region:rollup2
MATCHES THAT FRAME FOR HOW WE

01:15:29.225 --> 01:15:32.294 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT TEACHING OUR

01:15:29.959 --> 01:15:33.996 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WERE ALL STUDENTS ARE

01:15:32.294 --> 01:15:35.264 region:rollup2
JANET STUDENTS FIRST. AND WHEN

01:15:33.996 --> 01:15:36.665 region:rollup2
THEY NEED AN INTERVENTION THEY

01:15:35.264 --> 01:15:38.267 region:rollup2
HAVE SOMEONE WITH THE TRAINING

01:15:36.665 --> 01:15:40.403 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE THAT INTERVENTION BUT

01:15:38.267 --> 01:15:42.471 region:rollup2
THEY ARE SILENT THAT I THINK IS

01:15:40.403 --> 01:15:44.173 region:rollup2
THE VISION OF ANTI SS BUT

01:15:42.471 --> 01:15:45.708 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZING THAT MTS THIS IS LOW

01:15:44.173 --> 01:15:47.610 region:rollup2
LIVES IN A STATE WHERE WE STILL

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:49.078 region:rollup2
HAVE A WIDER WAY. OF WAYS IN

01:15:47.610 --> 01:15:51.380 region:rollup2
WHICH WE SERVE STUDENTS WITH

01:15:49.078 --> 01:15:53.349 region:rollup2
SPECIAL NEEDS SOMETIMES IN A

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:55.051 region:rollup2
SILO ROAD. CLASSROOMS SOMETIMES

01:15:53.349 --> 01:15:56.852 region:rollup2
IN INTEGRATED CLASSROOMS FULLY I

01:15:55.051 --> 01:15:58.554 region:rollup2
INCLUDED ON BUT THE CREDENTIAL

01:15:56.852 --> 01:16:00.189 region:rollup2
IS INTENDED TO SERVE THAT

01:15:58.554 --> 01:16:02.925 region:rollup2
MULTIPLICITY OF WAYS WE DELIVER

01:16:00.189 --> 01:16:04.260 region:rollup2
SERVICES BUT REALLY DRIVE TO

01:16:02.925 --> 01:16:05.461 region:rollup2
WORK THIS CALM AND.

01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:07.730 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING THAT ALL STUDENTS

01:16:05.461 --> 01:16:09.031 region:rollup2
ARE ALL BELONG TO ALL TEACHERS

01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:10.699 region:rollup2
SO QUICKLY THEY LET ME HELP ME

01:16:09.031 --> 01:16:10.1000 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT IS SO DO I GET A

01:16:10.699 --> 01:16:13.002 region:rollup2
CREDENTIAL.

01:16:10.1000 --> 01:16:14.503 region:rollup2
TO WORK WITH CHILDREN WHO ARE

01:16:13.002 --> 01:16:15.871 region:rollup2
VISUALLY IMPAIRED ESPECIALLY

01:16:14.503 --> 01:16:17.073 region:rollup2
CREDENTIAL OR CHILDREN ARE

01:16:15.871 --> 01:16:18.874 region:rollup2
VISUALLY IMPAIRED OR DOING

01:16:17.073 --> 01:16:20.276 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY CREDENTIAL THEN I GET

01:16:18.874 --> 01:16:20.776 region:rollup2
AN AUTHORIZATION.

01:16:20.276 --> 01:16:22.244 region:rollup2
TO WORK WITH CHILDREN OR

01:16:20.776 --> 01:16:23.479 region:rollup2
VISUALLY IMPAIRED.

01:16:22.244 --> 01:16:24.680 region:rollup2
SO THE CREDENTIAL ITSELF WOULD

01:16:23.479 --> 01:16:25.214 region:rollup2
CARRY THAT AUTHORIZATION SO IT'S

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:27.316 region:rollup2
NOT DO ONE AND THEN DO THE

01:16:25.214 --> 01:16:29.018 region:rollup2
OTHER.

01:16:27.316 --> 01:16:30.252 region:rollup2
SO ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE VIEW WHAT

01:16:29.018 --> 01:16:31.687 region:rollup2
WE VISUALIZE FOR THE AYE

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:32.888 region:rollup2
TEACHERS WHO WILL TEACH VISUALLY

01:16:31.687 --> 01:16:34.156 region:rollup2
IMPAIRED STUDENTS SAID THEY

01:16:32.888 --> 01:16:36.358 region:rollup2
ENGAGE IN THAT COMMON TRUCK

01:16:34.156 --> 01:16:37.960 region:rollup2
PREPARATION WITH GEN ED AND ALL

01:16:36.358 --> 01:16:39.261 region:rollup2
OTHER SPECIAL ED TEACHERS.

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:40.262 region:rollup2
ARE AND THEN THEY BEGIN TO

01:16:39.261 --> 01:16:41.897 region:rollup2
SPECIALIZE ON WHAT ARE THE

01:16:40.262 --> 01:16:43.065 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR NEEDS THAT VISUALLY

01:16:41.897 --> 01:16:44.900 region:rollup2
IMPAIRED STUDENTS NEED AND HOW

01:16:43.065 --> 01:16:45.734 region:rollup2
DO YOU DELIVER THOSE.

01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:47.036 region:rollup2
AND THEY WILL LEARN ONE

01:16:45.734 --> 01:16:48.370 region:rollup2
CREDENTIAL THAT AUTHORIZATION

01:16:47.036 --> 01:16:50.372 region:rollup2
WILL BE WITHIN IT IF THEY WANT

01:16:48.370 --> 01:16:51.207 region:rollup2
TO ADD DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING

01:16:50.372 --> 01:16:52.141 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK TO

01:16:51.207 --> 01:16:55.077 region:rollup2
THE BEGINNING TO COMPLETE THE

01:16:52.141 --> 01:16:56.078 region:rollup2
SAME TRUNK AGAIN. THEY HAVE TO

01:16:55.077 --> 01:16:58.247 region:rollup2
AT THE SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE TO

01:16:56.078 --> 01:16:59.114 region:rollup2
ADD AN AUTHORIZATION A DEAF AND

01:16:58.247 --> 01:17:00.916 region:rollup2
HARD HEARING THEY WANT TO ADD.

01:16:59.114 --> 01:17:03.819 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER IT WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:17:00.916 --> 01:17:05.454 region:rollup2
HAVING MORE FOCUSED BRIDGES AND

01:17:03.819 --> 01:17:06.622 region:rollup2
ELIMINATING DUPLICATION.

01:17:05.454 --> 01:17:07.756 region:rollup2
WHERE WHERE A CANDIDATE WHO

01:17:06.622 --> 01:17:08.958 region:rollup2
WANTED TO ADD SOMETHING WOULD

01:17:07.756 --> 01:17:10.860 region:rollup2
HAVE TO START OVER AND DO A

01:17:08.958 --> 01:17:13.028 region:rollup2
WHOLE CONFERENCE PROGRAM

01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:15.197 region:rollup2
SINCE UP I'M STILL NOT? SO TO IF

01:17:13.028 --> 01:17:16.499 region:rollup2
I IF I GET A SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:17:15.197 --> 01:17:17.900 region:rollup2
CREDENTIAL.

01:17:16.499 --> 01:17:19.401 region:rollup2
FOR IS A SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:20.436 region:rollup2
CREDENTIAL FOR THE VISUALLY

01:17:19.401 --> 01:17:21.937 region:rollup2
IMPAIRED OR AS A SPECIAL

01:17:20.436 --> 01:17:23.105 region:rollup2
EDUCATION CREDENTIAL WHAT I'D BE

01:17:21.937 --> 01:17:25.074 region:rollup2
ABLE TO TO.

SPECIAL EDUCATION CLASSROOM

01:17:26.342 --> 01:17:29.111 region:rollup2
SETTING WHERE THERE MIGHT NOT BE

01:17:28.077 --> 01:17:29.678 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WHO ARE VISUALLY

01:17:29.111 --> 01:17:31.814 region:rollup2
IMPAIRED TO HAVE THAT BASE.

01:17:29.678 --> 01:17:33.582 region:rollup2
NO.

01:17:31.814 --> 01:17:34.817 region:rollup2
YEAH THAT BASS OCCURS I EACH

01:17:33.582 --> 01:17:37.586 region:rollup2
EACH OF THE BRANCHES WILL HAVE A

01:17:34.817 --> 01:17:39.922 region:rollup2
BASE THAT IS PART OF THEIR AREA

01:17:37.586 --> 01:17:41.157 region:rollup2
OF SPECIALIZATION SO IF YOU GO

01:17:39.922 --> 01:17:43.659 region:rollup2

YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN HAVING THIS

01:17:49.465 --> 01:17:52.101 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION FOR SOME LONG AND I

01:17:50.633 --> 01:17:54.103 region:rollup2
WAS.

01:17:52.101 --> 01:17:56.172 region:rollup2
LISTENING VERY INTENTLY.

01:17:54.103 --> 01:17:58.207 region:rollup2
BUT I'M CONCERNED ONE.

01:17:56.172 --> 01:18:00.910 region:rollup2
STATEMENTS ARE BEING MADE BY

01:17:58.207 --> 01:18:02.144 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION SAYS.

01:18:00.910 --> 01:18:04.413 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT GOING TO SOLVE THE

01:18:02.144 --> 01:18:05.014 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

01:18:04.413 --> 01:18:06.649 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE SPENDING A HUNDRED

01:18:05.014 --> 01:18:08.517 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS SHARE.

01:18:06.649 --> 01:18:09.218 region:rollup2
SO.

01:18:08.517 --> 01:18:10.553 region:rollup2
BUT WE'RE NOT SOLVING THE

01:18:09.218 --> 01:18:12.621 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WE IN THE HUNDRED

01:18:10.553 --> 01:18:13.656 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS.

01:18:12.621 --> 01:18:17.092 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT DOESN'T GIVE ME A

01:18:13.656 --> 01:18:18.260 region:rollup2
LOT OF COMFORT.

01:18:17.092 --> 01:18:19.795 region:rollup2
NOW I KNOW BECAUSE I ATTENDED A

01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:21.463 region:rollup2
FEW OF THEM.

01:18:19.795 --> 01:18:22.464 region:rollup2
WE HAD THE STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS

01:18:21.463 --> 01:18:23.799 region:rollup2
AROUND THE STATE ON ON THIS

01:18:22.464 --> 01:18:25.801 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

01:18:23.799 --> 01:18:27.002 region:rollup2
.

01:18:25.801 --> 01:18:29.138 region:rollup2
SO I GUESS FROM THE DEPARTMENT

01:18:27.002 --> 01:18:32.007 region:rollup2
OF EDUCATION. THE STAKEHOLDER

01:18:29.138 --> 01:18:33.609 region:rollup2
MEETINGS THAT WE CONDUCTED.

01:18:32.007 --> 01:18:37.246 region:rollup2
ARE THEY BEING CONSIDERED IN AND

01:18:33.609 --> 01:18:39.682 region:rollup2
TRYING TO SOLVE.

01:18:37.246 --> 01:18:40.382 region:rollup2
EFFORT AND ON BEHALF OF.

01:18:39.682 --> 01:18:41.350 region:rollup2
WRITTEN IT TOOK TO DO THINGS SO

01:18:40.382 --> 01:18:42.585 region:rollup2
WHEN IT WE DO THINK IT'S AN

01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:43.252 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT START TO SOLVING THE

01:18:42.585 --> 01:18:45.688 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WE THINK THERE ARE OTHER

01:18:43.252 --> 01:18:47.990 region:rollup2
THINGS. THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

01:18:45.688 --> 01:18:49.058 region:rollup2
TIME SO IT'S IN ITS INITIAL

01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:50.426 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK

01:18:49.058 --> 01:18:51.894 region:rollup2
AT MENTORSHIPS COMMUNITIES OF

01:18:50.426 --> 01:18:53.729 region:rollup2
PRACTICE OTHER WAYS TO SUPPORT

01:18:51.894 --> 01:18:54.763 region:rollup2
TEACHERS TO STAY AND SO. I WENT

01:18:53.729 --> 01:18:56.398 region:rollup2
THAT WE THINK IT'S A GOOD START

01:18:54.763 --> 01:18:58.067 region:rollup2
TO GETTING TO THE PROBLEM.

01:18:56.398 --> 01:18:59.134 region:rollup2
AND THEN TAKE IT I WOULD

01:18:58.067 --> 01:19:00.402 region:rollup2
DEFERRED TO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:18:59.134 --> 01:19:01.437 region:rollup2
FINANCE ON THE STAKEHOLDER

01:19:00.402 --> 01:19:01.937 region:rollup2
MEETINGS SINCE THEY WERE THE

MEETINGS.

01:19:04.273 --> 01:19:08.844 region:rollup2
BUT THOSE AYE INPUT SESSIONS.

01:19:07.376 --> 01:19:09.945 region:rollup2
WELL THE PART OF FINANCE TALKED

01:19:08.844 --> 01:19:11.347 region:rollup2

IT ABSOLUTELY DOES.

01:19:30.499 --> 01:19:33.335 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY SO WE'VE CHANGED THE

CREDENTIAL WHERE ADOPTING NEW

01:19:33.335 --> 01:19:36.705 region:rollup2
STANDARDS WE EXPECT AS EARLY AS

ARRIVES IN THE BUDGET JULY ONE

01:19:42.111 --> 01:19:44.647 region:rollup2
WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:19:43.245 --> 01:19:46.782 region:rollup2
STIMULATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF

01:19:44.647 --> 01:19:48.384 region:rollup2
RESIDENCY PROGRAMS.

01:19:46.782 --> 01:19:50.119 region:rollup2
THAT MEET THIS NEW.

01:19:48.384 --> 01:19:51.553 region:rollup2
CREDENTIALS STRUCTURE

01:19:50.119 --> 01:19:52.955 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME AS WE ARE

01:19:51.553 --> 01:19:54.356 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH ALL OF THE SPECIAL

01:19:52.955 --> 01:19:56.225 region:rollup2
EDUCATION PROGRAMS IN THE STATE

TO UPDATE TO NEW STANDARDS. THIS

01:19:56.225 --> 01:20:00.029 region:rollup2
WILL BE A STIMULUS IT'LL BE.

01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:01.397 region:rollup2
AN INCENTIVE REALLY IF YOU WILL

01:20:00.029 --> 01:20:02.765 region:rollup2
FOR LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES

01:20:01.397 --> 01:20:04.533 region:rollup2
THIS A SCHOOL DISTRICT BASED

01:20:02.765 --> 01:20:06.568 region:rollup2
FUNDING AND THE DISTRICT WILL BE

01:20:04.533 --> 01:20:08.237 region:rollup2
THE HOME OF THESE RESIDENCIES.

01:20:06.568 --> 01:20:09.805 region:rollup2
SO THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD

01:20:08.237 --> 01:20:11.507 region:rollup2
THEIR CAPACITY TO TRAIN THEIR

01:20:09.805 --> 01:20:13.509 region:rollup2
OWN TEACHERS.

01:20:11.507 --> 01:20:15.311 region:rollup2
IN PARTNERSHIP WITH VOTE WITH A

01:20:13.509 --> 01:20:17.313 region:rollup2
TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAM IS

01:20:15.311 --> 01:20:19.615 region:rollup2
THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT

01:20:17.313 --> 01:20:21.717 region:rollup2
HERE I TERMS OF JUST BUILDING

01:20:19.615 --> 01:20:24.053 region:rollup2
THE CAPACITY OF THE SYSTEM.

01:20:21.717 --> 01:20:25.688 region:rollup2
AT AND WE'RE VERY EXCITED TO

01:20:24.053 --> 01:20:27.323 region:rollup2
BUILD THAT AND IT WILL BE WE SEE

01:20:25.688 --> 01:20:28.457 region:rollup2
THESE THINGS MERGING WE HAVE

01:20:27.323 --> 01:20:30.225 region:rollup2
THREE THINGS THAT ARE MERGING AT

01:20:28.457 --> 01:20:31.827 region:rollup2
THE SAME TIME. THE EXPANSION OF

01:20:30.225 --> 01:20:33.295 region:rollup2
MULTI TIERED SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT

01:20:31.827 --> 01:20:33.796 region:rollup2
WHICH IS A NEW VISION FOR HOW WE

01:20:33.295 --> 01:20:35.597 region:rollup2
DELIVER SERVICES TO ALL

01:20:33.796 --> 01:20:36.699 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

01:20:35.597 --> 01:20:38.867 region:rollup2
THE CHANGE IN THE SPECIAL

01:20:36.699 --> 01:20:40.703 region:rollup2
EDUCATION CREDENTIAL WHICH FEEDS

01:20:38.867 --> 01:20:42.037 region:rollup2
INTO THAT IDEA THAT ALL TEACHERS

01:20:40.703 --> 01:20:44.440 region:rollup2
ARE TEACHERS OF ALL STUDENTS AND

01:20:42.037 --> 01:20:46.141 region:rollup2
THEY ALL HAVE SOME WORK TO DO IN

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:47.509 region:rollup2
A GEN ED INCLUDED SPACE.

01:20:46.141 --> 01:20:49.678 region:rollup2
AND THEN THIRDLY AT THE

01:20:47.509 --> 01:20:51.647 region:rollup2
EXCELLENT THAT FUNDING WILL

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:52.681 region:rollup2
PROVIDE TO RECRUIT TEACHERS INTO

01:20:51.647 --> 01:20:54.750 region:rollup2
THESE NEW PATHWAYS OF

01:20:52.681 --> 01:20:56.752 region:rollup2
PREPARATION ND TO ENABLE SCHOOL

01:20:54.750 --> 01:21:00.856 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS TO TO PROVIDE SOME

01:20:56.752 --> 01:21:01.523 region:rollup2
INCENTIVE TO HIRE THEM. KNOW

01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:02.124 region:rollup2
THAT LEGEND LIST IS RAISE SOME

01:21:01.523 --> 01:21:02.791 region:rollup2
OTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER

01:21:02.124 --> 01:21:04.259 region:rollup2
COMPENSATION IS THE BIGGER ISSUE

01:21:02.791 --> 01:21:05.327 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM THAT WE CAN

01:21:04.259 --> 01:21:06.462 region:rollup2
SOLVE.

01:21:05.327 --> 01:21:08.364 region:rollup2
A THAT'S A MUCH BIGGER

01:21:06.462 --> 01:21:10.332 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION THAN THAN THIS IS

01:21:08.364 --> 01:21:12.101 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT THIS WILL DO IS BRING

01:21:10.332 --> 01:21:13.869 region:rollup2
FIVE THOUSAND SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:21:12.101 --> 01:21:14.703 region:rollup2
TEACHERS IN. TO HOPEFULLY

01:21:13.869 --> 01:21:16.105 region:rollup2
REPLACE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:21:14.703 --> 01:21:17.373 region:rollup2
SERVING ON ON EMERGENCY PERMITS

01:21:16.105 --> 01:21:18.741 region:rollup2
IN THOSE SETTINGS

01:21:17.373 --> 01:21:20.509 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING

01:21:18.741 --> 01:21:22.411 region:rollup2
FOR US TO DO I I WOULD JUST

01:21:20.509 --> 01:21:24.012 region:rollup2
ARGUE THAT THAT THAT IT'S IT'S A

01:21:22.411 --> 01:21:25.914 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT TIMELY.

01:21:24.012 --> 01:21:27.616 region:rollup2
MERGE OF THREE VERY IMPORTANT

01:21:25.914 --> 01:21:29.318 region:rollup2
IDEAS.

01:21:27.616 --> 01:21:31.754 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK AREGOING TO BE

01:21:29.318 --> 01:21:33.322 region:rollup2
TRANSFORMATIVE FOR THE SCHOOLS.

01:21:31.754 --> 01:21:34.790 region:rollup2
NOW FOR THE LA ELKS I WOULD GET

01:21:33.322 --> 01:21:35.657 region:rollup2
IT IS TO WAY USERS THE.

01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:37.659 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE OF MONEY THAT WE'RE

01:21:35.657 --> 01:21:38.994 region:rollup2
PUTTING IN.

01:21:37.659 --> 01:21:40.229 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S ALSO THE ISSUE AND I

01:21:38.994 --> 01:21:42.064 region:rollup2
THINK THE LA A BROUGHT IT UP AS

01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:44.099 region:rollup2
FAR AS THE.

01:21:42.064 --> 01:21:44.666 region:rollup2
THE STRUCTURE OR HOW WE DEVELOP.

01:21:44.099 --> 01:21:47.870 region:rollup2
PEOPLE GOING INTO THIS THIS

01:21:44.666 --> 01:21:50.005 region:rollup2
AREA.

01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:51.073 region:rollup2
AND ALSO I'VE READ REPORT

01:21:50.005 --> 01:21:52.274 region:rollup2
BELIEVE YOU KNOW LOOKING AT THE

01:21:51.073 --> 01:21:52.741 region:rollup2
WORLD TO SEE ISSUES ARE GOING TO

01:21:52.274 --> 01:21:54.476 region:rollup2
PLAY THIS ROLE THANK.

01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:56.712 region:rollup2
SO.

01:21:54.476 --> 01:21:58.280 region:rollup2
FROM AN ALLEY ó PERSPECTIVE.

01:21:56.712 --> 01:21:59.348 region:rollup2
DO YOU AGREE THAT WAS JUST

01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:00.816 region:rollup2
PRESENTED BY.

01:21:59.348 --> 01:22:03.519 region:rollup2
DOCTOR SANDY TO WE MISSING

01:22:00.816 --> 01:22:04.887 region:rollup2
SOMETHING.

01:22:03.519 --> 01:22:07.022 region:rollup2
THEY SHE SHE OUTLINED IT THIS

01:22:04.887 --> 01:22:08.157 region:rollup2
THIS SYSTEMIC OF THE PROBLEM

01:22:07.022 --> 01:22:09.491 region:rollup2
SHE SAYS SHE'S GOT A PLAN TO

01:22:08.157 --> 01:22:11.427 region:rollup2
TRANSITION TO GO THERE AND

01:22:09.491 --> 01:22:12.861 region:rollup2
YOU'RE SAYING. NO WE'RE NOT WE

01:22:11.427 --> 01:22:14.530 region:rollup2
NEED TO PAY MORE BUT ALSO THE

01:22:12.861 --> 01:22:16.965 region:rollup2
SYSTEM AND I WE COULD ACTUALIZED

01:22:14.530 --> 01:22:18.167 region:rollup2
PROBLEM SO.

01:22:16.965 --> 01:22:21.203 region:rollup2
THIS YOU HAVE THE PATHWAY TO

01:22:18.167 --> 01:22:22.337 region:rollup2
SOLUTION OR YOU THINK NOT.

01:22:21.203 --> 01:22:24.506 region:rollup2
I THINK WHAT I HEARD IS THAT THE

01:22:22.337 --> 01:22:26.508 region:rollup2
COMMISSION AS AN INSTITUTION US

01:22:24.506 --> 01:22:28.944 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH AND AT STATUTORY

01:22:26.508 --> 01:22:30.913 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK TO.

01:22:28.944 --> 01:22:32.614 region:rollup2
DO SOME THINGS TO SIMPLIFY THE

01:22:30.913 --> 01:22:35.484 region:rollup2
CREDENTIAL PROCESS

01:22:32.614 --> 01:22:36.852 region:rollup2
I THINK MANY LAYMAN'S REACTION

01:22:35.484 --> 01:22:37.853 region:rollup2
LIKE MINE AS WELL IT'S STILL

01:22:36.852 --> 01:22:39.621 region:rollup2
SOME COMPLICATED WELL I STILL

01:22:37.853 --> 01:22:41.690 region:rollup2
NEED TO DO THAT IF I WANT TO

01:22:39.621 --> 01:22:42.624 region:rollup2
LEARN THAT'S. IF I WANT TO SOME

01:22:41.690 --> 01:22:44.226 region:rollup2
DAY WORK WITH.

01:22:42.624 --> 01:22:46.195 region:rollup2
VISUALLY IMPAIRED STUDENTS I DO

01:22:44.226 --> 01:22:48.297 region:rollup2
NEED EXTRA WORK EVEN IF IT'S NOT

01:22:46.195 --> 01:22:49.765 region:rollup2
STARTING OVER I NEED TO DO

01:22:48.297 --> 01:22:51.967 region:rollup2
SOMETHING EXTRA.

01:22:49.765 --> 01:22:53.535 region:rollup2
AND. I THINK OUR PERSPECTIVE IS

01:22:51.967 --> 01:22:55.504 region:rollup2
ALSO THE LEGISLATURE HAS TRIED

01:22:53.535 --> 01:22:56.638 region:rollup2
MANY THINGS ARE MORE THAN FORTY

01:22:55.504 --> 01:22:57.973 region:rollup2
YEARS DOWN THE ROAD AND WE STILL

01:22:56.638 --> 01:22:59.408 region:rollup2
HAVE PROBLEMS AND I THINK SOME

01:22:57.973 --> 01:23:00.476 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THINK THE PROBLEM IS JUST

01:22:59.408 --> 01:23:01.043 region:rollup2
A SERIOUS TODAY HASN'T SUFFERED

01:23:00.476 --> 01:23:03.412 region:rollup2
BAN.

01:23:01.043 --> 01:23:05.414 region:rollup2
SUCH THAT.

01:23:03.412 --> 01:23:07.316 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD IT TAKE AND I THINK

01:23:05.414 --> 01:23:07.883 region:rollup2
AGAIN TO PRODUCE MORE SPECIAL ED

01:23:07.316 --> 01:23:14.423 region:rollup2
TEACHERS TIRED AND THEY KNOW

01:23:07.883 --> 01:23:16.692 region:rollup2
THEY CAN

01:23:14.423 --> 01:23:17.960 region:rollup2
GET

01:23:16.692 --> 01:23:18.927 region:rollup2
THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY BY

01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:21.663 region:rollup2
SHUFFLING CLASSROOMS TWO DOORS

01:23:18.927 --> 01:23:23.298 region:rollup2
DOWN? OR LEAVE THE PROFESSION

01:23:21.663 --> 01:23:24.366 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY WERE WELL SUPPORTED

01:23:23.298 --> 01:23:25.267 region:rollup2
TO BEGUN WENT OFF AND THEY'RE

01:23:24.366 --> 01:23:26.301 region:rollup2
TIRED AND THEY CAN GET PAID

01:23:25.267 --> 01:23:28.170 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIALLY MORE DOING

01:23:26.301 --> 01:23:30.572 region:rollup2
SOMETHING ELSE.

01:23:28.170 --> 01:23:33.242 region:rollup2
SO I THINK IF THE STATE WANTS TO

01:23:30.572 --> 01:23:35.344 region:rollup2
BE IN A DIFFERENT POSITION YEARS

01:23:33.242 --> 01:23:37.012 region:rollup2
FROM NOW AND HOW SO I I WOULD

01:23:35.344 --> 01:23:38.180 region:rollup2
SUGGEST CONSIDER.

01:23:37.012 --> 01:23:39.381 region:rollup2
WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO GET SPECIAL

01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:40.282 region:rollup2
ED TEACHERS NOT JUST TO BE WELL

01:23:39.381 --> 01:23:42.217 region:rollup2
PREPARED TO BEGIN WITH BUT TO

01:23:40.282 --> 01:23:42.784 region:rollup2
STAY IN THEIR JOBS?

01:23:42.217 --> 01:23:43.986 region:rollup2
TO GET BETTER AND BETTER AT

01:23:42.784 --> 01:23:45.821 region:rollup2
DOING THEIR JOBS.

01:23:43.986 --> 01:23:46.421 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S A DIFFICULT

01:23:45.821 --> 01:23:47.222 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION BUT I DON'T THINK

01:23:46.421 --> 01:23:48.390 region:rollup2
AN IMPOSSIBLE CONVERSATION I

01:23:47.222 --> 01:23:49.825 region:rollup2
THINK THAT TEACHERS AND

01:23:48.390 --> 01:23:52.160 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATORS AND YOU CAN SHARE

01:23:49.825 --> 01:23:54.196 region:rollup2
THE SAME PERSPECTIVE OF NOT

01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:54.763 region:rollup2
WANTING TO BE IN THE SAME PLACE

01:23:54.196 --> 01:23:57.432 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN YEARS FROM NOW FIVE

01:23:54.763 --> 01:23:58.567 region:rollup2
YEARS.

01:23:57.432 --> 01:24:03.972 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I'M HERE IN THIS DAY AND

01:23:58.567 --> 01:24:04.573 region:rollup2
THE IN.

01:24:03.972 --> 01:24:05.173 region:rollup2
WELL IF YOU'RE GOING TO DIRECT

01:24:04.573 --> 01:24:05.674 region:rollup2
THIS QUESTION TO.

01:24:05.173 --> 01:24:06.008 region:rollup2
WE KNOW IT'S A PROBLEM.

01:24:05.674 --> 01:24:08.744 region:rollup2
FORTY YEARS.

01:24:06.008 --> 01:24:10.212 region:rollup2
I.

01:24:08.744 --> 01:24:10.746 region:rollup2
SOFTLY UNDERSTANDING THE TRUNK

01:24:10.212 --> 01:24:11.980 region:rollup2
METHOD YOU'RE TRYING TO DO

01:24:10.746 --> 01:24:12.547 region:rollup2
FOR

01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:14.249 region:rollup2
CREDENTIALING YOUR AND YOUR

01:24:12.547 --> 01:24:15.651 region:rollup2
DRESSING THIS

01:24:14.249 --> 01:24:18.353 region:rollup2
IS THAT MIX OF IT.

01:24:15.651 --> 01:24:19.755 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO READING THE REPORTS AND

01:24:18.353 --> 01:24:21.390 region:rollup2
HAVING GONE TO THE MEETINGS.

01:24:19.755 --> 01:24:23.592 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE TWO BIG AREAS THAT I

01:24:21.390 --> 01:24:24.092 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK DISCOVERS HOW MUCH

01:24:23.592 --> 01:24:26.428 region:rollup2
IN CRACKING FROM WRONG

01:24:24.092 --> 01:24:27.029 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

01:24:26.428 --> 01:24:27.996 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH THE

01:24:27.029 --> 01:24:29.765 region:rollup2
ROOT ISSUE OF HOW YOU GET

01:24:27.996 --> 01:24:30.666 region:rollup2
CREDENTIALING TRAIN PEOPLE WITH

01:24:29.765 --> 01:24:31.900 region:rollup2
THIS EMPTY SS.

01:24:30.666 --> 01:24:33.569 region:rollup2
BUT WE ALSO NEED TO COMPENSATE.

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:35.504 region:rollup2
PEOPLE IN THIS AREA.

01:24:33.569 --> 01:24:37.306 region:rollup2
AND ADDITIONALLY WE NEED TO.

01:24:35.504 --> 01:24:39.408 region:rollup2
DEVELOP SOME SUPPORT APPRENTICE

01:24:37.306 --> 01:24:40.275 region:rollup2
MENTORSHIP PROGRAM.

01:24:39.408 --> 01:24:41.643 region:rollup2
SO THAT WHEN YOUNG PEOPLE GO

01:24:40.275 --> 01:24:43.045 region:rollup2
INTO THIS.

01:24:41.643 --> 01:24:45.314 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE SUCCESSFUL.

01:24:43.045 --> 01:24:46.715 region:rollup2
DOES.

01:24:45.314 --> 01:24:47.716 region:rollup2
YOUR PROPOSAL OF A HUNDRED

01:24:46.715 --> 01:24:51.820 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS MEET ALL THREE

01:24:47.716 --> 01:24:53.355 region:rollup2
OF THOSE.

01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:54.790 region:rollup2
ARE ONLY ONE OF THEM OR.

01:24:53.355 --> 01:24:55.557 region:rollup2
WHAT IS IT DO?

01:24:54.790 --> 01:24:56.892 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY LAID OUT THE

01:24:55.557 --> 01:24:57.459 region:rollup2
SOLUTION SO.

01:24:56.892 --> 01:24:58.760 region:rollup2
WHEN LIKE THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:24:57.459 --> 01:25:01.363 region:rollup2
FINE.

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:02.831 region:rollup2
SO REGARDING BUILDING CAPACITY.

01:25:01.363 --> 01:25:04.533 region:rollup2
TO ACTUALLY TRAIN

01:25:02.831 --> 01:25:07.569 region:rollup2
SPECIAL ED TEACHERS.

01:25:04.533 --> 01:25:11.273 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS ADDRESS THE

01:25:07.569 --> 01:25:11.940 region:rollup2
OKAY THAT'S THE CREDIT THAT'S.

01:25:11.273 --> 01:25:12.407 region:rollup2
DOCTOR CHENEY'S POSITIONAL KIND

01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:13.241 region:rollup2
OF ANYONE PRESENT THE

01:25:12.407 --> 01:25:14.409 region:rollup2
RESIDENCIES OR EVEN THE LOCAL

01:25:13.241 --> 01:25:16.078 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS IF THEY DID GROW YOUR

01:25:14.409 --> 01:25:16.578 region:rollup2
OWN PROGRAMS WITH WITH THAT

01:25:16.078 --> 01:25:19.247 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR INVESTMENT.

01:25:16.578 --> 01:25:20.615 region:rollup2
WOULD ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF THE

01:25:19.247 --> 01:25:21.783 region:rollup2
THE PREPARATION AND RETENTION.

01:25:20.615 --> 01:25:23.652 region:rollup2
I'M FROM A PREPARATION

01:25:21.783 --> 01:25:25.554 region:rollup2
STANDPOINT. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO

01:25:23.652 --> 01:25:26.855 region:rollup2
SALARY.

01:25:25.554 --> 01:25:28.123 region:rollup2
THAT IS A LOCAL DECISION IN

01:25:26.855 --> 01:25:31.259 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA

01:25:28.123 --> 01:25:33.628 region:rollup2
STATUTE WHILE IT DOES SPECIFY A

01:25:31.259 --> 01:25:36.598 region:rollup2
CERTAIN TYPE OF SALARY SCHEDULE

01:25:33.628 --> 01:25:38.900 region:rollup2
FOR TEACHERS IT ALSO PROVIDES.

01:25:36.598 --> 01:25:40.869 region:rollup2
THE AUTHORITY FOR LOCAL

01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:43.138 region:rollup2
EDUCATION AGENCIES TO IDENTIFY

01:25:40.869 --> 01:25:46.141 region:rollup2
ANY GROUP OF TEACHERS OR.

01:25:43.138 --> 01:25:47.809 region:rollup2
A TYPE OF TEACHER AND PAY THEM

01:25:46.141 --> 01:25:48.810 region:rollup2
MORE BASED ON THE WORK THAT THEY

01:25:47.809 --> 01:25:51.046 region:rollup2
DO.

01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:52.848 region:rollup2
AND SO.

01:25:51.046 --> 01:25:54.850 region:rollup2
UNDER CURRENT STATUE.

01:25:52.848 --> 01:25:57.219 region:rollup2
LOCALS HAVE AUTHORITY TO PAY

01:25:54.850 --> 01:25:58.854 region:rollup2
SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS WHAT

01:25:57.219 --> 01:26:01.356 region:rollup2
THEY FEEL THEY NEED TO IN ORDER

01:25:58.854 --> 01:26:03.692 region:rollup2
TO.

01:26:01.356 --> 01:26:04.659 region:rollup2
COMPENSATE THEM FOR THE.

01:26:03.692 --> 01:26:06.928 region:rollup2
THE ONEROUS NESS OF THE.

01:26:04.659 --> 01:26:08.630 region:rollup2
POSITION.

01:26:06.928 --> 01:26:10.332 region:rollup2
NOT THE STATE AT THIS TIME

01:26:08.630 --> 01:26:12.067 region:rollup2
DOESN'T DICTATE.

01:26:10.332 --> 01:26:14.336 region:rollup2
SALARIES FOR TEACHERS AT THE

01:26:12.067 --> 01:26:16.705 region:rollup2
LOCAL LEVEL THAT IS SO

01:26:14.336 --> 01:26:17.973 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND EVIDENCE WHICH.

01:26:16.705 --> 01:26:21.376 region:rollup2
POLYGAMIST A WHERE PERSPECTIVE

01:26:17.973 --> 01:26:23.111 region:rollup2
OF PEOPLE GOING IN THIS CASE IF

01:26:21.376 --> 01:26:24.079 region:rollup2
WE PUT HIM INTO THE PIPELINE.

01:26:23.111 --> 01:26:25.714 region:rollup2
BUT IT WOULD PUT HIM UP TO VALUE

01:26:24.079 --> 01:26:26.715 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY THEY DON'T HAVE THE

01:26:25.714 --> 01:26:28.817 region:rollup2
SUPPORT STRUCTURE BE THEY'RE NOT

01:26:26.715 --> 01:26:29.985 region:rollup2
BEING COMPENSATED. ASSUME WHY AM

01:26:28.817 --> 01:26:31.486 region:rollup2
I DOING THIS WHEN I CAN GO. BACK

01:26:29.985 --> 01:26:33.388 region:rollup2
TO TEACH ENGLISH AND NOT EVEN

01:26:31.486 --> 01:26:33.989 region:rollup2
DEAL WITH THIS.

01:26:33.388 --> 01:26:34.656 region:rollup2
DOCTORS AND IS THAT A LITTLE

01:26:33.989 --> 01:26:35.791 region:rollup2
MORE PERSPECTIVE ON THIS I THINK

01:26:34.656 --> 01:26:37.859 region:rollup2
THAT THIS HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR

01:26:35.791 --> 01:26:38.694 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL COMPLIMENTS OTHER

01:26:37.859 --> 01:26:41.530 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS THAT THIS

01:26:38.694 --> 01:26:43.699 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE'S MAY. INVESTMENT TO

01:26:41.530 --> 01:26:45.200 region:rollup2
GROW AND ACCELERATE M. TSS.

01:26:43.699 --> 01:26:46.601 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE STATE IS A

01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:48.603 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT FOUNDATIONAL PART OF

01:26:46.601 --> 01:26:50.539 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:26:48.603 --> 01:26:52.307 region:rollup2
SO WE ARE CHANGING THE WAY WE

01:26:50.539 --> 01:26:53.308 region:rollup2
DELIVER SERVICES TO KIDS WHEN

01:26:52.307 --> 01:26:55.143 region:rollup2
WE'RE IN WITH SCHOOLS THAT ARE

01:26:53.308 --> 01:26:56.845 region:rollup2
USING ON TSS IN WAYS THAT ARE

01:26:55.143 --> 01:26:57.779 region:rollup2
VERY POSITIVE I'VE HEARD FROM

01:26:56.845 --> 01:26:58.980 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE

01:26:57.779 --> 01:27:00.182 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTING IT. WHERE THEIR

01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:01.950 region:rollup2
PARENTS WERE SAYING CAN I TAKE

01:27:00.182 --> 01:27:03.485 region:rollup2
MY KID OUT ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I

01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:04.786 region:rollup2
WANT THEM TO BE IN M. T. SS WHAT

01:27:03.485 --> 01:27:06.955 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS THAT

01:27:04.786 --> 01:27:08.857 region:rollup2
MTS ES IS STILL INCLUDE SPECIAL

01:27:06.955 --> 01:27:11.159 region:rollup2
ED? BUT IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN RE

01:27:08.857 --> 01:27:13.061 region:rollup2
CONCEPTUALIZE AS MULTI TIERED

01:27:11.159 --> 01:27:14.696 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT IT EVERY KID

01:27:13.061 --> 01:27:17.265 region:rollup2
IS GOING TO NEED SOME ASPECT OF

01:27:14.696 --> 01:27:17.799 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THAT IT AND THEN THEY

01:27:17.265 --> 01:27:19.401 region:rollup2
THEY ALL MOVE WITHIN THAT

01:27:17.799 --> 01:27:20.836 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

01:27:19.401 --> 01:27:22.404 region:rollup2
IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T FEEL SILO

01:27:20.836 --> 01:27:24.239 region:rollup2
THAT DOESN'T FEEL.

01:27:22.404 --> 01:27:25.240 region:rollup2
LIKE THEY ARE LESS THAN THE

01:27:24.239 --> 01:27:26.641 region:rollup2
OTHER STUDENTS AROUND THEM

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:27.743 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY'S AGENDA AT STUDENT

01:27:26.641 --> 01:27:28.744 region:rollup2
AND THEY GET THE SERVICES THEY

01:27:27.743 --> 01:27:31.079 region:rollup2
NEED THAT'S A CRITICAL

01:27:28.744 --> 01:27:32.614 region:rollup2
FOUNDATION. WHAT THIS WILL DO IS

01:27:31.079 --> 01:27:33.815 region:rollup2
BRING MORE TEACHERS AND NOW I'VE

01:27:32.614 --> 01:27:35.417 region:rollup2
BEEN OUT VISITING SCHOOLS?

01:27:33.815 --> 01:27:37.018 region:rollup2
IN TALKING TO TEACHERS IN

01:27:35.417 --> 01:27:38.487 region:rollup2
TRAINING WENT TO THE LONG BEACH

A TO A SCHOOL IN LONG BEACH.

01:27:38.487 --> 01:27:41.556 region:rollup2
WHERE WE SAW ABOUT THIRTY

01:27:39.688 --> 01:27:42.557 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT CANDIDATES WHO ARE

01:27:41.556 --> 01:27:44.392 region:rollup2
SPONSORED BY CAL STATE LONG

01:27:42.557 --> 01:27:45.193 region:rollup2
BEACH? THEY'RE EARNING BOTH

01:27:44.392 --> 01:27:46.461 region:rollup2
THEIR GENERAL ED AND THEIR

01:27:45.193 --> 01:27:47.696 region:rollup2
SPECIAL ED CREDENTIAL IN THERE

01:27:46.461 --> 01:27:49.264 region:rollup2
DOING THEIR TRADE THEIR STUDENT

WHEN THEY WOULD TAKE. ALL OF

SPECIAL A JOB THEY ARE HUNGRY

01:27:59.307 --> 01:28:02.210 region:rollup2
FOR IT THEY KNOW WHAT IT IS THEY

01:28:01.076 --> 01:28:03.311 region:rollup2
KNOW WHO THE STUDENTS ARE AND

01:28:02.210 --> 01:28:04.146 region:rollup2
THEY WANT TO SERVE THEM AND THEY

01:28:03.311 --> 01:28:06.581 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT THEY CAN THEY'RE

01:28:04.146 --> 01:28:07.916 region:rollup2
GETTING WELL TRAINED. TO DO SO

01:28:06.581 --> 01:28:09.351 region:rollup2
AND GIVEN THE CHOICE THAT'S WHAT

01:28:07.916 --> 01:28:10.785 region:rollup2
THEY'RE CHOOSING SO WHEN I HEAR

01:28:09.351 --> 01:28:12.854 region:rollup2
FROM TEACHERS SPECIAL ED

01:28:10.785 --> 01:28:13.889 region:rollup2
TEACHERS WHO ARE WEARY. AND TWO

01:28:12.854 --> 01:28:14.923 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT THEY RAISE ALL THE

01:28:13.889 --> 01:28:16.792 region:rollup2
TIME BUT I AND I DON'T HEAR

01:28:14.923 --> 01:28:17.559 region:rollup2
COMPENSATION MAYBE BECAUSE THEY

01:28:16.792 --> 01:28:20.428 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S AN INSOLUBLE

01:28:17.559 --> 01:28:21.863 region:rollup2
PROBLEM BUT I HEAR CASELOAD. IS

01:28:20.428 --> 01:28:23.498 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT THE NUMBER OF

01:28:21.863 --> 01:28:24.566 region:rollup2
STUDENTS THAT THEY HAVE TO

01:28:23.498 --> 01:28:26.868 region:rollup2
MANAGE TE IT PIECE FOR IS

01:28:24.566 --> 01:28:27.469 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT FOR THEM. AND THAT'S

01:28:26.868 --> 01:28:29.070 region:rollup2
A FUNCTION OF SHORTAGE

01:28:27.469 --> 01:28:31.039 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TEACHERS TO

01:28:29.070 --> 01:28:32.474 region:rollup2
SHARE THE CASELOAD OUT THERE.

01:28:31.039 --> 01:28:34.509 region:rollup2
AND WE NEED MORE AND THIS IS A

01:28:32.474 --> 01:28:36.411 region:rollup2
SOLUTION STRATEGY FOR THAT THE

01:28:34.509 --> 01:28:38.013 region:rollup2
OTHER THING I HEAR IS PAPERWORK.

01:28:36.411 --> 01:28:39.614 region:rollup2
OF THE AMOUNT OF PAPERWORK THAT

01:28:38.013 --> 01:28:41.116 region:rollup2
SPECIAL EDUCATION CREATOR HAS TO

01:28:39.614 --> 01:28:43.251 region:rollup2
DO THE TAKES AWAY FROM THE

01:28:41.116 --> 01:28:45.187 region:rollup2
SERVICES TO KIDS.

01:28:43.251 --> 01:28:46.354 region:rollup2
IT IT MAKES THEM WEARY AND IT'S

01:28:45.187 --> 01:28:48.023 region:rollup2
NOT THE WORK THEY SIGNED UP TO

01:28:46.354 --> 01:28:49.391 region:rollup2
DO THEY WANT TO WORK WITH YOUNG

01:28:48.023 --> 01:28:50.959 region:rollup2
PEOPLE SO THAT'S A SOLUTION

01:28:49.391 --> 01:28:52.160 region:rollup2
WE'RE LOOKING FOR IT IS POSSIBLE

01:28:50.959 --> 01:28:54.062 region:rollup2
TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT WAYS OF

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:55.430 region:rollup2
MANAGING. THE PAPERWORK

01:28:54.062 --> 01:28:57.065 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIAL

01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:57.933 region:rollup2
EDUCATION BY HAVING OTHER

01:28:57.065 --> 01:28:59.768 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WERE TRAINED TO DO

01:28:57.933 --> 01:29:01.870 region:rollup2
SO WE THINK THAT'S A THAT'S A

01:28:59.768 --> 01:29:02.070 region:rollup2
BAY AREA WE NEED TO EXPLORE MORE

01:29:01.870 --> 01:29:03.705 region:rollup2
FULLY.

01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:06.241 region:rollup2
.

01:29:03.705 --> 01:29:07.976 region:rollup2
BUT ALL OF THIS WILL BE AIDED BY

01:29:06.241 --> 01:29:09.845 region:rollup2
HAVING MORE FULLY PREPARED

01:29:07.976 --> 01:29:11.246 region:rollup2
SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS IN

01:29:09.845 --> 01:29:12.514 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM TO SHARE THE LOAD.

01:29:11.246 --> 01:29:14.082 region:rollup2
AND YOU WERE TRAINED IN THE WAY

01:29:12.514 --> 01:29:15.984 region:rollup2
OF THINKING ABOUT AND DELIVERING

01:29:14.082 --> 01:29:17.686 region:rollup2
SERVICES THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:29:15.984 --> 01:29:20.689 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONALIST LATER HAVE BEEN

01:29:17.686 --> 01:29:21.489 region:rollup2
WORKING ON AN EMPTY SS.

01:29:20.689 --> 01:29:23.558 region:rollup2
YEAH WELL THIS IS IMPORTANT TO

01:29:21.489 --> 01:29:24.993 region:rollup2
ME YOU KNOW I I THINK PETE

01:29:23.558 --> 01:29:26.061 region:rollup2
TEACHERS WHO GO INTO THIS AREA

01:29:24.993 --> 01:29:27.629 region:rollup2
SPECIAL ED.

01:29:26.061 --> 01:29:29.331 region:rollup2
OUR OUR SPECIAL AND THEY DO IT

01:29:27.629 --> 01:29:30.765 region:rollup2
FOR A REASON.

01:29:29.331 --> 01:29:33.902 region:rollup2
I USE MY DAUGHTER'S AN EXAMPLE

01:29:30.765 --> 01:29:35.203 region:rollup2
SHE'S ONE. AND I ASK YOU KNOW

01:29:33.902 --> 01:29:36.671 region:rollup2
WHAT IN SHE TOTALLY DIFFERENT

01:29:35.203 --> 01:29:37.973 region:rollup2
AND MADE SHE JUST.

01:29:36.671 --> 01:29:38.640 region:rollup2
VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT SEEN

01:29:37.973 --> 01:29:41.743 region:rollup2
SUCCESSES FOR THESE CHILDREN SO.

01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:44.012 region:rollup2

ANY I'VE KNOWN KENTUCKY FOR

01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:48.450 region:rollup2
YEARS BUT THE.

01:29:46.481 --> 01:29:51.386 region:rollup2
YOU THINK THIS IS A.

01:29:48.450 --> 01:29:53.822 region:rollup2
RIGHT PATH AGO I DO.

THANK YOU AYE IM'S AYE A FINAL

01:29:53.822 --> 01:29:56.224 region:rollup2

01:29:54.823 --> 01:29:57.158 region:rollup2
THE THINGS AGAIN MANY OF THE

01:29:56.224 --> 01:29:59.794 region:rollup2
THINGS ARE CARRYING PAPERWORK

01:29:57.158 --> 01:30:01.096 region:rollup2
CASELOAD PAID. ONGOING ISSUES

01:29:59.794 --> 01:30:02.530 region:rollup2
AND I THINK.

01:30:01.096 --> 01:30:03.565 region:rollup2
THE COMMISSION MIGHT BE TRYING

01:30:02.530 --> 01:30:04.733 region:rollup2
TO PUT SOME OF THE BEST LIGHT

01:30:03.565 --> 01:30:06.001 region:rollup2
WHAT COULD A DISTRICT

01:30:04.733 --> 01:30:07.836 region:rollup2
REALISTICALLY DO WITH THESE

01:30:06.001 --> 01:30:08.870 region:rollup2
FUNDS BUT IF YOU LISTEN TO

01:30:07.836 --> 01:30:10.705 region:rollup2
FINANCES PROPOSAL THERE

01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:12.841 region:rollup2
REQUIRING DISTRICTS TO DO THOSE

01:30:10.705 --> 01:30:14.142 region:rollup2
THINGS WORRY DISTRICT TO DO THEN

01:30:12.841 --> 01:30:16.011 region:rollup2
YOU MIGHT GET A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:30:14.142 --> 01:30:17.012 region:rollup2
THAN YOU OTHERWISE WOULD. BUT

01:30:16.011 --> 01:30:18.546 region:rollup2
UNDER THE LOCAL SOLUTIONS

01:30:17.012 --> 01:30:20.048 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED TO DO

01:30:18.546 --> 01:30:22.017 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WITH MULTI STEERED TO

01:30:20.048 --> 01:30:23.852 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT THEY'RE NOT

01:30:22.017 --> 01:30:24.986 region:rollup2
REQUIRED TO IMPROVE THEIR HR

01:30:23.852 --> 01:30:26.388 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED TO GO TO

01:30:24.986 --> 01:30:27.722 region:rollup2
THE TABLE ON THINK ABOUT

01:30:26.388 --> 01:30:29.224 region:rollup2
SIMPLIFYING OUR PAPERWORK

01:30:27.722 --> 01:30:30.191 region:rollup2
PROCESS IS.

01:30:29.224 --> 01:30:31.927 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU WANNA IF SOMETHING

01:30:30.191 --> 01:30:33.161 region:rollup2
YOU'RE IT IS RESONATING WITH YOU

01:30:31.927 --> 01:30:35.263 region:rollup2
YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO THAT THING

01:30:33.161 --> 01:30:37.499 region:rollup2
AS OPPOSED TO JUST LETTING LOCAL

01:30:35.263 --> 01:30:39.467 region:rollup2
SUBMIT PLANS TO DO. THINGS I

01:30:37.499 --> 01:30:40.068 region:rollup2
THINK IMPORTANT WILL DEPART

01:30:39.467 --> 01:30:40.568 region:rollup2
FINANCE YOU BE WILLING TO PUT

01:30:40.068 --> 01:30:42.771 region:rollup2
THOSE.

01:30:40.568 --> 01:30:47.242 region:rollup2
COMPONENTS.

01:30:42.771 --> 01:30:48.677 region:rollup2
AND THE NEW REVISED.

01:30:47.242 --> 01:30:51.346 region:rollup2
I THINK SOME OF THE THINGS THAT

01:30:48.677 --> 01:30:53.615 region:rollup2
THE ALEJO HAS JUST MENTIONED.

01:30:51.346 --> 01:30:54.916 region:rollup2
ARE ACTUALLY BEING IMPLEMENTED

01:30:53.615 --> 01:30:55.950 region:rollup2
THROUGH.

01:30:54.916 --> 01:30:58.253 region:rollup2
OTHER PROPOSALS IN THE

01:30:55.950 --> 01:31:00.088 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET.

01:30:58.253 --> 01:31:02.824 region:rollup2
SO FOR EXAMPLE.

01:31:00.088 --> 01:31:04.192 region:rollup2
THE MTS SAYS THAT'S

01:31:02.824 --> 01:31:06.528 region:rollup2
DOES THE DUSTBIN FUNDED.

01:31:04.192 --> 01:31:08.196 region:rollup2
.

01:31:06.528 --> 01:31:09.531 region:rollup2
FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW AND THERE

01:31:08.196 --> 01:31:12.167 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL PROPOSALS IN THE

01:31:09.531 --> 01:31:13.902 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET.

01:31:12.167 --> 01:31:15.370 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE. OF

01:31:13.902 --> 01:31:16.871 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD JUST YOU KNOW I'M NOT

01:31:15.370 --> 01:31:18.940 region:rollup2
TRYING TO PLAY DEBT FOR DEBT AND

01:31:16.871 --> 01:31:19.674 region:rollup2
WAS DRYING ST WE.

01:31:18.940 --> 01:31:21.109 region:rollup2
AFFIRMATIVE BUT THIS HUNDRED

01:31:19.674 --> 01:31:22.043 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS IN THERE

01:31:21.109 --> 01:31:23.178 region:rollup2

PROBLEM WHAT'S GOING TO BE ON

01:31:24.145 --> 01:31:28.016 region:rollup2
THE WAY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. IS

01:31:25.814 --> 01:31:30.251 region:rollup2
ALL THE PROBLEM THEN BUT DIDN'T

01:31:28.016 --> 01:31:31.086 region:rollup2
WE HAVE ARE POTENTIALLY AN

01:31:30.251 --> 01:31:32.654 region:rollup2

JUST THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDED INTO

01:31:37.592 --> 01:31:39.627 region:rollup2
A COOLEY WINDOWS FOR A LONG TIME

01:31:38.393 --> 01:31:41.763 region:rollup2
SO PLEASE THINK ABOUT IT. WEEK

01:31:39.627 --> 01:31:42.330 region:rollup2

RIGHTS ARE NOT EVERYONE'S GOING

01:31:49.437 --> 01:31:53.975 region:rollup2
TO PARTICIPATES I THINK WHAT THE

01:31:52.307 --> 01:31:55.844 region:rollup2
LA A MATCHING. WHAT SEE THIS

01:31:53.975 --> 01:31:56.711 region:rollup2
WITH EVERY DISTRICT AND?

01:31:55.844 --> 01:31:58.113 region:rollup2
?

01:31:56.711 --> 01:31:59.748 region:rollup2
THAT'S ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS

01:31:58.113 --> 01:32:01.950 region:rollup2
BUT MAYBE I'LL GO BACK TO YOU

01:31:59.748 --> 01:32:03.451 region:rollup2
MISKIN AT AND I I APPRECIATE

01:32:01.950 --> 01:32:04.853 region:rollup2
THAT THOUGHTFULNESS OF WHAT

01:32:03.451 --> 01:32:06.888 region:rollup2
YOU'RE. TALKING ABOUT THIS IS.

01:32:04.853 --> 01:32:09.591 region:rollup2
A LINGERING ISSUE. AND.

01:32:06.888 --> 01:32:11.426 region:rollup2
BUT THE MONEY WE HAVE AVAILABLE

01:32:09.591 --> 01:32:12.627 region:rollup2
IS IS ONE TIME SO YOU'RE YOU'RE

01:32:11.426 --> 01:32:14.262 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS DOING THINGS

01:32:12.627 --> 01:32:15.630 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY AND THEY BEAT

01:32:14.262 --> 01:32:17.465 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIAL PAY AND HOW WE TAKE

01:32:15.630 --> 01:32:19.534 region:rollup2
A LOOK AT.

01:32:17.465 --> 01:32:21.336 region:rollup2
OUT HOW DO YOU DO THAT WITH ONE

01:32:19.534 --> 01:32:22.704 region:rollup2
TIME MONEY IS NEED ONGOING.

01:32:21.336 --> 01:32:24.205 region:rollup2
COMMITMENT AND SO THE GOVERNOR

01:32:22.704 --> 01:32:26.007 region:rollup2
FOR WRONG OR RIGHT BASED UPON

01:32:24.205 --> 01:32:27.575 region:rollup2
THE REVENUE PROJECTIONS THAT

01:32:26.007 --> 01:32:29.878 region:rollup2
THIS IS A PROBLEM WE HAVE. POT

01:32:27.575 --> 01:32:31.312 region:rollup2
OF HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME TO

01:32:29.878 --> 01:32:32.347 region:rollup2
TACKLE IT IN SO.

01:32:31.312 --> 01:32:33.648 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE'RE

01:32:32.347 --> 01:32:35.850 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH BUT THIS WELL.

01:32:33.648 --> 01:32:38.286 region:rollup2
SO.

01:32:35.850 --> 01:32:41.990 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD WE HEAR HEAR THIS.

01:32:38.286 --> 01:32:43.591 region:rollup2
WE HEAR THE KIDDIES ISSUES.

01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:45.126 region:rollup2
OUT HIS MINISTER MURATSUCHI.

01:32:43.591 --> 01:32:47.429 region:rollup2
TOM.

01:32:45.126 --> 01:32:48.730 region:rollup2
I'M MAY NOT BE AWARE OF THE FULL

01:32:47.429 --> 01:32:50.765 region:rollup2
HISTORY OF THE ISSUE OF

01:32:48.730 --> 01:32:52.734 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE DIFFERENTIAL PAY BUT

01:32:50.765 --> 01:32:54.369 region:rollup2
TO. ME THE ALEJO MADE IT CLEAR

01:32:52.734 --> 01:32:55.804 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU'RE HEARING IS.

01:32:54.369 --> 01:32:57.839 region:rollup2
THE COURT NUMBER ONE ISSUE FOR

01:32:55.804 --> 01:32:59.274 region:rollup2
THE SHORTAGE.

01:32:57.839 --> 01:33:02.744 region:rollup2
BOTH FOR SPECIAL LED AN FOR STEM

01:32:59.274 --> 01:33:04.579 region:rollup2
TEACHERS IS PAY. ARE GOOD CAN

01:33:02.744 --> 01:33:07.182 region:rollup2
YOU SUMMARIZE THE.

01:33:04.579 --> 01:33:09.684 region:rollup2
THE ATTEMPTS AND THE.

01:33:07.182 --> 01:33:11.519 region:rollup2
SUCCESS OR FAILURES OF OF PASS

01:33:09.684 --> 01:33:13.488 region:rollup2
ATTEMPTS TO.

01:33:11.519 --> 01:33:15.990 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE MORE PAY FOR.

01:33:13.488 --> 01:33:16.157 region:rollup2
SPECIAL ED AND STEM TEACHERS.

01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:18.793 region:rollup2
AND.

01:33:16.157 --> 01:33:20.295 region:rollup2
.

01:33:18.793 --> 01:33:21.696 region:rollup2
I THINK DISTRICTS TRY IN SOME

01:33:20.295 --> 01:33:23.898 region:rollup2
INSTANCES SO I THINK THAT

01:33:21.696 --> 01:33:26.000 region:rollup2
SOMEONE COMMON FOR DISTRICTS TO

01:33:23.898 --> 01:33:28.436 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE. A A

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:30.238 region:rollup2
SIGNING BONUS OR AND AN ANNUAL

01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:32.607 region:rollup2
STIPEND OF SAY SEVEN HUNDRED

01:33:30.238 --> 01:33:33.908 region:rollup2
DOLLARS WHICH IS A SMALL BOOST.

01:33:32.607 --> 01:33:35.410 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THERE ARE TRYING TO

01:33:33.908 --> 01:33:38.179 region:rollup2
WORK WITH THEIR UNIONS TO FIGURE

01:33:35.410 --> 01:33:39.447 region:rollup2
OUT HOW TO DO SOME COMPENSATION.

01:33:38.179 --> 01:33:41.516 region:rollup2
BUT IT HASN'T BEEN RUNOFF.

01:33:39.447 --> 01:33:43.785 region:rollup2
.

01:33:41.516 --> 01:33:46.488 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THERE'S A CULTURE A

01:33:43.785 --> 01:33:48.456 region:rollup2
BED OF RESISTANCE BECAUSE OF.

01:33:46.488 --> 01:33:49.824 region:rollup2
WANTING TO BE TREATED THE SAME

01:33:48.456 --> 01:33:52.026 region:rollup2
AS YOUR NEIGHBOR WHO WAS IN THE

01:33:49.824 --> 01:33:52.660 region:rollup2
THIRD GRADE CLASSROOM AND YOU'RE

01:33:52.026 --> 01:33:54.295 region:rollup2
RIGHT NEXT DOOR IN THE FOURTH

01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:55.497 region:rollup2
GRADE GRADE CLASSROOM. I THINK

01:33:54.295 --> 01:33:57.465 region:rollup2
SOME OF THAT AGAIN WE CAN

01:33:55.497 --> 01:33:58.867 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE BUT SOME IS THAT THE

01:33:57.465 --> 01:34:00.401 region:rollup2
PERSON IN THE ROOM NEXT YOU

01:33:58.867 --> 01:34:01.903 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE DOING OF FUNDAMENTALLY

01:34:00.401 --> 01:34:03.371 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS FOR A

01:34:01.903 --> 01:34:04.772 region:rollup2
GOOD CHUNK OF THE DAY AND ARE

01:34:03.371 --> 01:34:07.408 region:rollup2
WORKING MORE OVERTIME AND OR

01:34:04.772 --> 01:34:09.043 region:rollup2
HAVING A CASELOAD. THAT EVEN THE

01:34:07.408 --> 01:34:10.545 region:rollup2
TEACHER NEXT DOOR WOULD CONSIDER

01:34:09.043 --> 01:34:11.479 region:rollup2
I DON'T WANT THAT CASE LOAD

01:34:10.545 --> 01:34:13.448 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND WE DON'T HAVE RULES

01:34:11.479 --> 01:34:14.682 region:rollup2
LIKE LET'S JUST SHUFFLE STUDENTS

01:34:13.448 --> 01:34:16.384 region:rollup2
TO READ TEACHERS AROUND SO

01:34:14.682 --> 01:34:16.885 region:rollup2
THOUGH MOVE FROM SPECIAL ED INTO

01:34:16.384 --> 01:34:20.021 region:rollup2
GENERAL AND.

01:34:16.885 --> 01:34:20.555 region:rollup2
SO I THINK IT JUST STONE MAYBE

01:34:20.021 --> 01:34:21.556 region:rollup2
AS.

01:34:20.555 --> 01:34:24.159 region:rollup2
CONTINUING TO HAVE THE

01:34:21.556 --> 01:34:25.960 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION WHAT DO UNIONS FIND

01:34:24.159 --> 01:34:28.096 region:rollup2
REASONABLE WHAT KIND DISTRICTS

01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:29.998 region:rollup2
AND UNIONS IN MORE CREATIVE OR

01:34:28.096 --> 01:34:32.901 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WAYS THINK ABOUT. A

01:34:29.998 --> 01:34:34.235 region:rollup2
LONGER TERM MORE SUBSTANTIAL

01:34:32.901 --> 01:34:36.204 region:rollup2
CHANGES TO HOW THEY.

01:34:34.235 --> 01:34:37.238 region:rollup2
DO THESE NEGOTIATIONS AND I

01:34:36.204 --> 01:34:38.573 region:rollup2
REALIZE WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS

01:34:37.238 --> 01:34:40.608 region:rollup2
MODEST BUT I THINK IT'S AN

01:34:38.573 --> 01:34:42.410 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT SIGNAL RIGHT NOW THE

01:34:40.608 --> 01:34:44.112 region:rollup2
STATE SETS THE DEFAULT. AND I

01:34:42.410 --> 01:34:46.281 region:rollup2
THINK THAT DEFAULT CREATES A

01:34:44.112 --> 01:34:47.815 region:rollup2
CLIMATE AND NOT COULD AGAIN IN A

01:34:46.281 --> 01:34:48.983 region:rollup2
SMALL WAY BE CHANGED AND MAYBE

01:34:47.815 --> 01:34:50.852 region:rollup2
OVER THE COURSE OF A NUMBER OF

01:34:48.983 --> 01:34:52.420 region:rollup2
YEARS DISTRICT CONVERSATIONS BUT

01:34:50.852 --> 01:34:53.755 region:rollup2
START CHANGING I THINK THEIR

01:34:52.420 --> 01:34:54.956 region:rollup2
SONS.

01:34:53.755 --> 01:34:57.392 region:rollup2
PERCOLATING YOU HEAR ABOUT

01:34:54.956 --> 01:34:58.826 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS EVERY SO OFTEN TRYING

01:34:57.392 --> 01:35:00.662 region:rollup2
MORE SUBSTANTIAL THINGS THE

01:34:58.826 --> 01:35:01.663 region:rollup2
STATE IN THE PROCESS TRIED ONE

01:35:00.662 --> 01:35:03.331 region:rollup2
TIME THREE MILLION DOLLAR

01:35:01.663 --> 01:35:04.766 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE COMPENSATION COME TO

01:35:03.331 --> 01:35:05.934 region:rollup2
THE STATE WILL GIVE YOU SOME

01:35:04.766 --> 01:35:07.368 region:rollup2
PLANNING MONEY TO SIT DOWN WITH

01:35:05.934 --> 01:35:08.970 region:rollup2
YOUR. UNION AND TALK ABOUT THESE

01:35:07.368 --> 01:35:10.805 region:rollup2
THINGS WHICH AGAIN SEEMS SO

01:35:08.970 --> 01:35:12.140 region:rollup2
REASONABLE THAT HASN'T WE DON'T

01:35:10.805 --> 01:35:14.008 region:rollup2
WE GOT VIRTUALLY NO TAKERS THE

01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:15.810 region:rollup2
LAST TIME STATE TRIED THIS SO I

01:35:14.008 --> 01:35:17.145 region:rollup2
THINK IT GIVES YOU AN INDICATION

01:35:15.810 --> 01:35:18.846 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE THE CULTURE.

01:35:17.145 --> 01:35:20.148 region:rollup2
AND MAKING IT BUT AGAIN I DON'T

01:35:18.846 --> 01:35:21.382 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S INSURMOUNTABLE I

01:35:20.148 --> 01:35:22.517 region:rollup2
THINK PEOPLE CAN GET ON THE SAME

01:35:21.382 --> 01:35:23.885 region:rollup2
PAGE IN YOUR PRIORITY YOU CAN

01:35:22.517 --> 01:35:24.852 region:rollup2
SING SIGNAL PRIORITIES THAT

01:35:23.885 --> 01:35:26.054 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE VERY SIMILAR TO THE

01:35:24.852 --> 01:35:26.821 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES IN THE FIELD AND IT

01:35:26.054 --> 01:35:28.489 region:rollup2
JUST TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF

01:35:26.821 --> 01:35:31.226 region:rollup2
PERSISTENCE CREATIVITY IT FIGURE

01:35:28.489 --> 01:35:32.126 region:rollup2
OUT. HOW TO DO IT WHEN WAS THE

01:35:31.226 --> 01:35:33.161 region:rollup2
LAST TIME THAT WHICH RIGHTS?

01:35:32.126 --> 01:35:35.129 region:rollup2
I'M AND IT WAS BEFORE THE

01:35:33.161 --> 01:35:36.831 region:rollup2
RECESSION SO I'M I'M GOING TO

01:35:35.129 --> 01:35:37.599 region:rollup2
GET THE YEAR I SUSPECT WRONG BUT

WANTED TO TAKE THIS LATTER

01:54:33.433 --> 01:54:37.270 region:rollup2
APPROACH BE ON A FIVE YEAR PLAN

01:54:35.736 --> 01:54:39.806 region:rollup2
ONE AND A HALF BILLION A YEAR.

01:54:37.270 --> 01:54:41.074 region:rollup2
OPSEU HOW STAFF TO DO IT.

01:54:39.806 --> 01:54:42.976 region:rollup2

POSITIONS NOW.

01:54:42.976 --> 01:54:45.545 region:rollup2
THEY USE SEVEN OF THESE IN THE

01:54:44.378 --> 01:54:46.380 region:rollup2
COURT THEY USE SEVEN OF THESE IN

01:54:45.545 --> 01:54:47.714 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT YEAR TO PROCESS

01:54:46.380 --> 01:54:48.882 region:rollup2

POSITIONS. IN THE BUDGET YEAR.

01:54:51.985 --> 01:54:55.489 region:rollup2
SO THE FORTY TWO OTHER POSITIONS

01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:56.723 region:rollup2
ARE DOING APPEALS WORK SOMEHOW

01:54:55.489 --> 01:54:58.191 region:rollup2
REACH CLOSING OUT SOME AUDIT

01:54:56.723 --> 01:54:59.626 region:rollup2
WORK

01:54:58.191 --> 01:55:01.027 region:rollup2
AS YOU MIGHT RECALL LAST YEAR

01:54:59.626 --> 01:55:02.629 region:rollup2
YOU MADE A DECISION TO TAKE

01:55:01.027 --> 01:55:04.231 region:rollup2
STATE AUDITING OF PROJECTS AND

01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:05.732 region:rollup2
DEVOLVE IT SO THE AUDITING

01:55:04.231 --> 01:55:06.733 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONS NOW AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

01:55:05.732 --> 01:55:10.036 region:rollup2
AND WHEN YOU DID THAT YOU.

01:55:06.733 --> 01:55:12.372 region:rollup2
DIDN'T REDUCE OPSEU STAFF I'M IN

01:55:10.036 --> 01:55:15.041 region:rollup2
A TANDEM ACTION.

01:55:12.372 --> 01:55:16.543 region:rollup2
WHAT WE ALSO KNOW IS THAT THE ON

01:55:15.041 --> 01:55:18.078 region:rollup2
AVERAGE PERSON I'M A FULL TIME

01:55:16.543 --> 01:55:23.116 region:rollup2
PERSON OVER IT OPS THE IS

01:55:18.078 --> 01:55:25.152 region:rollup2
PROCESSING ONE POINT FOUR

01:55:23.116 --> 01:55:26.553 region:rollup2
APPLICATIONS PER MONTH?

01:55:25.152 --> 01:55:27.320 region:rollup2
SO WE SAT DOWN WITH OPSEU TO SAY

01:55:26.553 --> 01:55:28.722 region:rollup2
WHAT'S ENTAILED IN AN

01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:29.389 region:rollup2
APPLICATION REVEAL AND WE THINK

01:55:28.722 --> 01:55:31.057 region:rollup2
THAT COULD RECENTLY DONE BE DONE

01:55:29.389 --> 01:55:32.025 region:rollup2
MORE QUICKLY.

01:55:31.057 --> 01:55:32.826 region:rollup2
SO WE RAN AN ESTIMATE FOR YOU WE

01:55:32.025 --> 01:55:34.728 region:rollup2
SAID WELL WHAT IF THEY WERE TO

01:55:32.826 --> 01:55:36.630 region:rollup2
USE TWELVE PEOPLE ON THE BUDGET

01:55:34.728 --> 01:55:38.131 region:rollup2
YEAR RATHER THAN PAN. AND WHAT

01:55:36.630 --> 01:55:39.633 region:rollup2
IF THEY WERE TO PROCESS TO

01:55:38.131 --> 01:55:40.767 region:rollup2
APPLICATIONS PER MONTH RATHER

01:55:39.633 --> 01:55:42.702 region:rollup2
THAN ONE POINT FOUR SO I WOULD

01:55:40.767 --> 01:55:44.571 region:rollup2
ARGUE A VERY MODEST THAT OF

01:55:42.702 --> 01:55:45.872 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTIONS BUT IF THAT'S ALL

01:55:44.571 --> 01:55:46.706 region:rollup2
YOU ASSUME TWELVE FULL TIME

01:55:45.872 --> 01:55:48.341 region:rollup2
POSITIONS DURING TWO

01:55:46.706 --> 01:55:50.110 region:rollup2
APPLICATIONS A MONTH. THEY WOULD

01:55:48.341 --> 01:55:51.311 region:rollup2
ON AVERAGE PROCESS ONE AND HALF

01:55:50.110 --> 01:55:52.913 region:rollup2
BILLION I MEAN NOT ON AVERAGE

01:55:51.311 --> 01:55:53.980 region:rollup2
BUT THEY WERE PROCESS ONE AND A

01:55:52.913 --> 01:55:55.415 region:rollup2
HALF BILLION NEXT YEAR.

01:55:53.980 --> 01:55:56.483 region:rollup2
SO WE THINK IT'S NOT A STAFFING

01:55:55.415 --> 01:55:57.951 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

01:55:56.483 --> 01:55:59.719 region:rollup2
THAT YOU COULD AGAIN RECENTLY

01:55:57.951 --> 01:56:00.887 region:rollup2

SUBSTANTIALLY MORE IF YOU WANTED

01:56:00.887 --> 01:56:03.657 region:rollup2
TO DO MORE THAN ONE POINTFIVE

01:56:03.023 --> 01:56:11.598 region:rollup2
BUT ONE POINT FIVE WOULD PUT YOU

01:56:03.657 --> 01:56:12.833 region:rollup2
ON THE FIVE YEAR.

AND JUST WANTED TO BREAK DOWN

02:06:06.826 --> 02:06:10.430 region:rollup2

BONDS IN THE NUMBER PROJECTS.

02:08:03.709 --> 02:08:07.480 region:rollup2
IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

02:08:26.065 --> 02:08:29.902 region:rollup2
FACILITIES. THOSE ARE PROCESS AT

02:08:28.267 --> 02:08:31.904 region:rollup2
THOSE APPLICATIONS ARE REVIEWED

THE GOVERNOR GAVE YOU FIVE IN

02:09:20.686 --> 02:09:25.358 region:rollup2
JANUARY LEGISLATURE EXPRESSED

SOME FRUSTRATION GAVE YOU MORE

02:09:25.358 --> 02:09:28.227 region:rollup2
AND THE MAY REVISION AND I THINK

02:09:26.525 --> 02:09:29.695 region:rollup2
THAT LANDED ON SOMETHING LIKE

02:09:28.227 --> 02:09:31.597 region:rollup2
TWELVE SO THOSE TWELVE HAVE

02:09:29.695 --> 02:09:34.100 region:rollup2
MOVED FORWARD. THE GOVERNOR CAME

02:09:31.597 --> 02:09:35.601 region:rollup2

PLANS SO YOU FUNDED THE WORKING

02:09:37.637 --> 02:09:41.007 region:rollup2
DRAWINGS ON THOSE TWELVE TO

02:09:39.305 --> 02:09:43.009 region:rollup2
CONTINUE ADVANCING THROUGH THE

02:09:41.007 --> 02:09:44.410 region:rollup2
PIPELINE AND THEN YOU ADDED.

02:09:43.009 --> 02:09:46.946 region:rollup2

EIGHTEEN NINETEEN.

02:09:48.581 --> 02:09:53.486 region:rollup2

02:09:51.217 --> 02:09:54.987 region:rollup2
MODEST PLAN SO JUST AS HE HAS

02:09:53.486 --> 02:09:56.522 region:rollup2
WHEN I ADMIRE CHARACTERIZE AS A

02:09:54.987 --> 02:09:57.823 region:rollup2
MODEST PLAN ON THE KEY TWELVE

SIX HUNDRED MILLION OF SEVEN

02:09:59.125 --> 02:10:01.894 region:rollup2
BILLION IT'S THE SAME SORT OF

02:10:00.926 --> 02:10:03.362 region:rollup2
MODEST PLAN ON THE COMMUNITY

02:10:01.894 --> 02:10:04.864 region:rollup2
COLLEGES.

02:10:03.362 --> 02:10:06.165 region:rollup2
HE'S ACTUALLY TRICKLING OUT THE

02:10:04.864 --> 02:10:07.967 region:rollup2
MONEY A LITTLE BIT MORE SLOWLY

02:10:06.165 --> 02:10:09.368 region:rollup2
ON THE COLLEGE SIDE BECAUSE HE'S

02:10:07.967 --> 02:10:10.403 region:rollup2
DOING IT IN PHASES WHICH IS WHAT

02:10:09.368 --> 02:10:11.637 region:rollup2

CONSTRUCTION. THEN FONG

02:10:17.209 --> 02:10:20.046 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION ONCE THEY GET THERE

02:10:18.711 --> 02:10:21.580 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE APPROACH THAT

02:10:20.046 --> 02:10:24.083 region:rollup2
FINANCING YOU HAVE BEEN TAKING

02:10:21.580 --> 02:10:24.650 region:rollup2

02:10:36.195 --> 02:10:39.131 region:rollup2
HOW MANY THAT ARE BEING FUNDED

02:10:37.630 --> 02:10:40.900 region:rollup2
YEAH SO HIS ADVANCING ALL THE

02:10:39.131 --> 02:10:42.501 region:rollup2
PROJECTS LAST YEAR AND I I'M

02:10:40.900 --> 02:10:44.003 region:rollup2
FORGETTING BUT HE ADDED AT LEAST

02:10:42.501 --> 02:10:45.571 region:rollup2
FIVE THAT MIGHT OF BEEN MORE

02:10:44.003 --> 02:10:47.239 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR OF? TOTALLY NEW

02:10:45.571 --> 02:10:49.008 region:rollup2
PROJECTS WHERE HE'S FUNDING THE

02:10:47.239 --> 02:10:50.710 region:rollup2
FIRST DAY DEPLOYMENT PLANS TO

02:10:49.008 --> 02:10:52.278 region:rollup2
GET AS TO WHAT NUMBER.

02:10:50.710 --> 02:10:52.778 region:rollup2
I YOU KNOW THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN

02:10:52.278 --> 02:10:54.880 region:rollup2
THIS LOS I WAS A NUMBER

02:10:52.778 --> 02:10:57.249 region:rollup2
PROJECTS.

02:10:54.880 --> 02:10:58.718 region:rollup2
I THINK ONLY BITS.

02:10:57.249 --> 02:11:00.619 region:rollup2
I DO THINK IT'S ONLY LIKE FIVE

02:10:58.718 --> 02:11:02.555 region:rollup2
PROJECTS.

02:11:00.619 --> 02:11:04.056 region:rollup2
GOOD SO FAR A YACHT AND THOSE

02:11:02.555 --> 02:11:05.224 region:rollup2
FIVE PROJECTS BECAUSE IT'S ONLY

02:11:04.056 --> 02:11:07.326 region:rollup2
PRELIMINARY PLANS THAT WOULD BE

02:11:05.224 --> 02:11:08.861 region:rollup2
NEWLY ADDED IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

02:11:07.326 --> 02:11:10.229 region:rollup2
THEY THEY TOTAL LIKE TONS OF

02:11:08.861 --> 02:11:11.797 region:rollup2
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IT'S A LOW

02:11:10.229 --> 02:11:13.766 region:rollup2
PRICE TAG BECAUSE THE PLANNER

02:11:11.797 --> 02:11:14.934 region:rollup2
PLANS IS OBVIOUSLY. A NOT AN

02:11:13.766 --> 02:11:16.402 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE COMPONENT OF THE

02:11:14.934 --> 02:11:18.771 region:rollup2
ENTIRE PROCESS EXTENSIVE

02:11:16.402 --> 02:11:19.638 region:rollup2
COMPONENT ITS CONSTRUCTION AND

02:11:18.771 --> 02:11:22.308 region:rollup2
AND THE BONDS WOULD WOULD.

02:11:19.638 --> 02:11:23.709 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BE THE NEW CONSTRUCTION

02:11:22.308 --> 02:11:25.010 region:rollup2
FOR SAY THAT STAY ON COMMUNITY

02:11:23.709 --> 02:11:27.580 region:rollup2
COLLEGE WOULD HAVE TO BE USED BY

02:11:25.010 --> 02:11:29.582 region:rollup2
WHEN.

02:11:27.580 --> 02:11:31.751 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK THAT THERE IS ANY

02:11:29.582 --> 02:11:33.285 region:rollup2
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS THE STATE

02:11:31.751 --> 02:11:35.154 region:rollup2
CAN BE ON THE FIVE YEAR PLAN THE

02:11:33.285 --> 02:11:37.022 region:rollup2
TWELVE YEAR PLAN THE TWENTY YEAR

02:11:35.154 --> 02:11:38.557 region:rollup2
PLAN. AYE WE DIDN'T EMPHASIZE

02:11:37.022 --> 02:11:40.559 region:rollup2
THAT TODAY BUT THERE ARE STILL

02:11:38.557 --> 02:11:43.462 region:rollup2
SOME BONDS WAY BACK FROM THE FOR

02:11:40.559 --> 02:11:44.797 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND SIX WHERE MONEY AS.

AND IN THESE CASES WHERE MONEY

02:11:44.797 --> 02:11:47.299 region:rollup2
IS VERY OLD MORE THAN TEN YEARS

02:11:46.732 --> 02:11:48.968 region:rollup2
OLD THAT'S BECAUSE IT WAS

02:11:47.299 --> 02:11:50.069 region:rollup2
GRANTED FOR PROJECT THAT

02:11:48.968 --> 02:11:52.505 region:rollup2

THAT KINDA GET EXPIATE IT.

02:12:10.723 --> 02:12:15.261 region:rollup2
CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT

02:12:12.458 --> 02:12:16.896 region:rollup2
NOW IF OTHER PROJECTS ARE IN THE

02:12:15.261 --> 02:12:18.664 region:rollup2
QUEUE IN THE LINE.

02:12:16.896 --> 02:12:20.966 region:rollup2
TO BE FUNDED.

02:12:18.664 --> 02:12:22.234 region:rollup2
AND THE OTHER PROJECTS.

02:12:20.966 --> 02:12:24.937 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE THE.

02:12:22.234 --> 02:12:28.174 region:rollup2
EXPEDIA ADDED SAFETY OUT.

02:12:24.937 --> 02:12:30.075 region:rollup2
I GET FUNDED AHEAD OF THEM.

02:12:28.174 --> 02:12:33.279 region:rollup2
COULD SOME OF THE PROJECTS THAT

02:12:30.075 --> 02:12:34.547 region:rollup2
WERE IN LINE FALAH.

02:12:33.279 --> 02:12:36.515 region:rollup2
NOT WERE NOT GETTING FUNDED NOT

02:12:34.547 --> 02:12:38.417 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY AND RIGHT NOW WE HAVE

02:12:36.515 --> 02:12:40.286 region:rollup2
ENOUGH ON THE THIRTY TWO PROCESS

02:12:38.417 --> 02:12:41.720 region:rollup2
IS HEALTH AND SAFETY PROJECTS.

02:12:40.286 --> 02:12:43.255 region:rollup2
AND EVEN WHEN WE DIDN'T HAVE

02:12:41.720 --> 02:12:44.924 region:rollup2
PROGRAM FUNDS BEFORE PROP FIFTY

02:12:43.255 --> 02:12:46.892 region:rollup2
ONE WAS PASSED.

02:12:44.924 --> 02:12:48.194 region:rollup2
OUT THERE IS RESIDUAL FUNDS EVER

02:12:46.892 --> 02:12:51.096 region:rollup2
COMING BACK IN THE PROGRAM AS A

02:12:48.194 --> 02:12:52.998 region:rollup2
RESULT OF COMPLIANCE REVIEWS

02:12:51.096 --> 02:12:55.034 region:rollup2
RECISIONS AND CLOSEOUTS.

02:12:52.998 --> 02:12:56.468 region:rollup2
I AM SO AND ACTUALLY PAYMENTS AS

02:12:55.034 --> 02:12:57.470 region:rollup2
WELL BECAUSE OF SOME COMPONENTS

02:12:56.468 --> 02:12:59.405 region:rollup2
OF OUR PROGRAM THAT ACTUALLY HAS

02:12:57.470 --> 02:13:00.673 region:rollup2
A REPAYMENT PROCESS.

02:12:59.405 --> 02:13:01.607 region:rollup2
AND SO AS PROGRAM FUNDS ARE

02:13:00.673 --> 02:13:03.742 region:rollup2
COMING IN.

02:13:01.607 --> 02:13:05.044 region:rollup2
WE WERE ABLE TO.

02:13:03.742 --> 02:13:05.978 region:rollup2
STILL PROCESS OF HEALTH AND

02:13:05.044 --> 02:13:07.680 region:rollup2
SAFETY PROJECTS ON A FIRST COME

02:13:05.978 --> 02:13:08.981 region:rollup2
FIRST.

02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:10.382 region:rollup2
ORDER BASIS BUT THEY WERE

02:13:08.981 --> 02:13:11.784 region:rollup2
XCELERATED THAT'S TRUE AND

02:13:10.382 --> 02:13:13.085 region:rollup2
THAT'S A REGULATION THAT THE

02:13:11.784 --> 02:13:15.187 region:rollup2
BOARD HAS ADOPTED.

02:13:13.085 --> 02:13:16.355 region:rollup2
SEVERAL YEARS AGO SO THAT WAS

02:13:15.187 --> 02:13:17.723 region:rollup2
THAT THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY

02:13:16.355 --> 02:13:20.226 region:rollup2
WANT TO APPROACH.

02:13:17.723 --> 02:13:22.862 region:rollup2
PROCESSING ARE PROJECTS.

02:13:20.226 --> 02:13:25.130 region:rollup2
I I I DID HEAR CONCERN FROM A

02:13:22.862 --> 02:13:26.932 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DISTRICT IN MY AREA.

02:13:25.130 --> 02:13:29.068 region:rollup2
THAT HAD BEEN IN LINE.

02:13:26.932 --> 02:13:31.237 region:rollup2
AND AND THEN WAS NOT.

02:13:29.068 --> 02:13:32.738 region:rollup2
THE FEAR WAS THAT THEY WOULDN'T.

02:13:31.237 --> 02:13:34.139 region:rollup2
BE FUNDED BECAUSE OTHER PROJECTS

02:13:32.738 --> 02:13:35.040 region:rollup2
WOULD TAKE

02:13:34.139 --> 02:13:37.042 region:rollup2
THE PRESIDENT'S AND SO THEY

02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:38.410 region:rollup2
WOULD BE. IN LINE ONE YEAR BUT

02:13:37.042 --> 02:13:41.947 region:rollup2
MAY HAVE DROPPED OFF FOR

02:13:38.410 --> 02:13:42.915 region:rollup2
FOLLOWING YEARS.

02:13:41.947 --> 02:13:44.149 region:rollup2
YEAH CURRENTLY WE HAVE

02:13:42.915 --> 02:13:45.251 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT BOND AUTHORITY TO

02:13:47.987 --> 02:13:51.790 region:rollup2
MAYBE AT THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT

02:13:49.989 --> 02:13:52.391 region:rollup2
MAY BE IN THE AUDIENCE THERE AND

02:13:51.790 --> 02:13:53.959 region:rollup2
I'M SURE I'M GONNA BE HEARING

02:13:52.391 --> 02:13:55.628 region:rollup2
FROM THEM. THAT WE HAVE A

THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL

02:16:52.504 --> 02:16:55.240 region:rollup2
OF.

02:16:54.039 --> 02:16:58.043 region:rollup2
TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR

02:16:55.240 --> 02:17:01.613 region:rollup2
AUGMENTATION A UNDERSTATES THE

02:16:58.043 --> 02:17:03.048 region:rollup2
LIKELY COST A PRESSURES IN THIS

02:17:01.613 --> 02:17:05.284 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WE THINK.

02:17:03.048 --> 02:17:06.585 region:rollup2
IT AGAIN IT DEPENDS ON EXACTLY

02:17:05.284 --> 02:17:08.587 region:rollup2
HOW YOU STRUCTURE THE PROGRAM

02:17:06.585 --> 02:17:11.156 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH IT WILL COST.

02:17:08.587 --> 02:17:11.790 region:rollup2
BUT UNDER THE EXISTING RULES FOR

02:17:11.156 --> 02:17:13.559 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM WE EXPRESSED A MATE

02:17:11.790 --> 02:17:15.627 region:rollup2
THEN.

02:17:13.559 --> 02:17:16.695 region:rollup2
I LOVE SOMEWHERE AROUND A FIFTY

02:17:15.627 --> 02:17:17.996 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION

02:17:16.695 --> 02:17:20.232 region:rollup2
WOULD BE REQUIRED TO FULLY FUND

02:17:17.996 --> 02:17:22.701 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM IN THE NEXT YEAR.

02:17:20.232 --> 02:17:24.703 region:rollup2
NOW IN PART THAT'S DUE TO A

02:17:22.701 --> 02:17:27.039 region:rollup2
CHANGE THAT THIS BODY MADE VERY

02:17:24.703 --> 02:17:27.406 region:rollup2
LATE IN THE PROCESS DURING LAST

02:17:27.039 --> 02:17:30.542 region:rollup2
YEAR'S BUDGET.

02:17:27.406 --> 02:17:32.978 region:rollup2
WHERE WE INCREASE THE MAXIMUM

02:17:30.542 --> 02:17:35.214 region:rollup2
AWARD ALLOCATION THAT GRANTEES

02:17:32.978 --> 02:17:37.116 region:rollup2
COULD RECEIVE SO IT USED TO BE

02:17:35.214 --> 02:17:38.917 region:rollup2
THAT UNDER THIS PROGRAM?

02:17:37.116 --> 02:17:41.820 region:rollup2
CHARTER SCHOOLS COULD RECEIVE UP

02:17:38.917 --> 02:17:43.689 region:rollup2
EITHER SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF

02:17:41.820 --> 02:17:44.323 region:rollup2
THEIR LEASE ANOTHER FACILITY

02:17:43.689 --> 02:17:50.829 region:rollup2
COSTS OR A MAXIMUM OF AND FIFTY

02:17:44.323 --> 02:17:53.265 region:rollup2
DOLLARS. PER STUDENT

02:17:50.829 --> 02:17:54.833 region:rollup2
MAXIMUM HAD BEEN SET IN LOSS

02:17:53.265 --> 02:17:55.400 region:rollup2
SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE HAD NOT

02:17:54.833 --> 02:17:58.403 region:rollup2
BEEN UPDATED IT IT INITIALLY

02:17:55.400 --> 02:17:59.638 region:rollup2
PAN.

02:17:58.403 --> 02:18:02.074 region:rollup2
AYE CAP ON REALLY

02:17:59.638 --> 02:18:05.911 region:rollup2
EXTRAORDINARILY EXPENSIVE.

02:18:02.074 --> 02:18:07.279 region:rollup2
PLACEMENTS BUT OVER TIME WITH

02:18:05.911 --> 02:18:08.781 region:rollup2
INFLATION AND GONE TO THE POINT

02:18:07.279 --> 02:18:11.316 region:rollup2
WHERE EVEN CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT

02:18:08.781 --> 02:18:12.618 region:rollup2
HAD BELOW AVERAGE FACILITY COSTS

02:18:11.316 --> 02:18:14.453 region:rollup2
WERE CAPPED AT THAT SEVEN

02:18:12.618 --> 02:18:15.254 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FIFTY LEVEL WERE NOT

02:18:14.453 --> 02:18:16.321 region:rollup2
RECEIVING THE SEVENTY FIVE

02:18:15.254 --> 02:18:18.991 region:rollup2
PERCENT. IN SO THE

02:18:16.321 --> 02:18:20.092 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED AND LAST

02:18:18.991 --> 02:18:21.527 region:rollup2
YEAR'S MAY REVISE AND THE

02:18:20.092 --> 02:18:24.029 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE ENDED UP ADOPTING

02:18:21.527 --> 02:18:26.131 region:rollup2
THIS PROPOSAL. THAT WE

02:18:24.029 --> 02:18:27.699 region:rollup2
RETROACTIVELY ADJUSTED UPWARDS

02:18:26.131 --> 02:18:28.800 region:rollup2
FOR THE COST OF LIVING

02:18:27.699 --> 02:18:31.003 region:rollup2
ADJUSTMENT AND K. TWELVE

02:18:28.800 --> 02:18:33.639 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS AND APPLIED THAT COLA

02:18:31.003 --> 02:18:35.207 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD. THAT INCREASES

02:18:33.639 --> 02:18:38.377 region:rollup2
SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY CAP TO A

02:18:35.207 --> 02:18:40.779 region:rollup2
LITTLE LESS THAN TWELVE HUNDRED

02:18:38.377 --> 02:18:41.413 region:rollup2
DOLLARS PER EIGHTY AIM.

02:18:40.779 --> 02:18:43.015 region:rollup2
AND THAT RESULTED AND A PRETTY

02:18:41.413 --> 02:18:45.083 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE COST

02:18:43.015 --> 02:18:46.652 region:rollup2
OF THIS PROGRAM AND WE THINK

02:18:45.083 --> 02:18:48.187 region:rollup2
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY

02:18:46.652 --> 02:18:48.587 region:rollup2
THIS PROGRAM WILL BE MORE

02:18:48.187 --> 02:18:50.355 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE THAN THE

02:18:48.587 --> 02:18:52.457 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION.

02:18:50.355 --> 02:18:53.892 region:rollup2
UGH PROJECTS GOING FORWARD.

02:18:52.457 --> 02:18:57.396 region:rollup2
HOWEVER EVEN IF.

02:18:53.892 --> 02:19:00.098 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO RESEND

02:18:57.396 --> 02:19:01.900 region:rollup2
THAT MAXIMUM A.

02:19:00.098 --> 02:19:03.602 region:rollup2
THE EGGMAN GRANT AWARD INCREASE

02:19:01.900 --> 02:19:05.837 region:rollup2
THAT AND ADOPTED LAST YEAR GO

02:19:03.602 --> 02:19:07.005 region:rollup2
BACK TO THE HISTORICAL SEVEN

02:19:05.837 --> 02:19:09.074 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS.

02:19:07.005 --> 02:19:10.642 region:rollup2
PER STUDENT CAP WE THINK THIS

02:19:09.074 --> 02:19:11.543 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WOULD STILL REQUIRE AN

02:19:10.642 --> 02:19:12.878 region:rollup2
EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR

02:19:11.543 --> 02:19:15.280 region:rollup2
AUGMENTATION JUST TO FULLY FUND

02:19:12.878 --> 02:19:17.082 region:rollup2
AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN.

02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:18.217 region:rollup2
BUT NOW TO DEAL WITH THE OTHER

02:19:17.082 --> 02:19:20.552 region:rollup2
ASPECTS OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S

02:19:18.217 --> 02:19:21.987 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL THEY MAKE SEVERAL.

02:19:20.552 --> 02:19:23.922 region:rollup2
ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PROGRAM IN

02:19:21.987 --> 02:19:25.123 region:rollup2
PART TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE

02:19:23.922 --> 02:19:27.860 region:rollup2
COST PRESSURES.

02:19:25.123 --> 02:19:29.595 region:rollup2
A AM ONE OF THEIR PROPOSALS WE

02:19:27.860 --> 02:19:31.396 region:rollup2
THINK IS IS REASONABLE AND WE WE

02:19:29.595 --> 02:19:33.565 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND APPROVING IT IT IT

02:19:31.396 --> 02:19:36.635 region:rollup2
WOULD REMOVE THIS LANGUAGE THAT.

02:19:33.565 --> 02:19:38.537 region:rollup2
PROVIDES AN AUTOMATIC BACK FILL

02:19:36.635 --> 02:19:40.405 region:rollup2
FOR PRIOR YEAR AWARD SO. WHAT

02:19:38.537 --> 02:19:42.074 region:rollup2
HAPPENS UNDER CURRENT A LOT

02:19:40.405 --> 02:19:43.475 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW WITH THIS PROGRAM IS

02:19:42.074 --> 02:19:45.544 region:rollup2
THAT WHEN IT'S OVER SUBSCRIBED

02:19:43.475 --> 02:19:46.745 region:rollup2
THE AD AS IS THE CASE AND

02:19:45.544 --> 02:19:49.181 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN?

02:19:46.745 --> 02:19:50.949 region:rollup2
ALL RECIPIENTS RECEIVE A PRO

02:19:49.181 --> 02:19:53.352 region:rollup2
RATED AWARDS OF RIGHT NOW.

02:19:50.949 --> 02:19:55.520 region:rollup2
RECIPIENTS ARE EXPECTED TO

02:19:53.352 --> 02:19:57.522 region:rollup2
RECEIVE ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT OF

02:19:55.520 --> 02:19:59.925 region:rollup2
THEIR ELIGIBLE AWARD AMOUNT.

02:19:57.522 --> 02:20:01.927 region:rollup2
UNDER CURRENT LAW.

02:19:59.925 --> 02:20:03.362 region:rollup2
ANY ALLOCATION THAT WAS GIVEN TO

02:20:01.927 --> 02:20:05.097 region:rollup2
THIS PROGRAM NEXT YEAR WOULD

02:20:03.362 --> 02:20:07.132 region:rollup2
FIRST BE USED

02:20:05.097 --> 02:20:09.201 region:rollup2
TO GET ALL OF THOSE RECIPIENTS

02:20:07.132 --> 02:20:10.569 region:rollup2
UP TO ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SO.

02:20:09.201 --> 02:20:12.070 region:rollup2
SAY IF THERE'S A TWENTY FIVE

02:20:10.569 --> 02:20:13.105 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS SHORTFALL THE

02:20:12.070 --> 02:20:14.473 region:rollup2
FIRST TWENTY FIVE MILLION

02:20:13.105 --> 02:20:16.775 region:rollup2
DOLLARS THAT YOU ALLOCATE TO

02:20:14.473 --> 02:20:18.343 region:rollup2
THIS PROGRAM EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

02:20:16.775 --> 02:20:20.846 region:rollup2
WILL GO TO THAT PROGRAM.

02:20:18.343 --> 02:20:22.848 region:rollup2
THAT LANGUAGE IS UNUSUAL WE

02:20:20.846 --> 02:20:24.349 region:rollup2
DON'T TREAT ANY OTHER K. TWELVE

02:20:22.848 --> 02:20:26.451 region:rollup2
CATEGORICAL PROGRAM IN THIS FAT.

02:20:24.349 --> 02:20:28.921 region:rollup2
FASHION AND IT EXISTS FOR A VERY

02:20:26.451 --> 02:20:30.088 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC HISTORICAL REASON WHICH

02:20:28.921 --> 02:20:31.523 region:rollup2
WAS A TRANSITION THAT THE

02:20:30.088 --> 02:20:33.592 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WENT THROUGH SEVERAL

02:20:31.523 --> 02:20:34.660 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO AND HAS SINCE BEEN.

02:20:33.592 --> 02:20:35.994 region:rollup2
PLEADED WENT WE THINK IT'S OUT

02:20:34.660 --> 02:20:38.730 region:rollup2
OF DATE AND RECOMMEND.

02:20:35.994 --> 02:20:40.766 region:rollup2
APPROVING THE GOVERNOR'S

02:20:38.730 --> 02:20:43.135 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL TO REMOVE IT. ON WE DO

02:20:40.766 --> 02:20:44.269 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT IF THE LEGISLATURE'S

02:20:43.135 --> 02:20:46.071 region:rollup2
CONCERNED.

02:20:44.269 --> 02:20:47.940 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

02:20:46.071 --> 02:20:49.508 region:rollup2
THE PROBATION IN THE CURRENT

02:20:47.940 --> 02:20:50.909 region:rollup2
YEAR AWARD CA CAN FOLLOW THE

02:20:49.508 --> 02:20:52.844 region:rollup2
PRACTICE THAT OCCASIONALLY

02:20:50.909 --> 02:20:53.979 region:rollup2
FOLLOWS WITH OTHER CATEGORICAL

02:20:52.844 --> 02:20:56.648 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS OF PROVIDING A

02:20:53.979 --> 02:20:58.116 region:rollup2
DISCRETIONARY ONE TIME BACKFILL.

02:20:56.648 --> 02:21:01.486 region:rollup2
AND THE OTHER THREE.

02:20:58.116 --> 02:21:04.056 region:rollup2
CHANGES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION.

02:21:01.486 --> 02:21:05.757 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDS MAKING TO THE PROGRAM

02:21:04.056 --> 02:21:06.858 region:rollup2
O. WE IT WE JUST DON'T THINK THE

02:21:05.757 --> 02:21:09.061 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION'S PROVIDED A

02:21:06.858 --> 02:21:11.496 region:rollup2
COMPELLING JUSTIFICATION FOR SO

02:21:09.061 --> 02:21:13.131 region:rollup2
AND THIS INCLUDES. A CAPPING A

02:21:11.496 --> 02:21:15.834 region:rollup2
THE.

02:21:13.131 --> 02:21:18.637 region:rollup2
GROWTH AND REDUCE COSTS THAT CAN

02:21:15.834 --> 02:21:20.772 region:rollup2
BE CLAIMED FOR THE AWARD AT THE

02:21:18.637 --> 02:21:22.007 region:rollup2
K. TWELVE COLA LEVEL. OF WHEN WE

02:21:20.772 --> 02:21:23.909 region:rollup2
THINK THIS IS UNNECESSARY

02:21:22.007 --> 02:21:25.877 region:rollup2
ALREADY APPLICANTS HAVE TO PAY

02:21:23.909 --> 02:21:27.779 region:rollup2
AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF

02:21:25.877 --> 02:21:29.014 region:rollup2
THEIR LEASE COSTS A UNDER THIS

02:21:27.779 --> 02:21:31.016 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WE THINK THAT'S.

02:21:29.014 --> 02:21:33.018 region:rollup2
A POWERFUL INCENTIVE IN MOST

02:21:31.016 --> 02:21:35.120 region:rollup2
CASES TO KEEP THOSE THESE COSTS

02:21:33.018 --> 02:21:37.422 region:rollup2
LOW. THAT BIG CONCERN HERE AS WE

02:21:35.120 --> 02:21:39.124 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND IT IS SPECIFIC TO

02:21:37.422 --> 02:21:41.326 region:rollup2
CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT HAVE. A

02:21:39.124 --> 02:21:44.129 region:rollup2
CONFLICT OF INTEREST WHERE THEIR

02:21:41.326 --> 02:21:45.464 region:rollup2
LANDLORD ALSO SERVES ON THE

02:21:44.129 --> 02:21:46.998 region:rollup2
CHARTER SCHOOLS BOARD MAKE SOME

02:21:45.464 --> 02:21:48.800 region:rollup2
FACILITY DECISIONS IN THOSE

02:21:46.998 --> 02:21:50.836 region:rollup2
CASES PERHAPS THE CHARTER SCHOOL

02:21:48.800 --> 02:21:52.371 region:rollup2
HAS AN INCENTIVE TO OVERSTATE

02:21:50.836 --> 02:21:53.672 region:rollup2
THEIR FACILITY COSTS MUST GET A

02:21:52.371 --> 02:21:55.607 region:rollup2
MORE GENEROUS GRANT FROM THE

02:21:53.672 --> 02:21:57.809 region:rollup2
STATE. OF IT WE THINK THAT THAT

02:21:55.607 --> 02:21:59.978 region:rollup2
CAN BE ADDRESSED JUST BY GIVING

02:21:57.809 --> 02:22:02.280 region:rollup2
THE SCHOOL FINANCE AUTHORITY

02:21:59.978 --> 02:22:04.015 region:rollup2
SOME OF BROADER DISCRETION TO

02:22:02.280 --> 02:22:05.684 region:rollup2
REQUIRE INDEPENDENT LEASE

02:22:04.015 --> 02:22:08.687 region:rollup2
APPRAISALS WHEN THEY CREDIBLY

02:22:05.684 --> 02:22:09.554 region:rollup2
SUSPECT THAT A CONFLICT OF

02:22:08.687 --> 02:22:11.556 region:rollup2
INTEREST EXISTS.

02:22:09.554 --> 02:22:12.324 region:rollup2
THE OTHER. THE PROPOSAL HERE

02:22:11.556 --> 02:22:14.092 region:rollup2
WOULD BE.

02:22:12.324 --> 02:22:16.728 region:rollup2
.

02:22:14.092 --> 02:22:19.097 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF LEASE

02:22:16.728 --> 02:22:20.532 region:rollup2
COSTS IN OTHER FACILITY BECAUSE

02:22:19.097 --> 02:22:22.667 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE PROGRAM AND BE.

02:22:20.532 --> 02:22:25.370 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZING LEASE BECAUSE

02:22:22.667 --> 02:22:27.339 region:rollup2
OVER MAINTENANCE COSTS OF OR

02:22:25.370 --> 02:22:28.907 region:rollup2
BUILDING IMPROVEMENT COSTS IN

02:22:27.339 --> 02:22:30.575 region:rollup2
YEARS IN WHICH THE PROGRAM IS

02:22:28.907 --> 02:22:32.010 region:rollup2
OVERSUBSCRIBED WE WE DO THINK

02:22:30.575 --> 02:22:33.845 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S A LOGIC HERE THAT

02:22:32.010 --> 02:22:35.580 region:rollup2
THE INTENT OF THE PROGRAM WAS

02:22:33.845 --> 02:22:37.849 region:rollup2
PRIMARILY TO HELP. CHARTER

02:22:35.580 --> 02:22:39.684 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS WITH THEIR LEASE COSTS.

02:22:37.849 --> 02:22:41.620 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW ALL SCHOOLS DEAL

02:22:39.684 --> 02:22:42.387 region:rollup2
WITH COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

02:22:41.620 --> 02:22:43.455 region:rollup2
MAINTENANCE AND BUILDING

02:22:42.387 --> 02:22:45.057 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS IN MOST CASES THIS

02:22:43.455 --> 02:22:45.991 region:rollup2
IS.

02:22:45.057 --> 02:22:48.760 region:rollup2
PROVIDED OUT THERE GENERAL

02:22:45.991 --> 02:22:49.561 region:rollup2
PURPOSE FUNDING WE THINK IDEALLY

02:22:48.760 --> 02:22:51.630 region:rollup2
CHARTER SCHOOLS WOULD DO THE

02:22:49.561 --> 02:22:52.731 region:rollup2
SAME. BUT IN PRACTICE WE THINK

02:22:51.630 --> 02:22:54.099 region:rollup2
IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO

02:22:52.731 --> 02:22:56.201 region:rollup2
DISENTANGLE THAT FROM THESE

02:22:54.099 --> 02:22:59.237 region:rollup2
COSTS BECAUSE OFTENTIMES. LEASES

02:22:56.201 --> 02:23:00.338 region:rollup2
AND INCLUDE A LANDLORD PROVIDED

02:22:59.237 --> 02:23:02.007 region:rollup2
MAINTENANCE OR BUILDING

02:23:00.338 --> 02:23:03.075 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS SO AND SO FOR THAT

THE FUNDING.

02:36:23.341 --> 02:36:26.711 region:rollup2

PROJECTS IN THE FISCAL YEAR. AS

02:36:37.321 --> 02:36:41.158 region:rollup2
FAR AS THE COSTS GO WE BELIEVE

02:36:39.257 --> 02:36:43.327 region:rollup2
THAT IT WOULD BE ABOUT A TWENTY

02:36:41.158 --> 02:36:45.263 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE ON DEBT

02:36:43.327 --> 02:36:47.498 region:rollup2

02:36:45.263 --> 02:36:49.400 region:rollup2
MENTIONED MOST OF THE COSTS ARE

02:36:47.498 --> 02:36:51.469 region:rollup2
BOND FUNDS. SO WE THINK THAT THE

02:36:49.400 --> 02:36:53.738 region:rollup2
PRICE IS RELATIVELY SMALL

02:36:51.469 --> 02:36:55.239 region:rollup2
COMPARED TO THE PRICE OF DELAY

02:36:53.738 --> 02:36:56.574 region:rollup2

FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS.

02:48:55.959 --> 02:49:00.130 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WE DO BELIEVE THAT THAT

02:48:57.594 --> 02:49:01.264 region:rollup2

02:49:00.130 --> 02:49:03.633 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF

INVEST IN THAT PROGRAM. BUT IT'S

02:49:21.551 --> 02:49:25.422 region:rollup2
A SYSTEMIC ISSUE AND I THINK.

02:49:23.453 --> 02:49:27.190 region:rollup2
