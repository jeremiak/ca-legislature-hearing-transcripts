LOS ANGELES BALL HEIGHTS FOR LEADERSHIP AND INNOVATION. IN THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AT ASSEMBLY WOMAN EGGMAN. GOOD MORNING AND- I AM SORRY I MISSED PART OF THE PRESENTATION OF MY CONCERT OF MY CONCERN WITH ALL BILL'S GOING FORWARD RIGHT NOW IS- THE ISSUE AROUND IS IT IS IT RELEVANT IN THIS MOMENT- SOME OF THE BEST BILLS WITH PAUL LET GO BILLS THIS YEAR BECAUSE IS IT RELEVANT IN THIS MOMENT. AND SO I GUESS MY CONCERN IS THE MEDICAL BOARD WHO WE ARE CHARGING TO DO THE STUDY IS SAYING THEY DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO THE STUDY. AND WE KNOW THAT EVERYBODY BUDGETS ARE GOING TO BE CUT SO IS THERE A PRESSING ISSUE MATH AND RIGHT NOW TO TELL A BOARD TO DO A STUDY THAT THEY'RE TELLING US THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES NOW TO DO WHEN WE KNOW FUTURE BUDGET CUTS ARE DOING AND WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT. IN THIS MOMENT. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- LET ME ADDRESS THAT SO THIS BILL IS THE THING. COMMITTEE IN PARTICULAR IS LOOKING AT THE POLICY ASPECT OF IT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION APPROPRIATIONS WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY DISCUSS THE FISCAL IMPACT. THAT IT WOULD HAVE- BUT LET ME LET ME SHARE SOME SOME ADDITIONAL- CONCERN- THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP IN MY TIME IN YOUR TIME HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE. EVERY TIME DOCTORS COME AND VISIT. SACRAMENTO THEY TELL IS A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT THINGS THE COST OF THE MEDICAL EDUCATION IS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE IN CALIFORNIA. THE BURDEN OF STUDENT LOANS IS EVEN HIGHER- IT IS HARD TO PRACTICE AND BE A DOCTOR IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF THE COST. MANY OF OUR STUDENTS ARE ACTUALLY LEAVING THE STATE. IF YOU ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO BE BILINGUAL REGARDLESS OF WHAT IS IN THE CITY YOU ARE- YOU KNOW THAT THE DEMAND FOR SPANISH. LANGUAGE MEDICAL CARE IS THAT THE HIGHEST- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LATINOS ARE ACTUALLY THE HIGHEST POPULATION. ACROSS OUR STATE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES LIKE YOURS ASSEMBLYMEMBER EGGMAN YOU KNOW FIRST HAND. THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR RULE ACCESS- LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COMPANIES. THIS BILL HELPS TO ESTABLISH A STUDY THAT ALLOWS FOR US TO STATE AFTER TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WE HAVE THE FOUNDATION NECESSARY THE STUDY NECESSARY TO MOVE FORWARD AND ALLOW INTERNATIONAL. MEDICAL GRADUATES TO BE ABLE TO PRACTICE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN A WAY THAT. HELPS ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES. AND HELP CHIEF MEDICAL PARITY THAT INCLUDES CULTURAL AND LANGUAGE COMPETENCY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA. I'LL BE BRIEF MISTER CHAIR JUST AS THIS IS OUR FIRST BILL BUT DID WANT TO SAY ONE OF THE THINGS DURING COPA NINETEEN WE WILL FIND IS THERE ARE DISPARITIES AMONGST. CERTAIN RACES AND AS WE LOOK AT THOSE DISPARITIES ONE OF THE BEST WAYS WE CAN HELP TO- ALLEVIATE THAT IS TO HAVE CULTURALLY COMPETENT AND POLITICALLY COMPETENT PROVIDERS SO MY QUESTION TO YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS DO YOU THINK THIS BILL HELPS US TO HAVE MORE CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY COMPETENT. PROVIDERS SO THAT WE CAN START TO ADDRESS WHAT HAS BEEN A SYSTEMIC ISSUE WITH DISPARITIES IN HEALTH CARE IN OUR STATE OF CALIFORNIA. REMEMBER YEAH ABSOLUTELY I THINK THIS BILL SET THE FOUNDATION OF WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW. THIS IS ESTABLISHING THE FACTS FOR US TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH LEGISLATION IN THE FUTURE THAT ACTUALLY ALLOWS. FOR INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL GRADUATES TO PRACTICE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO RUN THE BILL NOW THAT SAYS WE NEED THIS WE NEED THIS RIGHT NOW BUT WHAT ARE WE GONNA COME ACROSS WE DON'T HAVE THE FACTS WE DON'T HAVE THE STUDY WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING ABOUT IT. SO LET'S LET'S DO IT LET'S SET UP WHAT WE NEED TO SET UP TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS CULTURAL LANGUAGE COMPETENCY AND MEDICAL CARE AND ACCESS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE WE ALLOW. DOCTORS TO BE ABLE TO PRACTICE IN OUR STATE AND WITH THAT RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AND I. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL TAKE THATAS A CLOSE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME. I SEE NONE AND CONSISTENT WITH THE CONVERSATION THAT YOU AND I BOTH HAD ABOUT THE INTENT IN TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN BUILD OFF OF THIS.

THIS WAS CHIU WHENEVER YOU'RE READY RIGHT. WELL GOOD MORNING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS FIRST I WANT TO- THINK THE CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING ON THIS BILL WOULD WITH US AB THIRTY TO THIRTY FIVE FLOW IMPROVED TO TRANSPARENCY. FULL CONSUMERS BY REQUIRING THAT THOSE WHO AVERAGE HEIGHT HE'S SHORT TERM LODGING OR RENTAL TO INCLUDE ALL OF THEIR FEES AND THEY ARE ADVERTISED RATE UP FRONT. CALIFORNIA LAW MAKES IT ILLEGAL FOR ANY BUSINESS TO BE UNTRUE. DECEPTIVE OR MISLEADING THING ADVERTISEMENT FOR GOOD OR SERVICE. AB THIRTY TO THIRTY FIVE IS NOTHING BUT A BUYER BE AWARE LAW TO CLARIFY- THAT THE EXISTING LAW. THE INTENT IS TO REDUCE THE UNPLEASANT SURPRISES FOR THE CUSTOMERS OF CONSUMERS. AND TO REDUCE THE- UNNECESSARY LOSS WHO ALSO TO REDUCE THE TIME THAT WE SPEND ON BOOKING IN THE ROOF THE HOTEL ROOM THIS IS I KNOW THIS IS NOT. IT AND BY ANY MEANS TO REDUCE DEFEAT THEY'RE AT THE DATA ON THE CHARGE TO THE CUSTOMER. I KNOW THAT DOING THIS A PANDEMIC IS HAS TO HOTEL THE SERVICE INDUSTRY REALLY REALLY BAD AND I WILL ACTUALLY WILL BE SUPPORTING A DISASTER RELIEF SURCHARGE FOR THEM IF IT DOESN'T TAKE FROM FOUR YEAR TO IMPLEMENT THAT. THEN THIS BILL IS ALSO A FEAR OF PRACTICE BILLS BECAUSE SOME OFTEN DO THEY DO- ADVERTISED THEIR THEIR DEAR RATE UP FRONT. AND SO TO MAKE IT INTO- COULD BE MORE FAIR TO THOSE WHO ALREADY HAVE A FOLLOWING THE LAW DO WHAT I'M DOING THAT. AND JUST BILL WILL PROVIDE A FEAR OF COMPETITION. THIS IS BILL. DEFINITELY WILL NOT INFLUENCE WHATEVER THE AG AND HOW THEY INTERPRETED THE CURRENT LAW. SO WITH ME HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS ROBERT CARO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. OF THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA WHO'S ALSO THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE- YOUR WITNESS IN SUPPORT IS HERE IN THE GYM IS THAT CORRECT IN PERSON RIGHT. IS THAT AFRICA IS THE IS THE PERSON IN PERSON HERE. ARE ACCORDING TO THE NOTES OR IS THIS GOING TO BE ON CALL I'M SORRY IF THE WITH THEIR WITNESS IN SUPPORT IS THAT INDIVIDUAL HERE IN THE CHAMBERS PHYSICALLY. ACCORDING TO THE NOTES I HAVE IT IT'S IN PERSON OR IS IT THE GENTLEMAN WILL BE CALLING IN SUPPORT. OF HER QUESTION I DON'T KNOW WHERE ARE YOU ROBERT. WE CAN- THEN THE I'M ON THE PHONE OKAY. AS OLD LAN- FOR OUR FOR THIS PURPOSE AGAIN AT TWO MINUTES- UP TO TWO MINUTES FOR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS ROBERT CORRAL EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CONSUMER FEDERATION CALIFORNIA WITH THE SPONSORS OF AB THIRTY TO THIRTY FIVE. I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS ISSUE AND COMMITTEE STAFF AND THE CHAIRMAN FOR A THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF THE BILL. AB THREE TO THIRTY FIVE IS BASED ON THE SIMPLE IDEA THAT CONSUMERS DESERVE TO TRANSPARENT WE KNOW THE FOR TRUE PRICE OF THEIR LODGING OPTIONS BEFORE MAKING A PURCHASE THE DECISION. CHARGING MANDATORY FUSE BUT NOT INCLUDING THEM IN THE ADVERTISE ROOM CRISIS IS KNOWN AS TRIP PRICING AND IT IS DECEPTIVE. THE MOST COMMON OF THESE FEES ARE KNOWN AS RESORT FEES BUT THEY GO BY MANY OTHER NAMES INCLUDING URBAN DESTINATION FEES DALY MANDATORY CHARGES. SOME CLEAN FUELS ALSO UPON THIS CATEGORY BUT NO MATTER WHAT THEY'RE CALLED THE CREATE THE FALSE IMPRESSION THAT A ROOM COST LESS THAN IT ACTUALLY DOES. IT'S THE HOTEL INDUSTRY VERSION OF SURPRISE BILLING AND IT MAKES THEM THREE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. WE WORK IN GOOD FAITH WITH ALL INTERESTED PARTIES AS A RESULT THE BILL WAS AMENDED TO REFLECT CHANGES SUGGESTED BY THE HG AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AS WELL WITH THE WAY IT'S IMPLEMENTATION UNTIL JULY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. YOU TO COVER NINETEEN. PEOPLE TO THE BILL WILL ACTIVELY SUGGEST THAT THE BILL HAS SUDDENLY BECOME RETROACTIVE BECAUSE WE ARE CLARIFYING THE LAW. HOWEVER THE BILL ACTUALLY HELPS THE LODGING INDUSTRY IN THE LONG RUN BECAUSE THAT LAYS OUT HOW ROOM PRICES SHOULD BE ADVERTISED. THE EASIEST WAY TO AVOID ANY CONSUMER CONFUSION THE CLEARLY ADVERTISED THE ACTUALPRICE OF THE ROOM FROM THE BEGINNING NOT THE END OF A MULTI STEP. PROCESS ALLOW ME TO CLOSE BY QUOTING REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN JEFF FORTENBERRY UP THE BRASS GOT A CO  HOR LEGISLATION TO AND- PRICING HE SAYS QUOTE WHEN TRAVELERS SEARCH FOR HOTEL OPTIONS THEY DESERVE TO SEE STRAIGHT FOR CRISIS. THEY SHOULD NOT GET HIT WITH HIDDEN FEES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO CONFUSE CONSUMERS ON THE START THE ACTUAL PRICE ON QUOTE. I COULDN'T AGREE MORE THE CONSUMER FEDERATION CALIFORNIA PURCHASE YOUR SUPPORT OF AB. THIRTY TO THIRTY FIVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I HAVE NO OTHER TO WIND. LOW IN SUPPORT BUT MAY MODERATOR THERE ANY ADDITIONAL CALLERS WISHING TO VOICE THEIR SUPPORT. OF AGAIN NAME AND AFFILIATION IF YOU WISH TO DO SO FOR MEMBERS WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. IN USING YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD YOU MAY PRESS ONE THAN ZERO. WE HAVE A FEW LINES IN Q. WILL GO FIRST ONLINE SIX FIVE SIXTY FIVE NUCLEAR AND.

MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JOHN CALDWELL ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA HOTEL AND LODGING ASSOCIATION HERE'S HOW THE DISCLOSURE OF THESE FEES WORKS TODAY OR THEY DID PRIOR TO THESE RESORTS ALL BEING SHUT DOWN. WHEN YOU ENTER THE DATE OF YOUR STAY AND THE TYPE OF ROOM SUITE DOUBLE BEDS KING QUEEN YOU'LL GET THE ACTUAL PRICE OF THE STATE. THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL WHAT THE SYSTEM CHANGE TO MAKE IT MORE CONVENIENT. THEY WANT THE FULL PRICE INCLUDED BEFORE YOU CHOOSE THE ROOM TYPE. NOW THIS WILL REQUIRE COSTLY PROGRAMMING CHANGE FOR MOST RESERVATION SYSTEMS MORE THAN ELEVEN HUNDRED HOTELS IN THIS STATE HAVE CLOSED SINCE THIS BILL WAS INTRODUCED IN VIRTUALLY ALL THE HOTELS WHO CHARGE THESE FEES ARE CLOSED. WE SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY FOR SUCH A CHANGE THE COMMITTEE RECOGNIZED THE PROBLEM AND PUSHED BOTH OF US FOR A COMPROMISE THE NEW REQUIREMENTS WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FOUR BOTH SIDES AGREED OF COMMITTEES COMPROMISE BUT- AT THE LAST MINUTE THE SPONSOR THROUGH AN AMENDMENT. UNSEEN BY THE CALIFORNIA HOTEL LODGING ASSOCIATION OR THE COMMITTEE. THAT SAID THE NEW REQUIREMENTS ARE QUOTE INTENDED TO CLARIFY EXISTING LAW. AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THERE ARE NUMBER OF LAWSUITS CURRENTLY REGARDING THESE FEES. THE LAWYERS REPRESENTING THE HOTELS IN THE SUITS TOOK ONE LOOK AT THAT LANGUAGE AND CONCLUDED. THE CLARA THAT THE SO CALLED CLARIFICATION LANGUAGE WILL NOT WILL NO DOUBT. BE USED AGAINST THE PARTIES IN THE PENDING LITIGATION AND THEN FUTURE LITIGATION THAT MAY BE PROMPTED BY THIS LANGUAGE. THIS PROVISION MAY THEREFORE AFFECTED WE MAKE THE STATUTE RETROACTIVE. SO WHILE WE AGREED IN GOOD FAITH THAT THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS WON'T TAKE EFFECT UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FOUR OUR LAWYERS ARE TELLING US THAT BECAUSE OF THIS LAST MINUTE QUOTE CLARIFICATION. THE NEW RESERVATION SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS WILL BE APPLIED RETROACTIVELY. AND THE FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE RETROACTIVE RULES WE'LL BE USED AGAINST THE INDUSTRY IN THE CURRENT LITIGATION. AGAIN IF THE QUOTE CLARIFICATION IS REMOVED WE WILL SUPPORT THE DEAL BROKERED BY THIS COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MET MISTER MODERATOR ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION THIS IS THE PORTION OF THE MEETING TO WHICH MEMBERS CAN SPEAK IN OPPOSITION NAME AN AFFILIATION ONLY IF YOU WISH TO DO SO.

CAN YOU HEAR ME OK YES. I UP MY NAME IS ANTHONY LIEU IOWA DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS NO OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE BILL. BUT WE'RE NEITHER AT THE PORT NOR OPPOSE. HOWEVER I'M HERE TODAY AT THE INVITATION OF THE AUTHOR NOT THAT THE ANSWER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS- AND BASICALLY AND THE ISSUE CLARIFICATION AND LIKE THAT THANK LAW. AND PLEASE NOTE THAT TERRY DI OKAY POLICY I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COMMENT. ON ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE APPLICATION OR ENFORCEMENT ACTION THE LEDGER OPTION. MAY OR MAY NOT BE INVOLVED. I NOR CAN I COMMENT ON ANY PENDING LITIGATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NO LONGER A MEMBER OF BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WILL BEGIN WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER OVERALL THE FALL BY ASSEMBLY ONE EGGMAN. OUR OUR STAFF. BUT FIRST YEAH THERE WE GO- ASSEMBLYMAN AYE AYE MY CAUCUS AS A- I'LL TAKE HIS OFFICE YOU CAN HEAR ME- I SEE MY CAUCUS HAS IT OPPOSE RECOMMENDATION ON THIS BILL- I ACTUALLY DISAGREE I THINK THIS IS A GOOD BILL I THINK THIS IS NEEDED CONSUMER PROTECTION. THAT YOU'RE ACTING AND I COMPLIMENT YOU FOR BRINGING FORWARD I HAD A QUESTION THOUGH ABOUT THE EXCLUSION OF STATE AND LOCAL TAXES FROM THE BILL BECAUSE IF THE GOAL OF THE BILL. IS SO A CONSUMER CAN WHEN I GET A PRICE FOR A HOTEL ROOM IN REAL AT THAT SURPRISE THEY'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO PAY WHEN THEY SHOW UP WHY WOULD WE NOT INCLUDE STATE AND LOCAL TAXES AND THAT I'M THINKING ABOUT A SITUATION WHERE. A CONSUMER IS BOOKED IS COMPARISON SHOPPING BETWEEN TWO HOTELS THAT ARE CLOSE TOGETHER BUT UNBEKNOWNST TO THE CONSUMER WAS ONE IS RIGHT ACROSS THE CITY LINE IS TECHNICALLY A DIFFERENT CITY WITH A VERY DIFFERENT- OCCUPANCY TAX RATE SO ONE ACTIVITIES TAX MIGHT BE TWICE AS MUCH AS THE OTHER I THINK THAT THAT'S INFORMATION THE CONSUMER SHOULD GET. I THINK THE PRICE THAT THE CONSUMER SIEGE SHOULD BE THE PRICE THAT THEY PAY WHEN- THEY BUT WHEN THEY STAY AT THE HOTEL I WONDER WHY IT WITH THE LOGIC WAS. NOW IN EXCLUDING THOSE. AS A KIND OF A OVER. OF MY PART. I SAW THAT YOU HE- THE SO TAX. IS NON TO. ALMOST A OR OTHER CUT A CONSUMERS. SO I'VE ALL BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU TO INCLUDE. YOU KNOW ANY LOCAL. TAXES SO WE HAVE A VERY- THE CLEAR PRECISE THE. THE FIGURE ONE DO BUT THE REAL. WELL I'M DON'T KNOW WHAT THE COMPLEXITIES THAT MIGHT ADD TO THE BILL I APPRECIATE YOU TAKE A LOOK AT IT- ONE WAY OR THE OTHER YOU CERTAINLY HAVE MY SUPPORT. DEFINITELY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY WOMAN AND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR JEWETT YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AYE I HAD THIS BILL I HAD A BILL LIKE THIS I HAD A AND I ATE WAS A CONSTITUENT WHO REACHED OUT TO ME HE SAID THIS IS. I WON'T I WON'T USE THE WORD THE CONSTITUENT USE BUT THAT THESE THESE HIDDEN FEES ARE THERE- AND I AGREED AND WE WENT DOWN THIS PATH AND WE WORKED ON IT BUT AGAIN WHEN KOBE CRISIS CAME AROUND WE I DIDN'T THINK THAT THERE WAS A COMPELLING REASON. TO DO THIS AT THIS TIME I ALSO UNDERSTAND WHY YOU HAVE THE RETROACTIVITY ON THERE IT'S BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE AG NEEDS THAT IN ORDER FOR AS THINGS GO FORWARD RIGHT NOW SO. I THINK THE RESORT FEE POLICY IS A BAD POLICY I LOOK FORWARD TO VOTING FOR A BILL IN THE FUTURE THAT WE ADDRESS THE RESORT FEES THE DURING THIS COVER CRISIS AGAIN AS WOULD NEXT WEEK WE'RE ALL GOING TO SIT HERE AND HEAR ABOUT A FIFTY FOUR. BILLION DOLLAR HOLE POTENTIALLY IN OUR BUDGET AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO GO FORWARD I IN GOOD CONSCIOUS AS A AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL DON'T FEEL LIKE I CAN PERSONALLY BOTH FOR BILLS I DON'T THINK ARE RELEVANT IN THIS TIME SO I THINK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION- AND I GUESS I'D JUST OBSERVE THAT AS WE GO FORWARD ANY OTHER BILL YOU DON'T SEE ME VOTING ON I DON'T SEE THE CONNECTION. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THIS BILL HAD NO PHYSICAL IMPACT AND PEOPLE DOES THE WEEKLY STILL TRAVELED DURING THIS THAT THEY'RE DOING THE NEW NORMAL SO. TO BE ABLE TO. OF A CHARACTER. SO AND MAY A- MORE TO. OF THE EXES. LAW I THINK THAT IT IS THIS APPROPRIATE AND WERE. IT THAT AGAIN. IT IS THE EXISTING LAW. WELL I'M NEXT DOUBLE GO TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUNNINGHAM FOLLOWED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I CAN'T TALK IN THESE MASS SO. AND FOR THE RECORD TEN FEET AWAY AT LEAST FROM PHIL CHANCE I THINK WE'RE OKAY- I JUST HAD A QUESTION ABOUT THE BILL'S APPLICATION TO. SEE THOSE SORT OF NORMAL FOLKS THAT MAY HAVE A PLACE THAT THEY WANT TO RUN OUT ON A SHORT TERM BASIS WHETHER SIR HAUSSER VACATION HOME OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT- THE DON'T GO THROUGH AIRBNB OR SOME OF THESE OTHER ONLINE PLATFORMS- SO MY QUESTION IS TWO FOLD ONE WOULD IT WOULD IT APPLY TO THOSE PEOPLE. AND TWO IF SO. HOW ARE THEY GOING TO KNOW WHAT EXACTLY THEY NEED TO LIST- THE AWARE THAT INFORMATION GOING TO BE- COMMUNICATED TO THEM HOW DO THEY FIND THAT OUT AND ARE THEY AT RISK OF LIABILITY FOR LAWSUIT OR ATTORNEY GENERAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION IF THEY AREN'T ABLE TO. TO DO IT RIGHT SO I MEAN THAT THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS AYE AYE I. I APPRECIATE AND I SUPPORT THE DISCLOSURE ASPECT OF THIS- BUT I AM CONCERNED BECAUSE IN MY DISTRICT WE HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS THAT YOU KNOW RUN OUT THEIR HOUSE FOR A COUPLE WEEKS IN THE SUMMER AND I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW THEY'RE GOING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION YES WE THE COVERED THE- IF THERE BE. A B. AND B. AND- REGARDING TO HOW THE FINAL THE VIAL. THE CHARGES AND BUT I THINK. THE ONE THEY'RE GETTING INTO THE BUSINESS. OF IS REALLY UPON DONE TO FIND NOW. SO WHAT ARE TO. THAT THE CHARGES THAT THAT THEY NEED TO PAY. TO THE THIRD PARTY OR WHATEVER. SO YOU'RE- A IF THEY DON'T. KNOW THE CHARGES. AND I THIS IS NOT TO BE APPEARED OF THE LAW AND I GET TO OPEN UP THE DOOR TO CALL US TO INFORM THE TO EDUCATE THEM. OF ALL THEIR CHARGES BUT USUALLY THEY KNOW- WHAT DID THEY NEED TO CHARGE THE TO THEIR CUT A CONSUMERS AND OTHER CUSTOMERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA. BEING SOMEONE WHO TRAVELS QUITE A BIT. OF I UNDERSTAND THE LOGIC AND AM SOMEWHAT SYMPATHETIC- BUT LIKE WE'VE HEARD. FROM OTHER COLLEAGUES. I BELIEVE THAT THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY AT THIS TIME HAS BEEN HARD HIT ENOUGH AND THAT THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO IMPOSE EVEN MORE A REGULATIONS ON THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY SO WITH THAT I WILL LAY OFF AT THIS TIME. WE GIVE THEM FOR YEARS SO THIS ONE WILL NOT BE OF IN THE IMPACT OF. UNTIL TWENTY FOURTEEN AND THAT'S WHY WE THIRTY EIGHT MM AND TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT DESERVE THIS IS EXISTING MALL NOT TO- TO DECEIVE. THE THEIR CUSTOMERS SO IT THERE'S A FOR YEARS TO. IMPLEMENT AT AT- LIKE AS A SAID A GROUP OF FOUR- I WILL EVEN SUPPORT- THE DISASTER RELIEF SURCHARGE AND I DON'T THINK IT WOULD TAKE THEM FOR YEARS. TO IMPLEMENT TO ADD THAT SURCHARGE TO THEIR BILL. SO YOU KNOW I'M I'M SPEAKING IT OF WHAT WAS MY OF PROGRAMMERS HAD ON THE- BUT WITH THE BILL DOES GET TO PROVIDE FOR YEARS FOR YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHRIS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- I THINK THE DISCLOSURE PART OF THIS BILL IS INCREDIBLY NOBLE I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. I WANT TO ASK ABOUT- THE CLARIFICATION LANGUAGE THAT WAS ADDED TO THE BILL AT THE LAST MINUTE- WHAT IMPACT DOES THAT HAVE OR WOULD THAT HAVE. ON THE CURRENT SITUATION WITH THE GLACIATIONS WITH AG AND THE FTC. SO JUST PRETTY MUCH REMINDER YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF THE LONG- IMPLEMENTATION IT'LL FOR YEARS- WALLET JUST TO REMINDER THAT THERE IS AN EXISTING LAW. YOU KNOW AND THIS BILL WILL NOT- TRYING TO INFLUENCE. THE AG'S THE HOLDING INTERPRETED THE EXISTING LAW BUT JUST BECAUSE ALL THAT. IMPLEMENTATION TIME. I FELT IF I MAY TO THE CHAIR SURE I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO HEAR FROM- THE AG'S REPRESENTATIVE AS WELL AS OPPOSITION ON WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN. WHAT THEY BELIEVE THE IMPACT WOULD BE AS WELL SURE SO CAN CHOOSE WHAT TO ORDER THAT IS THANK YOU VERY MUCH RESTORATION LET US THEN JUST GO TO THAT TECHNICAL QUESTION THEN. AGAIN FROM THE REPRESETATIVE ON THE LINE FOR A FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S pOFFICE AND PERHAPS MR GREY HE MIGHT JUST BE ABLE TO REPEAT. THAT QUICK CLARIFICATION SURE AS WELL. SURE SO. THE CLARIFICATION LANGUAGE AND RETROACTIVITY. HOW WITH THIS BILL IMPACT- OF THE CURRENT SITUATION WITH THE GO SHE SHINS BETWEEN AG OFFICES. AND THE FTC WITH THE CAR. FOR RETROACTIVE RETROACTIVE IN INDUSTRIAL THERE'S A CURRENT LAW AND FROM THE BOOK OKAY GREAT SO WE'LL GO TEND TO MODERATE FALL- BY MR CALL THE BUT- MISTER MODERATOR IF AND- I UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE MISTER ANTHONY LOU ON THE LINE FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO ANSWER ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON. TECHNICAL QUESTION. THANK YOU HI THANKS FOR THE QUESTION- SHALL WITH THE IMPACT THAN. CURRENT NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE AG AND ATHLETES BEING- THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN REALLY DISCUSS- BUT NOT WILLING. AGAIN SOMETHING I CAN COMMENT ON- I CAN PROVIDE TACKLE AT THE FENCE ON THE AMENDMENT TO THE BILL BUT I CAN'T REALLY. ABOUT THAT TIME- SOMEONE GRAYSON DID NOT YOU HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL FALL THE QUESTIONS FOR THE REPRESENTATIVE AT THIS POINT NOT THAT. I'M NOT FROM THE REPRESENTATIVE OF FROM OPPOSITION YES THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISS NOT RUNNER DEMO THEN GO TO MR CALL WELL AGAIN. WHEN WE SAW THIS LANGUAGE WE GAVE IT TO THE ATTORNEYS WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THESE CASES AND THEY WROTE TO ME ON MONDAY. THE QUOTE CLARIFICATION LANGUAGE WILL NO DOUBT. NO DOUBT BE USED AGAINST THE PARTIES IN THE PENDING LITIGATION. AND FUTURE LITIGATION THAT MAY BE PROMPTED BY THIS LANGUAGE THE PROVISION MAY THEREFORE EFFECTIVELY MAKE THE STATUTE RETROACTIVE AND IT HAS TO THE RETROACTIVITY I AM NOT AN ATTORNEY. I'M JUST PLAIN READING OF LANGUAGE. YOU CAN YOU SET UP A REQUIREMENT FOR CHANGING ALL THE RESERVATION SYSTEMS AND THEN YOU SAY THIS IS INTENDED TO CLARIFY EXISTING LAW. I'M SORRY JUST REASONABLE A REASONABLE READ IS OKAY. ALL THIS STUFF SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN PLACE FOR YEARS. SO WE DID THIS IN TEND TO YOU KNOW INTENDED TO CLARIFY EXISTING LAW.

GEN THIS FILE ITEM NUMBER TWELVE AB THIRTY THREE THIRTY PLEASE FEEL FREE 2% WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. BUT GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO. PRESENT AT THIRTY THREE THIRTY. WHICH WILL GIVE LOCAL OFFICIALS THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO PREVENT ILLEGAL CANNABIS SALES. THROUGH ONLINE DIRECTORIES. EVER SINCE THE PASSAGE OF PROPOSITION TWO FIFTEEN AND SIXTY FOUR CALIFORNIA HAS WRESTLE WITH HOW TO BEST REGULATE ITS LEGAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY. THROUGH SEVERAL PIECES OF LANDMARK LEGISLATION THE LEGISLATURE CREATED THEM THE MEDICINE ALL AN ADULT USE CANNABIS REGULATION AND SAFETY ACT. THIS ACT WAS BUILT ON THREE KEY PRINCIPLES PROMOTING ILLEGAL CANNABIS. NINE CAN PROMOTE ILLEGAL CANNABIS CELLS TO WORK WITH REGULATORS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT PROTECTING CONSUMERS SOME OF WHOM NEED CANNABIS TO TREAT SEVERE MEDICAL CONDITIONS AND ENSURING LOCAL INTRO OVER CAN'T I WERE HEALTH CANNABIS IS GROWN AND SOLD IN A GIVEN COMMUNITY. AS IS BURGEONING INDUSTRY HAS CONTINUED TO EVOLVE A NEW BUSINESS MODELS HAVE PRESENTED NEW CHALLENGES TO UPHOLDING THESE PRINCIPLES. IN RECENT YEARS CANNABIS RETAILERS BEGAN USING ONLINE ADVERTISING AND HOSTING PLATFORMS TO REMOTE THEIR BUSINESSES AND FIND NEW CUSTOMERS. WELL THIS IS PROVIDED MORE OPTIONS FOR CONSUMERS IT IS ALSO PROVIDED UNLICENSED CANNABIS SELLERS WITH A NEW OPPORTUNITY TO BYPASS STATE AND LOCAL CANNABIS REGULATIONS. BY CONNECTING THROUGH THESE ONLINE PLATFORMS ILLEGAL OPERATIONS CAN DELIVER CANNABIS ACROSS CITY AND COUNTY LINES WITHOUT A LICENSE WELL THE STORE FOR. IT WITHOUT FOLLOWING ANY OTHER REQUIRED SAFETY PROCEDURES INCLUDING EXTENSIVE TESTING OF THE CAMPUS. BY AVOIDING THESE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BITING THE LAW THESE ILLICIT SELLERS HAVE GAINED AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE OVER LICENSE OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION THERE TRANSIENT NATURE MAKES INVESTIGATIONS LONG AND COSTLY AFFAIRS ACROSS MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS THAT RARELY HAVE A LASTING IMPACT EVEN IF THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL. TO CURTAIL THESE UNLICENSED SELLERS WE MUST CUT THEM OFF FROM THE THING ALLOWING THEM TO SELL THEIR ILLICIT GOODS. THEIR ONLINE ADVERTISING. AB THIRTY THREE DOES THIS BY MAKING A PUBLIC NUISANCE. TO COLLECT A FEE TO ADVERTISE OR PROMOTE A SAILOR CANNABIS IN VIOLATION OF THE MEDICINAL AND ADULT USE CANNABIS REGULATION AND SAFETY ACT. THIS WILL ALLOW LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO BRING ABATEMENT ACTIONS REMOVING THE ADS IN QUESTION AND STOPPING THE ILLEGAL SALES IN THEIR TRACKS. JOINING ME BY PHONE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS STEVE NEAL FROM LONG BEACH THE LONG BEACH COLLECTIVE ASSOCIATION AND DOUGLAS HOWARD HOWARD THE LONG BEACH CITY PROSECUTOR- MISTER CHECK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF WILL NOW MOVE ON TO KEY WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AGAINST THE WITNESSES AND SUPPORT WE HAVE TWO LISTED UP TO TWO MINUTES EACH. AND IT WILL BEGIN WITH MISTER NEAL. GOOD A GOOD MORNING AND OUT THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL THANK YOU CHAIRMAN LOW AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND OUT WE STAND THE STRONG SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATION THE LONG BEACH THE A BC EIGHT WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE CITY OF LONG BEACH AND ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS- ON THIRD LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD. IN THE LEGAL CANNABIS MARKETS AS ALL OF YOU KNOW THE LIFTED MARKET HAS NEARLY 80% OF CANNABIS FAILED SO. BAD IN ITSELF IS A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE. AB THIRTY THREE THIRTY GIVE OF ANOTHER TOOL AND JURISDICTION TO COMBAT THE LIST OF MARK SO WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THE ITEM THE BILL PROVIDES CONSUMER PROTECTION AND THAT ALSO STRENGTHENED THE LEGAL CANNABIS MARKET AND- WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL NOW MOVE ON TO MISTER HUBBARD AND- THE CITY OF LONG BEACH OR THE PROTECTION OF LONG BEACH. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN LOW- I AM THE CITY PROSECUTOR FOR THE CITY OF LONG BEACH MY OFFICE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR AND FOURTEEN STATE AND LOCAL LAW. AND I'VE BEEN OUT TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO ENSURE A. B. THIRTY THREE THIRTY IS BOTH LAWFUL AND EFFECTIVE AND HAS WRITTEN IT IS POLL. AS BACKGROUND- ON THE PROBLEM FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND CITIES LIKE LONG BEACH. HAVE ATTEMPTED TO CREATE A REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT WHERE CANNABIS IN CANNABIS PRODUCTS ARE ARE GROWN MANUFACTURE TRANSPORTED AND SOLD IN A SAFE MANNER WORDS KEPT OUT OF THE HANDS OF CHILDREN. WHERE NEIGHBORHOOD IMPACTS ARE MINIMIZED IN WORK CONSUMERS I GET CANNABIS THAT IS SAFE AND TESTED AND FREE OF HARMFUL PESTICIDES. THAT THAT ENTIRE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT- COLLAPSES IN CANNOT EXIST- IF THERE CONTINUES TO BE A PROLIFERATION OF UNLAWFUL DISPENSARIES AND DELIVERY SERVICES. FOR THE LAST YEAR MY OFFICE HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN SIGNIFICANT INVESTIGATIONS OF THE PROBLEM AND WHAT POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS EXIST. AND WE FOUND THAT THE KEY TO STOPPING UNLAWFUL DISPENSARIES AND DELIVERY SERVICES IS TO REIN IN THEIR ABILITY TO REACH CONSUMERS THROUGH ADVERTISING. AND MARKETING. I AB THIRTY THREE THIRTY PROHIBITS A PERSON FROM COLLECTING COMPENSATION FOR ADVERTISING OR MARKETING THE SAILOR PROVISION OF CANNABIS ARE CANNABIS PRODUCTS. UNLESS THE SAILOR PROVISION IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE AND LOCAL CANNABIS LAWS. IF THERE'S ANY QUESTION ABOUT THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM OR THE URGENCY OF THE PROBLEM LAST YEAR'S BUDGET HAD ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED APPROXIMATELY ONE BILLION DOLLARS. IN REVENUE FROM THE LEGAL TALE CANNABIS HOWEVER THE ILLICIT MARKET. BECAME SO LARGE THAT THE STATE LOST UPPER SIX HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS. REVENUE BILL THAT'S REVENUE THAT OF ESPECIALLY IN TODAY'S ENVIRONMENT THE STATE CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE. I WITHOUT CONCLUDING JUST BANK I THINK THE SIMPLY MEMBER.

MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GEORGE MILLER ON BEHALF BELIEVE MAPS- THAT WAS EXPRESS OUR OPPOSITION MAYBE THIRTY THIRTY THIRTY AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN. A SIMPLE MAN AND IN ITS CURRENT FORM THIS LEGISLATION HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CAPTURE. ACROSS MULTIPLE MEDIA PLATFORMS WHO ARE NOT INTENSELY SUPPORTING THE ILLICIT CANNABIS MARKET PLACE. WELL THIS LEGISLATION DOES NOT TACKLE THE PRICE PARITY. AND DEMAND FACTORS THAT LARGELY FEEL THE I'M LICENSE MARKET PLACE IT DOES THIS INCENTIVIZE AND PUNISH INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES THAT ARE SUPPORTING ELLIS ITSELF THROUGH ADVERTISING OR MARKETING. WE APPLAUD THE OP THERE FOR HIS ATTEMPTS TO DO SO. UNFORTUNATELY AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN IT DOES NOT FACTORED IN THAT OR THE LACK THEREOF. OF ANY SUCH ENTITY TO AID AND I'M LICENSE CAMERAS BUT SO C. IF YOU MAY BE AWARE WITH MAPS IS WORK TO REMOVE ON LICENSE BUSINESSES. FROM OUR PLATFORM AND CONTINUE TO DO SO. WITH STATE REGULATOR TO AND THAT IN AVERAGE. IN THE STATE OF OUR OF THE WAY BUSINESSES ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED PROCESSES. TO ALLOW FOR THE FLYING OF ADVERTISEMENTS THAT ARE SUSPECTED TO BE FROM- LICENSE BUSINESSES SPECIFICALLY WE ENCOURAGE ANYONE TO FIGHT THIS MISSUS ACTIVITY. DIRECTLY ON OUR WEBSITE. WE THAT WE ALSO WORK WITH THE STATE'S DATABASES AN ADVERTISER TO RECTIFY ANY DISCREPANCIES IF CORRECTIVE ACTION ON AN ACCURATE INFORMATION DOES NOT SUFFICE OR ABOUT LICENSE NUMBER IS NOT PROVIDED THE ADVERTISEMENTS PROBABLY REMOVE MARK. FOR UNFORTUNATELY. WITHOUT FACTORING IN TEN INTO INTENT AB THIRTY THREE THIRTY.

SHE HAD THE CONVERSATIONS THE AUTHOR HIS STAFF AND THE CURRENT DATE BUT HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO RESOLVE ARE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH THE MEASURE IN PRACTICE. AND I'LL BE HEARD EIGHTY ANYTHING. MMHM CIVIL LIABILITY ON MEDIA COMPANIES INCLUDING THOSE AND OUTDOOR ADVERTISING INDUSTRY EVEN THOUGH WE'RE NOT SURE THAT OUR INDUSTRY IS INVOLVED WITH THE COMPLIANCE ISSUES THAT HAVE% BEEN CITED RELATED ONLINE- ADVERTISING- ARE WE ARE VERY CONCERNED WHEN. THE AB PENALTIES- ADDRESS THIRTY SOME DOLLARS FOR EACH VIOLATION ON MEDIA COMPANIES AND IF I'M LICENSE OPERATORS MIGHT FOR AND BURDEN PUBLISH AN ATTIC AND EXISTING LAW REQUIRES OUTDOOR ADVERTISERS TO DISPLAY THE LICENSE NUMBER OF THE HAMMOND LIGHTEN BUT NO MORE. AB RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ADVERTISEMENT AND IT IS THE PRACTICE OF THE MEMBERS OF THAT THE OTHER WAY REQUIRE CANNABIS ADVERTISERS TO PROVIDE A PROPER LICENSE NUMBER FOR ANY PROPOSED AT. WE REMAIN VERY CONCERNED HOWEVER THAT WE DO NOT HAVE A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BUREAU CANNABIS CONTROL AND WILL NOT HAVE ANY WAY TO KNOW THE LICENSE ADVERTISER HAD A LICENSE REVOKED OR SUSPENDED AFTER CONTRACT. NINE FURTHER WE POINTED PAGE TWO OF THE ANALYSIS THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE BILL THE BY. PUBLIC NUISANCES ALLOWING ANY MAY OF THE- BRING AN ACTION FOR A BI. WE'RE VERY CONCERNED THAT THIS COULD LEAD TO EXTENSIVE LEGAL EXPENSES OR PRESSURE TO ENTER SETTLEMENT EVEN WHEN OUR MEMBERS MAY HAVE THE ABILITY TO PREVAIL. WELL WE APPRECIATE THE GOAL OF HAVING EAGLE RULES FOR ALL MEDIA HI CURRENT LAW ALREADY DIFFERENTIATE. BETWEEN MEDIA BASED ON EACH UNIQUE PLATFORMS CHARACTERISTICS OUT FOR OUTDOOR ADVERTISING FOR EXAMPLE IS SUBJECT TO LAWS REQUIRING LICENSE NUMBER. THE THING REQUIREMENTS FROM STATE BOUNDARIES PARKS. GIVEN THE DIVERSE WAY AND WHAT'S DIFFERENT MEDIA REACHES ITS BODY ANSWER THE QUESTION WHETHER IT'S POSSIBLE OR APPROPRIATE TO SUBJECT ALL ADVERTISING MEDIA CHU IDENTICAL REGULATION. IN CONCLUSION LIKE SO MANY INDUSTRIES DURING THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMICS OUTDOOR ADVERTISING INDUSTRY HAS BEEN HIT HARD AS ADVERTISERS HAVE BUDGET. ASK FOR DISCOUNTS USING THE SHELTER IN PLACE ORDER THE JUSTIFICATION BUT YOUR CONSUMERS ARE SEEING BILLBOARDS OR CANCEL CONTRACT ALL TOGETHER.

OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB NINETEEN SIXTY NINE TODAY I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR CONTINUED WORK DURING THIS UNIQUE LEGISLATIVE SESSION IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE FORMER ASSEMBLY MEMBER KEVIN DE LEóN INTRODUCED AND PASSED EIGHTY NINETY NINE A BILL WHICH ADDED MATRICULA CONSULAR TO THE LIST OF ACCEPTABLE ID'S FOR. HELLO THIS. FUTURE LEGISLATION CREATED THE CALIFORNIA PALM- SECONDHAND DEALERS SYSTEM OTHERWISE KNOWN AS CAPS. THE SYSTEM IS A SINGLE STATEWIDE REPORTING SYSTEM OPERATED BY DO GA. WHERE INFORMATION AND TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED. IN THE LAST TWO YEARS THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE CAPS IS REPORTING SYSTEM IS BEING COMPROMISED FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT USE. MY PRETTY GOOD LUCK ON SELECT AS A FORM OF IDENTIFICATION. A SIGNIFICANT PATTERN HAVE EMERGED WHERE BY A CUSTOMER WHO USES THE MY PARTICULAR COMES ALIVE. IN A POND LOAN BECOMES  PERSON OF INTEREST IN AT THE IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICES. WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE CONTINUED EFFORT TO PROTECT OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES WE CAN ONLY- BUT THE CONCLUSION THAT THIS INFORMATION IS BEING RELEASED BY A SMALL GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS WITH ACCESS TO CAPS. THIS LET US BE CLEAR ON THIS BILL THE PUMP. I WOULD LOCALLY. AND READ AL OF THE BECAUSE FROM. WE CURRENTLY DO EVERY PART OF CURRENTLY TO THE TWO CATS. HOWEVER IF A MATRICULA CONSULAR WAS USED AS ID PERSONAL INFORMATION WOULD BE RETAINED LOCALLY FIVE NUMBER. TO ACCESS THIS INFORMATION LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN SIMPLY REQUEST BE OMITTED INFORMATION FROM THE SPECIFIC BROKER THAT WAS LOCALLY RETAIN. AB NINETEEN SIXTY NINE IS A VERY MILD AND SIMPLE STAFF IT WILL PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES FROM ENTITIES THAT ARE NOT USING THE CAP SYSTEM. AS INTENDED WITHOUT PLACING UNDUE STRESS ON LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATIONS. HERE WITH ME TODAY SPEAKING I HAVE MISTER BILL TO PLEASE THEM WHO WILL SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FARMWORKERS THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WELL MISTER TO PLACE YOU WILL THAT ALLOW UP TO A TWO MINUTES OF TESTIMONY AND WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOU COMING BACK TO THE FLOOR.

NEEDED VERY MUCH THERE'S A AS IT GOES ON BECAUSE IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA. AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO AND HER STAFF MAKING THIS POSSIBLE. WHEN THE MATRICULA CONSULAR CAME IN IN NINETEEN- TWO THOUSAND I'M DATING MYSELF THERE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE. THE SITUATION GOT VERY GOOD FOR THE CAPS SYSTEM OVER THE O. J. BECAUSE IT ENCOURAGE MORE AND MORE PEOPLE TO COME WITH LEGITIMATE IDENTIFICATION RATHER THAN USING CIRCUITS THINGS OF THAT NATURE. I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU. IF THIS WERE TO SEIZE HAPPENING. ABOUT THIS- IT'S NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD AND I KNOW THAT SOME OF THE FOLKS THAT HAVE- OPPOSED TO. HAVE A- ARTICULATED HOW THIS SITUATION WILL GO. VERBALLY TO MEMBERS OFFICES AND MEMBERS AND AS JUST ISN'T JUST AIN'T THAT WAY IT'S JUST NOT THAT WAY AT ALL I WONDER EXPLAIN THAT ONE IN PALM BROKER RECEIVES AN ITEM FROM SOMEONE USING A MATRICULA CONSULAR AS THEIR FOR A FORM OF IDENTIFICATION WHICH IS THEIR RIGHT. THEY TAKE THAT ITEM IN THE REPORTS THAT WE GENERATE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE BOTH PERSONAL INFORMATION AND PROPERTY INFORMATION. AND THE WHOLE BEING OF THE WHOLE WHOLE EXISTENCE OF REPORTING IS FOR PROPERTY- REPORTING AND IT'S THE AUSPICES THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS. TO GET THESE LOCAL MISSION. THIS BILL IS FOR THE NEXT THE- THESE MISTER DEPOSIT. ANYWAY TO GET THESE REPORTS IN THE FIRST PLACE- AND THAT'S WHY THEY'RE NOT WARRANTLESS REPORTS IN THAT CASE WARNER SIR WARRANTLESS SEIZURE. THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER WHO'S LOOKING THROUGH A PROPERTY REPORT AND HE SEES- HERE'S A ROLEX WATCH THAT I HAVE SINCE SOME CURIOSITY ABOUT- BUT THERE'S NO PERSONAL INFORMATION. BECAUSE WITH THE MATRICULA CONSULAR- BOND BROKERS WILL NOT HAVE TO BE GIVING PERSONAL INFORMATION. THE ONLY HAVE TO TRANSMIT THE PROPERTY INFORMATION WHEN THEY DO THAT THIS THE NAME OF THE PAWNBROKER THE PHONE NUMBER THE PAWNBROKER THE- EMAIL ADDRESS THE PAWNBROKER WILL BE RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM ON THAT SCREEN IT RUNS CONTINUOUSLY. IN FRONT OR BEHIND THE SCREEN I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW THAT WORKS BUT- AND THEY CAN SIMPLY CALL THEY CAN TAXED THEY CAN EMAIL. TELL ME SOMETHING- CALL ME OF- IMMEDIATELY ABOUT THE REPORT NUMBER NOW THAT EITHER THE- AND THE PAWNBROKER HAS TO COMPLY IMMEDIATELY. SO ALL THIS DOES IS DELAY THE PERSONAL INFORMATION TRANSMITTAL.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. YES THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT- ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AN ACT RELATING TO EFFORTS AS ENFORCEMENT OF MY LIFE IS KIND OF HIS BUSINESSES. AS YOU KNOW THE SENATE- THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BEGAN ISSUING LICENSES AT THE BEGINNING OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. FOR KIND OF ITS BUSINESSES TO OPERATE IN THE STATE. I TO DATE THIS BY SOME SUCCESS THE SINGLE BIGGEST ISSUE WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LEGAL KIND OF ITS MARKET. IS THAT WE HAVE THE WRITING LEVEL ILLEGAL MARKET- ACCORDING TO RECENT REPORTS EAGLE FEATHERS IN CALIFORNIA OUTNUMBERED LEGAL. BUSINESSES NEARLY THREE TO ONE THIS REPORT FOUND THAT WHILE CALIFORNIA CANISTERS COLLECTIVELY PRODUCE ABOUT NINE MILLION POUNDS OF CAMPUS PER YEAR. BUT THE MAN IN THE LEGAL CANNABIS MARKET CAN ONLY SUPPORT ONE POINT EIGHTY TWO POINT TWO MILLION POUNDS PER YEAR. THIS LEAVES ABOUT 80% OF THE CROP EITHER TO BE DESTROYED OR TO. MAKE ITS. WAY TO THE ILLICIT MARKET. IF ARE PUT THE- OF THE LEGAL CAN MARKET AROUND EIGHT POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR ALL OF THIS ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IS BOTH CONTACTED UNREGULATED. IN ADDITION TO TWENTY IN TAX REVENUES THE UNDERGROUND MARKET REPRESENTS SERIOUS PUBLIC SAFETY AND PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS TO OUR COMMUNITY. NEWS ARTICLES FROM AROUND THE STATE HAVE DOCUMENTED VIOLENCE AND CRIME ON THE UP AT LEAST A LICENSE DISPENSARIES. IN ADDITION THE CANNABIS PRODUCTS SOLD AT THESE LOCATIONS DOES NOT MEET ESTABLISH QUALITY STANDARDS AN INMATE. STATE TESTING. AS WE CAN SEE HERE TODAY COMBATING THE UNDERGROUND MARKET IS A KEY POLICY GOAL FOR THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR. THIS BILL WILL TARGET THE ILLICIT MARKET BY CREATING CIVIL PENALTIES FOR INDIVIDUALS FOUND TO BE AIDING AND ABETTING THE SALE OF A LICENSE CANDIDATES. EXAMPLES OF AB AND ABETTING BE AN ADVERTISER WHO NOT ONLY AND INTENTIONALLY DIRECT BUSINESSES TO ANALYZE THIS SHOP AS WELL AS WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST YEARS. ANOTHER EXAMPLE COULD BE A PROPERTY OWNER WHO KNOWINGLY ACCEPT CASH TO EASE HIS OR HER PROPERTY FOR ANY LEGAL SHOP TO OPERATE. THE FACILITY. AT THE LEGISLATURE WE CANNOT SAY THAT WE ARE TAKING THE CANNABIS BLACK MARKET SERIOUSLY. IF WE ALLOW THE UNDERGROUND PROMOTION ADVERTISEMENT IN SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE BUSINESSES. TO EXIST WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE. WE KNOW THAT THESE ADVERTISEMENTS AND PROPERTY OWNERS DRIVE BUSINESS WITH EQUAL OPERATORS. AND WE MUST FIND A WAY TO RESTRICT THESE PRACTICE PRACTICES.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS- TODAY I'M PRESENTING ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY NINE EIGHTY THREE. THE BILL ABOUT CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SAFETY AND HEALTH CARE. THE BILL INSURERS BUSINESS PRACTICES BY MAJOR PHARMACY PHARMACIES ARE IN LINE WITH THE CORRECT PRACTICE THE PHARMACY AND MEDICINE. CURRENTLY PHARMACIES USE AUTOMATIC SYSTEMS THAT WILL CONTACT THE DOCTOR THROUGH A FAX TO REQUEST A REFILL FOR PRESCRIPTION. FOR EXAMPLE THE DOCTOR PRESCRIBES A THIRTY DAY SUPPLY OF MEDICATION WITH THE WITH THREE REFILLS. OTHER THIRD REFILL WITH THE PATIENT'S PERMISSION THE PHARMACY WILL CONTACT THE DOCTOR TO RENEW THE PRESCRIPTION. THIS IS HELPFUL FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS TO TAKE DAILY MEDICATIONS BY REDUCE ANY LAG TIME BETWEEN REFILLS. HOWEVER SOME STORES ARE TAKEN THIS PROCESS A STEP TOO FAR I REQUEST THE REFILLS BEYOND WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY CHRIS PRESCRIBED. AND MORE THAN THE PATIENT SHOULD HAVE. SOMETIMES THIS IS A REQUEST ON BEHALF OF A PATIENT BUT AS GROWN INTO A BUSINESS PRACTICE TO RETAIN CUSTOMERS AT THE RISK. OF PATIENT SAFETY. THE PRACTICE ALSO INCLUDES BOMBARDING DOCTORS OFFICES WITH FAXES UNTIL THEY RESPOND. FAR BEYOND WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY DONE OVERWHELMING THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE AND STAFF. OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WAS OVERTAXED EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. THE COMBINATION OF CHANGE REFILL REQUEST WITH THE BOMBARDMENT OF REQUEST CAN EASILY LEAD TO MISTAKES WHEN APPROVING THE DISPENSING MEDICATIONS TO PATIENTS. WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN EXAMPLES OF THESE MISTAKES. BUT THESE ARE MORE THAN MISTAKES THE RESULT. THEY ARE RESULT OF DECISIONS BY THESE COMPANIES TO PURSUE MORE AGGRESSIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES. A NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE IN JANUARY DOCUMENTED EXAMPLES OF ONE CHAIN DRUGSTORE ROUTINELY REQUESTING AND DISPENSING THREE MONTH SUPPLY OF PSYCHIATRIC DRUGS DESPITE DOCTOR'S URGING THEM NOT TO. IT ALSO SHOWED DOCTORS OFFICES BEING OVERWHELMED WITH THE REQUEST THAT ORIGINATED WITH THE PHARMACY AND NOT THE PATIENT. SO THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT IS IMPACTING PERCOLATING ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I'VE ALSO HEARD FROM DOCTORS IN MY DISTRICT WHO HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR FIX TO THIS ISSUE FOR A LONG TIME. AB TWENTY NINE EIGHTY THREE WOULD RESTORE BALANCE BY PROHIBITING A PHARMACY FROM AUTOMATICALLY REQUESTED A REFILL. FOR PATIENT UNLESS THEY HAVE PERMISSION FROM THE PATIENT. OR THE DOCTOR. THIS WILL LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF REFILLS REQUESTED AT THE DISCRETION OF THE PHARMACY WITHOUT PATIENT FOR DOCTOR INPUT. IT ALSO PROHIBITS THEM FROM REQUESTED REFILLS BEYOND WHAT THE DOCTOR ORIGINALLY PRESCRIBED. SO THEY CAN% CONTINUE TO PRACTICE THE REQUESTED REFILLS ON BEHALF OF PATIENTS AS THEY SHOULD. BUT THE NUMBER OF REFILLS THE PATIENT RECEIVES SHOULD NOT BE RECOMMENDED BY PHARMACY. DO I BELIEVE THE NEED IS URGENT I RECOGNIZE IT IS NECESSARY. A TO ALLOW THE SYSTEM TO ADOPT OUTSIDE THE CURRENT CRISIS. THAT IS WHY I AGREE TO DELAY IMPLEMENTATION UNTIL JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND I APPRECIATE THE CHAIR AND HIS COMMITTEE FOR COLLABORATING WITH THOSE AND TRY TO FIND A WAY TO ADDRESS THE TIMING ISSUE. TODAY I HAVE DOCTORS WALK FOR. OUR SHE AND EVA PRONE TO TESTIFY ABOUT THIS PRACTICE AND HOW IT'S AFFECTED THEIR WORK AND THEIR PATIENTS. AND RESPECTFUL AFTER I'VE- THANK YOU VERY MUCH A SUMMER HOLDEN AND IT'S JUST AS A POINT OF CLARIFICATION TO- TO REFER TO REAFFIRM FOR COMMITTEE THE CONVERSATION WITH PERSPECTIVE DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION IS SOMETHING THAT I YOU ARE ACKNOWLEDGING AND WOULD LIKE TO. MOVE FORWARD AND IMPLEMENT SHOULD THIS WE'VE COMMITTEE AS WELL THAT'S CORRECT. IN FULL GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCHTHEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO- MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. WE MOVE ON TO KEY WITNESS TESTIMONY. UP TO TWO MINUTES OF FOR KEY WITNESS TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT. PLEASE BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. HI AND MY NAME IS EVA PAN AND I AM A BOARD CERTIFIED INTERNAL MEDICINE PHYSICIAN AND PRIVATE PRACTICE. I WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY NINETY THREE. THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE AUTOMATIC RESULT THIS DOWN DEFEAT THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF SUCH A SYSTEM. THE PURPOSE OF THE AUTOMATIC REFILL SYSTEM WITH THE STREAMLINED THE MEDICATION REFILL PROCESS. AND ABOUT MEDICATION AND HERE I THINK CRIME DISEASE MANAGEMENT. INSTEAD PHYSICIANS HAVE BECOME OVER BURDENED WITH AN ORDER AND NUMBER REFILL REQUEST COMING BY FACT ANY PRESCRIBED. WHEN THE AUTOMATED SYSTEM. IN MY EXPERIENCE THIS IS A CONSISTENT PRACTICE OF THE SYSTEM TO REQUEST AN APPROPRIATE WE FELT THAT. BECAUSE THE DANGER TO PATIENT. WEEK I WOULD RECONCILE YOU MIGHT BE MEDIC. DURING A TELL THAT THAT. OUT SHE WAS RECEIVING AUTOMATIC REFILL THE OLD BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICATION THAT WAS PRESCRIBED ON JULY OF LAST YEAR I ANY CHANGES MEDICATION DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR THE SYSTEM PULLED UP HER OLD MEDICATION WITH THE REMAINING RESULT. IN GAVE IT TO HER IN THE MARCH UNBEKNOWNST TO ME THE PATIENT HERSELF AND EVEN THE PHARMACIST. THE SEVERE CONSEQUENCES OF OPTIMAL BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL OR STROKE AND HEART ATTACK. THE SITUATION IS FURTHER EXACERBATED BY THE CODE PANDEMIC IN WHICH IS THE TELEMEDICINE THAT THAT WERE MARCHING LIMITED DUE TO LACK OF PP. MICHAEL PROVIDERS ARE SPENDING A DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT TIMES DURING THE LEGITIMACY OF THESE ARE CLASS. WHICH CREATES A TREMENDOUS AN UNNECESSARY BURDEN ON OUR PRACTICAL. INCOME WITH INTERNET ONLY FURTHER STRESSES THE IMPORTANCE OF PATIENT SAFETY AND THE NEED TO LEVY A POSITION FATIGUE. COURAGE FOR THE SHOW WORKFORCE RETENTION AND ECONOMICALLY TRYING TIME. I COULD NOT IT'S AUTOMATIC REFILL PRACTICE IS BEING DRIVEN BY ECONOMIC INSTEAD OF THE PHARMACIES AND NOT YOUR BY WHAT IS BEST FOR THE PATIENT. ULTIMATELY THE RESULT IN PATIENT INJURY POSITION FATIGUE AND HIGHER HEALTHCARE COSTS. THE RESULT YOU REQUIRE CONTENT AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE PRACTITIONER OF THESE ACTIONS FALL UNDER THE BURDEN OF THE PRACTICE WITH. MEDICINE WE DON'T TWENTY NINE THREE WILL HELP AND- THAT THE RELATIONS BETWEEN DOT PATIENT ARE. MAY BALLOT WALAU FOR CONVENIENCE AND IF YOU'RE COMMUTING MEDICAL. THE THANK YOU.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT BILL IS ON CALL. AND I WILL PASS OVER TO OUR VICE CHAIR AS NOW BE PRESENTING A NUMBER OF BILLS. NOW WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO FILE ITEM TWENTY SIX A. B. NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT BY THE CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER VICE CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES- THIS IS ASSEMBLY BILL. NINETEEN NINETY NINE. NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT EXCUSE ME- AS YOU MAY RECALL OF SORT OF OUR CHEAP PURPOSE AND FOCUS HAS BEEN WITH RESPECT TO CONSUMER PROTECTION THAT IS THAT OF THE AREA OF EXPERTISE IN THIS ARENA AND PART OF THE NOTION WAS SUCH THAT WE LOOKED AT. THE SUNSET EXTENSIONS DURING A NUMBER OF ENTITIES INCLUDING THAT OF THE DENTAL BOARD AND PART OF THAT DISCOVERIES TO LOOK INTO CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND ASSOCIATED ISSUES OF FROM THAT IT BECAME VERY APPARENT THAT THERE WERE UNSCRUPULOUS PRACTICES GOING ON WITH PREDATORY PRACTICES SPECIFICALLY. IN HURTING CONSUMERS SIMILARLY WE'VE MENTIONED THEN AND PASSING LEGISLATION THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO ADVANCE THE ISSUES ON CONSUMER PROTECTION AB PLACE WHAT IT IS SO SUCH THAT THERE IS THIS NOTION OF THIS TELL IT TO STREET AND THESE PRODUCTS WHICH FRANKLY IS. TELE CRAP SALUTE OR TO SEE WHAT EXACT OCCURRING WHAT I MEAN BY THIS YOU MIGHT THINK WELL WE'VE BEEN HEARING FROM OPPOSITION THAT THIS PER DOMINANTLY HURTS. COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WELL IT'S ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE FACTS THE FACTS OP SPECIFICALLY THAT ARE VERY OWN ATTORNEY GENERAL OBVIOUS HERE AS A DISCIPLINARY ACTION AGAINST COMPANY WITH THIS SEC. AN AIR FRANCE IN. FRAUD GROW SICK WE GROSS NEGLIGENT TREE. AIDING ABETTING A- DENTISTRY ADVERTISE TO MISLEAD OUR OWN ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS THIS PLAN ACTIONS AGAINST COMPANIES IN THIS INDUSTRY. BUT IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT MAYBE HAVE A THAT CLOSE TO TWO THOUSAND COMPLAINTS FROM THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU OR THE PRACTICES TO WHICH WE SEE THESE COMPANIES SUING THE DENTAL BOARDS IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA OR ALABAMA. OR THAT'S NOT ENOUGH LET'S SAY LESTER HOLT OF NIGHTLY NEWS DOES A CONSUMER REPORTS. PIECE THAT DEMONSTRATES THE- SCRUPULOUS PREDATORY ACTIONS. WHAT IS THE COMPANY DO. THIS CURRENTLY OF LAWSUIT TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR LAWSUIT. FROM THESE COMPANIES AGAINST NBC. WHAT IS A NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE SAY THIS COMPANY SAYS IT WILL FIX YOUR SMILE. BUT IT ALSO MAY SHUT YOU. IF IT DOESN'T. WAS THE LA TIMES SAY BRACE YOURSELF FOR THE REST. WHAT DOES FOX NEWS SAY. COSTING CONSUMERS MORE WHAT IS REUTERS SAY TALK ABOUT THE CRACKDOWN FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. MEMBERS THIS IS SPECIFICALLY THAT OF OUR CONSUMER PROTECTION IN PLACE NOW YOU'LL HEAR FROM ADVOCATES THAT. THIS IS ANTI INNOVATION THAT WE SHOULD SUPPORT TELE DENTISTRY. BUT THIS IS SUB PAR. CONSUMER ADVOCACY THIS IS HURTING COMMUNITIES. AND THAT IS WHY IT IS IN OUR BEST INTEREST TO PROTECT CONSUMERS. IT BRINGS ME NO DELIGHT AS THE MEMBER FROM SILICON VALLEY TO TAKE ON. AN INDUSTRY THAT LIKES TO PROMOTE ITSELF AS THE INNOVATION ECONOMY. BUT FRANKLY WE ALSO NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE PROTECTIONS ARE IN PLACE TO PROTECT PEOPLE AND WE SHOULD NOT TO LOOK AT JUST SHAREHOLDER PROFIT AT THE EXPENSE OF EVERYDAY PEOPLE. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS FUNCTION FUNDAMENTALLY IS ABOUT THIS BILL BEFORE US REQUIRES THEN THAT YOU HAVE IN IN PERSON pAND PROFESSIONS. WE OVERSEE A LOT OF THE LICENSE CATEGORIES. AS AN EXAMPLE MY FATHER'S AN ATOMIC TRISTEN I DOCTOR. AND SIMILARLY HE WOULD LIKE ME TO PURCHASE THESE GLASSES AT HIS OFFICE. BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW SO HAVE A GOOD SELECTION HIS STYLE IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. SO WHAT I DO. I ASKED HIM FOR THE PRESCRIPTION. HE LEGALLY OBLIGATED TO GIVE ME MY PRESCRIPTION SO- I DO I GO TO THE MALL I'M READY TO WATCH A MOVIE THE LINES LONG AT THE RESTAURANT SO I GO TO THE MALL I SEE ALL THESE FRAMES. WELL I HAVE A PRESCRIPTION I GO AND PURCHASE. THE FRIENDS MYSELF. IT'S THAT CHOICE. BUT I MUST DO SO IN AN INFORMED FASHION. AND WE CANNOT BYPASS THE CONSULTATION OF A DOCTOR TO BE ABLE TO. UTILIZED PRODUCTS THAT COULD CAUSE SIGNIFICANT HARM. SIMILARLY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WHY IS IMPORTED GET AN X. RAY IN PERSON FOR A VISIT WITH YOUR DENTIST AS WELL PERHAPS YOU MIGHT HAVE THE K. CAVITIES SHORTEN ROUTES OR GUM DISEASE. THE PRODUCT MIGHT NOT BE SUITABLE FOR YOU IN THAT CASE. SO WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE. THAT'S WHY THIS IS A SIMPLE PROTECTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE- COORDINATION WITH YOUR DOCTOR. ENSURING THAT THIS IS AN ELIGIBLE PRODUCTS AND YOU CAN UTILIZED SAFELY. EVER THAT'S WHAT THIS CONVERSATION IS ABOUT AND WITH INTELLIGENCE OF A VICE CHAIR ALSO HAVE A FEW BOARDS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR VICE CHAIR THESE ARE SPECIFICALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE TYPE OF RISKS I THIS IS A POST ON SOCIAL MEDIA EVERY TIME I PUT. THEM IN. STARTS BLEEDING HERE IT IS. EVEN DIRECTLY FROM ONE OF THE COMPANIES AS A RESPONSE FROM THE COMPANY'S PUBLIC LISTING HERE SMILE DIRECT CLUB BASE THEY REPLIED TO CONSUMER SAYING ALL MEMBERS ARE REQUIRED TO VISIT A DENTIST. SIR SAYING YOU REQUIRE THEM TO VISIT THE DENTIST ANYWAY BUT HERE'S THE REALITY. NO ONE READS THE CONSENT FORMS AND JUST CLICK YOU JUST CLICK AWAY. BUT THEY SAY SO THEMSELVES YOU'RE REQUIRED TO VISIT THE DENTIST. OTHER PEOPLE SAY I COULDN'T STOP TALKING IT WAS VERY PAINFUL. AND THEN HERE'S WHAT THEY SAY IN THE FINE PRINT ALL OF THESE COMPANIES. THAT IS THE ONLY ADDRESS THE ALIGNMENT OF MY TEETH- NOT CORRECT MY EXISTING BITE CONDITION. MY TEETH WILL BE STRAIGHTER THAN THEY CURRENTLY ARE BUT WILL STILL BE COMPROMISED. ALTHOUGH MY TEETH WILL BE STRAIGHTER ANY PRE EXISTING BY CONDITIONAL REMAIN COMPROMISED. SO AGAIN WE'RE LOOKING AT PRACTICES IT IS THAT AREA OF JURISDICTION FOR OUR COMMITTEE TO LOOK AT CONSUMER PROTECTION. AGAINST THESE TECH ROAST ARE LOOKING TO JUST MAKE A QUICK DOLLAR ASKING FOR FORGIVENESS THAN FOR PERMISSION AND IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US IN A DUE DILIGENCE A PUBLIC PROTECTION IN THIS COMMITTEE OF BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS. TO GO AFTER IT AND AGAIN LET'S LOOK AT THE FACTS. AND THAT'S WHY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS A DISCIPLINARY ACTION. ALL ACROSS THE SPECTRUM ON A WIDE VARIETY OF PRACTICES. SO AGAIN THIS BILL IS SENSIBLE AND ENSURING THAT YOU HAVE. THAT X. RATE FROM THAT VISIT IN PERSON VISIT. VERY REASONABLE. WHILE ALSO SUPPORTING THE DIVISION THAT STILL EXISTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE. THERE'S A MOTION AND A SECOND WITH THE MODERATOR PLEASE OPEN UP THE LINE FOR THE MAIN WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. HELLO RIGHT. HI GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS MERRY IN WITH HELP DONALD.

THAT'S CORRECT THANK YOU. I'LL BRING IT BACK TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ANY% MEMBERS WISHING TO COMMENT OR QUESTION MR GRAYSON. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR I DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS AND ONE OF THEM. IS IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT- SMILED DIRECTS PRODUCT TARGETS THE- TOP AND BOTTOM SIXTEENTH ON THE FRONT ON THE FRONT. IS THERE- IS THERE A WAY THAT THEY GUARANTEE THAT IT DOESN'T MOVE OR IMPACT THE OTHER TEETH. THAT ARE IN THE MOUTH I KNOW THAT'S A REAL TECHNICAL QUESTION. BUT DO THEY HAVE A GUARANTEE AND THERE'S A REASON WHY I ASK THAT. MY APOLOGIES I'M NOT THAT FAMILIAR WITH WHAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR- IT BUSINESS. IS ADVERTISING BUT I CAN SAY- THAT SPECIFICALLY- WITH RESPECT TO CARE. THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS DOES NOT FIX A BITE. WHEN FACT IS JUST COSMETIC SO THERE COULD BE SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATE HARM- SURROUNDING THIS BUT THEY AGAIN VERY MUCH INDICATE YOU HEARD FROM TESTIMONY THAT THIS IS. DENTAL CARE WHEN IN FACT ON THE DISCLOSURES SPECIFICALLY AT THAT LIGHT THAT PREVIOUSLY SHOWED YOU. THIS IS NOT A SPECIFICALLY AROUND THAT OF DENTAL CARE THEY JUST TALKED ABOUT THAT OF NOT FIXING THE BITE AND THE KNOWLEDGE THAT. SO I HEARD IT SAID- THAT THE COMPLAINS THAT THAT YOU MENTIONED TO BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU AND THINGS LIKE THAT. I HEARD IS SAID THAT THOSE COMPLAINTS WERE NOT NECESSARILY ABOUT. THE PRODUCT AS MUCH AS IT WAS ABOUT THE SERVICE THAT WAS BEING PROVIDED SO THERE'S KIND OF A- DISTANT GENUINE- CLAIMED THAT- THE PRODUCT IS DOING HARM. IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF MAYBE SOME BAD SERVICE THAT THE CUSTOMER GOT. A HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO DELINEATE BETWEEN WHAT WAS A PRODUCT ISSUE VERSES. A SERVICE ISSUE SURE THE AND THE EVIDENCE IT IS SUGGESTED IN IS VERY VERY CLEAR YES THERE'S A WIDE VARIETY OF COMPLAINTS FROM THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU. BUT WHEN YOU COMPOUND THAT. IN ADDITION TO THAT OF THE DISCIPLINARY ACTION SPECIFICALLY FOR FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ARE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND ALL THE ARTICLES AND FRANKLY. AS YOU WELL KNOW THE WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE IN LOOKING AT THE DETAILS COMING FROM THE SUNSET EXTENSION OF THE TEN SUPPORT. AND THAT ADVANCING AND CONTINUE THAT WHICH IS TO SAY THAT THE MORE WE DUG INTO THIS ISSUE. THE MORE THAT WE FOUND AND OF COURSE IT'S EASY POLITICS BEATING FOR ME JUST TO TURN A BLIND GUY.
