STRICTER MORE. APPROPRIATE BALANCE. SECOND WE ARE CAN THAT THIS BILL MAY ACT HAVE ON IN. CONSEQUENCE OF HINDERING. FROM TECH FAST REHABILITATION AND RE ENTRY INTO PROPRIETY PEOPLE REQUIRED TO REGISTER AS A SEX OFFENDER ALREADY FACE DIFFICULTY FINDING EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING REUNITING WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES AND PARTICIPATING IN DAILY LIFE. THE RESTRICTING A PERSON'S MOVEMENTS WILL ONLY CAUSE GREATER DESTABILIZATION AND COULD ULTIMATELY INCREASE A PERSON'S LIKE 3100% OF THE TIME AND LASTLY WE FEAR THAT PLACING A PERSON UNDER COURT ORDER POTENTIALLY FOR THE REMAINDER OF THEIR NATURAL LIVES.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. WHEN I SERVICE SUPERVISOR FOR THE COUNTY OF ORANGE OUR DISTRICT ATTORNEY CAME IN WITH THE AGENDA ITEM WHERE HE WANTED TO. PROHIBIT ANYONE ON THE. SEX OFFENDER LIST TO NOT BE ABLE TO GO TO OUR PUBLIC PARKS AND- IT JUST SEEMED LIKE A RIGHT JUST BILL OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T WANT SOMEONE ON THE SEX OFFENDER LIST TO GO TO. PARKS WHERE THERE'S- SMALL CHILDREN IN. AND ABOVE IT BUT READING THE BILL ARE THE BILL THE AGENDA ITEM WE WOULD CALL IT IS SUPERVISOR. THERE WERE SOME REAL CONCERNS ABOUT CONSTITUTIONAL. RIGHTS AND THE REST AND SO I WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. WITH THE BILL BUT HOW DO YOU OF OUR THE AGENDA ITEM BUT HOW DO YOU VOTE NO ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS. SO I VOTED FOR IT ONLY TO HAVE. L. HAVEN'T RULED IN COURT THAT IT WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. SO MY SUSPICIONS WERE CONFIRMED BUT- IT GOT ME ON A ON A JOURNEY- ON THIS A SEX OFFENDER LIST OR THE REGISTRATION ACT. IN NOT ALL. INDIVIDUALS ON THIS LIST ARE GUILTY OF RAPE THEY COULD'VE BEEN URINATING OUTSIDE IF YOU HAD NO. CONTACT PHYSICAL CONTACT WHATSOEVER. AND SO THERE BUT THERE WAS NO DE GRADATION. SO I BELIEVE IT WAS SENATOR WINNER THAT DID IT THE BILL THAT SAID LET'S HAVE SOME GRADATION AND I. I SUPPORTED THAT BILL IN. AND I KNOW IT'S TAKING. DEPARTMENT JUST A LONG TIME TO GET EVERYONE CATEGORIZE BECAUSE THAT'S YOU KNOW MANPOWER MANAGEMENT- CONCERNED WITH. SO I ET YOU SEE THAT THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON MADAM CHAIR WOULD YOU TAKE A LITTLE DEEPER INTO THIS TYPE OF. LEGISLATION YOU COULD TELL BY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT CALLED IN OPPOSITION. SO I'M I'M JUST HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ONE I APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY. OF A MISS MENDEZ BECAUSE I WANTED TO GET THE CONTEXT THAT WAS NOT IN MY- PORTS SO I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN BUT I ALSO HAVE THIS CONCERN WERE WITH THE PARK SITUATION YOU KNOW. EITHER YOU CAN TAKE YOUR KIDS TO THE PARK WEHAD ONE. WITNESS AT ONE BILL THAT- ACTUALLY SAID OUR ARMED I WAS THE CITIZEN OF THE YEAR. IN MY TOWN I'M A GOOD GUY I MADE A MISTAKE SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY BUT- YOU KNOW- WHY WHY SHOULD I BE PROHIBITED FROM TAKING MY KIDS TO THE- TO THE PART. TIME I'M JUST KIND OF LOOKING FOR BALANCE AS OPPOSED TO A SCARLET LETTER- AND I'M I'VE BEEN READING THE BILL AND I I'M NOT ALL AND BEING TOLD THAT IF YOU COMMIT A FELONY OFFENSE REQUIRING THAT YOU BE PUT ON THE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRATION. LIST THEN YOU COULD HAVE HAVE HAVE THIS EXTENDED FROM TEN YEARS TO MAYBE EVEN A LIFETIME. AND I'M JUST CURIOUS. ABOUT THE DETAILS ALL I COULD FIND WAS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT THAT ENTAILS BUT- IS THAT GOING TO BE A LIFE SENTENCE FOR A- FATHER OR MOTHER AND- HOW DOES THAT. IMPACT THE RAISING OF THE KIDS OR INVOLVEMENT WITH THE KIDS. AND THEN IT DOES LOOK A MENTION LOT ABOUT GUN OWNERSHIP WHICH I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE AND WANT TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM HAVING GUNS AND THEY CAN'T CONTROL THEIR TEMPERS. SOLD THIRD TRY TO CAN YOU CAN YOU HELP ME OUT A LITTLE BIT JUST TO TRY TO FIND THE BALANCE IN IN IT IS A TOO BRODEUR'S IT MORE SPECIFIC I'M JUST NOT GETTING IT. SAID THE BILL EIGHTEEN YOU MAY. RESPOND THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WILL A TWO MORE TO STILL ON THE LINE I WILL DEFER TO HIM ARE. YES GOOD MORNING THIS IS- DISTRICT ATTORNEY WARD MAY I- RESPOND TO- THE SENATORS- COMMENTS THERE YES BRIEFLY AND SPECIFICALLY. THANK YOU HI I THINK IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT- THIS BILL WILL TAKE EFFECT UPON- THE CHANGES THAT. SENATOR WINNERS BILL DID- THAT CHANGED AND REALLY REFORMED AND MODIFIED THE THREE TIER SEX REGISTRATION I TO THOUGHT THAT WAS A WELL MEASURE DEAL A CURRENT LAW DOES ALLOW. VICTIMS TO HAVE A PROTECTIVE ORDER UP TO TEN YEARS VIA THE CRIMINAL COURT- THE CRIMINAL COURT CASE- YOU DO- SENATOR YOU ARE CORRECT AND- THE CURRENT LAW DOES ALLOW AND CERTAIN FAMILY LAW SITUATIONS FOR. A LIFETIME RESTRAINING ORDER OF THE OF THE FAMILY COURT SO THE CONCEPT OF A RESTRAINING ORDER FOR THAT DURATION IS NOT IN AND OF ITSELF AND CONSTITUTIONAL- I WOULD FOCUS ON REALLY TWO ASPECTS ONE REALIZING THAT THE- YEAR TWO AND YEAR THREE OFFENDERS- DO REPRESENT THE MOST SERIOUS AND VIOLENT. MAYBE A BIT YOU'LL- OFFENDERS AND ALSO WHAT THIS BILL DOES DOES NOT- REALLY ADD TO THE EFFECT- HAVING THE ABILITY TO GO AND HAVE A RELEASE VIA THE CRIMINAL COURT A VICTIM CAN GO TO THE CIVIL COURTS AND GET A RESTRAINING ORDER. THAT'S A BALLOT FOR FIVE YEARS AND EVERY FIVE YEARS COME BACK TO COURT AND HAVE THAT READ- RE OPT OR RENEWED IF YOU WILL SO AGAIN THE PATIENT. IS OTHER UNDER. BILL DE INCLUDE TO PASS BECAUSE- ALL A- HEARING THE QUEUE WILL HAVE ACCESS TO A COUNCIL RIGHT TO COUNSEL AND THE HEARING IS NO COST TO HIM OR HER. JUST AS IT WOULD BE NO COST TO THE VICTIM SO IN A WAY CENTER WHAT WE'RE DOING IS KIND OF MOVING THE MECHANISM. OF IN A WAY A RIGHT THAT A VICTIM ALREADY HAS A FROM A CIVIL PROCEEDING TO A CRIMINAL HEATING AND ALL IN WITH THIS. THE BURDEN OF PROOF IN A CRIMINAL PROCEEDING- IS BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT WITH FOREIGN ABOVE THAT IS WHAT THE REQUIRED FOR A SCHOOL PROCEEDING- IN THIS CASE. COMMITTEE EVIDENCE. THANK YOU SO THAT YOU ARE SAYING THAT. TO IN TWO OR THREE OFFENDERS. IS WHAT THIS BILL WOULD APPLY TO. YES BUT IT GOES BY THE FIVE DESCRIBED THE CURRENT LAW. PROVIDE A FIVE C. DESCRIBED IF THE CURRENT LAW PROVIDES THE TEN YEARS AND IN INCREMENTS OF ADDITIONAL FIVE YEARS SO IN. THIS BILL IS YOU DESCRIBED. WHAT HE DESCRIBED YES THIS BILL AS WRITTEN WOULD COVER TIER TWO AND THREE. BUT IN FACT THE. THE RESTRAINING ORDER THAT WOULD BE TIED TO THE PAROLE WOULD BE LIFETIME. AND SO THE MANAGER WILL IF I MAY ASK THE QUESTION WHAT WHAT AM I DON'T I DON'T HAVE THE AMENDMENTS SEARCH PROPOSE BUT WHAT A MALE ANTHOLOGIES SO WHAT. BECAUSE AS- YOU POINTED OUT CENTER MORE LOCK. BE A THOSE WHO COMMIT A SEX OFFENSE. THE SEX OFFENSES ARE NOT ALL EQUAL AND- AS WE ADJUSTED IN ADJUSTING THEIR REGISTRY SENATOR WINNERS BILL WE RECOGNIZED THAT OUR PREVIOUS APPROACH TO THE REGISTRY WAS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL IN WAS INAPPROPRIATE AND SO WE CREATED A THREE TIERS AND THE FIRST YEAR PUT YOU ON A REGISTRY FOR- AND CORRECT ME CENTER WHEN FROM WRONG BUT FOR TEN YEARS THE SECOND TIER. TWENTY YEARS IN THE THIRTY YEARS BASICALLY PERMANENT. AND SO. IN UNDERSTANDING THE DA OBVIOUSLY. HAS IN MIND SOMETHING BROADER BUT IN UNDERSTANDING FROM A VICTIM PERSPECTIVE WHAT. ONE GOAL OF WHAT WAS TRYING TO BE ACCOMPLISHED WITH THIS LAW WAS TO PER TO PROTECT THE VICTIM AND NOT PUT A VICTIM IN THE SITUATION WHERE THE VICTIM HAS TO GO BACK TO CIVIL COURT TO GET TO CONTINUE AGAIN AND AGAIN TO GET A RESTRAINING ORDER IN THOSE CASES OF. BE THE THIRD TIER TYPE OF SEX OFFENSE AND SO WHAT THE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDED IS THAT THE BILL BE AMENDED SO THAT THIS PERTAINS TO EVERYONE WHO FALLS IN THE TIER THREE AND EFFECTIVE RONA FALLS IN THE TIER THREE. THERE'S A LITTLE VARIATION BUT BASICALLY- DANTE SOURCE NECK NERO'S THE CATEGORY OF OFFENSES AND NOW THERE ARE SOME WHO BELIEVE EVEN OUR AMENDMENT WOULD STILL BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL BECAUSE OF A POTENTIAL LACK OF JUDICIAL REVIEW. THAT DO DAY AGAIN THAT'S REALLY FOR THE COURTS TO DETERMINE- OF OUR PUBLIC SAFETY STAFF WOULDN'T HAVE DRAFTED SOMETHING THAT THEY WERE COMPLETELY CLEAR WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL IF YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY THEY WERE THEY WERE TRYING TO FOLLOW THE- THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS ALLOWABLE AND TO PROVIDE AN AMENDMENT THAT NEAR ROAD AND YET STILL GAVE THOSE VICTIMS. OF THOSE OUR WHAT WE CALL LIFE TIME FELONY SEXUAL OFFENSES THE TYPE THAT YOU GET A LIFE SENTENCE NO LIFE SENTENCE DOESN'T MEAN YOU SPEND YOUR ENTIRE LIFE IN PRISON. IT JUST MEANS THAT BEFORE YOU WOULD EVEN BE ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE YOU WOULD ALREADY HAVE BEEN IN PRISON FOR A GOOD NUMBER OF YEARS USUALLY MINIMUM OF TWENTY. BUT THEN IF YOU ARE SUCCESSFUL ON PAROLE AND IF WE LOOK AT THE HISTORY. IT'S IS THAT YOUR ABILITY TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING PROLES PRETTY LOW. BUT LET'S SAY YOU ARE THAT AT THAT POINT. THE TECH ALMOST PERMANENT RESTRAINING ORDER WOULD BE PUT ON YOU. RATHER THAN THE FACT I'M HAVING TO GO BACK TO COURT IN REQUESTING. SO THAT IS WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO ACHIEVE WITH THE AMENDMENTS. THANK YOU THANK YOU MANAGER AND A- CONSULTANT- PLEASE CORRECT A FIVE IF THERE WERE A I AM NOT A LAWYER HERE SENATOR WIENER IS A LAWYER SENATOR JACKSON'S LAWYER MY CONSULTANTS LAWYERS SO OF COURSE ICE I DESCRIBE THESE THINGS IN. COMMON VERNACULAR AND SOMETIMES CAN MAKE A- SO GO AHEAD CONSULTANT THERE'S A SUPER CERTAIN GROUP OF SEX OFFENDERS THAT HAVE LIFETIME PAROLE SO THIS WOULD THE AMENDMENT WOULD STRIKE UP THE CURRENT LANGUAGE IN THE BAT IN THE BILL AND INSTEAD. CHOIR IN THE CASES WHERE THE SEX OFFENDER AS LIFETIME PAROLE FOR THE PAROLE BOARD TO PUT THE RESTRAINING ORDER AS A CONDITION OF PAROLE. SO THERE'S WE'VE ALREADY SELECTED THE WORST OF THE WORST AND GIVEN THEM LIFETIME PAROLE. NO ONE NIGHT IN DESCRIBING NOW I. AS A PERSON WHO IS A- EXPERIENCE SEXUAL CRIME- AS THE VICTIM YOU DON'T EVER WANT TO MOST PEOPLE WE NEVER WANT TO EVER DO WITH THE PERPETRATOR AGAIN WE NEVER WANT TO HAVE TO GO TO COURT WE NEVER WANT TO DO ANYTHING IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE PERPETRATOR AGAIN. FOR LARGE HAVE TO BALANCE THE RIGHTS OF EVERYONE AND SO I IN NO WAY WANT TO DENY THE EXPERIENCE OF THE VICTIM WHO CALLED IN BUT IN TRYING TO. THREAD THE NEEDLE IN TERMS OF RESPECTING THE RIGHTS OF ALL CONCERNED IN CONSTRUCTING A LAW IT SEEMED LIKE IT. IT WITH WORKING WITH MY STAFF AND OTHERS IT WAS I FELT THE APPROPRIATE AMENDMENTS. NOW AND AGAIN I AM IN IN THE COMMON I'M ABOUT TO MAKE I DO NOT MEAN TO IMPLY IN ANY WAY THAT MS MENDEZ WHO SPOKE IS IN IT SHE SHE EXPERIENCE WHAT YOU EXPERIENCED. BUT IN WHAT SHE COMMUNICATED SHE INDICATED THAT THAT WAS THE FAMILY MEMBERS. OF HER PERPETRATOR. AND EVEN IF WE WERE TO PASS THE LAW AS PRESENTED TO US RIGHT NOW WITHOUT THE MINUTE. HE WOULD ONLY BE A RESTRAINING ORDER ON THE INDIVIDUAL ON THE PERPETRATOR AND NOT ON THE FAMILY MEMBERS SO IT WOULD NOT I MEAN IT IS HORRIBLE WHAT SHE EXPERIENCED AND NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO EXPERIENCE THAT. BUT THIS LAW WOULD NOT HAVE PREVENTED THOSE FAMILY MEMBERS FROM DOING WHATEVER THEY DID. NOW LET ME SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER ON THE- I'M CENTER JACKSON AND SENATOR WIENER YEAH I DIDN'T GET IT. I REMEMBER WAY BACK WHEN I WAS A YOUNG PROSECUTOR- YOU HAD- INDIVIDUALS WHO FOR WHATEVER REASON URINATED IN PUBLIC AND HAD TO REGISTER AS SEX OFFENDERS ALONG WITH PEOPLE WHO WERE TRUE. SEX OFFENDER SO I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT WE RECOGNIZED THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE- SOME DISTINCTION BETWEEN. THE OFFENSES THAT HAVE BEEN CATEGORIZED AS A SEX OFFENSE. REGISTRATION CRIMES- I THINK THE PROPOSAL THAT. YOU RECOMMEND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE BAD THE REALLY BAD PEOPLE. AND THE FACT THAT THEY WILL HAVE A LIFETIME THE PAROLE BOARDS OVER WHICH HAVE JURISDICTION OVER THEM POTENTIALLY FOR THE COURSE OF THEIR LIVES WE'LL BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT DECISION. I ALSO THINK WE NEED TO GIVE THE COURT SOME. DISCRETION IN HIS IS WELL IF A PERSON NEEDS TO COME IN FOR WHATEVER REASON AFTER A TEN YEAR PERIOD- TO RENEW A- RESTRAINING ORDER IF YOU WILL I THINK THAT THAT IS OF AS I UNDERSTAND ALREADY AVAILABLE. SO I GUESS MY QUESTION. IS IF I MAY MAN CHAIR TO THE AUTHOR IS WHY ARE YOU ONE WILLING TO ACCEPT. THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE PROPOSED BY- THE CHAIR AND BY THE COMMITTEE- IN ORDER TO. MAKE THIS I THINK WHAT WILL BE AS YOU SAY WE HAVE A NEED A WE% HAVE TO THREAD HERE WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT- IF YOU COULD RESPOND BECAUSE I AM INCLINED TO FOLLOW THE DIRECTION OF THE CHAIR. WHICH MEANS I WILL NOT BE VOTING FOR THIS AND I SUSPECT THERE ARE OTHERS WHO MAY. DO THE SAME- SO I'D LIKE TO PERHAPS HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHY YOU ARE UNWILLING TO TAKE THOSE AMENDMENTS. I JUST GO AHEAD SEND RINGTONE COMMANDCHECK. UP WE YOU KNOW. I DON'T DISAGREE WE DON'T DISAGREE WITH AT THE COMMENTS MADE HERE BY BY COMPARISON THE CONCERNS. ARE OUT WE DEFINITELY DON'T I DEFINITELY DON'T WANT TO- YOU KNOW HAVE IT APPLY. IN A BROADLY WAY BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT WE DON'T NARROWED SO MUCH THAT IT DOESN'T APPLY TO THE- TO OUR VICTIMS THAT WERE. THAT WERE FIGHTING ON BEHALF OF AND SO. THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS PRESENTED TO US- I MEAN WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH WHAT THE COMMITTEE- STAFF AND EVEN WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO MAKE THE NECESSARY AMENDMENTS TO MAKE THIS WORK- BUT WE DON'T. WE DON'T NECESSARILY BELIEVE THAT THE-AMENDMENTS. THAT WERE PROVIDED TO US WOULD FIT- DID BE TOO NARROW FOR OUR VICTIMS OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO PROTECT. MAY I ASK ONE POINT A CLASS CUNNINGHAM JACKSON MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE BILL DOESN'T NARROW EXISTING LAW. HL SIMPLY THE FINES AND IDENTIFIES THE BAD THE TRULY THE WORST OFFENDERS AND CREATES THE POTENTIAL FOR A LIFETIME- RESTRAINING ORDER AS A CONDITION OF PAROLE. SO IN IT DO YOU DISAGREE WITH ADAM I MISSED READING THE BILL. THROUGH THE CHAIR GO AHEAD AUTHOR. AT THE WHITE I AGREE WITH YOU BUT- BASED ON THE LANGUAGE THAT I HAVE I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT. IT PROTECTS THE VICTIMS THAT WERE LOOKING TO REPRESENT. OKAY THANK YOU. SENATOR WIENER. THANKS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I DID HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE AUTHOR- YESTERDAY- ABOUT THIS AND I WANNA JUST APPRECIATE THE WORK- THAT YOU'RE DOING I THINK YOU ARE YOU'RE TRYING TO HELP VICTIMS PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW TERRIBLY HARMS AND- THE YOU MIGHT MISS BUT THE WITNESS. ACCOUNT BEFORE I KNOW NO ONE EVER EVER HAVE TO EXPERIENCE AND- SOMEONE WHO WOULD DO THAT TO ANOTHER HUMAN BEING- SHOULD NOT SEE THE LIGHT VICTIMS NEED TO BE PROTECTED SO DODD. THIS ISN'T ABOUT. ON BAD IN TERMS OF DISCUSSION WE'RE HAVING TODAY- AS I MENTIONED TO YOU YESTERDAY WITH CHAIRS AMENDMENTS I WOULD BE. WILLING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL THE MANY AT THE TWO OR THREE WHEN WE- WHEN WE PASSED THE REFORM TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT WAS. THE CULMINATION OF YEARS AND YEARS OF WORK IT WAS IN A CONSTANT FAILURE FAILURE FAILURE AND WE FINALLY ASSEMBLED THE COALITION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT SUPPORT- TO UNDERSTAND SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY WAS A DISASTER IT STILL IS BECAUSE- TECHNICALLY DOESN'T GO INTO EFFECT THESE CHANGES UNTIL. THE END OF THIS YEAR TO COMPLETE USELESS DISASTER WITH ONE FOUR HUNDRED CALIFORNIANS ON SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY. FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE TO THE POINT WHERE LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITH IT IN TERMS OF IDENTIFYING WHO WERE THE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY. PRESCOTT WE HAVE X. FOR THE PEOPLE YOU'RE IN IT IN PUBLIC OR THE- YOU KNOW THE GUYS WHO HAD SEX IN A PARK IN NINETEEN SIXTY WHO STONE THE REGISTRY- AND THEN WE HAVE. STREAM AND OF THE PREDATORS WHO WERE TALK JUST HORRIFIC HUMAN BEINGS. THERE'S A MASSIVE SPECTRUM BETWEEN INCLUDING ANSWER TO. ON AND SO- IT SO WE CREATED THIS YEAR'S IT WASN'T PERFECT. IT'S STILL NOT. PERFECT BUT IT WAS WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO AND WE GOT HAT PASSED INTO LAW AND ARE GOING TO AFFECTS SOON- IF THIS WERE LIMITED TO TIER THREE. I WOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM SUPPORTING IT YOU KNOW THE CRIME TO TIER THREE ARE. JUST IT SUGGESTS THERE. COULD NOT AN ISSUE- BUT I THINK THE BREADTH OF THE BILL NOW IS A THIS IS A STEP TOO FAR FOR ME AS I EXPRESSED TO. I ESTAS APPRECIATE WHAT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO- CREDIT FOR DOING THAT AND I AND I THANK YOU FOR TRYING TO STEP UP TO THESE. VICTIMS BUT THIS IS JUST A IT'S A- IT'S A STEP OO FAR- FOR ME SO- I HOPE- RECONSIDER IF YOU DO THE BILL AGAIN. YOU KNOW- RECONSIDER- BUT THAT'S FINE I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY UNFORTUNATELY. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THE- ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. FROM MEMBERS. GREAT SEEING NINE A SENATOR HER DAUGHTER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES I JUST WANT TO AB YOU KNOW EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE TO THE CHAIR AND TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND OF COURSE IT IS A COMMITTEE STAFF OF FOR WORKING WITH MY TEAM AND MAKING SURE THAT WE TRY TO GET THE CIS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE AND- I NOTE THAT. THIS IS THIS IS JUST THE START OF A CONVERSATION AND I THINK ON THE SAME PAGE AND SO I KNOW THAT THAT- THAT IF IT DOESN'T GET THROUGH THE DAY THAT WE WILL CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE AND MAKE SURE THAT WE MAKE IT BETTER SO IT WORKS FOR ALL OF US AND SO I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT'S WHAT WE ALL WANT. SO THANK YOU. I AM. THANK YOU AND I THINK THE MOST OF THE MY COLLEAGUES IN THE DíAS WOULD YEAR THE MORNING TO. REJECT THOSE VICTIMS FROM HAVING TO. BASICALLY HAVE TO GO BACK TO COURT AGAIN AND AGAIN SINCE WE KNOW THAT ALREADY DEAR IS THE SEXUAL CRIMES JUST IN AN OF THEIR NATURE PEOPLE REPORT THEM LESS JUST BECAUSE OF THE NOT EVEN WANTING TO GO THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE OF HAVING TO- REPORT N. B. I MEAN THIS. THE WHETHER IT'S SHAME OR- WONDERING WHETHER YOU WOULD BE EVEN CONSIDERED CREDIBLE SO WE KNOW THEY'RE ALL THOSE ELEMENTS BUT IN AS WE'VE DISCUSSED IN. TRYING TO CRAFT ANY STATUTE WE HAVE TO BALANCE ALL THE RIGHTS- SO I AM. I THINK WE ARE. WE CERTAINLY TRIED OUR BEST TO COME UP WITH AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT WERE EXPRESSED BY YOUR ADVOCATES- IN YOUR BILL SPONSORED- BUT I CAN SEE NOW THAT IT DOESN'T QUITE DO WHAT YOU NEEDED TO DO BUT I THINK THE BILL SAY FIRST BEFORE AS RIGHT NOW IS FOR MYSELF TOO BROAD. AND SO I WILL BE NOT SUPPORT STAY OFF AND WITH THAT LET'S SEE IS THERE ANY. ANY MOTION ON THE BILL OR SHOULD WE CAN. THE RIGHT SO WE HAVE A MOTION AND- LET'S DO A ROLL CALL. MOTION IS THE PAST TWO APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER. MORE LOCK. BRADFORD JACKSON. MITCHELL. BURL HI I WIENER WIENER NOW VOTERS OF ONE ONE BILL FAILS. THE PHONE BILL FAILS OF. I'D I'D WE I DON'T THINK IN THIS YEAR WE WOULD- EVERY CONSIDERATION IS NOT REALLY AVAILABLE THIS YEAR IS THAT CORRECT THERE WOULD BE NO TIME TO HEAR THE BILL BRITT SO. OTHERWISE I WOULD BE HAPPY TO GRITTED BUT I DON'T THINK IN THIS CONTEXT WE SO ANYWAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND- WELCOME TO THE CONVERSATION TO THANK THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER. CORRECT. WE ARE GOING TO OUR NEXT BILL. SO WE WILL NOW HEAR SB ELEVEN NINETY SIX SENATOR UMBERG AND THAT IS ON PRICE GOUGING. AND I BELIEVE YOUR KEY WITNESSES IN SUPPORTER ON THE LINE BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PHONE FOR OTHER FOLKS IS PUT UP ON THE SCREEN JUST SO PEOPLE KNOW. SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE SAME WE CAN PROCEED TO- EXPEDITIOUSLY SENATOR UMBERG GO AHEAD PRESENT YOUR BILL OF THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- LET ME BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. ALSO I KNOW THE PRESENCE OF MOSES HERE IN COMMITTEE TODAY I'M SORRY THAT SENATOR MORLOCK. MORNING SENATOR. SO WHAT WHAT YOU HAVE. YEAH BUT MY PEOPLE GO. A MAN CHAIR MEMBERS- YEAH BEFORE YOU SB ELEVEN NINETY SIX- AS A RESULT IS EXPERIENCED DURING THE PANDEMIC THEY'VE BEEN INCREDIBLE STORIES OF OUR NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS AND OTHERS- STEPPING UP TO HELP EACH OTHER SADLY THERE ARE VERY FEW A VERY FEW IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE USE THIS PANDA LIKE THIS CRISIS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEIR NEIGHBORS. AND THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL AS YOU GOVERNOR'S ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT- DURING THE PERIOD OF EMERGENCY MAKES PRICE GOUGING IS BILLED AS THE FIGHT BY RAISING THE PRICE OF A GOOD. MORE THAN 10% OVER THE PREVIOUS PRODUCTS. THAT WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS THIS BILL CODIFIES THAT IT ALSO- PROVIDES. WHERE IS A BUSINESS HAS NOT BEEN SELLING A PARTICULAR GOOD BUT GETS IN THE BUSINESS FOR EXAMPLE SELLING HAND SANITIZER AND THEN- ENGAGES IN PRICE GOUGING THAT THEY ALSOMAY BE PUNISHED. ONE ASPECT OF THE BILL THAT IS ALSO NEW AND THAT'S THAT- IF ONE. UP PROFITS BY MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. THEN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY HAS THE DISCRETION TO CHARGE THIS IS EITHER MISDEMEANOR OR A FELONY. AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE- IF YOU ARE A LARGE pGOUGE. MISTER MEANER FOR A LARGE SCALE OPERATION IT IS REALLY JUST A PARKING TICKET. AND A FELONY WILL BOTH I THINK SEND A MESSAGE SHOULD THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY DECIDED TO CHOOSE IT AND ALSO. IT WILL BECAUSE- LARGER ENTITIES TO HAS SOME PAUSE. BEFORE THE ENGAGE IN PRICE GOUGING- WITH ME- OR ACTUALLY ON THE LINE- THERE ARE TWO WITNESSES- FIRST- LESLIE YOUNG ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY CONSUMER AND ENVIRONMENTAL FRAUDS UNIT. AT THE ORANGE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN TOM. PAPA GEORGE HEAD OF THE CONSUMER PROTECTION UNIT SAN DIEGO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE I SHOULD ALSO NOTE MATTER MAN SURE THAT THE YEARS STAFF HAS WORKED VERY. ON THE CIVIC STYLE. AND DONE SOME VERY GOOD WORK WITH US- APPRECIATE THAT. THANK BY MIKE THANK YOU LET'S SEE HERE FOR YOUR pWITNESSES AND- BUT I WILL SAY THEIR NAME SO THEY CAN GO IN ORDER. THE FIRST- MISS LESLEE YOUNG A GREAT AND THEN THOMAS PAPA GEORGE K. GREAT AND YOU HAVE TOTAL THREE MINUTES GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS LESLIE YOUNG AND I AM THE ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN CHARGE OF THE CONSUMER FRAUD UNIT AT THE ORANGE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. ON BEHALF OF ORANGE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY TODD THAT SIR I WOULD LIKE TO THANK SENATOR- BURKE FOR CARRYING THIS BILL AND IT IS OUR HONOR TO CO SPONSOR THIS LEGISLATION. WITH THE DANTE AGO DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. IN EARLY MARCH WE SET UP A HOTLINE FOR THE CITIZENS OF ORANGE COUNTY TO REPORT INCIDENTS OF PRICE GOUGING. IN THE FIRST TWO MONTHS WE RECEIVED OVER THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY CALL. WE LEARNED QUICKLY THAT THE MAJORITY OF ORANGE COUNTY BUSINESS. CONTACTED OR BETTER THAN THAT ONE TO FOLLOW THE LAW AND VOLUNTARILY PROVIDED OUR INVESTIGATORS WITH THE- WE NEEDED. TO DETERMINE IF PRICE GOUGING HAD OCCURRED BUT IN A SMALL MINORITY OF CASES WE ENCOUNTERED UNCOOPERATIVE BUSINESSES THAT WERE SELLING ESSENTIAL ITEMS LIKE THEY NOW. YEAH OUTSIDE THE NOT OLD PRIOR TO THE EMERGING DECLARATION. SHE. THESE ARE NOT GOOD ACTORS WHO MADE IT. AND WANTED TO. ONE TWO ARE WILLINGLY. OFF THE OF A- MAKING PRICE GOUGING AWAY BLUR THAT CAN BE A FELONY WHEN THE UNLAWFUL PROFIT IS GREATER THAN TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IS A FAIR WAY TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS A SUFFICIENT DISINCENTIVES TO THE LARGEST PRICE GOUGING SCHEME. WHILE CONTINUING TO TREAT THE SMALL RETAILERS WITH THE LENIENCY THEY DESERVE WE URGE AND I'D VOTE ON THIS BILL AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS MR PAPAGEORGIOU. YES GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS TOM PAPA GEORGE WITH THE SAN DIEGO DA'S OFFICE. I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT I HELPED ASSEMBLY MEMBER RICHARD KATZ DRAFTS THE ORIGINAL PENAL CODE SECTION THREE NINETY SIX. AFTER THE SAN FERNANDO EARTHQUAKE IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR AND OVER THE YEARS IT'S BEEN A VALUABLE TOOL TO HELP US. CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS FROM PRICE GOUGING. BUT THE CURRENT EMERGENCY SHOWS THAT WE NEED TO UPDATE THE LAW. THIS BILL PROVIDES TWO IMPORTANT CLARIFICATIONS IT CLARIFIES THAT THE PRICE GOUGING LAW APPLIES TO. ALL TO CLEAR EMERGENCY SITUATIONS INCLUDING PANDEMICS AND ALSO APPLIES THE LAW EQUALLY TO ALL SELLERS ONLINE SELLERS AS WELL AS BRICK AND MORTAR RETAILERS. THE CURRENT LAW ONLY COVERS BUSINESSES THAT SOLD BEFORE AN EMERGENCY AND THAT WAS THE CONCERN BACK IN NINETY FOUR EXTENDS THE LAW TO COVER NEW SELLERS AS WELL. SO THAT IT FLIES FAIRLY TO ALL BUSINESSES IN THE MARKETPLACE. A LARGE SCALE PRICE GUIDE YOU CAN BE VERY SERIOUS YOU CAN EVEN THREATEN HEALTH AND SAFETY. SUCH AS A CASE WERE INVESTIGATING PRESENTLY IN NINETY FIVE MASKS BEING SOLD FOR TEN TIMES THEIR COST. AS THE SENATORS POINT OUT THAT MISDEMEANORS SOMETIMES DON'T TO ADEQUATELY DETER LARGER BUSINESSES. SO THIS BILL PROVIDES FOR AN ALTERNATE FELONY MISDEMEANOR BUT WITH A VERY IMPORTANT SAFEGUARD. THE FELONY IS ONLY AVAILABLE IN CASES OF PRICE GOUGING SALES OF TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE. SO THE FAMILY CAN ONLY BE USED FOR THE MOST SERIOUS CASES WE THINK THAT'S A FAIR AND APPROPRIATE APPROACH I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR ATTENTION THIS MORNING.

THRESHOLD BECAUSE IT DIDN'T THE AGGREGATE AND THIS DOES NOT DEAL WITH THE IDEA THAT THE BILL IS TO GO AFTER. CORPORATION THE LARGE BUSINESSES. FOR HOME A MISDEMEANOR MAY MEAN NOTHING BUT THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT LANGUAGE DOES ALLOW FOR THE AGGREGATE AND IT STILL LEAVES THE DOOR OPEN. TO JUDGE MALL BUSINESSES AND THE POOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU- MR ABI ON IF YOU'RE STILL ON THE LINE YOU CAN EXPLAIN WHAT IT IS THAT. BRIEFLY MODERATOR YOU CAN OF RECOGNIZE MISTRAL PEONIES. WE STILL HAVE THIRTY SECONDS OVER THREE MINUTES.

AND LINE THIRTEEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIR AND AGAIN JUST VERY QUICKLY FOR ALL COMMODITY ENTITIES BASED SOME OF THE INTERNATIONAL NATIONAL AND OBVIOUSLY THE STATE MARKETS. AND THE UNDERLYING BILL DOES NOT RECOGNIZE. IF PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ESPECIALLY IN SOMETHING LIKE A PANDEMIC WHERE THE INTERNATIONAL OR INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. BUT TO CONCLUDE THE PRINTED THE BIG CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE MAY SHIFTING GO UP MORE THAN TEN PERCENT. AND THEN- WE WOULD BE IN VIOLATION OF THIS BILL AS A TERRIBLE LAWS IT'S WRITTEN AND THEN OBVIOUSLY FELONY NOW BUT THE BILL SO WE'D LIKE TO WE PROVIDE SOME SOME- AMENDMENTS TO THE TO THE OFFICER THERE. WERE LOOKED AS TOO BROAD SO WE'RE WORKING ON THAT. BOAT BUT THIS IS THE REAL ISSUE THAT ENTITIES THAT ARE SO INUNDATED TIONAL INTERNATIONAL REMARK. MAY TO BE DEL WITH DIFFERENTLY JUST BECAUSE IT WOULD CREATE A DISINCENTIVE TO SELL INTO THE CALIFORNIA- INTO THE EMERGENCY AREA. IF YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE ENTITIES AND FRANKLY WE DON'T WANT THAT YOU WANT PRODUCT MOVING INTO THE- EMERGENCY AREAS SO- WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD AND WE HAVE SPOKEN OF THE- THE STAFF WILL CONTINUE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT. LOS TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY JUST REGULAR PUBLIC OR NOT REGULAR PLUG PEOPLE JUST PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT ARTIFICIAL- OPPONENTS ARE TRAINERS WHO JUST WANT TO SAY THEIR NAME AFFILIATION AND WEIGH IN MODERATOR ALLOW THEM AT THE RISE WILL GO TO THE DíAS NEVER DISCUSSION. AND THANK YOU IF YOU'D LIKE TO WEIGH IN PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO TO GET YOUR LINE NUMBER. ONCE AGAIN IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO WAY N. PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO TO RECEIVE YOUR LINE NUMBER. AND ONE MOMENT PLEASE. ILLINOIS ACTIVITY NOW ONCE AGAIN IT TO ONE AND THEN ZERO IF YOU'D LIKE TO WEIGH IN. AND I'M SHOWING NO RESPONSE AT THIS TIME. ALRIGHT SO WE WILL TURN TO THE DíAS NOW FOR DISCUSSION SENATOR WIENER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD PRICE GOUGING IS. IT'S A REAL ISSUE AND- YOU KNOW I COMMEND YOU FOR- FOR DRESSING WITH THIS BILL. TIME AS I MENTIONED YOU WHEN WE SPOKE THIS MORNING- I HAVE A CONCERN WITH ONE SPECIFIC ASPECT OF THE BILL. AND THAT IS A PROVISION THAT IF YOU HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY SOLD AN ITEM SO IT'S A NEW ITEM THAT YOU'RE SELLING- YOU CAN NOT MARKET UP MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT. BASED ON WHAT YOU PAID FOR IT- AND THIS COULD BE A SITUATION WHERE AS A YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY IT'S DESIGNED FOR SITUATION WERE. A BUSINESS DESIGNS DECIDES YOU KNOW SOMEONE STARTS ON MASKS AND- NO GOING TO PAY FIFTY CENTS FIFTY CENTS FOR THEM AND S LLARS OR- YOU KNOW BUT IT ALSO APPLIES IF THE STORE- FOR EXAMPLE SIGNED CLEANING PRODUCTS THEY SOLD FOR A LONG TIME BUT NOW. BECAUSE OF SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES WHATEVER THEIR SHIFT TO A NEW BROWN. THEN BE PRECLUDED FROM MARKING THAT OUT MORE THAN FIFTY FOR. GAR LISTS OF WHAT THEY- CHARGE FOR THE PREVIOUS. BRAND TODAY CAN NO LONGER ACCESS. AND SO IT'S A VERY BLUNT INSTRUMENT- AND I KNOW THAT I THINK THIS. I ASSUME THIS IS COMING FROM THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT ALSO. APPLY THE 50% BUT I EVEN BEFORE THIS BILL IS ON MY RADAR ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER- I GOT OUT REACH FROM HARDWARE STORES- IN MY DISTRICT THAT I KNOW THAT. I GUESS THERE MAY BE NO CALIFORNIA HARDWARE ASSOCIATION WE GOT THE LETTER FROM THE NATIONAL. THE NORTH AMERICAN RETAIL HARDWARE ASSOCIATION INDIANAPOLIS THEIR OFFICES AND TESTIFIED TODAY THEY SENT A LETTER. CERTAINLY IN THE PROCESS OF SO BE IT I GUESS THE HARVESTERS MAYBE AREN'T AS ORGANIZED IN CALIFORNIA OR DON'T HAVE A LOBBYIST- AND SO THIS HAS AND AS- AS PART OF THE CONVERSATION BUT- THE CONCERN IS THAT FOR EXAMPLE IF A HARDWARE STORE. HAS TO SHIFT TO A NEW. CLEANING PRODUCT. AND LET'S SAY THEY'RE PAYING. A DOLLAR FIFTY FOR THAT CLEANING PRODUCT. BAY WOULD BE PRECLUDED FOM CHARGING MORE THAN TWO DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS FOR IT. SO TWO DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS WILL BE CONSIDER PRICE GOUGING EVEN THOUGH I THINK MOST PEOPLE LOOKING AT THAT. WOULD SAY THAT'S NOT PRICE HOUSING- AND THE CHALLENGES THAT IN TERMS OF JUST COVERING THEIR OWN COSTS. OF STAFF OF. OVERHEAD IT CETERA ETCETERA- ACCORDING TO A- HARDWARE STORE IN OUR MY DISTRICT TO I'VE SPOKEN TO THE WHITE OF PHENOMENAL BUSINESS LONG TIME HUNDRED YEAR OLD FAMILY BUSINESS. WHO I TRUST AND THAT IS A GOOD ACTOR. THEY'RE THEY'RE GONNA LOSE MONEY- ON THESE- PRODUCTS. AND SO THAT IS A REAL CONCERN- FOR ME I'VE BEEN FIFTY PERCENT- EVEN THOUGH IT SOUNDS GOOD WHEN YOU READ IT BECAUSE- YOU KNOW AND THEN THE OTHER CONTACTS WERE ALREADY OFFERING- NOT BEING ABLE TO RAISE MORE THAN TEN PERCENT. THAT MAKES ALL THE SENSE SENSE IN THE WORLD ALREADY AS A BUSINESS IT'S A PRICE. AND IF YOU'RE NOW RAISING IT DURING AN EMERGENCY MORE THAN 10% WE KNOW WHY YOU'RE DOINGTHAT. BUT THE 50% I THINK IS NOT VALID. AND HI MARTY DESIRE WOULD BE FOR THAT TO COME OUT OF THE BILL- WE'VE CONVEYED TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THAT WE- THINK IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE ON THE EXECUTIVE BOARD- BUT IT'S- AN ACTIVITY WITH THAT. FIFTY I'M- YOU KNOW GOING. HOLD OFF ON THE BILL. I'D LIKE TO GO TO VOTE THE FLOW. THE RICHEST TALK THAT ISSUE A LITTLE BIT MANAGER WAS LIKE TO BE TO RESPOND MY CLOTHES OR YOU MAY RESPOND NOW SENATOR AMBER ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER AND YES YOU'RE RIGHT WE HAD THE CONVERSATION AND I THINK YOU THERE HAVE BEEN A COUPLE VALID POINTS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED HERE. ONE IS THAT- THE BILL DOES NOT- TAKE INTO. ITS CALCULATION. THE FIXED COSTS. FOR THE HIGHER LABOR COSTS SO FOR EXAMPLE SAN FRANCISCO- WHERE THE FIXED COSTS ARE PROBABLY HIGHER THAN OTHER PLACES STATE LABOR MAY BE HIGHER THAN OTHER PLACES THE STATE. THAT WE WILL WORK WITH YOU AND OTHERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WERE FIXED COSTS IN LABOR COSTS AND OTHER COSTS. BASICALLY DON'T INCREASE THE PROFIT THAT'S OR AFTER WERE AFTER FOLKS WHO ALSO GET THE FACEMASK BUSINESS AND AS YOU POINT OUT. BY FACE MASK FOR FIFTY CENTS IS ALL FOR TWENTY DOLLARS. AND SO- WILL WORK ON THE LANGUAGE TO SEE IF WE CAN'T- A CRAFTED SUCH A IT DRESSES THAT ISSUE OTHER PLACES IN THE BILL. YOU TALK ABOUT 10% INCREASE DUE. OF FOCUS ON OTHER COST SIGHS COST OF ACQUISITION OF THE PARTICULAR PRODUCT. THAT'S THAT'S ITEM ONE AND WILL CONTINUE WORK ON THAT I HAD TO IS WITH RESPECT TO CALL BODIES SUCH AS WE EAT- THE BILL- FOCUSES ON. CONCERT PERCHED SO I SUPPOSE THAT THE CONSUMER WHICH IS TO PURCHASE A BUSHEL WHEAT. AND THE FROM OF THE A SUPPLIER WE WILL ALSO ON TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT SOMEHOW IF THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET INCREASES THE PRICE OF WHEAT OR CORN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND YOU WANT TO BUY A BUSHEL CORN THAT THAT THE SUPPLIER IF THEY'RE SELLING IT AT THE MARKET RATE WILL BE A POTENTIALLY TACT- BUT AND I AND I ALSO GET THAT THIS IS LITTLE. CONSOLATION BUT BUT DISTRICT ATTORNEYS DO HAVE DISCRETION SO MY EXPECTATION IS A DISTRICT ATTORNEY IS NOT GOING TO CHARGE SOMEONE WHO BUYS A BUSHEL OF WHEAT- AT MARKET PRICE FOR- OR EXCUSE ME WHO SELLS BUSHEL WHEAT AT MARKET PRICE OF WITH PRICE GOUGING BUT THANK YOU EIGHT- IF I MIGHT JUST GO AHEAD YES SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT SO I'M GOING TO I'M GOING TO I'M NOT FOR THE BILL TODAY- I'LL STAY OFF I IN MY DESIRES TO VOTE FOR ON THE FLOOR OF MY STAFFERS SO TO YOUR STAFF MAYBE ONE GAME SOME OF THE LOCAL HARDWARE STORES TALK ABOUT IT I APPRECIATE YOUR OPEN THIS. THE HOPE IN THE FUTURE BUT- THE POINT HARPER SORT BE. MAYBE OR A LITTLE MORE. AND GET INVOLVED EARLY BECAUSE IN FAIRNESS TO. THIS WAS. AT THE LAST MINUTE- BINATIONAL ORGANIZATION SO WE'LL WORK ON THAT AS WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR WE HAVE. A CENTER MORE LIKE IN THE IN A SENATOR JACKSON'S GOOD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I. JUST WANTED MAYBE INDULGE ME AND JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT IF ANYBODY'S WATCHING WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY. DEALING WITH HERE SPLINE DEMAND IS KEY FUNDAMENTAL ASPECT OF THE ECONOMY SO WILL WANT TO MAKE SURE WE DEFINE PRICE GOUGING PROPERLY AND IN ORDER FREE MARKET PRINCIPLES WE WORSE WE'RE SITTING UNDERNEATH. INCREDIBLE MOSAIC AND DURING THE GOLD RUSH. YOU PAPER THE AYE PRICES FOR A EXISTS IN FOODSTUFFS IN THE RETAILERS ARE ACTUALLY THE REAL MONEY MAKERS- LELAND STANFORD. YOU KNOW THAT JUST ASSIST SUCCESS STORY BECAUSE HE COULD CHARGE HIGH PRICES LIKE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE REALLY CLEAR THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. A EITHER BY THE GOVERNOR OR BY THE PRESENT UNITED STATES- BECAUSE THERE ARE RETAILERS THAT- RECENTLY WITH A P. S. P. S. WHEN THE POWER SHORTAGE OR POWER SHUT OFF THE DAY HAD TO GIVE THEIR FOOD AWAY AND FREEZERS WRITER IS LIKE THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE SO I'M I'M JUST CURIOUS BUT A COUPLE THINGS ONE IS THE EFFICACY OF. 10% AND A YOU'RE SO I'M JUST COULD COULD JUST HELP ME OUT AND I'M GLAD YOU GOT TO YOU HAD THE MISTER PAPA GEORGE ON TH LINE AND HE SEEMS LIKE HE USED STATED HE WAS THERE FOR THE ORIGINAL OUTSIDE I I'D LIKE JUST FOR YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ALL UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT PRICE GOUGING AND WHAT IT IS AND- WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO. QUANTIFY BUT LET ME SEE IF I CAN MANAGER IF I MIGHT RESPOND AND LET ME SAN DIEGO OUT. I CAN RESPOND THAT MR PAPA GEORGE CAN SUPPLEMENT CORRECT ME THAT BE FINE AS WELL. SO YOU'RE YOU'RE CRACKS AND MORE LIKE WE'RE ONLY TALKING ABOUT EMERGENCY. IN THE LAWS OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND DON'T WORK. THE WAY IT SHOULD. WITH THE THEY SHOULD- DURING AN EMERGENCY- IT IT IS TO PROTECT SO FOR EXAMPLE IF WE HAVE AN EARTHQUAKE AND THERE'S AN AREA THAT IS IN. NEED OF FOOD OR OTHER KINDS OF. OF PRODUCTS- IT IS BOTH. UNFAIR AND IMMORAL TO COME IN AND MY VIEW. AND CHARGE THOSE WHO ARE. AFFECTED EXORBITANT PRICES WERE IN ESSENCE YOU'RE BENEFITING YOUR PROP FUNDING FOR THEIR- UP THIS FOR. SO ONLY EMERGENCIES DOES BY NUMBER TWO THE TEMPERS OF AS THINK SO WINNER PER OUT IT IT IS DRY OF FROM THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER BUT IT'S 10% IT'S NOT 10% ABOVE YOUR COST IT'S 10% ABOVE WHAT YOU WERE CHARGING BEFORE SO THAT YOU KNOW YOU THAT I SUPPOSE YOU CAN INCREASE YOUR PRICES 9% AND BE BE IN GOOD SHAPE. OF THAT'S OF IT'S A FAIR TO FOR MARK UP IT'S A FAIR PROFIT DOING PENSIVE EMERGENCY- THE NOTHING REALLY MAGICAL ABOUT 10% COULD BE 11% COULD BE 9% BUT IT IT'S WHAT WE THOUGHT WOULD BE SORT OF A FAIR OF FAIR. IT'S AN IT IF YOU SO FOR LET'S SAY YOU'RE SELLING MEAT. AND THE COST TO YOU OF MEAT HAS INCREASED AND YOU HAVE TO INCREASE YOUR CALL YOUR YOUR PRICE TO CONSUMERS. YOU'RE NOT IN YOU'RE YOU'RE ONLY IN VIOLATION WHERE. BASICALLY YOUR COSTS AND TO SENATOR WINNERS POINT WILL WILL TRY TO PUT IN SIX COSTS AS WELL AS LABOR COSTS- NOT INCREASE IN IN YOUR JUST BENEFITING BASICALLY FROM THE FROM THE EMERGENCY. OF MR PAPA GEORGE SAY THE ONE THAT. THROUGH CHIRLA GRANTED IF YOU WANT TO ADD. FLEA MODERATOR IF MISTER POPPE COURT GEORGE IS STILL ON THE LINE HE CAN BRIEFLY RESPOND IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CAN CAN YOU HEAR ME AT THIS POINT YES. WE CAN YOU PLEASE CONTINUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU THE CENTER MARK AND SENATOR WE ARE THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF CONCERNS THAT WE VERY MUCH ARE WILLING TO WORK WITH. IT WAS THE SENATOR STE A STAFF AND ORANGE COUNTY AND OUR SANITY IS OFFICE AND I BELIEVE WE CAN RESOLVE BOTH OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED. FIRST AN EXPLANATION OF HOW THE- RULE WORKS FOR EXISTING SELLERS BECAUSE I THINK IT. CAN RESOLVE SEVERAL THESE CONCERNS. FOR AN EXISTING SELLER SELLER PRIOR TO THE EMERGENCY. THE CURRENT LAW. FOR ME IT'S NOT ONLY THE 10% INCREASE THAT'S ACTUALLY EIGHTY AT THE END OF THE- THE ARITHMETIC HERE THE CURRENT LAW ALLOWS AN EXISTING BUSINESS. TO INCREASE ITS PRICE. TO COVER ANY INCREASED COSTS MATERIAL OF THE LABOR AND THE LIKE. IT ALLOWS THE BUSINESS TO ADD ITS CURRENT PROFIT MARGIN. ON TOP OF THOSE CHANGED COSTS THEN ALLOWS AN ADDITIONAL 10% ABOVE THAT SOME SOME OF THE INCREASED COSTS PLUS THEIR TRADITIONAL MARKUP SO CENTER WE'RE AM VERY CONSCIOUS OF THE CONCERN THAT YOU EXPRESSED AND I'M CONFIDENT WE CAN WORK OUT LANGUAGE TO MAKE THESE PRINCIPLES APPLY BOTH THE NEW SELLERS. CAN TO PRIOR SELLERS BUT BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS- FOR EXISTING BUSINESSES THEY ARE PROTECTED THEY CAN INCREASE THEIR PRICES TO COVER INCREASED COSTS THEY CAN APPLY THEIR TRADITIONAL PROFIT MARGIN. AND EVEN 10% BEYOND THAT SO THERE'S PLENTY OF SEATING AT IN MY JUDGMENT DAN TO PROTECT EXISTING SELLERS AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN DO THE SAME KIND OF THING FOR NEW SELLERS WE CHOSE THE GOVERNOR'S- 50% ABOVE OSTS- FORMULA BUT WE CAN ABSOLUTELY INCORPORATE- THE ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT I JUST DESCRIBED SO WE CAN. HAVE BOTH EXISTING SELLERS NEW SO. EVERY ADEQUATELY MAKING A REASONABLE PROCESS BUT JUST NOT GOUGING THE ONE DOLLAR GAG MASKS BEING SOLD FOR TEN. THANK YOU MENTION. PHONE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IN THE CENTER MORE LIKE I BEFORE. YOU YOUR OF COMPLETED CENTER WIENER BEFORE I GO BACK TO SENATOR JACKSON HAD A COMMENT AND THEN I CAN RETURN SO I A I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL- GIVEN THE NATURE OF THIS YEAR- AND OBVIOUSLY THERE'S STILL MORE WORK TO BE DONE. I FIND PRODUCT PRICE COUNTERS TO BE AMONG THE LOWEST OF THE LOW- THIS ISN'T A QUESTION OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND THIS IS NOT A QUESTION OF CHOICE. SUPPLY AND DEMAND I THINK AGAIN A PROPERLY APPLIES WHEN PEOPLE HAVE A CHOICE. IN A PANDEMIC OR IN AN EMERGENCY SUCH AS WHAT YOUR BILL TALKS ABOUT PEOPLE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE. AND THE FACT THAT OTHERS WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE. OF PEOPLE'S MISFORTUNE IN THIS FASHION. IS REALLY OFFENSIVE TO ME SO I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE AND I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE AND I THINK. ANY ANYBODY AND EVERYBODY SUFFERS- IT ISN'T JUST THE POOR ALTHOUGH I SUSPECT THE POOR SUFFER MORE THAN MOST IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES THEY HAVE NO CHOICE WHETHER OR NOT TO BUY. A PRODUCT AND AN OUTRAGEOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT- SO I SEE THIS AS A AS- A VERY IMPORTANT- STATEMENT AND POLICY IN MORAL POSITION TO TAKE- TO DISCOURAGE THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR. IN THE MOST APPROPRIATE AND SIGNIFICANT WAY WE CAN AND SO MY QUESTION IS THIS. I'M ASSUMING MOST OF THESE. COMPANIES THAT DO THIS KIND OF A CHART DID CHARGE EXCESSIVELY. OUR CORPORATIONS SAID THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO OUT AND BUY IN BULK AND THEN CHARGE AND AN OUTRAGEOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY WHETHER WE'RE TALKING MASKS AS AN EXAMPLE. CRIMINAL PROCEEDING SO GENERALLY- YOU CAN'T PUT A CORPORATION IN JAIL. UNFORTUNATELY DOES THIS. LEGISLATION ALLOW FOR THE PIERCING OF THE CORPORATE VEIL OF THE CORPORATE VEIL SO THAT THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE THE CEOS OF THE UPPER MANAGEMENT THE PEOPLE MAKING THESE DECISIONS WILL BE PERSONALLY LIABLE AND SUBJECT TO INCARCERATION OF NOT THAT WE'RE GOING TO PUT A WHOLE LOT OF MISDEMEANOR IN- IN JAIL BUT IF THESE WERE CHARGED IS AS FELONIES WOULD WE BE ABLE TO THEN TAKE AND- CHARGER THESE. INDIVIDUALS ARE FOR THE BEHAVIOR OF THEIR COMPANIES SO THAT THEY WOULD THEN HAVE MORE TO LOSE THAN PERHAPS SOME SMALL AMOUNT OF PROFIT FOR THE COMPANY THAT THEY WOULD BE INDIVIDUALLY LIABLE. BUT I HAD SENATOR UMBERG AMIR SPINE THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATE JACKSON. THIS DOES NOT CHANGE THE LAW IN TERMS OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR CORPORATE ACTS SO IT WOULD BE. ANALOGOUS TO THE ENRON SITUATION SO YOU YOU CAN CHARGE BOTH THE CORPORATION AS WELL AS THE INDIVIDUAL IF YOU CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL. MET THE CRITERIA FOR PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR EXAMPLE THEY WERE KNOWING. AND A DATE THEY WERE BOTH KNOWING AND HAD MADE THE DECISION TO FOR EXAMPLE INCREASE PRICES SO. WELL THIS BILL DOESN'T DOESN'T CHANGE THE LAW INDIVIDUALS COULD BE SUBJECT TO IT EVEN IF IT'S- THEIR ACTING THROUGH A CORPORATION. THAT MAKES SENSE THE CENTER IS A I THINK SO BUT I. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THAT PEOPLE NOT BE ABLE TO HIDE BEHIND THAT CORPORATE FAIL WHEN THEY CONDUCT THEMSELVES IN THIS FASHION THE FACT THAT WE KNOW THAT WE LOST SOME OF OUR HEALTH CARE WORKERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS BECAUSE THEY THE OF THE UNAVAILABILITY OF THESE MASS IN THE DESERT. DECISIONS MADE TO CHARGE MORE TO MAKE MONEY. A IS TO EXERCISE GREED IN THE OF THE WORST ORDER. DURING A TIME WHEN WE ARE ALL. IT AT RISK AND ARE ALL SUFFERING IN SOME FORM OR ANOTHER FROM THE SUCH AS TO WHY I HOPE THAT THAT IS PART OF THIS AND- AGAIN- WITH YOUR COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS BILL I RECOGNIZE OUR CONCERNS IN THEIR LEGITIMATE. I WILL SUPPORT IT SO THAT THE PROCESS CAN CONTINUE AT WITH THAT OF COURSE SUBJECT TO THE DECISION ON THE FLOOR BUT I BUT I DO THANK YOU FOR BRING THIS SITE I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW INFURIATING I FEEL. WHEN I SEE THE CURRENT ASK PRICE GOUGING WHETHER IT'S FOR WIPES- NOW CHARGING TEN TIMES THE COST FOR WIPE SO THAT WE CAN TRY TO PROTECT OUR OUR HEALTH AND THE HEALTH OF OUR- FAMILIES AND OUR COMMUNITY. THE NOTION THAT WE WILL ALLOW THE TO OUR UNWILLING TO- TAKE SOME KIND OF- RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE- THE GENERAL WELL BEING- I SHOULD. FIND IT TO BE JUST ACCEPTABLE THANK YOU. CENTER OR DID YOU HAVE A GO AHEAD. YEAH THANK YOU I THINK EVERYONE AGREES HERE. PRICE GOUGING A STRONG COUPLE CONCERNS I HAVE THAT I THAT I LIKE TO ASK- IS CURRENT LAW I UNDERSTAND SAYS THAT- THINGS WILL BE RESTATED WITHIN THIRTY DAYS BUT THERE'S NO TIME FRAME ON YOUR BILL. AND THEN AM I RIGHT THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR WOULD DECIDE WHAT AN EMERGENCY IS AND HOW LONG THE TIME FRAMES TO GO. IT IT IT IS TRUE IT'S DURING THE PENDENCY RUMORED SURPLUS THIRTY DAYS SO AS IS THE CLERK BY THE GOVERNOR THAT THAT'S CORRECT. SO THERE THERE'S NOT SO. IT IS. DISCRETIONARY FOR EXAMPLE ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNOR IS THE HOW LONG THAT EMERGENCY. SHOULD STILL BE IMPACTING CALIFORNIA HAD A BAD GOVERNOR NOT THAT OUR GOVERNOR IS NOW WE GOT A BAD GOVERNOR MY SIDE OUT. THEY COULD USE THAT TO WEAPONIZE BUSINESSES CUT NAY. THEY COULD- I'LL I WOULD HOPE THAT THE- IF WE HAVE A BAD GOVERNOR WE WOULD NOT HAVE A BAD LEGISLATURE AND THAT THAT THEY COULD ACT. TO SEIZE THE EMERGENCY. I APPRECIATE THAT YOU HOPE APPLE WOULDN'T BE BETTER TO CLEARLY STATED IN YOUR BILL. BUT TO STATE THE LEGISLATURE COULD OVERRIDE THE GOVERNOR NO TO STATE THAT THERE'D BE A TIME FRAME ON THESE THINGS. IN THE CURRENT EXACTLY YOU KNOW SPECIFICATIONS ON THE TYPES OF EMERGENCIES. SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE A GOVERNOR THAT. AND RECLAIM SOME SUBMERGENCE SEE ONE IT'S REALLY NOT BELT BUT I THINK THAT. I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN OF. THE THERE IS A LAW THAT DEFINES WHEN AN EMERGENCY COULD BE DECLARED IN AND I RECALL CORRECTLY UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS IT CAN CONTINUE THIS BILL DOESN'T. THE ONLY AS MY UNDERSTANDING YOU KNOW MY DAUGHTER AND WE CAN ASK THE CONSULTANT TO CORRECT IF EITHER OF US ARE MY UNDERSTANDING IS STATUTE WHICH DEFINES WHAT CAN BE A STATE OF EMERGENCY IN THE ONLY. THING THAT THIS BILL DOES RELATIONSHIP TO THAT IS ADD PANDEMIC BECAUSE PANDEMIC WAS NOT IN THE ORIGINAL STATUTE. AND THE ADDITIONAL- ACTION THAT THIS BILL IS DOING IS BECAUSE THE BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL PRICE GOUGING STATUTE IS ONLY OP. THE TIMES OF EMERGENCY. THIS IS MODIFYING THE PRICE GOUGING STATUTE TO- WITH THE IN WITH HIS ACCEPTING OF THE AMENDMENTS TO. ALLOW IT TO BE A WAFFLER. AND AS I INDICATED PREVIOUSLY ADDING PANDEMIC AS A CATEGORY OF EMERGENCY. DID AYE ASK ACCURATELY PORTRAY THAT. THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT KIT IS NODDING SHE CAN ACTUALLY SPEAK INTO THE MIKE. YES THAT'S A CORRECT SUMMARY OKAY IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE DEFINITION OR HOW YOU DECLARE. A STATE THAT'S WHAT A STATE OF EMERGENCY YEARS OR HOW THAT IN THE STATE OF EMERGENCY ITSELF WHILE IN THE GOVERNOR THE CLERK IT. YOUR THE GOVERNOR AND HAVE BUT IN EIGHT ANY IN THE DECLARATION OF A DOES NOT HAVE TO PUT AN END DATE ON IT YOU'RE RIGHT. BUT IT- SO I SUPPOSE IN FOR THE CIRCUMSTANCE YOU'RE DESCRIBING. THERE COULD BE A GOVERNOR WHO DECLARE STATE EMERGENCY AND NEVER LEFT SET- SO THAT THAT'S WHERE THERE COULD BE. LET'S SEE- YOUR CONCERN WOULD MIGHT APPLY BUT I DON'T WELL WE CAN NEVER YOU DON'T KNOW SO ANYWAY AN AUTHOR I DON'T KNOW IF YOU. WELL I THINK THAT ONE AT ALL THE ONLY CHECK WELL I DON'T OF THE ONLY CHECK BUT EIGHT CHECK ON A GOVERNOR WHO DECIDES THAT THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A STATE OF EMERGENCY IN PERPETUITY. IS LEGISLATURE ENACTED LEGISLATION THAT ENDS THE STATE OF EMERGENCY. SO IF WE HAVE A LEGISLATURE AND WE HAVE A GOVERNOR. THAT BOTH ACT BASICALLY DO EFFECT PRICE CONTROLS FOR EVER. I DON'T I SUPPOSE INITIATIVE IS THE NEXT NEXT FALL BACK BUT. CENTER RURAL YOU MAY CONTINUE A FEW. OUR. I THINK A WHOLE LOT VOTING ON THIS UNTIL. THE PROPER LANGUAGES INSERTED IN BILL I THANK YOU CENTER. RIGHT ARMS D. SO LET ME- MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS OH SORRY SENATOR MORE LIKE- IT JUST A QUICK QUESTION- ANTICIPATING WHAT WHAT I MAY BE ASKED BY CONSTITUENTS AND- SO. WE'RE KEEPING THIS PRETTY CONTEMPORARY WITH FACE MASKS AND- SWIPE SAID BUT THE BIG ISSUES BEEN TOILET PAPER. AND SO YOU KNOW MY WIFE COMMENTS OFTEN VOIGTS STILL BUT THE YOU KNOW THE SHELVES ARE STILL EMPTY SO SOMEONE IS BUYING TOILET PAPER AT RETAIL. AND THEN- WE'RE GETTING REPORTS OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND SELLING IT THEMSELVES SOME MORALES. AND THEN THERE FOR PRICE CAPTION MAKING. OPPORTUNITY OUT OF- AS SENATE JACKSON SAID WERE WERE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE INSIDE. I I'M JUST CURIOUS HOW WITH THE D. A.'S RESOLVE. THAT SECOND TRANSACTION AND I ASK IT JUST SO THAT I CAN BE PREPARED TO RESPOND. AHEAD THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I THINK IF YOU BOUGHT TOILET PAPER AND YOU'RE NOW IN THE BUSINESS OF SELLING RETAIL TOILET PAPER AND YOU BUY IT FOR. A DOLLAR AND YOU SELL IT FOR TEN DOLLARS YES I THINK YOU WOULD BE IN VIOLATION OF THIS BILL- IF IT SHOULD BE ENACTED. THANK YOU CENTER BURKE THANK YOU MANAGER. SENATOR WIENER I THANK YOU ROGER I JUST WHEN I HAVE A- GIVEN THAT THE CLARITY OF YOU'RE GOING TO WORK WITH US I'M GONNA VOTE FOR THE BILL TODAY- IT'S A I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF IMPORTANT STUFF IN HERE SO I'M HAPPY TO. VOTE FOR. THANK YOU SIR. ALL RIGHT SO BEFORE I ASK YOU TO CLOSE I CAN OF COURSE SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE ELSE WANTS COMMON- MORE QUESTION FIVE. THE ORIGINAL BILL HAD BOTH THE LOBULAR AND A SEARCH WARRANT FOR MISDEMEANORS. NOW WE- I LOOK I THINK ALL OF US WELL LET ME SPEAK FOR MYSELF SO I DO REALLY BELIEVE IN CONSUMER PROTECTION ESPECIALLY DURING. THIS KIND OF AN EMERGENCY WHERE PEOPLE DO TRY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. AND BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT SO IT IS EIGHTY WHETHER IT'S A BIG CORPORATION THAT DOES IT OR YOUR CORNER STORE IS JUST AS BAD TO THE CONSUMER TO CONSUMER DOESN'T CARE. HOWEVER THERE'S SOME PERCEPTION BY CONSUMERS THAT THE CORNER STORE WHO SELLING SAY AN ITEM FOR MUCH MORE THEN YOU'D BUY IT AT COSTCO OR TARGET THAT SOMEHOW THAT MEANS IT'S PRICE GOUGING. AND THE CONSUMERS NOT REALIZING THAT KNOW THAT SMALL STORE COULD IT BY IN THEIR HAVING NO THEIR **** SUPPLY CHAIN IS ALSO- WHATEVER LIMITED THEY DON'T BUY IN THE BOOK THAT THE TARGETS OF THE COST GOES. DíAS THEY REALLY HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO SELL IT AT THAT HIGH PRICE AT LEAST THEY'RE MAKING IT AVAILABLE TO YOU. SO IT THIS IS ONE OF THESE AND THREADING THE NEEDLE. WELL I DO NOT WANT ANY STORE PRICE GOUGING ANYONE I ALSO DON'T WANT TO LOOK HAVE A FISHING EXPEDITION WHAT BECAUSE- YOU. A CORNER STORE THAT IS SELLING SOMETHING AT A HIGH PRICE WHICH MADE MAYBE REALLY THEY HAVE NO CHOICE. AND A PROSECUTOR WANTS TO YOU KNOW GET A HEADLINE OF. THE WIND SEE WE'VE YOU KNOW DON'T. WITH PRICE GOUGING HERE. AND THEN IS YOU KNOW IT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE MISDEMEANOR DATE THAT WE GIVE THEM THE ABILITY TO GO GET A SEARCH WARRANT AND OF COURSE THE SEARCH WARRANT IN AND OF ITSELF. IS VERY DISRUPTIVE TO A TO A BUSINESS OR TWO AND COSTLY. SO NOW A WAFFLER. I DON'T LIKE RARE IF ANYBODY WHO WATCHES THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS THAT WE RARELY EVER INCREASE THE PENALTY YOUR IT OR- TURN A CRIME THAT IS OTHER WHAT MISDEMEANOR AND FELONY. WE TRY TO AVOID. BUT I THINK WE AND JUST FOR THE MEMBERS TO KNOW THERE WAS A LOT OF A THERE WAS A LOT OF DISCUSSION ON THIS BILL THERE WAS A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH MICE THE STAFF AND THE COMMITTEE WORKED I THINK REALLY- DID JUST REALLY DILIGENTLY AND LOT OF GREAT INTERACTION WITH SENATOR UMBERG IN HIS STAFF TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT OKAY. HOW DO WE OUR OBJECTIVE IN THE COMMITTEES OBJECTIVE WAS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS BUT NOT JUST JUST- YOU KNOW CREATE THIS BIG NET FOR BIG FISHING EXPEDITIONS AND SO WE ENDED WITH SENATOR UMBERG'S. AGREEMENT THOUGH I WILL SAY THE AUTHOR WOULD PREFER THE SEARCH WARRANT BUT THAT'S OKAY TO GO WAFFLER BECAUSE IT ALLOWS FOR THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE THE DA CAN PROVE TO THE COURT OR DEMONSTRATE TO THE COURT THAT THEY REALLY THINK THIS SITUATION IS EGREGIOUS THAT THEY CAN GET THE SEARCH WARRANT. AND SPREAD IT DOESN'T JUST AUTOMATICALLY GRANT THE SEARCH WARRANT FOR SOMETHING THAT IS A MIST MISDEMEANORS THAT'S WHAT I WE WENT WITH THE DIRECTION WE WENT I IMAGINE I'M SURE THERE'S SOME. THE. WHO WHATEVER LIKE TO RETURN. THAT FEEL THAT EVEN ALONE IS. TWO FOUR. BUT I AM COME IN. IT BECAUSE IT IS A LIMITED TERM PRICE GOUGING ONLY APPLIES DURING THESE EMERGENCIES. AND SO THAT IS THAT LOGIC AND THAT IS WHY I AM SUPPORTING THE AMENDMENT THAT'S WHY I'M A AND THE BILL. AND APPRECIATIVE OF THE AUTHOR FOR ACCEPTING THE MINUTE. AND WITH THAT I'LL SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER COMMENTS OTHERWISE YOU MAY CLOSE. AS THEY CAN AND YOU'RE JUST A COUPLE QUICK COMMENTS WILL WE WILL GO DOWN THE SEARCH WARRANT HOLD BUT- IT SEARCH WARRANTS ARE CRITICAL IN A WHITE COLLAR CASE LIKE PRICE GOUGING BECAUSE YOU YOU YOU CAN'T PROVE. WHAT THE PROFIT MARGIN IS WITHOUT GETTING THE UNDERLYING DOCUMENTS FOR THE MOST PART AND IN SOME COMMUNITIES OF FOR EXAMPLE MY OWN DISTRICT PEOPLE- WILL REPORT THAT THERE'S BEEN PRICE GOUGING BUT THE RELUCTANT TO COME FORWARD YOU KNOW PERHAPS BECAUSE OF IMMIGRATION STATUS OR WHAT HAVE YOU BUT THE RELUCTANT TO COME FORWARD TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THEIR LOCAL. STORE TO SENATOR JACKSON'S POINT ABOUT. HAVING A FELONY AVAILABLE I BELIEVE THAT THAT IS CRITICAL IT IS CRITICAL TO TURN THE LARGER ENTITIES FROM GAUGING IN PRICE GOUGING AND YOU'RE RIGHT SENATOR- SKINNER THE PEOPLE MAY THINK THAT. YOU GO TO X. Y. Z. STORE AND YOU SEE THE PRICE MARKED UP IT MUST BE LEGITIMATE BECAUSE WHY WOULD X. Y. Z. STORE INCREASE PRICES TEN FOLD OF BECAUSE WE THINK THAT THEY'RE- CREDIBLE OPERATORS BUT SOME DO. AND THE AVAILABILITY OF FELONY DOES A COUPLE THINGS ONE IT SHOULD INTIMIDATE FOLKS UNDERPLAYING PRICE GOUGING BUT- IT YOU TRY TO. MONEY IN EUROPE TO ENTITY YOUR- THIS YOU STOCK PRICES GO TO TUMBLE IN THAT A- TO. I THANK TO AT LEAST SOME ENTITIES ANYWAY SO THAT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE BILL- THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER WEEK WE SPENT THE- ZERO AMOUNT OF TIME WORKING ON THIS STAFF. WORKED VERY HARD AND DILIGENTLY AND APPRECIATE MERGE NOVEL. ALL RIGHT WITH THAT IS THERE A MOTION. FOR A NEW BILLS MOVED AND- WE WILL GO THE BILL THE MOTION IS. TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS AS AMENDED OKAY- DO PASSES MEDI TO APPROPRIATIONS GO AHEAD ROLL CALL DO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER BY IN OUR AYE MORLOCK. MOORLACH AYE BRADFORD. JACKSON HI JACKSON AYE MITCHELL AYE MITCHELL AYE MORALE. WIENER WIENER HI. FIVE ZERO. ON THE BILL'S FIVE ZERO IT IS OUT AND- THANK YOU AND- SENATOR UMBERG ON BEFORE YOU. PICK UP YOUR NEXT BILL I JUST WANT TO- A ASK THE COMMITTEE'S INDULGENCE FOR A MOMENT I- SENATOR HER TITLE AN APOLOGY BECAUSE I- THOUGHT THAT GIVEN THE CALENDAR THAT WE DO NOT HAVE A NOTHER HEARING SCHEDULED THAT WE COULD NOT GRANT RECONSIDERATION BUT ACTUALLY WE CAN IF WE DO WE CHOOSE TO ALWAYS GRANT RECONSIDERATION THAT IS MY BAD IT WAS MY MISTAKE AND OF COURSE. WE KNOW THAT THE CALENDARS DO THIS YEAR THE CALENDAR OF WE MAY END UP HAVING ANOTHER HEARING CHAU I WANT TO A WITH THE- COMMITTEES A SUPPORT- GRANT RECONSIDERATION TO SENATOR FURTADO'S BILL AND APOLOGIZE TO HER THAT I MADE THAT ERROR SO WITH THAT WE'VE GRANTED RECONSIDERATION TO OUR BILL AND NOW WE WILL GO BACK TO SENATOR UMBERG AND WE WILL START WITH THE HEARING ON SB TWELVE TWENTY. THE YOUR NEXT BILL GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF WHAT ONCE AGAIN I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF IN PARTICULAR GAVE BECAUSE WELL THE THIS IS A CHALLENGING ISSUE. THAT HAS UNIQUE PERSPECTIVES I SUPPOSE I SHOULD TAKE PRIDE IN THE FACT THAT I HAVE UNITED THE ACLU PUBLIC DEFENDERS OF SOME RANK AND FILE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND C. H. P. ALL TO TAKE THE SAME POSITION. SADLY IT'S OPPOSING THE BILL- BUT WHAT BUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IT IS THAT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE A FAIR MECHANISM THAT ADDRESSES THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS AND ADDRESSES THE CONCERNS OF. FAIRNESS IN IN MAKING SURE THAT DEFENDANTS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE CRITICAL FOR THEM IN THE DEFENSE OF THEIR CASE BUT IS ALSO FAIR LAW ENFORCEMENT ALL THOSE AND PROVIDES FOR THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S A MECHANISM SO THAT THEY CAN COMPLY WITH THE CONSTITUTION REQUIREMENTS THE BILL SPONSORED BY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S ASSOCIATION- ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY NANCY O'MALLEY. WHO IS GOING TO TESTIFY I BELIEVE ON THE BILL AS WELL AS A MENTOR COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY GREG TOTTEN AND OTHERS CLING THEIR MORRIS OF WORKED EXTREMELY HARD ON THE BILL- IT AS YOU KNOW- THE BRADY DECISION REQUIRES THAT OF EVIDENCE MITIGATE SIR IS THIS CALL THE TORY BE PROVIDED TO- DEFENDANTS SO THEY CAN ACTUALLY DEFEND THEMSELVES. OF ONE OF THE CHALLENGES AND WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS IS IF THERE IS A% WITNESS THAT IT IS KNOWN TO HAVE- A POTENTIAL TO HAVE CERTAIN INFORMATION THAT MIGHT BE USED IN CROSS EXAMINATION IT IS THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY AT LEAST FOR DEFENSE COUNSEL TO. EXPLORE THAT THAT ISSUE AND IN ORDER TO DO SO A LOT THIS CREATED IT'S COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE BRADY LIST- THIS LAW THIS DECISION'S BEEN AFFECT FOR MANY MANY YEARS. WELL AS LONG FOR BERMAN AND THESE ARE OUR CA. THE THERE'S ISSUE IS TO AT DUTY. THERE ARE SOME THAT FOR WHATEVER REASON ARE ARE HAVING A CHALLENGE IN COMPLYING AND WHAT THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO DO IS TO CREATE A STATEWIDE STANDARD. A STATEWIDE STANDARD AS TO WHAT MUST BE- WENT WHEN AN OFFICER- HAS THIS ISSUE IN HIS OR HER. PAST THAT THAT WHAT ISSUES ARE REQUIRED BASICALLY TO- PLACE SOMEONE ON THE BRADY LIST. AND THEN ALSO- AN OPPORTUNITY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IF THEY ARE. IF THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE UNFAIRLY PLACED ON THE LIST THAT THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME SORT OF REVIEW. SO THAT THEY CAN GET OFF THE LIST I'VE HEARD- A SERIES OF STORIES OF THOSE WHO'VE BEEN PLACED ON THE READY LISTS THAT AT LEAST IN MY VIEW SHOULD BE ON THE BRACELET SO FOR EXAMPLE AN OFFICER THAT HAD A- MISDEMEANOR VANDALISM CONVICTION FROM SEVERAL YEARS AGO. THAT DOESN'T REALLY IMPACT THAT OFFICES CREDIBILITY BUT BEING ON THE BRADY LIST HAS A- VERY- THE- DETRIMENTAL IMPACT ON OFFICERS CAREER. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT ESTABLISHES BOTH- THE STANDARD A STANDARD FOR BEING PUT ON THE BRADY LIST OF STANDARD FOR BEING THE AT LEAST REVIEW. SO THAT OFFICER IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE SOME SORT OF DUE PROCESS. WITH ME OR AT LEAST ON THE PHONE WE HAVE DISTRICT ATTORNEY NANCY O'MALLEY AND THIS ATTORNEY GREG TOTTEN- I'LL TURN OVER THEM MADAM CHAIR. YES MODERATOR YOU CAN ALLOW THEM AND A APOLOGIES- WITNESSES KEY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT YOUR TOTAL TIME TO SHARE BETWEEN YOU IS THREE MINUTES THANK YOU. AN ADVISER OPEN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THIS IS NANCY O'MALLEY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF ALAMEDA COUNTY I'M ALSO THE CURRENT PRESIDENT OF CD A AND I'M HERE TO A TEST CITED THE IMPORTANCE OF SB TWELVE TWENTY. STILL ENHANCES THE EXISTING STATUTORY AND CASE LAW FROM BOTH THE UNITED STATES AND THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT. SP TWELVE SP TWELVE TWENTY DOES NOT DISTURB STATUTORY PROTECTIONS OF CONFIDENTIALITY OVER PERSONAL RECORDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. IT DOES HOWEVER BALANCE IN PRIORITIZE A CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS OF AN ACCUSED INDIVIDUAL IN A CRIMINAL PROCEEDING. IT IS THAT IMPORTANT BALANCE THE PROSECUTORS ACROSS CALIFORNIA VALUE. AND UNDER WHICH WE MUST OPERATE AS PROSECUTORS WE SEEK JUSTICE NOT SADLY CONVICTIONS. AS PROSECUTORS AT THE CORE OF OUR PROFESSIONALISM AND ETHICAL STANDARDS WE MUST PROVIDE THE DEFENSE WITH ANY AND ALL EVIDENCE IT MAY EXONERATED DEFENDANT INCLUDING EVIDENCE RELEVANT TO THE MORAL TURPITUDE AND HONESTY OF A PARTICULAR LAW ENFORCEMENT. HIS TESTIMONY IS MATERIAL TO THE GUILT OR INNOCENCE OF THE ACCUSED. THIS IS DECLARED IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE BY THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT AND BRADY VERSUS MARYLAND. AND WE HAVE FOLLOWED THIS LEGAL TENNIS AT BRADY FOR MORE THAN SIXTY YEARS. IN FACT THIS DELICATE BALANCE BETWEEN THE PROSECUTORS CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATIONS AND THE STATUTORY PROTECTIONS A POLICE OFFICER RECORDS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY EXISTED IN MANY COUNTIES SUCH AS ALAMEDA COUNTY LOS ANGELES VENTURA SAN MATTEO AND MANY MORE CROSS THE STATE. WE HAVE WRITTEN POLICIES AND PRACTICES CREATED WITH OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS AN ATTORNEY TO REPRESENT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. IT ENSURES COMPLETED COMPLIANCE WHILE RESPECTING THE LAWS PERTAINING TO PLEASE PERSONNEL RECORDS. BUT THESE WORKING POLICIES HAVE NOT BEEN UNIVERSALLY ENACTED ACROSS ALL COUNTIES ARE BY ALL AGENCIES. AND THESE WORKING POLICIES HAVE ALSO BEEN CHALLENGED IN COURT. AND TWENTY NINETEEN IN THE CASE ASSOCIATION FOR A LOS ANGELES DEPUTY SHERIFF'S VERSUS SUPERIOR COURT THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT UNANIMOUSLY DECLARED. THAT A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY DOES NOT VIOLATE THOSE POLICE OFFICER RECORD PROTECTIONS BY PROVIDING THE NAMES AND BADGE NUMBERS OF OFFICERS WHO MAY HAVE INFORMATION IN HIS OR HER PERSONAL RECORD. THAT WOULD FALL UNDER BRADY. TO BE CLEAR SB TWELVE TWENTY DOES NOT DISTURB THE CURRENT MANDATE AND PROTECTIONS OF RECORDS. RATHER IT REQUIRES LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY TO PROVIDE TO THE PROSECUTION THE NAME AND BADGE NUMBER OF AN OFFICER WHO MAY HAVE INFORMATION IN HIS OR HER PERSONAL RECORD. THE TRIGGER FOR THE COURTS REVIEW OF A PERSONAL RECORD IS NOT AN ALLEGATION OR INVESTING FOR THAT AN INVESTIGATION IS BEGAN. THE TRIGGERS OF FINDING MADE AGAINST THE OFFICER BARBIE- TOOK. RETURN DISHONESTY OR THAT THERE'S TERE WELL GROUNDED IN THE LOCK. IF THAT OFFICER BECOMES A WITNESS IN A CRIMINAL CASE THE PROSECUTOR CAN EITHER PROVIDE THE NAME AND BADGE NUMBER TO THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY OR FILE A MOTION WITH THE COURT IS IT. H. REFUSED. TO FILE AN- DEFINING SIX. NOT THERE'S ONLY MINUTE LEFT. THANK IT'S SO JUDGE PROVIDE ONLY THE RECORDS BOAST AND MORE ACROSS CERTAINLY THE DEFENSE AND ALL OF SOCIETY MUST BE ABLE TO RELY ON THE INTEGRITY OF THE CONVICTION SB TWELVE TWENTY ALLOWS THAT RELATES TO BE GROUNDED IN SOUND POLICY THAT ADDRESSES THE PRIVACY CONCERNS OF POLICE OFFICERS BUT THE OVER ARCHING CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION OF THE PROSECUTION TO ENSURE A FAIR TRIAL FOR THE DEFENDANT. I VOTE THANK YOU THE EIGHT TOP WE NOW HAVE THIRTY SECONDS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FIRST ISSUE I ONLY HAVE TWO POINTS FIRST. AS PROSECUTORS WE FIND OURSELVES FACING AN INSOLUBLE PROBLEM. WE ARE COMPELLED BY THE CONSTITUTION AND THE HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND TO DISCOVER TO THE DEFENSE ALL EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE. YEAH THE SAME TIME WE'RE HAMSTRUNG BY OUR LACK OF ACCESS TO THE VERY INFORMATION WE ARE DUTY BROWN TO PROVIDE. SADLY WE CAN'T DISCOVER WHAT WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO OR EVEN KNOW ABOUT. SECOND A RESPECTED PEACE OFFICER ASSOCIATIONS AND DEFENSE AND CIVIL LIBERTY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE OPPOSING THIS BILL. AND STAND READY TO WORK WITH THEM GOING FORWARD. BUT AS SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN DEALING WITH THIS INTRACTABLE ISSUE FOR MORE THAN TWO DECADES I CURRENTLY BELIEVE CENTER ON BURKE PROPOSAL STRIKES A NECESSARY TIMELY AND DELICATE BALANCE BETWEEN THEIR COMPETING INTERESTS.

THREE OF MY FAVORITE DJS ARI SUPPORT THE CHOICE DUDLEY FROM SANTA BARBARA WHO ACTUALLY DURING LAW SCHOOL WORK FOR ME SO I CAN ATTEST TO HER A COMMITMENT TO JUSTICE- I APPRECIATE THE HER CONCERN AND CERTAINLY A DISTRICT ATTORNEY TAWTON WHO HAS HAD A COMMENDABLE CAREER- INVENTOR COUNTY AND OF COURSE. MS O'MALLEY WHO IS ONE OF MY SHE AS WELL TAKING A POSITION I THINK THIS BILL DOES BACK. OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS- ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I ASKED WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT THIS IS- IT DOES INDICATE THE BILL SCOPE OF DISCLOSURE WOULD INCLUDE OFFICERS IN THE FOLLOWING CIRCUMSTANCES AND AMONG THEM ARE SUSTAIN FINDINGS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. A SUSTAINED FINDINGS OF DISHONESTY INCLUDING FILING FALSE REPORTS- CONVICTIONS OF MORAL TURPITUDE AND MY QUESTION IS. ARE BECAUSE I KNOW SO MANY OUTSTANDING A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS OUT WHY ARE THESE PEOPLE EVEN STILL ON THE FORCE. IN THEIR RESPECTIVE JURISDICTIONS- YOU KNOW THERE ARE SO MANY OUTSTANDING MEMBERS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OUT THERE- AND TO BE TAINTED BY THESE FOLKS A CHANCE TO IT I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S AN ANSWER TO IT BUT- IN READING THIS I WAS RELEASED ON THAT ACTUALLY. THOSE FOLKS MIGHT STILL BE POLICE OFFICERS AND SURE OF SOME OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT PEOPLE HIGHWAY PATROL YOU KNOW MY FAVORITE SO. IS THERE SOME X. FOR THAT IN THEN THE FACT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE A BRADY REVELATION DOESN'T. DISTURB ME AT ALL- I DO APPRECIATE CONCERNED ABOUT NOTICE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL AND THE ABILITY POTENTIALLY TO CHALLENGE SOME OF THOSE. DETERMINATIONS BUT- A- I FIND THIS TO BE A LITTLE DISCONCERTING THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY EVEN HAVING THAT PARTICULAR CONVERSATION BUT BELIEVE. I MEAN I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL I THINK IT'S A THE IMPORTANT. BUT I WONDER CAN YOU RESPOND OR IS YUR RESPONSE TO HOW WE COULD BE IS STILL DEALING WITH THE- LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS WHO ARE. IN FACT SUBJECT TO. OR HAVE HAD THESE FINDINGS IN OFFENSES THAT THE PERHAPS PERHAPS MORE WE COULD THE MAN AND MIGHT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY TOTTEN WHO DIDN'T GET THE SPEAKER HE STILL THE LINE IF HE COULD PERHAPS. HELP WITH THE NEXT TWENTY ON THAT FOR MOLECULAR FOR THE AUTHOR REACH. AND IF WANT THE D. EIGHT ADD WE WILL ALLOW THAT I JUST WANT TO THE D. EIGHT. TO NOTE THAT I DID MAKE PUSH FOR. BOTH LET ME MANAGER LET ME BE THERE IS A AND THEN THE ATTORNEY TODD WHOSE BETTER THAN I IN THE AIR. PROBABLY CAN SUPPLEMENT. THE WHAT WHAT THE CHANNEL IS THAT IS THE- OF MORAL TERM NOR TO DO THAT IS WELL SO FOR. IS A- DRUNK DRIVING. FOR FIVE YEAR AGO IS THAT A REFLECTION OF MORAL. DOES THAT NEED TO BE SLOW TO THE FENCE SO YOU SOME SAY NO WE WERE TRYING TO CA. THAT SO I WOULDN'T ASSUME THAT EVERYONE WHO HAS WHO CERTAINLYSHOWS UP ON THE BRADY LIST SHOULD NO LONGER BE A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL MAYBE YES MAYBE NO BUT BUT I DON'T THINK WE COULD MAKE THAT. THAT THAT ASSUMPTION- SO DISTRIBUTARY TIGHTENED A MAN SURE IF HE MIGHT RESPOND I WOULD PERSONALLY DE ETAT IF YOU'RE STILL ON THE LINE YOU MAY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON'S YES. FIRST OF ALL WE ARE IN MANY OF THESE SITUATIONS DEALING WITH PERSONNEL ACTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN BY A FRONTLINE POLICE AGENCY AND THEN WE LEARN ABOUT IT- VIA BRADY AND THE PITCHES HEARING PROCESS FOLLOWING A JUDICIAL DECISION. SO IN SOME OF THOSE CASES- LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES TERMINATE- BUT THE INDIVIDUAL OFFICER- PARTICULARLY WHEN IT INVOLVES SERIOUS ACTS OF DISHONESTY- BUT THAT OFFICER MAY STILL WIND UP EVEN AFTER THEIR TERMINATED- BEING A WITNESS IN A SUBSEQUENT CASE AND THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE DISCLOSED TO THE DEFENSE. AND WOULD WOULD BE SUBJECTED TO THE OFFICER WOULD BE THE FORMER OFFICER WOULD BE SUBJECT SUBJECTED TO EXAMINATION ON THAT ISSUE IN OTHER CASES- INVOLVING. ACTION THE AGENCY MAY WANT TO TERMINATE THE OFFICER BUT MAY BE PROHIBITED FROM DOING SO BY THE JUDICIAL AUTHORITY OR AN ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING PROCESS AND SO THOSE OFFICERS THAT STILL REMAIN ON THE FORCE- WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THIS PROCESS AND WE WOULD HAVE ACCESS. TO AT LEAST THEIR NAME AND BADGE NUMBER SO THAT WE COULD REQUEST A JUDICIAL HEARING AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THAT PRIOR MISCONDUCT- WARNS DISCLOSURE UNDER BRADY IN A IN A SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE WOULD WOULD MAKE THAT WHAT THIS BILL SEEKS TO DO IS INSURE THAT WE SIMPLY HAVE THE NAME AND BADGE NUMBER. OF THE OFFICERS THAT HAVE THESE ISSUES IN THEIR BACKGROUND SO THAT WE CAN APPROPRIATELY DISCLOSE EXCULPATORY INFORMATION TO THE DEFENSE. THANK YOU AYE MAGISTAD THAT AMONG THE OFFENSES NACHOS. MORAL TURPITUDE AND DISHONESTY BUT- SUSTAIN FINDINGS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. OF WITH A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC SO. THESE ARE SOME SERIOUS SERIOUS- CONSIDERATIONS AND I DO APPRECIATE. THAT RESPONSE THANK YOU DISTRICT ATTORNEY TODD. RIGHT ANY OTHER MEMBERS WANT TO ASK A QUESTION OR COMMENT CENTER BRADFORD. NOT AS MUCH OF A QUESTION BUT A STATEMENT AND I APPRECIATE- THE WORK THAT CENTER ON BURKE IS DONE IN THIS YEAR IT'S NO DOUBT THAT. WE NEED TO HAVE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS TO BAD ACTORS BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN THROUGHOUT. THE STATE THIS COUNTRY EVEN WHEN YOU CATCH IT ON VIDEOTAPE MANY OF THESE ALTER STEEL- SCAPE- PROSECUTION OR EVEN CHARGES SO I THINK IT'S TIME WE I JUST DON'T THINK IT GOES FAR ENOUGH I THINK IT STILL PROVIDES TOO MUCH OF A LEAD WAY TO- ALLOW OFFICERS TO BE ESCAPE FROM THIS AND I DO BELIEVE THERE NEEDS TO BE. A OPPORTUNITY TO CLEAR THEIR NAMES AS IT STATES HERE BUT I THINK THE SAME OPPORTUNITY SHOULD BE AFFORDED TO BLACK AND BROWN INDIVIDUALS WHO SPEND THE REST OF YOUR LIFE ON GANG INJUNCTIONS AND THEY'RE NEVER FOR THAT SAME OPPORTUNITY SO. I THINK UNTIL WE CAN HAVE SOME BALANCE HERE- I OR EVEN MORE FIXED OF. WHAT C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;. BE ON THE&lt;/c&gt;</u> LIST I'M HAVE TO STAY OFF OF FOR TODAY BUT I THINK YOU'RE. HER EIGHT AS YOU TO CLOSE. SO THIS ONE IS. IT WILL THIS OF A- GREAT CAN UNDER FOR THE COMEDIAN THAT WE HAVE THE MANY OF THE SAME ENTITIES THAT SUPPORTED FOR EXAMPLE THE POLICE RECORDS BILL SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE NOW OPPOSING THIS- BUT WE ALSO HAVE- SOME AT LEAST ARE POLICE- UNIONS AND- THE ALSO OPPOSING. AND YOU KNOW HOW HOW AGAIN FOR USE THE PHRASE APPEARS TO MANY TIMES STATE THREAD THAT NEEDLE AND- WHAT WHAT STRIKES ME ABOUT WHAT THE BILL IS TRYING TO DO. IS A NARROW CODIFICATION OF A COURT RULING AND WHAT- I SUPPOSE WHAT I'D- I'D APPRECIATE- THAT. LAW ENFORCEMENT. DIDN'T LIKE THAT COURT RULING AND SO DOESN'T NECESSARILY- WOULD NOT LIKE US TO CODIFY THE COURT RULING BUT I WOULD POINT OUT THAT WE ALREADY HAVE OFFICERS OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE STATE WHO ARE UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THIS LOG BECAUSE THEY ARE COUNTIES OPTED TO COMPLY WITH THE COURT RULING. NOW IT IS NOT BEEN CONSISTENT IT IS NOT EVERYWHERE IN THE STATE THAT- OFFICERS ARE SUBJECT TO THIS BECAUSE NOT ALL YOU KNOW BUT FOR EXAMPLE THE SEATS IF I DON'T KNOW QUITE WHY THE STATE DIDN'T BUT CHP IS NOT. HAVING TO COMPLY THIS WAY- BUT MANY IN MANY COUNTIES EVERY OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT. OFFICIAL DOES SO WHILE I APPRECIATE THAT MANY OF OUR- ADVOCATES WOULD WOULD AS CENTER BRADFORD DESCRIBED WANT US TO. NOT MOVE TO CODIFY THIS WITHOUT BEING MORE EXPANSIVE I GUESS WHERE I FELL IS THAT. THIS I A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION NOW OF COURSE THERE IS ALWAYS THE CONCERN THAT IF WE TAKETHIS STEP THEN. IT WILL BE A EITHER WILL MAKE IT VERY VERY DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO GO FURTHER NOW OF COURSE FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT SINCE PERSPECTIVE ARE TAKING EVEN THIS STEP IS A STEP TOO FAR. AND I GUESS I AM COMFORTABLE WITH CODIFYING. THE COURT DECISION IN THE NEAR A WAY THAT IT'S BEEN CONSTRUCTED I CERTAINLY DO- AND WOULD ENTERTAIN A BILL THAT WENT FURTHER. BUT I GUESS I DON'T OPPOSE TAKING THE POSITIVE STEP IN THE DIRECTION SO- THAT IS WHY I HAVE RECOMMENDED THAT IS WHY I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL IS CONSTRUCTED. AND APPRECIATING THAT FEAR AS WE'VE HEARD FROM THE TESTIMONY THERE WILL BE MANY- THERE WILL BE LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DO NOT- LIKE THAT DECISION IN THERE WILL BE ADVOCATES WHO OR ADVOCATES- LAW ENFORCEMENT'S ALSO ADVOCATES BUT RATHER. ADVOCATE TO WANT MORE DISCLOSURE WHO WOULD NOT BE HAPPY WITH THAT BUT I THINK SOME ACTION TO MAKE IT A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD ACROSS THE STATE THAT SO THAT ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ARE. FUNCTIONING UNDER THE COURT RULING IS AT IMPROVEMENT OVER WHAT WE HAVE NOW. LET'S SEE IF THERE IS A MOTION OR NOT. SO RIGHT WE DO HAVE A MOTION IS THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTER. SENATOR UMBERG YOU CAN CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- IN MEMBERS LET ME FIRST ADDRESS OF THE BRADFORDS BUT ONE OF HIS ISSUES SPENT AND THEN SOME OF THE OTHER CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED- TAKING THIS BILL FROM THE DEFENDANT'S PERSPECTIVE. WORST CASE SCENARIO IS WHERE THERE'S A ON OFFICER WHO IS A KEY WITNESS WHO HAS SOMETHING IN HIS OR HER BACKGROUND SO FOR EXAMPLE LET'S SAY A SUSTAIN FINDING OF FILING A FALSE POLICE REPORT. THE DEFENDANT AND HIS LAWYER HER LAWYER SHOULD SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THAT SO THAT THEY CAN EXAMINE THE OFFICE OF SADLY THERE ARE SOME CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THAT IS NOT BEING REVEALED TODAY SO IF YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT AND IT CAN'T BE. JUST THEN YOU MAY HAVE AN UNFAIR RESULTS SO WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS BY THE WAY THIS IS THIS IS A FLOOR NOT A CEILING COULD DO MORE. IT'S A SIMPLE A SORT OF BASE STANDARD. SO FROM THE- YOU WANT INFORMATION. AND YOU WANT POLICE ENTITIES HAVE TO BE ABLE.-A REVEAL THOSE OFFICERS WHO MAY HAVE IS. SUCH AS THAT IN THEIR FILE. FROM THE POLICE OFFICERS PERSPECTIVE. IT IS TRUE AND I'VE HEARD MANY STORIES OF POLICE OFFICERS THAT ARE PUT ON THE BRADY LIST THAT PERHAPS IT SHOULD BE ON THE BRINK LIST. BUT MANY PLACES IN THE STATE ARE NOT LIKE FOR EXAMPLE ALAMEDA CEMETERY VENTURA COUNTY THEY DON'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ANY REVIEW. THEY DON'T HAVE AN OTHER THAN GOING TO COURT IN AND FILING A WRIT WHICH IS BOTH EXPENSIVE AND VERY VERY DIFFICULT SO THEY CAN'T THEY THEY CAN'T GET OFF THE LIST. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME EVER THIS IS DELICIOUS A FLOOR. OTHER DISTRICT ATTORNEY CAN PROVIDE EVEN MORE AND YOU CAN GO. ONE FOUR. THE LEAST THIS OF. EVER LAW AND- ON AND I. TO HAVE. SORT OF REVIEW IN THE STATE. THEN FROM THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S PERSPECTIVE. THEY WANT TO DO THEY WANT TO DO JUSTICE AND SO THEY WANT TO REVEAL IF THIS IS EXCULPATORY MITIGATING INFORMATION THEY WANT TO REVEAL THAT. FOR SEVERAL REASONS ONE TO DO JUSTICE BUT ALSO IS THIS BECOMES AVAILABLE THIS COMES TO LIGHTLATER ON. THAT CONVICTION COULD BE REVERSED AND SO THAT DOESN'T DO ANY GOOD FOR ANYBODY ANYWAY SO THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL TRIES TO DO ADMITTEDLY THERE'S STILL THINGS THAT NEED TO BE WORKED OUT ADMITTEDLY WE'D LIKE TO HAVE A MORE DEFINED LIST OF WHAT IS MORAL TURPITUDE. WORKING HARD WE'RE WE'RE WORKING HARD TO TRY TO GET THESE THINGS RESOLVED BUT- BUT- BUT THIS IS A TOUGH ISSUE AND WE'RE GOING TO KEEP WORKING AT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR URGED BIBLE.
