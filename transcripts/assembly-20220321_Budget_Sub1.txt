THAT ARE WRITTEN THROUGH THE SUB ONE EMAIL ACCOUNT AND THE ADDRESS IS BUDGET SUB ONE ACT ASM DOT CA DOT GOV. BEFORE WE BEGIN I CAN'T HELP BUT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE LENGTH OF THE AGENDA. WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT IT IT'S MAGNITUDE OTHER THAN THAT MAYBE WE WILL ALL BE HERE TILL QUITE LATE INTO THE EVENING. IS THAT IT REFLECTS TWO VERY IMPORTANT TRUTHS. FIRST THE BREATH A PUBLIC HEALTH IS EXTENSIVE AND TOUCHES ON EVERY ASPECT OF OUR LIVES AND IT IS DOWNRIGHT MIND BOGGLING. FROM INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONTROL TO DISEASE SURVEILLANCE IT SYSTEMS TO HOMELESSNESS AND CLIMATE CHANGE TO THE IMPACT OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION ON MENTAL WELL BEING. TO PHYSICAL FITNESS FROM EARLY CHILDHOOD LITERACY TO THE END OF LIFE AND FROM THE BLACK INFANT HEALTH TO THE HEALTH OF NURSING HOME RESIDENTS. AND NO DOUBT THERE ARE MANY MORE. SECOND IT APPEARS THAT THE PANDEMIC'S SILVER LINING HAS BEEN TO CREATE AWARENESS OF AND APPRECIATION FOR THE CRITICAL VALUE OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AS IT STATES IN THE AGENDA PUBLIC HEALTHIS INVISIBLE AT LEAST WHEN IT'S SUCCESSFUL. AND FOR THIS REASON BOTH OF THE DEPARTMENT CD P. H. AND M. SAW HAVE BEEN IGNORED AND UNDERFUNDED FOR TOO MANY DECADES AGREE WITH EVERY DETAIL. WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR THESE DEPARTMENTS OVERALL IT IS UNDOUBTABLY A LONG OVERDUE RIGHT SIZING OF THE STATE'S INVESTMENT% INTO THE FUTURE OF THE STATE'S PUBLIC HEALTH. FINALLY AS WE ARE MERGED FROM THE PANDEMIC I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT YOU ALL HAVE BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES OF DEFENSE. WE OFTEN REFLECT ON THE THOUSANDS OF LIVES THAT WE HAVE LOST TO COVERT. YET WE ALSO NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE MILLIONS OF LIVES THAT WERE NOT LOST TO COPE ED AS A RESULT OF YOUR HER ROLE WAKE AND TIRELESS EFFORTS. SO ON BEHALF OF ALL OF US WHO ARE STILL HERE THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR INVALUABLE SERVICE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WITH THAT WE WILL BEGIN OUR FIRST PANEL. WHICH WILL COVER BOTH ISSUES ONE AND TWO BOTH OUR EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AUTHORITY PROPOSALS WE WILL HAVE JUST 1% ARE ON THIS PANEL RICK TRUSSELL WHO IS THE CHIEF OF ADMINISTRATION FOR EMSA. AFTER YOU PRESENT YOUR FIRST PROPOSAL WE WILL PAUSE FOR QUESTIONS BEFORE GOING ON TO THE SECOND CAN YOU PLEASE BEGIN.

AN ONGOING FUNDING OF ONE MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND GENERAL FUND AND THREE HUNDRED FORTY NINE THOUSAND REIMBURSEMENTS TO SUPPORT THE CALIFORNIA POISON CONTROL SYSTEM. THIS AUGMENTATION IS BEING REQUESTED DUE TO INCREASED SALARIES AND BENEFIT EXPENSES RESULTING FROM NEGOTIATED UNION BARGAINING AGREEMENTS AND WILL CONTINUE STABLE FUNDING FOR DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS. THE CALIFORNIA POISON CONTROL SYSTEM AND CONTINUED STATEWIDE ACCESS TO POISON CENTER SERVICES IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY. THANK YOU I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS SEEING NO QUESTIONS I WILL JUST- SPEAK TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS POISON CENTER AND WANTS TO APPRECIATE ALL OF YOU WHO HAVE WORKED HARD TO MAKE SURE IT CONTINUES TO BE- A TOOL THAT THOSE ON THE FRONT LINES CAN USE. WITH THAT WE WILL NOW ASK YOU TO PRESENT ON ISSUE TO PLEASE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR KIND WORDS AND SUPPORT SIR- THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AUTHORITY- US TO BE ISSUE NUMBER TWO IS THE PERMANENT DISCIPLINARY REVIEW BOARD. MS IS REQUESTING THREE POSITIONS AND SEVEN HUNDRED THREE THOUSAND- DOLLARS EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES PERSONNEL FUND IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. AND SIX HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND MSP FUND IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AN ONGOING TO IMPLEMENT CHAPTER FOUR SIX THREE STATUTES OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE OR EIGHTY FOUR FIFTY.

THANK YOU BRING IT UP TO THE D√çAS- I'M AYE WE NOTICED THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING A SECOND LICENSING FEE INCREASE VERY SOON AFTER THE LAST INCREASE. AND I'M WONDERING WHETHER OR NT WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE LICENSING FEE AND IF IT HAS NOW BECOME. BURDENSOME ON INDIVIDUALS THAT IT'S NOW A BARRIER FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO ENTER THE FIELD. IF SO COULD YOU PLEASE GIVE US A COST ESTIMATE FOR THE STATE TO SUBSIDIZE THE PROGRAM BE A GENERAL FUND. RATHER THAN SUPPORTING A FEE INCREASE. WELL TO ADDRESS YOUR FIRST CONCERN IS THAT WE DID DO A PHASED IN APPROACH OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS TO RAISE THE FEES TO MEET OUR INCREASED OPERATING COSTS FOR THE PARAMEDIC LICENSURE ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM. AB FOUR FIFTY WAS AN UNEXPECTED PIECE OF LEGISLATION WHICH WAS PASSED AND THE FUNDS COULD NOT ABSORB THE ADDITIONAL EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH A PERMANENT BOARD SO. THAT THAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROPOSAL AND THE FEE INCREASE AT THIS TIME- DO YOU FEEL THAT THE FEES ARE BECOMING BURDENSOME AND BECOMING A HINDRANCE FOR PEOPLE TO ENTER INTO THE FIELD. I'M I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IT'S A HINDRANCE AT THIS TIME I MEAN A LOT OF THE PARAMEDIC LICENSING FEES ARE PAID BY THE EMPLOYERS. I'M SO THAT OFFSETS THE COST- WE ARE INCREASING IT BY SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS PER LICENSE- AGAIN THAT IS JUST THE COST OF ABSORBING THE HERMETIC DISCIPLINARY BOARD EXPENSES. I'M I CAN PROVIDE THAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO YOU AS A FOLLOW UP BECAUSE I JUST DON'T HAVE A RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF ME ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD TAKE FOR THE GENERAL FUND TO FILL THAT GAP. PERFECT AND WITH THAT WE WILL THANK VERY MUCH MISTER TRUSSELL WE WILL MOVE ON THE PANEL TO WHICH IS ON THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS PROPOSAL WE WILL HAVE SEVEN PRESENTERS WHO ARE ON THIS PANEL INCLUDING. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND INFORMATION THE L. A. O. AND SEVERAL STAKEHOLDERS. LET US BEGIN WITH SUSAN FANELLI WHO IS THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF POLICY AND PROGRAMS AT CDPH. AFTERNOON CHEN MEMBERS I'M GONNA FIRST TURN IT OVER TO SCOTT CRESSMAN BECAUSE THEY RUN THE COMMUTER BENEFIT PROGRAM HE'S GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME OVERVIEW AND THEN I'LL PROVIDE. ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU STUDENT THANK YOU TRUCKERS ARAMBULA THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THE CHANCE TO SPEAK TODAY SCOTT CHRISTMANN CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE ACCESS INFORMATION. FOR EACH CAR. OF THE STATE AND FEDERAL COMMITTEE BENEFIT LAWS REQUIRE NONPROFIT HOSPITALS PROVIDE COMMUNITY BENEFITS AS A CONDITION OF THEIR TAX EXEMPT STATUS. NONPROFIT HOSPITALS CREATE COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLANS WHICH PROVIDE A DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT THE HOSPITAL CONTRIBUTE. WITHIN ITS MISSION AND FINANCIAL CAPACITY TO ADDRESS IDENTIFIED COMMUNITY NEEDS. CURRENT LAW DOES NOT PRESCRIBE A REQUIRED LEVEL OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS PROVIDED BY NONPROFIT HOSPITALS OR HOW COMMUNITY BENEFITS SHOULD BE ALLOCATED. ADDITIONALLY COMMITTEE BUT ORGANIZATION CBO'S PLAY A KEY ROLE IN ADDRESSING THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND MAY BE BASED IN THE SECTOR OTHER THAN HEALTH WHICH BRING ADDITIONAL SKILLED PERSPECTIVES AND COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS TO PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS. THIS COULD INCLUDE HOUSING SECURITY FOOD SECURITY ECONOMIC STABILITY SCHOOLS AND CHILDCARE COMMITTEE PILOTS AND HATE CRIMES YOU CRIMINAL JUSTICE ENVIRONMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE TRANSPORTATION. COMMITTEE CASSIDY BUILDING. THE STATE INTENDS TO LEVERAGE THIS EXPERTISE TO ADVANCE EQUITY AND REDUCE DISPARITIES IN HEALTH OUTCOMES WITHIN COMMUTER. TO PROMOTE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE FOCUSED ON PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORTS THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO REQUIRE THAT NONPROFIT HOSPITALS DEMONSTRATE HOW THEY'RE MAKING INVESTMENTS IN LOCAL HEALTH EFFORTS SPECIFICALLY COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT ADDRESS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. THE ADMINISTRATION ALSO PROPOSES STATUTORY CHANGES THAT WOULD DIRECT 25% OF THE NONPROFIT HOSPITAL COMMUNITY BENEFIT DOLLARS GO TO THESE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORTS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS PROPOSAL EXCLUDES UNCOMPENSATED CARE WHICH IS OFTEN REPORTED BY HOSPITALS IN THEIR COMMITTEE BENEFIT PLANS. H. CAR CURRENTLY COLLECTS COMMUTER BENEFIT PLANS FOR NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND POSTED TO OUR WEBSITE FOR PUBLIC ACCESS WE'VE BEEN COLLECTING THESE PLANTS SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX WHICH PREDATES THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR HOSPITAL COMMUNITY BENEFITS ENACTED THROUGH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AFFECTED SINCE TWENTY TWELVE THE ACA AT THE NATIONAL REQUIREMENT IN FEDERAL TAX LAW FOR NONPROFIT HOSPITAL ENTITIES TO REPORT COMMUNITY BENEFIT SPENDING AS PART OF THEIR NONPROFIT TAX STATUS REQUIREMENTS. THE FEDERAL REPORTING CAN BE DONE AT THE HEALTH SYSTEM LEVEL CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRES REPORTING AT THE HOSPITAL LEVEL. AND FOR REFERENCE H. CAR COLLECTED ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT SUCH REPORTS IN TWENTY TWENTY THIS INCLUDES ALL NONPROFIT HOSPITALS IN THE STATE EXCEPT A SMALL NUMBER OF RURAL HOSPITALS. BUT ARE NOT PART OF THE WHOLE SYSTEM. AB TWO OH ALL BY. WOOD SIGNED INTO LAW IN TWENTY NINETEEN NOW REQUIRES HOSPITALS TO DESCRIBE HOW NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN THE COMMUNITY ARE BEING ADDRESSED TO DESCRIBE THE METHODOLOGY USED IN VALUING BENEFITS THEY PROVIDE TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND FOR THE CHARITY CARE AMOUNTS TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE CHARITY CARE COST IS REPORTED TO EACH GUY IN THEIR FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE REPORTS. EIGHTY TWO OH FOUR ALSO REMOVED A RESTRICTION FROM STANDARDIZING COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN RECORDED. THESE READING FULLER PREVENTS THAT HELP MOVE TO A MORE STANDARDIZED REPORTING THE BENEFIT INFORMATION AND BETTER TRANSPARENCY AROUND MANY BEEN A BENEFITS BROADLY. THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL WOULD FURTHER ADVANCE HOSPITAL TRANSPARENCY REQUIRING EACH PRODUCT REVISED REPORTING SPECIFICATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS THAT HOSPITALS MUST FOLLOW IN THE REPORTS. THE PROPERLY CATEGORIZED UNSPECIFIED COMMUNITY BENEFIT SPENDING. TO OTHERWISE DEMONSTRATE HOSPITAL COMMUNITY BENEFIT TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE FOCUSED ON PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORTS. AND TO BETTER ALIGN CALIFORNIA'S REQUIREMENTS WITH THE FEDERAL TAX REQUIREMENTS AND SPENDING CATEGORIES. H. CHI WOULD CONTINUE TO POST THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLANS ON ITS WEBSITE EXPANDING THE TRANSPARENCY GOALS ABOUT IN THE ORIGINAL AUTHORIZING STATUTE AND FURTHER BY AB TOOL FOR TO BETTER INFORM LOCAL COMMUNITY INTERESTS AND NEED FOR THESE INVESTMENTS. REGARDING OUR ROLE IN HR IN MONITORING AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE NEW POLICY WHICH WAS NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA. EMPHASIS IS PERFECT PLACE ON GREATER TRANSPARENCY FOR HOSPITAL COMMUNITY BENEFITS RECOGNIZING THESE BENEFITS TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES IMPORTANT AND SERVES TO INFLUENCE COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND STAKEHOLDERS. LIKEWISE GREATER TRANSPARENCY GIVES OPPORTUNITY FOR SHARING BEST PRACTICES AND INNOVATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS AND CREDITS NONPROFIT HOSPITALS REDUCE IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS AFFINITY BENEFITS. AB TWO OH FOUR ALSO CREATED A FINE OF UP TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A HOSPITAL FAILURE TO COMPLETE A COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENT WHAT WHAT DOCTOR COMMITMENT OF A PLANT. OR TO SUBMIT A COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN TO H. CAUGHT. THIS PROPOSAL WILL IN THAT AMOUNT OF THE UP TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND AND EXPEDIENT. THE FINE TO ALSO APPLY AT THE HOSPITAL BILLS TO IDENTIFY THE PRIORITY COMMUNITY NEEDS A BLUEGRASS OR FAILED TO SPECIFY HOW THE SPENDING THRESHOLD. WILL BE ALLOCATED TO PRIORITY COMMUNITY NEEDS. H. GUY WILL ENGAGE IN A PUBLIC RULE MAKING PROCESS TO SPECIFY THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PROGRAM. THROUGH REGULATION HR WILL DEVELOP STANDARDIZED DEFINITIONS METHODOLOGY CAN REPORTING WHICH WILL ALLOW COMMUNITY BENEFIT AMOUNTS TO BE QUANTIFIED AND ANALYZED. BUT WE ALSO WORK WITH CDPH ON ANY APPROPRIATE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO MEET THE GOALS OF DEMONSTRATING INVESTMENTS IN COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH INVESTMENT AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS AND CDPH AND ALL STAKEHOLDERS ON THE PROPOSAL GOING FORWARD. AND NOW WILL LOOK BACK TO TWO SUSAN CANNELLA TO SPEAK TO THE QUESTION BECAUSE OF YOUR GENDER. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. GOOD CARE MEMBERS I'M THIS PROPOSAL REALLY IS ABOUT BETTER CONNECTING THE INVESTMENTS OF THESE HOSPITALS TO THE COMMUNITY NEEDS AND TO THE- COMMUNITIES AND WITH THE GREATEST NEEDS. ANSWER THE FIRST QUESTION IS WHAT TO THE HOSPITAL'S NOW SPEND THESE FUNDS ON NOW. THE TRUTH IS THEY SPEND ABOUT SIX BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND I'M- ON. THE BENEFITS AND THAT INCLUDES ABOUT FOUR BILLION WHICH IS REALLY- UNCOMPENSATED CARE INCLUDING CHARITY CARE AND THAT IS THINGS LIKE MEDICARE. MEDICARE AND MEDICAID ALL SHORTFALLS AS WELL AS- INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT INSURANCE. I AM RIGHT NOW THEY SEND THEY SUBMIT QUALITATIVE REPORTS NOT NECESSARILY QUANTITATIVE THAT GO INTO THE DETAIL OF EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE SPENDING ON WHICH INVESTMENTS AND SO WHAT WE- BELIEVE IS THAT MANY OF THEM ARE ALREADY SPENDING SOME OF THESE BONDS IN THE AREAS THAT WE MOST WOULD WANT TO SEE THEM SPEND MY MEN. AND ADDRESSING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH BUT WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH OF THAT TWO BILLION THAT IS NOT THE UNCOMPENSATED CARE REALLY IS GOING TO THIS EFFORT. AND SO REALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO GET MORE TRANSPARENCY AND WITH THIS LIMITED INFORMATION. I CAN'T REALLY TELL WHAT AREAS ARE GETTING THE MOST INVESTMENTS WHAT THEY'RE INVESTING IN AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FIRST STEP IS COLLECTING THAT INFORMATION AND THEN THE SECOND STEP IS SORT OF MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE GOING TO THE CBO BECAUSE- I'M- AN TO UPPER INVESTORS THAT WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. ALIGNING THE COMMUNITY NEEDS- WITH THE INVESTMENTS. I'M SO TO A- REPRESENTATIVES OF HAAS HAVE THAT THEY ALREADY CLOSELY WITH COMMUNITIES. AND SO WE THINK THAT THAT VARIES ACROSS THE STATE AND THAT THERE ARE INDEED SOME HOSPITALS THAT WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH. THE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS COMMUNITY ASSESSMENTS WORK WITH C. B. I WAS ON THE GROUND I BET IT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS REALLY TO. LEVERAGE THESE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING THOSE COMMUNITIES MOST IN NEED BUT THEN THE HOSPITAL SERVICE AREA AND HOSPITALS DUE TO FIND THEIR SERVICE AREA DIFFERENTLY AND SO WE WANT TO MAYBE EXPAND ON THAT SERVICE ORDERED. A SERVICE AREA DEFINITION SO THAT WE REALLY CAN REACH THOSE AREAS OF THE COMMUNITY MOST IN NEED. EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN IMPROVE THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT PROGRAM BY. ADDING A LEVEL OF EVALUATION AND IMPACT OF THESE INVESTMENTS SO THAT WE CAN SEE WHAT'S WORKING ON SOME OF THESE COMMUNITIES AND BE ABLE TO SCALE THAT UP WE CAN USE COLLECTIVE IMPACT MODEL TO MAYBE- DEROZAN. AREAS OF INVESTMENTS OF THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE IMPACT ON THE GROUND. WE REALLY NEED THAT BASELINE INFORMATION WHICH IS WHAT- AGE KIND WILL BE WORKING ON AND STANDARDIZING SOME OF THAT REPORTING. I'M AND WE WANT TO REALLY ENCOURAGE. COLLECTIVE IMPACT RATHER THAN SMALL ISOLATED INVESTMENTS WHICH. MAY NOT HAVE SUSTAINABLE IMPACT. HELLO THIS AND SHE THESE BANNER FUND ARE REACHING A- HIGH AREA COMMUNE CALL HI NEED COMMUNITIES AND STATE. I WE CAN'T ASSURE. AND THIS IS NOT THE HOLES. TO COMMUNITY BENEFITS. TO THE COMMUNITY BASED. VAST AMOUNTS THE GOAL OF THIS IS TO IMPROVE THE COMMUTER BENEFIT PROGRAM EVALUATE AND IMPROVE THE IMPACT OF THESE INVESTMENTS. I'M AND AGAIN. THERE'S A LOT OF pAMBIGUITY IN THE DEFINITION OF HOSPITAL SERVICE AREA I'M AND CAN BE DEFINED BY. THEIR PATIENT POPULATION AREA WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE THE MOST NEEDY AREAS OF THE COMMUNITIES. AND IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO COLLABORATE WITH HOSPITALS THIS IS REALLY THE FIRST STEP IN HAVING BETTER TRANSPARENCY ENGAGING OUR HOSPITAL CBO'S AND LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS. TO ENSURE THAT THESE INVESTMENTS HAVE THE IMPACT IMPACT WE ALL WANT IN THE COMMUNITIES WITH THE GREATEST ME. WITHOUT ALL I'LL STOP THERE AND CERTAINLY HAPPY ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS WE ARE CONTINUING TO WORK ON ST LANGUAGE THAT WE WILL BE SHARING SHORTLY AND THAT WILL LAY THIS OUT A LITTLE MORE DETAIL FOR EVERYONE TO SEE AND THEN. WE'LL BE WORKING WITH THE HOSPITALS MOVING FORWARD WE HAVE. MET WITH PH I KNOW THEY'VE DONE I HAVE A REPORT THAT WE'VE MET WITH BEEN GONE OVER AND WITH HEALTH BACKSTOPS THAT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS. TO MAKE THIS AS- STRONG AS WE CAN. THANK NEXT WILL FROM SOME PET WITH THE ANALYST'S. THANK YOU DR ANGELA ON YOU PICK FROM THE L. A. O- AS MS FINELLI JUST NOTED THAT THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROPOSAL IS NOT PROVIDED YET THEN WILL OBVIOUSLY REVIEW THAT WHEN IT COMES OUT- AS YOU KNOW OUR OF OUR OFFICE IS ALWAYS A FAN OF GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND MORE INFORMATION- BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL THAT WE AGREES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION. SO FIRST- WHY IS THIS FUNDING BEING DIRECTED TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS RATHER THAN ALLOWING HOSPITALS TO FUND OTHER PROJECTS THAT ALSO FOCUS ON SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH- SECOND HOW WILL IT BE TO BE DETERMINED WHETHER A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION PROJECT IS RELATED TO SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH- THE THIRD HOW MUCH FUNDING DOES THE ADMINISTRATION EXPECT WILL BE DIRECTED TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. IF THIS PROPOSAL IS APPROVED. AND FINALLY WHAT SPECIFIC CONDITIONS WOULD TRIGGER A PENALTY A FINANCIAL PENALTY AGAINST THE HOSPITAL- IF THEY DON'T ADHERE TO THE PROPOSED REQUIREMENTS- THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE TYPES OF DETAILS THAT WE WILL WE ARE HOPING WILL. BE ADDRESSED BY THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT WE HAVE DOCTOR KEVIN BARNETT PROGRAM DIRECTOR FOR THE CENTER TO ADVANCE COMMUNITY HEALTH AND EQUITY WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE. THANK YOU. I'D LIKE TO SHARE A FEW SLIDES WITH YOU IF ONLINE. GOOD AFTERNOON I'D LIKE TO PROVIDE A BIT OF THE OF THE MATERIAL THAT WE COVERED IN THE BRIEF- THAT WAS JUST REFERENCE THAT WAS PUBLISHED- A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE FOCUSING ON BOTH SOME OF THE CHALLENGES AND THE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. FIRST AND FOREMOST- IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THEM AS WAS TOUCHED ON IN THE OPENING PRESENTATION- THIS IS FOLLOWING A LONG STRING OF EFFORTS BOTH AT THIS AT THE STATE LEVEL AND AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO LEGISLATE. HOW NONPROFIT HOSPITALS MEET THEIR TRIP WHAT LOCATIONS- IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE REAL STARTING POINT FOR THE SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY NINE. THE IRISH RULING THAT. BUT THAT BASICALLY OUTLINED THE CONCEPT OF THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH EXPANDING BEYOND THE PROVISION OF CHARITY CARE FOR NONPROFIT HOSPITALS. TO THE BROADER PUBLIC HEALTH- PURPOSE THAT WE ARE DISCUSSING TODAY- A LOT OF STATUTES IN BETWEEN CALIFORNIA'S THAT THE SIX NINETY SEVEN AND NINETY FOUR- AS REFERENCED EARLIER TO OUR BOTH THE IRS REVISED GUIDELINES IN THE PORTABLE CARE ACT. FIVE A ONE ARE PROVIDING OF A VARIETY OF MORE DETAILED REQUIREMENTS HOWEVER I WOULD NOTE THAT MANY OF THOSE REQUIREMENTS IF ANYTHING HAVE ADDED CONFUSION RATHER THAN CLARITY TO HELP NONPROFIT HOSPITALS. MEET THESE OBLIGATIONS AND THEN A NUMBER OF EFFORTS AND ENDS IN OTHER STATES AS WELL AS IN OUR OWN STATE BOTH CURRENT CREATES A FOCUS ON EQUITY AND TO PROVIDE MORE DETAIL. EXPECTATIONS WITH OBSTACLES- MUCH OF THIS- WORK AS REALLY JUST FOCUSED ON HOW MUCH HOSPITALS ARE PROVIDED RATHER THAN REALLY DIGGING INTO THE QUALITY OF THE INVESTMENTS AND TO THE DEGREE TO WHICH WE REALLY FOCUSED. ON THE PROFOUND INEQUITIES THAT WE HAVE IN OUR CANDIDATES- WHEN YOU LOOK AT MOST EXPENDITURES INCLUDING. MEDICAID SHORTFALLS IN HEALTH PROFESSIONS EDUCATION EXPENDITURES BY HOSPITAL'S CURRENT SPENDING ON SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH IS QUITE SMALL SO THE PROPOSAL ONE OF THE FACE OF IT IS IT IS AN IMPORTANT. MOMENT IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION PARTICULARLY GIVEN THAT HOSPITALS ARE ASSEMBLY INCREASING RATES FOR KEEPING. PEOPLE HEALTHY AND OUT OF THEIR INSTITUTIONS- IT'S OF TO. HOWEVER THAT IF IT NUMBER OF WHAT IS WRITTEN. FOR EXAMPLE WE THE FORM MEDICARE OUR- SHORTFALL AND INPATIENT TREATMENT OF PREVENTABLE CONDITION. SO BEGINNING TO MATURE SHIFT INVESTMENTS UPSTREAM IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. HOWEVER AMONG THE MANY CHALLENGES IN IMPLEMENTING THIS KIND OF LEGISLATION AS UNDERSTANDING THE PROFOUND DIVERSITY OF THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR ITSELF. SAFETY NET HOSPITALS IN PARTICULAR IN OUR URBAN SETTINGS HOW MUCH LESS FAVORABLE PAYER METHODS THANK HAD A LARGER PERCENTAGE OF PUBLIC PAY OF PATIENTS THAT HAVE LOWER MARGINS OF THEY HAVE A LOT MORE LOW INCOME PEOPLE IN THEIR EMERGENCY ROOMS. AND MAKES IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM WHILE THEY HAVE GREATER SENSITIVITY THE MANY CHALLENGES FACED BY THESE POPULATIONS THEY HAVE THE LEAST DISCRETIONARY- REVENUE TO BE ABLE TO ALLOCATE FOR THESE PURPOSES SO WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION. TEACHING HOSPITALS- OF SPEND A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF THEIR COMMITTEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS- IT IN QUATERNARY AND TERTIARY CARE FOR THIS POPULATION AS WELL AS HEALTH PROFESSIONS EDUCATION SHORTFALLS. SEVERAL HOSPITALS HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF THEIR VERY LIMITED MARGINS DIRECTED TOWARDS DIRECT SERVICES SUBSIDIZED SERVICES DENTAL SERVICES- OF BIRD WARDS OVER AN ARRAY OF SPECIALTY CARE IT WOULD OTHERWISE BE UNAVAILABLE FOR THOSE POPULATIONS. IT HAS ALREADY BEEN REFERENCE THERE'S IN THE METALAC OF CLARITY IN THE CURRENT IRS REPORTING CATEGORIES A LOT OF THINGS ARE REPORTED THAT PROBABLY SHOULDN'T MANY OTHERS ARE NOT REPORTED BECAUSE THERE'S A LACK OF CLARITY ABOUT WHERE THEY BELONG. SO TO THE DEGREE THAT ANY PROPOSAL SUCH AS THIS IS A PLUMMETED REQUIRES SOME SOME RIGOROUS EFFORT TO STRENGTHEN THE REPORTING CATEGORIES- THEN IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT TO THE DEGREE THAT WE REQUIRE SPENDING IN SOME AREAS IT MAY CHALLENGE THOSE FOR NON EMERGENT CARE. FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THE LIFE OF THIS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TIME IT PUTS AN ADDITIONAL. STRAIN ON HOSPITALS TO PROVIDE THE AS- THAT HAVING BEEN SAID- ALTHOUGH OF OFFER ARE PRETTY- WHAT WE HEARD FROM OUR CALLING NATURE L. L. IT TRYING THE IN MOVING TOWARD A TOP FOUR TO THIS OF THE THAT IT WILL INCLUDE COMMITTEE BUILDING WHICH THE IRS ALLOW FISH AGENT OR AGENCY DECLARED THIS IS A PRIORITY ENABLES US TO SPEND QUITE A BIT MORE IN THAT AREA. H. BECAUSE I HAVE A WEALTH OF DATA- THAT WE COULD- PUT UNDER G. I. S. ANALYSIS- AND BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY SUB GEOGRAPHIES WHERE THERE'S A HIGH RATE OF PREVENTABLE BDNF PATIENT UTILIZATION WHAT WE'VE DONE IS ANALYSES IN IN OTHER STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY WE HAVE RATES OF PREVENTABLE ET IN THE PATIENT WAS ELECTIONS THAT ARE FREE FOUR SOMETIMES TEN TIMES HIGHER THAN THE COUNTY AVERAGES SO IT'S QUITE CLEAR WHERE WE CAN DIRECT- BECAUSE THE MASSIVE SUPPORT THOUGHTFUL- THIS IS ABLE TO START REALLY FUNDAMENTALLY SHIFT OUR FOCUS ON EQUITY- CREATING- INATTENTIVE. FOR ABOUT COMMUNITIES TO FOCUS WHERE THEY NEED TO- AND TO- AND IMMOBILIZER ASSETS IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES THIS IS- WE SEE EFFORTS FOR EXAMPLE WERE WORKING. WITH THE L. A. PARTNERSHIP. AND THE COMMITTEE TO COME CENTER THE MORE INTO. ALL THE HOSPITAL TO THE GROUP DEFO. ON THE ISSUE OF. AND A LOOK AT AND TO LET. THEIR RAP IN COMBAT. THIS IS- THIS IS AN EXAM OF A OF A THE WITH CDC. THAT ENABLES US TO SEE WHERE HOSPITALS ARE LOCATED. WHERE ARE THEIR CONCENTRATIONS OF SIGNIFICANT POVERTY AND CHALLENGE AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH HOSPITALS ARE CORRECTING THEIR RESOURCES IN THOSE SUBJECTS ARE PERFECT WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY NOW. IN CALIFORNIA AND WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH EACH TRY TO GET THESE BIG DATA AND FINDING OUT THERE TO SUPPORT. THE KIND OF LEVERAGE INVESTMENT THAT WE NEED. SO IF I THE PROPOSAL FROM FROM H. TRY- IT IS IN LINE WITH A MORE DELIBERATE APPROACH TO THIS PROCESS FOR THE FIRST STEP IN THE PROCESS THE STAFF WAS COMMON DEFINITIONS AND RULES FOR REPORTING. CAL SHOULD STATE DATABASE A DATABASE FOR TARGETED REPORTING. UP TO MAKE SURE THERE'S AN IMPLICIT ADVISORY STRUCTURE- AND TO REALLY ESTABLISH THE KIND OF INCENTIVES WE NEED FOR VOLUNTEERS LEADERSHIP- OUT OF SEPARATE TOPIC- THIS BODY TODAY WE'LL BE DISCUSSING. OF THE EQUITY FUND. THE PROPOSAL TO ESTABLISH A HUNDRED MILLION FOR AN EQUITY FUND OF THE STATE OF THIS I THINK CALIFORNIA'S IS. IS FAR SMALLER THAN IS NEEDED- PUTTING A FUNDED ET AL IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF A BILLION DOLLARS WOULD MAKE A LOT MORE SENSE AND COULD BE USED AS LEVERAGE. WITH HOSPITAL MATCHES TO THOSE FUNDS IN. THE VERY COMMUNITIES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. SO WHAT IT TOOK TO PUT SOME KEEP. REPORTER BODY I COULD TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT IS. THE CHALLENGES HOSPITALS BUT LOOK AT WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN PARTNER WITH THEM TO REALLY ADDRESS THE FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGES MARCH UNITS THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM KAREN SAVAGE SANGWAN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK. GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY- I WANT TO START OUT BY THANKING THE DEPARTMENT THE LEGISLATURE IN ALL OF OUR LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH LEADERS AND FRONTLINE WORKERS FOR THEIR TREMENDOUS WORK DURING THE PANDEMIC. WHICH IS NOT OVER YET AND WE KNOW THAT HER OAK WORK WILL CONTINUE- TO SPEAK TO THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS PROPOSAL SO CURRENTLY AS WAS MENTIONED BY THE LA- WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SEE TRAILER BILL AND SO THERE'S- NOT SUFFICIENT DETAIL FOR US TO FULLY WEIGH IN ON THAT. HOWEVER SEE PENN DOES BELIEVE THAT THE PROPOSAL AS PRESENTED HAS MERIT. CURRENTLY ONLY THREE CENTS OF EVERY DOLLAR SPENT ON HEALTHCARE IS SPENT ON PREVENTION. WE MUST CHANGE THIS EQUATION IN ORDER TO ADVANCE HEALTH EQUITY AND EASE THE BURDEN OF CHRONIC DISEASE AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. BETTER DIRECTING THE RESOURCES OF NONPROFIT HOSPITALS WHICH DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL BENEFIT FROM THEIR TAX STATUS. TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY HEALTH AND ADVANCE THE PRIORITIES OF THE STATE FOR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF THIS PUZZLE. E DO SUPPORT REFORMING COMMUNITY BENEFITS STANDARDS AND ENSURING THAT TAXPAYER DOLLARS A CHEAP IMPACT FOR MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES. THAT SAID THAT PROPOSAL ALONE IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO ADVANCE HEALTH EQUITY AND RACIAL JUSTICE. IT MUST BE PAIRED WITH THE GENERAL FUND INVESTMENT IN HEALTH EQUITY AND RACIAL JUSTICE. I WAS WAS INCLUDED IN THE LEGISLATURE'S BUDGET LAST YEAR AT THE HEALTH EQUITY AND RACIAL JUSTICE FUNDS WHICH WE APPRECIATE. PUBLIC HEALTH DOES NOT START AND END UP THE DOORS OF GOVERNMENT AND NEITHER DOES RACIAL JUSTICE IN FACT IN ORDER TO BUILD AND SUSTAIN HEALTHY COMMUNITIES. WE MUST HAVE SHARED OWNERSHIP LEADERSHIP AND ACCOUNTABILITY. COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS OR THOSE WHOSE MISSION IT IS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF HISTORICALLY EXCLUDED COMMUNITIES. MUST BE A PART OF OUR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS PLAY THREE CRITICAL ROLES IN ADVANCING PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS REDUCING DISPARITIES AND PROMOTING RACIAL JUSTICE. THEY MAKE THE INVISIBLE VISIBLE THEY BUILD BRIDGES AND THE INNOVATE TO TRANSFORM SYSTEMS TO ALIGN WITH COMMUNITY NEEDS AND PRIORITIES. FIRST ON MAKING THE INVISIBLE VISIBLE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS HAVE ARISEN OUT OF UNMET NEED OFTEN IN THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MADE INVISIBLE BY OUR SYSTEMS AND PRACTICES DUE TO THEIR SIZE OR LACK OF POLITICAL POWER. FOR EXAMPLE DURING THE PANDEMIC PACIFIC ISLANDERS EXPERIENCED THE HIGHEST CASE AND DEATH RATES OF ANY RACIAL GROUP. YET DUE TO THE SMALL SIZE OF THE POPULATION AND IT'S DISBURSING H. R. TRAP CALIFORNIA LITTLE WITH READY TO RESPOND TO THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. IN RESPONSE PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS MOBILIZED AND BUILT A STATEWIDE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ADVOCATED FOR THEIR NEEDS. PARTNERED WITH STATE AND COUNTY EFFORTS DISABILITY TO TESTING VACCINATION AND PP DISTRIBUTION PROVIDED CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE PUBLIC EDUCATION. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY PROVIDED HOPE DURING A PERIOD OF ISOLATION AND FEAR. SECOND ON BUILDING BRIDGES COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE ABLE TO HAVE A FOOT IN EACH WORLD AND TO NAVIGATE BETWEEN THE STRUCTURES OF GOVERNMENT AND THE REALITIES OF COMMUNITIES. UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITIES WERE PARTICULARLY DEVASTATED BY THE PANDEMIC BUT ALSO ISOLATED FROM THE RESOURCES OF GOVERNMENT DUE TO FEAR OF IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES. COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE STUDENTS GAP ACTING AS TRUSTED MESSENGERS TO BRING PP FINANCIAL RELIEF AND OTHER RESOURCES TO UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITIES. ALLOWING LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL AND STATE PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORTS TO REACH THOSE WHO OTHERWISE MAY HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT. FINALLY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY ON INNOVATING TO TRANSFORM SYSTEMS TO ALIGN WITH COMMUNITY PRIORITIES. AFTER THE LAST TWO YEARS I THINK IT IS CLEAR TO ALL OF US WHO VALUE EQUITY. THAT WE CANNOT GO BACK TO HER PRE PANDEMIC NORMAL. INSTEAD WE MUST INNOVATE AND TRANSFORM TO ELIMINATE RACIAL AND OTHER INEQUITIES COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS HOLD SYSTEMS ACCOUNTABLE. ENSURE PARTICIPATION IN DEMOCRACY AND DEVELOP NEW AND CREATIVE IDEAS TO SOLVE SEEMINGLY INTRACTABLE SOCIETAL PROBLEMS. IT IS THIS ROLE THAT WE WANT TO SUPPORT THROUGH THE RACIAL JUSTICE INNOVATION PORTION OF THE FUND. WE MUST BE WILLING TO INVEST IN NEW IDEAS AND EXPERIMENTS AND COMMUNITIES IN ORDER TO EFFECT EFFECTIVELY TACKLED THE GENERATIONAL IMPACT OF SYSTEMIC RACISM. BY FILLING THESE THREE CRITICAL ROLES COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS COMPLEMENT AND EXTEND THE REACH OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL AND STATE PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORTS. WHILE MANY LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS RECOGNIZE THIS AND ACTIVELY PARTNER WITH CBO'S AS YOU WILL HEAR FROM THE NEXT SPEAKER. IT IS AN UNFORTUNATE REALITY THAT NOT ALL LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THEIR BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS TO DO SO. THERE COUNTIES IN THE STATE WHERE PROPOSED INVESTMENTS IN PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITIES COULD NOT BE APPROVED AND OTHERS THAT HAVE REVOKED FUNDING FOR COPING OUT REACH TO VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THEIR CONTRACTORS ALSO SUPPORT THE BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENT. IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE TO FILL THESE GAPS AND ENSURE THAT ALL COMMUNITIES HAVE ACCESS TO RESOURCES. AND ARE ABLE TO BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE TO ADVANCE HEALTH EQUITY AND JUSTICE. THE HEALTH EQUITY AND RACIAL JUSTICE FUND HAS STRONG ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS BUILT IN TO ENSURE IMPACT. WE URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO ONCE AGAIN INCLUDE THIS INVESTMENT IN THE BUDGET. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM DR MOON TO DAVIS THE HEALTH OFFICER FOR LOS ANGELES COUNTY PLEASE BEGIN. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU I'M DOCTOR MORE INTO DAVIS THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY HEALTH OFFICER. THANK YOU COMMITTEE CHAIR ARAMBULA AND AUDIBLE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY ON BEHALF OF ALL SAN ANGELES COUNTY AND IN SUPPORT OF THE HEALTH EQUITY AND RACIAL JUSTICE ON. RESHAPED ADMINISTRATION'S ONGOING COMMIT THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND THINK THE LEGISLATOR FOR LEGISLATURE FOR THEIR EFFORTS. LAST YEAR TO DIRECT A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION IN FUNDING TO SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. LOS ANGELES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH IS PROUD TO JOIN OVER TWO HUNDRED ADVOCATES AND ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE STATE TO URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THE CRITICAL REQUEST FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN ONGOING FUNDING TO ENABLE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. CLERICS AND TRIBAL ORGANIZATIONS TO ADVANCE INITIATIVES THAT FOCUS ON RACIAL AND SOCIAL JUSTICE AS PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING ACROSS ALL OF CALIFORNIA. SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE COUNTY CENTER FOR HEALTH EQUITY. HAVE WORKS TO AUGMENT EXISTING AND EMERGING COMMUNITY EFFORTS STRENGTHEN AND CREATE NEW PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN THE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND COMMUNITY EFFORTS AND REALIGNED APARTMENT RESOURCES TO SUPPORT PARTNERSHIPS THAT ADVANCE CONDITIONS FOR OPTIMAL HEALTH. CRITICAL TO OUR RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC WAS CREATING VERY LOS ANGELES OUR COMMUNITY EQUITY FUND TO SUPPORT THIRTY ONE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO DO WHAT THEY DO BEST. CONNECTING RESIDENTS ENGAGING IN POLICY AND PRACTICE CHANGES ENSURING VITAL INFORMATION ON RISK AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVED HEALTH OUTCOMES. MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SERVICE LINKAGES WERE MADE TO SUPPORT FOOD ACCESS FINANCIAL HELP AND HEALTH CARE NEEDS AND THOUSANDS OF ADDITIONAL OUTREACH EVENTS OUTREACH AN ESTIMATED THREE MILLION PEOPLE. L. A. COUNTY ALSO INVESTED IN THE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS OUTREACH INITIATIVE TO SHARE ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT KOBE NINETEEN AND BACKS THE NATION'S IN A MANNER THAT IS TAILORED TO THE NEEDS OF THOSE MOST IMPACTED BY THE VIRUS. THE INITIATIVE SUPPORTED FIFTEEN ORGANIZATIONS THAT THE POINT OVER FIVE HUNDRED COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS AND CONDUCTED MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND OUTREACH ACTIVITIES HELPING TO REACH AN ESTIMATED THREE POINT TWO MILLION PEOPLE LOS ANGELES COUNTY. WHEN THE DEPARTMENT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AS SUCCESSFUL IN ENGAGING WITH THE COMMUNITY IN THIS WAY GIVE AN UNDERSTANDABLE LACK OF TRUST IN GOVERNMENT THE RESPONSE. AND CBO'S INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF BARRIERS AND SOLUTIONS TO PROMOTING HEALTH IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES. AS YOU KNOW BLACK LATIN ACTS NATIVE HAWAIIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA NATIVE POPULATIONS CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE THE DYSPORT AN IMPACT FROM THE PANDEMIC. DUE IN LARGE PART TO LONGSTANDING STRUCTURAL AND SYSTEMIC INEQUITIES INCLUDING EMPLOYMENT. OVERCROWDED HOUSING. IRATE SOME UNDERLYING HEALTH CONDITIONS AND A LACK OF STRONG WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS. FOR HEALTH EQUITY AND RACIAL JUSTICE FUND WOULD ALLOW COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS IN L. A. COUNTY AND ACROSS THE STATE TO ADDRESS HELP HELP THE SEVERITY. AND DISEASE DISEASES IMPACTING VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. SENATE PROTECTIONS AND WORKERS RIGHTS WE URGE YOU TO INVEST IN THE HEALTH EQUITY AND RACIAL JUSTICE FINE AS WE WORK COLLECTIVELY TO COME BACK STRONGER POST PANDEMIC WHICH AGAIN WERE NOTAT YET WE NEED A SUSTAINED COMMITMENT TO SUPPORT COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS ACROSS ALL SECTORS TO CLOSE THE AVOIDABLE AND UNACCEPTABLE GAPS IN HEALTH AND WELL BEING ACROSS RACIAL ETHNIC AND SOCIOECONOMIC GROUPS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM HEAVEN EAST LOS WHO IS THE FOUNDER AND CEO OF CULTIVAR LAWCENTER PLEASE BEGIN. GOOD AFTERNOON BONUS THAT THIS COMMITTEE CHAIRED UNPLANNED COMMITTEE MEMBERS SIGNED HIM OVER BY YOU SLICE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE BALLOT THAT LOOT I AM A PROUD NEED OF A FRESNO WHICH IS YOUR KIDS LANDED ALSO THE DAUGHTER AND GRANDDAUGHTER OF FARM NEIGHBORS. WITH EVEN LESS THAN WHAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE AS AN INITIATIVE TO ADDRESS CHRONIC ILLNESS AMONG VULNERABLE POPULATIONS THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY SPECIFICALLY OUR WORK BEGAN IN RESPONSE TO THE ONGOING OBESITY EPIDEMIC OUR EFFORTS HAVE FOCUSED ON IMPROVING ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOODS AND PROMOTING INVESTMENTS TO CREATE SAFE PLACES FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. MOST RECENTLY WE HAVE BEEN VERY INVOLVED IN RESPONDING TO COVERED BY OFFERING FOOD AND SUPPLIES TO POOR AND DOCUMENTED WOMEN PROVIDING HEALTH EDUCATION AND OUTREACH TO LATINO IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS HOSTING TESTING AND VACCINE EVENTS IN RURAL COMMUNITIES. ARE PROMOTED AS HAVE CONNECTED PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HARDSHIP DUE TO KOBE TO RESOURCES SUCH AS EMPLOYEE RIGHTS UTILITY ASSISTANCE ANTI DICTION SUPPORTS AS WELL AS ISOLATION AND QUARANTINE SUPPORTS. THEY HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEIR COMMUNITY THEY SPEAK THEIR LANGUAGE THEY UNDERSTAND THEIR CULTURE AND BECAUSE OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS ALLOW THEM TO ESTABLISH TRUSTING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE MOST VULNERABLE. COMMUNITY RESIDENTS. CURRENTLY UP ABOUT THE HEALTH INEQUITY IN RACIAL IN. ISSUES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY RESIDENTS AGES EIGHTEEN AND OLDER HAS DIABETES FRESNO COUNTY HAS THE SECOND HIGHEST ASTHMA RATE IN THE STATE AT SEVENTEEN PERCENT. THE BATTLE HE HAS HIGH RATES OF HEART DISEASE% DEATHS FROM CANCER INFANT MORTALITY AND LATE ACCESS TO PRENATAL CARE ONE IN SIX VALLEY RESIDENTS IS UNINSURED THE VALLEY HAD. 30% FEWER DOCTORS THAN THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE WITH FORTY SEVEN POINT NINE. PHYSICIANS PER HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE THESE POINTS CLARIFY WHY THE COLBERT PANDEMIC HAS BEEN SUCH A BURDEN IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY THE PREVALENCE OF PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS COUPLED WITH THE LIMITED ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. IS THE PERFECT BREEDING GROUND FOR COAL BUT- OUR VULNERABILITY HOWEVER IS THE STATE'S VULERABILITY THE VALLEY REPRESENTS 1% OF THE AGRICULTURAL FARMLAND IN THE US BUT WE PRODUCE OVER 25% OF ALL THE TABLE FOOD BE. CALIFORNIA'S FOOD SUPPLY LITERALLY DEPENDS ON THE FARMERS AND FARM WORKERS OF THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. THESE DATA POINTS HOWEVER ALSO POINT TO THE IMPORTANCE OF INVESTING IN PREVENTION TO BUILD HEALTHIER AND MORE RESILIENT COMMUNITIES. PROMOTING HEALTH IS NOT SOMETHING YOU DO IN A CRISIS IT'S AN INVESTMENT THAT WE NEED TO CONTRIBUTE TO CONSISTENTLY WE CAN CULTIVATE GOOD HEALTH BUT WE NEED THE RESOURCES TO DO IT. AS I MENTIONED HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE BUT IT'S BEEN ONLY BECAUSE OF MONUMENTAL LINKS TO PIECE TOGETHER FUNDING STREAMS OF THE NONPROFIT. WE GAIN RESOURCES WE BUILT UP STAFF AND THEN THE GRANTS AND THEN WE HAVE TO LET STAFF GO AND SUSPEND ACTIVITIES UNTIL FUNDING CAN BE IDENTIFIED AND SECURED AGAIN. HAVING AN UNSTABLE SOURCE THE FUNDING HAS BEEN DETRIMENTAL TO OUR SUCCESS CHALLENGES OUR VENDORS FOR HEALTH PROJECT THROUGH THIS PROJECT WE PARTNERED WITH OTHER NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO ESTABLISH A COMMUNITY KITCHEN WE TRAINED MOBILE VENDORS- WE TRAIN THEM IN PARTICULAR TO OFFER FRUITS AND VEGETABLES- TO HELP- SPREAD. ACCESS TO HEALTHIER FOODS INCLUDED SECURING NEIGHBORHOODS. AND SO THIS MEANT THAT WE HAD TO WORK WITH THEM SO THAT THEY COULD BE LICENSED AND PERMITTED SO THAT THEY COULD PASS ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH. REQUIREMENTS AND GAIN FOOD HANDLING CERTIFICATION THE PROJECT OPERATED AS A PILOT WITH REALLY GOOD SUCCESS HOWEVER OUR NONPROFIT PARTNER LOST THEIR FUNDING AND ULTIMATELY THE LEASE ON THE KITCHEN. THAT WE HAVE WORK TO ESTABLISH- THE PROJECT COULD NO LONGER OPERATE WITHOUT ACCESS TO A CERTIFIED COMMUNITY KITCHEN AND SO I USE THAT STORY TO DESCRIBE- JUST HOW DIFFICULT IT IS- IN THE NONPROFIT COMMUNITY. TO REALLY SUSTAIN INNOVATIVE PROJECTS THAT HAVE A LOT OF PROMISE. IN THE PAST TWO YEARS- WE HAVE HAD TO FIGHT FOR FUNDING WITH KERIS ACT IN ORDER TO RESPOND TO THE NEEDS IN PARTICULAR IMMIGRANT AND REFUGEE COMMUNITY MEMBER CENTER COALBED. WE ARE HAVING ALSO TO FIGHT FOR FUNDING FOR ARPA AT WE'VE BEEN DENIED FUNDING MANY TIMES BECAUSE OF LOCAL POLITICS HI THIS IS TRUE IN MANY OF THE COUNTIES HERE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY WHERE THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS DO NOT REFLECT. THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHICH WE ARE TRYING TO SERVE. AND NO ONE'S HEALTH SHOULD REALLY BE UNDERMINED BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HOLD THIS POLITICAL POWER- AND IN THE ABSENCE OF EQUITABLE REPRESENTATION IN THESE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WE NEED TO BE MORE EQUITABLE IN THE WAY THAT FUNDING AND RESOURCES ARE DISTRIBUTED. SO WITH STEADY FUNDING TO PROMOTE HEALTH EQUITY AND RACIAL JUSTICE COULD BE BY LESS THAN WHO COULD. ENSURE THAT WE HAVE LONG TERM EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES WITH COMPETITIVE WAGES AMPLE BENEFITS WE COULD SUSTAIN INTERVENTIONS THAT REALLY HELP TO CHANGE THE FOOD LANDSCAPE. INCLUDED SECURE NEIGHBORHOODS WE COULD DIVE DEEPER IN ADVOCACY- TO BRING THE NECESSARY AND INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS THAT PROMOTE DALY IN REGULAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WE COULD CONTINUE IN OUR LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES THAT ALLOW DISADVANTAGE. I RESIDENTS TO BE AGENTS FOR CHANGE- WE COULD HELP TO PROMOTE PREVENTION WE COULD HELP TO ESTABLISH HEALTHY COMMUNITIES AND WE COULD DEFINITELY HAVE A GREATER IMPACT. AND HEALTH EQUITY. AND IT WOULD ENSURE THAT MY GRANDCHILDREN AND GREAT COME CHILDREN AS WELL AS YOURS HAVE AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE THE FULL COURSE OF THEIR LIVES AN OPTIMAL OUT. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING FOR AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE ASKING- FOR THIS HEALTH EQUITY IN RACIAL JUSTICE FUND TO BE ESTABLISHED AND FOR THE DOLLARS TO BE EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED TO NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS MINE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WITH THAT I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE D√çAS TO SEE IF ANY MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS. SEEING NINE I WILL KEEP IT WITH THE CHAIR AND I WILL TAKE A- MOMENT OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE AND REALLY APPRECIATE THAT I EAST LOS WHO I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH DURING THIS LAST PANDEMIC. IT WAS JUST ABOUT A YEAR AGO THAT SHE AND I WERE WORKING ON THE FRONT LINES IN PLACES LIKE ORANGE COVE. DELRAY AND BY ALL WHICH HAPPENS TO BE THE MOST VACCINATED. SMALL CITY UNINCORPORATED CITY WE HAD AN FRESNO COUNTY IT COULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED WITHOUT THE PARTNERSHIP OF THOSE. CBO'S WHO ARE THE TRUSTED MESSENGERS ON THE GROUND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE DO APPRECIATE YOU ABOUT THE- AND ALL THE HARD WORK THE ORGANIZATION THIS TIME. WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO TURN MY FIRST QUESTION TO THE ADMINISTRATION. IT SEEMS THAT- SUSAN FINALE HAD SAID THAT WE NEED BETTER TRANSPARENCY REGARDING THESE DOLLARS THAT WE NEED TO SEE MORE OF A COLLECTIVE IMPACT ON THE GROUND THAT I'D FIRST LIKE TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION IF THEY BELIEVE ANYTHING IS CURRENTLY MISSING. FROM THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS PROGRAM FUNDING. AND AND IF SO- CAN YOU IDENTIFY WHAT THAT IS. I THINK I'LL I'LL START AND I'LL TURN IT BACK TO SCOTT BUT I THINK WE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT GIVEN THAT THAT THAT DATA IS NOT GRANULAR ENOUGH FOR US TO SEE HOW MUCH IS INVESTED IN WHICH AREAS WE KNOW THAT WE ARE NOT INVESTING IN SOME OF THE HIGHEST RISK AREAS AND WE KNOW THAT NOT ALL HOSPITALS ARE ENGAGING COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS SO SETTING UP OUR OF 25% TO GO TO DIRECTLY TO CEOS. TO GET THAT TRUSTED MESSENGER TO GET TO THOSE COMMUNITIES MOST AT RISK BUT I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE TRANSPARENCY ISSUE IS WE WANT TO SEE EXACTLY HOW MUCH AS BEING ABOUT SEVEN WHERE AND SOME OF THE REPORTS THAT WE HAVE DON'T GO TO THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL. NOT SCOTT IF YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING MORE FINANCES I WANT TO THANK YOU SUIT JUST JUST IT TOOK TO REPORT THAT'S CORRECT IT'S ESSENTIALLY WE DON'T KNOW WE DON'T KNOW THE NATURE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLANS REPORTED IN CALIFORNIA TODAY ARE ARE ESSENTIALLY QUALITATIVE- THERE'S NO STANDARDIZED REQUIRED FORMAT SO IN SOME CASES- THERE WELL FLESHED OUT AND WE CAN WE CAN SEE WHERE THESE THESE- THESE BENEFITS ARE BEING SPENT OTHER CASES WE CAN'T. THEY'RE NOT COMPARABLE ACROSS THE WEEK WE CAN'T DO ANY COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS UP REALLY THE FIRST PIECE OF THIS IS THIS TO DO STANDARDIZED STRUCTURED REPORTING ON CATEGORIES THAT WE DEFINE TOGETHER- THROUGH RULE MAKING PROCESS- TO GET IT THOSE THINGS- TO KNOW WHERE THE INVESTMENTS ARE AGAIN FROM READING ALL OF THE REPORTS. AS A STUDENT SAID IN SOME CASES WE THINK SOME OF THIS IS HAPPENING TODAY BUT WE CAN'T QUANTIFY AND I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE TO GET OUT IN TERMS OF TRANSPARENCY IN IT AND ALLOWING THE COMMUNITY TO BE CLEAR. ON WHAT IS HAPPENING WHAT'S NOT HAPPENING. I WILL STAY CALL. WITHOUT NEEDING. NUMBER BUT- ALL. YOU SAID THE WERE SIX BILLION. FOR COMMUNITY BAND FOR THE HOSPITAL AND THAT FOUR BILLION OF THAT GOES INTO UNCOMPENSATED CARE. WITH THE SIGNIFICANT EXPANSIONS THAT ARE EXPECTED FROM US AS A STATE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS WHAT DO WE ANTICIPATE TO HAPPEN. WITH UNCOMPENSATED. CARE AND DO WE EXPECT IT TO CONTINUE TO BE FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN THE UPCOMING YEARS. IT ALL START TO THAT SB IS IT KIND OF DEMONSTRATES HOW DIFFICULT IS COULD NUMBERS THOSE THOSE DATA WERE ACTUALLY TAKEN FROM FEDERAL TAX RETURNS THAT WE YOU KNOW WE THINK THAT THAT WAS ACCURATE AND IN TWENTY NINETEEN IT WASN'T- FULLY. CAPTURING THE UNDERSTAND IN IN- OF MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SO WE WOULD EXPECT I THINK FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE FOR A SORT OF MORAL TO YOUR ACCOUNT IF YOU'RE A CALCULATED WITHIN THE MANY BENEFITS. OF THE SCHEME SO I THINK I WOULD I WOULD START THERE AND- YEAH I KNOW I ADD THE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THERE'S NO MINIMUM. AMOUNT BENEFITS PROMISED INVEST IN THEIR COMMUNITY BENEFITS SO BECAUSE WE'RE NOT INCLUDING UNCOMPENSATED CARE IN THE FORMULA. IT WOULDN'T CHANGE THE INVESTMENTS POTENTIALLY THAT PEOPLE ARE MAKING. FUN WE DON'T KNOW THAT. I THINK WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS IF THE LEVEL OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE IS NOW LOWER SINCE WERE COVERING MORE INDIVIDUALS. IS THERE ARE MORE RESOURCES FOR US TO BE DISCUSSING. THAT THEN WILL BE AVAILABLE AT. I WOULD SAY YES I THINK THE QUESTION IS THAT THE LATE INTO MORE INVESTMENT CAN. THIS IS. NOT THAT. I WILL TRY TO ANY. SURE. THE FACT THAT. TO TRY JUST TODAY. THE EXTRA BUCKS TO HAVE CONFIDENCE PROPOSAL I HAVE SPECIFIC CRITERIA SOME TELEPHONE THE HOSPITAL'S TRACKING. SURE STORE. SURE. THAT AT. AT BEST. BUT IN. SO THE STANDARD REPORT. BASED ON THAT. I'M GOING TO LOG OFF AND LOG BACK IN AND SEE IF THAT HELPS THAT SOUNDS GREAT- I WILL REITERATE I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S ON YOUR AND IT'S WE NEED TO FIGURE IT OUT ON THE SIDE BUT OKAY- HAPPY TO GIVE YOU THAT% SPACE AS WELL OKAY. OKAY LET ME JUST TRY IT. THANK YOU. GIPSON. I GOT A TEXT THAT IT STARTED ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AGO YEAH DECEMBER TWENTY. BEFORE THE. I GOT A HEARING SERVING CAME BACK BACK IN. I CAN HEAR YOU LOUDLY AND CLEARLY AND LET'S HOPE IT WORKS IF YOU WANT TO BEGIN DOCTOR GOT. OKAY I'LL START OVER AGAIN YOU MIGHT HAVE TO PUT ME ON SPEAKER- OF THE PANEL SO THAT YOU CAN SEE ME YOU CAN. SEE VIDEO OTHERWISE I'LL GO AHEAD AND JUST THE- REQUESTED. AS SOON AS YOU BEGIN SPEAKING WE SHOULD APPEAR. HELLO KATHY OKAY HOPEFULLY THANK OUT TAKING CARE OF THEM TO GO AHEAD JUST ALL START OVER AGAIN. I'M STOP AMP REALLY ARE HERE TO BE PRESENTING ON THE FOUNDATION THE FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH OVER THE PAST DECADES PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO PROTECT THE INTENT OF PROVIDING HEALTH WELL BEING AND QUALITY OF LIFE. FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA HOWEVER WE NOW FACE SOME OF THE BIGGEST THREATS TO HUMAN HEALTH. CALIFORNIA FACES NUMEROUS PUBLIC HEALTH CHALLENGES WHICH IMPACT OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND AMPLIFY SOCIAL INEQUITIES THESE CHALLENGES WILL INCREASE THE SCALE SCOPE AND SEVERITY. OUR POPULATION IS GROWING AS WELL AS THEY JEAN WE SEE THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE INCLUDING DROUGHT WILDFIRES HEAT WAVES IMPORTER QUALITY. ECONOMIC DISPARITIES AND SOCIAL DISPLACEMENT INTENSIFIED STRESS AND ANXIETY WE ARE WITNESSING AN ESCALATION OF BEHAVIOR HEALTH CONCERNS INCLUDING ISOLATION TRAUMA AND ADDICTION. OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS THE COBIT NINETEEN PANDEMIC UNLEASHED PROFOUND AND DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES ON THE ESPECIALLY OUR MOST VULNERABLE. THE PANDEMIC ALSO HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED FOR ADEQUATE INVESTMENTS IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND EXPOSE SIGNIFICANT GAPS IN THE ABILITY OF CV PH. A LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS TO RESPOND RAPIDLY AND SUSTAINABLY TO THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS. FOR DECADES THE LEVEL OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC HEALTH AT THE NATIONAL STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW WHAT IS NEEDED FOR AN EQUITABLE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM THAT CAN KEEP CALIFORNIA'S HEALTHY AND SAFE. CITY PH NOW HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEVERAGE PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACHES TO SHAPE AN EQUITABLE RECOVERY AND ADDRESS THE FULL RANGE OF FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE A PERSON'S OVERALL HEALTH AND WELL BEING. NEW AND EXISTING POPULATION HEALTH CONCERNS HAVE HEIGHTENED THE IMPORTANCE OF INVESTING IN A MODERNIZE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM FOCUSING ON PROTECTION PREVENTION AND PREPAREDNESS. THIS INVESTMENT ENABLES US TO NOT ONLY BUILD BACK BETTER BUT BUILT BACK MORE EQUITABLY LEAVING NO COMMUNITY BEHIND. THE FOUNDATION FOR THE FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH PROPOSAL WILL BUILD CALIFORNIA'S TWENTY FIRST CENTURY PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM. THAT IDENTIFIES CORE GOVERNMENTAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND FOUNDATIONAL FOUNDATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE INVOLVEMENT CAPABLE OF MEETING CURRENT AND FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH NEEDS. CDPH REQUEST FOUR HUNDRED AND FOUR POSITIONS AND GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY OF THREE HUNDRED MILLION ANNUALLY TO MODERNIZE CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEMS. OF THESE RESOURCES TWO HUNDRED POINT FOUR MILLION WITH SUPPORT CALIFORNIANS SIXTY ONE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS AND NINETY NINE POINT SIX MILLION WOULD SUPPORT STATEWIDE PUBLIC HEALTH PRIORITY THE CDPH. CALIFORNIA STATE GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIRE SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENTS IN SIX FOUNDATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE AREAS THE FIRST WHAT IS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND RECRUITMENT. BUT THIS IS THE FOCUS ON IMPROVING OUR CAPACITY AND ABILITY TO RECRUIT RETAIN RETAIN AND DEVELOP A DIVERSE WORKFORCE. THE CITY PAGE PLAN INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY POSITIONS AND FIFTY EIGHT MILLION TO INCREASE TRAFFIC CAPACITY TO ATTRACT DEVELOP AND RETAIN THIS PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE. IT INCLUDES- INITIATIVES SUCH AS THE STUBBLE SEEN OUR FIRST OFFICE OF POLICY AND PLANNING STRENGTHENING OUR PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT- A CAPABILITIES FOCUSING ON LEAN METHODS TO DELIVER RESULTS IN ELIMINATE WASTE. ESTABLISHING A REGIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICE TO SPECIALLY MADE THE PUBLIC HEALTH NEEDS OF A LOT OF. YES OF CALIFORNIA TO HELP OUR HAVE PROBLEMS WITH PUBLIC HEALTH RESOURCES. AND STREET OF COURSE STRENGTHENING RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION THE SECOND AREA IS IN EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS OUR RESPONSE. FOCUSING ON IMPROVING OUR CAPACITY TO RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES OF ALL KINDS FROM NATURAL DISASTERS TO INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAKS TO BIOTERRORISM. THE CDPH PLAN INCLUDE SEVENTY SEVEN POSITIONS AND TWENTY SEVEN POINT SIX MILLION FOR A SCALABLE AND SUSTAINABLE STRUCTURE THAT CAN IDENTIFY AND RESPOND EFFECTIVELY. WE WILL DEVELOP A TWENTY FOUR SEVEN INTELLIGENCE HUB WE'RE GOING TO IMPROVE OUR PLANNING TRAINING AND EXERCISES ACROSS THE EXERCISES ACROSS THE STATE. FOR DISASTER WERE REPAIRED PREPARED AS A RESPONSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE WHAT'S CALLED A REGIONAL RESOURCE THE MODEL TO REALLY FACILITATE- THAT UP THE- COORDINATING EFFORT EFFORTS ACROSS THE STATE WITH RESPECT TO THE SEVENTEEN A PUBLIC HEALTH RESOURCES WHEN REQUIRED. AND DEVELOPING OUR FIRST DEDICATED RECOVERY UNIT THE THIRD AREA IS IT DATA SCIENCE AND INFORMATICS THE PLAN INCLUDES THREE POSITIONS AND FEEDS FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS TO EXPAND. OUR CALIFORNIA BIRTH DEFECTS MONITORING PROGRAM A SEPARATE B. C. P. BOB IS BEING SUBMITTED TO FOCUS. ON MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS. THE NEXT AREAS PUBLIC EDUCATION ENGAGEMENT AND BEHAVIORAL CHANGE THIS IS TO IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE DIVERSE PUBLIC AUDIENCES WITH TIMELY SCIENCE BASED. CULTURAL CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE HEALTH INFORMATION. THE CITY PEACE PLAN INCLUDES TWENTY SIX POSITIONS AT FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO ACHIEVE THIS EFFORT. INITIATIVES INCLUDE CREATING A CORE PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNICATION STRATEGY ED. BOLSTERING OUR OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES AND ADEQUATE CAPACITY TO DISSEMINATE COMMUNICATIONS. THE NEXT AREA IS COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS THIS IS TO IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS AND TO CREATE CROSS SECTOR COLLABORATIONS THE CITY PEACE PLAN INCLUDES FIVE POSITIONS AND TWO POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS TO ACHIEVE THIS. INITIATIVES INCLUDE DEVELOPING A COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY AND PLAN AND ALSO A DEDICATED COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PERSONNEL. AND THEN THE LAST AREA IS OUR COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT AND THAT'S TO IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO PARTNER WITH HEALTH SYSTEMS IMPLANTS A COMMUNITY HEALTH EQUITY AND- AN IMPROVEMENT. THE CITY PAGE PLAN INCLUDES TWENTY THREE POSITIONS ARE SIX POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS EFFORT INITIATIVES INCLUDE COMMUNITY HEALTH FINANCING STRATEGIES. DEDICATED COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT TEAM AND ALSO DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING A COORDINATION AROUND BEHAVIORAL MENTAL HEALTH PREVENTION ACROSS THE STATE. THE LOCALS WILL ALSO BE DOING IT WILL ALSO HAVE- SOME. FOCUS AREAS AS WELL INCLUDING A FOCUS ON WORKFORCE EXPANSION WERE 70% OF THE FUNDS WILL BE USED TO HIRE THE STAFF. ALSO FOCUS ON REDUCING HEALTH DISPARITIES WITH A MINIMUM A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS GOING TO EACH HEALTH JURISDICTIONS. AND THEN THE REST OF IT BEING ALLOCATED BASED ON POPULATION DATA POVERTY INDEX AND ALSO UP PROPORTIONS OF THE DIFFERENT RACIAL ETHNIC ETHNICITIES. AND THEN THE OUT OF FOCUS ON DATA COLLECTION AND MONITORING. THAT'S AN OVERVIEW OF THE OF OUR PROPOSAL I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO SUSAN FANELLI CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR POLICY AND PROGRAMS AT CDPH WILL ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE SUBMITTED TO THEM. WHO SERVE. REALLY HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY AS YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN A LONG COUPLE OF YEARS AND- EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO HIRE NEW POSITIONS AND THE FIRST QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE OUR STRATEGY TO ENSURE AN ADEQUATE POOL OF CANDIDATES- WE'VE BEEN. SUCCESSFULLY USING VARIOUS RECRUITMENT PLATFORMS AND POSTING SITES TO RECORD FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PHYSICIANS WILL CONTINUE TO SOURCE RECRUITMENT OPTIONS. THAT REALLY TARGET QUALIFIED CANDIDATES AND EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THOSE VARIOUS RECRUITMENT OPTIONS SUCH AS THE NUMBER OF. CANDIDATES THAT WE GET TO PARTICIPATE IN VIRTUAL RECRUITMENT EVENTS NUMBER OF CANDIDATES THAT APPLIED THROUGH POSTING SITE AND QUALIFICATIONS OF THOSE CANDIDATES. WE'VE CONVENE DEPARTMENT WORKS TO PRE PLAN FOR OUR INCREASED OUTREACH AND RECRUITMENT. SORRY IT'S ALLERGY SEASON FOR ME RECRUITMENT TO EFFECTIVELY RAMP UP HIRING. BLESSED ARE. COME BACK TO ME SORRY. YOU WANT TO TAKE A SIP OF WATER. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO BRANDON NUNEZ CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. SO I DON'T THINK IDEALLY PRESENTERS FOR THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE WITH GOING TO BE MYSELF AND FENCES AND FANELLI. I'M BACK YOU CAN PLEASE CONTINUE IF YOU CAN. SURE SO WE HAVE CONVENE THE DEPARTMENT WORKGROUP TO PRE PLANNED FOR. ANGRIEST OUTREACH AND RECRUITMENT AND I'M RAMPS AND WE'VE BEEN RAMPING THAT UP CREATED DEDICATED TEAMS. REPRESENTING BOTH HUMAN RESOURCES AND PROGRAM AREAS TO STRATEGIZE SOURCES OF NEED A QUALIFIED CANDIDATES. AND TO DIVERSIFY OUT OF REACH. THESE TEAMS HAVE ASSISTED IN RECENT HIRING OF OVER TWO HUNDRED- STAFF FOR COVERT RESPONSE AND WE THINK THAT. MANY OF THOSE FOLKS COULD TRANSITION INTO NEW PERMANENT POSITIONS. I WE ARE DANCING EFFORTS TO UP SKILL OUR WORKFORCE BECAUSE WE DO BELIEVE THAT IF WE HIGHER BUT WE WHOSE STAFF. BUT WE WILL NOT BE IN THE RIGHT WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO ADD. THE EFFORTS TO UP SKILL THE WORKFORCE TO PROVIDE FOR DANCE MEANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXISTING EMPLOYEES. WHILE WE'RE INCREASING RETENTION OF BUILDING OUR LEADERSHIP PIPELINE TURKEY DEPARTMENT POSITIONS. UPSKILLING YOUR WORKFORCE INCLUDES ENHANCE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND CAREER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. SO SORRY SITTING HERE TO BE WORKING WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES TO UPDATE OUR CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM. AND PAY SCALES AS NEEDED TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO RECRUITMENT OF QUALIFIED APPLICANTS AND INCREASE RETENTION OF EXISTING EMPLOYEES. THIS WILL LOOK AT DIVERSITY IN OUR WORKFORCE I AM THE NEW TYPES OF COMPLICATIONS THAT. REVISIT THE MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS WORK THINGS LIKE EDUCATION ALLOW FOLKS WHO HAVE LIVED EXPERIENCED YOU APPLY FOR SOME OF OUR PUBLIC HEALTH POSITIONS EXPANDING SOME OUR- EFFORTS LIKE OUR PATHWAYS PROGRAM WHICH IN WHICH WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO. BRING ON FORTY FIVE PEOPLE FROM ACROSS THE STATE AND PLACED THEM ON OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND THEY'RE PERFORMING A VARIETY OF PUBLIC HEALTH FUNCTIONS. THE SECOND QUESTION WE HAVE IS HOW WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S INVESTMENT STATE PUBLIC HEALTH STAFF ALLOWED TO SUPPORT OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT SPRING BUT NEVER FOUNDATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH AND FOR STRUCTURE THESE INVESTMENTS WILL SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND OUR SUPPORT FOR LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS. THE FULL SPECTRUM UP C. PAGES EFFORT EXPERTISE WILL BE MOBILIZED TO SUPPORT L. A. J. IS RESPONDING TO AND RECOVERING FROM THE CULVERT PANDEMIC AND TO ME CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE AND CHANGING PUBLIC HEALTH NEEDS. WE PLAN TO BUILD OUR REGIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICE THAT WILL PROVIDE EXPERTISE JUST SMALLER LOW RESOURCE OUT DEPARTMENTS PARTICULARLY IN THE AREAS OF COMMUNICATIONS AND IBM DATA ANALYTICS. PROVIDING A FORMAT- FORM FOR STANDARDIZATION OF POLICY ACROSS EACH PUBLIC HEALTH REGION AND FOR GATHERING INPUTS ON THE STATE POLICIES. INCLUDING PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY AGENDA FOR THE STATE HELLO IN COLLABORATION WITH OUR NEW YORK OFFICE OF POLICY AND PLANNING. WE ADMINISTER IT WILL BE ADMINISTERING THE STATE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS DEVELOPING METRICS GOALS AND OTHER STANDARDS FOR INVESTING IN THESE BONDS. WE WILL CONDUCT ANALYSIS OF OTHER REGIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH NEEDS SUCH AS REGIONALIZATION OF TRAINING LABORATORY CAPACITY AND OTHER ISSUES. OUR STATE LEVEL PUBLIC HEALTH LEADERSHIP AND CAPACITY WILL ALSO PROVIDE RESOURCES TOOLS AND SUPPORT FOR ALLEGE DAYS IN CRITICAL AREAS WHERE STATEWIDE ALIGNMENT AND PROGRAMMATIC SUPPORT CAN BOLSTER AND ADVANCE LOCAL EFFORTS. IT'S AGAIN WILL INCLUDE THINGS LIKE THE STATEWIDE COMMUNICATIONS DATA STANDARDS OPERATIONS COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS EVALUATION METHODOLOGIES PLANNING REGENCY RESPONSE IN EQUITY. STATE PUBLIC HEALTH STAFF WILL ORGANIZE AND IMPLEMENT THESE CRITICAL ACTIVITIES IN SUPPORT OF AND IN COLLABORATION WITH L. H. DAYS TO PROMOTE IMPROVED PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE AND OUTCOMES STATEWIDE HEALTH WORK FIRST WILL ALSO RESTORE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN MODIFIED OR TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED AND PROVIDE MORE COMPLETE PROGRAMMATIC SUPPORT. IN ADDRESSING THE CONSEQUENCES OF POPULATION HEALTH BURDEN. WORKFORCE EXPANSION WILL ALSO ENGAGE A NEW SET OF STRATEGIC SKILLS AND TECHNICAL COMPETENCIES REQUIRED TO BE CUTTING EDGE IN PUBLIC OUT SUCH AS WORKING MORE CLOSELY ON SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS CLIMATE CHANGE NERD MEET MORE EFFECTIVELY. TO MORE EFFECTIVELY SERVE IN SUPPORT- ALLEGE THEY WORK IN THESE NEW DOMAINS. OUR OFFICE OF POLICY AND PLANNING WILL BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR ESTABLISHING CLEAR QUANTIFIABLE PERFORMANCE TARGETS TO ROUTE ROGRESS ON THESE INITIATIVES AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL AND BUILD CAPACITY FOR STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP TO ANTICIPATE AND ADDRESS NEW AND EMERGING PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES. SUCH AS ON BEHALF. YEARS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE LAST QUESTION WAS HOW DO WE PROPOSED TO ENSURE THAT COUNTIES DON'T SHIP EXISTING REALIGNMENT FUNDING AWAY FROM PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS FELT. I'M WILL LEVERAGE THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE TWO HUNDRED FOR. TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR MILLION AND LOCAL SYSTEMS TO JUMPSTART ADVANCEMENT OF THE IN THE OF THE VISION THAT WE'VE OUTLINED WE'VE ENGAGE WITH SHE ACTUALLY C. O. H. I. O. N. S. YEAH YOU TO DROP THE METHODOLOGY. TO ALLOCATE THE FUNDING TO ALL ALLEGE DAYS WITH THE INTENT OF DISRUPTING THAT DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN OF PREVENTABLE DISEASES IN POPULATIONS HISTORICALLY IMPACTED. ENCOURAGING COLLABORATION ACROSS COUNTIES AND MAKING SURE FUNDS ARE USED TO SUPPLEMENT RATHER THAN SUPPLANT. ADDITIONALLY THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE IS INCLUDED FOR FUNDING TO SPECIFICALLY PROHIBITS A PLANTATION- AS THE PLANNING OF EXISTING PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE SETS. LANGUAGE INCLUDES LOCAL REAP REALIGNMENT DOLLARS AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE DOLLARS THAT COULD NOT BE SUPPLANTED. THE LANGUAGE ALSO REQUIRES LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS TO ANNUALLY CERTIFY THAT IS NOT USING THE FUNDING PROVIDED JUST A PLAN ALL OTHER LOCAL COUNTY FUNDS. WE'RE REALLY WORKING WITH THE ACT AND CCLI JELENT S. YEAH YOU'D YOU SET THOSE METRICS AND BAN THOSE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS FUNDING SO THAT WE CAN TRACK AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE EVALUATING WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT IMPROVEMENTS ARE BEING MADE WITH THESE DOLLARS AND SO. THAT REGIONAL HEALTH OFFICE WILL HAVE A STAFF NOT ONLY OF THE EXPERTISE IN COMMUNICATIONS AND HAPPY AND- LOCAL COORDINATOR- AND DATA ANALYTICS BUT WE ALSO HAVE A SECTION THAT WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ADMINISTERING THESE BOMBS. AND MAKING SURE THAT THE ACTIVITIES ARE. HAPPENING THERE ARE NONE AS PROPOSED. IN THEIR WORK PLANS AND BUDGETS. WITHOUT I WILL AND THEN HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU AND JUST TO CONFIRM THERE ARE NO OTHER DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH- PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL IS THAT CORRECT. THAT'S THAT'S CORRECT NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM SONYA PADDOCK WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THANK YOU SIR AND YOU PICK THE L. A. O. WE THINK THE PROPOSED PLAN HAS NUMEROUS MERITS- FOR EXAMPLE INCREASING REAL TIME SURVEILLANCE DISEASE SURVEILLANCE COORDINATING REGIONAL EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND COMMUNICATIONS ACTIVITIES AND IMPROVING STRATEGIC PLANNING. WE'D LIKE TO IDENTIFY A FEW ISSUES WHICH IF ADDRESSED WE BELIEVE COULD POTENTIALLY STRENGTHEN THE PLAN. SO FIRST WOULD NOT THAT THE PLAN DOES NOT INCLUDE THREE KEY OBJECTIVES. FIRST CREATING A WORKFORCE PIPELINE ALTHOUGH THE PLAN DOES INCLUDE A MULTI FACETED APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT TRAINING- RECRUITMENT TRAINING AS WELL AS INTERNAL EDUCATION AND ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES IT DOESN'T- INCLUDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR- DEVELOPING A PIPELINE FOR FUTURE WORK FORCE- WE UNDERSTAND THE DEPARTMENT FOR EXAMPLE DID NOT- CONSULT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND INFORMATION ON- SOME OF THEIR WORK FIRST PIPELINE. A PROGRAMS- SECOND THE PLAN DOES NOT INCLUDE STRENGTHENING THE STATE WIDE PUBLIC HEALTH LAB NETWORK- IT DOES INCLUDE FUNDING FOR THE STATE LAB IN FOR LAB FIELD SERVICES. GARCIA COMMERCIAL LAB YOU KNOW LICENSING OF COMMERCIAL LABS BUT THERE ARE NO REQUIREMENTS ARE PLANS FOR ENSURING THAT THE TWENTY EIGHT. REMAINING LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH LABS ARE STAFFED AND SUSTAINED- THIRD THE PLAN DOES INCLUDE LAYING OUT AN OVER ARCHING I. T. STRATEGY. CDPH NOTED TO OUR OFFICE THAT IT DOESN'T TEND TO HIRE A CHIEF IT STRATEGIST. AND DEVELOP A STRATEGY. BUT WHEN THIS PLAN WOULD BE AVAILABLE AND HOW THAT FUTURE VISION I. T. VISION WILL BE FUNDED REMAINS UNCLEAR. OUR NEXT WE THINK THAT THE PLAN COULD HAVE STRONGER OVERSIGHT OF LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS AS WRITTEN THE PLAN DOES NOT LAY OUT. A MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OR GOALS FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. REGARDING TYING THE LOCAL PLANS TO THE COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENTS OUR COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLANS WOULD NOT A COUPLE OF THINGS FIRST- NOT ALL LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENTS OUR COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLANS- WE ALSO KNOW THAT THESE PLANS AND ASSESSMENTS- CAN SOMETIMES INCLUDE GOALS THAT GO BEYOND THE PURVIEW OF PUBLIC HEALTH- JUST TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE IT COULD INCLUDE STRENGTHENING HEALTH CARE. WORKFORCE OR INCREASING STABLE HOUSING OPTIONS- TYING LOCAL PLANS DIRECTLY TO THESE MAY NOT BE THE BEST SUBSTITUTE FOR A MORE DELIBERATE AND CONSISTENT TYPE OF A LOCAL PLAN ACROSS THE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS- A MORE CONSISTENT TYPE OF PLAN WOULD ALSO MAKE STATEWIDE EVALUATION TO BE EASIER- SO WE WOULD JUST REYES AND CLOSING A FEW ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION- FIRST WE'D SUGGEST CONSIDERING. REQUESTING MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE OBJECTIVES THAT WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE PLAN SO WORK FIRST PIPELINE PUBLIC HEALTH LAB NETWORK AN OVER ARCHING I. T. STRATEGY- SECONDS SO WE WOULD- SUGGEST CONSIDERING REQUIRING MORE CDPH MANAGEMENT OF THE LOCAL PLAN DEVELOPMENT AND OVERSIGHT OF LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS USE OF FUNDS. IN THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER CONSIDER IDENTIFYING- COMMON PUBLIC HEALTH OBJECTIVES OR GOALS THAT WOULD PRIORITIZE UNIVERSALLY ACROSS THE STATE. BUT. AND THEN. YEAH YEAH. YEAH. OKAY A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A POSITIVE SIGN TO CASTING. SO HAVE. GET THAT CODE SET UP SO. BEFORE I PUT THE GUY ON THE LINE I SHOULD CONNECTS WITH SORT OF AN ACCOUNT THE PASSWORD AND THEN. SURE THE CLUB THEN THE CONNECTION SURE. HOUSES ARE MORE THESE MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE PASSWORD SOMETHING. RIGHT. FIVE IN YOUR. ZERO THIS IS. YOU HAVE A JOB. YEAH AB ON. THIS IT'S. ONE SIX PEOPLE.

I'M TRYING TO FOLLOW UP- GIVEN OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAE HEARD ABOUT BOTH IN THIS HEARING TODAY AS WELL AS IN THE JOINT HEARING THAT WE HAD LAST WEEK DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE FIFTY EIGHT MILLION IS SUFFICIENT FOR US TO ADDRESS OUR WORKFORCE CHALLENGES AND SECONDS CAN YOU SPEAK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU'VE CONSIDERED. UTILIZING EACH COP HEALTH PROFESSION CAREER OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM WHICH ALSO GOES THROUGH EACH GUY AS A PIPELINE PROGRAM TO HELP- STUDENTS INTO PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE HOPING YOU CAN COMMENT ON THAT. I'M SUSAN COME AHEAD. SURE I'M SO AT IN TERMS OF WORKING THAT ON A KILEY WE WORK WITH THEM IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE RECRUITMENT HARD TO REACH- RECRUITMENT CLASSIFICATIONS I HAVEN'T WE KNOW THAT THE MICROBIOLOGIST SERIES ARE HEALTH OF FACILITIES EVALUATOR NURSE SAYS SOME OF THE AREAS WHERE WE KNOW WE HAVE DIFFICULTY IN RECRUITING I THINK WE HAVE A NUMBER OF STRATEGIES TO TRY TO BUILD THAT PIPELINE AND WE WILL WORK WITH H. K. BUT WILL ALSO. DO THINGS LIKE WE'RE GOING TO DO A CAMPAIGN TO WORK ACROSS THE STATE WITH WORKING OUT I'M WHY COME TO PUBLIC HEALTH WHY IS THAT A GOOD PLACE TO WORK WE NOW WE HAVE TO GET DOWN AS WE BUILD THE LONG TERM WE NEED TO GET DOWN TO THE FOLKS IN HIGH SCHOOLS AND BRING THEY MAKE EVERYBODY KNOWS WITH THAT DOCTOR ARE FIREMEN ARE BUT NOT EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT A PUBLIC HEALTH SEGMENT AS THE AND SO WE NEED TO. DO BETTER ACROSS THE STATE WILL CERTAINLY BE LOOKING UP PIPELINES PERSON NEEDS WITH COMMUNITY I'M TRAINING COLLEGES AS WELL I'M AND CONTINUING TO BUILD THAT I DON'T I CAN'T COMMENT ON THE FIFTY EIGHT MILLION I'M YOU KNOW I THINK THAT WE ALL NOW IT'S GOING TO COST DOLLARS DO YOU REALLY AND MAKE SURE THAT RECRUITMENT EFFORTS ACROSS THE STATE NOT ONLY WITH THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT BUT WE SEE REALLY BIG CHALLENGES AND SOME OF OUR SMALL RURAL AREAS AND IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND RECRUITING POSITIONS AND SO WE WILL BE WORKING WITH THEM. ON. IN PARKWAYS PROGRAM WHICH THINK IF YOU EVER GET A CHANCE TO MEET ANY OF THOSE YOU. FOLKS WHO ARE IN THE PATHWAY PRO. THERE INCREDIBLE COME WITH A- OF BACK. AND REALLY CAN. IN PUBLIC HEALTH IN WAYS THAT IN I THINK WE WILL SEE FOR YEARS TO COME IF WE CAN CONTINUE THAT TYPE OF A PROGRAM. TO RECRUIT PEOPLE THAT I'M HAVE VERY DIFFERENT LIVED EXPERIENCES AND REFLECT OUR POPULATION- DO YOU WANT TO APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND REALLY- I HEAR YOU ON NOT WANTING TO- MAKE A COMMENT ON THE WORK FORCE NUMBER. BUT HOPE THAT YOU HEAR FROM THE LEGISLATURE A WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE AND WORK IN THE SPACE AND ADDRESS THE NEED HEAD ON WE SEE WE HEAR THOSE WHO ARE COMMITTED TO PUBLIC SERVICE AND PUBLIC HEALTH. AND ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE SURE WERE APPROPRIATELY SUPPORTING THEM. THAT I'D NOW LIKE TO REALLY DAY AND IF I CAN TO THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT NON SUPPLEMENTATION LANGUAGE I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR US AS WE ARE- YOU SAID IT WOULD BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE I WOULD AGREE WITH THE L. A. ABOUT THE NEED FOR US TO PUT THIS TO TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. SO THAT WE CAN ANNUAL. WHY CAN YOU SPEAK. WITH THE CLARITY THAT YOU- HAVE ABOUT HOW WE- ARE GOING TO WRITE IN NON SUPPLEMENTATION LANGUAGE INTO THE FUNDS WE ARE. GOING TO BE SENDING DOWN TO THE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS. WE DO ACTUALLY HAVE THAT LANGUAGE AND WE'VE USED IT IN A NUMBER OF FEDERAL GRANTS AS WELL THE FUNDS APPROPRIATED IN THIS ITEM SHALL BE USED TO SUPPLEMENT RATHER THAN SUPPLANT EXISTING LEVELS OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY QUALIFYING LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTION. EACH YEAR LOCAL JURISDICTION RECEIVING FUNDS FOR THIS ARTICLE SHALL ANNUALLY CERTIFY TO THE TO THE DEPARTMENT THAT'S PORTION OF THE FUNDING SHOULD BE USED TO SUPPLANT NOT- TO SUPPLEMENT AND NOT SUPPLANT ALL OTHER SPECIFIC LOCAL COUNTY FUNDS INCLUDING. BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOCAL REALIGNMENT AND COUNTY GENERAL FUND RESOURCES UTILIZED HEALTH CARE SECTION PURPOSES AND EXCLUDING FEDERAL FUNDS IN THIS DETERMINATION IN ADDITION EACH LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS ALL CERTIFY THAT 70% OF FUNDS WERE USED TO SUPPORT STAFF INCLUDING BENEFITS AND TRAINING AND THAT REMAINING FUNDS NOT TO EXCEED THIRTY PERCENT. MAY BE USED FOR A QUICK MINUTE SUPPLIES AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE PURPOSES SUCH AS FACILITY SPACE FURNISHINGS TRAVEL AND SIMILAR ACTIVITIES AND EVERYTHING. LANGUAGE THANK YOU UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY AFTER- SAYING THEY ARE NOT- SUPPLEMENTING EXISTING PLANS. MAYBE IT. WHAT'S THE- THEN SO I UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE ON THE FRONT AND- HOW AND- HAVE WE EVER ENFORCED THIS IS THIS A COMMON PRACTICE FOR US TO- FOLLOW UP ON THAT LANGUAGE. HOW CAN WE ENSURE THAT COUNTIES ARE. FOLLOWING THE LETTER OF THE LAW THAT YOU'RE READY. SO IT IS A REQUIREMENT IN MOST OF OUR FEDERAL FUNDING- THEY DO GET AUDITED. I'M ON A ROUTINE BASIS- AND SO I THINK THAT YOU HAVE THAT THERE ARE METHODS TO REALLY LOOK AT THAT I ALSO THINK THAT IT WILL BE AN EVERYONE'S BEST INTEREST TO POINT OUT ANY- SUPPLEMENTATION AND PART OF WORRIES AND YOU. HAVE THIS LANGUAGE IN HERE IS SO THAT OUR LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS CAN CALL OUR ATTENTION IF NEED BE- THOSE ISSUES BECAUSE THEY WANT TO PROTECT THESE DOLLARS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AS WELL. I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ASK THE SAME QUESTION OF MICHELLE GIVENS IF I CAN WITH JACK. YOU CAN PROVIDE SOME COMMENTARY YEAH HAPPY TO I THINK THE FIRST THING I WOULD MENTION IS THE LANGUAGE THAT THEY'RE READING OFF OF THIS LANGUAGE THAT WE ALSO CRAFTED FOR THEM AS WELL. SO I THINK THE FIRST AND FOREMOST THING IS THAT OUR MEMBERS ARE NOT LOOKING TO SUPPLANT. WE REALLY ARE LOOKING TO BOLSTER WORKFORCE I THINK THERE'S BEEN A WIDESPREAD RECOGNITION THAT LIKE THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO GO BACKWARDS. AND I THINK AND THE CHALLENGE THAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE PAST IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY IN THE FUNDING THAT COMES DOWN RIGHT SO. WE'RE EXCITED AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT THAT LANGUAGE BEING IN THERE ALSO TELLS THEIR BOSSES THAT YOU CAN'T MOVE THAT AND THAT'S A GREAT ASSURANCE FOR US TO HAVE. THE OTHER PIECE THAT I WOULD MENTION TO YOU IS THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE METRICS AND WE WELCOME THOSE METRICS BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO SHOW YOU. THE VALUE THAT THESE DOLLARS ARE BRINGING BECAUSE WE WANT TO COME BACK TO THE TABLE AND SAY LOOK WHAT WHAT WE CAN DO. AND HOW MUCH MORE WE CAN. AND SO WHAT WE HAVEN'T FLESHED OUT EXACTLY WHAT THOSE METRICS ARE GOING TO BE I CAN'T IMAGINE IT BEING SOMEWHERE AROUND LIKE WHAT. WHAT STAFF DID YOU HIRE WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WHAT PROGRAMS THAT BE FOCUSED ON AND I THINK WITH THOSE METRICS YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE GROWTH VERSUS SHRINKAGE. WHO WAS HOPING TO FOLLOW UP ON YOUR COMMENT REGARDING THE ELIMINATION OF. COST BARRIERS. CAN YOU HELP US TO QUANTIFY AND- DIRECT WHERE THOSE. ARE AND WHETHER OR NOT. THEY ARE HINDERING OUR ABILITY TO. RECRUIT AND- RETAIN QUALIFIED PUBLIC HEALTH INDIVIDUALS. YEAH THERE'S- THERE'S SEVERAL SO THE FOR THE FIRST AND MOST OBVIOUS ONE IS AROUND PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES. SO IN ORDER TO GET YOUR PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE CERTIFICATION YOU'RE ALREADY A REGISTERED NURSE AND THEN YOU GO ABOVE AND BEYOND AND GET AN ADDITIONAL CERTIFICATION. THAT CERTIFICATION COSTS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS. AND THEN YOU HAVE TO RECERTIFY EVERY TWO YEARS. AND I BELIEVE THAT'S ANOTHER ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY. AND WHILE THAT AMOUNT ON ITS OWN MIGHT NOT SEEM LIKE A LOT. OF PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES ARE NOT GETTING PAID AS MUCH AS THEIR- THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN THE HOSPITAL SYSTEMS. AND SO THEY'RE THEY'RE ASKING. THEY'RE BASICALLY PUTTING OUT MORE MONEY- TO WORK. AT IN THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND THAT'S A CHALLENGE FOR THEM. BEFORE BEFORE THESE- CERTIFICATION FEES WERE. AT HIGHER. YOU WOULD HAVE MORE INDIVIDUALS WHO ACTUALLY WOULD JUST GET THEIR PUBLIC HEALTH OUR CERTIFICATION. JUST IN CASE THEY WERE INTERESTED IN MAKING A CAREER CHANGE OR JUST SO THAT THEY HAVE THAT BACK. THE BACKGROUND AROUND PUBLIC HEALTH. WE DON'T SEE THAT AS MUCH ANYMORE AND SO THAT'S A HUGE ISSUE. I THINK THE OTHER THING IS ON A FEW OF THE TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT I MENTIONED THAT MICROBIOLOGISTS. EPIDEMIOLOGISTS AND- EXCUSE ME LET ME JUST WENT DOWN A QUICK PUBLIC LAB. THESE PROGRAMS ARE IN EXISTENCE TODAY THEY'RE ON A SMALL SCALE AND THE REASON WHY THEY HAVEN'T BEEN RAMPED UP IS THAT LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE TO PUT UP. EITHER FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO. OFFER TRAINING SLAUGHTER FELLOWSHIP FLAG OR THE DEPARTMENT HAS HAD A LITTLE LIMITED BUDGET. AND SO SOME OF THESE COST BARRIERS THINKING ABOUT A HEALTH DEPARTMENT WHO ARE YOU DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH FUNDING. TO BE ABLE TO PUT DOLLARS TOGETHER. YOU SEE A LOT OF THAT THE TRAINEES ARE THE LANDING AND IN LARGER JURISDICTIONS AT TIMES BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE RESOURCES. AND SO IT'S NOT EQUITABLE AND SO THAT'S WHY WE WANTED TO HAVE STATE INVESTMENTS. WERE YOU COULD TRAIN AND GROW THE COHORTS AT THE DEPARTMENT. AND TRAIN AND EXPAND THE AVAILABILITY TO ALL JURISDICTION. CAN WE HAVE THE DEPARTMENT COMMENT ON WHAT- MICHELLE GIBBONS HAD JUST COMMENTED ON. YEAH I THINK WE'RE IN AGREEMENT WITH MICHELLE WE ARE LOOKING AT THOSE TRAINING PROGRAMS I'M TRYING TO- EXPAND THEM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND WE WILL BE WORKING WITH THEM WE DID DO A REVIEW OF THE- COMMITTEE HEALTH ASSESSMENTS COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLANS AND STRATEGIC PLANS AS WE TRY TO SET UP METRICS WILL BE WORKING WITH G. AXES L. H. O. AND M. C. I. U. I'M IN THE- IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS TO REALLY LOOK AT THE STATE WIDE METRICS BECAUSE WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE. WE'RE EVALUATING WHAT WE'RE GETTING FROM THESE DOLLARS AND IN THE BEGINNING IT WILL BE FOCUSED ON SOMEONE ON SOME OF THE INITIAL HIRING AND TRAINING AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AS WE THEN MOVED TO PUBLIC HEALTH OUTCOMES- YOU KNOW MAYBE AND- STDS OR OTHER AREAS OF FOCUS BUT WILL BE WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SOME STATEWIDE. BUT SOME LOCAL FLEXIBILITY AND WHAT THEY DETERMINE. IS MOST NEED IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. AT TO KNOW FOLLOW UP THE L. A. O.'S- WE SPOKE BRIEFLY ABOUT WORKFORCE PIPELINE I'D LIKE TO NOW ADDRESS SPECIFICALLY. THE NEED FOR US TO STRENGTHEN THE PUBLIC HEALTH LAB NETWORK AS WELL AS AN OVERARCHING IT STRATEGY. HOPING YOU CAN COMMENT ON- BOTH THE NEED AND PLAN. FOR BOTH OF THOSE AREAS. SO I'LL START WITH THIS- STATEWIDE LIVE NETWORK AS YOU KNOW THAT. CALIFORNIA PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY SERVICES OUR PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE AND LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS SINCE THE FIRST. STATE PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY WAS ESTABLISHED WAY BACK IN NINETEEN OH FIVE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS BEEN PROVIDING AND COORDINATING LAB SERVICES FOR CALIFORNIA. I'M GENERALLY OUR LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH LABS PROVIDE SCREENING CASTING FOR COMMON DISEASES AND THE C. PAGE LABORATORIES PROVIDE CONFIRMATORY A REFERENCE TESTING GUIDANCE AND TRAINING IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN INCREASED COSTS AND STAGNANT PUBLIC HEALTH FUNDING. HAVE REALLY IMPACT THAT FOUNDATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES INCLUDING OUR LABS PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC WE AT APERTURE UNDER WAY TO MEET WITH PUBLIC HEALTH LAB LEADERS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND STAFFING NEEDS AND TO ASSESS THE NEED FOR. REVITALIZING ENHANCING THE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH LAB NETWORK. I'M WE HAVE. WE WILL BE. THE PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY WORKING GROUP TO OVERSEE THAT CONTINUED FORMATION OF THE- OUR LABORATORY NETWORKS THIS GROUP LIVE MEMBERS FROM CDPH CALIFORNIA PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY DIRECTORS. CCI JOE GEAC AND OTHERS THAT CHARGE TO THE GROUP WORKGROUP WILL BE TO DEVELOP A CLEAR STRATEGY FOR INTEGRATING OUR TWENTY EIGHT. PUBLIC HEALTH LABS- IDENTIFYING STEPS THAT THE STATE LAB AND PUBLIC HEALTH LABS CAN TAKE TO IMPROVE AND COORDINATE COMMUNICATION STATEWIDE. WILL BE ESTABLISHING STANDARDS FOR TESTING AND SERVICES THAT BY THE STATE IDENTIFIES SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH LABS TO PRIORITIZE IT- UNIVERSALLY AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH. REQUIRING PUBLIC HAVE HEALTH LABS TO MEET SPECIFIC GOALS ARE SPEND. AMOUNTS OF AT SOME PREDETERMINED AMOUNTS OF FUNDING FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES I AM AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK AS A GROUP AND TRY TO COME UP WITH. THE NEW WAYS TO MAKE OUR PUBLIC LAB SYSTEM WORK FOR EVERYONE WE KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN STAFFING CHALLENGES AND THAT WE- HAVE SEEN SOME LABS YOU KNOW BREATHING. I'M NOT BE ABLE TO GET A LAB DIRECTOR AND THEREFORE HAVE TO CLOSE AND SO WE REALLY DO WANT TO- WORK WITH THAT. I'M AND WE WILL BE CENTRALIZING OUR OWN STATE LABORATORIES- COME JULY JULY OF THIS YEAR AND INTO SEPTEMBER AND WE THINK THAT WE WILL. ESTABLISH A GROUP THAT CAN REALLY WORK ON TIS WITH OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AS WE COME UP WITH A PLAN FOR THE FUTURE I'M WE ARE. IN THE PROCESS RIGHT NOW OF SCHEDULING KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS SO THAT WE CAN BRING THIS WORKER BACK TOGETHER- HOPEFULLY IN SOMETIME IN JUNE- WITH A DRAFT OF SOME OF THE IDEAS THAT PEOPLE HAVE IN TERMS OF THE- THE PUBLIC HEALTH LEADERS ACROSS THE STATE. SO WE KNOW THAT THERE'S WORK TO BE DONE OUR STATE LABS WE'VE BEEN A LITTLE BIT DELAYED BY THE PANDEMIC BUT WE'RE ANXIOUS TO GET BACK TO WORK AND WORK WITH OUR NEW. CENTRALIZED CENTER- THAT WILL BE HELPING TO RE ENVISION- AND. STRENGTHEN OUR LABORATORY NETWORK. UP UNTIL TO PULL MICHELLE WITH. THANK YOU I WOULD ECHO EVERYTHING THAT THE FINALE IS SAYING THE ONE PIECE THAT I WOULD JUST ADD THOUGH IS THAT. AT BECAUSE OF FUNDING- INADEQUATE FUNDING AND AS IN THE FINALE STATED THAT THE CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE HAVING WITH FINING LAB DIRECTORS. SEVERAL LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE CLOSED OVER THE PAST DECADE AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW YET IS WHAT IS THE PROPER NUMBER. OF LABS TO HAVE IN OUR STATE PUBLIC HEALTH LABS WHO ARE UNIQUE FROM OTHER LABORATORIES IN OUR IN OUR STATE. AND SO ONE THING THAT WE WOULD JUST AFTER THAT IN THESE WORKING GROUPS AND THESE DISCUSSIONS THAT THERE REALLY BE A STUDY A STRONG STUDY OF. WHAT SHOULD OUR CAPACITY BE IT IS IT PER POPULATION IS AT HER LIKE SIZE AND REGION. I KNOW CAREER SERVICES AND THINGS LIKE THAT HAVE TO BE INVOLVED AS WELL SO WE WOULD JUST ASK FOR A DETAILED STUDY INTO. IS THE ADMIN. AMENABLE TO A NEEDS ASSESSMENT TO ANALYZE THE LAB NETWORK FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YES WE DID YEARS OUR NATIONAL- BUT HELP LABS THE SYSTEM TO A AND IF YOU LOOK AT OUR CENTRALIZED LAB OUR STATE LAB AND THEY DID DO AN ASSESSMENT MADE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR US AND I THINK WE NEED A SIMILAR PROCESS. HOW FINAL QUESTIONS GOING O BE REGARDING THE PUBLIC HEALTH COR I THINK IT'S ON PAGE TWENTY EIGHT OF THE AGENDA YOU STATE THAT YOU WILL BE ESTABLISHING APPROXIMATELY A THOUSAND PUBLIC HEALTH VLUNTEERS WHO ARE TRAINED CENTRALLY WHERE IS THAT CENTRAL LOCATION WHERE YOU WILL BE TRAINING THEM HAVE WE ESTABLISHED THAT TRAINING PROGRAM CAN YOU ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THIS PUBLIC HEALTH COR. THERE WERE SO IT'S VERY MUCH LIKE OUR COCONUT PROGRAM IN FACT THE PEOPLE MANAGING IT ARE THE SAME PEOPLE WHO MANAGED OUR CAL CONNECT. OUT WHERE WE TRAINED OVER TEN THOUSAND CAL- CONTACT TRACERS AND SO THEY WILL BE CREATING THAT SYSTEM OF- VOLUNTEERS AND SOME OF THOSE. THOSE VOLUNTEERS FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE WILL BE I'M- SOMEWHAT I'M STATE PEOPLE WHO WILL VOLUNTEER TO SERVE IN THAT CAPACITY WILL BE ON THEIR STATE DEPARTMENTS AND THEIR SUPERVISORS WILL. AND WORK WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE AN IMMEDIATE SIDE OF STATE PEOPLE WHO CAN- JUMP INTO RESPONSIBLE. I AM SO WILL BE PARTNERING WITH OUR ACADEMIC PARTNERS TO DEVELOP THE TRAINING. I WILL HOLD MY QUESTIONS ON OVERARCHING NIGHT T. STRATEGY UNTIL ISSUE SEVEN- TWO ISSUES FROM NOW TO DISCUSS MORE IN DETAIL- WITH THAT I WILL NOW MOVE US ON TO- ISSUE NUMBER SIX IF WE CAN- THANK VERY MUCH THIS PANEL WE WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER SIX AND WE CAN START AT THE TOP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M GONNA MAKE SOME OPENING COMMENTS THE DOCTOR OUT OF ON AGAIN. AND THEN I'M GONNA HAVE A BRANDON NATIVE IT'S GO FOR THE BUDGET. BOB GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN- DOCTOR ARAMBULA MEMBERS. TWO YEARS AGO- TWO YEARS AGO ALMOST TO THIS DAY CALIFORNIA WAS THE FIRST DAY TO ISSUE A STAY AT HOME ORDER IN THE UNITED STATES. CALIFORNIA WAS ABLE TO FLATTEN THE CURVE TO SAVE LIVES WHILE BUYING TIME FOR VACCINE DEVELOPMENT. LEARNING ABOUT THE BIOLOGY OF THE NEW CORONAVIRUS AND ITS TRANSMISSION. AND ALSO THE TIME TO DEVELOP AND DISTRIBUTE EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS SCIENCE AND TODAY CALIFORNIA EIGHTY THREE POINT 6% OF PERSONS FIVE YEARS OR OLDER HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF A VACCINE SEVENTY FOUR POINT 3% OF PERSONS FIVE YEARS OR OLDER ARE FULLY VACCINATED. AND SEVENTY THREE POINT 1% OF PERSON SIXTY FIVE YEARS AND OLDER ARE BOOSTED. AMONG THE SIX MOST POPULOUS STATES CALIFORNIA HAS THE LOWEST CUMULATIVE DEATH RATE BETTER THAN THE STATE'S MANY CALIFORNIA HAVE SUFFERED LOSS IN SOME COMMUNITIES WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED. AS OF TODAY WE HAVE OVER EIGHTY SEVEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS HAVE DIED FROM KOBE. IN TWENTY TWENTY ACCESS THAT'S FOR ALL FROM ALL CAUSES INCREASED BY 15% IN CALIFORNIA'S BEYOND COVERT DEATH REAL LIFE EXPECTANCY DECREASED BY THREE POINT SIX YEARS. I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS WITH ANALYSIS THAT OF TWENTY TWENTY DATA AND WHEN WE COULD THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE DATA WE EXPECT THESE NUMBERS TO BE EVEN HIGHER GIVEN THAT THOUGHT THAT'S WHEN WE HAD A BIG PUT YOUR SEARCH. ALTHOUGH WE ARE RECOVERING FROM THE WINTER WAVE OF THE OVERCROWDING VARIANTS BE A POINT ONE. WE NOW FACE A THREAT FROM THE OMICRON VARIANT BA TO THAT SPREADING INTO OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. OTHER COUNTRIES ARE FACING YOU SEARCHES OF COVERED CASES AND DEATHS. MORE TRANSMISSION AROUND THE WORLD MEANS NEW VARIANTS WILL EMERGE. LIKELY MORE CONTAGIOUS AND POSSIBLY CAUSING MORE SEVERE DISEASE. THE GOVERNOR'S SMARTER PLAN ISABOUT BEING SMARTER TAKING OUR LESSONS LEARNED AND BALANCING BOTH READING THIS RECOVERY. THE COVERED BUDGET WILL CONTRIBUTE WILL CONTRIBUTE TO OUR READINESS TO TACKLE FUTURE KOBE THREATS. I WILL TURN IT OVER TO BRANDON NUNEZ CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS AT CDPH WILL REVIEW THE BUDGET BRANDON. THANK YOU DOCTOR ARE GONE- GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME'S BRANDON UNISON THE CHIEF DEPUTY FOR OPERATIONS HERE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH- AS YOU KNOWN AS YOU MAY REMEMBER BACK IN EARLY FEBRUARY WE HAD A- HEARING ON THE EARLY ACTION PACKAGE. THAT WAS PASSED LAST MONTH- WHICH INCLUDED ONE POINT SIX BILLION FOR ONGOING COVERT RESPONSE ACTIVITIES- AND THAT EARLY ACTION SUPPORTED RESPONSE ACTIVITIES THROUGH THIS CURRENT FISCAL YEAR SO GEN. SO FOR THE ISSUE AND FOR ANY TODAY- WHAT WE'RE DISCUSSING OF THOSE SME TYPES OF COVERED RESPONSE ACTIVITIES BUT FOR THE BUDGET YEAR SPECIFICALLY THROUGH DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO- AND THAT'S PART OF WHAT IS DRIVING- THAT EXTENSION THROUGH THIS FIRST HALF OF THE BUDGET YEAR COMING UP. IS WHAT'S DRIVING THAT ADDITIONAL SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE MILLION THAT'S BEFORE YOU ON THE AGENDA ON PAGES THIRTY FOUR AND THIRTY FIVE DOES A REALLY GOOD JOB OF LAYING THIS OUT IT'S ALL JUST KIND OF GET SOME OF THE HIGH POINTS- OF EACH OF THESE DIFFERENT COST CATEGORIES. AND THEN WE HAVE SOME OF OUR TEAM HERE FROM THE VARIOUS THE TESTING PASSPORTS VACCINE IT'S BETTER- IF THERE'S ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY. ON OF THESE APPROACH- BUT SPECIFICALLY IN THE AREA OF VACCINATIONS- THERE'S A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO MILLION BEING REQUESTED. AND THIS IS GOING TO SUPPORT OUR VARIOUS VACCINE BOOSTER OUTREACH EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE CAMPAIGNS. IT PROVIDES SOME OF THE ENDS AND ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR VACCINES SITES ARE STRIKE TEAMS. AND THAT SUPPORTS SOME OF OUR VACCINE MOBILE UNITS- THAT GO ACROSS COUNTIES AND LOCAL ALL JURISDICTIONS TO RIDE UP A CLINIC SERVICES- IN THE AREA TESTING THERE'S A REQUEST OF. APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO MILLION. AND THIS IS GONNA GO TO PROVIDE SPECIMEN COLLECTION SERVICES- TO PARIS MODALITIES SUCH AS DRIVE THROUGH MOBILE AT HOME- AS WELL AS SOME SITE EXPANSION FOR EXISTING COLLECTION SITES SUCH AS EXPANDING LANE OURS ARE SORRY- INCREASING LANES. HOURS DAYS OF SERVICES OFFERED- AND THEN OF COURSE PART OF THIS- BUDGET GOES TO PROVIDING DIAGNOSTIC TESTING SERVICES AS WELL- IN THE AREA OF CONTACT TRACING THERE'S EIGHTEEN MILLION BEING REQUESTED- MUCH OF THIS FUNDING IS GOING TO ESTABLISH THE PUBLIC HEALTH RESERVE CORPS THE YOU JUST TOUCHED ON- IN THE AREA- MEDICAL SURGE STAFFING THERE'S A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR POINT THREE MILLION BEING REQUESTED. AND THAT GOES TO SUPPORT REGISTERED NURSES NURSE ASSISTANTS CLINICAL TAX- AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL IN BOTH THE AREAS OF MEDICAL SEARCH NEEDS AND HEALTH CARE FACILITIES. AS WELL AS TO HELP ON TO IT IT MINISTERING VACCINATIONS. AND THEN FINALLY I HIGHLIGHT THAT AS PART OF THIS PROPOSAL THERE'S ARMS. FOR MILLION DOLLAR FOR BORDERS SEVENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR BORDER ACTIVITIES- AND THIS IS OUR BORDER ACTIVITIES IT'S CURRENTLY BEING DONE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH FEDERAL LOCAL AND NONPROFIT PARTNERS- THAT THOSE ACTIVITIES ARE BEING DONE- DOWN ON THE BORDER AND IMPERIAL SAN DIEGO AND RIVERSIDE COUNTIES- INCLUDE SERVICES JUST. TESTING TEMPORARY SHELTER VACCINES- AND CORNISH FOR ONWARD YOUR GENDER IS A REALLY GOOD JOB OF LAYING THESE OUT AND ALL STOP FOR ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE HAVE NO COMMENT FROM SONYA PADDOCK- WITH LA- SO I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DENTIST TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE AND HAVING DISCUSSED THIS DURING OUR INITIAL HEARING WANTED TO THANK VERY MUCH THIS PANEL WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO PANEL FOR. AND ISSUE SEVEN- WHICH IS THE DISEASE SURVEILLANCE READINESS- RESPONSE RECOVERY AND MAINTENANCE OF IT OPERATIONS B. C. P. WE WILL HAVE THREE PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL FROM CDPH AND ELLIE- LET US BEGIN WITH DOCTOR JAMES BOND WHO IS THE ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR. FOR THE CENTER FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES AT CDPH. CAN YOU BEGIN MITCHELL GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR ARAMBULA MEMBERS- I WILL BEGIN WITH SOME BRIEF CONTEXT AND THEN JOHN PURCELL THE CHIEF OF OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT DIVISION WILL DESCRIBE THE PROPOSAL. PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC CDPH HAD INFECTIOUS DISEASE INFORMATION SYSTEMS THAT WERE SUFFICIENT FOR ROUTINE ACTIVITIES. BUT WE'RE LIMITED IN FUNCTIONALITY DUE TO LIMITED RESOURCES AND THE SYSTEMS WERE NOT SUFFICIENT FOR THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE. THE DISEASE REPORTING SYSTEM WAS QUICKLY OVERWHELMED BY THE VOLUME OF DATA BEING REPORTED ON ALL POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE COVERED NINETEEN TESTS. WE WENT FROM AN AVERAGE OF FEWER THAN TEN THOUSAND INCOMING MESSAGES PER DAY TO MORE THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND BY JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY. AND IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO WE WERE RECEIVING UP TO SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND PER DAY. IN RESPONSE WE SET UP A NEW SYSTEM FOR RECEIVING LABORATORY DATA. AND IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF MEASURES TO BE ABLE TO RECEIVE ANALYZE AND REPORT LARGE VOLUMES OF DATA QUICKLY AND CONSISTENTLY. WE DID NOT HAVE FLEXIBLE TOOLS TO SUPPORT CASE INVESTIGATION AND CONTACT TRACING PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC. SO WE SET UP A NEW STATEWIDE SYSTEM TO SUPPORT THESE ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS TO MOVE DATA BETWEEN SYSTEMS. WE COULD NOT SEND AUTOMATED COMMUNICATIONS TO PERSONS INFECTED WITH ARE EXPOSED TO COVER NINETEEN PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC. BUT WE HAVE NOW DEVELOPED THESE TOOLS AND SENDING AUTOMATED MESSAGES HAS BEEN VERY IMPORTANT PARTICULARLY IN TIMES WHEN CASE COUNTS HAVE BEEN VERY HIGH. WE ALSO NEEDED NEW TOOLS TO SUPPORT COULD NINETEEN VACCINATION EFFORTS THAT WERE NOT NEEDED BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED A TOOL FOR PEOPLE TO DETERMINE THEIR VACCINE ELIGIBILITY FIND A VACCINATION SITE AND SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT. NEW TOOL FOR TO SUPPORT ORDERING AND INVENTORY MANAGEMENT BY VACCINE PROVIDERS ALLOCATIONS IN ORDER MANAGEMENT FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. AND THE SYSTEM FOR THE PUBLIC TO OBTAIN VACCINE VERIFICATION. AND FINALLY WE ENHANCE THE IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY TO MANAGE GREATLY INCREASED DATA VOLUME AND COMMUNICATE WITH HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS. IN THE PANDEMIC THE NUMBER OF DOSES REPORTED DAILY TO THE IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY HAS DOUBLED AND THE NUMBER OF QUERIES TO THE SYSTEM FOR VACCINE RECORDS HAS INCREASED FIVE FOLD. CHAU STOP THERE AND HANDED OVER TO JOHN RISA. THANK YOU DOCTOR WHAT. I'M JOHN RUSSELL I AM THE ACTING DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICES DIVISION BUT CALIFORNIA PARTNER PUBLIC HEALTH T. PORTION. CHECK YOUR PH AS LEVERAGE FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDING TO INVEST IN HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND DATA SYSTEMS CREATED AND MODIFIED DURING THE PANDEMIC. WE ADOPTED OUR CURRENT TECHNOLOGY TO WORK WITH NEW MODERN ARCHITECTURES THAT PROVIDE SHE COMPONENTS OF THE HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY TO RESPOND TO THE KOBE NINETEEN. AND THE URGENT NEED FOR ENHANCED DISEASE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS SUCH AS- HOW CONNECT MY FEEDBACKS MY CHURCH. DIGITAL COBIT ACTING RECORD IN VIRTUAL ASSISTANT. IS TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE ARE ALSO ESSENTIAL FOR CD PH AND THE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS TRIFECTA THE TRACK AND GATHER DATA ON KOBE NINETEEN TEN OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES. PERFORMING CONTACT TRACING TO MINIMIZE DISEASE SPREAD OFFICIALLY ADMINISTER LIFE SAVING VACCINES RAPIDLY PERFORMER COBIT NINETEEN TESTS AND DEPLOY PERSONNEL IN ALL AREAS OF PANDEMIC RESPONSE. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICE DIVISION IN THE CENTER FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES IS REQUESTING A HUNDRED THIRTY POSITIONS FORTY FIVE FOR NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE FOR PROGRAM AND HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE POINT TWO MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. A TOTAL OF A HUNDRED FORTY POSITIONS AND HUNDRED FIFTY SIX POINT ONE MILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. AND A TOTAL OF A HUNDRED FORTY POSITIONS IN. AND SIXTY ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION. IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. IN ANNUALLY THEREAFTER FROM THE GENERAL FUND. THIS PROJECT IS A FUNDING REQUESTED ARE NEEDED TO MAINTAIN AND OPERATE THE CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEMS. PORTCHESTER PROGRAMMATIC SERVICES STATEWIDE PREPARE FOR AND RESPOND TO FUTURE EMERGENCIES ON LARGE SCALE DISASTERS AND BUILD CDPH OPERATIONAL AND TECHNOLOGY RESULTS. THANK YOU. NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM SONYA PADDOCK WITH THE L. A. O. THANK YOU SO NAY PARTICULARLY- AS WE NOTED EARLIER WE REALLY THINK- CDPH NEEDS AN OVERARCHING I. T. STRATEGY FOR ALL PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS. AND THE DEPARTMENT DID INDICATE TO OUR OFFICE THAT IT WILL BE DEVELOPING A STRATEGY UNDER HE LEADERSHIP OF A NEW CHIEF IT STRATEGIST. I'M THE DEPARTMENT ALSO NOTED TO OUR OFFICE THAT IT'S IN THE PROCESS OF CONDUCTING A HOLISTIC ASSESSMENT OF THE D. DISEASE SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY ECOSYSTEM SPECIFICALLY- WHICH WHICH IS GOOD- BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE RECOGNIZE THAT THESE EXISTING SYSTEMS- IN THE PROPOSAL ARE CRITICAL FOR BOTH COVERED NINETEEN RESPONSE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE SURVEILLANCE OVERALL WE THINK IT DOES SEEM REASONABLE TO BRING SOME OF THE MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS OF THESE SYSTEMS IN HOUSE SO THAT CDPH HAS GREATER VISIBILITY INTO EACH SYSTEM AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE CHANGES AS NEEDED SO WE ARE NOT RAISING ANY. ISSUES WITH THAT THIS PARTICULAR REQUEST. THANK YOU AYE- AND THAT CONCLUDES THIS PANEL OF BRING IT UP TO THE DIETS FOR ANY MEMBER QUESTIONS I WILL KEEP IT HERE AT THE CHAIR- MY FIRST QUESTION IS FOR CDPH- WE HEARD ABOUT THE NEED FOR THE OVER ARCHING IT STRATEGY AND- THE DIRECTION THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS GOING IS TO HIRE A CHIEF. HI T. STRATEGIST. BUT I'D LIKE TO GET A SENSE OF I CAN- DOES THE DEPARTMENT PLAN WITH THE STRATEGIST- CENTRALIZING COORDINATE MANY OF THE I. T. SYSTEMS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE SO THAT THEY WORK TOGETHER AS A CENTRALIZED SYSTEM. IS THAT THE OVER ARCHING GOAL THAT WILL COME WITH THE HIRING OF THIS CHIEF IT STRATEGIST. SO THIS JOB OR SELL AGAIN- THE GOAL IS THAT THE I. T. STRATEGIST REALLY TO ASSESS OUR OUR CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE IN DETERMINE WHAT ARCHITECTURES. AND TECHNOLOGIES CAN FIT TOGETHER AND BE CONSOLIDATED TO BEST MEET THE NEEDS ARE FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH. INITIATIVES AND FORMULATE A CLEAR DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION STRATEGY ROAD MAP TO GOVERNOR PRIORITIZE IN A LINE CRITICAL PLANNING ACTIVITIES INITIATIVES AND PROJECTS FOR THE FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH INITIATIVES. I'D BRING IT UP BECAUSE THE BEST TIME TO PLAN FOR EMERGENCIES WHEN YOU'RE NOT IN ONE. AND IF WE HAVE A CHANCE TO ACTUALLY IMPROVE OUR I. T. SYSTEMS FOR THE NEXT ONE. I THINK IT'S IMPERATIVE FOR US TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S FULLY FUNCTIONING. AND I AND I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO. I STILL THINK BACK TOWARDS CAL READY AND SOME OF THE DIFFICULTIES MANY OF US HAD INTERNED IN INTERFACING WITH THAT PROGRAM REPORTING INFORMATION- TO THE STATEWIDE SYSTEM THAT- THAT I WOULD LIKE. TO BE ABLE TO HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT WHAT THAT OVERARCHING STRATEGY IS- FIRST OFF THIS NEXT QUESTION I HAVE WILL BE FOR THE L. A. O. AND IT'S TO- SEE IF YOU CAN HELP ME TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER OR NOT THESE OF GONE THROUGH THE POWER PROCESS- AND WHETHER OR NOT. ARE THESE PROJECTS. SHOULD BE GOING THROUGH THE POWER PROCESS OR SHOULDN'T SAY WHAT'S YOUR UNDERSTANDING. OUR UNDERSTANDING AND MR CELL CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG- IS THAT A NUMBER OF THESE ARE SORT OF EXISTING SYSTEMS THAT NEED SOME KIND OF A GRADE OR THEY'RE BRINGING MAYBE SOME EXTERNAL FONG- MANAGEMENT IN HOUSE. AND THEN SOME OF THE OTHER PROJECTS THAT ARE NEW OR ARE GOING THROUGH- THE HELP PROCESS AND I DON'T. HAVE MY NOTES WITH ME ON HAND TO IDENTIFY A WHICH WHICH OF THOSE- ARE GOING THROUGH THE POWER PROCESS BUT- OUR OFFICES- GENERALLY IN AGREEMENT THAT THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A **** A GOOD OVERSIGHT FUNCTION AND- AND GOOD FOR A. T. PROJECTS SO. I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT AS THE LEGISLATURE WORKED HARD TO ESTABLISH THAT PROCESS TO OVERSEE THE IT PROJECTS. TO ENSURE THAT WE HAD ACCOUNTABILITY WITH PUBLIC DOLLARS- THAT THAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO SEND AS MANY OF THESE ID PROJECTS AS- AS ARE NEEDED THROUGH THE APPROPRIATE PROCESS SO WE HAVE THAT OVERSIGHT FUNCTION- BUT WOULD LOVE TO- HAVE YOU COMMENT- IN RESPONSE TO. WHAT MISS PEDICABS JUST SAID. YES WE AGREE WITH MISS PADDICK AND WE CURRENTLY HAVE- LET YOU MENTION ABOUT TO SYSTEMS THAT WE STOOD UP TO MEET THE NEEDS OF COBIT IN RESPONSE. THOSE SYSTEMS CURRENTLY IN HOUSE WE'RE OPTIMIZING AND RATIONALIZING THOSE TO BE MORE EFFICIENT MORE EFFECTIVE AND BE MORE RESPONSIVE THERE ARE ALSO ADDITIONAL- EFFORTS GOING ON TO UPGRADE OR- BUILT NEW SYSTEMS AND THOSE WILL GO THROUGH THE POWER PROCESS AS IDENTIFIED- I THINK ONE OF THE- EXAMPLES OF THAT IS C. C. R. S. THAT IS PROBABLY. ONE OF THE BEST EXAMPLES THAT I CAN GET RIGHT NOW- BUT OTHERS ARE IDENTIFIED WE WILL DEFINITELY GO THROUGH THE POWER PROCESS AND MAKE SURE THAT- WE ARE- REPORTING AND A FULL. ALL THE REGULATIONS EVER CONTROL AGENCIES. WITHOUT A WILL THANK VERY MUCH PANEL FOR WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO A PANEL FIVE WHICH WILL BE PRESENTING ON THREE CLIMATE CHANGE RELATED PROPOSALS UNDER THE OFFICE OF HEALTH EQUITY WE WILL HAVE THREE PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL INCLUDING DR ROSHAN RADHAKRISHNA. DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF HEALTH EQUITY AS WELL AS LINDA HELEN'S CLIMATE CHANGE AND HEALTH EQUITY SECTION CHIEF WITH CD PH AND SONYA PADDOCK WITH THE L. L. WE WILL PAUSE AFTER EACH PROPOSAL IS PRESENTED SO THAT WE MAY ASK QUESTIONS CAN WE PLEASE BEGIN WITH DOCTOR RADHAKRISHNA ON ISSUE EIGHT. THANK YOU CHAIR ARAMBULA MEMBERS JOINING TODAY THAT'S MY HONOR TO BE REPRESENTING THE DEPARTMENT ON ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT WHICH IS ABOUT HOMELESSNESS. AND ASSEMBLY BILL TWELFTH TWENTY REGARDING THE CALIFORNIA INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS. ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE TWENTY IT IS REQUIRED TO HAVE THE PARTICIPATION AND LEADERSHIP FROM OVER TWENTY UNIQUE STATE AGENCIES DEPARTMENTS AND OTHER BODIES OF GOVERNMENT ON THE NEW PAL INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS WHICH INCLUDES FOR THE FIRST TIME CAL HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY DR GALLEY AS THE NEW CO CHAIR. END CDPH DIRECTOR DIRECTOR ADAM GONE AS A NEW MEMBER. THIS PROPOSAL REQUESTS TO POSITIONS AND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM GENERAL FUND AN ONGOING TO PROVIDE CDPH PROGRAM COORDINATION. DATA ANALYTICS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO MAXIMIZE THE POPULATION HEALTH BENEFITS AND THE HEALTHCARE COSTS SAVINGS BY ENDING HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA WITH FOUR MAIN GOALS FOR OUR PROPOSED INVOLVEMENT. FIRST TO SUPPORT MORE COORDINATION OF INTERAGENCY WORKGROUPS AND TO PROVIDE PUBLIC HEALTH AND EQUITY ACOSTA STINTS AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE COUNCIL OVERALL. SECOND TO PROVIDE PUBLIC HEALTH DATA AND ANALYTICAL SUPPORT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL AND STATE GRANTEES WHO ARE PARTICIPANTS IN THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT'S CONTINUUM OF CARE PROGRAM. THIRD TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS TO STATE STRATEGIES TO MAXIMIZE THOSE POPULATION HEALTH BENEFITS AND HEALTH CARE COST SAVINGS. AND FOURTH TO PROVIDE POLICY AND PROGRAMMATIC RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION TO THE DIRECTOR AND SECRETARY FROM THE FIRST MEETING IN JANUARY I THANK YOU DOCTOR ARAMBULA AS AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN IN ME AS A FAMILY PHYSICIAN CAN AGREE I'LL SHARE A QUOTE FROM THAT FIRST COUNCIL MEETING IN JANUARY WHICH IS THAT THERE IS NO MEDICINE. AS POWERFUL AS HOUSING HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM LINDA HOLLAND. YES THE CLARIFIED MISS HELEN WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR MORE DETAILS ON ISSUE NUMBER NINE INTENT BUT NOT FOR ISSUE GREAT GREAT NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM SONYA PADDOCK WITH YELLOW. THANK YOU A DOCTOR IN THE LAB- SUNAPEE KALLIO WE'VE REVIEWED THIS PROPOSAL AND DON'T RAISE ANY CONCERNS. I WILL NOW BRING IT UP TO THE D√çAS TO SEE IF ANY MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS I WILL KEEP IT HERE WITH THE CHAIR- I'M GONNA BEGIN- FIRST- DR RADHAKRISHNAN. I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED WE RUN A PANEL A FEW WEEKS AGO AND YOU HAD. SHARED A QUOTE FROM ONE OF YOUR MENTORS. ABOUT HOW THE ORIGIN OF SO MANY OF OUR PROBLEMS IN LIFE IS SEEING OTHERS AS LESS THAN. YOURSELF AND I BELIEVE SO OFTEN WITH HOMELESSNESS WE DON'T RECOGNIZE THAT THOSE WHO ARE ON THE STREETS ARE MEMBERS OF OUR FAMILIES AND MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITIES HEY. GO TO R. TWELVE THOUSAND GO TO SCHOOLS WITH US THAT I AT THE START OF THIS CONVERSATION WANTED TO HUMANIZE AND NORMALIZE. AND MAKE SURE WE'RE RECOGNIZING THAT THOSE ON THE STREETS ARE ABSOLUTELY ARE EQUALS AND DESERVE OUR FULL ATTENTION. NOW I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO DIG IN A LITTLE BIT AND I'M GONNA PUSH A LITTLE HERE I APOLOGIZE. BUT FOR US TO IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVELY AB TWELVE TWENTY WERE COMBINING TWENTY DIFFERENT UNIQUE STATE AGENCIES AND YET I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE. THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR JUST TWO POSITIONS I WAS HOPING YOU COULD EXPLAIN THE ADMINISTRATION'S THINKING IN THIS REGARD AS IT SEEMS A LITTLE AN ADEQUATE FOR US TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS THAT'S BEFORE US. AND THE MULTITUDE OF ASPIRATIONS FROM WITHIN THIS BILL. THAT ARE ON PAGE FORTY OF THIS AGENDA I WAS JUST HOPING TO HAVE YOU COMMENT ON THAT IF POSSIBLE. THANK YOU CHAIR FOR THAT QUESTION- THIS IS A START THERE ARE EXISTING HOUSING PROGRAMS SERVICES STAFF ACROSS THE SEVENTEEN DEPARTMENTS AND OFFICES WITHIN AGENCY- AND WHILE THE AGENCY HAS HAD REPRESENTATION ON THE COUNCIL BEFORE IT IS NEVER HAD THE SECRETARY BEING CO CHAIR SO THAT. IS NEW AND DESERVE SOME ADDITIONAL BAND WITH. SECONDS WE FOR THE FIRST TIME HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH JOINING THIS NEW COUNCIL IN ITS NEW VERSION TWO POINT OH THAT WAS LAUNCHED IN JANUARY. AND PUBLIC HEALTH HAS MANY ASSETS- DIRECTOR ARE GOING SPEAKS ABOUT THE FOUR PILLARS THE ECO SOCIAL APPROACH. CENTRING EQUITY CENSURING PRIMARY PREVENTION- AND FOCUSING ON ON THE ANTI RACISM. AND I THINK THAT HAVING AT LEAST TWO DEDICATED STAFF TO BEGIN- HELPS US LEVERAGE OUR DATA SKILLS AND OUR PREVENTION AREA OF SPECIALTY. SO WHILE THE OTHER- SECRETARY- LOTUS KATHRADA NEAR AS HAS STOPPED SUPPORTING THE COUNCIL AND CERTAINLY OUR AGENCY DOES AS WELL. WE HAVE ON A NEW ASSISTANT SECRETARY- SUPPORTING COMING YOU CAN AND- AS A DEPUTY SECRETARY AND MANY OTHERS WHEN IN PUBLIC HEALTH THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST TME THAT WE ARE REALLY. MEANING DEDICATED FULL TIME STAFF TO NOT JUST FOCUS ON COATED AND HOMELESSNESS. OR A DIFFERENT SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTION LIKE SYPHILIS SAY AND THE RISKS OF HOMELESSNESS BUT REALLY TO BRING OUR DATA AND POLICY EXPERTISE SO WE'VE OUTLINED IN THE JOB DESCRIPTION VERY SPECIFIC ROLES. FOR THOSE TO STAFF- AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO JOINING THE BROADER STAFFING COMMUNITY WITH AN AGENCY TO SUPPORT I'M MORE EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTION FOCUSED. ORIENTATION. FOR OUR PARTICIPATION ON THIS COUNCIL. I LOOK FOR TO THE RESULTS OF THESE- DATA SKILLS SPECIALIST- IT WILL BUT WILL PUT FORWARD SINCE ASSEMBLY MEMBER REVERSES FROM OUR HOUSE THE M. PORTENTS FOR MANY OF US OF MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE STANDING UP THIS BILL AND THEN APPROPRIATELY RESOURCING AT THAT I WOULD LOVE FOR US TO ENGAGE IN WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS SUFFICIENT FOR US TO ADDRESS. THE DATA NEEDS FOR THIS COUNCIL AS WE GO THROUGH THESE NEXT FEW WEEKS BUT WITH THAT I WILL THANKS VERY MUCH- THIS PANEL WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ISSUE SEVEN. CAN WE PLEASE BEGAN- DR RADHAKRISHNAN OR LINDA HOLLAND. YES AND FOR CLARIFICATION- ISSUE NINE- IS NEXT AND I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS ON ON THE PRIOR ISSUE WE WELCOME ANY ONGOING ENGAGEMENT- AND ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT THE ACTION PLAN. WILL BE UPDATED AND SO WILL CERTAINLY BE CONTRIBUTING TO THAT FROM A DATA PERSPECTIVE AS WELL SO FOR ISSUE NINE WHICH FOCUSES ON CLIMATE AND HEALTH SURVEILLANCE I'LL BEGIN BY SHARING THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS CONSIDERED AS THE GREATEST GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND IS IMPACTING THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIANS ALREADY TODAY. WE SEE THAT FROM INJURY AND ILLNESS TO DEATH FROM WILDFIRES WILDFIRE SMOKE EXTREME HEAT DROUGHT EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS VECTOR BORNE DISEASES AND MENTAL HEALTH IMPACTS AS WELL WE ALSO KNOW THAT THESE HARMS ARE IMPOSED DISPROPORTIONATELY ON LOW INCOME AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN CALIFORNIA. THE PUBLIC HEALTH REQUEST THIRTY POSITIONS AND GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. IN ORDER FOR US TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE NEAR REAL TIME NOTIFICATION FOR PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS FIRST RESPONDERS AND THE COMMUNITY FOR A MERGING OR INTENSIFIED CLIMATE SENSITIVE DISEASES. AND I'LL BRIEFLY MENTION IT'S MORE THAN THE COMMON ONES WE THINK OF LIKE SHEETS ARE WILD FIRE IT ALSO INCLUDES WATER MORE CONDITIONS FOOD WARM CONDITIONS LIKE SALMONELLA E. COLI- IN THE BRIO DOES PORN VALLEY FEVER- AS WELL AS MENTAL HEALTH IMPACTS WHICH IS AN EMERGING AREA OF RESEARCH. THIS BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL IS PART OF A LARGER EFFORT WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENT TO ESTABLISH SYSTEMS FOR EARLY DETECTION OF. HEALTH CONDITIONS IN GENERAL AND THIS. OP B. C. P. FOCUSES ON SPECIFICALLY DETECTING CLIMATE CHANGE RELATED CONDITIONS IMPLEMENTATION WOULD ENTAIL COLLABORATION WITH THE CENTER FOR HEALTH STATISTICS AND INFORMATICS TO ASSURE THAT SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS ARE CONNECTED. TO THAT BROADER CENTER. OUR STATE IS A ONE OF THE FEW STATES IN THE UNITED STATES THAT LACKS A STATEWIDE SYNDROMIC SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM. AND AS A RESULT WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE EXTREMELY COUNTED MRS DURING HEAT WAVES FOR EXAMPLE. I'M DEVELOPING THIS TYPE OF METHOD WOULD ALLOW US TO GET BETTER AT BEING ABLE TO. BOB EARLY IDENTIFICATION FOR EVENTS MONITOR TRENDS TRACKED ILLNESSES AND REPORT TO OFFICIALS AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC. THE FEDERAL CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL ADMINISTERS A PROGRAM CALLED BIO SENSE ALSO KNOWN AS THE NATIONAL SYNDROMIC SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM. AND THIS IS A PROGRAM TO COLLECT ANALYZE AND SHARE ELECTRONIC PATIENT ENCOUNTER DATA RECEIVED THROUGH URGENCY DEPARTMENTS. CURRENTLY WE DO NOT ACTIVELY FACILITATE THE SUBMISSION OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS BUT THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO INITIATE THAT CHANGE. IF THIS IS IMPLEMENTED SUCCESSFULLY EVEN EVERY CHIEF COMPLAINT DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS FROM AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WOULD ENSURE THE AND FUNDS WOULD BE USED TO HELP SUPPORT THESE FACILITIES TO START PROVIDING. THIS TYPE OF CRIME THAT SURVEILLANCE DATA THROUGH THAT PORTAL. ADDITIONALLY DATA COMING FROM THIS PLATFORM CAN BE ANALYZED TRANSFORMED AND DISPLAYED AND MORE USER FRIENDLY WAYS- WE WOULD CONDUCT MODELING TO BE ABLE TO BETTER QUANTIFY THE POTENTIAL REDUCTIONS OF HARMS ANY FOR PREVENTION. AND FUNDING WOULD ALSO HELP SUPPORT THE FEES FOR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS PAY FOR SOME OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED- FINALLY WE WOULD HAVE SOME STAFF AND BETTER THAN OTHER CENTERS ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT TO ALLOW FOR SURVEILLANCE OF OTHER CLIMATE RELATED INFECTIOUS DISEASES. SMOKE HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS AND OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURES AS WELL WE WOULD ALSO ENGAGE A COMMUNICATIONS SPECIALIST TO IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO SHARE THIS WITH THE PUBLIC AND BROAD. POLICYMAKERS AND STAKEHOLDERS. NEXT I BELIEVE WE WILL HAVE LINDA HILL AND FOLLOWED BY SOME NEW PRODUCT. GOOD AFTERNOON THAT CREDIBLE- AND- COMMITTEE I AM MAY I HAVE CARE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT MAY COME UP BUT I DEFERRED TO DOCTOR ABOUT THE CHRISTIAN FOR THE PRESENTATION. SOUNDS GREAT NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM SONYA PADDOCK WITH THE . L. THANK YOU SO PECK L. A. O. WE BELIEVE THIS PROPOSAL REALLY DOES ADDRESS A CURRENT GAP IN THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE RELATED HEALTH EVENTS AND HAS A NUMBER OF MERITS- AS- WE'RE ALL AWARE OF THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WILL CONTINUE TO GROW PARTICULARLY AS THE NUMBER AND SEVERITY OF CLIMATE RELATED EVENTS. INCREASE SO THIS PROPOSAL WOULD HELP THE STATE- PROVIDE REAL TIME ANALYTICS AS DR RADHA KRISHNA- DETAILED ALLOWS FOR THE EARLY DETECTION OF OUTBREAKS IT WILL ALSO INCREASE THE AND ARE THE STATE'S UNDERSTANDING OF THE MAGNITUDE AND POTENTIAL FUTURE MAGNITUDE OF VARIOUS HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE RELATED EVENTS AND HOW THESE IMPACTS AFFECT DIFFERENT GROUPS- AS WELL AS DIFFERENT REGIONS. AND THE VARIOUS DATA COLLECTED COULD FACILITATE ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION OF THE POTENTIAL EFFECTIVENESS OF VARIOUS INTERVENTIONS TAKEN TO REDUCE THE HEALTH IMPACTS. I'M ONE OF THE THINGS THAT APARTMENT ALSO- NOTED TO OUR OFFICE IS THAT PARTICIPATION IN THE BIO SINCE PLATFORM- ENABLES CALIFORNIA TO PARTICIPATE IN A COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE WITH OTHER STATES AND ALSO ENGAGE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS IN THE STATE LEVEL- COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE. AND AS DR RADHAKRISHNA ALSO NOTED CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE ONLY STATES THAT'S NOT ACTIVELY ENGAGED RIGHT NOW. SO THE ONE ISSUE THAT WE WOULD RAISE THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY ABOUT THE DETAILS OF THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL- IS JUST TO NOTE THAT WHILE THIS TYPE OF SURVEILLANCE MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO DETECT ISSUES AND OUTBREAKS EARLY AND TO DO REAL TIME ANALYSIS. IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY DETERMINE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT SO- BEYOND IS SORT OF BEYOND THE NOTIFICATION SO FOR EXAMPLE HOW WILL THE STATE USE THIS INFORMATION IN REAL TIME TO ACTIVATE A RESPONSE BY RELEVANT STATE AND LOCAL PROGRAMS AND SERVICES- AND- OUR OFFICE DOES THINK THIS IS WHAT ALSO MAKES- THE DEPARTMENT SECOND PROPOSAL AND REGIONAL. REGIONAL CLIMATE PLANNING IMPORTANT. THANK YOU WITH THAT'LL BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS REMEMBER QUESTIONS I'LL KEEP IT HERE AS CHAIR. OF MY FIRST QUESTIONS GOING TO BE FOR DR RADHA KRISHNA- REGARDING BIO SENSE I I'D LIKE TO GET A SENSE WHETHER OR NOT THE FEES. HAVE BEEN A BARRIER FOR HOSPITAL PARTICIPATION FIRST AND THEN SECOND- THE FUNDING SEEMS TO BE ONE TIME- IS THERE A NEED FOR ON GOING FUNDING TO ENSURE. AND ENCOURAGE YOUR PARTICIPATION IN BIOSCIENCE. YEAH THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND ALL DEFERRED LINDA HELEN'S TO GIVE A LITTLE MORE DETAIL BUT START BIKE SHARING- FROM OUR REVIEW AND ENGAGEMENT OF FACILITIES AS WELL AS LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AS WELL AS INTERACTING WITH THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND LEARNING FROM OTHER STATES- WE DON'T VIEW THE FEES TO BE. A MAJOR BARRIER CERTAINLY BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT THEM FOR SMALLER FACILITIES AN ONBOARDING WOULD BE OF BENEFIT AND THAT'S WHY WE OUTWEIGH A MODEST AMOUNT OF FUNDS TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THAT BUT REALLY SETTING THE EXPECTATION. THE ONGOING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND- VERY HANDS ON- I. T. SUPPORT IS THE MAIN ISSUE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS AND I'LL JUST CLARIFY WE'RE STILL ON ISSUE NUMBER NINE WHICH IS ONGOING IT'S NOT ONE TIME- SO IT WOULD ALLOW OUR STAFF TO BE ABLE TO. ON BOARD FACILITIES ON A ROLLING BASIS AND WE WOULD START WITH FORTY FIVE EMERGENCY ROOM FACILITIES THAT ALREADY USE THE PLATFORM BUT NOT FOR CLIMATE SPECIFIC CONDITIONS- TO GET THEM THAT THAT HANDS ON TA AND THEN TO CONTINUE THE ROLLOUT FROM THERE. HAPPY TO HAVE LINDA ANSWER ANYMORE QUESTIONS THERE. THANKS I WILL JUST ADD THAT- WE HAVE BEEN CALLING EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO TRY TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES SO FAR- PARTICIPATING IF THEY DO OR WHY THEY HAVE NOT AND- SO FAR WE HAVE NOT GOTTEN A SPENT THE DEFINITIVE NUMBER FROM THEM. ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY HAVE TO PAY OR IF THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD VENDORS SO IT REALLY DOES SEEM TO VARY ACCORDING TO THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD VENDOR. WHETHER OR HOW MUCH THE SECURITY NEEDS TO PAY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CENTER OF THAT SURVEILLANCE MODUL- SO WE'RE FINDING THAT THAT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO PARTICIPATION. AND 71% OF FACILITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY YOU HAVE TO PAY- SO WE EXPECTED ONCE WE GET THE SYSTEM UP AND RUNNING THAT- BE- INCENTIVES INVOLVED IN WHAT WAS CALLED MEANINGFUL USE KNOWLEDGE NOW I'M DATA INTERPRET BILITY THROUGH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. WILL BE SUFFICIENT INCENTIVE FOR MOST FACILITIES TO WANT TO PARTICIPATE AND HAVE THAT DATA FOR THEMSELVES. AND THEIR COMMUNITY IN THEIR OWN TIME. IT WOULD WITH AN- TEN UNDER. TO FOR FOUR ON THE UP. AGENDA IF I CAN WILL USE SOME OF THE RESULTS TO DEVELOP PROTECT PREDICTIVE ANALYTIC MODELS OF FUTURE INCIDENTS OF CONDITIONS SUCH AS HEAT RELATED ILLNESSES AND DEATHS I WAS HOPING YOU COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THIS AND THEN AS THE L. A. O. WAS REFERENCING HOW WE CAN HOPE TO EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE THIS WITH THE PUBLIC TO NOTIFY THEM. OF LET'S SAY EITHER POOR AIR QUALITY OR OF EXTREME HEAT CONDITIONS HOW ARE WE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALIZE THIS IMPLEMENTED. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- AND BEING FROM PUBLIC HEALTH THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO PREVENT- NOT JUST ACCOUNT- SUFFERING OR ILLNESS OR DISEASE OR INJURY IN THE MOMENT SO IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION. I'M I'LL GIVE ONE EXAMPLE THAT COULD PERHAPS BRING TO LIGHT HOW THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION COULD BE USED IN ADDRESS SOME CURRENT SHORTCOMINGS. RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE GOOD ANNUAL VISIBILITY LET ALONE REAL TIME VISIBILITY INTO THE HUMAN HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CONDITIONS AND IF WE JUST TAKE EXTREME HEAT. AS AN EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW WHEN A HEAT WARNING IS ISSUED IT'S BASED ON. OUR AVERAGE TEMPERATURES WHICH DON'T NECESSARILY CORRELATE TO THE IMPACT ON HUMAN HEALTH- AND SO AS WE'RE ABLE TO GET DATA OUT FOR WHAT PARTICULAR THRESHOLDS ARE IMPACT HUMAN HEALTH FROM EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT ENCOUNTERS WERE ABLE BETTER TO BUILD OUR MODELS. TO BE MORE SENSITIVE TO HUMAN HEALTH SPECIFICALLY SO FOR EXAMPLE WE COULD WORK WITH THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE TO HAVE WARNINGS AND NOTIFICATIONS BE MORE ROOTED IN ACTUAL EXPERIENCE OF CALIFORNIANS BEING SENSITIVE TO CLIMATE CHANGES RATHER THAN JUST THE GENERIC- TEMPERATURE AVERAGE- AS I DID BRIEFLY MENTION WE DO HAVE ONE OF THE POSITIONS. DEDICATED FOR A COMMUNICATIONS SPECIALIST NOTING THAT CERTAINLY IN THE FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH WE'RE BUILDING OUT A COMMUNICATIONS TEAM MORE BROADLY. GIVEN THAT THIS IS THE GREATEST PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS OF THE CENTURY HAVING A COMMUNICATION SPECIALIST DEDICATED TO CLIMATE WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT TO HELP CONNECT THE DOTS TO THE BROADER PUBLIC FOR- NOTIFICATION AS WELL AS EARLY WARNINGS. AND YOU KNOW PRACTICES AROUND WE THINK OF FIRST AID IN PREVENTION AND BEING ABLE TO ENGAGE THE PUBLIC FOR A CLIMATE AS WELL WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT I'LL JUST SHARE YOU KNOW MANY OF US ON A- CELL PHONES CAN NOW KNOW WHAT THE AIR QUALITY INDEXES. AS ONE EXAMPLE IN RECENT INNOVATION BUT THERE'S VARIOUS COLOR CODED SCHEMES BASED ON YOUR CERTAIN VULNERABILITIES ON HOW YOU MAY PROTECT YOUR HEALTH- BASED ON AND AN AIR QUALITY INDEX SCORE BUT WE DON'T HAVE THAT. THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING THAT BETTER DATA COULD HELP US BE MORE PRODUCTIVE AND MORE PROACTIVE IN MORE PREVENTIVE MOVING FORWARD. I WILL FOLLOW UP ON THAT EXAMPLE THEN- FRESNO COUNTY HAD THE MOST NUMBER OF BAD AIR QUALITY DAYS OF ANY COUNTY IN THE STATE. HOWEVER WE THAN AFFECTIVELY ABLE TO EDUCATE AND INFORM COMMUNITY WHEN WERE IN THE MIDST OF ONE OF THOSE BAD AIR QUALITY DAYS. AND THEN A FOLLOW UP HOWEVER WE ENSURING I'M PREACHING TO THE CHOIR I'M SURE BUT THEY WERE DOING IT IN A CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY COMPETENT WAY FOR THE DIVERSE CITY OF OUR GREAT STATE- JUST WOULD LOVE TO FOLLOW UP EVEN OFFLINE IF THAT'S. THAT COMES WITH THIS PROPOSAL AND US BEING ABLE TO CLOSER TO REAL TIME BEING ABLE TO. BOTH ACT AND BE INFORMED ABOUT THE SITUATION THAT OUR STATE IS FACING I'M GRATEFUL FOR THIS PROPOSAL AND- WITH THAT I WILL. THANK YOU FOR PRESENTING ON ISSUE NINE AND WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ISSUE TEN- IF WE CAN PLEASE BEGIN AT THE TOP. THANK YOU CHAIR ARAMBULA AND I'LL JUST ADD- CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH POWELL OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH FOR EVERYTHING YOU MENTIONED WILL BE ESSENTIAL MOVING FORWARD FROM MULTIPLE THREATS CURRENTLY WE FOCUS WITH THEM AROUND HEATING COOLING CENTERS AND AIR QUALITY AND- ON THE PLAN TO IN THE FUTURE AS WELL SO THANK YOU FOR. ADDRESSING THE NEED FOR COORDINATION I'M REGARDING ISSUE TEN PUBLIC HEALTH REGIONAL CLIMATE PLANNING. I WANNA INVOKE DIRECTOR ADDED GOLEMS INITIAL COMMENTS THAT THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE WILL ONLY INCREASE IN SCALE SCOPE AND INTENSITY. AND THIS REQUIRES US TO IMMEDIATELY START PLANNING AT A REGIONAL LEVEL FOR THOSE IMPACTS THAT WE CAN ARE YOU SEEN AS YOU MENTIONED IS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTING YOUR DISTRICT. AND REGION OF THE STATE SO THIS PROPOSAL REQUEST GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURE THIRTY OF TWENTY FIVE MILLION. IN TWENTY THOUSAND TWENTY TWO AND TWENTY THREE WHICH IS AVAILABLE FOR ENCUMBRANCE OVER SEVERAL YEARS THROUGH JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE BUT IS A ONE TIME FUNDING. AND THESE RESOURCES WOULD ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE GRANTS TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND TRIBES IN ORDER TO DEVELOP REGIONAL CLIMATE AND HEALTH RESILIENCE PLANTS. IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM WE WOULD ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE ESTABLISH EIGHT POSITIONS AND THE MAJORITY OF THE FUNDS WOULD GO TO GRANTS. ON TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HOW CLIMATE CHANGE AFFECTS. ALL PARTS OF OUR LIVES IT AFFECTS ALL ORGAN SYSTEMS BUT IT GOES BEYOND JUST HUMAN HEALTH AND ALSO AFFECTING BUSINESSES LIVELIHOODS CROPS HOMES CONTRIBUTING TO UNEMPLOYMENT POVERTY AND EVEN DISPLACEMENT IN THE HOUSING CRISIS. SO THE DIRECT IMPACTS AND THE CASCADING EFFECTS AFFECT CHRONIC DISEASE INFECTIOUS DISEASE MENTAL HEALTH. IN THE HEAT AND SMOKE RELATED ILLNESSES WE JUST I'D I'M BEING PERVASIVE AND CROSSED. AND AFFECTING EVERY COMMUNITY AN INDIVIDUAL BUT SOME MORE THAN OTHERS. REALLY WARRANTS TO HELP FOCUSED RESILIENCE PLANNING APPROACH- SO WITH THESE FUNDS WE WOULD SUPPORT LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS CBO'S IN TRIBES TO DEVELOP PLANS AND THIS WOULD BOLSTER THE ACTIONS OF LOCAL HELP JURISDICTIONS THAT STILL MAY BE RESOURCE LIMITED AND HAVING STAFF DEDICATED. TO CLIMATE RESILIENCY WITH THE GOALS AGAIN OF PREVENTING AND REDUCING AN EQUITABLE HEALTH IMPACTS BY BEING BETTER PREPARED. ON THIS FUNDING WOULD ALLOW EACH OF THE FIVE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER REGION'S TO WRITE AT LEAST ONE CLIMATE CHANGE AND HEALTH RESILIENCE PLAN THAT WOULD BE COORDINATED BY ONE TO TWO. LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS FROM THAT REGION. ONE OR TWO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WOULD BE SELECTED TO LEAD THESE REGIONAL PLANS IN THE PROCESS AND WILL BE SELECTED BASED ON A PROCESS THAT PRIORITIZES. GREATEST CLIMATE AND HEALTH INEQUITIES AS MEASURED BY THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHY PLACES INDEX. WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM OUR DEPARTMENT AWARDEES WOULD HELP RIGHT THE PLANS AND ADDRESS PRIORITY CLIMATE CHANGE AND HEALTH EQUITY IMPACTS IDENTIFIED BY A VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT. TO IMPROVE THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND HELP BOLSTER CLIMATE RESILIENCY REGIONAL COALITIONS CONVENTIONS INTERVENTIONS FROM A LIST OF BEST PRACTICES PROVIDED FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE. INCLUDING POLICY OBJECTIVES FOR LONGER TERM CHANGE THIS PLAN WOULD INCLUDE METRICS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PROCESS AND OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDING ENGAGEMENT IN THE COMMUNITY FOR THE PLANNED DEVELOPMENT. I'M ALL AND MY NOTING- WHILE THIS IS A ONE TIME FUNDING AND WON'T BE ENOUGH FOR ALL JURISDICTIONS AND ALL ASPECTS OF POTENTIAL IMPLEMENTATION IT WOULD BE A STRONG START FOR REGIONAL LEVEL PLANNING. WITH TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THANK YOU WE WILL HEAR FOR LINDA AND. HELLO AGAIN I'LL JUSTICE FOR CONDUCTOR- RATHER CHRISTIAN OFFERED UP PRESENTATIONS AND BIGGER TERRIFIED TO COST. NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM SONYA PADDOCK WITH YELLOW THANK YOU SENATE PECK FROM THE L. A. O- WE WANT TO. TAKE A STEP BACK FOR A MOMENT AND JUST NOTE THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS IN THE CDPH BUDGET THIS YEAR THAT REQUEST ONE TIME FUNDING FOR A SPECIFIC PURPOSE INCLUDING THIS ONE- OTHER ONE TIME PROPOSALS WILL BE DISCUSSED LATER IN THE YEAR GENDO INCLUDING BOOKS FOR CHILDREN IN THE WITH PROGRAM- SUPPORT FOR THE FITNESS COUNCIL GRANTS FOR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE PROGRAMS. ETCETERA AND THESE ONE TIME APPROPRIATIONS MAY MAKE SENSE THIS YEAR FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS INCLUDING THE FACT THAT THE STATE CURRENTLY HAS A DISCRETIONARY BUDGET SURPLUS. BUT NO GUARANTEE THAT REVENUES WILL REMAIN AT THAT LEVEL- AS YOU ARE LIKELY AWARE OUR OFFICE REGULARLY CAUTIONS AGAINST OVER COMMITTING FUNDING TO ONGOING PROGRAMS DURING GOOD TIMES IF IT CANNOT REALISTICALLY SUSTAIN THOSE STRENGTH DURING THE DOWNTURN. CAN ALSO MAKE SENSE IF THE DEPART IF A DEPARTMENT WANTS TO TEST A PROGRAM ON A LIMITED BASIS TO SEE IF IT BRINGS VALUE WOULD NOTE THAT SUCH ONE TIME AUGMENTATIONS CONTINUE THE HISTORIC TREND OF PROVIDING ONLY LIMITED. SHORT TERM FUNDING FOR PUBLIC HEALTH- SO. WE RAISE THIS ISSUE JUST TO SAY THAT WE WOULD MAINLY SUGGEST MAKING SURE THAT ONE TIME FUNDING PROPOSALS EITHER LEVERAGE EXISTING RESOURCES OR LAY A FOUNDATION THAT CAN BE USED IN THE FUTURE. WHICH APPEARS. IN OUR APPEARS THAT THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL IS TRYING TO DO THAT- ON THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL WE THINK IT DOES HAVE MERITS WERE AWARE THAT MANY LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE STAFF FOR EXPERTISE TO CONDUCT PLANNING RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE. I'M HOWEVER WE DO HAVE A COUPLE OF CONCERNS THAT WE WOULD RAISE THAT THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WISH TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT- SO FIRSTOF ALL- AT RIGHT AT THE END THEIR DOCTOR WROTE A CHRISTIAN I MENTIONED THE FACT THAT THESE PLANS ARE AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL AND DON'T GO TO EVERY LOCAL HOLD JURISDICTION BUT AT LEAST IT'S A GOOD START. OUR CONCERN- WITH THIS EVEN THOUGH CLIMATE CHANGE IS SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T- RESPECT LOCAL JURISDICTION BOUNDARIES- ARE CONCERNED REALLY IS- WHETHER THE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS THAT DON'T RECEIVE THE FUNDING. WILL BE FULLY ENGAGED IN THE REGIONAL PLAN ESPECIALLY IF THEY DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE THE CAPACITY AND THEN DON'T GET THE FUNDING THROUGH THIS GRANT PROGRAM- SECOND IT'S UNCLEAR- THIS SORT OF WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THESE PLANS ARE DEVELOPED SO FOR EXAMPLE WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED BY THE STATE. WHAT OVERSIGHT WOULD OCCUR. AND PER OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT- IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WOULD HAVE TO DESIGN ACTIVITIES THAT COULD BE CONDUCTED WITH EXISTING RESOURCES- HOWEVER THAT OBVIOUSLY LIMITS THE EXTENT. OF WHAT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED AND WHAT ACTIVITIES CAN BE UNDERTAKEN TO REDUCE THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THANK YOU WITH THAT I'LL BRING IT UP TO THE DIRE SO I WILL- KEEP IT HERE AT THE CHAIR. I'D I'D LIKE TO- I DIG INTO THE AGENDA A LITTLE BIT ON PAGE FORTY SEVEN OF OUR AGENDA ON THE FOURTH. BULLET YOU LIST THAT THERE ARE SOME BEST PRACTICES WHICH WILL BE PROVIDED BY CD P. H. I WAS HOPING YOU COULD GIVE SOME EXAMPLES OF THOSE. AND THEN I WAS WANTING TO SEE IF- YOU ARE GOING TO SUGGEST SPECIFIC METRICS WITH THOSE BEST PRACTICES TO THE REGIONAL PLANS. AS SUGGESTED METRICS TO TRACK AND FOLLOW- IF YOU COULD GIVE SOME EXAMPLES OF THOSE AS WELL WOULD BE GREAT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTIONS I'LL START AND THEN ASK LINDA HELEN TO PROVIDE MORE DETAILS- THE QUESTION ASKED ABOUT BEST PRACTICES AND THEN SUGGESTED METRICS. AND ALL ALL SHARE THAT PART OF THE REASON WE'RE PROPOSING THIS WITHIN THE CLIMATE CHANGE AND HEALTH EQUITY SECTION TO LEAD IT IS OUR TEAM- FOR ALMOST A DECADE NOW. HAS DONE THIS WORK FOR MANY OTHER AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS IN TERMS OF SHARING BEST PRACTICES AND SUGGESTED PROCESS AND OUTCOME MEASURES AROUND HOW TO BOTH INCLUDE AND MONITOR. THE HEALTH AND EQUITY ASPECTS OF CLIMATE RELATED POLICY AND PLANNING THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'VE DONE OVER OVER MANY YEARS AS LEVERAGE THE PLANS IN THE TOOLS AND THE DOLLARS F OTHER AGENCIES. CAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY CAL NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH AND OTHERS AND THIS WOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO NOW SURE THAT SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE WITH OUR OWN WITH THE REGION'S IN THE SIXTY ONE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS AND I'LL PASS IT TO LINDA WHO HELPED WRITE. MANY OF THOSE PLANS CHAPTERS AND PROPOSED METRICS TO GO INTO MORE DETAIL. THANK YOU YES SOME. EXAMPLES OF BEST PRACTICES INCLUDE- AND- AS MISCONDUCT POINTED OUT COLLABORATING WITH THE FACILITIES AND NOT AND OTHER LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO OPERATIONALIZE THE DATA THAT COME FROM THAT PROPOSED SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM. TO DO THINGS LIKE AND DOCTOR OF THE CHRISTMAS AND WORK WITH THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE OR EVEN AT JUST BELOW THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT MOBILE TO. ISSUE ALERT LIKE EXTREME HEAT ALERT- WHEN THEY'RE WHEN THE TEMPERATURE REACHES A THRESHOLD IT MAKES THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THERE ARE HEALTH IMPACTS IN THAT LOCAL POPULATION BASED ON THEIR GEOGRAPHY AND WATER PHILIPPINES. BUT THAT- BASED ON HISTORICAL TEMPERATURES WOULD NOT NORMALLY TRIGGER HEAT UP A LARGE. ONE WORKING TOGETHER Q. BUT THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO ESTABLISH THINGS SUCH AS THE COOL BUDDY PROGRAM WHEREBY LOCAL HELP. LOCAL COMMITTEE BASED ORGANIZATIONS IDENTIFY A CLIMATE VULNERABLE PEOPLE BY FOR EXAMPLE SENIORS LIVING ALONE OR PEOPLE ON THE TOP FLOORS OF. APARTMENTS ARE PEOPLE WHO. DO NOT HAVE OR CANNOT AFFORD TO RUN THEIR CONDITIONING- PEOPLE DEPENDENT ON- ELECTRICAL AND VENTILATION OR OTHER- BUT MEDICAL DEVICES. AND IT IN THIS COOL BUDDY PROGRAM THE- LOOK AT THAT- COMMITTEE BASED ORGANIZATION. DEVELOPS A CADRE OF PEOPLE THAT THAT THAT HELP Q. FIVE P. PREVENTION BUT THE PERSON AND GET THEM WEATHERNATION SERVICES AND- THE PERSONAL COOLING THEIR SERVICEMEN'S. YOU'RE CONDITIONING A POSSIBLE AND WHEN THERE IS A HUGE EVENT TO GO CHECK ON THEM AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE OKAY- BRING THEM SUPPORT FOR EVACUATE THEM IF. NEED BE- OTHER BEST PRACTICES INCLUDE- CONTRIBUTING HEALTH AND EQUITY CONTENT TO THE LOCAL CLIMATE ACTION PLAN OR AT THE LOCAL GENERAL PLAN PROCESS- TO THE- ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ELEMENT OF THE DINNER PLAN FOR- INTERVIEWED CIRCULAR OR AND- WHAT DEPEND WALKING BASED PLAN I. YOU LOOK HOW THEY MEDICAID PLAN- ALSO UTILIZED TO WE HAVE A- OF- AT DATA DRIVEN TRUE THAT ARE FOR. SENSE TRACT THE CLIMATE EXPERT POPULATION TO IN THE DAY CAN PRODUCTION. THAT MADE HER RISK COURT RELATED HEALTH HARM IT'S A USABLE THE TOOLS EXAMPLE TO HELP HER. QUESTIONS FOR BERMAN AND GREENING OR WORSE STRUCTURE MIGHT MIGHT BE MOST ME FOR TRAN FOR EXAMPLE- TO- I TO WORK WITH LOCAL WARRANTED AND RECREATION THE PUBLIC WORKS- TO BRING THE EVIDENCE AND DATA INVOLVING ABILITY ASSESSMENTS TO PROMOTE CLIMBERS BILLION INFRASTRUCTURE NATURE BASED SOLUTION- WE WOULD HELP THEM- I CAN TAX COMMUNITY CLIMATE CHANGE AND HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENTS AND THEN DEVELOP PLANS OUT ON THAT REGIONAL BASIS- THAT THEY WOULD AND HOPEFULLY GET YOU IMPLEMENTED THERE WERE OFFERED THE FUNDING- OR EVEN START TO IMPLEMENT. DURING THIS THREE YEAR ROUND. I WOULD LIKE TO FILE UP NOW ON FORTY SIX OF THE AGENDA UNDER THE BACKGROUND SECOND PARAGRAPH DOWN. IT STATES THAT CDPH CURRENTLY HAS STAFF THAT'S DEDICATED TO ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE AND HEALTH. AND IT WORKS TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO OTHER STATE AGENCIES TO EMBED HEALTH INTO THEIR CLIMATE RELATED PROGRAMS. I WAS HOPING TO FOLLOW UP SPECIFICALLY ON EITHER AB SIX ONE SEVEN OF PRIORITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE. AND OR TCC TO FIGURE OUT WHICH HEALTH RELATED METRICS- WE WERE FOLLOWING TO EVALUATE THOSE CLIMATE- RELATED PROGRAMS. THANK YOU CHAIR ARAMBULA ALL I'LL SHARE COMING FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL IN THE RICHMOND SAN PABLO AREA ONE OF THE SITES FOR A. B. SIX ONE SEVEN COMMUNITY AIR MONITORING IN POLLUTION REDUCTION. AND HAVING SERVED ON ALL LOCAL STEERING COMMITTEE- IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT ONE WHERE THAT THE HEALTH VOICE CAN REALLY ADD VALUE TO WHAT'S BEING TRACK WHEN THERE'S A VARIETY OF COMPETING INTERESTS WHEN IT'S IMPORTANT TO MEASURE ATTRIBUTABLE RISK FOR A PARTICULAR SOURCE- THAT'S CONTRIBUTING TO THE HEALTH HARMS. ON THE EXAMPLE OFTEN COMES UP IS THAT WELL WAS THAT IS MY FROM A. B. OR C. THAT LEADS SOMEONE TO BE IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM- AND CERTAINLY OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL- GIVES- SOME HISTORY TO OUR INVOLVEMENT WITH TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE COMMUNITIES ARE TCC. AGAIN I'M GOING TO DEFER TO LINDA WHOSE- REALLY HELPED BUILD A LOT OF THE CONTRIBUTION OF METRICS AND SUPPORT FOR OUR PRESIDENCY. PARTNERS TO GO INTO MORE DETAIL FOR YOU. THANK YOU AND I AM NOT ACTUALLY RECALLING THE SPECIFIC METRICS THAT WE- PROVIDED TO YOU AND BENT INTO THE TWO FIFTY PROGRAM- OR EIGHTY SIX POINT SEVEN BUT WE DO IN A SENSE OF WHAT NUMBER. ONE EARLY LIKE FIFTEEN DIFFERENT STUFF STATE PROGRAMS INTO WHICH WE HAVE WORKING AND THAT HEALTH INEQUITY METRICS- AND CONSIDERATION BY LANGUAGE AND TOOLS- SO THEY. WOULD BE THINGS LIKE- I SWEAR THAT ROPE. GENUINE NOTHING COMMUNITY. AND ENGAGEMENT AND DEVELOPING THE PLANS- I THINK WE HELPED- CONSOLE DEVELOPED- CRITERIA FOR ASSESSING AND- AND REACH UP TO MEANING GAUGE MEANT- THINGS LIKE HEALTHY FOOD ACCESS- RIGHT ABOUT PROMOTING HEALTH THROUGH URBAN COMMUNITY GREENING OUR LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT- FOR STRATEGIES THAT USE THOSE TO CLEAN THE WATER AND CLEAN AIR AND PROVIDE SHADING AND REDUCE HEAT ISLAND EFFECTS- SO I DON'T HAVE A PRETTY GOOD SENSE OF READING FOR THE CONCEPT- B. B. R. ON. THAT KIND OF INDICATOR. I MAY UP FOR- A LEVEL OF DETAIL ON EACH OF THOSE PROGRAMS- BUT NOW WILL TURN TO ASK IS THERE AN APPROPRIATE TIME FOR US TO DO AN ANALYSIS OF THOSE PROGRAMS. HOW MANY YEARS AFTER THE INITIATION OF SIX ONE SEVEN OR AFTER TCC- SHOULD WE BE COMPARING TO THE BASELINE TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS A TREND THAT'S GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. FIVE YEARS. THE FIVE YEAR YES IS IT TEN YEARS HOW LONG. YEAH THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND- I THINK WE WOULD NEED TO. COLLABORATE WITH SOME OF OUR PARTNER CERTAINLY THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD ETA- AND MANY OTHERS THAT WE WORK WITH AROUND THAT TIME HORIZON FOR EVALUATION NOT SURE LINDA IF YOU HAVE A COMMENT THERE. I WILL I KNOW THAT THE UCLA LUSKIN CENTER HAS DONE EVALUATIONS I BELIEVE THEY'RE PART OF THE HONDA FAMILY COMMUNITY PROGRAM AGAIN EITHER HE TOOK A COUPLE PROGRAMS NOT OUR PROGRAMS- BUT- THAT HAS HAD GREAT. EFFECT IN COMMUNITIES WHERE THE FUNDING HAS GONE IN TERMS OF. IMPROVING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AS WELL AS REDUCING EMISSIONS AND- AGAIN I DON'T HAVE THE DATA RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME BUT- I DIDN'T THINK WITHIN FIVE YEARS WE CAN'T WE CAN'T- I HAVE SOME REALLY MEANINGFUL. HEALTH IMPROVEMENTS AND- AND POSITIVE HEALTH IMPATS. FROM THESE HUGE INVESTMENT. I WOULD- I'M I'M RETICENT IT BUT I FEEL OBLIGATED TO AS WELL- THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY HAS NEVER REACHED ATTAINMENT TO THE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN STANDARDS TO THE TWO THOUSAND SIX STANDARDS TO THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE STANDARDS THAT AT SOME POINT WHEN WE HEAR ABOUT THE ASTHMA RATES WE DO IN OUR COMMUNITY WE HAVE TO QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT IT'S HAPPENING FAST ENOUGH FOR COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE. AND SO I THINK THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HEARING FROM US THE WANTING TO TRACK AND TREND AND FOLLOW THEDATA TO SEE THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE OCCURRING IN A COMMUNITY SAYS LIKE MINE AND SO WITH THAT I WILL THANK VERY MUCH THIS PANEL AND- ON ISSUE TEN AND WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO PANEL SIX WHICH WILL COVER FIVE PROPOSALS UNDER THE CENTER FOR HEALTHY COMMUNITIES. WE WILL HAVE THREE PRESENTERS WHO ARE ON THIS PANEL BEGINNING WITH MONEY- CHIRLA ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR- FOR THE CENTER OPERATIONS WITH THE CENTER FOR HEALTHY COMMUNITIES DR DIANA RAMOS THE ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION AT WITH THE CENTER FOR HEALTHY COMMUNITIES AND FINALLY DOCTOR HAROLD GOLDSTINE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES WHO WILL BE COMMENTING JUST ON ISSUE FOURTEEN. AGAIN WE WILL PAUSE FOR QUESTIONS AFTER EACH PROPOSAL IS PRESENTED LET US BEGIN WITH MONEY- CHAU. MARIA I AM WITH H. C. M. WANTED THIS DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND WILL BE PROVIDING UPDATES TODAY ISSUE ELEVEN AND TWELVE. SO THE FIRST ONE IS FOR SB SIX ONE NINE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REFLECTS FUNDING TO IMPLEMENT AB SIX ONE NINE AIR QUALITY. THE FREQUENCY SEVERITY AND DURATION OF WILD SMOKE WILDFIRES SMOKE EVENTS HAVE INCREASED DRAMATICALLY IN CALIFORNIA EXPOSING MILLIONS TO DANGEROUSLY UNHEALTHY AIR. THIS REQUEST WOULD GIVE CDPH THE NECESSARY RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE PROVISIONS OF AB SIX ONE NINE AND ADDRESS THE NEED FOR CONSOLIDATED GUIDANCE ON PROTECTIVE HEALTH MEASURES. THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN IN THE CASE OF A SIGNIFICANT AIR QUALITY BACK CAUSED BY WILDFIRES OR OTHER SOURCES. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REFLECTS AN INCREASE OF FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND IN GENERAL FUND STATE OPERATIONS. THE INCREASE SUPPORTS THREE POSITIONS TO CREATE AND MAINTAIN AN AIR QUALITY PLAN AS MANDATED BY AB SIX ONE NINE. THE FUNDING OFFICE ON GOING. CDPH CREATE AN AUTHORITY OF AN UPDATED AIR QUALITY HEALTH PLAN AND CONSOLIDATED GUIDANCE AND CONSULTATION WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM OTHER STATE AGENCIES. APPROPRIATE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AIR POLLUTION DISTRICTS CITIES COUNTIES HOSPITALS AND VARIOUS ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS. CITY PH WILL IDENTIFY CURRENT INFORMATION SURROUNDING SMOKE EXPOSURE AND HUMAN HEALTH AS WELL AS MAINTAIN COUNTY LEVEL INFORMATION ON RESOURCE SHORTAGES AND NEEDS. CITY PH WELL ANALYZE COUNTY RESOURCE NEEDS AND ASSESS AND PACKED OF WILDFIRE SMOKE ON POPULATION HEALTH. CITY CREWS WILL PERFORM AND CONSULT ON OUTREACH IN MATERIALS DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO COMMUNICATION REGARDING HEALTH PROTECTION DURING ROCK ARE INTENSE. CITY PH AND PROVIDE CONSULTATION ON RISK ASSESSMENT SELECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND OTHER EXPOSURE REDUCTION MEASURES. THANK YOU. ESCHEWS I WOULD TAKE THOSE NOW. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM DR DIANA RAMOS. ACTUALLY I WILL BE PROVIDING THE UPDATES ON ISSUES ELEVEN AND TWELVE SHE WILL BE PROVIDING UPDATES ON THE REMAINING ISSUES SOUNDS GREAT- FOR THIS ISSUE CAN YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN HOW THE STATE NOTIFIES THE PUBLIC ABOUT POOR AIR QUALITY THREATS. FOLLOWING UP ON THE QUESTION WE JUST HAD FROM BEFORE HOW DO YOU EXPECT FOR THIS TO IMPROVE IN THE FUTURE AS A RESULT OF AB SIX ONE NINE. SO CITY PH WILL ACTUALLY BE WORKING AND CONSULTATION WITH VARIOUS STAKEHOLDER GROUPS AND PROVIDING. THEM TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR COUNTIES TO USE AN ACCEPTED A PLAN. AND THEY WILL BE WORKING WITH THE COUNTIES TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION OUT TO THE PUBLIC. SOUNDS GREAT WITH THAT LET'S NOW MOVE ON TO ISSUE TWELFTH. OKAY THANK YOU SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REFLECTS FUNDING TO IMPLEMENT AB TEN NINETY FOUR A PILOT PROJECT TO COLLECT DATA ON THE SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY DATA FILE CONTESTS SUCH AS HOMICIDE AND SUICIDE ARE LEADING CAUSES OF PREMATURE DEATH AND ARE MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS AND YEARS OF LIFE LOST DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. ON YOUNG PEOPLE. THE LGBT COMMUNITY AS AT HIGHER RISK FOR VIOLENT BEST BUT DATA IS LIMITED ON THIS POPULATION WHICH LIMITS EFFORTS TO PREVENT THESE DEATHS. ROUTINELY COLLECTING DATA ON SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTIFICATION OF DECEDENTS AND CONSISTENT MANNER IS A CRITICAL STEP IN FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE DEPTH OF THIS PROBLEM AND GUIDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF METHODS TO PREVENT DEATHS. AMONG THE LGBT POPULATION. WELL THE CALIFORNIA VIOLENT DEATH REPORTING SYSTEM IS STRUCTURED TO COLLECT SEXUAL ORIENTATION GENDER IDENTIFICATION DATA THAT DATA IS ONLY AVAILABLE WHEN IT'S PROVIDED FROM PRIMARY PRIMARY DATE RESOURCES SUCH AS THE CORONER MEDICAL EXAMINER. OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT REPORTS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REFLECTS A ONE TIME INCREASE OF FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE THOUSAND TOTAL FUNDING. AT THIS THREE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE THOUSAND AND GENERAL FUND STATE OFFICE AND TWO HUNDRED TWELVE THOUSAND AND LOCAL LISTINGS DANCE. TO ESTABLISH AND ADMINISTER A THREE YEAR SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY DATA COLLECTION PILOT PROJECT AB TEN NINETY FOUR. THE PILOT PROJECT WILL BE IN UP TO SIX COUNTIES TO ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH CDPH FOR TRAINING CORONERS AND MEDICAL EXAMINERS ON THE IDENTIFICATION AND COLLECTION OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION. AND GENDER ID DATA IN CASES OF VIOLENT DEATHS SUCH AS HOMICIDES AND SUICIDES. IN INDIVIDUALS WHO IDENTIFY AS LGBTQ. WHAT'S SELECTION OF AT LEAST ONE COUNTY FROM EACH OF THE NORTHERN SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL REGIONS IN CALIFORNIA AND CONSIDERATION OF REPRESENTATION OF URBAN RURAL AND SUBURBAN AREAS. CDPH EXPECTS TO INCREASE PERCENTAGES OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION INFORMATION ACCURATELY COLLECTED PRESS TRAINING AND INCREASED THE KNOWLEDGE OF COUNTY STAFF REGARDING THE COLLECTION OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION DATA INFORMATION. CITY PH WILL REIMBURSE COUNTIES FOR THE COSTA PARTICIPATING IN TRAININGS AND IMPLEMENTING CHANGES TO CURRENT PARTNER MEDICAL EXAMINER TOOLS AND SYSTEMS TO PARTICIPATE. AND THE PILOT PROJECT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU- FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK CDPH FOR WORKING SO CLOSELY WITH MY STAFF ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS MODEL- PRIOR TO IT BEING CHAPTER WE HAD SUBMITTED A LETTER TO THE JOURNAL IN WHICH I HAD EXPRESSED THE LEGISLATORS TO HAVE THE FOLLOWING FOR COUNTIES INCLUDED IN THE PILOT PROGRAM FRESNO LOS ANGELES STANISLAUS AND SANTA CLARA COUNTIES. WHAT CRITERIA CDPH USING TO DETERMINE WHICH COUNTIES WILL BE ENGAGING IN THIS PILOT. SO THEY WILL BE USING IT I WILL BE USING A COMBINATION OF DATA AND ALSO LOOKING AT CURRENT INVOLVEMENT AND- COUNTIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING IN AND THE CALIFORNIA VIOLENT DEATH REPORTING SYSTEM. AND JUST LOOKING AT COUNTY'S WILLINGNESS AND ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PILOT PROJECT SO WHAT WE'RE STILL WORKING ON ALL THE DETAILS RIGHT NOW. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE- CONSISTENT COMMUNICATION WITH MY STAFF- WITH THAT I WILL THANK YOU AND WHAT'S PLEASE PRESENTS NOW ON ISSUE THIRTEEN. YOUR. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU MY NAME IS DR DIANA RAMOS AND I AM THE ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION AND THE CENTER FOR HEALTHY COMMUNITIES ISSUE THIRTEEN ALPHA LIMA FIRST HEALTHY BRAIN INITIATIVE PCP THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH REQUEST WHAT TIME FUNDING IN THE AMOUNT OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION AND LOCAL ASSISTANCE AND ONE POINT FIVE MILLION IN STATE OPERATION. IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE BUT PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE FOR FUNDS TO BE AVAILABLE UNTIL JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THE ALLOCATE GRANTS TO AN ADDITIONAL SIX HELICOPTERS LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS PARTICIPATING IN THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHY BRAIN INITIATIVE CURRENTLY THERE ARE SIX LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS PARTICIPATING IN THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHY BRAIN INITIATIVE PILOT PROGRAM ALLOF WHICH ARE CREATING PROGRAMS THAT MEET THE NEEDS. OF THEIR SPECIFIC JURISDICTION. EIGHTY PH WITH A KERR FOR APPLICATION. FOR A LOT HEALTH JURISDICTION. THE LOCAL JURISDICTION RECEIVING THE FUNDS SHOWING. ALL OF THE FOLLOWING FUNDAMENTAL PLANNING PRINCIPLE. ELIMINATING HEALTH DISPARITIES COLLABORATING ACROSS MULTIPLE SECTORS AND LEVERAGING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE RESOURCES FOR SUSTAINED IMPACT. WE WILL CONTINUE USING THE CDC HEALTHY BRAIN INITIATIVE ROADMAP WHICH OUTLINES THE AGENDA OF ACTION FOR STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES AND THEIR PARTNERS TO PROMOTE BRAIN HEALTH BETTER CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT. INCREASED ATTENTION TO CARE GIVERS AND BILL PUBLIC HEALTH PATH TO BE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE D√çAS FOR QUESTIONS- I CAN'T I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE IN THE FIRST ROUND OF GRANTS THAT THERE ARE- WERE. BOTH NO INLAND EMPIRE OR CENTRAL VALLEY LOCATIONS WHICH WERE CHOSE AND I AM WONDERING WHETHER OR NOT- THERE WAS ANYTHING THAT PREVENTED OR DISCOURAGED THESE COUNTIES FROM APPLYING. AND THEN HOW WILL WE ENSURE. THAT THEY APPLY IN THE NEXT ROUND WILL WE BE DOING SPECIFIC OUTREACH WILL WE BE PROVIDING TA. TO HELP THEM TO OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS AND APPLYING. SO JURISDICTIONS WERE INVITED TO APPLY- WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS STARTED IN TWENTY TWENTY AND COALBED IMPACTED. PARTICIPATION CAPACITY AT ALL LEVELS BUT ABSOLUTELY THE CRITERIA- WILL IT DOES INCLUDE ROLE PARTICIPATION AND WE HOPE TO INCLUDE A DIVERSE OF REPRESENTATION AND ENCOURAGE. AS AS YOU HAD RECOMMENDED WORK OF LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS THAT WILL BE REFLECTIVE OF ALL. SECTORS OF THE STATE. I THINK I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE TO ENCOURAGE OUTREACH AND TA TECH COUNTIES. TO- HELP THEM IN APPLYING IT IT- THEY MAY HAVE HAD BARRIERS DURING THE PANDEMIC BUT AS WE'RE GOING FORWARD- I WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE AS WAS ORIGINALLY IN THE- INITIAL B. C. P. THAT WE FOCUS BOTH ON RURAL AND SOME OF OUR UNDERSERVED PORTIONS OF OUR STATE SO- WOULD HOPE THAT THESE ADDITIONAL SIX JURISDICTIONS WOULD TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT. THANK YOU FOR THAT RECOMMENDATION RIVER WE SURE CHECK WITH. THANK YOU I WILL NOW HAVE US MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FOURTEEN DOCTOR GOLDSTINE WHEN YOU'RE READY. PICTURE WHAT HAVE WHAT WE HAVE THE FIRST- LET'S BEGIN EXCUSE ME LET'S KEEP WITH DARK- DOCTOR. I THINK DOCTOR DIANA RAMOS. YEAH THANK YOU THE FOURTEENTH AS THE BUSINESS COUNCIL PCP DPH REQUEST A ONE TIME INCREASE OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND IN STATE OPERATE AT THE PORT OF A NURSE ADVISORY COUNCIL ON PHYSICAL FITNESS AND MENTAL WELL BEING. IF INCREASE INCLUDES PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE WITH INCOME RENTS OR EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY. UNTIL JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. IN JUNE TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE GOVERNOR'S ADVISORY COUNCIL ON PHYSICAL FITNESS AND MENTAL- ARE YOU AT AND- MENTAL HEALTH WELL BEING WAS COURT AND IS BEING LED BY THE FIRST PARTNER WITH AN EMPHASIS ON ADVANCING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND MENTAL WELLNESS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. EPA TO OVERSEE THE COORDINATION OF THE COUNCIL THE HIGH LEVEL FACILITATION AND CROSS SECTOR COMMUNICATIONS REPORT COUNCIL DEVELOPMENT AND ENGAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. OVERSEE CONTRACTS FOR BOTH EVENT PLANNING AND SOCIAL MARKETING CAMPAIGNS. OVERSEE PREPARATION OF AN ANNUAL REPORT SB THE LAYERS OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND ALL APPROPRIATE STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS. WE WILL ALSO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR COUNCIL MEETINGS AS WELL AS TECHNICAL ASSISTANT CONFERENCE AND TRAINING SERVICES. EXECUTIVE COMPREHENSIVE SOCIAL MARKETING CAMPAIGNS IN DESIGNATED MEDIA MARKET AND COMMUNITY STATEWIDE. IDENTIFY EVALUATION STRATEGIES TO MEASURE CHANGING ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIOR AND IMPLEMENT ACTIVITIES THE MEASURE THE FACT THAT SOCIAL MARKETING CAMPAIGNS HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN DOLLARS AND IN TWENTY. TWO TO TWENTY FIVE FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO COORDINATE THE GOVERNOR'S BUSINESS COUNCIL AND EIGHT POINT SIX MILLION OVER THREE YEARS FOR SOCIAL MARKETING CAMPAIGN AND DESIGNATED STYLE MEDIA MARKET AND COMMUNITY STATEWIDE- FIFTY THOUSAND WOULD BE TO SUPPORT THE COUNCIL A CONTRACT WITH SACRAMENTO STATE. FOR LOGISTICAL ADMINISTRATIVE AND COMMUNICATION REPORT. AND THERE WERE QUESTIONS THAT WERE- BROUGHT UP. DO YOU WANT ME TO ADDRESS VOEPEL YES PLEASE. OKAY THE FIRST QUESTION WAS HOW MANY RESEARCH BEEN DONE TO PREPARE EFFICACY OF PROMOTING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY A PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN. AND OVERALL THERE IS CURRENTLY INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO DETERMINE WHETHER MASS MEDIA CAMPAIGNS INCREASED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND- FITNESS. BUT RESEARCH HAS SUGGESTED THAT MASS MEDIA MADE HIM FOR THE PERFECT TYPE IS THE COLLECTIVITY SUCH AS WALKING- AND THE OTHER-IS FOR- SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGNS ARE ALSO INCREASINGLY BEING USED TO PROMOTE HEALTH AND OFFER DISTINCT ADVANTAGES OVER TRADITIONAL MEDIA INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO TARGET SPECIFIC SUBGROUP. GENERATE INCREASED SOCIAL SUPPORT AWARENESS AND INFLUENCE SOCIAL NORMS. WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN USING SOCIAL MEDIA- FOR THE PRE DIABETES CAMPAIGN HERE IN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THIS WOULD BE A CONTINUE ON THAT TRAJECTORY FOR THE WORK THAT WE'VE ALREADY DONE AND THE SPEED DIABETES. CAMPAIGN CAN NOW BE THE BRIDGE FOR- THAT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND MENTAL HEALTH. THE OTHER QUESTION IS ACCORDING TO RESEARCH WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON BARRIERS TO PEOPLE ENGAGING IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. SO- IF YOU THINK THE MOST COMMON BARRIERS OVERALL ARE WITH RESPECT TO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND EXERCISE OF LACK OF TIME IT'S LIKE OF EXERCISING FEELING TOO TIRED LACK OF COMPANY AND LACK OF MONEY- SEARCHING ON ON HIGH OVERVIEW RESEARCH AMONG LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS ARE PROJECTS THAT LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS MAY PRESENT ADDITIONAL BARRIERS TO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY INCLUDING LACK OF RESOURCES THAT SUPPORT ACTIVITY LACK OF WELL MAINTAINED PATHS ARE PARTS AND PERCEPTION OF COMMUNITY LIKE WHAT. AND LACK OF FAITH YOUR PERCEPTION OF DISORDER OR CRIME A LACK OF SAFETY OFTEN REPORTED VERY YOUR MIND- BATTERIES AFRICAN AMERICAN AND HISPANIC ADOLESCENT AND. ADULT AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. SOME OF WOMEN REPORT LACK OF TRUST. AND LOCAL OF OPPORTUNITY. WE'RE ALSO. CHECK THAT THE PROACTIVE. AND THEN THE FINAL QUESTION IS HOW DOES THE PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN ADDRESS THOSE #RIERS MEDIA AND IN PARTICULAR SOCIAL MEDIA CAN BE USED TO ALERT INDIVIDUALS THE COMMUNITY OPPORTUNITIES FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BOTH YOUR PERCEPTION SOCIAL FOR INFLUENCE NORMS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BOOSTS SELF EFFICACY AND DISPEL MYTHS REGARDING POTENTIAL THREATS- THE OTHER THING TO HIGHLIGHT IS THAT ARE. IN IN OUR COMMUNITY OUT WOULD ALSO BE PROVIDED THE MEDIA CAMPAIGN WHERE I CAN THINK OF CORPORATE A STRONG MENTAL HEALTH COMPONENT WERE LINKED TO MULTIPLE RESOURCES AND ACTIVITIES- AT THAT THE COUNCIL WILL BE DEVELOPING AND WE KNOW THAT MASS MEDIA ITSELF AND NOT CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. ADDRESS HOUSEHOLD FINANCIAL ISSUES OR INCREASED LEISURE TME SERVICE UNDERSCORES THE NEED TO INTEGRATE MEDIA SOCIAL MEDIA AND OTHER INTERVENTIONS HE PH CAN LEAD AND CHANGING THE PARADIGM OF WHAT EXERCISE LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BE AS SIMPLE AS YEAH I THINK IN YOUR LIVING ROOM RIGHT AFTER DINNER AND THIS WILL HELP. INCREASE NOT ONLY YOUR YOUR OVERALL WELLNESS. GERMAN HELP. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR TO SEE A DOCTOR EMILY GOOD THIS YOU- I'M HERE TO SUPPORT THE THIS PROPOSAL I THINK THE- GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW OF WHAT'S GOING ON WITH PHYSICAL ACTIVITY DURING COVERED NUMBER OF PEOPLE STUCK INSIDE THEIR HOMES ACTIVITIES GONE DOWN DRAMATICALLY- WHAT I PARTICULARLY LIKE- THERE TWO THINGS ONE IS- THAT THE FITNESS COUNCIL IS NOW LOOKING AT THIS BALANCE BETWEEN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND MENTAL HEALTH THOSE TWO THINGS GO TOGETHER REALLY WELL BUILT ON ALL CHILDREN THRIVE IN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. THAT IN PARTICULAR WHAT DO YOU AND OTHER SUPPORT IN DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM AND- WE KNOW THAT SOCIAL SUPPORT IS FUNDAMENTAL TO BEHAVIOR CHANGE AND THE THAT THAT THE DEPARTMENT WAS AS SUCCESSFUL AS THEY WERE USING A SOCIAL MARKETING CAMPAIGN TO PROMOTE DPP THIS SEEMS LIKE THE NATURAL NEXT STEP FOR THAT. AND SO OFTEN. PEOPLE LOOK AT DIABETES AND THINKING THINK OF IT AS A NUTRITION pPHYSICAL ACTIVITY SO I. YEARS AGO YOU TOLD ME A STORY I DON'T KNOW IF YOU MEMBER OF BEING IN THE ER AND SOMEBODY TOOK THEIR SHOE OFF AND WHAT COULD WHAT ELSE CAME OFF WITH THE ISSUE- THAT HAS STAYED WITH ME- PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES FUNDAMENTAL TO THE TO THE SOLUTION TO THAT I'D BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T THOUGH ALSO SAY- AND IT IT. BILLY NOT SOMETHING FOR THIS SUBCOMMITTEE- NATIONALLY 8% OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENTS IN THE COUNTRY DON'T HAVE A P. E. TEACHER IN CALIFORNIA IT'S 50% EVEN MORE EVEN FEWER LATINO AND AFRICAN AMERICAN KID SO IT IT IT'S A BOTH HAND BUT WE ARE WE IN CALIFORNIA IN DESPERATE NEED FOR MORE P. E. TEACHERS ESPECIALLY IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. OKAY THE ONLY QUESTION I HAVE THAN FOR THE PANEL IS WHETHER OR NOT- THIS PROPOSED PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN IS DUPLICATIVE OF SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING WITHIN ALL CHILDREN. THE ACES EXCUSE ME THE ACES AWARE CAMPAIGN WHICH IS ALSO PRIORITIZING PROMOTING HEALTHY LIFESTYLE CHOICES SUCH AS EXERCISE. IS IT DUPLICATIVE IS A SEPARATE HOUSING I THINK I'M HEARING YOU ON AND YEAH I MEAN I THINK THERE IS- I THINK THE ACES WORK IS MUCH BROADER THIS IS MUCH MORE SPECIFIC JUST TO THE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY SAIVA. DR THOMAS. DOCTOROW MOST. SO THERE BIG DIFFERENCE IS THAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO ENCOMPASS THE WHOLE- TRAJECTORY AND THE WHOLE SPECTRUM OF EVERYONE IN IN CALIFORNIA FROM CHILDREN TO GRANDPARENTS IN YOUR SAID ASSEMBLY ANSWER BACK THE DIFFERENCE BUT THE OTHER BIG THING IS LEVERAGING YES YOU HIGHLIGHTED VERY WELL THAT THERE'S A LOT OF ACTIVITIES THAT ARE OCCURRING BUT THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO NOW CONNECT THE DOTS AND REALLY LEVERAGE ALL OF THE FANTASTIC WORK THAT'S BEING DONE HERE IN CALIFORNIA A PROMOTED. WITH THE FERRY AT. YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN THAT ARE GOING TO BE THE TARGET AT SO IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEVERAGE THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE AND NOT FORGETTING CONTINENTAL THAT MENTAL HEALTH. EXACTLY AND YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH THE GOVERNOR'S COUNCIL ON PHYSICAL FTNESS FOR. TWENTY YEARS PROBABLY- I DON'T THINK THEY'VE EVER HAD THE RESOURCES TO REALLY DO SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT AND HERE'S A CHANCE TO DO THAT. SOUNDS GREAT WITH THAT I WILL THANK THIS PANEL AND WOULD ASK THAT WE NOW PLEASE PRESENT ON ISSUE FIFTEEN. SO THAT IS ME AGAIN ISSUE FIFTEEN- TAXES- PROPOSITION NINETY NINE AND FIFTY SIX ADJUSTMENT. THE GOVERNMENT OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REFLECT THE FOLLOWING ADJUSTMENTS TO PROPOSITION NINETY NINE AND FIFTY SIX THE FACT THAT TAX REVENUE YOUR LATEST FUNDING FOR CDPH CENTER FOR HEALTHY COMMUNITY PROGRAM. AND I BELIEVE THE FIRST ONE ITS PROPOSITION NINETY NINE RESEARCH ACCOUNT. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REFLECTS A DECREASE OF ONE POINT NINE MILLION IN PROPOSITION NINETY NINE RESEARCH ACCOUNT OPERATIONS. AS A RESULT OF UPDATED PROPOSITION NINETY NINE REVENUE PROJECTIONS. THE DECREASE COULD SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND EIGHT ADMINISTRATION AND ONE POINT TWO MILLION AND EXTERNAL CONTRACTS. THE REVENUES ARE USED FOR TOBACCO RELATED DISEASE RESEARCH WERE ASKED THE FIRST ONE IS. STAKEHOLDERS REPORTED FIFTY PAGE INTENDS TO REDUCE FUNDING FOR THE CALIFORNIA CANCER REGISTRY BY ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION DUE TO REDUCTION IN PROPOSITION NINETY NINE RAPID YOU IS THIS ACCURATE THE ANSWER IS YES. THE FOLLOWING QUESTION IS WHAT WILL BE THE IMPACT OF THE- CALIFORNIA CANCER REGISTRY OF THIS REDUCTION. AT THE IMPACT IS BASICALLY IN THREE AREAS THERE WILL BE DECREASED QUALITY OF DATA AND SUBSEQUENT LOSS OF FEDERAL FUNDING. BOB BY THE QUALITY WE NEED WE NEED THAT THE QUALITY WOULD BE IMPACTED BY THE DIMINISHED ABILITY TO CONFIRM CHAPTER CASES. THE MONEY IS BEING USED FOR AT THE LONGER WAIT TIMES FOR DATA AVAILABILITY FEDERAL FUNDS FOR REGIONAL STAKEHOLDERS. THAT USE THAT DATA COLLECTED WHICH WOULD BE THE DATA COLLECTION CONTRACTORS THAT RECEIVED THE INITIAL- CHAPTER REPORT. THEY WON'T HAVE THAT ABILITY TO HAVE THE MATCHING FUNDS AND THIS WOULD RESULT IN FURTHER DECREASES. AND DATA QUALITY. AND FINALLY THE ELIMINATION OF POP UP APPRECIATE THE BROCHURE. THE FAT OF FIGHT THEIR FACTORY REQUIREMENT OF HAVING POSITION INFORMED CANCER PATIENTS. THAT THEY MAY BE CONTACTED BY BY RESEARCHERS. SO CURRENTLY IF THE BROKE IS. RENTED BY THE PAGE BUT IT SIMPLE TO NOTE THAT THE PTO. OF THE BROCHURE WILL CONTINUE TO BE MADE AVAILABLE AND THE POSITION OF THE SITE HOW THEY WILL PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO THEIR PATIENTS. THANK YOU AYE- I THINK THE QUESTION AND I'M HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP OFFLINE I WANT TO ENSURE SIMILAR TO HOW WE HOW IT SUPPLEMENTATION LANGUAGE EARLIER THE NONE OF OUR TOBACCO TAXES ARE GOING TOWARD STAFFING OF- LET'S SAY SHERIFF'S AND FRESNO COUNTY. THAT INSTEAD THESE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FOR INTENTIONAL PROGRAMS AS IT STATES FOR EVIDENCE BASED HEALTH PROMOTION AND HEALTH COMMUNICATION ACTIVITIES- ARE WE CONFIDENT THAT THERE ARE NO RESOURCES GOING TOWARDS- SHERIFF'S IN PARTICULAR COUNTIES HOW DO WE HAVE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY- OR HOW ARE WE- FOLLOWING UP ON THE- SO THAT IS. NOT FOR US TO BE THAT. ABLE ON BACK AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THOUGH WHAT WHAT I CAN ASSURE YOU IS THAT WE ARE USING THE FUNDS. TO OBTAIN THE DATA THAT WILL DRIVE ACTION WELL IN TERMS OF CANCER RESEARCH HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO I CAN TELL YOU THAT THAT'S WHAT WE ARE DOING AND OUR OUR CONTRACTORS. ARE ARE GREAT PARTNERS AND ARE HELPING US GET BACK EITHER SORRY I WANT TO MAKE SURE OF IS TALKING ABOUT TOBACCO TAXES WITH THAT COMMENT ABOUT ON SATIN TATIAN VERSES- THE CANCER REGISTRY- JUST TO ENSURE THAT. THEY WERE. THANK YOU START. IS IT THE SAME RESPONSE OR IS THERE A DIFFERENT RESPONSE FOR TOBACCO TAXES. I CAN'T I CAN'T GIVE YOU THAT PERFECT- RESPONSE SO I WOULD HAVE TO GET BACK. TO YOU ON. I WOULD LOVE TO FOLLOW UP AS I ARE. NOT JERRY SILICON VALLEY WAS OUR INNER. RECTOR HELLO MISTER CHAIR MY NAME IS TERRY SILICON VALLEY DAHLMAN AND I'M ON THE LIST TO HELP OUT HERE IF NEEDED I'M AND ACTING DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR CENTER FOR HEALTHY COMMUNITIES. AND I CAN SAY FOR THE FUNDING THAT WE RECEIVE- FROM THE TOBACCO TAX IN OUR PROGRAMS- WE HAVE- SEVERAL EVALUATION TOOLS IN WHICH- WE ENSURE THAT THE FUNDS ARE USED FOR THE STATED PURPOSE SO. WITHIN OUR TOBACCO CONTROL PROGRAM WE ARE PROVIDING. FUNDING TO WHAT WE CALL LOCAL THE AGENCIES WHICH WOULD BE OUR- COUNTY PARTNERS- THE FUNDS WOULD BE PROVIDED IT FOR THE SPECIFIC USE AND SO WE WOULD BE ENSURING THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO YOU KNOW LAW ENFORCEMENT OR- OR OTHER AREAS IN THE COUNTY. BROUGH OUR GRANTS AND THE ASSESSMENT OF OUR GRANT AN EVALUATION OF OUR GRANTS THAT WE DO HAVE SOME PROCESS HE'S SET UP TO ENSURE THAT THE FUNDS ARE BEING USED FOR THEIR INTENDED PURPOSE. I LOOK FORWARD TO FOLLOWING UP AND SHOWING YOU SOME EXAMPLES OF COUNTIES WHO MIGHT NOT BE ACTING IN THE BEST INTERESTS OR UNDER THE INTENT. OF ENSURING THAT WERE PROMOTING PUBLIC HEALTH AND- INSTEAD SEEMS TO BE- SUPPLANTING OTHER FUNDING AND- AM CONCERNED THAT WE ARE NOT ADDRESSING HEAD ON- THE ISSUE THAT THESE FUNDS WERE INTENDED FOR AND SO. I AM ANXIOUS TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THAT FOLLOW. UP TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. ABSOLUTELY WERE DEFINITELY TO UP WITH YOU ON THAT. WITH THAT I WILL THANK VERY MUCH PANEL SIX WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO PANEL SEVEN WHICH WILL PRESENT FIVE PROPOSALS. FOR ESTIMATES FOR THE CENTER FOR FAMILY HEALTH WE WILL HAVE FOUR PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL INCLUDING THREE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND ONE REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA CLINICAL LABORATORY ASSOCIATION WHO WILL COMMENT ON ISSUE NINETEEN THE GENETIC DISEASE SCREENING PROGRAM ESTIMATE. WE WILL HOLD ALL QUESTIONS UNTIL THE END LET US PLEASE BEGIN WITH THE GENETIC DISEASE TESTING PROGRAM ESTIMATES. WHEN YOU'RE READY. AFTERNOON MY NAME IS RICHARD ONLINE I'M A DIVISION CHIEF FOR THE GENERIC THAT THE SCREENING PROGRAM THE GST. AND I'M HAPPY TO FIRST- PRESENT AN OVERVIEW OF OUR ESTIMATE. YES PLEASE BUDGET OUT OF THE PEN OR THE ACTIVITIES OF TWO MAJOR PROGRAM- THE GENETIC TO DETECT IN FINER TO THE T. THE WARRANTS AND PRINTING SCREENING ALSO KNOWN AS MBS AND PIANO. OUR ESTIMATES OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY A DOWNWARD TRENDS AND LYFT BIRTH. TRANSLOCATE BOTH THEN BE A PIANO SIX SPEND THE TRUTH AND REVENUE SO I'M TALKING ABOUT THEM TOGETHER. YEAH NO SIMPLE ADDITION RATES OF MEMBERS OF ALSO DECREASED. SCREENING TREND AWAY FROM BIOCHEMICAL SCREENING THAN ANYA AND TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE BECAUSE- OF IMPLEMENTATION PENANG BRINGING. WHICH WAS FUNDED IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AFTER BIRTH YEAH NABC WITH THE- BUT THEY HAVE TO DENY IS ALSO KNOWN A- A NON INVASIVE PRENATAL SCREENING OR AN IP HE- HAVE A MUCH BETTER DETECTION RATE AND ACTORS TO GIVE THEM THE CURRENT BOTH LOCAL SCREENING PROGRAM. AND THAT'S THE CURRENT STANDARD OF CARE FOR I MEAN FOR DOWN SYNDROME AND TRICYCLE WITH EIGHTEEN AND THIRTY. DECEMBER THIRD THE FINANCE PROGRAM OF THE VOLUNTARY STATEWIDE PROGRAM MANDATED BY STATUTE- THAT MANDATES THAT WOULD MEAN ACCORDING TO THE STANDARDS SET BY ORGANIZATION ASK MARKET BASED APPROACH CURTAIN CALL'S OF OBSTETRICIAN GYNECOLOGISTS. AND IT'S FOCUSED ON MAKING A UNIFORM EQUITABLE SCREENING AVAILABLE FOR THE ENTIRE POPULATION. AND VERY IMPORTANTLY INCLUDES- FOLLOW UP ON FOR THE DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES AS PART OF OUR COMPREHENSIVE FIFTY. SO FAR EXPENDITURES THAT THE CURRENT- FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THE ESTIMATE AS LITTLE CHANGE OVERALL PERSON THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT. HOWEVER FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE THE AMERICAN FLAG THE FINANCIAL INCREASE OF UP TO TWENTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS. FOR A TOTAL OF A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION AND EXPENDITURES. ALMOST ALL THESE ARE TO DO INCREASE OF- HELPFUL SYSTEM. WITHOUT LIMITATION OF THE AFGHAN AND SCREENING. AS WELL AS THE MAJOR SYSTEM REDESIGN OF THE TENNIS PROGRAM. AND ARE IN. SYSTEM MIGRATION COSTS FOR A NEW CLOUD PLATFORM THE POPE AND THE S. AND P. ENOUGH. WHICH WAS REQUIRED BY THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY. ON THE REVENUE SIDE ARE HOPING THAT FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO TOTAL A HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION. WHICH IS A DECREASE OF ELEVEN POINT NINE MILLION COMPARED TO THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT. THAT DECREASE IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE DECLINE IN THE BIRTHRATE THAT THEY MENTIONED EARLIER. THIS DECLINE IN REVENUE TO THE POTENTIAL NEGATIVE EFFECT ARE PROTECTED ON COMMISSION. WITHOUT ANY FEE CHANGES SO- THROUGH THE RULE MAKING PROCESS IT IS S. P. WALL PROPOSED INCREASE- TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN DOLLARS IT'S PAST TIME FOR THE NEWBORN SCREENING AND WE ARE ALSO PROPOSING CRITICS OF THE- THREE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY TWO DOLLARS FOR SELF IN A SCREENING. IN A FIVE DOLLARS PER NEURAL TUBE DEFECT SCREENING THEM ON THE PIANO OUTSIDE BEGINNING JULY TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND IF YOU CHANGES ARE NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE LOSS OF REVENUE TO CRITICALLY. THE GREAT THE PLAN LIVE BIRTH. AND IMPLEMENTATION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CLOUD MIGRATION SYSTEM REDESIGN THAT I MENTIONED. THE FOLLOWING EXPENDITURES RELATED TO HIGHER CONTRACT RATES UP SUPPORT FOR SCREENING. WHAT THE SPEED CHANGES AND RESTRUCTURING WE PROJECT REVENUES FOR TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE WILL TOTAL A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION WHICH IS. AN INCREASE OF THIRTY SIX MILLION OVER THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE ATTACK AND WILL BE- I PUT IN MORE THAN. IT EXPENDITURES. THAT'S THE FOR MY ESTIMATE OVERVIEW- WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO ADDRESS THE LABORATORY CONCERNS OUR- I WOULD LIKE YOU TO ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS ON THE AGENDA IF WE CAN ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU OKAY. RIGHT THERE CONCERNS ON THE AGENDA SENTIFI THE LABORATORIES RELATED TO PRENATAL SCREENING- THE FIRST WORD- THE FIRST BORDERS PARTICULARLY ASIAN BUT PROHIBITING ALLOWED FROM PARTICIPATING- SO IN A MEETING. AND TO CLARIFY THE FITNESS PROGRAM IS MORE THAN THAT HAVE WELCOME AND WE HAVE TO ACTUALLY CANNOT PERFORM. BUT ANYWAY WITH OTHER PROVIDERS REPORTER. BUT HIS BACKGROUND HE PAGE MANDATED TO APPROVE. WELL AS WELL AS FROM THE PROGRAM TO ENSURE EQUITY OF ACCESS AND UTILIZATION. WHAT THE POPULATION HIGH QUALITY STANDARDS FOR SCREENING AND FOLLOW UPS OF. NOT STARTS WITH THE SPACE BETWEEN EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS THAT INCLUDE ENTRANCE BETWEEN THE INSURANCE. AND ALTHOUGH FUND SUBSEQUENT REFERRALS FOR FOLLOW UP SERVICES SUCH AS AN ACCOMPLICE. REPUBLICAN OFFICIALS UNDERSTAND HER OPTIONS FOR DIAGNOSTIC. HE SAID. DECEPTION IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES CALIFORNIA LAW AND REGULATIONS THAT PROHIBITED- FOR THE DEFENDING REPERTORY. OFFERING THE TESTING THAT THE DENNIS. PROGRAM OFFERED THE NEW OF A THAT ALL PEOPLE ARE PROVIDED WITH THE BEST MOST BECAUSE- AND COMPETENT THE SCREEN. WITHOUT REGARD TO OUR REYES BUT FOR SOME OF THE OR OTHER K. ALL POLL THE- REASON FOR THE LEGISLATURE. TO CREATE THE THING WIDE ENOUGH FOR MORE THAN FIVE AGO. AND SCREAM OUT OF THE ALL THE OF NEED TO BE RUN WITH PRINCIPLE. PEOPLE THAT THE RETURN THE TOWN'S PARK WITHIN THREE SCREEN PANEL PROTEST. ENERGIZED STATEWIDE. PROGRAM WILL REDUCE EQUITABLE. OF SCREENING FOLLOW UP SERVICES. AND COMPROMISED THE STATE'S ABILITY TO MONITOR POPULATIONS HEALTH. PUTTING ON TO THE SECOND BULLET THE LABORATORY CONCERNS AND- THE- ABOUT- MANDATING THAT ALL HAVE WORK ON BE IN WITHIN CALIFORNIA- WE OBSERVE PIANOS PROGRAM WERE APPROACHED BY SEVERAL LABORATORIES OPERATING CONDUCTED. YES NAY SERVICES WITHIN CALIFORNIA SO THERE WAS NO INDICATION. PROCUREMENTS OR LAPTOP READING OUTSIDE OF THE STATE. BEYOND A CLEAR NEED TO SUPPORT- IF IN A IN THE THROUGH THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENTS REMAIN WITHIN THE STATE. THERE'S ALSO A RISK BOB THAT SUPPOSED JUSTICE SHIPPING. AS WELL AS POTENTIALLY INCREASE TURNAROUND TIMES IMPROPER. I'M FOR STATE CONTRACTING ROLES ARE ARE THAT WOULD BE CONTRACT THE LOWEST COST POSSIBLE PROVIDE SUCH SERVICES. MELENDEZ CONCERN WAS NOW IT IS SHOWING FOR INSTANCE I THINK IT'S STAKEHOLDERS. I'M FIT AND REALITIES IN H. ACTUALLY CONDUCTED OUR FIRST. YOU HAVE RELATED STAKEHOLDER MEETING IN TWENTY NINETEEN. WHICH INCLUDED REPRESENTATIVES FROM LABORATORIES ACON ANOTHER THAN THE PRENATAL BIOETHICS COMMUNITY- WERE INVITED AND PARTICIPATED IN A DISCUSSION ABOUT PLANS. IN LABORATORY. THEN IN. TWENTY NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE PH SURVEY THAT THE CANNELLA ALLOWED HIM TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THE PIANOS PROGRAM WE'VE GOT A SERIES OF MEETINGS WITH. THE FIFTIES AND A LAMP. WE CAN CONTINUE TO MEET REGULARLY WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS. RESPONDED TO QUESTIONS FROM FAMILY MEMBERS AND OTHERS. FINALLY WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH A CALIFORNIA PROGRESS UNDER THE BALLOT I'M GOING TO ELECTRIFY THE COMMUNICATIONS- EXISTENCE AND THAT'S PROVIDERS AND OTHER LIGHT. CONTROL. WE HAVE A DETAILED QUESTION. NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM CHRISTY FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF LABORATORY ASSOCIATION PLEASE BE IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH A MISTER CHAIRMAN MY NAME IS CHRISTY POINT I'M HERE AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA CLINICAL LABORATORY ASSOCIATION OUR ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN HEARING CALIFORNIA FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS WE HAVE AS MEMBERS HOSPITAL BASED LABS LARGE COMMERCIAL LABS THAT COVER THE UNITED STATES. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PUBLIC CLOUDS IN SMALL INDEPENDENT SPECIALTY LABS I'M HERE TODAY TO SPEAK ABOUT THE PRENATAL SCREENING PROGRAM AND WE DO HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS WITH THE DEPARTMENT'S RECENT PROPOSED CHANGES TO HOW THE FETAL CHROMOSOME AVENEL ABNORMALITIES WILL BE SCREENED. THESE CHANGES WILL NEGATIVELY IMPACT ACCESS TO TESTING FOR PREGNANT WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA. EFFECTIVE JULY ONE OF THIS YEAR THE PRENATAL SCREENING PROGRAM IS REPLACING ITS CURRENT TESTING WITH THE ADVANCED CELL FREE DNA BLOOD TESTING. THE DEPARTMENT DOES STATE THAT PARTICIPATION IN THE STATE SCREENING PROGRAM IS VOLUNTARY FOR PREGNANT WOMEN HOWEVER AFTER JULY FIRST PREGNANT WOMEN WILL NO LONGER HAVE ACCESS TO THIS MORE ADVANCED TESTING OUTSIDE OF THE PROGRAM. THE DEPARTMENT HAS DECLARED THAT IT WILL BE ILLEGAL FOR PREGNANT WOMEN TO GET THIS TESTING DONE AT A LABORATORY OUTSIDE. SO EVEN THOUGH IT IS TECHNICALLY VOLUNTARY. A PREGNANT WOMAN DOES NOT HAVE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM BUT IF THEY DON'T THEY CANNOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE CELL FREE DNA TESTING. I DO UNDERSTAND- THAT THEY HAVE SAID THAT IN THE PAST. THERE HAVE BEEN LIMITS ON THE TYPE OF TESTING THAT WAS OFFERED THROUGH THE PEANUTS PROGRAM HOWEVER THIS NEW TESTING IS A CURRENT KIND OF FAR BETTER APPROACH TO TESTING. AND WE DO THINK IT'S UNFAIR TO LIMIT THAT OUTSIDE OF THE PROGRAM. A PREGNANT WOMEN SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE WHERE SHE HAS HER TESTING DONE FOR THIS NEW TYPE OF PROCEDURE. AND THE OTHER ISSUE IS THAT WE ARE CONCERNED THAT LABORATORIES ARE BEING PROHIBITED NOW IN THIS WAY. CALIFORNIA LABORATORIES HAVE BEEN PROVIDING THIS TYPE OF CELL FREE DNA TESTING FOR MANY YEARS AND HAVE PERFORMED MILLIONS OF THESE TESTS. THESE LABORATORIES HOLD VALID LICENCES ISSUED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ACCREDITATION BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT UNDER THE CALIFORNIA I'M SORRY UNDER THE CLINICAL LABORATORY IMPROVEMENT AMENDMENTS OR CLEA. AND ACCREDITATION BY THE COLLEGE OF AMERICAN PATHOLOGISTS TO PERFORM CELL FREE DNA TESTING. AND IN FACT THE LABORATORIES HAVE BEEN OPERATING UNDER THESE LICENSES AND ACCREDITATIONS TO BE PERFORMING TESTING AND FOLLOW UP TEST FOR THE DEPARTMENT'S CURRENT PROGRAM CURRENT PRENATAL SCREENING PROGRAM. THIS NEW PROHIBITIN WILL RESTRICT OF THOSE SAME LABORATORIES HAVE BEEN PERFORMING THESE TESTS IN THE PAST. FROM BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO THESE TESTS OUTSIDE OF THE NEW PROGRAM ONCE THE TRANSITION TAKES PLACE. ANOTHER CONCERN WITH THE PROPOSED TRANSITION IS THAT LABORATORIES HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY DO WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. THEY WOULD HAVE TO GUARANTEE THAT ALL THE TESTING WOULD BE DONE ONLY AT ONE OF THEIR LABORATORIES PHYSICALLY LOCATED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I'VE BEEN IN I KNOW THERE WAS MENTIONED THAT THERE WAS- LABORATORIES WERE GIVEN THE OPTION. BUT WE DO KNOW OF SOME LABORATORIES THAT DID WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM AND WE'RE TOLD THAT THEY COULD NOT. BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE TESTING WOULD BE DONE IN CALIFORNIA OUT THERE CALIFORNIA SITE. AND THE REASON THIS IS A CONCERN IS BECAUSE- A LOT OF CALIFORNIA LABORATORIES HAVE SPECIALTY LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. AND THEY HAVE SPECIFIC TRAINING AND PERSONNEL FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF TESTS. BY CONSOLIDATING THE SPECIALTY TESTING AT SOME OFTHEIR KEY LOCATIONS. THE PATIENTS REALLY DO GET THE BEST IN CLASS SERVICE AT THAT LOCATION. THERE IS NO BENEFIT TO THE PATIENT FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO RESTRICT WHERE THE TEST IS PHYSICALLY PROCESS. THERE WAS MENTION THAT THERE WAS CONCERN THAT THERE BE LOST SPECIMENS. OR INCREASE THE TURN AROUND TIME BUT REALLY- WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SHOW THAT THE LABORATORY INDUSTRY. HAS REALLY DONE A GOOD JOB- IN REGARD TO ALL OF THE TRANSACTIONS AND- THERE ARE VERY FEW SPECIMENS THAT ARE LOST. IN THE TURN AROUND TIME IS REALLY IMPROVED I MEAN AS YOU KNOW WHEN YOU ORDER SOMETHING ON. AMAZON YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH GET IT THE NEXT DAY EVEN IF IT'S ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND ALL OF THOSE LOGISTICS THAT LABORATORIES HAVE DEVELOPED SPECIALLY DURING COVERT- TO EXPAND CAPACITY THEY REALLY. HAVE GOTTEN IT DOWN ON BEING ABLE TO PROCESS THESE SAMPLES OUTSIDE OF THE STATE. AND THEN THERE ARE ALSO SOME ADDITIONAL CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSED TRANSITION BUT WE WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THE MOST IMPORTANT ONES DURING THE LIMITED TIME WE HAVE TODAY. BUT THESE OTHER ISSUES DO NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BEFORE THIS PROGRAM TRANSITION TAKES PLACE. I AM I KNOW THERE'S BEEN MENTION OF SOME MEETINGS IN TWENTY NINETEEN BUT REALLY THOSE WERE A LOT MORE LIMITED AND THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF CHANGES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE SINCE THEN A LOT MORE INFORMATION THAT HAS COME OUT. AND SO REALLY- THE ISSUE IS THAT THERE'S NOT BEEN ENOUGH PUBLIC A COMMENTER PUBLIC INPUT. OF PHYSICIANS WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAM. AND THE PATIENTS WHO MATERNAL FETAL KERR IS DICTATED BY THESE TESTS. HAVE NOT REALLY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD. OTHERS BEEN SPECIFIC GROUPS INVITED TO THESE MEETINGS BUT IT'S NOT BEEN AN OPEN PUBLIC PROCESS. SO WE'RE ASKING FOR A PUBLIC HEARING TO BE HELD TO ADDRESS THE MANY PUBLIC POLICY CONCERNS. IN REGARD TO THE TRANSITION OF THIS PROGRAM. AND I REALLY DO THINK IF WE WORK TOGETHER WE CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE IMPORTANT UPDATE. WHILE ALSO PROTECTING PATIENT ACCESS TO THIS NEW TESTING. WE URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO CAREFULLY REVIEW THE PROPOSAL. AND MAKE ANY AMENDMENTS TO PROTECT PUBLIC ACCESS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR GIVING THE TIME TO SPEAK ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSU AND I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU I'M GOING TO BEGIN WITH MR ONLY I WAS HOPING YOU COULD COMMENT AND RESPONSE- SPECIFICALLY HOW IS IT DIFFERENT THAN NOW. WHAT HAS OCCURRED- ARE ARE WE LIMITING CHOICES- TO THOSE WHO ARE PARTICIPATING IN OUR PROGRAM TODAY BEFORE THIS PROPOSAL OR- IS THAT CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE STATE'S DONE IN THE PAST. WELL AS I MENTIONED I'M NOT FOR THE PAST THIRTY FIVE YEARS. ALL OF PRENATAL SCREENING HAS BEEN DONE THROUGH THE STATE PROGRAM. IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES THE INCEPTION OF THE PROGRAM AND THEN DEVELOP THAT'S THE WAY LAWS REGULATIONS. THAT WOULD HAVE MANDATED SCREENING DONE. AND HAVE READING- CHANGED OVER THE YEARS- ANALYTES HAVE BEEN ADDED OTHER CHANGES HAVE OCCURRED WITH PRENATAL SCREENING THE PROGRAM HAS ADAPTED THOSE CHANGES. AND WE SEE THE ADOPTION OF THE DNA OF. THE ANOTHER CHANGE IN TECHNOLOGY THAT'S BECAUSE WE'VE DONE OVER THE YEARS- THAT WOULD YOU WOULD- KERRY OUT AS AMENDED AS A STATE WIDE- BROWN THE- BUT STILL VOLUNTARY BUT- THE WE ARE. OBLIGATED TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE LAST FORMING THE SCREENING ARE DOING SO IN THE END- TO CONFORM FASHION SO THAT THERE IS EQUITY IN THEM THE WAY IT PROVIDED AS TO WHETHER THERE WOULD BE CHOICE- THERE WILL BE MULTIPLE LAYOUTS CONTRACTED FROM SCREENING INFO- THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF- CHOICES FOR- UP TO TWO. SCREENING FOR TRISOMY. TWENTY ONE THIRTEEN. COULD I MAY FOLLOW UP THEN IF I CAN- EARLIER YOU SAID IT WAS BEST IN CLASS SERVICE AND THAT THERE WAS NO BENEFITS TO THE PATIENT FOR THE- POLICY THAT'S BEING PROMOTED HERE- I'M I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE BENEFIT FOR THIS. DATE TO EMPLOYING. PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF OUR STATE WITH PUBLIC DOLLARS AND I'M HOPING YOU CAN COMMENT ON. WHERE THE BENEFIT FOR US IS A SYSTEM TO SENDING THOSE RESOURCES OUT OF STATE. YEAH EFFORTS TO CIVICALLY FOR THAT OUT OF STATE PROCESS- AND THAT REALLY IS JUST. BECAUSE OUR LABORATORIES- HAVE MULTIPLE LOCATON SO THEY'LL HAVE A PHYSICAL LOCATION HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WHERE THEY DO SOME OF THE TESTING BUT IT HAS TO DO WITH THE COMPLEXITY OF THE TESTING THEY MIGHT HAVE MAYBE A MODERATE COMPLEXITY TESTING LABORATORY HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT THEN THEY HAVE A HIGH COMPLEXITY TESTING LOCATED SOMEWHERE ELSE MAYBE IN UTAH OR NEVADA. AND IT MAY JUST BE FOR PERSONAL REASONS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND SO REALLY IT'S JUST THE PRESIDENT OF THE STATE TELLING LABORATORIES WHERE WHICH TYPE OF TESTING CAN BE DONE AT EACH OTHER FACILITIES THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT. BECAUSE WE DO THINK THAT IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAT THE TESTING IS DONE. YOU KNOW AT A THE FACILITY THAT HAD THE PROPER OBVIOUSLY PERSONNEL IN- THE PROPER RESOURCES. AND IT JUST LIMITS THE OPTIONS FOR THE STATE AND SO IF THE STATE. WANTS TO HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT LABORATORIES THAT CAN PERFORM THIS TESTING WE JUST THINK IT'S LIMITING TO TELL THOSE LABORATORIES. THIS SPECIFIC YOU KNOW ANY PARTICULAR TYPE OF TEST HAS TO BE DONE ONLY GOT ONE OF YOUR FACILITIES THAT'S LOCATED IN STATE. MARYLAND I'LL TURN THE QUESTION AS WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE THE CAPACITY WITH THE- LABORATORIES WHO WOULD DO THIS AND STATE TO DEAL WITH THE VOLUME OF TESTING THAT'S REQUIRED HOPING- YOU CAN COMMENT ON THAT MISTRAL. YES CERTAINLY- THE LABORATORIES THAT HAVE APPLIED TO CONTRACT WITH THE STATE- HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO ALL OF THE THIRTY SECOND ST- ELLSWORTH REQUIRE WITH OUR INITIAL- REQUIRED OF THEM SO- WE BELIEVE THAT. THERE ARE SEVERAL LABORATORIES IN THE LABORATORIES THAT ARE CAPABLE AND HAVE THE CAPACITY TO. ALL THE. BUT A TEACHER. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONTINUED- COMMENTARY AND- THE INFORMATION ON THIS BUT WITH THAT I WILL THANKS VERY MUCH THIS PANEL WE WILL NOW PRESENT ON ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY. THANK YOU. I THINK SELDOM FROM DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WHAT DIVISION IN THE WAKE NOVEMBER ESTIMATE THERE IS NO GENERAL FUND INCLUDED FEATHER WITH PROGRAMS WELL WE HAVE ENOUGH FEDERAL FUNDS TO COVER FOOD LOCAL SERVICES. AND STATE OPERATIONS EXPENDITURES. AFTER MY BRIEF THE SPIDEY IN FOOD EXPENDITURES FOR THE CURRENT YEAR AS A RESULT OF TWO KEY FACTORS. FIRST AFTER THE SLIGHT DECREASE IN PROJECTED PARTICIPATION UP TO THE IN THE CURRENT YEAR TO NINE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX THOUSAND PARTICIPANTS EACH ONE. OF THAT IS A SLIGHT DECREASE FROM NINE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PARTICIPANTS LAST YEAR THAT WE ARE STILL MUCH HIGHER THAN PRE PANDEMIC LEVEL OF ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND BUDGET SPENDS EACH MONTH. THE SECOND FACTOR IS THE COSTS PER PARTICIPANT. THERE WAS A SLIGHT DECREASE AND ACTUAL COST PER PARTICIPANT. IN THE PRIOR YEAR WHICH IMPACTS OUR EXPENDITURE PROJECTIONS FOR CURRENT AND BUDGET YEAR. THE DECREASE IN THE CURRENT YEAR IS OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN BRITAIN BATCH VEGETABLE BENEFITS WHICH BEGAN IN JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND CONTINUE THROUGH THE END OF THIS MONTH AS PART OF FEDERAL CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS. THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE INCREASE WAS INCLUDED IN THE RECENTLY SIGNED FEDERAL BUDGET SO IT WILL NOW CONTINUE THROUGH SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND THEREFORE WE WILL MAKE THAT UPDATE IN THE MAY BE BEST. THANK YOU. ANY QUESTIONS THE NOVEMBER ASPECTS. I'M I ONLY HAVE ONE SO FIRST OFF VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION FOR CONTINUING THAT UNTIL SEPTEMBER THAT WILL GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS ADDRESSING FOOD INSECURITY ON PAGE- SEVENTY. FIVE OF THE AGENDA TALKS ABOUT FOOD EXPENDITURE ESTIMATE AND ON IT IT SAID THAT THERE WAS A DECREASE. IN COSTS DUE TO A DECREASE IN FOOD INFLATION AND THAT FLIES IN THE FACE OF WHAT MANY OF US ARE. FEELING AND AWARE ABOUT REGARDING CONSUMER PRICES OVERALL THE FOOD BEING INCLUDED IN IT BUT I WAS HOPING YOU COULD ELABORATE ON WHETHER OR NOT WE NEED IS THERE AN OUTDATED- HOW IS IT NOT REFLECTING THE RECENT SIGNIFICANT INFLATION IN FOOD PRICES THAT MANY OF US ARE FEELING. SEVEN NOVEMBER ESTIMATE WAS CALCULATED. PROBABLY FINALIZE IN ABOUT SEPTEMBER AND THEN THERE'S NOT NECESSARILY A DECREASE IN THE INFLATION BUT A SMALLER RATE OF INFLATION THAT WHAT WE HAD PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED AND SO ANY CHANGE IN SOMETHING CENTS SEPTEMBER AND AN INFLATION RATE SINCE THEN WILL BE ADDRESSED THEY COULDN'T NAY REVISION. I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT I JUST WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF IT WAS OUTDATED AND SO- WITH THAT I WILL THANK YOU AND WE WILL NOW PRESENT ON ISSUE. TWENTY ONE. I HAVE AS WELL- THE ECG OF REQUESTS A THIRTY FOR TWENTY FIVE PERMANENT POSITIONS TO CONTINUE SUPPORT OF WHICH NEARLY IMPLEMENTED ELECTS AND SYSTEMS STATE GENERAL FUNDS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED THESE POSITIONS WILL BE FUNDED BY THE EXISTING FEDERAL WAY GRANTS.

FIFTEEN THE COMMITTEE DID ASK FOR AN UPDATE ON THE STATUS- OF CCGS COMPLAINT WORKLOAD- TO THE CURRENT UPDATE ADDS A QUARTER ONE OF FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. 61% OF LONG TERM CARE COMPLAINTS ARE BEING COMPLETED WITHIN THE SIXTY DAY STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS. I'LL ADD THAT OVER 96% AND IMMEDIATE JEOPARDY CAME THIRD HAVE BEEN INITIATED TIMELY. AND PRIOR TO THE ONSET OF COKE MIGHT COME IN COMPLAINTS WERE BEING COMPLETED TIMELY. AT THE DIRECTION OF STATE AND FEDERAL GUIDANCE. FROM THE NINETEEN IT SAYS THAT YOU DID A CHANGE OF FOCUS TO INFECTION PREVENTION AND IMMEDIATE JEOPARDY CASES WHICH RESULTED IN COMPLAINTS OF LOWER RISK TO BE TEMPORARILY DELAYED. SINCE THE LIFTING UP THAT DIRECTION THE H. TWO Q. HAS THREE OF THEM THAT COMMITMENT TO RESOLVING H. COMPLAINT. PAGE SICK YOU HAD MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE COMPLAINT AND FACILITY REPORTED INCIDENT BACKLOG. BY DEVELOPING LEAN PROCESS MAPS THAT BUNDLE INVESTIGATION AND STREAMLINED AND KICK STREAMLINED EFFORT TO CLOSE ORDER INTAKE. SINCE APRIL ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE CCQ HAS RESOLVED 70% OF THE COMPLAINT BACKLOG THAT EXISTED AT THAT TIME EXCLUDING MEDICAL INFORMATION BREACHES. STATE THANK YOU PLAN TO MAINTAIN AND BUILD UPON THE SUCCESS WE HAVE ACHIEVED SO FAR AND REMAINS FOCUSED ON RESOLVING AND REMAIN THE REMAINING COMPLAINT AND FACILITY REPORTED AND THAT BACKLOG. I'D LIKE TO PAUSE FOR A MOMENT- TASK FOR ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I'M I'M LOOKING AT PAGE ONE OH FOUR OF THE AGENDA AND GIVEN ALL THAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM THE PANDEMIC REGARDING INFECTIOUS DISEASE IN NURSING HOMES ARE TWO POSITIONS AND FOUR MILLION DOLLARS ANYWHERE NEAR ENOUGH. RESOURCES TO TRULY MAKE THE TWELVE HUNDRED NURSING HOMES WE HAVE AND CALIFORNIA SAFE. SO I WILL SHARE THAT- FROM THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC WE DID RECOGNIZE THAT THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR INFECTION CONTROL AND INTERVENTION AND EDUCATION BEYOND THE ACUTE CARE SETTING. AND REALLY REACHING INTO LONG TERM CARE SETTING IN KHAGARIA SETTING- THROUGHOUT THE LAST FEW YEARS- IN ADDITION TO OUR HEALTH CARE ASSOCIATED INFECTIONS PROGRAMS THAT- DID PROVIDE A LOT OF THAT EDUCATION WE DID- TEMPORARILY REDIRECT- SOME OF OUR- FACILITY SURVEYORS. DURING THE SUSPENSION OF OUR REGULARS SURVEY WORKLOAD TO AUGMENT THAT THE HEALTH CARE SAID THAT INSPECTION TEAM AND BECOME THE END SECTION PREVENTION SPECIALIST THAT ALSO PROVIDED EDUCATION TO OUR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES SO. BETWEEN THE TIME THE TEAM THAT WE ALREADY HAD- AND THE ADDITIONAL THIRTY TO THIRTY FIVE- SURVEYORS THAT WE BUILT THE EXPERTISE WITH OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS WE'VE MADE SIGNIFICANT. IMPROVEMENTS AND PROGRESS IN EDUCATING THE LONG TERM CARE PROVIDERS AND WE'RE ACTUALLY ABLE TO PROVIDE CONSULTATION TO- SIBLING DEPARTMENT- AND THOSE FACILITIES THAT ARE REGULATED BY THE- ENTITIES- LIKE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES ANOTHER DEPARTMENT SO I THINK THAT- GOING IN A. LONGER TERM INTO THE FUTURE- WILL BE YOU KNOW LOOKING AT WAYS TO MORE EFFICIENT TO LIVE AND- INFECTION CONTROL- MITIGATION MEASURES- WE'VE ALSO ROLLED OUT- PLAN ONLINE TRAINING PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES FOR FREE EDUCATIONAL TRAINING. FOR CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANT AT WORK IN LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES- AND THAT HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING THE EDUCATION AND THE TOWARD THE UP TO THE PEOPLE THAT NEED TO BE EXERCISING AND FOLLOWING THOSE PROTOCOLS. I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT CONVERSATION I BELIEVE DOCTOR WOULD AND I BOTH SHARE AN INTEREST IN ENSURING THAT WE ARE. PROTECTING OUR VULNERABLE RESIDENTS THAT ARE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND WOULD WANT TO ENGAGE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO APPROPRIATELY RIGHT SIZE THIS PROPOSAL SO THAT WE ALL HAVE THAT CONFIDENCE NECESSARY. THAT WE'RE DOING ALL WE CAN FOR- OUR ELDERS WHO ARE AND SNAPS UP. WITH THAT I WILL THANK YOU AND ASK YOU TO PLEASE PRESENT ON ISSUE THIRTY FIVE. ONE OF THE IMPORTANT ISSUE THIRTY FIVE- ADDRESSES THAT THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY CONTRACT- DPH IS REQUESTING EXPENDITURE OF FORTY- FROM THE LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAM FIND. AT EIGHTEEN POINT FOUR MILLION ANNUALLY- TO EXTEND AND AUGMENT THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE FACILITY CERTIFICATION CONTRACT WITH R. L. A. COUNTY PARTNERS. IN PUBLIC HEALTH- TO ACCOUNT FOR UPDATED INDIRECT COSTS AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT RATE PERSONNEL COSTS AT LEAST. IT'S EXTENSION WILL ALLOW TIME FOR L. A. COUNTY BETWEEN LOS ANGELES TO READ THEM- CONDUCTING LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION SERVICE MUCH LIKE THE H. TWO Q. WILL BE DOING. AND ALLOW THE PH TO STRUCTURE THE NEXT THREE YEAR CONTRACT ON MEASURABLE PERFORMANCE METRICS PANDEMIC. THIS IS A ONE YEAR EXTENSION- FOR US TO ALLOW OPPORTUNITY FOR L. A. COUNTY TO RE ENGAGE- INDOS MEASURABLE AND PERFORMANCE METRICS AND THEN TAKE THOSE FORWARD. INTO THE NEXT THREE YEAR CONTRACT. I'M GONNA DO AGAIN A LITTLE ON THIS IS IN A- FOR THE LATENESS OF THE HOUR CAN YOU PLEASE COMPARE HOW LA COUNTY'S PROGRAM. COMPARES TO THE STATE PROGRAM TO THE REST OF THE STATE TERMS OF REIMBURSEMENT. SO BUT SENSUAL COUNTY WITH REGARD TO- A SALARIES THEIR SALARIES ARE SAMPLES WITH THE COUNTY- WHICH IS SEPARATE AND DISTINCT FROM- SALARY- RATE. FOR ST SOUTH AND THEN WITH REGARD Q. AND REIMBURSEMENT AND FUNDING FOR THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE PART PERFORMED BY L. A. COUNTY PARTNERS THERE IS THEN- ON AUGMENTED SPEED THAT IS CHARGED- SPECIFICALLY TO FACILITIES IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY- THE HIGHER COST ST- OPERATING IN THAT AREA. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY. THE COST OF LIVING INCREASE- I NEED FO ENHANCED RATES FOR THOSE FACILITIES- FOR THE OVERSIGHT AT THAT WORK. NUMBER LET ME THEN ASK THE QUESTION EXPLICITLY DO THE EMPLOYEES FOR ELLIE COUNTY GET HIGHER WAGES THAN THE STATE EMPLOYEES. SALARY RATE OR L. A. COUNTY- INDIVIDUAL BETTER PERFORMING THE WORK ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT- DO YOU RECEIVE A HIGHER SALARY THAN AND STATE STAFF YES SO SHOULDN'T PEOPLE WITH THE SAME JOB GET PAID THE SAME AMOUNT REGARDLESS OF WHERE IN THE STATE THEY LIVE AND WORK. AND IF IT'S JUSTIFIED THAT BY A HIGHER COST OF LIVING IN LA THEN CERTAINLY STATE EMPLOYEES WHO ARE IN SAN FRANCISCO SHOULD GET EVEN HIGHER WAGES DO THEY- OUR DEPARTMENT THAT THE STATE DOES HAVE A- GEOGRAPHIC AUGMENTATION OR- SALARY- AND REIMBURSEMENT. FOR STATE STAFF- THAT WORK IN HIGH COST AREAS- IT IT IS NOT DIRECTLY- COMPARE A BULL- AT AT THAT EXACT AMOUNT- FOR L. A. COUNTY- AGAIN THESE ARE. NO SALARY THAT ARE NEGOTIATED THROUGH THE LABOR PROCESS BETWEEN BEING STATE EMPLOYEES- VERSUS COUNTY EMPLOYEES- I'D BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE MORE DETAIL ON WHAT THE DIFFERENCES ARE BETWEEN THE SALARY- IF THAT WOULD BE. IN A HELPFUL INFORMATION IT WOULD I THINK I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF THERE'S A BASIC FAIRNESS. ISSUE HERE IS THE CONTRACT WITH L. A. COUNTY TAKING RESOURCES AWAY FROM THE REST OF THE STATE. AND IDEALLY MANY OF US LOOK TOWARDS THE RATES THEY HAVE AN L. A. COUNTY AND WANT TO BE UPLIFTED TOWARDS WHERE THEY ARE TO ENSURE WE CAN BOTH BE COMPETITIVE AND- RECRUITING AND RETAINING THE BEST TALENT AND NOT. ONLY HAVING IT BE IN LA. AND SO- WOULD APPRECIATE THAT FOLLOW UP AND WITH THAT I WILL.
