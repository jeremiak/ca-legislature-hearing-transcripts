THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FEDERAL FARM BILL REMOVED HIM FROM THE ALL FTA SCHEDULES AND RE CLASSIFIED HIM AS AN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT. THIS OPEN DOORS FOR CALIFORNIA FARMERS TO CULTIVATE HIM AND IT'S PRESENTED CONSUMERS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY ACCESS CBD THAT WILL NOT RESULT RESULT IN A HI. THIS IS BECAUSE BY DEFINITION INDUSTRIAL HIM CAN ONLY CONTAINS THREE TENTHS OF A PERCENT THC OR LESS WHICH IS A PSYCHOACTIVE COMPONENT IN MARIJUANA PRODUCTS.

NINE FOUR NINE ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOU CAN BEGIN ANYTIME YOU WANT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS TODAY I PRESENTS ASSEMBLY BILL. NINE FOUR NINE AB NINE FOUR NINE WILL PROHIBIT THE INSTALLATION OF UNSAFE TIRES. ON CARS WHILE MAINTAINING THE ABILITY OF RETAILERS TO SELL THEM FOR OTHER USES. CONSUMERS PURCHASING USED TIRES FOR USE ON THE ROAD. OFTEN NOT AWARE OF THE TRUE CONDITION. ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S NO VISIBLE DAMAGE. LICENSE AUTOMATED REPAIR DEALERS ARE MORE EDUCATED THAN CONSUMER. AND ARE IN A BETTER POSITION TO JUDGE THE SAFETY OF USED TIRES. FOR INSTALLATION. AB NINE FOUR NINE IS IMPORTANT CONSUMER PROTECTION BILL. IN FACT IT IS SIMILAR TO VERSIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED IN COLORADO OHIO AND YOU JERSEY AND WE'LL RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE WITH ME TODAY IS A SPONSOR OF THE BILL. JEFF SIEVERS REPRESENTING THE USE US TIRE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU MISTER MEDINA. SENATOR MEMBERS COMMITTEE JEFF SAVERS AND HALF THE U. S. TIRE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION. THIS IS THE NATIONAL TRADE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING THE TWELVE U. S.. HERE'S THAT MANUFACTURE HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. SAFETY IS REALLY THE NUMBER ONE CONCERN HERE AND SO WHEN WE SORT OF FOUND OUT THIS YOU KNOW OUR CODE SECTION HAS BEEN UPDATED FOR SEVERAL DECADES REFER TO THIS TIME DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT -- CONSUMER SOMETIMES SEE A LOOK FOR A MORE AFFORDABLE OPTIONS WHEN THEY'RE BUYING TIRES TIRES CAN BE EXPENSIVE AND SOMETIMES THAT THEY'LL FIND ONES AND UNBEKNOWNST TO THEM MAY NOT BE SAFE. SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS OF THIS BILL SIMPLY IDENTIFY WHAT IS AN UNSAFE USED TIRE A LOT OF IT IS BASED ON WHAT IS FOUNDED THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRANSPORTATION SAFETY ACT. AND SAY A TIRE DEALER CAN'T INSTALL AN UNSAFE USED. THAT'S WHAT THE BILL DOES -- I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY OPPOSITION AND THE REST OTHERS TO SUPPORT SOLELY RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE I GUESS THAT'S TO BE SEEN HERE IN JUST A MOMENT ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN FAVOR [inaudible] ALL RIGHT [inaudible] YEAH.

ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. CNN WILL BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS CENTER ARCHULETA. THANK YOU -- OBVIOUSLY IT'S A MUCH NEEDED BILL MY QUESTION IS IS IS TAKEN AS TO A DISCLOSURE BY THE CONSUMER. TO RECEIVE FROM THAT. pBE AS A SORT OF AN AS IS OR WHAT SORT OF DISCLOSURES GOING TO GO ALONG WITH THIS BECAUSE HOW DO WE DETERMINE HOW T ANYWAY DETERMINE WHAT IS SAFE AND WHAT IS UNSAFE. AND HOW DO WE PROTECT THE CONSUMER FROM THE TIRE THAT'S ONLY GOT FIFTY MILES LEFT. VERSUS FIVE THOUSAND MILES LEFT HOW DO WE ADDRESS THAT. SO THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY DESIGNED JUST TO PREVENT ED TIRE DEALER FROM INSTALLING IF THE CONSUMER HALF AS A BRING IT A TIRE IN -- FROM INSTALLING IT OR PREVENTING THEM FROM AT AND BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER REASONS WHY SOMEONE MIGHT BUY A TIRE THAT MAY BE CONSIDERED UNSAFE. MAYBE THEY'RE UNAWARE OF IT -- WHEN THEY WHEN THEY PURCHASE IT AND THEY THINK IT MIGHT BE SAFER THE CAR BUT THIS IS? THIS IS BASICALLY APPLIES TO THE TIRE DEALERS THAT THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO INSTALL AN UNSAFE TIRE. THE TIRE DEALERS AND THAT THEY ARE HERE I CAN ANSWER SOME THIS QUESTIONS ALSO HAVE THEIR OWN CODE OF GUIDELINES OF WHAT THEY NEED TO FOLLOW. UNDER THE BUREAU OF AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR.

BILL THIS IS ITEM NUMBER THREE ASSEMBLY BILL FOR A SEVEN WELCOME YOU CAN BEGIN AS SOON AS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF WE WANNA -- EXCEPT THE COMMITTEES CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS AND A I'LL BE BRIEF OF FOR THE SAKE OF COMMITTEE A. B. FOUR SEVEN WILL PROVIDE ALTERNATIVE TO THE CURRENT STATE. FLORA SKIPPY AND RADIOGRAPHY A CERTIFICATION PROCESS WITH A COUPLE OF WITNESSES -- IF YOU'RE OKAY WITH A MIXTURE [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CAM STONE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATION I DOCTOR ME HAND FROM UC DAVIS MEDICAL CENTER IS GOING TO EXPLAIN WHY CALIFORNIA NEEDS AN ALTERNATE PROCESS. FOR DOCTORS PODIATRISTS AND OTHERS TO BECOME A LICENSE TO USE FOR US TO BE IN RADIOGRAPHY AND SURGERY. THANK YOU CAN FORGET WELCOME DOCTOR. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JOHN MAN I'M AN ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON PROFESSOR IN FULL TIME ACADEMIC FACULTY AT UC DAVIS HEALTH. I'M INVOLVED IN THE TRAINING ORTHOPEDIC RESIDENTS MEDICAL STUDENTS POSTGRADUATE TRAINEES. HAVE YOU EVER BROKEN A BONE IF YOU'VE HAD YOU'VE HAD TO HAVE SURGERY TO SET AND STABILIZE THE BONE THE SURGEON LIKELY USE FLUOROSCOPY TO MAKE SURE THE PLACEMENT OF THE BONE AND THEN YOU NEED TO PLATE SCREWS RIDES OR ANY APPROPRIATE POSITION. IT IS AN ACCEPTED TOOL AN ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY WHERE BY LIVE ACTUARIES ARE SEEN IN REAL TIME. AND SHOT BY MOLD A MO BY MACHINE WITH THE ANGLE OF YOU CAN BE CHANGED. DRAMATIC FRACTURES AND THE YOUNG PATIENT AS WELL AS IN THE ELDERLY ARE FREQUENTLY REQUIRE THE USE OF FLORA SKIPPY. I'VE HANDED OUT X. RAYS THAT SHOW WHAT YOU CAN SEE WHILE USING FLUOROSCOPY. USE THE FLOOR OSCAR BEES PARTICULAR IMPORTANTE OPERATING ONE MORE TIME IS CRITICAL IN THE PATIENT IS RELATIVELY IMMOBILE. WE NEED TO KNOW THAT THE BONDS ARE WELL ALIGNED IN THREE DIMENSIONS AND THEN THAT THE MULTIPLE PIECES OF HARDWARE ARE PROBABLY PLACED WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE ALIGNMENT OF THE FRACTURE. THIS ISN'T DONE WHILE THE BONES CAN FAIL TO HEAL OR HE'LL IN THE WRONG ALIGNMENT AND REQUIRE ADDITIONAL SURGERY AND IS. MORBIDITY TO THE PATIENT. THE PROBLEM THAT A BEFORE SEVEN ADDRESSES WHEN ORTHOPEDIC SURGEONS MOVED TO CALIFORNIA FROM OTHER STATES ARE COMPLETE THEIR TRAINING THEY KNOW TO APPLY FOR THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL LICENSE. BUT THE REQUIREMENTS FOR A FLORA SKIPPY CERTIFICATE OFTEN TAKE THEM BY SURPRISE SINCE IT IS NOT REQUIRED IN MOST OTHER STATES. WHEN THEY APPLY FOR MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES THE HOSPITAL ASKED FOR THE FLOOR OSCAR B. CERTIFICATE? THEY REALIZE IT IS REQUIRED IN CALIFORNIA THEY START THE APPLICATION PROCESS PROCESS WHICH CAN OFTEN TAKE SIX MONTHS. NOT HAVING THE FLORA SKIPPY CERTIFICATE PREVENTS THE SURGEON FROM TAKING EMERGENCY ROOM CALL AND USING THE FOR US COULD BE IN SURGERY. THIS CAN BE DETRIMENTAL TO PATIENT CARE. PLUS TO BE IT IS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS THAT IS WHY DOCTORS SUCH AS ORTHOPEDIC SURGEONS WHO USED FOR US TO BE IN THE PRACTICE RECEIVE EXTENSIVE TRAINING ON ITS USE IN MEDICAL SCHOOL AND RESIDENCY. WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR PATIENTS AND WE ALSO WANT TO PROTECT OURSELVES AND OUR COWORKERS AS WE ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO THE SAME RADIATION DURING THE SURGERY. THAT'S WHY EVERYONE WORKING IN THE OPERATING ROOM THAT IS USING FOR US BE WEARS AN XRAY BADGE THAT TRACKS AND INDIVIDUALS X. RAY EXPOSURE OVER TIME. AND SPECIAL TECHNIQUE TECHNIQUES ARE USED TO MINIMIZE RADIATION EXPOSURE TO ALL PARTIES. WE ARE NOW ALSO ACQUIRED TO HAVE ANNUAL TRAINING AND FOR US TO BE RADIATION SAFETY. BY OUR INDIVIDUAL HOSPITALS IN A S. SIS OR AMATORY SURGERY CARE CENTERS. I WOULD URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TO CREATE ANOTHER AVENUE FOR TO PEAK SURGEONS TO DEMONSTRATE REINFORCE THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND RADIATION THERAPY. THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN FAVOR YES DIANNE SHIP YOU TO SKI EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATION. JUST WANT TO REINFORCE WHAT DOCTOR ME HAND SAID AND IS COOL PHOTOS THAT HE HE HANDED OUT -- WHEN A AND PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR PEDIATRIC PATIENTS WHEN THEY ARRIVE IN THE OPERATE IN THE -- OUR EMERGENCY ROOM -- DOCTORS CAN'T TELL IF IT'S A CLOSE FRACTURE AND DOCTOR ME AND CORRECT ME IF I GET TOO FAR OFF HERE THEY CAN'T TELL WHETHER THEY NEED TO OPEN IT UP AND ACTUALLY REALIGNED THE BONES AND PLATE AND PUT THE SCREWS INTO PUT IT BACK TOGETHER. FLUOROSCOPY IS A GOOD TOOL FOR THE SURGEONS TO EVALUATE THE FRACTURE BEFORE THEY OPEN UP THE PATIENT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IN THE O. R. AND PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR PEDIATRIC CARE -- ALSO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT -- TO AMPLIFIED THAT SURGEONS ARE EXPOSED TO RADIATION EVERYDAY IN-THE OPERATING ROOM THEY OF ALL PEOPLE. WANT TO BE SAFE FROM RADIATION EXPOSURE AS WELL SO THEY ARE WELL AWARE OF THE DANGERS OF RADIATION -- AND WANT TO PROTECT OUR PATIENTS AS WEALTH AND SELF SO WE URGE AN AYE VOTE GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN FAVOR. RIGHT SPENCER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PODIATRIC MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WE ARE CO SPONSORS ON THIS MEASURE AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT I THANK YOU. MR MEMBERS TO MAD RIVERS IN THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY IN SUPPORT. GREAT THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THIRTY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. COULD MAKE A WAY AT THE TABLE FOR A COUPLE FOLKS TO SIT DOWN THAT BE GREAT. WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE IF YOU CAN IDENTIFY YOURSELF AND YOU CAN BEGIN YES MISTER TURN MEMBERS BOB ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY. RADIOLOGIST I WAS HERE BOARD CERTIFIED IN THE SPECIALTY -- IMAGING AND RADIATION SAFETY ARE PROMINENT IN THEIR PRACTICE. OUR OPPOSITION IS NOT BASED UPON THE TECHNOLOGY IS WONDERFUL IT'S USABLE BY ORTHOPEDIC SURGEONS AND BY OTHERS ARE OF CONCERN IS WITH THE ADOPTION OF NEW STANDARDS THAT ARE UNCLEAR IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY ACTUALLY REQUIRE. THE PERMIT AND THE TEST WAS WAS ESTABLISHED BACK IN. TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE RELIGION HEALTH BRANCH OF THE SURVEY OF THE TRAINING FOR NON RADIOLOGIST PHYSICIANS AND FOR US COULD BE AND FOUND AND CONSISTENCY. THAT IT WAS BETTER TO HAVE A STATEWIDE PROCESS. AND IT HAS THE COULD BE ADMINISTERED TO ALL USERS OF AND THAT WAS ADOPTED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE SINCE THEN FOR OTHER STATES HAVE ADOPTED SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS. THE PASSAGE RATE ON THE TEST IS TEST IS NOT AN IMPEDIMENT -- TO USE OF AND WE DO NOT WANT TO BE AN IMPEDIMENT TOUSE. SO WE WOULD PROPOSE THAT YOU FIX THE PROBLEM. OF IN TERMS OF WHAT'S BEING ALLEGED BY THE PROPONENTS AND THAT'S THE THE DELAYS IN GETTING. THE APPLICATION AND PERMIT ESTABLISHED. SO WE SUGGESTED TO OF THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS THAT. THIS BILL SIMPLY SAY THAT WHEN A NEW POSITION COMES TO CALIFORNIA IS ALREADY DOING FLUOROSCOPY THAT THEY BE ALLOWED TO GET THE PERMIT IMMEDIATELY AND THE WITH A CERTAIN PART OF A PERIOD OF TIME SAY ONE YEAR THEY COULD TAKE THE TEST. THE TEST IS ON RADIATION SAFETY AND PROTECTION ESSENTIAL FOR ALL INVOLVED. THE PATIENT THE POSITION AND THE TECHNOLOGIST IN THE ROOM AND WE THINK THAT STANDARD IS REASONABLE -- SO THAT'S THE BASIS OF OUR OPPOSITION pRECOMMENDATION I WILL SAY ON THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS THAT UNDER EXISTING LAW. A RESIDENTS AND FELLOWS IN TRAINING PROGRAMS ARE EXEMPT FROM LICENSURE SO THERE'S NO NEED FOR THAT TO CREATE A PATHWAY FOR THEM IN THIS PROCESS. FORGET OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DOCTOR DOORS AVERAGE ME I REPRESENT CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF RADIOLOGIC TECHNOLOGISTS I'M AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY NORTHRIDGE. AND A RADIOLOGIC TECHNOLOGISTS I'M HERE TO SPEAK ABOUT PROTECTING THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA AND INSURING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ALL PATIENTS AND HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. DURING FLUOROSCOPIC PROCEDURES. THE CURRENT PERMIT PROCESS INCLUDES PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS TO PROVE THEIR KNOWLEDGE VIA AN EXAMINATION. TO ENSURE THEIR PROPERLY EDUCATED REGARDING RADIATION PROTECTION UNDERSTAND EFFECTIVE RADIATION ON HUMAN TISSUES. AND TO KNOW HOW TO DECREASE THE DOSE TO THE PATIENT. IN FOR OSCAR P. UNLIKE OTHER IMAGING MODALITIES THERE'S NO CONTROL OVER REDUCING RADIATION DOSE OTHER THAN WHAT THE OPERATOR DOES. FOR EXAMPLE THE EXPOSURE SETTINGS THE DURATION OF EXPOSURE ALL OF THOSE ARE PARAMETERS THAT THE OPERATOR CONTROLS. WITH THE RECENT REMOVAL OF THE JOINT COMMISSION'S ANNUAL RADIATION SAFETY TRAINING. IF THIS BILL PASSES COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATION TO PROTECT PATIENTS WILL BE ELIMINATED. THEREFORE THE QUESTION IS WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED OF THE PHYSICIANS TO ENSURE PROPER EDUCATION AND UNDERSTANDING OF RADIATION PROTECTION TECHNIQUES HOW CAN WE ENSURE THE SAFETY OF OUR PATIENTS AND HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS DURING RADIOGRAPHY AND FLUOROSCOPY PROCEDURES? ARE STRONG FLOOR LICENSURE LAWS HAVE PROTECTED THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA SINCE. NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR PLEASE HELP US PROTECT OUR PATIENTS PHYSICIANS TECHNOLOGISTS EVERYONE FROM EXCESSIVE RADIATION DOSE. I URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON A BEFORE SEVEN AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. PRICING THAT WILL BRING THE ISSUE BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ID OR YOUR WITNESSES WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND TO THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED HERE TODAY. SURE ABSOLUTELY I'LL BE BRIEF -- IF YOU WANT TO WEBER YOU YOU MAY BE A CORD THAT IF THE CHAIR ALLOWS US TO LOOK SIMPLY WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT OF A QUICKER -- FASTER AND MORE EFFICIENT PROCESS RATHER THAN GOING THROUGH -- THROUGH THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND WAITING FOR MONTHS THAT THEY COULD DO IT AT A LOCAL HOSPITAL. I MEAN THESE ARE DOCTORS PHYSICIANS ARE. VERY WELL EDUCATED IN THE MEDICAL FIELD I CAN TAKE A TEST AT A LOCAL FACILITY. FOR A CERTIFICATION PROCESS TO THE LOCAL FACILITY THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO TEMPER I TRY TO CHANGE -- STANDARDS -- AND IF I DO YOU WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION BEFORE I'M OPEN TO THE CONVERSATION ABOUT STANDARD IF THAT'S A CONCERN BUT WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS LET'S MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT LET'S HAVE AND HAVE THEM TAKE IT -- AT THE LOCAL FACILITIES. AND THAT WOULD NOT BE A REQUIREMENT A STATE LAW THAT WOULD BE A REQUIREMENT THAT THE FACILITIES PROVIDE FOR THE USE OF THEIR THEIR FACILITY THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING. TO YES ALL RIGHT. YOU WANNA ELABORATE ON THAT ANY FURTHER YEAH I'M I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED BECAUSE I THOUGHT I THIS YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME VIA MY HOSPITAL. TOOK A FLORA ASK ANNUAL TRAINING FOR OSCAR BE EXAM AS PART OF MY YEARLY TRAINING. AND MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THE JOINT COMMISSION WAS REQUIRING THAT. IN SO ALL OF US ALL MEMBERS OF UC DAVIS HEALTH -- IN THEIR ANNUAL TRAINING THIS YEAR WAS ONE OF THE FIRST YEARS WE HAD THE ANNUAL FLUOROSCOPY TRAINING EXAM. THAT WE WERE REQUIRED TO TAKE. OKAY ALL RIGHT UP QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. CENTER CENTER GALGIANI I'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I THINK ADDITIONAL TRAINING IS ALWAYS A GOOD THING BUT IN THIS CASE IT'S BEEN POINTED OUT THAT. THAT IT TAKES UP TO SIX MONTHS TO HAVE A A TEST APPROVED BYOUR OUR GOVERNMENT PROCESS AND I THINK THAT THAT ONLY HOLD THINGS UP. AND ENDED A DAY AND TIME WHERE WE HAVE -- AT THE TROUBLE OF ACCESS TO CARE AND AND PATIENTS BEING ABLE TO ACTUALLY GET THEIR PLANETS GET THEIR TREATMENTS. WE NEED TO DO MORE TO INCREASE AT ACCESS I'M THANKING YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD. ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER JUDGE CLOSE. I THINK MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRTH WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NIVEAU GET SENATOR HILL IS MOVE THE BILL. WITH THAT OF THE SECRETARY CALL THE ROLL THIS IS -- JUST BE CLEAR HERE. THIS IS -- AS AMENDED. AS AMENDED DO PASS THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS. HI GLAZER AYE TANK. CHIANG AYE ARCHULETA ARCHULETA I DODD AYE GALGIANI GALGIANI AYE HILL. HILL AYE LEYVA. PAN WILK YEAH. WILK NOW -- SO WE'RE GONNA HOLD THE ROLE OF CONTRAPTION MEMBERS OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PRESENTING. I SEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- COOLEY IS HERE. LIKE TO A WELCOME HIM TO THE COMMITTEE THIS IS ITEM NUMBER. EIGHT ASSEMBLY BILL. TWELVE EIGHTY EIGHT SEVEN ARE YOU CAN BEGIN -- AS WHENEVER YOU'RE READY VERY GOOD. COLLEAGUES I THANK YOU FOR THE PRAYERS REPRESENTING PRESENTING AB TWELVE EIGHTY EIGHT TO YOU. BEFORE I DASH OFF TO MY RULES COMMITTEE. OF AB TWELVE EIGHTY EIGHT RELATES TO PRESERVING. THIS MY VIEW OF IT. PRESERVING ACCOUNTABLE SYSTEMS. FOR CANNABIS DELIVERY IN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES HE EFFECTIVE VIA EFFECTIVE TRACK AND TRACE PROCESS. PART OF FOOD NOW CULTURE IS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH A TRACK AND TRACE PROGRAM. A FOR A PARTY MOVEMENT CANVASSING CANVAS PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE DISTRIBUTION CHAIN. SO THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT ENSURING ACCOUNTABILITY AND PROTECTED AGAINST ILLICIT MARKET ACTIVITY. SUPPORTS QUALITY OF LIFE IN EVERGREEN CALIFORNIA. AT A MINIMUM INTEREST INFORMATION COLLUDED MUST CONTAIN THE LICENSEE RECEIVING A PRODUCT THE TRANSACTION DATE. THE COLD RIVER WAS A PRODUCT REGION [inaudible] EIGHT THIS BILL. ADDITIONAL REQUIRES THAT THE TRACK INCREASES MACU THE SALE POINT. AND WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS. A ONE AT RETAIL PROMISES REFUSAL EVERY. IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE TRACK INCREASES TO BE INTEGRATED WITH CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS SO CALLED CLIENTS. BY JULY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY SO ABOUT A YEAR FROM NOW. RECENT MEMBERS ALSO REQUIRE THE DELIVERY INVENTORY LEDGER. WHICH PROVIDES A RECORD OF WHAT'S ON THE VEHICLE. OF WHICH ALL DELIVERY DRIVERS ARE REQUIRED TO KERRY ALSO BE UPLOADED TO TRACK AND TRACE. THIS WILL ENSURE THAT SHOULD ALLOW FOR POLITICAL EVERY DRIVER OVER. THEY CAN COMPARE THE APPLE VERSION OF WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN A VEHICLE WITH WHAT IS PRESENT. THIS WILL PROTECT LAW FOR DELIVERY FROM UNDUE DELAY ALSO SUPPORT LAW ENFORCEMENT. JUST KIND OF MAKES A LITTLE CONNECTION. SO THAT THEY KNOW THAT THE VEHICLE IS STOPPED HAS WHAT IT SHOULD HAVE [inaudible] ON SO REQUIRED TO DELIVER INFORMATION TO WILL HELP ENSURE PRODUCT SAFETY. LET LONG FORCE A REAL TIME INFORMATION ON LEGITIMATE DELIVERIES. ARE BEING MADE ALLOW THEM TO FOCUS ATTENTION ON ILLICIT ACTIVITIES OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS A HALF BECAUSE OF COURSE. ANYTIME IN OFFICERS OUT THEY CAN ENCOUNTER SOME -- WITHOUT ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION LAW ENFORCEMENT MAY ACTUALLY DETAINED LEGAL OPERATORS BY MISTAKE. WAS JUST DESIGNED TO TIGHTEN UP THE SYSTEM. AND WHILE I'M SURE RESUMES OF CAUSE SOME CONCERN. I'D BE HAPPY TO OF RYSTALS CONCERTS BUT I DO FEEL THIS LEDGER COMPONENT. IS ABOUT MAKING THE SYSTEM ACCOUNTABLE WHICH I THINK SUPPORTS THE INTEREST OF THOSE IN THE INDUSTRY FRANKLY ALL OF UR CONSTITUENTS THERE'S A BROADER RANGE OF VIEWS ON THE GENERAL TOPIC AROUND THE STATE -- AND I THINK. MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW WHAT'S GOING AND LAW FORCE COULD CHECK ON IT JUST. CARRIES GOOD. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL GREAT THANK YOU SOMEONE NUMBER ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. IS COME FORWARD. INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. MY NAME IS JEREMY SIEGEL ON HIM OUT OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES -- EASE IS A GREAT SUPPORTER OF THE ATTENDED THIS BILL -- HE'S ITSELF ON SUPPORTERS OF POSSIBLY TWENTY RETAILERS IN THE STATE THAT CONDUCT LIVERIES HOWEVER THE THE FINAL AMENDMENTS -- BECAUSE THE LOGISTICAL ISSUES FOR NOT ONLY EITHER FOR ALL ITS PARTNERS THE OTHER THE CONCEPT OF A DELIVERY MANIFEST -- LEDGER DOES NOT EXIST IN OTHER STATES THAT CURRENTLY SUPPORT METRIC AND HAVE DELIVERY BUILT INTO IT. AND THE METRIC ITSELF IS A THIS IS ON THE TRACKS FROM A POINT TO POINT -- TRANSACTION AND DELIVERY AND FOR INSTANCE IN OREGON EACH TIME OR A DELIVERY IS IS A PLACE IN ORDER THAT IS ABOUT IT IN THE METRIC INCLUDES THE INFORMATION SUCH AS THE THE PRODUCT THAT ARE BEING SOLD IN THE THE FINAL DESTINATION. HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE HAVE A CONCEPT WHERE. RETAILERS ARE ALLOWED TO PLACE PRODUCT IN THEIR VEHICLES. THAT IS MY IT PURCHASED THIS IS THE THE INVENTORY THAT IS COLLECTING THE LEDGER. IS NOT YET -- ASSIGNED TO A FINALIST NATIONS OF METRIC ITSELF DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE THE CAPACITY. TO RECORD THAT NAM SO HE'S LOOKING FOR TO WORKING WITH. ON THIS ON AT A PERSON COOLEY TO DISCUSSES AND FIND A SOLUTION AT THAT DOES SUPPORT THE INDUSTRY AND ALLOW FOR THIS -- CONTINUED TRACKING TRACING OF THE THE CONTENT THAT THE COMPLETE -- PROCESS FROM SEA TO SAIL. AGAIN OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MR MEMBERS RAND MARTIN ON BEHALF OF CLEVELAND BLACKBIRD LOGISTICS -- TO CANADA'S BUSINESSES OPERATING HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA COOLEY OF AS ONE OF THE LARGEST OPERATORS AND I'M BASED OUT OF SAN JOSE. WE ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT WHAT THE AUTHOR'S INTENT IS -- THE ILLICIT MARKET IS ONE THAT WE'RE VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO KEEP THE ILLICIT TO TO KEEP THE ILLICIT MARKET FROM GROWING -- AND PREFERABLY TO MAKE IT SHRINK -- WOULD BE DESIRABLE UNFORTUNATELY WHAT THIS BILL DOES IN ITS CURRENT FORM WITH THE USE OF THE OF THE LEDGER IS IS CREATE AN ADDITIONAL. OUR WORKLOAD BURDEN ON THE COMPANY'S WITHOUT PROVIDING ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO THE STATE OR TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. WHEN WE TAKE A ORDER -- AT KHALIFA DOT COM -- FOR PRODUCT FOR DELIVERY WE UPLOAD A GREAT DEAL OF INFORMATION TO TRACK AND TRACE ON THAT INCLUDES ON WHO THE CUSTOMER IS WHAT THE PRODUCT IS INTERESTS ARE. THAT DOT THE LEDGER IS SOMETHING THAT IS CARRIED BY THE DRIVER THAT DEFINES WHAT IS IN THE VEHICLE AT THE TIME THE DRIVER IS OUT ON THE ROAD. IT IS EXACTLY THE SAME INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE JUST UPLOADED TO TRACK AND TRACE ON WHEN WE MADE THE SALE -- AT AT THE POINT WHEN THE CUSTOMER ORDERED IT. TO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DOING IS CREATING A DUPLICATIVE -- SYSTEM OF OF PUTTING THE SAME INFORMATION INTO THE SAME TRACK AND TRACE SYSTEM WHICH SHOULD SIMPLY ADDS TO OUR BURDEN. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT KHALIFA IN PARTICULAR BUT MANY OF THE DELIVERY COMPANIES ARE DOING THOUSANDS OF DELIVERIES A MONTH. THAT'S NOT AN INCONSEQUENTIAL AMOUNT OF WORK THAT WE HAVE TO ENGAGE IN IN ORDER TO PUT THE SAME INFORMATION IN A SECOND TIME THAT WAS JUST PUT IN. MAYBE AN HOUR BEFORE. WE WANT IT ALSO DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO LAW ENFORCEMENT LAW ENFORCEMENT -- UNDER OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE BILL CAN ACCESS THAT ON THAT TRACK AND TRACE MATERIAL -- AND THEY CAN KNOW THAT WHAT THE DRIVER HOUSE IN THE VEHICLE IS PRODUCT THAT WAS PURCHASED BY THE BY THE CUSTOMER -- WHEN WHEN THAT WAS ORDERED -- IF THERE ARE OTHER WAYS THAT WE CAN CAN USE FILL THE LEDGER OR THE OR THE POINT OF SALE OF SALE TRACK AND TRACE. TO TO TO GET RID OF THE ILLICIT MARKET WE'RE MORE THAN HAPPY TO CONTINUE HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH WITH THE AUTHOR ON THIS AGAIN WE SHARE HIS INTENT. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO FINDING A SOLUTION THAT DOES NOT CREATE AN UNDUE BURDEN ON US. GOOD ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON TRACY STEVENS REPRESENTING NOR CAL CANNABIS WE CURRENTLY HAVE A SUPPORT ON FILE PRIOR TO THESE AMENDMENTS WE TOO WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR. WE AGREE WITH THE INTENT WE'RE JUST A LITTLE BIT CAN LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ABOUT THE DETAILS AS WELL AND WOULD LIKE TO MOVE FORWARD WORKING WITH HIM TO CLARIFY THIS THANK YOU. VERY GOOD ANY OTHER WITNESSES YES YES AMY JENKINS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION WE TO HAVE A SUPPORT POSITION ON THE BILL. BUT DUE TO CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY OUR MEMBERS SEASON CLEAVER AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR TO TRY TO RESOLVE THOSE CONCERNS THANK YOU ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER WITNESSES. FAVOR AGAINST WINNERS ALL RIGHT WILL BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SYSTEM IN. WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED I'M SURE THAT'S A LIKE THE QUESTION FOR MY COLLEAGUES. WELL I THINK OF I APPRECIATE THE FACT THE INDUSTRIES HERE AND THAT THEY DID NOT COORDINATED ANNE'S SAYS THEY HAVE. OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF COMPLIANCE ISSUES AND I'M HEARING FROM COOLEY BUT THEY'RE SORT OF WANT TO SAY WE ALREADY DO IT THE OTHER ONE SAYS WE CAN'T DO IT BECAUSE IT'S COMPLICATED THINGS. ARE. I'LL JUST HAVE A STANDPOINT OF ON A I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT. PROVIDE AN ELECTRONIC RECORD THAT ALONG FOR SOME SHE CAN PULL DOWN. THE DOCUMENTS WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO FIND THE VEHICLE. I THINK THAT SUPPORTS A TYPE OF ACCOUNTABILITY IS IT HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE PUBLIC WOULD SUPPORT. I THINK IT MAKES FOR EASIER ENCOUNTERS BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND DELIVERY DRIVER ON I AM CERTAINLY WILLING TO TALK WITH FOLKS BUT I ACTUALLY. OF WHEN I LOOK AT THE STATUTE. THERE IS NOT THE PARTICULARITY AS TO WHAT'S ACTUALLY IN THE VEHICLE -- THERE'S BEEN ADDED BY THIS LEDGER -- I AM I WILL SAY I'M NOT WEDDED TO A PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY SOLUTION AS TO HOW THE WHAT LEDGER GETS -- CONVEYED MADE AVAILABLE. AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT TRYING TO FAVOR ONE MODALITY OVER ANOTHER. BUT I DO THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A SYSTEM OF ACCOUNTABILITY WITH THIS TRANSFER AROUND THE STATE. VERY GOOD THAT I AND I GUESS ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- ONE SOLUTION WOULD BE JUST TO CURTAIL DELIVERIES RIGHT IT IS WITH AND THE DELIVERIES YOU WOULDN'T HAVE ANY TECHNICAL ISSUES AFTER. THERE'S PROBABLY PROPONENTS FOR THAT VIEW SURE THAT THERE ARE SOME PRETTY SERIOUS PRODUCT TO HAVE OUT. HI IN VEHICLES AROUND OUR NEIGHBORHOOD IT'S NOT SO DIFFERENT THAN ALCOHOL OR OTHER THINGS THAT ARE SENSITIVE IN OUR COMMUNITY SO I AM SURPRISED TO HEAR. THE CONCERNED ABOUT -- SOMEHOW THE TECHNOLOGY IS NOT NOT THERE FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS. AND I'M SURPRISED ME YEAH. IF I MAY I THINK WORKERS I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AND CLOSE THE LOOP MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO ME. THANK ON I APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP AND TRYING TO DO THAT AND SO I AM A LITTLE SURPRISED AND BUT I ASSUME YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THAT. THE OPPONENTS WHO ARE HERE TODAY TO TRY TO SEE IF YOU CAN WORK THROUGH THEIR ISSUES IS THE BILL WAS FORWARD. INDEED I WILL AND I WANT TO SAY YOU KNOW FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES WE SAT IN THIS HEARING ROOM AND DISCUSSED OUR BILL WITH YOUR PREDECESSORS THE MEDICAL BILLS. I HAVE A HUGE CONCERN ON THE ACCESS OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA TO FOLKS WHO NEED. I THINK THAT IN IN THE BIG RUSH TO RECREATIONAL. I SORT OF FEEL WE STEP BACKWARDS A LITTLE BIT IN LETTING FOLKS FOR WHOM. THERE'S A MEDIC MEDICALLY INDICATED USE AND I THINK THE AFFORDABLE AND EASE OF ACCESS TO THAT POPULATION IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. AND SO THIS SORT OF I I DON'T FAVOR ROLLING AWAY DELIVERY I THINK IT ACTUALLY PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE. BUT I WOULD REMEMBER THOSE FOLKS ARE MOST FOR HOMELESS THERE'S A VULNERABILITY A HELPFUL REALLY THE WORK IN A VERY GOOD OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM MY COLLEAGUES. YOU'RE THE COMMITTEE THAT LIKE TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY CLOSE. QUESTION I VOTE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK IN THIS AREA I THINK YOUR BILL MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO ME AND I KNOW THERE'S SOME CONCERNS AND ISSUES. I HOPE THEY CAN BE WORKED OUT BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS A IT JUST SEEMS LIKE -- THIS IS A A VERY PRUDENT AND MODEST STEP FORWARD AYE AYE IT DOESN'T HAVE A PHASE IN. THEIR SUNSET DATE ON THIS RACE USE ME YESTERDAY I THINK THE START DATE IS A YEAR FROM -- THIS JULY. SAID IS THAT RIGHT. YEAH JULY.

AND YOU CAN BEGIN A TIME YOU READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PROUD TO SHARE PRESENTATION OF THIS BILL WITH MY JOIN AUTHOR ASSEMBLY WOMAN CRIED PETRIE-NORRIS. A BEFORE WE BEGIN WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO USE OUR BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS -- THAT ARE LISTED -- INCOMING FIVE THE ANALYSIS I'D ALSO LIKE TO COMMIT TO BROADENING THE LANGUAGE TO ENSURE ALL PRACTITIONERS WHO PERFORM PELVIC EXAMS INCLUDING NURSE PRACTITIONERS NURSE MIDWIVES. ARE REQUIRED TO GIVE THIS PAMPHLET OUT AND FINALLY I COMMIT TO ENSURING THE PAMPHLET IS CREATED IN BOTH SPANISH AND ENGLISH BY THE MEDICAL BOARD INTO RESEARCH THE POSSIBILITY PROVIDING THIS PAMPHLET AND OTHER LANGUAGES. I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ITS DILIGENT RESEARCH AND ALSO FOR ITS SUGGESTIONS. THIS BILL WILL EMPOWER PATIENTS BY GIVING THEM MUCH NEEDED INFORMATION GIVEN THE MORE INVASIVE NATURE. OF PELVIC PELVIC EXAMINATIONS IN RECENT HORRIFIC TALES OF ABUSE DURING THESE EXAMS IT HAS BECOME APPARENT THAT PATIENTS WOULD BENEFIT FROM ADVANCE INFORMATION. ABOUT WHAT TO EXPECT DURING A PELVIC EXAM. AB TEN THIRTY REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD IN COORDINATION WITH RELEVANT TRADE ASSOCIATIONS TO DEVELOP AN INFORMATIONAL PAMPHLETS FOR PATIENTS UNDERGOING. GYNECOLOGICAL PELVIC EXAMINATION. THIS PAMPHLET WOULD INCLUDE BASIC INFORMATION REGARDING HOW THE PROCEDURE SHOULD BE PER PROPERLY PERFORMED. PRIVACY AND SANITARY SANITARY EXPECTATIONS AND BOARD CONTACT INFORMATION IN ORDER TO REPORT ANY INSTANCES OF MISCONDUCT. AB TEN THIRTY REQUIRES THAT THIS INFORMATIONAL DOCUMENT BE PROVIDED TO PATIENTS PRIOR TO THEIR FIRST PUBLIC EXAM. THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT FEMALE PATIENTS RECEIVE THE INFORMATION THEY NEED IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND HOPEFULLY PREVENT INSTANCES OF SEVERE MISCONDUCT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE IN WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. IS CHRISTY LEACH A CONSTITUENT OF MINE WHO IS ALSO. THE SOURCE OF WHERE THIS BILL CAME FROM. WELCOME. THANK YOU I AM I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE MEMBERS OF THE BUSINESS A SENATE BUSINESS PROFESSIONS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF TEN THIRTY MY NAME IS CHRISTY LEACH AND I AM ONE OF MORE THAN. SEVEN HUNDRED SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASAULT THAT OCCURRED IN THE U. S. C. HEALTH CENTER AT THE HANDS OF DR GEORGE TEN ALL -- I AM ONE OF OF BETWEEN AN ESTIMATED 1-000-021-4000 STUDENTS THAT HE SAW DURING HIS TWENTY SEVEN YEAR TENURE AT U. S. C.. MY STORY IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT -- THAN MOST OF THE SURVIVORS AS I DID NOT -- GO TO THE STUDENT HEALTH CENTER THAT DAY FOR A GYNECOLOGICAL VISIT I ACTUALLY WENT BECAUSE I HAD A COLD SYMPTOMS THAT WERE LASTING WAY WELL OVER SEVERAL WEEKS AND I FELT THAT YOU KNOW I MIGHT NEED ANTIBIOTICS -- SO HE DIAGNOSED ME WITH THE SIZE SINUS INFECTION GIVE ME ANTIBIOTICS AND THEN HE PROCEEDED TO TELL ME THAT HE WAS NOT JUST A GENERAL DOCTOR BUT THAT HE WAS AN OBGYN -- AND CONVINCE ME THAT I SHOULD HAVE MY YEARLY EXAM -- BECAUSE IT WAS MY FIRST GYNECOLOGICAL EXAM -- I WAS NOT PHYSICALLY MENTALLY OR EMOTIONALLY PREPARED FOR A GYNECOLOGICAL VISIT -- HE DID NOT PROVIDE ME A DRAPE COST TO COVER MYSELF SO ON THE EXAM TABLE. ON HE TOLD ME THAT HE WOULD NEED TO DO A PELVIC EXAM TO CHECK FOR ABNORMALITIES -- HE DID NOT WEAR A GLOVE -- AND THE PELVIC EXAM -- TO EXAMINE THE INTERNAL ORGANS LASTED BETWEEN THREE TO FIVE MINUTES -- WHERE HE -- HIS HAND WAS IN AND OUT -- DURING THE EXAM -- I WHILE HE WAS EXAMINING ME HE TOLD ME THAT HE THOUGHT I WAS SO BEAUTIFUL THAT I COULD BE A MODEL. THAT MY MOTHER WAS PROBABLY SO BEAUTIFUL THAT SHE COULD BE A MODEL AS WELL AND HE I'M. SUGGESTED THAT I MUST BE A RUNNER BECAUSE MY VAGINAL MUSCLES WERE SO TIGHT -- AFTER THE EXAMINATION ENDED HE ASKED IF HE COULD TAKE. OF PHOTOS FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH PURPOSES -- SO WHEN I READ THE ARTICLE IN THE LA TIMES -- ON JUNE FIRST -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WHICH WAS TWENTY THREE YEARS AFTER MY EXAM -- AND NEARLY AS A MIDDLE AGED WOMAN I BEGAN TO DO RESEARCH ON WHAT IS EXPECTED DURING A GYNECOLOGICAL VISITS. I'M I REALIZE THAT I'M MY EXPERIENCE WITH GEORGE TYNDALL WAS NOTHING LIKE A NORMAL -- EXAM AS A PATIENT I WAS NOT PROVIDED WITH PROPER EDUCATION I WAS NOT GIVEN ENOUGH INFORMATION TO PROVIDE INFORMED CONSENTS. I WAS MISLED I WAS CLOSE HEARST -- I WAS VIOLATED [inaudible] I'M. AT IN MY RESEARCH -- I FOUND AN ARTICLE -- BY CALLED YOUR FIRST GYNECOLOGICAL VISIT ESPECIALLY FOR TEENS -- AND THIS IS FROM THE A COG WEBSITE AND IT STATES USUALLY DO NOT HAVE TO HAVE A PELVIC EXAM AT YOUR FIRST VISIT UNLESS YOU'RE HAVING PROBLEMS SUCH AS LIKE NORMAL BLEEDING OR PAIN. HAD I BEEN GIVEN THIS -- INFORMATION BEFORE MY EXAM I WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT AN INTERNAL PUBLIC EXAM WAS NOT NECESSARY AND IT WAS NO MEDICAL REASON FOR IT TO BE OFFERED OR PERFORMED -- ANOTHER PUBLICATION CALLED THE ANNUAL GYNECOLOGICAL EXAMS WHAT TO EXPECT -- THIS IS A PUBLICATION THAT IS ON THE UC SANTA BARBARA WEBSITE. IT STATES THE DOCTOR WILL IN MANUALLY EXAM THE REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS WEARING LATEX GLOVES THE DOCTORS WILL INSERT ONE OR TWO LUBRICATED. FINGERS INTO THE **** AND PRESS ON THE LOWER ABDOMEN WITH THE OTHER HAND IN ORDER TO PHYSICALLY FEEL THE FEMALE INTERNAL REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS. AS WITH THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF THE PELVIC EXAM THIS PROCEDURE SHOULD NOT BE SHOULD BE QUICK -- AND CAUSE ONLY MILD PRESSURE OR DISCOMFORT -- GIVEN TIS INFORMATION I WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT THE DOCTOR WAS VIOLATING MY RIGHTS -- THAT HIS NECK ITS FINGERS SHOULD HAVE BEEN GLOVED -- AND I WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT HIS MAKE IT FIG BIRDS ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO MOVE IN AND OUT REPEAEDLY. NOR SHOULD THE EXAM HAVE OCCURRED FOR SO LONG OR BEEN SO PAINFUL. I'M I ASKED THE MEMBERS TO CONSIDER A SIGNATURE REQUIREMENT BY LAW FOR AB -- TEN THIRTY BECAUSE IT WILL PLACE KNOWLEDGE INTO THE HANDS OF PATIENTS -- ANOTHER PIECE OF INFORMATION FROM THE A COG WEBSITE SAYS THAT THEY RECOMMEND THAT -- PATIENTS HAVE THEIR FIRST EXAM BETWEEN THE AGES OF TIRTEEN AND FIFTEEN I'M THAT IS MUCH YOUNGER THAN WHAT I EXPERIENCE WHEN I WAS IN. THE EXAM ROOM -- MY CONCERN THE IF A SIGNATURE REQUIREMENT IS NOT REQUIRED BY LAW PREDATORY DOCTORS WILL NOT BE INCENTIVIZE TO OFFER THE EDUCATIONAL PAMPHLET TO THEIR PATIENTS -- MANY MANY OF DOCTOR GEORGE TYNDALE'S PATIENTS CLAIM THAT HE DID NOT GIVE THEM A DRIP COUGH. AND THAT HE DID NOT WEAR A GLOVE -- SO I ASKED THE QUESTION WHY WOULD HE MAKE SURE THAT HIS FRONT OFFICE STAFF WAS -- OFFERING THE PATIENTS AN INFORMATIONAL POUND FAT PAMPHLET. AND THEN WHAT IS FURTHER ALARMING IS THAT HE WAS ALLOWED TO BUY U. S. C. TO QUIETLY RESIGN WITH A FINANCIAL PAY OUT AND FREE OF ANY SPOT OR BLEMISH. TO HIS MEDICAL LICENSE WITH HE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD THIS DESPITE COUNTLESS COMPLAINTS MADE BY VARIOUS PATIENTS. AND CHAPERONES TO VOICE CONCERN TO THEIR SUPERVISORS WINDOWS PRACTICES WERE INAPPROPRIATE. THEIR VOICES WERE NOT ENOUGH AND AS YOU CAN SEE IT ISN'T ENOUGH TO HAVE A CHAPERONE IN THE ROOM -- OR TO TRY STE -- THE ADMINISTRATORS TO DO THE RIGHT THING WHEN THEY ARE -- POSED WITH -- OF YOU KNOW I'M. IN INAPPROPRIATE -- DOCTOR -- I BELIEVE THAT A SIGNATURE REQUIREMENT WOULD HAVE ADDED ANOTHER LAYER OF ACCOUNTABILITY ON USC'S ADMINISTRATORS TO PROPERLY INVESTIGATE THESE VALID COMPLAINTS -- AS IT STANDS TODAY -- THE SEXUAL ASSAULT REPORT THAT I HAVE MADE WITH THE LAPD IS WELL OUTSIDE OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONSPERMITTED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- SO I HAVE BEEN EPRIVED OF MY ABILITY -- TO PROPERLY -- PARTICIPATE IN THE CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST DOCTOR GEORGE HANDLE -- I LIVE WITH PAIN AND FRUSTRATION THAT HAD I BEEN INFORMED -- THIS MAY HAVE PREVENTED ME FROM BEING A VICTIM. AND A PREVENTED HUNDREDS OF OTHER PATIENTS FOR ANOTHER TWENTY YEARS FROM BEING VICTIMS -- AND THEN JUST THIS MONTH. ON JUNE TENTH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE LA TIMES HAS REPORTED -- THAT ANOTHER GYNECOLOGIST IS UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR ALLEGED MISCONDUCT DURING GYNECOLOGICAL VISITS [inaudible] I'M. MY FAMILY IS HERE WITH ME IN SUPPORT -- INCLUDING MY THIRTEEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER -- SHE IS FORTUNATE TO HAVE A MOTHER. I'M INTERESTED AT ALL IN HER LIFE OU CAN EDUCATE HER. AND WARN HER AGAINST POSSIBLE SEXUAL MISCONDUCT OF HANDS OF PREDATORS -- SHE WILL BE PREPARED AND EMPOWERED -- WHEN SHE GOES INTO HER FIRST GYNECOLOGICAL EXAM AND SHE WILL KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO EXPECT? I'M WHAT ABOUT THE REST WHAT ABOUT THOSE THIRTEEN A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD WOMEN THAT ARE GOING IN FOR THEIR FIRST EXAMS. WHAT ABOUT -- IMMIGRANTS THEY'RE COMING IN. OF MY MOTHER IS -- AN IMMIGRANT FROM MEXICO -- SHE CAME TO THIS COUNTRY WHEN SHE WAS ABOUT EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD -- SHE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE -- THROUGH ANY OTHER MEANS OTHER THAN BEING PRESENTED WITH THIS FORM -- TO BE PREPARED YOU CAN. YOU COULD JUST WRAP UP NOT THAT BE GREAT OKAY I'M AN THAT'S AND TING TOGETHER RIGHT I ASKED THAT WE ENSURE THAT ALL WOMEN. AND GIRLS ARE -- INFORMED ABOUT THEIR THESE MEDICAL DECISIONS -- ON WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO COLLEGE IT WAS IT SHOULD BE LIKE THANK YOU CHRISTY THANK YOU FOR COMING IN AND SHARING YOUR STORY. RAY JUST OF YOU. WHEN ASKED IF THERE'S ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT TO PLEASE COME UP TO THE MICROPHONE? JENNIFER SO MOST OF THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA AND SUPPORT. GREAT THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN FAVOR. THIRTY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. CREATE SOME SPACE THE TABLE FOR TWO WITNESSES OF THE GREAT. AND BECAUSE SAID THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT TO GO OVER TIME I'LL MAKE SURE THAT THAT YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIME AFTER HE CALLED. EQUAL TIME SO. PLEASE BEGIN OKAY GREAT I'LL START SO THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS DOCTOR HAILING Q. I'M AN OBGYN FROM DAVIS AND I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF OBSTETRICIANS AND GYNECOLOGISTS. WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT AND BRING THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE TO LIGHT -- AND WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE TIME AND WORK THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS PUT INTO IMPROVING AB TEN THIRTY AS WELL AS THE THOROUGH ANALYSIS THAT WAS PROVIDED. SOMEONE LIKE YOU KNOW THE A COG FULLY SUPPORTS. EDUCATING OUR PATIENTS -- REGARDING EXAMS AND MANY OTHER THINGS AND WOULD NEVER CONDONE THE SHAMEFUL ACTIONS OF DOCTOR TEN HELL. FOR ANY SEXUAL PREDATOR FOR THAT MATTER. THE STATUE THAT THIS BILL AMENDS ALREADY REQUIRES PHYSICIANS TO PROVIDE INFORMATIONAL PAMPHLETS TO PATIENTS REGARDING GYNECOLOGIC CANCERS. AND DOES NOT REQUIRE THE PATIENT TO SIGNED ACKNOWLEDGMENT FOR RECEIPTS -- WITH THE CURRENT GEE WHY AND CANCER PAMPHLET PROVIDERS LIKE KNOWLEDGE RECEIPT AND OF THE INFORMATION IN THEIR MEDICAL NOTES -- AND RECORD IT THAT WAY. DOCUMENTING THE PROVIDER NOTICE HOW WE ACKNOWLEDGE ALL CARE TREATMENT AND ALL INFORMATION THAT A PATIENT RECEIVES. DURING ANY APPOINTMENTS. UNFORTUNATELY THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN TODAY WOULD STILL REQUIRE THE PATIENT TO SIGN AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT THEY HAVE RECEIVED THE PAMPHLET. THAT THIS TO BE TRACKED IN THE MEDICAL RECORD AMONGST THE HUNDREDS. TO THOUSANDS OF ENTRIES. THE LEGISLATION SETS A NEW PRESIDENT ON HOW INFORMATION EGG IS A KNOWLEDGE IN A PHYSICIAN'S OFFICE. THERE AS I STATED THERE'S NO PRECEDENT FOR THE SIGNATURE REQUIREMENT AND IT IS NOT ONLY BURDENSOME FOR PATIENTS AND PHYSICIANS TO THAT FOR THIS TO BE TRACKED. AND VERIFIED PRIOR TO AN EXAMINATION BUT CAN HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FOR PATIENTS. FINDING AN ATTESTATION IMPLIES RESPONSIBILITY ON THE PART OF THE PATIENT. OR BY ON THE PART OF ANYONE SIGNING SOMETHING. IN PLACE IS AN ONUS ON THEM FOR KNOWLEDGE IN. SOMETHING THIS CAN CREATE SOME BARRIERS IF A PATIENT DOES NOT WANT TO SIGN OR CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE BEING ASKED TO SIGN THEN WE CANNOT PROVIDE CARE. A CAUCUS ASKING THE COMMITTEE TO REMOVE TWO WORDS FIND AND FROM THIS BILL. KEEPING THE PAMPHLET REQUIREMENT IN LINE WITH OTHER REQUIREMENTS. AND AVOIDING INADVERTENTLY CONTRIBUTING TO BARRIERS FOR OUR PATIENTS WHICH ARE ABOUT TO HEAR FROM. GOOD AFTERNOON -- MY NAME IS DOCTOR JOICEY TASIA I AM A RESIDENT PHYSICIAN IN OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY SERVING ORANGE COUNTY AND IRVINE. I'M ALSO A FORMER PATIENT OF DOCTOR GEORGE TEND ALL. I AM AS A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD FRESHMAN AT USC A WENT TO THE STUDENT HEALTH CENTER -- HOPING FOR GUIDANCE FOR COMMON GYNECOLOGIC PROBLEM SOME ABNORMAL BLEEDING -- INSTEAD I WAS CONFRONTED WITH ONE OF THE MOST HORRIFYING EXPERIENCES OF MY LIFE. AND DOCTOR TEN DAHLE DURING AN INVASIVE PELVIC EXAM JUST LIKE WE'VE HEARD TOLD REPEATEDLY TOLD ME THAT I HAD A BEAUTIFUL FACE. THAT I SHOULD BE A MODEL. AND HE GAVE ME EXPLICIT UNSOLICITED ADVICE -- ABOUT SEXUAL POSITIONS IN ACTS THAT I SHOULD TRY -- AS A PHYSICIAN NOW I LOOK BACK ON THAT EXPERIENCE AND MORE THAN FIFTEEN YEARS LATER. STILL FEEL THE ABSOLUTE SHAME. AND VULNERABILITY OF IT. IN FULL FORCE. THE ONE THING THAT STRUCK ME MOST HOWEVER. THINKING ABOUT MY OWN EXPERIENCE IN THE EXPERIENCE. OF MANY OF THE WOMEN THAT I SERVE. IS HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS TO COME FORWARD. I SUPPORT ARMING ARE YOUNG WOMEN WITH KNOWLEDGE REGARDING THEIR SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. I DO NOT HOWEVER. SUPPORT PLACING MORE RESPONSIBILITY ON SURVIVORS WHICH IS WHAT I THINK THE SIGNATURE REQUIREMENT OF AB TEN THIRTY DOES. WE HAVE TOO MUCH OF WOMEN. WE DRESSED CONSERVATIVELY. WE SMILE WERE NICE TO STRANGERS. WE DON'T LEAVE OUR DRINKS UNATTENDED WE WALKED DOWN STREETS ALONE WITH KEYS IN HAND WE CALL OUR FRIENDS TO MAKE SURE THEY GET HOME. MY FEARS THAT THE SIGNATURE REQUIREMENT OF THIS BILL WILL MAKE YOUNG WOMEN FEEL THAT BY SIGNING THIS FORM IT'S NO THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO PREVENT ABUSE FROM HAPPENING. IF I WHEN I WAS SEVENTEEN HAD SIGNED A PIECE OF PAPER. STATING THAT I KNEW THE NORMAL COMPONENTS OF THE PUBLIC EXAMINE IT HAD STILL HAPPEN TO ME. I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO KEEP FROM BLAMING MYSELF. FOR NOT STOPPING IT WHEN IT HAPPENED OR FEELING AT FAULT FIRST MAYBE SIGNING THE FORM AND NOT HAVING READ IT. AND NOW FEELING RELUCTANT TO REPORT YEARS LATER. DOCTORS OFFICES SHOULD BE THE LAST PLACE AND A YOUNG WOMAN SHOULD FEEL UNSAFE. I ASK YOU BOTH AS A PATIENT AND AS A PHYSICIAN TO REMOVE THE SIGNATURE REQUIREMENT FROM THIS BILL. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO PLACE THE RESPONSIBILITY ON SURVIVORS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. VERY GOOD THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND YOUR COURAGE. AND FORTITUDE AND FOR BEING HERE TODAY TO SHARE YOUR STORY SO WE SHOULD AGREE MUCH -- ANY OTHER -- WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. BRENT SPENCE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS WE HAVE A PROPOSAL SUBMITTED ASKING AT THE SEAMS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MORE CARVALLO THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION ALSO ASKING THAT THE SIGNATURE REQUIREMENT BE REMOVED WITHIN OPPOSE UNLESS AMEND POSITION. VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY. THE NO OTHER WITNESSES -- AND OPPOSITION WILL BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS. MEMBERS COMMENTS QUESTIONS. THE CENTER LEYVA CENTER PAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU FOR YOUR POWERFUL TESTIMONY AND ONLY GOT HALF OF IT BUT THANK YOU FOR COMING FORWARD IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DO -- I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S BRINGING THIS FORWARD I TO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE AT THE SIGNATURE FOR SOME OF THE REASONS OUTLINED -- I WOULD AND I DO APOLOGIZE AGAIN FOR BEING LATE WE WERE IN -- BUDGET. WHAT WHAT IS THE NEED FOR THE SIGNATURE? SO JUST TO BE CLEAR AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS WAS CLEARED AND WHEN I PERCENT OF THIS IS FOR FIRST TIME PATIENTS ONLY. WOMEN THAT ARE GOING TO FIRST TIME GOT A DOCTOR'S OFFICE AND THE REASON WHY WE'RE WE'RE ADDING. THE SIGNATURE AS WE WANT THE WE WANT TO PROVIDE AS MUCH CERTAINTY AS POSSIBLE. GIVEN THAT YOU CAN'T FORCE SOMEBODY TO READ SOMETHING EVEN IF IT PASSED THE FATE A STATE LAW SOMEBODY CAN RESULT IN WHETHER NOT WHAT WHETHER THEY CHOOSE TO OR NOT. BUT THE GOAL IS BY ADDING THE REQUIREMENT OF THE SIGNATURE YOU CREATE A HIGHER LIKELIHOOD THAT THE LEAST REVIEW AND LOOK AT THE INFORMATION THAT IS BEING PROVIDED TO THEM. IN REVIEWING THAT INFORMATION YOU'RE NOT WAVING YOUR RIGHT TO SUE LATER IF YOU ARE -- TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BUT WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS CREATE A SAID I MEAN LOOK AT WAY OUT WE WANT TO CREATE A SITUATION WE CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION AND THE STATE SHOULD BE THE ONE PROVIDING THAT IN OR REQUIRING THAT THAT INFORMATION BE PROVIDED. WE'RE ALL. BUSY IN OUR LIVES WE GO TO THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE WE GETHANDED A LOT OF THINGS THINGS THAT WERE NOT REQUIRED TO SIGN AND THINGS. BECAUSE WE DON'T THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT WE REALLY PROBABLY DON'T READ AND DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO SO WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS CREATE A SITUATION WHERE WE'RE NOT TRYING TO PUT ANY ONEROUS ON THAT PATIENT WILL WERE TRYING TO DO IS. KNOWLEDGE IS POWER THE MORE INFORMATION YOU CAN GO INTO A SITUATION WITH THE BETTER YOU CAN BE PROTECTED IT'S NOT LIKE WE BELIEVE THAT. THE EN EL A DOCTOR IS MORE. THIS IS UNLIKELY THAT THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN BUT IT IT CAN HAPPEN. AND SELL BECAUSE IT CAN HAPPEN THE STATE REALLY HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE SOME TYPE OF REQUIREMENT IN LAW THAT THERE BE. THE GREATEST LIKELIHOOD AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE PATIENTS CAN REVIEW THE INFORMATION SO THAT THEY CAN AT LEAST PROTECT THEMSELVES IF THEY'RE GOING IT ALONE. AND THEY DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE GOING IN WITH THE PREDATOR OR NOT AND THAT'S WHY. I AND I WOULD JUST I WOULD I WOULD I WOULD ADD ONE THING SO I THINK IN YOUR TESTIMONY YOU SAID THAT THERE WAS NO PRECEDENT. FOR REQUIRING A SIGNATURE ON ANY FORMS THAT ARE GIVEN I WOULD SAY THAT. THERE REALLY IS NO PRECEDENT FOR WHAT WE'VE DISCOVERED WHICH IS IN A GYNECOLOGIST WHO HAVE ABUSED. SEVEN HUNDRED WOMEN AND COUNTING. AND SO IN MY MIND THE REASON FOR REQUIRING THE SIGNATURE. IS NOT TO PUT THE ONUS ON THE WOMAN WHO'S RECEIVING NAPA TO PUT THE ONUS ON THE POTENTIALLY PREDATORY DOCTOR. WHO'S PASSING OUT THIS FORM RIGHT SO IF YOU'RE A GOOD DOCTOR IN THE STATE TELLS YOU TO PASS OUT A FORM YOU'RE GONNA PASS OUT THE FORM. IF YOU'RE SOMEONE WHO'S MOLESTING SEVEN HUNDRED WOMEN GUESS WHAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PASS OUT THE FORM. SO IN MY MIND IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE ACTUALLY GET THIS IN FRONT OF THE WOMEN WHO NEED IT AND I WOULD JUST ALSO REITERATE. THAT NOTHING ABOUT THE SIGNATURE SAYS. AND I RECEIVED AN EXAMINATION THAT. THAT WAS THIS IT SIMPLY SAYS I ACKNOWLEDGE I WAS GIVEN THIS INFORMATION BY MY DOCTOR. WHICH I AGREE WITH ALL THAT AND THE MORE INFORMATION THE BETTER I TOTALLY AGREE -- IF YOU DON'T GROW UP IN A HOME WHERE YOU'RE GIVEN INFORMATION ARE YOU DON'T GROW UP WITH A MOTHER WHO TELLS YOU WHAT THE EXAM IS GOING TO BE LIKE. BUT AS SOMEONE WHO WORKED IN THE LABOR MOVEMENT FOR TWENTY YEARS BUT PEOPLE SIGN SOMETHING AT WORK EVEN IF IT IS JUST SAYING THAT THEY RECEIVED IT. EXACTLY TO YOUR POINT LATER ON THEY THINK I DID SOMETHING WRONG THEY WON'T COME FORWARD BECAUSE THEY THINK I SIGN AWAY MY RIGHTS. AND YOU WE CAN TELL PEOPLE THAT THEY DIDN'T WE CAN TELL PEOPLE THAT IT'S JUST YOUR CITING THAT YOU JUST LIKE A TRAFFIC TICKET WHEN YOU SIGN IT YOU'RE NOT ADMITTING TO GUILT YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT YOU RECEIVED IT. BROWN ABOUT ALL OF YOU BUT I DID KNOW THAT FOR YEARS I THOUGHT THAT WHEN I THAT'S I'VE HAD THAT MAY TRAFFIC TICKETS BUT IF I DID. BUT I JUST THINK THAT I WOULD I READ I LOVE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE SO MANY WOMEN THAT HAVE NO IDEA THAT WHAT THESE DOCTORS ARE DOING ARE A JUST AND THAT'S WRONG. AND AGAINST THE LAW BUT I REALLY DO HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANCE EARNS ABOUT THE SIGNATURE I DON'T KNOW THAT IT HELPS IT ANYMORE -- I WOULD LOVE TO TELL YOU THAT WHEN I'M HEADED SEVEN THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE AND I SIGNED IT I READ ALL OF IT. I DON'T WE'RE ALL IN IN A HURRY. I DON'T KNOW THAT IT MAKES. A WOMAN READ IT ANYMORE -- IF SHE HAS TO SIGN IT AND IF SHE DOESN'T. SO I GUESS WHAT I WOULD JUST ASK IS IF YOU CAN REALLY LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE FROM TWENTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE PEOPLE SIGNING DOCUMENTS. AND THEY THINK THAT THEY HAVE SIGNED THEIR RIGHTS AWAY AND I AM WORRIED -- IT WITH THE EXAMPLE EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID IS THAT LATER ON A WOMAN WILL FIND THAT SHE WAS -- ABUSE OR TREATED -- WRONGLY AND SHE'LL THINK WE'LL THING AND I SIGNED THAT DOCUMENT AND NOW. I CAN'T DO ANYTHING SO JUST FROM LIFE EXPERIENCE IT WORRIES ME. THAT ARE NOT APPRECIATE THAT CENTER AND WILL CONTINUE TO WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION WE'VE GONE OVER A COUPLE DIFFERENT IDEAS BUT WE JUST HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LAND ANYTHING ELSE THAT WE THINK IS SUFFICIENT THIS. WE WE HAVE MARK MARK. COMMENTS TO COME SO AT CENTER PAN OF NEXT. THANK YOU AND SUMMER CALLED OUT FIRST OF ALL I I I DO WANT TO THANK YOU -- FOR WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO -- WITH WITH THE BILL -- BUT I ALSO SHARE THE CONCERN OF OF THE OPPOSITION. IT WAS YOU I AND THAT -- ABOUT. WHAT THE SIGNATURE DOZEN A I THINK YOU HEARD THE THE -- HOPEFULLY MOVED TO YOU MOVING TESTIMONY OF AS WELL -- ACTUALLY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FIRST MANY OF THEM. OUR PEDIATRICIAN. AND SO WEIRD -- YEAH WE HAVE. TEENAGERS. TO BABY ENGAGED IN SEXUAL ACTIVITY WHO THEN COME TO OUR OFFICE AND THEN THEREFORE SHOULD RECEIVE A PELVIC EXAM AND AND CERTAINLY AS A RESIDENCY PROGRAM DIRECTOR WILL WE SORRY EDUCATED -- FUTURE SHINS IN TERMS OF HOW -- TO WHAT -- NOT JUST HOW DO WE DO THE PUBLIC BUT WHAT HOW YOU KNOW THAT THEY NEED TO HAVE A CHAPERONE THE NEED TO WALK THROUGH AND TALK THROUGH EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WHY WE'RE DOING IT. SO THIS IS ALL PART OF WHAT THE EXPECTATION IS -- IT IN IN IN IN THE EXAM. AND RECOGNIZE THAT WE ASK AND OFTEN DO MANY OF THE FIRST POLITICS -- FOR FOR EXAMS FOR FOR FOR MANY YOUNG WOMEN AND CERTAINLY A PAMPHLET. CAN BE HELPFUL -- BUT I I THINK IT'S REALLY GOING TO BE THE WALKING THROUGH BUT I AT BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT. WHAT EXACTLY WHAT? THE SIGNATURE MEANS RIGHT IS THIS WAVE I'M DOING THE RIGHT THING -- THEY'RE TRUSTING I'M GOING IN THE RIGHT THING IF I'M NOT I CAN STILL HAND I MEAN. WE CAN STILL HAVE THE PAMPHLET. AND YOU CAN HAVE ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS IN THERE. BUT IT'S AND OF COURSE I PERSONALLY I'VE NEVER HAD A PUBLIC EXAM -- BUT EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT YELL. IT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU JUST KIND OF READ ABOUT GO OH YEAH THAT'S WHAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE HAPPENING TO ME OF IT THAT'S NOT HAPPENING TO ME IF THE PERSON WHO'S ACTUALLY PERFORMING EXAM. IN THE ROOM IS NOT YELL IS SAYING NO THIS IS FINE AND THAT'S WHATEVER THAN. WHAT YOU GUYS DO OR SAY WELL THAT'S NOT WHAT I READ IN THE PAMPHLETS BUT SO? I GUESS THAT -- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THEY HAVE THE INFORMATION BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THIS THE THE THE THE THE EFFECT OF SAYING WELL YOU KNOW YOU SIGN THIS THING AND WE CAN A LOT OF PAPER HEARTS TO PEOPLE AND PEOPLE SIGN A LOT OF THINGS. AND I'M NOT SURE REALLY MEANS ARE MORE LIKELY TO READ IT WE TELL SOME OF THE SITE I MEAN AT THE WHEN YOU GO TO THE FRONT DESK AND I WAITING BY KIDS I GUESS STACK INSIDE HERE SIGN HERE SIGN HERE SIGN HERE AND LET ME READ IT OVER. BUT IT'S THAT THAT MEAN IT THEY'RE JUST SOME THERE'S THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS THAT. THEY GET HANDED OUT AND AND I AM AFRAID THAT THERE IS AN IMPLICATION WHEN YOU SIGN SOMETHING I MEAN ANYTIME SOMEONE ASK YOU SIZE OF THE YOU KNOW YOU GO ON LINE AND THEY SAY WELL AGREE OR NOT AGREE TO ALL THIS. DALLEK PAGES AND PAGES OF STUFF LIKE AGREED BECAUSE I JUST WANT TO GET TO WHATEVER I WANT TO DO ON LIKE. WE'LL DO FEEL LIKE WELL YOU KNOW WHAT I SIGNED IT SO THEREFORE WHATEVER'S IN THERE EVEN IF I DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE READ EVEN I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND IT. NOW I'M IN A HURRY I JUST WANT TO GET MY EXAM GET GOING -- THEN IT'S POSSIBLE THAT AND THEN AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS FOR YOUNGER YOU KNOW -- YOUNGER WOMEN WHO -- AND MID TEENS THE OF WHAT DOES THAT REALLY MEAN TO WHEN THEY'RE SAYING WHAT DO THEY REALLY THINK THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE IN IN. AN EIGHT AND EIGHT I GUESS MY CONCERN IS IS WHAT SPEND EXPRESS THIS IS THAT. THEY MAY COME AWAY WITH THE IMPRESSION LIKE WELL I AGREED TO THIS I EVEN SIGNED SOMETHING AGAIN I SIGNED A LOT OF THINGS TO SAY AGREED TO IT I'M SIGNING SOMETHING FOR THIS PARTICULAR EXAM IS THAT [inaudible] MEAN THAT. IF IT'S NOT OKAY DON'T FEEL RIGHT ABOUT IT THAT. I AGREE TO IT ANYWAY IT'S SO SO I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THE BILL AND AND AND YOU KNOW I THINK THAT. THE IT'S GOOD THAT PEOPLE BE EDUCATED HAVE INFORMATION. BUT I AM CONCERNED THAT THAT THAT SIGNATURE. PUTS PEOPLE IN THE WRONG FRAME AND AND SO -- YOU KNOW I I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT YOU'LL STRONGLY CONSIDER REMOVING THE STATE I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU'RE. THAT IT'S CHEATING THE AIMED AT LEAST THAT'S AND STRESS SO FAR AND COMMITTEE IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE WITH WITH THAT SIGNATURE. ED I HAVE A COUPLE OTHER SENATORS I WANNA MAKE COMMENTS LUNCH A HOLE THAT JUST ANOTHER MINUTE. I'VE CENTER CHIANG AND SENATOR HILL [inaudible] NO [inaudible] YEAH. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FOR BUT I ALSO DO SHARE THE SAME CONCERNS -- AS MY COLLEAGUES REGARDING THE SIGNATURE ASPECT -- IMMEDIATELY WHEN I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS. IN A WOMAN'S BODY IS DIFFERENT AND AREAS. CAVITIES ARE ARE DIFFERENT AND WHEN YOU. GO TO AN EXAMINATION UNLESS YOU HAVE X. RAY VISION YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE A YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE. TO AS A DOCTOR YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE. TO TO EXPLORE AND I DON'T THINK THAT. I IN THE PAMPHLET. IT'S IT'S IT'S IT CAN BE ONE SIZE FITS ALL JUST LIKE. BODIES RIGHT AND SO HOW WOULD THAT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU SIGN SOMETHING A I ALSO AGREE WITH WITH DOCTOR PAN THAT -- AS A YOUNG PERSON THEY MAY THINK -- I'M JUST SIGNING THIS THING BUT WHAT DOES THAT REALLY MEAN SO IS THIS HOW THE THE EXAM SUPPOSED TO GO I MEAN I THINK IT CAUSES A LOT OF CONFUSION -- ESPECIALLY AS A WOMAN -- HAVING GONE THROUGH HEALTH EXAMS IT'S NOT EVERY EXAM IS THE SAME. AND THE PROCESS IS NEVER GOING TO BE THE SAME. BUT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE INFORMATION AND ALSO THE WALK THROUGH THE DOCTOR SHOULD BE TALKING YOU THROUGH AS TO WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE DOING. EXACTLY WHY THEY'RE DOING IT I THINK THAT IN TERMS OF A MORE -- TAILORED -- METHOD OF CARE IS BETTER THAN JUST A YOU KNOW. HALF WITH THAT I DON'T THINK REALLY GETS THE NEEDED PROBLEM THAT'S THAT'S MY PERCEPTION I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SIGNATURE ASPECT BECAUSE THAT MADE COURAGE SOME YOUNG WOMEN WHO HAD EXPERIENCE -- DOCTORS WHO ARE NOT DOING THE RIGHT THING. THEY MAY THINK OKAY WELL I FIND SOMETHING I DON'T THINK I CAN COME FORWARD NOW I WISH I HAD READ. YOU KNOW WHATEVER THIS. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO AND SO SO I DO HAVE CONCERNS AND I'M HOPING THAT THE AUTHOR CAN. WORK THROUGH THAT OF WITH THE OPPOSITION ON A FIND SOME. SOME OTHER WAY. SENATOR HEALTH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND UP. IS IT AYE I LOVE THIS REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY WE HAVE EVERYONE HAS DIFFERENT OPINIONS AND AND MINE IS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE ONES YOU'VE JUST HEARD I I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE SIGNATURE. I THINK THAT -- IT'S JUST SINCE YOU'VE INDICATED ONLY. SIGNIFIES THAT YOU RECEIVE THE PAMPHLET -- AND THERE IS A PRECEDENT I HAVE LEGISLATION TO YEARS AGO IF A DOCTOR IS ON PROBATION FOR SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. SUBSTANCE ABUSE OR OTHER THINGS THEY HAVE TO GIVE. THAT INFORMATION TO THE PATIENT. AND THE PATIENT HAS TO SIGNED RECEIPT OF THAT INFORMATION SO THAT THEY KNOW THAT THEY HAVE IT. AND THE OTHER PART THAT I FIND IF YOU TRUST IN THE POSITION OF DOCTOR TYNDALL WHO WE KNOW VIOLATED SO MANY WOMEN. THAT HE GAVE THIS INFORMATION TO THEM. AND HE JUST NOTED IN HIS HE WOULD NOTED AND PROBABLY NOT DO IT AND NO ONE WOULD EVER KNOW AND THEY CERTAINLY WOULD NOT HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THAT INFORMATION THAT I THINK. IS CRUCIAL FOR AN UNDERSTANDING THE SPECIALLY FOR THAT FIRST TIME -- SO I'LL BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL AND I THINK THE SIGNATURE IS JUST. WHAT IT IS? A KNOWLEDGE MINT OF RECEIPT OF A PIECE OF PAPER WITH INFORMATION ON ALL RIGHT -- LET ME AT THE SHARE MY THOUGHTS -- I PERCENT PRECIADO THANK THE GOOD CONVERSATION WITHOUT AROUND THE AROUND THE TABLE TODAY. BUT THE SO I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH YOU -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND AND TALKED OF ALL SIDES OF THE MATTER -- PRIOR TO THIS HEARING AND FIRST I APPRECIATE THAT THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED ABOUT THE PHRASE UNDERSTAND SIGNED THAT YOU. RECEIVE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'VE THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THAT. THAT FUNCTION OF UNDERSTANDING IS GONNA BE INTERPRETED DIFFERENTLY AND THAT YOU'VE AGREED AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL TO LEAD TO DELETE THAT THAT REQUIREMENT. AND I THINK THAT WAS HELPFUL. AND SECONDLY THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE BEEN RAISED BY MY FRIENDS IN THE MEDICAL FIELD ABOUT THE BURDEN ON THE DOCTOR OF OF ACTUALLY. GETTING THIS PERSONALLY FROM EACH PATIENT. THAT YOU'VE ELIMINATED THAT REQUIREMENT AS WELL TO REQUIRE THAT THE OFFICE THE FIRST VISIT REQUIREMENTS NOT HEY AN ANNUAL REQUIREMENT. I THOUGHT THAT WAS A CONSTRUCTIVE STEP FORWARD IN TRYING. TO GET TO THE PROBLEM THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET TO WITHOUT PLACING MORE BURDENS ON THE POSITION THEMSELVES. THAT IT COULD BE DONE WITHIN THE OFFICE ENVIRONMENT [inaudible] AND THIRDLY WHAT. IS TO BE DEVELOPED BY THE MEDICAL BOARD. WHICH IS A PEER SUPPORTED ENGAGEMENT TO GET THOSE WHO HAVE THAT. THE EXPERIENCE I TO TO WRITE THIS THEN PROVIDED TO ALL THE PHYSICIANS I THOUGHT AS A VERY CONSTRUCTIVE STEP FOR THOSE WHO WORRY ABOUT THE LANGUAGE THAT MIGHT BE USED FOR THE DESCRIPTIONS THAT MIGHT BE OFFERED -- GIVEN THAT DIVERSITY OF FOLKS -- HAVING THIS PROCEDURE AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN THEIR LIFE -- I ALSO THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS A VERY CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT THAT WASN'T TRYING TO SAY THIS IS WHAT YOU MUST DO -- IT'S REALLY TRYING TO SAY THOSE WHO ARE THE PROFESSIONALS IN THE FIELD HELP TOGETHER COLLECTIVELY COME UP WITH WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE THESE THINGS -- AND I I A I AM SENSITIVE TO THE ISSUE OF THE SIGNATURE AND BUT I GUESS WHAT -- WHAT WAS PERSUASIVE TO ME IS THAT? LOOK AT THE STATUS QUO TODAY. THERE IS NO SIGNATURE THERE IS NO PAMPHLET. A WOMEN HAVE -- I HAVE -- FELT THAT IT WAS ALL THEIR FAULT FOR YEARS WHERE THEY DIDN'T COME FORWARD -- BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THAT -- IT WAS THEM WHATEVER THE REASON VERY AND REPAIR IS REASONS ARE. I'D THAT THAT'S THAT'S OUR CIRCUMSTANCES TODAY. AND IF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH YOUR LEGISLATION TO TRY TO MAKE IT BETTER. TO TRY TO FIND A AND AN AVENUE THAT COULD PREVENT THESE PREDATORS FROM UNDERTAKING THEIR THEIR WORK. FOR ME THE SIGNATURE OF RECEIPT SEEM LIKE A A MODEST STEP FORWARD WITHOUT A BIG BURDEN ON THE MEDICAL OFFICES THAT WOULD PERHAPS PERHAPS BECAUSE WE DON'T REALLY NOW. A POTENTIALLY COULD COULD MAKE A POSITION WHO WAS A PREDATOR THINK TWICE ABOUT WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO. AND SO IT IT'S WITH THAT BROADER UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORK AND THE GOALS THAT YOU BOTH HAVE -- AND THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'VE TAKEN THAT MAKE THE BILL FOR ME AN APPROPRIATE ONE TO MOVE FORWARD TODAY. SO THAT'S THAT'S MY THOUGHT ON THE MATTER ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM UP COMMITTEE MEMBERS SENATOR DOT. JUST TO BE CLEAR IT'S RECEIPT OLE NOT UNDERSTAND ANY OTHER FOR THANK YOU. THAT'S CORRECT OUR YET AT CENTER ARCHULETA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I THINK THIS IS A STEP IN THE IN THE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I THINK THE THE LADY WHO CAME FORWARD TOUCH MY HEART SO MUCH -- I WISH IT DIDN'T HAPPEN I'VE GOT TWO DAUGHTERS OF I I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE THEM GOING THROUGH THAT. BUT IF THERE'D BEEN SOMETHING ON THE TABLE THAT EVEN FOR A SECOND THEY WOULD LOOK AND MAYBE THINK AND WALK AWAY OR MAYBE THINK OR MAYBE SOMETHING THAT WOULD. INFLUENCE SAID DR IN TO BE CAREFUL WITH THIS ONE BECAUSE OF THIS OR THAT. AND YOU KNOW THAT THE SIGNATURE. IT IS SOMETHING THAT -- MIGHT BE A LITTLE SCARY BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT PUT SOMEBODY ON CHECK IN ON NOTICE. THAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO DO SOMETHING AND I'VE GOT A SIGNATURE YES I RECEIVED IT THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING. BUT IT'S THERE AND I I JUST CAN'T SEE THAT HOW THIS WOULD HURT -- SO I'VE GOT TO SUPPORT IT. BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I THINK YOU -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER ON THE RIGHT DIRECTION BOTH OF YOU -- IT TO TAKE CARE OF THE THE YOUNG WOMEN THAT THEY'RE IN SCHOOL AND AND IT IT'S GOT TO SEND A MESSAGE TO EVERYONE. THAT WERE WATCHING. AND UP. SO WHY I THANK YOU FOR IT AND I'M. THINKING OF OF YOU AND I'M TAKING MY DAUGHTER SO AGAIN I SAID I SUPPORTED I THANK YOU. YEAH. THAT ARE LEYVA I JUST WANNA SAY THAT I I JUST I JUST DISAGREE WITH THESIGNATURE AS I AS I SAID EARLIER AFTER TWENTY YEARS OF WORKING IN AN INDUSTRY WHERE PEOPLE WERE REQUIRED TO SITE FIND SOMETHING. THAT JUST MEANT THAT THEY RECEIVED IT AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS WRONG AND THOUGHT THAT THEY HAD SIGNED AWAY THEIR RIGHTS -- I DON'T THINK THE SIGNATURE HURTS ANYONE EXCEPT THE PATIENT I'M A LAYOFF TODAY. AND I'M HOPING YOU CAN DO SOMETHING BECAUSE INFORMATION IS GREAT. THE PAMPHLET THE INFORMATION I LOVE ALL OF THAT BECAUSE I STATED BEFORE A LOT HAS TO WILL GROW UP IN FAMILIES WHERE THEIR MOM OR SOMEONE TALKS TO THEM ABOUT WHAT TO EXPECT. BUT I JUST FEEL THAT THE SIGNATURE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING TO HOLD THE DOCTOR ACCOUNTABLE I AM WORRIED THAT IT IS GOING TO HARM THE PATIENT BECAUSE LATER THAT WOMAN WHO MAY HAVE BEEN. SERIOUSLY INJURED OR MOLESTED OR WORSE IS GOING TO THINK THAT SHE SIGNED HER RIGHTS AWAY BY SIGNING THAT -- ANYONE WHO'S HAD A PELVIC EXAM THE GENTLEMAN HERE BUT FOR US WOMEN. I'M FIFTY TWO YEARS OLD AND EVERY YEAR WHEN YOU GO IN YOUR YOUR LITTLE ANXIOUS AND WHATNOT SO IF YOU'RE A YOUNG GIRL A NEW PATIENT. AND YOU HAVE TO SIGN SOMETHING I JUST THINK THAT THE PERSON MORE HARMING IS THE PATIENT SO I HOPE WE CAN WORK ON THAT. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SOME CHANGES SO THAT I CAN SUPPORT ON THE FLOOR THANK YOU. OKAY WITH THAT I'M GONNA GIVE THE AUTHORS THE OPPORTUNITY CLOSE BEFORE WE WE COLOR. TAKE ABOUT JUST VERY BRIEFLY I THINK. INDUSTRY FALLS IN THE CATEGORY AS THINGS FRANKLY WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WRITE LAWS ABOUT RIGHT BUT WHEN WE SEE. WHAT? IS HAPPENING WE SEE HOW MANY. WOMEN HAVE BEEN HURT. I THINK WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING AND I THINK OUR GOAL IS TO ENSURE THAT. WOMEN HAVE KNOWLEDGE AND WOMEN HAVE POWERS THEY ENTER. IN INTO THE SITUATION. AND I THINK WHAT WE WANT IS WE JUST ONE MORE CAN ABILITY AND I I JUST FEEL LIKE IF WE HAVE THE THE SIGNATURE IN PLACE IT PROVIDES A LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY ON BEHALF OF THE OFFICE. IF. IF THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN REYES WELL AT IT WHAT IS THE OFFICE JUST SIGNS THAT I HANDED YOU THIS INFORMATION WELL THEN THEY CAN JUST SEND YOU THE INFORMATION AND SAY THAT THEY SIGNED OR THEY CAN NOT HANDED THE INFORMATION. AND THEN DECIDED ANYWAYS AND WHAT ALSO IS INCLUDED ON THAT PAMPHLET IS INFORMATION ON IF YOU FEEL LIKE THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS DONE TO YOU THAT WAS INAPPROPRIATE HERE'S WHERE. YOU CAN GO AND GET. YOU KNOW WHERE YOU CAN GET IN FOR MORE INFORMATION WERE YOU CAN FILE A COMPLAINT AND THERE SOME TYPE OF ABILITY FOR YOU TO GO SOMEWHERE -- TO TO SEE IF YOU WERE WRONG OR NOT IF YOU WERE WRONG TO TO HAVE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY BROUGHT FLORIDA AND THIS IS A MODEST STEP -- STATUS QUO HASN'T BEEN WORKING I REALLY APPRECIATE THE CHAIR AND THE OTHER MEMBERS THAT HAVE SPOKEN UP IN SUPPORT AND IN OPPOSITION THERE'S WORK THAT WE AGREE. HOW CAN CONTINUE TO HAPPEN -- AGAIN IT'S A SENSITIVE SITUATION. AND I'M A GUY IT'S AWKWARD FOR ME TO HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS BECAUSE IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME. BUT IT DOES HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH MY TO KEEP KIDS THAT ARE YOU'RE VERY YOUNG DAUGHTERS. I WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATED IF I THOUGHT I COULD BE OUT OF ONE DAY I AM IN A POSITION BUT I KNEW I WAS IN A POSITION I COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING ONE OF THEM WAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF AND I DID NOTHING. AND AND I FEEL LIKE THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY. TO PROVIDE A LEVEL ACCOUNTABILITY TO PROVIDE SOME INFORMATION THAT CAN HELP IN EVEN IF IT'S JUST ONE PERSON IT WAS ONE PERSON AND THAT'S BETTER THAN A ONE SO WITH THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY GREATEST FEAR. THAT I JUST WANT TO ADD TO IT AS I APOLOGIZE I DENY KNOWLEDGE YOU EARLIER SOME MEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS I KNOW YOU'RE SITTING THERE AND I RECOGNIZE SOME RECALLED AROUND BUT IN A SENSE IT WAS LISTED AS CALDERON BUT I WANTED TO JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. AND THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT I'M GONNA ASK FOR A MOTION JUST A MOMENT BUT I IN AND AYE AYE AYE ONE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THE YOUR WILLINGNESS -- TO WORK TO PUT MAKE SURE THE PAMPHLET IS AND LANGUAGE IN WHICH THE PERSON MAY UNDERSTAND YOU INDICATES BANISHES SOMETHING YOU'RE COMMITTED TO AND YOU LOOK AT THE OTHERS I WANT KNOWLEDGE THAT. I ALSO ONE OF THE KNOWLEDGE YOU WILLINGNESS TO APPLY THE THE LEGISLATION -- TO ANY OTHER INDIVIDUAL THAT'S LICENSE AND THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO CONDUCT THESE EXAMS WHICH IS NOT HAVE FORMAL TECHNICAL AMANDA BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT. I KNOW YOU INDICATED YOU WILLING TO TRY TO ADVANCE AS WELL. SO I SENATOR HILL -- MOVING THE BILL AND WITH THAT THAT'S THE SECRETARY TO CALL THE ROLL. MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE GLAZER HI GLAZER AYE CHIANG. ARCHULETA -- TO LET AYE DODD. DODD AYE GALGIANI. HILL HILL AYE LEYVA [inaudible] HAN. WILK. WILK AYE.

I WILL LET ME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTEEN FORTY IT'S A MEASURE TO SUPPORT THE MUSIC THERAPY PROFESSION. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE STAKEHOLDERS FOR COMING TO THE TABLE AND WORKING WITH MY STAFF. I WORKING WITH MY STAFF -- TO TO RESOLVE SOME OF THE OUTSTANDING CONCERNS. I AB FIFTY FORTY DEFINES A REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO BECOME A BOARD CERTIFIED MUSIC THERAPIST IN CALIFORNIA. MUSIC THERAPISTS ARE HELPFUL TO A WIDE RANGE OF INDIVIDUALS FROM HELPING AUTISTIC CHILDREN DEVELOP THEIR VERBAL AND SOCIAL SKILLS TO HELPING VETERANS MANAGE THEIR P.. T. S. D.. HOWEVER INCONSISTENCIES INCONSISTENCIES IN STATE REGULATION HAVE CREATED CONFUSION IN THE LICENSED PRACTICE OF MUSIC THERAPY. CERTAINLY PEOPLE WITHOUT CERTIFICATION EDUCATION CAN USE THE TITLE OF CERTIFIED MUSIC THERAPIST. AB FIFTEEN FORTY WILL MAKE IT UNLAWFUL FOR ANYONE FROM USING THE TITLE OF BOARD CERTIFIED MUSIC THERAPIST UNLESS THEY'RE REGISTERED BY THE AMERICAN MUSIC THERAPY ASSOCIATION. THE BILL WILL NOT REQUIRE A MUSIC THERAPIST EMPLOYED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO OBTAIN CERTIFICATION AS A BOARD CERTIFIED THERAPIST. I HAVE WITH ME -- STEPHEN BETTS RETIRED CINEMA COUNTY HEALTH SERVICE DIRECTOR AND BOARD CERTIFIED MUSIC THERAPIST TO SPEAK A OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS LEGISLATION EVER SPECTRAL ASK HER RIGHT. WELCOME SIR AND LADY. YOU MAY BE YET WITNESSES IN FAVOR. GOOD AFTERNOON -- CHECK LAYS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- IN ADDITION TO HAVING WORKED AS A MUSIC THERAPIST. AND IN HEALTH SERVICES I'M ALSO THE PROUD DAD OF A DISABLED SON AND THE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE CONSUMER. THIS PROTECT. THE CONSUMER FROM OF MISREPRESENTATIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY OCCURRING. AND HOPES THE CONSUMER TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REDRESS SO IF I CAN ASK SOMEBODY ARE YOU BOARD CERTIFIED MUSIC THERAPIST AND THE ODDS IS PROTECTED UNDER THE LAW. AND I CAN GO BACK TO THE BOARD -- CERTIFICATION BOARD AND GET THE NUMBER OF THAT PER PERSON I CAN APPEAL I KNOW THE PERSON WHO IS REPRESENTING THEMSELVES AS A BOARD CERTIFIED MUSIC THERAPIST. HAS A CODE OF ETHICS SAY THEY HAVE SIGNED AND THEY'LL FOLLOWING SO I AM SAFE I KNOW I'M SAFE. FROM THE PERSON OF FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE HEALTH PROVIDER WHO SEEKING HELP FROM AN ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONAL -- I ALSO HAVE THE SAME. REDRESS AND I HAVE THE ASSURANCE THAT THIS PERSON HAS BEEN ADEQUATE PLEASE -- EDUCATED IS SKILLED AND KNOWS THE OTHER HEALTH PROFESSIONS SO THEY CAN FIT INTO MY ORGANIZATION. WE ARE AT A POINT NOW WHERE AFTER THE RATIFICATION OF THE MENTAL HEALTH PARITY AND SUBSTANCE ADDICTION EQUITY ACT WE HAVE THE GROWING DEMAND. FOR SERVICES FROM ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IN THE AMERICAS. INSURANCE HEALTH PLANS ARE SAYING THAT THEY'RE RELUCTANT TO PAY FOR MORE HEALTH PROFESSIONALS I THEY DON'T KNOW THAT THESE PEACE PERSONS ARE REALLY SKILLED. SO THE CHANGE IN THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE HERE WOULD ALLOW ALL THE THREE PARTIES THE CONSUMERS. THE HEALTH SERVICE AGENCIES AND THE BOARD CERTIFIED MUSIC THERAPIST A COMMON TO THE SAME -- LITERALLY ON TO THE SAME PAGE AND GO FORWARD -- WITH THE SAME UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS A SKILLED PROFESSION. FORGET ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THAT WOULD BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS.
