THE SERGEANTS AT OUR SO

00:28:50.028 --> 00:28:51.062
CALIFORNIA HAS A LONGSTANDING

00:28:51.129 --> 00:28:52.931
EXEMPTION FOR PUBLIC UTILITIES

HAS A RETURN COMPONENT OF WASTE

00:28:56.434 --> 00:28:57.802
WATER.

00:28:57.869 --> 00:28:58.403
THIS UNIQUE FEATURE CREATES A

00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:59.204
SITUATION THAT REQUIRES

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:00.338
LEGISLATIVE ATTENTION.

TREAT WAIT WHAT WASTE WATER.

00:29:04.843 --> 00:29:06.044
THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX

THE DEPARTMENT.

00:29:14.352 --> 00:29:15.019
DEPARTMENTS APPLICATION

00:29:15.086 --> 00:29:16.621
NEGATIVELY IMPACTS AND

00:29:16.688 --> 00:29:18.456
DISCOURAGES RECYCLING IN OTHER

00:29:18.523 --> 00:29:20.758
GREENER USES --

00:29:20.825 --> 00:29:22.093
DO YOU SEE SINCE SAN DIEGO

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.962
PROFESSOR WATER ECONOMICS HAS

00:29:24.028 --> 00:29:24.529
RECENTLY WRITTEN.

00:29:24.596 --> 00:29:25.897
THE CALIFORNIA CAN ENCOURAGE

00:29:25.964 --> 00:29:27.765
WATER USE BY TAKING STEPS TO

00:29:27.832 --> 00:29:29.801
REDUCE THE OPERATIONAL COSTS

00:29:29.868 --> 00:29:31.202
ASSOCIATED WITH TREATING WATER.

00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:32.170
THE STEPS INCLUDE ELIMINATING

00:29:32.237 --> 00:29:36.574
SALES TAX ON THE CHEMICALS YOU

00:29:36.641 --> 00:29:36.741
ST.

00:29:36.808 --> 00:29:38.176
THE WASTE WATER.

00:29:38.243 --> 00:29:38.843
CHEMICALS ARE THE LARGEST SUPPLY

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:41.112
COST FOR THE TREATMENT OF

00:29:41.179 --> 00:29:42.914
WASTEWATER.

00:29:42.981 --> 00:29:44.549
ANOTHER KEY FACTOR OF FOR YOUR

00:29:44.616 --> 00:29:46.251
CONSIDERATION IS THAT THE ONLY

00:29:46.317 --> 00:29:47.852
BENEFIT SURE OF THIS EXEMPTION

00:29:47.919 --> 00:29:49.621
WILL BE LOCAL PUBLIC UTILITY

00:29:49.687 --> 00:29:51.222
GOVERNMENT ENTITIES.

00:29:51.289 --> 00:29:52.891
NOT PRIVATE TAXPAYERS.

00:29:52.957 --> 00:29:54.425
THIS MITIGATES ANY LOSS OF

00:29:54.492 --> 00:29:55.894
REVENUE TO THE STATE.

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.229
REVENUES MERELY BEING SHIFTED.

00:29:58.296 --> 00:29:59.564
BACK TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO

00:29:59.631 --> 00:30:01.332
SERVE THEIR COMMUNITIES.

00:30:01.399 --> 00:30:03.668
THE ANNUAL REVENUE SHIFT AT TEN

00:30:03.735 --> 00:30:04.435
TO FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS WILL

00:30:04.502 --> 00:30:05.670
WHICH IS WHAT OUR ESTIMATE IS IS

00:30:05.737 --> 00:30:07.572
VERY MINIMAL TO THE OVERALL

00:30:07.639 --> 00:30:09.507
SALES TAX COLLECTOR.

00:30:09.574 --> 00:30:10.942
AND WOULD FAR OUTWEIGH.

00:30:11.009 --> 00:30:13.478
WOULD BE FAR OUTWEIGHED BY THE

00:30:13.545 --> 00:30:14.445
INCREASED VALUE OF EFFICIENT USE

00:30:14.512 --> 00:30:16.314
OF WATER.

00:30:16.381 --> 00:30:18.316
THIS IS A WIN WIN SITUATION THE

00:30:18.383 --> 00:30:20.385
REVISION REDUCES THE TAX BURDEN

00:30:20.451 --> 00:30:21.886
ON LOCAL PUBLIC AT UTILITIES.

00:30:21.953 --> 00:30:23.388
REDUCES THE COST OF RECYCLING

00:30:23.454 --> 00:30:24.522
WATER VERSUS THE COST OF

00:30:24.589 --> 00:30:25.690
IMPORTING WATER.

00:30:25.757 --> 00:30:27.625
AND PROMOTES ENVIRONMENTALLY

00:30:27.692 --> 00:30:29.294
FRIENDLY ACTIONS.

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.262
ULTIMATELY BOTH AND ECONOMIC AND

00:30:31.329 --> 00:30:32.597
ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT TO OUR

00:30:32.664 --> 00:30:36.167
STATE THANK YOU.

STATE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR TO

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.348
REALLY GO BACK AND LOOK AT A

00:33:37.415 --> 00:33:38.683
NUMBER OF THE STATE'S --

00:33:43.621 --> 00:33:45.156

00:33:45.223 --> 00:33:47.358
TRADITIONALLY WE DO OPPOSE

00:33:47.425 --> 00:33:50.128
EXEMPTIONS AND CREDIT AWFUL

00:33:50.194 --> 00:33:51.295
NATURE OF THE AUTHOR'S INTENT

00:33:51.362 --> 00:33:53.197
AND LOOK FORWARD TO SUBSEQUENT

00:33:53.264 --> 00:33:54.699

00:33:56.134 --> 00:33:57.001
OPPOSITION.

00:33:57.068 --> 00:34:00.204
COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE

00:34:00.271 --> 00:34:02.640
COMMITTEE START QUIRK --

00:34:02.707 --> 00:34:03.975
SO THE BILL DOESN'T SAY RECYCLED

00:34:04.041 --> 00:34:06.477
WATER IT SAYS WATER RECYCLED

00:34:06.544 --> 00:34:07.745
WATER OR WASTEWATER AND YOU

00:34:07.812 --> 00:34:09.046
MENTION RECYCLED WATER AND

00:34:09.113 --> 00:34:10.782
WASTEWATER BUT IT'S FOR WATER AS

00:34:10.848 --> 00:34:12.216
WELL.

00:34:12.283 --> 00:34:14.619
JUST ORDINARY WATER TREATMENT.

00:34:14.685 --> 00:34:16.187
YES THAT IS CORRECT SO THAT'S

00:34:16.254 --> 00:34:18.322
PROBABLY THE LARGEST PART OF THE

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:20.358
EXEMPTION SO I DON'T THINK WE

00:34:20.425 --> 00:34:22.193
CAN CALL THIS A WASTE WATER

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.695
RECYCLING BILL UNLESS YOU WANT

00:34:24.762 --> 00:34:26.864
TO AMENDED THAT'S COURSE UP TO

00:34:26.931 --> 00:34:28.866
THE AUTHOR --

00:34:28.933 --> 00:34:30.067
ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF RUBIO BUT IT

00:34:30.134 --> 00:34:31.469
DOES STATE WATER AND THAT'S

00:34:31.536 --> 00:34:33.371
GOING TO BE THE LARGEST --

00:34:33.438 --> 00:34:36.007
IMPACT IN TERMS OF MONEY I DO

00:34:36.073 --> 00:34:37.809
REALIZE THE CHEMICALS THAT END

00:34:37.875 --> 00:34:40.611
UP IN THE WATER AND OUR

00:34:40.678 --> 00:34:43.014
BENEFICIAL ARE NOT TAX BUT OTHER

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.782
ITEMS WHICH ARE USED TO PURIFY

00:34:44.849 --> 00:34:46.250
WATER SUCH AS FLOCKING AGENTS

00:34:46.317 --> 00:34:47.485
WOULD BE.

00:34:47.552 --> 00:34:48.553
AND THERE'S A LOT MORE WATER

00:34:48.619 --> 00:34:52.423
PURIFICATION AND WASTE WATER A

00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:54.425
RECYCLED WATER.

00:34:54.492 --> 00:34:56.727
ACTUALLY IT YOU'RE PARTIALLY

00:34:56.794 --> 00:34:57.228
CORRECT IN THAT IN THAT

00:34:57.295 --> 00:34:58.729
CURRENTLY THE CALIFORNIA

00:34:58.796 --> 00:34:59.530
DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FORMALLY

00:34:59.597 --> 00:34:59.831
THE BOARD --

00:34:59.897 --> 00:35:01.732
HAS TREATED.

00:35:01.799 --> 00:35:03.267
WHAT THEY CALL PORTABLE WATER

00:35:03.334 --> 00:35:05.736
WHICH IS WHAT'S DELIVER THROUGH --

00:35:05.803 --> 00:35:06.304
TO TO OUR TAPS OVER WHAT WE

00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:06.871
DRINK.

00:35:06.938 --> 00:35:08.506
ALMOST ALL THE CHEMICALS THAT GO

00:35:08.573 --> 00:35:10.074
INTO THE POTABLE WATER HAVE

00:35:10.141 --> 00:35:11.876
ALWAYS HISTORICALLY BEEN EXCEPT.

00:35:11.943 --> 00:35:14.479
THEY HAVE NEARLY APPLIED SIXTY

00:35:14.545 --> 00:35:15.446
TWO FIFTY THREE JUST TO THE

00:35:15.513 --> 00:35:16.981
PORTABLE WATER THEY'VE IGNORED.

00:35:17.048 --> 00:35:20.084
THE WASTE WATER IN THE RECYCLED

00:35:20.151 --> 00:35:20.451
WATER PORTION.

00:35:20.518 --> 00:35:22.553
YEAH THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:25.423
FIRST OF ALL THERE ARE TAXES

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:27.425
ALREADY OWNED WATER WHEN THEY'RE

00:35:27.492 --> 00:35:28.659
USING AGENTS THE DON'T END UP IN

00:35:28.726 --> 00:35:30.795
THE WATER.

00:35:30.862 --> 00:35:31.629
SUCH AS THE FLOCK IN NATURE

00:35:31.696 --> 00:35:32.597
THEY'RE THEY'RE ACTUALLY AS

00:35:32.663 --> 00:35:34.899
HISTORICAL VERY OLD HISTORICAL

00:35:34.966 --> 00:35:36.868
RULINGS THAT ACTUALLY THEM

00:35:36.934 --> 00:35:37.468
EXEMPTED DOCUMENTS.

00:35:37.535 --> 00:35:38.402
THAT HAVE BEEN ON THE BOOKS FOR

00:35:38.469 --> 00:35:41.906
PROBABLY TWENTY THIRTY MAYBE FOR

00:35:41.973 --> 00:35:43.541
YOUR OKAY.

00:35:43.608 --> 00:35:45.877
SO THERE'S A WHOLE RACK CASE LAW

00:35:45.943 --> 00:35:47.812
THAT EXEMPTS THE FOUR O'CLOCK

00:35:47.879 --> 00:35:51.115
ABOUT THAT YOU BROUGHT UP OKAY

00:35:51.182 --> 00:35:55.686
THERE'S CASE HOWEVER YEAH.

00:35:55.753 --> 00:35:56.754
SO.

00:35:56.821 --> 00:36:00.157
SO WHY INCLUDE WATER RATHER THAN --

00:36:00.224 --> 00:36:00.925
YOU KNOW IF YOUR MAIN QUESTION

00:36:00.992 --> 00:36:03.361
IS RECYCLED WATER WASTE WATER

00:36:03.427 --> 00:36:04.595
WHY YOU INCLUDING WATER AS WELL

00:36:04.662 --> 00:36:05.363
YOU JUST ADDING SOMETHING WHICH

00:36:05.429 --> 00:36:08.866
COULD ADD TO CONFUSION LATER ON

00:36:08.933 --> 00:36:10.635
THE DAY THAT THAT'S A GOOD POINT

00:36:10.701 --> 00:36:12.537
AND THE CHALLENGE THAT WE THAT I

00:36:12.603 --> 00:36:15.406
SEE IT AS A PRACTITIONER IN THE

00:36:15.473 --> 00:36:15.940
IN THE MARKET.

00:36:16.007 --> 00:36:18.175
PLACES ARE IN THE OPEN IN

00:36:18.242 --> 00:36:18.476
INDUSTRIES.

00:36:18.543 --> 00:36:22.513
THAT THE TAX --

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:24.215
THE DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY.

00:36:24.282 --> 00:36:25.416
FLUCTUATES IN SOMETIMES IN THE

00:36:25.483 --> 00:36:27.218
WAY THAT THEY REACT AND AND AND

00:36:27.285 --> 00:36:28.219
ADMINISTER THE LAW AND SO WHAT

00:36:28.286 --> 00:36:29.487
WE WANT TO DO IS AND AND WHEN

00:36:29.554 --> 00:36:29.987
YOU LOOK AT THE WATER.

00:36:30.054 --> 00:36:31.322
IT IS REALLY ONE THING WHEN YOU

00:36:31.389 --> 00:36:32.423
WHEN YOU LOOK AT A BILL WHEN YOU

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:33.724
BUY YOUR WATER AND YOU GET IT

00:36:33.791 --> 00:36:34.258
DELIVERED TO YOUR HOME.

00:36:34.325 --> 00:36:35.860
YOU LOOK AT THE UTILITY BILL

00:36:35.927 --> 00:36:36.994
THERE'S A CHARGE FOR THE WATER

00:36:37.061 --> 00:36:38.095
WILL BURIED IN THAT IS THE WASTE

00:36:38.162 --> 00:36:40.298
WATER SO IT'S REALLY ONE PROCESS.

00:36:40.364 --> 00:36:41.766
WELL DEPENDS ON YOUR

00:36:41.832 --> 00:36:43.834
JURISDICTION.

00:36:43.901 --> 00:36:45.903
IN SOME IN SOME JURISDICTIONS

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:46.771
IT'S DIFFERENT IF THEY HAVE A

00:36:46.837 --> 00:36:47.772
WASTE WATER TREATMENT AND A

00:36:47.838 --> 00:36:48.172
WATER TREATMENT.

00:36:48.239 --> 00:36:51.342
FACILITY.

00:36:51.409 --> 00:36:53.144
I THOUGHT --

00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:53.978
SO WOULD IT THIS GOES.

00:36:54.045 --> 00:36:54.812
TO ALRIGHT SO YOU'RE TALKING

00:36:54.879 --> 00:36:56.747
ABOUT ALL WASTE WATER NOT JUST

00:36:56.814 --> 00:36:58.416
WATER THAT'S RECYCLED.

00:36:58.482 --> 00:37:00.184
I I JUST DON'T SEE IT SO HERE'S

00:37:00.251 --> 00:37:01.385
THE PROBLEM I HAVE THIS IS

00:37:01.452 --> 00:37:03.254
GIVING A TAX EXEMPTION TO

00:37:03.321 --> 00:37:04.088
SOMETHING THAT'S BEING DONE

00:37:04.155 --> 00:37:05.456
ANYWAY.

00:37:05.523 --> 00:37:06.223
AND THEREFORE WHAT IS THE

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:08.025
BENEFIT TO THE STATE OF NOT

00:37:08.092 --> 00:37:09.360
RECEIVING THAT REVENUE I CAN

00:37:09.427 --> 00:37:11.162
UNDERSTAND IF FOR RECYCLED WATER

00:37:11.228 --> 00:37:12.563
MADE.

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:14.365
WE HAVE TO DISCUSS THAT BUT IF

00:37:14.432 --> 00:37:15.366
IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S BEING DONE

00:37:15.433 --> 00:37:17.268
ALREADY.

00:37:17.335 --> 00:37:18.736
AND NOW YOU'RE YOU KNOW IT'S

00:37:18.803 --> 00:37:21.238
REQUIRED PEOPLE PAY FOR IT ON

00:37:21.305 --> 00:37:23.874
THEIR BILLS IT'S NOT A TAX IT'S

00:37:23.941 --> 00:37:26.978
A IT'S A FEE FOR YOU KNOW HAVING

00:37:27.044 --> 00:37:27.745
THAT --

00:37:27.812 --> 00:37:28.679
SEWERS I I JUST DON'T SEE WHY

00:37:28.746 --> 00:37:30.147
THE STATE SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN

00:37:30.214 --> 00:37:31.449
THAT.

00:37:31.515 --> 00:37:35.853
AND BE GIVING A BREAK ON THIS IS

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:37.521
GOING TO AFFECT LOCALITIES

00:37:37.588 --> 00:37:41.592
COUNTIES CITIES AT CETERA WHEN

00:37:41.659 --> 00:37:44.762
YOU SAY THAT THERE'S A SALES TAX

00:37:44.829 --> 00:37:45.930
BREAKS SO IT'S IT'S MUCH.

00:37:45.997 --> 00:37:47.164
AND AGAIN THAT'S GOING TO BE

00:37:47.231 --> 00:37:48.232
MUCH LARGER THE MOUNT OF

00:37:48.299 --> 00:37:50.201
RECYCLED WATER THAT'S DONE IS

00:37:50.267 --> 00:37:53.004
REALLY VERY SMALL COMPARED TO

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:55.573
WASTE WATER.

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:57.274
IF IF WE WE'VE DONE IN THE

00:37:57.341 --> 00:37:58.309
ANALYSIS THAT WE KNOW WE'VE

00:37:58.376 --> 00:37:58.943
ACTUALLY DONE.

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:01.445
A 1% INCREASE IN THE THE

00:38:01.512 --> 00:38:03.714
PERCENTAGE OF RECYCLED WATER.

00:38:03.781 --> 00:38:05.316
WOULD OUTWEIGH THE SAVING ON THE

00:38:05.383 --> 00:38:08.786
COSTS THE TO THAT STATE PROBABLY

00:38:08.853 --> 00:38:09.754
BY ABOUT SIX TO TEN PEOPLE.

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:11.288
SO I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY

00:38:11.355 --> 00:38:12.790
YOU'RE EXEMPTING WASTE WATER IT

00:38:12.857 --> 00:38:13.958
LOOKS TO ME LIKE A SPECIAL

00:38:14.025 --> 00:38:16.527
INTEREST AS OPPOSED TO SOMETHING

00:38:16.594 --> 00:38:19.930
YOU REALLY TRYING TO ENCOURAGE --

00:38:19.997 --> 00:38:20.931
I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT WELL

00:38:20.998 --> 00:38:21.465

00:42:10.928 --> 00:42:12.463
MORE GRAVE.

00:42:12.529 --> 00:42:14.164
ACCORDING TO THE MOST RECENT

00:42:14.231 --> 00:42:15.733

00:42:26.977 --> 00:42:28.879
SO WHAT DO I MEAN IN CALIFORNIA

00:42:28.946 --> 00:42:30.915
PRIOR TO THE GREAT RECESSION

00:42:30.981 --> 00:42:33.851

PROPOSITION.

00:42:45.496 --> 00:42:46.330
NINETY EIGHT COUPLED WITH THAT

00:42:46.397 --> 00:42:47.998
THERE WAS A HUGE CUT IN THE

01:13:05.514 --> 01:13:08.117
ADVANTAGE YES SO MY CONCERN WITH

01:14:06.308 --> 01:14:08.410
PREVIOUS GOVERNOR --

01:14:08.477 --> 01:14:10.312
SO IT PART OF THE REASON WHY I

01:14:10.379 --> 01:14:11.413
HAD BROUGHT THAT UP AT THAT TIME

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:14.082
WAS CITIES LIKE LOS ANGELES WERE

01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:17.352
LOOKING AT OF REQUIRING.

01:14:17.419 --> 01:14:18.554
BUILDING OWNERS TO GO THROUGH

01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:20.322
THE RETROFIT BUT WE'RE NOT

01:14:20.389 --> 01:14:21.824
GIVING THEM ANY RELIEF FOR

01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:24.493
OPTION AND SO THE CONVERSATION

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:25.093
WAS WELL IF THEY'RE GONNA DO

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:26.128
THAT.

01:14:26.195 --> 01:14:27.596
THEY CAN ABSORB ALL THE COST

01:14:27.663 --> 01:14:28.831
EITHER THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

01:14:28.897 --> 01:14:30.199
PASS IT TO THEIR TENANTS.

01:14:30.265 --> 01:14:32.734
SO IF WE DON'T OFFER THE RELIEF

01:14:32.801 --> 01:14:35.604
THAT IS NECESSARY I'M AFRAID

01:14:35.671 --> 01:14:37.406
THAT A LOT OF OUR TENANTS --

01:14:37.472 --> 01:14:39.007
ARE GOING TO BEAR THE BURDEN OF

01:14:39.074 --> 01:14:41.143
THE COST AND THIS IS JUST OUR

01:14:41.210 --> 01:14:42.511
WAY OF TRYING TO HELP.

01:14:42.578 --> 01:14:44.646
OFFER A LITTLE BIT OF RELIEF SO

01:14:44.713 --> 01:14:45.347
THAT.

01:14:45.414 --> 01:14:47.983
BOTH OF OUR TENANTS THE TENANTS

01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:49.251
IN BOTH OF OUR DISTRICTS ALL OF

01:14:49.318 --> 01:14:50.719
OUR DISTRICTS.

01:14:50.786 --> 01:14:53.422
ARE ABLE TO NOT PAY WHAT WOULD

01:14:53.488 --> 01:14:55.023
OF OTHERWHAT WOULD OTHERWISE

01:14:55.090 --> 01:14:56.458
THEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY IF THERE

01:14:56.525 --> 01:14:58.327
WAS NO STATE COMPENSATION OKAY

01:14:58.393 --> 01:14:59.928
SO BASICALLY THIS IS LIKE A

01:14:59.995 --> 01:15:02.965
GRANT PROGRAM FOR RICHER FITS IN

01:15:03.031 --> 01:15:05.467
THE FACT.

01:15:05.534 --> 01:15:06.802
IT'S JUST A NOTED MINISTERED

01:15:06.869 --> 01:15:07.870
THROUGH THE TAXCODE AND THE

01:15:07.936 --> 01:15:09.605
OTHER POINT I WHICH IS EASIER

01:15:09.671 --> 01:15:10.672
THAN A GRANT PROGRAM.

01:15:10.739 --> 01:15:12.040
BEAU BUT THE OTHER POINT I WAS

01:15:12.107 --> 01:15:15.277
GOING TO MAKE ALL SEAHAWKS

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:20.015
POSITION ON THIS ALSO BECAUSE I

01:15:20.082 --> 01:15:22.084
THINK IT'S LIMITING TO SOME

01:15:22.150 --> 01:15:23.719
EXTENT TO JUST SAY THAT.

01:15:23.785 --> 01:15:25.354
IT SHOULD ONLY GO TOWARDS A

01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:27.189
CERTAIN SUBSET OF FOLKS WHO ARE

01:15:27.256 --> 01:15:28.924
WILLING TO MAKE.

01:15:28.991 --> 01:15:31.193
THE THE CHANGES --

01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:33.829
THE DIRECTOR FITS THAT'S WHY IT

01:15:33.896 --> 01:15:35.464
WAS OPEN.

01:15:35.530 --> 01:15:38.934
FOR EVERYONE TO BE ABLE TO APPLY --

01:15:39.001 --> 01:15:40.936
BUT WHAT WILL END UP HAPPENING

01:15:41.003 --> 01:15:43.005
CURRENTLY AT LEAST IS WHOEVER IS

01:15:43.071 --> 01:15:45.474
UNDER REQUIREMENT WILL PROBABLY

01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:47.175
WANT TO GET IN LINE FIRST.

01:15:47.242 --> 01:15:50.178
IF THEY'RE GONNA DO IT --

01:15:50.245 --> 01:15:52.180
I THINK WESHOULD BE LOOKING AT

01:15:52.247 --> 01:15:55.317
OTHER WAYS OF INCENTIVIZING THAT

01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:56.418
COMPLIMENTS.

01:15:56.485 --> 01:15:58.287
POTENTIALLY THIS EFFORT SHOULD

01:15:58.353 --> 01:15:59.888
THIS BILL PASS.

01:15:59.955 --> 01:16:01.890
IN ORDER FOR EVERYONE TO BE ABLE

01:16:01.957 --> 01:16:04.159
TO HAVE ACCESS. TO THE MUCH

01:16:04.226 --> 01:16:05.427
NEEDED DOLLARS BECAUSE WHAT

01:16:05.494 --> 01:16:07.829
EVERY DOLLAR WE INVEST IN NOW.

01:16:07.896 --> 01:16:10.299
IS SAVING QUITE A BIT OF DOLLARS.

01:16:10.365 --> 01:16:11.967
WHEN A DISASTER DOES HAPPEN AND

01:16:12.034 --> 01:16:13.468
WE KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD

01:16:13.535 --> 01:16:15.203
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THAT?

01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:18.206
QUITE A BIT WE'RE WE'RE ARIZONA

01:16:18.273 --> 01:16:19.574
USE THIS AS AN ANECDOTE BUT

01:16:19.641 --> 01:16:22.311
ARIZONA -- A

01:16:22.377 --> 01:16:24.913
YEAR AGO WAS HAVING DRILLS ON

01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:26.882
HOW TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT

01:16:26.949 --> 01:16:27.649
THAT.

01:16:27.716 --> 01:16:30.452
THERE WILL BE FOUR HUNDRED

01:16:30.519 --> 01:16:32.187
THOUSAND CALIFORNIA REFUGEES --

01:16:32.254 --> 01:16:33.689
MOVING TO THE STATE AFTER

01:16:33.755 --> 01:16:35.057
DISPLACEMENT OF A MAJOR

01:16:35.123 --> 01:16:36.658
EARTHQUAKE THEY'RE ALREADY

01:16:36.725 --> 01:16:38.360
MAKING PREPARATIONS FOR THAT.

01:16:38.427 --> 01:16:40.128
SO IF THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING

01:16:40.195 --> 01:16:43.265
AT I THINK THIS IS JUST ONE

01:16:43.332 --> 01:16:44.733
OPTION WE NEED TO LOOK AT

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.935
SEVERAL OTHER OPTIONS AND

01:16:47.002 --> 01:16:48.470
REVOLVING FUNDS POSSIBLY.

01:16:48.537 --> 01:16:51.440
OF OF PROVIDING THIS MUCH NEEDED

01:16:51.506 --> 01:16:53.575
SUPPORT RATHER THAN CURTAILING

01:16:53.642 --> 01:16:54.876
THE OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE I THINK

01:16:54.943 --> 01:16:56.278
SOONER OR LATER.

01:16:56.345 --> 01:16:57.713
MANY MORE JURISDICTIONS ARE

01:16:57.779 --> 01:16:59.715
GOING TO JUMP ON BOARD I THINK

01:16:59.781 --> 01:17:01.650
IF WE KEEP IT OPEN WE'RE HELPING

01:17:01.717 --> 01:17:04.386
INCENTIVIZE MORE FOLKS TO WANT

01:17:04.453 --> 01:17:06.054
TO ACTUALLY PARTICIPATE.

01:17:06.121 --> 01:17:07.789
TO VOLUNTARILY.

01:17:07.856 --> 01:17:09.391
BUT TO BE JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:10.892
THE BILL AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW

01:17:10.959 --> 01:17:12.894
PROVIDES THAT SEISMIC RETROFIT

01:17:12.961 --> 01:17:14.062
CONSTRUCTION DOES NOT INCLUDE

01:17:14.129 --> 01:17:15.897
CONSTRUCTION PERFORMED TO BRING.

01:17:15.964 --> 01:17:17.099
A BUILDING INTO COMPLIANCE WITH

01:17:17.165 --> 01:17:18.700
LOCAL BUILDING CODES SO IT RIGHT

01:17:18.767 --> 01:17:21.069
NOW THE WAY IT READS IT DOES

01:17:21.136 --> 01:17:21.737
READ THAT --

01:17:21.803 --> 01:17:23.405
INCENTIVIZING BUT THIS IS THE

01:17:23.472 --> 01:17:24.573
DIRECTION I BELIEVE AUTHORS

01:17:24.639 --> 01:17:26.908
