00:08:42.655 --> 00:08:44.757
FIRST CENTURY. AND THAT'S-

00:08:44.824 --> 00:08:47.059
IMPORTANT THAT WE KEEP THAT

THE- PARTNERS THAT I WORK WITH.

00:08:58.938 --> 00:09:00.373

00:09:11.617 --> 00:09:12.685
THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR ACES

00:09:12.752 --> 00:09:15.388
IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY THAT WAS

00:09:15.454 --> 00:09:16.389
A- REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF. HOW

00:09:16.455 --> 00:09:18.024
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TOKEEP OUR

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.392
DOORS OPEN NOW BECAUSE OF THAT

00:09:19.458 --> 00:09:20.927
IT RATE INCREASES BUT IN THE

00:09:20.993 --> 00:09:23.296
PAST. THE DO A SMALL INCREASE IN

00:09:23.362 --> 00:09:23.930
FOR OUR STAFF. AND THAT ALLOWED

US TO KEEP OUR DOORS OPEN- FOR

00:09:26.799 --> 00:09:28.200
RIGHT NOW DURING THIS SPECIALLY

00:09:28.267 --> 00:09:32.471
DURING JANUARY. WHEN IT WAS SO

00:09:32.538 --> 00:09:36.609
TOUGH- WE DO HAVE. AS I I'VE

00:09:36.676 --> 00:09:37.610
WORKED WITH ARE OUT TO A

00:09:37.677 --> 00:09:38.844
COMMITTEE ARE TO SAY WE WILL

00:09:38.911 --> 00:09:41.113
NEED TO PAY A WAGE WANTING THE

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:42.782
PAY FOR A STAFF SO THEY CAN DO

00:09:42.848 --> 00:09:44.383
THIS JOB JUST OF HOW LOVE IT BUT

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.485
BECAUSE THEY ARE THEY ARE THEY

00:09:46.552 --> 00:09:48.287
ARE ABLE TO DO IT- OF THE CAN

00:09:48.354 --> 00:09:49.789
ARE PARTNER AGENCIES HAD WAS

00:09:49.855 --> 00:09:51.590
BECAUSE THERE'S NO COLOR BILLS

00:09:51.657 --> 00:09:55.061
AND THE FUNDING IS SEPARATE FROM

00:09:55.127 --> 00:09:56.662
ACES IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY THE

00:09:56.729 --> 00:09:58.164
L. O. P. S. AS SEPARATE THEY'RE

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.967
NOT SURE. IT'S NOT AS NOT AS

00:10:01.033 --> 00:10:03.536
KNOWN AS SMART- IS MORE

00:10:03.602 --> 00:10:05.805
UNCERTAIN HOW ONGOING THAT WILL

00:10:05.871 --> 00:10:06.839
BE AND SO THEY HAVE CONCERNS

00:10:06.906 --> 00:10:08.174
WITH INCREASING THE PAY RATE FOR

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.444
STAFF- WHAT BASE BASED ON THAT

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.213
AND YOU KNOW CALL IT WOULD HELP

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.348
THEM TO FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE.

00:10:15.414 --> 00:10:17.216
BUT ON THAT GOING- THIS ONGOING

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:23.823
COSTS. THEY ALSO MENTIONED THEY

00:10:23.889 --> 00:10:25.858
HAVE THEY HAVE TO GO WITH THE

00:10:25.925 --> 00:10:26.959
DISTRICTS FOR PEACE THEY HAVE TO

00:10:27.026 --> 00:10:29.095
TAKE WHEN I SAID LET'S LET'S PAY

00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:30.496
THEM THEY SAID HOLD ON HAVE TO

00:10:30.563 --> 00:10:32.131
DO THEY HAVE TO DO AGENCIES SO

00:10:32.198 --> 00:10:33.532
THIS HAVE TO GO WITH THE

00:10:33.599 --> 00:10:39.472
DISTRICTS FIGURE OUT. AS OF.

00:10:39.538 --> 00:10:40.406
SAID WE'RE DOING FUNDED WERE

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:41.574
VERY BLAH. HEARING SO WE ALREADY

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.543
HAVE. ENOUGH FOR. BAY TO MEET

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:46.145
THE NEEDS OF OUR ELEMENTARY- SO

00:10:46.212 --> 00:10:47.313
WE ALREADY OPENED TO BILL SCHOOL

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.315
PRO THAT WERE IN NEED OF IF

00:10:49.382 --> 00:10:51.751
PROGRAM. LIKELY A SCHOOL THAT

00:10:51.817 --> 00:10:53.786
WERE SUPPORT JUST SIX LEARNING

00:10:53.853 --> 00:10:55.955
OPPORTUNITY. WAS BENEFICIAL AND

00:10:56.022 --> 00:10:57.123
WE HAVE TWO NEW MIDDLE SCHOOLS

00:10:57.189 --> 00:10:58.691
OPEN AND WE HOPE NEXT YEAR WITH

00:10:58.758 --> 00:10:59.825
THE INCREASE IN FUNDING TO BE

00:10:59.892 --> 00:11:01.761
ABLE TO GO TO HIGH SCHOOL SO I

00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:02.228
REALLY APPRECIATE THE

00:11:02.294 --> 00:11:07.767
FLEXIBILITY OF THE L. O. P. M. I

00:11:07.833 --> 00:11:09.168
DO BUT I DO TO HIGHLIGHT THE

00:11:09.235 --> 00:11:10.669
MOST DISTRICTS DON'T HAVE THE

00:11:10.736 --> 00:11:11.971
SAME AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT WE

00:11:12.038 --> 00:11:14.507
DO SO THEY WILL THEY WILL NEED.

00:11:14.573 --> 00:11:16.842
A DEDICATED FUNDING FOR MIDDLE

00:11:16.909 --> 00:11:18.244
AND HIGH SCHOOL AND I THINK IT'S

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:19.078
REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE

00:11:19.145 --> 00:11:20.813
PROVIDES KIDS THE SERVICES AND

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.782
SUPPORTS ROUTE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

00:11:22.848 --> 00:11:23.849
AND THROUGH MIDDLE SCHOOL AND

00:11:23.916 --> 00:11:25.718
THEN WHEN THEY GET THE HIGH

00:11:25.785 --> 00:11:26.352
SCHOOL WHEN THINGS REALLY START

00:11:26.419 --> 00:11:27.553
TO GET TOUGH FOR THEM OFTENTIMES

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:28.888
WE END UP JUST SAYING OKAY WE'RE

00:11:28.954 --> 00:11:30.056
OUT WE'RE DONE BECAUSE WE DON'T

00:11:30.122 --> 00:11:31.857
HAVE FUNDING FOR THAT SO IT'S

00:11:31.924 --> 00:11:32.858
REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE

00:11:32.925 --> 00:11:33.759
CONTINUE TO SUPPORT STUDENTS ALL

00:11:33.826 --> 00:11:37.530
THE WAY THROUGH- THE- ONE

00:11:37.596 --> 00:11:39.532
CONCERN THAT I HAVE. IS THAT THE

00:11:39.598 --> 00:11:41.367
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IS VITAL IN

00:11:41.434 --> 00:11:42.802

THEY ALREADY HAVE. THE WORK THAT

00:12:06.926 --> 00:12:08.794
THEY'RE DOING AND I JUST WANT TO

00:12:08.861 --> 00:12:09.829

BUILD THE TRUST THAT WE'VE-

00:12:28.981 --> 00:12:29.915
DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN

00:12:29.982 --> 00:12:33.552
YEARS- WHEN WE- ONE OF THE

00:12:33.619 --> 00:12:34.687

YELLOW P. FUNDING ALLOWS IT. IS

00:14:05.544 --> 00:14:08.347
VITAL- THE OTHER THING THAT I DO

00:14:08.414 --> 00:14:09.915
WANT TO. BRING UP IS OUR SUMMER

00:14:09.982 --> 00:14:11.217
OUR SUMMER PROGRAM SO WE'VE

00:14:11.283 --> 00:14:12.651
BEEN. WE'VE HAD A VERY STRONG

00:14:12.718 --> 00:14:14.954
SUMMER PROGRAM FOR YEARS. AND

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.088
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

00:14:16.155 --> 00:14:17.823
LEARNED LAST SUMMER WAS. HOW

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:20.259
IMPORTANT IT IS TO HAVE.

00:14:20.326 --> 00:14:22.795
COHESIVE SOLID PROGRAM. WHERE

00:14:22.861 --> 00:14:24.263
THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF THE L. O.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.065
G. FUNDING WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE

00:14:26.131 --> 00:14:27.266
TEACHERS CUSHION INTO

00:14:27.333 --> 00:14:28.434
INTERVENTION AND THEY WERE

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.668
REALLY ABLE TO FOCUS ON SMALL

00:14:29.735 --> 00:14:31.136
GROUP INTERVENTION THE TEACHERS

00:14:31.203 --> 00:14:32.871
LOVED IT. ABSOLUTELY LOVED

00:14:32.938 --> 00:14:34.006
TEACHING SUMMER BECAUSE THEY

00:14:34.073 --> 00:14:34.773
DIDN'T HAVE TO RUN THE WHOLE

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.208
CLASSROOM ARE STUFF FREE WILL TO

00:14:36.275 --> 00:14:37.843
DO THAT AND ALL THEY HAD TO DO

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:38.978
WAS. TO THE INTERVENTION.

00:14:39.044 --> 00:14:41.280
COMPONENTS AND THEY LOVED IT IT.

00:14:41.347 --> 00:14:43.048
WAS REALLY POWERFUL IT MADE FOR

00:14:43.115 --> 00:14:45.217
A CONSISTENT COHESIVE DAY FOR

00:14:45.284 --> 00:14:48.554
THE STUDENTS- AND MY CONCERN

00:14:48.621 --> 00:14:50.522
WITH THE NINE HOURS FOR SUMMER

00:14:50.589 --> 00:14:52.258
IS THAT IT WILL FORCE SCHOOL

00:14:52.324 --> 00:14:53.425
DISTRICTS WHO'VE NEVER DONE THIS

00:14:53.492 --> 00:14:54.760
BEFORE THE HOUSE LIKE THREE

00:14:54.827 --> 00:14:56.161
HOURS IN THE MORNING OF A SCHOOL

00:14:56.228 --> 00:14:57.663
AND SIX HOURS OF AFTER SCHOOL

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:59.565
AND THEN YOU HAVE A SEPARATE

00:14:59.632 --> 00:15:00.165
PROGRAM AND THAT REALLY ISN'T

00:15:00.232 --> 00:15:03.168
THE HIGHEST THE BEST. MODEL SO

00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:05.004
FROM US I WOULD LOVE IT IF THERE

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:07.039
WAS FLEXIBILITY FOR LIKE A SEVEN

00:15:07.106 --> 00:15:08.707
TO NINE HOURS A DAY OR INSTEAD

00:15:08.774 --> 00:15:10.476
OF SPECIFIC HOURS MAYBE IT'S YOU

00:15:10.542 --> 00:15:13.512
KNOW RANGE OF TWO HUNDRED HOURS-

00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:14.680
OR SOMETHING FOR THE SUMMER SO

00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:16.248
THAT SO THAT DISTRICTS SO MAYBE

00:15:16.315 --> 00:15:17.583
AT LEAST FOR THE FIRST FEW YEARS

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:18.550
AS DISTRICTS ARE TRYING TO

00:15:18.617 --> 00:15:19.652
FIGURE OUT HOW TO BUILD THESE

00:15:19.718 --> 00:15:21.086
RELATIONSHIPS AND BUILD THESE

00:15:21.153 --> 00:15:22.087
CONNECTIONS SO THAT THEY CAN

00:15:22.154 --> 00:15:24.456
HAVE REALLY FOCUS ON THE QUALITY

00:15:24.523 --> 00:15:26.358
I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS

00:15:26.425 --> 00:15:30.462
I'M MOST GRATEFUL FOR THAT. THE

00:15:30.529 --> 00:15:32.865
SYSTEMS I'M SUPER FIRST. LINE IS

00:15:32.931 --> 00:15:34.800
THE CALL STANDARDS QUALITY. AND

00:15:34.867 --> 00:15:35.901
COULD VERY CLEARLY SPELL OUT

00:15:35.968 --> 00:15:37.369
THIS IS WHY A QUALITY. LOOK LIKE

00:15:37.436 --> 00:15:40.406
THIS IS HOW YOU DO IT. THIS IS

00:15:40.472 --> 00:15:41.874
YOU KNOW WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:44.376
SO I REALLY. WANT TO EMPHASIZE

00:15:44.443 --> 00:15:46.312
THAT THAT I WILL CONSIDER MY

00:15:46.378 --> 00:15:47.112
CONCERN IS HELPING TRYING TO

00:15:47.179 --> 00:15:48.113
MAKE A NINE HOUR I UNDERSTAND

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:49.615
THAT FOR FAMILIES THEY NEED THAT

00:15:49.682 --> 00:15:51.183
I UNDERSTAND THAT AN ASPEN

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:53.018
SCHOOL YEAR THAT MAKES SENSE.

00:15:53.085 --> 00:15:54.086
AND FOR SUMMER AT LEAST WE'RE

00:15:54.153 --> 00:15:55.287
GETTING UP AND RUNNING I THINK

00:15:55.354 --> 00:15:56.822
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE.

00:15:56.889 --> 00:15:58.757
SOME FLEXIBILITY THERE FOR THAT

00:15:58.824 --> 00:16:02.561
DISTRICTS CAN REALLY- POCUS ON

00:16:02.628 --> 00:16:04.029
THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. AND

00:16:04.096 --> 00:16:06.065

00:38:27.238 --> 00:38:28.572

THAT EXPECTATION. IS THE

00:38:52.296 --> 00:38:53.698
EXPECTATION IS THAT THE KIND OF

00:38:53.764 --> 00:38:54.699
THE MOST STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS

00:38:54.765 --> 00:38:55.900

SEVERAL MONTHS BECAUSE- THERE

00:39:24.895 --> 00:39:25.963
ARE SOME FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:29.967
BETWEEN THE EXPANDED LEARNING-OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM. IT IS A

00:39:30.034 --> 00:39:31.802
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. ONE OF THE

00:39:31.869 --> 00:39:34.338
FIRST IS THAT ACES IN TWENTY

FUNDING ANY STUDENT IN ANY

SCHOOL CAN ATTEND THE PROGRAM IN

00:39:53.691 --> 00:39:56.594
THAT DISTRICT. THE ELO PROGRAM.

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:57.928
EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES

00:39:57.995 --> 00:40:00.598
PROGRAM FUNDING IS TO AN ALLEY A

00:40:00.664 --> 00:40:02.366
AND THE CHOICE OF WHAT SCHOOLS

00:40:02.433 --> 00:40:04.602
RECEIVE THE FUNDING IS THE LOCAL

00:40:04.668 --> 00:40:06.337
CHOICE IN THE L. E. EIGHT. THE

00:40:06.403 --> 00:40:08.072
ELLIE A CAN OF COURSE YOU CAN

00:40:08.139 --> 00:40:10.708
CHOOSE. TO PARTNER WITH AN

00:40:10.775 --> 00:40:12.009
OUTSIDE AGENCY AND RUN THE

00:40:12.076 --> 00:40:14.578
PROGRAM OFF SITE. WERE SEEN SOME

00:40:14.645 --> 00:40:16.914
DISTRICTS WHO ARE CHOOSING TO

00:40:16.981 --> 00:40:18.315
PARTNER WITH THEIR LOCAL PARKS

00:40:18.382 --> 00:40:20.851
AND RECREATION PROGRAM BECAUSE

00:40:20.918 --> 00:40:22.319
IT THEIR FACILITIES AND THEIR

00:40:22.386 --> 00:40:25.956
STAFF ARE LOTS OF CREATIVE.

00:40:26.023 --> 00:40:27.858
APPROACHES TO THIS. ONE OF THE

00:40:27.925 --> 00:40:31.328
MOST COMMON- MISCONCEPTIONS IS

00:40:31.395 --> 00:40:34.565
THAT THE LEGISLATION FOR THE

00:40:34.632 --> 00:40:36.100
EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES

00:40:36.167 --> 00:40:38.435
PROGRAM STATES THAT ATTENDANCE

00:40:38.502 --> 00:40:40.805
IS BASED ON THE NEEDS OF THE

00:40:40.871 --> 00:40:42.840
STUDENT IN THE FAMILY THE

00:40:42.907 --> 00:40:44.975
PROGRAM HAS TO BE OFFERED. AT

00:40:45.042 --> 00:40:47.244
ACCESS HAS TO BE PROVIDED BUT

00:40:47.311 --> 00:40:48.546
THE ATTENDANCE REQUIREMENTS ARE

00:40:48.612 --> 00:40:51.949
BASED ON THE NEED TO THIS. IT

00:40:52.016 --> 00:40:53.818
ACES IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY THE

00:40:53.884 --> 00:40:56.487
AT CODE SAYS IT IS THE INTENT OF

00:40:56.554 --> 00:40:57.087
THE LEGISLATURE THAT STUDENTS

00:40:57.154 --> 00:40:59.356
ATTEND DALY. HOWEVER THAT IS NOT

00:40:59.423 --> 00:41:00.457
A REQUIREMENT THE ACTUAL

00:41:00.524 --> 00:41:02.092
REQUIREMENT FOR ACES IN TWENTY

00:41:02.159 --> 00:41:04.862
FIRST CENTURY. IS THAT ELEAZAR

00:41:04.929 --> 00:41:06.063
ESTABLISHED THEIR OWN ATTENDANCE

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:07.631
POLICY IN THEIR OWN EARLY

00:41:07.698 --> 00:41:09.500
RELEASE POLICY. IT WOULDN'T

00:41:09.567 --> 00:41:11.402
AUDITOR COMES THERE SIMPLY

00:41:11.468 --> 00:41:12.770
CHECKING TO SEE IF THEY'RE

00:41:12.837 --> 00:41:14.605
FOLLOWING THEIR OWN POLICY. THE

00:41:14.672 --> 00:41:16.707
REASON THAT SIGNIFICANT IS

00:41:16.774 --> 00:41:18.776
BECAUSE WHAT HAS COME UP. MOST

00:41:18.843 --> 00:41:20.778
PROMINENTLY IS A CONCERN. FOR

00:41:20.845 --> 00:41:22.046
ELEAZAR OVER THE LAST COUPLE

00:41:22.112 --> 00:41:25.049
MONTHS- IT HAS WELL OVER THE

00:41:25.115 --> 00:41:27.384
LAST YEAR AS THIS IS THE FIRST

00:41:27.451 --> 00:41:29.486
YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION IS HOW

00:41:29.553 --> 00:41:30.788
CAN THESE HOW CAN THIS BECOME

00:41:30.855 --> 00:41:32.189
ONE COMPANY CAN HAVE ONE

00:41:32.256 --> 00:41:34.358
COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM. BECAUSE

00:41:34.425 --> 00:41:35.960
STUDENTS HAVE TO ATTEND EVERY

00:41:36.026 --> 00:41:36.961
DAY FOR A SYSTEM TWENTY FIRST

00:41:37.027 --> 00:41:40.231
CENTURY BUT NOT IN A LOW P. AND

00:41:40.297 --> 00:41:41.265
SO WE'RE HELPING. DISTRICTS

00:41:41.332 --> 00:41:43.067
UNDERSTAND THAT THE MENTAL

00:41:43.133 --> 00:41:44.735
MODELS A WAY OF THINKING ABOUT

00:41:44.802 --> 00:41:46.837
ACES THEY CAN DESIGN AND THE

00:41:46.904 --> 00:41:48.873
TENANTS OF EARLY RELEASE POLICY

00:41:48.939 --> 00:41:51.742
THAT GIVES THEM THE FLEXIBILITY

00:41:51.809 --> 00:41:53.878
TO ALIGN THIS. AND WE STILL HAVE

00:41:53.944 --> 00:41:56.447
DISTRICTS TALKING ABOUT TWELVE.

00:41:56.513 --> 00:41:58.115
WHAT IF A STUDENT CHOOSES THE L.

00:41:58.182 --> 00:41:59.583
O. PROGRAM INSTEAD OF THE ASUS

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:01.385
PROGRAM WOULD WORK WERE REALLY

00:42:01.452 --> 00:42:03.120
ENCOURAGING DISTRICTS TO THINK

00:42:03.187 --> 00:42:05.522
ABOUT THIS. AS DIFFERENT FUNDING

00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:08.158
STREAMS TO SUPPORT A SINGLE

00:42:08.225 --> 00:42:10.628
PROGRAM M. AMANDA YOU AND I'VE

00:42:10.694 --> 00:42:12.463
TALKED ABOUT THIS A LOT YOU'RE

00:42:12.529 --> 00:42:16.934
DOING THAT IN GILROY- WHAT WE'VE

00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:19.503
TRADITIONALLY DONE IN EDUCATION

00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:21.939
. IS MADE SURE THE PROGRAMS WERE

00:42:22.006 --> 00:42:23.774
SILENT IF IT'S A DIFFERENT

00:42:23.841 --> 00:42:25.376
FUNDING SOURCES THEN THE

00:42:25.442 --> 00:42:26.810
CHILDREN CAN'T MIX BECAUSE

00:42:26.877 --> 00:42:27.978
THERE'S DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS

00:42:28.045 --> 00:42:29.446
I'VE SEEN THIS IN THE TWENTY

00:42:29.513 --> 00:42:31.181
YEARS AROUND THESE PROGRAMS IN

00:42:31.248 --> 00:42:33.083
THE BAY AREA THE BAY AREA. YOU

00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:34.785
HAVE A PROGRAM FUNDED FOR SCHOOL

00:42:34.852 --> 00:42:35.853
AGE CARE ON THIS SIDE OF THE

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:37.521
CAMPUS A PROGRAM FOR ACES ON THE

00:42:37.588 --> 00:42:39.356
SIDE OF THE CAMPUS AND MAY BE A

00:49:43.613 --> 00:49:45.682
NOT GONNA HAPPEN. SO BUT WE'RE

IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY JUST

00:53:15.325 --> 00:53:17.260
BECAUSE OF STAFFING RATIOS AND

00:53:17.327 --> 00:53:20.130

EDUCATION SO- THE DISTRICTS THAT

00:53:35.545 --> 00:53:36.379
DON'T HAVE BASES IN TWENTY FIRST

00:53:36.446 --> 00:53:38.515

00:53:38.582 --> 00:53:42.052
OF FUNDING. ARTIST PRINCES TO

00:53:42.118 --> 00:53:47.057

00:53:55.131 --> 00:53:56.967
WANT DISTRICTS TO THINK

00:53:57.033 --> 00:53:58.835
HOLISTICALLY WITH THIS FUNDING

00:53:58.902 --> 00:54:01.671
AND NOT THINK ABOUT HOW TO JUST

00:54:01.738 --> 00:54:03.940

INSTRUCTIONAL DAY. BUT THAT. A

00:54:20.924 --> 00:54:22.359

LEARNING DURING THAT ENTIRE TIME

00:54:30.467 --> 00:54:31.368
. AND THEN USING ANY FUNDING

00:54:31.434 --> 00:54:34.104
SOURCE COMBINED WITH THE L. O.

00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:36.506

JUST I QUESTION IS IF THE GOAL

00:56:03.893 --> 00:56:07.397
HERE IS TO THINK OF YOU UP AS AN

00:56:07.464 --> 00:56:09.399
ADDITIONAL FUNDING SOURCE- WHY

00:56:09.466 --> 00:56:11.668
NOT JUST PUT IN THE ACES. AND

00:56:11.735 --> 00:56:14.304
DIRECTED TO THE PARTICULAR GOALS

00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:15.305
OF EXPANDING LEARNING AND

00:56:15.371 --> 00:56:17.273
LEARNING LOSS AS OPPOSED TO

00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:18.475
CREATING A STANDALONE PROGRAM

00:56:18.541 --> 00:56:19.743
WHICH YOU KNOW IF IT'S JUST A

00:56:19.809 --> 00:56:21.911
DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES. I CAN

00:56:21.978 --> 00:56:23.680
UNDERSTAND THAT BUT BUT I GUESS-

00:56:23.747 --> 00:56:25.148
AND MAYBE THIS GOES THE

00:56:25.215 --> 00:56:25.782
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHAT'S THE

00:56:25.849 --> 00:56:27.984
IMPETUS FOR. MAKING A BRAND NEW

00:56:28.051 --> 00:56:30.520
PROGRAM THAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S

00:56:30.587 --> 00:56:31.521
GOING TO HAVE ITS OWN

00:56:31.588 --> 00:56:32.388
REQUIREMENTS LOOKS LIKE IT'S

00:56:32.455 --> 00:56:32.989
GOING TO HAVE MORE

00:56:33.056 --> 00:56:35.091
ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS- YOU KNOW

00:56:35.158 --> 00:56:36.926

00:56:44.267 --> 00:56:46.202
THAT. ADDITIONAL FUNDING SOURCE

CENTER AREA. BERMAN FINANCE

00:56:50.039 --> 00:56:52.175
WARNINGS- I'LL TAKE A STAB AT

00:56:52.242 --> 00:56:54.110
THAT. MANSER DOT QUESTIONS I

00:56:54.177 --> 00:56:57.881
THINK THERE'S- A FEW REASONS ONE

00:56:57.947 --> 00:57:02.318
IS THAT- BASIS PROGRAM SETTLERS

00:57:02.385 --> 00:57:03.153
RIGHT WITH PROP THREE NINE THREE

00:57:03.219 --> 00:57:04.821
YEARS AGO- THE SORCERER

00:57:04.888 --> 00:57:07.924
MINISTRATION AND IT HAS A LOT OF

00:57:07.991 --> 00:57:09.692
THOSE A LOT OF THE IMPLEMENTING.

00:57:09.759 --> 00:57:11.594
YOU KNOW DESIGN OF THAT PROGRAM

00:57:11.661 --> 00:57:13.630
YES CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT AS A

00:57:13.696 --> 00:57:14.864
RESULT OF IT BEING A BALLOT

00:57:14.931 --> 00:57:17.700
INITIATIVE. AND SO THE ABILITY

00:57:17.767 --> 00:57:19.002
ON THE PART OF THE

00:57:19.068 --> 00:57:20.503
ADMINISTRATION OR EVENTHAT THE

00:57:20.570 --> 00:57:22.806
LEGISLATURE RIGHT ALTERNATELY.

00:57:22.872 --> 00:57:23.907
TO A MAN SOME OF THOSE

00:57:23.973 --> 00:57:28.912
PROVISIONS SOME OF THAT DESIGN-

00:57:28.978 --> 00:57:29.546
IS VERY LIMITED BECAUSE OF THAT.

00:57:29.612 --> 00:57:31.748
SO I THINK THAT'S ONE. I ANOTHER

00:57:31.815 --> 00:57:34.918
THING IS ALSO INHERENT WITHIN

00:57:34.984 --> 00:57:36.186
BACK PROVISION OR EXCUSE ME

00:57:36.252 --> 00:57:39.856
WITHIN THAT- THE PROPOSITION.

00:57:39.923 --> 00:57:42.826
MONTH THAT ESTABLISH A- ARE SO

00:57:42.892 --> 00:57:44.260
REQUIRED AROUND IF ADDITION

00:57:44.327 --> 00:57:47.831
FUNDING FROM. FOR A SAYS VAN

00:57:47.897 --> 00:57:50.466
UNDER THE- THE PROVISIONS OF THE

00:57:50.533 --> 00:57:52.268
ORIGINAL PROPOSITION THEN THERE

00:57:52.335 --> 00:57:54.170
IS A REQUIREMENT AS WELL TO

00:57:54.237 --> 00:57:56.406
INCREASE THE GUARANTEE. PURPOSES

00:57:56.472 --> 00:57:58.041
NINETY MINIMUM GUARANTEED BY THE

00:57:58.107 --> 00:58:00.577
SAME AMOUNT OF FUNDING MR REDDY

00:58:00.643 --> 00:58:02.645
MISTRETTA **** JUST INTERRUPT

00:58:02.712 --> 00:58:04.547
FOR SECOND I THINK. MAYBE THERE

00:58:04.614 --> 00:58:06.349
WAS A DISCONNECT THERE BECAUSE I

00:58:06.416 --> 00:58:08.885
THINK THERE'S THE MINIMUM IN THE

00:58:08.952 --> 00:58:10.353
THAT WAS CREATED BY THE BALLOT

00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:11.287
MEASURE BUT I THINK SENATOR

00:58:11.354 --> 00:58:13.323
MINUTES ASKING IF FROM GENERAL

00:58:13.389 --> 00:58:14.791
FUND RATHER SOURCES YOU COULD

00:58:14.858 --> 00:58:16.860
ADD TO IT YEAH WHAT I GUESS THE

00:58:16.926 --> 00:58:18.394
QUESTION REALLY IS WE'RE TALKING

00:58:18.461 --> 00:58:20.029
A SIGNIFICANT BUDGET OUTLAY HERE

00:58:20.096 --> 00:58:21.798
FOR THE EVIL THAT EXPANDED

00:58:21.865 --> 00:58:23.266
LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM A

00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:25.902
QUALITY LAW OFFICES FASTER BUT-

00:58:25.969 --> 00:58:27.337
WE COULD DIRECT THAT MONEY AND I

00:58:27.403 --> 00:58:28.571
DON'T. IT WHAT WITH WITH THEIR

00:58:28.638 --> 00:58:29.973
BE CONSTITUTIONAL RESTRICTIONS

00:58:30.039 --> 00:58:31.941
ON US AS A LEGISLATURE DIRECTING

00:58:32.008 --> 00:58:33.810
THAT MONEY TO THE SAME PLACES

00:58:33.877 --> 00:58:34.844
THAT ALREADY RECEIVE ASUS

00:58:34.911 --> 00:58:36.613
FUNDING AND WITHOUT TAMPERING

00:58:36.679 --> 00:58:38.248
WITH THIRD IT YOU KNOW-

00:58:38.314 --> 00:58:39.249
INTERFERING WITH THE BALLOT

00:58:39.315 --> 00:58:40.950
MEASURE AND I GUESS MY QUESTION

00:58:41.017 --> 00:58:41.751
IS WOULDN'T THAT BE MORE

00:58:41.818 --> 00:58:44.053
EFFICIENT POTENTIALLY. AND GET

00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:45.922
RID OF SOME OF THE CONFUSION OR

00:58:45.989 --> 00:58:50.493
DONE AND SEE. THAT YOU GET WHEN

00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:51.794
YOU CREATE RENDON PROGRAM-

00:58:51.861 --> 00:58:54.230
CERTAINLY THINK IT'S- POSSIBLE

00:58:54.297 --> 00:58:55.698
THAT THERE COULD PERHAPS BE

00:58:55.765 --> 00:58:58.167
SOMETHING. IMPLEMENTATION OF

00:58:58.234 --> 00:58:58.868
COULD HAVE BEEN SOME

00:58:58.935 --> 00:59:00.303
INTIMIDATION BENEFITS SO THAT

00:59:00.370 --> 00:59:01.938
APPROACH I DON'T KNOW A PERSON I

00:59:02.005 --> 00:59:03.273
DON'T KNOW THE ASUS PROGRAM

00:59:03.339 --> 00:59:05.441
MYSELF PERSONALLY. WELL ENOUGH

00:59:05.508 --> 00:59:06.876
TO REALLY SAY ONE WAY OR ANOTHER

00:59:06.943 --> 00:59:09.112
A 100% FOR CERTAIN- I WOULD

00:59:09.178 --> 00:59:10.980
MENTION AGAIN THE LIKE I WAS

00:59:11.047 --> 00:59:12.215
GETTING TO WITH. MY POINT ABOUT

00:59:12.282 --> 00:59:14.350
THE NINETY EIGHT THE BOSTON

00:59:14.417 --> 00:59:15.451
NINETY GUARANTEE CALCULATION IS

00:59:15.518 --> 00:59:16.819
THAT ANY FUNDING THAT WERE TO BE

00:59:16.886 --> 00:59:18.721
PROVIDED BY THE LEGISLATURE.

00:59:18.788 --> 00:59:21.424
ABOVE THAT- INITIAL AMOUNT DOES

00:59:21.491 --> 00:59:23.693
REQUIRE- PURSUANT TO THAT

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:25.762
PROPOSITION AND INCREASE OR OR

00:59:25.828 --> 00:59:27.997
RE BENCH. OF THE PROJECT NINETY

00:59:28.064 --> 00:59:29.899
NANOMETER ANTIVIRAL I COME OUT

00:59:29.966 --> 00:59:31.768
AND SO IT DOES EXPOSE THE STATE-

00:59:31.834 --> 00:59:33.102
AND THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BUDGET

00:59:33.169 --> 00:59:34.637
RIGHT THE NONPARTISAN NINETY

00:59:34.704 --> 00:59:37.206
SEVEN. TO TWO- KIND OF A

00:59:37.273 --> 00:59:38.308
DECREASE IN AVAILABLE GENERAL

00:59:38.374 --> 00:59:40.209
FUND FOR THE NON NINETY SEVEN

00:59:40.276 --> 00:59:42.378
BUDGET BY A LIKE AMOUNT SO NICE.

00:59:42.445 --> 00:59:45.148
MISTER READY- LET ME TRY IT.

00:59:45.214 --> 00:59:46.115
AGAIN AND IT MAY BE A DIFFERENT

00:59:46.182 --> 00:59:49.652
WAY. IF WE WANTED TO ADD MONEY

00:59:49.719 --> 00:59:51.521
IS THERE A WAY TO DO IT THAT

00:59:51.587 --> 00:59:55.758
DOESN'T. CREATE ALL THOSE

00:59:55.825 --> 00:59:58.461
PROBLEMS. I AM NOT AWARE OF THE

00:59:58.528 --> 01:00:01.064
WAY. SENATOR CAN I TEACH ME

01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:03.900
ASSURE CAN I TAKE A- STAB OF

01:00:03.967 --> 01:00:07.437
COURSE YOU CAN. JONES SAWYER OF

01:00:07.503 --> 01:00:09.172
COURSE YOU CAN THERE'S ALREADY

01:00:09.238 --> 01:00:09.973
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND

01:00:10.039 --> 01:00:14.210
FINANCE ON. ON E. P. AN EAGLE UP

01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:17.647
LET'S SEE IF IT EXPANDS HERE.

01:00:17.714 --> 01:00:21.050
ACES THREE RED COAT IS A

01:00:21.117 --> 01:00:22.819
COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM. THAT

01:00:22.885 --> 01:00:30.326
HAS. MANY DIFFERENT- PRESCRIBED

01:00:30.393 --> 01:00:31.861
ACTIVITIES FOR THE DEPARTMENT

01:00:31.928 --> 01:00:33.997
AND FOR ELEAZAR TO APPLY FOR TO

01:00:34.063 --> 01:00:37.967
ACCOUNT FOR. AS I DESCRIBED IT

01:00:38.034 --> 01:00:41.771
SPECIFICALLY ALLOCATES A GRANT

01:00:41.838 --> 01:00:44.340
TO A SPECIFIC SCHOOL SITES. THE

01:00:44.407 --> 01:00:47.610
L. O. PROGRAM IS IN A SENSE THIS

01:00:47.677 --> 01:00:48.611
MONEY GOES OUT AS AN

01:00:48.678 --> 01:00:50.546
APPORTIONMENT. IT'S ACTUALLY

01:00:50.613 --> 01:00:53.683
LESS BURDENSOME. TO ADMINISTER

01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:56.586
M. FOR ELEAZAR ELLIE IS GOING TO

01:00:56.652 --> 01:00:59.222
REALLY FOCUS ON. WHAT KIND OF

01:00:59.288 --> 01:01:01.024
WORK PLAN ARE WE GOING TO PUT

01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:02.125
TOGETHER WHAT KIND OF DESIGNER

01:01:02.191 --> 01:01:04.327
WE CAN AND- CREATE AND HOW DO WE

01:01:04.394 --> 01:01:06.362
IMPLEMENT THIS. PERSON'S GOING

01:01:06.429 --> 01:01:08.297
THROUGH THE PROCESS. OF WRITING

01:01:08.364 --> 01:01:10.767
AN APPLICATION. SUBMITTED TO THE

DEPARTMENT WAITED MONTHS FOR

01:01:13.136 --> 01:01:15.538
PETITIONS SO I THINK. ONE OF THE

01:01:15.605 --> 01:01:17.407
FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES IS THAT

01:01:17.473 --> 01:01:19.409
YELLOW PROGRAM FUNDING AS AN

01:01:19.475 --> 01:01:21.577
APPORTIONMENT. GIVES DISTRICTS

01:01:21.644 --> 01:01:24.547
MORE FLEXIBILITY THAN ACES IN

01:01:24.614 --> 01:01:25.415
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY FUNDING

01:01:25.481 --> 01:01:27.650
DOES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF

01:01:27.717 --> 01:01:30.086
STUDENTS AND FAMILIES THAT ARE

01:01:30.153 --> 01:01:36.426

WANNA MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND THE

01:01:47.303 --> 01:01:49.072
PROGRAMS- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT.

01:01:49.138 --> 01:01:50.540
THESE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS I

01:01:50.606 --> 01:01:51.741
ASSUME THERE ARE STRINGS

01:01:51.808 --> 01:01:52.608
ATTACHED IN THERE SOME KIND OF

01:01:52.675 --> 01:01:54.811
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND

01:01:54.877 --> 01:01:57.313
WHATNOT- ARE THE STREAMLINED

01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:00.516
LIKE SO IF AS WE GO BACK TO THE

01:02:00.583 --> 01:02:01.317
SORT OF THE ORIGINAL.

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:03.119
PROPOSITION HERE THAT

01:02:03.186 --> 01:02:04.554
DISTRIBUTION IS DIFFERENT

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:06.456
FUNDING SOURCES AND AS WE WOULD

01:02:06.522 --> 01:02:08.357
IDEALLY LIKE TO SEE A SCHOOL DO.

01:02:08.424 --> 01:02:10.893
ALL THREE OF ASUS TWENTY FIRST

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:11.861
CENTURY COMMUNITIES LESS

01:02:11.928 --> 01:02:13.963
LEARNING CENTERS AND- EXPANDING

01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:16.566
LEARNING OPPORTUNITY. PROGRAMS

01:02:16.632 --> 01:02:18.267
AND RECEIVE ALL THREE SOURCES OF

01:02:18.334 --> 01:02:20.236
FUNDING. WOULD THAT CREATE.

01:02:20.303 --> 01:02:22.405
ADDITIONAL REPORTING IN OR

01:02:22.472 --> 01:02:24.540

PARTICULAR SCHOOL OR ARE THEY

01:02:28.678 --> 01:02:30.413
BASICALLY HARMONIZED SO THAT.

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.248
ARE THE ADDITION OF SET YOU OFF

01:02:32.315 --> 01:02:33.516
FUNDING DOESN'T CREATE ANY

01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:34.851
ADDITIONAL REPORTING

01:02:34.917 --> 01:02:36.652
REQUIREMENTS. THAT MAKES SENSE

01:02:36.719 --> 01:02:40.990
AND I COULD BE FOR A OR- FINANCE

THE EXPAND LEARNING

01:02:58.007 --> 01:02:58.608
OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM IS

01:02:58.674 --> 01:03:01.611
CONCERNED- THERE IS NOT A LOT

01:03:01.677 --> 01:03:03.479
OF- EXTENSIVE REPORTING

01:03:03.546 --> 01:03:04.914

WHAT THERE IS IN THERE- AS WAS

01:03:09.652 --> 01:03:11.220
MENTIONED BY MY COLLEAGUE LENA

01:03:11.287 --> 01:03:13.523
GRANT IN HER PRESENTATION. IS

01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:15.291
THE PROPOSAL OF SOME ON IT

AND WE ARE PROPOSING TO HAVE

01:03:20.696 --> 01:03:22.698
SOME REVISIONS TO THOSE- SO

01:03:22.765 --> 01:03:23.666
THAT'S MORE PROPORTIONATE

01:03:23.733 --> 01:03:25.868
PENALTY NOT YOU KNOW WHAT OKAY.

01:03:25.935 --> 01:03:27.837

REQUIREMENT IT'S KIND OF JUST

01:03:30.406 --> 01:03:31.407
BACK IN ACCOUNTABILITY ON THE

01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:33.242
ANNUAL AUDIT LIKE WE HAVE FOR A

01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:35.778
LOT OF PROGRAMS RIGHT- SO I

01:03:35.845 --> 01:03:37.547
COULDN'T AND I UNFORTUNATELY GOT

01:03:37.613 --> 01:03:38.648
I DON'T HAVE AS MUCHEXPERTISE

01:03:38.714 --> 01:03:40.283
WHEN IT COMES TO ASUS OR SOME OF

01:03:40.349 --> 01:03:42.518
THESE OTHER. SIMILAR PROGRAMS SO

01:03:42.585 --> 01:03:43.719
MADE APARTMENT THAT COULD SPEAK

01:03:43.786 --> 01:03:45.821
IN ON THAT REGARD IN TERMS OF

01:03:45.888 --> 01:03:46.923
REPORTING BURDENS ON AN ALLEY

01:03:46.989 --> 01:03:49.492
ANY- BUT CERTAINLY LIKE MICHAEL

01:03:49.559 --> 01:03:50.826
IT TO EARLIER WE HAVE BEEN

01:03:50.893 --> 01:03:53.062
HAVING CONVERSATIONS IN IN THE-

01:03:53.129 --> 01:03:54.297
SEVERAL MONTHS FROM THE

01:03:54.363 --> 01:03:56.699
ENACTMENT IN JUNE. SALAS THE

01:03:56.766 --> 01:03:58.534
PROGRAM ABOUT WAYS THAT WE MIGHT

01:03:58.601 --> 01:03:59.535
BE ABLE TO STREAMLINE THINGS

01:03:59.602 --> 01:04:01.504
STILL CHEAT THE GOALS OF THE

01:04:01.571 --> 01:04:03.139
PROGRAM- BUT PERHAPS STREAMLINE

01:04:03.206 --> 01:04:04.173
THINGS FOR AT LEAST THE EXTENT

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:05.975
POSSIBLE AND CERTAINLY THOSE

01:04:06.042 --> 01:04:07.343
CONVERSATIONS ARE STILL ONGOING

01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:12.982

01:04:14.083 --> 01:04:14.984
THE THINGS. NOT A THANK YOU

01:04:15.051 --> 01:04:18.854
CENTER. ONE MARK- SO I THINK YOU

01:04:18.921 --> 01:04:20.256
SAW OF STARTED ANSWERING THIS IN

01:04:20.323 --> 01:04:21.724
RESPONSE TO SOME OTHER. BUT I

01:04:21.791 --> 01:04:22.825
JUST WANTED TO LIKE GET A CLEAR

01:04:22.892 --> 01:04:25.094
ANSWER. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT-

01:04:25.161 --> 01:04:28.364
EXPANDED THE EVA PROGRAM. THE

01:04:28.431 --> 01:04:29.732
WAY I THINK ABOUT IT AFTER

01:04:29.799 --> 01:04:30.833
HEARING SOME OF YOUR ANSWERS IS

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:32.401
THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE. SOME

01:04:32.468 --> 01:04:33.903
CHALLENGES WHEN IT COMES TO.

01:04:33.970 --> 01:04:35.571
IMPLEMENTING THIS. IN SCHOOLS

01:04:35.638 --> 01:04:37.573
THAT ALREADY HAVE ACES AND OR

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:39.475
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY- AND THEN

01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:41.143
YOU HAVE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES IN

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:42.612
IMPLEMENTING AND SCHOOL THAT.

01:04:42.678 --> 01:04:45.214
DOES NOT HAVE. ANY AFTER SCHOOL

01:04:45.281 --> 01:04:47.617
PROGRAMMING. WHAT DO YOU SEE IN

01:04:47.683 --> 01:04:49.018
BOTH CASES A SCHOOL THAT HAS

01:04:49.085 --> 01:04:50.987
ACES OR TWENTY FIRST CENTURY IN

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:51.988
A SCHOOL THAT DOES NOT HAVE ANY

01:04:52.054 --> 01:04:52.855
AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMMING. WHAT

01:04:52.922 --> 01:04:54.223
HE SEES THE CHALLENGES IN

01:04:54.290 --> 01:04:55.558
SCALING UP BECAUSE I THINK WE

01:04:55.625 --> 01:04:57.760
HEARD FROM ALEJO. THAT THERE

01:04:57.827 --> 01:04:58.828
HAVE BEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND

01:04:58.894 --> 01:04:59.762
I'VE HEARD THIS FROM SCHOOL

01:04:59.829 --> 01:05:01.197
DISTRICTS IN MY- DISTRICT I

01:05:01.264 --> 01:05:02.798
REPRESENT. THAT THERE ARE

01:05:02.865 --> 01:05:04.634
CHALLENGES THEY FACE AND IT IN

01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:05.668
IMPLEMENTING THIS PARTICULARLY

01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:07.370
AT THE PACE THAT'S ANTICIPATED

01:05:07.436 --> 01:05:09.038
BY THE ADMINISTRATION. SO WHAT

01:05:09.105 --> 01:05:10.706
DO YOU SEE AS THE ACTUAL

01:05:10.773 --> 01:05:12.375
CHALLENGES IS THAT FACILITIES IS

01:05:12.441 --> 01:05:15.011
IT. STAFFING IS IT- PROGRAMMING

01:05:15.077 --> 01:05:19.382
SOMETHING ELSE AND. AND I THINK

01:05:19.448 --> 01:05:20.449
WE COULD START WITH THE

01:05:20.516 --> 01:05:25.488
DEPARTMENT EDUCATION HERE. THE

01:05:25.554 --> 01:05:27.556
PROBLEM WITH CHALLENGE. IN

01:05:27.623 --> 01:05:30.926
EITHER CASE IN EITHER SCENARIO.

01:05:30.993 --> 01:05:32.862
IS WORKFORCE. AT THIS TIME THERE

01:05:32.928 --> 01:05:36.532
ARE. SOME WHO ARE TRYING TO

01:05:36.599 --> 01:05:38.534
THINK THROUGH THE CHALLENGES IN

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:40.703
FACILITIES WITH OFFERING THE

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:41.637
PROGRAM TO TRANSITIONAL

01:05:41.704 --> 01:05:44.540
KINDERGARTEN. AND I THINK SOME

01:05:44.607 --> 01:05:46.509
OF THE CHALLENGES ALSO FACING

01:05:46.575 --> 01:05:48.377
DISTRICTS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION

01:05:48.444 --> 01:05:53.049

01:05:53.115 --> 01:05:54.750
EVERY DISTRICT ARE FOR TALK

01:05:54.817 --> 01:05:56.052
ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES

01:05:56.118 --> 01:05:59.388
I CAN OFFER A DISTRICT THAT HAS

01:05:59.455 --> 01:06:01.324

01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:04.327

OVERCOME THOSE CHALLENGES SO. I

01:06:06.395 --> 01:06:09.265
THINK THE WORK IS TO CREATE. A

01:06:09.332 --> 01:06:12.568
PEER NETWORKS WITH DISTRICTS TO

01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:15.037
CONNECT DISTRICTS WHO ARE. MAYBE

01:06:15.104 --> 01:06:16.238

01:06:16.305 --> 01:06:18.140
THROUGH THE CHALLENGES WITH THE

01:06:18.207 --> 01:06:22.011
DISTRICT WHO HAS FOUND A WAY TO

01:06:22.078 --> 01:06:23.012
. SEE THE CHALLENGE IS AN

01:06:23.079 --> 01:06:25.214
OPPORTUNITY. AND I THINK FOR

01:06:25.281 --> 01:06:27.116
THOSE DISTRICTS THAT ARE

01:06:27.183 --> 01:06:30.186
PRIMARILY THINKING THIS IS WHAT

01:06:30.252 --> 01:06:31.854
OUR DISTRICT HAS TO IMPLEMENT

01:06:31.921 --> 01:06:33.856
WITH OUR OWN STAFF WE HAVE TO

01:06:33.923 --> 01:06:36.225
HIRE NEW STAFF OR IN OUR OWN

01:06:36.292 --> 01:06:38.494
FACILITIES. CONNECTING THEM WITH

01:06:38.561 --> 01:06:41.297
DISTRICTS WHO HAVE REALLY TAKEN

01:06:41.364 --> 01:06:44.400
A CLOSE LOOK. WHAT OTHER ASSETS

01:06:44.467 --> 01:06:46.769
ARE OUT THERE IN IN AND AROUND

01:06:46.836 --> 01:06:48.504
OUR COMMUNITY EVEN IN SMALL

01:06:48.571 --> 01:06:51.207
RURAL DISTRICTS TO FIND A WAY TO

ALSO. IN THE BUDGET AND ANOTHER

01:07:00.716 --> 01:07:03.753
INITIATIVE. BUT FOR A SMALL

01:07:03.819 --> 01:07:06.389
COMMUNITY SCHOOLS DONE WELL ARE

01:07:06.455 --> 01:07:09.625
A WAY OF. THINKING OF PARTNERING

01:07:09.692 --> 01:07:11.160
AND CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:07:11.227 --> 01:07:14.697

01:20:18.513 --> 01:20:19.948
WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT IN ONLY A

01:20:20.015 --> 01:20:21.583
IS AND THERE WAS THE DEPARTMENT

01:20:21.650 --> 01:20:23.552
OF REHABILITATION BUT- WE'RE

01:20:23.618 --> 01:20:24.619
GOING TO GET THERE SO THAT

01:20:24.686 --> 01:20:26.087
PEOPLE LISTENING THAT AREN'T

01:20:26.154 --> 01:20:29.724
FAMILIAR UNDERSTATEMENT. ARM ARE

01:20:31.726 --> 01:20:33.228
QUESTIONS BECAUSE I WANT TO GIVE

01:20:33.295 --> 01:20:37.632
MY- COLLEAGUES A CHANCE TO ASK

01:20:37.699 --> 01:20:41.336
QUESTIONS AS WELL. AND THE FIRST

01:20:41.403 --> 01:20:42.470
ONE MAYBE FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:20:42.537 --> 01:20:47.542
FINANCE A TO START. THE HOST

01:20:47.609 --> 01:20:49.744
SINCE THE PROPOSAL CAME OUT. I

01:20:49.811 --> 01:20:52.113
HEARD FROM THE LOCAL AGENCIES

01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:55.684
THE CELL POSE. AND SO I WONDERED

01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:58.019
IF YOU COULD JUST A LITTLE. MORE

01:20:58.086 --> 01:21:00.789
CLEARLY EXPLAIN UNDER THE

01:21:00.855 --> 01:21:03.458
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL WHAT

01:21:03.525 --> 01:21:05.493
THE NOTABLE DIFFERENCES MIGHT BE

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:08.330
AND THE ROLE THEY PLAY COMPARED

01:21:08.396 --> 01:21:12.334
TO THEIR ROLE TODAY. AND I THINK

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:14.703
WE'VE BEEN JOINED BY LIST MIGHT

01:21:14.769 --> 01:21:17.472
SO MAYBE THAT'S A DIRECT HER.

01:21:17.539 --> 01:21:19.441
YES HI- THIS MIGHT DEPARTMENT OF

01:21:19.507 --> 01:21:22.310
FINANCE SO OUR PROPOSALS ARE NOT

01:21:22.377 --> 01:21:25.847
AND- CURRENTLY TRYING TO CHANGE

01:21:25.914 --> 01:21:31.086
ANY OF THE ROLES THAT SUBWAY.

01:21:31.152 --> 01:21:32.187
WELL THAT'S A FASCINATING

01:21:32.254 --> 01:21:35.056
RESPONSE- ONLY BECAUSE THEY ALL

01:21:35.123 --> 01:21:37.425
THINK THAT THERE'S A CHANGE IS

01:21:37.492 --> 01:21:39.127
IT BECAUSE OF CHANGE IN FUNDING

01:21:39.194 --> 01:21:41.529
BUT NOT ROLES THAT I NOT ASKED

01:21:41.596 --> 01:21:43.798
THE QUESTION CORRECTLY A WHY DO

01:21:43.865 --> 01:21:45.634
THEY THINK THERE'S A CHANGE IN

01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:48.236
WIDER DAY EXPRESSING. THEIR FREE

01:21:48.303 --> 01:21:52.040
FLOATING ANXIETY OVER THE CHANGE

01:21:52.107 --> 01:21:54.376
. SO FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND

01:21:54.442 --> 01:21:56.144
THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME

01:21:56.211 --> 01:21:58.913
MISUNDERSTANDING WHEN- THE

01:21:58.980 --> 01:22:00.448
BUDGET WAS FIRST RELEASED AROUND

01:22:00.515 --> 01:22:02.284
WHT I'M CALCULATING THE BASE

01:22:02.350 --> 01:22:03.451
FUNDING AT THE L. E. LEVEL

01:22:03.518 --> 01:22:06.921
ACTUALLY MEANT- YOU KNOW THAT-

01:22:06.988 --> 01:22:10.425
SOME- SOME SALT IS. THOUGHT THAT

01:22:10.492 --> 01:22:11.626
MEANT THAT WE WERE ALSO FLOWING

01:22:11.693 --> 01:22:13.528
FUNDING TO ELEAZAR THAT'S NOT

01:22:13.595 --> 01:22:15.797
THE CASE I KNOW THAT ANOTHER.

01:22:15.864 --> 01:22:18.667
ASPECT THAT HAS BEEN- LIKE

01:22:18.733 --> 01:22:20.135
SOMETHING THAT WE'VE HEARD IS

01:22:20.201 --> 01:22:21.736
THE FLOWING OF THE EDUCATION

01:22:21.803 --> 01:22:24.406
RELATED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

01:22:24.472 --> 01:22:27.942
FUNDING TO- TO ELEAZAR SELF US

01:22:28.009 --> 01:22:29.744
AND STOP FUNDING IS NOT.

01:22:29.811 --> 01:22:31.379
RESTRICTED TO JUST SPECIAL

01:22:31.446 --> 01:22:33.081
EDUCATION AND I KNOW THAT THERE

01:22:33.148 --> 01:22:35.050
HAVE BEEN CONCERNS THAT THIS

01:22:35.116 --> 01:22:36.117
WOULD DISTRACT REGIONAL

01:22:36.184 --> 01:22:38.219
STRUCTURES BUT WE DO NOTE THAT

01:22:38.286 --> 01:22:41.756
THIS. PROPOSAL DOES NOT-

01:22:41.823 --> 01:22:43.391
PRECLUDE ANY POOLING OF

01:22:43.458 --> 01:22:46.361
RESOURCES OR- YOU KNOW BASICALLY

01:22:46.428 --> 01:22:47.796
KEEPING THE STATUS QUO OF HOW

01:22:47.862 --> 01:22:49.831
SERVICE DELIVERY IT IS BEING

01:22:49.898 --> 01:22:50.932
MAINTAINED WE JUST WANT TO

01:22:50.999 --> 01:22:56.771
ALIGN. THE FUNDING- STILL-HOW.

01:22:56.838 --> 01:23:00.442
A FUNDING FLOWS IN AND THANK YOU

01:23:00.508 --> 01:23:01.543
FOR THAT RESPONSE LET ME ASK THE

01:23:01.609 --> 01:23:03.011
OTHER TWO PANELISTS OF EITHER OF

01:23:03.078 --> 01:23:09.718
THEM HAVE A COMMENT ON. NOBODY

01:23:09.784 --> 01:23:12.220
SAYING ANYTHING SO I'M GATHERING

01:23:12.287 --> 01:23:17.325
THERE'S NO COMMENT. OKAY THEN I

01:23:17.392 --> 01:23:21.096
HAVE ONE OTHER QUESTION. IN OUR

01:23:21.162 --> 01:23:22.597
I THINK MAYBE START WITH THE

01:23:22.664 --> 01:23:24.199
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND SAFETY

01:23:24.265 --> 01:23:27.402
OTHERS BECAUSE IN MY OWN OF

01:23:27.469 --> 01:23:29.704
LEGISLATIVE DISTRICT ARE

01:23:29.771 --> 01:23:31.906
COMPARED TO THE LARGE URBAN

01:23:31.973 --> 01:23:33.842
SCHOOL DISTRICTS THEY'RE SMALLER

01:23:33.908 --> 01:23:38.046
SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND SO THE

01:23:38.113 --> 01:23:41.883
QUESTION IS HOW CAN. HOW CAN WE

01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:43.852
PROTECT THE SMALLER DISTRICTS

01:23:43.918 --> 01:23:45.820
FROM EXTENSIVE AMOUNTS OF

01:23:45.887 --> 01:23:48.723
FUNDING ON SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:50.759
LITIGATION AND SPECIALIZED

01:23:50.825 --> 01:23:53.328
PROGRAMS WHICH THEN GET

01:23:53.395 --> 01:23:56.398
ALLOCATED TO THE DISTRICT FUNDS

01:23:56.464 --> 01:23:59.601
N. AND I KNOW THAT- THAT ONE ONE

01:23:59.667 --> 01:24:01.603
PARTICULAR DISTRICT I JUST HAD

01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:04.105
OUT SIZED COSTS FOR ONE CASE IN

01:24:04.172 --> 01:24:05.540
THEIR SMALLER DISTRICTS DIDN'T

01:24:05.607 --> 01:24:07.342
REALLY COMPETES AGAINST.

01:24:07.409 --> 01:24:09.811
CLASSROOM SERVICES AND OTHER

01:24:09.878 --> 01:24:12.447
THINGS WHEN THAT HAPPENED SO- AT

01:24:12.514 --> 01:24:14.983
A IS THERE SOMETHING WE CAN DO

01:24:15.049 --> 01:24:17.485
TO PROTECT. DISTRICTS AND IN

01:24:17.552 --> 01:24:19.454
THOSE SITUATIONS AND ONE EIGHT

01:24:19.521 --> 01:24:21.856
S. FIRST WITH FINANCE AND SEE IF

01:24:21.923 --> 01:24:25.059
ANYBODY ELSE WANTS TO COMMENT. I

01:24:25.126 --> 01:24:27.695
LIST MY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE-

01:24:27.762 --> 01:24:29.731
SO I CAN'T YOU KNOW CAN'T SPEAK

01:24:29.798 --> 01:24:31.166
TO THE SPECIFIC ISSUE THAT

01:24:31.232 --> 01:24:33.001
OCCURRED IN THE DISTRICT YOU'RE

01:24:33.067 --> 01:24:35.203
REFERENCING BUT I WILL OTE THAT

01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:36.504
THERE WASN'T INVESTMENT IN LAST

01:24:36.571 --> 01:24:38.573
YEAR'S BUDGET OF ONE HUNDRED

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:39.374

ALTERNATE DISPUTE RESOLUTION-

01:24:47.182 --> 01:24:49.317
PRACTICES AND THIS IS BASICALLY

01:24:49.384 --> 01:24:51.453
AIMED AT PROMOTING COLLABORATION

01:24:51.519 --> 01:24:52.921
BETWEEN FAMILIES AND SCHOOLS TO

01:24:52.987 --> 01:24:54.355
PREVENT THE STATE FROM OCCURRING

01:24:54.422 --> 01:24:56.357
OR ESCALATING AND THE FUNDS ARE

01:24:56.424 --> 01:24:58.960

WAS A SOLUTION. AND IN FACT WAS%

01:25:16.878 --> 01:25:18.480
A SOLUTION THEY DIDN'T REALIZE

01:25:18.546 --> 01:25:19.781
IT BORTON FACT WAS NOT A

01:25:19.848 --> 01:25:22.484
SOLUTION AND IT BRINGS US BACK

01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:24.986
TO THE QUESTION OF. HOW TO TRY

01:25:25.053 --> 01:25:27.021
TO HELP THEM SO I KNOW I AM A

01:25:27.088 --> 01:25:28.289

01:35:25.953 --> 01:35:28.122
ALIVE IN FACT COUNTIES AND

01:35:28.189 --> 01:35:30.791
THAT'S UP SUBSTANTIALLY FROM THE

01:35:30.858 --> 01:35:34.462
ORIGINAL AMOUNT THAT WAS DONE IN

01:35:34.528 --> 01:35:37.064
TWENTY THIRTEEN OR TWENTY

01:35:37.131 --> 01:35:37.998
FOURTEEN WHATEVER THAT WAS SET

01:35:38.065 --> 01:35:41.268
CORRECT. CORRECT I CAN'T

01:35:41.335 --> 01:35:43.070
REMEMBER WHAT THE AMOUNT WAS-

01:35:43.137 --> 01:35:45.005
ORIGINALLY I THINK THE BUT I

01:35:45.072 --> 01:35:47.908
BELIEVE- IT WAS IT WAS IN THE

01:35:47.975 --> 01:35:48.576
TENS OF MILLIONS OF THINK IT WAS

01:35:48.642 --> 01:35:50.277
MORE IT IS CLOSER TO FIFTY

01:35:50.344 --> 01:35:52.313
MILLION DOLLARS- AND THEN SINCE

01:35:52.379 --> 01:35:53.547
THEN WE'VE HAD SIGNIFICANT

01:35:53.614 --> 01:35:54.815
BECAUSE THE PROPERTY TAX BY

01:35:54.882 --> 01:35:57.284
USERS USE. OF YOU KNOW AND SO

01:35:57.351 --> 01:35:59.253
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO THE

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:00.321
TO A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION I

01:36:00.387 --> 01:36:02.323
BELIEVE UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S.

01:36:02.389 --> 01:36:05.092
BUDGET IDEA THE FINDINGS OF THE

01:36:05.159 --> 01:36:06.127
MISSING THING LIKE A HUNDRED

01:36:06.193 --> 01:36:07.828
TWENTY BILLION FOR THE BUDGET.

01:36:07.895 --> 01:36:09.497
AND THEN- YOU MENTIONED ALIVE

01:36:09.563 --> 01:36:11.298
AND COUNTIES AND AT THAT NUMBER

01:36:11.365 --> 01:36:14.235
HAD GROWN- SO ORIGINALLY IT WAS

01:36:14.301 --> 01:36:15.803
A SMALLER NUMBER OF COUNTIES

01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:18.706
LIKE FOR FIVE MINUTES MOVED TO

01:36:18.772 --> 01:36:22.076
ELEVEN ROUGHLY. YEAH THANKS FOR

01:36:22.143 --> 01:36:23.410
THE CHARACTER OF THE EXACT

01:36:23.477 --> 01:36:24.378
NUMBER OF COUNTIES INITIALLY

01:36:24.445 --> 01:36:25.613
WHEN THIS WHEN THIS WAS AN

01:36:25.679 --> 01:36:27.381
ACTIVE BUT IF IT BECAUSE THAT WE

01:36:27.448 --> 01:36:29.617
HAVE SEEN AN INCREASED NUMBER OF

01:36:29.683 --> 01:36:31.252
COUNTIES WITH KNOWLEDGE AND

01:36:31.318 --> 01:36:33.287
THEN- IS THERE A WAY TO

01:36:33.354 --> 01:36:35.656
CHARACTERIZE THE ELEVEN COUNTIES

01:36:35.723 --> 01:36:38.526
AND WHAT I MEAN IS. IS IF IT'S

01:36:38.592 --> 01:36:40.194
ELEVEN COUNTIES THAT HAVE ACCESS

01:36:40.261 --> 01:36:42.630
PROPERTY TAX MONEY DO THESE TEND

01:36:42.696 --> 01:36:43.931
TO BE COUNTIES THAT HAVE HIGH

01:36:43.998 --> 01:36:53.574
AMOUNTS. OF- PROCESSED PROPERTY

01:36:53.641 --> 01:36:56.043
VALUE AND THE REASON. A MEAN

01:36:56.110 --> 01:36:57.745
THIS IS. WE WERE NEXT TO FIND A

01:36:57.811 --> 01:36:59.647
WHOLE HOST OF ZERO NEVADA

01:36:59.713 --> 01:37:00.948
COUNTIES AND WE BE MORE FOR SO

01:37:01.015 --> 01:37:03.250
WORKS CLARA I KNOW ONE AND OTHER

01:37:03.317 --> 01:37:05.452
PRICE VALUE COUNTY IS THAT A

01:37:05.519 --> 01:37:08.689
FAIR STATEMENT DO YOU THINK-

01:37:08.756 --> 01:37:10.057
GENERALLY FOR IT WITH ALL

01:37:10.124 --> 01:37:10.958
PROPERTY TAX RELATED THINGS BUT

01:37:11.025 --> 01:37:12.927
YOU ALWAYS COME UP WITH QUIRKS.

01:37:12.993 --> 01:37:14.228
YOU KNOW PART OF THE BE FUN HOW

01:37:14.295 --> 01:37:16.463
MY- WHAT'S OF PROPERTY TAXES

01:37:16.530 --> 01:37:18.566
WERE PROVIDED TO EDUCATIONAL

01:37:18.632 --> 01:37:21.468
AGENCIES. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY

01:37:21.535 --> 01:37:22.903
EIGHT WHEN PROPERTY WITHIN ACTED

01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:24.705
IN BOTH THOSE SHARES HAVE BEEN

01:37:24.772 --> 01:37:25.873
FROZEN IN TIME SO. I THINK THERE

01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:27.675
MIGHT BE SOME HIGHER PROPERTY

01:37:27.741 --> 01:37:28.842
VALUE COMPANIES THAT YOU WOULD

01:37:28.909 --> 01:37:30.110
EXPECT TO BE ON THIS LIST BUT

01:37:30.177 --> 01:37:31.745
MAYBE ARE NOT BECAUSE OF THOSE.

01:37:31.812 --> 01:37:32.780
FOR THOSE REASONS BUT IN

01:37:32.846 --> 01:37:35.316
GENERAL- IT YOURSELF THAT'S

01:37:35.382 --> 01:37:37.084
CORRECT- THE COUNTIES WHO TEND

01:37:37.151 --> 01:37:38.652
TO BE ON THIS LIST I BELIEVE

01:37:38.719 --> 01:37:40.521
ROUGHLY HALF OF THE IN TERMS OF

01:37:40.588 --> 01:37:42.289
THE DOLLAR VALUE OF THE AMOUNT

01:37:42.356 --> 01:37:43.424
OF FUNDING THAT. EXTRA FRIENDLY

01:37:43.490 --> 01:37:45.025
ROUGHLY HALF IT COMES FROM SAN

01:37:45.092 --> 01:37:47.428
MATTEO IN SANTA CLARA. AND SOLD

01:37:47.494 --> 01:37:49.063
SUBJECT IT IT IT DOESN'T TO BE

01:37:49.129 --> 01:37:57.905
RELEASED TO COUNTY SAN HAVE. IT

01:37:57.972 --> 01:37:59.940
TURNS OUT HIRED A COUPLE ROLE

01:38:00.007 --> 01:38:02.076
SYSTEM THANK YOU. VERY MUCH THAT

01:38:02.142 --> 01:38:04.445
AND THEN ALSO. THE ASSEMBLY

01:38:04.511 --> 01:38:07.314
COUNTIES THE MALLOY THAT THEY

01:38:07.381 --> 01:38:08.482
HAVE JUST RETURNED TO ADD.

01:38:08.549 --> 01:38:10.484
RATHER THAN OTHER CALL. REFER TO

01:38:10.551 --> 01:38:11.619
IT AS IT THAT WAS DONE AT THE

01:38:11.685 --> 01:38:16.056
HIGH OF THE- MELT- AND LYFT IN

01:38:16.123 --> 01:38:18.659
PLACE THE I DON'T WANT YOU TO.

01:38:18.726 --> 01:38:20.794
HAVE TO ON THE CASE A OF BY IT

01:38:20.861 --> 01:38:21.862
WAS A- DONE A TIME THE BUDGET

01:38:21.929 --> 01:38:23.697
WAS STRUCK IN TENS OF BILLIONS

01:38:23.764 --> 01:38:25.466
OF DOLLARS DEFICIT DID WORKING

01:38:25.532 --> 01:38:28.469
FOR EVERY. OF PLACE TO TRY TO

01:38:28.535 --> 01:38:32.640
DRAW. FROM IS THAT PROBABLY AN

01:38:32.706 --> 01:38:34.642
ACCURATE STATEMENT. I THINK

01:38:34.708 --> 01:38:35.809
THAT'S HER MOTHER INITIAL THE

01:38:35.876 --> 01:38:37.778
FIRST YEAR THAT IT WAS DONE TO

01:38:37.845 --> 01:38:38.846
THE PEOPLE THAT INTO ELEVEN WHEN

01:38:38.912 --> 01:38:42.182
THE STATE WAS IN IN A PRETTY ARE

01:38:42.249 --> 01:38:44.385
. I WAS SORT OF RIGHT BEFORE-

01:38:44.451 --> 01:38:45.819
THE PASSAGE OF PROP THIRTY AS

01:38:45.886 --> 01:38:48.389
REVENUES TO COME TICKET

01:38:48.455 --> 01:38:52.660
SOMETHING THAT BOB OF OUR- JUST

01:38:52.726 --> 01:38:55.396
TO- THINK. I THINK I'M- BUT WE

01:38:55.462 --> 01:38:56.964
GOT TO THIRTEEN FORTY MINUTES

01:38:57.031 --> 01:38:59.400
WAS IN A ON A PER BASIS I DON'T

01:38:59.466 --> 01:39:00.634
KNOW I WOULD CHARACTERIZED FACT

01:39:00.701 --> 01:39:03.170
THAT WAS THE- ANYMORE- I WOULD

01:39:03.237 --> 01:39:10.444
SAY ALSO. PART OF WHY IT.

01:39:10.511 --> 01:39:13.180
PROVIDED YOUR- A COMMUNITY AN

01:39:13.247 --> 01:39:15.516
OPTION BUT THE THING THAT HAS.

01:39:15.582 --> 01:39:17.751
LOOKED BACK COUNTY. PROPERTY TAX

01:39:17.818 --> 01:39:19.887
THE GIVEN AND OTHER. SUPPORT

01:39:19.953 --> 01:39:22.289
THESE FIND ARE A PEOPLE. IS

01:39:22.356 --> 01:39:23.791
STRICTLY WITH THE- THERE IS SOME

01:39:23.857 --> 01:39:25.125
SPECIALIST. FROM THAT IS COMES

01:39:25.192 --> 01:39:27.661
FROM PROPERTY TO VALUE. BETTER

01:39:27.728 --> 01:39:30.731
FROM YOU STILL- THE PRACTICE OF

01:39:30.798 --> 01:39:32.599
FINDING IDENTIFIED OTHER WAYS

01:39:32.666 --> 01:39:35.002
TO. THAT FUNDING BE I- DURING

01:39:35.069 --> 01:39:38.305
THAT. PIECES B. R. THE TIME. OF

01:39:38.372 --> 01:39:40.240
FOR MOST OF. I THINK IT HAS

01:39:40.307 --> 01:39:42.176
SOMETHING OF THE STATE HAS. IN

01:39:42.242 --> 01:39:44.712
THE PREVIOUS YEARS. AND I THINK

01:39:44.778 --> 01:39:55.422
. THAT. AND I THINK YOU ANSWERED

01:39:55.489 --> 01:39:57.024
THIS QUESTION BUT LET ME JUST

01:39:57.091 --> 01:40:00.728
REEMPHASIZE IT. ARM IF FOR ANY

01:40:00.794 --> 01:40:03.530
REASON MONEY WORK TO BE ABLE

01:40:03.597 --> 01:40:06.734
FROM THE ACCESS TAXES GO TO THE-

01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:08.869
EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS. THERE

01:40:08.936 --> 01:40:10.337
WOULD HAVE TO BE A LIKE AMOUNT

01:40:10.404 --> 01:40:13.040
OF MONEY APPROPRIATED FOR THE

01:40:13.107 --> 01:40:15.209
EXPENDITURES THAT WERE DISPLACED

01:40:15.275 --> 01:40:16.944
BY THAT HAPPENING WOULD THAT BE

01:40:17.010 --> 01:40:20.381
CORRECT. RIGHT NOW THIS THIS

01:40:20.447 --> 01:40:22.116
PROVIDES FUND FEEDING FOR THE

01:40:22.182 --> 01:40:24.952
STATE TO COME THE STATE COURT

01:40:25.018 --> 01:40:28.555
COSTS SO IF THE IF FUNDING WERE

01:40:28.622 --> 01:40:30.157
NO TO BE YOU IN THIS WAY THE

01:40:30.224 --> 01:40:32.126
STATE WOULD TO BACK OUT UNDER

01:40:32.192 --> 01:40:33.761
AND FIFTY OR NOT HUNDRED GROW

01:40:33.827 --> 01:40:36.897
TURN TABLE. WITH GENERAL. TO

01:40:36.964 --> 01:40:38.031
COVER THOSE COSTS AND YOU

01:40:38.098 --> 01:40:39.400
INDICATE THE BECAUSE THERE'D

01:40:39.466 --> 01:40:40.167
BEEN QUESTION ABOUT SOME OF THE

01:40:40.234 --> 01:40:43.036
COUNTY. PEOPLE THAT THIS MONEY

01:40:43.103 --> 01:40:45.205
ACTUALLY DOES NOT. OUT OF THE

01:40:45.272 --> 01:40:47.508
COUNTY THAT IF IT WAS COLLECTED

01:40:47.574 --> 01:40:49.343
AS PROPERTY TAX WITHIN A COUNTY

01:40:49.410 --> 01:40:51.044

01:40:51.111 --> 01:40:56.850
THAT ARE WITHIN THAT COUNTY IT.

01:40:56.917 --> 01:40:58.719
DOESN'T MOVE AROUND SAID CORRECT

01:40:58.786 --> 01:41:00.621
. MIKE DO YOU. THINK FROM. OUR

01:41:00.687 --> 01:41:03.724
THE COMING. I BELIEVE THAT. THE

01:41:03.791 --> 01:41:05.058
POLITICS OF THE CALL BEFORE.

01:41:05.125 --> 01:41:08.729
RATHER ARE GOING TO FONG- THE

01:41:08.796 --> 01:41:10.130
FUNDING IS TRYING TO THERE THEN

01:41:10.197 --> 01:41:13.267
THEN THE TO BELIEVE IF YOU GO.

01:41:13.333 --> 01:41:14.501
BEING TRANSFERRED TO THE TO THE

01:41:14.568 --> 01:41:17.538
COURTS TO FOR TWENTY. FROM THE

01:41:17.604 --> 01:41:19.039
TH STATE'S PERSPECTIVE IT NOT

01:41:19.106 --> 01:41:20.741
COMING TO THIS AND STATE

01:41:20.808 --> 01:41:22.643
DIVISION PROFESSOR WAY. I'VE

01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:26.213
BEEN REMAINS ALL OF LOCAL. BACK

WAS CREATED SEVERAL YEARS AGO

01:41:27.681 --> 01:41:29.716
FOR A VARIETY OF OTHER OF ACTIVE

01:41:29.783 --> 01:41:31.652
LIKE THIS. WERE FUNDS WOULD BE

01:41:31.718 --> 01:41:34.354
USED LOOK. AMERICA STABLE MEANS

01:41:34.421 --> 01:41:36.623
THAT THE- MY THAT. YOU TO BE

01:41:36.690 --> 01:41:38.091
SPENT ON THE TRUCK WERE WITH

01:41:38.158 --> 01:41:39.660
THEM AS- THE- WILL. THEIR

01:41:39.726 --> 01:41:41.795
RECORDS. IN THE COUNTIES RECEIVE

01:41:41.862 --> 01:41:43.397
LESS GENERAL. BECAUSE THE

01:41:43.464 --> 01:41:45.132
RECEIVING TAX DOESN'T HAVE ANY

01:41:45.199 --> 01:41:47.067
IMPACT. FOR THE COURTS OF THE

01:41:47.134 --> 01:41:48.535
MISSING NET HE IN THE AMOUNT OF

01:41:48.602 --> 01:41:52.739
ALSO TO. HAS MOVED AMONG CAN PER

01:41:52.806 --> 01:41:54.675
PROP TAXES JOHN AND THEN NEXT

01:41:54.741 --> 01:41:56.410
QUESTION MAY BE UNDER. PLONGEON

01:41:56.477 --> 01:42:12.226
THE WE BUT OF. THE IT TERMS OF

01:42:12.292 --> 01:42:13.660
WHAT I MEANI GUESS I CAN SEE

01:42:13.727 --> 01:42:16.029
IF. THE FUNDING. I THINK THE WAY

01:42:16.096 --> 01:42:17.865
WE NEED TO DO IT THERE WHEN HE

01:42:17.931 --> 01:42:19.433
WAS SORT OF STAYED IN THE CAMP

01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:21.235
OF THE COPIER. WE COUNTY ALSO

01:42:21.301 --> 01:42:22.503
THE- SO ASSEMBLY. HAVE WOULD BE

01:42:22.569 --> 01:42:27.541
ABLE RECORD INTEREST DON'T. I

01:42:27.608 --> 01:42:29.276
DON'T THINK OF THE BIG. INTEREST

01:42:29.343 --> 01:42:31.979
ON THEIR NEVER A- THAT. FOR MY

01:42:32.045 --> 01:42:34.281
ANDERSON. NOT AND- SOMETHING

01:42:34.348 --> 01:42:34.915
THOSE SPECIFICALLY CONCERT WHEN

01:42:34.982 --> 01:42:37.317
Y. OF. THE FUNDING WOULD MOVE.

01:42:37.384 --> 01:42:40.387
OUT TO OUR- TO THE- FOR GENERAL

01:42:40.454 --> 01:42:42.689
TAKES FOR COURTS. I WITH. I DO

01:42:42.756 --> 01:42:44.224
IS JUST SORT OF A FACT. MATTER

01:42:44.291 --> 01:42:46.326
WHETHER THAT. TRUE AND I'D- THAT

01:42:46.393 --> 01:42:52.599
. AND THEN LASTLY. IT. I PASS.

01:42:52.666 --> 01:42:53.867
SOME OF THE COW IN QUESTION IF

01:42:53.934 --> 01:42:54.768
THEY WOULD. INDICATE WHAT THEY

01:42:54.835 --> 01:42:59.873
SPEND THE MONEY IF- IF- IT IT

01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:01.875
TURNS OUT THAT THAT THEY WERE UP

01:43:01.942 --> 01:43:05.679
FOR COMPETITION WITH THE- WITH

01:43:05.746 --> 01:43:07.814
THE OTHER FUNDS AND SO I THINK

01:43:07.881 --> 01:43:10.284
D. A. OBVIOUSLY IN THE TWO

01:43:10.350 --> 01:43:12.319
COUNTIES THAT YOU MENTIONED. OF

01:43:12.386 --> 01:43:15.856
THE THEY FEEL. STRONGLY THAT

01:43:15.923 --> 01:43:17.257
THIS MONEY IS BEING DIVERTED

01:43:17.324 --> 01:43:19.493
AWAY FROM LOCAL EDUCATION USES

01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:21.962
IN IT TO END AND HAVE STRONG

01:43:22.029 --> 01:43:24.765
CONCERNS ABOUT IT. AND SO I

01:43:24.831 --> 01:43:26.934
THINK THIS DISCUSSION HAS BEEN

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.036
REALLY HEALTHY BECAUSE IT TALKS

01:43:29.102 --> 01:43:31.371
ABOUT HOW THIS ISSUE IS GROWN

01:43:31.438 --> 01:43:33.373
TALKS ABOUT THE COUNTIES. IT

01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:34.875
DRESSES THE ISSUE THAT'S THEIR

01:43:34.942 --> 01:43:36.410
CONCERN OF WHETHER OR NOT THIS

01:43:36.476 --> 01:43:37.811
WAS A GIMMICK OR WHETHER OR NOT

01:43:37.878 --> 01:43:39.713
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE

01:43:39.780 --> 01:43:44.184
REPLACED OVER TIME- IT IT. MAKES

01:43:44.251 --> 01:43:45.686
CLEAR THAT OTHER THINGS WOULD

01:43:45.752 --> 01:43:47.955
HAVE TO BE FUNDED BURKE FOR THE

01:43:48.021 --> 01:43:50.357
DISPLACED COSTS. ARE IT'S CLEAR

01:43:50.424 --> 01:43:51.858
THAT THE MONEY GOES TO THE

01:43:51.925 --> 01:43:55.429
COUNTIES NOW- AND IT'S ALSO

01:43:55.495 --> 01:43:57.998
CLEAR THAT AT LEAST THOSE TWO

01:43:58.065 --> 01:44:00.367
COUNTIES PROBABLY. OR MORE WELL

01:44:00.434 --> 01:44:02.302
TO DO THAT SOME OTHER COUNTIES

01:44:02.369 --> 01:44:05.706
THAT IS IT THIS MIGHT BE

01:44:05.772 --> 01:44:07.674
HAPPENING TO OR NOT. AND THE

01:44:07.741 --> 01:44:10.177
ISSUE OF INTEREST SEEMS OPEN.

01:44:10.243 --> 01:44:14.281
AND THEN. IT HE I HAD ASKED THEM

01:44:14.348 --> 01:44:15.983
TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY MIGHT

01:44:16.049 --> 01:44:19.286
SPEND THE MONEY ON IF IN FACT.

01:44:19.353 --> 01:44:21.321
IT WERE NOT DIVERTED BECAUSE THE

01:44:21.388 --> 01:44:22.456
LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE

01:44:22.522 --> 01:44:24.324
POLICY FINDING THAT THAT IS

01:44:24.391 --> 01:44:26.760
COMPETITIVE WITH THE OTHER

01:44:26.827 --> 01:44:29.229
EXPENDITURES AND SO. THERE'S

01:44:29.296 --> 01:44:31.398
JUST STRONG CONCERN ABOUT THIS

01:44:31.465 --> 01:44:32.899
AND SOME OF THE COUNTIES WHERE

01:44:32.966 --> 01:44:36.069
THIS IS GOING ON AND- AND THE

01:44:36.136 --> 01:44:40.440
IRONY IS THAT. IF IN FACT. THIS

01:44:40.507 --> 01:44:41.908
IS WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE

01:44:41.975 --> 01:44:43.310
STATE TO DO AND THEN THE STATE

01:44:43.377 --> 01:44:45.145
IS WEIGHING THINGS OF IMPORTANCE

01:44:45.212 --> 01:44:47.180
IN THE BUDGET PROCESS WHETHER

01:44:47.247 --> 01:44:49.650
IT'S COURTS AND ACCESS. MIGHT

01:44:49.716 --> 01:44:51.385
IRONICALLY MAKE A CASE FOR

01:44:51.451 --> 01:44:52.919
MOVING SOME OF IT OUT OF THE

01:44:52.986 --> 01:44:56.556
COUNTY OF ORIGIN AND EQUALIZING

01:44:56.623 --> 01:44:57.090
GET THROUGH THE DIFFERENT

01:44:57.157 --> 01:44:59.326
EDUCATION. OUR COUNTY OFFICES OF

01:44:59.393 --> 01:45:01.328
EDUCATION ACROSS THE STATE IN A

01:45:01.395 --> 01:45:03.997
WAY THAT THAT IF THE STATE IS

01:45:04.064 --> 01:45:05.832
PRIORITIZING IT THAT HAPPENS

01:45:05.899 --> 01:45:07.467
BUT- I THINK THEY'LL BE

01:45:07.534 --> 01:45:10.971
CONTINUED TALK ABOUT THIS AND

01:45:11.038 --> 01:45:11.838
THEIR STRONG CONCERN IN SOME

01:45:11.905 --> 01:45:13.840
COUNTIES. AND I THOUGHT IT WAS

01:45:13.907 --> 01:45:14.474
JUST IMPORTANT FOR US TO AGENDA

01:45:14.541 --> 01:45:16.677
I SAID HAVE A DISCUSSION AIRED

01:45:16.743 --> 01:45:19.246
IN THE LIGHT OF DAY AND BE AWARE

01:45:19.312 --> 01:45:21.214

01:45:21.281 --> 01:45:24.051
FROM THOSE ELEVEN COUNTIES SO. I

01:45:24.117 --> 01:45:26.119
APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION. ARE

01:45:26.186 --> 01:45:28.155

ANY OF THESE COUNTIES- WE GIVE

01:45:38.398 --> 01:45:40.834
ANY INFORMATION OR ANY

01:45:40.901 --> 01:45:41.635
OPPORTUNITY FOR INPUT OR

01:45:41.702 --> 01:45:44.104
FEEDBACK. OR DID YOU HAVE A

01:45:44.171 --> 01:45:45.272
PERSONAL CONVERSATION WITH THEM

01:45:45.338 --> 01:45:46.807
ARE BELIEVE ME THEY HAVE HAD

01:45:46.873 --> 01:45:48.508
PERSONAL CONVERSATIONS WITH ME

01:45:48.575 --> 01:45:51.678
OKAY. THEY WERE AND THEN THE

01:45:51.745 --> 01:45:54.381
ENGINE AND I KNOW THAT. I'M BY

01:45:54.448 --> 01:45:55.982
NO THAT- I BELIEVE IT'S THE

01:45:56.049 --> 01:45:58.752
CAPITAL VISORS FIRMS WORKING ON.

01:45:58.819 --> 01:45:59.786
THIS HAS HAD A MEETING WITH

01:45:59.853 --> 01:46:01.354
FINANCE AND OTHER PEOPLE TO

01:46:01.421 --> 01:46:03.590
RAISE THESE ISSUES OKAY BUT LAST

01:46:03.657 --> 01:46:05.826
YEAR IT CAME UP AT THE END OF

01:46:05.892 --> 01:46:07.561
OUR BUDGET PROCESS. WITHOUT

01:46:07.627 --> 01:46:09.563
THERE HAVING BEEN ANY DISCUSSION

01:46:09.629 --> 01:46:13.166
ALONG THE WAY AND SO THIS YEAR I

01:46:13.233 --> 01:46:14.668
THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT. TO

01:46:14.735 --> 01:46:16.336
HAVE THE DISCUSSION SO IF THIS

01:46:16.403 --> 01:46:18.004
CONTINUES AS THE DISCUSSION IN

01:46:18.071 --> 01:46:20.073
THE BUDGET PROCESS WE ARE FULLY

01:46:20.140 --> 01:46:22.242
AIRED THE ISSUES IN A WAY. THAT

01:46:22.309 --> 01:46:24.244
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THEM AND I

01:46:24.311 --> 01:46:27.280
THINK IT'S VERY HARD. FOUR OF

01:46:27.347 --> 01:46:28.849
THE EDUCATION COMMUNITY WHERE

01:46:28.915 --> 01:46:30.083
THIS IS HAPPENING BECAUSE THEY

01:46:30.150 --> 01:46:31.885
REALLY VIEW IT AS SOMETHING THAT

01:46:31.952 --> 01:46:33.854
NORMALLY WOULD COME THEIR WAY.

01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:37.491
AND YET ARE. IN ONE COUNTY

01:46:37.557 --> 01:46:40.761
THAT'S AFFECTED. LAST YEAR. WHEN

01:46:40.827 --> 01:46:42.496
IT WAS RAISED AT THE END OF THE

01:46:42.562 --> 01:46:44.064
BUDGET SESSION I HEARD FROM

01:46:44.131 --> 01:46:45.332
COUNTY GOVERNMENT WHO'S

01:46:45.398 --> 01:46:48.335
INCREDIBLY CONCERNED IT WOULD BE

01:46:48.401 --> 01:46:50.070
A CUT TO THEIR COURT SYSTEM. THE

01:46:50.137 --> 01:46:53.340
END SO ALL THOSE DYNAMICS AROUND

01:46:53.406 --> 01:46:55.242
THEIR- AND I THOUGHT IT WAS

01:46:55.308 --> 01:46:56.743
IMPORTANT THAT EVERYBODY BE

01:46:56.810 --> 01:46:59.880
AWARE OF THE MEN IF THERE IS A

01:46:59.946 --> 01:47:01.648
HARD TO BE ANY CHANGE OVER TIME

01:47:01.715 --> 01:47:03.583
OF ANY KIND WE WOULD'VE HEARD IT

01:47:03.650 --> 01:47:05.218
VERY CLEARLY AND WE WOULD HAVE

01:47:05.285 --> 01:47:06.920
