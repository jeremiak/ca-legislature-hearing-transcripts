I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR THE COMMITTEE FOR ALL THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL. ALSO WANT TO THANK MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WHO MANY OF WHOM ARE CO AUTHORS OF THIS LEGISLATION. THE RENTER'S TAX CREDIT WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO. ONLY INCREASED ONCE AND THAT WAS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE. MORE THAN FORTY YEARS AGO. SINCE THEN THE AVERAGE RENTS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE MORE THAN TRIPLED. SUPPORTING THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE RENTERS HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF IT NINETEEN. RUNNERS ON AVERAGE OR LESS THAN HOMEOWNERS AND FOR MORE AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR JOBS BECAUSE OF THE STAY AT HOME ORDERS. THIS BILL. WOULD NOT THAT DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN SINGLE FILE FILERS WITH DEPENDENTS AND JOINT FILES THAT'S A BIG CHANGE IN OUR CURRENT LAW TODAY. WOULD PROVIDE A THOUSAND DOLLAR CREDIT FOR SINGLES WITH DEPENDENTS AND THOSE JOINT FILERS. IT ALSO PROVIDE A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR CREDIT FOR ALL OTHER SINGLES. I WOULD ALSO MAKE THE RENTER'S TAX CREDIT REFUNDABLE. MEANING EVEN THOSE WITHOUT A TAX OBLIGATION COULD CLAIM THE CREDIT. AND ALL OVER SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND RANCHERS WHO NOW RECEIVE LITTLE OR NO CREDIT. BECOME NEWLY ELIGIBLE ACCORDING TO THE- FRANCHISE TAX BOARD ESTIMATES. THE SMART PROGRESSIVE BILL COMPLIMENTS CALIFORNIA'S LONG TERM GOAL TO INCREASE AND EXPAND ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WHAT WILL TAKE YEARS TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIANS COULD HAVE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HOMES THIS BILL WILL HELP MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS. OUT QUITE QUICKLY. THE BILL IS LONG OVERDUE AS I MENTIONED HAD BEEN CHANGED IN FORTY TWO YEARS OLD A PROVIDE RELIEF TO TWO POINT FOUR MILLION LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME RENTERS.

I CONTINUE TO SUPPORT HER BELL AND I'M GLAD THAT THERE IS AN I. I THINK THE MORE THE MERRIER IN THIS CONVERSATION- WE VERY CLEAR THAT PARKING MANDATES- ARE ANTI HOUSING- DIED IS NOT ABOUT ENDING PARKING IN NEW CONSTRUCTION. PEOPLE WHO BUILD HOUSING ARE GOING TO WANT TO HAVE WHATEVER WORKS FOR IT SO THAT THEY CAN SELL OR RENT OUT- FIVE HOMES- AND IF NOT HAVING ANY PARKING IN A PROJECT IS GOING TO HARM THEIR ABILITY TO DO THAT THEY'RE GOING TO PUT. SOME LEVEL OF PARKING AND- BUT HAVING A ONE SIZE FITS ALL YOU MUST DO AT LEAST ONE PERSON ONE PARKING SPOT PER UNIT OR TWO PER UNITS- REALLY UNDERMINES THAT. GOAL AND WHAT IT DOES IS A FEW THINGS. AND WE KNOW FOR INDIAN I'M GETTING ALICE THAT A REAL GOOD JOB OF LAYING OUT SOME OF THE SIGNIFICANT DOWNSIDES. OF MANDATING PARKING AN OVERSUPPLY OF PARKING BY INCLUDING MAKING HOUSING MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE. AND REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF HOUSING- THAT YOU- THAT IS DELIVERED BECAUSE YOU ONLY HAVE SO MANY SQUARE FEET OF BUILD SOMETHING. AND IF IT'S MANDATED THAT YOU MUST DEDICATE A REALLY HIGH PERCENTAGE. OF THAT SQUARE FOOTAGE THE PARKING THAT MEANS FEWER HOMES ARE BEING BILL AND WE'RE MAKING THAT CHOICE THAT YOU KNOW A LIVING SPACE FOR A CAR IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN A LIVING SPACE FOR HUMAN BEINGS- SO IT'S LONG PAST DUE THAT WE MOVE AWAY FROM THIS PARKING- MINIMUMS AND I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR. I THINK IT IS I ALSO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR HAS BEEN TAKING FEEDBACK AND MAKING. CHANGES TO THE BILL- AND DOING THAT ON HIS OWN WITHOUT BEING FORCED TO DO IT- AND LISTENING- AND I KNOW THAT THAT WILL CONTINUE- I. WILL CENTERS OF THE OPPOSITION- WE HEARD TODAY- YOU KNOW I THINK THERE ARE YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN A STRONG SUPPORTER OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN PLUG THEM IN. I WHERE THEY LIVE I DON'T THINK THAT THAT IS AN ARGUMENT FOR HAVING MORE PARKING. I KNOW IT'S AN ARGUMENT FOR WHATEVER PARKING WE DO HAVE- MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS A IS ACCESS FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND IT'S NOT ONLY FOR GAS VEHICLES. TALKING TO TWO ISSUES- TO ARE NOT IN CONFLICT- THIS BILL- WILL BE COMING TO THE HOUSING COMMITTEE AS A SECOND REFERRAL AND THE AUTHOR AND I ARE ALREADY. PLANNING TO SIT DOWN. I'M GOING TO SUPPORT MOVING THIS BILL OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT OF COURSE I RESERVE MY RIGHT. GLOBAL WORK TOGETHER I MEAN WE WILL PROBABLY HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS THAT WILL WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE AUTHOR- ON BUT- I WILL. BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY AND I'M. HAPPY TO DO THAT. SENATE HERTZBERG. YES THANK YOU FOR MUCH MA'AM YOU KNOW. I LOOKING AT MY NOTES AND ALSO ON THE AND NOW HERE OF US TEN SIXTY SEVEN WITH INTENSITY SO. THE ONLY OPPOSITION WAS A LIVABLE CALIFORNIA SOUTH PASADENA RESIDENTS RESPONSIBLE GROWTH AND- WELL JUST LISTEN I WANTED TO. GET SOME SENSE FROM YOU. MISTER ATIONS CHEER AS TO- ANY CONVERSATIONS YOU MAY HAVE UNDERSTANDING THE OPPOSITION THAT THE BUILDING TRADES BOTH IN LOS ANGELES AND STATEWIDE HAVE WITH RESPECT TO THIS BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THAT ANYTHING IN MY NOTES THAT RESPECT. THE IT THEY DID REACH OUT AND SAY THAT THEY WERE GOING THEY HAD SOME CONCERNS AND WE'RE GOING TO EXPRESS SOME TODAY AND I SAID. COURSE EXPRESS YOUR CONCERNS AND YOU KNOW THEY I WAS NOT BLIND SIDED OF THATCHER. THANK YOU SEE I JUST DON'T HAVE IT. MY QUESTION TO YOU IS YOU KNOW THOSE CONCERNS ARE. WELL I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH- GENERAL CONSTRUCTION CONCERNS I THINK IT HAS TO DO POTENTIALLY WITH HOW THEY NEGOTIATE WITH CITIES- I'M NOT GONNA SPEAK. ON THEIR BEHALF I MEAN. YOU YOU HEARD THERE THE EXPRESSION BUT- YES CERTAINLY I'M GONNA CONTINUE TO TALK TO THEM AS I TALK TO. EVERYBODY TO AS THIS HOPEFULLY MOVED OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY. WELL I YOU KNOW I WISH I WOULD'VE KNOWN- I WANT TO READ THE- ANALYSIS IT WASN'T. I DON'T WANT TO. STOP YOUR BILL FROM MOVING. BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS BEEN. WORKS WITH EVERY BUT IF HE GETS OUT WITHOUT ME THAT'S GREAT. DONALD VOTE FORD ON THE CAN. THAT I WENT TO WORK OUT THIS WEEK. WITH THE BILL ENTRIES WITH WHO I KNOW YOU HAVE A BRILLIANT RELATIONSHIP. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS THIRTY DRAW A YES I A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- ONE THING THAT WE'VE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH IT IN THE HOUSING CRISIS IS NOT ONLY MORE HOUSING MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND I NOTE THAT YOU INCLUDE THAT HERE I GUESS MY QUESTION IS. THERE'S TWO OPTIONS ONE IS THAT IT MUST YOU KNOW IF IT HAS MEETS A 25% A MINIMUM OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. OR THEN THERE'S THE OTHER OPTION COULD YOU EXPLAIN HOW THE TO WORK TOGETHER BECAUSE I WANT TO END UP WITH MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE OF. THE GREATEST CRISIS WE JUST TALKED ABOUT RENTER'S- WE WOULD VOTED TODAY ON THE FLOOR ON ON ON RENTER'S ASSISTANCE SO HE KEEPS COMING UP- WE NEED MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PERIOD. THANK YOU KNOW IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND BASICALLY WHAT I'VE TRIED TO DO IS TO CREATE TO PASS ONE WITH A GREATER INCENTIVE WHICHIS FOR AFFORDABLE AND WORKFORCE HOUSING AND AS THE L. A. TIMES IN AN EDITORIAL NOTED I THINK ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO. CALIFORNIA NEEDS HOUSING ACROSS THE SPECTRUM WE NEED ALL TYPES OF HOUSING BUT WE NEED AFFORDABLE HOUSING MORE SO THAN THAT'S THE MOST CRITICAL NEED- SO I TRIED TO SORT OF CREATE AN INCENTIVE WHERE THERE'S AN EASIER PATH FORWARD. IF YOU'RE GONNA DO AFFORDABLE AND WORKFORCE HOUSING YOU GET OVER THE COUNTER APPROVAL. IF YOU'RE GONNA DO MARKET RATE HOUSING I STILL WANTED TO CREATE A PROCESS BUT WITHIN THAT PROCESS HAVE SOME SAFEGUARDS FOR COMMUNITIES THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE ARENA APPROACH SO. IF YOU CAN SHOW THAT YOUR MARKET RATE HOUSING PRODUCTION IS NOT GOING TO IMPACT THAT CITY'S ABILITY TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SOME OTHER LOCAL HAVE A PASSED SO I'M TRYING TO INCENTIVIZE ONE. BY MAKING THAT PATH EASIER BUT NOT SHUT THE DOOR ON THE OTHER COMPLETELY IF YOU MEET THOSE CERTAIN SAFEGUARDS AND SELF I'M TRYING TO HIT THE SWEET SPOT BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW WITH WITH PRIOR LEGISLATION AND I KNOW- THE CHAIR OF HOUSING- IS A IS A BIG. PROPONENT OF THAT WITH PRIOR LEGISLATION- IT WAS JUST TO DO AWAY WITH PARKING MINIMUMS WITH NO. CONDITIONS IN THERE ISN'T THERE IS A BODY OF DATA TO SHOW THAT THAT IS AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME SUCCESS BUT IN MY MIND MAKING SURE THAT WE INCENTIVIZE THE AFFORDABLE PIECE IS THE PROPER TRADE OFF MAKING IT AN EASIER PATH AND I GO BACK TO. SOMETHING FROM MY LOCAL GOVERNMENT DAYS% WHERE THEY SAID CREATE AN INCENTIVE TO WHERE YOU WANT PEOPLE TO GO WHETHER THAT'S HAVING AN EASIER PATH FOR A SINGLE STORY VERSUS A TWO STORY AND THAT'S THAT WAS SORT OF THE APPROACH SHOULDN'T AND LAST YEAR WHEN I HELD. THE BILL FOLKS SAID WELL PORTANTINO WHAT'S YOUR ALTERNATIVE AND SO I TOOK THAT CHALLENGE SERIOUSLY AND THIS IS MY ATTEMPT TO TRY TO HIT THAT SWEET SPOT AND BALANCE YOUR CONCERNS ON THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PIECE IN THE WORK FORCE HOUSING PEACE. WITH THE THOSE FOLKS WHO THINK THE MARKET. WILL WILL DELIVER THOSE THANKS I'M TRYING TO HIT THAT SWEET SPOT. AND FRANKLY I THINK BOTH SIDES ARE LITTLE ONE EVEN. ARE UNEASY WHICH MEANS I'M PROBABLY CLOSE TO THAT TO THAT SWEET SPOT- ONE OF MY CONCERNS WITH ANOTHER ANOTHER VERSION OF THIS BILL AS FAR AS PARKING REQUIREMENTS IS THAT- THERE WOULD BE PARKING FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT YOUR BILL SOUNDS WITH THAT BUT- HERE WE GO AGAIN WITH EQUITY ISSUES RIGHT SO IF YOU HAVE A NICE. TESLA RIGHT THEN THERE WILL BE PARKING FOR YOU THAT DOES TAKE UP THE SPACE FOR AN ANOTHER UNIT OF HOUSING BUT DON'T USE THE OTHER KIND OF AUTOMOBILE WHICH IS WHAT MOST LOW INCOME MODERATE INCOME PEOPLE HAVE BECAUSE THAT'S ALL THEY CAN AFFORD- SO IT TO ME IT'S LIKE WAIT A MINUTE I THOUGHT I THOUGHT WE WERE TRYING TO GET TO MORE HOUSING BUT YOU'RE MAKING THIS EXCEPTION SO IS THAT A FOR YOU- AND I ALSO AGREE WITH- CENTER HERTZBERG THE LABOR ISSUES I HOPE. YOU WORK ON THOSE AND ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS NOW I WILL TRY MY BEST AND I DO WANT TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO THE CHAIR AS WELL HE ORIGINALLY HI I SAID AFFORDABLE WORK FORCE AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THE CHAIR MENTIONED STUDENTS AND THAT'S THE SEGMENT OF OUR POPULATION THAT YOU KNOW NEEDS MORE HOUSING AS WELL AS WE'VE SEEN IN BERKELEY AND SO THEY'RE ALSO PART OF THAT 5% THE STUDENT HOUSING SO- I'M TRYING TO TAKE THE INPUT I'M TRYING TO BE AS PRAGMATIC AND YOU KNOW SORT OF REFEREE BETWEEN THE OPPOSING VIEWS ON THIS AND- THIS IS MY FIRST POLICY COMMITTEE IN THE FIRST STABENOW'S. MICE FROM SAN AMENDMENTS UP TO THIS POINT AS WELL SO. I'M LOOKING TAKES TO GET THE INPUT AND CONTINUE BUT I DO THINK. THERE'S A ROLE FOR US TO PLAY. IN DEFINING WHAT WE WANT OUT OF THIS PARKING DISCUSSION AND I THINK AGAIN GOING BACK WITH THE L. A. TIMES SAID WE NEED HOUSING. BUT WE NEED MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAN THAN OTHERS AND SO THAT'S WHAT I'M REALLY TRYING TO MAKE SURE WE GET IN ONE OF MY CONCERNS ABOUT. IF YOU CREATE SUCH A DESIRABLE. AREA YOU KNOW WITHOUT. CONTROLS THOSE RIGHTS EVEN IF THEY START. BEING A LITTLE BIT MORE. LESS EXPENSIVE THAN IF IT HAD PARKING OVER TIME. THE DESIRABILITY WILL DRIVE UP THOSE COSTS AND THEN WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO. PRICE OUT MIDDLE CLASS TEACHERS FIREFIGHTERS WERE WORKING TO PRICE THEM OUT AND SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THAT BALANCE SO THAT'S MY GOAL- AND LIKE I SAID I'M GETTING HIT FROM BOTH SIDES SO THAT MEANS I'M- PROBABLY. DOING THE RIGHT THING. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE IF THAT. TAKE OUT OF MY CLOTHES MANAGER VERY GOOD EIGHT I WILL AND I APPRECIATE THAT- THERE IS A MOTION- THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED BUT FIRST AMEND AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON HOUSING. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SENATOR CAMBIADO I CABALLERO HI SENATOR NIELSEN ALL RIGHT NIELSEN HI SENATOR DORADO. DORADO HI SENATOR HERTZBERG. SENATOR WIENER WIENER HI.

ELEVEN SEVENTY SEVEN- YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU A MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. BEFORE BEGAN I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS OUTLINE IN THE ANALYSIS- SO THANK YOU AGAIN TO YOUR STAFF AND MY STAFF FOR WORKING- IN CONCERT WITH EACH OTHER. AS WE KNOW CALIFORNIA IS IN THE MIDST OF A HOUSING CRISIS WHICH WE'VE ALL JUST TALKED ABOUT IT WILL CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT TO WE pCALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING AND DEVASTATING EFFECT IT'S HAD ON. IN PARTICULAR LOW INCOME HOUSING RENTS AND HOME PRICES HAVE OUTPACED WAGE GROWTH FOR MOST OF- THE HOMES THROUGHOUT THE REGION AND THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA LOWER INCOME RESIDENTS OF PASADENA GLENDALE AND BURBANK HAVE BEEN IMPACTED PARTICULARLY HARD. AS THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING FOR THE REGION HAS OUTPACED THOSE IN SURROUNDING LOS ANGELES AREAS- AND SO THEY'VE COME TOGETHER TO WANT TO ADDRESS IT AS THREE CITIES- SO SB ELEVEN SEVENTY SEVEN CREATES A REGIONAL HOUSING TRUST. THAT WOULD BE ADMINISTERED BY JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY- BETWEEN BURBANK GLENDALE AND PASADENA THE JPA WOULD BE ALLOWED TO REQUEST AND RECEIVE PRIVATE AND STATE FUNDING ALLOCATIONS AS WELL AS AUTHORIZED ISSUE OF BONDS. TO HELP FINANCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS FOR PERSONS AND FAMILIES OF EXTREMELY LOW VERY LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS HELP ADDRESS THIS LOCAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS BETWEEN THE THREE CITIES. LET ME SET BETWEEN THE THREE CITIES WE HAVE MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND NEW AFFORDABLE UNITS IN DEVELOPMENT THAT'S GREAT FOR THESE THREE CITIES- AND I APPLAUD THEM AND THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY OVER THE PAST DECADE. TO MEET THE DEMANDS AND TO MEET THE RENO NUMBERS CREATING THEIR OWN GPS JPA WILL ALLOW THE CITIES TO WORK ON FUNDING FOR THE FOUNDER PORTABLE HOUSING UNITS LOCALLY WITHIN THE REGION THROUGH THE HOUSING TRUST FUND INSTEAD OF HAVING TO GO. TO MULTIPLE OTHER JP ACE OR TO THE STATE OF THE CITIES WANT TO BRING NEW AFFORDABLE DEVELOPMENTS TO THE REGION AND TACKLING THIS CRISIS IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD ALL GET BEHIND WITH ME TODAY ON THE PHONE TO TESTIFY I HAVE.

YET THERE STILL ISN'T ENOUGH BURBANK'S REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT ARENA NUMBERS IS. EIGHT THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO UNITS AND BURBANK DIFFICULT TO BUILD TWELVE THOUSAND UNITS BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. THE FUNDS RECEIVED THROUGH THE PROPOSED REGIONAL TRUST COULD BRING.

THANK YOU MORE GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- I AM HERE TODAY TO PRESENT SB NINE NINETY ONE SB NINE ANYONE WILL ALLOW% LOCAL WATER AGENCIES TO CONTRACT WITH ENTITIES THAT THEY USE THE PROGRESSIVE DESIGN BUILD CONTRACTING MODEL IN THE EXECUTION CALIFORNIA PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS THE MORE TRADITIONAL COMMONLY DEPLOYED DESIGN BUILD CONTRACTING MODEL DEVELOPS DESIGN PACKAGES BASED ON PARAMETERS FROM THE AGENCY TYPICALLY WITHOUT WITHOUT THE AGENCIES DIRECT INPUT DURING THE DESIGN PROCESS. THE DESIGN BUILD METHOD IS USEFUL FOR PROJECTS THAT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO CHANGE BUT CAN BE LESS EFFICIENT AND MORE COSTLY IF THERE ARE MATERIAL CHANGES MADE TO A PROJECT SCOPE THE PROGRESSIVE DESIGN BUILD CONTRACTING MODEL IS A MODEL IN WHICH A SINGLE ENTITY IS HIRED AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE IN THE PROJECT TO DO BOTH THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION WORK FOR THE PROJECT IN RECENT YEARS THE PROGRESSIVE DESIGN BUILD MODEL HAS INCREASED IN POPULARITY BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS A VERY COST EFFECTIVE FORM OF COLLABORATIVE PROJECT DEVELOPMENT. PROGRESS TO DESIGN BUILD OFFERS AN AGENCY OPPORTUNITY TO BRING A DESIGN BUILDER OF THE PROJECT TEAM AND EARLY POINT THE DESIGN PHASES COLLABORATION CAN REDUCE OVERALL PROJECT RISKS COSTS AND EXPEDITE SCHEDULES UNDER CURRENT STATUTE HOWEVER THERE ARE EXPLICIT SPECIFICATIONS AND LIMITS ON THE TYPES OF CONTRACTING MODELS THAT LOCAL AGENCIES ARE PERMITTED TO UTILIZED IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE LEGISLATIVE GRANT THE LEGISLATURE GRANTED THE DIRECTOR GENERAL SERVICES. THE AUTHORITY TO USE THE PDB METHOD FOR UP TO THREE PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM THIS CONTRACTING METHOD ABOVE THAT NUMBER HOWEVER LOCAL AGENCIES ARE REQUIRED TO SEE CAN RECEIVE LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL IN ORDER TO BE PERMITTED TO CONTRACT WITH AN ENTITY THAT UTILIZES THE PROGRESSIVE DESIGN BUILD METHOD FOR DEVELOPING PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS RECENT DATA AND FORECASTS HAVE SHOWN THE CALIFORNIA WILL NEED TO DEVELOP SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL CAPACITY TO TREAT WATER FORTUNATELY TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS THAT ARE HAVE OPENED THE DOOR TO NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO CONVERT WASTE WATER INTO DRINKING WATER IN ORDER TO DO SO AT SCALE THOUGH. CALIFORNIA SURPRISINGLY SIX HUNDRED LOCAL WATER AGENCIES WILL NEED TO INVEST IN NEW INFRASTRUCTURE THAT INCORPORATES INNOVATIVE TREE EVEN METHODS BY ALL. THE X. UNIVERSE. OF PROGRESSIVE DESIGN BUILD AS A CONTRACTING MODEL SB NINETY A NEW ONE WILL ALLOW LOCAL WATER AGENCIES TO MAKE NECESSARY COST EFFECTIVE INVESTMENTS IN NEW PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS TO MEET THE STATE'S GROWING. WATER TREATMENT NEEDS HERE WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN PERSON THIS AFTERNOON ARE MATT SCOTT SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT RIGHT IN DISTRICT MANAGER OF THE CUBIC CORPORATION.

I RESPECTFULLY ASKING FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THIS AFTERNOON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER SCOTT A GOOD AFTERNOON- THIS QUEUE IT IS WITH THEM AND ONE OF NORTH AMERICA'S LARGEST AND MOST RESPECTED ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES- AND KEEP ITS COMMITMENT TOWARD CRAFT EMPLOYEES THEIR SAFETY PROJECT QUALITY ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP BURKE INGRAINED IN EVERYTHING WE DO HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE WATER COLLABORATIVE DELIVERY ASSOCIATION THE SPONSOR OF SB NINE NINETY ONE. SB NINE NINETY ONE WILL GIVE CITIES COUNTIES AND LOCAL AGENCIES A POWERFUL TOOL TO DELIVER PROJECTS USING THE PROGRESSIVE DESIGN BUILD METHOD. D. B. AS A VALUABLE FORM OF COLLABORATIVE PROJECT DELIVERY AND DELIVERY AND CAN PROVIDE MULTIPLE BENEFITS WHEN USED TO EXECUTE COMPLEX PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT. PTV IS A PROJECT DELIVERY METHOD THAT ALLOWS THE PROJECT TEAM TO COLLABORATIVELY PERFORM DESIGN CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND CONSTRUCTION ACCORDING TO DESIGN PARAMETERS PERFORMANCE CRITERIA AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS ESTABLISHED. BY THE PUBLIC AGENCY OWNERS PTV DELIVERY BENEFITS THE PUBLIC AGENCY OWNER BY PROVIDING THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADD THE DESIGN BUILD TEAM TO THE OVERALL PROJECT TEAM EARLY IN THE DESIGN PHASE. ACCORDING TO PUBLIC AGENCY OWNER AND DESIGN BUILD TEAM ENABLING THE PUBLIC AGENCY OWNER AND DESIGN BUILD TEAM MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO COLLABORATE DURING THE PROJECT DESIGN PHASES. EARLY COLLABORATION IS KEY TO REDUCING PROJECT RISK COST AND SCHEDULE. OUR ECONOMY AND CITIZENS DEPEND ON A RELIABLE SUPPLY WATER TO REMAIN GLOBALLY COMPETITIVE SB NINE NINETY ONE WILL ALLOW THE DELIVERY OF PROJECTS TO TREAT WATER RECYCLE WATER OR PRODUCE ADVANCED TREATED WATER TO EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY TO BE A FIFTH EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY STREAMLINED.

MORE HEARING. HAPPILY IN OTHER SO WE DO HAVE THAT AS HEARD ITEM NUMBER EIGHT WE'RE GOING TO GO OUT OF- THERE IS A- APPOINTMENT TO BE MADE SO WILL TAKE UP ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN WHICH IS SB EIGHT NINETY ONE BY SENATOR HERTZBERG. THANK YOU SO MUCH. MADAM CHAIR. YOU KNOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS THE FEDERAL CLEAN WATER ACT THAT REQUIRES ANY DISCHARGE TO RECORD NPDES PERMIT IN THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR THAT PERMITS CALLED THE- INDUSTRIAL GENERAL PERMIT I DID A BILL A FEW YEARS AGO THEY BASICALLY TRIED TO REQUIRES CITIES TO GET THAT DATA. BUT BILL NUMBER WAS I CAN'T REMEMBER AS TO A FIVE OR SOMETHING I DID A BILL THE NUMBER OF YEARS AGO AND I BASICALLY SAID IF THERE'S A BUSINESS LICENSE WILL APPARENTLY SOME CITIES HAVE WHAT'S CALLED A BUSINESS CERTIFICATE SO WE NOW HAVE TO CLARIFY THE LAW TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS THAT ARE JUST CHARGING A INTO THESE A WATER WAYS- ARE INCLUDED- 95% OF ALL CALIFORNIA WATERWAYS ARE CONSIDERED IMPAIRED OR HIGHLY POLLUTED. THAT FRAMEWORK WE REGISTER TWO THOUSAND NEW AYE KYI AYE G. P. ENROLLEES AND SO WE'RE JUST TRYING TO FILL THE FIX THE WHOLE THERE AND WITH THAT WE HAVE A WITNESS I BELIEVE WHO'S GOING TO TESTIFY JOHN BOTHWELL THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE KEEPERS ALLIANCE THANK YOU MAY BE SEATED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CA.GOV FIFTEEN IN CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS- SEAN BOSWELL IN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR CALIFORNIA BECAUSE KEEP RELIANCE BE REPRESENTED BY TEN WATER KEEPERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WORKING MOSTLY ON WATER QUALITY ISSUES- AS CENTER HERTZBERG MENTIONED SB TWO OH FIVE WE WAS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN- AND WE REALLY TRY TO PUT AN ELEGANT SOLUTION INTO THAT BILL AND THE WAY WE DID IT WAS VERY STREAMLINED. OR ESSENTIALLY THE BUSINESS APPLICANT COMES TO THE MUNICIPALITY HAS A FOUR DIGIT S. I. C. CODE THAT THEY PUT IN THEIR APPLICATION AND IF THAT CODE MATCHES UP WITH WHAT'S ON THE WEBSITE STATE WATER BOARD THEN THEY NEED TO PROVIDE ONE MORE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER THAT THEY DID PROPERLY IN ROLE IS VERY ELEGANT SOLUTION- AND BUT IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD BETWEEN ALL INDUSTRIES. I THEN HAD TO UNROLL IT ON THIS PERMIT BEFORE TWO OH FIVE WE ESTIMATE THERE WAS OVER TWENTY THOUSAND NON FILERS WHICH WERE CALLING PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T STOP AND ROLL INTO THE UNDER THE PERMIT- WE ARE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT- AND IT'S BEEN LARGELY VERY SUCCESSFUL- THROUGH THE TWO YEARS OF IMPLEMENTATION- CENTER HERTZBERG MENTIONED THE TWO THOUSAND- INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES BUT OVER SEVEN THOUSAND FOLKS THAT WERE NON FILED BEFORE. HAVE NOW EITHER ENROLLED EITHER GOT AN EXEMPTION OR ARE UNDER THE PERMIT SO THE BILL IN THE PROGRAM IS WORKING THERE WERE SOME PROBLEMS DURING IMPLEMENTATION AS CENTER EXPERT MENTIONED SOME OF THE CITIES CALL IT BY A DIFFERENT NAME IT'S NOT A LICENSES THE CERTIFICATE- AND THEN ALSO SOME INFORMATION WASN'T NECESSARILY PROVIDED- WHEN PUBLIC WOULD REQUESTED AND SO THAT ALL THERE IS A LARGE AMOUNT OF EXEMPTIONS THAT THESE INDUSTRIES SELF PROCLAIMED THAT THEY HAD AND SO WE JUST WANT TO VERIFY. THAT THOSE EXEMPTIONS ARE PROPER AND THAT'S ALL A LOT WITH BILL DOES AS WELL. I'M SOMEONE TOUCH ON THREE QUICK IS THAT WAS IN THE AND NOW. OF THE BETWEEN LICENSE SINCE. AGAIN WHEN YOU'RE DOING SB TWO OH FIVE THAT WAS LARGELY THE CONCERN WE GOT WAS THAT A BUSINESS LICENSE IS REALLY JUST AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE SOME FUNDING- THERE'S NOT REALLY REGULATORY PROCESS TO BACK AND WE WANT TO STICK WITH THAT WE DON'T WANT TO ADD ANY TYPE OF REGULATORY PROCESS AND WE GET TO THAT IN A SECOND. BUT THE IDEA IS SIMPLY TO LOOK IT UP S. I. C. CODE NUMBER AND MATCH IT UP NOT TO MAKE ANY REGULATORY DECISIONS AND WE SPUR STICKING WITH THAT HERE IN SB EIGHT. EIGHT NINE ONE- AND THEN THE SECOND ISSUE I WE'VE BEEN DIGGING INTO. THE CITIES THAT DO HAVE BUSINESS CERTIFICATES. AND THEY SEEM TO BE NO DIFFERENT IN PRACTICE THAN A BUSINESS LICENSE OTHER THAN THE NAME. MANY CERTIFICATES ASK FOR CERTAIN THINGS LIKE. SB TWO FIVE DID FORCIBLY G. ME DIFFERENT ORDINANCES. AND YOU CHECK THE BOX YES I'VE- APPLIED AND YOU KNOW PASS THIS ORDINANCE NOT THAT. TO THE IT'S ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS A LICENSE OTHER THAN THE NAME. OF THE SECOND ISSUE THERE WAS AN ISSUE ABOUT THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST THAT WAS IDENTIFIED THE ANALYSIS AND I WOULD AGREE- WE'RE WE'RE ACTUALLY WORKING ON SOME POTENTIAL AMENDMENTS NOW. TO MAKE IT A LOT MORE CLEAR OF EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET NOT A FULL PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST. CITIES AND COUNTIES ALREADY. NEED TO DISCLOSE DATE NAME AND ADDRESS OF THE APPLICANT- THAT APPLIED FOR THE LICENSE. ALL WE'RE ASKING TO ADD TO THAT IS THE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER THAT THEY PROVIDED SAYING THAT THEY'RE- COVERED UNDER THE INDUSTRIAL STORMWATER PERMIT. SO NOT TRYING TO OPEN IT UP FOR ANY TYPE OF TAX OR FINANCIAL INFORMATION. SO WE'RE GONNA. TAKE AMENDMENTS TO NARROW THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT CONCERN IS ALLEVIATED. AND THE LAST ONE AND IT'S IN SUBSECTION I'D BUT- ON IT WAS REFERENCING THE ANALYSIS AND I DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE WITH- THE WAY. SOME FOLKS ARE READING IT BUT- THAT PROVISION- IS BEING READ TO SAY THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A BUSINESS LICENSE OR CERTIFICATE OR ANY TYPE OF THAT TYPE OF PROGRAM. YOU ESSENTIALLY MIGHT NEED TO CREATE ONE HUNDRED EIGHT NINETY ONE. IT'S THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE ACTUALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO WE'RE TRYING TO CLARIFY. THAT THE CITY OR THE COUNTY HAS NO. REGULATORY DECISION THAT THEY HAVE TO MAKE ON WHETHER THEY HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE PERMANENT NOT. THAT'S A REALLY BIG ISSUE WITH SOME OF THE- LEAST CITIES AND THE COUNTIES BACK INTO A FIVE. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HONOR THAT COMMITMENT. THATWE'RE NOT REQUIRING ANY TYPE OF NEW REGULATORY DECISION MAKING PROCESS. SO I'M COMMITTED- I KNOW WE CAN WORK ON THE LANGUAGE TO MAKE THAT CLEAR BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE WITH SOME OF THE LOCL GUYS THAT. HAVE THOSE CONCERNS. OR WOULD YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE TO WILL JUST REMOVE IT BECAUSE WE REALLY WERE PUTTING IT IN THERE. AS A SAFEGUARD FOR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NOT TRYING TO. PUT ANY NEW ONEROUS ON. THEM SO THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY FOR YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY. THERE ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF. S. EIGHT NINETY ONE. YOUR IN ROOM.

AND THEN ME AFTERWARDS AND PUT THE SERIES OF LAWS TOGETHER THAT REALLY DEAL WITH THE ARCHITECTURE OF THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND IN TWO THOUSAND AFTER FOUR YEARS OF WORK IN TWO MILLION DOLLARS OF INDEPENDENT WORK WITH OUTSIDE GROUPS WE CAME UP WITH WITH- THE BILL CORTESE KNOCKS HERTZBERG. SINCE THEN THIS COMMITTEE I WAS CALLED BECAUSE I CHAIRED THIS COMMITTEE SOME YEARS AGO. COMMITTEE OF EXCEPTIONS BECAUSE EVERY TIME THERE'S ANOTHER JURISDICTION THERE'S NOT BUT LOCAL FIGHT OR WHATEVER THEY KEEP MAKING CHANGES IN THIS. IS WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US IS A BILL THAT IS THE RESULT OF A NUMBER OF YEARS OF WITH THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND OTHERS GOT TOGETHER TRYING TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THE CHALLENGES. RELATING TO SPECIAL DISTRICTS- THE- LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION DID A REPORT WHICH THEN- ARTICULATED SOME OF THOSE WEAKNESSES. AND THEN IT AS A RESULT OF THE GROUP SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND OTHERS WILL IT WILL HAVE CAL ASCO COME AND TALK PAN MILLER'S GONNA COME AND TALK IN. MARKETS THAT LETTERS THAT DID WONDERS SUN. NO OKAY I'M CONFIRM THAT. EVEN IF WORK SO MUCH WE WAS THE CHAIR. HE WAS THE CHIEF STAFF PERSON HERE. MANY IN TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN HE WAS A REAL PRINCIPLE PART OF ALL THIS. AND SO. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND WILL DO EXPLAIN TO YOU WHAT THE ISSUE IS BUT IT SHOULD BE THIS IS BASICALLY A CONSENSUS IS RESULT OF SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND OTHERS GETTING TOGETHER. TRY TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THE CHALLENGES AS WE CONTINUE TO REFINE AND REDEVELOP WHAT LASKO MEANS HOW IT WORKS HOW IT FUNCTIONS AND WITH THAT. HOW INTERNET OVER TO. MISS HELLO OF COURSE SELF. PAM MILLER. THERE ARE A FEW YEARS. WORK TOGETHER A LOT YES WE HAVE VERY GOOD GOOD AFTERNON WELCOME GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE PAMELA MILLER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL AGENCY FORMATION COMMISSION. REPRESENTING LAUGH BECAUSE THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THE VERY PROUD SPONSOR OF SB NINE THIRTY. ARE WE WANT TO THANK AS SPECIAL BALLOT THANK YOU TO SENATOR HERTZBERG AYE HE HAS SPENT MANY LONG YEARS- DABBLING IN LASKO LAW AND WE'RE SO PROUD. OF THAT AND WE GOT TO WORK WITH YOU IN THIS YEAR YOUR LAST YEAR IN THE LEGISLATURE ON THIS- AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED THIS- IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME COMING THIS IS A THREE YEAR. OF VERY COLLABORATIVE PROJECT AND- WE WANT TO THANK YOUR STAFF SENATOR HERTZBERG AND MADAM CHAIR YOUR STAFF IN PARTICULAR AND TIMES. INTRON DREW THE SHORT STRAW MAN WITH SEXUALLY A PARTICIPANT A THREE YEAR PARTICIPANTS IN THE WORKING GROUP AND HE DID A WONDERFUL ANALYSIS ON THE BILL AS WELL. HE ALSO DREW THE SHORT STRAW AND FOLK OF FACILITATING THE SUB COMMITTEE OF THE LARGER WORKING GROUP THAT FOCUSED THEIR WORK ON THE PROTESTS PROVISION THRESHOLDS. SO SB NINE THIRTY EIGHT REPRESENTS AS I SAID A COLLABORATIVE THREE YEAR EFFORT TO CLEAN UP CONSOLIDATE AND CLARIFY EXISTING STATUTORY PROVISIONS ASSOCIATED WITH CONSOLIDATIONS AND DISSOLUTIONS AS WELL AS CODIFY THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH A LAUGH COMEY INITIATE. DISSOLUTION OF THE DISTRICT AT THE 25% THRESHOLD. THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THESE CHANGES IS TO ENSURE THAT LAUGH BECAUSE HAVE THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO CARRY OUT THE STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS TO ENSURE ORDERLY FUNCTIONING LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES AND TO CREATE GREATER CONSISTENCY IN THE STATUTE. THE RESTRUCTURING OF EXISTING PROTEST PROVISION LANGUAGE ACTUALLY CREATES A MORE USABLE STATUTORY FRAMEWORK BY HAVING ALL OF THE PROTEST CODE SECTIONS IN ONE MAIN SECTION TO SIMPLIFY THE READING AND USE OF THAT STATUTE AND AS THE ANALYSIS- VERY WELL POINTS OUT. THE NEW PROTEST PERCENTAGE PROCESS ADDRESSES A LONG STANDING AND VERY LARGE DETERRENT FOR LAST CLOSE TO INITIATE ACTION. EVEN IF MEANINGFUL EFFICIENCIES IN THE PROVISION OF SERVICES COULD BE ACHIEVED OR IF THE DISTRICT IS FAILING TO MEET ITS STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS. FURTHER IT ADDS A LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY FOR BOTH DISTRICTS AND LAUGH CLOSE BY SPOTLIGHTING DETERMINATIONS THAT NEED TO BE MADE IN A MUNICIPAL SERVICE REVIEW BY LASCO. ALLOWING THE DISTRICT A TWELVE MONTH MINIMUM REMEDIATION PERIOD. REQUIRING THE DISTRICT TO PROVIDE A STATUS UPDATE REPORT AT THE MIDPOINT OF THAT REMEDIATION PERIOD AND ADDS SEVERAL ADDITIONAL LEFT CO PUBLIC HEARINGS TO THE PROCESS THEREFORE REALLY ENHANCING THE- THE TRANSPARENCY. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW WE WANT TO MAKE VERY CLEAR THAT THIS PROCESS CAN ONLY BE USED ù DISSOLUTIONS INITIATED DISSOLUTIONS. AND ONLY UNDER THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE CODIFIED IN FIFTY SIX THREE SEVEN FIVE POINT ONE. THE 10%% THRESHOLD FOR LASKO INITIATED ACTIONS STILL EXISTS WE HAVE NOT TOUCH THAT AND LAUGH COMMITTEE CHOOSE TO USE THE 10% THRESHOLD FOR DISSOLUTIONS IF IT FEELS IT IS THE BEST USE. GIVEN THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONDITIONS THAT EXIST LOS LOCALLY THIS BILL IS SIMPLY ANOTHER TOL IN THE LEFT COOK TOOK AT. WE WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS THIS IS AN EIGHTEEN MEMBER STAKEHOLDER GROUP. OF LOTS OF- A REPRESENTATION ALONG THE SPECTRUM FOR THE TIRELESS EFFORTS THAT THEY DID OVER THE THREE YEAR PERIOD TO GET US TO TODAY.

THERE THE CENTER I CAN'T EVEN VOTE ON MY BILL I GUESS SO NOW HILL WHERE HE'LL BE HERE. I DO IT'LL IT'S FILE ITEM NUMBER EIGHT SB. TWELVE FOURTEEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. FIRST ELECTED THINK THE CHAIR AND THE STAFF FOR WORKING ON THIS BILL I THINK WE FOUND A REALLY STRONG COMPROMISE. THAT FURTHERS PUBLIC INTEREST WHILE PROTECTING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. SB TWELVE FOURTEEN STRIKES A BALANCE BETWEEN PROTECTING ARCHITECTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS UNDER THE FEDERAL COPYRIGHT LAW. AND FACILITATING IMPORTANT PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN LOCAL PLANNING DECISIONS THIS BILL ESTABLISHES AN APPROPRIATE MODEL FOR PLANNING DEPARTMENTS TO SHARE ARCHITECTURAL DRAWINGS BASED ON THE EXISTING MODEL. USED BY BUILDING DEPARTMENTS SPECIFICALLY SB TWELVE FOURTEEN ALLOWS ACCESS TO FULL DETAILED ARCHITECTURAL BLUEPRINTS FOR PHYSICAL INSPECTION BY ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC. BY COMING INTO THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT THAT RESTRICTS COPYING THESE COPYRIGHTED MATERIALS UNLESS THE OWNER OF THE COPYRIGHT GIVES PERMISSION. OUTSIDE OF THIS PHYSICAL INSPECTION PLANNING DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO DISPLAY COPYRIGHTED MATERIALS IN PUBLIC HEARINGS. AND PROVIDE DRAWINGS TO ANY MEMBER OF THEIR LEGISLATIVE BODIES AS LONG AS THE COPYRIGHTED DRYING IS NOT STORED ONLINE. TO FOR PUBLIC ACCESS. THIS BILL ALSO ALLOWS PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC UNLIMITED ACCESS TO THE LESS DETAILED NON COPYRIGHTED DRAWINGS. KNOWN AS SITE PLANS AND MASSING DIAGRAMS. WE BELIEVE THAT SB TWELVE FOURTEEN HELPS PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO LOCAL PLANNING DEPARTMENTS PROTECTS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF COPYRIGHT HOLDERS. ENSURES FULL ACCESS TO THE PUBLIC AND LOCAL PUBLIC OFFICIALS. WITH ME TODAY HAVE MIKE BELOW ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTS AND AVAILABLE ON THE PHONE FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IF NECESSARY OUR KERRY BURNS STEEN AN ARCHITECT AND STEVEN WEINBERG AND NOT A COPYRIGHT ATTORNEY. MANAGER AT LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO THE WITNESSES IF THAT IS OKAY WITH YOU IT'S TERRIFIC WELCOME THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MIGHT PULL OUT ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTS CALIFORNIA. AND THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE AND AGAIN TO ANTON AND THE CHAIR TO WORKING WITH US ON THIS- JUST A COUPLE OF POINTS. I'LL BE VERY THIS IS ALL. A AND CATALOG TO THE EXIST LAW IN THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE ON- BUILDING DEPARTMENTS- WE WORKED WITH DOCTOR THE LEAGUE OF CITIES C. SACK- THE LEAGUE'S THE DOCUMENT THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS IS PARTICULARLY. INSTRUCTIVE BECAUSE WE ARE ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WITH THE WAY THEY DESCRIBE THE PROCESS FOR THE BUILDING LAW. AND THEY SAY THE OFFICIAL COPY OF BUILDING PLANS MAINTAINED BY LOCAL AGENCIES BUILDING DEPARTMENT MAY BE INSPECTED BUT CANNOT BE COPIED WITHOUT THE LOCAL AGENCY FIRST REQUESTING THE WRITTEN PERMISSION. OF THE PROFESSIONAL WHO SIGNED THE DOCUMENT. AND THE PROPERTY HOLDER SO WE'VE WE'VE BUILT THIS OFF OF THE- BUILDING DEPARTMENT NOW IT IS TRUE THAT THE FUNCTIONS OF THE BUILDING DEPARTMENT AND THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT ARE DIFFERENT. BUT THIS BALANCE BETWEEN THE COPYRIGHT PROTECTION UNDER THE FEDERAL COPYRIGHT ACT IN THE PUBLIC'S NEED TO GO TO SEE THE DOCUMENTS AND FIND OUT WHAT'S- PROPOSED TO A GIRL IN. A TO THE PROPERTY IS BEING MAINTAINED WE WITH THE HELP OF THE PUBLIC WILL HAVE FULL ACCESS ON PREMISES. IN DURING ANY MEETING OF THE- PLANNING AGENCY. THE PROBLEM THOUGH IS THE REMEDY THE EXISTING REMEDY OF A COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT LAWSUIT IS NOT GREAT. THE WE SHOULD NEVER ENCOURAGE LAWSUITS ON THIS KIND OF THING AFTER ALL THE BUILDING WILL ALREADY EXIST SO IT'S HARD TO AND BUILD A BUILDING. SO WE THINK WE'VE GOT A GOOD BALANCE HERE AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY. QUESTIONS BUT WOULD ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE IN ROOM TWENTY TWO HUNDRED THAT WOULD LIKE TO- SUPPORT THE BILL. SEEING NONE WILL MOVE ON TO DO YOU HAVE A SECOND WITNESS IF YOU'D LIKE TO WRITE ARE ONLY FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES EXPERTS AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS THAT'S GREAT ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT I APPRECIATE IT I WILL MOVE ON TO THE TELECONFERENCE LINE IS OR ANYBODY THAT WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF S. B. TWELVE FOURTEEN. THANK YOU IF YOU WEREN'T PART OF. E. TWELFTH FOURTEEN YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. AGAIN THAT IS ONE AND THEN IF YOU'RE TO PART OF AT E. TWELFTH FORTY. AND MEDICARE WE HAVE NOTS PARTICULAR STUDY VERY GOOD WILL MOVE ON TO OPPOSITION IS OR ANYBODY IN ROOM AT TWENTY TWO HUNDRED THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL ON THE TELECONFERENCE LANE THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF S. B. TWELVE FORTY. THANK YOU FOR IN OPPOSITION AT EIGHT TWELVE FOURTEEN YOU MAY PRESS ONE. BUTTON ZERO. AGAIN THAT IS ONE NINE ZERO IF YOU'RE IN OPPOSITION UP AT E. TWELFTH. FOURTEEN AMATEUR WE HAVE NO OPPOSITION IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME VERY GOOD TO ME BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS. THE BILL. THERE IS A MOTION CENTERED RAZA. YES I HAVE- COUPLE QUESTIONS TAB HELP ME UNDERSTAND- WHAT KIND OF STOOD OUT FOR ME IS. THAT IT DOESN'T APPEAR FROM THE ANALYSIS IS THAT THERE'S A BIG PROBLEM- AND SO I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND ONE ONE EXAMPLE WAS GIVEN- AND LITTLE REMARKS THE COMMENTS ARE MADE OF YEAH WE LOOKING FOR A PROBLEM HERE- AND THERE'S NOT REALLY A PROBLEM SO WE'RE LOOKING WHAT ARE WE LOOKING TO SOLVE WHAT IS REALLY AT STAKE HERE OR NOT I KNOW WHAT'S AT STAKE AS FAR AS THE PUBLIC RIGHT WE WANT THE PUBLIC TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THESE DOCUMENTS SO. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM I YOU KNOW I THINK I AGREE WITH YOU IT'S PROBABLY A MINOR PROBLEM AND IT'S LIMITED- YOU KNOW TOWARD X. WHERE THEIR EXPOSURE IS ACROSS THE STATE ONE OF THE THINGS WHEN I FIRST GOT ALL OF MY BROTHER'S A HOME BUILDER MY DAD'S A HOME BUILDER WHEN I FIRST GOT ELECTED TO THE CITY COUNCIL IN TWO THOUSAND TWO AND- THIS WAS ALWAYS PECULIAR TO ME THAT. THESE PLANS WOULD COME IN ORDER THE CITY COUNCIL AND- EVERYTHING WAS THERE. YOU KNOW- THAT THE ARCHITECTS HAVE BEEN PAID TO DO AND- PUT ON PAPER AND AVAILABLE TO YOU KNOW. A DOWN TO THE VERY DETAIL- FOR THE PUBLIC'S REVIEW AND THEN. I ALWAYS KIND OF HAD THIS CONCEPT OF. IT THAT'S EXPOSED YOU KNOW FOR THEIR COMPETITION TO HAVE ACCESS TO IT SO I THOUGHT THAT WAS PECULIAR AND THEN. YOU KNOW. OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T THINK MUCH OF IT AFTER THAT BUT THIS CAME TO US THIS YEAR. I THINK THE- IT IS LIMITED THE EXPOSURE IS. LIMITED TO IF YOU KNOW IF YOU PROFESSIONALS IN THE STATE BUT- I THINK AS- AS POLICYMAKERS- WE WANT TO ALIGN. THE STATE POLICY WITH THE FEDERAL- POLICY TO PREVENT THESE LAWSUITS- THAT DOES EXTEND. IT JUST.GREAT A SITUATION WHERE WE'RE PUTTING THINGS INTO THE COURTS I THINK THAT CAN BE SOLVED HERE TODAY- IN ADDITION TO THAT IF MR BELOW HAS SOME ADDITIONAL COMMENTS SAID. LIKE FOR HIM TO ADD ON TO THAT THROUGH CHAIR VENTURE. YES OKAY THANK YOU I'M SORRY I THINK IT'S A VERY FAIR QUESTION SENATOR DORADO THE ASSOCIATION HAS PASSED FOR EXAMPLES WE'VE HAD PEOPLE FRANKLY KIND OF SHEEPISHLY ADMIT YES WE HAVE DONE THAT OURSELVES WHERE WHERE OF CONTRACTORS HAVING DONE IT IT'S KIND OF A SOMETHING THAT NO ONE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT AND YOU DON'T WANT TO NAME NAMES. BUT IF YOU TAKE THE ARCHITECT'S DRAWINGS FOR DESIGN REFERENCE AND THEY ADMIT THAT IT'S HAPPENING- THAT IS A COPYRIGHT VIOLATION AND IF THEY'RE JUST LEFT OUT IN THE OPEN PERMANENTLY THEN WE'RE FACILITATING THAT SO WE'D LIKE TO. YOU KNOW GET AHEAD OF IT. LAY OUT THE RULES CONSISTENT WITH THE BUILDING DEPARTMENT AND PREVENT LAWSUITS THAT. ANY OTHER QUESTION CENTER DRAWS A. YEAH I THOUGHT SO IT MAYBE IT IS RIGHT I DON'T SEE THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM OTHER THAN MAYBE SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE KIND OF SITUATION SO. WHY DO WE WANT TO TAKE THAT THE SIDES YOU KNOW WITH THE PUBLIC HAVING ACCESS WHEN IT HASN'T BEEN A PROBLEM I AND I THINK TO MR BALOCH POINT THERE HAVE BEEN SITUATIONS WHERE AT HAS ALREADY HAPPENED AND AGAIN. A SMALL AND VERY LIMITED- SO IT IS A SMALL PROBLEM IN A VERY LIMITED PROBLEM THAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIX HERE TODAY. YES SENATOR ALSO IF I COULD IF I COULD- I MEAN I HAD THE SAME ISSUE IT WHEN WE SAT DOWN HAD A CONVERSATION I THINK WHAT WAS. WHAT CONVINCED ME IS THAT- AND I SAT ON A PLANNING COMMISSION AND ALSO ON THE CITY COUNCIL. AND I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THOSE BOARDS AND BODIES HAVING THE DOCUMENTS THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO ANALYZE NEW PROJECTS IN THEIR IN THEIR COMMUNITY. AND THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAVING THE DETAILED. PLANNING DOCUMENTS THAT CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS IF YOU WILL- THAT TELL YOU- DOWN TO THE TO THE- TO THE INCH LEVEL WHAT WHAT SHE NEEDS TO GO WHERE RIGHT- IT THERE IS THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT AND SITE PLANS AND MASSING DOT DIAGRAMS MASSING DIAGRAMS TO SHOW YOU HOW BIG THE BUILDING IS AND WHAT IT% LOOKS LIKE. AND THAT THE SITE PLANS TELL YOU THE SET BACKS AND ALL THAT KINDA STUFF IN OTHER WORDS YOU DON'T NEED THE LEVEL OF DETAIL THAT THE- BUILDING DOCUMENTS. WOULD GIVE YOU. BUT IF YOU WANT THAT YOU CAN GO INTO THE INTO THE- INTO THE BUILDING. OFFICIALS OFFICE TAKE A LOOK AT IT. AND IF THE ARCHITECTS GIVES APPROVAL YOU CAN GET A COPY OF IT. AS A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC SO THE IDEA IS THAT YOU GET. YOU GET WHAT YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO TELL WHAT THE BUILDINGS GOING TO LOOK LIKE- ALL OF THAT IS AVAILABLE BUT THAT CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS ARE THOSE ARE WITH WEATHER BEING AND IF I. IF I'VE GOT IT WRONG PLEASE. PLEASE INVENT AND FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IF IT'S ALREADY FEDERAL LINE IT'S PREEMPTED IN YOU CAN'T GET THOSE YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE GETTING THOSE DOCUMENTS THEN- WE JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RIGHT HANDLES WITH THE LEFT HAND IS DOING AND MAKE IT VERY CLEAR. IN IN- IN THE CODE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT SO FOR THAT REASON I'M GOING TO SUPPORT IT. SUPPORTED TODAY- AND- THE MOTION HAS BEEN MADE. THAT SOMEBODY MAKE MARGIN OKAY. CENTER HERTZBERG MADE THE MOTION. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. BUT I GUESS NOW. WANNA MAKE THE COMMENT I'M- I'M UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE I DON'T SEE. AN IMBALANCE. IN TERMS OF WHAT'S- WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR AND WHAT THE PROBLEM IS. I WILL TODAY SUPPORT BUT I. NEED TO HAVE MORE CONVERSATION TO MAKE A REAL COMMITMENT THANK YOU. WE WILL HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS VERY GOOD IT AND IT MIGHT BE GOOD JUST TO TAKE THE DIFFERENT DOCUMENTS SO YOU GET THIS AT A CHANCE TO SEE WHAT THE DIFFERENCES AND- WHAT WHAT YOU'RE WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THIS BILL SO I DO APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND- THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED BUT FIRST TO BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL SENATOR COLORADO HI CABALLERO I SENATOR NIELSEN HI NIELSEN HI SENATOR DORADO ZERO ZERO HI SENATOR HERTZBERG BY HERTZBERG HI SENATOR WIENER. WIENER HI. FIVE ZERO.

WELCOME AND I WANNA THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JUMP IN FRONT OF YOU ABSOLUTELY HE'S ALWAYS A GENTLEMAN WHY WOULDN'T WE- OF THE THIRTY FIRST TIME IN THIS COMMITTEE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WELCOME. THANK YOU. VERY VERY EXCITED TO BE HERE- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT SENATE BILL THIRTEEN TWELVE THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS MEASURE AND WILL BE TAKING THE AMENDMENTS. AS PROPOSED. SB THIRTEEN TWELVE SIX TO HARMONIZE CALIFORNIA'S MARKETPLACE FACILITATOR LAW WITH CURRENT PRACTICE BY CLEARLY IDENTIFYING THE MARKETPLACE SELLER AS A TAX RESPONSIBLE PARTY AND CAR RENTAL TRANSACTIONS. FACILITATED BY AN ONLINE TRAVEL COMPANY. MANY STATES HAVE ADOPTED MARKETPLACE FACILITATOR LAWS GOVERNING SALES USE TAX REMITTANCE OBLIGATIONS WHEN BUSINESS TAXPAYERS PARTNER TO SELL GOODS AND OR SERVICES THROUGH THIRD PARTY. INTERMEDIARIES CAR RENTAL CUSTOMERS ALSO FREQUENTLY MODIFY THEIR BOOKINGS AT THE COUNTER WHICH CAN DRASTICALLY CHANGE THE TAXES AND OTHER CHARGES THAT APPLY TO THE RENTAL. THESE RESULT IN THERE BEING MULTIPLE RETAILERS FOR DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF A SINGLE CAR RENTAL BOOKING. FURTHER COMPLICATING THE TAX COLLECTION AND REMITTANCE REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE NEW MARKETPLACE COMPANIES DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO COMPLETE AND SUFFICIENT INFORMATION NECESSARY TO ACCURATELY COMPUTE THE TAXES DUE FOR CAR RENTAL BOOKINGS. RENTAL CAR COMPANIES HAVE PHYSICAL PRESENCE IN CALIFORNIA AND THE TRANSACTION IS PRIMARILY TAKING PLACE IN THE RENTAL CAR COMPANY'S PHYSICAL LOCATION. THESE COMPANIES HAVE DEEP INDUSTRY KNOWLEDGE COMPLETE INFORMATION ABOUT THE TRANSACTION AND ARE UNDER PERPETUAL AUDIT WITH THE CD TFA RESPONSIBILITY TO PLATFORMS WHO WILL WHO ARE ILL EQUIPPED TO NAVIGATE COMPLEXITIES ONLY LEADS TO CONFUSION FOR THE PLATFORM. THE RENTAL CAR COMPANY AND THE CD TFA ODD AUDITORS. RENTAL CAR COMPANIES ARE ALREADY REMITTING TAX AND THESE TRANSACTIONS AND ARE UNDER CONTINUOUS AUDIT BY THE CD TFA. SB THIRTEEN TWELVE WILL CLEARLY IDENTIFY THE MARKETPLACE SELLER AS A TAX RESPONSIBLE PARTY IN CAR RENTAL TRANSACTIONS. THROUGH CREATING MORE TRANSPARENCY IN THE PROCESS CAR RENTAL GROUPS AS WELL AS THE STATE AUDITOR'S WILL OPERATE WITHIN A MORE CLEARLY DEFINED TAXATION SYSTEM. JOINING ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT AND TO HELP ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS IS ALYSSA STINSON AND STEPHANIE GILL FEATHER ON BEHALF OF OUR BILL SPONSOR EXPEDIA GROUP. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. ABOUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CALL YOUR FIRST. WITNESS BOTH OF THEM I UNDERSTAND ARE ON THE PHONE. SO WE'LL START WITH ALYSSA STINSON. MADAME MODERATOR IF YOU COULD OPEN HER LINE.

CALIFORNIA THE FAMILY OF TRY BRANDS INCLUDING EXPEDIA DOT COM ORBITZ HOTWIRE TRAVELOCITY ANYMORE. I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT SENATE BILL THIRTEEN TWELVE. I'VE BEEN UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND I THINK THIRTEEN TWELVE WILL SIMPLY HARMONIZED CALIFORNIA EIGHT O'CLOCK I DON'T THINK IT LOT WITH CURRENT PRACTICE. I CLEARLY IDENTIFY THE FACT OF PARTY FOR ALL CAR RENTAL TRAIN. FACILITATED BY ONLINE TRAVEL COMPANY. I'VE BEEN UNEXPECTED RESULT OF THE MARKETS THAT FACILITATE OUR LAW- POINT EIGHTEEN. THAT THESE UNIQUE SITUATION BOTH- ONLINE TRAVEL COMPANIES AND CAR RENTAL COMPANIES ARE CONSIDERED THE FACT ON A PARTY FOR THE FANS TRANSACTION. IF FIGHT YOUNG MY TRAVEL COMPANY NOT HAVING ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION THAT VARY ADEQUATELY REMAIN. ACT I'M NOT LOOKING. ALSO IT IS ADVANCED AND FISH FIVE SIX FAR ABOUT THE TRAVEL. FROM ARM FROM THEIR MARKET. ARE LOCKED. MAKING RENTAL CAR. AND INCLUDING MISSOURI AND- IN WASHINGTON NEW YORK SPECIFICALLY. OUR TEAM WORKS AT THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO EXPLAIN THE COMPLEX THAT THE ISSUE AND THE ULTIMATELY. SIMILAR TENSIONS ONE BEING CAN. OUT THAT WOULD BE BECAUSE OF THE COMP OF RENTAL CUSTOMERS BECAUSE MODIFYING THEIR **** ACCOUNT. MY UNINSTALL COMPANIES LIKE A GROUP HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE CHANGES ARE UNABLE TO THE ACCOUNT AND THEN IMPROPERLY ACTIVE. WHICH RESULTS IN BEING YOU CAN. VERY DIFFERENT COMPOUND- OF THINGS ALL RIGHT FOR CAR PARKING SIX FIVE I'M NOT. COMPLEXITY FOR THE STATE. OF OUR COMPANY AND THAT'S THE- ONLINE TRAVEL. FROM LIABILITY LEAVE OR REMAIN IN THE RENTAL COMPANY FOR ALREADY IF ALL OF PERMITTING FACT AND YOU A WITH NO ISSUE OF MATERIAL FACT LEAKAGE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. IN AMES AND FEDERATION OF SB THIRTEEN FILED WITH ME ON THE LINE AS YOU GROUP'S RECORD FACT ACTUALLY GO EITHER ANSWER ANY. QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE YEAH. VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IS THERE ANY IN TO TWO HUNDRED THAT WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF. THIS BILL. SEEING NO MOVEMENT WILL MOVE ON TO THE TELECONFERENCE LINE BETTER MODERATOR CAN YOU Q. OF AYBODY THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF S. B. THIRTEEN TWELVE THIRTEEN TWELVE YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. AGAIN THAT ONE AND THEN THEY'RE UP THERE IN PART AT THE THIRTEENTH TWELVE. AND MEDICARE WE HAVE NO ONE IN SUPPORT OF Q. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL MOVE ON TO OPPOSITION IS THERE ANYBODY IN ROOM TWENTY TWO HUNDRED THAT WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OF THIRTEEN TWELVE.

VERY GOOD WILL BRING THE- THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THAT- COMMITTEE MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO MAKE CENTER DRIVE SOUTH. YEAH- THE PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH OF THESE NEW INNOVATIVE WAYS OF. DOING THINGS ONLINE IS IT CREATES THESE ISSUES. AND THEY WERE SORT OF STUCK TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT AND SORTED OUT- SO THAT'S JUST THE FIRST THING THAT ALWAYS HITS ME AS- IT MOVES FORWARD. EXPEDIA OTHER COMPANIES I USE- WHATEVER WE'LL USE THEM BUT- IT CREATES SOME PROBLEMS HERE AND THEN WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO. MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T CAUSE- ISSUES OF I UNDERSTAND WITH REGARDS TO THE STATE THAT THE COLLECTION OF TAXES WILL NOT BE. BUT IMPACTED. OKAY IF ANYTHING PLAYING THAT SURE IF ANYTHING I THINK IT WILL BE MORE ACCURATE BECAUSE SOMETIMES WHEN THERE'S CHANGES. THE PLATFORMS ARE NOT AWARE OF THESE CHANGES SO THEY CAN'T AND EVERY STATE BEING DIFFERENT WITH THE CHANGES FROM THE CONSUMER MIGHT CREATE SOME DISCREPANCIES AND WHAT IS COLLECTED WHAT IS NOT WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEBODY DIRECTLY. IN STATE THAT KNOWS WHAT THE CURRENT AMOUNTS ARE IN THE KNOW WHAT THE CHANGES ARE TO THE LOCAL BOOKINGS THEN THEY CAN HAVE A MORE ACCURATE COLLECTION OF THE TAXES AND IN THIS CASE SO I THINK IF ANYTHING IT ALLOWS FOR MORE TRANSPARENCY MORE ACCURACY IN ASK RECEIVING NOT US BUT I'M- THE- CITY TFA. RECEIVING THE- THE TAXES THAT ARE NECESSARY- I DIDN'T SEE I DIDN'T SEE- ANY KIND OF- COMMENTS FROM THE CAR RENTAL COMPANIES CAN YOU TELL ME SURE THEY HAVE A POSITION- SO NO OPPOSITION WE'VE ACTUALLY WE HAD ACTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DIFFERENT- CAR RENTAL COMPANIES THERE'S AVIS HERTZ- THERE WAS ONE OTHER A COMPANY THAT WE ACTUALLY GOT WAS A WE HAD A VARIETY OF- RENTAL COMPANY RENTAL CAR COMPANIES THAT WE ACTUALLY ENGAGE WITH TO MAKE SURE AND THEY ACTUALLY WERE VERY ACTIVE AND ENGAGED IN DRAFTING THE LANGUAGE FOR THE BILL. SO WHAT IS THERE IS THERE OFFICIAL POSITION IN SUPPORT OR IS IT WELL IF WHAT IS THERE I AM GOING TO ASSUME THAT IT IS IN SUPPORT BECAUSE THEY WERE IT IT OUT AT THE TABLE DRAFTING THE LANGUAGE- IS. ANYONE ON ON THE PHONE WOULD LIKE TO. LIVE WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THAT BUT- I'M GOING TO ASSUME THAT IF YOU'RE ENGAGED IN THE CONVERSATIONS AND YOU ARE HELPING DRAFT THE LANGUAGE THA THEY WILL BE AN ABSOLUTE SUPPORT.

IT IS THEN THE ESCALATORS RESPONSIBILITY TO DETERMINE THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE FACILITIES AND AVOID DAMAGING THEM. EIGHT TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN FEDERAL REPORT PRODUCED BY THE PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY ADMINISTRATION GAVE CALIFORNIA A LOWER GRADE BECAUSE OF THE TWO NOTIFICATION CENTERS DO NOT CURRENTLY INCLUDE CALTRANS. WHO OPERATE RELATIVELY FEW SUB SERVICE INFRASTRUCTURES WITHIN THE ADJACENT. TO ITS RIGHT OF WAYS THE REPORT ALSO CITED THE EXCLUSION OF NON PRESSURIZED SEWER LINES OR STORM DRAINS AS A REASON FOR THE LOWER ASSESSMENT. THIS BILL SEEKS TO REMEDY BOTH OF THESE DEFICIENCIES ADDITIONALLY THE CALIFORNIA COMMON GROUND ALLEGIANCE ALLIANCE I'M SORRY ALLIANCE THE STATE CHAPTER OF A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO EXCAVATION SAFETY CONSISTING OF UTILITIES UTILITY LOCATING COMPANIES AND EXCAVATORS. IDENTIFIED SEVERAL ADDITIONAL SHORTCOMINGS WITH CALIFORNIA'S EIGHT ONE ONE LAW AND THOSE ARE THE FUNCTIONAL AND KILLER FINE ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THIS BILL. I WANTED TO THANK THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION SANITATION AGENCIES FOR THE INFORMATIVE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD SO FAR. WELL WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO REACH A COMPROMISE YET I'M OPEN TO FURTHER CONVERSATIONS JOINING ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT AND TO HELP TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS IS TODD BLUMSTEIN ON BEHALF OF THE SPONSOR THE UNDERGROUND SERVICE ALERT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE ALERT AND JAMES WINGATEON BEHALF OF USA NORTH. EIGHT ONE ONE- AGAIN WELCOME THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I ALSO LIKE TO RECOGNISE ANTON IN THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR THOUGHTFUL ENGAGEMENT ON THIS BILL- TAUGHT BLUESTEIN BEHALF THE SPONSOR THE UNDERGROUND SERVICE ALERT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- DEKLERK'S. I ALSO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION AS WELL SB THIRTEEN FORTY FIVE AMENDS THE CALL BEFORE YOU DIG LAW IS A FREE SERVICE FOR ANY PERSON OR COMPANY. PLANNING TO DIG INTO THE GROUND THE SERVICE REQUIRES MOST UTILITIES TO LOCATE AND MARK BEER UNDERGROUND UTILITIES IN ORDER FOR THE PERSON OR COMPANY EXCAVATING TO DO SO SAFELY AROUND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS UNDERGROUND UTILITIES. ARTICULAR DILLER REPORTS A SUCCESS RATE OF 99% AND AVOIDING UNDERGROUND UTILITIES FOR THOSE THAT USE THE SERVICE. SB THIRTEEN FORTY FIVE ORIGINATED FROM AN INDUSTRY WORKING GROUP CALLED CARGA THE CALIFORNIA REGIONAL COMMON GROUND IT'S ALREADY COURTED CONSISTS OF UTILITY COMPANIES EXCAVATORS AND COMPANIES THAT LOCATE AND MARK UNDERGROUND UTILITIES. SB THIRTEEN FORTY FIVE AS PRIMARILY A TECHNICAL BILL DEVELOP BY CARTER. CARGAS INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES. THE BILL DOES EXPAND THE SERVICE TO GRAVITY DRIVEN SEWER LINES AND OTHER SIMILAR INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAVE MET WITH THE SEWER DISTRICT'S REPRESENTATIVE AND UNDERSTAND THEIR CONCERN WITH COSTS AND THEIR ABILITY TO. ACCURATELY LOCATE THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE- THE SIMPLE FACT IS THE CALIFORNIA WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER WESTERN STATES IS AN OUT LIAR WHEN IT COMES TO EXEMPTING UNDERGROUND UTILITIES FROM THE CALL BEFORE YOU DIG LAW. IT IS THE ONLY WESTERN STATE WITH STATUTORY EXEMPTIONS FOR SEWER STORM DRAINS AND OTHER GRAVITY DRIVEN UNDERGROUND LINES I WE'VE REVIEWED THE STATUTES IN WASHINGTON OREGON ARIZONA NEVADA UTAH AND IDAHO. AND THEY DO NOT PROVIDE ANY EXEMPTIONS FOR GRAVITY DRIVEN SEWER LINES A DEALER CARGO AND SCCA ALL BELIEVE EXCAVATORS SHOULD KNOW THE LOCATION OF POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS INFRASTRUCTURE BELOW THAT BELOW THE SURFACE- AND BEFORE THEY BEGIN EXCAVATING. I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR WINGATE- I BELIEVE HE IS ON THE PHONE- SO- MADAM MODERATOR IF YOU COULD OPEN. THE PHONE FOR MR WINGATE. MADAME MODERATOR YOU WITH US WE GET YOU KNOW I OF THE OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JAMES WINGATE I'M FROM UNDERGROUND SERVICE ALERT OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA NEVADA WHICH IS THE EIGHT ONE ONE CONTACT CENTER THAT HANDLES NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. YOU ALREADY IN MY LETTER OF SUPPORT IN YOUR PACKET FIREWALL FREE THAT DAY. BUT YOU'VE GOT A LONG LIST BUILDING I KNOW YOU'RE READY FOR LUNCH THIS ONE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ON YOUR AGENDA TODAY. BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE IT OPPOSITION FROM THE TO OUR COMPANY. BUT WHAT HAPPENED IS FOR DECADES THE SEWER COMPANIES HAVE BEEN EXEMPTED FROM PARTICIPATING AS A UTILITY OPERATOR LIKE THE REST OF THE UTILITY OPERATORS WHEN IT COMES TO MARKING. THEIR FACILITIES IN THE FIELD THEY CAN BE DAMAGED DURING EXCAVATION. SO THIS BILL IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO GET THEM TO PARTICIPATE BECAUSE DAMAGE IS TO HAPPEN TO THEIR FACILITY EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE DEEPER. THAN OTHER UTILITIES AS A GENERAL RULE BUT THEIR FACILITIES TO GET DAMAGED WE HAVE TEN OF THOUSANDS OF UTILITY LINE DAMAGES IN CALIFORNIA EVERY YEAR YOU HEARD THAT CORRECTLY TEN OF THOUSANDS. SO THE TOUR COMPANIES ARE GOING TO ARGUE THAT IT COSTS THEM MONEY AND TIME AND LABOR MARKET- FACILITIES IN THE FIELD THAT IS CORRECT IT WILL. BUT EVERY OTHER UTILITY OPERATOR ALREADY DOES THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE UTILITY- FOR THE SEWER INDUSTRY. I JOIN AND PARTICIPATE IN THE DAMAGE PREVENTION PROCESS ALL UTILITY OPERATORS HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO. WHEN THEY PUT THE PHILLIES IN THE GROUND TO KEEP TRACK OF THEM AND TO PROACTIVELY PROTECT THEM BY MARKING THEM. AND PARTICIPATING TO HELP ACTIVATORS DODD AND WHEN THEY'RE WORKING IN THE FIELD THIS BILL WILL REQUIRED TO OUR COMPANIES TO DO THE THING. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY. IS ANYONE ELSE IN THE ROOM AT TWO TWO. AT TWENTY TWO HIGH. THAT WOULD LIKE TO. SEEING NO MOVEMENT WILL MOVE ON TO THE- TELECONFERENCE LINE. MATTER MODERATOR IF YOU COULD OPEN TO THE PUBLIC. THEY WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF. THIRTEEN FORTY FIVE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THIRTEEN FORTY FIVE YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO B. THIRTEEN FORTY FIVE YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. AND WE WILL GO TO LINE THE SIXTY NINE YEAR LINE OF THE OPEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MET COMMITTEE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NEVADA CONFERENCE OF OPERATING ENGINEERS HERE DAN STRONG SUPPORT WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT PLEASE. THANK YOU MEDICARE WE HAVE NO FOR THIS IMPORTANT YOU AT THE TIME. VERY GOOD WE HAVE TO. LEAVE THE LEAD OPPOSITION WITNESSES MY DILLON WHO IS IN PERSON AND JASON I CARDS SO WE CAN START WITH WITH MY DAILY. WELCOME THANK YOU MADAM MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MY DILLON REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION SANITATION AGENCIES ALL THE MAJOR WASTE WATER AGENCIES IN THE STATE- AS YOU ANALYSIS MENTIONS IN SENATOR HAS MENTIONED. THAT FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS THE OWNERS AND OPERATORS OF NON PRESSURIZED SEWER LINES AND STORM DRAINS HAVE BEEN EXEMPT. FROM HAVING TO A MARK THESE LINES UP PRIOR TO AN EXCAVATION- THE REASON THAT THE LINES ARE TYPICALLY FIVE TO TWENTY FEET DEEP. AND IF IT WHICH IS RARE POSE NO DANGER TO THE EXCAVATOR OR THE PUBLIC THEM MR BLUM STYLE MENTION POTENTIAL DANGER BUT OUR FOLKS HAVE REALLY NOT SEEN. ANY DANGER YES A PROBLEM BUT NEVER A DANGER CASSAR WAS EXTENSIVELY INVOLVED IN THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN LEGISLATION BY SENATOR JERRY HILL AND THEN THAT. SITUATION WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING THE EXEMPTION CONTINUED- THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE AND SENATORS MENTION THAT- THE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN FEDERAL REPORT PRODUCED BY THE PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY ADMINISTRATION. CALIFORNIA WAS GIVEN THE LOWER ASSESSMENT- BECAUSE OF THE EXCLUSION OF THE NON PRESSURE SEWER LINES AND STORM DRAINS WE DO NOT RECALL THE ISSUE OF CALIFORNIA GETTING A LOWER ASSESSMENT EVER SURFACING DURING THE DEVELOPMENT OF SENATOR HILLS LEGISLATION IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN. YESTERDAY ONE OF OUR AGENCIES- FORWARDED A JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE LETTER FROM THE US DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY ADMINISTRATION- TO TONY MARINO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE SAFETY BOARD. THE LETTER SAYS BASED ON A TWENTY TWENTY VALUATION AND I QUOTE. IT'S BEEN MADE THAT CALIFORNIA- EXCAVATION DAMAGE. LAW IS ADEQUATE THE LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN THE LOWER ASSESSMENT OUT TO BE COMPLETELY FACTUAL WITH THE COMMITTEE- THE LETTER DOES SAY FOR ALL CATEGORIES WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT THERE'S NOT ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENTS OF LESLIE- MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE CURRENT EXEMPTION IS ELIMINATED IN THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE. THE COST TO CITIES COUNTIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS TO MARK THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF MILES OF NON PRESSURIZED SEWER LINES IN NON PRESSURIZED STORM DRAINS IT POSE LITTLE OR NO DANGER WOULD BE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS NOW THE ONE OF THE WITNESSES JUST MENTION THAT THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF. PRESUMABLY HE MEANT SEWER LINES BEING HIT JUST TO PUT IN PERSPECTIVE L. A. COUNTY SANITATION DISTRICT SERVES EIGHTY TWO CITIES. AND FIVE AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE THEY HAVE FORTY SIX HUNDRED MILES A SKINNY SIX FOURTEEN HUNDRED MILES OF NOT PRESSURIZE LINES SIXTY MILES A PRESSURIZED WHICH INDEED ARE MARKED. BUT THEY SAY THEY HAVE ONE OR TWO HITS TO THEIR NINE PRESSURIZE LINES A YEAR SO THAT'S A MAJOR AGENCY THAT SAYS A GENERALLY HAVE ONE OR TWO HITS A YEAR SO WE THINK THE NUMBERS QUITE LOW AND WOULD ARGUE THEY'RE CERTAINLY NOT IN THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS USING. JASON I COULD WITH ADULTS DEAN GILBERT ROBESON SMITH ON BEHALF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SANITATION DISTRICTS MISTER DILLON ACTUALLY JUST MENTIONED A LOT OF THE STATISTICS THAT THAT I WAS GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU SO I WON'T I WON'T BELABOR THEM BUT BUT I DID WANT TO MAKE A POINT BASED ON SOMETHING THAT THE PROPONENTS SAID WHICH- THE REFERENCE WAS MADE SEVERAL TIMES TO SEWER COMPANIES L. A. C. S. D. AND THE CITY IS THAT IT SERVES OUR OUR OUR LOCAL AGENCIES WHICH MEANS THAT. THE COST OF LOCATING AND MARKING THOSE FOURTEEN HUNDRED MILES OF LINES WHICH ARE MOSTLY YOU KNOW 9295% NON PRESSURIZE LINES ARE GONNA BE MEASURED IN THE MILLIONS THAT'S NOT GOING TO COME OUT OF IT A COMPANIES PROFIT MARGIN THAT'S GONNA COME OUT OF A LOCAL RATEPAYERS POCKETS. M. AND YOU HAVE TO BALANCE THAT COST AGAINST THE POTENTIAL RISK OF ACTUALLY STRIKING ONE OF THOSE LINES IS MISTER DILLON LAID OUT CORRECTLY OUR LINES TEND TO BE DEEPER THAT WAS ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE PROPONENTS AS WELL YOU KNOW IN THE ONE TO TWO HITS THAT WE HAVE A YEAR- YOU KNOW WE HAVE NO EXPERIENCE WITH SEWAGE RUNNING OFF OF AN EXCAVATION SITE AND YOU KNOW AS MR DON'T SAID WE WOULD ALSO QUESTION THIS THIS NOTION THAT THERE ARE TEN THOUSAND LINE HITS WHEN AGAIN WE'RE- WE'RE RELATIVELY LARGE. SANITATION AGENCY AND WE'RE EXPERIENCING ONE TO TWO A YEAR- SO AT THE END OF THE DAY MEMBERS YOU KNOW WE UNFORTUNATELY HAVE TO BE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED THIS BILL UNLESS THEEXEMPTION IS REINSTATED YOU KNOW THE RISK IT IS HERE HAS TO BE EVALUATED AGAINST THE POTENTIAL COSTS AND WE THINK THE RISK IS VERY LOW THE COST IS RELATIVELY HIGH. THE LAST POINT I WOULD MAKE IS THAT FOR FROM FROM LA CSTS PERSPECTIVE THERE OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE BILL THAT GENERALLY SHIFT LIABILITY FROM EXCAVATORS ON TO LOCAL PUBLIC AGENCIES ONE EXAMPLE WOULD BE UNDER CURRENT LAW L. A. CST HAS THE AUTHORITY NOT TO LOCATE AND MARK WHEN AN EXCAVATION SITE IS NOT CLEARLY DELINEATED. THAT MAKES SENSE IT HOULD NOT BE A GUESSING GAME WHERE'S WORK IS GOING TO BE PERFORMED BUT AS THIS BILL AS WRITTEN- WE NO LONGER HAVE THAT ABILITY WITH THE ONUS WOULD BE. ON US TO FOLLOW UP WITH EXCAVATORS AND AGAIN TRY. TO MAKE OUR BEST. ABOUT WHERE WORK IS GOING TO BE PERFORMED. SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS WE HAVE TO BE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL TODAY AND- WE ARE RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN ROOM TWENTY TWO HUNDRED THAT WOULD LIKE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TESTIMONY. THING THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO THAT- TELECONFERENCE LINE. MATTER MODERATOR IF YOU COULD ASK IF THERE IS ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO. TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO SB THIRTEEN FORTY FIVE. THANK YOU HERE IN OPPOSITION UP AT EIGHT THIRTEEN FORTY FIVE YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. AGAIN THAT IS ONE AND THEN THEREAFTER IN OPPOSITION OF S. E. THIRTEEN FORTY FIVE. AND MY MOMENT WE COULD HAVE ONE LINE THANK YOU. THIS REMINDER RERUN OPPOSITION UP AT HE. THIRTEEN FORTY FIVE. WE WILL GO LINE FIFTY ONE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN NAME IS THOMAS WENT THERE AND I AM REPRESENTING REGIONAL SAND AND WE CURRENTLY OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE THANK YOU. AND MEDICARE WE HAVE NO FURTHER OPPOSITION QUEUE AT THIS TIME VERY GOOD- WILL BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. SENATE SENATOR. WE MADE PROGRESS IN YOUR WINNER THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I THANK YOU FOR THOSE LEGISLATION I'M GONNA SUPPORT IT TODAY- BUT I'M DOING SO WITH SOME HESITATION I THINK SOME OF THE- CONCERNS RAISED BY OPPONENTS I HOPE YOU'RE CONTINUING TO WORK. WITH AND I KNOW THE SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WHICH IS A- A PUBLIC AGENCY THAT YOU KNOW DOES A TERRIFIC JOB. MANAGING THE SEWER SYSTEMS AND THE WATER SYSTEM AND A POWER SYSTEM IN SAN FRANCISCO I'M SURE THOSE CONCERNS AND- AND THAT'S AN AGENCY THAT'S VERY FOCUSED ON ON SAFETY SO- WERE YOU. WHERE YOU. WORK WITH THE A POINT AND WE ARE AND IF I MAY I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SOME. THAT WE WOULD WORK AND INTENDED THAT MIGHT WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S CONVEYED CLEARLY WHAT THE INTENT OF THE BILL IS. THE SIZE IDENTIFICATION SO- WITH REGARDS TO THE NOTION THAT IT'S NOT EASE A SAFETY CONCERN WITH THE SEWER LINES I HAVE TO BEG TO DIFFER. AS YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IF THERE'S A SEWAGE LEAK IF THERE'S AN ACCIDENT THAT THAT CAN CONTAMINATE OUR WATER SOURCES TO AND OUR LINES TO THAT ACTUALLY COULD CREATE A BIGGER PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS OUR WATER. AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT IT ALSO COULD IT COULD AFFECT THE IMPACT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY SKV EXPOSED THE SEWAGE WATER IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY PEOPLE DON'T GO AROUND. AND RECOMMEND GOING AROUND IN THE IN THE COMPLICATIONS THAT WE HAVE WHEN WE HAVE- DISASTERS AND YOU HAVE ALL THE LINES ARE BROKEN IN IN WATER IN TO DATE IN THE SWITCH BEING CONTAMINATED THERE SO THERE IS A SAFETY CONCERN WITHOUT REGARD. NUMBER TWO. I COME FROM LOCAL- AS AN LOCAL CONTROL ADVOCATE IN SO I'M VERY VERY SENSITIVE TO OUR LOCAL DISTRICTS AND A SPECIAL SPECIAL. SPECIAL DISTRICTS WITH WATER AND SEWER OURS IT COMBINED. IN MY OWN CITY SO I A- I A VERY COGNISANT OF THE CONCERNS IN THE IN THE- THE CONCERNS IN THE- IN THE RATIONALE BEHIND WHY THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE EXCLUDED HOWEVER I. WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS BILL IN THE BILL'S INTENT IS TO JUST IDENTIFY NOT ALL THE FOURTEEN HUNDRED. FOURTEEN HUNDRED MILES THAT THEY HAVE IN LINE OR PER SE IN IN THIS PARTICULAR DISTRICT BUT ONLY WHEN AND ASK NECESSARY WHEN THE EXCAVATION IS HAPPENING THAT IS THE ONLY TIME THAT THERE. REQUIRED TO COME AND LOOK TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE THE A DENTIST BY WHERE THE SEWER LINES ARE. NOW WHEN THE COST THAT WOULD NOT WE DON'T EXPECTING TO PREEMPTIVELY AB IDENTIFY ALL OF THE LINES SOME OF WHICH COULD BE DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY BECAUSE OF THE AGE. AT THEIR BEEN AROUND AND I GET THAT HOWEVER ONLY WHEN AND IF NECESSARY- ACTUALLY WIN BECAUSE IT WILL BE NECESSARY WHEN THE EXCAVATION SO IT'S VERY LIMITED IN SCOPE. AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE COST IF THERE'S EVER DAMAGE TO ANY OF THESE LINES. THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE ARE THE EXCAVATORS. AND THEY CAN COST ANYWHERE DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF DAMAGE AS LITTLE AS FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. COULD BE MORE. IN THE ESCALATORS HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO PAY THAT THEY'RE THE RESPONSIBLE THERE'S NOBODY ELSE RESPONSIBLE EXCEPT FOR THAT. SO WHEN IT COMES TO DOING OUR JOB SPECIALLY IF- THE WATER DISTRICT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR FOR MAINTAINING AND LOOKING AFTER THEIR THEIR THEIR LINES. THE SEWER DISTRICT SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE JUST AS MUCH- SO I JUST WANTED TO ADDRESS THOSE THOSE. THOSE POINTS THAT WERE MADE EARLIER- I THINK IT ALL OF THEM. BUT SEE SAFETY AND WHAT I WHAT I WHAT I HEARD SENATOR WIENER ASK IS WHETHER YOU'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION WE WILL ALWAYS CONTINUE I AM A HUGE ADVOCATE. YEAH I FEEL I FEEL IT'S JUST WHATEVER I DON'T KNOW AND AGAIN I'M AN AUTHOR TO OUR AND DIFFERENT PEOPLE SAY DIFFERENT THINGS BUT I JUST IT SOUNDS IT IS MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE BIT OF A BREAKDOWN IN COMMUNICATION I HOPE NOT BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN WE JUST HAD AN IN PERSON MEETING THIS WEEK- AND IT WE WILL CONTINUE HAVE A SAID THIS WEEK THAT WE MET IT WAS THE LAST WEEK WAS LAST WEEK. I'M SO WE MET IN PERSON HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS- AND I'M A HUGE ADVOCATE OF HAVING ALL STAKEHOLDERS AT THE TABLE IN ORDER TO HAVE BALANCED POLICY AND THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO MAKE SURE SOMETIMES NOT ALL THE INFORMATION IS CLEARLY CONVEYED SO THAT THIS IS WHY I FEEL IT'S COMPLETELY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I ADDRESS. THE SAFETY PART OF IT THE LINES THAT WE'RE NOT EXPECTING THEM TO IDENTIFY ALL OF THE LINES BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THE COSTS THAT WOULD HAVE COME ABOUT AND OF COURSE THAT THAT COST IS TAXPAYER MONEY SO WE WANT TO BE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE WHICH IS WHY. ONLY WHEN AND WHEN NECESSARY THAT'S IT THE START OF YOUR QUESTION. IS ONGOING TO CONTINUE WORKING ON YEAH ABSOLUTELY FOR THE BILL TODAY IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE THANK YOU ABSOLUTELY. CENTER DRESS YEAH I JUST WANT. THE AGREED- CENTER WIENER ABOUT. THESE ISSUES- AND IF YOU DO YOU AMOUNT OF WORK THAT IT WOULD TAKE. TO DO WHAT. THIS BILL CALLS FOR. AND IF YOU AGREE THAT IT'S ONLY ONE OR TWO. HITS I DON'T KNOW THIRTY YEAR HOWEVER BUT IT SEEMS SO MEN MINUSCULE. IS THERE A DISAGREEMENT OVER THAT OR ARE YOU IN AGREEMENT OVER THAT. THAT I'M- WELL OF COURSE IF YOU'RE TALKING TO STAKEHOLDERS THEY'RE THEY'RE EACH GOING TO HAVE THEIR- THEIR OWN PERSPECTIVE. MY PERSONAL RESEARCH AND I'LL AND I'LL LET YOU FOLKS BOTH SPEAK ON THEIR BEHALF. MY PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE IS THAT. WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. IN THIS AND WE'RE TRYING TO DO IT AS FAR AS AN AUTHOR. TRYING TO BE AS FAIR AS I CAN WITH ALL OF IT. TRY TO BE FAIR IN- BOTH HOW THE WORK IS EXPECTED. IN WHOSE ACCOUNTABLE. AND IN ORDER TO BE PREEMPTIVE TO THE COST THAT POTENTIALLY COULD COST. BOTH TO THE DISTRICTS AS WELL AS THE EXCAVATORS. IF WE ALL DO OUR JOB CORRECTLY AND IF WE ALL ARE TRANSPARENT IF ART DISTRICTS ARE DOING THEIR JOB. IF THE EXCAVATORS ARE DOING THEIR JOB. THEN THERE'S LESS COST ONE TO THE TAXPAYERS NUMBER TWO TO THE- TO THE TO THE ESCALATORS IN THE COMPANIES THEMSELVES. YEAH EVERYBODY IS JUST DOING THEIR OWN JOB. IN BRINGING THAT TOGETHER BUT I AM COGNISANT. AND I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT IT'S CLEAR. THAT IT'S NOT. EXPECTED IN THI BILL THAT. EVERYTHING IS IDENTIFIED. ONLY WHEN. THE EXCAVATION IS HAPPENING IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA THAT'S IT AND I APPRECIATE THAT. ARE YOU KNOW LAST YEAR I HAD A BILL ABOUT MAKING IT SAFER. FOR THE UTILITY WORKERS. WHO WHO. IN ONE CASE WAS SON KILLED. OFF BUT THAT WAS YOU KNOW- GAS. UP SO THAT THE- I KNOW I UNDERSTAND THE- HIBIGGER DANGER. OF BIGGER A SAFETY ISSUES AND I'M TO SEE THAT THE OPERATING. ARE SUPPORT OF ANY ENGAGE BUT IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE THAT- CAN BE SAID ABOUT YOU KNOW THIS THIS ISSUE OF. THE LEVEL OF A- DANGER. THAT EXISTS OUT THERE CAN BE HELPFUL. VERY GOOD I'M IT THIS IS NOT NECESSARY I THINK WE THINK PEOPLE ARE ARE MOVING TOWARDS- A SUPPORT ON THE BILL AND THE KEY HERE IS THAT SHE'LL CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH WITH THE OPPOSITION SO THAT THERE'S A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF YOU KNOW WHAT AMENDS MIGHT BE NECESSARY OR OR NOT IT'S A IT'S REALLY UP TO THE AUTHOR- DO WE HAVE A MOTION ON. THE BILL SENATOR NIELSEN. AND I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU. MOVE THE BILL- YOU MAY CONCLUDE. THIS BILL WILL INCREASE THE SAFETY OF EXCAVATORS ARE WHO NEED TO DIG IN AREAS THAT CONTAINS OF SERVICE INSTALLATIONS IN JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY FOR EVERYONE THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SO MUCH THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED BUT FIRST AMEND AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS PLEASE CALL THE ROLL SENATOR CAMBIADO I FELT BIRO HI SENATOR NIELSEN. NIELSEN AYE SENATOR DRAWS OUT HI DURAZO HI SENATOR HERTZBERG. SENATOR ALL RIGHT WIENER I. THE VOTE IS FORTY ZERO THE BILL IS OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- HAVE ONE MORE BILL IF I COULD JUST HAVE A MINUTE. ALL. MADAM CHAIR HAS S. B. 13492% PROCEED AS YOU WILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR. GIVE ME GREAT PLEASURE TO PRESENT S. B. THIRTEEN FORTY NINE WHICH WOULD CREATE A NEW STATE TAX CREDIT TO INCENTIVIZE THE USE OF THE FEDERAL WORK OPPORTUNITY TAX CREDIT FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IS BEING PROVIDED AND I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENT PROPOSED IN COMMENT FIVE ON PAGE FOUR OF THE ANALYSIS. IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENACTED A NEW LAW ESTABLISHING THE WORK OPPORTUNITY TAX CREDIT WHICH ALLOWS EMPLOYERS TO CLAIM A FEDERAL TAX CREDIT IF THEY HIRE AN INVESTED INDIVIDUALS SEEKING TO WORK THAT HAVE CONSISTENTLY FACE BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT. THROUGH THIS FEDERAL TAX CREDIT EMPLOYERS CAN CLAIM A CREDIT BASED ON WAGES PAID TO INDIVIDUALS FROM CERTAIN TARGETED GROUPS. ELIGIBLE SEEKERS JOBSEEKERS INCLUDE VETERANS WITH THE SERVICE CONNECTED DISABILITY TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE TO NEEDY FAMILIES AND FOOD STAMP RECIPIENTS FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS ON LONG TERM UNEMPLOYMENT JUST TO NAME A FEW. THROUGH THIS PROGRAM EMPLOYERS OBTAINED CERTIFICATION TO THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT TO ENSURE INDIVIDUALS HIGHER MEET THE QUALIFICATIONS UNDER THE WORK OPPORTUNITY TAX CREDIT AND EMPLOYERS PROVIDE THIS FOR CERTIFICATION TO THE IRS WHEN CLAIMING THE CREDIT. IN TWENTY TWENTY CALIFORNIA PROVIDED CERTIFICATION FOR OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES FOR THE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THE ECONOMY IS STILL LEAVING TOO MANY PEOPLE BEHIND. DESPITE RECOVERING UNEMPLOYMENT RATES. MANY INDIVIDUALS FACE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT AND STRUGGLE TO FIND WORK AND REMAIN UNEMPLOYED. INDIVIDUALS IMPACTED BY THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SYSTEM SUCH AS THOSE THAT WERE FORMERLY INCARCERATED STILL HAVE VERY HIGH RATES OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND ACCORDING TO THE CENTER FOR LAW AND SOCIAL POLICY. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS IS OVER INCARCERATED BLACK MEN IT IS ABOVE 35% S. B. THIRTEEN FORTY NINE WILL FURTHER INCENTIVIZE THE USE OF THE WORK OPPORTUNITY TAX CREDIT BY CREATING A SIMPLE EXPANSION OF THE CURRENT FEDERAL PROGRAM. INSTEAD OF CREATING A I CALIFORNIA'S VERSION OF THE PROGRAM WHICH IS ADMINISTRATIVELY BURDENSOME AND COSTLY FOR THAT FRANCHISE TAX BOARD THIS BILL WILL SIMPLY ALLOW AN EMPLOYER TO HIRE A QUALIFIED CALIFORNIA JOB SEEKER. TO PROVIDE THE SAME CERTIFICATION UNDER THE FEDERAL PROBE PROGRAM FIFTY B. IN OTHER WORDS THEY COULD TAKE THAT FEDERAL CERTIFICATION FROM OUR OWN DEPARTMENT OF A OF EMPLOYMENT AND EMPLOYMENT. TO F. T. B. TO RECEIVE AN ADDITIONAL ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR TAX CREDIT AGAINST THEIR CALIFORNIA TAXES. THIS TAX CREDIT HAS A PROVEN TRACK RECORD OF HELPING TO EMPLOY PEOPLE WHO HAVE FACED A STARK BARRIERS TO CAREER STABILITY AND HELP LIFT INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY. WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB THIRTEEN FORTY NINE. AND TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS IS ADAM KAY WHO'S THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE REDWOOD CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND STEVE ABBOTT POLICY LEAD WITH GUSTO. THE RECOVERY- HAVE MISTER KANE WOULD YOU LIKE TO PROCEED. YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR THIS BILL AS WELL AS TO YOUR STAFF FOR ALL THEIR SUGGESTIONS AND TECHNICAL MAINTENANCE. I'M WITHOUT THE COMPILER WE JUST READ WHAT THE MAXIMUM AND WE HAVE. SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF COMPANIES OPERATING CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE A- A VERY COMPLETE CENTRIC CLEANING SERVICE COMPANIES ON THE TECHNOLOGY SIDE. ARE THE HOME CARE SIDE AND EVEN SOME CAR DEALERSHIPS AND CAR DEALERSHIPS ALL OF WHICH HAVE A BIG- SERVICE EMPLOYEE BASE I THINK THE SENATOR DESCRIBED THE CREDIT VERY WELL IT'S REALLY TARGETING PEOPLE WHO EMPLOYMENT. AND ESPECIALLY GROUPS. HAVE BEEN HARD HIT BY THE PANDEMIC. WE HOPE THAT IN EXTRA TAX CREDIT ON TOP OF THE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT WOULD HAVE. IMPACT OF THE INCREASING THE WORKFORCE PARTICIPATION RATE. WHICH IS DESPERATELY NEEDED AS WE STILL HAVE WORK FORCE PARTICIPATION LAGGED RATES FLAT EVEN- THE PREVENTIVA TIMES. WILL ALSO HELP BUSINESSES WITH TO AVOID THE SIGNIFICANT WAGE INFLATION WHICH IS A DESIRABLE OUTCOME OF THIS ECONOMY BUT IT COMES ON THE HEELS OF- A COUPLE OF VERY BAD YEARS YOUR BUSINESSES AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO SEE. WE JUST GO UP AND THIS WILL HELP WITH THAT. AND FINALLY AT THE MENTIONED. THIS IS REALLY A STATE AND FEDERAL PARTNERSHIP AT THIS AT AT CURRENTLY BECAUSE- THE STATE CERTIFY THE ELIGIBILITY AND HAS ALL THE DATA AND THEN WE TAKE THAT THAT INFORMATION WAS SENT TO THE IRS. IF YOU HAD A OR STATUS A CREDIT ON TOP OF THE FEDERAL CREDIT IT'S VERY EFFICIENT FOR THE STATE TO ADMINISTER. BUT JUST AS IMPORTANT IT'S VERY EFFICIENT EASY UNDERSTAND PER COMPLAINERS WHO ARE HIRING THE SOCIAL WANT TO HIDE SPOKE TO UNDERSTAND INSTEAD WE WOULD EXPECT. WIDER PARTICIPATION THAN OTHER EFFORTS LIKE THIS IN THE PAST WHERE THERE. WAS SORT OF MORE COMPLEX CREDITS. MISTER MANAGEMENT. IS NUMBER ONE STATE FOR WORK OPPORTUNITY TAX CREDIT IN THE COUNTRY AND IS NUMBER ONE SPECIFIC CATEGORIES INCLUDING. APPLICABLES RECIPIENTS OF CANADA AND THE LONG TERM UNEMPLOYED. IT'S FISCAL IMPACT OBVIOUSLY PROTECT TAX RATE HAS A YOU KNOW A REVENUE IMPACT BUT OBVIOUSLY WE'RE TAKING. PEOPLE OUT OF THE STATE PROGRAMS OFF OF UNEMPLOYMENT INTO THE WORKFORCE ONE WOULD EXPECT THAT TO GROW THE ECONOMY INCREASE REVENUES. FINALLY I WOULD NOTE THAT WIDE COALITION OF MANY MANY ORGANIZATIONS THAT SUPPORT THIS SIMPLE PROGRAM THAT TARGETS IMPORTANT GROUPS FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE PURPOSES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. WE HAVE ANOTHER WITNESS THE NEW STEVE ABBOTT. GARY YES YES. OKAY AT THANK YOU MEASURE ON THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY TODAY MY NAME IS STEVE ABIT NINE PUBLIC POLICY MEET ACOSTA A PEOPLE PLATFORM EMPOWERS SMALL TO MEDIUM SIZED BUSINESSES AND WE ARE PROUD TO LEND OUR SUPPORT FOR SB THIRTEEN FORTY NINE AND ALL THAT WOULD CREATE A WORK OPPORTUNITY TAX CREDIT FOR CALIFORNIA.

AND OFFENDER RUSSELL YEAH I'M KNOWING THE SENATORS HISTORY OF CARING OF FOR OUR SPECIAL AIRPORT COMMUNITIES ARE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES- I THINK I HAVE A AN IDEA OF WHY YOU'RE MOVING THIS MONTH TO GET PEOPLE WHO ARE EVEN WORSE SITUATION OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK SO I. TOTALLY SUPPORTER OF THAT- LAST YEAR WHEN I OFTEN WAS ABLE TO MOVE OF THE BILL TO HELP WELL LEGISLATION OR FUNDING TO HELP HOME PREVIOUSLY HOMELESS. INDIVIDUALS I LEARNED A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT IT- I THINK I WOULD I WOULD JUST URGE YOU TO. LOOK FOR WAYS IN WHICH THOSE INDIVIDUALS- THAT GET THE JOBS AND THE EMPLOYERS THAT HIRE THEM IS HOW TO HELP THOSE INDIVIDUALS GET EVEN FURTHER THAN JUST. THE JOB WHO KNOWS FOR SIX MONTHS A YEAR YOU KNOW HOWEVER LONG THE ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS MIGHT HELP THAT EMPLOYER- BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING FOR IS A REAL LONG TERM. COMMITMENT TO THESE INDIVIDUALS OTHERWISE THEY FALL INTO THE SAME THING A CYCLE OF THE SAME INDIVIDUALS GETTING HIRED FOR SIX MONTHS OR A YEAR HERE AND BLAH BLAH BLAH AND THAT DOESN'T REALLY GIVE THE- THE STABILITY THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR- SO I JUST. URGE TO SEE HOW WE COULD CONNECT THEM EITHER YOU KNOW- THAT THEY BE IN THE SYSTEM WHETHER SUPPORT SERVICES ALREADY- WHAT WE DID WITH THE HOMELESS WE HAD A- A 120% OF THE MINIMUM WAGE THAT WAS JUST SLIGHTLY MORE. TO GIVE THAT INCENTIVE TO A TO THE EMPLOYEES TO THE MEN AND WOMEN THEY HIRED SO THAT'S JUST ONE PIECE AND I'M I'M JUST CURIOUS- THE EX BELIEVE BUSINESSES ARE EXCLUDED WHAT'S THE SORT OF. RATIONALE FOR THE THAT I CAN GET THE- NOT. BUSINESSES THAT ARE SEXUALLY ORIENTED. BUT THE A FEW OF THE OTHER ONES I'M JUST CURIOUS. WHY THERE IT IS THAT ARE EX YEAH IT SAYS TEMP I GET TEMPORARY HELP- RETAIL TRADES. FOOD SERVICES DINNER THEATERS. BECAUSE HE KNOWS YEAH USUALLY IT'S RELATED TO TEST SEX AND ALCOHOL OR DRUGS. BUT OKAY OKAY THAT ANYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH THAT. RETAIL TRADES ANYWAY WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT SOME MORE BUT- I WAS CURIOUS I HAD NOT SEEN THAT BEFORE. OKAY THANK YOU YEAH MY I THINK PART OF THE PART OF THE REASON THAT IT SET UP THE WAY IT IS WE JUST WANTED TO TAKE EXACTLY WITH THE FEDS. WERE DOING- SO T'S NOT NECESSARILY OUR EVALUATION OF WHAT WHETHER THOSE ARE. GOOD BUSINESSES ARE NOT QUITE FRANKLY SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT MAKE THE MOST MONEY OR BARTENDERS PEOPLE THAT WORK IN THAT KIND OF A OF A TRADE BUT- BUT WE JUST TOOK THE FOR. THE FEDERAL- STRUCTURE AND SAID LET'S LET'S ADD. TO IT AND- MAKE IT WORK.
