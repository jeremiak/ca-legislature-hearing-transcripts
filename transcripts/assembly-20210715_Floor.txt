THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM SO PROUD TO PRESENT ON THIS FLOOR SB ONE FORTY FOUR JOIN AUTHORED BY MY SENATE COLLEAGUES ARE SENATE COLLEAGUE IN GLENDALE ASSEMBLY COLLEAGUE FROM ANY MARINA DEL REY AND MYSELF. SB ONE FORTY FOUR EXPANDS THE FILM AND TELEVISION TAX CREDIT PROGRAM WITH AN EMPHASIS ON INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT. AND WORKER WORKFORCE DIVERSITY IT EXPANDS THE EXISTING CREDIT BY NINETY MILLION FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS. IT INCLUDES A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION FOR NEW FILL INFRASTRUCTURE CREDITS. FOR THE SOUND STAGES THEREBY INCREASING PRODUCTION IT CREATES A TO EARN A HIGH PERCENT OF CREDIT SUPPORT NEEDS BELOW THE LINE AND ABOVE THE LINE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT GOALS THAT THEY THEMSELVES SET AND WHICH ARE. IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE AND FEDERAL LAW. I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE MOTION PICTURE ASSOCIATION AND THE ENTERTAINMENT UNION COALITION ON THESE EFFORTS AND I'M MOST GRATEFUL FOR THE BICAMERAL PARTNERSHIP THE MY SENATE COLLEAGUES FROM GLENDALE AND I HAVE FORMED. HE REPRESENTS A DISTRICT THAT IS HOME TO STUDIO AND TELEVISION COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN IN CALIFORNIA FOR DECADES. WELL I REPRESENT A DISTRICT THAT IS HOME TO MANY OF THE ABOVE THE LINE CREATIVES WRITERS PRODUCERS DIRECTORS AN ONSCREEN TALENT AND OF COURSE. TALENTED AND HARD WORKING BELOW THE LINE WORKERS FROM SOUND ENGINEERS GRIPS MAKE UP AND WARDROBE DESIGNERS AND SO ON. CALIFORNIA MUST BE COMPETITIVE TO ENSURE THESE JOBS DON'T LEAVE THE STATE.THE BY CAMEL PARTNERSHIP IN THROUGH THE WORK DONE AND BUDGETS OF FOR WITH REGARDS TO OVERSIGHT OF THE FILM TAX COMMISSION. SB ONE FORTY FOUR HAS ALLOWED US TO BE ABLE TO WORK ON INCREASING GOOD MIDDLE CLASS UNION JOBS IN THE FILM INDUSTRY. RETAINING AND BRING ABOUT PRODUCTION TO CALIFORNIA AND MOVING FORWARD ENSURING THAT THE FILM TAX COMMISSION HAS THE AUTHORITY TO BEGIN TO CREATE A REAL PLAN OF ACTION. IN WHICH DATA COLLECTION IS INTER WOVEN AND IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE LEGISLATION OF THE LEGISLATURE'S DECISION MAKING PROCESS AND ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIA TAX DOLLARS ARE REFLECTION. OF THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE. CALIFORNIA'S INVESTMENTS IN THE FILM TAX CREDIT OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS IS JUST ABOUT. EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. BUT THE RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT IN THE IMPACT TO OUR ECONOMY HAS BEEN AT THE TUNE OF SIX. BILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S A GREAT INVESTMENT. WHAT WE CAN DO BETTER. EARLIER THIS YEAR OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO WHO HAPPENS TO BE MY SEATMATE. CHAIR TO SELECT COMMITTEE HEARING ON UNSEEN MEDINA IN HOLLYWOOD. WHICH TRENDING HASHTAGS LIKE OSCARS SO WHITE WHAT WE HEARD ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES TO ENTER THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY WITH APPALLING. AND YET NOT NEW. IN TWENTY NINETEEN A USC STUDY PUBLISHED A REPORT EXAMINING TWELVE HUNDRED TOP GROSSING FILMS FROM TWO THOUSAND SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. AND THE REPRESENTATION OF LATINOS BOTH ON SCREEN AND BEHIND THE CAMERA. OF THE TOP ONE HUNDRED GROSSING DOMESTIC FEATURES IN THE PAST TWELVE YEARS LET ME KNOW CHARACTERS MAKE UP ONLY FOUR POINT 5% OF ALL SPEAKING ROLES. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ALONE AND JUST THE ONE HUNDRED TOP FILMS. FORTY SEVEN OF THE ONE HUNDRED WERE MISSING LET ME pMISSING AT THE MATH NINETY FIVE DID NOT FEATURE ANY LET ME KNOW CHARACTER WITH A DISABILITY. NINETY EIGHT WERE MISSING AT THE NOTES ON THE LGBT COMMUNITY AND ONLY 4% WERE DIRECTORS 3% OR PRODUCERS AND ONLY ONE LATINO DIRECTOR ACROSS THE ENTIRE TWELVE HUNDRED FILMS. COMPLETELY ERASED LATINO CHARACTERS. DATA DOES NOT LIE. THE SAME SENTIMENTS CAN BE SHARED ACROSS THE BOARD WITH API BLACK AND LGBT COMMUNITIES IN THE INTERSECTION ALITY OF VARIOUS GROUPS. MEMBERS CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO SIXTEEN MILLION LATINOS CLOSE 240% OF THE POPULATION. MAKING UP THE MAJORITY OF THE STATE. WHAT THE COUNTRY LATINOS ARE THE LARGEST AND FASTEST GROWING POPULATION AND PAY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN TAXES. INCLUDING A HUNDRED AND SIXTY BILLION IN FEDERAL INCOME TAXES AS WELL AS EIGHTY SIX BILLION IN STATE AND LOCAL TAXES. AND GUESS WHAT WE LOVE GOING TO THE MOVIES YET WE ARE NOT REFLECTED IN THE VERY FILMS. THAT WE WATCH. SB ONE FORTY FOUR IS A NEW MODEL. IT WILL EXPAND EXISTING TAX CREDITS IT WILL INVEST IN STUDIO INFRASTRUCTURE WILL CREATE A PATHWAY FOR EQUITY AND DIVERSITY FOR BOTH BELOW AND ABOVE THE LINE WORKFORCE IT WILL ENSURE DATA COLLECTION IT WILL KEEP AND BRING BACK PRODUCTION THE CALIFORNIA IT WILL CREATE THE NEXT GENERATION OF WORKERS FOR THIS INDUSTRY AND ULTIMATELY ENSURE THE CALIFORNIA REMAINS THE GLOBAL LEADER. IN THE ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTION SB ONE FORTY FOUR CREATES OPPORTUNITIES OF WHICH EQUITY IS AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE CONVERSATION OF COOL WHEN WHERE AND HOW. STORIES ARE TOLD. SO WHEN YOU AREN'T RELAXING AT HOME. STREAMING ON YOUR SHOW. OR YOU GO TO THE MOVIE THEATER AND YOU SIT BACK AND ENJOY THE FULL CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE. JEFF NO. THAT CALIFORNIA HAS MADE EVERY EFFORT TO SHIP AN INDUSTRY TO BE MORE REFLECTIVE OF ITS AUDIENCE AND TO ME MEMBERS THAT IS PROGRESS. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE MATTER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS AND APPEALING PART OF CRAFTING TAX POLICY IS WHEN WE CAN INVEST IN AND SUPPORT A HOMEGROWN INDUSTRY ONE THAT WE CONSIDER OUR OWN ONE THAT GREW UP IN OUR STATE. AND ONE THAT WE ARE PROUD OF AND ONE THAT GENERATES GOOD PAYING JOBS AND THAT WILL HELP MAINTAIN CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS. WELL THAT DESCRIPTION CERTAINLY CAN BE APPLIED TO THE FILM AND TV INDUSTRY. AND I WAS PROUD TO CO AUTHOR A COUPLE OF THE PREVIOUS ITERATIONS OF THIS CREDIT THAT WE'RE CONSIDERING TODAY. THAT DESCRIPTION THAT I JUST LISTED FOR YOU. MOST CERTAINLY CAN ALSO BE APPLIED TO THE BIOTECHNOLOGY AND LIFE SCIENCES INDUSTRY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I GREW UP IN AND STILL LIVE IN SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO WHICH IS THE ACTUAL BIRTHPLACE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY. MY DISTRICT IS NOW HOME TO WELL OVER TWO HUNDRED. OF THESE BIOTECH AND LIFE SCIENCES COMPANIES THAT UTILIZE UNION LABOR WHEN EXPANDING THEIR CAMPUSES IT IS NOW VERY MUCH THE GENERAL EMPLOYER ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THESE ARE CAMPUSES WERE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IS BEING DONE TO FIND LIFESAVING CURES AND TREATMENTS AND THERAPIES. YOU RECALL THAT WHEN KOBE HIT. ANY ECONOMY CAME TO A HALT AND HEFTY DEFICITS WERE PROJECTED ACTION WAS TAKEN TO SUSPEND THESE LIFE SCIENCES COMPANIES ABILITY TO UTILIZE THE RD TAX CREDIT AND NET OPERATING LOSS OPTIONS. SAYS WE KNOW THE BUDGET IS NOW IN SURPLUS AND THIS ACTION WE'RE TAKING TODAY IS TO EXPAND. THE FILM AND PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT. BUT SO FAR THIS BUILDING HAS NOT YET NEARLY RESTORED THE PRE EXISTING LIFE SCIENCES R&amp;D AT A WHILE CREDIT. WELL I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL THAT BENEFITS THE CALIFORNIA COMPANIES THAT MADE ENTERTAINMENT. AND CREATIVE DISTRACTION POSSIBLE DURING THIS PANDEMIC. MY HOPE IS THAT WE CAN ALSO FIND THE LOGIC IN RESTORING THE PRE PANDEMIC TAX CREDITS TO THE LIFE SCIENCES INDUSTRY WHICH IS ACTUALLY WORKING ON VACCINES. AND THERAPIES FOR COVERT. AND A RANGE OF DISEASES. IF BUDGETS AND IN THIS CASE TAX POLICY OR STATEMENT OF OUR VALUES. SURELY THERE IS ROOM FOR BOTH POLICIES AND PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY. THERE SHOULD BE ROOM FOR A COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION OF THE EFFICACY OF NOT ONLY THESE CREDITS BUT ALL OF OUR TAX CREDITS. THE GEOGRAPHIC BALANCE IN TAX POLICY AND WHICH INDUSTRIES TRULY WILL BE THE DRIVERS OF SUSTAINED ECONOMIC RECOVERY. IN CALIFORNIA. AND SHOULD I SAY FUTURE BUDGET. SURPLUSES AT LEAST WE HOPE. SO I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE BUT I ALSO ASK FOR A MORE COMPREHENSIVE CONVERSATION ABOUT COHERENCE IN OUR TAX POLICY GOING FORWARD. TO KEEP ALL OF CALIFORNIA ECONOMICALLY COMPETITIVE WITH THE MANY STATES THAT COVET. THESE JOBS THANK YOU ASK FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU MR MILLER AND MR GABRIEL YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE MATTER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND- I JUST WANT TO RISE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE WANT TO COMPLEMENT. OUR COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES AND OUR COLLEAGUE FROM MARINA DEL REY FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP ON THIS I THINK ARE CALLING FROM LOS ANGELES. LAID OUT THE CASE VERY THOROUGHLY I JUST WANT TO ADD ONE POINT TO THIS I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF CONVERSATION ABOUT THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. AND I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THERE IS NOT THIS IS NOT ABOUT CELEBRITIES THIS IS ABOUT PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR DRY CLEANERS PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR CATERS. SOUND ENGINEERS THE INCREDIBLE FOLKS AND I GOT SEE WHO ARE THE HEART AND SOUL OF OUR CREATIVE ECONOMY AND OUR DISTRICT IN ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY HERE. IN LOS ANGELES THIS IS A BILL THAT WILL HAVE BROAD BENEFITS FOR WORKING FAMILIES. VERY PRIVILEGE TO CHAIR A SELECT COMMITTEE TO HAVE A HEARING ON THIS ISSUE ON THE TAX CREDITS LAST YEAR. WAS ATTENDED BY ALL OF THE MEMBERS FROM THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY AND WE HEARD EXTRAORDINARY TESTIMONY ABOUT NOT ONLY THE MILLIONS OF DIRECT JOBS THAT THIS TAX CREDIT CRATES. BUT THE MILLIONS OF INDIRECT JOBS THE MULTIPLIER EFFECT THROUGHOUT THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS EXTRAORDINARY. WE KNOW THAT THE CREATIVE ECONOMY. IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY ARE PART OF THE DNA OF CALIFORNIA THEY ARE PART OF WHAT MAKES THE GOLDEN STATE SPECIAL THIS IS SOMETHING WITH PROVEN BENEFITS AND I WOULD STRONGLY URGE AN AYE VOTE ON THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. THANK YOU MR GABRIEL MISS PETRI NORRIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED HIM AS IRWIN STATUS. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I CHIU RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE FORTY FOUR TODAY I KNOW YESTERDAY IN OUR REVENUE TAX HEARING THE AUTHOR SENATOR PORTANTINO. I MADE A VERY COMPELLING CASE FOR WHY THESE TAX CREDITS ARE SO IMPORTANT FOR STIMULATING ECONOMIC GROWTH ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR CREATING GOOD JOBS AT BOTH ABOVE AND BELOW THE LINE SO HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY BUT I WILL NOTE. I'M SIMILAR TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE BAY AREA I THINK WHEN WE TAKE A STEP BACK AND CONSIDER THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF A BROADER TAX POLICY. I AM LEFT SCRATCHING MY HEAD A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE WE THINK ABOUT TAX CREDITS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT UNFINISHED BUSINESS FROM OUR LAST BUDGET YEAR AS YOU MAY RECALL. I EARLY TWELVE MONTHS AGO WE THOUGHT WE WERE FACING A THIRTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET DEFICIT. WHICH SOME TOUGH CHOICES INCLUDING. IMPLEMENTING A CAP ON TAX CREDITS ALL ACROSS THE STATE INCLUDING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDIT ACTUALLY INCLUDING THE FILM TAX CREDIT INCLUDING THE CAL COMPETES TAX CREDIT I. SO I WOULD URGE US IN ADDITION TO MOVING FORWARD AND I VOTING FOR THISBILL TODAY TO CONSIDER REINSTATING THE TAX CREDITS THAT EXISTED PRE PANDEMIC. AND RESTORING THOSE TAX CREDITS IN FULL THOSE ARE OCCURRING RIGHT NOW IS LIABILITIES ON OUR BALANCE SHEET I THINK WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THAT. WE LIFT THOSE CAPS NOW AND ENSURE THAT WE ARE STIMULATING ECONOMIC GROWTH CREATING GOOD JOBS IN THE FILM INDUSTRY IN THE LIFE SCIENCES SECTOR INTACT IN AEROSPACE. INDUSTRIES AND REGIONS ALL ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU RESPECTFULLY AT RICHER I THOUGHT. THANK YOU MESSAGE IN OUR SISTER GIVE SEND YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE MATTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS TODAY I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL. OF ONE FORTY FOUR AND THANK MY SISTER FROM THE LOS ANGELES FOR STANDING UP AND BRING IN THIS OF COURSE. BEFORE US TODAY TO EXPAND THE TAX CREDIT FOR THE FILM INDUSTRY BUT ALSO SEEK TO ENCOURAGE DIVERSITY. THIS IS IN PART SPEAKS TO. THE HEART OF THE EFFORT I CHAMPION THIS YEAR- BUT UNFORTUNATELY- THE BIT MY BILL WAS HELD- IN COMMITTEE A. B. NINE EIGHTY SIX THE- DIVERSITY FILM TAX CREDIT. WHICH WOULD HAVE CREATED A TAX CREDIT SPECIFICALLY. TO THE INDEPENDENT FILM INDUSTRY TO PROMOTE DIVERSITY. MEMBERS IT IS CRITICAL CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE FILM STAR FILM TAX CREDIT REFLECTS THE TRUE DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. HAVING DIVERSITY IN THE FILM INDUSTRY TO MATCH WHAT CALIFORNIA LOOKS LIKE CREATES A SPACE FOR INCLUSION UNDERSTANDING. AND ALSO IT PROMOTES DIVERSITY AT THE SAME TIME. MEMBERS WE ARE STRONG WE ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT- SENATE BILL ONE FORTY FOUR- WE HOPE THAT WE CAN- CONTINUE TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION ESPECIALLY COME DOWN DIVERSITY IN THIS INDUSTRY. I WANT TO LIVE MY COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SAND. SAN FERNANDO VALLEY WE TALKED ABOUT IS MORE THAN JUST. ENTERTAINERS IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE THAT REFLECTS CALIFORNIA IS NOT ONLY IN FRONT OF THE FIELD BEHIND THE FIELD- FROM CATERING TO CLEANING TO ALL THE THINGS THAT MAKES UP THE FILM INDUSTRY. CALIFORNIA CAN HAVE THAT REFLECTION- CERTAINLY- YOU KNOW TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE SEEN- IN THIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRY SO I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL AND STRONGLY ASPEN I VOTE ON SENATE BILL ONE FORTY FOUR. THANK YOU MISTER GIBSON SEEING AND HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE ON THE MATTER MISS BURKE YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I RISE TODAY NOT ONLY IN MY CAPACITY AS CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE ON REVENUE AND TAXATION BUT ALSO AS A BLACK WOMAN. AS A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR AND AS SOMEONE WHOSE FAMILY HAS BEEN DEEPLY AFFECTED BY RUN AWAY FILM PRODUCTION. CALIFORNIANS FILM TAX CREDIT IS A PROVEN TRACK RECORD AND HAS GENERATED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY MORE THAN SEVEN TIMES. THE INVESTMENT CALIFORNIA HAS MADE IN THE SIGNATURE INDUSTRY. I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR ITS COMMITMENT TO IMPROVING THIS VITAL CREDIT AND MAKING IT MORE ROBUST. SB ONE FORTY FOUR ENSURES THAT EXISTING TELEVISION SERIES CONTINUE TO BE FILMED IN THE STATE. AND THE BILL'S NEW INFRASTRUCTURE CREDIT WILL ENCOURAGE THE CONSTRUCTION OF PERMANENT STUDIOS TO SECURE CALIFORNIA'S FILMING FUTURE. THE INFRASTRUCTURE WHAT CREDIT WILL ALSO DIRECTLY LEAD TO HIGH PAYING JOBS BOTH DURING RENOVATION AND CONSTRUCTION AND FOR YEARS TO COME. I ALSO WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES FOR HER WORK ON THE MEANINGFUL DIVERSITY MEASURE INCLUDED. IN THIS BILL. NEW JERSEY AND ILLINOIS TO HAVE SOME OF THE STRICTER AND MOST SUCCESS DIVERSITY MEASURE IN THE BILL INDUSTRY AND IT IS WHY. PAST TIME CALIFORNIA CATCH UP. A RECENT REPORT FROM THE NATIONAL RESEARCH GROUP SHOWED THAT TO. IN THREE AFRICAN. SAY THEY DON'T SEE THEM SO OR THE CULTURE. IN MOVIES OR TELEVISION. WITH 86% OF AFRICAN AMERICANS WANTING TO SEE MORE OF THESE REPUTATIONS AND TOLD STORIES ON THE SCREEN. THE VIEWS ARE BACKED BY DATA ACCORDING TO INFORMATION REPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA FILM COMMISSION BLACK CALIFORNIANS ARE UNDER REPRESENTED IN THE FILM INDUSTRY. MAKING UP ONLY FIVE POINT 6% OF HIRES. WHILE PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE. IT'S CLEAR THAT THE ENTIRE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY ECOSYSTEM STILL NEEDS TO IMPROVE ITS DIVERSITY. BUT THESE ARE NOT THE ONLY REASONS I SUPPORT THIS BILL. IT WAS JUST A WEEK AGO MY DAUGHTER'S FATHER STOOD IN MY HOUSE HOLDING BACK TEARS. HE WAS BROKEN HARD. DUE TO OUT OF STATE PRODUCTION IN HIS INDUSTRY HE HAS BEEN HOME LESS THAN TWENTY OF THE LAST A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS. MISSING HIS DAUGHTER'S SEVENTH BIRTHDAY A FEW WEEKS AGO. THESE ARE MOMENTS A PARENT CANNOT GET BACK. WHEN I HEAR PEOPLE SAY THIS BILLS LIKE THIS ARE JUST ABOUT PLEASING A PARTICULAR INDUSTRY I SAY YOU'RE WRONG. SB ONE FORTY FOUR IS ABOUT THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT IS INDUSTRY EMPLOYS. IT'S ABOUT THEIR FAMILIES. AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT THIS BILL MEANS TO ME. THE FILM TAX CREDIT IS SOMETHING WE CAN DO TO KEEP CALIFORNIANS EMPLOYED. AND FAMILIES TOGETHER. SO TODAY FOR MY DAUGHTER I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB ONE FORTY FOUR. BURKE WILL OPEN THE ROLE. MEMBERS VOTED OBSERVER. HOME MEMBERS VOTED TO THEIR TO THE. ALL MEMBERS THIRTY THIRD OF THE. CLERK WILL LOSE THE ROLLING TALLY THE I. SIXTY TWO KNOWS HERE THE MEASURE PASSES. MEMBERS WE HAVE A NUMBER OF BUDGET BILLS TO TAKE UP. THESE ARE RECIPES. WITHOUT REFERENCE THE FILE MR TANG WE'RE LOOKING TO TAKE UP SB. ONE SIXTY. THIS IS SB ONE SIXTY. THE CORPORATE SENATE BILL ONE SIXTY BY THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON BUDGET AND FISCAL REVIEW AN ACT RELATING TO CANNABIS AND MAKING AN APPROPRIATION THEREFORE TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY BE RELATED TO THE BUDGET MISTER CHENEY MAIL BUT THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER SB ONE SIXTY IS ON ANOTHER CANNABIS TRAILER BILL WHICH CONTAINS FIXES TO A NUMBER OF ITEMS IN FROM SB ONE FORTY ONE WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO RESOLVE ISSUES SO IN ADDITION TO THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS APPROPRIATE THE BUDGET. THIS BILL WILL ADDRESS OVER 80% OF THE CANNABIS LICENSEE STILL HOLDING PROVISIONAL LICENSES AND BRING THE INDUSTRY INTO ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE. WE STRUCK A BALANCE FOR THE NEED BETWEEN. LICENSES INTO COMPLIANCE WITH SEQUEL WHILE PROVIDING RESOURCES TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO SUPPORT THIS EFFORT. SB ONE SIXTY ALSO EXTEND THE AUTHORITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS CONTROL TO OFFER PROVISIONAL LICENSES. FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM FARMERS THE BILL EXTENDS THE ISSUANCE OF PROVISIONAL LICENSES TO JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY TWO. IT FOR LOCAL WE OPERATE OPERATORS THIS BILL EXTENDS THE DEADLINE TO JULY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. IN ADDITION SB ONE SIXTY DELAYS THE DEADLINE BY WHICH THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE MUST CREATE A PROCESS FOR LICENSED CULTIVATORS TO ESTABLISH APPELLATIONS. OF ORIGIN TO JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU MR CHANG MR FONG YOU ARE RECOGNIZED I THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. A MEMBERS TWO WEEKS AGO WE SENT EIGHTY ONE FORTY ONE TO THE GOVERNOR TO CONSOLIDATE THE STATE'S CANNABIS REGULATORY SCHEME. BUT LIKE THAT BILL SB ONE SIXTY A NOR IS THE INPUT OF KEY STAKEHOLDERS IT SEEKS TO TIMELINE MANDATES TO UNEQUAL TREATMENT IN THE INDUSTRY IT SEEMS THE STATE CANNOT GET THIS QUITE RIGHT. NOT ONLY WILL THIS BILL POSE SIGNIFICANT STRESSES ON INDUSTRY BUT IT COMPLICATES THE LICENSING PROCESS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND PUT THE MUCH NEEDED LOCAL REVENUE AT RISK. I REGION OF UP. MR LACKEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. YEAH THANK YOU SPEAKER MEMBER JUST REAL QUICKLY UNFORTUNATELY I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS PARTICULAR BILL BECAUSE IT'S JUST ANOTHER OBSTACLE FOR THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO COMPLY WITH THE PROVISIONAL LICENSING PROGRAM RIGHT NOW THE ILLICIT MARKET HAS SUCH AN OVERWHELMING DOMINANCE IN THIS MARKET. SHAME ON US IF WE MAKE IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO COMPETE AND COMPLY SHALL BE A STRONG NO. MISTER JONES SAWYER. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE TO TODAY TO SUPPORT SB ONE SIXTY. LET ME BE CLEAR TO COMBAT ILLICIT CANNABIS ACTIVITIES AND SHUT DOWN THE BLACK MARKET IN CALIFORNIA WE MUST REDUCE THE BARRIERS IN LEGAL CANNABIS BUSINESSES SPACE TO OBTAIN THESE LICENSES PROVISIONAL LICENSES ARE VITAL PIECE IN THE LONG TERM OPERATION OF THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY REPRESENTING THE VAST MAJORITY OF ALL CURRENT CANNABIS LICENSES. SB ONE SIX SIXTY MAKES NECESSARY CLEANUP CHANGES TO HELP LEGITIMATE CANNABIS BUSINESSES OBTAIN PROVISIONAL LICENSES AS THEY AWAIT APPROVAL FOR THEIR ANNUAL LICENSE HOWEVER I WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE ONE HUNDRED MILLION WE ALLOCATED EARLY THIS YEAR TWENTY TWO MILLION OF WHICH WENT TO L. A. COUNTY TO ASSESS THE MOST IMPACTED LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO PROVIDE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS. FOR PROVISIONAL LICENSE HOLDERS IS WHAT MAKES THESE CHANGES EFFECTIVE ON TOP OF THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ESPECIALLY HIGHLIGHT THAT THIS BILL FURTHER EXTENDS THE TIME LINE FOR SOCIAL EQUITY LICENSE APPLICANTS. AS WE CONTINUE TO ADDRESSED AND EQUAL ENFORCEMENT AGAINST PEOPLE OF COLOR AND THE STIGMA ASSOCIATED CAMPUS SOCIAL EQUITY PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE ONE FEATURED IN SB ONE SIXTY HELP ENSURE THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY SUFFERED THE EFFECTS OF THE WAR ON DRUGS CAN BENT CAN ALSO BENEFIT FROM THIS. ILLEGAL INDUSTRY. AS ONE OF THE FOUNDING FATHERS OF CANNABIS MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU RESTAURANTS WHERE.

THIS BILL PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK THAT SETS A PATH TO CONNECTING OUR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES BUT WE NEED TO ENGAGE ALL STAKEHOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT UNSERVED HOUSEHOLDS HAVE NEEDED BROADBAND ACCESS IN A TIME WHEN CAN ACTIVITY IS SO IMPORTANT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S ACCOUNTABILITY AND METRICS SO ARE RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES ARE NOT LEFT BEHIND. I URGE AND I'VE UP. THANK YOU MR FONG MISTER MURATSUCHI YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH COLLEAGUES I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB ONE FIFTY SIX THIS IS A HISTORIC INVESTMENT PARTICULARLY AND BROADBAND AND PUBLIC BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE.

IF YOU DON'T HAVE AFFORDABLE RELIABLE INTERNET ACCESS YOU CAN'T GET INTO THE CLASSROOM IF YOU DON'T HAVE RELIABLE INTERNET SERVICE YOU CAN'T TELECOMMUTE AND GET INTO THE WORKPLACE. FOR THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE INTERNET SERVICE THEY CAN'T SEE THEIR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS THIS HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR EDUCATION FOR EMPLOYMENT FOR PUBLIC SAFETY FOR A FOR HELP SO MANY AND RESPECTS. THIS IS A HISTORIC INVESTMENT AND PUBLIC BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE MIDDLE MILE THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FREEWAYS AND THE ROADS OF. INTERNET ACCESS AND SO THIS IS A GAME CHANGER WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ASPIRATIONS OF THIS THIS HISTORIC INVESTMENT IS ACTUALLY TRANSLATED INTO CLOSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE TO ADDRESS THE CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY.

LOCK LACK OF BROADBAND ACCESS COMPOUNDS EVERY CHALLENGE WE FACE IS A REGION WHETHER IT'S CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES DISTANT LEARNING OR PANDEMIC INDUCED BUSINESS CLOSURES NO INTERNET AND CELL SERVICE HAS MADE RESPONDING TO THESE ISSUES. THAT MUCH HARDER. IT'S PAST TIME OUR RURAL AREAS WERE PRIORITISED FOR BROADBAND AND I'M THANKFUL FOR THE BIPARTISAN PARTNERSHIP TO WORK TOWARDS A SCHOOL. I WANT TO THANK THE SPEAKER FOR INCLUDING ME IN THIS DISCUSSION MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR DEDICATION TO GETTING THIS DONE RIGHT.

AS MANY PEOPLE POINT OUT SPEECHES I JUST LIKE TO MAKE A POINT BECAUSE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE COSTS ARE SIGNIFICANT THIS CAN'T BE A ONE TIME THING. THERE HAS TO BE COMMITMENT ONGOING.

MISTER SPEAKER ONE IN A CALIFORNIA HOME STILL DO NOT HAVE INTERNET ACCESS AND SMALL TOWNS RULE COULD RURAL AREAS IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IS EVEN HIGHER NUMBER OF STUDENTS AND FAMILIES WHO REMAIN DISCONNECTED UNDER CURRENT STANDARDS. THE STATE'S ESTIMATE TO FILL THE GAP IS CUT CUT IN CONNECTIVITY IS SIX POINT NINE BILLION UNDER CURRENT TECHNOLOGY STANDARDS. AND THE FCC IS CONSIDERING RAISING THEM AS WE SPEAK. THERE ARE IN FACT PRODUCTIVITY PROBLEMS AND URBAN AND RURAL AREAS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THE TECHNOLOGY STATE. THE COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS MADE IT GLARINGLY CLEAR THAT WHILE CONNECTIVITY IS CRITICAL IN NORMAL TIMES IT CAN MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH IN TIMES OF EMERGENCY. OVER THE PAST SIXTEEN MONTHS TOO MANY OF OUR PEOPLE WENT WITHOUT CONNECTIONS TO TELEHEALTH. DISTANCE LEARNING AND THE DIGITAL ECONOMY THE MAKES MAKE OTHERS LIVES MOURNERS NORMAL. IN THE END DURING THE STATE'S INCREASINGLY DEVASTATING WILDFIRES AND OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS AND ACTIVITY CAN MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH. MEMBERS I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR OVER A DECADE STARTING AS MAYOR OF THE SMALL TOWN OF WINTERS TO FIX. TO FIX FOR COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE ELECT A VITAL INFRASTRUCTURE. TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND AND THEY TEND TO BE THOSE MOST IN NEED. A GREAT MANY OF US HERE ON THIS FLOOR ARE WORKING ON DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THIS FIGHT.

SB ONE FIFTY SIX. THANK YOU MEASURE VIA MISTER GIBSON. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE FIFTY SIX DEALER BROADBAND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR YOUR CONVERSATIONS I WANT TO THANK THE SPEAKER OUR OUR SPEAKER- ALSO HIS ENTIRE STAFF OF MY BILLS ON THE CALLS ARE WORKING WITH AND SO MANY OTHERS MY COLLEAGUES IN TERMS OF TRYING TO. PROVIDE INPUT IN TERMS OF HOW TO GET THIS BROADBAND BILL- TRAILER BILL RIGHT MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW THAT I AUTHORED ASSEMBLY BILL TWO FOURTEEN TWENTY FIVE DEALING WITH- CONNECTIVITY DELIVERED PUBLIC SUBSIDIZED HOUSING. THE THIS TRAILER BILL IS NOT A PERFECT BILL IT WOULD BE PERFECT IF WE INCLUDE ABA NOT FORGET THOSE WHO LIVE IN PUBLIC SUBSIDIZED HOUSING. THIS WEEKEND OR LAST WEEKEND I HAD OPPORTUNITY TO WALK OF FOR- PUBLIC SUBSIDIZED HOUSING IN MY DISTRICT- SOME OF THOSE OF NICKERSON GARDENS. JORDAN DOWNS IMPERIAL COURTS AND GUNS ACT BILLETS. THOSE PARTICULAR OF HOUSES WAS BUILT IN A TIME WHERE THEY HAVE CENTER BLOCK WALLS WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WELL I'M GLAD YOU ASKED YOU CAN'T PENETRATE YOU CAN'T EVEN PUT A PICTURE ON THE WALL WITH A NAIL BECAUSE THE WALLS ARE MADE OUT OF CONCRETE. SO TO HAVE ANY KIND OF SIGNALS COME IN THERE'S IMPOSSIBLE AND SO THERE WAS KIDS WHO WE TALK ABOUT DISTANCE LEARNING BUT THERE WAS NO DISTANCE LEARNING THAN A PROJECTS I'M SORRY WILL CALL THE PROJECTS ANYMORE THEY CALL HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS LET ME BE POLITICALLY CORRECT. KIDS WE'RE NOT DOING ANY DISTANCE LEARNING BECAUSE THEY HAD NO ABILITY TO DO IT. BECAUSE THEY HAD NO INTERNET THERE WAS NO THERE WAS NO CONNECTIVE ITTY TO THE INTERNET. ACCESS WHATSOEVER IN THOSE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS IN WHICH I REPRESENT. AND THAT'S THE SAME FOR THOSE EAST LOS ANGELES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA 40% OF CALIFORNIANS DUNCAN IS NOT CONNECTED. SO WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT TO CALIFORNIANS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A CALIFORNIA THAT IS CONNECTED. TO THE PRIVILEGE AND ONE THAT IS NOT CONNECTED AND DISENFRANCHISED. AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT WE CAN NOT FORGET ABOUT THE LEAST OF THESE. I BELIEVE THAT THESE ARE REPRESENT THE SIX FORCE DISAGREES THAT A CALIFORNIA. AND I WOULD SIMPLY SAY THAT MARKED. A CONSTITUENCIES ARE PART OF THE LEAST OF THESE THE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY. SO WE LABOR OVER THE WEEKEND TO TRY TO HAMMER OUT THE LANGUAGE I THINK WE FELL A LITTLE SHORT. WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO YES WE TALK ABOUT LOW INCOME RESIDENTS. BUT LOW INCOME RESIDENTS BUT THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN PUBLIC SUBSIDIZED HOUSING. I NEED TO MAKE SURE I CANNOT STAY ON THIS FLOOR AND REPRESENTS MY COMMUNITY ABOUT ALL RAISE THEIR VOICES. THERE WERE KIDS WILL FOLLOW ME. ON LAST WEEKEND SATURDAY WHERE THEY WOULD NORMALLY BE PLAYING WITH OTHER KIDS THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THEY WERE WITH ME PASSED OUT LITERATURE ABOUT FOURTEEN TWENTY FIVE BECAUSE THEY WANT TO HAVE. CONNECTIVITY'S YOU TO BROADBAND SERVICE AND WE DO OUR COMMUNITY THAT ON JUST IF IN FACT WE DON'T MAKE SURE THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT LEFT OUT THEY HAVE TO BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION WE'RE NOT DOING ITS JOB I'M NOT DOING MY JOB IF I DON'T RAISE MY VOICE TO MY MICROPHONE. TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THOSE PEOPLE THE PEOPLE THAT I STILL DON'T SHOW TO GAVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE AND SO I REYES THAT BOYS AND REYES A CONSCIOUS LEVEL WITH EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU OUR WORK IS STILL. IS NOT DONE YET WE STILL HAVE TO HAMMER OUT THE WORK AND I WOULD THINK MY COLLEAGUE FROM COACHELLA FOCUS ON BEING A DRUM MAJOR FOR JUSTICE I'M TO MAKING SURE THAT EVEN THOUGH WE PASSAGE TRAILER BILL TODAY. THAT THERE'S STILL WORK TO BE DONE IN THIS SPACE I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE THE RIGHT THING TO DO BECAUSE IT SUPPORTS THE RULE COMMUNITIES. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR PEOPLE TO DRIVE TEN MILES FROM WHERE THEY LIVE IN A RURAL COMMUNITY TO TRY TO FIND SOME CONNECTIVITY THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME WE LIVE IN THE FITNESS WORLD ACCOUNT ACADEMY. AND WE HAVE TO GET A RIGHT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE POLICIES THAT WE PUT FORTH ON THIS FLOOR INCLUDES THE LEAST. OF THESE I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THEY MUST GIVE. MISS WALDRON. YOUR RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS CLEARLY UNDERSERVED AS FAR AS BROADBAND GOES MY DISTRICT. IS 85% WORLD THERE IS NO INFRASTRUCTURE THERE THERE MIGHT BE A TOWER UP ON PALOMAR MOUNTAIN. AND WHEN THERE'S ICE THERE'S NO SERVICE WHEN THERE'S- LEAVES THE GIRL IN FRONT THERE'S NO SERVICE YOU CAN BARELY GET FIVE M. PBS OF ANY DOWNLOAD ANYWAY SO MOST OF MY DISTRICT HAS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM. IN GETTING ACCESS TO BROADBAND SO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS DEFINITELY AFFECTED AND SHOULD NOT BE LEFT OUT. BUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO LOOK FORWARD AS THIS BILL MOVES IS THAT THIS IS NOT. COMPLETE I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE WORK DONE ESPECIALLY IN MAKING SURE THAT WE DIRECTLY REQUIRE THAT THE THREE POINT TWO FIVE BILLION. THAT IS BEING DEPLOYED IN UNSERVED AREAS DEFINED AS TWENTY FIVE M. B. PS DOWN STREAMING TO ENSURE THE PUBLIC FUNDS. ARE NOT USED TO OVER BUILD WITH THERE'S EXISTING FACILITIES. THERE NEEDS TO BE A CLEAR DEFINITION OF RURAL AND URBAN TO ENSURE FAIRNESS. AND TO STREAMLINE PERMITS AN ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW TO GET THIS DONE SO. THERE'S STILL SOME WORK TO BE DONE BUT I DEFINITELY SUPPORT THIS AND WE NEED TO GET MOVING ON IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS WALDRON MR RAHMAN'S. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED AT YOUR DESK THANK YOU AND THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER IN IT THANK YOU FOR ALL MY COLLEAGUES FOR BRINGING- THE MUCH NEEDED BROADBAND ACCESS TO ALL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND TO MY COLLEAGUE THAT MENTIONED THAT DURING COAL THAT EXPOSE A LOT OF THINGS HOWEVER IN THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS IT'S- AN ISSUE THAT'S BEEN PLAGUING US FOR MANY MANY YEARS- BEING LEFT OUT OF THE PROCESS. SO I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES WERE INCLUDING IN THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION THE INCLUSION OF TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS IN THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE. BROADBAND ACCESS IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE IS AVAILABLE TO ALL CALIFORNIA PEOPLE INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES I WANT TO THANK THEM MY COLLEAGUES IN THIS BODY FOR BEING ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD TO INCLUDE THE TRIBAL GOVERNMENT. IN PART OF THAT PROCESS AND MAKING SURE THEY'LL HAVE A VOICE WITH THE OPEN ACCESS TO MIDDLE MILE BROADBAND NETWORK LOCATIONS MAKING SURE THAT THOSE COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT BROADBAND FOR ALL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LET'S REMEMBER THE TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN OVERLOOKED FOR MANY YEARS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT THROUGH THIS LEGISLATION THROUGH THIS BODY HERE TODAY WITH THE DIVERSITY THAT WE HAVE FOR THE FIRST TIME WE'RE INCLUDING THEM IN IMPORTANT BILLS LIKE THIS. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THAT BROADBAND ACCESS SO EDUCATION TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD IN TIMES OF EMERGENCY THERE'S ACCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE RESPONDING IN TIMES OF NEED. I WANT TO THANK THIS BODY I WANT FONG THANK THE AUTHORS AND DOES IT WORKED ON IT FOR INCLUDING THE TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU AND I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. THEY RESTAURANTS MR LEVINE. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE FIFTY SIX THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. IS A THREE YEAR SIX BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN BROADBAND. AND IT'S THE LARGEST PUBLIC INVESTMENT TO ELIMINATE CALIFORNIA'S DIGITAL DIVIDE. IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. THE PANDEMIC HAS SHOWN US THAT JUST AS CLEAN WATER SAFE STREETS BRIDGES AND ROADS. AND RELIABLE ELECTRICITY IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. ACCESS TO RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE HIGH SPEED INTERNET IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE FUTURE. SUCCESS OF CALIFORNIA FOR GENERATIONS TO COME. I SHARE CONCERNS ABOUT HOW WE MEASURE THE SUCCESS OF THIS AMBITIOUS ENDEAVOR. WILL WE GET THIS RIGHT. IN MEASURING SUCCESS HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THERE IS APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THOSE WE WILL AND TRUST TO BUILD CALIFORNIA'S MIDDLE MILE TO EVERY COMMUNITY ACROSS CALIFORNIA HOW DO WE MEASURE SUCCESS TO ENSURE THAT URBAN SUBURBAN AND RURAL COMMUNITIES. ARE TREATED EQUITABLY HOW DO YOU MEASURE SUCCESS AND HOW DO WE MEASURE CLOSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. HOW DO WE MEASURE IF THERE'S A BIG INVESTMENT IN BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE ACHIEVED ITS NOBLE GOALS. OR FELL VICTIM TO HIGH EXPECTATIONS BUT AN EVEN OR UNCLEAR OUTCOMES. THIS INVESTMENT IS A METAPHOR FOR THIS YEAR'S BUDGET PROCESS. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THIS YEAR'S BUDGET RIGHT. AND IT'S OKAY TO TAKE THE TIME NECESSARY TO ROUTE RID VISIT THIS AND OTHER INVESTMENTS TO DO SO THESE ARE GENERATIONAL INVESTMENTS AND WE SHOULD NOT LOOK BACK AND WONDER WHETHER THE OUTCOMES MATCH THE INTENDED GOALS OR WHETHER WE SQUANDERED THIS OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS LEVINE MR SANTIAGO. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THANK ALL OUR COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR COMMENTS AND PARTICIPATION IN GETTING THIS DONE THE BUDGET CHAIR- WHO IS THE CENTER OF THE PROCESS AND- ALSO- TO THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE BECAUSE WHEN WE BEGAN THE YEAR. HE TALKED ABOUT THE YOUR BROADBAND AND HERE WE ARE AT THE AT THE CULMINATION OF THE BUDGET. IMPLEMENTING A GAME CHANGING INITIATIVES IN THIS IN THIS BILL. N. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT INFORMATION IN THE DEMOCRATIZING OF INFORMATION THIS REALLY WILL BE A GAME CHANGER ALLOWS THAT TO HAPPEN BOTH RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES FROM A COST POINT PERSPECTIVE TO AN ACCESS PERSPECTIVE I THINK THIS CHANGES OUR LIVES IN MORE WAYS THAN WE CAN IMAGINE FROM THE ONSET. AND THIS PANDEMIC TAUGHT US. PART OF WHAT WAS NEEDED WHEN WE SAW LITTLE KIDS IN FRONT AND FRONT OF A- A PART OF A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT. TRYING TO GAIN ACCESS BUT ALSO TAUGHT US- IT ALSO TAUGHT US THAT WE CAN DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY I CAN NEIGHBORHOODS I REPRESENT FOR TELEHEALTH BECAME MORE IMPORTANT. I TEASE WHERE EDUCATION BECAME. WHAT WELL IMPORTANT TO STAND THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S CONNECTION WHAT WE SAW THE DIGITAL VIDE. CRASH ACROSS CALIFORNIA. I DON'T THINK WE CAN UNDERESTIMATE HOW IMPORTANT IS THIS I DO AGREE THAT WE'VE GOT TO GET THIS RIGHT. BUT THIS IS THIS WILL BE A GAME CHANGER FOR ALLOWING US TO HAVE THAT MIDDLE MILE FROM ALLOWING US TO HAVE THOSE LAST POINTS OF CONNECTION AND ALLOWING US TO BE ABLE TO. THE FINALLY HAVE BROADBAND FOR ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO I THINK THIS HOUSE. I THINK I SPEAK AGAIN FOR HELPING US TO PUT THIS TOGETHER BECAUSE THIS WILL BE THAT GAME CHANGER WE'LL LOOK BACK YEARS FROM NOW AND UNDERSTAND WHY ALL CALIFORNIA HAS.

THE BILL MAKES SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN REALLY IS OVER A DECADE'S WORTH OF ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF MANY OF THE LEGISLATURE LEGISLATORS HERE. IN IN THE ROOM BEEN FIGHTING FOR EXPANDED CHILD CARE SLOTS FOR RATE REFORM SO THAT MANY OF THE CHILD CARE PROVIDERS WHO GET PAID VERY LOW WAGES. CAN NOW HAVE A LIVING WAGE WHILE THEY'RE TAKING CARE OF OUR CHILDREN WE KNOW HOW CRITICAL IT IS TO HAVE CONSISTENT AND AFFORDABLE CHILD CARE BECAUSE IF YOU CAN'T. HAVE CHILD CARE YOU CAN'T GO TO WORK LIKE MY FAMILY AND MANY SO MANY OTHER FAMILIES IF WE DON'T HAVE CHILD CARE. MANY OF US COULD BE HERE TODAY. THIS EXPANDS OUR CHILD CARE SLOTS BEGINNING THIS YEAR BY A HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND WITH ADDING TWENTY THOUSAND A YEAR.

EARLY CHILDCARE. AND THAT WILL BE A BETTER COURT AND AT THAT THERE WILL ALSO BE BETTER COORDINATION AMONG VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS PROVIDING THESE NEEDED SERVICES. THIS BILL PROVIDES TWO YEARS OF FUNDING USING ONE TIME FUNDS FOR MORE CHILD CARE OPENINGS BUT FACES. UNCERTAIN FUNDING IN THE FUTURE IN THE FUTURE I WOULD CAUTION THAT THIS BILL USES THE ONE TIME FUNDS A GREAT NEW AND ONGOING OBLIGATIONS. YOU MUST COMMIT TO SUSTAIN FUNDING FOR CALIFORNIA FAMILIES AND CHILDREN TO PROVIDE THEM THE CERTAINTY THEY NEED THE Y. URGENT AND I VOTE ON AB ONE THIRTY ONE. THANK YOU MR FONG MR GRAYSON. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB ONE THIRTY ONE. AND A EARLY EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION IS IMPERATIVE IT'S VITAL TO A HEALTHY FUTURE. AND I APPLAUD ALL THAT HAVE WORKED SO HARD. TO EXPAND EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION TO ALL BUT IN DOING SO WE HAVE CREATED A TWO TIER SYSTEM THAT HAS. RESULTED IN DOUBLE STANDARDS. MOVING FORWARD BY PUTTING THIS ALL UNDER A- A SINGLE RATE- OR- REIMBURSEMENT RATE- IT IS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. HOWEVER THERE ARE OTHER AREAS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND I ASK FOR YOUR PARTNERSHIP MOVING INTO THE- INTO THE FUTURE. ON ADDRESSING THE DESPAIR DISPARITIES THAT COMES TO THIS TWO TIER SYSTEM. AND AND- THE DOUBLE STANDARD THAT EXISTS FROM IT. I DO RISE IN SUPPORT AND ASK FOR YOUR ARRIVAL. THANK MISS GRAYSON MS GARCIA. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MEMBERS I RISE ON BEHALF OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS. IN SUPPORT OF AB ONE THIRTY ONE BEFORE. ANY OF US GOT HERE THE LIMITS CAUCUS HAS BEEN CHAMPIONING THE SPACE. WE KNOW THAT BEFORE THE PANDEMIC THIS I FEEL WAS UNDERPAID AND UNDERVALUED MOSTLY PREDOMINATELY WOMEN WHEN A WOMAN OF COLOR FIELD. TAKING CARE OF OUR MOST PRECIOUS. ASSETS AND FUTURE OF THEIR CHILDREN ARE EARLY ON AND THERE YEARS AND WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING TO INCREASE RATES WILL INCREASE OF FIGHTING TO INCREASE LOTS FOR OVER A DECADE. AND SO EXCITING THAT TODAY WE ARE FINALLY SEEING THAT RATE INCREASE EVERYTHING ADDITIONAL SLOTS. BUT LIKE MY COLLEAGUES IN THE BAY AREA SAID THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE INTO THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS IS COMMITTED TO ENSURE WE VALUE THESE CARE WORKERS WHAT I'LL BE DOING THE IMPORTANT WORK OF. HELPING TO MOLD OUR CHILDREN TO OUR FUTURE LEADERS I INTO ENSURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO INCLUDE MORE FAMILIES IN THIS SPACE. I WANT TO THANK ALL THE CHAMPIONS IN THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS HAVE BEEN ADVOCATE IN THE SPACE WE NOT ONLY HAVE NEW SLOTS AND RATE REFORM WE ARE ALSO WAITING FAMILY FEES THANKS TO THE LEADERS OF OUR QUALITY CONTAMINATED YOU KNOW. WE ARE DOING ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM THANKS OUR COLLEAGUES FROM FULLER TEN WE ARE MMHM. I DO KNOW A LOT MORE DOING INFRASTRUCTURE AND SAID THIS IS A COLLECTIVE EFFORT IS AN EFFORT THAT.

THEIR YOUR- THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB ONE THIRTY ONE- THIS PAST YEAR WE HAVE LOST SO MANY PROVIDERS- BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. AND WE'VE LOST WORK FORCE WE'VE LOST CHILD CARE SLOTS. AND I TOO AM ONE OF THOSE LEGISLATORS THAT HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR EXPANDED ACCESS TO CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL FOR OVER A DECADE. I'M REALLY EXCITED TO SUPPORT THIS. TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SLOTS. IS AMAZING- IT I APPLAUD WHAT WE'RE DOING I DO HAVE ONE CONCERN THOUGH BECAUSE WE'RE NOT DONE YET. THERE IS NO MONEY IN THIS BUDGET. ADDITIONAL MONEY OR THE MONEY THAT WE NEED FOR THE WORK FORCE. A TRADITIONAL- RATIO AND A CHILD CARE SETTING IS ONE TO SIX OR ONE TO TWELVE. WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO. TO FILL TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SLOTS. WE'RE GONNA NEED THOUSANDS OF NEW CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. AND NOT REQUIRES DEVELOPING OUR WORKFORCE SO WE'RE NOT DONE. WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THAT MOVING FORWARD. I'M BUT I DO ASK YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. MR MCCARTY. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I WOULD SAY THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TRAILER BILLS THAT WERE VOTING ON PIECES OF THE BUDGET- IS CERTAINLY A TOP PRIORITY FOR US DURING THE- PANDEMIC AND FRANKLY EVERY YEAR. WE CAN'T HAVE A THRIVING ECONOMY WE CANNOT- PEOPLE GOING TO WORK. UNLESS WE HAVE. A FUNCTIONING CHILD CARE SYSTEMS AND WE LOOK ABOUT OUR ECONOMIC FUTURE IF YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THE THAT SHE MEANT GAP. INTERGENERATIONAL POVERTY THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE EVERY ECONOMIST SAYS ONE THING. INVEST MORE IN OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS WILL THIS DOES JUST THAT AS PART OF AN OVERALL PUZZLE. AS OUR BUDGET SHARE NOTED. THIS IS THE EARLY EDUCATION BUDGET THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DREAMING ABOUT FOR FRANKLY DECADES OVER SIX POINT FIVE. BILLION DOLLARS IN ONGOING SUPPORT TO EXPAND ACCESS FOR CHILD. RICKLY THE BIGGEST PIECE THE PIECE WHILE WE HELD UP THE BUDGET LAST TWO WEEKS IS TO MAKE SURE WE PAY PROPER RATES. FOR ALL OF THESE CENTER BASED IN FAMILY BASED PROGRAMS TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE ECONOMICALLY VIABLE. AND TO MAKE SURE THEY PAY THEIR WORKERS LIVING WAGES. SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN THIS MEANS THAT CURRENTLY THERE ARE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE ON THE WAITING LIST TO GET CHILD CARE. AT THIS BUDGET IS IMPLEMENTED WITH THE SLOTS OF THEIR BUDGETARY LIT TWO. HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND NOW TWENTY THOUSAND MORE FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS. THE WAITING LIST FOR FAMILIES WILL BE CUT IN HALF. SO THOSE FAMILIES CAN GO BACK TO WORK GO TO SCHOOL. AND BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES. AS FAR AS- OVERALL PUBLICLY FUNDED SLOTS FOR CHILD CARE STATE PRESCHOOL NTK OVER HALF A MILLION. AGAIN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND WE WANT ALL THESE ARE OUR NUMBERS IN BILLIONS OF MILLIONS BUT THINK ABOUT PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS WILL NOT HAVE FREE. PUBLICLY FUNDED. EARLY CHILD EDUCATION FULL DAY PROGRAMS TO HELP THEIR FAMILIES SIXTY. THIS IS A WIN WIN WIN FOR CALIFORNIA AGAIN. TOP PRIORITY FOR OUR SUBCOMMITTEE BUT ALSO FOR THE ENTIRE LEGISLATURE REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS OF THIS IS AN ISSUE WE NEED TO FOCUS ON. LEAD BE OCCUPIERS SPEAKER OUR BUDGET SHARE AND AGAIN OR LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS LED BY. OUR CHAIRMAN FROM THE SOUTH L. A. COUNTY THANK YOU FOR AT EVERYBODY SUPPORT OF THIS.

ASSEMBLY BILL ONE THIRTY TWO BY THE COMMITTEE ON BUDGET AND ACTIVATING THE POST SECONDARY EDUCATION A MAKING A PROBATIONER FOR STICK FOR COMMUNITY ABILITY TO THE BUDGET. MISTER K. THANK YOU BUT SPEAKER AB ONE THIRTY TWO IS A HIGHER EDUCATION TRAILER BILL LIKE SOMEBODY WITH OTHER TRAILER BILL TO REALLY LAYS THE FOUNDATION FOR HIGHER EDUCATION IN OUR STATE. FOR THE FORTHCOMING FUTURE. THIS BILL EXPANDS CAL GRANTS TO MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND. LOW INCOME COMMUNICATIONS BY ELIMINATING. THESE BARRIERS TO THE- PROGRAM. EXPANDS REFORMS ARE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP. IT DIRECTS THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA TO REDUCE THE OUT OF STATE ENROLLMENT DOWN 218% AT UCLA UC BERKELEY UC SAN DIEGO. IT ALSO EXPANDS OUR STATE COLLEGE SAVINGS PROGRAM. TIRES THE DEFERRALS FOR ALL THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT WERE CREATED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. INCREASE A NEW REQUIREMENT THAT HIGH SCHOOLS MUST ENSURE THAT SENIORS. FILL OUT FINANCIAL AID APPLICATIONS THIS. TRAILER BILL CONTINUES ALL THE WORK THAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING TO INCREASE ACCESS TO MAKE SURE THE HIGHER EDUCATION AFFORDABLE FOR EVERY CALIFORNIA WITHOUT A RESPECT RESTAURANT ADULT ON AB ONE THIRTY TWO. THINGS CHANGE MR FONG. I THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER THERE'S NO DOUBT HIGHER EDUCATION PROVIDES A GATEWAY TO SUCCESS THIS BILL INCLUDES NEEDED INVESTMENTS IN OUR UC AND CSU SYSTEMS AND FINALLY PAYS ALCHEMY COLLEGE DEFERRALS. OUR STATE COLLEGES ARE GEARING UP FOR A MONUMENTAL RETURN TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AND MORE SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS IS GREATLY NEEDED WE SHOULD BE EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR SUCCESS BUT THIS BILL. WOULD RESTRICT ATTENDANCE OPTIONS AND AGAIN EXCLUDE CHARTER SCHOOLS FROM ACCESSING TOOLS THAT THEY COULD USE TO HELP THEIR STUDENTS UNFORTUNATELY I CANNOT SUPPORT. THIS BILL TODAY BECAUSE OF THAT. THANK YOU MR FONG WISH MCCARTY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER. SPEAKER THIS AS OUR BUDGET SHARE NUDE NOTED IS AGAIN THIS IS A HISTORIC BUDGET WE KEEP SAYING THIS IS THE LARGEST INCREASE FOR ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY. FOR COLLEGE. IN GENERATIONS FOR THE STATE LEGISLATURE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IF YOU GO BACK HOME AND TALK TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS ABOUT HIGHER EDUCATION WHAT THEY TALK ABOUT. TWO THINGS HOW COLLEGES TOO EXPENSIVE. HOW THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS ARE GRADUATING WITH TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE THE STUDENT DEBT. WELL THE OTHER THING YOU HEAR IS HOW THEIR NEIGHBOR THEIR LOVED ONE. HAS A FOUR POINT FIVE GPA. IS APPLIED TO THE UC. NEEDS TO GO TO UNIVERSITY OREGON OR SOMEWHERE ELSE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET INTO OUR PUBLICLY FUNDED COLLEGES. WE ARE TAXPAYERS AND WE'RE SQUEEZING OUT CALIFORNIANS. WELL NO MORE WE ARE REDUCING THE NUMBER OF NON RESIDENT STUDENTS SO MORE AND MORE ACCESS FOR THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES. AS FAR AS FINANCIAL AID THE STUDENT DEBT CRISIS. THIS THIS BILL IMPLEMENTS THE WORK THAT ARE BUT OUR HIGHER ED SHARE. FROM RIVERSIDE HAS BEEN WORKING ON FOR MANY YEARS WITH OUR BUDGETARY MYSELF. TO BRING ABOUT A DEBT FREE COLLEGE IN CALIFORNIA THAT IS NOT. SOMETHING THAT IS A- YOU KNOW WAY OUT THERE IN THE FUTURE THIS LAYS THE WORK TO MAKE COLLEGE DEBT FREE IN CALIFORNIA NOT FREE. DEBT FREE CELL BASED UPON YOUR FAMILY INCOME. YOUR EXISTING FINANCIAL AID YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GRADUATE. WITHOUT HAVING THIS MOUNTING STUDENT DEBT AND WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THE STUDENTS WORK THE TRADITIONAL FIFTEEN HOURS A WEEK TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. SO WITH THIS IS THE FIRST STEP OF THAT ALLOW OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS TO GET SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL AID. TO PAY FOR NON TUITION COSTS WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE THIS. RISING STUDENT DEBT CRISIS AND LASTLY FOR SO MANY STUDENTS ARE A COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS THEY APPLY FOR THE CALTRAIN AS WE KNOW.AND THEY GET IN A LOTTERY ONLY ONE IN FOURTEEN GET TO GET THE ELUSIVE CAL GRANT A WORD WITH THIS WE'RE GOING TO ELIMINATE THAT BARRIER AND OPEN WIDE OPEN THE DOORS OF HIGHER EDUCATION. FOR NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS AT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT IS A GAME CHANGER FOR ACCESS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION IN OUR STATE THAT WILL CHANGE LIVES SO THAT WILL HAVE AN AUTOMATIC ELIGIBILITY IF THEY HAVE THE INCOME ELIGIBILITY. AND OF COURSE THEY'RE QUALIFIED TO GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE SO THIS IS THE FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE THAT AGAIN WE'VE ALL BEEN WORKING OUT. FOR OVER A DECADE WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. DAMOS MCCARTY MISTER NAZARIAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES I WAS VERY CIRCUMSPECT BECAUSE WE'RE WE'RE VOTING ON MANY DIFFERENT BUDGET ITEMS ONE BETTER THAN THE OTHER AND SO I WAS CIRCUMSPECT ON WHICH ONE I WAS GOING TO CHOOSE TO SPEAK ON AND THIS WAS IT. THIS IS I WANTED TO FIRST OF ALL THANK THE BUDGET CHAIR AS WELL AS THE BUDGETS- EDUCATION SUB CHAIR- ON ON SUPPORTING AND JOINING ON BOARD EARLY ON IN THE CHILDREN'S SAVINGS ACCOUNT PROGRAM WANTED TO ALSO THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION ON THE WONDERFUL WORK THAT THEY DID. IN THE COLLABORATION COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MOVE THIS FORWARD. FOLKS WE'RE VOTING ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT ITEMS THAT QUITE CANDIDLY ARE WONDERFUL BUT THE REACTIVE WERE ALWAYS FALLING BEHIND AND WE'RE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO CATCH UP. WE HEAR ABOUT COMMENTS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IT WE'RE LIVING IN A CALIFORNIA TWO DIFFERENT CALIFORNIA'S OR ABOUT INVESTING IN OUR YOUTH OR CONNECTING RURAL AND POOR AREAS TO THE REST OF THE STATE BECAUSE- OF THE IN INADEQUACIES AND- THAT THAT ARE. BROADBAND AND UTILITY PROGRAMS HAVE. THE CHILDREN SAVINGS ACCOUNT IS ONE PROGRAM THAT IT'S NOT A REACTION. IT IS ACTUALLY AN INVESTMENT TO THE FUTURE. EVERY CHILD BORN IN CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO START OUT WITH AN ACCOUNT. IN THEIR SAVING IN IN THE FIVE TWENTY NINE PLAN. BY THE TIME THEY'RE IN FIRST GRADE IF THEY ARE FROM A POOR SOCIOECONOMIC FAMILY. THEY WILL GET AN ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING. AND BY FIRST GRADE THEY WILL HAVE OVER FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN THEIR ACCOUNT WHICH FOR THE NEXT TWELVE YEARS WILL GROW TO A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN ACTUALLY HAVE A MEANINGFUL AMOUNT APPLY TOWARDS THEIR- CAREER ENHANCING OPPORTUNITY MAY BE VOCATIONAL TRAINING TECH TECHNICAL TRAINING COLLEGE WHEREVER IT MAY BE. IT'S PROGRAMS LIKE THIS THAT ARE GIVING DIRECT INVESTMENTS BACK INTO OUR YOUTH THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE A CRITICAL THAT ARE GONNA MAKE A CRITICAL DIFFERENCE.

NAME IS GABRIEL MISTER BLOOM. YOUR ADDRESS THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT IF I JUST BEEN STATED BY OUR COLLEAGUE FROM THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY FROM ORANGE COUNTY AND- FROM OUR BUDGET CHEN BUYER BUDGET CHAIR. OF THIS BILL IS A MOMENTOUS ACHIEVEMENT IN THE FIGHT AGAINST HOMELESSNESS FOR THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE MULTI YEAR FUNDING FOR OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE ON THE FRONT LINES AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL MAKE THIS PROGRAM. PERMANENT HOMELESSNESS IS A STATEWIDE CRISIS AND WE NEED A ROBUST STATEWIDE RESPONSE AS HAS UNFORTUNATELY BEEN FREQUENTLY OBSERVED LOS ANGELES IS THE EPICENTER OF THIS CRISIS AND- L. A. COUNTY WAS ONE OF THE FEW JURISDICTIONS THAT THAT A POINT TIME COUNT TWENTY TWENTY. THAT SHOWED AN INCREASE OF 13% FROM TWENTY NINETEEN. AS WE LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR THE THIRD AND FOURTH ROUNDS OF THIS PROGRAM AND HOPEFULLY A PERMANENT PROGRAM. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FUNDING FORMULAS ARE RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS IN OUR COMMUNITIES WHERE THE CRISIS EXISTS. MANY OF US IN THE ALLEY REGION OF EXPRESSED CONCERNS OVER THE CAPS IN THIS BILL ON THE ALLOCATIONS IT WOULD GO TO THE LA AREA. IF HOMELESSNESS GROWS IN LOS ANGELES THAN OUR STATE PROGRAM SHOULD RESPOND TO THAT NEED AND BE ABLE TO BE NIMBLE SO THAT OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN HAVE THE RESOURCES. THAT THEY NEED TO GET PEOPLE HOUSING AND SERVICES. SO I HOPE WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO FIND A SOLUTION TO ENSURE THAT THIS FUNDING IS DISTRIBUTED EQUITABLY. AND RESPONSIVE TO THE CHANGING NEEDS ON THE GROUND AS WE MOVE FORWARD. I AM PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS HISTORIC LEGISLATION AND THE MANY IMPROVEMENTS IN THIS- ITERATION OF THE PROGRAM INCLUDING THE BONUS POTS OF FUNDING FOR PERFORMING JURISDICTIONS THAT WILL BRING RESOURCES AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THANK YOU ASHLEE MISTER DAVID CHIU YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

INCLUDING TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR FLEXIBLE FUNDING TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS AS WE KNOW IN RECENT YEARS AS SIGNIFICANT FUNDS HAVE BEEN SPENT AROUND THE STATE TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. POLICYMAKERS AND THE PUBLIC HAVE SHARED A COMMON FRUSTRATION OF WONDERING HOW THIS MONEY IS ACTUALLY IMPACTING THE CRISIS ON OUR STREETS AND IT'S CRITICAL THAT IN AB ONE FORTY THIS BILL REQUIRED THAT ARE HOMELESSNESS INVESTMENTS HAVE MORE COUNT ABILITY THAN EVER BEFORE LET ME JUST DELINEATES SOME OF THEM. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL BE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT LOCAL HOMELESSNESS ACTION PLANS INCLUDE ASSESSMENTS OF EXISTING RESOURCES AND DESCRIBE HOW STATE FUNDING WILL FILL GAPS. CITIES COUNTIES AND CONTINUES OF CARE WILL NEED TO ESTABLISH OUTCOME GOALS AND MEET THOSE GOALS TO ACCESS ADDITIONAL FUNDING. THIS BILL CREATES REAL INCENTIVES FOR COUNTIES IN CONTINUUM'S OF CARE TO APPLY FOR FUNDING TOGETHER AND GIVEN THE MANY STATE AGENCIES INVOLVED STATE AGENCIES WILL BE REQUIRED TO IDENTIFY EXISTING RESOURCES STATEWIDE THAT ADDRESS THE CRISIS. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP TO ACCOUNTABILITY WHEN IT COMES TO HOMELESSNESS BUT WE ALL KNOW THERE IS MORE WORK TO DO. WITH THE INFORMATION THAT WE RECEIVE FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND STATE AGENCIES WILL BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY RESOURCES NEEDED TO SOLVE HOMELESSNESS. WE NEED TO REMAIN DILIGENT SO THAT THIS HISTORIC INVESTMENT SUPPORTS EVIDENCE BASED SOLUTIONS AND PRODUCES RESULTS WE KNOW THAT pREAL ACCOUNTABILITY WILL REQUIRE DILIGENCE ON THE PART OF BOTH THE STATE. AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND WE ALL APPRECIATE THAT SOLVING HOMELESSNESS IS NOT JUST PROVIDING TEMPORARY SHELTER THE BUILDING PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I WANNA TAKE A MOMENT AND THANK OUR BUDGET LEADERSHIP THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO MOVE THIS FORWARD. AND VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION ON THIS ISSUE. WE ARE ALL COMMITTED TO A LONG TERM INVESTMENT AND ONGOING RESOURCES AND WE NEED TO DO THIS.

YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB ONE THIRTY THREE BECAUSE IT ALLOWS MEDICARE PATIENTS TO CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS TO TELEHEALTH FLEXIBILITIES FOR ONE MORE YEAR AND I WANT TO THANK THE BUDGET AND SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIRS AND THE HEALTH POLICY CHAIR FOR HELPING DELIVER WHAT WE COULD THIS YEAR. FOLLOWING THESE FLEXIBILITIES REMAIN PATIENTS CAN CONTINUE TO SEE THEIR PROVIDERS CREATING A BRIDGE TOOK EXPAND ACCESS IN MORE NORMAL TIMES. HOWEVER THIS IS NOT A PERMANENT SOLUTION AND I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DO MORE DURING THE SESSION. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THROUGH AB THIRTY TWO I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH A BROAD COALITION OF SAFETY NET CLINICS PATIENT ADVOCATES HEALTH PROFESSIONALS HOSPITALS AND BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEES. TO ENSURE THAT TELEHEALTH FLEXIBILITIES BECOME PERMANENT AFTER THE PANDEMIC. THROUGH THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS CALLED OUT IN AB ONE THIRTY THREE AND I CONTINUE TO WORK ON AB THIRTY TWO WE NEED TO LOCK IN ACCESS TO ALL TELEHEALTH MODALITIES. THAT WERE CRITICAL TO PEOPLE GETTING HEALTH CARE SERVICES DURING THE PANDEMIC. WE NEED TO COLLECT DATA TO ENSURE QUALITY AND THE BEST HEALTH OUTCOMES.

YES COVERAGE THAT IS AFFORDABLE AND QUALITY THANK YOU. THANKS FRIEDMAN DR WOULD YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS- THIS IS A BIG BILL AND THERE IS A LOT TO LOVE ABOUT THIS BILL MAKES A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT CHANGES INCLUDING A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT SICK SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. INCLUDING ULTIMATELY ELIMINATING THE ASSET TEST ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT TO CALL OUT THIS BILL WHICH WAS MENTIONED BY OUR OF OUR BUDGET CHAIR FROM SAN FRANCISCO IS THAT IS THAT IT IMPLEMENTS GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S CALIFORNIA ADVANCING AND INNOVATING MEDIC CAL PROPOSAL ALSO KNOWN AS CAROLYN. KELLY WILL MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO IMPROVE THE MEDICARE PROGRAM THESE INCLUDE IMPROVING HOW SERVICES ARE DELIVERED TO SENIORS PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDER ENSURING THE PEOPLE LEAVING CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES RECEIVE A WARM HAND OFF AND ENROLLED IN COVERAGE. IT ALSO EXPANDS THE SERVICES THAT MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS CAN PROVIDE TO ADDRESS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND ADDRESS HIGH NEEDS POPULATION I WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE- THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICE LEADERSHIP. TEAM FOR THEIR YEARS OF WORK IN PUTTING THIS TOGETHER IN PARTICULAR I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE WORK OF DIRECTOR WILL LIFE FORM AND J. C. COOPER THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR WHO IS THE LEAD ARCHITECT OF THIS PROPOSAL. BUT THERE'S A PIECE MISSING IN THIS PROPOSAL IN THIS IN THIS BILL AND THAT'S AROUND AFFORDABILITY. THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT PROPOSAL THAT I HOPE WILL COME UP- IN AUGUST SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT. EIGHT OUT OF TEN CALIFORNIANS BELIEVE THAT. HELP THE COST OF HEALTHCARE IS EITHER EXTREMELY IMPORTANT OR VERY IMPORTANT AND IF CALLED UPON THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR TO MAKE MOVE SOMETHING FORWARD. THERE IS A PROPOSAL AROUND HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT EVERYBODY IS IN THE MORE PEOPLE WHO GET LEFT LET OUT OF THIS POLICY. WILL GREATLY DIMINISH THE ABILITY FOR THAT TO BE EFFECTIVEWE OWE IT TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AND NOT JUST THE PEOPLE THAT ARE BENEFITING FROM STATE PROGRAMS BUT EVERYONE ELSE. TO FIND A WAY TO KEEP THE COST OF HEALTH CARE MORE AFFORDABLE. HEALTH CARE CONTINUES TO RISE AT TWICE THE RATE OF INFLATION. AND WITH INFLATION INCREASING NOW. START HERE MORE AND MORE ABOUT INFLATION INCREASING YOU'RE GOING TO SEE MORE AND MORE RISES IN THE COST OF HEALTH CARE. CONSUMERS CAN'T AFFORD IT. WE NEED TO DO BETTER AND I HOPE THAT IN AUGUST WILL BE ABLE TO VOTE ON THAT PIECE OF THE PUZZLE. GOING FORWARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH I. FOR DR ARAMBULA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS TODAY I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB ONE THIRTY THREE THIS YEAR'S HEALTH TRAILER BILL- AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THIS BILL TAKES EXTRAORDINARY STEPS TO ADDRESS HEALTH DISPARITIES WHICH ARE CAUSED BY SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH BY CHANGING THE VERY SYSTEM THAT A THIRD OF ALL CALIFORNIANS RELY ON FOR HEALTH CARE. BY STREAMLINING TRANSFORMING AND FOUNDATION WE CHANGING THE MEDICAL SYSTEM IN THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCING AND INNOVATING MEDICAL. CALLING WILL INVEST IN POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT WILL WHICH WILL ALLOW US TO PRIORITIZE WELLNESS AND PREVENTIVE SERVICES IT WILL ALSO ALLOW US TO IDENTIFY AND MITIGATE MANY OF THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. IT ALSO WILL SUPPORT IN LIEU OF SERVICES WHICH WILL ALLOW US TO HAVE SERVICES LIKE HOUSING TRANSITION NAVIGATION SERVICES OR ASTHMA REMEDIATION OR HOUSING DEPOSITS OR MEDICALLY TAILORED MEALS THAT WILL BETTER ALLOW US TO TAKE CARE OF OUR COMMUNITIES. IT ALSO WILL INVEST INTO AN ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT WHICH IS AN ABILITY FOR US TO HAVE A WHOLE PERSON CARE. WHICH MANY OF YOU IN YOUR COUNTIES HAVE BUT THIS WILL ALLOW US TO EQUITABLY APPLY IT TO THE REMAINDER OF THE STATE. FURTHER IT CHANGES THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM FOR ADULTS BUT I WANT TO CALL OUT IN AGREES ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE INVESTMENTS IN OUR CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE. THIS BILL WILL ALSO INVEST IN THE HEALTH CAREER OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM. WHICH IS WILL ADDRESS THE URGENT AND GROWING NEED IN OUR STATES TO EXPAND THE POOL OF TALENTED DIVERSE. HEALTH WORKERS AND TO CONNECT THEM MORE EFFECTIVELY IN ALL OF OUR STATE. I AM THRILLED THAT THIS BUDGET SUPPORTS HEALTH FOR ALL AND EXPANDING FULL SCOPE MEDICAL COVERAGE TO THOSE WHO ARE OVER THE AGE OF FIFTY. IT IS CRITICAL THAT OUR STATE NOW PROTECT ALL LOWER INCOME CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY WERE BORN. THE HEALTH OF EACH OF US IS DEPENDENT ON THE HEALTH OF ALL OF US AND THIS IS A BUDGET THAT BUILDS BACK BOLDLY BY INVESTING IN ALL CALIFORNIANS.

AS MANY OF YOU KNOW IN RECENT MONTHS THE UNMARKED GRAVES IN MORE THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED NATIVE CHILDREN WERE UNCOVERED AT INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS ACROSS CANADA. THE HISTORY WE LEARNED IN SCHOOLS ARE ALL TOO OFTEN GLOSSED OVER THE ATROCITIES PERPETRATED AGAINST OUR NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES IN THE FIRST NATIONS WITH THE CIVILIAN FIND ACT OF EIGHTEEN NINETEEN CONGRESS SOUGHT TO ASSIMILATE INTO RACE NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURE. BY SEPARATING NATIVE CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS AND SENDING THEM TO BOARDING SCHOOLS FOR THE PURPOSE OF FORCED ASSIMILATION FAMILY MEMBERS ARE OFTEN NOT INFORMED WHEN THE NATIVE CHILDREN AT THESE SCHOOLS FELL ILL AND EVEN DIED AND EVEN WHEN ENQUIRIES ABOUT THEIR WELL BEING WERE MADE.
