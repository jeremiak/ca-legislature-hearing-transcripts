A RESOURCE FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS

00:21:11.069 --> 00:21:12.237
AN EXTRA SOURCE OF INCOME FOR

00:21:14.473 --> 00:21:15.240

00:21:15.307 --> 00:21:16.241
HOWEVER THERE IS A SHIFT IN THE

00:31:23.181 --> 00:31:24.382
FROM THEIR JOBS.

00:31:24.449 --> 00:31:25.583
JUST BECAUSE FORMALLY AFFORDABLE

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:27.885

WE TALKED ABOUT THE THE THE

00:31:30.655 --> 00:31:31.923
PROVISION TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:33.258

00:31:33.324 --> 00:31:35.059
ARE PAID.

NOW T. O. T. IS FOR THOSE FROM

00:31:36.728 --> 00:31:37.595
LOCAL GOVERNMENT NO IT'S ONE OF

00:31:37.662 --> 00:31:39.330

00:32:04.422 --> 00:32:06.791
AT A HOTEL IN BED AND BREAKFAST.

00:32:06.858 --> 00:32:07.325
IT ALSO DENIES CITIES AND

00:32:07.392 --> 00:32:08.326
COUNTIES A LOT OF NEEDED REVENUE

00:32:08.393 --> 00:32:10.361
WHICH IS WHAT WHY THIS BILL

00:32:10.428 --> 00:32:12.730
MANDATES THAT THE PLATFORM

AB SEVEN THIRTY THIRTY ONE DOES

00:34:58.096 --> 00:34:59.397
THE EXACT OPPOSITE.

00:34:59.464 --> 00:35:00.731
IT TARGETS A PLATFORM TO DO

00:35:00.798 --> 00:35:02.266
FOLLOW THE RULES AND ENHANCES

00:35:02.333 --> 00:35:03.668
THE PLATFORMS THAT FOSTER THE

00:35:03.734 --> 00:35:04.669
BAD ACTORS.

00:35:04.735 --> 00:35:07.038
LET ME FURTHER EXPLAIN.

00:35:07.104 --> 00:35:08.139
IN CITIES AND COUNTIES ACROSS

00:35:08.206 --> 00:35:09.440

NEIGHBORHOOD GROUPS AND

00:35:13.811 --> 00:35:14.812

THAT MEETS LOCAL NEEDS IN MANY

00:35:18.049 --> 00:35:19.517
CASES PLATFORMS ENDORSED

00:35:19.584 --> 00:35:20.685
SIGNIFICANT LIMITS ON SHORT TERM

00:35:20.751 --> 00:35:22.353
RENTALS THESE ARE THE GOOD

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:23.988
ACTORS.

00:35:24.055 --> 00:35:25.089

THIRTY DAYS EACH DOES NOTHING

00:35:27.725 --> 00:35:29.193
POSITIVE AND ONLY ENCOURAGES

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:30.728
HOST TO LIST ON COUNTLESS OTHER

00:35:30.795 --> 00:35:32.763
PLATFORMS THAT ARE UNMONITORED.

UNREGULATED AND DO NOT COLLECT

00:35:35.199 --> 00:35:37.568
NOR PAY CITY TAXES.

00:35:37.635 --> 00:35:39.136
IF AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE WERE

00:35:39.203 --> 00:35:40.004
TO PASS IT WOULD END UP COSTING

00:35:40.071 --> 00:35:41.606
CITIES HUNDREDS OF MILLION

00:35:41.672 --> 00:35:43.574
DOLLARS OF LOST TAX REVENUE.

00:35:43.641 --> 00:35:45.042
AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE DOES

00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:46.410
EXACTLY OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE'VE

00:35:46.477 --> 00:35:47.879
BEEN WORKING TOWARDS FOR YEARS

00:35:47.945 --> 00:35:49.480
IT DISCOURAGES HOSTS FROM USING

00:35:49.547 --> 00:35:51.349
RESPONSIBLE PLATFORMS AND PUSHES

00:35:51.415 --> 00:35:53.084

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:55.786
ON MANNERED SHE'S ME UNMONITORED

00:35:55.853 --> 00:35:58.256
AND UNENFORCEABLE PLATFORMS.

00:35:58.322 --> 00:35:59.690
SECONDLY IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE

00:35:59.757 --> 00:36:01.092
THAT THIS BILL FOCUSES ON

00:36:01.158 --> 00:36:02.593
SEVERELY RESTRICTING IF NOT

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:04.195
COMPLETELY ELIMINATING ANY HOME

00:36:04.262 --> 00:36:06.063
FROM SHORT TERM RENTAL INVENTORY

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:07.732
THAT IS NOT A PRIMARY RESIDENCE.

00:36:07.798 --> 00:36:09.267
I RESPECTFULLY CHALLENGE THOSE

00:36:09.333 --> 00:36:10.368

HAS ANY RESEARCH BEEN DONE OR

00:36:14.605 --> 00:36:15.840
ANY DATA COLLECTED.

00:36:15.907 --> 00:36:17.608
REGARDING HOW MANY HOMES WOULD

00:36:17.675 --> 00:36:19.343
BE ELIMINATED AS A RESULT.

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:20.478
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE CURRENT

00:36:20.545 --> 00:36:21.746
SHORT TERM RENTAL INVENTORY

00:36:21.812 --> 00:36:23.381
WOULD QUALIFY AS A PRIMARY

00:36:23.447 --> 00:36:24.982
RESIDENCE AND WHAT PERCENTAGE AS

00:36:25.049 --> 00:36:26.951
A SECONDARY HOME?

00:36:27.018 --> 00:36:28.853
WITH THIS BILL I'M AT 85% OF THE

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.288

THE VACANCY RATE.

00:36:38.563 --> 00:36:39.997
IF X. AMOUNT OF HOMES WERE

00:36:40.064 --> 00:36:41.566
ELIMINATED SHORT TERM RENTALS

00:36:41.632 --> 00:36:43.067
WOULD THERE EVEN BE ENOUGH HOTEL

00:36:43.134 --> 00:36:46.070
ROOMS TO PROVIDE ACCOMMODATIONS

00:36:46.137 --> 00:36:46.671

I HEAR FROM I GUESS ALL THE TIME

00:37:04.021 --> 00:37:05.122
HOW THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO

AFFORD A BEACH VACATION IF THEY

00:37:06.157 --> 00:37:08.225
HAD TO RENT MULTIPLE HOTEL ROOMS.

00:37:08.292 --> 00:37:09.493
TO FIT THEIR FAMILIES OF

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:11.262
HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS PER NIGHT.

00:37:11.329 --> 00:37:12.396
SHORT TERM RENTALS PROVIDE AN

00:37:12.463 --> 00:37:13.931
AFFORDABLE OPTION FOR PEOPLE TO

VISIT THE BEACH AND IT'S

00:37:15.433 --> 00:37:15.967
IMPORTANT THAT WE PROTECT THAT

00:37:16.033 --> 00:37:18.102
RIGHT.

00:37:18.169 --> 00:37:19.003
OUR LOCAL ECONOMY WOULD BE

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:20.471

00:37:37.755 --> 00:37:38.956
INSTEAD OF BANNING VACATION

00:37:41.993 --> 00:37:43.527
EMBRACE SHORT TERM RENTALS AS

00:37:43.594 --> 00:37:45.129

UNFORTUNATELY AB SEVENTEEN

00:37:53.304 --> 00:37:54.605

00:37:54.672 --> 00:37:55.806
AS A VOTER IRISH OPPOSITION TO

00:37:55.873 --> 00:37:57.508

00:37:57.575 --> 00:37:58.009
I UNDERSTAND THIS IS A

00:37:58.075 --> 00:37:59.810
COMPLICATED ISSUE I HAVE BEEN

00:37:59.877 --> 00:38:01.145

00:38:14.091 --> 00:38:16.127
FIRST EVEN IN ITS AMENDED FORM

00:38:16.193 --> 00:38:18.496
WE REMAIN VERY CONCERNED THAT

00:38:18.562 --> 00:38:19.030
SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE WILL

00:38:19.096 --> 00:38:20.164
RESTRICT ACCESS TO THE CODES FOR

THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY UCLA AND

00:38:27.238 --> 00:38:28.372
THE COASTAL COMMISSION FOUND

00:38:28.439 --> 00:38:30.574
THAT AFFORDABLE OVERNIGHT

WITH A HIGHER RATE OF LATINO

00:38:39.717 --> 00:38:40.718
VOTERS AND FAMILIES WITH

CHILDREN CITING THIS AS A BIG

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:43.554
PROBLEM.

00:38:43.621 --> 00:38:45.289
IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE AVERAGE

00:38:45.356 --> 00:38:46.924
NIGHTLY PRICE PAID FOR AIRBNB

RENTALS WAS NINETY FIVE DOLLARS

00:38:48.526 --> 00:38:49.894
PER PERSON WHICH IS

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.162
APPROXIMATELY TWENTY DOLLARS

00:38:51.228 --> 00:38:53.030
LOWER THAN THE AVERAGE RATE IN

00:38:53.097 --> 00:38:54.398
THE COASTAL ZONE.

00:38:54.465 --> 00:38:56.767
AND THIRTY DOLLARS LOWER DURING

00:38:56.834 --> 00:38:58.235
THE SUMMER SEASON PER PERSON.

00:38:58.302 --> 00:39:00.037
THIS BILL BY ALLOWING CITIES TO

00:39:00.104 --> 00:39:01.305
PUT EVEN STRICTER LIMITS IN

00:39:01.372 --> 00:39:03.340
PLACE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY LEAD TO

00:39:03.407 --> 00:39:05.042
LESS ACCESS BY THESE FAMILIES TO

00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:06.110
THE COAST.

00:39:06.177 --> 00:39:07.645
SECOND THE BILL PUTS HOSTING

00:39:07.712 --> 00:39:08.679
PLATFORMS IN THE MIDDLE OF

00:39:08.746 --> 00:39:09.780
TENANT AND PROPERTY OWNER

00:39:09.847 --> 00:39:10.981
AGREEMENTS BY REQUIRING

00:39:11.048 --> 00:39:12.983

LISTING THEIR HOME.

00:39:15.686 --> 00:39:17.321
THIS IS UNTENABLE AND COMPLETELY

00:39:17.388 --> 00:39:18.956
UNWORKABLE CONSIDERING THAT SOME

00:39:19.023 --> 00:39:20.958
PROPERTY OWNERS MAY BE LOCATED

00:39:21.025 --> 00:39:22.860

00:39:24.528 --> 00:39:25.663
WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THESE

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:28.866
AGREEMENT SHOULD REMAIN BETWEEN

00:39:28.933 --> 00:39:30.434

SEVERAL CITIES IN SAN DIEGO

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.442
COUNTY TO COLLECT DOT JUST

00:39:38.509 --> 00:39:40.311
RECENTLY INCLUDING WITH THE CITY

00:39:40.377 --> 00:39:41.512
OF OCEANSIDE.

00:39:41.579 --> 00:39:43.147
AND LET ME POINT OUT THAT ALL

00:39:43.214 --> 00:39:45.649
CONTRACTS NEGOTIATED -- FOR TOT

00:39:45.716 --> 00:39:47.451
COLLECTION ALLOW FOR AUDITS BY

00:39:47.518 --> 00:39:48.586
THE CITY.

00:39:48.652 --> 00:39:50.020
THIS BILL WILL LIKELY REDUCE THE

00:39:50.087 --> 00:39:51.856
REVENUE THAT SOME OF THE CITIES

00:39:51.922 --> 00:39:53.724
ARE ALREADY RECEIVING ESPECIALLY

00:39:53.791 --> 00:39:55.359
IF THE CITY NOW ALLOWS MORE DAYS

00:39:55.426 --> 00:39:57.795
FOR VACATION HOMES TO BE RENTED.

00:39:57.862 --> 00:39:59.430
THAN WHAT THE BILL WOULD ALLOW.

00:39:59.497 --> 00:40:00.664
LASTLY WE WOULD LIKE TO POINT

00:40:00.731 --> 00:40:01.966
OUT THAT THE EXISTING LOCAL

00:40:02.032 --> 00:40:04.335
PROCESS CAN WORK HAS WORKED AND

00:40:04.401 --> 00:40:05.536
IS WORKING.

00:40:05.603 --> 00:40:06.904
SOME LOCAL ORDINANCES WERE

00:40:06.971 --> 00:40:08.639
APPROVED UPON INITIAL COASTAL

00:40:08.706 --> 00:40:10.374
COMMISSION REVIEW AND SOME MORE

00:40:10.441 --> 00:40:11.675
AMENDED BECAUSE THE COASTAL

00:40:11.742 --> 00:40:13.778
COMMISSION ARGUED THAT NOT

00:40:13.844 --> 00:40:15.212
ENOUGH ACCESS WAS BEING PROVIDED.

00:40:15.279 --> 00:40:16.680
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE CRAFTED

00:40:16.747 --> 00:40:18.115
ORDINANCES THAT REFLECT THEIR

00:40:18.182 --> 00:40:19.750
COMMUNITIES AND WE CONTINUE TO

00:40:19.817 --> 00:40:21.118
BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS SIMPLY

00:40:21.185 --> 00:40:22.586
UNNECESSARY.

00:40:22.653 --> 00:40:23.988

NOTHING TO PROTECT THE COASTLINE.

IF EXPLAIN TO BE THE LOCAL

00:41:24.048 --> 00:41:25.883
PROCESS AND WHY THAT

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:27.685
INSUFFICIENT AND AND STILL DOES

00:41:27.751 --> 00:41:28.919
YOUR PROPOSING THE BILL.

00:41:28.986 --> 00:41:31.255
SURE THIS BILL ACTUALLY

00:41:31.322 --> 00:41:33.057
MAINTAINS LOCAL CONTROL -- IN

00:41:33.123 --> 00:41:35.793
THE ISSUE OF THE FACT THAT --

00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:36.861
FULL TIME SHORT TERM VACATION

00:41:36.927 --> 00:41:38.128
RENTALS ARE REMOVING HOUSING

00:41:38.195 --> 00:41:39.897
FROM OUR HOUSING MARKET AND WE

00:41:39.964 --> 00:41:41.699
HAVE DETERMINED AS A LEGISLATURE

00:41:41.765 --> 00:41:42.800
THAT THE HOUSING PRICES OF

00:41:42.867 --> 00:41:45.703
STATEWIDE IMPORTANCE IMPORTANCE.

00:41:45.769 --> 00:41:47.171
AND SO IN ADDRESSING THAT AND

00:41:47.238 --> 00:41:49.506
SAN DIEGO COUNTY -- THIS BILL

00:41:49.573 --> 00:41:51.609
WOULD ABSOLUTELY ALLOW LOCAL

00:41:51.675 --> 00:41:53.043
CONTROL TO CONTINUE IF AS A

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:55.579
LOCAL JURISDICTION ONE TO ZONE

00:41:55.646 --> 00:41:58.649
THE AN AREA RESIDENTIAL TOURISM.

00:41:58.716 --> 00:42:00.184
WHICH EXPLICITLY ALLOWS IT IT

00:42:00.251 --> 00:42:04.889
WOULD BE THAT THE ALLOWS LOCAL

00:42:04.955 --> 00:42:07.358
CONTROL -- I OF WHERE OF THOSE --

00:42:07.424 --> 00:42:09.994
RESIDENTIAL TOURISM ZONES ARE --

00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:11.729
AND THE OTHER THING IS YOU KNOW

00:42:11.795 --> 00:42:13.964
THE THE THE NETWORK AROUND SHORT

00:42:14.031 --> 00:42:15.299
TERM VACATION RENTALS AND THE

00:42:15.366 --> 00:42:16.767
CAUSES OF THIS PARTICULARLY

00:42:16.834 --> 00:42:18.235
COMPLEX.

00:42:18.302 --> 00:42:18.802
BECAUSE YOU DO OF THE COSTA

00:42:18.869 --> 00:42:21.305
COMMISSION -- INVOLVED AT THE

00:42:21.372 --> 00:42:22.539
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS.

00:42:22.606 --> 00:42:24.375
YOU HAVE THE PLATFORMS OPERATE

00:42:24.441 --> 00:42:27.811
OUTSIDE OF THAT -- AS WELL AS

00:42:27.878 --> 00:42:29.813
INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY OWNERS AND

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.148
SO WE TRY TO CRAFT A PATH OF

00:42:31.215 --> 00:42:31.682
THIS BILL THAT PRESERVES

00:42:31.749 --> 00:42:33.817
PROPERTY RIGHTS I THINK AS ONE

00:42:33.884 --> 00:42:35.886
OF THE OPPONENTS EVEN STATED.

00:42:35.953 --> 00:42:37.488
LONG BEFORE THERE WAS AIRBNB --

00:42:37.554 --> 00:42:38.822
FOLKS ARE RENTING OUT SHORT TERM

00:42:38.889 --> 00:42:40.491
VACATION RENTALS AND ALL THOSE

00:42:40.557 --> 00:42:41.258
THINGS THAT THEY DID BEFORE

00:42:41.325 --> 00:42:43.394
AIRBNB CAN STILL HAPPEN AND ARE

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:44.995
NOT REGULATED AND ANYWAY BY THIS

00:42:45.062 --> 00:42:45.796
BILL.

00:42:45.863 --> 00:42:46.931
THIS BILL ONLY REGULATES THE

00:42:46.997 --> 00:42:48.499
PROP PLATFORMS THE NUMBER OF

00:42:48.565 --> 00:42:50.534
DAYS THAT A UNIT CAN BE RENTED

00:42:50.601 --> 00:42:53.103
OVER THE PLATFORM IN THE COASTAL

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:54.371
ZONE IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY BECAUSE

00:42:54.438 --> 00:42:56.140
WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS AND

00:42:56.206 --> 00:42:58.342
THESE UNITS -- THE SHORT TERM

00:42:58.409 --> 00:42:59.610
VACATION RENTAL PLATFORMS ARE

00:42:59.677 --> 00:43:01.779
AMPLIFYING OF THE REMOVAL OF

00:43:01.845 --> 00:43:03.981
SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS FROM --

00:43:04.048 --> 00:43:05.816
OUR HOUSING MARKET AND I WOULD

00:43:05.883 --> 00:43:07.217
LIKE TO ALSO NOTE THE SAN DIEGO

00:43:07.284 --> 00:43:08.686
COUNTY AND IS THIS THE PILOT

00:43:08.752 --> 00:43:10.220
UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SAN

00:43:10.287 --> 00:43:13.958
DIEGO COUNTY HAS ABOUT ONE PER.

00:43:14.024 --> 00:43:15.159
ONE THOUSAND A LOW COST IN OUR

00:43:15.225 --> 00:43:16.327
LOW COST ACCOMMODATION RIGHT ARE

00:43:16.393 --> 00:43:17.828
NOT LOW COST COMPETITION

00:43:17.895 --> 00:43:19.029
ACCOMMODATION RATE AND THAT'S IN

00:43:19.096 --> 00:43:19.697
THE BECAUSE THE COMMISSION'S OWN

00:43:19.763 --> 00:43:20.431
REPORT.

00:43:20.497 --> 00:43:21.598
SO WE'RE ALREADY DOING A GOOD

00:43:21.665 --> 00:43:23.167
JOB OF PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE

00:43:23.233 --> 00:43:24.802
COAST AND AGAIN I LIKE TO

00:43:24.868 --> 00:43:26.036
REITERATE THAT THIS BILL

00:43:26.103 --> 00:43:27.838
ABSOLUTELY ALLOWS FOR THE

00:43:27.905 --> 00:43:29.473
OCCASIONAL HOME SHARE THE PERSON

00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:35.279
WHO'S ON SITE TO PROVIDE ACCESS

00:43:35.346 --> 00:43:37.181
TO THE COAST.

00:43:37.247 --> 00:43:38.515
I GUESS WELL WELL TWO THINGS.

00:43:38.582 --> 00:43:40.684
THE LEGISLATURE HAS THAT CLEAN

00:43:40.751 --> 00:43:41.285
MADE ITS INTENTION IT'S CLEAR

00:43:41.352 --> 00:43:42.252
THAT WE NEED TO BE ADDRESSING

00:43:42.319 --> 00:43:43.387
THE HOUSING SHORTAGE. FOR THE

00:43:43.454 --> 00:43:44.922
LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WE'VE ALSO

00:43:44.989 --> 00:43:46.323
BEEN TALKING ABOUT ACCESS TO THE

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:48.359
COAST FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR

00:43:48.425 --> 00:43:49.226
INLAND COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES

00:43:49.293 --> 00:43:50.661
LIKE MINE.

00:43:50.728 --> 00:43:52.296
AND A LODGING BEING ONE OF THE

00:43:52.363 --> 00:43:53.564
ONE OF THE BEARS THAT WE TRY TO

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:54.631
TALK ABOUT HER AND THE

00:43:54.698 --> 00:43:55.199
LEGISLATURE'S I THINK BOTH

00:43:55.265 --> 00:43:56.066
ISSUES.

00:43:56.133 --> 00:43:57.401
HAVE HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO

00:43:57.468 --> 00:43:59.970
BE DISCUSSES THE PRIORITY BY THE

00:44:00.037 --> 00:44:00.771
LEGISLATURE.

00:44:00.838 --> 00:44:01.772
AND WHAT I'M HAVING A HARD TIME

00:44:01.839 --> 00:44:03.374
THIS.

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:04.808
UNDERSTANDING WHERE THE HOW THIS

00:44:04.875 --> 00:44:06.343
BALANCE IS STILL FOR TWO PIECES

00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:07.945
AND THE PART OF MY QUESTION IS

00:44:08.012 --> 00:44:08.779
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

00:44:08.846 --> 00:44:10.748
CURRENTLY A LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN

00:44:10.814 --> 00:44:12.349
GO TO THE CLOSE THE COMMISSION.

00:44:12.416 --> 00:44:14.585
TO TRY TO PASS REGULATIONS

00:44:14.651 --> 00:44:16.653
DEALING WITH OUR VACATION

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:18.088
RENTALS.

00:44:18.155 --> 00:44:19.723
WHY IS THAT NOT SUFFICIENT IS MY

00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:20.991
QUESTION SO THE BECAUSE THE

00:44:21.058 --> 00:44:22.659
COMMISSION I THINK IT WAS A DONE

00:44:22.726 --> 00:44:23.961
BY THE COMMITTEE NOW SAYS VERY

00:44:24.028 --> 00:44:25.195
ASTUTELY -- THE BECAUSE

00:44:25.262 --> 00:44:26.363
COMMISSION ONLY AS PER VIEW OVER

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:28.465
ACCESS TO THE COAST THEY DO NOT

00:44:28.532 --> 00:44:30.467
HAVE PER VIEW OVER BALANCING.

00:44:30.534 --> 00:44:33.103
THE IMPACT ON RENTAL PRICES FOR

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:35.372
EXAMPLE -- FOR THOSE WHO LIVE

00:44:35.439 --> 00:44:37.608
THERE SO A SHORT TERM VACATION

00:44:37.674 --> 00:44:38.709
RENTAL ORDINANCE THAT WOULD NOT

00:44:38.776 --> 00:44:39.977
BE REVIEWED UNDER THE COSTA

00:44:40.044 --> 00:44:42.079
COMMISSIONS PER VIEW OF WHAT IS

00:44:42.146 --> 00:44:43.313
THE FACT ON HOUSING

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:44.882
AFFORDABILITY FROM THAT --

00:44:44.948 --> 00:44:46.183
ORDNANCE.

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:47.818
AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS

00:44:47.885 --> 00:44:49.787
OF ALLOWING BECAUSE THE

00:44:49.853 --> 00:44:51.655
COMMISSION TO STILL HAVE THEIR

00:44:51.722 --> 00:44:53.257
RIGHT -- OVER AND EVALUATING THE

00:44:53.323 --> 00:44:54.324
SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL

00:44:54.391 --> 00:44:56.160
ORDINANCES AND MAKING SURE

00:44:56.226 --> 00:44:57.327
THEY'RE ENSURING ACCESS TO THE

00:44:57.394 --> 00:44:58.829
COAST WHICH THEY DO IN EVERY

00:44:58.896 --> 00:44:59.930
SINGLE ORDINANCE IN.

00:44:59.997 --> 00:45:02.266
SAN DIEGO COUNTY -- AND THEN

00:45:02.332 --> 00:45:03.200
CAPPING WHAT'S THIS

00:45:03.267 --> 00:45:04.701
AMPLIFICATION BECAUSE AS I

00:45:04.768 --> 00:45:06.970
SHARED BEFORE YOU GOT HERE

00:45:07.037 --> 00:45:08.672
ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- YOU KNOW AN

00:45:08.739 --> 00:45:10.574
ID WE HAVE A CASE OF TWO HUNDRED

00:45:10.641 --> 00:45:11.241
UNITS.

00:45:11.308 --> 00:45:13.110
IT JUST WHAT IT JUST GOT

00:45:13.177 --> 00:45:14.778
COMPLETED AND AN EIGHT OF THEM

00:45:14.845 --> 00:45:16.113
ARE ALREADY FULL TIME SHORT TERM

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:17.314
VACATION RENTALS.

00:45:17.381 --> 00:45:20.784
THAT CITY AB DOES NOT HAVE A

00:45:20.851 --> 00:45:21.585
SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL

00:45:21.652 --> 00:45:23.187
CRISIS THAT CITY HAS A HOUSING

00:45:23.253 --> 00:45:24.321
CRISIS.

00:45:24.388 --> 00:45:25.589
AND THIS IS THE STRAW STRUGGLE

00:45:25.656 --> 00:45:28.826
THAT WE ALL HAVE AND SO -- I I

00:45:28.892 --> 00:45:30.027
TAKE THE CITY OF CROSS BUT THE

00:45:30.094 --> 00:45:31.095
CITY OF CARLSBAD THEY WOULD HAVE

00:45:31.161 --> 00:45:32.696
BANNED THE SHORT TERM VACATION

00:45:32.763 --> 00:45:34.264
RENTALS ENTIRELY ON THEIR CITY.

00:45:34.331 --> 00:45:35.199
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A GROWTH

00:45:35.265 --> 00:45:36.767
MANAGEMENT PLAN AND THEY ARE ON

00:45:36.834 --> 00:45:38.335
TRACK FOR MAKING SURE THEY REACH

00:45:38.402 --> 00:45:39.069
THEIR HOUSING AFFORDABILITY

00:45:39.136 --> 00:45:39.937
GOALS.

00:45:40.003 --> 00:45:41.305
AND THEY WERE REQUIRED TO PUT IT

00:45:41.371 --> 00:45:43.474
IN THERE -- WHICH IS NOT BAD WE

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:45.175
WANT TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE COAST --

00:45:45.242 --> 00:45:46.810
BUT THIS IS AMPLIFYING IT TO THE

00:45:46.877 --> 00:45:48.712
POINT WHERE DEVELOPERS ARE GOING

00:45:48.779 --> 00:45:50.647
IN AND LOOKING TO LOOK USE OUR

00:45:50.714 --> 00:45:53.150
STATE WIDE STREAMLINING MEASURES

00:45:53.217 --> 00:45:55.219
THAT WE'RE PASSING. TO BUILD A

00:45:55.285 --> 00:45:56.887
HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND

00:45:56.954 --> 00:45:58.388
TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT

00:45:58.455 --> 00:46:00.190
ZONES AND CONVERTING THEM TO

00:46:00.257 --> 00:46:01.291
FULL TIME SHORT TERM VACATION

00:46:01.358 --> 00:46:02.126
RENTALS BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY

00:46:02.192 --> 00:46:03.527
CAN MAKE MORE MONEY WITH.

00:46:03.594 --> 00:46:05.929
THIS IS THE REALITY REALITY SO

00:46:05.996 --> 00:46:06.997
IF WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS WE

00:46:07.064 --> 00:46:08.265
DEAL WITH THAT WE STOP THE

00:46:08.332 --> 00:46:09.433
BLEEDING FIRST.

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:11.802
AND THEN WE GO AHEAD AND AND

00:46:11.869 --> 00:46:13.303
ADDRESS A YOU KNOW HOW WE STILL

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:14.838
HAVE TO BUILD MORE HOUSING

00:46:14.905 --> 00:46:16.140
CLEARLY YOU KNOW.

00:46:16.206 --> 00:46:22.846
AND I WOULD ST WITH YOUR EXAMPLE --

00:46:22.913 --> 00:46:23.881
75% OF THOSE UNITS FOR FOR

00:46:23.947 --> 00:46:24.982
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND TWENTY

00:46:25.048 --> 00:46:25.716
FIVE WERE SET ASIDE FOR THE

00:46:25.782 --> 00:46:27.217
CERTIFICATION IT'S THE IDEA THAT

00:46:27.284 --> 00:46:30.254
WE WE MULTI TASK HERE WE HAVE.

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:32.055
TO YOU KNOW TALK ABOUT COMPETING

00:46:32.122 --> 00:46:33.724
INTERESTS AT TIMES OUT THERE --

00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:38.162
AND I I DON'T KNOW.

00:46:38.228 --> 00:46:41.031
THE THEY'RE THEY'RE BOTH EQUALLY

00:46:41.098 --> 00:46:42.833
IMPORTANT -- I KNOW THAT AIRBNB

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:45.736
IS SOMETHING THAT I USE -- IT'S

00:46:45.802 --> 00:46:47.404
SOMETHING THAT MAKE CONSTITUENTS

00:46:47.471 --> 00:46:48.505
ON THE RARE OCCASION THAT THEY

00:46:48.572 --> 00:46:49.940
CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN THIS EVEN

00:46:50.007 --> 00:46:50.841
THEN THEY CAN'T MAKE IT HAPPEN

00:46:50.908 --> 00:46:51.608
VERY OFTEN.

00:46:51.675 --> 00:46:52.910
SOMETHING THAT THAT THAT THEY

00:46:52.976 --> 00:46:55.746
USE OUT THERE AND SO AXIS IS

00:46:55.812 --> 00:46:57.514
EQUALLY IMPORTANT WHEN I'M WE'RE

00:46:57.581 --> 00:46:58.615
SITTING HERE WAITING ON

00:46:58.682 --> 00:46:59.750
LEGISLATION REMIXES JUST LIKE

00:46:59.816 --> 00:47:00.784
WHY DO YOU CARE ABOUT CLIMATE

00:47:00.851 --> 00:47:02.419
CHANGE READY CARE ABOUT WHAT'S

00:47:02.486 --> 00:47:04.721
HAPPENING AT THE COAST NONE OF

00:47:04.788 --> 00:47:05.255
THAT AFFECTS ME AND IT AND

00:47:05.322 --> 00:47:06.256
THEY'RE NOT CONNECTED. TO IT AND

00:47:06.323 --> 00:47:06.890
THAT'S PART OF THAT ACCESS SO

00:47:06.957 --> 00:47:07.891
THAT.

00:47:07.958 --> 00:47:08.592
I COULD EASILY TO THEM THE

00:47:08.659 --> 00:47:10.093
BIGGER ECOSYSTEM AND HOW IT IS

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:11.461
CONNECTED THE SOMETIMES THE ONLY

00:47:11.528 --> 00:47:13.063
WAY TO DO IT IF I TAKING THEM OR

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:14.398
HAVING THEM HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE

00:47:14.464 --> 00:47:17.301

00:47:21.171 --> 00:47:22.105
TWENTY FIVE OF THOSE UNITS WERE

00:47:22.172 --> 00:47:23.607
NOT SET ASIDE FOR SHORT TERM

00:47:23.674 --> 00:47:25.309
VACATION RENTAL THAT WAS

00:47:25.375 --> 00:47:27.978
SUPPOSED TO BE -- TWO HUNDRED

00:47:28.045 --> 00:47:30.047

THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO NEED TO

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:38.055
HAVE A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD.

00:47:38.121 --> 00:47:40.257
IN SOUTH SAN DIEGO COUNTY THEY

00:47:40.324 --> 00:47:41.992
DON'T HAVE ONE AND THE OTHER

00:47:42.059 --> 00:47:43.493
THING IS I JUST WANT TO POINT

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:45.862

AVERAGE OF NINETY FIVE NIGHT

BELIEVE PER ROOM AND THAT'S

00:47:52.369 --> 00:47:52.903
TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A NIGHT

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:54.371

WE ALL YOU KNOW BUNDLE UP AND

00:48:00.444 --> 00:48:02.312
FOR PEOPLE IN ONE HOTEL ROOM FOR

00:48:02.379 --> 00:48:02.913
EIGHTY NINE AT NIGHT.

00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:05.082
SO JUST -- TO GIVE SOME -- YOU

00:48:05.148 --> 00:48:11.855
KNOW CONTACTS FOR OTHER PRICING

00:48:11.922 --> 00:48:13.590
IN IN THE DISTRICT [inaudible]

00:48:13.657 --> 00:48:15.792
MR FLORA.

00:48:15.859 --> 00:48:16.660
SAYED DON'T REALLY KNOW SO I

00:48:16.727 --> 00:48:17.828
HAVE A QUESTION BUT I CERTAINLY

00:48:17.894 --> 00:48:19.062
ECHO SO LITERACY IS COMMENTS --

00:48:19.129 --> 00:48:19.663
THERE ARE SOME GREAT CONCERNS

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:21.198
ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE OF US TO

00:48:21.265 --> 00:48:22.065
LIVE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY.

00:48:22.132 --> 00:48:22.666
YOU KNOW IT TO ME THIS SOUNDS

00:48:22.733 --> 00:48:23.300
LIKE A VERY MUCH A SUPPLY DEMAND

00:48:23.367 --> 00:48:23.867
ISSUE.

00:48:23.934 --> 00:48:24.868
THAT IF THERE IS A DEMAND EVEN

00:48:24.935 --> 00:48:26.036
IF THERE ARE INVESTORS THAT ARE

00:48:26.103 --> 00:48:27.471
INVESTING IN THESE HOMES CLEARLY

00:48:27.537 --> 00:48:29.072
THERE IS A DEMAND.

00:48:29.139 --> 00:48:30.674
AND SO IF THERE IS PEOPLE THAT

00:48:30.741 --> 00:48:32.342
ARE WANTING TO GO TO THE COAST

00:48:32.409 --> 00:48:33.877
THERE NEEDING PLACES TO STAY.

00:48:33.944 --> 00:48:35.112
WE SHOULD PROVIDE THEM THE

00:48:35.178 --> 00:48:36.313
OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO.

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:38.715
SO IF WE CUT THE AVAILABLE ROOMS

00:48:38.782 --> 00:48:40.183
WHATEVER THEY MAY BE.

00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:42.052
OBVIOUSLY THE PRICE IS GOING UP

00:48:42.119 --> 00:48:42.953
THEY'RE GONNA CHARGE MORE FOR

00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:44.955
THAT SO WE CREATE THIS ACCESS

00:48:45.022 --> 00:48:47.291
ISSUE AND IF YOU DO GET LUCKY

00:48:47.357 --> 00:48:48.525
AND BE ABLE TO GET SOMEBODY.

00:48:48.592 --> 00:48:49.726
YOU HAVE AG PRICING PROBLEM

00:48:49.793 --> 00:48:50.961
WHERE A LOT OF MY CONSTITUENTS

00:48:51.028 --> 00:48:52.596
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD THAT.

00:48:52.663 --> 00:48:54.364
SO THIS THING TO ME -- I DON'T

00:48:54.431 --> 00:48:55.499
LIKE THE FACT THAT WE'RE TELLING

00:48:55.565 --> 00:48:56.266
PEOPLE WHAT TO DO WITH THE

00:48:56.333 --> 00:48:57.134
PRIVATE PROPERTY I DON'T

00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:58.769
PARTICULARLY LOVE THAT.

00:48:58.835 --> 00:48:59.770

OKAY WE DON'T LIVE ON THE COAST

00:49:04.074 --> 00:49:05.542
WERE FARM COUNTRY WE LIKE TO

I I AM PRIMARILY BY THE COAST I

00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.976
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE TALK

00:49:40.043 --> 00:49:41.478
ABOUT RATES TO FACTOR IN THE THE

00:49:41.545 --> 00:49:43.080
WHOLE EQUATION WHEN YOU SAID A

YOU PAY A HOTEL RESORT FEE --

FOR YOUR NIGHTLY RATE -- YES

00:49:52.956 --> 00:49:54.191
RATES ARE SUBSTANTIALLY CHEAPER

00:49:54.257 --> 00:49:55.792
WHEN YOU DIVIDE THEM BY ROOM IF

00:49:55.859 --> 00:49:57.160
YOU'RE FOR EXAMPLE LOOKING AT A

00:49:57.227 --> 00:49:58.128
TWO BEDROOM CONDO IN MISSION

00:49:58.195 --> 00:50:00.297
BEACH AS OPPOSED TO TRYING TO

00:50:00.364 --> 00:50:02.399
GET IF YOU CAN EVEN FIND -- ONE

00:50:02.466 --> 00:50:05.202
TO HOTEL ROOMS AT A LOCAL HOTEL

00:50:05.268 --> 00:50:06.236
THERE IS NO COMPARISON BUT

00:50:06.303 --> 00:50:10.140
FACTORED INTO THAT THAT WHEN YOU

00:50:10.207 --> 00:50:10.741
HAVE A KITCHEN.

00:50:10.807 --> 00:50:11.808
THAT YOU CAN THEN COOK YOUR OWN

00:50:11.875 --> 00:50:12.976
MEALS -- WHICH FOR A LOT OF OUR

00:50:13.043 --> 00:50:14.344
GUESTS ARE STAYING WITH FAMILIES

00:50:14.411 --> 00:50:16.480
IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT -- YOU

00:50:16.546 --> 00:50:18.248
KNOW THE THE THAT IS THE NUMBER

00:50:18.315 --> 00:50:19.316
ONE AND NUMBER TWO REASON WE

00:50:19.383 --> 00:50:21.251
HEAR FROM OUR GAS WHY THEY WANT.

00:50:21.318 --> 00:50:22.386
TO STAY IN A SHORT TERM VACATION

00:50:22.452 --> 00:50:23.520
RENTAL AS OPPOSED TO A HOTEL

00:50:23.587 --> 00:50:24.921
BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE KIDS --

00:50:24.988 --> 00:50:26.590
YOU WOULD MUCH PREFER TO COOK

00:50:26.656 --> 00:50:27.124
YOUR OWN MEALS YOU SAVE A

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:28.792
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY AND

00:50:28.859 --> 00:50:30.794
IT IS MUCH CHEAPER AND TACKLE

00:50:30.861 --> 00:50:31.695
YOUR POINTS ARE FROM GOING TOO

WE HAVE PEOPLE HERE FROM THE

00:50:40.737 --> 00:50:41.438
HOTEL INDUSTRY I WOULD BE

00:50:41.505 --> 00:50:42.606
CURIOUS TO SEE.

00:50:42.672 --> 00:50:44.574
WHAT THEY'RE VACANCY RATES ARE

00:50:44.641 --> 00:50:46.476

00:50:52.182 --> 00:50:52.749
POINT.

00:50:52.816 --> 00:50:54.584
IF YOU LIMIT THE AVAILABILITY OF

00:50:54.651 --> 00:50:56.052
SHORT TERM RENTALS DRASTICALLY

00:50:56.119 --> 00:50:57.287
WHICH THIS WOULD BY MY

00:50:57.354 --> 00:51:00.657
CALCULATIONS BY 9295% OF COURSE

00:51:00.724 --> 00:51:02.259

THEN RATES GO UP SO IT IS NO

00:51:08.331 --> 00:51:09.499
SURPRISE THAT THOSE THAT ARE.

00:51:09.566 --> 00:51:12.736
FOCUSED ON SUPPORTING THIS BILL

00:51:12.803 --> 00:51:13.303
ARE PRIMARILY FROM THE HOTEL

00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:14.438
INDUSTRY.

00:51:14.504 --> 00:51:16.306

00:51:16.373 --> 00:51:18.074
THIS BILL MYSELF BECAUSE THIS IS

00:51:18.141 --> 00:51:20.844
A CRISIS IN MY COMMUNITY THIS IS

00:51:20.911 --> 00:51:22.012

WE TRY TO CARVE OUT.

00:55:27.691 --> 00:55:28.792
SINGLE COUNTIES BECAUSE THE

00:55:28.858 --> 00:55:29.926
COUNTIES HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO

00:55:29.993 --> 00:55:31.327
THIS THEMSELVES IF THEY DIDN'T

00:55:31.394 --> 00:55:33.129
WANT TO DO IT.

00:55:33.196 --> 00:55:35.198
SO IF THOSE SUPERVISORS DON'T

00:55:35.265 --> 00:55:37.300
WANT AIRBNB THEN THEY CAN STEP

00:55:37.367 --> 00:55:38.134
UP AND DO THEIR OWN COUNTY

00:55:38.201 --> 00:55:39.836
ORDINANCE. TO LOCK THE AIRBNB

00:55:39.903 --> 00:55:41.604
EASE THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO

00:55:41.671 --> 00:55:42.872
THESE THINGS.

00:55:42.939 --> 00:55:45.442
SO IT IT IS.

00:55:45.508 --> 00:55:46.543
I I DON'T THINK THE BILL'S PUT

00:55:46.609 --> 00:55:48.078
TOGETHER RIGHT I THINK YOU'RE

00:55:48.144 --> 00:55:51.147
TRYING -- TO OVERREACH AND I'M

00:55:51.214 --> 00:55:53.183
NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THIS.

00:56:08.498 --> 00:56:09.132

ORDINANCE TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS

00:56:13.436 --> 00:56:15.839
THAT ISSUE OF OF HOUSING STOCK

00:56:15.905 --> 00:56:16.840
VERSES.

00:56:18.942 --> 00:56:19.509

IT PROVIDE YOU KNOW A LOT OF

00:56:32.889 --> 00:56:34.624
HOTELS ARE EXPENSIVE.

AS I SHARED WITH YOU I

00:56:37.093 --> 00:56:37.927
APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

00:56:56.913 --> 00:56:57.881
CONTROVERSY ALL.

00:56:57.947 --> 00:56:59.349

00:57:01.651 --> 00:57:02.852
IN YOUR COMMUNITY.

00:57:02.919 --> 00:57:05.221
AND I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY AND I

00:57:05.288 --> 00:57:06.356
YOU KNOW I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE

00:57:06.422 --> 00:57:07.824
JUST THAT YOU WERE WILLING AS A

00:57:07.891 --> 00:57:09.325
FRESHMAN TO JUMP IN AND AND TAKE

00:57:09.392 --> 00:57:11.427

YOU GET THE VOTES SO.

00:57:12.128 --> 00:57:14.364
IF YOU KNOW GOOD FOR YOU -- AND

00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:15.665
THERE IS A REAL PROBLEM WITH

00:57:15.732 --> 00:57:19.102
AFFORDABILITY AND WITH LOSING --

00:57:19.169 --> 00:57:20.970
OF LONG TERM YOU KNOW NORMAL

00:57:21.037 --> 00:57:22.572
STABILIZE DEPARTMENTS IN YOUR

00:57:22.639 --> 00:57:24.574
COMMUNITY -- AND YOU KNOW ALSO

00:57:24.641 --> 00:57:25.675
FINDING THAT BALANCE WITH THE

00:57:25.742 --> 00:57:27.443
COASTAL ACCESS AND MAKING SURE

00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:27.911
THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF

00:57:27.977 --> 00:57:31.247
OPPORTUNITIES. FOR PEOPLE -- TO

00:57:31.314 --> 00:57:32.248
FIND ACCOMMODATIONS FOR SHORT

00:57:32.315 --> 00:57:33.616
TERM VACATION RENTALS AND FOR

00:57:33.683 --> 00:57:35.885
OVERNIGHT STAYS AND BALANCING

00:57:35.952 --> 00:57:39.989
THAT IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT -- I

00:57:40.056 --> 00:57:40.623
YOU KNOW I'M CONCERT I I DO HAVE

00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:41.291
SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL I'M

00:57:41.357 --> 00:57:42.826
CONCERNED ABOUT SORT OF THE

00:57:42.892 --> 00:57:44.327
FAVORITISM THAT IT'S SORT OF

00:57:44.394 --> 00:57:45.595
SHOWING SOME PLATFORMS OVER

00:57:45.662 --> 00:57:47.430
OTHERS AND I UNDERSTAND THAT

00:57:47.497 --> 00:57:48.031
THERE ARE PLATFORMS THAT ARE

00:57:48.097 --> 00:57:48.998
USED MORE.

00:57:49.065 --> 00:57:50.400
MAY BE SEEN AS BEING MORE

00:57:50.466 --> 00:57:52.635
DISRUPTIVE -- BUT KIND OF A

00:57:52.702 --> 00:57:53.970
FOCUSING ON THE SHORT TERM

00:57:54.037 --> 00:57:55.738
VACATION RENTALS BUT LEAVING

00:57:55.805 --> 00:57:57.640
CRAIG'S LIST LEAVING IT UP TO

00:57:57.707 --> 00:57:59.709
PEOPLE TO RUN THEIR OWN WEBSITES --

00:57:59.776 --> 00:58:01.311
IS A BIT OF A CONCERN FOR ME

00:58:01.377 --> 00:58:02.779
GIVEN THAT CRISIS HAS NO

00:58:02.846 --> 00:58:03.947
PROTECTIONS THAT OFFER THE USERS

00:58:04.013 --> 00:58:05.648
WERE AS THE OTHER PLATFORMS DO

00:58:05.715 --> 00:58:06.416
HAVE.

00:58:06.482 --> 00:58:08.451
PROTECTIONS THEY ALSO DO WORK

00:58:08.518 --> 00:58:09.419
BETTER WITH THE CITIES IN TERMS

00:58:09.485 --> 00:58:11.521
OF COLLECTING TO TEAMWORK

00:58:11.588 --> 00:58:12.255
CRAIG'S.

00:58:12.322 --> 00:58:14.023
AND OTHER SITES DON'T DO THAT AT

00:58:14.090 --> 00:58:16.025
ALL SO YOU KNOW TO ME THAT'S

00:58:16.092 --> 00:58:17.727
THAT'S A BIT OF AN ISSUE I ALSO

00:58:17.794 --> 00:58:19.095
THOUGHT THAT YOU KNOW GIVEN THE

00:58:19.162 --> 00:58:20.597
COASTAL COMMISSION LIMITED

00:58:20.663 --> 00:58:22.799
AUTHORITY. TO PROMOTE AFFORDABLE

00:58:22.866 --> 00:58:24.868
VISITOR ACCOMMODATIONS AGAINST

00:58:24.934 --> 00:58:26.102
PRESERVING AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:58:26.169 --> 00:58:27.237
WAS MAYBE SEVEN THE COASTAL

00:58:27.303 --> 00:58:29.205
COMMISSION ITSELF COULD JUST BE

00:58:29.272 --> 00:58:31.040
ASSIGNED TO TO TRY TO FIND A WAY

00:58:31.107 --> 00:58:32.342
OF FINDING THAT BALANCE RATHER

00:58:32.408 --> 00:58:33.877
RATHER THAN DOING THIS BILL.

00:58:33.943 --> 00:58:35.778
HOWEVER WHAT I APPRECIATE IS

00:58:35.845 --> 00:58:36.579
THAT YOU'RE DOING THIS AS A

00:58:36.646 --> 00:58:39.048
PILOT IN A SMALL AREA WITH THE

00:58:39.115 --> 00:58:40.283
STUDY AT THE END SO THAT WE CAN.

00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:42.285
EVALUATE THIS SO THAT AS WE LOOK

00:58:42.352 --> 00:58:43.887
AT OTHER AREAS THAT IN HIGH

00:58:43.953 --> 00:58:45.455
DEMAND WHETHER IT'S THIS YEAR IS

00:58:45.521 --> 00:58:48.024
OR TAHOE OR OTHER COASTAL AREAS

00:58:48.091 --> 00:58:49.225
OR AT LEAST WILL BE DATA AND

00:58:49.292 --> 00:58:50.860
KIND OF AN EXPERIMENT ABOUT

00:58:50.927 --> 00:58:52.095
WHETHER OR NOT THIS.

00:58:52.161 --> 00:58:53.730
WORKS AT ALL IT IS ABLE TO FIND

00:58:53.796 --> 00:58:55.732
THAT BALANCE SO I I CAN SUPPORT

00:58:55.798 --> 00:58:57.634
THE BILL TODAY -- BUT AGAIN I

00:58:57.700 --> 00:58:59.302
KNOW IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S

00:59:00.904 --> 00:59:02.405
THAT I WOULD INVITE YOU TO MAKE

00:59:02.472 --> 00:59:03.273

RIGHT TO REGULATE OR BAN ON

SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS AS
