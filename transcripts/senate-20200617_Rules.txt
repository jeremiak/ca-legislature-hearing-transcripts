I WAS MOST RECENTLY DEPUTY COMMISSIONER AT THE NEW YORK CITY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH.

I WAS ALSO SENIOR ADVISER AT THE GLOBE FOR GLOBAL HEALTH AT THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL PREVENT AND PREVENTION IN ATLANTA. ESPECIALLY DURING THIS PANDEMIC THAT EXPERIENCE OF THOSE RELATIONSHIPS HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY USEFUL IN WORKING WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- THANK YOU DOCTOR ANGEL I WANT TO START BY CONGRATULATING YOU ON YOUR APPOINTMENT AND- THANK YOU FOR THE TIME YOU FORGET ME YESTERDAY WE HAD A GOOD CONVERSATION. AND I KNOW HOW BUSY BEEN ARM SINCE TAKING THE HELM LARA WITH DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IN WE APPRECIATE THE- LONG HOURS THE YUNIOR STAFF HAVE SERVED- I WANT TO GO OVER SOME STARTING WITH THE WE TALKED EXTENSIVELY ABOUT THE COVERT NINETEEN RESPONSE. AND I WANT TO FOCUS IN. SECURELY WE DISCUSSED SOME PROVISION OF- PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT TO BOTH HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTH WORKERS CAN YOU PROVIDE US A STATUS REPORT. ON THE STATE'S ROLE PARTICULARLY WITH PRIVATE SECTOR HOSPITALS AND- OTHER COMMUNITY CLINICS HOSPITALS WHAT IS THE- ROLE IN WHAT'S YOUR CURRENT ASSESSMENT OF THE AVAILABILITY OF PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. YEAH SO- IT ONE OF THE KEY FOCUSES OF OUR WORK HAS BEEN TO ENSURE THAT OUR CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IS STRONG AND THAT IT'S PREPARED TO RECEIVE IF NECESSARY PATIENTS IN OUR COMMUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES AND SAVE LIVES- PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT HAS BEEN AS WE ALL KNOW- ONE OF THE MAJOR AREAS WHERE WE HAVE FOCUSED A LOT OF OUR WORK THAT IS BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN. A GLOBAL SHORTAGE NATIONAL AND READ SHORTAGES WERE SO HAVE BEEN THERE PRO. ABOUT IDENTIFYING SOURCES INCLUDING CONTRACTS IN PLACE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE PPO THEY'LL BE AVAILABLE FOR OUR CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM- FIRST AND FOREMOST BUT ALSO- WITH INTENTIONS OF MAKING IT MORE BROADLY AVAILABLE AS THE MARKET PLACE OPENS UP- UP WE ARE. WE THROUGH THIS PROCESS- WE- REMIND OF P. P. TO PRIVATE HIGH. AND PRIVATE AS AS WELL AS OTHERS THEY'RE ALL PART OF THIS CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT PROTECTS ALL OF CALIFORNIA. SO AS WE RECEIVED- SUPPLIES. WE% RESPOND TO REQUESTS THAT WE HAVE FROM CLINICS AND HOSPITALS ACROSS THE STATE THERE IS A SYSTEM THAT SET UP THAT ALLOWS FOR REQUEST TO BE MADE- THROUGH A REGIONAL- CONTACTS UP TO THE STATE. AND WHEN WE RECEIVE THE THOSE REQUESTS WE FILL THEM ACCORDING. TO NEED AN AVAILABILITY- CURRENTLY WE HAVE AND NINETY FIVES- THAT OUR NATIONAL PROVED AND THEY ARE COMING IN- WE CONTINUED TO- THEY THEY CONTINUE TO BE OUR- LIMITED BUT ARE. AVAILABLE GALLONS OF THE OTHER ONES THAT HAVE BEEN A CHALLENGING IT FROM GLOBAL SHORTAGES. BUT WE ALSO HAVE THOSE IN WE ARE MOVING THE MOUSE. AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE- AND THOSE SUPPLIES ALSO ARE. AVAILABLE I'M GOING IT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT I IS THERE TO PROTECT OUR CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND RELATED TO HAT I DID REYES WITH YOU YESTERDAY. CONCERNS RAISED BY CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION ABOUT SOME NURSES. BEING REQUIRED TO ENTER FROM. CONTAMINATED AREAS OR WORK AREAS WHO HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED WITH ADEQUATE. PP I KNOW I JUST RAISE THAT WITH YOU YESTERDAY BUT. WOULD LIKE TO HEAR. PART MEANT THREE BE AND MAKE IT TO HIM. THE LEGAL ROUTE TO PUT EMPLOYEE AND NOT TO PUT IN SKINNER AND OTHERS AT RISK BY PUTTING THEM IN A WORKPLACE WITHOUT ADEQUATE. PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. YES CENTER MAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE CALL THAT WE HAD YESTERDAY AND FOR YOU SCHERING- THAT INFORMATION WITH US WE ARE LOOKING INTO THAT ON INDEED THERE IS GUIDANCE- ONLINE FOR A CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM REGARDING- PP E. AND ITS USE AND SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK INTO THAT AND GET BACK TO YOU. WITH FURTHER DETAILS ON THAT IN RELATED TO THAT THANK YOU I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION RELATED TO. NURSES AND OTHER HEALTH CARE WORKERS WHO HAVE TESTED POSITIVE FOR COVERT NINETEEN- WHO OF DIED SOME WHO'VE DIED FROM THE DISEASE. BUT THERE'S NO DETAIL ON WHERE THESE HEALTH CARE WORKERS WORKED MORE THAN HOSPITALS SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES OR OTHER FACILITIES. AND OTHER THAN BEING CLASSIFIED AS HEALTH CARE WORKER WAS THAT A DOCTOR AND NURSE A RESPIRATORY THERAPIST. IS IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO GET. THAT MORE DETAILED. INFORMATION WHILE PROTECTING OBVIOUSLY PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY BUT IT WOULD SEEM JUST THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF WHO IS BEING EXPOSED AND- IN THOSE SAID CASES WHERE SOMEBODY HAS DIED. FOR US TO KNOW IF IT WAS A DOCTOR AND NURSE OR RESPIRATORY TH RESPIRATORY THERAPISTS TO SEND INFORMATION THAT YOU CAN GET FORCE. THE CENTER MONNING AYE YOU ASKED ME THAT QUESTION YESTERDAY AND I DID CHECK WE DO NOT HAVE THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER THEY WERE A DOCTOR OR NURSE IMMEDIATELY ON HAND- WE HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT IT YOU KNOW IF THEY WERE WORKING AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ARE HOSPITALS. AND THAT INFORMATION IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN- WE CAN LOOK MORE CLOSELY AT. THANKS AND THEN JUST RELATED TO THAT- SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT. TO YOUR DEPARTMENT THE NUMBER OF INFECTED HEALTHCARE WORKERS IN THEIR FACILITIES AND THE NUMBER WHO HAVE DIED HOSPITAL'S HOWEVER ARE NOT REQUIRED TO REPORT SIMILAR INFORMATION. WHY IS THERE THAT DISCREPANCY BETWEEN SKILLED NURSING FACILITY REQUIRED REPORTING AND WE'RE NOT GETTING THAT INFORMATION FROM HOSPITALS. I WILL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THE SPECIFICS OF THAT. THANK YOU AND I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT MY NUMBER SOME OF THESE ARE ISSUES THAT WERE JUST BROUGHT TO YOUR ATTENTION YESTERDAY THAT I WOULD VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. THE FOLLOW UP. SHIFTING AWAY FROM COVERT NINETEEN WE DID DISCUSS. THE CHALLENGE MAYBE PARTLY RELATED TO COVERT NINETEEN OF. FAMILIES NOT GETTING FACT CHILDREN KEEPING ON THEIR VACCINATION SCHEDULES- IN YOU SHARED WITH ME AND I THINK WOULD BE OF INTEREST TO THE COMMITTEE AND THE PUBLIC QUITE STEPS YOU'RE TAKING TO TRY TO PROTECT. OUR VACCINE PROGRAMS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IF YOU KNOW THE VACCINATIONS ARE SO IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR KIDS STAY HEALTHY AND INDEED- SINCE- COATED NINETEEN- SINCE WE HAVE DECREASED ARE. A DURING THE STAY AT HOME ORDERS IN ORDER TO CREATE A MORE ACCESS TO CARE TO PROTECT THE CARE SYSTEM WE BACKED OFF ON SOME ELECTIVE PROCEDURES AND SOME OUTPATIENT- APPOINTMENTS AS WELL- AND WE DID AN ANALYSIS IN APRIL AND WE FOUND. THAT COMPARED WITH THE LAST YEAR VACCINATIONS WERE DOWN ABOUT 40% WHICH IS INCREDIBLY CONCERNING TO US SO WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY THOUGHTFULLY THROUGH OUR CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM MECHANISMS- THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO IDENTIFY WAYS THAT WE CAN HELP AND ENCOURAGE PROVIDERS TO REACH OUT TO THOSE PATIENTS. AND MAKE SURE THAT DAY THEY'RE BROUGHT IN FOR THOSE VACCINATIONS WE THINK THAT UP PROVIDERS IN PARTICULAR ARE YOUR TRUSTED. CONTACTS OF THESE PATIENTS AND SO THEY'RE REALLY GOOD MESSENGERS AND HELPING TO COMMUNICATE AND GET UP PARENTS TO BRING THEIR KIDS AND I WANTED THE CLEAR MESSAGES THAT I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY WAS THAT YOU KNOW OUR CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IN OUR- ENVIRONMENT JUST LIKE IN MANY. DIFFERENT SECTORS IS CHANGE THE WAY THAT WE'RE DOING WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN PARENTS BRING THEIR CHILDREN AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THERE BEING HIGH RISK FOR THOSE CHILDREN BE EXPOSED. NINETEEN AS WELL SO WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE ALSO THAT THAT CASE NOT. MAKE SURE. NO THAT THE BRING THEIR CHILDREN AND THE WE NEED THEM TO BE THE TO PROTECT THEIR CHILDREN AND PROTECT THE CHILDREN AROUND THEM WELL THANK YOU AND THEN MY FINAL OCCUR THAT I THINK IT WILL EVOLVING A- WE HAD A GOOD ABOUT CHILL HEALTH ABOUT. CHRONIC DISEASE. DIE NEED. ACT SOME OF THE ON LINE GOING. DETERMINANT IN. HEALTH IN YEAR STRAW HISTORY AND AREA IN YOUR CA. TO WORKING US. IN THE LEGISLATURE. AS I SHARED WITH YOU I THINK. THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ARE. SYNONYMOUS WITH THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE LEGISLATURE WE ALL WANT A HEALTHY CALIFORNIA. IN YET. WE'VE SUFFERED SOME FRUSTRATION IN OUR EFFORTS TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OVER THE YEARS- A DEPARTMENT OF OVER. THREE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EMPLOYEES AND OVER TWO HUNDRED PROGRAMS ONE OF MY QUESTIONS WAS HOW DO YOU MANAGE SUCH A MASSIVE ORGANIZATION. BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE SHOULD SEE EACH OTHER AS ALLIES I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU IN YOUR NEW ROLE AS LEADER. TO WORK TO IMPROVE. THE RESPONSE TIME OF EMPLOYEES OF YOUR DEPARTMENT IN CORY'S FROM MEMBERS OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND I'M JUST GOING TO BE FRANK WE'VE BEEN FRUSTRATED I SHARE THIS WITH YOU YESTERDAY. OF ALL THE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES WE DEAL WITH DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS THE REPUTATION OF NOT BEING RESPONSIVE TO MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND I WOULD JUST LIKE YEAR COMMITMENT AS THE NEW DIRECTOR.

THAT'S THAT'S COME TO HEAR AND I IT FOR MY AND I KNOW ALSO FOR A STAFF AND I THINK YOU AS A- AGENCY WE HAVE LOTS OF INFORMATION AND IT'S OUR OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE A BILL TO PROVIDE IT TO REALLY- MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE INFORMATION YOU NEED TO.

THEY DEMONSTRATED IN WERE AMAZED CLASS AND PARTNERS THAT THEY CAN REACT QUICKLY TO. THAT SPACE WE CONTINUE TO. THE AMOUNT OF THE EVENTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE I SEE YOU BAD ACROSS THE STATE WE CURRENTLY NOW HAVE PROCESSES IN PLACE TO COLLECT THAT DATA REGULARLY AND TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND IF THERE'S ANY AREAS THAT WE SHOULD BE PAYING CLOSER ATTENTION TO. THE WE HAVE GREAT BUT A PROCESSES IN PLACE TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF OUR CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM GREAT PARTNERSHIPS IN PLACE AND THE RESOURCES WE NEED IN PLACE SHOULD WE NEED.

THAT THE STATE IS ASKING FOR PARTICIPATION BY HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IT IS STATEWIDE COMMITTEE TO DETERMINE WHO WOULD BE. THE FIRST PEOPLE TO RECEIVE VACCINE NOW WHEN I HEARD WHEN IT'S AVAILABLE AT THE END OF THIS YEAR I WOULD SAY IF IT'S AVAILABLE- BY FARLEY AND JOB. I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE SENT OUT TO DIRECTIVE ASKING FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN THAT COMMITTEE. AND THEY WOULD BE CONSIDERING- WHO WOULD BE OUR FIRST TO GET THE VACCINE OR I GUESS WHO WOULD BE WILLING. TO BE SOME OF THE FIRST TO GET VACCINE IS THAT ACCURATE AND JOHN THAT INFORMATION THAT'S GOING TO BE. PROVIDED WITH MORE. TO OF US WHO GET QUESTIONS CERTAIN FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS. WE ARE.

SO JUST KEEP A FILE OF UP TO THE MINUTE ON DOWN AND IF WE HAVE ANY INFORMATION THAT WILL BE HELPFUL TO YOU. A PLEASE REACH OUT BECAUSE WE ARE GETTING ALL IN MY TO COUNTY SAN DIEGO AND ORANGE WE ARE GETTING OUR WEEKLY WE ACTUALLY GOT TARA THREE TIMES A WEEK UPDATES ON. WHAT THE SITUATION LOOKED LIKE ON ALL THE FRIENDS FOR COAL VI&lt;c.cyan&gt; AND NOW IT'S USUALLY&lt;/c&gt; ONCE A WEEK AND IT'S VERY VERY WELL DONE AND I KNOW THE STATE IS DOING THAT TOO. BUT THE MORE INFORMATION WE HAVE. OUR A AND EDUCATION WE CAN PROVIDE I AM AT THE LEVEL WILL BE CRITICAL. TO ENSURE WHEN THE VACCINE IS AVAILABLE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND JOB. IT IS. BUT WHAT IS FOR.

THANK YOU MAYOR PRO TEM. CONGRATS ON YOUR POINT IN AND DAY YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. JUST LIKE THE US WE HAVE THE ROLE OF THE AND CONSENT WHEN IT COMES TO COOPER TRY UP. AND THIS COMMITTEE MAKES RECOMMENDATION AND GOES TO THE FLOOR OUR COLLEGE IN THE FLOOR DON'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK THE QUESTIONS THEY HAVE TO DO SIMPLY UP OR DOWN VOTE SO I TOOK THE TIME TO REACH OUT AND I'VE GOT A SERIES OF QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE SO I TRY TO DO IT IN ORDER TO MEET SENSE BUT SOME PEOPLE THINK WE DIDN'T DO ENOUGH SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT WE DID TO ME SO I'M JUST GOING TO PLOW THROUGH THIS. AND GET YOUR A LOT. IT SO MARCH SIXTEENTH THE VOTE TO JR GET ON PRESS UNPRECEDENTED POWER TO THE A TO GOVERNOR MANY LEGISLATOR VOTED FOR THE MEASURES PART DUE TO THE- THAT YOU PROVIDE EARLIER THAT AFTERNOON TO THE VARIOUS CAUCUSES AS I RECALL FROM THE BRIEFING YOU STATED COVER NINETEEN WAS HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS AND THAT WE SHOULD EXPECT TWENTY FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS TO BE INFECTED WE WERE TOLD AMERICA MORTALITY RATE WAS QUITE HIGH AND THAT WE WOULD NOT BE SAFE UNTIL WE REACHED HERD IMMUNITY AND OR A VACCINE WAS DISCOVERED. SO IF YOU CAN CRY THAT IF YOU WANT. THIS IS MY- BUT SO HOW DO YOU RECKON. CONSULT STATEMENTS FROM MY SIXTEEN SO WHY IT WHAT HAS HOW. YEAH I RECONCILE IT BY A KNOWLEDGE IN GIVING CREDIT TO ALL CALIFORNIANS- OUT MARCH NINETEENTH AS YOU KNOW WE ARE. YEAH I ISSUED A STAY AT HOME ORDER WHICH MEANT STATS- UNLESS PEOPLE HAD ESSENTIAL REASONS TO GO OUT OF THEIR HOME LIKE TO GO GROCERY SHOPPING OR TO PICK UP PRESCRIPTIONS THEY WERE TO STAY IN THEIR HOME UNLESS THEY WERE PART OF THIS CENTURY WORKFORCE. AND CALIFORNIA'S TOOK THAT REALLY SERIOUSLY AND WE SAW WE SAW THROUGH MOBILITY DATA PEOPLE STOP TO GOING OUT DAIS THE MOVEMENT ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SLOW DOWN AND PEOPLE DID NOT GO OUT AND I WOULD STATE HAS BEEN- SOMETHING THAT CALIFORNIANS AND ALL OF US CAN BE VERY PROUD OF BECAUSE WE DID. SB OFF DAY BEND THE WRIST THE PROJECT THAT YEAR DESCRIBE WHERE THE PER. OF THAT EXIST AND TO BECAUSE OF THIS WORK ON THE PART OF HEALTH. WE'RE LOOKING AT A VERY DIFFERENT RIGHT NOW WITH RESPECT THAT FIRST ANTICIPATED OUR- IN SPITE THAT WE- THOUGHT THAT COULD IF DIDN'T DO SOMETHING. AND IN FACT WE SEEN WHAT HAVE ENOUGH PLACES THE WORLD- I THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE TYPE OF ORDER THAT WE HAD IN PLACE EARLY AND OFTEN DIDN'T SLOW. POPULATION MOVEMENT DOWN SO THAT'S HOW I WOULD RECONCILE THE TWO I WOULD RECONCILE IT BY GIVING CREDIT TO CALIFORNIANS I WOULD REMIND US ALL THAT IT'S NOT OVER YET. I'M WE'RE IN A POSITION NOW WHERE- WE ARE CONTINUING TO WATCH THE DATA AND THINGS ARE VERY STABLE- BUT THAT IS THAT'S- WHY WHERE WE ARE NOW IS SO DIFFERENT FROM WHERE WE WERE WHEN WE HAD THAT CONVERSATION WITH YOU BACK. EARLIER IN MARCH BREAK THE. KNWING WE KNOW. IN THE CLASS DAMAGE AN FOR. INFLICTED NOT SECOND. BUT SOCIAL SO WHERE THERE'S MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES TO. A CHICKEN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CHILD ABUSE SUICIDE IN ALCOHOL AND DRUG ADDICTION. FROM THE STATE HOME ORDER. WOULD YOU RECOMMEND CLOSING THE STATE AGAIN SHOULD WE SEE AN INCREASE IN CASES. AND IF SO WHAT WOULD BE THE CRITERIA AND OR BENCHMARKS THAT YOU WOULD USE TO DETERMINE CLOSURE. SO WE HAVE PLAYED OUT INDICATORS THAT WE ARE USING AT THE STATE LEVEL TO HELP US UNDERSTAND- BOTH PREPAREDNESS OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND AND ALSO TO FOLLOW. MEN OF INFECTION. WITH A THE STATE OF. WE ARE. THAT THE PROVISIONS THAT WE IN PLACE SO FAR HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING US TO WHERE WE ARE NOW AND AS WE ARE OPENING UP OUR ECONOMY AGAIN AND AS WE CREATED THESE PROCESSES OF VARIATIONS FOR. COUNTIES ARE COUNTIES ALSO NOW HAVE ASSUME TOO MUCH MORE RESPONSIBILITY AND PREPAREDNESS IN THEIR OWN RIGHT AND OUR OUR- LEADING A LOT THOSE PROCESS SEES AND FOLLOWING IN MONITORING WHAT'S GOING ON THE COMMUNITIES AND- PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS ARE MAKING THE DECISIONS ABOUT THE SPEED THAT'S APPROPRIATE I WOULD SAY THAT WE ARE WE ARE ALL AT THE STATE LEVEL AT THAT. COUNTY LEVEL OUT BEING AT THE DATA ARE. CONSTANTLY ASSESSING WHEN WE'RE MAKE TO SAY ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR OVER UP NEW AREAS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IT IS SAFE FOR THOSE SIR. AND USE THE DATA TO US UNDERSTAND WHETHER NOT A- WOULD BE NEEDED EVERY. A CHANGE IN OUR CASE. ARE WHEN YOU STAND ALLIES WHERE THEY COMING FROM AND UNDER IT TO A- WHAT KINDS OF. WOULD BE A TO HELP CONTROL THAT OUT. AS YOU KNOW WE PUTTING CON TRACE AND HOPE. IN PLACE AND TRAINING THEM WE I'VE- REGISTERED. TRACERS SO THERE'S ALL KINDS OF PREPAREDNESS PIECES THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE AND WILL BE USING THIS INFORMATION TO HELP US. DECIDE AT THE STATE LEVEL AND LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS WILL BE USING THAT INFORMATION TO USE OF THE LOCAL LEVEL TO UNDERSTAND IT'S ANY TYPES OF ADDITIONAL- CHANGES IN THE CURRENT- ORDERS WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR THEM. THANK YOU. YEAH KNOWING WHAT WE KNOW NOW WOULD WE HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF ESTABLISHING SOCIAL DISTANCING STANDARDS AND QUARANTINING THOSE THAT WE KNEW WERE MOST VULNERABLE THE ELDERLY AND THOSE WITH UNDERLYING HEALTH ISSUES SWEDEN DID. THEN ORDERING THIS AT HOME ORDER. SO YOU KNOW WE EARLY ON OUR STATE HOME ORDER INCLUDED VARIES A CLEAR LANGUAGE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE OLDER- HAVE COMORBIDITIES SHOULD SHOULD STAY AT HOME AND THAT PROVISION HAD STAYS HAS STAYED IN PLACE EVEN WITH THE GRADUAL LIFTING OF OUR STAY AT HOME ORDERS OUR STATE HOME ORDERS ARE PUT IN PLACE HOWEVER AT THAT TIME BECAUSE THERE WAS TOO MUCH POPULATION MOVE. WE WERE SEEING THE GROWTH AND NEXT WILL GROW THICKER IS STARTING TO GO IN THAT THAT WE KNOW IN EPIDEMIOLOGY SHOWS THAT YOU ARE AT YOUR HAVING A RATE THAT THAT REQUIRES ACTION AND SO YOU KNOW I FEEL LOOKING BACK AT WHERE WE WERE AND THE ACTION THAT WE TOOK THAT IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AT THE TIME WE ARE AND I AM STILL BELIEVE THAT IT WAS IT IS THE RIGHT THING I THAT WE DID ALSO. THANK YOU WHAT A MOVE ON TO SEE TO THE IS FROM ONE OF MY LOCAL BOARD. DAVE NOW SENATE TO PRINT SIR. IN BEING GETTING INTO FROM THE- AND 50% 50% OF PARENTS WHAT THEIR THEIR CHILDREN BACK IN SCHOOL AND 50% DON'T. AND ABOUT COMING BACK TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS. SO MY QUESTION I GUESS WOULD BE WHAT QUESTIONS IN DATA SHOULD FAMILIES CONSIDER ON WHETHER TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN BACK TO SCHOOL. SO I UNDERSTAND THIS IS A VIRUS THAT IS NEW TO US AND THINGS THAT ARE NEW. AND COME WITH UNKNOWNS- CAN LEAVE PEOPLE FEELING A LITTLE BIT. SCARED SOMETIMES AND ALSO ANXIOUS AND I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING DURING THIS TIME PERIOD IS TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS THEY NEED TO MAKE THAT THAT BEST DECISIONS FOR THEM AND FOR THEIR CHILDREN I WILL TELL YOU THAT OVER THE YOU KNOW WE RELEASED A GUIDANCE. FOR THE WAYS IN WHICH SCHOOLS WILL BE REORGANIZED TO AT- TO HELP REDUCE THE RISK OF INFECTION AND OVER THE COMING WEEKS BEFORE SCHOOLS OPEN IT WILL BE LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARENTS TO SPEAK IN PARTICULAR WITH. WTH THEIR- LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND THEIR SCHOOL SYSTEMS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT CHANGES WERE PUT IN PLACE AND TO THINK VERY CLEARLY ABOUT. ABOUT A WHAT'S BEST FOR THEIR CHILDREN BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT THAT GUY THAT WE PUT IN PLACE AB IN. AND I AND IT IS THERE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TAX THE AND WEALTHY OF ARCH. AND OUR AND- WOULD NOT BE. AND TING IT WOULD THINK THAT WE WERE AT THE RIGHT TIME COMES OF THE MOVEMENT OF CODE NINETY. TO CREATE. SCHOOL AND. THE WAY IT WOULD REDUCE THE FOR COVER NINETEEN AND AS WE HAVE. SO WHO IS GOING TO MONITOR AND ENFORCE THAT- ELEAZAR ACTUALLY PERFORM THE DUTIES THAT ARE THAT ARE OUTLINED IN THE GUIDELINES. I DID ALL OF THIS HAPPENS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- AND THE DETAILS OF THAT I DON'T HAVE FOR YOU BUT I CERTAINLY CAN GET BACK TO YOU WITH THEM OKAY GREAT THANK YOU. MOM WHAT GUIDANCE IS BEING GIVEN AS FAR AS IN INSURING MITIGATION PLANS ARE IN PLACE AT A STUDENT STAFF MEMBER TEACHER OR RELATED FAMILY MEMBER TEST POSITIVE FOR KOBE NINETEEN. SO ALL OF THAT GUIDANCE IS B. IS BEING DEVELOPED IN THE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT WE ALSO HAVE IT FOR THE WORK ENVIRONMENT AND IT INCLUDES- INFORMATION IN THERE THAT YOU'LL SEE ABOUT. IF SOMEBODY TEST POSITIVE- TO EVALUATE AND ASSESS CLOSE CONTACTS OF THAT INDIVIDUAL MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THAT INDIVIDUAL SHOULD BE. WARRANTY AND IF THERE. OUR CONTACT OR OR ISOLATED IT- IF% THEY'RE POSITIVE AND- AND THEN THE KIND OF DISINFECTING THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN THE SCHOOLS AS WELL SO ALL OF THAT IS CLEARLY OUTLINED IN THERE AND IS VERY CRITICAL LAST THANK YOU MOVE ON TO A COUPLE OF THE BUSINESS QUESTIONS SO I KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS LIKE IT YOU KNOW MADE A DATA AND ALL THAT WE'RE ALL ON THE FRONT LINES DEALING WITH. PEOPLE AND I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES I CONVERSATION AS WITH GROWN SUCCESSFUL MAN CRYING. BECAUSE THEY WERE THEY WERE LOSING THEIR BUSINESS. AND A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE THAT HAVE INFORMATION SELECT PEOPLE WHO KNEW ME SO I HAD SITUATIONS WHERE AT CAR DEALERSHIPS. THE LOCAL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LOCAL OWNERS WHO KNEW ME. FOR CLOTHES BECAUSE THEY KNEW THEY HAD TO CLOSE AND RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET IS SOME YOU KNOW CORPORATE. CAR DEALERSHIP THAT YOU KNOW THEY'RE HEADQUARTERED IN FLORIDA AND THEY'RE OPEN. BECAUSE A LOT OF FRUSTRATION AND I DON'T REALLY BLAME THAT ON ANYBODY BECAUSE THIS WAS ALL NEW TO US. BUT BUSH'S THIS LOCAL BUSINESSES BEGIN TO RE OPEN THAT THEY WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS EXPECTED OF THEM AND DO WHAT IS SAFE FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES AND CUSTOMERS IN MANY CASES THERE'S OVERLAP IN FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS BUSINESSES NERVOUS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO COMPLY ESPECIALLY CAN INCIDENTS WHERE THE BAKER I CLEAR DIRECTIVES SO HOW WAS THE DEPARTMENT COORDINATING WITH LOCAL COUNTY INSPECTORS THANK YOU KIDDING WITH BUSINESS WHEN THERE IS A JURISDICTIONAL OVERLAP. STILL IN THE STATE LEVEL WE PUT OUT GUIDANCE FOR SECTORS AS THEIR RE OPENING AND THAT IS POSTED ONLINE THAT PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT KINDS OF MODIFICATIONS SHOULD BE MADE FOR A SECTOR TO OPEN. ULTIMATELY THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER THOUGH IS THE INDIVIDUAL WHO JUST SA IT MAKES THE DECISION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THAT SECTOR TO BE OPENED IN THAT. BECAUSE THAT PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER HAS THE BEST INFORMATION ABOUT THE MOVEMENT OF DISEASES THAT COMMUNITY UNDERSTANDS BEST WHETHER OR NOT. THE RIGHT MOMENT FOR THEM SO THAT DECISION IS REALLY BEING MADE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. NOW IF THERE'S OTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE JURISDICTIONAL- DECISION MAKING I THINK IT WOULD PERHAPS VERY IF THERE'S SPECIFIC SECTORS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AND I CAN GET BACK TO YOU ON THE DETAILS OF THAT BUT IN% GENERAL THAT'S THE WAY THE SECTOR DECISIONS ARE MADE ON THE RESPONSIBILITIES MCCARTY. THANK YOU. NOW THE STATUS GIVEN APPROVAL FOR AMUSEMENT PARKS TO OPEN- BEGINNING JULY SEVENTEENTH. YET ARE WONDERFUL- COUNTY STATE FAIRS WHICH HAVE A LARGE YOUTH EDUCATIONAL COMPONENT TO THEIR PROGRAMMING. ARE STILL WAITING FOR GUIDELINES TO BE ISSUE. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WELL WHEN THOSE MIGHT OCCUR. SO I DON'T HAVE SO WHEN WE MAKE DECISIONS IS REALLY FOLLOWING THE DAY SO I ALSO- THE DATE THAT YOU HAVE ABOUT- PARKS OPENING AND OTHERS WE WILL NEED TO CONFIRM ALL OF THAT- AND WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC DATE. OUT OUTSIDE FOR THESE OTHER SECTORS RIGHT NOW WE'RE FOLLOWING THE DATA AND HAS IT BECOMES AS WE RECOGNIZE. THAT DIFFERENT SECTORS ARE READY TO OPEN AND THEN WE'LL MAKE THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE. SO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FAIR IN LET'S SAY MAGIC MOUNTAIN OR DISNEY LAND. YEAH SO THE GUIDANCE FOR- FOR- PARKS TO OPEN HAS NOT BEEN RELEASED YET OKAY I THOUGHT IT WAS ALL RIGHT. OKAY VERY GOOD THANK YOU. MOVING ON THIS IS FROM NUMBER QUESTIONS FROM AND ANOTHER SENATOR SO- WHY ARE WE NOT DOING REGULAR SCIENTIFICALLY MONITOR TESTS ARE RANDOM SAMPLES OF THE POPULATION TO SHOW THE EXTENT OF A SYMPTOMATIC INFECTIONS OVER ON SECTIONS AND THE RATE OF SPREAD. SO THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE TO DO SURVEILLANCE TO UNDERSTAND THE SPREAD OF DISEASE ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES WE'VE HAD OUR- IN GAME CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN VERY LIMITED SUPPLIES AND LACK OF ACCESS TO TESTING. SO CALIFORNIA THAT WAS VERY PROACTIVE CREATING A TESTING TASK FORCE WHICH HAS WORKED AGGRESSIVELY THROUGH PRIVATE PART OF PRIVATE PUBLIC PARTNERSHIPS WORKING WITH OUR- ACADEMIC PARTNERS AS WELL TO REALLY RAMP UP TESTING AND TODAY WE ARE AT OUR GOAL AND WE CONTINUE TO INCREASE WERE OVER SIXTY THOUSAND. TEST THE DAY WHICH IS WHERE WE NEED TO BE WE NEEDED TO HAVE ADEQUATE TESTING HOWEVER TO SERVE THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WHO NEEDED THE INFORMATION FOR A MEDICAL DECISION MAKING AND ALSO WE PRIORITIZED FRONT LINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS. AND OTHERS AROUND CONCRETE SETTINGS ON IT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE AT GREATEST RISK WOULD BE PROTECTED SO THAT IS WHERE WE HAVE TARGETED OUR TESTING TO DATE. AS HAS BECOME MORE AVAILABLE WE ARE PUTTING IN PLACE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS JUST TO WHAT YOU ARE SPEAKING TO THAT WILL ALLOW US TO UNDERSTAND BETTER THE SPREAD OF DISEASE ACROSS THE STATE. GOOD IDEA OF WHERE I CLOSE NINETY THE HIGH SPOTS ARE BECAUSE OF WHEN THERE IS- TESTING NEEDED. A FAIR AMOUNT OF TESTING GETS DONE AND WE UNDERSTAND THE LEVEL AND SO FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE BEEN CUT FOLLOWING- THE TEST POSITIVITY WHICH HELPS US UNDERSTAND. THE KEEPING KEEPING IN MIND ALSO THE LEVEL OF TESTING. THAT THE RATE OF- CASES IN A COUNTY AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO US AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND STATE LEVEL AND WILL BE MOVING FORWARD AND YOU'LL HEAR MORE. FROM US- IN IN THE IN THEIR NEW YOU'RE NEAR FUTURE ABOUT SURVEILLANCE AND- MORE INFORMATION THA WILL BE COMING AS TESTING BECOMES MORE BROADLY IS AVAILABLE GREAT THANK YOU. I NURSING HOMES VULNERABILITIES HAVE BEEN KNOWN FOR MONTHS DESPITE THING THAT THEY ARE PRIORITY FOR TESTING WHERE WE ARE TESTING EVERY RESIDENTS STEP PERSON ON A REGULAR BASIS. SO IT OF IT IS BECAUSE OF THE- PRIOR VERY LIMITED TESTING- CAPACITY THAT WE HAD BUT WE ACTUALLY HAVE PUT IN PLACE NOW POLICIES. FOR TESTING EVERY INDIVIDUAL IN EVERY IN NOT. ILL NURSING FACILITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO BASELINE TESTING. IT HAS BEEN- I. REQUIRED IN THAT AND ALSO THESE LETTER WHICH GOES OUT TO- LICENSED FACILITIES THAT THEY WILL BE DOING TESTING NOT ONLY OF EVERY RESIDENT BUT ALSO- THE HEALTHCARE WORKERS AS WELL AND THEN THERE IS A MECHANISM IS PUT IN PLACE IF A POSITIVE TEST IS FOUND WHAT THE HELL OFTEN REPEATING- TEST WILL NEED TO BE DONE. AND IF I'M- IF NO CASES ARE FOUND. THEY WILL ALSO HAVE TO CONTINUE. TESTING SUBSETS OF THOSE EMPLOYEES. TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO NEW CASES INTRODUCED SO WE ARE ON A PATH RIGHT NOW WE'RE MOVING AGGRESSIVELY THROUGH THIS AND WE REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT TESTING IS ESSENTIAL IN THOSE ENVIRONMENTS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE READ DIRECTING A LOT OF OUR TESTING RESOURCES RIGHT NOW. GREAT THANK YOU ARE DELIVERING THE INSTRUCTION RATE REMAIN THE TOP STATE GOAL OR HAS BEEN REALLY REPLACE WITH THE DESIRE TO RE OPEN THE ECONOMY EVEN IF THE INFECTION RATES GO UP. IF SO HOW HIGHER RATE WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE. SO WE HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE SINCE WE STARTED OPENING SECTORS THAT ASK PEOPLE MOVE MORE MORE PEOPLE WILL GET INFECTED WHICH ALSO MEANS OUR CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. HAS TO BE ON THE READY AND IT ALSO MEANS THAT ARE CONTINUING MONITORING OF THE CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM AND THE NUMBER OF. PATIENTS THAT ARE ADMITTED NAY NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS AND I SEE YOU CONTINUES. A DAILY ALONG WITH ALL OF THE OTHER A MONITORING- THAT WE'RE DOING. THERE IS NOT A SET NUMBER OF SOME LEVEL OF INDIVIDUALS THAT IT'S OKAY TO BE INFECTED THAT'S NOT A WAY TO DO PUBLIC HEALTH IT'S NOT A WAY. TO MAKE PUBLIC HEALTH DECISIONS BUT IT IS. QUESTION MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT SECTORS RE OPENING SO THAT PEOPLE CAN CONTINUE TO MOVE THAT PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT WHEN YOUR OUT YOU USED TO FACE COVERINGS WHEN YOU'RE A PUBLIC THAT YOU KEEP THAT DISTANCE THEN THAT YOU WASH YOUR HANDS FREQUENTLY IS REALLY GOING TO BE THE THING THAT ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS TO TAKE CONTROL ABOUT. THEIR LEVEL OF RISK- EVERY DAY WHEN THEY AKE A DECISION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE. FURTHERMORE IN OUR WORK ENVIRONMENT THE GUIDANCE THAT WE'VE PUT OUT IT'S ALSO BEEN CREATED IN A WAY. THAT WOULD HELP REDUCE THE RISK FOR COVERT NINETEEN BUT AS WE MOVE MORE THE RISK WILL. CONTINUE TO BE THERE AND SO WE ARE ON THE READY IN CASE HERE ARE MORE CASES TO BE ABLE TO DETECT THEM AND ALSO TO RESPOND WITH OUR CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. THANK YOU THIS KIND OF A RANDOM QUESTION BUT I'M JUST CURIOUS. NINETY FIVE MASS TO THE COMPARED. NINETY FIVE MASS BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE'S A LOT MORE SOURCES. OF CAYENNE NINETY FIVE SO. BASICALLY THAT OPEN ENDED FOR YOU. YEAH THAT'S A VERY TECHNICAL QUESTION THAT I'LL NEED TO GET BACK TO YOU ON BUT IT CERTAINLY RELATES TO LIKE THE FIT AND APPROVAL- OF THOSE OF THOSE NOW. WE'RE GETTING NEAR THE END I AND I APOLOGIZE TO EVERYBODY BUT- THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT SENATORS YOU KNOW WANTED ASKS AND WHEN I'M HAPPY TO BE THEIR VOICE. SO YOU MENTIONED EARLIER THAT- ON MARCH NINETEENTH AND I KNOW I WAS CAUGHT OFF GUARD I WAS WATCHING EVERYTHING ON TV WHEN THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED A- YOU KNOW. THE STATE HOME ORDER. AND AS WE'VE GONE ALONG ALSO I KNOW THESE YOU KNOW THESE DIFFERENT OPENING UP TO WHATEVER HAPPENS. SO CAN YOU WALK ME THROUGH THE PROCESS I MEAN OBVIOUSLY HE'S HE'S THE FINAL DETERMINANT ON THAT BUT- IS THERE SOMETHING WHERE. YOU DECIDED YOU YOU TELL HAMMERS- TEAM OR- HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU MAKE THOSE DETERMINATIONS AND WHO ULTIMATELY BESIDES THE GOVERNOR HAS THE FINAL CALL. I'M SORRY SENATOR YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE STAY HOME ORDER YES. AND YOU MENTIONED EARLIER THAT YOU THE ONE THAT MADE THE CALL IN THE NINETEENTH AND SO AS WE'VE PROGRESSED. WHAT'S WHAT'S THE PROCESS FOR DETERMINING HOW WE OPEN UP. OKAY SO AS SO- AS THE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER AND- I AM THE ONE THAT WRITES THE ORDERED TO STAY HOME ORDER AND AS IT GETS MODIFIED THOSE MODIFICATIONS NEED TO BE CHANGED. I NEED TO. PUT OUT A NEW ORDER IF IT'S DIFFERENT THAN THE EXISTING ORDER SO WHILE I DO SIGN THE ORDER AS A DIRECTOR OF THE- CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH AND STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER. THAT DECISION IS MADE- BASED UPON OUR- THE LA CONVERSATIONS WITH EXPERTS ACROSS MY DEPARTMENTS- WE ARE LOOKING AT THE DATA AND- WE'RE TALKING- NOT ONLY AMONGST OURSELVES BUT WE ARE ALSO WORKING. THROUGH OUR AGENCY WITH SECRETARY DOLLY. WE ARE HAVING A CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL WE'RE WE'RE INTEGRATING ALL OF THE DATA THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE THE BEST DECISION- WHILE I SIGNED THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFF. ORDER OF COURSE IT IS. AS THE DIRECTOR OF A TECHNICAL AGENCY I IN GIVING TECHNICAL ADVICE TO THE GOVERNOR'S FOR HIS ULTIMATE DECISION MATING MAKING AS USE INTEGRATING INFORMATION ACROSS ALL OF GOVERNMENT BUT I'M PROVIDING A TECHNICAL RECOMMENDATION. FOR OUT FOR AN OR IN THE CASE OF THE STATE HOME ORDER THAT A STAY IN ORDER WOULD BE RECOMMENDED AND THEN ULTIMATELY. THAT DECISION IS MADE I DO I AM THE ONE THAT SIGNED IN TERMS OF THE DISK. THAT YOU. ARE MOVING FORWARD IT'S VERY MUCH THE SAME PROCESS WE HAVE COMMITTED TO ANCHORING OUR DECISIONS BASED UPON THE DATA WE SHARED WITH YOUR SIX INDICATORS THAT WE USE GOING FORWARD TO UNDERSTAND THE STABILITY. OF ARE CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. THE AMOUNT OF PREPARATION AND PREPAREDNESS WE HAVE ACROSS THE STATE- BROADLY AND THEN ALSO IT COUNTY LEVELS WERE ALSO WATCHING THAT VERY CAREFULLY AND SO THOSE DECISIONS ARE ALL MADE BY INTEGRATING THE DATA AND THINKING. ABOUT A FIRST AS WE ROLLED OUT OR AS WE DESCRIBED IN OUR PANDEMIC ROAD MAP. THAT THE DIFFERENT STAGES THAT FIRST PHASE IS THE FIRST LOOK AT LOWER RISK- WORK ENVIRONMENT DOES WORK ENVIRONMENTS THAT WITH MODIFICATION- COULD OPEN EARLIER AND THEN WE'VE BEEN BUILDING OUT TO THOSE THAT MAY BE- MORE RISKY MORE RISKY BECAUSE THEY RE IN. SALT IF. POPULATION AND SO AGAIN THAT INFORMATION IS BEING USED AND SYNTHESIZED OUT TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS USING THE BEST EVIDENCE THAT WE HAVE FOR KEEPING CALIFORNIANS HEALTHY GREAT THANK YOU FINAL. I WANT TO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALL THE TIME YOU USE USE THAT SPENT WITH US TODAY I DO WANT TO SHOOT A FINAL QUESTION- CENTER BASE TO TALK EARLY ON ABOUT YOU KNOW A VACCINE AND NOT ME I. WORK HEARING ALL THESE TIME LINES AND THEY SEEM VERY- AMBITIOUS TO ME BUT DO YOU BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE A WORKING VACCINE IN PLACE BEFORE WE CAN COMPLETELY OPEN UP CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW I THINK. PART OF THIS IS THAT WE MUST HAVE TREATMENT AND THERAPY AT A MINIMUM TO BE ABLE TO- TO BE ABLE TO. EAT AT. I MEAN STEP WISE PROCESS RIGHT SO. SO AT THIS TIME THE TREATMENTS THAT WE HAVE REALLY ARE. VERY LIMITED. AND THEY ARE FOCUSED ON WHEN PEOPLE ARE VERY SICK. SO AS MORE TREATMENTS POTENTIALLY BECOME AVAILABLE THAT MIGHT BE YEARS EARLIER- MIGHT EVEN BE USED FOR A SYMPTOMATIC PEOPLE THERE MIGHT BE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE CAN THINK ABOUT HOW MEDICAL TREATMENTS. A MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS BE THE VACCINE OR- TREATMENTS. MAY PROVIDE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO- TO. TO OPEN UP OR MAKE DECISIONS A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY. WE CAN'T. WHEN IT HAPPENED- BUT WE HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR FROM THE BEGINNING THAT AS LONG AS A LARGE POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA. REMAINS THE VULNERABLE TO THIS VIRUS. ARE RETURNING TO WAIT THE WAY IT WAS BEFORE WILL BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND UNLIKELY. ARE REALLY YOUR ANSWERS IN YOUR TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN LET ME GO TO SENATOR ROTH. THANK YOU MAYOR PRO TEM. DOCTOR GOOD AFTERNOON AFTERNOON DISAPPEARED FROM MY SCREEN I KNOW I I'M HAVING THE SAME- I CAN'T SEE YOU EITHER I'M SEARCHING. NO NO YOU DISAPPEARED AGAIN I. WELL ONE THOUGH SO WE CAN CONTINUE I WAS GOING TO SAY CONGRATULATIONS BUT HAVING. SITTING HERE FOR A WHILE I THINK CONDOLENCES MIGHT BE IN ORDER. BUT WE ARE VERY LUCKY TO HAVE YOU AND I THINK YOU. YOU DESERVE NOT TO HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR ME SO LET ME JUST MAKE ONE ONE COMMENT YOU KNOW THERE'S CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OUR ECONOMY AND OUR SOCIETY. THAT DON'T. TURN ON WITH A LIGHT SWITCH THEN I REALIZE IT'S DIFFICULT TO PLAN WITH THIS COVERT NINETEEN. BUT IN THE FUTURE WHEN WE ARE ABLE TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE PREDICTABILITY WHEN IT COMES TO CONVENTIONS AND CONVENTION CENTERS OR EVEN OUR- INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION. IF AT SOME POINT YOU CAN AS A DEPARTMENT AND CALIFORNIA'S THE STATE CAN PROVIDE TARGET DATES FOR RE OPENING I THINK THAT WOULD BE VALUABLE. IN TERMS OF PREDICTABILITY AND ALLOWING THESE INSTITUTIONS WHETHER IT'S A VISITORS AND CONVENTION CENTER OR WORK WHETHER IT'S A COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY BUT TO BEGIN TO PLAN TO BRING PEOPLE BACK TO THAT PARTICULAR OF VENUE WHERE THAT PARTICULAR FORUM SO. I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU HOW APPRECIATIVE I AM OF THE THOUGHTFUL WAY THAT YOU AND THE GOVERNOR AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE BEEN ROLLING OUT OF THE RE OPENING- I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE THE STICK. AND YOU'RE TAKING CARE OF US AND PAYING ATTENTION TO OUR HEALTH AND SAFETY SO WITH THAT I HAVE NO QUESTIONS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO MOVING YOUR CONFIRMATION AT THE APPROPRIATE POINT IN TIME. THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR ROTH AYE AND- YEAH I YOU GOTTA FIGURE WHICH SCREEN TO LOOK AT- SO I ALSO WANT TO ADD MY CONGRATULATIONS ODD NOTICING THAT YOU WERE HERE PROBABLY ABOUT FIVE MONTHS OF A WHEN WE EXPERIENCE MID MARCH AND- THE PANDEMIC IN FRONT OF US. I HOPE IT ALLOWED YOU TO GET YOUR BEARINGS BEFORE YOU HAD TO SHIFT INTO SUPER HIGH GEAR- I THINK MY COLLEAGUES OF ASK ALMOST ANY QUESTION I COULD. I ACTUALLY. AS FACILITATOR CHAIR IT MAKES MY JOB EASIER I ONLY HAVE ONE LAST AUDIT TOPIC AND I KNOW THAT IT'S SOMETHING YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH BECAUSE THERE WAS FEEDBACK I TO THE ADMINISTRATION AND I KNOW HAT I'VE HEARD THE GOVERNOR COMMENT ON IT BUT- EARLY ON- IN EARLY OR WILL MARCH SOON AFTER MY COLLEAGUES AND I WENT HOME OUR AND RECESSED. I GOT A COUPLE OF ARTICLES FOR MEMBERS OF MY COMMUNITY FROM THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY AND THEY WERE SAYING TO ME THAT ARE MEMBERS OF MY COMMUNITY WERE AT HIGHER RISK OF CODE NINETEEN WILL OF COURSE I AM I DON'T HAVE THAT DATA SO I HAD MY HI HEALTH STAFF CONTACT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND IN FACT THEY TOLD US NO THEY THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE- IT I BELIEVE AND GO INTO THE DATA AND THE ARE THE EXPERTS. BUT I DO WANT TO SAY THAT- NOT KEEPING THE DATA AS IT RELATES TO LGBT Q. NON BINARY- INDIVIDUALS ALTHOUGH I RECOGNIZE THE DIFFICULTY- AS YOU ARE IN CAN BRING SOMETHING THAT WE DIDN'T ANTICIPATE A PANDEMIC THAT BECAME VERY. OUR EVIDENT VERY QUICKLY THAT WE OBVIOUSLY HAD A REAL PROBLEM. BUT ARE SO HOW YOU'RE PREPARED TO COLLECT DATA AND DO THAT BUT- YOU KNOW FROM HISTORY ARE THOSE FROM OUR MARGINALIZE MINORITY ETHNIC COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS GENDER. HISTORICALLY WOMEN. HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT OF THE DATA AND THE STUDIES AND THE NUMBER SO IT'S VERY HARD FOR US TO. DRAW ANY CONCLUSIONS FROM THAT SO I JUST KIND OF WOULD LIKE YOU TO RESPOND TO THE- ISSUE OF LGBT Q. OUR DATA RELATED TO THE NUMBERS OF COVERT NINETEEN. AND ALSO AT MOVING FORWARD I HAD A WE INTEND TO. ADDRESS THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. YEAH A LOOK AT- WE WON'T UNDERSTAND HOW TO RESPOND TO HEALTH INEQUITIES OF WE'RE NOT MEASURING THEM WE WON'T FIND THEM SO WHAT WE DON'T COLLECT IS AS IMPORTANT AS WHAT WE DO COLLECT. AND WHEN WE SEE GAPS WE NEED TO BE PROACTIVE ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE DEVELOP MECHANISMS TO BE ABLE TO COLLECT THAT DATA TO UNDERSTAND IT AND I THINK WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LGBT Q. MORE TALK ABOUT RACE ETHNICITY WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THESE THINGS THAT WE KNOW ARE SO IMPORTANT TO OUR COMMUNITY OUR- STATE VALUES THESE ARE AREAS THAT WE NEED TO LOOK. VERY CLOSELY AT SO I CAN TELL YOU I'M COMMITTED MY DEPARTMENT IS COMMITTED TO LOOKING ACROSS- OUR DATA SOURCES AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT. WHERE DATA IS BEING COLLECTED AND WHEN IT'S NOT ON HOW CAN WE AND IF IT'S POSSIBLE. TO ADDRESS THOSE GAPS- WHEN IT COMES TO- SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER I. IDENTITY INFORMATION AROUND THE LGBT. TATE ARGUE COMMUNITY AND MAKING SURE THAT WE- UNDERSTAND- WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT. WITH THROUGH THE LENS OF COVERED NINETEEN RIGHT NOW THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF DATA SOURCES THAT WE HAVE. AN UNDERSTANDING HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PUT PROVISIONS IN PLACE THAT WOULD HELP US COLLECT THAT THAT INFORMATION- UP FOR ONE EXAMPLE IN CONTACT RAISING- YOU KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE WRAPPING UP ACROSS THE- STATE. I EVERY COUNTY. THAT FIFTY ONE COUNTIES TO AT THIS POINT I KNOW ARE INTERESTED IN USING OUR PLATFORM. AND MOVING FORWARD AND- WE ARE MAKING THAT PLATFORM AVAILABLE TO THEM AND THROUGH THE DESIGN AND MODEL OF OUR CONTACT TRACING- THE QUESTIONS THAT WE PUT IN THERE THAT ARE PART OF THE STANDARD QUESTIONS WILL INCLUDE QUESTIONS THAT WILL HELP US UNDERSTAND THIS COMMUNITY BETTER. AND SO AS WE MOVE FORWARD THROUGH- COVERED NINETEEN THIS INFORMATIONAL BECOME RIGHT MORE READILY AVAILABLE THAT WILL HELP US UNDERSTAND- WITH WHAT THE RISKS ARE OR MAY NOT BE WHERE ARE. WHERE ARE COMMUNITIES RESILIENT AND WHERE ARE THEY NOT RESILIENT WHERE DO WE NEED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. TO HELP US REALLY- ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. THAT'S RECORDED NINETEEN BUT I THINK YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT ONCE WE PUT IN PLACE FOR KOBE NINETEEN CONTACT TRACING- THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN MODEL AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN. CARRY THAT FORWARD IN OUR WORK EVEN BEYOND COVERT NINETEEN WERE ALL COMPETENT AT SOME POINT WE WILL BE BEYOND COVERED NINETEEN. BUT WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE THAT MOST EXCELLENT PRACTICES AND LEARNING IS THAT WE HAVE FROM THIS EXPERIENCE AND SO WE WILL CARRY THAT ORDERED AS WELL. DR THANK YOU I THINK YOU AT THE VERY END YOU HIT THE POINT THAT I WAS GOING TO GO TO NEXT WHICH IS. IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL TO. KIND OF. PUT THAT IN PRACTICE GOING FORWARD. WITHOUT HAVING TO DO A. PIECE OF LEGISLATION OR BUILD MANDATE BUT THAT IS WHAT EVERY CAN. IS TO DO IN THE- FIVE NOT JUST IN. BUT EL. AND WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA IS. YOU KNOW FRANKLY GIVEN OUR UC SYSTEM OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM EVERYTHING HERE- PUTS US IN A POSITION TO BE CUTTING EDGE AND HELP OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY IN THE WORLD AND SO. I APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWER ON THAT- VERY MUCH BECAUSE IT'S SO MEANINGFUL. TO US SO MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS IN CALIFORNIANS SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. I'M MORE. LET THE SENATOR BATES HAS ONE MORE COMMENT OR QUESTION DOCTOR ANGEL SO LET ME TURN IT OVER TO HER FOLLOWED BY A DURING THE QUESTIONING- FROM ALL OF THE GOOD VICE CHAIR. REGARDING THE DATA AND I THINK IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION REGARDING THE DATA THAT'S USED FOR OPENING UP. A VERY A FIVE FACILITIES AND NOW I ENTERTAINMENTS IN CALIFORNIA THERE WAS A BIG A PROBLEM IN ORANGE COUNTY WHEN OUR BEACHES WHERE IT OPENED AND YET LOS ANGELES COUNTY'S BEACHES WERE. THEY HAD A HIGHER- DEATH RATE THEY HAD A HIGHER AYE INFECTION RATE A HIGHER- HOSPITALIZATION RATE. SO THE CONSTITUENTS GET UPSET WHEN THERE IS KIND OF A COOKIE CUTTER APROACH. TO AND IF YOU CAN OPEN AND NOT OPEN AND THE E. R. COMMUNITIES HAVE NOT ON. THOSE HIGH NUMBERS HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW VERY DIFFERENT DISENGAGE AND ARE SUPPORTING. OUR HEALTH WORKERS SO ARE YOU IS THE BEACH EGGS HOLD BECAUSE THERE WAS NO REASON THAT ORANGE COUNTY'S BEACHES COULDN'T OPENED AT THE SAME TIME THAT STILL QUESTIONABLE BY. COMMUNITY THAT HAD HIGHER RATE FOR OPENED IN A WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO. SO I GET FIFTH MAYBE NOT A QUESTION CIVIC DURING BILL BUT. NO REQUIRE GOING FORWARD. YEAH THERE IS MORE OF A- INDEPENDENT VIEW OF THE DAY **** FROM A COULD. SO THOSE WHO ARE AND I KNOW ACT. IS DEALING WITH SOME ABOUT PRESENTLY BECAUSE I'VE READ MOST OF THOSE REPORTS BUT I THINK IT'S REAL IMPORTANT FOR THE COMMUNICATION TO COME OUT ABOUT YOU WILL BE LOOKING MORE AT OUT THOSE SPECIFIC. DATA IN REACHING THOSE DATA POINTS BEFORE YOU CAN OPEN AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TO GIVE SOME CONFIDENCE A TO COMMUNITIES AND IN PARTICULAR BUSINESSES BECAUSE BUSINESSES FOLLOWING THE GUIDANCE OF FAIR THEY SHOULD NOT IN ANY WAY. BE HELD BACK NOT NOT TO OPEN JUST BECAUSE SOME COMMUNITY AROUND THEM IS NOT OPENING AND I THINK THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF THE CONFIDENCE LEVEL GETTING CONSUMERS BACK A TO OUR BUSINESS SAW MARKETPLACE IN ENSURING THAT THE BE ALL COMMUNITIES INDIVIDUAL WHO THE CONSUMER SPECIFICALLY. ARE ABIDING BY THE RULES REGULATIONS THAT THAT BUSINESSES HAVE TO PUT OUT BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF THIS DISENCHANTMENT IS HAPPENING THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE A COOKIE CUTTER APPROACH COMING OUT OF THE STATE AND THEN EACH. MONEY HEALTH DEPARTMENT IS EITHER GOING TO ABIDE BY THOSE STRICTLY BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID OF SOME LIABILITY WHEN YOU'RE TELLING US THAT THEY HAVE INDIVIDUAL FORTY TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS SO I THINK THE COMMUNICATION BEEN POOR AND I'M GOING OUT THE COMMITTEE I SERVE ON. I WILL BE BRINGING OUT UP THAT THERE HAS TO BE SOME STANDARDS IF THE COUNTY HEALTH OFFICER HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY THEN THEY SHOULD BE BACKED UP BY A STATE THAT THEY CAN USE THAT DATA AND NOT- THAT COMES IN A GUIDANCE AS TO GENERAL WERE TOO RESTRICTIVE. IN TERMS OF WHETHER THAT PARTICULAR AREA OPEN NOT OPEN IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR US FEET OF. LEGISLATORS AND ANSWER ANY THE PRESENT SORRY FOR THE TRY TO EXPLAIN THAT I CAN'T YOU HOW. MANY CALLS AND HAND THEY CAME AND THE ANGER WAS THERE IN ORANGE COUNTY. JUST BECAUSE THE PICTURE WAS SHOWN REGARDING WHAT WAS ON THE BEACH AT THAT TIME I THINK WAS IN APRIL. IN THE PICTURE WAS TOTALLY DISTORTED BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT WAS TAKEN. AND THAT WAS USE RATHER THAN DATA THAT WAS USED TO CLOSE THE BEACHES. SO IT'S JUST A SOMETHING THAT I ANT. OUR STATE. OF MIND YOU KNOW PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO BE VERY ARE AWARE OF. BECAUSE WE CAN GET PEOPLE O DO WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO FOLLOWING THE RULES AND ONE YOU FOLLOW THE RULES IF THEY FEEL IT'S DONE FAIRLY. THANK YOU FOR THAT FEEDBACK. THANK YOU ARE SENATOR BATES SENATOR MINING HAS ANOTHER QUESTION OR COMMENT FOLLOWED BY THE VICE CHAIRMAN AND THEN I AND THEN WE'LL MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT SENATOR MONEY THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM IN. THANK YOU DOCTOR ANGEL YOU'VE BEEN GENEROUS WITH THEIR TIME IN INDULGING OUR QUESTIONS. IN MAY BE PAYING OFF A LITTLE BIT OF SENATOR BATES QUESTION ABOUT. CONSTERNATION CONCERNS BY SOME MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN SOMETIMES VOICE THROUGH THE MEDIA SOME OF THE COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS HAVE BEEN. TARGETED VILIFIED I KNOW SOME OF RECEIVED DEATH THREATS FROM WHAT CAN YOU DO IN YOUR CAPACITY TO PROVIDE SUPPORT AND BACK UP FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL WHO WERE DOING THEIR BEST TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT ARE DATA INFORMED. DRIVEN BY THE DESIRE TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH IS YOUR DEPARTMENT ABLE TO PROVIDE ANY CONCRETE SUPPORT FOR THOSE WHO ARE BEING TARGETED IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. SO YOU BRING UP A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION WHICH IS REALLY- BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ON THE FRONT LINES REALLY- USING INFORMATION TO HELP GUIDE BEST DECISIONS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL THOSE ARE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS THERE. ARE THERE THERE EVERY DAY- THERE THERE THERE'S HOURS ARE AND LISTS AND THEY'RE AVAILABLE THEY'RE RESPONSIVE AND SO- WHEN THEY ARE TARGETED AND IT'S REALLY IT'S A THREAT NOT ONLY TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR FAMILIES WHICH IS INAPPROPRIATE BUT IT'S ALSO A THREAT TO THE HEALTH OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES BECAUSE- THOSE FOLKS ARE EXPERTS AND- AND WE WANT THEM. TO BE ABLE TO BE SUPPORTED AND BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT EXPERTISE THE COMMUNITY THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC WHICH WILL BE GOING ON FOR SOMETIME SO WE ARE CONSTANTLY IN CONVERSATION WITH OUR LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS- WE HAVE REGULAR MEETINGS WITH THEM REGULAR PHONE CALLS TO DISCUSS SPECIFIC ISSUES TO TRY TO ANSWER WORK THROUGH SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY ARE. DEALING WITH SO THAT WE CAN AS A STATE. MOVE FORWARD AND HELP. HELP US ON THROUGH THE PANDA IN A WAY. THAT HELPS US GET THERE- NOT ONLY ON LAW SAFELY BUT ALSO. NOT MOST SAFELY TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO FOR OUR ENTIRE SYSTEM WE NEED THIS PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEMS IN BE INTACT WE GET. THROUGH THIS BECAUSE THERE WILL BE NO DOUBT SOME OTHER- EMERGENCY IN THE FUTURE THIS CALIFORNIA HAS. HAS AS LONG AND HISTORY OF- NEEDING TO BE RESPONSIVE WE NEED THOSE PEOPLE THERE. SO WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH THEM TO UNDERSTAND THEIR NEEDS AND TO- DO WHAT WE CAN AT THE STATE LEVEL TO SUPPORT THEM. WE WORK THROUGH THEIR- THEIR ORGANIZATIONS TO THEIR EXECUTIVE COMMITTEES AS WELL TO UNDERSTAND NEEDS AND TO BE AS RESPONSIVE AS WE CAN BE. THANK YOU FOR THAT THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM AND- JUST A FINAL COMMENT I THINK. IN YOUR POSITION PUBLICLY EXPRESSING THAT SUPPORT AND MAYBE EVEN CONSIDERING VISITING SOME COUNTIES- TO ADDRESS COUNTY BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS OR TO STAND.
