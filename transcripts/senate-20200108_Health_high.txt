WHO IS TO BE A TO YOUR BILL- I HAVE- BEEN. DOING A LOT OF RESEARCH. ON THIS PARTICULAR BILL- THE IDEAS AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PROPOSE. SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE ADDITIONAL TIME- WE HAVE MADE A MODIFICATION AND THAT IS TO MAKE IT OPTIONAL FOR COUNTIES THAT WISH TO- MODIFY THEIR DEFINITION. OF GRAVELY DISABLED. SO WE DO WE DID FIND OUT THAT THERE ARE SOME. ERRORS OR A MAYBE SOME MINOR MODIFICATIONS THAT NEED TO BE MADE- IN THE BILL AND SO WILL ACCEPT THAT AS AN AMENDMENT IF NEEDED. I THINK THAT WAS IN YOUR STAFF REPORT. JUST TO CLEAR THE TICKET WILL CLARIFY I DON'T I WAS NOT AWARE WE HAVE IF THERE IS SOMETHING WE WILL AGREE TO MODIFY. OKAY SO YEAH WE WANT MINOR LIKE THEY DIVERSE A POLICY COMMENT BUT THERE WAS WORDS. AND. WE CAN AND. IN LATE ENOUGH AS AN ERROR OKAY JUSTIN OKAY YEAH THERE IS WE DON'T HAVE A FORMAL AMENDMENTS PROPOSE THAT I'M AWARE OF ALL THE PARTS COMING DID POINT OUT THERE WAS AN ERROR. SO THAT'S WHY BILL OF SALE WE DIDN'T HAVE A ANY SPECIFIC AMENDMENTS PROPOSED THAT'S WHY I WAS THE MONEY SURE WE'RE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SO. THEN STRACK STRIKE THROUGH THE COMMENT. OKAY. ASKING OKAY I MEAN WE'RE WE'RE CERTAINLY WILLING TO ACCEPT THAT BUT. FIXED UP IF YOU DON'T MIND WILL PAUSE FOR MOMENTS HERE THEY TO CONSULT WITH STAFF YOU KNOW IT BABY MAYBE WE'VE LET'S LET'S CONFER THEIR OKAY SO. WILL TEMPORARILY- FOR A BRIEF TIME RECESS TO CONFER WITH THE AUTHOR RECONVENE HERE SO- THANK YOU CENTER MORE LACK SITE SO IT TO SO THERE IS ACTUALLY SO JUST BE SURE WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE- THERE WAS THERE'S AN ATTEMPTBY USED TO CORRECT A THIRD I WAS MENTIONED IN THE ANALYSIS BUT WE AT LEAST. TO ME DIDN'T SPECIFICALLY MENTION A SPECIFIC AMENDMENT SO WHEN USE SITES WILL BE SURE WORK AND TELL ME IF I GOT IT WRONG- THAT WHAT YOU'RE BASICALLY SUPPRESSING IS THAT YOU INTEND TO. TAKE MINUTES TO FIX THE PROBLEM IDENTIFIED ALICE'S REGARDING- A THAT THE THAT THE AIR AND THEN FIND IN ALICE'S CORRECT ALL RIGHT OKAY PLEASE RISEN THANK YOU I JUST WANNA BE SURE WE'RE ALL IN THE SAME PLACE THANK YOU. AND APPRECIATE YOUR. VERIFYING THAT- RICHARD OBVIOUSLY THE- PREEMINENT ISSUE THAT THE VOTERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS HOMELESSNESS. AND THE GOVERNOR JUST CAME OUT THIS MORNING WITH AN INCREDIBLE- PLAN THAT- I'M SUPPORTIVE OF- WITH A LOT OF- COMPONENTS- BUT WE'RE WE'RE ALL IN OUR DISTRICT STRUGGLING WITH THIS. THIS CRISIS. AND WE SPENT. THE SLASHER LOOKING AT THE LATERAN PATRICK SHORT ACT WHICH WAS A DISCUSSION WE HAD WHEN I WAS HERE LAST YEAR ON. HOW IT IS DOING THESE LAST FIFTY YEARS IN THE LETTERMAN PETROUS SHORT ACT SAID. THAT INSTITUTIONS WERE FOR MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE WORK IN YOU MAIN AND WE SHOULD CLOSE THEM. AND SO WE CLOSE THEM AND ALL. PEOPLE WENT OUT IN THE STREETS AND THEN THEY WENT INTO THE JAIL SO NOW OUR JAILS AT LEAST AN ORANGE COUNTY. MY LARGEST INST A MENTAL HEALTH INSTITUTION IS MY COUNTY JAIL IN DOWNTOWN SANTA ANA. BUT WE'VE LOOKED REALLY CLOSELY AT THIS ACTON- WE SHOULD HAVE A DOCUMENT OUT SOON ON WHAT WE'VE FOUND WE ALSO KNOW THAT. ARE NOT A NOT IT HAS BEEN REQUESTED THROUGH J. LACK HAVE WITH THE STATE AUDITOR WE SHOULD PROBABLY BE GETTING THE RESULTS OF- ELAINE HOUSE WORK IN APRIL. BUT WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT WHAT KIND OF SOLUTIONS CAN WE PROVIDE- BECAUSE MY CONSTITUENTS ARE REAL CONCERNED ABOUT HOMELESSNESS AND I KNOW WHAT YOURS ARE TOO. AND WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE MENTAL HEALTH SPACE. AND WITH THAT- WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT WHAT IS THE BEST DEFINITION FOR GRAVELY DISABLED WE'VE LOOKED AT OTHER STATES AND MAYBE JUST FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR- STAFF REPORT THAT NEVADA SAYS CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER TO SELF. AND WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE HELP. SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE THAT ARE ON THE STREETS. SO THEY'RE NOT NOT ONLY A DANGER TO THEMSELVES BUT A DANGER TO OTHERS BECAUSE- WE'RE HAVING INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE BEING CONCERNED ABOUT WHO THEY BUMP INTO AND GROCERY STORE PARKING LOT SIR. WE I JUST HAD A STACK STATE EMPLOYER FIND OUT JUST- YESTERDAY. I WAS ATTACKED AT A LOCAL STARBUCKS BY A HOMELESS PERSON WHO MAY HAVE HAD. SOME MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. SO WITH THAT- WE'RE WE'RE- KIND OF THE KIND OF COME TO THE CONCLUSION AS A LAY PERSON NOT AS A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL BUT- AT REALIZING THAT MAYBE A FIFTY ONE FIFTY. SEVENTY TWO HOUR HOLD ISN'T GOING TO CUT IT FOR A LOT OF. INDIVIDUALS SO WITH THAT IF SOME COUNTIES HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CAN PROVIDE- FOR THE SERVICES OF INDIVIDUALS OF THIS NATURE THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO OPT IN. WE DID IT WAS SAN FRANCISCO RECENTLY WITH SB ONE OH FOUR FIVE WOULDN'T TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND- SB FORTY JUST LAST YEAR WITH THE PILOT FOR NOT ONLY SAN FRANCISCO BUT LA AND SAN DIEGO. SO WHY NOT IF THERE ARE OTHER COUNTIES THAT ARE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE. WE SHOULD. GIVE THEM THE OPTION ORANGE COUNTY HAS BEEN WORKING VERY DILIGENTLY. ON ESTABLISHING A NETWORK TO HELP MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE WE JUST HAD DURRELL STEINBERG AND DOCTOR TOM INSULT. IN OUR COUNTY TO DEDICATE A BUILDING IN MY DISTRICT WHICH IS SIXTY THOUSAND SQUARE FEET TO HELP THOSE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS SO. IF THEY ARE WILLING TO MODIFY THE DEFINITION WE SHOULD GIVE THEM THAT OPPORTUNITY- BECAUSE WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING I THINK% THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE- SOLUTION THE DILEMMA- HAS BEEN IN THE- OF THE- OPPOSITION IN THE MAIN OF OPPOSITION MY CONCERN IS BEEN. THE LACK OF FACILITIES SO THE LETTERMAN PATCHER SHORT ACT SAID WE SHOULD CLOSE THE MENTAL HEALTH INSTITUTIONS MOVE THEM INTO COMMUNITY. FACILITIES BUT- FIFTY YEARS LATER WE DON'T HAVE COMMUNITY FACILITIES WHAT WE DO HAVE NO PLACE LIKE HOME WHICH WE APPROVED. LAST YEAR WITH PROPOSITION. TWO AND SO WE ARE HOPEFULLY STARTING TO BUILD SOME- FACILITIES IN STRUCTURES AND EVEN TODAY'S- PRESS RELEASE BY THE GOVERNOR SAID LET'S PUT ANOTHER SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION INTO. START BILLING AND PROVIDING A PLACER PAYING FOR RENT WE SHOULD ALSO BE WORKING ON THE SPACE OF HOW DO WE PROVIDE MORE INSURANCE REIMBURSEMENTS- THE CARE HOMES WERE ASKING FOR FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE SET MONDAYS LA TIMES ARE GETTING SOMETHING. HOPEFULLY IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR TODAY IN AND IN HIS BUDGET- ON THE TENTH. AND WE NEED TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO WITH I AM DE WAIVERS TO TRY AND GET. MORE FUNDING DOWN TO THOSE THAT ARE OUR SYSTEM THESE INDIVIDUALS. BECAUSE WE NEED TO PROVIDE SOME KIND OF COMMUNITY FACILITIES BUT WE NEED TO START THE MOMENTUM COLLEAGUES. AND ACHIEVE SOME SUCCESSES AND COUNTIES WILLING TO STEP UP TO THE CURRENT- SITUATION INSTEAD OF JUST LETTING PEOPLE DIE ON OUR STREETS LA COUNTY IS LOSING THREE PEOPLE A DAY ON AVERAGE. THAT ARE HOMELESS ON THE STREETS. SO I BRING THIS OUT OF A SOME KIND OF EXPERIENCE MISTER CHAIR. WHEN WE HAD A SCHIZOPHRENIC HOMELESS PERSON- KILLED IN FULLERTON BY THE NAME OF KELLY THOMAS. DOCTORS AND PARENTS CAME TO ME AND SAID WE SHOULD HAVE ADOPTED LORES LAW SO I WORKED WITH SENATOR STEINBERG AND WE DID SB FIVE EIGHTY FIVE IN TWENTY THIRTEEN. GOT ME UP HERE A LOT AND HAD A LOT OF FUN WORKING ON IT- BUT IT WAS APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE SIGNED BY GOVERNOR BROWN AND IT PROVIDED A LITTLE BIT OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDING- PROP SIXTY THREE TO FUND FOR LORDS LOS ORANGE COUNTY BECAME THE SECOND COUNTY AFTER NEVADA COUNTY. AND NOW WE HAD SEVENTEEN COUNTIES THAT HAVE FOLLOWED SUIT. JUST HAD A RECENT STUDY THAT SAID THAT THAT'S ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT PROGRAM IS NOT ONLY WORKING WELL IN THOSE NINETEEN COUNTIES. BUT WHY AREN'T THE OTHER. THIRTY NINE COUNTIES STEPPING UP AND DOING THE SAME THING SO WE HAVE SOME SUCCESS. SO THAT'S WHY I'M IN THIS SPACE MISTER CHAIR- BECAUSE I THINK THIS SB SIX FORTY PROVIDES A SIMILAR. STRATEGY WE WOULDN'T LEAVE SOMEONE WITH ALZHEIMER'S OUT ON THE STREET. BUT THIS BILL SAYS. THAT IF YOU ARE INCAPABLE OF MAKING INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT OR PROVIDING FOR THE PERSON'S OWN BASIC PERSONAL NEEDS FOR FOOD CLOTHING OR SHELTER WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT SUPERVISION AND ASSISTANCE FROM ANOTHER PERSON WE SHOULD WE SHOULD BE HOUSING YOU AND WE SHOULD BE DIAGNOSING AND WE SHOULD BE PROVIDING THE APPROPRIATE MEDICTION WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN NEW IN THE LAST FIFTY YEARS OR WE CAN GET YOU- GET THAT THAT PERSON NORMALIZED IN BACK INTO THE MAINSTREAM SOCIETY WE'VE GOT TO GET THEM ON A PROGRAM. AND SOMETIMES IT TAKES LONGER THAN SEVENTY TWO HOURS SO IN A TEMPORARY INVOLUNTARY HOLD IS MORE BENEFICIAL THAN INCARCERATION WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW SO I'VE HAD A LOT OF FUN MISTER CHAIR ON THIS BILL I'M NOT A DOCTOR BUT I HAD FUN MEETING WITH DOCTOR TOM INSEL WHO HAS A WONDERFUL NATIONAL REPUTATION SO WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE HIM HERE AT THE STATE. AND WE HAVE I HAD THE CHANCE TO MEET WITH DOCTOR JONATHAN SHARING WHOSE- THE MIDDLE HEALTH DIRECTOR IN LA COUNTY AND JUST VERY IMPRESSIVE- ALSO BEEN WORKING WITH THAT DR DREW PINSKY WAS ALSO PSYCHIATRIST WHO'S BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF BUT I'M TREATED SCHIZOPHRENIA MAKES THE CONDITION MORE DETRIMENTAL IF WE DON'T TREAT THESE PEOPLE THEY ACTUALLY DEGRADING GET WORSE SO THE SOONER THE BETTER AND THEREFORE I AM STRONGLY ENCOURAGING AN AYE VOTE ON SENATE BILL SIX FORTY TO. ASSIST THOSE THAT. WE NEED TO HELP ON OUR STREETS WHICH IS. CRITICAL AT THIS TIME IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU BEFORE WE BEGIN WITH WITNESSES I DO SEE THAT WE HAVE A QUORUM SO I'M GOING TO ASK THAT THE SICK RECALL THE ROLE TO SUBSEQUENT. CAM PAN HERE GONZALEZ GONZALEZ HERE GROVE. GROVE HERE HER TADO. ATTARDO HERE LEYVA. LEYVA HERE MITCHELL MITCHELL HERE MINING RUBIO. WE HAVE A QUORUM OKAY THANK YOU SO WITNESSES REPORT WELCOME MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JOSH PANAY ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND MY FAMILY AND MY FRIENDS. FIVE I THE MY MOM WAS SCHIZOPHRENIC FOR FIFTY NINE YEARS- WAS ON THE ON AND OFF THE STREETS. FIVE AND THE SYSTEM WE HAVE IN PLACE ISN'T WORKING. I COULD TELL YOU A VARIETY OF STORIES BUT- A GREAT STORY IS IN THE CHRONICLE ON SATURDAY THIS GENTLEMAN. HAVING REAL PROBLEMS OUR SYSTEM IS IGNORING THEM HE'S ON THE STREETS HIS SISTERS HAVE TRIED TO HELP AND THEY'VE GOTTEN NO WHERE. WITH THE CENTERS TRYING TO DO IS PROVIDE COUNTIES WITH THE FLEXIBILITY TO SEE THESE PEOPLE THAT WE WALK BY EVERYDAY ON THE STREETS. THE SACRAMENTO HAS TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN ITS FINE TODAY. BUT THE COUNTY DOESN'T HAVE THE JURISDICTION TO ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING- THAT'S THE PROBLEM- SO I WOULD URGE YOU TO HELP THIS ALONG RIGHT NOW. I SAW THAT THE NEXT TIME WE WALK BY ONE OF THESE PEOPLE ON THE STREET WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO CALL SOMEBODY SOMEBODY BESIDES THE POLICE AND GET THEM SOME DIRE NEEDED HELP- SO MISTER CHAIRMAN I'VE SPOKEN TO YOU ABOUT THIS BEFORE- THIS FIRST TIME I'VE SPOKEN PUBLICLY HI AND SO IT'S A LITTLE HARD FOR ME AFTER FIFTY NINE YEARS OF MY MOM SUFFERING- IN AND OUT OF STATE HOSPITALS. I'M NOT A BIG ADVOCATE OF A MAN STATE HOSPITALS HAVE BEEN SEEN THEM WHEN I WAS FIVE AND TEN ELEVEN AND TWELVE AND FIFTEEN GOING TO VISIT MY MOM. BUT THERE IS A POINT IN TIME WHERE WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT FOLKS WHO NEED OUR HELP AND I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH THIS- IT JUST A BRIEF FROM SENATOR NICK PETROUS IS ORAL BIOGRAPHY. AND IT'S JUST A SMALL PIECE AND I COULD HAVE A COPY OF THIS IS THAT IT'S A FOUR HUNDRED PAGE BY OUR ORAL OR A BIOGRAPHY BUT- CENTER PICTURES WHO I KNEW. IN THE LPS. BASICALLY SAID- UPON REFLECTION IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE SO IS LAW WENT INTO EFFECT IN SIXTY SEVEN HE AND LANCE FOR MEN AND SHORT AND THIS IS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE HE SAID WELL I TELL YOU WHAT I WOULD SAY IF SOMEONE LEFT ME ON THE STREET BASICALLY IS WHAT HE'S SAYING I'D SAY DAMMIT DON'T I HAVE A RIGHT TO TREATMENT. IF I HAD BROKEN MY LEG OR HAD A HEART ATTACK YOU'D BE SWARMING ALL OVER THE PLACE TO HELP ME BY DOCTORS NURSES THIS WAY AND THAT WAY SO I JUST LEAVE YOU WITH THAT I'LL MAKE A COPY OF THIS THE TO ONLY ABOUT THIRTY PAGES IS PRETTY INTERESTING READING TO SEE WHO THE PLAYERS WERE ON BOTH SIDES WHO WAS AGAINST IT WHO WAS FOR IT- THEY HAD TOTAL OPPOSITION- WELL AS THEY ARE WORKING THEIR WAY THROUGH IT BUT I THINK IT'S INTERESTING FOR ALL OF YOU TO READ THIS. PIECE OF HISTORY FROM SENATOR PATRIS IT WAS THE FACT THIS GUY HE WAS THE LIBERAL LAND TURMAN WAS THE LIBERTARIAN AND SHORT WAS OF BY THE SENATOR WHO JUST WANTED SOME COMMUNITY FACILITIES HE THOUGHT THAT WAS THE BEST THING THAT COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN SO I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS BUT I REALLY APPLAUD THE SENDER'S EFFORT YOUR EFFORTS MISTER CHAIRMAN YOUR ALL YOUR EFFORTS BUT NOW'S THE TIME TO START MOVING THIS PROGRAM ALONG GIVE THE COUNTIES THE FLEXIBILITY. WITH THIS TYPE OF LANGUAGE THEN PUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS INSTEAD OF THE THIRTY FIVE MILLION THAT GOT TO LEAD FROM THE BUDGET LASHER PUT A HUNDRED MILLION TO THE COUNTIES WHO WERE WILLING TO GO OUT AND TRY TO DO SOMETHING WITH THESE FOLKS AND HELP THESE FOLKS WITH TREATMENT AND THEN HELP THOSE COUNTIES WHO ARE HELPING WITH CITIES WORKING TOGETHER AND GIVE THEM PRIORITY WHEN THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO WORKS WITH THE COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO THEY GET PRIORITY FOR THESE FUNDS TO HOUSE THESE PEOPLE. AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A HOME WHERE KILEY THEN. THAT IS MY MOM COULD DO. DO A AT. WE NEED TO PUT. KING IS THERE STOP BURKE THE MAN IN THAT SO I'D OR CHIU BEST OF THIS LONG FOR TODAY AND THEN KEEP WORKING ON ALL OF THESE THINGS BY AND GIVE US ALL HOPE WHEN WE WALK WHEN I DOMY FIVE MY WALK EVERY MORNING GIVE US HOPE THAT I CAN CALL SOMEBODY SOMEBODY BUT THE CHIEF OF POLICE AND SAY HEY COME AND HELP THIS WOMAN. SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT BACK MICROPHONE. NAME ORGANIZATION AND SIMPLY POSITION SUPPORT AFTERNOON THE MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS LARRY MORSE BEHALF CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU. MY NAME IS MERION BERNARD AND I SPEAK AS A LAWYER VERY FAMILIAR WAS SUPERIOR COMPLETE COMMITMENT LAWS IN OTHER STATES AND AS THE MOTHER OF A SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL YOUNG ADULT ON BEHALF OF MANY OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS WE BELIEVE THAT SB SIX FORTY SHOULD BE ADOPTED STATEWIDE AS SHOULD LAURA'S LAW. BUT BUT- SO WILL AT THE BACK MICROPHONE ITS NAME ORGANIZATION AND POSITIONS SO WE HEAR TESTIMONY AT THE- TABLE. ALL RIGHT WELL. IT NEEDS TO BE AMENDED UP BECAUSE IT FORCES PERRANCE TO THROW THEIR CHILDREN ON THE STREETS IN ORDER FOR THEM TO BE CONSIDERED GRAVELY DISABLED IT HAS HAPPENED TO ME PERSONALLY IT IS HAPPENED TO MANY OTHER PARENTS. THIS IS A PROBLEM I KNOW HOW TO FIX IT. I HAVE THE LANGUAGE. I WILL BE HERE AND I WILL BE OUTSIDE THIS CONFERENCE ROOM WHEN THIS HEARING ENDS. SO THAT I CAN TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT THAT AND I WILL ALSO EMAIL YOU DR OKAY AND ACTUALLY IF YOU HAVE SOME A LANGUAGE OR SOME HAS MADE YOU WANT TO. SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEE PLEASE- PRESENTED THE SERGEANTS AND WE'LL BE HAPPY TO ACCEPT THAT. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. PERSECUTE US HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SANTA MONICA IN SUPPORT. OKAY THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT I SEE NO THE WITNESSES A SUPPORT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE COME UP TO THE TABLE. SHOULD GO BACK. KAY AND ASSUME YOU'VE COORDINATED YOUR TIME. OKAY THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR- MEMBERS KERR CHILD DISABILITYRIGHTS CALIFORNIA- UNFORTUNATELY WE- CONTINUE TO HAVE AN OPPOSE POSITION TO THIS BILL- RULE THE BILL WAS ESSENTIALLY THE BILL THAT WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO- DISCUSS AND DEBATE- LAST YEAR AND- AS WE RACED AT THAT TIME A NUMBER OF OUR CONCERNS PARTICULARLY- FIRST OF ALL THIS DEFINITION ITSELF AN ENTIRELY NEW DEFINITION THAT WE WOULD TRY TO JACK THE POND- R. LPS SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA WHICH WE WOULD SUGGEST YOU KNOW SUCH TERMS IS MAKING AND FOR IN CAPABLE OF MAKING INFORMED DECISIONS AND WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT SUPERVISION ARE ALL UNDEFINED- TERMS THROUGH THROUGHOUT THE STATUTE THAT. WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT THAT WOULD REALLY THROW INTO DISARRAY ARE LPS SYSTEM THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- IT ALSO PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF TREATMENT- WHICH ALWAYS IS A MATTER OF CONCERN- IN LOOKING AT- WHAT- MAY HAVE BEEN A PERSON- WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES IN THE PAST BEING USED TO- TO ACTUALLY- INVOLUNTARILY- CONFINE THEM AT THE PRESENT TO- TIME- SO IT I THINK OUR MAJOR CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS A PARTICULARLY AS WE'RE HAVING I THINK SOMEWHERE THE CONVERSATIONS IS A SENATOR MENTIONED AS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED NELSON- WILL WHAT APPEARS TO BE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO START LOOKING AT- BOTH HOUSING. AND SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT'S BEEN OUR POSITION ALL ALONG ON THIS IS LET'S PUT THE NOT PUT THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE LET'S FOCUS ON MAKING SURE WE GOT SERVICES IN PLACE- FOR- FOR INDIVIDUALS- BEFORE DOING ANY TINKERING WITH- THE STATUTORY- DEFINITION. I WILL JUST ONE YEAH BECAUSE THIS VERSION OF THE BILL NOW INCLUDES THIS OPTION- FOR COUNTY STOPPED IN AND OUT IN THAT WOULD PUT US IN AN EXTRAORDINARILY- DIFFERENT POSITION THAN WE HAVE BEEN THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE COURSE OF LPS WHERE. WE'VE BEEN STRIVING TO UNIFORMITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE- IN APPLICATION OF LPS- YOU WOULD HAVE COUNTIES- RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER POTENTIALLY- EMPLOYING DIFFERENT STANDARDS FOR- DETERMINING WHETHER A PERSON SHOULD BE INVOLUNTARILY HELD AND AGAIN THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT IS THE CIVIL RIGHTS WE THINK. LPS AS HAS BEEN FOR THE DECADES THAT WE'VE HAD IT- REMARKABLY SUCCESSFUL IN CONTINUING ON THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE CIVIL RIGHTS F INDIVIDUALS AND THE NEED TO PROTECT THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND- OTHERS. AND SO AGAIN WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE CONVERSATION SHOULD HAPPEN IN THE CONTEXT OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE AS OPPOSED TO TRYING TO SWEEP MORE PEOPLE INTO A SYSTEM THAT WE KNOW IS AT CURRENT TIME ILL EQUIPPED TO HANDLE THEM SO WE WOULD URGE AND A LOT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS- TIRE IN THE WITH THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION- REGRETFULLY WE ARE OPPOSED TO SB SIX FORTY- THIS BILL WOULD CREATE ADDITIONAL CONFUSION ON FOR WHO IS APPROPRIATE FOR CONSERVATORSHIP. I'MA CREATES DISPARITIES ACROSS THE STATE OF WHO IS- ELIGIBLE FOR CONSERVATORSHIP AND THEN IT PROVIDES NO ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO COUNTY GOVERNMENTS- FOUR OR PROVIDERS TO ADEQUATELY TREAT AN EXPANDED POPULATION- A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF COUNTIES TODAY DO YOU PLACE INDIVIDUALS- OUTSIDEOF THEIR COUNTY INTO- LOCKED I AM DIS AND BARDING CARES BASED ON THEIR TREATMENT NEEDS. AND SO YOU MIGHT HAVE A SITUATION WHERE A COUNTY- THAT HAS OPTED INTO THIS EXPANDED DEFINITION WOULD PLACE AN INDIVIDUAL INTO A COUNTY THAT HAS NOT OPTED IN- AND SO YOU MIGHT HAVE SOMEONE WALKING ON THE STREET I'M STREETS WHO COULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS EXPANDED. UNDER THE EXPANDED DEFINITION WHILE SOMEONE ELSE IS ALREADY BEING TREATED SO WE SEE THIS SIDE SCREENING DISPARITIES IN CONFUSION OF WHO WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR CONSERVATORSHIP ACROSS THE STATE- ADDITIONALLY THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE DID APPROVE AN AUDIT OF THE LPS ACT BACK IN JUNE OF LAST YEAR. BUT SET TO BE RELEASED IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR AND RELUCTANT TO SUPPORT ANY CHANGES THE LPS ACT UNTIL WE SEE ANY- THE FINDINGS FROM THE AUDIT. AND HAVE TIME TO REVIEW AND ASSESS THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE STATE AUDITOR- CONSERVATORSHIP PROGRAMS ARE CURRENTLY IS SERIOUSLY UNDERSTAFFED AND UNDERFUNDED TODAY ANDIN A STUDY BY THE PUBLIC GUARDIANS ASSOCIATION. THEY'RE CURRENTLY UNDERSTAFFED BY ABOUT 20% ACROSS THE STATE AND THIS BILL DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR AN EXPANDED POPULATION- WE ALSO VIEW THAT. THE COURTS ARE THE ONES THAT MAKE THE ULTIMATE DECISION OF WHO IS PLACED ON A CONSERVATORSHIP AND THIS DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY CLEAR GUIDANCE TO THE COURTS. OF WHO IS THE APPROPRIATE FOR CONSERVATORSHIP AND WE DO SEE ACROSS THE STATE THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN WHO IS CONCERNED- BY THE COURTS- DECISIONS. SAU AND THERE'S BE EXISTING NON. THAT ALSO DOES NOT PROVIDE CLARIFICATION TO ON THE COURTS AROUND A HOW MUCH TREATMENT HISTORY CAN BE ICLUDED THERE IS AN EXISTING PROVISION OF THE LAW THAT DOES ALLOW- HISTORY IT WITH AND THE COURT DECISIONS I'M IN A CONSERVATORSHIP CASE. BUT THERE'S NOT GUIDANCE ABOUT HOW MUCH HISTORY CAN BE INCLUDED AND WE DO SEE I'VE OUT IT'S AN ISSUE BUT THIS BILL IS NOT SEEKING TO STOP THAT WITHIN. THE EXISTING LAW SO AND FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE FORTUNATE WE OPPOSED TO SB SIX FORTY THANK YOU. I THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION NAME AND ORGANIZATION AND POSITION. AFTERNOON CHEN FLOOR ON BEHALF OF WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE APOLOGIZE FOR NOT GETTING UPDATED LETTER IN BUT WE REMAIN IN OPPOSITION. IF YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ALEX HAWTHORN WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WE'RE IN A OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION- WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS AROUND THE PRACTICAL- IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BILL AND OUR ABILITY TO TREAT PATIENTS WHICH IS OUR PRIORITY. IF THE BILL IS FOR TODAY WERE COMMITTED TO KEEP KEEP DOING THAT DIALOGUE WITH SENATOR WE HAVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS ARE LETTER. OKAY. MY NAME'S ALLISON MONROE I'M FROM OAKLAND. I AM IN. I EIGHT. AM AGAINST THE RECENT AMENDMENTS THAT SEEM TO WATER DOWN MISTER MORLOCKS BILL I KNOW MR MORLOCK UNDERSTANDS OUR PROBLEMS WE'RE PARENTS. OF THE SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL I REPRESENT FAST ME AND ALAMEDA COUNTY WHICH IS. FAMILY MEMBERS ADVOCATING FOR THE SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL. I HAVE A DAUGHTER WHO IS CONSERVED RIGHT NOW. BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT SHE WON'T END UP HOMELESS OR IN JAIL LIKE. THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE STATE'S TEN THOUSAND SICKEST. AND THE WAY TO DECIDE WHO NEEDS TO BE CONSERVED IS WHAT IS BEST FOR THEM TO KEEP THEM ALIVE AND HEALTHY. MA'AM THE MAN OF MY SHIRT HE LIVES IN THEM BARKERVILLE CAMP OF THE- YEAR YEAH I SEEN YOUR POST RIGHT. I'M SORRY I'M NOT FAMILIAR ENOUGH ITH YOUR PROCESS SO I WANT WHATEVER MISTER MOORE Là WANTS TO BE DONE WITHOUT THE RECENT AMENDMENTS I SAW OKAY AS I KNOW HIS HEART IS IN THE RIGHT PLACE. YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. THESE TEN THOUSAND ARE NOT GOING TO TESTIFY HERE THEY'RE LOCKED UP THERE IN JAIL THERE HOMELESS THEY DON'T KNOW THEY'RE ILL FOR THE MOST PART. SO THE PARENTS HAVE TO COME IN REPRESENTED AN ICY TO KEEP THEM ALIVE CONSERVE THEM IF THEY NEED MEDICAL HELP CONSERVE THEM IF THEY DON'T KNOW THEY'RE SICK CONSERVE THEM. IFTHEY'RE IN DANGER THINGS ARE OF THEM. THANKS THANK YOU. BACK MICROPHONE AGAIN ITS NAME ORGANIZATION I THINK. AND ALSO IF YOU HAVE MATERIAL YOU WISH TO PRESENT- YOU CAN. PRESENT TO GIVE THAT TO THE SERGEANTS AND WITHOUT GET TO THE COMMITTEE SELF. YOU CAN EMAIL IT TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF AS WELL WE CAN FIGURE RANGE THAT SO THANK YOU FOR COMING TESTIFIED. THE ANY OTHER WITNESSES- SEEING NONE QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ASSEMBLY GROVE. THANK YOU YOU KNOW AS READING AN ARTICLE IN WE FACE HOMELESSNESS IN EVERY COUNTY AND CITY THAT IS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS A MATTER OF FACT- WE INVESTED ALMOST BILLION DOLLARS LAST CYCLE IN WERE UP 16% HIGHER THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN THE NATION. M. ON THE STREETS OF LOS ANGELES IN TWO IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE PEOPLE DIED THERE WERE HOMELESS AVERAGE OF THREE A DAY IS WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS HAPPENING NOW AT COMPARED TO TWO HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT NEW YORK AT IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE DIED ON THE STREETS WE HAVE THE STATISTICS OF WHO THEY ARE BASED ON THE CORNERS OFFICE BY RACE BY AGE- AND A LOT OF THE- OTHER THAN THE OBVIOUS ONES THAT ARE BROKEN DOWN BY NUMBER BY. DEATH BY VIOLENCE. LIKE THAT THAT THE LIST. THERE'S EMOTIONAL DISORDERS THERE'S A LOT OF. XIN IN THIS ARTICLE THAT WAS I WAS READING THAT TALKS ABOUT. MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND THEIR INABILITY TO COPE ON THE STREET. AND WHEN I SERVED IN THE ASSEMBLY ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES AND WE RUN BUDGET SUB ONE AT WE LISTENED TO TESTIMONY AFTER TESTIMONY AFTER TESTIMONY OF THE CRUELTY THAT WENT ON IN THE STATE INSTITUTIONS DEMI SLIP AND SLIDE- ACTUAL MURDERS PEOPLE BEING THROWN OUT OF WINDOWS. JUST ALL KINDS OF STUFF THAT WAS HAPPENING IN AND THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY IN THE STATE SERVICES. AND SO THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION HAD- THAT LEGISLATION THAT WENT THROUGH AND ACTUALLY HAD CLOSURE DATES ONE OF THOSE FACILITIES IS IN YOUR DISTRICT- NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS THAT I THINK CLOSING DOWN THOSE ABUSE RIDDLED INSTITUTIONS. WITH IN DEPTH WITH- A MAJORITY OF THOSE PEOPLE BEING ON THE STREET. NOT BEING ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES NOT PEOPLE FEED THEMSELVES. WE ENCOUNTER PEOPLE EVEN IN BAKERSFIELD. AND I'M NOT A DOCTOR. BUT OBVIOUSLY WHEN YOU WALK UP WITH SOMEBODY AND THEY'RE IN A WILL TURN THE COMPLETELY ALMOST EMANCIPATED THEY HAVEN'T EATEN IN DAYS YES THERE. THEY CAN'T TALK AND THEY HAVE NO AWARENESS OF WHO THEY ARE WHAT THEY'RE DOING. AND IT'S JUST CRUEL TO LEAVE THEM OUT ON THE STREET. AND YOU ENCOUNTER OTHER INDIVIDUALS ON THE STREET THAT OBVIOUSLY ARE TALKING TO PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT THERE- ENGAGING IN TRAFFIC. OF SITUATIONS WHERE THEY CAN GET RUN OVER BY A CAR STOPPING TRAFFIC. THE YOU KNOW AND YOU KNOW CARS ARE JUST DODGED HIM AND THEY'RE OUT THERE TALKING AND YELLING TO PEOPLE THAT AREN'T THERE WILL. ON THE STREETS. AND IT'S JUST SAD THAT WE AS A SOCIETY ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN AND- YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT DEATH LIKE I SAID NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE PEOPLE IN LOS ANGELES ALONE. AND IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN. SO WHO TO AND TO ALL THE PARENTS THE THOUSANDS OF PARENTS OUT THERE THAT HAVE TO DEAL WITH CHILDREN THAT ARE DISABLED MENTALLY INCAPACITATED AND YOU CAN'T. DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT YOU JUST HAVE TO LET YOUR KID LIVE ON THE STREET OR IN JAIL. I THINK ALTERING LANGUAGE. ERR. IN A DIFFERENT THE WITNESS THAT WAS HER FROM DISABILITY RIGHTS YOU SAID YOU KNOW THERE'S CURRENTLY COUNTIES ARE IN A QUICK YOU KNOW ILL EQUIPPED TO HANDLE THIS WELL COUNTIES AND CITIES ARE ILL EQUIPPED TO HANDLE THE HOMELESS ON THE STREETS AND SO AND THERE HAS TO BE SOLUTIONS WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO HAVE HOMELESSNESS INCREASE AND NOT DO ANYTHING FOR SOLUTIONS WE CAN'T JUST THROW MONEY AT IT WOULD YOU HOUSING FIRST WHICH EVERYBODY THOUGHT THAT WAS A GREAT IDEA BUT YOU PUT PEOPLE IN HOUSING INITIALLY DICK TO DRUGS AND THEY HAVE THEIR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND THERE'S NO WRAPAROUND PROCESS. AND SO YOU CREATING AND SAFE ENVIRONMENT OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE TRYING TO GET HOUSING AND SO THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME BOUNDARIES BUT- AND I AM ALL ABOUT IT PERSON INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND THEN TO BE ABLE TO CHOOSE WHAT IS THE BEST FOR THEM BUT ALL OF THAT HAS TO COME A CAPABILITY OF THEM. MAKING CHOI S. OR THE. AND SO AT. I THINK THE OFFERING THIS BILL I THINK THE CHAIR FOR WORKING WITH HIM OVER A TWO YEAR PERIOD TO DISCUSS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE COMING UP- BUT JUST TO SAY THAT THE COUNTIES ARE ILL EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH THIS THE CAN ISRAEL EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH THE HOMELESS POPULATION IS GOING ON SO THIS GIVING THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO PICK UP THE PHONE AND CALL SOMEONE EITHER WE HAVE PEOPLE WE HAVE A WOMAN THAT WAS ON THE STE THE OTHER DAY AND I CALLED THE VICTIMS THE WOMAN'S DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CENTER THAT MY COLLEAGUE IN. AN IN THAT COUNTY AND THE KINGS COUNTY AREA TOURED WITH ME AND THEY CN TAKE HER BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED SHE'D BEEN BRUTALIZED AND SHE WAS OUT OF YOU KNOWN AT NOT CAPABLE AND OBVIOUSLY AND LIKE I SAID I'M NOT A DOCTOR BUT IT'S IT WAS VERY EVIDENT THAT THIS INDIVIDUAL WAS NOT CAPABLE OF BEING ON THE STREET TAKING CARE OF HERSELF BUT THEY CAN TAKE HER BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED. THEM SO IT'S FRUSTRATING THAT THERE'S NO WAY TO HELP THESE PEOPLE IN OF CHANGING A SMALL BIT OF LANGUAGE IN A SECTION OF CODE WILL ALLOW PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO BE HELP SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE WRAPAROUND SERVICES AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE STUFF THEY NEED INSTEAD OF JUST LEAVING THE STREET TO DIE- SB IN CALIFORNIA AND IN THE TWENTY IN TWENTY TWENTY- I SUPPORT THE BILL. CERTAINLY SIR. OKAY CENTER TARA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO. IT SEEMS THAT THIS BILL NEEDS A LITTLE BIT MORE WORK- HOWEVER I A. IT YOU KNOW I READ AN ARTICLE RECENTLY FROM THAT AN OP ED FROM A MOTHER AND MY DISTRICT ARE AND I KNOW THAT THE HOMELESS ISSUE WAS BROUGHT UP BUT I KIND OF I'M THINKING OF THIS BILL IN A DIFFERENT- WAY I'M THINKING AND I WANT TO SHARE A COUPLE LINES THAT THE THAT THE MOM SHARED ABOUT. HER EXPERIENCE. SHE WROTE- HE SAT ON THE TRAIN TRACK AND HE WAS PRAYING WHEN HE DIED. AND IT WAS THE HARDEST DAY OF MY LIFE. THOSE ARE TEARS NO PARENT EVER WANTS TO SHED. AND HEARTBREAK NO MOTHER OR FATHER EVER WANTS TO FEEL. HE WAS TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD AT THIS HAPPENED ABOUT A HERE AND- FIVE MONTHS AGO- HE BATTLED WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA. AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE. AND HE HAD A HOME HE WAS AN HOMELESS I THINK THAT- THAT WE REALLY DISCARDED PINK AND FOCUSED AND ON HELPING PEOPLE PERIOD. AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY TO KEEP THE CONVERSATION GOING- BUT AS I MENTIONED EARLIER IT SOUNDS LIKE IT NEEDS. SOME WORK- BUT I'M DOING IT I'M THINKING OF THE MOTHER AND THE CHILD THAT SHE LOST BECAUSE NO ONE DESERVES STIR TO LOSE THEIR CHILD AND- WE NEED TO WORK ON MAKING SURE THAT THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN EVER AGAIN. THANK YOU. TURNS OUT. YOU IF YOU. NO THEY GOT THERE I AM A WHILE YOU UNDERSTAND. THE SPIRIT OF THIS STATE I CERTAINLY DO I THINK ALL OF US ARE DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE COMING FROM LOS ANGELES COUNTY SING THE ISSUE EVERY DAY TALKING ABOUT IT EVERY DAY AND NOT SEE AND ALSO WITH GOOD INTENTION- I. WOULD SAY I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE BILL HAS A LOT MORE WORK- AND SO I DO AGREE WITH THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THAT- WE HAVE AN AD AUDIT YOU KNOW THAT STILL IS IN THE WORKS- TO EVEN FIGURE OUT AND THE DEFINITION OF THE LPS AND HOW IT'S APPLIED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION AND SO I THINK THAT IN ITSELF. I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING WITH THAT DATA AND INFORMATION LOOK LIKE FIRST BEFORE WE MOVED TO HEAD. AND ALSO KNOWING THE LA COUNTY HAS A HOUSING CONSERVATORSHIP THROUGH SB FORTY. THE PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT AT THIS POINT WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT EVEN MEANS AND SO IN WHEN YOU TALK TO LA COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH AS WELL THEY'RE DIVIDED. US SOME FOLKS. DIFFERENT THING AND SO I THINK WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO BUT I LIKE TO KNOW THAT THIS CAN STILL REMAIN AND EVOLVING BILLS AT THIS TIME I WON'T SUPPORT THIS BUT I JUST WANTED TO. ENSURE YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT THANK YOU. THAT'S MITCHELL THANK YOU SINCE MY COLLEAGUE REFERENCE ME AND HER- MONEY I WANTED TO PROVIDE A CLEAR FOR CATION FROM MY PERSPECTIVE SUB ONE WE WERE A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO TALKING ABOUT THE CLOSURE OF DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS AND THE CHALLENGE WITH THE FROM SOMEONE FROM PEOPLE'S PERSPECTIVE THE DELAY IN HAVING A SCHEDULE. WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE WHO WAS BEING REMOVED FROM THE CENTERS WAS PLACED IN A HOME AND SO WHILE THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF REASONS WHY WE HAVE HAD THIS REALLY KIND OF SLOW BURN THIS UPTICK IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS IT'S NOT A RESULT OF THE CLOSURE OF THOSE TO BE SOME DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS THE REASON THEY TOOK SO LONG FOR THE CLOSURE WAS TO FIND AN APPROPRIATE COMMUNITY SADDAM PLACEMENT SO I JUST WANTED TO PROVIDE THAT CLARIFICATION THAT MAY HAVE BEEN SOME OF THE WORK THAT TOOK PLACE- ON BEFORE YOU GOT TO THE SENATE COLLEAGUE- THAT THAT. DIDN'T WANT TO CONFLATE THOSE TWO ISSUES DO WE HAVE PEOPLE IN THE STREET WHO SHOULDN'T BE WITHOUT QUESTION- DID WE- AS A STATE AS THE LEGISLATURE OF ADMINISTRATION NOTDO WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE DONE WHEN THE STATE MENTAL HEALTH HOSPITALS WERE CLOSE FORTY YEARS AGO ABSOLUTELY MUST WE DO MORE IN TERMS OF BOARDING CARE FACILITIES AND OTHER SUPPORT OF NETWORKS ABSOLUTELY BUT EVERY INDIVIDUAL THAT WAS THIS LICENSE. FOR THE CLOSURE OF DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS. WORK A BLOODY. THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION. THE THANK YOU SO I. SO I DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS CENTER MORE LOCK AND AGAIN I APPRECIATE- Y. E. YOU'RE DOING THE BILL AND I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE PRESENTED BEFORE- AT ASKS THAT WE GET SOME TIME TO WORK ON IT I KNOW WE HAVE OUR- THE PUNDITS HERE AND I THINK THEY DO RAISE SOME. SIGNIFICANT ISSUES IN TERMS OF THE BILL BY OCT I DON'T THINK WE'RE DISAGREEING ON THE PROBLEM I DON'T THINK WE'RE DISAGREEING ABOUT- SAYING THAT SAMPLE PEOPLE IN WE NEED PEOPLE TO GET HELP. AND BE SAFE PLACES. I GUESS MY CONCERN ABOUT THE BILL IS THAT IS THAT. BEFORE US TODAY AND NOW WE ARE THE POLICY COMMITTEE IS I WAS HOPING TO IS GONNA BE A LOT MORE PROGRESS IN TERMS OF RESOLVING SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED WHEN THE BILL WAS FIRST PRESENTED. SO I GUESS MY QUESTION TO YOU AND THEN ALSO SOME OF THE OPPOSITON HERE IS THAT. AND I KNOW THAT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES AND WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING AND THAT'S REALLY GOOD I KNOW YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING AND YOU'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN MANY OTHER% VERY IMPORTANT- PAST EFFORTS. IS THAT- YOU KNOW SINCE WE FIRST HEARD THE BILL LAST YEAR TO NOW- KNOWING THAT THEY'RE STILL GONNA BE SOME TIME FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR TO TRY TO WORK OUT. I MEAN WHERE ARE WE IN TRYING TO RESOLVE SOME OF THESE ISSUES WE HEARING ABOUT INCONSISTENCIES AND DEFINITION AS BLACK OF CLARITY- RESOURCES IS A LITTLE BIT OF BUDGET THING SO I'M NOT GONNA SAY THAT WELL BECAUSE WE DIDN'T TIES SPECIFIC OF ENOUGH MONEY INTO THE BILL ITSELF THAT THAT IS SOMETHING WE CAN WORK OUT THEIR NEST BY THE WAY THAT'S APPROPRIATIONS THAT'S NOT US WERE POLICY COMMITTEE. BUT I DO FEEL THAT IN TERMS OF THE ACT ITSELF THE LACK OF CLOTHES ARE DIFFERENT PETITIONS DEFINITION INCONSISTENCY I REALIZE THAT YOU AND I KNOW THIS IS A LITTLE TENSION HERE THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE SO LIKE SAYING WELL BECAUSE SOME COUNTIES ME LASTING INTERESTED OR NOT THAT NOW WE HAVE THIS FIELD COUNTY CHOICE AND THAT WAS SORT OF. YOUR WAY TO TRY COMEDY SOME OF THE ISSUES- OBVIOUSLY NOT THE SOLUTION I THINK SOME OPPONENTS LIKE BECAUSE IT CREATES DISPARITIES BUT I GUESS. WHERE ARE WE IN TERMS OF CONVERSATIONS TO TRY TO RESOLVE THE DIFFERENCES SINCE THE LAST TIME WE TALKED BECAUSE IN MANY WAYS I DON'T SEE A LOT OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THIS VERSION WE LAST HEARD AND I'M JUST CONCERNED THAT. WERE THE POLICY COMMITTEE WE PASS OUT BY SAYING WILL PLEASE CONTINUE WORKING ON IT BUT IF WE DID THIS FOR THE TIME WE STILL HAVEN'T MADE THAT MUCH PROGRESS IN TRYING TO RESOLVE THE DIFFERENCES. I AM CONCERNED THAT BURDEN. YEAH WE HAD A LOT OF TIME TO WORK ON IT THAT WERE THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE GETTING THERE LATER AND I DO FEEL RESPONSIBLE IS THE CHAIR OF THE POLICY COMMITTEE BE SURE THAT THE LEAST. WE CAN SEE AN END IN SIGHT WE ALL KNOW THAT THAT DOESN'T NECESSARY ALL COME TOGETHER IN A BILL AND THAT'S NOT THE STANDARD A HOLD. TO THIS BILL EITHER THAT WE HAVE TO GUARANTEE THAT WE HAVE A SOLUTION- WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US. BUT YOU KNOW WE ALSO DON'T WANT IT OPEN ENDED THAT'S WHY WOULD A POLICY COMMITTEE WILL BE VOTED OUT WE'RE SENDING A MESSAGE SAYING THAT YOU KNOW WE ARE TRYING TO PUSH A CERTAIN POLICY FORD SO. PERHAPS YOU CAN SPEAK TO. WHAT HAS PROGRESS SINCE. YOU INITIALLY PERCENT THE BILL AND- I'LL- ALSO ASK THE OPPOSITION TO PERHAPS TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY SEE IS WHERE DO WE THINK WE'RE GONNA EVENTUALLY LAND THIS THING ARE WERE. OUR WE ARE DO WE HAVE IRRECONCILABLE DIFFERENCES. CELLS ARE MARK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- THE TWO FOCUSES HAVE BEEN THE LANGUAGE AND THE FACILITIES. I'VE BEEN MORE FOCUSED ON THE FACILITIES. I THINK THE ISSUE OF LANGUAGE IS A WEAK ARGUMENT. AND SO I HAVEN'T FOCUSED ON THAT WE HAVE FIFTY DIFFERENT STATES WE'VE BEEN ANALYZED. THEIR DEFINITION OF GRAVELY DISABLED- I APOLOGIZE I DIDN'T BRING YOU. THE SPREADSHEET BUT WE HAD SOMEONE FROM THE STATE LIBRARY DO A RATHER THOROUGH REVIEW OF. WHAT IS- GRAVELY DISABLED AND THEN HOW IS IT WORKING IN THAT STATE AND THE BROADER THE DEFINITION THE LOWER THE HOMELESSNESS. SO I DIDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ARGUING ABOUT. THE DEFINITION OR ARE ARGUING ABOUT THE CIVIL RIGHTS ASPECT BECAUSE I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE CIVIL RIGHTS. OF ALL CONSTITUENTS. WE'RE DEALING WITH A TERM YOU KNOW LEARNING NEW WORDS HERE IN THE SENATE BUT TO- IN YOU RIGHT CORRECT ME BY THE END OF SIDE NAUSEA. I MEAN SOME PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE MENTAL ILLNESS THEY THINK THEY'RE FINE. AND THAT ISN'T THE CASE. AND SO I'D. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT EVERYONE ELSE. OUT LAST WEEK IN LA WE HAD A HOMELESS PERSON GO INTO A CAFE. STAB PATRONS DIED I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS MENTAL ILLNESS BUT ON THE EAST COAST WE HAD A MENTALLY. ILL PERSONS GET FOR ANY OF THAT WALKED INTO A RABBI'S HOUSE WITH A MACHETE AND STABS FIVE PEOPLE- SO WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE. ADDRESSED AND I COULD I YOU KNOW I DIDN'T WANT TO COME HERE WITH THAT LET ME MISTER CHAIR OF WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT BUT I WAS MORE CONCERNED ABOUT. THE INFRASTRUCTURE THE STATE HAS FAILED. FOR FIFTY YEARS TO PROVIDE THE COMMUNITY FACILITIES FOR THOSE THAT WERE RELEASED FROM. IT'LL HEALTH INSTITUTIONS I WANT TO THANK SENATOR MITCHELL FOR CLARIFICATION- WE'RE CLOSING A DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER WHICH IS DIFFERENT- AND SO. BUT BUT FIFTY YEARS AGO WE CLOSED. THE STATE INSTITUTIONS AND THEY MIGRATED AND NOW MY CENTRAL JAIL IS THE BIGGEST MENTAL HEALTH INSTITUTION IN LA IS THE SAME AND SO. YOU KNOW WE FELT WE DIDN'T WHICH WE SAID LET'S DO LETTERMAN PETROUS IN CLOSE THE FACILITIES BUT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO OPEN SOMETHING ELSE SO THAT'S BEEN THE FOCUS. AND SO WE HAD NO PLACE LIKE HOME IT PASSED BUT ALL OF LAST YEAR. WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR COUNTIES TO SUBMIT GRANT APPLICATIONS SO THAT'S BEEN THE PROCESS AND NOW HOPEFULLY THIS YOUR BILL BE. APPROVED IN WILL START EITHER ACQUIRING EXISTING FACILITIES OR BUILDING SOMETHING I KNOW IN ORANGE COUNTY- WE HAVE A LAND TRUST THAT WAS APPROVED- HOUSING TRUST IT WAS APPROVED BY THIS LEGISLATURE- BILL CARRIED BY. THIS ASSUME IN A DAILY THAT I WAS A CO AUTHOR OF AND WE'RE TRYING TO. LOCATE TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED SUPPORT OF HOUSING UNITS IN AND SO THE COUNTY OF ORANGE IS ALREADY LOCATED AND STARTED. BREAKING GROUND ON ONE MENTAL HEALTH FACILITY IT WILL BE ANNOUNCING SOON A SECOND AND HOPEFULLY A THIRD TO WORK WE'RE TRYING TO DO BUT- AT LEAST IT'S A COUNTY THAT'S TRYING TO DO SOMETHING BUT IF WE DON'T GIVE. PROFESSIONALS THE RIGHT. TOOLS AND WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF SPENDING SO MUCH MONEY BUILDING THINGS IF YOU CAN'T. HOLD SOMEONE IT ACTUALLY TREAT THEM UNTIL THEY NORMALIZE BECAUSE THEN THEY'RE GONNA LOOK AT US AND SAY WHY DID YOU TAKE SO LONG. WHY DID YOU TAKE SO LONG TO TAKE ME UP THE STREETS. OUT ORANGE COUNTY I'VE BEEN AMAZED ABOUT HOW PREVALENT. MENTAL ILLNESS IS I HAVE SOME WONDERFUL CONSTITUENTS BRIGHT SMART PEOPLE AND THEY'LL HAVE A CHILD THAT HAS BIPOLAR OR DEPRESSION OR SCHIZOPHRENIA. I HAD A GOOD DOCTOR FRIEND OF MINE. YEARS AGO SAID TO ME I SAW MY DAUGHTER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TWO YEARS SHE WAS WALKING ON TUSTIN BOULEVARD. I'M EXCUSE ME- SHE'S SHE'S SHE'S SHE'S BETTER NOW YOU KNOW BUT SHE'S BUT IT BUT IT WHICH IS ON A ON A MEDICATION PROGRAM AND YOU'RE GONNA STAY ON THE PROGRAM- AND IF THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO GET THESE PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS. AND TOOK THAT'S BEEN THE FOCUS MISTER CHAIR IS THAT WE'VE GOT TO. MOVE FORWARD ON BOTH INITIATIVES. THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE FACILITIES THE ABILITY TO HAVE SOME INVOLUNTARY HOLDS TO HELP NORMALIZE THESE PEOPLE AND SO THAT'S WHY I FOCUSED ON THAT. BECAUSE I'M CONCERNED ABOUT ALL THIS RIGHT TO MEANT WHEN A CONSTITUENTS AS I DON'T pBECAUSE THERE'S PEOPLE IN THE PARKING LOT OR SCARED ME EITHER. TAKING MY CAR HANDLES ARE DOING THANK. YOU NOTE. WE GOT CIVIL RIGHTS FOR EVERYBODY TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT'S WHY I MADE THE FOLKS AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THE WRONG ANSWER. LONG LONG ANSWERS GET. A CELL BUT PERHAPS- I CAN PASS. THE OPPONENTS CAN ALSO SPEAK TO WEAR DAY. IT IS. THANK THANK YOU SIR YES- WINNERS THAT. UP I WOULD WANT TO POINT OUT THAT. THIS OF COURSE WAS IS NOT THE FIRST BILL THAT WE'VE DEALT WITH IN THE LAST FEW YEARS- ON THIS VERY ISSUE AND AS YOU KNOW SENATOR WIENER. HAD HIS LEGISLATION THAT- ESSENTIALLY CREATED WITH THE AND- THREE COUNTIES ONE OF WHICH IS LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO WHO IS THE ONLY COUNTY. WHICH IS THE ONLY COUNTY NOW THAT'S IMPLEMENTING THAT INTO THAT WAS I THINK. A PRETTY HARD IGHT. CRAFTED APPROACH TO TEST WHAT WAY BE AN ALTERNATIVE TO A DEFINITION. FOR GRAVELY DISABLED IN THE CONTEXT OF THAT. THAT HAS SET UP A PRETTY STRICTLY- CONFINED- TEST WITH SO. SIGNIFICANT EVALUATION. CRITERIA THAT TO AFTER THE PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS THAT WE WILL GIVE US. A LOT BETTER UNDERSTANDING. OF WHAT IT IS TO JUST YOU KNOW FIDDLE WITH THE DEFINITION. WHAT WHAT ARE. LIEU MAJOR CONCERN- THAT WE FOCUS ON. IS AGAIN AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE LPS. IS YOUR A- A WHOLE ARRAY OF. PROCESSES THAT IS USED TO DETERMINE- WHETHER AN INDIVIDUAL SHOULD BE HELD DUE TO A RISK TO THEMSELVES OR OR OTHERS AND INCLUDED IN THAT IS REALLY CRAFTING THE RIGHTS THAT GO ALONG- WITH THAT IT'S SORT OF PICK OFF ONE PIECE- OF LPS- WHICH WOULD BE THIS DEFINITION. SKEWS THE ENTIRE APPROACH WE WOULD SUGGEST- TO- HOW HOW WE- MAKE THE DETERMINATIONS ON WHETHER THE PERSON HAS A REST OF THEMSELVES OR OTHERS- CAM IN FINE JUST HAD ONE OTHER POINT THAT I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND I APPRECIATE SENATOR. MITCHELL RAISING THIS IS THAT'S REALLY A FUNDAMENTAL DISTINCTION THAT WE AS A STATE MADE- BACK WHEN- THE LAND SHERMAN ACT WAS CREATED% FOR THE PURPOSES OF PERSONS WITHOUT DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WE SHOWS IN CALIFORNIA THAT THOSE WERE MORE DESERVING. WAS A MORE DESERVING POPULATION THAN THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES FOR THE THAT POPULATION WE CREATED AN ENTIRE STRUCTURE WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ENSURES EVERY INDIVIDUAL HAS A TREATMENT PLANT HAS REGIONAL SERVICE DELIVERY. AND THE AYE AYE IT IS- REMARKABLE SUCCESS TO ALTERNATELY GET TO THE POINT THE WE'VE CLOSED THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND MOVED INDIVIDUALS NOT INTO FACILITIES BUT IN TO COMMUNITIES. WE NEVER DID THAT WITH- WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND THAT NEEDS TO BE AND I THINK PART OF THIS DISCUSSION. AIR AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW HOMELESSNESS AND ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. AND I DO HAVE AND THEN WE'LL GET T. IF YOU DON'T MIND- SO I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT SO WHAT I'M HEARING FROM YOU CENTER MORE LIVE IS THAT. HE COULD I THINK ONE OF THE CONCERNS I HAVE IS ABOUT THE DEFINITION. AND I THINK YOU SEE AN ANALYSIS OF THE INTERPRETATION AND AGAIN DIFFERENT VARIATIONS AND SO FORTH AND- IT'S AND I THINK I HOPE BUT- YOU KNOW- I. CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND. THAT YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO MAY. BOTH IT'S A CHALLENGING TO EVALUATE SOMEONE TO TELL SOMEONE THAT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU. NEED TREATMENT. BUT YOU DON'T WANT IT BUT I ACTUALLY NO BETTER THAN YOU SO YOU SHOULD GET IT. RIGHT AND WE CERTAINLY YEAH WE CAN ARE YET SAY THAT SOMEONE WHO IS IN THE THROES OF MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE IN THE BEST JUDGMENT TO DECIDE WHAT'S BEST FOR THEM BUT I THINK THAT'S A VERY YOU KNOW AT THAT GIVE THE VERY TRICKY ABOUT HOW YOU KNOW IT'S VERY TRICKY IF. TO DO THAT RIGHT TO GO AND SAY SOMEONE. SO. YOU SO ONE ISSUES FOR ME IS THAT THIS DEFINITION NOW WHAT I'M HEARING FROM DISPLAY RIGHTS IS THAT YOU KNOW WE HAD A PREVIOUS BILL THE WINNER ANY IS THERE A PLACE OR IS THERE GOING TO BE SOMEPLACE WE CAN COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON A DEFINITION- THAT THE- CARS THIS SOMEPLACE WHERE IT'S LIKE OKAY NOW I WANT REALLY BROAD ONE AND I'D BE ALL SET TO LIKE WHAT KIND O TESTS ARE WE GOING TO USE TO BE SURE THAT WERE APPLYING THIS DEFINITION APPROPRIATELY AND ALSO CONSISTENTLY- IS THAT SOMETHING WHERE WE CAN GET TO THEM IN THE IN YOUR DISCUSSIONS IN THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS THE WELL WHAT WHAT WHERE WHERE IS THAT GOD IN RELATION TO THIS DEFINITION BETWEEN LET'S SEE YOURSELF AND- I THINK DISPLAY RIGHTS OF AN ORGANIZATION WHOSE RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT. I CAN KEEP WORKING ON THE DEFINITION WHO WOULD LIKE ME TO GO WELL I AM I WELL I THINK SO. RIGHT I SAID AT THAT. MEETING WITH THEM. SO I MEAN IS THAT IS I I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND LIKE IT'S- WHAT I ASSUME YOU'VE TALKED BEFORE ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THIS IS BEEN. THAT DOCTOR TOM INSULT. IN A PRESS GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S APPOINT POINTY TO THE MIDDLE L. L. A. U. APPY TO IT OKAY CAN DO BECAUSE OF THE ISSUE IS I GOT PEOPLE DYING ON THE STREETS. IT WELL AND BUT THE THING IS WE ALSO I MEAN WE NEED TO. I THINK WE NEED TO TRY TO COME TO A PLACE WHERE. WHERE BASICALLY YOU KNOW THE PROBLEM IS THAT YOU HAVE A DEFINITION THAT CITIZENS CONSISTENTLY ARE INAPPROPRIATELY THAT'S GONNA CAUSE ITS OWN PROBLEMS TOO SO I MEAN I GET SO WE WE'VE WITH THAT SO I'M HOPING THAT I WAS HOPING THAT ACTUALLY WHEN WE FIRST HEARD THE BILL THAT WE WOULDACTUALLY BE. MUCH FARTHER ALONG IN FIGURING OUT LIKE A AGREED UPON. APPROACH TO THE POT THIS POPULATION SO I DON'T KNOW IT WOULD HELP THEIR BEEN-CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN DISPLAY RIGHTS AND- OFFICE ABOUT THIS. WEEK WE HAVE NOT HAD ANY CONVERSATIONS- AND WE'RE A LITTLE SURPRISED TO SEE THE ACTUALLY THE AMENDMENT THAT ACTUALLY WENT THE WRONG DIRECTION- FOR US BY GIVING THE COUNTIES OPTIONS ON THIS. I THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE SENATOR ON THAT AND WHICH I. TRY TO. ARTICULATE WAS THAT. THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE THAT GETS RESOLVED WITH JUST A DEFINITION. THIS IS A BROADER ISSUE AS YOU ARE PERFECTLY AWARE- OF SERVICES OF HOUSING- AND AVAILABILITY AS MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED TO THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC GUARDIANS. TO PROVIDE TO YOU THESE SERVICES WHICH WE NOW OR ARE. WHOLLY LACKING- OUT THERE SO TWEAKING A DEFINITION. THAT JUST BRINGS MORE PEOPLE INTO A SYSTEM THAT WE THINK IS ILL EQUIPPED TO HANDLE THAT- IT IS NOT THE ANSWER IT NEEDS TO BE A COMPREHENSIVE DISCUSSION. I WOULD BE HOPEFUL THAT NOW AS THE- HAS PUT. HIS IS ALSO A AT LEAST AS WE'VE READ FOR TODAY AND SOME OF THIS BROADER DISCUSSION. THAT THERE IS A MORE COMPREHENSIVE KIND OF- OF DISCUSSION RIGHT. GREAT. DIGIT THERE WAS ALSO AN ADVISER TO REGIONAL QUESTIONS YEAH SO- I THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE ON WHERE WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS WERE RELUCTANT TO SUPPORT ANYTHING AND TELL THE AUDIT IS RELEASED- WE DON'T A- DEGREE THAT THIS EXACT DEFINITION ARE THAT WAY OF STRUCTURING IT WITH THE COUNTY OFTEN PROGRAM IS THE WAY TO GO- WE ALSO SEE AN ANGRY WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA THAT THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE UNDERNEATH A LOT OF THE RESOURCES- OF THE FACILITY TYPES AND THAT- THAT NEEDS A LOT OF WORK. A PUBLIC GUARDIANS I'M ARE SERIOUSLY UNDERSTAFFED TODAY IN OUR RECEIVE NO STATE OR FEDERAL FUNDING- BOARDING CARES OF THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES WHICH WE PLACE A LOT OF CONSERVATIVES TEND TO- IS WHOLLY INADEQUATE- THEY RECEIVE THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS A DAY. TO PROVIDE FOR ROOM BOARD AND CARE- THERE'S THE- MEDICAID BLACKED OUT ON I AM THE FACILITIES OVER THE SIZE OF SIXTEEN BADS AND WE DO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY AS THE STATE- TO APPLY FOR A FEDERAL I AM THE WAY FOR THIS YEAR AND WE DO APPRECIATE CENTER MAROC SUPPORT ON THAT. AND SO COUNTIES WE ARE VERY INTERESTED IN THAT BUT THOSE ARE THINGS THAT ARE UNDERNEATH THE LAW THAT ARE REALLY BUT- BENEFICIAL TO THE ENTIRE SYSTEM I HAVE- OUR- PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE DO SEE THAT ARE ON COMMUNITY BASED- FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS UNDER THE IMAGE ASIDE TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF CONSERVATORSHIP BETTER UTILIZED IN- ACROSS THE STATE WE HAVE COUNTY IS THAT- OVERSPEND ON. VERSUS OTHERS ON IT THEIR FSP PROGRAMS AND THEY ACTUALLY DO SEE A REDUCTION IN THE UTILIZATION OF CONSERVATORSHIP BUT THEM AT THE SAME POINT WE GETTING BY THE STATE BY- OVERSPENDING ON MASS STP PROGRAMS FIRST FATHER'S SO THERE'S- THERE'S A LOT OF COMPOUND. THINGS IT'S A VERY COMPLEX SYSTEM THAT IS OCCURRING AND THERE'S A LOT OF COMPLEXITY THAT WE DON'T SEE A SIMPLE DEFINITION CHANGE WOULD SOLVE THE ISSUES THAT WE SEE- OUT OF SOCIETY LEVEL. SOME BUT WE ARE HAPPY TO AND DINNER CONVERSATIONS OKAY. ALRIGHT YES SAYS EARLY BY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IT THIS IS JUST I THINK SOMETHING THAT PLAGUES ALL OF US AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT NOT ONE BILL IS GOING TO FIX AND I AGREE THAT IT'S A SOCIETAL ISSUE- WHEN PEOPLE SAY I THINK SENATOR MITCHELL WHEN YOU WENT TO UTAH AND- AND DID THAT TO SEE WHAT HOW THE HEAD OF THEIR HOMELESSNESS. AND THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT BECAUSE I THINK WHAT YOU BROUGHT BACK TO US IS THAT PEOPLE IN UTAH LOOK AT SOMEONE WHO'S ON THE STREET AS THEIR BROTHER OR THEIR SISTER AND WE DON'T DO THAT HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND I WOULD SAY IN MANY OTHER AREAS IN THIS COUNTRY SO HOW DO WE CHANGE PEOPLE'S PERSPECTIVE I KNOW WHEN I LOOK AT SOMEONE ON THE STREET I THINK BY THE GRACE OF GOD IT'S NOT ME OR MY FAMILY- AND MENTAL ILLNESS IS A HUGE ISSUE AND YOU'RE RIGHT WE FAILED MANY MANY YEARS AGO. AS A STATE- I WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU KEEP WORKING ON THIS BILL BECAUSE I KNOW YOU THINK THAT LANGUAGE IS A WEAK ARGUMENT BUT I HAVE TO DISAGREE I THINK THAT WORDS MATTER AND IF WE DON'T GET THE WORDING RIGHT WE COULD ACTUALLY BE IN A WORSE SITUATION THAN WERE IN- I'LL GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE OF WORRYING THAT DIDN'T GET US WHERE WE WANTED TO BE. A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO- RATE IT'S A IT WAS THE LANGUAGE WAS THEY SHOULD BE TESTED AND WE ENDED UP BEING IN A SITUATION OR RAPE KITS OF SET ON- SHELVES FOR YEARS AND THERE'S A HUGE BACKLOG THERE'S A NEW LAW NOW THAT SAYS RAPE KITS SHALL BE TESTED SO THAT WILL ELIMINATE ANY FUTURE CLUB BUT I THINK WORDS ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT SO I WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU KEEP WORKING THE BILL. I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS THREE AND WHAT THEY COME UP WITH BEFORE WE START MAKING DECISIONS. AND WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE FACTS. YOUR WORK ON IT I JUST KEEP. ON THE BILL DOES NOT GET OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY. YOU KEEP WORKING ON IT AND I ALSO HIGHLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO TALK TO OPPOSITION. BECAUSE I KNOW WHEN I HAVE BILLS AND THERE'S OPPOSITION I ALWAYS MEET WITH THEM BECAUSE SOMETIMES ACTION GOOD IDEAS. SO I THINK YOU FOR BEING SO CONCERNED THOUGH AND I AM JUST SORRY CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. OKAY ANY. OKAY SO THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED SIR MORE LIKE I. NOW I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING O THIS ISSUE FOR A LONG TIME I WAS HOPEFUL THAT BY THE TIME WE GOT HERE TODAY THAT THERE HAVE BEEN MORE PROGRESS. HI I AM CONCERNED FOR EXAMPLE THAT THAT THE DEFINITION ISSUE I MEAN IT'S NOT JUST WORDS THIS IS. A PROPOSED LAW IT'S A BILL WAS GONE IT WOULD BE LAWS IT PASSES THROUGH AND- AND- A PRE SHEET THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DRESS AND UNDRESS AN ISSUE THAT WEALL NEED TO ADDRESS SO HOW DO WE SURE WE HELP PEOPLE WHO NEED HELP. RIGHT WHO MAY BE ON THE STREETS AND SO FORTH SO I SHARE THAT WITH YOU AND I WANT TO TRY TO COME OF THE SOLUTION. MY CONCERN IS IT THIS TIME IS THAT- IT THAT WILL YOU KNOW AT THE END AND KNOW IT TOO. TO BE FAIR TO CENTER MORE LACK I MEAN I WANT TO SAY TO. THE OPPONENTS IS THAT BECAUSE AFTER I DO ALSO CHAIR THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE. I THINK IT'S A BIT MUCH TO EXPECT. CENTER MORE LIKE TO WRITE A BILL TO ENCOMPASS ALL THE THINGS THAT BEEN BROUGHT UP ABOUT THE WHOLE SYSTEM OKAY. RIGHT SO I THINK THAT THAT YOU KNOW I IT'S NOW I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN SOME WAY BUT IT. DOES NOT CAN BE THE SOLUTION TO EVERY SINGLE PIECE WE OFFER AND BILLS AND WE KNOW THAT IS THERE A CELL THAT I THINK A BIT IN A BIT OF A BURDEN- OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE DOUBLE THE POLICY COMMITTEE SO SOME OF THIS WOULD ACTUALLY BE APPROPRIATIONS HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST ETCETERA I MEAN DOESN'T NEED TO TOUCH ON THAT AND I THINK THAT IT'S A BIT MISSING SO I APPRECIATE YOU SAID YOU CAN LOOK AT THE SILLY SIDE BUT ALSO. THIS THE SIDE ABOUT IT WE'RE GOING TO CREATE A CATEGORY IN THE PEOPLE IN THAT CATEGORY WOULD PEOPLE GO INTO THAT CATEGORY- BASICALLY WE'RE GONNA SAY GOVERNMENT HAS CERTAIN POWERS OVER YOU. ADDITIONAL POWERS OVER YOU RIGHT AND- I DEBTS OSTENSIBLY FOR YOUR QUOTE YOUR OWN GOOD I GUESS I GUESS THAT'S WHAT- THIS IS A- DEBTS. NOW THAT'S THE RATIONALE BE THE POLICY RATIONALE OR THE REASON- AND- AND THEN SECONDARILY IN YOU POINTED OUT YOU KNOW BABY IT'S ALSO FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE COMMUNITY AS WELL- THAT AGAIN I WILL BE CAREFUL WE DON'T STIGMATIZE PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH AS- NECESSARY BE MORE DANGEROUS THAN OTHER PEOPLE. BUT SIDES ONE BE CAREFUL ABOUT THAT TOO BUT WE BUT BEFORE BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE A CATEGORY THAT NEEDS TO BE. WELL DEFINED BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEN IT GOES THE COURTS COURTS A DIFFERENT RULINGS DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATORS OUR BUREAUCRATS ARE MAKING DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS DIFFERENT BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. AND THEN WE'LL HAVE THIS WHOLE HODGE PODGE AND- WE SHOULD ACTUALLY LOOKED AT ALL THE DIFFERENT STATES AND LOOKED AT ALL THESE DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS AND DID THAT KIND OF BACKGROUND WORK. BUT I HOPE THAT ACTUALLY THAT THEN DOING THAT- KNEW THAT. I THINK IT SHOWS THE CHALLENGE OF SAYING WELL WE NEED TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING FOR CALIFORNIA THAT'S MORE WELL DEFINED THAT. COURTS AND MINISTRY EDITORS AND BOARDS COUNTIES AND EVEN THE STATE ITSELF. CAN BE MORE CAN CAN CAN CAN BE SURE THAT WERE DOING THE RIGHT THING AND THAT WERE. WERE WERE DOING THIS CONSISTENTLY BECAUSE- IT THE ANSWER ISN'T GOING TO. MEAN VARIATIONS IN REGIONS BUT IT'S NOT LIKE WELL IF YOU. HAPPEN TO BE IN THIS COUNTY YOUR TREE THIS WAY THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY AND THAT CAN. ON THE ELKS SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT OKAY. SO UNFORTUNATELY I AM NOT ABLE TO SUPPORT. THE BILL TODAY IN THIS FORM BECAUSE OF THAT- AND- A YOU KNOW I IT BUT I DO. HOPE THAT WE CAN WORK CONTINUE TO WORK I KNOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP WORKING ON IT- AT ONE TO HELP YOU- IF WE CAN FIND A WAY TO ADDRESS. THAT ISSUE IN A FUTURE PIECE OF LEGISLATION I DO THINK IT'S TOO FAR AWAY FROM WHERE OF HOPING IT WOULD BE- I ENCOURAGE YOU TO TALK NOT ONLY OF COURSE WITH DR INSEL OVER THE MINISTRATION BUT ALSO AT THIS OF THE RACE AND ONE. WE ALL DONE BILLS WE MAY NOT GET THE OPPOSITION MAY NOT KNOW SO YOU'D BE ALL ON BOARD AT LEAST WE'VE TRIED TO ADDRESS. THE IMPORTANT ISSUES AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S- I DON'T FEEL LIKE THERE'S BEEN ENOUGH PROGRESS MADE FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY- SO WITH THAT- WHICH ELECT CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I THANK YOU FOR RELEASED ALLOWING ME TO USE A LITTLE LEVITY AS- POOR AS IT WAS BECAUSE THIS IS AN EXTREMELY. SERIOUS SERIOUS SUBJECT AND- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE. CONSTITUENTS IN YOUR OFFICE AND- THEY INFORMED ME THAT THEY LOST THEIR SON. NO IT'S- YOU KNOW AND IT'S JUST SOMETHING YOU WANT TO WORK ON SO. RESEARCHER WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW DOESN'T SEEM TO BE WORKING. THE LETTERMAN PATRICK SHORT ACT YOU KNOW TO SAY THAT IT'S SUCCESSFUL. I WOULD JUST SAY GO OUTSIDE. GO TO SKID ROW IN LA. LOOK AT THE DATA IT'S NOT WORKING. WE A HAVE PEOPLE I'VE I'VE TOURED SOME INCREDIBLE STE ON THE SHELTERS- SAN ANTONIO'S HAVEN FOR HOPE. AND EVEN THERE THEY HAD TO SET UP A COURTYARD SO PEOPLE TO PUT UP THEIR TENTS THEY REFUSE TO GO INTO THE BUILDINGS AND SAID. NOT SLEEP IN THE COT. JUST HAD STEP TO OUR FACILITY IN THE YOLO CENTER AREA JUST LAST WEEK. SAME THING. YOU KNOW. MOST OF THE DAY ANT TO STAY IN THE BUILDINGS THERE. SO WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT WE NEED TO HELP AND YOU'VE- YOU'VE SEEN CAL MATTERS TO A RATHER EXHAUSTIVE. SERIES OF ARTICLES ON MENTAL HEALTH AND WHERE WE SHOULD BE GOING IN. I THINK THIS. THIS FALLS INTO WHERE WE SHOULD BE GOING I THINK THE DEFINITION IS FINE SO I APOLOGIZE FOR. QUESTION ABOUT IT I JUST. AYE AYE AYE. AYE RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE. I THINK THE DEFINITION IS FINE WE WORKED ON IT AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS OPTIONAL. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS OPTIONAL JUST LIKE LAWRENCE Là IS OPTIONAL. AND SO WITH THAT MISTER CHAIR- PEOPLE STILL HAVE PSYCHOTIC. EPISODES AND A SEVENTY TWO HOUR HOLD ISN'T GONNA CUT IT. IN YOUR POSITION SO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS ABOUT YOU KNOW OUR EMERGENCY ROOMS CAN HANDLE. THESE INDIVIDUALS AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE SPACE TO HOLD THEM FOR THREE OR FOUR FIVE DAYS SO. WE'VE GOT TO WORK IN CANADA DO EVERYTHING BECAUSE THIS AUDIT YEAH WHICH I SUPPORT. AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE RESULTS BUT IT'S AN APRIL. MINUTES PAST THE DEADLINE TO DO SOMETHING. FOR THIS YEAR AND WE'VE GOT TO BE WORKING TOGETHER FOR. THIS PRIVATE YOU KNOW THIS THIS ISSUE FOR THE PARENTS. ARE THESE PARENTS COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR KIDS ARE OVER EIGHTEEN THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING ANYMORE EVEN HIP ALLISER PREVENTING THEM TO A FROM FINDING WHAT THE DIAGNOSIS IS THE EVEN HELP THEIR KIDS. AND THEY CAN'T FILE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ORDERS THAT YOU KNOW WHAT THE SHERIFF BECAUSE AND THEY CAN'T TALK TO THEIR CHILD FOR TWO YEARS I MEAN IT'S JUST EVERYTHING IS. WHACKED AND YES I CAN'T DO A BILL THAT FIXES EVERYTHING. IN ONE SHOT BUT IF. HELPING PEOPLE WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS. GETTING BE A PROPER TREATMENT GETTING THEM OFF THE STREETS. I THINK THAT'S THE MAIN THING TO DO AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THIS BILL IS WORTH YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER.
