ONCE THE MORTGAGE IS GONE OUT

00:16:37.864 --> 00:16:41.067 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THIS.

00:16:39.732 --> 00:16:43.169 region:rollup2
MONEY COULD GO TO PEOPLE WHO

00:16:41.067 --> 00:16:45.505 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THOSE.

00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:47.206 region:rollup2
GUARANTEES AND I THINK WE WOULD

00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:49.008 region:rollup2
BE BETTER OFF SIMPLY PUTTING THE

00:16:47.206 --> 00:16:51.043 region:rollup2

WRITTEN IS THAT IT IT IT WILL GO

00:17:03.589 --> 00:17:06.492 region:rollup2
TOWARDS THE NONPROFIT THAT ARE.

WE HAVE EXAMPLES WHERE THESE

00:25:57.055 --> 00:25:59.658 region:rollup2

THAT IN ANY DISPUTE.

00:26:46.839 --> 00:26:48.740 region:rollup2
WITH THE COUNTY ASSESSOR THE

00:26:48.207 --> 00:26:51.543 region:rollup2
TAXPAYER HAS THE BURDEN OF

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:53.979 region:rollup2
PROOF.

THEY HAVE TO SHOW TWO THINGS.

ASSESSORS PROPERTY TAX

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:57.883 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT IS INCORRECT OR

00:26:55.113 --> 00:26:59.384 region:rollup2
WRONG.

00:26:57.883 --> 00:27:01.386 region:rollup2
THAT THE TAXPAYERS OPINION OF

00:26:59.384 --> 00:27:01.987 region:rollup2
THE FAIR MARKET VALUE IS CORRECT

00:27:01.386 --> 00:27:04.022 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THE SECOND ITEM THEY

WE'VE ACTUALLY CHANGE LETTERS.

00:27:32.384 --> 00:27:34.620 region:rollup2

00:27:45.164 --> 00:27:48.433 region:rollup2
THEREFORE THERE'S NO STATUTORY

THE TOPIC WAS DISCUSSED FOR OVER

00:27:56.708 --> 00:27:59.678 region:rollup2

00:29:27.366 --> 00:29:30.736 region:rollup2
OBSTACLE FACING MANY OF THESE

PROVIDES TWO RATHER SIMPLE BUT

00:29:43.949 --> 00:29:47.986 region:rollup2
HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THAT

00:29:45.684 --> 00:29:48.587 region:rollup2
WILL RESTRICT A TAXPAYERS RIGHT

00:29:47.986 --> 00:29:49.888 region:rollup2
TO A TIMELY ASSESSMENT APPEAL

00:29:48.587 --> 00:29:51.423 region:rollup2
HEARING.

00:29:49.888 --> 00:29:52.758 region:rollup2
THE FIRST AMENDMENT.

00:29:51.423 --> 00:29:54.726 region:rollup2
IT'S TO ADD LANGUAGE UNDER

00:29:52.758 --> 00:29:56.928 region:rollup2
SECTION FOUR FORTY ONE D. THAT

00:29:54.726 --> 00:29:58.263 region:rollup2
WOULD NOW REQUIRE AN APPLICANT

ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION.

00:30:02.734 --> 00:30:05.337 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH MANY APPLICANTS DO SO

00:30:04.369 --> 00:30:07.005 region:rollup2
AND IT'S IN THEIR BEST INTEREST

00:30:05.337 --> 00:30:09.241 region:rollup2
TO DO SO IN ORDER TO RECEIVE A

00:30:07.005 --> 00:30:11.209 region:rollup2
REDUCTION THERE IS NO SUCH

00:30:09.241 --> 00:30:12.577 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT THAT EXISTS TODAY.

00:30:11.209 --> 00:30:14.313 region:rollup2
THE SECOND AMENDMENT TO SECTION

00:30:12.577 --> 00:30:16.014 region:rollup2
FOUR SEVENTY SIX TO STRIKE THE

00:30:14.313 --> 00:30:17.716 region:rollup2

AT FIRST GLANCE THESE CHANGES

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:27.693 region:rollup2
MAY APPEAR TO BE MINOR AND VERY

00:30:26.191 --> 00:30:29.428 region:rollup2
REASONABLE.

00:30:27.693 --> 00:30:30.495 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THESE TWO CHANGES

00:30:29.428 --> 00:30:32.531 region:rollup2
STRATEGICALLY CHANGE THE

00:30:30.495 --> 00:30:34.299 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT THAT TAXPAYERS

00:30:32.531 --> 00:30:35.701 region:rollup2

TIMELY HEARING ON THE VALUATION

00:30:35.701 --> 00:30:39.371 region:rollup2
OF THE PROPERTY.

00:30:37.636 --> 00:30:41.173 region:rollup2
THE AMENDMENT ALTERS THE

THE ACCESS TO A HEARING.

00:37:30.348 --> 00:37:34.586 region:rollup2

HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION THEY

00:37:36.855 --> 00:37:39.758 region:rollup2
BECOME NON COMPLIANT.

00:37:38.723 --> 00:37:41.025 region:rollup2
IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY THEY

00:37:39.758 --> 00:37:42.660 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAVE AN AGENDA OF

00:37:41.025 --> 00:37:44.629 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE AND NONCOMPLIANCE

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:46.164 region:rollup2
TAXPAYERS SO TAX MAYOR HAVE TO

00:37:44.629 --> 00:37:48.099 region:rollup2
MAY HAVE TO COME BACK TO THREE

00:37:46.164 --> 00:37:49.701 region:rollup2

PROVIDE ALL THE INFORMATION

00:37:49.701 --> 00:37:53.271 region:rollup2
REQUIRED FROM AN ASSESSOR JUST

00:37:51.736 --> 00:37:55.406 region:rollup2
TO GET EVALUATION HEARING.

00:37:53.271 --> 00:37:56.174 region:rollup2
THAT IS NOT DUE PROCESS AND MANY

00:37:55.406 --> 00:37:57.575 region:rollup2
OF OUR CLIENTS HAVE SIMPLY GIVEN

00:37:56.174 --> 00:37:59.177 region:rollup2
UP

00:37:57.575 --> 00:38:00.912 region:rollup2
I GIVE YOU A BRIEF EXAMPLE WE

00:37:59.177 --> 00:38:02.814 region:rollup2
RECENTLY HAD A REQUEST. FOR

00:38:00.912 --> 00:38:05.116 region:rollup2
INFORMATION WE PROVIDED I THINK

00:38:02.814 --> 00:38:06.751 region:rollup2
FOUR OF THE SIX ITEMS ON THE ON

00:38:05.116 --> 00:38:08.453 region:rollup2
THE REQUEST WE WERE STILL TOLD

00:38:06.751 --> 00:38:09.721 region:rollup2
WE WERE NON COMPLIANT.

00:38:08.453 --> 00:38:10.755 region:rollup2
NOW YOU HAVE MUST COME BACK FROM

00:38:09.721 --> 00:38:12.157 region:rollup2

YOU'LL BE DENIED.

00:38:12.157 --> 00:38:14.359 region:rollup2
SO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING SMALL

00:38:13.258 --> 00:38:16.327 region:rollup2
BUSINESS OWNERS IF THEY HAVE TO

00:38:14.359 --> 00:38:17.662 region:rollup2
SHOW UP TWO AND THREE FOUR TIMES

00:38:16.327 --> 00:38:19.697 region:rollup2
FOR HEARINGS JUST TO DETERMINE

00:38:17.662 --> 00:38:21.499 region:rollup2
IF THEY'RE COMPLIANT BEFORE THEY

00:38:19.697 --> 00:38:23.268 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GET EVALUATION HEARING.

00:38:21.499 --> 00:38:24.869 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GONNA SEE APPEALS GO TO

00:38:23.268 --> 00:38:26.137 region:rollup2
NOTHING AND A LOT OF UNHAPPY

00:38:24.869 --> 00:38:28.406 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO LOSE DUE

00:38:26.137 --> 00:38:29.941 region:rollup2
PROCESS TO GET THEIR VALUE HURT

00:38:28.406 --> 00:38:30.909 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT THE WAY IT'S WORKED

00:38:29.941 --> 00:38:32.243 region:rollup2
FOR THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS

00:38:30.909 --> 00:38:34.179 region:rollup2
THAT I'VE BEEN PRACTICING.

00:38:32.243 --> 00:38:35.446 region:rollup2
BUT FROM NOT NOT MUCH DIFFERENT

00:38:34.179 --> 00:38:36.981 region:rollup2
THAN WHEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLIN

00:38:35.446 --> 00:38:38.349 region:rollup2
SAYS THAT SOUNDS LIKE A SYSTEMIC

00:38:36.981 --> 00:38:39.651 region:rollup2
PROBLEM NOT A PROBLEM ABOUT HOW

00:38:38.349 --> 00:38:40.885 region:rollup2
THAT INFORMATION HAS BEEN

00:38:39.651 --> 00:38:42.420 region:rollup2
DELIVER FOR THE LAST TWENTY FIVE

00:38:40.885 --> 00:38:44.122 region:rollup2
YEARS SO RIGHT NOW IT'S BEING

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:45.390 region:rollup2
DELIVERED EITHER IN PERSON OR.

00:38:44.122 --> 00:38:47.358 region:rollup2
VIA MAIL THIS IS SAYING TWO

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:48.726 region:rollup2
THINGS TO YOUR. POINT

00:38:47.358 --> 00:38:50.161 region:rollup2
THIS IS SAYING TWO THINGS TO BE

00:38:48.726 --> 00:38:51.162 region:rollup2
CLEAR WRITE THAT DOWN NOW THOSE

00:38:50.161 --> 00:38:53.131 region:rollup2
THAT INFORMATION CAN BE

00:38:51.162 --> 00:38:54.399 region:rollup2
DELIVERED ELECTRONICALLY. NOW IF

00:38:53.131 --> 00:38:56.134 region:rollup2
YOU CAN GET THE INFORMATION BACK

00:38:54.399 --> 00:38:57.902 region:rollup2
THIS DOESN'T CHANGE THAT. THAT'S

00:38:56.134 --> 00:38:59.904 region:rollup2
WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW THE OTHER

00:38:57.902 --> 00:39:00.371 region:rollup2
THING IS THIS IS RECIPROCAL SO

00:38:59.904 --> 00:39:01.272 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU SAY THAT THE.

00:39:00.371 --> 00:39:03.174 region:rollup2
.

00:39:01.272 --> 00:39:04.475 region:rollup2
THAT THE CUSTOMER THE CLIENT

00:39:03.174 --> 00:39:05.643 region:rollup2
CANNOT GET THE INFORMATION THIS

00:39:04.475 --> 00:39:07.345 region:rollup2
IS RECIPROCAL SO IT GOES TO THE

00:39:05.643 --> 00:39:09.847 region:rollup2
ASSESSOR AND IT CAN COME BACK AS

00:39:07.345 --> 00:39:10.815 region:rollup2
WELL SO. I THINK WHAT YOUR WILL

00:39:09.847 --> 00:39:12.217 region:rollup2
MY IMPRESSION OF WHAT YOU'RE

00:39:10.815 --> 00:39:13.117 region:rollup2
SAYING IN MY UNDERSTANDING OF

00:39:12.217 --> 00:39:14.619 region:rollup2
THE BILL THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN

00:39:13.117 --> 00:39:16.254 region:rollup2
FROM COMMITTEE STAFF AND FOR MY

00:39:14.619 --> 00:39:18.022 region:rollup2
OWN REVIEW IS THAT. WHAT YOU'RE

00:39:16.254 --> 00:39:19.490 region:rollup2
DISCUSSING IS A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM

00:39:18.022 --> 00:39:21.025 region:rollup2
NOT A PROBLEM WITH THIS ACTUAL

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:22.760 region:rollup2
BILL ON THE ROUTE ON THE ABILITY

00:39:21.025 --> 00:39:25.163 region:rollup2
TO DELIVER THE THOSE DOCUMENTS

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:26.564 region:rollup2
VIA ELECTRONIC DELIVERY SYSTEM

00:39:25.163 --> 00:39:28.366 region:rollup2
THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY BEING

00:39:26.564 --> 00:39:30.034 region:rollup2
BROUGHT UP AFTER KATO BRACED OUR

00:39:28.366 --> 00:39:32.403 region:rollup2
CONCERNS? HERE'S THE MAJOR

00:39:30.034 --> 00:39:33.771 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL THE WORD

THE ASSESSOR COMES UP WITH

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:43.982 region:rollup2
BEFORE THEIR RIGHT TO A HEARING.

00:39:41.713 --> 00:39:46.317 region:rollup2
TO PROCESS IS BEING DENIED.

00:39:43.982 --> 00:39:47.885 region:rollup2
MOST OF THE INFORMATION WE

ALREADY PROVIDE ELECTRONICALLY.

00:39:47.885 --> 00:39:50.622 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE WE ALMOST

00:39:49.487 --> 00:39:52.056 region:rollup2
PROVIDE ALL THE TIME THE

00:39:50.622 --> 00:39:54.092 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ELECTRONICALLY AND

TO BE FAIR TO SANTA CLARA COUNTY

00:39:54.092 --> 00:39:57.362 region:rollup2
WE WORK OUT MOST ASSESSMENTS.

00:39:55.827 --> 00:39:59.497 region:rollup2
WE'RE HERE TALKING ABOUT THE

00:39:57.362 --> 00:40:01.532 region:rollup2
RIGHTS OF A TAXPAYER AND IF YOU

00:39:59.497 --> 00:40:02.033 region:rollup2
MAKE THIS REQUIREMENT WHICH

00:40:01.532 --> 00:40:03.268 region:rollup2
ISN'T THERE NOW THAT THE

ASSESSOR.

00:40:03.268 --> 00:40:06.504 region:rollup2
KING ASKED FOR WHATEVER THEY

00:40:04.435 --> 00:40:07.872 region:rollup2
WANT AND THEN THE APPEAL CAN BE

00:40:06.504 --> 00:40:09.007 region:rollup2
PUT OFF BY THE APPEALS BOARD.

00:40:07.872 --> 00:40:09.641 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO SEE

00:40:09.007 --> 00:40:11.175 region:rollup2
A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WITHDRAW FROM

00:40:09.641 --> 00:40:12.877 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS.

00:40:11.175 --> 00:40:14.412 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE IS THOUGH IS THAT

00:40:12.877 --> 00:40:15.813 region:rollup2

THINGS CAN BE DELIVERED NOW I

00:40:18.683 --> 00:40:22.754 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S WHERE. WHERE I AM I

00:40:21.152 --> 00:40:24.022 region:rollup2
NOT GETTING IT YOU CAN STILL

ABILITY TO VIEW DOCUMENTS ON

00:40:26.391 --> 00:40:29.494 region:rollup2
SITE? THAT IS STILL POSSIBLE SO

00:40:28.593 --> 00:40:31.195 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:40:29.494 --> 00:40:32.930 region:rollup2
NOTHING IN THE LIVER DOCUMENTS

00:40:31.195 --> 00:40:33.531 region:rollup2

ELECTRONIC DELIVERY OF THOSE

00:40:36.301 --> 00:40:39.337 region:rollup2
DOES NOT CHANGED THAT IT DOESN'T

00:40:38.236 --> 00:40:41.139 region:rollup2
CHANGE AYE DOESN'T SOLVE YOUR

00:40:39.337 --> 00:40:42.440 region:rollup2
PROBLEM I GET THAT. BUT IT

00:40:41.139 --> 00:40:44.142 region:rollup2
DOESN'T CREATE AN ADDITIONAL

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:45.943 region:rollup2
PROBLEM IT ACTUALLY MAKES IT

00:40:44.142 --> 00:40:47.378 region:rollup2
HOPEFUL I WOULD IMAGINE MORE

00:40:45.943 --> 00:40:49.347 region:rollup2
EFFICIENT BECAUSE THEY CAN BE

00:40:47.378 --> 00:40:52.317 region:rollup2
DELIVERED. IN BOTH DIRECTIONS

00:40:49.347 --> 00:40:53.885 region:rollup2

ON THE COMMITTEE HAS A QUESTION

00:40:54.686 --> 00:40:57.689 region:rollup2
HOLD ON ANYONE ELSE ON THE

00:40:56.254 --> 00:41:00.058 region:rollup2

THE OPPOSITION HAS A MOVE

00:41:10.335 --> 00:41:14.372 region:rollup2
FORWARD IN THE PROCESS. SO SO WE

00:41:11.936 --> 00:41:15.606 region:rollup2
HAVE WORKED A LOT WITH WITH THE

00:41:14.372 --> 00:41:16.574 region:rollup2
OPPONENTS KEITA IN THEIR

ADVOCATES IN AND I'M GRATEFUL

00:41:16.574 --> 00:41:18.910 region:rollup2
FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY AND I THINK

00:41:17.842 --> 00:41:20.712 region:rollup2
THE CHANGES THAT WE'VE MADE TO

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:22.747 region:rollup2
MAKE THIS RECIPROCAL HAS MADE

00:41:20.712 --> 00:41:24.015 region:rollup2

BECAUSE WE SAY IF AVAILABLE.

00:41:30.822 --> 00:41:34.792 region:rollup2
AND SO WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR FOR

00:41:33.458 --> 00:41:36.060 region:rollup2
TAXPAYERS HAD TO PROVIDE

00:41:34.792 --> 00:41:37.595 region:rollup2
ANYTHING THAT THEY DON'T ALREADY

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:39.063 region:rollup2
HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE

00:41:37.595 --> 00:41:41.432 region:rollup2
ELECTRONICALLY BOTH.

00:41:39.063 --> 00:41:43.434 region:rollup2

ARE POWERED BY HYDROGEN.

00:44:31.669 --> 00:44:34.238 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE LARGEST

STATE MY COMPANY WOULD NOT EXIST

00:45:50.414 --> 00:45:52.783 region:rollup2
WHERE MORE FOR WHO IF IT WEREN'T

00:45:51.616 --> 00:45:54.518 region:rollup2
FOR THESE.

00:45:52.783 --> 00:45:55.920 region:rollup2
THE POLICIES OF CALIFORNIA. A

00:45:54.518 --> 00:45:57.521 region:rollup2
TO DATE WE'VE BUILT NINETEEN

00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:58.022 region:rollup2
HYDROGEN STATIONS IN THE STATE

00:45:57.521 --> 00:45:59.957 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TWELVE OR UNDER

00:45:58.022 --> 00:46:01.459 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT WE'VE COMPLETED OVER

00:45:59.957 --> 00:46:03.427 region:rollup2
A HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND

00:46:01.459 --> 00:46:05.396 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL FILLS OF RETAIL FUEL

00:46:03.427 --> 00:46:06.097 region:rollup2
CELL CARS IN THE HANDS. OF

00:46:05.396 --> 00:46:07.331 region:rollup2
CUSTOMERS.

00:46:06.097 --> 00:46:08.899 region:rollup2
AND WE ESTIMATE THAT WE'VE

00:46:07.331 --> 00:46:10.334 region:rollup2
AVOIDED NEARLY TWENTY MILLION

00:46:08.899 --> 00:46:12.169 region:rollup2
POUNDS OF CO TWO EMISSIONS AS A

00:46:10.334 --> 00:46:13.804 region:rollup2
RESULT OF THOSE FILMS.

00:46:12.169 --> 00:46:14.905 region:rollup2
TO PUT THAT INTO CONTEXT THAT'S

00:46:13.804 --> 00:46:16.607 region:rollup2
THE EQUIVALENT OF PLANTING A

00:46:14.905 --> 00:46:18.442 region:rollup2
FOREST SEVENTY FIVE TIMES THE

00:46:16.607 --> 00:46:19.844 region:rollup2
SIZE OF DISNEYLAND.

00:46:18.442 --> 00:46:21.412 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE PROUD OF OF.

00:46:19.844 --> 00:46:22.813 region:rollup2
THE START THAT WE'VE GOT AND

00:46:21.412 --> 00:46:24.982 region:rollup2
WE'RE OFF TO A GOOD START WITH

00:46:22.813 --> 00:46:26.684 region:rollup2
ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND. FUEL CELL

00:46:24.982 --> 00:46:27.885 region:rollup2
CARS ON THE ROAD IN CALIFORNIA.

00:46:26.684 --> 00:46:29.987 region:rollup2
BUT WE NEED TO TRANSITION OUT

00:46:27.885 --> 00:46:31.088 region:rollup2
EARLY COMMERCIAL SCALE AND WHILE

00:46:29.987 --> 00:46:32.890 region:rollup2
WERE HAVING SOME EARLY SUCCESS

00:46:31.088 --> 00:46:34.425 region:rollup2
THERE ARE MANY CHALLENGES THAT

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:35.693 region:rollup2
WE STILL FACE AND IT'S NOT A. A

00:46:34.425 --> 00:46:36.661 region:rollup2
SILVER BULLET THAT'S GOING TO BE

00:46:35.693 --> 00:46:37.895 region:rollup2
A SOLUTION IT'S REALLY THE

00:46:36.661 --> 00:46:39.497 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE SET OF POLICIES IN

00:46:37.895 --> 00:46:41.198 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:46:39.497 --> 00:46:42.366 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THIS EXEMPTION WOULD

00:46:41.198 --> 00:46:43.934 region:rollup2
BE CONSISTENT WITH THE

00:46:42.366 --> 00:46:45.870 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SUPPORT OF ZEV

00:46:43.934 --> 00:46:47.071 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES OTHER ARE TO USE OF

00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:48.072 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES PLUG IN VEHICLES

00:46:47.071 --> 00:46:49.373 region:rollup2
AND HYDROGEN.

00:46:48.072 --> 00:46:51.375 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD PUT THEM ON PARITY

00:46:49.373 --> 00:46:53.210 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF HOW THE CONSUMERS OF

00:46:51.375 --> 00:46:54.445 region:rollup2
THOSE VEHICLES ARE TAXED.

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:55.746 region:rollup2
AND WOULD ALSO ADDRESS EIGHT

00:46:54.445 --> 00:46:57.515 region:rollup2
NEAR TERM CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE

00:46:55.746 --> 00:46:59.116 region:rollup2
OF A HIGHER PRICE OF HYDROGEN AT

00:46:57.515 --> 00:47:00.851 region:rollup2
THE PUMP TODAY COMPARED TO

00:46:59.116 --> 00:47:03.154 region:rollup2
GASOLINE IN CONVENTIONAL FUELS.

00:47:00.851 --> 00:47:04.588 region:rollup2
SO WE WANT TO PASS A LOWER COST

00:47:03.154 --> 00:47:05.823 region:rollup2
ON TO THE CONSUMER AT THE PUMP.

00:47:04.588 --> 00:47:06.891 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ONE OF THE BIGGEST

00:47:05.823 --> 00:47:08.893 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS THAT WE HEAR FROM OUR

00:47:06.891 --> 00:47:09.994 region:rollup2
CUSTOMERS ARE WELL WHEN IS THE

00:47:08.893 --> 00:47:11.662 region:rollup2
PRICE GOING TO COME DOWN WHAT

00:47:09.994 --> 00:47:12.663 region:rollup2
HAPPENS WHEN MY LEASE RUNS OUT.

00:47:11.662 --> 00:47:13.998 region:rollup2
I'M THINKING OF BUYING THIS

00:47:12.663 --> 00:47:15.199 region:rollup2
VEHICLE RATHER THAN LEASING IT

00:47:13.998 --> 00:47:17.134 region:rollup2
BUT AS THE PRICE OF HYDROGEN

00:47:15.199 --> 00:47:18.069 region:rollup2
GONNA STAY HIGH. WE BELIEVE THIS

00:47:17.134 --> 00:47:20.037 region:rollup2
WILL HELP STIMULATE.

00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:21.272 region:rollup2
THE ZEV THIS HAVE CUSTOMER IN

00:47:20.037 --> 00:47:22.807 region:rollup2
THE GROWTH OF SOBS.

00:47:21.272 --> 00:47:24.575 region:rollup2
I'M FINE I JUST WANT TO CLOSE BY

00:47:22.807 --> 00:47:25.843 region:rollup2
SAYING THAT AS WE ACHIEVE EARLY

00:47:24.575 --> 00:47:27.778 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL SCALE AND WE THINK

00:47:25.843 --> 00:47:29.180 region:rollup2
WE'LL BE ABLE TO DO THAT IN THE

00:47:27.778 --> 00:47:30.948 region:rollup2
TEN YEAR TIME FRAME.

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:32.516 region:rollup2
WE CERTAINLY WANT TO COME BACK

00:47:30.948 --> 00:47:34.285 region:rollup2
AND THINK ABOUT HOW ZERO

00:47:32.516 --> 00:47:35.553 region:rollup2
EMISSION VEHICLES THAT AND THE

00:47:34.285 --> 00:47:37.221 region:rollup2
FUELING OF THEM SHOULD BE

00:47:35.553 --> 00:47:37.922 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATELY TAX.

00:47:37.221 --> 00:47:38.689 region:rollup2
AND.

00:47:37.922 --> 00:47:40.858 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY WE'VE.

00:47:38.689 --> 00:47:41.926 region:rollup2
I RECOMMENDED SUNSET DATE I

00:47:40.858 --> 00:47:43.227 region:rollup2
THINK YOU GUYS BROUGHT THAT DOWN

00:47:41.926 --> 00:47:44.662 region:rollup2
WILL BE TO FIVE YEARS WERE

00:47:43.227 --> 00:47:46.731 region:rollup2

COMMITTED TO DOING OUR PART TO

00:48:05.249 --> 00:48:08.652 region:rollup2
HELP ME CALIFORNIA'S AMBITIOUS

00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:09.220 region:rollup2
AND IMPORTANT GREENHOUSE GAS

00:48:08.652 --> 00:48:10.755 region:rollup2
EMISSION AND CLIMATE CHANGE

GOALS.

00:48:10.755 --> 00:48:13.190 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION TO OFFERING PLUG IN

00:48:12.356 --> 00:48:14.992 region:rollup2
HYBRIDS AND BATTERY BUDGET

00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:16.394 region:rollup2
VEHICLES WE ARE ALSO PROUD TO

00:48:14.992 --> 00:48:17.528 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN FIRST TO THE MARKET

00:48:16.394 --> 00:48:19.697 region:rollup2
WITH ARE FUEL CELL ELECTRIC

00:48:17.528 --> 00:48:21.399 region:rollup2
VEHICLE THE MERE AYE.

00:48:19.697 --> 00:48:22.600 region:rollup2
FC VIS OUR FRIEND EXCELLENT

00:48:21.399 --> 00:48:23.968 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE TO GASOLINE POWERED

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:25.536 region:rollup2
CARS AND ARE MORE CLOSELY

00:48:23.968 --> 00:48:26.837 region:rollup2
MATCHING THE U. S. MASS MARKET

00:48:25.536 --> 00:48:28.439 region:rollup2
NEEDS FOR VEHICLES THAT CAN BE

00:48:26.837 --> 00:48:30.040 region:rollup2
REFUELED QUICKLY. AND DRIVING

00:48:28.439 --> 00:48:31.675 region:rollup2
LONG DISTANCES.

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:33.711 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE THE MERE I CAN HAS A

00:48:31.675 --> 00:48:34.345 region:rollup2
RANGE OF THREE OR TWELVE MILES

00:48:33.711 --> 00:48:36.080 region:rollup2
AND CAN BE REFILLED IN A MATTER

00:48:34.345 --> 00:48:37.181 region:rollup2
OF MINUTES.

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:38.349 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WILL

00:48:37.181 --> 00:48:40.017 region:rollup2
HELP ACCELERATE SEVEN OPTION IN

00:48:38.349 --> 00:48:41.519 region:rollup2
TWO WAYS.

00:48:40.017 --> 00:48:42.887 region:rollup2
THE FIRST IS THAT IT WILL HELP

00:48:41.519 --> 00:48:44.421 region:rollup2
TO REDUCE THE COST OF RETAIL

00:48:42.887 --> 00:48:45.790 region:rollup2
HYDROGENS THE CONSUMER DURING

00:48:44.421 --> 00:48:47.725 region:rollup2
THE EARLY MARKET INTRODUCTION

00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:49.160 region:rollup2
YEARS. ONE RETAIL HYDROGEN COSTS

00:48:47.725 --> 00:48:50.428 region:rollup2
ARE ON NATURALLY HIGHER THAN

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:52.129 region:rollup2
THEY WILL BE IN A FULLY

00:48:50.428 --> 00:48:53.564 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED MARKET.

00:48:52.129 --> 00:48:54.565 region:rollup2
REDUCING THE CONSUMERS COST OF

00:48:53.564 --> 00:48:57.835 region:rollup2
OWNERSHIP WILL HELP TO

00:48:54.565 --> 00:48:59.370 region:rollup2
ACCELERATE THIS ADOPTION.

00:48:57.835 --> 00:49:01.272 region:rollup2
SECOND IT WILL CREATE PARITY

00:48:59.370 --> 00:49:03.007 region:rollup2
BETWEEN TWO THAT TECHNOLOGIES IN

00:49:01.272 --> 00:49:04.141 region:rollup2
THE MARKETPLACE TODAY. PLUGIN

00:49:03.007 --> 00:49:05.509 region:rollup2
BATTERIES SECOND ZERO EMISSION

00:49:04.141 --> 00:49:06.911 region:rollup2
VEHICLES AND HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS

00:49:05.509 --> 00:49:08.179 region:rollup2
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES.

00:49:06.911 --> 00:49:09.780 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY THE LOCK COMPLETELY

00:49:08.179 --> 00:49:11.282 region:rollup2
EXEMPTS ELECTRICITY FROM THE

00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:12.550 region:rollup2
STATE AND LOCAL SALES AND USE

00:49:11.282 --> 00:49:14.452 region:rollup2
TAX FOR PLUG IN BATTERY

00:49:12.550 --> 00:49:16.487 region:rollup2
ELECTRICS. WHILE RETAIL HYDROGEN

00:49:14.452 --> 00:49:17.054 region:rollup2
FUEL CELLS UNFAIRLY REMAIN

00:49:16.487 --> 00:49:18.322 region:rollup2
SUBJECT TO THE SALES AND USE

00:49:17.054 --> 00:49:19.690 region:rollup2
TAX.

00:49:18.322 --> 00:49:21.192 region:rollup2
AB THREE THOUSAND WILL REMEDY

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:22.526 region:rollup2
THIS INCONSISTENT TREATMENT OF

00:49:21.192 --> 00:49:24.929 region:rollup2
FUELS FOR THESE TWO ELECTRIC

00:49:22.526 --> 00:49:26.330 region:rollup2
VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES.

00:49:24.929 --> 00:49:28.065 region:rollup2
IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE EMPLOY A

00:49:26.330 --> 00:49:29.166 region:rollup2
WIDE RANGE OF NEAR TERM TOOLS TO

00:49:28.065 --> 00:49:31.101 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE AND ACCELERATE

00:49:29.166 --> 00:49:31.902 region:rollup2
CONSUMER ADOPTION IF WE ARE TO

00:49:31.101 --> 00:49:33.137 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE ARE IMPORTANT

00:49:31.902 --> 00:49:34.905 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR CLIMATE

00:49:33.137 --> 00:49:36.340 region:rollup2
CHANGE SCHOOLS.

00:49:34.905 --> 00:49:37.908 region:rollup2
INDEED THEY ARE RESOURCES BOARD

00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:39.443 region:rollup2
HAS REPEATEDLY MADE CLEAR THAT

00:49:37.908 --> 00:49:40.778 region:rollup2
WE CANNOT ME ARM ABILITY TRAMPS

00:49:39.443 --> 00:49:42.546 region:rollup2
ARE MOBILE TRANSPORTATION

00:49:40.778 --> 00:49:44.348 region:rollup2
EMISSION REDUCTION GOALS WITHOUT

00:49:42.546 --> 00:49:45.216 region:rollup2
HYDROGEN FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY.

00:49:44.348 --> 00:49:47.017 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS OTHERS THAT

00:49:45.216 --> 00:49:48.252 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES.

00:49:47.017 --> 00:49:50.187 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

00:49:48.252 --> 00:49:52.022 region:rollup2
AB THREE THOUSAND WILL SIMPLY

00:49:50.187 --> 00:49:53.257 region:rollup2
ENSURE PARITY BETWEEN THE

00:49:52.022 --> 00:49:54.925 region:rollup2
TAXATION OF HYDROGEN AND

00:49:53.257 --> 00:49:56.360 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY ONE SOLD AS A

00:49:54.925 --> 00:49:57.828 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION FUEL FOR ZAPS.

00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:59.864 region:rollup2
AND IN DOING SO CONSUMER

00:49:57.828 --> 00:50:00.364 region:rollup2
PURCHASING FUEL CELL ELECTRIC

00:49:59.864 --> 00:50:01.699 region:rollup2
VEHICLES WILL BE TREATED

00:50:00.364 --> 00:50:02.766 region:rollup2
EQUALLY.

00:50:01.699 --> 00:50:04.034 region:rollup2
AND THE TEMPORARY REDUCTION IN

00:50:02.766 --> 00:50:06.070 region:rollup2
THE COST OF HYDROGEN WILL

00:50:04.034 --> 00:50:07.605 region:rollup2
ACCELERATE CONSUMER TRANSITION

00:50:06.070 --> 00:50:08.672 region:rollup2
INTO OF CVS.

00:50:07.605 --> 00:50:10.307 region:rollup2

TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION WE

00:51:11.835 --> 00:51:14.271 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T TAKEN A POSITION ON THIS

00:51:13.137 --> 00:51:16.440 region:rollup2
BILL YET.

00:51:14.271 --> 00:51:17.541 region:rollup2
A WOULD MENTION THAT THERE ARE

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:19.343 region:rollup2
A NUMBER OF BILLS LIKE THIS THAT

00:51:17.541 --> 00:51:21.278 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED OVER TIME

00:51:19.343 --> 00:51:21.979 region:rollup2
AND AND PERHAPS MAYBE. NOW

00:51:21.278 --> 00:51:23.447 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY.

00:51:21.979 --> 00:51:25.516 region:rollup2
I'VE I THINK MR PEROT HAD

00:51:23.447 --> 00:51:26.216 region:rollup2
UMBILICAL YEARS BACK REVISING

00:51:25.516 --> 00:51:28.986 region:rollup2
ONE THAT WAS.

00:51:26.216 --> 00:51:30.087 region:rollup2
CREATED THE YEAR OF MY BIRTH SO

00:51:28.986 --> 00:51:31.622 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A LOT OF THESE MEASURES

00:51:30.087 --> 00:51:33.357 region:rollup2
BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE REALLY

00:51:31.622 --> 00:51:34.692 region:rollup2
STARTED CONSIDERING.

00:51:33.357 --> 00:51:36.060 region:rollup2
PUTTING SUNSET DATES AND SORT

00:51:34.692 --> 00:51:37.161 region:rollup2
OF MANDATING SUNSET DATES ON

00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:38.796 region:rollup2
THESE ITEMS AND SO THERE'S A

00:51:37.161 --> 00:51:40.864 region:rollup2
SLEW OF ITEMS INTENDED TO

00:51:38.796 --> 00:51:42.099 region:rollup2
INCENTIVIZE. VARIOUS FUELS AND

00:51:40.864 --> 00:51:44.034 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE REALLY

00:51:42.099 --> 00:51:45.069 region:rollup2
VERY OUTDATED AT THIS POINT AND

00:51:44.034 --> 00:51:46.370 region:rollup2
YOU MIGHT CONSIDER LOOKING AT

00:51:45.069 --> 00:51:48.172 region:rollup2
SOME OF THOSE AS A WAY TO OFFSET

00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:50.908 region:rollup2
THE COSTS IN THIS MEASURE. THANK

00:51:48.172 --> 00:51:52.309 region:rollup2

WELL AND LOOK AT HIM.

00:51:57.014 --> 00:52:00.784 region:rollup2
JUST THAT CPAS GENERAL QUESTION

00:51:58.882 --> 00:52:00.985 region:rollup2
I SUPPORT THIS I THINK WE NEED

00:52:00.784 --> 00:52:02.386 region:rollup2
MORE.

00:52:00.985 --> 00:52:02.753 region:rollup2
.

00:52:02.386 --> 00:52:04.088 region:rollup2
WHEN WE DO THAT.

00:52:02.753 --> 00:52:05.923 region:rollup2
.

00:52:04.088 --> 00:52:07.591 region:rollup2
MORE POLICIES IN CALIFORNIA TO

00:52:05.923 --> 00:52:09.193 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON SAID VEHICLES IT'S ONLY

00:52:07.591 --> 00:52:10.260 region:rollup2
ONE POINT FORWARD IT TO TWO

00:52:09.193 --> 00:52:12.062 region:rollup2
MILLION AND I GUESS THERE'S

00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:14.231 region:rollup2
THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND THEIR

00:52:12.062 --> 00:52:17.201 region:rollup2
VEHICLES. PER THIS ANALYSIS OF

00:52:14.231 --> 00:52:19.003 region:rollup2
HOW MANY FUEL. HYDROGEN FUEL.

00:52:17.201 --> 00:52:21.171 region:rollup2
VEHICLES TO HAVE HERE COMPARED

00:52:19.003 --> 00:52:22.773 region:rollup2
TO. LET'S SAY YOU KNOW NON HUGS

00:52:21.171 --> 00:52:23.707 region:rollup2
INFILL.

00:52:22.773 --> 00:52:28.612 region:rollup2
IT WAS NOT THE SOLE HYBRIDS BUT

00:52:23.707 --> 00:52:30.247 region:rollup2
BY TAP PLUGINS.

00:52:28.612 --> 00:52:31.849 region:rollup2
WE ARE RISE SOLD OVER THREE

00:52:30.247 --> 00:52:33.651 region:rollup2
THOUSAND VEHICLES THE ONE AS

00:52:31.849 --> 00:52:35.019 region:rollup2
TOYOTA WITH OTHER AUTOMAKERS UP

00:52:33.651 --> 00:52:36.286 region:rollup2
OVER THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED. YEAH

00:52:35.019 --> 00:52:37.921 region:rollup2
SUCH A DROP IN THE BUCKET

00:52:36.286 --> 00:52:40.557 region:rollup2
COMPARED THE OVERALL AND DO YOU

00:52:37.921 --> 00:52:42.926 region:rollup2
THINK BY HAVING EXEMPTION ON

00:52:40.557 --> 00:52:44.895 region:rollup2
THAT SALES TAX THAT THIS WOULD

00:52:42.926 --> 00:52:46.864 region:rollup2
MAKE IT AT A DIFFERENCE FOR

00:52:44.895 --> 00:52:48.098 region:rollup2
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR.

00:52:46.864 --> 00:52:49.667 region:rollup2
ARE THERE OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE

00:52:48.098 --> 00:52:51.368 region:rollup2
THAT ARE WAY ABOVE THAT THE SALE

00:52:49.667 --> 00:52:52.503 region:rollup2
OF FUEL.

00:52:51.368 --> 00:52:54.705 region:rollup2
I THINK YES THAT THE YOU KNOW

00:52:52.503 --> 00:52:55.873 region:rollup2
THE SALES TAX IS A SIGNIFICANT

00:52:54.705 --> 00:52:56.940 region:rollup2
PORTION IT'S NEARLY TEN PERCENT

00:52:55.873 --> 00:52:58.142 region:rollup2
OF YOU LOOK AT THE AVERAGE

00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:59.643 region:rollup2
ACROSS ALL THE LOCATIONS THAT

00:52:58.142 --> 00:53:00.544 region:rollup2
WERE IN AND.

00:52:59.643 --> 00:53:02.713 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT.

00:53:00.544 --> 00:53:04.214 region:rollup2
IF WE CAN EVEN SHELVE THE

00:53:02.713 --> 00:53:05.649 region:rollup2
SIGNAL THAT THE PRICES STARTING

00:53:04.214 --> 00:53:06.750 region:rollup2
TO COME DOWN THAT WILL MAKE A

00:53:05.649 --> 00:53:07.918 region:rollup2
BIG DIFFERENCE TO US TO

00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:10.954 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS IN THIS NEAR TERM

00:53:07.918 --> 00:53:12.589 region:rollup2
MARKET.

00:53:10.954 --> 00:53:14.324 region:rollup2
THANK YOU. THANK YOU ESCORT.

00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:16.360 region:rollup2
SO I'M HAVING A HARD TIME

00:53:14.324 --> 00:53:18.028 region:rollup2
FIGURING THIS OUT.

00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:20.597 region:rollup2
SO I ALMOST I ENDED UP GETTING

00:53:18.028 --> 00:53:21.865 region:rollup2
THE HONDA CLARITY FUEL CELL.

00:53:20.597 --> 00:53:23.500 region:rollup2
AND I USE THE TRIGGER ZERO

00:53:21.865 --> 00:53:25.836 region:rollup2
STATION.

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:27.805 region:rollup2
ABA KIND OF BETA TESTERS HITS

00:53:25.836 --> 00:53:29.540 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY WELL YOUR STATIONS

00:53:27.805 --> 00:53:31.041 region:rollup2
ARE PRETTY GOOD.

00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:33.310 region:rollup2
AND LINDY STATIONS ARE AWFUL

00:53:31.041 --> 00:53:34.611 region:rollup2
ANYWAY.

00:53:33.310 --> 00:53:36.146 region:rollup2
SORRY ABOUT THAT IF THERE'S A

00:53:34.611 --> 00:53:37.748 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY FROM LINDA HERE BUT I

00:53:36.146 --> 00:53:38.549 region:rollup2
CAN DOCUMENT IT.

00:53:37.748 --> 00:53:41.318 region:rollup2
ANYWAY.

00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:42.453 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE KIND OF BETA TESTERS.

00:53:41.318 --> 00:53:43.754 region:rollup2
AND.

00:53:42.453 --> 00:53:45.155 region:rollup2
I WOULD APPRECIATE SOMETHING

00:53:43.754 --> 00:53:46.724 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD HELP US THE PROBLEM

00:53:45.155 --> 00:53:49.560 region:rollup2
IS THIS REALLY DOESN'T EVERYONE

00:53:46.724 --> 00:53:51.161 region:rollup2
WHO BUYS A CAR TODAY.

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:53.063 region:rollup2
THE FUEL IS PAID FOR BY THE

00:53:51.161 --> 00:53:55.499 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURER WHETHER IT'S TOYOTA

00:53:53.063 --> 00:53:58.836 region:rollup2
OR HONDA OR ANYONE ELSE.

00:53:55.499 --> 00:54:00.804 region:rollup2
AND I WAS TOLD THAT.

00:53:58.836 --> 00:54:02.539 region:rollup2
NOT TOO EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO BY

00:54:00.804 --> 00:54:03.907 region:rollup2
THIS BECAUSE FRANKLY THE FUEL

00:54:02.539 --> 00:54:05.075 region:rollup2
CELL TECHNOLOGY IS PROBABLY

00:54:03.907 --> 00:54:06.977 region:rollup2
GONNA BE VERY DIFFERENT AT THE

00:54:05.075 --> 00:54:08.479 region:rollup2
END OF MY THREE YEAR LEASE.

00:54:06.977 --> 00:54:10.981 region:rollup2
AND TYPICALLY THESE HAVE THREE

00:54:08.479 --> 00:54:13.383 region:rollup2
YEAR LEASES WERE TALKING ABOUT.

00:54:10.981 --> 00:54:15.519 region:rollup2
A FIVE YEAR SUNSET AND NO ONE IS

00:54:13.383 --> 00:54:17.287 region:rollup2
PAINFUL NO CONSUMER IS PAYING

00:54:15.519 --> 00:54:20.157 region:rollup2
FOR HYDROGEN.

00:54:17.287 --> 00:54:21.892 region:rollup2
SO IT WOULD CLEARLY HELP.

00:54:20.157 --> 00:54:22.459 region:rollup2
EITHER THE MANUFACTURER WHO

00:54:21.892 --> 00:54:24.328 region:rollup2
WOULD BE PAYING TEN PERCENT

00:54:22.459 --> 00:54:25.829 region:rollup2
LAST.

00:54:24.328 --> 00:54:27.931 region:rollup2
OR THE RETAILER I'M NOT QUITE

00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:29.333 region:rollup2
SURE. WHETHER THE REACH WHETHER

00:54:27.931 --> 00:54:31.602 region:rollup2
YOU IS A RETAILER WOULD BE DO

00:54:29.333 --> 00:54:32.503 region:rollup2
SHARE PRICE TEN PERCENTER.

00:54:31.602 --> 00:54:34.404 region:rollup2
AND GIVE IT ON TO THE

00:54:32.503 --> 00:54:36.406 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURER WHETHER IT WOULD

00:54:34.404 --> 00:54:38.609 region:rollup2
JUST HELP YOUR BUSINESS. AND I'M

00:54:36.406 --> 00:54:40.811 region:rollup2
WILLING TO SAY YOU KNOW IF THE

00:54:38.609 --> 00:54:42.513 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURER THANKS.

00:54:40.811 --> 00:54:44.748 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD HELP THEM OR IF YOU

00:54:42.513 --> 00:54:46.517 region:rollup2
THINK YOU REALLY NEED THAT BOOST

00:54:44.748 --> 00:54:47.951 region:rollup2
YOUR PROFITS THAT'S FINE BUT I

00:54:46.517 --> 00:54:49.386 region:rollup2
JUST DON'T SEE HOW IT HELPS

00:54:47.951 --> 00:54:51.722 region:rollup2
CONSUMER.

00:54:49.386 --> 00:54:52.356 region:rollup2
.

00:54:51.722 --> 00:54:53.957 region:rollup2
SO.

00:54:52.356 --> 00:54:55.592 region:rollup2
LET ME WAY AND I'M SURE JACQUI

00:54:53.957 --> 00:54:57.361 region:rollup2
WILL KNOW ONE AWAY AS WELL SO I

00:54:55.592 --> 00:54:58.729 region:rollup2
THINK I'M. YOUR NUMBER ONE

00:54:57.361 --> 00:55:00.197 region:rollup2
THERE'S THIS THE SIGNAL THAT

00:54:58.729 --> 00:55:02.466 region:rollup2
THAT YOU SENT TO THE MARKET AND

00:55:00.197 --> 00:55:04.234 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW. AUTOMAKERS ARE PAYING

00:55:02.466 --> 00:55:05.302 region:rollup2
FOR THE FUEL IS A NECESSARY EVIL

00:55:04.234 --> 00:55:06.603 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO DO

00:55:05.302 --> 00:55:08.205 region:rollup2
THAT. THEY'RE DOING IT BECAUSE

00:55:06.603 --> 00:55:10.440 region:rollup2
IT FEELS UNNATURALLY RAY HOW

00:55:08.205 --> 00:55:11.074 region:rollup2
HIGH RIGHT NOW THE PRICES ARE

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:11.542 region:rollup2
NATURALLY HIGH RIGHT NOW IN THE

00:55:11.074 --> 00:55:13.343 region:rollup2
EARLY MARKET.

00:55:11.542 --> 00:55:14.478 region:rollup2
WE'RE IN ON THE NEAR TERM

00:55:13.343 --> 00:55:15.679 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOOD FOR US BECAUSE IT

00:55:14.478 --> 00:55:16.580 region:rollup2
TAKES SOME OF THE PRESSURE OFF

00:55:15.679 --> 00:55:18.549 region:rollup2
OF MY COMPANY FOR LOWERING THE

00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:19.750 region:rollup2
PRICE. BUT THAT'S NOT HEY CREATE

00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:21.618 region:rollup2
A REAL MARKET RIGHT AND ITS

00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:23.220 region:rollup2
CUSTOMERS KEEP GETTING USED TO

00:55:21.618 --> 00:55:24.588 region:rollup2
THOUGH OEM'S THE AUTOMAKERS

00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:26.223 region:rollup2
PAYING FOR THE FUEL. I MEAN

00:55:24.588 --> 00:55:27.457 region:rollup2
THAT'S LIKE CRACK COCAINE YEAH

00:55:26.223 --> 00:55:29.226 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GONNA WANT TO KEEP THAT.

00:55:27.457 --> 00:55:30.694 region:rollup2
THAT HABIT GOING AND GOING AND

00:55:29.226 --> 00:55:32.095 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT A WAY TO CREATE A

00:55:30.694 --> 00:55:33.831 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABLE LONG TERM MARKET. OF

00:55:32.095 --> 00:55:36.366 region:rollup2
THAT COST TO THE AUTOMAKERS WILL

00:55:33.831 --> 00:55:36.934 region:rollup2
BALLOON SO HIGH THAT. NOW THEY

00:55:36.366 --> 00:55:37.134 region:rollup2
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN

00:55:36.934 --> 00:55:38.902 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:55:37.134 --> 00:55:40.037 region:rollup2
AND I THINK OUT NUMBER TWO

00:55:38.902 --> 00:55:41.505 region:rollup2
THERE IS A QUESTION OF US

00:55:40.037 --> 00:55:42.873 region:rollup2
CUSTOMERS GET INTO THIS IN THE

00:55:41.505 --> 00:55:44.241 region:rollup2
LONG TERM THEY'RE CONSIDERING.

00:55:42.873 --> 00:55:45.509 region:rollup2
DIE WANT TO BUY THIS CAR OR LEAD

00:55:44.241 --> 00:55:47.144 region:rollup2
SAFE AND I THINK WITH THE HONDA

00:55:45.509 --> 00:55:48.278 region:rollup2
LEASES THE ONLY OPTION THAT

00:55:47.144 --> 00:55:49.980 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GIVING BUT THE MIRAI YOU

00:55:48.278 --> 00:55:50.514 region:rollup2
CAN ACTUALLY BUY IT AS WELL. ARE

00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:51.648 region:rollup2
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S

00:55:50.514 --> 00:55:53.317 region:rollup2
DISSUADING CUSTOMERS FROM BUYING

00:55:51.648 --> 00:55:53.951 region:rollup2
THE CAR BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW

00:55:53.317 --> 00:55:55.018 region:rollup2
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THE PRICE

00:55:53.951 --> 00:55:56.420 region:rollup2
OF FUEL AND THEIR.

00:55:55.018 --> 00:55:57.988 region:rollup2
THEIR FEELS ONLY GETTING PAID

00:55:56.420 --> 00:56:00.257 region:rollup2
FOR FOR A THREE YEAR TIME PERIOD

00:55:57.988 --> 00:56:01.391 region:rollup2
SO NINE SO WOULD GO DOWN FROM

00:56:00.257 --> 00:56:03.227 region:rollup2
THE EQUIVALENT OF ABOUT EIGHT

00:56:01.391 --> 00:56:03.760 region:rollup2
DOLLARS A GALLON TWO SEVEN

00:56:03.227 --> 00:56:05.095 region:rollup2
TWENTY.

00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:06.897 region:rollup2
THAT'S ABOUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING

00:56:05.095 --> 00:56:08.765 region:rollup2
ABOUT BECAUSE IT SIXTEEN DOLLARS

00:56:06.897 --> 00:56:10.667 region:rollup2
A KILOGRAM AND. ROUGHLY

00:56:08.765 --> 00:56:12.703 region:rollup2
KILOGRAMS WORTH YOU GET ABOUT

00:56:10.667 --> 00:56:14.404 region:rollup2
SIXTY MILES.

00:56:12.703 --> 00:56:16.273 region:rollup2
AND WE DO PLAN TO PASS THAT COST

00:56:14.404 --> 00:56:17.674 region:rollup2
ON TO THE CONSUMER WON'T. BE

00:56:16.273 --> 00:56:20.077 region:rollup2
IMPACTS OUR PROFIT FOR COMPANY.

00:56:17.674 --> 00:56:21.812 region:rollup2

YOUR POINT ABOUT THE LEAD PAINT.

01:20:59.555 --> 01:21:04.293 region:rollup2
BUT I STILL THINK THAT IT WILL

01:21:02.024 --> 01:21:05.661 region:rollup2
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT THE

01:21:04.293 --> 01:21:08.197 region:rollup2
LOWER INCOME FOLKS BECAUSE THE

01:21:08.197 --> 01:21:11.900 region:rollup2

IT'S THERE'S A MEMBER ON THE

01:21:14.236 --> 01:21:16.205 region:rollup2
LOWER END OF THE SCALE I WILL

01:21:15.938 --> 01:21:17.806 region:rollup2
SAY THAT.

01:21:16.205 --> 01:21:21.143 region:rollup2
.

01:21:17.806 --> 01:21:22.211 region:rollup2
JUST.

01:21:21.143 --> 01:21:24.580 region:rollup2
TO BE FAIR.

01:21:22.211 --> 01:21:27.683 region:rollup2
THE LIST THAT WE WERE GIVEN

01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:30.085 region:rollup2

TWO HUNDRED DIFFERENT PAINT

01:21:30.085 --> 01:21:32.521 region:rollup2
COMPANIES ARE OPPOSED TO THIS

01:21:31.553 --> 01:21:34.556 region:rollup2
BILL.

01:21:32.521 --> 01:21:36.325 region:rollup2
.

01:21:34.556 --> 01:21:38.193 region:rollup2
WE WOULD EXPECT PAINT COMPANIES

01:21:36.325 --> 01:21:39.261 region:rollup2
TO BE AGAINST THIS BILL SO I

01:21:38.193 --> 01:21:41.096 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW THAT THIS MOVES THE

01:21:39.261 --> 01:21:42.631 region:rollup2
NEEDLE FOR OUR FOR ANYONE WHO

01:21:41.096 --> 01:21:43.599 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE ON THE FENCE ABOUT THIS

01:21:42.631 --> 01:21:45.300 region:rollup2
BILL BECAUSE.

01:21:43.599 --> 01:21:47.169 region:rollup2
THIS AFFECTS ALL OF THEM SO

01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:48.437 region:rollup2
NATURALLY THEY WOULD BE AGAINST

01:21:47.169 --> 01:21:50.038 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT INCREASE THEIR

01:21:48.437 --> 01:21:51.473 region:rollup2
COSTS JUST FOR YOUR OWN. AYE

01:21:50.038 --> 01:21:52.975 region:rollup2

01:21:52.975 --> 01:21:56.311 region:rollup2
CLARIFY THAT NO I DON'T NEED

01:21:54.777 --> 01:21:57.813 region:rollup2
CLARIFICATION I JUST BUT THAT'S

01:21:56.311 --> 01:21:59.148 region:rollup2
NOT A LIST OF COMPANIES THAT ARE

01:21:57.813 --> 01:22:01.116 region:rollup2
OPPOSED TO IT.

01:21:59.148 --> 01:22:03.418 region:rollup2
THAT'S JUST A LIST OF COMPANIES

01:22:01.116 --> 01:22:05.220 region:rollup2
THAT SELL PAINT INTO CALIFORNIA

01:22:03.418 --> 01:22:06.755 region:rollup2
OKAY FAIR ENOUGH WELL IT IT'S

01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:08.957 region:rollup2
PRESENTED AS THOUGH THESE ARE

01:22:06.755 --> 01:22:09.458 region:rollup2
THIS IS A LIST OF OPPOSITION IS

01:22:08.957 --> 01:22:11.393 region:rollup2
WELL I JUST WANTED YOU.

AND WE UNDERSTOOD WHAT I'M

01:22:12.161 --> 01:22:13.896 region:rollup2
SAYING GREAT OF COURSE WE WOULD

OUR ACT.

01:22:13.896 --> 01:22:17.966 region:rollup2
SO BUT AGAIN I THINK IT GOES

01:22:16.064 --> 01:22:19.301 region:rollup2
BACK TO THE COST BE IS ALWAYS

01:22:17.966 --> 01:22:21.703 region:rollup2
PASSED ON TO THE CONSUMER.

01:22:19.301 --> 01:22:23.872 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT TO BE TRUE AND SO

01:22:21.703 --> 01:22:26.208 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE REASONS I'M I'M NOT

WHETHER IT'S.

01:22:40.456 --> 01:22:44.059 region:rollup2
HOW PASSED ON THE CONSUMER

01:22:42.324 --> 01:22:45.794 region:rollup2
PASSED ON OF THE TAXPAYER IS THE

01:22:44.059 --> 01:22:47.529 region:rollup2
QUESTION I THINK THAT THE AUTHOR

01:22:45.794 --> 01:22:49.097 region:rollup2
IS IS BRINGING UP THIS ISSUE

01:22:47.529 --> 01:22:50.833 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF IT IS THAT?

01:22:49.097 --> 01:22:53.101 region:rollup2
A BOND THAT GOES BEFORE THE

01:22:50.833 --> 01:22:54.803 region:rollup2

01:22:57.139 --> 01:23:00.542 region:rollup2
IF THE AB BOND PASSES AND THAT

01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:01.977 region:rollup2

01:23:01.977 --> 01:23:05.514 region:rollup2
