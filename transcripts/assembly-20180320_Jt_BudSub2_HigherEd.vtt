ELECTION.

00:38:44.789 --> 00:38:49.194 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU SAW THE FRUSTRATION?

00:38:46.825 --> 00:38:52.263 region:rollup2
OF WORKING CLASS AMERICANS.

00:38:49.194 --> 00:38:53.364 region:rollup2
CHAU ITSELF.

00:38:52.263 --> 00:38:55.934 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THESE WORKING CLASS

00:38:53.364 --> 00:38:57.135 region:rollup2
AMERICANS ARE FINDING IT HARD.

00:38:55.934 --> 00:38:59.137 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT HOW TO MOVE FORWARD

00:38:57.135 --> 00:39:01.873 region:rollup2
IN THIS ECONOMY.

00:38:59.137 --> 00:39:03.908 region:rollup2
SO WE NEED A RELENTLESS FOCUS ON

00:39:01.873 --> 00:39:05.910 region:rollup2
IDENTIFYING WHAT.

00:39:03.908 --> 00:39:07.445 region:rollup2
WORKING AGE ADULTS NEED.

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:08.713 region:rollup2
CREATING A PERSONALIZED

00:39:07.445 --> 00:39:10.582 region:rollup2
COMPETENCY BASED PLATFORM TO

00:39:08.713 --> 00:39:13.117 region:rollup2
REACH THEM.

00:39:10.582 --> 00:39:14.686 region:rollup2
ENSURING THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS

00:39:13.117 --> 00:39:16.487 region:rollup2
HAVE OPPORTUNITY

00:39:14.686 --> 00:39:17.956 region:rollup2
ALONG THE WAY WE NEED TO

00:39:16.487 --> 00:39:20.458 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO BUILD OUT THE

00:39:17.956 --> 00:39:22.026 region:rollup2
PIPELINE FOR CURRENT STUDENTS

00:39:20.458 --> 00:39:23.328 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT

00:39:22.026 --> 00:39:24.596 region:rollup2
OUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES.

00:39:23.328 --> 00:39:26.464 region:rollup2
AND ALLOW THEM THE FLEXIBILITY

00:39:24.596 --> 00:39:26.965 region:rollup2
TO BETTER SERVE THE CALIFORNIANS

00:39:26.464 --> 00:39:28.399 region:rollup2
THAT ARE ALREADY IN THE

00:39:26.965 --> 00:39:29.534 region:rollup2
PIPELINE.

00:39:28.399 --> 00:39:31.336 region:rollup2
BUT I BELIEVE WE ALSO NEED ONE

00:39:29.534 --> 00:39:32.737 region:rollup2
MORE TOOL.

00:39:31.336 --> 00:39:33.705 region:rollup2
TWO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SKILLS

00:39:32.737 --> 00:39:37.041 region:rollup2
FOR THE WORKERS ARE IN THE

00:39:33.705 --> 00:39:38.443 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE TODAY.

00:39:37.041 --> 00:39:38.977 region:rollup2
I'VE BEEN INVITED TO SPEAK MANY

00:39:38.443 --> 00:39:40.044 region:rollup2
TIMES ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA

00:39:38.977 --> 00:39:41.613 region:rollup2
MASTER PLAN.

00:39:40.044 --> 00:39:43.081 region:rollup2
AND WHILE.

00:39:41.613 --> 00:39:45.183 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:39:43.081 --> 00:39:46.618 region:rollup2
SEMINAL DOCUMENT.

00:39:45.183 --> 00:39:48.620 region:rollup2
REALLY DR THE LOT OF THE

00:39:46.618 --> 00:39:49.821 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS WE HAVE ABOUT.

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:51.923 region:rollup2
OUR THREE SYSTEMS OF HIGHER

00:39:49.821 --> 00:39:53.691 region:rollup2
EDUCATION INCLUDING.

00:39:51.923 --> 00:39:54.759 region:rollup2
THE.

00:39:53.691 --> 00:39:55.894 region:rollup2
THE VERY HARD WORKING.

00:39:54.759 --> 00:39:57.428 region:rollup2
.

00:39:55.894 --> 00:39:59.197 region:rollup2
PRIVATE NON PROFITS.

00:39:57.428 --> 00:40:00.265 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:39:59.197 --> 00:40:02.467 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY THAT WE'RE TALKING

00:40:00.265 --> 00:40:04.469 region:rollup2
ABOUT HERE TODAY HAS BEEN LEFT

00:40:02.467 --> 00:40:06.304 region:rollup2
OUT OF THE CALIFORNIA MASTER.

00:40:04.469 --> 00:40:08.740 region:rollup2
IT DID NOT CONTEMPLATE.

00:40:06.304 --> 00:40:11.075 region:rollup2
UP SPILLING OR RESCALING AN

00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:12.510 region:rollup2
ENTIRE WORKFORCE.

00:40:11.075 --> 00:40:14.379 region:rollup2
SO WE NEED GO BACK AND THINK

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:16.180 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW WE ANSWERED THAT

00:40:14.379 --> 00:40:17.348 region:rollup2
QUESTION GOING FORWARD.

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:18.750 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE

00:40:17.348 --> 00:40:20.518 region:rollup2
MASTER PLAN.

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:21.019 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A SYSTEM.

00:40:20.518 --> 00:40:22.287 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE

00:40:21.019 --> 00:40:23.855 region:rollup2
COLLEGES

00:40:22.287 --> 00:40:24.923 region:rollup2
THERE ARE BETH POSITION.

00:40:23.855 --> 00:40:29.193 region:rollup2
TO DEAL WITH THAT.

00:40:24.923 --> 00:40:30.662 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE.

00:40:29.193 --> 00:40:32.864 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE AND I BELIEVE.

00:40:30.662 --> 00:40:33.698 region:rollup2
ON OUR BOARD OF GOVERNORS ALSO

00:40:32.864 --> 00:40:35.533 region:rollup2
BELIEVES THAT THE STRANDED

00:40:37.001 --> 00:40:40.738 region:rollup2
DOCUMENT.

00:40:38.102 --> 00:40:41.806 region:rollup2
THAT LISTS.

00:40:40.738 --> 00:40:44.709 region:rollup2
WHERE THE STRANDED WORKERS ARE

00:40:41.806 --> 00:40:47.312 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE STATE?

00:40:44.709 --> 00:40:48.613 region:rollup2
THESE INDIVIDUALS MUST BE GIVEN

00:40:47.312 --> 00:40:50.648 region:rollup2
AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY PUT

00:40:48.613 --> 00:40:55.486 region:rollup2

00:40:50.648 --> 00:40:57.388 region:rollup2
PATH TOWARD GREATER PROSPERITY.

00:40:55.486 --> 00:41:00.325 region:rollup2
IN THAT FIRST DOCUMENT THAT YOU

SEE WITH THE MAP OF CALIFORNIA.

00:41:00.325 --> 00:41:02.961 region:rollup2
IT IDENTIFIES THE TWO AND A HALF

00:41:01.726 --> 00:41:04.562 region:rollup2
MILLION CALIFORNIANS BETWEEN THE

00:41:02.961 --> 00:41:05.530 region:rollup2
AGES OF TWENTY FIVE THIRTY FOUR

00:41:04.562 --> 00:41:06.664 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE NOT ATTAINED A

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:08.132 region:rollup2
CREDENTIAL NEEDED FOR ECONOMIC

00:41:06.664 --> 00:41:11.703 region:rollup2
MOBILITY.

00:41:08.132 --> 00:41:14.472 region:rollup2
THIS POPULATION NO SURPRISE.

00:41:11.703 --> 00:41:16.207 region:rollup2
IT'S NEARLY HALF LATINO.

00:41:14.472 --> 00:41:18.209 region:rollup2
THIRTY ONE PERCENT WHITE NINE

00:41:16.207 --> 00:41:19.243 region:rollup2

AND AS I MENTIONED ANOTHER SIX

00:41:23.381 --> 00:41:26.217 region:rollup2
POINT TWO MILLION ADULTS BETWEEN

00:41:24.983 --> 00:41:28.953 region:rollup2
THIRTY FIVE AND SIXTY FIVE ARE

00:41:26.217 --> 00:41:30.755 region:rollup2
IN SIMILAR SITUATIONS.

00:41:28.953 --> 00:41:32.890 region:rollup2
ON THE BACK OF THE DOCUMENT YOU

00:41:30.755 --> 00:41:35.393 region:rollup2
CAN ALSO SEE BY ASSEMBLY

00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:37.729 region:rollup2
DISTRICT. THE NUMBER OF STRANDED

00:41:35.393 --> 00:41:39.097 region:rollup2
WORKERS AS WE CALL THEM.

00:41:37.729 --> 00:41:40.365 region:rollup2
THAT ARE IN THE VARIOUS ASSEMBLY

00:41:39.097 --> 00:41:43.101 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS REPRESENTED.

00:41:40.365 --> 00:41:45.470 region:rollup2

00:41:50.241 --> 00:41:52.944 region:rollup2
THIS IS I'M NOT BRINGING THIS UP

00:41:51.376 --> 00:41:54.379 region:rollup2
AT THE QUESTION OF WHETHER NOT

00:41:52.944 --> 00:41:56.514 region:rollup2
WE ALL SUPPORT THESE WORKERS THE

00:41:54.379 --> 00:41:57.048 region:rollup2
QUESTION IS HOW DO WE BEST

00:41:56.514 --> 00:41:58.015 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THESE WORKERS SO I

00:41:57.048 --> 00:41:59.183 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE.

00:41:58.015 --> 00:42:01.519 region:rollup2
THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO FOCUS

00:41:59.183 --> 00:42:02.754 region:rollup2
ON THEM.

00:42:01.519 --> 00:42:04.455 region:rollup2
THE PROSPECTS OF THESE STRANDED

00:42:02.754 --> 00:42:05.023 region:rollup2
WORKERS.

00:42:04.455 --> 00:42:07.158 region:rollup2
ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE

00:42:05.023 --> 00:42:09.293 region:rollup2
UNCERTAIN.

00:42:07.158 --> 00:42:10.862 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS JUST NOT A SAINT.

00:42:09.293 --> 00:42:11.863 region:rollup2
ACCORDING TO ESTIMATES BY THE

00:42:10.862 --> 00:42:13.364 region:rollup2
GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY CENTER ON

00:42:11.863 --> 00:42:15.600 region:rollup2

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:19.103 region:rollup2
SIXTY FIVE PERCENT.

00:42:17.969 --> 00:42:21.506 region:rollup2
OF ALL JOB THE UNITED STATES

00:42:19.103 --> 00:42:22.473 region:rollup2
WILL REQUIRE AT LEAST.

00:42:21.506 --> 00:42:24.475 region:rollup2
SOME COLLEGE POST SECONDARY

00:42:22.473 --> 00:42:25.309 region:rollup2
CREDENTIAL.

00:42:24.475 --> 00:42:26.544 region:rollup2
IN THE GROUND IS SHIFTING

00:42:25.309 --> 00:42:28.446 region:rollup2
QUICKLY.

00:42:26.544 --> 00:42:30.114 region:rollup2
AS I MENTIONED.

00:42:28.446 --> 00:42:30.915 region:rollup2
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

THEY OFTENLEAD TO PROBLEMATIC

00:42:38.856 --> 00:42:41.959 region:rollup2
GROWTH TOO MANY OF THESE WORKERS

00:42:40.725 --> 00:42:43.761 region:rollup2
OFTEN TURN TO THE FOR PROFITS

00:42:41.959 --> 00:42:45.830 region:rollup2
AND I MENTIONED EARLIER AND

00:42:43.761 --> 00:42:46.397 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN WHAT HAPPENS THERE.

00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:47.698 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN THE STUDIES THAT

00:42:46.397 --> 00:42:50.134 region:rollup2
SHOW.

00:42:47.698 --> 00:42:52.270 region:rollup2
EVEN. IF A STUDENT.

00:42:50.134 --> 00:42:53.571 region:rollup2

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:55.006 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD STILL BE IN A BETTER

00:42:53.571 --> 00:42:56.107 region:rollup2
POSITION THE ECONOMY THAN IF

00:42:55.006 --> 00:42:57.942 region:rollup2
THEY HAD ATTENDED A FOR PROFIT

00:42:56.107 --> 00:42:58.543 region:rollup2
COLLEGE.

ARE VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN

00:44:35.673 --> 00:44:38.876 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING OUT THESE PATHWAYS

00:44:37.041 --> 00:44:40.578 region:rollup2
IN ENSURING THAT WE REACHED THE

00:44:38.876 --> 00:44:41.646 region:rollup2
WORKERS THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT.

00:44:40.578 --> 00:44:43.214 region:rollup2
ON THE SECOND DOCUMENT YOU HAVE

00:44:41.646 --> 00:44:44.982 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THAT.

00:44:43.214 --> 00:44:46.317 region:rollup2
WE DESCRIBE THE CRITERIA.

00:44:44.982 --> 00:44:48.286 region:rollup2

THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE.

00:44:48.286 --> 00:44:50.788 region:rollup2
IS EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL

00:44:49.554 --> 00:44:52.223 region:rollup2
PATHWAYS HAS BEEN A LOT OF

00:44:50.788 --> 00:44:54.458 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT ARE THE

00:44:52.223 --> 00:44:56.627 region:rollup2
PATHWAYS THAT YOU'RE TALKING.

00:44:54.458 --> 00:44:58.396 region:rollup2
SO FIRST WE WANTED TO BE VERY

00:44:56.627 --> 00:45:00.231 region:rollup2
CAREFUL AND WORK WITH OUR LABOR

00:44:58.396 --> 00:45:01.165 region:rollup2
AND EMPLOYER PARTNERS.

00:45:00.231 --> 00:45:02.133 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE THAT WE DESIGN

00:45:01.165 --> 00:45:04.168 region:rollup2
PRINCIPLES

00:45:02.133 --> 00:45:05.169 region:rollup2
DESIGN PRINCIPLES.

00:45:04.168 --> 00:45:07.038 region:rollup2
THAT WILL GUIDE US IN DEVELOPING

00:45:05.169 --> 00:45:08.139 region:rollup2
THE PATHWAYS.

00:45:07.038 --> 00:45:09.840 region:rollup2
SO THE DOCUMENT YOU HAVE

00:45:08.139 --> 00:45:11.375 region:rollup2
OUTLINES.

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:12.944 region:rollup2
HOW THAT'S GONNA WORK WE WILL

00:45:11.375 --> 00:45:15.146 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON IN DEMAND?

00:45:12.944 --> 00:45:16.447 region:rollup2
FIELDS.

00:45:15.146 --> 00:45:18.416 region:rollup2
IT WILL BE STUDENT CENTERED

00:45:16.447 --> 00:45:19.650 region:rollup2
COMPETENCY BASED FOCUSED ON JOB

00:45:18.416 --> 00:45:20.918 region:rollup2
AREAS THAT REQUIRE SCALABLE

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:22.687 region:rollup2
RESPONSE.

00:45:20.918 --> 00:45:24.255 region:rollup2
BUILT ON EXISTING AND EMERGING

00:45:22.687 --> 00:45:25.723 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES AND IMPLEMENTED

00:45:24.255 --> 00:45:29.660 region:rollup2
THROUGH STRONG PARTNERSHIPS

00:45:25.723 --> 00:45:31.629 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE OUR PRINCIPLES.

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:33.831 region:rollup2
SO.

00:45:31.629 --> 00:45:35.600 region:rollup2
HOW WOULD WE MEASURE SUCCESS?

00:45:33.831 --> 00:45:36.901 region:rollup2
WE WOULD MEASURE SUCCESS.

00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:38.636 region:rollup2
BY WHETHER OR NOT.

00:45:36.901 --> 00:45:40.171 region:rollup2
AN INDIVIDUAL

00:45:38.636 --> 00:45:42.173 region:rollup2
STRANDED WORKER GAINS MORE

00:45:40.171 --> 00:45:42.740 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC MOBILITY DO THEY HAVE

00:45:42.173 --> 00:45:44.175 region:rollup2
WAGE GAINS AT THE END OF THE

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:46.110 region:rollup2
DAY.

00:45:44.175 --> 00:45:48.713 region:rollup2
THIS IS ABOUT.

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:50.147 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC MOBILITY DO THEY HAVE

00:45:48.713 --> 00:45:51.315 region:rollup2
DO THEY GET A PROMOTION DO THEY

00:45:50.147 --> 00:45:52.717 region:rollup2
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY INTO A

00:45:51.315 --> 00:45:54.986 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FIELD DO THEY HAVE

00:45:52.717 --> 00:45:56.254 region:rollup2
WAGE GAINS.

00:45:54.986 --> 00:45:57.622 region:rollup2
AND CAN THEY CONTINUE THEIR

00:45:56.254 --> 00:45:58.489 region:rollup2
EDUCATION ON TO A HIGHER LEVEL

00:45:57.622 --> 00:46:00.291 region:rollup2
CREDENTIAL.

00:45:58.489 --> 00:46:02.126 region:rollup2
THAT IS

00:46:00.291 --> 00:46:03.527 region:rollup2
THAT MEANS BY WHICH WE EXPECT

00:46:02.126 --> 00:46:05.763 region:rollup2
HOLD OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE.

00:46:03.527 --> 00:46:08.032 region:rollup2
SO.

00:46:05.763 --> 00:46:08.666 region:rollup2
WE HAVE IDENTIFIED AT LEAST

00:46:08.032 --> 00:46:10.568 region:rollup2
THREE AREAS THAT WE'RE GOING TO

00:46:08.666 --> 00:46:12.336 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON.

00:46:10.568 --> 00:46:14.338 region:rollup2
TO OUR VERTICAL PATHWAYS.

00:46:12.336 --> 00:46:14.839 region:rollup2
.

00:46:14.338 --> 00:46:17.475 region:rollup2
AND ONE IS A HORIZONTAL

00:46:14.839 --> 00:46:18.109 region:rollup2
PATHWAYS.

00:46:17.475 --> 00:46:20.111 region:rollup2
SO.

00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:22.046 region:rollup2
THAT INFORMATION IS.

00:46:20.111 --> 00:46:23.781 region:rollup2
IT'S IN YOUR PACKET BUT.

00:46:22.046 --> 00:46:24.081 region:rollup2
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WE'RE

00:46:23.781 --> 00:46:25.416 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT.

00:46:24.081 --> 00:46:26.550 region:rollup2
.

00:46:25.416 --> 00:46:27.985 region:rollup2
AT AT.

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:31.489 region:rollup2
THE HEALTHCARE FIELD.

00:46:27.985 --> 00:46:32.223 region:rollup2
.

00:46:31.489 --> 00:46:34.025 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS INFORMATION

00:46:32.223 --> 00:46:35.493 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY.

00:46:34.025 --> 00:46:37.428 region:rollup2
FOR THE HORIZONTAL PATHWAY WERE

00:46:35.493 --> 00:46:39.563 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON.

00:46:37.428 --> 00:46:42.099 region:rollup2
ADVANCING INDIVIDUALS WHO WANT

00:46:39.563 --> 00:46:43.801 region:rollup2
TO BE FIRST LINE SUPERVISORS.

00:46:42.099 --> 00:46:45.436 region:rollup2
AND HOW DO WE LAND ON THOSE AS I

00:46:43.801 --> 00:46:46.771 region:rollup2
SAID WE HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD.

00:46:45.436 --> 00:46:47.271 region:rollup2
WITH OUR PARTNERS THROUGHOUT THE

00:46:46.771 --> 00:46:51.709 region:rollup2
STATE TO IDENTIFY THOSE

00:46:47.271 --> 00:46:53.444 region:rollup2
PATHWAYS.

00:46:51.709 --> 00:46:55.012 region:rollup2
I WILL BEGIN TO.

00:46:53.444 --> 00:46:56.247 region:rollup2
TO CLOSE.

00:46:55.012 --> 00:46:58.382 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO ALLOW TIME FOR

00:46:56.247 --> 00:47:00.618 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS BUT.

00:46:58.382 --> 00:47:02.586 region:rollup2
LET ME.

00:47:00.618 --> 00:47:03.387 region:rollup2
TAKE SOME TIME TO CLARIFY.

00:47:02.586 --> 00:47:05.122 region:rollup2
SOME MISCONCEPTIONS ARE SOME

00:47:03.387 --> 00:47:06.891 region:rollup2
MYTHS.

00:47:05.122 --> 00:47:08.726 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL LET ME BE CLEAR.

00:47:06.891 --> 00:47:10.061 region:rollup2
WE HAVE NO INTENTION

00:47:08.726 --> 00:47:12.196 region:rollup2
NO DESIRE AND THERE IS NO

00:47:10.061 --> 00:47:13.798 region:rollup2
THOUGHT.

00:47:12.196 --> 00:47:15.966 region:rollup2
TO THE NOTION THAT WE WANT TO

00:47:13.798 --> 00:47:17.468 region:rollup2
PRIVATIZE CORPORATE TIES OR

00:47:15.966 --> 00:47:19.770 region:rollup2
COMMERCIALIZE THE CALIFORNIA

00:47:17.468 --> 00:47:21.205 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE CODES.

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:24.041 region:rollup2
I AM A PRODUCT OF CALIFORNIA

00:47:21.205 --> 00:47:25.142 region:rollup2
CAN BE.

00:47:24.041 --> 00:47:25.676 region:rollup2
THREE OF MY FOUR KIDS ARE

00:47:25.142 --> 00:47:27.611 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS OF CALIFORNIA ME

00:47:25.676 --> 00:47:30.214 region:rollup2
CAUSES.

00:47:27.611 --> 00:47:31.282 region:rollup2
THIS IS A CROWN JEWELS.

00:47:30.214 --> 00:47:32.516 region:rollup2
IN OUR NATION WE ARE GOING TO DO

00:47:31.282 --> 00:47:34.452 region:rollup2
NOTHING.

00:47:32.516 --> 00:47:36.053 region:rollup2
TO PRIVATIZE THIS IS

00:47:34.452 --> 00:47:38.556 region:rollup2
WE ARE GOING TO REMAIN A PUBLIC

00:47:36.053 --> 00:47:39.156 region:rollup2
SYSTEM. THAT.

00:47:38.556 --> 00:47:40.558 region:rollup2
REACHES MORE STUDENTS THROUGH

00:47:39.156 --> 00:47:44.195 region:rollup2
INNOVATION.

00:47:40.558 --> 00:47:46.197 region:rollup2
SECOND.

00:47:44.195 --> 00:47:48.365 region:rollup2
WE DON'T TEND TO OR HAVE ANY

00:47:46.197 --> 00:47:48.899 region:rollup2
DESIRE TO CANNIBALIZE ENROLLMENT

00:47:48.365 --> 00:47:50.034 region:rollup2
FROM OUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN

00:47:48.899 --> 00:47:52.236 region:rollup2
COLLEGES.

00:47:50.034 --> 00:47:52.970 region:rollup2
SO MATTER FACT WE WANT TO BUILD.

00:47:52.236 --> 00:47:55.272 region:rollup2
THE ENROLLMENT FOR A HUNDRED

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:57.174 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN COLLEGES.

00:47:55.272 --> 00:47:59.410 region:rollup2
MANY YOU UNDERSTAND.

00:47:57.174 --> 00:48:00.978 region:rollup2
THERE ARE COLLEGES ARE NERVOUS.

00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:03.214 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NERVOUS BECAUSE WE HAVE

00:48:00.978 --> 00:48:05.015 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT DECLINE IN THE STATE.

00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:06.050 region:rollup2
OUR COLLEGES ARE STRUGGLING.

00:48:05.015 --> 00:48:06.450 region:rollup2
TO GET THE ENROLLMENT THEY NEED

00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:09.019 region:rollup2
TO MAKE THEIR BASE

00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:09.653 region:rollup2
FUNDING.

00:48:09.019 --> 00:48:10.221 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL THAT YOU HAVE COMING UP

00:48:09.653 --> 00:48:12.256 region:rollup2
NEXT

00:48:10.221 --> 00:48:13.624 region:rollup2
FOCUSES ON THAT.

00:48:12.256 --> 00:48:15.493 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:48:13.624 --> 00:48:18.162 region:rollup2
HERE IS REACHING STUDENTS.

00:48:15.493 --> 00:48:19.463 region:rollup2
THAT NEED JOB SKILL CREDENTIALS

00:48:18.162 --> 00:48:20.865 region:rollup2
NOT THE TYPICAL UNDERGRADUATE

00:48:19.463 --> 00:48:22.600 region:rollup2
EDUCATION HAPPENS AT OUR FOUR

00:48:20.865 --> 00:48:23.401 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES.

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:25.269 region:rollup2
SO WE DON'T SEE THAT THIS WOULD

00:48:23.401 --> 00:48:25.870 region:rollup2
CANNIBALIZE IS MATTER FACT WE

00:48:25.269 --> 00:48:27.204 region:rollup2
THINK IT WOULD CREATE A NEW CO

00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:28.773 region:rollup2
HEART.

00:48:27.204 --> 00:48:30.708 region:rollup2
OF INDIVIDUALS WHO THEN CAN

00:48:28.773 --> 00:48:32.042 region:rollup2
ACCESS MORE EDUCATION HIGHER

00:48:30.708 --> 00:48:33.377 region:rollup2
LEVEL CREDENTIALS AT A HUNDRED

00:48:32.042 --> 00:48:34.645 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN COLLEGES.

00:48:33.377 --> 00:48:35.112 region:rollup2
SO WE THINK THAT THIS WILL BE A

00:48:34.645 --> 00:48:38.649 region:rollup2
NET BENEFIT.

00:48:35.112 --> 00:48:39.917 region:rollup2
THE ENTIRE SYSTEM.

00:48:38.649 --> 00:48:40.718 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO BEEN A LOT OF TALK

00:48:39.917 --> 00:48:42.887 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

00:48:40.718 --> 00:48:43.087 region:rollup2
THE HUNDRED FIFTEENTH COLLEGE

00:48:42.887 --> 00:48:45.256 region:rollup2
BEAN.

00:48:43.087 --> 00:48:45.790 region:rollup2
.

00:48:45.256 --> 00:48:48.092 region:rollup2
THE FAITHFUL TO COLLECTIVE

00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:50.928 region:rollup2
BARGAINING.

00:48:48.092 --> 00:48:52.263 region:rollup2
IT WOULD ABSOLUTELY BE.

00:48:50.928 --> 00:48:54.298 region:rollup2
A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING.

00:48:52.263 --> 00:48:55.900 region:rollup2
COLLEGE.

00:48:54.298 --> 00:48:57.902 region:rollup2
THE FACULTY IN THE CLASSIFIED

00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:59.336 region:rollup2
STAFF WOULD HAVE. EVERY RIGHT IN

00:48:57.902 --> 00:49:01.539 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY.

00:48:59.336 --> 00:49:03.040 region:rollup2
CHOOSE A BARGAINING UNIT.

00:49:01.539 --> 00:49:04.942 region:rollup2
TO NEGOTIATE.

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:06.544 region:rollup2
SALARY.

00:49:04.942 --> 00:49:07.044 region:rollup2
WORKING CONDITIONS JUSTICE ALL

00:49:06.544 --> 00:49:08.813 region:rollup2
OF OUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN

00:49:07.044 --> 00:49:10.281 region:rollup2
COLLEGES.

00:49:08.813 --> 00:49:11.515 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD NOT CHANGE AND THAT

00:49:10.281 --> 00:49:13.651 region:rollup2
IS OUR COMMITMENT.

00:49:11.515 --> 00:49:16.187 region:rollup2
SO IF THERE ARE SUGGESTIONS THAT

00:49:13.651 --> 00:49:16.821 region:rollup2
THIS GROUP HAS TO CLARIFY THAT.

00:49:16.187 --> 00:49:18.189 region:rollup2
WE'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO TAKE

00:49:16.821 --> 00:49:20.224 region:rollup2
THOSE

00:49:18.189 --> 00:49:22.893 region:rollup2
.

00:49:20.224 --> 00:49:24.161 region:rollup2
ALSO THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK.

00:49:22.893 --> 00:49:26.363 region:rollup2
IF THESE ADULTS

00:49:24.161 --> 00:49:28.332 region:rollup2
CANNOT LEARN.

00:49:26.363 --> 00:49:30.301 region:rollup2
IN AN ONLINE PLATFORM.

00:49:28.332 --> 00:49:33.904 region:rollup2
.

00:49:30.301 --> 00:49:36.006 region:rollup2
AND AFTER I PAUSE IN CONSIDER.

00:49:33.904 --> 00:49:36.173 region:rollup2
WHERE THAT COMES FROM I I HAVE

00:49:36.006 --> 00:49:37.808 region:rollup2
TO?

00:49:36.173 --> 00:49:39.443 region:rollup2
?

00:49:37.808 --> 00:49:39.610 region:rollup2
TRIED TO RESPOND.

00:49:39.443 --> 00:49:40.644 region:rollup2
AS.

00:49:39.610 --> 00:49:43.581 region:rollup2

00:49:40.644 --> 00:49:46.150 region:rollup2
AS.

00:49:43.581 --> 00:49:46.650 region:rollup2
CALMLY AS POSSIBLE.

00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:47.418 region:rollup2
THESE INDIVIDUALS LEARN

00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:49.253 region:rollup2
EVERYDAY.

00:49:47.418 --> 00:49:51.188 region:rollup2
ON THE JOB.

00:49:49.253 --> 00:49:52.990 region:rollup2
THESE OUR VETERANS WHO LEARNED A

00:49:51.188 --> 00:49:54.358 region:rollup2
GREAT DEAL OF SKILLS. WHILE IN

00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:56.093 region:rollup2
THE MILITARY THESE ARE

00:49:54.358 --> 00:49:57.294 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE MASTERED

00:49:56.093 --> 00:49:59.630 region:rollup2

JOB THEY CAN'T WORK.

00:49:59.630 --> 00:50:01.966 region:rollup2
BUT THEY'VE LEARNED THROUGH

00:50:00.197 --> 00:50:03.534 region:rollup2
COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION THEY

CONCERN WITH THIS PROPOSAL IS

00:57:26.276 --> 00:57:28.812 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:57:27.477 --> 00:57:30.080 region:rollup2
THAT THE PROPOSED SOLUTION IS

00:57:28.812 --> 00:57:31.348 region:rollup2
NOT TIED TO SPECIFIC ROUTE

00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:34.051 region:rollup2

00:57:31.348 --> 00:57:34.885 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THAT THE PROPOSAL'S

00:57:34.051 --> 00:57:36.820 region:rollup2

EXOTIC IN GENERAL WE DON'T AND

00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:39.589 region:rollup2
CONCERNS WITH THE.

00:57:37.854 --> 00:57:41.425 region:rollup2
IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S

00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:43.827 region:rollup2
INTEREST IN PROVIDING ADDITIONAL

00:57:41.425 --> 00:57:44.761 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL OPTIONS FOR THIS

00:57:43.827 --> 00:57:46.296 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP

00:57:44.761 --> 00:57:47.631 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT IF

00:57:46.296 --> 00:57:48.732 region:rollup2
AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE.

00:57:47.631 --> 00:57:50.634 region:rollup2
INTERSTATE THAT IS.

00:57:48.732 --> 00:57:52.436 region:rollup2
OF MOST LIKELY TO DO WORSE IN

00:57:50.634 --> 00:57:53.570 region:rollup2
RECESSION THAN HAVE A HARDER

00:57:52.436 --> 00:57:55.105 region:rollup2
TIME RECOVERING.

00:57:53.570 --> 00:57:56.006 region:rollup2
THERE ARE THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:57:55.105 --> 00:57:58.909 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WHO DON'T HAVE ANY

00:57:56.006 --> 00:58:00.677 region:rollup2
POST SECONDARY EDUCATION AND

00:57:58.909 --> 00:58:01.678 region:rollup2
TRYING TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL.

00:58:00.677 --> 00:58:02.913 region:rollup2
ARE KIND OF A CHANGE THE WAY WE

00:58:01.678 --> 00:58:04.114 region:rollup2
PROVIDE SERVICES TO THEM SO THEY

00:58:02.913 --> 00:58:05.549 region:rollup2
CAN INCREASE THEIR EDUCATIONAL

00:58:04.114 --> 00:58:06.149 region:rollup2
COMES THE DIPPING WE HAVE NO

00:58:05.549 --> 00:58:07.084 region:rollup2
CONCERNS WITH THAT PARTICULAR

00:58:06.149 --> 00:58:09.086 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

00:58:07.084 --> 00:58:10.721 region:rollup2
I THINK OUR OUR OUR KEEP OUR KEY

00:58:09.086 --> 00:58:11.822 region:rollup2
CONCERN IS THAT IT IN THE

00:58:10.721 --> 00:58:13.357 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL THERE'S NO

00:58:11.822 --> 00:58:14.491 region:rollup2
CLARIFICATION OF WHAT WHAT WE

00:58:13.357 --> 00:58:15.659 region:rollup2
THINK ARE THE MAIN BARRIERS FOR

00:58:14.491 --> 00:58:18.362 region:rollup2
THIS GROUP.

00:58:15.659 --> 00:58:19.629 region:rollup2
NOT NO INFORMATION THAT GIVE

00:58:18.362 --> 00:58:21.898 region:rollup2
THE FENCE THAT THAT THERE IS A

00:58:19.629 --> 00:58:24.368 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC UP PROBLEM WITH ACCESS

00:58:21.898 --> 00:58:25.569 region:rollup2
THAT IS THAT IS. THAT IT'S BEEN

00:58:24.368 --> 00:58:26.403 region:rollup2
THOUGHT BY THE ON MY COMMUTE

00:58:25.569 --> 00:58:28.271 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT OUR

00:58:26.403 --> 00:58:29.206 region:rollup2
PARTY CONCERN AND AND AND MORE

00:58:28.271 --> 00:58:30.941 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY.

00:58:29.206 --> 00:58:32.209 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE

00:58:30.941 --> 00:58:33.643 region:rollup2
STUDENT IS NOT BEING SERVED BY

00:58:32.209 --> 00:58:35.045 region:rollup2
THE BY THE EXISTING

00:58:33.643 --> 00:58:35.512 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATIVE BETTER I DON'T

00:58:35.045 --> 00:58:36.213 region:rollup2
THINK WE HAVE A CLEAR

00:58:35.512 --> 00:58:38.015 region:rollup2
INDICATION.

00:58:36.213 --> 00:58:38.582 region:rollup2
THAT WE THINK THAT THE COLLEGES

00:58:38.015 --> 00:58:39.750 region:rollup2
ARE DOING SOMETHING WRONG TO

00:58:38.582 --> 00:58:40.951 region:rollup2
PREVENTING THESE

00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:41.752 region:rollup2
STUDENTS FROM BEING SERVED

00:58:40.951 --> 00:58:43.487 region:rollup2
THIRTY POTENTIAL STUDENTS FROM

00:58:41.752 --> 00:58:45.188 region:rollup2
BEING SERVANTS I THINK. WITHOUT

00:58:43.487 --> 00:58:46.790 region:rollup2
HAVING A CLEAR SENSE OF WHAT WE

00:58:45.188 --> 00:58:48.492 region:rollup2
THINK BUT WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS

00:58:46.790 --> 00:58:49.192 region:rollup2
THAT THE COLLEGES FIXING. IF

00:58:48.492 --> 00:58:50.660 region:rollup2
IT'S HARD FOR US TO FEEL

00:58:49.192 --> 00:58:52.496 region:rollup2
CONFIDENT THAT THIS INVESTMENT

00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:54.398 region:rollup2
WHEN THE THIRTY RESULT IN THE IN

00:58:52.496 --> 00:58:55.265 region:rollup2
THE OUTCOME IMPROVEMENT OUTCOMES

00:58:54.398 --> 00:58:57.901 region:rollup2
THAT WE WANT.

00:58:55.265 --> 00:58:59.669 region:rollup2
PREEMPT IN PARTICULAR SO WE LET

00:58:57.901 --> 00:59:01.071 region:rollup2
ARE A FEW OTHER A PARTICULAR

00:58:59.669 --> 00:59:02.572 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT ARE IN OUR OFFICE

00:59:01.071 --> 00:59:03.673 region:rollup2
ONE OF THING I WOULD I WOULD.

00:59:02.572 --> 00:59:04.741 region:rollup2
PLAN I WAS ALSO.

00:59:03.673 --> 00:59:06.343 region:rollup2
THAT IS CHALLENGING ISSUE OF

00:59:04.741 --> 00:59:07.677 region:rollup2
TRYING TO FIND PARTNERSHIPS

00:59:06.343 --> 00:59:09.046 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE STATE BALL BEING A

00:59:07.677 --> 00:59:11.915 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE PROGRAM SO I THINK.

00:59:09.046 --> 00:59:13.550 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT IN MOST OF THE A

00:59:11.915 --> 00:59:15.385 region:rollup2
PROPOSED PATHWAYS THAT THAT DID

00:59:13.550 --> 00:59:17.154 region:rollup2
MISTER SMITH CONSIDERING. THERE

00:59:15.385 --> 00:59:18.255 region:rollup2
IS SOME KIND OF A NEED FOR A

00:59:17.154 --> 00:59:20.323 region:rollup2
HANDS ON COMPONENT WHETHER THAT

00:59:18.255 --> 00:59:22.125 region:rollup2
BE AT A COLLEGE. WHETHER THAT BE

00:59:20.323 --> 00:59:23.126 region:rollup2
RUN BY INDUSTRY WHETHER THAT THE

00:59:22.125 --> 00:59:25.062 region:rollup2
BEAST I'M.

00:59:23.126 --> 00:59:26.897 region:rollup2
IN SOME ASPECT EVEN JUST FINDING

00:59:25.062 --> 00:59:27.531 region:rollup2
SPACE FOR THAT TO BE AVAILABLE

00:59:26.897 --> 00:59:28.765 region:rollup2
THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN ACROSS THE

00:59:27.531 --> 00:59:30.567 region:rollup2
STATE.

00:59:28.765 --> 00:59:33.036 region:rollup2
I'M I THINK IT'S UNCLEAR FROTH.

00:59:30.567 --> 00:59:34.237 region:rollup2
HOW DOES? PARTNERSHIP WILL BE

00:59:33.036 --> 00:59:35.939 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED ALL ACROSS THE STATE

00:59:34.237 --> 00:59:37.874 region:rollup2
I'M IN ORDER FOR THE PROGRAMS TO

00:59:35.939 --> 00:59:39.042 region:rollup2
REALLY CREATE THE GIVE FOLKS THE

00:59:37.874 --> 00:59:40.377 region:rollup2
SKILLS THAT ARE NECESSARY WE

00:59:39.042 --> 00:59:42.712 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT.

00:59:40.377 --> 00:59:43.413 region:rollup2
BUT IF THAT IF THAT CAN HAPPEN

00:59:42.712 --> 00:59:44.381 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE THE NEITHER THOSE

00:59:43.413 --> 00:59:46.183 region:rollup2
SKILLS ARE NOT COULD BE

00:59:44.381 --> 00:59:47.884 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE OR TWO YOU HAVE SINCE

00:59:46.183 --> 00:59:49.619 region:rollup2
THE REGIONAL PROGRAMS THROUGH

00:59:47.884 --> 00:59:51.021 region:rollup2
THIS ONLINE COLLEGE IN AND.

00:59:49.619 --> 00:59:52.122 region:rollup2
TO US I THINK THE ISSUE OF

00:59:51.021 --> 00:59:53.323 region:rollup2
CREATING AN ONLINE BECAUSE TO

00:59:52.122 --> 00:59:56.259 region:rollup2
CREATE REGIONAL PROGRAM THINGS A

00:59:53.323 --> 00:59:56.893 region:rollup2
LOT CONSIDERING THAT. THAT THE

00:59:56.259 --> 00:59:57.761 region:rollup2
COLLEGES THEMSELVES ARE SORT OF

00:59:56.893 --> 00:59:59.796 region:rollup2
REGIONAL AND.

00:59:57.761 --> 01:00:00.430 region:rollup2
ON. THE THE OTHER THING I THINK

00:59:59.796 --> 01:00:01.097 region:rollup2
WE WERE JUST HIGHLIGHT AGAIN OF

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:02.299 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:00:01.097 --> 01:00:03.100 region:rollup2
CREATING THE A NEW COLLEGE

01:00:02.299 --> 01:00:04.601 region:rollup2
COMPARED TO WORKING WITHIN THE

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:05.802 region:rollup2
EXISTING SYSTEM MEANS THAT YOU

01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:07.104 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BUILD UP AN ORGANIZATION

01:00:05.802 --> 01:00:08.271 region:rollup2
FROM THE GROUND UP THAT MEANS

01:00:07.104 --> 01:00:09.306 region:rollup2
IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT LONGER

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:10.640 region:rollup2
TO GET THINGS UP AND RUNNING IN

01:00:09.306 --> 01:00:11.842 region:rollup2
THE ME THAT IT LIKELY WILL BE

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.542 region:rollup2
MORE COSTLY.

01:00:11.842 --> 01:00:14.644 region:rollup2
AND THEN BEFORE.

01:00:12.542 --> 01:00:15.445 region:rollup2
ANY ACCREDITATION YOU ARE GONNA

01:00:14.644 --> 01:00:16.213 region:rollup2
HAVE STUDENTS WHO ARE ENTERING

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:18.081 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM.

01:00:16.213 --> 01:00:18.949 region:rollup2
IN ERROR ARE.

01:00:18.081 --> 01:00:19.850 region:rollup2
IN A PROGRAM THAT'S NOT

01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:20.984 region:rollup2
ACCREDITED WHICH MEANS THEY

01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:23.053 region:rollup2
CAN'T APPLY FOR FEDERAL

01:00:20.984 --> 01:00:23.687 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AID AND THEY CAN'T

01:00:23.053 --> 01:00:25.856 region:rollup2
TRANSFER THE CREDITS TO ANOTHER

01:00:23.687 --> 01:00:27.757 region:rollup2
SCHOOL.

01:00:25.856 --> 01:00:29.726 region:rollup2
I'M SO ANDTHEN SWITCHING OVER

01:00:27.757 --> 01:00:31.027 region:rollup2
DEFEAT SIX JUST OUR ISSUES ARM

01:00:29.726 --> 01:00:31.995 region:rollup2
FREE TO CONSIDER WE DO THINK

01:00:31.027 --> 01:00:34.464 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE.

01:00:31.995 --> 01:00:35.632 region:rollup2
ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL OR THE

01:00:34.464 --> 01:00:37.000 region:rollup2
ELEMENT THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED

01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:38.535 region:rollup2
OF THINGS THAT WOULD BE PART OF

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.636 region:rollup2
THE COLLEGE THAT. THAT ARE

01:00:38.535 --> 01:00:41.104 region:rollup2
PROMISING THAT SEEMS TO BE

01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:41.771 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING ISSUES THAT WE'VE

01:00:41.104 --> 01:00:43.573 region:rollup2
HEARD IN THE PAST.

01:00:41.771 --> 01:00:45.375 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE THE IDEA OF HAVING

01:00:43.573 --> 01:00:46.042 region:rollup2
MORE PERSONALIZED COMPETENCY

01:00:45.375 --> 01:00:47.144 region:rollup2
BASED PROGRAM IS SOMETHING THAT

01:00:46.042 --> 01:00:48.879 region:rollup2
WE'VE HEARD.

01:00:47.144 --> 01:00:50.780 region:rollup2
THERE BE CONCERNS ABOUT AND

01:00:48.879 --> 01:00:51.915 region:rollup2
BEING ABLE TO. I USE THAT AS A

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:53.283 region:rollup2
WAY TO RECOGNIZE THE PRIOR

01:00:51.915 --> 01:00:54.918 region:rollup2
LEARNING AND SKILLS THE PEOPLE

01:00:53.283 --> 01:00:56.653 region:rollup2
WHO COME IN AND OUT TO GET

01:00:54.918 --> 01:00:59.189 region:rollup2
TRAINING MAKES A LOT OF FANS.

01:00:56.653 --> 01:01:00.357 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN FOR US WITH

01:00:59.189 --> 01:01:01.591 region:rollup2
BEING CLEAR ON WHY THE ONLINE

01:01:00.357 --> 01:01:02.726 region:rollup2
COLLEGES THIS.

01:01:01.591 --> 01:01:04.461 region:rollup2
THAT. THERE ARE YOU COULD ALSO

01:01:02.726 --> 01:01:05.762 region:rollup2
EXPLORE STATEWIDE IMPROVEMENTS

01:01:04.461 --> 01:01:07.931 region:rollup2
IN YOUR EXISTING FHA THUMB.

01:01:05.762 --> 01:01:10.033 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE FINDING WAYS TO.

01:01:07.931 --> 01:01:12.002 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGES COLLEGES TO DO

01:01:10.033 --> 01:01:13.069 region:rollup2
COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION ONE

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:15.005 region:rollup2
OF THE WAYS THAT YOU CAN DO THAT

01:01:13.069 --> 01:01:15.605 region:rollup2
IS BY CHANGING THE FISCAL MODEL

01:01:15.005 --> 01:01:17.140 region:rollup2
WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT YOU'LL

01:01:15.605 --> 01:01:19.042 region:rollup2
DISCOVER THE NEXT ITEM.

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:20.644 region:rollup2
I'M SO DID SO WE DO THINK THAT

01:01:19.042 --> 01:01:21.811 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF KEY

01:01:20.644 --> 01:01:22.579 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS THAT WOULD BE TOGETHER

01:01:21.811 --> 01:01:24.381 region:rollup2
TO TO.

01:01:22.579 --> 01:01:25.882 region:rollup2
TO MOVE IN THE DIRECTION AND

01:01:24.381 --> 01:01:27.083 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE FIFTH AVE A SOLUTION

01:01:25.882 --> 01:01:28.718 region:rollup2
THAT WE THINK ADDRESS OF THE.

01:01:27.083 --> 01:01:30.086 region:rollup2
THAT THE ROOT ISSUES WE

01:01:28.718 --> 01:01:31.588 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE WHAT FUTURE IT YOU

01:01:30.086 --> 01:01:33.123 region:rollup2
MIGHT STILL BE INTERESTED AND IN

01:01:31.588 --> 01:01:34.658 region:rollup2
PURSUING THIS KIND OF APPROACH

01:01:33.123 --> 01:01:36.092 region:rollup2
WE ENCOURAGE THOSE SEIZURE TO.

01:01:34.658 --> 01:01:36.660 region:rollup2
GATHER MORE INFORMATION ABOUT

01:01:36.092 --> 01:01:37.327 region:rollup2
WHAT THE UNDERLYING PROBLEMS

01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:39.129 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:01:37.327 --> 01:01:40.764 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE THE ROOT CAUSES OF

01:01:39.129 --> 01:01:41.698 region:rollup2
THESE PROBLEMS AND AND REALLY

01:01:40.764 --> 01:01:44.200 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT HOW A NEW ONLINE

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:46.303 region:rollup2
COLLEGE COULD BE DESIGNED TO

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:48.572 region:rollup2
RESPOND TO THOSE ISSUES AND THEN

01:01:46.303 --> 01:01:49.039 region:rollup2
HOW COULD BE FUNDED HELD

01:01:48.572 --> 01:01:49.806 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THOSE

01:01:49.039 --> 01:01:52.609 region:rollup2
OBJECTIVES?

01:01:49.806 --> 01:01:54.844 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:01:52.609 --> 01:01:58.848 region:rollup2
START NOW WITH OUR DISCUSSION

01:01:54.844 --> 01:02:02.085 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS.

01:01:58.848 --> 01:02:03.620 region:rollup2
IT'S A MEDINA.

01:02:02.085 --> 01:02:06.056 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION.

01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:08.124 region:rollup2
.

01:02:06.056 --> 01:02:09.659 region:rollup2
I I MIGHT START BY SAYING THAT I

01:02:08.124 --> 01:02:13.029 region:rollup2
WAS SKEPTICAL.

01:02:09.659 --> 01:02:14.397 region:rollup2
WHEN I IRST A HERD OF THE PLAN.

01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:17.033 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE.

01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:19.636 region:rollup2
I WAS INFORMED OF THE PLAN OF

01:02:17.033 --> 01:02:21.037 region:rollup2
THE DAY BEFORE THE GOVERNOR PER

01:02:19.636 --> 01:02:22.739 region:rollup2
A REVEALED HIS BUDGET.

01:02:21.037 --> 01:02:23.607 region:rollup2
AND THE GOVERNOR'S STAFF CAME TO

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:25.609 region:rollup2
GIVE ME A HEADS UP.

01:02:23.607 --> 01:02:26.176 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:02:25.609 --> 01:02:27.811 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR WAS PROPOSED IN

01:02:26.176 --> 01:02:29.813 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:02:27.811 --> 01:02:32.148 region:rollup2
I WAS SKEPTICAL THAT.

01:02:29.813 --> 01:02:34.818 region:rollup2
BUT AFTER SITTING HERE AND

01:02:32.148 --> 01:02:37.320 region:rollup2
LISTENING TO THE PRESENTATION I

01:02:34.818 --> 01:02:39.489 region:rollup2
HAVE TO HONESTLY SAY THAT I HAVE

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:41.458 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE SKEPTICAL NOW. THAN I

01:02:39.489 --> 01:02:43.660 region:rollup2
WAS WHEN I FIRST HEARD.

01:02:41.458 --> 01:02:45.228 region:rollup2
I I PRIDE MYSELF ON BEING AN

01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:48.131 region:rollup2
EDUCATOR.

01:02:45.228 --> 01:02:51.134 region:rollup2
AN EDUCATOR FOR THIRTY FOUR

01:02:48.131 --> 01:02:54.004 region:rollup2
YEARS IN THE CLASSROOM.

01:02:51.134 --> 01:02:55.405 region:rollup2
AND I TURNED TO MY COLLEAGUE WHO

01:02:54.004 --> 01:02:59.075 region:rollup2
SHARED MY EXPERIENCE OF BEING A

01:02:55.405 --> 01:02:59.843 region:rollup2

YOU KNOW.

01:03:02.145 --> 01:03:06.216 region:rollup2
I DON'T CONSIDER MYSELF AN

01:03:04.114 --> 01:03:08.051 region:rollup2
EXPERT IN MUCH.

01:03:06.216 --> 01:03:09.252 region:rollup2
AND A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT I

LEGISLATURE HAVE TO DO WITH MANY

01:03:11.221 --> 01:03:15.191 region:rollup2
OTHER THINGS THAT I KNOW A LOT

01:03:12.622 --> 01:03:16.626 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

01:03:15.191 --> 01:03:18.094 region:rollup2

TO TRY TO FIND OUT ABOUT THOSE

01:03:18.094 --> 01:03:22.565 region:rollup2
ISSUES.

01:03:19.996 --> 01:03:24.768 region:rollup2
KNOW WHETHER THEY BE WATER.

01:03:22.565 --> 01:03:26.703 region:rollup2

WHERE I FEEL THAT I'M

01:03:29.839 --> 01:03:34.878 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGEABLE? IN THAT.

01:03:32.709 --> 01:03:35.378 region:rollup2
BUT IN EDUCATION HAVING SPENT

01:03:34.878 --> 01:03:37.447 region:rollup2
THIRTY FOUR YEARS IN THE

BOARD. I DO FEEL I KNOW A

01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:50.760 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT ABOUT EDUCATION.

01:03:49.225 --> 01:03:52.996 region:rollup2
I SHARE WITH THE COMMUNITY

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:55.699 region:rollup2
COLLEGE SYSTEM.

01:03:52.996 --> 01:03:58.435 region:rollup2
THE SENSE OF URGENCY.

01:03:55.699 --> 01:04:01.137 region:rollup2
TO REACH US STUDENTS PERHAPS OR

01:03:58.435 --> 01:04:02.639 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS IN THE WORKPLACE.

01:04:01.137 --> 01:04:04.607 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE NOT BENEFITED FROM?

01:04:04.607 --> 01:04:08.478 region:rollup2
THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM.

01:04:06.409 --> 01:04:10.146 region:rollup2
THE BEST THAT THEY COULD.

01:04:08.478 --> 01:04:12.615 region:rollup2
OR DID THE BEST THAT THEY CAN.

01:04:10.146 --> 01:04:13.783 region:rollup2
OR SHORT. IN A SYSTEM.

01:04:12.615 --> 01:04:15.418 region:rollup2
THAT IS DESIGNED TO TRY TO HELP

01:04:13.783 --> 01:04:17.187 region:rollup2
OTHERS.

01:04:15.418 --> 01:04:19.089 region:rollup2
BUT I SEE IN FRONT OF THOSE.

01:04:17.187 --> 01:04:21.057 region:rollup2
AND IDEA.

01:04:19.089 --> 01:04:22.659 region:rollup2
WHO? EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE IN

SHOW ME. THAT IT IS BEEN

01:04:25.161 --> 01:04:29.833 region:rollup2
THOROUGHLY THOUGHT OUT.

01:04:27.263 --> 01:04:31.634 region:rollup2
AT ALL.

01:04:29.833 --> 01:04:34.370 region:rollup2
AND I TAKE TO HEART.

01:04:31.634 --> 01:04:36.172 region:rollup2
WOULD THE L. A. O.. OF BRINGS

01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:37.640 region:rollup2
HERE THAT THIS IS NOT LOOKING AT

01:04:36.172 --> 01:04:39.042 region:rollup2
THE ROOT CAUSES.

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:40.443 region:rollup2
THE DO YOU KNOW WHY WHY IS IT

01:04:39.042 --> 01:04:41.111 region:rollup2
THAT THESE TWO AND A HALF

01:04:40.443 --> 01:04:42.879 region:rollup2
MILLION.

ADULTS IN THE WORKPLACE HAVEN'T

01:04:47.117 --> 01:04:49.252 region:rollup2
BEEN ABLE TO BETTER. MAKE USE

01:04:47.717 --> 01:04:50.820 region:rollup2
OF.

01:04:49.252 --> 01:04:51.554 region:rollup2
.

01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:53.723 region:rollup2
THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM NOW IN

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:54.924 region:rollup2
PLACE.

01:04:53.723 --> 01:04:58.094 region:rollup2
THE IDEA OF BEGINNING FROM

01:04:54.924 --> 01:04:58.528 region:rollup2
SCRATCH.

01:04:58.094 --> 01:04:59.195 region:rollup2
FROM BEGINNING FROM.

01:04:58.528 --> 01:05:01.297 region:rollup2
.

01:04:59.195 --> 01:05:03.333 region:rollup2
NOT.

01:05:01.297 --> 01:05:04.734 region:rollup2
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF HER OF THE

01:05:03.333 --> 01:05:06.202 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN COLLEGES

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:09.005 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE ALREADY.

01:05:06.202 --> 01:05:09.839 region:rollup2

.

01:05:12.142 --> 01:05:17.046 region:rollup2
I SEE. NO EVIDENCE STILL THAT

01:05:15.678 --> 01:05:18.314 region:rollup2
THIS METHOD WOULD BE THE BEST

01:05:17.046 --> 01:05:20.316 region:rollup2
METHOD.

01:05:18.314 --> 01:05:22.452 region:rollup2
TO TO BRING THESE.

01:05:20.316 --> 01:05:25.455 region:rollup2
TWO HUNDRED FIVE MILLION

01:05:22.452 --> 01:05:27.123 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS UP I DON'T SEE ANY

01:05:25.455 --> 01:05:28.625 region:rollup2
COLLABORATION YOU'RE WITH

01:05:27.123 --> 01:05:29.325 region:rollup2

WORKPLACE.

01:05:35.031 --> 01:05:38.802 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT.

01:05:36.1000 --> 01:05:41.404 region:rollup2
STRUCTURES THAT ARE THERE.

01:05:38.802 --> 01:05:42.705 region:rollup2
SO I I.

01:05:41.404 --> 01:05:44.874 region:rollup2
YOU NO LOOK FORWARD TO MORE

01:05:42.705 --> 01:05:47.110 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS BY MY OWN COLLEAGUES

BUT I DO NOT SEE EVIDENCE.

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:51.981 region:rollup2
THAT THIS REALLY.

01:05:49.145 --> 01:05:53.283 region:rollup2
WOULD DO WHAT WE WANTED TO DO.

01:05:51.981 --> 01:05:55.385 region:rollup2
I DON'T.

I'M I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO MORE

01:06:14.904 --> 01:06:21.277 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS AND.

01:06:15.738 --> 01:06:23.046 region:rollup2
HEARING MORE.

01:06:32.455 --> 01:06:34.290 region:rollup2
PROBABLY THERE'S LOTS OF PEOPLE

01:06:33.389 --> 01:06:35.758 region:rollup2
WHO ARE SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE

01:06:34.290 --> 01:06:37.494 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL THAT YOU'RE MAKING AND

01:06:40.463 --> 01:06:43.099 region:rollup2
VERY LITTLE MEAT ON THE BONES

01:06:41.431 --> 01:06:44.334 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW AND I APPRECIATE

01:06:43.099 --> 01:06:45.935 region:rollup2
HAVING THE OVERVIEW BUT THAT'S

01:06:44.334 --> 01:06:48.638 region:rollup2
JUST WHAT IT IS A SIN IT'S AN

01:06:45.935 --> 01:06:50.907 region:rollup2
OVERVIEW SO I I LOOK FORWARD TO.

01:06:48.638 --> 01:06:51.474 region:rollup2
RECEIVING MORE DETAIL AND MORE

01:06:50.907 --> 01:06:53.343 region:rollup2
INFORMATION.

01:06:51.474 --> 01:06:55.345 region:rollup2
.

01:06:53.343 --> 01:06:57.514 region:rollup2
PRIOR TO OUR.

01:06:55.345 --> 01:07:01.351 region:rollup2
HAVING TO VOTE ON WHETHER TO

01:06:57.514 --> 01:07:03.386 region:rollup2
MOVE THIS FORWARD OR NOT.

01:07:01.351 --> 01:07:05.221 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF THAT BACK QUESTIONS I

01:07:03.386 --> 01:07:06.756 region:rollup2
HAVE A AT NIGHT I THINK.

01:07:05.221 --> 01:07:07.423 region:rollup2
YOU DIDN'T PUT IT EXACTLY THIS

01:07:06.756 --> 01:07:09.859 region:rollup2
WAY BUT.

01:07:07.423 --> 01:07:13.229 region:rollup2
AT LEAST SOME OF THE FOCUS A.

01:07:09.859 --> 01:07:15.131 region:rollup2
ON THIS HAT ADDRESSES ARE ISSUE

01:07:13.229 --> 01:07:16.966 region:rollup2
OF INCOME OR IS INTENDED TO

01:07:15.131 --> 01:07:19.469 region:rollup2
ADDRESS OUR ISSUE OF INCOME

01:07:16.966 --> 01:07:22.238 region:rollup2
INEQUALITY THAT IS GROWING IN

01:07:19.469 --> 01:07:24.941 region:rollup2
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO. IF

01:07:22.238 --> 01:07:27.076 region:rollup2
WE ARE REACHING OUT TO THAT

01:07:24.941 --> 01:07:29.445 region:rollup2
COHORT THAT TO THAT SADLY VERY

01:07:27.076 --> 01:07:32.048 region:rollup2
LARGE COHORT OF CALIFORNIANS WHO

01:07:29.445 --> 01:07:33.449 region:rollup2
FALL INTO THE LOWER INCOME.

01:07:32.048 --> 01:07:35.418 region:rollup2
CATEGORIES.

01:07:33.449 --> 01:07:39.122 region:rollup2
HOW ARE WE GOING TO ASSURE FOR

01:07:35.418 --> 01:07:41.324 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THAT THOSE FOLKS HAVE

01:07:39.122 --> 01:07:43.326 region:rollup2
BASIC CA BASELINE? A KEYBOARD

01:07:41.324 --> 01:07:44.494 region:rollup2
COMPETENCY I'M SO THAT THEY CAN

01:07:43.326 --> 01:07:45.728 region:rollup2
AVAIL THEMSELVES OF A PROGRAM

01:07:44.494 --> 01:07:47.697 region:rollup2
LIKE THIS.

01:07:45.728 --> 01:07:51.601 region:rollup2
HOW WILL THEY AVAIL THEMSELVES

01:07:47.697 --> 01:07:52.568 region:rollup2
OF EQUIPMENT THAT IS UP TO THE

01:07:51.601 --> 01:07:54.304 region:rollup2
TO THE CHALLENGE AND A?

01:07:52.568 --> 01:07:56.439 region:rollup2
?

01:07:54.304 --> 01:07:58.107 region:rollup2
THE INTERNET CONNECTION WHICH I

01:07:56.439 --> 01:08:00.043 region:rollup2
PRESUME NEEDS TO BE HIGH SPEED

01:07:58.107 --> 01:08:00.910 region:rollup2
UP THAT IS NOT AVAILABLE.

01:08:00.043 --> 01:08:03.079 region:rollup2
A.

01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:06.382 region:rollup2
AS BROADLY AS WE WOULD LIKE TO

01:08:03.079 --> 01:08:08.551 region:rollup2
LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS.

01:08:06.382 --> 01:08:09.152 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU

01:08:08.551 --> 01:08:11.888 region:rollup2
AT SOME POINT IN THIS PROCESS

01:08:09.152 --> 01:08:14.958 region:rollup2
TO.

01:08:11.888 --> 01:08:17.860 region:rollup2
POINT TO THE TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY

01:08:14.958 --> 01:08:20.163 region:rollup2
THAT YOU ARE LOOKING TO

01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:22.231 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT AND DEMONSTRATED FOR

01:08:20.163 --> 01:08:22.999 region:rollup2
US SO THAT WE UNDERSTAND IT. I

01:08:22.231 --> 01:08:25.535 region:rollup2
HAVE A.

01:08:22.999 --> 01:08:28.404 region:rollup2
FAIRLY SIMPLISTIC.

01:08:25.535 --> 01:08:30.106 region:rollup2
FRANKLY UNDERSTANDING OF ONLINE

01:08:28.404 --> 01:08:30.673 region:rollup2
LEARNING AND WHAT IT MEANS PART

01:08:30.106 --> 01:08:32.675 region:rollup2
OF IT'S BASED ON WATCHING MY

01:08:30.673 --> 01:08:34.777 region:rollup2
SON.

01:08:32.675 --> 01:08:37.280 region:rollup2
TAKE A PARAMEDIC COURSE.

01:08:34.777 --> 01:08:39.582 region:rollup2
OUT OF UCLA FOR HIM WAS VERY

01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:40.617 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE. BUT THAT LEADS ME TO

01:08:39.582 --> 01:08:42.352 region:rollup2
ANOTHER QUESTION.

01:08:40.617 --> 01:08:44.721 region:rollup2
.

01:08:42.352 --> 01:08:47.724 region:rollup2
IN THAT COURSE AND I AM QUITE

01:08:44.721 --> 01:08:49.559 region:rollup2
CERTAIN AND. MANY COURSES THAT

01:08:47.724 --> 01:08:50.994 region:rollup2
ARE TEACHING SKILLS TRAINING.

01:08:49.559 --> 01:08:53.830 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THE TRAINING IS HANDS

01:08:50.994 --> 01:08:56.532 region:rollup2
ON YOU SIMPLY CAN'T DO IT AND IN

01:08:53.830 --> 01:08:57.600 region:rollup2
FRONT OF A MONITOR YOU NEED. AND

01:08:56.532 --> 01:09:00.203 region:rollup2
HIS CASE HE NEEDS TO BE IN FRONT

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:02.138 region:rollup2
OF A. CADAVER FOR SOME OF THE.

01:09:00.203 --> 01:09:03.239 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE WORK THAT THAT SOME

01:09:02.138 --> 01:09:05.241 region:rollup2
OF THE LEARNING THAT THEY DO AND

01:09:03.239 --> 01:09:07.477 region:rollup2
IF YOUR ON TEACHING SKILLS IN

01:09:05.241 --> 01:09:09.512 region:rollup2
THE IN THE TRADES YOU HAVE TO BE

01:09:07.477 --> 01:09:11.648 region:rollup2
ABLE TO. PUT YOUR HANDS ON THE

01:09:09.512 --> 01:09:13.049 region:rollup2
TOOLS AND LEARN HOW TO

01:09:11.648 --> 01:09:15.351 region:rollup2
MANIPULATE THEM OR.

01:09:13.049 --> 01:09:17.020 region:rollup2
WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE YOU'RE

01:09:15.351 --> 01:09:19.522 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TRAINING FOR SO HOW DO

01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:21.224 region:rollup2
YOU ACCOMPLISH THAT GOAL THE OUT

01:09:19.522 --> 01:09:22.525 region:rollup2
THE LAST QUESTION I HAVE AND I

01:09:21.224 --> 01:09:24.761 region:rollup2
REALLY WOULD LIKE TO INVITE YOU

01:09:22.525 --> 01:09:27.363 region:rollup2
TO COME BY. MY OFFICE SO WE CAN.

01:09:24.761 --> 01:09:27.997 region:rollup2
I DIG A LITTLE DEEPER INTO SOME

01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:28.664 region:rollup2
OF THESE QUESTIONS AND OTHERS.

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:31.300 region:rollup2
I'M.

01:09:28.664 --> 01:09:33.236 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:35.471 region:rollup2
IF FATHER AND I I.

01:09:33.236 --> 01:09:36.939 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK THERE'S SIR OF

01:09:35.471 --> 01:09:38.574 region:rollup2
A QUESTION THAT TO IT IS WHAT

01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:40.410 region:rollup2
YOU INTEND IF IF THIS IS

01:09:38.574 --> 01:09:42.045 region:rollup2
INTENDED TO BE. A BULWARK

01:09:40.410 --> 01:09:44.614 region:rollup2
AGAINST THE NEXT RECESSION AND

01:09:42.045 --> 01:09:47.417 region:rollup2
FUTURE RECESSIONS TWENTY TWENTY

01:09:44.614 --> 01:09:49.285 region:rollup2
FIVE SEEMS A LONG WAY OFF GIVEN

01:09:47.417 --> 01:09:51.421 region:rollup2
THAT MANY OF THE ECONOMIC CA.

01:09:49.285 --> 01:09:52.955 region:rollup2
ANALYSES THAT FTA A THAT I'VE

01:09:51.421 --> 01:09:54.457 region:rollup2
SEEN AND SO.

01:09:52.955 --> 01:09:57.393 region:rollup2
.

01:09:54.457 --> 01:09:58.828 region:rollup2
WHY WILL IT TAKE THAT LONG?

01:09:57.393 --> 01:10:00.797 region:rollup2
AND MAYBE I MISUNDERSTOOD DUH

01:09:58.828 --> 01:10:02.999 region:rollup2
THE OF THE TIME THE TIMELINE

01:10:00.797 --> 01:10:05.301 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING. BUT DE A

01:10:02.999 --> 01:10:08.071 region:rollup2
SEVEN YEAR.

01:10:05.301 --> 01:10:10.173 region:rollup2
RUN UP SOUNDS LIKE A VERY LONG.

01:10:08.071 --> 01:10:11.708 region:rollup2
TIME TO ME.

01:10:10.173 --> 01:10:14.277 region:rollup2
I I THINK SOME OF THE.

01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:16.779 region:rollup2
UNDERLYING.

01:10:14.277 --> 01:10:18.414 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC GOALS I ONE OF AYE AYE

01:10:16.779 --> 01:10:18.981 region:rollup2
ONE UNDERSTAND.

01:10:18.414 --> 01:10:21.684 region:rollup2
BETTER.

01:10:18.981 --> 01:10:21.884 region:rollup2
AND I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT

01:10:21.684 --> 01:10:24.353 region:rollup2
BUT I.

01:10:21.884 --> 01:10:26.722 region:rollup2
.

01:10:24.353 --> 01:10:28.691 region:rollup2
I I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT

01:10:26.722 --> 01:10:30.259 region:rollup2
THING WE CAN DO WITH A PROGRAM

01:10:28.691 --> 01:10:32.662 region:rollup2
LIKE THIS. IS.

01:10:30.259 --> 01:10:35.531 region:rollup2
.

01:10:32.662 --> 01:10:38.701 region:rollup2
TEACH SKILLS OUTSIDE THAT ARE

01:10:35.531 --> 01:10:39.302 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED AS BEING. IN SHORT

01:10:38.701 --> 01:10:41.938 region:rollup2
SUPPLY IN THE STATE AND MATCH

01:10:39.302 --> 01:10:43.906 region:rollup2
UP.

01:10:41.938 --> 01:10:46.609 region:rollup2
THE APPROPRIATE INDIVIDUALS TO

01:10:43.906 --> 01:10:49.579 region:rollup2
FILL THOSE JOBS RAISING.

01:10:46.609 --> 01:10:50.980 region:rollup2
OF THEM IN THE ECONOMY AND

01:10:49.579 --> 01:10:54.083 region:rollup2
THEIR INCOME CAPACITY.

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:55.051 region:rollup2
I IN THE PROCESS.

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:59.455 region:rollup2
I DID HAVE ONE OTHER.

01:10:55.051 --> 01:11:01.357 region:rollup2
.

01:10:59.455 --> 01:11:03.993 region:rollup2
QUESTION ABOUT.

01:11:01.357 --> 01:11:05.161 region:rollup2
HOW YOU'LL MEASURE? OF SUCCESS

01:11:03.993 --> 01:11:06.629 region:rollup2
AND YOU SAID THAT TO.

01:11:05.161 --> 01:11:08.664 region:rollup2
.

01:11:06.629 --> 01:11:12.769 region:rollup2
THAT WAS BY MEASURING WHETHER OR

01:11:08.664 --> 01:11:16.973 region:rollup2
NOT OF PEOPLE HAVE WAGE GAINS.

01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:19.642 region:rollup2
I I COULD SEE THAT AS A MACRO

01:11:16.973 --> 01:11:21.477 region:rollup2
MEASUREMENTS BUT NOT AS A MICRO

01:11:19.642 --> 01:11:24.013 region:rollup2
MEASUREMENT FOR. IT THE

01:11:21.477 --> 01:11:26.015 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED HERE I

01:11:24.013 --> 01:11:28.384 region:rollup2
DON'T SEE HOW YOU YOU'RE ABLE TO

01:11:26.015 --> 01:11:30.052 region:rollup2
ONE INDIVIDUALIZED BASIS REALLY.

01:11:28.384 --> 01:11:31.788 region:rollup2
MEASURE THAT TO ME IT'S THE

01:11:30.052 --> 01:11:34.157 region:rollup2
ACQUISITION OF.

01:11:31.788 --> 01:11:35.758 region:rollup2
A OF SKILLS.

01:11:34.157 --> 01:11:36.726 region:rollup2
.

01:11:35.758 --> 01:11:38.060 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE KNOW THAT THE

01:11:36.726 --> 01:11:40.029 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL WAS ACTUALLY ACQUIRED

01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:41.531 region:rollup2
SKILLS THROUGH.

01:11:40.029 --> 01:11:43.032 region:rollup2
SOME KIND OF TESTING CA A

01:11:41.531 --> 01:11:44.600 region:rollup2
PROTOCOL WHETHER THAT'S ON THE

01:11:43.032 --> 01:11:45.835 region:rollup2
JOB OR.

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:47.503 region:rollup2
OR OR THROUGH TRADITIONAL

01:11:45.835 --> 01:11:47.737 region:rollup2
TESTING.

01:11:47.503 --> 01:11:49.972 region:rollup2
AND IT.

01:11:47.737 --> 01:11:51.007 region:rollup2
.

01:11:49.972 --> 01:11:52.642 region:rollup2
OR MAYBE THROUGHOUT THE FACT IS

01:11:51.007 --> 01:11:54.977 region:rollup2
THAT THOSE THOSE ARE THAT THE

01:11:52.642 --> 01:11:57.680 region:rollup2
ISSUES AND QUESTIONS THAT.

01:11:54.977 --> 01:12:00.049 region:rollup2
THAT I HAVE TODAY.

01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:00.683 region:rollup2

FUTURE I THINK GOD JUST PUTTING

01:12:13.763 --> 01:12:16.933 region:rollup2
THE QUESTIONS OUT THERE RIGHT

01:12:14.831 --> 01:12:18.367 region:rollup2
NOW I THINK WE'RE VERY EARLY IN

01:12:16.933 --> 01:12:21.170 region:rollup2

THAT K. TWELVE ACHIEVEMENT GAP

01:12:32.882 --> 01:12:36.185 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO BEYOND THE KEY TWELVE

01:12:35.284 --> 01:12:37.787 region:rollup2
ACHIEVEMENT GAP WHICH CALIFORNIA

01:12:55.638 --> 01:12:59.108 region:rollup2
OF MY CONCERNS.

01:13:02.078 --> 01:13:05.081 region:rollup2
I THINK WE ARE. IF WE ARE TO

01:13:03.779 --> 01:13:06.048 region:rollup2
VOTE IN SUPPORT OF THIS I THINK

01:13:05.081 --> 01:13:07.316 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF FAITH BECAUSE

01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:08.551 region:rollup2
AGAIN I I JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE

01:13:07.316 --> 01:13:10.286 region:rollup2
THIS IS GOING OR WHERE CAN END

01:13:08.551 --> 01:13:12.021 region:rollup2
UP. I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE

01:13:10.286 --> 01:13:13.556 region:rollup2
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.

01:13:12.021 --> 01:13:15.424 region:rollup2
I'M COMPETITION BECAME A GOOD

01:13:13.556 --> 01:13:16.092 region:rollup2
COMPETITION CANNOT BE GOOD I

01:13:15.424 --> 01:13:18.895 region:rollup2
MEAN IF COMPETITION IS.

01:13:16.092 --> 01:13:19.962 region:rollup2
I'D I SERVE STUDENTS THE BEST

01:13:18.895 --> 01:13:21.864 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOOD OF ITS COMPETITION

01:13:19.962 --> 01:13:23.232 region:rollup2
FOR RESOURCES THAT'S NOT GOOD

01:13:21.864 --> 01:13:25.201 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY WONDER WHERE WE GO

01:13:23.232 --> 01:13:26.769 region:rollup2
DOWN THE ROAD. WHERE WHERE DOES

01:13:25.201 --> 01:13:27.837 region:rollup2
THIS END UP I MEAN WHO WILL

01:13:26.769 --> 01:13:29.138 region:rollup2
TEACH THESE CLASSES?

01:13:27.837 --> 01:13:30.473 region:rollup2
IS THE YOU KNOW YOU SAID NO

01:13:29.138 --> 01:13:31.440 region:rollup2
PRIVATIZATION I MEAN THERE'S NOT

01:13:30.473 --> 01:13:33.142 region:rollup2
GOOD SOME PRIVATE OPERATOR IN

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:34.243 region:rollup2
TEXAS.

01:13:33.142 --> 01:13:35.478 region:rollup2
SOMEONE IN A ROOM OPERATING A

01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:36.746 region:rollup2
COMPUTER.

01:13:35.478 --> 01:13:38.214 region:rollup2
A BODY WHATEVER THEY CAUGHT

01:13:36.746 --> 01:13:40.082 region:rollup2
NOWADAYS RIGHT.

01:13:38.214 --> 01:13:42.151 region:rollup2
TEACHING A CLASS UNTIL WE THAT

01:13:40.082 --> 01:13:43.252 region:rollup2
CONCERNS ME BECAUSE I WANT SOME

01:13:42.151 --> 01:13:44.620 region:rollup2
IS CONNECTED TO THE STATE.

01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:46.856 region:rollup2
AND CONNECTED TO SERVING THE

01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:49.325 region:rollup2
STUDENTS SO SO YOU MEAN A ANY

01:13:46.856 --> 01:13:50.660 region:rollup2
CAN YOU COLONIES KNOWER OR NOT

01:13:49.325 --> 01:13:52.395 region:rollup2
I'M NOT SO CONCERNED ABOUT THAT.

01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:53.162 region:rollup2
SWITCHED I THINK THESE ARE THESE

01:13:52.395 --> 01:13:54.797 region:rollup2
ARE THE KIND OF THINGS WE TALK

01:13:53.162 --> 01:13:57.233 region:rollup2
QUITE. A TALK ABOUT THIS HUNDRED

01:13:54.797 --> 01:13:58.701 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN COLLEGE SERVING ON. THE

01:13:57.233 --> 01:13:59.702 region:rollup2
SKILLS GAP.

01:13:58.701 --> 01:14:01.270 region:rollup2
SO DOES THAT MEAN IT WOULD ONLY

01:13:59.702 --> 01:14:02.571 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON THE SKILLS GAP OR WOULD

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:04.607 region:rollup2
IT TO GO INTO TEACHING GENERAL

01:14:02.571 --> 01:14:05.074 region:rollup2
EDUCATION CLASSES.

01:14:04.607 --> 01:14:07.443 region:rollup2
NO IS THAT WHERE THIS

01:14:05.074 --> 01:14:08.544 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY.

01:14:07.443 --> 01:14:09.879 region:rollup2
COULD ADD UP IS THAT BEEN

01:14:08.544 --> 01:14:11.147 region:rollup2
CONTEMPLATED.

01:14:09.879 --> 01:14:12.014 region:rollup2
IS THERE SOME WALLED SET UP TO

01:14:11.147 --> 01:14:13.416 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN

01:14:12.014 --> 01:14:15.017 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAPPEN.

01:14:13.416 --> 01:14:16.886 region:rollup2
SO THOSE ARE JUST THE KIND OF

01:14:15.017 --> 01:14:18.854 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT I WORRY ABOUT WHERE

01:14:16.886 --> 01:14:20.456 region:rollup2
DOES THIS GO. BUSINESS AND THE

01:14:18.854 --> 01:14:22.058 region:rollup2
AND BECOME THE BIGGEST COLLEGE

01:14:20.456 --> 01:14:23.693 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW TAKE STUDENTS FROM

01:14:22.058 --> 01:14:25.361 region:rollup2
OTHER COLLEGES WERE JUST PICK

01:14:23.693 --> 01:14:27.096 region:rollup2
SOMEONE BIG ONLINE SYSTEM WHEN

01:14:25.361 --> 01:14:27.797 region:rollup2
GUINNESS AND THEN SHARED. HERE I

01:14:27.096 --> 01:14:29.465 region:rollup2
THINK.

01:14:27.797 --> 01:14:30.533 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT TO BE SAID TO TO

01:14:29.465 --> 01:14:32.034 region:rollup2
TO EXPERIENCE AN INSTRUCTOR

01:14:30.533 --> 01:14:33.703 region:rollup2
FIRSTHAND AND IN CONDUCTING

01:14:32.034 --> 01:14:35.438 region:rollup2
HANDS ON LEARNING.

01:14:33.703 --> 01:14:37.039 region:rollup2
SO WITH THAT ALL OF THE QUITE

01:14:35.438 --> 01:14:37.673 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAIR IF YOU WANT TO

01:14:37.039 --> 01:14:39.475 region:rollup2

TWO IN TERMS OF COMPETITION.

01:15:23.786 --> 01:15:27.123 region:rollup2
THE.

PLATFORM IS FOCUSED ON MICRO

01:15:28.891 --> 01:15:32.895 region:rollup2
PRETENSIONS.

JOB SKILLS.

01:15:32.895 --> 01:15:36.265 region:rollup2
WE ALREADY HAVE THE ONLINE

01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:38.501 region:rollup2
EDUCATION INITIATIVE

01:15:36.265 --> 01:15:40.903 region:rollup2

ONLINE CONTENT AND AND MAKING IT

01:15:42.638 --> 01:15:45.574 region:rollup2

CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THAT.

01:15:45.574 --> 01:15:48.210 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS SUPPORTED THROUGH A

01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:48.811 region:rollup2
PROCESS OF.

01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:51.280 region:rollup2
A PARTNERING WITH THE HUNDRED

01:15:48.811 --> 01:15:51.747 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN.

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:53.682 region:rollup2
SO.

01:15:51.747 --> 01:15:55.851 region:rollup2
I RECOGNIZE

01:15:53.682 --> 01:15:57.219 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IS SOMETHING NEW

01:15:55.851 --> 01:15:58.154 region:rollup2
OF SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN

01:15:57.219 --> 01:15:59.922 region:rollup2
CONTEMPLATED BEFORE.

01:15:58.154 --> 01:16:01.957 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:15:59.922 --> 01:16:04.493 region:rollup2
I JUST ADDS IF YOU LOOK AT THE

01:16:01.957 --> 01:16:06.929 region:rollup2
DATA FOR ONLINE COURSES IN THE

01:16:04.493 --> 01:16:08.964 region:rollup2

01:16:06.929 --> 01:16:10.065 region:rollup2
ITIS GROWING MORE RAPIDLY THE

01:16:08.964 --> 01:16:11.767 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF UNITS STUDENTS ARE

01:16:10.065 --> 01:16:13.169 region:rollup2
TAKING ONLINE.

01:16:11.767 --> 01:16:14.537 region:rollup2
IS OUT PACING THE NUMBER OF

01:16:13.169 --> 01:16:16.872 region:rollup2
UNITS STUDENTS ARE TAKING IN A

01:16:14.537 --> 01:16:18.274 region:rollup2
BRICK AND MORTAR.

01:16:16.872 --> 01:16:20.409 region:rollup2
AND WILL SURPASS THAT IN THE

01:16:18.274 --> 01:16:22.111 region:rollup2
NOT TOO DISTANT.

01:16:20.409 --> 01:16:23.379 region:rollup2
SO WHETHER OR NOT WE CREATE

01:16:22.111 --> 01:16:25.448 region:rollup2
SOMETHING HERE

01:16:23.379 --> 01:16:27.817 region:rollup2

WE RECOGNIZE.

01:16:36.392 --> 01:16:40.329 region:rollup2
THAT IN A COMPETENCY BASED MODEL

01:16:38.928 --> 01:16:43.165 region:rollup2
SOME OF THOSE COMPETENCIES ARE

01:16:40.329 --> 01:16:44.867 region:rollup2
ARE ARE MEASURED BASED ON. THE

01:16:43.165 --> 01:16:46.368 region:rollup2
STUDENT'S ABILITY TO MASTER THE

01:16:44.867 --> 01:16:47.770 region:rollup2
CONTENT ONLINE.

01:16:46.368 --> 01:16:49.672 region:rollup2
OR IN A PERSONALIZED LEARNING

01:16:47.770 --> 01:16:52.241 region:rollup2
PLATFORM SOME OF IT HAS TO BE

01:16:49.672 --> 01:16:53.409 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATED HANDS ON.

01:16:52.241 --> 01:16:53.943 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY WE ARE BUILDING THE

01:16:53.409 --> 01:16:56.278 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIPS

01:16:53.943 --> 01:16:59.248 region:rollup2
NOW.

01:16:56.278 --> 01:17:00.115 region:rollup2
BETWEEN LABOR. AND YOU KNOW I

01:16:59.248 --> 01:17:01.317 region:rollup2
WON'T SPEAK FOR THEM THEY CAN

01:17:00.115 --> 01:17:02.551 region:rollup2
SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES BUT THERE

01:17:01.317 --> 01:17:04.386 region:rollup2
IS A NEED.

01:17:02.551 --> 01:17:06.722 region:rollup2
WITH EMPLOYERS.

01:17:04.386 --> 01:17:07.256 region:rollup2
AND SO WE SAID WE PUT IN FRONT

01:17:06.722 --> 01:17:08.090 region:rollup2
OF YOUR YOUR.

01:17:07.256 --> 01:17:09.191 region:rollup2
.

01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:11.193 region:rollup2
.

01:17:09.191 --> 01:17:13.095 region:rollup2
SEATS.

01:17:11.193 --> 01:17:14.663 region:rollup2
A LIST OF VARIOUS EVENTS WITH

01:17:13.095 --> 01:17:16.832 region:rollup2
THE DIFFERENT PARTNERS THAT WERE

01:17:14.663 --> 01:17:19.301 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH TO THINK THROUGH

01:17:16.832 --> 01:17:21.036 region:rollup2
AND DESIGNED THESE PATHWAYS.

01:17:19.301 --> 01:17:22.705 region:rollup2
THESE PATHWAYS ARE ALREADY IN

01:17:21.036 --> 01:17:24.640 region:rollup2
MANY CASES BEING TAUGHT TODAY

01:17:22.705 --> 01:17:25.708 region:rollup2
JUST ON A SMALLER SCALE.

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:27.076 region:rollup2
OF FOR EXAMPLE HERE IN

01:17:25.708 --> 01:17:28.544 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO AT CI YOU ONE

01:17:27.076 --> 01:17:29.845 region:rollup2
THOUSAND IS CREATED.

01:17:28.544 --> 01:17:31.413 region:rollup2
COUPLE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT

01:17:29.845 --> 01:17:33.115 region:rollup2
ARE COMPETENCY BASED THAT ALLOW

01:17:31.413 --> 01:17:34.783 region:rollup2
THEIR MEMBERS TO GAIN CERTAIN

01:17:33.115 --> 01:17:36.585 region:rollup2
SKILLS THAT ALLOW THEM

01:17:34.783 --> 01:17:38.587 region:rollup2
PROMOTIONAL OPPORTUNITIES.

01:17:36.585 --> 01:17:39.154 region:rollup2
SECURELY IN THE IT FIELD.

01:17:38.587 --> 01:17:40.456 region:rollup2
SO WE WANT TO DO WITH SCALE

01:17:39.154 --> 01:17:41.957 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:17:40.456 --> 01:17:43.726 region:rollup2
SO THIS INSTRUCTION IS HAPPENING

01:17:41.957 --> 01:17:45.294 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING BRAND NEW

01:17:43.726 --> 01:17:47.963 region:rollup2
THIS IS JUST THAT'S UP AND THAT

01:17:45.294 --> 01:17:49.431 region:rollup2
WE HAVE INTENTIONALLY. TRY TO

01:17:47.963 --> 01:17:52.401 region:rollup2
PULL TOGETHER AND WHY A NEW

01:17:49.431 --> 01:17:52.935 region:rollup2
COLLEGE.

WE HAVE A HUNDRED FOURTEEN

01:17:52.935 --> 01:17:55.638 region:rollup2

WE GOT TWO HUNDRED FOURTEEN

01:17:55.638 --> 01:17:57.973 region:rollup2
COLLEGES BECAUSE WE FELT THAT

01:17:57.239 --> 01:18:00.276 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A NEED

01:17:57.973 --> 01:18:01.744 region:rollup2
TO BE SERVED.

01:18:00.276 --> 01:18:03.546 region:rollup2
WHETHER THAT'S COASTLINE COLLEGE

01:18:01.744 --> 01:18:05.881 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THE COLLEGE WITHOUT

01:18:03.546 --> 01:18:07.483 region:rollup2
WALLS IN ORANGE COUNTY. OR THE

01:18:05.881 --> 01:18:08.551 region:rollup2
WORK THAT'S BEING DONE ON WHAT

01:18:07.483 --> 01:18:10.119 region:rollup2
WILL HOPEFULLY BE OUR NEWEST

01:18:08.551 --> 01:18:11.420 region:rollup2
COLLEGE IN MADERA.

01:18:10.119 --> 01:18:12.555 region:rollup2
THERE IS A NEAT AND THAT'S WHY

01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:14.757 region:rollup2
WE'RE.

01:18:12.555 --> 01:18:15.591 region:rollup2
WE'RE ORGANIZED ITS WAY.

01:18:14.757 --> 01:18:16.158 region:rollup2
ALL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DOING

01:18:15.591 --> 01:18:18.027 region:rollup2
SERVING ONE MORE ADDITIONAL

01:18:16.158 --> 01:18:18.260 region:rollup2
NEED.

01:18:18.027 --> 01:18:20.462 region:rollup2
AND SO.

OUR COLLEGES ARE SERVING MANY

01:21:28.917 --> 01:21:32.721 region:rollup2
MISSIONS.

01:21:31.453 --> 01:21:35.357 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOMETIMES OVERWHELMED

01:21:32.721 --> 01:21:36.658 region:rollup2
BY THE NEED IN THEIR COMMUNITY.

01:21:35.357 --> 01:21:37.226 region:rollup2
I'M WE ARE ASKING THEM TO

CONTINUOUSLY DO MORE THEN WE

01:21:37.226 --> 01:21:44.066 region:rollup2
EXPRESSED CONCERN.

01:21:43.499 --> 01:21:45.367 region:rollup2

STUDENTS.

01:21:45.367 --> 01:21:47.936 region:rollup2
AND I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE

01:21:46.602 --> 01:21:48.670 region:rollup2
THAT THE OUTCOMES OF OUR

01:21:47.936 --> 01:21:50.239 region:rollup2
STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA TO ME

01:21:48.670 --> 01:21:51.807 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YSTEM ARE NOT WHERE

01:21:50.239 --> 01:21:53.175 region:rollup2
THEY SHOULD BE. NOT WEAR ANY OF

01:21:51.807 --> 01:21:55.978 region:rollup2
US WANT TO BE THAT'S NOT A

01:21:53.175 --> 01:21:57.579 region:rollup2
CRITICISM OF OUR FACULTY OR

01:21:55.978 --> 01:21:59.314 region:rollup2
COLLEGES OR OUR STAFF.

01:21:57.579 --> 01:22:00.783 region:rollup2
AT THE CRITICISM OF HOW MUCH

01:21:59.314 --> 01:22:01.683 region:rollup2
WE'RE ASKING EACH AND EVERY.

01:22:00.783 --> 01:22:03.919 region:rollup2
OF THOSE HUNDRED FOURTEEN

01:22:01.683 --> 01:22:06.422 region:rollup2
COLLEGES TO DO.

01:22:03.919 --> 01:22:08.257 region:rollup2
SO I WANT OUR COLLEGES TO HAVE

01:22:06.422 --> 01:22:10.292 region:rollup2
THE SPACE AND THE FUNDING AND

01:22:08.257 --> 01:22:12.194 region:rollup2
THE FOCUS TO SERVE THEIR PRIMARY

01:22:10.292 --> 01:22:13.796 region:rollup2
MISSIONS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES.

01:22:12.194 --> 01:22:16.165 region:rollup2
AND TO ADD CAPACITY TO THE

01:22:13.796 --> 01:22:17.466 region:rollup2
SYSTEM BY ALLOWING FOR THIS

01:22:16.165 --> 01:22:19.802 region:rollup2
THIS NEW.

01:22:17.466 --> 01:22:20.302 region:rollup2
ENTITY.

01:22:19.802 --> 01:22:22.671 region:rollup2
TO SUPPORT THAT CAPACITY

01:22:20.302 --> 01:22:23.705 region:rollup2
BUILDING.

01:22:22.671 --> 01:22:26.809 region:rollup2
SO.

01:22:23.705 --> 01:22:28.010 region:rollup2
I THINK WE'VE HAD MANY.

01:22:26.809 --> 01:22:30.245 region:rollup2
MANY EXAMPLES THROUGHOUT.

01:22:28.010 --> 01:22:31.647 region:rollup2
.

01:22:30.245 --> 01:22:32.848 region:rollup2
OUR HISTORY THE CALIFORNIA

01:22:31.647 --> 01:22:34.616 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE COLLEGES WHERE WE'VE

01:22:32.848 --> 01:22:36.084 region:rollup2
SAID WELL LET'S JUST GIVE THE

01:22:34.616 --> 01:22:37.920 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATIVE IT'S ANOTHER.

01:22:36.084 --> 01:22:38.454 region:rollup2
TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS AND LET

01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:39.988 region:rollup2
THEM GO TAKE CARE OF THIS

01:22:38.454 --> 01:22:41.690 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

01:22:39.988 --> 01:22:42.257 region:rollup2
I THINK ADULT EDUCATE OUR DULL

01:22:41.690 --> 01:22:44.326 region:rollup2
BASIC EDUCATION IS A GREAT

01:22:42.257 --> 01:22:44.927 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE.

01:22:44.326 --> 01:22:47.596 region:rollup2
WE ALL CARE ABOUT ADULT BASIC

01:22:44.927 --> 01:22:48.230 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

01:22:47.596 --> 01:22:50.098 region:rollup2
WE PUT MONEY TOWARD A BASIC IT'S

01:22:48.230 --> 01:22:51.800 region:rollup2
GOOD.

01:22:50.098 --> 01:22:54.069 region:rollup2
I THINK VERY FEW OF US WOULD.

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:56.271 region:rollup2
ARGUE THAT ADULT BASIC EDUCATION

01:22:54.069 --> 01:22:58.841 region:rollup2
IS NOT WORKING WHY.

01:22:56.271 --> 01:23:00.576 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE CONTINUE TO PILE ON.

01:22:58.841 --> 01:23:03.512 region:rollup2
HI I WONDER HUNDRED FOURTEEN

01:23:00.576 --> 01:23:04.146 region:rollup2
COLLEGES ASKING NOT ONLY TO DEAL

01:23:03.512 --> 01:23:04.446 region:rollup2
WITH THE PIPELINE STUDENTS THAT

01:23:04.146 --> 01:23:06.615 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE.

01:23:04.446 --> 01:23:07.950 region:rollup2
TO TRY AND REACH.

01:23:06.615 --> 01:23:09.451 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CO HER STUDENT YES THEY

01:23:07.950 --> 01:23:11.253 region:rollup2
ARE VERY CAPABLE OF DOING THAT

01:23:09.451 --> 01:23:11.787 region:rollup2
BUT WORK BUT WE WANT TO DO IS

01:23:11.253 --> 01:23:13.689 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THE CAPACITY REACH

01:23:11.787 --> 01:23:14.790 region:rollup2
SCALE.

01:23:13.689 --> 01:23:15.991 region:rollup2
IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY THAN

01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:18.227 region:rollup2
WE'RE REACHING TODAY.

01:23:15.991 --> 01:23:20.128 region:rollup2
THAT IS MY CONCERN.

01:23:18.227 --> 01:23:22.898 region:rollup2
SCALE WHICH WE NEED TO REACH

01:23:20.128 --> 01:23:23.866 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO SERVE.

01:23:22.898 --> 01:23:24.566 region:rollup2
THE VERY FUNDAMENTAL NEEDS OF

01:23:23.866 --> 01:23:27.102 region:rollup2
THESE WORKERS.

01:23:24.566 --> 01:23:29.037 region:rollup2
.

01:23:27.102 --> 01:23:30.272 region:rollup2
COULD WE INVEST HUNDRED TWENTY

01:23:29.037 --> 01:23:30.839 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS IN A HUNDRED

01:23:30.272 --> 01:23:32.507 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN COLLEGES OF COURSE

01:23:30.839 --> 01:23:35.143 region:rollup2
RICK.

01:23:32.507 --> 01:23:36.678 region:rollup2
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT

01:23:35.143 --> 01:23:38.981 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT WOULD PRODUCE THE

01:23:36.678 --> 01:23:40.649 region:rollup2
RESULTS THAT WE NEED IS A STATE.

01:23:38.981 --> 01:23:41.683 region:rollup2
AS GREAT AS OUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN

01:23:40.649 --> 01:23:43.352 region:rollup2
COLLEGES ARE BECAUSE THAT MONEY

01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:44.820 region:rollup2
WILL BE DISPERSED.

01:23:43.352 --> 01:23:46.221 region:rollup2
THERE WILL BE NO CENTRAL AREA TO

01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:48.290 region:rollup2
HOLD ACCOUNTABLE.

01:23:46.221 --> 01:23:50.792 region:rollup2
AT LEAST WITH THIS.

01:23:48.290 --> 01:23:52.828 region:rollup2

01:24:16.351 --> 01:24:17.219 region:rollup2
THROUGH FIVE BUT I'M GONNA GO

01:24:16.952 --> 01:24:19.988 region:rollup2
BACK TO.

01:24:17.219 --> 01:24:21.189 region:rollup2
PAGE TWO.

01:24:19.988 --> 01:24:23.091 region:rollup2
AND WHEN YOUR COMMENTS A SAYS

01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:24.626 region:rollup2
ENROLLING IN ONLINE COURSES

01:24:23.091 --> 01:24:26.228 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE OF HOME DISTRICT IS

01:24:24.626 --> 01:24:28.163 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT.

01:24:26.228 --> 01:24:29.765 region:rollup2
STUDENTS MUST APPLY SEPARATELY

01:24:28.163 --> 01:24:31.099 region:rollup2
FOR ADMISSIONS TO EACH COLLEGE.

01:24:29.765 --> 01:24:33.302 region:rollup2
AND REGISTER FOR EACH CLASS

01:24:31.099 --> 01:24:34.336 region:rollup2
SEPARATELY.

01:24:33.302 --> 01:24:36.138 region:rollup2
THEN ON PAGE FIVE YOU GO DOWN

01:24:34.336 --> 01:24:37.973 region:rollup2
SAY.

01:24:36.138 --> 01:24:39.374 region:rollup2
THE MINISTRATION OFF DOES NOT

01:24:37.973 --> 01:24:40.375 region:rollup2
PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT WORKING

01:24:39.374 --> 01:24:41.376 region:rollup2
ADULTS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN

01:24:40.375 --> 01:24:43.178 region:rollup2
MORE.

01:24:41.376 --> 01:24:45.080 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

01:24:43.178 --> 01:24:47.749 region:rollup2
CANNOT ACCESS IT THROUGH JUSTIN

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:50.652 region:rollup2
ONLINE OR IN PERSON.

01:24:47.749 --> 01:24:51.820 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

01:24:50.652 --> 01:24:53.822 region:rollup2
SURE LIKE THOSE ARGUMENTS ARE

01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:55.457 region:rollup2
GOING AGAINST EACH OTHER THE

01:24:53.822 --> 01:24:56.358 region:rollup2
DIRECT QUESTION YOU SERVERS.

01:24:55.457 --> 01:24:58.026 region:rollup2
DO YOU THINK THAT THE

01:24:56.358 --> 01:24:59.394 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION OF THE TWO POINT

01:24:58.026 --> 01:25:00.929 region:rollup2
FIVE MILLION.

01:24:59.394 --> 01:25:02.264 region:rollup2
MEN AND WOMEN AGES TWENTY FIVE

01:25:00.929 --> 01:25:04.132 region:rollup2
TO THIRTY FOUR ARE STRANDED

01:25:02.264 --> 01:25:06.702 region:rollup2
WORKERS YOU AGREE WITH HIS

01:25:04.132 --> 01:25:07.369 region:rollup2
NUMBERS.

01:25:06.702 --> 01:25:08.637 region:rollup2
RIGHT ARE IRONIES BUT THE

01:25:07.369 --> 01:25:10.639 region:rollup2
CONCERNS THAT THE TWO POINT FIVE

01:25:08.637 --> 01:25:11.506 region:rollup2
MILLION NUMBER AT THE GOOD FAITH

01:25:10.639 --> 01:25:13.775 region:rollup2
FUND DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION.

01:25:11.506 --> 01:25:15.377 region:rollup2
SO DO YOU.

01:25:13.775 --> 01:25:17.613 region:rollup2
YOU ARE RECOGNIZED AT THERE'S.

01:25:15.377 --> 01:25:18.981 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT NEED SOME.

01:25:17.613 --> 01:25:20.615 region:rollup2
SKILLS TO BE. TERM I BELIEVE HIS

01:25:18.981 --> 01:25:22.684 region:rollup2
WAGE.

01:25:20.615 --> 01:25:23.852 region:rollup2
HAVE A WAGE GAIN.

01:25:22.684 --> 01:25:26.989 region:rollup2
YES THAT'S RIGHT.

01:25:23.852 --> 01:25:28.690 region:rollup2
SO.

01:25:26.989 --> 01:25:30.859 region:rollup2
MY QUESTION IS ANDY YOU GREED

01:25:28.690 --> 01:25:32.260 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S A NEED IS YOUR

01:25:30.859 --> 01:25:33.128 region:rollup2
ISSUE IS THAT.

01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:34.930 region:rollup2
NOT THE WHY BUT YOU HAVE A

01:25:33.128 --> 01:25:36.231 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WITH THE PROCESS AND HOW

01:25:34.930 --> 01:25:37.399 region:rollup2
EASE ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM IS

01:25:36.231 --> 01:25:39.301 region:rollup2
LIKE WELL I THINK OUR CONCERN IS

01:25:37.399 --> 01:25:41.470 region:rollup2
WE DON'T. WIRE THE TWO POINT

01:25:39.301 --> 01:25:42.137 region:rollup2
FIVE MILLION TO THAT MILLION

01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:43.872 region:rollup2
WORKERS NOT.

01:25:42.137 --> 01:25:45.707 region:rollup2
WHAT WHY HAVE THEY NOT BEEN ABLE

01:25:43.872 --> 01:25:46.942 region:rollup2
TO GET THAT POST SECONDARY AT?

01:25:45.707 --> 01:25:48.377 region:rollup2
WHAT HAVE BEEN THE BARRIER FOR

01:25:46.942 --> 01:25:49.911 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK WE DON'T? I DON'T

01:25:48.377 --> 01:25:51.079 region:rollup2
THINK THAT WE FOR ANYBODY GIVE

01:25:49.911 --> 01:25:52.948 region:rollup2
US A GOOD REASON FOR WHAT WITH

01:25:51.079 --> 01:25:54.816 region:rollup2
THAT WITH THE CASE.

01:25:52.948 --> 01:25:56.451 region:rollup2
IN IN IN GENERAL WHAT WENT ON

01:25:54.816 --> 01:25:57.786 region:rollup2
BUT ONLINE EDUCATION ISSUES

01:25:56.451 --> 01:25:58.820 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW IN IN THE COMMUTE COST

01:25:57.786 --> 01:25:59.755 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES

01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:01.223 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WHO ARE OTHER WHITE

01:25:59.755 --> 01:26:02.591 region:rollup2
HOUSE RD ENROLLED THEY'RE TAKING

01:26:01.223 --> 01:26:04.359 region:rollup2
A COURSE OR TWO.

01:26:02.591 --> 01:26:05.427 region:rollup2
TO COMPLEMENT THEIR IN PERSON

01:26:04.359 --> 01:26:07.462 region:rollup2
COURSES THEY MIGHT HELP THEM

01:26:05.427 --> 01:26:09.164 region:rollup2
WITH NOT HAVING TO COMMUTE A DAY

01:26:07.462 --> 01:26:10.098 region:rollup2
MIGHT HELP THEM WITH MAYBE THEY

01:26:09.164 --> 01:26:11.099 region:rollup2
HAVE ACCESS TO A COURSE THAT

01:26:10.098 --> 01:26:12.467 region:rollup2
THEY OTHERWISE WOULDN'T BEEN

01:26:11.099 --> 01:26:12.968 region:rollup2
ABLE TO TAKE BECAUSE THEY HAVE

01:26:12.467 --> 01:26:13.869 region:rollup2
GOT DOING CONFLICTS WITH

01:26:12.968 --> 01:26:14.736 region:rollup2
HELPING.

01:26:13.869 --> 01:26:16.338 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WHO ARE ALREADY

01:26:14.736 --> 01:26:18.540 region:rollup2
ENROLLED IN THE COLLEGE'S BE

01:26:16.338 --> 01:26:20.442 region:rollup2
ABLE TO ACCESS OTHER COURSE OF

01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:21.610 region:rollup2
THE MY HOPE DEMS DUE TO THE

01:26:20.442 --> 01:26:22.177 region:rollup2
PROFIT THAT'S A GOOD THING

01:26:21.610 --> 01:26:23.779 region:rollup2
NOTHING VISITING WRONG WITH

01:26:22.177 --> 01:26:24.513 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:26:23.779 --> 01:26:25.113 region:rollup2
I THINK ARE OUR CONCERN IS.

01:26:24.513 --> 01:26:25.714 region:rollup2
WE DON'T KNOW THAT THE REASON

01:26:25.113 --> 01:26:27.049 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THAT THAT THE TWO

01:26:25.714 --> 01:26:28.450 region:rollup2
POINT BY MILLION ADULTS ARE NOT

01:26:27.049 --> 01:26:29.951 region:rollup2
ENROLLED IN THE COLLEGE IT IS

01:26:28.450 --> 01:26:30.786 region:rollup2
BECAUSE. I

01:26:29.951 --> 01:26:32.120 region:rollup2
THE COURSES THAT WERE AVAILABLE

01:26:30.786 --> 01:26:35.390 region:rollup2
ARE NOT ARE ARE NOT.

01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:36.458 region:rollup2
WILLING TO THEM THAT THEY ARE

01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:38.727 region:rollup2
THEIR MAIN CHALLENGE IS THAT

01:26:36.458 --> 01:26:40.095 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T CAN'T GET TO A

01:26:38.727 --> 01:26:41.396 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE I MEAN IF IF

01:26:40.095 --> 01:26:44.366 region:rollup2
THAT WAS THE CASE OF ISSUE WITH

01:26:41.396 --> 01:26:45.934 region:rollup2
ACCESS I HAVE TIME TO DRIVE TO A

01:26:44.366 --> 01:26:47.302 region:rollup2
COLLEGE AND AN ONLINE PROGRAM.

01:26:45.934 --> 01:26:48.336 region:rollup2
WE WOULD WE WOULD BE OKAY

01:26:47.302 --> 01:26:50.105 region:rollup2
THINKING THAT WE MIGHT BE IN THE

01:26:48.336 --> 01:26:50.672 region:rollup2
RIGHT DIRECTION I THINK WE DON'T

01:26:50.105 --> 01:26:51.873 region:rollup2
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE REAL

01:26:50.672 --> 01:26:53.408 region:rollup2
COSTS ARE.

01:26:51.873 --> 01:26:55.010 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING FULL TIME

01:26:53.408 --> 01:26:57.112 region:rollup2
AND HAVE FAMILIES.

01:26:55.010 --> 01:26:59.214 region:rollup2
IT EVEN IF YOU CAN.

01:26:57.112 --> 01:27:00.849 region:rollup2
OPEN UP THE COMPUTER AND AND

01:26:59.214 --> 01:27:01.917 region:rollup2
TAKE A COURSE.

01:27:00.849 --> 01:27:03.952 region:rollup2
IT'S STILL DIFFICULT PICKED A

01:27:01.917 --> 01:27:05.220 region:rollup2
LOT OF YOUR TIME AND ENERGY TO

01:27:03.952 --> 01:27:06.555 region:rollup2
TAKE IT TO COURT THAT PEOPLE

01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:08.256 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE NOT BE ENROLLING

01:27:06.555 --> 01:27:09.157 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEIR LIVES ARE JUST.

01:27:08.256 --> 01:27:11.126 region:rollup2
BUT THEY HAVE A LOT GOING ON AND

01:27:09.157 --> 01:27:11.726 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO

01:27:11.126 --> 01:27:15.397 region:rollup2
ALSO TAKE THE EXTRA COURSES I

01:27:11.726 --> 01:27:16.498 region:rollup2
THINK THAT. THAT THAT ANOTHER

01:27:15.397 --> 01:27:17.399 region:rollup2
ANOTHER. POSSIBLY GOING ON I

01:27:16.498 --> 01:27:18.633 region:rollup2
THINK OUR CONCERN IS THAT WE

01:27:17.399 --> 01:27:19.935 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN TRIED IN ANY CASE TO

01:27:18.633 --> 01:27:21.770 region:rollup2
TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WHAT ARE

01:27:19.935 --> 01:27:23.872 region:rollup2
THE MAIN REASONS WHY THESE FOLKS

01:27:21.770 --> 01:27:25.507 region:rollup2
ARE NOT CURRENTLY. IN THE SYSTEM

01:27:23.872 --> 01:27:26.742 region:rollup2
AND LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THOSE

01:27:25.507 --> 01:27:28.443 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS ARE AND THEN LET'S FIX

01:27:26.742 --> 01:27:29.978 region:rollup2
THOSE PROBLEMS WE ARE WE ARE.

01:27:28.443 --> 01:27:31.279 region:rollup2
THE PROPOSAL IS HERE IS AN

01:27:29.978 --> 01:27:32.380 region:rollup2
ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE WE'RE

01:27:31.279 --> 01:27:34.816 region:rollup2
PRESUMING THAT THIS IS THE

01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:35.684 region:rollup2
SOLUTION THAT IF THEY HAVE

01:27:34.816 --> 01:27:37.586 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO THE TH.

01:27:35.684 --> 01:27:39.755 region:rollup2
TO THIS PROGRAM IN IN THEIR. IN

01:27:37.586 --> 01:27:40.589 region:rollup2
THEIR HOME THEN THEY'RE GONNA TO

01:27:39.755 --> 01:27:41.556 region:rollup2
BE ENROLLED IN ANNOUNCED ON THE

01:27:40.589 --> 01:27:42.524 region:rollup2
PATH THE BARRIER FOR MANY OF

01:27:41.556 --> 01:27:43.825 region:rollup2
THEM THEY MIGHT NOT EVEN KNOW

01:27:42.524 --> 01:27:45.894 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY WOULD WANT TO TAKE

01:27:43.825 --> 01:27:46.795 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT THEIR COURSE THEY

01:27:45.894 --> 01:27:48.096 region:rollup2
MIGHT. NEED ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE

01:27:46.795 --> 01:27:49.564 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE ALL OF THE

01:27:48.096 --> 01:27:51.366 region:rollup2
OF THE VARIETY OF PROGRAMS THAT

01:27:49.564 --> 01:27:52.534 region:rollup2
I CAN BENEFIT FROM MAYBE THAT'S

01:27:51.366 --> 01:27:53.101 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM IF THAT'S THE CASE

01:27:52.534 --> 01:27:54.736 region:rollup2
THEN MAYBE WE NEED TO FIND A

01:27:53.101 --> 01:27:56.538 region:rollup2
BETTER WAY TO SORT OF. REACH OUT

01:27:54.736 --> 01:27:58.106 region:rollup2
TO THOSE FOLKS AND AND PROVIDE

01:27:56.538 --> 01:27:58.640 region:rollup2
THEM SOME ADVICE WHEN THEY'RE

01:27:58.106 --> 01:27:59.341 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY'RE ENTERING THE

01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:00.876 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

01:27:59.341 --> 01:28:02.344 region:rollup2
THAT YOU COULD CONCEIVE OF A

01:28:00.876 --> 01:28:04.045 region:rollup2
NUMBER A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT

01:28:02.344 --> 01:28:04.513 region:rollup2
APPROACHES TO TRY TO SOLVE THIS

01:28:04.045 --> 01:28:06.681 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

01:28:04.513 --> 01:28:08.416 region:rollup2
BUT THE BUT THE WAY THE WAY YOU

01:28:06.681 --> 01:28:09.284 region:rollup2
APPROACH IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU

01:28:08.416 --> 01:28:11.019 region:rollup2
THINK THE MAIN ROUTE ISSUE.

01:28:09.284 --> 01:28:12.721 region:rollup2
SO YOUR ISSUE AS IT USED.

01:28:11.019 --> 01:28:13.922 region:rollup2
YOU RECOGNIZE THERE'S NO MAYBE A

01:28:12.721 --> 01:28:15.524 region:rollup2
NEED BUT THE SOLUTION TO TO THIS

01:28:13.922 --> 01:28:16.124 region:rollup2
NEED.

01:28:15.524 --> 01:28:17.993 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOT.

01:28:16.124 --> 01:28:19.995 region:rollup2
CONVINCED YET THAT THIS

01:28:17.993 --> 01:28:22.030 region:rollup2
SOLUTION IS

01:28:19.995 --> 01:28:24.466 region:rollup2
MITCHELL NAY LEFT IRAQ OKAY NOW

01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:24.733 region:rollup2
IN YOUR RESEARCH HAVE YOU.

01:28:24.466 --> 01:28:25.567 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT.

01:28:24.733 --> 01:28:27.002 region:rollup2
.

01:28:25.567 --> 01:28:29.104 region:rollup2
OTHER INSTITUTIONS WERE FULL

01:28:27.002 --> 01:28:30.672 region:rollup2
TIME WORKERS PEOPLE UNDER TWENTY

01:28:29.104 --> 01:28:31.273 region:rollup2
FIVE THIRTY FIVE.

01:28:30.672 --> 01:28:34.075 region:rollup2
HAVE.

01:28:31.273 --> 01:28:34.643 region:rollup2
ENGAGE IN ANY ACTIVITIES LIKE

01:28:34.075 --> 01:28:34.976 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR RESEARCH HAVE YOU

01:28:34.643 --> 01:28:37.012 region:rollup2
SEEN.

01:28:34.976 --> 01:28:37.846 region:rollup2
WORD.

01:28:37.012 --> 01:28:39.614 region:rollup2
THEIR SOLUTION IS IS BEING

01:28:37.846 --> 01:28:40.782 region:rollup2
UNDERTAKEN.

01:28:39.614 --> 01:28:42.517 region:rollup2
YEAH I THINK WE'VE WE'VE LOOKED

01:28:40.782 --> 01:28:43.118 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT. AND I DON'T KNOW

01:28:42.517 --> 01:28:44.019 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE DONE AN EXHAUSTIVE

01:28:43.118 --> 01:28:45.287 region:rollup2
SEARCH OF EVERYTHING THAT'S

01:28:44.019 --> 01:28:46.755 region:rollup2
GOING ON ACROSS THE COUNTRY I

01:28:45.287 --> 01:28:47.823 region:rollup2
THINK THE HARD PART IS WHAT.

01:28:46.755 --> 01:28:49.457 region:rollup2
COMPARE THE LOT OF THE PROGRAMS

01:28:47.823 --> 01:28:50.258 region:rollup2
THAT THAT PEOPLE BEEN REFERRING

01:28:49.457 --> 01:28:52.027 region:rollup2
TO FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S AN

01:28:50.258 --> 01:28:53.995 region:rollup2
ARIZONA STATE PROGRAM. THERE'S

01:28:52.027 --> 01:28:55.797 region:rollup2
WESTERN GOVERNORS UNIVERSITY

01:28:53.995 --> 01:28:57.098 region:rollup2
BOTH PROGRAMS ARE ACTUALLY THOSE

01:28:55.797 --> 01:28:58.633 region:rollup2
ARE BATTERERS PROGRAMS

01:28:57.098 --> 01:28:59.868 region:rollup2
SO YEAH IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY

01:28:58.633 --> 01:29:01.536 region:rollup2
OKAY THAT'S THE.

01:28:59.868 --> 01:29:03.071 region:rollup2
SORT LET'S LOOK AT THAT AND

01:29:01.536 --> 01:29:04.506 region:rollup2
LET'S LET'S USE THAT OF THE

01:29:03.071 --> 01:29:05.307 region:rollup2
MODEL BECAUSE THAT IS.

01:29:04.506 --> 01:29:08.176 region:rollup2
IT IF THAT IT'S A TOTALLY

01:29:05.307 --> 01:29:09.277 region:rollup2

HEARING.

01:32:23.705 --> 01:32:26.341 region:rollup2
THERE WERE TWO COLLEGE

PRESIDENTS THERE WHO MADE A VERY

01:32:26.341 --> 01:32:30.612 region:rollup2
COMPELLING CASE IS WHY THIS

01:32:28.076 --> 01:32:31.746 region:rollup2

GROWING THEIR CAPACITY.

01:32:31.746 --> 01:32:35.717 region:rollup2

BLASTING OUT JUST MAKE A COMMENT

01:34:37.839 --> 01:34:39.407 region:rollup2
IS.

01:34:38.006 --> 01:34:41.309 region:rollup2
.

01:34:39.407 --> 01:34:43.378 region:rollup2
CHANGE IS ALWAYS TOUGH.

01:34:41.309 --> 01:34:45.547 region:rollup2
AND NOW.

01:34:43.378 --> 01:34:47.949 region:rollup2
IF YOU LOOK AT THE AT THE WHOLE

01:34:45.547 --> 01:34:49.317 region:rollup2
ISSUE OF EQUITY.

01:34:47.949 --> 01:34:50.585 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:34:49.317 --> 01:34:50.752 region:rollup2
OF COLOR.

01:34:50.585 --> 01:34:52.654 region:rollup2
THE.

01:34:50.752 --> 01:34:54.589 region:rollup2
.

01:34:52.654 --> 01:34:55.957 region:rollup2
THE ONLY WAY WE CAN TRULY DEAL

01:34:54.589 --> 01:34:57.792 region:rollup2
WITH EQUITY.

01:34:55.957 --> 01:34:59.060 region:rollup2
IS TO EDUCATION.

01:34:57.792 --> 01:35:00.428 region:rollup2
YESTERDAY ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR

01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:01.863 region:rollup2
I MADE A COMMENT THAT.

01:35:00.428 --> 01:35:03.431 region:rollup2
MY FATHER WHO HAD A THIRD GRADE

01:35:01.863 --> 01:35:05.066 region:rollup2
EDUCATION WHOSE WORK IN THE

01:35:03.431 --> 01:35:06.968 region:rollup2
FIELD IN WORLD WAR TWO STARTED.

01:35:05.066 --> 01:35:08.436 region:rollup2
WHEN OFTEN THE COURT CAME BACK

01:35:06.968 --> 01:35:10.572 region:rollup2
WAS WORKING AT U. S. STILL.

01:35:08.436 --> 01:35:11.873 region:rollup2
AND BECAUSE OF. EL CAMINO JUNIOR

01:35:10.572 --> 01:35:13.875 region:rollup2
COLLEGE.

01:35:11.873 --> 01:35:16.010 region:rollup2
AT NIGHT.

01:35:13.875 --> 01:35:17.612 region:rollup2
HE WAS ABLE TO GET SOME SKILLS

01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:19.414 region:rollup2
NINETY DEGREE.

01:35:17.612 --> 01:35:21.516 region:rollup2
SKILLS TO WORK IN THE AEROSPACE

01:35:19.414 --> 01:35:23.017 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY AND ALLOW US TO MOVE

01:35:21.516 --> 01:35:24.385 region:rollup2
FROM THE BODY ó.

01:35:23.017 --> 01:35:25.820 region:rollup2
TO TORRANCE CALIFORNIA WE HAD

01:35:24.385 --> 01:35:26.588 region:rollup2
SIDEWALKS

01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:28.456 region:rollup2
SO THE.

01:35:26.588 --> 01:35:30.024 region:rollup2
.

01:35:28.456 --> 01:35:32.060 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT THE NEW OF HOW WE'RE

01:35:30.024 --> 01:35:33.561 region:rollup2
TRYING TO MEET DID THE EQUITY

01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:34.729 region:rollup2
ISSUE OF JOBS.

01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:36.564 region:rollup2
FOR PEOPLE SO.

01:35:34.729 --> 01:35:37.298 region:rollup2
.

01:35:36.564 --> 01:35:38.800 region:rollup2
AS I STATED MY BEGINNING

01:35:37.298 --> 01:35:40.368 region:rollup2
COMMENTS.

01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:41.803 region:rollup2
IT'S GREAT TO HAVE THE FREEDOM

01:35:40.368 --> 01:35:43.438 region:rollup2
TO GO TO COLLEGE BUT WHEN YOU'RE

01:35:41.803 --> 01:35:45.607 region:rollup2
WORKING TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE

01:35:43.438 --> 01:35:46.641 region:rollup2
YOU OFTEN CAN'T DO THIS. THIS IS

01:35:45.607 --> 01:35:48.243 region:rollup2
NOT ANYTHING NEW.

01:35:46.641 --> 01:35:50.545 region:rollup2
.

01:35:48.243 --> 01:35:51.646 region:rollup2
DF MY FATHER HAD TO GO TO EL

01:35:50.545 --> 01:35:53.281 region:rollup2
CAMINO JUNIOR COLLEGES THEY

01:35:51.646 --> 01:35:54.782 region:rollup2
DIDN'T HAVE COMPUTERS THAT HE

01:35:53.281 --> 01:35:56.584 region:rollup2
COULD DO IT IN HIS HOUSE.

01:35:54.782 --> 01:35:58.519 region:rollup2
BUT AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE

01:35:56.584 --> 01:36:00.088 region:rollup2
MILITARY WE DO THIS ALL THE TIME

01:35:58.519 --> 01:36:01.422 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU'RE ON SHIPS WHEN YOU'RE

01:36:00.088 --> 01:36:03.191 region:rollup2
DEPLOYED OVERSEAS.

01:36:01.422 --> 01:36:04.892 region:rollup2

SO IT'S A NUMBER OUT SYSTEM

01:36:11.899 --> 01:36:15.503 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS.

01:36:14.168 --> 01:36:17.071 region:rollup2
A VERY GOOD STEP IN THE

01:36:15.503 --> 01:36:18.740 region:rollup2
DIRECTION JUST CONTINUE TO WORK

FOR BEING HERE I DO HAVE AT

01:36:37.125 --> 01:36:39.327 region:rollup2
LEAST FIVE QUESTIONS I WANT TO

01:36:38.326 --> 01:36:41.229 region:rollup2
WARN THE CHAIR THAT I HAVE

01:36:39.327 --> 01:36:43.297 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF GUN TO ASK AND I

HAVE BEEN SHARED AROUND SUCCESS.

01:36:44.399 --> 01:36:47.435 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT TO AYE WE HEARD

FOR MY COLLEAGUES AND I MONICA

01:36:47.435 --> 01:36:50.305 region:rollup2
AS WELL THAT.

01:36:48.136 --> 01:36:52.206 region:rollup2
HOW WE DEFINE SUCCESS IS

01:36:50.305 --> 01:36:53.841 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT AND I KNOW YOU'VE

01:36:52.206 --> 01:36:56.244 region:rollup2
SHARED ON SOME METRICS?

01:36:53.841 --> 01:36:58.246 region:rollup2
OF HOW THAT IS DEFINED ONE OF

01:36:56.244 --> 01:37:00.114 region:rollup2
THEM BEING WAGE INCREASES ON AT

01:36:58.246 --> 01:37:01.749 region:rollup2
BASS THAT'S CORONATION ALL BREAK

01:37:00.114 --> 01:37:03.351 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT EXACTLY YOU CAN'T

01:37:01.749 --> 01:37:05.887 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY SAY THAT THAT'S THE

01:37:03.351 --> 01:37:06.087 region:rollup2
CLASS BUT YOU CAN CORRELATE IT

01:37:05.887 --> 01:37:06.954 region:rollup2
TO IT.

01:37:06.087 --> 01:37:08.489 region:rollup2
.

01:37:06.954 --> 01:37:10.558 region:rollup2
BUT HOW WILL YOU YOU KNOW WHAT

01:37:08.489 --> 01:37:12.460 region:rollup2
THE DEFINITION OF SUCCESS FOR AN

01:37:10.558 --> 01:37:15.063 region:rollup2
ONLINE PROGRAM IS IMPORTANT AS

01:37:12.460 --> 01:37:16.731 region:rollup2
IT IS. HOW WE MEASURE SUCCESS

01:37:15.063 --> 01:37:18.900 region:rollup2
AND HOW WE VIOLATE THAT CAN YOU

01:37:16.731 --> 01:37:20.668 region:rollup2
PLEASE SPEAK TO HOW WE EVALUATE

01:37:18.900 --> 01:37:21.569 region:rollup2
CIGARETTES NOT JUST WITH THE

01:37:20.668 --> 01:37:25.006 region:rollup2
METRICS OF SUCCESS ARE?

01:37:21.569 --> 01:37:27.008 region:rollup2
SURE SO MUCH THE WAY WE MEASURE.

01:37:25.006 --> 01:37:28.643 region:rollup2
SUCCESS TODAY IN THE HUNDRED

01:37:27.008 --> 01:37:31.846 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN COLLEGES TO.

01:37:28.643 --> 01:37:33.414 region:rollup2
AVAILABILITY OF DATA ON A HOUSE

01:37:31.846 --> 01:37:34.882 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ARE PROGRESSING

01:37:33.414 --> 01:37:35.450 region:rollup2
SO CALIFORNIA TO ME COLLEGES

01:37:34.882 --> 01:37:37.085 region:rollup2
HAVE SEVERAL METRICS THAT WE

01:37:35.450 --> 01:37:38.553 region:rollup2
USE.

01:37:37.085 --> 01:37:39.721 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY CONTAINED IN OUR

01:37:38.553 --> 01:37:42.223 region:rollup2
SCORECARD.

01:37:39.721 --> 01:37:44.359 region:rollup2
SO WHILE THE.

01:37:42.223 --> 01:37:44.959 region:rollup2
THIS PERSONALIZED VERY PLATFORM

01:37:44.359 --> 01:37:45.960 region:rollup2
IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT BECAUSE

01:37:44.959 --> 01:37:47.962 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT.

01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:49.931 region:rollup2
MARCHING TOWARD A ESOS HIS

01:37:47.962 --> 01:37:51.899 region:rollup2
DEGREE OR A TYPICAL

01:37:49.931 --> 01:37:53.568 region:rollup2
UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION.

01:37:51.899 --> 01:37:55.036 region:rollup2
STUDENTS STILL HAVE TO

01:37:53.568 --> 01:37:56.437 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY ARE

01:37:55.036 --> 01:37:58.239 region:rollup2
MASTERING THE CONTENT.

01:37:56.437 --> 01:37:59.941 region:rollup2
AND SO.

01:37:58.239 --> 01:38:02.110 region:rollup2
JUST AS WE DO NOW.

01:37:59.941 --> 01:38:04.212 region:rollup2
IN A TYPICAL ENVIRONMENT THAT'S

01:38:02.110 --> 01:38:05.413 region:rollup2
DONE THROUGH A GRADING SYSTEM

01:38:04.212 --> 01:38:06.280 region:rollup2
THAT'S DONE THROUGH PROGRESSION

01:38:05.413 --> 01:38:08.082 region:rollup2
FROM ONE CLASS TO ANOTHER

01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:09.183 region:rollup2
PERSISTENCE.

01:38:08.082 --> 01:38:10.985 region:rollup2
AND THEN COMPLETION OF AN

01:38:09.183 --> 01:38:12.687 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL GOAL.

01:38:10.985 --> 01:38:14.722 region:rollup2
THOSE METRICS WOULD APPLY. TO

01:38:12.687 --> 01:38:16.257 region:rollup2
THIS UP PLATFORM AS WELL.

01:38:14.722 --> 01:38:17.358 region:rollup2
.

01:38:16.257 --> 01:38:19.394 region:rollup2
THE OTHER METRIC THAT WE'VE

01:38:17.358 --> 01:38:21.629 region:rollup2
RECENTLY CREATED WHICH IS IN THE

01:38:19.394 --> 01:38:22.964 region:rollup2
VISION FOR SUCCESS IS THIS ISSUE

01:38:21.629 --> 01:38:25.366 region:rollup2
OF PLACEMENT IN THE JOB.

01:38:22.964 --> 01:38:26.768 region:rollup2
AND GAINING A MEANINGFUL WAGE

01:38:25.366 --> 01:38:29.437 region:rollup2
WE DO FEEL THAT WE HAVE THE

01:38:26.768 --> 01:38:31.239 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO THE DATA THAT WE NEED.

01:38:29.437 --> 01:38:33.174 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO PRODUCE.

01:38:31.239 --> 01:38:34.609 region:rollup2
QUALITY INFORMATION ABOUT

01:38:33.174 --> 01:38:35.643 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT AN INDIVIDUAL.

01:38:34.609 --> 01:38:37.512 region:rollup2
.

01:38:35.643 --> 01:38:38.880 region:rollup2
A BENEFITTED.

01:38:37.512 --> 01:38:40.381 region:rollup2
THROUGH WAGE GAME.

01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:41.749 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY IT'S

01:38:40.381 --> 01:38:42.383 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FOR US TO BUILD THESE

01:38:41.749 --> 01:38:43.084 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE EMPLOYERS

01:38:42.383 --> 01:38:44.952 region:rollup2
AND.

01:38:43.084 --> 01:38:45.119 region:rollup2
AND THE LABOR COMMUNITY.

01:38:44.952 --> 01:38:46.888 region:rollup2
SO.

01:38:45.119 --> 01:38:48.556 region:rollup2
.

01:38:46.888 --> 01:38:50.158 region:rollup2
TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IT

01:38:48.556 --> 01:38:51.793 region:rollup2
WOULD BE VERY MUCH

01:38:50.158 --> 01:38:52.960 region:rollup2
SIMILAR APPLICABLE MEASURES THAT

01:38:51.793 --> 01:38:55.263 region:rollup2
WE USE FOR ANY OF ON AND

01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:56.664 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN COLLEGES. AS WELL AS

01:38:55.263 --> 01:38:58.199 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL ELEMENT. ARE

01:38:56.664 --> 01:39:00.902 region:rollup2
ENCOMPASSES BASE SYSTEM BY THE

01:38:58.199 --> 01:39:01.569 region:rollup2
WAY. YOU ONLY PROGRESS IF YOU

01:39:00.902 --> 01:39:03.504 region:rollup2
MASTER THE CONTENT.

01:39:01.569 --> 01:39:05.606 region:rollup2
.

01:39:03.504 --> 01:39:07.208 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS SELF PACED.

01:39:05.606 --> 01:39:09.444 region:rollup2
IF A STUDENT MASTERS THE

01:39:07.208 --> 01:39:09.944 region:rollup2
CONTENT THEN THEY MOVE FORWARD

01:39:09.444 --> 01:39:11.045 region:rollup2
IF THEY DON'T THEN THEY

01:39:09.944 --> 01:39:13.047 region:rollup2
CONTINUE.

01:39:11.045 --> 01:39:15.316 region:rollup2
TO.

01:39:13.047 --> 01:39:16.484 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO CONTENT WITH SOME

01:39:15.316 --> 01:39:18.386 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL SUPPORT UNTIL THEY

01:39:16.484 --> 01:39:20.121 region:rollup2
MASTER AT SO. PART OF IT IS

01:39:18.386 --> 01:39:22.089 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATING THAT COMPETENCY

01:39:20.121 --> 01:39:23.658 region:rollup2
WHICH IS IN A COMPLICATED SYSTEM

01:39:22.089 --> 01:39:24.992 region:rollup2
IT IS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD

01:39:23.658 --> 01:39:26.327 region:rollup2
EITHER THEY MASTER THE CONTENT

01:39:24.992 --> 01:39:28.095 region:rollup2
OR THEY DON'T AND IF THEY DO

01:39:26.327 --> 01:39:29.864 region:rollup2
THEY MOVE FORWARD.

01:39:28.095 --> 01:39:31.566 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT'S HOW YOU. WHAT I'M

01:39:29.864 --> 01:39:33.067 region:rollup2
HEARING IS HOW YOU AND MEASURE

01:39:31.566 --> 01:39:34.435 region:rollup2
OR DO THERE ARE TALK ABOUT

01:39:33.067 --> 01:39:36.504 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL STUDENT SUCCESS WHO

01:39:34.435 --> 01:39:39.307 region:rollup2
HOW WILL THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE

01:39:36.504 --> 01:39:41.742 region:rollup2
KNOW IF YOU'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL?

01:39:39.307 --> 01:39:43.211 region:rollup2
WITH THE ENTIRE PROGRAM AND THE

01:39:41.742 --> 01:39:44.412 region:rollup2
ENTIRE INITIATIVE.

01:39:43.211 --> 01:39:44.612 region:rollup2
WELL FIRST OF ALL LET ME SAY

01:39:44.412 --> 01:39:46.047 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:39:44.612 --> 01:39:47.148 region:rollup2
.

01:39:46.047 --> 01:39:49.183 region:rollup2
WE WELCOME.

01:39:47.148 --> 01:39:50.384 region:rollup2
ANY ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS OR

01:39:49.183 --> 01:39:52.253 region:rollup2
IDEAS THAT THIS BODY WOULD HAVE

01:39:50.384 --> 01:39:54.422 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE

01:39:52.253 --> 01:39:56.157 region:rollup2
CONCERNS THAT YOU ALL HAVE A IN

COLLEGES EXIST SO THAT WE DON'T.

01:40:51.312 --> 01:40:54.315 region:rollup2
UNDERMINE ENROLLMENT OVER OTHER

01:40:52.647 --> 01:40:55.416 region:rollup2
COLLEGES SO THEY WOULD HAVE TO

01:40:54.315 --> 01:40:56.884 region:rollup2
BE CLEAR CRITERIA.

01:40:55.416 --> 01:40:58.152 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF HOW WE HOLD THE

PARTNER COLLEGES TO BUILD

01:41:01.522 --> 01:41:06.761 region:rollup2
CAPACITY NOT TO CANNIBALIZE.

01:41:04.525 --> 01:41:08.629 region:rollup2
I YOU DO YOU DESCRIBED THAT THIS

01:41:06.761 --> 01:41:09.764 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION IN PAR IS ABOUT THE

01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:11.499 region:rollup2
FUTURE OF

01:41:09.764 --> 01:41:14.468 region:rollup2
I HAD THE WORK FORCE.

01:41:11.499 --> 01:41:16.270 region:rollup2
AND OF THE LABOR AND AND IN MY

01:41:14.468 --> 01:41:18.940 region:rollup2
MIND I'D THERE IS A STRONG

01:41:16.270 --> 01:41:19.473 region:rollup2
INTERSECTION BETWEEN WHAT THIS

01:41:18.940 --> 01:41:22.243 region:rollup2
MEANS FOR THE FUTURE OF

01:41:19.473 --> 01:41:22.977 region:rollup2
EDUCATION. AND BECAUSE I ALSO

01:41:22.243 --> 01:41:25.579 region:rollup2
THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

01:41:22.977 --> 01:41:26.747 region:rollup2
FUTURE OF EDUCATION I LOOK AND

01:41:25.579 --> 01:41:27.982 region:rollup2
AT MY OWN EXPERIENCE IN THE

01:41:26.747 --> 01:41:29.517 region:rollup2
RESEARCH IN THE LITERATURE OUT

01:41:27.982 --> 01:41:30.918 region:rollup2
THERE THAT REMINDS US THAT NO

01:41:29.517 --> 01:41:33.287 region:rollup2
MATTER WHAT INITIATIVES AND

01:41:30.918 --> 01:41:35.556 region:rollup2
PROJECTS WE'VE. TRIED AND WE

01:41:33.287 --> 01:41:36.791 region:rollup2
STILL CONTINUE TO SEE FRESH

01:41:35.556 --> 01:41:38.626 region:rollup2
NARRATION LOW INCOME STUDENTS

01:41:36.791 --> 01:41:41.495 region:rollup2
I'M WHO STRUGGLE NO MATTER WHAT

01:41:38.626 --> 01:41:42.597 region:rollup2
THE MODEL IS. AND AND SO FROM

01:41:41.495 --> 01:41:44.565 region:rollup2
THAT PLACE.

01:41:42.597 --> 01:41:46.367 region:rollup2
I ASKED MYSELF

01:41:44.565 --> 01:41:48.169 region:rollup2
WHY NOT A PILOT.

01:41:46.367 --> 01:41:50.104 region:rollup2
WHY DOES THIS HAVE TO BE THE

01:41:48.169 --> 01:41:53.040 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IT IS AND WHY NOT PILOT

01:41:50.104 --> 01:41:54.408 region:rollup2
IT? I'M IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT

01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:55.943 region:rollup2
WE MAY WANT TO MAKE THE

01:41:54.408 --> 01:41:57.311 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE OR NEEDED

01:41:55.943 --> 01:41:59.180 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS IN THE FUTURE BUT TO

01:41:57.311 --> 01:41:59.747 region:rollup2
GIVE US THE TIME TO UNDERSTAND

01:41:59.180 --> 01:42:01.315 region:rollup2
LIKE IS THIS REALLY GOING TO

01:41:59.747 --> 01:42:02.450 region:rollup2
WORK.

01:42:01.315 --> 01:42:03.317 region:rollup2
SO I I THINK THAT'S A FAIR

01:42:02.450 --> 01:42:05.486 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

01:42:03.317 --> 01:42:07.922 region:rollup2
AND IN MANY WAYS THE WAY THIS

01:42:05.486 --> 01:42:09.090 region:rollup2
IS BEING DESIGNED CURRENTLY IS

01:42:07.922 --> 01:42:10.124 region:rollup2
IN MANY WAYS A PILOT WE'VE BEEN

01:42:09.090 --> 01:42:11.859 region:rollup2
ASKED.

01:42:10.124 --> 01:42:12.793 region:rollup2
TO DEVELOP AT LEAST THREE

01:42:11.859 --> 01:42:14.895 region:rollup2
PATHWAYS.

01:42:12.793 --> 01:42:16.297 region:rollup2
TO ENROLL THE FIRST COHORT

01:42:14.895 --> 01:42:17.531 region:rollup2
STUDENT.

01:42:16.297 --> 01:42:18.899 region:rollup2
STUDENTS BY THE END OF TWENTY

01:42:17.531 --> 01:42:20.668 region:rollup2
NINETEEN.

01:42:18.899 --> 01:42:22.670 region:rollup2
SO I'M I WOULD BE VERY

01:42:20.668 --> 01:42:23.537 region:rollup2
COMFORTABLE COMING BACK TO THIS

01:42:22.670 --> 01:42:25.072 region:rollup2
BODY.

01:42:23.537 --> 01:42:27.675 region:rollup2
AT A FUTURE TIME.

01:42:25.072 --> 01:42:29.543 region:rollup2
ENSURING THAT WE HAVE MET THOSE

01:42:27.675 --> 01:42:31.812 region:rollup2
GOALS IN ORDER TO RECEIVE

01:42:29.543 --> 01:42:33.214 region:rollup2
CONTINUED INVESTMENT IF THAT'S

01:42:31.812 --> 01:42:34.315 region:rollup2
THE PLEASURE OF THIS BODY.

01:42:33.214 --> 01:42:37.651 region:rollup2

01:42:34.315 --> 01:42:38.986 region:rollup2
.

01:42:37.651 --> 01:42:41.022 region:rollup2
WHETHER WE DO IT.

THERE NEEDS TO BE CONTINUED

01:42:46.727 --> 01:42:49.430 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT I THINK.

01:42:47.928 --> 01:42:50.031 region:rollup2
WE ARE VERY OPEN TO BE HELD

01:42:49.430 --> 01:42:51.699 region:rollup2

ALSO FOR INSTITUTIONAL SUCCESS

01:43:08.015 --> 01:43:11.252 region:rollup2
IS TO IS TO LOOK AT WHETHER THE

01:43:09.850 --> 01:43:14.088 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WERE SUCCESSFUL OR NOT.

01:43:11.252 --> 01:43:16.323 region:rollup2
AND WE ARE ABLE TO IDENTIFY A

01:43:14.088 --> 01:43:18.993 region:rollup2
MULTITUDE OF SERVICES INCLUDING

PARTICULARLY.

01:43:48.255 --> 01:43:51.025 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS IN THIS.

01:43:49.890 --> 01:43:52.893 region:rollup2
LEARNING ENVIRONMENT

01:43:51.025 --> 01:43:55.029 region:rollup2
ADULT LEARNERS

WILL NEED SUPPORT THEY WILL NEED

01:43:55.029 --> 01:43:57.765 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS WHY AGAIN IT'S

01:43:56.464 --> 01:43:58.966 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THAT AS WE DEVELOP

01:43:57.765 --> 01:44:00.434 region:rollup2
THESE PATHWAYS AND IF YOU LOOK

01:43:58.966 --> 01:44:02.069 region:rollup2
AT THE PRINCIPLES THAT WE'VE PUT

01:44:00.434 --> 01:44:03.370 region:rollup2
FORWARD TO DEVELOP THE PATHWAYS.

01:44:02.069 --> 01:44:04.672 region:rollup2
THEY REQUIRE US

01:44:03.370 --> 01:44:07.108 region:rollup2
TO WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS WITH

01:44:04.672 --> 01:44:08.943 region:rollup2
THEIR LABOR EMPLOYERS TO CREATE

01:44:07.108 --> 01:44:09.944 region:rollup2
THE MENTORSHIP THE COACHING.

01:44:08.943 --> 01:44:13.013 region:rollup2
THE INTRUSIVE.

01:44:09.944 --> 01:44:15.483 region:rollup2
.

01:44:13.013 --> 01:44:16.717 region:rollup2
SUPPORT SYSTEM THAT WE WILL

01:44:15.483 --> 01:44:18.319 region:rollup2
NEED TO ENSURE THAT THESE

01:44:16.717 --> 01:44:19.487 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS SUCCEED WE'VE SEEN

01:44:18.319 --> 01:44:20.888 region:rollup2
MODELS OF THAT.

01:44:19.487 --> 01:44:22.323 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.

01:44:20.888 --> 01:44:23.524 region:rollup2
IN PUBLIC.

01:44:22.323 --> 01:44:25.192 region:rollup2
ONLINE PLATFORMS.

01:44:23.524 --> 01:44:26.694 region:rollup2
.

01:44:25.192 --> 01:44:28.028 region:rollup2
WE'RE LEARNING A LOT ABOUT WHAT

01:44:26.694 --> 01:44:29.663 region:rollup2
WE'RE DOING NOW WITH THE CURRENT

01:44:28.028 --> 01:44:31.866 region:rollup2
ONLINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE AND

01:44:29.663 --> 01:44:33.300 region:rollup2
HOW WE'RE EMBEDDING SUPPORT

SERVICES IN THAT ENVIRONMENT.

01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:36.871 region:rollup2
SO WE FEEL CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN

01:44:34.902 --> 01:44:38.572 region:rollup2
DO THAT IN PARTICULAR ADD ONE

01:44:36.871 --> 01:44:39.039 region:rollup2
MORE COMPONENT WHICH IS THAT

01:44:38.572 --> 01:44:40.007 region:rollup2
COACHING AND MENTORING

01:44:39.039 --> 01:44:41.442 region:rollup2
COMPONENT.

01:44:40.007 --> 01:44:42.476 region:rollup2
THAT WILL BE PROVIDED BY EITHER

01:44:41.442 --> 01:44:43.611 region:rollup2
THE LABOR PARTNER OR THE

01:44:42.476 --> 01:44:44.645 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER PARTNER

01:44:43.611 --> 01:44:46.080 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THESE

01:44:44.645 --> 01:44:48.048 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS.

01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:49.817 region:rollup2
FACE MANY MANY CHALLENGES.

01:44:48.048 --> 01:44:50.551 region:rollup2
INCLUDING EQUIPMENT ACCESS TO

01:44:49.817 --> 01:44:52.953 region:rollup2
BROADBAND.

01:44:50.551 --> 01:44:55.055 region:rollup2
INTERNET SO IN AREAS WHERE

01:44:52.953 --> 01:44:56.157 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT AVAILABLE WE WOULD BE

01:44:55.055 --> 01:44:57.391 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH THE EMPLOYER FOR

01:44:56.157 --> 01:44:58.692 region:rollup2
THE LABOR PARTY TO ENSURE THAT

01:44:57.391 --> 01:44:59.660 region:rollup2
THERE IS A SPACE.

01:44:58.692 --> 01:45:00.995 region:rollup2
WHERE THESE INDIVIDUALS CAN GO

01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:02.530 region:rollup2
TO GAIN ACCESS

01:45:00.995 --> 01:45:04.598 region:rollup2
TO BROADBAND EACH AND JUST TO BE

01:45:02.530 --> 01:45:05.933 region:rollup2
CLEAR DOES THAT THEN MEAN THAT

01:45:04.598 --> 01:45:07.468 region:rollup2
THERE IS A ROLE FOR THE LOCAL

01:45:05.933 --> 01:45:09.670 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO PLAY IN

01:45:07.468 --> 01:45:11.071 region:rollup2
THIS BECAUSE? I MEAN THEY CAN'T

01:45:09.670 --> 01:45:12.840 region:rollup2
ALL TRAVEL TO.

01:45:11.071 --> 01:45:13.641 region:rollup2
YES RIGHT YEAH.

01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:16.977 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY.

01:45:13.641 --> 01:45:16.977 region:rollup2
HER PUTTING FOURTEEN COLLEGES

01:45:17.044 --> 01:45:20.948 region:rollup2
SO WHETHER OR NOT. THEY PROVIDE

01:45:19.146 --> 01:45:23.317 region:rollup2
SPACE PROVIDE.

01:45:20.948 --> 01:45:24.552 region:rollup2
PART TIME INSTRUCTORS FULL TIME

01:45:23.317 --> 01:45:26.220 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTORS

01:45:24.552 --> 01:45:27.755 region:rollup2

01:45:26.220 --> 01:45:29.490 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE DELIVERING.

01:45:27.755 --> 01:45:30.057 region:rollup2
I WE WOULD ABSOLUTELY EXPECT A

PARTNER WITH THEM.

01:45:30.057 --> 01:45:34.028 region:rollup2
BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST YOU KNOW

01:45:32.860 --> 01:45:35.663 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE UP FRONT.

01:45:34.028 --> 01:45:37.832 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE THE SUPPORT WE NEED

01:45:35.663 --> 01:45:39.867 region:rollup2
FROM OUR LABOR PARTNERS EMPLOYER

01:45:37.832 --> 01:45:41.068 region:rollup2
PARTNERS TO ENSURE IT IS THESE

01:45:39.867 --> 01:45:41.969 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS AND ROLL.

01:45:41.068 --> 01:45:43.737 region:rollup2
THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE THE

01:45:41.969 --> 01:45:45.306 region:rollup2
SUPPORT NECESSARY AND AND THAT'S

01:45:43.737 --> 01:45:47.007 region:rollup2
WHAT. YOU KNOW QUITE FRANKLY MY

01:45:45.306 --> 01:45:48.008 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS ARE CONVERSATIONS

01:45:47.007 --> 01:45:49.910 region:rollup2
WITH OUR LABOR PARTNERS THEY

01:45:48.008 --> 01:45:51.312 region:rollup2
EXPECT THAT OF US.

01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:53.881 region:rollup2
AND IF REQUIRED THAT OF US IF

01:45:51.312 --> 01:45:56.150 region:rollup2
THEY DO PARTNER WITH.

01:45:53.881 --> 01:45:58.018 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THING IS IT IS JUST

01:45:56.150 --> 01:46:00.387 region:rollup2
FOR CLARITY PURPOSES AND. IT

01:45:58.018 --> 01:46:02.289 region:rollup2
THERE IS. FEES ASSOCIATED WITH

01:46:00.387 --> 01:46:03.557 region:rollup2
THIS DO WE EXPECT THAT THESE

01:46:02.289 --> 01:46:04.992 region:rollup2
FEES ARE GOING TO BE ALIGNED OR

01:46:03.557 --> 01:46:07.194 region:rollup2
IS THIS NEW BOARD AND NEW

01:46:04.992 --> 01:46:09.697 region:rollup2
COLLEGE GOING TO ADAPT A

01:46:07.194 --> 01:46:11.031 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT MODEL. AND THAT'S

01:46:09.697 --> 01:46:12.867 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THAN THE FEE STRUCTURE

01:46:11.031 --> 01:46:13.434 region:rollup2
THAT WE SEE IN PLACE FOR THE

01:46:12.867 --> 01:46:15.736 region:rollup2
HUNDRED IMPORTANT COMMUNITY

01:46:13.434 --> 01:46:17.071 region:rollup2
COLLEGES. SO FIRST OF ALL.

01:46:15.736 --> 01:46:18.272 region:rollup2
THE FEE STRUCTURE WOULD BE

01:46:17.071 --> 01:46:19.406 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT.

01:46:18.272 --> 01:46:21.275 region:rollup2
WITH.

01:46:19.406 --> 01:46:22.343 region:rollup2
THE COST OF EDUCATION IN THE

01:46:21.275 --> 01:46:23.978 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA TOO BECAUSE I THINK

01:46:22.343 --> 01:46:25.312 region:rollup2
FINANCE.

01:46:23.978 --> 01:46:27.548 region:rollup2
LAID THAT OUT.

01:46:25.312 --> 01:46:29.617 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S A COMPETENCY BASED

01:46:27.548 --> 01:46:32.319 region:rollup2
MODEL WE WILL PROBABLY NEED LOOK

01:46:29.617 --> 01:46:33.821 region:rollup2
AT ADAPTING.

01:46:32.319 --> 01:46:35.189 region:rollup2
A FEE STRUCTURE THAT'S

01:46:33.821 --> 01:46:36.557 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT WITH THE WAY THE

01:46:35.189 --> 01:46:39.360 region:rollup2
STUDENTS COME IN AND OUT.

01:46:36.557 --> 01:46:40.761 region:rollup2
IN THIS MODEL STUDENTS CAN COME

01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:42.329 region:rollup2
IN AND OUT WHENEVER THEY WANT

01:46:40.761 --> 01:46:43.864 region:rollup2
BASICALLY THERE IS NO

01:46:42.329 --> 01:46:47.568 region:rollup2
TRADITIONAL ACADEMIC CALENDAR.

01:46:43.864 --> 01:46:49.303 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT A PER UNIT BASIS RIGHT

01:46:47.568 --> 01:46:50.738 region:rollup2
NOW WE CHARGE PER UNIT.

01:46:49.303 --> 01:46:52.172 region:rollup2
SO WE WOULD NEED TO ADOPT AND

01:46:50.738 --> 01:46:53.908 region:rollup2
ADAPT FEE STRUCTURE THAT'S

01:46:52.172 --> 01:46:55.609 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT WITH THE FORTY SIX

01:46:53.908 --> 01:46:57.011 region:rollup2
DOLLARS A UNIT FOR THIS MODEL SO

01:46:55.609 --> 01:46:58.846 region:rollup2
WE WOULD BE WORKING. WITH THE

01:46:57.011 --> 01:46:59.880 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS WELL

01:46:58.846 --> 01:47:00.981 region:rollup2
IT'S YOU KNOW CURRENTLY THE

01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:03.017 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE SETS.

01:47:00.981 --> 01:47:04.485 region:rollup2
OTHER FEATS FOR MUSICOLOGISTS SO

01:47:03.017 --> 01:47:06.553 region:rollup2
WE WOULD NEED TO FIND SOMETHING

01:47:04.485 --> 01:47:07.721 region:rollup2
THAT CONFORMS AND COMPORTS TO

01:47:06.553 --> 01:47:09.089 region:rollup2
THE FEE STRUCTURE THAT YOU'VE

01:47:07.721 --> 01:47:10.724 region:rollup2
ALREADY ADOPTED.

01:47:09.089 --> 01:47:12.159 region:rollup2
AND AS YOU THINK OF BOTH THE

01:47:10.724 --> 01:47:15.062 region:rollup2
SHORT TERM AND THE LONG TERM.

01:47:12.159 --> 01:47:16.864 region:rollup2
OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN IN

01:47:15.062 --> 01:47:19.166 region:rollup2
THE LONG TERM HOW DO YOU DECIDE

01:47:16.864 --> 01:47:21.235 region:rollup2
IF YOU EXPAND HOW DO YOU DECIDE

01:47:19.166 --> 01:47:22.836 region:rollup2
IF THIS GROWS BIGGER AND WE'RE

01:47:21.235 --> 01:47:24.371 region:rollup2
HAVING A CONVERSATION NOW. YOU

01:47:22.836 --> 01:47:26.373 region:rollup2
KNOW INITIALLY AND IT SOUNDS

01:47:24.371 --> 01:47:27.574 region:rollup2
LIKE IT'S LIMITED PATHWAYS.

01:47:26.373 --> 01:47:29.543 region:rollup2
VERY FOCUS BUT

01:47:27.574 --> 01:47:32.446 region:rollup2
HOW DOES THAT DECISION IN THE

01:47:29.543 --> 01:47:33.247 region:rollup2
LONG TERM AND FUTURE WORK.

01:47:32.446 --> 01:47:34.882 region:rollup2
WELL I THINK.

01:47:33.247 --> 01:47:36.483 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL.

01:47:34.882 --> 01:47:37.918 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TO THE CONVERSATION TO

01:47:36.483 --> 01:47:39.219 region:rollup2
HAPPEN NOW AT OUR COLLEGES.

01:47:37.918 --> 01:47:40.788 region:rollup2
.

01:47:39.219 --> 01:47:42.389 region:rollup2
THERE.

01:47:40.788 --> 01:47:43.757 region:rollup2
THE CURRICULUM DISCUSSIONS ARE

01:47:42.389 --> 01:47:46.727 region:rollup2
LED BY THE FACULTY OF THAT

01:47:43.757 --> 01:47:49.129 region:rollup2
COLLEGE SO IF THERE IS A.

01:47:46.727 --> 01:47:50.531 region:rollup2
A DEMAND IN THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:47:49.129 --> 01:47:51.932 region:rollup2
SERVED WE WOULD EXPECT THAT THE

01:47:50.531 --> 01:47:52.866 region:rollup2
CURRICULUM PROCESS WHICH TRIED

01:47:51.932 --> 01:47:54.968 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS THAT DEMAND.

01:47:52.866 --> 01:47:56.036 region:rollup2
.

01:47:54.968 --> 01:47:57.838 region:rollup2
IF THERE ARE ANY.

01:47:56.036 --> 01:47:58.739 region:rollup2
NEW ASPECTS OF THE BECAUSE IT

01:47:57.838 --> 01:47:59.707 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE TO BE BROUGHT FORWARD

01:47:58.739 --> 01:48:01.241 region:rollup2
TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS.

01:47:59.707 --> 01:48:02.476 region:rollup2
.

01:48:01.241 --> 01:48:03.977 region:rollup2
IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT

01:48:02.476 --> 01:48:06.513 region:rollup2
THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO COME TO

01:48:03.977 --> 01:48:07.181 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE TO ASK FOR THAT.

01:48:06.513 --> 01:48:10.651 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:48:07.181 --> 01:48:12.886 region:rollup2
IN THE END WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:48:10.651 --> 01:48:14.621 region:rollup2
THAT WE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE

01:48:12.886 --> 01:48:16.290 region:rollup2
CURRENT INVESTMENT FIRST THOUGH

01:48:14.621 --> 01:48:18.959 region:rollup2
IF THERE IS A DESIRE AND A

01:48:16.290 --> 01:48:20.894 region:rollup2
DEMAND TO EXPAND AND INCREASE

01:48:18.959 --> 01:48:22.429 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF ONLINE OFFERINGS.

01:48:20.894 --> 01:48:24.064 region:rollup2
IN A TRADITIONAL UNDERGRADUATE

01:48:22.429 --> 01:48:26.133 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK THAT WE WOULD BE

01:48:24.064 --> 01:48:26.700 region:rollup2
RELYING ON THE ONLINE EDUCATION

01:48:26.133 --> 01:48:27.468 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE TO REACH THAT THE

01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:29.636 region:rollup2
MAN.

01:48:27.468 --> 01:48:30.838 region:rollup2
SO I WE THINK THE TWO CAN WORK

01:48:29.636 --> 01:48:32.072 region:rollup2
IN CONCERT WITH A WE ALREADY

01:48:30.838 --> 01:48:33.841 region:rollup2
HAVE ONE MECHANISM FOR

01:48:32.072 --> 01:48:35.409 region:rollup2
UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION ONLINE

01:48:33.841 --> 01:48:36.643 region:rollup2
WE WANNA CONTINUE TO GROW THAT.

01:48:35.409 --> 01:48:38.679 region:rollup2
IN THIS GIVES IS JUST ONE MORE

01:48:36.643 --> 01:48:40.147 region:rollup2
TOOL BUT WE WOULD HAVE THE SAME

01:48:38.679 --> 01:48:42.082 region:rollup2
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS IN THE

01:48:40.147 --> 01:48:43.917 region:rollup2
SAME PROCESS FOR REQUESTING

01:48:42.082 --> 01:48:45.619 region:rollup2
EXPANSION AS WE DO NOW.

01:48:43.917 --> 01:48:46.987 region:rollup2
THANK YOU AND I MEAN JUST IN

01:48:45.619 --> 01:48:47.688 region:rollup2
CLOSING AS A COMMENT I THINK

01:48:46.987 --> 01:48:49.556 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

01:48:47.688 --> 01:48:51.458 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS I'M IF YOU KNOW

01:48:49.556 --> 01:48:52.693 region:rollup2
INTERNALLY AMONGST MEMBERS. AND

01:48:51.458 --> 01:48:54.428 region:rollup2
WE'VE WE YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD

01:48:52.693 --> 01:48:55.496 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS AS WELL AND I

01:48:54.428 --> 01:48:57.631 region:rollup2
THINK WELL I CERTAINLY

01:48:55.496 --> 01:48:58.999 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE AND YOU KNOW THE

01:48:57.631 --> 01:49:01.168 region:rollup2
ESSENCE OF THIS THIS IS ABOUT

01:48:58.999 --> 01:49:04.038 region:rollup2
GETTING NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS.

01:49:01.168 --> 01:49:06.006 region:rollup2
ENROLLED AND CALIFORNIA PUBLIC

01:49:04.038 --> 01:49:07.641 region:rollup2
COLLEGE RIGHT AYE I GET THAT I

01:49:06.006 --> 01:49:09.610 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THAT AND THEIR.

01:49:07.641 --> 01:49:10.778 region:rollup2
I ALSO THINK THAT.

01:49:09.610 --> 01:49:12.446 region:rollup2
SOME OF MY CONCERNS AND

01:49:10.778 --> 01:49:14.815 region:rollup2
HESITATION COME FROM A PLACE OF

01:49:12.446 --> 01:49:16.283 region:rollup2
ALSO WATCHING MULTIPLE MODELS IN

01:49:14.815 --> 01:49:18.118 region:rollup2
EDUCATION AND TRIED AND WE

01:49:16.283 --> 01:49:20.521 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO SEE FIRSTHAND

01:49:18.118 --> 01:49:21.588 region:rollup2
ORATION. STUDENTS WHO HAVE A

01:49:20.521 --> 01:49:23.624 region:rollup2
NEED TO WORK IN A FULL TIME

01:49:21.588 --> 01:49:27.761 region:rollup2
STRUGGLE IN ALL OF THESE MODELS

01:49:23.624 --> 01:49:29.396 region:rollup2
SO I RAISE THESE QUESTIONS AND

01:49:27.761 --> 01:49:31.999 region:rollup2
I'M YOU KNOW AND THEY'RE PARTLY

01:49:29.396 --> 01:49:32.499 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS SLASH CONCERNS OF

01:49:31.999 --> 01:49:33.500 region:rollup2
RIGHT TERMS OF WHAT I'M

01:49:32.499 --> 01:49:36.503 region:rollup2
THINKING.

01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:39.306 region:rollup2
SIMPLY AS A WAY TO ENSURE THAT

01:49:36.503 --> 01:49:41.408 region:rollup2
THIS MODEL WHILE GREAT INTENT

01:49:39.306 --> 01:49:43.343 region:rollup2
DOESN'T LEAVE BEHIND THE STUDENT

01:49:41.408 --> 01:49:45.979 region:rollup2
THAT EVERY OTHER MODEL HAS LEFT

01:49:43.343 --> 01:49:47.681 region:rollup2
BEHIND IN CALIFORNIA AMEND

01:49:45.979 --> 01:49:49.483 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY OUR COUNTRY IT'S NOT

01:49:47.681 --> 01:49:51.819 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT JUST THERE SO I WANT TO

01:49:49.483 --> 01:49:54.421 region:rollup2
BE CLEAR THAT. AND THAT'S REALLY

01:49:51.819 --> 01:49:55.823 region:rollup2
WHERE THE CONCERN IS AND NOT A

01:49:54.421 --> 01:49:59.059 region:rollup2
CONCERN OF WHETHER OR NOT WE

01:49:55.823 --> 01:50:01.228 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE FLEXIBLE OR ADAPT TO

01:49:59.059 --> 01:50:04.031 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW NEW LEARNING STYLES.

01:50:01.228 --> 01:50:04.498 region:rollup2
THAT I CAN FOLLOW BUT AND IT IS

01:50:04.031 --> 01:50:05.099 region:rollup2
A CONCERN OF.

01:50:04.498 --> 01:50:05.732 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO

01:50:05.099 --> 01:50:05.933 region:rollup2
WORK FOR THE STUDENTS THAT? YOU

01:50:05.732 --> 01:50:08.135 region:rollup2
KNOW.

01:50:05.933 --> 01:50:10.003 region:rollup2
HAVE A HISTORY OF IT IS A FAIR

01:50:08.135 --> 01:50:11.605 region:rollup2
NOT EARNING WELL SO YEAH BECAUSE

01:50:10.003 --> 01:50:13.273 region:rollup2
THE MODEL DOESN'T WORK SO THAT I

01:50:11.605 --> 01:50:14.241 region:rollup2
THINK I THINK YOU.

01:50:13.273 --> 01:50:15.142 region:rollup2
COULD AMERICAN AYE NETS YET

01:50:14.241 --> 01:50:15.809 region:rollup2
CHRIS FERGUSON WITH FINANCE

01:50:15.142 --> 01:50:16.443 region:rollup2
I THINK YOUR POINT OF WOULD YOU

01:50:15.809 --> 01:50:17.244 region:rollup2
KNOW REITERATE THE RESEARCH AND

01:50:16.443 --> 01:50:18.145 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT UNIT SPECIFICALLY

01:50:17.244 --> 01:50:20.247 region:rollup2
WILL BE LOOKING AT. ITEMS SUCH

01:50:18.145 --> 01:50:21.648 region:rollup2
AS ARE THEIR DISPARITIES IN THE

01:50:20.247 --> 01:50:23.784 region:rollup2
ACHIEVEMENT GAP IN THIS COLLEGE

01:50:21.648 --> 01:50:26.286 region:rollup2
AND WILL BE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

01:50:23.784 --> 01:50:28.021 region:rollup2
CONSTANTLY. AT NEW STRATEGIES TO

01:50:26.286 --> 01:50:29.756 region:rollup2
ENSURE IT THAT IS OCCURRING THAT

01:50:28.021 --> 01:50:31.158 region:rollup2
WE ADDRESS IT INSTANTLY AND THAT

01:50:29.756 --> 01:50:32.993 region:rollup2
THE COLLEGE TAKES THAT INTO

01:50:31.158 --> 01:50:34.962 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT FROM THE START AND IS

01:50:32.993 --> 01:50:35.496 region:rollup2
REVIEWING IT. CONSTANTLY GREAT

01:50:34.962 --> 01:50:36.897 region:rollup2
THANK YOU AND I DO WANT TO

01:50:35.496 --> 01:50:38.632 region:rollup2
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. THERE IS

01:50:36.897 --> 01:50:39.566 region:rollup2
RESEARCH NOW THAT FIRST AND LOW

01:50:38.632 --> 01:50:41.335 region:rollup2
INCOME STUDENTS ARE NOT DOING

01:50:39.566 --> 01:50:42.936 region:rollup2
WELL ON ONLINE YOU KNOW I MEAN

01:50:41.335 --> 01:50:44.938 region:rollup2
IT WORKS FOR SOME AND IT DOESN'T

01:50:42.936 --> 01:50:46.740 region:rollup2
WORK FOR OTHERS SO. THERE IS

01:50:44.938 --> 01:50:48.942 region:rollup2
ALREADY STAFF THERE THAT TEST

01:50:46.740 --> 01:50:50.811 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT TELLS US AND YOU

01:50:48.942 --> 01:50:51.145 region:rollup2
KNOW WE SHOULD BE RAISING THESE

01:50:50.811 --> 01:50:54.982 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS SO.

01:50:51.145 --> 01:50:57.417 region:rollup2
THANK YOU THOUGH.

01:50:54.982 --> 01:50:59.953 region:rollup2

TO THE.

01:51:04.558 --> 01:51:07.528 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION.

01:51:06.293 --> 01:51:09.062 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS LIKE TO ME THE CONCERNS

01:51:07.528 --> 01:51:10.097 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:51:09.062 --> 01:51:11.732 region:rollup2
AND THREE THREE DIFFERENT

01:51:10.097 --> 01:51:13.567 region:rollup2
DIRECTIONS.

01:51:11.732 --> 01:51:15.068 region:rollup2
FIRST ONE I I WOULD SAY IS.

01:51:13.567 --> 01:51:16.136 region:rollup2
.

01:51:15.068 --> 01:51:18.238 region:rollup2
ONE THAT WE JUST HAD A

01:51:16.136 --> 01:51:19.740 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION ON. THE.

01:51:18.238 --> 01:51:21.808 region:rollup2
PETTY GOLLY GEE.

01:51:19.740 --> 01:51:23.377 region:rollup2
OF OR THE WAY WE REACH STUDENTS

01:51:21.808 --> 01:51:25.212 region:rollup2
THE WAY WE TEACH.

01:51:23.377 --> 01:51:27.414 region:rollup2
AND.

01:51:25.212 --> 01:51:29.283 region:rollup2
AND AS A MISTER CHAVEZ WAS

01:51:27.414 --> 01:51:31.985 region:rollup2
SPEAKING ABOUT THE MILITARY. AN

01:51:29.283 --> 01:51:34.421 region:rollup2
ONLINE AYE AYE REMEMBERING MY

01:51:31.985 --> 01:51:35.923 region:rollup2
HIGH SCHOOL EXPERIENCE AND ARMY

01:51:34.421 --> 01:51:38.125 region:rollup2
ROTC.

01:51:35.923 --> 01:51:40.527 region:rollup2
AND I LEARNED TO TAKE APART AND

01:51:38.125 --> 01:51:43.564 region:rollup2
PUT TOGETHER THE M. ONE RIFLE

01:51:40.527 --> 01:51:44.998 region:rollup2
THAT'S HOW OLD. FOR LONG AGO.

01:51:43.564 --> 01:51:46.567 region:rollup2
I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL THAT WAS

01:51:44.998 --> 01:51:48.735 region:rollup2
THE M. ONE RIFLE.

01:51:46.567 --> 01:51:50.404 region:rollup2
BUT IF I HAD TO LEARN HOW TO

01:51:48.735 --> 01:51:53.140 region:rollup2
TAKE APART AND PUT TOGETHER THE

01:51:50.404 --> 01:51:54.007 region:rollup2
M. ONE RIFLE I DON'T THINK I

01:51:53.140 --> 01:51:56.443 region:rollup2
COULD HAVE LEARNED HOW TO HAVE

01:51:54.007 --> 01:51:56.677 region:rollup2
DONE THAT. ONLINE.

01:51:56.443 --> 01:51:58.845 region:rollup2
AND AND.

01:51:56.677 --> 01:52:00.013 region:rollup2
.

01:51:58.845 --> 01:52:02.149 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE

01:52:00.013 --> 01:52:04.117 region:rollup2
MILITARY TEACHES THOSE KIND OF

01:52:02.149 --> 01:52:05.586 region:rollup2
THINGS ONLINE.

01:52:04.117 --> 01:52:08.589 region:rollup2
AND AND THOSE SO THAT GOES TO

01:52:05.586 --> 01:52:10.958 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION OF HOW. YOU LEARN.

01:52:08.589 --> 01:52:12.693 region:rollup2
AND HOW INDIVIDUALS LEARN AND

01:52:10.958 --> 01:52:14.227 region:rollup2
THE NEED FOR HANDS ON.

01:52:12.693 --> 01:52:16.630 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S THAT'S THE FIRST

01:52:14.227 --> 01:52:18.231 region:rollup2
CATEGORY. YOU KNOW OUR OURS ARE

01:52:16.630 --> 01:52:20.634 region:rollup2
LEARNERS REALLY GOING TO BE ABLE

01:52:18.231 --> 01:52:21.235 region:rollup2
TO USE THEIR PHONES.

01:52:20.634 --> 01:52:25.472 region:rollup2
TO A ACCESS EDUCATION IS THIS.

01:52:21.235 --> 01:52:27.541 region:rollup2
A.

01:52:25.472 --> 01:52:29.643 region:rollup2
I'M NOT.

01:52:27.541 --> 01:52:31.378 region:rollup2
IS THIS LITTLE DEVICE ENOUGH WAY

01:52:29.643 --> 01:52:33.247 region:rollup2
TO LEARN PERHAPS COMPLICATED

01:52:31.378 --> 01:52:34.815 region:rollup2
INFORMATION.

01:52:33.247 --> 01:52:37.117 region:rollup2
AND THAT THAT GOES ALSO TO.

01:52:34.815 --> 01:52:38.685 region:rollup2
ACCESS.

01:52:37.117 --> 01:52:40.520 region:rollup2
SO THAT THAT'S I THINK THAT'S

01:52:38.685 --> 01:52:42.789 region:rollup2
THE FIRST QUESTION THAT IT'S IN

01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:44.825 region:rollup2
MY MIND. THE SECOND IS AS WE'VE

01:52:42.789 --> 01:52:45.692 region:rollup2
MENTIONED GOVERNMENTS.

01:52:44.825 --> 01:52:48.428 region:rollup2
ACCREDITATION.

01:52:45.692 --> 01:52:51.298 region:rollup2
.

01:52:48.428 --> 01:52:52.766 region:rollup2
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE FOR THIS

01:52:51.298 --> 01:52:54.835 region:rollup2
ENTITY TO GET ACCREDITED?

01:52:52.766 --> 01:52:57.204 region:rollup2
?

01:52:54.835 --> 01:52:59.206 region:rollup2
WHO DOES IT COMPETE WITH?

01:52:57.204 --> 01:53:01.141 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THE THIRD IS FINANCE

01:52:59.206 --> 01:53:03.377 region:rollup2
WHERE WHERE DOES THIS. COME MAN

01:53:01.141 --> 01:53:04.211 region:rollup2
WITH THE. WITH PROP NINETY EIGHT

01:53:03.377 --> 01:53:06.446 region:rollup2
FUNDING

01:53:04.211 --> 01:53:08.415 region:rollup2
IS THIS TAKING MONEY FROM PROP

01:53:06.446 --> 01:53:10.417 region:rollup2
NINETY EIGHT IS IS TAKING MONEY

GOVERNANCE.

WATCHED AND WITH A C. JC. ó WE

01:55:03.096 --> 01:55:07.634 region:rollup2
THINK WE CAN MOVE THROUGH THAT

01:55:04.798 --> 01:55:10.303 region:rollup2
PROCESS RELATIVELY QUICKLY.

01:55:07.634 --> 01:55:12.439 region:rollup2

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS WELL.

01:55:20.113 --> 01:55:22.983 region:rollup2
TO THE FIRST QUESTION OF

01:55:21.381 --> 01:55:24.584 region:rollup2
PEDAGOGY. IS THIS THE BEST WAY

01:55:22.983 --> 01:55:25.318 region:rollup2
TO LEARN.

01:55:24.584 --> 01:55:27.454 region:rollup2
SO.

01:55:25.318 --> 01:55:29.523 region:rollup2
MEMBER MEDINA AYE AYE I

01:55:27.454 --> 01:55:32.025 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THAT AND AND I I

01:55:29.523 --> 01:55:32.325 region:rollup2
THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE THAT.

01:55:32.025 --> 01:55:34.661 region:rollup2
THE IPHONE.

01:55:32.325 --> 01:55:36.096 region:rollup2
.

01:55:34.661 --> 01:55:38.165 region:rollup2
CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT BE A

01:55:36.096 --> 01:55:39.633 region:rollup2
REPLACEMENT.

01:55:38.165 --> 01:55:41.268 region:rollup2
FOR.

01:55:39.633 --> 01:55:44.137 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

CLASSROOM INSTRUCTORS.

01:55:46.072 --> 01:55:50.110 region:rollup2
.

01:55:48.475 --> 01:55:51.978 region:rollup2
THAT THE CHALLENGE IS.

01:55:50.110 --> 01:55:54.080 region:rollup2
INTEREST WELL LET ME SAY THAT I

01:55:51.978 --> 01:55:55.549 region:rollup2
DON'T BELIEVE THE IPHONE WOULD

01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:57.150 region:rollup2
BE THE PLACE TO LEARN.

01:55:55.549 --> 01:55:58.819 region:rollup2
A COMPLICATED SUBJECT GROWTH

01:55:57.150 --> 01:56:01.054 region:rollup2
SUBJECT THAT REQUIRES EXTENSIVE.

01:55:58.819 --> 01:56:02.422 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTION.

01:56:01.054 --> 01:56:03.690 region:rollup2
BUT CAN BE A PLACE TO LEARN SOFT

01:56:02.422 --> 01:56:05.625 region:rollup2
SKILLS.

01:56:03.690 --> 01:56:07.594 region:rollup2
IT CAN BE A PLACE

01:56:05.625 --> 01:56:08.895 region:rollup2
TO MASTERS SOME RUDIMENTARY

01:56:07.594 --> 01:56:10.330 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES AROUND THE

01:56:08.895 --> 01:56:11.965 region:rollup2
USE.

01:56:10.330 --> 01:56:13.366 region:rollup2
AN ACCESS TO THE INTERNET THE

01:56:11.965 --> 01:56:15.969 region:rollup2
USE OF A BROWSER.

01:56:13.366 --> 01:56:16.803 region:rollup2
WHICH MANY OF THESE WORKERS

01:56:15.969 --> 01:56:18.205 region:rollup2
LACK EVEN THOSE FUNDAMENTAL

01:56:16.803 --> 01:56:20.040 region:rollup2
SKILLS.

01:56:18.205 --> 01:56:21.475 region:rollup2
SO.

01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:24.211 region:rollup2
WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS IN TERMS

01:56:21.475 --> 01:56:25.879 region:rollup2
OF ALL THE TOOLS AVAILABLE.

01:56:24.211 --> 01:56:28.081 region:rollup2
THAT AN INDIVIDUAL COULD HAVE

01:56:25.879 --> 01:56:29.382 region:rollup2
AND TAILORING. THE INSTRUCTION

01:56:28.081 --> 01:56:30.784 region:rollup2
TO THE TOOLS THAT WOULD BE

01:56:29.382 --> 01:56:32.319 region:rollup2
NECESSARY.

01:56:30.784 --> 01:56:33.854 region:rollup2
FOR HIGHER LEVEL INSTRUCTION WE

01:56:32.319 --> 01:56:35.322 region:rollup2
WOULD ABSOLUTELY NEED THE

01:56:33.854 --> 01:56:36.356 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL TO BE CONNECTED

01:56:35.322 --> 01:56:39.659 region:rollup2

TO ACCOMPLISH THAT.

01:56:45.465 --> 01:56:48.768 region:rollup2
BUT THERE ARE SOME FUNDAMENTAL

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:50.503 region:rollup2
SKILLS THAT INDIVIDUAL COULD

01:56:48.768 --> 01:56:52.372 region:rollup2
LEARN. AND COULD MASTER ON THE

IPHONE SO.

01:56:52.372 --> 01:56:55.575 region:rollup2

01:57:12.759 --> 01:57:18.498 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS ONLINE LEARNING.

01:57:15.362 --> 01:57:19.399 region:rollup2
.

01:57:18.498 --> 01:57:20.967 region:rollup2
OLDER PEOPLE BECAUSE WE'RE

01:57:19.399 --> 01:57:22.802 region:rollup2
TALKING PEOPLE RIGHT HERE TWENTY

01:57:20.967 --> 01:57:24.137 region:rollup2
FIVE TO THIRTY FOUR WERE NOT AS

01:57:22.802 --> 01:57:25.539 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF THE DICE

01:57:24.137 --> 01:57:27.908 region:rollup2
REFERRING SAN ONLINE.

01:57:25.539 --> 01:57:28.875 region:rollup2
ISN'T BEST FOR YOUNG PEOPLE I

01:57:27.908 --> 01:57:30.076 region:rollup2
SEEN THOSE STUDIES SPECIAL

01:57:28.875 --> 01:57:31.711 region:rollup2
ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS

01:57:30.076 --> 01:57:33.380 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING TWENTY FIVE TO

01:57:31.711 --> 01:57:35.048 region:rollup2
THIRTY FIVE FOUR YEAR OLD ARE

01:57:33.380 --> 01:57:36.216 region:rollup2
YOU ARE MANY SIZES SHOW.

01:57:35.048 --> 01:57:38.451 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO ADVANTAGE OR

01:57:36.216 --> 01:57:40.553 region:rollup2
DISADVANTAGE ONLINE LET ME.

01:57:38.451 --> 01:57:41.187 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THERE ARE A VARIETY

01:57:40.553 --> 01:57:42.389 region:rollup2
OF STUDIES THAT TRY TO MEASURE.

01:57:41.187 --> 01:57:43.556 region:rollup2
.

01:57:42.389 --> 01:57:44.991 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE IN THE CLASSROOM

01:57:43.556 --> 01:57:46.259 region:rollup2
VERSUS ONLINE INCOME LOOK AT

01:57:44.991 --> 01:57:47.427 region:rollup2
THOSE GAPS I THINK WITH

01:57:46.259 --> 01:57:49.596 region:rollup2
VIRTUALLY ALL GROUPS THERE'S A

01:57:47.427 --> 01:57:51.231 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT LOWER. PERFORMANCE.

01:57:49.596 --> 01:57:52.832 region:rollup2
ONLINE THAN THAN IN PERSON

01:57:51.231 --> 01:57:54.301 region:rollup2
THOUGH THAT GAP HAS BEEN CLOSING

01:57:52.832 --> 01:57:56.069 region:rollup2
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS.

01:57:54.301 --> 01:57:57.203 region:rollup2
AND A BUT ONE OF THE IT'S ALL OF

01:57:56.069 --> 01:57:59.039 region:rollup2
THAT IS THE CAT SO HOW BIG THAT

01:57:57.203 --> 01:57:59.673 region:rollup2
GAP AND FOR DIFFERENT

01:57:59.039 --> 01:58:02.242 region:rollup2
DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS ACTUALLY FOR

01:57:59.673 --> 01:58:03.310 region:rollup2
OLDER. FOR OLDER ADULTS.

01:58:02.242 --> 01:58:05.145 region:rollup2
THEY TENDED.

01:58:03.310 --> 01:58:06.379 region:rollup2
YOU BETTER TO HAVE A LOWER DROP

01:58:05.145 --> 01:58:08.048 region:rollup2
OFF IN PERFORMANCE AND FROM THAT

01:58:06.379 --> 01:58:09.316 region:rollup2
WITH SOME OF THE STUDIES SHOW. I

01:58:08.048 --> 01:58:10.417 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THERE WITH AN A IN

01:58:09.316 --> 01:58:12.953 region:rollup2
THE THIRTIES I THOUGHT THAT WAS

01:58:10.417 --> 01:58:14.421 region:rollup2
A SPECIFIC REASON. FOR OUR THAT

01:58:12.953 --> 01:58:15.588 region:rollup2
THEY COULD BECKETT SPECIFICALLY

01:58:14.421 --> 01:58:16.957 region:rollup2
TIE BUT ONE THOUGHT IS THAT

01:58:15.588 --> 01:58:18.091 region:rollup2
OLDER ADULTS WHO CAMINO EXACTLY

01:58:16.957 --> 01:58:19.059 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY YOU KNOW THEY HAVE THE

01:58:18.091 --> 01:58:20.994 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINE THEY KNOW WHAT

01:58:19.059 --> 01:58:22.462 region:rollup2
THEY'RE. WHAT THEY'RE HERE TO DO

01:58:20.994 --> 01:58:23.930 region:rollup2
AND SO THEY CAN BE MORE FOCUSED

01:58:22.462 --> 01:58:24.764 region:rollup2
THAN I AM INTO COMBAT COURSE SO

01:58:23.930 --> 01:58:26.232 region:rollup2
THERE IS?

01:58:24.764 --> 01:58:27.701 region:rollup2
THUMB.

01:58:26.232 --> 01:58:29.235 region:rollup2
CITY THE SHOW THAT I THINK IN

01:58:27.701 --> 01:58:30.904 region:rollup2
IN IN GENERAL.

01:58:29.235 --> 01:58:32.205 region:rollup2
OLDER ADULT THEMES HAVE THEM

01:58:30.904 --> 01:58:34.207 region:rollup2
BETTER ON SOME OF THE LAWMAKERS

01:58:32.205 --> 01:58:35.909 region:rollup2
I REFER TO THE ROUGH YOUR STUDY.

01:58:34.207 --> 01:58:37.644 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT SHOWS ADULTS DO

01:58:35.909 --> 01:58:38.411 region:rollup2
BETTER ON ONLINE SO MAYBE FOR

01:58:37.644 --> 01:58:40.146 region:rollup2
ENGLISH LANGUAGE OUR YOUNG

01:58:38.411 --> 01:58:41.448 region:rollup2
PEOPLE BUT FOR THE GROUP THAT

01:58:40.146 --> 01:58:43.617 region:rollup2
WE'RE LOOKING AT BETWEEN TWENTY

01:58:41.448 --> 01:58:47.320 region:rollup2
FIVE AND THIRTY FOR THE STUDIES

01:58:43.617 --> 01:58:51.191 region:rollup2
SHOW. THAT ARE ONLINE LEARNING

01:58:47.320 --> 01:58:51.424 region:rollup2
CAN OFTEN BE ENHANCE FOR OLDER

01:58:51.191 --> 01:58:52.092 region:rollup2
ADULTS.

01:58:51.424 --> 01:58:52.659 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION WE THE ISSUE ABOUT A

01:58:52.092 --> 01:58:53.293 region:rollup2
LEARNING DETAIL COMPLICATED

01:58:52.659 --> 01:58:53.760 region:rollup2
THINGS.

01:58:53.293 --> 01:58:55.195 region:rollup2
I LEARNED HOW DO WE.

01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:56.363 region:rollup2

ONLINE.

01:58:59.432 --> 01:59:02.736 region:rollup2
AND THE DETAILS ON THAT IS VERY

01:59:01.568 --> 01:59:04.704 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC IN ITS NOT SOMETHING

01:59:02.736 --> 01:59:06.306 region:rollup2
YOU WANNA.

MOST OF THESE HAVE BEEN HIT. I I

01:59:38.238 --> 01:59:40.874 region:rollup2
DO THINK YOU YOU OVER OVERALL

01:59:40.306 --> 01:59:42.676 region:rollup2

ALL.

01:59:42.676 --> 01:59:46.179 region:rollup2
WE ALL CARE ABOUT IS HOW DO WE

01:59:44.077 --> 01:59:48.048 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT MORE PEOPLE IN

HIGH SCHOOL.

01:59:51.317 --> 01:59:54.454 region:rollup2
THE FOCUS ON THE JOBS OF TODAY

01:59:53.086 --> 01:59:56.489 region:rollup2
AND TOMORROW BECAUSE THIS

01:59:54.454 --> 01:59:58.258 region:rollup2
ECONOMY REWARDS PEOPLE WITH MORE

01:59:56.489 --> 01:59:59.559 region:rollup2
EDUCATION BUT CONVERSELY AND

01:59:58.258 --> 02:00:01.895 region:rollup2
MORE IMPORTANTLY IT PUNISHES

01:59:59.559 --> 02:00:02.862 region:rollup2
THOSE. WITHOUT EDUCATION BEYOND

02:00:01.895 --> 02:00:04.898 region:rollup2
HIGH SCHOOL.

02:00:02.862 --> 02:00:05.398 region:rollup2
AND THEN I I AGREE THAT ARE

02:00:04.898 --> 02:00:06.699 region:rollup2
PROBABLY PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:00:05.398 --> 02:00:08.068 region:rollup2
STRANDED.

02:00:06.699 --> 02:00:09.536 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW YOU LOOK AT THAT

02:00:08.068 --> 02:00:11.905 region:rollup2
THE YOUR YOUR MAP HERE AS KNOW

02:00:09.536 --> 02:00:13.873 region:rollup2
SOME POPULATION BASES SAN DIEGO

02:00:11.905 --> 02:00:15.608 region:rollup2
ALL A. RIVERSIDE SACRAMENTO THE

02:00:13.873 --> 02:00:17.210 region:rollup2
BAY AREA THEY HAVE A LOT OF

02:00:15.608 --> 02:00:18.411 region:rollup2
COLLEGE OPPORTUNITIES BUT ONE

02:00:17.210 --> 02:00:19.879 region:rollup2
THING THAT'S GREAT ABOUT THE

02:00:18.411 --> 02:00:21.181 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE CALLED SYSTEMS HUNDRED

02:00:19.879 --> 02:00:22.482 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN COLLEGES.

02:00:21.181 --> 02:00:24.184 region:rollup2
IS WHETHER YOU'RE UKIAH READING

SONORA.

02:00:24.184 --> 02:00:27.721 region:rollup2
A BAKERSFIELD WE DO HAVE

02:00:26.119 --> 02:00:28.755 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES THERE TOO SO

02:00:27.721 --> 02:00:30.423 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE STRANDED

02:00:28.755 --> 02:00:32.125 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THAT'S WHY WE HAVE ONE

02:00:30.423 --> 02:00:34.060 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN ONE.

02:00:32.125 --> 02:00:35.829 region:rollup2
ONE FOURTEEN ACROSS THE STATE

02:00:34.060 --> 02:00:37.464 region:rollup2
AND DAMN I THINK YOU KNOW WE

02:00:35.829 --> 02:00:39.332 region:rollup2
RAISED A GOOD QUESTION IS WHY

02:00:37.464 --> 02:00:40.667 region:rollup2
ISN'T IT WORKING FOR THE

02:00:39.332 --> 02:00:42.869 region:rollup2

YOU KNOW CURRENTLY IN AN AND I

02:00:52.545 --> 02:00:55.849 region:rollup2
DO THINK THAT YOU RAISE A

02:00:55.281 --> 02:00:57.016 region:rollup2
QUESTION THAT I AM CONCERNED

02:00:55.849 --> 02:00:58.952 region:rollup2
ABOUT IS FOR THE POOR FOR PROFIT

02:00:57.016 --> 02:00:59.419 region:rollup2

SAYING FOR FEARS IS.

02:00:59.419 --> 02:01:02.255 region:rollup2
IS.

02:01:01.354 --> 02:01:03.123 region:rollup2
THERE ARE DEPLORABLE IN MANY

02:01:02.255 --> 02:01:05.091 region:rollup2
WAYS.

02:01:03.123 --> 02:01:07.127 region:rollup2
SAY STRAIGHT UP.

02:01:05.091 --> 02:01:10.096 region:rollup2

THESE FOR PROFIT COLLEGES ARE

02:01:42.896 --> 02:01:46.533 region:rollup2

DO SOMETHING DRAMATIC AND MATURE

02:01:50.036 --> 02:01:53.072 region:rollup2
IF INSTANT ADMINISTRATORS

NOT SERVING. THE STUDENT NEEDS I

02:01:55.575 --> 02:01:58.645 region:rollup2
THINK WE SHOULD HAVE SOME

02:01:56.976 --> 02:02:00.713 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATIVE PROGRAM TO START.

02:01:58.645 --> 02:02:01.281 region:rollup2
ON A MORE FREQUENT BASIS

02:02:00.713 --> 02:02:02.682 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY WHEN A DEAL WITH

02:02:01.281 --> 02:02:03.216 region:rollup2
THESE.

02:02:02.682 --> 02:02:05.051 region:rollup2
STRANDED.

02:02:03.216 --> 02:02:06.619 region:rollup2
ADULTS AS FAR AS HIGHER

02:02:05.051 --> 02:02:08.087 region:rollup2
EDUCATION NEEDS OUT SO I GET

02:02:06.619 --> 02:02:08.888 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:02:08.087 --> 02:02:11.291 region:rollup2
I DO THINK THAT.

RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THAT AS

02:02:15.895 --> 02:02:18.965 region:rollup2
MYSTERY MAN SAID THAT THAT.

02:02:17.263 --> 02:02:19.933 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS AS FAR

02:02:18.965 --> 02:02:21.868 region:rollup2
AS THE POPULATION WERE TRYING TO

02:02:19.933 --> 02:02:23.636 region:rollup2
REACH.

02:02:21.868 --> 02:02:25.138 region:rollup2
STORK TRANSIT BEING SUCCESSFUL

02:02:23.636 --> 02:02:26.372 region:rollup2
THE SERVICES THEY NEED AN EVEN

LA VICTORIA'S NOT NOT DOING HER.

02:03:11.517 --> 02:03:14.654 region:rollup2
THINGS WENT TERRACE WHAT HAPPENS

02:03:13.152 --> 02:03:16.256 region:rollup2
LIKE NO NO NO I SHOULD WE HAVE

02:03:14.654 --> 02:03:18.024 region:rollup2
AN OLD IPHONE SHE TOOK IT FOR A

FEW DAYS SHE WENT DINNER. THING

02:03:18.024 --> 02:03:21.261 region:rollup2
BUT IT WASN'T CONNECTING

02:03:19.092 --> 02:03:22.328 region:rollup2
PROPERLY DID DID AND SHE WASN'T

02:03:21.261 --> 02:03:23.696 region:rollup2
ABLE TO PRESS THE SAME BUTTONS

02:03:22.328 --> 02:03:26.432 region:rollup2
AS WE DO WITH THE COMPUTER

02:03:23.696 --> 02:03:28.401 region:rollup2
INTERFACE AND SO. JUST SIMPLE.

02:03:26.432 --> 02:03:29.569 region:rollup2
ON LOGISTICS.

02:03:28.401 --> 02:03:30.770 region:rollup2
WHO LIKE THAT ON?

02:03:29.569 --> 02:03:31.838 region:rollup2
BUT I DO HAVE TO QUESTION THE

02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:32.672 region:rollup2
ONE I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE

02:03:31.838 --> 02:03:35.808 region:rollup2
CHANCE TO TO TO ANSWER THE.

02:03:32.672 --> 02:03:36.676 region:rollup2
AND THAT.

02:03:35.808 --> 02:03:38.278 region:rollup2
IT WON'T WORK WHERE WE'VE HEARD

02:03:36.676 --> 02:03:39.779 region:rollup2
FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE

02:03:38.278 --> 02:03:41.447 region:rollup2
STATE.

02:03:39.779 --> 02:03:44.350 region:rollup2
SOME YOU CAN BE CALLED DISTRICTS

02:03:41.447 --> 02:03:46.319 region:rollup2
THAT ARE. ARE VERY CONCERNED SO.

02:03:44.350 --> 02:03:48.321 region:rollup2
.

02:03:46.319 --> 02:03:49.555 region:rollup2
WHY ARE THEY SO CONCERNS

02:03:48.321 --> 02:03:50.957 region:rollup2
AND WHY ARE THEY POTENTIALLY

02:03:49.555 --> 02:03:52.425 region:rollup2
WRONG?

02:03:50.957 --> 02:03:54.961 region:rollup2
AND AND WHY DO THEY BELIEVE THAT

02:03:52.425 --> 02:03:56.596 region:rollup2
THIS WILL WILL HARM THEM PRISON

02:03:54.961 --> 02:03:57.997 region:rollup2
BARS THEY'RE TEETERING DISTRICTS

02:03:56.596 --> 02:04:00.500 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS AND ROMANTICS.

02:03:57.997 --> 02:04:02.769 region:rollup2
DECLINING POPULATION BASE

02:04:00.500 --> 02:04:03.970 region:rollup2
THEY SOME OF THEM FEW THAT. YOU

02:04:02.769 --> 02:04:04.337 region:rollup2
I'VE HEARD THIS AT THIS COULD BE

02:04:03.970 --> 02:04:06.572 region:rollup2
THE. DEATH KNELL

02:04:04.337 --> 02:04:08.107 region:rollup2
SOME OF THEM.

02:04:06.572 --> 02:04:10.243 region:rollup2
THAT THERE THEIR ENROLLMENT IN

02:04:08.107 --> 02:04:12.111 region:rollup2
THERE JUST STAYING AFLOAT AND

02:04:10.243 --> 02:04:14.447 region:rollup2
WHY ARE THEY WRONG.

02:04:12.111 --> 02:04:16.049 region:rollup2
SO FIRST OF ALL LET ME SAY THAT.

02:04:14.447 --> 02:04:18.017 region:rollup2
.

02:04:16.049 --> 02:04:21.454 region:rollup2
I I ABSOLUTELY RESPECT.

02:04:18.017 --> 02:04:22.088 region:rollup2
THE OPINIONS AND THE CONCERNS

02:04:21.454 --> 02:04:23.523 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED FROM MY

02:04:22.088 --> 02:04:26.192 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES IN THE SYSTEM.

02:04:23.523 --> 02:04:28.194 region:rollup2
.

02:04:26.192 --> 02:04:31.464 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE THAT THIS ANXIETY THIS

02:04:28.194 --> 02:04:33.866 region:rollup2
CONCERN COMES FROM A PLACE OF.

02:04:31.464 --> 02:04:35.201 region:rollup2
OF NOT BEING.

02:04:33.866 --> 02:04:37.203 region:rollup2
SURE THAT.

02:04:35.201 --> 02:04:39.138 region:rollup2
THE THE WAY THAT THEY'RE

02:04:37.203 --> 02:04:41.541 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY FUNDED WILL CONTINUE

02:04:39.138 --> 02:04:44.377 region:rollup2
TO SUPPORT THEIR OPERATION.

02:04:41.541 --> 02:04:45.511 region:rollup2
SO. IN MY MIND.

02:04:44.377 --> 02:04:48.247 region:rollup2
AND CERTAINLY CONCERNS I'VE

02:04:45.511 --> 02:04:49.716 region:rollup2
HEARD FROM THEM ARE THAT IF WE

02:04:48.247 --> 02:04:51.351 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT THIS NEW.

02:04:49.716 --> 02:04:53.486 region:rollup2
PLATFORM THIS NEW ORGANIZATION

02:04:51.351 --> 02:04:55.855 region:rollup2
THIS NEW COLLEGE.

02:04:53.486 --> 02:04:58.257 region:rollup2
THAT THEY FEAR THAT IT WILL.

02:04:55.855 --> 02:05:00.493 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY.

02:04:58.257 --> 02:05:02.328 region:rollup2
ROB THEM OF THEIR ROMANCE.

02:05:00.493 --> 02:05:04.130 region:rollup2
SO.

02:05:02.328 --> 02:05:06.199 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WITH THAT TO.

02:05:04.130 --> 02:05:08.368 region:rollup2
CONCERN ISN'T

02:05:06.199 --> 02:05:10.503 region:rollup2
DAMAGE INDIVIDUALS EXPRESSING A

02:05:08.368 --> 02:05:12.672 region:rollup2
CONCERN THE PROBLEM IS.

02:05:10.503 --> 02:05:13.706 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM THAT WE'VE CREATE.

02:05:12.672 --> 02:05:15.908 region:rollup2
THAT RELY SO HEAVILY ON

02:05:13.706 --> 02:05:17.643 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT.

02:05:15.908 --> 02:05:19.846 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF RELYING AND PROVIDING

02:05:17.643 --> 02:05:20.480 region:rollup2
THE RESOURCES NECESSARY FOR THE

02:05:19.846 --> 02:05:21.180 region:rollup2
COLLEGES TO DO THE MISSION THAT

02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:23.216 region:rollup2
THERE.

02:05:21.180 --> 02:05:25.585 region:rollup2
I HAVE TO DO.

02:05:23.216 --> 02:05:26.219 region:rollup2
SO I THINK PART OF THE CHALLENGE

02:05:25.585 --> 02:05:27.320 region:rollup2
IS THE CURRENT CONTEXT THAT WERE

02:05:26.219 --> 02:05:29.989 region:rollup2
IN.

02:05:27.320 --> 02:05:31.624 region:rollup2
AS LONG AS WE CONTINUE TO ONLY

02:05:29.989 --> 02:05:33.693 region:rollup2
RELY ON ENROLLMENT FOR GROWTH IN

02:05:31.624 --> 02:05:35.661 region:rollup2
REVENUES.

02:05:33.693 --> 02:05:37.663 region:rollup2
THEN COLLEGES ARE EXPRESSING AND

02:05:35.661 --> 02:05:40.299 region:rollup2
NATURAL ANXIETY.

02:05:37.663 --> 02:05:42.668 region:rollup2
WHICH IS.

02:05:40.299 --> 02:05:45.138 region:rollup2
WILL THIS NEW INSTITUTION TAKE

02:05:42.668 --> 02:05:46.239 region:rollup2
STUDENTS AWAY FROM MY COLLEGE.

02:05:45.138 --> 02:05:47.673 region:rollup2
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEIR

02:05:46.239 --> 02:05:49.108 region:rollup2
ANXIETY CENTERS ON WHETHER OR

02:05:47.673 --> 02:05:50.877 region:rollup2
NOT.

02:05:49.108 --> 02:05:53.279 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD.

02:05:50.877 --> 02:05:54.781 region:rollup2
REACHES POPULATION I BELIEVE

02:05:53.279 --> 02:05:57.283 region:rollup2
THEIR CONCERN COMES FROM THIS

02:05:54.781 --> 02:05:59.152 region:rollup2
NOTION SO. I'M NOT SAYING THAT

02:05:57.283 --> 02:06:01.721 region:rollup2
THEIR CONCERNS ARE WRONG I'M

02:05:59.152 --> 02:06:03.089 region:rollup2
SAYING THAT WE AS A SYSTEM. OR

02:06:01.721 --> 02:06:05.625 region:rollup2
CREATING THIS CONCERN THAT IT'S

02:06:03.089 --> 02:06:07.226 region:rollup2
COMING FROM THE WRONG PLACE YEAH

02:06:05.625 --> 02:06:09.529 region:rollup2
IRIS AS MISTER CHAVEZ SAYS

02:06:07.226 --> 02:06:10.463 region:rollup2
CHANGE IS HARD. DELAYS THAT OLD

02:06:09.529 --> 02:06:11.664 region:rollup2
SAYING THAT.

02:06:10.463 --> 02:06:13.199 region:rollup2
ABOUT CHANGE IN A HALF THE

02:06:11.664 --> 02:06:13.599 region:rollup2
PEOPLE.

02:06:13.199 --> 02:06:16.202 region:rollup2
OUR.

02:06:13.599 --> 02:06:18.604 region:rollup2
CAUTIOUSLY LIKE YOU.

02:06:16.202 --> 02:06:19.939 region:rollup2
I'M OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE SUCCESS

02:06:18.604 --> 02:06:21.674 region:rollup2
AND PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT CHANGE

02:06:19.939 --> 02:06:23.309 region:rollup2
OUR ONE CERTAIN ONE HUNDRED

02:06:21.674 --> 02:06:25.211 region:rollup2
PERCENT CERTAIN AS FAR AS THE.

02:06:23.309 --> 02:06:26.646 region:rollup2
NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF THOSE THESE

02:06:25.211 --> 02:06:29.015 region:rollup2
THINK THINGS TOGETHER. AND YOU

02:06:26.646 --> 02:06:30.483 region:rollup2
KNOW.

02:06:29.015 --> 02:06:33.219 region:rollup2
MAKE MAKE THE ISSUE DAUNTING.

02:06:30.483 --> 02:06:34.454 region:rollup2
THE OTHER QUESTION THAT THAT.

02:06:33.219 --> 02:06:35.288 region:rollup2
I'LL THAT YOU PROBABLY ANSWERED.

02:06:34.454 --> 02:06:37.390 region:rollup2
AND THESE ARE.

02:06:35.288 --> 02:06:39.492 region:rollup2
QUESTION

02:06:37.390 --> 02:06:40.927 region:rollup2
SO BUT DOES IT MEAN THAT MIGHT

02:06:39.492 --> 02:06:42.261 region:rollup2
GET AYE CONCERNS ARE ARE ARE

02:06:40.927 --> 02:06:44.430 region:rollup2
THAT BUT I'LL I'LL I'LL GIVE YOU

02:06:42.261 --> 02:06:47.567 region:rollup2
A CHANCE TO TO ADDRESS THIS IS.

02:06:44.430 --> 02:06:49.502 region:rollup2
WHY CAN'T THE EXISTING COMMUNITY

02:06:47.567 --> 02:06:50.002 region:rollup2
COLLEGE SYSTEM?

02:06:49.502 --> 02:06:50.503 region:rollup2
AND THE HUNDRED FOURTEEN

02:06:50.002 --> 02:06:52.572 region:rollup2
COLLEGES.

02:06:50.503 --> 02:06:53.739 region:rollup2
.

02:06:52.572 --> 02:06:56.409 region:rollup2
WHY CAN'T THEY DO THIS WHY CAN'T

02:06:53.739 --> 02:06:58.411 region:rollup2
WE EXPAND THERE ARE RESOURCES

02:06:56.409 --> 02:07:01.080 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE ONLINE PROGRAMS?

02:06:58.411 --> 02:07:01.280 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY THEY ALREADY HAVE.

02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:03.449 region:rollup2
THE.

02:07:01.280 --> 02:07:04.650 region:rollup2
THAT ACCREDITATION ISSUES WHERE

02:07:03.449 --> 02:07:06.452 region:rollup2
THE FINANCIAL AID REVEALED TO

02:07:04.650 --> 02:07:08.521 region:rollup2
GET THERE FROM THE GATE THE RD

02:07:06.452 --> 02:07:10.490 region:rollup2
HAVE THE SUPPORT SERVICES.

02:07:08.521 --> 02:07:12.892 region:rollup2
THAT THE FAMILY MEMBERS IN THAT.

02:07:10.490 --> 02:07:14.894 region:rollup2
THEN THAT. STUDENT POPULATION

02:07:12.892 --> 02:07:17.430 region:rollup2
KNOWS ABOUT THAT THE HISTORY IN

02:07:14.894 --> 02:07:18.664 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNION WHAT THIS PLACE IS

02:07:17.430 --> 02:07:20.967 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE A BRAND NAME.

02:07:18.664 --> 02:07:21.968 region:rollup2
.

02:07:20.967 --> 02:07:24.137 region:rollup2
AND THEN THEY COULD HAVE.

02:07:21.968 --> 02:07:26.572 region:rollup2
HYBRID TYPE CLASSES WHERE YOU

02:07:24.137 --> 02:07:28.341 region:rollup2
CAN GO IN PERSON ACTUALLY SEEING

02:07:26.572 --> 02:07:30.343 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY AND RESEARCH SHOWS THAT

02:07:28.341 --> 02:07:31.777 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ARE ACTUALLY HAVE THAT.

02:07:30.343 --> 02:07:32.278 region:rollup2
DO MUCH BETTER THAN PURE ONLINE

02:07:31.777 --> 02:07:34.714 region:rollup2
SO WHY CAN'T WE USE THE

02:07:32.278 --> 02:07:36.949 region:rollup2
EXISTING.

02:07:34.714 --> 02:07:38.951 region:rollup2
CAN BE CALLED SYSTEM AND

02:07:36.949 --> 02:07:41.320 region:rollup2
AUGMENT THAT TO MAKEUP AND A

02:07:38.951 --> 02:07:43.756 region:rollup2
STRONGER ONLINE PRESENCE.

02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:45.458 region:rollup2
COURSE THAT IS A FAIR QUESTION.

02:07:43.756 --> 02:07:47.293 region:rollup2
IT'S A QUESTION BEING RAISED

02:07:45.458 --> 02:07:49.462 region:rollup2
WITHIN OUR OUR SYSTEM.

02:07:47.293 --> 02:07:50.696 region:rollup2
A FIRST OF ALL LET ME.

02:07:49.462 --> 02:07:52.265 region:rollup2
TING YOU TO TRY TO BE CLEAR.

02:07:50.696 --> 02:07:54.066 region:rollup2
.

02:07:52.265 --> 02:07:55.601 region:rollup2
WE'RE PROPOSING ITS A COMPETENCY

02:07:54.066 --> 02:07:57.770 region:rollup2
BASED EDUCATION MODEL A

02:07:55.601 --> 02:07:59.605 region:rollup2
PERSONALIZED LEARNING PLATFORM.

02:07:57.770 --> 02:08:01.741 region:rollup2
WHICH IS DIFFERENT VERY

02:07:59.605 --> 02:08:03.376 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THAN OUR TRADITIONAL.

02:08:01.741 --> 02:08:05.044 region:rollup2
SEEK TIME FOR CREDIT.

02:08:03.376 --> 02:08:07.013 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING

02:08:05.044 --> 02:08:08.814 region:rollup2
WHETHER ONLINE OR IN THE BRICK

02:08:07.013 --> 02:08:10.116 region:rollup2
AND MORTAR CLASSROOM.

02:08:08.814 --> 02:08:12.952 region:rollup2
SO ONE.

02:08:10.116 --> 02:08:14.086 region:rollup2
.

02:08:12.952 --> 02:08:16.522 region:rollup2
REALLY CREATING A VERY.

02:08:14.086 --> 02:08:18.424 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY NEW DELIVERY MODEL

02:08:16.522 --> 02:08:20.993 region:rollup2
IT'S PART OF WHY WE FEEL A NEW

02:08:18.424 --> 02:08:22.061 region:rollup2
ONLINE. ORGANIZATION COLLEGE

02:08:20.993 --> 02:08:23.963 region:rollup2
WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL IT IS

02:08:22.061 --> 02:08:27.099 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE.

02:08:23.963 --> 02:08:29.402 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO.

02:08:27.099 --> 02:08:29.936 region:rollup2
A UP AND THE ACADEMIC CALENDAR

02:08:29.402 --> 02:08:30.803 region:rollup2
FOR ONE OF OUR TRADITIONAL

02:08:29.936 --> 02:08:33.206 region:rollup2
COLLEGES.

02:08:30.803 --> 02:08:35.041 region:rollup2
AND THE SCALE AT WHICH WE'RE

02:08:33.206 --> 02:08:36.509 region:rollup2
TRYING TO ACHIEVE IN THE URGENCY

02:08:35.041 --> 02:08:37.443 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO.

02:08:36.509 --> 02:08:39.145 region:rollup2
TO ME.

02:08:37.443 --> 02:08:41.113 region:rollup2
.

02:08:39.145 --> 02:08:43.716 region:rollup2
BUT WE FEEL.

02:08:41.113 --> 02:08:46.652 region:rollup2
WOULD BE EASIER TO ACCOMPLISH IF

02:08:43.716 --> 02:08:48.788 region:rollup2
WE DEDICATED A GROUP OF FACULTY.

02:08:46.652 --> 02:08:50.957 region:rollup2
SOLE PURPOSE WAS TO DEVELOP THE

02:08:48.788 --> 02:08:52.358 region:rollup2
CONTENT FOR THIS PLATFORM AND TO

02:08:50.957 --> 02:08:54.093 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON THE NEEDS OF ADULTS OR.

02:08:52.358 --> 02:08:56.095 region:rollup2
.

02:08:54.093 --> 02:08:56.996 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY THERE ARE COLLEGES AND

02:08:56.095 --> 02:08:59.632 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE.

02:08:56.996 --> 02:09:00.1000 region:rollup2
IN IN THE SENATE HEARING ABOUT

02:08:59.632 --> 02:09:02.101 region:rollup2
SAN ANTONIO COLLEGE PRESIDENT

02:09:00.1000 --> 02:09:03.569 region:rollup2
BILL SCRUGGS DID A GREAT JOB OF

02:09:02.101 --> 02:09:05.338 region:rollup2
EX.

02:09:03.569 --> 02:09:07.006 region:rollup2
EXPLAINING HOW HE HAS

02:09:05.338 --> 02:09:07.607 region:rollup2
IT'S COLLEGE OF THE PROGRAM.

02:09:07.006 --> 02:09:09.308 region:rollup2
THAT DEALS WITH SOME OF THESE

02:09:07.607 --> 02:09:11.677 region:rollup2
NEEDS.

02:09:09.308 --> 02:09:14.547 region:rollup2
BUT THE NEEDS THAT.

02:09:11.677 --> 02:09:16.282 region:rollup2
HE IS SERVING ARE RELATIVELY

02:09:14.547 --> 02:09:18.517 region:rollup2
SMALL AND CONFINED TO HIS

02:09:16.282 --> 02:09:20.186 region:rollup2
DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.

02:09:18.517 --> 02:09:23.356 region:rollup2
SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO

02:09:20.186 --> 02:09:25.858 region:rollup2
SATISFY THOSE NEEDS AT SCALE. IF

02:09:23.356 --> 02:09:26.759 region:rollup2
WE GO COLLEGE BY COLLEGE WITHIN

02:09:25.858 --> 02:09:28.527 region:rollup2
REACH IN BECAUSE AT THE END OF

02:09:26.759 --> 02:09:29.729 region:rollup2
THE DAY. THAT COLLEGE HAS TO

02:09:28.527 --> 02:09:31.330 region:rollup2
PRODUCE ITS ENROLLMENT FOR ITS

02:09:29.729 --> 02:09:32.898 region:rollup2
OWN BUDGET.

02:09:31.330 --> 02:09:33.866 region:rollup2
AND SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

02:09:32.898 --> 02:09:35.468 region:rollup2
IS ELIMINATE SOME OF THAT

02:09:33.866 --> 02:09:36.369 region:rollup2
COMPETITION.

02:09:35.468 --> 02:09:38.137 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO.

02:09:36.369 --> 02:09:39.905 region:rollup2
AGAIN.

02:09:38.137 --> 02:09:41.941 region:rollup2
.

02:09:39.905 --> 02:09:44.977 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT.

02:09:41.941 --> 02:09:46.879 region:rollup2
TWO ASK A COLLEGE.

02:09:44.977 --> 02:09:48.714 region:rollup2
QUICKLY ADOPT AND ADAPT A BRAND

02:09:46.879 --> 02:09:50.750 region:rollup2
NEW.

02:09:48.714 --> 02:09:52.618 region:rollup2
SCHEDULING MODEL OF BRAND NEW

02:09:50.750 --> 02:09:55.388 region:rollup2
ACADEMIC CALENDAR A BRAND NEW

02:09:52.618 --> 02:09:55.955 region:rollup2
WAY OF DELIVERING CONTENT.

02:09:55.388 --> 02:09:57.390 region:rollup2
A IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF

02:09:55.955 --> 02:09:59.425 region:rollup2
TIME.

02:09:57.390 --> 02:10:00.593 region:rollup2
WHAT WE HOPE IS THAT THIS ONLINE

02:09:59.425 --> 02:10:01.761 region:rollup2
COLLEGE WILL PROVIDE THAT

02:10:00.593 --> 02:10:03.929 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THAT LEARNING

02:10:01.761 --> 02:10:05.264 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT THAT EXPERIMENTATION

02:10:03.929 --> 02:10:06.065 region:rollup2
THAT WILL THEN ALLOW ALL HUNDRED

02:10:05.264 --> 02:10:07.800 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN COLLEGES TO MORE

02:10:06.065 --> 02:10:09.702 region:rollup2
QUICKLY ADAPT?

02:10:07.800 --> 02:10:11.470 region:rollup2
MODELS THAT MIRROR.

02:10:09.702 --> 02:10:12.738 region:rollup2
WHAT'S BEING OFFERED AND ALLOW

02:10:11.470 --> 02:10:14.240 region:rollup2
THEM TO BUILD THEIR OWN CAPACITY

02:10:12.738 --> 02:10:15.107 region:rollup2
SO.

02:10:14.240 --> 02:10:16.676 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY.

02:10:15.107 --> 02:10:18.244 region:rollup2
WE FEEL THAT ADDING ONE MORE

02:10:16.676 --> 02:10:19.478 region:rollup2
MISSION.

02:10:18.244 --> 02:10:21.914 region:rollup2
TO THE COLLEGES.

02:10:19.478 --> 02:10:23.949 region:rollup2

02:10:21.914 --> 02:10:26.085 region:rollup2
THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY REACH.

02:10:23.949 --> 02:10:28.120 region:rollup2

WE FEEL IS NECESSARY IN THE

02:10:29.455 --> 02:10:34.226 region:rollup2
SCALE THAT WE THINK WE NEED.

HE'S ONLINE FLEXIBLE SHORT TERM

02:13:02.708 --> 02:13:03.976 region:rollup2
FORMAT THAT INTEGRATES WORK

BASED LEARNING.

02:13:03.976 --> 02:13:06.979 region:rollup2
THESE IN THE OTHER PROPOSED

02:13:05.177 --> 02:13:08.681 region:rollup2
DESIGN AND DELIVERY ELEMENTS OF

THE ONLINE COLLEGE ARE CRITICAL

02:13:08.681 --> 02:13:11.750 region:rollup2

YET A RC AS WELL AS THE OTHER

02:13:13.619 --> 02:13:16.789 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THIRTEEN COLLEGES. HAVE

02:13:15.154 --> 02:13:19.458 region:rollup2
BEEN UNABLE TO IMPLEMENT THESE

02:13:16.789 --> 02:13:20.826 region:rollup2
AT SCALE TO DO EXISTING BARRIERS

CONSTRAINTS.

02:13:23.195 --> 02:13:26.498 region:rollup2
SO THE STATUTORY BASIS FOR THE

02:13:24.797 --> 02:13:28.200 region:rollup2
ONLINE COLLEGE REMOVES MANY

02:13:26.498 --> 02:13:29.635 region:rollup2

ASSOCIATE DEGREE CREDENTIALS

02:13:57.630 --> 02:14:00.165 region:rollup2
WILL NOT DUPLICATE EFFORTS OF

IN FACT MAY COMPLEMENT THEM. AND

02:14:03.369 --> 02:14:05.971 region:rollup2
IT WILL NOT COMPETE WITH OUR

02:14:23.088 --> 02:14:26.158 region:rollup2
IN THE WORLD LET'S THAT WAIT FOR

02:14:24.490 --> 02:14:28.861 region:rollup2

SO IN REGARDS TO THE ONLINE

02:14:31.196 --> 02:14:33.532 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL.

02:14:31.463 --> 02:14:35.234 region:rollup2
.

02:14:33.532 --> 02:14:38.037 region:rollup2
OUR CLIENTS AGREE WITH THE

02:14:35.234 --> 02:14:40.706 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR AND THE CHANCELLOR THAT

02:14:38.037 --> 02:14:42.775 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO STEP UP ON COPS HE

02:14:40.706 --> 02:14:43.909 region:rollup2
BASED EDUCATION AND TRY TO

02:14:42.775 --> 02:14:45.811 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO BETTER

02:14:43.909 --> 02:14:46.812 region:rollup2
APPROACH. THOSE KIND OF STUDENTS

02:14:45.811 --> 02:14:49.181 region:rollup2
IN EDUCATION.

02:14:46.812 --> 02:14:51.650 region:rollup2
THE BARRIERS IN PLACE ARE BOTH

02:14:49.181 --> 02:14:52.151 region:rollup2
FUNDING AND STATUTORY.

02:14:51.650 --> 02:14:54.954 region:rollup2
IF WE CAN FOR EXAMPLE IN

02:14:52.151 --> 02:14:57.122 region:rollup2
FUNDING.

02:14:54.954 --> 02:14:59.124 region:rollup2
SO PUT SOME TARGETED FUNDING FOR

02:14:57.122 --> 02:15:00.993 region:rollup2
COMP SEE BASIS BEING SUGGESTED

02:14:59.124 --> 02:15:02.962 region:rollup2
IN THIS PROPOSED BUDGET. CHANGE

02:15:00.993 --> 02:15:05.264 region:rollup2
SOME REGULATIONS PRESIDENT GREEN

02:15:02.962 --> 02:15:06.765 region:rollup2
JUST TALKED ABOUT THEN I THINK

02:15:05.264 --> 02:15:08.167 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE COMMITTEE COLLEGES.

02:15:06.765 --> 02:15:09.568 region:rollup2
EITHER DIRECTLY IN THE COMMITTEE

02:15:08.167 --> 02:15:11.303 region:rollup2
COLLEGES STEP UP AND DO THIS

02:15:09.568 --> 02:15:12.905 region:rollup2
MORE. OR THROUGH THE ONLINE

02:15:11.303 --> 02:15:13.505 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE AND IF YOU CHOOSE TO

02:15:12.905 --> 02:15:15.741 region:rollup2
DO THE.

02:15:13.505 --> 02:15:16.308 region:rollup2
UNDER FIFTEEN COLLEGE SO

02:15:15.741 --> 02:15:16.976 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO

02:15:16.308 --> 02:15:19.545 region:rollup2
THIS.

02:15:16.976 --> 02:15:21.614 region:rollup2
MIGHT CLIENTS ARE READY TO STEP

02:15:19.545 --> 02:15:22.781 region:rollup2
UP AND GROW IN THIS AREA ONE

02:15:21.614 --> 02:15:25.417 region:rollup2
CHANGE ON THIS THAT WOULD BE

02:15:22.781 --> 02:15:27.820 region:rollup2
DRAMATIC IS HOW WE FUND ONLINE

02:15:25.417 --> 02:15:29.989 region:rollup2
EDUCATION. SO WE KNOW THAT THERE

02:15:27.820 --> 02:15:30.623 region:rollup2
IS A SIXTEEN PERCENT DROP IN

02:15:29.989 --> 02:15:33.792 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE COLLEGES WHEN YOU GO

02:15:30.623 --> 02:15:35.160 region:rollup2
ONLINE IF YOU HYBRID. THAT AND

02:15:33.792 --> 02:15:36.729 region:rollup2
YOU HAD DIRECT TUTORS YOUR

02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:38.831 region:rollup2
RESULTS GO UP.

02:15:36.729 --> 02:15:40.899 region:rollup2
SO WHAT THE WAY WE FIND ONLINE

02:15:38.831 --> 02:15:42.601 region:rollup2
IS ON UP OF PEOPLE COUNT THAT'S

02:15:40.899 --> 02:15:43.869 region:rollup2
ABOUT AN EIGHT PERCENT DROP. IF

02:15:42.601 --> 02:15:45.838 region:rollup2
WE COULD CHANGE THAT TO A CENSUS

02:15:43.869 --> 02:15:47.206 region:rollup2
DATE WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO BE

02:15:45.838 --> 02:15:48.641 region:rollup2
ABLE THEY ADD THOSE TUTORS AND

02:15:47.206 --> 02:15:51.043 region:rollup2
HYBRID EDUCATION.

02:15:48.641 --> 02:15:53.212 region:rollup2
AND ONLINE EDUCATION.

02:15:51.043 --> 02:15:54.146 region:rollup2
SO IT'S A BIG ISSUE. AND THE

02:15:53.212 --> 02:15:55.114 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE COLLEGES ARE READY TO

02:15:54.146 --> 02:15:58.584 region:rollup2
STEP UP I WAS WITH THE I THINK

STUDENTS THAN I HAD EVEN THE

02:16:48.934 --> 02:16:51.370 region:rollup2
TWENTY FOUR TO THIRTY FIVE YEAR

02:16:50.202 --> 02:16:53.172 region:rollup2
OLDS. THEY HAVE THE OPTION TO DO

02:16:51.370 --> 02:16:54.940 region:rollup2
AN ONLINE CLASS BUT THEY CHOSE

02:16:53.172 --> 02:16:56.775 region:rollup2
TO BE IN CLASS MY CLASS WHICH

02:16:54.940 --> 02:16:58.711 region:rollup2

02:16:56.775 --> 02:16:59.878 region:rollup2
OF THE INSTRUCTION WAS ONLINE.

02:16:58.711 --> 02:17:01.313 region:rollup2
LOT OF IT WAS IN CLASS IN MY

CERTIFICATION CLASSES.

02:17:08.220 --> 02:17:10.823 region:rollup2
WAS THAT THE HIGH SCHOOL

STUDENTS THAT I HAD SEVERELY

02:17:10.823 --> 02:17:13.525 region:rollup2

02:17:16.562 --> 02:17:20.065 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATION TEST FOR MICROSOFT

02:17:18.030 --> 02:17:21.567 region:rollup2
OFFICE COULD BE PASSED.

02:17:20.065 --> 02:17:25.037 region:rollup2

OUR STUDENTS FROM EXPLOITATION.

02:18:09.214 --> 02:18:11.517 region:rollup2

CONTRACTING OUT WORK IN A

02:18:21.860 --> 02:18:24.229 region:rollup2
QUESTIONABLE EFFORT TO SAVE A

FEW BUCKS.

02:18:24.229 --> 02:18:27.032 region:rollup2
HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION IS NOT

02:18:25.063 --> 02:18:28.934 region:rollup2
CHEAP

02:18:27.032 --> 02:18:29.735 region:rollup2
A TAKING SOME ONLINE COURSES AS

02:18:28.934 --> 02:18:31.103 region:rollup2
PART OF A BRICK AND MORTAR

02:18:29.735 --> 02:18:32.404 region:rollup2
DEGREE PROGRAM IS ONE THING

02:18:31.103 --> 02:18:33.739 region:rollup2
ENTIRE ONLINE.

02:18:32.404 --> 02:18:35.541 region:rollup2
DEGREES IS ANOTHER.

02:18:33.739 --> 02:18:35.808 region:rollup2
AT THE END OF THE DAY WE BELIEVE

02:18:35.541 --> 02:18:36.909 region:rollup2
THAT THE.

02:18:35.808 --> 02:18:38.844 region:rollup2
A PROPOSED FUNDING WOULD BE

02:18:36.909 --> 02:18:40.679 region:rollup2
BETTER SPENT SUPPORTING ONLINE

02:18:38.844 --> 02:18:42.447 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL OFFERINGS IN THE

02:18:40.679 --> 02:18:43.682 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES TODAY WE

02:18:42.447 --> 02:18:44.616 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT IF THE GOVERNOR

02:18:43.682 --> 02:18:45.651 region:rollup2
REALLY WANTS TO MAKE A

02:18:44.616 --> 02:18:47.286 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE IN HIGHER EDUCATION

02:18:45.651 --> 02:18:48.787 region:rollup2
AND ACCESS ONE THING YOU COULD

02:18:47.286 --> 02:18:50.255 region:rollup2
DO IS FULLY FUND THE SEGMENTS.

02:18:48.787 --> 02:18:52.191 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE THAT EACH QUALIFIED

02:18:50.255 --> 02:18:52.825 region:rollup2
STUDENT HAS A SEAT AND IS NOT

02:18:52.191 --> 02:18:55.160 region:rollup2
TURNED AWAY DUE TO FUNDING THINK

02:18:52.825 --> 02:18:56.528 region:rollup2
YOU.

02:18:55.160 --> 02:18:57.563 region:rollup2
GOOD MORNING JENNIFER BAKER WITH

02:18:56.528 --> 02:18:58.797 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS

02:18:57.563 --> 02:19:00.532 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATION.

02:18:58.797 --> 02:19:02.034 region:rollup2
WE DO HAVE A NUMBER OF SERIOUS

02:19:00.532 --> 02:19:03.502 region:rollup2
CONCERNS BUT THAT THE MOST

02:19:02.034 --> 02:19:05.470 region:rollup2
PROMINENT CONCERN IS.

02:19:03.502 --> 02:19:06.905 region:rollup2
THE LACK OF CONSTITUTIONALITY

02:19:05.470 --> 02:19:08.507 region:rollup2
IN THE SET UP OF THE STRUCTURE

02:19:06.905 --> 02:19:10.409 region:rollup2
OF THE BOARD WE BELIEVE IT'S AN

02:19:08.507 --> 02:19:12.010 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL CONFLICT. TO THE

02:19:10.409 --> 02:19:13.645 region:rollup2
TENETS OF PROP NINETY EIGHT IT

02:19:12.010 --> 02:19:15.781 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT BE SUSTAINABLE.

02:19:13.645 --> 02:19:17.282 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY BECAUSE ONCE THAT

02:19:15.781 --> 02:19:19.051 region:rollup2
THE COLLEGES ESTABLISH IT'S RUN

02:19:17.282 --> 02:19:20.819 region:rollup2
BY A PRIVATE BOARD GRANTED THIS

02:19:19.051 --> 02:19:22.154 region:rollup2
IS THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS BUT IN

02:19:20.819 --> 02:19:23.622 region:rollup2
CONTEXT OF PROP NINETY EIGHT

02:19:22.154 --> 02:19:25.691 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT A LOCAL ELECT

02:19:23.622 --> 02:19:27.626 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL AGENCY WHICH MEANS

02:19:25.691 --> 02:19:29.228 region:rollup2
PROP NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS CANNOT

02:19:27.626 --> 02:19:30.963 region:rollup2
FLOW IN BE MANAGED. THROUGH THAT

02:19:29.228 --> 02:19:32.798 region:rollup2
INSTITUTION AND THEREFORE IT'S

02:19:30.963 --> 02:19:34.833 region:rollup2
AN CONSTITUTIONAL CONFLICT IN

02:19:32.798 --> 02:19:36.735 region:rollup2
CANNOT BE RECTIFIED IN LESS THIS

02:19:34.833 --> 02:19:38.437 region:rollup2
WERE TO ACTUALLY RUN THROUGH A

02:19:36.735 --> 02:19:41.240 region:rollup2
LOCAL COMMUNICABLE AGE THAT'S

02:19:38.437 --> 02:19:43.408 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY ACCOUNTABLE TO VOTERS.

ABILITY TO SET FEES THAT WOULD

02:20:35.527 --> 02:20:38.163 region:rollup2

DAY IN THE LONG RUN THAT THE FEE

02:20:44.102 --> 02:20:46.872 region:rollup2

DO THIS TO GO TO MISLEAD MOUNDS

02:22:31.176 --> 02:22:35.680 region:rollup2
QUESTION AS WELL. THE IDEA THAT

02:22:33.745 --> 02:22:36.948 region:rollup2
WE START A PROGRAM WE SAY THAT

02:22:35.680 --> 02:22:38.383 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT GONNA GROW WHEN LAST

02:22:36.948 --> 02:22:39.885 region:rollup2
WE MEET CERTAIN CONSIDERATIONS

02:22:38.383 --> 02:22:41.753 region:rollup2
AND YET WE SEE TIME AND TIME

02:22:39.885 --> 02:22:44.122 region:rollup2
AGAIN WHERE THE POLITICAL.

02:22:41.753 --> 02:22:45.457 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATIONS COME AND THEY

02:22:44.122 --> 02:22:46.892 region:rollup2
OVERWHELM THAT

02:22:45.457 --> 02:22:48.059 region:rollup2
AND THE PROGRAM GOES AND SO THE

02:22:46.892 --> 02:22:49.494 region:rollup2
IDEA THAT WE'RE THINKING NOW

02:22:48.059 --> 02:22:50.695 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO COMPETE

02:22:49.494 --> 02:22:52.264 region:rollup2
IN THE FUNDING STRUCTURE BUT

02:22:50.695 --> 02:22:54.332 region:rollup2
THEIR EXISTING COLLEGES. CHANGES

02:22:52.264 --> 02:22:55.801 region:rollup2
OVER TIME BECAUSE THERE ARE

02:22:54.332 --> 02:22:57.536 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENCIES THAT SAY THAT WE

02:22:55.801 --> 02:22:59.337 region:rollup2
CAN BENEFIT FROM EXPANSION NOT

02:22:57.536 --> 02:23:01.073 region:rollup2
WITHSTANDING WHATEVER ANALYSIS

02:22:59.337 --> 02:23:02.874 region:rollup2

02:26:05.890 --> 02:26:09.394 region:rollup2
EXCITING THING TO REALLY LOOK

02:26:13.531 --> 02:26:17.302 region:rollup2
PUBLIC COMMUNITY COLLEGES OR AS

UTILIZED THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM

02:26:24.342 --> 02:26:28.380 region:rollup2
THAT'S A FANTASTIC. SO THERE'S

02:26:26.544 --> 02:26:29.347 region:rollup2
SUPPORT FOR THE IDEA OF

02:26:28.380 --> 02:26:31.583 region:rollup2
INNOVATIVE APPROACHES WE HAVE TO

02:26:29.347 --> 02:26:32.851 region:rollup2

02:26:33.818 --> 02:26:39.291 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

02:26:38.023 --> 02:26:41.192 region:rollup2
HELLO GOOD MORNING MY NAME'S

02:26:39.291 --> 02:26:41.626 region:rollup2
PAUL VOTES MORE EACH HISTORY I'M

02:26:41.192 --> 02:26:43.528 region:rollup2
HAS REPRESSOR IT.

02:26:41.626 --> 02:26:44.863 region:rollup2
THREE COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN THE

02:26:43.528 --> 02:26:46.731 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO AREA.

02:26:44.863 --> 02:26:49.467 region:rollup2
AND I'M HERE TO SAY THAT.

02:26:46.731 --> 02:26:50.802 region:rollup2
I DEFINITELY THINK THAT THIS

02:26:49.467 --> 02:26:53.104 region:rollup2
MONEY WOULD BE BETTER SPENT ON

02:26:50.802 --> 02:26:54.306 region:rollup2
EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE

02:26:53.104 --> 02:26:55.607 region:rollup2
IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND.

02:26:54.306 --> 02:26:57.075 region:rollup2
MOSTLY BECAUSE WHEN YOU TALK

02:26:55.607 --> 02:26:58.843 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS TWO POINT FIVE

02:26:57.075 --> 02:27:00.445 region:rollup2
MILLION STRANDED WORKERS.

02:26:58.843 --> 02:27:02.213 region:rollup2
ARE THERE ALSO MEMBERS OF

02:27:00.445 --> 02:27:03.682 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES SO THERE THERE'S THE

02:27:02.213 --> 02:27:05.116 region:rollup2
IDEA OF A STATEWIDE COMMUNITY

02:27:03.682 --> 02:27:06.785 region:rollup2
COLLEGE THAT THEY REPRESENT THAT

02:27:05.116 --> 02:27:07.619 region:rollup2
WOULD BE BETTER SERVED IF YOU

02:27:06.785 --> 02:27:09.387 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THEM AS MEMBERS OF.

02:27:07.619 --> 02:27:11.623 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY

02:27:09.387 --> 02:27:13.758 region:rollup2
THE I'VE TAUGHT ONLINE ONE

02:27:11.623 --> 02:27:15.427 region:rollup2
GROUND HYBRID CLASSES AND

02:27:13.758 --> 02:27:16.494 region:rollup2
WITHOUT A DOUBT THE MOST

02:27:15.427 --> 02:27:17.829 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL STUDENTS OF THE WANT

02:27:16.494 --> 02:27:19.230 region:rollup2
TO HAVE SOME SORT OF FACE TO

02:27:17.829 --> 02:27:20.732 region:rollup2
FACE ACCESS.

02:27:19.230 --> 02:27:22.233 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S A HYBRID CLASS OR

02:27:20.732 --> 02:27:23.835 region:rollup2
EVEN AN ONLINE CLASS

02:27:22.233 --> 02:27:25.670 region:rollup2
SO WHAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE DONE

02:27:23.835 --> 02:27:26.938 region:rollup2
IS ENCOURAGING MORE DEVELOPMENT

02:27:25.670 --> 02:27:29.307 region:rollup2

CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE

I THINK WE CAN DO IT BETTER AND

02:29:09.207 --> 02:29:12.010 region:rollup2
CHEAPER.

NUMBER OF DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS

03:14:07.469 --> 03:14:11.073 region:rollup2

ON TOP OF THE STAIRS AND PURRS

03:14:19.281 --> 03:14:22.784 region:rollup2

03:15:05.327 --> 03:15:07.963 region:rollup2
FUNDING CUT WOULD BE SO GREAT.

03:15:06.962 --> 03:15:17.506 region:rollup2
THAT WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO

03:15:07.963 --> 03:15:18.173 region:rollup2
AFFORD TO MAINTAIN THAT ACCESS

03:15:17.506 --> 03:15:18.807 region:rollup2
AND WHATEVER HAPPENED A LIFELONG

03:15:18.173 --> 03:15:19.441 region:rollup2
LEARNING. BUT THE MASTER PLAN

03:15:18.807 --> 03:15:20.075 region:rollup2
UNTIL THIS MODEL SEEMS LIKE IT

03:15:19.441 --> 03:15:20.742 region:rollup2
COMPLETE ABROGATION OF THE OLD

03:15:20.075 --> 03:15:21.443 region:rollup2
MASTER PLAN IN TERMS OF WHAT THE

03:15:20.742 --> 03:15:22.010 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES WERE DESIGNED

03:15:21.443 --> 03:15:22.611 region:rollup2
TO DO SO IT'S IT'S A WELL

03:15:22.010 --> 03:15:25.247 region:rollup2
ESPOSITO'S. ó WE DO SEE THE

03:15:22.611 --> 03:15:25.814 region:rollup2
MODEL IS AN ASSAULT ON OUR

03:15:25.247 --> 03:15:26.114 region:rollup2

SERVICES LIKE UPS OR SOME OF THE

03:15:35.524 --> 03:15:38.660 region:rollup2
VERY BEST THINGS WE DO THE

03:15:37.092 --> 03:15:40.362 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE TO SUGGEST

03:15:38.660 --> 03:15:41.430 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD ALLOCATE TWENTY FIVE

03:15:40.362 --> 03:15:43.432 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THE TOTAL FUNDING.

03:15:41.430 --> 03:15:45.400 region:rollup2
BASED ON OUTCOMES MEASURES THIS

03:15:43.432 --> 03:15:47.102 region:rollup2
IS A A REAL PROBLEM AND I HOPE

03:15:45.400 --> 03:15:48.403 region:rollup2
YOU WILL REJECT IT I'M READING

03:15:47.102 --> 03:15:49.972 region:rollup2
FROM A RECENT RESEARCH BOOK THE

03:15:48.403 --> 03:15:51.106 region:rollup2
EXTENT RESEARCH LITERATURE HAS

03:15:49.972 --> 03:15:52.507 region:rollup2
FOUND THE PERFORMANCE BASED

03:15:51.106 --> 03:15:54.042 region:rollup2
FUNDING HAS LITTLE IMPACT ON

03:15:52.507 --> 03:15:56.912 region:rollup2
STUDENT OUTCOMES.

03:15:54.042 --> 03:15:58.880 region:rollup2
BUT THERE ARE HUGE A SIZEABLE

03:15:56.912 --> 03:16:00.215 region:rollup2
UNINTENDED NEGATIVE IMPACTS

03:15:58.880 --> 03:16:01.817 region:rollup2
INCLUDING RESTRICTING

03:16:00.215 --> 03:16:03.318 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONAL COOPERATION

03:16:01.817 --> 03:16:05.520 region:rollup2
LIMITING OUR MISSION UNDERMINING

03:16:03.318 --> 03:16:07.022 region:rollup2
MORALE. UNDERMINING QUALITY

03:16:05.520 --> 03:16:08.457 region:rollup2
STANDARDS

03:16:07.022 --> 03:16:10.993 region:rollup2

ABOUT HERE AND.

03:16:10.993 --> 03:16:13.862 region:rollup2
OF EVERYTHING EVERYBODY HAS

03:16:12.561 --> 03:16:15.030 region:rollup2
LEARNED FROM PERFORMANCE SPACE

03:16:13.862 --> 03:16:16.732 region:rollup2
FUNDING THE KEY IS TO BUILD

03:16:15.030 --> 03:16:17.1000 region:rollup2
CAPACITY FOR INSTITUTIONAL

03:16:16.732 --> 03:16:19.534 region:rollup2
CHANGE WE NEED TO WORK ON

03:16:17.1000 --> 03:16:21.403 region:rollup2
CAPACITY BUILDING AND THE

03:16:19.534 --> 03:16:22.271 region:rollup2
BIGGEST WEAKNESS OF THE SYSTEM

03:16:21.403 --> 03:16:23.772 region:rollup2
IS OUR OVER RELIANCE ON PART

03:16:22.271 --> 03:16:25.073 region:rollup2
TIME FACULTY.

03:16:23.772 --> 03:16:27.609 region:rollup2

WHERE I COME UP HERE EVERY YEAR

03:16:30.445 --> 03:16:33.982 region:rollup2
AND MAKE THIS.

03:16:32.414 --> 03:16:35.617 region:rollup2
THESE INITIATIVES ARE NOT GOING

03:16:33.982 --> 03:16:36.151 region:rollup2
TO PRODUCE THE OUTCOMES WE WANT

03:16:35.617 --> 03:16:37.419 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE THE

03:16:36.151 --> 03:16:39.021 region:rollup2
CAPACITY.

03:16:37.419 --> 03:16:40.756 region:rollup2
TO MAKE THE CHANGES THAT WE'RE

03:16:39.021 --> 03:16:42.190 region:rollup2
TRYING TO INCENTIVIZE.

03:16:40.756 --> 03:16:44.393 region:rollup2
START BY IMPROVING YOUR FULL

03:17:19.795 --> 03:17:23.732 region:rollup2
CAN JAM INTO ANOTHER SIMILAR

03:17:22.030 --> 03:17:25.734 region:rollup2
