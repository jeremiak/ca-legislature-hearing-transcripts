RENDON SECRETARY PLEASE RATE SENATE BILL FIFTY SEVEN BY SENATOR WIENER AN ACT RELATING TO CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. WIENER I THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT BECAUSE TODAY I RISE TO PRESENT SENATE BILL FIFTY SEVEN. WHICH WILL HELP US TO ADDRESS THE ONGOING EPIDEMIC OF DRUG OVERDOSES IN CALIFORNIA BY ALLOWING BUT NOT REQUIRING- THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES AND THE CITY OF OAKLAND. TO HAVE THE DISCRETION TO AUTHORIZE OVERDOSE AS SAFE CONSUMPTION SITES. OVERDOSE PREVENTION PROGRAMS ARE PROGRAMS WHERE PEOPLE MAY USE THEIR OWN CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF STAFF TRAINED TO PREVENT AND TO TREAT OVERDOSE IS. TO PREVENT HIV AND HEPATITIS INFECTION AND TO FACILITATE ENTRY INTO SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT AND OTHER SERVICES. OVERDOSE PREVENTION PROGRAMS ARE NECESSARY INTERVENTION TO PREVENT OVERDOSE DEATHS. ASSEMBLY ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY OF THESE PROGRAMS EXISTED IN TEN COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD AND THEY HAVE BEEN RIGOROUSLY RESEARCHED AND SHOWN TO REDUCE HEALTH AND SAFETY PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH DRUG USE INCLUDING A REDUCTION IN PUBLIC DRUG USE. BY MOVING PEOPLE INSIDE TO A CLEAN AND SAFE AND HEALTHY SPACE FOR THE PEOPLE INSTEAD OF INJECTING OR USING ON SIDEWALKS OR IN PARKS OR IN FRONT OF PEOPLE'S HOMES OR BUSINESSES CAN USE INSIDE. BY REDUCING SYRINGE LITTER. BY REDUCING HIV AND HEPATITIS INFECTIONS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY BY REDUCING OVERDOSE DEATHS. IN THE MANY YEARS THAT THESE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN IN EXISTENCE AROUND THE WORLD A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY OF THEM THERE HAS NEVER NOT ONCE IN A RECORDED OVERDOSE DEATHS IN ANY OF THESE FACILITIES NOT A SINGLE OVERDOSE STAFF. THESE PROGRAMS RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN ER VISITS AND PARAMEDIC CALLS. WHICH WE KNOW NOW DURING COALBED THAT'S A GOOD THING TO REDUCE STRESS ON OUR HOSPITALS. THEY DON'T INCREASE CRIME. AND THEY DO INCREASE ENTRY INTO RECOVERY PROGRAMS. AND THAT IS WHY ORGANIZATIONS IN CALIFORNIA THAT ACTUALLY ENGAGE IN ADDICTION TREATMENT TO GET PEOPLE HEALTHY ARE SUPPORTING THIS BILL. KHALIS CALIFORNIA OUR NATION ARE IN THE MIDST OF AN UNPRECEDENTED EXPLOSION OF OVERDOSE DEATHS IT'S A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS ALMOST FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES DIED OF OVERDOSE DEATHS LAST YEAR. WE'RE SEEING RECORDS IN SAN FRANCISCO IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AROUND THE STATE WHAT WE'RE DOING IS NOT WORKING AND WE NEED TO TRY A PROVEN TOOL THAT HAS WORKED AROUND THE WORLD. THIS BILL SPONSORED BY DRUG TREATMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE- THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG PROGRAM EXECUTIVES AND IS SUPPORTED BY NUMEROUS ORGANIZATIONS SPECIALIZING IN SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT. SB FIFTY SEVEN PROVIDES CALIFORNIA THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD BY EXAMPLE. AND TO HELP ADDRESS THIS TERRIBLE EPIDEMIC OF OVERDOSE DEATHS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS.

MR PRESIDENT AND ARE RIGHT SOME OF THE ARAKAN. OF A MEMBER ROB BONTA FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL OUR DISTRICTS OVERLAP AND WE HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE AND GOOD FORTUNE TO WORK TOGETHER NOW FOR SINCE THE POINT THAT HE WAS ELECTED TO THE ASSEMBLY AND- TWENTY. TO TURN NOW I'M GONNA FORGET TWENTY JENNER TWENTY TWELVE ANYWAY- TWENTY TWELVE- AND WE WERE FACING A- REALLY CRITICAL. I WOULDN'T SAY NO EXACT GREAT THIS MOMENT IN THE LONG COUPLE OF YEARS A VERY STRONG EXAMINER. OUR JUSTICE. AND WHAT IT REALLY TRULY JUST. AND THEN WHAT IT'S IN HAVE BEEN. ONE OR LOW INCOME. AND A SPECIAL OUR CAN OF. DAN THIS ARE WHAT JUST. HAS PASSED NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT REFORM. THAT THE AG THE TO OF JUSTICE THE AG'S OFFICE WILL HAVE RESPONSIBILITY TO IMPLEMENT. AND WE HAVE ALSO PASSED A NUMBER OF REFORMS THAT. WE PUT A FOCUS TRUE TO. UNDERSTAND AND- JUST THROUGH THE LENS OF RACIAL EQUITY. AND WHILE THERE COULD BE MANY POSSIBLE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S WHO WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE ON THAT MANTLE AND HELP US IN REALLY RE LOOKING AT OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM THROUGH THAT LENS I THINK THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA IS UNIQUELY QUALIFIED FOR THAT ANDI ALSO THINK THAT WE BENEFIT FROM THE FACT THAT HE WAS THE MOST SERVED IN THE LAST A- PERIOD OF TIME OVER A DECADE IN THE LEGISLATURE SO HE HAS BEEN A PARTNER WITH US. IN REALLY TACKLING AND TAKE ON TRYING UNDER. BETTER THOSE ISSUES AND ADDITIONALLY THE ISSUES OF. POLICE VIOLENCE. AND THERE IS A VERY. BILL THAT THE DOJ IS NOW RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT IS GOING TO SET UP AN INDEPENDENT INDEPENDENT MEANING THROUGH THE DOJ OFFICE SO. ABILITY TO INVESTIGATE THE SHOOTINGS THAT RESULT IN THE DEATH OF AN UNARMED CIVILIANS AND WE HAVE NOT HAD THAT IN CALIFORNIA SO THERE ARE SOME VERY UNIQUE- RESPONSIBILITIES THAT WE EXPECT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE NOW TO TAKE ON BANDS I THINK AGAIN THAT WE HAVE A PERSON AS UNIQUELY SUITED FOR THAT AND IT HAS. WITH BASS OVER THE LAST DAY REALLY SHOULD REALLY GRAPPLED WITH THOSE ISSUES AND I WHAT ALL OF US AND I MEAN THE ENTIRE STATE CALIFORNIA.

CALIFORNIA HAS ESTABLISHED A PROCESS ALONG WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WE DO IT THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING. WHERE OUR GOVERNMENT HAS MADE A DETERMINATION THAT WILL INTERVENE ON THE BEHALF OF VICTIMS OF DISCRIMINATION. WE HAVE BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE IN THAT REGARD FOR MANY YEARS AS THIS AGENCY HAS PROTECTED THE RIGHTS AND ITS POLICE POWER ON BEHALF OF OUR CITIZENS. FOR THESE ABUSES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES THE SAME THING WITH THE EEOC. ONE OF THE GREAT CHALLENGES WE FACE IS THAT WE STAND IN THE POSITION WHERE THE INDIVIDUALS THE REAL PARTY IN INTEREST BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A CONFIDENTIAL RELATIONSHIP. WITH THAT INDIVIDUAL TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE FULLY PROTECTED COOPERATE AS WE PROTECT THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS. THE OTHER DAY. I HAVE THE CASE RIGHT HERE MISTER. PRESIDENT ON. MARCH THIRTEENTH THE COURT OF APPEALS IN THE FOURTH APPELLATE DISTRICT RULED IN THE WOODS CASE WOULD CASE CONTRA A MAJOR DECISION CONTRARY TO HOW WE DO BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SAYING THAT THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION THIS CASE EMAILS IS NOT PROTECTED BETWEEN THE AGENCY AND THE INDIVIDUAL. THE COURT MADE A BAD DECISION THEY WERE WRONG. WHAT THE COURT DID AND I WANT TO READ MISTER. PRESIDENT IN THE IN THE DECISION. THEY BASICALLY SAID THAT OUR DEFERENCE TO THE LEGISLATURE'S PARTICULARLY NECESSARY WHEN WE'RE CALLED ON TO INTERPRET THE CRITIQUE PRIVATE PROVISION. BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE HAS DETERMINED THAT EVIDENTIARY PRIVILEGE TO BE AVAILABLE ONLY AS DEFINED BY STATUTE. SO WERE CAUGHT IN THIS VORTEX OF HOW THE LAWS TO BE INTERPRETED HAND SO THE COURT BASICALLY INVITED US. TO STAND AND TO FURTHER DEFINE RETURNING CLIENT PRIVILEGES SO WE MAKE SURE THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL COULD SHARE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND THE GOVERNMENT HOLDS AT PRIVILEGE.
