THIS IS PROFESSIONS A MEETING A COUPLE OF HOUSEKEEPING ITEMS ONE IS THAT SO WELCOME ASSEMBLY WOMAN QUIRK SILVA. WHO IS SERBIAN TODAY WELCOME GOOD TO SEE YOU AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE ONE BILL ON CONSENT -- WE WILL NOTICE AN ABSENCE OF A QUORUM SO A WILL BE OPERATING AS A SUB COMMITTEE NOW AND WILL FIRST THEN GET TO ITEM NUMBER ONE WHICH IS AB. TWO TWO EIGHT BY ASSEMBLY WOMAN AGUIAR-CURRY SO SOMEONE. VERY IF YOU WISH TO PRESENT OR IF YOU'RE STILL WAITING FOR ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WE CAN PERHAPS GOING. TO KNOW YOU'RE GOOD. GOOD AGAIN THIS IS AB. TWO TWO EIGHT PLEASE FEEL FREE TO PRESENT WHEN YOU WERE READY. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB TWO TO A CLARIFIES THAT A FOOD BEVERAGE OR CAUSE MEDIC THE CONTAINS THE CBD DERIVED FROM INDUSTRIAL HIM CANNOT BE PER. PROHIBITED BASED SOLELY ON THE FACT THAT IT CONTAINS HIM DERIVE CB DEEP. ALL FOOD SAFETY LAWS IN RETAIL FOOD STANDARDS WOULD STILL APPLY SLIMMY JUST MAKE THAT CLEAR. ALL FOOD SAFETY LAWS IN RETAIL FOOD STANDARDS WOULD STILL APPLY. LET ME CLARIFY WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HIM IS NOT MARIJUANA. THE CVT CAN BE EXTRACTED FROM BOTH WHEN IT IS PRODUCED FROM HIM THERE ARE NO CYCLE ACTIVE AFFECTS. THIS IS BECAUSE BY DEFINITION INDUSTRIAL HEMP CONTAINS ONLY THREE TENTHS OF A PERCENT THC OR LESS. THC IS A PSYCHOACTIVE COMPONENT IN MARIJUANA PRODUCTS. AS A STATE WE ALREADY LEGALIZE CANNABIS WOULD NOT WITHSTANDING A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S ONGOING STANCE THAT CANNABIS IS ILLEGAL. WHEN IT COMES TO THE NON INTOXICATING ALTERNATIVE WE ARE LAGGING BEHIND? THE MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF HIM CBD IS RAPIDLY EXPANDING WITH OVER A THOUSAND EMPLOYEES AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF ECONOMIC PRODUCTIVITY IN CALIFORNIA. MANY CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS CURRENTLY PURCHASE HIM SEE BEAUTY PRODUCTS THAT COFFEE SHOPS GYMS AND WELLNESS STORES WITHOUT KNOWING THAT IS TECHNICALLY WAS NOT LEGAL. SHOULD THE STATE CHOOSE NOT TO CLARIFY THE HIM SEE BEAUTY PRODUCTS ARE DEAL FOR SALE CONCEPTION THESE JOBS IN THIS BUSINESS WOULD BE LOST. LAST WEEK IN THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE I ADDED URGENCY CLOSE TO THIS BILL DUE TO THE CRITICAL NEED TO CLARIFY THE STATE'S ROLE IN ENFORCEMENT OF HIM CVD. WE CANNOT LEAVE OUR CITIZENS FARMERS AND BUSINESSES WITH UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHETHER HIM DRIVE CVD MAY CONTINUE TO BE SOLD AND PURCHASED IN CALIFORNIA. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB. TWO TWO EIGHT OF TWO WOULD NOT HAVE A COUPLE WITNESSES HERE. ON BEHALF OF THE HIP AND CANNABIS INDUSTRY. GREAT THANK YOU UP TO TWO MINUTES IN TOTAL PLEASE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CARE MEMBERS JIM GROSS WITH NIELSEN WORKS MARIN BEHALF OF THE U. S. HEMP ROUND TABLE. THE US HEMP ROUNDTABLE REPRESENTS -- ALL LEVELS OF SUPPLY CHAIN -- OUT FOR HIM -- AS MISS AGUIAR-CURRY SAD THIS BILL IS CLARIFYING EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW WITH RESPECT TO THE LEGALITY OF THE C. B. D. DERIVED FROM HIM WE DO FIND OURSELVES IN A UNIQUE SITUATION. GIVEN THAT -- CALIFORNIA DID LEGALIZE CANNABIS UNDER PROP SIXTY FOUR WHICH INCLUDED CD DRIVE FROM CANNABIS -- THE GOAL HERE IS -- TO LAMINATE THE CLOUD THAT HANGS OVER THESE MANUFACTURERS DISTRIBUTORS RETAILERS ALL OF WHOM -- HAVE BECOME VERY INVESTED IN THIS BUSINESS AS HAVE -- THE CONSUMERS OF CALIFORNIA AS YOU KNOW THEY CAN OBTAIN IT OVER THE INTERNET -- BUT WE HAVE A GROWING -- CALIFORNIA BASED BUSINESS THAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE.

ON THE ISSUE OF TESTING OF HIM THANK YOU. MORE MATURE MEMBERS MY NAME IS ROBERT WITH CALIFORNIA HIM COUNCIL VOTE HIM IN A HIGH ENERGETICS AND JUST TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION THAT HE POSED REGARDING TESTING CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN IN THE FOREFRONT OF MAKING WAY FOR HIM GROWTH. OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND TO STAY AHEAD OF AN INDUSTRY THAT IS CURRENTLY EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS AND DUE TO GROW BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO ONE POINT. NINE MILLION DOLLARS SO IN REGARDS TO TESTING ITSELF EIGHT TWO IN ORDER TO GROW HAMPER READ. A GROWER MUST REGISTER WITH THE COUNTY AG COMMISSIONER THEY MUST HAVE GPS COORDINATES ON WHERE THAT CROPS TO BE GROWN AND SPECIFICALLY WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO GROW. A IN BEFORE THEY THEY ARE ABLE TO HARVEST THAT CROP HAS TO BE TESTED THEY HAVE TESTERS THE COME OUT AND TEST THE CROP FOR CERTAIN CONDITIONS IS SPECIFICALLY THC. TO MAKE SURE IT'S NOT MORE THAN POINT 3% THC IF THAT CROP FAILS THAT TEST THE CROP HAS THERE ARE PROVISIONS IN STATE LAW THAT CROP MUST BE DESTROYED IN THE PROPER MANNER. AND WITHIN A CERTAIN TIME FRAME THANK YOU. CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION WE HAVE FIVE HUNDRED MEMBERS FIFTEEN THOUSAND EMPLOYEES -- WE ARE STANDING UNITED WITH THE HEMP INDUSTRY -- THIS IS A GROWING EMERGING MARKET A LOT OF OUR OPERATORS ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OF OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT THIS MAY BRING VERTICALLY AS WERE STRUGGLING.

OF CVD PRODUCTS I USED THEIR IS TESTING WHEN IT COMES TO THE CD LEVELS IN THE THC LEVELS. HOWEVER AND CBT IS CONSUMED IN APPLIED IN THE EXACT SAME FASHION AS THC PRODUCTS ARE THERE APPLIED TOPICALLY CONSUMED ORALLY OR THEIR INHALED OR SMOKED -- CAN SIMPLE NEARLY. AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT THERE AT THE SAME RISK -- OF TOXICITY WHEN IT COMES TO THE LEVELS OF CONTAMINATION AND SO THEY SHOULD UNDERGO THE SAME LEVEL OF US SCREENING AT THE THC PRODUCTION.

ON HOW TO INTEGRATE FOREIGN TRAINED PROFESSIONALS AND HOW TO ELIMINATE UNNECESSARY BARRIERS FOR FOREIGN PROFESSIONALS I WANT TO START BY THINKING THE CHAIR AND HIS STAFF FOR WORKING SO DILIGENTLY WITH ME ON THIS BILL. THIS BILL IS THE REINTRODUCTION OF AB EIGHT TWENTY SEVEN FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN CURRENT LAW PROVIDES FOR THE LICENSOR LICENSING. AND REGULATION OF VARIOUS PROFESSIONALS AND VOCATIONAL LOCATIONS BY BOARDS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS. HOWEVER SOME IMMIGRANTS HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT THE PROCESS HAVING MULTIPLE BARRIERS. IN TERMS OF PROCESS TIME IN TIME. IN S. OF DEGREE -- EVALUATION AND ACCEPTANCE OF FOREIGN CREDENTIALS MY A BILL AB FOR SEVENTY SIX CREATES A STARTING POINT JUST A STARTING POINT. FOR REMEDYING THIS ISSUES BY TAKING REASONABLE STEPS TO IDENTIFY A SOLUTION TO THESE BARRIERS -- THREE TASK FORCE HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT I HAVE JUST A BIT VIELE FROM CHIRLA THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL. THANK YOU A GOOD MORNING -- AGAIN MY NAME IS JOSEPH JULY DIRECTOR OF POLICY NOW BECAUSE HE WE CHIRLA POLLUTION FOR HUMANE IMMIGRANT RIGHTS WE APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY WOMAN FRONT TO THE SING A. B.. FOUR SEVENTY SIX CALIFORNIAS HOME -- APPROXIMATELY TEN MILLION IMMIGRANTS IN A CURRENT TO THE PUBLIC INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA SINCE. 201659% OF THE NEWLY ARRIVED IMMIGRANTS WERE FROM ASIA I'M IN THE MAJORITY OF THEM HAVE AT SOME SERVE ADVANCED DEGREE. FURTHER MORE THE MIGRATION POLICY INSTITUTE FOUND THAT NEARLY HALF OF IMMIGRANTS ADULTS ARRIVING TO THE TO THE U. S. SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE -- AND HOWEVER THERE IS NO IS. REGULATORY PROCESS -- INFRASTRUCTURE TO DAN REEVALUATE THEIR THEIR AT THE CREDENTIALS FROM A FOREIGN COUNTRY. I'M CALIFORNIA HAS MADE A SIGNIFICANT STRIKE TO INTEGRATE ASPIRIN CITIZENS INTO OUR STATE BY PROVIDING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO STOP LIFE FOR PROFESSIONAL LICENSE. AS WELL AS BUSINESSES LICENSE THIS BILL SISTER CONTINUE WITHOUT PROGRESS BY REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS TO CREATE A TASK FORCE TO STUDY IN MY REPORT -- TO PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT HOW TO INTEGRATE THIS IMMIGRANTS FOR ALL THE RACES WHERE -- WE HAVE PROPER SPONSORS OF THIS PARTICULAR BILL IT WILL RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. SEE NINE ANY WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION SEE NO WITNESSES OPPOSITION QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA THANK YOU -- LIKE TO ASK THE AUTHOR WHICH WOULD WHAT KIND OF PROFESSIONS AND AND OUR ENVISIONED. WELL I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ALL OF CURRENTLY HAVE -- SOMEONE THAT IS A MEDICAL DOCTOR -- IN MEXICO AND IS HAVING A VERY DIFFICULT TIME TRYING TO TRANSFER THAT -- THAT LICENSING -- FROM MEXICO NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT -- WE HAVE CERTAIN CRITERIA WHICH IS GREAT BUT THERE'S ADDITIONAL BARRIERS SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT WE HAVE A NURSING SHORTAGE SO I'M THINKING NURSES WOULD BE SOMETHING -- YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT. CAN BE LOOKED AT TEACHERS WE HAD A TEACHER SHORTAGE -- A FEW PROBABLY ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO AND WE WERE. TRANSFERRING TEACHERS FROM THE PHILIPPINES FOR EXAMPLE AND SO I'M LOOKING AT ALL THE PROFESSIONS I'VE MET SO MANY -- IMMIGRANTS AND JUST TO BE CLEAR THIS IS NOT FOR UNDOCUMENTED FOLKS THESE ARE ALL IMMIGRANTS NOT JUST ON DOCUMENTED FOLKS BY THEY ARE PROFESSIONALS IN THEIR OWN COUNTRIES. AND THEY COME HERE AND THEY CAN -- THE BARRIERS THAT WE PUT UPON THEM -- IN PROFESSIONS THAT ARE IN NEED AGAIN LIKE NURSING -- STOP THEM FROM JUST TRANSFERRING -- EASILY INTO OUR OUR SYSTEM AND SAW THE HOPE IS TO LOOK THE TASK FORCE TO LOOK AT YOU KNOW JUST A VARIETY OF OTHER PROFESSIONS BUT SPECIFICALLY. RIGHT NOW IN THE MEDICAL FIELD BUT I KNOW THAT THERE'S MANY MORE THAT WE CAN LOOK AT AND YOU KNOW CREATE A SYSTEM WHERE. THOSE FOLKS CAN COME IN AND JUST BE YOU KNOW WHATEVER IT TAKES BUT MAKE IT EASIER FOR THEM TO APPLY AS OPPOSED TO ALL OF THESE YOU KNOW DIFFERENT. SOME OF THEM HAVE TO START ALL OVER AND GO TO SCHOOL YOU KNOW FOR ANOTHER THREE FOUR YEARS AND THEY'VE ALREADY. COMPLETED THAT EDUCATION IN THEIR RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES AND SO I'M HOPING TO LOOK AT A SIMPLER SYSTEM INSTEAD OF SENDING THEM ALL BACK TO SCHOOL BECAUSE IF THE ANSWER IS. GO BACK TO SCHOOL WITH AND WHY DO THEY NEED US -- RIGHT THEY TO START ALL OVER BY BUT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE EXAMPLES THAT I'M LOOKING AT SPECIFICALLY LIKE I SAID. I HAVE A A DOCTOR WHO WHO HAS TO GO THROUGH A WHOLE BUNCH OF BARRIERS AND WITH THE NURSING SHORTAGE I THINK IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THOSE -- FIELD SPECIFICALLY FOR NOW. YOUR BILL ASKED FOR STUDY YES I PASSED FORCED A TASK FORCE -- IT'S A TOSS WORDS. AT THAT -- THOSE SECRETARY OF BUSINESS AND CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AND AGENCY DOES ANY ONE MEMBER APPOINTED BY THE PRO TEM ANOTHER MMHM -- MEMBER APPOINTED BY THE SPEAKER ONE MEMBER OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA REGENTS ONE MEMBER FROM CAL STATE UNIVERSITY BOARD OF TRUSTEES. ANOTHER MEMBER FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE BOARD -- AND FOR MEMBERS OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR'S FROM THAT THAT DIVERSE REGION -- BUT JUST SO THAT YOU KNOW IF IT'S A UC ISSUE THAN THE UC CAN WEIGH IN ON IT IF IT'S A COMMUNITY COLLEGE ISSUE THOUGH COMMUNITY COLLEGE THIS YOU CAN WEIGH IN. YOU KNOW IT'S SO THAT WE ARE ALL LOOKING AT YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENT -- TYPES OF PROFESSIONS AND SO THAT IF IN FACT IS THE UC'S FOR EXAMPLE THEN THEY CAN SAY WELL THIS IS THE THE WAY WE CAN CUT. THE RED TAPE SO. I I I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL -- YESTERDAY WE HAD A HEARING AND SHORTAGE OF DOCTORS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND AT THE SAME TIME THOSE PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE MAKING REFERENCE TO COME THE UNITED STATES COME TO CALIFORNIA. TRAINED ALREADY TO BE DOCTORS AND MANY TIMES WE ASK THEM TO GO BACK TO SQUARE ONE AND START ALL OVER AGAIN. SO I ALSO IS CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON CALIFORNIA MEXICO I KNOW THAT THIS IS A TOPIC THAT IS MUCH DISCUSS. SO I VERY MUCH -- SUPPORT THE BILL AND THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM CAN MEMBERS AT THIS TIME. SEE NONE AT SOMEONE RUBIO IF YOU WISH TO CLOSE. YES THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS IS DOES ENJOY A TO PASS RECOMMENDATION BUT WE'LL GET TO THAT ONCE WE'VE ESTABLISHED A QUORUM. THANK YOU MISTER CHEN MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NOW GO BACK TO ITEM NUMBER TWO WHICH IS AB. FOR TWENTY BY SOMEONE MEMBER LACKEY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT -- A BEFORE. TWENTY THE GOAL OF THIS BILLS TO SIMPLY GIVE AUTHORIZATION TO THE CENTER FOR MEDICINAL CANNABIS RESEARCH. TO CONTINUE PERFORMING NECESSARY RESEARCH ON THE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE EFFECTS APPEAR CAMPAñA AIDS. AN ASSOCIATE -- COMPOUNDS. THE BILL BROADENS THE SCOPE OF RESEARCH AVAILABLE. TO CMC ARE THAT WOULD ALSO ALLOW THEM THE ABILITY TO CULTIVATE THEIR OWN CANNABIS. THIS PROGRAM IS TASKED WITH DEVELOPING A CONDUCTING STUDIES TO DETERMINE THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF BOTH. CANNABIS ISN'T THAT IT KIND OF ANNOYS. IT'S CRITICAL TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CURRENT CODE. TO ALLOW FOR THE SUCCESS. OF THESE STUDIES IF WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE THIS NEW AND INNOVATIVE FIELD OF RESEARCH IN OUR STATE. THIS BILL PRESENTS RESEARCHERS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND THE HEALTH BENEFITS. THAT CAN BE GAINED FROM THE SUBSTANCE WITH ME TODAY I HAVE DOCTOR TOM WERE CAUGHT WHO IS -- CO DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR MEDICINAL CANNABIS RESEARCH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO. THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME. SO I THOUGHT I'D JUST GIVE YOU A ONE OR TWO MINUTE BACKGROUND REGARDING THE CMC ARE SO THE THE CENTER FROM JUST THE CAMPUSES IS. HOUSE DOWN AT UC SAN DIEGO -- WE DATE BACK TO THE YEAR -- TWO THOUSAND WHEN WE WERE INCORPORATOR ARE CREATED THROUGH LEGISLATION BY THE FORETHOUGHT OF THE LEGISLATIVE BODY HERE AFTER THE COMPASSIONATE USE ACT PASSED -- THERE WAS A STRONG DEMAND FOR HAVING BETTER RESEARCH REGARDING THE POTENTIAL. MEDICINAL BENEFITS ARE NOT OF CANNABIS SO WE RECEIVED FUNDING BACK IN TWO THOUSAND WE CONDUCTED A NUMBER OF CLINICAL TRIALS -- SEVEN LOOKING OUT SMOKED CANNABIS WERE VAPORIZED. AND OVER THE YEARS WE'VE MAINTAINED -- PRETTY STRONG RESEARCH PORTFOLIO FUNDED BY NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH FUNDED BY PHILANTHROPY AS WELL AS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BEEN DOING SOME STUDIES ON IMPAIRED DRIVNG AS WELL RELATED TO KIND OF THIS. THE REASON THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE WHAT WAS IN VISION TWENTY YEARS AGO -- IS NOT COMPLETELY COME TO FRUITION WE ARE NOW TO PLACE WHERE THE UNIVERSE MISSISSIPPI STILL IS THE ONLY SOURCE OF PLANT MATERIAL. AND THEY OF FAIRLY LIMITED RESOURCES IN TERMS OF CREATING THE TYPES OF CANVAS THAT OUR PEOPLE ARE CURRENTLY USING -- WHAT THE VARIOUS CONSTITUENTS OF KIND OF A DOLLAR CBT AND TO SEE THAT WE MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN -- THE D. A. AS ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WOULD OPEN IT UP TO MORE MANUFACTURERS -- BUT SINCE AUGUST TWENTY SIXTEEN NONE HAVE BEEN APPROVED OR EVEN HEARD FEEDBACK. SO WE WOULD LIKE TO POSITION THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO BE IN A POSITION. TO CULTIVATE CANNABIS THAT COULD BE USEFUL FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES. IN THIS CASE THE C. M. C. R. WE ARE NOT CLASS SIZE EXPERTS SO WE WOULD COLLABORATE WITH INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS UC DAVIS. AND IDENTIFYING THE BEST METHOD FOR GROWING CANNABIS -- THE OTHER KEY ASPECT OF THIS OF THIS BILL IS THAT IT BROADENS THE SCOPE OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT SO IN ADDITION TO CANNABIS. CANNABINOIDS LIKE C. V. D. MIGHT BE USEFUL FOR CERTAIN CONDITIONS -- BUT CURRENTLY -- QUITE OFTEN THE CVT YOU GET FROM DIED INCLUDES TEACH YOU SO IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT AUTISM IN CHILDREN YOU MAY NOT WANT TO GET THEM HIGH. AND ARE GOOD SOURCES RIGHT NOW OF CBT WITHOUT THE PSYCHOACTIVE EFFECTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT PEACEFUL FREE TO COME TO MY PHONE NAME INFLATION IF YOU WISH TO DO SO. ALICIA PRIEGO ON BEHALF OF EASE IN SUPPORT. EDDIE FRANCO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE IS WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. THE NINE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COULD BE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME -- SEE NONE JUST -- QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU MISTER LACKEY WITH RESPECT TO THE ENFORCEMENT OF TRACK AND TRACE HOW DO YOU THINK THAT THIS. BILL PROPOSAL WHICH FACTOR IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF TRACK AND TRACE. YEAH I DON'T THINK IT HAS MUCH IMPACT ON ON TRACK AND TRACE BECAUSE OF THIS IS MORE FROM THE RESEARCH ARM. AND ALL THEY'RE TRYING TO DO IS -- BE ABLE TO HAVE THE RIGHT KIND OF PRODUCT SO THEY CAN. GET THE RIGHT KIND OF RESULTS FROM -- THE EXTRACTION EVALUATION OF CBC'S AND THE A PAIRING ASPECTS ALSO. OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- AND SEE NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ARE COMES AT THIS TIME MR LACKEY DO WISH TO CLOSE WE HAVE JUST REAL QUICKLY I WANTED KNOWLEDGE TO WORK THAT. THESE RESEARCHERS OF US SPEARHEADED IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ALL OF CALIFORNIANS. AND IT WILL PERMIT THE RESEARCHERS TO CONTINUE WORKING TOWARDS THAT PARTICULAR GOAL AND I ASK FOR YOUR RIVAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LIKE IT WILL -- ADDRESS THIS. BILL WHEN WE INVEST UP JUST A QUORUM. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER FOUR WHICH IS AB FOR NINETY EIGHT BY ASSEMBLY WOMAN AND WEBER -- AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT TO YOU AB FOUR NINE EIGHT WHICH WOULD EXEMPT VETERANS FROM WHO OWN A SERVICE BUSINESS FOR MANY CITY COUNTY OR STATE BUSINESS LICENSE FEE. OF THIS EXEMPTION ALREADY EXIST FOR VETERANS WHO MAKE AND SELL THEIR OWN MERCHANDISE THIS BILL SEEKS TO EXTEND THE WAIVER -- TO VETERANS WHO PERFORM SERVICES LIKE MY CONSTITUENT MISTER SPENCER. WHEN APPLYING FOR BUSINESS LICENSE FEE WAIVER MRS SPENCER WAS DENIED BECAUSE THE EXEMPTION ONLY APPLIES TO TANGIBLE MERCHANDISE? AB FOUR NINE EIGHT WILL EXPAND THE BUSINESS LICENSE FEE WAIVER TO EXEMPT THAT TRIMS WHO PERFORM SERVICES. THIS BILL WASN'T WILL NOT APPLY TO PROFESSIONAL LICENSES WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF AB FOUR NINE EIGHT AS WE EXPENSE OR A VETERAN OF THE UNITED STATES MARINE AND MUSICIAN. LET ME ALSO SAY AS WE BEGAN THAT -- WE RECOGNIZE THERE'S SOME CONCERN ABOUT THE DEFINITION OF SERVICES AND WE'RE WORKING WITH -- IF FOR THE NEXT COMMITTEE TO PROVIDE SOME AMENDMENTS WORKING WITH THOSE WHO AFFECTED BY IT SO WE WILL WE ARE AMENABLE TO A NARROWING THE SCOPE OF THIS PARTICULAR BILL SO THAT TO DEFINE SERVICES BY THOSE WHO ARE PRACTITIONERS. WHO CAN BASICALLY LEAD US AND GUIDE US IN THAT AREA WE'VE ALSO APPLIED FOR A -- A AMENDMENTS ALSO WE FILE FOR AN AMENDMENT THAT IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE WILL ALSO LIMITED TO PER -- TO SOLE PROPRIETORS SO WOULD NOT BE THOSE WHO ARE IN AND WILL NOT AN APPLIED TO THOSE WHO ARE DOING FRANCHISES AS WELL. SO IT WILL BE A VERY NARAL ONLY SCOPE BILL DEALING WITH SOLE PROPRIETORS WE WILL BE DEFINING WHAT SERVICES ARE ARE IN AND WHAT SERVICES ARE OUT -- AS WE GO TO THE NEXT COMMITTEE SOMEONE TO MAKE THAT STATEMENT IN TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF VETERANS WE'RE ALL CONCERNED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BILL IS NARAL ENOUGH THAT IF COMP WHICH IS WHAT WE WANT TO ACCOMPLISH. OKAY THIS TIME I'D LIKE YOU TO HEAR FROM MR SPENCER. HI HELLO. LADIES AND GENTLEMAN -- I'M RICHARD SMITH SIR AND FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO THANK ALL OF YOU. FOR CONSIDERING THIS ISSUE FOR ME AND FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL VETERANS -- I SERVED IN VIETNAM AS A CREW CHIEF ON A HELICOPTER. I AND EIGHT HUNDRED COMBAT FLIGHT HOURS. ICE HAVE A SERVICE CONNECTED DISABILITY FOR PTSD I WORK AS A MUSICIAN I'M CURRENTLY A VOLUNTEER PANAS THAT THE VA -- IN SAN DIEGO AND I SERVE OTHER VETERANS IN THIS CAPACITY ALSO MY REQUEST FOR A CHANGE IN THIS LOT PRINCIPALLY IS TO HELP OTHER VETERANS IT MIGHT BE IN A SIMILAR SITUATION. AS TO MY OWN. I'M A BANDLEADER IN MY BAND PROVIDES ENTERTAINMENT TO NINE DIFFERENT NURSING HOMES IN THE SAN DIEGO AND SURROUNDING CITIES THESE JOB PAY AS LITTLE AS TWENTY DOLLARS PER PERSON. THIS TRIGGERED THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO ASKING ME TO PAY A CITY. BUSINESS FATE PLUS FEES AND PENALTIES FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS THAT I WORKED IN SAN DIEGO -- THESE FEES AND PENALTIES AMOUNTED TO ALL OF THE INCOME. THAT I HAD FOR MY NURSING HOME JOBS FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR. THIS SEEMED PREPOSTEROUS TO ME HAVE FOR LOOK FOR A AN EXEMPTION. OF FOR THIS -- WAIVER. AND CHECKING STATE LAW I FOUND IT WAS IN FACT I WAS IN FACT EXAM FROM PAYMENT OF ANY CITY BUSINESS LICENSE TAX BECAUSE I'M A VETERAN WHO'S VENDING A WHERE. I IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED CITY OF SAN DIEGO TREASURER'S OFFICE WHICH TOLD ME TO BRING MY DD TWO FOURTEEN AND AND THEY GRANT ME THE WAIVER. HOWEVER WHEN I GOT THERE I SPOKE TO SOMEONE ELSE WHO REFUSED. TO GRANT ME THE WAIVER EVEN THOUGH I HAD CALLED. SPECIFICALLY BEFORE I WENT THERE -- SO A DIFFERENT PERSON SAID THE WAIVER DIDN'T APPLY BECAUSE I'M PROVIDING A SERVICE AND NOT SELLING TANGIBLE GOODS. HOWEVER IN CHECKING THE DEFINITION OF THE WORD WHERE MERRIAM WEBSTER WHICH IS A MAJOR -- DEFINING DICTIONARY. IT DEFINES THE WORD WHERE AS A GOOD OR SERVICE. THEREFORE I DIDN'T KNOW WHY THEY DIDN'T GRANT ME THE WAIVER WHEN I CALL THIS FACT TO THE ATTENTION THE TREASURER'S OFFICE THEY RE ENTERED BOTH. VERBALLY AND IN A WRITTEN LETTER WHEN I ASKED FOR THEIR RESPONSE IN WRITING. THAT THEY DO NOT GO BY THE DEFINITION AND AGAIN STATED SERVICES ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THE LAW WITHOUT A FURTHER -- AMPLIFICATION OF WHAT THE REASON WAS WHY THEY WOULDN'T COVER IT. THE PURPOSE OF THE LOWEST ASSIST VETERANS TO START SMALL BUSINESSES TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES. BUSINESSES IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN INCREASINGLY AND CORD INCLUDE SERVICES VERSUS ASSEMBLY -- SELLING A GOOD I MIGHT POINT OUT THAT IF ONE IS IS -- DESIGNING AND AND SELLING THEIR OWN SOFTWARE SOFTWARE ALTHOUGH ALWAYS ON A TANGIBLE MEDIUM MEDIUM IT IS NOT THE SOFTWARE ITSELF THAT IS BEING -- SOLD PLUS PEOPLE. I MEAN IT IS NOT THE TANGIBLE MEDIUM THAT IS BEING SOLD BUT IT IS THE PRODUCT IRONIC WHICH IS INTANGIBLE SO. BY THAT BEING INTANGIBLE THE CITY'S COULD. DENY VETERANS THE BENEFITS OF CREATING AND SELLING THEIR OWN SOFTWARE THE COMMISSION AND WOULD YOU CARE TO WRAP UP. YES HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THE APPARENT AMBIGUITY OF THE WORD WHERE VETERANS PROVIDE SERVICES ARE POTENTIALLY DENIED THIS BENEFIT FOR THE SAKE OF ALL VETERANS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE ISSUE. I REQUEST THAT THE STATE STATUTE SIXTEEN OO ONE POINT SEVEN BE CLARIFIED. TO INCLUDE THE WORD SERVICES AND AGAIN I APPRECIATE. YOUR GIVING ME THE TIME TO PRESENT THE ISSUE TO YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US HERE IN THE STATE'S CAPITAL ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT.

IN DOING THIS OR IS THIS JUST AS SMALL SAN DIEGO ISSUE WHERE THEY APPRECIATE VETERANS SOMEBODY WHO IS A REPRESENT OF OF CAL VETS THAT I'M IN TOUCH WITH ALSO. PAID A CITY LICENSE FOR HIS CITY AND ESCONDIDO I BELIEVE. AND NOBODY TOLD HIM THAT HE COULD BE EXEMPT FROM THIS -- SO IT IS A WIDER PROBLEM THAN JUST SAN DIEGO IT'S A STATEWIDE PROBLEM AND THERE WAS A SIMILAR PASSED TO TO LIMIT TO ADD SERVICES HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO SACRAMENTO HAS A SPECIAL ALL IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY.
