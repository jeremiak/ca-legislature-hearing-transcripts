THEY BIKESHARE INDUSTRIES

00:45:56.787 --> 00:45:58.255
UNDERGOING A TECHNOLOGICAL

00:45:58.322 --> 00:45:59.756
CHANGE IF YOU WILL.

00:45:59.823 --> 00:46:01.692
SO NEW COMPANIES HAVE COME ON

00:46:01.758 --> 00:46:02.960
THE SCENE.

00:46:03.026 --> 00:46:04.528
A SORT OF DISRUPTING THE OLD

00:46:04.595 --> 00:46:07.431
SCHOOL PARADOX BIKESHARE SYSTEM

00:46:07.498 --> 00:46:09.299
COVER ABOUT DAKHLA SAYS YEAH NOT

00:46:09.366 --> 00:46:11.235

EXACTLY THE SAME THING SCOOTERS

00:46:14.138 --> 00:46:16.340
ARE. ARE. A I THINK THE MOST

00:46:16.406 --> 00:46:18.275
PREVALENT FORM YES I I MYSELF

00:46:18.342 --> 00:46:20.511
WOULD TAKE A SCOOTER I'M NOT A

00:46:20.577 --> 00:46:21.178
VERY GOOD BICYCLIST.

00:46:21.245 --> 00:46:22.446
BUT IN TERMS OF OF THIS PROJECT

00:46:22.513 --> 00:46:23.814
IS.

00:46:23.881 --> 00:46:24.848
THEY'RE BASICALLY BEING

00:46:24.915 --> 00:46:26.483
CHALLENGED BY THE INDUSTRY TO

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:27.751
REEVALUATE THE SCOPE OF THE

00:46:27.818 --> 00:46:29.153
PROJECT AND SO.

00:46:29.219 --> 00:46:30.888
WHILE THEY'RE DOING THAT WE

00:46:30.954 --> 00:46:32.589
NEED THE TIME EXTENSION TO ALLOW

00:46:32.656 --> 00:46:34.525
OF. A TIME EXTENSION OF THIS

00:46:34.591 --> 00:46:35.759
APPROPRIATION TO ALLOW THIS

00:46:35.826 --> 00:46:37.227
PROJECT TO COMPLETE INCOME AND

00:46:37.294 --> 00:46:38.428
FOUR OF FOR CONSTRUCTION

00:46:38.495 --> 00:46:39.863
ALLOCATION.

00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:41.932
IN TERMS OF THE LENGTH OF THE

00:46:41.999 --> 00:46:43.600
APPROPRIATION.

00:46:43.667 --> 00:46:45.302
THE LANGUAGE OR PUTTING FORWARD

00:46:45.369 --> 00:46:46.937
IS CONSISTENT WITH ALL OF THE

00:46:47.004 --> 00:46:49.139
OTHER A. T. P. APPROPRIATION.

00:46:49.206 --> 00:46:51.275

CDC IN THE ADDITIONAL THREE FOR

00:46:54.711 --> 00:46:55.946
INCUMBENTS LIQUIDATION.

00:46:56.013 --> 00:46:57.447
AND THAT GIVES US THE THE SAFEST

00:46:57.514 --> 00:46:58.982
TIME PERIOD AND IT BRINGS IT IN

00:46:59.049 --> 00:46:59.683
LINE WITH.

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:01.084
ALL THE OTHER BUDGET REQUESTS

00:47:01.151 --> 00:47:04.221

00:47:08.425 --> 00:47:08.992
PRETTY.

00:47:09.059 --> 00:47:11.495
BETWEEN BIKESHARE SYSTEM SO HOW

00:47:11.562 --> 00:47:14.398
COULD I WE HAVE A UNUSUAL.

00:47:14.464 --> 00:47:16.099

00:47:19.303 --> 00:47:21.438
TWO BIKESHARE SYSTEMS THAT.

00:47:21.505 --> 00:47:24.074
I DON'T TALK TO ONE ANOTHER.

00:47:24.141 --> 00:47:26.343
AND YET WE HAVE EIGHTY EIGHT

00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:28.212

.

00:47:37.588 --> 00:47:39.957
BEGIN THEIR PROGRAMS BEFORE.

00:47:40.023 --> 00:47:42.659
THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES BEGAN

00:47:42.726 --> 00:47:44.061
THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND LA

00:47:44.127 --> 00:47:46.763
METRO BEGAN THEIR PROGRAM.

AND WE NOW HAVE.

00:47:48.999 --> 00:47:50.834
TWO DIFFERENT SYSTEMS

00:47:50.901 --> 00:47:53.770
AND. HOT AND IN ONE KIND OF

00:47:53.837 --> 00:47:57.307

00:48:08.852 --> 00:48:11.388
PUTTING AND A DIFFERENT SYSTEM.

00:48:11.455 --> 00:48:13.991
BOB WHICH IS JUST KIND OF CRAZY

00:48:14.057 --> 00:48:14.925
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE.

00:48:14.992 --> 00:48:16.693
.

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:18.829

INCREASED RATIO OF OUT SOURCING.

00:51:06.830 --> 00:51:08.532
TO FOURTEEN PERCENT.

00:51:08.598 --> 00:51:09.900
THAT WE UNDERSTAND THEY PLAN TO

NUMBERS THEY'RE PROPOSING TO

00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:22.546

PER POSITION.

00:51:47.737 --> 00:51:49.306
TO OUTSOURCE THAT WORK CAN WE

00:51:49.372 --> 00:51:51.074
THINK THAT THAT CAN BE DONE MORE

00:51:51.141 --> 00:51:54.110
ECONOMICALLY IF WE STAFF UP. SP

00:51:54.177 --> 00:51:55.479
ONE HAS BEEN PASSED FOR A YEAR

00:51:55.545 --> 00:51:57.047
NOW THE DEPARTMENTS HAD SOME

00:51:57.113 --> 00:51:58.782

01:17:48.296 --> 01:17:49.564
THEN BEHIND THE METER ENERGY

01:17:49.631 --> 01:17:50.165
CONSUMPTION WERE UP TO NEARLY

01:17:50.232 --> 01:17:51.199
SIX.

01:17:51.266 --> 01:17:54.536
GIGAWATTS OF BEHIND THE METER.

01:17:54.603 --> 01:17:56.471
CHIEFLY ROOFTOP SOLAR THAT'S

01:17:56.538 --> 01:17:58.740
BROUGHT DOWN THE OVERALL CHARGES

01:17:58.807 --> 01:17:59.841
AND CONSEQUENTLY THIS.

01:17:59.908 --> 01:18:02.844
BUT FUND WE ARE IN CALIFORNIA

01:18:02.911 --> 01:18:05.147
THE LOWEST PER CAPITA CONSUMER

01:18:05.213 --> 01:18:07.516
OF ENERGY IN THE COUNTRY. SO.

01:18:07.582 --> 01:18:08.750
THAT'S BEEN THE NATURE OF THE

01:18:08.817 --> 01:18:10.452
PROBLEM IN COUPLED WITH THAT IN

01:18:10.519 --> 01:18:11.887
THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE FLAG

01:18:11.953 --> 01:18:13.255
THIS FOR THE LEGISLATURE SEVERAL

01:18:13.321 --> 01:18:14.523
YEARS AGO BUT COUPLED WITH THAT

01:18:14.589 --> 01:18:15.724
WITH THE PASSAGE OF SB THREE

01:18:15.791 --> 01:18:17.259
FIFTY. AND SOME OTHER

01:18:17.325 --> 01:18:18.593
LEGISLATION WE'VE GOT IT BUT

01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:20.162
ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES

01:18:20.228 --> 01:18:22.497
PENSION HAVE GONE UP WHILE OUR

01:18:22.564 --> 01:18:24.232
REVENUES HAVE HAVE GONE DOWN.

01:18:24.299 --> 01:18:26.368
THAT'S WHAT BRINGS US HERE TODAY

01:18:26.435 --> 01:18:28.670
WE DID LAST YEAR SLASH FIFTEEN

01:18:28.737 --> 01:18:30.405
MILLION DOLLARS FROM OUR BUDGET.

01:18:30.472 --> 01:18:33.575
BUT WE'RE DOWN TO WHERE WE NEED

01:18:33.642 --> 01:18:34.176
TO MAKE SOME SHIPS IN ORDER TO

01:18:34.242 --> 01:18:34.609
ROOM

01:18:34.676 --> 01:18:35.343
AND.

01:18:35.410 --> 01:18:38.914
REMAIN WHOLE SO THE PROPOSAL DE

01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:41.049
CALLS FOR A COUPLE THINGS MAINLY.

01:18:41.116 --> 01:18:43.351
REMOVING A SIGNIFICANT CHUNK OF

01:18:43.418 --> 01:18:44.319
FUNDS THE DEFICIT IS ABOUT

01:18:44.386 --> 01:18:46.688
FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR

01:18:46.755 --> 01:18:48.123
SORE PROPOSAL TO MOVE.

01:18:48.190 --> 01:18:49.724
.

01:18:49.791 --> 01:18:52.561
A NUMBER OF POSITIONS FROM THE

01:18:52.627 --> 01:18:55.597
IRP ACCOUNT TO THE COIA COST OF

01:18:55.664 --> 01:18:56.965
IMPLEMENTATION ACCOUNT WE WENT

01:18:57.032 --> 01:18:59.134
AND IDENTIFIED POSITIONS THAT

01:18:59.201 --> 01:19:00.502
ARE CONDUCTOR PERFORMING

01:19:00.569 --> 01:19:01.903
ACTIVITIES THAT ARE CONSISTENT

01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:03.305
WITH THE COIL ACCOUNT NAMELY

01:19:03.371 --> 01:19:04.940
REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS

01:19:05.006 --> 01:19:06.641
EMISSIONS. AND SO THE PROPOSALS

01:19:06.708 --> 01:19:08.009
TO SHIFT A NUMBER OF POSITIONS

01:19:08.076 --> 01:19:10.345
THERE UP SECOND WERE PROPOSING

01:19:10.412 --> 01:19:12.814
TO CONVERT OTHER POSITIONS FROM

01:19:12.881 --> 01:19:14.449
A FUND KNOWN AS THE E. THE

01:19:14.516 --> 01:19:16.084
ENERGY FACILITY LICENSE FUND SO

01:19:16.151 --> 01:19:18.720
WHEN YOU. ARE A POWER PLANT.

01:19:18.787 --> 01:19:20.789
OPERATOR ANYONE ABOUT IT TO

01:19:20.856 --> 01:19:22.724
BUILD A POWER PLANT. WE'RE THE

01:19:22.791 --> 01:19:24.793
AGENCY THAT PERMITS THOSE.

01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:26.628
THOSE THOSE PLANS AND CONDUCTS

01:19:26.695 --> 01:19:28.897
OF A YEAR LONG A LICENSING

01:19:28.964 --> 01:19:32.300
ANALYSIS ON THAT AND SO WE WOULD

01:19:32.367 --> 01:19:32.901
SHIP SOME OF THOSE POSITIONS.

01:19:32.968 --> 01:19:35.570
OVER TO THE FUND THAT IS

01:19:35.637 --> 01:19:37.105
GENERATED BY THOSE ACTIVITIES

01:19:37.172 --> 01:19:38.807
OFF OF THE IRP ACCOUNT AGAIN TO

01:19:38.874 --> 01:19:40.175
RELIEVE SOME MORE THE PRESSURE

01:19:40.242 --> 01:19:40.542
ON THE ON THE.

01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:42.911
PER COUNT AND FINALLY IN THIS

01:19:42.978 --> 01:19:43.678
IS NOT SOMETHING FOR THE

01:19:43.745 --> 01:19:45.380
LEGISLATURE BUT WILL NOTED HERE.

01:19:45.447 --> 01:19:46.882
WE PROPOSE THAT STATUTORILY WERE

01:19:46.948 --> 01:19:48.884
ALLOWED IN NOVEMBER OF EACH YEAR

01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:51.219
TO RAISE THAT SURCHARGE THAT WE

01:19:51.286 --> 01:19:52.754
HAVE THE GENERATES THOSE FUNDS.

01:19:52.821 --> 01:19:54.089
BUT AND WERE AT THE NEAR THE

01:19:54.156 --> 01:19:55.490
CAPS WE CAN RAISE A BY ONE

01:19:55.557 --> 01:19:57.993
ADDITIONAL MILL. WHICH IS ABOUT

01:19:58.059 --> 01:20:00.395
SEVEN CENTS PER RESIDENTIAL

01:20:00.462 --> 01:20:02.164
CONSUMER PER YEAR SUCH A VERY

01:20:02.230 --> 01:20:03.131
MODEST INCREASE BUT IT DOES

01:20:03.198 --> 01:20:04.132
GENERATE ABOUT TWO AND A HALF

01:20:04.199 --> 01:20:06.001
MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. THAT

01:20:06.067 --> 01:20:06.935
WOULD GO INTO THEIR PARK OUT.

01:20:07.002 --> 01:20:08.503
THANK YOU.

01:20:08.570 --> 01:20:11.139
THANK YOU.

01:20:11.206 --> 01:20:13.108
ANY QUESTIONS LA RAIL.

01:20:13.175 --> 01:20:13.775
COM YEAH.

01:20:13.842 --> 01:20:15.977
THIS PROPOSAL REPRESENTS A SCAN

01:20:16.044 --> 01:20:17.479
SIGNIFICANT IN OUR VIEW A

01:20:17.546 --> 01:20:18.680
REASONABLE STEP FORWARD IN

01:20:18.747 --> 01:20:19.748
ADDRESSING THE.

01:20:19.814 --> 01:20:22.584
THE DEFICIT IN THE FUNDS.

01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:23.885
WE WE DON'T HAVE ANY INITIAL

01:20:23.952 --> 01:20:24.686
CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSED

01:20:24.753 --> 01:20:31.092
CHANGES WE DOLLAR.

01:20:31.159 --> 01:20:32.194
IS IT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS GOING

01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:33.595
FORWARD AND SO.

01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:35.797
IT'S WITHOUT ITS PROJECTED TO

01:20:35.864 --> 01:20:37.465
GO INSOLVENT TWENTY TWENTY TWO

01:20:37.532 --> 01:20:40.602
TWENTY THREE SO THERE'S A THERE

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:41.203
IS SOME MORE TIME TO KIND OF

01:20:41.269 --> 01:20:41.836
ADDRESS IT BUT THE LEGISLATURE

01:20:41.903 --> 01:20:43.371
WILL LIKELY HAVE TO TAKE SOME

01:20:43.438 --> 01:20:44.906
ADDITIONAL ACTIONS. IN THE NEXT

01:20:44.973 --> 01:20:47.809
COUPLE YEARS AND THE.

01:20:47.909 --> 01:20:47.976
.

01:20:48.043 --> 01:20:48.276
PART OF THE.

01:20:48.343 --> 01:20:49.811
.

01:20:49.878 --> 01:20:51.446
RESOLUTION HERE IS TAKING FUNDS

01:20:51.513 --> 01:20:53.815
FROM THE KOREA COUNTER SHIFTING

01:20:53.882 --> 01:20:55.550
BECAUSE OF THE DEMANDS OF THE

01:20:55.617 --> 01:20:57.786
QUAKE COUNT. HOW SOLVENT IS THAT

01:20:57.852 --> 01:21:00.055
FUND AND?

01:21:00.121 --> 01:21:01.489
IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT BUNDIST

01:21:01.556 --> 01:21:06.661
GENERATING A SURPLUS.

01:21:06.728 --> 01:21:07.729
AGAIN AMENDMENT PARTNER FINANCE

01:21:07.796 --> 01:21:11.433
BE UP QUITE A FIND IS OF THE THE

01:21:11.499 --> 01:21:12.067
CHARGES THAT GOING TO FIND OUR

01:21:12.133 --> 01:21:12.667
REASSESS OUR LOOKED AT EVERY

01:21:12.734 --> 01:21:13.735
YEAR BASED ON WHAT THE

01:21:13.802 --> 01:21:14.769
APPROPRIATION LEVEL IS AND SO

01:21:14.836 --> 01:21:15.403
THOSE THOSE WILL BE ADJUSTED.

01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:17.839
BASED ON THE TOTAL PROPOSALS NOT

01:21:17.906 --> 01:21:18.640
ONLY THIS ONE BUT I THINK ONCE

01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:19.608
THE IMPACT THAT FUND SO THAT IT

01:21:19.674 --> 01:21:21.076
WILL MAINTAIN SOLVENCY AND WE

01:21:21.142 --> 01:21:22.811
DID HAVE THERE'S A LETTER OF

01:21:22.877 --> 01:21:25.714
CONCURRENCE FROM THE TIME AIR

01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:30.151

IT TO THE TO THE ALEJO.

01:21:36.091 --> 01:21:37.058
A FUND.

01:21:37.125 --> 01:21:37.926
WE'LL GO INSOLVENT BY GET WHAT

01:21:37.993 --> 01:21:38.159
TWENTY.

01:21:38.226 --> 01:21:40.262
EIGHT.

01:21:40.328 --> 01:21:41.630
WHEN YOU SEE TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY

01:21:41.696 --> 01:21:43.331
TWO TWENTY THREE THAT'S THE

01:21:43.398 --> 01:21:44.899
PROJECTION GIVEN YOU KNOW

01:21:44.966 --> 01:21:45.500
THERE'S A VARIETY OF FACTORS

01:21:45.567 --> 01:21:47.402
THAT ARE UNCERTAIN THAT'S THE

01:21:47.469 --> 01:21:48.837
PRODUCTION THAT WE'VE BEEN GIVEN.

01:21:48.903 --> 01:21:51.373
SO THE.

01:21:51.439 --> 01:21:52.140
WILL YOU BE COMING BACK TO US

01:21:52.207 --> 01:21:54.242
SOON TO RAISE THE CAP ON THE

01:21:54.309 --> 01:21:55.277
FIFTH ON THAT.

01:21:55.343 --> 01:21:57.078
THE CHARGE RATEPAYERS.

01:21:57.145 --> 01:21:58.947
WELL WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH IS

01:21:59.014 --> 01:22:00.181
IS IT MY COLLEAGUES TO MY RIGHT

01:22:00.248 --> 01:22:02.284
CAN ATTEST. REGULARLY WITH

01:22:02.350 --> 01:22:03.485
DIFFERENT FINE IT'S LOOKING AT

01:22:03.551 --> 01:22:04.819
OTHER OTHER SOLUTIONS AS I

01:22:04.886 --> 01:22:06.254
POINTED OUT IN MY TESTIMONY WE

01:22:06.321 --> 01:22:08.023
HAVE REDUCED OUR COSTS WE

01:22:08.089 --> 01:22:08.957
CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR

01:22:09.024 --> 01:22:10.692
OPPORTUNITIES TO DO THAT.

01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:12.894
SO THERE'S A SUITE OF OPTIONS

01:22:12.961 --> 01:22:14.729
WERE CONSIDERING AS WE LOOK AT

01:22:14.796 --> 01:22:15.730
THIS BUT.

01:22:15.797 --> 01:22:18.099
AS AS ALEJO POINTS OUT THERE IS

01:22:18.166 --> 01:22:20.201
A OUT HERE DEFICIT.

01:22:20.268 --> 01:22:22.570
STRUCTURALLY AND WERE WE'RE

01:22:22.637 --> 01:22:24.639
LOOKING AT WAYS TO CLOSE IT

01:22:24.706 --> 01:22:26.474
RIGHT THAT I HEARD YOU SAY THAT.

01:22:26.541 --> 01:22:28.443
YOU'RE NOW YOU ARE YOU ARE YOU

01:22:28.510 --> 01:22:30.445
ARE RAISING THE FEE.

01:22:30.512 --> 01:22:32.280
TO ITS CAP SO YOU DON'T HAVE ANY

01:22:32.347 --> 01:22:34.249
OTHER ROOM.

01:22:34.316 --> 01:22:35.650
TO CLOSE THIS DEFICIT UNLESS YOU

01:22:35.717 --> 01:22:37.018
CUT.

01:22:37.085 --> 01:22:37.886
EXPENDITURES

01:22:37.952 --> 01:22:40.355
THAT'S RIGHT.

01:22:40.422 --> 01:22:42.324
DO YOU INTEND.

01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:45.493
DO YOU INTEND TO COME BACK.

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:47.595
FERRICK FOR IT FOR.

01:22:47.662 --> 01:22:49.698
LIFTING THE CAP

01:22:49.764 --> 01:22:50.365
I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE QUALIFIED

01:22:50.432 --> 01:22:51.466
WHAT I SAID THAT LOWERING

01:22:51.533 --> 01:22:52.867
EXPENDITURES IS ONE OPTION

01:22:52.934 --> 01:22:53.902
ANOTHER OPTION IS THERE ARE

01:22:53.968 --> 01:22:55.704
ADDITIONAL WAYS THAT FUNDS CAN

01:22:55.770 --> 01:22:57.372
BE SHIFTED FROM ONE ACCOUNT TO

01:22:57.439 --> 01:22:59.007
ANOTHER SO THIS IS ONLY ONE OF.

01:22:59.074 --> 01:23:00.642
A DOZEN OR MORE ACCOUNTS THAT WE

01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:02.610
HAVE AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION

01:23:02.677 --> 01:23:03.411
AND WE PARTIED WOULD DESCRIBE

01:23:03.478 --> 01:23:04.212
SOME OF THE SHIPS THIS MORNING

01:23:04.279 --> 01:23:06.247
AND THERE ARE OTHERS. SO PART OF

01:23:06.314 --> 01:23:07.482
IT COULD BE SHIFTING FUNDS NOT

01:23:07.549 --> 01:23:08.516
NECESSARILY.

01:23:08.583 --> 01:23:10.652
EITHER REDUCING OR INCREASING

01:23:10.719 --> 01:23:12.921
FUNDS TO THE HERBA COUNTED DOES

01:23:12.987 --> 01:23:14.189
THE LA JOH.

01:23:14.255 --> 01:23:14.789
I THINK THAT THERE'S ENOUGH.

01:23:14.856 --> 01:23:18.293
.

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:20.395
AB ABILITY IN IT INTER.

01:23:20.462 --> 01:23:22.630
DEPARTMENTAL FUND.

01:23:22.697 --> 01:23:25.200
IN INTER ACCOUNT SHIFTING.

01:23:25.266 --> 01:23:26.267
IN ORDER LOSE THE GAP BY TWENTY

01:23:26.334 --> 01:23:28.303
TWENTY FOUR.

01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:29.804
I MEAN I THINK IT'S THAT'S HARD

01:23:29.871 --> 01:23:30.405
TO SAY.

01:23:30.472 --> 01:23:34.209
I THINK WE. WILL CONTINUE TO

01:23:34.275 --> 01:23:35.276
WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT I THINK

01:23:35.343 --> 01:23:36.511
IN THE OUTTA KINDA TRY TO

01:23:36.578 --> 01:23:37.746
IDENTIFY WHAT THOSE

01:23:37.812 --> 01:23:38.913
OPPORTUNITIES ARE I THINK.

01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:40.915
ONE OTHER THING THAT WE ARE

01:23:40.982 --> 01:23:42.584
NOTED IN THE ADMINISTRATION PUT

01:23:42.650 --> 01:23:44.219
FORWARD OUT A REPORT ON THIS

01:23:44.285 --> 01:23:46.354
ISSUE JUST A FEW DAYS AGO. A ONE

01:23:46.421 --> 01:23:47.389
OF THE THINGS THAT IS IN THAT

01:23:47.455 --> 01:23:48.957
REPORT IS THERE ARE SOME

01:23:49.023 --> 01:23:51.025
PROGRAMS LIKE PROP THIRTY NINE

01:23:51.092 --> 01:23:52.861
FOR EXAMPLE THAT RECEIVE SOME OF

01:23:52.927 --> 01:23:53.027
THE.

01:23:53.094 --> 01:23:54.362
BUT FUNDING.

01:23:54.429 --> 01:23:56.264
AND STE SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES

01:23:56.331 --> 01:23:57.832
RELATED TO THOSE PROGRAMS COULD

01:23:57.899 --> 01:23:59.934
BE EXPIRING AND FUTURE YEARS IN

01:24:00.001 --> 01:24:01.736
SUCH AN EXTENT THAT OCCURS IN

01:24:01.803 --> 01:24:02.270
THAT WOULD FREE UP SOME
