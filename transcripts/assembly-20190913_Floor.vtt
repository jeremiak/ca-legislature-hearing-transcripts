LONG BEEN A FEDERALIST IT IS

09:58:52.429 --> 09:58:54.598
ASTONISHING TO ME. THIS IS A

09:58:54.665 --> 09:58:57.034
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TAKING DOWN

IS BEEN BLOWN UP TO BE MORE

09:59:10.114 --> 09:59:11.548
THAN IT REALLY IS THIS IS

09:59:11.615 --> 09:59:13.884
CALIFORNIA WHO HAS RELIED ON

09:59:13.951 --> 09:59:16.854
FEDERAL POLICY FOR MANY YEARS

09:59:16.920 --> 09:59:17.721
GOOD FEDERAL ENVIRONMENTAL

09:59:17.788 --> 09:59:20.124
POLICY FOR MANY YEARS. AND WE

09:59:20.190 --> 09:59:20.524

ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY. WITH GAPS

09:59:23.527 --> 09:59:25.229
IN IT BECAUSE OF WHAT THE FEDS

09:59:25.296 --> 09:59:27.531

PROTECTION LAW AND CALIFORNIA

09:59:34.104 --> 09:59:36.540

09:59:36.607 --> 09:59:38.509
IS FILLING THAT VOID THERE IS

09:59:38.575 --> 09:59:40.711
NO OTHER TIME TO BE DOING IT

09:59:40.778 --> 09:59:43.614
RATHER THAN NOW BECAUSE THE

09:59:43.681 --> 09:59:46.450

TEARING DOWN WHAT WE HAVE LONG

09:59:53.424 --> 09:59:56.894

ONE WE INHERITED. AND RIGHT NOW

10:06:45.836 --> 10:06:47.771
THIS ISN'T A PARTISAN ISSUE I

10:06:47.838 --> 10:06:49.806
WANT TO REMIND THIS BODY THAT

10:06:49.873 --> 10:06:50.340

APPRECIATE THE ROBUST DEBATE

10:08:13.623 --> 10:08:14.724
IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT WE HAVE

10:08:14.791 --> 10:08:16.159
THAT AND LEGISLATION THAT IS

10:08:16.226 --> 10:08:17.694
SWEEPING AND IMPORTANT SUCH AS

10:08:17.761 --> 10:08:19.796
THIS ONE. AND I WOULD LIKE TO

10:08:19.863 --> 10:08:20.430
TAKE A MOMENT TO ADDRESS SOME

10:08:20.497 --> 10:08:21.298
OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN

10:08:21.364 --> 10:08:24.234
RAISED. FIRST OF ALL I WANTED

10:08:24.301 --> 10:08:24.801
TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THE BILL

10:08:24.868 --> 10:08:27.170
DOES TOO AND WHAT IT DOESN'T DO.

10:08:27.237 --> 10:08:30.173
THE BILL DOES NOT. UNDERMINE

10:08:30.240 --> 10:08:32.075
VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS. IN TERMS

10:08:32.142 --> 10:08:34.611
OF WATER. ISSUES THOSE

10:08:34.678 --> 10:08:35.745
VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS ARE NOT

10:08:35.812 --> 10:08:37.480
REGULATIONS THERE VOLUNTARY

10:08:37.547 --> 10:08:39.349
AGREEMENTS THAT ARE AGREED TO

10:08:39.416 --> 10:08:40.851
BY VARIOUS PARTIES AND

10:08:40.917 --> 10:08:42.352
THEREFORE NOT AFFECTED BY THIS

10:08:42.419 --> 10:08:44.120
BILL. AND IN FACT THOSE

10:08:44.187 --> 10:08:45.255
AGREEMENTS ARE NOT EVEN IN

10:08:45.322 --> 10:08:46.323
PLACE YET AS THEY ARE STILL

10:08:46.389 --> 10:08:48.558
BEING NEGOTIATED. I REMEMBER.

10:08:48.625 --> 10:08:50.493
THIS BILL IS ABOUT REGULATIONS

10:08:50.560 --> 10:08:52.696
THAT EXIST TODAY. NOT REGULAR

10:08:52.762 --> 10:08:55.465
NOT AGREEMENTS THAT ARE GOING

10:08:55.532 --> 10:08:55.999
TO BE ENTERED INTO OVER A

10:08:56.066 --> 10:08:58.702
PERIOD OF TIME. THIS BILL WILL

10:08:58.768 --> 10:09:00.570
NOT TURN AREAS OF THE STATE

10:09:00.637 --> 10:09:03.840
INTO A DUST BOWL. IF THEY'RE

10:09:03.907 --> 10:09:06.376
NOT A DUST BOWL TODAY NOTHING

10:09:06.443 --> 10:09:08.478
SHOULD CHANGE IN TERMS OF THE

10:09:08.545 --> 10:09:11.181
WAY THAT THEIR WATER IS

10:09:11.248 --> 10:09:11.815
DELIVERED IN THE WILL AND THEIR

10:09:11.882 --> 10:09:14.351
WATER RIGHTS ARE ENACTED. THIS

10:09:14.417 --> 10:09:15.752
BILL DOES NOT FREE SCIENCE. IN

10:09:15.819 --> 10:09:21.491
FACT. WITH THE IN RESPONSE TO

10:09:21.558 --> 10:09:23.260
SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE

10:09:23.326 --> 10:09:24.494
RAISED BY SENATOR FEINSTEIN AND

10:09:24.561 --> 10:09:26.263
OTHER STAKEHOLDERS THE VERY

10:09:26.329 --> 10:09:28.398
IMPORTANT SECTION THAT DEALS

10:09:28.465 --> 10:09:30.934
WITH WATER REGULATIONS WAS

10:09:31.001 --> 10:09:33.670
CHANGE FROM SHOWER TO MAY TO

10:09:33.737 --> 10:09:35.972
GIVE US THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

10:09:36.039 --> 10:09:38.708
THE FLEXIBILITY TO DECIDE WHICH

10:09:38.775 --> 10:09:40.210
OF THOSE REGULATIONS AND WE

10:09:40.277 --> 10:09:42.879
WANT TO CONTINUE TO IMPOSE

10:09:42.946 --> 10:09:43.980
RATHER THAN THE FEDERAL

10:09:44.047 --> 10:09:46.850
GOVERNMENT TAKING THAT

10:09:46.917 --> 10:09:47.450
RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT RIGHT.

10:09:47.517 --> 10:09:53.223
AWAY FROM US. THE BILL DOES NOT

10:09:53.290 --> 10:09:54.024
WAS NOT SPRUNG ON THE

10:09:54.090 --> 10:09:55.892
LEGISLATURE IN THE LAST MINUTE

10:09:55.959 --> 10:09:57.327
OR NEGOTIATE INNER DARKNESS IN

10:09:57.394 --> 10:09:58.728
FACT THIS BILL WAS INTRODUCED

10:09:58.795 --> 10:10:00.230
EARLY IN THE SESSION WAS

10:10:00.297 --> 10:10:02.065
DEBATED MULTIPLE TIMES IN

10:10:02.132 --> 10:10:04.267
COMMITTEE. THERE WERE HOURS AND

10:10:04.334 --> 10:10:05.368
HOURS OF MEETINGS WITH

10:10:05.435 --> 10:10:07.170
STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS THE STATE

10:10:07.237 --> 10:10:08.505
THAT RESULTED IN MANY

10:10:08.571 --> 10:10:09.773
AMENDMENTS BEING TAKEN THE

10:10:09.839 --> 10:10:12.075
ROUTE THE PAST YEAR AND I THINK

10:10:12.142 --> 10:10:13.043
MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT BECAUSE

10:10:13.109 --> 10:10:14.678
THIS BILL HAS BEEN DISCUSSED IN

10:10:14.744 --> 10:10:17.280
THIS BODY SINCE IT WAS FIRST

10:10:17.347 --> 10:10:17.847
INTRODUCED. GOING BACK INTO

10:10:17.914 --> 10:10:21.117
LAST YEAR. WHAT THE BILL DOES

10:10:21.184 --> 10:10:22.786
DO IS GIVE US TOOLS TO MAINTAIN

10:10:22.852 --> 10:10:26.856
WHAT WE HAVE NOW. NOW. ONE OF

10:10:26.923 --> 10:10:27.824
THE THINGS THAT WAS BROUGHT UP

10:10:27.891 --> 10:10:28.858
OVER AND OVER AGAIN WAS THAT

10:10:28.925 --> 10:10:30.427
THIS IS A POLITICAL GESTURE

10:10:30.493 --> 10:10:31.962
THIS IS HYPERBOLE THIS IS A

10:10:32.028 --> 10:10:32.462

10:10:32.529 --> 10:10:36.933
STATEMENT. WHAT THIS IS A LACKS

10:10:37.000 --> 10:10:38.468
JUST DITCH EFFORT FOR

10:10:38.535 --> 10:10:41.037
CALIFORNIA TO PROTECT. WHAT WE

10:10:41.104 --> 10:10:42.339
HAVE HAD IN PLACE IN IN SOME

10:10:42.405 --> 10:10:44.274
REGARDS TAKEN FOR GRANTED FOR

10:10:44.341 --> 10:10:47.510
DECADES. ACTIONS THAT WERE

10:10:47.577 --> 10:10:50.013
NEGOTIATED FOR YEARS ON A

BIPARTISAN BASIS ON THE FLOOR

10:10:52.048 --> 10:10:53.516

12:13:14.817 --> 12:13:15.651
GOOD POINTS I THINK THERE ARE A

12:13:15.718 --> 12:13:16.585
FEW THAT WE WANT TO ADD TO THIS

12:13:16.652 --> 12:13:18.120
NUMBER ONE GOVERNOR BROWN DID

12:13:18.187 --> 12:13:20.022

THIS MEASURE. UNANIMOUSLY I

12:13:28.831 --> 12:13:33.903

12:13:37.673 --> 12:13:40.676

IN THIS ROOM. AND THIS IS A

12:13:43.713 --> 12:13:46.882
YOUNGER LEGISLATURE NOW WE HAVE

12:13:46.949 --> 12:13:47.416
A LOT MORE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

12:13:47.483 --> 12:13:51.554
YOUNG CHILDREN AT HOME. SO IT'S

12:13:51.620 --> 12:13:53.956
POSSIBLE THAT YOUR YOUNG

12:13:54.023 --> 12:13:56.192

FOUR THIRTY IN THE MORNING TO

12:14:10.773 --> 12:14:13.509
GET A PRACTICE. TO SUGGEST THAT

12:14:13.576 --> 12:14:15.378
THIS IS A LOCALIZED ISSUE

12:14:15.444 --> 12:14:16.979
BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

12:14:17.046 --> 12:14:19.348
STAYING OUT LATER AND DRINKING

12:14:19.415 --> 12:14:21.050
WILL ONLY STAY IN THAT LOCAL

12:14:21.117 --> 12:14:22.852
AREA TO DRIVE HOME. IS A FALSE

12:14:22.918 --> 12:14:25.121
ASSUMPTION THEY'RE GOING TO GO

12:14:25.187 --> 12:14:28.657

IN EVERYONE ELSE'S CHILDREN AT

12:14:32.061 --> 12:14:35.331
RISK. BY HAVING MORE PEOPLE WHO

12:14:35.398 --> 12:14:37.333
RIDE TOO MUCH TO DRINK ON THE

12:14:37.400 --> 12:14:38.701
ROAD HE COULD POSSIBLY TAKE THE

12:14:38.768 --> 12:14:42.371
LIVES. OF YOUR BABIES YOUR

12:14:42.438 --> 12:14:44.273
CHILDREN YOU THINK VERY

12:14:44.340 --> 12:14:46.942
CAREFULLY ABOUT IS IT WORTH IT.

12:14:47.009 --> 12:14:49.178
TO ALLOW A FEW MORE HOURS OF

12:14:49.245 --> 12:14:52.748
DRINKING ISN'T WORTH IT. TO PUT

12:14:52.815 --> 12:14:55.918
CHILDREN AT RISK. I ORIGINAL

12:14:55.985 --> 12:15:02.591
VOTE. MEASURE OF ARNOLDI THANK

12:15:02.658 --> 12:15:04.427
YOU MISTER SPEAKER I AM NOT A

12:15:04.493 --> 12:15:06.362
PARTICULAR FAN OF BARS AND

12:15:06.429 --> 12:15:07.830
THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW ME KNOW

12:15:07.897 --> 12:15:09.432
I'M PROBABLY AMONGST THE LEAST

12:15:09.498 --> 12:15:11.467
LIKELY TO BE FOUND AT A BAR AT

12:15:11.534 --> 12:15:13.602
THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING.

12:15:13.669 --> 12:15:15.271
HOWEVER I AM A FAN ALSO OF

12:15:15.337 --> 12:15:18.007
LOCAL CONTROL LIKE MOST OF YOU.

12:15:18.073 --> 12:15:19.508
I SERVED IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT I

12:15:19.575 --> 12:15:20.910
WAS THE MAYOR OF A CITY AND I

12:15:20.976 --> 12:15:22.545
REMEMBER VIVIDLY. HOW

12:15:22.611 --> 12:15:24.914
FRUSTRATING IT WAS TO BE TOLD

12:15:24.980 --> 12:15:26.749
BY PEOPLE IN SACRAMENTO WHAT

12:15:26.816 --> 12:15:27.316
WAS RIGHT AND WHAT WAS WRONG

12:15:27.383 --> 12:15:30.419
FOR MY COMMUNITY. AND THAT'S

12:15:30.486 --> 12:15:30.986
WHY I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS

12:15:31.053 --> 12:15:31.854
BILL TODAY AND I THINK IT'S

12:15:31.921 --> 12:15:33.956
IMPORTANT TO NOTE. THAT THIS IS

12:15:34.023 --> 12:15:37.326
NOT A STATE WIDE LAW THIS IS A

12:15:37.393 --> 12:15:40.062
NARROWLY TARGETED PILOT PROGRAM.

12:15:40.129 --> 12:15:40.996
OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE

12:15:41.063 --> 12:15:43.332
SUPPOSED TO BE. THE CRUCIBLE OF

12:15:43.399 --> 12:15:45.034
EXPERIMENTATION AND GOVERNMENT

12:15:45.100 --> 12:15:46.235
AND THIS IS A WAY OF FINDING

12:15:46.302 --> 12:15:48.537
OUT WHETHER OR NOT. SOME OF THE

12:15:48.604 --> 12:15:49.071
OBJECTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN

12:15:49.138 --> 12:15:51.006
RAISED HERE TONIGHT ARE TRUE.

12:15:51.073 --> 12:15:52.274
THESE COMMUNITIES HAVE ALREADY

12:15:52.341 --> 12:15:54.276
EXPRESSED A WILLINGNESS TO BE

12:15:54.343 --> 12:15:56.812
PART OF THE PILOT PROGRAM. THEY

12:15:56.879 --> 12:15:58.647
HAVE ALREADY ARE DECIDED AT THE

12:15:58.714 --> 12:16:00.115
CITY COUNCIL LEVEL THAT THIS IS

12:16:00.182 --> 12:16:01.383
GOOD FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES AND

12:16:01.450 --> 12:16:03.319
THEY WILL HAVE TO COMPLY WITH A

12:16:03.385 --> 12:16:06.589
PAGES LONG LIST. OF PUBLIC

12:16:06.655 --> 12:16:07.623
SAFETY REQUIREMENTS PUBLIC

12:16:07.690 --> 12:16:11.093
HEARINGS I ENGAGEMENT WITH

12:16:11.160 --> 12:16:11.694
THEIR COMMUNITIES BEFORE THEY

12:16:11.760 --> 12:16:15.130
ARE ALLOWED TO JOIN. SO I THINK

12:16:15.197 --> 12:16:15.898
THAT WE ARE TAKING A BALANCED

12:16:15.965 --> 12:16:18.000
APPROACH HERE. I THINK THAT WE

12:16:18.067 --> 12:16:19.435
SHOULD LET OUR LOCAL

12:16:19.502 --> 12:16:20.469
GOVERNMENTS DO WHAT'S BEST FOR

12:16:20.536 --> 12:16:22.104
THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THEN.

12:16:22.171 --> 12:16:23.472
WHEN THIS PILOT PROGRAM IS RUN

12:16:23.539 --> 12:16:26.876
ITS COURSE. SEVERAL YEARS FROM

12:16:26.942 --> 12:16:27.343
NOW WE CAN LOOK AT THE

12:16:27.409 --> 12:16:27.977
STATISTICS AND FIND OUT WHETHER

12:16:28.043 --> 12:16:30.546
OR NOT. THIS WAS A REASONABLE

12:16:30.613 --> 12:16:32.348
POWER TO GIVE THEM. AND I

12:16:32.414 --> 12:16:33.482
SUSPECT THE ANSWER WILL BE YES

12:16:33.549 --> 12:16:35.217
BUT IF THE ANSWER IS NO. THEN

12:16:35.284 --> 12:16:36.352
WE SHOULD TERMINATE THE PILOT

12:16:36.418 --> 12:16:39.321
PROGRAM. BUT BECAUSE I'M A

12:16:39.388 --> 12:16:39.922
BELIEVER IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT I

12:16:39.989 --> 12:16:45.594

12:16:45.661 --> 12:16:49.398
I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE.

12:16:49.465 --> 12:16:52.968
THE IRONY THAT. WE HAVE. SO

12:16:53.035 --> 12:16:55.638
MANY PEOPLE FROM BOTH SIDES OF

12:16:55.704 --> 12:16:56.238
THE AISLE TALKING ABOUT LOCAL

12:16:56.305 --> 12:16:58.607
CONTROL WHEN WE VOTED ON SO

12:16:58.674 --> 12:17:01.377
MANY BILLS TODAY TO TAKE AWAY

12:17:01.443 --> 12:17:02.778
LOCAL CONTROL YOU KNOW TO BUILD

12:17:02.845 --> 12:17:04.980
MORE HOUSING AND YET HERE WE'RE

12:17:05.047 --> 12:17:06.949
TALKING ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL SO

12:17:07.016 --> 12:17:08.817
THAT WE CAN SELL GIVE OUR

12:17:08.884 --> 12:17:10.452

THOSE STATISTICS TO ME. IT

12:17:37.379 --> 12:17:39.415

ONE OF THE LARGEST SCHOOL

12:34:44.339 --> 12:34:46.007
DISTRICTS IN THE WORLD TO MAKE

12:34:46.074 --> 12:34:47.609
THIS MOVE THERE WAS A TEAM OF

12:34:47.675 --> 12:34:49.911
RESEARCHERS. THAT ELECTED TO GO

12:34:49.978 --> 12:34:51.279
IN AND DO A VERY COMPREHENSIVE

12:34:51.346 --> 12:34:52.714
STUDY AND THEY STARTED BEFORE

12:34:52.780 --> 12:34:54.215
THE CHANGE WAS MADE AND THEY

12:34:54.282 --> 12:34:56.417
WANTED DETAILED EMPIRICAL DATA

12:34:56.484 --> 12:34:57.685
SO RATHER THAN JUST ASKING

12:34:57.752 --> 12:34:58.987
PEOPLE THEIR OPINIONS THEY

12:34:59.053 --> 12:34:59.954
ACTUALLY FITTED GROUPS OF

12:35:00.021 --> 12:35:01.623
STUDENTS WITH SLEEP MONITORS.

12:35:01.689 --> 12:35:02.890

AFTER THE LOOK TO TEST SCORES

12:35:04.125 --> 12:35:05.593
BEFORE AND AFTER AND THAT DATA

12:35:05.660 --> 12:35:07.128
WAS JUST PUBLISHED A COUPLE OF

12:35:07.195 --> 12:35:08.696
MONTHS AGO. AND YOU KNOW WHAT

12:35:08.763 --> 12:35:10.498
THEY FOUND CONTRARY TO WHAT HAS

12:35:10.565 --> 12:35:11.866
BEEN STATED IN OPPOSITION HERE

12:35:11.933 --> 12:35:13.868
ON THE FLOOR THEY FOUND THAT

12:35:13.935 --> 12:35:15.536
STUDENTS DID NOT GO TO SLEEP

12:35:15.603 --> 12:35:17.438
LATER IN FACT OF THAT FIFTEEN

12:35:17.505 --> 12:35:18.172
MINUTES THEY MOVED THE START

12:35:18.239 --> 12:35:20.341
TIME BACK. THE AVERAGE HIGH

12:35:20.408 --> 12:35:22.143
SCHOOL STUDENT GOT AN EXTRA

12:35:22.210 --> 12:35:23.411
THIRTY FOUR MINUTES OF SLEEP.

12:35:23.478 --> 12:35:25.546
THEY FOUND THAT THE AVERAGE ARE

12:35:25.613 --> 12:35:27.181
GRADE FOR THOSE HIGH SCHOOL

12:35:27.248 --> 12:35:30.151
STUDENTS INCREASED BY ALMOST 5%

12:35:30.218 --> 12:35:31.052
TO PUT THAT IN CONTEXT THAT'S

12:35:31.119 --> 12:35:33.388
ALMOST HALF THE AGREED THAT

12:35:33.454 --> 12:35:35.023
THEY THEY INCREASED ON AVERAGE.

12:35:35.089 --> 12:35:36.524
THEY HAD SUBSTANTIALLY LESS

12:35:36.591 --> 12:35:38.259
TARDY'S SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED

12:35:38.326 --> 12:35:42.497
ABSENTEEISM. THOSE ARE POWERFUL

12:35:42.563 --> 12:35:46.901
RESEARCH RESULTS. AND THEY'RE

12:35:46.968 --> 12:35:47.502
VERY APPLICABLE TO WHAT WE'RE

12:35:47.568 --> 12:35:48.102
THINKING ABOUT DOING TODAY NOW

12:35:48.169 --> 12:35:48.670
I HAVE HEARD. THE ARGUMENTS

12:35:48.736 --> 12:35:49.303
AGAINST THIS BELIEVE ME I'VE

12:35:49.370 --> 12:35:50.438
HEARD IT BECAUSE I THINK I'VE

12:35:50.505 --> 12:35:51.305
GOT SOME SCHOOL DISTRICT

12:35:51.372 --> 12:35:52.306
SUPERINTENDENTS THAT ARE GONNA

12:35:52.373 --> 12:35:54.308
BURN BE AN EFFIGY. IF THE

12:35:54.375 --> 12:35:54.909
GOVERNOR SIGNS THIS BILL THIS

12:35:54.976 --> 12:35:57.712
YEAR. AND SOME OF THEM HAVE

12:35:57.779 --> 12:35:59.147
VERY FIRST OF ALL I'VE HEARD. A

12:35:59.213 --> 12:36:00.782
PARENT CONVENIENCE. WELL TELL

12:36:00.848 --> 12:36:02.517

IN THE MORNING SO IT'S NOT

12:36:05.319 --> 12:36:06.287
TERRIBLY CONVENIENT FOR MY

12:36:06.354 --> 12:36:08.289
PARENTS. BUT IT DEPENDS ON HOW

12:36:08.356 --> 12:36:08.823
FAR YOU'RE DRIVING I THINK

12:36:08.890 --> 12:36:10.925
THAT'S KIND OF A WASH.

12:36:10.992 --> 12:36:12.260

RESPECT TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM

12:39:33.127 --> 12:39:34.795
TORRANCE THE OPPOSITION THIS

YEAR HAS COME UP WITH A LETTER

12:39:36.097 --> 12:39:37.865
FROM ONE RESEARCHER OPPOSING

12:39:37.932 --> 12:39:39.767
THIS BILL BUT THERE IS VIRTUAL

12:39:39.834 --> 12:39:41.502
UNANIMITY IF YOU LOOK AT THE

12:39:41.569 --> 12:39:42.703
AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS

12:39:42.770 --> 12:39:43.537
IF YOU LOOK AT THE AMERICAN

12:39:43.604 --> 12:39:45.706
MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IF YOU LOOK

12:39:45.773 --> 12:39:46.307
AT ALL OF THE SCIENCE IN THE

12:39:46.374 --> 12:39:47.375
RESEARCH AND THE PEOPLE WHO

12:39:47.441 --> 12:39:48.542
HAVE LOOKED INTO THIS. THEY

12:39:48.609 --> 12:39:50.778
TELL US ONE VERY SIMPLE FACT

12:39:50.845 --> 12:39:52.113
THAT MAKING THIS CHANGE WILL

12:39:52.179 --> 12:39:54.215
SAVE LIVES IT WILL SAVE LIVES

12:39:54.282 --> 12:39:56.050
IN AVOIDED SUICIDES IT WILL

12:39:56.117 --> 12:39:57.084
SAVE LIVES IN AVOIDED CAR

12:39:57.151 --> 12:39:59.453
CRASHES THIS IS IN A MEASURE

12:39:59.520 --> 12:40:01.222
THAT WE CAN TAKE THAT WILL HELP

12:40:01.289 --> 12:40:02.957
SAVE LIVES I KNOW THAT THERE

12:40:03.024 --> 12:40:04.692
ARE LOTS OF REASONS NOT TO DO

12:40:04.759 --> 12:40:06.727
THIS THE INCONVENIENCE FOR SOME

12:40:06.794 --> 12:40:08.195
FOLKS THE FACT THAT THERE ARE A

12:40:08.262 --> 12:40:09.096
LOT OF PEOPLE THAT MIGHT BE PUT

12:40:09.163 --> 12:40:11.332
OUT. BUT DO MAKING THIS CHANGE

12:40:11.399 --> 12:40:13.100
IS A REALLY POWERFUL WAY FOR US

12:40:13.167 --> 12:40:15.303
TO SAVE LIVES AND I WOULD

12:40:15.369 --> 12:40:15.903
COURAGE ALL OF YOU TO. VOTE I

12:40:15.970 --> 12:40:22.843
ON THIS MEASURE. MR KILEY.

12:40:22.910 --> 12:40:24.378
THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I

12:40:24.445 --> 12:40:26.113
WOULD ANY BELL WE HAVE TO ASK

12:40:26.180 --> 12:40:27.481
WHETHER IT'S THE RIGHT POLICY

12:40:27.548 --> 12:40:29.150
AND WHETHER WERE THE RIGHT

12:40:29.216 --> 12:40:29.750
INSTITUTION. TO BE MAKING THE

12:40:29.817 --> 12:40:32.920
POLICY. ON THE FIRST QUESTION

12:40:32.987 --> 12:40:35.456
AS OTHERS HAVE MENTIONED. THE

12:40:35.523 --> 12:40:36.891
OVERWHELMING WEIGHT OF THE

12:40:36.958 --> 12:40:38.225
EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT WHILE

12:40:38.292 --> 12:40:39.794
SCHOOL START TIMES ARE NOT A

12:40:39.860 --> 12:40:40.995
PANACEA FOR OUR PUBLIC

12:40:41.062 --> 12:40:47.868
EDUCATION SYSTEM. THEY DO LEAD.

12:40:47.935 --> 12:40:51.305
MORE THAN MARGINAL. THEN

12:40:51.372 --> 12:40:51.839
THERE'S THE INSTITUTIONAL

12:40:51.906 --> 12:40:55.009
QUESTION AND MY OWN PHILOSOPHY

12:40:55.076 --> 12:40:56.744
IS THAT DECISION MAKING PUBLIC

12:40:56.811 --> 12:40:58.879
POLICY SHOULD BE MADE AT THE

12:40:58.946 --> 12:41:00.414
MOST LOCAL LEVEL PRACTICABLE

12:41:00.481 --> 12:41:01.215
WHERE THE DIFFERENT

12:41:01.282 --> 12:41:02.883
CIRCUMSTANCES AND VALUES OF

12:41:02.950 --> 12:41:04.552
COMMUNITIES CAN BE ACCOUNTED

12:41:04.618 --> 12:41:06.120
FOR WE'RE DECISION MAKERS ARE

12:41:06.187 --> 12:41:07.455
CLOSEST TO THE PEOPLE WHO WILL

12:41:07.521 --> 12:41:09.557
BE IMPACTED WERE FLEXIBILITY

12:41:09.623 --> 12:41:11.659
ALLOWS FOR INNOVATION AND FOR

12:41:11.726 --> 12:41:12.960
IMPROVEMENT THROUGH TRIAL AND

12:41:13.027 --> 12:41:14.528
ERROR AND WE SHOULD REFRAIN

12:41:14.595 --> 12:41:17.064
FROM TAKING ACTION ON THE CROSS

12:41:17.131 --> 12:41:19.133
JURISDICTIONAL OR STATE LEVEL

12:41:19.200 --> 12:41:20.601
IN LAST THERE'S A COMPELLING.

12:41:20.668 --> 12:41:23.170
BASIS FOR DOING SO THAT'S WHY I

12:41:23.237 --> 12:41:25.673
DID NOT SUPPORT PRIOR VERSIONS

12:41:25.740 --> 12:41:29.777
OF THIS BILL. BUT I REACHED A

12:41:29.844 --> 12:41:30.378
DIFFERENT CONCLUSION WITH THE

12:41:30.444 --> 12:41:32.747
BILL THAT'S BEFORE US TODAY.

12:41:32.813 --> 12:41:34.782
FOR ONE THING THIS BILL IS HAS

12:41:34.849 --> 12:41:37.718
BEEN AMENDED IN WAYS THAT ADDS

12:41:37.785 --> 12:41:39.720
A GREATER LEVEL OF FLEXIBILITY

12:41:39.787 --> 12:41:41.489
AND GET CLOSER TO STRIKING THE

12:41:41.555 --> 12:41:43.124
RIGHT BALANCE AND THE AUTHOR IS

12:41:43.190 --> 12:41:44.859
COMMITTED TO WORKING IN THE

12:41:44.925 --> 12:41:46.360
YEARS BETWEEN PASSAGE AN

12:41:46.427 --> 12:41:49.497
IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED TO IT

12:41:49.563 --> 12:41:50.031
AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

12:41:50.097 --> 12:41:50.664
BALANCE. IS STRUCK IN THE RIGHT

12:41:50.731 --> 12:41:54.001
WAY. BUT MORE THAN THAT THERE

12:41:54.068 --> 12:41:55.136
HAS IN MY VIEW A MERGED A

12:41:55.202 --> 12:41:56.570
COMPELLING BASIS FOR STATE

12:41:56.637 --> 12:41:57.772
ACTION AND THAT IS THE

12:41:57.838 --> 12:41:59.507
DIFFICULTY. THAT THE BARRIERS

12:41:59.573 --> 12:42:01.675
THAT EXIST DID DISTRICTS THAT

12:42:01.742 --> 12:42:02.810
ACTUALLY DO WANT TO CHANGE

12:42:02.877 --> 12:42:04.745
THEIR START TIMES. BECAUSE WE

12:42:04.812 --> 12:42:06.213
HAVE A STATE WITH A THOUSAND

12:42:06.280 --> 12:42:07.848
SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHERE YOU CAN

12:42:07.915 --> 12:42:09.250
HAVE DOZENS OF DISTRICTS WITHIN

12:42:09.316 --> 12:42:11.052
A GIVEN REGION AND THEY ARE

12:42:11.118 --> 12:42:13.354
GOVERNED INDEPENDENTLY BUT- THE

12:42:13.421 --> 12:42:14.588
AFFAIRS OF THESE DISTRICTS ARE

12:42:14.655 --> 12:42:16.123
INTERTWINED WITH THINGS LIKE

12:42:16.190 --> 12:42:17.491
TRANSPORTATION. AND

12:42:17.558 --> 12:42:18.893
EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES AND

12:42:18.959 --> 12:42:21.028
SO FORTH AND SO THERE IS IT'S

12:42:21.095 --> 12:42:22.563
VERY IMPORTANT THAT THEIR

12:42:22.630 --> 12:42:25.666
SCHEDULES ARE GENERALLY ALIGNED

12:42:25.733 --> 12:42:26.267
AND IF YOU HAVE A PARTICULAR

12:42:26.333 --> 12:42:28.269
DISTRICT THAT WANTS TO CHANGE

12:42:28.335 --> 12:42:30.504
IT START TIME THAT MY THROAT SO

12:42:30.571 --> 12:42:31.405
I TO SYNC WITH SCHOOLS IN THE

12:42:31.472 --> 12:42:33.074
SURROUNDING AREA. THE BECOMES

12:42:33.140 --> 12:42:35.643
DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO DO SO AND

12:42:35.709 --> 12:42:37.778
I'VE HEARD FROM DISTRICTS THAT

12:42:37.845 --> 12:42:39.113
FACE THIS VERY DONNA. SO THE

12:42:39.180 --> 12:42:40.614
TENDENCY IS FOR THE TIMES IN A

12:42:40.681 --> 12:42:43.150
GIVEN REGION TO BE COORDINATED

12:42:43.217 --> 12:42:43.584
IN THE MOST NATURAL

12:42:43.651 --> 12:42:45.086
COORDINATION POINT IS THE

12:42:45.152 --> 12:42:46.954
STATUS QUO. SO I HAVE YOU THIS

12:42:47.021 --> 12:42:48.789
BILL AS PROVIDING A NEW

12:42:48.856 --> 12:42:50.424
COORDINATION POINT THAT IS

12:42:50.491 --> 12:42:52.626
BASED UPON RESEARCH AND BASED

12:42:52.693 --> 12:42:54.962
UPON SCIENCE AND I ACKNOWLEDGE

12:42:55.029 --> 12:42:56.730
THAT THERE WILL BE SOME

12:42:56.797 --> 12:42:57.331
DISTRICTS THAT HAVE CAREFULLY

12:42:57.398 --> 12:42:58.365
THOUGHT THROUGH THE ISSUE OF

12:42:58.432 --> 12:43:00.534
START TIMES. THERE WILL HAVE TO

12:43:00.601 --> 12:43:01.969
MAKE CHANGES AND THAT WEIGHS

12:43:02.036 --> 12:43:04.872
HEAVILY ON MY OWN THINKING. BUT

12:43:04.939 --> 12:43:05.973
AT THE SAME TIME THERE ARE

12:43:06.040 --> 12:43:06.941
DISTRICTS THAT WILL BE

12:43:07.007 --> 12:43:08.909
EMPOWERED TO MAKE THE SORT OF

12:43:08.976 --> 12:43:10.945
CHANGES THEY WOULD LIKE TO MAKE

12:43:11.011 --> 12:43:11.679
TO BETTER REFLECT THE

12:43:11.745 --> 12:43:13.714
PREDICAMENT AND THE DESIRES AND

12:43:13.781 --> 12:43:14.949
THE INTEREST OF THEIR

12:43:15.015 --> 12:43:18.385
COMMUNITIES SO IN OTHER WORDS.

12:43:18.452 --> 12:43:19.019
THE LOCAL CONTROL ARGUMENT CUTS

12:43:19.086 --> 12:43:26.060
BOTH WAYS. AND AT THAT POINT I

12:43:26.127 --> 12:43:27.394
THINK WE CAN DEFER TO THE

12:43:27.461 --> 12:43:28.162
EVIDENCE THAT OVERWHELMINGLY

12:43:28.229 --> 12:43:29.964
SHOWS. THAT THIS WILL BE IN THE

12:43:30.030 --> 12:43:31.799
BEST INTERESTS OF CALIFORNIA'S

12:43:31.866 --> 12:43:33.734
KIDS I ASKED FOR A VOTE. MISS

12:43:33.801 --> 12:43:37.471
SMITH. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER

12:43:37.538 --> 12:43:39.840
COLLEAGUES I RISE AS AN

12:43:39.907 --> 12:43:40.441
IMMEDIATE FORMER SCHOOL BOARD

12:43:40.508 --> 12:43:43.043
MEMBER. AND SOMEONE WHO

12:43:43.110 --> 12:43:44.645
REPRESENTS A DISTRICT WHERE NOT

12:43:44.712 --> 12:43:46.413
A SINGLE ONE OF MY LOCAL

12:43:46.480 --> 12:43:47.982
DISTRICT CAN FIND THEMSELVES IN

12:43:48.048 --> 12:43:49.483
SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. AND

12:43:49.550 --> 12:43:53.654
IT'S NOT SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY

12:43:53.721 --> 12:43:57.424
FAVOR LOCAL CONTROL BUT A LOT

12:43:57.491 --> 12:43:58.492
OF IT HAS TO DO WITH THE

12:43:58.559 --> 12:44:01.495
PRACTICABILITY OF SCHEDULING IN

12:44:01.562 --> 12:44:03.130
OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY AND

12:44:03.197 --> 12:44:05.599
SCHEDULING. ON A SCHOOL SITE.

12:44:05.666 --> 12:44:08.102
WE STILL ARE REMINDED THIS BODY

12:44:08.169 --> 12:44:10.571
REMAINS ONE OF THE LOWEST

12:44:10.638 --> 12:44:12.673
FUNDED STATES IN PER PUPIL

12:44:12.740 --> 12:44:15.509
SPENDING ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

12:44:15.576 --> 12:44:17.478
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS

12:44:17.545 --> 12:44:20.414
MEASURE WILL COST MONEY IT IS

12:44:20.481 --> 12:44:23.083
QUITE SIMPLY IT WELL INTO OUR

12:44:23.150 --> 12:44:25.019
COLLEAGUE FROM BIG BEAR WHOSE

12:44:25.085 --> 12:44:27.321
SON WAS ABLE TO TAKE AN A. P.

12:44:27.388 --> 12:44:28.956
COURSE VERY EARLY IN THE

12:44:29.023 --> 12:44:31.125
MORNING. VERY OFTEN THAT'S

12:44:31.192 --> 12:44:31.959
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT SCHOOL

12:44:32.026 --> 12:44:34.195
DISTRICTS FACE A CHALLENGE OF

12:44:34.261 --> 12:44:35.529
MATCHING THE NEEDS OF THEIR

12:44:35.596 --> 12:44:37.031
STUDENT POPULATION WITH THE

12:44:37.097 --> 12:44:38.365
FACILITIES AND THE

12:44:38.432 --> 12:44:39.633
INSTRUCTIONAL TIME THEY HAVE

12:44:39.700 --> 12:44:42.469
AVAILABLE. SO FOR MANY MANY

12:44:42.536 --> 12:44:44.838
KIDS MY OWN INCLUDED THERE

12:44:44.905 --> 12:44:46.106
OPPORTUNITY PART OF HER

12:44:46.173 --> 12:44:47.308
DISSIPATE IN BOTH ADVANCED

12:44:47.374 --> 12:44:48.175
PROGRAMMING AND IN SOME

12:44:48.242 --> 12:44:49.843
CHILDREN'S CASES REMEDIATION

12:44:49.910 --> 12:44:51.512
PROGRAMMING DEPENDED ON A

12:44:51.579 --> 12:44:53.447
SCHEDULE THAT WAS FLEXIBLE

12:44:53.514 --> 12:44:55.849
THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL DAY. AND

12:44:55.916 --> 12:44:58.052
YES THE EVIDENCE IS COMPELLING

12:44:58.118 --> 12:44:58.619
AND I HAVE SHARED WITH THE

12:44:58.686 --> 12:44:59.920
AUTHOR THAT I DO BELIEVE IT'S

12:44:59.987 --> 12:45:02.356
COMPELLING I DON'T YET BELIEVE

12:45:02.423 --> 12:45:03.857
IT IS COMPELLING ENOUGH FOR US

12:45:03.924 --> 12:45:05.993
TO COMPLETELY OVERRIDE ALL OF

12:45:06.060 --> 12:45:08.062
THE LOCAL PRACTICAL CONCERNS

12:45:08.128 --> 12:45:09.530
ASSOCIATED AN AFFILIATED WITH

12:45:09.597 --> 12:45:11.498
THIS BILL. BECAUSE AMONG MY

12:45:11.565 --> 12:45:12.866
SCHOOL DISTRICT TO HAVE THESE

12:45:12.933 --> 12:45:14.735
SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS EVERY

12:45:14.802 --> 12:45:16.537
SINGLE ONE OF THEM ALSO IS

12:45:16.604 --> 12:45:17.805
IMPLEMENTING STUDENT MENTAL

12:45:17.871 --> 12:45:19.240
HEALTH AND WELLNESS PROGRAMMING

12:45:19.306 --> 12:45:21.575
NEXT YEAR IN ORDER TO ALSO

12:45:21.642 --> 12:45:23.611
ADDRESS THOSE VERY KEY AND

12:45:23.677 --> 12:45:26.013
CRITICAL STUDENT NEEDS. I JUST

12:45:26.080 --> 12:45:28.282
URGE THAT WE EXT EXERCISE

12:45:28.349 --> 12:45:30.217
EXTREME CAUTION HERE AND TO

12:45:30.284 --> 12:45:32.119
ALLOW OUR LOCAL DISTRICTS TO DO

12:45:32.186 --> 12:45:33.621
WHAT'S BEST IN OUR COMMUNITY

12:45:33.687 --> 12:45:34.255
INTO THE POINTS OF MANY OF MY

12:45:34.321 --> 12:45:35.656
COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE RISEN AND

12:45:35.723 --> 12:45:37.458
SUPPORT. YOUR LOCAL DISTRICT

12:45:37.524 --> 12:45:38.859
MAY FIND ITSELF IN SUPPORT AND

12:45:38.926 --> 12:45:40.894
FIND THAT THIS IS THE BEST WAY

12:45:40.961 --> 12:45:43.030
FOR THEM TO GO AND WE SHOULD

12:45:43.097 --> 12:45:43.831
SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGE THAT

12:45:43.897 --> 12:45:45.899
ALONG WITH THE PARENT COMMUNITY

12:45:45.966 --> 12:45:46.767
BEING INVOLVED IN THAT

12:45:46.834 --> 12:45:49.503
STAKEHOLDER PROCESS BUT FOR US

12:45:49.570 --> 12:45:50.671
TO MAKE A SWEEPING DECISION

12:45:50.738 --> 12:45:52.773
LIKE THIS HERE IN SACRAMENTO

12:45:52.840 --> 12:45:55.242
WHEN IT REALLY HAS. SOME VERY

12:45:55.309 --> 12:46:00.581
DETAILED PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS.

12:46:00.648 --> 12:46:01.215
FOR OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT I DON'T

12:46:01.282 --> 12:46:01.782
THINK IT'S THE RIGHT VOTE TO

12:46:01.849 --> 12:46:12.326
TAKE. MISTER CALDERON. YOU ARE

12:46:12.393 --> 12:46:12.960
RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISS MEGAN

12:46:13.027 --> 12:46:14.361
MEMBERS I AM PROUD TO RISE IN

12:46:14.428 --> 12:46:15.829
SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE I

12:46:15.896 --> 12:46:16.697
REPRESENT. THE CITY OF LOVE

12:46:16.764 --> 12:46:17.264
POINT THEY IT IS THE POOREST

12:46:17.331 --> 12:46:17.865
COMMUNITY IN THE SAN GABRIEL

12:46:17.931 --> 12:46:19.199
VALLEY AND ONE OF THE SCHOOLS

12:46:19.266 --> 12:46:19.767
IN MY DISTRICT ACTUALLY MOVE

12:46:19.833 --> 12:46:20.934
THEIR START TIME. AN HOUR LATER

12:46:21.001 --> 12:46:21.769
THIS IS A SCHOOL WHERE THEY HAD

12:46:21.835 --> 12:46:23.070
TRUANCY THAT WAS REALLY BAD

12:46:23.137 --> 12:46:23.837
THEY HAVE POOR ACADEMIC

12:46:23.904 --> 12:46:25.005
PERFORMANCE AND THEY HAD A LOT

12:46:25.072 --> 12:46:26.373
OF DISCIPLINARY ISSUES. BY

12:46:26.440 --> 12:46:29.076
MOVING THAT START TIME AN HOUR

12:46:29.143 --> 12:46:31.412
LATER TRUANCY CAN SIGNIFICANTLY

12:46:31.478 --> 12:46:33.147
DECREASE DISCIPLINARY ACTION

12:46:33.213 --> 12:46:34.715
SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED AND

12:46:34.782 --> 12:46:36.150
ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE

12:46:36.216 --> 12:46:38.419
SIGNIFICANTLY. INCREASED I

12:46:38.485 --> 12:46:39.720
SUPPORT DOES NOT JUST BECAUSE

12:46:39.787 --> 12:46:42.823
OF THE DATA AND ALL OF THE

12:46:42.890 --> 12:46:44.425
IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR

12:46:44.491 --> 12:46:45.559
KIDS. BUT I SUPPORT IT BECAUSE

12:46:45.626 --> 12:46:47.928
I'VE SEEN IT IN ACTION AND KNOW

12:46:47.995 --> 12:46:50.931
THAT IT ACTUALLY WORKS AND I

12:46:50.998 --> 12:46:56.070
WILL SAY. THAT MY BIGGEST. PET

12:46:56.136 --> 12:46:57.137
PEEVE OF DEALING WITH THIS

12:46:57.204 --> 12:46:58.405
ISSUE HAS EVERY TIME THAT I'VE

12:46:58.472 --> 12:46:59.239
BEEN APPROACHED BY THE

12:46:59.306 --> 12:47:00.107
OPPOSITION TO TALK TO ABOUT

12:47:00.174 --> 12:47:02.276
THIS ISSUE. IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT

12:47:02.343 --> 12:47:03.577
HOW IT'S GOING TO IMPACT THE

12:47:03.644 --> 12:47:05.245
ADULT'S LIFE. HOW IT'S GOING TO

12:47:05.312 --> 12:47:07.848
IMPACT THE MEMBERS OF THE

12:47:07.915 --> 12:47:08.882
SCHOOL BOARD WHO ARE GOING TO

12:47:08.949 --> 12:47:10.617
HAVE TO RESCHEDULE BUS TIMES

12:47:10.684 --> 12:47:12.886
RESCHEDULE SCHOOL START TIMES

12:47:12.953 --> 12:47:14.421
AND- EVERYTHING ELSE THE

12:47:14.488 --> 12:47:16.590
PARENTS. EVERYTHING ELSE THAT'S

12:47:16.657 --> 12:47:17.157
GOING TO IMPACT THE LIVES OF

12:47:17.224 --> 12:47:21.829
THE ADULTS. SO EASILY WE THEN

12:47:21.895 --> 12:47:23.397
THROW ASIDE WHAT IS CLEARLY THE

12:47:23.464 --> 12:47:24.898
RIGHT MOVE WHICH IS THIS IS THE

12:47:24.965 --> 12:47:27.000
RIGHT THING FOR KIDS I THINK

12:47:27.067 --> 12:47:28.335
THAT THAT IS INCORRECT I DON'T

12:47:28.402 --> 12:47:29.536
THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT WE

12:47:29.603 --> 12:47:31.238
SHOULD. DO IN TERMS OF POLICY

12:47:31.305 --> 12:47:33.607
BECAUSE WE KNOW BECAUSE OF THE

12:47:33.674 --> 12:47:34.575
EVIDENCE AND THAT ALL OF THE

12:47:34.641 --> 12:47:35.509
STUDIES IN THE DATA POINT TO

12:47:35.576 --> 12:47:37.077
THIS BEING THE RIGHT THING. I

12:47:37.144 --> 12:47:38.145
DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE

12:47:38.212 --> 12:47:39.513
MAKING THIS DECISION BASED ON

12:47:39.580 --> 12:47:41.415
HOW THIS IS GOING TO IMPACT

12:47:41.482 --> 12:47:43.884
ADULTS LIVES MY KID. CHARLIE

12:47:43.951 --> 12:47:44.651
SHE'S GONNA START PRESCHOOL

12:47:44.718 --> 12:47:47.521
VERY SOON. AND I KNOW THAT MY

12:47:47.588 --> 12:47:48.956
WIFE AND I WOULD DO ANYTHING TO

12:47:49.022 --> 12:47:51.058
MAKE IT WORK REGARDLESS OF THE

12:47:51.125 --> 12:47:52.526
TIME THAT SHE'S GOING TO BE

12:47:52.593 --> 12:47:53.060
STARTING SCHOOL AND I KNOW

12:47:53.127 --> 12:47:56.230
THAT. SURFING WAS BROUGHT UP AS

12:47:56.296 --> 12:47:58.465
EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITY THAT

12:47:58.532 --> 12:47:59.333
SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE GONNA BE

12:47:59.400 --> 12:48:00.634
ABLE THE IMPLEMENTERS OR

12:48:00.701 --> 12:48:01.568
SCHOOLS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO

12:48:01.635 --> 12:48:02.803
DO WHAT YOU GO EARLY IN THE

12:48:02.870 --> 12:48:04.037
MORNING ANYWAY SO QUITE

12:48:04.104 --> 12:48:04.938
HONESTLY THEY'RE GONNA HAVE

12:48:05.005 --> 12:48:05.739
MORE TIME TO SURF. AND I THINK

12:48:05.806 --> 12:48:07.941
THAT'S A GREAT THING TO SELL I

12:48:08.008 --> 12:48:11.945
WILL SAY THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT

12:48:12.012 --> 12:48:12.546

12:48:38.872 --> 12:48:39.406
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. NOW HERE WE

12:48:39.473 --> 12:48:45.813

DISTRICTS THEY'LL TALK ABOUT

12:49:01.829 --> 12:49:03.263
IMPLEMENTATION THERE IS

12:49:03.330 --> 12:49:04.798
DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT THIS WILL

12:49:04.865 --> 12:49:07.100
COST BUT I ASK EVERY SINGLE ONE

12:49:07.167 --> 12:49:08.702

IN THIS DEBATE IS ABSOLUTELY

12:49:16.276 --> 12:49:21.682
CLEAR. DATA SPANNING DECADES

NOT JUST A YEAR NOT JUST ONE

12:49:23.684 --> 12:49:24.618
LITTLE FLIMSY STUDY NOT A

CONTEMPLATE SUICIDE THEY'RE

12:49:38.899 --> 12:49:40.367
LESS LIKELY TO GET IN CAR

12:49:40.434 --> 12:49:41.902
ACCIDENTS THERE TENANTS GO UP.

12:49:41.969 --> 12:49:43.670
THEIR GRADES GO UP THEIR

12:49:48.008 --> 12:49:49.543
BRAINER BUT I KNOW FOR MANY OF

12:49:49.610 --> 12:49:51.011

AND THIS IS BEEN A VERY

13:31:53.164 --> 13:31:55.199
DIFFICULT SITUATION

13:31:55.266 --> 13:31:58.169

COMPLEXITIES AND THE CONFUSION

13:32:01.039 --> 13:32:03.274
SURROUNDING THE BILL. SOME OF

YOU MAY HAVE SEEN ON ON YOUR

13:32:04.642 --> 13:32:06.477
DESK FOR MY DESK THAT THERE

13:32:06.544 --> 13:32:07.445
WOULD NUMBER OF BLACK

13:32:07.512 --> 13:32:10.081
NEWSPAPERS OPPOSED TO THIS AND

13:32:10.148 --> 13:32:11.516
THAT THEY IN DOUBLE ACP AND

13:32:11.582 --> 13:32:12.984
OTHERS HAVE TAKEN POSITIONS

13:32:13.051 --> 13:32:16.087
AGAINST AB FIVE. I WAS UNDER

13:32:16.154 --> 13:32:17.388
THE IMPRESSION IT THAT THERE

13:32:17.455 --> 13:32:18.890
HAD BEEN AN AGREEMENT REACHED

13:32:18.956 --> 13:32:20.224
AS A RESULT OF THAT THOSE

13:32:20.291 --> 13:32:22.393
ORGANIZATIONS PULL BACK THEIR

13:32:22.460 --> 13:32:24.495
OPPOSITION TO AB FIVE BASED ON

13:32:24.562 --> 13:32:26.531
THE FACT THAT AB ONE SEVENTY

13:32:26.597 --> 13:32:27.899
WAS GOING TO BE THERE FOR THEM

13:32:27.965 --> 13:32:29.167
TO GIVE THEM A ONE YEAR

13:32:29.233 --> 13:32:31.436
REPRIEVE TO GET ORGANIZED IT IS

13:32:31.502 --> 13:32:33.037
IMPORTANT THAT WE LIVE UP TO

13:32:33.104 --> 13:32:33.838
THE AGREEMENTS THAT WE MAKE

13:32:33.905 --> 13:32:35.473
WITH INDIVIDUALS I THINK THAT

13:32:35.540 --> 13:32:36.974
IS VERY IMPORTANT. I'VE LEARNED

13:32:37.041 --> 13:32:38.342
THAT AT THE ON THIS HOUSE ANY

13:32:38.409 --> 13:32:39.977
TIME I'VE HAD A BILL WE JUST

13:32:40.044 --> 13:32:41.913
DID THAT WITH THREE NINE TWO

13:32:41.979 --> 13:32:42.847
WHEN YOU MAKE A DEAL AND YOU

13:32:42.914 --> 13:32:43.514
MAKE AN AGREEMENT YOU'RE

13:32:43.581 --> 13:32:44.849
SUPPOSE YOU SHOULD LIVE UP TO

13:32:44.916 --> 13:32:46.851
IT AND I THINK THAT THE BLACK

13:32:46.918 --> 13:32:48.152
PRESS HAS CALLED ME SEVERAL

13:32:48.219 --> 13:32:49.987
TIMES A DAY TO MAKE SURE. THAT

13:32:50.054 --> 13:32:51.923
AB ONE SEVENTY WAS COMING TO

13:32:51.989 --> 13:32:53.191
THE FLOOR I THOUGHT EVERYTHING

13:32:53.257 --> 13:32:55.093
WAS FINE I DID NOT KNOW THAT

13:32:55.159 --> 13:32:56.527
THE THAT THE AUTHOR ROBERT WAS

13:32:56.594 --> 13:32:58.262
NOT IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL

13:32:58.329 --> 13:32:59.330
BECAUSE I WAS ON THE IMPRESSION

13:32:59.397 --> 13:33:00.565
THAT THAT AGREEMENT HAD BEEN

13:33:00.631 --> 13:33:02.633
MADE AND THAT IT WASN'T A

13:33:02.700 --> 13:33:03.768
PERFECT BILL BUT MANY OF YOU

13:33:03.835 --> 13:33:06.070
HAD ISSUES WITH THE BILL. AB

13:33:06.137 --> 13:33:07.305
FIVE AND SOLD UNDERSTANDING WAS

13:33:07.371 --> 13:33:08.372
THAT THERE WAS SOME AGREEMENT

13:33:08.439 --> 13:33:09.440
SO WILL COMING FORTH

13:33:09.507 --> 13:33:10.274
PARTICULARLY FOR THIS

13:33:10.341 --> 13:33:12.643
PARTICULAR ISSUE SO I STRONGLY

13:33:12.710 --> 13:33:14.312
SUGGESTED WE LIVE UP TO THE

13:33:14.378 --> 13:33:15.847
AGREEMENT THAT WAS REACHED

13:33:15.913 --> 13:33:17.582
OBVIOUSLY WITH THE PRESS FOR A.

13:33:17.648 --> 13:33:20.351
B. R. ONE SEVENTY IT'S A ONE

13:33:20.418 --> 13:33:22.053
YEAR EXTENSION IT'S NOT PERFECT

13:33:22.120 --> 13:33:24.622
GOD. I WAS NOT I WAS CONCERNED

13:33:24.689 --> 13:33:25.790
WITH THE PRESS BASICALLY

13:33:25.857 --> 13:33:27.058
RAISING A NUMBER OF ISSUES

13:33:27.125 --> 13:33:28.259
BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK ALL

13:33:28.326 --> 13:33:29.660
THOSE ISSUES WE'RE GOING TO BE

13:33:29.727 --> 13:33:30.328
TRUE IN TERMS OF THE

13:33:30.394 --> 13:33:32.396
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BILL SO

13:33:32.463 --> 13:33:33.965
BUT BECAUSE THE AGREEMENT WAS

13:33:34.031 --> 13:33:35.800
MADE I WAS GOING TO BOTH AB

13:33:35.867 --> 13:33:37.068
FIVE ANYWAY. BUT BECAUSE THE

13:33:37.135 --> 13:33:38.903
AGREEMENT WAS MADE THAT THEY

13:33:38.970 --> 13:33:40.905
WOULD BE PROTECTED FOR ONE YEAR

13:33:40.972 --> 13:33:41.873
UNTIL THEY WORKED OUT THIS

13:33:41.939 --> 13:33:45.977
ISSUE I THOUGHT OKAY FINE THEN

13:33:46.043 --> 13:33:46.577
THEY WHAT THEY PULL BACK THEIR

13:33:46.644 --> 13:33:50.548
OPPOSITION. SEVERAL OF YOU

13:33:50.615 --> 13:33:51.482
ASKED ME ABOUT WHAT ABOUT THE

13:33:51.549 --> 13:33:52.250
IN DOUBLE ACP AND I SAID I

13:33:52.316 --> 13:33:52.817
THINK THAT HAS BEEN PULLED

13:33:52.884 --> 13:33:53.451
BACK. THE BLACK PRESS IS PULL

13:33:53.518 --> 13:33:54.018
BACK THEIR OPPOSITION AND I

13:33:54.085 --> 13:33:54.552
RECOMMEND IT TO SEVERAL

13:33:54.619 --> 13:33:55.987
INDIVIDUALS THAT THEY BOTH AB

13:33:56.053 --> 13:33:58.089
FIVE. SO I THINK AT THIS POINT

13:33:58.156 --> 13:33:59.457
AB ONE SEVENTY IS THE LEAST

13:33:59.524 --> 13:34:01.058
THAT WE CAN DO WITH A ONE YEAR

13:34:01.125 --> 13:34:02.360
EXTENSION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

13:34:02.426 --> 13:34:04.028
LIVE UP TO THE AGREEMENT. THAT

13:34:04.095 --> 13:34:05.630
THAT PRESS THINKS THAT WE MADE

13:34:05.696 --> 13:34:07.165
TO THEM. AND I'VE HAD AS A SAID

13:34:07.231 --> 13:34:08.399
SEVERAL CALLS FROM THE

13:34:08.466 --> 13:34:09.667
PRESIDENT OF THE BLACK PRESS

13:34:09.734 --> 13:34:10.735
AND A HOST OF OTHERS UP AND

13:34:10.801 --> 13:34:13.004
DOWN THE STATE. CONCERNING AB

13:34:13.070 --> 13:34:14.138
FIVE IN THEIR PERCEPTION OF HOW

13:34:14.205 --> 13:34:15.173
IT WAS GOING TO HAVE A NEGATIVE

13:34:15.239 --> 13:34:16.974
IMPACT ON THEM. AND THE ONE

13:34:17.041 --> 13:34:18.342
YEAR EXTENSION WOULD PROVIDE

13:34:18.409 --> 13:34:19.610
THEM WITH THE ABILITY. TO

13:34:19.677 --> 13:34:20.878
ADJUST BECAUSE MANY OF THEM

13:34:20.945 --> 13:34:21.846
BELIEVE IN MAYBE AND THE

13:34:21.913 --> 13:34:23.247
PROBLEM IS NOT TRUE. BUT IF

13:34:23.314 --> 13:34:25.283
THEY DO THAT IF. THE WAY AB

13:34:25.349 --> 13:34:26.951
FIVE WAS PUT IN PLACE. THEY

13:34:27.018 --> 13:34:27.685
WOULD HAVE TO GO OUT OF

13:34:27.752 --> 13:34:29.320
BUSINESS BECAUSE IT WAS SMALL.

13:34:29.387 --> 13:34:31.022
NEWSPAPERS RUN BY JUST

13:34:31.088 --> 13:34:32.557
SOMETIMES THEIR FAMILIES AND IT

13:34:32.623 --> 13:34:33.991
WAS A LOT OF. COMPLICATED

13:34:34.058 --> 13:34:36.027
ISSUES ABOUT THE COURIERS AND

13:34:36.093 --> 13:34:37.395
THIS AND THAT. AND THIS GAVE

13:34:37.461 --> 13:34:38.629

MATE. AND THEY HAVE AN

13:34:47.905 --> 13:34:49.140

IN ORDER TO BRING UP MAYBE

13:37:34.572 --> 13:37:37.508
FIVE. I WAS VERY CLEAR WITH THE

13:37:37.575 --> 13:37:39.310
FOLKS IN THE SENATE. THAT I

13:37:39.377 --> 13:37:40.544
WOULD DO THAT AND I SAID FILLED

MY RESPONSIBILITY IN FACT BY

13:37:42.546 --> 13:37:43.881
NOW PRESENTING THIS FOR THE

13:37:43.948 --> 13:37:46.350
THIRD TIME. BUT I WAS ALSO VERY

13:37:46.417 --> 13:37:47.451
CLEAR THAT I PERSONALLY WOULD

13:37:47.518 --> 13:37:50.054
NOT BE VOTING FOR IT. AND THAT

13:37:50.121 --> 13:37:51.989
I WOULD EXPRESS THAT IN SO I

13:37:52.056 --> 13:37:54.191
WOULD BE. I I'M NOT ASKING

13:37:54.258 --> 13:37:55.760
ANYBODY TO NOT VOTE FOR IT I'M

13:37:55.826 --> 13:37:57.628
NOT ASKING ANYBODY TO VOTE OR

13:37:57.695 --> 13:37:59.463
SOMETHING I CAN'T VOTE FOR. SO

13:37:59.530 --> 13:38:00.865
I JUST WANT TO BE ON IS THAT

13:38:00.931 --> 13:38:01.932
WHILE THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN

13:38:01.999 --> 13:38:04.502
AGREEMENT. THE NEWSPAPERS NEVER

13:38:04.568 --> 13:38:05.369

CONTEXT TO THIS THE LAST FEW

15:01:33.606 --> 15:01:35.608
YEARS WE'VE STEPPED UP TO

ABOUT EXPANDING PRESCHOOL IT'S

15:01:39.812 --> 15:01:44.517
REALLY TWO THINGS IT'S A IT'S

AND TIME AGAIN SCHOOL DISTRICTS

15:01:56.796 --> 15:02:00.399
SAY. THEY CAN'T FILL THE SLOT

15:02:00.466 --> 15:02:01.767
BECAUSE THEY NEED FACILITIES SO

15:02:01.834 --> 15:02:03.402
IT'S LIKE A KIND OF A CATCH

15:02:03.469 --> 15:02:04.870
TWENTY TWO YEAR WHICH IS WHY

15:02:04.937 --> 15:02:08.507

AB FORTY EIGHT THIS MEASURE

15:06:28.233 --> 15:06:30.602
WOULD AUTHORIZE THE ISSUANCE OF

15:06:30.669 --> 15:06:31.570
FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS OF

15:06:31.637 --> 15:06:34.006
BONDS TO FUND SCHOOL FACILITY%

15:06:34.073 --> 15:06:35.841
CONSTRUCTION I AM VERY

15:06:35.908 --> 15:06:37.976
SUPPORTIVE OF SCHOOL FACILITY

15:06:38.043 --> 15:06:38.510
CONSTRUCTION I THINK IT'S

15:06:38.577 --> 15:06:39.111
APPROPRIATE THE STATE SHOULD

15:06:39.178 --> 15:06:42.281
FUNDED. THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE

15:06:42.347 --> 15:06:42.915
WITH FIFTEEN BILLION AS I DON'T

15:06:42.981 --> 15:06:43.549
THINK IT'S HIGH ENOUGH I WHICH

15:06:43.615 --> 15:06:45.584
WAS MORE BUT MY PROBLEM WITH

15:06:45.651 --> 15:06:49.221
THIS BILL IS THIS. WE'RE

15:06:49.288 --> 15:06:50.155
ISSUING FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS

15:06:50.222 --> 15:06:51.757
OF BONDS IN A YEAR WHEN WE HAVE

15:06:51.824 --> 15:06:53.592
A TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLAR

15:06:53.659 --> 15:06:56.762
BUDGET SURPLUS. TO PUT THAT IN

15:06:56.829 --> 15:06:59.998
CONTEXT IT'S LIKE A FAMILY HAS

15:07:00.065 --> 15:07:00.566
TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE

15:07:00.632 --> 15:07:02.401
BANK THEY WANT TO TAKE A

15:07:02.468 --> 15:07:03.802
THOUSAND DOLLAR VACATION BUT

15:07:03.869 --> 15:07:04.436
INSTEAD OF USING THE MONEY THAT

15:07:04.503 --> 15:07:07.172
THEY PUT IN THE BANK. THEY

15:07:07.239 --> 15:07:08.707
CHARGE THE VACATION ON THEIR

15:07:08.774 --> 15:07:09.341
HIGH INTEREST CREDIT CARD THAT

15:07:09.408 --> 15:07:11.610
MAKES NO SENSE. CURRENTLY THE

15:07:11.677 --> 15:07:13.912
STATE HAS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND

15:07:13.979 --> 15:07:14.813
FIFTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS OF

15:07:14.880 --> 15:07:17.149
LONG TERM BOND DEBT. SO BY

15:07:17.216 --> 15:07:18.417
AUTHORIZING THIS WE'RE GOING TO

15:07:18.484 --> 15:07:21.253
ADD ABOUT TEN PERCENT. DOOR

15:07:21.320 --> 15:07:21.854
STATES OVERALL DEBT AT THAT IS

15:07:21.920 --> 15:07:26.592
SIGNIFICANT. NOW THAT IS IN A

15:07:26.658 --> 15:07:27.760
YEAR. WHEN DEBT SERVICE IS ONE

15:07:27.826 --> 15:07:29.394
OF THE FASTEST GROWING

15:07:29.461 --> 15:07:29.962
OBLIGATIONS FROM THE GENERAL

15:07:30.028 --> 15:07:32.765
FUND. NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE A

15:07:32.831 --> 15:07:35.601
BUDGET SURPLUS THIS YEAR.

15:07:35.667 --> 15:07:36.735
ECONOMIC TIMES HERE IN

15:07:36.802 --> 15:07:37.903
CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY

15:07:37.970 --> 15:07:39.838
GOOD SO THAT'S THE LAST THING

15:07:39.905 --> 15:07:40.606
THAT YOU WANT TO DO WHEN TIMES

15:07:40.672 --> 15:07:42.508
ARE GOOD IS TO ADD TO THE DEBT

15:07:42.574 --> 15:07:44.143
IN FACT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS

15:07:44.209 --> 15:07:46.111
THE OPPOSITE WHEN TIMES ARE

15:07:46.178 --> 15:07:46.745
GOOD YOU WANT TO PAY DOWN. THAT

15:07:46.812 --> 15:07:49.381
LONG TERM DEBT. PUT LESS COST

15:07:49.448 --> 15:07:51.583
PRESSURE ON THE GENERAL FUND

15:07:51.650 --> 15:07:52.184
LEADER IN YEARS WHEN TIMES ARE

15:07:52.251 --> 15:07:55.487
NOT SO GOOD. AND I THINK THE

15:07:55.554 --> 15:07:57.556
WORST PROBLEM WITH THIS MEASURE

15:07:57.623 --> 15:07:59.057
IS THIS WE KNOW THAT WHEN WE

15:07:59.124 --> 15:08:01.927
BORROW MONEY. WE FINANCE A BOND

15:08:01.994 --> 15:08:02.561
OVER TWENTY YEARS IT ACTUALLY

15:08:02.628 --> 15:08:05.497
COSTS US TWO DOLLARS TO PAY

15:08:05.564 --> 15:08:06.198
BACK THAT MONEY FOR EVERY

15:08:06.265 --> 15:08:08.534
DOLLAR THAT WE BORROWED. SO TO

15:08:08.600 --> 15:08:09.134
PUT THAT A DIFFERENT WAY IF WE

15:08:09.201 --> 15:08:11.837
INSTEAD DECIDED TODAY. WE WERE

15:08:11.904 --> 15:08:12.437
GOING TO TAKE THAT ONE AND A

15:08:12.504 --> 15:08:13.806
HALF BILLION DOLLARS THAT IS

15:08:13.872 --> 15:08:14.807
GOING TO A YEAR THAT IS GOING

15:08:14.873 --> 15:08:16.608
TO TAKE TO SERVICE THAT BOND.

15:08:16.675 --> 15:08:17.709
OVER THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS AND

15:08:17.776 --> 15:08:19.545
SPEND THAT MONEY. ON THE

15:08:19.611 --> 15:08:20.879
CONSTRUCTION OF EDUCATIONAL

15:08:20.946 --> 15:08:23.782
FACILITIES WE COULD BUILD TWICE

15:08:23.849 --> 15:08:25.684
AS MANY SCHOOLS TWICE AS MANY

15:08:25.751 --> 15:08:26.185
PRESCHOOLS TWICE AS MANY

15:08:26.251 --> 15:08:30.556
COLLEGES. THAT'S A MUCH BETTER

15:08:30.622 --> 15:08:32.991
WAY OF GOING ABOUT THIS THAN TO

15:08:33.058 --> 15:08:33.625
PUT THE STATE FURTHER IN DEBT I

15:08:33.692 --> 15:08:39.698

COMMITMENT TO EARLY CHILDHOOD

15:08:43.735 --> 15:08:47.306
EDUCATION. THIS GOVERNOR

15:08:47.372 --> 15:08:48.941
CAMPAIGNED ON EARLY CHILDHOOD

15:08:49.007 --> 15:08:53.078
EDUCATION AND I KNOW THAT

15:08:53.145 --> 15:08:54.213
PRESCHOOL IS PERMISSIVE IN THIS

15:08:54.279 --> 15:08:57.883
BONDS. BUT RECOGNIZE WE HAVE

15:08:57.950 --> 15:08:58.450
STARVED SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR

15:08:58.517 --> 15:09:02.521
YEARS. OF FACILITIES MONEY AND

15:09:02.588 --> 15:09:03.822
THEY HAVE LOTS OF NEEDS OF

THOSE NEEDS ARE GOING TO BE MET

15:09:07.092 --> 15:09:07.626
FIRST ANY SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER

15:09:07.693 --> 15:09:10.128
WILL TELL YOU THAT. PLUS WE

15:09:10.195 --> 15:09:12.364
HAVE NOT FUNDED THE RATES FOR

15:09:12.431 --> 15:09:14.533
PRESCHOOL AT LEVELS THAT ALLOW

15:09:14.600 --> 15:09:16.602
SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO REALLY BE

15:09:16.668 --> 15:09:19.204
ABLE TO FUND THESE PROGRAMS AT

THAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO.

15:09:21.907 --> 15:09:23.876

DISTRICTS WILL BE APPLYING FOR

15:09:31.250 --> 15:09:33.752
