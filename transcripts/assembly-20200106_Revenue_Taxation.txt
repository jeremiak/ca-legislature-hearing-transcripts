ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN UP TO. WELL WE'RE STARTING AT THE SUBCOMMITTEE. HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYBODY. WELL THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS BILL I'M PROUD TO PRESENT AB EIGHT FIFTY WHICH CREATES A LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM FOR CHILD WELFARE WORKERS CURRENTLY THERE'S A AN EXTREMELY HIGH TURNOVER RATE FOR CHILD WELFARE WORKERS WITHIN THE STATE AND ESPECIALLY WITHIN THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF ENTERING THE WORKFORCE. THERE ARE NUMBER FACTORS CONTRIBUTE TO THIS SUCH A STRESS COURSE LONG HOURS AND INCREASED CASELOADS. CHILD WELFARE WORKERS ARE AMONG THE LOWEST PAID SOCIAL WORKERS EVEN THOUGH THE ACCOUNT FOR NEARLY HALF OF ALL CHILD FAMILY AND SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKERS IN THE STATE. NEARLY HALF THE WORKFORCE IS OVER THE AGE OF FORTY. AND THE DIVERSE COMPOSITION OF CHILDREN IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM DOES NOT REFLECT. THAT OF THE WORKFORCE. THIS PROFESSION NEEDS DIVERSITY AND YOUNGER STAFF TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS ISSUES IT'LL COMMUNITIES. AB EIGHT FIFTY ADDRESSES THESE ISSUES BY CREATING A SYSTEM FOR CHILD WERE FOR WORKERS WHERE UPON THE COMPLETION OF THREE YEARS THE STATE WILL PAY 50% OF THE REMAINING DEBT. FOR THOSE WHO RECEIVED THEIR BACHELOR'S OR MASTER'S DEGREE IN SOCIAL WORK. THIS BILL IS A FORCE OR THE LA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS. THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. AND CAL SWC. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY AS REBEKAH GONZALEZ WITH THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS. RIGHT CHARRON MEMBERS MY NAME IS REBECCA GONZALEZ I'M I'M THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS WITH THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER WE'RE A PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION THAT REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY TEN THOUSAND SOCIAL WORKERS WITH THEIR BACHELOR'S OR THEIR MASTER'S DEGREE IN SOCIAL WORK WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL I WANT TO THANK THE MEMBER FOR INTRODUCING AT- TOO GREAT A LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM- AS- WAS ALLUDED TO- STUDENT LOANS ARE A TO TERROR AND FOR DIVERSITY AND LONG TERM RETENTION. THE MEAN SALARY FOR ALL THE WELFARE WORKERS IS FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THE MEANS STUDENT LOAN DEBT RANGES FROM THIRTY TWO THOUSAND TO FORTY TWO THOUSAND THE PRESSURE OF MAKING ENDS MEET WITH LOW SALARIES AND HIGH INTEREST RATE IS CAUSING COLLEGE GRADUATES TO PURSUE MORE LUCRATIVE CAREERS. CONSEQUENTLY THIS REALLY NEGATIVELY IMPACTS CHILDREN WHO WERE IN THE SYSTEM- THAT RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE NATIONAL ANNUAL TURNOVER RATE IN CHILD WELFARE IS 20% IN PUBLIC AGENCIES AND 40% AND PRIVATE AGENCIES. WHEN A CHILD WORKER. BEES WITHIN THE FIRST THREE YEARS THAT IT MUST HAVE. HE TO UNDER PERCENT OF THE EXIST EMPLOYEES ANNUAL SALARY FOR HIRING AND TRAINING NEW STAFF THIS IS UNFORTUNATE AS I MENTIONED BECAUSE CHILDREN GOING THROUGH THE SYSTEM BENEFIT FROM CONSISTENCY CONSISTENCY WITH THEIR CARE GIVERS AND CONSISTENCY WITH THEIR SOCIAL WORKERS. THE PROGRAM IS IMPORTANT FOR OUR PROFESSION BECAUSE STUDENT LOAN BURDENS CAN DISCOURAGE THE PURSUIT OF SOCIAL WORK CAREERS AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR SOCIAL WORKERS WITH STUDENT LOANS TO REACH SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL NOT MILESTONES LIKE PURCHASING A HOME OR SAVING FOR RETIREMENT. A MATCH LEARN ABOUT A MASTER'S OR BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN SOCIAL WORK IS THE GOLD STANDARD FOR CHILD WELFARE WORKERS THE SOCIAL WORK CURRICULUM AND STANDARDS REQUIRE A WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF CHILD AND ADULT DEVELOPMENT. THE IMPACT OF TRAUMA PARENTING AND FAMILY DYNAMICS AND COMMUNITY SYSTEMS WHERE THE CHILD AND FAMILY RESIDE. IN ADDITION SOCIAL WORKERS AND CHILD WELFARE SHALL HAVE A PROVEN ABILITY TO APPLY THIS KNOWLEDGE TO APPROPRIATELY INTERVIEW CONTENT PRESS THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND FAMILY. IN ORDER TO PREVENT HARM TO THE TILE AND MAXIMIZE THE FAMILY'S CHANCES FOR POSITIVE FUNCTIONING AND STABILITY FOR ALL THESE REASONS JURAI VOTE. SO WHAT ADDITIONAL WITNESSES FOR. DON'T BE SCARED THE REALLY NICE THE FIRST PART RIGHT MY NAME IS KINDER BARNES AND A MASTER'S STUDENT AT SAN JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU. MY NAME IS LUCRETIA THOMPSON AND I'M A STUDENT AT NORTHRIDGE MASTERS SOCIAL WORK AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK.

SEEING NONE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE OF WITH MIA COMMENTS QUESTIONS ARE MADE OUT QUIRK SO THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT. DON'T LOOK BAD ON HAPPY TARA YOU'RE LOOKING VERY UNHAPPY. I'M READY OKAY. THE LIKE SFETY I KNOW I'M READY THE FTV IS HERE I WANTED TO ASK THEM THEY'RE ESTIMATING THE REVENUE LOSS OF NINETY THOUSAND A HUNDRED THOUSAND SIXTY THOUSAND. THAT'S LIKE TO LOANS. THIS IS IN- FISCAL YEAR IS- THIS YEAR NEXT YEAR THE YEAR AFTER AND. IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW WHO'S GOING TO CLAIM IT AND WHAT THE- HOW MUCH THEY'RE GOING TO CLAIM CERTAINLY THEY'RE GOING TO BE. I WOULD IMAGINE DOZENS OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD CLAIM UNDER THE S. AND SO I DON'T SEE HOW THE NUMBERS CAN BE THIS LOW. GOOD QUESTION MEMBER QUIRK. MY LIFE. OKAY THANK YOU IT'S BEEN AWHILE SINCE I'VE BEEN UP HERE AT JENNA CARLSON ASSISTANT LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR FRANCHISE TAX BOARD HAPPY NEW YEAR AND ONLY YOU. I'VE IT'S INTERESTING THERE WAS A LOT OF HAIR CUTS TO GET DOWN TO WHAT SEEMS TO BE A VERY LOW- UNUSUALLY LOW AMOUNT. OUR DATA IS BASED ON INFORMATION FROM THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THE NATIONAL US DISSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS. AND ONE THING THAT REALLY LIMITS THAT FIRST POPULATION IS THE REQUIREMENT FOR LEGIBILITY IS THAT YOU HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED FOR THREE YEARS SO THERE'S THAT TRIGGERING EVENT. AND WHAT WE HAVE IS THAT- THERE ARE. APPROXIMATELY THREE THOUSAND- CALIFORNIA CHILD WILL FORCE WELFARE SOCIAL WORKERS WITH EITHER A MESS BACHELOR'S OR MASTER'S DEGREE IN SOCIAL WORK FOR TAX YEAR TWO TWENTY TWENTY. AND THAT 10% OR THREE HUNDRED OF THOSE WORKERS WOULD HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED BY EITHER STATE OR COUNTY AND WOULD HAVE MET THAT. TRIGGERING DATE SO THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF. THAN THE NUMBERS YOU HAVE HERE TRUE AND IT IS A 50% AWARD SO THAT AGAIN IS A FURTHER HAIR CUT AND ALSO WITH THE STUDENT AID DATA THAT WE WERE ABLE TO FIND BASED ON A REMAINING STUDENT LOAN PRINCIPLE AFTER THE THREE YEAR PERIOD WE WERE LOOKING AT ONLY SIX MILLION DOLLARS SO ONLY A THREE MILLION DOLLAR. OVERALL RIGHT AND THEN YOU HAVE THAT 250% AND YOU GET THREE MILLION. RIGHT AND BUT THEN WE ARE ALSO EXCLUDING FROM INCOME AS OPPOSED TO EVER INCLUDING IN INCOME SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT. THIS IS AN INCOME EXCLUSION. SO DOES NOT ON THE TAX RETURN DIRECTLY. OKAY BUT IT'S STILL GONNA COST IS THREE MILLION DOLLARS. IN I'M NO AT A 6% TAX RATE- AND BAY- IT'S- I'M SORRY IT'S NOT CLOSE THROUGH THE TAX RETURN RIGHT IT'S NOT JUST A STRAIGHT THREE MILLION. OKAY IT'S ONLY TAXES DO SO EVEN THE THREE MILLION MAY NOT ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN ALL TAXABLE IF IT WERE OTHERWISE INCLUDED IN INCOME BECAUSE OF OTHER DEDUCTIONS ARE OFFSETS THAT A STUDENT MAY HAVE. YOU'RE GRANTING THEM THREE MILLION DOLLARS RIGHT. WE BELIEVE SO WHY ISN'T THE COST THREE MILLION DOLLARS BUT THE COST ON THE TAXES SO IT'S THREE MILLION OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND AND THAT'S WHY YOU DIDN'T INCLUDE IT. NO IT'S THE THREE MILLION IS APPLIED THERE'S A AN AVERAGE TAX RATE THAT IS APPLIED. AND THAT IS WHAT THE DIFFERENCE TO THE GENERAL FUND WOULD BE. 6% OF THREE MILLION. OKAY HEY OKAY AYE AYE AYE ALL RIGHT LOOSES AGAIN AS IT RUNS THROUGH THE TAX RETURN AND THERE'S OTHER DEDUCTIONS OR EXEMPTIONS EXCLUSIONS THAT SOMEONE MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR THAT ALSO COMES INTO PLAY IN THE FINAL NUMBER. I'M SO GLAD SHE'S HERE. I'M SORRY I DIDN'T QUITE HEAR YOU. ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE REWARDING THREE MILLION DOLLARS WE BELIEVE SO. AT THIRTY GETTING AWAY CORRECT WE HAVE ASSUME YES IT'LL BE FULLY FUNDED AND THAT WOULD BE THE FUNDED HOWSAM ON THAT COULD BE GRANTED OKAY BUT HOW IS IT FULLY FUNDED. THAT IS A FUNCTION OF THE BILL. OR STAND IT WOULD NEED APPROPRIATIONS HELP IT'S NOT FUNDED THROUGH THE BUDGET IT DOES THE BILL DOESN'T DO ANYTHING RIGHT. CORRECT I SEE ALL RIGHT. THAT'S WHY THE NUMBERS SO LOW. DOES COME INTO PLAY YEAH IT IT IT HAS TO BE FUNDED THROUGH THE BUDGET ALL RIGHT NOW I UNDERSTAND. SO IT'S THREE MILLION DOLLARS IF IT'S FUNDED THROUGH THE BUDGET AND IT'S NEXT TO NOTHING OTHERWISE. OKAY NOW I UNDERSTAND OF. SO I JUST TO BRING AND THEN ONE OTHER POINT THAT'S BROUGHT UP IN THE ANALYSIS IS. V. E. ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT'LL BE FEDERALLY TAXED. I SINCE IT'S A GRANT IT'S INCOME. AND SO THAT. PERSON WHO GOT THIS MONEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY WHATEVER THEIR FEDERAL TAX AMOUNT IS ON THAT AMOUNT BECAUSE RATHER THE LOAN FORGIVENESS IT TO GRANT SO IT'S INCOME. ARM AND- THEIR WAYS TO GET AROUND THAT BUT- I CAN SEE WHY YOU CAN'T NECESSARILY PUT IN THE BILL DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENT ON THAT DOOR FOR WORKING THROUGH SOME OF THESE COMPLEXITIES BUT WE THINK THEY'RE ALL WORKABLE. OKAY. THEN MY FINAL QUESTION IS. YOU KNOW I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF BURN OUT. BUT IF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO. IS PROMOTE PEOPLE TO STAY WHY IS IT THREE YEARS. THAT'S THE AVERAGE. TIME THE MOST THE PEOPLE ARE LEAVING AS YEAH I'D SO WHY NOT MAKE IT FIVE YEARS TO AT LEAST KEEP THEM AROUND A COUPLE MORE YEARS THE POINT IS YOU'RE NOT GIVING IT YOUR SPENDING THREE MILLION DOLLARS BUT YOU'RE NOT NECESSARILY GETTING ANYTHING FOR IT. IF PEOPLE ARE TYPICALLY SPENDING THREE YEARS ALREADY WHY NOT THEN YOU KNOW DO SOMETHING SO THOSE STAY A BIT LONGER. SO THE POINT IS YOU NEED MORE SOCIAL WORKERS THERE TYPICALLY LEAVING AFTER THREE YEARS. IF YOU KEEP THIS. TIME PERIOD IS THREE YEARS THEN HOW ARE YOU GOING TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO STAY A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. WHY NOT MAKE IT FIVE YEARS AND THEN YOU AT LEAST GET A COUPLE EXTRA YEARS OUT OF IT THAT'S CLEARLY AN ALTERNATE PERSPECTIVE BUT I WOULD SAY THAT WE WANT TO GET ON WITH THEIR MOST VULNERABLE PERIOD WHICH IS PROVEN TO BE THREE YEAR. I DON'T UNDERSTAND BECAUSE YEAH PLEASE IF I COULD ADD SOMETHING THAT GO WITH THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER PROGRAM THAT HELPS PEOPLE WHILE THEY'RE IN SCHOOL IF THEY- AGREE IT'S CALLED THE TITLE FOR YOU PROGRAM IF THEY DOES IF THEY PROMISE TO MAKE A TWO YEAR COMMITMENT IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM WHEN THEY GRADUATE SO WE DO FIND A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LEAVING AFTER TWO YEARS I THINK THREE YEAR IS A MARK BUT THAT TWO YEARS IS A HUGE MARK ALSO SO. I THINK THAT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOOSING THE THREE YEAR TIME FRAME MAKES SENSE OKAY. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE ASSEMBLYMEMBER LIKE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I WOULD JUST TELL YOU IN MY DISTRICT THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM TRULY NEEDS HELP WHAT WE ARE PROBABLY THE- I THINK ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGE DISTRICTS IN THE ENTIRE STATE WITH THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM WE'VE HAD A LOT OF TRAGEDY. AND A HIGH TURNOVER RATE IS REALLY AN ORDERLY IMPACT IN MY DISTRICT AND SO WE REALLY WANT TO PROVIDE A REMEDY. TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE ADDRESS THESE ISSUES THAT I TALKED ABOUT IN MY OPENING STATEMENT SO WE WOULD APPRECIATE AN AYE VOTE WHEN AND- WHEN WE GET THERE. THANK YOU FOR TESTIMONY ONLY BUT WE HAVE A QUORUM SO WE'D LIKE THIS HIGHLY CALDERON. KIRK HERE ROBERT. TO THEIR GRAY. MAYES MELENDEZ MULLIN PETRIE-NORRIS. QUIRK HERE RIVAS. TING THE BILL WHICH ACCORDING. WE HAVE A QUORUM THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR CHAIR MEMBERS HAPPY NEW YEAR.

THANK YOU WHEN THIS IS IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE THAT WORK. BALLOT YOU YOU AND I HAVE SERVED ON THIS COMMITTEE TOGETHER A LONG TIME SO YOU KNOW WHAT MY FIRST QUESTION IS A HIS ARM I WOULD PREFER A REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT. WHICH WENT TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT PAYING TAXES AS OPPOSED TO THE MORE WEALTHY PEOPLE WHO ARE PAYING TAXES AND SO THAT'S- ALWAYS MY NUMBER ONE CONCERN WITH ANY TAX DEDUCTION. ARM THE SECOND POURING POINT IS. WELL WHAT DO YOU WANT TO WELL WHY DON'T YOU ARE WELL ANYONE TO THAT WHEN THE MAIN THING IS WE'RE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO GO ON THESE PROFESSIONS WE HAVE A HUGE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA AND WE DON'T HAVE THE FACILITIES OR THE PROFESSIONALS TO TREAT THESE PEOPLE AND- IT'S JUST LIKE IF YOU LOOK AT THE JOB WE NEED TRUCK DRIVERS WE NEED PLUMBERS- WE NEED NOT OF PROFESSIONALS WE NEED ENGINEERS- AND THERE'S BEEN OTHER PROGRAMS FOR NURSES TO PAY OFF A BUNCH OF PEOPLE TO GO INTO NURSING. YOU KNOW PEOPLE JOIN THE MILLER. GI BILL. AGAINST PEOPLE TO GO INTO THE SESSIONS THAT WE NEED CURRENTLY AND THIS IS JUST. WE CAN DEBATE THE- THE TAX BENEFITS FROM ONE CLASS OR ANOTHER BUT THIS BILL IS MAINLY TO TRY TO GET PEOPLE TO. ENROLL IN MENTAL HEALTH EDUCATION AND GOING TO THAT HIS PROFESSION RIGHT IN AND MY CONCERN IS THAT IT'S GOING TO THE WRONG PEOPLE NOT THE PEOPLE WHO NEED. THE HELP THE MOST. BUT TO PEOPLE WHO CAN ALREADY AFFORD TO PAY TAXES ON A TAX RELIEF THIS IS JUST IF YOU IF YOUR LICENSING FEE FOR THE FIRST YEAR OF FIVE HUNDRED. AND I BELIEVE WE MAY HAPPEN IN THAT. THROUGH THE AIR. YOU GET YOUR FIRST WAVE TO THE BOX. SO IT'S A LICENSING FEE REDUCTION- IT'S A LICENSING FEE REDUCTION YEAH ALL RIGHT CELLS THAT'S NOT THE WAY I READ IT I RATED EASY IT'S EASING THE LICENSING FEE FOR PEOPLE WHO A TAX CREDIT. BUT IT'S NOT A REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT. WE HAVE THAT. RIGHT OR THE STANDARD TAX CREDIT. SO HI. NO I UNDERSTAND THAT NO MIKE MY CONCERN IS NOT A REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT SO THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LOWEST ON THE INCOME SCALE GET NO BALLOT AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS WE- WERE TRYING TO REDUCE THE LICENSING FEE. I KNOW BUT PEOPLE WHO NEED THE HELP THE MOST ARE GETTING. YEAH I. BUT YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD ME SAY THIS SHADOW YEARS SALE BUT YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE A MILLIONAIRE YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING INTO THE MENTAL HEALTH FIELD TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. WE MIGHT BE GOING. STATE WHATEVER YEAH BUT I MEAN WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT MILLIONAIRES BUT AT ANY RATE. UP THE OTHER CONCERN IS WHY THESE PARTICULAR- PEOPLE WHY REAL ESTATE WHITE NURSING WHICH YOU SAID ALREADY HAS OTHER PROGRAMS. WHY DID YOU PARTICULARLY PICKED THE SAP A CONTRACTOR STATE LICENSING BOARD WHY DID YOU PARTICULARLY PICKED THESE. BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE JOB DEMANDS IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW ITS TRUCK DRIVERS IT'S- PLUMBERS. IT'S MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS THESE ARE THE YOU KNOW IT'S- ENGINEERS- WE NEED PEOPLE TO GO IN THESE INDUSTRIES FOR THE FUTURE CALIFORNIA SO THEY'RE NOT ON YOUR LIST. UNION HAVE ENGINEERING HERE YOU DON'T HAVE. I TAKE ON ALL THE INDUSTRIES OF JUST. THE ONES YOU JUST MENTIONED ARE NOT PART OF THE LIST ALL RIGHT. THAT'S FINE. I WILL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT THANKS THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FOR THE COMMITTEE. I THINK YOU KNOW DOCTOR PARKS POINTS THAT I THINK HE MAKES A REGULARLY OR HEAR ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT TEN AND ALL THE OTHER THING TOO IS YOU KNOW WHAT I HAD MY FIRST MEETING IN THE OFFICE BEFORE I EVEN GOT INTO THE OFFICE AND IT WAS ENROLLED AGENTS WHO ARE HERE TALKING ABOUT SERVICE TAXES AND I THINK. PART OF THAT WAS TO GET THE WHOLE CONVERSATION. STE CONVERSATION ABOUT BUDGET REFER. AND BE. RELY ON PERSONALLY TAX INCOME THAT. BALANCING OUT THE MOUNTAINS AND TROUGHS IN. YOU KNOW. YOU'VE GOT. A COUPLE OF MISTER QUIRK IN MR TANG NUMBERS COMMITTEE BEEN HERE A TERM BEFORE ME. AND WE CNTINUE TO TALK ABOUT THAT BUT I THINK- SINCE THAT MACRO BUDGET PROCESS REFORM HAS NOT BEEN. TACKLED YET YOU KNOW SOME OF US STILL TRY TO GO ABOUT THE ANYTHING EVEN WHEN GOVERNOR BROWN WAS AND HE WOULD GIVE THESE VETO MESSAGE THIS ISN'T THE BEST WAY TO DO THE BUDGET. BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS AND SOME OF US TRY TO WORK THROUGH THE PROCESS TO. GET SOME CREDIT SIR. OR SOME TREES. I THINK YOU.
