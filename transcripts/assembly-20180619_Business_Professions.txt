FOR YOUR PATIENCE THIS MORNING AND I I I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT THIS BILL THAT DEALS WITH THAT EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES FOR DOGS AND CATS. IT MAY SURPRISE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BUT ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND PETS DIE. IN HOUSE FIRES IN THE UNITED STATES EVERY YEAR. I AND I THIS BILL WILL ALLOW FIRST RESPONDERS TO PROVIDE. BASIC FIRST AID ANIMALS ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS AT THE SCENE OF AN EMERGENCY PRIOR TO TRANSFER IN THE ANIMAL TO A VETERINARY CARE FACILITY. IMPORTANTLY THIS BILL PROTECTS FIRST RESPONDERS BY MAKING EXPLICIT. THAT THEY ARE NOT LIABLE FOR CIVIL DAMAGES OR SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL PROSECUTION OR PROFESSIONAL DISCIPLINARY ACTION FOR ADMINISTERING BASIC FIRST DAY. MANY OTHER STATES HAVE ADOPTED SIMILAR LAWS. A COLORADO WAS THE FIRST TO PASS SUCH A MEASURE IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN FOLLOWED BY OKLAHOMA IN ALL TWENTY TWO STATES NOW ALLOW FIRST RESPONDERS TO PROVIDE. AID ANIMALS WITHOUT FEAR. OF PROSECUTION. BUT MANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MAY BE AWARE THAT. I WHEN GOVERNOR BROWN WAS FIRST ELECTED THAT I WAS ON HIS STAFF. I AND WAS -- INVOLVED IN THE CARE OF SUTTER BROWN WHO WAS THE FIRST DOG AT THE TIME HE HAS SINCE PASSED AWAY HE WAS A GREAT AMBASSADOR -- AND GREAT ADVOCATE FOR ANIMAL WELFARE -- WE UP TO SPEED IN MANY EVENTS TO HELP [inaudible] APORTA. ANIMALS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS AND IT IS FOR THOSE REASONS THAT I I THOUGHT IN MEMORY OF SUTTER THAT IT WOULD BE A NICE THING TO DO I ON THIS MEASURE THAT HE WAS SO INVOLVED IN ANIMAL WELFARE. I TODAY I'M JOINED BY BY MY CONSTITUENTS SHAKER WHO IS A VETERINARIAN WITH THIRTY FIVE YEARS EXPERIENCE IN THE TRI VALLEY. ABROAD AS THE IDEA FOR THIS BILL AND THE DANIEL HARDING OR THE BATTALION CHIEF IN THE UC DAVIS FIRE DEPARTMENTS [inaudible] AND I HAPPY TO HEAR THEIR TESTIMONY IF IT PLEASES THE CHAIR. YOU VERY MUCH PLEASE. I I AM OF AN AMERICAN PRIVATE PRACTICE FOR OVER FORTY YEARS HERE'S ON NO NORMAL FIRE JUST. HE LIKE I KNOW. BOND VERY WELL I ALSO KNOW THAT THEY'RE CAPABLE OF ADMINISTERING BASIC FIRST AID AND THE VAST MAJORITY WANT TO TREAT ANIMALS AT EMERGENCY SCENES -- I ALSO KNOW THAT -- PROFESSIONAL VENIER CARE WILL RARELY BE AVAILABLE AT AN EMERGENCY SCENE -- THIS BILL DOES ALLOW FOR FIRE DSTRICTS TO OPT OUT IT'S VOLUNTARY -- I'D I KNOW THAT MY BOARD -- ARE OF COMMAND STAFF ALL OF OUR CERTAINLY ALL OF THE THE UNION BOARD -- ARE CERTAIN IN FAVOR OF SB THIRTEEN OH FIVE I WOULD BE SITTING HERE IF THEY WEREN'T IN FAVOR OF IT -- AND I'D JUST LIKE TO CONTINUE WITH ADJUSTING A QUICK ILLUSTRATION HERE -- WHAT ARE OUR CREWS GO THROUGH IN AND WE HAD A RECENT HOUSE STRUCTURE FIRE -- BASED SAY THAT MOST OF THE STRUCTURE OF BUT THEY COULD NOT SEE THE DOG THAT WAS TRAPPED INSIDE. AND A HOMEOWNERS IN THIS CASE LOSS TO SIGNIFICANT PART OF THEIR HOME -- BUT THEY WERE MOST DISTRAUGHT ABOUT THE LOSS OF THEIR BELOVED LABRADOR RETRIEVER. HER NAME WAS VIOLENT -- THE SEASON FIREFIGHTERS -- DID THEIR BEST -- BUT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT THEY WOULD NOT AT LEAST TRY TO SAY VIOLENT. AND NOT THE LEGAL THING FOR THEM TO DO AT THIS POINT AT THIS STAGE -- WOULD HAVE BEEN TO REMOVE VIOLET FROM THE STRUCTURE AND TRANSPORTED TO A VETERINARIAN -- WITHOUT WITHOUT ANY BASIC FOR STATE [inaudible] I VIOLET DIDN'T SURVIVE THIS INCIDENT BUT OUR ONLY SHOT AT SURVIVAL WAS LIFESAVING FIRST AID ON SCENE. EVEN A FIVE TO TEN MINUTE TRANSPORT -- WOULD HAVE DIRECT DRAMATICALLY REDUCED TO ANY ANY CHANCE OF SURVIVAL. AB VIOLENT BEEN THE PERSON -- IT'S JUST NOT PROVIDING BASIC FOR STATE WOULD BE INCONCEIVABLE AND AND I BELIEVE THAT OUR PETS ARE TOO IMPORTANT TO NOT. ALSO GIVE THEM THE BEST SHOT IT SURVIVING AN EMERGENCY AND I URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF SB. THIRTEEN OH FIVE YOU VERY MUCH. MORNING -- MY NAME IS THAT HARD JEREMIAH TWENTY YEAR VETERAN THE FIRE SERVICE IN ASSISTANT CHIEF WITH UC DAVIS OUR APARTMENT. I CAME TO MY ATTENTION LAST YEAR THAT THE ADMINISTRATION OF OCT INDEPENDENCE BY MERGERS FUNDERS WAS ILLEGAL IN CALIFORNIA.

AND ANIMAL SUPPORT GROUPS OF YOUNG FUNDRAISING PLACED PET SIZE AUCTION ADMINISTRATION MASKS ON FIRE ENGINES AND MANY CITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE INCLUDING RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO -- IN THIS IS A BIG SURPRISE ME THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS ILLEGAL. ANIMALS CAN EASILY BECOME TRAPPED IN INJURED HOMES WHEN THEY CATCH ON FIRE AND FIREFIGHTERS ARE OFTEN ABLE TO RESCUE THE ANIMALS FROM THESE FIRES. AND AND THEN WE WANT TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO HELP SAVE THEM. UNDER CURRENT LAW THAT WE HAVE THE ENDING AND AN EVIL CHOICE TO EITHER BREAK THE LAW ON SAY THE AM OR LET THE AND HOPE TO ACTUALLY DIE. I WAS FACED WITH THIS EXACT CHOICE THIS PAST YEAR AT A FIRE FIVE CATS WERE TRAPPED IN A SMOKY HOUSE FIRE AND WERE STRUGGLING TO BREATHE. NOT GOING TO LET THE ANIMAL SUFFERED WE ADMINISTERED OXYGEN WITH THE SAME EQUIPMENT CARRIED ON MOST FIRE ENGINES ACROSS THE STATE WERE ABLE TO TREAT THE CATS AND SOME ON THE WAY TO SEE ABOUT. FIREFIGHTERS SHOULDN'T HAVE TO RISK THEIR MEDICAL CERTIFICATIONS A POTENTIAL LEGAL PENALTIES TO SAVE THE LIVES OF INNOCENT ANIMALS AND I ASK THAT YOU HELP US FIX THIS PROBLEM.

VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR PASSION ON THIS ISSUE AND WE WILL TAKE THIS UP WE HAVE A QUORUM. NOW MOVE ON TO FILE ITEM NUMBER SEVEN WHICH IS S. B. TWELVE FIFTY FOUR BY SENATOR STONE THUNDERSTONE WELCOME. BRENDA FELLOW MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON PRESENTING SP TWELVE FIFTY FOUR WHICH REQUIRE A PHARMACIST AT A HOSPITAL TO CONFIRM AN ACCURATE. MEDICATION PROFILE FOR EACH HIGH RISK PATIENTS UPON ADMISSION OF THE PATIENT. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR. AND HIS COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US ON S. B. TWELVE FIFTY FOUR AND I'M VERY HAPPY. TO BE TAKEN THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TODAY. IT'S STARTING THAT UP 270% OF PATIENTS HAVE ERRORS ON THEIR MEDICATION LISTS UPON ADMISSION TO HOSPITAL. AND UP 259% OF THOSE AREAS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE MODERATE TO SEVERE HARM. THERE'S CURRENTLY A LACK OF OVERSIGHT FOR ENSURING THAT SUCH MEDICAL LISTS ARE ACCURATE UPON HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS. THIS LACK OF DEFINED RESPONSIBILITY RESULTS AND ERRORS IN THE LISTS AND ERRORS IN MEDICATION ORDERS WHEN PATIENTS ARE IN THE HOSPITAL AND IN FACT WHEN THEY'RE DISCHARGED. NOT ONLY DOES IS LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT HARM TO THE PATIENT BUT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THIS PROBLEM ALSO BECAUSE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. DUE TO MEDICATION RELATED PRE ADMISSIONS AND ADVERSE DRUG EVENTS. THIS BILL WERE BETTER ENSURE THE ACCURACY OF WHAT PATIENT MEDICATION PROFILES ARE ADMISSION. THEREBY POTENTIALLY STOPPING ANY ERRORS WHICH WILL ENHANCE PATIENT SAFETY. AND REDUCE POSITION IN HOSPITAL I BILL [inaudible] CHARGE. I WOULD LIKE INTRODUCED DOCTOR RIEDERS CHANGE HE PHARMACY OFFICER FOR CEDAR SINAI HOSPITAL LOS ANGELES AND PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO -- THANK YOU I COULD DRIVE A GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER CENTER COULD JUST PAUSE FOR A MOMENT SO CAN ESTABLISH QUORUM COMMITTEE SIC TRIP. A LITTLE. LOW HERE BROW. ARAMBULA. BAKER. BLOOM [inaudible] CHEN [inaudible] JILL [inaudible] CUNNINGHAM [inaudible] EGGMAN [inaudible] FONG [inaudible] GIPSON [inaudible] GRAYSON [inaudible] HOLDEN [inaudible] IRWIN. MCCARTY MEDINA MULLIN. OBERNOLTE [inaudible] TING. GREAT NOW WE HAVE THE SUBS CORBIN PLEASE. ALLOW UP TO TWO MINUTES PLEASE PRESENT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. HAVEL SENATOR STOTT AND TO THE ASSEMBLY FOR ALLOWING ME TO DISCUSS WHAT I BELIEVE IS A REALLY CRITICAL. A PATIENT SAFETY ISSUE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO I'M GONNA START WITH UP A PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE -- TWENTY YEARS AGO ACTUALLY A LAST MONTH MY FATHER WAS DIAGNOSED WITH LUNG CANCER AND HAD SURGERY IN A SERIES OF NEEDS FOR MEDICATIONS AND AND I WAS KIND OF STARTLED BY SOME OF THE FINDINGS THAN ON HE WAS JUST CONTINUED ON A MEDICATION THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO PREVENT SWELLING. OF HIS BRAIN WHEN HE WAS ON DISCHARGED TO ANOTHER HOSPITAL I THAT THE HOSPITAL DID NOT KNOW THAT HE WAS ON THE MEDICATION WHICH CREATED ALL SORTS OF AND TOWARD SIDE EFFECTS. HE ALSO HAD OTHER -- COMORBIDITY TREATED EFFECTIVELY JUST BECAUSE OF LAPSES IN GETTING AN ACCURATE MEDICATION HISTORY. OF THE I VOWED THEN THAT THIS WOULD BE MY CAREER GOAL TO MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN TO ENSURE THE ACCURACY OF MEDICATION LAST. MANY YEARS LATER MORE RECENTLY MY ELDERLY AND HAD MULTIPLE CONDITIONS AND WAS HOT FREQUENTLY HOSPITALIZED DURING WHAT'S UP ONE HOSPITALIZATION HER ON MEDICATION FOR HER BREAST CANCER WAS DISCONTINUED. SHE WAS STARTED ON MEDICATIONS FOR BLOOD PRESSURE SHE WAS NINETY POUNDS AND THEY KEPT INCREASING THE BLOOD PRESSURE MEDS WHICH IS ALL THAT AND THOUSAND SUBSEQUENT HOSPITALIZATIONS. THAT'S MY PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE FROM MY PROFESSIONS PURPOSE PERSPECTIVE HAVING BEEN A PHARMACIST FOR FOR MANY MANY DECADES I'VE WITNESSED ON THE FACT THAT AND IN THE REAL LIFE SETTING -- THESE MEDICATION LESS WHICH FORM THE BASIS OF ORDERS. ARE CREATED BY NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS AND DIFFERENT PRACTICE SETTINGS ON A DOCTOR'S OFFICE YOU MIGHT HAVE MEDICAL ASSISTANT WHO'S MAYBE HAD FIVE HOURS OF TRAINING IN ORDER ENTRY TAKEN MEDICATION LIST. THAT THEN BECOMES THE BASIS OF FUTURE ORDERS AGAIN THROUGH MY CAREER IN PHARMACY AYE WHAT WITNESS THE EXPLOSION OF COMPLEX NEW MEDICATIONS TO TREAT A VARIETY OF DISEASES WE REALLY HAVE A HUGE OUR MOMENTARY MEDICATIONS AVAILABLE. WE HAVE AN ELDERLY POPULATION MANY TIMES PATIENTS ARE BEING SEEN BY MULTIPLE -- PHYSICIANS AND SO THIS -- THIS AMBIGUITY IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THE MEDICATION LIST AS ACCURATE AS PARTICULARLY AN ISSUE WHEN PATIENTS ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE WHEN THEY'RE ADMITTED TO OUR HOSPITALS. AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR HIGH RISK PATIENTS WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE AS PART OF THE HEALTHCARE TEAM CAN ENSURE THE ACCURACY OF THE MEDICATION LIST. SO THAT THE ORDERS THAT ARE WRITTEN SUBSEQUENTLY ARE BASED ON THE INTENT OF WHAT THE PHYSICIAN DESIRED. SO IN OUR ORGANIZATION WE LOOK AT THIS TEAM BATES APPROACH AS A THREE LEGGED STOOL SO THE PHARMACIST ISRAEL IS THAT IS THE MIDDLE OF THE STORE THE PHYSICIAN IS THE ONE WHO'S DETERMINING THE NEEDS OF THAT PATIENT. THE ACUTE NEEDS TO STABILIZE THAT CREATE A PLAN OF CARE THAT IS TO BE CARRIED OUT BY THE THE OTHER HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS THE PHARMACIST INTERPRETS THAT ORDER IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PATIENT WE'RE NOT REPLACING. ABOUT WITH A PHYSICIAN OR THE NURSES WORK WHERE WHERE THERE AS PART OF THIS THREE LEGGED STOOL. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT WE WE ALL WEEK ALL COMPLETED TRAINING AND IN ENGLISH AND KNOW THAT AND AND HOW TO HOW TO CONSTRUCT A SENTENCE HOW TO CONJUGATE -- OVER AND MEDICATION ORDERS A SENSE OF THE DRUG THE DOES THE ROUTE THE FREQUENCY THE DURATION CRACKED THING WE'RE GONNA SEE HARM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THINK ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COME OF THEM -- MIKE AND NAY METHYLATION IF YOU WISH TO DO SO. MY NAME IS. PAULA AND I SERVICES SECTION CHIEF FOR HOSPITAL MEDICINE AT UC DAVIS MEDICAL CENTER. I ALSO SERVICE THE SITE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR FOR A LARGE COLLABORATIVE TRIAL CALLED THE MARQUEE STUDY -- MEDICATION RECONCILIATION QUALITY IMPROVEMENT STUDY AND THIS IS A LARGE TRIAL INCLUDING OVER EIGHTEEN SITES LOOKING AT BEST PRACTICES IN MEDICATION RECONCILIATION. AND I'LL JUST CUT TO OUR CONCLUSIONS. BASICALLY WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT PHARMACY TECHNICIANS -- GOING ON AND TAKING ACRID PRE ADMISSION MEDICATION LESS WE WERE ABLE TO CUT DOWN MEDICATION DISCREPANCIES OR MEDICATION ERRORS BY OVER 65%. ON AVERAGE PATIENTS THAT SHOWED UP AT OUR INSTITUTION HAD ABOUT FIVE DISCREPANCIES OR MEDICATION ERRORS. PER PATIENT ON ADMISSION WE WERE ABLE TO CUT THAT DOWN TO LESS THAN. ONE SO THE RESULTS WERE QUITE DRAMATIC AND WE'VE. I FOUND THAT -- THESE MEDICATION DISCREPANCIES MEDICATION ERRORS LEAD TO LESS ADVERSE EVENTS -- INCREASED -- SAVINGS IN TERMS OF COST UTILIZATION. SO WE FEEL STRONGLY THAT PHARMACY TECHNICIANS HELPING TO SUPPLEMENT POSITIONS -- REALLY DO OUR PATIENTS LOT OF BENEFIT. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL ONES AS WHICH WAS BEACON SPORT NAY MANIPULATION HE WISHED TO DO SO.

AND I AM NOT SAYING THIS IS THAT THAT'S A NEGATIVE NECESSARILY BUT WERE MORE AND MORE DEPENDENT ON PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS IN OUR HEALTH CARE. SO THIS WOULD ONLY BE A GROWING PROBLEM IN THE IDEA THAT WE MAKE CERTAIN THAT.

I'M S. B. -- FOURTEEN FORTY TWO REQUIRES OF PHARMACIES TO ENSURE -- THAT ANOTHER STAFF MEMBER AYE SUCH AS THE CLERK OR A PHARMACY TECHNICIAN AND IS AVAILABLE TO ASSIST IN THE PHARMACY -- WHENEVER A PHARMACIST IS AT WORK -- OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. SLATE OF AND STRAIGHT OF ACTIONS OF GIVING CALIFORNIA PHARMACISTS. GREATER AND GREATER RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE DIRECT HEALTH CARE SERVICES WHETHER CHECKING -- FOR OPIOID ADDICTION PROVIDING VACCINATIONS OR CONTRACEPTION UNFORTUNATELY PHARMACISTS ARE OFTEN UNABLE TO CARRY OUT THESE DUTIES IN A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE MANNER. OF ALL SIMULTANEOUSLY ANSWERING THE PHONE RINGING UP GROCERIES OR HANDLING A LONG LINE OF IMPATIENT CUSTOMERS ARE WAITING FOR SERVICE. OP PHARMACISTS OFTEN CANNOT EVEN LEAVE TO USE THE RESTROOM WITHOUT SHUTTING DOWN THE PHARMACY I ENTIRELY -- WE ARE AWARE OF PHARMACISTS YOU FOR FOUR SIX OR EVEN AN EIGHT HOUR SHIFT ARE ALONE THE ENTIRE TIME EXPECTED TO RUN EVERYTHING WORK WITH OUT HIS HANDS. AND TIED TO THEIR OWN NEEDS -- AND IT'S REALLY NOT TENABLE -- THIS ISSUE IS PREVALENT -- AT LARGE TEAM RETAIL PHARMACIES AND THAT'S WHAT THE BILL FOCUSES ON ON S. B. FOURTEEN FORTY TWO EXCLUDES HOSPITAL PHARMACIES SMALL MOM AND POP PHARMACIES BECAUSE THAT'S NOT REALLY WHERE THE ISSUE IS -- AND OTHERS WERE REQUIRING PHARMACIST [inaudible] LOS AN ISSUE. S. B. FORTY FORTY TWO IS SUPPORTED BY THE STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY. AMONG OTHER SUPPORTERS AND WILL HELP ENSURE THE PHARMACIST CAN SUCCEED AND PERFORMING THEIR CRITICALLY IMPORTANT HEALTH CARE RESPONSIBILITIES -- I WANT TO THANK US SENATOR STONE UPPER JOINT OFFERING THIS BILL WE DO ENJOY BIPARTISAN A SUPPORT -- AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU'RE UP HERE I GO -- AND I'LL SO GOING -- BY ISAAC MERRETT BE FROM UNITED FOOD COMMERCIAL WORKERS. DO YOU THINK YOU MISUNDERSTOOD YOU WISH TO ADD ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS -- FIRST OF ALL LET ME SAY I'M VERY PROUD -- TO WORK WITH SENATOR WIENER ON THIS BILL. AS MOST OF YOU KNOW I AM A REGISTERED PHARMACIST AND STILL IN GOOD STANDING WITH THE STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY STILL OWN A PHARMACY ALBEIT ACCOUNT COUNTY PHARMACY -- BUT I DID WORK -- FOR CHAIN STORES -- RIGHT AFTER I WAS LICENSE SAVE SOMEONE AFFECT THEIR WORK FOR PHARMACY JOBS TO SAVE ENOUGH MONEY DON'T MY FIRST OF SIX PHARMACIES. IT WAS A BIG DEAL -- AFTER I GRADUATED THAT -- OUR SCOPE OF PRACTICE ACTUALLY INCREASE OR RE COULD LEGALLY TAKE BLOOD PRESSURES AND REPORT TO PATIENT WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAD HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE LOW BLOOD PRESSURE TO GO SEE A POSITION. AND CERTAINLY WE'VE SEEN OVER THE PAST THIRTY FIVE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN A PHARMACIST NOW SHE'S THIRTY SEVEN YEARS. HARD TO BELIEVE HOW FAST TIME GOES BY BUT OUR OUR SCOPE OF PRACTICE IS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AS MANY. A CONSIDER PHARMACIST TO ME THE MOST OVERLY TRAINED UNDER UTILIZE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AS MY COLLEAGUE GOT MENTIONED WE DO US NICOTINE ABATEMENT SERVICES WHICH IS. JUST NOT A SIMPLE IS PULLING OUT A BOX OF NICORETTE OFF THE SHELF AND YOU JUST PRESCRIBING IT AND GIVING IT TO TO A PATIENT -- YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW WHAT THEIR HABIT IS YOU NEED TO HOW MUCH NICOTINE TO GET THEM YOU TO WARN THEM THEY SHOULDN'T SMOKE NICOTINE AT THE SAME TIME THAT THEY'RE CHEWING THE GUM OR PUTTING PATCHES ON IMMUNIZATIONS I MEAN -- VERY SIMPLE QUESTIONS NEED TO BE ASKED THE PATIENTS ARE YOU ALLERGIC TO EGGS BECAUSE THESE IMMUNIZATIONS ARE CULTURED IN EGGS AND IF YOU HAVE AN EGG ALLERGY YOU COULD OF A ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION. SOBRE REQUIRED TO KEEP ADRENALINE THEIR CASE SOMEBODY DOES HAVE AN ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION AND CERTAINLY CONTRACEPTIVES WE NEED TO GET HISTORIES. ALL AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE TO BE FILLING PRESCRIPTIONS. AND AS ASSISTANT PROFESSOR U. S. C. FOR COMMUNITY PHARMACY I ALWAYS MADE SURE MY STE MY STUDENTS WENT THROUGH WHAT I WOULD CALL A TRIPLE CHECK SYSTEM YOU ONLY GET. A FEW MINUTES TO LOOK AT A PRESCRIPTION WHEN YOU'RE OVERSEEING TO TAX YOU HAVE TO OVERSEE EIGHT PATIENT PROFILE. OUGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT SOMEBODY ISN'T SHOPPING PHARMACIES FOR OPIATES WE HAVE AN OP A PROBLEM WE DON'T MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT DISPENSING OPIATES TO PEOPLE THAT ARE. NEEDED TO A GOT A REFILL A WEEK EARLIER THAT SHOULD LASSEN THROUGH THREE WEEKS. SO THIS TREMENDOUS RESPONSIBILITIES ON PHARMACIST TODAY AND IT'S NOT UNCOMMON THAT MANY OF THESE COMPANIES ARE -- PUBLIC COMPANIES AND THEY WANT TO INCREASE DO IT UNFORTUNATELY IS THEY WILL PULL STAFF AWAY. AND WHEN PEOPLE STAFF AWAY THAT MEANS THE PHARMACISTS HAVE TO ANSWER THE PHONES IT IS A PHARMACIST DEL HAS TO GIVE THE IMMUNIZATION. A MEANS OF THE PHARMACIST US TAKE THE ORAL PRESCRIPTION OVER THE PHONE FROM A PHYSICIAN THAT CANNOT BE DONE -- BY TECHNICIAN MUST BE DONE BY THE PHARMACIST AND THEN THE PHARMACISTS HAVE TO CHECK THE WORK. OF THE TECHNICIAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THE APPROPRIATE DRUGS IN THE MODEL THE APPROPRIATE DOSES IN THE BOTTLE THAT THERE'S NOT A DRUG INTERACTION WITH SOMETHING THAT MAYBE THEY'RE ALSO TAKING. AND THIS IS WHY THERE'S A CHALLENGE TODAY THERE'S A REQUIREMENT UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW THE CHECK THAT WAS CALLED A PHARMACIST IN CHARGE. AND MANY EXPERIENCE PHARMACISTS DON'T WANT THAT JOB BECAUSE THEY SEE IT AS A DISASTER IN THE MAKING BECAUSE MISTAKES ARE GOING TO HAPPEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT. AND AND HELP WITH PHARMACISTS SHOULD NOT BE -- RINGING OUT NON PHARMACEUTICAL SALES -- BECAUSE THE LINES ARE ARE TOO BIG AT THE AT THE FRONT OF THE STORE. AYE AYE ONE JUST SHOW YOU ONE LITTLE PIECE OF EVIDENCE MISTER ABOUT CHAIR IF I MAY THIS IS -- THE PUBLIC OR RECORDS REQUEST BY THE STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY JUNE FIRST TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AUGUST THIRTY FIRST TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN THESE ARE ALL. VIOLATIONS. A CHAIN STORES. AND I WOULD ALLEGE. IN APPLYING THAT PROBABLY 80% OF THESE. ARE BECAUSE THE PHARMACIST DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME. TO DO THEIR JOBS. AND THEY WERE WRITTEN VIOLATIONS. AS WELL AS THE PHARMACY AND THEY GO ON PROBATION AND MANY CASES SEE ESPECIALLY YOUNG PHARMACISTS TO COME OUT OF SCHOOL THEY SAY ELECT WILL GIVE A COUPLE BUCKS AN HOUR TO BE THE PHARMACISTS IN CHARGE. AND COMING OUT OF SCHOOL WITH HIGH DEBT SAY SURE WILL TAKE ON THAT RESPONSIBILITY NOT KNOWING THAT. WHILE THEIR HOME IN A PHARMACIST ISN'T DOING THEIR JOB AND THEY MAKE AN ERROR THAT THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE AS WELL FOR THAT. FOR THAT AIR THAT HAPPENED WHEN THEY WERE EVEN IN THE PHARMACY AND THAT'S WHY PHARMACIES ARE HAVING TROUBLE RECRUITING FOR PHARMACISTS IN CHARGE SO. YOU KNOW. AN EXTRA THIRTY SECONDS EXTRA MINUTES IS ENOUGH FOR A PHARMACIST TO BE ABLE TO CHECK THAT BOTTLE AND MAKE SURE THAT THIS MEDICATION THAT'S REQUIRED IN. DOSAGES RIGHT IN THE DIRECTIONS ARE RIGHT THE POSITION IS RIGHT. AND THERE'S NO DRUG INTERACTIONS TO VERY COMPLEX JOB WITH A LOT OF LIABILITY IF THINGS ARE DONE RIGHT. I THINK THIS IS A VERY GOOD SUGGESTION TO HAVE ONE ANCILLARY PERSONNEL -- IN YOUR HERE PROBABLY -- CHAIN STORE SAY WELL WHAT HAPPENS IF WE OPEN THE PHARMACY IN THE MORNING IN THE PHARMACY STAFF DOESN'T SHOW. WELL THAT MEANS OF THE FOR THE MANAGER OF THE STORE CAN TAKE ONE OF THE CASHIERS UP FRONT. THE PUT IN THE PHARMACY YOU CAN'T ILL ANYBODY BY SELLING SOMETHING OVER THE COUNTER AT THE FRONT OF THE STORE WHICH YOU COULD HURT SOMEBODY IF A PHARMACIST AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. TO YOU OUT REAP THE TO REVIEW OF THE WORK THE DISPOSITIVO ACTUALLY FOR THOSE REASONS I STRONGER TONIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR SHOWN UP TO TWO MINUTES PLEASE WHATEVER. THAT YOU MISTER CHAIR. MEMBERS MY NAME IS JIM ARAVINDAN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE US W. S. OR STATES COUNCIL REPRESENT OVER A HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND PRIVATE SECTOR WORKERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

AND APPRECIATED MISTER CHAIR FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THAT IN YOUR WONDERFUL STAFF SO THANK YOU -- SP -- FOURTEEN FORTY EIGHT IS THE PATIENTS RIGHT TWO KNOW ACT OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN IT REQUIRES THAT PHYSICIANS DISCIPLINED BY THE REGULATORY BOARD FOR THE FOLLOWING FOUR CATEGORIES OF MISCONDUCT. WILL HAVE TO NOTIFY THEIR PATIENTS PRIOR TO THEIR VISIT. SEXUAL MISCONDUCT WITH A PATIENT. DRUG ABUSE THAT CAN HARM PATIENTS CRIMINAL CONVICTION INVOLVING HARM TO PATIENTS. AND INAPPROPRIATE PRESCRIBING RESULTING IN PATIENT HARM. PATIENTS WILL FINALLY BE GIVEN INFORMATION THAT'S ALREADY PUBLICLY AVAILABLE SO THEY CAN MAKE. AN INFORMED DECISION ABOUT THEIR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. CURRENTLY DOCTORS HAVE TO NOTIFY THEIR INSURER AND THEIR HOSPITAL OR CLINIC ABOUT THEIR PROBATION STATUS. PATIENTS RECEIVE NOTICE THEY ARE LEFT IN THE DARK AND SUSCEPTIBLE TO FUTURE ABUSE. A STUDY BY THE CALIFORNIA RESEARCH BUREAU. FOUND THAT DOCTORS WHO ENGAGE IN MISCONDUCT ARE 30% MORE LIKELY TO RE OFFEND. THE MEDICAL BOARD PROVOKES THE LICENSES OF ABOUT A HUNDRED AND EIGHT DOCTORS EACH YEAR FOR MISCONDUCT. BUT THEY ALSO NEGOTIATE PROBATION WITH ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR DOCTORS WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO KEEP PRACTICING.

GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS GINA AND PLAN I AM ONE OF OVER THREE HUNDRED WOMEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BY OUR NATIONAL TEAM DOCTOR LEHR NASSER. BEING A VICTIM OF SEXUAL ASSAULT IS NOT A CHOICE I WOULDN'T WISH IT ON MY WORST ENEMY. IS A SAD TRUTH THAT HAS LASTING EFFECTS -- AND WILL TAKE YEARS TO HEAL. I AM AN UNFORTUNATE EXAMPLE OF WHAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN BILLS LIKE THIS ARE NOT PUT IN PLACE AS A VICTIM OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. FROM MY DOCTOR I THINK IT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT AS A PATIENT THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW IF YOUR DOCTOR IS HARM PATIENTS IN THE PAST. I'M HERE TODAY TO ENCOURAGE AND SUPPORT OF THE BILL S. B.. ONE FOUR FOUR EIGHT TRANSPARENCY WHEN IT COMES TO PATIENT DOCTOR RELATIONSHIP IS VITAL. PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE FOR THEMSELVES WHAT THEY WANT TO BE TREATED BY DOCTOR THAT'S PREPARATION.

REBECCA MITCHELL ACT UNEXPECTED MEDICINE COMMITTEE WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THANK YOU. HI JENNIFER SUMMERS OF THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA OR BOARD DID HAVE A SUPPORTIVE AMENDED POSITION ON THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THIS BILL AND BOARD STAFF TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON THE LANGUAGE CURRENTLY IN THIS BILL. AM HOWEVER THIS BILL DOES NARROW M. TO SPECIFIC CATEGORIES BUT THEY'RE NOT EXACTLY THE SAME AS WHAT THE BOARD REQUESTED SO. AND WE DID WORK WITH EVERYONE ON THE ON THE LANGUAGE AND WILL BRING IT BACK TO OUR BOARD AND I MEAN UNTIL I THINK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AT THIS TIME. SINGLE ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUALS WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COME UP TO THE PODIUM. PLEASE FEEL FREE PRESENT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. IF YOU MISTER CHAIR NUMBERS MAKE IT ALRIGHT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION UNFORTUNATELY STILL IN OPPOSITION TO THE SENATE BILL. FOURTEEN FORTY EIGHT WHILE WE APPRECIATE ALL OF THE MOVEMENT THAT HAS HAPPENED ON THIS BILL AND ALL OF THE DILIGENT WORK OF THE AUTHOR THERE'S ONE OUTSTANDING AMENDMENT. REGARDING DISCLOSURE OFFELONIES THAT INVOLVE PATIENT HARM VERSUS MISDEMEANORS WE BELIEVE THAT THE AMENDMENT WILL STRIKE THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN INFORMING PATIENTS IN INTERFERING WITH PATIENT CARE. AND WITHOUT A MOMENT I WOULD BE ABLE TO REMOVE OPPOSITION BUT AT THIS TIME WE WILL STICK REMAIN OPPOSED THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WOODS IS WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME. SEE NO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS ASSEMBLY WOMAN BAKER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SENATOR HELL -- I HAVE SEEN VERSIONS OF THIS ISSUE A COUPLE TIMES BUT A SPECIAL THANK YOU TO YOUR WITNESSES. AFTER COMING VERY MUCH A WORKING WITH THE SENATOR ON THIS IN THIS ISSUE AND MANY OTHERS THAT WILL. CONTINUE TO COME UP AS WE LEARN HOW WE AS A COMMITTEE CAN BETTER PROTECT PEOPLE FROM PREDATORS LIKE DOCTOR NASSER. AND SO THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT AND AND STAINING GAUGED AYE I'M HAVE BUT THE QUESTION THE COMMENT THE QUESTION IS JUST TO THE SPECIFIC AMENDMENT THAT THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HAS REYES. ARE YOU STILL IN DISCUSSIONS -- AREA THAT YOU FEEL IS WORTH LOOKING AT IF NOT WHAT ABOUT THAT AMENDMENT MIGHT MAKE YOU CHOOSE TO NOT TAKE IT BOOK THINKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH A ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAKER THE THE THE THAT THE AMENDMENT THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR THEIR OPPOSITION IS IS WRAPPED AROUND ONE ISSUE. ANDTHAT IS IN OUR BILL TALKS ABOUT CRIMINAL CONVICTION INVOLVING HARM TO PATIENTS. UP WE CONSIDER ANY. TYPE OF CONVICTION THAT HARMS A PATIENT SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN NOTIFICATION. WITH THEY WANT IS JUST FELONY CONVICTIONS WELL IN MANY CONVICTIONS MAY BE A FELONY OF OF WOULD BE CHARGES OF FELONY AND PLAYED DOWN TO A MISDEMEANOR AND IF I COULD GIVE YOU A COUPLE EXAMPLES. THAT WOULD NOT BE INCLUDED IN THEIR DEFINITION ONE IS -- ANONYMOUS TELEPHONE CALLS PERSON PLAYED DOWN FROM ANNOYING OR MOLESTING A MINOR CHILD. TO TO THAT TO ANONYMOUS TELEPHONE CALLS BECAUSE THEY RID THE DOCTOR WAS HARASSING AN UNDER AGE CHILD AND PARENT. I THINK THAT'S PATIENT HARM POSSESSION OF A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE WITHOUT A PRESCRIPTION THAT'S WHAT THE DOCTOR HAD. WELL THAT WAS PLAYED DOWN TO A MISDEMEANOR BUT THEY WERE GOING TO GIVE THEY WERE GIVING THE PATIENT THOSE SUBSTANCES THAT WERE CONTROLLED. A ASSAULT WAS PLAYED DOWN TO A MISDEMEANOR. WELL ASSAULT IT WAS ASSAULT AGAINST A PATIENT. A OF TRAINING CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES THROUGH FRAUD DECEIT OR MISREPRESENTATION. THAT WOULD BE YOU WOULDN'T THINK THERE BE PATIENT HARM BUT THAT OBTAINING THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES WERE GIVEN TO PATIENTS. L. USING A CONCEALED CAMCORDER TO SECRETLY VIDEOTAPE A PERSON IN A PLACE WHERE THE PERSON. HAS A REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY THAT WAS THE CHARGE OF AS A MISDEMEANOR. THAT WAS HARMING A PATIENT BECAUSE THEY WERE FILMING A PATIENT. IN THE ROOM PETTY IN GRAND THEFT RELATING TO HEALTH CARE. SOME SEPARATE FROM THAT BUT THEY WERE STEALING FROM A PATIENT. SO THAT'S WHY WE FELT THAT IT'S IMPORTANT REGARDLESS OF FELONY OR MISDEMEANOR. ALL CRIMINAL ACTIVITY THAT SHOWS IT INDICATES A HARM TO PATIENTS I UNDERSTAND AND I AM I AGREE WITH YOU THERE -- THERE ARE SO MANY MISDEMEANORS THAT ARE -- ONES THAT I THINK PATIENTS WOULD WANT TO KNOW ABOUT. AND ONE IS THAT IF YOU'RE A MANDATED REPORTER AND YOU KNEW ABOUT THE CSUS ARE YOU SUSPECTED POTENTIAL ABUSE OF SOMEONE YOU'RE MANDATED TO TELL -- LAW ENFORCEMENT AND IF YOU DON'T IT'S A MISDEMEANOR AND A FINE OF THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS VERY PERTINENT TO THE LARRY NASSER CASON. AND OTHER CASES -- IN AYE I'M IS SUPPORT THIS AND AND I THINK ONE OF THINGS I'M REALLY PLEASED TO SEE IS THAT. YOU HAVE MADE IT A MUCH MORE NARROW PROVISION THAT WHAT PRIOR EFFORTS TO DISCLOSE TO PATIENTS PROBATION STATUS HAVE BEEN. NOT ONLY SUBJECT MATTER LIKE POTENTIAL OF WE WHICH ARE PRACTICES AND POTENTIAL PATIENT HARM AS OPPOSED TO SOMETIMES -- A PERSON TO BE PUT ON PROBATION IN DIFFERENT FIELDS OF PRACTICE BECAUSE THEY'RE BACK ON THEIR TAXES OR THEY HAVE -- SPOUSAL SUPPORT OBVIOUSLY THINK THOSE ARE BAD THINGS BUT VERY IF A PROPOSED OUT PROVOKES SAYS SENTIMENT IT -- YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO CARE FOR NATION MIGHT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PRACTICE AND SCOPES TIME I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'VE MADE IT MORE NARROW IN THAT RESPECT. AND SECONDLY THAT THE PROVISION. THAT MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS AN INDIVIDUAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE PATIENT AND THE DOCTOR. AB PRIOR EFFORTS TO JUST PAINT A BROAD BRUSH AND SEE IF YOU'RE ON PROBATION AFTER. POSTED IN THIS WAY AND IT COULD BE ABOUT SOMETHING TOTALLY UNRELATED DIDN'T HELP THAT CONVERSATION BETWEEN A DOCTOR AND A PATIENT WHERE THE PATIENT CAN BE EMPOWERED TO MAKE THE DECISION. OKAY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S RELEVANT TO WHETHER OR NOT I I WANT TO CONTINUE TO SEE THIS POSITION OR I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE. I STILL WANT TO SEE THIS POSITION AND I APPRECIATE THAT -- IT'S NOT PERFECT I THINK THERE ARE SOME YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T HAPPEN OFTEN HAVE PERFECT BILLS BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU ARE TENACIOUS ABOUT THIS AND FOCUSED ON THESE TWO AREAS WHERE. PRIOR EFFORTS HAVE BEEN TOO BROAD AND HAVE ACTUALLY I THINK UNDERMINES. THE INFORMATION THAT'S VALUABLE GOING TO A PATIENT SO I'M PLEASED TO SUPPORT AND I I HOPE IT GOES FORWARD I I DO OF COURSE ALWAYS ENCOURAGED HIM. TO WORK WITH THOSE WHO ARE MOST AFFECTED IN THE PHYSICIAN'S PRACTICE BY THE CONCERNS -- IF IF THERE'S A WAY TO REACH -- ADDITIONAL AGREEMENT ON THE SCOPE OF HOW YOU DEFINE THIS CONVICTIONS OR VOTE BUT IS MOST USEFUL FOR PATIENTS TO HAVE -- I'D STRONGLY ENCOURAGE CONTINUE TO DO THAT THANK YOU -- FOR MAKING THOSE CHANGES AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME. SEE NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM CONSUMERS AT THIS TIME CENTER TO HELP YOU WISH TO CLOSE AYE. IP APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION AND I APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT -- AND WE DID THERE ARE THE BILL CONSIDERABLY IN IN. NARRATIVE WITH THE FOCUS OF PATIENT HARM. THAT REALLY IS THE CRITERION THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR AND THE THAT AND WHAT REALLY MADE THE DIFFERENCE IT. I MEAN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DU Y.. IF IF IF A PHYSICIAN WERE TO GET A D. WHY THAT IS SERIOUS. THAT IS REPORTABLE TO THE TO THE MEDICAL BOARD. BUT THAT DIDN'T IN LESS THAT DO YOU AYE AFFECTED A PATIENT IT SHOULD NOT BE PART OF THE DISCLOSURE. A AND THAT'S HOW WE WE INTERPRETED AND THAT'S HOW WE KNOW WHAT KIND OF FOCUSED DID AND THE OF FUNNELED VIA THE APPROACH FOR DIRECTLY PATIENT I RESPECTFULLY ASK DR MEMBERS AND AGAIN THANK YOU. TO A TWO YEAR CHAIR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP IN THIS AND THAT AND YOUR STAFF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR AND I WANT TO REAFFIRM THEIR COMMITMENT AND ONGOING COMMUNICATIONS WITH NOT ONLY WITH OUR OFFICES BUT DIRECTLY FROM ARE SENATE COUNTERPARTS.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. SEEING NO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES VERSION IS PICKING SUPPORT ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COME UP TO THE PODIUM IF YOU CAN KIND OF MAKE SOME ROOM. PLEASE FEEL FREE TO PRESENT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY -- THANK YOU MATTER THAT MISTER CHAIR. MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE ON RUN KINGSTON I REPRESENT FOR REGIONAL APARTMENT ASSOCIATIONS. EAST BAY RENTAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION. PARTICIPATION ORANGE COUNTY. NORTH VALLEY APARTMENT ASSOCIATION AND PART MISSUS USUALLY ORANGE COUNTY. SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF THIS BILL WE HAVE MET WITH THE AUTHOR -- HIS STAFF ON INNUMERABLE OCCASIONS. I WE HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY EVEN TO SPEAK WITH YOUR STAFF AT GREAT LENGTH MISTER CHAIRMAN -- ABOUT OUR SPECIFIC CONCERNS THERE NOT UNRESOLVABLE. BUT THEY'RE VERY VERY IMPORTANT. THERE'S NO QUESTION IN MY MIND. SENSELESS DEATH IS SENSELESS DEATH WHETHER YOU FALL OFF A BALCONY OR ANY OTHER PURPOSE. WE ARE NOT WE ARE NOT LOOKING AT THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE PRACTICALITY OF IMPLEMENTING. AND MAKING SENSE OF A STATEWIDE MANDATORY INSPECTION PROGRAM. OF ALL RESIDENTIAL RENTAL UNITS I PERSONALLY DON'T SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CONDOMINIUM UNIT THAT IS FIVE STORIES TALL OR AN APARTMENT THAT IS FIVE STORIES TALL THAT HASSA. DECKED BALCONY A PORCH -- AND BUT THAT'S AND THAT'S A DISCUSSION OF ANOTHER DAY. THERE FIVE ISSUES I WANT TO PRESENT TO YOU TODAY THAT HAVE NOT BEEN RESOLVED THAT ARE VERY VERY MATERIAL AND VERY SUBSTANTIVE [inaudible] FIRST -- HAD. WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO DIRECTOR UNIT UNDER SPECIFIC LAW. I WE HAVE ACCESS TO A RENTAL UNIT TO SHOW UP FOR SALE FOR LEAKS -- EVEN -- TO MAINTAIN BUT NOT TO INSPECT IS A SHORTCOMING WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS. IN THAT THIS BILL SHOULD DO THEIR SECOND. THIS IS A VERY VERY BIG ISSUE THE BILL SAYS THE INSPECTION IS TO BE DONE ON 15% OF UNIT. I GUESS TO BE INSPECTED -- OR TO BE DETERMINED BY THE INSPECTOR. AND OF THE 15% BUT WHEN THE INSPECTOR IS LOOKING AT THE DARK FALCON ES THE PORCH. WHERE THAT ATTACH IS TO THE WALL? EVERY INSPECTOR HAVING ANY QUALITY AND ANY -- EDUCATION WILL. WILL SAY THIS IS GOING TO BE AN THE REPORT BECAUSE THAT. SPECTOR'S GOT TO KNOW HOW THE DECKED THE BALCONY THE PORCH IS ATTACHED TO THE WALL IS IT SAFE TO AS BY THE PREVIOUS WITNESS POINTED OUT. ABOUT -- WOOD FRAME BUILDINGS ETCETERA. WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE INVASIVE NATURE OF V. INSPECTION IN THE INSPECTIONS WILL CALL FOR FURTHER -- FURTHER INVASIVECAN ADD DESTRUCTIVE TECHNIQUES. I TO MAKE THIS DETERMINATION WE BELIEVE THAT IT SHOULD BE ONLY BASED ON EVIDENCE ON THE OUTSIDE THAT THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG. ON THE INSIDE OF THE WALL. THREE THERE'S NO APPEAL TO THIS -- TO THIS BILL. INSPECTOR GUM OPINES HERE'S THE REPORT WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO APPEAL OR JUST YOU [inaudible] WHAT? WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE VERY SPECIFICALLY THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IDENTIFIED BY ANY? OF THE INSPECTION ITEMS. THERE'S ALWAYS A RIGHT TO APPEAL BUT THIS BILL DOESN'T -- ADDRESS IT AS YET [inaudible] NEXT -- WE HAVE TO DISCLOSE EVERY INSPECTION THAT IS BUT BEEN DONE IN ETERNITY IT SAYS FOR SIX YEARS BUT THEN IT. ARE OR TWO SIX YEAR INSPECTION CYCLES. BUT WHAT REALLY SHOULD HAPPEN. IS THAT IT SHOULD BE FOR ONE CYCLE AND LETS OF VALUE WAITED WHAT WE OF WEEK RESPECTFULLY IF REQUESTED. IS BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME. EVER STATEWIDE MANDATORY INSPECTION OF ALL THESE TAX. BALCONIES PORCHES AND EVERYONE'S DISTRICTS -- THAT. WE SHOULD COME BACK AND EVALUATE. IF THE HOW EFFECTIVE -- THE TERMS OF MISTER HILLS BILL IS. AND FINALLY [inaudible] THE WHEN THE INSPECTION. IS OPINED AND IT'S WRITTEN NOW. HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE SOLD A HOUSE OR PROPERTY? WITH THE AIR CONDITIONERS FIX. THE OVEN IS FIXED. EVERYTHING IS FIXED DO YOU DISCLOSE DO YOU HAVE AN AFFIRMATIVE DUTY. TO DISCLOSE THAT TO A BUYER NO BECAUSE IT'S NOT BROKEN ANYMORE IT'S BEEN REPAIRED IT'S BEEN REPLACED. YET THIS BILL ENVISIONS. THAT THE PREVIOUS INSPECTIONS THERE HAVE IDENTIFIED A PROBLEM. EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE BEEN CORRECTED YOU STILL HAVE TO DISCLOSE THIS IS A MATERIAL DEPARTURE. FROM -- DISCLOSURE OBLIGATION FROM A SELLER TO A BUYER I'VE NOT SEEN THAT EVER IN OF REAL PROPERTY. IT'S CLOSE UNLESS. THE BUYER SAYS. TO MISTER MULLIN MISTER MULLIN. AT HAVE YOU EVER REPLACE THE AIR CONDITIONER V. EVER REPLACE THIS REVIEW REPAIR THE TACK YOU HAVE AN AFFIRMATIVE DUTY.

THE USE OF AND I TEND WHEN APPLYING FOR A TEACHER WHO ENJOYS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN ALLOWING OUR IMMIGRANT POPULATION TO APPLY TO TEACH IN THE STATE. COUNTY CALIFORNIA'S EXPERIENCING A MASSIVE TEACHER SHORTAGE ESPECIALLY IN CERTAIN AREAS SUCH AS BILINGUAL EDUCATION THIS BILL ENSURES THAT EXPERIENCE IMMIGRANT TEACHERS INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED FIVE THOUSAND TEACHERS WITH DOCTOR STATUS. CAN CONTINUE TO TEACH IN THE STATE. UNLIKE THE CTC THE DEPARTMENT OF HOPE. THIRTY CURRENTLY DID NOT ALLOW IMMIGRANTS WITHOUT A SECURITY TO APPLY FOR MANY LICENSES AND CERTIFICATES CERTIFICATES IN THEIR PURVIEW THIS BILL MAKES A SMALL TECHNICAL CHANGE IN THE CODE. IN ORDER TO ALLOW IMMIGRANTS TO APPLY FOR MANY OF THE LICENSES UNDER THE PURVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THE BILL ALSO EXPANDS OPPORTUNITIES TO MANY MORE PROFESSIONS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING SHORTAGES INCLUDING CERTIFIED NURSE ASSISTANTS AND HOME HEALTH AIDE THE USE OF IT I TEND WHEN APPLYING FOR A LICENSE PROVIDES. THE SAME STANDARD OF INFORMATION TO LICENSING ENTITIES WITHIN THE HEALTH CARE SPHERE ENTITIES CAN CHECK A GOOD MORAL CHARACTER OF AN APPLICANT AS WELL AS A TAX COMPLIANCE.
