TWENTY NINETEEN THESE THAT THESE THIRTY TWO DELEGATES BEHIND ME ARE STRONG WILLED BILLION AND PERCEPTIVE. THEIR PASSION FOR EDUCATION AND A DESIRE TO ACTIVELY WORK FOR CHANGE INSPIRES NOT ONLY ME BUT THE STAFF BEHIND ME. WITH NO BIAS OR GUIDING FROM ANY OF STAFF MEMBERS THIS YEAR'S DELEGATES DEBATED VOTED AND DECIDED ON FOR TOPICS THAT WILL BE PRESENTING TODAY. STUDENT INVOLVEMENT SCHOOL FINANCES GENDER NON CONFORMING INCLUSIVITY CURRICULUM REFORM AND SEXUAL ASSAULT SUPPORT AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT EDUCATION. IN ADDITION THE LEGISLATIVE POLICY COMMITTEE OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF STUDENT COUNCILS HAVE DEVELOPED THE PROPOSAL ON STATE FUNDING. ON DAY ONE MONDAY THESE DELEGATES FLUNG THEMSELVES INTO A LONG BRAINSTORMING PROCESS THAT OVER THE COURSE OF TWO DAYS HAVE BEEN COMPRESSED INTO FORCES THING PROPOSALS. WE WORK LONG HOURS INTO THE NIGHT LAYING OUT A FOUNDATION FOR THE PROPOSAL VIA ROUTE PROBLEMS ASSUMPTIONS CAUSES AND EVIDENCE. THE DELEGATES BUT UNDERSTAND ATTIC KNOWLEDGE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN STATE AND LOCAL POLICY IDEAS HAVE KEPT THIS TO MY WHEN EVALUATING ALL POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS FOR THE FOUR TOPICS.

THANK YOU MR CAM. LIKE TO INVITE UP OUR FIRST PANEL. I THINK UNDERSCORE FINANCES INSTILLS SIENNA BOGART AND STEPHEN CAM ARE STEPPING CAM WELCOME. GOOD MORNING HONORABLE CHAIRWOMAN LEYVA CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND STAFF MEMBERS MY NAME IS IAN CELLS AND I'M A SENIOR SME HIGH SCHOOL IN HOLLISTER CALIFORNIA. AND MY NAME IS STEVEN KIM AND I'M A SENIOR THIRTY WAS HIGH SCHOOL IN FORCE IN CALIFORNIA AND MY NAME SANTA BURGER AND I'M A SENIOR AT NEWARK WHILE HIGH SCHOOL IN YOUR CALIFORNIA. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS RECEIVED A TOTAL OF NINETY SEVEN POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS. IN FUNDING FROM STATE LOCAL AND FEDERAL SOURCES. THAT'S LIKE EVERY PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENT IN CALIFORNIA WINNING A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR LUMP SUM. YET STUDENTS HAVE VERY LIMITED TO NO INPUT ON HOW THEIR LOCAL DISTRICTS ALLOCATE THIS TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN OUR IDEAL SCHOOL DISTRICT STUDENTS. HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD. MY ADMINISTRATORS AND ALL DECISIONS THAT WOULD IMPACT THEIR EDUCATION. OVER THE COURSE OF THE PAST FEW DAYS MY FELLOW STUDENTS AND I HAVE FOUND THAT CURRENTLY. ONLY A SINGULAR PERSPECTIVE EXISTS ON THE DISCUSSION SURROUNDING DISTRICTS FINANCIAL DECISIONS. THIS LIKE A STUDENT INVOLVEMENT. AND INPUT AND BUDGET PUTS A STRAIN ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ADMINISTRATION AND STUDENTS. PUSHING THEM ONTO THE TWO DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE SAME BY. A LACK OF STUDENT INPUT AND BUDGET COMMITTEES IS A MISSED OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDENTS TO UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITIES OF SCHOOL FINANCING FOR DISTRICTS TO BE BETTER CONNECTED WITH THE NEEDS OF THEIR MAIN CONSTITUENTS. THUS WE RECOMMEND THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY AND SURE THE INCLUSION OF STUDENT REPRESENTATION AND DISTRICT BUDGETING ADVISING COMMITTEES DEMANDING THE CREATION OF BUDGET ADVISORY COMMITTEES OUR BACKS. THIS YEAR B THE BOARD A LEGISLATION IN EDUCATION PROPOSES THAT THE STATE LEGISLATOR OVERSEE THE CREATION OF STUDENT COMMITTEES. IN ORDER TO ADVISE THEIR STUDENT BOARD MEMBER AS WELL AS FOR BY THE STUDENT PERSPECTIVE TO THE SUPERINTENDENT ON THE DISTRICT'S BUDGET THROUGH PRESENTATIONS AT SCHOOL BOARD MEETINGS. HE'S JUST HEARD BACK WOULD BE RUN BY THE ALREADY ESTABLISHED STUDENT BOARD MEMBER POSITION AND PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THIS CONNECTION WOULD ALLOW FOR THE BACK TO EXIST AS ONE A BOARD OF STUDENTS TO PROVIDE THEIR PERSPECTIVE ON THE DISTRICT BUDGET ISSUES AND TO A STUDENT RESOURCE FOR STUDENT BOARD MEMBERS TO STAY CONNECTED WITH THEIR LARGE CONSTITUENT AREA. ESSENTIALLY ARE BACK PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE ESSENTIAL STUDENT INPUT ON BUDGETARY ISSUES AND CONSTITUENT CONNECTION. FOR THE DISTRICTS YOU IMPORTANT FOR THIS AFFECTED THE WOULD REMEDY THE ISSUE OF THE LACK OF STUDENT INPUT WITHIN SCHOOL DISTRICTS FINANCING ACROSS ALL STATE BALTIC. AS MY COLLEAGUE HAS STATED CREATING DISTRICT BUDGETING ADVISORY COMMITTEES WOULD CREATE A PLATFORM FOR STUDENTS THE MAIN STAKEHOLDER IN PUBLIC EDUCATION. TO COMMENT ON FUNDING ALLOCATION AND TO ADDRESS PRIORITIES THEY SEE IN CERTAIN AREAS. WE RECOGNIZE THAT PRESENTLY CERTAIN AVENUES TO EXIST FOR STUDENT INPUT AND ONE PART OF THE ALLOCATION. PROCESS THERE IS A SHORT PROVISION IN SECTION ONE OF THE LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN. THAT REQUIRES STUDENT INPUT HOW THE LANGUAGE AND INVOLVED IN SECTION ONE OF THE CAP. IS FAIRLY AMBIGUOUS AND BECAUSE OF THIS NOT CONSISTENTLY IMPLEMENTED THROUGHOUT ALL OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DISTRICTS. ACCORDING TO THE CDC ONLY SEVEN OUT OF THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. HAVE SOME FORM OF STUDENT COMMITTEE TO ALLOW INPUT IN THEIR SCHOOLS BUDGETS. HOWEVER IN THE FEW SO I CASES WERE BUDGET DECISIONS INVOLVE STUDENTS SUCH AS IN THE CAP. THERE APPEARS TO BE GREAT SUCCESS. IS BECAUSE OF THIS DEMONSTRATE SUCCESS THAT WE WANT THE BUDGET ADVISORY COMMITTEES TO BE A FURTHER STEP INCORPORATING SOON INVOLVEMENT IN BUDGET PROCESSES AT THE HIGHER DISTRICT LEVEL. AN EXAMPLE OF INNOVATION CAN BE SEEN IN THE KERN HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT IN BAKERSFIELD CALIFORNIA. WHERE THERE EXISTS A NON MANDATED EL CAP ADVISORY COMMITTEE? IT IS IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS COMMITTEE IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE ONE THAT IS NOT WIDESPREAD AND ONE THAT IS UNIQUE IN ITS EXISTENCE. AN EXAMPLE OF ITS SUCCESS STUDENTS WERE ABLE TO ADVOCATE FOR AND BE INFORMED ON A IN BE INFORMED ON A LOW INCOME SUMMER FOOD PROGRAM. CONDUCTED BY THE SCHOOL OF CUT FUNDING. THE ABILITY FOR STUDENTS UNDERSTAND WE'RE SCHOOL FUNDS WERE ALLOCATED COUPLED WITH A PLATFORM FOR STUDENT FEEDBACK ALLOWED FOR THE GREAT SUCCESS OF THIS LOW INCOME SUMMER FOOD PROGRAM. IN THE CURRENT HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT WE OBSERVED THAT STUDENTS WERE ABLE TO ENGAGE WITH ADMINISTRATORS IN A UNIQUE WAY. AND TRULY COMPREHEND THE DISTRIBUTION OF EL CAP FUNDS THROUGH THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE. ONCE AGAIN IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT IN THIS SITUATION STUDENTS ARE NOT INVOLVED IN THE ENTIRETY OF THE DISTRICT BUDGET. BUT ONLY THE LIMITED FUNDS UNDER THE EL CAP LEAVE THAT THE SUCCESSES THAT SHE FROM STUDENT INPUT IN THE EL CAP COULD BE AMPLIFIED IF STUDENTS WERE ABLE TO OVERSEE DISTRICT THE ENTIRETY OF THE DISTRICT BUDGET. ED THROUGH A PROPOSAL THIS IS ENTIRELY PLAUSIBLE ALREADY IN GARDEN GROVE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT TO REPRESENTATIVES FROM ALL THE DISTRICT'S SCHOOLS CONVENE IN A MONTHLY MEETING. WITH THE DISTRICT STUDENT BOARD MEMBER AND SUPERINTENDENT. HERE THE SUPERINTENDENT ADDRESSES THE STUDENTS INDIVIDUAL AND COMMUNITY ISSUES ARE FOR DIRECT TO A COMMUNICATION. ALLOWING FOR FACILITATION OF PROBLEM SOLVING AND UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES. THIS OPEN A PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSION RESOLVED OUR CONCERN OF A DISTANCE ADMINISTRATION BY AUGUST STUDENTS TO HAVE THEIR CONCERNS HEARD AND PERIMETER SHOOTERS TO BOTH HERE THESE CONCERNS. ADDRESS THEM. AS A RESULT SUITS ARE MORE INVESTED INTO THE DISTRICT AND ITS FINANCIAL WELL BEING. IT'S A WIN WIN FOR STUDENTS EDITORS AT THEIR DISTRICTS. THE BIG TO STUDENT VOICE IN BUDGET DECISIONS GARDEN GROVE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND FOR STUDENTS ABOUT THE PROPOSED BUDGET IN THESE MEETINGS. THESE MEETINGS UTILIZE THE SAME SYSTEM OF PRODUCING CONVERSATION BETWEEN THIS YEAR REPRESENTATIVES THE CITY BOARD MEMBER. AND THE SUPERINTENDENTS ALONG FOR A MULTIPLICITY OF PERSPECTIVES AND PERMANENT FEEDBACK OF THE BUDGETS MOST IMPORTANT STAKEHOLDERS. THE STUDENTS THEMSELVES. I MUST REMEMBER MANY THE SUPERINTENDENTS WERE ONCE HE SEES. INSTRUCTORS OF THE PEOPLE THE CURRENTLY SIR. BUT WITH DAILY POLITICS CASA NEGOTIATION. AND EVERYDAY ADULT LIFE. IT'S EASY TO SEE WHY STUDENTS CAN BE OVERLOOKED IN THE LIVES OF THESE BUSY INDIVIDUALS. THIS COMMITTEE PROVIDE THE REINTRODUCTION OF STUDENTS AND THEIR VERY REAL VERY LEGITIMATE PERSPECTIVES INTO THE MIND OF THE SCHOOL BOARD. THOUGH NOT VOTING MEMBERS STUDENTS INSIDE PROVED TO BE INVALUABLE CONSIDERATIONS FOR BOARD MEMBERS AND ADMINISTRATORS. WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR PROPOSAL BOARD MEMBERS DECISIONS WILL BE OBJECTIVELY AND CONSISTENTLY INFORMED. BY THIS COMMITTEE AND THE RELEVANT INSIGHTS. I BY CAN SUMMARIZE THIS PROPOSAL INTO ONE SENTENCE. BUT IT BE THIS. STUDENTS IN THE ADVOCACY IN BUDGET PLANS THROUGH STUDENT. ADVISORY COMMITTEES WE ARE THE STUDENTS BELIEVE ARE PLACES IN THESE BUDGETING COMMITTEES AS WE OFTENTIMES FUEL LOST AMONG THE CONFUSING ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES. AND LACK OF SUPPORT FOR WHAT WE NEED MOST. THERE'S REALLY NOTHING STOPPING THE CREATION OF THESE COMMITTEES. FOR YOUR LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY AT DISTRICTS WILLINGNESS TO COOPERATE. BY SUPPORTING THE CREATION OF THESE COMMITTEES ACROSS OUR STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE FUTURE DEMOCRACY IN OUR EDUCATION. WERE INFORMED ADULTS AND CONCERN STUDENTS COME TOGETHER TO USE THEIR MONETARY AN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE MANNER. WE LIKE TO THANK YOU EACH FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION BAR POSITION. I WOULD NOW LIKE TO OPEN UP THE FLOOR IT'S YOUR CONSTANT QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS VERY COMPREHENSIVE MEMBERS ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER SMITH. WELL I CONGRATULATE YOU ON WHAT IS A PHENOMENAL PROPOSAL IT'S GREAT FOR ME AS A LEGISLATOR TO KNOW THAT ALL OF THE INTENT OF OUR EL CAP PROCESS WAS TO ENGAGE ALL STAKEHOLDERS -- IN THE BUDGETING FOR A DISTRICT THAT THAT WE ARE FALLING SHORT THERE SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR DILIGENCE IN YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS. DID YOU GIVE ANY CONSIDERATION TO STUDENT REPRESENTATION ON BOND OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES AS WELL OR DID YOU LIMIT. AND SIMPLY TO THAT THE OVERALL DISTRICT INSIDE BUDGETS -- YOU'RE MORE LOOKING AT THE DISTRICTS THEMSELVES BECAUSE MOST OF THE CONTROL IS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL NOT REALLY LOOKING TOO MUCH AT THESE LIKE BOARD GRANTS CAM. OKAY WELL PHENOMENAL WORK I APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. I'M CURIOUS -- IS THERE ANYTHING SPECIFIC THAT YOU HAVE SEEN IN THE EL CAP BUDGET THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE OR YOU JUST LIKE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE THERE AND SEE HOW THE MONEY IS BEING ALLOCATED. MMHM OVER -- EXISTING THROUGH THE EL CAP EIGHT IS A LITTLE AMBIGUOUS AND INVOLVES ON REQUIRE -- INVOLVEMENT FROM THE COMMUNITY AND ONE OF THOSE IF THAT TERMS I AGREE I APOLOGIZE WELL INTO THE POLICE FOR INVOLVEMENT IS I STUDENT INVOLVEMENT IN THAT IT LEAVES IT AT THAT. WHICH ISN'T VERY COMPREHENSIVE AND I COULD BE AS SIMPLE AS A SCHOOL HAVING STUDENTS SIGN OFF ON A PIECE OF PAPER SAYING THAT THEY UDERSTAND EL CAP AND THAT YOU INVOLVED THE STUDENT. SO WE WERE HOPING THAT THROUGH THIS EVEN THOUGH NOT ONLY SPECIFIC TO THE OIL CAP. TO THE ENTIRETY OF THE DISTRICT BUDGET THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO INVOLVE STUDENTS IN THAT MANNER. GOOD VERY GOOD WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH EXCELLENT PRESENTATION AND WILL CALL FOR NEXT PANEL. THANK YOU. SO OUR NEXT PANEL IS NON BINARY GENDER INCLUSIVITY. KILEY CHAUDRY KHLOE MADDEN AND RAY PARKER COME ON UP. WELCOME WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE YOU HERE. WHOEVER YOU WOULD LIKE TO GO FIRST PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING AUDIBLE CHAIRWOMAN LEYVA CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL AND TO SEE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY COMMITTEES ON EDUCATION. NAME IS CALL HIM OUT IN AND I'M A JUNIOR CREEL HIGH SCHOOL AND THE GUITAR OR IN A PARK UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. MY NAME IS KILEY CHAUDRY AND I'M A SENIOR AT MIDDLE COLLEGE HIGH SCHOOL AND THE LARA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. MY NAME IS RAY PARKER AND I'M A SOPHOMORE CREATE A HIGH SCHOOL IN THE COULD TADI RUNNER PARK UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WELCOME. I SIT HERE TODAY AS A NON BINARY STUDENTS. SOMEONE WHOSE GENDER IDENTITY DOES NOT MATCH MALE OR FEMALE. I REPRESENT THE OTHER NON BINARY STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA WHEN I ASK THAT ALL SCHOOLS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE A GENDER NEUTRAL BATHROOM THAT IS EASILY ACCESSIBLE TO ALL STUDENTS. I SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THESE NON BINARY STUDENTS TO FEEL INVALIDATED BY OUR CURRENT LACK OF GENDER NEUTRAL RESTROOM FACILITIES. SCHOOL SHOULD BE A COMPLETELY INCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR ALL PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF GENDER IDENTITY. A PLACE WHERE GENDER NEUTRAL RESTROOMS ARE JUST AS EASILY ACCESSIBLE AS MALE OR FEMALE RESTROOMS. IN MY IDEAL SCHOOL PREFERRED PRONOUNS IN NAMES ARE NOT ONLY RESPECTED BUT ACCOUNTED. FOR AND GENDER NON CONFORMING USE EEL REPRESENTED REPRESENTED AND VALUED WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITY. AS A SOCIETY WE HAVE MADE TREMENDOUS STRIDES AND ACCEPTING NON BINARY GENDER IDENTITIES THE STATE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY HAVE FURTHER THIS PROGRESSION IN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS. HOWEVER THERE ARE STILL DEVISED THAT BECAUSE GENDER NON% CONFORMING USE TO BE HELD BACK AND FEEL EXCLUDED AND ISOLATED IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. SPECIFICALLY IN OUR SCHOOLS. ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUE SURROUNDING GENDER INCLUSIVITY IS THE APPROPRIATE RESTROOM FACILITIES. AFTER SERVING STUDENTS FROM AROUND THE STATE AT THIS CONFERENCE THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS EXPRESSED THAT THEIR SCHOOL DID NOT HAVE A GENDER NEUTRAL RESTROOMS. MOST SCHOOLS DON'T HAVE A GENDER NEUTRAL RESTROOM AT ALL. BUT THOSE WHO DO ARE ONLY ACCESSIBLE THROUGH WALKING KEY AND OFTEN DESIGNATED TO TEACHERS AND STAFF. STUDENTS MUST GO TO ACCEPT EXTENSIVE LINKS JUST TO SIMPLY USE THE RESTROOM. CREATING A BARRIER THAT FURTHER ISOLATES A GROUP THAT IS ALREADY SENSITIVE TO SOCIAL EXCLUSION. WHEN GOING TO SCHOOL OR ANYWHERE IN PUBLIC FOR THAT MATTER I TRY AT ALL COSTS TO AVOID USING THE RESTROOM? I DO THIS TO SKIP CONFLICT THINGS ID IN THE INVALIDATION THAT COMES ALONG WITH USING THE RESTROOM BUT DOES NOT LINE UP WITH MY GENDER IDENTITY. IMAGINE NOT BEING ABLE TO USE THE RESTROOM FROM EIGHT IN THE MORNING UNTIL FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON. I GO THROUGH THIS SCENARIO ALMOST EVERY SINGLE DAY. PERSONALLY I CAN'T FOCUS DRINK ENOUGH WATER. OR SIMPLY ENJOY MY DAY WILL NOT BEING ABLE TO USE THE RESTROOM. THIS IS THE REALITY FOR MEN MANY OF MY GENDER NON CONFORMING PEERS. ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE SIXTY SIX SIX IN PASSED IN. TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN STATES THAT STUDENTS CAN USE A FACILITY THAT LINES UP WITH THEIR GENDER IDENTITY REGARDLESS OF THEIR SEX TO SIGN UP. FOR HOWEVER THIS BILL DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR NON BINARY INDIVIDUALS. THE STUDENTS HAVE NO BATHROOM THAT LINES UP WITH THEIR GENDER IDENTITY. PERSONALLY I KNOW THAT HAVING A GENDER NEUTRAL BUT BATHROOM CAN CULTIVATE A SAFE ENVIRONMENT AND REDUCE THE STRESS THAT COMES ALONG BUYER WITH OUR CURRENT GENDER BINARY BATHROOM SITUATION. CONTINUING OFF WILL RAISE OR YOU PRESENTED WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE NEED FOR ALL SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA. TO INCLUDE A GENDER NEUTRAL RESTROOMS THAT IS UNLOCKED AND ACCESSIBLE TO ALL STUDENTS K. THROUGH. TWELVE IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS PROPOSAL. READILY ACCESSIBLE MEANS THAT THE STEPS NECESSARY TO UTILIZING THESE FACILITIES SHALL BE NO DIFFERENT THAN THAT OF OUR OTHER SCHOOL WIDE RESTROOMS. LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION. OF GENDER NEUTRAL RESTROOMS IN SCHOOLS. BUT IN THE CASE THAT SCHOOLS ALREADY HAVE GENDER NEUTRAL RESTROOMS THESE MUST BE MAKES US WILL TO STUDENTS. THE IMPLEMENTATION THIS PROPOSAL MAY REQUIRE FUNDING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. FOR FOR SCHOOLS DO NOT ALREADY HAVE A GENDER NEUTRAL RESTROOMS THEY'LL BE REQUIRED TO BUILD ONE AT THE EARLIEST CONVENIENCE OUR NEXT CONSTRUCTION PERIOD. THIS WILL ENCOURAGE SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL COST. IN THE CASE OF SCHOOLS HAVE ACCESS TO AN EXISTING ADDITIONAL RESTROOM. THEY MAY TRANSITION THIS RESTROOM TO A GENDER NEUTRAL SPACE. WITH THE FULL COST OF A CRATE REOCCURRING MAINTENANCE FOR THE FACILITY. WE UNDERSTAND COSTA HIGH WE BELIEVE THAT THE RESULTS FOR STUDENTS WILL BE WORTH IT. YOUR RESEARCH WE DISCOVERED THAT THERE IS NO BILL REQUIRING PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO HAVE A GENDER NEUTRAL RESTROOMS. WELL ALTHOUGH ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTY THIRTY TWO PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN REQUIRES ALL PUBLIC FACILITIES WITH A SINGLE STALL RESTROOM TO BE LABELED AS GENDER NEUTRAL SCHOOLS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE A SINGLE STALL RESTAURANT. THOSE WHO DON'T IDENTIFY WITH EITHER THE MALE OR FEMALE GENDER. HAVE LITTLE TO ACCESS TO GENDER NEUTRAL FACILITIES TODAY. THIS EXTRA BERRIER ISOLATES THEM. INCREASE UNHEALTHY STIGMA SURROUNDING THEM. THIS OFTEN STEMS FROM A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING ON THE TOPIC CREAMY BY A SENSE OF PREJUDICE AND DISCRIMINATION. EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT AS SOON IS INVOLVED IN TODAY IS CRUCIAL TO THE FUTURE. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THAT AS SUPPORTIVE AS PROGRESSIVE AS POSSIBLE. A PERFECT EXAMPLE. IN OUR CURRENT SOCIAL CLIMATE. PEOPLE ARE COMING MORE MORE ACCEPTING OF THOSE WHO DON'T CONFORM TO NUTRITIONAL STATUS QUOTES. A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THIS BEING ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN EIGHTEEN PASSED IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHICH REQUIRES AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION PROVIDE SUPPORT TO USE AND THEIR FAMILIES WHO HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF HARASSMENT AND BULLYING. ON THE BASIS OF GENDER IDENTITY. BOOK GENDER SEXUAL ORIENTATION. AND GENDER EXPRESSION. THE STATE HAS FORTY EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS AND THEIR GENDER IDENTITY AND WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THAT [inaudible] HOWEVER. WE SHOULD EXTEND AND CONTINUE THIS MOMENTUM. TO STUDENTS WHO DON'T CONFORM TO THE TRADITIONAL BINARY SCALE. WELL IT ISSUE SEEM DAUNTING MANY INSTITUTIONS HAVE ALREADY SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED AND SUPPORTED GENDER NEUTRAL FACILITIES. THE BISHOP SCHOOL IS ONE OF THREE SCHOOLS IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY TO HAVE GENDER NEUTRAL RESTROOMS. WITH THE STUDENT POPULATION OF EIGHT HUNDRED IN GRADES SIX THROUGH TWELVE BISHOP SCHOOL MAINTAINS FIVE GENDER NEUTRAL RESTROOMS. DINNER NEUTRAL RESTROOMS WOULD REMOVE THE PERCEIVED PROBLEM OF SPECIAL TREATMENT FOR THE FEW. OTHERWISE KNOWN AS NON BINARY STUDENTS WERE ALLOWED TO USE THE LOCKED RESTROOMS. IN ADDITION GENDER NEUTRAL RESTROOMS WOULDN'T INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF CONFIDENCE OF NON BINARY INDIVIDUALS AND DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF HARASSMENT BULLYING THAT THE STUDENTS EXPERIENCE. REFERRING BACK TO REYES PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IS COMMON THE NON BINARY INDIVIDUALS ARE OFTEN VERY ANXIOUS REGARDING RUSSIAN USE. ADDING THESE RESTAURANTS TO SCHOOLS WILL MAKE THE STUDENTS FEEL INCLUDED SUPPORTED AND RESPECTED BY THEIR MINISTRATION DISTRICT AND STATE. THE RESTROOMS WILL HELP NORMALIZE THE CONCEPT OF GENDER NON CONFORMITY AND WILL INCREASE THE GENDER DIVERSITY WITHIN SCHOOLS. ADDITIONALLY ON ISSUE THE DIALOGUE ON GENDER IDENTITY INCLUSION LOWER THE STIGMA BETWEEN BINARY AND NON BINARY PEOPLE. ESTABLISH SECURITY IN GENDER EXPRESSION AND LOWER THE ANXIETY OF PEOPLE GOING TO SCHOOL. AS A RESULT STUDENTS WILL FEEL VALUED AND HEARD WITHIN THEIR STUDENT BODY. WE ASK THAT YOU PROVIDE THE SAFE PLACE TO THE CALIFORNIA USED TO IDENTIFIES DOWNTURN ON CONFIRMING. AND FULFILL THE PROMISE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO PROVIDE AN INCLUSIVE AND CONDUCIVE LEARNING AND ENVIRONMENT TO ALL STUDENTS. WE CANNOT CLAIM THAT CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS ARE INCLUSIVE UNTIL INCLUDE EVERYBODY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU STAY THERE IN CASE ANYONE ASKING QUESTIONS. MISTER CHAIR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. A THE U. EFFORT FIRST A COMMENT -- VERY WELL PRESENTED -- VERY THOROUGH SO SO EXCELLENT JOB THERE IN YOUR PRESENTATION -- WITH REGARD YOUR PROPOSAL ARE YOU SEEKING TO HAVE GENDER NEUTRAL BATHROOM BATHROOMS AT ALL LEVELS MANY ELEMENTARY MIDDLE AND HIGH. ARE YOU JUST THINKING HIGH OR OR HAVE YOU NOT CONCLUDED ON A TEMP COME TO A CONCLUSION THE REST BY THAT WE WOULD APPRECIATE GENERAL'S RESTROOMS AT ALL K. THROUGH TWELVE GRADES. AT ALL WHAT I'M SORRY K. THROUGH TWELVE GRADES KINDERGARTEN THROUGH TWELFTH GRADE A SO ANY SCHOOL SITE YES ANY SCHOOLS. IN WITH REGARD TO ACCESS THIS THIS -- IF IF TO IDENTIFIES NON BINARIES THAT CORRECT YES OKAY THANK YOU. THE OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. WELL I WOULD JUST SAY RAY THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR STORY AND I THINK ALL OF YOU WHEN YOU COME YOU MAKE US BETTER LEGISLATORS BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE FORGET WHAT IT'S LIKE. TO HAVE BEEN IN K. THROUGH TWELVE AND SOMETIMES WE DON'T ALWAYS SHARE YOUR EXPERIENCE SO VERY WELL PRESENTED AND YOU'VE GIVEN US A LOT OF FOOD FOR THOUGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'D LIKE TO INVITE UP OUR NEXT GROUP. KEIRA KEENAN HON CAM AND ALL OVER FRENCH. WE TALK ABOUT CURRICULUM REFORM THIS SOUNDS VERY INTERESTING AS WELL. GOOD AFTERNOON AUDIBLE CHAIRWOMAN LEYVA CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL AND I SEE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY COMMITTEES AND EDUCATION. MY NAME IS JOHN CAN AND I'M A JUNIOR ATTENDING SOUTH PASADENA HIGH SCHOOL OF THE SOUTH PASADENA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. MY NAME IS CURE KEENAN AND I'M A SENIOR CURRENTLY ATTENDING MARYLAND HIGH SCHOOL AT SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY. MY NAME IS OLIVER FRENCH AND I'M A SOPHOMORE ATTENDING HIGH SCHOOL OF THE QATARI VOTER PARK UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WELCOME. THERE IS A COMMONLY ACCEPTED IDEA THAT LIFE AFTER HIGH SCHOOL CAN BE A DAUNTING TASK. AT THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN THE OBLIGATIONS OF ADULTHOOD BEGIN TO SAID IN. KNOWING HOW TO BUDGET YOUR PERSONAL FINANCES PREPARE FOR A JOB INTERVIEW AND MAINTAIN A GOOD CREDITSCORE ALL THINGS AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF ONE'S LIFE. AND EASE THE TRANSITION BETWEEN ADOLESCENCE AND ADULTHOOD. WE A STUDENTS RECOGNIZE A CALIFORNIA'S CURRICULUM FAILS TO PROVIDE EDUCATION ON SKILLS ESSENTIAL TO A SUCCESSFUL LIFE AFTER HIGH SCHOOL. IN SHORT NOT RICH AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL OVERLOOKS THE FACT THAT STUDENTS NEED INSTRUCTION ON CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. TAX FILING JOB PREPAREDNESS AND MANY MORE GENERALIZED SKILLS. THE LACK OF A STANDARDIZED CURRICULUM IN A REQUIRED GOVERNMENT AND ECONOMIC COURSES LIKE COVERAGE ON TOPICS LIKE COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL LITERACY. THIS IMAGINABLE BRIDGE DETRIMENTAL TO OUR SOCIETY. WITH THE CURRENT CURRICULUM STUDENTS ARE NOT TAUGHT HOW TO PREPARE FOR SUCCESSFUL JOB INTERVIEW MANAGE THEIR INCOME OR NAVIGATE THE AMERICAN TAX SYSTEM. THIS INFORMATION IS PARAMOUNT FOR FUNCTIONING IN THE WORLD OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL. HOW CAN THIS GENERATION PARTICIPATE IN THIS WORLD WHEN THEY'RE NOT PREPARED WITH THESE FUNDAMENTAL SKILLS? AND THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN NATIONAL REPORT CARD CREATED BY THE CENTER FOR FINANCIAL LITERACY OF CHAMPLIN COLLEGE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RECEIVED IN F. ONE GRADED ON CRITERIA CRITERIA BASED ON SAY EFFORTS TO IMPROVE FINANCIAL LITERACY. WE BELIEVE THAT THE REASON FOR THIS FAILING GRADE IS BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION CURRENTLY DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL CURRICULUM. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT OF THIS ISSUE LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOUTH PASADENA HIGH SCHOOL. MANY EXTRACURRICULAR CLASSES REQUIRE JOB SKILLS SUCH AS RESUME WRITING. BETTER SOON TO HAVE BEEN LEARNED BUT ARE NEVER FORMALLY TAUGHT IN ANY COURSE. THIS FAILURE TO TEACH BASIC LIFE SKILLS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE IN EDUCATION. AS A RESULT STUDENTS OFTEN FEEL ILL PREPARED TO PUT TO APPLY TO ON CAMPUS OPPORTUNITIES NONETHELESS OFF CAMPUS JOBS. HOWEVER SOME SCHOOLS HAVE TAKEN IT UPON THEMSELVES TO MEET STUDENT CONCERNS ABOUT THE UNCERTAINTY THEY FACE IN LIFE BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL. FOR EXAMPLE AT ENTERPRISE HIGH SCHOOL IN REDDING TEACHERS HAVE CHOSEN TO TEACH LE SCHOOLS BECAUSE THEY FEEL THAT IT IS A NECESSARY PART OF EDUCATION. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE A TEACHER WHEN IS THE NEED FOR STUDENTS TO LEARN HOW TO WRITE A RESUME AND PREPARE FOR AN INTERVIEW. RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE DANCE VOLUNTARILY TEACH THESE THINGS AND THE TIME FOLLOWING AN A. P. EXAM. THIS NEED IS NOT JUST RECOGNIZE BY ADULTS. BUT STUDENTS ARE CONSTANTLY LOOKING TOWARDS OUR FUTURE RESPONSIBILITIES ANALYZE AS WELL. ADDITIONAL IN A CREDO HIGH SCHOOL IN ROHNERT PARK AN ADULT IN CLASS WAS IMPLEMENTED A POPULAR REQUESTS FROM STUDENTS. STUDENTS WRENCHED EXTREMELY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE ELECTIVE CLASS. EVEN THOUGH HIS EFFORTS WERE VERY WELL RECEIVED BY STUDENTS THERE'S BEEN LITTLE EXPANSION OF THESE TEACHING METHODS AT THE STATE LEVEL. ULTIMATELY WE'RE DRIVING OUR GENERATION TO ACHIEVE HIGH TEST SCORES AND PROCEDURES COLLEGE ACCEPTANCES AND I FELL TO STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF OBTAINING THE NECESSARY KNOWLEDGE TO OVERCOME THE HARDSHIPS OF ADULTHOOD. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH CALIFORNIA STRIVING TO ACADEMICALLY PREPARE STUDENTS pFOR COLLEGE BUT WE CANNOT FOR AFFORD TO FORGET TO PREPARE THEM FOR TOSSES WILL. TO SPEAK ON MY EXPERIENCE I CURRENTLY ATTEND MARYLAND HIGH SCHOOL WHICH A COURT IN ANY SHOULD RANKS THIRTY THIRD IN COLLEGE PREPAREDNESS OF THE ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT EVEN ACADEMICALLY RIGOROUS SCHOOLS LIKE MIRA LOMA ARE INADEQUATE IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A LIFE SKILLS PREVIOUSLY ADDRESSED. I MENTION THIS ONLY TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT COLLEGE IS SIMPLY ONE OF THE MANY ASPECTS OF THE ADULT WORLD STUDENTS FACE OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. THUS A LIFE SKILLS CURRICULUM WOULD MEET THE STUDENTS NEEDS OF COLLEGE PREPARATION AS WELL AS THE SKILLS NECESSARY FOR SUCCESS BEYOND COLLEGE. WE RECOGNIZE THE JOINT EFFORTS MADE BY STUDENTS AND THEIR SCHOOLS TO IMPROVE ACADEMIC SKILLS AND RIGOR. STUDENTS LIKE MYSELF ARE PERFORMING AT AHIGH ACADEMIC LEVEL IN PREPARATION FOR COLLEGE. HOWEVER WE ARE LIMITED BY THE LACK OF AN ENFORCED AND STANDARDIZED CURRICULUM IN AREAS OF JOB PREPAREDNESS AND FINANCIAL LITERACY. SO CONSIDER ASKING OURSELVES. WHAT GOOD IS EDUCATION IF YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW TO APPLY IT? IN AN ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS STATISTICAL CONCERNS IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE NEXT GEN PERSONAL FINANCE RESEARCH REPORT. FINDS ONLY ONE IN. SIX HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS NATIONWIDE ARE REQUIRED TO TAKE A PERSONAL FINANCE COURSE TO GRADUATE. WHAT IS MORE IS THAT ONE IN TWENTY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS FROM LOW INCOME BACKGROUNDS ARE REQUIRED TO TAKE A PERSONAL FINANCE COURSE FROM STATES WITHOUT MANDATES? SO BECOMES CLEAR THAT THE STUDENTS WHO SUFFER THE MOST ARE THE ONES THAT ARE LEAST EDUCATED ON FINANCIAL LITERACY. ON THE SUBJECT OF CURRENT EDUCATION CODE EDUCATION CODE SECTION FIVE ONE TWO EIGHT FIVE POINT. FIVE SUBSECTION A STATES THAT WHEN THE HISTORY SOCIAL SCIENCE CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK IS REVISED AFTER JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY COMMISSION SHALL CONSIDER THE INCLUSION OF CURRICULUM RELEVANT TO HOW TO USE A SAVINGS AND CHECKING ACCOUNTS. HOW TO MAINTAIN A BUDGET? EMPLOYMENT [inaudible] LOANS INSURANCE FORMS OF TAXATION INVESTING IDENTITY THEFT PLANNING AND PAYING FOR POST SECONDARY EDUCATION AND CHARITABLE GIVING. EDUCATION CODE SECTION THREE THREE FIVE FOUR ZERO INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY COMMISSION SHALL ENSURE. THAT THE CURRICULUM INCLUDES INFORMATION REGARDING A VOTER EDUCATION. HOW TO REGISTER HOW TO REQUEST AN ABSENTEE BALLOT? HOW TO FIND A POLLING PLACE AND EVEN HOW TO PAY FOR COLLEGE? WE PROPOSE THAT THE LEGISLATURE AMEND THESE EDUCATION CODES WHICH CONCERN FINANCIAL LITERACY AND CIVIC EDUCATION. THE AMENDMENTS CONTAIN IMPORTANT TOPICS THEIR ABSENT FROM THE SECTIONS OF THE EDUCATION CODE. INCLUDING HOW TO FILE TAXES HOW TO COMPLETE JOB APPLICATIONS INTERVIEWS HOW TO WRITE RESUMES AND COVER LETTERS. AND HOW TO PRE REGISTER TO VOTE. AMENDMENTS SHOULD ALSO INCLUDE STANDARDS PERTAINING TO CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. PROFESSIONAL ETIQUETTE RETIREMENT PLANS AND MAINTAINING A GOOD CREDIT SCORE. WE URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO PASS THIS BILL AND EXPRESS OUR CONCERN TO THE AYE QC AND TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WHEN REVIEWS CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT CURRICULUM AND LOOKS ARE POSSIBLE AMENDMENTS IN THE FRAMEWORK. WITH THESE AMENDMENTS STUDENTS WILL BE PREPARED FOR LIFE AFTER HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WILL HAVE AN EASIER TIME PURSUING SPECIFIC YOUR PAST DUE TO A SURPLUS OF KNOWLEDGE AND PREPARATION. STUDENTS BECOME AWARE OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS AS ADULTS AND WILL SUCCEED IN FEELINGS OBLIGATIONS AS SUCCESSFUL. AND PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY. THIS PROPOSAL NOT ONLY ENSURES THAT VALUABLE SKILLS ARE AVAILABLE ALL SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA BUT THE ALL STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THE TEACHING OF THESE VALUABLE SKILLS. CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION CITY COURSES ARE AVAILABLE AND MANY HIGH SCHOOLS. BUT FAILED TO ENCOMPASS A COMPREHENSIVE CURRICULUM THAT INCLUDES ALL ASPECTS OF ADULT LIFE. AND EVEN THEN CITY EACH CLASSES ARE OFTEN ELECTIVES SO SOME STUDENTS OPT OUT OF AN OPPORTUNITY IF THEY DON'T KNOW THEY NEED. OR STUDENTS WHO WANT THIS SELECTIVE SIMPLY CAN'T TAKE IT DUE TO A SCHEDULING COMPLICATION. WHAT WE PROPOSES AMENDING THE AT CO TO INCLUDE THESE ESSENTIAL ASPECTS OF ADULTHOOD IN ECONOMICS AND AMERICAN GOVERNMENT CLASSES? TO THE EVERY STUDENT FEELS CONFIDENT WHEN THEY WALK INTO AN INTERVIEW. PREPARED WHEN FILING TAXES AND THEY KNOW THE LIFE OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL. STUDENTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA ARE HUNGRY FOR THIS KNOWLEDGE THERE ARE THOSE WHO DESPERATELY WANT TO LEARN MORE ON THESE TOPICS. AND THERE ARE THOSE WHO NEED THIS MATERIAL AND MIGHT NOT REALIZE THAT. WE FEEL A RESPONSIBILITY TO ALL THE STUDENTS TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS PREPARED AND EXCITED FOR THE WORLD BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL AS THEY SHOULD BE. WE HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THIS LEGISLATION WILL GUARANTEE THE FUTURE FINANCIAL AND FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY. STABILITY FOR THE NEXT GENERATION. THANK YOU ALL FOR LISTENING WE NOW OPEN THE FLOOR FOR COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS. EXCELLENT THANK YOU [inaudible] MISTER CHAIR. I YES THANK YOU I THANK YOU -- A FIRST ROLL I AGREE WITH YOU THAT -- PERSONAL FINANCE NEEDS TO BE TAUGHT AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL. I VERY MUCH SUPPORT THAT CONCEPT IN FACT DID IT FOR MANY YEARS. DID INSIDE THIS SENIOR ECONOMICS CLASS OF MY STUDENTS WOULD TAKE BECAUSE THE ECONOMICS CURRICULA IS ACTUALLY NOT THAT WHITE. HE CAN ACTUALLY COVER MOST OF IT WITHIN A PRETTY REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT YOU HAVE SOME TIME LEFT OVER THE SEMESTER. AND YOU CAN YOU KNOW DEFENDER TO TO PERSONAL FINANCE MORE EXTENSIVELY THAN YOU WOULD OTHERWISE AND WHEN I SEE PERSONAL FINANCE PEOPLE TALK ABOUT BALANCING A CHECKBOOK. NO ONE REALLY BALANCE A CHECKBOOK ANYMORE THEY GO ON THEIR COMPUTER RIGHT NOW A LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON BUT REALLY WHAT'S IMPORTANT ME AS PER AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PERSONAL FINANCES INVESTING FOR RETIREMENT. MAYBE FOR A HOME. AND THE FOUR ONE K. STOCK MARKET THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE PENSION WORLD IS IS CHANGED FOR SURE. SO PEOPLE NEED TO DO THAT ON THEIR OWN AND THEY NEEDED KNOW HOW TO DO THAT. ON THEIR OWN -- AND WHAT IS ALONE MAIN LONG TERM TO MY CREDIT WHAT IS I MEAN I DON'T PAN OUT WHAT IS A CREDIT CARD MEAN BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE GOING TO COLLEGE TO GET THEIR CREDIT CARD RIGHT. RYAN LOOKING MAYBE SOME WAS GUILTY OR I DON'T KNOW BUT I KNOW I WAS A TO PAY THAT OFF THAT INTEREST RATE IS VERY HIGH -- AND YOU CAN LEARN BY KNOWING YOU AN LEARN BY DOING SOMETIMES BETTER TO LEARN BY KNOWING. AND YOU CAN KNOW IF YOU LEARN IS CERTAINLY IN YOUR HIGH SCHOOL EXPERIENCE WHAT I WOULD SAY IS -- FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS I ACTUALLY SUPPORT THIS BUT I WOULD SAY TO LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHO WANT IF THEY CAN DO IT TODAY. THEY'RE ALREADY ADDING ON GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS AT THE LOCAL LEEL AND THEY SHOULD BE DOING. IT IN THIS CASE AS WELL OCT IF WE MANDATE IT FROM THE STATE LET'S SAY THE STATE SAYS YOU HAVE TO TAKE THIS CLASS YOU HAVE TO STUDY THIS CURRICULUM. WHAT THAT MEANS IS IT'S GONNA BE SCORED AS A MANDATE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT ACROSS THE STATE? TO TO PROVIDE THAT CLASS RENTS PAVE THE TEACHER TIME EXCEDRIN GETS VERY EXPENSIVE IT'S MORE OF A BURDEN ON THE GREATER STATE BUDGET DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE DON'T DO IT WE ARE YOU IT MANY CASES. BUT ON A MORE AND IT MORE IMMEDIATE. FOR LOOKING AT A WHAT FOR THE FOR THE FOR THE SHORT TERM I THINK THE BEST WAY FOR THIS TO BE HANDLED IS FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AT THEIR NEXT BOARD MEETING ADOPT A POLICY THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE TO GRADUATE -- A GRADUATION REQUIREMENT THAT WOULD SAY HEY YOU GOT IT YOU KNOW HAVE SOME SOME SOME EXPERIENCE AND PERSONAL FINANCE AND I THINK AGAIN. THE ECONOMICS. CLASS IS IS IS THE NATURAL PLACE NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF ITS NAME BECAUSE OF THE HOW THE CURRICULUM IS WRITTEN OUT SO ALL JUST I'LL JUST LEAVE YOU WITH THAT -- BUT AGAIN GREAT IDEA PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW PERSONAL FINANCE I WOULD ARGUE THESE WE TAUGHT IN COLLEGE. TOO QUITE FRANKLY AS PART OF A GENERAL ED REQUIREMENTS BUT THAT'S ANOTHER CONVERSATION BUT THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY VERY WELL THANK. YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ASSEMBLYMEMBER SMITH AND THEN YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND THE FACT THAT YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT THESE ISSUES ON BEHALF OF YOUR PEERS IS IS SIGNIFICANT. AND YOU KNOW NOT ON LIKE -- THE CHAIR MISTER O'DONNELL I DO AGREE THAT FROM THE STATE'S LEGISLATIVE PERSPECTIVE WE DO NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT BECOMES AT AT WHAT'S KNOWN AS AN UNFUNDED MANDATE -- BUT I DO THINK GOING FORWARD AS WE TALK ABOUT -- FULLY FUNDING K. TWELVE EDUCATION -- IN A WAY THAT IS MEANINGFUL AND ALLOWS US TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF ALL OF THESE KIND OF PROGRAMS. THAT THIS IS PROBABLY A COURSE WORTHY AS A STANDALONE AYE NEWMAN AYE OBVIOUSLY THERE'S ROOM FOR IT NOW IN THE ECONOMICS CURRICULUM BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FULL SPECTRUM. OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU POINTED OUT JOB RESUMES ENGAGING WITH YOUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT HOW TO TO FILE YOUR TAXES THERE ARE SO MANY ASPECTS NOW OF BEING READY TO ENGAGE IN ADULT LIFE PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE WHO GO ON TO IMMEDIATELY PURSUE OF OCCASIONAL CAREER. OR GO ON TO COLLEGE AND ARE ASSUMING THAT DEBTAND WHAT THAT MEANS IS CERTAINLY THINK THERE'S ENOUGH CONTENT HERE BUT WHERE WE ARE NOT. OUT YET IS A PLACE WHERE WE CAN PROBABLY ADD ON ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF CURRICULUM WITHOUT FUNDING TO BACK THAT UP SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU IN YOUR PEERS ON TO STAY. WITH US ON THIS ISSUE AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD PROBABLY THE BEST AVENUE RIGHT NOW IS TO PURSUE THIS WITH LOCAL DISTRICTS AND THOSE THAT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO EXPAND. BUT IT IS CERTAINLY WORTHWHILE AND SOMETHING THAT WE NEED. THANK YOU SOME A MEMBER RUSSELL OKAY. HI. BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S A NEW SLOGAN THAT'S BEEN POPULARIZED AND IT SAYS THIS IS WHAT DEMOCRACY LOOKS LIKE. IF ANYBODY'S BEEN OUT ON THE MARCH THAT'S WHAT'S USED -- SO I WANT TO THANK YOU. FOR ALL OF THESE PRESENTATIONS NOT JUST YOUR OWN -- BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT YOU ARE MAKING PROPOSALS. THAT GROW DEMOCRACY IN OUR WHOLE. STATE IN OUR WHOLE SOCIETY SO THAT'S THE FIRST THING I WANT TO SAY. AND I SPECIFICALLY -- OF BELIEVE THE PROPOSAL THAT YOU MADE TODAY IS REALLY IMPORTANT WE'VE LOST SO MANY. LIFE SKILLS. OUR TYPE OF CLASSES OVER THE YEAR TO BE SO FOCUSED ON GOOD THINGS LIKE MATH AND SCIENCE THAN OTHERS AND I'M NOT SAYING TO DO AWAY WITH THOSE AND I KNOW YOU WEREN'T EITHER. BUT THESE LIFE SKILLS OR JUST CRITICAL -- ARE IN A NON PROFIT THAT I STARTED A WE WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL TO DO A SUMMER PROGRAM WE DID THAT FOR SEVERAL YEARS. AND ONE YEAR WE SAID WELL WHY DON'T WE ASK THE STUDENTS WHAT THEY THINK. SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE SUMMER PROGRAM. AT THE TOP OF THE LIST. AND THIS IS A A POOR WORKING CLASS IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY -- THEY SAID THE STUDENTS SAID FINANCIAL LITERACY -- AND I WAS REALLY SURPRISED TRUTHFULLY BECAUSE I GREW UP OF THINKING -- WHY DO I NEED FINANCIAL LITERACY IF I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY -- WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY A DUMB WAY OF LOOKING AT IT BUT I'VE LEARNED OVER THE THAT I HAD THAT. EARLIER IN MY LIFE I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN INTIMIDATED BY IT AND I WOULD HAVE USED IT IN A USE MY SKILL IN A SMARTER WAY. SO -- I DON'T KNOW ALL THE PARTICULARS OF THE FUNDING AND I BELIEVE THAT. IN A WAY TO BE FOR THEIR EDUCATED BY MY COLLEAGUES BUT I DO THINK YOU ARE RAISING VERY VERY IMPORTANT THEY'RE NOT. YOU KNOW THE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD JUST BRUSH TO THE SIDE YOU'RE RAISING SOME CORE ISSUES -- FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND SO I APPRECIATED THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SENATOR. CENTER WILK BY SHARE. THANK YOU AND SHARE A GREAT PRESENTATION FACT ALL THE PRISON AND PRESENTATIONS AS FAR HAVE BEEN -- EXCELLENT -- I THE I THINK YOU'RE I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT ON THE MONEY OUT I WHICH I SCHOOL A LONG TIME AGO AND I DON'T RECALL IF IT WAS REQUIRED OR NOT BUT WE HAD WE HAD A WHOLE SEMESTER. WHERE WE LEARNED ALL THESE LIFE SKILLS? AND IT IS NOT TAUGHT ANYMORE NO FOR MY OWN CHILDREN I HAD TO TO TEACH THEM. ABOUT FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY BUT THEY WERE FORTUNATE TO GROW UP IN A DAY TWO FAST TWO PARENT HOME. WITH ENGAGE PARENTS AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE SO MY DISTRICT IS. MORE THAN LA COUNTY AND SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE FOSTER YOUTH IN ALL OF LA COUNTY. NOW RESIDES IN IN A VALLEY AND I THINK ABOUT THOSE STUDENTS AND AS MENTIONED EARLIER. THOSE WHOSE TO SUPPLY NEED IT THE MOST AND THEY'RE AND THEY'RE NOT GETTING THOSE RESOURCES SO THAT THE ASSEMBLY CHAIR SHARED -- CHALLENGES. THAT WE FACE -- WE TYPICALLY HAVE A A TO A TYPE DEAL LIKE THIS EVERY YEAR THAT DOESN'T GET ACROSS TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK. SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU. TO KEEP BUT KEEP FIGHTING ON THAT AND ONE DAY MAYBE WE CAN GET PEOPLE TO TO STEP UP AND DO THE RIGHT THING OR FIGURE OUT A A MORE CREATIVE WAY. TO TO MOVE MANEUVER AGAIN BUT I I JUST THINK THESE ARE ESENTIAL SKILLS THAT ALL YOUNG PEOPLE NEED AND EXCELLENT PRESENTATION. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR. I WOULD JUST SAY THAT I LOVE LIFE SKILLS I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL IF YOU CAN GET AGREE GRADE ON A PAPER BUT ONCE YOU GET A LITTLE FURTHER ALONG IN LIFE I KNOW NO ONE HAS NEVER EVER ASKED ME WHAT WAS YOUR GPA AND HIGH SCHOOL. WHAT WAS YOUR GPA IN COLLEGE BUT WHAT THEY DO WANT TO KNOW IS CAN YOU ADULT AS YOU WERE SAYING HOW DO WE DO ADULT AND -- I THINK AS YOU'VE HEARD SOME OF THIS IS ALREADY IN THE CURRICULUM HOW DO WE FIND A WAY TO MAKE SURE IT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING I THINK STARTING AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER SMITH SAID. STARTING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL LEVEL AND MEETING WITH YOUR SUPERINTENDENTS I KNOW THE SCHOOLS IN MY DISTRICT THE VERY ON WHETHER OR NOT THEY OFFER THESE LIFE SKILLS. I HAD IN SCHOOLS IN ECONOMICS AND BACK THEN WE DID LEARN HOW TO BALANCE A CHECKBOOK BUT I'M A LOT OLDER THAN ALL OF YOU PRY OLDER THAN YOUR PARENTS. SO WE HAVE TO KEEP UP ALSO WITH THE TIMES -- BUT WHAT I WOULD COMMIT TO USE IF I SPEAKING TO YOUR SUPERINTENDENTS I WOULD BE HAPPY TO DO THAT WE JUST RECENTLY DID A FINANCIAL LITERACY CLASS FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ARE -- EVENT IN OUR DISTRICT WE AT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY YOUNG MEN RANDY FOR THE WOMEN TO BUT WE DO YOUNG MEN'S CONFERENCE AS WELL AND THEY PAIRED UP AND THEY WERE EACH GIVEN A JOB AND TOLD HOW MUCH THEY MADE. AND THEN THEY HAD THE BUDGET FOR THEIR CHILDREN FOR EXPENSES -- AND WE WERE SURPRISED AS I AM SURPRISE IT TO AS HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ARE BRINGING THIS TO US SO YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT IT SO MEANS IT'S IMPORTANT TEO. SO WE APPRECIATE THAT AND WE THINK THE CURRICULUM ALREADY ALLOWS FOR THIS BUT WE NEED TO ALL COLLECTIVELY FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE ACTUALLY MAKE SURE IT'S HAPPENING. SO THANK YOU ANY FURTHER CLOSING COMMENTS. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU GENTLEMAN. ALL RIGHT NEXT WE ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM. IOWA SIMONE SOMEONE EVAN WAS ALWAYS ANNALISA ESCAMBIA. AND I'M SORRY IF I SAID YOUR NAME INCORRECTLY [inaudible] WELCOME. GREETINGS CHAIRWOMAN LEYVA CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL AND HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY COMMITTEES ON EDUCATION. MY NAME IS EVAN ROSE ALL US I'M A SENIOR AT SAMMY TO HIGH IN THE SAN BENITO HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT IN. SAN BENITO COUNTY. MY NAME IS AYE WHICH MEN I AM A JUNIOR AT CREATE A HIGH SCHOOL IN THE QATARI RUNNER PARK SCHOOL DISTRICT. IN SET NOT INSANELY NO COUNTY IN CINEMA COUNTY. VERY GOOD MY NAME IS LIZ ASKING ME I'M A SENIOR AT SAN MARINO HIGH SCHOOL IN SAN MARINO IN THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY. VICTIM RIGHTS LAWCENTER SENIOR LEGAL COUNSEL COLBY PRINTER STATED HOWEVER BAD YOU THINK THAT A COLLEGE CAMPUSES LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY IS ON SEXUAL ASSAULT. GO BACK FIFTEEN YEARS BEFORE AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING OUT FOR HIGH SCHOOLS. THE LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY INVOLVING SEXUAL ABUSE AND HARASSMENT CASES ON HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUSES HAS LED TO THE MISTREATMENT OF SUCH CASES. AND HAS CULTIVATED A SENSE OF MISTRUST AND RELATIONSHIPS AMONG STUDENTS AND FACULTY. THIS IS DETRIMENTAL TO FACILITATING EFFECTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT. WE PROPOSE CALIFORNIA MANDATE ALL SCHOOLS CLEARLY PUBLICIZE THEIR SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT PROTOCOLS IN FREQUENTED PLACES WITHIN SCHOOLS MAKING IT ACCESSIBLE TO THEIR STUDENT BODY. AS WELL AS POST THE NUMBER OF SUSPENSIONS AND EXPULSIONS RELATING TO SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT ON THE SCHOOL DASHBOARD UNDER THE EXISTING PUBLISHED EXPULSION AND SUSPENSION NUMBERS. IN MANY CASES IT IS THE FEAR OF JUDGMENT AND SOCIETAL STIGMA AS HOLDING STUDENTS BACK FROM COMING FORWARD AND SHARING THEIR TRAUMA. AT SAN BENITO HIGH SCHOOL A STUDENT WAS BULLIED FOR PORTING A SEXUAL ASSAULT. FRIENDS OF THE PERPETRATOR WOULD PUSH IT SCHOOL AND SAY IS THAT CONSIDERED RAPE. BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO BELIEVE THE PERSON IN QUESTION ACTUALLY DID THIS. THIS MADE OTHER SHIED AWAY FROM BRINGING UP THEIR OWN SITUATIONS TO SCHOOL AUTHORITIES AFTER SEEING THE TREATMENT SHE RECEIVED FOR REPORTING HER SALT. THE SITUATION IS NOT UNCOMMON ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL SEXUAL VIOLENCE RESOURCE CENTER ONLY CHILDREN SEXUAL ABUSE AGAINST CHILDREN IS EVER REPORTED TO AUTHORITIES. ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE APPROXIMATELY 70% OF RAPE AND ASSAULT VICTIMS EXPERIENCE MODERATE TO SEVERE DISTRESS. A LARGER PERCENTAGE THAN FOR ANY OTHER VIOLENT CRIME. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE THERE NEEDS TO BE A RADICAL CHANGE IN THE WAY STUDENTS ARE EDUCATED ON REPORTING INSTANCES OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND HARASSMENT. OUR GROUP ASKED OURSELVES WHAT STEPS WE SHOULD TAKE IF WE REFER TO FACE A SIMILAR SITUATION OF HAVING TO REPORT SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR ASSAULT. YOU MUST NEW WHO WE WOULD TURN TO OR WHAT STEPS WE WOULD NEED TO TAKE TO REPORT AN INCIDENT. WITH KNOWLEDGE THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH REMARK AIMS TO STANDARDIZE HEALTH EDUCATION WITH CURRICULA INVOLVING HEALTHY POSITIVE AND SAFE RELATIONSHIPS AND BEHAVIORS. WE HOPE THAT THIS PROPOSAL WILL EXPAND UPON AND REINFORCE REVISIONS MADE AND SERVICE BOTH A PROACTIVE AND REACTIVE SOLUTION TO THE MISTREATMENT OF THESE CASES WITH IN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS. IN ADDITION TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE LIZ HAS PRESENTED MY PEERS AND I FIND THAT IT IS IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT TO HAVE EASILY ACCESSIBLE STATISTICS. REGARDING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE EITHER SUSPENDED OR EXPELLED FOR ANY CRIMES RELATING TO SEXUAL SOUL OR HARASSMENT. WHILE KEEPING THE INFORMATION OF ALL ARTIES INVOLVED CONFLICT COMPLETELY CONFIDENTIAL. THE STATISTICS SHALL BE ADDED TO THE EXISTING DATA ON THIS pWHICH AIMS TO INFORM THE COMMUNITY ON WHETHER OR NOT SCHOOLS ARE MEETING STATE STANDARDS IN EDUCATION AND DISCIPLINE. AB THEIR MINIMUM WE REQUIRE SCHOOLS TO POST A RATE AT WHICH STUDENTS ARE SUSPENDED OR EXPELLED WITH NO REAL EXPANDED LIST ON THE REASONS THERE OF THEREFORE. THE CURRENT DATA THAT IS PROVIDED IT IS INSUFFICIENT. THIS LIST UNDER OUR PROPOSAL SHALL INCLUDE A SECTION ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE SUSPENDED OR EXPELLED FOR ALL SEX RELATED OFFENSES. THE PRIVACY OF ALL STUDENTS WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY PROTECTED AS IT WOULD ONLY INVOLVE NUMBERS NO NAMES OR OTHER INFORMATION THAT MIGHT THAT MAY REVEAL THE IDENTITY. OF ANYONE THAT IS A VICTIM OR ANYONE THAT HAS BEEN SUSPENDED OR EXPELLED. IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THIS INFORMATION IS PROVIDED TO THE PUBLIC AS IT ONCE OR TRANSPARENCY AND THUS ENCOURAGE SCHOOLS PURSUE ACTION IN DECREASING SEXUAL ASSAULT AND HARASSMENT INCIDENTS. IN FEAR OF HARMING THE SCHOOL'S REPUTATION AND THUS TURNING AWAY FUTURE STUDENTS FROM POSSIBLE ENROLLMENTS. IT IS ALSO ON THE RIGHTS OF THE STUDENTS AND BY EXTENSION THE PARENTS TO HAVE THIS INFORMATION IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A SAFER COMMUNITY. FOR COMMUNITY IGNORANT OF THE EXTENT OF THE DO NOTHING TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS IT. BY POSTING NUMBERS THE SCHOOLS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM IN A MEANINGFUL MATTER. WHICH ONE SOURCE IN SAFETY AND RESULTANTLY ALLOW PARENTS TO FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE SENDING THEIR CHILDREN TO OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. THIS MEASURE OF ACCOUNTABILITY WILL ALLOW SCHOOLS TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM EARLY ON AND POSSIBLY HOLD A TOXIC MINDSET THAT CAN ONLY GROWN TO FUTURE CRIMES WHEN THE STUDENTS ANSWER THE OUTSIDE WORLD. IT IS A THAT SPORTS PURPOSE TO HOLD SCHOOLS ACCOUNTABLE AND WITH THIS ADDED INFORMATION ITSELF FOR SCHOOLS TO BECOME ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE ISSUES CAUSED BY SEXUAL SOUL FOR IT IS A STUDENTS FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT. TO FEEL SAFE ON CAMPUS. THE INFORMATION WILL PUSH THE SCHOOLS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. HOLDING THEM LIABLE FOR THE BEHAVIOR OF THEIR STUDENTS AND THUS ALLOWING THE COMMUNITY TO FEEL MORE AT EASE WITH THOSE IN CHARGE OF MY PEERS FUTURE. THIS PROPOSAL EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSES THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY SURROUNDING SEXUAL HARASSMENT ACROSS THE STATE. WHICH WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE CORE ISSUES SURROUNDING SEXUAL ASSAULT AND HARASSMENT BY OUR DELEGATION. WE BELIEVE THAT POSTING CLEAR STEPS FOR VICTIMS FOR VICTIMS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT. WILL ENSURE THAT STUDENTS WHO ARE CONSIDERING COMING FORWARD ARE INFORMED OF THEIR RIGHTS AND KNOW THAT THEIR SUPPORTED BOTH MORALLY AND LEGALLY BY THEIR COMMUNITY. THE PRESENCE OF THESE POSTERS AND COMMONLY FREQUENTED AREAS OF THE SCHOOL WOULD NORMALIZE HEALTHY CONVERSATIONS AROUND SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT. CURRENTLY STUDENTS ARE WIDELY ON AWARE OF THEIR RIGHTS AND THE PROTOCOL SURROUNDING ACCUSATIONS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. AND WOULD ONLY FIND THEIR FULL EXTENT AFTER LENGTHY RESEARCH INTO THE SUBJECT. THE EASE OF ACCESS OF THIS INFORMATION COULD BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CRIME GOING UNREPORTED AND A PERPETRATOR BEING BROUGHT TO JUSTICE. THE CONTENT OF THESE POSTERS WILL PREPARE STUDENTS FOR FUTURE ENCOUNTERS SOMETHING THAT IS IMPLICIT IN THE DEFINITION OF EDUCATION. THE REVISION TO THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH FRAMEWORK WORKS AND SYMBIOTICALLY WITH OUR PROPOSAL. THE CONVERSATIONS IN THE CLASSROOM AND CITED BY THE UPDATED HEALTH REMARK WILL BE EXTENDED OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM AND INTO THE STUDENTS GREATER LIVES BY THE PUBLISHED PROTOCOLS TO BE POSTED IN THE COMMON AREAS OF SCHOOLS. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE POSTED PROTOCOLS IN EVERY SCHOOL AND THE ADDITION TO THE SECTION OF THE DASHBOARD PROMOTE TRANSPARENCY SURROUNDING SEXUAL MISCONDUCT IN SCHOOLS ACROSS THE STATE. AND TERMINATE THE TOXIC CLIMATE THAT IS PERPETUATED WITHOUT THEM. THIS PROPOSAL PROVIDES A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA TO PROTECT THE FUTURE GENERATIONS FROM THE PAINS OF THE PAST. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY WELL PRESENTED. MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU AGAIN VERY WELL PRESENTED VERY GOOD JOB -- JUST A COUPLE GOOD MAYBE A COMMENT AND A QUESTION WITH REGARD TO THE INFORMATION CAMPAIGN I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH YOU -- THAT SHOULD BE. DONE NOW. IT SHOULDN'T REQUIRE A LOT I THINK ANY PROACTIVE SCHOOL LEADER WOULD BE DOING THAT RIGHT NOW AND IT WOULD BE DONE ON AN ONGOING BASIS SO THAT ALL THE STUDENTS. WOULD KNOW THE POLICY BE ABLE SEE THE POLICY AND APPRECIATE AND RESPECT. THE POLICY SO I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT. WITH REGARD TO THE DATA WHERE YOU WANT TO PARSE IT APART TAKEN TAKEN APART AND INTO DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS -- WHAT WHAT WOULD THAT MEMBERS OR EVEN SCHOOL HAS LOW NUMBERS WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD PROVE WHAT WOULD WHAT WOULD ONE DO WITH THAT DATA DID YOU DO YOU KNOW AT THIS POINT -- I THINK THE WAY THAT OUR GROUP AND OUR DELEGATION WERE ENVISIONING IT IS IT WAS MORE JUST INFORMATION RATHER THAN LIKE PROVING A POINT ASKED WHETHER. THE SCHOOL HAD A HIGHER PERCENTAGE THAN OTHERS OTHER SCHOOLS BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT SCHOOLS ARE OFTEN IN VARIOUS DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES WITH VARIOUS DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS SO. IT'S NOT SO MUCH PROVING THAT% ONE SCHOOL HAS MORE THAN THE OTHER ONE SCHOOL IS BETTER THAN THE OTHER IT'S MOSTLY JUST TO KEEP THE STUDENTS AND THE PARENTS INFORMED ABOUT -- EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE STEPPING INTO WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND THEM REGARDLESS OF NOT WHETHER IT'S HAPPENING EXACTLY TO THEM. EXCELLENT SIR THANK YOU. OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. I DO I JUST HAD A QUESTION ON IT. AND I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT THE CHAIR SAID SO -- I KNOW COLLEGES HAVE TO REPORT TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO IT IS YOUR DATA KIND OF BE LIKE THE SAME CATEGORY SAYS IS IS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THAT ARE. PLEASE CRISIS LIKE THE LAST COUPLE DAYS RIGHT SO YEAH. IN OUR PROPOSAL WE WERE EXPECTING THAT WE WANTED TO PUT IT UNDER THE EXPULSION AND SUSPENSION NUMBERS JUST TO FURTHER CLARIFY SO RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT REALLY. NOTHING'S REALLY LISTED IT'S JUST SUSPENSION AND EXPULSION THERE'S NOT -- JUST SO THAT SAID SO DOES EVEN IF. BECAUSE A LOT OF EXPULSIONS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU KNOW BEING A SEXUAL PREDATOR SO. WE JUST WANT TO HAVE IT LISTED OUT SPECIFICALLY SO THERE WAS NO MISCOMMUNICATION OR ANY WAY. TO KIND OF LOOK AT IT AND NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING OKAY GREAT THANK YOU. YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR SO I WANNA MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR HELP SORRY NO NO GO RIGHT AHEAD. OKAY VERY GOOD -- SIR THANK YOU CATCHER SO MY QUESTION IS RIGHT NOW YOU SAY THAT YOU THERE'S NO WAY TO KNOW WITH THE SEXUAL ASSAULT OR HARASSMENT POLICIES ARE ON CAMPUS BECAUSE IT'S NOT POSTED IS THAT CORRECT. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING POSTED OKAY IF YOU WANTED TO KNOW WHAT THE POLICY WAS IS THERE ANY AVENUE TO FIND OUT WHAT THE POLICY IS. I DO I AM SURE IN THERE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE POSTED IN SLIGHT SCHOOLS MUSCLES HAVE BEEN POSTED SOMEWHERE IT'S JUST VERY DIFFICULT TO ACCESS AND A BIG PART OF OUR PROPOSALS TO MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE. BUT I AGREE WITH YOU A 100% -- AND SOMETIMES WE CAN STOP MAKING SURE PEOPLE ARE EDUCATED ON THAT BAD BEHAVIOR SO VERY INTERESTED IN YOUR PROPOSAL AND AFTER THIS AND WHEN YOU HAVE TIME. I'D LIKE YOU TO SPEAK WITH MY STAFF AND SEE IF THERE'S SOMETHING WE CAN MOVE FORWARD. ASSEMBLY MEMBER SMITH AND THEN SENATOR TORONTO. I THANK YOU SO I THINK WHAT YOU'VE ACHIEVED BY TYING THIS TO DASHBOARD REPORTING IS KIND OF THE SWEET SPOT OF LEGISLATIVE PROCESS SOMETIMES AND THAT IS HOW DO YOU ENSURE A MEASURE OF ACCOUNTABILITY. AND THERE IS NO GREATER INCENTIVE FOR DISTRICT TO TACKLE A PROBLEM THAN TO BE ACCOUNTABLE TO REPORT ON THAT PROBLEM AND I SO I THINK I'M I WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK IN CONJUNCTION WITH SENATOR LABOR'S OFFICE. ON ENSURING THAT WE ARE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS. VERY GOOD SENATOR ALSO YEAH I'M A LITTLE I'M IGNORANT OF THIS IS A SEXUAL ASSAULT PROTOCOL REQUIRED NOW. IN ALL SCHOOLS. SO YOU'RE TAKING THE NEXT STEP WHICH IS WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO EXIST. THAT TO MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE TO THE STUDENTS. AND HAVE YOU I THINK IT'S A FOLLOW UP TO SENATOR LAVERS QUESTION IS. HAVE YOU ENCOUNTERED A DIFFICULTY IN GETTING ACCESS TO IT -- IN. THE SCHOOLS WERE YOU'VE DISCUSSED THIS. PERSONALLY IF I WERE TO HAVE TO REPORT IN ASSAULT I WOULDN'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT I DON'T KNOW THE PROPER PROTOCOL I WOULD PROBABLY BE EMBARRASSED TO GO TALK TO SOMEONE -- AND I WOULD BE KIND OF SCARED IN A WAY REGARDLESS OF BEING ASSAULTED I WOULD BE SCARED. TO TELL A TRUSTED ADULT BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE PROPER PROTOCOL IS. AND DO YOU HAVE ACCESS TO OTHER PROTOCOLS LIKE HANDBOOKS OR OR THERE ARE OTHER WAYS IN WHICH OTHER. POLICIES OR PROCEDURES ARE COMMUNICATED TO STUDENTS. FROM IF I MAKE COMMENTS ON I REMEMBER -- IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS SCHOOL YEAR THAT WE HAVE A DAILY BULLETIN ARE HIGH SCHOOL WHERE -- IT READS THE NEWS AND I DO REMEMBER IN THE BEGINNING THEY MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT IT HOWEVER. IT HASN'T REALLY BEEN MENTIONED AGAIN AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE TO GO FOR ANYTHING IT WAS MENTIONED ONCE AND IT'S KIND OF NEVER MENTIONED AGAIN. SHE WAS ON OTHER SUBJECTS. POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ON OTHER SUBJECTS ARE THOSE COMMUNICATED OR DONE IN A BROADER WAY ARE GIVEN OUT TO OTHER PEOPLE NOT SPECIFICALLY THE SEXUAL ASSAULT. ARMED FOR BULLYING THERE'S A LOT OF BULLYING POSTERS I CAN GO INTO ANY CLASSROOM AND THERE'S THIS WE TA POSTER AND IT HAS LIKE A CELL PHONE AND THERE'S LIKE A CYBER BULLYING. AND HAS THE PHONE NUMBER AND YOU THE RIGHT DIRECTION SO I THINK WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR WHERE IT'S NOT PROTOCOL IN LEGISLATIVE LANGUAGE THAT HIGH SCHOOLERS CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT'S SOMETHING THAT SUCCESSFUL SOMETHING THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE THAT WOULD TAKE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TOWARDS MAKING EVERYTHING TRANSPARENT AND MAKING IT. AN ISSUE THAT ISN'T SO MUCH I'M EMBARRASSED I DON'T KNOW WHO TO TALK TO IT'S I'M. SCARED BUT I KNOW EXACTLY WHO I NEED TO TALK TO YOU HOW TO COMMUNICATE IT. THANK YOU VERY GOOD LET'S TALK FURTHER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU'RE WELCOME. ALRIGHT OUR NEXT IN THE LAST PANEL IS ON STATE FUNDING LIKE DIVIDE UP ARVIN HURRY. RITUAL LOU AND KENNETH CAM WELCOME. PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY CHAIRWOMAN LEYVA. CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL HIS TEAM MEMBERS AND STAFF FIRST AND FOREMOST THANK YOU. I THANK YOU FOR GIVING THE STUDENTS OF CALIFORNIA TO EXPAND THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS THEIR VOICES AND BE THE CHANGE THAT THEY SEEK IN THEIR EDUCATION SYSTEM. MY NAME IS ART AND HER HEARING AND I'M THE GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF STUDENT COUNCILS. WHEN I'M NOT DOING THIS I'M A SENIOR AT BERKELEY HIGH SCHOOL? MY NAME IS KIND OF KIM AND I AM THE EDUCATIONAL POLICY DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF STUDENT COUNCILS IN ADDITION TO BEING A SENIOR APRYL AND HIGH SCHOOL. MY NAME IS RACHEL LOU AND I SERVICES STATE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF STUDENT COUNCILS. I AM CURRENTLY A SENIOR AT SOUTH PASADENA HIGH SCHOOL IN SOUTHWEST UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. THIS ORGANIZATION TASK IS NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART. AND TO THE HEARTS OF MANY OTHER STUDENTS NOT JUST ACROSS THE STATE BUT ACROSS THE SPAN OF DECADES. A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY. CASK WAS FOUNDED SEVENTY TWO YEARS AGO BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH THE SKILLS NECESSARY TO BECOME FUTURE LEADERS AND PILLARS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE COMMUNITIES. SKILLS THEY COULD USE FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. OVER THE YEARS ORGANIZATION IS EXPANDED OUR ROLE BY ENHANCING THE ROLE OF STUDENT VOICE AND THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION DECISION MAKING PROCESS WITHOUT A LOCAL LEVEL IN OUR DISTRICTS. AND HERE AND SACRAMENTO. LAST LEGISLATIVE CYCLE CAST PASSED TWO BILLS AB TWO SIX ONE AND SP. FOUR SIX EIGHT AB TWO SIX ONE WAS AUTHORED BY THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND NOW STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND AND IT GAVE STUDENT BOARD MEMBERS. DISTRICT BOARD MEMBERS PREFERENTIAL VOTING RIGHTS AS BEFORE SIX EIGHT WAS AUTHORED BY THE HONORABLE CHAIRWOMAN SENATOR LEYVA AND ALLOWED FOR STUDENT BOARD MEMBERS TO HAVE ACCESS TO OPEN SESSION MATERIALS. THIS WASN'T A ONE OFF THING EITHER. ONE OF OUR FIRST ACHIEVEMENTS WAS PLACING A STUDENT BOARD MEMBER ON THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION AND WE HAVE PASSED A WIDE ARRAY OF STUDENT BILL SINCE. SO THIS LEGISLATIVE CYCLE I'VE ALREADY GOTTEN A FEW BILLS SENT TO LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL RANGING FROM CREATING A WHOLE NEW ENVIRONMENTAL AWARD SYSTEM FOR DISTRICTS TO GIVING STUDENT BOARD MEMBERS MOTIONING HOURS. ATTACHED TO EACH PROPOSAL THAT YOUR OFFICE IS NOW HAVE ISM BILL LANGUAGE THAT THE STUDENTS BEHIND ME AND I'VE CREATED FOR THEIR IDEAS AND I IMPLORE EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU TO SEND. THESE TO LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL AS WELL ALREADY THANKS TO SENATOR SKINNER'S OFFICE THE BATHROOM BILL HAS BEEN SENT AND IT'S FUN BACKED BUT ONLY FOR NOW. GAS VOICE HAS ALWAYS BEEN STRONG. ALWAYS. BUT IT'S ULTIMATELY THE LEGISLATURE THAT HAS THE POWER TO TAKE THAT VOICE AND TRANSLATED INTO CHANGE. BETWEEN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND TWO THOUSAND TWELVE COSCO'S RECEIVED ANNUAL STATE FUNDING AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. HOWEVER WHEN CATEGORICAL FUNDING WAS ELIMINATED FROM THE BUDGET OUR LINE ITEM WAS TAKEN AWAY WITH IT. EVER SINCE THEN OUR FUNDING HAS COME FROM FEES REQUIRED FROM SERVICES DONATIONS AND GRANTS. ARE MAJOR IN YOUR COFFEE CONFERENCES AND PROGRAMS UCH AS THE YOUTH ACTION SUMMIT OF CALIFORNIA AND THIS PROGRAM AS WELL CAN COST AN AVERAGE OF SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS PER STUDENT. THESE CONFERENCES ARE EXPENSIVE TO ATTEND BUT ONE CASK WAS STILL RECEIVING FUNDING BY THE STATE. THEY COST LESS THAN A LOT FOR MORE DIVERSE DELEGATION TO THE AVAILABILITY OF SCHOLARSHIPS TO GET STUDENTS TO ATTEND PROGRAMS. CAST REMAINS ONE OF THE GREATEST CHOICES OF MY LIFE AND I WILL NEVER REGRET IT. BUT IT WOULD IS REGRETTABLE HOWEVER IS A FACT THAT STUDENTS THAT STAND TO BENEFIT THE MOST FROM OUR LEADERSHIP TRAINING-CANNOT AFFORD THEM IN OUR POOLER REPRESENTATION DESPITE ALL EFFORTS TO THE CONTRARY. CONTINUE TO DIMINISH. THE STUDENTS AND THERE IS A CALIFORNIA LEAST REPRESENTED WITHIN CAST CONTINUE TO NOT ONLY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN LEADING INTO AN UNENDING CYCLE THE ONLY YOUR SUPPORT CAN HELP BREAK. WE HAVE MADE CONSISTENT EFFORTS TO INCLUDE ALL VOICES. BUT IS BECOME NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DO SO A CERTAIN GROUPS OF STUDENTS SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD TO ATTEND. CAST CANNOT AFFORD TO SEND LOW INCOME STUDENTS PROGRAMS EVEN IF THEY APPLY FOR AND QUALIFY FOR SCHOLARSHIPS BECAUSE WITHOUT THE CURRENT LACKEY A STUDY STATE FUNDING. THERE'S FAR TOO LITTLE MONEY FOR SCHOLARSHIPS. AS A RESULT. WE'RE ASKING THE LEGISLATURE TO PROPOSE AN AUGMENTATION TO THE STATE BUDGET FOR ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF STUDENT COUNCILS. AND THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED EITHER -- YOUTH ORGANIZATIONS LIKE -- THE YMCA'S YOUTH IN GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY RECEIVED A ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR LINE ITEM IN THE TWENTY THIRTEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN STATE BUDGET. NEARLY ALL OF THESE FUNDS. WILL BE GOING TO US ARE WOULD BE GOING TO US WILL BE USED IN ORDER TO CONTINUE PROVIDING THE STUDENT PLATFORMS THAT MOTIVATED US IN THE FIRST PLACE TO COME HERE. TO CONDUCT LEADERSHIP TRAINING IN THAT WE SEEK TO BE WE NEED THE SUPPORT FROM THE STATE TO CONTINUE TO SURVIVE. TOBE SPECIFIC EVEN MORE SPECIFIC TWO THIRDS OF THIS MONEY WILL GO TOWARD STUDENTS SCHOLARSHIPS FOR OUR CONFERENCES. THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THIS WOULD EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATE THE BARRIEROF ENTRY ENSURING THAT NO STUDENT WHO IS INTERESTED IS TURNED AWAY FROM ANY OF OUR EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIENCES AS A RESULT OF FIRE FAMILY FINANCES. BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT IS SIMPLY NOT FAIR. IT'S COMPLETELY AND I UNDERSTAND IT'S COMPLETELY POSSIBLE TO BELIEVE THAT WE DON'T NEED THE STATE FUNDING BECAUSE WE'RE HERE AREN'T WE BUT BUT WE'RE NOT. WE'RE NOT ALL HERE IN OTHER WORDS THERE ARE CURRENTLY THE WE ARE CURRENTLY PRESENTING TO THIS INCREDIBLE DELEGATION OF THIRTY TWO STUDENTS THE STUDENTS ARE ULTIMATELY NOT REPRESENTATIVE. OF ALL OF CALIFORNIA MOST OF IT. PROBABLY YES. BUT WE CAN DO MORE IN TO US THIS IS A PRESSING ISSUE. FOR STUDENT VOICE TO TRULY BE REFLECTIVE OF THE ENTIRE STATE WE NEED TO EXTEND AN OPEN INVITATION TO EVERY SINGLE STUDENT OUT THERE AND THIS IS WHAT NEED BASED SCHOLARSHIPS DO. THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY IS REALLY AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS IT GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO EMPOWER STUDENTS FROM ACROSS THE STATE. THROUGHOUT BECAUSE HE BASED RESEARCH AND ACTION ADDITIONALLY IT ALLOWS US TO CONTINUE TO REPRESENT THE DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S SIX POINT THREE MILLION STUDENTS. NOT JUST THE SELECT FEW. WE PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS SEES AS YOU ALL HAVE MENTIONED. AS WE CONTINUOUSLY PROVIDE LEGISLATORS AND OTHER EDUCATION POLICY MAKERS WITH INSIGHTS ON STUDENT OPINION. THAT CAN ONLY BE FOUND THROUGH REAL IN HER TESTIMONIALS. THROUGH OUR CONFERENCES HERE IN SACRAMENTO OUR WORK WITH TOP POLICY MAKERS AND THEIR STAFF AND OTHER GROUPS INFLUENCING EDUCATION POLICY WE ARE CALIFORNIA STUDENT VOICE. NOT ONLY IS OUR INPUT BEING VOCALIZED. BUT STUDENTS SUCH AS THE ONES BEFORE YOU TODAY ARE EXPERIENCING CIVIC ENGAGEMENT IN ITS MOST FORM. TRANSLATING THEIR IDEALS AND ISSUES INTO REAL CHANGE THROUGH THE PROPOSAL'S YOU'VE SEEN TODAY. INSTEAD OF HIRED CONSULTANTS PROVIDING YOU WITH INFORMATION WE PROVIDE REAL FIRST HAND ACCOUNTS OF HOW POLICY IS BEING IMPLEMENTED FROM STUDENTS WHO EXPERIENCE IT IN THEIR EVERYDAY LIVES. WITHOUT YOUR SUPPORT THIS VALUABLE INSIGHT MAY BE LOST. I HOPE THAT YOU FOUND THESE PROPOSALS TODAY AND GAUGING AND INSIGHTFUL. MOVING FORWARD THEIR STEPS TO BE TAKEN IN ALL OF OUR TOPICS BUT WITHOUT FUNDING CONFERENCES LIKE THIS. THESE OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS AND THE LEGISLATURE MAY CEASE TO EXIST. TWO YEARS AGO MY FIRST TIME SPEAKING TO THE LEGISLATURE IN CAMPUS CURRENT SEAT -- WAS A REVELATION IT WAS INCREDIBLE AND IT IS INCREDIBLE TO BE RECOGNIZED AND RESPECTED NOT IN SPITE OF OUR YOUNG AGE BUT BECAUSE OF OUR UNPARALLELED STUDENT PERSPECTIVE. I WAS THE TEXTBOOK DEFINITION OR BROTHER I STILL AM THE TEXTBOOK DEFINITION OF AN INVOLVED STUDENT -- TRYING OUT EVERY YOUTH ORGANIZATION AVAILABLE TO ME AND I CAN DEFINITELY TELL YOU AFTER TRYING. SO MANY THAT NOTHING COMES CLOSE. THERE'S NO OTHER ORGANIZATION THAT IS SO INSISTENT AND CONSISTENT AS YOU HAVE SEEN FROM OUR MULTIPLE PRESENTATIONS ON SEEKING STERN VOICE AND CULTIVATING SOON POTENTIAL. IN THE STUDENTS THAT YOU SEE TODAY SUPPORT WOULD ALLOW FOR THREE HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN MORE OF THE STUDENTS THREE HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN MORE STUDENTS TO MAKE UP DELEGATION LIKE DELEGATIONS LIKE BEES. AND NOT ONLY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH MORE INSIGHT MORE REPRESENTATIVE INSIGHT BUT TO BRING THAT INSIGHT AND TO BRING THAT EXPERIENCE BOX THEIR LOCAL. AS A SCHOOL DISTRICTS THIS IS WHAT WE CALL THE CASF RIPPLE EFFECT AND WE'D REALLY LIKE TO SEE IT HAPPEN EVEN MORE SO THROUGH THE STATE FUNDING. AS THE LARGEST STAKEHOLDERS IN THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION SYSTEM. STUDENTS NEED TO HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD BOTH LOCALLY AT SCHOOL SITES AND AT THE STATE LEVEL. AND CAST PROVIDES STUDENTS WITH THAT OPPORTUNITY. CAST BECAUSE INTRODUCED ME TO THE PEOPLE AND PATHWAYS I COULD NOT HAVE IMAGINED TWO YEARS AGO. AND I CANNOT IMAGINE A FUTURE WITHOUT THIS ORGANIZATION. ULTIMATELY THE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IT IS ACTIVE SUPPORT TOWARDS THIS DELEGATION. AND FUTURE ONES AND SIX POINT THREE MILLION STUDENTS WE ALL REPRESENT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND I NOW OPEN THE FLOOR FOR COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COMMENTER QUESTIONS. ANYONE ELSE YES CENTER CHIANG. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN -- I JUST REALLY WANT TO COMMEND ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE AND I'M VERY PROUD TO SEE. STUDENTS FROM MY DISTRICT -- REPRESENTED HERE FROM BERLIN TO AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT YOU GUYS ARE. JUST. SHINING EXAMPLES OF HOW BRIGHTER FUTURE IS AND I'VE BEEN SO IMPRESSED WITH THE PRO WITH THE PRESENTATIONS AND I'D LOVE TO SEE. HOW WE CAN HELP FUND THIS PROGRAM AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE? HAVE A MORE DIVERSE -- POPULATION OF STUDENTS COMING UP TO TO PARTICIPATE SO THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY TO THAT I THINK WE SHOULD WILL FIND A WAY TO FIND THAT HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND WE NEED TO PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS YOU ARE OUR YOUTH YOU ARE OUR FUTURE. IT IS ON YOU -- TO FIX WHAT WE HAVE ADULT AS ADULTS HAVE SCREWED UP IN THE WORLD SO THE LEAST WE CAN DO IS FIND YOU A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY. SO I THINK THERE MAY BE A COMMITMENT UP HERE FOR ONE OF US TO FIGURE THAT OUT -- SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GO. TO YOU CAN. SIR RUSSELL I'M SORRY. YES -- EARLIER WE JUST HAVE A QUESTION I DIDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND I WAS ASKING ABOUT. YOU HAVE THIS -- CHART HERE OF PASSED. AND IT SHOWS. ZERO CAN THE BOTTOM I DON'T UNDERSTAND. NO MORE FUNDING THERE HAD BEEN FUNDING AND GET AND IT WAS. RIGHT IT WAS STOPPED IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN YES YES SO WHAT WAS THE RATIONALE FOR THAT. MANAGER BUDGET REDUCTIONS I BELIEVE IT PLEASE MISTER CHAIR I JUST DIED AT THE I THINK WHAT'S HAPPENED OVER TIME. IS THIS EFFORT HAS BEEN FUNDED ON AN INTERMITTENT BASIS -- SOME YEARS OR FLUSH AND WE WE'VE ALLOCATED DOLLARS AND I THINK SPECIFICALLY DURING THE LAST RECESSION. THEY ALL MONEY WAS REMOVED FOR THIS EFFORT AND THEN RECENTLY WE'VE STARTED TO CLIMB BACK. THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING FOR THOSE. THERE WAS NO SPECIFIC REASON FOR THIS ORGANIZATION OTHER THAN JUST GENERALLY THE FUNDING OKAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I THINK KENNETH WE'RE GONNA TURN IT TO YOU FOR CLOSING YOU MAY STAY THERE YOU MAY GO TO THE PODIUM WHICHEVER YOU PREFER.
