00:11:03.229 --> 00:11:05.131
VALUABLE TO THEM AND FURTHER

00:11:05.197 --> 00:11:06.065

00:17:55.274 --> 00:17:56.475
TEACHING I DEVELOP MY LESSON

00:17:56.542 --> 00:17:58.043
PLANS TO MEET MY NEEDS TO THE

00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.011
STATE HOW WE COMMUNICATE WITH

00:17:59.077 --> 00:18:00.312
EACH OTHER. BUT I NEED

00:18:00.379 --> 00:18:02.514
RESOURCES. AND THAT'S WHY I'M

00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:03.081
GONNA JUMP TO THE FORMATIVE

00:18:03.148 --> 00:18:04.583
QUESTION. YEAH I HEARD YOU TALK

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:06.251
ABOUT INTERIM BUT- IF WE LOOK

00:18:06.318 --> 00:18:07.753
AT THE ORIGINAL CODE SECTION AS

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.154
ORIGINALLY CONTEMPLATED THE

00:18:09.221 --> 00:18:11.857
ASPECTS SYSTEM. IN CALIFORNIA

00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:12.791
STATE CODE SPEAKS TO FORMATIVE.

00:18:12.858 --> 00:18:14.426
YEAH I DON'T SEE MUCH ON THE

00:18:14.493 --> 00:18:15.561
FORMATIVE FRONT I SEE SOME

00:18:15.627 --> 00:18:16.562
INTERIM THERE'S BEEN SOME

00:18:16.628 --> 00:18:18.230
ALTERATIONS OF THAT TO MAKE IT.

00:18:18.297 --> 00:18:20.466
SO THE CLASSROOM TEACHERS LOW

00:18:20.532 --> 00:18:21.433
OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS A

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:21.934
CLASSROOM TEACHER COULD

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.735
IDENTIFY. HOW OTHER STUDENTS

00:18:23.802 --> 00:18:25.671
ARE DOING ON ON THOSE STANDARDS

00:18:25.737 --> 00:18:27.372
WOULD. WHEN CAN WE GET MORE

00:18:27.439 --> 00:18:30.742
FORMATIVE. ARE YOU GOING TO TRY

00:18:30.809 --> 00:18:34.880
ARE YOU. SO AS AS THE

00:18:34.947 --> 00:18:36.081
CONSORTIUM DEFINES THE

00:18:36.148 --> 00:18:38.650
FORMATIVE- PROCESS THE TOOLS

00:18:38.717 --> 00:18:40.519
FOR TEACHERS AYE- I AM

00:18:40.586 --> 00:18:42.721
CONFIDENT WILL BETTER ADDRESS-

00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:45.157
BOTH MY AND HOPEFULLY YOUR

00:18:45.224 --> 00:18:46.959
DEFINITION OF FORMATIVE

00:18:47.025 --> 00:18:51.163
PROCESS- I AGREE- WE DID NOT

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:52.331
HIT THE MARK ON THE DIGITAL

00:18:52.397 --> 00:18:54.766
LIBRARY IT WAS THE RESOURCES

00:18:54.833 --> 00:18:57.569
WERE NOT- WE'RE NOT ENGAGING-

00:18:57.636 --> 00:18:59.638
THEY WERE NOT HELLO THEY WERE

00:18:59.705 --> 00:19:02.341
NOT- CONSISTENTLY ORGANIZED-

00:19:02.407 --> 00:19:03.775
THEY OVER HALF EMPHASIZE

00:19:03.842 --> 00:19:05.277
PROCESS AND THEY DIDN'T-

00:19:05.344 --> 00:19:08.113
SUFFICIENTLY ADDRESS RESOURCE-

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:08.981
AND I THINK THERE IS A

00:19:09.047 --> 00:19:11.183
PARTICULAR. GROUP OF PEOPLE

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:13.585
THAT WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:19:13.652 --> 00:19:15.254
EVERY TIME YOU LOOKED AT A

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.222
RESOURCE YOU YOU SAW THE ENTIRE

00:19:17.289 --> 00:19:20.592
FORMATIVE PROCESS LAID OUT- SO

00:19:20.659 --> 00:19:24.029
WHAT WE REALLY FOCUSED ON WAS-

00:19:24.096 --> 00:19:26.465
BEING AND ISN'T THAT- THERE ARE

00:19:26.532 --> 00:19:28.066
GOING TO BE MASTER TEACHERS

00:19:28.133 --> 00:19:29.635
THEY'RE GONNA BE USING THAT AND

00:19:29.701 --> 00:19:30.702
THEY'RE GOING TO BE OFFICE

00:19:30.769 --> 00:19:32.170
TEACHERS. AND SO BEING ABLE TO

00:19:32.237 --> 00:19:34.473
TURN THE DIAL OFF AND LETTING

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:36.141
PEOPLE SEE GO INTO THE

00:19:36.208 --> 00:19:37.809
RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED BEING

00:19:37.876 --> 00:19:39.044
ABLE TO SEE MULTIPLE STEPS THEY

00:19:39.111 --> 00:19:42.347
WANT SEE STEPS BEING. JUST THE

00:19:42.414 --> 00:19:44.116
RESOURCES THEY AND WHY IF THEY

00:19:44.182 --> 00:19:45.150
IF THEY KNOW THE MUSCLES I'M

00:19:45.217 --> 00:19:46.852
KIND OF CONFUSED WITH THE WIND

00:19:46.919 --> 00:19:49.354
I'M STARTING TO PAY OFF

00:19:49.421 --> 00:19:49.988
MULTIPLES WHEN I'M TO SEE IS I

00:19:50.055 --> 00:19:54.326

00:19:54.393 --> 00:19:54.993
SEE I WANT TO SEE WHAT THE TEST

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:55.661
IS THE I DON'T TEACH THE- EVERY.

00:19:55.727 --> 00:19:57.429
BUT I CERTAINLY WANT TO ACCESS

00:19:57.496 --> 00:19:58.897
TO IT SO I CAN EVEN AT THE END

00:19:58.964 --> 00:19:59.631
OF THE DAY I CAN PUT UP ONE

00:19:59.698 --> 00:20:01.366
QUESTION. AND WE CAN VERBALLY

00:20:01.433 --> 00:20:02.434
GOAL OR IT'LL TAKE THREE

00:20:02.501 --> 00:20:03.969
MINUTES NO IT'S A IT'S A QUICK

00:20:04.036 --> 00:20:10.075
THING. SO THAT'S SO SOME F THE

00:20:10.142 --> 00:20:12.210
MEN ARE DOWN- THE OF THE FOR-

00:20:12.277 --> 00:20:14.780
IS SO WE WILL BE MAKING

00:20:14.846 --> 00:20:16.682
AVAILABLE FREE IN TERM

00:20:16.748 --> 00:20:19.351
ASSESSMENT ITEMS IN A POOL-

00:20:19.418 --> 00:20:21.987
WHICH WILL ALLOW- TEACHERS TO

00:20:22.054 --> 00:20:24.056
SELECT A PARTICULAR ITEM AND

00:20:24.122 --> 00:20:26.291

LITTLE BIT MORE EASIER AS PART

00:20:32.064 --> 00:20:34.800
OF THE FORMATIVE- SO AS A SORT

00:20:34.866 --> 00:20:39.838
pLIBRARY IS OF MORE ABOUT-

00:20:39.905 --> 00:20:41.173
STRUCTURING AN ACTIVITY IN A

00:26:13.138 --> 00:26:14.406
MARCOS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT

00:26:14.472 --> 00:26:16.308
IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. OUR SCHOOL

00:26:16.374 --> 00:26:17.943
HAS ROUGHLY SEVEN HUNDRED

00:26:18.009 --> 00:26:19.844
STUDENTS 80% OF OUR STUDENTS

00:26:19.911 --> 00:26:22.480
ARE AT THE POVERTY LINE 78% ARE

00:26:22.547 --> 00:26:25.050
HISPANIC. AND ABOUT 50% OF OUR

00:26:25.116 --> 00:26:26.418
STUDENTS ARE ENGLISH LANGUAGE

00:26:26.484 --> 00:26:27.819
LEARNERS ALTHOUGH WE SUSPECT

00:26:27.886 --> 00:26:30.455
THAT PERCENTAGE IS MUCH HIGHER

00:26:30.522 --> 00:26:32.357
BECAUSE IT DEPENDS ON HOW. WE

00:26:32.424 --> 00:26:33.525
STILL OUT THE LANGUAGE SERVING

00:26:33.591 --> 00:26:34.960
MOST OF OUR FAMILIES DO NOT

00:26:35.026 --> 00:26:36.194
SPEAK ENGLISH SO I AM

00:26:36.261 --> 00:26:37.662
PRACTICING MY SPANISH SO THAT I

00:26:37.729 --> 00:26:38.496
CAN COMMUNICATE MORE

00:26:38.563 --> 00:26:39.831
EFFECTIVELY WITH THEM AND I GET

00:26:39.898 --> 00:26:41.766
BETTER EVERY SINGLE DAY. I WE

00:26:41.833 --> 00:26:43.535
WERE CARD AT TO GET OUR

00:26:43.601 --> 00:26:44.602
FAMILIES ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN

00:26:44.669 --> 00:26:46.504
THEIR CHILDREN'S LEARNING. IT

00:26:46.571 --> 00:26:49.741
IS OUR GREATEST CHALLENGE AND-

00:26:49.808 --> 00:26:50.875
AS A MATTER OF FACT WE HAVE THE

00:26:50.942 --> 00:26:53.144
HIGHEST- CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM OF

00:26:53.211 --> 00:26:54.946
THE ENTIRE DISTRICT SO THAT'S

00:26:55.013 --> 00:26:58.717
ONE OF OUR CHALLENGES AT OUR

00:26:58.783 --> 00:26:59.317
SITE WE WORK VERY HARD AT THIS

00:26:59.384 --> 00:27:00.452
WEEK CAN WITH HER FAMILIES WE

00:27:00.518 --> 00:27:01.786
ARE WORKSHOPS WE HAVE COFFEE

00:27:01.853 --> 00:27:04.122
CHATS WITH FAMILY DAYS

00:27:04.189 --> 00:27:04.689
EVERYTHING WE CAN DO TO GET

00:27:04.756 --> 00:27:07.525

00:27:07.592 --> 00:27:09.327
THAT KIND OF CAPS AND HE IS A

00:27:09.394 --> 00:27:10.261
VERY LITTLE SO WE'RE WORKING

00:27:10.328 --> 00:27:12.364
WITH OUR SUPERINTENDENT TO WORK

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:13.665
ON PROVIDING TRANSPORTATION TO

00:27:13.732 --> 00:27:14.599
OUR STUDENTS BECAUSE WE'RE THE

00:27:14.666 --> 00:27:16.201
ONLY DISTRICT OR THE ONLY

00:27:16.267 --> 00:27:17.135
SCHOOL IN OUR DISTRICT THAT HAS

00:27:17.202 --> 00:27:19.137
A UNIQUE BOUNDARY LINE AND SO

00:27:19.204 --> 00:27:20.705
IT'S AN EQUITY ISSUE FOR

00:27:20.772 --> 00:27:22.040
FAMILIES THEY HAVE TROUBLE

00:27:22.107 --> 00:27:24.609
GETTING THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL SO

00:27:24.676 --> 00:27:25.176
WE'RE WORKING ON THAT THAT'S

00:27:25.243 --> 00:27:25.910
OUR CHALLENGE. BUT ON THE OTHER

00:27:25.977 --> 00:27:27.612
HAND ONE OF OUR GREATEST SIX.

00:27:27.679 --> 00:27:28.713
IS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO CREATE A

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:31.049
MATHEMATICS LABORATORY SCHOOL.

00:27:31.116 --> 00:27:34.753
WHY WE HAVE A MATH COACH. AND

00:27:34.819 --> 00:27:35.553
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO OUR

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:37.222
LABORATORY TO CREATE HIGH

00:27:37.288 --> 00:27:38.556
QUALITY TEACHING AND LEARNING

00:27:38.623 --> 00:27:39.624
THAT'S RESULTING IN STUDENTS

00:27:39.691 --> 00:27:41.459
WHO ARE. HIGHLY COMPETENT

00:27:41.526 --> 00:27:42.961
CONFIDENT AND HAVE A POSITIVE

00:27:43.028 --> 00:27:44.863
DISPOSITION TOWARDS MATHEMATICS

00:27:44.929 --> 00:27:46.331
AND ACTUALLY. THEY ARE

00:27:46.398 --> 00:27:48.800
OUTPERFORMING. OUR DISTRICT

00:27:48.867 --> 00:27:49.401
AVERAGE SO WE'RE VERY PROUD OF

00:27:49.467 --> 00:27:50.969
THAT. SO THAT'S A LITTLE BIT

00:27:51.036 --> 00:27:54.005
ABOUT WHO WE ARE AND I WANTED

00:27:54.072 --> 00:27:54.906

00:27:54.973 --> 00:27:56.708
WE ARE HERE WE WANTED TO SHARE

00:27:56.775 --> 00:27:58.043

00:28:00.078 --> 00:28:01.613
IDEAS- FOR CHANGING FOR

00:28:01.679 --> 00:28:05.683
IMPROVEMENT. SO WELL- EXPECTS

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:07.685
ONLINE ASSESSMENT HAS OBVIOUSLY

00:28:07.752 --> 00:28:09.721
MADE- TESTING MUCH MORE

00:28:09.788 --> 00:28:11.489
EFFICIENT THAN PREVIOUS TEST.

00:28:11.556 --> 00:28:12.757
AND IT IS A LINE TO THE STATE

00:28:12.824 --> 00:28:14.592
STANDARDS THERE ARE MANY

00:28:14.659 --> 00:28:15.660
CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE THAT IT

00:28:15.727 --> 00:28:17.562
DOESN'T TRULY ENCAPSULATE WHAT

00:28:17.629 --> 00:28:19.130
CHILDREN KNOWING OR ABLE TO DO.

00:28:19.197 --> 00:28:20.732
NOR DOES IT SUPPORT TEACHERS IN

00:28:20.799 --> 00:28:22.233
UNDERSTANDING WHAT STUDENTS

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:23.701
KNOW FOR THE PURPOSES OF

00:28:23.768 --> 00:28:26.671
IMPACTING. THEIR INSTRUCTION OR

00:28:26.738 --> 00:28:27.806
BECOMING INTEGRAL PART OF THEIR

00:28:27.872 --> 00:28:30.041
INSTRUCTION. AND TO THAT END

00:28:30.108 --> 00:28:31.076
THE USEFULNESS OF THE

00:28:31.142 --> 00:28:32.243
INFORMATION THAT ASPECT

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:34.279
PROVIDES COMES INTO QUESTION.

00:28:34.345 --> 00:28:35.280
UNDERSTANDABLE FOR THE

00:28:35.346 --> 00:28:36.481
IMPORTANCE AND NEED FOR

00:28:36.548 --> 00:28:37.682
SOMEBODY FROM AN ASSISTANT

00:28:37.749 --> 00:28:39.751
ASSESSMENT. HOWEVER THE PURPOSE

00:28:39.818 --> 00:28:42.253
OF ASSESSMENT SHOULD BE TO SHOW

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.955
ALWAYS GUIDE INSTRUCTION. I'M

00:28:44.022 --> 00:28:44.689
WHETHER IT'S SOMEONE EVER

00:28:44.756 --> 00:28:46.191
FORMATIVE SUMMATIVE SHOULD BE

00:28:46.257 --> 00:28:47.125
ABLE TO GIVE SPECIFIC

00:28:47.192 --> 00:28:48.460
INFORMATION TO A TEACHER THAT

00:28:48.526 --> 00:28:49.427
WILL BETTER PREPARE THAT

00:28:49.494 --> 00:28:50.829
TEACHERS IMPACT HIS OR HER

00:28:50.895 --> 00:28:52.564
INSTRUCTION. EVEN IF IT'S IN

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:53.698
THE FOLLOWING YEAR NOT WITH THE

00:28:53.765 --> 00:28:54.632
SAME STUDENTS IT DOES GIVE

00:28:54.699 --> 00:28:56.334
INFORMATION TO THE CHILD BUT

00:28:56.401 --> 00:28:58.636
THE WAY IT'S- DELIVERED NOW IS

00:28:58.703 --> 00:29:00.438
NOT VERY USEFUL TO TEACHERS.

00:29:00.505 --> 00:29:01.639
THE REPORTS THAT ARE GENERATED

00:29:01.706 --> 00:29:02.874
FROM THE RESULTS OF THIS TEST

00:29:02.941 --> 00:29:04.342
MIGHT DO NOT PROVIDE CRITICAL

00:29:04.409 --> 00:29:06.511
INFORMATION. AND FOR EXAMPLE IN

00:29:06.578 --> 00:29:07.979
THE AREA OF MATHEMATICS THE

00:29:08.046 --> 00:29:10.115
SCORES ARE BASED ON THREE BANDS

00:29:10.181 --> 00:29:11.850
THERE'S CONCEPT AND PROCEDURES

00:29:11.916 --> 00:29:12.750
THERE'S PROBLEM SOLVING

00:29:12.817 --> 00:29:14.552
MODELING AND DATA ANALYSIS AND

00:29:14.619 --> 00:29:16.087
FINALLY THERE'S COMMUNICATING

00:29:16.154 --> 00:29:17.655
REASONING. AND BECAUSE THESE

00:29:17.722 --> 00:29:18.590
BANDS ARE BROUGHT IN THEIR

00:29:18.656 --> 00:29:21.092
CONTENT QUESTIONS ARE OFTEN-

00:29:21.159 --> 00:29:22.560
MULTIPLE STANDARDS ARE INCLUDED

00:29:22.627 --> 00:29:24.829
IN ONE QUESTION AND AS A RESULT

00:29:24.896 --> 00:29:25.797
IT'S DIFFICULT FOR TEACHERS OR

00:29:25.864 --> 00:29:27.465
ADMINISTRATORS DETERMINE IF AT

00:29:27.532 --> 00:29:30.902
ALL. AND EXACTLY WHAT WHAT IS

00:29:30.969 --> 00:29:32.003
WHAT WITHIN THE BAND IS THE

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:33.271
RELATIVE AREA OF STRENGTH OR

00:29:33.338 --> 00:29:35.607
WEAKNESS. AND THEREFORE IT'S

00:29:35.673 --> 00:29:37.041
DIFFICULT TO FOCUS FUTURE

00:29:37.108 --> 00:29:38.343
INSTRUCTION AND FOR PARENTS

00:29:38.409 --> 00:29:40.378
THAT SOME TO REPORT ONLY GIVES

00:29:40.445 --> 00:29:41.513
GENERAL INFORMATION WITH LINKS

00:29:41.579 --> 00:29:43.515
TO PRACTICE TEST. AND AGAIN NOT

00:29:43.581 --> 00:29:47.385
pAREAS OF DEFICIT THAT NEED

00:29:47.452 --> 00:29:48.653
ADDRESSING. NOT IN TERMS ASMAN

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.221
VERY MIGHT BE A LITTLE STEP

00:29:50.288 --> 00:29:52.056
TOWARDS FORMATIVE- ASSESSMENT

00:29:52.123 --> 00:29:53.925
HOWEVER TEACHERS AREN'T YET

00:29:53.992 --> 00:29:55.360
ABLE TO DIRECTLY ACCESS THE

00:29:55.426 --> 00:29:56.995
RESULTS AT THIS POINT. TAKE

00:29:57.061 --> 00:29:58.596
EITHER INSTRUCTION INSTEAD

00:29:58.663 --> 00:30:00.098
THEIR RESULTS ARE GENERATED BY

00:30:00.165 --> 00:30:02.133
CLASS AND NOT BY GRADE. AND

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.368
THEY'RE GENERATED TO A TESTING

00:30:03.434 --> 00:30:04.502
ADMINISTRATOR WHO THEN HAS TO

00:30:04.569 --> 00:30:06.204
SORT IT OUT. AND THEN PASS THAT

00:30:06.271 --> 00:30:07.572
INFORMATION ON TO THE TEACHERS

00:30:07.639 --> 00:30:08.773
WHO THEN HAVE TO LOOK FOR THEIR

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:09.908
OWN STUDENTS AND THEN MAKE

00:30:09.974 --> 00:30:11.309
SENSE OF WHAT QUESTIONS THEY

00:30:11.376 --> 00:30:13.878
WERE ABLE TO- ANSWER CORRECTLY

00:30:13.945 --> 00:30:16.548
AND NOT. OR NOT AT THE FEEDBACK

00:30:16.614 --> 00:30:18.049
THAT WE RECEIVED IN OUR

00:30:18.116 --> 00:30:20.018
DISTRICT REGARDING THE IN TERMS

00:30:20.084 --> 00:30:21.352
IS FAVORABLE ONLY FOR THE

00:30:21.419 --> 00:30:22.587
PURPOSE OF PRACTICING THE

00:30:22.654 --> 00:30:25.557
TOOLS. ON THE ASPECT BUT HAS

00:30:25.623 --> 00:30:26.824
LACKED IN PROVIDING VALUABLE

00:30:26.891 --> 00:30:28.860
INFORMATION THAT IS NEEDED TO

00:30:28.927 --> 00:30:30.962
GUIDE INSTRUCTION. I TEACHERS

00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:33.665
ALSO REPORT THAT. QUESTIONS CAN

00:30:33.731 --> 00:30:35.967
BE CONFUSING AND AN EXAMPLE IN

00:30:36.034 --> 00:30:37.535
THIRD GRADE AND WHAT IS THE

00:30:37.602 --> 00:30:38.436
LEAST TOLD NUMBER THAT CAN BE

00:30:38.503 --> 00:30:40.738
ROUNDED TO FORTY. SO IT WAS

00:30:40.805 --> 00:30:42.240
INTERESTING BECAUSE AT ONE OF

00:30:42.307 --> 00:30:43.741
OUR HIGHEST PERFORMING SCHOOLS

00:30:43.808 --> 00:30:45.510
IN OUR DISTRICT. HER PERCENT

00:30:45.577 --> 00:30:47.312
THE KIDS MISS THIS QUESTION.

00:30:47.378 --> 00:30:48.780
HOWEVER MULTIPLE OTHER MATTERS

00:30:48.846 --> 00:30:50.381
STUDENTS WERE SHOWING

00:30:50.448 --> 00:30:51.716
PROFICIENCY IN IT SO WE REALLY

00:30:51.783 --> 00:30:54.152
BECAME OF AT AT. A QUESTION

00:30:54.219 --> 00:30:56.421
ABOUT THE LANGUAGE OF THE TEST.

00:30:56.487 --> 00:30:57.355
SO WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT

00:30:57.422 --> 00:30:58.690
CIRCUMSTANCE IS THAT WE START

00:30:58.756 --> 00:31:00.992
TEACHING TO THE TEST. AND NOT

00:31:01.059 --> 00:31:02.460
SOMETHING THAT WE WERE HOPING

00:31:02.527 --> 00:31:03.728
TO GET AWAY FROM WITH THE

00:31:03.795 --> 00:31:07.298
PREVIOUS. MORE MY THERE'S A

00:31:07.365 --> 00:31:08.566
REPORTING THAT. THE SAME

00:31:08.633 --> 00:31:09.434
QUESTION APPEAR IN THE ASP HERE

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:10.501
AFTER YEAR WHICH I THINK I

00:31:10.568 --> 00:31:11.536
DON'T BELIEVE WAS THE ORIGINAL

00:31:11.603 --> 00:31:13.671
INTENT OF THE S. BACK. AND I

00:31:13.738 --> 00:31:14.606
SAID I THINK YOU MENTIONED

00:31:14.672 --> 00:31:16.908
BEFORE MAKE IT- YOU KNOW THE

00:31:16.975 --> 00:31:18.409
PURPOSE OF COMMON CORE WAS TO

00:31:18.476 --> 00:31:19.143
REALLY GET OUR KIDS TO

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:20.878
COLLABORATE NEST RICH DEEP RICH

00:31:20.945 --> 00:31:22.580
PROBLEM SOLVING TASKS AND HAVE

00:31:22.647 --> 00:31:24.015
COMMUNICATION BUT THEN

00:31:24.082 --> 00:31:24.816
ULTIMATELY THEY'RE ASSESSED IN

00:31:24.882 --> 00:31:26.084
A DIFFERENT WAY. SO THERE'S

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:27.986
LESS TIME ON THAT COLLABORATION

00:31:28.052 --> 00:31:29.621
AND MORE TIME ON PRACTICING FOR

00:31:29.687 --> 00:31:32.423
THAT TEST. AND FOR US CULTURAL

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:33.691
SENSITIVITY FOR OUR STUDENTS

00:31:33.758 --> 00:31:35.193
AND TAKING THE TEST IS A HUGE

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.161
CONCERN- THERE'S GROWING

00:31:37.228 --> 00:31:39.364
ATTENTION AND FRANKLY I NEED TO

00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:40.365
ENSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS HAVE.

00:31:40.431 --> 00:31:42.767
EQUITABLE ACCESS. TO EDUCATION

00:31:42.834 --> 00:31:44.335
OPPORTUNITY EQUITY DOESN'T MEAN

00:31:44.402 --> 00:31:46.604
THAT EVERYBODY IS EQUAL RATHER

00:31:46.671 --> 00:31:47.238
IT MEANS THAT STUDENTS GET WHAT

00:31:47.305 --> 00:31:48.673
THEY NEED. SO MANY OF OUR

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.041
STUDENTS ARE EXPECTED TO TAKE

00:31:50.108 --> 00:31:51.676
THE ASPECT BEFORE THEY BECOME

00:31:51.743 --> 00:31:53.978
FLUENT ENGLISH SPEAKERS. AND

00:31:54.045 --> 00:31:55.113
WHICH ONLY REALLY ASSESSES

00:31:55.179 --> 00:31:56.147
THEIR LANGUAGE ACQUISITION

00:31:56.214 --> 00:31:58.583
AUTHOR UNDERSTAND THE CONTENT

00:31:58.650 --> 00:31:59.017
WE DO APPRECIATE THE

00:31:59.083 --> 00:32:00.952
ACCOMMODATIONS- THAT ARE

00:32:01.019 --> 00:32:02.720
AVAILABLE THIS TEXT TO SPEECH

00:32:02.787 --> 00:32:04.055
FOR EXAMPLE OR THE POP UP

00:32:04.122 --> 00:32:05.490
GLOSSARIES. HOWEVER THESE ARE

00:32:05.556 --> 00:32:07.191
NOT YET UNIVERSAL'S TOOLS FOR

00:32:07.258 --> 00:32:08.960
ALL STUDENTS AND THEIR YET TO

00:32:09.027 --> 00:32:10.962
BE GIVEN IN ITS ENTIRETY IN THE

00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:12.664
STUDENTS HOME LANGUAGE.

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:13.865
ADDITIONALLY THE CONTEXT OF

00:32:13.931 --> 00:32:15.900
SOME THE QUESTIONS WHILE THEY

00:32:15.967 --> 00:32:17.735
ARE REAL WORLD AND WE DO

00:32:17.802 --> 00:32:20.938
APPRECIATE THAT AND SLEEPY. AND

00:32:21.005 --> 00:32:23.141
DATE DEPT THEY SOMETIMES FALL

00:32:23.207 --> 00:32:24.609
OUTSIDE THE EXPERIENCE OF OUR

00:32:24.676 --> 00:32:25.843
STUDENTS AND POVERTY FOR

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:26.911
EXAMPLE IN FIFTH GRADE

00:32:26.978 --> 00:32:29.113
MATHEMATICS ASSESSMENT STUDENTS

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:30.515
ARE ASKED TO PLAN A DAY AT THE

00:32:30.581 --> 00:32:32.350
FAIR. AND WE AGREED TO KEEP

00:32:32.417 --> 00:32:33.851
THIS QUESTION TO ASSESS PREPARE

00:32:33.918 --> 00:32:35.987
IMPRIMATUR HOWEVER MANY

00:32:36.054 --> 00:32:36.888
STUDENTS HAVE NEVER HAD THE

00:32:36.954 --> 00:32:39.290
OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO A FAIR.

00:32:39.357 --> 00:32:41.659
AND THEREFORE NO ACCESS TO THE

00:32:41.726 --> 00:32:42.994
VERY PREMISE OF THE QUESTION

00:32:43.061 --> 00:32:45.029
WHICH THEN MAKES THE QUESTION

00:32:45.096 --> 00:32:46.898
IS EQUITABLE FOR ALL STUDENTS.

00:32:46.964 --> 00:32:48.633
TO ADD ON OUR IMPROPER STUDENTS

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.835
ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY MAY AND

00:32:50.902 --> 00:32:52.437
MANY IF NOT MOST CASES BE

00:32:52.503 --> 00:32:54.238
GREATLY LIMITED AND THEREFORE

00:32:54.305 --> 00:32:55.373
DEPENDS ON THE FUNDING AT THE

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.108
DISTRICT LEVEL OR THE SITE

00:32:57.175 --> 00:32:58.643
LEVEL. BECAUSE THE TOOLS ON

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:01.012
ASPECT REQUIRE PRACTICE THIS

00:33:01.079 --> 00:33:03.314
ONCE AGAIN. ONCE AGAIN POSES AN

00:33:03.381 --> 00:33:04.982
EQUITY ISSUE FOR STUDENTS THIS

00:33:05.049 --> 00:33:06.818
IS ESPECIALLY THE CASE WHEN

00:33:06.884 --> 00:33:08.353
LOOKING AT A GROWING BODY OF

00:33:08.419 --> 00:33:09.954
COMPETING RESEARCH EXAM FINANCE

00:33:10.021 --> 00:33:11.823
SCREEN TIME IN THE CLASSROOM.

00:33:11.889 --> 00:33:13.925
CAN ACTUALLY BE INHIBITORY TO

00:33:13.991 --> 00:33:16.127
STUDENT LEARNING. EXCEPTIONALLY

00:33:16.194 --> 00:33:18.529
WELL WELL INTENTIONED S. BACK

00:33:18.596 --> 00:33:20.365
DOES BECOME A TEST OF STAMINA.

00:33:20.431 --> 00:33:21.899
SPECIFICALLY AT THE ELEMENTARY

00:33:21.966 --> 00:33:24.369
LEVEL WE'RE ASKING OUR EIGHT TO

00:33:24.435 --> 00:33:26.204
ELEVEN YEAR OLDS TO SPEND FOUR

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:28.072
TO FIVE DATE IS TWO TO THREE.

00:33:28.139 --> 00:33:29.540
HOURS EACH DAY TAKING THIS

00:33:29.607 --> 00:33:31.709
TEST. RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT

00:33:31.776 --> 00:33:32.810
THE AVERAGE STUDENTS OUR

00:33:32.877 --> 00:33:34.011
STUDENTS HAVE A SUSTAINED

00:33:34.078 --> 00:33:36.414
ATTENTION SPAN. OF THREE TO

00:33:36.481 --> 00:33:37.515
FIVE MINUTES FOR EVERY YEAR

00:33:37.582 --> 00:33:39.884
THEY ARE ALIVE SO THE AVERAGE

00:33:39.951 --> 00:33:41.486
NINE YEAR OLD IN THIRD GRADE

00:33:41.552 --> 00:33:42.353
WOULD HAVE AN- ATTENTION SPAN

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:44.389
BETWEEN TWENTY SEVEN FORTY

00:33:44.455 --> 00:33:45.990
MINUTES. IT'S NOT UNTIL SEVENTH

00:33:46.057 --> 00:33:47.325
GRADE AT A CHILD AT THE HIGHER

00:33:47.392 --> 00:33:48.459
END OF THE NORMAL RANGE WOULD

00:33:48.526 --> 00:33:50.228
HAVE ROUGHLY A SIXTY MINUTE

00:33:50.294 --> 00:33:52.997
ATTENTION SPAN. AND MAYBE ARGUE

00:33:53.064 --> 00:33:54.732
THAT ASPECT ALLOWS FOR TESTING

00:33:54.799 --> 00:33:55.433
WINDOW THAT WOULD SHORTEN

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.001
TESTING ON A GIVEN DAY HOWEVER

00:33:57.068 --> 00:33:59.270
THERE ANY ARE VERY. THERE ARE

00:33:59.337 --> 00:34:00.405
MANY INHIBITORY FACTORS THAT

00:34:00.471 --> 00:34:01.973
PREVENTS THIS INCLUDING

00:34:02.039 --> 00:34:03.808
DISTRICT PASTING CALENDARS

00:34:03.875 --> 00:34:06.344
DEVICES ACCESS TO DEVICES AND

00:34:06.411 --> 00:34:07.011
THE CHALLENGE OF STOPPING

00:34:07.078 --> 00:34:09.046
RETURN ON COMPUTER ADAPTIVE

00:34:09.113 --> 00:34:11.749
PORTION OF THE ASSESSMENT. ONE

00:34:11.816 --> 00:34:15.987
LAST GOING TO SWITCH OUT HERE.

00:34:16.053 --> 00:34:17.789
ONE LAST CONCERN CONSERVING- S.

00:34:17.855 --> 00:34:19.290
BACK AND- YES THERE ARE

00:34:19.357 --> 00:34:20.291
MULTIPLE DAYS THAT THE TEST IS

00:34:20.358 --> 00:34:22.593
ADMINISTERED BUT EACH DAY IS A

00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:24.028
DIFFERENT PORTION OF THE TEST

00:34:24.095 --> 00:34:26.030
THAT CAN LAST FOR MANY ANYTIME

00:34:26.097 --> 00:34:27.765
FROM ONE TO THREE HOURS. AND

00:34:27.832 --> 00:34:29.700
FOR EACH PART PORTION STUDENTS

00:34:29.767 --> 00:34:32.103
GET ONE SHOT AT IT NOW. FOR

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:34.105
THINGS LIKE THE ACT AND THE SAT

00:34:34.172 --> 00:34:36.407
IN THE ELSE AT. THOSE KINDS OF

00:34:36.474 --> 00:34:37.475
ASSESSMENT A HOST OF OTHER

00:34:37.542 --> 00:34:38.910
STUDENTS ARE ALLOWED TO RETAKE

00:34:38.976 --> 00:34:40.211
THE ASSESSMENT AS MANY TIMES AS

00:34:40.278 --> 00:34:42.480
THEY LIKE NOW WE'RE NOT

00:34:42.547 --> 00:34:43.881
ESPOUSING EIGHT AND ELEVEN YEAR

00:34:43.948 --> 00:34:45.383
OLDS TO TAKE FIFTEEN OUR TEST

00:34:45.450 --> 00:34:47.485
MULTIPLE TIMES BUT- THIS IS

00:34:47.552 --> 00:34:50.121
HIGH TECH HIGH STAKES TESTING.

00:34:50.188 --> 00:34:52.323
AND MUCH RIDES ON THESE RESULTS

00:34:52.390 --> 00:34:54.158
SO WOULD IT BE GREAT IF WE WERE

00:34:54.225 --> 00:34:55.626
ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR OPTIMAL

00:34:55.693 --> 00:34:57.862
CONDITIONS TO TRULY ASSESS

00:34:57.929 --> 00:34:59.864
PROGRESS OVER TIME. AS TO WHAT

00:34:59.931 --> 00:35:03.634
STUDENTS KNOW. NOT IDEAS FOR

00:35:03.701 --> 00:35:04.569
IMPROVEMENT AS WE STATED BEFORE

00:35:04.635 --> 00:35:06.571
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY PURPOSE AN

00:35:06.637 --> 00:35:08.439
IMPORTANT IN MEASURING A

00:35:08.506 --> 00:35:08.973
STUDENT'S LEARNING OVER A

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.608
YEAR'S TIME HOWEVER. THERE'S

00:35:10.675 --> 00:35:12.276
MUCH THAT CAN BE DONE TO YIELD

00:35:12.343 --> 00:35:13.845
THE MOST ACCURATE MEASURE.

00:35:13.911 --> 00:35:15.880
ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS ABOUT

00:35:15.947 --> 00:35:16.914
THAT WE JUST MENTIONED WE

00:35:16.981 --> 00:35:18.549
BELIEVE WOULD DEFINITELY WORK

00:35:18.616 --> 00:35:19.484
TOWARDS BETTER UNDERSTANDING

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:21.352
WHAT STUDENTS ACTUALLY NO AND

00:35:21.419 --> 00:35:23.221
WHAT THEY'RE ABLE TO DO.

00:35:23.287 --> 00:35:23.921
THERE'S NO DOUBT IN OUR MINDS

00:35:23.988 --> 00:35:26.157
THAT THAT THIS HIGH TAKES THIS

00:35:26.224 --> 00:35:28.125
HIGH STAKES TEST HAS AT THE

00:35:28.192 --> 00:35:29.827
MINIMUM MADE STRIDES TOWARD

00:35:29.894 --> 00:35:31.429
TECHNOLOGY THE NEED FOR

00:35:31.496 --> 00:35:33.631
STUDENTS TO THINK DEEPLY AND

00:35:33.698 --> 00:35:35.333
CRITICALLY. BUT WE WONDER IS

00:35:35.399 --> 00:35:35.933
ARE WE REALLY ASKING THE RIGHT

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.135
QUESTION HERE- TO BETTER

00:35:38.202 --> 00:35:39.470
SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS IN

00:35:39.537 --> 00:35:40.037
LEARNING AND ASSESSING WHAT

00:35:40.104 --> 00:35:41.873
THEY'VE LEARNED. THE PROGRAM OF

00:35:41.939 --> 00:35:42.773
INTERNATIONAL STUDENT

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:43.674
ASSESSMENT WHICH IS KNOWN AS

00:35:43.741 --> 00:35:45.977
PISA. HAS PROVEN THAT WE HAVE

00:35:46.043 --> 00:35:47.278
AS A COUNTRY MADE LITTLE

00:35:47.345 --> 00:35:48.980
IMPROVEMENT PRUDENT. SINCE ITS

00:35:49.046 --> 00:35:51.015
EXCEPTION IN TO THE YEAR TWO

00:35:51.082 --> 00:35:52.483
THOUSAND. EVEN WITH THE

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:53.784
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMMON

00:35:53.851 --> 00:35:55.720
CORE STANDARDS IN TWO THOUSAND

00:35:55.786 --> 00:35:56.787
TEN WHICH ATTEMPTED TO BETTER

00:35:56.854 --> 00:35:57.922
PREPARE STUDENTS FOR THE TWENTY

00:35:57.989 --> 00:35:59.423
FIRST CENTURY AND FOR THE JOBS

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:00.358
THAT DEMANDED CRITICAL

00:36:00.424 --> 00:36:01.759
THINKING. COLLABORATION

00:36:01.826 --> 00:36:04.328
CREATIVITY AND COMMUNICATION WE

00:36:04.395 --> 00:36:05.663
STILL HAVE REMAINED STAGNANT

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:09.133
AND FAR. FAR BEHIND DEVELOPED

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.402
COUNTRIES YEAR AFTER YEAR. SO

00:36:11.469 --> 00:36:13.504
WE KNOW THE WHAT. THAT'S

00:36:13.571 --> 00:36:15.072
CLEARLY COMMUNICATED BUT WHAT

00:36:15.139 --> 00:36:18.809
WE FELT THAT IS THE HOUSE. THAT

00:36:18.876 --> 00:36:21.012
IS THE HOUSE HOW DO WE DEVELOP

00:36:21.078 --> 00:36:22.914
OUR TEACHERS AND HIGH QUALITY

00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:25.716
RESOURCES. TO SUPPORT LEARNING

00:36:25.783 --> 00:36:26.918
THE STUDENTS IN BECOMING THE

00:36:26.984 --> 00:36:28.486
CRITICAL THINKING THINKERS AND

00:36:28.553 --> 00:36:30.388
PROBLEM SOLVERS FOR THE JOBS

00:36:30.454 --> 00:36:32.290
THAT DEMAND THESE VERY SKILLS.

00:36:32.356 --> 00:36:33.558
NOW WE KNOW FROM THE NATIONAL

00:36:33.624 --> 00:36:34.525
INSTITUTE OF SCHOOL LEADERSHIP

00:36:34.592 --> 00:36:36.260
AND FROM EXTENSIVE RESEARCH AND

00:36:36.327 --> 00:36:37.395
HOW PEOPLE LEARNED THAT THE

00:36:37.461 --> 00:36:38.763
GREATEST IMPACT ON STUDENT

00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:39.864
ACHIEVEMENT IS THROUGH

00:36:39.931 --> 00:36:42.233
EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTION AND

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:43.134
FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT THAT'S

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.336
BEEN PROVEN. ASPECT HAS MADE AN

00:36:45.403 --> 00:36:46.237
ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS THE

00:36:46.304 --> 00:36:47.438
FORMATIVE PIECE HOWEVER THIS

00:36:47.505 --> 00:36:49.607
MUCH TO BE IMPROVED TO TRULY

00:36:49.674 --> 00:36:51.609
INFORM INSTRUCTION. BUT WE'VE

00:36:51.676 --> 00:36:53.277
DONE LITTLE TO NOTHING AT THE

00:36:53.344 --> 00:36:55.446
NATIONAL OR STATE LEVEL TO

00:36:55.513 --> 00:36:57.848
ADDRESS THE INSTRUCTIONAL PIECE.

00:36:57.915 --> 00:36:58.883
IF THINK EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNTS

00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:00.051
OF MONEY THAT IT COSTS TO

00:37:00.117 --> 00:37:01.419
ADMINISTER IT TO ADMINISTER

00:37:01.485 --> 00:37:03.454
STANDARDIZED TEST. THAT FOR THE

00:37:03.521 --> 00:37:04.922
MOST PART IS SUMMATIVE COULD

00:37:04.989 --> 00:37:06.057
INSTEAD BE PUT TOWARDS

00:37:06.123 --> 00:37:07.158
FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT THAT

00:37:07.224 --> 00:37:09.093
TEACHERS CAN ACTUALLY USE AND

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:09.727
ARE HELPFUL AND CAN BE APPLIED

00:37:09.794 --> 00:37:12.163
TO PRACTICE. IN IT AND BE PUT

00:37:12.229 --> 00:37:13.431
TOWARDS TO SUPPORTING

00:37:13.497 --> 00:37:14.365
PROFESSIONAL LEARNING AND

00:37:14.432 --> 00:37:15.700
TEACHERS WE COULD IN FACT BE

00:37:15.766 --> 00:37:17.468
MAKING A SIGNIFICANT

00:37:17.535 --> 00:37:19.670
DIFFERENCE. IN STUDENT LEARNING.

00:37:19.737 --> 00:37:21.339
WHEN YOU THE CLIP ART TEACHERS.

00:37:21.405 --> 00:37:22.707
IN BECOMING MATHEMATICS AND

00:37:22.773 --> 00:37:24.742
LITERACY EXPERTS. WE NEED TO

00:37:24.809 --> 00:37:25.743
RAISE THEIR CONTENT AND

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:27.612
PEDAGOGICAL KNOWLEDGE AS WELL

00:37:27.678 --> 00:37:28.446
AS OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE BEST

00:37:28.512 --> 00:37:30.648
INSTRUCTIONAL PRACTICE SO HIGH.

00:37:30.715 --> 00:37:31.582
THAT THEY CAN MAKE THE BEST

00:37:31.649 --> 00:37:32.683
INSTRUCTIONAL DECISIONS TO

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:33.751
SUPPORT THE STUDENTS IN

00:37:33.818 --> 00:37:35.519
OBTAINING THE SKILLS. THAT THEY

00:37:35.586 --> 00:37:36.621
REQUIRED FOR THE TWENTY FIRST

00:37:36.687 --> 00:37:39.624
CENTURY. THAT WOULD TRULY BE A

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:40.024
HIGH QUALITY ALIGN

00:37:40.091 --> 00:37:42.093
INSTRUCTIONAL SYSTEM. IT TOO WE

00:37:42.159 --> 00:37:44.462
ADDRESS THE HOW UNTIL WE GET

00:37:44.528 --> 00:37:45.930
BETTER AT THIS PIECE WILL NOT

00:37:45.997 --> 00:37:47.531
MOVE THE NEEDLE ON THE STATE

00:37:47.598 --> 00:37:48.599
THE NATIONAL OR THE

00:37:48.666 --> 00:37:50.267
INTERNATIONAL LEVEL. THANK YOU.

FOR THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS

00:38:09.487 --> 00:38:12.256
ASSOCIATION. BUT TODAY I SPEAK

00:38:12.323 --> 00:38:15.459
AS AN INDIVIDUAL. WITH TWENTY

00:38:15.526 --> 00:38:17.161
SEVEN SCHOOL SITES AND FORTY

00:38:17.228 --> 00:38:17.995
THOUSAND STUDENTS THE KERN HIGH

00:38:18.062 --> 00:38:19.830
SCHOOL DISTRICT IS THE LARGEST

00:38:19.897 --> 00:38:20.998
SINGLE HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT IN

00:38:21.065 --> 00:38:23.134
THE STATE. AT MY SITE GOLDEN

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.403
VALLEY HIGH WE HAVE TWENTY FIVE

00:38:25.469 --> 00:38:27.371
HUNDRED STUDENTS. 85% OF WHICH

00:38:27.438 --> 00:38:29.407
ARE HISPANIC 90% OF WHICH ARE

00:38:29.473 --> 00:38:30.608
SOCIO ECONOMICALLY

00:38:30.675 --> 00:38:33.110
DISADVANTAGED. THEREFORE MY

00:38:33.177 --> 00:38:35.079
FRUSTRATION WITH THE S. BACK

00:38:35.146 --> 00:38:38.049
WAS WITH ITS TEACHER RESOURCES.

00:38:38.115 --> 00:38:39.950
THE ORIGINAL ROLL OUT OF THE

00:38:40.017 --> 00:38:42.753
DIGITAL LIBRARY WAS MYSTERIOUS

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:44.288
THERE WAS GOSSIP ABOUT A FEW

00:38:44.355 --> 00:38:45.723
TEACHERS BEING ABLE TO ACCESS

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:47.958
SOME. DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE

00:38:48.025 --> 00:38:49.727
WEBSITE DENSELY PACKED WITH

00:38:49.794 --> 00:38:51.862
LESS THAN USEFUL AND LESS THAN

00:38:51.929 --> 00:38:54.331
USER FRIENDLY MATERIAL AND

00:38:54.398 --> 00:38:55.332
THERE WAS LITTLE TRAINING A

00:38:55.399 --> 00:38:56.901
LITTLE UNDERSTANDING OF THE

00:38:56.967 --> 00:38:58.869
ENTIRE SYSTEM HENCE. WE WERE

00:38:58.936 --> 00:39:00.504
FRUSTRATED THAT WE SHARED OUR

00:39:00.571 --> 00:39:01.472
CRITICISM ABOUT THE

00:39:01.539 --> 00:39:03.140
DISCONNECTED DATA AND THE

00:39:03.207 --> 00:39:05.142
UNCLEAR UNUSABLE LESSON PLANS

00:39:05.209 --> 00:39:07.278
ON THE SITE. AND I BELIEVE WE

00:39:07.344 --> 00:39:08.813
WERE HURT THE TEACHERS IN THE

00:39:08.879 --> 00:39:10.114
CLASSROOM WHO HAD TO USE THIS

00:39:10.181 --> 00:39:12.516
SYSTEM- WERE HEARD REGARDING

00:39:12.583 --> 00:39:14.518
THE DIGITAL LIBRARY WHAT WE NOW

00:39:14.585 --> 00:39:15.753
NEED FROM THE NEW SYSTEM

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:18.522
INCLUDES. A LIST OF SPECIFIC

00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:20.291
SKILLS BEING ADDRESSED AT EACH

00:39:20.357 --> 00:39:21.625
GRADE LEVEL AND WITH THEIR

00:39:21.692 --> 00:39:22.893
RESPECTIVE ALIGNMENT TO THE

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:25.229
COMMON CORE STANDARDS OUR

00:39:25.296 --> 00:39:27.898
TEACHERS WERE SO CONFUSED BY

00:39:27.965 --> 00:39:29.633
THE DIGITAL LIBRARY WE NEED

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:31.035
MORE SOURCES SOLVE THE- WHIMS

00:39:31.102 --> 00:39:33.370
JENNA. ERIN LEE IN THE US BACK

00:39:33.437 --> 00:39:34.905
SO HAVE WEBSITE WE CAN HE AND

00:39:34.972 --> 00:39:36.407
NAVIGATE WITH SKILLS AND

00:39:36.474 --> 00:39:39.610
STANDARDS THAT WERE TESTED WILL

00:39:39.677 --> 00:39:40.845
HELP RESOLVE THIS FRUSTRATION.

00:39:40.911 --> 00:39:42.346
USABE INTERIM AND FORMATIVE

00:39:42.413 --> 00:39:44.048
ASSESSMENTS DIRECTLY TIED TO

00:39:44.115 --> 00:39:45.683
SKILLS AND GRADE LEVELS AS WELL

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:48.018
AND BY USABLE I MEAN TO INFORM

00:39:48.085 --> 00:39:49.854
INSTRUCTION. OUR NINTH AND

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.322
TENTH GRADE TEACHERS HAD NO

00:39:51.388 --> 00:39:52.723
DATA TO ANALYZE ONLY THE

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:54.425
ELEVENTH GRADE TEACHERS TESTING

00:39:54.492 --> 00:39:56.460
THE US BACKED IT WITHOUT DATA

00:39:56.527 --> 00:39:57.261
ARE NINE TO TENTH GRADE

00:39:57.328 --> 00:39:59.196
TEACHERS WERE FLYING BLIND.

00:39:59.263 --> 00:40:01.198
ALSO THE OLD DATA WAS NOT

00:40:01.265 --> 00:40:02.466
HELPFUL WHEN FOR EXAMPLE

00:40:02.533 --> 00:40:04.735
READING RESULTS CAME OUT. BUT

00:40:04.802 --> 00:40:06.036
HAD NO INDICATORS FOR WHICH

00:40:06.103 --> 00:40:07.905
SPECIFIC READING SKILLS TESTED

00:40:07.972 --> 00:40:10.708
MAIN IDEA SUPPORTING DETAILS

00:40:10.775 --> 00:40:12.376
INFERENCE. WHEN THE DATA IS

00:40:12.443 --> 00:40:14.011
ALIGNED TO COMMON CORE

00:40:14.078 --> 00:40:15.379
STANDARDS IT DOES FURTHER

00:40:15.446 --> 00:40:16.947
INFORM TEACHERS TO IDENTIFY BUT

00:40:17.014 --> 00:40:18.382
ONLY WITH EACH STUDENT NEEDS.

00:40:18.449 --> 00:40:20.251
WHAT DIRECTION SCHOOLS CAN MOVE

00:40:20.317 --> 00:40:22.153
THEIR GLOBAL INSTRUCTIONAL

00:40:22.219 --> 00:40:22.720
PATTERNS IN THEIR CURRICULUM

00:40:22.787 --> 00:40:25.756
MAPS. WE ALSO NEED MORE

00:40:25.823 --> 00:40:27.625
TRAINING ON THE SYSTEM.

TRAINING AND RESOURCES NEEDED

00:43:58.202 --> 00:44:00.270
NEEDED TO ENABLE OUR TEACHERS

TO IMPLEMENT THE STANDARDS AND

00:44:01.271 --> 00:44:03.974
FRAMEWORKS. TO BENEFIT STUDENTS

00:44:04.041 --> 00:44:06.243
TO IMPROVE EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES

00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:08.245
FOR ALL STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF

IDENTITY HOME LANGUAGE OR

00:44:15.219 --> 00:44:17.354
CITIZENSHIP STATUS. OKAY I

00:44:17.421 --> 00:44:19.289
BELIEVE THAT WE ALL AGREE THAT

00:44:19.356 --> 00:44:20.591
THE CALIFORNIA ASSESSMENT

00:44:20.657 --> 00:44:23.260
SYSTEM SHOULD LEAD TO IMPROVED

00:44:23.327 --> 00:44:25.262
EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES FOR ALL

00:44:25.329 --> 00:44:28.399
STUDENTS. WITH THAT SAID I

00:44:28.465 --> 00:44:30.501
BELIEVE SOME THAT THE CHALLENGE

00:44:30.567 --> 00:44:32.569
WE'RE FACING TODAY IS THAT SOME

00:44:32.636 --> 00:44:34.304
THE TO THE SUBSTANCE BY NATURE

00:44:34.371 --> 00:44:35.606
PROVIDE TEACHERS WITH

00:44:35.672 --> 00:44:37.508
INFORMATION ON WHETHER STUDENTS

00:44:37.574 --> 00:44:39.376
HAVE CLEARED AND IDENTIFIED

00:44:39.443 --> 00:44:41.678
LEARNING BAR BUT THEY DO NOT

00:44:41.745 --> 00:44:43.847
PROVIDE CLASSROOM TEACHERS WITH

00:44:43.914 --> 00:44:45.249
INFORMATION ON HOW TO GET THE

00:44:45.315 --> 00:44:47.484
STUDENTS. OVER THE BAR SO FOR

00:44:47.551 --> 00:44:48.719
EXAMPLE IF I WERE TO PUT UP A

00:44:48.786 --> 00:44:51.188
HIGH JUMP IN HERE AND I SET THE

00:44:51.255 --> 00:44:52.423
STANDARD FOR ALL OF YOU IT'S A

00:44:52.489 --> 00:44:55.793
CLEAR FIVE FEET. I HAVE THE BAR

00:44:55.859 --> 00:44:57.428
AND IT'S NOW UP TO ME TO TRY TO

00:44:57.494 --> 00:44:58.395
FIGURE OUT HOW TO TRAIN YOU

00:44:58.462 --> 00:44:59.863
GIVEN YOUR FITNESS LEVELS TO

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:01.331
GET OVER THE BAR. THE

00:45:01.398 --> 00:45:03.667
ASSESSMENT ITSELF THE STANDARD

00:45:03.734 --> 00:45:04.268
ITSELF DOES NOT TELL ME HOW TO

00:45:04.334 --> 00:45:06.437
DO THAT. IN MY OPINION THEN THE

00:45:06.503 --> 00:45:08.505
GREATEST CHALLENGE THE US BACK

00:45:08.572 --> 00:45:10.774
SYSTEM. HAS HAS BEEN ACTUALLY

00:45:10.841 --> 00:45:12.776
THE STATE WIDE OUTCOMES. NOT

00:45:12.843 --> 00:45:13.777
SURE THIS WITH YOU BECAUSE IF

00:45:13.844 --> 00:45:15.279
WE DO WE IF THE INTENT OF OUR

00:45:15.345 --> 00:45:17.147
SYSTEM WAS TO IMPROVE

00:45:17.214 --> 00:45:18.982
EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES FOR ALL

00:45:19.049 --> 00:45:21.985
STUDENTS. THEN WHY IS IT THAT

00:45:22.052 --> 00:45:24.388
28% ONLY TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT.

00:45:24.455 --> 00:45:25.322
OF OUR ECONOMICALLY

00:45:25.389 --> 00:45:26.523
DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS. ARE

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:27.291
MEETING THE CALIFORNIA

00:45:27.357 --> 00:45:29.159
STANDARDS FOR MATHEMATICS WHY

00:45:29.226 --> 00:45:31.295
IS IT THAT ONLY 21% OF OUR

00:45:31.361 --> 00:45:33.130
AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS. ARE

00:45:33.197 --> 00:45:34.131
MEETING THE STANDARDS FOR

00:45:34.198 --> 00:45:34.698
MATHEMATICS THE CALIFORNIA

00:45:34.765 --> 00:45:36.400
STANDARDS. AND WHY IS IT THAT

00:45:36.467 --> 00:45:38.268
ALL THAT ONLY 20% OF OUR LET

00:45:38.335 --> 00:45:39.636
NEXT STUDENTS. ARE MEETING THE

00:45:39.703 --> 00:45:41.839
STANDARDS SO. THAT WAS THE BILL

00:45:41.905 --> 00:45:42.873
THE SYSTEM WITH THE A PETITION

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:44.541
COME A QUARTER WAS IN CREW WAS

00:45:44.608 --> 00:45:45.876
TO CREATE MORE EQUITABLE ACT

00:45:45.943 --> 00:45:47.811
OUTCOMES. WE OUGHT TO ALL

00:45:47.878 --> 00:45:49.446
RECOGNIZE THAT WERE FALLING-

00:45:49.513 --> 00:45:54.218
WERE FALLING SHORT. ON THIS.

00:45:54.284 --> 00:45:55.352
I'M NOT BLAMING THE ASSESSMENT

00:45:55.419 --> 00:45:57.154
SYSTEM- FOR PRODUCING SUCH

00:45:57.221 --> 00:45:58.288
DISPARATE OUTCOMES BY STUDENT

00:45:58.355 --> 00:45:59.656
GROUPS. BUT WE HAVE TO

00:45:59.723 --> 00:46:01.325
ACKNOWLEDGE TO OURSELVES BUT IF

00:46:01.391 --> 00:46:02.526
THE NEW STANDARDS AND THE

00:46:02.593 --> 00:46:04.261
SYSTEM SYSTEM WAS SUPPOSED TO

00:46:04.328 --> 00:46:06.964
BE TRANSFORMATIVE. WE HAVE THE

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:08.632
LEAST TO DATE COME UP SHORT.

00:46:08.699 --> 00:46:10.033
NOW JOHN HARDY IS ONE OF THE

00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:11.368
LEADING EDUCATIONAL RESEARCHERS

00:46:11.435 --> 00:46:12.703
IN THE PLANET TODAY. AND HE

00:46:12.769 --> 00:46:14.738
EXPLAINS THE TEACHER COLLECTIVE

00:46:14.805 --> 00:46:16.940
EFFICACY HAS THE GREATEST

00:46:17.007 --> 00:46:19.343
IMPACT ON STUDENT LEARNING. HOW

00:46:19.409 --> 00:46:20.244
THE STATE'S IT'S ESSENTIAL TO

00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:22.212
HELP EDUCATORS MAKE THE LINK

00:46:22.279 --> 00:46:23.714
BETWEEN THEIR COLLECTIVE

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:26.483
ACTIONS. AND STUDENT OUTCOMES

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:27.518
THEY NEED TO HEAR FROM THE

00:46:27.584 --> 00:46:28.852
STUDENTS MEAN THE TEACHERS

00:46:28.919 --> 00:46:29.987
ABOUT THE STUDENTS LEARNING

00:46:30.053 --> 00:46:31.855
THEIR PROGRESS THEIR STRUGGLES

00:46:31.922 --> 00:46:33.257
AND THEIR MOTIVATION TO KEEP

00:46:33.323 --> 00:46:34.625
LEARNING. TEACHERS NEED TO

00:46:34.691 --> 00:46:36.527
EXAMINE STUDENT ARTIFACTS SUCH

00:46:36.593 --> 00:46:39.163
AS ASSIGNMENTS TESTS PORTFOLIOS

00:46:39.229 --> 00:46:40.564
AND OTHER INDICATORS OFDAILY

00:46:40.631 --> 00:46:42.032
PROGRESS WITH ALL THESE

00:46:42.099 --> 00:46:43.734
ACTIVITIES THE KEY IS MAKING

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:45.602
THE LINK BETWEEN THE TEACHERS

00:46:45.669 --> 00:46:47.371
ACTIONS. AND THE STUDENTS

00:46:47.437 --> 00:46:49.506
OUTCOMES EXPLICIT SO THE

00:46:49.573 --> 00:46:50.908
TEACHERS UNDERSTAND THAT THE

00:46:50.974 --> 00:46:52.743
FACTORS BEHIND STUDENT PROGRESS

00:46:52.809 --> 00:46:54.845
ARE WITHIN THEIR COLLECTIVE

00:46:54.912 --> 00:46:56.446
SPHERE OF INFLUENCE. HOW DOES

00:46:56.513 --> 00:46:57.648
RESEARCH IMPLIES THAT THIS THIS

00:46:57.714 --> 00:46:59.116
HEARING TODAY THAT IF THE

00:46:59.183 --> 00:47:01.818
ASPECT ASSESSMENTS DO NOT HELP

00:47:01.885 --> 00:47:04.621
EDUCATORS MAKE A LINK BETWEEN

00:47:04.688 --> 00:47:05.556
THEIR COLLECTIVE CLASSROOM

00:47:05.622 --> 00:47:07.457
ACTIONS. AND STUDENT LEARNING

00:47:07.524 --> 00:47:08.825
OUTCOMES THINK TEACHERS WILL

00:47:08.892 --> 00:47:10.527
NOT KNOW HOW TO ADJUST THEIR

00:47:10.594 --> 00:47:12.462
TEACHING PRACTICES IN A WAY

00:47:12.529 --> 00:47:14.131
THAT LEADS TO MODIFIED OR

00:47:14.198 --> 00:47:16.200
TEACHER ACTIONS TO EXPLICITLY

00:47:16.266 --> 00:47:17.134
IMPROVE STUDENT LEARNING

00:47:17.201 --> 00:47:18.969
OUTCOMES. WHILE SOME OF

00:47:19.036 --> 00:47:20.437
ASSESSMENTS ARE REQUIRED UNDER

00:47:20.504 --> 00:47:22.105
ASSET AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER

00:47:22.172 --> 00:47:23.574
THIS SOME ASSESSMENTS FALL

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:25.842
SHORT OF PROVIDING TEACHERS

00:47:25.909 --> 00:47:27.811
WITH MEANINGFUL ARTIFACTS TO

00:47:27.878 --> 00:47:29.680
JUST CLASSROOM PRACTICE. NO

00:47:29.746 --> 00:47:30.814
MORE RECENTLY AS IT'S BEEN

00:47:30.881 --> 00:47:32.549
REFERENCE THE S. BACKED INTERIM

00:47:32.616 --> 00:47:36.286
ASSESSMENTS HAVE EXPANDED TO

00:47:36.353 --> 00:47:37.187
ALLOW TEACHERS MORE FOR.

00:47:37.254 --> 00:47:38.789
ASSESSMENTS AND ALLOW TEACHERS

00:47:38.855 --> 00:47:41.024
WHICH IS IMPORTANT TO YOU ITEM

00:47:41.091 --> 00:47:42.960
ANALYSIS BY STUDENT NAME. WHILE

00:47:43.026 --> 00:47:43.760
THE ASPECT INTERMENT

00:47:43.827 --> 00:47:45.762
ASSESSMENTS ARE INTENDED TO

00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:46.863
LEAD TO IMPROVE TEACHER

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:48.732
COLLECTED ADVOCACY. ELEAZAR ARE

00:47:48.799 --> 00:47:50.534
STRUGGLING TO EFFECTIVELY

00:47:50.601 --> 00:47:51.535
IMPLEMENT THE ENORMOUS

00:47:51.602 --> 00:47:53.503
ESTIMATES DO THE FACT THAT THE

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:57.908
ASSESSMENTS AND TOOLS ON THEIR

00:47:57.975 --> 00:48:01.278
OWN ARE NOT INTUITIVE. TO HELLO.

00:48:01.345 --> 00:48:02.980
ACCESS THE ONLINE SO. VIEW

00:48:03.046 --> 00:48:04.615
STUDENTS RESULTS AND LEARNING

00:48:04.681 --> 00:48:07.084
HOW TO ANALYZE OUTCOMES USING

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:09.119
THE ONLINE PORTABLES. WITH

00:48:09.186 --> 00:48:10.587
THESE BARRIERS THESE ARE THESE

00:48:10.654 --> 00:48:12.256
BERRIES ARE NOT INSURMOUNTABLE

00:48:12.322 --> 00:48:13.657
BUT THE REQUIRED DEDICATED

00:48:13.724 --> 00:48:16.226
STAFF PAID STAFF TO MANAGE THE

00:48:16.293 --> 00:48:18.061
ONLINE REPORTING SYSTEM IN

00:48:18.128 --> 00:48:19.963
ORDER TO GENERATE REPORTS AND

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:20.831
REQUIRE THE TEACHERS ARE

00:48:20.897 --> 00:48:22.799
PROVIDED WITH TIME TO ANALYZE

00:48:22.866 --> 00:48:24.935
AND DISCUSS THE RESULTS. NOW

00:48:25.002 --> 00:48:25.902
BEFORE I CAME I MAY TRY

00:48:25.969 --> 00:48:27.271
SURVEYED OUR OUR TEACHERS AND

00:48:27.337 --> 00:48:28.505
THEY PROVIDED ANECDOTAL

00:48:28.572 --> 00:48:30.707
INFORMATION BOX ME THEY REALLY

00:48:30.774 --> 00:48:31.975
DO WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING

00:48:32.042 --> 00:48:33.310
AND AS EFERENCED EARLIER THE

00:48:33.377 --> 00:48:34.711
CALIFORNIA JOSH FOR THE HIGH

00:48:34.778 --> 00:48:36.680
SCHOOL SECOND- LEVEL. USES

00:48:36.747 --> 00:48:38.148
THAT'S BACK RESULTS IN THREE

00:48:38.215 --> 00:48:39.249
PLACES ENGLISH MATH AND ON THE

00:48:39.316 --> 00:48:41.251
CCI INDICATOR THEY REALLY

00:48:41.318 --> 00:48:42.452
WANTED TO THE RIGHT THING AND

00:48:42.519 --> 00:48:44.021
THEY'RE FEELING THAT THE PORTAL

00:48:44.087 --> 00:48:46.056
ITSELF THE ABILITY TO ACCESS

00:48:46.123 --> 00:48:47.691
AND GET REAL TIME. INFORMATION

00:48:47.758 --> 00:48:50.160
IS A CHALLENGE SO IF THE

00:48:50.227 --> 00:48:51.028
INTERIM ASSESSMENT DATA IS NOT

00:48:51.094 --> 00:48:53.063
TIMELY ACTIONABLE AND

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:54.665
INFORMATIVE TO TEACHERS THERE

00:48:54.731 --> 00:48:56.300
WILL BE VERY LITTLE CHANGE IN

00:48:56.366 --> 00:48:58.769
CLASS FROM PRACTICES. TEACHERS

00:48:58.835 --> 00:49:00.237
NEED ACTIONABLE DATA THAT

00:49:00.304 --> 00:49:01.838
ALLOWS HIM TO BETTER ANSWER

00:49:01.905 --> 00:49:05.642
THESE QUESTIONS. DID THE

00:49:05.709 --> 00:49:06.143
STUDENTS GAIN ESSENTIAL

00:49:06.209 --> 00:49:07.778
UNDERSTANDING SKILLS HOW DO WE

00:49:07.844 --> 00:49:10.514
KNOW HOWCAN WE USE EVIDENCE OF

00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:13.550
STUDENT LEARNING TO IMPROVE

00:49:13.617 --> 00:49:14.151
CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION. PRINCE

00:49:14.217 --> 00:49:15.485
AND OTHER SCHOOL INSTRUCTIONAL

00:49:15.552 --> 00:49:17.054
MUST ALSO RECEIVED TRAINING ON

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:18.555
PROFESSIONAL DEL DEVELOPMENT ON

00:49:18.622 --> 00:49:20.190
THE COLLECTIVE ELLAGIC EFFICACY

00:49:20.257 --> 00:49:22.225
POTENTIAL. OF THE ENORMOUS

00:49:22.292 --> 00:49:24.695
ESTIMATES TO DATE MANY ALWAYS

00:49:24.761 --> 00:49:26.797
INCLUDING MY OWN. HAVE

00:49:26.863 --> 00:49:28.665
STRUGGLED TO PROVIDE SUCH TIME

00:49:28.732 --> 00:49:30.367
THE ACTUAL FEEDBACK USING THE

00:49:30.434 --> 00:49:31.902
INTERIM ASSESSMENTS. THEREFORE

00:49:31.968 --> 00:49:33.370
THE TOOLS PROVIDED BY THE STATE

00:49:33.437 --> 00:49:37.708
pGOAL FOR OUTCOME. THE THEME OF

00:49:37.774 --> 00:49:39.042
TODAY'S HEARING THIS CONTINUOUS

00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:40.644
IMPROVEMENT THEREFORE THE

00:49:40.711 --> 00:49:42.479
QUESTION IS HOW CAN WE AS A

00:49:42.546 --> 00:49:43.547
CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EDUCATIONAL

00:49:43.613 --> 00:49:45.515
SYSTEM. IMPLEMENTED ASSESSMENT

00:49:45.582 --> 00:49:48.251
MODEL THAT IS VALUED AND

00:49:48.318 --> 00:49:50.287
EMBRACED BY TEACHERS BECAUSE IT

00:49:50.354 --> 00:49:52.422
PROVIDES TEACHERS WITH DATA

00:49:52.489 --> 00:49:54.124
THAT LINK STUDENT LEARNING TO

00:49:54.191 --> 00:49:55.992
THE EXPECTED CLASSROOM LEARNING

00:49:56.059 --> 00:49:58.428
EXPECTATIONS. SOME OF THOSE

00:49:58.495 --> 00:49:59.896
SUCH AS I PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED

00:49:59.963 --> 00:50:01.732
ESTABLISH THE BAR FOR LEARNING

00:50:01.798 --> 00:50:03.600
FOR BY GRADE LEVEL BUT SUMMIT

00:50:03.667 --> 00:50:06.069
ASSESSMENTS DO NOT EXPLAIN HOW

00:50:06.136 --> 00:50:08.338
EVERY STUDENT IS EXPECTED TO

00:50:08.405 --> 00:50:10.540
CLEAR THE BAR. ASSUMING WE ALL

00:50:10.607 --> 00:50:12.109
AGREE. THAT ASKED THAT THE

00:50:12.175 --> 00:50:14.177
ASPECT ASSESSMENTS MEASURE WHAT

00:50:14.244 --> 00:50:15.779
WE WANT THE STUDENTS TO BE ABLE

00:50:15.846 --> 00:50:17.614
TO KNOWING DO FOR ENGLISH

00:50:17.681 --> 00:50:19.649
LANGUAGE ARTS AND MATHEMATICS.

00:50:19.716 --> 00:50:20.584
I FEEL WE NEED TO SHIFT THE

00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:22.419
CONVERSATION TO HOW TEACHERS

00:50:22.486 --> 00:50:23.987
COLLECTIVELY IMPACTS STUDENT

00:50:24.054 --> 00:50:26.590
LEARNING TO MEET THE AGREED

00:50:26.656 --> 00:50:27.724
UPON LEARNING TARGETS. AS

00:50:27.791 --> 00:50:31.528
STATES TO UNDERSTAND COLLECTIVE

00:50:31.595 --> 00:50:34.131
IMPACT TEAMS OF TEACHERS NEED

00:50:34.197 --> 00:50:36.032
DETERMINE IF USING CLASSROOMS.

00:50:36.099 --> 00:50:37.934
POSITIVELY IN STOOD OUTCOMES.

00:50:38.001 --> 00:50:40.103
EXAMINING SPECIFIC EVIDENCE OF

00:50:40.170 --> 00:50:42.239
STUDENT LEARNING. OUR

00:50:42.305 --> 00:50:43.340
ASSESSMENT SYSTEM SHOULD MATTER

00:50:43.407 --> 00:50:46.510
MATTER WHAT WE WANT STUDENTS TO

00:50:46.576 --> 00:50:48.078
BE ABLE TO GO INTO AND PROVIDE

00:50:48.145 --> 00:50:52.082
AN ANSWER RUNNING SO TEACHERS

00:50:52.149 --> 00:50:53.216
REFLECT THEIR TALK. TO IMPA

00:50:53.283 --> 00:50:54.584
STUDENT LEARNING. I LOOK FOR A

00:50:54.651 --> 00:50:56.820
DANCE YOUR RECKON PROVIDE GREAT

00:50:56.887 --> 00:50:58.088
SERVICE CITY AND CONCRETE

00:50:58.155 --> 00:51:01.858
EXAMPLES GREAT THE IT WAS CSUS.

00:51:01.925 --> 00:51:05.896
BUT HONESTLY I THINK YOU MISTER

00:51:05.962 --> 00:51:07.130
EITHER MISTER LAW ACTUALLY THE

00:51:07.197 --> 00:51:08.298
SAME THING HE JUST SAID IT IN

00:51:08.365 --> 00:51:10.767
DIFFERENT WAYS I REALLY DO

00:51:10.834 --> 00:51:11.768
BELIEVE THAT THE YOU USED

00:51:11.835 --> 00:51:12.969
TEACHER SPEAK YEARS

00:51:13.036 --> 00:51:17.140
ADMINISTRATIVE SPEAK- BUT- I

00:51:17.207 --> 00:51:18.809
MEAN THAT THAT'S WHAT I HEARD

00:51:18.875 --> 00:51:19.709
ACTUALLY I THINK YOU GOT IT.

00:51:19.776 --> 00:51:21.044
ALLUDED TO WHAT I'M ALLUDING TO

00:51:21.111 --> 00:51:22.913
WE NEED MORE FEEDBACK ON A MORE

00:51:22.979 --> 00:51:24.314
IMMEDIATE BASIS THROUGHOUT THE

00:51:24.381 --> 00:51:26.216
YEAR NOT JUST AT THE END OF THE

00:51:26.283 --> 00:51:26.783
YEAR THAT SUMMIT TO PREVENT

00:51:26.850 --> 00:51:29.219
AGAIN- AND HOW DO WE DO THAT.

00:51:29.286 --> 00:51:30.754
RIGHT I THINK THAT'S A REAL

00:51:30.821 --> 00:51:32.556
NEXT QUESTION FOR THE S. BACK

00:51:32.622 --> 00:51:34.424
ASSESSMENT SYSTEM OR- BECAUSE I

00:51:34.491 --> 00:51:35.892
WANT TO BE AN ASSESSMENT SYSTEM

00:51:35.959 --> 00:51:37.928
NOT A TESTING SYSTEM. AS WE AS

00:51:37.994 --> 00:51:40.096
WE MENTION. BUT I THINK IT IS

00:51:40.163 --> 00:51:41.465
THE HIGHLIGHT HERE THAT IN

00:51:41.531 --> 00:51:43.133
TERMS ARE NOT FORMATIVE. IN

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:45.101
TERM AS A CHUNK OF TIME. A

00:51:45.168 --> 00:51:46.603
FORMATIVE CAN BE ON A SPECIFIC

00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:48.505
STANDARD. THE MEASURE OF THE

00:51:48.572 --> 00:51:49.272
COMMITTEE KNOWS WHAT I'M

00:51:49.339 --> 00:51:50.140
TALKING ABOUT THE RIGHT NOW BUT

00:51:50.207 --> 00:51:52.309
I HOPE THEY DO- BUT A BIT AGAIN

00:51:52.375 --> 00:51:53.710
FORMERS IS MORE IMMEDIATE IT'S

00:51:53.777 --> 00:51:55.345
MORE IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK. IT

00:51:55.412 --> 00:51:57.047
COULD BE ON A DAILY BASIS COULD

00:51:57.113 --> 00:51:58.281
BE I MET A TEN MINUTE BASIS

00:51:58.348 --> 00:52:00.383
RIGHT. ARE THEY ARE ARE THEY

00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:03.186
ARE THE MASTERING. THE MATERIAL

00:52:03.253 --> 00:52:04.254
AND THEN YOU TALKED ABOUT

00:52:04.321 --> 00:52:05.522
ANALYZING THE DATA THAT'S

00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:06.289
BECOME VERY DIFFICULT TO HEAR

00:52:06.356 --> 00:52:07.991
THIS YOU HAVE TO GO TO FOUR

00:52:08.058 --> 00:52:09.993
SITES APPARENTLY. IT WE NEED TO

00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:10.894
FIX THAT. HERE'S DON'T HAVE

00:52:10.961 --> 00:52:12.696
TIME TO GO TO FOUR SIDES. YOU

00:52:12.762 --> 00:52:13.964
KNOW WHAT FIVE CLASSES IN HIGH

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:15.632
SCHOOL MAYBE MAYBE SIX CLASSES

00:52:15.699 --> 00:52:16.800
THAT'S- CLOSE TO TWO HUNDRED

00:52:16.867 --> 00:52:18.969
STUDENTS. HEY UNIFOR WEBSITES

00:52:19.035 --> 00:52:21.338
FOR STUDENTS. RIGHT NOT

00:52:21.404 --> 00:52:22.672
PRACTICAL. SO WE NEED TO FIX

00:52:22.739 --> 00:52:25.041
THAT- AND MAYBE IF SOMEONE FROM

00:52:25.108 --> 00:52:26.276
THE S. BACK COULD COME UP AT

00:52:26.343 --> 00:52:26.877
ADDRESS THAT IN A MINUTE AND A

00:52:26.943 --> 00:52:29.412
MINUTE- BUT AGAIN IT WHAT WHAT.

00:52:29.479 --> 00:52:30.714
WHAT I'VE ALSO SEEN A LAST TIME

00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:31.748
WE HAD THIS YEAR'S COUPLE YEARS

00:52:31.815 --> 00:52:34.417
AGO ACTUALLY OF NONPROFITS AND

00:52:34.484 --> 00:52:35.018
ACTUALLY FOR PROFIT COMPANIES

00:52:35.085 --> 00:52:36.052
COME UP. R THEY'VE ACTUALLY

00:52:36.119 --> 00:52:38.188
CREE. A DEVICE OUTSIDE OF THE

00:52:38.255 --> 00:52:40.290
US BACK. THAT IS MORE INTERIM

00:52:40.357 --> 00:52:41.424
OR MORE MORE FORMATIVE IN

00:52:41.491 --> 00:52:43.360
NATURE. AND THAT THAT SOME

00:52:43.426 --> 00:52:44.528
DISTRICTS WERE BUYING THAT WILL

00:52:44.594 --> 00:52:46.496
THEY HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER

00:52:46.563 --> 00:52:47.964
PRODUCT TO FIGURE OUT. HOW THEY

00:52:48.031 --> 00:52:49.733
BEST MEET THE NEEDS. ARE THERE

00:52:49.799 --> 00:52:51.067
ARE THE DEMANDS OF THE ASPECTS

00:52:51.134 --> 00:52:52.435
SYSTEM SO THAT SHOULD ALL BE

00:52:52.502 --> 00:52:54.237
BUILT INTO THE ASPECT THAT

00:52:54.304 --> 00:52:54.871
WHOLE SYSTEM SHOULD BE BUILT ON

00:52:54.938 --> 00:52:56.806
THE S. BACK. AND THAT'S A

00:52:56.873 --> 00:52:57.407
FAILURE A LITTLE BIT FROM YOU

00:52:57.474 --> 00:52:58.708
KNOW FROM SACRAMENTO. MAJOR

00:52:58.775 --> 00:53:01.077
DISCONNECT- FROM THIS DíAS AND

00:53:01.144 --> 00:53:02.712
CLASSROOM THAT'S WHY I'M GLAD

00:53:02.779 --> 00:53:04.581
YOU'RE GIVING US. THAT FEEDBACK

00:53:04.648 --> 00:53:08.552
AND I'VE- THE BILL OF THE PAST

00:53:08.618 --> 00:53:09.152
MCCARTY PUSH THIS YEAR WHAT.

00:53:09.219 --> 00:53:09.619
THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL

00:53:09.686 --> 00:53:11.054
SPECIFICALLY AND IT WAS.

00:53:11.121 --> 00:53:12.489
CONTROVERSIAL AND THAT WAS TO

00:53:12.556 --> 00:53:15.892
ALLOW THE ACT OR SAT. TO

00:53:15.959 --> 00:53:17.360
REPLACE THE US BACK AND THAT'LL

00:53:17.427 --> 00:53:19.095
EMIGRATE YOUR BUT WHY MY MAJOR

00:58:55.064 --> 00:58:55.899
MEASURE THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL

00:58:55.965 --> 00:58:56.966
NUMBER OF A SET IN ASSESSMENTS

00:58:57.033 --> 00:58:58.968
THAT AVAILABLE FOR MATHEMATICS

00:58:59.035 --> 00:59:00.303
AND IT'S HARD TO SEE BUT-

00:59:00.370 --> 00:59:01.271
THERE'S A HUNDRED EIGHTY SCHOOL

00:59:01.337 --> 00:59:02.739
DAYS IN A GIVEN YEAR. SO THEY

00:59:02.805 --> 00:59:05.441
ALSO BECOMES QUESTION FROM THE

00:59:05.508 --> 00:59:05.909
GO SUPPORT PEDAGOGICAL

00:59:05.975 --> 00:59:07.777
PERSPECTIVE. HOW MANY DAYS OF

00:59:07.844 --> 00:59:09.112
THE HUNDRED EIGHTY THAT WE-WE

00:59:09.178 --> 00:59:10.947
GONNA COMMIT. TO PROCTOR IN

00:59:11.014 --> 00:59:13.683
THESE. THESE EXACT. INSTEAD OF

00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:16.753
GETTING OFF SUBJECT INSTEAD OF

00:59:16.819 --> 00:59:17.987
ALLOWING THE TEACHERS. TO TEACH

00:59:18.054 --> 00:59:20.924
THE- OKAY BORDER. TOWN THE IT I

00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:23.192
DON'T. THINK WHAT WHAT IS IT

00:59:23.259 --> 00:59:24.294
THAT WE ARE. DURING WHAT IS

00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:26.930
WHICH TO CALL WHAT IS THE WE

00:59:26.996 --> 00:59:28.598
WANT STUDENTS TO WHAT. AND WE

00:59:28.665 --> 00:59:35.438
GOT TO. AND THEN. AND IF I CAN.

00:59:35.505 --> 00:59:37.907
HAVE THE- IT IS SUBSTANTIAL AND

00:59:37.974 --> 00:59:38.942
AN EX IT ALTHOUGH IS A GOOD

00:59:39.008 --> 00:59:40.443
THING IT ALLOWS TEACHERS RIGHT

00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:41.244
SPECIFIC THINGS WANT TO LOOK AT

00:59:41.311 --> 00:59:41.878
BUT IT BUT IT THERE A LOT HERE

00:59:41.945 --> 00:59:45.348
SO AND- MISS HOMES. WELL THAT

00:59:45.415 --> 00:59:48.985
REALLY. AND ABSOLUTELY I MEAN

00:59:49.052 --> 00:59:51.321
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO USE THE

00:59:51.387 --> 00:59:51.854
INFORMATION TO ACCESS THE

00:59:51.921 --> 00:59:53.089
INFORMATION TO MAKE IT USER

00:59:53.156 --> 00:59:55.224
FRIENDLY FOR TEACHERS TO MAKE

00:59:55.291 --> 00:59:56.225
SENSE OF IT AND THIS IS THE

00:59:56.292 --> 00:59:59.028
INTERIM YES. UNDER RIGHT AND IN

00:59:59.095 --> 01:00:01.531
YOU POINTED OUT IN TERM DOESN'T

01:00:01.597 --> 01:00:02.198
NECESSARILY MEAN FORMATIVE A

01:00:02.265 --> 01:00:03.633
FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT SHOULD

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:05.568
INFORM IT'S IN THE ROOT OF THE

01:00:05.635 --> 01:00:06.569
WORD IT SHOULD INFORM

01:00:06.636 --> 01:00:08.204
INSTRUCTION AND IT'S JUST NOT

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:09.372
DOING THAT AT THIS POINT LEAST

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:10.740
THAT'S THE FEEDBACK THAT WE'RE

01:00:10.807 --> 01:00:12.976
GETTING IN OUR DISTRICT AND

01:00:13.042 --> 01:00:15.611
FROM DIFFERENT SITES DIFFERENT

01:00:15.678 --> 01:00:18.448
TACK GRADE LEVELS THAT WHAT IS

01:00:18.514 --> 01:00:20.216
BECOMING MORE PRONOUNCED IS

01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:21.851
THAT WHEN YOU FINALLY GET TO

01:00:21.918 --> 01:00:23.252
OKAY THIS MANY KIDS MISS THIS

01:00:23.319 --> 01:00:24.554
QUESTION WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE

01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:26.189
QUESTION OR IS TO THE CHILDREN

01:00:26.255 --> 01:00:27.623
TRULY UNDERSTAND THE CONTENT OR

01:00:27.690 --> 01:00:29.025
DO THEY UNDER. NOT UNDERSTAND

01:00:29.092 --> 01:00:30.860
THE WAY THE QUESTION WAS ASKED

01:00:30.927 --> 01:00:33.563
AND THAT'S A DIFFERENT QUESTION

01:00:33.629 --> 01:00:35.598
I MEAN WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON

01:00:35.665 --> 01:00:37.133
MAKING SURE CHILDREN UNDERSTAND

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.935
THE STANDARDS WE SHOULD MAKE BE

01:00:39.002 --> 01:00:40.770
MAKING SURE THAT- OUR TEACHERS

01:00:40.837 --> 01:00:42.839
ARE EMPOWERED WITH HIGH QUALITY

01:00:42.905 --> 01:00:44.807
INSTRUCTION TO ENSURE THAT THEY

01:00:44.874 --> 01:00:46.509
MEET THE STANDARDS WE SHOULD BE

01:00:46.576 --> 01:00:47.343
LOOKING AT THE STANDARDS IS A

01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:50.913
FLOOR NOT THIS THE CEILING. AND

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:52.215
INSTEAD FOCUS NOW IS GOING TO

01:00:52.281 --> 01:00:54.150
THE LÏNG THE TASK IS HOW YOU

01:00:54.217 --> 01:00:58.121
TO MAKE SURE A PASS THIS

01:00:58.187 --> 01:00:59.288
QUESTION TO. AND I THINK

01:00:59.355 --> 01:01:00.590
SOMETHING THAT. WE'RE MISSING

01:01:00.656 --> 01:01:03.726
THE POINT THERE. OKAY SO SUIT

01:01:03.793 --> 01:01:05.361
HELL HELPS LEAD QUESTION HOW

01:01:05.428 --> 01:01:07.430
LONG HOW MANY DAYS A YEAR DOES

01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:08.031
IT TAKE YOU TO ADMINISTER THE

01:01:08.097 --> 01:01:12.001
TEST. WILD THAT. WE CAN IN. TWO

01:01:12.068 --> 01:01:13.703
WEEKS WE SPENT TWO WEEKS AMEND

01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:15.505
DAYS TEN SCHOOL THAT. OF THE

01:01:15.571 --> 01:01:17.540
YEAR YEAH TEN DAYS AT THE END

01:01:17.607 --> 01:01:18.341
OF THE YEAR AND THAT'S THE

01:01:18.408 --> 01:01:20.743
OTHER THING TO IMAGINE PERCENT

01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:23.112
OF YOUR YEAR WELL AND ON TOP OF

01:01:23.179 --> 01:01:23.813

YOU KNOW IF IN TERMS TO THEN

01:01:25.815 --> 01:01:27.784
ADD THAT ON THAT SPENDING A

01:01:27.850 --> 01:01:28.684
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF YOUR

01:01:28.751 --> 01:01:30.620
TESTING ON TOP OF DISTRICTS

01:01:30.686 --> 01:01:31.587
THAT THEIR OWN ASSESSMENTS

01:01:31.654 --> 01:01:33.689
HEATED TO WHICH IS A PROBLEM

01:01:33.756 --> 01:01:36.325
THAT I KNOW THAT'S OUTSIDE OF

01:01:36.392 --> 01:01:36.926
THE REALM. I'VE GOT A LOADED

01:01:36.993 --> 01:01:37.927
QUESTION FOR YOU. ARE YOU'RE

01:01:37.994 --> 01:01:39.996

YES MA'AM. WHAT YOU'VE DONE AND

01:01:53.676 --> 01:01:55.445
IN IT INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR

01:01:55.511 --> 01:01:56.979
SOME PRODUCT THROUGH US BACK IF

01:01:57.046 --> 01:01:58.381
HE'S CREATED YOUR OWN FORMATIVE

01:01:58.448 --> 01:01:59.782
ASSESSMENT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT

01:01:59.849 --> 01:02:00.550
WE DID PROBLEM I HAVE WITH A

01:02:00.616 --> 01:02:01.818
CHALLENGE I HAVE WITH AS THAT

01:02:01.884 --> 01:02:03.820
MEANS THERE'S ONE THOUSAND

01:02:03.886 --> 01:02:06.255
pACCOUNTING DIFFERENCE AFTER

01:02:06.322 --> 01:02:07.890
SPENDING TIME CREATING THEIR

01:02:07.957 --> 01:02:09.926
OWN ASSESSMENTS NOTHING WE

01:02:09.992 --> 01:02:11.561
SPENT ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS

01:02:11.627 --> 01:02:12.728
ON THAT ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO.

01:02:12.795 --> 01:02:13.429
DOING THAT I THINK THEY WERE

01:02:13.496 --> 01:02:15.498
GOING PLAN BECAUSE THE S. AND

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:17.700
FULLY DEVELOPED HAD GONE ONLINE

01:02:17.767 --> 01:02:19.502
AND USE IT WE'RE GETTING READY

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:22.538
FOR IT I WAS ONE OF THEM. RIGHT

01:02:22.605 --> 01:02:23.673
ALL THEY THAT WHEN TEACHERS

01:02:23.739 --> 01:02:25.174
CREATE ON ASSESSMENTS THE LEVEL

01:02:25.241 --> 01:02:26.843
OF LEARNING FOR TEACHERS GOES

01:02:26.909 --> 01:02:29.011
WAY WAY UP. RIGHT NOW. THEY

01:02:29.078 --> 01:02:30.947
HAVE TO DECIDE HOW MUCH FAITH.

01:02:31.013 --> 01:02:32.315
THEY'RE PUTTING IN ON AS BACK

01:02:32.381 --> 01:02:33.883
AND THE ITEMS THE TEST ITEMS IN

01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:35.785
THIS BACK. WHEN TEACHERS

01:02:35.852 --> 01:02:37.386
KNOWLEDGE IS NOT THAT HIGH

01:02:37.453 --> 01:02:38.321
THEY'RE GOING TO THEY'RE GOING

01:02:38.387 --> 01:02:39.722
TO DO IT MOST TEACHERS DO THEY

01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:41.524
TEACH TO THE TEST THEY- AND SO.

01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:42.992
WHAT WE BEHOLDING TO WE'RE

01:02:43.059 --> 01:02:44.894
BEHOLDING TO THE TEST FOR SURE

01:02:44.961 --> 01:02:46.462
BUT WE'RE ALSO HOLDING TO OUR

KIDS IN THE NEXT GRADE LEVEL

01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:48.798
RUSSELL BEHOLDING TO THOSE KIDS

01:02:48.865 --> 01:02:49.799
WHEN THEY GET TO MIDDLE SCHOOL.

01:02:49.866 --> 01:02:51.167
WERE ALSO THE WHOLE TO GET

01:02:51.234 --> 01:02:52.068

THROUGH A MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY.

01:02:58.541 --> 01:03:00.710
SO WHEN TEACHER KNOWLEDGE COMES

01:03:00.776 --> 01:03:01.811
UP WHEN THEY'RE CREATING

01:03:01.878 --> 01:03:02.979

QUITE A BIT OF THINKING ABOUT

01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:35.678
THE SUBJECT ITSELF- I PROBABLY

01:03:35.745 --> 01:03:36.879
I THINK I WAS PROBABLY THE ONLY

01:03:36.946 --> 01:03:39.015
ONE ON THE IN THE ASSEMBLY WHEN

THIS SO SMART BALANCE AND- WE

01:03:43.186 --> 01:03:45.321
PUT IN TWO BILLION DOLLARS SO I

01:03:45.388 --> 01:03:47.156
REMEMBER- AT THE- EDUCATION

WONDERING THAT WE WAIT A TWO

01:03:52.361 --> 01:03:53.896
BILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE THE

01:03:53.963 --> 01:03:55.765
QUESTIONS THAT I'M HEARING IN

MOVED VERY FAR- WE SEEM TO BE

01:03:59.702 --> 01:04:02.138
SAYING BUT WE WERE OF WHAT IS

01:04:02.205 --> 01:04:05.241
WAS IN TWENTY THIRTEEN- WHEN WE

01:04:05.308 --> 01:04:07.476
PUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS HE SAID

01:04:07.543 --> 01:04:09.845
IF IT FILE THE SMART OF BALANCE

01:04:09.912 --> 01:04:13.249
OR IS. COMMON CORE WAS TO BE A-

01:04:13.316 --> 01:04:14.917
IT'S GOING TO BE. SOME OUT OF

01:04:14.984 --> 01:04:16.552
THE AFTER LIMITED TRAINING.

01:04:16.619 --> 01:04:17.386
REMEMBER THE AND WE GAVE TO

01:04:17.453 --> 01:04:18.020
BILLION INTO THE BUDGET THE-

01:04:18.087 --> 01:04:19.422
YEAR CARING WHAT THIS. YEAR WE

01:04:19.488 --> 01:04:20.423
PUT IN BUT WE PUT A LOT OF

01:04:20.489 --> 01:04:22.491
MONEY. INTO OF STAFF

01:04:22.558 --> 01:04:24.026
DEVELOPMENT TRAINING THOSE

01:04:24.093 --> 01:04:26.596
KINDS OF THINGS- WE'VE BEEN

01:04:26.662 --> 01:04:28.464
MENTIONED THE NEED FOR THE-

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:30.600
UNIVERSITIES TO- CHANGE THEIR

01:04:30.666 --> 01:04:32.068
TEACHER TRAINING. EDUCATION

01:04:32.134 --> 01:04:33.135
PROGRAM SO THAT WE WOULDN'T FOR

01:04:33.202 --> 01:04:35.705
BE FOREVER. IN THIS MODE THE

01:04:35.771 --> 01:04:37.173
WE'RE IN NOW TRYING TO FIGURE

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:38.708
OUT HOW TO GET THERE HOW TO.

01:04:38.774 --> 01:04:40.543
HELP KIDS TO SUCCEED. AND

01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:41.644
WHETHER NOT ARE MET THAT AND

01:04:41.711 --> 01:04:42.912
ARE THINGS THAT WE'RE USING TO

01:04:42.979 --> 01:04:44.447
ACCOMPLISH THE GOALS THAT WITH

01:04:44.513 --> 01:04:45.848
THE EYES YOU MENTION WE SET THE

01:04:45.915 --> 01:04:47.350
STATE ANOTHER QUESTION IS HOW

01:04:47.416 --> 01:04:48.084
DO WE GET THE KIDS TO THE

01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:50.052
STANDARD. AND WHICH BECOMES THE

01:04:50.119 --> 01:04:51.487
REAL CHALLENGE WHICH IS REALLY

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:53.522
THE TEACHING THAT OCCURS MUCH

01:04:53.589 --> 01:04:55.258
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. AND

01:04:55.324 --> 01:04:57.226
THAT HAS BECOME OBVIOUS THE

01:04:57.293 --> 01:04:58.661
SHOP AND I'M- I'M I'M I'M HAPPY

01:04:58.728 --> 01:05:00.896

THAT'S A REAL CHALLENGE IS

01:05:02.398 --> 01:05:06.068
REALLY NOT SO MUCH. A DEFINED

01:05:06.135 --> 01:05:09.705
UNDER ITS AND WHAT HAVE WE DONE

01:05:09.772 --> 01:05:11.707

THINGS. HOW GET KIDS THERE AND

01:05:15.678 --> 01:05:21.150
ONE OF THE. WE NEED TO. THE

01:05:21.217 --> 01:05:21.717
STAFF THE ELEMENTARY FOR TO

01:05:21.784 --> 01:05:22.351
HELP THEM GET THE BECAUSE THEY

01:05:22.418 --> 01:05:23.853
IS A NEW WAY OF IS AN METHOD

01:05:23.919 --> 01:05:25.121
THIS A NEW THAT WOULD LOOK FOR

01:05:25.187 --> 01:05:25.855
AND OF WHAT WEEKS FROM I

01:05:25.921 --> 01:05:27.757
PEOPLE'S A PART OF THAT WAS

01:05:27.823 --> 01:05:28.491
SUPPOSED TO BE STAFF

01:05:28.557 --> 01:05:30.826
DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING SO I'M

01:05:30.893 --> 01:05:32.094
NOT SURE IF WE'VE DONE ENOUGH

01:05:32.161 --> 01:05:34.063
OF THAT- I'M NOT SURE WHERE OUR

01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:36.098
UNIVERSITIES ARE BECAUSE YOU

01:05:36.165 --> 01:05:37.566
KNOW THE GENERAL THINKING IS

01:05:37.633 --> 01:05:38.768
THAT THEY'RE THE ONES TRAINING

01:05:38.834 --> 01:05:40.002
OUR TEACHERS EIGHTY SOME

01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:41.137
PERCENT OF ALL OF OUR TEACHERS

01:05:41.203 --> 01:05:42.238
COME FROM THE C. ISSUE SYSTEM.

01:05:42.305 --> 01:05:43.506
SO WHETHER NOT ART TEACHER IT

01:05:43.572 --> 01:05:45.574
PROGRAMS HAVE ADAPTED TO IT I'M

01:05:45.641 --> 01:05:47.643
NOT REALLY SURE OF I KNOW WHEN

01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:49.078
I WAS AT THE UNIVERSITY I DON'T

01:05:49.145 --> 01:05:50.646
I DON'T SEE THE UNIVERSE IS

01:05:50.713 --> 01:05:52.415
RESPONDING A LOT TO OUR STUFF

01:05:52.481 --> 01:05:54.283
ME THEY DO IN TERMS OF WHAT

01:05:54.350 --> 01:05:57.186
THEY RIGHT NOT NECESSARILY IN

01:05:57.253 --> 01:05:58.487
HOW THEY HANDLED THIS TO

01:05:58.554 --> 01:06:01.223
TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT SEEM TO

01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:02.758
BE THAT. BEN FOR LAST EIGHTEEN

01:06:02.825 --> 01:06:04.627
YEARS SO THIS A REAL CHANCE AT

01:06:04.694 --> 01:06:07.496
MY OTHER FIRST RATE COMES IN

01:06:07.563 --> 01:06:08.397
THE FACT THAT. WE'VE DONE A

01:06:08.464 --> 01:06:09.732
LITTLE TO LOOK AT THE SYSTEM

01:06:09.799 --> 01:06:10.833
AND EXIST BECAUSE MOST OF OUR

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:12.535
CHALLENGES K. TWELVE. I MEAN

01:06:12.601 --> 01:06:14.303
CASE SIX K. SEVEN. BECAUSE IF

01:06:14.370 --> 01:06:15.805
YOU GET A- FUNCTIONING AND

01:06:15.871 --> 01:06:17.606
DOING WHAT YOU WANT IN THE

01:06:17.673 --> 01:06:19.642
FIRST FIVE OR SIX YEARS. IS TO

01:06:19.709 --> 01:06:20.743
HELP YOU KNOW I'S A SLIDE DOWN

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:22.878
HILL PRETTY MUCH BECAUSE- AT

01:06:22.945 --> 01:06:23.646
THAT POINT IS REALLY JUST A

01:06:23.713 --> 01:06:25.214
SIMPLE YOU. BASICALLY

01:06:25.281 --> 01:06:26.615
OVERLAYING THIS CONTENT OVER

01:06:26.682 --> 01:06:27.650
THE SKILLS THAT THE KIDS HAVE

01:06:27.717 --> 01:06:29.285
DEVELOPED IN TERMS OF. HOW THEY

01:06:29.352 --> 01:06:30.786
THINK AND WHAT THEY SEE. SO I

01:06:30.853 --> 01:06:32.988
BIG FAILURE LIES IN K. FIVE.

01:06:33.055 --> 01:06:34.156
YEAH AND THEN IT JUST

01:06:34.223 --> 01:06:35.591
MULTIPLIES AFTER THAT IF YOU

01:06:35.658 --> 01:06:37.526
DON'T GET IT DONE. SO I'M NOT

01:06:37.593 --> 01:06:38.928
SURE WHETHER WHAT WHAT WE'VE

01:06:38.994 --> 01:06:41.564
DONE IN TERMS OF. ENSURING THAT

01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:43.366
THAT FIRST FIVE OR SIX YEARS

01:06:43.432 --> 01:06:44.367
MAKES A DIFFERENCE AND IT

01:06:44.433 --> 01:06:45.968
SHOULD BE MAKING A DIFFERENCE

01:06:46.035 --> 01:06:47.703
IN TERMS OF WHAT WE SEE WHAT WE

01:06:47.770 --> 01:06:49.038
WANT. AND WHAT THE NOT DONE THE

01:06:49.105 --> 01:06:50.706
NECESSARY STAFF DEVELOPMENT.

01:06:50.773 --> 01:06:52.074
TRAINING BUT IT IS. IT IS

01:06:52.141 --> 01:06:53.476
IMPORTANT WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT

01:06:53.542 --> 01:06:55.778
WE CAN WE CAN DEVELOP WE CAN.

01:06:55.845 --> 01:06:57.913
ADAPT ALL THE STUFF THAT WE GET

01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:59.548
WE CAN CHANGE THIS THAT AND THE

01:06:59.615 --> 01:07:00.950
OTHER. BUT IF WE DON'T. YOU OUT

01:07:01.016 --> 01:07:03.319
KEY THE TERM. ON THE- KING AT

01:07:03.386 --> 01:07:06.122
KIDS WHOSE. WHO WOULD 2020%

01:07:06.188 --> 01:07:06.789
TALLER PERFORMANCE WHICH

01:07:06.856 --> 01:07:08.324
BECOMES ARE. A REAL CHALLENGE

01:07:08.391 --> 01:07:10.059
TO SEE WHETHER NOT EVERYBODY'S

01:07:10.126 --> 01:07:12.194
GETTING THIS CURRICULUM- THAT

01:07:12.261 --> 01:07:13.929
BECOMES A MAJOR CHALLENGE THAT

01:07:13.996 --> 01:07:14.930
SO THEY ARE YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU

01:07:14.997 --> 01:07:17.666
TURN THOSE KIDS ON. OW DO YOU

01:07:17.733 --> 01:07:18.601
HELP THOSE TEACHERS UNDERSTAND

01:07:18.667 --> 01:07:21.270
WHAT THEY NEED TO DO. TO RELATE

01:07:21.337 --> 01:07:23.806
TO THOSE STUDENTS. TO MOTIVATE

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:25.708
THEM TO ACCEPT THE TO BASICALLY

01:07:25.775 --> 01:07:27.009
MEET THOSE CHALLENGES AND THAT

01:07:27.076 --> 01:07:29.912
IT THERE. AND WE CAN'T WAIT TO

01:07:29.979 --> 01:07:30.913
THE END OF THE YEAR. YEAH ON.

01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:32.648
TO YOU GO THROUGH THIS I'M HAVE

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:33.649
BEEN IN CLASSROOMS WHERE.

01:07:33.716 --> 01:07:34.517
TEACHERS ARE VERY SUCCESSFUL IN

01:07:34.583 --> 01:07:36.419
DOING THIS AND THEY'RE PROBABLY

01:07:36.485 --> 01:07:38.154
NOT DOING AS MUCH OF THE-

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:40.956
MENTAL AT. OF GYMNASTICS THAT

01:07:41.023 --> 01:07:42.491
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY

01:07:42.558 --> 01:07:44.760
HAVE TO LOOK UP EVERY TEST

01:07:44.827 --> 01:07:45.761
SCHOOL WE HAVE TO FIND. THE

01:07:45.828 --> 01:07:46.695
NAME OF THE PERSON. FIND AT

01:07:46.762 --> 01:07:48.397
EVERY LITTLE. THERE THEY

01:07:48.464 --> 01:07:49.532
SOMEHOW ANOTHER FROM HOME. IN

01:07:49.598 --> 01:07:51.333
OTHER THINGS THAT ARE GETTING.

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:54.403
IN THIS. BEGIN POST. WHETHER

01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:57.473
THE KEY IS GET. THIS OF.

01:07:57.540 --> 01:08:00.409
THINKING THAT ARE. SO I THINK.

01:08:00.476 --> 01:08:03.746
WHAT WE TO PUT. BECAUSE ALL.

01:08:03.813 --> 01:08:14.757
ALL OF. HIM TO BOOK. AND YOU

01:08:14.824 --> 01:08:16.125
BEGIN TO DO IT AND THEN YOU

01:08:16.192 --> 01:08:17.793
START QUESTIONING YOURSELF. AND

01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:19.328
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO

01:08:19.395 --> 01:08:21.564
GO BACK TO THE COMPUTER. AND

01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:22.164
FIND IT IF IT'S REALLY REALLY

01:08:22.231 --> 01:08:24.633
RIGHT. IT IS TAKE YOUR LIFETIME

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:25.835
AND YOU WON'T GET VERY FAR

01:08:25.901 --> 01:08:27.303
BECAUSE YOU BEGIN TO RELY UPON

01:08:27.369 --> 01:08:28.804
THAT RATHER THAN WHAT YOU KNOW.

01:08:28.871 --> 01:08:31.106
AND HOW TO ASSESS WHAT'S GOING

01:08:31.173 --> 01:08:33.976
ON SO. SO I YOU KNOW I BECOME

01:08:34.043 --> 01:08:34.710
FRUSTRATED BECAUSE THERE ARE

01:08:34.777 --> 01:08:36.812
SOME FOLKS WHO. WHO REALLY KNOW

01:08:36.879 --> 01:08:38.814
THIS STUFF. WHO REALLY KNOW

01:08:38.881 --> 01:08:40.382
WHAT THEY'RE SOME EXAMPLES OF

01:08:40.449 --> 01:08:41.650
SOME SCHOOLS WHO REALLY ARE

01:08:41.717 --> 01:08:43.285
SUCCESSFUL. I WAS READING ONE

01:08:43.352 --> 01:08:44.920
IN SAN FRANCISCO YOU PROBABLY

01:08:44.987 --> 01:08:45.921
HEARD THE ONE IN SAN FRANCISCO

01:08:45.988 --> 01:08:47.857
WITH THESE KIDS. IN MATH I JUST

01:08:47.923 --> 01:08:49.925
BLOWING THE TOPS OFF. SO THE

01:08:49.992 --> 01:08:51.227
QUESTION THEN BECOMES. YOU KNOW

01:08:51.293 --> 01:08:52.695
WHAT ARE THEY DOING. AND WHAT

01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:54.230
WE READ IN THE COMPUTER

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:57.399
PRINTOUT. VERSUS LOOKING AT THE

01:08:57.466 --> 01:08:59.101
PEOPLE WHO WERE SUCCESSFUL. YOU

01:08:59.168 --> 01:09:00.135
KNOW WE FIND THAT TO BE TRUE A

01:09:00.202 --> 01:09:01.604
LOT IN THE FOURTEEN SCHOOLS

01:09:01.670 --> 01:09:02.838
AROUND HERE WITH THESE KIDS IS

01:09:02.905 --> 01:09:05.774
BLOWING THE TOP OFF OF THE MAP.

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:07.943
AND SO. LOOKING AT WHAT WHAT'S

01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:08.878
WRONG WITH THESE. NORMALLY BE

01:09:08.944 --> 01:09:11.847
FAIL BUT ARE NOT. YOU KNOW. AND

01:09:11.914 --> 01:09:12.948
FIGURE NOT BECAUSE WE SET THE

01:09:13.015 --> 01:09:14.283
STANDARD WE'VE GOT THE MATERIAL

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:15.951
WE WANT THEM TO LEARN. BUT WE

01:09:16.018 --> 01:09:17.253
NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO YOU

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:18.587
RELATE TO THE STUDENTS HOW DO

01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:19.889
YOU MOTIVATE THE STUDENTS TO

01:09:19.955 --> 01:09:21.624
LEARN. HOW DO YOU GET THE

01:09:21.690 --> 01:09:25.127
MOVIE. IN AND THAT'S THAT THAT

01:09:25.194 --> 01:09:25.961
IN ITSELF IS THE ART OF

01:09:26.028 --> 01:09:27.963
TEACHING. AND SO I DON'T WANT

01:09:28.030 --> 01:09:29.798
TO BE VALUE WHAT I. CHOOSE

01:09:29.865 --> 01:09:32.468
HAVE. AS THE DATA WELL THE TO

01:09:32.535 --> 01:09:34.036
HOPEFULLY LOOK INTO AND FIGURE

01:09:34.103 --> 01:09:35.371
OUT WHAT'S GOING ON WELL WE

01:09:35.437 --> 01:09:37.706
SEEM TO READ AMOUNT OF STUDIES.

01:09:37.773 --> 01:09:38.574
I MEAN I THINK THOSE THINGS ARE

01:09:38.641 --> 01:09:40.342
IMPORTANT IF YOU GET TO A POINT

01:09:40.409 --> 01:09:41.477
WE RUNS A WALL AND YOU JUST

01:09:41.544 --> 01:09:42.945
CAN'T. SEEM TO MOVE IT YOU WANT

01:09:43.012 --> 01:09:45.314
TO FIGURE. IT IS. BUT

01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:46.448
OFTENTIMES WEEDS SECOND GUESS

01:09:46.515 --> 01:09:49.718
OUR FOLKS ABILITY TO DO IT. AND

01:09:49.785 --> 01:09:51.353
AS A RESULT WE COMPLICATE

01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:53.322
TEACHING. SO A BIG. A BY IN

01:09:53.389 --> 01:09:56.358
SOME. AND ONE TEACHING BECOMES

01:09:56.425 --> 01:09:58.594
ROLLED. IT IS D. IS GOING TO

01:09:58.661 --> 01:10:01.597
DIP KIDS COME WITH ABILITY. MAY

01:10:01.664 --> 01:10:02.831
LOSE THIS PAST IN THIS DESIGN.

01:10:02.898 --> 01:10:04.667
AND IT'S AND IT'S A BIT KEY TO

01:10:04.733 --> 01:10:07.202
GET. ON BECAUSE KID'S. HAS COME.

01:10:07.269 --> 01:10:08.604
TO THE SUBJECT MATTER. SO I'M-

01:10:08.671 --> 01:10:13.175
HOPING THAT. THAT ALL OF THE-

01:10:13.242 --> 01:10:13.776
BILL IN THE DOT. WE SPENT WE

01:10:13.842 --> 01:10:14.810
HAVE DONE THE- THAT WOULD THAT

01:10:14.877 --> 01:10:17.012
THIS. SUPPORTED WITH. WE REALLY

01:10:17.079 --> 01:10:18.581
SUPPORTS US IN IN THE IN A WAY

01:10:18.647 --> 01:10:20.749
BUT DOES NOT TAKE AWAY. THE

01:10:20.816 --> 01:10:22.418
HUMAN ELEMENT OF TEACHING. THAT

01:10:22.484 --> 01:10:24.386
THIS IS A PASSION THAT THE THAT

01:10:24.453 --> 01:10:25.921
YOU CAN REACH THESE KIDS AND

01:10:25.988 --> 01:10:27.389
THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE. AND

01:10:27.456 --> 01:10:28.691
THAT WE BEGIN TO LOOK AROUND

01:10:28.757 --> 01:10:29.758
BECAUSE LIKE I SAY EERY NOW

01:10:29.825 --> 01:10:31.560
AND THEN I RUN ACROSS. SOMEONE

01:10:31.627 --> 01:10:32.761
WHO'S DONE IT YEAH THE WHOLE

01:10:32.828 --> 01:10:34.196
SCHOOL LIKE IN SAN FRANCISCO

01:10:34.263 --> 01:10:36.231
AND I'M DETERMINED TO GET THERE

01:10:36.298 --> 01:10:37.132
TO SEE THE SCHOOL. WHERE THEY

01:10:37.199 --> 01:10:39.835
JUST BLOWN THE STOCKS OFFER

01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:42.237
MET. IN THIS IN THIS POOR

01:10:42.304 --> 01:10:43.439
NEIGHBORHOOD OF KIDS NORMALLY.

01:10:43.505 --> 01:10:46.075
BE AND- WE TO FIGURE THAT OUT

01:10:46.141 --> 01:10:47.109
AND LET THAT MOTIVATES

01:10:47.176 --> 01:10:48.577
SOMETIMES OUR TEACHERS AND OUR

01:10:48.644 --> 01:10:50.112
PRINCIPLES TO. TO DO SOME

01:10:50.179 --> 01:10:51.347
THINGS OR SOME OF THESE

01:10:51.413 --> 01:10:52.681
INSTITUTES THAT LIKE JOE

01:10:52.748 --> 01:10:54.450
JOHNSON OTHERS ONE WHICH REALLY

01:10:54.516 --> 01:10:56.151
FOCUSON UNDERPERFORMING

01:10:56.218 --> 01:10:57.886
SCHOOLS. AND FIGURE OUT WHAT

THESE FOLKS ARE DOING. AND DO

01:10:59.588 --> 01:11:02.124
THAT BECAUSE- WE'VE ALREADY

01:11:02.191 --> 01:11:03.392
SPENT WHAT IS A SIX SEVEN YEARS

01:11:03.459 --> 01:11:05.461
NOW WOULD SMARTER BALANCED AND

01:11:05.527 --> 01:11:06.962
COMMON CORE AND OTHER THAN

01:11:07.029 --> 01:11:08.497
THAT. AND BILLIONS AND BILLIONS

01:11:08.564 --> 01:11:09.932
OF DOLLARS AND THAT'S OKAY I

01:11:09.999 --> 01:11:10.599
MEAN YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO DO

01:11:10.666 --> 01:11:12.034
SOMETHING. STAFF DEVELOPMENT

01:11:12.101 --> 01:11:14.303
TRAINING. BUT AS I LISTEN TO

01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:15.571
THIS IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IT'S

01:11:15.638 --> 01:11:17.806
EXHAUSTING. OF YOU KNOW TO GO

01:11:17.873 --> 01:11:19.775

THEN YOU AND THEN YOU REALIZE

01:11:24.013 --> 01:11:26.348
YOU SPENT DAYS. DOING THIS AND

01:11:26.415 --> 01:11:27.316
NOT DOING WHAT YOU KNOW SHE

01:11:27.383 --> 01:11:28.417
SHOULD. IN TERMS OF THE

01:11:28.484 --> 01:11:31.186
CLASSROOM SO. I HOPE WE COME IN.

01:11:40.963 --> 01:11:41.697
UP IN ALL THE OTHER STUFF. AND

01:11:41.764 --> 01:11:43.866
GET TO THE QUESTION OF. HOW DO

01:11:43.932 --> 01:11:45.200
YOU KNOW THIS KID PICKED UP

01:11:45.267 --> 01:11:47.136
THIS TOPIC HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY

01:11:47.202 --> 01:11:48.637
REALLY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

01:11:48.704 --> 01:11:51.473
AND HOW AND YOUR ASSESSMENT AS

01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:53.242
A TEACHER. TO KNOW THAT THEY'VE

01:11:53.308 --> 01:11:54.510
THAT THEY'VE ACTUALLY MASTERED

01:11:54.576 --> 01:11:56.412
THIS. AND THAT YOU CAN LAYER IT

01:11:56.478 --> 01:11:57.546
AND BUILD ON SOMETHING ELSE IS

01:11:57.613 --> 01:11:58.947
REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT AND

01:11:59.014 --> 01:12:00.549
SELF. I DON'T KNOW I JUST GOT

01:12:00.616 --> 01:12:02.985
TIRED. OF BEING VERY EXHAUSTED

01:12:03.052 --> 01:12:04.353
AND I'VE TALKED TO FORTY YEARS

01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:06.488
AND I THOUGHT LORD BY TO DO ALL

01:12:06.555 --> 01:12:08.424
THAT. I'M NOT SURE AB ONE EVER

01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:09.925
TEACH THE CLASS. BUT WITHOUT

01:12:09.992 --> 01:12:11.827
THE PASSION. IN THE INNATE

01:12:11.894 --> 01:12:13.328
ABILITY OF A GOOD TEACHER TO

01:12:13.395 --> 01:12:14.997
FIGURE OUT WHEN THE BILL WHEN

01:12:15.064 --> 01:12:16.832
THE LIGHT GOES OFF. OKAY THANK

01:12:16.899 --> 01:12:19.134
YOU DOCTOR ROBERT I AGREE YOU

01:12:19.201 --> 01:12:19.635
CAN'T STANDARDIZED GOOD

01:12:19.702 --> 01:12:21.136
TEACHING. BECAUSE IT'S AN ART.

01:12:21.203 --> 01:12:22.571
AND EVERYBODY BRINGS YOUR SKILL

01:12:22.638 --> 01:12:24.506
SET AND THEIR PERSONALITY. TO

01:12:24.573 --> 01:12:26.842
MATCH THOSE. THAT EXIST IN ANY

01:12:26.909 --> 01:12:27.910
CLASS ACROSS THE STATE OF

01:12:27.976 --> 01:12:31.013
CALIFORNIA WE DO HAVE

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:31.613
STANDARDIZED TEST. AND THAT'S

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:34.049
THAT'S A CHANNEL HERE I. KNOW

01:12:34.116 --> 01:12:36.652
YOU. WE SHOULD GIVE US HOPE.

01:12:36.719 --> 01:12:40.422
THAT HER BRAG. AFTER SCHOOL

01:12:40.489 --> 01:12:43.058
AND- VERY DIVERSE SCHOOL AND IN

01:12:43.125 --> 01:12:45.027
PARTICULAR THEY ARE FOCUSED ON

01:12:45.094 --> 01:12:46.361
MATH AND IN PARTICULAR THEY DO

01:12:46.428 --> 01:12:48.030
A VERY GOOD JOB ON MASS SO GO

01:12:48.097 --> 01:12:49.865
AHEAD AND DO A TWO THREE MINUTE

01:12:49.932 --> 01:12:52.101
ADVERTISED. WE'D LIKE TO INVITE

01:12:52.167 --> 01:12:54.103
YOU TO OUR SCHOOLS COME JOIN US

01:12:54.169 --> 01:12:57.206
AND ASKING DIEGO. AND YOU'RE

01:12:57.272 --> 01:12:58.273
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND THAT'S WHY

01:12:58.340 --> 01:12:59.675
A PART OF WHAT MIKE SAID WAS

01:12:59.742 --> 01:13:00.809
ARE WE ASKING THE RIGHT

01:13:00.876 --> 01:13:02.544
QUESTION. YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE

01:13:02.611 --> 01:13:03.946
DO KNOW THAT AND THE MOST

01:13:04.012 --> 01:13:07.883
IMPACTFUL- AND- MEASURE OF

01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:09.618
STUDENT SUCCESS IS THE

01:13:09.685 --> 01:13:11.386
INSTRUCTION AND HOW THE

01:13:11.453 --> 01:13:12.354
INSTRUCTIONS FORM BASED AND

01:13:12.421 --> 01:13:14.289
FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT. I KNOW

01:13:14.356 --> 01:13:15.257
THAT FROM THE NATIONAL

01:13:15.324 --> 01:13:18.026
INSTITUTE OF SCHOOL LEADERSHIP-

01:13:18.093 --> 01:13:20.462
AND WE ARE AS A COUNTRY WE ARE

01:13:20.529 --> 01:13:22.531
EIGHT IN MATHEMATICS WHERE

01:13:22.598 --> 01:13:23.499
THIRTY SIX. THIRTY AND WE HAVE

01:13:23.565 --> 01:13:24.867
COVERAGE THERE FOR SINCE THE

01:13:24.933 --> 01:13:28.370
INCEPTION OF PIZZA. SO I WANT

01:13:28.437 --> 01:13:28.937
TO ADDRESS IS THE MATH REAL

01:13:29.004 --> 01:13:31.774
QUICK- YOU KNOW WHAT OF ONE OF

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:34.810
MY MATH HERE SAID IT BEST. YOU

01:13:34.877 --> 01:13:38.247
KNOW. FIFTY BOB. HOW WE TEACH

01:13:38.313 --> 01:13:40.449
BUT IS COMPETE HOW WE NEED TO

01:13:40.516 --> 01:13:44.987
TEACH NOW. COMPETES WITH TWELVE

01:13:45.053 --> 01:13:45.788
SIX TWELVE YEARS OF LEARNING

01:13:45.854 --> 01:13:48.023
MATHEMATICS RIGHT AS LEARNERS

01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:50.058
OF MATHEMATICS AND AS TEACHERS

01:13:50.125 --> 01:13:50.826
HOW MANY YEARS ON TOP OF THAT

01:13:50.893 --> 01:13:52.027
WE HAVE BEEN TEACHING

01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:54.263
MATHEMATICS SO TO YOUR POINT IT

01:13:54.329 --> 01:13:54.930
DOES TAKE PROFESSIONAL

01:13:54.997 --> 01:13:56.899
DEVELOPMENT AND THERE WAS MONEY

01:13:56.965 --> 01:13:57.432
PUT TOWARDS PROFESSIONAL

01:13:57.499 --> 01:14:00.169
DEVELOPMENT WHEN COMMON CORE.

01:14:00.235 --> 01:14:02.171
WAS IMPLEMENTED BUT IT WASN'T

01:14:02.237 --> 01:14:04.273
ENOUGH AND IT REALLY DOES TAKE

01:14:04.339 --> 01:14:05.974
CONTINUOUS PROFESSIONAL

01:14:06.041 --> 01:14:06.608
DEVELOPMENT ONGOING

01:14:06.675 --> 01:14:08.143
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

01:14:08.210 --> 01:14:10.179
BECAUSE IT TAKES A LOT CHANGE

01:14:10.245 --> 01:14:12.347
THE WAY WE INSTRUCT I'M ALSO

01:14:12.414 --> 01:14:13.916
ACCORDING TO PEACE ABOUT 50% OF

01:14:13.982 --> 01:14:15.150
THE ADULTS COUNTRY DON'T

01:14:15.217 --> 01:14:16.785
BELIEVE THEY'RE GOOD AT MATH.

01:14:16.852 --> 01:14:19.922
AND ACTUALLY I'VE DONE THAT.

01:14:19.988 --> 01:14:20.689
CHECK THE CONSULTING FOR TO

01:14:20.756 --> 01:14:22.157
MALCOLM MY AS WELL AND WE'VE

01:14:22.224 --> 01:14:22.758
TALKED OVER THE- IN

01:14:22.825 --> 01:14:24.560
INTERNATIONALLY AS WELL. AND IN

01:14:24.626 --> 01:14:27.496
SACRAMENTO YES WE DID- AND

01:14:27.563 --> 01:14:28.630
THAT'S A TRUE STATISTICS AND

01:14:28.697 --> 01:14:30.933
IT'S OUR EXPERT IN ITS OUR

01:14:30.999 --> 01:14:32.768
EXPERIENCE AS WELL. AND WE HAVE

01:14:32.835 --> 01:14:33.869
TO DO SOMETHING TO CHANGE THAT

01:14:33.936 --> 01:14:34.736
BUT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN THAT

01:14:34.803 --> 01:14:36.939
QUICKLY SO WANTED TO ONE OF THE

01:14:37.005 --> 01:14:38.841
THINGS THAT I AM ABLE TO DO IT

01:14:38.907 --> 01:14:39.942
MY SCHOOL BECAUSE I'M A TITLE

01:14:40.008 --> 01:14:41.210
ONE SCHOOLS I DO HAVE FEDERAL

01:14:41.276 --> 01:14:42.878
MONEY AND THAT'S HOW I PAY FOR

01:14:42.945 --> 01:14:44.213
MIKE. BUT THAT'S YOU KNOW NOT

01:14:44.279 --> 01:14:46.782
EVERY SCHOOL PRIORITIZES THAT

01:14:46.849 --> 01:14:47.850
SO I'M NOT GETTING ANY

01:14:47.916 --> 01:14:50.018
ADDITIONAL FUNDING I'M SEEN MY

01:14:50.085 --> 01:14:51.253
SITE FUNDS IN ORDER TO

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:53.222
ACCOMPLISH THAT BUT IT DOES

01:14:53.288 --> 01:14:54.089
TAKE A LOT IT TAKES A LOT OF.

01:14:54.156 --> 01:14:56.658
PERFECT DEVELOPMENT ON PRACTICE.

01:14:56.725 --> 01:14:58.861
DEVELOP TRULY UNDERSTAND WHAT

01:14:58.927 --> 01:14:59.862
KIDS KNOWING ASKING US FOR

01:14:59.928 --> 01:15:01.096
QUESTIONS WHAT DO WHAT DO THEY

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:02.831
NEED TO LEARN. YOU KNOW HOW WE

01:15:02.898 --> 01:15:04.533
GOING TO MEASURE WHAT WE DO

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:05.534
WHEN THEY'VE ALREADY LOOK AT

01:15:05.601 --> 01:15:06.468
WHAT WE DO WHEN THEY HAPPENED

01:15:06.535 --> 01:15:08.804
TO WE AND OUR TEACHER. NEED TO

01:15:08.871 --> 01:15:11.974
A QUICK. GIVE THEM AT SENATE

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:15.010
BILL'S CASH. MAKE BEST

01:15:15.077 --> 01:15:15.744
INSTRUCTIONAL THE- BUT IF DON'T

01:15:15.811 --> 01:15:16.578
HAVE THE KIND AND PEDAGOGICAL

01:15:16.645 --> 01:15:17.145
KNOWLEDGE. TYPICAL TO MAKE

01:15:17.212 --> 01:15:20.048
THOSE TO. AND THEY TEND TO-

01:15:20.115 --> 01:15:21.717
DEFAULT TO WHAT EVER CURRICULUM

01:15:21.783 --> 01:15:23.118
THEY MIGHT HALF AND TRUST THAT

01:15:23.185 --> 01:15:24.586
MORE THAN TRUST THEIR ART OF

01:15:24.653 --> 01:15:26.221
TEACHING. AND THEIR AND THEIR

01:15:26.288 --> 01:15:27.623
EXPERTISE AS A TEACHER. THAT'S

01:15:27.689 --> 01:15:29.057
WHY I WANT TO HAVE EVERYONE OF

01:15:29.124 --> 01:15:30.192
OUR TEACHERS BE MATHEMATICS AND

01:15:30.259 --> 01:15:32.394
LITERACY EXPERTS. YOU KNOW THE

01:15:32.461 --> 01:15:33.528
INTERESTING THING WHEN WE

01:15:33.595 --> 01:15:35.931
DECIDED THAT- EVERYONE WAS

01:15:35.998 --> 01:15:37.499
GOING TO DO TAKE ALGEBRA IN SAN

01:15:37.566 --> 01:15:38.934
DIEGO UNIFIED WHEN I WAS ON THE

01:15:39.001 --> 01:15:41.136
SCHOOL BOARD- I HAD PARENTS.

01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:43.772
UPSET CALLING ME. BECAUSE THEY

01:15:43.839 --> 01:15:44.339
DIDN'T WANT THE KIDS TO TAKE

01:15:44.406 --> 01:15:46.675
ALGEBRA. AND THEY ALWAYS SAY.

01:15:46.742 --> 01:15:49.244
ME YOU KNOW I MEAN I WAS NEVER

01:15:49.311 --> 01:15:50.345
GOOD AT MATH I MEAN YOU KNOW.

01:15:50.412 --> 01:15:52.381
AND I WOULD ALWAYS ASSN THE

01:15:52.447 --> 01:15:53.448
CRITICAL QUESTION DO YOU THINK

01:15:53.515 --> 01:15:57.386
IT. IS A TWO. AT SALEM. NOT AS

01:15:57.452 --> 01:15:59.588
A WITH THE DON'T. KIDS THAT.

01:15:59.655 --> 01:16:03.058
BECAUSE MOST. TO DON'T WELL IN

01:16:03.125 --> 01:16:04.493
MATH KIDS. DO WELL IN MATH

01:16:04.559 --> 01:16:05.093
BECAUSE THEY'VE ALREADY. THIS

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:06.428
THAT IF THEY DO GIVE US OR DO

01:16:06.495 --> 01:16:08.563
YOU. OKAY BECAUSE THEY DID GET.

01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:10.632
IT WELL. SO WE DO THINK. MATH

01:16:10.699 --> 01:16:17.105
COMES. SO I. BE THAT SOME

01:16:17.172 --> 01:16:17.940
PEOPLE DO SOME PEOPLE DON'T

01:16:18.006 --> 01:16:18.640
THAT'S THEIR ADDED. SOMETHING

01:16:18.707 --> 01:16:20.776
THINK DIDN'T GET THE MATH. YEAH

01:16:20.842 --> 01:16:24.446
I GOT THERE IS NO MATTER. I

01:16:24.513 --> 01:16:25.447
THINK DOCTOR WHATEVER'S ON TO

01:16:25.514 --> 01:16:28.183
GO OVER YOUR STE IN SAM. SO I'M-

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:29.651
YEAH FIND A STORIES AND THE

01:16:29.718 --> 01:16:30.986
COME DOWN WILL LOVE TO HAVE A

01:16:31.053 --> 01:16:31.753
WE DO ROW WITH TEACHER AND

01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:35.457
OTHERS TO ALL THE SO. RIGHT

01:16:35.524 --> 01:16:37.626
FROM WITH THAT MR MCCARTY. HAD

01:16:37.693 --> 01:16:39.194
A- DATA I'M GONNA TURN THIS

01:16:39.261 --> 01:16:39.795
OVER YOU MAY WEBER I'VE GOT A

01:16:39.861 --> 01:16:41.663
WALKING THROUGH FOR FIVE. YEAH

01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:42.965
THESE ARE JUST OVERALL. THE IN

01:16:43.031 --> 01:16:45.600
ANY OF YOU COULD. THANK IN A-

01:16:45.667 --> 01:16:48.670
THE START TEST IT WAS. IT WAS.

01:16:48.737 --> 01:16:49.972
PHASED OUT INTO THE- TWO TWENTY

01:16:50.038 --> 01:16:52.107
THIRTEEN CORRECT. YEAH AND- ONE

01:16:52.174 --> 01:16:54.109
ONE OF THE INTENTS WAS TO. WAS

01:16:54.176 --> 01:16:55.744
TO HAVE A- GREATER VIEW OF THE

01:16:55.811 --> 01:16:57.212
SUBJECT MATTER OF THE STUDENTS

01:16:57.279 --> 01:16:58.914
AND NOT HAVE YOU TEACHING TO

01:16:58.981 --> 01:17:00.983
THE TEST SO. DO YOU AS A BODY

01:17:01.049 --> 01:17:04.519
THINK THAT. YOU KNOW FIVE TEN

01:17:04.586 --> 01:17:05.087
YEARS LATER THAT WE PUT YOU

01:17:05.153 --> 01:17:10.492
THAT GOAL. THE SHORT ANSWER NO

01:17:10.559 --> 01:17:11.860
HOWEVER I DON'T THINK YOU CAN

01:17:11.927 --> 01:17:13.562
ACHIEVE THAT GOAL IN FIVE TO

01:17:13.628 --> 01:17:15.797
SEVEN YEARS I THINK SEVEN TO

01:17:15.864 --> 01:17:16.965
TEN YEARS IT LEADS TO THE

01:17:17.032 --> 01:17:18.533
DESTRUCTION OF OUR SIZE IS THE

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:21.003
TIME IT TAKES FOR ANY OF THESE-

01:17:21.069 --> 01:17:22.671
MASSIVE CHANGES LIKE SWITCHING

01:17:22.738 --> 01:17:24.039
OVER TO COMMON CORE LIKE

01:17:24.106 --> 01:17:25.307
SWITCHING OVER THE ASPECT

01:17:25.374 --> 01:17:27.509
MATTERS. AND AS A BELIEVE IT

01:17:27.576 --> 01:17:29.344
MCCARTY OF DRESSES. MISS

01:17:29.411 --> 01:17:30.979
WEBBER'S POINT WHICH IS THE

01:17:31.046 --> 01:17:32.180
REASON THOSE OTHER SCHOOLS ARE

01:17:32.247 --> 01:17:34.583
DOING SO WELL IS THOSE TEACHERS

01:17:34.649 --> 01:17:37.252
HAVE BODY INTO THOSE PROGRAMS

01:17:37.319 --> 01:17:39.488
FOR STUDENTS WHO SHOULD BE

01:17:39.554 --> 01:17:43.058
FAILING THOSE PROGRAMS. WITH CS

01:17:43.125 --> 01:17:44.860
TEASER THE START TEST WE BOUGHT

01:17:44.926 --> 01:17:46.661
IT IS BECAUSE WE KNEW IT WAS

01:17:46.728 --> 01:17:48.397
AFFECTING OUR API WHICH WAS

01:17:48.463 --> 01:17:49.631
SOMEHOW GOING TO GET A SEAT

01:17:49.698 --> 01:17:51.600
THAT BY PRINCIPLE WE KNEW WHAT

01:17:51.666 --> 01:17:53.502
THE CALIFORNIA. LEADS THE EXAM

01:17:53.568 --> 01:17:55.303
THE KIDS HAVE TO PASS SO THEY

01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:56.972
DON'T GRADUATE SO THAT SENSE

01:17:57.039 --> 01:17:59.741
OF. URGENCY CREATED A BY IN

01:17:59.808 --> 01:18:01.209
THAT THE ASPECT DOES NOT YET

01:18:01.276 --> 01:18:04.146
HAVE WITH. AND SO. IT TAKES.

01:18:04.212 --> 01:18:07.449
LONGER YOU MIGHT WANTED TO BUT

01:18:07.516 --> 01:18:09.184
I THINK MORE DEVELOPMENT AND OR

01:18:09.251 --> 01:18:11.319
RESOURCES MORE TRAINING. THAT'S

01:18:11.386 --> 01:18:15.023
THE KEY TO GET TEACHER BY AND

01:18:15.090 --> 01:18:15.924
WITHOUT TEACHER BY IN. I THINK

01:18:15.991 --> 01:18:20.529
IT HAPPENED. THEIR COSTS IN OUR

01:18:20.595 --> 01:18:23.432
OFF IS UNDER AS WE ARE IN. THE

01:18:23.498 --> 01:18:25.834
NEW SANCTIONS OUT THE PROGRAM

PROGRAM APPROVED STATUS. SO

01:18:41.283 --> 01:18:43.185
THEN WHY ASK TO DO AS A SCHOOL

01:18:43.251 --> 01:18:44.186
TO YOUR SINGLE PURPOSE UNITS

01:18:44.252 --> 01:18:46.221
SHE MET AND THEN THE DAILY ACE

DEALS YOU'RE GONNA GET THIS

01:18:56.631 --> 01:18:57.666
CREEP BACK OKAY WILL WHAT SORT.

01:18:57.732 --> 01:18:59.134
YOU CAN. THE TO. AND START

01:18:59.201 --> 01:19:00.168
TEACHING TO THE TEST SO YOU CAN

01:19:00.235 --> 01:19:01.770
MAKE THE ARGUMENT. BECAUSE THE

01:19:01.837 --> 01:19:03.605
TEST HAS BEEN VALIDATED. THAT

01:19:03.672 --> 01:19:05.307
IT'S AS RELIABLE AS THE S. A.

01:19:05.373 --> 01:19:08.143
T. TO PROTECT- FRESHMAN LEVEL

01:19:08.210 --> 01:19:09.611
PERFORMANCE AT THE UNIVERSITY

01:19:09.678 --> 01:19:11.279
FOR UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LEVEL.

01:19:11.346 --> 01:19:13.281
BUT WE ARE KIND OF CREEPING

01:19:13.348 --> 01:19:14.583
BACK NOW BECAUSE NOW I HAVE ONE

01:19:14.649 --> 01:19:16.585
THAT- CONTINUATION SCHOOL. A

01:19:16.651 --> 01:19:18.753
70% FREE REDUCED LUNCH 70% ON

01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:19.955
THE HEALTHY KIDS SURVEY.

01:19:20.021 --> 01:19:22.424
REGULAR SUBSTANCE ABUSE USERS-

01:19:22.491 --> 01:19:23.225
THIRTY THIRTY PERCENT-

01:19:23.291 --> 01:19:25.127
SPECIALLY POPULATION. AND NOW

01:19:25.193 --> 01:19:26.962
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW

01:19:27.028 --> 01:19:28.463
DO WE BOOST YOU KNOW ASPECTS.

01:19:28.530 --> 01:19:30.866
RIGHT AND SO THAT. GOING ON

01:19:30.932 --> 01:19:32.100
WITH. INSTEAD WE JUST WANT TO

01:19:32.167 --> 01:19:34.736
THE RANGE BE COMMITTED TO THEM.

01:19:34.803 --> 01:19:38.340
I AM SO. THE VALUE THE TEACHERS

01:19:38.406 --> 01:19:39.941
INCOME INTO THE EDGE COUPLE FOR

01:19:40.008 --> 01:19:40.775
CONTINUATION SCHOOL. BUT IN

01:19:40.842 --> 01:19:41.309
ORDER TO GET OUT OF. THE

01:19:41.376 --> 01:19:42.310
SANCTIONS IF YOU WILL YOU'VE

01:19:42.377 --> 01:19:43.145
GOT TO DO BETTER ON THE

01:19:43.211 --> 01:19:44.946
ASSESSMENTS. SO THERE IS A

01:19:45.013 --> 01:19:46.047
LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE US TO GO

01:19:46.114 --> 01:19:47.115
BACK TO TEACHING TOWARDS THE

01:19:47.182 --> 01:19:49.518
TEST. NOW AGAIN. THE TEST HAS

01:19:49.584 --> 01:19:51.620
BEEN VALIDATED SO NOT IN THE-

01:19:51.686 --> 01:19:53.421
IT'S NOT A BAD GUY SO I SAID MY

01:19:53.488 --> 01:19:54.623
FACT. IT'S NOT A BAD GOAL TO

01:19:54.689 --> 01:19:57.125
ASPIRE TO. I WE WOULD BE REMISS

01:19:57.192 --> 01:19:58.226
IF WE DIDN'T THINK WE WERE

01:19:58.293 --> 01:20:00.128
STEPPING INTO THAT. INTO THAT

01:20:00.195 --> 01:20:00.929
ROUND SO THE PROFESSIONAL

01:20:00.996 --> 01:20:02.097
DEVELOP THIS I WASN'T AS OUR

01:20:02.164 --> 01:20:03.532
TICKET THE FIRST TIME. BORDERS

01:20:03.598 --> 01:20:04.866
ARE TRYING TO SAY. WE WOULD.

01:20:04.933 --> 01:20:06.268
MUCH LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENING

01:20:06.334 --> 01:20:08.236
DOWN. IN SAN DIEGO WE WANT TO

01:20:08.303 --> 01:20:10.705
FOCUS ON THE HOW. HOW DO WE GET

01:20:10.772 --> 01:20:13.942
STUDENTS OVER THE BAR. NONE HOW

01:20:14.009 --> 01:20:15.777
DO WE- I. UNDERSTAND THE TEST

01:20:15.844 --> 01:20:17.112
QUESTIONS SO WE CAN MAKE. YOU

01:20:17.179 --> 01:20:18.246
KNOW. WE'RE JUST WE'RE WE'RE

01:20:18.313 --> 01:20:19.314
FOCUSING ON HOW DO YOU ASKED

01:20:19.381 --> 01:20:20.615
THE QUESTION VERSES THE

01:20:20.682 --> 01:20:22.217
LEARNING. THEIR WE LOST OUR WAY

01:20:22.284 --> 01:20:23.418
A LITTLE BIT OF FOR JUST TRYING

01:20:23.485 --> 01:20:25.587
TO GAME THE TEST. THAT MAKES

01:20:25.654 --> 01:20:27.189
SENSE. WANT TO THANK YOU- I'VE

01:20:27.255 --> 01:20:30.158
BEEN TOLD. BY THE CHAIR OKAY.

01:20:30.225 --> 01:20:31.726
WELL LET MORE. WHEN THEY WANT

01:20:31.793 --> 01:20:33.461
TO DO PUBLIC COMMENT OKAY OKAY

01:20:33.528 --> 01:20:34.863
THIS IS THE- THAT. BIT OF A

01:20:34.930 --> 01:20:36.298
DIFFERENT TOPIC AND I WAS

01:20:36.364 --> 01:20:38.600
HOPING- MISTER O'DONNELL IS

01:20:38.667 --> 01:20:40.602
HERE BUT- STAFF CAN REFER THIS

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:42.504
ISSUE TEN THIS IS ABOUT. THE

01:20:42.571 --> 01:20:44.973
TESTING INDUSTRY. AS FAR AS

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:48.777
ASSESSMENT. FOR COLLEGE AGE. SO

01:20:48.843 --> 01:20:51.413
WITH THAT TO. I WOULD NOT. DATE

01:20:51.479 --> 01:20:54.182
ON THE- ACT SAT. AND ALLOW YEAR

01:20:54.249 --> 01:20:56.985
SOME. AND MISTER DON AUTHORED A

01:20:57.052 --> 01:20:58.587
BILL WHICH I SUPPORTED WHICH

01:20:58.653 --> 01:20:59.688
SAYS THAT. YOU KNOW NO LOOK AT

01:20:59.754 --> 01:21:03.091
THIS THING AS- AND AS WELL

01:21:03.158 --> 01:21:03.625
THERE'S A HUGE INDUSTRY.

01:21:03.692 --> 01:21:04.593
CERTAIN PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO PAY

01:21:04.659 --> 01:21:07.629
A TON OF MONEY AND ON. AND A

01:21:07.696 --> 01:21:09.598
BETTER CHANCE OF COLLEGE THEN

01:21:09.664 --> 01:21:11.132
LIFE AND OTHER START ALWAYS GET

01:21:11.199 --> 01:21:12.234
STICKERS NOT PLACES HAVING

01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:15.570
SOME. ACT IN A CLASSROOM TACIT.

01:21:15.637 --> 01:21:17.706
ENTRY FRANKLY THE UC BORDER

01:21:17.772 --> 01:21:19.107
READ ME GET RID OF THE WHOLE

01:21:19.174 --> 01:21:20.342
THING IN THE FIRST PLACE WAS I

01:21:20.408 --> 01:21:21.476
THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE

01:21:21.543 --> 01:21:23.178
VIOLATING AS WELL BUT MY

01:21:23.245 --> 01:21:25.447
QUESTION TO YOU ALL IS THAT. IN

01:21:25.513 --> 01:21:26.848
SOME OF THAT STUFF THAT I'VE

01:21:26.915 --> 01:21:28.717
READ. THERE'S A POTENTIAL THAT

01:21:28.783 --> 01:21:31.086
THIS TASK COULD BE AT COLLEGE

01:21:31.152 --> 01:21:33.054
YOU READY ASSESSMENT FOR.

01:21:33.121 --> 01:21:35.523
ELEVENTH GRADE AND SO FORTH SO

01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:37.926
IS THAT A REALISTIC PERSPECTIVE%

01:21:37.993 --> 01:21:41.396
THIS POTENTIALLY- IT BE

01:21:41.463 --> 01:21:44.432
UTILIZED IN IN IN COLLEGE.

01:21:44.499 --> 01:21:46.935
APPLICATIONS AND ANALYSIS AND

01:21:47.002 --> 01:21:48.703
FOCUSED ON EVERY STUDENT HAVE

01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:50.005
THIS AND THERE WAS AN

01:21:50.071 --> 01:21:51.840
OPPORTUNITY. TO GET. FOR TEST

01:21:51.906 --> 01:21:54.876
FOR US BACK BUT EVERY STUDENT

01:21:54.943 --> 01:21:57.078
HAS IT. YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THIS

01:21:57.145 --> 01:21:58.880
YOU'RE NEVER UNIVERSALLY.

01:21:58.947 --> 01:22:04.919
AVAILABLE NO I MEAN. I DO AND

01:22:04.986 --> 01:22:07.322
IF I CAN. SPEAK TO THE WAYS. AS

01:22:07.389 --> 01:22:09.624
A TEACHER AND INDIVIDUAL WITH

01:22:09.691 --> 01:22:12.394
MY EXPERIENCE. IT KIND OF IS

01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:13.261
ALREADY LEADING THAT WAY

01:22:13.328 --> 01:22:16.798
BECAUSE THE OLD EAP QUESTIONS

01:22:16.865 --> 01:22:18.133
THAT CAL STATE HAD EMBEDDED IN

01:22:18.199 --> 01:22:20.702
THE PREVIOUS TEST TO DETERMINE

01:22:20.769 --> 01:22:22.437
COLLEGE READINESS. ARE THERE

01:22:22.504 --> 01:22:25.774
NOW IN THE US BACK AND COULD BE

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:27.075
DONE FOR THE SAME REASON. BUT

01:22:27.142 --> 01:22:29.811
AGAIN MY PERSONAL LOGICAL BRAIN

01:22:29.878 --> 01:22:31.946
SAYS WHAT ELEVENTH GRADERS

01:22:32.013 --> 01:22:33.548
READY FOR COLLEGE AND WHY ARE

01:22:33.615 --> 01:22:35.684
YOU BOTHERING WITH THEM. THE

01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:37.852
OTHER HALF THAT THAT I WEAR

01:22:37.919 --> 01:22:39.788
SAYS THAT MAKES THE S. BACK

01:22:39.854 --> 01:22:43.224
VALUABLE IN A- IN A IN A- IN A

01:22:43.291 --> 01:22:45.727
WAY THAT COULD BEING MEAN MORE

01:22:45.794 --> 01:22:48.096
THAN IT SHOULD AND SO I'LL JUST

01:22:48.163 --> 01:22:49.698
ECHO WHAT CHRIS SAID EARLIER

01:22:49.764 --> 01:22:51.032
ABOUT BECAUSE OF THE STATE.

01:22:51.099 --> 01:22:55.770
RIGHT YES. FOUR ONE COHORT IN

01:22:55.837 --> 01:22:57.806
ONE WINDOW FOR AN ENTIRE SCHOOL

01:22:57.872 --> 01:23:01.743
YEAH. SAID THAT THE ONE COSTS

01:23:01.810 --> 01:23:04.713
ABOUT ALL THAT'S- GIG SSNS CAN

01:23:04.779 --> 01:23:06.414
BE USED COLLEGE INTEREST

01:23:06.481 --> 01:23:07.615
ASSISTANCE CAN BE USED FOR DAY

01:23:07.682 --> 01:23:08.817
KEEPING THAT'S IF YOU LOOK AT

01:23:08.883 --> 01:23:09.684
SOME OF THE RESEARCH THE DONE

01:23:09.751 --> 01:23:10.585
AROUND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:23:10.652 --> 01:23:12.721
SYSTEM THEY HAVE MOVED TOWARDS

01:23:12.787 --> 01:23:14.789
THE TEACHERS GRADE IN A COLLEGE

01:23:14.856 --> 01:23:16.725
PREPARATORY ELECTIVE IN ENGLISH

01:23:16.791 --> 01:23:18.026
ABOUT AS BEING THE BEST

01:23:18.093 --> 01:23:19.027
PREDICTOR FOR COMMITTEE COLLEGE

01:23:19.094 --> 01:23:20.795
SUCCESS. SO HISTORICALLY WHEN

01:23:20.862 --> 01:23:22.063
YOU'RE USING SOME OF THE SENATE

01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:22.864
AS FAST AS A GATEKEEPER

01:23:22.931 --> 01:23:24.866
MECHANISM FOR- INTERESTING TO

01:23:24.933 --> 01:23:26.101
CREDIT BEARING UNIVERSITY

01:23:26.167 --> 01:23:28.236
COURSES- YOU WHAT YOU'LL SEE

01:23:28.303 --> 01:23:30.739
HISTORICALLY IS SINCE POVERTY

01:23:30.805 --> 01:23:32.006
AND UNDER REPRESENTS ARE GOING

01:23:32.073 --> 01:23:33.508
TO REPRESENT A GROUPS ARE MORE

01:23:33.575 --> 01:23:35.009
LIKELY TO BE TO DO THE

01:23:35.076 --> 01:23:36.211
REMEDIATION OF THE ASSESSMENT

01:23:36.277 --> 01:23:37.045
COMMITTEE WOULD SAY WELL NO

01:23:37.112 --> 01:23:37.912
WE'RE JUST TELLING YOU THAT'S

01:23:37.979 --> 01:23:39.447
WHAT THE RESULTS SAY BUT THEN.

01:23:39.514 --> 01:23:41.850
THERE ARE HABITS OF MINE- WORK

01:23:41.916 --> 01:23:43.718
ETHIC AND OTHER FACTORS THEY'RE

01:23:43.785 --> 01:23:46.287
GOING TO PLAY DID HAVE SHOWN

01:23:46.354 --> 01:23:46.788
THAT THOSE STUDENTS WHO

01:23:46.855 --> 01:23:48.990
PERFORMED WELL GETTING A HIGH

01:23:49.057 --> 01:23:51.126
SCHOOL WHEN I GO HAVE GONE ON

01:23:51.192 --> 01:23:52.427
TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND

01:23:52.494 --> 01:23:54.729
THERE ANY GAZING IS AND YOU CAN

01:23:54.796 --> 01:23:55.764
TALK ABOUT THE STATE IT'S-

01:23:55.830 --> 01:24:01.136
PUBLIC NOTICE TO. WHAT AND ARE.

01:24:01.202 --> 01:24:03.104
EIGHT THE SHORT. OF MANY CAR

01:24:03.171 --> 01:24:03.905
TUNES WAY INTO NON. GRAD

01:24:03.972 --> 01:24:05.039
BEARING FOR. SPECIFIC MEANINGS

01:24:05.106 --> 01:24:05.840
LANGUAGE ARTS. AND IS NO LONGER

01:24:05.907 --> 01:24:06.608
THE CASE AND THE STUDENTS ARE

01:24:06.674 --> 01:24:08.743
PASSING THE COLLEGE COURSES SO.

01:24:08.810 --> 01:24:11.045
I I'M I'M NOT STE. AS LONG AS

01:24:11.112 --> 01:24:11.913
THERE IS A ASSESSMENT THAT'S

01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:13.882
REQUIRED. IT PROBABLY DOES MAKE

01:24:13.948 --> 01:24:16.117
SENSE TO ALIGN THE S. BACK. TO

01:24:16.184 --> 01:24:17.819
SEE IF YOU IN UC SYSTEM SINCE

01:24:17.886 --> 01:24:19.587
IT'S OUR SYSTEM. BUT WE ALSO

01:24:19.654 --> 01:24:20.355
JUST NEED YOU KNOW LOW

01:24:20.422 --> 01:24:22.123
CAUTIONARY TALE. IF IT'S USED

01:24:22.190 --> 01:24:24.125
AS A GATE. TO PREVENT UNDER

01:24:24.192 --> 01:24:26.027
REPRESENTED GROUPS ARE A R. L.

01:24:26.094 --> 01:24:27.028
CFF ONTO THE COULD ACCOUNT

01:24:27.095 --> 01:24:28.863
STUDENTS. FROM ACCESSING HIGHER

01:24:28.930 --> 01:24:31.199
ED- THAT WOULD BE AN UNINTENDED

01:24:31.266 --> 01:24:32.100
CONSEQUENCE THAT I WOULD NOT

01:24:32.167 --> 01:24:33.234
LIKE TO SEE COME TO FRUITION.

01:24:33.301 --> 01:24:35.170
AND I THINK IN NO WAY. IS THE

01:24:35.236 --> 01:24:37.238
ASPECT READY TO BE A COLLEGE

01:24:37.305 --> 01:24:38.673
ENTRANCE TESTS. GIVEN THE

01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:40.341
CHALLENGES WE'VE HEARD TODAY.

01:24:40.408 --> 01:24:41.976
WE HAVE TO MASTER THE K. TWELVE

01:24:42.043 --> 01:24:43.044
SYSTEM BEFORE WE MOVE BEYOND

01:24:43.111 --> 01:24:45.146
THAT FOR SURE. SO I GET HIGH

01:24:45.213 --> 01:24:47.348
SOME SALES JUST DO THIS NOW

01:24:47.415 --> 01:24:48.716
THERE'S A LOT MORE TO IT

01:24:48.783 --> 01:24:52.921
EXACTLY THEN THAT. WOULD ARE.

01:24:52.987 --> 01:24:53.588
ANY OTHER MEMBERS WHO TO SPEAK.

01:24:53.655 --> 01:24:55.590
SEE OTHER COMMENTS BUT I

01:24:55.657 --> 01:24:57.091
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC MAY COME

01:24:57.158 --> 01:24:58.526
