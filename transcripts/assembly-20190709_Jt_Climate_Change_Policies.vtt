THE LEGISLATION ADMINISTRATION

00:37:07.224 --> 00:37:09.393

AND GREENHOUSE GASES.

00:37:16.601 --> 00:37:17.802
AND THESE ARE ACCOMPLISHMENTS

00:37:17.868 --> 00:37:20.204
THAT I THINK CALIFORNIA

00:37:20.271 --> 00:37:21.739
COLLECTIVELY -- SHOULD BE

00:37:21.806 --> 00:37:23.074
CELEBRATING.

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:24.642
OUR WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE

00:37:24.709 --> 00:37:26.143
EXTENDS BACK TO WHEN CARP WAS

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:28.579
CREATED OVER FIFTY YEARS AGO

00:37:28.646 --> 00:37:29.981
WITH THE GOALS OF ATTAINING AND

00:37:30.047 --> 00:37:32.116
MAINTAINING HEALTHY AIR QUALITY.

00:37:32.183 --> 00:37:33.618
PROTECTING THE PUBLIC FROM

00:37:33.684 --> 00:37:34.719
EXPOSURE TO TOXIC AIR

00:37:34.785 --> 00:37:36.253
CONTAMINANTS PROVIDING

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.888
INNOVATIVE APPROACHES FOR

00:37:37.955 --> 00:37:39.423
COMPLYING WITH AIR POLLUTION

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:41.525
RULES AND REGULATIONS AND LATER

00:37:41.592 --> 00:37:43.160
WITH REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS

00:37:43.227 --> 00:37:44.028
EMISSIONS.

00:37:44.095 --> 00:37:46.497
SO LET'S LOOK AT HOW WE'VE DONE.

00:37:46.564 --> 00:37:48.833
ON AIR QUALITY THE EPA SAYS

00:37:48.899 --> 00:37:50.401
HEALTH BASED STANDARDS AND IS

00:37:50.468 --> 00:37:52.269
REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW TO

00:37:52.336 --> 00:37:54.105
REVIEW HOW THOSE STANDARDS ARE

00:37:54.171 --> 00:37:55.906
COMPARING WITH THE LATEST

00:37:55.973 --> 00:37:57.875
SCIENCE. TO ENSURE THAT THEIR

00:37:57.942 --> 00:37:59.010
HEALTH PROTECTIVE.

00:37:59.076 --> 00:38:01.445
OXIDES OF NITROGEN CALL KNOCKS

00:38:01.512 --> 00:38:02.680
AT THE KEY SMOG FORMING

00:38:02.747 --> 00:38:04.348
POLLUTANTS THAT WE WORK TO

00:38:04.415 --> 00:38:06.484
CONTROL AND YOU HAVE A CHART IN

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:07.718
YOUR HAND OUT WHICH SHOWS

00:38:07.785 --> 00:38:09.186
CALIFORNIA'S PROGRESS.

00:38:09.253 --> 00:38:11.088
IN REDUCING SMOG FORMING KNOCKS

00:38:11.155 --> 00:38:13.791
EMISSIONS AS EVIDENCED BY STATE

00:38:13.858 --> 00:38:15.359
WIDE AIR MEASUREMENTS.

00:38:15.426 --> 00:38:17.461
THE CURVE THAT DROPS TO THE LEFT

00:38:17.528 --> 00:38:19.030
TO THE RIGHT SHOWS KNOCKS

00:38:19.096 --> 00:38:22.099
EMISSIONS DECREASING NEARLY 70%

00:38:22.166 --> 00:38:26.203
SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:27.838
BASED ON THE REGULATE SINCE THAT

00:38:27.905 --> 00:38:29.040
HAVE BEEN ENACTED TO DATE.

00:38:29.106 --> 00:38:29.607
THIS PROGRESS REFLECTS THE

00:38:29.674 --> 00:38:31.909
BENEFITS OF BOTH CARB AND EPA

00:38:31.976 --> 00:38:34.178
PROGRAMS FOR MOBILE SOURCES.

00:38:34.245 --> 00:38:36.147
WHITE CARS TRUCKS AND OTHER

00:38:36.213 --> 00:38:37.848
EQUIPMENT AS WELL AS AIR

00:38:37.915 --> 00:38:39.850
DISTRICT PROGRAMS FOR STATIONARY

00:38:39.917 --> 00:38:42.053
SOURCES -- BECAUSE THESE MOBILE

00:38:42.119 --> 00:38:45.089
SOURCES ARE RESPONSIBLE 480% OF

00:38:45.156 --> 00:38:47.324
KNOX EMISSIONS MORE STRINGENT

00:38:47.391 --> 00:38:49.527
ENGINE STANDARDS CLEANER FUELS

00:38:49.593 --> 00:38:51.696
AND INCENTIVES TO TURN OVER THE

00:38:51.762 --> 00:38:52.396
FLEET.

00:38:52.463 --> 00:38:53.764
HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR A

00:38:53.831 --> 00:38:56.467
LARGE PORTION OF THIS PROGRESS.

00:38:56.534 --> 00:38:58.369
FOR EXAMPLE EMISSIONS FROM A NEW

00:38:58.436 --> 00:39:02.740
CAR TODAY I'M 99% LESS THAN A

00:39:02.807 --> 00:39:04.642
CAR FROM THE EARLY NINETEEN

00:39:04.709 --> 00:39:06.010
SEVENTIES WHEN I FIRST STARTED

00:39:06.077 --> 00:39:07.478
WORKING IN THIS FIELD.

00:39:07.545 --> 00:39:10.681
SO A TINY FRACTION OF WHAT WAS

00:39:10.748 --> 00:39:12.917
ONCE ROUTINELY COMMENT.

00:39:12.983 --> 00:39:14.785
AS YOU KNOW THE STANDARD SAID

00:39:14.852 --> 00:39:16.754

00:39:22.793 --> 00:39:23.461
AIR.

00:39:23.527 --> 00:39:25.262
CARD IN THE DISTRICTS OF ALSO

00:39:25.329 --> 00:39:27.031
WORKED TO REDUCE RISK FROM

00:39:27.098 --> 00:39:28.432
EXPOSURE TO AIR TOXICS FROM

00:39:28.499 --> 00:39:29.967
INDUSTRIAL SOURCES LIKE

00:39:30.034 --> 00:39:31.902
REFINERIES SMALLER SOURCES LIKE

00:39:31.969 --> 00:39:34.438
GASOLINE STATIONS AND OTHER

00:39:34.505 --> 00:39:38.075
MOBILE SOURCES INCLUDING DIESEL

00:39:38.142 --> 00:39:39.076

00:39:39.143 --> 00:39:39.877
CALIFORNIA'S AIR TOXICS PROGRAM

00:39:39.944 --> 00:39:42.513
BEGAN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE

AND CONTROL ACT.

00:39:47.551 --> 00:39:48.519
SINCE THEN THE STATE HAS

00:39:48.586 --> 00:39:50.254
IDENTIFIED OVER TWO HUNDRED

00:39:56.961 --> 00:39:58.596
AND WE'VE ALSO ADOPTED NUMEROUS

00:39:58.662 --> 00:40:01.031
REGULATIONS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS.

00:40:01.098 --> 00:40:02.900
OF AN EXPOSURE TO THOSE

00:40:02.967 --> 00:40:05.202
POLLUTANTS -- FROM ALL KINDS OF

LEVELS OF BENZENE AND GASOLINE.

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:17.381
TODAY THE STATE'S EFFORTS

00:40:17.448 --> 00:40:19.116
CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON REDUCING

00:40:19.183 --> 00:40:21.485
EMISSIONS OF DIESEL PARTICULATES

00:40:21.552 --> 00:40:23.521
WHICH ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT 70% OF

00:40:23.587 --> 00:40:26.056
THE TOTAL NON CANCER RISK

00:40:26.123 --> 00:40:27.258

EMISSIONS.

00:40:33.931 --> 00:40:36.033
DIESEL PARTICULATE MATTER HAS

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:38.736
DECREASED APPROXIMATELY 80%

00:40:38.803 --> 00:40:40.638
SINCE NINETEEN NINETY MOBILE

00:40:40.704 --> 00:40:42.406
SOURCES LIKE HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS

00:40:42.473 --> 00:40:44.742
ARE RESPONSIBLE 490% OF THE

00:40:44.809 --> 00:40:47.144
TOXIC DIESEL PARTICULATE MATTER.

00:40:47.211 --> 00:40:48.779
SO PROGRAMS FOCUSED ON THESE

00:40:48.846 --> 00:40:50.548
SOURCES ARE PRIMARILY

00:40:50.614 --> 00:40:52.516
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SIGNIFICANT

00:40:52.583 --> 00:40:53.884
PROGRESS THAT HAS OCCURRED.

00:40:53.951 --> 00:40:55.753
AND OVER THE LAST TWENTY FIVE

HEALTH IMPACTS FROM AIR TOXIC

00:41:00.791 --> 00:41:05.329
EXPOSURE HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY

00:41:05.396 --> 00:41:06.864
ABOUT 75%.

00:41:06.931 --> 00:41:08.332
THE EXAMPLE THAT I GAVE FOR KNOX

00:41:08.399 --> 00:41:08.899
AND DIESEL PARTICULATE ARE

00:41:08.966 --> 00:41:09.700
INDICATIVE OF THE EMISSIONS

00:41:09.767 --> 00:41:11.135
REDUCTION TRENDS ACROSS THE

00:41:15.072 --> 00:41:16.574
INCLUDED IN THE HAND OUT.

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:17.875
IN GENERAL EMISSIONS HAVE BEEN

00:41:17.942 --> 00:41:19.577
TRENDING DOWN FOR CRITERIA

00:42:22.039 --> 00:42:23.974
BUT LET ME BE CLEAR THERE'S A

00:42:24.041 --> 00:42:26.243
LOT OF WORK STILL AHEAD OF US

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:28.178

THESE -- ADMISSIONS DATA ARE

00:44:06.477 --> 00:44:08.579
THEN REPORTED BY THE LOCAL AIR

00:44:08.645 --> 00:44:11.582
DISTRICTS THIS IS USEFUL DATA

00:44:11.648 --> 00:44:13.350
BUT IT DOES HAVE SOME WEAKNESSES.

00:44:13.417 --> 00:44:15.586
FOR EXAMPLE DIFFERENT DISTRICTS

00:44:15.652 --> 00:44:16.920
IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE

00:44:16.987 --> 00:44:19.223
USE DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES AND

00:44:19.289 --> 00:44:21.191
DATA COLLECTION FOR REPORTING

00:44:21.258 --> 00:44:22.526

00:44:23.627 --> 00:44:25.729
EVEN FROM THE SAME SOURCES.

00:44:25.796 --> 00:44:27.765
ADDITIONALLY SOME FACILITIES MAY

00:44:27.831 --> 00:44:30.167
REPORT CRITERIA POLLUTANTS EVERY

00:44:30.234 --> 00:44:31.735
THREE YEARS BECAUSE OF AIR

00:44:31.802 --> 00:44:33.237
DISTRICT REPORTING THRESHOLDS

00:44:33.303 --> 00:44:35.906

EIGHTY EIGHT HOT SPOTS PROGRAM.

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:44.581
SO WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE

00:44:44.648 --> 00:44:46.650
DISTRICTS TO HARMONIZE REPORTING

00:44:46.717 --> 00:44:48.852
METHODS AS WELL AS THE REPORTING

00:44:48.919 --> 00:44:50.721

A. B. IX SEVENTEEN PROCESS.

00:44:53.457 --> 00:44:54.425
AND I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT A

00:44:54.491 --> 00:44:56.493
LITTLE BIT LATER STILL THE

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:58.328
POLLUTION MAPPING TOOL CAN HELP

00:44:58.395 --> 00:45:00.297
COMMUNITIES TRACK EMISSION

00:45:00.364 --> 00:45:01.832
TRENDS FROM FACILITIES

00:45:01.899 --> 00:45:06.336
THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND COMPARE

00:45:06.403 --> 00:45:07.104
THEM WITH EACH OTHER.

00:45:07.171 --> 00:45:08.238
THE FIRST YEAR THAT WE STARTED

00:45:08.305 --> 00:45:09.773
COLLECTING GREENHOUSE DATA WAS

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:10.374
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT SINCE THEN

00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:11.775
SOME FACILITIES HAVE SEEN

00:45:11.842 --> 00:45:13.444
EMISSIONS INCREASES AS

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:15.012
CALIFORNIA GREW OUT OF THE

00:45:15.079 --> 00:45:16.847
RECESSION WHILE OTHERS HAVE SEEN

00:45:16.914 --> 00:45:17.915
REDUCTIONS.

00:45:17.981 --> 00:45:19.183
AND WE'RE LOOKING IN THE STATE

00:45:19.249 --> 00:45:20.918
THAT YOU CAN SEE EMISSIONS VARY

00:45:20.984 --> 00:45:22.953
FROM YEAR TO YEAR FOR INDIVIDUAL

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:24.555
FACILITIES WHICH IS NOT

00:45:24.621 --> 00:45:26.490
SURPRISING BECAUSE THERE ARE

00:45:26.557 --> 00:45:29.059
MANY REASONS ECONOMIC TECHNICAL

00:45:29.126 --> 00:45:31.462
AND REGULATORY THAT INFLUENCE

00:45:31.528 --> 00:45:33.530
AND FACILITIES EMISSIONS IN A

00:45:33.597 --> 00:45:34.598
PARTICULAR YEAR.

00:45:34.665 --> 00:45:36.366
THAT YOU CAN NOTE THAT EMISSIONS

00:45:36.433 --> 00:45:38.202
FROM THE STATION FACILITIES ARE

00:45:38.268 --> 00:45:41.205
SUBJECT TO ENFORCEABLE LIMITS BY

00:45:41.271 --> 00:45:43.073

DISPLAY EMISSIONS FROM VEHICLES

00:45:54.685 --> 00:45:55.819
IN ADDITION TO THE MAJOR

00:45:55.886 --> 00:45:58.655
FACILITIES BY EARLY NEXT YEAR.

00:45:58.722 --> 00:46:00.357
WE HAVE FOUND THAT ONE OF THE

00:46:00.424 --> 00:46:02.326
USES OF THIS TOOL IS TO HELP

00:46:02.392 --> 00:46:04.061

00:46:13.604 --> 00:46:15.539
PRIORITIZE WHERE MORE ACTION IS

00:46:15.606 --> 00:46:16.406
NEEDED.

00:46:16.473 --> 00:46:17.808
WE EXPECT THIS TOOL WILL

00:46:17.875 --> 00:46:19.510
CONTINUE TO BE A VALUABLE

00:46:19.576 --> 00:46:24.348

PROVIDE GREATER TRANSPARENCY

00:46:33.223 --> 00:46:35.726
REGARDING EMISSIONS AS WELL AS

00:46:35.792 --> 00:46:37.094
TO TO DRIVE DOWN EMISSIONS IN

00:46:37.161 --> 00:46:39.930
THOSE AREAS THAT ARE MOST IMPACT.

00:46:39.997 --> 00:46:41.398
IMPACTED.

00:46:41.465 --> 00:46:42.766

00:47:26.476 --> 00:47:27.578
THE BILL RECOGNIZE THAT WHILE

00:47:27.644 --> 00:47:29.346
THE STATE HAS SEEN TREMENDOUS

00:47:29.413 --> 00:47:30.981
IMPROVEMENT IN AIR QUALITY THERE

00:47:31.048 --> 00:47:33.417
ARE COMMUNITIES INCLUDING THOSE

00:47:33.483 --> 00:47:35.185
THAT MAY MENTION THAT ARE NEAR

00:47:35.252 --> 00:47:36.787
FREIGHT FACILITIES.

00:47:36.853 --> 00:47:38.222
AS WELL AS THOSE THAT ARE NEAR

00:47:38.288 --> 00:47:39.556
FREEWAYS THAT REMAIN

00:47:39.623 --> 00:47:41.925
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY

00:47:41.992 --> 00:47:43.327
POOR AIR QUALITY.

00:47:43.393 --> 00:47:45.529
AND THESE COMMUNITIES REQUIRES

00:47:45.596 --> 00:47:48.532
SPECIAL ATTENTION AND ACTION.

00:47:48.599 --> 00:47:51.268
AS CAR MOVES FORWARD WITH AB SIX

00:47:51.335 --> 00:47:52.069
SEVENTEEN IMPROVING THE

00:47:52.135 --> 00:47:53.870
EMISSIONS INVENTORY WILL BE A

00:47:53.937 --> 00:47:56.240
KEY COMPONENT OF ALL OF OUR

00:47:56.306 --> 00:47:57.574
OTHER ACTIVITIES.

00:47:57.641 --> 00:47:59.610
WITH INCREASING FOCUS ON DATA

00:47:59.676 --> 00:48:03.247
QUALITY TIMELINESS ACCESSIBILITY

00:48:03.313 --> 00:48:04.748
AND TRANSPARENCY.

00:48:04.815 --> 00:48:07.584
SO AB ONE NINETY SEVEN AND AB

00:48:07.651 --> 00:48:09.286
SIX SEVENTEEN WORK HAND IN HAND

00:48:09.353 --> 00:48:11.054
TO SUPPORT FOCUSED EMISSIONS

00:48:11.121 --> 00:48:13.457
REDUCTIONS IN OUR MOST IMPACTED

00:48:13.523 --> 00:48:14.791
COMMUNITIES OVER THE COMING

00:48:14.858 --> 00:48:15.692
YEARS.

00:48:15.759 --> 00:48:17.194
THIS IS WHY THIS IS SUCH AN

00:48:17.261 --> 00:48:18.962
IMPORTANT NEW FRAMEWORK FROM

00:48:19.029 --> 00:48:21.064
WHICH ALONG WITH EXISTING LAW

00:48:21.131 --> 00:48:24.001
CAN LOOK AT THE DISPARITIES

00:48:24.067 --> 00:48:27.170
BETWEEN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE

00:48:27.237 --> 00:48:28.505
IMPACTED THESE COMMUNITIES.

00:48:28.572 --> 00:48:29.339
NOW.

00:48:29.406 --> 00:48:30.440
THAT WE'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT

00:48:30.507 --> 00:48:32.576
ABOUT TRANS AND REPORTING IS I'D

00:48:32.643 --> 00:48:33.944
ALSO LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE

00:48:34.011 --> 00:48:35.679
CLIMATE CHANGE PROGRAM AND

00:48:35.746 --> 00:48:38.148
ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE TWENTY

00:48:38.215 --> 00:48:42.619
SEVENTEEN CLIMATE CHANGE SCOPING

00:48:42.686 --> 00:48:42.819
PLAN.

00:48:42.886 --> 00:48:44.288
THE PLAN WAS.

00:48:44.354 --> 00:48:45.222
TO WITH A PUBLIC PROCESS AND

00:48:45.289 --> 00:48:46.456
LEGISLATIVE INPUT OVER TWO AND A

00:48:46.523 --> 00:48:46.957
HALF YEARS THE PLAN WAS

00:48:47.024 --> 00:48:48.992
UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED BY THE BOARD.

00:48:49.059 --> 00:48:50.694
AND THE STAKEHOLDER SUPPORT FOR

00:48:50.761 --> 00:48:52.863
ITS APPROVAL WAS OVERWHELMING.

00:48:52.929 --> 00:48:54.097
WE ARE NOW WORKING ON THE

00:48:54.164 --> 00:48:56.199
STATE'S THIRD SCOPING PLAN AND

00:48:56.266 --> 00:48:57.934
WE'VE MADE GREAT PROGRESS IN

00:48:58.001 --> 00:48:59.136
REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS

00:48:59.202 --> 00:49:01.171
EMISSIONS SINCE ADOPTION OF THE

00:49:01.238 --> 00:49:03.640
FIRST PLAN BACK IN.

00:49:03.707 --> 00:49:04.241
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AGAIN YOUR

00:49:04.308 --> 00:49:06.710
HAND OUTS FOR TODAY SHOW HOW THE

00:49:06.777 --> 00:49:08.812
ECONOMY AND POPULATION.

00:49:08.879 --> 00:49:11.281
CONTINUED TO GROW LAW GHG

00:49:11.348 --> 00:49:13.016
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

00:49:13.083 --> 00:49:15.285
CONTINUE TO DECLINE KEEPING US

00:49:15.352 --> 00:49:18.121
ON TRACK TO MEET THE TWENTY

00:49:18.188 --> 00:49:19.222
TWENTY TARGET.

00:49:19.289 --> 00:49:20.390
IMPORTANTLY WE'RE ON TRACK TO

00:49:20.457 --> 00:49:23.593
MEET OUR A. THIRTY TWO TARGET OF

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:25.862
NINETY REACHING NINETEEN NINETY

00:49:25.929 --> 00:49:27.130
LEVELS BY.

00:49:27.197 --> 00:49:28.498
TWENTY TWENTY I TWENTY SIXTEEN

00:49:28.565 --> 00:49:30.667
LEVELS FELL BELOW THE TWENTY

00:49:30.734 --> 00:49:33.170
TWENTY TARGET FOUR YEARS EARLIER

00:49:33.236 --> 00:49:35.005
THAN MANDATED BY STATUTE.

00:49:35.072 --> 00:49:35.939
AND OF COURSE THAT'S A GOOD

00:49:36.006 --> 00:49:37.974
THING THAT SETS US UP WELL FOR

00:49:38.041 --> 00:49:40.177
THE NEXT DECADE WE WILL NEED

00:49:40.243 --> 00:49:42.579
EVEN STEEPER REDUCTION.

00:49:42.646 --> 00:49:43.947
BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:49:44.014 --> 00:49:46.249
NOTE THAT MANY HAD ASSUMED THAT

00:49:46.316 --> 00:49:49.219
REDUCED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY MUST

00:49:49.286 --> 00:49:51.788
ACCOMPANY REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS.

00:49:51.855 --> 00:49:53.857
BUT OUR EXPERIENCE OVER THE PAST

00:49:53.924 --> 00:49:55.926
FEW YEARS HAS PROVED THAT TO BE

00:49:55.992 --> 00:49:56.860
FALSE.

00:49:56.927 --> 00:49:59.196
CALIFORNIA IS DEMONSTRATING TO

00:49:59.262 --> 00:50:01.298
THE WORLD THAT YOU CAN DE COUPLE

00:50:01.365 --> 00:50:03.200
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND

00:50:03.266 --> 00:50:05.068
ECONOMIC GROWTH WHICH REALLY

00:50:05.135 --> 00:50:08.071
MEANS YOU CAN GROW USING LESS

00:50:08.138 --> 00:50:10.107
ENERGY TO DO IT AB LESS

00:50:10.173 --> 00:50:11.274
POLLUTION.

00:50:11.341 --> 00:50:12.809
THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN SCOPING

00:50:12.876 --> 00:50:14.845
PLAN CONTINUES THIS APPROACH

00:50:14.911 --> 00:50:16.813
USING A MIX OF REGULATIONS

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:19.783
INCENTIVES AS WELL AS THE MARKET

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:21.284
BASED MECHANISM.

00:50:21.351 --> 00:50:23.153
THAT PUTS A CAP ON EMISSIONS AND

00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:25.489
ALLOWS FOR ALLOWANCE TRADING TO

00:50:25.555 --> 00:50:28.792
ACHIEVE OUR TWENTY THIRTY TARGET.

00:50:28.859 --> 00:50:30.527
USING A COMPREHENSIVE MIX OF

00:50:30.594 --> 00:50:32.529
STRATEGIES AS DESCRIBED IN THE

00:50:32.596 --> 00:50:33.730
SCOPING PLAN.

00:50:33.797 --> 00:50:38.435
BUILD ON OUR SUCCESS OVER THE

00:50:38.502 --> 00:50:38.769
LAST DECADE.

00:50:38.835 --> 00:50:39.269
IN ADDITION TO REDUCING

00:50:39.336 --> 00:50:40.504
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SEVERAL

00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:41.805
STRATEGY THE SCOPING PLAN WERE

00:50:41.872 --> 00:50:43.340
DEVELOPED AS PART OF THE STATE'S

00:50:43.407 --> 00:50:44.808
EFFORTS TO MEET FEDERAL AIR

00:50:44.875 --> 00:50:47.210
QUALITY STANDARDS IN OUR STATE

00:50:47.277 --> 00:50:48.745
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN.

00:50:48.812 --> 00:50:50.680
AND TO REDUCE TOXICS EMISSIONS

00:50:50.747 --> 00:50:51.782
IN THE SUSTAINABLE FREIGHT

00:50:51.848 --> 00:50:54.484
STRATEGY SO WE'RE REALLY TALKING

00:50:54.551 --> 00:50:56.086
ABOUT TRIPLE THREAT.

00:50:56.153 --> 00:50:58.021
STRATEGY INCLUDES PROGRAMS SUCH

00:50:58.088 --> 00:50:59.723
AS THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD

00:50:59.790 --> 00:51:01.725
AND RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD

00:51:01.792 --> 00:51:03.326
THAT ARE DELIVERING CLEANER

00:51:03.393 --> 00:51:04.661
FUELS AND ENERGY.

00:51:04.728 --> 00:51:06.463
THE ADVANCE CLEAN CARS PROGRAM

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:07.330
WHICH IS PUT MORE THAN A QUARTER

00:51:07.397 --> 00:51:09.266
MILLION CLEAN VEHICLES ON THE

00:51:09.332 --> 00:51:09.866
ROAD.

00:51:09.933 --> 00:51:11.401
AND THE SUSTAINABLE FREIGHT

00:51:11.468 --> 00:51:13.537
ACTION PLAN WHICH WILL RESULT IN

00:51:13.603 --> 00:51:15.705
EFFICIENT AND CLEANER SYSTEMS TO

00:51:15.772 --> 00:51:18.141
MOVE GOODS THROUGHOUT THE STATES.

00:51:18.208 --> 00:51:19.643
WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT A CAP AND

00:51:19.709 --> 00:51:22.479
TRADE PROGRAM AS A PART OF THE

00:51:22.546 --> 00:51:24.014
PACKAGE WITH OTHER MEASURES.

00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:26.116
IS ESSENTIAL BECAUSE IT ALLOWS

00:51:26.183 --> 00:51:27.451
US TO MEET OUR GOALS WHILE

00:51:27.517 --> 00:51:29.686
SIMULTANEOUSLY ACHIEVING THE CO

00:51:29.753 --> 00:51:32.122
BENEFIT OF IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH

00:51:32.189 --> 00:51:34.357
AS A RESULT OF DIRECT INVESTMENT

00:51:34.424 --> 00:51:35.025
OF DOLLARS.

00:51:35.091 --> 00:51:37.627
IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND

00:51:37.694 --> 00:51:39.329
UNDERSCORES CALIFORNIA'S

00:51:39.396 --> 00:51:40.931

00:51:40.997 --> 00:51:44.334
INTERNATIONAL LEADERSHIP ON

00:51:44.401 --> 00:51:45.235
CLIMATE.

00:51:45.302 --> 00:51:45.702
AGAIN ON THE ISSUE OF

00:51:45.769 --> 00:51:47.003
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WE

00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:49.139
NEED TO NOTE THAT OF THE THREE

00:51:49.206 --> 00:51:51.942
POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS.

00:51:52.008 --> 00:51:56.513
ASKED SPENT AS OF DECEMBER

00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:58.982
201857% HAS BEEN SPENT IN WAYS

00:51:59.049 --> 00:52:00.484
THAT WERE DESIGNED TO DIRECTLY

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:01.618
BENEFIT.

00:52:01.685 --> 00:52:03.487
DISADVANTAGED AND LOW INCOME

00:52:03.553 --> 00:52:05.822
COMMUNITIES SO SLIGHTLY MORE

00:52:05.889 --> 00:52:07.123
THAN HALF.

00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:09.526
SINCE THE ADOPTION OF THE TWENTY

00:52:09.593 --> 00:52:10.527
SEVENTEEN SCOPING PLAN WE'VE

00:52:10.594 --> 00:52:12.496
MODIFIED AN ADOPTED SEVERAL OF

00:52:12.562 --> 00:52:14.231
OUR PLANS AND REGULATIONS. TO

ASSURE THE EARLY AND LONG TERM

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:19.069
CERTAINTY FOR BUSINESSES TO PLAN

00:52:19.135 --> 00:52:20.904
AND INVESTED IN EMISSIONS

00:52:20.971 --> 00:52:22.239
REDUCTIONS AFFECTS.

00:52:22.305 --> 00:52:24.908
IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN CAR VOTED TO

00:52:24.975 --> 00:52:26.209
SET GREENHOUSE GAS PLANNING

00:52:26.276 --> 00:52:27.777
TARGETS FOR THE ELECTRICITY

00:52:27.844 --> 00:52:30.013
SECTOR AND UTILITIES AND

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:31.314
SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES.

00:52:31.381 --> 00:52:32.816
WE VOTED TO STRENGTHEN AND

00:52:32.883 --> 00:52:34.784
EXPAND OUR REGULATIONS FOR

00:52:34.851 --> 00:52:37.087
VEHICLES CLEAN FEELS AS WELL AS

00:52:37.153 --> 00:52:38.321
THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM.

00:52:38.388 --> 00:52:39.723
AND HER SHORT LIVED CLIMATE

00:52:39.789 --> 00:52:42.325
POLLUTANTS SUCH AS METHANE WE'VE

00:52:42.392 --> 00:52:44.427
ADOPTED NEW REQUIREMENTS FOR

00:52:44.494 --> 00:52:46.329
HIGH GLOBAL WARMING GASES THAT

00:52:46.396 --> 00:52:48.298
ARE USED IN REFRIGERATION AND

00:52:48.365 --> 00:52:49.399
FOAM.

00:52:49.466 --> 00:52:51.701
SO WITH ALL OF THESE PLANS AND

00:52:51.768 --> 00:52:53.937
REGULATIONS WE NEED TO MONITOR

00:52:54.004 --> 00:52:55.305
AND TO CONTINUE TO HAVE

00:52:55.372 --> 00:52:57.340
DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU THE

00:52:59.175 --> 00:53:01.011
STAKEHOLDERS. TO SEE HOW IS

00:53:01.077 --> 00:53:03.213
ACTUALLY WORKING IN ADDITION TO

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.781
THE DATA THAT WE COLLECT TO

COLLECT REAL WORLD INFORMATION

00:53:06.716 --> 00:53:07.584
ABOUT.

00:53:07.651 --> 00:53:09.386
NOT ONLY HOW WE'RE DOING BUT HOW

00:53:09.452 --> 00:53:10.887
WE COULD BE DOING BETTER NOW WE

00:53:10.954 --> 00:53:14.391
COULD MAKE CORRECTIONS MIDWAY AS

00:53:14.457 --> 00:53:16.793
NEEDED. ONE MAJOR DEVELOPMENT

00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:18.161
THAT WILL SUPPORT AYE MANDATES

00:53:18.228 --> 00:53:20.564
UNDER AB EIGHT ONE NINETY SEVEN

00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:22.232
IS THE DEVELOP A DEVELOPMENT OF

NEW STATEWIDE STATIONARY SOURCE.

00:53:24.401 --> 00:53:27.037
EMISSIONS A NEW EMISSIONS

00:53:27.103 --> 00:53:28.271
REPORTING REGULATIONS THEY'VE

00:53:28.338 --> 00:53:30.040
WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH LOCAL

00:53:30.106 --> 00:53:31.775
AIR DISTRICTS INDUSTRY GROUPS

00:53:31.841 --> 00:53:33.109
AND PUBLIC HEALTH GROUPS OVER

00:53:33.176 --> 00:53:35.078
THE PAST YEAR. TO DEVELOP THIS

00:53:35.145 --> 00:53:37.113
REGULATION WHICH IS NOW IN THE

00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:39.449
PROCESS OF BEING FINALIZED.

00:53:39.516 --> 00:53:41.251
IN DECEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEENTH

00:53:41.318 --> 00:53:42.819
THE CARDBOARD ALSO APPROVED THE

00:53:42.886 --> 00:53:44.721
REGULATION FOR REPORTING OF

00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:48.124
CONTAMINANTS.

00:53:48.191 --> 00:53:50.493
THIS REGULATION REQUIRES ANNUAL

00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:51.628
REPORTING TO KERR.

00:53:51.695 --> 00:53:54.264

FROM SPECIFIED FACILITIES AND I

00:53:58.168 --> 00:53:59.536
REALIZE THIS MAY SOUND LIKE IT'S

00:53:59.603 --> 00:54:01.738
OBVIOUS BUT YOU HAVE TO REALIZE

00:54:01.805 --> 00:54:03.607
THAT THERE IS NO PLACE ELSE THAT

00:54:03.673 --> 00:54:05.875
WE ARE AWARE OF WHERE YOU CAN

00:54:05.942 --> 00:54:08.011
TAKE A PARTICULAR FACILITY.

00:54:08.078 --> 00:54:11.214

00:54:14.985 --> 00:54:17.320
SEPARATE PROGRAMS FOR MANY MANY

00:54:17.387 --> 00:54:19.289
YEARS BUT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS

00:54:19.356 --> 00:54:20.790
REALLY COLLECTING.

00:54:20.857 --> 00:54:22.926
THE DATA AND LOOKING AT IT IN A

00:54:22.993 --> 00:54:25.729
MORE COHERENT AND COMPREHENSIVE

00:54:25.795 --> 00:54:26.496
WAY WHICH WE THINK WILL ALSO

00:54:26.563 --> 00:54:27.464
HELP US.

00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:30.100
DEVELOP BETTER AT SOLUTIONS TO

00:54:30.166 --> 00:54:33.503
HOW TO BRING EMISSIONS DOWN EVEN

00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:34.537
FURTHER.

00:54:34.604 --> 00:54:36.940
SO -- THIS REGULATION --

00:54:37.007 --> 00:54:38.908
OBVIOUSLY WAS DESIGNED -- TO

00:54:38.975 --> 00:54:40.243
ADDRESS THE LEGISLATIVE

00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:42.445
REQUIREMENT BUT AGAIN IT ALSO

00:54:42.512 --> 00:54:44.280
SUPPORTS THE CARBS NEEDS FOR A

00:54:44.347 --> 00:54:46.182
BETTER INVENTORY TO USE FOR

00:54:46.249 --> 00:54:49.219
OTHER PURPOSES AS WELL AND MANY

00:54:49.285 --> 00:54:50.954
OTHER PROGRAMS COULD BENEFIT

00:54:51.021 --> 00:54:52.222
FROM MORE.

00:54:52.288 --> 00:54:53.823
COMPREHENSIVE AND UPDATED

00:54:53.890 --> 00:54:56.326
EMISSIONS INVENTORIES AS WELL.

00:54:56.393 --> 00:54:58.528
THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDING OUR AIR

00:54:58.595 --> 00:55:00.630
TOXIC CONTROL MEASURES IN THE

00:55:00.697 --> 00:55:02.699
STATE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN LAYOUT

00:55:02.766 --> 00:55:04.000
PROCESS SEES TO ADDRESS

00:55:04.067 --> 00:55:06.603
MITIGATION IN AREAS THAT EXCEED

00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:08.471
THE FEDERAL STATE FEDERAL AND

00:55:08.538 --> 00:55:10.006
STATE AIR QUALITY STANDARDS.

00:55:10.073 --> 00:55:11.174
AND THE PUBLIC RIGHT TO KNOW

00:55:11.241 --> 00:55:14.177
TENANTS OF AB ONE NINETY SEVEN

00:55:14.244 --> 00:55:15.845
INCLUDING A REQUIREMENT TO

00:55:15.912 --> 00:55:17.313
PROVIDE EMISSIONS INVENTORY ON

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:19.382
STATIONARY SOURCES AT THE LOCAL

00:55:19.449 --> 00:55:21.785
AND SUB COUNTY LEVEL ON OUR

00:55:21.851 --> 00:55:22.919
WEBSITE.

00:55:22.986 --> 00:55:25.121
SO THE REGULATION IS GOING TO

00:55:25.188 --> 00:55:28.191
REQUIRE -- MAJOR ACT ACTIVITY

00:55:28.258 --> 00:55:30.360
MAJOR EFFORT BUT IT IS WORTH IT

00:55:30.427 --> 00:55:31.928
IN TERMS OF WHAT IT WILL ALLOW

00:55:31.995 --> 00:55:34.597
US TO DO -- GOING FORWARD.

00:55:34.664 --> 00:55:36.533
SO -- I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT

00:55:36.599 --> 00:55:39.269
REALLY THE BIGGEST STRATEGIES --

00:55:39.335 --> 00:55:40.437
IN THE TRY TO WIND UP HERE

00:55:40.503 --> 00:55:41.671
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU WANT TO HEAR

00:55:41.738 --> 00:55:43.440
FROM OTHER PEOPLE AND PRESUMABLY

00:55:43.506 --> 00:55:45.375
ALL HAVE QUESTIONS AS WELL.

00:55:45.442 --> 00:55:47.777
BUT TO LOOK AT THE OVERALL

00:55:47.844 --> 00:55:49.312
ISSUES OF AIR QUALITY AND

00:55:49.379 --> 00:55:51.281
CLIMATE THERE IMPACTS THROUGHOUT

00:55:51.347 --> 00:55:52.849
THE STATE AND IN THE

00:55:52.916 --> 00:55:54.184
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES.

00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:55.885
THE SECTOR THAT STANDS OUT AS

00:55:55.952 --> 00:55:58.154
OUR BIGGEST SOURCE OF EMISSIONS

00:55:58.221 --> 00:56:00.090
OVERWHELMING ALL OTHERS IS

00:56:00.156 --> 00:56:01.291
TRANSPORTATION.

00:56:01.357 --> 00:56:03.693
IT ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT HALF OF

00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:04.961
ALL OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS

00:56:05.028 --> 00:56:08.364
EMISSIONS AND 90% OF THE HOT

00:56:08.431 --> 00:56:09.799
TOXIC DIESEL PARTICULATE

00:56:09.866 --> 00:56:11.234
EMISSIONS.

00:56:11.301 --> 00:56:12.602
AND THE LARGEST EMISSIONS

00:56:12.669 --> 00:56:15.038
SOURCES INCLUDING TRUCKS TRAINS

00:56:15.105 --> 00:56:18.441
AND SHIPS ARE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO

00:56:18.508 --> 00:56:21.010
BE CONTROLLED IF WE'RE GOING TO

00:56:21.077 --> 00:56:24.280
MEET OUR REDUCTION GOALS.

00:56:24.347 --> 00:56:26.816
WE HAVE TO TAKE IN OUR OVERALL

00:56:26.883 --> 00:56:28.084
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM.

00:56:28.151 --> 00:56:29.586
OUR APPROACH TO REDUCING

00:56:29.652 --> 00:56:30.820
EMISSIONS IN THIS SECTOR

00:56:30.887 --> 00:56:36.593
INCLUDES NEW TECHNOLOGIES FUELS

00:56:36.659 --> 00:56:38.328
AS WELL AS SPENDING.

00:56:38.394 --> 00:56:40.163
DOLLARS -- TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES --

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:42.132
FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF CLEANER --

00:56:42.198 --> 00:56:44.567
TECHNOLOGIES AND ALSO INCLUDES

00:56:44.634 --> 00:56:47.237
SUSTAINABLE IMPROVEMENTS IS IN

00:56:47.303 --> 00:56:48.705
SUSTAINABLE LAND USE PLANNING

00:56:48.772 --> 00:56:51.174
BUT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR

00:56:51.241 --> 00:56:53.109
SUCCESS IN THE SECTOR DEPENDS ON

00:56:53.176 --> 00:56:56.212
SUPPORT FROM THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

00:56:56.279 --> 00:56:57.947
I THINK AS YOU ALL KNOW THE

00:56:58.014 --> 00:56:59.349
CURRENT ADMINISTRATION IN

00:56:59.415 --> 00:57:01.985
WASHINGTON DC IS IN THE BUSINESS

00:57:02.051 --> 00:57:04.120
OF DISMANTLING THE FEDERAL

00:57:04.187 --> 00:57:05.989
RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND

00:57:06.055 --> 00:57:07.023
CLEAN AIR.

00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:08.758
BETWEEN DISBANDING THE FEDERAL

00:57:08.825 --> 00:57:11.161
CLIMATE ADVISORY PANEL.

00:57:11.227 --> 00:57:13.596
RESCINDING THE CLEAN POWER PLAN

00:57:13.663 --> 00:57:15.765
COURT ACTIONS TO ROLL BACK

00:57:15.832 --> 00:57:17.734
FEDERAL LAWS AND POTENT SHORT

00:57:17.801 --> 00:57:18.768
LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS

00:57:18.835 --> 00:57:20.904
REDUCTION STRATEGIES AS WELL AS

00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:22.205
WITHDRAWING FROM.

00:57:22.272 --> 00:57:24.908
OUR INTERNATIONAL CLIMATE

00:57:24.974 --> 00:57:25.708
AGREEMENT.

00:57:25.775 --> 00:57:28.077
EVERY MONTH BRINGS ANOTHER

00:57:28.144 --> 00:57:31.681
ALARMING ROLL BACK OF FEDERAL

00:57:31.748 --> 00:57:32.949
POLICIES THAT HAVE.

00:57:33.016 --> 00:57:34.551
PROVIDED THE UNDER GIRDING FOR

00:57:34.617 --> 00:57:36.219
OUR PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIVITIES AT

00:57:36.286 --> 00:57:38.121
THE STATE LEVEL FOR ALL THESE

00:57:38.188 --> 00:57:38.721
YEARS.

00:57:38.788 --> 00:57:41.825
CALIFORNIA THEREFORE IS LOOKED

00:57:41.891 --> 00:57:43.259
TO BY OTHERS AS WELL AS

00:57:43.326 --> 00:57:45.495
OURSELVES -- TO CONTINUE TO LEAD

00:57:45.562 --> 00:57:47.697
THE WAY NOT ONLY AS A LIVING

00:57:47.764 --> 00:57:49.933
EXAMPLE OF HOW TO REDUCE

00:57:49.999 --> 00:57:52.836
EMISSIONS WHILE CONTINUING TO

00:57:52.902 --> 00:57:55.171
GROW A THRIVING ECONOMY BUT ALSO

00:57:55.238 --> 00:57:57.540
TO PROVIDE THE IMPETUS FOR NEW

00:57:57.607 --> 00:57:58.908
TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION.

00:57:58.975 --> 00:58:01.444
THE STATE HAS TO LOOK FORWARD I

00:58:01.511 --> 00:58:03.713
HAD OF ANY PARTICULAR ELECTION

00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:05.481
CYCLE AND ANY PARTICULAR

00:58:05.548 --> 00:58:08.151
ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON AND

00:58:08.218 --> 00:58:11.020
THE HERE AS A STEADY SOURCE.

00:58:11.087 --> 00:58:13.823
OF GUIDANCE INTO THE FUTURE.

00:58:13.890 --> 00:58:15.825
HOWEVER WE ARE -- CLEARLY

00:58:15.892 --> 00:58:18.061
RECOGNIZING THE DANGER FROM

00:58:18.127 --> 00:58:21.664
WHAT'S GOING ON IN WASHINGTON.

00:58:21.731 --> 00:58:24.167
AND IT'S A THREAT NOW DIRECTLY

00:58:24.234 --> 00:58:26.703
TO ATTACK THE STATE'S ABILITY TO

00:58:26.769 --> 00:58:28.204
ADOPT MORE STRINGENT.

00:58:28.271 --> 00:58:30.106
STANDARDS PARTICULARLY WHEN IT

00:58:30.173 --> 00:58:32.075
COMES TO THE WAIVERS THAT WE'VE

00:58:32.141 --> 00:58:33.877
ENJOYED FOR STRICTER CAR

00:58:33.943 --> 00:58:37.814
STANDARDS UNDER THE CLEAN AIR

00:58:37.881 --> 00:58:38.147
ACT.

00:58:38.214 --> 00:58:40.049
IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OUR WAIVERS --

00:58:40.116 --> 00:58:42.318
OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE LITIGATED

00:58:42.385 --> 00:58:45.421
WE HAVE ADVOCATED WE HAVE HAD

00:58:45.488 --> 00:58:47.557
GOVERNOR'S VISIT WASHINGTON

00:58:47.624 --> 00:58:49.525
EVERY TIME THERE WAS A THREAT --

00:58:49.592 --> 00:58:52.161
BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE

00:58:52.228 --> 00:58:53.429
HAVE BEEN.

00:58:53.496 --> 00:58:54.998
IN A SITUATION WHERE WE'VE BEEN

00:58:55.064 --> 00:58:57.300
TOLD THAT A WAIVER WHICH HAS

00:58:57.367 --> 00:58:59.168
ALREADY BEEN GRANTED FOR

00:58:59.235 --> 00:59:01.137
ADOPTING THAT PAVLEY STANDARDS

00:59:01.204 --> 00:59:02.672
THAT DEAL WITH GREENHOUSE GAS

00:59:02.739 --> 00:59:03.840
EMISSIONS.

00:59:03.907 --> 00:59:06.309
WAS GOING TO BE -- ACTUALLY WITH

00:59:06.376 --> 00:59:08.378
TO DRAW ON AND SO WE'RE WORKING

00:59:08.444 --> 00:59:10.480
VERY HARD AND HAPPY TO SAY THAT

00:59:10.546 --> 00:59:12.582
WE'VE BEEN JOINED NOW BY TWENTY

00:59:12.649 --> 00:59:14.751
THREE OTHER STATES AND HAWAII

00:59:14.817 --> 00:59:17.620
AND I'M AND TO PUT A RICO -- AS

00:59:17.687 --> 00:59:21.691
A ADVOCATES -- FOR FOR US

00:59:21.758 --> 00:59:24.360
BLOCKING THIS ACTION AT NOT TO

00:59:24.427 --> 00:59:26.729
MENTION MANY -- BUSINESS

00:59:26.796 --> 00:59:30.466
ORGANIZATIONS AND NGOS AS WELL.

00:59:30.533 --> 00:59:33.303
WHILE WE'RE TRYING TO FIND A WAY

00:59:33.369 --> 00:59:34.304
TO WORK PRODUCTIVELY WITH THE

00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:36.372
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHEN IT COMES

00:59:36.439 --> 00:59:37.707
TO CALIFORNIA'S VEHICLE EMISSION

00:59:37.774 --> 00:59:39.776
STANDARDS WE ARE BEING ATTACKED

00:59:39.842 --> 00:59:42.845
AT THE VERY HEART OF OUR PROGRAM.

00:59:42.912 --> 00:59:44.580
IF WE WERE TO LOSE THE ABILITY

00:59:44.647 --> 00:59:46.082
TO SET EMISSION STANDARDS WE

00:59:46.149 --> 00:59:48.751
WOULD CERTAINLY FIGHT VIGOROUSLY

00:59:48.818 --> 00:59:50.586
AND AT THE END WE WOULD FIND A

00:59:50.653 --> 00:59:53.456
WAY IS -- TO CONTINUE TO ACHIEVE

00:59:53.523 --> 00:59:55.825
REDUCTIONS BUT THERE'S NOTHING

00:59:55.892 --> 00:59:58.328
THAT IS AS EFFICIENT AND COST

00:59:58.394 --> 01:00:00.964
EFFECTIVE AS OUR AS WE HAVE

01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:02.799
FOUND -- IN IN ADVANCING

01:00:02.865 --> 01:00:05.601
TECHNOLOGY FOR CONTROLLING MOTOR

01:00:05.668 --> 01:00:07.904
VEHICLE EMISSIONS SO -- OUR

01:00:07.971 --> 01:00:09.339
ABILITY TO REDUCE THESE

01:00:09.405 --> 01:00:12.041
EMISSIONS -- IS REALLY IN THE

01:00:12.108 --> 01:00:15.678
BALANCE AND COULD BE IMPAIRED --

01:00:15.745 --> 01:00:21.484
pWOULD LIKE -- TO VITE YOUR

01:00:21.551 --> 01:00:23.720
QUESTIONS AND TALK ABOUT HOW WE

01:00:23.786 --> 01:00:26.823
CAN CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER --

01:00:26.889 --> 01:00:27.890
TO BUILD ON THE COULD WORK

01:00:27.957 --> 01:00:29.926
THAT'S BEEN DONE OVER MANY YEARS

01:00:29.993 --> 01:00:32.929
AND AND TO MOVE ON TO A EVEN

01:00:32.996 --> 01:00:34.030
BETTER DAYS.

01:00:34.097 --> 01:00:40.036
THANK YOU THANK YOU AND SO I DO

01:00:40.103 --> 01:00:42.105
YOU WANT TO ADD A KNOWLEDGE THAT --

01:00:42.171 --> 01:00:43.106
WHEN AB?

01:00:43.172 --> 01:00:43.973
ONE MAYBE SEVEN WAS PASSED WE

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:45.041
WERE PLAYING MORE OFFENSE UNLESS

01:00:45.108 --> 01:00:46.342
DEFENSE I AND SO I AM AWARE NOT

01:00:46.409 --> 01:00:47.710
JUST IN THIS BUT JUST IN GENERAL

01:00:47.777 --> 01:00:48.778
FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT

01:00:48.845 --> 01:00:50.480
A LOT OF OUR ENERGIES.

01:00:50.546 --> 01:00:52.615
ARE GOING TOWARDS A DEFENSE

01:00:52.682 --> 01:00:54.050
RIGHT NOW WHETHER IT'S THE

01:00:54.117 --> 01:00:56.919
CALIFORNIA EMISSION STANDARDS OR

01:00:56.986 --> 01:00:58.588
A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS THAT WE

01:00:58.654 --> 01:01:00.957
HAVE BEEN UNDER ATTACK ON THE

01:01:01.024 --> 01:01:01.858
ENVIRONMENT A LOT OF OTHER

01:01:01.924 --> 01:01:03.393
THINGS AND SO I KNOW THAT.

01:01:03.459 --> 01:01:06.696
OUR ENERGIES ARE PRETTY TAX AND

01:01:06.763 --> 01:01:08.064
AND PRETTY SPLIT RIGHT NOW.

01:01:08.131 --> 01:01:08.898
WITH THAT BUT I DID WANT TO

01:01:08.965 --> 01:01:11.067

01:01:18.775 --> 01:01:20.176
HELP MOTIVATE.

01:01:20.243 --> 01:01:23.212

ALONG THE WAY ABOUT WHETHER OR

01:01:31.354 --> 01:01:33.656

AT MOVING TOWARDS OUR TWENTY

01:01:39.195 --> 01:01:39.896
THIRTY GOALS.

01:01:39.962 --> 01:01:41.798
SO WE DID HIT THE TWENTY TWENTY

01:01:41.864 --> 01:01:44.767
GOAL IN TWENTY SIXTEEN BUT OF

01:01:44.834 --> 01:01:47.737
COURSE -- ONE YEAR ADD DATA

01:01:47.804 --> 01:01:51.174
DOESN'T NECESSARILY HOLD INTO

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:53.709
THE FUTURE -- WE HAVE TO LOOK AT

01:01:53.776 --> 01:01:55.044
THE ECONOMIC TRENDS AS I

01:01:55.111 --> 01:01:56.479
MENTIONED BUT ALSO WEATHER

01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:58.848
CONDITIONS AND OTHER THINGS THAT

01:01:58.915 --> 01:02:00.983
MIGHT AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO

01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:02.418
MAINTAIN THE PROGRESS THAT WE

01:02:02.485 --> 01:02:04.887
STARTED -- I THINK IN TERMS OF

01:02:04.954 --> 01:02:07.323
MOVING TOWARDS TWENTY THIRTY WE

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:08.591
BELIEVE THAT WE'RE IN PRETTY

01:02:08.658 --> 01:02:10.927
GOOD SHAPE WITH A MIX OF TOOLS.

01:02:10.993 --> 01:02:13.029
THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO US

01:02:13.096 --> 01:02:17.133
TODAY -- WE'RE DOING WELL ON A

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:19.268
RAPID DEPLOYMENT OF ZERO

01:02:19.335 --> 01:02:21.804
EMISSION VEHICLES WERE SEEING --

01:02:21.871 --> 01:02:24.507
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TAKING

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:27.977
INITIATIVES ON THE LAND USE FROM

01:02:28.044 --> 01:02:31.314
TO TRY -- TO USE THEIR RESOURCES

01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:34.183
MORE EFFICIENTLY AND TO HELP

01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:36.953
WITH -- USING -- SOME OF THE

01:02:37.019 --> 01:02:39.422
RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE --

01:02:39.489 --> 01:02:40.690
THROUGH THE GREENHOUSE GAS

01:02:40.756 --> 01:02:42.325
PRODUCTION FUND TO BUILD MORE

01:02:42.391 --> 01:02:44.694
LIVABLE COMMUNITIES EXPAND

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:46.529
TRANSIT AND WALKING AND BIKING

01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:50.166
OPPORTUNITIES -- WE ARE TAKING A

01:02:50.233 --> 01:02:52.635
WHOLE NEW LOOK AT INDUSTRIAL

01:02:52.702 --> 01:02:55.571
FACILITIES AND WHAT CAN BE DONE --

01:02:55.638 --> 01:02:57.773
LOOKING AT BUILDINGS WHERE WE

01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:59.942
HAVE DONE A LOT IN CALIFORNIA TO

01:03:00.009 --> 01:03:01.844
MAKE THEM EFFICIENT BUT WE STILL --

01:03:01.911 --> 01:03:04.580
BURN A LOT OF NATURAL GAS AND

01:03:04.647 --> 01:03:12.288
HEATING WATER AND HEATING

01:03:12.355 --> 01:03:12.889
BUILDINGS AND THAT IS A BIG

01:03:12.955 --> 01:03:13.956
SOURCE OF INDOOR AIR POLLUTION

01:03:14.023 --> 01:03:15.158
AS WELL AS OF GREENHOUSE GAS

01:03:15.224 --> 01:03:16.859
EMISSIONS -- WE'RE LOOKING AT TO

01:03:16.926 --> 01:03:19.896
AGRICULTURE WHICH HAS -- HAS

01:03:19.962 --> 01:03:22.064
BEEN OVER THE YEARS A MAJOR

01:03:22.131 --> 01:03:23.432
SOURCE OF SHORT LIVED CLIMATE

01:03:23.499 --> 01:03:26.702
POLLUTANTS TO SEE WHERE WE CAN --

01:03:26.769 --> 01:03:29.539
FIND WAYS TO MAKE SOME BIG GAINS

01:03:29.605 --> 01:03:32.642
THERE IN TERMS OF EFFICIENCY AND

01:03:32.708 --> 01:03:34.710
ALSO IMPROVE AIR QUALITY AT THE

01:03:34.777 --> 01:03:37.613
SAME TIME SO CAR IS BEEN GOING

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:40.216
SORT OF SECTOR BY SECTOR --

01:03:40.283 --> 01:03:42.451
LOOKING AROUND TO SEE WHERE WE

01:03:42.518 --> 01:03:44.387
CAN TIGHTEN THINGS UP AND WHERE

01:03:44.453 --> 01:03:47.857
WE CAN DO BETTER -- BUT OVERALL

01:03:47.924 --> 01:03:50.927
I THINK THROUGH TWENTY THIRTY WE

01:03:50.993 --> 01:03:52.528
BELIEVE THAT THE TOOLS THAT WE

01:03:52.595 --> 01:03:55.198
NEED ARE AVAILABLE IT'S WHEN WE

01:03:55.264 --> 01:03:58.301
LOOK TOWARDS TWENTY FIFTY M. OUR

01:03:58.367 --> 01:04:01.037
GOAL OF BECOMING -- CARBON

01:04:01.103 --> 01:04:03.940
NEUTRAL OR AND THAT IS NOT

01:04:04.006 --> 01:04:06.542
ADMITTING ANYTHING THAT WE SEE

01:04:06.609 --> 01:04:09.612
THE AREAS WHERE WE FRANKLY DON'T

01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:11.180
KNOW YET HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET

01:04:11.247 --> 01:04:11.847
THERE.

01:04:11.914 --> 01:04:13.449
WE KNOW WE'VE GOT TO DO A LOT

01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:17.220
MORE TO MAKE OUR FORESTS -- AND

01:04:17.286 --> 01:04:20.323
OUR LAND -- STORE MORE CARBON

01:04:20.389 --> 01:04:22.992
EFFECTIVELY AND BECOME A NET

01:04:23.059 --> 01:04:26.929
SINK INSTEAD OF A SOURCE OF

01:04:26.996 --> 01:04:28.197
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.

01:04:28.264 --> 01:04:30.333
WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO CAPTURE

01:04:30.399 --> 01:04:35.104
CARBON LITERALLY IN THE AIR AND

01:04:35.171 --> 01:04:36.872
TO FIND WAYS.

01:04:36.939 --> 01:04:38.474
TO RE USE IT FOR BENEFICIAL

01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:41.477
PURPOSES OR PERMANENTLY --

01:04:41.544 --> 01:04:42.945
NEUTRALIZE IT THERE ARE

01:04:43.012 --> 01:04:44.447
TECHNOLOGIES OUT THERE THAT ARE

01:04:44.513 --> 01:04:46.115
BEING DEVELOPED THAT ARE BEING

01:04:46.182 --> 01:04:49.185
WORKED ON BUT WE DON'T YET HAVE

01:04:49.252 --> 01:04:51.687
THE PLANS IN PLACE AND THE TOOLS.

01:04:51.754 --> 01:04:52.688
TO MAKE ALL OF THOSE THINGS

01:04:52.755 --> 01:04:54.257
HAPPEN AND WE WILL NEED TO

01:04:54.323 --> 01:04:57.793
CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO AB

01:04:57.860 --> 01:04:59.562
ADVANCE THE SCIENCE AND

01:04:59.629 --> 01:05:04.500
TECHNOLOGY AND IN A NUMBER OF

01:05:04.567 --> 01:05:06.235
THESE AREAS.

01:05:06.302 --> 01:05:09.105
SO THEN WHEN -- THERE IS THERE'S

01:05:09.171 --> 01:05:11.474
A A QUOTE WERE YOU PREVIOUSLY

01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:12.441
SAID THAT.

01:05:12.508 --> 01:05:14.210
THE STRATEGIES WE USE UNTIL NOW

01:05:14.277 --> 01:05:15.278
HAVEN'T BEEN EFFECTIVE THAN THIS

01:05:15.344 --> 01:05:16.379
WOULD FALL INTO WE'RE TALKING

01:05:16.445 --> 01:05:17.580
ABOUT THAT WE WERE TRANSFERRED

01:05:17.647 --> 01:05:19.582
OUT WITH THOSE TOOLS WOULD BE

01:05:19.649 --> 01:05:21.984
MOVING FORWARD -- SO THAT WOULD

01:05:22.051 --> 01:05:23.119
BE A FIRM TO PETITION.

01:05:23.185 --> 01:05:25.154
YES I MEAN I THINK THAT THINGS

01:05:25.221 --> 01:05:27.456
LIKE THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM

01:05:27.523 --> 01:05:28.291
FOR EXAMPLE.

01:05:28.357 --> 01:05:30.593
KIND OF SETTLED IN AS PART OF

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:33.029
EXPECTATIONS THAT THE PUBLIC HAS

01:05:33.095 --> 01:05:34.563
AND THAT THE REGULATED INDUSTRY

01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:35.998
HAS THAT THOSE WILL CONTINUE TO

01:05:36.065 --> 01:05:38.834
EXIST AND THAT WILL CONTINUE --

01:05:38.901 --> 01:05:42.171
TO RATCHET DOWN ON THE ON THE AD

01:05:42.238 --> 01:05:44.307
LIMITS THAT US FACILITIES CAN

01:05:44.373 --> 01:05:46.976
CAN HAVE -- AND THAT PEOPLE ARE

01:05:47.043 --> 01:05:49.345
FINDING WAYS NOW INTERNALLY

01:05:49.412 --> 01:05:51.947
WITHIN THEIR FACILITIES TO

01:05:52.014 --> 01:05:54.517
REDUCE THEIR EMISSIONS AND THIS

01:05:54.583 --> 01:05:56.185
IS REALLY WHAT THE WHAT THE

01:05:56.252 --> 01:05:59.288
PROGRAM IS INTENDED. TO

01:05:59.355 --> 01:06:00.990
ACCOMPLISH.

01:06:01.057 --> 01:06:04.393
SO WE KNOW THAT.

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:06.896
BOTH DATA AND ON MY ANECDOTAL

01:06:06.962 --> 01:06:08.831
EXPERIENCE GOING HOME EVERY

01:06:08.898 --> 01:06:10.399
WEEKEND.

01:06:10.466 --> 01:06:13.035
THAT WE HAVE -- INCREASED

01:06:13.102 --> 01:06:14.670
EMISSIONS FROM.

01:06:14.737 --> 01:06:16.439
OMAR TRANSPORTATION SECTOR

01:06:16.505 --> 01:06:17.707
WHETHER IT'S THE TRUCKS ARE THE

01:06:17.773 --> 01:06:20.343
FREIGHT AND I HAVE THE LUXURY OF

01:06:20.409 --> 01:06:22.978
HAVING THE FREEWAYS THE

01:06:23.045 --> 01:06:24.980
RAILYARDS THE POOR -- AND THEN

01:06:25.047 --> 01:06:26.749
THE STATIONARY SOURCES ALSO AND

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:28.017
AND MIKE BACKYARD SO HEAVILY

01:06:28.084 --> 01:06:31.354
IMPACTED COMMUNITY THERE AND WE

01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:32.888
WE FEEL IT WITH THE ADDITIONAL

01:06:32.955 --> 01:06:33.956
TRUCKS ON THE ROAD.

01:06:34.023 --> 01:06:35.491
THERE HAVE BEEN EFFICIENCIES AT

01:06:35.558 --> 01:06:37.827
THE PORT OF LONG BEACH THAT ARE

01:06:37.893 --> 01:06:40.029
ADDING MORE TRUCKS ALSO AND SO

01:06:40.096 --> 01:06:41.230
WHILE THE PORT ITSELF MIGHT BE A

01:06:41.297 --> 01:06:41.997
LITTLE BIT GREENER THE TRUCKS

01:06:42.064 --> 01:06:42.765
THAT ARE.

01:06:42.832 --> 01:06:43.933
ON THE FREEWAYS ARE NOT GREEN

01:06:43.999 --> 01:06:45.601
ARROW AND WE'RE ADDING MANY MORE

01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:47.837
TRAXXAS HAS GOOD MOVEMENTS HAS

01:06:47.903 --> 01:06:49.372
INCREASED AND IT'S TIED TO OUR

01:06:49.438 --> 01:06:51.440
MARKET. TO EAT WE CONTINUE TO

01:06:51.507 --> 01:06:55.478
SEE AN INCREASE ON

01:06:55.544 --> 01:06:58.381
TRANSPORTATION -- AND FOR

01:06:58.447 --> 01:07:01.484
TRANSPORTATION SOURCES OUT THERE.

01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:02.818
WHAT ARE ORDER THOSE TRENDS MEAN

01:07:02.885 --> 01:07:04.987
TO YOU AS FAR AS G. C. TARGETS

01:07:05.054 --> 01:07:06.655
IN AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES YOU

01:07:06.722 --> 01:07:07.723
KNOW IT THAT'S BEEN ONE OF MY

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:10.092
BIG PUSH OF GOING FROM REGIONAL

01:07:10.159 --> 01:07:11.494
TO TO LOCAL?

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:12.995
I. SELFISHLY BECAUSE I LIVE

01:07:13.062 --> 01:07:14.196
THEIR LIVES SURE I MEAN IT

01:07:14.263 --> 01:07:15.030
EVERYBODY EXPERIENCES THESE

01:07:15.097 --> 01:07:16.198
THINGS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES

01:07:16.265 --> 01:07:18.434
WHETHER YOU'RE IN AN AFFLUENT OR

01:07:18.501 --> 01:07:20.636
A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY BUT IN

01:07:20.703 --> 01:07:22.138
PARTICULAR IF YOU'RE IN A

01:07:22.204 --> 01:07:23.973
COMMANDING THE THIS IMPACTED BY

01:07:24.039 --> 01:07:26.108
GOODS MOVEMENT -- YOU KNOW EVEN

01:07:26.175 --> 01:07:27.410
IF YOU ARE TWIN OF THAT

01:07:27.476 --> 01:07:30.546
ABSOLUTELY MOST IMPACTED YOU'RE

01:07:30.613 --> 01:07:32.047
STILL GOING TO BE EXPERIENCING

01:07:32.114 --> 01:07:35.284
WAVES OF TRAFFIC AND AND YOU

01:07:35.351 --> 01:07:36.886
KNOW IT'S IT'S VISIBLE AND

01:07:36.952 --> 01:07:38.821
TANGIBLE AND IT HAS HEALTH.

01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:42.558
IMPACTS AS WELL SO -- HAVING HAD

01:07:42.625 --> 01:07:44.460
THE OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT YOUR

01:07:44.527 --> 01:07:45.995
DISTRICT I KNOW YOU'VE GOT

01:07:46.061 --> 01:07:47.930
SCHOOLS AND HOMES THAT ARE YOU

01:07:47.997 --> 01:07:49.398
KNOW VERY CLOSE TO WHERE THESE

01:07:49.465 --> 01:07:50.800
FACILITIES ARE.

01:07:50.866 --> 01:07:53.536
AND WE HAVE TO FIND WAYS TO MOVE

01:07:53.602 --> 01:07:56.639
FASTER I THINK A AND CUT DEEPER

01:07:56.705 --> 01:07:58.607
FRANKLY I MEAN THAT WHAT WE'VE

01:07:58.674 --> 01:07:59.208
DONE TO DATE.

01:07:59.275 --> 01:08:02.445
IS NOT ENOUGH -- THIS YEAR AS

01:08:02.511 --> 01:08:04.880
YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON

01:08:04.947 --> 01:08:07.016
GETTING AN INSPECTION PROGRAM

01:08:07.082 --> 01:08:08.651
FOR TRUCKS BECAUSE OF WE CAN

01:08:08.717 --> 01:08:11.053
ADOPT A REGULATION THAT'S WELL

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:11.887
AND GOOD.

01:08:11.954 --> 01:08:14.356
BUT THE RATE OF NON COMPLIANCE

01:08:14.423 --> 01:08:16.125
WITH THE REGULATIONS IN THAT

01:08:16.192 --> 01:08:18.594
SECTOR IN PARTICULAR IS VERY

01:08:18.661 --> 01:08:21.297
HIGH -- THERE WERE CERTAIN

01:08:21.363 --> 01:08:23.365
NUMBER OF OF FLEETS ESPECIALLY

01:08:23.432 --> 01:08:25.601
SOME OF THE LARGER FLEETS WHERE --

01:08:25.668 --> 01:08:27.336
YOU KNOW THEY CAN AFFORD TO PUT

01:08:27.403 --> 01:08:28.571
NEW EQUIPMENT ON AND BUY NEW

01:08:28.637 --> 01:08:31.507
EQUIPMENT -- AND THEY DO THAT

01:08:31.574 --> 01:08:34.610
PRETTY RAPIDLY OTHERS THAT ARE

01:08:34.677 --> 01:08:36.879
SMALLER -- ARE REALLY OFTENTIMES

01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:39.849
DELAYING OR AVOIDING -- ANY KIND

01:08:39.915 --> 01:08:42.685
OF COMPLIANCE AND SO THIS YEAR

01:08:42.751 --> 01:08:45.488
IS GONNA BE A BIG YEAR.

01:08:45.554 --> 01:08:47.590
FOR THE FIRST TIME THERE WILL BE

01:08:47.656 --> 01:08:50.059
OWNERS OF TRUCKS THAT WILL NOT

01:08:50.125 --> 01:08:51.994
BE ABLE TO REGISTER THEM IN THE

01:08:52.061 --> 01:08:53.696
STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THEY

01:08:53.762 --> 01:08:54.463
HAVEN'T MET.

01:08:54.530 --> 01:09:00.603
THE CURRENT -- REQUIREMENTS FOR

01:09:00.669 --> 01:09:02.104
UPGRADING THEIR FACILITIES AND

01:09:02.171 --> 01:09:02.872
SO WE KNOW WE'VE BEEN OUT THERE

01:09:02.938 --> 01:09:04.039
TRYING TO EDUCATE AND ADVOCATE

01:09:04.106 --> 01:09:04.974
AND MAKE PEOPLE AWARE OF LOAN

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:07.243
PROGRAMS THAT EXIST AND SO FORTH

01:09:07.309 --> 01:09:10.145
BUT IT'S STILL -- HI I THINK

01:09:10.212 --> 01:09:11.313
THERE'S GONNA BE AT A

01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:13.749
SIGNIFICANT OUTCRY.

01:09:13.816 --> 01:09:16.018
IN SOME QUARTERS WHEN PEOPLE

01:09:16.085 --> 01:09:18.220
FIND THAT -- THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE

01:09:18.287 --> 01:09:20.022
NOT IN COMPLIANCE AND THEY WON'T

01:09:20.089 --> 01:09:22.424
BE ABLE TO CONTINUE. TO OPERATE

01:09:22.491 --> 01:09:24.326
OUT OF COMPLIANCE AS THAT THAT

01:09:24.393 --> 01:09:25.594
THE BOOM WILL GET WILL GET

01:09:25.661 --> 01:09:28.230
LOWERED BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S

01:09:28.297 --> 01:09:30.099
THAT'S IMPORTANT FACTOR OF

01:09:30.165 --> 01:09:31.967
COURSE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IF

01:09:32.034 --> 01:09:33.769
PEOPLE ARE COMPLYING THEY DON'T

01:09:33.836 --> 01:09:37.239
WANT TO HAVE THEIR OPERATIONS

01:09:37.306 --> 01:09:39.041
UNDER CUT BY SOMEBODY WHO CAN

01:09:39.108 --> 01:09:40.442
GET AWAY WITH YOU KNOW.

01:09:40.509 --> 01:09:42.278
NOT PAYING THE PRICE FOR PUTTING

01:09:42.344 --> 01:09:45.180
ON UPDATED ADEQUATE MEANT BUT

01:09:45.247 --> 01:09:47.483
WHEN IT COMES TO THE FUTURE AND

01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:50.452
THE CONTINUED -- OPERATION OF

01:09:50.519 --> 01:09:53.556
OUR LOGISTICS COMMUNITIES OF OUR

01:09:53.622 --> 01:09:55.491
PORTS AND THE THE THROUGH PUT

01:09:55.558 --> 01:09:57.560
THAT WE HAVE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

01:09:57.626 --> 01:10:00.829
MOVE TOWARDS ZERO EMISSION

01:10:00.896 --> 01:10:03.299
FREIGHT WHICH REALLY MEANS.

01:10:03.365 --> 01:10:05.434
ELECTRIFICATION OF THE WHOLE

01:10:05.501 --> 01:10:08.604
FREIGHT QUARTERS AND WHEN WE

01:10:08.671 --> 01:10:10.606
START SPENDING MONEY TO UPGRADE

01:10:10.673 --> 01:10:12.675
THOSE FACILITIES ARE WHEN WE SEE

01:10:12.741 --> 01:10:13.943
PRIVATE INVESTMENTS IN THOSE

01:10:14.009 --> 01:10:15.344
AREAS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE

01:10:15.411 --> 01:10:16.879
LOOKING TOWARDS.

01:10:16.946 --> 01:10:20.115
MUCH MUCH MORE -- ZERO THAT THAN

01:10:20.182 --> 01:10:26.055
WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST.

01:10:26.121 --> 01:10:27.256
SO -- YOU SORRY TO TOUCH ON SOME

01:10:27.323 --> 01:10:28.257
OF THE STRATEGIES TO TRY TO MOVE

01:10:28.324 --> 01:10:29.558
FASTER AND DEEPER AND AND YOU

01:10:29.625 --> 01:10:31.460
GAVE US THE EXAMPLE SHORT TERM.

01:10:31.527 --> 01:10:32.094
WHAT THE TRUCKS AND YOU GIVE US

01:10:32.161 --> 01:10:33.495
THE EXAMPLE LONG TERM WITH

01:10:33.562 --> 01:10:37.433
ELECTRIFICATION OF THE RAILWAY --

01:10:37.499 --> 01:10:39.268
AND CITING THOSE ARE GOOD.

01:10:39.335 --> 01:10:40.703
OF STARTING AND ENDING POINT

01:10:40.769 --> 01:10:42.271
FOCUSES FOR MY NEXT QUESTION OF

01:10:42.338 --> 01:10:44.006
WHAT'S WHAT'S IN THE IN BETWEEN

01:10:44.073 --> 01:10:44.506
WHAT ARE SOME ADDITIONAL

01:10:44.573 --> 01:10:45.574
STRATEGIES.

01:10:45.641 --> 01:10:48.243
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND THIS --

01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:50.646
MOBILE -- SECTOR PIECE WHETHER

01:10:50.713 --> 01:10:55.851
IT'S CARS TRUCKS -- RATES.

01:10:55.918 --> 01:10:56.719
OUR PLANES I MEAN YOU KNOW WHAT

01:10:56.785 --> 01:10:58.120
WHAT ARE SOME WHAT ARE SOME

01:10:58.187 --> 01:10:59.989
OTHER THINGS IN IN THE INNER --

01:11:00.055 --> 01:11:02.825
BECAUSE IN IN THE SHORT TERM --

01:11:02.891 --> 01:11:03.892
THE TRUCKS.

01:11:03.959 --> 01:11:05.027
HAVING TO HAVE.

01:11:05.094 --> 01:11:06.328
BEEN COMPLAINTS AGAINST

01:11:06.395 --> 01:11:08.330
REGISTRATION I THINK WE'LL HAVE

01:11:08.397 --> 01:11:09.632
SOME POSITIVE EFFECTS IN

01:11:09.698 --> 01:11:11.133
COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE.

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:12.801
BUT I DON'T THINK IT'LL BEING

01:11:12.868 --> 01:11:14.503
FAST ENOUGH DEEP ENOUGH RIGHT

01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:15.504
AND SO WHAT ELSE ARE WE GOING TO

01:11:15.571 --> 01:11:17.473
BE DOING IN THERE WHAT ARE SOME

01:11:17.539 --> 01:11:19.141
OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU.

01:11:19.208 --> 01:11:20.376
THAT AIR BE THROUGH THE STATE OR

01:11:20.442 --> 01:11:21.644
THROUGH OTHER AVENUES IS

01:11:21.710 --> 01:11:23.012
STARTING TO LOOK INTO SHORT IN

01:11:23.078 --> 01:11:23.979
THE INTERIM.

01:11:24.046 --> 01:11:25.547
SO WE'VE BEEN LOOKING WE'VE BEEN

01:11:25.614 --> 01:11:27.950
WORKING WITH REGIONAL AIR

01:11:28.017 --> 01:11:30.519
DISTRICTS I HAD -- TO FINDING

01:11:30.586 --> 01:11:33.589
WAYS TO BRING WAREHOUSES AND

01:11:33.656 --> 01:11:36.291
OTHER STATIONARY FACILITIES.

01:11:36.358 --> 01:11:41.063
IN TO THE INTO THE STATUS OF

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:44.033
TAKING RESPONSIBILITY -- FOR

01:11:44.099 --> 01:11:46.435
MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE

01:11:46.502 --> 01:11:48.771
ATTRACTING AND USING THE

01:11:48.837 --> 01:11:51.440
CLEANEST POSSIBLE EQUIPMENT --

01:11:51.507 --> 01:11:54.109
WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:11:54.176 --> 01:11:57.279
TO NOT SITE FACILITIES IN PLACES

01:11:57.346 --> 01:11:59.782
WHERE THEY WILL -- BE CAUSING

01:11:59.848 --> 01:12:01.684
UNDUE IMPACT ON THE SURROUNDING

01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:04.019
COMMUNITIES -- GETTING MORE

01:12:04.086 --> 01:12:06.221
EFFICIENT ABOUT THE WAY THAT WAY

01:12:06.288 --> 01:12:07.723
MOVE GOODS AROUND WHICH REALLY

01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:09.892
REQUIRES A MUCH CLOSER

01:12:09.958 --> 01:12:11.427
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE

01:12:11.493 --> 01:12:14.329
TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AGENCIES

01:12:14.396 --> 01:12:17.633
AND A MORE -- COHERENT -- LOOK

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:19.168
AT HOW WE SPEND OUR

01:12:19.234 --> 01:12:20.936
TRANSPORTATION DOLLARS TO MAKE

01:12:21.003 --> 01:12:23.572
SURE THAT AS AS WE TRY TO DO

01:12:23.639 --> 01:12:25.708
WITH OUR REGULATIONS THAT WE ARE

01:12:25.774 --> 01:12:28.277
GETTING AS MUCH BANG AS POSSIBLE

01:12:28.343 --> 01:12:29.945
OUT OF EVERY BUCK THAT THE STATE

01:12:30.012 --> 01:12:33.015
IS PAYING. TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:12:33.082 --> 01:12:34.650
IT'S BEING UTILIZED.

01:12:34.717 --> 01:12:36.318
FOR MAKING FACILITIES GREENER

01:12:36.385 --> 01:12:39.388
AND HEALTHIER AT THE SAME TIME

01:12:39.455 --> 01:12:41.190
AND THERE ARE TOOLS THAT ARE IN

01:12:41.256 --> 01:12:42.691
WOULD SEEING DEMONSTRATIONS NOW

01:12:42.758 --> 01:12:44.827
OF SOME OF THOSE IDEAS OUT THERE

01:12:44.893 --> 01:12:46.095
IN THE REAL WORLD.

01:12:46.161 --> 01:12:47.596
SOME OF THEM ARE JUST ON THE

01:12:47.663 --> 01:12:50.032
DRAWING BOARDS AT THE MOMENT BUT

01:12:50.099 --> 01:12:51.967
IT'S THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST

01:12:52.034 --> 01:12:57.306
AND ACTIVITY I WOULD SAY AND THE

01:12:57.372 --> 01:12:58.407
GOVERNOR I KNOW HAS SPOKEN ON

01:12:58.474 --> 01:12:59.041
THIS TOPIC IN TERMS OF WARNING

01:12:59.108 --> 01:13:01.143
HIS TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES --

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:04.046
TO PLAY A MORE -- ACTIVE AND

01:13:04.113 --> 01:13:06.682
PROACTIVE ROLE IN LEADING ON

01:13:06.749 --> 01:13:08.617
SOME OF THESE.

01:13:08.684 --> 01:13:10.853
ARE THERE EXAMPLES RIGHT NOW OF

01:13:10.919 --> 01:13:14.022
HELLO -- THE STATE AIR BE AT

01:13:14.089 --> 01:13:15.824
THEIR TO THE STATE OR THROUGH

01:13:15.891 --> 01:13:17.493
THE LOCAL -- DISTRICTS.

01:13:17.559 --> 01:13:19.128
IS STARTING TO ENGAGE IN THOSE

01:13:19.194 --> 01:13:19.795
TRANSPORTATION WITH THE

01:13:19.862 --> 01:13:21.930
STRUCTURE TATIAN AGENCIES OR THE

01:13:21.997 --> 01:13:24.366
LAND USE AGENCIES.

01:13:24.433 --> 01:13:25.167
CURRENTLY.

01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:26.401
YOU KNOW -- THERE WAS

01:13:26.468 --> 01:13:28.937
LEGISLATION THAT PASSED AND I

01:13:29.004 --> 01:13:29.738
WAS ARE FORGOTTEN THE BILL

01:13:29.805 --> 01:13:31.306
NUMBER BUT THERE WAS A A

01:13:31.373 --> 01:13:32.808
REQUIREMENT THAT WAS PASSED A

01:13:32.875 --> 01:13:33.876
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.

01:13:33.942 --> 01:13:36.044
THAT -- THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD

01:13:36.111 --> 01:13:37.513
AND THE CALIFORNIA

01:13:37.579 --> 01:13:39.214
TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION HAVE

01:13:39.281 --> 01:13:41.416
TO MEET TOGETHER SEVERAL TIMES A

01:13:41.483 --> 01:13:42.985
YEAR THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT HAD

01:13:43.051 --> 01:13:45.854
NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE -- AND THE

01:13:45.921 --> 01:13:47.556
FIRST TIME OR TWO THAT WE MET

01:13:47.623 --> 01:13:49.625
FRANKLY IT WAS PRETTY AWKWARD

01:13:49.691 --> 01:13:51.827
BECAUSE WE OPERATE VERY

01:13:51.894 --> 01:13:54.530
DIFFERENTLY ARE -- OUR APPROACH

01:13:54.596 --> 01:13:57.399
TO ISSUES IS DIFFERENT THEY HAND

01:13:57.466 --> 01:13:58.901
OUT LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY WITH

01:13:58.967 --> 01:14:01.770
WHICH IS GREAT -- BUT DON'T

01:14:01.837 --> 01:14:04.940
REGULATE AND THEY YOU KNOW.

01:14:05.007 --> 01:14:06.341
BASICALLY TAKE PROJECTS THAT ARE

01:14:06.408 --> 01:14:08.911
BROUGHT TO THEM AND ACT ON THEM

01:14:08.977 --> 01:14:10.679
WHEREAS AT THE AIR RESOURCES

01:14:10.746 --> 01:14:12.147
BOARD WHERE MORE AND IN THE

01:14:12.214 --> 01:14:13.615
BUSINESS OF DEVISING.

01:14:13.682 --> 01:14:15.818
REGULATIONS AND SENDING THEM OUT

01:14:15.884 --> 01:14:21.223
INTO THE WORLD SO THERE WERE

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:22.357
CULTURAL.

01:14:22.424 --> 01:14:24.193
DIFFERENCES BUT THE LAST TIME WE

01:14:24.259 --> 01:14:26.195
MET -- WE MET DOWN IN -- SAN

01:14:26.261 --> 01:14:29.231
DIEGO AREA TO TALK ABOUT A

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:33.001
COMMON CONCERN WHICH IS THE FOR

01:14:33.068 --> 01:14:33.969
THE FACT THAT THE FEDERAL

01:14:34.036 --> 01:14:35.571
GOVERNMENT IS LOOKING TO ROLL

01:14:35.637 --> 01:14:36.905
BACK.

01:14:36.972 --> 01:14:38.407
VEHICLE EMISSIONS STANDARDS

01:14:38.473 --> 01:14:41.710
BECAUSE THAT ACTION COULD THROW

01:14:41.777 --> 01:14:44.313
OUR REGION'S OUT OF COMPLIANCE

01:14:44.379 --> 01:14:45.447
WITH THE CLEAN AIR ACT THEY

01:14:45.514 --> 01:14:47.349
WOULD NO LONGER BE ABLE TO SHOW

01:14:47.416 --> 01:14:49.318
THAT THEY WERE COMPLYING WITH

01:14:49.384 --> 01:14:50.619
THE REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY'RE

01:14:50.686 --> 01:14:52.788
TRANSPORTATION PLANS -- ARE IN

01:14:52.855 --> 01:14:55.123
CONFORMITY WITH THEIR AIR PLANS

01:14:55.190 --> 01:14:59.094
AND SO TOGETHER -- WE HAVE BEEN

01:14:59.161 --> 01:15:00.596
OUT EDUCATING PEOPLE AROUND THE

01:15:00.662 --> 01:15:02.831
COUNTRY AND THE TRANSPORTATION

01:15:02.898 --> 01:15:05.000
AGENCIES HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY

01:15:05.067 --> 01:15:07.669
ACTIVE -- IN CONGRESS BY

01:15:07.736 --> 01:15:09.238
EDUCATING THEIR MEMBERS ABOUT

01:15:09.304 --> 01:15:10.706
THE FACT THAT.

01:15:10.772 --> 01:15:12.341
THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT GLOBAL

01:15:12.407 --> 01:15:14.776
WARMING THIS IS ALSO WHAT ABOUT

01:15:14.843 --> 01:15:17.279
AIR POLLUTION IF THE IF THE

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:18.547
VEHICLES ARE NOT.

01:15:18.614 --> 01:15:19.781
MEANING THESE EMISSIONS

01:15:19.848 --> 01:15:21.383
STANDARDS IT WILL HAVE THE

01:15:21.450 --> 01:15:23.118
EFFECT OF UNDERCUTTING OUR

01:15:23.185 --> 01:15:24.887
ABILITY TO MEET THOSE STANDARDS

01:15:24.953 --> 01:15:27.656
SO -- THIS IS NOW A THREAT TO

01:15:27.723 --> 01:15:29.091
CONSTRUCTION IT'S A THREAT TO

01:15:29.157 --> 01:15:31.126
ACT YOU KNOW ONGOING ACTIVITIES

01:15:31.193 --> 01:15:33.128
THAT PROGRAM FEDERAL

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:36.198
TRANSPORTATION DOLLARS AND SO --

01:15:36.265 --> 01:15:39.167
WE'RE NOW AT A MUCH MORE.

01:15:39.234 --> 01:15:41.570
ACTIVE AND EFFECTIVE

01:15:41.637 --> 01:15:43.138
COLLABORATION THAN WE HAD EVER

01:15:43.205 --> 01:15:45.741
BEEN BEFORE BETWEEN THE AIR AND

01:15:45.807 --> 01:15:47.776
THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES AND

01:15:47.843 --> 01:15:52.281
I'M SURE THERE ARE OTHER

01:15:52.347 --> 01:15:54.950
OPPORTUNITIES TO DO MORE.

01:15:55.017 --> 01:15:56.318
WHEN WHEN WAS THAT LAST MEETING?

01:15:56.385 --> 01:15:59.021
I WAS JUST A MONTH OR SO AGO.

01:15:59.087 --> 01:16:00.889
THE SOFT LITTLE START TO TRICKLE

01:16:00.956 --> 01:16:02.090
DOWN TO THE LOCAL FOLKS IN --

01:16:02.157 --> 01:16:03.859
THERE'S I MEAN I WILL SAY THAT.

01:16:03.926 --> 01:16:05.327
I GO HOME AND AND WHILE WE I

01:16:05.394 --> 01:16:07.996
HAVE A LOT OF PRIDE IN THE AB

01:16:08.063 --> 01:16:09.531
SIX SEVENTEEN WORK THAT WE AND

01:16:09.598 --> 01:16:14.036
THE BILL WE PASSED WITH THAT AB.

01:16:14.102 --> 01:16:14.670
THREE NINETY EIGHT I HAD A SURE

01:16:14.736 --> 01:16:15.270
SOME OF THE CONCERNS WITH MY

01:16:15.337 --> 01:16:16.305
CONSTITUENTS OF WHETHER OR NOT

01:16:16.371 --> 01:16:17.906
IT'S GOING TO BE ENOUGH IT'S

01:16:17.973 --> 01:16:19.141
GOING TO BE ENOUGH FAST ENOUGH --

01:16:19.207 --> 01:16:21.109
WHETHER OR NOT IN EXCHANGE FOR

01:16:21.176 --> 01:16:23.111
THAT WHAT WHAT WE'RE GETTING OR

01:16:23.178 --> 01:16:25.180
NOT GETTING FROM CAPITATED IS

01:16:25.247 --> 01:16:26.548
WORTH IT IS WORTH THE TRADE OFF.

01:16:26.615 --> 01:16:28.517
I AND AND THAT'S A QUESTION THAT

01:16:28.583 --> 01:16:29.351
TIME GOING TO BE ANSWERED

01:16:29.418 --> 01:16:31.186
ANYTIME SOON RIGHT WE HAVE TO

01:16:31.253 --> 01:16:32.220
WAIT TO SEE.

01:16:32.287 --> 01:16:34.556
WHAT THE DATA TELLS US?

01:16:34.623 --> 01:16:36.992
ALONG THE WAY BUT IRRESPECTIVE

01:16:37.059 --> 01:16:38.460
OF THAT THING WITH THE SENTIMENT

01:16:38.527 --> 01:16:41.330
OF OF WHETHER WERE INTRACTABLE --

01:16:41.396 --> 01:16:42.531
TWENTY THIRTY HOLD HER TWENTY

01:16:42.597 --> 01:16:44.700
FIFTY GOALS AND AND THE FACT

01:16:44.766 --> 01:16:46.068
THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE TOOLS YET.

01:16:46.134 --> 01:16:47.636
THERE'S A DISCUSSION OF MAYBE WE

01:16:47.703 --> 01:16:48.937
DO HAVE THE TOOLS BUT WE HAVEN'T

01:16:49.004 --> 01:16:51.173
HAD THE POLITICAL WILL TO USE

01:16:51.239 --> 01:16:52.641
THEM -- THERE'S BEEN DISCUSSION

01:16:52.708 --> 01:16:55.377
ABOUT INDIRECT SOURCE RULES --

01:16:55.444 --> 01:16:58.080
ACROSS THE STATE IN SOME REGIONS

01:16:58.146 --> 01:17:00.215
ARE MORE OPEN TO THAT THAN THAN

01:17:00.282 --> 01:17:02.150
OTHERS -- WE TALK ABOUT

01:17:02.217 --> 01:17:03.986
WAREHOUSES RIGHT AND HAVING THEM

01:17:04.052 --> 01:17:06.021
BE A PART OF THE DISCUSSION AND

01:17:06.088 --> 01:17:07.022
THEIR ROLE OF WITHIN THEIR

01:17:07.089 --> 01:17:08.023
ACCESS RULES AS THEY ARE THESE

01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:08.991
MAGNETS.

01:17:09.057 --> 01:17:11.360
OUT THERE OR THE FAILURE TO HAVE

01:17:11.426 --> 01:17:13.462
A RAIL YARD WITH TWO OPERATOR

01:17:13.528 --> 01:17:15.097
SOMEONE THAT TURNS AWAY TRUCKS

01:17:15.163 --> 01:17:16.131
THAT ARE NOT.

01:17:16.198 --> 01:17:17.833
IN COMPLIANCE AND ONE THAT JUST

01:17:17.899 --> 01:17:18.767
SENT TO LIST TO THEIR DISTRICT

01:17:18.834 --> 01:17:20.736
AND I'M NOT SURE HOW HOW GREAT

01:17:20.802 --> 01:17:21.903
OF A STRATEGY THAT IS RIGHT AND

01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:23.305
HOW DO WE GET THEM TO ACTUALLY

01:17:23.372 --> 01:17:25.340
MAYBE TURN AWAY AND DO THEIR

01:17:25.407 --> 01:17:27.576
PART THAT WAY -- AND SO I THINK

01:17:27.642 --> 01:17:33.982
WE KNOW THAT WHERE WERE NOT.

01:17:34.049 --> 01:17:35.317
ON TRACK FOR THE LONG TURNS OF

01:17:35.384 --> 01:17:36.118
TWENTY FIFTY GOALS BUT THERE IS

01:17:36.184 --> 01:17:37.686
THAT QUESTION OF DO WE HAVE

01:17:37.753 --> 01:17:39.588
TOOLS OUT THERE THAT WE MAYBE.

01:17:39.654 --> 01:17:40.455
SHOULD BE IS AND HAVING BEEN

01:17:40.522 --> 01:17:42.591
USING TO GET US ON TRACK AND

01:17:42.657 --> 01:17:43.425
MAYBE GET US ON TRACK QUICKER

01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:44.059
AND SOMEBODY'S COMMUNITIES THAT

01:17:44.126 --> 01:17:47.162
ARE THE MOST IMPACTED -- DO YOU

01:17:47.229 --> 01:17:50.065
HAVE ANY OPINIONS ON THAT.

01:17:50.132 --> 01:17:52.601
WELL IT YOU KNOW IT IT'S SO BUT

01:17:52.667 --> 01:17:53.835
IT'S GREAT TO BE.

01:17:53.902 --> 01:17:57.272
AT A POINT NOW WHERE PEOPLE ARE

01:17:57.339 --> 01:17:58.573
ASKING EVEN SOME OF THESE

01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.642
QUESTIONS BECAUSE HAVING STARTED

01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:02.244
WORK AS THAT.

01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:04.980
ENVIRONMENTAL ADVOCATE BACK IN

01:18:05.047 --> 01:18:07.883
THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WHEN WE

01:18:07.949 --> 01:18:10.485
WERE SUING TO BLOCK NEW FREEWAY

01:18:10.552 --> 01:18:13.188
IS THAT WERE BEING PLANNED -- TO

01:18:13.255 --> 01:18:15.557
GO THROUGH LOW INCOME COMMUNITY

01:18:15.624 --> 01:18:17.559
ACCESS THAT'S WHERE THE LAND WAS

01:18:17.626 --> 01:18:18.860
THE CHEAPEST AND NO

01:18:18.927 --> 01:18:21.329
CONSIDERATION OF TRANSIT AS A

01:18:21.396 --> 01:18:23.331
ALTERNATIVE TO JUST TRYING TO

01:18:23.398 --> 01:18:25.000
BUILD MORE AND MORE LANES OF

01:18:25.067 --> 01:18:25.901
FREEWAYS.

01:18:25.967 --> 01:18:29.871
IT'S TAKEN A LONG TIME -- TO GET

01:18:29.938 --> 01:18:31.973
CALIFORNIA I THINK TO THINK OF

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:34.376
ITSELF AS A PLACE WHERE WE WOULD

01:18:34.443 --> 01:18:37.846
WANT TO LOOK AT MORE DENSITY --

01:18:37.913 --> 01:18:39.448
IN THAT USED TO BE SORT OF A

01:18:39.514 --> 01:18:40.649
DIRTY WORD THERE WAS AT

01:18:40.715 --> 01:18:42.617
ENVIRONMENTAL ADVOCACY GROUP IN

01:18:42.684 --> 01:18:44.619
LA WHEN I FIRST STARTED WORKING

01:18:44.686 --> 01:18:45.120
THERE CALLED.

01:18:45.187 --> 01:18:47.322
NOT YET NEW YORK AND THEIR GOAL

01:18:47.389 --> 01:18:49.758
IN LIFE WAS TO PREVENT APARTMENT

01:18:49.825 --> 01:18:51.793
BUILDINGS FROM BEING BUILT IN

01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:54.496
NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WERE FORMERLY

01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:59.301
ONLY YEAH YOU KNOW SINGLE STORY --

01:18:59.367 --> 01:19:00.302
COMMUNITY SO -- WE'RE CHANGING

01:19:00.368 --> 01:19:02.137
OUR IDEAS I THINK ABOUT WHAT'S

01:19:02.204 --> 01:19:04.106
POSSIBLE OF WHAT'S DESIRABLE.

01:19:04.172 --> 01:19:06.875
AND IT'S NOT COMING ONLY OUT OF

01:19:06.942 --> 01:19:09.811
CONCERN FOR AIR QUALITY

01:19:09.878 --> 01:19:11.513
CERTAINLYOR FOR A CLIMATE

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:13.381
CHANGE BUT IT THESE THINGS DO

01:19:13.448 --> 01:19:15.750
WORK TOGETHER THE FACT OF

01:19:15.817 --> 01:19:17.752
CLIMATE CHANGE NOW SO.

01:19:17.819 --> 01:19:23.458
VISIBLE AN OBVIOUS AROUND OUR

01:19:23.525 --> 01:19:23.992
STATE.

01:19:24.059 --> 01:19:25.193
MEANS THAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING

01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:26.528
FOR MAYBE MORE RADICAL SOLUTIONS

01:19:26.595 --> 01:19:27.095
AT LEAST WILLING TO CONSIDER

01:19:27.162 --> 01:19:27.295
THEM.

01:19:27.362 --> 01:19:30.699
AND I THINK WE SHOULD BE LOOKING

01:19:30.765 --> 01:19:32.200
FOR THOSE KINDS SOLUTIONS.

01:19:32.267 --> 01:19:34.035
WE SHOULD BE DOING IT THOUGH NOT

01:19:34.102 --> 01:19:36.938
JUST YOU KNOW AS A RB BUT REALLY

01:19:37.005 --> 01:19:39.074
ACROSS STATE GOVERNMENT TO

01:19:39.141 --> 01:19:40.075
WHEREVER.

01:19:40.142 --> 01:19:41.910
WE HAVE EITHER MONEY THAT WE'RE

01:19:41.977 --> 01:19:45.180
SPENDING OR WAY IS THAT WHERE.

01:19:45.247 --> 01:19:47.182
ENABLING OF PRACTICES TO

01:19:47.249 --> 01:19:49.751
CONTINUE THAT ARE UNHEALTHY WE

01:19:49.818 --> 01:19:51.319
SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO

01:19:51.386 --> 01:19:55.290
TURN THAT AROUND AND I'M.

01:19:55.357 --> 01:19:55.891
EXCITED THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED

01:19:55.957 --> 01:19:56.591
IN THAT.

01:19:56.658 --> 01:19:57.993
YEAH AND AND I THINK YOU KNOW WE

01:19:58.059 --> 01:20:00.695
HAVE -- THAT WE'RE THERE YET ON

01:20:00.762 --> 01:20:02.264
ON THE DENSITY.

01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:03.598
BUT WE HAVE MEMBERS ARE STARTING

01:20:03.665 --> 01:20:04.633
TO ASK THE QUESTION AT LEAST A

01:20:04.699 --> 01:20:05.967
LEGISLATURE THAT'S BEING

01:20:06.034 --> 01:20:06.935
INTRODUCED.

01:20:07.002 --> 01:20:12.908
ARE AROUND THAT -- I MEAN AND SO

01:20:12.974 --> 01:20:15.010
YOU REFERENCE -- HE SAID THAT

01:20:15.076 --> 01:20:16.278
NOTS IS THERE BE BUT OTHER

01:20:16.344 --> 01:20:17.546
AGENCIES OR OTHER AREAS WILL

01:20:17.612 --> 01:20:20.048
WHAT WHAT ARE SOME EXAMPLES YOU

01:20:20.115 --> 01:20:21.216
HAVE FOR THAT.

01:20:21.283 --> 01:20:22.551
WELL I MEAN EVEN WITH AND CAL

01:20:22.617 --> 01:20:24.319
EPA IN RECENT YEARS WE'VE

01:20:24.386 --> 01:20:26.988
DISCOVERED THAT YOU KNOW WE

01:20:27.055 --> 01:20:28.390
COULD BE WORKING MUCH MORE

01:20:28.456 --> 01:20:30.392
CLOSELY THAN WE USED TO IN THE

01:20:30.458 --> 01:20:32.627
PAST WITH THE WITH THE

01:20:32.694 --> 01:20:34.062
INTEGRATED WASTE.

01:20:34.129 --> 01:20:36.097
FOLKS -- TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:20:36.164 --> 01:20:38.934
NOTHING EVER REALLY JUST BECOMES

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.103
A WASTE OF THAT WE RE USE OR

01:20:42.170 --> 01:20:44.739
FIND WAYS TO AVOID TO THROWING

01:20:44.806 --> 01:20:46.174
AWAY IN THE FIRST PLACE.

01:20:46.241 --> 01:20:47.976
THINGS -- THAT OTHERWISE YOU'RE

01:20:48.043 --> 01:20:50.111
GONNA TAKE ENERGY AND BECAUSE

01:20:50.178 --> 01:20:52.247
POLLUTION IF THEY IF THEY ARE

01:20:52.314 --> 01:20:54.249
WASTE AND A SO A BIG PART OF THE

01:20:54.316 --> 01:20:58.787
ANSWER -- TO MEETING ARE VERY

01:20:58.853 --> 01:20:59.154
TOUGH.

01:20:59.221 --> 01:21:02.090
GOALS REALLY HAS BEEN LOOKING

01:21:02.157 --> 01:21:04.659
FOR WAYS BETTER IDEAS AND

01:21:04.726 --> 01:21:07.862
TECHNOLOGIES FOR HOW TO MANAGE

01:21:07.929 --> 01:21:10.432
WASTE IN OUR SOCIETY -- THERE'S

01:21:10.498 --> 01:21:13.435
A LOT OF TALK NOW ABOUT FOOD AND

01:21:13.501 --> 01:21:15.604
HOW IT'S PRODUCED AND HOW IT IS --

01:21:15.670 --> 01:21:18.607
BROUGHT TO MARKET AND JUST

01:21:18.673 --> 01:21:21.142
RECENTLY WE BEGAN WORKING WITH

01:21:21.209 --> 01:21:23.979
THE CALLIE PA OF THE DEPARTMENT

01:21:24.045 --> 01:21:25.080
OF FOOD.

01:21:25.146 --> 01:21:27.115
CULTURE ON A PROGRAM IN WHICH

01:21:27.182 --> 01:21:29.117
PEOPLE WHO EAT OUT IN

01:21:29.184 --> 01:21:33.154
RESTAURANTS CAN -- PAY A TINY

01:21:33.221 --> 01:21:36.424
AMOUNT EXTRA ON THEIR TRACK AND

01:21:36.491 --> 01:21:38.059
HAVE THAT MONEY GO BACK -- TO

01:21:38.126 --> 01:21:41.963
FARMS TO PAY -- FOR PEOPLE TO

01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:43.765
USE THE METHODOLOGIES FOR

01:21:43.832 --> 01:21:45.900
FARMING THAT PRODUCE LESS

01:21:45.967 --> 01:21:49.571
EMISSIONS AND TO ENGAGE IN OUT

01:21:49.638 --> 01:21:51.172
THINGS LIKE WHAT THEY CALLED NO

01:21:51.239 --> 01:21:54.542
TILL AGRICULTURE WERE YOU AVOID --

01:21:54.609 --> 01:21:56.711
RELEASING RELEASING CARBON THAT

01:21:56.778 --> 01:21:59.080
STORED IN THE SOIL BUT IT COSTS

01:21:59.147 --> 01:22:00.715
MORE MONEY FOR THE FARMERS TO DO

01:22:00.782 --> 01:22:03.018
IT SO IT'S A IT'S A KIND OF A

01:22:03.084 --> 01:22:05.153
VIRTUOUS CIRCLE INSTEAD OF A

01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:06.721
VICIOUS CIRCLE TO DO SOMETHING.

01:22:06.788 --> 01:22:08.290
LIKE THAT WHERE PEOPLE

01:22:08.356 --> 01:22:10.859
PARTICIPATE IN HELPING TO MAKE

01:22:10.925 --> 01:22:12.627
THE FOOD PRODUCTION PROCESS MORE

01:22:12.694 --> 01:22:14.129
EFFICIENT AND THERE'S THERE'S

01:22:14.195 --> 01:22:16.965
JUST A LOT OF IDEAS LIKE THAT

01:22:17.032 --> 01:22:18.533
OUT THERE THAT WE NEED TO BE.

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:23.538
LOOKING AT AND FINDING WAYS TO

01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:25.707
IMPLEMENT.

01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:27.809
OKAY -- I'M GOING.

01:22:27.876 --> 01:22:31.913
TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT -- US.

01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:33.481
SECTION OF OF TODAY BECAUSE THEY

01:22:33.548 --> 01:22:34.816
DO WANT TO TRY TO KEEP US ON

01:22:34.883 --> 01:22:37.619
SCHEDULE -- THANK YOU FOR FOR

01:22:37.686 --> 01:22:39.287
YOUR TIME I KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN

01:22:39.354 --> 01:22:41.389
BUSY PLANE HOW OFTEN IS OUT

01:22:41.456 --> 01:22:43.391
THERE AND YOUR TIME IS FOR

01:22:43.458 --> 01:22:45.460
BETWEEN BEING ERE AND BEING.

01:22:45.527 --> 01:22:46.594
OUT OF THE OUT OF THE STATE AS I

01:22:46.661 --> 01:22:48.296
WANT TO BE MINDFUL OF THAT BUT I

01:22:48.363 --> 01:22:51.199
I DO WANT TO RE ITERATE.

01:22:51.266 --> 01:22:52.834
THE IMPORTANCE IN THE POWER THAT

01:22:52.901 --> 01:22:54.302
I FEEL THAT THEY'RE A STATE OR

01:22:54.369 --> 01:22:55.804
DISTRICT PASSES SOMETIMES

01:22:55.870 --> 01:22:57.706
PUSHING ALONG OUR LOCAL ARE

01:22:57.772 --> 01:22:58.540
DISTRICTS.

01:22:58.606 --> 01:22:59.641
TO MAYBE ARE NOT AS PROGRESSIVE

01:22:59.708 --> 01:23:01.443
AS WE NEED THEM TO BE HI IN

01:23:01.509 --> 01:23:02.911
LOOKING AT WAYS BEYONCE'S

01:23:02.977 --> 01:23:04.312
HANDING OUT MONEY.

01:23:04.379 --> 01:23:06.348
BUT ALSO USING THE POWER THEY

01:23:06.414 --> 01:23:07.148
HAVE WITH THE SPICE AND

01:23:07.215 --> 01:23:08.550
REGULATIONS AND HAVING THE

01:23:08.616 --> 01:23:09.784
COURAGE TO DO.

01:23:09.851 --> 01:23:10.819
WHAT'S RIGHT TO WE CAN MOVE

01:23:10.885 --> 01:23:12.120
FASTER AND DEEPER FOR THESE

01:23:12.187 --> 01:23:13.788
COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE.

01:23:13.855 --> 01:23:15.790
BEEN SO UNFAIRLY BURDEN AND

01:23:15.857 --> 01:23:16.791
CONTINUE TO BE.

01:23:16.858 --> 01:23:18.560
ESPECIALLY AS WE LOOK AT THE

01:23:18.626 --> 01:23:19.794
GROWING ECONOMY AROUND THE

01:23:19.861 --> 01:23:21.329
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR AND I I

01:23:21.396 --> 01:23:22.397
KNOW THAT'S A DELICATE BALANCE

01:23:22.464 --> 01:23:23.365
SOME OF THOSE ARE.

01:23:23.431 --> 01:23:25.066
WE HAVE GOOD JOB SIR THERE ARE

01:23:25.133 --> 01:23:26.668
IMPORTANT PART OF THE ECONOMY

01:23:26.735 --> 01:23:28.503
BUT I CAN'T KEEP COMING AT THE

01:23:28.570 --> 01:23:30.138
EXPENSE OF CERTAIN COMMUNITIES I

01:23:30.205 --> 01:23:31.139
GET TREATED LIKE THEIR

01:23:31.206 --> 01:23:33.208
DISPOSABLE OR THEIR BACKYARDS

01:23:33.274 --> 01:23:35.343
ARE WASTELANDS AND SO -- I THINK

01:23:35.410 --> 01:23:37.412
AS WE TALK ABOUT EQUITY THESE

01:23:37.479 --> 01:23:38.646
ARE REAL PEOPLE REAL PEOPLE THAT

01:23:38.713 --> 01:23:39.981
I GO HOME.

01:23:40.048 --> 01:23:41.483
TO EVERY WEEK -- AND I KEEP

01:23:41.549 --> 01:23:42.550
TELLING THEM THAT THE MATTER

01:23:42.617 --> 01:23:43.852
JUST AS MUCH AS THE FOLKS IN

01:23:43.918 --> 01:23:45.120
OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT ARE NOT

01:23:45.186 --> 01:23:46.421
US IMPACTED IN.

01:23:46.488 --> 01:23:47.856
AND HAVE THE RESOURCES TO HELP

01:23:47.922 --> 01:23:49.224
THEMSELVES THAT WHEN THERE IS A

01:23:49.290 --> 01:23:51.259
CRISIS BECAUSE THE CLIMATE

01:23:51.326 --> 01:23:52.894
CHANGE ARE BECAUSE OF POLLUTION.

01:23:52.961 --> 01:23:55.997
OUT THERE ARE AND SO I HOPE I DO

01:23:56.064 --> 01:23:58.566
APPRECIATE THE UPDATE I HOPE --

01:23:58.633 --> 01:24:01.302
THAT AS YOU DO THE LOCAL WORK AS

01:24:01.369 --> 01:24:03.104
YOU'RE FIGHTING FOR US OUT THERE --

01:24:03.171 --> 01:24:04.806
AT AND AT THE NATIONAL SIDE OF

01:24:04.873 --> 01:24:07.041
THINGS THAT WE CONTINUE TO

01:24:07.108 --> 01:24:09.077
PRESSURE THE LOCAL ARE DISTRICTS

01:24:09.144 --> 01:24:10.412
TO DO BETTER BY THESE VULNERABLE

01:24:10.478 --> 01:24:10.979
COMMUNITIES ARE GOING TO BE

01:24:11.045 --> 01:24:12.013
HEARING FROM.

01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:13.882
A COUPLE OF SPEAKERS TODAY ABOUT

01:24:13.948 --> 01:24:19.521
SOME OF THESE VULNERABLE

01:24:19.587 --> 01:24:22.056
COMMUNITIES AND I MAY CHANGE

01:24:22.123 --> 01:24:23.825
OTHER AFFECTED AND AND HOW

01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:24.492
THEY'RE AT A BIGGER THIS

01:24:24.559 --> 01:24:25.260
ADVANTAGE AND IN THESE CRISIS

01:24:25.326 --> 01:24:26.094
OUT THERE AND HOW WE NEED TO

01:24:26.161 --> 01:24:26.428
TAKE ACTION.

01:24:26.494 --> 01:24:28.029
QUICKER AND AND HAVE THE COURAGE

01:24:28.096 --> 01:24:28.730
HI SO I LOOK FORWARD TO ANY

01:24:28.797 --> 01:24:29.497
ADDITIONAL IDEAS YOU MIGHT HAVE

01:24:29.564 --> 01:24:30.932
FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO DO YOU IN

01:24:30.999 --> 01:24:32.033
TO HELP YOU A CHAMPION FOR SOME

01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:35.336
OF THOSE IDEAS. TO TO MOVE US

01:24:35.403 --> 01:24:37.105
TOWARD HER TWENTY FIFTY GOALS

01:24:37.172 --> 01:24:39.274
AND DO IT IN A WAY WHERE WE HELP

01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:41.943
THESE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE THE

01:24:42.010 --> 01:24:42.544
MOST DISADVANTAGED SOONER THAN

01:24:42.610 --> 01:24:43.111
LATER.

01:24:43.178 --> 01:24:44.846
THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH

01:24:44.913 --> 01:24:46.214
AND THEN I WOULD JUST ASK YOU TO

01:24:46.281 --> 01:24:48.783
STICK AROUND IN CASE WE HAVE

01:24:48.850 --> 01:24:50.351
MORE QUESTIONS LATER THANK YOU.

01:24:50.418 --> 01:24:50.952
THANK YOU.

01:24:51.019 --> 01:24:52.420
ON INTO NEXT UP WE ARE GOING TO

01:24:52.487 --> 01:24:54.856
HAVE A THREE PRESS CENTERS

01:24:54.923 --> 01:24:56.090
PERCENT TO A SIX ARE EXAMPLES OF

01:24:56.157 --> 01:24:57.425
SIGNIFICANT.

01:24:57.492 --> 01:24:58.660
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION PEGS

01:24:58.726 --> 01:24:59.928
IMPACTS ON VULNERABLE

01:24:59.994 --> 01:25:01.362
COMMUNITIES.

01:25:01.429 --> 01:25:03.398
AT WE ARE GOING TO BE STARTING

01:25:03.465 --> 01:25:04.766
WITH DOCTOR STEPHEN WHEELER

01:25:04.833 --> 01:25:08.036
PROFESSOR OF THE UNIVERSITY.

01:25:08.102 --> 01:25:16.010
OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS.

01:25:16.077 --> 01:25:18.146
GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU VERY

01:25:18.213 --> 01:25:19.481
MUCH FOR HAVING ME TODAY --

01:25:19.547 --> 01:25:21.683
PROFESSOR RULER LET ME GIVE YOU

01:25:21.749 --> 01:25:23.685
THIS A LITTLE BIT OF ACTUALLY TO

01:25:23.751 --> 01:25:25.820
FOR A START OKAY -- I THINK YOU

01:25:25.887 --> 01:25:26.488
FOR MAKING TIME OUT HERE MISTER

01:25:26.554 --> 01:25:27.922
WHEELER IS A PROFESSOR IN THE

01:25:27.989 --> 01:25:29.724
LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE PROGRAM.

01:25:29.791 --> 01:25:31.626
THE DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN ECOLOGY

01:25:31.693 --> 01:25:35.630
AT UC DAVIS -- AND HE IS -- HE'S

01:25:35.697 --> 01:25:37.632
THE AUTHOR OF THREE BOOKS

01:25:37.699 --> 01:25:39.000
PLANNING FOR SUSTAINABILITY

01:25:39.067 --> 01:25:40.468
TOWARDS CIVIL EQUITABLE AND

01:25:40.535 --> 01:25:43.771
ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES I AND HE

01:25:43.838 --> 01:25:45.006
WILL BE TALKING TO US TODAY

01:25:45.073 --> 01:25:47.909
ABOUT URBAN COMMUNITY SAID THIS

01:25:47.976 --> 01:25:49.010
EVENT IS A THANK YOU FOR MAKING

01:25:49.077 --> 01:25:49.711
TIME.

01:25:49.777 --> 01:25:51.012
YOU HAVE HIS BIO AND THEN SOME

01:25:51.079 --> 01:25:53.147
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OF THE

01:25:53.214 --> 01:25:54.015
LEADERSHIP THAT HE'S OUT THERE

01:25:54.082 --> 01:25:56.684
DOING -- IN THIS AREA BUT I I DO

01:25:56.751 --> 01:25:57.585
WANT TO THANK YOU FOR MAKING

01:25:57.652 --> 01:25:59.754
TIME AND I'M EXCITED TO HEAR

01:25:59.821 --> 01:26:03.057
YOUR COMMENTS TODAY THANK YOU.

01:26:03.124 --> 01:26:05.126
OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- I AM

01:26:05.193 --> 01:26:05.660
NOT GOING TO SPEAK ABOUT

01:26:05.727 --> 01:26:06.261
MEDICATION ALTHOUGH I AM VERY

01:26:06.327 --> 01:26:07.595
HAPPY TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS

01:26:07.662 --> 01:26:09.597
ABOUT THAT LATER I AM INSTEAD

01:26:09.664 --> 01:26:11.065
GOING TO TALK ABOUT HE IMPACT.

01:26:11.132 --> 01:26:12.800
ON VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND

01:26:12.867 --> 01:26:15.169
WAYS TO POSSIBLY REDUCE THOSE.

01:26:15.236 --> 01:26:18.039
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS I'VE

01:26:18.106 --> 01:26:19.841
DONE RESEARCH LOOKING AT URBAN

01:26:19.908 --> 01:26:20.875
HEAT ISLANDS.

01:26:20.942 --> 01:26:23.378
IN ARID AND SEMI ARID REGIONS

01:26:23.444 --> 01:26:24.512
WORLDWIDE.

01:26:24.579 --> 01:26:27.715
THIS TOPIC IS IMPORTANT TO

01:26:27.782 --> 01:26:29.417
CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE PLANNING.

01:26:29.484 --> 01:26:30.418
FOR REASONS THAT I THINK WE ALL

01:26:30.485 --> 01:26:31.619
KNOW OUR COMMUNITIES WILL GET

01:26:31.686 --> 01:26:32.987
HOTTER.

01:26:33.054 --> 01:26:34.789
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY HE WILL BE

01:26:34.856 --> 01:26:36.958
GREATER SOME PLACES THAN OTHERS.

01:26:37.025 --> 01:26:38.960
AND THEY WILL BE PUBLIC HEALTH

01:26:39.027 --> 01:26:41.062
IMPACT STAY WILL THERE WILL BE

01:26:41.129 --> 01:26:42.630
INCREASED MORTALITY VULNERABLE

01:26:42.697 --> 01:26:44.899
COMMUNITIES WILL SUFFER THE MOST

01:26:44.966 --> 01:26:47.001
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY PUBLIC

01:26:47.068 --> 01:26:48.403
POLICY PUT IN PLACE NOW.

01:26:48.469 --> 01:26:49.837
CAN POTENTIALLY REDUCE THESE

01:26:49.904 --> 01:26:53.474
IMPACTS SOMEWHAT AND DISPARITIES

01:26:53.541 --> 01:26:55.310
BETWEEN COMMUNITIES.

01:26:55.376 --> 01:26:57.512
NOW THE PHENOMENON OF URBAN HEAT

01:26:57.579 --> 01:26:59.981
ISLANDS.

01:27:00.048 --> 01:27:02.183
HAS GOTTEN A LOT OF PRESS IN THE

01:27:02.250 --> 01:27:03.551
LAST DECADE THIS IS THE FOR NOT

01:27:03.618 --> 01:27:04.619
WELL KNOWN PHENOMENA IN WHICH

01:27:04.686 --> 01:27:07.689
URBAN LANDSCAPES DOMINATED BY.

01:27:07.755 --> 01:27:09.657
ASPHALT AND ROOFTOPS.

01:27:09.724 --> 01:27:10.858
HEAT UP DURING THE DAY MORE

01:27:10.925 --> 01:27:12.560
STRONGLY THAN SURROUNDING RURAL

01:27:12.627 --> 01:27:13.528
REGIONS.%

01:27:13.595 --> 01:27:16.731
THIS IS NOT A NEW PHENOMENON IT

01:27:16.798 --> 01:27:18.499
HAS BEEN KNOWN ABOUT SINCE THE

01:27:18.566 --> 01:27:19.634
NINETEENTH CENTURY THERE'S BEEN.

01:27:19.701 --> 01:27:22.437
ACADEMIC STUDY SINCE NINETEEN

01:27:22.503 --> 01:27:23.538
SIXTIES.

01:27:23.605 --> 01:27:24.939
IT HAS INCREASED THOUGH QUITE A

01:27:25.006 --> 01:27:28.309
BIT AS COMMUNITIES RURAL URBAN

01:27:28.376 --> 01:27:30.378
REGIONS HAVE GROWN.

01:27:30.445 --> 01:27:32.146
IN TEMPERATE CLIMATES CITIES CAN

01:27:32.213 --> 01:27:34.282
BE FIVE TO TEN DEGREES

01:27:34.349 --> 01:27:36.818
FAHRENHEIT HOTTER ON A WARM

01:27:36.884 --> 01:27:38.252
SUMMER DAY.

01:27:38.319 --> 01:27:39.854
THEN SURROUNDING COUNTRYSIDE.

01:27:39.921 --> 01:27:42.323
BUT WHAT ISN'T AS WELL KNOWN IS

01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:44.359
THAT SOME NEIGHBORHOODS WITH IN

01:27:44.425 --> 01:27:46.661
BOTH CITIES AND SMALLER RURAL

01:27:46.728 --> 01:27:48.529
TOWNS.

01:27:48.596 --> 01:27:50.698
WE'LL BE MUCH HOTTER THAN OTHERS.

01:27:50.765 --> 01:27:53.868
MY OWN WORK HAS FOUND THAT ON A

01:27:53.935 --> 01:27:55.336
JULY DAY YOU THE HOTTEST BUILT

01:27:55.403 --> 01:27:56.838
LANDSCAPES WITH IN SACRAMENTO

01:27:56.904 --> 01:27:57.872
ARE.

01:27:57.939 --> 01:28:00.041
UP TO NINETY DEGREES HOTTER

01:28:00.108 --> 01:28:02.110
WARMER DâN COOLEST THE COOLEST

01:28:02.176 --> 01:28:03.678
NEIGHBORHOODS A PLACE LIKE A

01:28:03.745 --> 01:28:05.279
LONG FLOOR IN BOULEVARD WILL BE

01:28:05.346 --> 01:28:07.148
ABOUT. NINE DEGREES HOTTER THAN

01:28:07.215 --> 01:28:08.916
IN LAND PARK WHICH IS LESS THAN

01:28:08.983 --> 01:28:10.084
A MILE AWAY.

01:28:10.151 --> 01:28:11.786
THESE ARE SURFACE TEMPERATURES I

01:28:11.853 --> 01:28:13.755
SHOULD MENTION AIR TEMPERATURES

01:28:13.821 --> 01:28:16.591
WILL BE SOMEWHAT LESS OF A

01:28:16.658 --> 01:28:21.496
DIFFERENCE BUT STILL SIGNIFICANT.

01:28:21.562 --> 01:28:23.598
RESEARCHERS INITIALLY STUDIED

01:28:23.665 --> 01:28:25.600
URBAN HEAT ISLANDS IN TEMPERATE

01:28:25.667 --> 01:28:27.802
CITIES SUCH AS ATLANTA WHICH IS

01:28:27.869 --> 01:28:29.003
ONE OF THE CLASSIC.

01:28:29.070 --> 01:28:30.304
CASES.

01:28:30.371 --> 01:28:32.240
END WHEN YOU HAVE SURROUNDING

01:28:32.306 --> 01:28:33.908
RURAL AREAS THAT ARE HEAVILY

01:28:33.975 --> 01:28:34.909
FORESTED.

01:28:34.976 --> 01:28:36.477
THOSE STAY MUCH COOLER THAN THE

01:28:36.544 --> 01:28:38.913
CITY.

01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:41.249
MUCH MORE RECENTLY WE AT THOSE

01:28:41.315 --> 01:28:47.522
OF US IN ACADEMIA HAVE.

01:28:47.588 --> 01:28:50.258
END RECENT WORK HAS FOUND THAT.

01:28:50.324 --> 01:28:51.659
HEAT ISLANDS.

01:28:51.726 --> 01:28:53.361
IN THESE PLACES IS ARE MUCH MORE

01:28:53.428 --> 01:28:56.264
COMPLEX THAN FOR TRIAL AND THEN

01:28:56.330 --> 01:28:57.598
FOR TEMPERATURE.

01:28:57.665 --> 01:28:59.067
BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF

01:28:59.133 --> 01:29:02.637
VEGETATION DESERT AND OTHER DRY

01:29:02.704 --> 01:29:05.273
RURAL LANDSCAPES HEAT UP MUCH

01:29:05.339 --> 01:29:07.275
MORE RAPIDLY DURING THE DAY.

01:29:07.341 --> 01:29:09.310
ENDS BUT ALSO COOL DOWN MUCH

01:29:09.377 --> 01:29:13.881
MORE RAPIDLY AT NIGHT STAND

01:29:13.948 --> 01:29:15.249
DEMONSTRATED FOR EXAMPLE BY

01:29:15.316 --> 01:29:16.851
MADRID WHICH IS ON THE RIGHT

01:29:16.918 --> 01:29:19.187
HERE AT THE BLUE OBVIOUSLY ARC

01:29:19.253 --> 01:29:21.055
IS COOL AND THEN THE LEFT YOU

01:29:21.122 --> 01:29:22.890
SEE THERE IS WHAT'S CALLED AN

01:29:22.957 --> 01:29:24.325
URBAN COOL ISLAND DURING THE DAY.

01:29:24.392 --> 01:29:26.728
AND AT NIGHT WE HAVE AN URBAN

01:29:26.794 --> 01:29:29.831
HEAT ISLAND -- ENDS THESE

01:29:29.897 --> 01:29:31.432
PHENOMENA ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY

01:29:31.499 --> 01:29:33.334
ELEVATION HUMIDITY THE PRESENCE

01:29:33.401 --> 01:29:35.670
OF MOUNTAINS OCEANS AND OTHER.

01:29:35.737 --> 01:29:37.271
OTHER THINGS.

01:29:37.338 --> 01:29:39.974
SINCE URBAN HEAT ISLAND IN ARID

01:29:40.041 --> 01:29:41.409
REGIONS DO HAVE THIS COMPLEX

01:29:41.476 --> 01:29:43.177
NATURE.

01:29:43.244 --> 01:29:44.245
WE MAKES MOST SENSE IN

01:29:44.312 --> 01:29:47.648
CALIFORNIA TO JUST FOCUS ON HEAT.

01:29:47.715 --> 01:29:49.684
RATHER THAN HEAT ISLANDS PER SE.

01:29:49.751 --> 01:29:51.886
EVEN THOUGH HE ISLANDS DOES

01:29:51.953 --> 01:29:53.054
SOUND LIKE A TRENDY TOPIC.

01:29:53.121 --> 01:29:54.255
END TO LOOK AT POLICIES AND

01:29:54.322 --> 01:29:56.090
PROGRAMS TO REDUCE TEMPERATURES

01:29:56.157 --> 01:29:57.859
IN THE HOTTEST AND MOST

01:29:57.925 --> 01:29:59.861
VULNERABLE NEIGHBORHOODS.

01:29:59.927 --> 01:30:02.730
SO HERE IS A KEEP MAPPING OF THE

01:30:02.797 --> 01:30:04.065
LA BASIN [inaudible]

01:30:04.132 --> 01:30:05.900
END.

01:30:05.967 --> 01:30:08.269
WE CAN SEE THAT SOME AREAS ARE

01:30:08.336 --> 01:30:09.537
MUCH HARDER THAN OTHERS THE

01:30:09.604 --> 01:30:11.439
COAST OBVIOUSLY IS USUALLY

01:30:11.506 --> 01:30:11.672
COOLER.

01:30:11.739 --> 01:30:15.843
OF WE HAVE SOME INTERESTING

01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:17.712
PHENOMENA AT NIGHT IT LOOKS LIKE

01:30:17.779 --> 01:30:18.913
THERE IS A BIT OF A HEAT ISLAND

01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:20.348
IN THE LONG BEACH AREA.

01:30:20.414 --> 01:30:21.849
I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT IS IT

01:30:21.916 --> 01:30:23.618
COULD BE SOMETHING TO DO WITH

01:30:23.684 --> 01:30:26.888
PREVAILING WINDS OR NEARBY

01:30:26.954 --> 01:30:28.222
INDUSTRIAL AREAS OR WHATEVER

01:30:28.289 --> 01:30:28.523
[inaudible]

01:30:28.589 --> 01:30:30.858
A BUNCH.

01:30:30.925 --> 01:30:32.593
OUR GOAL IN THE FUTURE I THINK

01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:33.928
HE'S GOING TO NEED TO BE TO

01:30:33.995 --> 01:30:36.497
UNDERSTAND THESE DYNAMICS AND TO

01:30:36.564 --> 01:30:38.132
NOT JUST DO A ONE DAY MAPPING

01:30:38.199 --> 01:30:39.600
BUT TO MODEL IT THROUGHOUT THE

01:30:39.667 --> 01:30:42.203
YEAR. TO IDENTIFY THE AREAS THAT

01:30:42.270 --> 01:30:43.604
ARE REALLY HOTTER.

01:30:43.671 --> 01:30:44.772
THAN OTHERS IN NEIGHBORHOODS

01:30:44.839 --> 01:30:48.876
THAT ARE AT MOST RISK OF HEAT.

01:30:48.943 --> 01:30:49.510
TO OVERLAY THAT WITH THE NASCENT

01:30:49.577 --> 01:30:50.912
NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE MOST

01:30:50.978 --> 01:30:53.514
VULNERABLE BECAUSE OF POVERTY OR

01:30:53.581 --> 01:30:56.851
BECAUSE OF PRESENCE OF ELDERLY

01:30:56.918 --> 01:30:58.619
OR VERY YOUNG POPULATIONS OR

01:30:58.686 --> 01:30:59.153
OTHER.

01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:01.823
VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND THEN

01:31:01.889 --> 01:31:04.325
DEVELOP STRATEGIES.

01:31:04.392 --> 01:31:06.093
TO REDUCE THE RISK -- IN SUCH

01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:08.062
ANALYSES CAN BE DONE FOR BOTH

01:31:08.129 --> 01:31:11.732
RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES.

01:31:11.799 --> 01:31:13.668
SO HE'S HAS PARTICULAR IMPACTS

01:31:13.734 --> 01:31:16.437
ON DISADVANTAGED POPULATIONS.

01:31:16.504 --> 01:31:18.039
HOUSEHOLDS WITHOUT GOOD AIR

01:31:18.105 --> 01:31:19.540
CONDITIONING OR EVAPORATIVE

01:31:19.607 --> 01:31:21.909
COOLERS WHICH IS TO SAY MANY LOW

01:31:21.976 --> 01:31:23.044
INCOME HOUSEHOLDS.

01:31:23.110 --> 01:31:24.545
HAVE LITTLE RELIEF FROM HIGH

01:31:24.612 --> 01:31:29.951
TEMPERATURES EVEN AT NIGHT --

01:31:30.017 --> 01:31:31.619
PROLONGED HEAT IS HARD ON THE

01:31:31.686 --> 01:31:33.254
ELDERLY AND OTHERS IN POOR

01:31:33.321 --> 01:31:34.822
HEALTH LEADING TO INCREASED

01:31:34.889 --> 01:31:36.224
MORTALITY.

01:31:36.290 --> 01:31:38.192
PROLONGED HEAT CAN ALSO BE HARD

01:31:38.259 --> 01:31:40.261
ON THE VERY YOUNG.

01:31:40.328 --> 01:31:41.863
I SPEAK FROM SOME PERSONAL

01:31:41.929 --> 01:31:43.397
EXPERIENCE ON THIS SINCE MY

01:31:43.464 --> 01:31:44.899
DAUGHTER SENT SUFFERED FROM

01:31:44.966 --> 01:31:46.868
FEBRILE SEIZURES I II

01:31:46.934 --> 01:31:48.769
CONVULSIONS THAT OCCUR BECAUSE

01:31:48.836 --> 01:31:50.371
OF HIGH BODY TEMPERATURES.

01:31:50.438 --> 01:31:53.241
WHICH ARE MOST COMMON BETWEEN

01:31:53.307 --> 01:31:55.209
SIX MONTHS AND FIVE YEARS OF AGE.

01:31:55.276 --> 01:31:57.745
DURING THE TWO THOUSAND THREE

01:31:57.812 --> 01:31:59.981
HEAT WAVE IN FRANCE WHICH IS

01:32:00.047 --> 01:32:01.349
WHAT THE GRAPH YOUR SHOWS.

01:32:01.415 --> 01:32:02.950
SOME FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE

01:32:03.017 --> 01:32:04.418
DIED PREMATURELY AND I THINK THE

01:32:04.485 --> 01:32:06.287
NUMBER FOR EUROPE AS A WHOLE WAS

01:32:06.354 --> 01:32:07.922
CLOSER.

01:32:07.989 --> 01:32:08.422
TO SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND

01:32:08.489 --> 01:32:09.690
PROBABLY THE CURRENT EUROPEAN

01:32:09.757 --> 01:32:11.492
HEAT WAVE WILL HAVE SIMILAR

01:32:11.559 --> 01:32:12.693
RESULTS.

01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:13.928
AND YOU SEE THE MORTALITY GOES

01:32:13.995 --> 01:32:15.897
UP OVER TIME IS PEOPLE'S

01:32:15.963 --> 01:32:17.164
RESILIENCE.

01:32:17.231 --> 01:32:19.467
WAS DOWN AFTER AN EXTENDED

01:32:19.533 --> 01:32:22.169
PERIOD OF HEAT. TO DATE THERE

01:32:22.236 --> 01:32:23.404
HAVE BEEN FEW IF ANY

01:32:23.471 --> 01:32:25.907
NEIGHBORHOOD SCALE STUDIES

01:32:25.973 --> 01:32:28.242
QUANTIFYING THE DISPROPORTIONATE

01:32:28.309 --> 01:32:29.977
KEEP RELATED CLIMATE RISK.

01:32:30.044 --> 01:32:31.512
FACED BY DISADVANTAGED

01:32:31.579 --> 01:32:33.581
CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES.

01:32:33.648 --> 01:32:35.349
I HOPE TO UNDERTAKE. ONE SUCH

01:32:35.416 --> 01:32:36.851
STUDY THIS FALL WITH ONE OF MY

01:32:36.918 --> 01:32:39.287
GRADUATE STUDENTS AND MAYBE NEXT

01:32:39.353 --> 01:32:39.887
YEAR WE WILL HAVE SOME BETTER

01:32:39.954 --> 01:32:40.988
DATA.

01:32:41.055 --> 01:32:43.491
HOWEVER WE DO ALREADY KNOW THAT

01:32:43.557 --> 01:32:45.026
THESE COMMUNITIES WILL BE

01:32:45.092 --> 01:32:47.094
VULNERABLE.

01:32:47.161 --> 01:32:50.364
SO HOW DO WE KEEP CALIFORNIA

01:32:50.431 --> 01:32:51.899
NEIGHBORHOODS COOL.

01:32:51.966 --> 01:32:53.367
THERE ARE BASICALLY THREE MAIN

01:32:53.434 --> 01:32:55.636
STRATEGIES. TO MAXIMIZE

01:32:55.703 --> 01:32:58.673
VEGETATION ESPECIALLY AT LARGE

01:32:58.739 --> 01:33:00.908
DROUGHT TOLERANT SHADE TREES. TO

01:33:00.975 --> 01:33:02.877
MAKE SERVICES SUCH AS ROOFS AND

01:33:02.944 --> 01:33:05.212
PAVING REFLECT RATHER THAN

01:33:05.279 --> 01:33:06.647
ABSORB HEAT.

01:33:06.714 --> 01:33:08.916
AND TO USE BUILDING FORM

01:33:08.983 --> 01:33:11.319
TRELLISES AWNINGS AND OTHER

01:33:11.385 --> 01:33:14.088
DESIGN STRATEGY. TO PRODUCE

01:33:14.155 --> 01:33:15.656
SHADE FOR PEOPLE AT GROUND LEVEL.

01:33:15.723 --> 01:33:17.325
THE STATE CAN PLAY A ROLE IN

01:33:17.391 --> 01:33:19.927
HELPING ALL THREE STRATEGIES

01:33:19.994 --> 01:33:21.529
COME ABOUT AND IT ALREADY DOES

01:33:21.595 --> 01:33:23.497
IN SOME WAY.

01:33:23.564 --> 01:33:24.699
SO LET'S TAKE THE FIRST OF THOSE.

01:33:24.765 --> 01:33:27.101
GREENING COMMUNITIES IS NOT

01:33:27.168 --> 01:33:28.736
SIMPLE IN A DRY CLIMATE.

01:33:28.803 --> 01:33:30.604
ALTHOUGH THE COOL AIR THROUGH IF

01:33:30.671 --> 01:33:32.540
APPLE TRANSPIRATION LAWNS ARE

01:33:32.606 --> 01:33:34.542
USUALLY NOT DESIRABLE SINCE THEY

01:33:34.608 --> 01:33:36.911
REQUIRE EXTENSIVE IRRIGATION.

01:33:36.978 --> 01:33:39.013
AND DON'T PRODUCE SHAPE.

01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:40.281
SHAPE PRODUCING TREES ARE A MUCH

01:33:40.348 --> 01:33:41.615
BETTER STRATEGY.

01:33:41.682 --> 01:33:43.084
THE CHALLENGE IS TO IDENTIFY

01:33:43.150 --> 01:33:44.585
SPECIES.

01:33:44.652 --> 01:33:46.854
THAT WILL MAXIMIZE SHADING WHILE

01:33:46.921 --> 01:33:48.589
MINIMIZING WATER USE.

01:33:48.656 --> 01:33:50.124
END TOLERATING HARSH CONDITIONS

01:33:50.191 --> 01:33:52.727
THAT OFTEN OCCUR ALONG STREETS

01:33:52.793 --> 01:33:54.395
AND IN PARKING LOTS.

01:33:54.462 --> 01:33:56.330
THERE ARE USEFUL DATABASES THAT

01:33:56.397 --> 01:33:57.698
HAVE ALREADY BEEN DEVELOPED.

01:33:57.765 --> 01:33:59.066
THROUGH THE UNIVERSITY OF

01:33:59.133 --> 01:34:00.234
CALIFORNIA DIVISION OF

01:34:00.301 --> 01:34:01.936
AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL

01:34:02.003 --> 01:34:03.771
RESOURCES.

01:34:03.838 --> 01:34:04.939
THIS CALL THAT WILL CALLS

01:34:05.006 --> 01:34:06.340
DATABASE DON'T ASK ME TO

01:34:06.407 --> 01:34:08.676
REMEMBER WHAT IT STANDS -- FOR

01:34:08.743 --> 01:34:10.978
END THROUGH CAL POLY SAN LUIS

01:34:11.045 --> 01:34:13.280
OBISPO IT'S CALLED THE SELECT

01:34:13.347 --> 01:34:15.216
THREE DATABASE.

01:34:15.282 --> 01:34:16.851
SOME OF THE STATE UTILITIES AND

01:34:16.917 --> 01:34:19.053
MUNICIPALITIES HAVE ALSO TAKEN

01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:20.421
LEADERSHIP IN PROMOTING URBAN

01:34:20.488 --> 01:34:21.655
FORESTRY.

01:34:21.722 --> 01:34:23.224
MANY CITIES ARE NOW REQUIRING

01:34:23.290 --> 01:34:25.426
DEVELOPERS TO PLANT TREES IN

01:34:25.493 --> 01:34:26.527
PARKING LOTS.

01:34:26.594 --> 01:34:29.263
SO THAT AT LEAST 50% OF ASPHALT

01:34:29.330 --> 01:34:31.198
SURFACES WE'LL BE SHADED IN TEN

01:34:31.265 --> 01:34:32.900
YEARS.

01:34:32.967 --> 01:34:34.769
CITIES COULD ALSO DEVELOP STREET

01:34:34.835 --> 01:34:37.471
TREE PROGRAMS THAT WOULD SHAPE

01:34:37.538 --> 01:34:38.973
STREETS A SIMILAR AMOUNT.

01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:40.975
AND COULD ADOPT SUBDIVISION

01:34:41.042 --> 01:34:42.843
CODES FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT.

01:34:42.910 --> 01:34:44.445
THAT WOULD REQUIRE NARROWER

01:34:44.512 --> 01:34:47.148
STREETS WITH LESS ASPHALT.

01:34:47.214 --> 01:34:48.949
AND MORE EXTENSIVE SHADING.

01:34:49.016 --> 01:34:50.584
POTENTIALLY THE STATE COULD

01:34:50.651 --> 01:34:53.554
ENCOURAGE OR REQUIRE SUCH STEPS.

01:34:53.621 --> 01:34:55.289
THE STATE HAS PROVIDED FUNDING

01:34:55.356 --> 01:34:56.424
THROUGH WHICH URBAN GREENING

01:34:56.490 --> 01:34:59.794
PROGRAM AND OTHER PROGRAMS. FOR

01:34:59.860 --> 01:35:01.462
URBAN FORESTRY WHICH COULD BE

01:35:01.529 --> 01:35:04.799
INCREASED IN THE FUTURE AS WELL.

01:35:04.865 --> 01:35:06.167
MOVING ON TO THE SECOND TOPIC

01:35:06.233 --> 01:35:07.635
CALIFORNIA HAS ALREADY MADE

01:35:07.701 --> 01:35:10.271
STRIDES TOWARD REQUIRING COOL

01:35:10.337 --> 01:35:11.772
ROOFS IN PART DUE TO THE

01:35:11.839 --> 01:35:13.941
LEADERSHIP OF LATE C. C.

01:35:14.008 --> 01:35:16.510
COMMISSIONER ART ROSENFELDT.

01:35:16.577 --> 01:35:17.778
THE STATE'S BUILDING CODE NOW

01:35:17.845 --> 01:35:19.647
REQUIRES ROOFING MATERIALS TO

01:35:19.713 --> 01:35:21.348
HAVE RELATIVELY HIGH LEVELS OF

01:35:21.415 --> 01:35:22.817
REFLECTANCE.

01:35:22.883 --> 01:35:24.418
WHICH CAN BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT

01:35:24.485 --> 01:35:25.786
NECESSARILY MAKING SHINGLES

01:35:25.853 --> 01:35:28.989
WHITE OR EVEN LIGHT COLORED.

01:35:29.056 --> 01:35:31.025
STREET SERVICES HAVE NOT

01:35:31.092 --> 01:35:32.893
RECEIVED SO MUCH ATTENTION.

01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:34.128
HOWEVER CANOGA PARK IS

01:35:34.195 --> 01:35:35.796
EXPERIMENTING WITH LIGHT COLORED

01:35:35.863 --> 01:35:37.131
ASPHALT THAT HAS HIGHER

01:35:37.198 --> 01:35:38.799
REFLECTANCE.

01:35:38.866 --> 01:35:40.301
AND THE STATE PERHAPS COULD

01:35:40.367 --> 01:35:42.503
ACCELERATE EFFORTS ON THIS FRONT

01:35:42.570 --> 01:35:44.505
AS WELL.

01:35:44.572 --> 01:35:46.540
THE THIRD STRATEGY USING BUILT

01:35:46.607 --> 01:35:48.576
FORM.

01:35:48.642 --> 01:35:50.211
TO CREATE SHADE IS THE LEAST

01:35:50.277 --> 01:35:52.046
EXPLORED TO DATE.

01:35:52.113 --> 01:35:53.714
AND LET ME MOVE ON TO THE NEXT

01:35:53.781 --> 01:35:53.914
LINE.

01:35:53.981 --> 01:35:57.251
OF MEDITERRANEAN AND LATIN

01:35:57.318 --> 01:35:59.320
AMERICAN CITIES HAVE USED THE

01:35:59.386 --> 01:36:01.055
STRATEGY FOR CENTURIES.

01:36:01.122 --> 01:36:02.790
HOWEVER IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE

01:36:02.857 --> 01:36:04.825
OFTEN CREATED LOW SPREAD OUT

01:36:04.892 --> 01:36:07.628
BUILT LANDSCAPES WITH LITTLE IF

01:36:07.695 --> 01:36:09.663
ANY SHADE FOR PEDESTRIANS.

01:36:09.730 --> 01:36:11.165
MUNICIPALITIES COULD REQUIRE NEW

01:36:11.232 --> 01:36:13.000
BUILDINGS PARTICULARLY IN

01:36:13.067 --> 01:36:15.136
CENTRAL LOCATIONS. TO BE AT

01:36:15.202 --> 01:36:16.737
LEAST TWO OR THREE STORIES SO

01:36:16.804 --> 01:36:18.439
THAT THEY CAST A SIGNIFICANT

01:36:18.506 --> 01:36:19.840
AMOUNT OF SHADE.

01:36:19.907 --> 01:36:21.775
AND THE COULD REQUIRE AWNINGS

01:36:21.842 --> 01:36:24.278
WERE PORTICOS OVERSIGHT WALKS.

01:36:24.345 --> 01:36:26.347
COURTYARDS ARE ALSO DESIRABLE

01:36:26.413 --> 01:36:27.515
WITHIN LARGE BUILDINGS.

01:36:27.581 --> 01:36:29.416
SINCE THEY ALMOST ALWAYS HAVE AT

01:36:29.483 --> 01:36:31.385
LEAST ONE SIDE IN SHADE AND

01:36:31.452 --> 01:36:33.120
CREATE RELATIVELY COOL OUTDOOR

01:36:33.187 --> 01:36:34.788
MICRO CLIMATES FOR BUILDING

01:36:34.855 --> 01:36:36.190
RESIDENTS.

01:36:36.257 --> 01:36:37.858
THE STATE MIGHT ENCOURAGE SUCH

01:36:37.925 --> 01:36:40.060
DESIGN STRATEGIES AS WELL AS

01:36:40.127 --> 01:36:41.829
PASSIVE SOLAR ARCHITECTURE IN

01:36:41.896 --> 01:36:42.963
GENERAL WHICH WOULD KEEP

01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:45.566
BUILDINGS COOL WITHOUT EXCESSIVE

01:36:45.633 --> 01:36:47.768
AIR CONDITIONING USE.

01:36:47.835 --> 01:36:49.670
THROUGH THESE THREE AREAS URBAN

01:36:49.737 --> 01:36:51.338
FORESTRY REFLECTIVE ROOF AND

01:36:51.405 --> 01:36:53.407
PAVING MATERIALS AND SHAPE

01:36:53.474 --> 01:36:54.542
PRODUCING BUILT FORM.

01:36:54.608 --> 01:36:56.210
BOTH LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS

01:36:56.277 --> 01:36:57.545
IN CALIFORNIA MIGHT TAKE

01:36:57.611 --> 01:37:00.848
INITIATIVE TO REDUCE HEAT RISKS.

01:37:00.915 --> 01:37:03.050
AT RISK LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS

01:37:03.117 --> 01:37:04.885
COULD RECEIVE SPECIAL PRIORITY

01:37:04.952 --> 01:37:06.287
WITHIN SUCH PROGRAMS.

01:37:06.353 --> 01:37:08.489
THE END RESULT.

01:37:08.556 --> 01:37:10.891
WE'LL BE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES

01:37:10.958 --> 01:37:13.194
BOTH RURAL AND URBAN THAT STAY

01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:15.462
COOLER DURING THE NEXT CENTURY.

01:37:15.529 --> 01:37:17.131
BY HAVING MORE CONTINUOUS.

01:37:17.198 --> 01:37:18.432
TREE CANOPIES.

01:37:18.499 --> 01:37:21.535
COOLER ROOFS AND PAVED SURFACES.

01:37:21.602 --> 01:37:23.103
AND MORE GROUND LEVEL SHADE

01:37:23.170 --> 01:37:24.939
CREATED BY BUILDINGS AND SHADE

01:37:25.005 --> 01:37:26.540
STRUCTURES AND LET ME EMPHASIZE

01:37:26.607 --> 01:37:28.342
AGAIN THIS CAN HAPPEN FOR SMALL

01:37:28.409 --> 01:37:30.945
TOWNS AND RURAL PLACES AS WELL

01:37:31.011 --> 01:37:31.845
AS CITIES.

01:37:31.912 --> 01:37:33.047
SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR INVITING

01:37:33.113 --> 01:37:34.481
ME TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY AND I

01:37:34.548 --> 01:37:35.449
WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

01:37:35.516 --> 01:37:40.254
QUESTIONS.

01:37:40.321 --> 01:37:45.226
AT THANK YOU DOCTOR MILLER -- SO.

01:37:45.292 --> 01:37:46.961
WHEELER ACTUALLY WIENER.

01:37:47.027 --> 01:37:49.863
MY APOLOGIES -- IT'S CORRECT IN

01:37:49.930 --> 01:37:53.234
MY THE PAPER -- SAID I MEAN THE

01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:54.468
THE PROMISES THAT.

01:37:54.535 --> 01:37:55.736
CLIMATE CHANGE IS GOING TO

01:37:55.803 --> 01:37:57.538
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF HEAT

01:37:57.605 --> 01:37:58.405
WAVES WE'RE GONNA HAVE LONGER

01:37:58.472 --> 01:37:59.807
HEAT WAVES.

01:37:59.873 --> 01:38:03.077
AND COMMUNITIES -- THAT ARE

01:38:03.143 --> 01:38:04.845
ALREADY DISADVANTAGE ARE GONNA.

01:38:04.912 --> 01:38:06.413
BE THAT MUCH MORE IMPACTED ALONG

01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:07.581
THE WAY.

01:38:07.648 --> 01:38:09.450
HAVE YOU HAVE HAS YOUR RESEARCH

01:38:09.516 --> 01:38:11.652
LOOKED A LITTLE BAR CLOSELY

01:38:11.719 --> 01:38:13.721
SPECIFICALLY AT THAT CONNECTION

01:38:13.787 --> 01:38:15.990
WITH GHGS SHE WITH REDUCTIONS

01:38:16.056 --> 01:38:17.992
MEDICATION -- AND IF SO CAN YOU

01:38:18.058 --> 01:38:19.593
GIVE ME A LITTLE MORE SPECIFICS

01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:21.328
ON THAT.

01:38:21.395 --> 01:38:23.264
OKAY I HAVE LOOKED TO SEPARATELY

01:38:23.330 --> 01:38:25.666
AT MITIGATION STRATEGIES FOR

01:38:25.733 --> 01:38:26.667
GREENHOUSE GASES.

01:38:26.734 --> 01:38:28.168
AND IN PARTICULAR I HAVE DONE

01:38:28.235 --> 01:38:29.870
SOME WORK WITH.

01:38:29.937 --> 01:38:31.372
DAN KAMIN AND CHRIS JONES WHO

01:38:31.438 --> 01:38:33.073
ARE AT UC BERKELEY.

01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:34.675
AROUND.

01:38:34.742 --> 01:38:35.776
CONSUMPTION BASED EMISSIONS OF

01:38:35.843 --> 01:38:37.378
THERE IS.

01:38:37.444 --> 01:38:38.746
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS DONE

01:38:38.812 --> 01:38:40.547
WONDERFUL WORK IN TERMS OF

01:38:40.614 --> 01:38:42.216
CLIMATE MITIGATION PLANNING.

01:38:42.283 --> 01:38:44.118
BUT THERE IS AN ELEPHANT IN THE

01:38:44.184 --> 01:38:45.986
ROOM ON THAT.

01:38:46.053 --> 01:38:48.188
ONE WHICH IS THAT WE DO NOT YET

01:38:48.255 --> 01:38:49.490
HAVE A GOOD WAY.

01:38:49.556 --> 01:38:51.325
OF INCLUDING EMISSIONS THAT

01:38:51.392 --> 01:38:53.360
RESULT FROM OUR CONSUMPTION

01:38:53.427 --> 01:38:56.497
STUFF WE BUY AND STUFF WE EAT.

01:38:56.563 --> 01:38:58.332
AND A LOT OF THOSE EMISSIONS ARE

01:38:58.399 --> 01:39:00.367
IN EFFECT EXPORTED TO CHINA OR

01:39:00.434 --> 01:39:01.468
OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD

01:39:01.535 --> 01:39:01.769
[inaudible]

01:39:01.835 --> 01:39:03.737
SO.

01:39:03.804 --> 01:39:05.339
ACTUAL CALIFORNIA MISSIONS ARE

01:39:05.406 --> 01:39:08.542
PROBABLY 30% HIGHER THAN WHAT WE

01:39:08.609 --> 01:39:11.245
NOW -- ARE TALKING ABOUT.

01:39:11.312 --> 01:39:13.847
IN THE LONG RUN I THINK PROBABLY

01:39:13.914 --> 01:39:15.683
THE MORE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH

01:39:15.749 --> 01:39:17.651
WILL BE TO GET THOSE IN IN SOME

01:39:17.718 --> 01:39:19.753
WAYS THAT INCLUDES DIET VERY

01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:21.522
MUCH AS WELL AS HOUSEHOLD

01:39:21.588 --> 01:39:23.090
PURCHASES.

01:39:23.157 --> 01:39:24.491
AND IT ALSO INCLUDES THINGS LIKE

01:39:24.558 --> 01:39:26.560
AIR TRAVEL WHICH ARE NOT WILL

01:39:26.627 --> 01:39:27.328
INCORPORATED CURRENTLY

01:39:27.394 --> 01:39:27.628
[inaudible]

01:39:27.695 --> 01:39:31.932
END -- IT WILL REQUIRE SOCIAL

01:39:31.999 --> 01:39:34.068
MARKETING CAMPAIGNS TO MAKE THE

01:39:34.134 --> 01:39:35.869
PUBLIC AWARE OF THE IMPACT OF

01:39:35.936 --> 01:39:37.304
THESE THINGS.

01:39:37.371 --> 01:39:38.939
IT WILL REQUIRE BETTER.

01:39:39.006 --> 01:39:40.240
PROCESS SEES OF FIGURING OUT

01:39:40.307 --> 01:39:42.509
EMBODIED EMISSIONS IN PRODUCT.

01:39:42.576 --> 01:39:43.877
OF THINGS THAT WE BUY AND

01:39:43.944 --> 01:39:45.245
CONSUME.

01:39:45.312 --> 01:39:46.847
THAT IS COMING ALONG QUITE

01:39:46.914 --> 01:39:51.652
RAPIDLY -- END IT WILL REQUIRE --

01:39:51.719 --> 01:39:53.287
LOT OF EDUCATION AND POLITICAL

01:39:53.354 --> 01:39:54.355
MESSAGING.

01:39:54.421 --> 01:39:56.924
WHICH I THINK WE ARE NOT YET

01:39:56.990 --> 01:39:58.359
REALLY.

01:39:58.425 --> 01:40:01.195
OF BEGINNING TO GET INTO.

01:40:01.261 --> 01:40:03.764
THANK YOU BEFORE -- I PROCEED I

01:40:03.831 --> 01:40:05.632
DO WANT TO LIE TO HAVE SENATOR

01:40:05.699 --> 01:40:06.834
WITH SO HERE WITH US.

01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:08.435
A TWO DAY AND BEFORE I ASK MY

01:40:08.502 --> 01:40:09.803
NEXT QUESTION DO YOU HAVE.

01:40:09.870 --> 01:40:12.639
ANY QUESTION YOURSELF FOR DOCTOR

01:40:12.706 --> 01:40:16.777
MILLER.

01:40:16.844 --> 01:40:20.848
AT OKAY THANK YOU -- IN THE LOST

01:40:20.914 --> 01:40:22.216
MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT HERE BUT I

01:40:22.282 --> 01:40:24.818
ME MYSELF AND OUT.

01:40:24.885 --> 01:40:32.760
UP ABOUT THIS SHOOT.

01:40:32.826 --> 01:40:33.894
I'LL GO AHEAD AND JUST UP.

01:40:33.961 --> 01:40:36.397
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL OFTENTIMES.

01:40:36.463 --> 01:40:37.064
ENTRIES IN THE GROUND IS NOT THE

01:40:37.131 --> 01:40:39.032
CHALLENGE IS KEEPING THEM ALIVE.

01:40:39.099 --> 01:40:42.102
AND WHEN YOU GO TO RESIDENTS AND

01:40:42.169 --> 01:40:44.171
ASK THEM TO PARTNER.

01:40:44.238 --> 01:40:46.407
WITH YOU AND SAY WE'LL GIVE YOU

01:40:46.473 --> 01:40:47.841
A FREE TRIP TO CREATE A WATER IT

01:40:47.908 --> 01:40:49.910
MOST PEOPLE WHILE.

01:40:49.977 --> 01:40:51.311
MOST PEOPLE WON'T AGREE TO THAT

01:40:51.378 --> 01:40:52.646
IT'S VERY INTERESTING SOME WILL

01:40:52.713 --> 01:40:54.415
SOME WALTON THAT PRESENTS

01:40:54.481 --> 01:40:57.418
CHALLENGES AND THE OTHER ISSUE.

01:40:57.484 --> 01:40:59.119
IS AS HAVING TO DO WITH -- ARE

01:40:59.186 --> 01:41:00.954
DWINDLING FOREST ESPECIALLY IN

01:41:01.021 --> 01:41:02.156
THE SOUTH.

01:41:02.222 --> 01:41:03.257
WE'VE HAD WILD FIRES IN

01:41:03.323 --> 01:41:05.826
CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE DECIMATED --

01:41:05.893 --> 01:41:07.428
PINE FORESTS.

01:41:07.494 --> 01:41:09.963
IN THE AREAS OF KIND THE

01:41:10.030 --> 01:41:12.666
HIGHLANDS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:41:12.733 --> 01:41:12.966
[inaudible]

01:41:13.033 --> 01:41:19.072
SCIENTISTS HAVE -- OF HAVE

01:41:19.139 --> 01:41:19.373
[inaudible]

01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:21.608
PROGNOSTICATOR THAT.

01:41:21.675 --> 01:41:22.709
THESE TREES WILL NEVER RECOVER

01:41:22.776 --> 01:41:24.745
NATURALLY [inaudible]

01:41:24.812 --> 01:41:28.782
AND WHICH ONE WOULDN'T.

01:41:28.849 --> 01:41:30.083
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IT'S HARD TO

01:41:30.150 --> 01:41:32.286
GET THESE TREES ADOPTED IN

01:41:32.352 --> 01:41:34.021
COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE

01:41:34.087 --> 01:41:34.321
[inaudible]

01:41:34.388 --> 01:41:36.256
LOW VEGETATION.

01:41:36.323 --> 01:41:38.192
AND IN OUR FORESTS WERE HAVING A

01:41:38.258 --> 01:41:42.930
HARD TIME REINTRODUCING -- A

01:41:42.996 --> 01:41:43.931
DENT IN NOT REGRET JUST

01:41:43.997 --> 01:41:46.733
REPLACING FORCE THAT WE'VE LOST

01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:47.034
[inaudible]

01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:49.770
AND AND YOU KNOW WHEN I'VE WHEN

01:41:49.837 --> 01:41:52.606
I'VE -- STUDIED HISTORY.

01:41:52.673 --> 01:41:55.242
IN FIFTEEN EN I'M SORRY AND YES

01:41:55.309 --> 01:41:57.044
OF FIFTEEN FORTY TWO WHAT WHEN

01:41:57.110 --> 01:41:59.346
CUANDO REDISCOVERY OF SAILED UP

01:41:59.413 --> 01:42:01.248
THE CALIFORNIA COAST.

01:42:01.315 --> 01:42:04.184
HE FOUND OF MONTEREY PINES.

01:42:04.251 --> 01:42:05.853
OFF THE COAST OF GATORADE --

01:42:05.919 --> 01:42:08.856
NEGATIVE WHICH IS MADE PENINSULA

01:42:08.922 --> 01:42:10.791
BAJA CALIFORNIA.

01:42:10.858 --> 01:42:13.026
NOW THE ONLY MONTEREY PINES THAT

01:42:13.093 --> 01:42:13.994
EXIST ARE OUT SOME ISLANDS

01:42:14.061 --> 01:42:15.496
CALDWELL BALANCE AND THAT'S KIND

01:42:15.562 --> 01:42:17.064
OF A REMNANT OF A VERY LUSH

01:42:17.130 --> 01:42:18.832
FORESTS THAT USED TO BE COASTAL

01:42:18.899 --> 01:42:20.000
FORCED.

01:42:20.067 --> 01:42:20.901
AND WE'RE LOSING THAT LITTLE BY

01:42:20.968 --> 01:42:22.836
LITTLE [inaudible]

01:42:22.903 --> 01:42:24.972
HAVE YOU.

01:42:25.038 --> 01:42:27.074
CONSIDER THAT IN YOUR IN YOUR

01:42:27.140 --> 01:42:29.510
STUDIES HOW DO WE COMBAT.

01:42:29.576 --> 01:42:31.879
THE THE THE CONTINUE DOES THIS

01:42:31.945 --> 01:42:32.112
EFFORT.

01:42:32.179 --> 01:42:34.147
DESERT IF THE CATION.

01:42:34.214 --> 01:42:36.083
OF OUR STATE.

01:42:36.149 --> 01:42:37.518
I MEAN WHEN WE LOOK AT CLIMATE

01:42:37.584 --> 01:42:40.687
CHANGE S. IS VERY HARSH.

01:42:40.754 --> 01:42:43.056
ON PINE WOOD FORESTS.

01:42:43.123 --> 01:42:45.692
AND WHEN I LOOK AT OF THE NATIVE

01:42:45.759 --> 01:42:46.927
SPECIES OF CALIFORNIA THOUGH

01:42:46.994 --> 01:42:48.462
COASTAL LIVE OAK.

01:42:48.529 --> 01:42:49.863
EVEN THOSE ARE THREATEN ACROSS

01:42:49.930 --> 01:42:52.065
OUR STATE.

01:42:52.132 --> 01:42:54.301
WHAT DO WE WHAT DO WE INTRODUCE

01:42:54.368 --> 01:42:55.936
IN OUR COMMUNITIES TO REPLACE

01:42:56.003 --> 01:42:58.739
WHAT IS NATIVE?

01:42:58.805 --> 01:43:02.309
THAT IS A VERY GOOD QUESTION.

01:43:02.376 --> 01:43:04.111
THERE ARE MULTIPLE ANSWERS TO

01:43:04.177 --> 01:43:05.345
THAT WHAT HAPPENS IN THE

01:43:05.412 --> 01:43:06.813
MOUNTAIN FORCE IS GOING TO BE

01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:08.615
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT HAPPENS IN

01:43:08.682 --> 01:43:08.815
URBAN.

01:43:08.882 --> 01:43:11.718
STREETS.

01:43:11.785 --> 01:43:13.620
WE MAY NEED TO GET AWAY FROM.

01:43:13.687 --> 01:43:16.089
NATIVE.

01:43:16.156 --> 01:43:17.257
I AM A BIGOT IS BIG A FAN AS

01:43:17.324 --> 01:43:19.927
ANYONE OF NATIVE LANDSCAPES BUT

01:43:19.993 --> 01:43:21.628
LET'S FACE IT IN THE FUTURE.

01:43:21.695 --> 01:43:22.996
THEY WILL BE DIFFERENT AND WE

01:43:23.063 --> 01:43:25.832
MAY NEED TO LOOK AT PLACES LIKE

01:43:25.899 --> 01:43:28.268
AUSTRALIA TO LOOK FOR DROUGHT

01:43:28.335 --> 01:43:30.037
TOLERANT SPECIES THAT WILL WORK

01:43:30.103 --> 01:43:31.271
HERE NOW.

01:43:31.338 --> 01:43:32.506
IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY A LOT

01:43:32.573 --> 01:43:34.241
OF EUCALYPTUS WERE IMPORTED FROM

01:43:34.308 --> 01:43:35.943
AUSTRALIA AND WE DON'T WANT TO

01:43:36.009 --> 01:43:37.511
REPEAT THAT THAT DID NOT.

01:43:37.578 --> 01:43:39.212
ALWAYS WORK WELL BUT THERE MAY

01:43:39.279 --> 01:43:41.348
BE OTHER SPECIES THAT.

01:43:41.415 --> 01:43:42.916
COULD WORK AND WE NEED TO BE

01:43:42.983 --> 01:43:45.218
EXTREMELY CAREFUL ABOUT

01:43:45.285 --> 01:43:47.020
TRANSPORTING SPECIES ANYWHERE.

01:43:47.087 --> 01:43:48.522
BUT LET'S FACE IT OUR CLIMATE

01:43:48.589 --> 01:43:50.490
MAY BE CLOSER TO THE WEST COAST

01:43:50.557 --> 01:43:52.359
OF AUSTRALIA IN FIFTY YEARS DâN

01:43:52.426 --> 01:43:53.961
IT WILL BE TO WHAT CALIFORNIA

01:43:54.027 --> 01:43:58.732
USED TO BE -- LA HAD A MILLION

01:43:58.799 --> 01:44:02.135
TREE PROGRAM THAT BEGAN IN TWO

01:44:02.202 --> 01:44:04.371
THOUSAND SIX THAT ARM.

01:44:04.438 --> 01:44:07.808
HAD MIXED SUCCESS AND DID NOT

01:44:07.874 --> 01:44:09.543
ACHIEVE ANYTHING LIKE A MILLION

01:44:09.610 --> 01:44:10.243
TREES AS FAR AS I KNOW.

01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:15.582
OF THEY SOMETHING'S WORKED WELL

01:44:15.649 --> 01:44:17.417
BUT THEY CHOSE SOME SPECIES THAT

01:44:17.484 --> 01:44:18.652
DID REQUIRE.

01:44:18.719 --> 01:44:19.820
A FAIR BIT WATER.

01:44:19.886 --> 01:44:21.288
AND THOSE DIDN'T WORK.

01:44:21.355 --> 01:44:22.789
SO WE NEED TO BE A LITTLE MORE

01:44:22.856 --> 01:44:25.092
JUDICIOUS ABOUT WHICH PIECES WE

01:44:25.158 --> 01:44:27.260
ACTUALLY CHOOSE.

01:44:27.327 --> 01:44:30.263
OF WE MAY NEED.

01:44:30.330 --> 01:44:31.598
TO LOOK AT ST DESIGNED

01:44:31.665 --> 01:44:33.934
DIFFERENTLY SO THAT THE RUNOFF

01:44:34.001 --> 01:44:35.402
FROM STREETS AND PARKING LOTS.

01:44:35.469 --> 01:44:37.804
IS HELD LOCALLY FOR THE TREES.

01:44:37.871 --> 01:44:39.573
AND PERHAPS EVEN GRAY WATER FROM

01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:42.009
BUILDINGS-- WE MAY WANT TO

01:44:42.075 --> 01:44:43.744
THINK HOLISTICALLY ABOUT WATER

01:44:43.810 --> 01:44:46.613
SYSTEMS SO THAT WE USE EVERY

01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:47.714
DROP THAT WE HAVE MORE

01:44:47.781 --> 01:44:49.116
EFFECTIVELY AND WE USE IT AND

01:44:49.182 --> 01:44:51.018
REUSE IT [inaudible] FOR

01:44:51.084 --> 01:44:52.452
VEGETATION [inaudible]

01:44:52.519 --> 01:44:57.658
OF BUT IN SOME CASES.

01:44:57.724 --> 01:44:58.825
WE MAY NOT HAVE THAT MUCH

01:44:58.892 --> 01:45:00.060
VEGETATION I USED TO WORK IN

01:45:00.127 --> 01:45:02.095
STATE OF NEW MEXICO WHICH IS

01:45:02.162 --> 01:45:04.131
MORE ARID IN MANY PLACES THAT

01:45:04.197 --> 01:45:06.767
CALIFORNIA -- THERE ARE NO LARGE

01:45:06.833 --> 01:45:07.901
NATIVE TREE SPECIES [inaudible]

01:45:07.968 --> 01:45:09.736
IN.

01:45:09.803 --> 01:45:11.171
ALBUQUERQUE WHERE I USED TO LIVE

01:45:11.238 --> 01:45:13.440
OUTSIDE OF THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY

01:45:13.507 --> 01:45:14.708
WHICH IS.

01:45:14.775 --> 01:45:16.610
A UNIQUE CASE.

01:45:16.677 --> 01:45:19.913
SO IS A BIG QUESTION WHAT WE DO --

01:45:19.980 --> 01:45:21.815
NOW THERE THERE DEFINITELY ARE

01:45:21.882 --> 01:45:22.983
SOME DESERT SPECIES THAT HAVE

01:45:23.050 --> 01:45:23.884
THAT TAKE VERY LITTLE WATER.

01:45:23.950 --> 01:45:26.953
THE USUALLY AREN'T AS DEEP AS

01:45:27.020 --> 01:45:29.790
SHAPE BUT THE DE ELEMENTARY.

01:45:29.856 --> 01:45:31.525
THEY ARE USEFUL AND THAT'S WHERE

01:45:31.591 --> 01:45:32.559
THE BILL FOR CONSENT TO WE NEED

01:45:32.626 --> 01:45:34.161
TO CREATE CHAIRED IN COMMUNITIES%

01:45:34.227 --> 01:45:35.328
AND IN A PLACES THE

01:45:35.395 --> 01:45:39.032
MEDITERRANEAN HAVE KNOWN THIS

01:45:39.099 --> 01:45:39.933
FOR MILLENNIA.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:40.901
BUT WE NEED TO RETHINK THE LOOK

01:45:40.967 --> 01:45:42.536
AND FEEL PERHAPS OF CALIFORNIA

01:45:42.602 --> 01:45:43.270
TOWNS.

01:45:43.336 --> 01:45:44.838
A BIT IN ORDER TO BE COMFORTABLE

01:45:44.905 --> 01:45:49.509
AND HEALTHY.

01:45:49.576 --> 01:45:51.244
THANK YOU -- MY LAST QUESTION

01:45:51.311 --> 01:45:53.246
WAS WE WERE LOOKING AT RURAL

01:45:53.313 --> 01:45:57.551
VERSUS URBAN COMMUNITIES AND HE

01:45:57.617 --> 01:46:00.053
HE THEIR LANDS.

01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:02.055
ARE THERE RECOMMENDATIONS OF I

01:46:02.122 --> 01:46:05.559
THESE RECOMMENDATIONS SIMILAR --

01:46:05.625 --> 01:46:07.994
TO FIGHT THE IMPACTS FOR A ROLE

01:46:08.061 --> 01:46:08.862
AND ARE BETTER THE HAVE SET

01:46:08.929 --> 01:46:09.996
SEPARATE STRATEGIES THAT YOU

01:46:10.063 --> 01:46:12.766
RECOMMEND.

01:46:12.833 --> 01:46:19.573
WELL IN MANY ARE THE SAME --

01:46:19.639 --> 01:46:21.174
OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE SOME

01:46:21.241 --> 01:46:23.310
ACTIVITIES SUCH AS FARM WORK IN

01:46:23.376 --> 01:46:25.212
RURAL AREAS THAT WILL HAVE

01:46:25.278 --> 01:46:26.513
PARTICULAR NEEDS. TO PROTECT

01:46:26.580 --> 01:46:28.849
FARMWORKERS AND THAT DOESN'T

01:46:28.915 --> 01:46:32.119
HAPPEN IN URBAN PLACES -- BUT AS

01:46:32.185 --> 01:46:34.121
FAR AS THE TOWNS THEMSELVES.

01:46:34.187 --> 01:46:34.955
YOU KNOW THE IT'S THE SAME

01:46:35.021 --> 01:46:36.389
CHALLENGE.

01:46:36.456 --> 01:46:37.958
HOW DO YOU KEEP?

01:46:38.024 --> 01:46:39.259
PEOPLE'S DWELLINGS COMFORTABLE

01:46:39.326 --> 01:46:40.894
PEOPLE'S TRAVEL OUTDOORS

01:46:40.961 --> 01:46:45.465
COMFORTABLE -- SO IT'S NOT

01:46:45.532 --> 01:46:47.367
RADICALLY DIFFERENT.

01:46:47.434 --> 01:46:49.169
I WILL MENTION ONE OTHER THING

01:46:49.236 --> 01:46:50.871
ON MEDICATION I DO TEACH LAND

01:46:50.937 --> 01:46:53.039
USE PLANNING AND TRANSPORTATION

01:46:53.106 --> 01:46:54.908
PLANNING AND THE OTHER ONE OTHER

01:46:54.975 --> 01:46:56.810
BIG PIECE OF THE MEDICATION

01:46:56.877 --> 01:46:58.078
PICTURE THAT HASN'T WORKED RULES

01:46:58.145 --> 01:47:00.313
WELL SO FAR IS SB.

01:47:00.380 --> 01:47:04.484
THREE SEVENTY FIVE AND ONE OF

01:47:04.551 --> 01:47:06.052
THE STUDIES HAS NOT WHERE IT HAS

01:47:06.119 --> 01:47:08.522
NOT WORKED -- BASICALLY LOCAL

01:47:08.588 --> 01:47:08.989
METROPOLITAN PLANNING

01:47:09.055 --> 01:47:11.224
ORGANIZATIONS HAVE OFTEN SIMPLY

01:47:11.291 --> 01:47:12.592
REBRANDED THEIR EXISTING

01:47:12.659 --> 01:47:13.994
REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLAN AS

01:47:14.060 --> 01:47:15.762
A SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PLAN

01:47:15.829 --> 01:47:16.863
WITHOUT REALLY THINKING IT

01:47:16.930 --> 01:47:17.898
THROUGH.

01:47:17.964 --> 01:47:19.332
WHAT ALL THE DIFFERENT

01:47:19.399 --> 01:47:20.834
DIMENSIONS OF THAT WOULD BE?

01:47:20.901 --> 01:47:24.571
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS WE KNOW

01:47:24.638 --> 01:47:27.207
THEM DON'T HAVE. TO COMPLY WITH

01:47:27.274 --> 01:47:30.443
THE REGIONAL PLANS THAT ARE DONE

01:47:30.510 --> 01:47:33.480
IN TERMS OF LAND USE -- SO THE

01:47:33.547 --> 01:47:34.014
COMPLAINTS HAS BEEN PRETTY

01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:35.115
SPOTTY.

01:47:35.182 --> 01:47:37.551
SO I THINK WE NEED SOMETHING --

01:47:37.617 --> 01:47:39.052
SECOND GENERATION ON THAT WHICH

01:47:39.119 --> 01:47:41.354
GOES QUITE A BIT FURTHER

01:47:41.421 --> 01:47:41.655
[inaudible]

01:47:41.721 --> 01:47:44.791
INFILL DEVELOPMENT. FOR PLACES

01:47:44.858 --> 01:47:47.360
THAT LEAD TO WERE YOU CAN LEAVE

01:47:47.427 --> 01:47:49.196
A LOW CARBON LIFESTYLE.

01:47:49.262 --> 01:47:52.232
DOES PRODUCE PRETTY GOOD RESULTS

01:47:52.299 --> 01:47:54.267
IN TERMS OF REDUCING EMISSIONS.

01:47:54.334 --> 01:47:55.869
IF YOU DO IT IN OUTLYING TOWNS

01:47:55.936 --> 01:47:57.571
THAT.

01:47:57.637 --> 01:47:59.406
WHERE IT'S NOT SO EASY TO LIVE

01:47:59.472 --> 01:48:02.075
WITHOUT A CAR OR WITHOUT RICK

01:48:02.142 --> 01:48:04.010
LONG DISTANCE COMMUTING?

01:48:04.077 --> 01:48:05.712
IT DOESN'T MATTER AS MUCH BUT WE

01:48:05.779 --> 01:48:06.913
DO WANT INFILL TO HAPPEN AND WE

01:48:06.980 --> 01:48:08.248
NEED SOME MORE INCENTIVES FOR IT

01:48:08.315 --> 01:48:09.549
TO HAPPEN AND WE NEED IT TO

01:48:09.616 --> 01:48:11.051
HAPPEN WITHOUT GENTRIFICATION

01:48:11.117 --> 01:48:13.253

CAMPAIGNS PROJECTS PLANS.

01:50:01.661 --> 01:50:04.531
INITIATIVES -- DEVELOPMENT OF

01:50:04.597 --> 01:50:06.466
PROJECTS WE WE COME FROM A PLACE

01:50:06.533 --> 01:50:08.501
WHERE WE USE A RESEARCH AND

THE CLASS.

01:50:22.615 --> 01:50:25.318
ALMOST TWENTY YEARS SO WE ARE

01:50:25.385 --> 01:50:27.287
VERY FAMILIAR WITH AB MONITORED.

01:50:27.354 --> 01:50:29.823
AND SO WHEN YOU START TALK ABOUT

01:50:29.889 --> 01:50:31.558
THESE CONTAMINATIONS THAT'S THE

01:50:31.624 --> 01:50:34.294
NEW ONE ONE PART OF THE PROBLEMS

01:50:34.361 --> 01:50:36.363
THIS HAPPENED TO WES OKLA.

01:50:36.429 --> 01:50:40.400
CAM ERICA FOUNDATIONS AIR TALKS

01:50:40.467 --> 01:50:42.302
OF POLLUTION THIS ONE PARK WE

01:50:42.369 --> 01:50:45.038
HAVE A MULTIPLE PRAWN PROBLEM

01:50:45.105 --> 01:50:52.178
WITH WITH -- WITH.

01:50:52.245 --> 01:50:54.547
CLIMATE CHANGE AND CRIME AND

01:50:54.614 --> 01:50:56.049
JUSTICE IN WEST OAKLAND.

01:50:56.116 --> 01:50:58.351
SO IS NOT JUST ONE BANK IS A

01:50:58.418 --> 01:50:59.853
MULTIPLE THINGS AND WE CANNOT

01:50:59.919 --> 01:51:01.287
THIS CANNOT TALK ABOUT.

01:51:01.354 --> 01:51:03.423
AB AIR POLLUTION BASED ON THE

01:51:03.490 --> 01:51:04.824
FACT THAT WE LIVE.

01:51:04.891 --> 01:51:08.094
WE LIVE IN A A COMMUNITY OF

01:51:08.161 --> 01:51:09.229
WHERE THEIR SUPPORT AND THERE'S

01:51:09.295 --> 01:51:11.631
EXPANSIONS OF THAT PORT.

01:51:11.698 --> 01:51:14.667
THAT HAS IMPACTED WEST OAKLAND

01:51:14.734 --> 01:51:16.703
FOR VOTE OVER EIGHTY YEARS THAT

01:51:16.770 --> 01:51:19.672
WE AND I'M MORE RECENTLY -- WE

01:51:19.739 --> 01:51:21.574
FAMILY AFTER TWENTY YEARS GOT

01:51:21.641 --> 01:51:23.576
THE TO THE PLACE WHERE THERE ARE

01:51:23.643 --> 01:51:26.880
IN A PLAN OF DOING ZERO EIGHT

01:51:26.946 --> 01:51:28.982
MISSIONS.

01:51:29.049 --> 01:51:30.617
AFTER TWENTY SEVEN YEARS.

01:51:30.683 --> 01:51:33.887
OUT SO IT'S NOT JUST ONE THING

01:51:33.953 --> 01:51:35.789
IS A MULTIPLE THINGS WE HAVE TO

01:51:35.855 --> 01:51:37.257
DEAL WITH INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:51:37.323 --> 01:51:39.659
ISSUES -- WE HAVE INDOOR AIR

01:51:39.726 --> 01:51:41.995
QUALITY ISSUES WE HAVE

01:51:42.062 --> 01:51:45.765
TRANSPORTATION ISSUES -- OF OF A

01:51:45.832 --> 01:51:47.434
IMPACTS THEM THEN WE ALSO HAVE

01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:49.502
TO LOOK AT ENFORCEMENT.

01:51:49.569 --> 01:51:51.971
LAND USE PROXIMITY AND EXPOSURE

01:51:52.038 --> 01:51:53.306
AND LOCAL REGULATIONS THAT DO

01:51:53.373 --> 01:51:54.541
NOT.

01:51:54.607 --> 01:51:58.144
SEEM TO MEET UP WITH OUR STATE

01:51:58.211 --> 01:51:59.913
REGULATIONS SO IS NOT THIS IS A

01:51:59.979 --> 01:52:01.948
MULTIPLE PRONG ISSUE FOR WONDER

01:52:02.015 --> 01:52:02.615
COMMUNITY.

01:52:02.682 --> 01:52:04.284
ABOUT TWENTY ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT

01:52:04.350 --> 01:52:05.351
THOUSAND PEOPLE BECAUSE WE HAVE

01:52:05.418 --> 01:52:08.388
A MULTIPLE LEVELS OF IMPACTS.

01:52:08.455 --> 01:52:10.457
SO IS THIS NOT THE POLLUTION

01:52:10.523 --> 01:52:11.858
ISSUE WAS NOT LIKELY AT AIR

01:52:11.925 --> 01:52:15.195
TOXIC CONTAMINATION IS ALSO THAT

01:52:15.261 --> 01:52:16.996
LIKE A STATE INFRASTRUCTURE IS

01:52:17.063 --> 01:52:18.364
EXPOSURE IS LAND USE.

01:52:18.431 --> 01:52:21.534
AND OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAVEN'T

01:52:21.601 --> 01:52:24.104
A MULTI PLANT MOST WILL PROMPT

01:52:24.170 --> 01:52:26.272
PLANT UP ENGAGEMENT OF COMMUNITY

01:52:26.339 --> 01:52:29.843
ENGAGEMENT SO THE COMMUNITY HAVE

01:52:29.909 --> 01:52:31.711
A BOWEL.

01:52:31.778 --> 01:52:33.513
EIGHT VALUE ROLE IN DEVELOPING

01:52:33.580 --> 01:52:36.616
THE OWN THEIR OWN STRATEGIES

01:52:36.683 --> 01:52:38.885
THAT BASICALLY THAT WE SEE AS A

01:52:38.952 --> 01:52:45.158
COMMUNITY THAT WILL BENEFIT US.

01:52:45.225 --> 01:52:46.593
AT NOT JUST COLD BEEN APPROVED

01:52:46.659 --> 01:52:48.228
BUT THE BENEFITS BUT NOT THE

01:52:48.294 --> 01:52:49.562
HELP HARM.

01:52:49.629 --> 01:52:51.631
SO I WOULD LIKE TO JUST SAY THAT

01:52:51.698 --> 01:53:01.674
WE HAVE THE ISSUE OF JUST.

01:53:01.741 --> 01:53:05.445
LOOKING AT POLLUTION AND

01:53:05.512 --> 01:53:07.480
CONTAMINATION IS JUST ONE PART

01:53:07.547 --> 01:53:09.415
OF A PUZZLE THAT SUPPORT THAT

01:53:09.482 --> 01:53:10.850
THIS ONE COMMUNITY NEEDS.

01:53:10.917 --> 01:53:14.254
I HAVE AND HAVE BEEN ONGOING FOR

01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:14.821
OVER.

01:53:14.888 --> 01:53:22.662
IN MY TIME I'VE BEEN AS AS AS A

01:53:22.729 --> 01:53:24.764
CITY WIDE IF.

01:53:24.831 --> 01:53:27.066
THEY HAVE WHAT YOU CALL THE

01:53:27.133 --> 01:53:28.868
CLIMATE ACTION PLAN.

01:53:28.935 --> 01:53:31.604
AND NOW HIS CHANGES TO FROM --

01:53:31.671 --> 01:53:34.274
FROM THAT ENERGY ACTION PLAY OF

01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:36.409
THE WEAPON IN THE PLAN IN HIS

01:53:36.476 --> 01:53:37.177
ACTUAL PLAN THEY HAVE TO IT

01:53:37.243 --> 01:53:38.478
WOULD BE ACTUAL PLAN.

AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS

02:10:58.183 --> 02:11:00.185
THAT.

02:11:00.252 --> 02:11:02.020

THESE THIS IS ABSOLUTELY

02:15:41.266 --> 02:15:42.400
NECESSARY IF WE'RE GOING TO MEET

OF THE MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY

02:15:56.348 --> 02:15:58.083
IMPACTED COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT

02:15:58.149 --> 02:16:00.185
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA --

02:16:00.252 --> 02:16:01.586
ACCORDING CALAMARI SCREEN

02:16:01.653 --> 02:16:03.088
SOLUTIONS MUST MEANINGFULLY

02:16:03.154 --> 02:16:05.757
ADDRESS AGRICULTURAL AND AT AN

INDUSTRIAL EMISSIONS AND RURAL

02:16:08.860 --> 02:16:09.394
AREAS LIKE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN

02:16:09.461 --> 02:16:10.428
VALLEY.

02:16:10.495 --> 02:16:11.630
I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT

02:16:11.696 --> 02:16:13.598
ABOUT TO COMMUNITIES THAT I WORK

02:16:13.665 --> 02:16:16.535
WITH -- ALONG SIDE AND REPRESENT

02:16:16.601 --> 02:16:18.203
AND THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY --

02:16:18.270 --> 02:16:19.571
THE FIRST COMMUNITY IT'S CALLED

02:16:19.638 --> 02:16:22.040
TO REBEL IT'S AN TO LARRY COUNTY

02:16:22.107 --> 02:16:23.942
IT'S A COMMUNITY OF SEVENTY SIX

02:16:24.009 --> 02:16:25.143
HOMES.

02:16:25.210 --> 02:16:26.244
JUST.

02:16:26.311 --> 02:16:28.813
ABOUT A MILE EAST OF EXETER AND

02:16:28.880 --> 02:16:30.749
IT SITS AT THE BASE OF THE

02:16:30.815 --> 02:16:32.984
FOOTHILLS -- IN THE CENTRAL

02:16:33.051 --> 02:16:34.853
SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS AND

02:16:34.920 --> 02:16:36.321
IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT AT ACTUALLY

02:16:36.388 --> 02:16:38.223
AT THE END OF THE STREETS TO THE

02:16:38.290 --> 02:16:39.925
FRANK CURRENT CAN NOW.

02:16:39.991 --> 02:16:41.259
IT'S A LOW INCOME COMMUNITY

02:16:41.326 --> 02:16:43.862
WITHIN AN ESTIMATED MHI OF ABOUT

02:16:43.929 --> 02:16:44.462
TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS

02:16:44.529 --> 02:16:45.363
PER YEAR.

02:16:45.430 --> 02:16:47.098
AND THE COMMUNITY HAS STRUGGLED

02:16:47.165 --> 02:16:48.633
WITH DRINKING WATER QUALITY AND

02:16:48.700 --> 02:16:50.802
QUANTITY ISSUES FOR DECADES --

02:16:50.869 --> 02:16:52.771
INCLUDING CONTAMINATION FROM

02:16:52.837 --> 02:16:55.440
NITRATE HEXAVALENT CHROMIUM --

02:16:55.507 --> 02:16:58.109
AND MOST RECENTLY SALINITY WHICH

02:16:58.176 --> 02:16:59.878
HAS CAUSED PROBLEMS WITH A FEW

02:16:59.945 --> 02:17:01.880
THINGS I'LL GET -- TO GIVEN

02:17:01.947 --> 02:17:03.381
PROXIMITY TO THE SIERRA

02:17:03.448 --> 02:17:05.083
FOOTHILLS WHICH OBVIOUSLY GIVE

02:17:05.150 --> 02:17:06.885
VERY DRY IN THE SUMMER -- THERE

02:17:06.952 --> 02:17:08.920
IS EXTREME VIRUS SCAN IN THE

02:17:08.987 --> 02:17:11.122
COMMUNITY OF TO REBEL AND VERY

02:17:11.189 --> 02:17:13.024
LOW FIRE FLOW SO WHEN YOU FOR

02:17:13.091 --> 02:17:15.460
TALKING ABOUT FIRE PROTECTION.

02:17:15.527 --> 02:17:16.061
THE FIRE FLOW JUST ISN'T THERE

02:17:16.127 --> 02:17:17.729
FOR THAT.

02:17:17.796 --> 02:17:18.763
I INTENTIONALLY HIGH

02:17:18.830 --> 02:17:20.332
TEMPERATURES IN THE CM A SUMMER

02:17:20.398 --> 02:17:22.100
AND TO THE BILL SOMETIMES EXCEED

02:17:22.167 --> 02:17:23.535
OFTEN EXCEED.

02:17:23.602 --> 02:17:26.304
A HUNDRED AND TEN DEGREES -- ANA

02:17:26.371 --> 02:17:29.507
WITH AN AVERAGE OF BEFORE

02:17:29.574 --> 02:17:30.108
NINETEEN NINETY FOUR OF THESE

02:17:30.175 --> 02:17:31.977
HIGH HEAT DAYS PER YEAR BUT

02:17:32.043 --> 02:17:32.911
CALIDAD.

02:17:32.978 --> 02:17:34.179
PREDICTS THAT WE'RE GONNA SEE

02:17:34.245 --> 02:17:37.248
MORE LIKE FORTY SIX TO EIGHTY

02:17:37.315 --> 02:17:39.050
HIGH HEAT THE DAYS AND TO A BILL.

02:17:39.117 --> 02:17:42.253
BY TWENTY SEVENTY SO THE PROBLEM

02:17:42.320 --> 02:17:42.821
IS GOING TO GET A WHOLE LOT

02:17:42.887 --> 02:17:43.288
WORSE.

02:17:43.355 --> 02:17:44.956
MOST RESIDENTS DO NOT HAVE AIR

02:17:45.023 --> 02:17:46.257
CONDITIONING INTO REBEL AND

02:17:46.324 --> 02:17:49.260
INSTEAD RELY ON SWAMP COOLERS --

02:17:49.327 --> 02:17:50.495
ANYBODY THAT USED A SWAMP COOLER

02:17:50.562 --> 02:17:51.563
KNOWS THAT THAT START GETTING

02:17:51.630 --> 02:17:53.198
LESS AND LESS EFFECTIVE AS THAT

02:17:53.264 --> 02:17:54.966
TEMPERATURE RISES.

02:17:55.033 --> 02:17:56.701
AND EDITION OF THAT PROBLEM --

02:17:56.768 --> 02:17:58.670
INTO REBEL THE SALINITY IN THE

02:17:58.737 --> 02:18:00.138
WATER IS CLOGGING UP THOSE SMALL

02:18:00.205 --> 02:18:01.573
COOLER SO THEY DON'T EVEN

02:18:01.640 --> 02:18:03.341
FUNCTION AS WELL AS THEY

02:18:03.408 --> 02:18:06.611
OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE --

02:18:06.678 --> 02:18:09.848
ADDITIONALLY. TWO WE WILL AS

02:18:09.914 --> 02:18:11.149
EXCEEDED STATE AND WHAT THE

02:18:11.216 --> 02:18:13.385
SALINITY ISSUE -- AND THEN THE

02:18:13.451 --> 02:18:15.587
LOW PRESSURE ISSUE ALSO IMPACTS

02:18:15.654 --> 02:18:17.122
THE SWAMP COOLERS IN A WAY THAT

02:18:17.188 --> 02:18:18.890
MAKES IT NOT FUNCTION VERY WELL.

02:18:18.957 --> 02:18:19.991
THE COMMUNITY ALSO HAS TO DEAL

02:18:20.058 --> 02:18:21.326
WITH HIGH AGRICULTURAL EMISSIONS

02:18:21.393 --> 02:18:24.496
FROM NEARBY ORANGE ORCHARDS AND

02:18:24.562 --> 02:18:26.031
THOSE INCLUDE AND AS WE KNOW PM

02:18:26.097 --> 02:18:30.235
TWO POINT FIVE PM TEN PESTICIDES

02:18:30.301 --> 02:18:31.803
AND NOT TRUE NATURES OXIDE.

02:18:31.870 --> 02:18:32.437
PESTICIDE PROBLEMS OF GOT MORE

02:18:32.504 --> 02:18:34.005
SEVERE AS HIGH HEAT DAYS AND

02:18:34.072 --> 02:18:35.640
WARM NIGHTS HAVE BECOME MORE

02:18:35.707 --> 02:18:36.741
COMMON.

02:18:36.808 --> 02:18:38.243
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT AND I

02:18:38.309 --> 02:18:39.044
COMMUNITY AND IN MANY

02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:40.345
COMMUNITIES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN

02:18:40.412 --> 02:18:42.380
VALLEY TO LEAVE WINDOWS OPEN AT

02:18:42.447 --> 02:18:43.515
NIGHT BECAUSE OF POOR AIR

02:18:43.581 --> 02:18:44.382
QUALITY.

02:18:44.449 --> 02:18:47.385
IT'S ALSO DIFFICULT FOR FOLKS.

02:18:47.452 --> 02:18:48.753
TO KEEP THEIR SWAMP COOLERS AND

02:18:48.820 --> 02:18:49.988
IF THEY'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE

02:18:50.055 --> 02:18:52.057
AIR CONDITIONING.

02:18:52.123 --> 02:18:52.657
RUNNING AT NIGHT FOR THE SAME

02:18:52.724 --> 02:18:54.292
REASONS -- TO REVEAL IS

02:18:54.359 --> 02:18:55.760
APPROXIMATELY LIKE I SAID A MILE

02:18:55.827 --> 02:18:57.762
FROM THE CITY OF EXETER AND THAT

02:18:57.829 --> 02:18:58.963
MEANS THAT THEY'RE SUFFICIENT

02:18:59.030 --> 02:19:00.432
DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO REBEL ANNEX

02:19:00.498 --> 02:19:02.267
THERE THAT THE COOLING CENTERS

02:19:02.333 --> 02:19:03.334
IN EXETER.

02:19:03.401 --> 02:19:06.438
ARE -- IMPRACTICAL TO ACCESS FOR

02:19:06.504 --> 02:19:08.006
FOLKS WITHOUT CARS AND THAT'S

02:19:08.073 --> 02:19:09.441
MANY IN THE COMMUNITY.

02:19:09.507 --> 02:19:12.110
SO THERE'S ALSO TRANSPORTATION

02:19:12.177 --> 02:19:13.211
ASPECT TO THIS.

02:19:13.278 --> 02:19:14.679
MOST OF THESE ISSUES ARE NOT

02:19:14.746 --> 02:19:16.081
READILY APPARENT JUST FROM

02:19:16.147 --> 02:19:18.016
LOOKING AT STATE DATA SOURCES

02:19:18.083 --> 02:19:19.851
LIKE CALLUM IRIS SCREEN. FOR

02:19:19.918 --> 02:19:22.187
EXAMPLE CALAVERAS DURING --

02:19:22.253 --> 02:19:23.421
SHOWS TO LEGALIZE WITHIN A

02:19:23.488 --> 02:19:25.090
CENSUS TRACT THAT STOP FORTIETH

02:19:25.156 --> 02:19:26.891
PERCENTILE -- IT'S LUMPED IN

02:19:26.958 --> 02:19:27.959
WITH A BIG PORTION OF THIS YEAR

02:19:28.026 --> 02:19:29.761
AS AND IT DOESN'T CAPTURE A

02:19:29.828 --> 02:19:33.965
COMMUNITY AS SMALL AS TO EGO --

02:19:34.032 --> 02:19:34.766
SO STATE LEVEL POLLS LIKE

02:19:34.833 --> 02:19:35.300
CALABAR FIRE SCREEN WHILE

02:19:35.366 --> 02:19:37.102
PROVIDING VERY CRITICAL

02:19:37.168 --> 02:19:39.070
INFORMATION OR LOOKING AT THESE

02:19:39.137 --> 02:19:40.638
PROBLEMS ON A SENSE OF SCALE

02:19:40.705 --> 02:19:42.474
OFTEN OVERLOOKED COMMUNITIES

02:19:42.540 --> 02:19:43.842
LIKE TO THE BILL.

02:19:43.908 --> 02:19:45.076
DUE TO THEIR SMALL SIZE COMPARED

02:19:45.143 --> 02:19:47.312
AT SUCH A SIZE OF THE CENSUS

02:19:47.378 --> 02:19:49.481
TRACT -- TO LEGAL THAT'S

02:19:49.547 --> 02:19:50.782
HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR LOCAL

02:19:50.849 --> 02:19:51.950
PLANNING AND MEANINGFUL

02:19:52.016 --> 02:19:53.384
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT TO ENSURE

02:19:53.451 --> 02:19:55.086
THAT CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND

02:19:55.153 --> 02:19:56.554
RESILIENCY EFFORTS.

02:19:56.621 --> 02:19:58.389
ARE TAILORED TO SPECIFIC

02:19:58.456 --> 02:20:00.291
COMMUNITIES AND ACTUALLY ADDRESS

02:20:00.358 --> 02:20:01.826
THE ISSUES ON THE GROUND IN

02:20:01.893 --> 02:20:02.994
THOSE COMMUNITIES.

02:20:03.061 --> 02:20:05.163
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO EVEN

02:20:05.230 --> 02:20:06.831
IDENTIFY WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE

02:20:06.898 --> 02:20:07.899
LITTLE ON SOLVE THOSE PROBLEMS

02:20:07.966 --> 02:20:09.701
AT AND LESS WE ACTUALLY GO TO

02:20:09.768 --> 02:20:10.668
COMMUNITIES.

02:20:10.735 --> 02:20:13.037
MEETING FULLY ENGAGE RESIDENTS

02:20:13.104 --> 02:20:18.009
AND IDENTIFY SOLUTIONS BASED ON

02:20:18.076 --> 02:20:19.644
THE CIRCUMSTANCES ON THE GROUND.

02:20:19.711 --> 02:20:20.278
A SIMILAR SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES

02:20:20.345 --> 02:20:22.180
IS PROVIDED BY THE COMMUNITIES

02:20:22.247 --> 02:20:23.248
OF CAN'T TO A CREE CANNOT

02:20:23.314 --> 02:20:24.015
PORTMAN HERE.

02:20:24.082 --> 02:20:27.352
IN WESTERN FRESNO COUNTY BOTH

02:20:27.418 --> 02:20:28.620
COMMUNITY IS OUR IMMEDIATELY

02:20:28.686 --> 02:20:32.524
ADJACENT AND ABOUT AN HOUR -- TO

02:20:32.590 --> 02:20:33.758
THE WEST OF THE CITY OF FRESNO.

02:20:33.825 --> 02:20:34.826
BOTH ARE A LITTLE LOW INCOME

02:20:34.893 --> 02:20:36.561
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR.

02:20:36.628 --> 02:20:37.629
AND BOTH HAVE STRUGGLED WITH

02:20:37.695 --> 02:20:39.230
POOR WATER QUALITY.

02:20:39.297 --> 02:20:40.331
AIR QUALITY AND LACK OF

02:20:40.398 --> 02:20:42.300
EFFECTIVE TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS

02:20:42.367 --> 02:20:43.835
FOR MANY MANY YEARS.

02:20:43.902 --> 02:20:44.736
IN TERMS OF CLIMATE CHANGE

02:20:44.803 --> 02:20:46.604
IMPACTS RESIDENTS OF CAN'T TO A

02:20:46.671 --> 02:20:48.406
CREEK AND EL PORVENIR STRUGGLE

02:20:48.473 --> 02:20:49.607
WHICH RANKING WATER THAT HAS

02:20:49.674 --> 02:20:51.142
HISTORICALLY BEEN CONTAMINATED

02:20:51.209 --> 02:20:52.811
BUT WITH NITRATE.

02:20:52.877 --> 02:20:54.979
AND MORE RECENTLY WITH SOMETHING

02:20:55.046 --> 02:20:56.581
CALLED DISINFECTANT BY PRODUCTS

02:20:56.648 --> 02:20:57.916
WHICH IS A RESULT OF RECEIVING

02:20:57.982 --> 02:20:59.684
WATER FROM WESTLANDS WATER

02:20:59.751 --> 02:21:01.486
DISTRICT THAT TO BE TREATED --

02:21:01.553 --> 02:21:02.821
AND PROVIDED AND PRODUCED

02:21:02.887 --> 02:21:04.656
DISINFECTANT BRIGHT BY PRODUCTS

02:21:04.722 --> 02:21:07.525
SUCH THAT THE WATER CAN'T BE --

02:21:07.592 --> 02:21:08.026
CONSUMED OR SHOULDN'T BE

02:21:08.092 --> 02:21:08.927
CONSUMED.

02:21:08.993 --> 02:21:11.629
AND BASED ON THIS ARRANGEMENT

02:21:11.696 --> 02:21:13.064
WITH WESTLANDS FOLKS ARE ALSO --

02:21:13.131 --> 02:21:14.566
EXPERIENCING VERY VERY HIGH

02:21:14.632 --> 02:21:16.467
WATER BILLS -- SOMETIMES OVER A

02:21:16.534 --> 02:21:17.335
HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH FOR

02:21:17.402 --> 02:21:21.072
WATER THAT RESIDENTS CAN'T DRINK.

02:21:21.139 --> 02:21:21.773
LIKE TO LEGAL RESIDENTS

02:21:21.840 --> 02:21:23.208
EXPERIENCE HIGH HE DAIS AND MANY

02:21:23.274 --> 02:21:25.143
RESIDENTS LACK AIR CONDITIONING

02:21:25.210 --> 02:21:26.411
AND COULDN'T AFFORD TO RUN A

02:21:26.477 --> 02:21:27.712
CONDITIONING IF THAT HAD IT.

02:21:27.779 --> 02:21:29.514
THESE ISSUES ARE EXACERBATED BY

02:21:29.581 --> 02:21:31.616
ISSUES WITH THEIR WATER SYSTEM --

02:21:31.683 --> 02:21:33.084
LIKE INTO A BILL.

02:21:33.151 --> 02:21:34.285
GIVEN THE LONG ONE HOUR DRIVE TO

02:21:34.352 --> 02:21:36.421
FRESNO FOR ESSENTIAL SERVICES

02:21:36.487 --> 02:21:38.189
LIKE MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS ACCESS

02:21:38.256 --> 02:21:39.290
TO GROCERY STORES AND LEGAL

02:21:39.357 --> 02:21:40.391
SERVICES.

02:21:40.458 --> 02:21:42.060
ALONG WITH THE FACT THAT MANY

02:21:42.126 --> 02:21:43.695
RESIDENTS LACKED VEHICLES AND

02:21:43.761 --> 02:21:45.763
CAN AFFORD CANNOT AFFORD GAS FOR

02:21:45.830 --> 02:21:47.198
FREQUENT TRIPS TO FRESNO.

02:21:47.265 --> 02:21:48.199
RESIDENTS IDENTIFIED

02:21:48.266 --> 02:21:49.968
IMPROVEMENTS TO TRANSPORTATION

02:21:50.034 --> 02:21:52.437
AS HIGH PRIORITY. FOR THE BOTH

02:21:52.503 --> 02:21:54.472
COMMUNITIES TO RESPOND TO THE

02:21:54.539 --> 02:21:55.540
LACK OF TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS

02:21:55.607 --> 02:21:57.108
COMMUNITY RESIDENTS PARTNERED

02:21:57.175 --> 02:21:57.876
WITH.

02:21:57.942 --> 02:22:00.345
MY ORGANIZATION AND A RIDE CHER

02:22:00.411 --> 02:22:01.779
COMPANY CALLED GREEN COMMUTER

02:22:01.846 --> 02:22:03.348
AND ORGAN OTHER ORGANIZATIONS TO

02:22:03.414 --> 02:22:05.650
START THE COUNTRY'S FIRST ALL

02:22:05.717 --> 02:22:06.718
ELECTRIC RURAL RIDE CHER.

02:22:06.784 --> 02:22:08.119
THEY NOW HAVE TO ELECTRIC

02:22:08.186 --> 02:22:10.121
VEHICLES THAT ARE DRIVEN BY

02:22:10.188 --> 02:22:12.724
RESIDENTS -- TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:22:12.790 --> 02:22:14.726
THE RESIDENTS ABOUT COMMUNITIES

02:22:14.792 --> 02:22:16.461
HAVE A TRANSPORTATION.

02:22:16.527 --> 02:22:18.096
OPTION THAT WORKS FOR THEM THEY

02:22:18.162 --> 02:22:19.898
HAVE A WAY TO GET TO FRESNO TO

02:22:19.964 --> 02:22:21.065
AXIS.

02:22:21.132 --> 02:22:23.301
AND ESSENTIAL SERVICES AND ALSO

02:22:23.368 --> 02:22:24.569
IT'S A IT'S A PROGRAM THAT'S

02:22:24.636 --> 02:22:27.572
OPERATED BY RESIDENTS WITH --

02:22:27.639 --> 02:22:29.340
ZERO EMISSIONS SO WE SEE THAT AS

02:22:29.407 --> 02:22:30.909
A MODEL AND SOMETHING WE'RE

02:22:30.975 --> 02:22:32.677
TRYING TO EXPAND -- WE'RE

02:22:32.744 --> 02:22:33.711
WORKING WITH GREEN COMMUTER

02:22:33.778 --> 02:22:35.213
AGAIN AND DEL HIGH AND ALSO

02:22:35.280 --> 02:22:36.547
LOOKING AT KERN COUNTY AS

02:22:36.614 --> 02:22:37.982
ANOTHER OPTION TO EXPAND THAT

02:22:38.049 --> 02:22:38.750
PROGRAM.

02:22:38.816 --> 02:22:40.685
BUT I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING

02:22:40.752 --> 02:22:41.319
THAT THE STATE SHOULD LOOK HARD

02:22:41.386 --> 02:22:42.954
AT TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS THAT

02:22:43.021 --> 02:22:44.656
WORK FOR COMMUNITIES AND ARE

02:22:44.722 --> 02:22:49.294
TAILORED TO RURAL COMMUNITIES.

02:22:49.360 --> 02:22:50.161
FINALLY I'M GONNA TURN A LITTLE

02:22:50.228 --> 02:22:52.330
BIT TO AGRICULTURAL EMISSIONS --

02:22:52.397 --> 02:22:54.565
ONE NEARLY UNIVERSAL FACT ABOUT

02:22:54.632 --> 02:22:56.267
LIVING IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY.

02:22:56.334 --> 02:22:57.468
AND THE EAST COAST COACHELLA

02:22:57.535 --> 02:22:59.170
VALLEY IS PROXIMITY TO

02:22:59.237 --> 02:23:00.805
AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS THESE

02:23:00.872 --> 02:23:02.440
INCLUDE LARGE DAIRIES ALMOND

02:23:02.507 --> 02:23:04.075
ORCHARDS GRAPEVINES FOOD

02:23:04.142 --> 02:23:06.611
PROCESSING PLANTS.

02:23:06.678 --> 02:23:08.046
AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES --

02:23:08.112 --> 02:23:09.948
WITH RESPECT TO DERRY'S THERE'S

02:23:10.014 --> 02:23:11.215
WELL BUT THERE IS AN IRRIGATED

02:23:11.282 --> 02:23:12.417
AGRICULTURE I'M GONNA TALK A

02:23:12.483 --> 02:23:14.719
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TIE BETWEEN

02:23:14.786 --> 02:23:16.454
WATER QUALITY AND AIR QUALITY.

02:23:16.521 --> 02:23:17.522
I WORK A LOT MORE ON THE WATER

02:23:17.588 --> 02:23:19.357
QUALITY SIDE -- BUT THERE'S

02:23:19.424 --> 02:23:23.161
DEFINITELY -- INTERSECTION THERE --

02:23:23.227 --> 02:23:24.362
FOR DERRY'S MANURE MANAGEMENT

02:23:24.429 --> 02:23:26.531
MANAGEMENT AT TERRY'S AND

02:23:26.597 --> 02:23:28.199
INTERROGATE EMISSIONS FROM --

02:23:28.266 --> 02:23:31.035
CALLOUS CONTRIBUTE FIVE POINT 4%

02:23:31.102 --> 02:23:32.637
OF CALIFORNIA'S TWENTY FOURTEEN

02:23:32.704 --> 02:23:33.638
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

02:23:33.705 --> 02:23:35.373
INVENTORY AND FAR MORE WHEN

02:23:35.440 --> 02:23:36.341
CALCULATED.

02:23:36.407 --> 02:23:39.610
ON A TWENTY YEAR GLOBAL WARMING

02:23:39.677 --> 02:23:40.311
POTENTIAL.

02:23:40.378 --> 02:23:40.945
METHANE EMISSIONS FROM ENTERIC

02:23:41.012 --> 02:23:43.448
FERMENTATION ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT

02:23:43.514 --> 02:23:45.450
29% OF CALIFORNIA'S TOTAL

02:23:45.516 --> 02:23:47.585
METHANE INVENTORY WELL MINORE

02:23:47.652 --> 02:23:49.087
MANAGEMENT CONTRIBUTES ANOTHER

02:23:49.153 --> 02:23:51.356
APPROXIMATELY 26%.

02:23:51.422 --> 02:23:53.725
THIS IS A A BIG CHUNK OF THE

02:23:53.791 --> 02:23:55.326
METHANE WITHIN THE STATE.

02:23:55.393 --> 02:23:56.294
IN HOPE OF REDUCING EMISSIONS

02:23:56.361 --> 02:23:58.029
THE STATE HAS INVESTED HUNDREDS

02:23:58.096 --> 02:23:59.397
OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN

02:23:59.464 --> 02:24:01.399
TAXPAYER AND RATE PAYER

02:24:01.466 --> 02:24:02.200
SUBSIDIES.

02:24:02.266 --> 02:24:04.502
TOWARDS CONSTRUCTION OF DERRY

02:24:04.569 --> 02:24:06.471
DIGESTERS A LOT OF WHICH ARE

02:24:06.537 --> 02:24:07.805
LOCATED IN THE SAN JOAQUIN

02:24:07.872 --> 02:24:09.173
VALLEY.

02:24:09.240 --> 02:24:10.375
WE THINK THERE'S NO EVIDENCE SO

02:24:10.441 --> 02:24:12.210
FAR THAT THE STATE JESTERS ARE A

02:24:12.276 --> 02:24:13.511
GOOD INVESTMENT GIVEN THAT WE

02:24:13.578 --> 02:24:14.278
HAVE.

02:24:14.345 --> 02:24:16.114
NO AIR QUALITY MONITORING TO

02:24:16.180 --> 02:24:17.648
ESTABLISH EMISSION REDUCTIONS IF

02:24:17.715 --> 02:24:19.550
ANY ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR DIGEST

02:24:19.617 --> 02:24:21.486
ERRORS AND ADDITIONALLY THOUGH

02:24:21.552 --> 02:24:22.420
DERRY DIGEST OUR PROGRAM

02:24:22.487 --> 02:24:24.889
INCENTIVIZE IS AN INSURERS

02:24:24.956 --> 02:24:26.691
CONTINUE DAIRY HERDS OF A SIZE

02:24:26.758 --> 02:24:28.326
THAT ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH GHG

02:24:28.393 --> 02:24:31.496
REDUCTIONS.

02:24:31.562 --> 02:24:31.996
AS WELL AS WATER QUALITY

02:24:32.063 --> 02:24:33.598
PROTECTION.

02:24:33.664 --> 02:24:34.165
THE STATE SHOULD BEGIN THE

02:24:34.232 --> 02:24:34.866
REGULATOR IS TO ENSURE THAT THEY

02:24:34.932 --> 02:24:36.634
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE METHANE

02:24:36.701 --> 02:24:38.202
EMISSIONS AND SHOULD TAKE A MUCH

02:24:38.269 --> 02:24:39.670
HARD TO LOOK AT MORE BENEFICIAL

02:24:39.737 --> 02:24:41.672
PROGRAMS SELECT DRIVING OR

02:24:41.739 --> 02:24:43.041
MANAGEMENT.

02:24:43.107 --> 02:24:44.942
TURNING TO IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE

02:24:45.009 --> 02:24:47.612
AND AND NITROUS OXIDE.

02:24:47.678 --> 02:24:49.047
NITROUS OXIDE AS A PRIMARY

02:24:49.113 --> 02:24:50.748
COMPONENT -- WITH AIR POLLUTION

02:24:50.815 --> 02:24:52.917
AS WE KNOW A RECENT STUDY

02:24:52.984 --> 02:24:56.387
CONCLUDES THAT 252401% OF THE

02:24:56.454 --> 02:24:57.955
STATE'S NITROUS OXIDE.

02:24:58.022 --> 02:24:59.757
IS RELATED TO IRRIGATED

02:24:59.824 --> 02:25:01.626
AGRICULTURE.

02:25:01.692 --> 02:25:03.327
DECIDE NOT TO MISSIONS ARE

02:25:03.394 --> 02:25:04.962
DIRECTLY TIES TO OVER

02:25:05.029 --> 02:25:06.497
APPLICATION OF NITROGEN

02:25:06.564 --> 02:25:07.865
FERTILIZER BY IRRIGATED

02:25:07.932 --> 02:25:09.267
AGRICULTURE.

02:25:09.333 --> 02:25:11.269
AND AGAIN THIS IS A CONNECTION

02:25:11.335 --> 02:25:13.337
BETWEEN BOTH AIR QUALITY AND

02:25:13.404 --> 02:25:15.006
WATER QUALITY SO OVER

02:25:15.073 --> 02:25:17.308
APPLICATION OF FERTILIZER WHILE

02:25:17.375 --> 02:25:19.610
BOTH -- DEGRADING OUR AIR

02:25:19.677 --> 02:25:20.545
QUALITY IS HAVING A REALLY

02:25:20.611 --> 02:25:22.647
NEGATIVE EFFECT ON WATER QUALITY

02:25:22.713 --> 02:25:24.148
IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND

02:25:24.215 --> 02:25:25.450
THE CENTRAL COAST'S SOME

02:25:25.516 --> 02:25:27.752
SOMETIMES UPWARDS OF 40% OF

02:25:27.819 --> 02:25:30.088
DOMESTIC WELLS.

02:25:30.154 --> 02:25:30.621
ARE NOW CONTAMINATED WITH

02:25:30.688 --> 02:25:32.723
NITRATE -- AND THIS IS AGAIN

02:25:32.790 --> 02:25:34.292
DIRECTLY TIED OVER APPLICATION

02:25:34.358 --> 02:25:36.527
OF FERTILIZER.

02:25:36.594 --> 02:25:38.229
OUR RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THE

02:25:38.296 --> 02:25:40.598
STATE BEGIN TO LOOK AT STRICT

02:25:40.665 --> 02:25:42.033
LIMITS ON FERTILIZER

02:25:42.100 --> 02:25:45.369
APPLICATIONS -- AND THAT THE

02:25:45.436 --> 02:25:47.238
STATE MUST ALSO PUT IN PLACE

02:25:47.305 --> 02:25:49.040
STRONG RESTRICTIONS ON PESTICIDE

02:25:49.107 --> 02:25:50.641
APPLICATIONS FOR PROTECTION.

02:25:50.708 --> 02:25:52.076
OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND RURAL

02:25:52.143 --> 02:25:54.245
COMMUNITIES.

02:25:54.312 --> 02:25:55.146
AND THEN FINALLY TO CONCLUDE

02:25:55.213 --> 02:25:56.147
I'LL JUST SHARE A COUPLE OF

02:25:56.214 --> 02:25:58.015
FINAL THOUGHTS REGARDING CLIMATE

02:25:58.082 --> 02:25:59.784
CHANGE PLANNING AND INVESTMENTS

02:25:59.851 --> 02:26:00.918
AND WRITE A REGULATIONS

02:26:00.985 --> 02:26:02.053
IMPACTING.

02:26:02.120 --> 02:26:03.921
RURAL COMMUNITIES IN THE SAN

02:26:03.988 --> 02:26:04.489
JOAQUIN AND THESE COACHELLA

02:26:04.555 --> 02:26:06.757
VALLEY -- FOR ADAPTATION AND

02:26:06.824 --> 02:26:08.926
RESILIENCE EFFORTS AND WROTE

02:26:08.993 --> 02:26:10.528
COME IN A COMMUNITIES TO BE

02:26:10.595 --> 02:26:12.864
EFFECTIVE WE NEED A FEW THINGS.

02:26:12.930 --> 02:26:14.298
FIRST WE NEED A LOCAL PLANNING

02:26:14.365 --> 02:26:15.666
THAT INCLUDES MEANINGFUL

02:26:15.733 --> 02:26:17.168
OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT OF

02:26:17.235 --> 02:26:18.703
EFFECTIVE COMMUNITY RESIDENT

02:26:18.769 --> 02:26:20.037
RESIDENTS.

02:26:20.104 --> 02:26:21.973
ON A COMMUNITY LEVEL AND THAT

02:26:22.039 --> 02:26:23.141
WOULD INCLUDE SOLUTIONS

02:26:23.207 --> 02:26:25.476
IDENTIFIED BY AND TAILORED TO

02:26:25.543 --> 02:26:27.945
EACH COMMUNITY -- AND FINALLY WE

02:26:28.012 --> 02:26:29.280
NEED TARGETED INVESTMENTS

02:26:29.347 --> 02:26:31.282
FOCUSED ON RURAL COMMUNITIES AND

02:26:31.349 --> 02:26:33.084
PARTICULAR DISADVANTAGED

02:26:33.151 --> 02:26:35.219
UNINCORPORATED COMMUNITIES AS AN

02:26:35.286 --> 02:26:36.821
EXAMPLE OF THIS NEED.

02:26:36.888 --> 02:26:38.156
AS A CONTINUED SHAME THAT

02:26:38.222 --> 02:26:39.724
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ARE

02:26:39.790 --> 02:26:42.894
NOT YET ELIGIBLE FOR TCC --

02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:44.262
CLIMATE OR TRANSFORMATIVE

02:26:44.328 --> 02:26:45.997
COMMUNITY THIS PROGRAM

02:26:46.063 --> 02:26:48.733
IMPLEMENTATION GRANTS SB THREE

02:26:48.799 --> 02:26:50.601
FIFTY ONE WOULD SEEK TO RIGHT

02:26:50.668 --> 02:26:52.537
THIS WRONG AND WE URGE THE

02:26:52.603 --> 02:26:55.740
LEGISLATURE TO PASS IT THIS YEAR --

02:26:55.806 --> 02:26:56.774
BY MAKING.

02:26:56.841 --> 02:26:58.009
DISADVANTAGED UNINCORPORATED

02:26:58.075 --> 02:26:59.377
COMMUNITIES ELIGIBLE FOR TCC

02:26:59.443 --> 02:27:00.845
IMPLEMENTATION GRANTS RATHER

02:27:00.912 --> 02:27:02.280
THAN JUST THE PLANNING GRANTS

02:27:02.346 --> 02:27:05.349
ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FOR TODAY.

02:27:05.416 --> 02:27:06.884
AND THEN FINALLY TO EFFECTIVELY

02:27:06.951 --> 02:27:09.554
REDUCE METHANE NITROUS OXIDE AND

02:27:09.620 --> 02:27:10.621
IMPROVE AIR QUALITY IN

02:27:10.688 --> 02:27:13.090
COMMUNITIES IN CLOSE PROXIMITY.

02:27:13.157 --> 02:27:14.625
TO AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS WE

02:27:14.692 --> 02:27:16.561
NEED TO SEE EFFECTIVE SMART AND

02:27:16.627 --> 02:27:18.563
STRONG REGULATIONS THAT REDUCE

02:27:18.629 --> 02:27:20.598
FERTILIZER OVER APPLICATION AND

02:27:20.665 --> 02:27:21.933
BEGIN TO REDUCE.

02:27:21.999 --> 02:27:23.401
DAIRY HERD SIZES STELLAR TO

02:27:23.467 --> 02:27:24.902
LEVELS WHERE PROTECTING AIR

02:27:24.969 --> 02:27:27.471
QUALITY AND WATER QUALITY IS

02:27:27.538 --> 02:27:29.507
FEASIBLE AND PRACTICABLE.

02:27:29.574 --> 02:27:32.376
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I'D

02:27:32.443 --> 02:27:33.044
BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

02:27:33.110 --> 02:27:38.115
THANK YOU ARE A I APPRECIATE THE

02:27:38.182 --> 02:27:39.650
LAPPING MESSAGE THAT WE NEED TO

02:27:39.717 --> 02:27:40.785
ENGAGE.

02:27:40.851 --> 02:27:42.119
LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND A MORE

02:27:42.186 --> 02:27:43.854
MEANINGFUL WAY AND ALLOW THEM TO

02:27:43.921 --> 02:27:46.224
STEER OF BOTH THE IDENTIFICATION

02:27:46.290 --> 02:27:48.392
OF PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS.

02:27:48.459 --> 02:27:49.026
HOW THAT WORK FOR THEM AND THE

02:27:49.093 --> 02:27:52.096
WORK WE STILL HAVE TO DO -- AS

02:27:52.163 --> 02:27:54.332
THE STATE'S FIGURE THAT OUT --

02:27:54.398 --> 02:27:57.802
IN ADDITION YOU YOU SPOKE ABOUT --

02:27:57.868 --> 02:27:59.670
METHANE EMISSIONS AND SOME OF

02:27:59.737 --> 02:28:02.440
THE LIMITATIONS WITH WITH

02:28:02.506 --> 02:28:08.446
DAIRIES -- WITH THIRTY DAY

02:28:08.512 --> 02:28:10.348
JUSTICE OUT THERE.

02:28:10.414 --> 02:28:11.315
THEY NEED MENTION DRY MANY ARE

02:28:11.382 --> 02:28:14.452
MANAGEMENT AND ARE THERE OTHER.

02:28:14.518 --> 02:28:16.220
OF SOLUTIONS THAT YOU RECOMMEND

02:28:16.287 --> 02:28:18.055
OTHER THAN THE DRIVE MANY ARE

02:28:18.122 --> 02:28:18.623
MANAGEMENT THAT WE SHOULD BE

02:28:18.689 --> 02:28:20.691
LOOKING AT YEAH SO THAT'S A GOOD

02:28:20.758 --> 02:28:22.893
QUESTION -- AND I THINK IT'S

02:28:22.960 --> 02:28:25.129
IMPORTANT JUST AS BACKGROUND. TO

02:28:25.196 --> 02:28:26.063
REALIZE THAT THESE THEIR

02:28:26.130 --> 02:28:29.834
DIGESTERS -- CAN ONLY CAPTURE

02:28:29.900 --> 02:28:31.836
METHANE OVER DERRY LAGOON.

02:28:31.902 --> 02:28:33.371
SO THAT IT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT

02:28:33.437 --> 02:28:35.539
PIECE OF THE METHANE PUZZLE FOR

02:28:35.606 --> 02:28:37.541
TERRY'S BUT IT'S NOT ALL OF IT --

02:28:37.608 --> 02:28:39.810
SO THERE'S OTHER -- MINORE

02:28:39.877 --> 02:28:41.279
MANAGEMENT THAT OCCURS AT

02:28:41.345 --> 02:28:43.014
TERRY'S AND THESE STARED

02:28:43.080 --> 02:28:44.582
ADJUSTERS DON'T HAVE ANY IMPACT

02:28:44.649 --> 02:28:46.183
ON THAT MANY ARE MANAGEMENT

02:28:46.250 --> 02:28:47.718
OUTSIDE THE LAGOONS.

02:28:47.785 --> 02:28:49.353
AND IT ALSO HAS NO IMPACT ON

02:28:49.420 --> 02:28:51.822
INTERROGATIONS -- FROM THE COUCH

02:28:51.889 --> 02:28:54.125
THEMSELVES -- SO IN ADDITION TO

02:28:54.191 --> 02:28:55.693
DRIVING OR MANAGEMENT WHICH THE

02:28:55.760 --> 02:28:57.561
STATUS STARTED INVEST AND

02:28:57.628 --> 02:28:59.096
PROBABLY NEEDS TO DO MORE.

02:28:59.163 --> 02:29:01.132
BUT ALSO JUST REQUIREMENTS FOR

02:29:01.198 --> 02:29:02.500
IMPROVED PRACTICES AROUND

02:29:02.566 --> 02:29:03.901
DRIVING OR MANAGEMENT.

02:29:03.968 --> 02:29:04.802
IN ADDITION OF THAT THOUGH WE

02:29:04.869 --> 02:29:07.038
NEED TO TAKE A STRONG LOOK AT

02:29:07.104 --> 02:29:08.673
DAIRY HERD SIZES WITHIN THE SAN

02:29:08.739 --> 02:29:11.342
JOAQUIN VALLEY -- THOSE HERD

02:29:11.409 --> 02:29:14.245
SIZES BASED ON A REPORT FROM THE

02:29:14.312 --> 02:29:15.713
DAIRY INDUSTRY ITSELF IN THE

02:29:15.780 --> 02:29:16.714
CENTRAL VALLEY.

02:29:16.781 --> 02:29:18.983
ARE BASICALLY INCOMPATIBLE RIGHT

02:29:19.050 --> 02:29:20.351
NOW WITH WATER QUALITY

02:29:20.418 --> 02:29:22.019
PROTECTION THAT THE DAIRY

02:29:22.086 --> 02:29:24.555
INDUSTRY DID -- MONITORING

02:29:24.622 --> 02:29:26.257
REPORT THAT CAME OUT EARLIER

02:29:26.324 --> 02:29:28.159
THIS YEAR THE CONCLUSION OF THAT

02:29:28.225 --> 02:29:29.660
REPORT IS THAT ALL DERRY'S

02:29:29.727 --> 02:29:31.395
WITHIN THIS MONITORING PROGRAM

02:29:31.462 --> 02:29:33.731
WHICH IS DISTRICT BE REPRESENTED.

02:29:33.798 --> 02:29:35.299
OF THE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE AND

02:29:35.366 --> 02:29:40.438
THE CENTRAL VALLEY ALL OF THOSE

02:29:40.504 --> 02:29:41.272
AREAS WERE POLLUTING GROUNDWATER.

02:29:41.339 --> 02:29:41.806
AND THE SOLUTIONS TO THAT

02:29:41.872 --> 02:29:43.474
PROBLEM RECOMMENDED BY THE DAIRY

02:29:43.541 --> 02:29:44.709
INDUSTRY'S REPORT WERE ONE

02:29:44.775 --> 02:29:46.377
FIGURE OUT WAYS TO EXPORT THIS

02:29:46.444 --> 02:29:48.346
MAN OR IN A WAY THAT THEY CAN BE

02:29:48.412 --> 02:29:49.280
SOLD.

02:29:49.347 --> 02:29:51.015
FOR IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE AND

02:29:51.082 --> 02:29:52.450
THEN AS A SECOND RECOMMENDATION

02:29:52.516 --> 02:29:53.884
FROM THEIR INDUSTRIES REPORT

02:29:53.951 --> 02:29:56.253
LOOK AT HEARD SIZES BECAUSE

02:29:56.320 --> 02:29:58.289
WE'RE AND SO A SITUATION WHERE

02:29:58.356 --> 02:30:00.157
IF YOU HAVE. FOR EXAMPLE SOME

02:30:00.224 --> 02:30:01.692
BERRIES HAVE TEN THOUSAND HOUSE

02:30:01.759 --> 02:30:03.327
OR MORE YOU HAVE THAT MANY COWS

02:30:03.394 --> 02:30:04.695
THERE'S JUST NOT ANYTHING YOU

02:30:04.762 --> 02:30:06.197
CAN DO WITH THE DAIRYMAN NORTH

02:30:06.263 --> 02:30:07.965
THAT'S NOT GOING TO POLLUTE.

02:30:08.032 --> 02:30:08.666
BOTH AIR QUALITY AND WATER

02:30:08.733 --> 02:30:12.703
QUALITY SO A STRONG LOOK AT

02:30:12.770 --> 02:30:14.105
THEIR HURTS US IS.

02:30:14.171 --> 02:30:16.374
SO CAN -- WE TALK ABOUT THE

02:30:16.440 --> 02:30:20.711
LAGOONS VERSUS THE HURT SIZE.

02:30:20.778 --> 02:30:23.247
DRAMMEN OR WHAT HOW MUCH.

02:30:23.314 --> 02:30:24.915
AND WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH DATA

02:30:24.982 --> 02:30:27.718
YET ON THESE THIRTY DAY JUSTICE.

02:30:27.785 --> 02:30:29.153
AWESOME LET'S SAY THAT MAYBE

02:30:29.220 --> 02:30:30.454
THEY DO WORK FOR NOT.

02:30:30.521 --> 02:30:31.889
LATE ENOUGH DATA TO SEE THAT'S

02:30:31.956 --> 02:30:34.392
TRUE OR NOT -- BUT WHAT KIND OF

02:30:34.458 --> 02:30:35.292
WHAT.

02:30:35.359 --> 02:30:36.360
WHAT'S THE PERCENTAGE OF A

02:30:36.427 --> 02:30:37.495
PORTION THAT'S NOT IN THE

02:30:37.561 --> 02:30:38.396
LAGOONS HOW MUCH ABOUT THE NEVER

02:30:38.462 --> 02:30:40.464
LEAVING BEHIND OF ONLY FOCUSING

02:30:40.531 --> 02:30:41.632
ON TERRY THAT JESTERS.

02:30:41.699 --> 02:30:45.469
I DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFIC NUMBER --

02:30:45.536 --> 02:30:46.670
FOUR MANEUVER MANAGEMENT THOUGH

02:30:46.737 --> 02:30:48.172
THE PORTION THAT'S LAGOONS THAN

02:30:48.239 --> 02:30:49.740
THE PORTION THAT'S OUTSIDE OF

02:30:49.807 --> 02:30:53.177
LAGOONS -- BUT IT'S 29% OF THE

02:30:53.244 --> 02:30:56.380
TOTAL STATE WIDE -- METHANE

02:30:56.447 --> 02:30:58.783
INVENTORY IS -- LAGOONS AND

02:30:58.849 --> 02:31:01.018
OTHER MEN OR MANAGEMENT AND 26%

02:31:01.085 --> 02:31:06.056
IS ENTERIC EMISSIONS OF I GOT

02:31:06.123 --> 02:31:09.794
THAT RIGHT I CONFLICT.

02:31:09.860 --> 02:31:12.062
I'M OKAY FOR OUR READY IN A TIME

02:31:12.129 --> 02:31:13.964

MORE QUESTIONS FOR IN THE FUTURE

02:31:18.502 --> 02:31:19.937
BUT SOME OF THIS METHANE STUFF

02:31:20.004 --> 02:31:21.138
IN THERE THAT JUST OR SO.

MICHAEL BOCA DOOR ON BEHALF OF

02:31:47.298 --> 02:31:48.866
THE AG ENERGY CONSUMERS

02:31:48.933 --> 02:31:51.235
ASSOCIATION WORK VERY CLOSELY

02:31:51.302 --> 02:31:52.403
WITH THE DAIRY INDUSTRY AND

02:31:52.470 --> 02:31:53.504
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A DISCUSSION

02:31:53.571 --> 02:31:55.105
ABOUT DIED JESTERS WE'D LIKE TO

02:31:55.172 --> 02:31:56.707
BE PART OF THAT DISCUSSION A LOT

02:31:56.774 --> 02:31:57.274
OF THE INFORMATION YOU HEARD

02:31:57.341 --> 02:31:57.975
TODAY.

02:31:58.042 --> 02:32:00.311
MAY NOT BE ACCURATE WE HAVE VERY

02:32:00.377 --> 02:32:01.912
GOOD NUMBERS ON HOW MUCH.

02:32:01.979 --> 02:32:04.048
JERRY ARE REDUCING THEIR METHANE

02:32:04.114 --> 02:32:06.417
EMISSIONS IT'S ROUGHLY FIFTY

02:32:06.484 --> 02:32:07.384
FIFTY BETWEEN THE NEWER AND

02:32:07.451 --> 02:32:08.619
ENTERIC THE PART THAT COMES

02:32:08.686 --> 02:32:09.820
DIRECTLY FROM THE CAL.

02:32:09.887 --> 02:32:12.389
THERE'S NO WAY OF REDUCING

02:32:12.456 --> 02:32:12.990
METHANE DIRECTLY FROM THE COW

02:32:13.057 --> 02:32:13.791
TODAY.

02:32:13.858 --> 02:32:15.092
OF THE CERTAIN THINGS BEING

02:32:15.159 --> 02:32:17.962
RESEARCHED AND REVIEWED BY FTA

02:32:18.028 --> 02:32:18.863
AND OTHERS BUT THERE'S NO WAY TO

02:32:18.929 --> 02:32:20.831
DO THAT WE'RE DOING A FANTASTIC

02:32:20.898 --> 02:32:22.166
JOB WERE RUDE AND THE DERRY

02:32:22.233 --> 02:32:24.168
DIGEST A PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA.

02:32:24.235 --> 02:32:25.669
IS BY FAR THE MOST COST

02:32:25.736 --> 02:32:27.505
EFFECTIVE PROGRAM THAT STATE IS

02:32:27.571 --> 02:32:28.873
CURRENTLY INVESTING IN.

02:32:28.939 --> 02:32:31.408
ITS REDUCING MORE TOTAL GHG THAN

02:32:31.475 --> 02:32:32.977
ANY OTHER PROGRAM INCLUDING

02:32:33.043 --> 02:32:34.311
PROGRAMS THAT HAVE FAR MORE

02:32:34.378 --> 02:32:35.212
FUNDING.

02:32:35.279 --> 02:32:36.647
AND SO SUGGESTIONS THAT WE

02:32:36.714 --> 02:32:38.282
SHOULD QUIT FUNDING GEHRY DIED

02:32:38.349 --> 02:32:40.651
JESTERS IS DIRECTLY CON SKIS ME

02:32:40.718 --> 02:32:43.120
CONTRARY TO OUR GHG GOALS AND

02:32:43.187 --> 02:32:44.388
METHANE REDUCTION GOALS IN

02:32:44.455 --> 02:32:50.661
CALIFORNIA.

02:32:50.728 --> 02:32:52.329
MORE IMPORTANTLY.

02:32:52.396 --> 02:32:52.997
REDUCING HERD SIZES IN

02:32:53.063 --> 02:32:54.431
CALIFORNIA IS NOT GONNA REDUCE

02:32:54.498 --> 02:32:54.698
METHANE.

02:32:54.765 --> 02:32:55.533
SIMPLY GOING TO SHIFT NOTHING

02:32:55.599 --> 02:32:56.133
PRODUCTION AND INCREASE IT BY

02:32:56.200 --> 02:32:58.102
PUTTING IT IN OTHER STATES THAT

02:32:58.168 --> 02:32:59.470
ARE NOT REDUCING METHANE TOTAL

02:32:59.537 --> 02:33:00.905
DEMAND FOR GERRY IS NOT GOING TO

02:33:00.971 --> 02:33:02.339
CHANGE BECAUSE CALIFORNIA

02:33:02.406 --> 02:33:03.974
REDUCES HERD SIZES.

02:33:04.041 --> 02:33:05.609
ARE HERDS ARE COMING DOWN HERE

02:33:05.676 --> 02:33:06.977
BECAUSE WE'RE LOSING DAIRIES

02:33:07.044 --> 02:33:08.145
WITH THESE FIFTY TO SIXTY

02:33:08.212 --> 02:33:09.446
DERRY'S EVERY YEAR.

02:33:09.513 --> 02:33:10.915
IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE FIRST TIME

02:33:10.981 --> 02:33:13.183
OR HEARD TOTAL HURT CALIFORNIA'S

02:33:13.250 --> 02:33:14.285
REDUCING.

02:33:14.351 --> 02:33:15.586
SO WE WOULD BE VERY MUCH

02:33:15.653 --> 02:33:16.921
APPRECIATIVE OF BEING PART OF

02:33:16.987 --> 02:33:18.756
ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION SO THAT

02:33:18.822 --> 02:33:19.757
WE'RE GETTING ACCURATE

02:33:19.823 --> 02:33:21.358
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE DAIRY

02:33:21.425 --> 02:33:22.660
INDUSTRY'S DOING TO REDUCE

02:33:22.726 --> 02:33:24.128
METHANE IT'S ACTUALLY A

02:33:24.194 --> 02:33:25.729
TREMENDOUSLY POSITIVE STORY.

02:33:25.796 --> 02:33:29.667
WE WOULD WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY

02:33:29.733 --> 02:33:30.668
