THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU SOMEONE MEMBER CHOI FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- I HAD SERVED IN KOREA FOR A YEAR ON THE DEMILITARIZED ZONE AND NEAR THE DEMILITARIZED ZONE. AND WAS WITNESS TO THE COURAGE DEDICATION AND THE PERSEVERANCE OF KOREAN SOLDIERS AND I BELIEVE CAPTAIN NEWMAN ALSO SERVED IN KOREAN PROBABLY FEELS SIMILARLY TO THE WAY I DO CONCERNING OUR OUR KOREAN- ALLIES A COUPLE CLARIFYING QUESTIONS. IN THE IN THE RESOLUTION IT SAYS- THAT THOSE WHO WOULD SAYS VETERANS WHO SERVED IN THE VIETNAM WAR DO YOU MEAN THOSE WHO SERVED ACTUALLY IN VIETNAM OR JUST THOSE WHO SERVED. DURING THE PERIOD OF THE VIETNAM CONFLICT. ORDERED DUSTUP CAREER DOT COM FROM MONTY. NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE TO NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE BUCKS AS THE NUMBER INDICATED GO OVER A THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR. DEPOSIT TWENTY THOUSAND MORE PEOPLE SO FOR THOSE ALL WHO HAVE IMMIGRATED TO THE U. S. I. HAVE BECOME NATURALIZED US CITIZENS AND THE HORN DAY PASSED AWAY HERE THOSE ARE THE LIMITED NUMBER WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT SO IF YOU SERVED IN THE KOREAN ARMY DURING THE VIETNAM WAR BUT YOU SERVED ON CITY UP ON THE WITH OLD SO WHO SERVED. IN VIETNAM ALONG SIDE ALL FOUR U. S. OKAY SO ONLY THOSE WHO ACTUALLY SERVED IN THE COUNTRY VIETNAM YES SIR ALL RIGHT IT COULD YOU CLARIFY THAT WOULD YOU MIND. AMENDING IT TO CLARIFY THAT. BUT YOU KNOW NOTHING BUT CLARIFY THE THIS RESOLUTION. APPLIES ONLY TO THOSE WHO SERVED ACTUALLY IN VIETNAM YES IT DOES. OKAY BUT THE LANGUAGE IS NOT CLEAR SO WHAT I'M ASKING IS ARE YOU AMENABLE TO AMENDING THE BILL TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT YOU'RE ONLY REFERRING TO THOSE WHO SERVED. IN THE COUNTRY VIETNAM. FOR I DON'T HAVE THE- SPECIFIC CAR ACTUALLY EXPECT ORDER. THE RESOLUTION IS SORRY HERE RIGHT I COULD REDO THE PHRASE YOU CAN. IF YOU HAVE INFORMATION. INTENT INTENT WAS SELF APPOINTED THOSE WHO SERVED IN VIETNAM PHYSICALLY RIGHT AND I'M NOT THOSE SO DURING THAT THE ANY SOLDIERS WHO SERVED IN THE KOREAN ARMY AND THE STATION DAWKINS IN KOREA AND MYSELF ALWAYS SO. LIEUTENANT AUDIT SERVED UP BUT TALK OF OUR UNIT WAS NOT CALLED UPON TO GO TO VIETNAM SOUL I WOULD NOT BE QUALIFIED I SEE OKAY SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS IT READS. KOREAN VETERANS WHO SERVED IN THE VIETNAM WAR AND MY QUESTION TO YOU IS WOULD YOU AMEND THIS TO CLARIFY THAT YOU ARE REFERRING ONLY TO THOSE WHO SERVED IN COUNTRY YEAH IF THE OF RESOLUTION. HAS NOT ALREADY MENTIONED. YES SORRY IT WAS TO ON A NINE HUNDRED DOLLAR LOOKED UP THAT DEMAND MONTH APARTHEID I STRONGLY BELIEVE ALREADY TELL LANGUAGES SPECIFIES THAT THAT WAY. ALL RIGHT. ON THE SECOND QUESTION IS THAT- DURING MY SERVICE IN KOREA WHICH WAS QUITE AWHILE AGO THERE ARE STILL A NUMBER OF. KOREAN SOLDIERS WHO HAD SERVED DURING THE KOREAN WAR AND I KNOW MANY HAVE IMMIGRATED TO THE UNITED STATES SO WHICH WOULD YOU ALSO AMENDED THE RESOLUTION TO INCLUDE. THOSE KOREANS WHO SERVED IN THE KOREAN ARMY DURING THE KOREAN WAR AND NOW HAVE IMMIGRANT UNITED STATES AND ARE US CITIZENS WOULD YOU CONSIDER EXPANDING IT TO. THOSE KOREAN SOLDIERS WHO FOUGHT ALONGSIDE BLOOD ALONGSIDE U. S. SOLDIERS DURING THE KOREAN WAR OR- FOR. THE INTENT IS NOT TO NOT TO BECAUSE OF OR OR- WHY SO PER TO THOSE OF WAS. IN VIETNAM BUT THEY IF YOU'LL- INCLUDE THE- KOREAN WAR VETERANS SO- BUT PASS A KOREAN SOLDIER DURING THE PERIOD TALK- I'M SURE THERE WILL BE SO HAPPY BECAUSE OF. THE SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER ALL OF THEM HAVE IMMIGRATED TO AND BECAME THE- CITIZENS OF THE U. S. SO IF FOR. KNOCKED OUT THE NOT- THE JEOPARDY SAID THAT THE PASSAGE OF ICE ON TEN I MEAN DOT DO YOU WANT TO COME. AMENDMENT ANNOYED I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE DISTINCTION AND YOU'VE CLEARED THAT UP THAT THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN. SURE NOT THAT THAT WE MADE A LOSS THAT THE SINCE. THE KOREAN SOLDIERS TO SACRIFICE ABSENT ALLY ALL OF OUR U. S. ARMY U. S. A SOLDIER SO. A SEVEN BOARDS THIS THE SERVER TO GATHER OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CRITICAL OR VIETNAM WAR AND- DAYS- SHOULDER TO SHOULDER DOCILE DAS WARI. THE DESERVE UP TO HALF THE BURIAL RIGHT THE BOTTLE WHEN YOU TRY TO EXPAND IT TALK- FOR KOREAN CONFLICT OVER WHO WHERE THEY DEFENDED THEIR OWN COUNTRY EVEN SOUL US SOLDIERS ARE CAME ALONG WITH FORTY DENTAL. SO IF YOU EXPAND THAT. A CONCEPT THE U. S. SOLDIER OF ALL ALONG WITH KOREAN SOLDIERS DO IN THE KOREAN CONFLICT. TALKING ALREADY IT IS SO MORE WELCOME BUT IT DOES NUMBER ORDER ORDER. EXPAND US ON MAY BE. OUR I MEAN ALL THE WAY TO COME NOT AMENDMENT- BUT THOUGHT WE COULD TREAT IT US SEPARATELY LATER IT FOR TELL CERTAINLY DECIDE YEAH I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY SUCH A DESIRE EXPRESSED. BY KOREAN SOLDIERS. WHO FOUGHT DURING THE KOREAN WAR. THANK AM TRYING TO IS THAT IN THE MAIL YOUR ACCEPTING TO INCLUDE THOSE. YEAH OUR GLADLY ACCEPTED ALL RIGHT YEAH IN AN I SEE IN YOUR BILL ITSELF IT IT REFERENCES THE NUMBER OF IT REFERENCES THE- FACT THAT ACTUALLY VIETNAMESE SOLDIERS. L. NUMBER KOREAN SOLDIERS SO WOULD YOU CONSIDER ALSO. MAKING SURE THAT THOSE VIETNAMESE SOLDIERS WHO FOUGHT SIDE BY SIDE BY KOREAN WITH KOREAN SOLDIERS THE NUMBER OF UNITS WERE TOGETHER KOREAN AND VIETNAMESE UNITS WORK TOGETHER THAT IS WELL AS US UNITS THAT THAT THOSE VIETNAMESE SOLDIERS WHO HAVE NOW EMIGRATE UNITED STATES IN OUR U. S. CITIZENS IT MAY ALSO BE INCLUDED. OR ATM BY OLDER MEN SAW IN ALL OF THIS WAS SO BECAUSE TO US ALL ON A NON WHISTLE SENATOR DAVID MAIN. ONE ARE OF KOREAN DESCENT STUFF- AND ON THE SENATE AND- I WAS THE ONLY ONE- KOREAN AMERICANS SERVING THAT THE LEGISLATURE. SOL I KNOW PRESENTE DA AND TAIYO. KOREAN AMERICAN ARE INTO STATE THAT AND I KNOW TO. ALL A PART OF REQUESTS AND- SO REPRESENTING KOREAN COMMUNITY BUT THE I DO NOT THINK OFF OFF VIETNAMESE COMMUNITY AND DAHLE IF YOU EXPAND IT UP THERE AND ALL I'M I'M SURE VIETNAMESE OF VETERANS WHO ARE LIVING HERE AND WILL BECAME THE U. S. CITIZENS SO THAT WATER WATER COME THAT IDEA. OKAY SO ARE YOU AMENDING THE BILL TO INCLUDE VIETNAMESE AS WELL YES SIR ALL RIGHT- AND ALSO- CURRENTLY THERE ARE A NUMBER OF. AFGHANS WHO ARE IMMIGRATION UNITED STATES SOME WHO BECOME CITIZENS ALREADY WOULD YOU BE AMENABLE TO INCLUDING AFGHAN. THOSE AFGHAN SOLDIERS. A MILITARY PERSON WHO FOUGHT ALONGSIDE U. S. IN AFGHANISTAN WHO EMIGRATED TO BECOME CITIZENS WOULD YOU CONSIDER INCLUDING THEM AS WELL. I WONDER WHERE THEY ARE. HI SHOULD THE GOAL OUR PHONE. FALLECIDO VON MARI ORIGIN OR INTENT OF BONES NATASA BOUNDARY BECAUSE IF WE STOP DOING THAT TYPE THING BECAUSE IT IT IT IT IT IS- NOT THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THIS BILL- SO ANY ANYONE NOW- WHO AREN'T. ALWAYS SERVED ALL ALONG WITH THE U. S. SOLDIERS HAD SIDE BY SIDE DURING THE VIETNAM WAR ONE SO ONE BUT THE WE EXPANDED DOCTOR TO THE KOREAN WAR BUT THE IF WE START DOING THAT. ALL THE WARS THE CONFLICT OUT- IS YOUR NORMAL YOU AS A SOLDIER SAW CAR IS LAW OFFICES SO IF SO. THAT MEANS THAT IT. IT IT IS SO BEYOND THE MY IS OF ART AT THIS TIME I SEE SO KOREANS WHO FOUGHT THE KOREAN WAR IN VIETNAMESE NOT AFGHANS RIGHT. YOUR VIETNAM THEY ARE. VIETNAM SOLDIERS SAW I NEVER SPOKE WITH SUNDAY NUMBER OF FORTUNE. BUT I'LL ASSUME SINCE SO WE DO HAVE ALL SUBSTANTIAL REFUGEES FROM VIETNAM WHO SERVED AS A MILITARY SOLDIER SO HELPFUL BECAME THE U. S. CITIZENS SO THAT WOULD NOT COME TO BECAUSE SO OR YOU KNOW INTENT WAS SO- OF VIETNAMESE SO. CONFLICT OF THE SO WHO SERVED THE U. S. SOLDIER OF TASK WHY I A VIDEO. SO MIGHT BE- EMBRACEABLE HOWEVER. OUTSIDE OF THAT AREA SINCE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE KOREAN YES A SOLDIER'S SOUTH KOREAN WAR MAY BE- BOOKS OCTOBER. BUT DR ANY ANY OTHER COUNTRIES OTHER THAN A KOREAN WAR VIETNAM WAR- YES SO ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE PLO- WILL BE DILUTED SO THAT'S WHAT I'M AFRAID OF. THE THERE'S A VERY FAMOUS MEXICAN UNIT THAT FOUGHT MORE WORK TO THE NECKLACE ALSO INVITE THE AZTEC EAGLES THEY FOUGHT WITH US IT MORE WAR TWO. AND SEVERAL WERE KILLED- WHAT WOULD YOU INCLUDE THE MEMBERS OF THE MEXICAN THE AZTECS EAGLES WHO FOUGHT WITH US THE OTHER THEIR MEXICAN NATIONALS TO THE EXTENT THE NAME AND BECOME U. S. CITIZENS. WOULD YOU CONSIDER INCLUDING MEXICAN I'M NOT MEXICAN AMERICAN GIRL YET THEY ARE MIXING AMERICANS UP MEXICANS WHO FOUGHT. WITH THE AZTECS EAGLES. IN NOW ARE YOU IS. WOULD YOU CONSIDER THEM AS- I'M NOT THE REALLY. FAMILIAR OR MEXICANS. SO WHO- SERVE TO WITH A U. S. SOLDIERS ASSAULT JUSTIFICA AFGHAN CONFLICT- IT IT COST OF. ABOUT BEING BEYOND THE SCOPE ALL REGION HONORS SCHOOL BALL MY AGE A I TEN SO I. WOULD RATHER. PREFER TO THE- MAN OF THE WE HAVE I HAVE AGREED UPON ONE LOCAL KOREAN ON- WORLD CONFLICT TO SOLDIERS. WHO CAME HERE ARE- AND OF VIETNAMESE SO WHO SERVED ALONG WITH A U. S. SOLDIERS SO AND WILL BE TENDER YES OR YES OKAY SO THAT'LL JUST LARGEST EMPLOYER AND I'M MORE FOCUSED ON MIND IF I INTERJECT FIRST ONE TO REVIEW THE BIDDING- LET ME LET ME JUST FINISH OKAY SO WE'VE GOT. KOREAN WAR VETS YES WE'VE GOT THOSE TWO KOREANS WHO FOUGHT VIETNAM WE GOT VIETNAMESE NO AFGHANS NO MEXICANS RIGHT DAUGHTER THE DAUGHTER OF THE A LOT THE SIMPLER AND DOT. PLOT LINES WITH MY ORIGIN OR INTENT I'M SURE WE CAN- SOMEBODY OUT OF CELL SOME MORE. INTEREST THEY CAN- PICK UP THE DAIS MODEL ONCE WE PASS THIS ONE BECAUSE OF THIS OP AJ ON IS SO ON THE RECOMMENDATION FOR THE CONGRESS TO. ACT UPON. HI SENATE IS EMBODYING THE WILL OF THE LEGISLATURE THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE AS TO WHAT WE WOULD LIKE THE CONGRESS TO DO THIS ALL RIGHT SO IN YOUR IN YOUR ALSO AYE I SEE THAT THERE ARE. THREE THOUSAND KOREAN AMERICANS WHO FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW. UNDER THE ORIGINAL BILL WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY UNDER THE EXPANDED VERSION OF VIETNAMESE AS WELL AS KOREAN BUT THERE ARE. THREE THOUSAND WHO KOREAN. PRIMERA WHO EMIGRATE NIGHT STAYS BECOME YOU CITIZENS. SO DO YOU HAVE ANY ESTO OF THOSE FOR. WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY MORE BUT OF THOSE THREE THOUSAND WOULD WANT TO EXERCISE. THAT OPPORTUNITY BE BURIED IN A VETERANS CEMETERY I DON'T KNOW NOT TAKE. ANY RISK ABA BEING WRONG BECAUSE I HAVE NOT PAID ANY ATTENTION. AND VETERANS SO WHO WERE DIRECTLY INVOLVED. IN THE KOREAN WAR. THEY ARE PROBABLY QUITE H. THE N. NOT MOST LIKELY UP IN NINETIES AND THE HOW MANY OF THEM ARE STILL SURVIVING S. R. U. S. AS CITIZENS SO. BUT I WOULD SAY THE ARE PART ELIMINATED THAT NOT THAT MANY. OKAY SO IN TERMS OF THE CEMETERIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE YOU'RE AWARE THAT THE CEMETERY IN WEST LOS ANGELES NATIONAL CEMETERY. NO MORE NO MORE BURIALS THERE IT'S FULL RIGHT. IF YOU'RE NOT I JUST DON'T GIVE YOU THAT FACTOID. SO IN ALSO THAT. OTHER CEMETERIES ARE QUICKLY FILLING UP ARLINGTON FOR EXAMPLE- THEY ARE CONSIDERING RESTRICTING BURIALS AT ARLINGTON. SO IN TERMS OF THE THAT. THAT'S WHY I'M INTERESTED IN THE NUMBER OF. BILLS THAT WOULD TAKE PLACE UNDER THIS CRITERIA. INTO THE EXTENT THERE'S LIMITED SPACE DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF SO FOR EXAMPLE TO CREATE AMERICAN WHO'S CURRENTLY SERVING IN AFGHANISTAN RIGHT U. S. SOLDIER CURRENTLY SERVING IN AFGHANISTAN. IN TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW MAYBE. MAYBE IT MAY BE IN NEED OF A BURIAL SPOT HOW MANY OF THOSE HAVE ANY SENSE AT ALL HOW MANY CURRENTLY SERVING OR U. S. VETS BOB WOULD BE PRECLUDED HIM ANY SENSE AT ALL. NO I DON'T OKAY. IN IT AS I UNDERSTAND IT THAT- YOUR COMMUNITY REPRESENTED BY YOU KOREAN AMERICANS WELL CENTER MEN CREATE AMERICAN. A NUMBER CREATE AMERICAN SERVING ON THE IRVINE CITY COUNCIL RIGHT. BUT IN IRVINE THERE'S BEEN A EIGHT YEAR PROCESS OF SELECTING A CEMETERY IN IRVINE A VETERANS CEMETERY IS THAT RIGHT YES. AND THAT PROCESS HAS TAKEN TIME AND I THINK WE PUT. AT LEAST A COUPLE MILLION DOLLARS INTO THAT HAVE WE NOT. AND THEN NOW. IS I UNDERSTAND YOU SUPPORT A CEMETERY IN IRVINE RIGHT YES I DID ALL RIGHT GOOD BECAUSE THERE'S A MOVEMENT TO KILL THE CEMETERY IN IRVINE I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE.

OPERATORS ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT I JUST WONDER WHERE THESE FOLKS ARE GONNA BE BURIED BUT BUT I THINK I'VE HEARD YOU SAY THAT YOU DO SUPPORT A CEMETERY IN IRVINE IS THAT RIGHT. I DID TALK ABOUT HOW WHENEVER I DO SUPPORT TRANSACTION CEMETERY IN POLLING TODAY VETERANS SO THEY PREFERRED. TO GO TO ANAHEIM HILLS. AND BECAUSE THEY I HAVE A WHOLE. BECAUSE IRVINE. SAN SAW- FOREVER DO YOU GO. TO KITCHEN POSSIBLY SOLDATEN MAY PREVENT THEM TO SEE ACTUALIZATION OF A VETERANS SO THAT THEIR OWN SOCIAL SITUATION VETERANS OF THEMSELVES ARE THIRTY ARM ALL RIGHT NOW MOVING ARE TRUE AND I'M HERE ALSO AND AS I UNDERSTAND THE SUPERVISED WITHOUT BOND WEGNER IS A MEETING. JULY FIRST ON. NINE THIRTY AM AT THAT SITE. TWO OR NO OF THE SO PER DOT FOR AN I'M HERE SO THAT IS SAW- THOUGHT HE'D AWAY. THERE WILL BE I SORRY COMPONENT OF WHAT THE DEBORAH. OF A CEMETERY IN ORANGE COUNTY EITHER SIDE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE AN ORANGE PARK IN IRVINE IF THEY PREFER I AND I'M HERE SO I SUPPORT THAT NO I'M WHAT I'M ASKING YOU IS GIVEN THAT YOU'RE- EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE GOING TO BE BURIED THERE LEAST ASKING TO BE BURIED IN VETERANS CEMETERIES AND THAT THERE'S A LARGE KOREAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY IN IRVINE IN MY RIGHT YES THE- AND- THAT'S WHERE WE'VE SPENT TIME AND EFFORT STABLING CEMETERY I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND DO YOU SUPPORT A CEMETERY IN IRVINE. NEAR WHERE THE KOREAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY CREEK WHEN THERE'S A LARGE PORTION OF CREAM AMERICAN COMMUNITY OUR SUPPORT TO WHEREVER- ALSO PRACTICAL AND A VETERANS A ONE DOLLAR. RIGHT NOW WITH THE TREND US IT APPEARS TO ME I'M NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN WHICH YOU OF I CITY COUNCIL AT THIS TIME NATIONAL LAW SO THEY ARE- TAKING AN ACTION PLAN TO.

TEN IF YOU LAST QUESTION WHAT WOULD YOU CONSIDER AMENDING AG ARE TEN- TO. REQUEST A STUDY. TO FIND OUT EXACTLY. WHAT THE NUMBER OF. IN NOW THAT WE GOT. CREE AMERICANS FROM THE CRANK VIETNAM IT IS WELL AS VIETNAMESE DO TO FIGURE OUT HOW MANY WOULD BE BURIED IN STATE AND NATIONAL CEMETERY SO WE COULD FIGURE OUT WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE IN THE FUTURE IN TERMS OF DISPLACEMENT OF THOSE WHO ARE CURRENTLY IN THE U.

STATISTICS IS THE THAN THAT NONE NATIONAL HONOR- ORGANIZATIONS OF LIKE A CENSUS BUREAU MAY HAVE COME AND GONE AGAIN NOT A KOREAN CONFLICT THE VETERANS HOW MANY ARE CURRENTLY SURVIVING AND- IN THE U.
