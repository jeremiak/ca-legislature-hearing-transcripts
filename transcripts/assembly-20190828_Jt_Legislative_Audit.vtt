00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:41.305
AND IF A MALE TO BE LOWER OR

00:40:41.372 --> 00:40:42.807
HIGHER BASED UPON THAT THIS IS

00:40:42.873 --> 00:40:44.441
A PART OF YOUR BUSINESS IN

00:40:44.508 --> 00:40:45.543
CALIFORNIA AND SO I THINK THAT

00:40:45.609 --> 00:40:47.344
THAT'S WORTHWHILE BUT PROBABLY

00:40:47.411 --> 00:40:49.613
THE MAUVE ARCHING ISSUE IS THAT

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:50.214
SAN DIEGO HAS THE SIX FORCED

00:40:50.281 --> 00:40:51.448
AIR QUALITY IN THE UNITED

00:40:51.515 --> 00:40:53.784
STATES AND THAT'S A MAJOR

00:40:53.851 --> 00:40:55.853
CONCERN THAT IS A SCANDAL WORTH

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.454
LOOKING AT AND THIS IS THE

00:40:57.521 --> 00:40:58.956
AGENCY THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:40:59.023 --> 00:41:00.558
THE REGULATION OF THAT AND TO

00:41:00.624 --> 00:41:01.892
THE EXTENT THAT IT IS DIFFERENT

00:41:01.959 --> 00:41:03.327
THAN ITS COMPETITOR UP AIR

00:41:03.394 --> 00:41:04.495
POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICTS IN

00:41:04.562 --> 00:41:06.363
CALIFORNIA THIS IS THE NEED FOR

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:08.632
THE BILL BUT THE CHANCE PARENTS

00:41:08.699 --> 00:41:09.366
WERE TALKING ABOUT I THINK IS

00:41:09.433 --> 00:41:11.101
IMPORTANT. LASTLY SIR THIS IS

00:41:11.168 --> 00:41:13.637
PUBLIC MONEY IN SO I WOULD

00:41:13.704 --> 00:41:14.705
CHALLENGE ANY MEMBER OF THIS

00:41:14.772 --> 00:41:15.339
BOARD WHETHER NOT YOU WANT TO

00:41:15.406 --> 00:41:17.441
SIGN UP FOR MAKING IT HARDER TO

00:41:17.508 --> 00:41:18.776
ASCERTAIN WHERE THIS MONEY IS

00:41:18.843 --> 00:41:20.211
GOING WHAT'S COMING FROM AND

00:41:20.277 --> 00:41:21.679
WHERE IT'S GOING ON THIS AUDIT

00:41:21.745 --> 00:41:24.882
WOULD WOULD CORRECT THAT AND

00:41:24.949 --> 00:41:25.482
THAT WOULD BE VALUABLE WHETHER

00:41:25.549 --> 00:41:26.517
OR NOT THERE'S INDEPENDENT A

00:41:26.584 --> 00:41:28.586
PCD WITH A CONTINUES TO BE

00:41:28.652 --> 00:41:29.220
HOUSED WITHIN THE COUNTY OF SAN

WORST AIR IN CALIFORNIA I HAVE.

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:43.400
A SOFT SPOT FOR THIS TYPE OF

00:41:43.467 --> 00:41:48.239
ISSUE. I HAVEN'T SEEN FOR TWO

00:41:48.305 --> 00:41:48.806
THREE YET. I THINK IN THEORY

00:41:48.873 --> 00:41:49.940
THOUGH. I LIKE THE IDEA. OF

00:41:50.007 --> 00:41:52.009
INCLUDING. OTHER MUNICIPALITIES

00:41:52.076 --> 00:41:52.843
IN IMPACTED REGIONS. I THINK

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:55.145
THAT IS A HEALTHY THING. I

00:41:55.212 --> 00:41:58.249
THINK IT. WAS A BUT I GUESS YOU

00:41:58.315 --> 00:41:58.816
KNOW ALL ALL IN MY COMMENTS

00:41:58.883 --> 00:42:01.185
HERE THAT. IF WE WERE LOOKING

00:42:01.252 --> 00:42:03.087

00:42:14.899 --> 00:42:16.267
WHERE WE MAKE THAT INVESTMENT

00:42:16.333 --> 00:42:18.435
AND WITHOUT CONTROVERSY IN MY

00:42:18.502 --> 00:42:20.371
OPINION. I JUST DON'T SEE THE

00:42:20.437 --> 00:42:24.541

STRUCTURE. I'M ASSUMING WITH

00:44:08.746 --> 00:44:12.583
ALMOST 95% ASSUMPTION THAT IT

00:44:12.649 --> 00:44:15.386
WILL BENEFIT LARGE CITIES OVER

00:44:15.452 --> 00:44:17.788
THE SMALL CITIES UNDER THE

00:44:17.855 --> 00:44:19.256
CURRENT SANDBAGS SAN DIEGO

00:44:19.323 --> 00:44:22.760
ASSOCIATION OF. GOVERNMENTS

00:44:22.826 --> 00:44:26.730
IT'S A WAITED VOTE WHICH MEANS

00:44:26.797 --> 00:44:29.533
SAN DIEGO BASICALLY ALONG WITH

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:32.669
THE COUNTY DOMINATES. I BELIEVE

00:44:32.736 --> 00:44:36.774
THIS WOULD BE A WAITED VOTE.

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:38.475
ELIMINATING THE COUNTY TO SOME

00:44:38.542 --> 00:44:42.146

FROM THEIR DISTRICTS SO YOU

00:44:47.451 --> 00:44:52.022
HAVE DIVERSITY THERE. AND SAN

00:44:52.089 --> 00:44:52.589
DIEGO POLITICALLY IS TURNING

00:44:52.656 --> 00:44:57.261
BLUE. A BLUE SO THE BOARD OF

00:44:57.327 --> 00:44:59.296
SUPERVISORS IN FUTURE ELECTIONS

00:44:59.363 --> 00:44:59.863
ARE GOING TO BE TURNED OVER

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:04.468
ANYWAY. SO TO ME THIS HOLD. AB

00:45:04.535 --> 00:45:05.969
FOR TWENTY THREE STRUCTURE. IS

00:45:06.036 --> 00:45:12.176
NOT NEEDED. ALSO. THE AUDIENCE

00:45:12.242 --> 00:45:14.778

THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL BOARD.

00:45:25.923 --> 00:45:28.325
THIS AUDIT WOULD BE DUPLICATIVE

00:45:28.392 --> 00:45:32.229
OF THOSE EFFORTS ALSO I BELIEVE

00:45:32.296 --> 00:45:34.198
THAT IF A SIMPLE REQUEST IS

00:45:34.264 --> 00:45:36.700
MADE THEY WOULD BE MORE THAN

00:45:36.767 --> 00:45:39.369
GLAD TO COMPLY. VOLUNTARILY

00:45:39.436 --> 00:45:44.875

00:46:06.563 --> 00:46:09.466
BEFORE. AN AUDIT BY FOUR TWENTY

00:46:09.533 --> 00:46:15.005
THREE. IT'S ABSOLUTE OVER KILL.

00:46:15.072 --> 00:46:16.573

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:19.843
COMMENTS I HAD A QUESTION BUT

ADMINISTERED. A CURRENT

STATEMENT OF FUNDS AVAILABLE

00:51:12.436 --> 00:51:14.037
AND WARRANTED AND THE PROCESS

00:51:14.104 --> 00:51:15.505
BY WHICH THESE FUNDS ARE

00:51:15.572 --> 00:51:17.407
DETERMINED. NOW I DID HAVE A

00:51:17.474 --> 00:51:18.975
VERY HELPFUL MEETING WITH THE

00:51:19.042 --> 00:51:20.844
DEPARTMENT YESTERDAY AND MANY

00:51:20.911 --> 00:51:22.879
OF MY QUESTIONS WERE ANSWERED.

00:51:22.946 --> 00:51:25.849
BUT THEY RAISE MANY QUESTIONS

00:51:25.916 --> 00:51:28.618
ABOUT THE WHOLE PROCESS. I WILL

00:51:28.685 --> 00:51:30.787
SAY THAT IN LOOKING AT THEY

00:51:30.854 --> 00:51:32.756
SHOWED ME WHAT THE AWARDS WERE

00:51:32.823 --> 00:51:34.658
THEY SEEM TO GO TO QUITE

00:51:34.724 --> 00:51:36.560
REPUTABLE ORGANIZATIONS THAT'S

00:51:36.626 --> 00:51:39.095
GOOD. BUT WE DO NOT KNOW

00:51:39.162 --> 00:51:41.798
FRANKLY ANYTHING ABOUT HOW

00:51:41.865 --> 00:51:45.168
THESE WERE DETERMINED EVEN NOW.

00:51:45.235 --> 00:51:47.771
OF MAJOR REASON FOR THIS IS

00:51:47.838 --> 00:51:49.473
THAT THE MEMBERS OF THE

00:51:49.539 --> 00:51:52.442
COMMITTEE. THAT MAKE THIS

00:51:52.509 --> 00:51:56.246
DISPOSITION OF FUNDS IS SECRET.

00:51:56.313 --> 00:51:56.880
AND FURTHER THEIR DELIBERATIONS

00:51:56.947 --> 00:52:00.984
ARE SECRET. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:52:01.051 --> 00:52:01.551
FOUR HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND

00:52:01.618 --> 00:52:05.689
DOLLARS WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL.

00:52:05.755 --> 00:52:06.890
ALL OF YOU HAVE PROBABLY SERVED

00:52:06.957 --> 00:52:08.925
ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHERE YOU

00:52:08.992 --> 00:52:11.695
HAD APPOINTED GROUPS CITIZEN

00:52:11.761 --> 00:52:13.897
VOLUNTEERS WHO ARE MAKING

00:52:13.964 --> 00:52:16.700
DECISIONS WITH REGARD TO

00:52:16.766 --> 00:52:18.101
DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS FOR

00:52:18.168 --> 00:52:19.903
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF GIVING

00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:22.439
AWAY OF FEDERAL MONEY DECIDING

00:52:22.506 --> 00:52:24.674
WHICH NONPROFIT TO WOULD GO TO

00:52:24.741 --> 00:52:26.610
A PROPER PROCESS MOST LIKE

00:52:26.676 --> 00:52:28.178
THIS. WITH LARGE AMOUNTS OF

00:52:28.245 --> 00:52:30.247
MONEY ALWAYS HAD PLENTY OF

00:52:30.313 --> 00:52:32.682
VOLUNTEERS ALWAYS HAD A PUBLIC

00:52:32.749 --> 00:52:35.552
PROCESS. AND I THINK THAT'S ONE

00:52:35.619 --> 00:52:36.720
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS TO

00:52:36.786 --> 00:52:38.822
LOOK AT BECAUSE THE REASON WE

00:52:38.889 --> 00:52:40.524
WERE GIVEN FOR THIS IS WE DO

00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:42.659
THIS THROUGHOUT THE DEPARTMENT

00:52:42.726 --> 00:52:44.027
AT STANDARD FURTHER IT'S

00:52:44.094 --> 00:52:46.263
STANDARD THEY SAID IN MARCH OF

00:52:46.329 --> 00:52:47.898
THE STATE GOVERNMENT I REALLY

00:52:47.964 --> 00:52:49.666
THINK THIS HAS TO BE UNDERSTOOD

00:52:49.733 --> 00:52:52.903
EXTREMELY WELL IN IT HAS. RANMA

00:52:52.969 --> 00:52:54.938
IF THIS IS TRUE THAT THIS IS

00:52:55.005 --> 00:52:56.940
SOME STANDARD PROCEDURE THAT IS

00:52:57.007 --> 00:52:58.842
RAMIFICATIONS THROUGHOUT STATE

00:52:58.909 --> 00:53:00.911
GOVERNMENT SO THIS IS AN

00:53:00.977 --> 00:53:03.547
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF

00:53:03.613 --> 00:53:06.883
THE AUDIT. A SECOND I DID GET

00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:10.587
AGAIN THE ANSWERS TO MOST OF MY

00:53:10.654 --> 00:53:14.958
QUESTIONS YESTERDAY BUT. THESE

00:53:15.025 --> 00:53:16.026
THINGS NEED TO BE AVAILABLE AND

00:53:16.092 --> 00:53:17.894
TO THE PUBLIC AND THERE SIMPLY

00:53:17.961 --> 00:53:20.196
WASN'T A GOOD PROCESS FOR THAT

00:53:20.263 --> 00:53:20.764
SO WE HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT

00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:23.199
THEIR PROCESS SEES. THE THIRD

00:53:23.266 --> 00:53:25.869
POINT HERE IS THAT THIS BILL

00:53:25.936 --> 00:53:26.369
SPECIFICALLY CALLED FOR

00:53:26.436 --> 00:53:29.406
COLLABORATION. AND WHAT THIS

00:53:29.472 --> 00:53:31.074
COLLABORATION MEANS DOES IT

00:53:31.141 --> 00:53:34.010
MEAN THAT YOU EXCHANGE EMAILS

00:53:34.077 --> 00:53:36.813
AND WITH SOMEONE OR DOES IT

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:38.582
MEAN THAT YOU TAKE NOTE OF WHAT

00:53:38.648 --> 00:53:41.318
THEY'RE SAYING. SO AGAIN

00:53:41.384 --> 00:53:43.186
TALKING ABOUT COLLABORATION I

00:53:43.253 --> 00:53:44.421
THINK THIS IS AN EXTREMELY

00:53:44.487 --> 00:53:47.057
IMPORTANT AND AGAIN OF

00:53:47.123 --> 00:53:49.259
STATEWIDE ISSUE BECAUSE WE ARE

00:53:49.326 --> 00:53:51.828
ALL WAYS LOOKING FOR PUBLIC

00:53:51.895 --> 00:53:55.432
INPUT IN HOW WE DO THIS. SO I

00:53:55.498 --> 00:53:58.234
WOULD JUST SAY THAT. THIS IS AN

00:53:58.301 --> 00:53:59.803
IMPORTANT FOR THIS PARTICULAR

00:53:59.869 --> 00:54:01.571
PROGRAM BUT I WOULD SAY

00:54:01.638 --> 00:54:03.239
PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO THE

00:54:03.306 --> 00:54:04.975
SECRECY OF HOW THE FUNDS ARE

00:54:05.041 --> 00:54:08.244
GIVEN. THAT IS I THINK

00:54:08.311 --> 00:54:10.447
SOMETHING THAT WOULD REALLY

00:54:10.513 --> 00:54:11.014
NEEDS TO BE TAKEN TO A VERY

00:54:11.081 --> 00:54:13.883
CAREFUL LOOK AT. SO I REQUEST

00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:15.251

00:54:15.318 --> 00:54:16.920
COMMITTEE APPROVE THIS WITH THE

00:54:16.987 --> 00:54:19.322

THE RESULTS MAY BE AVAILABLE

00:54:21.625 --> 00:54:23.360
SHOULD ADDITIONAL CLARIFYING

LEGISLATION BE NEEDED NEXT YEAR.

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:30.400
AND I THINK THAT WELL AGAIN WE

00:54:30.467 --> 00:54:31.601
REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT THE

00:54:31.668 --> 00:54:34.004
SECRECY OF HOW THESE FUNDS ARE

00:54:34.070 --> 00:54:38.008

ACTUALLY HAVE THREE NON PROFITS

00:55:28.792 --> 00:55:31.127
AND ONE CAME UP OUT OF THIS.

00:55:31.194 --> 00:55:33.396
PROCESS THAT WE THAT DR DREW

00:55:33.463 --> 00:55:35.298
SEASON I STARTED IN TWO

00:55:35.365 --> 00:55:36.766
THOUSAND AND EIGHT AND TWO

00:55:36.833 --> 00:55:38.902
THOUSAND AND EIGHT. THE STATE

00:55:38.968 --> 00:55:40.403
OF CALIFORNIA HAS A PET

00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:42.672
OVERPOPULATION CRISIS AND WE

00:55:42.739 --> 00:55:44.307
KILL HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

00:55:44.374 --> 00:55:45.675

YEAR AND THESE ARE TAX PAYER

00:55:47.477 --> 00:55:50.213
DOLLARS SO IT'S A MORAL DEFICIT

00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:52.048
IT'S A FINANCIAL DEFICIT. AND

00:55:52.115 --> 00:55:54.784
SO ALLEN DR DREW SEASON I AND

OTHERS AROUND THE STATE SAID WE

00:55:56.586 --> 00:55:59.055
NEED A FUNDING MECHANISM THAT

00:55:59.122 --> 00:56:01.057
IS NOT FROM THE GOVERNMENT BUT

00:56:01.124 --> 00:56:03.493
A PUBLIC PRIVATE PROGRAM THEY

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:05.261
CAN BE A SUSTAINABLE FUNDING

00:56:05.328 --> 00:56:07.297
MECHANISM AND THAT THIS FUNDING

00:56:07.363 --> 00:56:11.501
MECHANISM BE 1100% TRANSPARENT.

00:56:11.568 --> 00:56:13.203

TO EVERYBODY THAT PUTS MONEY IN

00:56:14.971 --> 00:56:16.673
IT SO THE FIRST THING WE DID IS

00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:18.875
WE WENT TO THE BMB AND WE

00:56:18.942 --> 00:56:20.944
APPROACH THEM TO DO A LICENSE

00:56:21.010 --> 00:56:23.246
PLATE PROGRAM THEY SAID YES.

00:56:23.313 --> 00:56:24.714
WELL A LICENSE PLATE PROGRAM

00:56:24.781 --> 00:56:28.118

NINETEEN NINETY NINE BECAUSE OF

00:56:28.985 --> 00:56:32.622
A LAWSUIT. SO THEN WE WENT TO

00:56:32.689 --> 00:56:34.724
SENATOR PADILLA AT THAT TIME

00:56:34.791 --> 00:56:36.826
WHO THOUGHT HE NEEDED TO DO

00:56:36.893 --> 00:56:39.129
LEGISLATION TO HELP US BUT THEN

00:56:39.195 --> 00:56:42.065
THE DMV SAID NO. NO ALL THAT

00:56:42.132 --> 00:56:44.601
THIS NONPROFIT HAS TO DO IS

00:56:44.667 --> 00:56:47.370

01:11:40.696 --> 01:11:43.599
BIGGEST CONCERN ARM. WELL I'M

01:11:43.666 --> 01:11:44.900

MAYBE WE CAN SAVE SOME MONEY ON

01:12:06.522 --> 01:12:09.258
THE AUDIT I AGREE I THINK THAT

01:12:09.324 --> 01:12:11.226
THE LARGER QUESTION IS AS THE

01:12:11.293 --> 01:12:13.996
AUDITOR'S SAID HIS PROCESS. I

01:12:14.063 --> 01:12:15.397

OF THE INFORMATIONS ALREADY

01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:27.076
PRESENTED IT WOULD TAKE LESS

01:12:27.142 --> 01:12:28.677
STAFF TIME TO. TO GET THESE

01:12:28.744 --> 01:12:30.546
ANSWERS WHICH IN EFFECT WOULD

01:12:30.612 --> 01:12:34.383
LOWER THE COST PROBABLY OF THE

01:12:34.450 --> 01:12:34.950
ADDED MAYBE THE STAFF HOURS

01:12:35.017 --> 01:12:38.053
NEEDED. CERTAINLY MISTER CHAIR

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:39.054

01:12:39.121 --> 01:12:39.655
OBVIOUSLY I JUST SEEING THE

01:12:39.722 --> 01:12:41.190
LETTER NOW AND THERE IS

01:12:41.256 --> 01:12:41.957
INFORMATION A LETTER WHAT I

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:43.525
WOULD EXPECT MY STAFF TO DO IS.

01:12:43.592 --> 01:12:44.860
GO INTO THE FINANCIAL RECORDS

01:12:44.927 --> 01:12:46.462
TO VERIFY. WHAT THEY'RE

01:12:46.528 --> 01:12:47.663
ASSERTING IN THE LETTER BUT IF

01:12:47.730 --> 01:12:50.132
IT'S- IN FACT CORRECTED THAT IS

01:12:50.199 --> 01:12:51.433
GOING TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:52.735
TIME IT WOULD TAKE MY STAFF TO.

01:12:52.801 --> 01:12:54.236
TO COMPLETE CERTAIN OBJECTIVES

01:12:54.303 --> 01:12:56.138
ABSOLUTELY YEAH AND I'LL ALSO

01:13:08.317 --> 01:13:10.419
QUESTIONS. I THINK THE MAIN

01:13:10.486 --> 01:13:12.054
QUESTION HERE IS PROCESS RIGHT

01:13:12.121 --> 01:13:14.790
NOW. AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I'D

01:13:14.857 --> 01:13:16.425
LIKE TO EMPHASIZE AND I THINK

01:13:16.492 --> 01:13:17.226
THAT'S WHAT I HEARD IN THE

01:13:17.292 --> 01:13:18.327
TESTIMONY AS WELL AS A

01:13:18.393 --> 01:13:19.561

01:13:21.497 --> 01:13:23.465
ACTUALLY DONE IMPLEMENTED AND I

01:13:23.532 --> 01:13:24.700
KNOW THE PROGRAM'S FAIRLY.

01:13:24.767 --> 01:13:26.668
FAIRLY NEO I EVER SINCE THE

01:13:26.735 --> 01:13:30.706
NEWMAN LEGISLATION AS WELL SO.

01:13:30.773 --> 01:13:31.240
OKAY WITH THAT LET ME ASK

01:13:31.306 --> 01:13:31.807
THERE'S ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS

01:13:31.874 --> 01:13:35.310
FROM THE DíAS. SENATOR MORLOCK

01:13:35.377 --> 01:13:37.212
THE WOMAN SAID HER MONEY.

01:13:37.279 --> 01:13:38.680
MISTER CHAIR BACK TWENTY

01:13:38.747 --> 01:13:39.548
FIFTEEN WE HELD A HEARING WITH

01:13:39.615 --> 01:13:40.482
THE SENATE GOVERNANCE AND

01:13:40.549 --> 01:13:42.951
FINANCE COMMITTEE AND WE LOOKED

01:13:43.018 --> 01:13:44.553
AT THE VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS

01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:47.222
AND MONEY THAT WAS GOING BY THE

01:13:47.289 --> 01:13:48.557
CHECK OFF ON THE FORM FIVE

01:13:48.624 --> 01:13:50.192
FORTY AND- AND HOW THE

01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:51.260
CONTROLLER WAS SORT OF HOLDING

01:13:51.326 --> 01:13:54.496
ON TO THAT MONEY. I SEE THAT AS

01:13:54.563 --> 01:13:55.364
THE ISSUE HERE I THOUGHT MAYBE

01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:56.565
THE CONTROLLER COULD PROVIDE

01:13:56.632 --> 01:13:59.301
SOME MORE DETAILS AND IT SEEMS

01:13:59.368 --> 01:14:02.371
TO ME THAT. THE ISSUE IS JUST

01:14:02.437 --> 01:14:04.239
HOW ARE THE NONPROFIT SELECTED

01:14:04.306 --> 01:14:05.374
AND HOW'S THE MONEY

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:07.109
DISTRIBUTED. AND I'M I'M

WONDERING. HOW MANY.

01:14:09.812 --> 01:14:11.547
SPECIALIZED PLATES DO WE STILL

01:14:11.613 --> 01:14:14.183
HAVE BETTER. RECEIVING FUNDS

01:14:14.249 --> 01:14:15.651
AND SHOULD WE TAKE A HOLISTIC

01:14:15.717 --> 01:14:17.686
LOOK TO SEE. WHAT'S THE PROCESS

01:14:17.753 --> 01:14:20.255
FOR ALL OF THEM INSTEAD OF JUST

01:14:20.322 --> 01:14:22.925
ONE SO WE CAN. MAKE SURE WE

01:14:22.991 --> 01:14:23.492
HAVE YOU KNOW ABOUT A PUT AN

01:14:23.559 --> 01:14:26.461
APPROPRIATE. YOU KNOW

01:14:26.528 --> 01:14:27.496
TRANSPARENT RESPONSIBLE MANNER

01:14:27.563 --> 01:14:31.233
FOR GRANTING FUNDS TO ALL

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:31.800
NONPROFIT CENTER BENEFITING

01:14:31.867 --> 01:14:35.003
FROM THIS PROGRAM. AND I'M I'M

01:14:35.070 --> 01:14:36.205
JUST WONDERING ALSO WITH

01:14:36.271 --> 01:14:38.674
PERHAPS WE SHOULD REQUIRE MORE

01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:40.742
REPORTING TO THE LEGISLATURE ON

01:14:40.809 --> 01:14:41.944
AN ANNUAL REPORT ON WHERE'S

01:14:42.010 --> 01:14:44.379
THAT MONEY COMING. FROM AND HOW

01:14:44.446 --> 01:14:46.148
MUCH IS IT WHERE'S IT GOING IN

01:14:46.215 --> 01:14:47.950
I DON'T KNOW IF SPENDING TWO

01:14:48.016 --> 01:14:49.151
HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND

01:14:49.218 --> 01:14:49.952
DOLLARS ON AUDIT FOR SOMETHING

01:14:50.018 --> 01:14:52.221
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO GENERATE.

01:14:52.287 --> 01:14:52.855
FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND

01:14:52.921 --> 01:14:55.958
YEARS. I AFFECTED BUT I'D- LIKE

01:14:56.024 --> 01:14:57.125
TO GET THE WHOLE THING FIX NOT

01:14:57.192 --> 01:14:59.494
JUST. ONE SPECIFIC PLAY AND I

01:14:59.561 --> 01:15:01.663
THINK WHAT WE'RE IF YOU WANTED

01:15:01.730 --> 01:15:02.998
TO AUDIT ALL OF THEM THAT WOULD

01:15:03.065 --> 01:15:05.000
BE A LOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED

01:15:05.067 --> 01:15:06.368
FIFTY THOUSAND. I THINK IF WE

01:15:06.435 --> 01:15:09.004
CAN JUST AUDIT WINE. AND THEN

01:15:09.071 --> 01:15:10.439
YOU AND I CAN CO AUTHOR OF

01:15:10.505 --> 01:15:13.308
BAIL. TO TAKE TO SEE WHAT WE'VE

01:15:13.375 --> 01:15:15.978
LEARNED FROM THERE. AND START A

01:15:16.044 --> 01:15:18.480
PROCESS. AS HE SAID

01:15:18.547 --> 01:15:20.082
PARTICULARLY THE QUESTION FOR

01:15:20.148 --> 01:15:21.683
ME IS THE SELECTION OF THE

01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:23.118
COMMITTEES DOES THAT NEED

01:15:23.185 --> 01:15:25.420
REALLY NEED TO BE CONFIDENTIAL

01:15:25.487 --> 01:15:26.388
I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE'LL

01:15:26.455 --> 01:15:28.590
FIND OUT IN THE OFFICE. DID

01:15:28.657 --> 01:15:29.591
THEIR DELIBERATIONS NEED TO BE

01:15:29.658 --> 01:15:32.761
CONFIDENTIAL. AGAIN IF THIS IS

01:15:32.828 --> 01:15:35.631
A NORMAL PRACTICE IN THE STATE.

01:15:35.697 --> 01:15:36.899
THAT I THINK THAT THIS IS A

01:15:36.965 --> 01:15:39.268
STATE WIDE ISSUE WHEN YOU AND I

01:15:39.334 --> 01:15:40.669
CAN WORK ON IT TOGETHER I'D BE

01:15:40.736 --> 01:15:42.504
HONORED SO IMMIGRANT QUIRK.

01:15:42.571 --> 01:15:44.406
BECAUSE I THINK IF WE COULD

01:15:44.473 --> 01:15:45.674
NARROW IT TO THIS SPECIFIC

01:15:45.741 --> 01:15:47.109
ISSUE I THINK WE OUGHT TO BE.

01:15:47.175 --> 01:15:53.582
RATHER SIMPLE FOR ALL THE PLATE.

01:15:53.649 --> 01:15:58.487
A FULL LOOK GO AHEAD. IN ORDER

01:15:58.553 --> 01:16:00.923

SOME OF THE EXPENDITURES WERE

01:16:16.438 --> 01:16:17.873
NOT STE PROPERLY SUPPORTED SO

01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:19.041

THIS SECRET I AND ALSO THE

01:18:03.745 --> 01:18:04.746
DELIBERATIONS I THINK THAT'S

01:18:04.813 --> 01:18:06.782
SOMETHING YOU KNOW GOES WAY

01:18:06.848 --> 01:18:09.151
BEYOND LICENSE PLATES SO I

01:18:09.217 --> 01:18:09.785

01:18:09.851 --> 01:18:12.320
UNDERSTAND THIS PROGRAM AND

01:18:12.387 --> 01:18:13.722
WHETHER OR NOT THOSE CONDITIONS

CENTER MINING IT IT WOULD SAVE

01:19:38.006 --> 01:19:39.841
US SOME TIME I MEAN I THINK THE

I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE

01:19:42.177 --> 01:19:43.378
COMMITTEE IS SUGGESTING THAT

01:19:43.445 --> 01:19:45.413

THINK THAT WILL BE RELATIVELY

01:20:02.898 --> 01:20:04.232
QUICK WE CAN VERIFY THAT WHAT

01:20:04.299 --> 01:20:05.934

01:47:48.228 --> 01:47:51.531
ARE GONNA. EXCEPT FOR. SO HAVE

01:47:51.598 --> 01:47:53.300
SOME QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE

01:47:53.366 --> 01:47:56.937
ADDRESSED BY EITHER AN AUDIT OR

01:47:57.003 --> 01:47:57.571

FACILITIES AND THE LIKE SO. I

01:49:27.394 --> 01:49:27.961
WAS TAUGHT LAW SCHOOL TO ASK A

HAVE THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE

01:49:46.947 --> 01:49:49.015
IN THE DRAFTING OF THE

01:49:49.082 --> 01:49:49.616
QUESTIONS AS I'VE INDICATED TO

01:49:49.683 --> 01:49:53.420
THE- AND I'VE I THINK THAT ARE

01:49:53.486 --> 01:49:54.955
SOME QUESTIONS SUCH AS THE

01:49:55.021 --> 01:49:56.189
CONFLICT OF INTEREST QUESTION

QUESTION THAT ARE NOT REALLY

01:50:00.293 --> 01:50:03.530
RELEVANT TO MY CONCERNS. AND I

01:50:03.596 --> 01:50:06.066
WOULD PREFER THAT THOUGH. BUT

01:50:06.132 --> 01:50:08.134
IT BUT I DO THINK THAT THE OVER.

01:50:08.201 --> 01:50:08.635
ISSUES OF CLINICAL SLOT

01:50:08.702 --> 01:50:11.271
AVAILABILITY. HOW WE RESTRICT

01:50:11.338 --> 01:50:14.007
ENROLLMENT AND BY THE WAY THE

PRIVATE SCHOOLS STEPPED UP. IN

01:50:14.874 --> 01:50:16.142
THE PUBLIC SCHOOL. WHEN

01:50:16.209 --> 01:50:19.679
SUFFICIENT. AND I THINK THAT'S

01:50:19.746 --> 01:50:22.482
IMPORTANT TO NOTE AND HOW WE

01:50:22.549 --> 01:50:24.250
RESTRICT AND ROMAN TO THAT THE

01:50:24.317 --> 01:50:26.653
PRIVATE SCHOOLS OF ONE WE CAN'T

01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:28.455
GRADUATE ENOUGH IN OUR PUBLIC

01:50:28.521 --> 01:50:32.826
PROGRAM. AT A TIME WHEN WE HAVE

01:50:32.892 --> 01:50:35.628
SHORTAGES AROUND THE STATE. SO

01:50:35.695 --> 01:50:38.131
I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS. THE

01:50:38.198 --> 01:50:39.232
AUDIT I WOULD ASK AND I'M SURE

01:50:39.299 --> 01:50:39.866

SOME OF THE QUESTIONS AND

01:50:44.871 --> 01:50:48.108
BETTER THAN THE OTHER REQUEST.

01:50:48.174 --> 01:50:48.675
BUT I LOOK FORWARD THE AUDIT

01:50:48.742 --> 01:50:50.443

01:51:31.718 --> 01:51:33.620
THINKING A LITTLE ABOUT THE

01:51:33.686 --> 01:51:35.955
BUREAUCRACY IN A LITTLE LESS

01:51:36.022 --> 01:51:37.390
ABOUT WHETHER THERE'S A

01:51:37.457 --> 01:51:38.024
SHORTAGE OF WHETHER THERE IS A

01:51:38.091 --> 01:51:39.893
SHORTAGE OBVIOUSLY THERE IS

01:51:39.959 --> 01:51:43.596
AMPLE EVIDENCE THAT THEIR

01:51:43.663 --> 01:51:44.230
SHORTAGES IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA

01:51:44.297 --> 01:51:46.499
INTO THE NIGHT. IS BIG RECALL

01:51:46.566 --> 01:51:47.100
WITH THOSE OF US WHO REPRESENT

01:51:47.167 --> 01:51:49.102
THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. SUGGEST

01:51:49.169 --> 01:51:50.170
THAT WE NEED TO BE THINKING.

01:51:50.236 --> 01:51:50.970
ABOUT STUDENTS. WHO HAVE A

01:51:51.037 --> 01:51:56.209
PASSION. WHO OFTENTIMES GO INTO

01:51:56.276 --> 01:52:00.146

THE B. R. N. TO ESSENTIALLY BE

01:52:02.816 --> 01:52:04.851
THE GATEKEEPER TO THEIR

OPPORTUNITY A GATEKEEPER TO

01:52:06.986 --> 01:52:12.158
THEIR DREAMS ARE I THINK YEAH.

01:52:12.225 --> 01:52:14.561
RAISES THE REAL QUESTION WE'RE

01:52:14.627 --> 01:52:17.464
NOT BE IRAN IS ACTUALLY.

01:52:17.530 --> 01:52:20.400

01:52:24.070 --> 01:52:25.638
HAS NO BUSINESS GETTING INTO.

01:52:25.705 --> 01:52:28.408
BUT LET'S STIPULATE FOR THAT

01:52:28.475 --> 01:52:30.777
THERE MAY OR MAY NOT BE A

01:52:30.844 --> 01:52:40.487
SHORTAGE. THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE

01:52:40.553 --> 01:52:44.324

FOR. AND THAT THEY WANT TO DO.

01:52:55.135 --> 01:52:57.203
DOES IT MATTER WHETHER OR NOT

01:52:57.270 --> 01:52:59.372
THERE IS A SHORTAGE HERE. I

01:52:59.439 --> 01:53:02.709

REVIEW HAS ACTUALLY THE

02:00:15.508 --> 02:00:17.410
AUTHORITY IN THE OPPORTUNITY TO

THE JUMP START BY GETTING SOME

02:00:32.158 --> 02:00:33.759
INFORMATION BUT THE SUNSET

02:00:33.826 --> 02:00:34.393
REVIEW PROCESS IS GOING TO PLAY

02:00:34.460 --> 02:00:35.294
OUT. I'M AND THAT WILL BEGIN

02:00:35.361 --> 02:00:36.195
THE PREPARATION FOR THAT WILL

02:00:36.262 --> 02:00:39.632
BEGIN I BELIEVE NEXT YEAR. SO

02:00:39.699 --> 02:00:41.834
AM I AM CONFLICTED AND OUT BY

02:00:41.901 --> 02:00:43.369
THAT I AM OBVIOUSLY HAD BEEN A

02:00:43.436 --> 02:00:44.570
HUGE PROPOSED FOR WORKFORCE

02:00:44.637 --> 02:00:45.805
DEVELOPMENT BUT ALSO WONDER TOO

02:00:45.871 --> 02:00:48.374
IT'S PART OF THIS ISSUE AND I

02:00:48.441 --> 02:00:51.744
DON'T KNOW. I'M NOT AN EXPERT

02:00:51.811 --> 02:00:54.180
ON THE BOARD'S AUTHORITY ON

THIS. BUT YOU WONDER YOU KNOW.

02:00:58.351 --> 02:01:01.921
WHEN SHE IS. ARE THERE ARE

02:01:01.988 --> 02:01:04.790
THERE CLINICAL SO THAT'S TO PUT.

02:01:04.857 --> 02:01:06.759
SO FOR EXAMPLE. A RESIDENCY

02:01:06.826 --> 02:01:08.060
PROGRAMS HERE IN CALIFORNIA FOR

02:01:08.127 --> 02:01:09.829
TENNIS RIGHT NOW. FOR FAMILY

02:01:09.895 --> 02:01:10.329
PRACTICE RESIDENCIES AND

02:01:10.396 --> 02:01:11.564
PRIMARY CARE. AND THERE REALLY

02:01:11.631 --> 02:01:13.032
AREN'T A LOT OF SLOTS FOR THOSE

02:01:13.099 --> 02:01:14.467
RESIDENCY PROGRAMS. PART

02:01:14.533 --> 02:01:14.967
BECAUSE THEY ARE HUGELY

02:01:15.034 --> 02:01:16.268
EXPENSIVE. THERE HE IS

02:01:16.335 --> 02:01:17.336
EXPENSIVE TO RUN AND TO

02:01:17.403 --> 02:01:20.072
MAINTAIN. SO HOSPITALS IN AND

02:01:20.139 --> 02:01:24.110
PLACES THAT ARE GOING TO BE

02:01:24.176 --> 02:01:24.677
PLATE IT PARTICIPATE IN THE

02:01:24.744 --> 02:01:27.046
EDUCATION NURSES. I JUST DON'T

02:01:27.113 --> 02:01:28.280
KNOW IF WE ARE MAXED OUT ON

02:01:28.347 --> 02:01:29.949
THAT OR IF THERE IS IF THERE IS

02:01:30.016 --> 02:01:31.684
AN ISSUE WITH THAT AND THAT IS

02:01:31.751 --> 02:01:33.319
THAT WHY THE BOARD BUT BOARD IS

02:01:33.386 --> 02:01:35.154
ENTERTAINING. BUT I DO BELIEVE

02:01:35.221 --> 02:01:35.721
THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WOULD

02:01:35.788 --> 02:01:36.255
ALSO COME OUT AND SET TO

02:01:36.322 --> 02:01:37.189

THAT. BECAUSE YOU ARE CORRECT

02:01:41.994 --> 02:01:42.528
BUT THE I DID WOULD IDENTIFY

02:01:42.595 --> 02:01:44.630
THAT IT. AYE AND SUB ONE A WITH

02:01:44.697 --> 02:01:45.331
YOU WE'VE ALWAYS PUSHED FOR

02:01:45.398 --> 02:01:46.932
ADDITIONAL MONIES SPECIFIC IN

02:01:46.999 --> 02:01:48.601
THE AND THEN OUR CASE FOR

02:01:48.668 --> 02:01:53.305
DOCTORS ON TO BE PLAYED AND I

02:01:53.372 --> 02:01:56.075
THINK THAT THE AUDITOR CAM. A

02:01:56.142 --> 02:02:00.413
GROUP. OF BETTER INTEREST. OF

02:02:00.479 --> 02:02:06.819
ISN'T AN. BOB WHAT I. NUMBER OF

02:02:06.886 --> 02:02:09.155
THE SUB COMMITTEE AND- SERVICES

02:02:17.329 --> 02:02:18.898
AND I THINK THE AUDIT. WOULD

02:02:18.964 --> 02:02:20.032
IDENTIFY THAT I. HAVE BEEN

02:02:20.099 --> 02:02:20.966
WORKING NOW WITH THE AUDITOR

02:02:48.360 --> 02:02:49.361
BASIS THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT

02:02:49.428 --> 02:02:49.995
TO HAVE THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR

02:02:50.062 --> 02:02:51.330

BRANDS AND ONE OF THE REASONS

02:04:15.414 --> 02:04:17.683
IS THAT THERE IS NOT ENOUGH

02:04:17.750 --> 02:04:19.385
ACCESS AND PART OF THAT ACTS AS

02:04:19.451 --> 02:04:22.087
A- OF THE- BACK OF. THE END AND

02:04:22.154 --> 02:04:22.922
YOU POINT OUT REALLY GOOD

02:04:22.988 --> 02:04:24.190
THINGS AND I DON'T DISAGREE

02:04:24.256 --> 02:04:25.724
WITH ANY OF THAT BUT HOW DO YOU

02:04:25.791 --> 02:04:28.694
GET PEOPLE. TO THOSE

02:04:28.761 --> 02:04:33.966
COMMUNITIES. HOW DO YOU GET

02:04:34.033 --> 02:04:34.433
WELL TRAINED IN THOSE

02:04:34.500 --> 02:04:40.739
COMMUNITIES BIG. AND ACT AS A

02:04:40.806 --> 02:04:45.377
SHIP FROM UP OUR WAY. PROGRAM

02:04:45.444 --> 02:04:47.580
AS A TEACHER AND WORKED FOR

02:04:47.646 --> 02:04:48.848
FIVE YEARS AND UNDERSERVED

02:04:48.914 --> 02:04:55.721
COMMUNITY PART OF MY FINANCIAL.

02:04:55.788 --> 02:04:57.456
THAT WAS WAS RELIEVED WITH THAT

02:04:57.523 --> 02:04:59.058
UPPER GRAND SO THAT WOULD GIVE

02:04:59.124 --> 02:05:00.459
US AN OPPORTUNITY TO PERHAPS DO

02:05:00.526 --> 02:05:02.528
A GRANT LIKE THAT FOR THOSE

02:05:02.595 --> 02:05:04.964
COMMUNITIES IF THEY MOVED INTO

02:05:05.030 --> 02:05:05.865
THIS COMMUNITIES AND PROVIDE

02:05:05.931 --> 02:05:07.967
THE ACCESS FOR THEM IS OUT OF

02:05:08.033 --> 02:05:09.201
SCOPE OF THE AUDIT BUT IT IS

02:05:09.268 --> 02:05:10.269
OUT OF SCHOOL BUT THE ADDED BUT

02:05:10.336 --> 02:05:12.771
AGAIN WITH THE I DID WE WOULD

02:05:12.838 --> 02:05:14.273
FIND OUT SPECIFICALLY WHAT'S

02:05:14.340 --> 02:05:15.441
HAPPENING. THAT'S SOMETHING

02:05:15.507 --> 02:05:17.977
THAT WE HAVE TO PUSH FOR

02:05:18.043 --> 02:05:19.378
EXAMPLE TO BOB PROVIDED IN A

02:05:19.445 --> 02:05:21.213
MONIES I SEE IT AS AN UP

02:05:21.280 --> 02:05:23.115
OVERVIEW OF EVERYTHING HOW ARE

02:05:23.182 --> 02:05:24.984
WE GOING TO PROVIDE NURSES FOR

02:05:25.050 --> 02:05:27.519
THOSE COMMUNITIES AND THE ODD

02:05:27.586 --> 02:05:28.454
IT WOULD AT LEAST GIVE US THE

02:05:28.520 --> 02:05:30.022
BASED OUT OF WHAT THE PROBLEMS

02:05:30.089 --> 02:05:32.458
ARE AND IF THERE'S NO PROBLEMS

02:05:32.524 --> 02:05:37.463
THEN THEN. I WOULD BE THE FIRST

02:05:37.529 --> 02:05:37.997
ONE TO SEND OUT OF A PRESS

02:05:38.063 --> 02:05:41.800
RELEASE TO. AND B. R. N. FOR

02:05:41.867 --> 02:05:44.069
THEIR WORK BUT IF THERE'S

02:05:44.136 --> 02:05:44.670
ISSUES THAT COME UP THAT THE

02:05:44.737 --> 02:05:45.604
AUDITOR CAN BE. TOO THEN I

02:05:45.671 --> 02:05:46.705
WOULD BE OPEN TO THAT SO THAT

02:05:46.772 --> 02:05:48.841
WE CAN PROVIDE ACCESS AGAIN.

02:05:48.908 --> 02:05:49.875
NOT JUST THE TALLY COUNTY I'M

02:05:49.942 --> 02:05:50.943
FROM LA COUNTY I'M GOOD I

02:05:51.010 --> 02:05:51.577
NEIGHBORS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE

02:05:51.644 --> 02:05:52.845
NOT GOOD. AND SO I WANT TO MAKE

02:05:52.912 --> 02:05:53.979
SURE THAT WE HAVE ACCESS FOR

02:05:54.046 --> 02:05:58.651
ALL. AND AGAIN I MET WITH THE-

02:05:58.717 --> 02:05:59.752
FARMWORKERS YES THEY AND THEY

02:05:59.818 --> 02:06:01.520
DON'T HAVE ANY ACCESS. NOW

02:06:01.587 --> 02:06:03.756
THAT'S A WHOLE YOU'RE RIGHT IT

02:06:03.822 --> 02:06:05.157
IS OUTSIDE OF THE SCOPE OF THE

02:06:05.224 --> 02:06:06.592
AUDIT. BUT I DID. WAS CREATE

02:06:06.659 --> 02:06:08.694
EITHER LEGISLATION. GRAHAM'S

02:06:08.761 --> 02:06:10.396
THAT WOULD INCENTIVIZE THESE

02:06:10.462 --> 02:06:11.597
THESE FOLKS MAYBE FROM ALLEY.

02:06:11.664 --> 02:06:12.998
THE CENTER THAT I THINK WE MOVE

02:06:13.065 --> 02:06:16.936
TOWARDS THAT I THINK WE ALL.

02:06:17.002 --> 02:06:19.171
WANT ADDITIONAL ACCESS IS

02:06:19.238 --> 02:06:19.738
TRYING TO PROVE THAT BELIEVE

02:06:19.805 --> 02:06:26.445
MR. THING ABOUT. THE EFFORT

02:06:26.512 --> 02:06:31.216
COAST WITH. ONE IN. CONTROL.

02:06:31.283 --> 02:06:31.750
WELL REALLY DISCUSSING AND

02:06:31.817 --> 02:06:33.485
WHETHER THE SCOPE. IT WILL

02:06:33.552 --> 02:06:35.621
HELP. PRESS OF THAT WHETHER

02:06:35.688 --> 02:06:37.022
FUTURE POLICY CONCERNS AND SUB

02:06:37.089 --> 02:06:37.790
ONE ARE OF POLICY COMMITTEE OR

02:06:37.856 --> 02:06:38.891
FUTURE LEGISLATION. RIGHT WITH

02:06:38.958 --> 02:06:39.658
THAT I DON'T KNOW. QUESTION

02:06:39.725 --> 02:06:40.826
MISTER WOOD OR JUST SAY THAT

02:06:40.893 --> 02:06:41.427
YOU KNOW I PROBABLY WON'T BE

02:06:41.493 --> 02:06:42.227
SUPPORTING THE ADDED TODAY

02:06:42.294 --> 02:06:43.362
BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE HAVE

02:06:43.429 --> 02:06:44.396
ANOTHER PROCESS IS CALLED

02:06:44.463 --> 02:06:46.231
SUNSET REVIEW. AND WHICH WOULD

02:06:46.298 --> 02:06:48.867
BE UP I'M A VERY BROAD. LENGTHY

02:06:48.934 --> 02:06:50.169
PROCESS THAT WOULD GIVE THE

02:06:50.235 --> 02:06:51.937
EVERYBODY OPPORTUNITY GET A LOT

02:06:52.004 --> 02:06:53.138
OF THE ANSWERS YOU'RE ASKING

02:06:53.205 --> 02:06:53.672
FOR US I'M NOT SAYING THAT

02:06:53.739 --> 02:06:55.307
THERE'S NOT A NEED FOR MORE

02:06:55.374 --> 02:06:57.309
INFORMATION. BY THE SAME I

02:06:57.376 --> 02:07:03.549
THINK WE. ARE WE HAVE A PROCESS

02:07:03.615 --> 02:07:04.183
THAT THAT WE CAN COMPLETE YOUR-

02:07:04.249 --> 02:07:08.454
SIDE. THANKS BIRD. YOU KNOW I'M

02:07:08.520 --> 02:07:09.555
COMING OF THIS WITH A PROBABLY

02:07:09.621 --> 02:07:09.989
A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

02:07:10.055 --> 02:07:10.622
PERSPECTIVE ON THE FIRST DAY I

02:07:10.689 --> 02:07:11.590
WAS. INTO THE ASSEMBLY. I HAD A

02:07:11.657 --> 02:07:12.925
FOR PROFIT NURSING COLLEGE AND

02:07:12.992 --> 02:07:15.094
MY DISTRICT CLOSE. AND SO

02:07:15.160 --> 02:07:16.328
LEARNED CASE WORK UP RIGHT OFF

02:07:16.395 --> 02:07:16.895
THE BAT BEFORE I EVEN HAVE.

02:07:16.962 --> 02:07:17.529
USED TO MY DISTRICT OFFICE. AND

02:07:17.596 --> 02:07:19.064
WE HAD CONSTITUENTS THAT DIDN'T

02:07:19.131 --> 02:07:20.065
HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR

02:07:20.132 --> 02:07:22.501
TRANSCRIPTS. THAT COULDN'T MOVE

02:07:22.568 --> 02:07:23.869
THAT YOU KNOW THAT WOULD CARRY

02:07:23.936 --> 02:07:25.671
THE STUDENT LOAN THEY DIDN'T

02:07:25.738 --> 02:07:27.272
KNOW HOW TO DISCHARGED ALONE.

02:07:27.339 --> 02:07:30.109
SO WHEN I LOOKED AT THIS AUDIT

02:07:30.175 --> 02:07:30.943
WHAT I LOOK THAT FROM THE

02:07:31.010 --> 02:07:33.178
PERSPECTIVE IS THAT ON A QUAN.

02:07:33.245 --> 02:07:39.051
QUESTION HOW. ARE THEY.

02:07:39.118 --> 02:07:39.651
OFFICIALLY CLOSED. NOW PLAYING

02:07:39.718 --> 02:07:42.321
THE SLOT ALL THIS STUFF.

02:07:42.388 --> 02:07:43.322
COMPLETELY LACKING FOR ME IS

02:07:43.389 --> 02:07:45.858
THE QUALITY OF THE PROGRAMS.

02:07:45.924 --> 02:07:47.026
RIGHT SO THAT'S WHAT WE KNOW.

02:07:47.092 --> 02:07:48.260
AT AND THERE MIGHT NOT BE AN

02:07:48.327 --> 02:07:49.595
OPTION TO CHANGE THE SCOPE IN

02:07:49.661 --> 02:07:50.329
WHICH CASE I'M UNFORTUNATELY

02:07:50.396 --> 02:07:51.630
CAN'T. SUPPORT THE ON IT TODAY.

02:07:51.697 --> 02:07:52.431
BUT FOR ME WE SHOULD BE REALLY

02:07:52.498 --> 02:07:53.065
LOOKING AT. YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE

02:07:53.132 --> 02:07:55.768
ASKING THESE QUESTIONS. ARE THE

02:07:55.834 --> 02:07:56.301
COMPLAINTS COMING FROM FOR

02:07:56.368 --> 02:08:00.372
PROFIT. FIVE IT OF COTTON

02:08:00.439 --> 02:08:01.306
COLLEGES ARE THEY COMING FROM

02:08:01.373 --> 02:08:02.574
NONPROFIT PROTOCOL IS ARE THEY

02:08:02.641 --> 02:08:04.443
COMING FROM OUR PUBLIC COLLEGES

02:08:04.510 --> 02:08:05.244
WHERE THE COMPLAINTS COMING

02:08:05.310 --> 02:08:07.279
FROM. YOU KNOW WHAT WE LOOK AT

02:08:07.346 --> 02:08:09.114
THE NUMBER OF SLOTS AND WE LOOK

02:08:09.181 --> 02:08:11.116
AT THE CREDIT A YOU KNOW THE

02:08:11.183 --> 02:08:13.185
HOW HOW THE B. R. AND-

02:08:13.252 --> 02:08:15.254
EVALUATES PROGRAMS. HOWEVER

02:08:15.320 --> 02:08:17.790
THEY EVALUATING QUALITY THE

02:08:17.856 --> 02:08:20.692
COST TO THE PROGRAM YOU KNOW

02:08:20.759 --> 02:08:21.326
HOW MUCH THAT OUR FOLKS REALLY

02:08:21.393 --> 02:08:21.960
GONNA LEAVE WITH SOME OF THESE

02:08:22.027 --> 02:08:23.395
PROGRAMS. IS WHAT THEIR CONTROL

02:08:23.462 --> 02:08:27.466
OF LIFELONG EARNING IS. SO I

02:08:27.533 --> 02:08:30.769
THINK. IF WE'RE GONNA AUDIT.

02:08:30.836 --> 02:08:32.171
ABOARD WE SHOULD DO IT

02:08:32.237 --> 02:08:33.472
COMPREHENSIVELY I THINK SENATOR

02:08:33.539 --> 02:08:34.039
ROTH IS BROUGHT UP SOME HIS

02:08:34.106 --> 02:08:35.908
CONCERNS. AND I HAVE THE

02:08:35.974 --> 02:08:36.475
CONCERNED ABOUT QUALITY OF

02:08:36.542 --> 02:08:36.942
WHICH I DON'T FULLER

02:08:37.009 --> 02:08:40.479
ADEQUATELY. ON INCLUDED HERE

02:08:40.546 --> 02:08:44.016
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. THE. WHEN

02:08:44.083 --> 02:08:45.751
WE TALK ABOUT SORRY I'M OVER

02:08:45.818 --> 02:08:47.553
FORTY SO I HAVE TO TAKE OFF MY

02:08:47.619 --> 02:08:50.322
GLASSES WE TALK ABOUT. SOME OF

02:08:50.389 --> 02:08:52.357
THE SLOTS THAT WE'RE TALKING

02:08:52.424 --> 02:08:54.760
ABOUT. I WONDER ABOUT THE

02:08:54.827 --> 02:08:57.029
PROVISION OF THE SLOTS AS

02:08:57.096 --> 02:08:58.397
ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT IS

02:08:58.464 --> 02:08:59.965
MENTIONED AND WHAT DOES THAT

02:09:00.032 --> 02:09:01.733
MEAN AND I HAD HEARD AND THOUGH

02:09:01.800 --> 02:09:02.835
I DON'T HAVE THE IDEA VERIFY

02:09:02.901 --> 02:09:04.937
THIS. SOME PEOPLE WITH SOME

02:09:05.003 --> 02:09:05.804
ORGANIZATIONS CAN GIVE

02:09:05.871 --> 02:09:07.372
DONATIONS TO GET MORE ACCESS TO

02:09:07.439 --> 02:09:08.841
THE SPOTS HOW'S THAT AFFECTING

02:09:08.907 --> 02:09:11.477
THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. SO I THINK

02:09:11.543 --> 02:09:12.778
IF WE'RE GONNA YOU KNOW I

02:09:12.845 --> 02:09:15.114
BASICALLY THINK YOU KNOW WE

02:09:15.180 --> 02:09:16.682
SHOULD ON EVERYBODY THE STATE

02:09:16.748 --> 02:09:17.749
THAT'S LIKE MY GENERAL RULE.

02:09:17.816 --> 02:09:19.351
BUT IT'S GOING TO AUDIT THEM WE

02:09:19.418 --> 02:09:21.820
SHOULD COMPREHENSIVELY AND

02:09:21.887 --> 02:09:24.990
INCLUDES QUESTIONS FROM SENATOR

02:09:25.057 --> 02:09:29.161
ROTH SOME OF THE MONTH. THAT I

02:09:29.228 --> 02:09:31.430
HAVE A QUALITY OF PROGRAMS.

02:09:31.497 --> 02:09:33.098
MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE A PATH

02:09:33.165 --> 02:09:34.666
TO A JOB. AND IF THAT'S BEST

02:09:34.733 --> 02:09:36.702
DONE IN A COMPREHENSIVE. REVIEW

02:09:36.768 --> 02:09:37.336
FORMAT Vì THE SON OF VIA THE

02:09:37.402 --> 02:09:38.337

02:09:43.342 --> 02:09:45.911
BECAUSE WE DO HAVE WE DO NEED

FOR JOBS THAT ARE REALLY.

02:09:53.385 --> 02:09:55.921
ADDING TO THE HEALTH AND OF OUR

02:09:55.988 --> 02:09:58.056
COMMUNITIES SO I APPLAUD THE

02:10:01.593 --> 02:10:05.264
MOMENT WE'RE ALL WATCHING IT

02:10:05.330 --> 02:10:07.332
BUT I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A

02:10:07.399 --> 02:10:12.104
SCOPE HERE THAN. WHAT'S

02:10:12.171 --> 02:10:17.442

OF COMPLAINTS FROM PEOPLE BEEN

02:10:32.591 --> 02:10:33.792
HELD UP IN THE LICENSING

02:10:33.859 --> 02:10:36.562
PROCESS SOME FROM OUT OF STATE

02:10:36.628 --> 02:10:38.263
WHO COME INTO CALIFORNIA OTHERS

02:10:38.330 --> 02:10:39.731
WHO GRADUATED FROM OUR

INSTITUTIONS. AND OTHERS IN ON

02:10:41.633 --> 02:10:43.936
IT AND TWENTY SIXTEEN I BELIEVE

02:10:44.002 --> 02:10:45.170
ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND

02:10:45.237 --> 02:10:46.939
THAT THERE HAS BEEN IMPROVEMENT

02:10:47.005 --> 02:10:50.609
OF BACKLOG IN IN FORWARD

02:10:50.676 --> 02:10:52.644

BOARD FOR. THAT I DO SHARE SOME

02:10:57.916 --> 02:10:59.218
OF THE CONCERNS. RAISED BY DR

WOODS IN OTHERS. ABOUT THE

02:11:03.188 --> 02:11:03.655
SCOPE OF THIS ON IT IN THE

02:11:03.722 --> 02:11:08.760
TIMING. I THINK IT THE CORN IN

02:11:08.827 --> 02:11:11.063
ASSEMBLY MEMBER HAVE TOUCHED ON.

02:11:11.129 --> 02:11:11.930
I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS

02:11:11.997 --> 02:11:14.132
SOME CONFLICT BETWEEN PUBLIC

02:11:14.199 --> 02:11:15.500
INSTITUTIONS OR PRIVATE

02:11:15.567 --> 02:11:18.136

COUNTY I THINK WHERE I HAVE A

02:17:46.424 --> 02:17:48.360
BIT OF A CONFLICT WITH THIS

02:17:48.426 --> 02:17:50.795
AUDIT IS THAT IT'S NOT

02:17:50.862 --> 02:17:52.530
NECESSARILY NELLY COUNTY AS WE

02:17:52.597 --> 02:17:53.898

02:17:58.203 --> 02:17:58.737
COLLEAGUES HAVE MENTIONED AS

02:17:58.803 --> 02:17:59.904
WELL AND I KNOW THAT.

02:17:59.971 --> 02:18:02.073
SPECIFICALLY WITH LONG BEACH

02:18:02.140 --> 02:18:03.141
THE AREA I REPRESENT COMING

02:18:03.208 --> 02:18:05.810
FROM THAT LENDS. A LONG WHICH

CITY COLLEGE WROTE IN

02:18:06.745 --> 02:18:09.881
OPPOSITION THERE WERE EIGHT

NURSING PROGRAM BUT VERY FEW

02:18:13.251 --> 02:18:16.321
SLOW. IN THE AREA. AND MAYBE IT

02:18:16.388 --> 02:18:18.390
MAYBE IS THERE AN ADN PROGRAM A

02:18:18.456 --> 02:18:22.427
FEW DIFFERENT ELEMENTS BUT-

02:18:22.494 --> 02:18:25.163
THEY'RE VEHEMENTLY OPPOSE.

02:18:25.230 --> 02:18:28.166
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:18:28.233 --> 02:18:32.370
THAT. MORTGAGE HOSPITAL SITE IS

02:18:32.437 --> 02:18:39.744
SLEEP. ANY I'M SPOT HERE AND IS

02:18:39.811 --> 02:18:41.780

YOU KNOW IT WITH LONG BEACH IN

02:18:42.714 --> 02:18:43.448
ADDITION TO HAVING A DâN

02:18:43.515 --> 02:18:44.482
PROGRAM AND THE SHORTAGE OF

02:18:44.549 --> 02:18:45.884
SLOTS WE ALSO THE HOSPITAL

02:18:45.950 --> 02:18:46.351
CLOSURE WHICH ADDS AND

02:18:46.418 --> 02:18:47.218
COMPOUNDS TO THE ISSUE. AND SO

02:18:47.285 --> 02:18:47.819
FOR ME IT'S A LITTLE DIFFICULT

02:18:47.886 --> 02:18:48.820
TO SUPPORT AUDIT WHERE WE HAVE

02:18:48.887 --> 02:18:51.623

02:18:52.824 --> 02:18:54.492
THAT. I AM SO WHAT I WOULD JUST

02:18:54.559 --> 02:18:56.561
SAY IS YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO UP

02:18:56.628 --> 02:18:57.195
AND WORK CLOSELY WITH SENSIBLE

02:18:57.262 --> 02:18:58.797
PROGRAMS THAT WE OF COURSE TO

02:18:58.863 --> 02:18:59.397
STREAMLINE AND MAKE SURE THAT

02:18:59.464 --> 02:19:00.965
WE'RE GETTING. SLOTS IN AREAS

02:19:01.032 --> 02:19:03.368
LIKE LA COUNTY AND THEN ALSO

02:19:03.435 --> 02:19:05.070
LOOK AT SHORTAGE IS FOR NURSING

02:19:05.136 --> 02:19:07.305
AND OTHER AREAS LIKE CENTRAL

02:19:07.372 --> 02:19:07.872
VALLEY SO I THINK THERE'S A

PARTY BEING THE STATE AUDITOR

02:21:12.831 --> 02:21:14.032
TAKING A LOOK AT THESE

02:21:14.098 --> 02:21:15.633
QUESTIONS IN TRYING TO RESOLVE

02:21:15.700 --> 02:21:17.302
SOME OF THESE ISSUES SAID OF

02:21:17.368 --> 02:21:22.173
BEEN. OF CONCERN FOR A WHILE I

02:21:22.240 --> 02:21:24.175
KNOW I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IN

COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT THAT'S

02:21:34.752 --> 02:21:35.987
PROBABLY THE BEST ROUTE THAT'S

02:21:36.054 --> 02:21:37.522
THE LEAST EXPENSIVE ROUTE IT

02:21:37.589 --> 02:21:39.457
USUALLY WERE CLOSEST TO THE TO

02:21:39.524 --> 02:21:40.358
THE INDIVIDUAL THAT WANTS TO

02:21:40.425 --> 02:21:42.093
GET AN EDUCATION AND IF IT

02:21:42.160 --> 02:21:43.528
WORKS FOR THEIR DAILY LIFE.

02:21:43.595 --> 02:21:45.029
THAT IS GOOD BUT IN OFTENTIMES

02:21:45.096 --> 02:21:51.035
THAT ISN'T THE CASE WG WAS. WAS

02:21:51.102 --> 02:21:51.636

HOSPITALS THAT THEY WOULD LIKE

02:22:04.949 --> 02:22:05.416
ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH THE

02:22:05.483 --> 02:22:05.917
HOSPITAL SYSTEMS BECAUSE

02:22:05.984 --> 02:22:07.652
THEY'VE WORKED THERE. AND THE

02:22:07.719 --> 02:22:11.356
ISSUE IS WE CAN'T GET. APPROVAL

AS TEN STUDENTS. AND THESE ARE

02:22:28.406 --> 02:22:28.940
REAL PEOPLE THESE ARE PEOPLE

THAT THE HOSPITALS THEMSELVES

02:22:30.241 --> 02:22:31.776
HAVE IDENTIFIED THAT WOULD

02:22:31.843 --> 02:22:32.977

ASSERTION THAT CALIFORNIA'S

02:24:10.508 --> 02:24:12.410
BUSINESS WHY NURSING SHORTAGE

WHICH IS BASED ON ALAR STUDY.

02:24:14.912 --> 02:24:17.882

NUMBERS WERE IN TO BE

02:24:22.353 --> 02:24:25.323
IMPOSSIBLE. STEAD AS LEARNED

02:24:25.390 --> 02:24:26.290
HERE TODAY THERE ARE REGIONAL

02:24:26.357 --> 02:24:27.125
POCKETS WHERE AB SHORTAGES BUT

02:24:27.191 --> 02:24:27.692
THE AREAS WHERE THE LARGEST

02:24:27.759 --> 02:24:29.227
PRIVATE NURSING PROGRAMS ARE

02:24:29.293 --> 02:24:31.462
CONCENTRATED ARE ACTUALLY AREAS

02:24:31.529 --> 02:24:33.264
OF SURPLUS. SO IN ROAMING

02:24:33.331 --> 02:24:34.599
GROWTH IN THOSE AREAS AS A

02:24:34.665 --> 02:24:36.067
DIRECT IMPACT ON WHETHER

CORPORATIONS OR CORPORATE

02:24:45.977 --> 02:24:48.846
ENTITIES. AND ACTUALLY

HOSPITALS ARE ACTUALLY CONTROL

02:24:50.982 --> 02:24:52.016
AND SET THE NUMBER OF CLINICAL

02:24:52.083 --> 02:24:54.752

02:24:54.819 --> 02:24:56.020
COMMUNITY COLLEGE NURSING

02:24:56.087 --> 02:24:58.356

02:24:58.423 --> 02:24:59.957
FROM CLINICAL SITES BY

02:25:00.024 --> 02:25:01.059
HOSPITALS SO THAT RAPIDLY

02:25:01.125 --> 02:25:02.760
EXPANDING PROPERTY PROGRAMS

02:25:02.827 --> 02:25:03.594
COULD YOU THOSE SITES FOR THEIR

02:25:03.661 --> 02:25:06.831
STUDENTS. FACT 27% A PRIVATE

02:25:06.898 --> 02:25:09.600
INCORRECT STATE. ARE FROM ONE

02:25:09.667 --> 02:25:12.303
PRIVATE SCHOOL. LET ME BE CLEAR

02:25:12.370 --> 02:25:12.904
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT THE HARD

02:25:12.970 --> 02:25:14.138
WORK NURSING STUDENTS HERE

02:25:14.205 --> 02:25:16.474
TODAY WE ARE NOT TRYING TO GET

02:25:16.541 --> 02:25:17.708
RID OF PRIVATE NURSING PROGRAMS

02:25:17.775 --> 02:25:20.478
AS AN ALTERNATIVE. BUT SEE IN

02:25:20.545 --> 02:25:22.480
THE CNA BELIEVES IN THE NEED TO

02:25:22.547 --> 02:25:25.116
SUPPORT MORE AFFORDABLE PUBLIC

02:25:25.183 --> 02:25:26.951
EDUCATION RATHER THAN PUSHING

02:25:27.018 --> 02:25:28.686
AN ALTERNATIVE THAT CAN COST

02:25:28.753 --> 02:25:30.888
NEARLY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

02:25:30.955 --> 02:25:31.422
THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND PUT

02:25:31.489 --> 02:25:33.391
STUDENTS IN SUBSTANTIAL DEBT.

02:25:33.458 --> 02:25:34.926
WE WOULD LIKE TO ALSO NOTE THAT

02:25:34.992 --> 02:25:36.260
PUBLIC SCHOOLS DO NOT HAVE THE

02:25:36.327 --> 02:25:38.696
FUNDS THAT PRIVATE SCHOOLS HAVE

02:25:38.763 --> 02:25:41.232
TO CLOSE SOME OF THESE GAPS IN

02:25:41.299 --> 02:25:42.834
CERTAIN AREAS WHERE THERE ARE

02:25:42.900 --> 02:25:44.769
GAPS. WE NEED TO MAKE PUBLIC

02:25:44.836 --> 02:25:46.838
POLICY TO SUPPORT PUBLIC

02:25:46.904 --> 02:25:49.474
SCHOOLS. AS A PRIORITY.

02:25:49.540 --> 02:25:50.508
STUDENTS ENROLLED IN PUBLIC

02:25:50.575 --> 02:25:51.609
NURSING PROGRAMS ARE MORE

02:25:51.676 --> 02:25:54.078
DIVERSE. MORE OFTEN THE FIRST
