DONE THAT YET RIGHT SO- ANY ANY WHAT EVERYBODY HAVE ANY ISSUES- ONE POINTED FROM THE CONSENT CALENDAR. OKAY IS THERE A MOTION ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR. RIGHT CENTER LEYVA IS MOVED. AT THE CONSENT CALENDAR CONSOLE WOULD CALL THE ROLL. ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR GLAZER AYE GLAZER HI NIELSEN RIGHT NIELSEN HI. HERTZBERG LEYVA FIVE LEYVA FIVE NEWMAN. LEADVILLE THE ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR HAS THREE VOTE TO LEAVE IT OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS OKAY SO I'M GONNA TURN THE GAVEL OVER TO MY VICE YEARS CENTERED NIELSEN FOR PRESENTATION ON- 1439% PLEASE SEE THEY'RE NOT. AB TERRIFIC THANK YOU ARE COMMITTEE MEMBERS SB FOURTEEN THIRTY NINE WOULD ENSURE THE PAY TO PLAY PROVISION THAT APPLIES TO STATE AGENCY APPOINTEES OR APPOINTED LOCAL OFFICIALS WHEN APPROVING A LICENSE PERMIT OR ENTITLEMENT FOR USE ALSO APPLY TO LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS WHEN ACTING IN IDENTICAL CAPACITY. THE LEVINE ACT PROHIBITS AN OFFICER OF AN AGENCY FROM ACCEPTING SOLICITING OR DIRECTING A CONTRIBUTION OF MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS FROM ANY PARTY PARTICIPANT OR THEIR AGENTS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN THE OFFICER KNOWS OR HAS REASON TO KNOW THAT THE PARTICIPANT HAS FINANCIAL INTERESTS. THIS PROHIBITION IS IN EFFECT WHILE THE PROCEEDING INVOLVING A LICENSE PERMIT OR OTHER ENTITLEMENT FOR USE IS PENDING AND FOR THREE MONTHS FOLLOWING THE DATE OF FINAL DECISION IS RENDERED THIS PROHIBITION APPLIES TO STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES COMPRISED OF APPOINTED OFFICIALS WHO MIGHT BE RUNNING FOR OFFICE HOWEVER UNDER CURRENT LAW LOCAL AGENCIES WHOSE MEMBERS ARE DIRECTLY ELECTED BY VOTERS AND WHO MAY BE RUNNING FOR RE ELECTION ARE NOT INCLUDED. IN THIS PROHIBITION. CURRENT STATE LAW COUNTER INTUITIVELY PERMITS LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS RUNNING FOR REELECTION. TO SOLICIT AND ACCEPT SIZEABLE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THOSE WHO ARE SEEKING PERMITS OR LICENSES. FOR THEM. BUT PROHIBITS IDENTICAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO AN APPOINTED OFFICIAL RUNNING FOR OFFICE WHO'S AT ACTED IN EXACTLY THE SAME CAPACITY. THE PROBLEM IS SPECIAL INTERESTS SEEKING TO INFLUENCE LOCAL DECISION MAKING HIS LONG STANDING AND WELL DOCUMENTED AND VERY REAL. FOR EXAMPLE RECENT REPORTS SHOW THAT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY. MORE THAN 30% OF THE ROUGHLY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS TO CURRENT HUNTINGTON PARK CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS. CAME FROM EIGHT COMPANIES AND THEIR EXECUTIVES WITH PENDING REQUESTS FOR CONTRACTS WITHIN THAT CITY. SB FOURTEEN THIRTY NINE EXTENDS THIS PROHIBITION TO LOCAL OFFICIALS. NOW THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES AN ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE PRIOR TO A PROCEEDING BY A PARTY. THE BILL ALSO EXPANDS THE CONTRIBUTION PROHIBITION TO INCLUDE SPOUSES WHEN THE CONTRIBUTION COMES FROM A BANK ACCOUNT SHARED WITH THE PERSON. WHO IS AN APPLICANT IN THE PRECEDING. FINALLY THIS BILL EXPANDS THE TIME FRAME PROHIBITING SPECIFIC CONTRIBUTIONS. FOLLOWING AN OFFICIALS ACTIONS FROM THREE MONTHS TO TWELVE MONTHS. CALIFORNIANS DESERVE TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THEIR LOCAL OFFICIALS. AND CLOSING THIS PAY TO PLAY LIEU PAUL WOULD PROVIDE THE APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTABILITY. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB FOURTEEN THIRTY NINE. WITH ME THIS MORNING IS JONATHAN MATUS DYING WITH THE COP CALIFORNIA COMMON CAUSE TO PRESENT HIS TESTIMONY IS WHAT MISTER CHAIR. FOR ME TO START PLEASE COME FORWARD AND GIVE US YOUR TESTIMONY. GOOD MORNING JOHNSON AT THE SIGNING EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA COMMON CAUSE. WE ARE PROUD TO BE THE LEAD ORGANIZATION IN SUPPORT OF SB FOURTEEN THIRTY NINE THE COMMONSENSE REFORM THAT WOULD CLOSE A PAY TO PLAY WILL PULL IN THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT. WE THANK THE CHAIR FOR AUTHORING THE BILL AND THINK COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH THIS ON IT SUBSTANCE. I CENTER GLAZER NOTED% THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT CURRENTLY LIMITS THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF PARTY SEEKING A CONTRACT PERMIT OR LICENSE FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN GIVE TO APPOINTED MEMBERS. OF LOCAL BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS BUT DOES NOT SIMPLY LIMIT THE SAME CONTRIBUTIONS TO CITY COUNCILS AND COUNTY BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS. THIS CREATES BIZARRE OUTCOMES. AN APPOINTEE OF A PLANNING COMMISSION THAT MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS TO ACITY COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS WHO HAPPENS TO BE RUNNING FOR CITY COUNCIL. WILL BE PROHIBITED UNDER CURRENT LAW FROM ACCEPTING MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS FROM A DEVELOPER WITH BUSINESS BEFORE THAT PLANNING COMMISSION. BUT WHEN THE VERY SAME PROJECT AND THE VERY SAME DEVELOPER GO BEFORE CITY COUNCIL FOR A VOTE. THE CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THAT LIMITATION AND CAN TAKE WELL OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS FROM THE DEVELOPER. THERE ARE COUNTLESS EXAMPLES OF THIS SORT OF BEHAVIOUR HAPPENING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL OF CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE TENS OF THOUSANDS AND IN SOME INSTANCES OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. UNDER SB FOURTEEN THIRTY NINE A PERSON SEEKING A CONTRACT PERMIT OR LICENSE OR THEIR AGENT OR THEIR SPOUSE. WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GIVE A CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS. TO APPOINTED OR ELECTED LOCAL OFFICIAL WHILE THE CONTRACT PERMIT OR LICENSE IS PENDING AND FOR TWELVE MONTHS AFTERWARDS. REFORMS OF THIS KIND ARE COMMON AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. THE FEDERAL LAW PROHIBITS FEDERAL CONTRACTORS FROM DONATING TO FEDERAL CANDIDATES. AT LEAST FIFTEEN OTHER STATES LIMIT OR PROHIBIT CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS FOR SUMMER ALL STATE CONTRACTORS OR LICENSEES. AND EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA CITIES THE CALIFORNIA COMMON CAUSE COULD FIND. LIMIT OR PROHIBIT CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS FROM DEVELOPERS AND OR CITY CONTRACTORS. WITH BUSINESS BEFORE THE CITY. AS FOURTEEN THIRTEEN IS A SIN BUT MEANINGFUL STEPS TO ADDRESS SPECIAL INTEREST MONEY AND INFLUENCE IT CAN BUY INTO LOCAL POLITICS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SIR. DO WE HAVE ANYONE ELSE HERE PRESENT WISHING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE MODERATOR CAN WE GO TO THE LINES FOR ANYONE CALLING IN AND SUPPORT.

DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OF OUR MEMBERS HERE. UNDER WOLF THE US RESTAURANT I HAVE A QUESTION I JUST WANNA SAY I REALLY LOVE THIS BILL AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD- AND A QUESTION ABOUT WOULD LOCAL CITY COUNCILS IF THIS BILL WERE TO BE SIGNED INTO LAW WOULD THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHANGE CONTRIBUTION LEVELS ON THEIR OWN AT THE CITY COUNCIL OR WITH THIS OVER RIGHT THAT. THROUGH THE CHAIR THAT THIS DOESN'T CHANGE ANY- LOCAL. CONTRIBUTION LIMIT JUST ESTABLISHES AN AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE UNDER THIS BILL FOR- FOR. CLOSURE AND DISQUALIFICATION OKAY THANKS VERY MUCH THANK YOU CENTER THE EVA. AND THERE WOULD BE NO OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. SENATOR GLAZERS WOULD YOU LIKE TO TWELVE THANK YOU AT MISTER CHAIR AT I- YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL- WE ALL HAVE LIFE EXPERIENCES WHEN WE COME HERE HAS THE LEGISLATURE AND ONE OF MINE WAS BEING ON THE CITY COUNCIL AND BEING THE APPOINTED RAP TO OUR SOLID WASTE AUTHORITY. AND IT WAS AT THAT POINT IN TIME THAT I LEARNED THIS CURIOUS QUIRK IN OUR CODE THAT SAID THAT- AS AN APPOINTEE OF THE SOLID WASTE TORTILLA COULD NOT RECEIVE A CONTRIBUTION OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS BUT AS AN ELECTED LEADER THAT WAS NEVER A PROHIBITION THEY STOP TO ME. AND IT WAS THERE THAT I LEARNED OF THIS- QUIRKINESS AND APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY NOW AS A SENATOR TO COME AND TRY TO CLEAR IT UP AND AT AT THE AT. AT THE HEART OF IT IS CREATING TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN THE DECISIONS THAT ALL OF OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS MAKE AND I THINK THIS BILL ADVANCES THAT WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. IT FIRST AND CONFIDENCE. AND NOW MOVES THE BILL AND HUNDRED HAS MOVED TO BILL. WE WILL PROCEED THEN. THE ROLL CALL VOTE. FOR SB FOURTEEN THIRTY NINE GLAZER THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS GLAZER HI GLAZER HI NIELSEN HI NIELSEN FIVE HERTZBERG. LEYVA AYE LEYVA HI NEWMAN.

THIRTEEN SIXTY FILE ITEM NUMBER TWO SENATOR UMBERG PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY PODIUM THERE BUT WILL MAKE A SPECIAL ACCOMMODATIONS FROM YOU THAT YOU CAN DO IT FROM RIGHT THERE IF YOU'D LIKE A LOT I DON'T WANT ANY SPECIAL ACCOMMODATIONS. I WOULDN'T WANT YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS- WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR SPONSOR COMMITTEE CONSULTANT SCOTT MATSUMOTO- IN THE STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK THE BILL TO WORK ON THIS BILL I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE RECOMMENDED CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS. WITHOUT OBJECTION. ALL RIGHT- TODAY I'M PRESENTING S. B. THIRTEEN SIXTY THE DISCLOSURE CLARITY ACT THIS BILL WOULD IMPROVE ELECTION TRANSPARENCY BY UPDATING CAMPAIGN ADVERTISING DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. MAKE TV AND ONLINE GRAPHIC AD DISCLOSURES. EASY TO READ LEGISLATURE HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES WITH THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN CALIFORNIA DISCLOSURE ACT IN THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN PETITION DISCLOSURE ACT. THIS BILL BUILDS ON THAT WORK S. B. THIRTEEN SIXTY ADDRESSES AND FIXES THE THREE MOST. USED TACTICS. MAY BE ABUSED TACTICS BY SOME CAMPAIGN COMMITTEES TO AVOID TRANSPARENCY THAT'S REQUIRED BY CALIFORNIA LAW. IT WOULD REQUIRE ONLINE IMAGE ADVERTISEMENT DISPLAY THEIR DISCLOSURES ON THE SOLID WHITE. OR BLACK BACKGROUND TO MAKE THEM EASY TO READ AS CURRENTLY REQUIRED FOR TELEVISION VIDEO PRINT THAT. IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE ONLINE IMAGES THAT ARE LARGE ENOUGH TO SHOW THE NAME OF THE COMMITTEE PAYING FOR THE- THE STOP FUNDER. FINALLY S. B. THIRTEEN SIXTY WOULD REQUIRE TELEVISION VIDEO ADVERTISEMENTS TO DISPLAY THE TOP THREE FUNDERS OF THE COMMITTEE IN YELLOW. AND SEPARATED BY HALF A BLANK LINE DISTINGUISH THEM FROM THE NAME OF THE COMMITTEE. IT WILL ALSO ENSURE VOTERS BEING ASKED TO SIGN THIS REFERENDUM RECALL PETITION. THE DON'T LIST IF THEY DON'T LIST THE TOP FUNDERS ON THE PETITION- THEN IT WOULD AN INSTRUCTION AT EACH SIGNATURE BOX NOT TO SIGN UNLESS THEY'VE BEEN SHOWN THE SHEET. THAT TRANSPARENCY IS CRITICAL FOR OUR- POLITICAL PROCESS TO. SURVIVE I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUED ENGAGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS- THERE TO WITNESSES- I BELIEVE MR MARC POWERS IS WITNESS NUMBER ONE WAS ON THE PHONE. TRAFFIC THANK YOU CENTER ON BIRD WE WILL GO TO YOUR WITNESS IS NOW AND YOU ARE HERE FOR THE EARLIER PRESENTATION BUT WE SAID TWENTY MINUTES ASIDE FOR EACH SIDE IN. TWO MINUTES FOR EACH OF THE TWO POTENTIAL WITNESSES SO HI MISTER POWERS- WE WERE RIDLEY READY TO HEAR YOUR TESTIMONY NOW. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. I JUST MARK POWERS FROM THE CALIFORNIA BROADCASTERSASSOCIATION REPRESENTING THE RADIO AND TELEVISION STATIONS SERVING YOUR DISTRICT AUDIENCES WE'VE WORKED MANY YEARS WITH TRENTON IS ORGANIZATION TO ENSURE POLITICAL AD DISCLOSURES ACROSS MEDIA PLATFORMS ARE FIRST OF ALL SIMPLE AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND. THAT THIS CLOSER SORIA DISCLOSURES ARE SHORT AS POSSIBLE AND EASY FOR THE AUDIENCE TO HEAR OR READ WE BELIEVE THAT DISCLOSURE CHANGES PROPOSED FOR TV ADS IN THIS BILL ARE REASONABLE AND ALLOW VOTERS TO QUICKLY AND EASILY READ THE TOP FUNDERS WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY COMPLAINTS OVER THE YEARS ABOUT IT BEING DIFFICULT FOR TV ADVERTISERS TO COMPLY WITH THE TEXT DISCLOSE ACT. CURRENT CHECKLIST OF REQUIREMENTS SUCH A SOLID BACKGROUND FONTS SIZES AND COLORS SO OTHER MEDIA ADVERTISERS SHOULD NOT HAVE DIFFICULTIES FOLLOWING EQUALLY SPECIFIC AND CLEAR RULES SECONDLY WE'VE COME TO CONCLUSION DISCLOSURE SHOULD ALWAYS BE FAIR AND CONSISTENT THE VOTERS CAN EXPECT TO SEE THE SAME INFORMATION ACROSS ALL MEDIA PLATFORMS UNLESS THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGICAL ISSUE WITH DOING SO FOR EXAMPLE RADIO CANNOT CURRENTLY DISPLAYED IT CONSISTSOF THE DISCLOSURES. SO IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE DISCLOSURE ITSELF DOES NOT PROVIDE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE FOR ONE MEDIUM OVER ANOTHER SB THIRTEEN SIXTY WOULD NARROW THIS GAP IN MANDATORY DISCLOSURES BETWEEN BROADCASTERS NEWSPAPERS AND ONLINE ADS THAT PRECEDE THE TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER POWERS WILL GO TO YOUR NEXT WITNESS MISTER TRENT LANG FROM THE CALIFORNIA CLEAN MONEY CAMPAIGN MISTER LANG PLEASE PROCEED.

I THANK YOU VERY MUCH EXCEPT IT DOESN'T INCLUDE CHANGES TO THE TOP. CONTRIBUTOR THRESHOLD- AND MESSAGES. THAT THE GENERATED OFF THIRTEEN SIXTY THAT FOCUS ON OFFLINE. ADS ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONLY MAJOR TYPE OF POLITICAL AD RIGHT NOW. THAT CURRENTLY DOES NOT REQUIRE A BALLOT MEASURE AND VALUE COMMITTEES. TO LIST AT LEAST ONE TOP FUNDER. IF THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION OF THE UNIT WAS SWAPPED FOR LITERALLY MONTHS. BY A WITH ONLINE ADS THAT HIT WHO WAS PAYING FOR THEM. THE NEW RULES PROVIDE ARE VERY SIMILAR TO THE RULES FOR TV OF- AND PRINT ADS HAVE BEEN IN PLACE SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SUCH AS CLEARED SPECIFIC RULES FOR- THE DISCLOSURES POSITION BACKGROUND COLOR FONT TYPES.

AT THE CENTER NIELSEN MISTER CHAIRMAN IBM I WILL OPPOSE THE BILL. THERE'S A LONG LINE OF ATTEMPTS I BELIEVE TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT PARTICULARLY FOUR RECALL PETITIONS AND FOR. DIRECT DEMOCRACY. I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY BUT I DON'T SUPPORT IT THIS IS NOT MAY BE OF MAJOR CONSEQUENCE BUT IT'S- CHIPPING AWAY AT. AND I'VE TAKEN THE POSITION OF EVEN OPPOSING THAT CHECKED THE CHIPPING AWAY AT THIS TIME I THINK IT IS INDEED AN INTENTIONAL ATTEMPT AT LEAST IN PART. TO DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM SUPPORTING RECALLS AND DIRECT DEMOCRACY THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR NIELSEN CENTER I'M BERG- IT'S TO CLARIFICATION ON THIS FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR THRESHOLD FOR TOP CONTRIBUTORS. PENSION YOU'RE TAKING AMENDMENTS MAYBE YOU COULD MAKE THAT CLEAR TO THE COMMITTEE IN TERMS OF WHAT YOUR INTENTIONS ARE THERE. WELL WE ARE CONTINUE TO NEGOTIATE WITH STAKEHOLDERS- WITH RESPECT TO FOR EXAMPLE VERY SMALL COMMITTEES COMMITTEES UNDER FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE REQUIREMENTS THATMAY APPLY TO THEM- BUT AT THIS TIME. OF THE REQUIREMENTS CONTINUE FOR ALL FOR ALL THOSE WHO ARE EITHER POSTING OR AIRING IN OTHER WORDS IT AT YOUR BILL DOESN'T CHANGE THAT IN YOUR VIEW YOUR BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THAT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR REQUIREMENT FOR DISCLOSURE THAT'S THAT'S CORRECT. OKAY VERY GOOD. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS SENATOR NEWMAN. THANK YOU MR SENT OVER A GOOD GLAD TO SUPPORT THE BILL LIKE I DO HAVE LET ME SAY FIRST DOING IT CREATE WHAT. MISTER LANG AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN DOING THAT FOR SOME TIME- I SOMETIMES WORRY WERE PLAYING A BIT OF A GAME OF WHACK A MOLE. WHEN IT COMES TO. IT YOU KNOW HOW SPECIAL AT THE- THE IN THE INTERPRETER PERSONAL REALM- YOU KNOW HOW SIGNATURE GATHERS INTERACTING WITH A CONSTRUCTION SITE I WILL PULL RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE- CENTER NIELSEN ABOUT NINE I BUT I DON'T THINK THIS PROJECT MARKS YET THINGS PROBLEM WITH THE MECHANICS THAT ESPECIALLY IN THE WAY THAT YOU HAVE DIFFERENT. GROUPS HAVE WEAPONIZED DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE PROCESS SO MY I DO HAVE A QUESTION THOSE WHO SHOWED ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S AND YOU KNOW I WAS FIND PUZZLING IS THE NAMES OF GROUPS HOW HOW HAVE YOU RETHOUGHT THIS DON'T THINK TO STRESS DIRECTLY- BUT EVEN TO THE EXTENT THAT WE REQUIRE YOU KNOW THE NAMING- AS PROMISED POSSIBLE THE GROUP SUPPORTS ON HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW THE CONFUSING NAME- PROBLEM BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S A FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUE OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN NAME ANYTHING ANYTHING BUT- MY CONCERN IS THAT THE AVERAGE VOTER- ONLY LOOK SO DEEP- ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE INTERACTING WITH. A PAGE SIX YOU GOT IT LET ME LET ME RESPOND AS YOU MISTER LANG IS I RESPOND AS WELL NUMBER ONE IS IT I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THAT WHATEVER WE DO SOME INGENIOUS FOLKS. AT LEAST ATTEMPT TO FIND A WAY AROUND WHATEVER DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS WE PROVIDE- THE ESSENCE OF THIS THOUGH IS IF YOU NAME THE COMMITTEE YOU KNOW- MOTHERS FOR EQUALITY AND JUSTICE- BUT IT'S FUNDED BY X. Y. Z. ENTITY IS IT THE X. Y. Z. ENTITY THE FUNDER THAT'S WHAT'S IT IS ESSENTIAL BE DISCLOSED AS OPPOSED TO THE COMMITTEE NAY AND YOU COULD CREATE A COMMITTEE NAME THAT. YOU KNOW MOTHERS FOR EQUALITY JUSTICE OF SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ETCETERA ETCETERA JUST TO. READ NAMES SO LONG THAT IT BASICALLY- IT IT ELIMINATES THE PURPOSE OR UNDERMINES THE PURPOSE OF THE- OF THE DISCLOSURE BLANK SEEMS ANGST ALSO WANNA RESPOND. AT HE SAID EXACTLY THE RIGHT THING ABOUT THAT I'LL JUST ADD THAT THE CRUCIAL PART BEING THOSE TOP THREE FUNDERS AND FOR INITIATIVE PETITIONS MAKE SURE THAT VOTERS SEE THAT TOP UNDER SHEETS OF A SEA OF THEM. EXISTING LAW. DOES HAVE YOUR MARKING RULES FOR ABOUT WHAT MEASURE SO THE IF SOMEBODY. USE MONEY TO US. IDENTIFY BALLOT MEASURE OR- I BELIEVE I BELIEVE WE CAMPAIGN I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE BUT DEFINITELY A BALLOT MEASURE. THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO UP ONE OF THOSE THREE FOR. ON THE CABIN THEY GAVE OVER FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND ONE OF ONE OF THE TOP THREE SO. THAT DOESN'T SOLVE THE FUNNY NAME ISSUE THE FIVE APRIL STILL BE THERE WE HAVE TO SHOW THOSE. BUT THE TOP THREE OF CONTRIBUTORS THAT THE REALLY IMPORTANT PART WE BELIEVE. THAT WOULD RESHAPE THAT AND YOU KNOW THEN AGAIN AGAIN. AS IT RELATES TO YOU TO IN PERSON COMMUNICATIONS WE WILL CONTINUE HAVE THIS PROBLEM WITH PAID SIGNATURE GATHERS FOR FISHING. ESPECIALLY PROFESSIONAL PITCHING TOGETHER. AT A DO APPRECIATE YOU KNOW YOU CAN SAY YOU KNOW THIS PETITION MAYBE CIRCLE YOU YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASK ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS. YOU JUST TRY JUST TRYING FOR YOU LOCAL STATER BROTHERS WITH WITH SPECIAL SECTION SIX AGO SO. THAT REMAINS AN ISSUE TO MY MIND THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE FASHION BUT BUT SUPPORT THIS BILL TO DEATH. ALL RIGHT SEEING NO FURTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE CENTER NUMBER WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE UP JUST BRIEFLY- ESTES AND THE NIELSEN I UNDERSTAND SO NEILSON'S CONCERNS. THIS DOES NOT UNDERMINE THIS DOES NOT CREATE A HIGHER BAR FOR EXAMPLE FOR RECALL OR ANYTHING ELSE IT JUST REQUIRES. ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE ACTUALLY EVEN MORE ACCURATELY MORE PRECISE DISCLOSURE MORE USEFUL DISCLOSURE. AND I URGE A NO VOTE THANK YOU MR APOLOGIZE FOR MY TARDINESS I WOULD AND I.

WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE THIS IS FILE ITEM NUMBER THREE SB NINE TWENTY ONE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD MORNING AND MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS- BEFORE I BEGIN LET ME FIRST THANK COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS. AND NOTE THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF MENDING THIS BILL TO ADDRESS THE CHANGES SUGGESTED IN THE ANALYSIS. SHOOTING SPECIFICALLY STRIKINGLY ORIGINAL PROVISION WITH LANGUAGE THAT STATES THAT THE ONLINE PLATFORMS MUST SUBMIT. ANY OTHER INFORMATION SPECIFIED BY THE COMMITTEE IN REGULATION. WILL BE STRIKING THAT LANGUAGE THAT HAVING SAID THAT I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT SENATE BILL NINE TWENTY ONE THE DIGITAL ADVERTISING TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OR DATA ACT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER USED AN ACRONYM WITH THE BILL. VERY PROUD OF IT WHICH WILL CREATE A PUBLIC PUBLICLY MANAGED VISUAL ADVERTISEMENT REPOSITORY. TO BETTER AND MORE TRANSPARENTLY PROVIDE ACCESS TO IN OVERSIGHT OF DIGITAL POLITICAL ADS AS YOU KNOW DIGITAL ADVERTISEMENTS HAVE COME TO SERVICE POWERFUL TOOLS FOR POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS. THE EPHEMERAL NATURE OF THESE ADS WHOEVER MAKESIT MAKES LOCATING THEM AND ADDRESSING AND CORRECTING FALSE STATEMENTS A TREMENDOUS CHALLENGE FOR THE MEDIA RESEARCHERS GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WATCHDOG GROUPS. NOT TO MENTION THE VOTING PUBLIC IT'S HARD TO OVERSTATE THE DEGREE TO WHICH POLITICAL ADVERTISING HAS EXPLODED IN RECENT YEARS. IN THE TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN ELECTION CYCLE FOR EXAMPLE DIGITAL MEDIA ACCOUNTED FOR ONLY SPENDING. BY TWENTY TWENTY THIS FIGURE HAD EXPANDED MORE THAN SPENDING AND RUN NUMBER TERMS COMPARED TO THE ROUGHLY SEVENTY EIGHT SEVEN HUNDRED TO EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION SPEND NATIONAL CAMPAIGNS. OVERALL IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ELECTION CYCLE BY TWENTY TWENTY MORE THAN ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS WAS BEING SPENT ON DIGITAL ADS ALONE. IN THE FACE OF THESE MONUMENTAL CHANGES REGULATORS SUCH AS THE FAIR POLITICAL PRACTICES COMMISSION AS WELL AS OTHER ORGANIZATIONS WHICH STRIVE PROVIDE VOTERS WITH TRUTHFUL AND TIMELY INFORMATION SUCH AS WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONTENT. IN THE PAYMENTS ASSOCIATE WITH THE ODDS OFTEN FACE DAUNTING CHALLENGES IN POLICING DIGITAL CAMPAIGN ADVERTISEMENTS DUE TO BOTH THEIR TRANSITORY NATURE AS WELL AS CAMPAIGNS ABILITY TO PERSONALIZE. MESSAGES AND TARGET SPECIFIC AUDIENCES. BECAUSE THE DISCLAIMERS REQUIRED FOR DISABILITY- ADVERTISEMENTS HAVE GENERALLY BEEN MODELED AFTER THOSE REQUIRED FOR PRINT OR TELEVISION TOOLS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR LOCATING IN REVIEWING. DIGITAL POLITICAL ADS ARE GENERALLY LACKING IN FAILED TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT LEVELS OF TRANSPARENCY. THIS IS CREATED REGULATORY GAPS AS NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE DEVELOPED AND DEPLOYED SUCH AS REPLICATING ADS WITH SMALL BUT DELIBERATE CHANGES FOR MICRO TARGETING TO SPECIFIC AUDIENCES. THE USE OF GIFS AND MEMES BY CAMPAIGNS ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS SUCH AS FACEBOOK INSTAGRAM AND TICTOC. AS WELL AS FOR CONTENT IN PEER TO PEER TEXTING PROGRAMS DEPLOYED BY POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS WHILE SOME ONLINE PLATFORMS RETAIN TO MAKE AVAILABLE SOME INFORMATION ABOUT POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENTS ON THE RESPECTIVE PLATFORMS. THE CURRENT REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO POLITICAL ADVERTISING ON THESE PLATFORMS DOES NOT REQUIRE ALL DIGITAL ADS RUN ON THESE PLATFORMS TO HAVE TO HAVE ANY- CONSISTENT. FORMAT OR OR BASIS FOR REPORTING SB NINE TWENTY ONE TIGHTENS THE DEFINITION OF AN ONLINE PLATFORM TO ENCAPSULATE ALL OF THE VARIOUS DIGITAL AD SPACES THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING UTILIZED. TO EVEN INCLUDE CENTERS SUCH AS THAT UBER AND LIFT USE THEIR OWN MOBILE APPS TO DELIVER POLITICAL MESSAGING TO THEIR INSTALL USERS AS PART OF THE CAMPAIGN. TO ENCOURAGE A YES VOTE FORPROP TWENTY TWO DURING THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION CYCLE. THE DATA ACT WILL CREATE A PUBLIC REPOSITORY THAT WILL AFFORD VOTERS THE MEDIA RESEARCH IS THE F. PPC AND OTHER CAMPAIGN COMMITTEES AND CANDIDATES ACCESS TO EVERY DIGITAL POLITICAL AD. BY A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN OR COMMITTEE FOR AT LEAST FOUR YEARS UNDER THE BILL'S PROVISIONS ONLINE PLATFORMS THAT ALREADY COLLECT DATA. SUCH AS A DIGITAL COPY THE ADVERTISEMENT THE PROJECT NUMBER OF VIEWS- GENERATE THE ATTENTION AND THE NAME AND IDENTIFICATION NUMBER OF THE COMMITTEE THAT PAID FOR THE AD DOESN'T. WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT THIS INFORMATION TO THE AT THE PC ON A STANDARDIZED FIVE DAY CYCLE. THIS EASILY ACCESS FULLY INDEXED DIGITAL ADVERTISING ARCHIVE WILL APPLY ONLY TO STATE LEVEL BALLOT MEASURES AND STATE LEVEL CANDIDATES TO INCLUDE ELECTIONS FOR STATE ASSEMBLY. THE STATE SENATE CALPERS CASTERS AND ELECTION CAMPAIGNS FOR STATE CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS. AS CAMPAIGNS INCREASINGLY SHIFT TO INCORPORATE DIGITAL MODES OF COMMUNICATION ADVERTISING FACILITATING TRANSPARENCY AND CREATING ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS THAT ENSURE THAT VOTERS HAVE CLEAR VISIBILITY.

THE TASK FORCE'S MEMBERSHIP INCLUDED INDIVIDUALS IN ACADEMIA CLINICAL PRACTITIONERS AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM GOOD GOVERNMENT GROUPS AS WELL AS PLATFORM SB NINETY ONE WOULD CREATE A PUBLICLY SEARCHABLE CENTRALIZED LOCATION FOR DIGITAL CAMPAIGN ADS OR STATE LEVEL CANDIDATES AND BALLOT MEASURES ALLOWING THE PUBLIC TO ACCESS DIGITAL CAMPAIGN ADS THAT APPEAR ON VARIOUS ONLINE PLATFORMS. BECAUSE OF THE IMPERMANENT NATURE OF DIGITAL CAMPAIGN AS IT CAN BE DIFFICULT AND SOMETIMES IMPOSSIBLE FOR A VOTER TO TRACK DOWN AN AD BASED ONLINE PREVIOUSLY FIND OUT MORE ABOUT IT FUNDING OR REVIEW WITH MESSAGING OR TO FIND OTHER DIGITAL ADS ASSOCIATED WITH A PARTICULAR CAMPAIGN OR ELECTION UNDERSTANDING WHO AND WHAT INTERESTS ARE BEHIND DIGITAL CAMPAIGN AD HELP VOTERS WEIGH THE VALUE AND VERACITY OF THE ACT MESSAGE. THAT'S EMPOWERING THEM TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS AT THE BALLOT BOX THE ABILITY TO REVIEW ADS ALSO ENABLES THE PUBLIC TO HOLD POLITICAL COMMITTEES ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR MESSAGING SB NINETY ONE WOULD INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND ENABLE BETTER ACCOUNTABILITY I PROVIDING VOTERS WITH A CENTRAL LOCATION BE USED DIGITAL ADS ACROSS ALL ONLINE PLATFORMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CAMPAIGN OR ELECTION.

FIVE ALL RIGHT WELL WE HAVE EVERYONE HERE IS THAT RIGHT AND WHAT'S THE VOTE CONSULTANT FOUR FOUR ZERO OKAY THAT BILLS OUT FOUR ZERO WITH ONE MEMBER NONVOTING GRADUATIONS ON THAT SENATOR NEWMAN. THE OF THE SECOND BILL ON OUR AGENDA. SB ELEVEN THIRTY ONE YOU'RE READY I AM A SEAT ON THAT THANK YOU FOR THAT MISTER MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO NOW PRESENT SENATE BILL ELEVEN THIRTY ONE- BEFORE I BEGIN MY COMMENTS I WANT TO FIRST THANK COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS NOTE THAT I'M GOING TO CUT. THE SUGGESTED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WHICH NOW THE DEFINITION OF ELECTION WORKERS WHO MAY AND ROLE IN THE SAFE AT HOME PROGRAM- NOW TO FILL AS I'M SURE YOU WILL ALL AGREE FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS ARE HELD CORNERSTONE OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY IN RECENT YEARS HOWEVER AND ANY CREASING NUMBER. OF THE DILIGENT AND DEDICATED PUBLIC SERVANTS CHARGED WITH ADMINISTERING CALIFORNIA'S ELECTIONS HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO THREATS INTIMIDATION AND SOMETIMES PHYSICAL VIOLENCE AT POLLING PLACES IN THEIR OFFICES AND EVEN AT THEIR HOMES IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE TWENTY TWENTY GENERAL ELECTION IN UP TO THE PRESENT THE PHENOMENON OF VIOLENT THREATS THREATS AND HARASSMENT OF ELECTION WORKERS. CONTINUES TO CLIMB TO ALARMING LEVELS IN A TWENTY TWENTY ONE NATIONWIDE SURVEY AS MANY AS ONE IN THREE ELECTION WORKERS SAID THEY FELT THEY HAD FELT UNSAFE IN THE CONDUCT OF THEIR JOBS WITH A STUNNING ONE IN SIX INCLUDING THREATS TO THEIR LIVES AS A JOB RELATED CONCENS. SADLY THESE CONCERNS HAVE BEGUN TO AFFECT THE ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY STAFF AND ADMINISTER ELECTIONS HERE IN CALIFORNIA SINCE NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY MORE THAN 15% OF CALIFORNIA'S ELECTION OFFICIALS HAVE LEFT THEIR JOBS STUDENTS DIDN'T NO SMALL PART TO THE MARKED INCREASE IN AGGRESSIVE AND ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR DIRECTED. TOWARD TEM OTHER STATES HAVE ALREADY BEGUN ENACTING PROACTIVE MEASURES TO HOLD TO ACCOUNT THOSE WHO WOULD SEEK TO INTIMIDATE ELECTION WORKERS THROUGH THREATS OR ACTUAL VIOLENCE IT IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOW TAKE SIMILAR PROACTIVE STEPS IN ORDER TO HELP ELECTION WORKERS FEEL SAFE. AND SECURE SB ELEVEN THIRTY ONE WILL PROVIDE PROTECTION AND PEACE IN MIND PEACE OF MIND TO OUR ELECTION WORKERS BY EXTENDING THE OPTION OF THEIR ENROLLMENT IN ONE OR THE OTHER OF THE STATE'S TO EXISTING ADDRESS PROTECTION PROGRAMS. CALIFORNIA HAS A PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE CALLED SAFE AT HOME WHICH AFFORD PROTECTIONS TO SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND PEOPLE WHO WORK AT REAP REDUCTIVE CARE FOR. SB ELEVEN THIRTY ONE WOULD EXTEND ELIGIBILITY TO ENROLL IN STATE IN SAFE AT HOME. TO INVEST INDIVIDUALS WHO INTERACT WITH THE PUBLIC IN THE COURSE OF THEIR PERFORMANCE OF ELECTION RELATED WORK. UNDER THE TERMS OF SB ELEVEN THIRTY ONE THE MAILING ADDRESSES OF PEOPLE ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM WOULD BE SUBSTITUTED WITH A MAILING ADDRESS. PROVIDED BY THE SECRETARY STATE OR A LOCAL AGENCY SO THAT ELECTION WORKERS HOME ADDRESSES WILL NOT BE INCLUDED. IN PUBLIC RECORDS AND SUBSEQUENTLY PUBLICIZED EXPOSING THEM TO THREATS. AND INTIMIDATION SB ELEVEN THIRTY ONE WILL ALSO EXTEND PARITY TO ALL SAFE AT HOME PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS. BY APPLYING THE SAME HARASSMENT PROTECTIONS CURRENTLY AFFORDED TO ELECTION WORKERS UNDER THE BILL'S PROVISIONS TO REFER TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE WORKERS AS WELL. ALSO UNDER THE PROVISIONS INCLUDE ELEVEN THIRTY ONE ELECTION WORKERS WHO FEEL THAT THE PROVISIONS OF SAFE AT HOME. MAYBE TOO CUMBERSOME MAY CHOOSE TO BE ENROLLED IN THE SAME ADDRESS CONFIDENTIAL PROGRAM THAT IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO PEACE OFFICERS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. THE INCLUSION OF ELECTION WORKERS IN THIS PROGRAM WOULD ALLOW THESE WORKERS TO OBTAIN A SIMILAR LEVEL SIMILAR LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIAL VOTER STATUS. THEREBY ENABLING STATE LOCAL AGENCIES TO RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR PUBLIC RECORDS WITHOUT HAVING TO DISCLOSE THE PRIVATE ADDRESSES OF COVERED. ELECTION WORKERS SB ELEVEN THIRTY ONE WILL ALSO ELIMINATE THE CURRENT STATUTORY REQUIREMENT FOR PUBLICLY POSTING THE NAMES. OF POLL WORKERS AT POLLING PLACES THOUGH THE REQUIREMENT TO POST THE POLITICAL PARTY AFFILIATIONS OF POLL WORKERS ARE PULLING LOCATIONS. WOULD REMAIN IN PLACE THE BILL SPONSORS AND I HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH ELECTIONS OFFICIALS. TO ENSURE THAT SB ELEVEN THIRTY ONE FULFILLS THE NEEDS OF ELECTION WORKERS WHO FACE THESE THREATS. ON A REGULAR BASIS THIS LEGISLATION IS SADLY VERY MUCH NEEDED IN ORDER PROTECT THE CALIFORNIANS WHO DO THE LARGELY THANKLESS. BUT ESSENTIAL WORK OF ENSURING THAT OUR ELECTIONS ARE FAIR FREE AND EFFECTIVELY ADMINISTERED. HERE WITH ME TODAY ARE KIM EXAM KIM ALEXANDER FROM CALIFORNIA VOTER FOUNDATION. AND GALLERY RAMACHANDRAN FROM THE BRENNAN CENTER FOR JUSTICE AND I AM RESPECTFULLY ASKING FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THIS MORNING. THANK YOU SENATOR NEWMAN WE DO HAVE- TWO MINUTES SET ASIDE FOR EACH OF YOUR- OF THE- YOU HAVE IN ORDER. THAT YOU WANTED TO FOLLOW THEIR- I DO ACTUALLY I THINK KIM ALEXANDER WILKERSON'S ALEXANDER WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE WHAT WE WOULD LIKE YOUR TESTIMONY. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION I'M KIM ALEXANDER WITH THE CALIFORNIA VOTER FOUNDATION. AND AS NOTED IN THE BILL ANALYSIS WE RELEASED A REPORT LAST YEAR CALLED DOCUMENTING AND ADDRESSING HARASSMENT OF ELECTION OFFICIALS TO SHINE A LIGHT ON THREATS TO ELECTION OFFICIALS. AND THEIR STAFF ONE THING WE CAN DO TO ADDRESS THESE RISING THREATS IS TO EXTEND. ACCESS TO ADDRESS CONFIDENTIALITY PROGRAMS TO ELECTION ORKERS TO PROTECT THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION WELL CONTINUING TO WORK AND PUBLIC ELECTION ADMINISTRATION. LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIALS IN THE U. S. R. 80% FEMALE AND MANY OF THESE ATTACKS ARE GENDERED MISOGYNISTIC ATTACKS. THOSE ARE ON THE RECEIVING END OF THREATS ARE UNDERSTANDABLY RELUCTANT TO SPEAK OUT PUBLICLY ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE IN DURING BECAUSE DOING SO CAN TRIGGER EVEN MORE THREATS AND ATTACKS AND THEY ALSO. DO NOT WANT TO GIVE THEIR ATTACKERS THE SATISFACTION OF HAVING AN IMPACT. THERE IS GROWING CONCERN THAT IN THIS HOSTILE CLIMATE PEOPLE WILL NOT WANT TO TAKE THESE POSITIONS ALREADY 17% OF CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY COUNTY REGISTERS HAVE LEFT THEIR JOBS SINCE NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY. SOME CITING INCREASED AGGRESSIVE AND ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR TARGETED AT THEM. WHEN PEOPLE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WALKING TO THEIR CARS FROM THEIR OFFICES AT NIGHT WERE RELUCTANT TO WEAR ANY ARTICLE OF CLOTHING IN PUBLIC THAT IDENTIFIES THEM AS AN ELECTION WORKER OR LEAVING THEIR JOBS ALTOGETHER WHEN THEY ARE THREATENED WITH DEATH OR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS ARE NAMED. WHERE THEY HAVE TO KEEP A GO BAG BY THEIR DOOR IN CASE OUR HOME IS PICKETED WE MUST ACT. THE CALIFORNIA VOTER FOUNDATION HAS SUCCESSFULLY ADVANCED ELECTION SECURITY FOR OVER TWO DECADES IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION WHEN WE REALIZED. THE PHYSICAL SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE WHO RUN OUR ELECTIONS IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF ELECTION SECURITY TODAY. CALIFORNIA'S VOTING PROCESSES ALREADY AMONG THE MOST SECURE AND SECURE AND ACCESSIBLE IN THE COUNTRY SB ELEVEN THIRTY ONE WILL HELP ENSURE THE PEOPLE ENTRUSTED WITH ADMINISTERING OUR ELECTIONS ARE ALSO SECURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL GO TO YOUR SECOND WHEN HIS WIFE LEAVES AVAILABLE ON THE PHONE LINES- GALLERY RAMACHANDRAN- IF YOU'RE THERE WE WELCOME YOUR TESTIMONY NOW. THANK YOU GLAZER VICE CHAIR NELSON AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS GARY VAN CONVENT AND I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE BRENNAN CENTER FOR JUSTICE BRYAN SINGER COUNCIL ELECTIONS AND GOVERNMENT PROGRAM. IN THE SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE COMMISSIONED A SURVEY AND HELD INTERVIEWS WITH NEARLY THREE DOZEN ELECTION OFFICIALS AND OVER THIRTY ACTS BURKE. CULMINATING IN A REPORT WE PUBLISHED WITH THE BIPARTISAN POLICY CENTER. IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR WE COMMISSIONED AN ADDITIONAL NATIONAL SURVEY OF LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIALS. THROUGHOUT THIS RESEARCH THE OFFICIALS FOR AFFORDED ANONYMITY IF THEY WISH FREEING THEM TO SPEAK UP OPENLY. WHAT THEY TOLD US WAS HEARTBREAKING. LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIALS FEEL UNSAFE DUE TO HARASSMENT AND THREATS IN THE WAKE OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION. SEVERAL OF THE WORKERS WE INTERVIEWED REPORTED THAT THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS INCLUDING ELDERLY PARENTS AND CHILDREN WERE HARASSED OR THREATENED AND MULTIPLE OFFICIALS TOLD US THAT THEY WERE FORCEDTO FLEE THEIR HOMES. A RECENT SURVEY IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO FOUND THAT ONE IN FOR LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIALS STILL ARE CONCERNED ABOUT BEING ASSAULTED ON THE JOB. ONE SIX HAVE BEEN THREATENS THREE AND FIVE WORRY. THAT DRESS WILL MAKE RECRUITMENT DIFFICULT. MANY RUSSIANS EXPECT THAT THE DID NOT HAVE TIME OR- TO EVEN. OUT IF THEY ARE THEIR STAFF ARE ENTITLED TO ADDRESS CONFIDENTIALITY PROGRAMS STATE. ENSURING THE ELECTION WORKERS FEEL CONFIDENT APPLYING PRETTY PROTECTION. THE KIND OF MEASURE THAT PEOPLE OF ALL POLITICAL VIEWS CAN GET BEHIND. FOR INSTANCE OREGON RECENTLY PASSED A BILL WITH BROAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT THAT ALLOWS ELECTION WORKERS TO HAVE THEIR RESIDENTIAL ADDRESS MASK IN THE VOTER FILE. CALIFORNIA CAN BE A LEADER ON THIS FRONT. AS ASK B. ONE ONE THREE ONE WOULD ENSURE THAT ELECTION WORKER CAN CONFIDENTLY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FULL FACE AT HOME PROGRAM. WHICH NOT ONLY MATH PERSONAL INFORMATION IN THE VOTER FILE ALSO ALLOWS FOR THE USE OF A SUBSTITUTE ACT PASSED WITH MULTIPLE AGENCIES. ALTERNATELY THEY CA APPLY WITH THEIR LOCAL ELECTION ACCESS FOR VOTER FILE CONFIDENTIALITY. THAT'S AGAINST ELECTION WORKERS FOR DOING THEIR JOB RIGHT THAT BEGINS THE MCAFEE ITSELF AND THIS BILL. IS AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD IN PROTECTING THEM. GREAT THANK VERY MUCH I MISS RAMA. I WE'VE HEARD FROM TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF- ELEVEN THIRTY ONE WE'RE GOING TO GO FOR. THOSE WHO ARE STILL AT WANT TO TESTIFY TO GET THEIR NAME AND AFFILIATION INDICATION SUPPORT WILL START WITH IN ROOM TWENTY TWO HUNDRED. ANYONE HERE WISHING TO TESTIFY C. NUMBER GO TO THE PHONE LINES MODERATOR TO ASK ANYONE WHO WISH TO TESTIFY IN. FAVOR OF. SB ELEVEN THIRTY ONE TO SO INDICATE WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN FAVOR OF SB ELEVEN THIRTY ONE. PLEASE TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY A PRESS ONE- PLAYS THE ROLE AT THIS TIME. WHEN FILED BY ZERO. AND WE WILL BEGIN WITH LINE THIRTY TO PLEASE GO AHEAD.

MISTER CALDERON BODY ELSE'S QUEUED UP AT THIS TIME TERRIFIC WILL BRING THAT MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MEMBERS. CENTERED NIELSEN SENATOR NEWMAN WHAT YOU SHOULD EXPECT THAT THE PEOPLE IN SACRAMENTO ELECTIONS OFFICIALS AND THE ASSOCIATION OF CLERKS AND ELECTION OFFICIALS HAVE NOT TAKEN A POSITION HERE. THAT WOULD SEEM LIKE IF THERE'S SUCH A MANIFEST PROBLEM THAT THEY WOULD HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN ENGAGED IN THEY HAVEN'T BEEN THERE'S A REASON. I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S A REASON SENATOR ACCEPTED WITH THIS IS RELATIVELY EARLY IN THE PROCESS OF CAPITAL LETTERS. AND YOU SPEAK ENGLISH YEAH YES SENATOR NIELSEN I'M WE HAVE BEEN TALKING WITH CCO AND THEIR MEMBERS THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS THEY'VE ACTUALLY HELPED CRAFT THIS BILL AND GIVEN US THE SUGGESTION. TO REDACT POLL WORKERS NAMES FROM PUBLIC DISPLAY I'M SO THEY HAVE A LOT OF INPUT ON THE DELAWARE HOPING THAT THEY MAY WANT TO TAKE A SUPPORT POSITION BUT AS I MENTIONED IN MY TESTIMONY. A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING IMPACTED BY THESE THREATS ARE RELUCTANT TO SPEAK OUT PUBLICLY ABOUT THEM THERE WAS AN INCIDENT IN WASHINGTON STATE WHERE THEIR STATE ELECTION DIRECTOR DID. TESTIFY AND SHE WAS LATER HARASSED AND DOXXED ONLINE- FOLLOWING UP PUBLIC TESTIMONY SO WE HAVE THIS SITUATION WHERE I'M TALKING ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS. RIGHT I'M PERSONALLY SOMETIMES. RESULT IN EVEN MORE HARM BROUGHT TO THEM. WELL JUST TO CHEN OBSERVATION. NOT GOING TO TAKE A POSITION ON THE BILL BUT I WOULD ENCOURAGE THOSE WHO WERE SUPPORTING SUCH LEGISLATION. WOULD BE MORE ADAMANT AND BRINGING UP. THE BEST ELECTION INTEGRITY AND SECURITY. IS ACHIEVED BY LOCAL PRECINCT IN PERSON VOTING. AND THAT WE SHOULD BE ENCOURAGING THAT. RATHER THAN SO MUCH ABSENTEE VOTING IN THE DIRECT MAIL VOTING THAT PRECINCT VOTING SHOULD BE AT THE HIGHEST PRIORITY BECAUSE IT'S THE BEST SECURITY. YOUR NEIGHBORS KNOW YOU YOU KNOW YOUR NEIGHBORS THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER NIELSEN ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ARE CENTER LEFT. BUT I JUST HAVE TO RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE ABOUT- VOTING IN PERSON I THINK THAT'S THE IDEAL- I CHANGED TO PERMIT AFTER ABSENTEE VOTING WHEN I ALMOST MISSED MY OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE YEARS AGO WHEN WE WERE IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH- THE GROCERY STORES AND I COULDN'T GET BACK ALMOST COULDN'T GET BACK IN TIME TO VOTE. SO I THINK WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT VOTING IS ACCESSIBLE FOR EVERYONE AND UNLESS WE MAKE OUR ELECTION DAY A HOLIDAY SO EVERYONE HAS THE DAY OFF AND CAN GO VOTE I THINK THAT TO BE ABLE TO VOTE ABSENTEE IS VERY IMPORTANT. CENTER THANK YOU CENTER LIVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS SEE NINE CENTER NEWMAN IN A CLOSE M. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. SO THEY ARE ELECTIONS WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT OUR BAR FOR YOU KNOW WHETHER FOR CANDIDATES REFERENDA.
