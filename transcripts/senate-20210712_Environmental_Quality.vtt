MEMBER MURATSUCHI. I THINK

00:33:21.499 --> 00:33:23.368
SINCE WE ONLY PRODUCE 1% OF THE

00:33:23.434 --> 00:33:25.403
GREENHOUSE GASES THE GIFT THAT

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:27.105
CALIFORNIA CANGIVE TO PEOPLE

00:33:27.171 --> 00:33:29.240

ABSOLUTELY CLEAR AND IT SHOULD

00:34:29.434 --> 00:34:30.501
BE SENDING A CLEAR MARKET

00:34:30.568 --> 00:34:32.670
SIGNAL TO ANY OF THE INVESTORS

00:34:32.737 --> 00:34:36.474
THAT TO. THE- THE CALCHAMBER- I

00:34:36.541 --> 00:34:38.843
HAD REFERRED TO EARLIER- THAT

00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:41.479
WE WANT. TO INCENTIVIZE THE

00:34:41.546 --> 00:34:43.581
INNOVATION AND CARBON CAPTURE

00:34:43.648 --> 00:34:45.349
AND STORAGE WE WANT. THE

00:34:45.416 --> 00:34:46.751
INNOVATION AND THE CARBON

00:34:46.818 --> 00:34:49.554

BOARD TO COME UP WITH POLICIES

00:35:06.904 --> 00:35:10.041
AND STRATEGIES TO SUPPORT THESE

00:35:10.107 --> 00:35:12.743
TECHNOLOGIES. RIGHT I'M I KNOW

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:15.046
THAT MANY OF YOUR SUPPORTERS

00:35:15.112 --> 00:35:16.714
BECAUSE I'VE TALKED WITH THEM-

00:35:16.781 --> 00:35:18.616
WOULD CRINGE AT THE BIG

00:35:18.683 --> 00:35:20.685
KNOWLEDGE MAN OF INCINERATION

00:35:20.751 --> 00:35:23.187
OF OUR WASTE BUT NOW WE IN THE

00:35:23.254 --> 00:35:24.555
URBAN AREAS IN THE SUBURBAN

00:35:24.622 --> 00:35:26.023
AREAS LOVE TO LOAD UP OUR WAY

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:27.792
SINCE HAVE THE TEAMSTERS GET IN

00:35:27.859 --> 00:35:29.827
THEIR TRUCKS AND DRIVER THREE

00:35:29.894 --> 00:35:31.262
HUNDRED MILES AWAY. TO DISPOSE

00:35:31.329 --> 00:35:32.563
OF IT BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT IN

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:34.332
OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND WE KNOW

00:35:34.398 --> 00:35:35.633
THAT THE REST OF THE WORLD

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:37.735
INCINERATES AND DOES CARBON

00:35:37.802 --> 00:35:40.037
CAPTURE AND HAS A ZERO NET

00:35:40.104 --> 00:35:42.373
IMPACT IN ISN'T. RUNNING

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.976
RUINING OUR ROAD SERVICE-

00:35:45.042 --> 00:35:46.878
STRESSING OUT OUR ROADS WITH

00:35:46.944 --> 00:35:48.346
WITH LOADS AND LOADS OF OUR

00:35:48.412 --> 00:35:50.882
GARBAGE SO- I WOULD THINK IN

00:35:50.948 --> 00:35:51.983
THAT SPIRIT THAT THAT WOULD BE

00:35:52.049 --> 00:35:53.918
THE TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY THAT WE

00:35:53.985 --> 00:35:55.286
WOULD HOPE TO DEVELOP THAT ONE

00:35:55.353 --> 00:35:57.088
DAY WE ALL BREATHE EASIER

00:35:57.154 --> 00:36:00.091
ABOUT. USING TECHNOLOGY TO

00:36:00.157 --> 00:36:05.263
REDUCE OUR CARBON CAPTURE- I

00:36:05.329 --> 00:36:10.167
THINK THIS ENOUGH MISTER. OKAY

00:36:23.915 --> 00:36:27.852
NOW IN INSISTING ON. SOMETHING

00:36:27.919 --> 00:36:29.320
MORE THAN WHAT WE'VE GOT ON THE

00:36:29.387 --> 00:36:30.588
BOOKS RIGHT NOW WHEN IT COMES

00:36:30.655 --> 00:36:32.490
TO CLIMATE I THINK THAT RESTING

00:36:32.557 --> 00:36:34.392
ON OUR LAURELS THAT WHILE THE

00:36:34.458 --> 00:36:37.662
WHOLE STATES ON FIRE AND HEAT

00:36:37.728 --> 00:36:40.164
IS A HUNDRED TWENTY DEGREES IN.

00:36:40.231 --> 00:36:41.599
IF PEOPLE ARE LIVING NEAR

00:36:41.666 --> 00:36:43.668
FREEWAYS AND- YOU KNOW

00:36:43.734 --> 00:36:44.669
EXPECTING MOTHERS ARE HURTING

00:36:44.735 --> 00:36:47.471
AND- EVEN YOUR NEED TO. GO

00:36:47.538 --> 00:36:48.706
THROUGH WE DON'T NEED TO GO

00:36:48.773 --> 00:36:51.108
THROUGH THE WHOLE LIST BUT- WE

00:36:51.175 --> 00:36:53.678
HAVE TO BE BOLD- MY MAIN

00:36:53.744 --> 00:36:56.981
QUESTION FOR YOU IS JUST- ARE

00:36:57.048 --> 00:36:59.483
WE BOTH ENOUGH- THE GOVERNOR

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:01.385
SENT A LETTER TO THE AIR

00:37:01.452 --> 00:37:03.487
RESOURCES BOARD I BELIEVE ON

00:37:03.554 --> 00:37:06.157
FRIDAY- ASKING FOR THEM TO

00:37:06.223 --> 00:37:09.594
STUDY- THE FEASIBILITY OF A-

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:11.629
NEAR TERM. APPROACH TO

00:37:11.696 --> 00:37:15.433
NEUTRALITY ORDERED TEN AT ZERO-

00:37:15.499 --> 00:37:16.267
I THINK WE CAN ACTUALLY GO

00:37:16.334 --> 00:37:17.702
FURTHER THAN THAT ZERO I THINK

00:37:17.768 --> 00:37:19.904
WE CAN GO TO NET NEGATIVE BY

00:37:19.971 --> 00:37:20.738
THIRTY FIVE BASED ON THE MODELS

00:37:20.805 --> 00:37:23.307
WE'VE SEEN. IT HOW DO YOU HOW

00:37:23.374 --> 00:37:24.475

00:37:24.542 --> 00:37:25.977
THIS LEGISLATION ARE YOU

00:37:26.043 --> 00:37:26.978
PRECLUDING US FROM THINKING

00:37:27.044 --> 00:37:28.779
BIGGER IF TECHNOLOGY DOES

00:37:28.846 --> 00:37:30.314
ENABLE LITERACY OR BOARD SAYS

00:37:30.381 --> 00:37:33.184

THAT THIRTY FIVE VISION.

00:37:40.524 --> 00:37:42.226

OUT OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS MORE

00:39:00.771 --> 00:39:02.673
POWER TO THEM YOU KNOW WE WANT

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:04.175
MORE CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE

00:39:04.241 --> 00:39:06.010
WE WANT MORE CARBON DIOXIDE

00:39:06.077 --> 00:39:08.512
REMOVAL. BUT YOU KNOW LET'S

00:39:08.579 --> 00:39:10.448
LET'S MAKE SURE THAT THAT TO

00:39:10.514 --> 00:39:11.882
THAT THAT WE CAN DO IT IN A WAY

00:39:11.949 --> 00:39:13.918
THAT THAT IS THAT IS ACHIEVABLE

00:39:13.984 --> 00:39:16.053
AND THAT IS VERIFIABLE THE THAT

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:18.389
THE CRITERIA PORTIONS. AS IT

00:39:18.456 --> 00:39:19.523
RELATES TO THE CARBON CAPTURE

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:20.491
AND STORAGE IN THE CARBON

00:39:20.558 --> 00:39:22.593
DIOXIDE REMOVAL IT IT IT

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:24.528
DOESN'T LIMON THE TECHNOLOGY

00:39:24.595 --> 00:39:26.263
THE INVESTMENTS IN IN ANY WAY

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:27.998
ALL IT DOES IS SAYING THAT WE

00:39:28.065 --> 00:39:29.100
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S

00:39:29.166 --> 00:39:30.801
NO GREENWASHING HAPPENING HERE.

00:39:30.868 --> 00:39:33.003
THAT IS NOT BEING USED AS AN

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:35.740
EXCUSE TO CONTINUE TO IN THAT

00:39:35.806 --> 00:39:37.141
MORE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

00:39:37.208 --> 00:39:39.210
TO CONTINUE TO POLLUTE YOU KNOW

00:39:39.276 --> 00:39:43.514
OUR OUR AIR AND SO YOU KNOW IT

00:39:43.581 --> 00:39:44.849
THAT WE'RE WE'RE WORKING HAND

00:39:44.915 --> 00:39:47.585
IN HAND. WITH THE BOLD CALLS

00:39:47.651 --> 00:39:50.454
LIKE YOURS TO YOU KNOW A CHEAP

00:39:50.521 --> 00:39:52.256
CAR NINE ZERO GREENHOUSE GAS

00:39:52.323 --> 00:39:54.125
EMISSIONS EVEN EARLIER WELL

00:39:54.191 --> 00:39:55.025
MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN DO IT

00:39:55.092 --> 00:39:58.229
IN A WAY THAT IS ACTUALLY T.

00:39:58.295 --> 00:39:58.829
MOBILE AND VERIFIABLE. THANK

00:39:58.896 --> 00:39:59.964
YOU FOR THAT AND WHAT I'M

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:00.998
HEARING YOU SAY ALSO AND I

00:40:01.065 --> 00:40:02.266
THINK IT'S EXPLICIT IN THE

00:40:02.333 --> 00:40:04.435
LANGUAGES THAT. IT'S A

00:40:04.502 --> 00:40:06.270
BACKSTOPS BUT THERE'S NOTHING

00:40:06.337 --> 00:40:10.441
THAT IT'S- IT IS SOON AS IT IS

00:40:10.508 --> 00:40:12.176
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE RIGHT I

00:40:12.243 --> 00:40:13.010
THINK THERE'S LANGUAGE IN HERE

00:40:13.077 --> 00:40:15.045
THAT IS CORRECT OKAY SO NOTES

00:40:15.112 --> 00:40:16.380
THE NOTES PROVISION BECAUSE

00:40:16.447 --> 00:40:17.548
THAT THAT THAT WOULD BE THE

00:40:17.615 --> 00:40:19.049
CONCERN IS IF WE SEE THE

00:40:19.116 --> 00:40:20.618
SCOPING PLAN COME OUT FOR THIS

00:40:20.684 --> 00:40:22.720
NEXT ROUND. AND CONTINUES TO

00:40:22.787 --> 00:40:24.789
SORT OF LAG OR BE ON AMBITIOUS

00:40:24.855 --> 00:40:26.390
WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A NO

00:40:26.457 --> 00:40:28.092
OVERHANG OF OVERSUPPLY SAY ANY

00:40:28.159 --> 00:40:29.460
ALLOWANCE MARKET AND LETTING

00:40:29.527 --> 00:40:32.630
MORE PEOPLE POLLUTE- AND THAT

00:40:32.696 --> 00:40:34.999
SORT OF TWENTY THIRTY TWENTY

00:40:35.065 --> 00:40:35.966
THIRTY FIVE TRAJECTORY TO ME

00:40:36.033 --> 00:40:37.234
FEELS LIKE THE INSURANCE POLICY

00:40:37.301 --> 00:40:38.803
ESPECIALLY FOR THE FRONTLINE

00:40:38.869 --> 00:40:39.637
COMMUNITIES TO KNOW THAT THAT'S

00:40:39.703 --> 00:40:41.038
GOING TO GET DONE. I THINK

00:40:41.105 --> 00:40:43.474
YOU'VE GOT NOT JUST THE FORTY

00:40:43.541 --> 00:40:45.543
FIVE LIMIT BUT I THINK BUT I

00:40:45.609 --> 00:40:47.411
THINK SOME OF THE DIRECT

00:40:47.478 --> 00:40:49.046
REDUCTION REQUIREMENTS WILL

00:40:49.113 --> 00:40:50.014
ALSO PROVIDE SOME OF THAT

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:52.850
CERTAINTY- AND I REALLY HOPE

00:40:52.917 --> 00:40:56.620
THAT THE AIRBOARD- HEEDS OUR

00:40:56.687 --> 00:40:59.056
CALL HERE AND CONTINUES TO SORT

00:40:59.123 --> 00:41:01.525
OF THINK BG TO PULL UP SHORT-

00:41:01.592 --> 00:41:03.060
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AND I THINK

00:41:03.127 --> 00:41:04.762
FOR BOTH OUR FRIENDS IN

00:41:04.829 --> 00:41:06.063
INDUSTRY AND PEOPLE WHO WANT TO

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:08.132
INNOVATE AND CREATE JOBS WE GOT

00:41:08.199 --> 00:41:09.433
TO THINK BIG BECAUSE- WE'RE

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:11.135
GOING TO LAG BEHIND IF WE KEEP

00:41:11.202 --> 00:41:12.169
DOING IT THE OLD WAY AND SAME

00:41:12.236 --> 00:41:13.938
WITH. OUR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

00:41:14.004 --> 00:41:16.307
COMMUNITIES- SO I'LL BE

00:41:16.373 --> 00:41:18.242
SUPPORTING THE MEASURE AND

00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:21.679
APPLAUD YOU FOR IT I HOPE THAT

00:41:21.745 --> 00:41:22.279
THE OPPONENTS ALSO STUDY SOME

00:41:22.346 --> 00:41:24.048
OF THE PROVISIONS I KNOW

00:41:24.114 --> 00:41:25.416
THEY'VE YET TO COME IN TO PRINT

00:41:25.482 --> 00:41:27.084
SO HOPEFULLY BEFORE THE FLOOR

00:41:27.151 --> 00:41:28.619
THERE THERE'S THAT SORT OF

00:41:28.686 --> 00:41:30.087
DEPTH OF ENGAGEMENT BECAUSE THE

00:41:30.154 --> 00:41:30.921
WAY I READ WHAT CAME FROM THAT

00:41:30.988 --> 00:41:34.158
COMMITTEE. WAS A MUCH MORE-

00:41:34.225 --> 00:41:36.360
SORT OF- A LESS PRESCRIPTIVE

00:41:36.427 --> 00:41:38.696
APPROACH AS YOU SAID- ONE THAT

00:41:38.762 --> 00:41:40.164
GIVES A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY TO

00:41:40.231 --> 00:41:42.099
THAT KIND OF EXPERIMENTATION I

00:41:42.166 --> 00:41:43.534
LOVE THE EMPHASIS ON PERMANENCE

00:41:43.601 --> 00:41:45.803
I THINK THAT THAT CERTAINTY- IS

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:46.971
GOING TO BE CRITICAL AND IT

00:41:47.037 --> 00:41:47.938
WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO BE

00:41:48.005 --> 00:41:49.139
FOLLOW UP LEGISLATION IN SOME

00:41:49.206 --> 00:41:50.641
WAY TO PROVIDE ENOUGH LEGAL

00:41:50.708 --> 00:41:52.309
CERTAINTY AROUND THIS FRAMEWORK

00:41:52.376 --> 00:41:54.144
WHEN YOU SAY YOU'RE COMMITTED

00:41:54.211 --> 00:41:56.280
TO STORING THE CARBON FOREVER-

00:41:56.347 --> 00:41:57.214
WHAT IS HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY

00:41:57.281 --> 00:41:58.849
GUARANTEE FOREVER. AND WHAT

00:41:58.916 --> 00:42:00.618
KIND OF INSTRUMENTS DO WE NEED

00:42:00.684 --> 00:42:02.820
A LAW OR IN REGULATION- WHETHER

00:42:02.887 --> 00:42:05.522
IT'S YOU KNOW AN INSURANCE POOL

00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:08.993
FOR WAYS. TO SORT OF BUILD

00:42:09.059 --> 00:42:09.627
TRUSTS OR OTHER GUARANTEE TEE'S

00:42:09.693 --> 00:42:10.160
THERE'S A NUMBER OF MODELS

00:42:10.227 --> 00:42:11.695
AROUND THE- THAT. AND IF UK'S.

00:42:11.762 --> 00:42:13.297
AT A MODEL IN THE U. N. HAS A

00:42:13.364 --> 00:42:15.299
PROPOSAL AND- BUT A LOT OF IT

00:42:15.366 --> 00:42:17.401
HAS TO DO WITH. LAND RIGHTS AND

00:42:17.468 --> 00:42:19.203
ESTABLISHING CERTAINTY AROUND-

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:20.938
THINGS LIKE. POOR RIGHTS EVEN

00:42:21.005 --> 00:42:22.506
THE FEROCITY OF SOME OF THESE

00:42:22.573 --> 00:42:23.874
FORMATIONS AND MAKING SURE THAT

00:42:23.941 --> 00:42:24.942
THOSE WERE GONNA INVEST

00:42:25.009 --> 00:42:26.176
HOPEFULLY BILLIONS IN THE

00:42:26.243 --> 00:42:27.912
CALIFORNIA TO DO THIS WORK.

00:42:27.978 --> 00:42:30.180
KNOW THAT- YOU KNOW. THERE'S

00:42:30.247 --> 00:42:31.248
GOING TO BE VERY HIGH STANDARD

00:42:31.315 --> 00:42:33.384
ON THIS WORK BUT ALSO THAT. WE

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:34.852
LIKE YOU SAID. WE REALLY ARE

00:42:34.919 --> 00:42:35.986
COMMITTED TO MAKE IT HAPPEN SO

00:42:36.053 --> 00:42:38.255
I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR BRAVE

00:42:38.322 --> 00:42:39.723
THAT. PRONOUNCEMENT IN THAT

00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:42.893
REGARD AND- YEAH MOVES ABILITY

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:45.462
APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU

00:42:45.529 --> 00:42:48.966
OKAY SENT OUT. THANK YOU I JUST

00:42:49.033 --> 00:42:49.767
WANT TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS NOT

00:42:49.833 --> 00:42:51.769
REALLY SO MUCH ON THE BILL

00:42:51.835 --> 00:42:53.537
PARTLY JUST SOME OBSERVATIONS

00:42:53.604 --> 00:42:55.239
OF SOMEBODY WHOSE DISTRICT IS

00:42:55.306 --> 00:42:57.841
BURNING UP RIGHT NOW THIS BILL

00:42:57.908 --> 00:42:58.442
ISN'T GONNA CHANGE FORCE FIRED

00:42:58.509 --> 00:43:00.844
ALL- IT MAY MAY REDUCE CARBON.

00:43:00.911 --> 00:43:06.116
IT GOALS. BUT WE'VE HAD SEVERAL

00:43:06.183 --> 00:43:08.919
OPPORTUNITIES TO HAVE. A 98%

00:43:08.986 --> 00:43:11.155
REDUCTION IN CARBON BUT THEY

00:43:11.221 --> 00:43:12.656
1100% IN THOSE IN THOSE

00:43:12.723 --> 00:43:14.959
PROJECTS DON'T GET FUNDED. SO

00:43:15.025 --> 00:43:16.260
AND I JUST WANT TO SHARE TOO

00:43:16.327 --> 00:43:17.995
THAT THE A. R. B. WE JUST

00:43:18.062 --> 00:43:19.196
APPOINTED A NEW OARD OF THE R.

00:43:19.263 --> 00:43:20.898
B. BECAUSE THE LAST BOARD-

00:43:20.965 --> 00:43:23.167
AUDIT CAME OUT WASN'T THAT WELL

00:43:23.233 --> 00:43:25.536
AND SO GIVING THE POWER TO THE

00:43:25.602 --> 00:43:27.237
A. R. B. I THINK IS- WITHOUT

00:43:27.304 --> 00:43:29.440
SOME REALLY CLEAR DIRECTION ON

00:43:29.506 --> 00:43:30.407
HOW THEY'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY

00:43:30.474 --> 00:43:34.812
IMPLEMENT IT IS- AREA. RISKY

00:43:34.878 --> 00:43:36.613
AND I KNOW THAT WE WILL BE HERE

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:37.715
I THINK WE CAME IN TOGETHER IN

00:43:37.781 --> 00:43:39.183
THE SAME CLASS MAYBE MIGHT BE A

00:43:39.249 --> 00:43:40.317
COUPLE YEARS LONGER THAN I AM

00:43:40.384 --> 00:43:41.919
BUT I DID YOU KNOW THAT THE

00:43:41.986 --> 00:43:43.687
DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS ON HOW.

00:43:43.754 --> 00:43:45.656
THESE REGULATORS BECAUSE WE'RE

00:43:45.723 --> 00:43:47.358
GIVING THEM THE POWER YOU KNOW

00:43:47.424 --> 00:43:49.093
GET IT DONE AND MY CONFIDENCE

00:43:49.159 --> 00:43:51.829
IN THEM IS. NOT VERY HIGH AT

00:43:51.895 --> 00:43:52.896
THIS POINT WE'VE SEEN THE

00:43:52.963 --> 00:43:54.631
AUDITS COME BACK WERE. THE

00:43:54.698 --> 00:43:56.333
MONEY THAT WE SPENT THROUGH THE

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.035
A. R. B. HASN'T REALLY ACHIEVED

00:43:58.102 --> 00:43:59.737
MUCH WHEN IT COMES TO CARBON

00:43:59.803 --> 00:44:00.971
REDUCTION AND I JUST WANNA

00:44:01.038 --> 00:44:02.706
SHARE ONE LAST THING IS.

00:44:02.773 --> 00:44:04.742
SOMEBODY WHO IS IN BUSINESS AND

00:44:04.808 --> 00:44:07.478
TRYING TO SURVIVE IN CALIFORNIA

00:44:07.544 --> 00:44:09.380
HAS THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS

00:44:09.446 --> 00:44:14.685
CONTINUES TO. EXPLODE WE ARE

00:44:14.752 --> 00:44:15.953
LEADING THE WORLD SUPPOSEDLY

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:18.655
IN. TECHNOLOGY AND CARBON

00:44:18.722 --> 00:44:20.157
SEQUESTRATION AND TRYING TO

00:44:20.224 --> 00:44:21.358
TRYING TO SHOW THE WORLD BUT

00:44:21.425 --> 00:44:22.860
THE WORLD IS NOT. CATCHING UP

00:44:22.926 --> 00:44:25.029
WITH US AND SO. ALL THE GAINS

00:44:25.095 --> 00:44:27.331
WE MAKE HERE IF WE DON'T SECURE

00:44:27.398 --> 00:44:28.899
THOSE JOBS. AND THOSE

00:44:28.966 --> 00:44:31.101
TECHNOLOGIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA

00:44:31.168 --> 00:44:33.003
MAKE THEM COMPETITIVE. QUITE

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:34.371
FRANKLY THE PRODUCTS THAT WE

00:44:34.438 --> 00:44:36.306
NEED TO LIVE IN USE WILL JUST

00:44:36.373 --> 00:44:38.442
BE DEVELOP SOMEWHERE ELSE. AND

00:44:38.509 --> 00:44:39.843
THE AMOUNT OF CARBON THAT WILL

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:41.879
BE LATE RELEASED IN THOSE PROP

00:44:41.945 --> 00:44:44.014
IN THE IN THOSE TO THE- AREAS

00:44:44.081 --> 00:44:44.982
WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME

00:44:45.049 --> 00:44:48.252
LAWS WE HAVE. DOES DOES NOTHING

00:44:48.318 --> 00:44:50.187
FOR. THE CARBON OF THE WORLD

00:44:50.254 --> 00:44:51.488
WE'REALL BREATHING THE SAME

00:44:51.555 --> 00:44:53.624
CAR IN THE WORLD SO. THAT'S THE

00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:55.025
FRUSTRATION FOR ME AS A

00:44:55.092 --> 00:44:56.693
CALIFORNIAN WHO IS IN BUSINESS

00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:00.030
HERE TRYING TO. STAY AFLOAT AND

00:45:00.097 --> 00:45:01.432
IN ORDER TO KEEP MY BUSINESS

00:45:01.498 --> 00:45:02.733
RUNNING AND PROVIDE THE THINGS

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.435
THAT PEOPLE NEED WHICH AS YOU

00:45:04.501 --> 00:45:06.370
KNOW I'M A FARMER PEOPLE HAVE

00:45:06.437 --> 00:45:09.239
TO EAT EVERY DAY. BUT IF I

00:45:09.306 --> 00:45:09.740
CAN'T BE COMPETITIVE IN

00:45:09.807 --> 00:45:11.975
CALIFORNIA. THOSE JOBS ARE

00:45:12.042 --> 00:45:12.609
GOING TO GO SOME IS GOING TO

00:45:12.676 --> 00:45:14.678
PROVIDE THE FOOD FOR SOMEWHERE

00:45:14.745 --> 00:45:16.613
ELSE AND THEY'RE GONNA BE.

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:17.614
EMITTING CARBON IS TO DO THAT

00:45:17.681 --> 00:45:19.416
BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGIES WE

00:45:19.483 --> 00:45:21.285
HAVE AVAILABLE TODAY WE HAVE TO

00:45:21.351 --> 00:45:23.554
USE THERE ISN'T. A SILVER

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:25.355
BULLET IN THE TECHNOLOGY TO.

00:45:25.422 --> 00:45:26.723
MAKE MY HARVESTER BE ALL

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:30.561
ELECTRIC OR- WELL THIS ISN'T

00:45:30.627 --> 00:45:31.895
AVAILABLE AND SO WE'RE

00:45:31.962 --> 00:45:33.063
COMPETING WITH US I JUST WANT

IS TRYING TO DO. AND I THINK

00:47:07.758 --> 00:47:09.326
THERE IS THE GROWING CONSENSUS

00:47:09.393 --> 00:47:11.862
THAT WE CANNOT APPROACH- OUR

00:47:11.929 --> 00:47:13.163

CALIFORNIA- ECONOMICALLY- AS

00:47:38.388 --> 00:47:39.456
WELL AS IN A WAY THAT'S NOT

00:47:39.523 --> 00:47:40.524
CONTRIBUTING TO THE CLIMATE

00:47:40.591 --> 00:47:43.393
CRISIS THE LAST POINT I WANTED

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:45.162

BOARD IS HAS NO OVERSIGHT FROM

00:47:56.673 --> 00:47:58.709
THE LEGISLATURE AND SO THIS

00:47:58.775 --> 00:48:00.744
BILL IS TRYING TO PROVIDE THE

00:48:00.811 --> 00:48:03.080
FRAMEWORK THE LEGISLATURE'S

BASIC FRAMEWORK YOU KNOW ON ON

00:48:17.928 --> 00:48:20.464
HOW TO REGULATE THE CARBON

00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:22.165
CAPTURE AND STORAGE OF CARBON

DIOXIDE REMOVAL TECHNOLOGIES

00:48:24.301 --> 00:48:25.936
OTHER TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE NEED

00:48:26.003 --> 00:48:28.005
WE JUST TAKE THE WHOLE PLAN AND

00:48:28.071 --> 00:48:30.607
DESPERATELY NEEDS TO FIGHT THIS

00:48:30.674 --> 00:48:33.210
CLIMATE CRISIS. AND SO THIS I

00:48:33.277 --> 00:48:34.578

YOUR YEAR PASSION ABOUT THE

00:48:57.401 --> 00:48:59.403
FIRE- THAT WE ALL SHARE I THINK

00:48:59.469 --> 00:49:00.937
WE'LL PROBABLY LOOK AT IT A

00:49:01.004 --> 00:49:02.339
LITTLE DIFFERENTLY AND HOPE

00:49:02.406 --> 00:49:03.907
THEY'RE BETTER PATHWAYS SIDE TO

00:49:03.974 --> 00:49:06.743
GETTING THERE YOU SAID WE- WANT

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:07.911
THESE THINGS TO HAPPEN AND I'M

00:49:07.978 --> 00:49:10.614
ALWAYS KIND OF A DISBELIEVE- AT

00:49:10.681 --> 00:49:13.450
THAT SHOP WE GET INVOLVED WITH

00:49:13.517 --> 00:49:16.520
CARBS HOW WE SEND THEM THESE.

00:49:16.586 --> 00:49:18.522
TOOLS WHICH SOMETIMES ARE VERY

00:49:18.588 --> 00:49:20.157
ELUSIVE AND EXPECT IT JUST TO

00:49:20.223 --> 00:49:21.391
HAPPEN AND NEVER COMES BACK

00:49:21.458 --> 00:49:23.527
HERE RIGHT NOW I THINK WE HAVE

00:49:23.593 --> 00:49:25.362
THE AN AUDIT THAT SAYS THEY

00:49:25.429 --> 00:49:27.331
AREN'T EVEN CERTAIN ABOUT

00:49:27.397 --> 00:49:29.666
MEETING THE GOALS AND TWENTY

00:49:29.733 --> 00:49:31.835
THIRTY HARM BASED ON A SCOPING

00:49:31.902 --> 00:49:33.770
PLAN THAT STILL IS THE ALL

00:49:33.837 --> 00:49:35.138
INCLUSIVE IN TERMS OF WHAT ARE

00:49:35.205 --> 00:49:37.240
THE PATHWAYS AND I GUESS ONE OF

00:49:37.307 --> 00:49:40.811
MY QUESTIONS IS GOING TO BE ON.

00:49:40.877 --> 00:49:42.379
WHY IT WHY IS THERE AN URGENCY

00:49:42.446 --> 00:49:44.348
TO MOVE THIS BILL BEFORE THAT

00:49:44.414 --> 00:49:46.750
PROCESS FOR SB THIRTY TWO IS

00:49:46.817 --> 00:49:48.652
COMPLETED LET ME THROW ANOTHER

00:49:48.719 --> 00:49:49.753
ONE BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:51.588
WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM. OUR

00:49:51.655 --> 00:49:53.156
THE MULTITUDE OF OPPOSITION

00:49:53.223 --> 00:49:54.391
THAT YOU HEARD THERE THERE IS

00:49:54.458 --> 00:49:56.426
FEAR OBVIOUSLY COMING OUT OF

00:49:56.493 --> 00:49:58.195
THE PANDEMIC COMING OUT OF. A

00:49:58.261 --> 00:49:59.796
RECESSION THAT'S NOT THAT MANY

00:49:59.863 --> 00:50:02.232
YEARS AGO OUR ECONOMY IS BEEN

00:50:02.299 --> 00:50:04.468
SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED-

00:50:04.534 --> 00:50:06.370
CERTAINLY MOVING TO GREEN JOBS

00:50:06.436 --> 00:50:10.006
HASN'T BEEN AS- FAVORITE. AS

00:50:10.073 --> 00:50:13.310
WAS ASSUME SO. I'LL HAVE THE

00:50:13.377 --> 00:50:15.645
MANY ANALYSIS ALONG THE WAY OF

00:50:15.712 --> 00:50:17.914
WHAT THESE ARE TARGETS MEAN FOR

00:50:17.981 --> 00:50:20.016
THE ECONOMY. ARE IS THERE ANY

00:50:20.083 --> 00:50:21.518
CONSIDERATION FOR THE COST

00:50:21.585 --> 00:50:23.120
EFFECTIVE ENOUGH THAT THAT

00:50:23.186 --> 00:50:25.222
SHOULD BE ANALYZE AND- INFER

00:50:25.288 --> 00:50:27.257
FINALLY ARM I DON'T THINK

00:50:27.324 --> 00:50:30.026
THERE'D BE THE IF- HUGE.

00:50:30.093 --> 00:50:32.062
OPPOSITION IF THERE HAD BEEN

00:50:32.129 --> 00:50:34.264
MORE OUR DISCUSSION NOW WITH

00:50:34.331 --> 00:50:35.699
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE

00:50:35.766 --> 00:50:37.501
STAKEHOLDERS WHICH I BELIEVE.

00:50:37.567 --> 00:50:42.706
OCCURRED AT IN THE PREVIOUS-

00:50:42.773 --> 00:50:43.340
TARGETS THAT WERE SET. WHAT ANY

00:50:43.407 --> 00:50:45.909
OF THAT. IF ON YOU STILL HAVE A

00:50:45.976 --> 00:50:47.310
HUGE AMOUNT OF OPPOSITION SO

00:50:47.377 --> 00:50:48.578
MAYBE YOU CAN TAKE THEM ALL

00:50:48.645 --> 00:50:50.981
TOGETHER TALK TO US ABOUT. HOW

00:50:51.047 --> 00:50:51.815
WE'RE GONNA GET THERE WHEN THE

00:50:51.882 --> 00:50:53.483
SCOPING PLAN RIGHT NOW STILL

00:50:53.550 --> 00:50:56.720
ELUSIVE- IS THERE GOING TO BE

00:50:56.787 --> 00:50:58.722
COST EFFECTIVENESS THAT'S

00:50:58.789 --> 00:51:00.123
REQUIRED F CARD TO TAKE A LOOK

00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:01.925
AT WHEN THEY START DOWN THAT

00:51:01.992 --> 00:51:03.527
PATH AND FRANKLY WOULDN'T

00:51:03.593 --> 00:51:05.128
WONDERFUL PATHWAY. WHAT ARE THE

00:51:05.195 --> 00:51:07.731
PATHWAYS WE HAVEN'T EVEN HAD A

00:51:07.798 --> 00:51:09.533
REAL IN DEPTH DISCUSSION OF

00:51:09.599 --> 00:51:11.768
THAT. ARE HOW WE GET AND WHAT

00:51:11.835 --> 00:51:13.870
TECHNOLOGIES ARE OUT THERE IT'S

00:51:13.937 --> 00:51:15.038
VERY INTERESTING WHEN YOU SPENT

00:51:15.105 --> 00:51:16.339
A WEEKEND WATCHING AN

00:51:16.406 --> 00:51:17.808
INDIVIDUAL GET US TO THE EDGE

00:51:17.874 --> 00:51:19.709
OF SPACE BECAUSE HE DECIDED WE

00:51:19.776 --> 00:51:22.379
NEEDED TO DO THAT. AND I DIDN'T

00:51:22.446 --> 00:51:24.080
GET HUNG UP IN THE BUREAUCRACY

00:51:24.147 --> 00:51:25.282
AND WHEN WE HAVE THOSE

00:51:25.348 --> 00:51:28.452
INNOVATORS OUT THERE AND WE-

00:51:28.518 --> 00:51:30.387
RESTRAIN THEM WITH THE

00:51:30.454 --> 00:51:31.922
BUREAUCRACY THAT THIS KIND OF

00:51:31.988 --> 00:51:34.191
STUFF- UP- HOW ARE WE GOING TO

00:51:34.257 --> 00:51:36.359
GET THOSE TECHNOLOGIES IT FOR

00:51:36.426 --> 00:51:37.994
NOT LETTING. EVERYBODY HAVE A

00:51:38.061 --> 00:51:39.529
HAVE A FAIR SHOT AT IT AND NOT

WITH WHAT THIS PRESENTS OF THE

00:51:49.539 --> 00:51:51.975
SOLUTION- I THINK IT'S VERY

INDICATED THAT PEOPLE ARE GONNA

01:11:13.702 --> 01:11:14.970
BY THE C. BIKES AND THEY'RE

01:11:15.037 --> 01:11:16.038
GONNA GET OUT OF THEIR CARS AND

01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:18.607

BUT- THE STAFF REPORT INDICATES

01:11:28.283 --> 01:11:31.320
AT LEAST. IN EUROPE TO SIX X.

01:11:31.387 --> 01:11:32.855
EXHAUSTIVE STUDIES THEY CAME UP

01:11:32.921 --> 01:11:34.523
TO SAY REALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS

01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:35.491
THAT YOU GET PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:11:35.557 --> 01:11:37.760
REGULAR BICYCLE RIDERS. SWITCH

01:11:37.826 --> 01:11:39.695
THE BIG MOVEMENT IS THE BICYCLE

01:11:39.762 --> 01:11:41.063
RIDERS SWITCHING TO E. BIKES

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:42.798
THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF PEOPLE

01:11:42.865 --> 01:11:47.236
GETTING OUT OF THEIR CARS. AND-

01:11:47.302 --> 01:11:48.771
DOING ANY PART I GUESS IS

01:11:48.837 --> 01:11:52.041
THERE'S TWO STUDIES. I DIDN'T I

01:11:52.107 --> 01:11:55.611
MISS WERE YOU. IT I GUESS THE

01:11:55.678 --> 01:11:57.079
EVIDENCE THAT YOU HAD THAT THIS

01:11:57.146 --> 01:11:57.646
IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

01:11:57.713 --> 01:12:01.583
THIS- WATERFALL OF PEOPLE MY

01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:04.987
ANY BIKES WITH THIS LEGISLATION

01:12:05.054 --> 01:12:07.056
SO FAR COULD SENATOR I THINK

01:12:07.122 --> 01:12:07.790
THE IMPORTANT THING IS WHO CAN

01:12:07.856 --> 01:12:09.458
AFFORD THEM AND I THINK IN

01:12:09.525 --> 01:12:10.826
EUROPE AS SOMEBODY WHO LIVED IN

01:12:10.893 --> 01:12:13.162
EUROPE FOR TWELVE YEARS AND

01:12:13.228 --> 01:12:14.163
RODE MY BIKE EVERYWHERE BY

01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:16.398
COMMUTED- MANY PLACES IN EUROPE

01:12:16.465 --> 01:12:18.867
ARE VERY FLAT WHERE I LIVED- IT

01:12:18.934 --> 01:12:20.302
WAS EASY TO RIDE MY BIKE. EVERY

01:12:20.369 --> 01:12:21.804
DAY MANY PLACES IN CALIFORNIA

01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:24.206
ARE NOT FLAT SO MY TOWN FOR

01:12:24.273 --> 01:12:26.108
EXAMPLE IS A LOT OF BIG HILLS.

01:12:26.175 --> 01:12:27.676
TO GO TO AND THAT WOULD BE

01:12:27.743 --> 01:12:28.711
PROHIBITIVE FOR A LOT OF

01:12:28.777 --> 01:12:30.446
RECREATIONAL USERS TO USE A

01:12:30.512 --> 01:12:31.780
REGULAR BICYCLE. AND WHAT

01:12:31.847 --> 01:12:32.715
YOU'LL SEE IS YOU'LL SEE

01:12:32.781 --> 01:12:35.984
ADOPTION OF A WIDER RANGE. IN

01:12:36.051 --> 01:12:37.586
CALIFORNIA OF THOSE WHO

01:12:37.653 --> 01:12:40.122
ADOPTING EVEN MAKES- FIRST OF

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:42.958
ALL AND SECOND OF ALL- I THINK

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:44.626
WHEN WE LOOK AT GENERAL

01:12:44.693 --> 01:12:46.495
INFRASTRUCTURE IN EUROPE VERSUS

01:12:46.562 --> 01:12:48.831
A CALIFORNIA. FOR BIKES IT'S

01:12:48.897 --> 01:12:50.032
QUITE DIFFERENT SO I'M NOT SURE

01:12:50.099 --> 01:12:52.267
EUROPEAN STUDY COULD REALLY IS

01:12:52.334 --> 01:12:54.403
REALLY ACCURATE FOR DESCRIBING

01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:55.571
CALIFORNIA HAS NOT BEEN MY

01:12:55.637 --> 01:12:57.673
EXPERIENCE AS A CYCLIST. THEY

01:12:57.740 --> 01:12:59.541
ARE EQUIVALENT ME AND I KNOW

01:12:59.608 --> 01:13:01.710
LIKE FOR EXAMPLE MYSELF IF I

01:13:01.777 --> 01:13:03.746
USED TO BUY COMMUTE. AND SO I

01:13:03.812 --> 01:13:05.013
WHEN WE MOVED BACK HERE FROM

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:07.483
GERMANY I GOT A TWELVE HUNDRED

01:13:07.549 --> 01:13:10.152
DOLLAR HE JODY BIKE. AND THAT

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:11.487
REPLACE THE CAR WITH HIM BY A

01:13:11.553 --> 01:13:13.922
SECOND CAR. AND I BY COMMUNITY

01:13:13.989 --> 01:13:15.257
GO SEVEN MILES MEDICAL DOES

01:13:15.324 --> 01:13:17.426
GIANT HELL. AND I WOULD NOT

01:13:17.493 --> 01:13:19.394
HAVE DONE THAT HAD I NOT HAD AN

01:13:19.461 --> 01:13:21.430
E. BIKE. NOW I CAN AFFORD IT SO

01:13:21.497 --> 01:13:23.298
I'M NOT THE TARGET OF THIS BILL

01:13:23.365 --> 01:13:24.466
THERE ARE MANY CALIFORNIANS

01:13:24.533 --> 01:13:26.335
THOUGH WHO NEED THAT AND CENTER

01:13:26.401 --> 01:13:28.737
VOUCHER. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE

01:13:28.804 --> 01:13:32.107
TO- ACTUALLY ADOPT IT AND AS I

01:13:32.174 --> 01:13:33.909
SAID THIS WEEKEND WE WENT TO

01:13:33.976 --> 01:13:34.877
THE BEACH ONCE AND WE DIDN'T

01:13:34.943 --> 01:13:36.578
TAKE A CAR. WE WENT TO THE

01:13:36.645 --> 01:13:38.046
STORE TO PICK UP MY MEN'S

01:13:38.113 --> 01:13:39.715
BECAUSE WE WERE DOING MY

01:13:39.782 --> 01:13:41.683
MANDATE- AND WE DON'T USE A

01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:43.752
CAR. SO THE STUDY THAT WE'RE

01:13:43.819 --> 01:13:47.222
CITING SHOWS 43% OF E. BIKE

01:13:47.289 --> 01:13:49.191
OWNERS REPLACE CAR TRIPS WITH

01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:50.726
BIKE TRIPS AND THAT'S THE TYPE

01:13:50.793 --> 01:13:52.060
OF EMISSIONS REDUCTION. THAT WE

01:13:52.127 --> 01:13:53.662
WANT TO SEE WITH THIS PROGRAM.

01:13:53.729 --> 01:13:55.264
AND WE WANT TO SEE IT.

01:13:55.330 --> 01:13:56.932
ACCESSIBLE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS

01:13:56.999 --> 01:13:57.666
PRESSURE LOW INCOME

01:13:57.733 --> 01:13:59.802
CALIFORNIANS. WELL I'M GOOD I'M

01:13:59.868 --> 01:14:01.470
ALL MOVED A BILL I'M JUST

01:14:01.537 --> 01:14:03.338
SAYING THAT YOU HAVE A STEADY

01:14:03.405 --> 01:14:04.673
THERE'S OTHER TO OTHER STUDIES

01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:06.642
THERE. AND THERE'S A LOT OF

01:14:06.708 --> 01:14:08.710
INTO TOTAL INFORMATION AND I

01:14:08.777 --> 01:14:10.245
THINK OF JIM BELL WE'RE SITTING

01:14:10.312 --> 01:14:12.080
UP HERE. HE WOULD SAY THE

01:14:12.147 --> 01:14:13.248
AMOUNT OF GREEN PAINT THAT'S

01:14:13.315 --> 01:14:14.583
BEING SPENT BY CITIES AND

01:14:14.650 --> 01:14:16.285
COUNTIES TO PUT BY CLINGS AND

01:14:16.351 --> 01:14:21.824
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. FOR SB

01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:23.392
ONE IS. FOR IS CHANGING THE

01:14:23.458 --> 01:14:24.693
LAND. I MEAN YOU GO A LOT OF US.

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:27.796
RIGHT WHAT WE MAY NOT. ALL IN

01:14:27.863 --> 01:14:28.897
WE DO HAVE A LOT OF BIKE LANES

01:14:28.964 --> 01:14:30.332
ARE BEING PUT RIGHT NOW I THINK

01:14:30.399 --> 01:14:32.334
THE LAST TWENTY FOUR MONTHS

01:14:32.401 --> 01:14:34.269
HAVE BEEN EXTRAORDINARY AT

01:14:34.336 --> 01:14:35.470
LEAST IN THE BAY AREA WHERE

01:14:35.537 --> 01:14:37.272
I'VE GONE RUNNING SO ALL USE

01:14:37.339 --> 01:14:39.441
IT- EIGHT ATTENTION I HOPE

01:14:39.508 --> 01:14:42.077
IT'S- WILDLY SUCCESSFUL BUT I'M

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:43.078
JUST SAYING THAT THE

01:14:43.145 --> 01:14:44.479
INFORMATION THEY'RE SAYING IS.

01:14:44.546 --> 01:14:46.281
IT IS SHOWING IS THAT YES FOR

01:14:46.348 --> 01:14:47.783
THE WEEKEND WE MIGHT NOT DO IT

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:51.320
BUT FOR FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE HI I

01:14:51.386 --> 01:14:53.255
AM I AM. I JUST BRING IT UP

01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:54.356
BECAUSE YOU'RE SAYING THESE ARE

01:14:54.423 --> 01:14:56.158
PEOPLE WHO ORDINARILY THEY'RE

01:14:56.225 --> 01:14:57.426
ALREADY RIDING BIKES AND THEY

01:14:57.492 --> 01:14:58.760
GO TO GO TO THE E. BIKE WHICH

01:14:58.827 --> 01:15:00.796
IS THE BIG SHIFT WHICH- MIGHT

01:15:00.863 --> 01:15:02.564
BE A GOOD THING YOU KNOW HE

01:15:02.631 --> 01:15:03.699
LESS SWEATY WHEN YOU SHOP AT

01:15:03.765 --> 01:15:05.534
WORK WELL AND I WAS THAT'S WHAT

01:15:05.601 --> 01:15:06.401
IT DOES TO BE HONEST LIKE

01:15:06.468 --> 01:15:07.236
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT

01:15:07.302 --> 01:15:09.204
YOU MIGHT WORKED. I WOULD

01:15:09.271 --> 01:15:11.807
QUESTION THE USING STUDIES FROM

01:15:11.874 --> 01:15:12.808
EUROPE THAT HAS A VERY

01:15:12.875 --> 01:15:13.742
DIFFERENT LANDSCAPE HAS A

01:15:13.809 --> 01:15:15.611
DIFFERENT TRANSIT LANDSCAPE

01:15:15.677 --> 01:15:17.112
THEN WE HAVE MAYBE THE BAY AREA

01:15:17.179 --> 01:15:19.014
APPROXIMATES IT MORE THAN THAT

01:15:19.081 --> 01:15:21.183
IN MY AREA OF NORTH COUNTY SAN

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:24.086
DIEGO- ABOUT I HEAR IT I HEAR

01:15:24.152 --> 01:15:25.420
YOUR POINT THAT WE NEED TO LOOK

01:15:25.487 --> 01:15:27.256
AT IT. BUT I DO THINK THIS BILL

01:15:27.322 --> 01:15:28.824
IS ABOUT MAKING IT A YOU KNOW

01:15:28.891 --> 01:15:30.692
MAKING E. BIKES ACCESSIBLE AND

01:15:30.759 --> 01:15:32.127
REPLACING CAR TRIPS AND I WOULD

01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:33.629
SAY MOST OF EUROPE IS NOT

01:15:33.695 --> 01:15:35.497
DEPENDENT ON A CAR IN THE SAME

01:15:35.564 --> 01:15:37.499
WAY THAT WE IN CALIFORNIA ARE.

01:15:37.566 --> 01:15:40.936
SO. REPLACING THOSE TRIPS I

01:15:41.003 --> 01:15:43.739
THINK ARE REALLY IMPORTANT. YES

01:15:43.805 --> 01:15:46.575
HI- ARGUMENTS FOR A BILL THAT I

01:15:46.642 --> 01:15:47.609

01:15:52.114 --> 01:15:52.848
YOU HAVE TO CHARGE E. BIKE

02:35:25.549 --> 02:35:26.917
QUANTIFIED TERMS ABOUT SOME OF

02:35:26.984 --> 02:35:28.318
THE HEALTH IMPACTS THAT OUR

02:35:28.385 --> 02:35:29.620
LANDSCAPE PROFESSIONALS ARE IN

02:35:29.687 --> 02:35:31.588
DURING BUT ALSO. THAT YOU KNOW

02:35:31.655 --> 02:35:32.523
WITH THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION

02:35:32.589 --> 02:35:34.291
ABOUT IMPACTS OF PORTABLE

02:35:34.358 --> 02:35:36.727
GENERATORS- AND HOW CRUCIAL

02:35:36.794 --> 02:35:38.762
THEY CAN BE- TO HOMEOWNERS

02:35:38.829 --> 02:35:40.097
WE'VE HAD MORE PUBLIC SAFETY

02:35:40.164 --> 02:35:41.498
POWER SHUT OFFS IN MY DISTRICT

02:35:41.565 --> 02:35:42.566
THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE STATE

02:35:42.633 --> 02:35:45.302
OF CALIFORNIA. BUT THE RECENT

02:35:45.369 --> 02:35:47.604
DATA WE'VE BEEN SEEING IS THAT-

02:35:47.671 --> 02:35:49.907
MISUSE OF THOSE EYES ARE DEEP

02:35:49.973 --> 02:35:51.542
EITHER DIESEL OR GAS POWERED

02:35:51.608 --> 02:35:53.510
GENERATORS ACTUALLY. VERY

02:35:53.577 --> 02:35:55.012
DANGEROUS AND EVEN DEADLY I

02:35:55.079 --> 02:35:57.047
THINK CONSUMER REPORTS THE WHAT

02:35:57.114 --> 02:35:58.482
I JUST SAW WAS IDON'T KNOW IF

02:35:58.549 --> 02:36:00.184
THERE'S MORE RECENT DATA BUT

02:36:00.250 --> 02:36:03.153
FROM 200-052-2017 NINE HUNDRED

02:36:03.220 --> 02:36:05.189
PEOPLE DIED. OF CARBON MONOXIDE

02:36:05.255 --> 02:36:07.091
POISONING AND THE THOUSANDS OF

02:36:07.157 --> 02:36:10.394
BEEN POISONED- ON TOP OF THAT

02:36:10.461 --> 02:36:11.495
AND YOU KNOW I KNOW THROUGH

02:36:11.562 --> 02:36:12.963
THESE P. S. P. S. INCIDENTS

02:36:13.030 --> 02:36:15.432
WE'VE HAD A FEW DEATHS-

02:36:15.499 --> 02:36:16.700
EXPECTANT MOTHER IN TAX SHOULD

02:36:16.767 --> 02:36:19.970
BE- LAST YEAR- AND AT A

02:36:20.037 --> 02:36:22.005
PERSONAL LEVEL YOU KNOW WHEN

02:36:22.072 --> 02:36:22.606
WE'VE GONE THROUGH THESE P. S.

02:36:22.673 --> 02:36:25.776
P. S. INCIDENTS. OR WHEN- YOU

02:36:25.843 --> 02:36:27.411
KNOW WHATEVER THAT THAT-

02:36:27.478 --> 02:36:31.615
LANDSCAPING EQUIPMENT IS BREAK

02:36:31.682 --> 02:36:32.216
BEHIND MY HOUSE THAT'S GOING.

02:36:32.282 --> 02:36:34.752
WHEN MY WIFE'S OUTSIDE SHE

02:36:34.818 --> 02:36:36.520
SEVEN HALF MONTHS PREGNANT SHE

02:36:36.587 --> 02:36:37.921
LIKES THE SOUND OF YEAH THE

02:36:37.988 --> 02:36:39.623
NEIGHBORHOODS BUZZING PEOPLE

02:36:39.690 --> 02:36:40.190
ARE WORKING YOU KNOW THERE'S

02:36:40.257 --> 02:36:42.926
SORT OF. NO NO CONCERNED ABOUT

02:36:42.993 --> 02:36:44.428
EVEN NOISE OR PEOPLE DOING

02:36:44.495 --> 02:36:47.131
THEIR JOBS BUT- THE NOTION OF

02:36:47.197 --> 02:36:48.432
BENZENE AND CARBON MONOXIDE

02:36:48.499 --> 02:36:49.333
GOING INTO THE LUNGS OF

02:36:49.399 --> 02:36:50.400
PREGNANT WOMEN AROUND

02:36:50.467 --> 02:36:51.802
CALIFORNIA WHICH IS HAPPENING

02:36:51.869 --> 02:36:53.270
RIGHT NOW I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW

02:36:53.337 --> 02:36:55.773
MUCH QUANTIFY LIKE. WHAT OTHER

02:36:55.839 --> 02:36:57.241
DATA BESIDES THAT TO TWO

02:36:57.307 --> 02:36:58.275
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN BUT- I THINK

02:36:58.342 --> 02:36:59.276
THERE'S A THERE'S A CRITICAL

02:36:59.343 --> 02:37:00.744
CASE TO BE MADE ON THAT THE

02:37:00.811 --> 02:37:01.845
HEALTH SIDE OF THIS LEGISLATION

02:37:01.912 --> 02:37:03.680
NOT JUST. IMPROVEMENTS IN THE

02:37:03.747 --> 02:37:05.749
TECHNOLOGY- AND I'M REALLY

02:37:05.816 --> 02:37:06.683
ENCOURAGES THE WITH THE

02:37:06.750 --> 02:37:07.818
INDUSTRY'S COMING UP WITH I

02:37:07.885 --> 02:37:09.253
DON'T SEE ANY LACK OF CAPITAL

02:37:09.319 --> 02:37:10.554
BY THE WAY COMING IN EITHER I

02:37:10.621 --> 02:37:12.356
THINK PORTAL GENERATOR SALES

02:37:12.422 --> 02:37:14.258
REP 2000% I THINK SINCE OUR PS

02:37:14.324 --> 02:37:15.726
PS STUFF BEGINNING CALIFORNIA

02:37:15.793 --> 02:37:17.127
SO THERE'S PLENTY CAPITAL I

02:37:17.194 --> 02:37:18.195
KNOW THERE'S THE KNOW HOW

02:37:18.262 --> 02:37:20.697
WITHIN. WHETHER IT'S GENERAC-

02:37:20.764 --> 02:37:22.466
YOU KNOW- SOME OF YOU KNOW GET

02:37:22.533 --> 02:37:24.201
YAMAHA KAWASAKI THESE ARE THESE

02:37:24.268 --> 02:37:25.903
ARE SMART COMPANIES I THINK WE

02:37:25.969 --> 02:37:27.871
CAN FIGURE THIS STUFF OUT BUT-

02:37:27.938 --> 02:37:29.139
JUST DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU YOU ARE

02:37:29.206 --> 02:37:30.941
YOUR SPONSORS WANTED LENT ANY

02:37:31.008 --> 02:37:33.911
INSIGHT ON THE- THE NEAR TERM

02:37:33.977 --> 02:37:35.045
HEALTH IMPACTS ON EITHER OF

02:37:35.112 --> 02:37:36.280
THOSE ISSUES YES THANK YOU

02:37:36.346 --> 02:37:37.781
CENTER FOR. FURTHER COMMENTS IN

02:37:37.848 --> 02:37:39.716
QUESTION AND- YEAH LIKE YOU

02:37:39.783 --> 02:37:40.651
SAID THIS PLAN CAPITAL THEY

02:37:40.717 --> 02:37:42.686
ALSO HAVE MORE TIME ON THE

02:37:42.753 --> 02:37:43.554
GENERATOR FRONT BECAUSE CARP IS

02:37:43.620 --> 02:37:45.255
PLANNING TO. HAVE THE

02:37:45.322 --> 02:37:46.356
IMPLEMENTATION DATE FOR

02:37:46.423 --> 02:37:47.524
GENERATORS BE TWENTY TWENTY

02:37:47.591 --> 02:37:49.426
EIGHT- SO THAT THAT SEVEN YEARS

02:37:49.493 --> 02:37:50.627
FROM NOW AND WE KNOW THAT THE

02:37:50.694 --> 02:37:52.429
TECHNOLOGY ALREADY EXISTS

02:37:52.496 --> 02:37:53.797
THAT'S A LOT OF TIME TO IMPROVE

02:37:53.864 --> 02:37:56.033
IT AND TO BRING THE COST DOWN.

02:37:56.099 --> 02:37:56.733
TO HAVE A BE MORE COST

02:37:56.800 --> 02:37:58.602
COMPARABLE. WITH THE GAS

02:37:58.669 --> 02:38:00.971
POWERED ALTERNATIVES- THE QUICK

02:38:01.038 --> 02:38:02.539
TOUCHING ON GENERATORS THE BILL

02:38:02.606 --> 02:38:03.740
APPLIES TO SPARK IGNITION

02:38:03.807 --> 02:38:05.776
PORTABLE GENERATORS UNDER

02:38:05.843 --> 02:38:07.077
TWENTY FIVE HORSEPOWER- SO

02:38:07.144 --> 02:38:08.679
LARGE STATIONARY GENERATORS AND

02:38:08.745 --> 02:38:09.980
DIESEL GENERATORS ARE NOT

02:38:10.047 --> 02:38:12.649
SUBJECT SUBJECT TO THIS BILL-

02:38:12.716 --> 02:38:13.817
SO THEY YOU KNOW FOR PEOPLE

02:38:13.884 --> 02:38:14.852
STILL CAN USE THOSE IF THEY

02:38:14.918 --> 02:38:16.753
NEED TO YOU MADE A GOOD POINT

02:38:16.820 --> 02:38:17.855
THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN. IF YOU

02:38:17.921 --> 02:38:19.489
THE MISUSE THEM AND THERE CAN

02:38:19.556 --> 02:38:21.058
BE DEADLY HEALTH CONSEQUENCES

02:38:21.124 --> 02:38:22.159
TO THAT END OF THE SMALLER ONES

02:38:22.226 --> 02:38:23.794
AS WELL. THE ZERO EMISSION

02:38:23.861 --> 02:38:24.895
GENERATORS HAVE A HIGHER PRICE

02:38:24.962 --> 02:38:25.896
NOW WHICH IS WHY THE PROPOSED

02:38:25.963 --> 02:38:27.130
REGULATIONS OF A LATER PHASE

02:38:27.197 --> 02:38:28.365
AND A LIKE I MENTIONED TWENTY

02:38:28.432 --> 02:38:31.602
TWENTY EIGHT- AND- GOT A

02:38:31.668 --> 02:38:32.703
TALKING POINT THAT I HAVE REAL

02:38:32.769 --> 02:38:33.704
QUICK IS EXPOSURE TO

02:38:33.770 --> 02:38:34.938
CARCINOGENIC THIS APARTMENT

02:38:35.005 --> 02:38:40.244
CLOSE TO WILL NOW. NOT BE PART

02:38:40.310 --> 02:38:41.745
OF MY CLOTHES- X. TO CAR.

02:38:41.812 --> 02:38:43.113
AIRPORT AND HIGH LEVELS OF.

02:38:43.180 --> 02:38:43.647
FINE PARTICLES THAT CAUSE

02:38:43.714 --> 02:38:45.716
ASTHMA ANOTHER US- TESSA'S. TO

02:38:45.782 --> 02:38:49.353
BE FORTY TIMES HIGHER- FOUR

02:38:49.419 --> 02:38:52.189
TIMES HIGHER THAN A TO- EXCUSE

02:38:52.256 --> 02:38:53.423
ME. TESTS HAVE SHOWN TO BE

02:38:53.490 --> 02:38:54.725
FORTY TIMES HIGHER. IF YOU'RE

02:38:54.791 --> 02:38:56.326
NEAR A TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN.

02:38:56.393 --> 02:38:59.096
MODEL LEAF BLOWER. THEN IF

02:38:59.162 --> 02:39:00.731
YOU'RE NEAR A BUSY INTERSECTION-

02:39:00.797 --> 02:39:02.299
AND THEN TO THAT JUST GIVES YOU

02:39:02.366 --> 02:39:04.635
A SENSE OF THE- YOU KNOW

02:39:04.701 --> 02:39:06.737
EXACTLY HOW THE HEALTH IMPACTS.

02:39:06.803 --> 02:39:07.938
I CAN BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF

02:39:08.005 --> 02:39:09.206

TO UPGRADE THE STANDARDS AND

02:39:17.948 --> 02:39:19.316
MAKE THE TRANSITION TO ZERO

02:39:19.383 --> 02:39:21.151
EMISSION EQUIPMENT. AND AS YOU

02:39:21.218 --> 02:39:23.654
KNOW THERE ARE ZERO EMISSION

02:39:23.720 --> 02:39:26.290
GENERATORS AVAILABLE FUEL CELLS

02:39:26.356 --> 02:39:27.791
BATTERY POWERED WHEN YOUR

02:39:27.858 --> 02:39:29.526
GENERATORS AND WE NEED TO

02:39:29.593 --> 02:39:31.228
ACCELERATE THAT TRANSITION SO

02:39:31.295 --> 02:39:31.995

CIGARETTE THAT. I DID NOT SEE.

02:40:51.975 --> 02:40:53.076

THE FIRST THE WITNESS THAT TED

02:41:00.650 --> 02:41:02.185
WENT ON REALLY FAST I COULDN'T

02:41:02.252 --> 02:41:03.887
CATCH ALL THE DETAILS. BUT

02:41:03.954 --> 02:41:05.489
THERE HAS BEEN SOME TALK ABOUT

02:41:05.555 --> 02:41:07.190
HOW THE DATA WAS GATHERED COULD

02:41:07.257 --> 02:41:09.192
YOU RESPOND TO THAT FIRST OFF

02:41:09.259 --> 02:41:13.196
YES MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT.

02:41:13.263 --> 02:41:17.534
THAT THE DATA- WITH SOME FROM A

02:41:17.601 --> 02:41:19.236
PHONE SURVEY- THAT WAS A

02:41:19.302 --> 02:41:20.904
COMPONENT OF CARBS TWENTY

02:41:20.971 --> 02:41:22.172
TWENTY INVENTORY MODELING AND

02:41:22.239 --> 02:41:23.740
THAT CARBON VAULT INDUSTRY TO

02:41:23.807 --> 02:41:25.675
ENGAGE WITH DATA AND IDENTIFY

02:41:25.742 --> 02:41:28.545
OUT LIARS AND THE DATA THE DATA

02:41:28.612 --> 02:41:29.646
IS CURRENTLY WHAT WE HAVE

02:41:29.713 --> 02:41:31.214
INDUSTRY HASN'T PROVIDED ANY

02:41:31.281 --> 02:41:33.216
ALTERNATIVE DTA- SOURCE OF

02:41:33.283 --> 02:41:36.586
EMISSIONS- SO- YOU KNOW VERY

02:41:36.653 --> 02:41:38.588
OPEN TO IT TO. DIVING INTO THAT

02:41:38.655 --> 02:41:40.390
MORE WITH INDUSTRY IF THEY WANT

TO PROVIDE SOME ALTERNATIVE

02:41:41.024 --> 02:41:43.527
DATA FOR US TO LOOK AT WELL I

02:41:43.593 --> 02:41:45.228
DON'T THINK THAT WE'RE MAKING

02:41:45.295 --> 02:41:47.364
SOME REALLY- THIS ISN'T THIS IS

02:41:47.431 --> 02:41:50.500
A BIG PIECE OF LEGISLATION I

02:41:50.567 --> 02:41:51.368
THINK THIS IS GONNA BE VERY.

02:41:51.435 --> 02:41:53.136
BURDENS ON SPECIALLY PEOPLE

02:41:53.203 --> 02:41:55.605
WITH WHO ARE EXPERIENCING. IN A

02:41:55.672 --> 02:41:58.008
PUBLIC CAR SAFETY SHUT OFFS-

02:41:58.075 --> 02:41:59.843
AND I DID I JUST GOOGLE WHY WE

02:41:59.910 --> 02:42:02.179
WERE SITTING HERE- TWENTY FIVE

02:42:02.245 --> 02:42:04.648
HORSEPOWER IS FOUR HUNDRED AND

02:42:04.714 --> 02:42:05.515
THIRTY FIVE CC SO YOU'RE

02:42:05.582 --> 02:42:07.951
TALKING ABOUT FORTY SPECIES

02:42:08.018 --> 02:42:09.953
WHICH IS A VERY SMALL.

02:42:10.020 --> 02:42:11.521
GENERATOR WHICH CAN YOU KNOW

THINK THAT. YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T

02:42:27.737 --> 02:42:30.373
A- NOT WELL THOUGHT OUT YET I

02:42:30.440 --> 02:42:31.942
THINK WE NEED MORE DATA I THINK

02:42:32.008 --> 02:42:33.577
THE DATA IS A LITTLE BIT SKEWED

02:42:33.643 --> 02:42:35.879
I THINK THAT- MORE I'D LIKE TO

02:42:35.946 --> 02:42:37.481
SEE MORE O A CARROT AND A

02:42:37.547 --> 02:42:39.349
STICK I FOR CHRISTMAS BY

02:42:39.416 --> 02:42:43.253
MYSELF- ACTUALLY A WHOLE SET OF

02:42:43.320 --> 02:42:45.722
CORDLESS. IMPACT WRENCHES I

02:42:45.789 --> 02:42:47.991
NORMALLY USE AIR DRIVEN WHICH I

02:42:48.058 --> 02:42:50.127
DID RUN A COMPRESSOR. STAY IN

02:42:50.193 --> 02:42:51.495
THE HOSE OUT AND THEY'RE

02:42:51.561 --> 02:42:52.562
AWESOME THIS STUFF THE

02:42:52.629 --> 02:42:55.098
TECHNOLOGY IS REALLY AMAZING

02:42:55.165 --> 02:42:57.767
AND I GOT A POLL SAW- TO TRIM

02:42:57.834 --> 02:42:59.102
THE TREES ON THE WAY INTO MY

02:42:59.169 --> 02:43:00.937
FARM SO MANY CLIP IT DOESN'T.

02:43:01.004 --> 02:43:02.372
GET THE MAYOR'S TORN OFF OF IT

02:43:02.439 --> 02:43:05.509
AND- IT WORKS GREAT. BUT WHEN

02:43:05.575 --> 02:43:07.410
I'M OUT IN THE FIELD. AND I

02:43:07.477 --> 02:43:09.679
HAVE TO GO TWENTY MILES. EITHER

02:43:09.746 --> 02:43:11.581
WAY BACK AND FORTH TO THE RANCH.

02:43:11.648 --> 02:43:14.084
I HAVE AN INVERTER. IT'S A PLUG

02:43:14.151 --> 02:43:15.619
IN THE IT'S IN YOUR PICK UP

02:43:15.685 --> 02:43:16.887
RIGHT AND YOU CAN CHARGE YOUR

02:43:16.953 --> 02:43:18.421
BATTERY SO I HAVE TO START TO

02:43:18.488 --> 02:43:20.657
PICK UP OF MY BATTERY GOES BAD

02:43:20.724 --> 02:43:24.261
DAD TO. CHARGE MY IMPACT RICH

02:43:24.327 --> 02:43:26.163
SO I THINK THERE'S I THINK MORE

02:43:26.229 --> 02:43:27.531
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS A STICK

02:43:27.597 --> 02:43:29.366
WHY DON'T WE JUST INCENTIVIZE

02:43:29.432 --> 02:43:32.602
PEOPLE TO CONVERT OVER WHO MAKE

02:43:32.669 --> 02:43:33.803
CAN MAKE THAT CHOICE INSTEAD OF

02:43:33.870 --> 02:43:34.871
SAYING HEY YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE

02:43:34.938 --> 02:43:37.274
ABLE TO BUY THESE PRODUCTS IN

02:43:37.340 --> 02:43:40.410
CALIFORNIA IN TWO YEARS. PRICE

02:43:40.477 --> 02:43:40.911
TWENTY TWENTY TWO THAT I

02:43:40.977 --> 02:43:42.712
BELIEVE THAT THE FIRST PHASE

02:43:42.779 --> 02:43:44.381
NOT GENERATORS ARE OUT FURTHER

02:43:44.447 --> 02:43:46.216
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S THE

02:43:46.283 --> 02:43:47.150
PROBLEM WITH THE LEGISLATION

02:43:47.217 --> 02:43:48.552
FOR ME IS THAT WHERE

02:43:48.618 --> 02:43:49.586
ENFORCEMENT WE'RE ALLOWING

02:43:49.653 --> 02:43:51.321
THEIR BOARD WHICH BY THE WAY I

02:43:51.388 --> 02:43:52.889
SPOKE EARLIER ON AND OTHER BILL

02:43:52.956 --> 02:43:54.291
WE HAD A NEAR THE AIRPORT WE

02:43:54.357 --> 02:43:56.693
JUST CHANGE THE WHOLE BOARD.

02:43:56.760 --> 02:43:57.294
THE BEHIND IT WITH THE SENATE

02:43:57.360 --> 02:44:00.597
JUST APPROVED. NEW MEMBERS

02:44:00.664 --> 02:44:01.198
THEIR BOARD THAT'S BECAUSE THE

02:44:01.264 --> 02:44:04.000
LAST. LORD WAS A PERFORMING AT

02:44:04.067 --> 02:44:05.468
THE AT THE LEVEL WE WANTED TO

02:44:05.535 --> 02:44:07.504
LET TO PERFORM AND WE SEE THAT

02:44:07.571 --> 02:44:10.407
A LOT HERE WHEN THE- HIGH SPEED

02:44:10.473 --> 02:44:10.941
TRAIN DOESN'T WORK WE JUST

02:44:11.007 --> 02:44:13.210
REPLACE THE PERSON WHO'S IN

02:44:13.276 --> 02:44:14.377
CHARGE AND YOU KNOW THE LAST

02:44:14.444 --> 02:44:15.745
GUY WASN'T OUR LAST GROUP

02:44:15.812 --> 02:44:17.013
WASN'T. THE ONE THAT DID IT AND

02:44:17.080 --> 02:44:18.148
THEN WHEN THAT DOESN'T WORK WE

02:44:18.215 --> 02:44:19.482
JUST CONTINUE TO DO WHAT.

02:44:19.549 --> 02:44:20.784
GOVERNMENT DOES IS REPLACE IT

02:44:20.850 --> 02:44:22.485
AND BLAME IT ON THE- OTHER GUY

02:44:22.552 --> 02:44:24.354
THAT'S NOT HERE ANYMORE. AND I

02:44:24.421 --> 02:44:25.455
DON'T LIKE THAT PROCESS I'D

02:44:25.522 --> 02:44:26.756
ACTUALLY LIKE TO DO SOMETHING

02:44:26.823 --> 02:44:27.757
THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE FOR

02:44:27.824 --> 02:44:28.925
CALIFORNIANS AND GET A GOOD

02:44:28.992 --> 02:44:31.962
POLICY OUT. SO IN THIS PIECE OF

02:44:32.028 --> 02:44:33.863
LEGISLATION AS GONNA DEFINITELY

02:44:33.930 --> 02:44:35.332
IMPACT A LOT OF PEOPLE. GONNA

02:44:35.398 --> 02:44:38.268
IN IMPACT A- SMALL MINORITY

02:44:38.335 --> 02:44:39.736
LANDSCAPERS IT'S GOING TO

02:44:39.803 --> 02:44:42.005
IMPACT. I'M ALWAYS GLAD TO HEAR

02:44:42.072 --> 02:44:44.007

COOKED WELL I THINK THERE'S A

02:45:02.359 --> 02:45:03.460
LOT THINK I THINK THAT DATA

02:45:03.526 --> 02:45:06.196
NEEDS TO BE ONFIRMED NOT JUST

02:45:06.263 --> 02:45:07.664
A PHONE SURVEY THAT'S THAT'S-

02:45:07.731 --> 02:45:09.466
PRETTY GENERIC. WE NEED TO HAVE

02:45:09.532 --> 02:45:11.034
REAL RAW DATA AND THE

02:45:11.101 --> 02:45:12.502
OPPOSITION POINTED OUT THAT

02:45:12.569 --> 02:45:13.536

02:45:13.603 --> 02:45:15.038
SOME OF THE PHONE DATA AND-

02:45:15.105 --> 02:45:17.107
FOUND THAT. AT LEAST IN THEIR

02:45:17.173 --> 02:45:17.841
SIDE OF IT WASN'T AT THAT

02:45:17.907 --> 02:45:20.243
WASN'T. REPORTED ACCURATELY SO

02:45:20.310 --> 02:45:21.945

02:46:04.487 --> 02:46:05.722
FIRST POSSIBLE IMPLEMENTATION

02:46:05.789 --> 02:46:08.458
DATE WOULD BE JANUARY FIRST

02:46:08.525 --> 02:46:09.459
TWENTY TWENTY FOUR OR LATER

02:46:09.526 --> 02:46:10.827
DEPENDING ON ON CARDS-

02:46:10.894 --> 02:46:12.662
TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS

02:46:12.729 --> 02:46:14.130
AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY DECIDE.

02:46:14.197 --> 02:46:15.398
TO PUSH THAT BACK LATER LIKE

02:46:15.465 --> 02:46:16.733
THEY'VE ALREADY SAID THEY WILL

02:46:16.800 --> 02:46:18.101
FOR THE GENERATORS WHICH WILL

02:46:18.168 --> 02:46:20.103
BE TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. AT THE

02:46:20.170 --> 02:46:22.339
EARLIEST AND SO- YOU KNOW I'LL

JUST SAY I THINK THIS WILL HAVE

02:46:23.873 --> 02:46:25.175
A BIG IMPACT I THINK I HAVE A

02:46:25.241 --> 02:46:27.644
VERY POSITIVE IMPACT. ON ON THE

02:46:27.711 --> 02:46:29.546
PEOPLE WHO USE THE EQUIPMENT-

02:46:29.612 --> 02:46:31.247
WHO WERE YOU KNOW SUFFERING

02:46:31.314 --> 02:46:33.216
FROM THE NEGATIVE HEALTH.

02:46:33.283 --> 02:46:34.884
CONSEQUENCES THAT THAT CENTER

02:46:34.951 --> 02:46:36.686
STERN MENTIONED- AND THEN IT'LL

02:46:36.753 --> 02:46:38.221
HELP IT'LL HELP YOU KNOW ALL

02:46:38.288 --> 02:46:39.456
THE ENVIRONMENT AND HELP US

02:46:39.522 --> 02:46:40.757
REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

02:46:40.824 --> 02:46:43.360
AND SMOG. CREATING EMISSIONS-

02:46:43.426 --> 02:46:44.728
THAT THE CURRENT EQUIPMENT.

02:46:44.794 --> 02:46:46.896
CREATES AND SO- I UNDERSTAND

02:46:46.963 --> 02:46:48.231
THAT IT WILL BE A CHANGE IT'LL

02:46:48.298 --> 02:46:50.567
BE A GRADUAL CHANGE- BECAUSE

02:46:50.633 --> 02:46:52.669
PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO REPLACE

02:46:52.736 --> 02:46:54.070
EVERYTHING RIGHT AWAY THE CAN

02:46:54.137 --> 02:46:56.306
DO IT SLOWLY IS AS- INDIVIDUAL

02:46:56.373 --> 02:46:58.375
PIECES OF EQUIPMENT BREAKDOWN-

02:46:58.441 --> 02:47:00.176
BUT I THINK. THIS IS A FEATURE

02:47:00.243 --> 02:47:02.278
THAT WE ALL KNOW WE NEED TO GO-

02:47:02.345 --> 02:47:04.814
E. AND YEAH THIS IS JUST THE

02:47:04.881 --> 02:47:06.616
BILL REALLY JUST SAYS TO CARB.

02:47:06.683 --> 02:47:07.917
YOU HAVE TO CREATE THE

02:47:07.984 --> 02:47:09.285
REGULATIONS BY A CERTAIN DATE

02:47:09.352 --> 02:47:10.754
AND IT LEAVES IT UP TO CARVE TO

02:47:10.820 --> 02:47:12.489
DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT.

02:47:12.555 --> 02:47:13.123
TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IS THE RIGHT

02:47:13.189 --> 02:47:14.157
YEAR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IS THE

02:47:14.224 --> 02:47:15.225
RIGHT YEAR TWENTY TWENTY SIX IS

02:47:15.291 --> 02:47:16.726
THE RIGHT YEAR. YOU KNOW THE

02:47:16.793 --> 02:47:18.194
REGULATORS WILL THAT MAKE THAT

02:47:18.261 --> 02:47:20.096
MAKE THAT DETERMINATION- BUT I

02:47:20.163 --> 02:47:24.634
DO APPRECIATE THAT YOU KNOW.

02:47:24.701 --> 02:47:25.602
THIS IS A CHANGE AND- THE KNOW

02:47:25.668 --> 02:47:27.837
CHANGES ALL HARD. PERSEVERANCE

02:47:27.904 --> 02:47:31.808
SAY THAT. AT LEAST IN MY OFFICE

02:47:31.875 --> 02:47:33.109
I GET CALLS EVERY DAY ABOUT HOW

02:47:33.176 --> 02:47:35.078
WE SEE THE LEGISLATURE GAVE THE

02:47:35.145 --> 02:47:36.646
POWER TO SOME OTHER AGENCY THAT

02:47:36.713 --> 02:47:38.214
TOOK IT AWAY FROM THERE FROM

02:47:38.281 --> 02:47:40.417
THE LEGISLATORS AND THAT'S

02:47:40.483 --> 02:47:41.217
EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT

02:47:41.284 --> 02:47:43.286
GIVES POWER TO THEIR BOARD TO

02:47:43.353 --> 02:47:44.621
MAKE A DECISION THE SAME POWER

02:47:44.687 --> 02:47:45.622
WE GAVE TO THE PARMA TOXIC

02:47:45.688 --> 02:47:48.725
SUBSTANCE AND THE WATER BOARD

02:47:48.792 --> 02:47:49.893
AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE THAT DON'T

02:47:49.959 --> 02:47:51.027
DON'T HAVE TO STAND FOR

02:47:51.094 --> 02:47:52.495
ELECTION. ARE GETTING THE

02:47:52.562 --> 02:47:54.597
ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO MAKE LOS

02:47:54.664 --> 02:47:55.532
FURTHER OUT WE WON'T BE HERE

02:47:55.598 --> 02:47:56.933
WE'LL PROBABLY MORE LIKELY BE

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:58.868
TURNED OUT AND THEN THOSE LAWS

02:47:58.935 --> 02:48:00.136
ARE GOING TO FACT AND YOU KNOW

02:48:00.203 --> 02:48:01.871
THE HISTORY GETS LOST AND THEN

02:48:01.938 --> 02:48:04.874
WE END UP WITH. BUREAUCRATS

02:48:04.941 --> 02:48:07.277
MAKING LAWS. THAT REALLY WILL

02:48:07.343 --> 02:48:08.511
IMPACT OUR PEOPLE NOT ON GOOD

02:48:08.578 --> 02:48:10.113
COMMON SENSE OF. THOSE RESULT

TO GIVE SAYS SHAPE SOME SORT

02:52:39.148 --> 02:52:40.950
OF. COURSE HERE IN SAYING IN

AIRPORT TO MAKE WHEN THEY DO

02:52:55.631 --> 02:52:57.233
THESE REGULATIONS TO MAKE THOSE

02:52:57.300 --> 02:53:00.570
FUNDS AVAILABLE. TO COMMERCIAL.

02:53:00.636 --> 02:53:01.871
FOR COMMERCIAL REBATES AND THAT

02:53:01.938 --> 02:53:04.006
SORT OF BEEN SILENT HERE SO I

02:53:04.073 --> 02:53:06.242
KNOW. OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM LONG

02:53:06.309 --> 02:53:07.276
BEACH IS WORRIED ABOUT PEOPLE

THAT ARE IN THIS BUSINESS

02:53:08.478 --> 02:53:09.812
BECAUSE WE FOR WE'VE ALL HEARD

02:53:09.879 --> 02:53:13.816
FROM THE OPPOSITION ON THIS.

02:53:13.883 --> 02:53:14.884
BUT BUT- CORRECT ME IF I'M

02:53:14.951 --> 02:53:16.753
WRONG THAT THAT THAT THIS IS

02:53:16.819 --> 02:53:19.455
THIS IS SOME GUIDANCE HERE BUT

02:53:19.522 --> 02:53:20.957
THIS IS THIS TRAINS LEFT THE

02:53:21.023 --> 02:53:22.825
STATION ALREADY AT THE AIRPORT

02:53:22.892 --> 02:53:24.160
AND THEY'RE GOING YOU JUST WANT

02:53:24.227 --> 02:53:25.895
TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE GOT WE

02:53:25.962 --> 02:53:27.296
GOT THE RIGS ARE ON THIS STATE

02:53:27.363 --> 02:53:28.531
CERTAIN AND THIS COULD TAKE

02:53:28.598 --> 02:53:30.500
EFFECT ON THE STATE'S CERTAIN.

02:53:30.566 --> 02:53:31.534
THAT'S RIGHT AND THEN YOUR

02:53:31.601 --> 02:53:33.970
POINT ABOUT ABOUT HE DIED

02:53:34.036 --> 02:53:39.876
DROWNING GUIDANCE TO CARBON.

02:53:39.942 --> 02:53:42.445
TYPES OF EQUIPMENT- THAT PEOPLE

02:53:42.512 --> 02:53:44.947
CAN GET REBATES OR INCENTIVES

02:53:45.014 --> 02:53:46.916
FUNDING FOR IS LIKE YOU SAID

02:53:46.983 --> 02:53:48.217
KIND OF THE QUIET BUT VERY

02:53:48.284 --> 02:53:49.919
IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE BILL

02:53:49.986 --> 02:53:52.755
SO THAT MORE- COMMERCIAL-

02:53:52.822 --> 02:53:54.257
LANDSCAPING COMPANIES CAN

02:53:54.323 --> 02:53:56.392
QUALIFY. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW AND

02:53:56.459 --> 02:53:57.827
CAN QUALIFY FOR MORE A BROADER

02:53:57.894 --> 02:53:59.295
RANGE OF EQUIPMENT- BECAUSE

02:53:59.362 --> 02:54:00.363
RIGHT NOW IT'S VERY NARROW ON

02:54:00.429 --> 02:54:01.497
THE COMMERCIAL SIDE ITS BROADER

02:54:01.564 --> 02:54:02.899
ON THE RESIDENTIAL SIDE. AND

02:54:02.965 --> 02:54:05.201
THAT'S WHY A LOT OF- EQUALITY

02:54:05.268 --> 02:54:07.003
DISTRICTS UTILIZE RESIDENTIAL

02:54:07.069 --> 02:54:08.437
REBATES BUT NOT SO MUCH

02:54:08.504 --> 02:54:10.506
COMMERCIAL AND I THINK. WE NEED

02:54:10.573 --> 02:54:12.608
TO FOCUS MORE ON THE

02:54:12.675 --> 02:54:16.979
COMMERCIAL. TO BE HONEST. YEAH.
