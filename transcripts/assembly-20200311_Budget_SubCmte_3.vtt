STEP OF THE EIGHT TO TESTIFY

00:30:17.882 --> 00:30:22.820
BOB THIS IS AN ISSUE ENTER THE

00:30:22.887 --> 00:30:24.322
PEOPLE NOT BEING ABLE TO COME

I'M HOPING- THAT WE ARE GOING

TO BE ABLE TO MAKE CHANGES IN

00:30:35.533 --> 00:30:37.468
OUR- CITIES. WILL ALLOW FOR

00:30:37.535 --> 00:30:39.637
REMOTE. THINGS LIKE THAT- TO

LEGISLATIVE FOR A CYCLE. OF THE-

00:30:51.649 --> 00:30:52.684
LOOK WE'RE GONNA BEGIN OF THIS

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:57.255
DISCUSSION WITH- LA SO REPORT.

00:30:57.322 --> 00:30:59.290
GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING AND

SPEAKING FROM THE HAND THAT

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:08.399
THAT WAS HANDED OUT TO YOU AND

00:31:08.466 --> 00:31:10.668
THAT'S HOW THEY WILL ALSO BE

00:31:10.735 --> 00:31:12.804
AVAILABLE ON THEIR WEB SITE. M.

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:16.274
L. COMMITTEE STAFF AT BEST TO

00:31:16.341 --> 00:31:18.776
PRESENT- A COUPLE OF BACKGROUND

00:31:18.843 --> 00:31:22.413
PIECES ON TRANSIT. FIRST ON AND

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:23.648
THE ROLE TRANSIT HAS AN

00:31:23.715 --> 00:31:25.583
REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:27.785
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS- AS

00:31:27.852 --> 00:31:29.821
WELL AS SOME BACKGROUND ON IN

00:31:29.887 --> 00:31:31.723
STATE FUNDING OF TRANSIT

00:31:31.789 --> 00:31:34.926
SERVICES IN THE STATE. SO IF

00:31:34.993 --> 00:31:38.863
YOU TURN AGE WINE. THE

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:42.200
TRANSPORTATION IS THE LARGEST

00:31:42.267 --> 00:31:43.468
SOURCE OF GREENHOUSE GAS

00:31:43.534 --> 00:31:45.336
EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA AND

00:31:45.403 --> 00:31:47.205
THEIR RESEARCH BOARD ESTIMATES

00:31:47.272 --> 00:31:50.308
ABOUT 39% OF GHG EMISSIONS

00:31:50.375 --> 00:31:51.442
COMES FROM THE TRAIN STATION

00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:54.912
SECTOR AND A LARGE CHUNK OF

00:31:54.979 --> 00:31:56.981
THAT COMES FROM ON RESOURCES

00:31:57.048 --> 00:31:59.917
INCLUDING PASSENGER VEHICLES

00:31:59.984 --> 00:32:02.253
AND TRUCKS BUSES. AND THE

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.722
REMAINING PORTION OF THE AT

00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:05.857
EMISSIONS FROM THE

00:32:05.923 --> 00:32:07.492
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR COMES

00:32:07.558 --> 00:32:10.528
FROM THINGS THAT L. I. SHIPS

00:32:10.595 --> 00:32:12.864
AND PLANES BUT THE MAJORITY

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:16.734
TRUMP I'M SORRY SAYS. AT THAT'S

00:32:16.801 --> 00:32:17.935
THE- A LOT OF ATTENTION AND

00:32:18.002 --> 00:32:21.406
PAID. AND HOW THE C. CAN EDUCE

00:32:21.472 --> 00:32:22.807
GHG EMISSIONS FROM THE

00:32:22.874 --> 00:32:25.009
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR AND ONE

00:32:25.076 --> 00:32:29.013
POTENTIAL STRATEGY IS TO. SHIFT

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:30.381
THE NUMBER OF FOLKS THAT ARE

00:32:30.448 --> 00:32:33.751
DRIVING PRIVATE VEHICLES TO AB

00:32:33.818 --> 00:32:35.720
MORE EFFICIENT MODES OF TRANSIT

00:32:35.787 --> 00:32:38.423
I'M MODES OF TRANSPORTATION

00:32:38.489 --> 00:32:42.960
INCLUDING TRANSIT. AND SO I AND

00:32:43.027 --> 00:32:48.533
PAGE TWO YOU CAN SEE THAT

00:32:48.599 --> 00:32:52.170
TRANSIT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO

00:32:52.236 --> 00:32:54.038
SAM CONGESTION AND FUEL

00:32:54.105 --> 00:32:58.643
EFFICIENT AS A RESULT- PRODUCE

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:00.511
LESS GHG EMISSIONS THAN PRIVATE.

00:33:00.578 --> 00:33:02.747
VEHICLES SO VARIOUS TYPES OF

00:33:02.814 --> 00:33:05.149
TRANSIT HAVE BEEN ESTIMATED ON

00:33:05.216 --> 00:33:07.251
AVERAGE TO ESTIMATE TO EMIT

00:33:07.318 --> 00:33:10.621
LESS A MISSION STAND A SINGLE

00:33:10.688 --> 00:33:12.724
OCCUPANCY VEHICLES SO FOLKS

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:15.827
DRIVING ALONE IN THEIR CARS.

00:33:15.893 --> 00:33:18.429
BUT OF COURSE THE EFFICIENCY OF

00:33:18.496 --> 00:33:19.630
THESE MODES ARE REALLY DEPEND

00:33:19.697 --> 00:33:21.733
ON TWO CRITICAL FACTORS

00:33:21.799 --> 00:33:26.237
OCCUPANCY- AS WELL AS ENERGY SO

00:33:26.304 --> 00:33:28.773
OF COURSE THE MORE FOLKS THAT

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.508
ARE WRITING UP I STILL LOWER

00:33:30.575 --> 00:33:33.745
MISSION IS PER PASSED MILE. SEC

00:33:33.811 --> 00:33:35.847
I AM SAID THAT ENERGY IS ALSO A

00:33:35.913 --> 00:33:39.083
KEY FACTOR IN DIET AT. HYBRID

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:41.252
BIAS WOULD PRODUCE LESS

00:33:41.319 --> 00:33:43.087
EMISSIONS PER MILE PER FIRST

00:33:43.154 --> 00:33:49.060
SAYS AB. I DIESEL FUEL BUS. HI

00:33:49.127 --> 00:33:50.962
AND SO I'M MOVING ON TO KIND OF

00:33:51.028 --> 00:33:53.364
THE SECOND PORTION OF THAT THE

00:33:53.431 --> 00:33:56.401
BACKGROUND ON TRANSIT- THE

00:33:56.467 --> 00:33:59.470
FUNDING SO TRANSIT IS FUNDED

00:33:59.537 --> 00:34:01.873
THROUGH A VARIETY OF SOURCES-

00:34:01.939 --> 00:34:04.842
BUT NEARLY HALF OF THE STORE

00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:07.512
SAYS ARE COME FROM LOW. LOCAL

00:34:07.578 --> 00:34:11.616
TAX REVENUE. I'M IN TWENTY

00:34:11.682 --> 00:34:15.253
EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE

00:34:15.319 --> 00:34:17.121
TWELVE BILLION I'M WAS BUDGETED.

00:34:17.188 --> 00:34:18.890
AND WAS SPENT FOR TRANSDUCER

00:34:18.956 --> 00:34:21.292
PROCESS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN- AND

00:34:21.359 --> 00:34:23.361
BUT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS

00:34:23.428 --> 00:34:25.930
PRESENTATION OF FOCUSED- FIND

00:34:25.997 --> 00:34:28.099
KIND OF THE STATE PROGRAMS FOR

00:34:28.166 --> 00:34:33.704
TRANSIT. I'M FIND PAGE FOUR- WE

00:34:33.771 --> 00:34:38.276
CAN SEE THAT IN MORE DETAIL

00:34:38.342 --> 00:34:40.244
SAID DIFFERENT STATE FUNDING

00:34:40.311 --> 00:34:43.815
PROGRAMS. FOR TRANSIT SERVICES

00:34:43.881 --> 00:34:46.717
AS THE FIGURE ON PAGE FOUR AND

00:34:46.784 --> 00:34:48.853
SHOWS THE MAJOR SOURCES- THE

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:52.857
STATE LEVEL THAT FUND TRANSIT

00:34:52.924 --> 00:34:56.060
THIS TRANSIT STANDS AT EXCEPT.

00:34:56.127 --> 00:35:00.131
THE MAJORITY I'M- IT'S FUNDED

00:35:00.198 --> 00:35:01.599
BY THE STATE SALES TAX ON

00:35:01.666 --> 00:35:03.868
DIESEL TIME AND IT'S ALLOCATED

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.168
DONE IT DIDN'T AND HOW WE CAN

00:36:44.235 --> 00:36:44.902
REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF

00:36:44.969 --> 00:36:46.470
INVESTMENT IN SUBSIDY OF PUBLIC

00:36:46.537 --> 00:36:48.539
TRANSIT IN ORDER TO GET BOTH

00:36:48.606 --> 00:36:49.774
MOBILITY BENEFITS AND

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:50.942
ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS FROM

00:36:51.008 --> 00:36:52.176
THAT INVESTED ACTUALLY COMMENT

00:36:52.243 --> 00:36:54.612
ON A COUPLE OF POLICY PROPOSED.

00:36:54.679 --> 00:37:00.685
TALKED THAT WE ARE INTO THE OF

00:37:00.751 --> 00:37:05.890
BILLS IF THE VERY LARGE OF

00:37:05.957 --> 00:37:11.028
REPORTS

00:37:11.095 --> 00:37:12.730
TRANSIT RIDERSHIP IS ERODING IN

00:37:12.797 --> 00:37:14.231
CALIFORNIA AND- AND AROUND THE

00:37:14.298 --> 00:37:15.032
COUNTRY THIS CONCERNED ABOUT

00:37:15.099 --> 00:37:16.067
THAT BUT TO KEEP IT IN THE BIG

00:37:16.133 --> 00:37:18.469
PICTURE IS WELL IT'S DOWN IN

00:37:18.536 --> 00:37:20.204
ABSOLUTE TERMS IT'S RELATIVELY

00:37:20.271 --> 00:37:22.340
MODEST SO THE DECLINES- ARE NOT

00:37:22.406 --> 00:37:23.975
ENORMOUS BUT IT'S A LITTLE

00:37:24.041 --> 00:37:25.843
ALARMING THEY'RE GOING IN THE

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:26.410
DIRECTION THEY'VE BEEN GOING

00:37:26.477 --> 00:37:27.044
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE LAST FEW

00:37:27.111 --> 00:37:30.514
YEARS WE'VE BEEN ECONOMIC UPS

00:37:30.581 --> 00:37:33.184
THOSE. GO TO OTHER OF. WHAT'S

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:34.552
MORE CONCERNING. IS NOT THE TOP

00:37:34.619 --> 00:37:36.354
LINE NUMBERS BUT THE WRITERS

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:37.788
PER CAPITA OR THE TRIPS PER

00:37:37.855 --> 00:37:39.523
PERSON. BECAUSE CITIES IN

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:41.125
CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN GROWING.

00:37:41.192 --> 00:37:42.493
AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:43.761
SINCE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND EIGHT

00:37:43.828 --> 00:37:45.196
OF THE START OF THE RECEPTION.

00:37:45.262 --> 00:37:47.398
WE HAD A DECLINE IN PER CAPITA

00:37:47.465 --> 00:37:50.334
RIDERSHIP- ACROSS THE US. IN

00:37:50.401 --> 00:37:51.268
CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY IN

00:37:51.335 --> 00:37:53.004
GREATER LOS ANGELES. THAT

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:54.805
WASN'T NECESSARY A SURPRISE

00:37:54.872 --> 00:37:55.740
DURING SEVERE ECONOMIC

00:37:55.806 --> 00:37:59.110
DOWNTURN. THINGS DID TO IMPROVE

00:37:59.176 --> 00:38:01.646
COMING OUT OF THE RECESSION.

00:38:01.712 --> 00:38:02.680
BUT THEN WHAT'S- IT'S ABOUT

00:38:02.747 --> 00:38:05.082
FORTY. IS THAT. CAPITAL SHIP IS

00:38:05.149 --> 00:38:07.418
BEEN GOING DOWN AGAIN. BUT

00:38:07.485 --> 00:38:08.953
SIXTEEN THEY WERE THEM BECAUSE-

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:11.155
AGAIN ECONOMIC AND WOULD

00:38:11.222 --> 00:38:15.259
PROTECT. OUR SHIP THESE. THE

00:38:15.326 --> 00:38:18.829
MOTHER. ROCHE BASRA ACROSS THE

00:38:18.896 --> 00:38:20.431
OF A RAY RIDERS REBEL OUT OF

00:38:20.498 --> 00:38:22.833
THE WRIST BUT IT TO HIS STARTED

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:26.003
DOWN AS WELL SO WE HAVE WE HAVE

00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:28.005
TWO MAJOR TRANSIT ROAD

00:38:28.072 --> 00:38:28.773
STATEWIDE THAT ALSO TING

00:38:28.839 --> 00:38:31.609
RAPPERS ADDED AND THAT WILL

00:38:31.676 --> 00:38:33.411
BRING A LOT MORE. ON ONE THING

00:38:33.477 --> 00:38:34.812
I WANT TO SAY ABOUT THIS IT'S

00:38:34.879 --> 00:38:37.048
IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND IS THAT IT

00:38:37.114 --> 00:38:38.049
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IS

00:38:38.115 --> 00:38:39.617
ENORMOUSLY ASYMMETRIC ITS

00:38:39.684 --> 00:38:41.652
ASYMMETRIC SPACE ASYMMETRIC

00:38:41.719 --> 00:38:43.487
TEMPORARY TEMPORALLY IT JUST

00:38:43.554 --> 00:38:45.156
DOESN'T SEVEN EVENLY

00:38:45.222 --> 00:38:48.526
DISTRIBUTED SO FIRST THING NO

00:38:48.592 --> 00:38:54.565
IS IT A FEW PEOPLE MAKE MOST OF

00:38:54.632 --> 00:38:55.800
THE TRANSIT. SEC IF YOU NAME

00:38:55.866 --> 00:38:57.768
CITIES. THE TRAIN TRIP. HEARD

00:38:57.835 --> 00:39:00.571
IS THAT A FEW ARE I AND THOSE

00:39:00.638 --> 00:39:02.006
OPERATORS CARE MOST OF THE

00:39:02.073 --> 00:39:05.876
PASSAGE. SO IT'S EXTREME UNEVEN

00:39:05.943 --> 00:39:06.577
WITH TO THE NOT PORTION OF

00:39:06.644 --> 00:39:08.245
ELATION SO JUST COUPLE OF THE

00:39:08.312 --> 00:39:11.582
EMINENT IT PULLS A IT IS AB.

00:39:11.649 --> 00:39:13.617
THERE ARE TWO MARKET PUBLIC

00:39:13.684 --> 00:39:15.352
TRANSIT PLACES THAT ARE HIGHLY

00:39:15.419 --> 00:39:16.554
AGGLOMERATED WHERE IT'S

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:19.090
DIFFICULT TO DRIVE AND PARK. IN

00:39:19.156 --> 00:39:20.791
THE SECOND ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

00:39:20.858 --> 00:39:24.729
LIVED ACCESS TO BILLS THOSE THE

00:39:24.795 --> 00:39:25.362
TWO KEY MARKETS AND LET ME JUST

00:39:25.429 --> 00:39:27.098
GIVE YOU A- COUPLE OF. AND THAT.

00:39:27.164 --> 00:39:28.332
THIS POPULATION DENSITIES IN

00:39:28.399 --> 00:39:29.700
AND HAVE AS PEOPLE PER MILE

00:39:29.767 --> 00:39:31.736
WHICH ARE THERE PLACES IN LOS

00:39:31.802 --> 00:39:32.970
ANGELES IN THE BAY AREA THERE

00:39:33.037 --> 00:39:36.040
LIKE THAT IF WE LOOK STATION

00:39:36.107 --> 00:39:39.243
WIDE ONLY 30% OF THE US

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:42.446
POPULATION LIVES IN PLACE AS

00:39:42.513 --> 00:39:42.980
WITH OVER TEN THAT PEOPLE

00:39:43.047 --> 00:39:46.584
SQUARE MILE. BUT OF ALL. PLACE

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:50.654
IS ABOUT. SIX OUT OF TEN. ICAL

00:39:50.721 --> 00:39:51.989
HOUSEHOLD ACTUALLY BEEN TO COME

00:39:52.056 --> 00:39:53.090
A LITTLE BIT STATE IN AND

00:39:53.157 --> 00:39:54.391
ACROSS THE- ABOUT 5% OF ALL

00:39:54.458 --> 00:39:56.761
HOUSEHOLDS DON'T HAVE A VEHICLE

00:39:56.827 --> 00:39:58.729
IN THEM OKAY. THE POST

00:39:58.796 --> 00:40:00.765
HOUSEHOLDS ACCOUNT FOR ALMOST

00:40:00.831 --> 00:40:01.799
HALF OF ALL THE TRANSIT IN THE

00:40:01.866 --> 00:40:03.467
IN THE COUNTRY ALMOST HALF IN

00:40:03.534 --> 00:40:06.137
CALIFORNIA. ENORMOUS A CEMETERY

00:40:06.203 --> 00:40:07.238
A FEW OF THOSE HOUSEHOLDS

00:40:07.304 --> 00:40:08.606
MAKING A LARGE NUMBER TRIPS IN

00:40:08.672 --> 00:40:10.441
A FEW NEIGHBORHOODS ARE

00:40:10.508 --> 00:40:11.675
CARRYING MOST OF THE STRIPS. SO

00:40:11.742 --> 00:40:14.812
IN LA. A DATA WE DID AND I KNOW

00:40:14.879 --> 00:40:16.313
COATED HIS DANCING SLIGHTLY

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:17.515
DIFFERENT THIS IS THE WHOLE

00:40:17.581 --> 00:40:19.216
REGION WE LOOK AT THE WHOLE AG

00:40:19.283 --> 00:40:22.419
READ. ABOUT TO SET ALL OF THE

00:40:22.486 --> 00:40:25.055
PEOPLE IN THE SCARE AN AVERAGE

00:40:25.122 --> 00:40:28.559
ABOUT FIVE TRIP ON. I ABOUT BUT

00:40:28.626 --> 00:40:30.828
TWELVE TRIP SEBRING'S IT UP

00:40:30.895 --> 00:40:32.596
222% OF THE POPULATION BUT

00:40:32.663 --> 00:40:34.965
ABOUT 78% OF THE POPULATION

00:40:35.032 --> 00:40:37.101
RIDE THE FEWER THE TRIP A MONTH

00:40:37.168 --> 00:40:38.536
THERE ARE MOST OF THAT AT ALL

00:40:38.602 --> 00:40:41.839
AND SO IT MEANS IS THING HAVE

00:40:41.906 --> 00:40:43.140
TO THAT POPULAR VERY HAVE

00:40:43.207 --> 00:40:46.677
TRADING USE IT HAS OUT. FOR OUR-

00:40:46.744 --> 00:40:48.112
THE A LITTLE BIT THE POPPY CAN

00:40:48.179 --> 00:40:50.347
HAVE A- AND THAT'S WHAT WE SAW

00:40:50.414 --> 00:40:52.883
SO FOR EXAMPLE WE CALCULATED

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:55.653
FROM TWO THOUSAND TEN TO TWO

00:40:55.719 --> 00:40:56.520
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. OF THE LA

00:40:56.587 --> 00:40:59.523
MATCH AND IT 472% OF ALL OF THE

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:01.358
STATE'S RIDERSHIP LOSSES IN A

00:41:01.425 --> 00:41:03.427
PART OF THAT BECAUSE IT HAD

00:41:03.494 --> 00:41:06.263
SOME OF THE MOST HELP. NICE LOT.

00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:07.031
AS IT HAD OF ARJUNA PEOPLE VERY

00:41:07.097 --> 00:41:10.534
FREQUENT RIDE. IN THE BAY AREA

00:41:10.601 --> 00:41:13.737
OF WE HAD SORT OF HEARTENING

00:41:13.804 --> 00:41:15.840
COUNTER CYCLICAL TRENDS WITH

00:41:15.906 --> 00:41:16.607
THE BAY AREA ACTUALLY UNTIL

00:41:16.674 --> 00:41:19.176
THREE YEARS AGO WITH WAS DOING

00:41:19.243 --> 00:41:21.912
TO ADD RIDERS BUT ALMOST ALL OF

00:41:21.979 --> 00:41:23.814
THOSE WERE RUN TRANSBAY BART

00:41:23.881 --> 00:41:27.718
TRIPS THE RIVER THE REGION MUCH

00:41:27.785 --> 00:41:29.253
LIKE THE REST OF THIS WHICH IS.

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:32.189
THE ROAD. THIS IS WHAT IT WHICH

00:41:32.256 --> 00:41:34.892
IS A SAM CISCO CB. WITH HIS

00:41:34.959 --> 00:41:35.459
SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN

00:41:35.526 --> 00:41:37.094
EMPLOYMENT WAS KIND OF CARRYING

00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:39.363
THE WHOLE STATE ALONG WITH WITH

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:40.898
RIDERSHIP INCREASES. WHAT ARE

00:41:40.965 --> 00:41:42.933
SOME O THE REASONS BEHIND THIS

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.035
IS. WE HAVE CHANGES IN THE

00:41:45.102 --> 00:41:46.737
ENVIRONMENTS WITH WHICH TRANSIT

00:41:46.804 --> 00:41:48.606
CAN OPERATE SO THESE OF THESE

00:41:48.672 --> 00:41:50.741
THESE DENSE HIGHLY A LOT RATED

00:41:50.808 --> 00:41:51.909
PLACES. OTHER IS CHANGES TO

00:41:51.976 --> 00:41:54.712
ACCESS TO OTHER MODES OF THOSE

00:41:54.778 --> 00:41:55.980
WE THINK ARE THE OTHER THINGS

00:41:56.046 --> 00:41:57.715
THAT ARE MADE BEHIND IT.

00:41:57.781 --> 00:42:00.251
OUTSIDE OF THE- YEAH. THE

00:42:00.317 --> 00:42:01.719
BIGGEST STORY SINCE TWO

00:42:01.785 --> 00:42:02.553
THOUSAND AND REALLY IN THE TWO

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:04.321
THOUSANDS HANDS. IS WE'VE SEEN

00:42:04.388 --> 00:42:06.523
INCREASING AUTO ACCESS AMONG

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:09.226
LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS

00:42:09.293 --> 00:42:10.427
GENERALLY HI I'M HOUSE OF ALL

00:42:10.494 --> 00:42:11.562
HOUSEHOLDS HAVE BEEN INCREASED

00:42:11.629 --> 00:42:15.299
AUTO A- BUT IT'S BEEN. LONG

00:42:15.366 --> 00:42:17.701
DOES THE RIVER HELLO. OTTO SAYS

00:42:17.768 --> 00:42:20.004
OUT OF. YES THAT MEANS. IT IS.

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:20.671
REDUCTION AND VEHICLE

00:42:20.738 --> 00:42:22.673
HOUSEHOLDS STATE. REMEMBER I

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:25.843
TOLD YOU THAT 5% CARRIED ALMOST

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:31.916
HALF THE RIGHT. LOOTING HERE

00:42:31.982 --> 00:42:33.150
ZERO. BE GOOD HOUSE OVERALL

00:42:33.217 --> 00:42:34.585
ABILITY BUT IN TERMS OF THE

00:42:34.652 --> 00:42:35.119
SHIP IS QUITE DE BE THOSE

00:42:35.185 --> 00:42:36.453
PEOPLE ARE WRITING SO FREE AT

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.789
BAY AREA INTERESTINGLY HAS NOT

00:42:38.856 --> 00:42:41.058
HAD THAT THAT A CHANGE IN

00:42:41.125 --> 00:42:44.061
VI&lt;c.cyan&gt; EXCESSIVE TALK LATER WE&lt;/c&gt;

00:42:44.128 --> 00:42:45.229
DID. STE IS THE MALL THAT

00:42:45.296 --> 00:42:46.030
ESTIMATED ALL ALL OF THE

00:42:46.096 --> 00:42:48.165
TRANSIT RIDERSHIP LOSSES WE'VE

00:42:48.232 --> 00:42:50.801
SEEN IN THE TWO THOUSANDS. IT

00:42:50.868 --> 00:42:51.502
CAN BE EXPLAINED LARGE BY

00:42:51.568 --> 00:42:52.603
INCREASE IN AUTO ACCESS IN

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:56.540
PLACES OUTSIDE AREA- AND IN

00:42:56.607 --> 00:42:58.142
THAT THIS IS DETAILED IN THE

00:42:58.208 --> 00:43:02.913
REPORTS THAT WE'VE DONE. AND

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:06.984
JUST FINISHED. REPORTER FOR THE-

00:43:07.051 --> 00:43:09.453
THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:10.287
IN THE DISTANCE BETWEEN JOBS

00:43:10.354 --> 00:43:12.056
AND HOUSING IN THE REGION AND

00:43:12.122 --> 00:43:13.290
WE SUSPECT THAT THAT'S REAL

00:43:13.357 --> 00:43:14.258
RELATED TO THE AFFORDABLE

00:43:14.325 --> 00:43:16.193
HOUSING CRISIS. SO WE'RE-

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:17.661
THINKING IN THE BACK AS WELL S

00:43:17.728 --> 00:43:19.229
THAT WE'RE SEEING MORE AFFLUENT

00:43:19.296 --> 00:43:22.066
COMMUTERS COMMUTING INTO JOB

00:43:22.132 --> 00:43:24.234
CENTERS. BUT AROUND THE REST OF

00:43:24.301 --> 00:43:26.337
THE STATE STAYING. OFF PEAK

00:43:26.403 --> 00:43:27.972
TIES IN SUBURBAN SYSTEMS ALL

00:43:28.038 --> 00:43:29.907
OF THOSE SYSTEMS AND AS- ABOUT

00:43:29.974 --> 00:43:30.507
THIS IS THAT THERE'S ONE

00:43:30.574 --> 00:43:32.209
MARKET. GOING IN AND OUT OF

00:43:32.276 --> 00:43:34.478
DOWNTOWN SERVICES GOING TO THE

00:43:34.545 --> 00:43:35.179
BIG JOB CENTER TO SORT OF

00:43:35.245 --> 00:43:38.048
HOLDING UP IN THE BAY AREA. BUT

00:43:38.115 --> 00:43:39.483
TO THE BAY AREA ALSO LOSE IT

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:42.619
DOES OFF PEAK THE MIDDAY

00:43:42.686 --> 00:43:45.222
EVENING. IS OUT IN BURBS ALL

00:43:45.289 --> 00:43:48.926
THOSE IS GOING. WE THE- HALE

00:43:48.993 --> 00:43:51.795
HIS HAVING DONE THE WAY RIGHT

00:43:51.862 --> 00:43:53.731
HAS MARKET IS TO BE PEOPLE

00:43:53.797 --> 00:43:54.865
TRAVELING TO AND WORK AN UNDER

00:43:54.932 --> 00:43:59.370
BASIS BUT IT MIGHT BE A MAKE

00:43:59.436 --> 00:44:03.507
AROUND DURING THE DAY OR AND

00:44:03.574 --> 00:44:06.443
SAT EVEN. GOING TO THE AIRPORT.

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:09.013
CASE SO PART OF THAT. IN AN

00:44:09.079 --> 00:44:10.781
RIDERSHIP IT OTHER TIMES BEEN

00:44:10.848 --> 00:44:12.449
LIKELY AFFECTED BY RIGHT HILL

00:44:12.516 --> 00:44:16.053
AS WELL WHAT ARE SOME OF THE

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:17.054
POLICY IMPLICATIONS JUST TO

00:44:17.121 --> 00:44:19.690
WRAP UP AB. WE'RE SEEING FEWER

00:44:19.757 --> 00:44:22.259
REDUCE TRANSIT DEPENDENTS OVER

00:44:22.326 --> 00:44:24.161
TIME IT OR CHOICE WRITERS WITH

00:44:24.228 --> 00:44:25.295
ACCESS TO CARS IN THIS IS

00:44:25.362 --> 00:44:28.832
PARTICULARLY THE CASE IN THE

00:44:28.899 --> 00:44:29.867
SENSE IS THE BAY AREA. NOW IF

00:44:29.933 --> 00:44:33.270
YOU'RE JUST LOSE. STRATEGIES TO

00:44:33.337 --> 00:44:34.238
GET OCCASIONAL RIDERS TO RIDE

00:44:34.304 --> 00:44:36.707
MORE AND TO GET PEOPLE WHO NOW

00:44:36.774 --> 00:44:37.808
NEVER RIGHT TO WRITE

00:44:37.875 --> 00:44:40.077
OCCASIONALLY AND- EFFORTS TO DO

00:44:40.144 --> 00:44:45.249
THAT ARE REALLY LIKELY TO BE.

00:44:45.315 --> 00:44:47.151
HAVE MORE AUTO OWNERSHIP IN IN

00:44:47.217 --> 00:44:50.154
AND FOR EXAMPLE LOWER INCOME

00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:52.890
HOUSEHOLDS THERE OFTEN VEHICLE

00:44:52.956 --> 00:44:54.925
DEFICIT HOUSE WHICH IS. A CAR A

00:44:54.992 --> 00:44:57.494
LICENSED DRIVER. CAN HOUSEHOLD

00:44:57.561 --> 00:44:58.362
WHERE THERE MIGHT BE THREE

00:44:58.429 --> 00:44:59.797
LICENSE DRIVER IN ONE CAR SO

00:44:59.863 --> 00:45:01.799
THERE'S STILL TRANSIT USE THEIR

00:45:01.865 --> 00:45:02.900
IN DOING MORE TO THOSE

00:45:02.966 --> 00:45:05.402
PASSENGERS A WRITER'S IS IT IS

00:45:05.469 --> 00:45:09.139
WELL A SECOND. AREA IS THAT WE

00:45:09.206 --> 00:45:10.941
SIMPLY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT

00:45:11.008 --> 00:45:12.943
CONFRONTING MANAGE PRIVATE

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:14.178
VEHICLE TRAVEL. AND IF THEY'RE

00:45:14.244 --> 00:45:17.014
IF HEAVY RAIL HAS A THIRD RAIL

00:45:17.081 --> 00:45:17.981
IF THERE'S A THIRD RAIL IN POP

00:45:18.048 --> 00:45:20.184
IS TRYING TO MANAGE THAT ICAL

00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:22.953
TRAVEL. BUT WE HAVE WE HAVE

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:26.123
SCARES THE NEXT. WORKING MORE

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:27.991
PEOPLE. ARE IT. IS HAVE A

00:45:28.058 --> 00:45:28.959
POSITIVE. THE ENVIRONMENT ON

00:45:29.026 --> 00:45:31.428
CAN ALL IN SLOW DOWN TRANS. AND

00:45:31.495 --> 00:45:32.029
WE CAN READ HER HANDS AROUND

00:45:32.096 --> 00:45:33.864
THAT. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THE

00:45:33.931 --> 00:45:36.834
TRANSIT TRANSIT. CAN TINKER IN

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:40.804
THIS WAY BUT- HAND. AT NOT LET

00:45:40.871 --> 00:45:43.974
HAVE MUCH OF. YOU CAN SEE. IF I

00:45:44.041 --> 00:45:46.176
WAYS PETER THE ROAD HOW. WE

00:45:46.243 --> 00:45:48.779
DRIVE PARKING BETTER BUT RIGHT.

00:45:48.846 --> 00:45:49.980
IT PEOPLE OFTEN MISSES THE

00:45:50.047 --> 00:45:51.381
ACTUALLY MAKE IT A BETTER

00:45:51.448 --> 00:45:53.083
RIDING BUT PEOPLE ARE MUCH MORE

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:56.453
JUDICIOUS THEIR USE OF THAT. I

00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:57.454
THREE BECOMES A MUCH MORE TO OF

00:45:57.521 --> 00:45:59.823
IT EVEN HAS BEEN FIRED IT'S

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:00.824
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT RURAL

00:46:00.891 --> 00:46:04.962
AREA BUT IN IN CAN. AREA NOW.

00:46:05.028 --> 00:46:08.232
IT IS IT IS EFFECTIVE. I WILL

00:46:08.298 --> 00:46:09.867
TURN OF ANY PART BECAUSE IT

00:46:09.933 --> 00:46:11.401
MOVES TO ME. PLEA THREE STREETS

00:46:11.468 --> 00:46:15.806
WITH THAT IN LONDON. IN IN A

00:46:15.873 --> 00:46:18.942
THIS THERE CAN JUST PRICING TO.

00:46:19.009 --> 00:46:19.576
PAY FOR THE LONDON UNDERGROUND

00:46:19.643 --> 00:46:20.644
UPGRADES I NEXT BENEFIT WAS A

00:46:20.711 --> 00:46:21.912
HUGE INCREASE IN BUS WRITER

00:46:21.979 --> 00:46:24.781
BECAUSE NOW LET'S MOVING AROUND

00:46:24.848 --> 00:46:27.217
SO MUCH WORK. SEC THAT'S SORT

00:46:27.284 --> 00:46:29.987
OF PERVERT THIS. TRANSIT WHICH

00:46:30.053 --> 00:46:31.155
IS A YOU KNOW IT A POLICY

00:46:31.221 --> 00:46:33.323
THAT'S BEING. TALKED ABOUT A

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:35.459
LOT AND IT TRANSIT WELL PUBLIC

00:46:35.526 --> 00:46:37.461
IT'S SO CERTAINLY SOMETHING.

00:46:37.528 --> 00:46:39.263
OUT IN AS A MENTION TRANSIT

00:46:39.329 --> 00:46:41.131
USERS TO DEPORT

00:46:41.198 --> 00:46:41.732
DISPROPORTIONATELY LOW INCOME.

00:46:41.798 --> 00:46:45.202
AND ENFORCEMENT EXPENSIVE. OF

00:46:45.269 --> 00:46:47.771
AND ALSO. IN FEAR OF INTO THE

00:46:47.838 --> 00:46:48.438
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT

00:46:48.505 --> 00:46:51.575
MAYBE WE- DO SO I THINK THAT

00:46:51.642 --> 00:46:53.076
THERE'S THIS THIS ARGUMENT FOR

00:46:53.143 --> 00:46:54.978
WHY CHARGE FAIRS AT ALL IN AYE.

00:46:55.045 --> 00:46:56.747
IT IS WORTH A LOOK. THE

00:46:56.813 --> 00:46:57.714
NEGATIVE I'M NOT GONNA COME

00:46:57.781 --> 00:46:59.183
DOWN HARD IN THIS POSITION WHEN

00:46:59.249 --> 00:47:01.451
WITH OTHER. BUT I DO WANT TO

00:47:01.518 --> 00:47:02.085
POINT OUT JUST A COUPLE OF

00:47:02.152 --> 00:47:04.221
OTHER THINGS. WE KNOW THAT. THE

00:47:04.288 --> 00:47:05.689
MORE EXPENSIVE TO PROVIDE

00:47:05.756 --> 00:47:07.925
TRANSIT TRIPS ARE CONSUMED ON

00:47:07.991 --> 00:47:09.359
AVERAGE BY THE HIGHEST INCOME

00:47:09.426 --> 00:47:10.460
WRITERS SO THINK WITH THIS WITH

00:47:10.527 --> 00:47:11.562
SOMEONE DRIVING. GOING IN THE

00:47:11.628 --> 00:47:13.063
PEAK HOUR IN THE PEAK DIRECTION

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:14.031
TO THE SENATE THIS IS A

00:47:14.097 --> 00:47:15.766
BUSINESS DISTRICT IN LA OR-

00:47:15.832 --> 00:47:18.101
SACRAMENTO OR THE BAY AREA.

00:47:18.168 --> 00:47:20.504
THAT COSTA INTO SYSTEM A LOT OR

00:47:20.571 --> 00:47:24.575
THE- DAY TRIP ON A BUS OR A

00:47:24.641 --> 00:47:27.277
WEEK ENERGY TRIPPIN OFF. XIN

00:47:27.344 --> 00:47:30.280
FIFTIES THE SKI THE ROCK. IN

00:47:30.347 --> 00:47:32.683
HIGHER THAT. THE SO. L. WE SAY

00:47:32.749 --> 00:47:35.219
THAT THE SUBSIDIES HER. PER

00:47:35.285 --> 00:47:36.687
MILE THE MUCH HIGHER FOR A-

00:47:36.753 --> 00:47:38.055
THERE'S A LOWER INCOME RIGHT.

00:47:38.121 --> 00:47:39.156
IF WE PROVIDE FREE TO EVERYONE

00:47:39.223 --> 00:47:40.891
THAT DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING.

00:47:40.958 --> 00:47:43.393
THAT THAT UNEQUAL SUBSIDY IT IS

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:46.597
THE SEVEN THE COST OF PROVIDING

00:47:46.663 --> 00:47:47.130
A FREE RIDE SOME KINDS OF

00:47:47.197 --> 00:47:49.099
WRITERS INSPIRED. IS THAT VERSE

00:47:49.166 --> 00:47:51.101
PERHAPS. EQUITY ISSUES BECOME

00:47:51.168 --> 00:47:52.736
AN ISSUE WITH FOR TRANSIT. A

00:47:52.803 --> 00:47:55.239
SECOND IS THAT AB WELL SYSTEMS

00:47:55.305 --> 00:47:56.440
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT LOSING

00:47:56.506 --> 00:47:58.809
RIDERSHIP THEY AGAIN SCALE

00:47:58.875 --> 00:47:59.977
THEIR SYSTEM FOR THEIR PEAK

00:48:00.043 --> 00:48:02.045
DIRECTION PEAK DEMAND. THAT'S

00:48:02.112 --> 00:48:03.947
WHAT DRIVES THEIR- SO BART

00:48:04.014 --> 00:48:05.749
RIGHT NOW IT FINISHING THAT

00:48:05.816 --> 00:48:06.650
COURT THE PATH TO THE EXPANSION

00:48:06.717 --> 00:48:10.887
IN THE- IN THE THAT CENTRAL AIR.

00:48:10.954 --> 00:48:11.655
THREE THREE BILLION DOLLARS

00:48:11.722 --> 00:48:17.160
THEY'RE LOOKING AT. EIGHT

00:48:17.227 --> 00:48:24.835
BILLION. THANKS TO GRAY THAT IS

00:48:24.901 --> 00:48:28.872
BASED AS AN. AMANDA THE PEAK

00:48:28.939 --> 00:48:30.707
TIMES IN COULD INADVERTENTLY

00:48:30.774 --> 00:48:33.410
INCREASE COSTS A LOT. SO OF THE

00:48:33.477 --> 00:48:34.978
FINALLY THERE IS RESEARCH ON

00:48:35.045 --> 00:48:36.813
FARE FREE TRANSIT AND IT DOES

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:39.383
SUGGEST THAT LOWER INCOME

00:48:39.449 --> 00:48:41.551
RIDERS WILL TEND TO RESPOND

00:48:41.618 --> 00:48:43.420
MORE THAT TH HIGHER INCOME

00:48:43.487 --> 00:48:44.488
WRITER SO THAT THERE IS SOME

00:48:44.554 --> 00:48:47.424
EVIDENCE THAT BENEFIT CAN

00:48:47.491 --> 00:48:50.994
ACCRUE TO PROVIDE CARE FREE IT.

00:48:51.061 --> 00:48:53.730
THERE'S GONNA SUCH PEOPLE ARE

00:48:53.797 --> 00:48:55.632
MORE LA IN THE WRIST TO BETTER

00:48:55.699 --> 00:48:56.900
TRANSIT SERVICE THE LOWER

00:48:56.967 --> 00:48:59.569
TRANSIT PRICES THAT IS THAT

00:48:59.636 --> 00:49:01.538
EVEN A PLAN COME LEVELS PEOPLE

00:49:01.605 --> 00:49:02.773
ARE MORE RESPONSIVE LOWER WHAT

00:49:02.839 --> 00:49:04.708
TIMES IN YOUR TRANSIT SERVICE

00:49:04.775 --> 00:49:07.577
EVEN IN LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS

00:49:07.644 --> 00:49:08.779
SO. ABOUT TWO WEEKS THREE

00:49:08.845 --> 00:49:09.713
HUNDRED AND MILLION DOLLARS IN

00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:11.014
ELIMINATING FAIR IS A DO WE

00:49:11.081 --> 00:49:11.915
SPEND THREE AND FIFTY MILLION

00:49:11.982 --> 00:49:13.650
DOLLARS IN INCREASING THE

00:49:13.717 --> 00:49:15.218
FREQUENCY AND RELIABILITY A BUS

00:49:15.285 --> 00:49:17.054
SERVICE. ON AVERAGE OF WITH

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:19.990
MORE RIDERS DOING BATTER AGAIN

00:49:20.057 --> 00:49:21.658
THAT THAT'S NOT IN ALL CASES

00:49:21.725 --> 00:49:23.493
AND THERE MAY BE A CASE AND I

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:26.930
COULD TALK ABOUT IT IF YOU HAVE

00:49:26.997 --> 00:49:30.167
QUESTIONS ABOUT A WIN. WHAT

00:49:30.233 --> 00:49:33.370
CIRCUMSTANCES COME RIGHT. AND

00:49:33.437 --> 00:49:34.471
IF IT MORE. HE CAN OFF BEACON

00:49:34.538 --> 00:49:36.039
BECAUSE HIGHER INCOME WRITERS

00:49:36.106 --> 00:49:37.908
TO RIDE IN THE PEAK ACTION THE

00:49:37.974 --> 00:49:39.509
PEAK HOUR. DOING THINGS LIKE

00:49:39.576 --> 00:49:40.844
SAYING YOU PAY ONLY FOR THE

PEAK HOUR PEAK DIRECTION TRIPS

00:49:41.978 --> 00:49:44.014
AND THEN WE PROVIDE YOU FREE

00:49:44.081 --> 00:49:46.550
TRANSIT AT ALL OTHER TIMES. WE

00:49:46.616 --> 00:49:49.186
LIKELY HAVE MUCH. LOWER

00:49:49.252 --> 00:49:50.754
FINANCIAL HIT BANDED UP. AND

00:49:50.821 --> 00:49:53.957
WOOD I THINK IT FREE TO A- AND-

00:52:14.564 --> 00:52:17.834
SEE AS- AS TEN OF FIVE ACCESS

00:52:17.901 --> 00:52:20.470
TO. BILLS THE RACING AUTO

00:52:20.537 --> 00:52:23.373
ACCESS IN COME COMMUNITY THE

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:27.310
BOUNCE OF WHICH FOR BLOWING

00:52:27.377 --> 00:52:30.747
ISN'T IT. I THINK THIS WILL

00:52:30.814 --> 00:52:32.883
PLAY BETTER ELSE IS WHAT

00:52:32.949 --> 00:52:35.051
POLLUTION ELLEN THE UP AND THEN

00:52:35.118 --> 00:52:38.288
CONGESTION. HOW DO WE ADDRESS

00:52:38.355 --> 00:52:41.291
THOSE ISSUES OF THE ISSUES OF

00:52:41.358 --> 00:52:44.060
POLLUTION AND CONGESTION AND

00:52:44.127 --> 00:52:47.964
MAINTAIN A MARKER TO THE XIN

00:52:48.031 --> 00:52:51.201
THAT HAS THAT HAS TAKEN. SO OF

00:52:51.268 --> 00:52:53.537
THE WAY I WOULD PUT IT IS THEY

00:52:53.603 --> 00:52:54.571
HAVE SPENT THE BETTER THAN A

00:52:54.638 --> 00:52:56.873
CENTURY DESIGNING CALIFORNIA

00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:59.643
CITIES AROUND PRIVATE VEHICLE

00:52:59.709 --> 00:53:01.678
TRAVEL. AND IT SHOULDN'T

00:53:01.745 --> 00:53:03.880
SURPRISE US THAT AFTER IS EIGHT

00:53:03.947 --> 00:53:06.249
THE PEOPLE WHO CAN ACCESS ICAL

00:53:06.316 --> 00:53:09.519
DO A SIGNIFICANT IF IT'S- THE

00:53:09.586 --> 00:53:12.122
PROBLEM IS. THAT THE COLLECTED

00:53:12.188 --> 00:53:13.590
USABLE THAT TRAVEL IN IT IN

00:53:13.657 --> 00:53:14.758
POSES ENORMOUS BURDENS ON ON

00:53:14.824 --> 00:53:17.260
THE ENVIRONMENT AND ON SOCIETY.

00:53:17.327 --> 00:53:19.529
AND THE WAY WE PUT IT IS THAT

00:53:19.596 --> 00:53:21.464
PROBABLY IS NOT A BAD THING

00:53:21.531 --> 00:53:23.800
THAT THAT IN SOME REAL WHEN

00:53:23.867 --> 00:53:26.770
COME HELL SO WE'RE ABLE TO

00:53:26.836 --> 00:53:28.838
DRIVE A LITTLE MORE. ALL HAVE

00:53:28.905 --> 00:53:30.774
AN OBLIGATION TO CREATE IT

00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:32.175
SENT. TO THE EVERYONE LOVES

00:53:32.242 --> 00:53:34.511
LESS. AT THOSE THINGS ARE NOT

00:53:34.578 --> 00:53:35.712
NECESSARY IT ALL ADDS I DON'T

00:53:35.779 --> 00:53:37.981
WE'D WANT ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY

00:53:38.048 --> 00:53:39.716
TO. I BEEN FORTY OUT OF

00:53:39.783 --> 00:53:40.317
SOMETHING THAT APRIL EVERYONE

00:53:40.383 --> 00:53:42.652
ELSE ENJOYS. AND THAT'S WHERE

00:53:42.719 --> 00:53:44.087
THAT'S WHERE I MADE THE COP

00:53:44.154 --> 00:53:45.055
ABOUT YOU KNOW THE TRANSIT

00:53:45.121 --> 00:53:47.691
OPERATORS. DOING EVERYTHING

00:53:47.757 --> 00:53:50.660
THEY CAN TO AND IT'S REALLY

00:53:50.727 --> 00:53:52.829
RIDERSHIP. IT IS OPERATE WITH

00:53:52.896 --> 00:53:55.498
ONE HAND TIED BEHIND ACT IS A-

00:53:55.565 --> 00:53:56.866
THE PROCESSING POWER. THAT MAKE

00:53:56.933 --> 00:53:58.368
IT EASY EN CONVENIENT FOR

00:53:58.435 --> 00:54:00.036
EVERYONE TO DRIVE TO MOST

00:54:00.103 --> 00:54:01.805
DESTINATIONS AND AS LONG AS WE

00:54:01.871 --> 00:54:03.873
HAVE THAT. IS GOING ON LIKE.

00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:04.841
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE

00:54:04.908 --> 00:54:08.511
STRUGGLE AND- THE DELAY HAVE IS

00:54:08.578 --> 00:54:10.313
AT THIS PEOPLE IF YOU WERE ON

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:12.482
PUBLIC TRANSIT AND STUCK IN

00:54:12.549 --> 00:54:15.952
TRAFFIC IN ITSELF FIND TO GET A

00:54:16.019 --> 00:54:17.053
CAR AND DRIVE. THE LOWER YOUR

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:19.289
TRAVEL TIMES EVEN AS YOU IMPOSE

00:54:19.356 --> 00:54:21.291
MORE DELAY. THE PEOPLE LEFT ON

00:54:21.358 --> 00:54:22.626
THAT TRANSIT VEHICLE THAT'S

00:54:22.692 --> 00:54:23.827
SOMETHING WE'RE IN ACTUAL

00:54:23.893 --> 00:54:26.930
BEHAVIOR RESULTS IN INTO A

00:54:26.997 --> 00:54:28.198
COLLECT TIONAL RESULTS. AND SO

00:54:28.264 --> 00:54:31.401
UNTIL WE HAVE SOME OF AN

00:54:31.468 --> 00:54:32.335
INCENTIVE SYSTEM IN PLACE.

00:54:32.402 --> 00:54:32.836
WHETHER IT'S SOMEONE THE

00:54:32.902 --> 00:54:35.338
REGULATE THROUGH PARKING. USE

00:54:35.405 --> 00:54:39.342
OF ROADS OR WE DID AT LEAST IS

00:54:39.409 --> 00:54:40.844
TO PRIVILEGE. MOVEMENT OF HIH

00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:42.479
IF IT'S A VEHICLE AND ROADS AND

00:54:42.545 --> 00:54:44.514
I KNOW THAT AN ISSUE HAS BEEN

00:54:44.581 --> 00:54:47.384
INCREASING INTEREST IN IN A IN

00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:49.519
A FOR EXAMPLE BUS LANES

00:54:49.586 --> 00:54:51.688
DIFFICULTIES IN POUNDS OF AND

00:54:51.755 --> 00:54:53.189
TING THOSE. THOSE KINDS OF

00:54:53.256 --> 00:54:53.923
THINGS CAN PRIDE IS A STEP IN

00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:57.794
THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THINGS

00:54:57.861 --> 00:54:58.595
AREN'T AREN'T.AND THERE IS

00:54:58.662 --> 00:55:00.363
THROUGH. THE USE TAX THE OTHER

00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:02.399
KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE DO. WE

00:55:02.465 --> 00:55:04.067
CAN REGULATE MOVEMENT ON THE

00:55:04.134 --> 00:55:05.835
CROWDED STREETS AND ROADS TO

00:55:05.902 --> 00:55:07.704
VARIOUS KINDS OF PRICING

00:55:07.771 --> 00:55:08.505
SCHEMES THAT WE CAN THEN

00:55:08.571 --> 00:55:14.077
PROVIDE. DRIVERS WITH LIFELINE.

00:55:14.144 --> 00:55:16.346
SURE THE- AROUND. ALL OF THAT.

00:55:16.413 --> 00:55:18.148
TRAVELING FOOT BY BIKE BY BUS

00:55:18.214 --> 00:55:19.382
AND BY SCARED RIDE TO IN SEASON

00:55:19.449 --> 00:55:20.550
TRACK. AND THOSE THINGS WILL

00:55:20.617 --> 00:55:22.619
CALL INTO PLACE BUT RIGHT NOW

00:55:22.686 --> 00:55:25.221
TO BE THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM

00:55:25.288 --> 00:55:27.624
IS SOMEONE OWN THEIR CAR AND

00:55:27.691 --> 00:55:30.460
DRIVING IT ANYTIME THEY WANT ME

00:55:30.527 --> 00:55:33.363
WHERE THE- ANSWER OFF THE

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:36.166
TABLE. AS LONG AS THE IS WE'RE

00:55:36.232 --> 00:55:37.634
GONNA BE STRUGGLING AROUND. IS

00:55:37.701 --> 00:55:38.601
OTHER OPTIONS. IF WE'RE ABLE

00:55:38.668 --> 00:55:40.704
TEST A TAB THAT. I THINK THAT

00:55:40.770 --> 00:55:42.172
THE OPPORTUNE. OF CREATE MORE

00:55:42.238 --> 00:55:42.706
TRACTOR TRANS WORK OUT WE

00:55:42.772 --> 00:55:44.374
BECAUSE- DEPEND ON IN PART ON

00:55:44.441 --> 00:55:46.776
IT ABILITY TO MOVE A LOT OF

00:55:46.843 --> 00:55:48.678
PEOPLE THE SAME DIRECTION THE

00:55:48.745 --> 00:55:50.447
SAME TIME. AND IT DOES THAT

00:55:50.513 --> 00:55:52.816
WORK YES HI CONSIDER HOW. WAIT

00:55:52.882 --> 00:55:54.851
SIR. COMES VERY ATTRACTIVE. BUT

00:55:54.918 --> 00:55:55.752
THE DIFFERENCE EVERY MINUTES.

00:55:55.819 --> 00:55:57.687
WILL BOULEVARD OR ON MARKET

00:55:57.754 --> 00:56:02.559
STREET. AND HALF HOUR OR HOUR

00:56:02.625 --> 00:56:06.229
SERVICE IN IN AND OUT PINE.

00:56:06.296 --> 00:56:07.931
WHERE IS ENORMOUS. WHERE WE

00:56:07.997 --> 00:56:11.267
GONNA GET THE- WHERE CARS ARE

00:56:11.334 --> 00:56:11.935
ACTUALLY THE M<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; HARM TO ME.&lt;/c&gt;</u>

00:56:12.001 --> 00:56:12.535
TRY TO THINK ABOUT MAY PRICE

00:56:12.602 --> 00:56:14.237
AUTUMN AND ONE. AND NOT

00:56:14.304 --> 00:56:15.872
NECESSARILY ME THE FACT THAT

00:56:15.939 --> 00:56:17.373
INCOME PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS THEM

00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:19.442
ON THE BUT A CONTRADICTION ONE

00:56:19.509 --> 00:56:22.612
OF THE- IS IT TO. FOR TO SAY

00:56:22.679 --> 00:56:25.148
THAT AT THE PRESENT TIME. IN

00:56:25.215 --> 00:56:27.817
URBAN AREAS GENERALLY SPEAKING

00:56:27.884 --> 00:56:31.421
THAT THAT. SINGLE PASSENGER

00:56:31.488 --> 00:56:35.625
VEHICLE USE IS AT CAPACITY. IN

00:56:35.692 --> 00:56:37.060
OTHER WORDS IS THERE A DO WE

00:56:37.127 --> 00:56:39.496
ADDITIONAL CAPACITY- IN THE

00:56:39.562 --> 00:56:41.998
ROAD SYSTEM TO ABSORB. UGH AT

00:56:42.065 --> 00:56:44.367
ADDITIONAL SINGLES USE VEHICLE

00:56:44.434 --> 00:56:46.202
TRIPS THAT THAT VARIES

00:56:46.269 --> 00:56:48.104
ENORMOUSLY FROM PLACE TO PLACE

00:56:48.171 --> 00:56:49.405
ENORMOUSLY EVEN WITHIN BIG

00:56:49.472 --> 00:56:51.574
CITIES LIKE THE BEAR AND LA I

00:56:51.641 --> 00:56:54.344
MEAN WE'VE DONE AN ANALYSIS OF

00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:56.312
TRACK DELAYS. LA REGION FOR

00:56:56.379 --> 00:57:00.383
BOTH AND YET THE NET. MONTANA

00:57:00.450 --> 00:57:01.184
ON SERVICE STREETS THINGS ARE

00:57:01.251 --> 00:57:03.586
NOT SO BAD BUT IF FOR EXAMPLE

00:57:03.653 --> 00:57:06.322
THE ARC BETWEEN THE SANTA

00:57:06.389 --> 00:57:09.392
MONICA PIER IN DOWNTOWN. IS NOT

00:57:09.459 --> 00:57:11.294
ACTIVE PASSIVE IT'S WELL BEYOND

00:57:11.361 --> 00:57:13.129
CAPACITY AND SO THAT THAT'S YOU

00:57:13.196 --> 00:57:14.164
KNOW IN IN NOW WHAT WE'RE

00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:15.165
SEEING IS IT'S MOVING OUT OF

00:57:15.231 --> 00:57:17.367
PEAK PERIOD AND ALL DAY. THAT

00:57:17.433 --> 00:57:19.469
HAS SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC

00:57:19.536 --> 00:57:21.037
IMPACTS BECAUSE IT SLOWS THE

00:57:21.104 --> 00:57:23.339
ABILITY TO MOVE TO VARIOUS.

00:57:23.406 --> 00:57:26.276
COURSE INVITE TAXES WILL BE

00:57:26.342 --> 00:57:27.477
PATIENTS PER MILE GO UP

00:57:27.544 --> 00:57:32.182
SIGNIFICANTLY EVEN. SELECT YOUR

00:57:32.248 --> 00:57:34.417
STILL CHIU THE CONSUMER MORE

00:57:34.484 --> 00:57:37.654
MILES IT IS CONGESTED I WENT IN

00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:41.357
AND RAN JERRY IT'S BAD FOR THE-

00:57:41.424 --> 00:57:46.062
BAD. THAT'S RIGHT. THEN

00:57:46.129 --> 00:57:48.932
DEFINITION IT. IF WE WERE FOCUS

00:57:48.998 --> 00:57:50.333
A LIMITED RESOURCE AND EFFORTS

00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:53.169
ON THOSE AREA WHERE THE

00:57:53.236 --> 00:57:58.541
CONGESTION IS GREATEST- I WOULD

00:57:58.608 --> 00:57:59.175
ASSUME THEN THAT WE ACHIEVE THE

00:57:59.242 --> 00:58:00.009
GREATEST VALUE. YEAH IN THE WAY

00:58:00.076 --> 00:58:03.346
TO THINK ABOUT. THE NET WITH

00:58:03.413 --> 00:58:04.247
THE FLOWS OUT OF THAT IS THAT

00:58:04.314 --> 00:58:05.682
LET'S TAKE THAT ARE BETWEEN

00:58:05.748 --> 00:58:07.150
DOWNTOWN IN SANTA MONICA OR WE

00:58:07.217 --> 00:58:10.520
COULD DO THE SAME THING FOR THE

00:58:10.587 --> 00:58:11.888
IN THE BAY AREA. THE NATURAL

00:58:11.955 --> 00:58:13.990
RESPONSE THIS IS. THERE'S ALL

00:58:14.057 --> 00:58:14.524
THIS TO GO ON RUSSIAN OF

00:58:14.591 --> 00:58:17.260
ACTIVITY. AND WE'RE HAVING A

00:58:17.327 --> 00:58:18.928
LOT OF TRAFFIC RESULT- SO

00:58:18.995 --> 00:58:20.964
THEREFORE WE HAVE TO LIMIT THE

00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:23.266
INCREASE IN THE THAT THE- MORE

00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:26.536
ACTIVITY IN THAT AREA IN ORDER

00:58:26.603 --> 00:58:27.937
TO ALLOW THINGS TO WORK THERE

00:58:28.004 --> 00:58:29.172
WERE EVERYWHERE DRIVE ONTO A

00:58:29.239 --> 00:58:30.974
ROAD ANYTIME THEY WANT ANYWHERE

00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:32.041
THEY WANT. SO WE START WITH

00:58:32.108 --> 00:58:33.543
THAT IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE FIRST

00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:35.078
THE FIRST POSITION IS THAT

00:58:35.144 --> 00:58:36.713
EVERYONE CAN DRIVE ANYWHERE

00:58:36.779 --> 00:58:37.614
THEY WANT ANYTIME THEY WANT AND

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:39.482
THEN WE'RE GONNA JUST THE FORM

00:58:39.549 --> 00:58:43.119
OF THE CITY TO FIT THAT. AND

00:58:43.186 --> 00:58:44.020
THAT. THE LEVEL WE HAVE. HIS

00:58:44.087 --> 00:58:46.422
BOB. ENGELS TO LAY. DEVELOP WAS

00:58:46.489 --> 00:58:48.157
BUILT A AREAS. WERE PUSHING

00:58:48.224 --> 00:58:49.525
DEVELOPMENT FARTHER OUT AND

00:58:49.592 --> 00:58:51.094
THAT'S WHERE THE BAY AREA WERE

00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:51.895
SEEING THESE INCREDIBLE

00:58:51.961 --> 00:58:53.796
INCREASES IN COMMUTE DISTANCE.

00:58:53.863 --> 00:58:55.198
EXAMPLE WHICH HAVE EVEN MORE

00:58:55.265 --> 00:58:57.834
PERNICIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL-

00:58:57.901 --> 00:58:59.002
IMPACT THOUGH. THE TO THE

00:58:59.068 --> 00:59:00.536
DENTIST. IN MAKE IT DIFFICULT

00:59:00.603 --> 00:59:01.971
FOR IN THOSE PLACES. THEY

00:59:02.038 --> 00:59:04.073
BECOME THOSE PLACES BEING THE

00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:06.075
DENSE DEVELOP PLACES THEY

00:59:06.142 --> 00:59:07.143
BECOME MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE TO

00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:09.946
ME. ON FOOT. AND BY. ON

00:59:10.013 --> 00:59:12.815
WEDNESDAY. MUCH EASIER TO GET

00:59:12.882 --> 00:59:15.051
AROUND BUT LONG AS THAT THIS.

00:59:15.118 --> 00:59:19.689
FILM CAR. WE IT OF THAT THE WAY

00:59:19.756 --> 00:59:21.124
OF ALL POSSIBLE OTHERS THAT CAN

00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:22.225
ASSIST RESPONSE EITHER WAS

00:59:22.292 --> 00:59:24.460
MANAGE THE PRIVATE VIA. OR WE

00:59:24.527 --> 00:59:25.962
SAY WE TO WREAK THIS A- THE

00:59:26.029 --> 00:59:27.463
FOR. POSITION EVERY INCH BILL

00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:28.498
TO DRIVE ANYWHERE THEY WANT

00:59:28.564 --> 00:59:30.867
ANYTIME THEY WANT AND I THINK

00:59:30.934 --> 00:59:32.936
THAT DISK A LOT OF THE DAY OF

00:59:33.002 --> 00:59:35.605
THE DEBATES WE HAVE. AREA IN LA

00:59:35.672 --> 00:59:37.307
YEAH. I WILL ARE ONE. A

00:59:37.373 --> 00:59:38.708
QUESTION IN OUR COLLEAGUES

00:59:38.775 --> 00:59:39.309
OPPORTUNITY TO. ASK YOU

00:59:39.375 --> 00:59:42.145
QUESTIONS. WE HAVE THE HIGHWAY

00:59:42.211 --> 00:59:44.681
PATROL HERE- TODAY TO A PRESENT

00:59:44.747 --> 00:59:46.716
TO US- LATER ON IN THEIR BUDGET

00:59:46.783 --> 00:59:50.920
ISSUES UP IS- HAVE HAVE YOU

00:59:50.987 --> 00:59:52.889
DONE RESEARCHER YOU'LL WEAR

00:59:52.956 --> 00:59:58.127
RESEARCH ON THE IMPACT OF

00:59:58.194 --> 01:00:01.030
THESE- AT CAPACITOR BEYOND

01:00:01.097 --> 01:00:04.000
CAPACITY STREETS. LAW AND-

01:00:04.067 --> 01:00:06.135
RESPONSE TIMES FOR EMERGENCY

01:00:06.202 --> 01:00:08.504
VEHICLES. I HAVE NOT DONE

01:00:08.571 --> 01:00:11.407
RESEARCH ON THAT THERE IS

01:00:11.474 --> 01:00:12.942
RESEARCH ON THAT. AND I COULD

01:00:13.009 --> 01:00:14.711
REFER YOU TO I DO WANT TO MAKE

01:00:14.777 --> 01:00:16.746
ANY COMMENT ON THAT THAT HERE I

01:00:16.813 --> 01:00:19.082
DO KNOW FROM THE ONE PIECE THAT

01:00:19.148 --> 01:00:20.550
I READ THESE QUITE A FEW YEARS

01:00:20.616 --> 01:00:22.885
AGO IS THAT. THE AVERAGE DID

01:00:22.952 --> 01:00:24.320
SAID THAT YOU NEED TO TRAVEL IN

01:00:24.387 --> 01:00:25.421
THOSE PLACES LIKE TO THINK OF

01:00:25.488 --> 01:00:26.689
IT IN A IN A DENSELY DEVELOPED

01:00:26.756 --> 01:00:29.192
AREA. THE AVERAGE DISTANCE TO

01:00:29.258 --> 01:00:32.428
HOSPITAL IS MUCH LOWER THAN IT

01:00:32.495 --> 01:00:35.465
WOULD BE AN KALANGA- SO THAT

01:00:35.531 --> 01:00:38.968
THE QUESTION OF HOW MUCH THE A-

01:00:39.035 --> 01:00:40.570
A IS GOOD. YOU KNOW AT SOME

01:00:40.636 --> 01:00:41.904
POINT IN HEAVILY CONGESTED

01:00:41.971 --> 01:00:43.773
ROADS AND- IS THE VEHICLE. HAVE

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:44.707
TROUBLE GETTING THROUGH BECAUSE

01:00:44.774 --> 01:00:45.742
PEOPLE PHYSICALLY CAN'T MOVE

01:00:45.808 --> 01:00:48.077
ASIDE BUT I'M GOOD AT I WOULD

01:00:48.144 --> 01:00:49.278
REFER YOU TO RESEARCH ON THAT

01:00:49.345 --> 01:00:51.514
RATHER THAN FLOOD OF COURSE IS

01:00:51.581 --> 01:00:53.449
A- FOR THOSE OF US WHO LIVE IN.

01:00:53.516 --> 01:00:55.718
URBAN AREAS VERSUS RURAL AREAS

01:00:55.785 --> 01:00:58.821
ONE OF THE- ASSUMED AMENITIES

01:00:58.888 --> 01:01:01.391
IS BEING CLOSER TO MANY

01:01:01.457 --> 01:01:03.226
SERVICES INCLUDING EMERGENCY

01:01:03.292 --> 01:01:06.596
SIR THROW. UP I THINK GUYS IN

01:01:06.662 --> 01:01:07.397
THERE I WOULD INTERESTED IN

01:01:07.463 --> 01:01:09.999
SEEING THAT RESEARCH IF YOU

01:01:10.066 --> 01:01:14.937
HAVE. TO GET TO ME. FOR I JUST

01:01:15.004 --> 01:01:17.073
A FEW QUICK QUESTIONS IN TERMS

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:18.107
OF YOUR AT YOUR WORK YOUR

01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:20.610
RESEARCH- IN TERMS OF THE

01:01:20.676 --> 01:01:21.778
SURVEYS YOU DEVON PEOPLE WHO

01:01:21.844 --> 01:01:24.047
RIDE AND USE PUBLIC TRANSIT IS

01:01:24.113 --> 01:01:26.849
CONVENIENCE FACTOR AND GENDER

01:01:26.916 --> 01:01:28.985
THE RIDE HAILING RIDE SHARING-

01:01:29.052 --> 01:01:31.287
PLATFORMS- DO THE PUBLIC

01:01:31.354 --> 01:01:34.023
TRANSIT. OPERATIONS DO THEY NOW

01:01:34.090 --> 01:01:35.558
HAVE TO ADD. YOU KNOW CHANGE

01:01:35.625 --> 01:01:37.293
THE BUSINESS MODEL OF THE WAY

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.429
THEY OPERATE IF AND I LISTEN

01:01:39.495 --> 01:01:41.397
BAKERSFIELD. THE OUR PUBLIC

01:01:41.464 --> 01:01:42.432
TRANSIT IS MOVING MORE YOU

01:01:42.498 --> 01:01:44.634
TRYING TO INSTEAD OF HAVING

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:45.234
PEOPLE GO TO THE BUS STATION

01:01:45.301 --> 01:01:47.136
BUT- PICKING THEM THEM UP AND

01:01:47.203 --> 01:01:49.372
MOVING MORE OF A- A MOVING

01:01:49.439 --> 01:01:52.208
TOWARD MORE RIDE SHARING MODEL.

01:01:52.275 --> 01:01:53.409
WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU- WILL WILL

01:01:53.476 --> 01:01:56.813
WHICH IS COMMON SPEED SO.

01:01:56.879 --> 01:01:57.413
THERE'S A LOT OF REACH GENERAL

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:59.382
STATUS OF IT HERE'S SUGGEST

01:01:59.449 --> 01:02:01.818
THAT PEOPLE WHO. THE TRAIN THEN

01:02:01.884 --> 01:02:04.487
HOW ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE TRIP.

01:02:04.554 --> 01:02:05.088
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH REPUBLICANS

01:02:05.154 --> 01:02:06.422
EXPERIENCE IN THIS SORT OF

01:02:06.489 --> 01:02:07.256
MAKES SENSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT

01:02:07.323 --> 01:02:09.425
IT. THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE A CAR

01:02:09.492 --> 01:02:11.727
AVAILABLE FOR THEIR TRIP. ARE

01:02:11.794 --> 01:02:13.830
OFTEN LET LESS HAPPY WITH IT

01:02:13.896 --> 01:02:17.467
IT'S IN ONE CASE SOMEONE HAD AN

01:02:17.533 --> 01:02:18.067
ALTERNATIVE. IS IN PUBLIC. IS

01:02:18.134 --> 01:02:19.168
THE FELT AN ALTERNATIVE TO

01:02:19.235 --> 01:02:22.138
THEIR TRIPS WERE THAT WOULD.

01:02:22.205 --> 01:02:26.409
THE HAVES. IN THIS IS. THAT IF.

01:02:26.476 --> 01:02:26.943
BUT NOT NOT STATISTICALLY

01:02:27.009 --> 01:02:28.444
RIGOROUS WORK BUT KIND OF FOCUS

01:02:28.511 --> 01:02:30.413
GROUP WORK THAT SUGGESTS THAT

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.981
PEOPLE WHO DEPEND ON TRANSIT A

01:02:32.048 --> 01:02:34.650
LOT BUT HAVE THE OPTION OF

01:02:34.717 --> 01:02:37.120
OCCASIONALLY TAKING A TNC TO BE

01:02:37.186 --> 01:02:40.923
MORE SATISFIED WITH THE TRANS

01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:42.191
AND AS AT VARIOUS POINTS MUCH I

01:02:42.258 --> 01:02:43.593
WAS COMPLETELY TRANCE. AND

01:02:43.659 --> 01:02:47.230
GREAT 42820% SOMETIMES IT WAS

01:02:47.296 --> 01:02:49.532
NOT SO CONVENIENT- YOU KNOW AT

01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:51.334
THE BUS STOP RUNNING- SOMETHING

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:53.169
LIKE THAT AND SO WE COULD

01:02:53.236 --> 01:02:54.537
PROVIDE NICE COMPLIMENTARY

01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:57.673
SERVICE NOW THE OTHER THING

01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:58.875
THAT MENTIONED IS THAT AGAIN

01:02:58.941 --> 01:03:01.244
TRADITIONAL STREET FIX GET

01:03:01.310 --> 01:03:05.248
PUBLIC TRANSIT FACT IT PLACES

01:03:05.314 --> 01:03:08.084
WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE TRAVEL

01:03:08.151 --> 01:03:12.021
SECTION TIME. IS YEAH IT

01:03:12.088 --> 01:03:14.123
PROVIDE. WHERE WRITING THE SAME

01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:15.558
DIRECTION SAME TIME IN THOSE

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:17.026
CASES VARIOUS KINDS OF

01:03:17.093 --> 01:03:18.227
PARATRANSIT WE USED TO SAY OR

01:03:18.294 --> 01:03:21.664
EVEN THESE KINDS OF SERVICES

PROVIDE HIGHER QUALITY SERVICE

01:03:23.933 --> 01:03:26.335
BUT THAT CAN OR- COULD YOU GET

INTO AREAS WHERE THERE'S A

01:03:28.037 --> 01:03:29.472
HIGHER COUNTRY IN SCHOOL NEAR

OFF ECONOMICALLY AND

01:03:32.508 --> 01:03:34.577
ENVIRONMENTALLY SO WE CAN THINK

01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:38.281

RIDERSHIP HAS BEEN DECLINING

01:05:49.312 --> 01:05:53.215
PASS TWO YEARS. WE SEE PROBABLY

01:05:53.282 --> 01:05:54.850
ABOUT IT FOR THE- SAN. THIS

01:05:54.917 --> 01:05:58.621
TIME. TEMPORE THAT WE OUGHT TO

INTERNAL EXTERNAL THEY'RE

01:05:59.989 --> 01:06:02.325
IMPACTING. AND HAD WE HAD THOSE.

01:06:02.391 --> 01:06:03.893
AND READING THROUGH A PROFESSOR

01:06:03.959 --> 01:06:05.895
TAYLOR'S WORK- THE ISSUE IS

01:06:05.961 --> 01:06:08.531
SPEED COMES UP A LOT-

01:06:08.597 --> 01:06:09.098
ESPECIALLY IN THE BAY AREA-

01:06:09.165 --> 01:06:11.667
ANALYSIS- FASTER TRAVEL TIMES

01:06:11.734 --> 01:06:13.235
MORE COMPETITIVE TRAVEL TIMES

01:06:13.302 --> 01:06:15.438
ARE ARE REALLY A KEY TO. THE

01:06:15.504 --> 01:06:17.340
SUCCESS OF TRANSIT AND THAT

01:06:17.406 --> 01:06:19.475
AND- WE HAVE A NEXT GEN BUS

01:06:19.542 --> 01:06:21.444
RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM GOING ON

01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:22.845
RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT THE

01:06:22.912 --> 01:06:24.180
ENTIRE BUS NETWORK

01:06:24.246 --> 01:06:25.715
RESTRUCTURING IT TO BE MORE

01:06:25.781 --> 01:06:27.049
REFLECTIVE OF THE WAY PEOPLE I

01:06:27.116 --> 01:06:28.684
WILL TODAY. AND THEN PUTTING

01:06:28.751 --> 01:06:30.052
THE TRANSIT US PART OF

01:06:30.119 --> 01:06:32.021
INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THAT

01:06:32.088 --> 01:06:33.155
AND A LOT OF PEACE OF THAT FOR

01:06:33.222 --> 01:06:34.857
STRUCTURE PROGRAM IS REALLY TO

01:06:34.924 --> 01:06:37.560
IMPROVE SPEED RELIABILITY A. K.

01:06:37.626 --> 01:06:40.029
A. BUS LANES- SIGNAL PRIORITY

01:06:40.096 --> 01:06:44.333
AND SO FORTH- WE FEEL THAT

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:48.070
THAT'S A- COMPONENT. I SAID.

01:06:48.137 --> 01:06:52.541
AND ONE OF. A BUS ONLY IN

01:06:52.608 --> 01:07:04.887
FLOWER STREET BETWEEN DOT A.

01:07:04.954 --> 01:07:07.356
80% OF THE PASSENGERS ARE THE

01:07:07.423 --> 01:07:08.290
PEOPLE THAT FLOW THROUGH THAT

01:07:08.357 --> 01:07:10.326
COURT. SO THE BUSTLING WAS

01:07:10.393 --> 01:07:11.927
REALLY USEFUL IN TERMS OF

01:07:11.994 --> 01:07:13.429
IMPROVING THE OVERALL TRAVEL

01:07:13.496 --> 01:07:14.764
TIMES DOWN THE CORRIDOR BY AN

01:07:14.830 --> 01:07:16.432
AVERAGE OF FOURTEEN PERCENT.

01:07:16.499 --> 01:07:18.067
AND IN SOME SEGMENTS OF THE

01:07:18.134 --> 01:07:19.268
QUARTER WE ACTUALLY SAW AN

01:07:19.335 --> 01:07:20.603
INCREASE OR AN IMPROVEMENT IN

01:07:20.669 --> 01:07:23.239
SPEED. BY UP TO THIRTY PERCENT.

01:07:23.305 --> 01:07:24.974
AS WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO BUILD

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:27.309
OUT OUR MOSTLY NETWORK

01:07:27.376 --> 01:07:28.277
CURRENTLY HAS ABOUT TWENTY

01:07:28.344 --> 01:07:29.612
SEVEN MILES A BUS LANES WE'RE

01:07:29.678 --> 01:07:32.415
LOOKING AT A MEANT BEING. OUT A

01:07:32.481 --> 01:07:33.549
HUNDRED OVER A HUNDRED MILES OF

01:07:33.616 --> 01:07:36.385
US NEEDS THROUGH OUR- NEXT GEN

01:07:36.452 --> 01:07:39.155
BUT STUDY. AND A LARGER THAT

01:07:39.221 --> 01:07:39.688
THE SUCCESS IS REALLY THE

01:07:39.755 --> 01:07:42.158
ENFORCEMENT OF LANES. SO WE ARE

01:07:42.224 --> 01:07:44.627
SPONSORING BILL ASSEMBLY I A.

01:07:44.693 --> 01:07:48.731

TO IN AUTOMATED BUS LANE

01:07:57.239 --> 01:07:58.541
ENFORCEMENT. AND SO THAT'S A

01:07:58.607 --> 01:08:00.176
CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE

01:08:00.242 --> 01:08:02.912
SUCCESS OF BUS LANES I AND THE

01:08:02.978 --> 01:08:04.480
SUCCESS OF TRANSIT ITSELF.

01:08:04.547 --> 01:08:06.982
ANOTHER AREA OF IMPROVEMENT

01:08:07.049 --> 01:08:08.584
THAT WE SAW AND PROFESSOR

01:08:08.651 --> 01:08:10.519
TAILORED TOUCHED ON IT IS

01:08:10.586 --> 01:08:12.154
REALLY. A FREQUENCY. BECAUSE

01:08:12.221 --> 01:08:13.355
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SHORT

01:08:13.422 --> 01:08:17.126
DISTANCE TRIPS. YOUR YOUR TIME

01:08:17.193 --> 01:08:18.027
ACCESSING THE BUS STOP OR

01:08:18.093 --> 01:08:19.495
WALKING A ROLLING TO THE BUS

01:08:19.562 --> 01:08:21.464
STOP. AND WAITING FOR THE BUS

01:08:21.530 --> 01:08:23.265
IT EQUALLY IMPORTANT AS YOUR

01:08:23.332 --> 01:08:25.267
MOM VEHICLE. TIMES PERCEIVED

01:08:25.334 --> 01:08:26.669
MORE OF YOUR TIME. ENTER YOUR

AND TO AND TRIP. SO IMPROVING

01:08:28.704 --> 01:08:30.372
FREQUENCIES IS CRITICAL IN

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:32.107
TERMS OF ATTRACTING PEOPLE OR

01:08:32.174 --> 01:08:36.011
MAKING TRANCE. COMPETITIVE AS

01:08:36.078 --> 01:08:39.281
THE FOR SHORT. THAT WILL.

01:08:39.348 --> 01:08:43.552
RESEARCH NOTED THAT ALMOST HALF.

01:08:43.619 --> 01:08:47.490
CENTER AT. IN LA COUNTY OF WHAT

SO WHAT ARE YOUR TRANS OR WHAT

01:08:49.458 --> 01:08:50.226
NOT OVER HALF FOR ALMOST HALF

01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:51.760
OF THE ARE ONE AND FIVE MILES

01:08:51.827 --> 01:08:53.929
SO THE RELATIVELY SHORT- AND

01:08:53.996 --> 01:08:55.564
THE CHAIR AND GENTLY HAPPENED

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:57.433

WAY INTO THE WEEKENDS SO LARGE

01:09:02.738 --> 01:09:07.176
OF OUR NEXT STEP IS REALLY TO

01:09:07.243 --> 01:09:09.411

YOU WE CAN PUT OUT THERE ARE

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:19.455
PART OF THE PAYMENT SO TO SPEAK

01:09:19.522 --> 01:09:21.156
TO PUT THAT FREQUENCY IS

01:09:21.223 --> 01:09:22.324
THROUGH SPEEDING UP THE BUS

01:09:22.391 --> 01:09:24.293
NETWORK BECAUSE WHEN YOU SPEED

01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:25.828
UP THE BUS NETWORK THAT BUS CAN

01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:29.832
MAKE MORE TRIPS OUR I CURRENTLY.

01:09:29.899 --> 01:09:32.368

VERY LITTLE ADDITIONAL- OFFER

01:09:39.141 --> 01:09:41.577
COST. NOW COMPARE PETTIT MRS

01:09:41.644 --> 01:09:43.445
ONE ASPECT BECAUSE THAT ALLOWS

01:09:43.512 --> 01:09:45.948
TRANSIT TO BE A VIABLE- TRAVEL

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:47.750
OPTION BUT WE ALSO NEED TO BE

01:09:47.816 --> 01:09:49.151
ATTRACTIVE TO BE ABLE TO

01:09:49.218 --> 01:09:50.452
ATTRACT PEOPLE INTO TRANSIT.

01:09:50.519 --> 01:09:51.687

IMPROVE OUR BILL TIME AND

01:09:59.628 --> 01:10:01.697
PATIENCE. CRITICAL I BILL IS

01:10:01.764 --> 01:10:03.132
BECAUSE WE PEOPLE DON'T SEE THE

HAVE THE WILDFIRES DOES TAKE

01:57:36.115 --> 01:57:37.617
HIGHER PRIORITY CLEARING OUT

01:57:37.683 --> 01:57:40.420
THE BURNED AREAS BECAUSE THAT'S

01:57:40.486 --> 01:57:42.121
AT RISK FOR THE MOTORING

01:57:42.188 --> 01:57:43.923

YOU KNOW NECESSARILY. PIECE

01:57:56.402 --> 01:57:58.404
BASS WE WOULD LIKE SO BECAUSE

01:57:58.471 --> 01:58:01.541
OF THAT IT TAKES OF ANOTHER

01:58:01.607 --> 01:58:03.543
CYCLE TO GET TO THE QUESTION

01:58:03.609 --> 01:58:06.279
BECAUSE THE PART. SO IN. IF I

01:58:06.345 --> 01:58:07.880

ROUGHLY IN AND GET OUT BY WAY

01:58:29.101 --> 01:58:30.570
OF EXAMPLE AND- I THINK THE

01:58:30.636 --> 01:58:34.874
DOWNSIDE OF THAT- IS THAT IT-

01:58:34.941 --> 01:58:36.542

LABELED AS AN ACADEMIC. AND

02:54:03.966 --> 02:54:05.768
WHAT I'LL DO NOW IS ALL THAT

02:54:05.835 --> 02:54:07.503
THE SYSTEM CHEAP TO RATE TALK A

02:54:07.570 --> 02:54:09.272
LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT DOJ DOES

02:54:09.338 --> 02:54:11.174
AND THEN I'LL- GO WITH SOME

02:54:11.240 --> 02:54:12.642
OTHER COMMENTS ON. A GOOD

02:54:12.708 --> 02:54:14.177
MORNING. I THINK TO THE

02:54:14.243 --> 02:54:17.680
QUESTION- Y. C. H. P. AND WHAT

02:54:17.747 --> 02:54:19.115
ARE THE OTHER AGENCIES DO AND

02:54:19.182 --> 02:54:20.249
AS COMMITTEE STAFF POINTS OUT

02:54:20.316 --> 02:54:21.417
ME NOW SAYS THERE ARE SOME

02:54:21.484 --> 02:54:23.119
EFFORTS IN THIS AREA. BUT WHAT

02:54:23.186 --> 02:54:24.954
WE'RE FINDING IS WHETHER TO THE

02:54:25.021 --> 02:54:26.088
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH FOR

02:54:26.155 --> 02:54:27.790
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. THESE

02:54:27.857 --> 02:54:28.791
EFFORTS ARE MORE FOR THE

02:54:28.858 --> 02:54:30.526
ENFORCEMENT ARE UNDER AGE TO

02:54:30.593 --> 02:54:32.695
USE. OF OTHERWISE LEGAL

02:54:32.762 --> 02:54:34.864
PRODUCTS AND WHAT WERE INTENDED

02:54:34.931 --> 02:54:36.399
TO FOCUS OUR EFFORTS ARE. IS

02:54:36.465 --> 02:54:38.534
ILLICIT PRODUCTS SO ELITE

02:54:38.601 --> 02:54:40.336
PRODUCTS AND WHEN IT COMES TO

02:54:40.403 --> 02:54:41.637
VAPING. EVEN THOUGH THERE'S NOT

02:54:41.704 --> 02:54:43.406
A LOT OF NOT AND THERE ISN'T A

02:54:43.472 --> 02:54:45.675
LOT OF KNOWLEDGE WE ADMIT THAT

02:54:45.741 --> 02:54:46.809
IN THIS. PART OF THAT IS

02:54:46.876 --> 02:54:48.244
BECAUSE THERE'S NOBODY REALLY

02:54:48.311 --> 02:54:49.879
FOR DONNA WE'RE NOT AWARE IN

02:54:49.946 --> 02:54:51.514
OUR RESEARCH IN OUR EFFORTS WE

02:54:51.581 --> 02:54:52.715
HAVEN'T FOUND ANYBODY THAT'S

02:54:52.782 --> 02:54:54.517
TRULY FOCUSED ON. THE

02:54:54.584 --> 02:54:56.619
ENFORCEMENT OF THE BLACK MARKET

02:54:56.686 --> 02:54:57.720
AND THE ILLICIT PRODUCTS AND I

02:54:57.787 --> 02:54:59.822
THINK THAT'S WHERE. WE WOULD

02:54:59.889 --> 02:55:01.424
HAVE SOME EXPERTISE WHETHER

02:55:01.490 --> 02:55:02.391
IT'S AN ILLICIT DRUGS OR

02:55:02.458 --> 02:55:05.061
OTHERWISE- CRIMINAL ENTERPRISES

02:55:05.127 --> 02:55:05.628
THAT'S WE DO HAVE SOME

02:55:05.695 --> 02:55:06.762
EXPERTISE THAT WE GET MIND

02:55:06.829 --> 02:55:08.831
TOWARDS. DISRUPTING THIS

02:55:08.898 --> 02:55:10.766
UNDERSTANDING WHAT. IS ACTUALLY

02:55:10.833 --> 02:55:12.468
OUT THERE. AND MAYBE GET A

02:55:12.535 --> 02:55:14.303
BETTER HANDLE ON WHERE THE

02:55:14.370 --> 02:55:16.639
STATE GOES. IN THE FUTURE WITH

02:55:16.706 --> 02:55:19.275
THESE EFFORTS. SO I. TAKE YOUR

02:55:19.342 --> 02:55:21.544
POINT THAT THE A CH P. HAS SOME

02:55:21.611 --> 02:55:24.881
EXPERTISE IN IN THESE AREAS

02:55:24.947 --> 02:55:28.017
BUT- SO DOES LOCAL LAW. FIRST

02:55:28.084 --> 02:55:31.420
MAPS JUST UNDERSTAND AND DEPART

02:55:31.487 --> 02:55:32.622
VOEPEL HEALTH I THINK IS. GONNA

02:55:32.688 --> 02:55:34.523
GET ôNG EFFORTS WITH RESPECT

02:55:34.590 --> 02:55:38.261
TO- TOBACCO ISSUES. THIS SEEMS

02:55:38.327 --> 02:55:41.764
TO BE A SHIFT AND I'M TRYING TO

02:55:41.831 --> 02:55:45.201
UNDERSTAND. WHERE THE- THE

02:55:45.268 --> 02:55:47.203
EQUITIES LANARKSHIRE WHAT I

02:55:47.270 --> 02:55:48.738
THINK PART OF IT IS IT'S A

02:55:48.804 --> 02:55:51.040
STATEWIDE EFFORT IN IN ONE OF

02:55:51.107 --> 02:55:51.774
THE THINGS THAT RECENTLY

02:55:51.841 --> 02:55:54.176
HAPPEN- WITH THE RECENT

02:55:54.243 --> 02:55:55.611

WE'VE HAD GREAT SUCCESS THERE.

02:56:04.420 --> 02:56:05.855
AND WE FEEL THAT DOING

02:56:05.922 --> 02:56:07.590
SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR TO THAT

02:56:07.657 --> 02:56:10.493
WORKING WITH DOJ- WE COULD HAVE

02:56:10.559 --> 02:56:13.195
IMPACT ON THIS ISSUE ALSO. ON

02:56:13.262 --> 02:56:13.763
