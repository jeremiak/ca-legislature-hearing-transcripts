THIS JOINT THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE IN THE ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE HEARING -- TO ORDER IT IS THREE OH THREE PM -- GOOD AFTERNOON AND WELCOME TO THE OVERSIGHT HEARING -- BUT OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE IN THE ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE THIS AFTERNOON WE WILL BE DISCUSSING THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. IDENTIFIED BY THE STATE AUDITOR IN HER AUDIT REPORT RELEASED IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR TITLED CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. SEVERAL POURED MINISTRY PRACTICES HAVE HINDERED REDUCTIONS IN RECIDIVISM AND TONIGHT INMATES ACCESS TO IN. PRISON REHABILITATION PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION. TO THE IMPORTANT TOPIC OF IN PRISON REHABILITATION PROGRAMS WE WILL BE TAKING UP THE TOPIC OF REENTRY PROGRAMS IN THIS HEARING. BOTH IN PRISON REHABILITATION PROGRAMS AND REENTRY PROGRAMS CAN HELP REDUCE RECIDIVISM I LIKE TO THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER REGINALD BYRON JONES SAWYER SENIOR. ASSEMBLY MEMBER IAN CALDERON A RECENT FATHER -- FOR THE SECOND TIME. FOR REQUESTING THE AUDIT THAT WE WILL DISCUSS TODAY. THANK YOU ALSO FOR YOUR INTEREST IN THE OVERSIGHT HEARING -- TODAY AS WELL THIS IS INDEED AN IMPORTANT TOPIC -- THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM MORE OVERSIGHT TODAY WILL ALSO BE DISCUSSING THE PARTNER CORRECTION AND REVERT TO REHABILITATION'S PLANS FOR IMPLEMENTING. CHANGES AND CORRECTIVE ACTION SELF INSURE THAT THE REHABILITATION PROGRAMS. ARE WORKING EFFECTIVELY. AS MANY HERE TODAY MAY KNOW THE LEGISLATURE AND PART THANKS TO MY COLLEAGUES HERE OF INCREASED FUNDING SIGNIFICANTLY. AND AN PRISON REHABILITATION PROGRAMS I JUST THREE YEARS AGO WE INCREASE FUNDING BY SIXTY FOUR MILLION ARE APPROXIMATELY OF THE OTHER REPORT IN TODAY'S HEARINGS ARE AIMED AT MAKING SURE THAT THIS FUNDING IS BEING SPENT. CORRECTLY IN A WAY THAT WILL MOST EFFICIENTLY REDUCE RECIDIVISM. OUR DAUGHTER CLEARLY IDENTIFIED SOME THINGS THAT NEED TO CHANGE AT THE DEPARTMENT TO HELP REDUCE RECIDIVISM -- SOME OF THE THINGS IDENTIFIED IS ENSURING ONLY EVIDENCE BASED CURRICULA IS BEING TAUGHT -- SECONDLY INSUREDS MEETING. STAFFING GOALS FOR REHAB PROGRAMS -- ESTABLISHING PERFORMANCE TARGETS FOR REDUCING RECIDIVISM. EVALUATING WHETHER THE PROGRAMS ARE REDUCING RECIDIVISM AND VALIDATING -- THE FARMERS TOOLS FOR EXCESS ASSESSING INMATES REHABILITATIVE NEEDS LOOK FOR TO REPRODUCTIVE AND ROBUST DISCUSSION TODAY REGARDING THE AUDIT REPORT -- WHAT THE DEPARTMENT IS DOING TO IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE BENEFITS THAT CAN BE REALIZED THROUGH BOTH REHABILITATION? AND REINTERPRETED STE. AS I SEE IT OUR GOALS FOR TODAY'S HEARING IS TO ENSURE THAT REHABILITATION AND RE ENTRY PROGRAMS ARE WORKING PROPERLY. I KNOW -- BOTH THE ORIGINAL AUTHORS OF THE ADDED ARE UP HERE AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY'D -- MUCH LIKE TO SEE AS WELL. I LIKE TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR YOUR EFFORTS AND REDUCING RECIDIVISM AND MAKE SURE THESE PROGRAMS ARE WORKING EFFECTIVELY -- WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER FOR OPENING COMMENTS FROM FIRST THE CHAIR OF PUBLIC SAFETY -- MISTER BYRON JONES SAWYER SENIOR. THANK YOU AND AND I'M I'M SO GLAD WE'RE FINALLY HERE SO DO WE CANNOT TALK ABOUT. ALL OF THE THINGS THAT I HAD HOPED -- WE COULD GET -- TO AND ESPECIALLY SINCE I I KNOW IT'S PROBABLY A BAD TERMS SAY SAY I'M THE CULPRIT THAT STARTED THIS WHOLE THING WITH -- MISTER CALDERON TO TRY TO GET THIS STARTED AND I AND I JUST WANTED TO BE CLEAR. FROM THE ONSET BECAUSE I'VE EITHER BEEN MISQUOTED MISUNDERSTOOD OR P. WHICH IS THAT IT IS MADE UP STUFF ABOUT MY INTENT OF WHY I WANTED TO DO THIS. AND SO LET ME MAKE THIS CLEAR HOPEFULLY ONCE AND FOR ALL -- I AM 1100% -- 1100% OF MY BODY BONE IN. AND THINKING I BELIEVE THE BILL PUSH REAL BILL TATIAN PROGRAMS WORK. MY ISSUE IS I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS PROBABLY HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE WE FUNDING INTO THESE PROGRAMS. THAT THE BEST PROGRAMS ARE CONTINUE TO BE FUNDED AND MORE IMPORTANT THAT WE GROW EVEN MORE SO -- I GUESS WHEN I ALWAYS WOULD SAY THE SECOND PART WHICH IS THE ONES THAT NEED SOME HELP. THAT WE DO PROVIDE THE FUNDING FOR THEM AND THAT WE GET THEM TO CAPACITY WHERE THEY CAN GROW. BUT MOST PEOPLE GENERALLY JUST HERE THE ONES THAT DON'T WORK AND WE CAN SHOW THAT THEY'RE NOT WORKING AND IT NOT ABLE TO GET UP TO CAPACITY. WE HAVE A FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY TO CUT THOSE PROGRAMS AND I'M HOPING THAT WE THEN MOVED THOSE RESOURCES REMEMBER WHAT I SAID THEM REMOVE THOSE. RESOURCES IN MONEY AND AND STAFF OVER TO PROGRAMS THAT ACTUALLY WORK. FOR ME THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT WE NEED TO DO. BECAUSE I WORK FOR CRLA FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND I AM RECOVERING BUREAUCRAT AND I KNOW. WE DON'T AS A GOVERNMENT WE DON'T COOK CUP PROGRAMS. BOB IS MANY TIMES WE LET THINGS LINGER ON AND ON IN THIS WHOLE PROCESS OF WIDGETS IN. AND WE JUST CARE ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE WE TREAT BUT WE NEVER TALK ABOUT HOW MANY. PEOPLE WE HELP THE MOST IMPORTANT HOW EFFECTIVE THEY HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY TALK WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A RETURN ON INVESTMENT -- I NOTICED A NEW TERM EVERYBODY WANTS TO USE THE TERM -- DIVERSION PROGRAMS IN EVIDENCE BASED WELL I LIKE A BUSINESS TERM RETURN ON INVESTMENT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING WHEN WE PUT MONEY INTO REHABILITATION PROGRAMS BECAUSE WE'RE INVESTING IN PEOPLE. AND GUESS WHAT WE ACTUALLY DO. GET A RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT -- INSTEAD OF SPENDING. THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR DJJ PROGRAMS -- AS OF WHICH I'VE SAID A MILLION TIMES WE PROBABLY COULD SEND SOMEONE TO MY ALMA MATER USC. GET A BRAND NEW MERCEDES HAVING GIVEN THE CONDO BUT AFTER FOUR YEARS DATE DATE HAVE A FOUR YEAR DEGREE. TO BE ABLE TO WORK WE'RE SPINNIN AT AND DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND A LOT OF TIMES THAT DOESN'T EQUATE THAT EQUATES INTO SPENDING EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS YEAR. KEEPING THEM INCARCERATED AND IN THE PRISON SYSTEM AND WE DON'T REALLY RUBIO BULLET TAKEN SO THAT'S WHY. IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE WE PUT OUR THINKING CAPS ON AND REALLY START TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN MAKE THESE THIS WORK. IF WE SUCCEED EVERY ABILITY ATION WILL BE ABLE TO DRAMATICALLY CHANGE THE LIFE OF A FORMERLY INCARCERATED INMATE AND CUT DOWN ON THE EVER INCREASING CORRECTIONS BUDGET. WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE I REQUESTED THE OUGHT THE AUDIT HOPING THAT THE INFORMATION WE GOT BACK WOULD HIGHLIGHT SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM. AND ALSO ILLUMINATE WHICH PROGRAMS ARE IN NEED OF ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. TO IMPROVE THEIR SUCCESS RATES. WHAT WE GOT BACK WAS PARTLY POSITIVE IN THAT WE LEARN COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR PROGRAM CBT ARE AVAILABLE IN ALL STATE PRISONS? BUT UNFORTUNATELY MUCH MORE WORK MUST BE DONE. WE LEARNED A TO SYSTEMS FOR PARK PRIORITIZING INMATES FOR PROGRAMMING ARE OUTDATED. WE LEARNED THAT INMATES ARE NOT PRIOR TO RISE FOR PROGRAM PLACEMENT BY NEED AND THERE IS NO SYSTEM IN PLACE TO MAKE. THAT. MAKE SURE THAT THAT INMATES THAT INMATES CLOSEST TO RELEASE ARE PLACED IN PROGRAM. WE LEARNED A PROGRAM'S REALLY HAVE PERFORMANCE METRICS TO EVALUATE OUTCOMES. WE ALSO LEARNED SOME POSITIVE THINGS AS WELL LEARN THAT. THAT AT ELEVEN AT 11% SUCCESS WORK RATE THAT WOULD MEAN TO PROGRAMS PAY FOR THEMSELVES. LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN. IF ONE IN NINE PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS. DO NOT RETURN TO JAIL OR PRISON. WE COULD SAVE THE STATE NEARLY THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. WE LEARNED THAT THE CAL. P. I. A PROGRAMS THOSE THAT TRAIN INMATES AND UNION AFFILIATED TRADE PROGRAMS ALSO HAVE REMARKABLE SUCCESS. NOT ONLY DO THESE PROGRAMS LEAD TO INMATES ENTERING THE WORKFORCE WOULD GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS BUT THEY ALSO REPORTED A RECIDIVISM RATE. OF ONLY 7%. IT'S DATA LIKE THIS THAT IS MY INTEREST TODAY. I THINK WE ABLE TATIAN PROGRAMS WERE TOO IMPORTANT FOR US NOT TO DO ANYTHING. AND NOT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO SEE THEM SUCCEED SUCCEED FURTHER AS STEWARDS OF THE PUBLIC'S MONEY IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE MAKE WISE INVESTMENTS IN TRACK DATA. THIS IS THE SUBJECT OF MY INTEREST TODAY. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT WORKS SO WE CAN DOUBLE DOWN. ON IT I WANT TO KNOW WHAT DOESN'T WORK SO WE CAN ADJUST AND FIX IT. I WANT TO KNOW WHERE WE NEED MORE RESOURCES SO WE CAN ADVOCATE FOR THEM. AND I WANT TO KNOW WHERE THERE IS WAY SO WE CAN MAKE CHANGES FOR ME REAL WITH PATIENT REHABILITATION IS A MORAL ISSUE BUT IS ALSO A FINANCIAL ONE AS WELL. IS THE FACT THAT EVERY INMATE COSTS EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR TO HOUSE IN ADDITION EACH PERSON KEPT BEHIND BARS ALSO MEANS A LOSS OF PROPERTY TAX. INCOME TAX AND SALES TAX TO SOMETHING OF DISTASTE NOTHING OF THE VALUE OF EACH INDIVIDUAL TO THE FAMILY COMMUNITY. WE CAN QUALIFY QUANTIFY THE SAVINGS AND CAPTURE THEM THIS IS WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT WE CAN PROVE THE VALUE REHABILITATION PROGRAMS WE CAN LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE FUNDING. WE CAN SUPPORT THE ARE. IN CD C. R. BUT WE CAN ALSO DO THAT WITH DEPARTMENTAL BY IN TO HELP US UNDERSTAND SUCCESS. I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THAT CONVERSATION TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS I THINK -- THAT'S THE ULTIMATE GOAL FOR TODAY IS FINDING OUT WHICH PROGRAMS ARE EFFICIENT WHAT WORDS ARE NOT HOW DO WE GET. PEOPLE TO HOW DO WE REDUCE RECIDIVISM RATE WITH WHICH PROGRAMS I APPRECIATE THE AUDITOR AND HER. HER WORK IN HELPING GUIDE SOME OF THESE DISCUSSIONS TODAY -- AND FROM WHAT THAT WE HAVE AN OPENING COMMENT FROM OUR MAJORITY LEADER MISTER CALDERON. THANK YOU AS CHAIR SAUCE AND AND I ONE THING BOTH CHAIRS FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY TO PARTICIPATE THIS OVERSIGHT HEARING ALSO WANT TO THANK OUR AUDITOR. FOR BEING HERE TO GO OVER THE THAT THE ARTISTS FINDINGS WITH US. I LAST YEAR I I DID PARTNER WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER TO REQUEST THAT THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE APPROVING NOT IT -- TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CDC OURS IN PRISON REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS. CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS REHABILITATION'S OFFERS INMATES VARIOUS REAL BIT REHABILITATION PROGRAMS WHILE THEY'RE IN PRISON INCLUDING EDUCATION AND SUBSTANCE USE OR THIS ORDER TREAT TREATMENT PROGRAMS. THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THESE PROGRAMS IS TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM. OUR AUTO REQUEST STEM FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE REPORT FROM DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ON IMPROVING. IN PRISON REHABILITATION PROGRAMS WHICH FOUND SEVERAL SHORTCOMINGS LA OWES REPORT CONCLUDED THAT THE CDC ARE HAS A FLAWED APPROACH FOR MEASURING PROGRAM PERFORMANCE WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHETHER. EXISTING PROGRAM RESOURCES ARE BEING USED EFFECTIVELY. THE RESULTING AUDIT FINDINGS WERE TROUBLING. I WON'T GO INTO A LOT OF THE FINING SINCE THE OTTERS HERE TO GO INTO GREATER DETAIL. THE AUDIT CONCLUDED WITH SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CDC ARE AND THE LEGISLATURE. ALONG WITH MY JOINT AUTHORED ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER I'VE INTRODUCED AB SIXTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WHICH ENDEAVORS TO PURSUE THOSE AUDITS RECOMMENDATIONS. IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT CDC OURS WILL BE REHABILITATION PROGRAMS REDUCE RECIDIVISM. AB SIXTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WILL REQUIRE CDC ARE TO DO THE FOLLOWING. ESTABLISH PERFORMANCE TARGETS INCLUDING ONES FOR REDUCING RECIDIVISM AND DETERMINE THE PROGRAM'S COST EFFECTIVENESS. PARTNER WITH EXTERNAL RESEARCHERS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS REHABILITATION PROGRAMS AND IMPLEMENT A COMPREHENSIVE THREE YEAR PLAN TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN. IN ISSUE AN ANNUAL REPORT BEGINNING FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THAT SHOWS THE PERCENTAGE REDUCTION AND RECIDIVISM THAT CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE REHABILITATION PROGRAMS PRIOR TO PURSUING ANY LET ANY LEGISLATION A RECOMMENDATION RECOMMENDING CHANGES. TO ANY IN PRISON REHABILITATION PROGRAMS WE BELIEVED AN AUDIT WAS NECESSARY TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE CDC OURS PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES. FOR IMPLEMENTING THEIR REAR BELT READ THEIR REHABILITATION PROGRAMS. AB SIXTEEN EIGHTY A WILL RESULT IN A THOROUGH EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A REHABILITATION PROGRAMS TO ENSURE THAT THESE PROGRAMS IN STATE PRISONS AND DO NEED DO INDEED PROMOTE. REDUCTIONS IN RECIDIVISM WE HOPE THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT PUBLIC FUNDS ARE BEING PROPERLY UTILIZED AND THE STATE IS FEELING THE REHABILITATIVE COMPONENT. OF THE CORRECTIONAL EXPERIENCE AND I ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM THE SECONDARY IN BEING INVOLVED OVERALL IN THE OVERSIGHT EVERITT AND JUST AS A PERSONAL SIDE THE REASON THAT I GOT INVOLVED IN THIS ISSUE. IS THAT I LOS AN OFFICER IN MY DISTRICT AND IN REVIEWING A BILL IN DOING THE RESEARCH INTO RECIDIVISM BRAWLING EVERYTHING ELSE ONE OF THE ONE OF THE STAFF TO SET OUT TO ME THE MOST WAS THE FACT THAT -- ALTHOUGH WE AS A STATE -- SPEND AROUND FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ON REHABILITATION PROGRAMS THERE HAD NEVER ONCE BEEN AN AUDIT. OF THE REHABILITATION PROGRAMS -- THROUGH C. C. R. HOW CAN WE EFFECTIVELY SPEND THAT MONEY UNLESS WE'RE BEING TOLD OR HAVE ANY EVIDENCE TO TO POINT DIRECTLY -- TO SPECIFIC INFORMATION THAT EITHER SHOWS US THAT. THESE PROGRAMS THAT WERE PAYING FOR PAYING A LOT OF MONEY FOR OUR AFFECTIVE OR THEY'RE NOT EFFECTIVE THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO -- WITH ANYTHING OTHER THAN MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE PERFORMING ARTS OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY WHEN SPEAKER RENDON TOOK OVER HE WAS VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT HE WANTED US. AS THE LEGISLATURE TO DO ESPECIALLY THROUGH THE COMMITTEE PROCESS AND THAT WAS TO REESTABLISH OUR AUTHORITY THROUGH OVERSIGHT. AND THIS IS WHAT THAT IS REESTABLISHING THE LEGISLATURE'S AUTHORITY TO OVERSIGHT SO THAT WE FULLY. UNDERSTAND COMPETENTLY THE DYNAMICS OF WHICH WE ARE MAKING THE DECISIONS IN THE DETAILS THAT ARE DRIVING THE DECISIONS THAT WERE MAKING THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT THAT'S WHY WE REQUESTED THIS AUDIT THIS AUDIT V. YIELDED THINGS WE KNEW THINGS WE DID AND NOW. AND FOR THAT WE WERE ABLE -- TO AT LEAST I WAS ABLE TO CRAFT A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT I HOPE IS GOING TO GO TOWARDS MAKING -- THIS PROCESS AND A REDUCTION IN RECIDIVISM -- MORTGAGE OF A GUARANTEE AND THAT WE ARE. WE AS A STATE AND THE MONEY THAT WE PUT INTO WERE SEVEN REDUCTION -- IS IS IS A FACT IS AS EFFECTIVE AS WE EXPECTED TO BE BUT IS AS EFFECTIVE AS OUR CONSTITUENTS AND THE PEOPLE THAT WE REPRESENT IN WHOSE MONEY WE'RE SPENDING. NEED THESE PROGRAMS TO BE SO WITH THAT I I AM DONE AND I WANT TO THANK YOU BOTH FOR ALLOW ME TO BE A PART OF THIS HEARING. THANK YOU FOR COMMENTS SO -- I THINK LAST COUNT THERE WAS AT LEAST FOR LEGISLATIVE BILLS A RELATED TO THE AUDIT. IN THE AUDITOR'S FINDINGS SO WITH THAT WILL GO AHEAD AND BEGIN NOT AS GOOD AS MINE BUT YOU CAN HAVE. MISTER CALDERON HAS A PREFERENCE FOR HIS OWN. LEGISLATIVE BILL WITH THAT LET'S GO AHEAD AND BEGIN -- WITH AGENDA ITEM NUMBER TWO AN OVERVIEW OF OUR FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR. WE HAVE WITH US OUR STATE AUDITOR ELAINE HOWELL HERS A SENIOR AUDITOR AIR AND FELT. THANK YOU GUYS FOR JOINING US WE JUST PROVIDE US A KIND OF AN OVERVIEW OF YOUR FINDINGS AND THEN WE'LL GO FROM THERE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS FOR THE RECORD MY NAME'S ELAINE HOW CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR -- TO MY RIGHT IS MY COLLEAGUE AARON FILM THERE HE WAS THE PROJECT LEAD ON THIS PARTICULAR AUDIT I'M GOING TO GO OVER THE KEY FINDINGS IN THE ARE -- THAT WE COMPLETED IN JANUARY MR FELDER WILL STEP YOU THROUGH THE RECOMMENDATIONS HE HE'S GROUP THEM BY BY SUBJECT MATTER -- AND THEN WE HAVE RECEIVED THIS SIXTY DAY RESPONSE AS I'M SURE ALL THE MEMBERS KNOW WHEN WE ISSUE AN AUDIT REPORT THERE'S AN INITIAL RESPONSE THAT'S INCLUDED IN PUBLISHED WITH THE ACTUAL REPORT. BUT THEN WE EXPECT THE ENTITY WE AUDIT TO FOLLOW UP AND GIVE US PROGRESS. REPORTS ESSENTIALLY AT SIX MONTHS SIXTY DAYS SIX MONTHS IN ONE YEAR SO WE DO HAVE THE SIXTY DAY AND HE WILL BE ABLE TO COMMENT ON OUR REVIEW OF WHAT. CORRECTIONS HAS PROVIDED TO US -- IN ITS RESPONSE AND WHAT WE THINK NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED THINGS WE THINK ARE POSITIVE -- STEPS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- BUT MR FELDER WILL GO OVER THAT SO MY PART OF THE PRESENTATION WILL BE THE KEY FINDINGS IN THE REPORT. SO WE WE TALKED ABOUT THREE DIFFERENT. KEY AREAS IN THE REPORT AND IN YOUR OPENING COMMENTS MEMBERS YOU TOUCHED ON SOME OF IT. THE FIRST SECTION OF THE REPORT REALLY TALKS ABOUT -- THE REHABILITATION PROGRAMS AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE IN. REDUCING RECIDIVISM AND WE ACTUALLY -- IDENTIFIED CONTROL GROUPS WORKED WITH -- STATISTICIAN AND DID AN ANALYSIS OF INMATES WHO HAD BEEN RELEASED AND FISCAL YEAR. FIFTEEN SIXTEEN REASON WE SELECTED THAT YEAR IT'S IT'S SUBSEQUENT TO WHEN CORRECTIONS WAS COLLECTING DATA THAT WAS MORE ACCURATE THAN IN THE PAST WHAT IT ALLOWED US TO DO IS LOOK AT RECIDIVISM JUST TWO YEARS OUT. SO -- IN IN THOSE TWO PARTICULAR YEARS WE IDENTIFIED THAT THE RECIDIVISM RATE ESSENTIALLY WAS THE SAME. FOR INMATES WHO HAD BEEN THROUGH SOME CBT COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY PROGRAMS AND THOSE WHO HAD NOT RECEIVED THAT TYPE OF REHABILITATION -- AND AND ACCESS TO THOSE PARTICULAR PROGRAMS. BOTH AT YEAR ONE AND A YEAR TO YEAR -- ONE THE RECIDIVISM RATE WAS AROUND 1213% FOR BOTH GROUPS AT YEAR TWO IT WAS 2425%. SEEM SURPRISING SO WE SAID WHY IS THAT WHY IS THERE A DIFFERENCE IS IT BECAUSE THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE PROGRAMS NOT NECESSARILY AS AS YOU INDICATED MISTER JONES SAWYER. SO WE LOOKED AT WHAT IS THE METHOD WHAT IS CORRECTIONS DOING TO ENSURE THAT. THE CORRECT THE INMATES WHO HAVE HIGH NEEDS. AND A HIGH RISK OF RECIDIVISM ARE BEING PRIORITIZED AND PLACED IN THOSE PARTICULAR PROGRAMS ARE WE ENSURING THAT THOSE PROGRAMS ARE EVIDENCE BASED THOSE ARE THE BEST PROGRAMS. THAT WE THIS WE AS A STATE SHOULD BE PROVIDING TO THOSE INMATES. AND WHAT WE FOUND IS. FIRST OF ALL -- AND LOOKING AT HOW THEY ARE ASSESSING THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS ASSESSES INMATES COMING IN AND THEY USED THREE DIFFERENT TOOLS AND WE IDENTIFIED THAT SOME OF THOSE TOOLS HAVE NOT BEEN VALIDATED. AS TO AS TO THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IN IDENTIFYING HIGH NEED HIGH RECIDIVISM HADN'T BEEN EVALUATED IN AT LEAST. IN ONE CASE COMPASS WHICH IS ASSESSES -- AN INMATE -- CRIMINAL RECORD LOOKS AT WHAT TYPES OF A COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL PROGRAMS WOULD BE HELPFUL TO THAT INDIVIDUAL. THAT HAD NOT BEEN REASSESSED SINCE. TWENTY TEN AND WHEN THEY'RE ASSESSING IT TWENTY TEN THEY'RE USING DATA THAT'S EVEN OLDER. NOW ANOTHER ANOTHER TOOL THEY USE IS CALL IS A CS ARE RAY. AND THAT REALLY LOOKS OUT THERE IT'S CALLED THE STATUS STATIC RISK ASSESSMENT THAT'S LOOKING AT THE RISK OF RECIDIVISM BUT AGAIN THAT TOOL HAVEN'T BEEN EVALUATED SINCE. TWENTY THIRTEEN AND AGAIN THEY'RE USING DATA THAT'S QUITE OLD SO THESE ASSESSMENT TOOLS COMPASS CS ARE A TAPE IS THEIR ACADEMIC IT'S ARE BASICALLY A TEST OF ACADEMIC BASIC EDUCATION. ARM THAT HAD BEEN REASSESSED AND EVALUATED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO WE HAD A LITTLE BIT MORE CONFIDENCE AND THAT PARTICULAR PROGRAM AND THAT FEEDS INTO. THE TYPES OF ACADEMIC PROGRAMS THAT INMATES WOULD RECEIVE BUT BOTH COMPASS AND CS ARE A HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE REALLY THE APPROPRIATE TOOL TO BE USING. AND ASSESSING INMATES IN DETERMINING WHETHER THEY HAVE HIGH NEEDS AND WHAT TYPES OF PROGRAMS THEY SHOULD BE PLACED IN SO THAT WAS THE FIRST CONCERN THAT WE IDENTIFIED. THE SECOND CONCERN IS WHEN WE ACTUALLY LOOKED AT THE EVIDENCE THAT THE THIS CBT PROGRAMS WE FOUND THAT A VARIETY OF INSTITUTIONS WERE NOT NECESSARILY ENSURING. THAT THE PROGRAMS WERE EVIDENCE BASED -- THERE'S A UP YOU CLEARING HOUSE THAT ACTUALLY HAS AN EX THAT HAS DONE EXTENSIVE RESEARCH ON EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS HAS ESSENTIALLY A CATALOG OF PROGRAMS THAT INSTITUTIONS COULD USE -- AND CORRECTIONS CONTRACTS ACTUALLY REQUIRE VENDORS IS A CONTRACT OUT FOR MOST OF THESE PROGRAMS. TO USE EVIDENCE BASED. CURRICULA. BUT WHAT WE WERE FINDING IS THEY ARE NOT MONITORING WHETHER OR NOT THOSE VENDORS ACTUALLY ARE USING THAT TYPE OF CURRICULA. AND WHAT WE FOUND AT AT TEN OF THE INSTITUTIONS IS. THERE WAS A RANGE BETWEEN A LOW OF THREE OR 4% TO A HIGH OF 22% OF THESE CLASS OR NOT ACTUALLY SECOND. SO WE REVIEWED VENDORS TEN INSTITUTIONS ON AVERAGE ABOUT PROGRAMS WERE NOT EVIDENCE BASED BUT THAT REALLY DID RANGE IT WAS A LOW OF ABOUT 3% TO A HIGH OF AT A PARTICULAR INSTITUTION RJ DONOVAN WERE USING CBT PROGRAMS THAT WERE NOT EVIDENCE BASED SO THERE WASN'T SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE TYPE OF PROGRAM TO BE PROVIDING. TO INMATES WHO HAVE A HIGH NEED FOR THESE TYPES OF SERVICES TO TO YOU KNOW STRENGTHEN THEIR ABILITY FOR WHEN THEY'RE RELEASED TO NOT RESET OF EIGHT AND NOT RETURN TO PRISON. SO WE REALLY HAD CONCERNS ABOUT THAT THOSE EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS CORRECTIONS NOT MONITORING THOSE PARTICULAR PROGRAMS. NOW THEY HIRED UC IRVINE TO ASSIST THEM IN DETERMINING HOW DO WE MANAGE THESE CONTRACTS WHAT TYPES OF THINGS SHOULD WE BE DOING AND FAR AS FAR AS A PROGRAM REVIEW. NOT JUST IDENTIFYING WHETHER IT'S EVIDENCE BASED BUT ACTUALLY GOING OUT AND OBSERVING. US SOME OF THE PROGRAMS SPENDING MORE TIME OUT AT THE INSTITUTIONS INCREASING THE NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS SO THE UC IRVINE HAD A VARIETY OF RECOMMENDATIONS. TO GIVE OUR CORRECTIONS THE OPPORTUNITY GET OUT THERE AND DO A BETTER JOB OF MONITORING THESE VENDORS WHO ARE PROVIDING THESE PROGRAMS. WHEN WE ASKED CORRECTIONS ABOUT THAT THEY THEY INTENDED TO PILOT IT AND STARTED PILOTING -- THIS NEW PROGRAM REVIEW AND A COUPLE OF INSTITUTIONS AND THEY INTEND TO ROLL THAT OUT TO MORE INSTITUTIONS OR OVER THE COMING YEAR THEY THEY INTENDED TO START DOING THAT IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR SO HOPEFULLY WHEN THEY PRESENT. THEY'LL HAVE MORE INFORMATION FOR YOU ABOUT THAT BUT THAT'S A KEY ISSUE IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE PROGRAMS AREN'T ANY GOOD BUT YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE USING THE APPROACH. TYPES OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE GOING TO BENEFIT THE INMATES AND THAT ARE PROVEN PROGRAMS AND EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS HAVE CLEARLY BEEN PROVEN TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING RECIDIVISM SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INSTITUTIONS ARE USING THOSE TYPES OF PROGRAMS. THE SECOND AREA THE REPORT -- TALKS ABOUT PLACEMENT AND DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT THE INSTITUTIONS ARE APPROPRIATELY PRIORITIZING INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE HIGH NEED. AND HIGH RISK A RESET OF A RESET EVADING -- INTO INSTITUTIONS AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THEY ARE NOT DOING THAT -- UNFORTUNATELY WE FOUND THAT IN FIFTY FISCAL YEAR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WE IDENTIFIED TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND INMATES WHO HAD BEEN RELEASED -- WHO HAD MODERATE TO HIGH RISK IN BOTH CATEGORIES HIGH RISK HIGH NEEDS AND HIGH RISK OF RETURNING TO PRESENT RESET EVADING-- BUT OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS ONLY ABOUT 30% TO A REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS OR HAD COMPLETED ANY PORTION OF THOSE PARTICULAR PROGRAMS THERE WAS A HIGH NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS. WHO DIDN'T HAVE HIGH NEEDS OR WHO WERE AT HIGH RISK OF RECIDIVISM RECEIVING CORPS ENDING UP IN SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS SO CORRECTIONS WAS NOT DOING A GOOD JOB AT THE VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS? OF MAKING SURE THAT THEY PUT THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO. REALLY NEEDED THESE PROGRAMS AT THE TOP OF THE LIST AND GAVE THEM PRIORITY TO GET INTO SOME OF THESE THESE COURSES. I'M ANOTHER ISSUE THAT THAT WE HEARD FROM THE DEPARTMENT AND REALLY WAS VALIDATED BY SOME OF THE WORK THAT THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL DOES THEY DO SOME OVERSIGHT OF THE DEPARTMENT CORRECTIONS AS I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE. AND THEY FOUND THAT. YOU KNOW THE VACANCY RATE THEY STILL SUFFER FROM ISSUES RELATED TO TRYING TO HIRE INDIVIDUALS BOTH FOR ACADEMIC AND VOCATIONAL PROGRAMS AS I SAID THERE COGNITIVE BEHVIOR PROGRAMS THEY PRETTY MUCH CONTRACT THAT OUT WITH VENDORS -- BUT FOR ACADEMIC AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION% PROGRAMS THEY CONTINUE TO HAVE. A VACANCY RATES THAT ARE A LITTLE HIGHER THAN THEY THEY BELIEVE WOULD BE BEST -- FOR THE INSTITUTIONS AND FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO MEET THEIR THEIR TARGETS FOR PROVIDING THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS TO THE INMATES -- SO THAT REMAINS AN ISSUE NOW WHAT DID WE HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT ONE OF THE THINGS WE HEAR IS THEY DO HAVE DIFFICULTY IN HIRING INDIVIDUALS. IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS IN CALIFORNIA A CERTAIN INSTITUTIONS AND I'M SURE MEMBERS YOU HAVE HEARD THAT IN THE PAST. THE LAST ISSUE WITH RESPECT -- TO PLACEMENT. IN INTO THESE VARIOUS PROGRAMS IS THE ENROLLMENT RATES. SO THEY HAVE THEY HAVE A GOAL OF PROVIDING AT LEAST 70%. OF THE TARGET POPULATION THESE TYPES OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS BUT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE CAPACITY FOR ACADEMIC PROGRAMS VOTE GET PROGRAMS AND C. B. T. PROGRAMS THEY WERE NOT AT CAPACITY THEY HAD THE BUDGET FOR IT. BUT THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO ENROLL AS MANY INMATES AS THE PROGRAMS WERE PROVIDED -- BUDGET AUTHORITY -- ACADEMIC WAS ABOUT CAPACITY CBT ABOUT 76% INVOKE AT ABOUT 68%. NOW IN ADDITION TO THE HIRING ISSUES SOME OF THE INSTITUTIONS RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT PHYSICAL SPACE -- AT FOLSOM IN PARTICULAR THERE WERE SOME ISSUES RELATED TO THE FACILITIES THEIR WORDS A ROOF THAT NEEDED REPAIR SO THEY WERE HAVING TO SHUT DOWN SO. SOME OF THE COURSES AND SOME OF THE CLASSES WERE NOT AVAILABLE TO INMATES BECAUSE THEY HAD TO INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES. AT RJ DONOVAN THEY TALK TO US ABOUT -- ISSUES THAT THE FIRE MARSHAL REYES WHERE THEIR CLASS CLASS SIZES WERE TOO LARGE SO THEY WERE FORCED TO REDUCE SOME OF THOSE CLASS SIZES. BUT WHEN WE ASK CORRECTIONS OKAY WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES -- OF SOME OF THE RESPONSES WERE RELATIVELY SHORT THEY HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT WHAT THEY NEEDED TO DO TO INCREASE YOU KNOW PHYSICAL CAPACITY IN ADDITION TO THE HIRING -- ISSUES THAT I JUST SPOKE ABOUT A LITTLE BIT AGO. NOW ON THE POSITIVE SIDE AS YOU SAID MISTER JONES SAWYER WE LOOKED AT CAL PIAA AND THEIR THEIR RECIDIVISM RATE IS QUITE LOW I MEAN IT WAS ASSESSED BACK IN JULY OF TWENTY ELEVEN AND IT WAS AT 7% -- BUT CALPE CALPE I ATE THEIR ENROLLMENT RATES WERE RELATIVELY LOW WHEN WE LOOKED AT THEM WAS ABOUT 48%. SO WE TALK TO THEM ABOUT THAT AND AND WHAT THEIR RESPONSE TO US WAS. THEY WEREN'T NECESSARILY AND I'LL USE MY TERMINOLOGY IN THE ROOM WHEN DECISIONS WERE MADE ABOUT ASSIGNING INMATES -- TO EITHER REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS ARE PRO OR JOBS IN THE INSTITUTIONS AND AND CAL P. I. A.'S SAYING WE NEED TO BE PART OF THAT DECISION MAKING PROCESS BECAUSE THEN WE CAN INCREASE THE ENROLLMENT. AND SOME OF THE PROGRAM -- THAT WE HAVE AND THAT HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL -- WITH RESPECT -- TO INMATES WHO ARE RELEASED TO GET GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT AND DO NOT RESET AVE IT'S A VERY LOW PERCENTAGE AND AND THEY INTEND TO HAVE AN UPDATE OF THEIR ANALYSIS ON RECIDIVISM IN MAY OF THIS YEAR -- AND HOPEFULLY IT'S RELATIVELY CLOSE TO TO PASS PERFORMANCE NOW THERE HAS BEEN. A PILOT PROGRAM THAT HAS BEEN STARTED -- BY CAL P. I. A AND WERE WORKING WITH CORRECTIONS WORK CAL P. I. A IS NOW PART OF THAT DECISION MAKING PROCESS. AND WE'RE SEEING INCREASING ENROLLMENT AND SOME OF THE CAL PI AIR PROGRAMS IT INCREASED FROM JULY THIS PILOT JUST STARTED THIS LAST YEAR -- IN IN JULY IT INCREASE IT WAS AT 44% AND IT WENT UP 253% IN OCTOBER OF EIGHTEEN SO HOPEFULLY THIS PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE -- TO ALLOW AND ENCOURAGE INMATES TO ENROLL IN SOME OF THE P. I. A PROGRAMS AND WHERE THEY CAN REALLY GAIN SOME. SOME -- AND VALUABLE SKILLS -- UPON YOU KNOW PRIOR TO THE RELEASE OFF FROM THE INSTITUTIONS. THE LAST SECTION IS RELATED TO OVERSIGHT PERFORMANCE MEASURES METRICS THOSE SORTS OF THINGS AND AGAIN THIS IS ANOTHER AREA WHERE THE DEPARTMENT CORRECTIONS IS FALLING SHORT WE WEREN'T SEEING A LOTS OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES. ARE DEVELOPED WE ACTUALLY LOOKED AT WHAT SOME OTHER STATES WERE DOING THE STATE OF MINNESOTA ACTUALLY RECEIVE SOME FEDERAL MONEY THERE'S A FEDERAL GRANT. THAT'S AVAILABLE TO STATES CALLED STATEWIDE RECIDIVISM REDUCTION GRANT THE STATE OF MINNESOTA PUT TOGETHER SOME METRICS AND SOME GOALS FOR REDUCING RECIDIVISM -- THEIR FIRST CALL WAS TO REDUCE IT BY THREE I THINK IT WAS AROUND 3% AND THEY RECEIVED A THREE MILLION DOLLAR GRANT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. TO BASICALLY ENHANCE SOME OF THEIR PROGRAMS TO REALLY FOCUS ON COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY PROVIDING. SERVICES TO INMATES IN IN THE STATE OF MINNESOTA TO HOPEFULLY REDUCE THAT RECIDIVISM RATE AND THEIR STATE AS WELL. BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT WE BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT CORRECTIONS REALLY NEEDS TO DEVELOP METRICS. FOR HOW MANY INMATES DO THEY WANT TO ENROLL IN THESE PARTICULAR -- PROGRAMS WHAT ABOUT COMPLETION RATES YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO HAVE A 100% COMPLETION BUT YOU'VE GOT TO SET YOURSELF SOME GOALS. FOR GETTING. THE CORRECT INMATES WHO HAVE HIGH NEEDS AND HIGHER AND HIGHER RISK A RESET OF AIDING INTO THE PROGRAMS -- AND REALLY MEASURE AGAINST HOW SUCCESSFUL YOU ARE DOING THAT. NOW THEY THEY DEPARTMENT TALK TO US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- COORDINATING AND WORKING WITH EXTERNAL RESEARCHERS TO CONDUCT A PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF THEIR PROGRAMS FROM A COST EFFECTIVENESS STANDPOINT AND LOOKING AT A DEVELOPING METRICS ETCETERA THAT WAS DURING DURING THE AUDIT ITSELF -- BUT ALTHOUGH THEY HAD DONE THAT BY THE TIME WE HAD COMPLETED OUR FIELD WORK THEY REALLY HADN'T TAKEN ANY FORMAL STEPS. ARE TO INITIATE THE PROCESS THAT'S WHY WE FELT THE LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATION -- AND WE'VE SEEN THE BILLS -- THAT THAT ARE ARE OUT THERE A LOOKING AT CARRYING OUT SOME OF OUR IMPLEMENTING SOME OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND AND WE WERE WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE THAT BECAUSE WE THINK THAT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT NEEDS TO HAPPEN -- BUT WE HAVE NOT SEEN MUCH PROGRESS WITH RESPECT TO THAT -- THE ALSO THE THE DEPARTMENT CORRECTIONS HADN'T ANALYZE WHETHER OR NOT THERE PROGRAMS WERE REDUCING RECIDIVISM -- THEY DID CONTRACT WITH UC IRVINE AGAIN TO EXAMINE WAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR C. B. T. CLASSES WERE UNIFORMED AND WERE BEING PRESENTED. AND ANY UNIFORMED MANNER THEY TALK ABOUT PROGRAM FIDELITY AND THERE HAS BEEN RESEARCH DONE AS FAR AS PROGRAM FIDELITY IF THESE PROGRAMS ARE REALLY TRULY EVIDENCE BASED. AND ARE BEING PROVIDED TO INDIVIDUALS ARE INMATES IN THE INSTITUTIONS CONSISTENTLY THEN YOU WILL REALLY HAVE POSITIVE OUTCOMES SO YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE USING EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS YOUR YOUR ADMINISTERING THOSE PROGRAMS CONSISTENTLY BECAUSE THEN WHEN YOU MEASURE YOU CAN GET A TRUE. ARE TRUE IDEA OF HOW SUCCESSFUL -- THE PROGRAMS ARE AND MAKE. INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE TO CONTINUE TO INVEST FUNDS OR WHERE TO PERHAPS PULL FUNDS BACK AND AND SHIFT TO THE MORE SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS BUT THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN -- UC IRVINE ACTUALLY PROVIDED A REPORT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS IN JUNE OF EIGHTEEN AT WEST BASICALLY CAME UP WITH A CHECKLIST AND A WAY FOR CORRECTIONS TO IDENTIFY. THE CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE BOARD AND THAT PROGRAM FIDELITY WHEN CORRECTIONS -- TALK TO US ABOUT THAT WE QUESTION THEM ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT. THEY ASSERTED TO US THAT THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO DO THAT UNTIL THE BEGINNING OF THIS NEXT FISCAL YEAR A NINETEEN BY JULY OF OF NINETEEN LATER THIS YEAR -- THEY'VE HAD THE REPORT AS I SAID FROM IRVINE. AS AS FAR BACK AS JUNE OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO AGAIN A LITTLE BIT OF CONCERN THERE WHERE WE NEED TO BE MAKING BETTER PROGRESS STRONGER PROGRESS IN SOME OF THESE AREAS. ON THE LAST COUPLE OF ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO PROGRAMS IS FALLEN VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS AND A LOT OF THESE DO GET ATTENTION. CERTAINLY FROM THE MEDIA BECAUSE THEY'RE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROGRAMS AS FAR AS A HORSE THERAPY IN THOSE SORTS OF THINGS THEY HAVE A HUGE NUMBER OF THESE PROGRAMS -- THAT CAN BE VERY BENEFICIAL AGAIN THE PROBLEM IS THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS HAS NOT ASSESSED THE THE SUCCESS OF THESE PROGRAMS THERE ARE A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS ARE INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN THESE PROGRAMS. CERTAINLY BECAUSE PART OF THE BENEFIT TO THEM IS SOME OF THEIR SENTENCES REDUCED IF THEY THEY PARTICIPATE IN COMPLETE SOME OF THESE VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS. BUT THE IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN CORRECTIONS. INVESTED ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THESE PROGRAMS HAD ON AVERAGE ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND INMATES PARTICIPATING IN THESE PROGRAMS WHERE THEY FELL SHORT IS THEY HAVEN'T ASSESSED THESE PARTICULAR PROGRAMS HOW SUCCESSFUL HAVE THEY BEEN -- IN AND HELPING INMATES WITH ANGER MANAGEMENT WITH OTHER TYPES OF OUR CHARACTERISTICS THAT THEY NEED TO WORK ON TO MAKE THEM -- MORE SUCCESSFUL WHEN THEY ARE RELEASED FROM PRISON -- CORRECTIONS DID. INFORM US THAT THEY INTENDED TO PARTNER WITH PP I SEE BUT AGAIN WHEN WE FINISHED OUR FIELD WORK ON IT LATE LAST YEAR IN NOVEMBER DECEMBER AT THAT POINT THEY HADN'T REACHED ANY AGREEMENT WITH PP I SEE RELATED TO THE SCOPE OF THE REVIEW. HOW THEY WOULD GO ABOUT REVIEWING THESE VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS AND WE THINK IT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THOSE PROGRAMS BE ASSESSED AS WELL AS? THE EVIDENCE BASED OTHER TYPES OF PROGRAMS BECAUSE IN CONJUNCTION THEY COULD BE VERY BENEFICIAL TO INMATES. IN THE VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS. AND THEN THE LAST PIECE IS LOOKING WE LOOKED AT SEE ROB -- WHICH I'M SURE YOU'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THAT REHABILITATIVE OVERSIGHT BOARD THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AND THE BENEFITS THAT THEY COULD PROVIDE -- IN MONITORING REHAB PROGRAM PERFORMANCE REQUIRING CORRECTIONS TO REPORT BACK TO THEM OVERSEEING AN EXTERNAL RESEARCHER AT WE TALK ABOUT IN OUR RECOMMENDATIONS -- BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE THAT RESPONSIBILITY AND WE THINK THAT COULD PLAY A VERY VERY IMPORTANT ROLE. IN ASSESSING THE SUCCESS OF THESE PARTICULAR PROGRAMS AND THE PROGRESS THAT CORRECTIONS HAS OR HAS NOT MADE -- AS WE MOVE FORWARD. IN IN HOPEFULLY IMPLEMENTING SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE IN THE REPORT AND IMPROVING THE THE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS IN OUR INSTITUTIONS. SO WITH THAT MEMBERS I WILL TURN IT OVER TO MR FELDER AND HE'LL GO THROUGH -- THAT THE CATEGORIES OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MADE WE DID TALK ABOUT A THREE YEAR PLAN. WITH RESPECT TO HIRING AT AN EXTERNAL RESEARCHER REPORTING BACK AND THEN CONTINUING TO MONITOR BUT I'LL HAND IT OFF TO MISTER FILNER. AND HE CAN TAKE IT FROM HERE THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON -- OF THE FOURTEEN RECOMMENDATIONS DIRECTED THE CDC ARE IT IS STILL IN THE PLANNING STAGES FOR IMPLEMENTING THIRTEEN OF THOSE AND HAS PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED. ONE SO SPECIFICALLY WE RECOMMENDED THAT CDC ARE RE VALIDATE COMPASS AND CS ARE A THAT IS THE MEASURE THAT MEASURES AND INMATES REHABILITATIVE NEEDS AS WELL AS THEIR RISK -- IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP THESE TOOLS ACCURATE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED TO ASSESS THE CORRECTLY BUT ALSO ANY TIME THE INMATE DEMOGRAPHICS CHANGE THOSE TOOLS COULD BECOME AN ACCURATE AND WE'VE SEEN A BIG CHANGE IN THE WAY POPULATION SINCE REALIGNMENT -- FOR EXAMPLE -- IN TWENTY TEN FOR CRIMES AGAINST PEOPLE'S THE NUMBER OF INMATES CONVICTED OF THOSE CRIMES IN A AND INSTITUTIONALIZED WAS 56% OF THE POPULATION. NOW IT'S SEVENTY NINE SO YOU SEE A BIG JOB THAT MEANS YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THESE TOOLS ARE STILL ACCURATELY ASSESSING INMATES. CCIR HAS A TEAM WORKING ON A SCHEDULE AND IS RE ABOUT TO RETALIATE THE TOOLS AND THAT SCHEDULE SHOULD BE AVAILABLE SOMETIME THIS MONTH. SO OTHER MAKING PROGRESS THERE AT LEAST TO GET A SCHEDULE GOING FOR THAT RETALIATION WE ALSO RECOMMENDED THAT CDC ARE AMEND ITS CONTRACTS TO ENSURE THE VENDORS WERE ONLY USING -- EVIDENCE BASED FOR THEIR CBT I CURRICULA. AS DESIGNATED BY PEW -- CDC ARE HAS. SO FAR RIDE REVISED ITS TEMPLATE FOR THE CONTRACT FOR THE SCOPE OF WORK TO MANDATE ONLY EVIDENCE BASED CURRICULUM NOW THAT SHOULD BE IN YOU SOMETIME NEXT MONTH AND THAT'LL BE USED AN ONGOING BASIS SO ANYTIME THEY NEED TO MAKE TO CONTRACTS WITH THE VENDORS. NOW THEIR RESPONSE DID NOT INCLUDE ANY MENTION OF ANY OVERSIGHT MECHANISM SO HOW THEY'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY ENSURE THAT. THESE EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES ARE EVIDENCE BASED CRIGLER USED SO WE'RE STILL WAITING ON THAT. IN ADDITION WE RECOMMENDED THAT A PRIORITIZE INMATES APPROPRIATELY AND IT UPDATE IT'S WAIT LIST SYSTEM -- THIS MONTH CDC OR IS PLANNING ON IMPLEMENTING A WEIGHTLESS SYSTEM THAT PRIORITIZES INMATES BASED ON THE REHABILITATIVE NEEDS AND RISKS SO ONCE WE SEE THAT AND THEN THE SIX MONTH. RESPONSE PERIOD IN JULY WILL HOPEFULLY GET SOME EVIDENCE THAT IN FACT THAT NEW WEIGHTLESS SYSTEM IS ACTUALLY SHOWING A COMPASS AND CS SORRY SCORES. AND THEN ACTUALLY SLIDING INMATES NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE ON A SIGN FOR BECAUSE THEY HAVE HIGH NEED TO THE RISKS -- IS ALSO PLANNING ON GIVING ADDITIONAL TRAINING -- AND WE'LL BE DISTRIBUTING GUIDANCE TO CORRECTIONAL COUNSELORS THOSE THE ONES THAT ACTUALLY ASSIGN THE INMATES INTO THE PROGRAMS -- WE RECOMMENDED THAT CDC OUR PARTNER WITH THE RESEARCH ORGANIZATION TO CONDUCT AN EVALUATION OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS INCLUDING VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS DOT IN FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY SO NEXT FISCAL YEAR WE WANTED THEM TO BE DRAFTING THE SCOPE OF WORK IN CONTRACTING. THAT WAY -- IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE VENDOR CAN ACTUALLY ARE THE CONTRACTOR COULD DO THAT WORK THAT OUTSIDE RESEARCH ORGANIZATION -- CCR IS HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH AN EXTERNAL ORGANIZATION AND ANTICIPATE HAVING A FORMAL CONTRACT AND SCOPE OF WORK COMPLETED BY APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY NOW THAT IS WITHIN OUR TIME FRAME OF FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY HOWEVER WE'D LIKE TO SEE THE SCOPE OF WORK COMPLETED AND POLICE TO RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS. EARLIER SO WE COULD SEE EXACTLY WHAT -- WHAT THAT WORK WITH A TAIL BEFORE ANY CONTRACT IS FINALIZED? NOW -- THERE ARE SOME AREAS WHERE WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY NOTABLE PROGRESS -- FOR EXAMPLE WE RECOMMENDED THAT CDC OR CREATE A PLAN TO MEET ITS STAFFING GOALS AND MONITOR THOSE -- EFFORTS NOW CDC ARE DOES HAVE MECHANISMS TO MONITOR THE VACANCY RATES OF ITS STAFF AND ALL OF ITS INSTITUTIONS ON A MONTHLY BASIS THAT'S GOOD. BUT IT STILL HAS A YET TO DEVELOP ANY PLAN TO ENSURE THAT IT MEETS THOSE STAFFING GOALS ESPECIALLY INSTITUTIONS WHERE THEY'VE HAD VACANCIES IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION FOR YEARS. AND THE OF THESE ARE THE SPOTS ARE SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO FILL BECAUSE OF THE GEOGRAPHY WORTH PRISONS LOCATED SO DOES GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE EXTRA ATTENTION AND ON CORRECTIONS BEHALF ACTUALLY GET PEOPLE IN THERE. AND SO WE'D LIKE TO SEE THAT PLAN DEVELOPED. IN ADDITION CDC OURS YET TO DEVELOP ANY PROGRAM TARGETS OR METRICS FOR ITS REBUILT ASIAN PROGRAMS. THAT THOSE WOULD INCLUDE SAY THE YOU KNOW THE PERCENTAGE OF INMATES AND ROLLED AND REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS THE PERCENTAGE THE COMPLETE WE'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT YOU KNOW WHERE WE'RE TO SEE TO SEE I THINK THAT. THAT NUMBER SHOULD BE AS WELL AS YOU KNOW EVENTUALLY WITH THE HOW WELL THESE PROGRAMS ARE ACTUALLY REDUCING RECIDIVISM. AND SETTING GOALS THERE. FINALLY -- ONE REASON IN ME TO ROLL MADE. IN THESE CLASSES WAS LOW -- CITIES ARE IDENTIFIED AS SPACE LIMITATIONS. SO -- WE RECOMMENDED THAT CDC ARE PREPARE REPORT ON ITS CURRENT SPACE YOU KNOW WHAT WAIT WHERE DID IT NEED TO ADD MORE AND HOW MUCH WOULD THAT COST TO PRESENT TO THE LEGISLATURE. CDC ARE STATED THAT IT WOULD NOT HAVE A FUNDING REQUEST READY UNTIL FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SETS OVER THREE AND A HALF YEARS FROM NOW -- WE THINK THAT THEY CAN SB THAT UP A LOT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THESE IN ROMAN NUMBERS AT THE MAXIMUM BUDGET CAPACITY UNLESS YOU HAVE THE SPACE FOR IT SO THE SOONER YOU GET THAT SPACE THE SOONER YOU CAN ACTUALLY GET MORE. INMATES WHO NEED THAT -- RESULTED OF PROGRAMMING. AND WELL WE'LL BE FOLLOWING UP WITH CDC ARE AT SIX MONTH AND ONE YEAR FROM REPORT ISSUANCE. AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT APPRECIATE THAT OVERVIEW I THINK THERE WAS A LOT IN THERE AND THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS FOR THE NEXT PANEL. BASED OFF OF YOUR INFORMATION BUT LET ME JUST ASK A GENERAL FIRST QUESTION MAYBE YOU KNOW BECAUS WE READ THE HEADLINES AND YOU MENTIONED -- MADAM AUDITOR THE THE HEADLINES THAT WE'VE BEEN READING OUT IN THE MEDIA ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO CORRECTIONS ON WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE BEING EFFECTIVE -- THAT A FAIR ASSESSMENT IN YOUR VIEW BECAUSE I THINK YOU POINTED OUT SOME OF THE PROGRAMS AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE LOOKED AT BUT YOU KNOW I ALSO LOOKED AT THE AUDITED I FOUND THINGS LIKE FOR INSTANCE SATISFIED IN CORCORAN IN MY AREA. SEEM TO BE DO AND AN OKAY JOB IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL RECIDIVISM. I MEAN CAN YOU TALK TO THE PARENTS OF WHICH PROGRAMS THAT YOU SOLVE PROBABLY ARE WORKING BUT THEN MAYBE WE ASK QUESTION WHY AREN'T THOSE BEING REPLICATED EVEN IF. IT'S ALREADY IN THE SYSTEM AND SOMETHING THAT'S ACTUALLY WORKING COMPARED TO SOME OF THESE OTHERS WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE THE METRICS OF THE ANALYTICS TO ACTUALLY SHOW. ANY PROGRESSION OR TOWARDS REDUCING THE RECIDIVISM RATE. WELL I I THINK I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS AT A FIRST PLEASE THAT'S THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT FACILITY. AND YOU THAT WAS NOT ONE OF THE PRISONS WHERE WE CONDUCTED AN IN DEPTH REVIEW THAT WAS ENERGY DOT OF IN SYNC WONDERFUL SOME BUT WE DID HAVE A CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH THE ADMINISTRATOR THERE -- AND HE INDICATED THAT THAT SEVERAL THINGS KIND OF SET THAT PROGRAM APART FROM OTHER FACILITIES AT CDC OURS PRISONS SPECIFICALLY -- THEY OFFERED INCENTIVE PROGRAM SO IF YOU STATE ON TRACK WITH YOUR PROGRAMMING -- YOU THERE WERE INCENTIVES IN IN MAY COULD RECEIVE SUCH AS HAVING AS SOLO SELL -- AND IN ADDITION -- HE INDICATED THERE WAS KIND OF IMMERSIVE CBT ENVIRONMENT WHERE YOU WERE HOUSED WITH PEOPLE ALL TAKEN THE SAME COURSES AT THE SAME TIME. AND THAT REALLY THAT WAS MUCH MORE CONDUCIVE -- TO HAVING MORE INMATES COMPLETE THE PROGRAM -- WITH WHATEVER THE PROGRAM A. B. -- HOWEVER IF YOU NEED MORE DETAILS ON CAN THE PAST OR CURRENT PRACTICES AT SAD IF I'M SURE CITIES HERE CAN PROVIDE YOU MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ON THAT -- AND I I SHE TO THE SECOND PART YOUR QUESTION RELATED TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAMS AND BY. SO WHAT WE DID FIND WAS THAT. WE FOCUSED ON C. B. T. BECAUSE ITS THE NEWEST SUITE OF PROGRAMMING OFFERED BY CORRECTIONS AND ALSO THAT. YOU KNOW 70% OF THE BUDGET AND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN WHEN THEY DID MAKE THAT BIG EXPANSIVE EFFORT TO INCREASE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING 70% OF THAT WAS TARGETED CBT. SO IT ME ALTHOUGH IT MAKES UP ONLY ABOUT 25% OF THE INMATES -- AVAILABLE SLOTS FOR REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING WE FELT THAT THAT WAS THE HIGHEST RISK POPULATION TO GO AFTER. AND YOU KNOW ALTHOUGH OUR PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS FOUND THAT WILL THAN TWO YEARS RECIDIVISM REALLY DIDN'T CHANGE THAT MUCH. FOR US TO DRIVE TRIGGERED YOU KNOW -- KIND OF A TWO FOLD IDEA THAT ONE THERE NEEDS TO BE A MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS CONDUCTED. TO SEE OKAY WHAT IS WORKING WHAT ISN'T IMPROVE BETWEEN ALL THE PROGRAMS NOT JUST C. B. T. AND WITH THREE YEAR ANALYSIS OF ALL THREE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING -- AND THEN YOU CAN START MAKING DECISIONS ON WHAT'S EFFECTIVE WHAT ISN'T BASED ON THAT ANALYSIS BECAUSE OURS OBVIOUSLY IS THE FLAG TO GOES UP THAT SAYS YOU NEED TO DO MORE WORK HERE. I THINK SECONDLY IT YOU KNOW IT SAYS THE CDC ARE THAT. THERE'S WAYS -- THAT YOU COULD ADMINISTER THESE PROGRAMS BETTER THAT IN FACT THE POOR MINISTRATION IS LIMITING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE PROGRAMS AND THAT WITH YOU KNOW -- PRIORITIZING THE WEIGHTLESS ISSUE -- THE EVIDENCE BASED ISSUE OF YOU KNOW YOU FIX THESE YOU FIX THESE ADMINISTRATIVE AREAS YOU COULD SEE -- BETTER RESULTS. THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION. YES THANK YOU. LET ME OPEN IT UP LET ME ASK THERE'S ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. MISTER JONES SAWYER. SO -- YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE -- WE PUT IN THIS CONTEXT IS THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION OF EVIDENCE BASED I KIND OF WANT TO GET YOUR YOUR DEFINITION OF IT -- BECAUSE WHEN I WHEN I SPEAK TO INDIVIDUALS AND I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE WHEN TIM ROBBINS CAME INTO MY OFFICE TO TALK ABOUT. THE THE ACTORS GANG. ANY HAD TO INDIVIDUALS -- WHO HAD GONE TO HIS PROGRAM AND ED NOT WE SHOULD HAVE AIDED IN A YEAR. ARMY LOOK ME STRAIGHT IN THE EYE AND SAID WE'RE NOT AN EVIDENCE BASED. PROGRAM. AND I'M I'M SITTING THERE GOING. I LOOK AT ONE PERSON HERE. L. ONE PERSON THERE. THAT WE NO LONGER HAVE TO SPEND EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. IN MY MIND. THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT WE JUST SAVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HUNDRED SIXTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR BECAUSE THESE TWO INDIVIDUALS DID NOT. WE SHOULD HAVE A BECAUSE OF THE WAY WE THINK OF BANKS. BY THE WAY WE CALCULATED A NO DISRESPECT TO THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE SORT OF FINANCE OR TO THE LA OWES IN THE OF THE WORLD ANY OTHER. PENCIL PUSHERS THEY HAVE A THEY HAVE A WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS THAT MAY NOT HELP. US ACTUALLY. DO EVIDENCE BASED. AND THEN IT ALSO MEAN NO DISRESPECT TO ACADEMICS IS SPECIALLY UCI BUT THEY MAY HAVE SOME IDEA OF WHAT IT IS. BUT WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS. YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GET THAT EVIDENCE BASED ON THE FRONT END BUT YOU MAY BE ABLE TO GET IT ON ON THE BACK IN THE SAME WAY WITH -- THERE'S A PROGRAM [inaudible] THAT -- A MAJOR TRAINING -- SERVICE DOGS SERVICE ANIMALS. AND THEN THEY GIVE OUT TO PEOPLE WHO NEED THEM. BUT THEY ALSO FOUND THAT INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THAT PROGRAM -- THE NUMBER OF INCIDENTS THAT THEY'RE INVOLVED IN VIOLENCE. DRUG OFFENSES BEING ON DRUGS -- HAVE GONE WAY DOWN AND I AND AND I AND I ASKED THE THE SECRETARY. WE KINDA HAD OF JUST A QUICK CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT AND HE SAID YOU KNOW EVERY TIME WE WRITE A REPORT ABOUT AN INCIDENT. THAT'S LIKE A THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND IF THERE'S LIKE [inaudible] NINETEEN HUNDRED A YEAR. IN ONE FACILITY THAT'S ONE POINT NINE MILLION. IF YOU COULD REDUCE THAT DOWN SIGNIFICAN THAT'S ANOTHER SAVINGS AND THAT COULD BE SOMETHING YOU COULD USE TO SAY. YOU KNOW THIS PROGRAM WERE SOMEBODY THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE MORE HARD KNOWS ABOUT REHABILITATION. THEY MAY LAUGH AT THAT PROGRAMS LIKE THAT. WE COULD ACTUALLY SHOW THAT IT WORKS BUT IT MAY NOT FIT IN HIS BOX. CALLED EVIDENCE BASED SO I KIND OF WANT TO GET YOUR TAKE. ON EVIDENCE BASED BECAUSE FOR ME. STOP IT IT COULD BE. IF WE ALL SAT IN REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT -- AND I MAYBE WE NEED TO ELIMINATE THIS TERM EVIDENCE BASE AND TALK ABOUT RETURN ON INVESTMENT. R. A WHY THAT MIGHT GET US. TO A BETTER PLACE OF OF OF GETTING MORE MONEY GETTING MORE. MORE SKEPTICAL MEMBERS IN THE ASSEMBLY -- INVOLVED IN THIS. SO FAR IT'S RESPOND I THINK THE BATTERY ME THE CLINICAL DEFINITION OF EVIDENCE BASED OKAY GOT IT. THAT'S ALL -- WE WE'VE GOT A WE'VE DIVIDED IS SIMPLY -- PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN PROVEN THROUGH RESEARCH TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM BUT WE'RE ONLY SPEAKING TO THAT OF THE CVT PROGRAM SO THAT'S JUST FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS CRIMINOLOGICAL THINKING SUBSTANCE ABUSE -- AND ANGER MANAGEMENT SO THAT THAT'S KIND OF ITS BOX OVER HERE THERE'S THERE'S HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF OTHER PROGRAMS THAT CDC ARE OFFERS THEIR VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS THAT NEED TO BE STUDIED AND THOSE. THE YOU KNOW IT ENTITIES -- IT OUTSIDE RESEARCH ORGANIZATION CAN KIND OF LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE -- IN QUALITY OR PROGRAMS AND SAY OKAY WE OF BASED ON THE EVEN A SMALL SAMPLE SIZE THIS THIS WORKS A COULD BE SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO OTHER INSTITUTIONS. WE THINK THAT THAT WORK SHOULD BE DONE SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY EVIDENCE BASED FOR EVERYBODY BUT WE DO THINK THAT YOU NEED TO LOOK AT YOU KNOW X. AMOUNT OF INDIVIDUALS WHO LEFT IN TAKEN THIS. PARTICULAR VOLUNTEER PROGRAM WOULD HAVE BEEN THE RESULTS OF THAT. SO DON'T NECESSARILY EVIDENCE BASED BUT SIMPLY JUST -- YOU KNOW. AND I'M LOOKING AT THE OUTCOMES. RIGHT MISTER JONES ARE THE WAY AND I APPRECIATE AARON'S ANSWER I THINK WHAT WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT IS. WE DON'T NEED JUST ONE PARTICULAR TYPE OF PROGRAM WHICH IS C. B. T. EVIDENCE BASE THERE ARE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THERE'S ACADEMIC THERE'S VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. AND THERE'S A VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS AND LET'S NOT JUST DISMISS THOSE OTHER PROGRAMS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT EVIDENCE BASED WE WOULD ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH THAT AND THAT'S WHY WE DISCUSSED IN THE REPORT. BOTH ACADEMIC AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND THE ISSUES THERE WITH RESPECT TO THEY HAVE MORE BUDGET CAPACITY THEY MIGHT NEED TO HIRE MORE INDIVIDUALS TO PROVIDE THOSE TYPES OF THE ACADEMIC TRAINING FOR IT FOR INDIVIDUALS TO GET THEIR READING LEVEL UP AT CETERA. VOCATIONAL EDUCATION ALLOWED THE FOLK AT WORK THAT IS DONE AND CAL PA A IS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL. WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING IS IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE CBT PROGRAMS THEY RESEARCH PROVES THAT THE EVIDENCE THE MOST EFFECTIVE CBT PROGRAMS ARE THOSE THAT ARE EVIDENCE BASED? THAT IS NOT TO SUGGEST THAT THESE VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS LIKE YOU SAID SERVICE DOGS WE TALK ABOUT HORSE THERAPY AND SOME PEOPLE MAY SAY OUT. YOU KNOW WHY ARE YOU PROVIDING THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS INDIVIDUALS WELL IT IT'S LOOKING OUT OF THE INDIVIDUAL AN INMATE. FROM A HOLISTIC PERSPECTIVE AND IF A HORSE THERAPY PROGRAM IS GOING TO SUGGEST THAT INDIVIDUAL AND WE'VE EVALUATED AND DETERMINED THAT IT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN REDUCING -- INCIDENTS IN THE INSTITUTION ANGER MED ADDRESSED ANGER MANAGEMENT THOSE SORTS OF THINGS TEACHING DISCIPLINE ETCETERA LET'S CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THOSE PROGRAMS SO. I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO CONCLUDE FROM OUR REPORT THAT. THERE ARE PROGRAMS IN THE INSTITUTIONS THAT IF THEY'RE NOT EVIDENCE BASED THEY SHOULD BE TOSSED THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING WE ARE SUGGESTING IF YOU'RE GONNA USE THESE COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT PROGRAMS. THE RESEARCH SHOWS EVIDENCE BASED THIRD THAT. YOU WORK THE BEST LET'S CONTINUE TO SUPPORT OUR OUR VOLUNTEER PRO BONTA EERIE PROGRAMS BUT LET'S ASSESS THOSE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WORK IF THEY DO WORK AND MANY OF THEM I WOULD ASSUME DUE. OUT LET'S CONTINUE TO INVEST IN THAT AND THEN LET'S ALSO ASSESS OUR ACADEMIC AND VOCATIONAL SO I THINK IT'S A COMBINATION OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROGRAMS BUT AS WE INDICATED IN THE REPORT CORRECTIONS NEEDS TO EVALUATE. FIRST OF ALL EVALUATE YOUR ASSESSMENT TOOLS BECAUSE THE THE POPULATION HAS CHANGED THE TOOLS HAVEN'T BEEN VALIDATED FOR A YOU KNOW NEARLY A DECADE SOME OF THE DATA THEY'VE USED TO VALIDATE SOME OF THESE. ASSESSMENT TOOLS IS IS BACK FAR AS 200-022-0003 THAT'S TOO OLD -- AND SO. THERE'S A VARIETY OF THINGS THAT DEPARTMENT CORRECTIONS NEEDS TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR CONDUCT IN THE APPROPRIATE SETTLEMENTS AND THEN GIVING THOSE INMATES THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROGRAMS EITHER. CVT PROGRAMS OR VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS OR A COMBINATION OF MULTIPLE PROGRAMS SO THAT THAT INMATE IS GIVEN THE BEST OPPORTUNITY BE SUCCESSFUL WHEN HE OR SHE IS RELEASED FROM. FROM PRISON IN CALIFORNIA. AND IN THE REAL REASON I ASKED THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S KEY TO WHAT WE ALL NEED ABOUT EVIDENCE BASED AND AND EVEN. THE DEPARTMENT I WANT THEM. TO TO OPEN UP THEIR MINDS AND BE. INVENTIVE IF THEY HAVE TO TO TO DO THAT I MEAN WHEN I ASKED. HOW DO YOU KNOW? SOMEONE HAS A MISTER DAVID DATE OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS AYE AYE SOME KIND OF WE GET AN ANSWER WE DON'T KNOW. AND I WOULD SAY WHAT. DEAR IS A WAY YOU CAN CALCULATE THAT NAY SAID HOW I SAID WELL YOU GO. TO THE STATE FRANCHISE BOARD AND SEE HOW MANY HAVE PAID TAXES OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. I'M PRETTY SURE UNLESS THEY'RE REALLY GOOD CRIMINALS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO WORK NINE TO FIVE EVERY DAY. MONDAY TO FRIDAY AND TAKE CARE TO KIDS OR WEAKENED IF THEY AND ARE PAYING TAXES THEY GOT A HOUSE NOTE THERE. THERE'S A THERE'S A HIGH PERCENTAGE THAT THEY'RE NOT DOING CRIME AGAIN. AND IS PROBABLY 1100% CHANCE THAT IF THEY'RE GOING TO WORK EVERY DAY DURING THOSE FIVE YEARS THEY DID NOT. RECEIVE A VAGUE. SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY SHOW THAT THE SAVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR SO OVER. FOR FIVE YEARS TAKES A A HALF A MILLION THEY GOT A THOUSAND PEOPLE DOING THAT. NOW YOU CAN SHOW. A REAL NUMBER. AND THEY SAID WELL WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET A FROM THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD OR WERE PRECLUDED OR IS IT. YOU'RE LOOKING AT SOMEONE I CAN CHANGE THE LAW. SO DID YOU ASK AND SO I THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING THE DEPARTMENT. GET ON BOARD THIS WILL ONLY HELP YOU IN AND AND THAT'S WHY SAID MAYBE I NEED TO CHANGE. DO LEGISLATION TO CHANGE EVIDENCE BASED TO RETURN ON INVESTMENT BECAUSE THAT MIGHT GET PEOPLE TO REALLY. LOOK AT THIS WHOLE THING ABOUT MAKING SURE THE PROGRAMS WORK BECAUSE THIS. IS BENEFICIAL AND I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION AS I GOT PEOPLE. SO THIS IS MORE BECAUSE I'M A BUDGET. AND PUT IN I USED TO BE DIRECTOR OF REAL ESTATE FOR THE CITY AND THE WHOLE FACILITIES -- JUST DISCUSSION I AGREE WITH YOU YOU WE NEED TO HAVE SOME TYPE OF ASSESSMENT ON WHAT SPACE NEEDS ARE -- NOW. SO THAT WE CAN START BUDGETING FOR IT I'M STEP -- FIVE YOU KNOW IT IT IT. IT WOULD BE NICE IF WE'RE ABLE TO HIRE ALL THE PEOPLE WE NEED TO DO THE TEACHING IN. AND AND HELP FACILITATE -- BUT CBT CLASSES AND OTHER THINGS AND LET'S JUST SAY WERE FULLY STAFFED. IF THE ONLY SPACE YOU HAVE OR IS IS PROBABLY TO IS IS THE IS THE SIZE. OF THE SMALLEST ASSEMBLY OFFICE YEAR YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO TEACH A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE. I SAY WHO'S OFFICER WAS BUT IT'S IT COULD BE REALLY DIFFICULT IF YOU GOT A HUNDRED PEOPLE OR MORE. THAT ONE IN. GET SOME THAT SO THAT'S THAT COULD BE CRUCIAL. IN MAKING SURE THIS HAPPENED SO I I I TO WILL URGE. CDC ARE TO GET THAT GET THOSE SPECS TO ASSIST SOON AS POSSIBLE. SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER JONES SAWYER I KNOW WE HAVE A QUESTION BY MISTER CALDERON BUT LET ME ASK REAL QUICK JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON HIS BECAUSE YOU -- MADAM WATER YOU HAD TALKED ABOUT THE C. B. D. PROGRAMS BUT WE'RE ONLY LOOKING AT UP 225% OF THOSE AND MISTER -- JONES SAWYER WAS TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF OTHER PROGRAMS AND SOME I'VE ACTUALLY SEEN AS WELL OVER A CAL CITY AND THE DOGS AND WHAT THAT ACTUALLY DOES FOR THE INMATES. WHO WERE YOU ABLE TO FIND ANALYTICS FROM? THE CDC ARE ON HOW THAT HAD AN AFFECT MEAN BECAUSE IT SOUNDED LIKE YOU WERE. HAVING ISSUES WITH THE NUMBERS IN THE ANALYTICS FOR THE C. B. T. PROGRAMS BUT THESE OTHER PROGRAMS I WOULD IMAGINE. WAS IT THE SAME. OUTCOME OR NOT BECAUSE AND THAT'S QUESTION WE CAN ASK THE NEXT BATTLE. RIGHT WHAT WHEN WE I TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS AND THEY WERE WERE OF HOW SUCCESSFUL THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY PROGRESS TO DATE WITH RESPECT TO THAT SO WE DIDN'T SEE ANY ANALYTICS. CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG WE DIDN'T SEE ANY ANALYTICS RELATED TO HOW SUCCESSFUL OR HOW COST EFFECTIVE THESE VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS ARMY WE TRY TO USE SOME OF THAT TERMINOLOGY IN THE REPORT COST EFFECTIVENESS. OF THESE PARTICULAR PROGRAMS AND THAT'S WHY WE DID THE ANALYSIS OF IF YOU. YOU KNOW PREVENT ONE ONE OUT OF NINE FROM RECENT EVADING IT THE PAPER THE THE FOR SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS PAY FOR THEMSELVES. SO THERE NEEDS TO BE THAT FISCAL ANALYSIS OF THE BENEFITS OF SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS AND WE DID NOT SEE THAT WE LOOKED AT C. B. T. BUT WE ALSO TALK TO THEM ABOUT THE VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS. AND DID NOT SEE ANY IN ANALYTICS OR ANY ANALYSIS OF THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF THOSE PARTICULAR PROGRAMS AND I WAS GONNA ASK THIS LATER A BABY ASSETS NOW. OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS YOU CAME OUT WITH BECAUSE NOW WE'RE AT THE SIXTY DAY MARK I COUNTED TWENTY FOUR RECOMMENDATIONS. THAT WERE LISTED THERE AND OF THOSE TWENTY FOUR RECOMMENDATIONS HOW MANY. THE MISTER PHONE OR YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW MANY WERE ACTUALLY BEING IMPLEMENTED OF THE TWENTY FOUR SO WE CAN AT THIRTEEN IS PENDING SO THEY'RE IN THE PLANNING STAGES TO BE PLANNING IMPLEMENTING OF THOUGHT FOR SO THEIR FOURTEEN FOR CDC ARE -- THIRTEEN OF THOSE WITH CANADA'S PENDING IS AND THERE WERE SOME ACTION BUT IT KIND OF WAS SO PRELIMINARY THAT WE COULD. MAKE A JUDGMENT CALL ON WHETHER WAS IMPLEMENTED OR NOT. AND THEY HAD PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED ONE RELATED -- TO STAFFING. AND FOR MONITORING THE STAFFING VACANCIES OUT SO WHAT'S THE NEXT PANEL ON AN UPDATE ON THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS RIGHT I LIST YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND JUST REAL QUICKLY I'M SORRY MISTER CALDERON SO. WE MADE A VARIETY OF RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE AND CERTAINLY MADE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS TO SEE ROB BUT THE OTHER THE OTHER POINT THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THE MEMBERS UNDERSTAND IS. WHEN THAT WHEN THE REPORT IS ISSUED IN JANUARY LATE JANUARY THROUGH THE LAST DAY GENERATE THIRTY FIRST OF OF THIS YEAR? THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT'S THE FIRST TIME OR WITHIN A FEW WEEKS CDC ARE WAS AWARE OF THESE ISSUES WHENEVER MY OFFICE IS CONDUCTING AN AUDIT WORK CONSTANTLY IN CONTACT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION -- AND THE PROGRAM OFFICIAL SO. WHEN WE'RE PRETTY CLOSE TO DRAFTING REPORT SO A LOT OF THESE ISSUES AND MANY OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS THE THE DEPARTMENT WAS AWARE OF MONTHS AGO? LONG BEFORE WE ISSUED A REPORT IN JANUARY SO THEY HAVE HAD A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME TO REALLY THINK ABOUT SOME OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AND GET SOME PROGRESS MADE. NOW OFTENTIMES I SAY WE DON'T LOOK FOR A LOT OF PROGRESS IN SIXTY DAYS. BUT WE WOULD EXPECT OUR SIX MONTH RESPONSE TYPICALLY IS WHERE WE REALLY EXPECT PROGRESS TO BE MADE AND WE DO HAVE CONCERNS BASED ON HISTORICAL. OUR WORK IN AUDITING THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS IN AND SOME OF THE DISCUSSION I HAD. A WITH YOU REGARDING YOU KNOW THEY'VE THOUGHT ABOUT USING AN EXTERNAL RESEARCHER BUT THEY HAVEN'T DEVELOPED A SCOPE YET THEY'RE SUGGESTING THEY'RE GONNA HAVE A SCOPE. AND A CONTRACT BY APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY THEY SHOULD BE WORKING ON THAT NOW THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO SHOW THE LEGISLATURE AND PERHAPS US AT LEAST. THE BEGINNINGS OF A SCOPE BY THE SIX MONTH REACHED A RESPONSE IN JULY. US BECAUSE WE'RE WE'RE GIVING THEM A THREE YEAR PLAN BUT WE NEED TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO THAT PLAN. AND AS AS MR FELDER SAID A LOT OF MORE PENDING AND THAT'S A REALLY THAT'S A CONCERN TO US TO ME IN PARTICULAR AS THE STATE AUDITOR. I WANT TO SEE MORE PROGRESS FROM THE DEPARTMENT -- AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL SEE THAT AT THE SIX MONTH OR PERHAPS WILL BE OVER HERE FROM THE DEPARTMENT TODAY WHERE THEY'VE MADE A BIT MORE PROGRESS IN SOME OF THESE AREAS BECAUSE THAT EXTERNAL RESEARCHER GETTING THE DATA. THEY WILL HAVE THE INFORMATION TO BE ABLE TO DO AN ANALYSIS OF THE RECIDIVISM RATE. YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE SCOPE IS IS COPING TO BE LIMITED TO CBT PROGRAMS IS GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THE ACADEMIC IS A GOING TO BE LOOKING AT FOLK AT IS GOING TO BE LOOKING AT VOLUNTEER. ARE YOU GONNA LOOK AT HOW ARE THEY PRIORITIZING WHEN ARE THEY GOING TO RE ASSESS THESE TOOLS THERE'S A VARIETY OF FACTORS THAT IN IMPACT. THE STATE'S ABILITY TO REALLY PROVIDE SERVICES AND MY WORDS TO INMATES TO TO INCREASE THEIR THEIR POSSIBILITY BEING SUCCESSFUL MAKE WHEN THEY ARE RELEASED FROM PRISON IN CALIFORNIA. SO THAT THEY ARE NOW AND I WOULD IMAGINE IT WOULD BEHOOVE THE DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY HAVE SOME OF THOSE ANALYTICS ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT EDUCATION PROGRAMS OF YOU COULD SAY 80% OF THE FOLKS. THAT RUN IT IS PROGRAM GRADUATE WITH A DEGREE ECCENTRIC -- SO DEFINITELY AGREE WITH YOU LET'S GO TO MOVED -- MISTER CALDERON THANK YOU MISTER SAUCE AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE POINT THAT -- MISS JONES SAWYER WAS TRYING TO MAKE BECAUSE YOU KNOW. OUR INTENT IS IN -- TO BE MYOPIC WHEN IT COMES TO THE APPROACH THAT WE EXPECT THE DEPARTMENT TO TAKE WHEN IT WHEN IT COMES TO THESE PROGRAMS WE WE WANT ALLOW FOR CREATIVITY WE WANT ALLOW FOR INNOVATION -- BUT ONE THING THAT HAS BEEN SO -- PREVALENT IN MY IN MY EXPERIENCE IN THE SEVEN YEARS THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE OUR STATE AGENCIES IN THE COMPLACENCY WITHIN THE STATE AGENCIES TO JUST GO ALONG AND GO WITH WITH THIS IS THE WAY THINGS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN DONE. THAT'S THAT'S WHY WE GET INTO A LOT OF TROUBLE AND THAT'S WHY -- OVERSIGHT OVER THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY HAS BECOME SO IMPORTANT IN SUCH A IT ISSUE SUCH THAT WE ARE FOCUSING A LOT MORE ATTENTION ON I'M A LOT MORE ATTENTION ON OUR OVERSIGHT -- CAPACITY BECAUSE YOU KNOW. WE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY AND WE DO KNOW THAT THAT MONEY IS BEING SPENT IN THE RIGHT PLACES -- YOU KNOW THERE COULD BE A PROGRAM YOU KNOW IT FROM FOLKS THAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO TALK TO THAT'S IN OUR PROGRAM. THAT DOES WONDERS FOR CERTAIN GROUP CERTAIN GROUP OF PEOPLE AND WE WERE DEALING WITH SO MANY DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES SO MANY DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS. YOU KNOW VARIETY AND PROGRAMS ARE IMPORTANT -- AND YOU KNOW IT IT WAS IT IS INTERESTING HERE ABOUT THE EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS THAT THE THE LIMITED PULL I IN TERMS OF THE SCOPE OF THOSE PROGRAMS THAT THAT IT DOESN'T REALLY GO BEYOND LIKE SAY JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS -- I THINK JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT -- WHEN IT COMES TO REHABILITATION YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO SPENT TEN YEARS IN PRISON? YOU KNOW THEY MAY MAY HAVE GONE IN FOR A DRUG CHARGE -- BUT TEN YEARS IN PRISON IF THEY DIDN'T GET THE THE THE SERVICE AT THAT THEY THAT THEY NEEDED TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR JOB DRUG PROBLEM WHICH OFTEN HAPPENS -- AND SOMETIMES THEY HAVE A DRUG PROBLEM THIS DEVELOP BECAUSE OF OF A MISDIAGNOSIS UNDIAGNOSED MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE -- BUT THEY SPEND TEN YEARS PLUS IN PRISON BECAUSE OF THAT. AND THEY COME OUT THEY'RE DIFFERENT PERSON -- AND IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO EXPECT THEM TO BECOME AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN SOCIETY WHEN YOU KNOW WE ARE NOT OFFERING. PROGRAMS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO WHAT THEIR LIFE IS GOING TO BE LIKE WHEN THEY GET OUT OF PRISON BECAUSE ALSO WHEN THEY WENT INTO PRISON THE WORLD WAS A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE THAN WHEN THEY'RE COMING OUT. OF PRISON -- AND SO YOU KNOW OUR INTENT OUR INTENT IS IN TO TO LIMIT THE ABILITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO BE CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE IN THE PROGRAMS AREN'T OUR INTENT IS TO HOPEFULLY INSPIRE THEM -- BUT ALSO WE NEED METRICS TO PERFORMANCE METRICS IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THAT -- WE ARE GETTING THAT RETURN ON INVESTMENT IS JONES JONES SAWYER DOES. ALLUDE TO AND WE HAVE TO HAVE A HIGH STANDARD WHEN IT COMES TO THE PEOPLE THAT WE ALLOWED TO COME AND RUN A REHABILITATION PROGRAM BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THERE ARE PROGRAMS THAT ARE RUN WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT -- THAT SOMETIMESME THEY GET PAID BASED OFF OF THE INDIVIDUAL SOME INDIVIDUALS THEY GET TO SIGN UP AND MAYBE -- IT ISN'T SO MUCH ABOUT ACTUALLY HAVING THEM DO WHATEVER THE PROGRAM IS SAYING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO OFFER WHATEVER. WHATEVER THEY'RE OFFERING IT'S IT'S ABOUT GETTING THE SIGNATURES AND GETTING THE NAMES AND NOW TAKEN OFF AND MAYBE GO FOR A WALK OR DOING SOMETHING ELSE NOT NECESSARILY ACTUALLY PARTICIPATING. IN THE PROGRAM THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE REHABILITATED FOR THEM YOU KNOW AND AND THEIR DIFFERENT INCENTIVES THAT ARE THAT MY AND FROM MY UNDERSTANDING ARE OFFERED TO THE INMATES FOR BEING ABLE TO SIGN UP. OFFER A PROGRAM. WITHOUT NECESSARILY HAVING TO PARTICIPATE. IN THAT PROGRAM THE WIDGET WE WE SPEND SO MUCH MONEY WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO KNOW WHERE THAT MONEY'S GOING AND HAS TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY AND HOW THESE PROGRAMS ARE. ADMINISTERED WELL. I I'M GONNA HAVE TO LEAVE BECAUSE I HAVE -- MEETING THEM HAVE TO GO ATTEND BUT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING THE TESTIMONY AND THE MEN THE SUMMARY FROM MY STAFF WHEN IT COMES TO THE TESTIMONY OF THAT -- THE THE THE DEPARTMENT BOB. BUT THIS MATTERS AND WE SPEND A LOT OF MONEY NOT JUST IN A REHABILITATION PROGRAM BUT ON CORRECTIONS. AND SO THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS AUDIT WAS TO GET. WAS TO GET THE INFORMATION THAT WE GOT IT ISN'T SURPRISING TO ME THAT THE MAN FROM NATION. THE INFORMATION THAT WE DID RECEIVE BECAUSE THAT WAS THIS THAT'S DOUBTS WHAT WE SUSPECTED BUT IT'S ALSO PARTLY OUR FAULT BECAUSE WE NEVER. LOOKED AT IT BECAUSE WE WERE NEVER FOR SMALL IN AND IN OUR IN OUR ABILITY TO ASK FOR THAT INFORMATION IN TO GET THAT A TYPE OF INFORMATION SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE I REALLY APPRECIATE. THE WORK THAT YOU GUYS HAVE DONE -- BUT I REALLY WANT THIS TO BE MOTIVATING. FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED ESPECIALLY THE DEPARTMENT TO HAVE A HIGHER STANDARD HOLD THEMSELVES TO A HIGHER STANDARD AND UNDERSTAND. THE IMPORTANCE OF RUNNING THESE PROGRAMS AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE BEST POSSIBLEPROGRAMS THAT ARE PROVIDING THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE GONNA GET OUT EVENTUALLY THE THE BEST OPPORTUNITIES TO BE SUCCESSFUL SO THAT THEY DO NOT RECEIVE A BECAUSE IT COSTS TOO MUCH MONEY. AND WE ARE MOVING AWAY FROM THIS IDEA OF LOCK HIM UP AND THROW AWAY THE KEY. AND TOWARDS THE IDEA AND TOWARDS A PRACTICE OF REHABILITATE AND THEN ALSO INJECT MORE MONEY INTO LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES WHICH WE STILL NEED TO DO THIS AND TO LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES TO PREVENT. THOSE KIDS ARE GROWING UP IN THIS LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES TO FROM EVER BELIEVING THAT THE ONLY WAY THAT THEY CAN BE SUCCESSFUL AND HAVE A GOOD LIFE IS TO SELL DRUGS TO JOIN A GANG. BECAUSE THAT'S ALL THEY KNOW AND THAT'S WHAT THEY GREW UP WITH AND THAT'S WHAT THE ROLE MODELS DID. IN ORDER STE IN ORDER TO SURVIVE AND SO THAT'S WHERE THE FOCUS NEEDS TO BE NOT NECESSARILY ON YOU KNOW. THIS LOCK THEM UP AND THROW AWAY THE KEY ENTRY EVERYBODY THE SAME AS IF EVERYBODY'S LIFE TO BE EXPERIENCES ARE THE SAME EVERYBODY GREW UP THE SAME SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES BECAUSE IT MATTERS AND THAT EVERYBODY DID. BUT I REALLY THINK YOU -- AND CALIFORNIA HEARING ABOUT THE REST OF THE THE PANEL. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS I KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN ALLUDING TO IS. AND MY OPENING COMMENTS I TALKED ABOUT THE SIXTY FOUR MILLION WE GAVE THREE YEARS AGO AND WHAT ARE WE GETTING OUT OF THAT ARE MORE THE ANALYTICS FOR IT -- THE SIXTY DAY CHECK IN BUT WE ALSO HAVE THE SIX MONTH AND ESPECIALLY AS WE MOVE INTO THE MAY REVISE. AND THE ULTIMATE -- BUDGET IN JUNE THESE ARE THESE ARE ANSWERS THAT WE ALL UP HERE WANT. TO HAVE SO THAT WERE INFORMED ABOUT HOW WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT I KNOW MISS COM LONGER DOVE HAS A QUESTION. WE'LL GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO MESS BAUER-KAHAN. FIRST PLACE RIBBON. COMMENTED AFTER. YES -- THANK YOU FOR THIS REPORT AND FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS I WANT TO ECHO THE OPINIONS OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT YOU KNOW WE WANT TO RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT WHEN IT COMES OR SPENDING. IN OUR PRISON SYSTEM BUT I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT. RECIDIVISM ALSO MEANS CRIMES ARE BEING COMMITTED OUR COMMUNITIES WHICH MEANS WHEN WE REDUCE RECIDIVISM WE MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER WE ALSO INCREASE WE ARE OUTCOMES ARE BETTER FOR THOSE WHEN THEY CAN REENTER SOCIETY AND DO SO SUCCESSFULLY SO THERE'S A WHOLE HOST OF REASONS. WHY WE SHOULD BE DRIVING FOR SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMMING OUR PRISONS AND SO I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON THAT -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT IS EVIDENCE BASED IN METRICS IN THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT. I AM NEW TO POLITICS INTO GOVERNMENT I COME OUT OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND TO ME IT IS FASCINATING THAT WE CAN'T MAKE MORE DATA DRIVEN DECISIONS. WHICH IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS HOW WE MAKE DECISIONS IF YOU KNOW SO ONE OF THE THINGS I'M LEARNING IS THAT OUR DATA IS SO SEGREGATED THAT IT IS HARD TO KNOW OBVIOUSLY THE QUESTION THE ONE NEEDS TO ASK TO SEE IF THESE PROGRAMS. ARE WORKING -- VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD WEEK PEOPLE SIGN UP WE KNOW WHICH PROGRAMS EACH INMATE TAKES IF THEY COMMIT A CRIME THERE'S A SEPARATE SYSTEM THAT TELLS US THAT THEY'VE BEEN CHARGED WITH A CRIME. SO THE QUESTION OF RESIDENT RECIDIVISM AND THE PROGRAMMING THAT WORK SHOULD BE VERY STRAIGHT FORWARD BUT WHAT I'M HEARING TODAY IS THAT WE'RE NOT ABLE TO PUT THAT DATA TOGETHER TO MAKE DATA DRIVEN DECISIONS ABOUT WHICH OF THESE PROGRAMS. ARE SUCCESSFUL REPLICATE THOSE INSURE THOSE ARE BEING PUT INTO ALL OF OUR PRISONS AND ENSURE THE PEOPLE OF ACCESS TO THOSE DO YOU HAVE A SENSE AND WE CAN ASK THE DEPARTMENT THIS IS WELL. YOU KNOW WE'RE IS THE FAILURE IN OUR DATA SYSTEM TO BE ABLE TO PUT THESE ANSWERS TOGETHER. I THINK A GOOD EXAMPLE THAT FROM OUR REPORT IS -- THE LACK OF COORDINATION BETWEEN EDT AND CDC ARE REGARDING VOCATIONAL PROGRAMMING SO WE THOUGHT THAT IT BE PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD TO HEAD INMATE. ALL RIGHT THEY'VE GOT YOU KNOW THEY GET THE X. RECEIVES A VOCATIONAL TRAINING AND THEN THEY'RE GOING TO GO OUT WELL DID THEY GET A JOB. IS AND THE THING THEY WERE TRAINED IT RIGHT IN THERE IN THAT FIELD. AND THAT CDC ARE IN ET DE HAD BEEN TRYING TO WORK TOGETHER FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME BUT THERE HAD BEEN SEVERAL ISSUES RELATED% TO SHARING AND SOCIAL SECURITY pRELATED CONCERNS. AND IT'S A WE HAVE A RECOMMENDATION ALL REPORT -- ONE LEGISLATIVE TO AMEND THE LAW TO MAKE IT EASIER TO COORDINATE. AND SECONDLY JUST TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO SEE OUR I NEEDED TO WORK TO WORK OUT THEIR DIFFERENCES NOW THERE ARE THERE ARE. DIFFICULTIES BECAUSE OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS -- YOU NOTED THAT -- A FORMER APART MAYBE BY USING MULTIPLE SO SECURITY NUMBERS ARE DIFFERENT NAMES. BUT THE THERE ARE CERTAINLY WAYS YOU CAN DO THIS AND THAT YOU KNOW. THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE FOUND IT OKAY IF WE CAN IF WE CAN BRING THESE TWO ENTITIES TOGETHER AND GET A WORKING TOGETHER. THEN WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE WHICH VOCATIONAL PROGRAMS WORK BEST AND THEN FINAL IT'LL BE FUN TO MORE MONEY TOWARD THOSE GUYS WERE SAYING -- THESE ARE THE ONES THAT WORKING THERE COULD NOT ONLY KEEP PEOPLE PLOY THAT THAT MEANS ARE NOT POSITIVE AIDING. SO -- THAT. THAT KIND OF GIVES YOU SOME IDEA OF WHAT WE'RE TO WHAT WE FOUND. YEAH I MEAN AS I'VE COME HERE AND YOU KNOW ASK THESE QUESTIONS YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT ALSO THE COUNTY LEVEL RIGHT WHICH WERE IMPRISONED MORE PEOPLE IN THE COUNTY PRESENCE AS WELL THESE DAYS. ONE OF THE ANSWERS I GOT WAS WELL WE DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU THAT BECAUSE YOU MIGHT TAKE THE MONEY AWAY CLICK WELL. YES OF ITS NOT WORKING WE ARE GOING TO STOP WE SHOULD NOT BE SPENDING ON THAT PROGRAM THAT ISN'T TO SAY WILL TAKE MONEY AWAY FOR PROGRAMMING BUT LET'S SPEND IT ON THE ONES THAT WORK AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A MORE. OPEN DIALOGUE ABOUT WHAT IS SUCCESSFUL WHAT IS WORKING AND SPEND APPROPRIATELY AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THEIR FIXES THAT WE CAN PUT IN TO MAKE THAT EASIER I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK LONG AND HARD AT THAT THANK YOU. AND I THINK THAT'S CORRECT WAIT ACTUALLY ASSASSIN LOOK AT IT BECAUSE YOU DON'T SHOW IF IT'S ACTUALLY WORKING. YOU KNOW I KNOW THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES WILL PROBABLY BE LIKE WELL IF YOU CAN'T PROVE THAT IT'S WORKING WILL PUT IT TO ANOTHER PROGRAM THAT DOES SHOW. THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY REDUCING RECIDIVISM AND I KNOW THAT'S A DISCUSSION I HAD WITH MY COLLEAGUES UP HERE WITH THAT WILL MOVE TO MISS COME LONGER TOUGH. THANK YOU SO -- YOU KNOW THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LONG DAY FOR ME BUT HE DID THIS IS VERY DISCOURAGING THERE'S SOME HOPE BUT IT'S DISCOURAGING. I ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW -- YOU DON'T EVALUATE WHAT YOU DON'T VALUE. YOU KNOW AND IF WE AREN'T VALUING. CORRECTIONS AND THE PEOPLE THAT ARE INCARCERATED. THEN WE'RE ACTUALLY NOT GOING TO TAKE THE DEEP DIVES THAT WE NEED TO TO FIGURE OUT WHAT PROGRAMS ARE WORKING. I WOULD ALSO ARGUE THAT SOME PEOPLE MAY BE VERY EXCITED ABOUT RECIDIVISM RATES EITHER GOING UP OR STAYING AT HIGH RATES. BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THAT MEANS THAT THOSE SYSTEMS ARE STILL RUNNING AND PEOPLE ARE STILL BEING EMPLOYED OPERATING THEM. AND SO HOW DO WE GET TO A CONVERSATION OR A PLACE WHERE WE CAN REDUCE RECIDIVISM BUT STILL HAVE. YOU KNOW ROBUST EMPLOYMENT. MAYBE JUST HAVING FOLKS DOING DIFFERENT THINGS RIGHT IN I'M INTERESTED IN HOW WE GET TO A PLACE WE CAN BOTH PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF THE INNOCENT. WHILE RESPECTING THE HUMANITY OF THE GUILTY. AND YOU RESPECT THE HUMANITY OF THE GUILTY WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY PUTTING PROGRAMS WITHIN CORRECTIONS. AND EVALUATING THEM AND FIGURING OUT WHAT WORKS BECAUSE PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW THEIR RIGHTS THEY SHOULD BE GAINING FINANCIAL LITERACY THEY SHOULD BE WORKING ON COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT. THEY SHOULD BE WORKING ON THERAPY THEY SHOULD BE WORKING ON EDUCATION AND WE SHOULD BE WORKING WITH THEM TO HELP THEM HAVE THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEED. TO INTEGRATE BACK INTO SOCIETY. THE CHALLENGE MAY BE. THAT NO [inaudible] ONE APPRECIATE FAILURE. IT'S OKAY TO ACTUALLY HAVE A PROGRAM. YOU EVALUATE IT YOU LOOK AT THE DATA THE DATA IS AS IS NOT WORKING. YOU TRY SOMETHING NEW. YOU KNOW NOT EVERY IDEA IS A GREAT IDEA BUT IF PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO EVALUATE IT BECAUSE TO MS BAUER CANS POINT IF IT FAILS THEN YOU JUST TAKE AWAY THE MONEY. THEN OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THESE HALF BAKED. BIG DOESN'T THE WORD I WANT TO USE HALF BAKED PROGRAMS. WHICH GOES BACK TO OT VALUING. THE CORRECTIONAL AND THE REHABILITATION. COMPONENTS OF CDC ARE. SO. IS THAT IT'S A CULTURE SHIFT IN MY MIND IN TERMS OF HELPING FOLKS UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS A CONTINUUM RIGHT IN TERMS OF THESE CHECK INS THAT WE SHOULD ALL BE DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ON THE RIGHT PATH. BECAUSE YOU ACTUALLY CAN GET RETURN ON INVESTMENT. RIGHT I THINK THE ECONOMICS WORK IN THE OTHER WAY IF YOU GET FOLKS OUT. IN THEIR IN COMMUNITIES OR IF YOU'RE FIGURING OUT WHO THE RIGHT PEOPLE ARE THAT YOU SHOULD BE CONTRACTING WITH TO BRING THEM INTO CORRECTIONS AND INTO THE PRISONS. YOU CAN PROBABLY CUT COSTS BECAUSE YOUR OPERATING PROGRAMS THAT ACTUALLY INMATES MEET THANK YOU. THANK YOU WAS COMMANDEERED OF I BELIEVE MISTER JONES SAWYER HAS A QUICK COMMENT REALLY WILL MOVE WITH THE NATIONAL. IN YOUR REPORT -- YOU SAID THAT -- BASICALLY -- AS FAR AS THE BUDGET IS CONCERNED FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE EMPLOYED IN REHABILITATION MONIES YOU NEED TO CONTINUE REHABILITATION PROGRAMS. THAT YOU DIDN'T SEE US GIVEN AN ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION THAT THE DEPARTMENT. HAS THE RESOURCES FINANCIALLY. I'LL TAKE AWAY THE SPACE REQUIREMENT TO THAT'S A DIFFERENT DISCUSSION. FOR RIGHT NOW -- PRETTY ON THE SPOT KIND OF PUTTING THEM ON THE SPOT THAT THEY CAN. THEY CAN MAKE THE CHANGES WITH EXISTING FUNDING. THAT'S CORRECT AS FAR AS THE THE BUDGETED AMOUNT THEY HAVE TO STAFF THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS WE FELT THAT THEY HAD SUFFICIENT BUDGET -- TO BE ABLE TO TO HIRE PEOPLE AND PROVIDE -- INSTRUCTORS FOR THOSE VARIOUS PROGRAMS SO WE DIDN'T SEE A NEED FOR INCREASED RESOURCES FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE BUT FACILITIES. AS AS MUCH OF MISTER FILNER SAID THEY'VE GOT TO DO -- AND IT'S AN ANALYSIS OF ALL THEIR DIFFERENT FACILITIES AND WHAT SPACE DO THEY HAVE ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS AND WHAT ARE SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS -- THAT THEY COULD BRING FORWARD TO EXPAND -- THOSE COURSES. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU WITH THAT NUMBER QUESTIONS THANK YOU. FRENCH RESTAURANT HERE MEMBERS YES SIR SHARE IT. THANK YOU AND MORE THAN WELCOME TO SET THE TABLE IF NOT WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE SECOND PANEL OF ITEM NUMBER THREE COMMENTS AND RESPONSES ON AUDIT FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION WE HAVE MISTER DE AS A SECRETARY AND WE HAVE MISTER -- SO THOSE ARE THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR DIVISION OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS AND I'D LIKE TO THANK MISTER VOEPEL FOR JOINING US. WE ARE READY TO BEGIN. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON -- YOU THEIR SEXUAL YOU DON'T GET IT ANY TROUBLE WHAT IS YOUR FISHER TODD YOU'RE NOT IN A ROOM YOU'RE I AM THE SECRETARY OF CORRECTIONS I'VE BEEN APPOINTED BY GOVERNOR TO SOME AS OF OR YOU ARE YOU OFFICIALLY CONFIRMED BY THE SENATE. I AM NOT OFFICIALLY CONFIRMED BY THIS AND YET JUST APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR REMINDING ME OF THAT HOW MUCH DID YOU TROUBLED THANK YOU SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON SURE HAD MEMBERS I DO APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION OF THE PRESENTATION BY THE AUDITOR I I REALLY TAKEN MANY NOTES AND TAKEN SOME OF POINT TWO AND I KNOW. THAT THE DIRECTORS WHOSE -- WILL BE MAKING SOME COMMENTS ON THE AUDIT ITSELF AND EVEN SOME OF THE POINTS THAT WERE DISCUSSED -- IN THE FIRST PANEL -- THAT'S ALREADY BEEN SAID THAT I AM THE NEWLY APPOINTED SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION APPOINTED BY GOVERNOR NEW SOME. AND I COME TO YOU WITH NEARLY TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OF CORRECTIONAL EXPERIENCE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND I BELIEVE I CAN WITH THE UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE. OF WHAT THAT IS -- I BEGAN THE DEPARTMENT WHEN IT WAS JUST -- CDC IT WAS OVERCROWDED THERE WAS NO ARE THE PROGRAMS WEREN'T AS ROBUST AND THEY WEREN'T FUNDED AS THEY ARE TODAY. I SARS A CORRECTIONAL OFFICER IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES -- AND MADE MY WAY UP AND DURING THE HEIGHT OF OVERCROWDING I WAS THE CAPTAIN ON A FACILITY RIGHT ABOUT THE TIME THAT THE RECESSION HIT THE PROGRAMS WERE CUT. AND THAT WAS A PRETTY HIGH INTENSE FACILITY WITH A LOT OF NEEDS BUT THAT WHEN THE FUNDING GOT CUT FOR THESE PROGRAMS. BECAME VERY INTENSE AND IT WAS A HARD PLACE TO MANAGE FOR THE INMATES AND THE EMPLOYEES. I BEGAN WITH THE IDEA YOU KNOW AT THAT TIME. THAT -- WHEN I BEGAN MY CAREER IT WAS ALL ABOUT JUST LOCKING THE DOORS AND COUNTING -- AND HOPEFULLY WE ALL GO HOME SAFELY. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THE TRAJECTORY THAT I'VE MADE FROM A CORRECTIONAL OFFICER DURING THOSE REALLY DARK TIMES AND CORRECTIONS TO WHERE I AM NOW. AS AGENCY HEAD INTO WHERE WE HAVE DEVELOPED AND WHERE THE ARE WAS PLACED ON IN CORRECTIONS. I BELIEVE WE ARE WHAT WE NEED TO BE IN CORRECTIONS HOWEVER. I DO NEED TO SAY THE TWO YEARS AGO SOMETHING HAPPENED CALIFORNIA THAT I BELIEVE WAS SIGNIFICANT. THE RAMIFICATIONS OF OUR UNDERSTANDING OF REHABILITATION IS -- HASN'T FULLY BEEN UNDERSTOOD JET AND WE ARE STILL WORKING THROUGH. IN OURPRISONS EMPIRE AND BY OUR POPULATION AND OUR STAFF AND THAT IS PROPOSITION. FIFTY SEVEN PROPOSITION. FIFTY SEVEN WAS VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY BY THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA IT GAVE AUTHORITY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND IN PARTICULAR TO THE SECRETARY. TO AWARD CREDITS IN INMATES FOR PARTICIPATION MEANINGFUL REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS. IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE PROGRAMS BY THE PRIOR SECRETARY AND MYSELF -- WE STRUGGLED WITH IT TO DETERMINE WHAT THAT MEANT. TO HAVE MEANINGFUL PROGRAMS BECAUSE WE BOTH WORK IN A DAY WHEN THIS DIDN'T MEAN A WHOLE LOT. AND WE KNEW THAT THERE WAS A DAY THAT WE COULD BE BETTER AND WE KNEW THAT THERE WAS A DAY THAT WERE AT THE TIME. WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATURE THIS PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION WE CAN DO BETTER BY CORRECTIONS. THE MORE TRADITIONAL CORRECTIONAL STAFF ARGUED THAT THE THAT ONLY COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR PROGRAMS AND ONLY GETTING MANAGEMENT ANGER MANAGEMENT IN A IN A IN WERE THE ONLY WAY TO GO THAT WOULD BE YOUR TRADITIONAL EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAM THAT'S THE ONLY WAY TO GO. NOW OTHERS IN THE DEPARTMENT THEY ADVOCATED THAT WE NEED TO GO A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. AND THAT OTHERS PERSONALLY WITNESSED SOME OF THE OTHER TYPES OF PROGRAMS OF INSIDE THE WALLS OR MAKING POSITIVE IMPACTS ON THE POPULATION NOT ONLY UPON RELEASE. BUT WHILE THEY WERE IN PRISON AND THAT'S WERE. RECIDIVISM IMPACTS BEGIN WHILE THEY ARE IN PRISON NOT SO MUCH FROM THE RELEASE BECAUSE YOU BEGIN THAT PROCESS WHILE THEY'RE IN PRISON. IN MAY TWO LIVES ARE CHANGED BY PERFORMING. THINGS LIKE SHAKESPEARE. LEARNING HOW TO CODE. LEARNING HOW TO CARE FOR ANIMALS SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS ARE BARBARA TALKED ON THE FIRST PANEL BUT I CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH. HOW IMPORTANT A SHIP THAT HAS BEEN IN CORRECTIONS JUST BY SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS AND WE HAVE A MYRIAD OF OTHERS? ONE MAN'S REHABILITATION WAS SPARKED AT ST QUIT AND WHEN HE JOINED A RUNNING GROUP AND SANG QUITTING. THAT INDIVIDUAL NOW IS GONNA BE RUNNING IN THE BOSTON MARATHON THIS WEEK WE'RE JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO HE WAS A LIFE FROM ONE OF OUR INSTITUTIONS. HIS LIFE SHIFTED BECAUSE OF THE PROGRAM'S HE PARTICIPATED IN. OUR STAFF WHAT SHOULD REMIND YOU ALSO STRUGGLE SUBSTANCE ABUSE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SUICIDALITY POOR HEALTH. AND THEY HAVE THEIR OWN ISSUES ALSO HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING THAT REHABILITATION INCLUDED THESE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE POPULATION BECAUSE THIS THIS POPULATION BUT THEY TAKE CARE OF ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS. THESE ARE RANK AND FILE CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS ARE CORRECTIONAL STAFF WHO ARE ALSO ADVOCATING FOR THE SET TO PROGRAM. AND YES THEY ARE PROGRAMS LIKE GARDENING THEY'RE LIKE FAITH BASED PROGRAMS AND EVEN YOGA. OUR UNDERSTANDING OF REAL ABATE REHABILITATION THIS TRANSFORM BE OUR TRADITIONAL DISCUSSIONS OF EVIDENCE BASED. COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR DIALECTICAL BEHAVIOR RISKING NEEDS ASSESSMENTS AND UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE TRYING TO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. IN THE DEPARTMENT IS TRYING TO BUILD. WHOLE HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS WHO WIN ONE PILLAR OF THE REHABILITATION FALLS DOWN ANOTHER IS ARE SUPPORTED TO HOLD THEM UP. AND THAT'S WHERE THIS THIS VAST REHABILITATION CATALOGUE THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. THAT THAT IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO THE ONGOING WORK OF REHABILITATION. WE RESEARCH NATIONALLY HOW TO EVALUATE THE REHABILITATIVE IMPACTS AND SELF HELP PROGRAMS FAITH BASED PROGRAMS RECREATIONAL PROGRAMS CULTURAL PROGRAMS AMONG OTHERS. AND FOUND THAT THERE WAS LITTLE TO NO RESEARCH STUDIES THAT SHOWED FOR INSTANCE THAT A DOG PROGRAM. COULD BE DIRECTLY CORRELATED TO RECIDIVISM AND WE TALKED ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT ALREADY BUT YET WE KNOW THAT THE BONDING THE AFFECTION. AND THE CARE OF LIVING CREATURES CAN HELP CULTIVATED CHANGED IN AN INDIVIDUAL BUT ALSO ON A PRISON YARD. I HAVE WITNESSED THAT PERSONALLY. PROGRAMS LIKE THAT A VERY INNOVATIVE TO ATTACH AN ANALYTIC TO SAY THAT IT IS -- EVIDENCE BASE AND IT DOES AFFECT RECIDIVISM BUT WHAT IT DOES DO. IT AFFECTS THE CULTURE OF THE YARD. AND I HAVE WITNESSED I PERSONALLY WE HAVE FOUND NO EVIDENCE. THE MEXICAN AMERICAN OR AFRICAN AMERICAN AND NATIVE AMERICAN ASSOCIATIONS IN THESE GROUPS CULTURAL GROUPS. HAVE ANY IMPACTS ON RECIDIVISM BUT YET WE KNOW HONORING THAT SHARED HISTORY AND TRADITION GIVES PEOPLE A SENSE OF BELONGING THAT GOES DEEPER THAN ANY GANG AFFILIATION. WE FIND NO RESEARCH THAT GOING TO CHURCH REDUCES RECIDIVISM. AND YET WE KNOW THAT FAITH CREATES A STRONGER MORAL CODE THAT ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY COULD ENFORCE. I DO WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SOARING CALDERON. AND THIS COMMITTEE. FOR REQUEST IN THIS AUDIT BECAUSE IT IS GIVING ME A FORM TO DISCUSS A MORE PROFOUND. PHILOSOPHICAL SHIP IN REHABILITATION BUT IT ALSO HAS MADE IMPORTANT TO TO EXPLAIN HOW WE HOW WE ANALYZED FOR THE METRICS HOW WE IMPROVE HOW WE AUDIT HOW WE HOLD EACH OTHER ACCOUNTABLE HOW WE HOLD OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE. TO THE FUNDS THAT ARE GIVEN TO US BY THE LEGISLATURE AND THAT'S WERE DEPUTY DIRECTOR RANTS WHOSE IS GONNA TAKE YOU LET A LITTLE BIT MORE. ON THE FINDINGS OF THE AUDIT BUT ALSO SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE'VE ALREADY PUT IN PLACE SINCE UP ON IT. WAS -- CONDUCTED. I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT THE OUT OF FOCUS MAINLY ON DATA GATHERED FROM TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY FIFTEEN AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH EFFORTS ALREADY UNDERWAY WITHIN DIVISION REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS. AND MY REMAINING TIME I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS CHANGED SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WITH THAT DATA. PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN WHICH I SPOKE OF BRIEFLY. DEPART WITHIN PROPOSITION. FIFTY SEVEN THE DEPARTMENT HAS AWARDED FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION CREDITS TO THE INMATES AT A PARTICIPATED IN THESE PROGRAMS I'M GONNA BREAK DOWN WHAT THAT MEANS IN PRISON YEARS EARNED SO IN MISSING GET OUT SOONER. AND I AGREE THAT WE KNEW WE DO NEED TO ATTACH AN ANALYTIC ON TO THOSE NUMBERS ON HOW MUCH YOU'VE SAVED JUST BASED. ON THAT. ON THE EDUCATION MERIT CREDITS IN MISS PARTICIPATED AND AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR THE ACHIEVE CERTIFICATES DIPLOMAS. THEY HAVE EARNED NINE THOUSAND FORTY ONE AWARD AND THAT EQUATES TO TWO THOUSAND FORTY ONE YEARS OFFER PRISON SENTENCES. MILESTONE CREDITS WHICH ARE ALSO EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS THEY'VE BEEN AWARDED 200-190-00100 AND FIFTY AWARDS AND THAT EQUATES PRISON SENTENCES. AND THE REAR BILL HEAD OF ACHIEVEMENT CREDITS IN THOSE ARE IN ESSENCE OUR TRADITIONAL SELF HELP SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE THAT WE TEND TO LABEL MAYBE NON EVIDENCE BASE BUT WE KNOW THEY'RE GOOD FOR THE POPULATION -- THEY HAVE BEEN AWARDED FIFTY ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED NINE AWARDS AND THAT EQUATES TO NINE HUNDRED NINETY YEARS OFF A PRISON SENTENCES. OFFENDERS RELEASED FROM THE DATA PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN WAS ENACTED. ON AN AVERAGE OF HAD THEIR SENTENCES SHORTENED BY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS AND THAT THEY'RE NOT GIVEN ANYTHING. WE DON'T GIVE THESE INMATES ANYTHING JUST BECAUSE THEY SHOW UP. THEY HAVE TO EARN THEM. WE OVERSEE THEM WE MAKE SURE THEIR PRESENT. AND BUT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT NOT EVERYONE YOU CAN'T RECEIVE A CERTIFICATE FOR ON WHAT. HOW AN INDIVIDUAL CHANGES THEIR MIND SET FOR THEIR APTITUDE IS HOW THEY COMPORT THEMSELVES DIFFERENTLY? AND THAT IN ITSELF BEGINS WITHIN THOSE PRISONERS BY TAKING THESE PROGRAMS I HAVE WITNESSED IT. I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT THE LIFE OF POPULATION FOR A MINUTE. WHEN I WAS AN OFFICER AND INDETERMINATE SENSE LIVE FOR AND MET WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE SAY FIFTEEN TO LIFE? WHEN I WAS A CORRECTIONAL OFFICER AND EVEN THE CAPTAIN EVEN EVEN TO THE POINT WHEN I WAS A WARDEN AT S. A. T. F.? THAT SENTENCE IN ESSENCE MEANT LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE. PAROLE DATES WERE GIVEN AND THAT WAS VERY DISCOURAGING. AND THAT WAS AT A TIME WHEN THE RECESSION HIT. PROGRAMS WERE CUT. PEOPLE THOUGHT DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THE INCARCERATED AND IT WAS REALLY HARD FOR ME AS PRISON ADMINISTRATIVE GOING TELL THE POPULATION STAYING COURAGE PARTICIPATING PROGRAM. BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T GETTING DATES. SINCE 200-014-3000 LIFERS HAVE BEEN RELEASED INTO THE COMMUNITY WITH ONLY THREE POINT ONE RECIDIVISM RATE. AND I THINK THAT NUMBER ITSELF DEMONSTRATE TO THE OTHER POPULATION THAT IF YOU PARTICIPATE IN THESE PROGRAMS THE FULL BREADTH OF THEM. REGARDLESS OF WHAT IT IS THAT HOPE IS THERE AND I CAN'T EXPRESS HOW MUCH HOPE IS IMPORTANT IN THESE PRISON SYSTEMS NOT ONLY TO THE INMATES. BUT TO THE STAFF TO FACILITATE THESE PROGRAMS. ADDITIONALLY MYSELF FROM THE SECRETARY BEFORE ME HAVE BEEN EXERCISING AUTHORITY VESTED IN THIS IN STATUTE UNDER PENAL CODE ELEVEN SEVENTY D. WHICH THERE IS A PROGRAMMING COMPONENT TO THIS. AND THAT -- THIS ELEVEN SEVENTY HAS EXISTED FOR MANY YEARS BUT WE RARELY USED IT. AND WHAT THAT DOES IT GIVE THE AUTHORITY FOR THE SECRETARY CORRECTIONS TRUST JUDGES TO REVIEW SENTENCES FOR DISCREPANCIES THAT INMATES FOR EXCEPTIONAL CONDUCT. OVER NINE HUNDRED LETTERS HAVE BEEN MAILED TO THE COURTS SINCE WE STARTED UTILIZING THIS. WE PROVIDE JUDGES WITH INFORMATION REGARDING THE PROGRAMS IN MESA PARTICIPATED IN. BUT THEY HAVE RECEIVED IN THE BENEFITS OF STAFF HAVE WITNESSED BECAUSE THEY PARTICIPATED IN THESE PROGRAMS. WE NOW SPEAK TO THEIR DISCIPLINARY HISTORY THEIR DRUG FREE HISTORY -- AND THE JUDGES HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO RE SENTENCE OR NOT. CALIFORNIA JUDGES HAVE REDUCED SENTENCES IN OVER THREE HUNDRED CASES BY A COMMUNITY OF TOTAL OF NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN YEARS. AND THAT'S DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING UTILIZED FACILITATED BY THE INSTITUTIONS FIVE LIFERS HAVE BEEN RE SENTENCED BY THE COURTS FOR THIS EXCEPTIONAL CONDUCT. THE RECIDIVISM RATE FOR INMATES BEING RELEASED FROM CDC YEAR NOW IS FORTY SIX POINT 1%. THAT'S FIVE POINT FOUR PER PERCENT LOWER THAN IT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN AT THE MAX OVERCROWDING IN EIGHT POINT 2% LOWER THAN IT IS PEAK IN. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WELL THE RESEARCHER RAISE THEM IS NOT CHANGED IT HASN'T CHANGED IN THE LAST YEAR I WANT TO POINT OUT IT I THINK IT'S ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED HERE -- IN THE PRIOR PANEL. THAT -- THAT'S BEEN STABLE EVEN THOUGH THE OFFENDERS -- THAT ARE IN PRISON NOW ARE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT AN OFFENDER'S. AND I WOULD THINK THAT. YOU KNOW YOU WOULD THINK THAT THOSE NUMBERS WILL BE GOING UP. BUT THE REMAINING STABLE AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO FUTURE RECIDIVISM NUMBER SO WITH. THAT WE WOULD GO DOWN. WE HOUSE INMATES -- DIFFERENTLY THAN WE DID IN. TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN A DECADE AGO ONLY A QUARTER OF OUR POPULATION WAS HOUSING OR MOST. PROGRAMMING FACILITIES ARE LOWER LEVELS ONLY A QUARTER OF THEM BECAUSE WE WERE THINKING DIFFERENTLY WE DIDN'T THINK THAT -- IT MAKES COULD -- BEHAVE IN A WAY THAT THEY WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE PROGRAMS BUT WE HAVE OVER A THIRD OF OUR POPULATION HOUSE AND OUR LEVEL TO LOWER LEVEL FACILITY SO NOW THESE POPULATIONS A THIRD OF THEM. ARE PARTICIPATED IN ROBUST PROGRAMMING AND THE POPULATION IS EXPECTED TO GROW IN COMING YEARS. FURTHER MORE IN MY POPULATION -- IN OUR SHOE UNITS HAS PLUMMETED ALSO. WE USED TO HOUSE INMATES I THINK WE OVER UTILIZED ISSUE. AT ONE TIME WERE AT ABOUT. FOUR THOUSAND INMATES ISSUE IN THE TERM REALLY JUST BECAUSE OF GANG STATUS AND NOW WE HAVE LISTED EIGHT HUNDRED BECAUSE WE NOW ARE UTILIZING SOME OF THOSE SAME FACILITIES WHERE WE HOUSE SHOE INMATES. TO FACILITATE AT PELICAN BAY SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS I'M TALKING ABOUT. WE ARE THINKING DIFFERENTLY WE ARE BEING INNOVATIVE WE'RE DOING A COATING PROGRAM AT PELICAN BAY WE RECENTLY HAD A GRADUATION. SO AGAIN EVEN OUR POPULATION IS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY SERIOUS COMBINED OFFENDERS. THE DEPARTMENT IS PROUD TO SAY WE'RE HOUSING AS MANY OFFENDERS AS WE CAN AT LOWER LEVELS. AT A RELATED -- AND RELATED AND THAT -- THESE MASSIVE CHANGES IN HOUSING CLASSIFICATION ACCESS TO JOBS AND PROGRAMS WE REALLY ICE WE REALLY CAN'T ISOLATE THE AFFECTS OF HOW WE'RE ABLE TO DO THIS SUCCESSFULLY ON ONE PROGRAM EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMMING. IT'S IT'S IT'S JUST A BREATH OF THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT WE SEE THE SUCCESS THAT WE'RE WITNESSING INSIDE PRISON. THE AUDITOR DID PUT OUT A REPORT THAT IS VERY CRITICAL ON HOW WE ARE NOT -- BEING AS BEING AS ACCOUNTABLE TO THIS COMMITTEE INTO THE LEGISLATURE OF THE FUNDING GIVEN TO US. AND MR SHOES IT IS GOING TO ILLUSTRATE AND TALK ABOUT WHAT WE ARE DOING. BUT I CAN SAY IF ANY OF THOSE OVERSIGHT THROUGH THE AUDIT WHICH WE DID TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY IT WASN'T THE FACT THAT. WE WE DIDN'T CARE THAT WE THOUGHT WE COULD JUST DO IT AND WE ARE NOT JUST THE STATUS QUO DEPARTMENT OF THE PAST WHAT WE SAY. IF IT WORK FIVE YEARS AGO MUST WORK TODAY WE'RE NOT THAT AGENCY. I'VE HEARD SOME COMMENTS HERE AND I APPRECIATE THEM AND I TAKE THEM TO HEART WE ARE A DIFFERENT AGENCY THAN WE WERE TEN FIFTEEN AND TWENTY YEARS AGO. SO JUST A FEW QUICK STATS AND I'M GONNA IN REAL QUICK. TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND OFFENDERS ARNOLD AN ACADEMIC PROGRAMMING. WE HAVE OVER FIVE THOUSAND INMATES IN FACE TO FACE COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN PRISON IN OUR THIRTY FIVE INSTITUTIONS. WE NOW OFFER TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED REHABILITATIVE ACHIEVEMENT THESE ARE SELF HELP TYPE PROGRAMS IN OUR INSTITUTIONS AND WE'RE GOING TO BE GROWING THEM. I WANT TO END WITH THE STORY THOUGH. IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO IT'S PROBABLY LESS THAN SIX MONTHS AGO I WAS AT A GRADUATION THE LA TRADE TECH IN LOS ANGELES FOR A SECOND CHANCE TRADES GRADUATION. AND THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT IS THE PRISON TO EMPLOYMENT -- PRISON TO APPOINTMENT CONNECTION THAT WAS SPOKE OF IN THE PRIOR PANEL THAT DOES EXIST IN THE AGENCY. THE INDIVIDUAL I SPOKE TO WAS A PART OF THIS PROGRAM. HE WAS ABLE TO UTILIZE THE CERTIFICATES THAT HE ACHIEVED IN PRISON. TO GET A JOB AND GRADUATE L. L. A. TREY TAKEN NOW HE'S HELPING BUILD THE LA RAMS STADIUM. AT THIS GRADUATION OF THE KEYNOTE SPEAKER THIS YOUNG MAN CAME TO ME AND HE SAID MISTER DE AS I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER ME. BUT WHEN YOU'RE THE WARDEN AT S. A. T. F. YOU SENT ME TO SHOE FOR DEALING DRUGS. AND I THOUGHT WELL I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS IS GOING TO GO SO I'LL JUST I'LL HEAR YOU OUT. WELL THE YOUNG MAN WAS VERY POSITIVE HE SAID YOU KNOW MISTER DE IS THAT THAT COMMITTEE YOU SAID SOMETHING TO ME. THEY CARRIED ME UNDER THE SHOE AND BROUGHT ME RIGHT WHERE I AM TODAY HE TOLD ME YOU'RE BETTER THAN THIS. YOU'RE BETTER THAN WHAT I'M READING IN THIS FILE. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT'S THE DEPARTMENT WE ARE TRYING TO BE AND IF I WOULD ASSOCIATE AND SAY. YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT WAS OUR EVIDENCE BASED. ANYTHING EVIDENCE BASED BY WHAT I TOLD THIS INDIVIDUAL ON THE PROGRAMS THAT WE SENT THEM. TO I CAN TELL YOU I I CAN'T PUT A NUMBER ON IT BUT I CAN TELL YOU I DID MEET HIS MOTHER. AMID HIS WIFE AND I MET HIS CHILD. AND FOR ME IF WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO BREAK THE CHAIN OF ACCULTURATION BY THESE PROGRAMS TO ME THAT'S THE ULTIMATE GOAL AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PUT A NUMBER OF BREAKING THE CHAIN OF ACCULTURATION. IN THE FAMILY OR COMMUNITY AND THAT IS OUR GOAL IS AN AGENCY. BY THE GRACE OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE SUPPORT OF THAT ON THE OF OUR ADMINISTRATION ARE RE HAVE BUDGET AN OPERATION WE WE ARE REALLY BEING MADE WHOLE. THE BEGINNING OF TWENTY FIFTEEN AND I SPOKE ABOUT THE RECESSION IN THE PROGRAMS WERE CUT WE WERE MADE HOLDEN. TWENTY FIFTEEN WE BROUGHT THINGS UP REALLY FAST AT THAT TIME. AND IN THE AFTERMATH WE ABSOLUTELY HADTO CLEAN UP TO DO AS POINTED OUT IN THE AUDIT. A JUST AS A STATE HONOR DESCRIBED AND I APPRECIATE THE AUDIT I DO BELIEVE IN WHAT I SAID AND EARLIER OUR UNDERSTANDING OF REHABILITATION. AND WHAT IT TAKES TO HEAL MEN AND WOMEN NOT INMATES PEOPLE. WE'RE ON THE VERGE OF A MAJOR PHILOSOPHICAL SHIFT IN THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND I'D LIKE YOUR FORBEARANCE TO SEE US THROUGH IT. I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT THAT -- AND I'M I'M I I WISH THE OTHER -- PANEL MEMBERS WERE TO STAY THE THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS LOGISTICS I DO BELIEVE SOME OF THE RESPONSES WERE GONNA SEVE -- HERE AT THE DIRECTION THAT I GAVE THE DIVISION OF REAL BITS AT A PROGRAM ONCE IT OUGHT TO CAME OUT WE NEED ANSWERS YOU NEEDED ANSWERS. SENATE TURNED OVER TO OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR TO TALK ABOUT THE CAP TO SPEAK TO THE DIRECTION I GAVE AND WHAT WE ARE. WITH THE AUDIT. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT AWESOME QUESTIONS IT'S A GOOD STORY THAT YOU SURE SO WAS FALL QUESTIONS OF THE LOS PLEASE MR SAYS. GOOD AFTERNOON TERRY MEMBERS -- ONCE AGAIN MY NAME'S RYAN SEES ON THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE DIVISION OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS. I WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TAKE SOME ADDITIONAL TIME TO DISCUSS OUR REHABILITATE ABOUT IT. THE FINDINGS THAT SOME OF THE WORK THAT IS CURRENTLY UNDER WAY WITHIN THE DIVISION. I'M AS NOTED IN THE AUDIT RESPONSES CDC ARE GENERALLY AGREES WITH THE FINDINGS -- REGARDING ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES -- WHICH ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE WORK THAT WE'VE ALREADY BEGUN -- IN LATE. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE IN TERMS OF THE AUDIT FINDINGS NOTHING WAS A SURPRISE TO THE D. R. P. ADMINISTRATION. IN LATE -- TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE STARTED AS THE DOWN INTO A FACT FINDING DISCUSSION ABOUT THE PROGRAMS THAT HAD SUBSTANTIALLY ROLLED OUT. WE FULLY UNDERSTOOD AND APPRECIATED OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO IMPLEMENT PROGRAMMING TO ENHANCE THE PRISON ENVIRONMENT IMPACT PUBLIC SAFETY AND BE TRANSPARENT AND NOT WORK -- I WILL TAKE A COUPLE MINUTES TO JUST DISCUSS EACH OF THEM I'M AND AND THEN BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AFTERWARDS. AGAIN IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE SAT DOWN AS A GROUP WE STARTED A FACT FINDING MISSION TO SAY WHAT ARE ALL THE REASONS THAT -- ADMINISTRATIVELY THESE PROGRAMS WOULD NOT BE AS EFFECTIVE AS THEY SHOULD BE OR WHEN WE GO TO DO FUTURE RESEARCH WHERE THERE WOULD BE -- LACKING OUTCOMES BECAUSE OF CERTAIN VARIABLES THAT IMPACT ABOUT RESEARCH WE SAT DOWN AND REALLY WALK THROUGH EACH OF THOSE THINGS THAT OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS WE REALLY DISCUSSED THOSE THINGS -- AND WORKED ON SOLIDIFYING IN WHICH IS GOING TO BE A REPRESENTED IN THE AUDIT FINDINGS AND AND IS WHY WE ARE ABLE TO DO IT. AND A SUCH A SHORT TIME. SO IN THE FIRST TWO FISCAL YEARS WE BEGIN WORK WITH THAT P. RESULTS FIRST CLEARING HOUSE THAT WORK REALLY GAVE US INSIGHT INTO THE BROAD CURRICULA THAT WAS. ON THE REPRESENTED IN OUR CORRECTIONAL EXCUSE ME IN OUR PROGRAMS -- WE CATEGORIZE THAT WE REVIEWED IT WITH THE RESULTS FIRST CURRICULUM IT WAS RELATED TO OUR TREATMENT PROGRAMS ARE COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT WHICH WAS REVIEWED BY THE AUDITOR. THAT GAVE THE R. P. THE ABILITY TO UNDERSTANDING CATEGORIES HOW TO WORK WITH RESULTS FIRST TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS OF THE RESULTS FIRST CLEARING HOUSE THAT IS EVIDENCE BASED ON RESEARCH TO NOT CLEARING HOUSE. AND HE GAVE US THE ABILITY TO FOCUS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF CURRICULA COLOR COLLECTION AND CASE MANAGEMENT. AND SO. THROUGH THAT EFFORT WE INITIALLY SAID OKAY THERE ARE -- BASICALLY WHAT WAS REPRESENTED THE AUDIT ABOUT 20% OF OUR CURRICULUM WHICH HAS NOT BEEN -- EVIDENCE BASED AND RESEARCHED AND IS CONTAINED WITHIN THE FEW RESULTS FIRST CLEARING HOUSE NOW IT MIGHT BE EVIDENCE BASED IT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR DECADES IN SOME CASES BUT NIGHT MIGHT NOT HAVE JUST BEEN ANY EVIDENCE BASED RESEARCH WITHIN CLEARING -- THE RESULTS FIRST CLEARING HOUSE SO WE SAID LET'S FOCUS ON DATA COLLECTION AN EXTRACTION NOW THAT WE'VE GOTTEN THAT FIGURE BECAUSE THAT IS ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS I THINK THE DEPARTMENT HAS ALWAYS HISTORICALLY STRUGGLED WITH. IS REALLY SAYING THAT WE HAVE THE DATA AVAILABLE. WE FINALIZE THE CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT WAS RELATED TO TREATMENT IN THE LAST TWO YEARS -- ROLLED OUT ROBUSTLY AND NOT ALLOWED US TO GET INSIGHT INTO TREATMENT PLANS CASE NOTES -- ENROLLMENT WITHIN OUR TREATMENT PROGRAMS TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE WHEN WE LOOK AT ACCOUNTABILITY INFIDELITY IN THE FUTURE -- THAT CASE MANAGEMENT PLAN COMBINED WITH OUR TEAM SITTING DOWN AND DEVELOPING OR CREATING HUNDREDS OF COUNTING RULES AND BUSINESS RULES RELATED TO OUR STRATEGIC OFFENDER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. REALLY COLLECTS AT THIS POINT MILLIONS OF INMATE LEVEL DATA POINTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO US FOR FUTURE OUTCOME EVALUATIONS OUTPUT EVALUATIONS AND CONSTANT OPERATIONAL MONITORING. DON'T THE STAR THIRD THING WE REALLY FOCUSED ON WAS -- PRIORITIZE PLACEMENT. THAT'S MENTIONED IN THE AUDIT REPORT A NUMBER OF TIMES RELATED TO THE WAIT LIST OR AN ACCURATE PLACEMENT PROGRAMS WE RECOGNIZE THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS. THEY HAD AN ARCHAIC PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF PLACING PEOPLE THEY WERE VALUABLE WHEN THEY WERE CREATED BUT WHAT IT TOOK WAS AN INDIVIDUAL ANALYSIS OF OFTEN ARE IN ME TO SIGN IN OFFICE. TO SAY WHO WAS PRIORITIZE BASED ON MEMORANDUMS THAT WE HAD SUBMIT OUR WITH THAT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED IN TERMS OF POLICY THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE IN A SYSTEM THIS LARGE AND COMPLEX. SO IN LATE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN LONG BEFORE THE AUDIT WE BEGAN WORK WITH OUR STRATEGIC OFFENDER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM UPDATE THE BACK END OF THE SYSTEM IN THOSE WAIT LIST SO THAT WE ARE PRIORITIZING PEOPLE IN THE RIGHT MANNER. CONSISTENT WITH THE POLICIES THAT WE PUT IN PLACE -- AND TO RELY ON TECHNOLOGY SO THAT WE CAN START NOT ONLY RELYING ON TECHNOLOGY BUT MAKE DATA DRIVEN DECISIONS BASED ON THAT TECHNOLOGY. SO WE ISSUED IN THAT TERM -- CLEAR POLICY DIRECTIVES -- IN LATE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FOCUSING ON THOSE RISKS TO RE OFFEND AND THOSE CRIMINAL GENIC NEEDS -- AGAIN POLICY DIRECTIVES ARE ARE NOT IDEAL BECAUSE THEY DO NOT RELY ON THE TECHNOLOGY AND THAT'S WHEN WE BEGIN THAT WORK WITH THE TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS -- THAT TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM THE WAIT LIST -- AS MENTIONED BY THE SEA OTTER AND IN PREVIOUS HEARINGS WENT INTO EFFECT THIS WEEK AND THAT CREATES AN AUTOMATED PRIORITIZATION FOR AWAY THE SO WE EXPECT TO SEE SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH. IN THE PLACING THE RIGHT IN MADE IN THE RIGHT PROGRAM AT THE RIGHT TIME -- THAT WILL HELP LEVERAGE ALL OF THE STUFF THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON AND MAKING SURE THAT IT'S MOVING FORWARD. WE ALSO IN THIS PROCESS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS -- DEVELOPED TO DATA ANALYTICS TOOLS FOR OPERATIONAL USE THOSE DATA ANALYTICS TOOLS CAN MONITOR PEOPLE BOTH IN PROGRAMMING TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE THE RIGHT PERSON IN THE RIGHT PROGRAM. AND THEY'RE AVAILABLE TO OUR CORRECTIONAL COUNSELORS IN THE FIELD AND WILL BE AVAILABLE IN THE NEAR FUTURE TO PRINCIPLES AND EVERYONE ELSE THAT HAS AND ONCE ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION SO THAT THEY CAN. ON THE FLY IN REAL TIME SEE HOW THEY'RE INTERACTING WITH THEIR POPULATIONS AND MAKE SURE AGAIN THAT THEY HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO HELP THEM SO THEY'RE NOT INDIVIDUALLY PULLING PEOPLE UP AND SEEING IF THERE PRIORITIZE FOR PROGRAMMING. AGAIN -- THOSE TWO DATA ANALYTICS TOOLS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN THE LAST TWO YEARS -- AND THEN WE ALSO -- ARE AROUND PERFORMANCE ACCOUNTABILITY INFIDELITY WAS A HEAVY TOPIC IN THE AUDIT ABOUT ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES WE RECOGNIZED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THAT IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE PROPER ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURES AND SITE. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO MEASURE IT AND IT OFTEN IMPACTS RECIDIVISM ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO FIDELITY. WE BEGAN WORK -- I STATED IN THE AUDIT -- IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE TO CREATE TWO TOOLS THOSE TOOLS ARE OUR PROGRAM ACCOUNTABILITY REVIEW TOOL -- WHICH ESSENTIALLY MONITORS CONTRACT COMPLIANCE -- AT THE VERY MINUTE LEVEL THAT IS ONLY ABLE TO BE ACCOMPLISHED BECAUSE OF THE CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WE ARE ALSO ROLLING OUT AT THE SAME TIME AND OUR DATA COLLECTION EFFORTS SO WE KNOW THAT THESE -- ITEMS ARE ALL INTERTWINED AND ARE PART OF THE SUCCESS IN THE FUTURE -- THAT WE PLAN ON DISPLAYING. THAT PROGRAM ACCOUNTABILITY TOLD WAS FINALIZED IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND WE DID STAFF TRANING -- AND SOME PILOTING FOR THE FIRST COUPLE OF MONTHS AND THAT'S WHAT WAS ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED IN JANUARY OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE ARE DOING STATEWIDE ASSESSMENTS ON PROGRAM ACCOUNTABILITY AT THIS POINT -- AND WE PLAN ON DOING TWO TO THREE OF THOSE ASSESSMENTS EACH YEAR SO WE HAVE MEASURABLE MARKERS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. IN ADDITION TO THAT WE HAD DEVELOPED WITH UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE -- PROGRAM FIDELITY MARKERS AND TOOLS AND REPORTS AND THAT IS AGAIN A PRODUCT OF OUR DATA COLLECTION EFFORTS IN OUR CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT WE ROLLED OUT -- CONCURRENTLY. THOSE FIDELITY MEASURES ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS OF PROGRAMMING IF THE THERE'S NO EFFICACY TO THE PROGRAM IT'S NOT BEING INTENDED -- IT'S NOT BEING IMPLEMENTED AS IT WAS INTENDED WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE JUST BEAR IMPACTS AND ULTIMATELY AFFECTS ON RECIDIVISM. SO ALL OF THOSE THINGS REALLY ADDRESS A LOT OF WHAT THE AUDITOR -- RECKON -- RECOMMENDS AND THOSE ARE SOME OF THE RESPONSES WE'VE DEVELOPED ADDITIONALLY WE'VE DEVELOPED WEEKLY BASED ON THOSE DATA POINTS AND A CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WE DEVELOPED A WEEKLY OPERATIONAL REPORTS SO THAT WE CAN MAKE REAL TIME DECISIONS ON PLACES WHERE THERE'S LACKING ENROLLMENT. OR LOWER CAPACITY WE HAVE MONTHLY OPERATIONAL REPORTS THAT WE NOW SEND OUT -- AND THAT HAVE DEVELOPED THAT DEAL WITH -- ATTENDANCE -- COULD PERCENTAGES WE NEED TO WE HAVE GOALS AND MARKERS RELATED COMPLETIONS GOALS AND MARKERS RELATED TO ENROLLMENT ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE DEVELOPED IN IN PLACE AND HAVE BEEN IN PLACE. NOW FOR A YEAR THE AUDITOR -- HAD MENTIONED THAT WE HAD NOT FORMALLY DEVELOPED -- PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND WE HAVE -- IN TERMS OF ATTENDANCE COMPLETIONS ENROLLMENTS THOSE TYPES OF THINGS ARE NOW IN OUR MONTHLY REPORTS AND THEY HAVE BEEN INFORMALLY WELL WE HAVEN'T DEVELOPED IN WHAT WE PLAN ON DEVELOPING WITH RESEARCH IS REALLY MAKING THOSE DATA DRIVEN DECISIONS. ON RECIDIVISM REDUCTIONS THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK WE STILL HAVE TO WORK ON TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE APPROPRIATELY FINING THOSE MARKERS -- AND THEN FINALLY THE RESEARCH IT'S A BIG TOPIC WE KNEW WE WANTED TO IMPLEMENT ALL OF THESE THINGS BECAUSE OUR FEAR WAS HIRING A RESEARCHER HAVING ENOUGH QUANTITY WHICH NEEDED ENOUGH LONGITUDINAL DATA AFTER THE ROLL OUT OF THE ARE PEOPLE COMING. AND THEN HAVING THAT RESEARCHER COME BACK AND SAY WELL YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN COLLECTING THIS OR YOU REALLY IT MIGHT BE RELATED TO THE FIDELITY AND I REALLY TO BE RELATED TO THE CONTRACT ACCOUNTABILITY. SO ALL OF THESE PIECES COME TOGETHER TO SAY AS WE HAVE ENOUGH LONGITUDINAL DATA WHICH IS STILL LIMITED AT THIS POINT WE BELIEVE THAT OUR RESEARCH UPON WILL HAVE EVERYTHING THEY NEED TO MAKE REALLY RELEVANT DECISIONS. ON PROGRAMMING AND ITS SUCCESS -- SO THAT'S A IN GENERAL -- THE STUFF THAT WE REALLY FOCUSED ON I DID WANT TO GO BACK AND JUST TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE LONGITUDINAL DATA WHICH OFTEN COMES UP -- SECRETARY TIAS MENTIONED IT AND IN. TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN HIS MERE BLUEPRINT WHICH WAS TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THIRTEEN TO THE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN WE HAD I HAD A BASE LEVEL OF OUR PROGRAMS IN. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN WE EXPANDED TO TEN ADDITIONAL INSTITUTIONS FOR SUBSTANCE USE. AND IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN WE EXPANDED ALL OF OUR C. B. T. PROGRAM SO THE REMAINING INSTITUTIONS THAT WERE NOT INCLUDED IN BROUGH BLUEPRINT. AND EXPANDED C. B. T. AT ALL OF OUR PROGRAM SO IN THAT SHORT TIME PERIOD WE COMPLETELY ARE. YOU KNOW ROLLED OUT A MASSIVE -- PROGRAM FOR D. R. P. RELATED TO C. B. T. TREATMENT SO SOME OF THAT COMPONENT IS REALLY WAITING FOR THE LONGITUDINAL DATA TO MAKE SURE THAT RESEARCHERS HAVE THAT THE CAPACITY. TO MEASURE BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SO -- FEW FISCAL YEAR SINCE THE ROLLOUT. AND SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE IN TERMS OF REALLY PUTTING IN PROCESSES IN PLACE THE RISK IN NEEDS TOOLS THAT THE AUDITOR MENTIONEDARE ABSOLUTELY RELEVANT TO OUR PLACE AND PROGRAMS WE IDENTIFIED BATHROOM SECRETARY D. AS A NUMBER OF OTHER STAKEHOLDERS IN THE DEPARTMENT. THAT ARE CURRENTLY HAVING A WORK GROUP AS THEY REFERENCE AND THEY'RE COMING BACK WITH RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING FOR THOSE RISK ANY TOOLS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PUTTING IN PLACE. THE SAME THING WITH -- THE SPACE SURVEY AND CONTRACTS FOR RESEARCH WE ARE ACTIVELY AND AGGRESSIVELY ENGAGING ON THESE THE SPACE SURVEYS WE ARE KIND OF CURRENTLY CONDUCTING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING IT CORRECTLY. PART OF WHAT WE WANTED TO AVOID IN TERMS OF A SPACE SURVEY IS D. R. P. ACTING IN A SILO WHEN THERE'S OTHER DIVISIONAL THINGS HAPPENING AND GOING OUT AND ATTEMPTING TO SAY WE HAVE A DEFICIT IN SPACE WHAT WE'RE DOING IS. AS A DEPARTMENT REALLY GETTING TOGETHER AND SAYING WE ALL NEED TO BE GOING OUT HERE WE ALL NEED TO BE ASSESSING THIS TOGETHER SO THAT WE ARE NOT HAVING A SHOVING MATCH ON WHO SHOULD BE WHERE. AND SO THAT'S ACTIVELY HAPPENING AT THIS POINT. AND WE'RE BEGINNING TO DEVELOP A PLAN OF ACTION ON HOW TO GET OUT THERE WE DO EXPECT THAT TO TAKE SOME TIME BECAUSE IT IS THE VERY LOCAL LEVEL THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PROGRAMS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE OUR ACCOUNTED. FOR BUT THAT IS BEGINNING AND THEN THE LAST THING. BUT I JUST WANTED TO MENTION WAS -- THAT THE RESEARCH CONTRACTING POINTS WE HAVE BEEN HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH RESEARCHERS BUT WE DIDN'T WANT ENGAGE THEM TOO EARLY BECAUSE GETTING INTO A CONTRACT BEFORE THEY CAN ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH THE RESEARCH WAS NOT WHAT WERE OUR INTENTION -- WHAT WE DO WANT TO WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND THE AUDITOR'S AN ABSOLUTELY SUBMIT ANY SCOPES OF WORK AND WE THINK THAT THE SCOPES OF WORK WILL GENERALLY BE DRAFTED -- LONG BEFORE OUR APRIL TIMELINE THAT WE HAD REFERENCE IN TERMS OF THE CONTRACT EXECUTION SO WE'RE HAPPY TO SHARE ANY OF THAT INFORMATION AGAIN SOMETHING THAT I PRIDE MYSELF IN. IS REALLY ATTEMPTING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE BEING TRANSPARENT AND I'M HAPPY TO HELP -- AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE AUDITOR UPDATES WITH ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT WILL BE DOING. THAT THE LAST THING IS -- SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE HAS TALKED ABOUT A BIT TODAY WHICH I APPRECIATE IS DEAR P. -- IN TERMS OF OUR CONVERSATIONS WE UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITIES OF RACISM -- RECIDIVISM ANALYSIS AND DATA LIMITATIONS AND WE RETREAT WE THINK THERE IS NO SILVER BULLET TO RECIDIVISM EVERYONE MENTIONED HERE TODAY THAT IT CREATES A LAYERED APPROACH WE MUST EDUCATE -- INMATES WHILE THEY'RE INCARCERATED LAYER TIME SPRINT -- SPENT IN PRISON WITHIN WITH ACTIVITY GROUPS THAT ARE LED BY OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS CONNECT TO OUR TREATMENT PROGRAMS PRIOR TO RELEASE. CONNECT IN THE COMMUNITY REENTRY RESOURCES AFTER RELEASE AND THEN ULTIMATELY CREATE COLLABORATIONS WITH THE COUNTY TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT SO ALL OF THOSE THINGS CREATE. THE ANALYSIS THAT WERE AIMING FOR SO THAT WE CAN'T LOOK AT SOMETHING -- IN A TARGET WE CAN LOOK AT IT HOLISTICALLY THIS EVERY MEETING THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF THESE -- INMATES AND THEN AS WAS MENTIONED HERE TODAY THERE THE NEEDS VASTLY ARE VASTLY DIFFERENT. AND WE MUST PROVIDE THIS FOUNDATIONAL PIECES -- I I WOULD YOU KNOW HAVE MORE TO DISCUSS ON THE ON EVIDENCE BASED BUT I THINK EVERYONE HERE STATED EXACTLY WHAT I HAD ORIGINALLY WRITTEN DOWN. IT'S THAT -- THERE ARE CERTAIN PROGRAMS THAT WE BELIEVE SHOULD BE EVIDENCE BASED AND CONTAINED WITHIN THE RESULTS FIRST CLEARING HOUSE AND THOSE ARE TREATMENT PROGRAMS WE THINK THAT THE INTERVENTION OUR CURRICULUM LEVEL THAT'S APPROPRIATE FOR A TREATMENT PROGRAM. BUT I'D JUST LIKE -- MISTER JONES SAWYER NOTED WE WANNA TAKE CAUTION AND BEING TOO EXTREME IN THAT -- INTERPRETATION BECAUSE IT LEAVES OUT COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN WITH THE EUROPEAN THIS DEPARTMENT THROUGH THICK AND THIN WHEN THEY WERE YOU KNOW NGUYEN REHABILITATION WAS TAKEN AWAY ARE MINIMIZED -- OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WERE THERE AND I GO OUT TODAY AND GET TO SEE THE IMPACTS OF A PARENT READING TO A CHILD ARTS CLASSES THAT HAVE. DIFFERENT RACES COMING TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DESCRIBING THAT TO ME AND THOSE IMPACTS I KNOW EXIST AND THAT'S WHERE WE WANTED TO FIND WITH RESEARCHERS -- IT DIDN'T IT DOESN'T HAVE TO JUST BE ABOUT -- RECIDIVISM THAT IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL AND WE SHOULD BE MEASURING THAT BUT WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL HOW ARE THEY OUTPUTTING CHANGES RIGHT NOW HOW ARE THEY REDUCING RIGHT UP POWER THERE LESS VIOLENCE ON THE ARTS THOSE ARE ALL THINGS WE BELIEVE WE CAN MEASURE. WE BELIEVE THAT -- THESE PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDING SUBSTANTIAL BENEFIT TO THE THE POPULATION -- THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TAKE THE TIME TO DISCUSS THESE THINGS -- I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE AUDIT OR THINGS THAT WERE IMPLEMENTING THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IN ON THAT LAST POINT I KNOW I'LL BE INTERESTED IN HEARING WHAT THE NEXT PANEL HAS A SAY ON SOME OF THOSE -- SOME OF THE DISCUSSION UP HERE HAS BEEN YOU KNOW THE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN ALL THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS A CVT PROGRAMS AND THEN. SOME OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT WE'VE ALREADY MENTIONED -- NOT WITHSTANDING THAT AT FIRST OF QUESTIONS I'D LIKE TO ASK JUST KIND OF BASED OFF THE AUDITOR'S PRESENTATION AND MAYBE WE JUST START. START THERE KNOWING THAT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ALL THE PROGRAMS AND HOW WE ACTUALLY MEASURE THOSE OUTCOMES BUT LIKE YOU SAID A CHILD. READING TOO I MEAN -- A FORMER INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL EADING TO THEIR CHILD YOU KNOW THERE BE A METRIC THERE TO SHOW THAT THEY DID NOT GO BACK INTO PRISON. AS WELL AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS IS. HOW? HISTORICALLY HOW ARE WE MOVING TO ACTUALLY IMPROVE THOSE ANALYTICS YOU KNOW EARLIER WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT -- YOU KNOW COMPASS AND CS ARE A BUT WHAT IS PART IT MOVING AND I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS SAYING YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T SAME DEPARTMENT AS FIVE YEARS AGO WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THINGS DIFFERENTLY AND HOW WE'RE DOING THAT AND SO YOU KNOW. TO BE A LOT OF THE AUDIT IS YOU MAY BE DOING GREAT PROGRAMS BUT WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE ANALYTICS OR THE DATE AND ACTUALLY BACK THAT UP. AND I THINK YOU'RE HEARING FOR MEMBERS OF THE BIASES WE WANT TO JUST MAKE SURE THAT THOSE PROGRAMS ARE WORKING EFFECTIVELY WE CONTINUE THEM IN THOSE THAT ARE NOT. MAYBE WE RE THINK ABOUT HOW WE DO THAT APPROACH -- WE TO BOLSTER UP THOSE PROGRAMS THAT ARE. AND SO IF YOU COULD JUST SPEAK TO YOU KNOW GOING FROM COMPASS AND C. C. S. R. A. AND HOW WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING THAT -- I THINK THAT BE BENEFICIAL FOR US. I'LL SPEAK TO CAMPUS -- COMPASS HAS BEEN WITH AS A PART OF OUR ASSESSMENT TOOLS ON HOW WE'RE GOING TO ASSIGN INMATES. TO PROGRAMS AND WHAT WE FOUND AS WE IMPLEMENTED IT'S IT'S NOT A DYNAMIC TOOL. IT IS VERY STATIC. WHAT WE FIND IS THAT AS INDIVIDUAL STAR PARTICIPATED IN PROGRAMS FOR THE BE? EDUCATION LOCATION OR NONTRADITIONAL PROGRAMMING OR YOUR SELF HELP GROUPS. EVEN THOUGH WE HAD ACHIEVEMENTS AN INDIVIDUAL GOT EDUCATED THEN DID RECEIVE CERTIFICATES. THERE'S NO METRIC TO CHANGE WITH THE COMPASS AND WE NEEDED MORE DYNAMIC ASSESSMENT -- I WANT THAT'S WHY WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THAT NEED AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE NOT LOOKING FOR THAT TOOL. WE'RE LOOKING AT AT THE STATE'S WE'RE LOOKING AT OTHER AGENCIES ON WHAT IS THE BEST TOOL TO USE AND WHAT IS DYNAMIC AND HOW IT CAN BE MORE -- USEFUL AT THE ON A YEAR BY YEAR BASIS SO THE CORRECTIONAL COUNSELOR CAN DO ASSESSMENTS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS INDIVIDUAL INDIVIDUAL AS A GROWN PROGRESS IN THE REHABILITATION. AS THEY GET CLOSER TO THEIR PAROLE DATES AS WE GET CLOSER TO BOARD DATES ARE THEY IN THE RIGHT PROGRAM AND IT'S JUST -- IT IN WHAT WE FOUND IS IT THESE ARE NOT TOOLS IN THESE ARE TOOLS THAT ARE OFF THE SHELF THAT FIT PERFECTLY WITH CDC ARE. AND THE LAST WE WANT TO DO IS GET A A TOOL OR AN ASSESSMENT TOOL AND PLUG IT IN. AND FIND OUT A YEAR LATER IT DOESN'T WORK FOR US. THAT'S WHY WE'RE TAKING THIS CAUTIOUS APPROACH WE ARE WORKING WITH -- VARIOUS OTHER WE'RE LOOKING AT OTHER AGENCIES BUT INTERNALLY WE HAVE DIVISION OF RESEARCH A DIVISION OF AUDITING AND COMPLIANCE AND THEY ARE IN THIS ALSO ALONG WITH THE VISION OF REALLY BUDGET A PROGRAM. TO FIND THAT TOOL -- WHETHER WE HAVE TO DEVELOP BETTER ON OUR OWN BUILD OUR OWN OR PICK ONE OFF THE SHELF I THINK THE MOST IDEAL IS TO MAKE IT OFF THE SHELF IN ITS PLUG AND PLAY. BUT WE FIND IS IT MAY WORK FOR THE FIRST YEAR BUT ASK CORRECTIONS EVOLVES AND AS PROGRAMS CHANGING AS WE SEE GROWTH. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE ONE IN PLACE AT ITS -- IS JUST AS DYNAMIC AS THE DEPARTMENT IS RIGHT NOW. AND HAS IDENTIFIED AS A DEPARTMENT IDENTIFIED MAYBE A PROGRAM OFF THE SHELF OR SOMETHING THAT WOULD ACTUALLY HELP. AT THOSE ANALYTICS AND DRIVE THAT DATA. I HAVE I HAVE A BRIEFING FROM THAT GROUP -- THIS MONTH -- AND THE INITIAL INFORMATION I DID RECEIVE I WASN'T SATISFIED BECAUSE THE SOUND A LOT LIKE COMPASS. IN THIS WITH A DIFFERENT PRODUCT TO YOU -- AND THEY REGION FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND WE'RE VERY CAUTIOUS IN WHO WOULD BRING IN ON IT HAS TO FIT OUR MOLD AS HAS TO FIT OUR NEEDS NOT THEIR FINANCIAL NEED. CORRECT AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO SEE RIGHT. NOW AS WE DRIVE TO THIS BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS YOU KNOW FOR MY PERSPECTIVE. YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID WE'VE THREE YEARS AGO WE DID THE SIXTY FOUR MILLION BUT FOR FOR PUTTING MONEY INTO THE ARE PART OF CDC ARE THE RE HAVE BUT THEN WHEN WE HERE WE SEE AUDIT. TALKING ABOUT EMPTY SEATS ARE UNDER UTILIZATION I WOULD CALL IT. AND YOU KNOW THAT I'M HEARING FROM THE DEPARTMENTS WELL WE DON'T HAVE. PROGRAMS OR MAYBE IS IT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS IT ADMINISTRATIVE IS A PROGRAM HOW DO WE CAPITALIZE ON THE INVESTMENTS WE MADE ON THE OUR PART AND THEN THE SECOND PART OF THAT IS. ACTUALLY SEEING THE ANALYTICS TO SAY THAT PEOPLE ARE AYE I HAVE SEVERAL RESPONSES OF AND I REALLY DON'T WANT TO COME OFF AS DEFENSIVE AND ALL THESE MAKING AN EXCUSE BECAUSE I DON'T ACCEPT THAT FROM MY PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR ME. BUT I CAN SAY THAT THE DATA THAT WAS USED FROM. FOURTEEN FIFTEEN THE SHIPS THAT WERE GOING ON WITHIN CORRECTIONS AND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN EVERYTHING I'VE EXPLAINED FROM. BRINGING DOWN A SECURITY HOUSING UNITS CHANGING HOW WE CLASSIFY INMATES TAKING GREATER -- ALLOWING INMATES WHO AT ONE TIME WE WOULD NEVER PUT AT LOWER LEVELS -- ON YARDS THAT WE THINK THAT -- THAT THE TWO DANGERS TO BE ON THE RECOGNIZING THE GOING HOME ANYWAY. I WOULD RATHER THAN PAROLE FROM THE LOWER LEVEL FACILITIES -- EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY HAVE A TRADITIONAL WRIST LEVEL THAT WE'RE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THAT THE REALITIES ARE GOING HOME. AND I NEED THEM ON FACILITIES WHERE THEY HAVE -- ACCESS TO PROGRAMS ACCESS TO LOWER -- MORE PROGRAM RICH OPPORTUNITIES BUT THE PROBLEM WAS. WE HAD POLICY CHANGES IN PLACE WE HAD -- FACILITY SHIFT IN POPULATION WHICH IN ESSENCE CREATES VACANCIES AND SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS OTHER ISSUES THAT WE HAD TO HAVE A WE HAVE WORK THROUGH. AND SO I KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE AN EXCUSE BUT WE HAD A SHIFT IN HOW WE HOUSE WHERE WE HOUSE AND WHAT TIME WE HOUSING EVEN. THERE WERE TIMES WHEN WE DIDN'T EVEN ALLOW INMATES OUT AFTER A CERTAIN TIME. WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN CERTIN INMATES WEREN'T LET OUT OF THEIR CELLS? WHICH WAS WHICH WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR I HAVE MORE SPACE IN PRISONS BECAUSE FOR PROGRAMMING BECAUSE THOSE CLASSROOMS AT TRADITIONALLY ARE THERE FROM. EIGHT TO FOUR ARE BEING UTILIZED FROM FIVE TO WHENEVER. BUT BECAUSE OF SECURITY CONCERNS ON OUR AND WE HAD TO CHANGE POLICY AND THAT TOOK TIME. SO HOW DO YOU BALANCE -- FULFILLING THOSE VACANCIES WITH THE SECURITY CONCERNS. RIGHT NOW THE BALANCE IS WE ARE LOOKING AT THE REHABILITATIVE NEEDS OF THE IN MAY AND WE BASE HIS CURRENT BEHAVIOR AND WHERE WE PUT HIM NOT HIS PAST BEHAVIOR. HIS CURRENT BE HERE RECOGNIZING THAT HE NEEDS A REHABILITATIVE OPPORTUNITY. THAT TOOK TIME A CULTURE SHIFT INSIDE THE PRISON FOR STAFF. AND SOME OF THE FACILITATORS ALSO BECAUSE IT IS A HUGE SEA CHANGE THAT WHY ARE YOU ALLOWING MORE INMATES OUT IN THESE PROGRAMS AT THESE TIMES. AND AS IT AT THE TIME I WAS THE UNDERSECRETARY EVEN DEPUTY DIRECTOR TELLING THESE WARDENS BECAUSE ARE GOING HOME. WE NEED TO GIVE THEM ON OUR PART OPPORTUNITY WE NEED TO GET THEM TO THESE LOWER LEVEL FACILITIES. IT TOOK TIME. IT WAS A CULTURE SHIFT WITHIN OUR PRISON SYSTEM FOR OUR WARDENS AND OUR CUSTODY STAFF IN OUR CUSTODY SUFFER MORE ENGAGED. BECAUSE THEY SEE THE CHANGE THEY SEE THAT THEY ARE TAKING PART IN THE REHABILITATIVE PROCESS OF THE IN RIGHT NOW WHICH WHICH WILL. WHICH IS LEAD TO BETTER NUMBERS UTILIZATION IN THESE PROGRAMS. I WISH I HAD MORE SPACE AND GOT TALKED ABOUT A LITTLE BIT EARLIER THE SPACE ISSUES I KNOW THERE WE DO HAVE -- ROOF ISSUES WE DO HAVE FACILITY IMPROVEMENT ISSUES AND THAT'S THE DISCUSSION THAT THAT WE ARE IN -- IN THE BUDGET DISCUSSION NOW AND THIS REALLY GEARED TOWARDS. FINDING MORE SPACE SO WE CAN PROVIDE BETTER UP REHABILITATIVE OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE WHEN THESE PRISONS WERE BUILT WHAT WE HAVE A LOT OF OUR INMATES. THE BILL FROM THE EIGHTIES TO THE TWO THOUSANDS. THE PRISONERS THAT WERE BUILT WEREN'T BUILT WITH REHABILITATION IN MIND. I I I'M FROM THAT ERA I WAS AN OFFICER DURING THOSE TIMES THEY WERE BUILT WITH SECURITY IN MIND NOTHING ELSE. YOU GOT YOUR EDUCATION CLASSES A FEW VOCATIONAL CLASSES AND THAT'S IT. NOW SOME OF OUR OLDER PRISONS THEY WERE BUILT WITH REHABILITATION IN MIND LIKE ARE SAYING CLINTON'S ARE CHINOS ARE NOR BECAUSE THAT WAS A TIME WHEN THE DEPARTMENT REALLY BELIEVE IN REHABILITATION. WE DIDN'T WE WE FORGET ABOUT THOSE DAYS BUT I'M TRYING TO REMIND THE AGENCY AND THE STAFF THAT THOSE DAYS ARE STILL HERE BUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A SPACE. AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE LEADING INMATES OUT AT NIGHT BEYOND TRADITIONAL TIMES WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SECURE FUNDING TO HIRE ADDITIONAL STAFF TO FACILITATE SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS IN AREAS WHERE I DON'T HAVE STAFFING IN THE EVENING. SO WE CAN FACILITATE THESE PROGRAMS. SO IS IT JUST A SCHEDULING THING IS A RESOURCES I MEAN ASIDE FROM THE CLASSROOMS BUT I'M JUST SAYING FOR THE FILLING OF THE VACANCIES. FOR TEACHERS AND AND WHAT ARE NOT DIRECTOR SAYS THE CAN SPEAK ON THE TEACHERS BUT I DO KNOW THAT -- ON THE VOCATIONAL TRADES THE VOCATIONAL TRADE WE DO STRUGGLE AND HIRING SOME OF THOSE -- INSTRUCTORS BECAUSE OF FORTUNATE ENOUGH -- THE STATE WHAT WERE THOSE ROBUST BUILDING GOING ON SO THAT INSTRUCTORS WHO USED TO TRADITIONALLY COMING TO WORK ON OUR PRISONS. THE GORE CONSTRUCTION OUTSIDE THE MAY MAKE MORE MONEY IS MORE FLEXIBLE -- DURING THE DOWNTURN WE HAD STAFFING. BECAUSE THE THERE WASN'T A WHOLE LOT OF BUILDING FOR THE AGGRESSIVE APPROACH IN THE DIRECTION I GAVE THE R. P. IS THE RECRUITMENT EFFORTS NEED TO BE NONTRADITIONAL GOING IN THE AREAS THAT WE WOULDN'T THINK OF GOING HITTING. SCHOOLS DIRECTLY HITTING VOCATIONAL SCHOOL DIRECTLY AND SO THE MARKETS THAT I HAVE PUT ON DEAR PETE TO COME UP WITH NUMBERS. THEY NEED TO BE THINKING AND AND AND GOING INTO AREAS THAT THEY TRADITIONALLY WOULD GO. AND ALSO HIRING FORMERLY INCARCERATED NO. OUR DEVELOP AN OPERATIONAL FOR REPORTS WAS TO CREATE WEEKLY AND MONTHLY REPORTS FOR NOT ONLY TO SEE THE TREATMENT OF OCCASIONAL INSTRUCTORS ACADEMIC INSTRUCTOR SO WE CAN -- ROOF QUICKLY SEE WHERE VACANCIES EXIST AND REACT TO THOSE VACANCIES AND JUST LIKE SECRETARY D. AS MENTIONED WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING CREATED WE CAN FROM GOING TO EMPLOYMENT FAIRS. TO WORKING WITH LOCAL INSTITUTIONS TO HELP THEM THE JOB PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE HAVING THOSE DISCUSSIONS OFTENTIMES ESPECIALLY IN OUR CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. IT CAN SEEM VERY DRAMATIC IN TERMS OF VACANCIES BUT THERE MIGHT BE ONLY FOR POSITIONS THERE AND SOMEONE HAS LAUGHTER TO PEOPLE HAVE LEFT -- AND IF THEY'RE IN A HARD TO FILL AREA THAT COULD LOOK LIKE A 50% VACANCY FOR OCCUR TECHNICAL PROGRAMS THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULDN'T BE REACTING THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULD BE AGGRESSIVE IN. AND RECRUITING IT JUST MEANS THAT THOSE VIEWS ARE OUT THERE AND CAN IT CONTEXTUALIZED -- OUT OF PLACE SO WE ARE PUTTING A NUMBER OF PROCESSES IN PLACE AND HAVE HAD THEM IN PLACE FOR OVER A YEAR NOW TO REALLY TRY AND FOCUS ON THOSE AREAS WITH PROBLEMS AND MAKE SURE THEY WERE DOING HIRING. REVIEWING THINGS -- ON OUR C. B. T. SIDE TO MAKE SURE THAT -- HOURLY WAGES ARE APPROPRIATE ARE WORKING WITH OUR VENDORS WHO HAVE BEEN REALLY AMAZING IN TERMS OF BRAINSTORMING WITH US ON HOW THEY CAN BEST GET PEOPLE INTO -- INTO THIS YOU KNOW THE PROGRAMS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE LEADING THIS TREATMENT PROGRAMS LEADING THOSE ACADEMIC AREAS SO THE WORK CONTINUES BUT WE ABSOLUTELY -- HAVE EVERYTHING IN PLACE TO REALLY MONITOR IT NOW AND REALLY REACT TO THE SITUATION QUICKLY AND TRYING TO HELP I WHERE WE CAN. CUT IT NOW ARE THERE -- A LACK OF FOR FILLING VACANCIES IN THE C. B. E. T.'S. SIDE -- OR IS IT BECAUSE THOSE ARE CONTRACTED OUT THOSE ARE USUALLY FILLED WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT LIKE THE LOCATED EVERYTHING ELSE. THE VACANCIES RIGHT NOW OUR AROUND THEY RANGED IN REALLY AND AND 12214% -- WE STILL WANT TO DO BETTER ON THAT THE SAME WITH -- OUR ACADEMIC PROGRAMS OR ACADEMIC TEACHERS ARE ACTUALLY COVERING RIGHT AROUND I THINK COMING DOWN. ON THE WHERE WE'VE REALLY HAD I THINK SOME HISTORICAL STRUGGLES WITH C. B. T.. MASSIVELY OLLED OUT AND ADDITIONAL EXPANSIONS THERE SO WHEN YOU ADD HUNDREDS OF TREATMENT COUNSELORS INTO A SYSTEM THAT ONLY HAS SIX OR SEVEN HUNDRED YOU'RE EXPANDING YOUR WORKFORCE FOR THIRTY OR 40%. IT DOES TAKE SOME TIME TO GET THAT HIRING DONE -- AND I KNOW OUR PROVIDERS WILL BE ON THE THIRD PANEL TO TO POTENTIALLY DISCUSS SOME OF THE STRUGGLES IN TERMS OF HIRING BUT THEY'VE DONE AN AMAZING JOB A REALLY GOOD IT WAS PEOPLE IN THE SAME THING WITH OUR VOCATIONAL INSTRUCTORS. OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS WE'VE EXPANDED NEARLY 10% IN OUR CAREER TECHNICAL PROGRAMS AND SO THERE IS SOME GAPS THERE IN TERMS OF HIRING BUT THAT'S BECAUSE WE'VE EXPANDED SO MUCH AND WE CAN STILL CONTINUE TO DO THE HIRING WE HAVE -- SO THERE'S SOME GROWTH TO DO THERE BUT EVERYTHING IS IS RANGING IN A REASONABLE RATE BUT WE HAVE TARGETED INSTITUTIONS SECRETARY D. AS MENTIONED LOCATION SOMETIMES PLACES LIKE R. J. D. THEY CAN MAKE MORE MONEY IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR -- WORKING IN SAN DIEGO THAN WORKING IN OUR PRISON ENVIRONMENT AND SO THAT IT CAN BE DIFFICULT BUT JUST LIKE SECRETARY IDEA SAID WE ARE TASKED WITH GETTING IT DONE IT'S ABOUT SOLUTIONS -- AND SO WE ARE DOING CREATIVE -- YOU KNOW REALLY KIND OF TRYING TO FIND CREATIVE WAYS TO FIGURE OUT HIRING FOR THEM OR HELP THEM OUT ANYWAY THAT WE CAN SO THAT THOSE BODIES CAN GET IN THERE AND START TEACHING. NINE AS A STAFFING GOALS MENTIONED AS ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE AUDITOR'S REPORT SO. IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAN IN SIX MONTHS YOU HAVE A PLAN TO HELP FULFILL OR AT LEAST ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE NEED TO THEN AS WE GO BACK INTO SUBCOMMITTEE IN BUDGET THOSE ARE. ISSUES THAT WE CAN DISCUSS. YES ABSOLUTELY YES. I KNOW MISTER JONES SAWYER HAS A COUPLE QUESTIONS PLEASE AND THEN -- MISTER DE AS I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW -- THEIR THEIR COUPLE OF US -- BUT TRY TO MEET EVERY WEDNESDAY FOR BIBLE STUDY. AND WE DO BELIEVE IN RELIGIOUS PROGRAMS AND WE DO BELIEVE THAT THIS SPACE AND WE DO BELIEVE. THERE'S A RETURN ON INVESTMENT SO -- WHICH IS I KNOW YOU. YOU IT STATED THAT YOU WEREN'T SURE YOU COULD GET EVIDENCE BASED OUT OF THAT BUT TO SO AS I BELIEVE IN THE POWER OF PRAYER. EVIDENCE OF THOSE SAME BIBLE STUDIES AND IF THAT'S AN INVITE ALL ATTEND. SO I THINK PART OF MY AFTER LISTENING TO MR SO SO SO I THINK I CLEARLY UNDERSTANDING PART OF MY FRUSTRATION -- AS YOU WERE. KIND OF GOING OVER AND OVER THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHERE I CALL WIDGETS GOING IN. THE NUMBER PEOPLE THERE PROP FIFTY SEVEN A NUMBER PEOPLE THEY'RE GETTING CREDITS YOU NAME IT ALL THESE HOURS TO GET REDUCE TIME -- THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THIS TRAINING GROUP -- AND THEY GET TIME OFF. EIGHT YOU NEED TO REALIZE. FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT COULD BE A PROBLEM THAT YOU'RE NOT MEASURING HOW SUCCESSFUL THESE PROGRAMS ARE. AND YOU JUST LETTING PEOPLE OUT AND FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT COULD BE VERY VERY PROBLEMATIC AND OUT OF I MEAN IT THE BEST PROBABLY EXAMPLE I CAN. I CAN GIVE YOU IS THERE'S A THERE'S A COMPANY. THAT BASICALLY -- DOING VERY WELL [inaudible] AND BUILDING PLANES AND I COME TO YOU BOEING TWO PLANES GO DOWN. THE WHOLE COMPANY ALMOST WENT DOWN AND WE'RE STILL NOT SURE IF OVER HIM OUT YOU KNOW. BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE IF JUST ONE OR TWO INMATES. THAT WE RELEASE WITHOUT GOING TO A PROGRAM THAT. THAT WE'RE PRETTY SURE IS WORKING. IT COULD HAVE DRAMATIC THE DEVASTATION OF IMPACT ON WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. AND SO. IT'S NICE TO KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE HELPING A LOT OF PEOPLE. BUT IT DOES JUST ANOTHER PARADIGM SHIFT IS ANOTHER GEAR YOU'VE GOT TO GET INTO. WHERE YOU'RE ACTUALLY MEASURING HOW SUCCESSFUL THESE PROGRAMS ARE? ON THE BACK WHEN THE BACK IN AS THEY LEAVE. BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW DAY LEAVING. AND I AS I WAS TRYING TO TELL YOU PART OF FRUSTRATING THING ABOUT GETTING INFORMATION FROM YOU DEPARTMENT. I GOT ALL THESE WIDGETS IN AND OUT GIVE ME TO PULL WHAT LITTLE HAIR I HAD OUT BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT I ASKED. FOR AND IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE THE DEPARTMENT IS JUST SO NARROWLY FOCUSED. ON HOW MANY. HOW MANY HAND YOU CAN TOUCH HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU CAN GET INTO PROGRAMS? THAT EITHER YOU NEED ADDITIONAL -- YOUR TO FOCUS SOME OF YOUR RESOURCE ARE HAVE INTO DOING. SOME MEASUREMENTS SO THAT YOU CAN GET THE THE PROVEN ANALYTICS TO SHOW THAT THE THE PROGRAMS ARE WORKING [inaudible] OR OUT OF YOU BE HONEST WITH ME NOW BUT I GET THIS YEAR. I'M INTERESTED TO THE OBVIOUS. I HAVE NO. NO REAL PROOF BY I GET ALMOST A SPEAR THAT. THAT PARTY APARTMENT DON'T WANT TO SHOW WHERE THINGS MAY NOT BE WORKING. BECAUSE YOU MAY HAVE. TO REASSIGN. OR RE ASIDE SOME PEOPLE OUT OF DEPARTMENT BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T FIT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS ABOUT. THIS RETICENCE TO SHOW HOW. SUCCESSFUL THESE PROGRAMS ARE. AND THE MORE MORE I ASKED FOR IT THE MORE MORE I GET NO DISRESPECT MISSUS SOSA THE MORE MORE I GET THIS WIDGET IN THING. IT DRIVES ME NUTS BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT I RECENTLY ASKED FOR THE AUDIT. THAT'S NOT WHAT I ASKED FOR WHEN I MET WITH YOU. AND I'M STILL NOT GETTING. IT AND IT IS JUST. I JUST NEED TO KNOW WHAT WHAT. IS IT I MEAN WHAT WHAT IS WHAT DO YOU IS IT. IS A RE DIRECTING EXISTING FUNDS SO CHU YOUR YOU DO THAT YOU NEED LEGISLATION TO DO THAT WHAT DO YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO GET THIS DONE BECAUSE THIS SEEMS TO ME COULD BE. FAIRLY SIMPLE. SIX GET THIS. DONE. I THINK I THINK TO BEGIN TO RESPOND -- I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD AND I THINK THE CONVERSATIONS FOR ME THE TAKE AWAY I HAD. AS A WE WERE SPEAKING THE SAME THING BUT JUST SAYING IT DIFFERENTLY. AND MAYBE THAT'S THAT THAT I'LL CALL OWN THAT AND THAT WE WE ARE JUST SO INGRAINED THAT THIS IS THE YOU KNOW THE MEASURE IT IN THE FORMAL RESPONSE. BUT WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS LIKE I SAID HOW DO YOU MEASURE THE SUCCESS -- AND ONE OF THE ANALYTICS ON A PARTICULAR PROGRAM TO SHOW THAT THEY DIDN'T COME BACK TO PRISON IN THIS SAVINGS FROM THAT AND THROUGH THAT SAME IS NOW WE CAN RELOCATE THESE FUNDS OVER HERE. CORRECT BUT ALSO IF THEY'RE WORKING. THE NOT RAPING PILLAGING SO ROBBING BASED BASICALLY ON OFFENSE IS EITHER. SO BASED ON OUR CONVERSATION I DID MEET. AND WE'D I DID HAVE THAT FRANK DISCUSSION THAT WE TO DO WE TEND TO GET VERY BUREAUCRATIC. AND OTHER ONE USED TO BE WERE BUT YOU'RE RIGHT WE TEND TO GET VERY BUREAUCRATIC AND I THINK IT'S MAYBE JUST OUT OF OUT OF FEAR CONCERN THAT WE'RE GONNA SAY THE WRONG THINGS. AND AND THAT'S THAT THAT'S JUST. MY STANCE SOLD MET WITH THE TEAM WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH A BETTER WAY TO EXPLAIN. WHY WERE SUCCESSFUL AND IF WE'RE SUCCESSFUL THE SAVINGS OF THE COST BENEFIT FROM THAT? WHERE WE GONNA SAY WE COULD USE IN OTHER PLACES TO ASK CAN WE USE A SOMEWHERE ELSE BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL HERE? AND THE FEAR MAYBE WHILE THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE THE FUNDS THAT'S NOT OUR FAIR ANYMORE. I FOR IS THAT WE HAVE TO SHOW WERE SUCCESSFUL IS NOT ABOUT THE FUNDS BUT THE PERSON. THE IMPACT THE LESS VICTIM. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING. FOR SO FOR ME IT'S READING. I'LL RE READ NHà REORGANIZING OUR THOUGHT PROCESS ON HOW TO RESPOND TO THESE THINGS NOW THEY'RE GONNA BE TIMES WHEN WE WILL GET THE BUREAUCRATIC RESPONSE BECAUSE THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT'S REQUIRED AT THE TIME BUT I I TAKE OUR CONVERSATION. THE THE WILL HAVE TO RE CRAFT -- RESPOND TO THAT AND WE CAN'T BE AFRAID TO SAY THIS JUST IN WORK. AND IT'S NOT WORKING WE CAN BE AFRAID BECAUSE AT LEAST WE TRIED. AND WHAT I CAN AS SHE GAVE ME A LITTLE GLIMPSE AND SO I I PROBABLY NEED TO BE SITTING WHERE YOU'RE SITTING AND LOOKING BACK AND REMEMBER WHAT THAT. WAS LIKE ESPECIALLY DURING HARD ECONOMIC TIMES BECAUSE YOU DID REAL WELL. AND YOU SAVE. MONEY ANY DEPARTMENT. THAT THE STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES TO SAY YOU NEED LESS MONEY IN YOUR BUDGET NEXT YEAR INSTEAD OF RE TOOLING THAT MONEY BACK YOU DEPARTMENTS YOU COULD SAY MORE TO COULD DO MORE AND BE MORE EFFICIENT. AND THAT JUST DADS. THAT'S BEEN A TIME HONORED. THING THAT'S BEEN DONE SO AT LEAST FROM OF AB SET YOUR POSITION BEING AHEAD OF A DIVISION THAT WORRIED THAT -- PEOPLE WOULD CUT. BODIES IN AND RESOURCES OUT OF MY DIVISION AND SO. I I DID DID TO BE A CREDIT TO STEPS SO THAT HI HI I COULD KEEP PEOPLE ALSO. AT LEAST THAT HELP THAT HELPS -- MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE COULD LEGISLATE WITH THE BUDGET AS BEST WE CAN SAVE YOU. IF YOU DO HAVE SAVINGS THAT SOME OF IT NEEDS TO GO BACK INTO CONTINUING DOING THAT'S WHY I'M TRYING YOU TO RETURN THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT. BECAUSE IN BUSINESS THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THAT IF YOU PA MORE MONEY. INTO A SUCCESSFUL. CAR LINE THEN YOU'LL MAKE MORE MONEY AND YOU'LL BE MORE SUCCESSFUL YOU CAN YOU CAN -- HIRE MORE PEOPLE. THAT IS NOT THE GOVERNMENT AWAY YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT SO THAT AT LEAST NOW YOU'VE GIVEN ME -- A GLIMPSE OF WHAT WHAT YOU'RE SEEING A MAYBE EVEN THE FEAR. A WHAT'S GOING ON AND MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO TO WORK ON THAT WE'RE NOT GOING. TO IF YOU HAVE SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS WERE NOT GOING TO DECIMATED APARTMENT. BECAUSE YOU DID THE RIGHT THING. AND THE AND THE IT'S THE SAME VOTE TO SWITCH SPACE -- WE'VE ELIMINATED. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUT OF CDC ARE. AND WE'RE BEING TOLD. WE STILL NEED ALL THIS SPACE -- IN MY MIND WHEN I USED TO DO REAL STATED -- BUT THE MISSED MORE LIKE AND I'VE HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THAT -- YOU WOULD CONSOLIDATE RIGHT AND IF YOU DIDN'T NEED A BUILDING YOU COULD ACCESS ALL OUR OPERATIONS YOU WOULD DO THAT -- AND THAT THAT'S SCARY BECAUSE THEN YOU LOSE A BUILDING IN. AND YOU LOSE EVEN MORE PEOPLE AND SO. THERE I BELIEVE THERE'S ENOUGH SPACE. THERE WE JUST HAVE. TO HAVE PEOPLE THAT KNOW HOW. TO RECONFIGURE. SPACE ALLOCATIONS AND YOU HIGHER IS GIVE GROUPS THAT DO THAT ALL THE TIME. THEY DID IT WHEN I WAS THE CITY OF LA HE PROBABLY DID IT WHEN MISTER MOORE LOCK WHICH AT THE COUNTY SO YOU CAN LOOK AT YOUR SPACE ALLOCATION AND MAKE. SOME -- TO ME DECISIONS ARE SMART DECISIONS SO YOU CAN DO THAT SO THAT'S MY SECOND. FRUSTRATION OF HOW CAN WE WOULD GET YOU SIGNATURE CLASSROOM SEEING. ULTIMATELY GET PEOPLE DOING THAT I KNOW THE PROJECT WAS CHOMPING TO SAY SOMETHING YEAH I WANT TO SAY THAT I COMPLETELY CONCUR WITH YOU UNDERSTAND -- NOW ESPECIALLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF THAT YOU KNOW WE ARE WHAT WE PUT THESE MINUTE ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS IN BECAUSE WE WANTED TO KNOW AT THE END OF THE DAY WE ARE STILL. IMPLEMENTING THE BEST PROGRAMS WE COULD BUT I ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND -- SAYING THE ONE FEAR THAT WE'VE HAD INTERNALLY IS WHEN YOU DO A RESEARCH ANALYSIS ON SOMEBODY THAT HAD SAY TWENTY YEARS INCARCERATED AND THEY'VE TAKEN THIRTY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. THAT THAT RECIDIVISM ANALYSIS ARE WE GOING TO PINPOINT THAT ONE PROGRAM IS A THAT WAS IT OR PINPOINT ACADEMIC AND SAY THAT WAS IT THAT'S WHY WE WANTED TO CALL IN A RESEARCHER TO SAY. A REAL REGRESSION ANALYSIS HAS TO BE DONE HERE TO PICK OUT THE RIGHT PIECES SO THAT WE'RE NOT GIVING YOUR RECIDIVISM FACT ABOUT SOMEBODY. THAT WAS ACTUALLY TIED TO SOMETHING ELSE THAT DONE SO THAT'S PART OF THE RESEARCH PROJECTS THAT WE WANT. TO BE CONTRACTED IN AND HAVE THEM LOOK AT IS JUST OUR FEAR IN MAKING THE WRONG IS -- ASSESSMENT BY LOOKING AT RECIDIVISM TIED TO MAYBE ONE THING WHEN THEY'VE DONE TWENTY TWO DIFFERENT THINGS OVER THE COURSE OF DECADES WHETHER INCARCERATED SO I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE'RE COMING FROM A LITTLE BIT IN TERMS OF HESITANCY. BUT WE ARE ABSOLUTELY BRAINSTORMING EVERY DAY BECAUSE I RECOGNIZE WHAT YOU WANT I THINK THERE'S A WAY TO GET THERE -- WE HAVE THE RECIDIVISM DATA WE HAVE THE DOJ DATA IT'S JUST ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE NOT. RESPONSIBLE ONE TAGGING IT TO ONE CERTAIN FACTOR CORRECTION I THINK WE WOULD BE COGNIZANT OF THAT AND ACTUALLY LOOK FOR THE TRENDS. RIGHT BECAUSE USUALLY MOST INMATES ARE INVOLVED IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND NOT JUST ONE BUT I THINK FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WE'RE JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ONES ARE TRULY ARE WORKING I HAVE THE BETTER TRENDS BECAUSE YOU'LL BE ABLE. TO TO TEASE THAT DATE. THAT DATA OUT. SO THE MIST MORE OR MISTER MOORE LIKE HAD A QUESTION CENTER TOMORROW THANK YOU FOR JOINING US SURE. THANK YOU. MISTER VICE CHAIR FOR MENTIONING MY NAME THREE TIMES A YEAR WITH. THREE FIVE BUT I'D LIKE TO CLOSE IN PRAYER [inaudible] NOT. THIS IS PROBABLY MY BUSIEST YEAR UP HERE -- BECAUSE THIS YEAR I'VE BEEN MOVED FROM BUDGET AND FISCAL REVIEW SUB ONE EDUCATION TO SUB FIVE CORRECTIONS PUBLIC SAFETY AND JUDICIARY SO. THERE'S THIS LEARNING CURVE IS YOU KNOW JUST. UNBELIEVABLE AND I APOLOGIZE I'VE HAD.

YOU KNOW YOU ACCEPTED THIS INDIVIDUAL AND WE HAVE MORE LET YOU KNOW THAT. THEY HAVE THE FOLLOWING BACKGROUND AND AND I'M SAYING WELL I WAS THE TREASURER THE COUNTY AND I FUNCTION WITH MONEY. AND I'VE GOT TO BE REAL CAREFUL. INSIDE TWO OF THESE INSTANCES IN SO [inaudible] I DECIDED. ON THESE -- TWO WITH MIKE SENIOR MANAGEMENT SELECT HIRAM LET'S STAY WITH THEM LET'S HELP -- DESERT THEY WANT IT DIRECTOR GETTING BACK IN THE SYSTEM THEY'RE YOUNG AND THEY YOU KNOW IT'S TIME FOR GRACE. SORRY I I'M HERE TO SAY THAT. ONE OF THEM DID WELL AND MIKE. YOU KNOW STAFF SAYS MIKE'S USE IN THE COUNTY. VAN WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING IT WITH IT AT THE LUNCH HOUR PRETTY.

I SAY THAT IT ONLY BE TRIVIAL BUT I HAVE A 50% RECIDIVISM RATE. YOU KNOW JUST ON TRYING IT BUT YOU CAN'T REALLY SCARED. BECAUSE WHEN THE THIRD PERSON SHOWED UP. THEY INFORMED ME THAT. SHE HAD A A RECORD IT WAS LIKE I DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN THAT ROAD RUNNING AND I DON'T WANT. TO BUY A FIFTY FIFTY SHOT. SO I I SIDE BUT I'M I'M. I'M SAYING YOUR NUMBERS MAYBE FOR PRETTY ACCURATE BASED ON MY LIFE EXPERIENCE [inaudible] BUT I'M. I CAN I WANT TO ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS OF MISTER SUSE IF I COULD NOT ONE IN YOUR MARRIAGE EVEN MATT MAY HAVE BEEN ASKED BUT I JUST WANT TO KNOW. WHAT IT WHAT IS YOUR EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND -- I HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE FROM CSU STANISLAUS AND A LAW DEGREE FROM FORESTRY ONE SCHOOL OF LAW AND STOCKTON [inaudible] AND THEN. WHAT IS WHAT IS YOUR CAREER PATH BEEN WHAT WHAT YOUR HISTORY -- I ORIGINALLY STARTED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS IN THE BUDGET MANAGEMENT BRANCH OVERSEEING FISCAL OPERATIONS FOR THE DIVISION HEALTH CARE SERVICES -- WHEN DOES SPLIT HAD REALLY OCCURRED THEN I WENT TO WORK AT VALLEY STATE PRISON FOR WOMEN AT THE TIME -- AS A CONTRACT ANALYSTS THE BUDGET ANALYST I DID SOME ACTING ROLES AT THE A LOCAL INSTITUTION THERE AND THEN CAME BACK UP TO HEADQUARTERS AND WORKED IN THE BUDGET MANAGER BRANCH OVERSEEING -- A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS IN THERE INCLUDING I HEALTH CARE AGAIN I TECHNICAL OPERATIONS AND OVERSEEING THE BUDGET FIELD OPERATIONS -- THROUGH THE MANAGER ROLES AND CHIEF -- AND THE BUDGET FIELD OPERATIONS INCLUDED THE DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS ALL INSTITUTIONAL BUDGETS -- THAT DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE CONTACT BEDS IN IT REALLY GAVE ME SOME GREAT INSIGHT INTO POLICY EXPERIENCE AND I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND WITH THIS COMMITTEES COMING FROM BECAUSE IT HAS TO MAKE. DOLLARS AND SENSE TO ME AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE TRIED TO IMPLEMENT EVERYTHING WE CAN AS SOON AS I WENT DOWN INTO DRP FOLLOWING MY BUDGET STAND. IT IS REALLY TO ME AT HAS TO MATHEMATICALLY WORK OUT AS WELL AND SO I COME FROM THAT BACKGROUND IN TERMS OF POLICY BUDGETS AND BUDGETING -- IN MAKING SURE THAT IT'S IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO BE DOING FOR THE TAX DOLLARS THAT WE'RE SPENDING ON THESE PROGRAMS AND SO I COME FROM THAT BACKGROUND A LITTLE BIT AND C. C. R.. SO WHY WOULD A LAW SCHOOL GRADUATE. BE A BUDGET DIRECTOR WIRED TO A CPA WHY DID YOU GO DOWN THE RIGHT COURSE. AND I'M GETTING NERVOUS. TALKING ABOUT. IS ONE OF MY KEEP LATER. ACTUALLY OCCURRED WHILE I WAS IN THE BUDGET MANAGEMENT BRANCH I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL AT NIGHT. I'M IN DOING THAT THIS INTO YOUR P. TRULY THAT IS NOT A REQUIREMENT FOR ME IT'S A PASSION BECAUSE OF THE THINGS THAT WERE IMPLEMENTING -- IT'S A PASSION BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT I SEE THE PRESENT CULTURE CHANGING WITH THE PROGRAMS THAT WE ARE PROVIDING JUST IN MY TIME IN C. C. R. IT'S A PASSION FOR ME TO MAKE THE DOLLARS AND CENTS WORK. I'M PROUD TO BE IN THE DIVISION -- AND LEADING A TEAM OF PEOPLE THAT CAN PUT CDC ON THE BLACK AND SO FOR ME THIS CREATES -- SOMETHING IN TERMS OF SUSTAINABILITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT BUT I THINK WE'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE AND WE HAVE HEARINGS LIKE THIS AND AUDITS LIKE THIS BECAUSE THE DATA COLLECTION AND AND NORMALLY THE DEPARTMENTS CAN OFTEN GO. IN COLLECTED A LOT OF THIS IS A RESULT OF US GOING NO WE'RE GONNA COLLECTED BECAUSE WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS. SO I'M HERE TRULY -- BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THE DEPARTMENT AND THE CHANGES THAT WERE MADE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE ARE APPRECIATE YOUR PASSION I THINK YOUR BOSS IS LUCKY TO HAVE YOU. YES I AM. I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU. MR SOUSA -- YOU YOU YOU YOU GAVE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT CONCURRENT SINCE SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT REMEDIES -- WOW HOW DO YOU ASSURE US OF ACCOUNTABILITY THAT YOU'RE GONNA FALL THROUGH THAT. THAT YOU'RE GOING TO MEET THE BENCHMARKS AND THAT -- YOU'RE GONNA MAKE A MISTER DE IS REALLY PROUD. YOU KNOW SOME OF THE STUFF IS REALLY MAKING DATA DRIVEN DECISIONS AND PLANNING AND SO WHAT WE'VE DONE OVER THE LAST YEAR IS TRYING TO FOLLOW UP ON THOSE WEEKLY MONTHLY QUARTERLY. REPORTS WE HAVE DETAILED -- DATA DASHBOARDS THAT COME OUT NOW EVERY SINGLE MONTH AND GO TO EVERY PRINCIPLE EVERY WARDEN EVERY ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR THAT'S OVER THE DIVISION OF A DAHLE INSTITUTIONS. SO THAT IF SOMEBODY'S NOT COMPLETING WE KNOW DOWN TO THAT PERSON WHY THEY'RE NOT COMPLETING A PROGRAM -- WE HAVE WORK GROUPS THAT HAVE DEVELOPED UNDER MISTER IDEAS IS DIRECTION ABOUT TRANSFERRING INMATES WE RECOGNIZE THAT TO BE A PROBLEM IN TERMS OF COMPLETIONS SO WE'RE TRYING TO SEE AN BACK INTO THE REASONS. OF WHY THAT TRANSFER HAS SO WE CAN START MITIGATING THESE THINGS CORRECTIONS LIVES IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT THEY ARE VERY REAL PROBLEMS AND VERY COMPLEX PROBLEMS BUT THERE ARE SOLUTIONS TOMB IF WE KNOW WHAT THOSE PROBLEMS ARE. AND OFTENTIMES WITHOUT DATA YOU GO IN BLIND AND YOU MAKE DECISIONS THAT ACTUALLY AREN'T REAL ON THAT AREN'T BASED ON A REAL ACCOUNTABILITY SO IN TERMS OF POWER HOW MY GONNA DISPLAY IT. I'M GOING TO DO IT EXACTLY HOW WE'VE BEEN DOING IT WHICH IS DEVELOPER PORTS PUBLICLY TALK ABOUT IT AND TALK ABOUT THE THINGS THEY WERE DOING. I THINK -- IN TERMS OF COLLABORATION EVEN WITH THAT THE STATE AUDITOR THEY KNOW THAT I AND AS TRANSPARENT I THINK IT'S CAN BE. CALIFORNIA REHABILITATION OVERSIGHT BOARD I'M HAPPY TO GIVE THEM ANY INFORMATION WE'VE BEEN DEVELOPING HOW WE WANT THOSE BOARD MEETINGS TO LOOK BECAUSE THE MORE THAT WE DISPLAY AT THE MORE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT. THE MORE THE CALIFORNIA RECOGNIZES REHABILITATION IS HERE TO STAY THE HIGHER IMPACTS THAT WILL HAVE IN THE INSTITUTIONAL -- AND AND SEE THE STARS THE WHOLE SO IT'S REALLY FOR ME ABOUT COLLECTING DATA AND MAKING SURE THAT ITS OPERATION AVAILABLE AND HAVING ALL OF MY STAFF -- AND EVERYONE IN THE DEPARTMENT BE SOLUTION BASED IT'S NOT ABOUT A PROBLEM WE CAN OVERCOME IT'S ABOUT HOW DO WE MEDICAID THAT PROBLEM SO THE PEOPLE ARE GETTING REHABILITATION. STUFF THE STUFF WORKS YOU KNOW IT WORKS NATIONALLY -- IT WORKS OF IMPLEMENTED CORRECTLY IT WORKS IF THEY HAVE THE COMMUNITY RESOURCES THAT THEY'RE TIED TO WE SEE IT WORKING WE'VE PULLED TO HIGH LEVEL DATA POINTS JUST THIS YEAR. IN TERMS OF ACADEMIC EDUCATION I MENTIONED IN ONE HEARING WE SEE THAT I CONVICTIONS IN IN ONE YEAR OF RELEASE IT'S NOT A LOT OF DATA YET BECAUSE LONGITUDINALLY WE DON'T HAVE A LOT. BUT WE SEE CONVICTIONS -- THAT ARE NORMALLY AT NINE EIGHTEEN POINT 5% ARE DOWN TO NINE POINT YOUR HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA PRESS RELEASE THOSE ARE HUGE NUMBERS THAT WE SAY. THESE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL IMPACTS SO -- THAT'S THE YOU KNOW OUR M. C. R. PEAS OUR MEAL COMMUNITY REENTRY PROGRAMS WHICH THE I THINK WILL BE DISCUSSED TODAY OF IT. WE SEE RECIDIVISM IMPACTS SOMETIMES OFFER PEOPLE STAYING LONGER THAN SIX MONTHS OUT THOSE PROGRAMMES UPWARDS OF 30% THERE ARE. OUR TIME WE'RE SHOWING YOU WERE A LITTLE MORE PASSIONATE. SORRY AND TIME I NEED A TIMER -- SO THERE'S THINGS ABOUT PUBLICLY DISPLAYING DATA AND AND REALLY I I SEE THOSE TO COULD YOU IN FIFTY WORDS OR LESS. JUST GIVE ME AN ASSESSMENT OF YOUR REACTION TO THIS AUDIT WAS IT A FAIR AUDIT WAS IT ACCURATE. WERE THERE SOME AREAS THAT CAN BE BROUGH. I THINK THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE DIFFERENCES AND HOW. DATA IS REPRESENTED BUT I AGREE AND CONCUR WITH THE THE AUDIT FINDINGS THE THE DISAPPOINTING PART FOR ME IS -- WE HAVE LED THE DIVISION IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS TO REALLY TRY AND PUT THE THINGS AND FOUNDATIONAL ANY SO THAT WE KNOW WHEN WE'RE GIVING YOU RESEARCH FIGURES ARE WE ARE CONTRACTING WITH RESEARCHERS. FIFTY FIVE FIFTY SIX AREA THAT THAT DATA SALAS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. FOR THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT YOUR DS FOR LET ME PICK ON YOUR LITTLE THEIR CAN I HAVE A LITTLE FUN RIGHT -- NO THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT OF THE COMMENTS ABOUT BEING DATA DRIVEN BUT I DID WANT TO ASK JUST SO THAT YOU CAN RESPOND BECAUSE EARLIER WAS TALKED ABOUT HOW. VENDORS INTENDED THE INSTITUTIONS TO NOT USE EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS FOR THE CURRICULA. RIGHT AND YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF DATE AS OF YOU CAN JUST KINDA. TALK ABOUT THAT A Y. EIGHT THOSE INSTITUTIONS ARE DOING THAT OR WHAT'S THE HOLD UP FOR THAT TO ACTUALLY HAPPEN -- I'D APPRECIATE THAT. SO -- IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE SORT OF WORK WITH YOU WHICH REALLY OPENED THE DOOR UP. TO BEING IN THE QUEUE RESULTS FIRST CLEARING HOUSE AS EVIDENCE BASED ON RESEARCH AND SO WE COLLECTED ALL OF THIS CURRICULUM INFORMATION FROM OUR PROVIDERS -- AND ASSESS WHETHER IT WAS IN THE CLEARING HOUSE AND THAT IS KIND OF THE ROLE THAT WE'VE BEEN TAKING AT THIS POINT THAT IT BE. IN THE RESULTS FIRST CLEARING HOUSE OF THE INTERVENTION OUR CURRICULUM LEVEL. FOLLOWING THAT ASSESSMENT AND WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN THE AUDIT IS WE BEGAN WE PUT IN A CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WE SAID YOU HAVE TO START TELLING US ALL THE CURRICULUM THAT'S HAPPENING. DOWN TO THE PERSON TAKING A CERTAIN ASPECT OF A CURRICULUM AND WHAT TABLE OF CONTENTS THAT'S RELATED TO HIM SO VERY DETAILED INFORMATION BECAUSE WE KNOW IT'S GONNA BE USEFUL FOR RESEARCH. AND SO THERE'S BEEN THIS CATEGORIZATION OF EVERYTHING HAS TO BE IN THE RESULTS FIRST CLEARING HOUSE. AT THE INTERVENTION A CURRICULUM LEVEL AND WE HAVE PROVIDERS IN OUR CONTRACTS TO SAY THAT IT MUST BE EVIDENCE BASED WHEN WE DID A REVIEW OF SANSA. THEY SAID JUST BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN THIS CLEARING HOUSE DOES NOT MEAN IT'S EVIDENCE BASE JUST MEANS NOT RESEARCHED AND PUT IN THIS CLEARING HOUSE. SO WE WERE TRYING TO BE -- COGNIZANT OF NOT APPROACHING THAT TOO AGGRESSIVELY TO SAY BECAUSE NOT EVERYTHING'S IN THE CLEARING HOUSE OUR PROVIDERS SOME OF THE 20% THAT'S REFERENCED IN HERE. HAVE DECADES OF CURRICULUM THAT THEY'VE BEEN USING IN PRISON THAT HAS HAD RESEARCH STUDIES BEHIND IT THAT SHOW THAT IT -- RESULTS AND EFFECTIVE RECIDIVISM SO WE TRIED NOT TO BE SOMEWHAT BY THE DISCONNECT IN THE AUDITOR'S ACTUALLY SAYING IT'S NOT EVIDENCE BASED THE AUDITOR'S REVIEWED THE RESULTS FIRST CLEARING HOUSE NOT THAT'S THE STANDARD THAT WE'VE PUT FORWARD AT THIS POINT SO. THEY'RE REVIEWING IT AS IS IT INCLUDED IN THERE AND OUT THAT THEY CAN CORRECT ME IS INCLUDED IN THE RESULTS FIRST CLEARING HOUSE -- AND THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE REVIEWING THE CURRICULUM AGAINST [inaudible] GOT IT [inaudible] RIGHT -- WHAT A ONE LAST QUESTION BECAUSE MISTER DE AS YET CHAIRED A STORY EARLIER -- BUT THE INDIVIDUAL THAT WORKED AT THE RAM STADIUM NOW. AND I WAS JUST WONDERING. WHAT CDC ARE DOING FOR THOSE FOLKS WE HAVE THESE PROGRAMS IN CORRECTIONS? YOU SHARED A SUCCESS STORY OF SOMEONE THAT ONE OUT BUT HOW ARE WE CONNECTING THOSE SO THAT STORY IS MULTIPLIED YOU KNOW A HUNDRED FOLD -- DOES CDC OUR WORK WITH INDUSTRIES YOU KNOW I'LL DECIDE THE SYSTEM SO THAT PARTNER THOSE AND REALLY BUILD BRIDGES RIGHT. CDC ARE ALONG WITH PIAA BOTH ASIAN OR BOTH AGENCIES WE DO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE WORKFORCE INVESTMENT BOARD EDT LABOR. AND WE HAVE BEEN -- BUILDING BUILDING COMMUNICATIONS AND PATHWAYS -- TO SO THE INMATE CAN UTILIZE A CERTIFICATE BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE GETTING IN WITH THE UNION HALLS RIGHT NOW THROUGH PIAA AND WITH THE CDC ALSO WE ARE. INDIVIDUALS ARE ABLE TO TAKE EXAMINATIONS IN PRISON WE GET THEM CONNECTED WITH UNION ALSO UPON RELEASE THAT -- PRIOR TO THEM EVEN LEAVING P. I. A S. PAYING UNION WAIT. UNION DUES PART OF THEM BEING RELEASED SO WHEN THEY DO GET OUT. THEY'RE ABLE TO GO TO THE UNION HALL AND UTILIZE A CERTIFICATE. SO IT'S JUST THROUGH OUR PRISON EMPLOYMENT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD AND WORKING WITH THEM -- YOU KNOW JUST WORKING WITH OUR NEWLY ESTABLISHED PRISON EMPLOYMENT. OKAY THANK YOU WHEN WE ASK ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS HEARING NONE THANK YOU WILL LOOK FORWARD TO THE SIX MONTH REPORT -- WITH A LOT OF THESE HOPEFULLY THAT WILL SEE MORE -- PROGRESS ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT WITH THAT LET'S GO TO MOVE TO OUR NEXT PANEL IT'S ITEM NUMBER FOUR COMMENTS ON REHABILITATION AND REENTRY PROGRAMS WE HAVE SEASON CHAMPION. DEPUTY DIRECTOR WITH STANFORD LAW SCHOOL THREE STRIKES PROJECT DOUG BONTA CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER WITH. AMITY FOUNDATION JOHN JENKINS SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT WITH LESS CARE FOUNDATION THANK YOU GUYS FOR JOINING US AND HEARINGS GOING A LITTLE BIT LONGER THANK YOU. FOR FOR BEING WITH US THIS ENTIRE TIME. SO FIVE YOU CARE TO BEGIN. WE'LL GO AN AGENDA OR PERFECT THANK YOU AND THANK YOU SUSAN CHAMPION WITH THE THREE STRIKES PROJECT AT STANFORD LAW SCHOOL -- HI I'M HERE PRIMARILY TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE OF AN INMATE WHO IS RETURNING TO HIS OR HER COMMUNITY AFTER SERVING. A PRISON SENTENCE -- HAVE THE THREE STRIKES PROJECT WE INITIATED THE THREE STRIKES REFORM ACT WHICH MEANT THAT AT A CERTAIN POINT IN TIME. BETWEEN THREE AND FOUR THOUSAND LIFE INMATES WERE RETURNING TO THEIR COMMUNITIES AFTER HAVING BEEN FACING A LIFE SENTENCE. MANY OF THEM HAD BEEN IN PRISON FOR TEN TO SEVENTEEN TWENTY YEARS AT THIS POINT -- AND WE KNEW THAT THE SUCCESS OF THIS REFORM THE SUCCESS OF SENTENCING REFORM. CHANGED IN LARGE PART ON THE SUCCESS OF THE INDIVIDUALS OR GETTING OUT. AND BECAUSE WE ARE BECAUSE WE WORK WITH MULTIPLE COUNTIES -- WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH RE ENTRY HAS BEEN DONE -- OUR BIGGEST CONCERN FOR OUR CLIENT'S WAS THAT THEY HAVE A BAD AND FOOD. AND BASIC NECESSITIES IN A SAFE AND SOBRE ENVIRONMENT. THAT WAS WHAT WE THAT WAS WHAT WE FELT WAS AT THE BARE MINIMUM WHAT THEY NEEDED. AND IN MOST CASES THAT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND WE SCOURED THE STATE GOING FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY TRYING TO FIND PROGRAMS WE HAD STANFORD LAW SCHOOL INTERNS. GOING THROUGH BOOKS TRYING TO FIND PLACES WHERE WE CAN SAFELY HOUSE OUR CLIENTS IT WAS VERY VERY DIFFICULT. WE EVENTUALLY FOUND A COUPLE OF PROGRAMS THAT WE REALLY BELIEVED IN THAT WE KNEW WERE GOING TO BE HELPFUL. EVEN THEN THERE WERE HUGE BARRIERS TO GETTING OUR CLIENTS IN THERE IF THEY WERE COMING FROM THE COUNTY IN WHICH A PROGRAM DIDN'T. THE PROGRAM DIDN'T EXIST WE WOULD HAVE TROUBLE EITHER GETTING THEIR PROBATION TRANSFERRED TO THE WE WOULD SAY LOOK WE HAVE A BED FOR THIS PERSON IN A PROGRAM THEY'RE GONNA FEED THIS PERSON THEY'RE GONNA HELP THIS PERSON GET THE SERVICES THEY NEED. AND GIVE THIS PERSON CBT PROGRAMMING AND HELP THEM RETURN TO THE COMMUNITIES AND WE'LL BE TOLD NO WE'RE NOT GONNA ALLOW THIS PERSON'S -- PROBATION TO BE TRANSFERRED OR WE'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW THIS PERSON'S PAROLE TO BE TRANSFERRED BECAUSE THAT'S JUST NOT THE WAY WE DO THINGS. THIS MEANS THAT A CLIENT COMES OUT OF PRISON WITH TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS. GOES TO A BUS STOP. AND TAKES THAT BUS WHEREVER THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO GO AND INSTRUCTIONS TO REPORT TO A PAROLE OFFICE -- INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE COMING OUT OF PRISON HAVE A THIRD THIRTEEN X. GREATER CHANCE OF DYING WITHIN THE FIRST TWO WEEKS OF RELEASE. THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF DEATH IS OVERDOSE THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IS A HEART ATTACK WHICH IS GENERALLY RELATED TO OVERDOSE. IT IS INCREDIBLY STRESSFUL AND INCREDIBLY UNSTABLE TIME AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT WE SEND PEOPLE TO PRISON. FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME TEN YEARS AND MORE. WHEN THEY COME BACK AND? THEY'RE NOT THE SAME PERSON THEY WORE AND SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE MENTIONED THAT AND THEY NEED A SAFE PLACE AND WHICH TO READJUST. IN ORDER TO BE GOOD MEMBERS OF THEIR COMMUNITY -- IT'S AN INCREDIBLE BURDEN ON FAMILY MEMBERS TO SUDDENLY HAVE SOMEONE I KNOW I PERSONALLY FEEL BURDENED WHEN MY PARENTS STAY WITH ME FOR A WEEK EVEN IF THEY'RE LIVING IN A DIFFERENT. PLACE -- THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING TO FREQUENTLY -- THE SAME HOME IN WHICH THEY HAD COMMITTED THEIR CRIMES OF THEIR RETURN TO THEIR FAMILIES THEY MAY BE GOING TO THE SAME PLACE THEY WERE BEFORE. THEY WERE COMMITTED TO PRESENT -- THEIR FOOT ON THE COMING TO PLACES IN WHICH THERE ARE FEW FINANCIAL RESOURCES. AND THEY'RE SUDDENLY PUT IN A POSITION WHERE THEY'RE RELYING ON FAMILY MEMBERS TO FEED THEM TO HOUSE THEM TO CLOSE THEM -- TO TAKE THEM TO THEIR APPOINTMENTS THEIR HUGE HUGE NEEDS SOME PEOPLE NEED REGULAR DIALYSIS APPOINTMENTS SOME PEOPLE NEED MENTAL HEALTH MEDICATIONS SOME PEOPLE NEED. TO BE CONNECTED WITH SERVICES WITHIN THE COMMUNITY AND WITHOUT THE SUPPORT REENTRY SUPPORT. THEY'RE REALLY NOT EQUIPPED TO DO THAT AND IT'S INCREDIBLE BURDEN ON THEIR FAMILIES WHO FREQUENTLY ARE ALSO NOT EQUIPPED TO DO THAT -- MY EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH THIS POPULATION OVER THE PAST SEVEN YEARS HAS CONVINCED ME THAT HAVING HAD AN INDIVIDUAL HAS BEEN INCARCERATED RETURN TO THEIR COMMUNITIES TO PROFESSIONAL. WRAPAROUND REENTRY PROGRAMS IS KEY. TO REDUCING RECIDIVISM AND TO PRODUCING THE KIND OF OUTCOMES THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IN TERMS OF KEEPING OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. AND REALLY. I FEEL WE HAVE A BIT OF A MORAL OBLIGATION EVER GOING TO SEND PEOPLE TO PRISON FOR SUCH LONG PERIODS OF TIME. WE CAN'T JUST PUT THEM OUT ON THE STREET AND EXPECT THEM TO SUCCEED I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF BARRIERS. RIGHT NOW THAT EXIST BUREAUCRATIC BARRIERS THAT PREVENT PEOPLE ACCESS TO THE ACTUAL PROGRAMMING THAT IS THERE FOR THEM BUT MAYBE IT'S IN THE WRONG COUNTY. AND THERE'S ALSO I THINK A REAL DEARTH. OF REALLY GOOD SOLID PROGRAMS OUT THERE. DISPERSED AMONG ALL OF THE COUNTIES AND OUT OF A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT ARE INCARCERATED TODAY THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM. ARE COMING BACK TO THEIR COMMUNITIES AND IF WE WANT TO COMMUTERS TO BE SAFE WE NEED TO PROVIDE THEM. AND INVESTED IN THE SUPPORT OF SERVICES THAT THEY'RE GONNA NEED IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL. I'M. JUST A QUICK NOTE ON SOME OF THE COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS THAT ARE OFFERED I THINK THESE ARE ALSO VERY VALUABLE THEY PROVIDE. A LINK FREQUENTLY. BETWEEN INMATES INSIDE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES OUTSIDE AND IN THOSE PROGRAMS THEY ARE THEN ABLE TO TAKE THOSE EXPERIENCES AND THOSE SKILLS. AND BRING THEM INTO THE COMMUNITY THAT WAS THERE TO SERVE THEM IN PRISON SO IF I I HAVE A GREAT. RESPECT FOR AT PROGRAMS LIKE THAT -- PRISONERS DRAMATIC THEY COME OUT THEY'RE TRAUMATIZED THEY HAVE LOTS OF NEEDS AND I THINK. WE NEED TO BE THERE FOR THEM TO PROVIDE FOR THAT. IN A LETTER THESE DOWN AND TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT DO DO THAT PLEASE THANK YOU. SUSAN. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE IN ASSEMBLY -- PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DOUG BONHAM CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR AMITY FOUNDATION WERE -- FIVE OH ONE C. THREE NON PROFIT THAT OPERATES IN ARIZONA CALIFORNIA NEW MEXICO I COULD TELL YOU OF ALL THE THREE STATES THAT WE OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA IS BY FAR THE MOST PROGRESSIVE -- IN TERMS OF PROVIDING SERVICES WE PROVIDE TREATMENT EMPLOYMENT HEALTH AND WELLNESS VOCATIONAL TRAINING CASE MANAGEMENT CARE COORDINATION. HOUSING SERVICES AND THEN WE ALSO PROVIDE HIGH UTILIZE OR OUTCOMES BASED SERVICES ARE PERFORMANCE SPACE CONTRACTING AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER MENTION ONE OF THE PROGRAMS. THAT WE DESIGNED IS ACTUALLY IN LOS ANGELES IT'S A PAPER SUCCESS OR SOCIAL IMPACT BOND PROGRAM THAT'S ENTIRELY DRIVEN BY PERFORMANCE PRIVATELY FINANCE EN ROUTE AND FUNDED THROUGH THE COUNTY -- BASED ON OUR PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES. I WON'T SPEAK ABOUT WIDGETS AND I APPRECIATE SOME OF THE COMMENTS MENTION HERE TODAY -- BY EVERYONE AND SO I I WILL SAY THAT WE SERVE. ALL THAT REPRESENT ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND CHILDREN IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND SO ONE THING THAT ISN'T MENTION IS INDIRECT IMPACT OF INCARCERATION BASED ON THE FAMILIES AND THE COMMUNITIES. AND WE'RE CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT OF FIVE HUNDRED UNITS A PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IN SOUTH LA THOSE UNITS WILL BE. BUILT WITH MEN AND WOMEN THAT ARE FORMALLY INCARCERATED AS VOCATIONAL TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES AND ALSO WORK TO HOUSE MEN AND WOMEN THAT ARE HOMELESS IN THE COMMUNITY. AS CEO OF AMITY FOUNDATION I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR INSURING WE'RE PROVIDING MORE PATHWAYS FOR MEN WOMEN AND FAMILIES TO HEAL. AND I'LL SAY THAT MY INTRODUCTION AMITY FOUNDATION WAS NOT IS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER IS ACTUALLY AS A CHILD THAT WAS AND IT DOES OVER A DOZEN FOSTER HOMES GROWING UP -- I SPEND A LOT OF MY CHILDHOOD VISITING MY PARENTS IN PRISON YARDS AND BEHIND GLASS. AND ACTUALLY KNOW A LOT OF THE IMPACT OF INCARCERATION ON MY FAMILY AND TO OTHER FAMILIES IN THE COMMUNITY. I'VE LOST SEVERAL CLOSE FAMILY MEMBERS DUE TO INCARCERATION AND DRUG ADDICTION. AND I'LL SAY THAT -- THE I WAS PART OF A PILOT PROGRAM THAT WAS NOT EVIDENCE BASED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE TO HELP REUNITE MY FOR ME WITH MY FAMILY -- WAS UNTIL TEN YEARS LATER THAT THAT PROGRAM WAS EVIDENCE BASE IN TERMS OF HAVING ME STAY WITH MY FATHER AFTER HE WAS INCARCERATED WHILE HE WENT THROUGH -- TREATMENT AT AMITY FOUNDATION -- THE TODAY THAT PROGRAM IS ACTUALLY A REPLICATED ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND ACROSS THE WORLD. THE INTERVENTIONAL ALLOWED ME TO REUNITE WITH MY PARENTS SO THEY COULD BOTH RECEIVE SERVICES AFTER THEY WERE RELEASED FROM PRISON AMITY FOUNDATIONS ALSO HELP ME TO BREAK THE CYCLE OF INCARCERATION AND HELP TO ENSURE THAT AS A FATHER MY DAUGHTER WILL NEVER SEE. A WHAT IT'S LIKE TO VISIT A PRISON VISITING ROOM OR NEVER SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO SIX SEE ME BEHIND GLASS OR READ LETTERS ON A BIRTHDAY -- WHILE YOU'RE IN A FOSTER HOME WHERE ORPHANAGE. EXCUSE ME I'M SORRY -- THE SAME INTERVENTIONS WHY STAND HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY IN SUPPORT OF PROGRAMS TO HELP MEN AND WOMEN RETURN HOME SAFELY WITH SERVICES A LEAN THEY NEED MY STORY IS ABSOLUTELY NOT UNIQUE. THERE'S MANY CHILDREN THAT REPRESENT IN THE COMMUNITY MANY FAMILY MEMBERS THAT ARE REPRESENT IN THE COMMUNITY. THAT ARE IMPACTED IN A VERY LONG TERM AND SUCCESSFUL WAY BY PROGRAMS LIKE THIS. IN THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES UCLA AND NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DRUG ADDICTION DID A FIVE YEAR ROBUST EVALUATION OF CDC OUR PROGRAMS. AND WAS ACTUALLY AT ONE OF THE MD FOUNDATION PROGRAMS AND SHOWED A 40% REDUCTION OF RECIDIVISM. FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT COMPLETED IN PRISON AND COMMUNITY BASED TREATMENT I CAN'T STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF BOTH IN PRISON AND COMMUNITY BASED TREATMENT. THE IMPRISONED TREATMENT A COMPREHENSIVE AFTER CARE INCLUSIVE A LONG TERM RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT EMPLOYMENT SERVICES AND PLAYED PLACEMENT AND PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IS ESSENTIAL FOR A THREE PRONGED APPROACH TO OUR SUCCESSFUL RE ENTRY. WE HAVE WORKED IN COLLABORATION WITH CDC ARE TO IMPROVE AND ENHANCE SERVICES FOR THOSE RETURNING HOME FOR MY CAR SERRATION. AND FEEL THE SUCCESSFUL REENTRY MUST BE A COLLABORATIVE IN COMMUNITY APPROACH. COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE ESSENTIAL TO SUCCESSFUL REENTRY PUBLIC SAFETY AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION. AS MANY MENTION HERE TODAY POST REALIGNMENT WE'RE SERVING MORE SERIOUS VIOLENT OFFENDERS IN THE PRISON SYSTEM THAT HAVE TYPICALLY DONE LONGER STAYS IN THE PRISON. IN PRISON AND NEED MORE INTENSIVE SERVICES ALL ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT WAS A MENTION HERE TODAY. IS A DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN LENGTH OF STAY IN TREATMENT AND SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES. WE WORK IN COLLABORATION WITH MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES AND I'M HERE WITH TODAY STANFORD LAW WEST CARE AND AND DOZENS OF OTHER COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS. AND WE ALONE COULD NOT PROVIDE THESE SERVICES WITHOUT A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH IN THE COMMUNITY AND MANY OTHER PROVIDERS. IMPRISONING COMMUNITY AFTER CARE MUST BE LOOKED AT AS ONE TREATMENT EPISODE THAT TAKES PLACE IN TWO LOCATIONS THE FIRST TAKING PLACE INSIDE THE PRISON BUT IT MUST TRANSITION IN THE COMMUNITY FOR SUCCESSFUL AFTER CARE SERVICES. WE WORK CLOSELY WITH CDC ARE IN THEIR LEADERSHIP OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS I'VE WORK WITH THE PREVIOUS SECRETARY IN THE CURRENT SECRETARY AND EUROPEAN I FEEL THAT THEY'RE MAKING GREAT STEPS TO WORK TO LISTEN. TO PROVIDERS TO INCORPORATE WHAT WE KNOW IS BEST PRACTICES EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES AND MANY OF THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE SUPPORTIVE OF OURS SUCH AS THE DOG PROGRAM. IN ARTS AND CORRECTION ARE NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED WITH OURS BUT I'VE SEEN THE IMPACT TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR PROGRAMS. WE SUPPORT THE NEED FOR MORE RESEARCH AND OUTCOMES DRIVEN SERVICE MODELS IN A WORKING IN COLLABORATION WITH CDC OUR COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS AND OTHER STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES DEVELOP A COLLABORATOR SERVICE MODEL NECESSARY. FOR THOSE RETURNING HOME TO RECEIVE ALL OF THE ESSENTIAL SERVICES SUCH A SUDDEN SOME USE. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PRIMARY CARE SERVICES EDUCATION VOCATIONAL TRAINING EMPLOYMENT SERVICES FAMILY SUPPORT SERVICES IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING JUST TO NAME A FEW. THE LINKAGES BETWEEN AND CUSTODY SERVICES AS I MENTIONED IN COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES ARE ESSENTIAL FOR SUCCESSFUL RECIDIVISM REDUCTION AND WE HOPE TO SEE MORE SUPPORT FOR THE SERVICES IN THE FUTURE. IF I WAS GOING TO SHARE THIS OR NOT I WENT BACK AND FORTH ON IT BUT I WANT TO SHARE ONE MORE STORY -- THERE'S A SEVEN YEAR OLD GIRL WHO LOST HER MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER LAST YEAR TO A HEROIN OVERDOSE IN A FATHER WHOSE ONLY SEEN A FEW MONTHS IN OUR LIFE. HIGHS BEEN INCARCERATED FIVE TIMES NOW. SHE'S INTELLIGENT YOUNG LOVING BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL AND UNFORTUNATELY SHE LIVES IN A STATE WHERE THESE KIND OF SERVICES ARE SIMPLY JUST NOT AVAILABLE BOTH FOR HER MOTHER AND FOR HER FATHER -- THAT THE YOUNG LADY IS MY NIECE I'M IN THE PROCESS OF WORKING ON THE ADOPTION RIGHT NOW WITH MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER BRINGING HER HERE TO CALIFORNIA. I WANT TO MENTION THAT BECAUSE EVERYTHING WE DISCUSS HERE HAS A VERY HUMAN AND HAPPEN TO IT -- I IN I DID SHARE THAT STORY NOT JUST TO SHOW -- THE HUMAN ASPECT OF IT BUT JUST TO REMIND THAT CALIFORNIA IS TAKING PROGRESSIVE STEPS WE LOOK AT SO MANY EVIDENCE BASED MODELS THAT ARE IN OTHER STATES. CALIFORNIA TRULY SHOULD BE AN EVIDENCE BASED MODEL WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE NEEDS TO BE EVALUATED AND IT DOES NEED TO BE THE EVIDENCE BASED MODEL MANY OF THE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT AND I'VE HEARD TODAY. ARE MODELS THAT ARE REPLICATED FROM OTHER STATES AND I'D REALLY LIKE TO SEE CALIFORNIA BECOME THE LEADER IN TERMS OF RECIDIVISM REDUCTION. IN THE UNITED STATES. JUST A FEW PROGRAMS THAT I THINK WERE MENTIONED HERE EARLIER TODAY'S M. C. R. P. PROGRAMMER THE MEN'S COMMUNITY RANCHER PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO STAY THE LAST YEAR THERE SENS ON AN ANKLE MONITOR IN THE COMMUNITY. AND THOSE PROGRAMS ARE SEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL RESULTS WE COUPLED WITH -- THE LIFE FOR PROGRAMS WERE LIFERS ARE ACTUALLY SERVING AS MENTORS THEY'RE RECEIVING SOME OF THE SERVICES THEY NEED. AND WE'RE ACTUALLY ABLE TO HIRE A LARGE AMOUNT OF OUR WORK FORCE IT'S FORMALLY INCARCERATED I THINK THE STATE SHOULD ALSO LOOK AT PROVIDERS THAT EMPLOYEE MEN AND WOMEN THAT ARE FORMALLY INCARCERATED. AND SHOULD PROVIDE PATHWAYS OF EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE NONPROFITS A COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS ARE A LARGE EMPLOYER IN THE COMMUNITY AS WELL. JUST A LITTLE BIT OF A DATA POINT HERE AND ONE THING THAT OFTEN GETS LEFT OUT IS YOUR SEVEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE RE INCARCERATED A RETURN TO PRISON IF YOU'RE HOMELESS. THERE'S A HUGE DISCONNECT IN TERMS OF THE SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED HERE AND ACCESS TO PERMANENT AFFORDABLE AND SAFE HOUSING -- I TRULY DO BELIEVE. IN THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS DISCUSSION ON RETURN ON INVESTMENT I BELIEVE THAT IF WE'RE GIVEN THE ELEMENTS FOR SUCCESSFUL REENTRY SERVICES WE SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO THOSE STANDARDS. THEN THERE SHOULD BE A DIRECT RETURN ON THAT INVESTMENT -- SOME OF THE THINGS THAT IN TERMS OF BEST PRACTICES IN EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES ARE A LOT OF AT BEST PRACTICES THAT COMPLEMENT OUR EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES OF NO **** OFF ABSOLUTELY BE INCLUDED. SOME OF THE WORK FORCE AS I MENTION IS ESSENTIAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT EMPLOYMENT AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE A 85% PLACEMENT RATE INTO EMPLOYMENT SERVICES ENDED SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENT. WHEN THEY'RE IN OUR COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS AND I'LL JUST AND ON THE NOTE THAT AGAIN I REALLY EMPLOYEE DID LOOK AT THE LENGTH OF STAY IN TREATMENT IT IS NOT SIMPLY JUST PUTTING PEOPLE IN SLOTS AND FILLING PROGRAMS? AND CYCLING THEM THROUGH AND SHORT TERM STAYS WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S LONG TERM AND COMPREHENSIVE AND THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING THESE. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK THAT'S WE WERE MENTIONING UP HERE'S THE HUMANITY AND ALL OF THIS AND NOT. MISTER JONES SAWYER SAID WIDGETS. AND SO PUSH IT THAT PLEASE CONTINUE. WHAT WHAT IS START OUT WITH WITH GOOD AFTERNOON IS NOW GOOD EVENING -- SIR CHAIRED THAT THE NUMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M JOHN JENKINS SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT -- FOR FOR WEST CARE AND WERE ALSO NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT PROVIDES SERVICES TO THE MOST -- CRITICALLY NEEDED -- POPULATION ARE INDIGENT POPULATION AND IN THE COMMUNITY WE PROVIDE SERVICES SUCH AS CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES TREATMENT AND REHABILITATION MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS -- VETERANS SERVICES AND EDUCATION PREVENTION AS WELL AS HOUSING SERVICES. WE ALSO PROVIDE SERVICES THAT SEVEN OF THE LOCATION SEVEN OF THE IN PRISON LOCATIONS THAT THE RP -- HAS WE ALSO PROVIDE -- TO SERVICES AT TWO COMMUNITY -- TO CUSTODY TO COMMUNITY TRANSITIONAL REENTRY PROGRAMS WHICH IS THE SISTER PROGRAM TO THE M. C. R. P. IT'S CALLED C. C. TRP IT'S FOR FOR FOR WOMEN IN WHERE WOMEN CAN BE -- COME INTO -- COMMUNITY SETTING. AND FINISH THE REST OF THEIR SENTENCE -- WE ALSO PROVIDE SERVICES AND WHAT'S CALLED STOP IS SPECIALIZED TREATMENT FOR OPTIMIZED PROGRAMMING THERE'S THAT'S THE AFTER CARE NETWORK FOR IMPRISONED TREATMENT PROGRAMS -- I HAVE TO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE BEFORE ME THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT TREATMENT INSIDE. COUPLED WITH THE COMMUNITY AS ONE EPISODE. AND THAT EPISODE NEEDS TO NOT BE BROKEN -- YOU DON'T BREAK A CYCLE OF TREATMENT SO IF YOU IF YOU'RE PROVIDING TREATMENT IN THE INSTITUTION IT NEEDS TO GO FROM THE INSTITUTION TO THE COMMUNITY. NOT FROM TREATMENT BACK TO GENERAL POPULATION. AND THEN LATER TO BE IN THE INSTITUTE IN THE COMMUNITY SO IT NEEDS TO BE ONE PROGRESSIVE -- EPISODE -- I'D LIKE. TO YOU KNOW REALLY TALK ABOUT THE COMMUNITY TO CUSTODY REENTRY PROGRAM -- ALSO KNOWN AS C. C. T. R. P. WESKER OPERATES TO THESE PROGRAMS ONES AND SAN DIEGO IS A HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN BAD PROGRAM AND THE OTHER ONE IN STOCKTON CALIFORNIA WAS JUST A FIFTY PROGRAM. THESE ARE PROGRAMS -- FOR WOMEN WHO ARE SERVING THE REMAINDER OF THEIR SENTENCE IN THE COMMUNITY AND A COMMUNITY PROGRAM. LIKE THE M. C. R. PEAS A ALL HAVE -- ANKLE MONITORS ON THEY CAN COME THERE THEY HAVE A LITTLE BIT LONGER STAY SO THEY CAN COME WITH A MINIMUM OF FORTY FIVE DAYS LEFT ON THEIR SENTENCE. UP TO TWO YEARS LEFT ON THEIR SENS WHILE THEY'RE THERE THEY CAN RECEIVE -- DRUG AND ALCOHOL EDUCATION BUDGETING -- EDUCATIONAL THINGS THAT AT A CERTAIN POINT THEY CAN GO OUT AND START GOING BACK TO SCHOOL GET A JOB SAVE MONEY IT'S NOT UNCOMMON WE HAD A LADY THAT -- CLEATED COMPLETED THE PROGRAM NOT TOO LONG AGO THAT LEFT -- WHILE PAYING HER RESTITUTION AND ALL THINGS FOR A REQUIRED LEFT WITH NINETEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS SAVED TO RE INTEGRATE BACK INTO THE INTO THE COMMUNITY. AND I THINK THAT THESE PROGRAMS SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT ARE LOOKED AT TO BE REPLICATED BECAUSE THEY ALLOW THAT SLOWER -- REINTEGRATION BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY OF THEY ALLOW THAT TIME AND I THINK THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL -- I DON'T HAVE ANY LONG TERM DATE ON IT BUT I CAN TELL YOU OUT OF THE TWO PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE -- STARTING JUST FROM JULY TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN UP UNTIL MARCH OF THIS YEAR WE HAD -- FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE WOMEN DOES CHARGE THE PROGRAM. OF THAT FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY WERE SUCCESSFULLY DISCHARGED -- ON A PAROLE AND SO THAT'S A SEVENTY NINE POINT 2% SUCCESS RATE AND THESE ARE ALL VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS SO -- THEIR WOMEN THE VOLUNTEER FOR THE PROGRAM COME THERE AND IF THEY DON'T WANT TO BE IN THE PROGRAM THEY CAN ASK TO BE. SENT BACK -- THE OTHER PROGRAM I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IS THE SPECIALIZED TREATMENT FOR OPTIMIZE PROGRAMMING THE STOP PROGRAM AND THAT'S THE AFTER CARE. NOW WORK FOR OUR IN PRISON TREATMENT PROGRAMS -- THIS RELIES ON COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS IN EACH COUNTY -- TO BE THE RE ENTRY -- LOCATION FOR PEOPLE COMING OUT IT'S PRIORITIZE FOR PEOPLE WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR OF RELEASE HE EITHER UPON RELEASE OF THE FIRST YEAR OF RELEASE. BUT ANYBODY ON PAROLES ELIGIBLE -- THIS PROGRAM I THINK IS IS SUCCESSFUL IT RELIES ON GOOD COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS THAT ARE THAT ARE IN EACH COMMUNITY TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES THEY CAN PROVIDE RESIDENTIAL. OUTPATIENT AND SOBER LIVING IN TRANSITIONAL HOUSING SERVICES -- I THINK THAT THE PROGRAM COULD USE SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING BECAUSE THERE IS NOT WALT WHILE THE R. P. I THINK ALLOCATES ALL FUNDING THAT THEY HAVE TOWARDS IT -- THERE IS A GREATER NEED OF PEOPLE COME IN -- PER ALL COMING TO US FOR PLACEMENTS THEN WE HAVE THE THE ABILITY TO PLAY SINCE AWAITING LESSER ARE -- HAPPENING BECAUSE OF THAT WITHIN THE STOP NETWORK WE ARE WORKING WITH THE R. P. TO LEVERAGE MEDI CAL THROUGH THE ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM. AND I KNOW THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT HOW DO WE LEVERAGE OTHER FUNDING -- BUT I THINK THE KEY THING IS TO REALIZE HAT NUMBER ONE IT. AND SOME COUNTIES DIDN'T OFTEN. PERIOD SO IT'S NOT AVAILABLE IN EVERY COUNTY SO WE ARE WORKING WITH THEM TO ROLL THIS OUT AND USE THAT TO TO LEVERAGE THE FUNDS -- I THINK THAT -- WHEN I WHEN I LOOK AT THIS I LOOK AT WE TALK ABOUT EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMMING SOMETIMES EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAM IS A LITTLE TRICKY. BECAUSE YOU TALK ABOUT EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMMING PRACTICES. WELL THESE PROGRAMS A LOT OF TIMES WHEN THEY GET ON THESE ON THESE LISTS WERE DONE. IN A REALLY. HEIGHTENED CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT WHETHER SPECIFIC POPULATION WITH SPECIFIC FUNDING LEVELS -- FOR A SPECIFIC PERSON AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS REP OF GLOBAL EXACTLY -- SO WE HAVE TO WATCH APPLES FOR APPLES IS THAT REALLY THE SAME POPULATION IS IT REALLY THE SAME CONDITIONS IS IT REALLY. IS EVERYTHING THE SAME SO IF YOU WANT TO DO THE STATS THEN YOU REALLY HAVE TO COMPARE APPLES TO APPLES -- YOU CAN'T SAY WELL THIS POPULATION GOT TO GO THROUGH THIS PROGRAM -- SPECIFICALLY WITH NO INTERRUPTIONS IN THIS POPULATION WELL YEAH THEY HAD. HALF THE TIME THEY WERE IN THERE THEY GOT LOCKED DOWN AND BECAUSE OF OTHER THINGS THAT HAPPENED. AND SO HOW DO YOU COMPARE THE TWO JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE SAME CURRICULUM DOESN'T MAKE A COMPARISON OF THE TWO I THINK CDC ARE WORKS. OUT REALLY GOOD AND WE'VE HAD GOOD CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM ABOUT THE RIGHT PERSON. IN THE RIGHT PROGRAM AT THE RIGHT TIME. SO I THINK THAT IF YOU DO THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE THE BEST OUTCOMES -- I THINK THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT UGH. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT -- CDC ARE NEED SOME FLEXIBILITY IN THERE AND SOME OF THEIR CONTRACTING TO ADAPT TO CHANGES THAT HAPPEN. CHANGES IN THE ENVIRONMENT CHANGES AND SO WE HAVE A CONTRACT THAT COMES ALONG AND NOW ALL THE SUDDEN YOU HAVE WILL JUST GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE THE ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM AND NOW -- MEDICAID MEDICARE WAS PAYING FOR RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT WILL WHAT USED TO BE A LEVEL OF REIMBURSEMENT WILL SAY IS EIGHTY ONE DOLLARS A DAY IS NOW GONE UP TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE DOLLARS A DAY IN YOUR BE ABLE TO HIRE STAFF. AT HIGHER SALARIES AND THINGS LIKE THIS AND SO THE MARKET CHANGES AND IF YOU'RE STUCK IN CONTRACTS FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND YOU CAN'T ADAPT TO THOSE MARKET CHANGES. THAT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO HIRE STAFF RETAIN STAFF AND DO THOSE THINGS AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT -- ALSO -- WHAT THEY'RE WHAT THE STAFFING YOU KNOW VACANCIES ARE. UNLESS YOU KNOW STAFF MEMBERS GONNA DO SOME. STRANGE THAT'S GET OUT GET THEM FIRED ARE THERE GOING TO GO LOOK FOR A JOB AND THEY TELL USE SEVERAL TIMES MONTHS IN ADVANCE. IF SOMEBODY JUST LEAVES ARE AS REMOVED FROM A PROGRAM. IT'S TIME ONE TO ADVERTISE TO TO GET A BACKGROUND CLARENCE DONE. THREE TO DO YOU KNOW DO YOUR INTERVIEWING AND ALL THAT. YOUR YOUR PHYSICAL YOUR YOUR DRUG TEST BACKGROUND TO SO IT TAKES TIME SO IT'S VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP THESE PROGRAMS FAILED STAFFING WISE A THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE DON'T STRIVE FOR IT BUT IS IT IS TOUGH -- I THIS REMINDS ME OF A OF A QUOTE THAT -- HARRY TRUMAN'S THAT IT SAYS IT'S AMAZING WHAT YOU CAN DO WHEN YOU ACCOMPLISH. IT'S AMAZING WHAT YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH IF YOU DON'T CARE WHO GETS THE CREDIT. I THINK THAT ALSO NEEDS TO LOOK AT WHO TAKES THE BLAME. AND I THINK WE HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE WITH CDC ARE IN THE RP I THINK WE ALL TAKE THE BLAME FOR SOME OF THE RESULTS -- SOME OTHER THINGS -- THAT AND I APPLAUD THEIR OPENNESS TO LISTEN DASS PROVIDERS AS VENDORS IN TO SAY HEY THIS DOESNT WORK -- THIS DOESN'T WORK IF -- WE NEED TO MAKE A CHANGE HERE THIS ISN'T GONNA GIVE US A SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME AND I THINK THAT THEY ARE LISTENING. AND THEY ARE WILLING TO TO MAKE THE CHANGE AND MAYBE THE AUDIT DIDN'T SHOW THAT BUT I COULD TELL YOU OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM SHOWS ADAPTABILITY AND AND BEING WILLING TO CHANGE -- BUT I THINK IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF TIME YEAH AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE EVERYONE'S EXPERIENCE OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LONG TIME. CAN HELP INFORM THE DISCUSSION ARE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THE OUTCOME SO IT'S NOT IT'S LOOKING AT THE DATA BUT LOOKING THROUGH IT WITH THE LANDS OF ONE COMPARING APPLES APPLES. MAYBE YOU'RE COMPARING YOU KNOW A LEVEL TWO IN MAY TO A LEVEL TWO IN MAY BUT WHAT FACILITY AND SEE WHAT THOSE TRENDS ARE. BECAUSE YOU CAN YOU KNOW LOOK AT ONE FACILITY AND MAYBE IT WAS A LOCK DOWN A LOT MORE OFTEN THAN ANOTHER FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. BUT SEEING WHAT THOSE OUTCOMES ARE. AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS -- WHAT ARE THOSE BEST OUTCOMES AND THAT'S WHY WE KEEP? ASKING FOR THE ANALYTICS I THINK THE AUDITOR'S REPORT IS ASKING FOR THOSE. NOT TO SAY SOMEONE'S DOING SOMETHING WRONG. BUT TO REALLY INFORM THE DISCUSSION ON HOW DO WE KEEP DOING IT RIGHT. HOW MUCH OF THOSE PROGRAMS ARE DOING IT RIGHT AND HOW DO WE MAXIMIZE ON THAT? I APPRECIATE YOUR GUISES TESTIMONY BECAUSE I DO THINK AND IT NEEDS TO BE A WRAPAROUND SERVICES THINK -- THAT'S WHAT -- MISS CHAMPION WAS TALKING ABOUT. IT AND ALL OF YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT HOW DO WE DO IT DIGEST. NCDC ARW BUT WHEN THEY COME OUT AND I KNOW I'VE BEEN PRIVY TO SEE SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS -- IN MY OWN BACKYARD WHERE. IF NAY MAY TRULY WANTS TO NOT GO BACK IN THE SYSTEM IS HOW DO WE CONNECT THEM WITH THE SERVICES. TO GIVE THEM THE MAXIMUM. CHANCE AT AT SUCCESS. AT HOLDING DOWN A JOB AT CONNECTING WITH SERVICES IF THE NEED SERVICES SPECIALLY IF THEY HAVE CHILDREN AND LOVED ONES. RIGHT IN THAT AS A MOTIVATION TO CONTINUE TO MOVE THEM FORWARD SOME JUST ASK A GENERAL QUESTION OF ALL OF YOU AND THAT'S JUST -- YOU KNOW WHAT MORE WOULD YOU GUYS NEED FROM SAY EITHER CDC ARE THE STATE TO ACTUALLY HELP WITH THESE OUTCOMES BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE IN TERMS OF WHAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE. SO IS THERE SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED. TO HELP WITH THAT LOVE TO HEAR YOUR RESPONSES. THIS BIG GENERALLY ALLEYS OUR PROGRAM HAS A RE ENTRY PROGRAM THAT WE DESIGNED WITH FORMER INMATES. THROUGH THE ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION WE HAVE FORMER FORMER INMATES PICK UP. FROM THE PRISON GATES THEY ARE IN A POSITION TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THEM. THAT PROGRAM WAS PICKED UP BY THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE AND SO WE STARTED DOING THAT FOR FEDERAL CLEMENCY RECIPIENTS SO WE WOULD HAVE OUR TEAM OF FORMERLY INCARCERATED GO MEET THEM. PICK THEM UP THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE FEDERAL INMATES WOULD GO ON TO WHAT'S CALLED OF RESIDENTIAL REENTRY CENTER RC. TWO IF YOU'RE A FEDERAL INMATE WE FOUND IT AMAZING TO KNOW THAT. OUR CLIENTS WERE ACTUALLY GOING SOME PLACE WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE SECURITY WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE. SOME STRUCTURE WHERE THEY WOULDN'T BE A BURDEN ON THEIR FAMILIES WHERE THEY HAVE ACCESS TO SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PROGRAMMING WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSE OR SOCIAL SECURITY CARD IN THERE IS THAT ALL THE PAPERWORK THAT THEY NEED. AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOME VOCATIONAL TRAINING AND TO WORK WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. I'M WE FOUND THAT MODEL. WELL SOMEWHAT -- UNEVENLY ADMINISTERED EVERY STATE HAD THERE ARE SEASON EVERYBODY HAD ACCESS TO THE R. C. ANYBODY WAS COMING OUT COULD GO AND MOST DID GO TO THE R. C.. AND WE FELT THAT THAT REALLY WAS. AN INCREDIBLE. VALUE AND A RELIEF TO THEM TO KNOW THAT THEY HAD A PLACE TO GO. AND THAT THAT PLACE WAS GOING TO SUPPORT THEM IN THEIR SOBRIETY GOALS IN THEIR LOCATION UNCLES IN THEIR BEHAVIOR REHABILITATION GOALS. SO THAT I THINK. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS AN IDEAL MODEL HAVING SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN EVERY COUNTY THAT HAD CAPACITY BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT'S BEEN -- SORT OF INTIMATED THAT THERE'S A GREAT. NEED FOR MORE OF THESE THAT THESE SERVICES AND FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME. KNOW WHAT'S ONE OF THE MODELS WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY LOOK TO WHERE THIS IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING. THE CZ TRP THEN THE M. C. R. PAYS THAT WAY THEY HAVE THEY ALREADY DO IT AND I THINK THAT. I THINK YOU KNOW ONE OF THE AND NOW THIS GETS WILL. WILL. OUT THERE A LITTLE BIT BUT IF WE BECAUSE THEY'RE INMATES WHEN THEY WHEN THEY'RE IN THESE PROGRAMS. THEN THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAL SERVICES SO I THINK THAT IF THERE WAS A WAY YOU TALK ABOUT LEGISLATIVELY HOW COULD YOU DO SOMETHING. IF THERE WAS A DIFFERENT DESIGNATION -- AND THEY WEREN'T NECESSARILY INMATES NUMBER ONE THEIR HEALTHCARE COSTS WOULD GET PAID FOR THROUGH MEDICARE ALL INSTEAD OF CDC ARE -- YOU CAN ALSO IT WOULDN'T BE A PANACEA SO WOULDN'T COVER EVERY PLACE BUT YOU COULD LEVERAGE MEDI CAL FOR TREATMENT SERVICES IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS -- THAT COULD REDUCE SOME COST I THINK ALSO THERE WAS -- WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT AND AND I THINK IT WAS ALREADY SPOKE ABOUT WITH? THE S. A. T. F. WHEN YOU'RE IN YOU'RE IN CUSTODY PROGRAMS IF YOU CAN HOUSE PEOPLE IN THE PROGRAM TOGETHER -- AND HOUSE THEM TOGETHER WHEN THEY'RE IN THE PROGRAM TO KEEP THEM HOUSE TOGETHER. AND IF THEY AND IF THEY IF THEY PAROLE FROM THAT PROGRAM BECAUSE ONE YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO THINK OF IT KIND OF JUST. TEN IN GENERAL TERMS IF YOU ARE. IF. IF YOU HAVE AN ALCOHOLIC AND HE GOES TO TREATMENT DO YOU WANT THAT ALCOHOLIC TO GO FROM OUTPATIENT TREATMENT BACK TO AN ALCOHOLIC HOME. EVERY NIGHT. NO YOU DON'T THAT'S NOT THE BEST CASE SCENARIO -- FOR CAN THEY MAKE IT. CERTAINLY THERE'S BEEN PEOPLE THAT HAVE DONE IT. BUT DOES THE STATE STATISTICS SAY THAT IT'S A LOT MORE DIFFICULT YES IT IS AND SO IF WE IF WE TAKE SOMEBODY THAT'S IN A PROGRAM. AND THEN YOU PUT HIM BACKINTO A MIXED HOUSING UNIT WORK NOW I HAVE TO ACT THIS WAY SO I GOT A PROTECT MYSELF HERE. AND THEN I'M SUPPOSED TO GO AND FLIPPED THE LIGHT SWITCH WHEN I GO BACK TO PROGRAM. IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT AND THEY'RE ALREADY HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME. AND SO THEN. SO THEN TO WHAT I TALKED ABOUT THE THE SEAMLESS EPISODE THEN TO TAKE THEM INCOMPLETE THAT PROGRAM AND THEIR SENTENCE NOT BE DONE YET. TO PUT THEM BACK IN THE GENERAL POPULATION YOU'VE KIND OF SUCK THAT. EVERYTHING BACK OUT OF THEM -- AND IT AND IT'S HARD CAN THEY STILL MAKE IT YES THERE'S A GIVEN THE BEST RESULTS NO I DON'T THINK SO -- AND I THINK THAT WE'VE TALKED WITH THE RP ABOUT I THINK THAT THEY AGREE WITH US. AND I THINK THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT HOW CAN HOW CAN THEY DO THAT HOW CAN THEY MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS. BUT I DO THINK THAT THE YOU KNOW THE STOP ARE A GREAT EXAMPLE OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE SUCCESSFUL THE THE M. C. R. PEAS IN THE C. C. T. R. PEAS. ARE REALLY GOOD EXAMPLES OF WHERE YOU CAN TAKE THE IN THE SOMEBODY SENTENCE AND RE INTEGRATE THEM BACK AND SAY FULLY WITH THAT SUPPORTS. AND THEY CAN GET A JOB THEY CAN CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION. AND GET THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED AT THE SAME TIME. SO FROM BOCES IN AND SEAN BOTH EXPRESSED THINGS THAT I WOULD SUPPORT FULLY AND I WOULD JUST ADD TO THAT -- THE CERTAINLY RIGHT NOW THE PROCESS SHOULD BE WHERE WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOING THE RESEARCH SO ON OUR FEDERAL GRANTS THERE'S ACTUALLY A RESEARCH COMPONENT THAT'S FUNDED BY SAM SO THAT WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOING THE RESEARCH ON OUR OWN PROGRAMS. THROUGH A THIRD PARTY IN PROVIDING THAT TO OUR FUNDING SOURCES -- THAT'S THAN THE REQUEST FOR QUALIFICATION PROCESS AND ACTUALLY PUTS A RESPONSIBILITY ON THE PROVIDER TO DO SOMETHING IN TERMS OF SOLVING FOR THE SOLUTION OF RECIDIVISM REDUCTION -- THERE'S A BARRIER SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS WITH EMPLOYMENT SERVICES THAT'S VERY -- DRIVEN BY WIDGET SO IF YOU'RE ITS PLACEMENT DRIVEN SO YOU'RE INCENTIVIZE FOR THE NUMBER PLACE AND SAID OUR POPULATIONS CONSIDERED A HIGH BARRIER POPULATION TO SERVE SO THE PRISON TO EMPLOYMENT INITIATIVE EXPANDING ON THAT BECAUSE THAT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST. INITIATIVES THAT SAID YOU WILL SERVICE HIGH BARRIER POPULATION -- AND FUND EMPLOYMENT SERVICES FOR THAT AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT HOUSING MORE HOUSING SO WHAT WERE YOUR WHAT SEAN'S ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THIS IS AN AND A LOT OF THE PROGRAMS ARE ALREADY FUNDING IN THE PRISON IN THE COMMUNITY. BUT IF PEOPLE CANNOT GET INTO A AFFORDABLE HOUSING AT THE END OF ALL THIS YOU MADE A LARGE INVESTMENT WITH THE LIKELIHOOD THAT SOMEBODY WILL RETURN BACK TO CAR INCARCERATIONS. I JUST WANT TO ADD ONE THING TOO IS THAT NOT EVERYBODY WHO COMES OUT OF CDC OUR CUSTODY IS ON PAROLE. AND IN MANY CASES IF YOU'RE NOT ON PAROLE OR IF THAT THERE'S A PROGRAM THAT'S DESIGNATED FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE ON PAROLE. THAT'S A HUGE BARRIER TO A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO JUST LEFT PRISON BUT THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THESE PROGRAMS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT IN THE RIGHT DESIGNATION AND OPENING THOSE SERVICES UP. TO ANYONE WHO'S LEFT PRISON BUT ALSO I THINK BE A HUGE -- POSITIVE. WHICH I THINK IS -- WOULD ADD TO THAT JUST SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION BECAUSE YOU HAVE EVERY COUNTY DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF RE ENTRY SERVICES. AND THEN YOU HAVE THE PAROLE SYSTEM PROVIDING COMPREHENSIVE ROBUST COMMUNITY SERVICES IN A CERTAIN DESIGN WAY. THANK YOU ONE METER FOR MISTER JONES SAWYER. AND SO I I KIND OF ONE OF FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO DO PROGRAMS ON THE OUTSIDE INSIDE HOW TO BLEND AND WE PUT THEM WE REALLY DO PROBABLY NEED TO SIT. AND HAVE THAT DISCUSSION -- AS MR SALAS WHAT WILL TELL YOU. AN INSTA VOEPEL THERE'S THERE BEEN EVEN TIMES WERE REACH SAID. LOOK SOMEONE'S EIGHTY YEARS OLD THEY'RE IN PRISON. THE ONE LEG A DIABETIC THAT'S ON DIALYSIS AND WE HAVE MEMBERS ARE SAFE LET THEM STAY. BECAUSE THEY'RE DANGEROUS. AND BUT WE CAN GET HIM OUT. AND THEN MAKE WE CAN PUT HIM ON THE FEDERAL -- TAXPAYERS IS IT -- DOLLAR TOLL. BUT NO WE'RE NOT GONNA LET THEM OUT AND SO -- WHAT? I DON'T KNOW IF WE NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHAT KIND OF SAFE ENVIRONMENT. CAN WE KEEP THE ONE LADY DIABETIC. THAT'S ON DIALYSIS WHAT KIND OUR GROUP HOME OR WORKING WE PUT IN WHERE PEOPLE FEEL SAFE THAT DOES INDIVIDUAL. WON'T ROB A BANK THE NEXT DAY SO MAYBE WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO FIGURE THAT OUT. BECAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE -- SECRETARY DS WOULD LOVE TO GET SOME MALES EXPENSES OFF OF HIS MEDICAL SIDE -- COULD BE IT COULD HELP A LOT AND SO WE LET'S. MAYBE WE CAN WORK TOGETHER. TO TO FIGURE THAT OUT SO THAT WE CAN LEGISLATE TO DONOVAN AND THERE WERE -- FORMER LIFERS THAT BECAUSE OF BEING PARDON OR WHATEVER THEY'RE NOW OUT. THEY'RE GOING BACK IN OF THEIR OWN PRO IS JUST KINDA ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION I JUST. SOME SPORADIC PROGRAM IS SO PAGES PLEASE LIFERS ARE GOING IN. WITH THE WITH THE UNDERSTANDING FROM THE WARDEN TO DATE THEY'VE WORKED IT OUT THEY WERE DOES SECURITY CONCERNS OBVIOUSLY. AND AND I'VE HEARD THESE LIFERS. SAY IT'S PROBABLY ONE THE BEST THING THAT'S EVER HAPPENED. AND AND THEN BEING NAIVE I'VE I'VE SAID THINGS LIKE WHAT TELL YOU SAME THING ABOUT YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO STAY IN SCHOOL. LEARN A TRADE AND ALL THAT AND THEY'LL GIVE IT A YEAH BUT YOU'RE NEVER LIFE. FOR YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN WHEN THEY PUSH BACK ON ME I YOU KNOW I I CAN'T I DON'T KNOW IT'S LIKE I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY GOT TO THAT. POINT I DON'T KNOW HOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO GET SOMEONE OUT THESE GUYS. TO AND A RESPECTED AND SO HOW DO WE GROW THAT PROGRAM WERE FORMER LIFERS CAN COME IN. AND ACTUALLY START TALKING TO INDIVIDUAL ABOUT WHAT IS WHAT DO THEY NEED. TO GO OUT AND SOMEONE JUST SAID. HE'D. HE JUST SAID THE RIGHT THING. HE KNEW HE COULD FEEL MY PAIN HE COULD HE UNDERSTOOD MY TRAUMA WHEN I WAS YOUNGER. WE MET FACT WE HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM AND WE WENT TO THE SAME TERRIBLE PATH. AND NOW WHEN HE SAYS YOU NEED TO DO THIS THIS THIS THIS AND THAT TO GET OUT OF HERE IT MAKES SENSE TO ME BECAUSE HE DID IT. IF I TOLD SAME THING. YOU KNOW SELECT YOUR CHILDREN IN TERMS OF AN OVER OVER AGAIN AND THEN. SIR FROM STEP ONE IS TO HEAR FROM SOMEBODY ELSE LIKE MR SOLACE THEY ALL YEAH IS A GREAT IDEA AND SO -- IF WE COULD FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO MORE THOSE WROTE ROBUST PROGRAMS AND AND YOU CAN COMMENT ON THAT TOO AND THEN THE LAST. THE LAST THING. I READ THAT THE FIRST LADY OF NEW YORK. IS WORKING WITH FEMALE INMATES TO CONNECTING WITH THEIR CHILDREN. AND FAMILIES AND SO I STE I STARTED LEGISLATION THAT WAS SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR SO THAT -- WHEN WE JUST HAD CHILDREN COULD STILL BREASTFEED? BECAUSE IT IS IN MY OPINION -- WHETHER GOING ON DRUGS WHETHER YOU'RE FOLLOWING SOME CRIMINALITY WHETHER WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING THAT'S BAD. I STILL THINK. THIS THIS INSTINCT TO BE A MOTHER. WELL OVERCOME A LOT OF THAT AND WE NEED OF STAR FOSTER IN AT AND SO I THINK. THE THE NEW YORK. IN REIKERS THEY ACTUALLY ARE CONNECTING. THE CHILDREN I DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S DONE IT'S GOT TO BE SOME OUTSIDE INSIDE THING -- SO THAT OUR INTER FUNNY THAT THESE THESE WOMEN WHO ARE INCARCERATED. ARE GOING OUT OF THEIR WAY. TO GET THESE PROGRAMS TO CUT DOWN THERE THE THIRD TIME THE CREDIT TIME AND ALL OF THAT SO YOU CAN GET OUT AND GET RECONNECTED TO HER FAMILY. BECAUSE ONCE YOU'RE DISCONNECTED FROM YOUR FAMILY YOU'RE. YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE IN THAT. YOU'RE CUTTING THAT PRISON POPULATION MENTALITY YOU DON'T WANT TO GET OUT AND SO HOW DO WE HOW DO WE FIGURE THAT OUT. SO WE CAN MAYBE IT'S TO DO THAT AND CDC ARE -- SO SOON IN IN THE WOMEN'S FACILITIES -- AND I THINK WE COULD GET SOME AMAZING -- RESULTS FROM THAT IF WE WERE. TO HAVE WOMEN -- STAY CONNECTED TO THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES. SO PICK ONE ANYONE OR JUST. IN GENERAL START WITH THE FIRST THE FIRST ONE IN TERMS AYE UTILIZES OF HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS I THINK THAT IS THE APPROPRIATE APPROACH IS TO WORK WITH LOCAL RESOURCES IN TERMS OF COUNTY AS WE WORK ON THIS PROGRAM IN LOS ANGELES. WITH THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH SERVICES SO INDIVIDUALS LIKE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT SHOULDN'T BE IN THE PRISON SYSTEM AND ARE BETTER SERVED IN A COMMUNITY BASED SETTING WITH WRAPAROUND. COMPREHENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES TIED TO THEM IS A MUCH BETTER APPROACH AND WERE SEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL RESULTS IN THAT LOS ANGELES I'D BE HAPPY. TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU IN TERMS OF THE LIFERS WORK WITH A OR C. ON THAT PROGRAM AND SUPPORT THEM THERE ARE A A WONDERFUL ORGANIZATION I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT LIFERS WE ACTUALLY HIRE. A NUMBER OF FORMER LIFERS AN ORGANIZATION WE HAVE A FACILITY THAT'S ENTIRELY DEDICATED TO FORMER LIFERS THERE WE JUST OPEN IT THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS WHAT WORKED WITH US ON ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO. AND THAT'S A WONDERFUL PROGRAM AS YOU HEARD SECRETARY IDEAS SAY THE RETURN RATE FOR LIFERS IS ABOUT 3% BUT THE MARGIN OF ERROR. WITH SERVING LIFERS IS EVEN LESS THAN THAT SO WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL IN TERMS OF PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY. BUT THEY'RE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR WORK FORCE IN THEIR EIGHT EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL IN TERMS OF MENTORING A YOUNGER GENERATION OF PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING THROUGH THE SYSTEM NOW. ANY THAT SUPPORT AND THEN I'LL JUST SAY FINALLY BECAUSE OF COURSE I WAS IMPACTED BY PROGRAMS LIKE THAT. I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT FAMILY REUNIFICATION PROGRAMS I BELIEVE THERE'S A VERY SMALL ONE THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALLOWS FOR UP TO FIVE YEARS I BELIEVE -- WHILE THEY'RE STILL INCARCERATED I CAN'T THINK OF THE ACRONYM FOR RIGHT NOW YOU CAN FIND IT OUT LET ME KNOW AND THAT OUT AND I BELIEVE THERE'S ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THIRTY BEDS -- IN LA COUNTY I BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE OPERATING WITH ACTUALLY ALLOW WOMEN TO REUNITE WITH THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS BUT WOULD LOVE TO SEE MORE OF THOSE KIND OF PROGRAMS AND THEY HAVE PROGRAMS LIKE PHOTO. THAT ACTUALLY ALLOW WOMEN. TO I'M OUT ON ALTERNATIVE CUSTODY ANKLE MONITORS AND REUNITE WE ACTUALLY FUND THOSE PROGRAMS THERE ARE STOP SERVICES AND SHAUN DOES AS WELL. IN THE COST OF THAT IS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN BEING INCARCERATE YES AND THE IMPACT IS IMMEASURABLE IN SOME CASES LIKE I MENTIONED YOU KNOW THAT NOBODY EVER TRACKS WHAT THE TRUE COST IS TO A FAMILY. WITH THE TRUE IMPACT IS TO THE CHILDREN THAT ARE ACTUALLY BROUGHT THROUGH THOSE SERVICES AND WE ALWAYS FOCUS ON THE INDIVIDUAL THAT'S INCARCERATED WHICH IS GOOD. BUT THERE'S SO MANY -- INDIRECT RIPPLE EFFECTS OF IN TERMS OF PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES SUCCESSFULLY IN THE COMMUNITY. CAN I MAKE THAT YOUR DAD ON TO THE TO LIVE FOR PEACE THERE THOSE ARE THE MOST -- MOTIVATED INDIVIDUALS YOU'LL SEE THEY THEY KNOW THEY GOT THEIR ONE CHANCE THIS IS MY ONE SHOT AND I'M NOT GONNA MESS THIS UP THAT'S WHY THERE'S ALL. THE LOW RECIDIVISM RATE THAN THEIR SERIOUS -- THEY KNOW WHAT THEY WANT TO DO AND I THINK THE OUR PEACE BEEN VERY GOOD ABOUT ALLOWING LIFERS TO BE HIRED AND AND PUT INTO THE PROGRAM AND SO. THAT HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN A CHANGE IN THE IN THE NEW REGIME AND THEY'VE REALLY LOOKED AT THAT AND SAID. HEY WE CAN SEE THE SUCCESSFUL ELEMENT WE KNOW THAT THAT -- HAVE IN A MIXTURE OF PEOPLE WITH LIFE EXPERIENCE AND EDUCATION AND AND YOU BILL AND THOSE TWO TOGETHER YOU CAN GET SOME REALLY GOOD RESULTS. THE OTHER THING ON YOUR ON YOUR OTHER POPULATION THE ONLY I THINK THAT YOU'RE RIGHT THERE IS A PLACE FOR THEM AND IT CAN HAPPEN IN THE COMMUNITY WE JUST HAVE TO BE CAREFUL AND I SAY. THE RIGHT PROGRAM FOR THE RIGHT PERSON AT THE RIGHT TIME. BECAUSE WE CAN'T WELL WE DON'T WANT TO DO IS WE DON'T WANT TO JUST SAY. WELL WE'RE GONNA PUT THIS PERSON THAT'S ELDERLY THAT'S DIABETIC THAT'S YOU KNOW DYING INTO A REHABILITATION PROGRAM FOR DRUG AND ALCOHOL JUST SO WE CAN GET HIM OUT THERE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT BUILT FOR THAT THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT A SKILLED MILLER NURSING FACILITY THEY DON'T HAVE THE STAFFING FOR THAT. THEY THEY CAN'T -- MANAGED THAT POPULATION THERE THERE FOR MANAGING DIFFERENT POPULATION SO WE JUST HAVE TO LOOK FOR THE RIGHT PROGRAMS -- THAT FIT THAT POPULATION AND HOW DO WE HOW DO WE DO THOSE. THANK YOU. HI THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT WITH THAT WE WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT IF THERE IS ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. I'M I'M HELEN ROTH DELTON FROM SEIU LOCAL ONE THOUSAND WE REPRESENT THE WORKERS -- IN THE STATE FACILITIES THE TEACHERS IN THERE SOME OF THEM WITH ME. WHO'VE LISTEN TODAY AND I'M I'M PASSING OUT SOME RECOMMENDATIONS. THEY'RE NOT IT'S NOT JUST THE EVIDENCE BASED BUT THAT YOU NEED TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE PROGRAM COMPONENTS THAT ARE GOING INTO THAT. WE SUPPORT EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS OBVIOUSLY AND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET WE ALSO SUGGEST YOU LOOK AT ZERO WHICH PUTS OUT WROTE THESE REPORTS ON A LOT OF WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR IS ALREADY BEING DONE BY THE STATE AND SO WE WOULD WANT. TO USE RESOURCES WHEN THEY'RE ALREADY HERE AND SO LET ME TURN IT OVER BRIEFLY. TO THIS GENTLEMAN THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON COULD START WITH YOUR NAME AND MY NAME IS CHARLES THOMPSON I AM AN EDUCATOR AT PELICAN BAY STATE PRISON. AND I WAS LISTENING TO THE EVALUATIONS AND EVERYTHING TODAY. AND KIND OF CAME UP TO STAND UP FOR THE CREDENTIAL TEACHERS THAT ARE THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- OUR CHALLENGES ARE UNIQUE AND I WAS SITTING THERE THINKING IF I WAS AN INMATE. AND YOU GAVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO GOLD LISTEN TO ME TEACH HISTORY OR GET INTO A PROGRAM THAT'S PAYING ME A DOLLAR AN HOUR. AND GIVEN ME A TRADE. I'D BE TICKED. IF YOU WERE SITTING IN MY CLASS WHEREAS I'D BE EXCITED. TO BE LIKE IN A P. I. A PROGRAM. AND THE REASON I I KIND OF SAY THAT LIKE FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW -- I AM THE TUTOR FOR THE ELECTRONICS TEACHER. BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE THE TIME TO TEACH MATH AND SCIENCE AT THE SAME TIME TEACHING ELECTRONIC SO AS A VOCATIONAL TEACHER. MUST MY SCHEDULES A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBLE SO I CAN GO OVER THERE AND HELP TEACH THE MAD HELP KEEP THE SCIENCE. AND WHAT HAVE YOU. BUT IT ISN'T BECAUSE THE ACADEMIC TEACHERS -- DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES OR WHAT HAVE YOU IT'S JUST THAT THERE'S A SLIGHT DISCONNECT FOR EXAMPLE. THIS YOUNG MAN THAT I'M TEACHING IN THIS -- VOCATIONAL CLASS OR IN THE ELECTRONICS CLASS SHOULDN'T EVER BEEN CLASSIFIED TO BE IN THAT CLASS. IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO THERE'S A SLIGHT DISCONNECT BUT AT THE SAME TIME BE ACADEMICS ARE DOING I THINK A BANG UP JOB FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS I'M SURE THAT THE NEW DIRECTOR IS. SENDING US THE RESOURCES THAT WE NEED BUT AT THE SAME TIME I THINK THAT MAY BE. WHEN THEY DID THEIR OF STUDY WHATEVER I'D LIKE I'D I'D BE CURIOUS TO KNOW WHO THEY TALK? TO I REALLY WOULD BECAUSE I COULD HEAR. MISSISSAUGA ASKING OKAY. WHAT I GET THE WAGES I GET THAT THIS BUT HOW ARE YOU HELPING THESE GUYS WHAT ARE YOU DOING BEYOND THE WAGES? I THINK THE ACADEMIC OUTAGES AT PELICAN BAY ARE DOING THAT. AGAIN THERE'S SOME DISCONNECTS IN THERE AND EVERYTHING RIGHT THERE BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE PROGRAMS LIKE P. I. E. AND THE OTHER THINGS THAT THEY'RE WORKING WITH IT'S LIKE COMPARING APPLES AND ORANGES. I'M NOT SIT IN THE CLASS. MAKING NO MONEY. OR I CAN GO SIT OVER IN THIS CLASS. MAKE A DOLLAR AN HOUR. AND THEN I HEARD THEM SAY A 7% RECIDIVISM RATE. WHERE YOU GET THAT NUMBER IT? IS THIS SELF REPORTED. BECAUSE IF CDC ARE GAVE OUR RECIDIVISM RATES. MAYBE OUR NUMBERS WOULD LOOK PRETTY GOOD. TO SO NO OFFENSE TO ANYBODY ELSE BUT I THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS IS DOING A HELL OF A JOB. AND THE ACADEMIC TEACHERS THAT ARE ASSIGNED TO THESE PRISONS ARE DOING THE BEST WE CAN WITH WHAT WE HAVE. YEAH THANK YOU THANK YOU. PLEASE. GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS ROBERT HOLTZ -- I AM A CREDENTIALED CT INSTRUCTOR AT THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTION. FOR MEN I'VE BEEN A DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEE FOR THE PAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS I'VE WORKED UNDER.

IN THE COMMUNITY TAKE ON THEIR VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS TAKE ON SOME OF THESE CONTRACTED AND ENGAGE THEM IN THE PROCESS OF LOOKING AT HOLISTICALLY HOW ARE WE DOING. DELIVER IN A YOU KNOW AN EDUCATIONAL PRODUCT -- NO IT'S IT'S IT'S I SEE IT AS A A METHOD BY WHICH YOU'RE LOOKING TO SEE. OUR WE'VE BEEN EFFECTIVE WELL.

IN THREE DAYS I WILL OF SAVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. I WAS FORMERLY INCARCERATED WITH SIX LIFE SENTENCES CONSECUTIVE TO FORTY YEARS I HAD A HUNDRED NINETY TO LIVE.

I WAS ABLE TO BECOME THE FIRST EVER PRISONER OF TO RECEIVE A RECALL OF COMMITMENT UNDER ELEVEN SEVENTY D.. AND NOW I DEDICATE MY LIFE TO GOING BACK IN INSIDE. ALONG WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. THE ISSUE IS THAT THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. THAT WORK WITHIN CDC ARE. ARE ONLY ALLOTTED FOR MILLION DOLLARS FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS. THESE ARE THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE. PROVIDING TRAUMA INFORMED. PROGRAMMING. FOR GUYS THAT ARE SERVING LIFE AND LONG TERMS. THERE'S THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS GOING INTO THE C. B. TEAS AND FOUR MILLION DOLLARS GOING TO THE CBO THIS. THE CBO'S EDGE AS AS YOU HEARD YOURSELF THESE LIFERS ARE GOING BACK IN WITH A THREE AND A HALF PERCENT RECIDIVISM RATE. THE THERE'S THE MODEL FOR SUCCESS THE MODEL FOR SUCCESS IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF US. SOMEBODY THAT'S FORMALLY INCARCERATED SHOULD BE SITTING ON THIS PANEL SO THAT YOU CAN HEAR WHAT WORKED WHAT WHAT WORK FOR THESE GUYS THAT ARE THAT ARE NOT RECEIVING RIGHT.

FOR ALL TO SEE -- IN EXPOSITION PARK IN LOS ANGELES SO IF YOU. GIVE HER SOME INFORMATION THAT WOULD BE GREAT ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT. HI GOOD AFTERNOON OR GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS EARL SMITH I'M RETIRED CHAPLAIN FROM THE SAN QUENTIN PRISON WORKED THERE FOR TWENTY THREE YEARS I STARTED IN -- NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE WHEN I STARTED THE PRISON WAS LOCKED DOWN. AND I REALIZE THAT PROGRAMS ARE THE ONLY WAY THAT WE WOULD. BE ABLE TO TURN AROUND -- FAST FORD I STARTED THE PAINT SENATE WITH BASEBALL PROGRAM. THE REASON I START THEIR PROGRAM WAS BECAUSE I WANTED TO FIND A WAY TO TAKE ME IN. THAT WERE FROM DIFFERENT RACES DIFFERENT GANGS AND BRING THEM TOGETHER WITH SOMETHING IN COMMON. WHILE AT THE SAME TIME AS A PROTESTANT CHAPLAIN. I STARTED SOMETHING CALLED INCARCERATED MEAN PUTTING AWAY CHILDISH THINGS WHICH TOOK ME. FROM THE PROTESTANT CHAPEL THE MUSLIM CHAPEL THE JEWISH CHAPEL TO BUDDHIST CHAPEL THE NATIVE AMERICAN CHAPEL WE BROUGHT THEM ALL TOGETHER INTO A PROGRAM IS THAT WHAT WE HAVE IN COMMON. AND AS A RESULT OF THAT. GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS THE FIRST LIVE FOR THAT GOT OUT UNDER HIM. WAS A GUY THAT WAS IN OUR PROGRAM. THE GUYS THAT I HAD FIND THAT PROFOUND THE PROGRAM WITH. THEY WERE ALL LIFERS THEY'RE ALL OUT THERE ALL ALL PAROLES FOR THEIR SAVE THE STATE A LOT OF MONEY BECAUSE NOW THEY'RE HOMEOWNERS. OF THE REASON I STAND UP HERE IS BECAUSE I KNOW THE VALUE. OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WE SAY THE VOLUNTEERS BUT YET IN REALITY THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE HAVING FUNDING IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SEND PEOPLE ON TRIPS OR WHATEVER THEY HAVE TO GO INTO THE PRISON. SOME OF THESE PLACES A FOUR WAY THEY'RE NOT ALL LIKE SAN QUENTIN THE BAY AREA. AND IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT THEY NEED THE FUNDING AND THAT'S WITH A REALLY HERE FOR AND A CLOSE AND I LIKE TO SAY THIS. I HAVE A HOUSE FOR LIFERS I HAVE A HELL'S MY WIFE AND I WE HAVE AN ACRE WE HAVE SIXTEEN BED FACILITY. AND IS CENTERED AROUND THE PREMISE THAT GUY SHOULDN'T JUST GET OUT AND GO BACK TO SOMEPLACE. THEY SHOULD BE PREPARED TO GO BACK. AND IN DOING THAT WE'VE HAD SEVENTY EIGHT GUYS FROM DIFFERENT WHETHER THEY'RE LIFERS A LONG TERM RATES GET OUT. AND MY DAUGHTER JUST TEXT ME SOMETHING TO SAY FOR WHICH IT THING OKAY. SIXTY ONE OF THE GUYS GRADUATED SOME OF THEM WENT OTHER PLACES BUT THE REASON I'M SAYING THAT IS. I HEAR THIS THING WE TEACH PROGRAMS AND SET IN THE PRISONS RIGHT NOW ALSO LIKE A VOLUNTEER NOW THAT I'M RETIRED I TEACH THE PROGRAMS AND THERE NEEDS TO BE A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE GUYS WERE TEACHING IN THE PRISON. AND HOUSING IN PREPARING THEM. TO STAY IN THE COMMUNITY WITHOUT THAT THERE'S A DISCONNECT AND I BELIEVE THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE WHERE THAT CONNECTION COMES WE HAVE THE HOUSING WE DO ALL OF THAT BUT SOME OF THESE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS I COULD TELL YOU AS A CHAPLAIN. WITHOUT THEM I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL THANK YOU. THANK YOU YEAH I'M I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A HOLISTIC APPROACH. POLICE OFFICIAL PUBLIC COMMENT HI -- MY NAME IS AN ALONG ON WITH THE W. HAYWOOD BURNS INSTITUTE AND REALLY INTERESTING HEARING TODAY I JUST WANTED TO BUILD ON WHAT ON THE TWO GENTLEMAN BEFORE ME SAID BUT JOHN -- POINTED OUT SO THE NEED FOR FINDING AND I WOULD JUST ADD THAT AS YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK TODAY ABOUT THE NEED FOR BETTER EVALUATION MORE EXPANSIVE EVALUATION THAT. GOES BE ON C. B. T. AND ON YOU KNOW LOOKS AT OTHER MEASURES BESIDES RECIDIVISM BUT ALSO THAT THAT TAKES TIME IN YOUR LIFE YOU KNOW ALL THE DEPARTMENTS LOOKING FOR RESEARCH PARTNERS AND SO. AS YOU'RE BUILDING THAT EVALUATION DESIGN AND TRYING TO DISTINGUISH WHICH CBO'S ARE ACTUALLY CAUSING YOU KNOW A BETTER REDUCTION IN RECIDIVISM AND BETTER OUTCOMES. THAT THERE IS A NEED. TO INCREASE THE FUNDING THROUGH THE CDC OUR INNOVATION GRANTS THE WISHES OF FUNDS THAT THAT FIND A LOT OF THE COMMUNITIES BASED PROGRAMS. SO THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS LEFT. TO EVALUATE BECAUSE FOUR MILLION IN FUNDING YOU KNOW IS A REDUCTION IN WHAT THEY WERE GETTING AND SO I KNOW THERE'S BEEN AN ASKED. TO FOR TEN MILLION ADD ON AND YOU KNOW I THINK THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT. TO FIND SO IN ALSO THERE PROGRAMS LEFT OF VALUE -- EIGHT AND I THINK ALSO ENGAGING THE CBO'S IN THAT PROCESS AGAIN TO ASK THEM WHAT SHOULD BE MEASURED TO GET THEIR THINKING TO GET. PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN INSIDE AND DIRECTLY IMPACTED TO GET THEIR THINKING ON WHAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT IN CAUSING TRANSFORMATION AND SO IT ISN'T JUST YOU KNOW FROM THE IVORY TOWER AND SMART PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO DIRECT EXPERIENCE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT. I HI MY NAME'S AMANDA BURGER ON THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR WITH THE INSIDE CORDON PROGRAM AND WE WORK IN. NINE PRISONS IN CALIFORNIA TO JUVENILE FACILITIES IN INDIANA AND WE'RE ALSO WORKING AT EACH CLOSE WHICH IS A YOUTH FACILITY. IN STOCKTON OUR WORK IS SPENDING EVERYTHING FROM WOMEN'S FACILITIES TO HEALTH FACILITIES WE'RE WORKING WITH LIFE FAIRS. I PERSONALLY OF MANAGE THE PROGRAM ON EACH UNIT FOR THE LAST THREE AND A HALF YEARS AT SAN QUENTIN AND IN THAT CASE WE'RE WORKING WITH MEN WHO HAVE DETERMINATE SENTENCES. ON ALTHOUGH MANY PEOPLE THINK OF US AS A GARDENING PROGRAM WE ACTUALLY HAVING ECO LITERACY CURRICULUM WHERE MINDFULNESS BASED. WE CO DESIGN AND PLANT PERMACULTURE GARDENS AND WE DO RE ENTRY BRIDGING THIRTY OF THE MAN THAT WE WORK WITH ITS HAND CLINTON HAVE BEEN HIRED BY PLANTING JUSTICE WHICH IS A COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAM IN OAKLAND. AND WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO INCREASE OUR WORK IN IDENTIFYING WITH PEOPLE'S NEEDS ARE PRE RELEASE. BEFORE THEY GO HOME AND THEN CONNECTING THEM WITH TRUSTED PEOPLE IN COUNTIES WHERE WE HAVE. ALLIES AND I THERE'S JUST A FEW THINGS I WANTED TO SAY TODAY WE'RE ALSO A FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE TRANSFORMATIVE PRISON IN PRISON WORKING GROUP TEA PW. WHICH REPRESENTS THIRTY FIVE GROUPS THAT OFFER TRANSFORMATIVE PROGRAMMING IN PRISONS. AND JUST TO REITERATE WHAT SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING WE ARE ADVOCATING FOR TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO BE ALLOCATED TO OUR WORK. IN THIS BUDGET SESSION ON THE FOUR MILLION DOLLARS WAS A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR REDUCTION FROM TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN YOU DO THE MATH IT'S EASY TO SEE FOUR MILLION DOLLARS ACROSS THIRTY SIX PRISONS. IS VIRTUALLY IT'S JUST ENOUGH MONEY TO KEEP US ALIVE BUT NOT IN ANY KIND OF SUSTAINED WAY. AND I I REALLY DO WANT TO SAY TO YOU THE AUDITOR USED THE WORD VOLUNTEER OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN HER REPORT WE ARE NOT VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS WERE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE PROFESSIONALLY STAFFED. WHO THEN PARTNER WITH VOLUNTEERS IN THE COMMUNITY MANY OF US ALSO HIGHER FORMALLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE WITH YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AND PEOPLE NAY LIVING WAGES SO I JUST? I REALLY WANT TO ELIMINATE THAT TERM VOLUNTEER. FROM EVERYONE'S VOCABULARY ON THE LAST THING I WANTED TO SAY I APPRECIATED ALL THE DISCUSSION ABOUT EVIDENCE BASED RESEARCH TODAY. AND I JUST WANT TO SAY AGAIN WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS FROM A SYSTEMS APPROACH NOT ALL PRISONS OR PRISON YARDS ARE CREATED EQUALLY. AND SO I THINK WHILE WE'RE ALSO WE'RE LOOKING AT THE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAMS WE ALSO NEED TO REALLY HAVE A FOCUS ON WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS FOR SUCCESS ON THE YARD. ARMED AVENAL STATE PRISON IS A PRISON WE'RE WORKING AT TWO YARDS THERE THE WORKING CAME UP THROUGH EDUCATION -- CUSTODY SHE'S BEEN PHENOMENALLY SUPPORTIVE TO US AS A PROGRAM PROVIDER WE'RE ABLE TO GET. EMAIL RESPONSES CUSTODY ON THE YARD ARE VERY OPEN TO WORKING WITH US SO I JUST WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT SUCCESS. TO REALLY THINK BROADLY AROUND WHAT DOES DISTRICT DOES SUCCESS MEAN HOW DO YOU DEFINE SUCCESS IN NOT ONLY WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR IN OUR PROGRAMS. BUT WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS THAT NEED TO EXIST ON A YARD IN WITHIN A PRISON. FOR ALL OF US TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND FINALLY THE LAST THING I'LL SAY -- I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU SAW ON SIXTY MINUTES BUT THEY JUST. POSTED A VIDEO ON THE VERY INSTITUTE HAS A PROJECT CALLED HUMANIZING PRISONS THEY SPENT A LOT OF TIME GOING TO GERMANY AND STUDYING THE WAY THE PRISON SYSTEM IS FUNCTIONING THERE. AND THEY'VE NOW GOTTEN SOME FUNDING AND THEY'VE BEEN DOING WORKING CONNECTICUT IN REALLY TRANSFORMING THE CULTURE ON THE YARD AND FRANKLY THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING AT WHAT WE'RE DOING IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE TO THE CDC OURS CREDIT WE'VE INNOVATED WITH A LOT OF WORK HERE. SO AGAIN I I JUST REALLY WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO REALLY TH. TO KEEP ASKING THIS QUESTION WHAT DOES SUCCESS MEAN AND WHAT ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS THAT ARE GOING TO NEED TO COME TOGETHER. IN ORDER FOR THERE TO BE A REALLY SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION AND FOR PEOPLE TO GO HOME HEALTHY AND WHOLE. SO I WANT TO REALLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND APPRECIATED ALL THE NEW ONES CONVERSATION TODAY AND I KNOW IT'S LATE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THIS WILL PUBLIC COMMENT HOW YOU GUYS DOING MY NAME'S GERALD THE SAMA FORMALLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL WHO JUST COMPLETED HALF OF HIS LIFE AND CITY C. R.. SO I KNOW THE SYSTEM FROM. VOTE FOR IT AS AS A PART AS A PERSON YOU GUYS ARE TALKING ABOUT THE PEOPLE YOU GUYS ARE TALKING ABOUT. I SERVED IN -- I'M ALSO A CO FOUNDER OF OF AN ORGANIZATION CALLED SELF AWARENESS AND RECOVERY WAS STARTING TWO THOUSAND FIVE IN PRISON. TO ADDRESS TRAUMA TRAUMA THAT WASN'T BEING UP. ADDRESSED IN IN THE SYSTEM. YOU HAD MENTAL HOW YOU HAD THESE LITTLE GROUPS THAT WE REALLY. HITTING THE COR YOU KNOW WE M. AND I AND AND I'VE SEEN HOW WE'VE WASTED A LOT OF MONEY IN THE DEPARTMENT. OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE JUST LIKE MAN IT'S A COOKIE CUTTER NUMBER STATE A COOKIE CUTTER EVIDENCE BASED HOME. AND THEN THE PEOPLE THAT ARE BUSTING OUR **** BECAUSE MY LANGUAGE ARE YOU IN THE COMMUNITY -- THEY THE GOAL WINNER THAT THERE REALLY ARE MAKING A CONNECTION THERE COMING FROM A NON BIASED PERSPECTIVE THEY'RE COMING FROM AN EMPATHETIC PERSPECTIVE ARE CONNECTED WITH THE PEOPLE DOESN'T MAKE IN ARE THE PEOPLE THAT MAKING PROFOUND CHANGES. I PARTICIPATED IN OVER EASY ABOUT FORTY DIFFERENT. PROGRAMS FROM THE COMMUNITY. AND AND AND I SEEM THEIR STRUGGLES ICE IN THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY'D HAVE TO GO THROUGH GOING TO CLEAR TO GOING TO THE PRISON SYSTEM. THEY WENT TO A LOT I ALSO SERVED ON THE MAN'S ADVISORY COUNCIL FOR A LOT OF YEARS. IN THERE YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT WAS ESTABLISHED BY LEGISLATOR TO TO TO MEDIATE BETWEEN OFFICERS AND IN THE IN THE POPULATION OF ENCOUNTER A LOT OF RETALIATION AND FROM WHAT I WENT THROUGH. AND AND SERVING IN THERE BUT I HAVE I WOULD WITH OUR MINISTRY IS THERE ARE OUR WARDENS AND WE MADE A LOT OF POSITIVE -- CHANGES. A BIT INCOME WITH A LOT WHICH STRUGGLES IN SEOUL YOU KNOW I REALLY WANT WANT WANT US TO HAVE FORMALLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE AT THE TABLE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. HOW HOW WE'RE GONNA PUSH THIS THIS THIS THE? THIS PROBLEM THAT WE'RE ENCOUNTERING AND HOW HOW AND HOW WE HOW TO INVEST MONEY IN THE RIGHT PLACES NOW WHERE IS JUST THE COOKIE CUTTER MODEL AND IT AND IF YOU'RE NOT EVEN IS BASED IN. THE THEN YOU HAD A LOOK BECAUSE I SEE A LOT OF GREAT PEOPLE THAT ARE ARE COMING FROM THE COMMUNITY. TO HELP OUT THAT THE THE COMMUNITY INSIDE OF CITRIX PEOPLE FROM THE HOOD. BY THE HOOD TO HELP PEOPLE FROM THE HOOD. HERE I MEAN IN AND IF IF IT BELOW THAT THE SUPPORT. YOU KNOW IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO REALLY REACH OUT THE POPULATION THAT COMES FROM TRAUMA FROM ABUSE FROM THEY COLLECT FROM DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THESE SOME OF THE MOST HURT. INDIVIDUALS IN SEOUL THEY THEY NEED APPROACHES THAT THAT THAT THAT COME FROM A PLACE OF COMPASSION LOVE HEALING AND EMPATHY. AND ALSO WE NEED ASSISTANCE ON HOW TO LOVE AT THAT THAT DATA YOU KNOW -- TO THE SIDE WITH THERE'D BE TWO SOUNDS TO THEIR SYSTEM THAT THEY HAVE YOU KNOW WHAT WE GIVE EACH ILL TAG GROUP OR EACH ORGAN. ORGANIZATION THAT GOES ENTERED EVERYBODY'S AT A SUMMIT SERVICE A PRE AND POST SURVEY YOU GET THAT DATA AND YOU SEE THE DIFFERENCE OVER TIME. AND AND WE CREATE A SYSTEM STARLOG IN THE DATA FOR FOR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS YOU KNOW SOUL -- I I I I I HAVE KIND OF MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT ABOUT THIS WHOLE TOPIC BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE WE'RE WE'RE INVESTING TOO MUCH MONEY. AND THE RIGHT AND THE WRONG AREAS AND I DIDN'T IN THE RIGHT AREAS SO WHAT I'M I'M I'M BASICALLY JUST A REQUEST IN THIS THAT. WE PROVIDE MORE SUPPORT FOR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS NOVICE SOME SOME FUNDING THERE -- SO THAT OUR PEOPLE THAT COME FROM FROM FROM THE STREETS THAT ARE CONNECTING AND MAKE AN IMPACT IN THE CHANGES THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THERE WHO ARE INCARCERATED. IN PEOPLE THAT COME FROM THAT BACKGROUND. CAN'T CAN SUPPORT THEM WHO BETTER TO TELL A PERSON ABOUT RE ENTRY THAT THAN A PERSONAL CAME OUT AND WENT PLEASE REENTRY BUSES AND WENT ALL THE HURDLES. AND AND KNOWS THE THE REAL FROM THE FAKE OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT OFFER SERVICES FOR US YOU KNOW BECAUSE THAT'S HAVE. PEOPLE COME INTERNET TELL US WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU A B. C. AND D.

SO YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF GRAY AREAS THERE THAT THAT DEFINITELY BE WORKED OUT AND HOPEFULLY WE WE WE CAN ALL WORK TOGETHER I'M NOT HERE TO BASH ON THE DEPARTMENT. YOU KNOW BECAUSE IN THAT DEPARTMENT IT WAS WHAT I GOT THREE THREE THREE THREE VOCATIONAL TRADES I GOT. TO TWO COLLEGE DEGREES IN THERE YOU KNOW I AND A LOT OF WISDOM AND INSIGHT AND AND EXPANDED OUR PROGRAM IN OUR TOTAL NUMEROUS PUT -- PRISONS WITH NO FUNDING ON ILL TAG IT MAY LEISURE ACTIVITY FUNDING ACTUALLY THAT THAT THAT THAT IS THAT THAT THERE IS WILL SOME FUNNY SO WHAT LIVE VERY LIMITED FUNDING.

PUBLIC COMMENT TO WILL BE RESTRICTED TO ONE MINUTE EACH AND OUR STAFF WILL HOLD UP A GENTLE REMINDER WHEN. IT'S YOUR TIME TO CLOSE. WITH THAT LET'S BEGIN WITH ISSUE NUMBER ONE WELCOME COLLEAGUES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY ON THE IMPLEMENTATION AND FUNDING UPDATE RELATED TO THE CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM EFFORTS. ALSO CALLED THE C. C. R.. PLEASE ALSO COVER THE B. C. P. USE THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH C. C. R. [inaudible] THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF FEATURE BINGO WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR THERE -- I WANT TO GO AHEAD AND THANK YOUR STAFF THEY DID A VERY THOROUGH MULTI PAGE JOB DESCRIBING THE C. C. R. I'M GONNA RUN THROUGH IT VERY QUICKLY FOR REFERENCE WITH SOME HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS BUT I DON'T WANT TO TAKE. THE TIME TO READ IT BACK TO YOU EITHER. WONDERFUL -- THE C. C. R. THANK YOU FOR DEFINING THE ACRONYM -- RESULTED FROM LEGISLATION A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO THAT LED TO A MULTI YEAR ENGAGEMENT WITH STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. THAT EFFORT CULMINATED IN A JANUARY TWENTY FIFTEEN REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ACCOMPANIED WITH A JANUARY -- BUDGET PROPOSAL -- FROM FROM THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION HAD A MULTI YOUR VIEW ON A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT NEEDED TO BE DONE TO IMPROVE THE OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILY -- IN CALIFORNIA SPECIFICALLY AROUND CHILD WELFARE OF COURSE -- THE THERE WERE A VARIETY OF OF GOALS OF THE OF THAT WITHIN THAT BUT PRIMARILY AROUND THE REDUCING THE USE OF CONGREGATE CARE -- WE WE FOUND THAT WHILE OF COURSE THERE ARE GOOD CONGREGATE CARE PROVIDERS TO PRODUCE GOOD OUTCOMES BY AND LARGE THE ASSOCIATIONS THAT A DEMOGRAPHIC LEVEL -- ARE BETTER FOR USE WHEN THEY ARE IN HOME BASED FAMILY CARE SITUATIONS WITH IT WITH A A MORE LIMITED -- GROUP GROUP AROUND THEM -- THAT THEY CAN BE CARED FOR YOU OBVIOUSLY CAN'T JUST TAKE KIDS OUT OF A GROUP HOME YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME PLACE TO PUT THEM. SO THAT WAS THE REFLECTION IN THE INITIAL INVESTMENTS MADE IN THE C. C. R. IN TERMS OF FAMILY -- RECRUITMENT RETENTION AND SUPPORT. IN -- RE RE CASTING THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE VARIOUS FACILITY TYPES THAT WE HAVE. A MAKING SETTING THE EXPECTATION THAT GROUP HOMES WOULD BE PHASED OUT IN THE CHILD WELFARE ARENA IN FAVOR OF SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL THERAPEUTIC PROGRAMS -- I DON'T WANT TO USE THE WORD CRISIS STABILIZATION BUT THEY WERE ENVISIONED AS SIX MONTHS MAXIMUM PLACEMENTS AND LAST THOSE STRENGTHS AND NEEDS OF THE CHILD AND YOUTH INDICATED A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME WAS NEEDED. AND THAT REALLY THE FOCUS OF OUR EFFORT WAS TO GET HOME BASE FAMILY KERR -- WE HAVE GONE TO SINCE JANUARY TWENTY FIFTEEN THROUGH SEVERAL YEARS OF POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND GUIDANCE A LOT OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE -- WITH COUNTIES WITH PROVIDERS IN THE SYSTEM AND WE'VE BEEN MOVE NOW BEYOND THE JUST THE POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND INTO THE IMPLEMENTATION PHASE AND MORE NOW A COUPLE YEARS INTO THAT. AND YOU'LL SEE THAT REFLECTED IN THE IN THE FUNDING -- THAT THAT -- IS IS PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET AND HAS BEEN PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET -- IN ADDITION TO EFFORTS TO A RETAIN AND RECRUIT FAMILIES AND TO CHANGE THE THE MIX OF PROVIDER TYPES AND OUR SERVICE EXPECTATIONS OF THOSE PROVIDERS. A CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMING CONCEPTS WERE A MAJOR FEATURE OF THIS IT'S IMPORTANT. I THINK IT'S NO SECRET TO ANYBODY THAT WHEN PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THEM AND THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'VE HAD A VOICE AND BEEN ABLE TO BE HEARD THEY HAVE MORE BY INTO WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THEM. AND SO CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMING AROUND DECISIONS ABOUT PLACEMENT ABOUT SERVICE NEEDS -- ABOUT DURATION OF CARING OVERALL CASE MANAGEMENT AND WHAT'S IN A COURT REPORT THOSE ARE ALL FEATURES OF CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMING. EXCUSE ME SACRAMENTO ALLERGIES -- THE OTHER MAJOR FEATURE -- WELL IT WAS A DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW RATE SYSTEM FOR ABOUT TWENTY YEARS PRIOR TO THIS -- WE'VE HAD AN AGE BASED SYSTEM WHERE AS A CHILD GOT OLDER RATE RATES CHANGED -- WE'VE DOW IMPLEMENTED A RATE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S BASED ON THE SS STRENGTHS AND NEEDS OF THE CHILD. AND INTENDED TO BETTER SUPPORT FAMILIES -- ROUGHLY A HUNDRED AND TEN HUNDRED TWENTY DOLLAR A MONTH INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT GIVEN TO FAMILIES. A CHANGE IN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE PROVIDE FOR SERVICES AND ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT TO FOSTER FAMILY AGENCIES -- AND OTHER CHANGES -- TO FOR EXAMPLE THEY THE PHASE OUT OF THE GROUP HOME RATES AND REPLACEMENT WITH A SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT PROGRAM I'M GONNA TRY NOT TO CALL THEM S. T. R. T. P. S. -- AS DESCRIBED IN YOUR AGENDA THEY HAVE NEW RATES AS WELL -- THOSE THOSE ARE REALLY THE HIGHLIGHTS I WANTED TO HIT FOR YOU THERE WAS MAYBE ONE OTHER ON PAGE THIRTEEN THERE'S A MENTION OF ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND THAT'S BEEN A HUGE FOCUS FOR MANY YEARS IN CALIFORNIA EVEN DATING BEFORE THE C. C. R.. WE KNEW IT AS KATIE A LITIGATION KATIE. A WAS THE THE NAME OF THE YOUTH -- IN THAT LITIGATION -- AND WE'VE DONE AND MADE GREAT STRIDES IN CALIFORNIA INCREASING THE ABILITY OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN CARE TO ACCESS NECESSARY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AS I MENTIONED WHEN WE RE CAST THE EXPECTATIONS OF OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FEATURES PROMINENTLY AND NOT. AND THE SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT THERAPEUTIC PROGRAMS THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER HAVE MENTAL HEALTH CONTRACTS AS A AS A PRIMARY FOCUS OF THEIR SERVICE PREVENTION. IN TERMS OF FINDING YOUR CHART ON PAGE. SIXTEEN OF AT THE TOP THERE ARE LATE LAYS OUT THAT THE THE RECENT HISTORY AND A PROPOSAL -- FOR FOR C. C. R. YOU WILL NOTICE THE TOP FOUR LINES ALIGNED WITH THE MAJOR THEMES THAT I TALKED ABOUT THE THE THE RATE CARE -- PAYMENTS THE CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMS THE THE SUPPORT FOR FOSTER PARENT CARE GIVERS AND RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL WHAT WE USED TO CALL A FOSTER FAMILY HOME IS NOW KNOWN AS A RESOURCE -- FAMILY -- SO THAT'S A TERMINOLOGY CHANGE BUT THE CONCEPT IS THE SAME THOSE ARE THAT THE HOME BASED FAMILY KERR -- PROVIDERS CARE GIVERS THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS THAT ARE DISCUSSED IN YOUR AGENDA -- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CHANGE MANAGEMENT THAT'S BEEN DIFFICULT UNDERSTANDING ROLES AND EXPECTATIONS THE THE TRANSFER OF OF FAMILIES FROM A FOSTER FAMILY DESIGNATION TO A RESOURCE FAMILY DESIGNATION. HAS BEEN SLOWER N EVERYBODY ANTICIPATED -- THERE'S BEEN SOME INVESTMENTS AND BY THE LEGISLATURE AND AND THE LAST ADMINISTRATION IN THE CURRENT BUDGET TO GET -- THROUGH A BACKLOG TO APPROVE THOSE MORE TIMELY -- BUT THERE WAS A FUNDING AUGMENTATION MADE A COUPLE YEARS NOW -- THAT WE USED TO PAY -- FAMILY CARE GIVER WHEN THE CHILD I AM SORRY WHEN THEY HOME WAS APPROVED AS A PLACEMENT. BUT VERY OFTEN WE FIND PLACEMENT PRIOR TO APPROVAL AND SO THERE WAS A PERIOD OF TIME WHERE FAMILIES DIDN'T HAVE FINANCIAL SUPPORT THAT MAYBE WOULD HAVE HELPED THEM. EITHER BE A BETTER CARE GIVER OR BE WILLING TO ACCEPT A CHILD IN THE FIRST PLACE SO THAT'S A MAJOR INVESTMENT THE LEVEL OF CARE PROTOCOL TOOL HELPS US TO SIGN THE NEEDS BASE RATE TO A CHILD. CANS THE CHILD ASSESSMENT OF NEEDS AND STRENGTHS IS THE FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT WE'RE USING TO IDENTIFY THE NEEDSAND STRENGTHS OF THE YOUTH. AND THEN THERE ARE THE OTHER BUCKET WHICH I WON'T DESCRIBE BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY MANY THINGS LUMPED INTO THAT -- ON PAGE SEVENTEEN THERE'S A MENTION OF A COUPLE BCP'S. A BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS -- AT THE BOTTOM OF SEVENTEEN AND ON TO EIGHTEEN OTHER WAS RECENT LEGISLATION PASSED LAST YEAR -- AB TWENTY EIGHTY THREE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY -- THAT TALKED ABOUT INTEGRATED SYSTEMS OF CARE -- AND AND HOW WE GET EVERYBODY WHO NEEDS TO BE INVOLVED IN THE CARE OF A KID THERE'S OBVIOUSLY CROSSOVER A FOSTER YOUTH ISN'T JUST A FOSTER YOUTH THEY'RE ATTENDING SCHOOL THEY MAY HAVE. INVOLVEMENT WITH THE DISABILITY SYSTEM MENTAL HEALTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH -- WE HAVE YOU THROUGH OR DO ONLY INVOLVED WITH PROBATION SO MAKING SURE THAT EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS WHAT'S EXPECTED OF THEM AND MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE USE. IT WE'RE ASKING FOR STATE POSITIONS TO TO WORK ON THAT. AND THE SECOND ITEM ON THE TOP OF PAGE -- EIGHTEEN IS -- C. C. R. WAS CUT TITLE COMPLIANCE WORKLOAD BUT THESE THIRTY FOUR PEOPLE HAVE BEEN THE CORE OF OUR CC OUR IMPLEMENTATION TEAM AT THE DEPARTMENT WE'RE ASKING THEIR RENT -- IT RENEW ALL AN EXTENSION -- HERE THROUGH TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO RECOGNIZING THE PACE OF CCR HASN'T BEEN WHAT IT IS THESE ARE OUR RESIDENT EXPERTS PROVIDING ASSISTANCE AND MAKING SURE THAT THE WORK ACTUALLY GETS DONE. I WON'T DISCUSS THE ADVOCACY PROPOSALS BECAUSE WERE ARE OBVIOUSLY GOING TO GO THROUGH THEM IN THE NEXT COUPLE AGENDA ITEMS -- AND THERE'S A FEW PAGES STARTING ON PAGE TWENTY WHERE THE LA -- GOES THROUGH A NUMBER OF COMMENTS WE FOUND WHAT THE LA -- HAD TO SAY ABOUT CC ARE AT THIS POINT WAS VERY THOUGHTFUL AND FOCUSED ON WHAT IT TAKES TO BE SUCCESSFUL -- WE LARGELY AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS OF THE LA -- AND WILL HAVE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT LEVEL OF CARE IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS THAT WERE PROVIDED TO US IN THE AGENDA AHEAD OF TIME. A WITHOUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS OR I CAN -- TURN IT TO MY COLLEAGUE -- GREG ROSE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF OUR CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES DIVISION TO GO THROUGH THE QUESTIONS IN THE AGENDA. THANKS MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- GREG ROSE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF AND COUPLE OF THINGS I WANTED TO MENTION BEFORE ANSWER THE THE FIRST QUESTION. YEP YOU DIRECTOR TRIPPING CAN MENTION SOME OF THE THE THE THE SUCCESSES AND THE CHALLENGES OF OF C. C. R. I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE A COUPLE OF THINGS AS WELL. ONE AND WE'RE SEEING A DECLINE OF OVER A THOUSAND YOUNG PEOPLE IN CONGREGATE CARE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS -- THAT THEY'RE THE NUMBER OF CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMS IS INCREASING SIGNIFICANTLY BOTH ON CHILD WELFARE AND ON PROBATION MANAGE CASES WE'RE SEEING SOME SOMBER SOLID PARTNERSHIPS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT I THINK WILL BE -- THAT WILL BE FOUNDATIONAL TO CONTINUE TO MOVE THE THE SYSTEM FORWARD. AND AND THERE'S A LOT OF UPSTATE COLLABORATION WITH LOOK WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT ON THIS CASE SPECIFIC SITUATIONS -- SO THAT WE CAN BETTER CERTAIN THE WEEK WE CAN LEARN AND WE CAN ALSO BETTER SERVE YOUNG PEOPLE -- AND HELP THEM GET THE NEEDS THE THE THE THINGS THEY NEED. I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE A A COUPLE OF AREAS THAT WE I THINK ARE IMPORTANT WE FOCUS ON IN THIS -- THIS COMING YEAR AS WE DO IMPLEMENTATION ONE OF THOSE IS THERE'S THERE'S A AROUND EIGHT HUNDRED YOUNG PEOPLE IN -- CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES THAT -- ON MAY NOT OR ARE SOME MAY NOT AND SOME HAVE TOLD US THEY WILL NOT BE TRANSITIONING -- THE THE DAY THE COUNTIES ASSESSMENT OF THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE IN CARE IS ABOUT SEVENTY SOME ODD PERCENT REQUIREMENTS -- FOR FOR A SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL THERAPEUTIC PROGRAM AND SO IT TO THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE I THINK THAT WE WE WE AS A AS A AS A GROUP OF COLLEAGUES NEED TO FOCUS ON CLEARLY WE NEED. TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THE BACKLOG OF THE RFA APPLICATIONS AND THEIR AND AND I THINK THE THE THE KEY AS I THINK IS MENTIONED ACTUALLY IN THE AGENDA ONE OF THE CORNERSTONES OF THE AT OF THE OF THE INITIATIVE. IS HIGH QUALITY CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEIR AND PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT THEM HAVE BOYS AND CHOICE AND WE ARE SEAT WE'RE SEEING THE THE AS I MENTIONED WE'RE SEEING THE INCREASE OF THOSE -- WE ALSO ARE WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE WITH HIGH HIGH QUALITY AND WITH HIGH FIDELITY WITH THAT SAID I'M HAPPY -- TO TRANSITION INTO ACT ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE POSED INTO THE AGENDA. THE THE FIRST TWO QUESTIONS ARE ARE ARE SIMILAR IN NATURE AND AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR JAMAICA MENTIONED THAT -- THERE HAD BEEN SOME INVESTMENTS IN THESE AREAS OF THE THE SPECIFICALLY IS A QUESTION ABOUT -- ABOUT THE ELIMINATION AND I WOULD SAY THAT THE A COUPLE OF POINTS ONE THE THE COUNTIES HAVE HAD TO HAVE A PRIOR TO TO REALIGNMENT AND AND HAVE HAD SOME RESPONSIBILITY. TO DO -- APPROVALS AND THEY'VE HAD SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION. THE ADMINISTRATION CLEARLY KNEW GET GIVEN THE THE THAT HEAVY LEFT IN FRONT OF US. AND THE INTENT AND THE AND THE LEVEL OF INTENSITY NEEDED -- FOR TO TO DO RECRUITMENT RETENTION AND SUPPORT -- CREATED TO IN ESSENCE A THREE YEAR -- THAT A THREE THREE YEAR FUNDING TO PROVIDE -- THAT UP FRONT INVESTMENT IN IN THESE ACTIVITIES SO THE THE REDUCTION HAS BEEN THE REDUCTION IN THESE FUNDS IT HAS BEEN AT WHAT'S PLANNED -- WHEN WE HAVE FROM THE FIRST YEAR -- OF THAT ADDITIONAL -- ROLLOUT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION -- AND SO BOTH WITH THAT BOTH WITH THE THE SO CALLED SHIPPERS FUNDS THAT FOSTER PARENT RECRUITMENT RETENTION PONDS AND AND THE OUR FATE DOLLARS WERE INTENDED TO PROVIDE -- A SURGE OF ACTIVITY TO TO ALSO IDEA I I IDENTIFY AREAS THE OF IN FOR INNOVATION AT AND FUTURE -- REINVESTMENT BYE BYE COUNTIES -- WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO GO THROUGH ALL THE QUESTIONS OR YOU WANT US WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO STOP AFTER EACH. ONE DID YOU HAVE A COMMENT ISRAEL OKAY. I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT BEFORE WE CONTINUE -- YOU -- INDICATED THAT THERE IS A BACKLOG IN OUR FAVOR APPROVAL CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT THE BACKLOG IS OR HOW LONG IT'S TAKING I KNOW THERE WAS A DISCUSSION LAST YEAR AND WE WERE SUPPOSED TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO ADD. TO THE BACKLOG IS DECLINE IS DECLINING -- THE SPECIFIC NUMBERS I A CAN HAVE FOR YOU BEFORE THE END OF THE HEARING I DON'T HAVE THEM IT IN IN FRONT OF ME AT THE MO THEY'VE BEEN DEBT THERE'D. THEY'VE DECLINED BY -- AS I RECALL THE TWENTY SOME ODD PERCENT THE TIME TO APPROVAL IS STILL OPEN BUT IT'S STILL OVER NINETY DAYS SIGNIFICANTLY OVER NINETY DAYS. THE THE THE THE TREND IS THAT THE THE BACKLOG IS TRENDING DOWN AND THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS IS TRENDING UP. SO -- DEAD. SO AT THAT THE US THAT TIME FOR APPROVAL IS IS DECLINING BUT IT'S STILL IT'S STILL IN EXISTENCE I KNOW AND I IF I RECALL CORRECTLY LAST YEAR WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT -- MAKING SURE THAT THOSE APPLICATIONS WERE APPROVED IT WITHIN THE NINETY DAYS AND WE HAD ASSURANCES LAST YEAR THAT -- THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN AND SO THAT'S WHY I WANT TO KNOW SPECIFICALLY WHAT THE THE YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT'S TAKING AND WHY. SINCE LAST YEAR WE HAD THE DISCUSSION WHY HAS ANY CHANGE RIGHT AFTER THE PROMISES SO THAT SOME AT THE THERE ARE. FOUR ON THE PLACEMENTS PRIOR TO APPROVAL SO THESE WERE THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN RELATIVE CARE -- THE THE THEIR OF THE THE BACKLOG THE LAST I CHECKED WITH ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AND SET AND AND SIXTY SEVEN CASES. THE THEY ARE AND AND 61% OF THOSE CASES THAT ARE AT THAT ARE THAT ARE GOING ON BEYOND THE NINETY DAYS ARE -- ARE -- HAVE BEEN GRANTED GOOD COSTS OF THEIR THINGS THAT THE THE BOTH THE COUNTY AND THE CHECK AND THAT AND FAMILY ARE OF WITHOUT WITHOUT THEIR CONTROL SOME OF THEM HAPPENED TO DO WITH. THE LENGTH OF TIME RIGHT WHAT IT COST ME GOOD CAUSE MEANS THAT THAT THERE IS A THERE IS A A REASONABLE THERE'S ARE A REASONABLE REASON. FOR THAT FOR THAT FOR THAT THE THE TIME TO GO BEYOND NINETY DAYS SO FOR EXAMPLE SOME OF THOSE THINGS HAPPEN TO BE THE TIME IT TAKES TO GET A CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK COMPLETED. SOME OF THEM HAVE TO HAVE TO DO WITH SOME OF THAT WHICH IS THE THAT THAT ONE OF THE LARGER ONES AND SOME OF THEM HAVE TO DO WITH SOME -- PHYSICAL PLANT THINGS IN THE HOME. EXAMPLES ARE SOMETIMES IT HAS TO DO WITH -- SOMETIMES IT HAS TO DO WITH OF UP APPROPRIATE FENCING OR SOMETIMES IT HAS TO DO WITH -- WITH -- SMOKE DETECTORS AND OTHER KINDS OF THINGS BUT BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S THOSE KINDS OF PHYSICAL PLANT THINGS BY BUT AND YOU KNOW Y. ALLEY I THINK WE WERE HERE LAST YEAR WHEN WE HAD THESE CONVERSATIONS -- SMOKE DETECTORS ARE. TRIVIAL IN MY OPINION SEARCH LE IT'S LARGER THAT THAT THE THE THE THE WHOLE I DON'T HAVE MY LIST TO AND FROM THE I DO APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. THE THE THE THEY TEND TO IT THAT THAT HOME. THINGS HAPPEN TO BE THEY THEY'RE OFTEN. SO THEY'RE THEY'RE FLAUNTING WHAT THEY'RE ALSO THEY'RE ALSO SITUATIONS WHERE A FAMILY MOVED. TO SEND SOMEBODY TO GET THOSE LISTS FOR YOU SURE IN THE MEANTIME WHILE WE'RE HAVING THIS COME I EAT I WILL HI I HAVE SOME OF THE INFORMATION -- IN MY BACKPACK I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THERE ARE THERE ARE SITUATIONS IN WHICH FAMILIES WILL MOVE -- LIKE AT AT B. TIP TO HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER TO AS THEY'VE TAKEN ON THE YOUNG PERSON. AT MICH THROUGH THE APPROVAL AND THAT REQUIRES ANOTHER HOME AND GROUNDS INSPECTION SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF THERE'S A FEW THINGS LIKE THAT THAT THAT -- ARE AT THAT -- HAVE THAT THE CURRENT THERE'S A NUMBER SIX AS I SAID THAT. TIME TO APPROVAL PAST NINETY DAYS EVENTS ALL ITS ON THE MEANTIME I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT AT CHURCH TRYING TO HAVE A DIALOGUE HAD A FEW -- IN THE MEANTIME WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE KIDS THOSE KIDS ARE IN PLACEMENTS WITH THEIR RELATIVE. AT AT THAT POINT THERE THE RELATIVES ARE BEING REIMBURSED FOR THAT FOR THAT THERE OKAY SO WITH THAT WAS THAT THAT BIGELOW A DISCUSSION I ONE RELATED DISCUSSION INSTEAD OF AN ARGUMENT LAST YEAR. ABOUT HOW LONG IT WAS TAKING FOR THE OUR PAY. FOR THE FOR THE FAMILIES TO RECEIVE PAYMENT NOW SO THE FOLLOW UP QUESTION IS IS THERE A BACKLOG IN PAIN THOSE FAMILIES. NOT THAT WE'RE AWARE OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OKAY. ARE INEVITABLY I'M SURE THAT SOMEBODY COULD FIND A SITUATIONAL SOMEBODY I'M. SOMEBODY IS ONE THING BUT THE LIGHT IN GENERAL AS HE IS CLEAR THAT WE CAN PAY UP TO A YEAR OF PLACEMENT PRIOR TO APPROVAL OKAY SOLD MIKE IN SEOUL JUST TO BE CLEAR. SO FAMILIES ARE BEING PAID CREATES ARE IN THE HOMES IN THE MEAN AROUND IT'S JUST THE OFFICIAL APPROVAL HASN'T BEEN GRANTED CORRECT PLACEMENT PENDING APPROVAL. THE IMPROVE AS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN OUR OPINION BUT IT'S NOT DELAYING THE WELL BEING AND CARE OF THE CASE IS THAT ONCE AGAIN WHICH IS OUR FOR MISTER THAT WORKERS HERE THAT THAT WAS BOB BIG. DISCUSSION LAST YEAR OKAY AND THEN -- YOU SAID THERE'S SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN CASES. OF A CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THAT. THAT'S THE THE BACKLOG OF THE OF THE ROUTE THAT THE OF THE BEYOND THE NINETY DAYS SO THE MORE THE RELATIVE AND SIXTY SEVEN CASES. GIVE OR TAKE A FEW BRIGHT AND THE MAKE THE THE BAR. 99% OF THESE ARE OUR CHILDREN THAT ARE PLACED. CORRECT THE OF THAT THAT NUMBER I PROVIDE THEY'RE ALL PLACE THERE THAT THEY'RE ALL THEY ALL OUR RELATIVES WITH THAT ARE AT THAT HAVE CHILDREN IN THEIR CARE WHO ARE BEING COMPENSATED WHO GET THE STIPEND THE FOSTER CARE STIPEND FOR WHILE THAT WHILE THE WORK IS GOING THAT'S GREAT. NEWS BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS A BIG A TOPIC OF DISCUSSION AFTER A LOT OF THE FOLKS WERE HERE AND INDICATING THAT THERE WAS NO -- PAYMENT FOR THEM FOR IT RIGHT YOU TO FOUR MONTHS AND YOU KNOW SO THAT HAS BEEN COMPLETELY THAT ALL THAT PART HAS BEEN SOLVED BASED AS THE THE THE THE ACTUAL APPROVAL TIME. IS TAKING THE SOMETIME AT THE BASE AND THE FINAL CORRECT. OKAY CORRECTS OF FOLKS GET YOUR THAT WORKS ARE BEING SUPPORTED OKAY -- BUT STILL FOR THAT OKAY WERE YOU HAVING UP ARE VERY. THIS IS MY LEASE -- BUT NO I'M I'M REALLY THANKFUL THEN BECAUSE IT FEELS NOW THAT YOU ARE LISTENING -- WE HAD A BIG HUGE DISCUSSION LAST YEAR AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK BECAUSE AGAIN I THESE ARE KIDS THAT THAT NEED OUR SUPPORT AND FAMILIES IN NEED OUR SUPPORT SO IF YOU'RE GUARANTEEING ME THAT THIS IS HAPPENING. I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT IF YOU CAN JUST YOU KNOW GIVE ME THE A DVD OF THE DATA TO SUPPORT THAT I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT ABSOLUTELY WE CAN DO THAT -- WERE REPORTING ON C. C. R. IMPLEMENTATION PURSUANT TO SOME SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE THAT THE LEGISLATURE WAS JUST LAST MONTH WE GOT TOGETHER WITH YOUR STAFF AND WE PROVIDE A TWENTY SOME ODD PAGE REPORT THAT INCLUDES A CHART WITH THAT INFORMATION. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF YOU WOULD LIKE IT AS HE EXPLAINED -- THERE'S BEEN A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE VOLUME OF PEOPLE WANTING TO BE CARE GIVERS AND NEEDING TO MOVE THROUGH THE PIPELINE AT THE SAME TIME THAT'S HAPPENED. WE'VE MANAGED TO BRING THE BACKLOG DOWN AND I WHEN I SAY WE I MEAN US WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS -- TO BRING THAT THAT BACKLOG DOWN IT IS MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IN TIME TO APPROVAL IS MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT ALL OF THAT SAID AGAIN. CHILDREN ARE GETTING THE CARE THAT THEY NEED. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE AVERAGE IT'S PROBABLY IN THE WRITTEN WORD IS HUNDRED NINETY DAYS SITE. IT'S ABOUT SAY NOT BY. WILL DO NOW IS THAT WE'LL WHEN WE HEAR FROM. MEDINA -- FRANK JUSTIN RYAN -- AND THEN. PERHAPS HAVE SOME OF THE OTHER QUESTIONS YOUR ANSWERS ARE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THE DEAN OF COCOA. WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES GOOD AFTERNOON -- SPECIFICALLY I AM I'M. GOING TO BE ADDRESSING QUESTIONS FOUR AND FIVE AROUND SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES -- QUESTION NUMBER FOUR HOW DO THE DEPARTMENTS TRACK WHETHER MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. ARE BEING PROVIDED TO CHILDREN WHO NEED THOSE SERVICES WHETHER OR NOT IN AN S. T. R. T. PEER GROUP HOME -- AND THE TWO DEPARTMENTS -- DO PRODUCE QUARTERLY REPORTS THAT TRACK -- FOSTER CARE CHILDREN CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE WHO MAY NEED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE GETTING THOSE SERVICES. THE CHILD WELFARE IS REQUIRED -- TO SCREEN AND ALL CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE AND THEN MAKE A REFERRAL -- TO COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH -- IF THE CHILD SCREENS POSITIVE AND THEN THAT IS DOCUMENTED IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM AND THEN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. TAKES THAT DATA -- FROM THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM AND MATCHES IT TO OUR DATA TO DETERMINE WHAT SERVICES THE CHILDREN ARE GETTING -- IF IN FACT THEY'RE GETTING THE SERVICES. SO -- WE WE DO THAT MATCH WE DO IT QUARTERLY TO ENSURE THAT THE CHILDREN ARE GETTING THE SERVICE WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND TRACK THAT DATA. AND CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES -- TO EXAMINE AND REFINED THAT DATA NUMBER. FOUR AND BEFORE WE GET THE FIVE WHAT IS TODAY TO TELL ME ABOUT THE DELIVERY -- IT TELLS US THAT THE CHILDREN THAT ARE ACTUALLY MAKING IT INTO -- THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM MOST OF THOSE CHILDREN ARE RECIEVING SPECIAL TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. WHEN YOU SEE THOSE WHO MAKE IT YEAH? IT DOESN'T HELP OF MY MY MY MICROPHONE IS OFF FOR THOSE WHO WHO. YOU SAY FOR THOSE WHO MAKE AT THE END. WHAT DETERMINES OUR WHAT IS WHAT IS THE HOLD BACK FOR THOSE SO -- THERE IS SOME DATA COLLECTION AND I THINK SOME DATA IMPROVEMENT ISSUES -- THAT NEED TO HAPPEN WE ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SIDE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES -- CAN ONLY TRACK ONCE THE CHILD HAS MADE IT INTO THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM AND SEE IF THEY HAVE SERVICES SO PERHAPS I WILL. ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO SPEAK TO ON YOUR QUESTION. OKAY SURE REGRETS AGAIN FOR THE DEPARTMENT THE THE EIGHTY LIMITED THAT. EIGHTY POINT 3% OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO SCREEN POSITIVE GET REFERRED -- TO GET REFERRED OVER TO THE OVER TO TO THE MENTAL HEALTH ACT HIM SORRY. HAVE SCREENED -- GET IT GET A REFER SCREEN POSITIVE GET A REFERRAL INTO THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND THERE AND THERE'S A MEDICAL NECESSITY REQUIRE EVAN OUT OF MEDICAL NECESSITY ASSESSMENT THAT'S DONE. ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SIDE SO -- THE THE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT SCREEN POSITIVE -- OUT SO THERE'S A SCREENING AND THEN THERE'S AN ASSESSMENT TO THE CHILD WELFARE WORKER DOES A IN ESSENCE A ROUGH SAFETY IF YOU WILL THAT THE CHILD MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA -- HAD CERTAIN EXPERIENCES THEN THEY WILL -- THEY WILL BE REFERRED OVER TO THAT SPENT TO THE MENTAL HEALTH -- SPECIAL NOW PROGRAM SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM AT THAT POINT DOES A MORE CLINICAL ASSESSMENT TO SEE IF THE CHILD MEETS THE CRITERIA FOR MEDICAL NECESSITY. AND IT'S A THEN WENT THEN -- FOLKS WILL THEN THE SERVICES BEGAN BEYOND THAT SHOULD NOTE THAT THERE ARE YOU KNOW -- SOME SOME SOME FOLKS THAT HAVE SCREENED POSITIVE WILL NOT MEET THE MEDICAL NECESSITY REQUIREMENTS SO THAT STE THE THE ONLY SERVICE THEY WILL GET WILL BE AN ASSESSMENT. BECAUSE THEY THEY DON'T MEET THE CRITERIA FOR FURTHER -- FOR FURTHER SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH. WHEN WE HAVE FRANK MEGA I HAD A GERMAN JUST MAKE ONE COMMENT ON THIS PARTICULAR POINT IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH -- THAT WHAT WE DO KNOW FROM DATA AT THE H. C. S. IS THAT A ROUGHLY THREE IN TEN KIDS IN OUT OF HOME CARE. MEET THE ENGAGEMENT RATE WHICH IS A STATE THE TERM RATE -- THAT IS THE SORT OF THE METRIC OF MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT IN THE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM AND THAT MEANS FIVE CONTACTS IN A YEAR -- AND SO SEVEN IN TEN ARE NOT AND THAT'S IN PART BECAUSE AS MR ROSE SAID THAT. THE MEDICAL NECESSITY DEFINITION. AS IT'S APPLIED SCREENS SOME SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF KIDS IN OUT OF HOME CARE OUT OF THE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. AND TO SOME EXTENT IT'S GOOD FOR KIDS NOT GETTING SICK AND TO THE SCREENING IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT NOT TO HAVE THE MENTAL HEALTH CONVERSATION HERE BECAUSE THE BANK COMMITTEES. YOUR COMMITTEES HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AT SOME LENGTH ALL YEAR BUT THIS QUESTION OF WHAT IS MEDICAL NECESSITY. AND HOW IS IT HELPING ARE NOT HELPING KIDS TO EXPERIENCE THE TRAUMA OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT AND A REMOVAL -- I THINK IT'S A SIGNIFICANT ONE FOR THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE IT SEEMS COUNTERINTUITIVE AN INCONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT KIDS IN FOSTER CARE OF EXPERIENCED. THAT THINK THAT SEVEN OUT OF TEN OF THEM WOULD NOT. NEED ANY SUPPORT FROM OUR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH MEANINGFUL SUPPORT FROM OUR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. AND THE ISSUE THERE IS THE DEFINITION OF MEDICAL NECESSITY. IS THAT SOMETHING THEM I HOPE WE CAN WORK ON ON THAT. YES WONDERFUL AND CLEAN UP -- MISS COOK OFFS -- COULD YOU ADDRESS QUESTION NUMBER FIVE BEFORE WE MOVE ON SURE HAPPY TO SO QUESTION NUMBER -- FIVE REGARDING THE PROVISION OF SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND HOW IT IS PROGRESSING -- AND AREAS PERHAPS NEEDING ATTENTION -- WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS OR OR YEAR AND A THE PROVISION ESPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WE ARE SEEING IS PROGRESSING -- IT MAY VERY BY S. T. R. A. T. P. -- BUT BUT IT IS PROGRESSING -- AREAS OF WHERE -- I THINK THERE MIGHT BE SOME ATTENTION NEEDED IS PERHAPS ON THE LOWER LEVEL GROUP HOMES -- WHO ARE TRANSITIONING TO S. T. R. T. PEAS -- IN THAT THEY MAY HAVE NOT OR HAVE NOT DEALT WITH ON CHILDREN AND YOUTH -- WITH THESE INTENSIVE -- NEEDS AND ALSO -- MAY NOT BE FAMILIAR WITH THE SPECIAL TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND REQUIREMENTS AND THE WAY THAT -- SERVICES ARE EXPECTED TO BE PROVIDED -- AND SO IT'S A STEEP LEARNING CURVE ON FOR THEMSO I WOULD SAY THAT -- YOU KNOW THE DEPARTMENTS CONTINUE -- TO BRAINSTORM ON HOW WE CAN ASSIST SUPPORT -- THAT LEARNING CURVE WHAT IS IT YOU NEED. TO BE ABLE TO SHOW -- THE S. TRT PEAS. WHAT THEY NEED TO DO? IS SIX A STEEP LEARNING CURVE WHAT WHAT IS IT THEY NEED. I FOUND WHAT IS IT WE'RE GOING TO DO TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE IT. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SO THAT. WE DON'T LEAVE ANYBODY BEHIND -- I APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION -- THERE HAS BEEN A NUMBER OF EFFORTS STARTING FROM -- TRAINING -- A REGIONAL TRAININGS THAT HAPPENED SOME AT A HIGHER LEVEL BUT TO TRY TO INFORM IT'S BEEN GOING ON REGIONAL COOKIES BROUGHT THE LAST TWO YEARS TO EDUCATE -- S. T. R. T. PEAS OR GROUP -- GROUP HOMES LOOKING TO CONVERT THERE IS -- COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS THAT HAPPENED BETWEEN THE TWO DEPARTMENTS WHERE WILL ACTUALLY NEED -- WORK WITH -- GROUP HOMES THAT HAVE QUESTIONS -- I THERE IT IS COLLABORATIVE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN WITH THE PLACE IN AGENCIES AND THE MENTAL HEALTH PLAN SO I THINK THERE'S A NUMBER OF SUPPORTS. THE AT VARIOUS LEVELS THAT CAN HELP WITH THAT LEARNING CURVE. CLEARLY IT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. IN THE NEXT MONTH OR MONTHS AS% OPPOSED TO IN THE NEXT YEAR OR YEARS -- IS THERE A PLAN IS THEIR SPECIFIC PLAN TO TO DEAL WITH THIS [inaudible] TRANSITION PERIOD. I KNOW THAT YOU SAY THAT FOR TWO YEARS THERE'S BEEN SOME BRAINSTORMING BUT VERY SPECIFICALLY AND YOU FOR TRYING TO GET FROM POINT A TO POINT B.. IS THERE A PLAN SO THAT WE GET THERE. THE THE THE THE WAY THE THE LEAD THAT. THERE IS A PLAN THE PLAN THE IS BASED PARTLY BASED ON THE THE THE THE LEGISLATION WHICH COURT REQUIRES THIS KIND OF LINEAR PROCESS FIRST. FIRST YOU GET LICENSE TO IT WITH THE NEW UNDER THE NEW CRITERIA AND ADMITTEDLY ARE -- SCRUTON T. OF THE LICENSING PROCESS IN THE LICENSING DOCUMENT IS IS IS VERY HIGH FOR TWO REASONS ONE IS WE ARE LOOKING AT MAKING SURE THAT RATHER THAN -- IN OUR OLD WAY OF THE AUDITING WHERE WE KIND OF COUNTED ACCOUNTED THINGS AND ONLY LOOK AT MONEY WE WERE ACTUALLY TRYING TO ASSESS QUALITY AND SO PART OF WHAT WE ARE DOING IS. BEING CLEAR THAT. WE WOULD HOLD THE THE WE WOULD ASSESS THE THAT PROVIDERS OF QUALITY BASED ON WHAT THEY SAID THEY WERE. WHAT THE PROGRAM WAS GOING TO DO WHAT IS YOUR PROGRAM GOING TO BE HOW ARE THEY GOING TO FOCUS ON ON THAT THE HEALING THE TRAUMA HOW ARE THEY CONNECTED HOW ARE THEY HOW WILL THE IN? HOW WILL THE IMPLEMENTED PROVIDE THAT THE INTEGRATED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SO OUR OWN PROCESS TAKE IT IT TAKES A WHILE IT IT'S AN INTERNET PROCESS? ONLY THEN ONCE THEY'RE LICENSED CAN THEY GO OVER AND GET THE MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM APPROVAL THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS DOING -- AND SOME COUNTIES ARE DOING AS WELL AND THEN ONCE THEY HAVE HAVE GONE AND GOTTEN THAT PROGRAM APPROVAL THEN THEY'RE ABLE TO ENGAGE WITH LOCAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROGRAMS. TO ACTUALLY GET A CON GET CERTIFIED TO GET A CONTRACT SO IT'S A LINEAR PROCESS THAT IT TAKES A WHILE OUR PLAN TO GET PEOPLE -- FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER HE HAS BEEN A NUMBER OF REGIONAL CONVENING AND INCLUDING JUST RECENTLY A NUMBER OF OF OF WEBINARS AND OTHER ENGAGEMENT WHERE. SOME OF THAT THAT THE THE PROVIDERS THAT HAVE ALREADY GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS AND AND AND WE'RE AND TURNED THE CORNER MORE QUICKLY ARE ARE PROVIDING. HERE KIND OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BE IN ADDITION TO WHAT THE TWO DEPARTMENTS AND LOCAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IS DOING SOME COUNTIES ARE ALSO -- PARTNERING LOCALLY TOOK TO HELP SUPPORT -- THAT THAT THE PROVIDERS WHO HAVE YET WHO HAVE HISTORICALLY HAD A MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE AND HOW DO YOU PREPARE. SO THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY -- ACHIEVE THE PROGRAM APPROVAL SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF OF OF OF OF EFFORTS GOING -- BUT THE PROCESS IS IN FACT A LINEAR AND THEN AT THE END OF IT THE EVEN THE THE CONTRACTING PROCESS THAT LOCAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HAVE SELECTIVE CONTRACTING AND THEY THEY THEY CAN CHOOSE TO CONTRACT OR NOT TO CONTRACT WITH ANY GIVEN PROVIDER. IF IF I MAY MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE PITCHER FRANK AGAIN. I I WOULD JUST ADD ON TO THIS IS AN AREA WHERE I WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE DON'T UNDER STATE THE AMOUNT OF EFFORT GOING INTO THE WORK HERE -- THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF FACILITIES TRYING TO TRANSITION THE MALL IT IS A REALLY DIFFICULT UNDERTAKING -- WE ARE FOCUSED WITH OUR COUNTIES -- OUR STAFF AND AND SOME OF THE THIRTY FOUR IN THE B. C. P. THAT I REFERENCED EARLIER OR ENGAGE pCOLLEAGUES IN OUR COUNTY COLLEAGUES WE DO FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY INDIVIDUAL CALLS WITH THOSE COUNTIES. WE'RE WORKING THROUGH THE ISSUES THAT THEY'RE SEEING SPECIFICALLY COUNTY BY COUNTY ON THE GROUND WE'RE ALSO PRIORITIZING OUR EFFORT -- TO TO IDENTIFY WHERE WE NEED CAPACITY TO I'M KEY FOR YOU HOW MANY -- YOU SAID YOU YOU MAKE CALLS ARE YOU HAVE -- CALDERON COUNTIES HOW OFTEN -- SOME OF THOSE ARE WEEKLY DEPENDING ON THE COUNTY THAT OFTEN YEAH. A LARGE AMOUNT IS ARE OBVIOUSLY MORE OFTEN BECAUSE THEY HAVE MORE CASES TO WORK THROUGH MORE SITUATIONS TO WORK THROUGH THANK YOU YEAH ABSOLUTELY. SO I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH THE IMPRESSION THERE SOME VAGUE PLANNERS ACTIVE WORK THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT WORK THAT'S GOING ON ON A VERY INDIVIDUAL BASIS HERE AND MISTER MAC OF PERHAPS OR OTHERS MIGHT WANT TO WEIGH IN. WITH COMMENTS THERE THAT SAID THERE IS MORE THAT COULD BE DONE. YEAH. I JUST TOOK MY REMARKS OKAY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FRANK MAKE WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION -- A COLLEAGUE OF MINE AT SEATED BDA WHO'S HERE COLE WROTE THE REPORT. THAT GAVE RISE TO THE C. C. R. LEGISLATION WITH WITH MISTER ROSEN SO -- WE'RE FULLY COMMITTED TO ITS IMPLEMENTATION AND CONTINUE TO BELIEVE IT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO DO CHILD WELFARE SERVICES. I POINT OUT THAT THAT CCR ISN'T ONE REFORM CC ARE IS NO FEWER THAN FIVE MAJOR REFORMS THAT ARE ALL BEING UNDERTAKEN AT THE SAME TIME. WE'RE CHANGING THE WAY WE DO SOCIAL WORK WERE CHANGING THE NATURE OF RESIDENTIAL. CARE INTO INTO SHORT TERM TREATMENT WE'RE CHANGING THE WAY WE APPROVED FAMILIES WERE CHANGING THE LIGHT THE THE RATE SYSTEM FOR FAMILIES WERE CHANGING THE WAY AND THE NATURE -- BUT TWO OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND AND CHILD WELFARE AND ALL OF THIS IS HAPPENING AT THE SAME TIME. AND SO I WOULD JUST UNDERSCORE WHAT MR JOVANKA SAID THERE'S A LOT OF WORK HAPPENING. ALL THAT BEING SAID I DO THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO TAKE SOME STOCK AND HOW IT'S GOING WE MADE SOME BIG ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT. WITH C. C. R. WOULD BE ABLE TO PRODUCE AND BY WHEN AND I DO THINK THAT IT'S FAIR TO SAY. SERVE HOW THE GOING AND AS AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE AND AS WE SHOULD PROBABLY EXPECT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE GOING WELL. AND THERE ARE SOME AREAS THAT ARE STILL VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS AND PROBABLY GIVE RISE TO SOME REASON FOR SOME MID COURSE THINKING -- AND SO WE SORT OF A LINE WITH MR ROSE A SENSE OF OF WHAT'S WHAT'S WORKING THE REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF KIDS IN CONGREGATE CARE BOTH PROBATION AND CHILD WELFARE KIDS. CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMING IS A MUCH BETTER WAY OF DOING SOCIAL WORK FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED AND THAT'S WELL UNDER WAY THE RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL PROCESS. AS ARGUE WITH HIM LABOR INTENSIVE AS IT IS AND AT GET IT SO MUCH MORE WORK THAN WE ANTICIPATED TO GET THE EXISTING CASES SORT OF THROUGH THE PIPELINE. IT IS A MUCH BETTER WAY. TO APPROVE AND SUPPORT FAMILIES BECAUSE YOU DO A ROBUST HOME ASSESSMENT. AND SO CARE GIVERS. ARE BETTER ABLE TO CARE FOR CHILDREN WHERE BET BETTER ABLE TO DETERMINE IF IT'S A RIGHT MATCH SO I DON'T WANNA GET LOST IN THE DISCUSSION ABOUT OUR A FAIT. THE VALUE OF OF IT -- AS A DIFFERENT AND BETTER WAY OF APPROVING RELATIVES -- AND MANY FOSTER FAMILY AGENCIES ARE NOW STARTING TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF INTENSIVE SERVICES FOSTER CARE FAMILIES. THIS IS ONE OF TWO MAJOR CATEGORIES OF FAMILY BASED PLACEMENTS THAT CC ARE ASSUMED WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR KIDS WHO WERE IN LOWER LEVEL GROUP COMES BUT SHOULDN'T BE LIVING THERE. THEY DON'T THEY DON'T NEED TREATMENT BUT THEY SHOULD BE WITH FAMILIES AND WE MADE SOME ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT. BUILDING OUT INTENSIVE SERVICES FOSTER CARE AND TREATMENT FOSTER CARE WHAT WAS WHICH WAS ACTUALLY A REQUIREMENT OF THE KD ES SETTLEMENT. AN INTENSIVE SERVICES FOSTER CARE WE'RE STARTING TO SEE SORT OF TAKE OFF. THE AREAS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE STILL VERY MUCH A WORK AND AND AND PROCESS AND THERE ARE SOME AREAS OF CONCERN. ARE ONES THAT YOU'VE HIGHLIGHTED ALREADY ONE IS. THE RELATIVELY SLOW RATE OF CONVERSION OF GROUP HOMES -- INTO -- S. T. R. TEEPEES. ABOUT HALF OF THE KIDS WHO ARE IN CONGREGATE CARE ARE IN FILL IN FACILITIES RIGHT NOW THAT HAVE AN S. T. R. T. P. LICENSE. YOU PROVIDED THE AUTHORITY FOR US TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW THOSE FACILITIES TO CARE FOR THOSE CHILDREN. UNTIL THE END OF THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF THAT. SORT OF THAT THAT SLOWER RATE OF CONVERSION -- AND WE DO THINK THAT FOR MANY OF THOSE FACILITIES THEY'RE SMALLER FACILITIES THERE COMMUNITY BASED FACILITIES. MAY. THEY ARE QUALITY AND THEY COULD BE VERY THERAPEUTIC PLACES FOR YOU FOR YOU. BUT THE STEPS TO BE CALM APPROVED ARE NOT INSIGNIFICANT MISTER ROSE. OUTLINED SORT OF THE THREE THE THREE STEPS AND SO THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF WORK TO TRY TO HELP THOSE FACILITIES. ALONG THE PROCESS OF LICENSING AND APPROVAL AND THEN CONTRACTING. BUT I DO THINK IT IT'S TIME AND WE ARE BEGINNING TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. TO THINK ABOUT PERHAPS WHETHER WE NEED SOME MORE INTENSE SEVEN MORE INTENTIONAL. SORT OF SPECIFIC TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR THOSE. IN A FACILITY THAT WE REALLY BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE CARE NETWORK AND WE INTEND TO TALK TO THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT. IDEAS -- IDEAS FOR DOING JUST THAT -- THAT CONTRACTING -- THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH CONTRACTING ISSUE I THINK IT'S ONE THAT THAT BEARS KEEPING OUR EYE ON THERE'S ONLY NINETEEN S. T. R. T. PEAS IN THE STATE HAVE HAVE PASSED ALL THREE STEPS -- AND SO. THERE'S ABOUT NINE HUNDRED CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES IN THE STATE BUT I SHOULD QUALIFY THAT BY SAYING THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY TO SAY. THAT WE BELIEVE THERE OUGHT TO BE NINE HUNDRED BUT BUT NINETEEN IS A LOW NUMBER -- AND BOB AS WE GET S. T. R. T. PEAS THAT ARE IMPORTANT. THROUGH THE LICENSING PHASE I THINK WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO PROBLEM SOLVE. ABOUT HOW THOSE FACILITIES GET MENTAL HEALTH CONTRACTS FROM COUNTY MENTAL COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS AND THAT'S AN AREA I THINK THE BEARS. ARE OUR INTENTIONALITY AND YOUR AND AND YOUR OVERSIGHT -- AND THEN THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IS THEM AJ BUT THEY'RE PEDIC FOSTER CARE. WAS OF AN OUTCOME OF THE KD ES SETTLEMENT THE KATIE A LAWSUIT WITH THE LAWSUIT THAT THE STATE LOST -- THAT -- FOUND THAT THE STATE WAS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL EPA STT LAW. AND PART OF COMING INTO COMPLIANCE WITH WITH THE PST TO THE COURT REQUIRED WITH REST THAT DEVELOP TREATMENT FOSTER CARE. AND THAT'S BEEN VERY SLOW TO GET OFF THE GROUND AND AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S BECAUSE ANYONE'S BEEN DRAGGING THEIR FEET -- BUT WE MADE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TREATMENT FOSTER CARE WOULD BE A VIABLE. APPROACH -- TO TO SERVE SOME CHILDREN WHO SEE SEE OUR SAYS GET OUT OF THE GROUP HOPES. BOMB AND I THINK WE NEED TO WORK ON EITHER DEVELOPING TREATMENT FOSTER CARE WITH INTENTIONALITY OR COMING UP WITH A CONTINGENCY PLAN IF IT TURNS OUT THE TREATMENT FOSTER CARE TO IT. IT IS PERHAPS NOT VIABLE IN THE WAY THAT THAT KATIE A COURT -- THOUGHT IT WAS -- THE LAST AND LAST THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT -- THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS IT'S TAKEN MORE TIME. THAN PERHAPS SOME ORIGINALLY IMAGINED I SHOULD SAY PROBABLY NOT MORE TIME THAN MY MEMBERS IMAGINE -- BUT WE WERE INCREDIBLY AUDACIOUS IN SCOPE AN AMBITIOUS AND TIME FRAME. AND SO WE'LL TALK LATER ON IN THE PROPOSALS FOR INVESTMENT BUT OUR MEMBERS EXTREMELY ORRIED ABOUT PULLING OUT THE RUG. PULLING THE RUG OUT FROM UNDER THOSE UP FROM UP FROM UP FRONT INVESTMENTS LIKE RFA AND THE FAMILY STABILITY FUND BECAUSE THE FAMILY. ARE THE ALTERNATIVE -- TO GROUPON PLACEMENTS AND WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH OF THEM AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT I THINK THAT WE NOT. BECAUSE OF AN UNREALISTIC TIME FRAME THAT WE SET OUT AT THE BEGINNING BECAUSE WE WERE REALLY AUDACIOUS AN AMBITIOUS. THAT WE NOT PULLED THE RUG OUT FROM UNDER THE REFORM IN MID STREAM. WE'RE GOING TO BE SHARING THE CHAIR SHIP -- WE BOTH HAVE BILLS WE'RE PRESENTING. SO WE SINCERELY APPRECIATE YOUR UNDERSTANDING IN THAT REGARD -- ALL RIGHT. BEFORE THE FIFTY ABSOLUTELY YEAH SO SO BEFORE WE CONTINUE OUT WE TALKED ABOUT THE NINE HOT. NINE HUNDRED OF FACILITIES IN NINETEEN HAVE PASSED ALL THREE STEPS SOUL CAN YOU ELABORATE JUST A LITTLE BIT NOT TOO MUCH BUT I JUST WANT TO KNOW. IF THERE'S ONLY NINETEEN PASS DOES THAT MEAN THAT SOME KIDS ARE CURRENTLY IN THOSE FACILITIES. AND IF THERE IS ONLY NINETEEN AND HAVING FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. WHAT WHAT HAPPENS TO THE? THE I'M OF LET'S JUST ASSUME JUST FOR MY PURPOSES THAT THERE'S NOW IN NINETEEN COUNTY THAT ACTUALLY HAVE ONE RIGHT WHAT HAPPENS. TO THOSE OTHER COUNTIES OR THAT DON'T HAVE THOSE FACILITIES AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THOSE KIDS SO OF ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IN TWO PARTS THE FIRST PART OF YOUR QUESTION -- THE MENTAL HEALTH CONTRACT -- IS NOT A PREREQUISITE AT THIS MOMENT FOR A FACILITY TO CARE FOR A CHILD. THEY EITHER HAVE TO HAVE A CONTRACT TO DELIVER BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES OR THEY HAVE TO ENSURE THAT THEIR RANGING FOR ALL NECESSARY. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IT'S NOT THE OPTIMAL SORT OF STATE OF CCR OCT OPERATIONS BUT IT BUT IT IS ALLOWED -- BUT AS WE TO TEAR SECOND PARTY YOUR QUESTION -- THAT CC ARE INTENTIONALLY ENVISIONED REDUCING THE NUMBER OF CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES. AND YOUR QUESTION HITS TO A CONCERN THAT WE HAVE ONCE WE GET TO THE POINT WHERE. ALL THE FACILITIES QUALITY FACILITIES THAT CAN MEET THE TEST OF C. C. R. EXIST ARE THEY WHERE THE KIDS ARE. AND SO THERE ARE SOME REALLY EXCELLENT AS T. R. T. P. TH -- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IF YOU'RE NOT I MEAN IF YOU'RE NOT IN VENTURA COUNTY YOUR YOUR YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S IT'S YOUR AUTO COUNTY IF YOU'RE GONNA GO TO VICTOR. SO -- WE ARE LOOKING AT THIS QUESTION BUT I I DON'T I DON'T KNOW THAT. I CAN SIT HERE RIGHT NOW AND SAY WE'RE SURE THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A SUFFICIENT GEOGRAPHIC. SORT OF AVAILABILITY. OF TREATMENT PROGRAMS WHERE THE WHERE THE CHILDREN ARE RESIDING AND I KNOW WHAT'S ONE THING THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS CROSS MAPPING. BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO ACTIVELY MANAGE BYE BYE ON FOLLOW UP ON THE THE NOT SO THESE. NINETEEN HUNDRED FACILITIES THAT ARE POTENTIALLY GOING TO BE -- QUALIFIED ARE THE SEEN CHILDREN RIGHT NOW SOLE SO I GUESS MY MY QUESTION IS ARE THEIR KIDS CURRENTLY BEING SEEN. OKAY SO THAT THAT MAKES MORE SENSE THEY'RE NOT. EMPTY AND JUST WAITING FOR THE APPROVAL PART PROCESS ARE STILL SEEING CHILDREN BUT YOU HAVE A RACK SO. ALL OF THOSE FACILITIES HAVE -- HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE IN THEM SOME SOME ARE STILL MAINTAINING THEIR GROUP HOME LICENSE AND FOOD AND AND MEETING THOSE OUGHT THAT LEVEL OF CARE OBLIGATION. SOME ARE LICENSED AS AS SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT PROGRAMS BUT DON'T YET HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM SO THEY'RE AT THEIR MEETING THAT THAT THE HIGHER ACUITY NEEDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE BYE BYE -- BY ARRANGING FOR OR ARE PARTNERING WITH LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH TO ARRANGE FOR THAT THE SERVICES AND THEN NINETEEN ARE FULLY INTEGRATED ON THIS POINT. SO THERE THERE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE IS BEING SERVED IN THOSE THERE ARE A GROUP THE GROUP I MENTIONED EARLIER THE EIGHT HUNDRED OR SO THAT -- THAT WON'T MEET S. T. R. T. P. REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE IN SOME OF THAT -- BECAUSE THE CURRENT CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES THAT MAKE THAT HAVE TOLD US EITHER THEY'RE NOT GONNA TRANSITION OR IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THEY WILL ARE THE THAT GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE THE THE THE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WE AND THE DEPARTMENT ARE WORKING WITH OUR COUNTY COLLEAGUES. ON AT IMMEDIATELY TO LOCATE -- FAMILIES ARE ALL OF THAT CAN CARE FOR THEM IF IN JUST I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT MR ROSE SAID -- WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE IS THAT GOING FORWARD THOSE FACILITIES THAT ARE RECEIVING AND CARING FOR CHILDREN NOW WHO AREN'T FULLY LICENSED -- AT SOME POINT THEY HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION RIGHT TO CONTINUE IN THE LIMBO PERIOD OR DECIDE THIS IS NOT -- A SERVICE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO MEET. AND FOR THOSE THAT EITHER CAN'T OR DON'T WANT TO CONTINUE TO TO BE AN S. T. R. T. P.. IT'S IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT THEY NOT BECOME PART OF THE THE S. T. R. T. PEMEX BUT FOR THOSE. THAT CAN AND ARE NECESSARY AND COULD BE GOOD PROVIDERS WHAT WE DON'T WANT IS FOR THEM. TO GIVE UP AND SAID THIS IS THIS IS WAY TOO MANY HURDLES FOR US WE'RE OUT. AND AND IT'S IT'S THAT. I MEAN IN THE SHORT RUN THEY'RE THEY'RE CARING FOR AND SOME OF THEM ARE CARING FOR KIDS BUT AT SOME POINT. THEY HAVE TO DECIDE ARE WE GONNA CONTINUE IN THIS IT TO TO TRY TO DELIVER THE SERVICE ON BEHALF OF STATIC CALIFORNIA OR DO WE HAVE TO BACK OUT [inaudible] THANK YOU. IT ENDS IN DECEMBER. IS THAT CORRECT WHAT ENDS IN DEATH WHAT ENDS IN DECEMBER IS THE PERIOD AFTER DECEMBER ANY CHILD THAT IS IN -- A CONGREGATE CARE FACILITY THAT DOES NOT HAVE ITS S. T. R. T. P. LICENSE. IS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR STATE REIMBURSEMENT. SO IN FACT GIVEN THE GIVEN THE COST IT IT SORT OF MEANS THAT THAT PLACEMENT BECOMES. NOT A VIABLE PLACEMENT AND YOU EXTENDED. FROM THE YEAR BEFORE BACK TO DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST -- WITH CONDITIONS THAT I COUNTY COULD ASK FOR AN EXTENSION IF IT PROVED TO THE STATE. EXCUSE ME THAT IT WAS TAKING. APPROPRIATE STEPS TO TRY -- TO GET FAMILIES AND TO GET S. T. R. TO HELP GET US YOUR TEEPEES APPROVED. THE QUESTION THAT THAT OUR MEMBERS BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO ANSWER WITH YOU AND WITH THE ADMINISTRATION BEFORE THIS BUDGET AND IS DO WE THINK DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF NINETEEN CONTINUES TO BE A REASONABLE DATE. AND I BELIEVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS WILL START PROBABLY TOMORROW MORNING AROUND EIGHT O'CLOCK. CLEARLY THAT WOULD BE THE NEXT BEST A PARTY BUT NUMBER SAID SHE IS A BAR IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE THAT IT'S GOING TO BED THAT. ALL THE FACILITIES THAT THAT WE WANT BECAUSE THEY DELIVER GOOD CARE AND THEY CAN REALLY -- NEED A CHILD'S NEEDS TO HEAL -- IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THAT ALL OF THEM WILL WILL GET PAST THE FINISH LINE BY DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST. SO IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE REASONABLE TO EXPECT IT TO HAPPEN BY DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST. IT IS IT YOUR INTENTION THAN TO ASK FOR AN EXTENSION. TO ANY TO BEGIN THAT PROCESS. THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WERE ABOUT TO HAVE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION IS TO SORT OF IDENTIFY WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE A SORT OF A COMMON ASSESSMENT OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST BEING REASONABLE OR NOT AND AND IF IT TURNS OUT THAT MY SUPPOSITION HERE TODAY -- IS BORNE OUT IN THE ADMINISTRATION CAN KERR'S WE WOULD NEED A STATUTORY CHANGE TO ALLOW -- FOR EXCEPTIONS AND I ASSUME THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD WOULD WANT TO SIMILARLY. ENSURE THAT -- ANNEKE. IN THOSE CASES WERE EXTENSIONS OCCUR DUE DILIGENCE AS BEING MATT. AND TERMS OF FINDING FAMILIES AND AND BECAUSE IT'S NO ONE'S INTENT. TO HAVE AN INDEFINITE PERIOD OF YOU KNOW OF OF OF FACILITIES THAT ARE CONVERTED TO AS CHAIR TEEPEES DICK TO BE CONTINUED TO CARE FOR KIDS. BUT IF WE ONLY HAVE NINETEEN OF FIVE MILLION. NINE HUNDRED THAT'S WHAT THERE ARE. OTHER THERE ARE WORTH IT I'M SORRY EACH OF THOSE. HOMES EACH OF THOSE FACILITIES HAVE OUR YOUTH. THEY'VE GOT TO GO SOMEWHERE AND IF THERE ISN'T A FAMILY WE CAN'T PUT HIM ON THE STREET IT'S ABOUT HALF OF THE KIDS -- IN IN CONGREGATE CARE RIGHT NOW ARE IN A FACILITY THAT DOESN'T HAVE AN S. T. R. T. P. LICENSE. AS CHAIR TO BE LICENSE IS THE DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST THAT -- DEADLINE AND SO IT'S THE THE TEST WOULD BE FINDING FAMILIES FOR FOR THOSE CHILDREN OR END. OR BY GETTING THOSE FACILITIES TO THE POINT WHERE THEY ARE LICENSED AS S. T. R. T. PEAS. SO YOU CAN YOU ADDRESS YOU TACKLE THE PROBLEM FROM TWO DIRECTIONS FINDING FAMILIES IN TRYING TO HELP PUT FACILITIES. GET LICENSED AND WE'RE GONNA BE DOING BOTH AND THE QUESTION IS. OUR OUR MUTUAL EFFORTS IN THIS INVOLVES HELP FROM THE STATE. BOTH STATE AGENCIES AND OTHER COUNTY PARTNERS WELL OUR EFFORTS YIELD ENOUGH RESULTS SUCH THAT WE WOULD NOT NEED AN EXTENSION PAST TWELVE THIRTY ONE NINETEEN AND IT'S HARD FOR US TO IMAGINE. THAT THAT WOULD BE THE CASE THIS REVIEW YES. SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIND -- FOUGHT THE PARENTS BUT I MAY BE OFF ON THIS BUT IF YOU LOOK BACK ON PAGE SIXTEEN THE I CC ARE SPENDING UNDER TWENTY NINETEEN GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. IT LOOKS LIKE THE FOSTER PARENT RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION AND SUPPORT IS DECLINED. WITH ACTUALLY ZERO SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO FIND THESE FAMILIES WHEN. IT INDICATES THAT WE HAVE. ZERO MONEY TO FOR RECRUITMENT I IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY. UNLESS I'M WE ARE WE THINK THAT FUND IS REALLY IMPORTANT THE DIP THE DEPARTMENT IS IS. BRINGING CONTRACTORS LIKE DANNY'S GOODMAN TO HELP US WITH TECHNOLOGIES TO FIND FAMILIES BUT IT'S EXPENSIVE LABOR INTENSIVE ACTIVITY. AND SO FROM FROM THE VERY STRONG VIEWPOINT TO THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. IT IS PREMATURE TO REDUCE FUNDING FOR THE FAMILY STABILITY FUND FORMALLY KNOWN AS FIFTY SOUGHT NOT JUST PAYMENT CHAIR IT'S I'M IT'S CLEARLY GOING IT HUNTER PRODUCTIVE ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE IF YOU'RE SAYING THAT IN ORDER TO COMPLY. WE ARE TO HELP THESE KIDS OUT OF CC ARE ARE OUT OF THE I'M SORRY THE THE HOMES WE NEED FAMILIES BUT WE ARE NOT RECRUITING FAMILIES THERE WERE JUST. WE'RE GOING TO BE SPINNING OUR WHEELS ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST IT'S WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE. AND UP. IT'S AN ADDITIONAL COMMENT BY SO WE HAVE TO HOW CAN WE FIX THIS OR IS VERY PLAN. SINCE THE MONEY IS. ARE. NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE RECRUITMENT AND HOW CAN WE HELP. AND WE WE WE BROUGHT THE ISSUE TO FOR YOUR DISCUSSION HERE TODAY WE WE DEFINITELY INTEND TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO TRY TO GET TO OF A PLACE WHERE WE ALL AGREE. IS THE RIGHT PLACE AND IT WOULD RESULT IT IT IT. ASSUMING A STATUTORY CHANGES NEEDED WE ABSOLUTELY INTEND TO BRING IT TO THE BUDGET COMMITTEES -- FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU TESTIMONY FROM THE NEXT WITNESS [inaudible] JUSTIN. IT. DOESN'T REDUCE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- A IS THERE A SPECIFIC QUESTION THAT YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE ON WHAT -- CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR JAMAICA AND TO BE DIRECTOR ROSE HAVE EXPENDED ON FOR ME THE MOST. BUT NUMBER AND THE MANY THAT'S BEEN REDUCE I MEAN IS IS THAT SOMETHING THAT HAS EVEN BEEN DISCUSSED -- I UNDERSTAND IT'S A NEW ADMINISTRATION BY THIS IS A PRESSING ISSUE AND FOR VARYING OUT THE RECRUITMENT MONEY HAS THERE BEEN ANY DISCUSSION AS TO REINSTATING SOME OF THAT MONEY OR HOW WE'RE GOING TO HELP -- THE THE COUNTIES IN THE RECRUITMENT [inaudible] THROUGH A WHAT I CAN SEE IS THAT THE THE ADMIN AT THE KERN ADMINISTRATION AND MAINTAIN THE SAME PROPOSAL THAT DAY THAT. WAS ORIGINALLY AGREED UPON BY THE LEGISLATURE AND AND THE PAST RESTORATION WHEN -- CCR WAS ENVISIONED SO -- WHICH I THINK A CLEAR DISTINCTION HERE'S MAKE IS THAT THERE'S NOT A REDUCTION AND AT WHAT WE WE'VE BEEN REFERRING TO AS VAPERS OUR FOSTER PARENT RECRUITMENT RETENTION SUPPORT FUNDING -- RECRUITMENT PROCESS SO IT ENDS UP BECOMING A COUNTY RESPONSIBILITY IN AS DEPUTY DIRECTOR ROSE SAID COMMENTED ON EARLIER. THE THE DISCUSSION OF OF CCR AND RECOGNIZING THAT WE NEEDED TO MOVE THE SITE AT THE GROUP HOME POPULATION FROM THE CONGREGATE CARE. TO THE HOME BASED SETTING I WAS LOOK AT THAT THERE IS IT'S AN INITIAL INVESTMENTS -- SO ACT AS YOU READ THIS TIME THE ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T HAVE A PROPOSAL BEYOND'S MAINTAINING THAT SARAH THAT ORIGINAL INITIAL UP FRONT INVESTMENT NOW TO THE EXTENT. THAT A THIS IS A LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY -- AS USUAL WERE VERY HAPPY. TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS AND PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WERE RECOUNT ON THAT'S BUT WHAT KNOWN BUT LET ME JUST STOP YOU RIGHT THERE BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE WHAT I'M WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT THERE IS AN INITIAL INVESTMENT BUT ACCORDING TO THIS CHART IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE INITIAL INVESTMENT WAS -- TWENTY ONE THOUSAND IT'S TWENTY ONE SIX THIRTY BOB BUT THERE IS NO THE MAIN. MAINTAINING THAT ORIGINAL INVESTMENT BECAUSE IT'S IT'S THE IF YOU LOOK ABOUT CHARLIE YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE CORRECT WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. IS -- FOR THE CURRENT YEAR THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN MAINTAINING -- THE THE TWENTY ONE MILLION GENERAL FUND AND THEN PROPOSED FOR THE GOVERNOR AND THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THERE IS NOT A PROPOSAL. TO MAINTAIN OR AT ANY ENTITLED THAT THAT IS NOT MAINTAINING THE ORIGINAL INVESTMENT IT'S AS WELL AS WHERE I'M GETTING HUNG UP ON BECAUSE HE SAID THAT THERE IS AN INTENT TO MAINTAIN THE ORIGINAL INVESTMENT. AND BUYS HEARING IT OUT IS NOT MAINTAINING IN MY UNDERSTANDING IT. UNDERSTANDING IT NO I UNDERSTAND YOUR YOUR YOUR QUESTION AND THE ORIGINAL INVESTMENTS WAS THIS THREE YEAR PERIOD OF TIME -- AGAIN JUST A TO RESET AGAIN ADD TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS IS A PRIORITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE WE'RE HAPPY TO HELP. ALSO IN THAT CONVERSATION IS IS TO SHOULDN'T IT BE ARE ALSO A PRIORITY OF THE OF THE ADMINISTRATION I MEAN I THINK WE YOU KNOW THE SO I APPRECIATE. THAT YOU'RE HERE BY BUT IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS A PRIORITY FOR ALL OF US WHICH WAS INDICATED BY MAINTAINING THE ORIGINAL INVESTMENT THAN. THAT THE ORIGINAL INVESTMENT INDICATED TO ME THAT THERE WAS A PRIORITY FROM THE ADMINISTRATION I I I KNOW WE'RE GONNA BE GOING BACK AND FORTH BUT THE POINT BEING. THAT YOU'RE PUTTING IT BACK ON US I WHICH I CAN APPRECIATE HOWEVER THE THE THE ORIGINAL INVESTMENT INDICATED THAT THERE WERE SOME WILLINGNESS FROM THAT THE ADMINISTRATION TO CONTINUE WITH THIS. CELL. EIGHT I DON'T SEE THE I'M. THE INTENT. I GUESS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION TO CONTINUE YOUR YOU KEEP INDICATING THAT IF THERE'S AN INTENT FROM THE LEGISLATURE. THAN THAN -- THAN THE ADMINISTRATION WILL COMPLY BUT THE NICHOLS CAUGHT UP BACK TO WHAT YOU ORIGINALLY SAID THAT. THEY WERE MAINTAINING THE ORIGINAL INVESTMENT THE IN IT JUST THERE THERE'S NO INTENT ISN'T WHAT MY QUESTION IS ARE MY POINT IS. BY THE NINE INVESTMENT THIS TIME. AND MADAME CHAIRS -- THE FROM THIS FROM THIS THAT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE COUNTIES THAT ARE THAT ARE IMPLEMENTING THIS REFORM ON YOUR BEHALF WE ASSUMED A LOT OF THINGS THREE YEARS AGO. SO IT MAY BE TRUE THAT THREE YEARS AGO WE ASSUMED THAT WE WOULD HAVE ALL THE FAMILIES WE NEEDED -- WE ASSUMED THAT ALL THE S. T. R. T. PIECE WOULD HAVE CONVERTED. THE KD ES COURT ASSUME WE HAVE TREATMENT FOSTER CARE WE ASSUMED A LOT OF THINGS SOME OF THEM HAPPENED AND SOME OF THEM DID NOT AND SO. IT SEEMS I WOULD ASK THE ADMINISTRATION THAT INHERITED CC ARE FROM THE PRIOR% ADMINISTRATION TO UNDERSTAND THAT -- WE'RE ALL IN GOOD FAITH MAKING MID COURSE CORRECTIONS AND WORKING AS HARD AS WE POSSIBLY CAN TO IMPLEMENT THIS REFORM SOME THINGS ARE GOING AS PLANNED AND SOME THINGS AREN'T. SO TO SAY WELL THREE YEARS AGO WE THOUGHT IT WAS ALL GOING TO BE DONE AND IT'S NOT SO IF YOU WANT TO DO IT AFTER THREE YEARS IT'S ON YOU BUT THAT'S NOT OUR PRIORITY. I DON'T THINK THAT THAT IS AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO VIEW OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO IMPLEMENT CURRENT LAW BECAUSE CCAR'S CURRENT LAW. AND IF WE'RE ALL TOGETHER MAKING A GOOD FAITH MID COURSE CORRECTIONS AND ASSESSMENT OF HOW WELL WE'RE DOING. THEN WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE SAME ADJUSTMENTS ON THE FINANCING SIDE. I THINK THAT THE THE BOTTOM LINE IS. ARE THESE REDUCTIONS GOING TO HELP OR HURT C. C. R.. AND I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL HURT IT I MEAN I ASSUME WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THE REDUCTIONS WILL HURT IT. I THINK THAT THE THE IF WE TALK ABOUT PRIORITIES IT ISN'T LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY ONLY I THINK IT HAS TO BE A MUTUAL PRIORITY. AND I THINK IF WE VIEW IT THAT WAY JUST AS YOU SAID WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. ARE WE WE WE END. WE HAVE TO AT TIMES TAKE A REFRESHED LOOK. AT ANY VALUATION AS OPPOSED TO SAYING THIS IS WHAT WE DECIDED ON AND THAT'S IT. EVERY YEAR I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS AGAIN AND YOU'RE RIGHT WE'RE ALL TRYING TO DO. THE ABSOLUTE BEST THAT WE CAN WILL HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF RESPONSIBILITY DIFFERENT LEVELS OF EXPERTISE TO BE ABLE TO OFFER MORE TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WE DO IN THE END. WILL HELP US TAKE CARE OF THAT SUIT THE C. C. R.. IT HELPS TO TO REACH THE THE THE GOALS THAT WE WANT FROM THE C. C. OURS THIS WAS ONE OF ONE ADDITIONAL COMMENT MISTER FOR THIS -- I SAT HERE FIVE FOR TWO YEARS UNDER ALL GOVERNOR BROWN AND I KEEP GETTING -- THE SAME KIND OF STANDARD ANSWERS -- FROM YOU KNOW THAT ADMINISTRATION ABOUT YOU KNOW WILL HELP YOU WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND ALL OF THAT WHICH IS REALLY FRUSTRATING AND I SAW THIS GOVERNOR. OUT WITHOUT A FRESH NEW LOOK WITH HOPE WITH -- MORE ENCOURAGEMENT THAT WE WERE GOING TO TRULY BE PARTNERS IN THIS AND SOLD IF YOU. I DON'T MEAN TO I AM BE BRASH. ABOUT THIS BUT I THOUGHT WE WERE PARTNERS IN THIS AND AND AGAIN FOR ME IT WAS HOPEFUL TO HEAR THE GOVERNOR INDICATE THAT WE WERE ALL GOING TO BE IN THIS TOGETHER AND SOUL. SOUL I'M DON'T WANNA SEEM FRUSTRATED BUT I'M GOING TO GET FRUSTRATED WHEN I KEEP HEARING THE SAME YOU KNOW WHAT OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND WHICH IS REALLY DOESN'T DO ANYTHING I DON'T WANT TO START OUR RELATIONSHIP -- THAT WAY I WANT US TO REALLY SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT SOLUTIONS AND RATHER THAN TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND YOU KNOW ALL THE RHETORIC. FRANKLY THAT I GOT FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS FROM THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION I WAS REALLY HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN GET DIFFERENT ANSWERS BECAUSE THIS IS CHILDREN THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND SO I WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT BUT PLEASE. YOU KNOW FROM NOW ON THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR THE I GOT THE LIP SERVICE ALREADY FROM THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION AND I DON'T WANT. TO GET IT HERE. THESE ARE TWO CRITICAL -- IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH TO GET THE SAME LIP SERVICE AND I AGAIN MY HOPE IS THAT THIS NEW ADMINISTRATION WE CAN GET ANSWERS AND IT'S NOT PUNITIVE IN ANY MEANS I JUST WANT SOME -- WILLINGNESS TO TO SIT DOWN AND REALLY BE PARTNERS IN THIS INSTEAD OF YOU KNOW GETTING THE LIP SERVICE SO I WOULD APPRECIATE IT THAT IT IN THE FUTURE. I I WE CAN WE LIMIT THE YOU KNOW TECHNICAL ASSISTANT. RESPONSES BECAUSE THAT'S NOT HELPFUL WE NEED ACTUAL -- ANSWERS THAT ARE GOING TO HELP US IN DECEMBER YOU KNOW BY DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TO MAKE THIS A SOLUTION I'M NOT HERE -- TO BATTLE WE'RE HERE. TO I HAVE SOLUTIONS AND CREATE PATHWAYS SO THAT WE CAN ASSIST THE COUNTIES AND ASSIST THESE CHILDREN AND AND AND THE SERVICES THAT WE IN OUR PROMISING [inaudible] THANK YOU. SO I I I DON'T THINK THAT THE THE APPROACH OF THE MINISTRATION IS TO TO TAKE THIS AS YOU SAID THIS COMBAT EVER NOT BE SUPPORTIVE I THINK THAT'S WHEN THE BEAUTIES OF THIS BUDGET PROCESS RIGHT IN THE IN THE HEARINGS THAT WE GO THROUGH IS. THE ADMINISTRATION PUTS ON ITS BUDGET PROPOSAL IN AND AND THERE IS LISTED THE PRIORITIES AT THE TIME AND WE HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY HERE SO I'M DEFINITELY HERE ON ON YOUR CONCERN ON ON THE THE COMMENTS AND DONATED THINK THAT IT'S ANYTHING LIKE THAT OF OF A OF A LIP. SERVICE IT'S IT DOES COME FROM A GENUINE -- RESPONSE OF IF THIS IS A PRIOR TO THE TIME WHEN I OR INTO BEING ONE WERE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF IT CREDITS DISTANCE -- BECAUSE TAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE HERE TO SIT FOR AN A LIST AND YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S ALSO HERE. YOUR PRIORITIES SO I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND BUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU MS RUBIO -- RYAN THE LAND IS HELLO. GOOD AFTERNOON SHARED MEMBERS MILLINERS ILIO -- SO WE WOULD JUST LIKE TO REITERATE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE RAISED IN OUR HUMAN SERVICES BUDGET PUBLICATION -- RECENTLY -- TWO PRIMARY ISSUES -- ONE BEING. THE RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL IMPLEMENTATION AS HAS BEEN ALREADY NOTED -- THIS IS CRITICAL FOR THE BECAUSE OF THE SUCCESS OF THE GOALS OF CCAR SPONSORED THE GUIDE TO MAKING SURE THAT MORE. CHILDREN ARE IN HOME BASE FAMILY CARE SETTINGS -- AND AS AS ALSO PREVIOUSLY NOTED -- YOU KNOW THERE ARE THE REMAIN CHALLENGES RELATED -- TO THE APPLICATION APPROVAL TIME. A TIME FRAMES THAT -- FAMILIES HAVE TO GO THROUGH -- INCLUDING -- FOR CAREGIVERS WITH THE PLACEMENT PRIOR TO APPROVAL -- OVER NINETY DAYS AS REQUIRED -- BY LAW. AND SO GIVEN THESE CHALLENGES DESPITE THE FACT THAT THERE HAS BEEN SOME MODERATE -- IMPROVEMENTS IN THE WAIT TIMES. WE WOULD RECOMMEND NOT ONLY THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONTINUE TO CLOSELY MONITOR -- THIS PARTICULAR COMPONENT OF CCIR BUT CONSIDER EXTENDING. THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT THAT IT HAS BEEN GIVING TO COUNTIES. TO HELP THEM. IMPLEMENT THIS CRITICAL COMPONENT OF CCAR -- A AND AND BRING THOSE WAIT TIMES DOWN. AS WELL TO CONSIDER -- EXTENDING THE FUNDING FOR THESE PARTICULAR CARE GIVERS WITH THE PLACEMENT PRIOR TO APPROVAL -- OR HAVING THEIR WELL A APPROVAL WAIT TIMES. GREATER THAN NINETY DAYS -- IN ORDER TO INSURE THAT THESE ARE FAMILIES PLACEMENT SETTINGS ARE REMAIN STABLE AND THAT CHILDREN DON'T HAVE -- TO AND UP. OF CHANGING -- THERE CARE GIVERS OF THE OTHER -- IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT -- IS READ THE CARD TO THE LEVEL OF CARE -- TOOL AND RATE STRUCTURE -- THERE REMAIN SEVERAL OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS RATHER REGARDING THIS COMPONENT OF CCIR -- THAT IS ALSO EXPERIENCED -- SIGNIFICANT DELAYS -- ONE BEING -- WHAT THE? KIND OF THE LATEST ITERATION OF THAT TO LOOKS LIKE -- AND WHAT CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE. OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS -- INCORPORATING THE INPUT FROM THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN WORKING WITH -- WITH GARDEN THIS TOOL AND WHAT. ANY OUTSTANDING UNCERTAINTIES. REMAIN -- AS THE TOOL -- IS ROLLED OUT TO OTHER. POPULATIONS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE STRUCTURE -- WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT -- IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET A BOOK FROM VERY SPECIFIC DETAIL TIMELINE FOR THE ROLL OUT OF THE RATE STRUCTURE -- TO DIFFERENT -- CAREGIVERS OUTSIDE OF THE THE NEW -- FFA -- CARE GIVERS. AND THE DETAILS ON THE PLANNED VALIDITY TEST. THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PLANS -- TO CONDUCT ON THE TOOL AS IT'S ROLLED OUT AND HOW IT PLANS TO INCORPORATE -- ANY FINDINGS FROM THAT A TEST -- TO LATER ITERATIONS OF THE TOOL -- AND FINALLY TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE -- IT YOU WE THINK IT WOULD BE A WORTHY IF OF THE NEGOTIATION COULD -- OF PROVIDE A KIND OF AN ASSESSMENT OF THE COMBINED THAT FINANCIAL IMPACT THAT -- FOSTER FAMILY HOMES -- WOULD HAVE WHAT'S THE NEW RATE STRUCTURE IS IMPLEMENTED -- COMBINED WITH THE NEW -- SUPPLEMENTAL CARE INCLEMENT PLANS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL TO DETERMINE. WHETHER OR NOT THERE MIGHT MAYBE SOME FAMILIES THAT ON THAT HAVE A HIGHER OR LOWER -- RATE OF OF GRANTS COMPARED -- TO THEIR X. WHAT THEY WORKS WOULD HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING UNDER THE THE OLDER AGE BASED RATE STRUCTURE. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE LA -- BEFORE REMOVED TO THE NEXT. ISSUE. ALRIGHT THEN I'D LIKE TO ASK THAT -- JENNIFER REX ROAD -- COME JOIN US PLEASE. AND WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL [inaudible] THIS REYES. MR FRAZIER HAS AN EXCUSED ABSENCE MISTER MATHIS. MISTER PATTERSON. MISTER RAMOS MISS RUBIO. MEET DOCTOR WOULD [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME -- GENEREX READ WHAT CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE OF CARE GIVERS. AND EXCITE IT'S EXCITING TO BE A PAIR WITH I AM SUCH A HOT ISSUE THAT -- YOU'VE EXPRESSED INTEREST IN. AND I'D DEFINITELY WE FEEL THAT AND THIS IS NOT THE TIME. TO PULL THE RUG OUT -- FROM UNDERNEATH RETENTION AND RECRUITMENT ACTIVITIES. SO MANY COUNTIES HAVE DEVELOPED. I'M REALLY IMPORTANT AND SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS -- INCLUDING AND FAMILY FINDING ACTIVITIES AND CAMPAIGNS -- THERE ARE A LOT OF SUPPORT GROUP AT TANGIBLE SUPPORT AT PROGRAMS FOR CARE GIVERS INCLUDING. A MENTORING PROGRAMS -- FOSTER PARENT LIAISONS -- RESPITE PROGRAMS AND OTHER TANGIBLE SERVICES THAT MAKE -- PLACEMENTS POSSIBLE WHERE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE BEFORE INCLUDING -- SIBLING SETS AND OR LARGER SIBLING FATS AND AND OTHER YOUTH WHO ARE STEPPING DOWN FROM CONGREGATE CARE. SO WE REALLY FEEL LIKE -- THE TIME THAT THAT FIT BIRDS WAS IMPLEMENTED KIND OF GOT SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS OFF THE GROUND. UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF THAT MONEY WAS DIVERTED -- THROUGH THE WHOLE RFA CRISIS WHICH WAS IMPORTANT BUT NOT REALLY. THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE FUNDING SO SOME OF THE COUNTY IS WE'RE NOT ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THE RETENTION AND RECRUITMENT PROGRAMS THEM THAT THEY WOULD HAVE -- HAD THEY OTHERWISE NOT HAD TO DETER FOR DIVERT THE FUNDING. SO AB AND WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE AN COUNTY IS BE ABLE TO BUILD ON THE SUCCESS -- OF THESE PROGRAMS AND OTHER COUNTIES YOU KNOW START. THE SIXTH START DOING SUCCESSFUL ACTIVITIES ARE ACTIVITIES THAT SHOWED -- PROMISE OUR SUCCESS. AND AND SO WE CAN REALLY MEET THAT DEMAND FOR HOMES BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T STEP KIDS DOWN. UNLESS WE HAVE FAMILY HOME SETTINGS TO PUT THAT MEANT THANK YOU -- REACTION PLEASE FROM -- FEEDBACK FROM THE ADMINISTRATION -- DEAL F. AND ALEJO. WELL I THINK REALLY BRIEFLY A MEMBER TALKED ABOUT RECRUITMENT IN THE END IN THE PRIOR CONVERSATION WE JUST HAD I MEAN I I WOULD SAY. TO I MEAN IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW TO AS YOUR AGENDA DESCRIBED IN THE BACKGROUND WE DIDN'T GO THROUGH ABOUT THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM THAT SIGNIFICANT FUNDING FOR CHILD WELFARE WAS REALIGNED IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN AND ALONG WITH THAT CAME THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR FAMILY RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION. THAT SAID WE ALSO RECOGNIZE CHANGE IS HARD CHANGES DIFFICULT WE NEED MORE FAMILIES THAT'S WHY THE STATE INVESTED IN THE SYSTEM IN THE FIRST PLACE. WE'RE HAPPY AS MS RACKS ROAD AND MISTER MAC OF BEFORE HER -- AND YOUR OWN REQUEST FOR CONVERSATION WE'RE HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN THAT CONVERSATION ME WHAT I DIDN'T JUMP IN AND SAY AT THE TIME. JANUARY TEN WAS RIGHT AFTER JANUARY SIX AND THERE WHILE THE GOVERNOR WEIGHED IN ON PRIORITIES HE DIDN'T HAVE PRIORITIES ON EVERY ISSUE IN THE BUDGET RIGHT. AND SO I'M GONNA. SAY WITHOUT SAYING WHAT I JUST SAID. AND YOU KNOW WE'RE HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND YOU KNOW -- WONDERFUL THANK YOU. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE. I THINK MAYBE THE IF I MAY THE ONLY OTHER THING THAT I WOULD ADD TO THIS IS THAT -- AS WE'VE SEEN WITH OTHER INVESTMENTS LIKE THE RFA BACKLOG REDUCTION. WHEN WE PUT MONEY INTO SOMETHING BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE SHOULD ALSO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT WE EXPECT TO GET OUT OF THAT INVESTMENT OR WHAT THE PROGRESS OR MILESTONES ARE THAT WE'RE EXPECTING AND SO I WOULD JUST ADD THAT TO THE CONVERSATION? THIS ISSUE AGAIN DOESN'T HAPPEN IN ISOLATION MR ROSE TESTIFIED WE'D ALREADY REDUCED A THOUSAND KIDS OUT OF CONGREGATE CARE. MEANING THOSE OF ALREADY GONE SOME PLACE WE HAVE AN RFA -- BACKLOG IN A DELAY IN APPROVALS. ADDRESSING THAT CAN CREATE MORE HOME BASED CARE PLACEMENTS AND FURTHER REDUCING THE NEED FOR SOME OF THE FACILITIES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT. IT'S A LOT OF WORK A LOT OF DIFFERENT MOVING PARTS AND PIECES WERE HAPPY TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION SO FOR SHEER INDULGENCE. AND JUST IN CASE MY BRAIN IT'S AN AND JUST TO ADD ON WITH THE TO BE DIRECTOR TO MAKE IT SAID THE THE THE GOVERNOR HAS MADE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN ITS FIRST BUDGET IN HHS SO -- BEGIN TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS IS A PRIORITY -- WILL HAPPEN GAUGING THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND JUST RECOGNIZE. THAT YOU KNOW ALL OF ALL OF THESE SERVERS AS WE TAKE FROM ONE TO ANOTHER THOSE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE ALSO WANT TO CONSIDER AS WELL. THANK YOU -- THAT WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT POTENTIAL UNSPENT FUNDS. A AND F. P. R. R. S.. CAN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE COUNTIES IN THE ADVOCATES SPEAK TO THIS. AND HOW IT RELATES TO THE PROPOSAL. I THINK I THINK THERE ARE AND IN SOME CASES SOME OF THE CONTRACTS AND SERVICES WERE DELAYED IN THE BEGINNING I WAS ABLE. THERE WAS SOME LAG TIME -- IN SETTING OUT PROGRAMS AND GETTING THE CONTRACTS IN PLACE. AND I THINK WHAT I'VE SEEN AS THAT AND BECAUSE COUNTIES NEIL THAT THE PROGRAM -- OR THE FUNDING WAS ENDING THEY STARTED THEY SUCH AN SOME COUNTY IT'S A STARTED TO SCALE BACK -- THE PROGRAMS AND FUNDING -- SO. THAT'S THE BEST I CAN. OFFER. GREG MAY KNOW MORE. LAUREN HUNTER. RIGHT SO I JUST I WITHOUT GREAT RISK IN THE DEPARTMENT I'D ALSO NOTE THAT PREVIOUS YEARS OF UNSPENT FUNDS HAVE BEEN ROLLED OVER AND AVAILABLE THIS YEAR AS WELL SO THE THE THE THE INVESTMENT THE THREE YEAR INVESTMENT THAT WE TALKED SO MUCH ABOUT EARLIER. HE HAS HAS CARRIED THROUGH YOU KNOW IT SO IT HAS IT HAS BEEN AVAILABLE -- AND SO I WANT YOU. TO SO WOULD YOU ASKED ABOUT THE AND YOU KNOW UNSPENT FUNDS THEY THEY ARE THEY ARE AVAILABLE THIS YEAR [inaudible] AND I'LL ADD ONE MORE AND PEACE TO THAT I KNOW OF A PROGRAM AND FOR LA PROBATION FOR EXAMPLE THEY'RE USING. AND A VERY -- HIGH QUALITY EVIDENCE BASED MARKETING AND RECRUITMENT -- PROGRAM AND THEY'RE GETTING A LOT OF RESULTS SO. THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK MAYBE TOOK A LITTLE WHILE TO GET OFF THE GROUND BUT NOW THEY HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED. AND THEY HAVE KIND OF HAVE THIS WAVE OF SUCCESS WHEREAS IF THE PROGRAM. IF THE IF THE FUNDING DOES THAT CONTINUE YOU HAVE A LOT OF INTERESTED. PARTY IS AN A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM GOING BUT NO -- NO WAY TO CONTINUE TO KIND OF CAPTURE AND TRAIN AND AND UC'S FAMILY IS FOR PROBATION YOUTH. SO THAT MIGHT BE AN EXAMPLE OF OF HOW THIS. THIS INVESTMENT IF WE IF WE CUT IT OFF RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOSING YOU KNOW WHERE IT CAN A LOSING THAT. THREE YEAR INVESTMENT. CUTE BUT WHEN FINANCE NO COMMENT. BUT I I THINK AGAIN JUST AND REYES FINANCE I THINK WE'VE WE'VE CONTINUED ON WITH THE DISCUSSION AND IT'S AT RESPECT FOR NOT PROVIDING THE SAME RESPONSE -- JUST TO GET OUT ON WITH THAT W. DIRECTOR ROSE SAID WE'VE -- INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL WAS LANGUAGE TO RE APPROPRIATE ANY UNSPENT FUNDS THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY. TO PROVIDED TO COUNTIES FOR ANY OF THOSE UNSPENT FUNDS TO GIVE THEM A LONGER TO USE THOSE -- GOOD [inaudible] HELLO. COMMENTS VERY GOOD. THANK YOU -- ADVOCACY PROPOSAL THE FAMILY URGENT RESPONSE SYSTEM FERS. CAN WE CALL UP CAN DEREK APRIL [inaudible] GREAT. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I CAN'T BEGIN TO TELL YOU HOW HAPPY I AM TO BE HERE TODAY -- MY NAME'S KEN BERWICK I'M THE FOUNDER AND CEO OF SENECA FAMILY OF AGENCIES WHERE ONE OF THOSE NINETEEN STI TEEPEES IN THE STATE. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WERE ONE OF THE LARGEST WRAPAROUND PROVIDERS IN THE STATE. AND WE PROVIDE SERVICES ACROSS CHILD WELFARE MENTAL HEALTH JUVENILE JUSTICE AND EDUCATION IN INTEGRATED SYSTEMS. TO THAT END AND BECAUSE OF THAT WORK WE'VE SEEN UP CLOSE. THE IMPACTS OF SOME OF THE GAPS IN OUR SERVICE SYSTEM FOR KIDS AND FAMILIES. AND SEEING THOSE GAPS THREE YEARS AGO WE GOT A GRANT FROM THE IRVINE FOUNDATION. TO BRING LEADERS IN THE STATE TOGETHER TO LOOK AT HI NEEDS YOU. AND THE SAY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT COULD BE MOST IMPACTFUL FOR THOSE WHO. AND AND THROUGH THAT PROCESS WHAT WE SAW IS THAT YOUTH ARE ENDING UP. IN HOSPITALS. IN JUVENILE HALLS. AND HOMELESS. THAT NEVER NEEDED TO BE. AND THEY DIDN'T NEED TO BE BECAUSE THERE ARE MOMENTS IN THOSE WHOSE LIFE AND THEIR FAMILIES LIVE. WHERE WE CAN OPTIONALLY INTERVENE USING A MOBILE CRISIS RESPONSE SYSTEM THAT CAN CHANGE THEIR TRAJECTORY? THE TRUTH IS I DON'T THINK WE KNOW HOW MANY S. T. R. T. P. BETS WE NEED IN THE STATE. I DON'T THINK WE KNOW HOW MANY FOSTER VETS WE NEED IN THE STATE BECAUSE UNTIL WE BUILD THAT ARE OUR SYSTEM OF FOSTER CARE WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY US T. I. T. PEOPLE AT TWENTY EIGHT AND UNTIL WE BUILD OUTS THAT THINGS LIKE MOBILE RESPONSE. THAT DIVERT KIDS AN OPPORTUNITY MOMENTS INTO AWAY FROM PLACES LIKE HOSPITALS AND GROUP CARE AND INTO MORE -- SUPPORTED HOME BASED SERVICES THEN WE'LL KNOW WHAT WE NEED FOR HIGHER AND SERVICE. WE'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF RUNNING FOR CONTRA COSTA AND SAN FRANCISCO MOBILE RESPONSE TEAMS. AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN I STARTED I HAD WRITTEN DOWN HERE OF THAT WE'VE SEEN IN 80% DIVERSION RATE BUT OUR CLINICAL DIRECTOR IS HERE TODAY AND SHE REMINDED ME THAT WAS EIGHTY THREE POINT SOMETHING PERCENT. YOU CAN'T FORGET THE DECIMAL POINT. THE BOTTOM LINE IS MORE THAN EIGHT OUT OF TEN KIDS DON'T END UP IN A HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM GOING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK. THEY DON'T END UP IN JUVENILE HALL AND THEY DON'T USE A LOCAL POLICE OFFICER AS THEIR CRISIS COUNSELOR. AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM A YOUTH IS IN CRISIS THE PARENT DOESN'T KNOW WHO OR WHAT WHO TO CALL OR HOW TO GET HELP. IN THE END UP COMING INTO A SYSTEM THAT WAS NEVER DESIGNED TO MEET THEIR NEEDS AND TO KEEP THEM OUT OF HIGHER AND SYSTEMS AND PROVIDE SUPPORT. WE'VE DONE SO MUCH IN THE STATE BY PROVIDING WRAPAROUND SERVICES ACROSS THE STATE BY CREATING SYSTEMS TO INTERVENE AND SCHOOLS BY CREATING SYSTEMS THAT CAN INTERVENE EARLIER. THROUGH THE PROCESS OF THE OF THE IRVINE GRANT AND TALKING WITH LEADERS AROUND THE STATE ABOUT WHAT WE COULD DO DIFFERENTLY I BELIEVE THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN DO. THAT WOULD BE MORE IMPORTANT AND MORE IMPACTFUL THAN TO PROVIDE STATEWIDE URGENT RESPONSE SYSTEM I'M HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND JOHANNA IS HERE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS BECAUSE SHE ACTUALLY KNOWS WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT. WE CALLED JOHANNA I THINK WE SHOULD. HI JOHANNA OF OUR BREATH MOBILE RESPONSE TEAM SENECA. AND I PARTICULARLY TRIED TO USE ONLY TWO MINUTES THAT I'D LEAVE YOU A MINUTE OR SO TO ASK QUESTIONS. DOMINANCE HOW MY PROGRAM. SO WE'VE BEEN RUNNING OUR PROGRAMS ARE IT WOULD YOU GAVE YOU MADE IT FOR THE HARSH AS I THOUGHT ARE COMING UP FOR ONE MINUTE TO TELL US NUMBER. SO WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN RUNNING A PROGRAM FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS IN OUR COUNTY -- WHICH IS REALLY SIGNIFICANT A REALLY LONG TIME TO BE RUNNING A PROGRAM HALF OF OUR STAFF HAS BEEN WORKING WITH US FOR MORE THAN FIVE YEARS WHICH IS WHILE CONSIDERING THAT IT'S MENTAL HEALTH IT'S COMMUNITY BASED AND IT'S CRISIS WORK -- I THINK THE BEAUTY OF OUR PROGRAM IS THAT WE'RE JUST REALLY ABLE TO SERVE. FAMILIES AT A TIME THAT'S CONVENIENT FOR THEM AT THEIR HOME ADD IN A SPACE THAT'S COMING UP FOR THEM IN THEIR LANGUAGE -- IT'S REALLY MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS RESPONDING MENTAL HEALTH CRISES -- REALLY THERE TO ADVOCATE FOR THEM AND REALLY SUPPORT THEM THROUGHOUT THAT ENTIRE PROCESS WHAT WE DO HAVE A GREAT DIVERSION RATE IT WE DON'T ALWAYS GET TO DIVERT BUT WE DO GET TO HELP -- CHANCE FOR THEM TO THE HOSPITAL BE WITH THEM THROUGHOUT THAT PROCESS AND REALLY SUPPORT THEM AND PROVIDE FOLLOW UP SERVICES IF THEY NEED ANY -- SO THE CONFLICT OVERVIEW OF WHAT WE DO -- HAPPY AND IF IF I COULD JUST ADD TO THAT TIME AND TIME AGAIN. WE IN MOST OF OUR COUNTY STACK PROVIDES PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE. AND MOST OF OUR CAN AS WE DON'T HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF HAVING LEVEL RESPONSE. AND SO WHAT WE SEE IS A CYCLE WHETHER WHERE EITHER POLICE OR SOMETIMES MENTAL HEALTH AND BEING. A CHILD ENDS UP IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM IN THE HOSPITAL USUALLY THOSE WAIT TIMES WHEN SOMEBODY'S IN THE KID PSYCHIATRIC CRISIS. IS OUR FOUR SIX EIGHT AT THE I'VE HEARD NIGHTMARE STORIES OF MUCH LONGER YOU KNOW THE STORIES -- OFTEN ARE TEENAGERS SIMPLY WALK OUT. THEY DON'T EVEN WAIT TO GET HELP. THAT'S BEST CASE SCENARIO. WORST CASE SCENARIOS LAW ENFORCEMENT IS CALLED. THE SOMETHING HAPPENS THAT TAKES THEM DOWN THAT TRAJECTORY AND THEY'RE IN JUVENILE HALL AND THEN IN RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT OR IN A GROUP HOME. OF AT AND AND SO MANY OF THOSE SITUATIONS ARE UNNECESSARY. SO MANY OF THE SITUATIONS WHEN WE GET TENER BEING AT THE OPTIMAL POINT. CAN PROVIDE THE PIVOT POINT THAT ALLOWS US TO KEEP KIDS AT HOME OR IN A FOSTER HOME. OR IN THE COMMUNITY AND IN THE COMMUNITY -- I KNOW THAT THE SO WE HAVE MANY SOCIAL WORKERS HERE AT THE CAPITOL FOR THEIR LOBBY DAY. AND THEY HAVE SHARED THE TO WHAT A NIGHTMARE FOR THEM IS TO PICK UP THE PHONE AND TO HAVE A PARENT SAY. I'VE GIVEN UP ON GIVING MY CHILD TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO GET OUT OF HERE -- THE AFTER OUR CHILDREN YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE HAVE ALREADY EXPERIENCES TRAUMA FROM. TO BE PLACED INTO FOSTER CARE. IT'S SO IMPORTANT BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THAT AND I THINK THAT THIS FAMILY URGENT RESPONSE SYSTEM. IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT -- WE WE NEED TO PRESERVE THE PLACEMENT. AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND NOT FOR THE TRAUMATIZED THAT FOSTER YOUTH. WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT AND I I SINCERELY APPRECIATE -- THE COMP YOUR COMMENTS ON THIS AS WELL -- TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE THAT WE HAVE LOTS OF FOSTER YOUTH. THERE WAS ONE INSTANCE WHERE THEY WERE ALL HOLDING UP THEIR SIGNS TO HOW MANY TIMES HAVE BEEN PLACED [inaudible] FOURTEEN THIRTY EIGHT THE THIS THIS IS WE ALL LIKED WE ALL AGREE THIS IS ALL. UNACCEPTABLE HAVING A HOTLINE HAVING DOING EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE TO DO. TO KEEP OUR CHILDREN. BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ARE OUR CHILDREN TO KEEP THEM FROM. BEING FURTHER TRAUMATIZED AND TO FIGURE OUT TO DATE DOING THE THE TRIAGE. TO FIND OUT THE TO KEEP THEM AWAY FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT TO KEEP THEM AWAY FROM HOSPITALS -- IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. I KNOW THE DOCTOR ARAMBULA -- THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF HIS TOP PRIORITIES AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE IT A TOP PRIORITY. FOR FOR THIS FOR THIS COMMITTEE -- I THINK CREATING THIS NURTURING ENVIRONMENT JUST AS YOU'VE DESCRIBED IT NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE A PRE PLACEMENT. VISIT THE TO MAKE YOU DO WITH THE PARENTS SO THAT THE PARENTS THEN KNOW WHO CAN SUPPORT THEM TELL US ABOUT THAT WE DO WE'VE RECEIVER FARRELL'S FROM A VARIETY OF PLACES WE HAVE A PRETTY. AWESOME RELATIONSHIP BUT OUR LOCAL THANK EMERGENCY SERVICE AND SO KIDS THAT GO THROUGH THERE THAT AREN'T FULLY LINKED ON WE GET ALL THEIR DISCHARGE PAPERWORK AND WERE ABLE TO REACH OUT TO THEM -- AND I WOULD SAY ABOUT 20% OF OUR YOUTH ARE FOSTER YOUTH RIGHT NOW BUT WE GET TO CALL. THE FAMILY SAY HEY WE UNDERSTANDING JUST WENT THROUGH THIS CRISIS CAN WE COME OUT THERE INTRODUCED OUR SERVICE TO YOU IF THIS WAS THE COME UP AGAIN HOW CAN WE SUPPORT YOU WHAT OTHER. RESEARCH CAN PROVIDE FOR YOU WE ALSO GET REFERRALS FROM TEACHERS SOCIAL WORKERS -- LAW ENFORCEMENT SOMETIMES LONG PERSONAL WHAT THE HOUSE SEVERAL TIMES AND THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO DO AND SO THEY ACTUALLY REFER TO US -- A FEW MONTHS AGO THERE WAS A WOMAN. WHO ARE HER SON WAS HAVING A TANTRUM IN THE STORE AND ANOTHER PARENT SAID TO HER HATE CALL THESE PEOPLE THEY CAN HELP YOU AND SO THAT'S MY MOST PROUDEST REFERRAL THAT WE'VE GOT IN -- BUT WE DEFINITELY CAN THEN REACH OUT TO THOSE FAMILIES AND SAY -- YOU KNOW WE WE HEARD ABOUT YOU MIGHT BENEFIT FROM OUR SERVICES CAN COME OUT AND INTRODUCE OURSELVES -- WE FIND THAT WE NEED TO HAVE THAT INITIAL ASSESSMENT WERE ABLE -- TO IT'S LIKE A WARM HAND OFF AND THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO UTILIZE US DURING A CRISIS. THANK YOU WERE PLAYING MUSICAL CHAIRS. ACTUALLY THE LAST TWO WEEKS HAVE BEEN THAT WAY SO I APPRECIATE YOUR OF FLEXIBILITY HERE -- SOUL ANY REACTION OR FEEDBACK FROM THE ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ARE ALEJO. I'D SAY THE GREG ROSE AGAIN FOR THE DEPARTMENT CERTAINLY WERE AWARE OF THESE TYPES OF SERVICES -- AND PROGRAMS AND IN OTHER STATES AND AND IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND I THINK THAT THE KEY FOR US IS THAT THE KEY FOR ME WHEN I THINK ABOUT IS. HOW WE GO ABOUT HOW IMPLEMENTATION AGO ABOUT IT MANY OF THE PLACES I'M AWARE IT ARE RIGHT OUR SMALL SMALLER -- JURISDICTIONS AND DO WE DO HAVE. URBAN AND RURAL AND DISTANCE AND A NUMBER OF THINGS TO CONSIDER BUT WE ARE IN FACT AWARE OF OF OF THE UTILITY OF THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS AND WE'VE SEEN THEM IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS. AND IF I MAY THE ALLEN BEATS SO WAS ONE OF THE ENGINEERS OF THE NEW JERSEY SYSTEM WHICH IS ACTUALLY A LARGER MORE SKILLED SYSTEM AND HE WORKED. WITH US ON SOME OF THE IDEAS AROUND CONSTRUCTION OF THE SYSTEM AND HOW IT CAN BE SCALED -- MOBILE RESPONSE ACTUALLY. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH IS IN A MORE COST EFFECTIVE PROGRAM AT SCALE THE THE SMALLER IT IS THE MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE AVAILABILITY. AND AN UNUSED AVAILABILITY IS REALLY EXPENSIVE. SO SO TO THE DEGREE THAT YOU CAN HAVE DEPTH IN TEAMS TO RESPOND TO A BROADER AREA YOU DO GET. NOT JUST SMALL ECONOMIES OF SCALE BUT BIG ECONOMIES OF SCALE AROUND THE INITIAL RESPONSE ESPECIALLY SO THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT REALLY WORK ABOUT A STATEWIDE SYSTEM THAT ARE VERY DIFFICULT IN THE SMALLER SYSTEMS THAT WE'RE RUNNING. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT. JUSTIN PRENTICE BERMAN FINANCE -- AS WITH ALL THE PROPOSALS ARE WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON ANY OF THEM AT THIS TIME -- SO AGAIN. TO THE EXTENT IT'S PRIORITY OF THE LEGISLATURE WERE HAPPY. TO ENGAGE WITH ON THE DON'T. THANK YOU FOR THE LAST YOU HEAR THAT [inaudible] ELIA. THANK YOU RIGHT WELL THANK YOU AND THEN I'LL GOING TO COLLAPSE -- SUSAN AND IF [inaudible] THANK YOU. AND WE'LL BE DISCUSSING CONTINUED EMERGENCY CARE GIVER FUNDING AT THE TIME OF PLACEMENT. I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION EARLIER BETWEEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO IN THE STATE -- US ALL OF THE LA US COMMENTS HIM TO BE TALKING A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE FUNDING -- AS A STATE MANSION LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION CAME TOGETHER HEN THEY STAND A CRISIS. AND YOUR FOR YOUR FUNNY AT THE TIME A PLACEMENT HAS JUST BEEN A LIFESAVER. FOR TEN THOUSAND THE FAMILY TO ME JUST SO MANY FOLKS ON WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT HOWEVER WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE COMING YEAR. SO IN THE DEAL THAT WAS MADE LAST YEAR WE THOUGHT WE WOULD BE AT NINETY DAYS ISSUE NOTED THE STATE THOUGHT WE WOULD BE THERE AND SO. IN THE LEGISLATION WE NOW CUT OFF THAT FUNDING IT NINETY DAYS STARTING ON JUNE THIRTIETH. AND THERE'S ALSO NO GOOD BECAUSE EXEMPTION ANYMORE SO ALL THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE AND ALL THIS GOOD NEWS THAT THE STATE GAVE YOU. ALL ENDS ON JUNE THIRTIETH. SAYS ADVOCATES WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT WE WOULD ASK THE LEGISLATURE TO REALLY WHO WORK WITH US TO CONTINUE THE AMAZING WORK THAT HAPPENED. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE EXTEND TO AT LEAST A HUNDRED AND TWENTY OR A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT EIGHTY DAYS. BECAUSE A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS IS THE CURRENT AVERAGE. SAID ANYTHING BELOW THAT REALLY IS GOING TO PUT FAMILIES AT RISK WE ALSO REALLY ENCOURAGE THE GOOD BECAUSE EXEMPTION WOULD NEED THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME FAMILIES THAT. FOR REASONS BEYOND THEIR CONTROL IT GOES PAST THAT THEY CAN'T JUST LOSE FUNDING OVER THINGS THAT ARE NOT UNDER THEIR CONTROL. IT HARMS NOT ONLY THESE FAMILIES BUT ALSO THE CHILDREN IN THEIR CARE. THANK YOU FOR POINTING THAT OUT BECAUSE I'M -- AS WE SPOKE EARLIER -- I REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE BY NOW WE HAVE TO OBVIOUSLY CONTINUE BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE THAT AGAIN PUTTING IN DANGER THOSE FAMILIES. THAT HAVE STEPPED UP TO SUPPORT THOSE CHILDREN SOUL WHAT CAN WE TOGETHER DO AND OUT WHAT SPECIFIC -- SUGGESTIONS RECOMMENDATIONS -- CAN YOU PROVIDE SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE WITH THIS. ABSOLUTELY AND APPRECIATE THE EGG KNOWLEDGE MEN OF THEIR EARLIER CONVERSATION I MEAN THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF AN AREA WHERE A CONVERSATION AMONGST MULTIPLE GROUPS GROUPS AND THE ADMINISTRATION AND COUNTIES IN THE LEGISLATURE. RESULTED IN A GOOD SOLUTION TO A KNOWN PROBLEM THE WORLD'S DYNAMIC -- AS WITH MANY THINGS YOU'VE HEARD TODAY AND YOU KNOW -- IN THE THERE'S AN UNWRITTEN RULE SOMEWHERE THAT IF IF I TOLD YOU -- THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT ISSUES FROM REVISION -- THAT THAT WOULD BE A FAUX PAS SO I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU THAT. HELLO BUT I WOULD IN NO WAY TEN I DIDN'T HEAR -- BUT YET BUT BUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY -- AS I MENTIONED THE GOVERNOR DIDN'T WEIGH IN ON C. C. R. NOGEN TEN PROPOSAL SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE NEED TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATION NOW THAT HE'S BEEN IN OFFICE FOR A FEW MONTHS PERHAPS IT'S A TIME. FOR YOU KNOW FOR HIM TO TAKE A BETTER LOOK AT WHAT'S I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT HE'D BE INTERESTED IN THE CONVERSATION. THANK YOU NO I APPRECIATE THAT AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT OUT BECAUSE AGAIN YOU KNOW AT WE I WANT TO AGAIN COMPLIMENT. YOU ON THE WORK THAT YOU HAVE DONE BY CLEARLY THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE SO PLEASE DON'T LET THIS FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS -- AT AT SOME POINT -- WE NEED TO BE ENGAGED AS PARTNERS WITH BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T BRING IT UP AND WE DON'T BRING IT UP. THERE AND THEN IT GOES BY THE WAYSIDE SHELTER YOU WILL WERE FALLING CONFIDENCE THANK YOU DROPS I APPRECIATE AND I LOOK FORWARD -- TO MAKING SURE THAT WITH THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE HAD AND AND FOR THE GOVERNOR TO NOT LOOK AT THEM ME REVISION OR LOOK AT IT WHATEVER IT IS THAT HE WANTS TO DO BY THESE ARE -- IMPORTANT INVESTMENTS IF WE WANT TO KEEP CALLING THEM THAT I THINK IT'S AN INVESTMENT BUT FOR ME IT'S LIFESAVING MEASURES FOR SOME OF THESE THESE FAMILY SOLD THANK YOU [inaudible] OKAY. THEN WHAT TIME YOUR FAVORITE OKAY -- THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FROM FINANCE HELLO YES IF I MAY I MEAN I I BROKE A LITTLE BIT OF A ROLL TALKING ABOUT THAT I DO I WANT TO BE. I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR I DID NOT COMMIT THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING NOT MANY DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING THIS YEAR BUT I DON'T NOT CREATION IS ABSOLUTELY PART OF THE CONVERSATION AROUND IT'S NO NO AND I AND AND I APPRECIATE THAT -- BUT AGAIN YOU KNOW IF WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE WITH THIS WORK WE NEED SOME SOME -- INDICATION THAT AT LEAST THE POT IS IN THERE AND I THAT'S WHAT I HEARD THAT THERE'S SOME THINKING ABOUT IT I KNOW THAT YOU DIDN'T MAKE A COMMITMENT BY IT BUT IT'S REFRESHING. FOR ME TO TO HEAR THAT THERE HAS BEEN SOME THOUGHTS PUT INTO IT AND SO I'M NOT COMMITTING YOU TO ANYTHING YET -- BUT IT'S OUR PASSION A COMMON APPLIES TO A NUMBER OF THINGS C. C. R. AS A LIVE ANIMAL AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. THANK YOU [inaudible] OKAY SO. THANK YOU AND THEN -- FRANK -- WE ARE. YOU ARE UP AGAIN TALKING ABOUT RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL AND CANCER ASSESSMENT AND I KNOW WE HAD SOME DISCUSSION ALREADY ABOUT THE APPROVALS. SO IF WE CAN -- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR POP FRANK MACKESY WTA WE HAVE INDEED MADE OUR CASE FOR CONTINUING THE RFA FUNDING SO I WON'T -- REITERATE THAT HERE AND ON CANS IT'S A NEW FAMILY CHILD ASSESSMENT TOOL WE'VE COME UP WITH A PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE WITH THE STATE OF HOW MUCH IT'S GOING TO COST THE COUNTIES TO IMPLEMENT IT. WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO WORK WITH US TO TRACK THE ACTUAL COSTS SO GOING FORWARD WE CAN RIGHT SIZE BUDGETS MOVING FORWARD [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY COMMENTS FROM FINANCE ALEJO DEPARTMENT. RIGHT. THANK YOU. AND TRANSPORTATION OKAY MORE MOVING ON TO TRANSPORTATION TO SCHOOL AND OR OR SCHOOL OF ORIGIN AT TIME OF PLACEMENT -- KRISTIN POWER. AND JORDAN SOSA THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE KRISTIN POWER FOR THE ALLIANCE FOR CHILDREN'S RIGHTS I WE TRUE WE APPRECIATE THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION OF FUNDING AT THE TIME OF PLACEMENT. AND THIS ITEM IS RELATED TO THAT -- THIS IS FUNDING FOR TRANSPORTATION TO THE SCHOOL BOARD CHEN. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT RIGHT THE CHILD IN FOSTER CARE HAS IS THE RIGHT TO REMAIN IN THEIR SCHOOL OF ORIGIN. AND TO BE SURE THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY GET TO THAT SCHOOL AND THE SCHOOL BOARD IN RIGHTS. ARE IMPLEMENTED WE MUST HAVE FUNDING REIMBURSEMENTS THE CARE GIVER FOR TRANSPORTING THAT. CHILD TO THE SCHOOL THE PROBLEM THAT WE SEE EXISTING IS THE CARE GIVERS ARE ONLY ENTITLED TO REIMBURSEMENT FOR PROVIDING TRANSPORTATION TO A SCHOOL BOARD AND ONCE THEY'RE APPROVED AS A RESOURCE FAMILY. RELATIVES AN EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBERS GENERALLY ACCEPT PLACEMENT OF A CHILD BEFORE THEY'VE BEEN APPROVED AS YOU HAVE THAT PREVIOUS DISCUSSION TODAY. AND THE APPROVAL PROCESS IS LENGTHY AND WE KNOW IT'S AVERAGING AT LEAST A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS CURRENTLY. A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS IS AND CAN BE THE MAJORITY OF THE SCHOOL YEAR. FAMILIES CAN'T WAIT THAT LONG TO RECEIVE THE SUPPORT AND WITHOUT FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO COVER THE COST OF TRANSPORTATION IT'S OFFICE UNTENABLE FOR THE FAMILIES TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT. AND TRANSPORT THAT CHILD AT THE SCHOOL BOARD CHEN. WHEN WE SPEAK -- TO HOW IMPORTANT SCHOOL CONNECTIONS ARE AND THIS FUNDING MAKES THAT STABILITY A REALITY. WE REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR A BUDGET PROPOSAL TO ENSURE THAT REIMBURSEMENT FOR TRANSPORTING A CHILD THEIR SCHOOL OF ORIGIN IS INITIATED AT THAT TIME OF PLACEMENTS. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JORDAN SOSA I'M ALL OF FORMER FOSTER YOU FROM LAST LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND I SERVE AT THE STATE WHY POLICY COORDINATOR FOR CALIFORNIA YOUTH CONNECTION. OF BEFORE JUST PROVIDE THE PROVIDING MATHIS MONEY I LIKE TO THINK -- SHEA HOUSE AND MY SISTER ANNA SOSA FOR OPENING MY EYES TO THE TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS MANY YOUTH PHASE OF UP FROM INSTABILITY WITHIN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. MANY YOUNG PEOPLE AND CALIFORNIA'S TROUBLE FOR SYSTEM EXPERIENCE BOTH PLACEMENT AND EDUCATIONAL STABILITY AND IT'S FAR TOO COMMON HEARING THE LACK THE PERMANENCY OF OUR YOUTH EXPERIENCE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM. WE ALWAYS HEAR THE VICIOUS CYCLE OF THE EDUCATIONAL. OUTCOMES FOR OUR FOSTER YOUTH AND ONLY 3% OF GRADUATE FROM HIGHER EDUCATION. WE ALSO KNOW THAT RESEARCH STATES THE EDUCATIONAL DISPARITY BETWEEN FOSTER YOUTH AND THE GENERAL POPULATION IS DUE TO THE EDUCATIONAL INSTABILITY FOSTER YOUTH EXPERIENCE AS A RESULT. OF MULTIPLE PLACEMENT CHANGES EVEN THOUGH I MOVED TO MULTIPLE HOMES AND FAMILIES AND FOSTER CARE I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO STAY IN THE SAME HIGH SCHOOL. HOWEVER THIS IS NOT THE SAME STORY FOR MY THREE YOUNGER SISTERS WHO ARE STILL LIVING IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. I HAVE TO WITNESS MY SISTERS MOVED FROM ONE HOME TO ANOTHER BECAUSE THE SYSTEMS LET THEM DOWN. ST I HAD THE WITNESS SAYING THERE SEE AND SAYING THEIR GOODBYES BECAUSE OF THE SEVEN DAY NOTICE ACTING ALL THEIR BELONGINGS AND SEVEN DAYS AND QUESTIONING IF THEY WERE LOVED OR WANTED WHICH IS THE QUESTION THAT WILL LAST LONGER THAN SEVEN DAYS. WITH THIS WE REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR BUDGET PROPOSAL TO RAISE TO ENSURE THAT REIMBURSEMENTS FOR TRANSPORTATION A CHILD TO THEIR SCHOOL OF ORIGIN IS INITIATED AT THE TIME OF PLACEMENT SO THAT OUR YOUTH CAN THRIVE. AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY AND ONE HOME AND ONE SCHOOL. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY COMMENTS WE'LL. I THINK OUR PRIOR REMARKS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF SUPPORTING FAMILIES WHO MAY BE BEFORE AFTER APPROVAL NEED SUPPORT -- SPEAKS FOR ITSELF. THANK YOU I'M DO. DO YOU AGREE WITH THE ESTIMATE FOR THE PROPOSAL -- AND LET ME JUST KIND OF ELABORATE ON THAT SO WE TALKED ABOUT AT LENGTH EARLIER ABOUT THE THE GREAT. JOB THAT WE'VE DONE AND APPROVING THE FAMILIES -- IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO ENTER IN THE INTERIM TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE ARE FAMILIES ARE RECEIVING THE TRANSPORTATION COSTS AND AGAIN DO YOU AGREE WITH THE ESTIMATE. SO I ARE ALIVE YOU SPEAK TO THE ASPECT BECAUSE I HAVEN'T PERSONALLY SEEN IT SO I I'M NOT QUALIFIED PROBABLY TO TALK ABOUT IT I WILL TELL YOU THAT SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION FUNDING WAS REALIGNED IN TWENTY ELEVEN TO COUNTIES SO STATE VISIBILITY INTO EXACTLY WHAT'S BEING SPENT TODAY AND HOW. MUCH A CASE COSTS IS SOMEWHAT LIMITED. JUST IMPRISONMENT FINANCE WHO I BELIEVE -- THERE'S ALSO COMPANION LEGISLATION THAT'S RELATED TO THAT SO I THINK IT'S A ASSEMBLY BILL -- THREE THREE SEVEN AND AND FINANCES -- I BELIEVE OUR ANALYSIS MIGHT BE OUT I'M NOT SURE BUT I THERE MIGHT BE SOME QUESTIONS WITH THE THE ACTUAL LAST IMMINENT -- WE HAVEN'T REALLY DUG DEEP INTO EVERYTHING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE CASELOAD IS AND BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF COMPONENTS THAT GO INTO THIS SOME. OF THE WAY THE PROGRAM WORKS -- FOR THOSE FAMILIES THAT ARE APPROVED IN YOUR FUNDING AMOUNT IS DEPENDENT UPON YOUR MILEAGE FROM THE HOME. OR IF -- IT'S A A MONTHLY BUS STIPEND AND SO ON SO. THE SIMPLE ANSWER FOR YOU IS -- WE'RE NOT SURE IF THAT'S THE CORRECT ESTIMATE WE'RE NOT SURE IF IT'S TO HIRE IF IT'S TOO LOW -- BUT THERE ARE BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME VARIABLES TO LOOK INTO ON THAT -- SO. I I WON'T SAY WHAT YOU DON'T WANT ME TO SAY -- BUT BUT WE I I I CAN DOUBLE CHECK FOR YOU AND FIND OUT OF OUR ANALYSIS IS PUBLIC RIGHT AND AND AND HOW. NOT ONLY -- IF THE ANALYSIS IS CORRECT BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DETERMINE. IF IT IS TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW -- I THOUGHT THAT WAS A A KIND OF AN ACCOUNTING TYPE OF ISSUE WELL IT'S JUST IT'S LIKE USUAL EVERYTHING IS AN ESTIMATE FOR ITS RIGHT BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT THE CASE THAT IS GOING TO BE AWARE YOUTH MAY. NOT BE PLACED -- GETS A ONE BY ONE TIME A YOUTH COULD POTENTIALLY BE PLACED. THREE MILES FROM -- THEIR SCHOOL BOARD CHEN AND THEN A NEW PLACE SPENDING GREG IF YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING. THEY COULD BE PLACED SOMEWHERE WHERE IT'S TEN MILES AWAY SO -- WE WE DO TAKE AND ALL THOSE CONSIDERATIONS WITH WORKING WITH -- THE DEPARTMENT WHEN WE TRY TO COME UP WITH THAT CEMENT SO YOU'RE CORRECT THERE'S NO. PERFECT POINT WE CAN SAY EXACTLY WHAT IT IS BUT WE NEED TO TRY TO DO OUR BEST TO TO GIVE AN ACCURATE OR A BEST ESTIMATE FOR THE LEGISLATURE WHEN WE MAKE OUR ANALYSES. REGRETS THE DEPARTMENT I JUST SAY TO HISTORICALLY WHAT WE DO WE OFTEN DO IS LOOK AT PREVIOUS EXPENDITURES FOR A SIMILAR -- POPULATIONS OF THE FOR THOSE APPROVED VERSES THE OF FOLKS THAT ARE TO PROVE WE COULD LOOK WE CAN LOOK AT THOSE PREVIOUS EXPENDITURES. AS AS AS MISTER SPEAKER JUST SAID -- SOME OF THOSE BECAUSE OF REALIGNMENT THAT THE PRECISION OF THE OF KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT WAS SPENT -- IS IS A LITTLE LESS PRECISE THAN IT HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN BUT THERE ARE SOME. WAYS IN WHICH WE COULD PARTNER WITH FINANCE AND THE ADVOCATES TO KIND OF LOOK THROUGH TO ME I WOULD HOPE SO. THANK YOU. IF YOU COULD YOU KNOW I THINK THAT'S YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY AN IMPORTANT PIECE TO THIS IF WE CAN'T -- PROVIDE THE THE MONEY IF WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY WE'RE GOING TO NEED FOR IT SO. THAT OUR FAMILY FOUNDER COUNTIES TO BE HELPFUL AND COLLECTING DATA OR SURVEY IN A COUPLE SELECT COUNTIES FOR US TO HELP ENABLE THOSE ESTIMATES.

AND AND THAT MEANS THAT WHEN. YOU HAVE A YOUTH WITH A YOU WITH AN EDUCATION. THEIR FAMILIES EXTENDED FAMILIES -- OR FRIENDS ARE GOING TO BE LESS LIKELY TO TAKE THEM INTO THEIR HOME IF THEY THEN HAVE TO PAY THE RESTITUTION OF THE YOUTH -- FOR THEIR DEDICATION AND SO THAT THE LAW IS VERY OLD.

YES SHARE WITH ME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO. TRAVELED FROM CHICO AND MERCED AND ALL AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT FOR THIS PROPOSAL OUT OF ORDER. IT MEANS A LOT TO THEM AND TO US THANK YOU. MY NAME IS AMY LEVEL IAN AT THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF JOHN BURTON ADVOCATES FOR YOUTH AND I'M SPEAKING TODAY ON BEHALF OF HIS STATEWIDE COALITION. OF OVER TWO WOULD ORGANIZATIONS TO REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN THE STATE'S TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM. KNOWN AS TEACH PEOPLE US. THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE CREATED TEACH PEOPLE US IN TWO THOUSAND ONE IN THE MOST RISK IT RECENTLY COMPLETED FISCAL YEAR IT PROVIDED SAFE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND COMPREHENSIVE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. YOUTH AND THEIR FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY EIGHT CHILDREN. WHEN CALIFORNIA EXTENDED FOSTER CARE TO AGE TWENTY ONE IN? TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE POPULATION SERVED BY TEACH PEOPLE PLUS CHANGED CONSIDERABLY. INSTEAD OF LARGELY SERVING EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY ONE YEAR OLDS THP PLUS NOW SERVES OLDER MORE VULNERABLE FORMER FOSTER YOUTH. THIS INCLUDES PRIMARILY CUSTODIAL PARENTS AND YOUTH WITH DISABILITIES. TEACH PEOPLE ALSO SERVES AS A VALUABLE SAFETY NET FOR A NOT SMALL BUT LARGELY INVISIBLE GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE THESE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE AGED EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY ONE WHO DON'T QUALIFY FOR EXTENDED FOSTER CARE. THIS IS A GROUP THAT WE WE VERY RARELY SPEAK OF AND UTILIZE TEACH PEOPLE IT'S CONSIDERABLY. THIS PROGRAM IS BEEN EVALUATED EVERY YEAR SINCE. TWO THOUSAND SIX A CONSISTENTLY FOUND TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR YOUTH NOTABLY IN AREAS OF HOUSING STABILITY MONTHLY EARNINGS AND EMPLOYMENT. SO CLEARLY THIS IS A WELL ESTABLISHED EFFECTIVE STATE PROGRAM. HOWEVER IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THIS PROGRAM IS AT RISK. THE STATE BUDGET FOR TEACH PEOPLE PLUS HAS REMAINED UNCHANGED SINCE. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN DURING THE SAME SENSE THAT SAME PERIOD OF TIME THE COST OF HOUSING CALIFORNIA. HAS INCREASED BY 50%. SO NOT SURPRISINGLY AS THE DEMAND FOR HOUSING HAS SKYROCKETED SO HAS DEMAND FOR THIS VITAL SAFETY NET PROGRAM. WE DID A MOMENT IN TIME SNAPSHOT IN A AND IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THERE WERE OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN ELIGIBLE YOUTH WAITING TO ENTER TEACH PEOPLE PLUS. LOS ANGELES AND SAN DIEGO COUNTIES EACH HAD A WAITING LIST OF OUR FIFTY YOUNG PEOPLE AGAIN OVER HALF OF WHO ARE CUSTODIAL PARENTS. THESE ARE FORMER FOSTER YOUTH WHO WERE IN CARE UNTIL AGE. EIGHTEEN WE'RE NOT ABLE TO ACHIEVE PERMANENCE AND NOW FIND THEMSELVES YOU DON'T. SEVERAL YEARS AFTER HOMELESS. SO THE CURRENT BUDGET PROPOSAL IS AN EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT TEACH PEOPLE US. THIS WOULD ALLOW THE EXPANSION OF THIS VITAL SAFETY NET PROGRAM IT WOULD ALSO SLIGHTLY MODIFIED THE ELIGIBILITY FOR THE PROGRAM REALLY IT'S CLOSING MORE OF A OF A LOOPHOLE. CURRENTLY TO BE IN THIS PROGRAM YOU HAVE TO BE IN CARE AT AGE EIGHTEEN IT WOULD SLIGHTLY MODIFY THE PROGRAM SO THAT IF YOU WERE IN CARE BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND EIGHTEEN IF YOU LATER BECAME HOMELESS YOU COULD. PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO CHEAT PERMITS DURING THAT TWO YEAR WINDOW. HOWEVER THESE YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE LARGELY THE SAME EXPERIENCE OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO REMAINING CARE TELL EIGHTEEN AND YET WE CUT OFF ACCESS TO THIS VITAL PROGRAM. AND WE ACTUALLY CREATE A DISINCENTIVE FOR PERMANENCE. SO THIS IS A VERY LONG STANDING SUCCESSFUL STATE PROGRAM THAT IS REALLY OFFERED A BETTER BRIGHTER FUTURE FOR THOUSANDS OF FORMER FOSTER YOUTH IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE STRONGLY URGE FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS PROPOSAL AND WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO INTRODUCE J. T. WHO IS THE CURRENT PARTICIPANTS. GOOD AFTERNOON PHONE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S J. T. OF TWENTY YEARS OF MY FRESHMAN YEAR. SEXY COLLEGE ON A PARTICIPATING. A DOUBLES TSC PLUS PROGRAM.

TWENTY ONE BEING IN FOSTER CARE IS DIFFICULT WHO'S PRETTY STABLE UNTIL THE AGE OF TWELVE WHEN I MOVED FROM PLACEMENT A PLACEMENT LIVING IN SOLANO COUNTY. COUNTER CUSTER. IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY THESE MOVES MADE A HARD FOR ME TO TRUST MANY PEOPLE EXCEPT A LOT OF THINGS WELL GONNA. AT THE AGE OF TWENTY MY FOSTER MOM WAS EVICTED FROM ROMAN -- QUOTE AND SHE TOLD ME THAT I COULDN'T MOVE WITH HER I WAS HOMELESS AND LIVING LIVING WITH MY FRIENDS ON A COACH IS. DURING THIS TIME OF I WAS CALLING SHOULDERS AND OTHER PROGRAMS FINALLY HAVE FOUND THE PROGRAM. ADOLFO. SINCE ARRIVING AT A DOUBLE THEY'VE HELPED ME. PROACTIVELY. MOVE ABOUT MOVING FORWARD WITH MY LIFE AND NOW LIVING IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT AND CREATING A POSITIVE FUTURE FOR MYSELF. ALSO A DOVE LESS HELP ME GET A JOB AS A TEACHER'S AIDE TO POUR MY DREAM OF BEING AN ARTIST. THEY'VE PROVIDED ME VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE HELP WITH CERTAIN CERTAIN THINGS IN OUR SUPPLIES TRANSFERRED MY OUR DEFENSE WAS Y. DISPLAYED MORE WORK AND SOLD MY PAINTINGS. CONNECTED ME WITH OTHER ARTISTS AND MENTORS AND EMPOWER ME. TO PURSUE MY PASSION MY THG PLUS PROGRAM HAS HELPED ALSO HELP ME ROLE IN THE SEXY.

ADULTS WILL HELP ME APPLY IN COMPLETE MY FAST FOOD UNTIL -- A MUCH FASTER MY FINANCIAL AID OPTIONS IN CONNECT WITH OTHER FOSTER YOUTH PROGRAMS EVEN PAID FOR MY STUDENT FEES. THEY'RE ALWAYS ENCOURAGING SUPPORTIVE SUPPORTIVE AND HELPED ME MAINTAIN MY PASS AND GOALS. ALSO THEY'RE VERY PATIENT WHEN THINGS GET HARD FOR ME IN THE PAST I'VE HAD I'VE HAD STRUGGLED BUT HAVING THEIR SUPPORT HAS HELPED ME. WELL BETTER THAN. I'VE DONE BEFORE I HAVE ADHD WHICH REQUIRED A LOT OF PATIENTS THEY HAVE CONNECTING WITH GOOD THERAPISTS AND OTHER COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT. THIS SUPPORT CAN BE DIFFICULT AND ALSO ARE TO DEVELOP. ESPECIALLY AS A FORMER FOSSIL WHO HAS BEEN A SYSTEM FOR A LONG TIME WITHOUT TEARS YOU PLUS I PROBABLY HOMES. AND I'D STILL BE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO AND FOCUS ON HOME. THEY'VE HELPED ME FOCUS ON WHAT IT TAKES TO BE SUCCESS IN. MORE OF FOSTER YOUTH IN. CALIFORNIA NEED NEED THIS HELP SO I STRONGLY AGREE THROUGH. TO URGE THIS PROPOSAL. IN THE STATE AS RUMORS HE BERMAN LIKES A LOT TO TAKE IN BUT LIKE. I REALLY THINK THAT LIKE THE TEARS HE PLACES WITH IT'S A REALLY IT'S A REALLY. GOOD THING N. ANYTHING THAT'S FOR ITS HELPFUL SO. IN IS A LOT OF OTHER. YOU'VE BETTER LIKE IN THE SAME POSITION AS ME LIKE THEY MIGHT NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WANT TO DO AT SCHOOL AND STUFF BUT LIKE. PROGRAMS LIKE THIS HELP LIKE A HELP US GAIN AN IDEA -- SO. ANY SUPPORT WOULD BE REALLY GREAT SO I RECOMMENDED. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING YOUR TESTIMONY -- IT'S ALWAYS IMPORTANT TO HEAR FROM THE VERY PEOPLE WHO ARE AFFECTED. GIVE ALL THE THE THE THE REST OF US TALKING ABOUT AN ISSUE. BUT WHEN SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN IN THE SYSTEM HAS EXPERIENCED IT THE GOOD AND THE BAD CAN COME IN AND TALK TO US. MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE A CONGRATULATIONS ON BEING AT SAID -- SEX CITY. THANK YOU VERY GOOD THE BEGINNING RIGHT YEAH THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT IN YOUR YOUR SON. EVEN A SON WITH YOU. HOW DID YOU SAY YOU HAVE A SON NO NO? EVER BRING A PIECE OF HIS ARTWORK BUT WE WERE IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO BRING IT UP WE'RE NOT. I THOUGHT I HEARD THAT. ALL RIGHT WELL WONDERFUL I I DO WANT TO HEAR FROM DSS AND THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE. DO YOU AGREE WITH THE ESTIMATES OF THE PROPOSAL DO UNDERSTAND THE PROPOSAL YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL. A JET GENERAL MARK THAT RIGHT SO -- SHE SHE WILL ALLUDED TO CHANGING A LITTLE BIT THE ELIGIBILITY IN A PROGRAM AS I'VE SAID A COUPLE TIMES TODAY ALREADY THE CHILD WELFARE WAS A REAL LINE PROGRAM THIS IS ONE OF THOSE REALIGNED PROGRAM FUNDING. OUR AVAILABILITY OF DATA IS SOMEWHAT LIMITED TO EVALUATE A REQUEST. IT'S NO SECRET IN CALIFORNIA THE SUPPLY AND COST OF HOUSING IS A MAJOR BARRIER FACED BY WHO -- MAYBE MORESO BY FOSTER YOUTH AND FORMER FOSTER YOUTH THAN ANY OTHER POPULATION. IN THE STATE A G. BEING AN EXTENDED FOSTER CARE GENERALLY MEANS PURSUIT OF WORK OR EDUCATION BOTH OF WHICH ARE WORTH SUPPORTING -- SO I DON'T REALLY HAVE A WAY TO TELL YOU EIGHT MILLION IS THE RIGHT NUMBER FIVE MILLIONS OF RIGHT NUMBER TEN MILLION SO RIGHT NUMBER I DON'T THINK IT WE CAN OFFER. IN ON THAT BUT I THINK YOU YOU AS YOU AS YOU YOURSELF JUST SAID IT WE TALKED EARLIER YOU KNOW THE USE VOICE TALKING ABOUT THEIR LIFE YOU DON'T COMPETE WITH THAT STORY AND SO WE RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF THE PROGRAM. AND ITS IMPORTANCE TO THE YOUTH PARTICIPATING IN IT [inaudible] THANK YOU. THE SPACE BAR FINANCE OF WHILE YOU WERE JUGGLING YOUR MANY HATS EARLIER -- JUST MADE A BLANKET STATEMENT FOR FINANCE AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY POSITION ON ANY OF THE AFRICAN PROPOSALS AT THIS TIME. DOES THE NUMBER OF HERE CORRECT TO YOU THOUGH. FROM THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE WITHOUT GIVING IT AN OPINION A WAS TO WHETHER OR NOT IT'S GOOD FOR OR NOT BUT TO PART OF THAT WOULD BE WHY WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON IT -- THE ONLY THING I CAN REITERATING AGAIN IS THE SAME THING THAT THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR THANK YOU THAT THAT -- THE THE PROGRAM THAT IS REQUESTING FUNDING FOR THIS IT WAS REALIGNED AS A PART OFTHE TWO THOUSAND AND REALIGNMENT SO -- TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS AND THAT BEING -- PRIORITY ANY GENERAL FUND -- ERR ANY WHETHER IT'S A BUDGET PROPOSAL OR LEGISLATION THERE ON THAT'S A GENERAL FUND -- RESOURCES WOULD BE NECESSARY. WE DO KNOW THAT THERE IS SOME PROPOSED LEGISLATION -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEAM WHO IS. THE BUDGET CHAIR -- DOES HAVE A BILL IN THIS IN THIS AREA. WONDERFUL COMMENTS QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT LET'S GO. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT ON ISSUE. THREE ALL RIGHT WE UNDERSTAND THAT LIBERTY SONGES IS TAKING KATHY'S PLACE. AND YOUR CAR A CARSON. CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. MISTER CURRY HERE [inaudible] YES OKAY. ISSUE THREE PROMOTING HOUSING STABILITY FOR TRANSITION AGE YOUTH ADVOCACY PROPOSAL. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS LIBBY SANCHEZ ON BEHALF OF A C. R. U. CALIFORNIA ALSO PRETENDING TO BE KATHY SUDDENLY MCDONALD TODAY SAME CURLS DIFFERENT COLOR -- SO AB TWELVE IS ONE OF OUR PROUDEST ACHIEVEMENTS THE LEGISLATURE'S -- OUR SOCIAL WORKERS -- COUNTY PARTNERS AND ALL OF CHILD WELFARE SERVICES PARTNERS AT A SHINING MOMENT RATE OF OF PROGRAM THAT REALLY REALLY WORKS AND WE HAVE. REALLY VERIFIABLE OUTCOME MARKERS THAT WE CAN POINT TO WE KNOW THAT AB TWELVE YOUTH -- PARTICIPANTS SEE BETTER EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES BETTER -- WORK OUTCOMES AND BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES OVERALL -- WHAT WE HAVE ALSO NOTICED THAT TEN YEARS AND TO THE PROGRAM IS THAT THERE ARE SOME UNANTICIPATED THINGS THAT LEAD US TO BE HERE TODAY TO ASK FOR SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING? ON WE DIDN'T REALIZE HOW GREAT OF A TAKE OPERATE THERE WAS GOING TO BE -- IN THIS PROGRAM AND WHAT A NEED THAT WAS FOR THIS PROGRAM FOR YOUTH. EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY ONE NOR DID WE UNDERSTAND REALLY THE INTRICACIES INVOLVED IN EACH CASE -- THE WORKLOAD INVOLVED IN EACH CASE AND THE NEEDS OF THESE YOUTH MANY OF WHOM HAVE BEEN IN CARE THEIR WHOLE LIVES -- HAVE GONE FROM PLACEMENT TO PLACEMENT AND SO THE VERY -- BASIC THINGS THAT I THINK MANY OF US WHO ARE PARENTS AND ARE TRANSITIONING THEIR KIDS TO COLLEGE AGE -- ARE ABLE TO HELP OUR KIDS WITH. THESE KIDS NEED EXTRA CARE EXTRA TIME -- EXTRA RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE STABLE AND SITUATED -- SO WE ARE ASKING FOR A FEW THINGS THE FIRST OF WHICH IS WERE ASKING FOR THIRTY TWO POINT NINE MILLION ADDITIONAL DOLLARS. FOR CASELOAD WE ARE HAVING -- AS WE MENTIONED A HUGE TAKE UP RATE FOR THIS PROGRAM AND EACH CASE IS REALLY REALLY LABOR INTENSIVE SO THE ABILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE MORE SOCIAL WORKERS. I'M ABLE TO SPEND MORE TIME ON ALL OF THESE CASES IS REALLY IMPORTANT. AND THEN WE'RE ASKING FOR SOME HOUSING TRANSITION DOLLARS WERE ASKING FOR HOUSING NAVIGATORS ON THOSE BUT WE YOU KNOW THERE'S THIS HOUSING CRUNCH WE'RE ALL AWARE OF AND REALLY REALLY HARD WITH LIMITED RESOURCES. AND NOT A LOT OF RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE TO BE ABLE TO FIND AN APARTMENT AND THE PLACEMENT AND SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR FUNDING FOR THAT WERE ALSO LOOKING FOR TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR THINGS LIKE FIRST AND LAST MONTH'S RENT. AND THEN AN ADDITIONAL FOUR MILLION DOLLARS -- TO HELP TRANSITION SO -- I WANTED TO FOR THE REST OF MY TIME TO MR CARSON WHO HAS SOME FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE WITH BEING AN A. B.

THERE'S A TIME IN MY LIFE AND I HAD GOT INVOLVED WITH THE WRONG PEOPLE WHO WEREN'T SUCH A GOOD INFLUENCE ON MY LIFE AND WE'RE HELPING ME GROW. I WAS LIVING IN OAKLEY IN FIRST PLACE WITH YOU AND IT'S HOT AT TIMES THE NEGATIVE SITUATIONS I WAS INVOLVED WE GOT TO THE POINT WHERE THE COPS HAD TO BE INVOLVED.

SOME OF THE GUYS I KNEW FROM OAKLAND HAVE FOUND ME IN MY JOB I FOUND OUT WHERE I LIVE IT WAS THE DANGERS INCIDENT AND COULD HAVE GONE REALLY BADLY. I WASN'T SAFE IN IT WASN'T SAFE FROM MY ROOMMATE BECAUSE THE GUYS TO SHOW UP AT MY PLACE AT ANY TIME MY WIFE A MY E. WANTED TO MOVE ME TO ANOTHER PLACE TO CONQUER FOR SAFETY.

I'M HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY TO SPEAK ABOUT ELIMINATING BARRIERS TO ENSURE THAT YOU. IN NEED OF TRANSITIONAL SERVICES ARE ABLE TO ENTER OR RE ENTER EXTENDED FOSTER CARE. EXTENDED FOSTER CARE BENEFITS ARE CRITICAL AS A YOUTH TRANSITION INTO ADULTHOOD. THESE YOU FACE GREAT CHALLENGES IN COMPLETING THEIR EDUCATION. FINDING A STABLE EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING. HOWEVER A NUMBER OF THE ISSUES HAVE BEEN RAISED IN THE COURTS THAT HAVE PREVENTED A VERY NARROW. GROUP OF FOSTER YOUTH FROM RECEIVING BENEFITS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE ELIGIBLE FOR CURRENTLY FOSTER YOU. SIX TO ACCESS EXTENDED FOSTER CARE SERVICES EIGHT OUT NO ONE UNDER SCORE AIDS OUT. IF THEY'RE TURNED EIGHTEEN BEFORE THEIR CASES ARE FULLY DECIDED. AND YOU THE ALSO PREVENTED FROM ACCESSING INSTEAD OF FOSTER CARE WITH THE GUARDIAN OR THE ADOPTIVE PARENTS CONTINUES. ARE TO RECEIVE BONDS EVEN THOUGH THAT THE FAMILIES NO LONGER -- FINANCIALLY SUPPORT THE YOU THIS BUDGET REQUEST SIX TO CLOSE THE GAP FOR VULNERABLE TRANSITIONING H. FOSTER YOU IN THESE VERY NARROW NARROW NARROW SITUATIONS BY ENSURING THAT WE DO ALL THE WE CAN'T TO EQUIP. ARE YOU WITH THE TOOLS TO SUCCEED. OF THE ADVOCATES AND I HAVE -- CONTINUE TO MEET WITH A D. S. S. AND ALSO D. F. O. TO DETERMINE AT ESTIMATE. CASELOAD. WE RECEIVED A REPORT FROM LA -- X. -- ECSTATIC SEEING -- ESTIMATING COSTS HOWEVER WE HAVE YET TO REACH CONSENSUS -- ON THIS PARTICULAR ITEM -- IT IS OUR HOPE AND OUR DESIRE THEY D. S. S. AND D. O. ELF CAN -- CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US TO RESOLVE THE DIFFERENCES ON CASE LOAD ESTIMATES SO THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD AND CLOSE THE GAP. OF FOR THESE VERY VULNERABLE BUT NARROW YOUTH HERE IN OUR STATE. I'M HERE WITH ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONIES AS A YOUNG PERSON -- WE'RE HAPPY THAT WILL HAVE HERSELF INTRODUCED HERSELF. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MORE IT'S A STUDIO I AM A NON MINOR DEPENDENT FROM CONTRA COSTA COUNTY I'M HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL WHICH WOULD REMOVE A BARRIER TO EXTEND FOSTER CARE FOR YOUTH WHO. ENTER CARE OR RETURNED TO KERR AT AGE. SEVENTEEN I KNOW FROM PROPOSED. I KNOW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE HOW IMPORTANT THE SERVICES AND OPPORTUNITIES OF EXTENT FOSTER CARE CAN BE AND HOW HARD IT IS. TO ACCESS AFTER A CERTAIN AGE I WAS RAISED BY MY GRANDPARENTS STARTING ONE WHEN I WAS AN INFANT MY FATHER'S DISABLED THERE WAS NEVER ABLE TO CARE FOR HIMSELF OR ME. MY MOTHER COULD NOT CARE FOR ME EITHER BECAUSE SHE STRUGGLED WITH SERIOUS DRUG ADDICTION. WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN BOTH OF MY GRANDPARENTS DIED WITHIN A FEW MONTHS OF EACH OTHER? IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE I HAD NO PLACE TO GO. I STARTED COUCH SURFING A REACHING OUT TO COMMUNITY SERVICE PROVIDERS I WAS SERIOUSLY DEPRESSED AFTER MY GRANDPARENTS DIED IT WASN'T SURE WHERE TO TURN. BY THE TIME IS CFS SOCIAL WORKER MET WITH ME AND ACTUALLY EXPLAIN FOSTER CARE AND THE SERVICES AVAILABLE I WAS ABOUT SEVENTEEN AND A HALF. THE SOCIAL WORKER TOLD ME THAT BECAUSE I WAS SO CLOSE TO EIGHTEEN THERE WASN'T ANYTHING CFS WOULD DO FOR ME. SHE TOLD ME THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THINGS IN COR IN TIME TO PROVIDE ME WITH ANY LONG TERM HELP IN IT. AND THAT IT DID NOT MAKE ANY SENSE FOR TO ENTER FOSTER CARE FOR JUST A SHORT TIME. WITHOUT OTHER OPTIONS I KEPT COUCHSURFING AND WORKING WITH OTHER OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT YOU SENT SHELTERS AND TO COME UP WITH THE PLAN. ONE OF THE SHELTER WORKERS REFERRED ME TO A LAWYER WHO WAS FINALLY ABLE TO ASSIST ME WITH ACCESSING FOSTER CARE SERVICES. MY LAWYER COULD NOT GET A CFS CASE THE RECORD AND TIME EITHER SHE WAS FOUND SHE FOUND IT ALL TO SEE CASE AND HAD A CONVERTED TO APPEND TITIAN NOT ALLOWED THE COURT TO PLACE ME IN FOSTER CARE. THE FACT IS I GOT LUCKY AT THE LAST MINUTE. WORKING WITH MY PROBATION OFFICER WHO HAS BEEN REALLY SUPPORTIVE I'VE BEEN ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM TRANSITIONAL HOUSING WAS FIRST PLACE FOR YOU. I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STAY IN THEIR PAEAN KEEP WORKING THROUGH THE LOSS OF MY GRANDPARENTS A FEELING AND FEELINGS ABOUT MY PARENTS. I AM CLOSE TO FINISHING HIGH SCHOOL AND I HAVE A JOB IN TRYING TO SAVE SOME MONEY. I AM WORKING WITH MY PROVIDERS TO COMPLETE COLLEGE APPLICATIONS AND BELIEVE COLLEGE IS A REAL POSSIBILITY. PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT EXTENDING FOSTER CARE FOR ME IS I WAS ABLE TO FIND PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT ME. AND THIS HAS MADE ME ABLE TO CARE ABOUT MYSELF AGAIN WITHOUT THE SUPPORT I CURRENTLY HAVE I BELIEVE THAT I WOULD BE LIVING IN A CAR OR WORSE. I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONTINUE SCHOOL AND I KNOW I WOULD HAVE LOST ALL MOTIVATION TO WORK. I AM SURE THAT COLLEGE WOULD NOT EVEN BE ON MY MIND. I AM ASKING THAT YOU SUPPORT THIS BILL SO THAT CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES ARE ABLE TO HELP YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE ME SO THE OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T LOSE IMPORTANT AND LYFT. LIFE CHANGING SUPPORT JUST BECAUSE THE COURT CASE TAKES TOO LONG TO COMPLETE THANK YOU THANK YOU. MY NAME THEIR INFLUX YES AND I'M HERE FROM BAY AREA LEGAL AID LARGELY TO SUPPORT THIS IDEA WHO'S BEEN BRAVE ENOUGH TO COME IN AND TESTIFY AND I'LL JUST NOTE THAT WE DO BELIEVE THIS IS A NARROW POPULATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE. I'M TO OF THE COMPONENTS WE THINK ARE PRIMARILY TECHNICAL FIXES FOR EXTENDED FOSTER CARE. THE PORTION THAT WOULD ALLOW YOUNG PEOPLE WHO COME IN AT AGE. SEVENTEEN AND DO NOT COMPLETE THEIR CASES IN TIME. TO REMAIN AN EXTENDED FOSTER CARE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE COURT NOT COMPLETING THE JURISDICTIONAL OR DISPOSITIONAL HEARINGS IN TIME. SHOULD BE RELATIVELY SMALL WE'VE ALWAYS MAINTAINED IT IS RELATIVELY SMALL BUT THIS IS OUR THIRD YEAR ATTEMPTING TO REACH CONSENSUS ON THOSE NUMBER SO WE'RE HOPING THIS YEAR THAT. WE CAN FINALLY COME TO A A TRUE COST ESTIMATE AND GET SOME SOME HARD NUMBERS SINCE WE SHOULD BE ABLE [inaudible] TO EVALUATE THAT. THANK YOU BEFORE I ASK THE QUESTIONS I WOULD TELL YOU THAT I I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY THAT YOU'RE FINISHING HIGH SCHOOL. NOW COLLEGES NEXT. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT. THEY ALWAYS TALK ABOUT STATISTICS FOR FOSTER YOU. AND HOW FEW OF FOSTER YOU ACTUALLY GET A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. BECAUSE OF THAT STATISTIC THERE ARE LOTS OF UNIVERSITIES THAT WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU. THEY'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU BECAUSE EVERYBODY WANTS TO PROVE THAT THEY ARE THE UNIVERSITY THAT HAS THE BETTER STATISTICS. WHAT DO ONE STUDY? I WANT TO WORK WITH ANIMALS I'M NOT REALLY SURE PROBABLY IN -- MARINE BIOLOGIST OR SOMETHING. VERY GOOD I I'M SURE THAT THEY'LL FIND THE RIGHT UNIVERSITY FOR YOU COULD BE SAN DIEGO ONE OF THE OTHER UNIVERSITIES ALONG THE COAST BUT LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO YOU. AND AS SOON AS YOU GET TO A COUNSELOR TO BE SURE YOU TELL THEM YOU WANT TO KNOW. EVERYTHING THAT'S AVAILABLE TO YOU. THERE'S A LOT THAT'S AVAILABLE AND THEY'VE LOTS OF PROGRAMS WITH THE STARTED A COMMUNITY COLLEGE LIKE THIS SPEAKER JUST BEFORE YOU OR YOU GO STRAIGHT TO A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE. LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES. INSIST THAT THEY TELL YOU ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT'S AVAILABLE. I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS. THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUE ABOUT TO THE THIS CASE THE CASE LOAD NUMBER. WHAT'S THE EARLIEST THOSE NUMBERS CAN BE PROVIDED. FEATURING A WHAT THE DEPARTMENT -- I I THINK AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT'S BEEN I I THOUGHT IT WAS TWO YEARS NOT THREE UNDER DISCUSSION -- I THINK THERE'S BEEN SOME BACK AND FORTH THERE I'M NOT PERSONALLY FAMILIAR WITH THAT SO I I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE STATUS OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE. THE STAFF IS YEAH GREG ROSE THE DEPARTMENT WE'VE BEEN WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON STAFF AND OTHER ADVOCATES -- WE GET THAT THE NUMBERS THAT THE NUMBERS SHOULD BE AVAILABLE RELATIVELY SOON IT WE BUT WHAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR SOME ACTUAL LANGUAGE TOOK TOOK TAKE A LOOK AT SO THAT WE CAN -- SEE IN FACT IF THE IF THE THAT THAT THAT THE NARROWNESS THAT THAT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS ARTICULATED THERE AS WELL -- ARE ARE ARE. CLEARLY WE AREN'T INTERESTED WE ARE WE ARE INTERESTED IN NOT HAVING YOUNG PEOPLE FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS BECAUSE OF SOME KIND OF YOU KNOW DELAY IN COURT OR THOSE KINDS OF THINGS -- THE THE NUMBER THAT WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN AND BECAUSE WE DON'T A WE HAVE A HARD TIME ACTUALLY VERIFYING THEM -- ARE IN FACT VERY SMALL SO -- I WE WE WERE WAITING ON SOME LANGUAGE AND WE ARE GOING TO FINISH CRUNCH IN SOME NUMBERS AND AND AND PRIVATE PROVIDING THAT BACK TO THE TO THE THE ADVOCATES. TO THE THE EARLIEST WE CAN GET THE UPDATED CASELOAD NUMBERS. RETHINKING A MONTH. LESS -- LESS LESS THAN LESS THAN A MONTH I MEAN WE'RE BASED ON THAT THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT THEY'VE ASKED FOR WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO ONCE WE HAVE THE THE THE THE THAT THAT LANGUAGE BE ABLE TO TO VERIFY IT TO TO COME UP WITH SOME. NUMBER -- AND THEN IT HAS TO BE PART OF THE OVERALL BUDGET PROCESS. TO RECONCILE EVERYTHING BUT CERTAINLY WE CAN DO THAT. IT REALLY APPEARS LIKE A BUREAUCRATIC ISSUE YES -- I I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE ARE DAHLE SUPPORTING THIS. BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT ONCE WE HAVE THE NUMBERS AND PERHAPS WILL BE ABLE TO MOVE. IS THERE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE NUMBER. IS LARGER THAN THE CASE THAT THE CASELOAD THAT THE LA -- HAS ESTIMATED. I THINK THAT WE I DON'T I DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE ANY INFORMATION THAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT THAN THE LA -- TESTAMENT [inaudible] THE END. FINALLY I THINK THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IS CONSIDERING. THAT THIS IS A RELATIVELY SMALL GROUP WAS THE SMALL NUMBER -- IN DESPERATE CIRCUMSTANCES I THINK THAT THAT IS CLEAR AND ALSO FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER GIBSON'S -- TESTIMONY OF THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. THAT IS CLEAR -- ARE THERE ANY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT. DO NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AS A RESULT OF AS A RESULT OF THIS. AGAIN I THINK IT WILL BE ONLY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE -- THAT I COULD IMAGINE IS -- IS IF THERE ARE SOME IF THE THE L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G THE&lt;/c&gt; LANGUAGE THAT WOULD -- THAT IS BEING CLARIFIED SOMEHOW HAS A HAS HAS AN OPENING IN IT THAT WHERE THAT IS IS IN IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED MADE BUT I'M WAITING TO ACTUALLY SEE THE THE SPECIFIC THE THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE OTHERWISE. ANY ENDED THE ONLY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES COULD BE DOES DOES THAT IS THERE ANY KIND OF PERVERSE INCENTIVE FOR FAMILIES TO NOT DO THE RIGHT THING AND HAVE THEIR YOUNG PEOPLE AND UP -- IT IN EXTENDED FOSTER CARE THERE'S BEEN -- THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER STATES WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE THAT -- NOT IN THIS SPECIFIC INCH IS INSTANCE BUT THAT WOULD BE THE ONLY THING I WOULD SAY WE HAVE TO GUARD WE WOULD WANT TO GUARD AGAINST. I HAVE NO INDICATION AT THIS POINT THAT THERE WILL BE. ON UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES BUT AGAIN AND TELL WE ARE CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE I THINK WE WON'T BE ABLE TO BE AS DEFINITIVE THAT YOU'D LIKE US TO BE AT THE MOMENT. AND SO THAT SO THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE LANGUAGE I HAVEN'T SEEN THE LANGUAGE FOR THAT THERE'S A THERE'S A THERE'S A UP. A BILL AND THAT BUDGET ASKED TOGETHER AND WE HAVE SEEN -- WE WE HAVE WE HAVE AYE AYE WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THERE IS UPDATED LANGUAGE TO BE IT'S COMING THE GIPSON. CAN WE GET THAT LANGUAGE TO THEM IMMEDIATELY YES I'M. LOOKING FOR MONTHS WE'VE WE'VE ACTUALLY WE'VE WORKED ON THAT LANGUAGE AND WE MET WITH A VARIETY OF ADVOCATES VERY RECENTLY WE'VE BEEN MEETING WITH THEM FOR THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS AND WE DID. AND I ACTUALLY THANK. MR ROSE HE HAD HE IS VERY HELPFUL IN AND GETTING BACK TO US WITH CONCERNS AND WE'VE TRIED TO ADDRESS I THINK WHAT. WE WERE LOOKING AT OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS SOME HOPEFUL THAT THAT'S DONE THAT LANGUAGE IS READY AND SHOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR YOU TODAY. BUT OKAY IT WILL THERE IT IS. TO THE LANGUAGE WILL BE READY TODAY AND THEN WITHIN A WEEK OR TWO WE'LL GET THE THE THE UPDATED NUMBERS. MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION ALL RIGHT. MADAM CHAIR. YES MY ROOM BY MAY I I THINK. THIS IS A GREAT OPTION AND OF THE TESTIMONY THAT WAS GIVEN -- IN AND PRIOR IT REALLY GOES TO A PASSION -- THAT WE'VE SPOKEN ABOUT ALSO WITH THE HOMELESS YOUTH IN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BEING MORE PROACTIVE IN MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S RESOURCES THAT ARE THERE FOR THEM. SO IN LOOKING AT THAT AND GETTING THAT FINAL LANGUAGE -- TO YOU WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT -- KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS A PROACTIVE MEASURE -- TO KEEP A BALANCE ON FINANCIAL RESOURCES ARE BEING USED IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE OF WERE ABLE TO BE PROACTIVE GET THOSE RESOURCES NOW THAT WE HAVE THAT GREATER IMPACT ON THE HOMELESS YOUTH POPULATION THAT WERE SEEN. IN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. GEN SEEN THOSE THINGS MOVE FORWARD. WE WE WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS MOVING FORWARD BUT WHEN YOU SAID LOOK AT IT PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT ASPECT OF IT IN THE SAVINGS THAT WILL HAPPEN DOWN THE ROAD. BECAUSE THE MONEY WE'RE SPENDING NOW THANK YOU. AND AS HAS BEEN NOTED THESE ARE SEVENTEEN AND A HALF YEAR OLDS. INCOMPLETE PERIL. THE THE THE WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING I MR GIPSON YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN A CHAMPION FOR FOSTER YOUTH. I THANK YOU FOR THAT TO YOU YOU HAVE BEEN. YOUR HEART HAS ALWAYS BEEN THERE AND YOU PUSH THE REST OF US AND YOU MAKE US ALL UNDERSTAND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE SO THAT WERE ALWAYS ON BOARD WITH YOU I THANK YOU FOR FOR ALL THAT ADVOCACY. THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- LA -- OKAY. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH. LET'S GO TO ISSUE. FIVE ASSEMBLYMEMBER GIPSON YOU'RE STAYING RIGHT WITH US SOUNDS THEIR ANNA JOHNSON. AND JUSTIN VERY THIS IF WE CAN BRING YOU BACK. THANK YOU AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M HERE -- BEFORE YOU TODAY TO SPEAK ABOUT REDUCING THE FREQUENCY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT INVOLVEMENT AND DELINQUENCY PETITION FOR FOSTER CHILDREN IN RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES. THIS IS -- THIS ONE TIME INVESTMENT OF NINE MILLION DOLLARS WOULD PROVIDE FUNDING TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WE WANT PROVIDE TRAUMA INFORMED TRAINING AND PROFESSIONAL INTERACTION. WITH BARBEL YOU. AND EXPAND IT DIVERSION PROGRAMS AND DEVELOPMENT TO A PRIEST -- APPROPRIATIONS APPROPRIATE SERVICES TO YOUTH AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS STATEWIDE. THE GOAL. OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO FIND A COMMUNITY BASED INFRASTRUCTURE UP TO DIVERT FOSTER YOU AWAY FROM THE JUVENILE SYSTEM IN WAYS THAT IS BOTH SOCIALLY AND FISCALLY. RESPONSIBLE NOT ONLY DO WE SAVE MONEY BY PREVENTING -- THESE YOUTH FROM CROSSING OVER INTO THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM -- WE REVITALIZED COMMUNITIES BY HELPING THEM BECOME PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS. WHO ARE YOU -- EMOTIONALLY AND ECONOMICALLY STABLE WITH ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING A TESTIMONY FOR THIS BUDGET REQUEST IS MADE ON A JOHNSON UP FROM THE NATIONAL CENTER OF YOUTH AND LAW. WHO? THAT ORGANIZATIONS ALSO A SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. WONDERFUL JOHNSON THANK YOU GOOD EVENING AT CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS ANNA JOHNSON SENIOR POLICY ASSOCIATE AT THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR YOUTH LAW AND I AM HERE TO SPEAK -- IN SUPPORT OF THIS ONE TIME BUDGET ALLOCATION OF NINE MILLION TO AUGMENT THE FOSTERING SUCCESS FUND. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN FACILITIES LOCATED IN NINETEEN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES MADE EXCESSIVE CALLS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT ON YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE. THESE FACILITIES AVERAGE CALLS EVERY SINGLE DAY SOME AVERAGE FOUR TIMES A DAY TO LAW ENFORCEMENT SOME SEVEN TIMES A CALLING THEIR CARE -- YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE IN THESE FACILITIES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY CRIMINALIZE FOR NORMAL CHILDHOOD BEHAVIOURS BEHAVIORS THAT ARE RELATED TO TRAUMA OR BEHAVIORS THAT ARE GENDER NON CONFORMING. DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTING LGBT Q. YOUTH AND YOUTH WITH DISABILITIES DISPROPORTIONATE NIGHTLY IMPACTING USE OF COLOR PARTICULARLY NATIVE YOUTH. MOST PARENTS WOULD NOT CALL THE COPS ON THEIR OWN CHILDREN ABOUT A THROWN GLASS OF WATER A POKE OF A SIBLING WITH A CANDY CANE ON A HOLIDAY OR RUNNING IN THE HOUSE. BUT FOR USE IN THESE FACILITIES SPECIFICALLY THE THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING AND THIS IS NOT JUST A SIMPLE ENCOUNTER WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AS MANY OF THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS HEARD IN THE SPECIAL YOU'RE HEARING YESTERDAY ON AB THREE NINETY TWO THIS IS A COMPLEX. RELATIONSHIP THAT THEY'RE DEALING WITH AND IT'S A FEARFUL RELATIONSHIP THAT THAT THAT THERE MAY BE -- THIS IS ACTUALLY THE BEGINNING OF FOSTER CARE TO PRISON PIPELINE. AS AS THE MEMBER MENTIONED ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON MENTIONED WHAT THIS FUND WILL DO YOU -- SO I WILL SKIP OVER THOSE POINTS THERE BUT CALIFORNIA'S ACTUALLY ALREADY BEGUN TO MOVE TOWARDS THIS HEALTH BASED APPROACH TO DEALING WITH YOUTH AND CONFLICT OF THE WITH THE LAW. INCLUDING INVESTING IN DIVERSION PROGRAMS AND TRAUMA INFORMED COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES FOR YOUTH. IN -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA MADE AT THE FIRST FOUR MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET ALLOCATION TO ESTABLISH THE FUND INSISTS BEGIN TO DEFER EAT DIVERT YOUTH IN STATE CARE AWAY FROM THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. THE DISTRIBUTION OF THESE INITIAL FUNDS IS WELL ON ITS WAY WITH CDS WITH THE APARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES RELEASING THE REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. AND TO DISTRIBUTE THOSE FUNDS CONDUCTED THROUGH A WEAPON ARE WHERE THERE WERE OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY PARTICIPANTS ACROSS THE STATE THAT TURNED OUT FOR THAT WEAPON ARE AND ARE INTERESTED IN DELIVERING THE SERVICES IN OUR COMMUNITIES. UNFORTUNATELY THAT INITIAL ALLOCATION WILL ONLY COVER ABOUT THREE TO FOUR COUNTIES OF THOSE NINETEEN WAS STATED NEED -- IF THE COUNTIES REPRESENTED ON THIS COMMITTEE ALONE WOULD EXCEED THE AMOUNT COVERED BY LAST YEAR'S ONE TIME AUGMENTATION ARE ALLOCATION. AND ARE FURTHER MORE THEY'RE COMPARING THE TWENTY SIXTEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT CALLS TO THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE THERE IS A 10% INCREASE IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CALLS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. SO WE'VE SEEN AN INCREASING TREND SO WE KNOW THAT THIS ONE TIME ALLOCATION IS -- WOULD BE VERY WELCOME IN OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT CHILDREN IN THE SYSTEM AS YOU KNOW HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS ABUSE NEGLECT AND TRAUMA. AND THOSE IN GROUP CARE ARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO CROSSING OVER AND RELYING ON POLICE TO DEAL WITH YOUTHFUL BEHAVIOR PUSHES CHILDREN INTO THE JUSTICE SYSTEM WHEN THEY ACTUALLY NEED. TRAUMA INFORMED CARE IN THEIR HOME COMMUNITY -- YOU DEVELOPMENT A DIVERSION PROGRAM IMPROVES YES BEHAVIOR AND OUTCOMES IMPROVES PUBLIC SAFETY AND IS A SMARTER INVESTMENT -- AND THIS I'M JUST GOING TO KIND OF BE QUICK HERE WITH A SKIP OVER SOME STUFF SINCE I KNOW YOU ALL KNOW THAT SO -- BY REDUCING OUR OVERLOOKED AND RELIANCE ON LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PRIORITIZING COMMUNITY BASED TIME IN FORCE FROM INFORMED CARE CALIFORNIA WILL IMPROVE LIFE OUTCOMES FOR FOSTER YOUTH. BETTER UTILIZE SCARCE LAW ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES AND IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY AND I URGE YOUR IPHONE THANK YOU. ANY FEEDBACK FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. A PICTURE RECORD FROM THE DEPARTMENT I REALLY DON'T HAVE MUCH TO ADD WE WORK CLOSELY TOGETHER AND YOU KNOW I COULD HAVE ON THE LAST ITEM THANK YOU FOR YOUR ADVOCACY AS WELL IN NON DISCUSSION PORTION OF THE AGENDA -- THERE ARE SEVERAL PROPOSALS FROM OUR OFFICE OF THE FOSTER CARE OMBUDSMAN AND A LOT OF WORK AND ON ON THE BILL OF RIGHTS AS WELL SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE ISSUE FORWARD. OBVIOUSLY REDUCING THE CRIMINALIZATION OF YOUTH AND THEIR BEHAVIORS IS A GOOD THING WE WENT ALL SUPPORT THAT -- I I WOULD SAY IT'S PROBABLY TOO EARLY TO TELL WHETHER THE MONEY THAT WAS IN THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET IS HAVING AN IMPACT OR THE IMPACT THAT WAS INTENDED OF IT. THE COMMENT THAT I'VE MADE PREVIOUSLY ABOUT YOU KNOW WHEN WE MAKE AN INVESTMENT WHAT ARE WE GETTING FOR IT WHAT WE EXPECT TO SEE FOR IT. PER SHARE THE CLARIFICATION THIS IS A ONE TIME REQUEST. THAT COMES ALONG WITH SOME CONCERNS ABOUT STARTING SOMETHING AND THEN STOPPING SOMETHING OR WHAT COMES NEXT AS THE NEXT STOP FOR THESE PROVIDERS AS THEY EXPAND THE CAPACITY. UP SO AGAIN COMING BACK TO THE HOW DO WE PROVE THAT IT WORKS SO THAT WE KNOW WHETHER WE WANT TO CONTINUE IN THE FUTURE OR NOT. SO THOSE WOULD BE SOME KINDS OF THE QUESTIONS I WOULD ADDITIONALLY NOTE -- AND COULD PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE DONE IT EARLIER THERE'S A LOT OF OVERLAP IN THE ADDRESSING OF THE ISSUES BETWEEN THE VARIOUS PROPOSALS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. YOU HEARD THP PLUS TALK ABOUT BAD CAPACITY AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF BEDS AVAILABLE. THEN WE HEARD A PROPOSAL ABOUT -- AT ADVOCATING FOR NAVIGATORS TO HELP PEOPLE FIND PLACES TO STAY HERE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HELPING THEM ACHIEVE PERMANENCY WHEN THEY'RE ALREADY IN A CONGREGATE CARE SITUATION. AND DIVERTING THEM FROM CRIMINAL JUSTICE SO THERE'S A CERTAIN PIECE TO THAT WE WOULD LIKE A PART IN THE CONVERSATION NOT JUST WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO ACHIEVE IN ARE WE GETTING AT BUT ALSO HOW DO THESE THINGS INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER SO IT'S A MORE COMPLICATED CONVERSATION. VALID ISSUE AND AGAIN FIRST THING I SAID REDUCING THE CRIMINALIZATION OF YOUTH AND THEIR BEHAVIORS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT HUMAN THING TO BE DOING. BERMAN FINANCE -- ARE JUST INTEREST FROM FINANCE ANSWERED LIKE THAT ON THE ADMINISTRATION HAS TAKEN SOME APPROACHES ON THIS I BELIEVE -- REGULATIONS WERE JUST FINALIZED IN OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN AND IT WITH -- A LOT OF THESE FACILITIES ON ADDRESS SCENE -- PICTURED COULD END IN AN EFFORT TO LIMIT THE NEED FOR CALLING LAW ENFORCEMENT SO I JUST WANT TO ADD THAT ON THERE. THANK YOU AND I THINK YOU'RE CORRECTIVE PARENTS AREN'T GOING TO CALL. POLICE LAW ENFORCEMENT TO COME AND HELP THEM. OUT. SOLVE ISSUES THAT YOU'RE RIGHT THIS THE USER TEENS AND THEY'RE ACTING OUT AND BUT ONCE THEY'RE CRIMINALIZE ONCE THEY ARE PUT INTO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THEN IT'S SO HARD TO GET THEM OUT BECAUSE THAT REMAINS WITH THEM. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS TO US. ALL RIGHT LET'S GO ON TO ISSUE NUMBER. SIX THAT'S NOT. THAT'S NOT YET [inaudible] DAVID DEMOING [inaudible] SHE ISSUE NUMBER SIX ADDRESSING THE IMPACT OF MANDATED STATE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE. FOR FOSTER FAMILY AGENCIES. ADVOCACY PROPOSAL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO TO BE HERE. MY NAME AGAIN IS DAVID DOWN WHEN I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION FOSTER FAMILY AGENCY THAT PROVIDES A ADOPTIONS AND FOSTER CARE SERVICES. AT LEAST FOR OUR AGENCY IN ANY GIVEN YEAR WE SERVE ABOUT A THOUSAND FOSTER CHILDREN. ARE PRIMARILY CHILDREN OF COLOR AND MINORITIES. I I WANT TO FIRST SAY THAT WE APPLIED. THE COMMITMENT FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR. TO INCREASE THE WAGES AWFUL WORKERS BY RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE I THINK THAT'S A POSITIVE. FOR ALL THE WORKERS SEEN IN CALIFORNIA. I'M HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TO OUR BUDGET REQUEST THAT DEALS WITH THE IMPACT. THAT THE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES ON THE ABILITY OF THE NONPROFIT SUCH AS THE ONE THAT I WORKED WITH. TO PAY OUR SOCIAL WORKERS. THE STATE SAID IF A FAIR RATES FOR SOCIAL WORKERS HAVE BEEN FROZEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND ONE AND WERE CUT 10% IN. TWO THOUSAND NINE WE SAW A SLIGHT INCREASE OUR THREE YEARS AGO. BUT NOTHING CLOSE ENOUGH TO COVER THE COST OF INCREASING SOCIAL WORKER SALARIES. I THINK YOU KNOW WE ALL AGREE THAT SOCIAL WORKERS ARE GREAT ADVOCATES AND MENTORS WERE OUR FOSTER CHILDREN. IN THE SYSTEM. MAKING MATTERS WORSE FOR IF A FACE. THE STATE LAW REQUIRES THE EXAM PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYEES BE PAID DOUBLE THE MINIMUM WAGE. WHILE THE MINIMUM WAGE ACT MANDATES ANNUAL INCREASES TO THE STATE'S MINIMUM WEIGHT. FFA RAID DID NOT COVER THE COST OF PAYING OUR SOCIAL WORKERS DOUBLE THAT MINIMUM WAGE. NOT SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO DO WE DO WITH AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE FUNDING SOURCES. AND WE DON'T SEE ANY RATE INCREASES. IN THE NEAR FUTURE. I THERE'S ONLY TWO STATE SET FOSTER RATES AT THE NOT REESE WHO RECEIVE A MANUAL ADJUSTMENT. ONE IS THE FAA RATE AND SADLY THE OTHER ONE NEEDS FOR INFANT CARE SUPPLEMENT. TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE WITH THE LAW. WE'RE ASKING THAT THE BUDGET ALLOCATION OF TWENTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND THOUSAND TWENTY ANY FURTHER INCREASE OF FFA RATES AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH SUBSEQUENT CALENDAR YEAR. AT THE LESSER OF THREE POINT FIVE OF THE CHANGE IN THE US CONSUMER PRICE INDEX. AS YOU KNOW IF IT FOR YOU PROVIDE CARE SUPPORT AND SERVICES FOR NEARLY THIRTEEN THOUSAND CHILDREN. SOME 25% OF THOSE KIDS IN CALIFORNIA ARE IN FOSTER CARE. IF A FACE ARE CRITICAL TO SUCCESS WILL IMPLEMENT THE STATE'S CONTIENEN WITH CARE REFORM. THAT SIGNATURE HOME BASE FAMILY CARE FOR EVERY CHILD IN FOSTER CARE. WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR BRING IN FFA SOCIAL WORKER SALARIES INTO COMPLIANCE. WITH THE NEW STATE MINIMUM WAGE LAW. THANK YOU THANK YOU WITH THIS SOUNDS LIKE A TOTALLY LOGICAL -- REQUEST. ALMOST SEEMS LIKE -- IT MAY HAVE BEEN OVERLOOKED FOR WHATEVER REASON. IS A FOR INCREASING THE MINIMUM WAGE WE HAVE TO PROVIDE THE FUNDING -- THAT GOES WITH THAT. OF IT ANY THAT IS THE DSS SERGIO OUT HAVE [inaudible] COMMENTS. YEAH I THINK YOU HEARD ME SAY THAT ARE ANXIOUS AS HEARING THE GOOD OUTCOMES FOR THE PEOPLE WERE CARRYING FOUR DEPENDS IN PART ON A STABLE AND THUS PROPERLY COMPENSATED WORK FORCE -- AND THIS IS ONE OF THE RATES SAYS AS MENTIONED THAT DOESN'T AUTO ADJUST FOR CHANGES IN MINIMUM WAGE THE DEFINITION OF IT IS AS HE DESCRIBED IF IF YOU'RE A PROFESSIONAL BY WAGE ORDER NUMBER FOR YOUR YOUR WAIT A YEAR WAGE MUST BE DOUBLE THE THE MINIMUM WAGE. AND AND WHILE WE ARE WHERE WE'RE AT TODAY WERE ALSO ON A PASSED TO TO FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR -- AT A FUTURE POINT IN TIME -- SOME FFA IS ARE ABLE TO MEET THAT STANDARD TODAY UNDER THEIR RATE -- OTHERS ARE NOT WE UNDERSTAND THE RANGE OF WAGES IS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWENTY THREE AND THIRTY DOLLARS AN HOUR FOR THESE FOLKS THESE ARE PEOPLE WITH MASTERS DEGREES AND SOCIAL WORK -- AND SO YOU KNOW THAT SHOULD THAT SHOULD WEIGH IN THEIR AT THE END OF THE DAY. AND IF WE CONTINUE TO CLASSIFY THEM AS A PROFESSIONAL WHICH WHICH IS THE MOST PEOPLE WOULD AGREE THAT THEY ARE -- THEN THE WAGE ORDER IS IS PRETTY CLEAR THAT THERE WHICH NEEDS TO BE DOUBLE MINIMUM WAGE. WONDERFUL THANK YOU [inaudible] BERMAN FINANCE [inaudible] HELLO. I I DO WANT TO JUST COMMENT THAT -- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOCIAL WORKERS THERE ARE. OBVIOUSLY MANY HERE YESTERDAY AND TODAY AND THEIR WORK IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. THIS FIELD AND SO MANY OTHER FEELS AND I I THANK YOU -- BY MY SISTER REMINDS ME THAT IT'S SHE HAS A DOCTOR AND SOCIAL WORK THIS REMINDS ME THAT SOCIAL WORKERS ARE REALLY THE ONES WHO DO THE WORK YEAH. THAT THE REST OF US JUST TALK ABOUT IT BUT THE SOCIAL WORKERS TO IT. SO IN HONOR OF MY SISTER ROSA. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THAT CONCLUDES SOME ISSUE NUMBER SIX WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER. SEVEN CHILD WELFARE PUBLIC HEALTH NURSING.

EACH MONTH OVER ELEVEN THOUSAND CALLS IN LA COUNTY REPORT IS A BIT SUSPECTED CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES DO. DO NOT GO OUT ON EVERY REFERRAL. WE GO OUT ON CALLS THAT COME FROM MULTIPLE PROVIDERS FROM HOSPITALS CLINICS SCHOOLS OR WHEN THE SOCIAL WORKER. HAS DETERMINED THAT THE SUPPLEMENTAL HEALTH ASSESSMENT BY PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES NECESSARY I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE A FEW STORIES WITH YOU TO ILLUSTRATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ROLE THE PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE PLATE IN THE TOWER FOR ASSISTANCE. I HAD A SIX YEAR OLD CHILD WHO WAS NOT THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THE REFERRAL THE MOTHER HAD SEVEN TWO CHILDREN THE CHILD WITH A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE POUNDS. THE CHAO HAD A TRAIT DUE TO MORBID OBESITY N. SLEEP APNEA WHEN I WENT TO THE HOME AND DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS HE TANKS WHICH OXYGEN TANK THAT WAS LEFT NEXT TO THE HEATER. ALSO THAT THE CHILD HAS NOT BEEN FOLLOWED UP ON THE WITH THE PULLMAN KNOWLEDGES THAT MANAGES THE TRADE FOR OVER A YEAR THE MOTHER THROUGH ALL THE SUPPLIES IN THE CLOSET.

SEVERE HIGHS CONTINUOUSLY FROM MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED TO SIXTEEN HUNDRED CELLS ABLE TO SHOW THAT THAT FAMILY THAT IF THEY GO ON CHECK AT THE INSULIN IF THE BLOOD SUGAR IS UNCHECKED AND NOT COVER. THE NO CHILD THE BLOOD SUGAR WILL KEEP GOING UP IN THE CHAO COULD POSSIBLY DIE. SO WHAT DO TO MY DILIGENCE I RECOMMENDED THAT THE FAMILY ALSO GO BACK INTO THE ENDOCRINOLOGIST TO BE RETESTED ON HOW TO MANAGE THE DIABETES REGIMENT WHICH IS STILL SO IMPORTANT. ALSO OF THAT IMPACT IF WE WERE IF I WAS ABLE TO GO IN SOONER. LIKE THE ONE WITH THE TRICK THEY'RE NOT PREVENTED THE CHILD FROM BEING DETAINED AND KEPT THE CHILD IN THE HOME WITH THE DIABETIC PATIENTS. I WAS ABLE TO SO FAR KEEP THE CHILD IN THE HOME DUE TO THE SERVICE CONNECTIONS AND THEN ALSO TO DO A FOLLOW UP VISIT. TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING THAT I HAD SUGGESTED IN RECOMMENDED THAT IS IN PLACE AND THAT THEY ARE FOLLOWING IN FOLLOWING THE DIABETIC A PROPER REGIMENT PRO THE DOCTOR'S ORDERS SO THEN I WILL MAKE THAT DETERMINATION AT THAT TIME. TO PREVENT THE CHILD FROM BEING REMOVED FROM THE HOME WE LIKE TO KEEP THE FAMILIES TOGETHER. SO PROVIDING THE APPROPRIATE SUPPORT PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES LINK FAMILIES TO PREVENTATIVE IN INTERVENTIONAL HEALTH SERVICES. TO AT RISK CHILDREN BEFORE CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS BECOME LIFE THREATENING PROTECTING CHILDREN. THE TECHNICIAN WITHIN AGAINST UNNECESSARY HELP THE CLIENT AND THE WARNING CHILD FATALITY. SO AS YOU CAN SEE THE FIRST EXAMPLE THAT I THAT I HAD MENTIONED I SAY THAT CHILD'S LIFE. SO PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES ARE WE WE HAVE THAT UNIQUE SKILL TO WHERE WE CAN ASSESS THE CHAO FROM HEAD TO TOE AND DETERMINE WHAT IS NEEDED IN THE TYPE OF SERVICES FOR THAT CHILD. SOME OPEN IT TO SUPPORT OUR OF EARLY INTERVENTION PILOT PROGRAM OF EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION. WITH A FEDERAL MATCH OF THE EIGHT POINT. TWO FIVE I JUST HAD TO COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS. ONE IS THAT IT'S LA COUNTY AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALMOST AND I ARE IN SAN BERNADINO. SECONDS THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE YOU I'VE GOT. TO I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU THAT -- I JUST IN THE WAY THAT YOU PRESENT THIS -- IT IS CLEAR THAT YOU ARE DEDICATED TO THIS ABSOLUTE AND WHEN WE HAVE DEDICATED -- TO PEOPLE SUCH AS YOURSELF IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE TO LISTEN -- YOU YOU ARE DOING THE WORK. JUST AS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER WE TALKING TO THE FOSTER YOUTH THAT'S IMPORTANT OVER TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY DOING THE WORK NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT IT. I THANK YOU I UNDERSTAND ALSO BECAUSE THAT WAS ONE OF MY QUESTIONS Y. LA COUNTY WHY SO MUCH FOR JUST ONE COUNTY. WERE UNDERSTAND LA COUNTY AS ONE THIRD. OF ALL THE CASELOAD FOR THE STATE OF CALLAHAN'S A LITTLE BIT THERE'S SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND FOSTER YOUTH IN CALIFORNIA ALONE AND LA COUNTY HAS. TWENTY THOUSAND SO WE'RE HUGE COUNTY YES YOU ARE -- IF WE COULD GET THE PILOT GOING IN AND THEN EVENTUALLY IF I COULD TO ONLY DISCREDIT STATEWIDE ABSOLUTE ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT SEVEN GET OR OR LOOK AT SOME TYPE OF PILOT PROGRAM -- IN BOTH AREAS I THINK ON A ON A DIFFERENT SCALES. SINCE WE'RE THE ONLY ONES LEFT. RIGHT NOW YEAH YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW COUNTY REMAINS THE LARGEST COUNTY WITH WITH THE GREAT GREAT NEED THIS OVERLOOKED ALSO COUNTY AND WE HAVE MULTIPLE COMPLEXES BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SOCIAL ECONOMICS AND ALSO THEY'RE NOT. ALWAYS EDUCATED A LOT ON THE BELOW SIX GRADE LEVEL SO THERE'S A LOT OF EXTRA THINGS THAT WE HAD TO DO AN AUDIT TAKE CARE OF OUR ANOTHER REASON WHY SHOULD BE A PILOT PROGRAM IN BOTH COUNTIES. IS BECAUSE A LOT OF THE MEMBERS AND CLIENTS TO DO -- TRAVEL ON BECAUSE IT'S SO CLOSE FROM LA COUNTY IN DECEMBER YOU KNOW COUNTY SO IT COULD BE SERVING THE SAME FOLDED STARED JUST A A FOOD FOR THOUGHT. AND IF WE KEEP TALKING WILL DAVID GIVE YOU EVER REASON POSSIBLE. THE HOUSING IS LESS EXPENSIVE SO WE KNOW THAT. THAT LA COUNTY HI THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT BUT THE POPULATION DOES CONTINUE. TO MOVE DOESN'T SEE COUNTY LINES IT SEES THE NEED GOING. AND EVERYWHERE THIS NEED IT SO WE WOULD -- AVIC OUR IN OUR ADVOCATING FOR A PILOT PROGRAM ALSO ASSEMBLY NO COUNTY. WE GOT TO GET WATER LA FOR FOR YOU GUYS BUT BECAUSE THEY ONLY COUNTIES HAS THE ONE THIRD OF THE FOSTER USE. IF WE CAN GET THAT PILOT GOING TO NAIL BEEN CORRECTED AND THEN WE CAN DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE OF THE COUNTIES I THINK. YOU'LL PROBABLY BE HAPPY ABOUT THAT BECAUSE YOU WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE ONE LITTLE BUGS AND DIFFERENT THINGS OTHER PROBLEMS BUT ENOUGH. IT IS DEFINITELY THERE IS A NEED FOR THAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH MS HARRIS -- IT ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. THE ADMINISTRATION ONE MORE PLUG FOR SAN BENITO COUNTY YES THERE. IS THERE A I WOULD GREG ROSE TO THE DEPARTMENT I JUST AS A SOCIAL WORKER MYSELF CLEARLY THE THAT THE SKILL SET FROM THE PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE -- IS IS -- IS DIFFERENT AND OFTEN COMPLEMENTARY AND I WOULD JUST SUGGEST SUGGEST THAT IF THE IF THIS IS A PRIORITY THAT WE COULD WE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE IMPLEMENTATION WORK WITH ON IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES. WONDERFUL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS HER THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. ALL RIGHT LET'S MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT CONTINUATION OF BRINGING FAMILIES HOME -- FRANK MECCA FEEL. TO THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FRANK MECCA EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CWD A I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF MY ORGANIZATION THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING AND HOUSING CALIFORNIA. AMR SEEKING TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND FOR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY IN. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO CONTINUE AND EXPAND THE BRINGING FAMILIES HOME PROGRAM. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN OR COALITION ADVOCATED FOR THE CREATION OF BRINGING FAMILIES HOME PROGRAM. BASED ON WHAT WE SAW WITH THE GROWING CONCERN IN CALIFORNIA OVER THE LINK BETWEEN CHILD WELFARE INVOLVEMENT AND HOMELESSNESS AMONG FAMILIES. AT THE TIME NATIONAL DATA INDICATED ABOUT ONE THIRD OF CHILD OFFER INVOLVE FAMILIES WERE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. AND MORE HOMELESSNESS BUT CAN NOT IN AND OF ITSELF BE A BASIS FOR REMOVAL THERE'S ABSOLUTELY A LINK BETWEEN REFERRALS TO CPS. AND HOMELESSNESS. AND EVEN MORE COMMON FAMILIES HAVE COMPLIED WITH COURT ORDERS AND RULES OR OTHERWISE READY TO REUNIFY WE KNOW ARE NOT BEING REUNIFIED BECAUSE JUDGES ARE LOATH. TO REUNIFY CHILDREN TO THE STREETS. I'M IN SO WE LITERALLY HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THEIR CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE FOR NO OTHER REASON. BUT FOR THE FACT THAT THEIR PARENTS CAN'T FIND SAFE AND AFFORDABLE PLACE TO LIVE. AND SO THE BRINGING FAMILIES HOME PROGRAM WAS CREATED AS A DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM THE TRAILER BILL. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IT USES THE HOUSING FIRST MODEL AN EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTIONS. THAT WE'VE SEEN SUCCESSFULLY WORK IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN THE COUNTRY. COUNTY AGENCIES COLLABORATE TO OFFER HOUSING SUPPORTS. RENT RENTAL ASSISTANCE FIRST AND LAST MONTH'S HOUSING MODIFICATIONS FOR EXAMPLE -- TO ALLOW FOR SUCCESSFUL REUNIFICATION OF CHILDREN WITH THEIR FAMILIES ACCORDING TO THE S. S. IS DATA. BETWEEN THE START UP IN FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IN JUST OVER ONE YEAR OF OPERATION THE PROGRAM IS PERMANENTLY HOUSE FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR FAMILIES. WHICH IS ALREADY EXCEEDING BUT FIVE HUNDRED FAMILY GOAL THAT WE ORIGINALLY SET FOR THE PROGRAM. AND DURING THE COURSE OF THE DEMONSTRATION WE'VE ALSO GAIN BETTER DATA ABOUT THE LINK BETWEEN HOMELESSNESS AND CHILD WELFARE INVOLVEMENT. ARE COUNTIES FOR EXAMPLE REPORTING NOW THAT HALF OF CHILD WHILE BROOMBALL FAMILIES ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS -- SO FUNDING FOR THE EXISTING DEMONSTRATION IS SET TO EXPIRE ON JUNE THIRTIETH AND SOAP WILL WE WILL BE TAKING NO MORE REFERRALS -- IN THE TWELVE COUNTIES THAT ARE PART OF THE DEMONSTRATION -- WE ALSO KNOW THAT ONLY IN JUST THE TWELVE COUNTIES THAT ARE DEMONSTRATING BRINGING FAMILIES HOME THEIR FIVE HUNDRED IS TIONAL FAMILIES THAT ARE DETERMINED ELIGIBLE BUT ARE WAITING BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE. THE RESOURCES -- WE ALSO KNOW THAT IT'S PART OF THE DEMONSTRATION DSS WAS TASKED WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF COLLECTING DATA AND REPORTING ON THE OUTCOMES AND WE KNOW THAT THAT THAT THAT WORK IS IN PROCESS. BUT CLEARLY THE EARLY RESULTS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THAT THE REPORTS WERE MY MEMBERS INDICATE THAT THIS IS AN EXTREMELY COST EFFECTIVE AND BENEFICIAL PROGRAM AND SO WE'RE REQUESTING. THAT THE PROGRAM BE RE AUTHORIZED FOR TWO MORE YEARS AND BE INCREASED TWENTY FIVE MILLION. SO THAT WE CAN BOTH EXPAND. THE DEMONSTRATION WITHIN THE EXISTING COUNTIES BUT ALSO EXPAND TO NEW COUNTIES WHICH I SHOULD SAY IS SORT OF THE ARK THAT THE LEGISLATURE. TRUCK WHEN IT CREATED AND THEN EXPANDED THE COW WORKS HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM WHICH THIS IS IN SOME WAY MODELED AFTER. WONDERFUL THANK YOU. COMMENTS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. PERHAPS IT'S A SIGN OF OUR CLOSE COLLABORATION ON THIS OF MISTER MECCA STOLE ALL MY STATISTICS. WELL TO BE FAIR -- WE STOLE THEM FROM PETE'S STAFF THE YOU KNOW THE THINGS THAT I'VE SAID THE OF A HE NOTED THE EVALUATION WON'T BE DONE UNTIL NEXT YEAR. I WOULD ADD IN ADDITION TO THE FACT THAT IT'S FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR FAMILIES THAT HAVE SO FAR BEEN REUNIFIED THAT'S TWELVE HUNDRED KIDS. JUST TO ADD THAT NUMBER IN THERE. AND FROM A PROGRAM OPERATIONS STANDPOINT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT ALTHOUGH IT'S EXACTLY RIGHT THIS WAS A ONE TIME THREE MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM WITH AN EVALUATION COMPONENT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT PROGRAMMATIC LEE TO TO RUN SOMETHING STOP IT AND RESTART IT IF THAT DECISION IS MADE TO RESTART. ADDITIONALLY I'D NOTE THAT WHEN YOU REUNIFY FAMILY WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THIS HEARING ON ISSUE ONE ON C. C. R. WHEN YOU RE UNIFY THESE ARE KIDS THAT DON'T NEED A RESOURCE FAMILY BECAUSE THEIR WITH THEIR FAMILIES. SO AGAIN ALL THESE THINGS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY HAVE A RELATIONSHIP IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH EACH OTHER. SO -- SHIP [inaudible] THANK YOU. IS THERE FOLLOW UP THAT'S DONE WITH THE FAMILIES TO SEE IF THE PLACEMENT HAS BEEN PERMANENT AND SO THESE THESE ARE FAMILY THERE ACTUALLY ARE UNDER COURT SUPERVISION -- EITHER VOLUNTARILY OR OR THROUGH A PETITION BEING FILED SO. ON THE DECISION TO REUNIFY HAS TO BE APPROVED BY THE JUDGE. AND SO THE JUDGE WOULD SAY THAT THIS IS A FAMILY THAT'S REMOVED ALL OF THE SAFETY CONCERNS. DAVE COMPLIED WITH EVERYTHING THAT WE REQUIRED AND AND I THE JUDGE I'M READY. TO TO ORDER REUNIFICATION BUT FOR THE FACT. THAT THE PARENTS DON'T HAVE A SAFE AND AFFORDABLE PLACE TO LIVE AND SO -- THAT THE CONDITIONS FOR REUNIFICATION I E. THAT THE CHILD WILL BE SAFE WITH THAT FAMILY. IN THIS CASE HAVE ALREADY BEEN MATT AND ARE CERTIFIED TO BY THE JUDGE BEFORE THEY WOULD ISSUE THE REUNIFICATION ORDER. WHAT WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF? FUNDING IS A PROVIDED. KIDS WILL STAY IN FOSTER CARE LONGER. AND PARENTS WHO SHOULD BE WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND CHILDREN WHO SHOULD BE WITH THEIR PARENTS WERE BOTH SUFFER THE TRAUMA OF BEING SEPARATED. BRITAIN BUT FOR THE ONLY REASON BEING THE FACT THAT HOUSING IS SOEXPENSIVE AND SO DIFFICULT TO FIND. AND THEY NEED HELP WITH IT AND THE CURRENT SYSTEM WAS NEVER BUILT. TO PROVIDE HOUSING SUPPORTS AS PART OF THE REUNIFICATION MILIEU THANK YOU. YOUR AVAILABLE SPACE WHICH OF PLEASE DO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF LET'S GO TO ISSUE NUMBER NINE OUR LAST ISSUE. WE HAVE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF ANY TABLE ALREADY -- C. W. S. TRAINING AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT YES WHAT WE'RE HERE ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS AND SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION. AND WE'RE SEEKING TEN MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND FOR DSS NOT FOR COUNTIES. AND IT'S FOR DSS. TO AUGMENT THE EXISTING CHILD WELFARE TRAINING THAT THEY PROVIDE TO OUR WORKERS. THIS -- INVESTMENT WOULD LEVERAGE TWELVE ADDITIONAL MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO READ THE RESULT IN TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN REALIGNMENT AND SH THAT SHIFTED THE RESPONSIBILITY OF TRAVEL FOR THE COUNTIES. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF FUNCTIONS THAT WERE NOT REALIGNED AND TRAINING WITH ONE OF THEM. THE BELIEF AT THE TIME AND I THINK IT'S THOUGH IF IT'S THE RIGHT BELIEF WAS THAT FOR PURPOSES OF ENSURING CONSISTENCY. AND ACHIEVING ECONOMIES OF SCALE THAT THE STATE SHOULD BE THE PROVIDER OF TRAINING IN THE STATE HAS A ROBUST INFRASTRUCTURE. THE REGIONAL TRAINING ACADEMY SO SORT OF IF IT'S NOT BROKE LET'S NOT TRY TO FIX THAT. THE TRAINING WITH CAP WITH THE STATE. UNFORTUNATELY THAT FUNDING FOR STATE TRAINING HAS NOT KEPT PACE WITH THE MAJOR CHANGES IN THE PROGRAM IN RECENT YEARS. YOU'VE HEARD ALL ABOUT C. C. R. YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT EXTENDED FOSTER CARE CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMING THE KD ES. SETTLEMENT FOR EXAMPLE. WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FEDERALLY REQUIRED PROGRAM IMPROVEMENT PLAN THAT REQUIRES THAT WE IMPROVE OUR PRACTICE AND ONE OF THE METHODOLOGIES FOR DOING THAT. IS IS BETTER TRAINING -- SO THEY'RE ALL THESE IMPERATIVES TO ENHANCE THE TRAINING AND AND IT REALLY HAS SORT OF NOT KEPT UP WITH SORT OF LANGUISHED AND SO WE'RE ASKING FOR THIS -- AUGMENTATION FOR THE STATE TO ENHANCE ITS CONTRACTS WITH THE REGIONAL TRAINING ACADEMIES TO PROVIDE -- THAT. MORE TRAINING FOR THE REASONS THAT I'VE MENTIONED BUT ALSO SOME OTHER ENHANCEMENTS TRAINING OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM LIKE WITH PEERS SO THAT THEIR OTHER MODALITIES OF LEARNING. TRAINING FOR SUPERVISORS BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT SUPERVISION IS AS IMPORTANT. TO OUTCOMES AS AS THE WORK OF THE LINE -- CASE WORKER. TRAINING FOR SPECIALTY POPULATIONS CHILDREN WHO'VE BEEN COMMERCIALLY SEXUALLY EXPLOITED -- FOR EXAMPLE AND IS ALSO -- A PROVISION IN OUR REQUEST TO ALLOW FOR THE GATHERING ABOUT COME DATA TO SEE IF THE TRAINING IS ACTUALLY IMPROVING THE PRACTICE -- AND SO -- THAT IS THE BASIS FOR A REQUEST AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION IN THE LEGISLATURE. ON THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IN THE MORE MORE SPECIFICS TO OPERATIONALIZE OUR REQUEST. WONDERFUL THANK YOU. ANY COMMENTS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. ON PAIN OF ECHOING MISTER MACKEY YET AGAIN YOU KNOW HE'S RIGHT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TRYING TO CHANGES IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM -- UP TO THIS POINT UP TO THIS POINT THE APPROACH HAS BEEN RE PRIORITIZING THE EXISTING TRAINING BUDGETS WHEN WE LOOK AT UPDATING CURRICULUM AND SO FORTH. WE HEAR HIM SAY ON ON BEHALF OF HIS MEMBERS WHO ARE DOING THE WORK THAT MORE IS NEEDED. AND HE ALREADY TOUCHED ON OTHER THINGS I WOULD SAY WE WANT THE TRAINING TO REFLECT MODERN PROVEN APPROACHES REUSABLE CONTENT PROMOTE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES. FIELD BASED FOLLOW ON TRAININGS HE MENTIONED SUPERVISOR TRAINING -- SPECIALTY POPULATIONS NEW TOPICS FOR FOR FOR THOSE -- AND APPRECIATE THE COMMENT AS WELL ABOUT COLLECTING OUTCOME DATA YOU'VE HEARD ME TALK ALL DAY TODAY THAT WHEN WE INVEST IN SOMETHING WE WANT TO KNOW WHETHER WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WORKING WHETHER WE'RE GETTING WHAT WE EXPECTED. YOU KNOW ALL AND MAYBE THE FINAL COMMENT THERE ARE A COUPLE THINGS YOU NEVER HEAR AND ONE OF THEM IS MY RATE IS TOO HIGH. AND THE OTHER THAT YOU NEVER HEAR IS I'M OVER TRAINED.
