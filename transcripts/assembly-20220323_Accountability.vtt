I AM. I AM ACTUALLY THRILLED TO

PRESENT TODAY. ALTHOUGH I'VE HAD

00:32:27.512 --> 00:32:29.380
I DO KNOW THE BILL HAS DRAWN

00:32:29.447 --> 00:32:30.014
SOME OPPOSITION BUT I ACTUALLY

00:32:30.081 --> 00:32:32.550
THINK. HONESTLY I'VE I'VE IS

00:32:32.617 --> 00:32:34.686
WITH MY- COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER

00:32:34.752 --> 00:32:36.421
SIDE OF THIS CONVERSATION. AND I

00:32:36.487 --> 00:32:38.990
BELIEVE THIS IS A SORT OF BILL

00:32:39.057 --> 00:32:39.590
THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE

00:32:39.657 --> 00:32:43.461
PASSING BY ACCLAMATION. AND I

00:32:43.528 --> 00:32:45.596
DEFINITELY DO NOT THINK FOR A

00:32:45.663 --> 00:32:47.632
LOT OF REASONS. THAT TO ASK

00:32:47.699 --> 00:32:51.803
STATE AGENCIES. ONE TIME TO LOOK

00:32:51.869 --> 00:32:55.173
BASS BACK ACROSS THE THIRTEEN

00:32:55.239 --> 00:32:56.407
THOUSAND FOURTEEN THOUSAND PAGES

00:32:56.474 --> 00:32:57.575
OF REGULATIONS AND CONSIDER

00:32:57.642 --> 00:32:59.410
WHETHER SOMETHING IN THEIR IN

00:32:59.477 --> 00:33:01.913
THEIR BAILIWICK MAYBE OUTDATED

00:33:01.979 --> 00:33:04.615
INCONSISTENT DUPLICATIVE. IS

00:33:04.682 --> 00:33:08.052
ASTONISHING. WE ARE HOWEVER THE

00:33:08.119 --> 00:33:09.921
ONE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT THAT

00:33:09.987 --> 00:33:12.357
CONSTANTLY RENEWS ITSELF THE

00:33:12.423 --> 00:33:14.559
EXECUTIVE BRANCH CONTINUES THE

00:33:14.625 --> 00:33:16.828
COURTS CONTINUE BUT OUR BRANCH

00:33:16.894 --> 00:33:18.796
OF GOVERNMENT EVERY TWO YEARS WE

00:33:18.863 --> 00:33:21.432
RENEW OURSELVES. AND AS A PART

00:33:21.499 --> 00:33:23.301
OF THAT WE STAND DURING THE

00:33:23.368 --> 00:33:25.203
CHAMBERS. WE STAND UP IN YOUR

00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:27.739
WHICH ARE COUNTY IS CALLED. AND

00:33:27.805 --> 00:33:28.906
WE TAKE THAT BASE THAT MOST

00:33:28.973 --> 00:33:31.809
VULNERABLE. I DO SOLEMNLY SWEAR

00:33:31.876 --> 00:33:33.911
TO SUPPORT. ATTORNEY TALK ABOUT

00:33:33.978 --> 00:33:35.613
DEFENDING SUPPORT THE

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.082
CONSTITUTION. AND THERE'S

00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:39.117
NOTHING MORE BASIC IN THE

00:33:39.183 --> 00:33:41.586
CONSTITUTION AND THAT WE ARE THE

00:33:41.652 --> 00:33:43.020
REPRESENT A BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT

00:33:43.087 --> 00:33:46.824
. THAT HOLDS THE PEOPLE'S CHARGE

00:33:46.891 --> 00:33:51.095
. AND I FEEL THAT. I HAVE HAD

00:33:51.162 --> 00:33:53.331
THIS BILL FOR A NUMBER OF TIMES

00:33:53.398 --> 00:33:57.869
. BUT TOOK TO ME IT'S LIKE HOW

00:33:57.935 --> 00:34:00.204
CAN WE LOOK AROUND THE GLOBE AND

00:34:00.271 --> 00:34:02.573
NOT FEEL DEMOCRACY IS THREATENED

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.409
. EVEN OUR OWN NATION WE KNOW.

00:34:04.475 --> 00:34:08.112
THE DEEP DIVISIONS THAT EXIST.

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:10.348
SO HOW DO WE HAVING TAKEN

00:34:10.415 --> 00:34:12.984
THAT'LL- CONCEIVABLE WAY TO TELL

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:16.621
PEOPLE IN OUR STATE THAT OUR

00:34:16.687 --> 00:34:18.956
DEMOCRACY IS NOT BROKEN. THAT

00:34:19.023 --> 00:34:20.992
THERE IS A PATH IN THE STATE

00:34:21.058 --> 00:34:22.827
CAPITAL THAT THE SYSTEM IS OPEN

00:34:22.894 --> 00:34:25.563
TO PEOPLE. THEY WANT THE WINDOW

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:26.931
OPEN LET THE BREEZE BLOW. YOU

00:34:26.998 --> 00:34:31.536
KNOW GOVERNMENT CANNOT LIVE BY

00:34:31.602 --> 00:34:36.140
THE CREDO. COME WE'LL OR WILL

00:34:36.207 --> 00:34:38.910
OUR STATUS IS QUO. THAT'S NOT

00:34:38.976 --> 00:34:41.979
WHAT WE CAN BE ABOUT. IT'S NOT

00:34:42.046 --> 00:34:43.181
WHAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE

00:34:43.247 --> 00:34:49.353
ABOUT. TO MY CORE I BELIEVE THIS

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:52.356
BILL IS REASONABLE IF I WOULD

00:34:52.423 --> 00:34:54.792
SAY IF THERE IS A ONE MAN- I

00:34:54.859 --> 00:34:56.627
WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED IN

00:34:56.694 --> 00:34:58.029
TALKING ABOUT. IT UP THIS BILL

00:34:58.096 --> 00:34:59.430
SAYS EVERY AGENCIES SHALL LOOK

00:34:59.497 --> 00:35:01.532
BACK FOR THE SNOW CLASS OF A-

00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:02.700
REGULATIONS OUTDATED DUPLICATIVE

00:35:02.767 --> 00:35:06.270
INCONSISTENT. THEY WILL HOLD A

00:35:06.337 --> 00:35:07.939
HEARING AND LET THE PEOPLE

00:35:08.005 --> 00:35:09.640
COMMENT ON THAT SO THEY'RE OPEN

00:35:09.707 --> 00:35:12.109
THE DOOR LED TO R. PARTIS POURED

00:35:12.176 --> 00:35:13.978
PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY

00:35:14.045 --> 00:35:15.847
PARTICIPATE. THEY'RE GONNA

00:35:15.913 --> 00:35:17.582
RICHARD REPORT THE LEGISLATURE

00:35:17.648 --> 00:35:18.850
TO THE RELEVANT STANDING

00:35:18.916 --> 00:35:21.152
COMMITTEES INFORMING THEM OF

00:35:21.219 --> 00:35:23.454
SUGGESTED CHANGES. THERE'S A

00:35:23.521 --> 00:35:24.856
THIRTY DAY WINDOW ON THAT REPORT

00:35:24.922 --> 00:35:27.658
BEFORE THEY CAN ACT. WE MIGHT

00:35:27.725 --> 00:35:28.726
SAY THAT IT SHOULD BE LONGER

00:35:28.793 --> 00:35:31.028
THAN THIRTY DAYS. IT WAS DONE

00:35:31.095 --> 00:35:31.996
THE BOOK FOR TEN YEARS I WOULD

00:35:32.063 --> 00:35:33.231
THINK THERE'S SOME INCONSISTENCY

00:35:33.297 --> 00:35:36.067
ONE A LOT OF THE SIXTIES WHEN A

00:35:36.133 --> 00:35:37.301
LOT OF THE NINETY DAYS SO THE

00:35:37.368 --> 00:35:38.336
COMMITTEES CAN ACTUALLY FOCUS ON

00:35:38.402 --> 00:35:40.071
THAT. AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE A

00:35:40.137 --> 00:35:40.905
STAKE IN WHETHER THAT'S A RIGHT

00:35:40.972 --> 00:35:42.907

LEGISLATURE RESPONSE- BUT I

00:35:48.813 --> 00:35:53.084
DEFINITELY FEEL THAT THIS BILL.

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:55.152

CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU AND ALL

OF YOUR COLLEAGUES FOR WORKING

00:36:40.898 --> 00:36:43.100
TO RE INVIGORATE THE PRINCIPLE.

00:36:43.167 --> 00:36:45.403
A PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY. SELF

00:36:45.469 --> 00:36:49.540
GOVERNMENT LET'S NOT BE AN

00:36:49.607 --> 00:36:50.875
ABSTRACT IDEAL BUT MUST BE A

00:36:50.942 --> 00:36:53.010
REALITY. AND WE MUST BE

00:36:53.077 --> 00:36:55.513
UNCEASING AND OUR EFFORTS TO

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.348
MAKE IT MORE EFFECTIVE AND

00:36:57.415 --> 00:36:59.417
RESPECTED BY OUR PEOPLE.

00:36:59.483 --> 00:37:01.018
COLLEAGUES I LOOK AT THIS BILL

00:37:01.085 --> 00:37:04.722
JUST SAYS A ONE TIME LOOK. FOR

00:37:04.789 --> 00:37:06.857
THINGS OF A VERY NARROW CLASS.

00:37:06.924 --> 00:37:08.793
TO SEE IF THEY MIGHT BE UPDATED.

00:37:08.859 --> 00:37:12.363
TO MORE FOR. ACCURATELY REFLECT

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:15.032
THE HOW THE WHOLE SYSTEM WORK

00:37:15.099 --> 00:37:17.535
THIS TO ME IS JUST A STRATEGY

00:37:17.602 --> 00:37:19.403
FOR THE LEGISLATURE THIS

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:21.439
CONTINUALLY RENEWING INSTITUTION

00:37:21.505 --> 00:37:23.341
TO TAKE A STEP TO MAKE OUR

00:37:23.407 --> 00:37:25.610
PARTIS PORTABLE DEMOCRACY MORE

00:37:25.676 --> 00:37:29.180
RESPECTED. I REALLY THINK WE ARE

00:37:29.246 --> 00:37:33.050
IN AN ERA. WHEN EVERY LAWMAKER

00:37:33.117 --> 00:37:35.519
EVERY PUBLIC OFFICIAL REALLY HAS

00:37:35.586 --> 00:37:36.887
TO CONCENTRATE ON HOW DO WE MAKE

00:37:36.954 --> 00:37:38.189
OUR SYSTEMS ARE INTERESTED

00:37:38.255 --> 00:37:39.724
GOVERNMENT MORE RESPECTED. BY

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:45.930
OUR PEOPLE. AND- SO AS I SAY

00:37:45.997 --> 00:37:47.231
THIS BILL REQUIRES THE STATE IS

00:37:47.298 --> 00:37:49.100
TO REVIEW ALL OF ITS REGULATIONS

00:37:49.166 --> 00:37:50.067
AND DIGNIFIED REVISED IN THE

00:37:50.134 --> 00:37:52.536
THAT ARE DUPLICATIVE OVERLAPPING

00:37:52.603 --> 00:37:53.871
INCONSISTENT RUN DATE. THERE'S A

00:37:53.938 --> 00:37:56.907
TIMELINE FOR THIS THANK JANUARY

00:37:56.974 --> 00:37:59.377
ONE TWENTY TWENTY SIX. I DO I

00:37:59.443 --> 00:38:00.811
WELL KNOW THAT THE OFFICE

00:38:00.878 --> 00:38:02.179
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REQUIRES A

00:38:02.246 --> 00:38:04.515
REVIEW AT THE OUTSET. I WENT TO

00:38:04.582 --> 00:38:06.517
WORK IN THE BILL IN NINETEEN

00:38:06.584 --> 00:38:07.118
SEVENTY SEVEN RIGHT AFTER OIL

00:38:07.184 --> 00:38:08.719
HAVE BEEN SET UP IT WAS THAT IT

00:38:08.786 --> 00:38:11.589
WAS A- KEY KEYSTONE OF SPEAKER

00:38:11.656 --> 00:38:13.991
LOW MCCARTHY'S CAREER. THAT'S

00:38:14.058 --> 00:38:16.494
WHY WOULD I GO BACK TO THAT DAY.

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:19.697
AW THIS ISONE THAT IS MORE AS I

00:38:19.764 --> 00:38:21.599
SAY IT'S FOCUSED ON THE PASSAGE

00:38:21.666 --> 00:38:24.101
OF TIME. AND AS I SAY I TO OUR

00:38:24.168 --> 00:38:27.071
INSTITUTION. DEALS WITH THAT SO

00:38:27.138 --> 00:38:28.572
MANY OF OUR BILLS ARE KIND OF

00:38:28.639 --> 00:38:30.708
LOOKING STATUTES- SO I DO THINK

00:38:30.775 --> 00:38:32.710
IT'S SUPPORTS ACCOUNTABILITY BUT

00:38:32.777 --> 00:38:35.012
REALLY I THINK IT'S- A DAUNTING

00:38:35.079 --> 00:38:37.048
TIME PASSES THINGS CHANGE.

00:38:37.114 --> 00:38:38.683
PEOPLE WANT TO FEEL OUR SYSTEM

00:38:38.749 --> 00:38:39.784
GOVERNOR'S RESPONSIVE I THINK

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:43.454
THIS IS. IT IS NOT A HEAVY LEFT

00:38:43.521 --> 00:38:45.189
. THERE COULD BE A QUESTION AND

00:38:45.256 --> 00:38:47.058
IT HAS BEEN RAISED BY SOME OF

00:38:47.124 --> 00:38:48.059
THE CRITICS OF. ALL MY ALL MY

00:38:48.125 --> 00:38:49.760
GOSH THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

00:38:49.827 --> 00:38:51.529
TAKE TIME AND RESOURCES TO DO

00:38:51.595 --> 00:38:54.899
THIS REVIEW. AND SO IT SORT OF

00:38:54.965 --> 00:38:56.500
BECOMES A QUESTION IS THAT THE

00:38:56.567 --> 00:38:57.601
RIGHT. USE OF TIME NOW THERE'S

00:38:57.668 --> 00:38:59.370
ACTUALLY A FAIR QUESTION.

00:38:59.437 --> 00:39:00.171
RESOURCE ALLOCATION ISSUES ARE

00:39:00.237 --> 00:39:01.939
ALWAYS IMPORTANT. BUT DOING IT

00:39:02.006 --> 00:39:03.874
THROUGH THE LENS OF DEMOCRACY

00:39:03.941 --> 00:39:05.409
AND HOW WE STRENGTHEN AND HOW WE

00:39:05.476 --> 00:39:08.479
ESTABLISHED THAT WE ARE. FULL ON

00:39:08.546 --> 00:39:11.382
. OKAY RESPONSIVE ACCOUNTABLE

00:39:11.449 --> 00:39:13.984
PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY I THINK

00:39:14.051 --> 00:39:15.319
THIS ONE TIME ALLOCATION OF

00:39:15.386 --> 00:39:17.521
RESOURCES THAT THEY HAVE FOR

00:39:17.588 --> 00:39:20.558
YEARS TO GET THROUGH IT IS NOT

00:39:20.624 --> 00:39:22.560
TOO GREAT A BURDEN ACTUALLY THEY

00:39:22.626 --> 00:39:25.496
GIVE ACTUALLY REBALANCES THE

00:39:25.563 --> 00:39:26.997
SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT'S GOOD FOR

00:39:27.064 --> 00:39:31.368
DEMOCRACY. ON SO THAT IS- MY

00:39:31.435 --> 00:39:34.205
PRESENTATION- I DO WANT TO NOTE

00:39:34.271 --> 00:39:36.207
THAT THERE IS THAT PROVISION.

00:39:36.273 --> 00:39:37.007

WE BELIEVE THAT. THIS BILL AS

00:44:39.143 --> 00:44:40.744
WRITTEN IN AFFECT WOULD BE

00:44:40.811 --> 00:44:42.713
SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT. WE

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:44.081
BELIEVE THAT BY FAR THE BIGGEST

00:44:44.148 --> 00:44:44.982
WEAKNESS IN OUR CURRENT

00:44:45.049 --> 00:44:46.383
REGULATORY STRUCTURE IS THE

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:48.419
AMOUNT OF TIME THAT IT TAKES.

00:44:48.485 --> 00:44:49.920
FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW WHEN IT

00:44:49.987 --> 00:44:50.888
COMES TO WORKER SAFETY STANDARDS

00:44:50.954 --> 00:44:52.823
IT TAKES ON AVERAGE SIX TO TEN

00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:54.792
YEARS OR MORE. FOR A NEW

00:44:54.858 --> 00:44:56.727
STANDARD TO TAKE A FACT AND WHAT

00:44:56.794 --> 00:44:58.028
THIS BILL WOULD DO IS REQUIRE

00:44:58.095 --> 00:44:58.896
THOSE WERE DEVELOPING THOSE

00:44:58.962 --> 00:45:00.931
REGULATIONS TO ESSENTIALLY DROP

00:45:00.998 --> 00:45:02.232
WHAT THEY'RE DOING GO BACK

00:45:02.299 --> 00:45:03.067
THROUGH ALL OF THE EXISTING

00:45:03.133 --> 00:45:05.402
TITLE A RAGS. AND LOOK FOR

00:45:05.469 --> 00:45:06.537
OVERLAPPING OR DUPLICATIVE FOR

00:45:06.603 --> 00:45:09.073
AND CONSISTENT LANGUAGE AND WHAT

00:45:09.139 --> 00:45:11.842
THAT WOULD DO I MEAN WE ALREADY

00:45:11.909 --> 00:45:12.976
SEE. THAT CREATE A LOT OF DELAYS

00:45:13.043 --> 00:45:14.545
WHEN THEY HAVE TO DROP WHAT

00:45:14.611 --> 00:45:15.746
THEY'RE DOING AND MOVE ON TO

00:45:15.813 --> 00:45:17.081
SOMETHING ELSE BUT BY REQUIRING

00:45:17.147 --> 00:45:18.882
THEM TO GO THROUGH EVERY SINGLE

00:45:18.949 --> 00:45:19.817
REGULATION THAT'S IN PLACE. IT

00:45:19.883 --> 00:45:21.819
WOULD OUT WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH

00:45:21.885 --> 00:45:23.454
TIME BUT IT WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:24.588
WORKERS ALREADY WAIT FAR TOO

00:45:24.655 --> 00:45:26.123
LONG SUFFER INJURIES IN SOME

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:26.890
CASES FATALITIES WHILE WAITING

00:45:26.957 --> 00:45:28.225
FOR THE STANDARDS TO TAKE A

00:45:28.292 --> 00:45:29.760
FACT. THIS BILL WOULD JUST

00:45:29.827 --> 00:45:31.028
EXTEND THAT AMOUNT OF TIME WE'RE

00:45:31.095 --> 00:45:31.795
VERY WORRIED ABOUT THAT. IN

00:45:31.862 --> 00:45:33.564
ADDITION PART OF THE REASON THAT

00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:35.866
IT TAKES SO LONG IS THAT THESE

00:45:35.933 --> 00:45:36.733
AGENCIES SPEND A GREAT DEAL OF

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.035
TIME OBSESSING OVER THE LANGUAGE

00:45:38.102 --> 00:45:40.437
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOESN'T

00:45:40.504 --> 00:45:41.138
ALREADY DUPLICATE EXISTING

00:45:41.205 --> 00:45:42.172
STANDARDS OR EXISTING REGULATORY

00:45:42.239 --> 00:45:45.676
LANGUAGE. AND SO BY REQUIRING

00:45:45.742 --> 00:45:47.478

ARGUMENT AND THERE'S NOTHING IN

00:46:16.006 --> 00:46:17.941

THE OPTION FOR THE OTHER RIGHT

REGULATIONS DEAL WITH US WHILE

00:51:14.204 --> 00:51:15.939
THAT MIGHT TAKE MORE RESOURCES

00:51:16.006 --> 00:51:17.741
WE STILL NEED THE UMPIRES ON THE

00:51:17.808 --> 00:51:19.075

PROPOSALS FOR THE NEXT COMMITTEE

00:51:29.019 --> 00:51:30.220
HEARINGS WHERE WE COULD GET THE

00:51:30.287 --> 00:51:31.688
MONEY AND THEY COULD BECOME

00:51:31.755 --> 00:51:33.123
CHAMPIONS OF THIS EFFORT MAKING

00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:35.392
SURE THAT WE HAVE THE MONEY BOTH

00:51:35.459 --> 00:51:35.992
TO DO OUR CURRENT JOB. ABOUT

00:51:36.059 --> 00:51:38.595
ALSO HAVE THE RESOURCES TO LOOK

00:51:38.662 --> 00:51:40.964
AT A JUDGE DUPLICATIVE.

00:51:41.031 --> 00:51:42.599
REGULATIONS THAT MAKES LESS

00:51:42.666 --> 00:51:43.767

YOU THINK YEAH. WELL I THINK

00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:03.687
MOST MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT IF

00:52:03.753 --> 00:52:04.921
YOU BELIEVE IN SOMETHING YOU PUT

00:52:04.988 --> 00:52:06.289
MONEY BEHIND. STRUCTURE THAT

00:52:06.356 --> 00:52:08.124

TO BE SENDING. IT THAT SAYS IT

00:52:11.228 --> 00:52:16.766
IS A PRIORITY ON. I THINK THE-

00:52:16.833 --> 00:52:18.435
IN THEIR PROCESS I THINK THE

00:52:18.502 --> 00:52:19.669
OPPORTUNITY OF COURSES BILL JUST

00:52:19.736 --> 00:52:21.238
FOCUS ON DUPLICATIVE

00:52:21.304 --> 00:52:24.274
INCONSISTENT OUTDATED. AHA

00:52:24.341 --> 00:52:26.443
ACTUALLY THAT'LL END UP BEING AN

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:28.879
ERROR CLASS OF THINGS BUT I. THE

00:52:28.945 --> 00:52:31.047
IDEA OF KIND OF PROVIDING SOME

00:52:31.114 --> 00:52:33.083
FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE PROCESS I

00:52:33.149 --> 00:52:35.719

CEASE AND THAT WOULD GO TO THE

00:52:43.994 --> 00:52:45.328
STANDING COMMITTEE SO. I'VE

00:52:45.395 --> 00:52:47.030

LISTING TO THEM TO HAVE IT

00:52:56.506 --> 00:52:58.942
ILLEGIBLE MORE THAN THIRTY DAYS

00:52:59.009 --> 00:52:59.843
ALLOWS A LITTLE MORE

00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:01.077
CONVERSATION TO HAPPEN AND

00:53:01.144 --> 00:53:02.379
