THERE MANY OF THOSE AREAS

00:42:48.899 --> 00:42:51.735
AROUND THE STATE. MISS GONZALEZ

00:42:51.802 --> 00:42:55.072
IS BILL- WAS MORE A WAS MORE OF

THE CARROT AND STICK. IN IT.

00:43:03.547 --> 00:43:06.951
THE INCENTIVES IN IT. INCLUDING

PERIOD FOR REVIEW BY THE

00:43:11.722 --> 00:43:13.223
DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE SO THAT

00:43:13.290 --> 00:43:14.391
THE INSURANCE COMPANIES CAN GET

00:43:14.458 --> 00:43:16.260
AN ANSWER AND THEN OFFER

00:43:16.327 --> 00:43:21.999
INSURANCE IN THOSE AREAS. SO MY

00:43:22.066 --> 00:43:22.599
BILL HAS SOME FEATURES THAT I

00:43:22.666 --> 00:43:24.468
THINK- WILL STIMULATE THE

00:43:24.535 --> 00:43:24.969
MARKETING GIVE CONSUMERS

00:43:25.035 --> 00:43:28.572
CHOICES- HER BILL DID NOT HAVE

00:43:28.639 --> 00:43:30.808
THOSE FEATURES IN MY OPINION-

00:43:30.874 --> 00:43:33.110
THERE WERE SOME- IN BACKGROUND

00:43:33.177 --> 00:43:35.312
DETAILS WHICH I'D RATHER NOT GO

00:43:35.379 --> 00:43:39.383
INTO IN TERMS OF THE. IN A

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:40.784
PRESS CONFERENCE APPROACH TO

00:43:40.851 --> 00:43:44.254
CARRYING A BILL- WAS ONE

00:43:44.321 --> 00:43:46.690
FEATURE THAT TO I THOUGHT WAS

00:43:46.757 --> 00:43:48.625
UNFORTUNATE NOT MY BILL BUT THE

00:43:48.692 --> 00:43:50.427
OTHER ONE OKAY SO YOUR YOUR

00:43:50.494 --> 00:43:51.895
ANSWER LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT

00:43:51.962 --> 00:43:53.831

THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS

01:07:02.118 --> 01:07:04.854

WOULD THE INSURER. WHY WOULD BE

01:07:20.469 --> 01:07:23.139

COMMENTS MY COLLEAGUE FROM

01:08:00.743 --> 01:08:03.479
RIVERSIDE MENTION THAT THE BILL

01:08:03.546 --> 01:08:04.780
WE GOT OUT OF COMMITTEE WOULD

01:08:04.847 --> 01:08:07.550

01:08:11.687 --> 01:08:14.356
TODAY AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE A

01:08:14.423 --> 01:08:16.926
FEW COMMENTS- I APPRECIATE. THE

01:08:16.992 --> 01:08:18.627

GET AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. RIGHT

01:08:24.533 --> 01:08:28.103
TEN THROUGH THE PROCESS- I

01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:30.372
THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:31.373
TO CONTINUE TO HAVE MOVE

01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:34.109

01:08:38.013 --> 01:08:38.547
OPPOSITION FROM THE INSURANCE

01:08:38.614 --> 01:08:39.849
COMMISSIONER I THINK THAT'S

01:08:39.915 --> 01:08:41.550
SOMETHING WE SHOULD. WE SHOULD

01:08:41.617 --> 01:08:43.886

01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:45.855

SUCH AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. I

01:08:49.291 --> 01:08:53.863
THINK THE RATE INCREASE ISSUE

01:08:53.929 --> 01:08:55.297
IS IMPORTANT. PASSAGE WITH THAT

01:08:55.364 --> 01:08:56.832
LATER A MEMBER THERE MAY BE.

01:12:55.804 --> 01:12:57.406
COLLABORATIVE IT SHOULD PUT THE

01:12:57.473 --> 01:12:58.474
INSURANCE COMMISSIONER IN THE

01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:00.509
CENTER. AND DOT LAST YEAH I

01:13:00.576 --> 01:13:01.944
WOULD SAY I KNOW I MAY NOT SEE

01:13:02.010 --> 01:13:03.145
MICHAEL THEY'RE RELATED BUT I

01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:04.513
THINK WE HAVE THREE CRISIS IS

01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:06.415
ON OUR HANDS NUMBER ONE WE DO

01:13:06.482 --> 01:13:08.484
HAVE COVER NINETEEN. NUMBER TWO

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:10.152
WE DO HAVE THE UNEMPLOYMENT

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:11.620
WHICH IS ONE OF OUR BIGGEST

01:13:11.687 --> 01:13:12.588
ISSUES. BUT WE'RE FORGETTING

01:13:12.654 --> 01:13:14.423
THE THREE PRONG WHICH IS

01:13:14.490 --> 01:13:16.158
WORKING HEADING INTO FIRE

01:13:16.225 --> 01:13:17.659
SEASON. AND WE'VE BEEN DEALING

01:13:17.726 --> 01:13:18.460
WITH THIS SENSE YOU KNOW THE

01:13:18.527 --> 01:13:20.863
DEVASTATION SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN

01:13:20.929 --> 01:13:22.498
SO THIS DOES BECOME ORIGIN IN

01:13:22.564 --> 01:13:24.133
THE SENSE THAT. WE NEED TO MAKE

01:13:24.199 --> 01:13:25.768
SURE SOMETHING IS IN THE WORKS

01:13:25.834 --> 01:13:27.469
TO HELP THOSE FOLKS THAT ARE

01:13:27.536 --> 01:13:28.737
UNABLE TO GET INSURANCE IN THE

01:13:28.804 --> 01:13:31.039
WE AREA. FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN

01:13:31.106 --> 01:13:32.708
INSURE THEM THIS IS REALLY

01:13:32.775 --> 01:13:33.709
FOCUSED ON TRYING TO MAKE SURE

01:13:33.776 --> 01:13:35.310
THAT. THE CONSUMERS HAVE

01:13:35.377 --> 01:13:37.579
OPTIONS THEY'RE NOT DROPPED

01:13:37.646 --> 01:13:38.747
THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO TO THE

01:13:38.814 --> 01:13:40.215
FAIR PLAN WHICH MAKES IT SO

01:13:40.282 --> 01:13:42.618
MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE. AND

01:13:42.684 --> 01:13:45.854
THEREFORE I THINK THAT IT'S

01:13:45.921 --> 01:13:47.656
EMPTY NOW WE DE. CONTINUE TO

01:13:47.723 --> 01:13:49.825

SIMILARLY TO THE COMMENTS MADE

BY MY COLLEAGUE IN SAN DIEGO

01:22:08.156 --> 01:22:09.391
HOWEVER I'M GOING TO STAY OFF

01:22:09.457 --> 01:22:12.227
THE BILL TODAY. THIS IS A VERY

01:22:12.294 --> 01:22:15.030
VERY NEEDY PUBLIC POLICY ISSUE.

01:22:15.096 --> 01:22:16.665
I THINK FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THE

01:22:16.731 --> 01:22:18.466
PRNCIPAL TENET OF WHAT. I

01:22:18.533 --> 01:22:19.701
UNDERSTOOD THE GOAL TO BE WHICH

01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:20.402
WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:22:20.468 --> 01:22:22.103
HOMEOWNERS WHO. WERE NO LONGER

01:22:22.170 --> 01:22:23.471
BEING PROVIDED COVERAGE I DON'T

01:22:23.538 --> 01:22:24.572
KNOW THAT IT'S DIRECTLY

01:22:24.639 --> 01:22:26.574
ADDRESSED BY. WHAT'S BEING

01:22:26.641 --> 01:22:28.310
PROPOSED HERE TODAY. BUT BUT

01:22:28.376 --> 01:22:28.943
FUNDAMENTALLY FROM MY

01:22:29.010 --> 01:22:30.578
PERSPECTIVE THIS KIND OF BILL

01:22:30.645 --> 01:22:32.080
IS PRECISELY WHY WE HAVE TWO

01:22:32.147 --> 01:22:35.250
CALENDAR YEARS IN THE SESSION.

01:22:35.317 --> 01:22:35.817

DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE THE

01:22:36.451 --> 01:22:39.821
TIME. TO GET THROUGH. ALL OF

01:22:39.888 --> 01:22:42.390
THE ISSUES ARE AND I STAND

01:22:42.457 --> 01:22:44.392
REMAIN CONCERNED. BY A NUMBER

01:22:44.459 --> 01:22:46.895

COMMISSIONERS. YOU KNOW VOTER

01:22:53.134 --> 01:22:56.204

AM NOT COMFORTABLE TODAY ON THE

01:22:58.173 --> 01:22:59.574
