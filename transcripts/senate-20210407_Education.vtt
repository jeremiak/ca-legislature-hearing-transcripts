WANT TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE

00:13:09.889 --> 00:13:11.390
WITH THEM HOW. HOW IT WOULD

00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:13.993
AFFECT THEM. SO WE BASICALLY

00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:16.996
DID. TWO THINGS- THIS STARTING

00:13:17.062 --> 00:13:18.764
WITH THE COUNTIES OF SEVENTY

00:13:18.831 --> 00:13:19.965
THOUSAND OR LESS. AND THEN

00:13:20.032 --> 00:13:21.600
USING THE FEDERAL DEFINITION OF

00:13:21.667 --> 00:13:23.736
RURAL SCHOOL SO THOSE SCHOOL

00:13:23.802 --> 00:13:24.470

00:13:24.537 --> 00:13:26.272
DEFINITION. FOR THOSE FEDERAL

00:13:26.338 --> 00:13:27.406
PROGRAMS AND THEY WOULD BE

00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:29.341

00:13:38.417 --> 00:13:40.519
THAT ROLE THAT FEDERAL EXACT.

00:13:40.586 --> 00:13:43.589
DEFINITION SO- THAT'S WHY WE

00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:44.823
TRY TO CAPTURE THAT DID IT I

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.159
DIDN'T FIND THAT IN MY POCKET

00:13:47.226 --> 00:13:47.993

DIFFERENT TYPES OF DEFINITIONS

00:13:59.205 --> 00:14:00.773
WITHIN THE BILL THAT WOULD

00:14:00.839 --> 00:14:03.209
ALLOW FOR QUALIFICATION. FOR

00:14:03.275 --> 00:14:05.611
POTENTIAL EXEMPTION. IN WOULD

00:14:05.678 --> 00:14:06.645

00:14:17.723 --> 00:14:18.591
JUST BEING CANDID THERE ARE

00:14:18.657 --> 00:14:20.025
SOME COUNTIES. THAT WOULD BE

00:14:20.092 --> 00:14:22.394
CONSIDERED RULE THERE UNDER A

00:14:22.461 --> 00:14:22.928
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FOR

00:14:22.995 --> 00:14:24.129
EXAMPLE IN OUR NECK OF THE

WOODS. AND NOT ALL SCHOOLS

00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:28.067
WOULD QUALIFY FOR THE EXEMPTION

00:14:28.133 --> 00:14:29.635
BUT SOME SCHOOLS LIKE IN A

00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:31.237
COUNTY A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND

00:14:31.303 --> 00:14:35.474
WOULD BASE OFF OF THE TWO OTHER

00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:35.975
DEFINITIONS. OF A RURAL

00:14:36.041 --> 00:14:37.076

HAPPENS TO BE IN A RURAL.

00:14:48.754 --> 00:14:50.756
COUNTY THEN IT WOULDN'T BE FAIR

00:14:50.823 --> 00:14:52.825
SO WE TRIED TO USE THE FEDERAL

00:14:52.891 --> 00:14:54.393

00:20:02.568 --> 00:20:04.436
WHEN YOU FACTOR THE COST OF

00:20:07.139 --> 00:20:09.908
INADEQUATE- LOW INCOME LEVEL

00:20:09.975 --> 00:20:13.645

00:39:50.955 --> 00:39:52.323
GONNA GET THROWN IN AND IT GETS

00:39:52.389 --> 00:39:53.290
THROWN IN THE DUMPSTER AT THE

00:39:53.357 --> 00:39:54.458
END OF THE DAY IT'S PART OF

00:39:54.525 --> 00:39:56.060
THAT 40% OF THE FOOD TO GET

00:39:56.127 --> 00:39:57.895

CHILDREN TAKE IT WITH THEM

00:40:10.341 --> 00:40:11.475
BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM THAT WAS

00:40:11.542 --> 00:40:12.643
THEIR DINNER AND THEY WERE THEY

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:13.978
WERE SNEAKING THAT WHEN THEY

00:40:14.044 --> 00:40:14.879
WHEN THEY WERE GRABBING

00:40:14.945 --> 00:40:16.113
OPPORTUNITIES OR EVEN TAKEN

BRINGING THIS BILL TO US TODAY-

00:40:43.641 --> 00:40:44.708
IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT I

00:40:44.775 --> 00:40:46.644
AM HAPPY TO SUPPORT I KNOW

00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:48.345
WE'RE NOT THE FISCAL COMMITTEE

00:40:48.412 --> 00:40:49.980
BUT- COULD YOU JUST AT LEAST-

00:40:50.047 --> 00:40:51.315
GIVE US SOME SENSE OF THAT

00:40:51.382 --> 00:40:54.051
COSTS THAT SUIT AT THIS BILL IS

00:40:54.118 --> 00:40:56.153
EXPECTED TO BE. I APPRECIATE

00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:59.190
THE QUESTION WE- WE DON'T HAVE

00:40:59.256 --> 00:41:01.192
THE FULL COST. ESTIMATE YET.

00:41:01.258 --> 00:41:02.560
BECAUSE PART OF IT'S GOING TO

00:41:02.626 --> 00:41:05.129
DEPEND ON. WHETHER CERTAIN OF

00:41:05.196 --> 00:41:07.331
THE- PROGRAMS THAT THE FEDERAL

00:41:07.398 --> 00:41:09.400
GOVERNMENT HAD ENACTED. AT THE

00:41:09.466 --> 00:41:10.868
MOMENT THEY'RE SCHEDULED TO

00:41:10.935 --> 00:41:12.636
SUNSET. IF THEY CONTINUE

00:41:12.703 --> 00:41:17.741
HOWEVER. THEN THE- WHAT. NUMBER

00:41:17.808 --> 00:41:19.510
ONE CALIFORNIA ALREADY IS NOT.

00:41:19.577 --> 00:41:21.712
MAXIMIZING ITS RECEIPT. OF

00:41:21.779 --> 00:41:23.581
FEDERAL FUNDS FOR SCHOOL MEALS.

00:41:23.647 --> 00:41:26.050
SO ON WE'RE STILL CALCULATING

00:41:26.116 --> 00:41:27.618
EVEN IF THERE'S NO CHANGE BY

00:41:27.685 --> 00:41:28.485
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO

00:41:28.552 --> 00:41:31.388
SWEAT. THE THIS BILL WOULD COST

00:41:31.455 --> 00:41:33.390
US IF WE WERE ABLE TO MAXIMIZE

00:41:33.457 --> 00:41:34.859
THAT WE'RE STILL DOING THAT.

00:41:34.925 --> 00:41:38.295
THOSE CALCULATIONS. HOWEVER IF

00:41:38.362 --> 00:41:40.164
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WERE TO.

00:41:40.231 --> 00:41:42.066
ON EITHER ENACT PERMANENTLY OR

00:41:42.132 --> 00:41:43.868
EXTEND SOME OF THE PROGRAMS

00:41:43.934 --> 00:41:45.469
THAT WERE SET UP. DURING THE

00:41:45.536 --> 00:41:47.938
PANDEMIC. THEN THAT WOULD

00:41:48.005 --> 00:41:49.640
REDUCE CALIFORNIA'S COST EVEN

00:41:49.707 --> 00:41:52.276
FURTHER SO WILL WE WILL BE

00:41:52.343 --> 00:41:54.478

I'M POLICIES I DO NOT HAVE THAT

00:42:05.089 --> 00:42:06.590
NUMBER AT THE TOP AT MY

THEY PROVIDED DURING THIS

00:43:25.369 --> 00:43:27.371
PANDEMIC TIME TO A PROVISION OF

00:43:27.438 --> 00:43:29.239
THE BILL THAT I DID NOT MENTION

00:43:29.306 --> 00:43:30.975
IS THE ABILITY FOR CALIFORNIA

00:43:31.041 --> 00:43:32.776
TO CONTINUE A MEAL PROGRAM

00:43:32.843 --> 00:43:35.446
WENDOUREE ARE SCHOOL CLOSURES.

IN AT LET'S SAY- ANY KIND OF

00:43:39.183 --> 00:43:40.417
DISASTER WHERE THERE WOULD

00:43:40.484 --> 00:43:42.853
MIGHT MIGHT BE SIGNED AND WE

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:43.954
KNOW THAT THE SCHOOL MEAL

00:43:44.021 --> 00:43:45.756
PROGRAMS ARE STILL SO ESSENTIAL

00:43:45.823 --> 00:43:47.858
FOR THE STUDENTS. SO THAT'S ONE

00:43:47.925 --> 00:43:48.859
ASPECT OF THE BILL THE OTHER

00:43:48.926 --> 00:43:51.762
ASPECT THAT WAS MENTIONED BY

EMPHASIZE WHICH I SHOULD HAVE

00:43:54.898 --> 00:43:56.934
IS THAT ANOTHER COMPONENT THIS

00:43:57.001 --> 00:44:00.904
BILL. IS- THE CONCEPT OF

00:44:00.971 --> 00:44:02.339
PROVIDING MEALS FOR OUR

MANUFACTURERS. TO CUT THEIR

00:44:33.871 --> 00:44:36.874
COSTS AND IF WE THINK ABOUT OUR

00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:38.475
OWN AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS

00:44:38.542 --> 00:44:40.344
CALIFORNIA GETS THE LEAST

00:44:40.411 --> 00:44:42.479
FEDERAL SUBSIDIES FOR THE CROPS

THERE'S A COMPONENT OF THE BILL

00:45:05.302 --> 00:45:07.337
THAT WOULD. ALLOW FOR SCHOOL

00:47:10.427 --> 00:47:11.962
DEALS WITH THE ISSUE OF SCHOOL

00:47:12.029 --> 00:47:14.097
CLIMATE. RESEARCH INDICATES

00:47:14.164 --> 00:47:15.299
THAT SCHOOL CLIMATE STRONGLY

00:47:15.365 --> 00:47:17.000
INFLUENCES STUDENTS MOTIVATION

00:47:17.067 --> 00:47:18.468
TO LEARN AND IMPROVE ACADEMIC

00:47:18.535 --> 00:47:20.704
ACHIEVEMENT- WE ALL KNOW THAT

00:47:20.771 --> 00:47:22.239
PEOPLE DO BETTER WHEN THEY ARE

00:47:22.306 --> 00:47:24.208
IN A IN A POSITIVE ENVIRONMENT-

00:47:24.274 --> 00:47:26.210
ALREADY SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE

00:47:26.276 --> 00:47:28.512
REQUIRED EVERY OTHER YEAR TO DO

00:47:28.579 --> 00:47:31.415
A- CLIMATE SURVEY- SO THIS IS

00:47:31.481 --> 00:47:32.382
JUST TAKING IT A STEP FURTHER

00:47:32.449 --> 00:47:33.984
AND JUST SAYING THE RESULTS OF

00:47:34.051 --> 00:47:35.085
THAT CLIMATE SURVEY SHOULD

00:47:35.152 --> 00:47:36.687
SERVE AS A STATE WIDE INDICATOR

00:47:36.753 --> 00:47:38.622
AND BE ON THE DASHBOARD SO

00:47:38.689 --> 00:47:40.390
PARENTS OR COMMUNITY MEMBERS OR

00:47:40.457 --> 00:47:41.158
STUDENTS THEMSELVES CAN LOOK

00:47:41.225 --> 00:47:42.926
AROUND. AND SEE WHAT THE

00:47:42.993 --> 00:47:46.330
CLIMATE IS SO THE- THE IDEA IS

00:47:46.396 --> 00:47:47.364
THAT THERE'S ALREADY SOME

00:47:47.431 --> 00:47:49.299
EXISTING TOOLS BUT THAT FROM

00:47:49.366 --> 00:47:50.767
THOSE EXISTING TOOLS SOME

00:47:50.834 --> 00:47:52.302
COMMON INDICATORS WILL BE

00:47:52.369 --> 00:47:53.870
DEVELOPED SO THAT WE CAN THEN

00:47:53.937 --> 00:47:55.505
MEASURE AND PUT THAT STATEWIDE

00:47:55.572 --> 00:47:57.407
ACROSS ON ON DASHBOARDS AND SO

00:47:57.474 --> 00:47:58.942
AGAIN PEOPLE CN REFER TO THAT

00:47:59.009 --> 00:48:00.844
AND THEN WE CAN ALSO DEVELOP-

00:48:00.911 --> 00:48:02.646
SPECIFIC INTERVENTIONS BASED ON

00:48:02.713 --> 00:48:04.648
THE DATA TO BE ABLE TO SUGGEST

00:48:04.715 --> 00:48:07.417
WAYS TO IMPROVE. THE CLIMATE WE

00:48:07.484 --> 00:48:09.019
KNOW IN OUR TIMES OF A EXTREME

00:48:09.086 --> 00:48:12.689
POLARIZATION- A LOT OF- TENSION

00:48:12.756 --> 00:48:13.757
IN THE AIR THAT THAT OFTEN

00:48:13.824 --> 00:48:15.659
FILTERS DOWN TO OUR YOUNG

00:48:15.726 --> 00:48:16.660
PEOPLE AND THE LEARNING

00:48:16.727 --> 00:48:17.894
ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEIR

00:48:17.961 --> 00:48:19.663
EXISTING IN SO WE WANT TO MAKE

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:21.465
SURE THAT WE ARE TRACKING THAT

00:48:21.531 --> 00:48:22.699
AND THAT THEN WE CAN DO A

00:48:22.766 --> 00:48:24.268
APPROPRIATE INTERVENTIONS AS

00:48:24.334 --> 00:48:27.771

FOR OUR SCHOOLS TO PRIORITIZE

00:49:24.027 --> 00:49:25.562
THE NEEDS OF THE WHOLE CHILD.

00:49:25.629 --> 00:49:27.064
AND WHILE MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:28.198
IN CALIFORNIA HAVE EMBRACED

00:49:28.265 --> 00:49:31.735
THAT IMPERATIVE. THAT IS NOT

00:49:31.802 --> 00:49:32.636
THE CASE EVERYWHERE. A GROWING

NEVERTHELESS EVEN WITH THIS

00:49:46.416 --> 00:49:47.718
ROBUST EVIDENCE SOME TEACHERS

00:49:47.784 --> 00:49:49.119

THAT THE ISSUE OF SCHOOL

00:49:55.025 --> 00:49:55.926
CLIMATE IN GENERAL BEING IS NOT

00:49:55.992 --> 00:49:57.561
A NEW ONE. BUT HOW CAN WE

00:49:57.627 --> 00:49:59.029
ENSURE THAT THERE IS MORE

00:49:59.096 --> 00:50:01.798
CONSISTENT FOCUS ON THESE

00:50:01.865 --> 00:50:02.699

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:53.116

GOODS MOVEMENT. IS A SENATOR

01:00:59.722 --> 01:01:02.658
BORDER CROSSING. AND SO THIS

01:01:02.725 --> 01:01:04.794
THIS COMPLETES THESE BORDER

01:01:04.861 --> 01:01:06.295
THESE- INFRASTRUCTURE

01:01:06.362 --> 01:01:09.265
INVESTMENTS COMPETE. WITH ALL

01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:11.100
THE PORTS IF YOU CONSIDER THE

01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:12.969
LONG BEACH PORT DE LA PORT

01:01:13.036 --> 01:01:15.671
THESE ARE MASSIVE OF PORTS THAT

MOVE GOODS THAT GOES PARKS

01:01:17.573 --> 01:01:20.543
CANADA. AND IN MANY OF THOSE

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:22.145
GOODS GO WE ACTUALLY INTO

01:01:22.211 --> 01:01:24.013
MEXICO AS WELL SO IF YOU

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:25.882
CONSIDER THE AMOUNT OF GOODS

01:01:25.948 --> 01:01:26.849
MOVEMENT HAPPENING THE BORDER

01:01:26.916 --> 01:01:28.785
THE AMOUNT OF BORDER CROSSINGS

01:01:28.851 --> 01:01:29.285
WITH THE BUSIEST BORDER

01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:31.621
CROSSING IN THE WORLD. IN MY

01:01:31.687 --> 01:01:33.523
DISTRICT AND SENATE ZERO. AND

01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:36.559
WE HAVE A JUST A COMPLEX.

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:38.928
COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE THAT COME

01:01:38.995 --> 01:01:40.029
BACK AND FORTH EVERY SINGLE

01:01:40.096 --> 01:01:41.564
DAY. AND THE EDUCATIONAL

01:01:41.631 --> 01:01:45.468
PROGRAM. IS CORRECT WILL

01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:47.570
GREATLY UNDERSERVED IN TERMS OF

01:01:47.637 --> 01:01:48.504
THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES THAT

01:01:48.571 --> 01:01:50.907
APPLIED TO ADMIT EDUCATING

01:01:50.973 --> 01:01:52.308
THESE YOUNG PEOPLE AND

01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:55.445
PREPARING THEM FOR. THE ECONOMY

01:01:55.511 --> 01:01:57.513
THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY A MAJOR

01:01:57.580 --> 01:02:00.783
PART OF. SO THIS THIS BILL IS

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:03.519
ASKING THAT WE START TO CREATE

01:02:03.586 --> 01:02:05.021
A STRATEGIC PLAN TO GET BETTER

01:02:05.088 --> 01:02:07.123
OUTCOMES AND PREPARE THESE

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:09.525
YOUNG PEOPLE TO ENTER FIELDS

01:02:09.592 --> 01:02:11.127
THAT ARE GOING TO PROVIDE. THEM

01:02:11.194 --> 01:02:13.496
NOT ONLY WITH A PERSONAL

01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:15.698
EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND A

01:02:15.765 --> 01:02:17.033
BRIGHTER FUTURE FOR THEMSELVES

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:19.836
BUT THAT THEY CONTRIBUTE. TO

01:02:19.902 --> 01:02:22.338
THE SKILL SET THAT THEY HAVE

01:02:22.405 --> 01:02:23.139
WITHIN THE ENVIRONMENT THEY

01:02:23.206 --> 01:02:26.542
WERE RAISED TO A KANEMI THAT IS

01:02:26.609 --> 01:02:28.444
PERFECT FOR THEM TO SUCCEED.

01:02:28.511 --> 01:02:32.582
AND SO. YOU KNOW IF YOU IF YOU

01:02:32.648 --> 01:02:34.050
CONSIDER THAT IN BASRA

01:02:34.117 --> 01:02:35.685
CALIFORNIA ALONG THE STATE

01:02:35.751 --> 01:02:37.153
ACROSS THE BORDER FROM MARS

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:39.188
THIS IS A STATE THE BORDERS MY

01:02:39.255 --> 01:02:39.722
DISTRICT IN THE STATE OF

01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:43.259
CALIFORNIA THEY'RE AN ESTIMATED

01:02:43.326 --> 01:02:44.727
FIFTY THOUSAND STUDENTS IN THAT

01:02:44.794 --> 01:02:46.896
IN THAT AREA. THE STUDENTS MAKE

01:02:46.963 --> 01:02:49.232
ABOUT A PART OF A GROWING

01:02:49.298 --> 01:02:50.867

01:02:50.933 --> 01:02:52.235
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER

01:02:52.301 --> 01:02:54.637
WHOSE EDUCATION IS DEEPLY

01:02:54.704 --> 01:02:57.240
SHAPED BY THE BY NATIONAL

FROM FROM ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

01:03:07.884 --> 01:03:09.218
OTHERS ATTENDING COLLEGES AND

01:03:09.285 --> 01:03:11.621
UNIVERSITIES MEANS THAT THEY

01:03:11.687 --> 01:03:14.624
MUST CROSS THE BORDER SOMETIMES

01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:17.193
MORE THAN ONCE A DAY. PAN AND

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:19.762
THIS IS IN LARGE PART HOW THEY

ARE PREPARING THEMSELVES FOR

01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:24.033
THE FUTURE RESEARCH FROM UCSD

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:25.768
HAS SHOWN THAT STUDENTS WILL BY

WITHOUT BY NATIONAL EXPERIENCE

01:03:33.976 --> 01:03:36.612
AND THERE. IN LIES IT SHOWS

01:03:36.679 --> 01:03:38.581
THAT THESE CHILDREN ARE LESS

01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:40.683
LIKELY TO RECEIVE ANY KIND OF

OF THE LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE

WORLD AND A MAJOR DRIVER OF THE

01:06:10.132 --> 01:06:12.368
CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. IT IS ALSO

01:06:12.435 --> 01:06:13.602
THE HOME OF HUNDREDS OF

01:06:13.669 --> 01:06:15.271
THOUSANDS OF TRANS NATIONAL U.

01:06:15.338 --> 01:06:17.273
S. AND MEXICAN STUDENTS WHO

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:19.141
THIS REGION IS RELYING ON TO

01:06:19.208 --> 01:06:20.743
FILL THE JOBS AND FUEL THE

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:22.478
INTEGRATION. THAT THE REGION

01:06:22.545 --> 01:06:24.447
NEEDS TO REMAIN THIS POWER

01:06:24.513 --> 01:06:26.716
HOUSES. BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT'S

01:06:26.782 --> 01:06:28.751
FALLING BEHIND THE MEXICAN

01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:30.653
ORIGIN STUDENTS ON THE US SIDE

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:33.022
ARE THE LEAST LIKELY OF ANY

01:06:33.089 --> 01:06:33.589
GROUP TO COMPLETE A COLLEGE

01:06:33.656 --> 01:06:36.926
DEGREE. AUSTIN 16% OF THESE

01:06:36.992 --> 01:06:38.861
MEXICAN ORIGIN STUDENTS

01:06:38.928 --> 01:06:40.062
COMPLETE A COLLEGE DEGREE

01:06:40.129 --> 01:06:42.198
COMPARED 2406% FOR WHITE

01:06:42.264 --> 01:06:45.368
STUDENTS AND 62% FOR ASIANS.

01:06:45.434 --> 01:06:48.037
AND THIS IS THE MAJORITY OF THE

01:06:48.104 --> 01:06:50.106
STUDENT POPULATION IN THE AREA.

01:06:50.172 --> 01:06:51.640
THE CROSS THE BORDER IN TIJUANA

01:06:51.707 --> 01:06:53.642
WE HAVE FIFTY THREE THOUSAND US

01:06:53.709 --> 01:06:55.111
CITIZENS STUDENTS TRYING TO

01:06:55.177 --> 01:06:56.379
MAKE THEIR WAY THROUGH THE

01:06:56.445 --> 01:06:58.714
MEXICANS COOLING SYSTEM. BEFORE

01:06:58.781 --> 01:07:00.950
THEY RETURNED TO THE U. S. BUT

01:07:01.016 --> 01:07:02.051
MOST DON'T READ AND WRITE

01:07:02.118 --> 01:07:03.953
SPANISH AND SO THEY FLOUNDER IN

01:07:04.019 --> 01:07:06.222
SCHOOL. AND MANY ARE LEFT OUT

01:07:06.288 --> 01:07:07.390
OF THE SYSTEM ALTOGETHER

01:07:07.456 --> 01:07:09.558
BECAUSE OF A LACK OF SPACE AND

01:07:09.625 --> 01:07:11.127
OFTEN THE NEED TO WORK. THE

01:07:11.193 --> 01:07:12.628
AVERAGE COMPLETION RATE

01:07:12.695 --> 01:07:13.996
DISCOUNT OF SCHOOLING IN BAJA

01:07:14.063 --> 01:07:16.999
CALIFORNIA IS JUST NINTH GRADE.

01:07:17.066 --> 01:07:18.601
THIS IS THE FUTURE WORK FORCE

01:07:18.667 --> 01:07:20.469
FOR THE REGION AND THEY'RE NOT

01:07:20.536 --> 01:07:22.738
BEING ADEQUATELY PREPARED. THE

01:07:22.805 --> 01:07:24.673
REAL SHAME ABOUT THIS TOO IS

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:26.108
THAT THESE ARE POTENTIALLY OUR

01:07:26.175 --> 01:07:28.677
BEST STUDENTS. OUR RESEARCH AT

01:07:28.744 --> 01:07:30.012
THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

01:07:30.079 --> 01:07:31.947
SHOWS THAT THEY'RE TENACIOUS

01:07:32.014 --> 01:07:33.949
PERSISTENT AND OPTIMISTIC. THEY

01:07:34.016 --> 01:07:36.419
WANT GOOD JOBS THEY ALSO WANT A

01:07:36.485 --> 01:07:39.455
COLLEGE EDUCATION- THEY'RE

01:07:39.522 --> 01:07:41.557
BILINGUAL AND MULTICULTURAL.

01:07:41.624 --> 01:07:42.892
THERE THE NATURAL BRIDGE

01:07:42.958 --> 01:07:45.060
BUILDERS AND SOCIAL BROKERS

01:07:45.127 --> 01:07:47.296
THAT OUR TWO NATIONS NEED. TO

01:07:47.363 --> 01:07:48.831
RAISE THE EDUCATIONAL LEVEL AND

01:07:48.898 --> 01:07:50.132
BETTER PREPARE STUDENTS FOR THE

01:07:50.199 --> 01:07:53.135
WORKFORCE WE NEED. WE NEED MANY

01:07:53.202 --> 01:07:54.370
MORE TRAINED BILINGUAL

01:07:54.437 --> 01:07:56.038
EDUCATORS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE

01:07:56.105 --> 01:07:57.506
BORDER AS WELL AS WORKFORCE

01:07:57.573 --> 01:07:59.208
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS TO ENGAGE

01:07:59.275 --> 01:08:01.343

01:08:07.149 --> 01:08:08.484
THE MECHANISMS TO DO THAT. WHAT

01:08:08.551 --> 01:08:10.352
ARE BY NATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS WE

01:08:10.419 --> 01:08:11.954
HAVE CREATED SOME BILINGUAL

01:08:12.021 --> 01:08:13.856
TRANS NATIONAL CURRICULA

01:08:13.923 --> 01:08:16.058
PREPARED SOME TRANS NATIONAL

01:08:16.125 --> 01:08:17.626
TEACHER EDUCATORS. AND ARE

01:08:17.693 --> 01:08:19.395
CREATING PATHWAYS TO HELP MORE

01:08:19.462 --> 01:08:21.363
