THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. INVESTOR BURKE AND MEMBERS AT FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND THE CHAIRMAN FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS BILL AND LET ME START BY SAYING THAT ALL EXCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AS DRAFTED AND SO WE CAN MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD IT IS UNFORTUNATE HOWEVER THAT WE HAVE TO OMIT THE COUNTY JAILS FROM SB THIRTY NINE AS IT WAS INCLUDED IN THE STATE AUTHORS ARE TRIGGERS REPORT RECOMMENDATIONS. MY HOPE IS MOVING FORWARD THAT THE LEGISLATURE TO EVERYTHING THAT THEY CAN TO ELIMINATE AS MUCH PRIDE AS POSSIBLE IN THE EDT SYSTEM. SB THIRTY NINE WILL STRENGTHEN PROTECTIONS AGAINST FRAUDULENT CLAIMS FILED WITH THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. OR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AND PREVENT THESE BENEFITS FROM GOING TO INELIGIBLE RECIPIENTS THAT ARE INCARCERATED. FOLLOWING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE TO COPE IN NINETEEN IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY. CALIFORNIA TASK THE E. D. D. WITH DISTRIBUTING THE CHARISMATIC FRIENDS. THROUGH THE NEWLY CREATED PANDEMIC EMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. EVER DESPITE HAVING BEEN WARNED BY THE US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR ABOUT THE POTENTIAL RISK OF FRAUD DDT WAS NOT PREPARED TO PREVENT AND ADDRESS THE FRAUDULENT CLAIMS FILED WITH THE DEPARTMENT. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE- A STATE AUDIT REVEALED THAT THE EDT WAS TOLD ABOUT THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN AND DIDN'T DO MUCH TO PREVENT IT. THEIR FEET THEIR FAILURES- TO TAKE ACTION ALLOWED RAMPANT FRAUD TO TAKE PLACE IN TWENTY TWENTY AND IT STILL CONTINUES TODAY. IN THE FRAUD WAS SO PROLIFIC WITHIN THE EDT THAT THEY'VE PAID OUT ALMOST THEY PAID OUT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO FRAUDULENT CLAIMS. SOME ESTIMATES PUT THE TOTAL AMOUNT AND CLOSE TO THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS. IN THE AND IT'S RISING THANK YOU. AND IT'S RISING THESE BENEFITS WERE GIVEN TO PRISONERS WHO WERE ON DEATH ROW INCLUDING WELL KNOWN CONVICTED MURDERS LIKE SCOTT PETERSON. WHO KILLED HIS WIFE AND UNBORN CHILD OTHER EXAMPLES OF CONVICTED CONVICTED KILLERS WHO RECEIVED MULTIPLE BENEFITS INCLUDE ROYAL CLARK HE WAS CONVICTED OF KILLING TWO YOUNG GIRLS AND ASSAULTING ANOTHER. AND SUSAN EUBANKS WHO SHOT HER FOUR SONS AGES FOUR THROUGH FOURTEEN. IN THE HEAD AFTER A NIGHT OF DRINKING AND DRUGS. ADDITIONALLY A PRISON INMATE FRAUDULENT FILED UNDER THE NAME AS SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN. AN INMATE USES SO SECURITY NUMBER OF ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE TO GET BENEFITS. THIS IS UTTERLY RIDICULOUS. SO WHILE THIS FRAUD WAS GOING ON SINGLE MOMS AND FATHERS IN INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD WORKED HARD AND WERE ENTITLED TO BENEFITS. WERE FORCED TO DRAIN THEIR SAVINGS TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES AND PUT FOOD ON THE TABLES AND WAIT MONTHS FOR A RESPONSE FROM THE EDT. CALIFORNIA WAS ONLY AS ONLY ONE OF FIFTEEN STATES THAT FAILED TO CROSS MATCH UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS OF PRISON ROLES. WE CAN WE CAN ALL DO BETTER AND WE MUST DO BETTER FOR OUR STATE. MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN- LEFT HIGH AND DRY IS THE EDT IS FAILED TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE SERVICE. AND WE'VE ALL HEARD ABOUT IT FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS I KNOW THAT MY PHONE AND I'VE TALKED TO SEVERAL OF THE FOR OF MY COLLEAGUES. THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST- COMMON CALLS THAT COMES INTO OUR DISTRICT OFFICE. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT FUTURE FRAUD DOES NOT TAKE PLACE. MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE LOST THEIR JOB AT NO FARK FAULT OF THEIR OWN BECAUSE OF THE RESPONSE TO CODE NINETEEN. IN CALIFORNIA MESTI BETTER THERE'S NO THERE'S NO ROOM FOR NOTHING LESS. SB THIRTY NINE ENJOYS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND IS SUPPORTED BY NUMEROUS ORGANIZATIONS.

CALLERS IN Q. AND OPPOSITION I BRING IT BACK TO THE CAN A COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS BY THE COMMITTEE CENTER WINNER. VETERANS AFFAIRS A QUESTION THE AUTHOR AYE AYE CORRECT ME IF I'M IS HEARD YOU BEFORE. I THINK I HEARD YOU SAY THAT THERE WERE DEATH ROW INMATES THAT WERE APPLYING. FOR IT PERCENT THAT SAID I DID I HEAR THAT CORRECTLY YES BASED ON THE EDT REPORT IN THE DISTRIBUTORS REPORT THEIR DEATH ROW INMATES LIKE SCOTT PETERSON THAT WERE OF RUNNING FOR MINUTES AND NOT ONLY JUST APPLIED SIR BUT RECEIVED BENEFITS OUT. MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT. IT WASN'T NECESSARILY DOES OR WASN'T DOES THE CONDUCT PRO BUT WHAT I'VE SEEN AS IT WAS IN THOSE. INMATES ON DEATH ROW GOT APPROVED PEOPLE FRAUDULENTLY APPLYING AND THEIR NAMES ARE TO BE NO TO SCOTT PETERSON HAS TO GET THE MONEY. OR THE SOMEONE WHO PRESENT BECAUSE ALSO SOMEONE WHO. APPLIED IN CENTER FIND SCIENCE AND. REYES SO WASN'T. I'M NOT. SAYING THERE WAS FRAUD COMING FOR PUT IN THE- BUT THERE WAS A- PEOPLE WERE. IN PEOPLE'S. COULD DO LIKE COMMENT ON THAT. YES SO AND YOU ARE CORRECT THAT SOME PEOPLE WERE APPLYING IN OTHER PEOPLE'S NAMES OBVIOUSLY SENATOR FEINSTEIN DID NOT APPLY FOR BENEFITS. BUT A PRESENT OR FORMER ACTUALLY STATE EMPLOYEE DID APPLY. A WITH HER NAME IN AND THEN OTHER PEOPLE USING DIFFERENT SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS. THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION AND SPECIFICALLY MY DISTRICT ATTORNEY BECAUSE WE HAVE. A LARGE NUMBER OF PRISONS IN OUR COUNTY- HAVE- DEPLOYED FORENSIC INDIVIDUALS TO MONITOR PHONE CALLS- IN THE PRISON SYSTEM S. SO THAT THEY COULD IDENTIFY. A PEOPLE THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT THESE EDT BENEFITS AND THEY'VE AND COVERED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF FRAUD. AND THE TOTAL NUMBER FRAUD DOLLARS AFFRONT IS GONNA ESTIMATED AT THIRTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS. IN KERN COUNTY I BELIEVE IT'S AT TWO ELEVEN BILLION. RIGHT I TOTALLY AGREE WITH A LOT OF FRAUD GOING ON AND WE CAN GET A WHOLE SEPARATE CONVERSATION ABOUT YOU D. G. AND ITS FAILURES WHICH ARE YOUR AND MY STAFF PROPOSED BY DEALING WITH. EVERYDAY SINCE THE PANDEMIC. BEGAN ITS ANNOYING ON A LOT OF PEOPLE GET HARMED. BY NOT GETTING BENEFITS. BUT IN TERMS OF THE DEATH ROW INMATE'S. CARI CENTER PARK DEATH ROW INMATES ARE RECEIVED AS OPPOSED TO HAVING OTHER PEOPLE FLY IN THEIR NAMES. BECAUSE THIS WAS MY UNDERSTANDING IT'S POSSIBLE I'M WRONG. SO IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THERE ARE AND IT IS POSSIBLE I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT NUMBER OF INMATES THAT D. ON DEATH ROW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT DID RECEIVE THE BENEFITS ON THEIR BEHALF- BUT I DO HAVE SOME OF THE NAMES THAT WERE FILED AND I DID NOT. SEE I DID NOT GO AND DO THE RESEARCH TO FIND OUT IF THEY ACTUALLY DID RECEIVE THE BENEFITS AND THEIR FAMILIES RECEIVE THE BENEFITS. OR IF THEY SOMEONE JUST FILED IN THEIR NAME. I DID THAT I MADE AN ASSUMPTION WITH SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN THAT IT'S NOT LIKELY. THAT SENATOR FEINSTEIN WOULD FOUGHT FILED FOR THESE BENEFITS AND THAT WAS PROVEN LATER ON THAT. THAT AN EMPLOYEE DID SO I DID I APOLOGIZE TO IN HAVE AN ANSWER FOR YOU. WHAT I CAN'T IS THAT. THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR TO DOING TO. AND FOUND THAT THERE IS ABOUT THIRTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN FRAUD. IN THE PRISON SYSTEM THAT WAS FRAUDULENT ACCUMULATED OR RETAINED BY. INDIVIDUALS IN THE PRISON SYSTEM WITH EDT AND IT IS. THIRTY ONE BILLION CHAU I THOUGHT THIRTY ONE BILLION WAS THE GLOBAL NUMBER TOLERATE STILL I'VE NEVER. THE TOTAL NUMBER AND A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THAT CAME FROM THE PRISON SYSTEM. AND THAT'S WHY A SIMPLE SOLUTION THAT THE AUDITOR RECOMMENDED WOULD BE SB THIRTY NINE WHICH. THAT'S OKAY WHAT DO YOU DO WE KNOW WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE STATE OF THE AND I AM THIRTY ONE BILLION WAS ALSO. I KNOW THERE WAS A RANGE WE STILL DON'T KNOW THE EXACT NUMBER BUT- LET'S ASSUME IT WAS A THIRTY ONE BILLION- DO WE KNOW WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THAT WAS RELATED TO. PEOPLE APPLICATIONS EITHER BY OR ON BEHALF OF PEOPLE IN THE PRISON SYSTEM NO I JUST KNOW THAT THE AUDITOR HAD RECOMMENDED THIS THIS MEASURE TO TAKE PLACE TO ELIMINATE THAT FRAUD FROM HAPPENING. AND I THINK IT'S BECAUSE US AS LEGISLATORS AND IN. INDIVIDUALS AND CONTROL OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS THAT WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PREVENT FRAUD WITHIN THE SYSTEM. IS JUST ONE MEASURE ABSOLUTELY BUT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IN TERMS OF. WITH THIS LIKE A BIG PART OF THE PROBLEM OR A SMALL PART OF THE PROBLEM. SO I DON'T KNOW I'D BE GLAD TO GET THAT INFORMATION BACK TO YOU AND I DO APOLOGIZE I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER FOR THAT FOR YOU. LECTURE MIGHT HAVE A RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTION A SENATOR WARNER IF YOU'RE- HOW MUCH OF THIS ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION BUT I BELIEVE HERE IT STATES THAT. WHILE THE EXACT TOTALS BY KNOWN OR UNKNOWN IN MAY TO STATE PRISONS ALONE HAVE BEEN ESTIMATED TO COMPRISE AT LEAST FOUR HUNDRED MILLION. IS THAT YOUR- OF THE THIRTY OF THE THIRTY ONE BILLION I THINK THAT'S A COMMITTEE ANALYSIS SIR YES YEAH THAT WOULD BE ABOUT ONE LITTLE OVER 1% IS A TALKER. AND I APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTIONS- FOUR HUNDRED MILLION IS STILL FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IT'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY. INTERCOM WATER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I AM. ALSO HAD SIMILAR QUESTIONS I KNOW IN THE AUDIT REPORT THAT WE LOOKED AT MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT THE THEM. LARGE END OF THAT NUMBER THIRTY ONE BILLION WAS THE GLOBAL AMOUNT OF FRAUD NOT NECESSARILY THE FRAUD COMMITTED BY INCARCERATED PERSONS AND I TOO WAS CURIOUS- IF YOU HAD DATA- THAT SHOWS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT INCARCERATED PERSONS RECEIVED WHO WERE INTENTIONALLY- COMMITTING THE FRAUD VERSES THE AMOUNT OF MONEY. THAT WAS- FRAUDULENTLY COLLECTED BY FOLKS USING THE IDENTITY OF INCARCERATED PERSONS- TO RECEIVE BENEFITS BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FOLKS WHO ARE INCARCERATED WHO ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN DEFRAUDING THE SYSTEM AND THEN THOSE THAT ARE ALSO VICTIMS OF IDENTITY THEFT. SO I AGREE I AM I CAN JUST TELL YOU- MESCAL MARKET THAT I SENATOR CALAMARI DEBT AM I JUST BASE THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION ON THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE RECOMMENDATION FROM THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR WAS TO CROSS REFERENCE- LIKE MOST STATES IN THE STATE IN THE NATION ONLY FIFTEEN STATES DON'T INCLUDING CALIFORNIA DON'T CROSS REFERENCE. THERE SO SECURITY NUMBERS- NGUYEN ET D. PAYMENTS ARE ARE GIVEN TO THOSE THAT ARE INCARCERATED AND SO I DID IS I TOOK THIS BE SOLUTION LEGISLATION BASED ON THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS WE IS AN INDEPENDENT AUDITOR THAT MADE THE RECOMMENDATION TO DO A PIECE LEGISLATION TO PREVENT FRAUD. HAS HAS EIGHTY D. GIVEN YOU ANY INDICATION ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO. ACCOMPLISH THIS GIVEN THEIR CURRENT CHALLENGES. M. NOBLE ET DE AT ONE OF THE KEY CHALLENGES THAT WE THAT- THAT WAS ADDRESSED WAS IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO DO IT AT A LOCAL COUNTY JAILS AND SO THAT'S WHY WE TOOK THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS TO ONLY DO AT THE STATE LEVEL AT THIS AT THIS TIME. AND LIKE I SAID WE'RE JUST ONE OF FIFTEEN STATES THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED THIS AND IT WOULD PREVENT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF FRAUD WHETHER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AS THE ESTIMATE IS. IS MINIMAL TO SOME PEOPLE OR SIGNIFICANT. AND THEN MY FINAL QUESTION MISTER CHAIR HAS THE- ACCEPTED. AMENDMENTS REMOVED OPPOSITION FROM INITIATE JUSTICE LEGAL AID AT WORK I HEARD THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE ON THE PHONE BUT HAS IT REMOVED THE OTHER OPPOSITION DO WE KNOW. SO NOT THAT I KNOW OF NO ONE IS CONTACTED MY OFFICE TO REMOVE THAT OPPOSITION- AND AGAIN. IN AN IN THE REAL WORLD I GUESS I WOULD SAY IS HOW EXPLAIN IT I'M A BUSINESS OWNER AND- WE EMPLOYEE. 40% OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE EMPLOYER SECOND CHANCER IS WHAT WE CALL SECOND CHANCE THERE'S THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN INCARCERATED AND WANT TO COME OUT AND HAVE A BETTER LIFE. AND WE'VE HAD A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE COME UP HERE AND TESTIFY AND CERTAIN BILLS SO THIS ISN'T AN ATTACK ON PEOPLE THAT- AND- ARE. IN THE SYSTEM OR THAT ARE TRYING TO GET OUT OF THE SYSTEM AND HAVE BENEFITS AFTER THEY GET OUT WHEN THEY BEEN GAINFULLY EMPLOYED. THIS IS JUST A MECHANISM TO TRY TO LIMIT THE FRAUD BECAUSE THIS FRAUD THAT IS BIGGER THAN WILL BE SUSTAINED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT IS GONNA FONG ON THE BACKS OF A LOT OF OUR SMALL BUSINESSES AND ARE BUSINESS OWNERS. THAT HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING TO THE PANDEMIC BECAUSE IT'S 1100% EMPLOYER FUNDED SO THE MORE FRAUD THAT WE CAN ADDRESS TO REDUCE THAT THE BETTER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS. PICTURE BOOK HERBAL CONCERNED THANK YOU AS CHAIR STRATFORD I AM JUST REALLY QUICK IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AND JUST RECEIVED SOME CLARIFICATIONS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION WAS ACTUALLY AT AN ESTIMATE BACK IN NOVEMBER DECEMBER SO MIGHT BE A LITTLE HIGHER NOW- IN THE OTHER NOTE- THAT WAS I THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING WAS THAT AT THIRTY FIVE STATES ALREADY CROSSMATCH. NORI PRACTICES- IN IN THEIR OWN STATE SO I ACTUALLY- I'M GRATEFUL THAT SENATOR GRAHAM HAS TAKEN THE INITIATIVE IN BRING IT IS FOR THE- AND ANYTIME WE HAVE ANY STATE AGENCY WHERE WE SEE A LOSS OF TAXPAYER MONEY WE SHOULD BE PROACTIVE IN ADDRESSING THE ISSUE ESPECIALLY IN THIS CASE WILL HAVE MANY FAMILIES WHO ARE NOT GETTING THE BENEFITS THAT THEY NEED AND RIGHT NOW ESPECIALLY WITH THE- AS- DOWNTURN IN OUR ECONOMY AND ACCEPT. YEARS IT'S BE US AND IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROTECT OUR TAXPAYERS IT IS WITH THAT- WITH THAT NOTION AND UNDERSTANDING THAT I AM PROUD I'M A PROUD CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL. AND I MOVED THE MOTION WHEN AT THE TIME IS APPROPRIATE. YOU CINA MORE QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS BY THE COMMITTEE SENATOR GROW WHAT YOU LIKE TO CLOSE JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE SIR THANK YOU AND I WOULD JUST LIKE THAT IT'S NO DOUBT THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS- FRAUGHT. ANY LEVEL THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE OVER THE LAST YEAR WITH EDT BUT I TOO AM CONCERNED WITH- JUST BECAUSE IT'S AN MH NAME DOESN'T MEAN HERE SHE ACTUALLY ACTUALLY PARTICIPATED BECAUSE THEY TOO FELL VICTIM OF IDENTITY THEFT SO I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE AMENDMENTS THAT WILL NARAL THIS BILL DOWN AND LEAVE IT TO OUR STATE PRISONS AND NOT AS MUCH TORQUE COUNTY JAIL POPULATION AND I DO UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE ACCEPTED AMENDMENTS YES SIR WE HAVE A MOTION IT TO PASS AND IT WILL BE REFERRED TO REFERRED TO. THE COMMITTEE ON LABOR- IF THAT IS THE MOTION WE ARE WILL NOT I MEAN WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND- MEMBERS SELL PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SB THIRTY NINE TO PASS AS AMENDED TO LABOR PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT RETIREMENT BRADFORD ON RED FOR DIET CHAU BOGUE I HAVE A GUY COME LONGER. NOT VOTING COMMON UP VOTING SKINNER WIENER. FIFTY TWO VOTES DESPITE MEASURE AS TO VOTES WILL LEAVE IT ON CALL FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU HAJDUK'S UP WE HAVE SENATOR RUBIO WITH S. B. TWENTY THREE AND BEFORE WE GET TO CENTER RUBRIC RUBIO I WOULD JUST WANNA MAKE AN OPTION FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CALLING AND- MAKE SURE YOUR DEVICES ARE MUTED- THAT YOU'RE LISTENING TO- THE HEARING ON BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN HAVING TERRIBLE FEEDBACK. AS IT RELATES TO BEING ABLE TO HEAR YOU SO- WHEN IT'S YOUR TURN AND PLEASE MUTE YOUR DEVICE THAT YOU'RE LISTENING TO THE HEARING ON. CENTER RUBIO WHEN YOU'RE READY WE'RE ALL HERE S. B. TWENTY THREE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. TODAY BEFORE I BEGIN I WANTED TO FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU- CHAIR BRADFORD AND THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING SOLD DILIGENT MEET WITH ME TO TRY TO COME TO. AN AGREEMENT SO I WILL BE ACCEPTING OF THE AMENDMENTS OFFERED TODAY I'M HONORED TO PRESENT SB TWENTY THREE WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT BALLOT THAT WOULD STRENGTHEN PROTECTIONS FOR VICTIMS OF REVENGE PORN. SB TWENTY THREE CHANGES THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR REVENGE PORN SO THAT VICTIMS POP CAN TO SEEK JUSTICE DOESN'T START UNTIL AFTER THEY DISCOVERED THE PRINT THAT THE PRIVATE IMAGES HAVE BEEN CAUGHT I'M SORRY THEY'VE GONE PUBLIC. THIS STRAIGHTFORWARD APPROACH IS NEEDED BECAUSE THE CURRENT STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS STARTS THE CLOCK AS SOON AS THE PERPETRATOR MAKES THE IMAGES PUBLIC AND- FAR TOO OFTEN THE VICTIMS DON'T GET TO SEE THAT OR FIND OUT THAT IT'S CIRCULATING TWO YEARS LATER. AND WHAT HAPPENS AT TIMES NOT ONLY OUR CAREER OPPORTUNITIES RENT BUT ALSO FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS THIS HAPPENED RECENTLY TO A VICTIM AND TULARE COUNTY WHEN PROSECUTORS WERE UNABLE TO HELP HER BECAUSE HER PHOTO HAPPENS SHARED LONG BEFORE SHE DISCOVERED THE VIOLATION. AND THE STATUTE OF LIMITATION EXPIRES BEFORE EXPIRED. BEFORE SHE COULD SEEK JUSTICE. AS EARLIER REVENGE PORN HOW DAVIS LONG LASTING EFFECTS ON ON VICTIMS. AND SOMETIMES IT'S PERSONAL AND SOMETIMES IT'S PROFESSIONAL. NONETHELESS WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO HELP SUPPORT THESE VICTIMS AND ENSURE THAT THEY GET THAT THEY GET THE JUSTICE THEY DESERVE. SO THANKFULLY THERE IS. WIDESPREAD SUPPORT FOR THIS ISSUE. AND SO TODAY I AM HONORED TO IT TO HAVE SOME FOLKS TO TESTIFY ON THIS MEASURE. BUT BEFORE I DO I WANTED TO SHARE THAT OTHER CO SPONSORS ARE MARCH AGAINST REVENGE PORN. AND IT'S ALSO SUPPORTED BY A DIVERSE COALITION INCLUDING VICTIMS ORGANIZATIONS LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUPS AND THE INTERNET ASSOCIATION. IF I MAY I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY GUEST SPEAKER HERE TODAY TULARE COUNTY DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY ERICA GONZALEZ. WHICH AND ALSO MARCH AGAINST REVENGE PORN FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR HE LEAH JULIETT THANK YOU. THANK WERE GOING TO ALLOW TWO MINUTES FOR THE BOTH THE PRIMARY WITNESSES- MADAM JUST TURNING WHEN YOU'RE READY YOU MAY BEGIN YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRED BY CHAIRED MEMBERS. MY NAME IS ERICA GONZALEZ I AM A SUPERVISING DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY WITH THE TULARE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE COSPONSORED SB TWENTY THREE. THIS BILL MAKES IT COMMONSENSE CHANGES TO THE CURRENT LAW AND WOULD GIVE VICTIMS OF REVENGE PORN MORE TIME TO SEEK JUSTICE AGAINST THOSE WHO VIOLATE THEIR PRIVACY. UNDER EXISTING LAW THE CRIME OF REVENGE PORN MUST BE PROSECUTED WITHIN ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE THAT THE IMAGE WAS DISTRIBUTED HOWEVER SIMILAR BASED OF CRIME SUCH AS WHEN A PERSON USES A CONCEALED CAMERA TO PHOTOGRAPH ANOTHER PERSON WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT TO CAN BE PROSECUTED WITHIN ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE. OF DISCOVERY. RECENTLY AND TULARE COUNTY A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER DISCOVERED THAT SOMEONE SHE DATED PRIOR TO STARTING HER CAREER AT THE TEACHERS TO GREATLY POSTED PRIVATE PHOTOS OF HER ON THE INTERNET. SHE DID NOT DISCOVER THIS UNTIL THREE YEARS AFTER HE HAD POSTED THE PHOTOS. AND ACT HE ADMITTED TO DOING DURING THE INVESTIGATION. THE INDIVIDUAL WHO POSTED THE PHOTOS WAS EMPLOYED IN A POSITION OF TRUST AND UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF EXISTING LAW. OUR OFFICE COULD NOT PROSECUTE HIM FOR THE CRIME HE COMMITTED. THE VICTIM WAS NOT ABLE TO SEEK JUSTICE AGAINST THE PERSON WHO VIOLATED HER PRIVACY. SHE LIVES IN FEAR THAT OUR STUDENTS SCHOOL ONE DAY DISCOVER THE PHOTOS SHE'S AFRAID OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS ACTIONS AND HER NAME BEING REVEALED. SHE WANTED TO PERSONALLY ADDRESSED THE COMMITTEE TODAY BUT WAS UNABLE TO DO SO BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT GIVE HER STATEMENT ANONYMOUSLY. UNDER EXISTING LAW WE ARE ABLE TO FILE A CASE WITH THE VICTIMS. INITIALS TO PROTECT THEIR PRIVACY. THIS MAKES A TECHNICAL CHANGE THAT ALLOWS A CRIME OF REVENGE PORN TO BE PROSECUTED FROM THE DATE OF DISCOVERY pTHIS CRIME. THE MILLER TO OTHER INTENTIONAL VIOLATION OF PRIVACY CRIMES. ON BEHALF OF THE TULARE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WE ASK THAT YOU STAND WITH VICTIMS OF REVENGE PORN AND SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS.

I'M GOING TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS BYE COMMITTEE SENATOR CALM WATER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAVE A FEW- SO I APPRECIATE THAT CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION. REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION- YEAH I'M NEW TO THIS COMMITTEE- IS THAT THE ONLY OPPOSITION THAT WAS LISTED. IT WAS OKAY- CAN YOU CONFIRM CENTER RUBIO THAT THIS OFFENSE IS A MISDEMEANOR OR WOULD IT BE A FELONY. I WILL HAVE MY- MY GUESS ANSWER THE QUESTION THANK YOU OKAY GREAT AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION WAS I KNOW THAT THE ORIGINAL- LANGUAGE HAD FIFTEEN YEARS- AND I WAS WONDERING HOW THAT NUMBER WAS DETERMINED. WELL IT WAS A JONI TO DEPENDING ON SOME OF THE CASES THAT WE HAD DONE INTERVIEWED AND DISCUSS BY UP BASED ON THE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATION WE DECIDED TO GOAL BASED ON OTHER CRIMES MAKE IT EQUITABLE TO OTHER SIMILAR CRIMES HAVE STATED BY ONE OF THE WITNESSES. AND SO THAT'S WHERE THE SIX YEARS NOW COMES FROM I WOULD A RECOMMENDATION OF THE COMMITTEE OKAY AND THEN- I APOLOGIZE MISTER CHAIR WHAT CONSTITUTES THE DATE OF DISCOVERY OF THE OFFENSE BECAUSE I WAS CONFUSED IF IT WAS. WHEN THE PHOTOS WERE TAKEN OR WHEN THEY WERE RELEASED OR WHEN THEY'RE SORT OF WHEN THEY'VE GONE VIRAL AND I DIDN'T- I. DIDN'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT THANK YOU LAW INITIALLY UP ONCE. CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW WHEN THE PERPETRATOR POST THE PICTURES ONLINE SOLD THERE'S DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS DONE NOW WHEN THE VICTIM TO COME FORWARD WHEN SHE DISCOVERS HE OR SHE DISCOVERS THAT THEY FOUND THE PICTURES ONLINE AND CAN GO DIRECTLY TO. AND SO WHEN IT'S WHEN THE VICTIM DOES WHATEVER IS THE PICTURES ONLINE DISCOVERS THE PHOTOS OR IMAGES OR WHAT IMAGES CORRECT. AND THEN MY FINAL QUESTION SORRY IS DOES THIS INCLUDE ALL CIRCUMSTANCES WERE IMAGERY FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD WAS TAKEN- ARM. OR DOES THIS ALSO INCLUDE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE IMAGES WERE TAKEN WITH THE VICTIM'S CONSENT OR IS IT JUST WHEN IMAGES WERE TAKEN WITHOUT THAT PERSON'S KNOWLEDGE. IT'S ANY IMAGE WITH CONSENT OR WITHOUT CONSENT- AS WE KNOW IF I MAY SHARE- YOU KNOW SOMETIMES PEOPLE IN A RELATIONSHIP FOR IT WHAT'S A PRIVATE MOMENT AND LATER IT'S DONE WITH MALICIOUS INTENT AND I WANTED TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT FURTHER I MEAN THEIR STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE THAT SHOW THAT 50% OF THE VICTIMS. HAVE SUICIDAL THOUGHTS ON WHETHER IT'S CONSENT OR NOT IT'S STILL EXTREMELY TRAUMATIZING USUALLY AS I BELIEVE WE HEARD FROM THE WITNESS SHE WAS A TEENAGER AND IT COULD HAVE LONG LASTING EFFECTS ON PEOPLE THERE SOMEONE'S DAUGHTER SOMEONE'S MOTHER AND DEPENDING ON THE TIME LINE AT SOMEONE'S GRANDMOTHER'S CELL. EVEN WITH CONSENT IT IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD NOT BE DONE AND VICTIMS ARE REALLY STRUGGLING. AND SUFFERING THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT TRAUMA. SO THEN IF. I FOR EXAMPLE OF I'M IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEONE AND WE DID. YOU KNOW ENGAGED IN SOME ACTIVITY WHERE WE'RE TAKING PHOTOS- AND IF I SHARE WITH CLOSE FRIENDS I CAN DO THAT BUT THEN IF THE PARTNER SHARES WITH FRIENDS. THE THEY CAN'T DO THAT OR IT COULD BE CONSIDERED WELL IN ADVANCE I AM I MEAN I HEAR WHERE YOU'RE YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS BUTIT'S INTENDED TO REALLY PROTECT THOSE PRIVATE MOMENTS THAT PEOPLE HAVE WITH THEIR- INTIMATE PARTNERS AND TYPICALLY THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE LONG LASTING EFFECTS ON. ON INDIVIDUALS YOU KNOW EITHER AT THE RELATIONSHIP ENDS OR THEY FIND THAT THE FOUND ANY RELATIONSHIP AND THAT'S WHAT'S CALLED A REVENGE PORN IT'S MEANT TO TAKE REVENGE AND READY TO DAMAGE THE REPUTATION OF AN INDIVIDUAL. I THINK CONSULTANT KENNEDY WANTED TO ELABORATE ON. THE I WAS JUST GOING TO HELP CLARIFY THE IT IS UPON DISCOVERY AND THEN THE MEMO WAS DISCOVERY OR SIX YEARS AT THE SEVEN YEARS AFTERWARDS. THEY HAVE TO DO IT WITHIN ONE YEAR OF DISCOVERY BRING ACTION WITHIN ONE YEAR OF DISCOVERY. AND THE DISCOVERY IS WHEN THE PERSON REALIZE IT'S BEEN SHARED WITHOUT PERMISSION. AND IN YOUR SCENARIO WHERE THEY SHARE WITH THEIR FRIENDS IF THE FRIEND SHARED. THEN THAT WOULD BE WITHOUT PERMISSION. SO YOU CAN SHARE PICTURES OF YOURSELF WITH SOMEONE BUT THEN ONCE THEY GO BEYOND THAT IS ONE IT'S- THE REVENGE PORN. BUT I SURE I CAN DO THAT IF I SHARE WITH MY FRIENDS AND THEY DO THAT THEY CAN'T DO THAT IF I SHARE WITH MY PARTNER AT THE TIME AND WE CONSENT TO SHARE BUT THEN WE BREAK UP AND THAT'S NOT PARTNER SHARES THAN THAT WOULD BE THE VIOLATION. THE MISDEMEANOR THAT'S AT THE EXISTING LINE MISTRESSES CHANGING THE STATURE LIMITATIONS. TWO ONE YEAR AFTER DISCOVERY OR AT THE MAX SIX YEARS THEIR DEFINITION. THAT DEFINES AND DELINEATES WHAT REVENGE IS AND HOW THAT'S CONSTITUTED. I DON'T THINK THERE HAS TO BE INTENT BEHIND IT. I'M JUST ASKING BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT I THREE SLOPE. AND THEN YOU KNOW I DO I JUST LIKE TO HAVE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WHEN WE'RE WINNING MOTION IS INCLUDED. AND THIS IS JUST AN EXTENSION OF EXISTING LAW ALREADY BECAUSE THE LAW IS ALREADY IN PLACE FOR ONE YEAR SO IT'S TAKING THAT ONE YEAR THAT'S ALREADY IN PLACE AND JUST GIVING VICTIMS A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME. SAME SITUATION JUST LONGER BUT BASED ON THE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATION IT CAN'T GO ON FOREVER THERE'S A CAP IT SIX YEARS SELL LET'S SY THE VICTIM CLAIMS TO HAVE FOUND OUT SEVEN YEARS LATER. IT'S NO LONGER APPLICABLES. IT'S REFERRED TO AS REVENGE PORN BUT THAT'S NOT REFERRED TO IN THE STATUTE IT'S A PERSON INTENTIONALLY DISTRIBUTES AN IMAGE OF THE INTIMATE BODY PARTS OF ANOTHER. OR THE PERSON DEPICTED IN A SEX ACT UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THE PERSON AGREED OR UNDERSTOOD THAT THE IMAGE WOULD REMAIN PRIVATE. AND THE PERSON KNOWING KNOWINGLY DISTRIBUTED IT KNOWING IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PRIVATE. SEVEN IMAGES SHARE WITH JUST A FRIEND OR JUST A PARTNER THAT THEN GET SHARED BEYOND THAT. K. CENTER TOLD VOGUE. SENATOR REID THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS ISSUE TO THE FOREFRONT AND HAVING THESE DISCUSSIONS I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT AS A MOTHER OF DAUGHTERS AND A SON AND UNDERSTANDING THEIR FRIENDS AND THEIR ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH OUR CHILDREN ARE GROWING UP IN- SPECIALLY WITH SOCIAL MEDIA- I IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE LIMITS ARE SPECIALLY WHEN THERE IS ILL INTENT AND THAT IN THAT ENDEAVOR SO WITH THAT IN MIND I WILL BE HAPPILY SUPPORTING YOUR BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT- THIS IS NOT ONLY APPLY TO WOMEN APPLIES TO MEN AS WELL SO WE CAN BE A SIGN OF FATHER OR GRANDFATHER BECAUSE THAT'S CORRECT IN YOUR PRESENTATION YOU. JUST PREFER TO. FEMALE SO JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR FOR THE GENTLEMAN YOU'RE COVERED HERE AS WELL. GOOD POINT SENATOR. AT THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION YES- OKAY- THE NOTE SENATOR RUBIO WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE I HAVE WELL I'M SORRY I'M SORRY CENTER SKINNER- FIVE BYE BOTH APPRECIATE THE EXPANSION OF THE TIME PERIOD BUT I ALSO APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENT BECAUSE I THINK THAT THESE ARE- IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO PROVE ONCE TIME GETS OFF TO MUCH PAST HOWEVER WITH SUCH A SHORT PERIOD AS THE EXISTING STATUTE WAS HAS INDICATED THE TESTIMONY. YOU CAN ALSO NOT BE ABLE TO- ACT ON IT IN THERE SO MANY REASONS WHY YOU MAY NOT DISCOVERED RIGHT AWAY OR YOU MAY BE INTIMIDATED. BY THE INDIVIDUAL OR ANY NUMBER OF THINGS SO I THINK THAT WE'VE REACHED A GOOD OF A MIDDLE GROUND ON WHAT THE APPROPRIATE YEARS ARE AND- I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT WITH THAT. THANK YOU. NOW SENATOR RUBIO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE ON S. B. TWENTY THREE YES WELL FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR A FOR THIS DISCUSSION I KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT TO REALLY GET INTO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE BILL BUT- I JUST WANTED IT ALSO JUST REITERATE THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS STILL THERE YOU CAN'T JUST MAKE ALLEGATIONS WE STILL HAVE TO. TRUTHDIG OUR OUR CASE OR IN THIS CASE THE VICTIM'S CASE- AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING THIS AND JUST REALLY QUICK I'LL SHARE YOU NOT. AS AND WHEN I WAS A TEACHER AND I HAVE FIFTH GRADERS AND- AND SOME OF OUR CHILDREN ALREADY TAKING INAPPROPRIATE PICTURES AND CELL. I THINK THIS JUST HELPS. YOU KNOW- INFORM THE DISCUSSION AND HAVE A LARGER DISCUSSION ABOUT. YOU KNOW IF WE CAN AVOID IT AND MAKE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW INDIVIDUALS AND ALL THAT WHAT COULD HAPPEN I JUST THINK IT ONLY HELPS AS IT MOVES FORWARD WITH TECHNOLOGY BEING SO. PREVALENT OUR CAMINO EVERYTHING IS ONLINE SO WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S- THAT WE INFORM THE PUBLIC OF WHAT IT IS AND WHAT CAN POTENTIALLY HAPPEN SO I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND I WANT TO THANK YOU. FOR YOUR AMENDMENTS AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR- VOTE THANK YOU. I THINK YOU WERE LOOKING FOR A MOTION IT SHOULD DO PASSED TO BE. RE REFER TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AND UNDERSTAND THAT SENATOR RUBIO HAS TAKEN AMENDMENTS. THE COMMITTEE AMEND. THE MOVED. HAS BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR CHOI BALK. PLEASE CONSULT AND PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON TWENTY TWENTY THREE AT THREE TWENTY THREE DO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS BRADFORD. BRADFORD AYE AND CHOKE HI JOE BOAKAI COM LONGER. A AYE SKINNER BY INNER AYE WIENER. WIENER HI FIVE ZERO. THROUGH THE MEASURES OUT FIVE ZERO GRADUATIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. NOW MOVING ON. ALL. ZERO OTHER. SENATOR SKINNER ARE YOU PREPARED TO PRESENT. SB. EIGHTY ONE. YES. ALREADY WONDERFUL. THANK YOU- CHAIRED MEMBERS SB EIGHTY ONE- I HAD THE GREAT PLEASURE OF SERVING FOR THE LAST YEAR ON A COMMITTEE THAT THE GOVERNOR ESTABLISHED THE COMMITTEE ON THE REVIEW OF CALIFORNIA'S PENAL CODE AND CONDUCT COMMITTEE WERE- A NUMBER OF JUDGES. SOME LEGISLATORS- DEAN OF CALIFORNIA WERE PREEMINENT LAW SCHOOL THE UC IRVINE AND A NUMBER OF OTHER- EXPERTS IN ADVOCATES WITHIN OF THIS SPACE- AND WE HELD A SERIES OF MEETINGS OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR WITH LOTS OF STAKEHOLDERS AND WHAT WE WERE DOING IS LOOKING AT CALIFORNIA'S PENAL CODE IN THE LAST THIRTY THIRTY FIVE YEARS HAS GROWN TREMENDOUSLY WE HAVE A- NEW CRIMES IN NEW CATEGORIES OF CRIMES A NEW ALL KINDS OF THINGS. FOR EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN AND THERE WAS THE SENSE BY OUR FORMER GOVERNOR GOVERNOR BROWN AND OTHERS THAT WE REALLY NEEDED TO RE LOOK AT IT IN A KIND OF COMPREHENSIVE WAY SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WERE DOING. AND IN AN ISSUE THAT CAME BEFORE US WAS THE ISSUE OF WHAT'S CALLED SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS NOW SENSING HANSON'S ARE NOT ELEMENTS OF A BASIC CRIME. SO YOU COMMIT A CRIME. SENATE HARASSMENT RATHER OUR EDITION CIRCUMSTANCES THAT A PROSECUTOR CAN ARGUE FOR. AND THEN INCREASE THE PENALTY THAT THE PERSON WHO. WOULD BE IN BE ADDED TO THE PENALTY THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE UNDERLYING CRIME. CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA'S PENAL CODE THERE ARE OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ENHANCEMENTS. AND OVER 80% OF THE PEOPLE CURRENTLY SERVING IN OUR STATE PRISONS ARE HAVE HAD DEER BASED SENTENCE OF THE SENTENCE BASED ON THE FOR THE ORIGINAL OR THE CRIME THAT THEY COMMITTED. BLANK SENT DUE TO ENHANCEMENTS AND RESEARCH SHOWS AND WE HAD LOTS OF- THERE WAS LOTS OF DATA PRESENTED TO US THERE'S A VARIETY OF RESEARCHERS WHO'VE BEEN COLLECTING DATA ON OF ON VARIOUS THINGS RELATED TO CALIFORNIA'S PENAL CODE. RESEARCH SHOWED THAT THERE'S AN INCONSISTENCY IN THE APPLICATION OF THESE ENHANCEMENTS SO FOR EXAMPLE CALIFORNIA HAS A GANG LAST. THAT CAN BE REFERRED TO FOR WHEN SOMEONE ADDS A GANG ENHANCEMENT BUT IN THAT GAME CAL GANG REPORT. OF OVER FOUR HUNDRED FORTY FIVE THOUSAND IN THE DATABASE. ONLY APPROXIMATELY THREE THOUSAND OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE CAUCASIAN. NOW THERE ARE A GOOD NUMER OF WHEN WE LOOK AT THE DEFINITION OF GANGS GANGS THAT ACROSS THE BOARD GANGS OF THAT ARE PRIMARILY CAUCASIAN PEOPLE GETTING SORT OF PRIMARILY. BLACK INDIVIDUALS GANGS THAT ARE PRIMARILY FLAT NEXT GAMES THAT ARE PRIMARILY API HOWEVER. THE GANG REPORT. IS DOMINANTLY DOMINANTLY NON CAUCASIAN NOW ON AVERAGE THE ENHANCEMENTS UNDER PENAL CODE. AND THAT THEN GET APPLIED CAN MORE THAN DOUBLE THE ORIGINAL SENTENCE OF THE WHATEVER THE BASE CRIME WAS COMMITTED. AND IF WE THINK ABOUT. OUR PURPOSES OF INCARCERATION. YES PART OF IT IS TO HAVE A PENALTY FOR A CRIME COMMITTED BUT INITIALLY WE ARE TRYING TO CREATE SOME REHABILITATION. AND THE LONGER A PERSON SERVICE NUMBER ONE IT'S A GREAT COST TO US OUR COSTS FOR INCARCERATION HOURS UPWARDS TO EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND PER PERSON. AND IT HAS HUGE IMPACTS ON THE FAMILIES OF THE INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE YOU'VE REMOVED A POTENTIAL EARNINGS EARNED- PERSON THAT COULD EARN WAGES FROM THE HOUSEHOLD YOU'VE ALSO. REMOVED POTENTIALLY APPARENT FROM CHILDREN AND SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS SO WE WANT TO IT IS SMART FOR US TO RELOOK AT OUR PENAL CODE AND LOOK AT OUR WE APPROPRIATELY SENTENCING. SO WHAT- DURING THAT COMMITTEE THAT I SERVED ON WE HAD A VARIETY OF DA'S TESTIFY AND SO FOR EXAMPLE SANTA CLARA DA JEFF ROSEN'S IN TESTIMONY TO US ABOUT ENHANCEMENTS SAID THAT IT IS QUITE COMMON NOW DUE TO THE NUMBER OF ENHANCEMENTS IN OUR PENAL CODE THAT THE ENTIRE TRIAL AND ALL OF THE PRE TRIAL NEGOTIATIONS END UP SOLELY ABOUT THE ENHANCEMENTS AND NOT. THE CRIME ITSELF. NOW MANY STATES HAVE BEGUN TO REFORM THEIR ENHANCEMENT PROCESS SEES. WHAT THIS BILL DOES SB EIGHTY ONE IS IT DOES NOT ELIMINATE ANY ENHANCEMENT THEY ALL STAY ON THE BOOKS RATHER IT GIVES MORE GUIDANCE TO OUR JUDGES IN HOW TO APPLY THEM. SO THAT THERE IS SO THAT WE CAN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE REMOVE THE KIND OF ARBITRARINESS OF APPLYING ENHANCEMENT BECAUSE THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY SOME CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE AN ENHANCEMENT IS APPROPRIATE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ENSURE IS THAT WHEN THE ENHANCEMENT IS APPLIED IT'S APPLIED APPROPRIATELY. SO WHAT IT DOES IS. GIVE THE JUDGE SOME OF FRAMEWORK SO THAT THEY'RE APPLYING AN ENHANCEMENT WHEN THERE'S CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT TO NOT APPLY IT YOU WOULD BE ENDANGERING THE PUBLIC. SO YOU WOULD FOR EXAMPLE. YOU WOULD USE MORE DISK NOT LESS DISCRETION ANOTHER WORDS MORE AND MORE CLARITY IF THAT WAS A NONVIOLENT OFFENSE FOR EXAMPLE IF IT WAS AN OFFENCE CONNECTED TO A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE. IF THE ENHANCEMENT WAS BASED ON A CONVICTION THAT WAS PRIOR TO FIVE YEARS AGO AND THERE HAD BEEN NO CONVICTIONS IN THE MEAN TIME OR IF THE DEFENDANT WAS A USED. BY JUVENILES WHEN THEY COMMITTED THE OFFENSE- SO THAT'S THE THAT THAT IS SOME OF THE GUIDANCE THAT SB EIGHTY ONE IS TRYING TO PUT INTO STATUTE SO THAT. THERE'S LESS ARBITRARINESS TO THE USE OF ENHANCEMENTS AND OUR JUDGES CAN FEEL MORE CONFIDENT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT IS LEFT. DEAD IT IS VERY- THERE'S NOT CLEARED FOR WHEN TO APPLY THEM SAROD LIKE TO NOW HAVE MY- A WITNESS WHO IS ONE OF THE PERSONS WHO SERVED ON THE COMMISSION WITH ME AS DID ANOTHER COLLEAGUE HERE ON THE COMMITTEE- AND THAT IS JUDGE PETER ESPINOSA. AND JUDGE ESPINOZA WAS APPOINTED TO THE BENCH BY OUR GOVERNOR FORMER GOVERNOR PETE WILSON. BUT HE SERVED ON THE THIS PENAL CODE REVIEW COMMITTEE AND- HEARD ALL THE TESTIMONY AND OF COURSE OBVIOUSLY AS A JUDGE HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO VARIOUS OF MANY MANY MANY MANY TRIALS WHERE ENHANCEMENTS TO OUR FUTURE. SO IF WE COULD TURN OUT TO JUDGE ESPINOZA. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS AB TWO MINUTE. I THINK HE'S MY ONLY WITNESS- CENTER BRADFORD SO. THIS IS. YOU'RE ASKING FOR MENTAL YOU MAY NOT NEED FOR HOURS BUT IT IS NOT. HOPEFULLY HERE JUST FROM THOSE ARE YOU PREPARED. ARE ON THE LINE. MODERATOR DO WE HAVE. MISTRESS FOR THOSE WITH. YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE JUST I MEAN IF YOU'RE AT ALL. THAT'S MY FAULT I TEND TO SPEAK FREQUENTLY WHILE I'M ON MUTE CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES WE CAN HELLO. YES OKAY GREAT MY NAME'S BEEN ARRESTED ALSO HAS INTRODUCED BY SENATOR SKINNER I SPENT TWENTY FIVE YEARS ON THE L. A. COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT. INCLUDING TWO YEARS OF SUPERVISING JUDGE OF THE CRIMINAL DIVISION- I WAS PROUD TO SERVE WITH HER ON THE PENAL CODE REVISION COMMITTEE- WHERE WE- TRY TO BRING SOME CLARITY TO THE PENAL CODE AS SHE INDICATED. CREATES SOME ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION AND LOOK AT THE PENAL CODE TO RACIAL JUSTICE LANDS. FROM. ROUSE SB EIGHTY ONE FOR- I'M HERE TO SPEAK ON. SEND YOUR SKINNER. ON THE TRYING NOT SURE MUCH OF WHAT SHE HAS ALL SAID A- PETITION THE NEW. THE PEOPLE. INTO HAS A ONE AND FIFTY ENHANCE. 80% OF PEOPLE AND CDC ARE CURRENTLY SERVING A TERM LINCOLN BY AN ENHANCEMENT. MORE THAN 25% OF PRISONERS OF HAVE THEIR SINCE THE STANDARD BY WHICH WE ARE MORE ANTIOXIDANTS. THAN ON AVERAGE THE ENHANCEMENT DOUBLES A PERSON SENTENCE. INSTEAD PRISON. I THINK IT AND CALM WHEN DEALING WITH US. ENHANCEMENT THROUGH EQUITY LET. TEMPOR TO NOTE NINETIES PER OF PEOPLE SERVING. PRISON SENTENCE FOR GAINING HIM OR OF. 89% OF PEOPLE SAY A PRISON SENTENCE THE GUN- PEOPLE COLOR. 75% NON BY AGAINST- PEOPLE COLOR. AND SEVENTY SEVEN. PERCENT OF PER SHARE MISSILE BE OF COLOR COLOR. WE HER ON THE ISSUE OF CONSENTING TWINS FROM A NUMBER OF WHAT IN. FORMER GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN SANTA CLARA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY JEFF ROSEN THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY GEORGE GASC ON AND ALL OF THEM IN VARIOUS WAYS- JUST TO LOOK AT THE USE OF SENTENCING ENHANCEMENTS. THAT APPLIES TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON SYSTEM. WE LOOKED AT A LOT OF EMPIRICAL RESEARCH AND DATA AND OTHER STRUCTURAL SENTIMENTS AMONG RESEARCHERS THE LONG SENTENCES HAVE LITTLE OR NO IMPACT ON PUBLIC SAFETY. YEAH STUDIES SHOWN THAT A PERSON'S CRIMINAL INVOLVEMENT TENDS TO BE LIMITED TO A PERIOD OF LESS THAN TEN YEARS. WHEN THEY TEND TO REACH OUT. OF THEIR CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR TO ALL STATES ALREADY HAVE CUT OUT DATES ARE WASHOE PROVISIONS AFTER WHICH CRIMINAL HISTORY. AND NOT BE USED TO EXTEND THE SENTENCE INCLUDING ARIZONA FLORIDA ILLINOIS IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON. IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT ALL OF THE WORK THAT WE DID ON THE PENAL CODE REVISION COMMISSION WAS DONE THROUGH. NOT ONLY THE RACIAL EQUITY LOUNGE- BUT A PUBLIC SAFETY LANDS. IN HANSEN'S CAN ALREADY BE DISMISSED BY JUDGES BUT THE CURRENT STANDARD IN FURTHERANCE OF JUSTICE THE SENATOR SKINNER HAS INDICATED HIS WAY. CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS RULED TO THIS. HAS REFERRED TO THE STANDARDS AND MORE FOR THIS CONCEPT. THE GOAL SENATE BILL EIGHTY ONE IS TO GET A JUDGE'S MORE GUIDANCE ON WHEN THEY SHOULD DISMISS- ENHANCEMENTS BY ESTABLISHING A PRESUMPTION THAT THE TOO SOON TO SELL. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. AGAIN THE CONSIDERATION OF PUBLIC% SAFETY REMAINS THE OVERRIDING CONCERN IN A JUDGE CAN QUITE EASILY MAKE A RECORD THAT CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE. CHOIRS AND ENHANCE WOULD BE USED IN A SENTENCE BLANCA BY THE USE OF THAT ENHANCE. WELL I'M I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS BUT- THAT'S MY STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF. THANK YOU.

WE'VE ALREADY TAKEN PRIMARY TESTIMONY LOW WE'RE JUST TAKING THOSE INDIVIDUALS BOTH FOREIGN AND AGAINST THAT JUST STATE YOUR NAME IN OUR ORGANIZATION. WE ARE PRIMARY WITNESS ALREADY IN OPPOSITION HARD TESTIFIED. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL GO TO LINE OF OUR LINES SIXTY EIGHT YOUR LINE IS OPEN. HELLO MY NAME IS NICHOLA AND I. EIGHTY ONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE NEXT OF A LINE OF TWO FIFTY FIVE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. I MEAN IT'S EASY. TO USE HIGH HOLIDAY THAT JUST CALLED AND I'M ACTUALLY CALLING IN SUPPORT OF. THE EIGHTY ONE NOT OPPOSITION. THEY JUST CALLED THANK YOU. AND WE HAVE NO MORE FOR THEIR OPPOSITION TO IN Q. THREE OKAY I'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS VIA COMMITTEE MEMBERS SURE. IT'S BEEN PROPERLY MOVES VISOR WINNER. SURE I HAD A QUESTION- OKAY CENTER OCHO A BOOK SORRY- SENATORS SKINNER JUST A QUICK QUESTION ON NOT- IS THIS A MANDATE FOR JUDGES OR IS THIS A- SUGGESTION. IT FOR IT ACTUALLY- DIRECTS THE JUDGE UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS FOR THE PARAMETERS FOR THE APPLICATION OF THE ENHANCEMENT SO IT'S A MUST THEY MUST FOLLOW THESE PROTOCOLS CORRECT CORRECT BECAUSE THERE WERE NO THE POINT AS MY WITNESS TESTIFIED SINCE THERE WERE NO THERE WAS NO GUIDANCE AND NO PROTOCOLS WE'VE HAD THIS VERY THIS SIGNIFICANT DISPARITY IN WHO HAS RECEIVING THE ENHANCEMENTS ESPECIALLY. THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE RECEIVED THREE OR MORE AS INDICATED THERE ARE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ENHANCEMENTS ON THE BOOKS SO ANY INDIVIDUAL CAN HAVE DEPENDING ON WHAT THE PROSECUTOR DESIRES CAN TRY TO LEVY UPWARDS SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE MORE ENHANCEMENTS ON ADDITION TO THE BASIC CRIME. SO WITH THIS GUIDANCE DOES IS THE ONLY WAY THAT THE JUDGE COULD DISMISS IT IS IF THERE IS A- RATHER TO. THE JUDGE WOULD NEED TO USE THE ENHANCEMENT IF. THERE'S A CLEAR THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY BY NOT APPLYING THE ENHANCEMENT SO PUBLIC SAFETY WHAT WE ARE DOING IN THE DESIGN OF EIGHTY ONE IS PUTTING PUBLIC SAFETY FIRST AND FOREMOST. WOULD YOU SAY THE ENHANCEMENTS ARE IN TRYING TO FORMULATE MY THOUGHTS HERE THE ENHANCEMENTS ARE. A NEGATIVE THING IT DEPENDS IT DEPENDS ON A YOU KNOW WE HAVE WE HEARD ABOUT CASES FOR EXAMPLE IN THE PENAL CODE REVIEW COMMITTEE WHERE. AN WE KNOW THAT- TO BASICALLY MOST CALIFORNIANS ARE MOST AMERICANS OWN GUNS AND IT IS VERY COMMON FOR A PERSON TO HAVE A GUN IN THEIR CAR. NOW WHAT HAPPENS IS A PERSON WITH A GUN IN THEIR CAR. IS THEN ARRESTED FOR TOTALLY DIFFERENT CRIME BUT THE PRESENCE OF THE GUN IN THE CAR EVEN IF NOT USED OR POTENTIALLY EVEN IF NOT LOADED CAN ADD ADD A GUN ENHANCEMENT TO THAT BASIC CRIME. BUT WHAT WE SAW ON THE DATA. IS THAT FOR EXAMPLE IF I WERE THE PERSON WHO COMMITTED THE CRIME. AND HAD THE GUN IN MY CAR BUT I DIDN'T USE THE GUN IN THE CAR IN THEIR CRIME BUT I HAD TO GO TO THE CAR. THAT IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY FOR ME TO GET THAT ENHANCEMENT ADDED. WHEREAS IF. I WERE. BLACK OR BROWN FOR EXAMPLE. AGAIN SAME CIRCUMSTANCES EXACT SAME CIRCUMSTANCES. I MIGHT HAVE BEGUN ENHANCEMENT USED. ON MY IN IN MY IN THE PROSECUTION SODA SUPPLIED TO THE SENTENCE OF WHATEVER MY OTHER CRIME WAS. SURE THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER. CENTER CALM WATER. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER FOR- THIS BILL I JUST AS I A COLLEAGUE WHO SERVED ON THE PENAL CODE REVISION COMMITTEE WITH YOU WANTED JUST- YOU KNOW ELEVATE SOME OF YOUR POINTS THAT YOU KNOW ENHANCEMENTS ARE REALLY SEEN AS SENTENCE ADDITIVES. SO YOU ARE MIGHT BE CHARGED I'M AND THEN THE PROSECUTOR HAS THE ABILITY TO ADD ENHANCEMENTS TO THE ORIGINAL CHARGE AND WHAT WE HAVE SEEN AND WHAT WE LEARNED THROUGH EXHAUSTIVE TESTIMONY IS THAT OFTENTIMES INSPECT IN MOST INSTANCES- THOSE ENHANCEMENTS ARE SORT OF- CHARGED DISCRIMINANT LEE- AND ALSO VERY HAPHAZARDLY WITHOUT CLEAR DIRECTION AND GUIDELINES. FOR WHICH A JUDGE CAN USE IN ORDER TO DECIDE WHEN IT IS APPROPRIATE TO ACCEPT AN ENHANCEMENT AND WHEN IT ISN'T. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS OFTENTIMES WITH GANG ENHANCEMENTS WE WILL SEE MEMBERS WHO ARE IN. WHO MIGHT BE CHARGED WITH A PARTICULAR CRIME AND THEN THEY WILL HAVE A GANG ENHANCEMENT YOU KNOW ADDED TO THAT CHARGE WHEN THEY'RE BLACK AND BROWN YOU'LL HAVE MEMBERS WHO ARE ALSO IN GANGS AND LIKE THE ARIAN BROTHERHOOD THE MAYBE UP ON PARTICULAR YOU KNOW EVERYONE MAY BE UP ON A DRUG CHARGE. THAT PARTICULAR PERSON WHO pBROTHERHOOD GANG IS NOT LEVIED AN ADDITIONAL GANG ENHANCEMENT AND SO WHEN YOU HAVE THAT KIND OF SORT OF HAPHAZARD- DISCRETION- BY A PROSECUTOR IN CONCERT WITH THE JUDGE. LEVYING THESE ENHANCEMENTS WHICH ADD IMPORTANT AMOUNTS OF TIME TO SOMEONE- IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE GUIDELINES THAT ALLOW YOU TO SORT OF BE MORE EQUITABLE OR AT LEAST TO BE FAIR AND HOW ENHANCEMENTS ARE GIVEN OUT- THAT'S WHY I THINK THE AG STOP USING THE GANG DATABASE THAT'S WHY A NUMBER OF SORT OF ACTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OVER THE COURSE OF THE PAST YEAR BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN HOW. REYES SAYS BUT JUST HOW AN EQUITABLE THE ENHANCEMENTS ARE LEVY SO I JUST WANT TO SORT OF. SHARE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT GIVEN MY EXPERIENCE ON THE COMMITTEE AND THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE HAD AROUND THIS IT'S HOW TO GIVE VERY CLEAR GUIDELINES TO JUDGES. ON HOW TO USE ENHANCEMENTS- YOU CAN HAVE ANOTHER DISCUSSION OF IF IT ENCAMPMENTS ARE EVEN APPROPRIATE BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. MERRY GO SO DO WE HAVE ANY M. HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING FROM THE JUDGES AND HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THESE GUIDANCE- WILL YOU HEARD FROM A- PERSON WHO SERVED TWENTY FIVE YEARS ON THE BENCH AS MY MAIN WITNESS IN SUPPORT. AND WHO- AND- WE COULD ALWAYS BRING HIM BACK IF THAT WERE OKAY WITH SURE BUT HE BASICALLY. HE EXPRESSED ANOTHER JUDGE WE HAD OTHER JUDGES ALSO ON THE COMMITTEE EXPRESSED THAT THEY OFTEN FELT IN THIS IN THIS KIND OF. DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCE FORT BECAUSE THERE WERE THERE WASN'T REAL GUIDANCE AND- YOU KNOW WHEN THERE'S REAL PUSH FROM THE PROSECUTOR TO USE ENHANCEMENTS. THEN IT SORT OF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DON'T COOL WHAT IS THE PARAMETERS FOR THE JUDGE'S DISCRETION SO THEY WERE I MEAN THE REASON THAT- JUDGES BEEN RECEIVING TESTIFIED TODAY'S BECAUSE OF HOW STRONGLY FOR EXAMPLE HE FEELS ABOUT THIS. THAT HE FEELS THAT IT REALLY DOES. NEED TO HAVE SOME CLEAR PARAMETERS THAT JUDGES NEED THAT GUIDANCE- AND I KNOW THAT YOU DIDN'T ASK THIS QUESTION SO MY APOLOGIES FOR SAYING IT BUT I WANTED TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THIS DOES NOT CHANGE. THE CHARGE OF THE BASE CRIME WHATSOEVER IN ANY WAY NOR THE PENALTY RELATED TO THE BASE CRIME NOR DOES IT ELIMINATE ANY OF THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY ENHANCEMENTS THERE ARE OTHER BILLS AND OTHER BILLS BOTH OF IN THE PAST AND CURRENTLY THIS YEAR THAT OUR- PURPOSE IS TO ELIMINATE A PARTICULAR ENHANCEMENT. THIS BILL IS MUCH MORE IS ENTIRELY AND SOLELY DESIGNED TO GIVE GUIDANCE TO THE JUDGE. THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER- THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS QUESTIONS BY COMMITTEE. ARTS CENTER SKINNER I WANT THANK YOU FOR THIS MEASURE AGAIN LET'S BE VERY CLEAR THIS BILL BY KNOWN STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION REMOVES THE ENHANCEMENTS THAT CURRENTLY EXIST IT SIMPLY GIVES BETTER GUIDELINES AS TO WHEN IT IS APPROPRIATE TO APPLY. THOSE ENHANCEMENTS- N. AS SHEARED HISTORY SHOWN THAT THOSE THESE ENHANCEMENTS ARE USUALLY APPLIED IN A VERY UNEQUALLED MATTER WHEN IT COMES TO RACE AND- AND- ECONOMICS AS WELL THAT PLAYS A MAJOR ROLE AS WELL IT'S OFTEN STATED IT'S BETTER TO BE. GUILTY AND RICH AND POOR INNOCENT SO AND WE SEE THOSE ENHANCEMENTS ONLY- HAPPEN HAPPENS TO NOT BE TO YOUR CRIME AND ANY KIND OF WAY. NO ONE'S THINKING ABOUT IF IN FACT WHEN THEY'RE COMMITTING A CRIME THAT I'M GONNA GET AN ENHANCEMENT THAT'S GOING TO DETER THAT ACTION SO TO CONTINUE TO TELL PEOPLE'S LIVES AWAY WHEN WE COULD. BE BETTER SERVED IN TRYING TO PROVIDE THEM A- REHABILITATIVE A CHANCE OF DOING AS SENATOR SKINNER SAYS THE BASELINE CRIME IF IT'S FIVE YEARS SENTENCE THEY WILL DO THAT TIME AND HOPEFULLY THAT TIME THEY'VE LEARNED FROM THEIR WAYS VERSUS. WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN FIVE TURNS INTO FIFTEEN YEARS AND WHAT YOU HAVE THEN IS A HARDENED CRIMINAL WHO COMES OUT WITH LITTLE HOLE MANY TIMES OF BEING A CONTRIBUTING MEMBER TO SOCIETY BUT AGAIN I'VE TALKED TO PLENTY JUDGES AND THEY APPRECIATE. BOB ABILITY FOR CLARITY AND GIVEN THEM THE PARAMETERS ARE WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE- TO USE OR NOT BUT IT DOESN'T REMOVE THE ENHANCEMENTS AT ALL JUST GIVE THE JUDGE AGREED AUTHORITY ONE ONE HOUR IF NOT TO APPLY SO ON THAT NOTE- WERE. LOOKING FOR A MOTION TO DO PASS. WELL WITH THE MEMONS. JEFF ALTARUM. ON THIS ONE NO MANAGEMENT ON THE OTHER OKAY I'M SORRY THE NEXT ONE I GET TO SKINNER BILLS FROM- IS DUE TO PER- SEEKING A MOTION ON THAT. I THOUGHT. ARE GOT CENTER WINNER DID MAKE A MOTION. FIFTIES TO WILL CALL THE ROLL ON S. EIGHTY TO PAY TO. SB EIGHTY D. PASTOR. BRADFORD ON RED FOR DIET CHOI BOGUE. NOT VOTING OKAY. IN TROUBLE NOT VOTING LAGER KAMAGRA SKINNER BY SKINNER AYE WIENER. WIENER AYE VOTES FOR ZERO. BILL IS OUT INTEREST THAT MEASURES OUT FOR THE ZERO NOW IF YOU'RE PREPARED WILL MOVE TO S. B. EIGHTY TWO YES THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIRMAN OVER SO THIS IS ANOTHER. BILL THAT IS ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAME FROM- COMMITTEE ON THE REVISION OF THE PENAL CODE NOW WHAT THIS BILL RECOGNIZES IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S ROBBERY STATUTE WAS WRITTEN BELIEVE IT OR NOT IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO AND IS NOT BEEN MODIFIED SINCE NOW THERE ARE MANY ADDITIONAL. CRIMES HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE BOOKS THAT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THEFT OR STOLEN ITEMS OR- BENJAMIN ARE YOU NAME IT BUT ROBBERY JUST AS A SINGULAR STATUTE HAS NOT BEEN MODIFIED. AND THE ROBBERY STATUTE THAT EXISTS ON OUR BOOKS IS IMMATERIAL TO THE VALUE OF WHAT A PERSON STOLE WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO DIFFERENTIATE IT BETWEEN THEFT IS THAT ROBBERY INVOLVES INJURY. OR USE OF WEAPONS ARE THERE ARE THESE OTHER FACTORS WHICH THEN MAKES IT A FELONY. NOW BECAUSE CURRENT LAW ARE THEFT LAW THE THEFT IS HAS A VALUE ASSOCIATED SO THINGS OF TOTAL VALUE OF NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY OR LESS. BUT WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WE'VE HAD CIRCUMSTANCES IN MANY OF THESE WE RECEIVE TESTIMONY ABOUT. WHERE. EIGHT WHAT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED A PETTY THEFT OCCURS. BUT IN THE ACT SO FOR EXAMPLE. ON A PERSON IS A SHOPLIFTER AND IS RUNNING OUT OF THE STORE. BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE CAUGHT IN THE BUMP INTO THE SECURITY GUARD THEY DON'T KNOCKED THE SECURITY GUARD OVER. THEY DON'T HURT THE SECURITY GUARD BUT THEY BUMP INTO THEM AS THEY RUN OUT. BECAUSE THERE IS NO REAL DEFINITION OF WHAT THE FORCE OR THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE SOCIALLY WITH ROBBERY. ANY PROSECUTOR WHO CHOOSES TO CAN ELEVATE THAT CHARGE TO A FELONY CHARGE. NOW. CERTAINLY ANY. THEFT THEN FALLS OR RESULTS IN AN INJURY TO A PERSON AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT UNDER THE LAW GREAT BODILY INJURY CAN INCLUDES BRUISING A BLACK TIE CAN BE DEFINED UNDER OUR STATUTE IS GREAT BODILY INJURY THAT MY BILL THE THIS ONE SB TWO WOULD NOT. ALLOW THAT TEND TO BECOME. THE FACT WHAT MY BILL DOES IS CREATE A HIGHER CATEGORY OF DAFT. ABOVE JUST THE BASELINE ONE WHICH ONLY. REQUIRES NOW UP TO SIX MONTHS IN JAIL. BUT CREATING A NEW CATEGORY OF THEFT SECOND ND YOU UP IN UP TO A YEAR OF JAIL WHERE THERE WERE SOME INADVERTENT AND HOW MANY USED TO TERMS THAT ARE ALWAYS SCARY FOR PEOPLE BUT FOR SEVERE BUT DOES NOT RESULT. IN THE TYPE OF INJURIES I DESCRIBED EVEN BRUISING. AND IS NOT AN ASSAULT OR BATTERY. BUT NONE OF THOSE THINGS CAN BE FACTORS FOR MY BILL TO APPLY. BUT RATHER FOR THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT- BLURRED NOW. AND ARE NOT APPROPRIATE TO BE CHARGED IS ROBBERY WE WANT PEOPLE. WHO COMMIT VIOLENCE WHEN THEY STEAL TO BE CHARGED WITH ROBBERY ABSOLUTELY THAT IS APPROPRIATE AND WE WANT THAT BUT WHERE WE ARE FINDING IS BECAUSE AGAIN THE LACK OF CLARITY BETWEEN THE DISTINCTION THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE BEING CHARGED WITH FELONY ROBBERY. THAT JUDGES EVEN FEEL ARE SHOULD NOT IS NOT APPROPRIATE NOW TO D. A.'S THAT TESTIFIED IN THE COMMITTEE DESCRIBED THANKS FOR EXAMPLE. D. A. O'MALLEY WHO IS PRESIDENT OF THE DA'S ASSOCIATION AT THE TIME SHE STATED THAT. CERTAIN OF THESE ROBBERIES THERE WAS A FAMOUS COURT CASE CALLED ESTES ARE OFTEN LOW LEVEL CRIMES AND THEY SHOULD HAVE LESS SEVERE SANCTIONS. THEN FELONY ROBBERY. BANDAGE THAT SHE OFTEN TRIES TO PROSECUTE THEM AS SOMETHING DIFFERENT. ADDITIONALLY D. A. ROSEN TESTIFIED THAT THE COMMITTEE SHOULD LIMIT THE PROSECUTORS ABILITY TO CHARGE SUCH ROBBERIES AS FELONY OFFENSES. BUT THE ONLY WAY THAT WE CAN GIVE THAT GUIDANCE IS BY FIXING THE STATUTE AND SO. WHAT IN DOING SO WHAT I'M TRYING TO ACHIEVE BY EIGHTY TWO IS TO CREATE A NEW CATEGORY OF THEFT AND THIS IS NOT USUAL FOR ME TO BE ADVOCATING TO CREATE A NEW CRIME. AND A CRIME WITH A HIGHER PENALTY BUT IT'S APPROPRIATE SO THAT WE DO NOT HAVE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE PEOPLE. HAVE COMMITTED SOMETHING THAT IS. AGAIN THIS THIS TYPE OF DISTINCTION THAT MAY OF THAT MANY OF US. RESULTED IN. A BUMPING INTO THE SECURITY GUARD OR- OUTSIDE YELLING AT SOMEONE FOR EXAMPLE. SO THERESHOULD BE A ABILITY TO CHARGE THEM WITH SOMETHING MORE THAN THE VERY LOWEST MISDEMEANOR BUT NOT SOMETHING AS HIGH AS ROBBERY WHICH COULD END UP GIVING YOU FIVE YEARS IN PRISON SO THAT'S THE DISTINCTION I'M TRYING TO CREATE- AND WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO TURN TO MY WITNESS IN SUPPORT WHO IS AGAIN. OUR- JUDGE PETER ESPINOZA WHO AS I INDICATED WAS ORIGINALLY APPOINTED TO THE SUPERIOR COURT BY GOVERNOR PETE WILSON SERVED TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND WAS A MEMBER HI IS A MEMBER OF THE PENAL CODE REVIEWS REVISION COMMITTEE. SURCHARGES PANOS. THANK YOU SENATOR AND- AGAIN TRUCK. MANY OF THE COMMENTS OF A WILL ALL REMAIN. EXPLANATION OF THIS BILL. BUT. IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT- IF SERIOUS INJURY OR USE OF A WEAPON IS ALLEGED THE APPROPRIATE CHARGES STILL ROBBERY- AND OTHER CHARGES THAT CAN BE FILED LIKE A SONG. THE DESIGNATION OF ALL OPERATIONS SERIOUS AND VIOLENT CRIMES IS SOMEWHAT MISLEADING AND AS SENATOR SKINNER'S ALREADY INDICATED WE ARE RELYING ON A STATUE THAT WAS CREATED IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO WITHOUT. ANY OR MUCH- UPDATING THE DEFINITION IS EXTREMELY BROAD AND ANY AMOUNT OF FOR WILL SUPPLY. ALL ROBBERY OR VIOLENT OFFENSES UNDER THE THREE STRIKES LAW BUT NOT ALL ROBBERIES ARE ACTUALLY VIOLENT IN THE- SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS BILL- THE LEMONADE THE POSSIBILITY THAT IF YOU ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU ARE CHARGED. WITH RESISTING- THE ARREST OF DURING THE PARIS STUFF YOU YOU WILL NOT LIKELY CHARGE WITH STRIKER. I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF DROPS THE- AGAIN THROUGH OUR RACIAL EQUITY LANDS 86% OF PEOPLE IN C. TWO C. R. FOR ROBBERY. MORE PEOPLE OF COLOR THE RULE OVER EIGHT THOUSAND UNARMED COMMERCIAL OPERATION CALIFORNIANS TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN. AND EXPERIENCE TELLS US THAT MANY. YES THIS ROBBERIES. INVOLVE PEOPLE WHO ARE. PRINT FROM SOME UNMET PEER BILL NAY. ON THE- BECAME THE CA BECAME COME THAT SUCH. ARE TOO LIBERALLY AND FREQUENTLY USE. TO RAISE WARMER ADMITTED PETTY CASH TO FELONY STRIKE OFFENSE ALL THE CONSEQUENCES. THAT ENSUE- MANY THE CASES THAT I. OBSERVED IN MY TWENTY FIVE YEARS WHERE PETTY THEFTS WERE ELEVATED TO FIRST DEGREE ROBBERY. STRIKE OFFENSES- INVOLVED PEOPLE WHO WERE SUFFERING FROM AN THAT THE A GROUP HEALTH NEEDS SUCH AS- IN RECENT ILLNESS OR NON MEN UNTREATED SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER WHICH CLEARLY AFFECTS THEIR DECISION MAKING ABILITY- WHEN IT AND- THEY ARE THEY ARE RESPONSE TO BEING CONFRONTED DURING A PETTY THEFT AFTER. THE TYPICAL ESTAS ROBERT HE HAS DESCRIBED BY SENATOR SKINNER IS WHEN A PERSON ENTERS THE STORE GRAB SOME SORT OF MERCHANDISE AND ONE. CONFRONTED BY STORE SECURITY ARE OUR EMPLOYEES AT THE STORE USING SOME LEVEL OF THREAT OR- SOME OF THEM OF COURSE TRY TO ESCAPE. SOMETIMES A IS CAN BE A SIMPLE. PUSHING AND SHE TO ESCAPE GRASP. OF SOME OF THE TO THEM- AND IT YOU KNOW- THERE ARE SOME SICK PORTION OF THE POP. BOTH IN THE COUNTY JAIL IN THE STATE PRISON SYSTEM COURT PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM ON THAT. HEALTH MAKES. FUND UNTREATED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS IN EGYPT FOR EXAMPLE THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY JAIL WHICH IS A MAJOR TRIBUTARY TO THE CDC ARE HAS SIX THOUSAND- PERSONS WHO ARE IN SOME FORM OF MENTAL HEALTH HOUSING RIGHT NOW SO. THIS IS AN ISSUE- THAT THE COMMISSION TOOK VERY SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED- THE GREAT PLAINS YOU HEARD FROM THE DH. WE THAT WE RECEIVED TESTIMONY FROM WE ALSO RECEIVED TESTIMONY FROM STEVE WAGSTAFFE FROM- SANTA CLARA OR SAN MATEO COUNTY- AND- I THINK THE SENATORS BILLS IS A.

I HAVE NO FOR COMMENTS THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU. WE'RE GONNA BRING ABOUT TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTION OR CONCERNS BY THE COMMITTEE SENATOR WIENER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THOMAS CHAIRMAN I KNOW. I'VE BEEN HEARING A LOT OF THIS BOB WE HEARD BUT HERE IN THE- OF SOME OF THE HORRIFIC AT. PARTICULARLY ON OUR API TO. RECENTLY WHICH WE'VE BEEN SAYING. IT ALL OVER WITH THE UP. AND UP TO CAN HE CRY. AGAINST A P. I. P. FUELED BY A LAW OF WHAT'S OVER OF THE- RACIST. MADE OVER THE LAST YEAR- IN IN MY COMMUNITY IN SAN FRANCISCO. WE'VE GOT A TAX ON SENIORS AND IT'S CAN AND THE PHILIPPINE CAN. AND THE COMMUNITY- AND IS. VERY AN AWFUL AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE. THAT OUR COMMUNITY WORKING HAND IN GLOVE. WITH OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IS APPREHENDING- THESE PERPETRATORS AND THAT THEY ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. FOR THEIR HORRIFIC ACTIONS WE'VE ALSO SEEN- STORES TARGETED IT'S REALLY IT IS. IT IS TO. THE PROBLEM IS REAL- AND FOR. FIVE SEEN ON ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF IN OUR AND- ABOUT THIS BILL. THIS BILL DOES NOT IF YOU SAW SOMEONE. THAT IS A DIFFERENT CROSS. NINE RAW FOR PETTY. IF GO UP TO US. AND SHALL THAT SENIOR TO THE- YOU A AGAINST SENIOR IF YOU'RE INTO THAT SCENE- YOU CAN BE CHARGED WITH A- IF GOD FORBID THAT SCENE TYRESE OR WHETHER OR NOT THE PER SENIOR DOT. THAT IT IS MURDER OR- OR SOME OF CRIME AND NOTHING IN BILL CHANGES. I'D PUT SOME INSTANCE ALSO FACEP. IT SAYS IF SB EIGHT TWO IS ASSAULTS LOS WRONG WITHOUT A- ONE BE A FELON ANYMORE. BUT THAT'S THE BEST FALLS. COMMIT ROBBERY WITH VIOLENCE IT IS STILL A FELONY ROBBERY IN ADDITION TO AN ASSAULT. ANYONE IF YOU ASSAULTED THE PERSON. AND SO YOU KNOW THIS THIS COMES OUT OF THE PENAL REVIEW COMMISSION I WANT TO THANK CENTER SKINNER FOR DOING ENORMOUS WORK ON THAT COMMITTEE FOR YEARS THAT IS A COMMITTEE THAT WAS MADE UP OF A BROAD CROSS SECTION. OF THE COMMUNITY INCLUDING JUDGES INCLUDING DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND PRIVATE CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEYS AND LEGISLATORS AND OTHERS AND THE GOAL IS TO SAY YOUR WE HAVE PROVISIONS IN OUR PENAL CODE THAT HAVE BEEN THERE FOR SOMETIMES A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS OR A HUNDRED THIRTY. YEARS AND I'VE NEVER BEEN TOUCHED AND HOW ARE THEY BEING APPLIED TODAY AND IS THAT APPROPRIATE- AND WE SEE THAT BY TIMES SOME DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ARE OVERCHARGING- YOU KNOW WHAT WHEN AND TURNING WHAT IS NOT A SITUATION WHERE YOU'RE GOING AND GOING AND INJURING SOMEONE AND COMMITTING A TERRIBLE CRIME AGAINST SOMEONE. AND TURNING IT FROM A MISDEMEANOR INTO A FELONY- SUIT YOU KNOW THIS AND WE ALSO HAVE TO BE CLEARING THIS COMES UP A LOT IT COMES UP IN OTHER CONTEXTS. MISDEMEANORS A REAL CRIME. MR YOU CAN GO TO COUNTY JAIL FOR A YEAR FOR A MISDEMEANOR I WOULDN'T WANT TO GO TO COUNTY JAIL FOR A YEAR. THAT'S A SERIOUS PUNISHMENT- AND IF YOU COMMIT. A CRIME WHERE YOU'RE REALLY ENTERING SOMEONE WE'RE ASSAULTING THEM YOU CAN GO TO STATE PRISON STILL. EVEN WITH SB EIGHTY TWO. SO I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO FOCUS ON WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND WHAT IT DOESN'T DO- AND I UNDERSTAND PEOPLE ARE. REALLY ANGRY AND SCARED ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE COMMUNITY I SHARE THAT ANGER. TURNS MY STOMACH WHEN I SEE WHAT PEOPLE ARE CAPABLE OF DOING TO OTHER PEOPLE- PARTICULARLY TO SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE SENIORS IT IS DESPICABLE. AND IT NEEDS TO BE THE PEOPLE NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL. IS ABOUT- AND SO I SUPPORT THIS BILL- I DON'T MOVE IT. AND I HOPE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE AS CONCERNED AS WE ALL ARE ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING THE COMMUNITY. CAN FOCUS ON THE FACTS HERE. AND REALLY FOCUS ON HAVING ACCURATE FACTS ABOUT THIS LEGISLATION AND ANY LEGISLATION. I KNOW LIKE MY COLLEAGUES I NEVER HAVE A PROBLEM FOR BEING CRITICIZED. FOR WHAT I DO AND I'M SURE CENTER SKINNER IS OF THE SAME MIND BUT I BUT IT'S BUT IT'S NOT RIGHT. TO CRITICIZE SOMEONE FOR WHAT THEY DIDN'T DO- AND THAT IS HAPPENING HERE WITH US YOU TO SOME OF THE BILL. THANK YOU ANY DISAGREEMENTS BY COLLEAGUES HERE. IN NINETEEN NINE I JUST ALSO JUST WANNA RECALLED BACK WHICH A SENATOR WINNER JUST STATED- THIS BILL DOES NOT MINIMIZE CRIME IN ANY SHAPE FORM OR FASHION AND IN FACT IT ENHANCES THE TIME THAT ONE WOULD DO FROM SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR FOR A MISDEMEANOR THEFT. AND I THINK THAT SIGNIFICANT BUT AGAIN IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING AND HAS BEEN DESCRIBED BY THE OPPOSITION TO MAKE ARE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WHETHER IT'S OUR API COMMUNITY ANYONE ANYMORE VULNERABLE AND LESS LIKELY FOR THE OTHER INDIVIDUAL WHO MIGHT ASSAULT SOMEONE TO BE CHARGED FOR THAT CRIME WHAT THIS DOES IS JUST. PREVENT THERE ARE UNNECESSARY. CHARGES FOR PEOPLE WHO ABUSE MINOR. FORCE IN THE COMMISSION OF THAT CRIME AND THAT'S WHAT AND THE SAYS SENATORS TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE VERSUS- AGAIN OVER SENTENCING PEOPLE- IN MANY WAYS SO ON THAT NOTE- CENTERS CAN OR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. HANK YOU MISTER CHAIR APPRECIATE THE- DISCUSSION SO FAR BY THE COMMITTEE. NO THE MY COLLEAGUE FOR SEARCHES GO REYES SUCH THINGS AS ASSAULT. I WILL ADDITIONALLY ADD BATTERY FOR EXAMPLE THIS BILL DOES NOT ELIMINATE BATTERY AND YOU CAN BE CHARGED WITH EITHER THEFT OR ROBBERY AND BATTERY YOU CAN BE CHARGED WITH A HATE CRIME ALONG WITH STAFF TO FOR EXAMPLE YOU COULD BE CHARGED WITH ELDER ABUSE YOU COULD BE CHARGED. THE THING THAT WHAT HAPPENED SO OFTEN IS WE CONFLATE THE CHANGE OF WORK IN ONE STATUTE AS AFFECTING ALL OTHER FACTORS WHEN THIS DOES NOT AFFECT ALL OTHER FACTORS NOW I USE THE EXAMPLE OF A BLACK GUY VERY SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE THERE IS LITERALLY A NUMBER OF. COURT CASES AND PRECEDENTS WHERE BLACK I WAS DEFINED AS GREAT BODILY INJURY. AND IF THERE IS ANY TYPE OF GREAT BODILY INJURY THEN SB EIGHTY TWO DOES NOT APPLY AT ALL TO EVEN BRUISING. IS UNDER. THE PENAL CODE AND YOU CAN LOOK IT UP UNDER THE DEFINITION OF PENAL CODE INCLUDES FOR EXAMPLE PROVING BRUISING. SO AS ARE A COLLEAGUE FROM SEARCHES GROUP DESCRIBED. THERE'S BEEN A HORRIFIC INCREASE OF CRIMES AGAINST- OUR API COMMUNITY BEYOND THERE IS FEAR NOW THAT ANY TYPE OF CHANGES IN OUR PENAL CODE MIGHT MOTIVATE UCH CRIMINALS TO CONTINUE TO PREY ON OUR API COMMUNITY WITH APPS I AM ABSOLUTELY. OPPOSED TO ANYTHING THAT WOULD INCREASE THOSE CRIMES AGAINST OUR API COMMUNITY AND I WANT SUCH CRIMES TO BE FULLY FULLY ENFORCED AND TO IF THEY HAVE A HATE. PRIME COMPONENT TO THEM TO HAVE THE ADDITION OF THE HATE CRIME ADDED. AND IF THERE'S ANY TYPE OF SERIOUS INJURY FOR- FOR EXAMPLE SOME FOLKS NOT NECESSARILY THOSE WHO CALLED IN BUT YOU SEE I THINK SOMEONE WHO DID CALL INDEED YOU SUS EXAMPLE. IF A PERSON SHOP SOMEONE AN ELDERLY PERSON FOR EXAMPLE OFF THE BENCH THEY HAVE NOT COMMITTED THE THEFT YET THEY'VE SHOPPED PERSON VIOLENTLY OFF THE BENCH. THEN THE COMMIT THE THEFT THERE ARE TWO CRIMES THERE THERE'S NOT JUST THE THEFT THERE IS THE EITHER BATTERY OR ASSAULT OF THE SHOVING THEM OFF THE BENCH. SO  WANTED TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT EIGHTY TWO IS NOT TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT TYPE OF CIRCUMSTANCE OR CREATE ANY TYPE OF LESSER CHARGE FOR THAT CIRCUMSTANCE- NOW IT IS ENTIRELY THE CASE THAT THERE MAY BE A NEED AS WE GO THROUGH THE PROCESS TO CLARIFY SOME DEFINITIONS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IT IS CREATED SOME CONFUSION BUT I THINK THAT UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF THOSE AND ARE PROSECUTED PROSECUTOR COMMUNITY HAVE USED THIS BECAUSE THEY OPPOSE THIS BILL. THEY HAVE INFLAMED SOME LEGITIMATE FEARS ON PEOPLE'S PARTS NONE OF US WANT TO BE A VICTIM OF CRIME I DON'T CARE WHAT THE CRIME IS I DON'T CARE WHAT ANY LEVEL I DO NOT NOR DOES ANYONE ELSE WANT TO BE A VICTIM OF CRIME. NOR DO I EVER FEEL GOOD ABOUT ANY TYPE OF CRIME DOESN'T EVEN MATTER IF THERE IS STILL APPROPRIATE. SENTENCES FOR APPROPRIATE CRIMES AND THAT IS WHAT I AM TRYING TO DO IN SB EIGHTY TWO AND I DON'T THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE TO PREY UPON PEOPLE'S LEGITIMATE EMOTIONS ABOUT CRIME IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE WHICH I THINK HAS BEEN DONE- I DID TAKE A NIGHT APOLOGIES CHAIR THAT I DID NOT OPEN THAT I AM TAKING AN AMENDMENT THAT EXCLUDES ORGANIZED RETAIL CRIME THAT WASN'T BRACED SO MUCH IN THIS CALL BUT ONE OF THE CONCERNS FOR EXAMPLE IS THAT WE HAVE HAD AND WE DO HAVE NOW A SITUATION WHERE. PEOPLE DELIBERATELY STEAL FROM SAY THE SAME STORE AGAIN REPEATEDLY AND KEEP THEIR STEALING UNDER A CERTAIN DOLLAR AMOUNT. ON AND JUST TO AVOID HIGHER CHARGES. AND WE HAVE NOW A NEW STATUTE. COVERING ORGANIZED RETAIL. THEFT OR ORGANIZED RETAIL CRIME AND SO I AM MAKING SURE THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT TOUCH OR INTERFERE WITH THAT STATUTE AND SO I'VE TAKEN THAT AMENDMENT. AND WITH THAT I WOULD HOPE THAT THE COMMITTEE APPRECIATES THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT DO THE THINGS THAT WERE ASSERTED AND I HOPE THAT I. CAN GET TO RIDE VOTE. THANK YOU ARE WE HAVE A MOTION FIVE CENTER WIENER AND IT'S A TO PASS AS POLLS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. AT TO OUR RECOMMENDATION. CAN OUR CONSULTING CALL THE ROLL ON S. B. EIGHTY TWO SB EIGHTY TO DO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS BRADFORD PARK ROAD FOR DIET CHAU BOTH RESPECTFUL NOW. BUT CHAO ABOVE NO COM LAGER. KAMLAGER AYE SKINNER. BY IN OUR AYE WIENER AYE WIENER AYE AFFORDABLE AND- SURE. SKINNER THAT'S OUT FOR THE ONE. NOW WE'RE MOVING ON TO SENATOR BATES THANK YOU FOR WAITING SO PATIENTLY CENTER VERY SINISTER. DO A LITTLE HOUSE CLEANING KEEP IN WILL HAVE YOU READY. S. SURVEYS WILL BE PRESENTING S. B. TWO FORTY EIGHT. AM I ON THE ON THE RADAR I THANK YOU FROM MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SB TWO FORTY EIGHT A CENTRALLY- IT WOULD EXTEND THE PRESUMPTION OF OPENNESS THAT EXISTS IN ALMOST ALL CALIFORNIA COURT ROOMS TO PROCEEDINGS UNDER THE SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR ACT. RECENTLY TRIAL COURT JUDGES CONSIDERING THE POTENTIAL RELEASE OF SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATORS INTO OUR COMMUNITIES ARE ORDERING THAT THOSE PROCEEDINGS BE CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC HOWEVER UNDER THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE PRESENT AND HAVE ACCESS TO COURT PROCEEDINGS. IN SAN DIEGO MARY TAYLOR AND CYNTHIA MEDINA WHO ARE BOTH VICTIMS OF SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATORS WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO ATTEND THE DEFENDANT'S COURT PROCEEDINGS AND HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD AS A RESULT THEY TOOK PART IN MULTIPLE PROTESTS OUTSIDE OF THE SAN DIEGO COURTHOUSE AND EVENTUALLY FORMED THE GROUP YOUR VOICE HAS POWER. SB TWO FORTY EIGHT RESPONDING TO THESE PUBLIC CONCERNS WOULD REQUIRE THAT PROCEEDINGS FOR CIVIL COMMITMENT OF SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR AND SUBSEQUENT HEARINGS REGARDING HIS OR HER POTENTIAL RELIEF BE IN OPEN COURT AND ON THE RECORD UNLESS COMPELLING IN EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES JUSTIFY CLOSING THE COURTROOM TO THE PUBLIC. SB TWO FORTY EIGHT CLOSES A LOOPHOLE THAT ENSURES SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATORS SHOULD RETURN TO THE STATE HOSPITAL TO CONTINUE. THE S. V. P. ORIGINAL COMMITMENT TO CAPTURE NEW PRISON SENTENCE HAS BEEN COMPLETED AND I DO UNDERSTAND THAT THE COMMITTEE YOUR ODD CHAIRMAN'S- RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS DEAL WITHOUT ARE ONLY AND I CERTAINLY ACCEPT OF THOSE AMENDMENTS AND THANK.

FORTY EIGHT WILL FOREVER CHANGE THE COURT THE BILITY TO PROTECT THE PSYCHOTHERAPIST PATIENT PRIVILEGE AND- FURTHER UNDERMINE THE REHABILITATED AFTER DESTRUCTIVE ENERGY. MY NAME IS AMY HOFFMAN AND I AM THE SUPERVISING ATTORNEY AT THE SAN DIEGO PUBLIC DEFENDER SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR UNIT I'VE HANDLED MULTIPLE CONDITIONAL RELEASE HEARINGS THAT FOCUS ON EVIDENCE AND TESTIMONY OF SEX OFFENDER TREATMENT. ADDITIONALLY HEARINGS OCCUR AFTER LENGTHY CRIMINAL SENTENCES AND AFTER YEARS IF NOT DECADES OF TREATMENT AT COALINGA STATE HOSPITAL. MANY WONDER GO TREATMENT GO THROUGH AN INTENSIVE MORE THAI INPATIENT PROGRAM STRUCTURED ON EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES. NO WHERE IS THERE A GREATER NEED FOR THE COURTS TO PROTECT THE PSYCHOTHERAPIST PATIENT PRIVILEGE. WITHOUT IT PATIENTS WILL BE RELUCTANT IN MAKING FULL DISCLOSURES UPON WHICH DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT THE PAN. YOU MAY NOT ONLY FOCUSES ON THE OFFENSES THEY COMMITTED BUT ALSO REQUIRED TO KEEP LOOK AT THEIR OWN VICTIMIZATION TRAUMA. A MAGIC HAVING EVERY CONVERSATION WITH YOUR THERAPIST REVEALED FROM THE WITNESS STAND FOR ALL TO HEAR. THE CONSTITUTIONALLY GENOCEA SB T. LIVE PRESS ON THE NON PUNITIVE NATURE OF THE PATIENT. CONFINEMENT SIMILAR TO CONSERVATORSHIP PROCEEDINGS THE COURT CURRENTLY HAS THE DISCRETION TO CLOSE PORTIONS OF S. ET RELIEF HEARING. SB TWO FORTY EIGHT WITH A RADICALLY THE COURT'S ABILITY TO DETERMINE WHETHER MENTAL HEALTH AND MEDICAL EVIDENCE. SHE TO CONTINUE TO RECEIVE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS FOR THAT HE KEEP PATIENT. THESE PROCEEDINGS PRESENT CHALLENGES IN THE COURT IS NOT A MORE VICTIMS RIGHT TO MAKING THESE DECISIONS. CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM HAS AROUND THE CLOCK SUPERVISION INCLUDING TWENTY FOUR HOUR GPS THAT YOU CASTING AND POLYGRAPH EXAMINATION. WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS FEAR AND APPREHENSION WHEN CONSIDERING. RELEASED A SEXUALLY VIOLENT OFFENDER. HIGHER TO PLACEMENT IN THE GUINNESS RELEASE. THE VICTIMS AND PUBLIC ARE NOTIFIED AND INVITED TO ATTEND THE PUBLIC HEARING. AS THE COURT REGARDING THEIR CONCERNS. SB TWO FORTY EIGHT DOES NOTHING TO INCREASE PUBLIC SAFETY PROSECUTORS ALREADY HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACCESS THE INDIVIDUAL RECORD. NO PUBLIC GOOD IS SERVED BY FURTHER OPENING ACCESS TO THOSE RECORDS. THE MORE THE LEGISLATURE CHIPPED AWAY AT THE PRIVACY RIGHTS OF EACH AND THE GREATER THE CHALLENGE WHERE JUSTICE SYSTEM IN DELIVERING EFFECTIVE TREATMENT ASSEMBLY COMMUNICATION.

THANK YOU TO ALL OUR SUPPORT IN A POSITION WITNESSES WILL NOT BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO OUR MEMBERS DO ANY OF OUR MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. WHAT. I GUESS I'LL ASK A QUESTION WELL WERE YES MEMBERS OF. SO I JUST WANTED TO CONFIRM SENATOR- THAT THE AMENDMENTS WERE TAKEN REGARDING JURY TRIAL. NO THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN NOW I HAVE TO DO WITH THE LOOPHOLE THAT IT ALLOWS SEXUALLY FAILING HAVE TO RETURN THAT AFTER THEY COMMIT ANOTHER FELONY- THEY CAN RE LITIGATE THEIR COMMITMENT TO THE STATE HOSPITAL SEEMS THAT SUMMER TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A LOOPHOLE THAT'S CURRENTLY IN THE LAW. SO THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS SOUGHT THANKS TO THE CHAIR I ACTUALLY A POLL THAT PART OF THE BILL REGARDING THE CLOSING OF THE LOOPHOLE IT'S A CHANGE AND WHETHER THE OPEN PROCEEDINGS PART. OF THE BILL ON HIS SUPPORTABLE. FIVE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE MOMENT DELETE SECTION ONE OF THE BILL SO THAT'S THE OPEN PROCEEDINGS PART AND KEEPS THE OTHER SECTION YEAH. CORRECT. WE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS BY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. NINETY NINE SURVEY TO TALK TO CLOSE OUT YOUR FILE JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR STAFF AND CERTAINLY OUR CHAIR FOR WORKING ON MINE TO POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS SO WE DIDN'T GET THERE ON THIS ROUND BUT I DO APPRECIATE THAT YOU TOOK THE TIME AND I'D LIKE TO SAY ON BEHALF OF BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE IT IS A DIFFICULT ONE. I AM VERY VERY SUPPORTIVE AS YOU ALL KNOW OF THE REHABILITATION OF FOR FOLKS THAT HAVE SPENT TIME INCARCERATED VARIETY OF REASONS IN A PARTICULAR THIS ISSUE AREA- THAT PEOPLE HAVE PROBLEMS AND HIS IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT ONE I PERSONALLY HAVE BEEN A VICTIM OF SOMETHING QUITE SIMILAR TO THIS AS A CHILD AND I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT. THE MEMORIES OF THAT LAST A LIFETIME AND SO- THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THERE'S CLOSURE FOR THE VICTIMS AND PERHAPS WE NEED TO DO A LITTLE MORE WORK ON HOW WE MIGHT ACHIEVE THAT BUT AT THE SAME TIME ALFA BROUGHT UP AND THOSE WHO OPPOSE THE BILL THAT WE DO HAVE TO PROTECT TO THE ASSAILANT WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT. THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR REHABILITATION AND ONLY THE OXFORDS CAN DECIDE I BELIEVE ON WHETHER THAT ACTUALLY OCCURS AT THE TIME THEY'VE SPENT THEIR THEIR TIME IN A STATE HOSPITAL. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE WHAT THE STATISTICS ARE BUT WE DO HAVE THAT WHAT IS IT THE 8% EVERY RECIDIVISM NO MATTER WHAT IS DONE THIS WAS A COUPLE YEARS AGO ONLY STILL HAVE STATISTICS THAT WE NEED TO BE LOOKING OUT TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE TREATMENT CHEN IN THE APPROACH TO SOMETHING AS SERIOUS AS THEIR FATHER ARE ACTUALLY WE'RE GETTING GOOD RESULTS BUT IN THE MEANTIME. IT IS IMPORTANT AS I SAID TO RECOGNIZE BOTH THE VICTIMS AND CERTAINLY AT THE PREDATORS AND HOPE THAT WE CANNOT CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR SO THAT ARE VICTIMS WHO SPOKEN FROM THE HEART OF OUR OUR OUR RECOGNIZE ALSO AND I THINK THERE'S A PATH THERE THAT WILL TAKE THIS ONE HUNDRED I WOULD DONE AGAIN. EXCEPT THE CHAIRS. AMENDMENTS AND ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THE GREAT THANK YOU. WE HAVE HIGH RECOMMEND. I AM SEEKING A STATE. DELETION OF SECTION ONE OF THE BILL PRESERVES DISCRETION OF THE JUDGE TO CLOSE PORTIONS OF THE PROCEEDINGS UNDER EXISTING CONSTITUTIONAL LEGAL STANDARDS HEY. FINISH THE AVERAGE FOR TOTAL ON WITH. I WAS JUST GONNA IT THAT. DID YOU A QUESTION I WAS JUST TO STATE THAT BY FEEL TOOK THE AND THEN- THAT WAS REALLY A I DO THE PROBLEM. PART OF THE BILL AND ON THESE THE BILL AND THAT'S AMENDED- OKAY. SO WE HAVE TO- TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROACH. DO WE HAVE A MOTION. AND WE HAVE A MOTION BY- CHOI BO. IT MEASURES OUT FIVE ZERO CONGRATULATIONS AND THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK. NEXT UP SENATOR MEANT. SB. TWO SIX FOUR. BUT SENATOR WHEN YOU'RE READY THIRTY THREE PRESS SIX FOR THANK YOU MEMBERS AND THANK YOU THE COMMITTEE STAFF WHO'S BEEN WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL. SB TWO SIXTY FOUR WHICH WOULD PROHIBIT THE SALE OF FIREARMS AMMUNITIONS AND FIREARMS PRECURSOR PARTS. ON ALL STATE AND COUNTY PROPERTIES- ARE SPECIFICALLY IT TO SIXTY FOUR PROHIBITS. STATE OFFICERS EMPLOYEES OR OPERATORS LET'S SEIZE OR LICENSEES OF ANY STATE OWNED OR COUNTY OWNED PROPERTY. CONTRACTING FOR AUTHORIZING OR ALLOWING THE SALE OF ANY FIREARMS AMMUNITION OR FIREARM PRECURSOR PARK ON PROPERTY OWNED OR OPERATED BY THE STATE AND COUNTIES. THIS WOULD EXEMPT LAW ENFORCEMENT GUN BUY BACK PROGRAMS WHOSE PURPOSE IS TO REMOVE GUNS FROM THE COMMUNITY. NOW THE ORIGIN OF THIS BILL WAS THE WEEKEND THAT WE HAD THE EL PASO SHOOTINGS FOLLOWED BY THE DAYTON SHOOTINGS. I HAVE THREE YOUNG CHILDREN WE ACTUALLY HAVE RELATIVES IN DAYTON PRETENDING UNIVERSALLY DAYTON. AND MEMBER HAVING TO EXPLAIN TO THEM. ABOUT THE SPECTER OF GUN VIOLENCE AND GUN MASSACRES IN THIS COUNTRY. WE HAD TO MAKE THE PHONE CALLS THAT SUNDAY MORNING TO CHECK IN WITH RELATIVES. THANKFULLY ALL THE PEOPLE THAT WE KNEW WERE SAFE REPORTS MANY OTHERS WERE NOT. LATER THAT MORNING WE WENT TO OUR COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS TO RUN AND I FORGET FOR THE FIVE K. OR TEN K. I'M REMEMBERING IT IS A TEN K. BUT THAT PROBABLY MEANS IS A FIVE K. I HAD THE TWO OLDER CHILDREN WITH ME MY WIFE. AND OUR YOUNGEST WITH HER. AND AS WE FINISHED UP I REMEMBER JUST BEING BOMBARDED WITH PEOPLE GIVING US FLYERS FOR THE FREE GUN SHOW AT NEXT WEEK'S- NOT NEXT WEEKEND. I'VE SEEN THE FLYERS PLASTERED ALL AROUND. AND WONDERING WHY AT THE COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS OF ALL PLACES MY CHILDREN WERE BEING ASKED WHETHER THEY WANTED TO ATTEND A CONCERT THE NEXT WEEKEND. WHEN I WAS GROWING UP THE COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS WERE KNOWN FOR FAMILY FRIENDLY EVENTS. IN ADDITION TO THE COUNTY FAIR EACH YEAR THAT HAVE RODEOS FOUR H. EVENTS CONCERT THE CIRCUS. AND OTHER BANDS LIKE THAT. TODAY THEY'RE PRIMARILY KNOWN FOR GUN SHOWS. THE AVERAGE COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS FOR A STATE HOUSE FIVE GUN SHOWS A YEAR. FOR THE COMMITTEE STAFF IS DESCRIBED GUN SHOWS ARE SENSUALLY FORTY MARKET FOR FIREARMS THEIR PRIMARY MECHANISM BY WHICH UNLICENSED UNREGISTERED AND ILLEGAL FIREARMS OR TRAFFIC THROUGH SECONDARY MARKETS. ACCORDING TO GIFFORDS GUN SHOWS CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CIRCUMVENT GUN SAFETY LAWS ARE COMMON VENUE FOR STRAW PURCHASES AND LEGAL GUN TRANSFERS. AN ATF ALCOHOL BUREAU OF ALCOHOL TOBACCO AND FIREARM REPORT DESCRIBED GUN SHOWS AS A MAJOR TRAFFICKING CHANNEL AND FOUND THE GUN SHOWS WERE THE SECOND LARGEST SOURCE OF ILLEGALLY TRAFFICKED FIREARMS UNITED STATES. EVEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHICH HAS THE MOST STRINGENT REGULATIONS ON GUN SHOWS IN THE COUNTRY A HIGH NUMBER OF SALES OF UNLICENSED AND UNREGISTERED GUNS ORIGINATE AT GUN SHOWS. ONE OF MY WITNESSES STEVE LANGLEY THE FORMER HEAD OF THE BUREAU OF ALCOHOL TOBACCO AND FIREARMS. UNFORTUNATELY HAD TO LEAVE BECAUSE IT A HARD STOP BEFORE THIRTY PM BUT WAS GOING TO DESCRIBE HIS PERSONAL EXPERIENCES IN OBSERVING THESE TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS. TENSIONS ARE PRIMARY CONDUIT THROUGH GHOSTS WHICH GOES GUN KITS ARE SOLD. OUT IF YOU DON'T KNOW GOES GOING KIDS ARE PARTIALLY MANUFACTURED GUN PARTS THAT COME WITH INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO BE FULLY ASSEMBLED. BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY FIREARMS THEMSELVES THEY'RE NOT SUBJECT TO FIREARMS REGULATION SUCH AS BACKGROUND CHECKS AND WAITING PERIODS. THOSE GUYS HAVE BECOME A TOP CONCERN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE THEIR UNREGISTERED AND UNLICENSED AND UNTRACEABLE. BATF RECENTLY FOUND THE 30% OF GUNS RECOVERED AT CRIME SCENES HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE GOES GUNS. BUT I WILL SAY THAT EVEN IF THERE WERE ZERO SALES OF ILLEGAL UNLICENSED OR UNREGISTERED GUNS AT GUN SHOWS WHICH IS NOT THE CASE. CONCHO STILL MAKES OUR COMMUNITIES LESS SAFE LESS SAFE. LET'S BE CLEAR THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF GUN SHOWS IS TO SELL GUNS. TO PUT MORE GUNS IN TO OUR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES. AND AS THE EVIDENCE MAKES CLEAR MORE GUNS MEANS MORE GUN VIOLENCE. COUNTRIES THAT HAVE MORE GUNS HAVE MORE GUN HOMICIDES MORE GUN DEATHS MORE GUN INJURIES IT'S THE SAME STORY FOR STATES THAT HAVE MORE GUNS. MORE GUNS ALSO LEAD TO MORE CRIMES AS NUMEROUS INCORRECTLY- INTERCOURSE. STUDIES HAVE FOUND. WHAT WE'RE FACING RIGHT NOW IN THIS COUNTRY IN THE STATE IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. LONG AFTER KOBE NINETEEN TWO SIDES WILL STILL BE FACING AN EPIDEMIC OF GUN VIOLENCE IN THIS COUNTRY. AND THE LARGELY OVERLOOKED IN THE NEWS THIS YEAR WAS A SOBERING STATISTIC. FORTY THREE THOUSAND AMERICANS DIED DUE TO GUN VIOLENCE LAST YEAR DURING THE PANDEMIC. THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF GUN DEATHS IN MANY YEARS. WE MUST STAND UP AND SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. EVERY LIFE THAT WE READ ABOUT IS NOT JUST A STATISTIC IS SOMEONE MEANINGFUL. TO THEIR FAMILY THEIR FRIENDS THEIR NEIGHBORS THEIR COWORKERS. AND GUN VIOLENCE. THESE ARE ALL AVOIDABLE DEATHS. BY THE SECOND AMENDMENT PROTECTS THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS BUT IT DOES NOT REQUIRE THE TAXPAYER OWN PROPERTY BE USED TO HELP WITH. THE SALE OF THOSE GUNS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. SB TWO SIXTY FOUR ONE SURE THE STATE IS NOT PROFITING FROM THE SALE OF FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION ON STATE PROPERTY. FOR FACILITATING GUN SHOWS THAT WOULD UNDERMINE CALIFORNIA'S STRONG FIREARM REGULATIONS. WITH THAT I WANT TO INTRODUCE- SO UNFORTUNATE I MENTION STEVE LINDLEY CANNOT JOIN US BECAUSE HE DID HAVE A HARD STOP HE WAS GOING TO TESTIFY. ABOUT THE STUDIES IN HIS PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS SHOWING THAT GUN SHOWS YOU'RE IN CALIFORNIA YOU DO INDEED HAVE A LOT OF STRAW SALE PURCHASES OR ATTEMPTED PURCHASES. ANOTHER SALES UNLICENSED OR UNREGISTERED GUNS ON FORTY COULD NOT JOIN US BUT HIS TESTIMONY HAS BEEN SUBMITTED FOR THE RECORD- BUT I AM HAPPY TO INTRODUCE CHARLES BLACK- BRADY ORANGE COUNTY WHOSE FAMILY WAS PERSONALLY AFFECTED BY GUN VIOLENCE. THANK YOU MISTER BLACK. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CHARLES BLACK I'M A PAST PRESIDENT AND CURRENT BOARD MEMBER OF BREAKING ORANGE COUNTY- MY REPRESENT TODAY I AM A RETIRED ATTORNEY AND CAME TO THIS ISSUE AFTER THE GUN DEATH OF MY SON. WE WISH TO THANK SENATOR CAVEMEN FOR HIS PLEDGE TO DRESS FOR. WHY THE WORLD ARE WE SUPPORTING GUN SHOWS AT STATE AND COUNTY OWNED PROPERTY WITH TAXPAYERS MONEY WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH THE GRIEF OF GUN VIOLENCE VICTIMS THANK COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR PURCHASE OF A FIREARM IS LITERALLY A GREAT DECISION AND SHOULD BE DONE IN A MORE APPROPRIATE STUDY. DONE SHOWS ARE NOISY BUT CRIMINAL WITH CARNIVAL LIKE ATMOSPHERE. THE MASS KILLING OF FIREARMS AND THE PROMOTION OF STAYING AT THESE EVENTS AT STATE OWNED PROPERTIES- FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT OFTEN TAKES PLACE. CREATES THE APPEARANCE THAT THE STATE GIVES THEM CLOSER APPROVAL OF SUCH SALES. CERTAINLY THE FREE ADMISSION OFTEN OFFERED FOR CHILDREN TO ATTEND WITH. A PARENT GIVES ONE PAUSE. PUBLISHED RESEARCH HAS BEEN AVAILABLE FOR YEARS THAT BRING A FIREARM INTO THE HOME INCREASES THE RISK OF SUICIDE HOMICIDE AND UNINTENTIONAL SHOOTINGS TO THAT HOME. AND YET HERE WE ARE WITH GUN SHOWS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT PROVIDE MASS KILLINGS OF FIREARMS AMMUNITION AND PRECURSOR I ACQUIRE ARM PARTS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. ADDITIONALLY AND NOT INTOXICATE THE SAME TAXPAYERS PICK UP THE TAB. ONLY EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL COSTS OF GUN VIOLENCE IN CALIFORNIA. THEN ENSUES. THEREFORE WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS IN THE MAST AND PROMOTIONAL FIREARMS PRECURSOR GUN PARTS AND AMMUNITION ONE STATE AND COUNTY OWNED PROPERTIES. THIS STATE SHOULD NOT BE COMPLICIT WITH SUBJECTIVITY. THANK YOU THANK YOU. WE'RE GONNA BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE HEARING- ANYONE PRESENT HERE IN FORTY TWO OLD THREE WHO WANTS TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. OF SB. TWO SIX FOUR LET'S GO TO ROOM TWENTY FORTY. AND I SEE NO WITNESSES THERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF. TO SEARCH FOR A MODERATOR CAN WE GO TO OUR PHONE LINES AND SEE IF WE HAVE CALLERS IN Q. IN SUPPORT OF SB. TWO SIX FOUR.

WOULD DEVASTATE GUN SHOWS BOTH THE NONPROFIT AND THE PROFIT. TO PARTICIPATE WHO EXERCISE THE RIGHT TO TURN THESE LAWFULLY AND PURCHASE ITEMS AT THESE EVENTS FROM CALIFORNIA. REVERSION TO THIS BILL HAVE BEEN DETERRED BY TWO PREVIOUS GOVERNORS.

THE CALIFORNIA RIVAL CRYSTALLIZATION SUBMITTED PUBLICLY RECORDS REQUEST SEEKING INFORMATION RELATED TO THE STATEMENT THE LAST TWO YEARS AND TO DATE NO RECORDS HAVE BEEN PRODUCED. MAKING SUCH INACCURATE CLAIMS TO LEGISLATORS IN AN EFFORT TO WRONGLY WRONGFULLY INFLUENCE POLICY DECISIONS IS UNETHICAL AND UNFAIR TO THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC.

THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT THANK YOU AT THIS TIME THANK YOU MODERATOR I WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS BYE COMMITTEE CENTER WINNER NOW OKAY IF A AYE AYE- JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- HI WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY ON THE CAL PALACE AND IT'S GOING SHOWS. WHERE JACKIE SPEAR WAS THE FIRST TO TRY TO BAN THEM AND MARK LANA PICKED IT UP AND THEN- HIGH ALONG WITH TILTING WE TOOK UP THE TORCH AND ULTIMATELY NEVER QUITE GOT THE BILL PASSED VETOED VARIOUS TIMES AND ALL THAT BUT WE FINALLY WERE ABLE. TO MAKE THE POINTER CAL PALACE AVE REALLY SHOULDN'T BE HAVING GUNS SHOWS AND THEY FINALLY COUNCIL THE GUN SHOWS BUT I KNOW THIS IS AN ISSUE IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE STATE AND THE REALITY IS THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE SELLING GUNS ON. STATE LANDS THIS COUNTRY. IS AWASH IN GUN THAT TO SERVER WILL AWAY FROM CRIME- NO REASON FOR THEIR- OF GUN FOR K. THAT WE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY. MORE GUNS MEANS MORE PEOPLE GET SHOT. AND WE HAVE AN ABSOLUTE- PARKS CLOSE ENOUGH PEOPLE GETTING SHOT IN THIS COUNTRY INCLUDING CHILDREN'S SCHOOL SO. I SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION- AND I MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS REQUESTED BY COMMITTEES. CENTER- CHOI BOGUE. HELLO SENATOR MAN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FORTH I HAD A QUESTION WELL A COUPLE OF POINTS OUT QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS- BOTH THE AGRICULTURAL THE COUNTY FAIRS CURRENTLY- DECIDE. WHAT TYPE OF SHOWS ARE GOING TO HAVE IN THE COUNTIES RIGHT. YES SO IT'S I'M A HUGE PERSONAL ON LOCAL CONTROL SO THAT'S IMPORTANT. AND THESE BOARDS ARE APPOINTED HOW AND BY WHOM- TYPICALLY BY THE GOVERNOR'S MY UNDERSTANDING. SO THE GOVERNOR APPOINTS THE BOARD MEMBERS FOR THE AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT IN THE COUNTY FAIRS WHO DECIDE WHICH- WHICH- WHICH SHOWS TO HAVE IN THERE. OKAY SO ON THAT LEVEL. I'M I'M HESITANT TO PASS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL BECAUSE I ALSO UNDERSTAND- AND THEN GIVEN THE CONTEXT OF WHERE I'M COMING FROM- CULTURALLY THERE'S A LOT OF- I KNOW PERSONALLY MANY MANY PEOPLE WHO- BUYING GUNS AND COLLECTING GUNS IS A CULTURAL FAMILY AFFAIR- AND IT'S THESE ARE GOOD PEOPLE WHO ARE- EMOTIONALLY HEALTHY BE HERE REALLY HEALTHY AND- IT'S A- SENATE. PASSAGE IT'S A BECAUSE THAT IS THE CULTURAL FAMILY ENDEAVOR- AND I'M- THIS IS JUST A PERSONAL OPINION- BUT IT IT IT MAKES ME A LITTLE HESITANT TO. MAKE IT APPEAR COME ACROSS AS THESE PEOPLE ARE- IN THE WRONG. ST I'M VERY RESPECTFUL ABOUT CULTURAL ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S DONE THE HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT. SO HAVING SAID THAT- DO YOU THINK THAT TE- THE AGRICULTURE IN THE COUNTY FAIRS HAVE THE ABILITY TO- MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR- OF THEIR CONSTITUENTS AS FAR AS LISTENING AND HEEDING TO WHAT THEIR CONSTITUENTS WANT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SHOW IN THEIR IN THEIR COUNTY FAIRS. I'M A QUESTION. FIVE YES- AND SO TO ANSWER YOUR FIRST POINT I ALSO APPRECIATE THE CONCEPT OF LOCAL CONTROL I THINK THERE'S ALWAYS A BALANCE OF COURSE AND I THINK YOU QUESTION FIRST OF ALL SENATOR- I THINK THERE'S A BALANCE OF COURSE BETWEEN STATEWIDE. POLICY PRIORITIES AND THIS IS ONE WHERE I THINK IT THE DATA IS CLEAR WE HAVE A GUN VIOLENCE EPIDEMIC IN THE STATE IN IN THIS COUNTRY. AND I GUESS THE ANALOGY I WOULD USE WOULD BE TO SEAT BELTS AND CAR SAFETY AND AIR BAGS BACK IN THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES- THE AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE MANDATORY SEATBELT LAWS- THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS- MUCH LIKE WHAT WE'RE DISCUSSING TODAY- YOU KNOW. PUT DOWN ON LOCAL CONTROL SO TO SPEAK BUT IT SAVES LIVES- AND THERE WAS A- OBSTINANCE AND- A REAL. PUSH BACK AGAINST THESE TYPES OF REGULATIONS- WHAT I'M PROPOSING I DON'T THINK IS TOTALLY UNREASONABLE PARTICULARLY GIVEN THAT AS I UNDERSTAND I'VE BEEN TOLD BY MY LOCAL FAIR BOARD. THAT THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO RESPOND T CONSTITUENCIES THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE SOLVING QUOTE UNQUOTE RIGHT AND I HAD TO DRESS THAT POINT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF MONEY FOR FAIRGROUND SO MY FAIRGROUND SAID THEY NEEDED THE MONEY- WE LOOKED INTO WHAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY MAKING IT WAS POINT TWO THREE PERCENT. OF THEIR ANNUAL REVENUES- BUT OF COURSE IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR OBLIGATION I THINK MANY FAIR BOARD MEMBERS TO FEEL THIS WAY. IS TO MAXIMIZE YOUR REVENUE INTAKE THEN YOU'RE GONNA TAKE WHATEVER YOU CAN NOW THE ONE OF THE CHALLENGES I HAVE IT WITH THIS REASONING FOR- DILEMMAS I HAVE WITH IT IS. YOU KNOW THEY ALSO DON'T TAKE PORN CONVENTIONS OR MARIJUANA CONVENTIONS WE ASK THEM I DON'T DO THAT BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE A LOT OF MONEY TO THEY SAY IT'S BECAUSE THOSE ARE NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO. BE A FAMILY FRIENDLY VENUE WHY I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU ALL THAT. GUN VIOLENCE IS MUCH MORE FAMILY PROBLEMATIC AND ON FAMILY FRIENDLY THEN PORN OR CANNABIS AND THAT'S. NOT THE CITY TO BE INDOORS ONE OF THOSE TWO BUT OTHER TO SAY. BECAUSE AT THE END. MECHANISMS I JUST THINK THERE'S SOME WRONG. I'LL SAY THAT MIGHT VERY OWN THIS IS TRANSCEND. SO FRANCISCO. ACROSS THIS. ARE NOT RESPONDING TO WHAT I THINK SHE IS SEE. AN OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT IN MY DISTRICT IN ORANGE COUNTY FOR. YOU KNOW GETTING GUNS OFF THE STREET AND NONE OF THIS BY THE WAY TAKES GUNS AWAY AWAY FROM GUN STORES DOESN'T IN HIM FRENCH UPON PEOPLE'S RIGHTS TO LAWFULLY PURCHASING ON A GUN. ALL IT SAYS IS THAT WE DON'T WANT TAXPAYER VENUES TO BE USED FOR THOSE PURPOSES. SO I DON'T THINK THIS REALLY INFRINGES ON PRINCIPLES- THAT YOU'RE IMPLICATING BUT BUT I UNDERSTAND THERE IS A DIFFERENCE. IN HOW WE VIEW GUNS AND I WOULD SUBMIT THAT. THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO KIND OF. THE SORT OF BRIDGE THE DIFFERENCE A LITTLE BIT IT'S NOT FORCING ANYTHING IT'S SIMPLY SAYING THAT. STATE OWNED PROPERTY SHOULD NOT BE A CONDUIT. FOR DISTRIBUTING MORE GUNS INTO COMMUNITIES. SO TO THAT I WOULD FOLLOW UP WITH ANOTHER QUESTION ASKED TO. IF THESE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE- GUN INDUSTRY IS VERY MUCH REGULATED HIGHLY REGULATED IN CALIFORNIA- THESE ARE IT LEGALLY OWNED AND LEGALLY. LEGALLY A BITING. OUT BUSINESSES FUNCTIONING IN THESE ENDEAVORS. WHAT IN YOUR BEING SENT TO YOUR ATTORNEY SAM I RESPECT I RESPECT YOUR BUT YOUR YOUR OPINION ON THIS BUT WHAT TO- WHAT GROUNDS COULD WE HAVE IS A STATE TO MANDATE NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE THESE BUSINESSES. OUT FUNCTION OR DO BUSINESS ON ON ON THE PUBLIC- PUBLIC LANDS OR PUBLIC VENUES. BECAUSE THE STATE PROPERTY I DON'T THINK THE COMMITTEES EVER RAISED AN ISSUE AND I KNOW THAT- THE HEAD OF- THE- LIAISON- MISTER GRIFFIN FROM CPC RPA REYES STATE CONSTITUTIONALITY ISSUE. I DON'T THINK THAT'S WELL FOUNDED NIGHT THAT THE C. R. P.'S LAWSUITS. AGAINST SAN DIEGO AND HAVE NOT GONE ANYWHERE BOB THIS IS EVEN MORE WELL GROUNDED BECAUSE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE DISCONNECT YOUR TALKING ABOUT. THE STATE SAYING THAT WE DON'T WANT CERTAIN ACTIVITIES DONE ON STATE PROPERTY IT'S OUR PROPERTY. AND AS MUCH AS I DO RESPECT THE SECOND AMENDMENT I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT THE TENTH AMENDMENT. GIVES THE STATE'S INCLUDING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SIGNIFICANTLY WAY TO MANAGE OUR OWN AFFAIRS NOW WE CANNOT TELL GUNNED IT STORES YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T SELL GUNS WE CAN'T WE CAN'T WE CAN'T TELL GUN OWNERS YOU CAN'T OWN GUNS THE SECOND AMENDMENT. AS INTERPRETED BY THE SUPREME COURT UNITED STATES HAS MADE THAT CLEAR. BUT NEITHER CAN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR ANYONE ELSE TELL THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHAT WE CAN OR CANNOT DO WITH OUR PROPERTY. OKAY. AND JUST SO HIS WORDS WERE CLEAR THESE ARE LEGAL ACTIVITIES- THAT ARE GOING ON WITH- AND PERSON BECAUSE I KNOW MANY OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS AND- AND INDIVIDUALS THAT ATTEND THESE EVENTS- WITH HEALTHY MIND SAID SPEAR REALLY WHILE DOING IT A CULTURAL FAMILY THING ATTENDING THESE THEY FOLLOW THE LAWS THEY DO EVERYTHING THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING IT AND AS THE GENTLEMAN THE WITNESS. STATED EARLIER THERE ARE NO GUNS THAT ARE ACTUALLY BEING TRANSMITTED OR BEING SOLD RIGHT AT THAT TIME THEY STILL HAVE TO GO TO THE TEN DAY PROCESS RIGHT ALTHOUGH IT'S HAS BEEN DESCRIBED BY NUMEROUS PEOPLE AND I'M NOT REALLY AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT MR LINDLEY WAS NOT ABLE TO TESTIFY BECAUSE HE WAS GOING TO SPEAK AT THIS POINT- BUT WHAT HE'S GOING TO DESCRIBE WAS A CIRCUS OR A CARNIVAL LIKE ATMOSPHERE AND SO THERE ARE LOTS OF GUN SALES THAT HAPPENED JUST IN THE PARKING LOT FOR A HAPPEN THROUGH VAN KNOW WHERE THE GUN IS DELIVERED LATER AND SO- WHAT HE'S GOING TO TESTIFY TO IS THAT HE HAD PERSONALLY WITNESSED. A NUMBER OF DEALERS BEING WILLING TO ENGAGE IN SO CALLED STRAW SALES WHICH IS I'M GOING UP THERE IN PURCHASING ON BEHALF OF SOMEONE ELSE IS VERY CLEAR ON PURCHASING FOR SOMEONE ELSE A NUMBER OF GUN DEALERS APPEARED WILLING TO ENGAGE IN THOSE TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS OTHER TYPES OF UNLICENSED SALES APPEAR TO BE OCCURRING AS WELL SO I WOULD TAKE DISPUTE WITH THAT- CLAIM THAT YOU KNOW FIRST OF ALL IT'S KIND OF TOUGH TO SAY THERE'S A 100% OF ANYTHING RIGHT. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS FOLLOW THE LAW- BUT JUST GIVEN THE ATMOSPHERE- IT'S BEEN I THINK WELL DOCUMENTED THAT THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF- UNSEEMLY ILLICIT PURCHASES AND SALES THE CURRENT THESE GUN SHOWS EVEN IF THAT WE REGULATE AWAY AND SO THIS IS KIND OF A HOT BED OF STUFF LIKE THAT ACCORDING TO A NUMBER OF STUDIES AND TESTIMONIES OF FOLKS LIKE MISTER LINDLEY. DO WE HAVE ANY DATA THAT. HAS A- BETWEEN- IN GUNS OR- WHATEVER YOU CAN PURCHASE- RIFLES OR SO FORTH IT. DON'T KNOW ALL THE AT. ALL THE DIFFERENT YPES OF. GUNS PER SE BUT- DO WE HAVE ANY DATA THAT STIPULATE OR CORRELATE- HOW MANY OF THOSE THAT ARE BOUGHT AT GUN SHOWS ARE ATTRIBUTED TO CRIMES. IT IS TOUGH TO TRACK THEM WHAT WHAT HAS BEEN STATED IS THAT- I THINK IT WAS LET ME SEE HERE IT WOULD MIGHT BEEN THE- FBI OR ATF HAS SAID- THAT GUN SHOWS OR THE CRITICAL MOMENT IN THE CHAIN OF CUSTODY FOR MANY GUNS THE POINT AT WHICH THEY MOVE FROM THE SOMEWHAT REGULATED LEGAL MARKET. THE SHADOW WE NO QUESTIONS ASKED THE LEGAL MARKET- LET'S SEE HERE. 80% OF FIRE ARMS AND SEIZED BY MEXICAN AUTHORITIES IN LAST FIVE YEARS HAVE COME TO THE UNITED STATES. AND IT IS BELIEVED I GET IT THIS IS A IT'S HARD TO FIND DATA BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A BY DEFINITION. SOMETHING THAT'S ILLEGAL RIGHT SO WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ORIGINATE FROM BUT THERE IS A THERE'S CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT THERE ARE. PURCHASES AND SALES OF THESE TYPES OF GUNS AND THEN THE QUESTION IS HOW MANY MOVES INTO THAT. STREAM OF ILLICIT GUNS AND- YOU KNOW JUST TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST I DON'T THINK ANYONE HAS THAT DATE I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S REALLY SOMETHING YOU'RE ABLE TO GOING TO BE ABLE TO QUALIFY- BUT IT DOES. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CONCERNED THAT THIS DOES HAPPEN. OKAY AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AND CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW BUT- DID THEY HAVE UNDER COVER- OFFICERS ON THE GROUNDS WHEN THEY'RE THEY'RE SELLING- GUNS AT THE GUN SHOWS. I'M SURE THEY DO OF UNDERCOVER OFFICERS THEY CERTAINLY OF UNIFORMED OFFICERS. AND- BUT YOU KNOW AGAIN. IT'S JUST KIND OF THE NATURE OF THE TRANSACTION RIGHT AND SO- FOR EXAMPLE AGAIN THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS PEOPLE THAT HAVE GONE TO GUN SHOWS AND IT TRIED TO ENGAGE IN ILLEGAL. TRANSACTIONS AND THEY HAD DOCUMENTED THAT IN FACT THERE WERE SAILORS DEALERS WILLING TO ENGAGE IN THESE THESE WERE NOT LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT BUT BACK NAY JUST GIVE YOU SOME CONTEXT INTO WHAT'S HAPPENING THAT INCLUDED VENTURA. AND MY GROUNDS IN ORANGE COUNTY. SO AGAIN I WILL TELL YOU WE DON'T HAVE DATA ANALYST OF BECAUSE IT'S TOUGH TO FIND DATA. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S ILLEGAL THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO REPORT GREAT SO THE REASON I WAS ASKING IS BECAUSE THAT THERE'S INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE WHAT THEY CALL SHOPPERS WHO GO UNDERCOVER TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE ARE FALLING RULES ARE BEING. AT SERVE LIKE THE M. SELLING. CIGARETTES TO MINORS OR ALCOHOL TO MINORS SO THERE'S UNDER COVER. SO I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AND- IT COULD BE CORRECTED ON THIS BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY DO THE SAME THING AT GUN SHOWS AND I'M NOT SURE THAT. ANYONE WITH THE WITH THE NOTION OF HAVING A BUSINESS AND BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR THE ONE SOUTH. WOULD PURPOSELY BREAK THE LAW- IN THAT ENDEAVOR- JUST SO HAT THEY CAN LOSE THEIR LIVES. I'M THINKING AS A REAL ESTATE LICENSE- THAT. REALTOR BEFORE I WOULDN'T. DO SOMETHING ILLEGAL. AND RISK YOU KNOW THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE FOR ME. FOR MYSELF FOR MY FAMILY. AND SO I'M JUST THINKING OF. GUN OWNERS AND- PEOPLE WHO WHO SELL GUNS. I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF THEY WOULD PURPOSELY. SELLS GUNS NOT FOLLOWING THE PROTOCOL THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE FALL I WILL CONFESS TO I'VE NEVER BEEN INVOLVED IN THE ILLEGAL OR ATTEMPTED AND- TALE TOLD IS THAT THERE'S TWO TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE PROBLEMATIC AND KEEP IN MIND WE'RE IN THE ERA OF ANIMAL PAY PAL. YOU KNOW A WHOLE BUNCH OF WAYS YOU KNOW BIG COIN CRYPTOCURRENCY I DON'T WANT TO WASTE TO TRANSFER MONEY- AND CREATE TRANSACTIONS- YOU KNOW THAT THAT GO UNDETECTED- BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS YOU HAVE SOME OF THE UNSCRUPULOUS DEALERS AND I DON'T KNOW THEIR MOTIVATIONS IF THERE MAYBE. I DON'T KNOW HOW ROBUST THE UNDERCOVER POLICE PRESENCES MAYBE THERE'S NOT THAT WORRIED ABOUT BEING CAUGHT. AND THEN THERE'S ALSO JUST PEOPLE WHO GO TO THESE THINGS YOU KNOW IN IN YOU KNOW JUST GO OUT IN THE OFFICE PEOPLE TALKING ENGAGING WITH EACH OTHER- AND HAVING THAT TYPE OF SECONDARY TRANSACTION. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE LICENSED DEALERS THAT THAT'S KIND OF MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS THAT OCCUR. BUT I WOULD EMPHASIZE AS I SAID EARLIER IN MY OPENING EVEN IF WE HAD ZERO ILLEGAL TRANSACTIONS SO WE COULD GET IT TO THAT POINT. I STILL THINK THERE'S A GENERAL PRINCIPLE HERE. WE HAVE AND MY UNDERSTANDING SOMETHING LIKE A HUNDRED TWENTY GUNS PER HUNDRED PEOPLE ADULTS IN THIS COUNTRY- THAT TO ME IS YOU KNOW IT'S EXPONENTIALLY HIGHER THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY I THINK THE NEXT CLOSEST IS LIKE THIRTY GUNS PER HUNDRED PEOPLE. OUT WE HAVE AN EPIDEMIC OF GUNS AND NOT WITHSTANDING THE FAKE STUDIES OUT THERE WHAT'S VERY CLEAR IS MORE GUNS AS YOU WOULD EXPECT LEAD TO MORE GUN VIOLENCE MORE GUN HOMICIDES MORE GUN INJURIES. MORE SUICIDES MORE CRIME TO. ANSWER AS MUCH AS WE ALL LIKE TO THINK I HAVE A GUN I'M GONNA BE ABLE STOP THE CRIMINAL. YOU KNOW I HAD SOMEONE TELL ME THE OTHER DAY THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM SHOULD GET GUNS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND IT'S SOMEONE WHOSE WIFE WORKS IN A CERVANTES THINKING THAT'S INSANE. YOU KNOW BECAUSE THE FIRST THING YOU SAID WOULD DO IS TAKE YOUR GUN FROM YOU AND USE IT AGAINST YOU- AND GUNS IN A DOMESTICALLY ABUSIVE HOUSEHOLD ARE A TOTALLY CORRELATED THING WITH WITH THE LIKELIHOOD OF GUN. DEATHS AND SO I THINK THERE'S A PRINCIPLE HERE THAT. I RESPECTFULLY TAXPAYERS YEAH I'M NOT NEED LIKE UTILIZING TAXPAYER ON THEN YOU SHOULD NOT FINALIZED ALL. PROMULGATE THE. THE DISTRIBUTION MORE GUNS IN OUR AND- HE- THAT'S CORRECT ALL THANK YOU GET A THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WHY. ALL OKAY WELL THANK YOU VERYMUCH FOR YOUR CONCERN AND I JUST WANT IS JUST STATE pHAS A VERY DEEP RESPECT FOR GUNS I UNDERSTAND- YOU KNOW THEIR POTENTIAL AND SO FORTH AND I DO ALSO WANT TO STATE. EVER HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH IN- EXASPERATING THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE WITH GUN VIOLENCE SO I DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT THAT RESPECT BUT I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ONCE AGAIN- FOR MANY PEOPLE IT IS A CULTURAL AND FAMILY AFFAIR- WHERE THERE IS WHERE I THINK WHERE THERE'S A HEALTHY MINDSET AROUND IT AND- AND WE HAVE TO BE SENSITIVE AND RESPECTFUL TO THAT AS WELL- YOU KNOW I'M NOT OK WITH USING GUNS IN A IN AND IN A HARMFUL WAY TOWARDS ANY HUMAN BEING I JUST ABSOLUTELY I'M APPALLED BY BYE SUCH A FACTOR BUT I DO RECOGNIZE THAT FOR SOME PEOPLE. IT IS A TRADITION- AND WITH NO- ILL INTENT TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS BUT MORE OF A JUST A JUST STATE- CULTURAL ENDEAVOR IN FOR SOME- IT'S ALSO MODE OR A WAY OF PROVIDING FOR THEMSELVES- AND WITH AND WITH THAT I JUST WANNA FINALIZED MY. LAST POINT IS THAT. I REALLY WANTED CREDIT TO THE- AGRICULTURE DISTRICTS IN THE FAIR BOARD SAID- TO. HAVE THE A TOP TO DECIDE. WHAT IS REFLECTIVE OF THEIR COMMUNITY AND WHAT WORKS BEST FOR THEIR COMMUNITY. AND THAT THOSE BOARDS ARE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR. JUST WANT TO STATE THOSE BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR FOR PRESENTING THIS BILL IMPROVE AND BRING IT FOR. RECEIVE YOUR PERSPECTIVE CENTER. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS QUESTIONS COMMITTEE MEMBER. NINETEEN NINE. SERMON ALLOWED TO CLOSE. YES YOU THE TERM- SO I WANTED TO- CLOSE BY FIVE AGAIN MAKING SURE WE'RE NOT LOSING SO THE BIGGER PICTURE- THE EVIDENCE IS OVER THAT GUY IN OUR COMMUNITY CREATES ONE VIOLENCE AND I THINK IT WAS BROUGHT EARLIER BY THE REPRESENTED FROM R. P. THE THIS BILL WOULD LEAD TO MORE LAW I SUBMIT TO YOU ALL RESPECT FOR. THAT IF WE KEEP WITH THE STATUS THERE WERE BE COSTLY LAWSUITS BECAUSE AT SOME POINT THERE WILL BE A CLEAR LINKAGE BETWEEN GUNS SOLD AT GUN SHOWS AND THE NEXT GUN MASSACRE AND WHILE WE WERE ALL SPEAKING THERE IS YET ANOTHER GUN MASSACRE IN THE SUBURBS OF ATLANTA WHERE SEVERAL PEOPLE AT LEAST HAVE DIED SO FAR IN THIS SERIES OF SPAS AND SALONS. ARE IN AS WE OPEN UP MORE WE'RE GONNA START HEARING MORE ABOUT ACTS OF MASSIVE GUN VIOLENCE NOT JUST THE HOME SHOOTINGS OR HOMICIDES AND SUICIDES THAT YOU KNOW KIND OF WENT UNDER THE RADAR LAST YEAR BUT WE'LL START SEEING A LOT OF MASS SHOOTINGS AGAIN THIS MAY BE UNFORTUNATELY THE HARBINGER OF MANY MORE- WE IN THIS STATE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE AN ACTION THAT I THINK IS APPROPRIATE. IT'S SYMBOLIC BUT IT IS NOT OVER REACH ON BEHALF OF THE STATE IT SIMPLY STATES THAT WE THE STATE DO NOT WANT TO GIVE OUR ENDORSEMENT AND IMPRIMATUR TO OUR TAXPAYER OWNED VENUES BEING USED TO SELL MORE GUNS IN OUR COMMUNITIES TO ME THIS IS A STATEMENT OF STANDING UP TO GUN VIOLENCE AND TRYING TO DO WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ARE TELLING US WE NEED TO DO WHICH IS REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF GUNS THAT ARE IN OUR SOCIETY. THANK YOU SO MUCH COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND CHAIRMAN I RESPECTFULLY. ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. Q. WHO. WE HAVE A BUY RECOMMENDATION A TO PASS TO THE COMMITTEE ON RURAL. WE'RE SICK A MOST ON B. SIX FOUR. MORE OVER. SPIN MOVE BY SO. SCANNER MISS MISS WILL YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON S. B. TWO C. FOUR PASS TO COMMITTEE ON RULES SB TWO SIX FOUR DEEP. COMMITTEE ON RULE BRADFORD OUR BRADFORD AYE CHIU ABOVE NO. TROUBLE NO LONGER. AMARGA SKINNER. SKINNER AYE WIENER RIGHT WIENER I'VE. ONE IN ORDER OUT FOR THE THANK YOU FOR YOUR- LAST BUT NOT LEAST WE HAVE SO. WIENER WITH THOSE B. TWO SEVEN ONE MISTER CHAIRMAN IF I MAY UM WE OUR CENTER GROVE'S. THANK. TWENTY PEDICEL SHOWER CAP ON. RIGHT HOW YOU DO IT K. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR M. SO I UNDERSTAND THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE CONCERNED THAT THE BILL MAY HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SB THIRTY NINE IS THE BILL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- THAT INMATES HAVE ALREADY BEEN RELEASED FROM PRISON MAYBE FLAT FOR FRAUDULENT CLAIMS EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE NO LONGER SERVING A PRISON TERM. THE LANGUAGE IN SB THIRTY NINE SPECIFICALLY STATES AND I QUOTE THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION SHALL PROVIDE THE NAMES AND SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS CONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL LAW OF CURRENT INMATES. SO IT'S THEIR THIRD LANGUAGE SAYS THAT IN THE BILL THAT THEY WON'T PROVIDE ANY LANGUAGE OUTSIDE ARE THEY WON'T PROVIDE ANY SAW SECURITY NUMBERS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN RELEASED- I AGREES THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY. M. WHO. WHO IS. IN THE PRISON SYSTEM I DON'T WANT TO HURT ANYBODY LIKE IF THEY'VE WORKED IN. THEIR THERE AND THEY'RE ENTITLED TO BENEFITS FOR THE PREVIOUS TIME THAT THEY WORK AND WE DON'T WANT TO WRAPPED UP IN THIS IF. THEY GET OUT DESERVE SERVE THEIR TERM AND THEY GET A JOB WE DON'T WANT THEM WRAPPED UP IN THIS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS PREVENT. AND I DO HAVE AN UPDATED NUMBER FOR YOU ALMOST TWO BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF FRAUD THAT HAS BEEN PAID INTO. THE PRISON SYSTEM AND I DID TALK TO DA'S TO FOLLOW UP WITH ANOTHER QUESTION THAT YOU HAD EARLIER TODAY. THEY ARE- SOME OF THEM ARE USING PEOPLE'S NAMES LIKE DIANNE FEINSTEIN. BUT A LOT OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE PROSECUTING INMATES BECAUSE THAT MONEY FROM THE EDT IS GOING TO THEIR BOOKS. IN THERE- WHATEVER FINISHED FIRST RIVER PRESENTER. PLACE THAT THEY'RE SERVING OUT SO I DID CONFIRM THAT AS WELL AND. I HAVE LANGUAGE ON. OR WHAT IS REQUESTED SO THIS BILL SAYS IN THE EXACT LANGUAGE NOTWITHSTANDING ANY LAW. OR DEPARTMENT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION SHALL PROVIDE THE NAMES ANSEL SECURITY NUMBERS. CONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL LAW OF CURRENT INMATES THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT FOR THE PART TO THE DEPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT FOR THE PURPOSES SET FORTH IN SECTION THREE TWENTY ONE POINT FIVE AND EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE COAT. THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IN CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION CHAU PROVIDE THE INFORMATION TO THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT PERMIT PURSUANT TO THIS PARAGRAPH UPON THE REQUEST OF THE EMPLOYMENT DURING THE DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. ONLY FOR CURRENT INMATES. THE LANGUAGE- ON AN AMENDMENT THAT I'M ASKING TO TAKE IN ALL WORK WITH ANYBODY ON IN A MINUTE SO THAT WE CAN NARROW THIS DOWN I DON'T I ON'T HAVE AN ISSUE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT AMENDMENT LOOKS LIKE THE CLOSEST OF LANGUAGE THAT I HAVE IS THAT. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S CONCERNS AND- THE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DATA FROM CDC ARE AN EDT USES LIKE UTILIZES CURRENT. CURRENT AND IS CURRENT AND REPRESENTS INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CURRENTLY INCARCERATED. SO AND- DOES THAT HELP OR NOT THE ORIGINAL YES MA'AM SENATE- ED CENTER GROVE GREATLY APPRECIATE YOUR COMING BACK AND GREATLY APPRECIATE THAT THE BILL ALREADY SAYS THAT CDCR MUST. REVISED CURRENT DATA HOWEVER WE KNOW THE PART OF THIS PROBLEM IS BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY MANY OF OUR STATE AGENCIES HAVE VERY ARCHAIC SYSTEMS. AND YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT UP TO DATE IT EVEN EDT ITSELF HAS CLEARLY ITS OWN ARCHAIC SYSTEMS HAS LED TO MUCH OF THIS SO. THE BILL NOW STATES THAT CDC ARE MOST SUPPLY CURRENT BUT NOT THAT E. D. D. MUST ONLY USE CURRENT SO IN OTHER WORDS LET'S FACE CDCR SUPPLIES THE LIST. THERE TO YEAR TO LATER BEFORE RUNS. THAT LIST AGAINST IT'S YOU KNOW IT IT'S A- APPLICANTS FOR SO IT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE IS pCDC ARE ONLY SUPPLY CURRENT LIST BUT THAT D. D. D. ONLY USES A CURRENT LIST SO IT'S KIND OF THAT. SO WORK WITH YOU AND YOU YEAH MAN MAN IF WE CAN GET THAT AMENDMENT IN LABOR THAT WOULD BE GREAT THEN IT WOULD MAKE ME FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT WE ARE THEN ADDING ON AND I KNOW IT'S NOT YOUR INTENTION TO MAKE ANYONE WHO. IS INNOCENT HAVE TO FIGHT A FRAUD CHARGE BECAUSE THAT IS TERRIBLE AND A CERTAINLY IF YOU ALREADY HAD IDENTITY THEFT WHICH WE KNOW. SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE JUST LIKE WE KNOW THAT DIANNE FEINSTEIN'S NAME THERE WERE NICK NAMES OF PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED. SO THEY WERE EXPERIENCED IDENTITY THEFT SO WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH IDENTITY THEFT WE DON'T ALSO THEM TO BE CHARGED WITH FRAUD. DO I NIGHT I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT SO I'LL I'LL WORK WITH YOU I MISS SKINNER. AND MR PERRIN OR SENATOR SKINNER- WE ARE ON- WHATEVER AND THEN WE WORK OUT TO COME FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN IT'S NOT MY INTENT. TO NOT ALLOW PEOPLE WHO ARE ENTITLED TO BENEFITS TO HAVE BENEFITS MY INTENT IS TO. STOP THE FRAUDULENT BENEFITS BEING PAID OUT THAT'S THE INTENT. OF THE BILL AND- SO I WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR AYE THAT. THIRD WINNER THANK YOU A FOR YOUR FOR HER COMING BACK SENATE- YEAH I THINK- WHAT WE'VE LEARNED OVER THE LAST YEAR AND I PAINS ME TO SAY THIS BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE WORKING IN TV BUT THE SYSTEM ITSELF IS NOT ABOUT THE INDIVIDUALS IT'S A SYSTEM. THIS IS PROGRAM PERHAPS BEYOND REPAIR- AND WE WE'VE LEARNED IN THE LAST YEAR IS THAT IF YOU DO HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET SOMETHING WRONG UNFORTUNATELY IT'S LIKELY THAT THEY WILL AND IT AGAIN SOMEONE HAS BEEN IN GOVERNMENT FOR A LONG TIME REALLY PAINS ME TO SAY THAT BUT WE'VE ALL SEEN IT IN OUR DISTRICTS THE DISASTER- AND SO. I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IN E. D. IN THE DATA TRANSFER OR WILL GET A RIGHT AND THERE'LL BE PEOPLE WHO GOT FROZEN ON SUSPICION MASS AND SO I GUESS WHAT I WOULD JUST ASK IS THIS COSTA LABOR NEXT TO BE GOOD- AND- I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THE VERSION GOALS WE WANT TO HAVE GUARD RAILS.

TIME TO GET TO OUR SHARED GOAL THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO GO UP IN THE BILL BASED ON THAT REPRESENTATION NO ABSOLUTELY I JUST I DID MAKE THAT COMMITMENT THAT I WOULD WORK WITH YOU BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SAME GOAL IN MIND IT'S NOT MY INTENT. TO HURT ANYBODY WHO IS QUALIFIED AND ELIGIBLE FOR BENEFITS WHETHER THEY'RE IN CARS THEY HAVE BEEN INCARCERATED OR NOT IT'S- MICHAEL TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ENTITLED TO BENEFITS GET BENEFITS BUT THOSE THAT ARE NOT ENTITLED TO BENEFITS DON'T GET BENEFITS- SO ABSOLUTELY I'LL WORK WITH YOU ON AN AMENDMENT TO TAKE IN A MINUTE AND LABOR ONCE WE WORK OUT WHAT THAT IS- BUT WE HAVE THE SAME GAL.

SKINNER OUR SKINNER AYE IN THE CONSENT CALENDAR SOUTH FIVE ZERO SIX CALENDARS OUT FIVE ZERO THANK YOU. SAVE THE BEST FOR LAST. OKAY THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN THE ON DRUG. PARKWAY TODAY- SURVIVE MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COLLEAGUES SOUGHT- SENATE BILL TWO SEVENTY WINE IS A IMPORTANT CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND POLICE REFORM BILL- THE PROMOTES DIVERSITY IN THE MOCK CHRISSY AND SHERIFF ELECTIONS THAT'S TWO TO SEVENTY ONE WILL GIVE VOTERS AN ACTUAL CHOICE COOPER WHO SHOULD REINER WHO CAN RUN WHAT IS FREQUENTLY A LARGE GOVERNMENT AGENCY ENGAGING NOT SYSTEM POLICING BUT ALSO MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH CARE DEATH INVESTIGATIONS ANOTHER WAS CORNER- AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS IN ADDITION TO OVERSEEING A LARGE GOVERNMENT BUDGET. THE SERVICE FREQUENTLY THE MOST POWERFUL ELECTED POSITION IN A COUNTY WHICH HUGE AND VARIED RESPONSIBILITIES IT ONLY ONE PARTICULAR LIMITED DEMOGRAPHIC LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHO'VE WORKED AS AN OFFICER AT SOME POINT IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS ARE ELIGIBLE TO RUN LET'S REMEMBER THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS AREN'T JUST ABOUT POLICING FOR EXAMPLE THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY JAIL IS THE LARGEST MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER IN THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND YET ONLY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ARE ELIGIBLE TO LEAD THAT DEPARTMENT AND THAT MASSIVE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM NOT SURPRISINGLY GIVEN THE STRANGULATION OF REAL COMPETITION CALIFORNIA SHERIFFS ARE OVERWHELMINGLY WHITE MEN FORTY NINE OUT OF FIFTY EIGHT WITH ONLY FOUR WOMEN AND ZERO BLOCK PEOPLE SERVING A SHERIFF'S IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOT SURPRISINGLY SHARP ELECTIONS ARE VERY OFTEN UNCONTESTED BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY ONE SLIVER OF. A DEMOGRAPHIC THAT'S ELIGIBLE TO RUN. THE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS. AND INDEED FOR LARGEMENT OF CALIFORNIA HISTORY IT WASN'T THIS WAY FROM EIGHTEEN FIFTY THE FOUNDING OF OUR STATE UNTIL NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE YEARS. ANYONE COULD RUN FOR SHERIFF AND THE SKY DID NOT FALL. IN TWENTY FOUR STATES ALMOST HALF F THE STIFFNESS COUNTRY ANYONE IS A REGISTERED VOTER CAN RUN FOR SHERIFF. ONLY FIFTEEN STATES INCLUDING CALIFORNIA REQUIRES THAT THE SHERIFF BE A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER BECAUSE MOST STATES NOW FOR THE SERVICE ISN'T JUST ABOUT POLICING. SO WHY DID CALIFORNIA AFTER A HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE YEARS CHANGE IT'S SHERIFF ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS TO SAY THAT INSTEAD OF ANYONE BEING ABLE TO RUN ONLY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICES CAN RUN. THAT'S BECAUSE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE MY COUNTY SAN FRANCISCO ELECTED A PRISONER RIGHTS ATTORNEY BY THE NAME OF MICHAEL HENNESSY TO BE SURE- AND JUST TO BE BLUNT THE SHERIFF'S FREAKED OUT. FREAKED OUT THAT SOMEONE WAS IMPINGING ON THEIR TURF. EARLIER PROGRESSIVE REFORMER SO THEY CAME TO THIS BUILDING AND THEY GOT A LAW PASSED TO CORNER THE MARKET AND CREATE A MONOPOLY SO THE ONLY BETTER PEOPLE COULD RUN AND SO THERE WILL BE NO MORE MICHAEL HENNESSY'S IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY DEMOCRATS CREDIT. FOR THE RECORD MICHAEL HENNESSY SERVED AS SHERIFF OF SAN FRANCISCO FOR THIRTY TWO YEARS REAL IT WAS ELECTED EIGHT TIMES HE WAS UNIVERSALLY RESPECTED IN OUR CITY EVEN BY THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SKEPTICAL OF HIM AT THE BEGINNING HE INSTITUTED TRENDSETTING EDUCATIONAL. PROGRAMS HE ESTABLISH A CHARTER HIGH SCHOOL IN SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY JAIL THE FIRST IN THE COUNTRY A GROUNDBREAKING MENTAL HEALTH AND REHABILITATION PROGRAMS THE SKY DIDN'T FALL WHEN SHERIFF MIKE HENNESY BECAME SHERIFF IN SEARCH FOR THIRTY TWO YEARS. BUT IT DID TRIGGER A REACTIONARY BACKLASH THE OPPOSITION SITES CERTAIN POSITIONS THAT HAVE PARTICULAR QUALIFICATIONS AND USES THOSE pAS EVIDENCE THAT THEY BALK YOUR QUALIFICATIONS FOR SOME OFFICES MAYBE SHOULD HAVE QUALIFICATIONS FOR OFFICES BUT REMEMBER THAT THE CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER OF CALIFORNIA. ATTORNEY GENERAL DOES NOT. HAVE TO BE A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. THE DIRECTOR OF FBI. DOES NOT HAVE TO BE A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER THE SECRETARY OF CDCR DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE BEEN A PRISON GUARD. THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE NEVER HAD TO SERVE IN THE MILITARY AND ALL THESE POSITIONS WE HIRE THE PERSON THAT WE BELIEVE. AS MOST COMPETENT TO RUN THE AGENCY AND NOT QUITE TWENTY FOUR STATES DO IT THE WAY THAT SB TWO SEVENTY ONE PROPOSES. NINE IT IS A STRONG ARGUMENT THAT IF WE BELIEVE IN CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT. AND MAKES SENSE TO ALLOW A WIDE VARIETY OF PEOPLE TO RUN. RESTORING BROADER ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS TO SHERIFF WILL ALLOW BROADER POOL OF CANDIDATES TO RUN. WITH MORE DIVERSE SKILL SETS. AND MORE- JUST DIVERSITY TO PRESENT TO THE COMMUNITY- SO WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE DYSFUNCTION SOME OF OUR SERVICE DEPARTMENTS WE HAVE SHERIFFS TO. VIOLATE STATE LAW BY COOPERATING WITH ICE WE HAVE SHERIFFS WHO REFUSED TO ENFORCE COBIT HELP ORDERS WE HAVE SHERIFFS. THIS IN ALL SERVICE WE HAVE SHERIFFS WHO RUNNING. JAILS ARE VERY PROBLEMATIC WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE DYING. FROM THE SHERIFFS ARE OFTEN RUNNING FOR REELECTION UNOPPOSED BECAUSE ONLY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS CAN RUN AGAINST THEM. WE KNOW THAT WE'RE IN A RACIAL RECKONING IN THIS COUNTRY I'M POLICING HAS TO CHANGE AND THIS IS A COMMONSENSE REFORM. TO BROADEN THE POOL OF PEOPLE ELIGIBLE TO BE SHERIFF. AND TO BRING OUR SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT INTO THE MODERN WORLD. BUT OF COURSE NOTHING PROHIBITS A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER IN THIS BILL FROM RUNNING FOR SHERIFF. SO WITH ME TODAY TESTIFIED OUR ORAL THOMAS WHO THE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS DIRECTOR I CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER.

AND WE HAVE NICK- DEATH- ZERO FOUR WITNESSES ARE. ALREADY I WILL START WITH MISTER CELLS ALL. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CORY CELLS L. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION EXISTING LAW REQUIRES A CANDIDATE FOR THE OFFICE OF THE SHERIFF TO HAVE EARNED AN ADVANCED CERTIFICATE FROM THE COMMISSION ON PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING OR DEMONSTRATE A COMBINATION OF FULL TIME LAW ENFORCEMENT WORK EXPERIENCE AND EDUCATION. THIS BILL BELIEVES THAT REQUIREMENT AND REPLACES IT WITH NOTHING IN A TIME WHEN MORE ACCOUNTABILITY AND PROFESSIONALISM ARE BEING SOUGHT FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT LEADERS MAKES NO SENSE TO RAISE THE STANDARDS. FURTHER ALLOWING ANY REGISTERED VOTER TO RUN WILL ACTUALLY REDUCE ACCOUNTABILITY BECAUSE CANDIDATES WITHOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT EXPERIENCE WILL NOT HAVE GONE THROUGH A RIGOROUS PEACE OFFICER BACKGROUND CHECK QUITTING A PSYCHOLOGICAL EXAM. IN COMPARISON AS THE AUTHOR NOTED IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT OTHER ELECTED COUNTY OFFICES HAVE EXPERIENCE AND EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS AND STATURE THIS BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS THOSE. THE COUNTY AUDITOR MUST HAVE FIELD EXPERIENCE TO BE A CERTIFICATE ACCOUNTANT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY MUST BE ADMITTED TO PRACTICE. BEFORE THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT AND INDEED THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S NOT REQUIRED TO BE A PEACE OFFICER. BUT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS REQUIRED TO BE AN ATTORNEY. WE DISAGREE THAT THE OFFICE THE SURE SHOULD BE SINGLED OUT AND HAVE STANDARDS FOR THE JOB LOWERED. RELATEDLY THERE'S AN ONGOING DISCUSSION ABOUT HAVING RANK AND FILE PEACE OFFICERS HAVE MORE EDUCATION BE ELIGIBLE SERVICE. THIS BILL SEEMS TO MOVE IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. SHARES OF MANY DIFFERENT RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDING OFTEN DIRECTING OR SERVING AS CORNER PUBLIC ADMINISTRATOR. USUALLY COORDINATOR- AND SEVERAL OTHER ROLES AN ELECTED SHERIFF WITHOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT EXPERIENCE WILL INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE DELIVERY OF POOR DIRECTIVES AN INCREASE COUNTY LIABILITY. MUTUAL AID AVAILABILITY AND RESPONSE WILL SUFFER IF THERE ARE AGENCIES HOMES BY PERSONS WITHOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT EXPERIENCE. PERHAPS MORE SPECIFICALLY IN EVERY COUNTY SHERIFF'S MAKE CRITICAL DECISIONS THAT KIND OF LIFE AND DEATH OUTCOMES THERE ARE MANY SMALL COUNTIES WHERE THE SHERIFF IS IN THE FIELD DOING PATROL WORK OR WORKING IN THE JAIL. CONTRARY TO THE PROPONENTS ASSERTIONS THE SHERIFF IS MORE THAN JUST A MANAGER OF AN APARTMENT. IN RECENT COURT CASES RELATED TO THE STATUTE IN QUESTION. THE SIX DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL SAID QUOTE THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE STATE HAS A STRONG INTEREST IN ASSURING THAT A PERSON WITH ASPIRATIONS TO HOLD OFFICE IS QUALIFIED TO ADMINISTER THE COMPLEXITY THAT OFFICE. FOR THE CLARIFYING AND ROLLS. THE COURT SAID THIS SECTION DOES NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPAIR ACCESS TO THE BALLOT THERE ARE FIVE BROAD QUALIFICATIONS. WHICH EMBRACE PEOPLE OF VARYING EXPERIENCE THIS SECTION DOES NOT STIFLE SPEECH FOR DICTATE COLLECTOR OUTCOMES IN ANY SENSE FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY. REQUEST YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU MATATUS. THANK YOU CHAIR AND NOT COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME'S NICO NOW TO HAVE NEARLY NINETEEN YEARS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT EXPERIENCE WITH THE TRI COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE. WHAT THE PRESIDENT AND- THEN CHECK ANY DEPUTY SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE PEACE OFFICERS RESEARCH RESEARCH ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. I'M HERE TODAY REPRESENTING THE PEACE OFFICERS RESEARCH ASSOCIATION IN CALIFORNIA. I CONCUR- WITH MR CELL DEALS POINT ENOUGH- BILL TWO SEVEN ONE. BUT TODAY I WANTED TO PROVIDE YOUR PERSPECTIVE- AND THE IMPACT OR RANK AND FILE DEPUTIES. THERE REALLY TWO PRIMARY ISSUES WITH ABOUT TWO SEVENTY ONE AT THAT APPLIES THE RANK AND FILE DEPUTIES. FIRST IS THE SAFETY THE SAFETY OF RANK AND FILE OFFICERS. SHERIFF'S IS DESIGNATED TO MAKE CRITICAL DECISIONS THAT THAT RELATES TO TACTICS AND RESPONSIVE. IN SERIOUS INCIDENTS INVOLVING DEPUTY RESPONSES. SHERIFF WITH NO REAL PEACE OFFICER EXPERIENCE CREEK INSTITUTION IN WHICH DEPUTIES COULD BE NEEDED NEEDLESSLY PUT IN HARM'S WAY. IN A RANK AND FILE SYSTEM THE SHERA MUST MAKE CRITICAL DECISIONS THAT NOT ONLY ALLOWED DEPUTIES THE ABILITY TO SAFELY CARRY OUT THERE FIND OUT. BUT IT CAN ALSO CREATE A SITUATION IN WHICH- COMPROMISED THE SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC. I CAN ISSUES RELATED TO TRAINING TRAINING RANK AND FILE OFFICERS. SHERIFF'S DECADES TRAINING AND BUDGET RELATING TO TRAINING FOR THE DEPUTY WHICH- UNDER FOR HIS WATCH THE TRAINING OF POLICE OFFICERS IS VITALLY IMPORTANT. AND I'M SURE THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE WITH THAT THERE IS ALSO A WIDE ARRAY OF TRAINING FOR PEACE OFFICERS IN THIS PROFESSION. HOWEVER WITH SENATE BILL TWO SEVENTY ONE IT CREATES ISSUES IN WHICH ELECTED SHERA. MAY HAVE LESS TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE THAN EVEN THE NEWEST DEPUTIES WITH THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE OUR DEPARTMENT. IT ALSO CREATES IN MICHIGAN WHICH THEY SHARE. WITH NO REAL PEACE OUT THERE AT THE TOP SEARCH EXPERIENCE HAS NOTHING TO DRAW FROM WHEN DETERMINING A TRAINING PRIORITIES. AND TRAINING BUDGETS. THIS FEASIBLY COULD CREATE A WORKFORCE ADEPT LASTRA. AND ALL- IMPORTANT CAN YOU ISSUE. AND THEN FIND I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE SECOND DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS SPOKE TO THIS ISSUE IN A TWENTY NINETEEN RULING. LAWYER V. VAREN VENT ABERCYNON VENTURA COUNTY. IN THIS CASE MISTER BOYER WHO HAD NO PRIOR PEACE TALKS YOUR EXPERIENCE DESIRE TO RUN. FOR SHERIFF IN VENTURA COUNTY. IN THE CALL WILL MADE. THAT THERE IS A GOOD WHY THE LEGISLATURE HAS IMPOSED AN EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENT FOR SHARE OF. TO GET A FEEL FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO COME DO A TRUE UNDERSTANDING OF THAT YOU MUST LEARN ABOUT IT IN THE FIELD BY DOING THAT. THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN WELL SERVED BY PERSONNEL WHO HAVE WORKED THEIR WAY UP THE CHAIN OF COMMAND AND LEADERSHIP. SUCH PERSONNEL HAVE BEEN YEARS OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE. EXPERIENCE IS THE BEST TEACHER. IN CLOSING I BELIEVE THE EXISTING LAW WIRING ELIGIBILITY FOR SHARE SELECTIONS ARE IMPORTANT FOR THE RANK AND FILE DEPUTIES ABOUT IT SUBMITS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. LET'S GO TO OUR ROOM HERE FORTY TWO OLD THREE AND SEE IF THERE'S ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF S. B. TWO SEVEN ONE. SHEEN NINE IN THE ROOM LET'S GO NOW TO ROOM TWENTY FORTY ANY WITNESSES THERE IN SUPPORT OF TWENTY FORTY SEEN NINE THAT'S OUR GO TO OUR MODERATOR. DO WE HAVE CALLERS IN Q. AND- OPPOSITION I SHOULD SAY- SB. TWO SEVEN ONE. THANK YOU IF YOU WISH TO MAKE A COMMENT IN OPPOSITION OF S. B.% TWO SEVEN ONE PLEASE PRESS ONE AND ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND I DO HAVE A COUPLE IN Q. NINE FOUR SEVEN THREE PLEASE GO AHEAD. MEMBERS OF THE ANTILLES CHARLIE HALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION WE ARE ACTUALLY CO SPONSORS AND SUPPORT OF THE BELGIAN. BERNIE ABOUT TO GET EARLIER THANK YOU. Q. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT ONE THIRTY THREE PLEASE GO AHEAD. YOUR MEMBERS LINE SHERMAN WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT ONE FIFTY SIX PLEASE CALL HAS. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS BRENDA THAT REPRESENT THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU AS A REMINDER IF YOU WISH TO MAKE A COMMENT IN OPPOSITION OF S. B. TWO SEVEN ONE PLEASE PRESS ONE AND ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU. ARE BRINGING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. RAGE HERE BY THE COMMITTEE. REALLY SENATOR- TO A BOWL IN THE ESSENCE OF TIME- JUST JUST A COMMENT I AM I THINK IT JUST WANNA POINT OUT ONCE AGAIN THE OBSERVATIONS THAT FIRST OF ALL I ATE I HAVE A 8% A DISTRICT WHOSE SHERIFFS ARE. VERY WELL APPRECIATED AND I WOULD SAY LOVED BY MANY OF OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS VERY WELL RESPECTED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES AS WELL AND NUMBER TWO. I THANK YOU SOMETHING HAS TO BE SAID WITH REGARDS TO HAVING- EXPERIENCE IN HOLDING THIS OFFICE- JUST LIKE THE COUNTY AUDITORS DO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S TO TREASURE TAX COLLECTORS WHO HAVE TO HAVE SOME THAT EXPERIENCE WITHIN THAT FIELD IN ORDER TO SERVE IN THOSE CAPACITIES. I FEEL WITH THEIR LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITIES SUCH AS BEING AT OUR DIRECT IN THE CORNER AT THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATOR EMERGENCY OPERATIONS COORDINATOR MUTUALLY COORDINATOR ANIMAL SERVICES COURSERS AS EXETER EXETER I JUST A LINE OF THINGS THAT THEY OVERSEE. THAT IT DOES BEHOOVE HAVING SOME SORT OF- EXPERIENCE IN THE FIELD- WOULD YOU AGREE DISAGREE. OF COURSE WE WANT PEOPLE A GREAT EXPERIENCE TO RUN IMPORTANT AGENCY. AND SERVING AS A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER KEEP IN MIND YOU DON'T TO BE A DEPUTY SHERIFF. YOU COULD BE A- PARK POLICE OFFICER WHO'S NEVER SET FOOT IN A COUNTY JAIL. THANK YOU ARE THEN ELIGIBLE TO RUN TO BE THIS TO RUN THE JAIL. IT'S ABOUT SOMEONE WHO'S NEVER EVEN WORKED IN DETAILS. REMAIN ARBITRARY DISTINCTION THAT THESE PEOPLE CAN RUN THE CIVIL CARE. BUT IN TERMS OF EXPERIENCE IN THE REASON WHY TALK TO THE BEGINNING THIS IS MY VOICE ON ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE SURE OF DOGS. IN TERMS OF BEING A MAJOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER LIKE IT'S A YOU KNOW AN INQUIRY IT'S AN INDICTMENT OF OUR SYSTEM THAT THEY'D BETTER RESULTS HAVE TO BE OUR LARGEST MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS MAJOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. YOUR THE CORONER. THAT NUMBER CAN TALK ABOUT WHETHER IT SHOULD BE BUT THAT'S THE LAW CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW. ON YOUR AGENCIES SERVING PROCESS EVICTION. SO MANY THINGS SO THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF EXPERIENCES YOU COULD IMAGINE. SAYING OKAY WE HAVE A MAJOR MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS IN OUR JAILS WE WANT TO SERVE RIGHT NOW. WHOHAS A MAJOR BACKGROUND A MENTAL HEALTH. ISSUE TO THE VOTERS WANTING TO DO THAT AND SO YOU HAVE A VERY COMPETENT ADMINISTRATOR HO KNOWS HOW TO RUN A MAJOR ORGANIZATION. WITH AN EMPHASIS ON THE THINGS OF THE VOTERS. I THINK OUR- IS IMPORTANT AND SO YES EXPERIENCE MATTERS BY BEING A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER ISN'T THE ONLY KIND OF EXPERIENCE I COULD SET YOU OUGHT. TO BE- A- YOU KNOW A SHERIFF AND YES THERE ARE SOME POSITIONS THAT HAVE REQUIREMENTS. BUT YOUR SHERIFF IS A POWERFUL POSITION YOU KNOW WE COULD MAKE A DECISION THAT TO RUN FOR THE LEGISLATURE THE ONLY PEOPLE ELIGIBLE TO RUN FOR THE LEGISLATURE. ARE PEOPLE. WHO HAVE SERVED AS LEGISLATIVE AIDES. RIGHT NOW NOT FOR CENTER LONGER. WE WOULD YOU KNOW WE WOULD. PROBABLY NOT PASS A LAW IT'S GREAT TO HAVE FORMER LEGISLATIVE AIDES IN THE LEGISLATURE. BUT WE ALSO WANT TO HAVE A DIVERSITY OF OTHER KINDS OF PEOPLE AS WELL AND- AND THAT LEADS TO GOOD OUTCOMES. AND SO WE YOU KNOW I IN THE SAME IS TRUE THIS IS A MAJOR POSITION- WE DESERVE TO HAVE DIVERSITY. OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO RUN. THANK. I CENTER CENTER. THANK YOU ARE CHAIR- SENATOR WIENER I'M PREACHED OF THAT YOU BROUGHT THIS BILL AND I THINK WHILE THE POINTS MADE BY CERTAIN OF THE OPPONENTS WITH CONCERN- REGARDING THE- YOU KNOW THAT. SOMEHOW IT'S DOWNGRADING THE POSITION I THINK YOUR REFERENCE TO THE FACT THAT. DEAR THE SHERIFF IN SEARCHES GO FOR WHOM THIS BILL. WHAT I MEAN THE REASON THAT WE HAVE THE REQUIREMENT OF A PEACE OFFICER TO BE A SHERIFF WAS DUE TO MISTER HENNESSY SELECTION AND THEN. HIS SERVICE OVER DECADES WHICH WAS THEN SUPPORTED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUPS ACROSS THE STATE SO- IT'S- AND YOU ALSO MADE THE POINT JUST NOW ABOUT THAT YOU THAT THERE'S ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THOSE CATEGORIES DON'T NECESSARILY EQUATE TO HAVING THE SKILL SET THAT MANY OF THE OPPONENTS RAISED WAS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO BE A SHERIFF. SO I THINK THE KEY THING THAT THIS DOES IS GIVE COUNTY TO CHOICE CLEARLY DID FOR BY PREDOMINATE CANDIDATES WILL CONTINUE TO BE LAW ENFORCEMENT EVEN IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL WITH THE STATUTE. BECAUSE THERE WILL BE MANY COUNTIES THE PREFERRED THAT BUT FOR THOSE COUNTIES FOR WHOM THEY SEE THE JOB AS A ENCOMPASSING A MUCH LARGER ROLE AS YOU POINTED OUT WHICH IT DOES IN- MANY MANY COUNTIES. IT GIVES HOSE COUNTIES THEN THE CHOICE AND THE VOTERS THE CHOICE AND WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE VERY SUCCESSFUL EXAMPLES OF. EXTRAORDINARILY COMPETENT SHERIFFS WHO DID NOT MEET THE QUALIFICATIONS THE CRITERIA THAT IS NOW STATUTES. SO- HI I THINK IT'S A GOOD BILL ARE YOU ARE WHO REALIZE THEIR- THERE WILL BE LOTS WHO- WHO- TRADE INDICATE THAT SOMEHOW IT'S DILUTING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE- OF THE POSITION. BUT I DON'T THINK THAT IT DOES THAT SO. PRECIADO SUPPORTED BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR CALM WATER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO I EIGHT TWO I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL- I ACTUALLY YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS GOING TO ENCOURAGE CHANGE AGENTS TO RUN BUT IT STANDING THE POOL IS NEVER A BAD THING- I SUPPORT THAT. I ACTUALLY THINK ESPECIALLY IN LISTENING TO YOUR ARGUMENTS- I WOULD ENCOURAGE US TO KIND OF FIND A WAY TO WRITE RAISE THE BAR ON THE QUALIFICATIONS I MEAN PERSONALLY AND AT AT THE RISK OF OFFENDING ANYONE IN THIS ROOM INCLUDING MYSELF I THINK THE BAR IS INCREDIBLY LOW FOR RUNNING FOR OFFICE- AND WE TEND TO BE- VICTIM OF CULT OF PERSONALITY CANDIDATES. YOU KNOW WHAT I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF WE SHOULD BE ELECTING SHERIFFS QUITE FRANKLY YOU KNOW DO WE HAVE A DISCUSSION AROUND APPOINTING THEM I HAVE REAL CHALLENGES WITH SHERIFF CORONERS- SO I WOULD HOPE THAT THERE'S A WAY TO KIND OF YOU KNOW RAISE THE BAR BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT WHOEVER IS RUNNING FOR THIS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT POSITION SHOULD HAVE SOME UNDERSTANDING OF THE JOB YOU'VE REALLY SHARED FOR US HOW EXPANSIVE THE SCOPE OF THE JOB IT IS- AND SO HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE- SORT OF- SCOPING OUT THIS IN A WAY THAT ELEVATES FOLKS WHO REALLY COULD BE QUALIFIED CHANGE AGENTS. TO RUN FOR THESE PARTICULAR SEATS I THINK THE PAST TWO YEARS HAVE SHOWN AN ESPECIALLY IN MY COUNTY THAT WE DO OURSELVES A DISSERVICE- WHEN WE- DON'T REALLY FOCUS ON HOW TO CHANGE. YOU KNOW THE PLAYBOOK TO ALLOW FOR- DIFFERENT KINDS OF PERSPECTIVES- TO SPEAK OF THE% POSITION. OF SHERIFF SO I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT. AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL. THANK YOU AND I WANT TO THANK CENTER WINNER FOR AGAIN A COMMON SENSE MEASURE AGAIN I ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS LOOK TO THE CAREER OF HERE TENNESSEE TO KNOW THAT THE SKY DID NOT FALL INTO WILL NOT FALL IF WE GO BACK TO WHAT WAS ALREADY IN PLACE FOR. ALMOST A HUNDRED OVER A HUNDRED THIRTY YEARS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH NO INCIDENT AND IT IT'S IS NOT A DONDE ME THAT AT ONE POINT YOU COULD BE APPOINTED A JUDGE AND NOT BE A LAWYER. WE HAD FORMER SENATOR RALPH DEALS WHO WAS ON THE BENCH FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND IT NEVER GONNA LAW SCHOOL ANYBODY WAS APPOINTED AS A JUDGE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO YOU WILL AND TRUST FOLKS TO INTERPRET THE LAW FOR MORE FAR MORE THAN PEOPLE TO ENFORCE IT- I THINK WE NEED TO GO BACK TO COMMONSENSE APPROACH. TO LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE IT SAYS PEACE OFFICER AND ARE YOU YOU CAN MET. OUT PIECE WITHOUT BEING A- THE SCHOOL. OFFICER IN WHAT THE REAL ON FORCE IS BY MAINTAIN PEACE. AND AGAIN I THINK CENTER COM ARE CLEARLY ARTICULATED ISSUE. RAISE THE BAR OF ELECTED OFFICIALS I MEAN WE HAVE FOLKS WHO PRICE CERTAIN THE LEGISLATURE THAT DIDN'T EVEN GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL BUT THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR A MYRIAD OF ISSUES. THAT IMPACT EVERYBODY'S LIFE NOT TO NARROW ISSUE SUCH AS LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT WHITES WHAT THE ISSUES THAT WE DEAL WITH ON A DAILY BASIS AND CLEARLY- EIGHTY EIGHT EARLY. HI TO OF UNDERSTANDING HAS NEVER BEEN A BARTON ARE BERRIER FOR. A LOT OF OFFICES IN ALL I WOULD SAY IS LOOK TO THE LAST FOUR YEARS AT A WHITE HOUSE ME BE CLEARLY SHOWS THAT ANYBODY CAN BE PRESIDENT SO- I WOULD SAY. IT WE COULD TRUST. THAT INDIVIDUAL TO BE PRESIDENT WE SHOULD BUILD TRUST JOHN Q. CITIZEN WHO ASPIRES TO BE. THE SHERIFF OF ANY OF THESE COUNTIES THE RIGHT TO DO SO- HI I HAVE A FORMER- PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR.
