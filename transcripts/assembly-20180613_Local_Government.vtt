NOW AT THE PLACE WHERE WE CAN.

00:46:56.013 --> 00:46:57.681

NOW ARE ARE.

00:47:08.158 --> 00:47:09.359
CRITICS IN CHALLENGES FIRST OF

00:47:09.426 --> 00:47:09.927
ALL THE RESTRICTIONS THAT

ACCUMULATING.

00:47:12.329 --> 00:47:13.530
I NECESSARILY HIRE RESERVE

00:47:13.597 --> 00:47:14.698

00:47:14.765 --> 00:47:16.233
PURCHASE REQUIREMENT.

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:18.101
MADE SENSE AT THE TIME BUT NOW I

00:47:18.168 --> 00:47:19.469
TIMES AND GROUNDWATER

00:47:19.536 --> 00:47:21.038
REPLENISHING BEST PRACTICES IF

00:47:21.104 --> 00:47:23.574
CHANGE SO FLUCTUATIONS IN COST.

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:24.174
AND IN RELIABILITY OF SUPPLY

00:47:24.241 --> 00:47:27.244
HAVE [inaudible]

00:47:27.311 --> 00:47:29.279
PRACTICAL NEED TO BECOME

00:47:29.346 --> 00:47:31.014
INDEPENDENT OF IMPORTED WATER

00:47:31.081 --> 00:47:32.082
SHIFTING INSTEAD TO THE

00:47:32.149 --> 00:47:33.650
PRODUCTION OF LOCAL RELIABLE

00:47:33.717 --> 00:47:34.952

COAST GROUND WATER BASINS.

00:47:38.222 --> 00:47:39.890
SO THE IDEA WAS AT THE TIME THEY

00:47:39.957 --> 00:47:41.858
WANTED THE MONEY TO GO TOWARD

00:47:41.925 --> 00:47:43.627
WATER PURCHASES BY THERE'S NOW.

OF A PUSH TOWARD LOCAL

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:49.166
PRODUCTION.

00:47:49.233 --> 00:47:49.800
AND SO THAT THERE'S JUST BEEN A

00:47:49.866 --> 00:47:51.835
SHIFT IN THE IN THE WAY THAT

00:47:51.902 --> 00:47:53.303
THEY'VE BEEN THAT THEY COME TO

00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:55.038
SEE THEIR BUSINESS MODEL AND IT.

00:47:55.105 --> 00:47:56.206
AND IT'S VERY MUCH A COMPLIANCE

00:47:56.273 --> 00:47:57.207
WITH ENVIRONMENTAL BEST

00:47:57.274 --> 00:47:58.609

THOSE WHO ARE FROM THE AREA

00:48:00.444 --> 00:48:01.011
YOU'LL YOU'LL LIKE THE FACT THAT

00:48:01.078 --> 00:48:02.312

00:48:02.379 --> 00:48:02.613
I'M TRYING.

00:48:02.679 --> 00:48:05.882
TO REDUCE LOS ANGELES'S RELIANCE

00:48:05.949 --> 00:48:07.484

TO FORMING I'VE D. WERE NOW IN

00:53:01.511 --> 00:53:04.047
THE OF USING IT --

SACRAMENTO IS AN ONGOING

00:53:08.919 --> 00:53:10.654
MAINTENANCE BUT I CAN SPEAK FOR

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:12.055
CALOTES MEMBERSHIP IT IS AN

00:53:12.122 --> 00:53:13.423
ISSUE ACROSS THE STATUS THEY

CITIES LOOK AT THIS TOOL.

00:53:14.691 --> 00:53:16.293
SO I WANT TO GIVE A COUPLE OF

00:53:16.359 --> 00:53:18.728
PRACTICAL EXAMPLES FIRST DUB

00:53:18.795 --> 00:53:20.597
KIND OF FRAMING THE PROBLEMS ONE

00:53:20.664 --> 00:53:21.765
CITIES I DON'T THINK A LOT OF

00:53:21.831 --> 00:53:22.566
YOU HAVE LOOKED GOVERNMENT

00:53:22.632 --> 00:53:23.833

00:53:24.434 --> 00:53:25.368
BUILDING THINGS.

00:53:25.435 --> 00:53:26.803
BUT IT'S VERY HARD TO BUDGET

00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:27.837
MONEY FOR MAINTENANCE THAT'S

00:53:27.904 --> 00:53:29.406
JUST A FACT OF LIFE IN CITY

00:53:29.472 --> 00:53:30.173
GOVERNMENT --

00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:32.108

00:53:34.978 --> 00:53:36.112
PROJECTS ACROSS.

00:53:36.179 --> 00:53:37.914
AGENCY LINES AND SO THAT'S

00:53:37.981 --> 00:53:39.716
ANOTHER IMPETUS FOR THIS BILL SO

00:53:39.783 --> 00:53:40.884
JUST FOR EXAMPLE WERE BUILDING A

00:53:40.951 --> 00:53:42.185
PROJECT WAS THAT THE CITY WHAT

00:53:42.252 --> 00:53:43.820
OF SACRAMENTO TO BRIDGE --

00:53:43.887 --> 00:53:45.488
THAT WILL REPLACE THE OLD AYE

00:53:45.555 --> 00:53:47.891
STREET BRIDGE OF SO BLOODY

00:53:47.958 --> 00:53:48.358
PRIVATELY WITH THAT.

00:53:48.425 --> 00:53:50.193
THAT PROJECT IS BY ITS NATURE TO

00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:51.895
SEE PROJECT IT'S GONNA BE VERY

00:53:51.962 --> 00:53:54.164
EXPENSIVE TO MAINTAIN AND OUR A

00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:55.465
I'VE THE WILL HELP FINANCE IT IS

00:53:55.532 --> 00:53:57.067
IT LIKELY TO BE MAINTAINED AND

00:53:57.133 --> 00:53:58.301
OPERATED BY SOMETHING THAT MIGHT

00:53:58.368 --> 00:53:59.269
BE A GPA.

00:53:59.336 --> 00:54:00.904
THIS CONCEPT WOULD APPLY HERE IS

00:54:00.971 --> 00:54:02.038
THAT THE I'VE D. COULD ACTUALLY

00:54:02.105 --> 00:54:04.274

00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:14.317
LIFESPAN OF THE BRIDGE AND

00:54:14.384 --> 00:54:15.986
THAT'S A MUCH MORE RESPONSIBLE

00:54:16.052 --> 00:54:17.454
WAY OF BUDGETING FOR MAINTENANCE

00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:19.389
THAN RELYING ON ONGOING.

00:54:19.456 --> 00:54:20.290

THIS BILL WE ARE AT THE TABLE

00:55:39.235 --> 00:55:41.171
WHICH IS GOOD NEWS --

00:55:41.237 --> 00:55:42.572
MEMBERS IT'S BEEN STATED THAT

00:55:42.639 --> 00:55:44.240
THE INTENT OF THE PROPONENTS IS
