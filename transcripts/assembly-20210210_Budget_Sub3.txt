PLEASE NOTE THAT THE- BIG ZERO EMISSIONS VEHICLE PROPOSAL IN THE ENERGY COMMISSION BUDGET WILL BE CONSIDERED AT OUR MARCH SEVENTEENTH HEARING. NOT TODAY. ISSUE NUMBER ONE IS BROADBAND AND OUR FIRST PANEL IS TO CONSIDER HOW THE STATE CAN HELP BRIDGE GAPS IN BROADBAND ACCESS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THE PANDEMIC HAS MADE A BROADBAND CONNECTION. A BECAUSE IT ALWAYS WAS AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE FOR WORK EDUCATION AND EVEN GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE AND IT'S REALLY I THINK THE PANDEMIC HAS LAID OUT IN BROAD RELIEF FOR EVERYONE JUST HOW IMPORTANT THESE CONNECTIONS ARE. AND IT'S EXPOSED SERIOUS GAPS IN SERVICE PARTICULARLY FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. WHICH ONLY SERVES TO EXACERBATE MANY OTHER DISPARITIES LIKE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. EDUCATION AND JOB OPPORTUNITIES TO NAME JUST A FEW. SEVERAL OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE PUT FORWARD BILLS TO EXPAND BROADBAND WHICH IS WHY IT WAS ALSO INCLUDED AS A PRIORITY IN THE BUDGET BLUEPRINT THAT THE ASSEMBLY RELEASED IN DECEMBER. THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN WORKING ON A BROADBAND FOR ALL INITIATIVE. BUT THE BUDGET THUS FAR DOES NOT INCLUDE A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL IN THIS AREA SO TODAY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE OPTIONS THAT THE STATE COULD EXPLORE. TO EXPLORE EXPAND BROADBAND ACCESS. AND TO LOOK AT ANY OF THESE OPTIONS AND SEE IF THEY'RE NIMBLE ENOUGH TO ADDRESS THE URGENT NEEDS THAT MANY CALIFORNIANS. IN OUR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN OUR URBAN AREAS IN OUR RURAL AREAS THERE ARE SO MANY PLACES WHERE THIS NEED IS DIRE AND THAT- WE'VE BECOME. EVEN MORE AWARE OF DO THE PANDEMIC. SO WITH NO FURTHER ADO- WE HAVE- OUR PANEL TODAY IN THE FOLLOWING- ON THIS ISSUE IN THE FOLLOWING INDIVIDUALS. WILL PARTICIPATE VIRTUALLY IN THE DISCUSSION OF THIS ISSUE WHAT I'LL DO IS INTRODUCE THE PANEL THAT WILL TAKE ROLE BECAUSE I SEE WE HAVE A QUORUM HERE. OF OUR PANEL WILL CONSIST OF COMMISSIONER MARTHA GOOS MON A SEVENTH. FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION COMMISSIONER WITH THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. ROB OSBORNE WITH THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION ROSS BROWN OF THE L. A. O. AND- DAMIEN MEMNOCH AYMAN BANNED AND MARK MONROE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WHY DON'T WE TAKE ROLE AND THEN- WILL ASK THE PANEL TO BEGIN. HELLO HERE SENATE HERE FRIEDMAN MULLIN PATTERSON RIVAS. YOUR HAVE FUN GREAT- I'M NOT SEEING ANYBODY ON THE SCREEN THE TALK TALKING. FIFTY GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN RODRIGUEZ. GOOD MORNING THERE YOU ARE WELCOME. THANK YOU I THANK YOU CHAIRMAN WOMAN THANK YOU FOR HAVING A AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY MY NAME IS MARTHA BECAUSE MINE NOT SERVICE I AM ONE OF THE COMMISSIONERS AT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. I REALLY WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY AND DISCUSS SOME OF THE KEY CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE SEEN. OUR AS YOU MENTIONED NOT JUST RECENTLY BUT REALLY ACUTELY- THAT RIDLEY ARE- PROHIBITING US FROM ADVANCING ACCESS AFFORDABILITY. AND QUALITY BROADBAND SERVICE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AS YOU MENTIONED THE- DID INCLUDE AN OVERVIEW OF THESE KEY BARRIERS AND CHALLENGES. AND REALLY OUTLINED SOME OF THE STRATEGIES NEEDED TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON TO ACCOMPLISH BY GETTING OUT THESE ISSUES. PROTECTING CONSUMERS ATTAINING AFFORDABLE BROADBAND SERVICE ARE SOME OF THE KEYS BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE IS OBVIOUSLY A MAJOR AREA. AND REFORMING OUR STATE UNIVERSAL SERVICE PROGRAMS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY SUPPORTING OUR LOCAL AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS. AND I'M GONNA GET INTO A COUPLE OF RECOMMENDATIONS AT A BROAD LEVEL OF HOW WE HOPE TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON THIS. I WANT TO START WITH A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND AND- RECOGNIZE ALL THAT IS HAPPENING TODAY TO TRY TO GET OUT THIS ISSUE BUT UNFORTUNATELY TODAY. STILL ELEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIANS. WHO MAY HAVE ACCESS TO SOME FORM OF INFRASTRUCTURE COULD NOT AFFORD IT AT THE LEVEL THAT THEY NEED IT. ELEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION TODAY HAVE AN ACCESS ISSUE. ONE POINT SIX MILLION CALIFORNIANS DO SUBSCRIBE TO THE STATE'S LOW INCOME SUBSIDY PROGRAM KNOWN AS THE CALIFORNIA LIFELINE PROGRAM THAT I KNOW YOU WILL BE DISCUSSING FURTHER TODAY. THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT YET PROVIDE SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE BROADBAND NEEDS FOR TELEWORK TELEHEALTH AND DISTANCE LEARNING AND I'LL TOUCH ON THE IMPORTANCE OF REFORM IN THAT PROGRAM AND ENHANCING IT LATER ON. IN ADDITION THE STATE'S MAJOR ISPS AT&amp;T FRONTIER COMCAST **** AND CHARTER- ACCOUNT 495% OF THE STATE'S BROADBAND CONNECTIONS. EACH OFFER HELLO REDUCE COSTS PLAN HOWEVER CUMULATIVELY ALL OF THEM ONLY OFFER THOSE PLANS TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND SUBSCRIBERS SO THE GAP IS STILL HUGE. EVERY DAY THESE COMPANIES CONTINUE TO MAKE GREATER COMMITMENTS AND I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. THESE COMMITMENTS ARE UNENFORCEABLE. AND THEY CURRENTLY ARE NOT MEETING NEEDS ESPECIALLY OF ALL THE LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. IN NOVEMBER I ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE CONGRESSIONAL ACTION INCLUDED AN EMERGENCY BROADBAND BENEFIT THAT WOULD INCREASE AT THAT WOULD PROVIDE A SUBSIDY OF FIFTY DOLLARS A MONTH. BUT IT'S ONLY FOR A FEW MONTHS AT ALL YOU WANT TO RECOGNIZE IT DOES PROVIDE DOUBLE WHAT THE LIFELINE PROGRAM CURRENTLY DOES FOR THE VOICE AND VOICE SERVICES. IT'S ONLY A ONE TIME FUNDING PROGRAM. SO THERE'S POTENTIAL THERE BUT IT IS. JUST A SOMEWHAT OF A PILOT PROGRAM. IN ADDITION- CALIFORNIA DID RECEIVE SOME OF THE FEDERAL MONEY SIX HUNDRED NINETY FIVE MILLION OF THE FC'S RULES DIGITAL OPPORTUNITY FUN. BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE RECEIVED A HIGH AMOUNT OF LOW QUALITY PROJECTS THAT WILL LIKELY NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE THAT WE NEED NOW WE ARE WORKING ON MAKING THOSE- PROPOSALS AS BEST AS THEY CAN. BUT NOT WHAT WE WANTED TO SEE. SO WHY ARE THESE MEASURES WORKING. THE KEY HERE TO REALLY TAKE HOME IS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ENFORCEABLE. UNLIKE OTHER SERVICES WATER ELECTRICITY AND GAS UTILITY SERVICES BROADBAND SERVICE IS NOT REGULATED AS IN A SPECIAL SERVICE THAT IT IS. EITHER BY US AT THE STATE LEVEL NOR AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. THE MANNER IN WHICH HE READILY BROADBAND IS THE FOUNDATIONAL CHANGE THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO ATTAIN UNIVERSAL SERVICE RELIABLE SERVICE AND AFFORDABLE SERVICE. HISTORICALLY THE STATE DESIGNATED TELECOMMUNICATION PROVIDERS AS A SERVICE WITH THE SERVICE TERRITORY AND WE USED AND WE MANDATED THAT PROVIDERS SERVE EVERY HOUSEHOLD IN THEIR SERVICE TERRITORY THIS IS FOR THE VOICE SERVICE. THAT REQUIREMENT IS CALLED THE KERRIER OF LAST RESORT THAT'S HOW WE WERE ABLE TO MANDATE RELIABLE TELEPHONE SERVICE FOR ACCESS TO NINE ONE ONE FOR EVERY CALIFORNIAN FOR THE LAST CENTURY. THE STATE COUPLE THOSE REQUIRED FOR THOSE REQUIREMENTS ON THE CARRIERS WITH A SUBSIDY TO OFFSET THE COST TO EVERYONE. ESPECIALLY IN THOSE HIGH COST AREAS IN RURAL SPARSELY POPULATED DIFFICULT TO SERVE AREAS. THESE PROGRAMS STILL EXIST TODAY AND ARE CALLED THE HIGH COST FUND PROGRAMS THERE'S A NEED TO BE. HOWEVER THE V. FINE WHICH IS THE PRIMARY ONE ONLY SUBSIDIZES VOICE SERVICE AND OF COURSE I WILL TALK ABOUT HOW THAT FUND NEEDS TO BE UPDATED. WE ALSO SUBSIDIZE THE CARRIERS FOR PROVIDING A DISCOUNT TO LOW INCOME BOYS SERVICES OUT AS WE KNOW THROUGH THE LIFELINE PROGRAM AND THAT IS AGAIN A PROGRAM THAT NEEDS TO BE UPDATED FOR BROADBAND. THIS POLICY REGION CURRENTLY DOESN'T EXIST FOR BROADBAND INSTEAD WE HAVE AN UNREGULATED COMMUNICATIONS MARKET. WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO ESTABLISH THESE BASIC REQUIREMENTS ON ISPS THAT THEY SERVE EVERYONE AND THAT THEY PROVIDE AFFORDABLE SERVICE TO THE MOST VULNERABLE. WE SHOULD ALSO CONCURRENTLY ACKNOWLEDGE THESE ARE COSTS NEED TO BE OFFSET AND UPDATE OUR HIGH COST FUND IN OUR LIFELINE PROGRAM TO ASSIST IN COVERING THOSE COSTS. WHEN I TALK ABOUT A PARTICULAR ACT THAT'S RELEVANT FOR MAKING THESE CHANGES IN CALIFORNIA. THE DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND VIDEO COMMUNICATIONS ACT OF TWO THOUSAND SIX IT'S ALSO KNOWN AS DIFFICULT. IT WAS ONE OF THE KEY ACTS THAT DEREGULATED THE COMMUNICATIONS MARKET IN CALIFORNIA. HIGHER TO DISCUSS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS USE THEIR LICENSING AUTHORITY TO ENSURE THAT CARRIERS WERE PROVIDING QUALITY SERVICE AFFORDABLE OFFERINGS AND THAT THESE COMPANIES WERE SERVING THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY. DIFFICULT WAS REPLACED I REPLACED THIS LOCAL CONSTRUCT WITH A STATEWIDE STRUCTURE WHERE NOW THE PC PROVIDES A FRANCHISE LICENSE AND WE HAVE VERY LITTLE OVERSIGHT. THE NETWORK BUILD OUT AND LOW INCOME REQUIREMENTS FROM THE ACT HAVE NOT BEEN UPDATED IN TEN YEARS. THERE'S BEEN RECENT STUDIES BY U. S. C. GREEN LINING NDA AND OTHERS INCLUDING SOME OF OUR OWN THAT HAVE SHOWN THAT THIS HAS RESULTED IN REDLINING IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. THE ACT MAKES- OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT OF THESE ISSUES IMPOSSIBLE IT NEEDS TO BE UPDATED TO PROVIDE THE APPROPRIATE. OF MEASURES FOR SERVICE AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS. TODAY THERE HAS BEEN NO ENFORCEMENT ACTION UNDER THE ACT. I CAN TELL YOU PERSONALLY EVERY WEEK I RECEIVED NUMEROUS CALLS FROM COMMUNITIES COUNCILMEMBERS SUPERVISORS. COOPER ATTENDANCES SUPERINTENDENTS HAVE BEEN DOING INCREDIBLE WORK. THERE'S COMMUNITIES LIKE ON THE WEST SIDE OF FRESNO COMMUNICABLE VIOLA FOR THEIR SERVICE ON ONE SIDE HISTORY BUT NOT THE OTHER WE ALL HEARD OF THE YOUNG WOMEN IN SALINAS THE YOUNG CHILDREN IN SALINAS THAT LACKED ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE SERVICE. JUST YESTERDAY I RECEIVED A CALL A EMAIL FROM A MOBILE HOME PARK IN GILROY. WHOSE CABLE COMPANY WAS STARTING TO DISCONNECT THEM. NOT BECAUSE OF LACK OF PAYMENT BUT BECAUSE THEY NO LONGER WERE PAYING FOR THE VIDEO SERVICE. ALL OF THESE ISSUES THEY'RE ALL UNIQUE THEY ALL HAVE THE ABILITY TO. OF BE REMEDIED WITH SOME REGULATORY CONSTRUCT. AND BY THE WAY I WOULD SAY MOST NOT ALL THAT I WOULD SAY- YOU KNOW A LOT OF THESE ISSUES HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH A LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE. THEY HAVE TO DO WITH THE LACK OF REGULATION. SO THE ACT NEEDS TO BE UPDATED TO ENSURE THAT THE LARGEST INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE PROVIDING INTERNET SERVICES TO ALL NEIGHBORHOODS IN COMMUNITIES. AND AFFORDABLE PLANS TO LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. BY THE WAY WE'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE LOOKING OUT OUR CONSTRUCTS THE NEW YORK NEW YORK'S GOVERNOR GOVERNOR CUOMO JUST ANNOUNCED THAT HE WILL PROPOSE- A PERSON NATION REQUIREMENT THROUGH LEGISLATION REQUIRING ISPS TO OFFER AN AFFORDABLE FIFTEEN DOLLAR MONTH PLAN FOR HIGH SPEED INTERNET TO LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. OKAY SO I THINK YOU GOT THE MESSAGE ON THE NEED FOR REGULATION HERE- THE OTHER REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE TO THE PUZZLE IS INFRASTRUCTURE AND WE NEED TO CONSIDER OUR INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE HAS SOMETHING THAT IS CONTINUOUS AND WILL BE LIKE ANY OTHER OUR SYSTEM OF UTILITY SERVICE THAT NEEDS CONSTANT REINVESTMENT. M. BROADBAND IS NO DIFFERENT. HERE'S SOME OF THE NUMBERS FOR THE LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE THERE ARE STILL SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE NOT CONNECTED CALIFORNIA AND THAT IS THE LARGEST POPULATION THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN THE NATION UNFORTUNATELY. 33% A RURAL HOUSEHOLDS IN THE STATE HAVE NO HIGH SPEED BROADBAND. TRIBAL LANDS ARE VERY DEEPLY DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED WERE 24% OF THEIR HOMES ARE WITHOUT ACCESS. THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES FUND CSF IS THE MOST CRITICAL STATE INFRASTRUCTURE FUND AND WE REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO EXTENDING THAT PROGRAM IN MAKING IT EVEN MORE SUCCESSFUL. SINCE IT A TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN IT BEGAN THE PROGRAM HAS FUNDED SEVENTY SEVEN PROJECTS WHICH HAVE PROVIDED SERVICE TO THREE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS. TODAY WE ARE IN A CURRENT ROUND OF FUNDING ANY IS OVER SUBSCRIBED WE HAVE A TOTAL OF OVER FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF PROJECT REQUESTS AND WE HAVE A TO APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED MILLION REMAINING. WE'VE CONDUCTED AN INITIAL COST ASSESSMENT THAT DIRECTOR OSBORNE COULD GET INTO MUCH MORE DETAIL ON IT WHAT IF THERE'S INTERESTS. BUT THE COST RANGES FOR SERVING THE STATE ARE BETWEEN SIX TO SEVEN BILLION AND IT'S CLEAR THAT THE CURRENT CASF INFRASTRUCTURE FUND DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES FOR THAT. AND AGAIN WE WANT TO SEE THIS AS THE INJECTION OF FUNDING THAT IS NEEDED TODAY BUT IT WILL BE A CONTINUOUS NEED FOR REINVESTMENT. I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT SOME OF THE EXCELLENT ANALYSIS IN THE STAFF OUR OUR REPORT. AS YOU CONTINUE TO EXAMINE THE NEED FOR EXTENDING THE PROGRAM WE REALLY DO WANT TO REITERATE THE IMPORTANCE FOR BUILDING THE CAPACITY OF TRIBAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THEY HAVE SUCH A PIVOTAL ROLE TO PLAY IN CLOSING THIS DIVIDE. THERE IS A NEED FOR GREATER CAPACITY FUNDING FOR THOSE LOW- IN AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE SEEN UNFORTUNATELY THE PROGRAM'S HISTORY IS CHRONIC CHRONICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS I CAN'T FORGET TO MENTION COMMUNITIES LIKE LOST HILLS. NEVER GET AN APPLICATION BECAUSE THERE'S NOT REALLY A MARKET INCENTIVE FOR THEM T GET SERVICE OF THE CARRIERS DON'T COME IN WITH APPLICATIONS WE NEED THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS WOULD KNOW THESE AREAS ARE CHRONICALLY UNDERSERVED TO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO FINALLY APPLY. TO SERVE FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES. WE ALSO NEED TO ELIMINATE BARRIERS FOR EXPEDITING THESE- BUILDS THIS CONSTRUCTION BUILDS. BY ELIMINATING A PRACTICES THAT HAVEN'T HAPPENED IN PREVIOUS YEARS LIKE CARVE OUTS TO INCUMBENTS OR PROVIDING COMMENTS A RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL. THIS HASN'T WORKED IN THE LAST REAUTHORIZATION OF THE CASF PROGRAM THERE WAS BRITNEY SENSUALLY A CARVE OUT FOR FRONTIER NAY T. AND T. FOR TWO YEARS. AND EIGHTEEN T. NEVER APPLIED FOR ONE DOLLAR SO. AREAS LIKE JUST NORTH OF PARADISE NEVER WE'RE WAITING FOR TWO YEARS ASKING AT&amp;T MONTH. AFTER MONTH ARE YOU GONNA SERVICE OR NOT. AND THEY DO IT. SO PLEASE DON'T THAT AGAIN HI TO PROVIDE THAT SORT OF CONSTRUCT. AND FINALLY CONSIDER THAT THESE ARE THESE FUNDS AS I MENTIONED WILL BE NEEDED CONTINUOUSLY. I ALSO WANT TO BRING- THE FINAL ISSUE THAT WAS REALLY OUTLINED IN THE GOVERNOR'S- EIGHT PAGES WHICH IS THE IMPORTANCE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND REALLY TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE EXCITING MODELS THAT ARE OCCURRING BOTH IN OUR STATE AND THROUGHOUT THE NATION. BECAUSE ULTIMATELY BROADBAND IS A LOCAL ISSUE TRIBAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE THE ABILITY AND TOOLS TO BUILD BY KNOWING THE NEEDS BUT ALSO BY EXPEDITING PERMITTING AND USING THEIR PLANNING AUTHORITIES AND OTHER INCENTIVES THAT THEY CAN BUNDLE TOGETHER AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. IDEALLY THEY COULD ALSO BUILD THEIR OWN FOUNDATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT COULD BE USED TO BRING IN EVEN MORE COMPETITION. AS WE KNOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE MORE DRIVEN TO SEE SUCCESS IN THEIR ENTIRE COMMUNITIES TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY SERVICE AND THEY SEE THAT DIRECT CONNECTION WITH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS SOME. EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WE KNOW OF TODAY CORE FUNCTIONS EDUCATION HEALTH CARE. THERE'S MANY EXAMPLES BUT LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT A FEW IN UTAH THERE'S A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY CALLED UTAH TELECOMMUNICATIONS OPEN INFRASTRUCTURE AGENCY. OR UTOPIA. THEY BUILT AND THEN THERE CONTINUOUSLY BUILDING AN OPEN ACCESS FIBRE NETWORK THAT PROVIDE SERVICE TO ELEVEN CITIES. AND THEY DO SO WITH ACTUALLY A BONDING MECHANISM THAT PROVIDES THAT IS BASED ON VERY LITTLE A PUBLIC FINANCIAL SUPPORT THEY'RE ABLE TO USE THEIR REVENUE BASE. BUT THEIR MODEL ESSENTIALLY IS THAT THE PUBLIC HAS FUNDED THIS INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEN THE ALLOW CARRIERS TO COMPETE ON TOP OF IT FOR CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTS. MANY CITIES HAVE ALSO DEVELOP MASTER PLANS TO STREAMLINE THE PERMITTING OF FIVE G. SMALL CELLS AND FIBER OPTIC CABLES. THIS ENABLES SMART CITY SOLUTIONS SMART BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES SMART STREETLIGHTS INTELLIGENT TRAFFIC SIGNAL SYSTEMS SMALL CELLS AND PUBLIC WIFI. ALL OF THESE ARE MORE REASONS TO BUILD THE CAPACITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND FINALLY BUT NOT JUST LAST YEAR I WAS ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN A VIRTUAL RIBBON CUTTING OF THE SOUTH BAY CITIES CAPS COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS. FIBER NETWORK THE BAY BUILT ON THEY USED A COUPLE OF THE USED RACE COMMUNICATIONS IN AMERICAN DARK FIBER BUT- THEY COMPLETED A REGIONAL MUNICIPAL BROADBAND NETWORK THAT SERVES UP FOR FIFTEEN OF THE CITIES. IN THE LOS ANGELES SOUTH BAY REGION AND THEY HAVE OBVIOUSLY A VISION TO DO MORE WITH. SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME AND JUST IN SOME I WANT TO SAY THAT IT'S REALLY A CRITICAL TIME NOW FOR US TO TAX AND WE CAN ACTUALLY ACHIEVE SOME OF THESE GOALS I THINK THE GOVERNOR'S OUTLINED REALLY HITS ON THE TOP. TOP PRIORITIES THAT WE NEED TO ESTABLISH THESE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS BY ESTABLISHING REQUIREMENTS TO SERVE. REQUIREMENTS TO OFFER AFFORDABLE PLANS. WE NEED TO REFORM OUR LIFELINE AND HIGH COST PROGRAMS TO OFFSET THE COST OF PROVIDING THESE AFFORDABLE BROADBAND SERVICES. WE NEED TO EXTEND OUR INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING. AND WE NEED TO BUILD THE CAPACITY OF TRIBAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS AS WELL AS OUR DIRECTOR DIRECTOR ROB OSBORNE. WELL I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE VERY- DETAILED- A SUMMARY OF THE- THE GREAT NEED THAT EXISTS IN THE IN THE STATE TO HAVE BOTH ON. BOTH FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT- I THINK IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT- THESE ARE ALL AREAS THAT- WE NEED TO BE EXPLORING THAT- WHY DON'T DRIVE RATHER THAN GET INTO QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW I THINK. LET'S HEAR THE REST OF THE REPORTS AND FLUORIDE. SO WE'LL HEAR FROM- MR OSBORNE NEXT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I DIDN'T COME WITH ANY PREPARED STATEMENT SO I'M HAPPY TO YIELD MY TIME. OKAY- MISTER BROWN ARE YOU AVAILABLE TO THE L. A. I'LL HAVE A REPORT. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ROSS BROWN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE DON'T HAVE A LOT TO ADD AT THIS POINT OTHER THAN TO. REITERATE WHAT THE CHAIR MENTIONED THE GOVERNOR DOESN'T HAPPEN A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL ON% THIS RIGHT NOW WE UNDERSTAND THE- IMPORTANCE OF THE ISSUE AND WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOUR- COMMITTEE AND STAFF GOING FORWARD AS YOU EXPLORE THIS ISSUE FORWARD AND NOT GOING FORWARD AND- PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WHERE POSSIBLE. SO I HAVE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS SO. THANK YOU- AND- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. YEAH I AM AN ALBUM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- MINISTRATIONS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON BROADBAND- WITH OUTLANDER PRINCIPLES IN EIGHT PAGES- AND QUARTIER CONVERSATIONS COME. WELL OKAY THANK YOU SO LET ME- I BEGIN WITH YOU AND ASK YOU- THE FIRST QUESTION- WE APPRECIATE HAVING THE- THE EIGHT PAGE OUTLINE. OF BUT THAT REALLY DOESN'T HAVE ANY SPECIFICITY WITH RESPECT TO ACTUAL PROPOSALS AND I. HEAR THAT- WE CAN ANTICIPATE THAT THAT WILL BE PROVIDED TO US CAN YOU CONFIRM THAT AND CAN YOU CONFIRM THAT IT WILL BE BROUGHT TO US. OF IN TIME FOR US TO GIVE IT THE- NECESSARY REVIEW THAT- COMMITTEE STAFF FIVE- WILL WANT TO PROVIDE AN FOR A PUBLIC CONSIDERATION AT HEARING. I'M ON THE EIGHT PAGES I BELIEVE IT DOES PROVIDE SOME LEVEL OF DETAIL- WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK- TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TERMS OF THE SPECIFICITY OF IT YOUR REQUEST- WAIT. IT WOULD JUST BE GOING DOWN THROUGH EIGHT PAGES AND SHOWING KIND OF WHAT EACH ELEMENT REPRESENTS TERMS AND INITIATIONS PROPOSAL AND HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT TO YOUR STUFF. MISTER GOODMAN A SERVICE. I JUST PROVIDED US WITH A FAIRLY DETAILED SUMMARY OF VARIOUS AREAS- OF- WHERE- SHE THINKS CHANGES NEED TO BE MADE. ARE THESE THE THINGS THAT ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION BY THE ADMINISTRATION- YES THE- COMMISSIONER IS REPRESENTING- THE INTENTIONS OF THE ADMINISTRATION. AND THEN UP OF FINALLY. THE- OF WEEK WE CAN FIND FOR THE LONG TERM BUT I THINK OTHERS A GREAT INTEREST IN GETTING MOVING ON THIS ISSUE- QUICKLY SO ARE THERE SHOVEL READY PROJECTS THAT CAN BE. OF FUNDED IN THE NEAR TERM AS OPPOSED TO- SOME OF THE OTHER CHANGES LIKE REGULATORY CHANGES IT'LL PROBABLY TAKE SOME TIME. I BELIEVE SO- AGAIN ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT'S RISED IN THE GENDER IS THE ISSUE REVENUE COLLECTION IN THESE PROGRAMS. AB YOU GUYS REYES- THE IDEA OF BRINGING REPORT GENERAL FUND THAT'S A NEW PROPOSAL THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO I'M HAPPY TO BRING BACK TO THE MINISTRATION AND CONSULT WITH THAT I BELIEVE THERE ARE PROPOSALS THAT ARE READY TO GET OUT THE DOOR. THANK YOU- LET ME ASK MY COLLEAGUES SO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. THE THREE OF US- MS FRIEDMAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT- IF THE STATE WERE TO USE SOME OF ITS CASH ON HAND TO ACCELERATE THE DEPLOYMENT OF BROADBAND- WHAT METRICS WITH THE . YOU SEE USED TO ENSURE THAT DISADVANTAGED AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WERE COMPETITIVE. MISTER CHAIR WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO TAKE SOME. OF THE GREAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND IRONICALLY I'M I APOLOGIZE IF I MISSED PART OF THE QUESTION BUT MY INTERNET WAS COMING IN AND OUT- WE UNFORTUNATELY AS YOU KNOW- UNLIMITED WE HAVE A PROCESS WHERE WE DO TAKE AND- ALL OF THE CRITERIA THAT THE LEGISLATION HAS- DIRECTED US AND WE ABSOLUTELY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL A SCORING FOR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE LOW INCOME OF COURSE THE THRESHOLD ELIGIBILITY IS THAT THEY ARE NOT UNDER UNSERVED AREAS. AND I CAN I CANSAY JUST AS AN EXAMPLE SO LAST- OUR LAST ROUND OF- GRANT RECIPIENTS WERE A SET OF LOW INCOME PRIMARILY LOW INCOME MOBILE HOME PARKS IN THE GREATER A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AREA MANY OF THESE ARE PROJECTS THAT ARE KIND OF DONATED IT. THE LITTLE DOUGHNUTS OUTSIDE OF THE SERVICE AREAS OF MANY OF THE I. S. P.'S- SO ABSOLUTELY A PRIORITY I AND I REITERATE THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING THE CAPACITY BUILDING AS WELL BECAUSE- YOU KNOW SOME SOME OF THESE AREAS NEED TO BE DEVELOPED INTO APPLICATIONS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE SEEN THE IMPORTANCE OF PROVIDING THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO TRIBES M. AND WE CERTAINLY LIKE THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION OF EXPLORING EXPANDING. THAT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS WELL. THANK YOU WITH FRIEDMAN. YEAH THANKS I WANTED TO FIRST OF ALL THANK ARM THE COMMISSIONER FOR I'M OUTLINING NOT JUST AT THE NEED FOR FUNDING BUT THE NEED FOR FAR GREATER REGULATION TO ENSURE THAT FUNDS ARE GETTING TO THE PLACES WHERE THEY WERE INTENDED TO AND ALSO TO OUTLINE FOR US THE- I'D SAY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF SOME OF THE- THE STIPULATIONS ON THE LAST PROGRAMS IN TERMS OF STOPPING COMPETITION- PREVENTING SOME OF THE UTILITIES FROM. GIVING THEM TOO MUCH OF AN OUT TO NOT SPEND MONEY WHERE MONEY NEEDS TO BE SPENT AND ALSO THE- OF SOME COMMUNITIES BEING UNABLE TO APPLY FOR MONEY THAT'S ON THE TABLE. SO I'M GLAD THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS WORKING WITH YOU IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S A REAL OPPORTUNITY- TO APPROVE A LOT OF THOSE BARRIERS OUT TO CREATE THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT MONEY THAT TO PUT INTO THE PROGRAM IS ACTUALLY SPENT WHERE WE INTENDED. TO I AM NEW TO THIS PARTICULAR BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE BUT IT'S MY ASSUMPTION. BUT A LOT OF THOSE REGULATORY. GUARDRAILS ARE NOT SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT HERE BUT I DO HOPE THAT THAT MESSAGE GETS TO THE AUTHORS OF THE VARIOUS LEGISLATION THAT'S GOING TO BE INTRODUCED IN CERTAIN THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PRIORITISES YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE TO SHARE THEM WITH US. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT TO- BEFORE WE LEAVE THIS ISSUE- I HAVE A- A COMMENT AND A QUESTION ON A- ISSUE THAT'S NOT BEFORE US TODAY BUT- I WANTED TO RAISE AND I KNOW THAT- STAFF WILL NOT BE HERE- WHO WERE. ABLE TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION SO I HOPE THAT TO. YOU'LL TAKE IT UNDER ADVISEMENT AND TO RETURN- EITHER TO HEARING OR- SO I UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE. CERTAIN PROTOCOLS AND TIME LINES THAT WE NEED TO HEAR TO. IN OUR REGULATORY PROCESS AND THAT. ENERGY PROCEEDINGS IN PARTICULAR CAN BE. VERY COMPLICATED. WITHOUT QUESTION IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOT RUSH THROUGH THESE PROCEEDINGS. NOT ONLY FOR TRANSPARENCY PURPOSES BUT ALSO SO THAT WE IDENTIFY AND RESOLVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. HOWEVER A NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDERS- IN THE- ENERGY- AREA HAVE REACHED OUT TO ME ABOUT CONCERNS THAT MANY PROCEEDINGS ARE NOT GETTING COMPLETED IN WHAT THEY CONSIDER A TIMELY MANNER. AND ALL THESE DELAYS ARE IMPACTING OUR ABILITY TO ADDRESS RELIABILITY AND MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS. THERE WAS ALSO A RECENT ARTICLE IN THE LA TIMES THAT SUPPORTS. THIS NOTION AS WELL AS A LETTER THAT I AM IN POSSESSION OF THAT WAS RECENTLY SENT TO THE GOVERNOR BY A NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDERS THAT SHARES THIS SAME CONCERN SO MY QUESTION IS BASED ON WHAT I'M HEARING. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT WE ARE COMPLETING PROCEEDINGS IN A TIMELY MANNER- AND IF NOT THEN WHAT ARE THE FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THIS LACK OF PROGRESS ON PROCEEDINGS AND HOW CAN WE FIX THOSE ISSUES SO THE RULES CAN BE ADOPTED QUICKER IN A TIMELY FASHION TO ALLOW NECESSARY WORK TO GET DONE. WHETHER IT'S BUILDING OUT NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE PROMOTING INVESTMENT AND DEMAND RESPONSE STORAGE OR MICRO GRIDS OR AFFORDABLY PROCURING RESOURCES TO MEET RELIABILITY AND OTHER COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENT. I KNOW A AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THESE HEARINGS THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE THE APPROPRIATE STAFF HERE TODAY TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS. SO I'M ASKING OUR STAFF TO SEND MORE DETAILED QUESTIONS TO YOU REGARDING THESE CONCERNS AND- WILL AWAIT YOUR RESPONSE AND AFTER YOUR RESPONSE WE MAY WANT TO REVISIT THIS ISSUE IN A FUTURE HARRIS. OF THANK YOU FOR PATIENTLY LISTENING- TO THAT QUESTION AND I APPRECIATE- YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THE OF THE QUESTION. HUNTER A- WITH THAT WILL MOVE ON TO- UNLESS A- YOU WANT TO ADD SOMETHING GOTTA- MISS THIS IS A GOOD MAN A SERVICE. OF FOR A HEARTY CAL WEATHERMAN AND IN THIS SETTING WHETHER WHETHER YOU'RE WAITING TO SAY SOMETHING OR YOU'RE JUST PAYING. RAPT ATTENTION WHEN I'M SURE YOU ARE THE AUTHOR OF. NO I JUST I APPRECIATE THE INVITATION AND WE VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO FOLLOWING UP WITH YOU ON ON YOUR INVITATION TO WHO-TO ADDRESS ANY ISSUES THAT CAN HELP US BE MORE EXPEDITIOUS. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THAT AND CHAIRMAN IF I COULD JUST JUST MAKE ONE COLLEAGUES AS AS AS WE AND THIS AND THAT IS. THAT IF IT'S IF IT'S NOT. OBVIOUS TO MOST PEOPLE NOW THAT HIGH SPEED BROADBAND IS TRULY AN ESSENTIAL UTILITY JUST IMAGINE TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS FROM NOW- YOU KNOW LITERALLY YOUR STANDARD OF LIVING IT MAY BE VERY DIFFICULT EVEN MAINTAIN YOUR STANDARD OF LIVING WITHOUT IT AND SO. I THINK WE HAVE TO PROACTIVELY LOOK AT IT THAT WAY AND MAKE SURE WE TREATED JUST LIKE HAVING ELECTRICITY AND WATER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU'RE WELCOME BYE I WAS- LAUGHING TO MYSELF DURING THE PRESENTATION- WHEN NAVAS SAID A GOOD MINISTER OF US WAS REFERRING TO- THE- EXISTING. LAWS WERE TRULY FACILITATE VOICE COMMUNICATION AND I THOUGHT HOW MANY PEOPLE REALLY USE VOICE YOU KNOW HOW HOW HOW MANY TELEPHONE CALLS WE MAKE TODAY AS OPPOSED TO EVERY OTHER MEANS OF COMMUNICATION- THAT EXISTS IN THE OF MANY OTHER IMPORTANT USES THAT- WE PUT OUR DEVICES TO. AND THAT'S REALLY WHERE THE ISSUE IS TODAY- AND- THERE'S BEEN A DRAMATIC SHIFT AND- AND THE TECHNOLOGY THAT ALLOWS FOR SO MUCH MORE THAN- AT ONE TIME EXISTED. OUR SECOND ISSUE IS THE- ASSEMBLY MISCELLANEOUS- THREE MISCELLANEOUS BUDGET PROPOSALS THAT ARE. SUMMARIZED HERE AND THE- OF FOLLOWING GO INDIVIDUALS WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE DISCUSSION OF THIS ISSUE WE HAVE JONATHAN BLACK ROOTS WITH THE- CPC. AS WELL AS GEN CALIPHATE OF AND THE- THE L. A. O.

WE HELD A WORKSHOP AND HAVE RECEIVED NUMEROUS COMMENTS FROM STAKEHOLDERS BECOME A DEADLINE WAS LAST FRIDAY. WE'RE PREPARING RESPONSES TO THOSE COMMENTS AND WILL SOON PUBLISH UPDATED GUIDELINES BASED ON THOSE COMMENTS AND THEN WILL PRESENT OUR GUIDELINES CONSISTENT WITH THE DIRECTIVE OF THE STATUTE. TO OUR BOSSES AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION FOR ADOPTION IN MAY. THE SENATE AUTHORIZED UP TO FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM THIS MORNING WE SEEK THREE POINT SIX FIVE MILLION. SUPPORT TWENTY THREE STAFF AND THAT FIGURE INCLUDES ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND WE ALSO SEEK NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM A DIFFERENT FUND ARE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION FUNDS FOR A FRACTION OF P. Y. TO SUPPORT. THOSE OF PORTION OF THE LEGISLATION. L. CLOSE AARON INVITE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS. I'M SAYING NONE- IS THERE A REPORT FROM EITHER LMAO OR- FINANCE. APPLE THE APPLE FINANCE. MISTER CHARLES ROSS BROWN FROM THE LA- O. WE HAVE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS ON THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE I'M NOT SURE IF NOW WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO MAKE THOSE BUT I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT. GO RIGHT AHEAD. OKAY SO- BUT AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE- REQUESTED BUDGET PROPOSALS FROM THE COMMISSION. BECOMING COMMENTS ON UP ON THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES THAT LANGUAGE WAS RELEASED RELATIVELY RECENTLY SO WE'RE STILL. LOOKING AT IT AND WANT TO- YOU HAVE FURTHER CONNOR NUMBER SIX INFLICTED MINISTRATION. THANK WITH I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE PIECES OF IT ONE PIECE OF TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS. OPERATING AN EXEMPTION FOR THE EPIC PROGRAM FOR- SOME OF THE COMPETITIVE BID PROCESSES THAT- ENERGY COMMISSION IT USUALLY HAS TO GO THROUGH FOR SOME OF THOSE PROJECTS- AND WE THINK. THE EXEMPTION IN THIS CASE FOR A KIND OF FOLLOW UP FUNDING FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF TECHNOLOGIES AND PROJECTS MAKE SENSE TO HELP SPEED THAT. PROCESS ALONG AND HELP SUPPORT THOSE PROJECTS- WE DO THINK THE LETTERS THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER ADDING SOME. ADDITIONAL REPORTING LANGUAGE PERHAPS- A NOTIFICATION TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE FOR EXAMPLE. TO ENSURE SOME-TRANSPARENCY AROUND WHEN THAT- AUTHORITY IS EXERCISED SO THAT'S ONE. ISSUE TO CONSIDER I THINK THE OTHER ONE IS ON THE TWO OTHER PIECES ARE. REQUESTING CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION AUTHORITY FOR THE- NATURAL GAS FUNDING AS WELL AS THE SCHOOL ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAM. FUNDING AND- THAT- CAN REDUCE- AND IMPAIR LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OF FUNDING- BY TAKING IT OUT OF THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS AND PROVIDING CAN YOU. CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS SO IN OUR VIEW WE DO THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A VERY STRONG RATIONALE- TO PROVIDE THAT CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION AUTHORITY. AND AT THIS TIME IT'S NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR THAT OUT OF FORTY IS NEEDED TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT THOSE PROGRAMS SO. AGAIN AS YOU'RE JUST A NOTE SAID- WE THINK THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT THE COMMITTEE MIGHT WANT TO EXPLORE IN THE HEARING. AND WE PLAN ON HAVING FURTHER CONVERSATIONS AND WILL UPDATE THE COMMITTEE. AS WE EXPLORE THE ISSUE FURTHER. THANK YOU- SO- MISTER HAND- CAN YOU. THAT IS REGARD. CONTINUOUS A PRO. OF AVERSE- ANNUAL APPROPRIATION AND THE- THE VALUE OF ONE OVER THE OTHER DAY- AS YOU DO THAT IF THERE IF YOU COULD PROVIDE. OF A CONCRETE EXAMPLE OF HOW THE ANNUAL APPROPRIATION PROCESS. FOR EITHER OF THESE REVENUE STREAMS. OF AS HAS IT CAUSED A PROBLEM FOR THE PROGRAM. ARE THERE ANY EXAMPLES OF THAT. THANKS VERY MUCH- HERE AGAIN THROUGH BONE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE ENERGY COMMISSION- DRESS WITH YOUR PERMISSION BOTH OF THE ISSUES- THAT WAY- RAISED AND YOU YOU REYES FIRST THE CONTINUOUS PREPARATION AND THEN- ALL SPEAK ABOUT THE CONTINUOUS- THE FOLLOWING FUNDING. SO WITH REGARD TO THE CONTENDERS APPROPRIATION WE HAD A STROKE AND A LOT OF FUNDING FOR CLEAN ENERGY INVESTMENTS AND WE ARE REALLY PROUD OF OUR STEWARDSHIP OF THESE FUNDS. SOMETIMES PROJECTS DON'T SPEND ALL THE MONEY THAT WAS AWARDED AND WE THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING BECAUSE- IT WHEN YOU FUND THE PROJECT THERE ARE THERE'S A BIT OF ESTIMATION THAT GOES ON AND WE- A VERY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE MANNER IN WHICH OUR AWARDEES. SPEND THE FUNDS. AND SOMETIMES THEY UNDERSTOOD. AND WE THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING SO WHEN THEY UNDERSTAND FUNDS THOSE FUNDS REFER TO THAT THE FUND ITSELF AND IN THIS CASE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PURE NATURAL GAS FUND. AND THEN WE REQUIRED THROUGH THE P. YOU SEE. TO SUBMIT A SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN TO SPEND THOSE FUNDS AND THAT WOULDN'T CHANGE UNDER OUR PROPOSAL. HOWEVER ONCE APPROVED BY THE P. YOU SEE THE LAW REQUIRES TO COME BACK TO SEEK PASSED THE CREDT REPORTING THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEKING TO GET THE CAN AS A CORPORATION FOR. AND TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION CHAIR DIRECTLY. UP YET TO CONCLUDE THAT DELAYS SO FUNDS MAY FALL OUT- SOON AFTER A BUDGET IS APPROVED THE TIMING OF ANY GIVEN GRANT. JERRY SAID SO WE'VE HAD THE SITUATION WHERE FUNDS WILL FALL OUT LET'S SAY IN JULY OF A GIVEN YOUR JULY OR AUGUST. WE'D LIKE PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE ECONOMIC CHALLENGES AND WANTED TO GET FUNDS OUT INTO THE- INTO OUR COMMUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO TURN AROUND AND VERY QUICKLY- WE APPROPRIATE THE- LEAST WE UNCOVER THOSE FUNDS THROUGH NEW SOLICITATIONS. SO WITH THE DELAY WE HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT BUDGET CYCLE COULD BE UP TO UP TO A YEAR JUST SHY OF THE YEAR AND THE EXAMPLE I GAVE AND WE HAVE HAD THAT. HAPPEN JUST GIVE ME A QUICK SENSE A CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF WHAT'S HAPPENED THE PAST FIVE YEARS WE'VE COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE. A NUMBER OF TIMES IN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN WE DID SO FOR THREE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS- FALL YEAR FOR. JUST UNDER SIX MILLION AND THEN IN NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR EIGHT MILLION AND SO- AGAIN IT WOULD JUST PROVIDE- A SET UP SOME FLEXIBILITY. THESE FUNDS HAVE ALREADY GONE THROUGH AN EXTENSIVE VETTING PROCESS THROUGH THE- PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND WE PROVIDE ANNUAL REPORTS. TO YOU ABOUT HOW THOSE FUNDS WHICH THAT. I DON'T STOP THERE BUT WOULD LIKE TO THE CA. APPROPRIATE COMMITTEE. THE- STOLEN FROM IF YOU WOULD WISH TO HEAR ABOUT THE- THAT'S FIVE ONE TO GO AHEAD AND DO THAT. OKAY WITH RESPECT TO THAT LAST BUDGET CYCLE WE WORK WE PROPOSED IN. THE LEGISLATURE AGREED TO PROVIDE THIS FALL ONE FUNDING OPPORTUNITY THIS WAS WITH RESPECT TO OUR EPIC PROGRAM SO I JUST WAS TALKING ABOUT NATURAL GAS WHICH IS ALSO FROM OUR RESEARCH DIVISION THESE ARE ALL RESEARCH FUNDS. THIS IS EPIC WHICH IS ELECTRICITY FUNDS. NEARLY ALL THE FUNDING THAT WE AWARD THROUGH AFFECT. IS COMPETITIVELY BID AND WE AIM TO KEEP IT THAT WAY. HOWEVER OUR PROCESS IS THOUGHTFUL AND DELIBERATE IT COULD TAKE A YEAR OR SOMEONE WE CAN SEE THAT IDEA AND WORKSHOPS ON A PARTICULAR TOPIC TO THE AND PASSPORT ULTIMATELY AWARDING THE FUNDS. LAST YEAR THE BILL WAS SB. ONE FIFTEEN IT GRANTED A SECURITY. TO PROVIDE FOLLOWING FUNDING FOR AMERICORPS PRICE BUT ONLY UNDER REALLY. CONDITIONS I WON'T GO THROUGH ALL THE JUST TO RATTLE OFF QUICKLY- WE CAN ONLY DO FOLLOW ON FUNDING THE PRIME RECIPIENT IS IN CALIFORNIA. WHEN 80% OR MORE OF THE FUNDS WILL BE SPENT IN CALIFORNIA WHEN THE ORIGINAL PROJECT HAD TO BE COMPETITIVELY BID. UP THERE'S SOLID RESULTS FROM THE PROJECT THERE'S- BREAKTHROUGH POTENTIAL- WHAT THE PARTIES HAVE TO BE SOME OF THE NEAR TERM- PARTIES LIKE WILDFIRES. AND WE HAVE TO MAKE A JUDGMENT ABSENT FOLLOW ON FUNDING A PROJECT THAT'S DOING REALLY WELL MIGHT SCALE BECAUSE THESE ARE PROJECTS THAT ARE HIGH RISK AND THEY SOMETIMES HAVE DIFFICULT DIFFICULTY ATTRACTING- CAPITAL. TO THE POINT ROSS ARE MADE FROM THE L. A. O. THE SIXTY DAYS. WE THINK THAT'S- WE RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THAT APPROACH BECAUSE AS WE SPEAK WE'VE GOT- FIVE OR SIX OR SEVEN PROJECTS THAT WE'RE CONTEMPLATING FOR FOLLOW ON FUNDING FROM THE AUTHORITY RECEIVED SOME MONTHS. AGO IT TOOK US AWHILE TO. PUTTING THE RULES OF TAKE AND UP WITH PROCESS QUICK SOME THAT ARE TO GO. A COUPLE OF THEM COULD BE IN PLACE BY SUMMER AND ARE DIRECTED TOWARD HELPING RELIEVE ARE- CHALLENGES WE'VE HAD ON THE GRITS OF THE TIGHTENING. THAT IT COULD BE VERY VERYGOOD AND IF WE ADD THE SIXTY DAY. THE SECURITIES AND IT COULD JUST PROVIDED THE LACK. THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER- ASK OUR STAFF TO TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION AS WE CONTINUE OUR EVALUATION OF- OF THESE OF BUDGET REQUESTS.

THE CLIENT EMAIL LIVE STREAM- IT REALLY LIMITS THE CONNECTION TO THE COMMUNITY- UNLESS YOU ARE ACTUALLY ORGANIZATION ORGANIZER AND THERE'S A DIRECT CONNECTION THE COMMUNITY- TO SOMEONE WHO CAN- NAVIGATE THE ONLINE SYSTEM AND- THE PUBLIC PROCESS.

AND I THINK IT TAKING BIRD THOSE OF US WITH BROADBAND TO FORGET BOOK OF JUST HOW MUCH OF OUR LIVES I TAKE PLACE ONLINE SO. I THINK THEY'RE KEEPING THAT THE STATE- AND COUNTY ARE WORKING TOGETHER CAN DO ABOUT IT ONE IS THAT THE FACT IS URGING THE LEGISLATURE EXTENDED MINISTRATION TO IMMEDIATELY IMPLEMENT THE BROADBAND CALL ACTION PLAN THAT WAS ADOPTED BY THE BROADBAND COUNCIL IN DECEMBER WE ENDORSE IT. IN ITS ENTIRETY AND WE THINK THERE ARE SEVERAL CASES OF IT IF THEY'RE IMPLEMENTED IMMEDIATELY THEY CAN HELP ANY MONEY THAT THAT COMES TO WHETHER IT'S THE TSF PROGRAM THE COMMISSION OF THE MINUTES OF ITS WITH TALKING ABOUT WHETHER DID YOU FEDERAL MONEY TO COME DOWN BUT THERE CAN YOU NEW STATE MONEY TO HOPE THAT HE WOULD BE STAFF MONEY MORE EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY FORGET SOME OF THOSE THINGS GOING. QUICKLY THE OTHER THING THAT WE WOULD URGE THAT THE LEGISLATURE TO DO- EVEN AS PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS HUNDRED XCELERATED TIMELINE IS THE PASSAGE OF EIGHTY FORTUNATE SB FOUR- I KNOW THEY'RE NOT.

OUR FINAL COMMENT IN Q. WAS LYING TWENTY TWO TWO TWO THE LINE IS OPEN. GOOD MORNING KAREN MEMBERS THIS IS PAMELA LOPEZ WITH KEITH STREET CONSULTING ON BEHALF OF TRUE CONNECT A CALIFORNIA LIFELINE PROVIDER. WE ECHO THE CONCERNS OF CARE PERSON BLOOM WITH REGARD TO OUR OVERALL LIFELINE PARTICIPATION RATE THINKING COULD BE COPYING OR WHETHER IN THE WAY- IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IN LIGHT OF THE- STATE PANDEMIC AND ECONOMIC CRISIS BEING FACED BY SO MANY FAMILIES. THAT OVERALL NEED AND DEMAND FOR THE CALIFORNIA LIFELINE PROGRAM WOULD BE WOULD BE DOWN AND YET THE LIFELINE B. C. P. DATA IN THE LIFELINE BCPS SUBMITTED BY THE CPUC SHOWS THAT PEOPLE ARE DROPPING OFF THE PROGRAM AT THE AVERAGE. CHURN RATE THAT THEY'VE ALWAYS DROPPED OFF BUT THAT YOU CALIFORNIANS ARE NOT FINDING NOT- WE ALSO SUBMITTED DATA TO A CHAIR PERSON BLOOM AND ALL OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS- WHICH SHOWED BACK UP ROUGHLY ABOUT 10215% OF. INDIVIDUALS IN EACH OF THE DISTRICTS OF EACH OF THE MEMBERS ON THE COMMITTEE. THAT ACTUALLY QUALIFY FOR THE LIFELINE PROGRAM ARE IN BOLD AT BROADBAND AND CONNECTIVITY ARE AN IMPORTANT. PART OF MAKING SURE THAT CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO OUR PHONE AND INTERNET UT ACTUALLY MAKING SURE THAT LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS HAVE A PHONE IN THEIR HAND AND THAT THAT PHONE HAS ACCESS TO DATA. THAT THEY CAN USE IS ANOTHER CRITICAL PIECE OF THE PUZZLE WE WOULD ALSO SUGGEST THAT IN PREVIOUS YEARS LIFELINE PROVIDERS HAD DONE A GOOD JOB OF OUR INVOLVEMENT AND OUTREACH EFFORTS AT THAT THE WAY THAT- REIMBURSEMENT HOT STOCKCHARTS THE LIFELINE PROVIDER HAVE BEEN ALTERED IN RECENT YEARS. HAS CREATED DISINCENTIVES FOR LIFELINE PROVIDERS THEMSELVES TO CONTINUE DOING THAT WORK AND THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE MAJOR BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT LIKE FIND INVOLVEMENT IS DOWN. WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER THE- SURPLUS THAT WILL ULTIMATELY. BE AVAILABLE IN THE EARMARKED FOR BY BUDGET AFTER THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR LOAN REPAID. TO LOOK AT OPTIONS FOR. LIFELINE PER. IN REVENGE. AND REDOING THEIR AT UP AFTER IT. IT'S NICE TO WAIT FOR A STUDY FROM- STOCKS. I COULD COME IN I AT THE VERY END THIS YEAR BUT A WHOLE YEAR GONE BY ISSUE TO WAIT TO. THAT BUT THE FACT WE'RE NOT AND I SIX. RIGHT NOW. AND WORKING WITH.
