WE DID -- WE DO HAVE SOLID FINANCIAL RESERVES A WE ADOPTED A A TEN YEAR. SCHOOL STATE ABILITY PLAN LAST YEAR UP TO DEAL WITH ITS HAZARDS HOWEVER BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A STRONG A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT THEY WILL USE UP OUR OUR OUR RESERVES IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING SOON IN TERMS OF OF STEPS AND THIS -- AB SIX EIGHTEEN WILL HELP US SOLVE THAT PROBLEM AS AS ONE OPTION AS A THE SUMMER ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE REVIEW BY STANDARD AND POOR'S -- AND THEY REAFFIRMED ARE VERY STRONG DOUBLE A MINUS BOND RATING -- AND THEY AND AND THAT WAS PARTLY DUE TO OUR OUR RESERVES ARE SOME RESERVES ARE STRONG MANAGEMENT.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND THANK YOU TO SO MANY OF OUR STONE FOR A BRING FORTH THIS BILL. ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION YES MA'AM FOR MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON DAVID WOLF THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION OPPOSED TO YOU -- A. B. SIX ONE EIGHT HERE TODAY. AND MEMBERS JUST BE COR AGAIN WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE AS BOTH THE AUTHOR AND THE WITNESS ALLUDED. TO IS AN AUTHORIZATION OF ATTACKS THIS DOES STORE CHOIR VOTER APPROVAL FROM THE CITIZENS OF SCOTT VALLEY SCOTTS VALLEY AND OF COURSE WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT YET MEMBERS WE DO OPPOSE THIS TAX AUTHORIZATION BILL AS WE'VE OPPOSE ALL SORTS OF OTHER TAX AUTHORIZATION BELLS CERTAINLY IN THE TWELVE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN AT HOWARD JARVIS -- FOR THE SIMPLE REASON SALES TAX INCREASES EVEN THE QUARTER CENT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE ARE INCREDIBLY REGRESSIVE. AND YOU KNOW ADDS TO THE BURDEN THAT INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYERS PAY CALIFORNIA OBVIOUSLY HAS THE HIGHEST SALES TAX IN THE NATION BY FAR IN THE CITY OF SCOTTS VALLEY ALREADY HAS A SALES TAX INCREASE. RATE OF 9% AND TO PUT THAT FIGURE IN PERSPECTIVE THAT TAX RATE IS ALREADY IN THE TOP 20%. OF THE SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY FIVE LOCAL CALIFORNIA JURISDICTIONS THAT LEVY SALES TAXES SO SCOTTS VALLEY ALREADY HAS. A SALES TAX THAT CERTAINLY HIGHER THAN THE STATE AVERAGE IN A THINK ADDING TO THAT -- EVEN THOUGH THE REASONS MAY WELL BE THE ALLIED IS INAPPROPRIATE I WOULD ALSO SAY TO MEMBERS JUST IN CLOSING THE BRADLEY BURNS SALES TAX ACT HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY SIX AND WHAT THAT DID WAS SET A UNIFORM SALES TAX RATE. OF 2% ACROSS ALL MUNICIPALITIES WE DO THINK THIS IS A FAIR SALES TAX RATE IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR DECADES -- IT'S INAPPROPRIATE TO EXCEED THE RATE I MEAN AGAIN IT'S BEEN AROUND FIFTY YEARS WHY DO WE NEED TO EXCEED THEIR EIGHT YET WE SEE ALSO ITS MUNICIPALITIES DOING THIS. AND IN FACT THE REASON WHY THIS BILL NEEDS TO COME BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE TODAY IS BECAUSE WE'RE EXCEEDING THAT BRADLEY BURNS 2% RATE -- DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS WOULD ASK FOR AN OF A ADDITIONAL IN THIS IS IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NINE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE START WORK. YEAH I THINK LOCAL FOLKS SHOULD BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHAT THEIR TAX RATES GOING TO BE AND I'D BE IN FAVOR OF JUST ALLOWING IT NO CITIES THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS SAYING NINE A SUMMER STONE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU IT'S INTERESTING TO HEAR THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION TALK ABOUT REGRESSIVE TAXES WENT. REALLY WE'VE LEFT VERY FEW LEVERS FOR CITIES LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THEIR REVENUE NEEDS. A VERY EFFECTIVE CITY LIKE SCOTTS VALLEY VERY FISCALLY PRUDENT CITY LIKES LIKES CUTS BELLY IS REALLY RUNNING OUT OF OPTIONS BECAUSE OF THE INEQUITIES OF THE PROPERTY TAX SYSTEM. AND THE THE LACK OF BALANCE THERE IN FACT THE 9% RATE IF WE ACTUALLY APPLIED SALES AND USE TAX. EQUITABLY ACROSS THE ECONOMY WE WOULD BE TAXING SERVICES A COULD SIGNIFICANTLY DROPPED THE RIGHT SO TO BE FOCUSING ON A 9% RATE WHEN WHAT WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON IS THE BASE OF A WHICH THAT IS APPLIED. AND THE INEQUITIES IN THE PROPERTY TAX SYSTEM. WE OTHERWISE LEAVE. CITIES WITH NO OTHER CHOICES BUT TO COME TO US. AND AMEND A BILL THAT IS SIXTY YEARS OLD AND IN THE MEANTIME THE MUCH TAX POLICY HAS IN FACT CHANGED SO NOT ONLY IS THIS JUST THE BY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE ALLOWED. ACROSS CALIFORNIA FOR CITIES WAR WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN A MORE HONEST WAY IS IS TAX REFORM AND LOOK AT HOW REVENUES ARE COLLECTED AND REVENUES ARE ADJUSTED IN THE MEANTIME WE HAVE REALLY NO OTHER CHOICE BEFORE US. BUT THE LET FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE CITIES DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO I THEREFORE ASK FOR YOUR HIGH ABOUT. THANK YOU AND OUR RECOMMENDATION IS TO PASS TO THE FLOOR WHEN WE HAVE A QUORUM WILL TAKE IT UP FOR A VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MOVING TO FILE ITEM THIRTEEN CERVANTES ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME UP. AND THIS IS FOR TESTIMONY ONLY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY RANKS FIFTH LARGEST IN THE WORLD THIS PROSPERITY HAS BY PASSED SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ROUTINELY FACE SYSTEMIC BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT. AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY SIX ESTABLISHES THE CALIFORNIA WORK OPPORTUNITY TAX CREDIT AS AN INCENTIVE FOR EMPLOYERS TO HIRE INDIVIDUALS FROM CERTAIN TARGETED POPULATIONS INCLUDING AN UNEMPLOYED VETERANS. INDIVIDUALS RECEIVING PUBLIC ASSISTANCE INDIVIDUALS WITH THE DISABILITY AND THE FORMALLY INCARCERATED THE CALIFORNIA WATCHED SEEM BUILDS UPON THE FEDERAL WATCH HE PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES FOR THIRD PARTY VERIFICATION OF EMPLOYEE A LEGIBILITY. ACCORDING TO THE WAR IN BUSINESS SCHOOL STUDY CALIFORNIA SAVES OVER A HUNDRED AND EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARDS TÃ¢M SNAPPED SNAPPED AND MEDICAID EACH YEAR AS A RESULT OF THE FEDERAL WATCHED SEE. BY ADOPTING A STATE WHAT SEE CALIFORNIA FURTHERS ITS GOAL I THINK OF AN INCLUSIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH BY SISSY INDIVIDUALS WITH BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT MOVE FROM WELFARE TO WORK WITH ME TO TESTIFY OR NUMBER OF SUPPORTERS. I WHICH ONE PRODUCE THEMSELVES TODAY. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS COULD SPECULATE ON BEHALF OF COUNTY AND WE THINK THE AUTHOR. FOR OFFERING THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE WE WORKED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION YEARS AGO ON THE ELIMINATION OF THE EASY PROGRAM IN THE CREATION OF AMONGST OTHER PROVISIONS THE NEW EMPLOYMENT CREDIT AND UNFORTUNATELY AS YOUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. EXPLAINS HAS BEEN VASTLY UNDER UTILIZED INSTEAD OF PROVIDING. SIXTY OR SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY AND BENEFIT TAX BENEFIT IT'S LESS THAN A MILLION DOLLARS. SO WE STARTED LOOKING AT WHAT ARE ALTERNATIVES AND THE FEDERAL WATCH C. WAS ESTABLISHED IN. NINETEEN NINETY SIX AND HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE EVER SINCE AND IS IT TARGETED AT INDIVIDUAL SIMILAR TO THE ANY SEE WITHOUT THOSE LIMITATIONS. AND THE OTHER BENEFIT IS THAT IT BUILDS OFF OF AND UTILIZES THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGH THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT ET DE WHICH GOES THROUGH THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS SO WE THINK THAT. A STATE WHAT SEE IS A FAR BETTER ALTERNATIVE TO TAKE AND I WOULD ALSO NOTE MADAM CHAIR THAT THE BILL COMPLIES WITH BOTH. OF THE COMMITTEE REQUIREMENTS A SUNSET DATE AS WELL AS THE EVALUATION METRICS THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THAT I MEAN A LOT TO BENSON AND I REPRESENT THE NATIONAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY NETWORK. IT'S A NETWORK MADE UP OF A PROFESSIONAL TAX PREPARERS CPA'S AND PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR SITE SELECTION FOR COMPANIES THAT ARE LOOKING TO EITHER MOVE OR CHANGE LOCATION -- WE COVET TO THOSE WHO DO LOOK AT CALIFORNIA AS A SITE BECAUSE THAT'S TYPICALLY NOT WHAT HAPPENS. SO THEY LOOK AT OBVIOUSLY THINGS THAT WOULD BRING PEOPLE TO CALIFORNIA AND CREATE AN ALL ON OPPORTUNITY IN AN INCENTIVE FOR BUSINESS. THIS IS A BUSINESS INCENTIVE CREATING THE WORK OPPORTUNITY TAX CREDIT IN CALIFORNIA TO MOVE WITH ALONG WITH THE FEDERAL WORKING ALONG WITH THE FEDERAL WHAT SEE -- BUT IT IS ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE WITH BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO DON'T TYPICALLY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRULY -- FIND THE JOBS AND WE ARE. LOOKING -- TO TO TO EXTEND WHAT THE FEDERAL WHAT'S HE DOES THIS ALSO CREATES CREATES A RETENTION SO THAT THE EMPLOYEES STAYS WITH THE EMPLOYER LONGER THERE'S THAT THAT'S BUILT INTO THE CALIFORNIA WANT SEE. WE THINK FOR THOSE THINGS THE EXISTING FEDERAL WATCH SEE AN ADDING THAT CALIFORNIA ONCE HE WOULD BE A BETTER HIRING CREDIT THAN WE HAVE TODAY. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. YOU CAN ALSO ORDER A MAP OF THE HUNDRED THOUGH ALSO [inaudible] YEAH QUESTION. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IS. THANK YOU WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE DOT QUIRK -- SO WITHIN THE ANALYSIS SECTION DE UNDER COMMENTS. OF THIS QUESTION ABOUT EFFECTIVENESS AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO GIVE ME -- A LONG ANSWER TODAY BUT BEFORE WE VOTE ON THIS -- IF YOU CAN -- PERHAPS SEND ME AND OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- SOME INFORMATION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM SURE. MADAM CHAIRMAN I RESPOND BRIEFLY. DOCTOR QUIRK -- JUST A COUPLE OF ITEMS I KNOW THAT. THE ANALYSIS CITED SOME EARLIER STUDIES FROM -- TWO THOUSAND ONE TWO I THINK THE AUTHOR HAS CITED THE TWENTY FOURTEEN WHARTON SCHOOL -- IT HAS BEEN STUDIED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL QUITE EXTENSIVELY SINCE ITS ENACTMENT IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX BUT WILL PROVIDE GREATER DETAIL TO YOU ON THOSE ADDITIONAL STUDIES. YEAH WE DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH IT ALL TODAY BUT I'D LOVE TO SEE IT THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS SEEING NONE SEVEN OR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU THIS ITEM FOR TESTIMONY ONLY BUT WHEN IT'S READY TO COME MOVING TO FILE ITEM SIX ELEVEN TWENTY ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUNNINGHAM. THIS IS FOR TESTIMONY ONLY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB. ELEVEN TWENTY AS YOU ALL KNOW CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO A BOOMING CRAFT DISTILLER INDUSTRY IT'S ESTIMATED THERE THAT THERE ARE OVER ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY CRAFTED STORIES IN CALIFORNIA TODAY. AND THIS NUMBER IS GROWING RAPIDLY. CURRENT TAX REGULATIONS ALLOW FOR A SALES TAX EXEMPTION FOR OAK BARRELS USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF BRANDY OR WINE. THIS EXEMPTION DOES NOT HOWEVER APPLY TO OAK BARRELS USED FOR DISTILLED SPIRITS. AB ELEVEN TWENTY WOULD SIMPLY ADD OAK BARRELS TO THE SALES EXEMPTION ON A LIMITED FIVE YEAR SUNSET BASIS. WITH ME TO MY RIGHT IS MY FRIEND ALEX BILL KANA HE'S A DISTILLER MY DISTRICT IN THESE HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. COMMITTEE MEMBERS MAY HAVE. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR AT FIRST TAKE TAKING A LOOK AT THIS BILL -- I'VE BEEN A DISTILLER AND A WINE MAKER AND THAT THE PASTOR WAS REGION FOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS. ORIGINALLY WHEN I STARTED MAKING WINE BARRELS WERE TAXED AND THEY WEREN'T LOOKED AT AS AN INGREDIENT THEY WERE LOOKED AT AS A STORAGE CONTAINER. AND THE REALITY IS OAK BARRELS ARE HORRIBLE STORAGE CONTAINERS BECAUSE THEY LEAK BUGS EAT THEM THEY GO BAD. I STAINLESS STEEL IS A MUCH BETTER OPTION. AND SO IT WAS CLARIFIED A NUMBER OF YEARS BACK THAT WINE WAS ACTUALLY AN INGREDIENT EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S OKEY CHARDONNAY IS WONDERFUL CABERNET'S. IT IS A FLAVOR PROFILE THAT ADDS. THAT CHARACTERISTIC TO THE WIND THAT CONSUMERS LIKE. I'M. WHEN THE BILL WAS ART WHEN THE RULES WERE ESTABLISHED THERE WAS NO DISTILLING INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA SPEAK UP -- I HAVE ABOUT EIGHT YEARS AGO WE STARTED OUR DISTILLERY IMPASSE ROBLES THEY WERE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY DISTILLERS IN THE STATE AT THE TIME -- SO THE RULES REALLY HADN'T LOOKED AT SPIRITS BARRELS -- ACTUALLY IN SPIRITS IT IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT TO PUT THEM IN OAK BARRELS BECAUSE WHEN I SPIRITS I COME OFF THE STILL THERE ACTUALLY CLEAR AND DON'T HAVE A LOT OF FLAVOR. AND SO THE OAK BARREL WILL ACTUALLY IN PART NOT ONLY THE COLOR BUT A LOT OF THE FLAVORS THAT MOST CONSUMERS I EXPECT FROM THERE FOR THE FROM THEIR AGE SPIRITS. I'M SURE WE LOOK AT AN OAK BARREL AS AN INGREDIENT I'M NOT AS A STORAGE CONTAINER AND ALL WE'RE ASKING FOR IS THAT THE BARRELS FOR SPIRITS PRODUCTION OUR LOOK AT THE SAME AS THEY ARE FOR WINE. AND AT THE END OF THE CYCLE WILL BE TAXED ON THE PRODUCT THAT COMES OUT OF THOSE BARRELS WILL BE SOLD TO THE CONSUMER AND TAXED. SO THE SALES TAX IS GETTING A PICKED UP BUT IT JUST AT A LATER. DATE AND TIME -- I WOULD APPRECIATE SUPPORT AT ON THIS BILL JUST SO THAT SMALL DISTILLERS LIKE MYSELF -- WHO HAVE SMALL FAMILY BUSINESSES HAVE CLARITY OF THE RULES SO WE KNOW HOW TO PLAN FOR THE FUTURE? I'M I APPRECIATE ALL YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS. THANK YOU DISTILLNG THIS IS IN SUPPORT. WHEN MRS IN OPPOSITION? THING NINE COMMENTS QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE DOCTOR BURKE. TOM.

I SEE I'M STILL ON AND FLOOR SESSION THAT'S FROM I HAVE THAT RIGHT NOW -- THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE A TAX CREDIT FOR BUSINESSES THAT PURCHASE COMPOSABLE CUTLERY FOR CAN -- CUSTOMERS USE AT THEIR PLACE OF BUSINESS THIS MEASURE ENCOURAGES THE FOOD INDUSTRY TO MOVE AWAY FROM SINGLE USE PLASTIC CUTLERY INTO INSTEAD OPT FOR COMPOSABLE OPTIONS I THINK ALL OF US ARE WHERE. IN THE LEGISLATURE -- HOW DEVASTATING SINGLE USE PLASTIC SUCH AS CUTLERY -- REALLY IS TO OUR ENVIRONMENT SO WHAT THE POINT OF THIS BILL IS TO JUST PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE TO BUSINESS RATHER THAN BANNING THINGS LIKE SINGLE USE PLASTIC. THE PROVIDES AN INCENTIVE THAT BUSINESSES COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FOR SWITCHING FROM COMPULSIVE TO A OF FROM A SINGLE USE PLASTIC OPTION TO A COMBUSTIBLE OPTION IT'S BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND HELPS US -- REACH A ALREADY EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW THAT REQUIRES 75% RECYCLING COMPOSTING OR SOURCE REDUCTION OF SOLID WASTE BY TWENTY TWENTY SO WE CAN CONTINUE. TO DECREASE OUR RELIANCE ON LANDFILLS -- IT'S THIS BILL IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARD RESTORING PROTECTING OUR HEALTH -- IN OUR LOCAL ENVIRONMENT AND SO IS BECAUSE BECAUSE OF THESE REASONS THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT.

BY INCENTIVIZING BUSINESSES TO MAKE THE SWITCH TO REUSABLE OUR COMPOSTABLE CUTLERY CALIFORNIA CAN CONTINUE BEING A LEADER IN SINGLE USE PLASTIC REDUCTION AND WILL BE KEEPING IN LINE WITH THE STATE'S REQUIREMENT OF 75% RECYCLING. COMPOSTING OUR SOURCE RUSSIAN BY.

SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THE ASSEMBLY -- I'VE BEEN HIRING THE ID OF COMMUNITY TO DO -- SERVICE RESOLUTION IN MY DISTRICT FOR ALL SEVEN THOUSAND GRADUATES OF MY HIGH SCHOOLS THEY CALL LATE IN THE DAY PREPARE FOR EACH HIGH SCHOOL.

THANK YOU I THIS IS FOR TESTIMONY ONLY BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR CLOSING STATEMENTS I THINK THEY'RE RIGHT ON THE MARK SO WE WILL SEE YOU AND WHEN IT'S TIME TO VOTE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. I'M LIVING FILE ITEM ONE A. B. TEN SO REMEMBER CHIU WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR LET ME FIRST START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS -- WITH REGARDS TO THE FIVE YEAR SUNSET DATE AS WELL AS THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. AB TEN WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND EXPAND OUR STATES FOR WHAT HOUSING TAX CREDIT BY FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS -- THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT HAS BEEN EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL ONE THAT IN TERMS LEVERAGES ANOTHER ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL TAX CREDITS LOCAL TAX CREDITS AS WELL AS PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENTS. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS THIS IS MY FIFTH TIME MOVING FORWARD THIS BILL -- AND I WILL EXPLAIN WHY I AM HOPEFUL THAT THIS IS THE YEAR -- BUT I APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT OF THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL AS THE UNANIMOUS SUPPORT THE LAST TIME THIS WAS VOTED OUT FROM THIS LEGISLATURE TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK -- THAT WAS A. B. THIRTY FIVE A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO WHEN HIS VETOED BY GOVERNOR BROWN. THE REASON WE ARE HOPEFUL THIS YEAR IS THAT THEN CANDIDATE NOW GOVERNOR NEWSOME HAS STRONG STE AS CHORE HAS SHOWN STRONG SUPPORT FOR EXPANDING. THIS AFFORDABLE HOUSING TAX CREDIT IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET HE HAS PROPOSED A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR EXPANSION HIS RECENT PUT OUT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ON THIS PROPOSAL. I AND FOR THAT REASON WE ARE HOPEFUL SO AGAIN APPRECIATE THE PATIENCE OF THIS COMMITTEE AND AND HOPEFULLY THIS MIGHT BE THAT LAST YEAR. IN ADDITION TO INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT. AB TEN WILL MAKE THE CREDIT MORE VALUABLE AND INCREASE THE AMOUNT THE TAXPAYERS WILL PAY FOR IT. AB TEN WOULD REVISE A STATE LAW EXEMPTING THIS FROM THE PASSIVE ACTIVITY LOS RULES WHICH WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE EQUITY PRICING OF THIS TAX CREDIT. THE BILL WOULD ALSO EXPAND THE ABILITY OF INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYERS TO CLAIM THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT BY ELIMINATING THE SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR CAP. ON AN INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYERS OFFSET FOR PASSIVE RENTAL REAL ESTATE ACTIVITIES IN COMPUTING TAXABLE INCOME. LET ME JUST CLOSE BY SAYING WE HAVE MOVED FOR A LOT OF POLICIES IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS TO ADDRESS THE WORST HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. I AND MY HOPE IS WE WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD MORE BILLS AROUND PRODUCTION AROUND PRESERVING HOUSING AROUND HOW WE PROTECT INDIVIDUALS. WHO ARE AT RISK OF BEING EVICTED BUT THIS NEEDS TO BE A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF HOW WE SOLVE OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS AND HOW WE PROVIDE RESOURCES TO THOSE WHO ARE DOING THE MOST WORK? TO HELP AND ARE CRISIS SO WITH THAT I WANT TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESS. MS WHITE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS RENO WENT WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM PLEASE TO BECAUSE FUNDING THIS FOR I GUESS THE FIFTH TIME -- AND THE ONLY THING I WANT TO ADD IS JUST HOW CRITICAL THE TAX CREDIT PROGRAM IS TEMPORE BY HOUSING PRODUCTION THERE IS NO AFFORDABLE HOUSING ELEMENT IN THE STATE THAT I CAN THINK OF THE DOESN'T HAVE TAX CREDIT EQUITY AS OR THE BASE FUNDING SOURCE AND WHILE. WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL GRATEFUL TO LEGISLATURE IN THE STATE FOR PASSING -- HOUSING BONDS PREVIOUSLY A FOR PASSING A PERMANENT SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING ALL OF THOSE GET PAIRED WITH THE HOUSING CREDIT. AND WITHOUT SORT OF EXPANDING THE POOL OF THE HOUSING CREDIT WE CAN'T BILL WE CAN INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS ACROSS THE BOARD -- WITHOUT A CREDIT LIKE THIS AND SO IT REALLY CRITICAL AND HELPFUL -- THAT THIS YEAR WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN OUR DRIVE UP TODAY. THANK YOU JUST A WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. NAME AND AFFILIATION. REVENUE CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS PLAY JOHNSON WHO ABOUT HIS TEACHERS A FEW ON A MOCK PROCOL SPONSORED LEGISLATION. BUT I THINK THIS SUMMER FOR THE SHIP OF THE PORT ISSUE THANK YOU. CHRISLEY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES IN SUPPORT.

COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE THOUGHT QUIRK. SO ARM EVER SINCE THE END OF REDEVELOPMENT YES OKAY THANK YOU EVER SINCE THE END OF REDEVELOPMENT THERE'S BEEN LESS. LOCAL MONEY GOING TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF BRINGING REDEVELOPMENT BACK I THINK THEY WERE TOO MANY. ABUSES HOW AND ALTHOUGH MY COMMUNITY ALWAYS DID IT THE RIGHT WAY BUT EVEN SO THEY DON'T WANT IT TO COME BACK THEY SAID THE THE COLLAPSE OF THE PROGRAM'S SOMETHING THEY NEVER WANT TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH AGAIN. NONE THE LESS THIS WOULD BE A WAY OF GETTING MONEY THAT THE STATE WAS ALLOCATING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING BACK TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO I'M CERTAINLY IN FAVOR OF THAT. THE ONE COMMENT WE HAVE. FOUR ODD THAT IN HERE IS THAT BECAUSE IT TAX CREDIT IS WORTH LESS THAN A DOLLAR -- WOULD IT MAKE SENSE TO MAKE THIS A GRANT PROGRAM I THINK THERE MAY BE A PROBLEM THERE AND BRINGING THEM ON THE FEDERAL MONEY IF YOU DO THAT BUT I DON'T KNOW -- WOULD YOU ADDRESS THAT ISSUE SHOULD IT BE A GRANT PROGRAM AND IF YOU DID THAT WOULD IT BE A PROBLEM GETTING THE FEDERAL MONEY SO THE ANSWER IS ABSOLUTELY YES THE POINT WE STRUCTURE THIS IS TO LEVERAGE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT DOLLARS WHICH ARE VERY WELL ESTABLISHED. FEDERAL PROGRAM AND AND ESSENTIALLY WE CAN LEVERAGE -- TWO OR THREE ACTS FOR EVERY STATE DOLLARS THAT WE APPLY SO THAT'S WHY WE STRUCTURE IT THIS WAY AND NOW WE ALSO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE IN THIS BILL. TO INCREASE THE VALUE OF THE TAX CREDIT SO HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET TO A DOLLAR OR MORE. GREAT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THING I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. TO SOME HALF OF THE TWO DOZEN -- LEGISLATIVE AUTHORS OF THIS THAT REPRESENT THE POLITICAL DIVERSITY OF THE LEGISLATURE REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS THE GEOGRAPHIC AND AND IDEOLOGICAL DIVERSITY OF OUR LEGISLATURE. APPRECIATE THE CONSIDERATION HOPE WERE ABLE TO MOVE THIS ONE LAST TIME THANK YOU. IN A FILING FOURTEEN AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SIX ASSEMBLYMEMBER LIVING. YOU TO RECOGNIZE ME DID YOU. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT MADAM CHAIR OF MEMBERS AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SIX IS A BILL THAT SOUNDS LIKE FREEDOM. IT. THANK YOU MISTER QUIRK IS. YOU KNOW WAY BACK IN IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES THE STATE WAS A FISCAL BASKET CASE I REMEMBER THAT FROM HAVING DOUBLE DIGIT TUITION INCREASES THAT OUR PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. WE ALSO DECIDED. TO TAX NEWS WE THOUGHT. GETTING IN THE WAY OF AN INFORMED CITIZENRY WAS A GOOD IDEA. TO BALANCE CALIFORNIA'S BUDGET AND SO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR PUT A TAX ON PRINT NEWSPAPERS. OF COURSE ONLINE JOURNALISM IS NOT TAXED BUT THERE IS THIS DOUBLE STANDARD. ON PRINT NEWS NOW OF COURSE WE WANT LOCAL WE WANT OUR RESIDENTS ARE CONSTITUENTS TO BE INFORMED. AND WE WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO GET LOCAL NEWS. AND SO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY NOW THAT OUR FISCAL HOUSE IN ORDER THAT WE WORKED REALLY HARD THE PAST SIX YEARS TO DO THAT. THAT WE CAN'T TAKE THIS DOUBLE STANDARD AWAY. AND ENDED THIS DOUBLE STANDARD AND END OF THIS TAX ON PRINT NEWS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE AN INFORMED CITIZENRY. THAT IS THE POINT OF THIS BILL. AND WITH ME TODAY I HAVE A GUEST TO ALSO TESTIFIED. MADAM CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TOM NEWTON REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION -- CN PA IS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS OLD PLUS OR MINUS AND REPRESENTS MOST THE DAILY NEWSPAPERS IN THE STATE. ABOUT SIXTY SIX ON ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE WEEKLY NEWSPAPERS. ANOTHER EIGHTY OR SO CAMPUS NEWSPAPERS AND ELEVEN DIGITAL NEWS NEWS ORGANIZATIONS WERE OPEN TO GROW THAT NUMBER -- IN -- NINETEEN NINETY ONE FACE WITH A HUGE DEFICIT -- FOR PREVIOUSLY EXEMPT ITEMS WERE. THEREAFTER TAXED NEWSPAPERS AND PERIODICALS. BOTTLED WATER CANDY AND SNACKS AND BUNKER FUEL WHICH IS STORED FUEL -- MOST OF THOSE EXEMPTIONS HAVE BEEN PUT BACK IN PLACE AS FAR AS NEWSPAPERS GO AND THE ANALYSIS THAT DOES A GOOD JOB OF POINTING THIS OUT -- TAX EXEMPTIONS WERE PRETTY QUICKLY PUT BACK IN PLACE FOR FREELY DISTRIBUTED NEWSPAPERS NEWSPAPERS CREATED BY -- EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS. AND ALSO -- AND NEWSPAPERS THAT -- OUR WEEKLY AS FAR AS SO LONG AS THEY ARE DELIVERED BY SUBSCRIPTION. REALLY WHAT'S LEFT IN THE TAX IS A TAX ON ABOUT SIXTY SIX DALY FIRST AMENDMENT SPEAKERS. AND THE OVER THE COUNTER. CIRCULATION OF WEEKLY NEWSPAPERS. IN. NINETEEN NINETY ONE THE NEWS PAPER BUSINESS WAS BOOMING -- NEWSPAPERS WERE VERY SECURE IN THEIR POSITION IN THE ECONOMY. AND EVERYONE KNEW THAT THEY WOULD SURVIVE PLACING A SALES TAX ON THEM. SINCE THAT TIME WE DON'T HAVE TO TALK TOO MUCH ABOUT THE DESTRUCTION THAT'S OCCURRED -- BUT SINCE -- FOR EIGHTEEN HUNDRED UNITED STATES NEWSPAPERS ARE NO LONGER. BEING PUBLISHED IN THIS COUNTRY -- WE'RE WORK ADVANCING THREE ARGUMENTS FOR WHY THIS COMMITTEE SHOULD PASS THIS BILL. THE FIRST IS THAT NEWSPAPERS CONTINUE TO CREATE A COMMUNITY FORUM. THEY EXIST TO PROFESSIONALLY GATHER. AT IT. AND CREATE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF DAILY AND WEEKLY INFORMATION. THAT HELPS ALL CALIFORNIANS TO BE BETTER IT HELPS OUR COMMUNITIES TO BE BETTER AND RESEARCH BEARS THIS OUT -- A RECENT -- NEWMAN LAB ARTICLE JUST READ YOU THE LEAD GRAPH IT SAYS WHAT DO STRONG LOCAL NEWSPAPERS DO. WELL RESEARCH SHOWS THEY INCREASE VOTER TURNOUT REDUCE GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION MAKE CITIES FINANCIALLY HEALTHIER MAKES IT IS A MOREKNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT POLITICS AND MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT. FORCE LOCAL TV TO RAISE ITS GAME AND ENCOURAGE SPLIT TICKET AND MORE DIVERSE VOTING -- WE BELIEVE THAT NEWSPAPERS ARE STILL FIGHTING. TO TO THIS ROLE AND ARE STILL DOING IT -- THE SECOND THING AND THIS IS BEEN COVERED -- THE TAXES PATENTLY UNFAIR AS IT RELATES TO ABOUT SIXTY SIX FIRST AMENDMENT SPEAKERS. AS OPPOSED TO THE INTERNET AND ALL THE SPEAKERS THAT ARE OUT THERE -- WE'RE TAXING THE PEOPLE WHO WERE STILL IN THEIR COMMUNITIES CREATING. INFORMATION FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PUBLIC AND WE'RE EXEMPTING THAT AGGREGATORS AND SCRAPERS AND PROCESS ESPECIALLY THE DUOPOLY. THERE BECAUSE SO MUCH HAVOC -- FINALLY. NEWSPAPERS ARE AND THEY'RE STILL FIGHTING -- WHAT'S LEFT OF THE NEWSPAPER BUSINESS IS STILL ANXIOUS. TO GET HIS FEET UNDER IT TO FIND A NEW BUSINESS MODEL. AND TO CONTINUE TO SERVE CALIFORNIANS. FOR ALL THOSE REASONS WE ASK YOUR AYE VOTE WHEN THIS COMES BEFORE I WANT TO MAKE ONE ONE MORE POINT THAT UP FOR CLARIFICATION THIS IS A TAX ON THE CONSUMER WHO BUYS THE NEWSPAPER TO READ AND BECOME INFORMED IT'S NOT A TAX ON THE BUSINESS. IT'S A TAX ON A PERSON WHO WANTS TO PURCHASE THAT NEWSPAPER. ADDITIONAL TESTS MY IN SUPPORT. TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION. SCENE NINE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE DARK QUIRK -- SO. I'M NOT. SO IN OTHER WORDS RIGHT NOW IF I PAY SIXTY SIX DOLLARS A YEAR. TO GET TO A NEWSPAPER I'D HAVE TO PAY SIXTY INSTEAD. IF THE TAX WENT DOWN -- THERE IS A TAX APPLIED ON TO THE COST OF THE NEWSPAPER -- I I I DON'T KNOW BUT BASICALLY IT WOULD REDUCE MY COST BY ABOUT 10% I'M NOT. I WOULD HAVE TO CLARIFY EXACTLY WHAT THE COST OF THE TAXES WELL RIGHT I THINK THE QUESTION IS IS YES WITH THE TAX WITH THE SAVINGS OF THE SALES TAX BECAUSE YOU'RE SAYINGTHIS IS A SALES TAX THAT CONSUMERS ARE PAYING WITH THAT WOULD THAT SAVINGS GO DIRECTLY. TO THE CONSUMER OR SAYING THAT THE CHALLENGE ON NEWSPAPERS. THEY'RE GOING TO USE THEM TAX MONEY THEY'RE GONNA KEEP CHARGING THE SAME PRICE AND SPEND THAT TAX MONEY ON OTHER THINGS I THINK THAT OUT OF THE CLOSET AND THE TAXES A SURCHARGE ON THE CONSUMER. SO PRECISELY YOUR POINT YOU WOULD BE SAVING THE MONEY THAT WOULD NOT SO I'D SAY SIX DOLLARS YEAR -- MY CONCERN IS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE NO LOCAL NEWSPAPERS AND ALAMEDA CONTRA COSTA COUNTY SORRY TO HEAR THAT AND I I HONESTLY THINK WHAT WOULD HAPPEN GIVEN THE CORPORATE STRUCTURE IS THEY JUST KEEP FEET SIXTY SIX DOLLARS AND KEEP THE SIX DOLLARS -- WE USED TO HAVE SIX REPORTERS IN HAYWARD NOW WE GET A HALF OF REPORTER EVERY OTHER MONTH -- I I JUST DON'T THINK IT THIS WOULD BRING IT BACK BUT I'M STILL WILLING TO CONSIDER THE BELL. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS IN THE COMMITTEE. I A I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR QUALITY NEWSPAPERS -- BUT I THINK MY QUESTION IS THE SAME IS THAT IS THIS SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO PASS ON I I I'M GETTING KIND OF CONFLICTING MESSAGES ONE IS SAYING THAT THE SALES TAX IS PART OF THE DEMISE OF THE EIGHTEEN HUNDRED PAPERS THAT HAVE GONE OUT OF BUSINESS. BUT I'M ALSO GETTING THE MESSAGE THAT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT SALES TAX IS NO LONGER PAID BY THE CONSUMER. BUT IT'S GOING TO BE PASSED TO THE CONSUMER AND SO I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE CONFUSION THERE AND AT SOME POINT IT WOULD BE GREAT SINCE IS THIS TESTIMONY ONLY FOR US TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AND CLARIFY -- EXACTLY WHAT THE INTENT IS A BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE RESPECT FOR QUALITY NEWSPAPERS AND I DO WANT TO SEE THEM THRIVE BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND AS A COMMITTEE WHAT THE GOALS ARE. IS THE GOAL TO PASS THAT BACK ON TO ROUTE TO CONSUMERS OR IS THE GOAL TO TAKE THAT MONEY AND INVESTED IN SOME OTHER WAY WITH NEWSPAPERS [inaudible] ARE YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO SINCE THIS IS TESTIMONY ONLY AND NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO WORK OUT SOME OF THESE. I WOULD APPRECIATE HEARING IT. SHOW -- IT'S A MARKET BASED DECISION RIGHT AND AND EVERY CONSUMER OF NEWS HAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GOING TO PAY THE AMOUNT. OF THE PRINT SUBSCRIPTION. OR PURCHASE THE OVER COUNTER OVER THE COUNTER COPY -- THE TAXES ADDED TO THAT. IF THE TAX IS REPEALED. EACH NEWSPAPER. IS GOING TO HAVE TO DETERMINE -- HOW IT PRICES IT'S NEWSPAPERS GOING FORWARD I SUSPECT THAT MOST NEWSPAPERS WILL -- GIVE THAT MONEY BACK TO THE CONSUMER BY LOWERING THEIR BETTER PRICE BUT I CAN'T SAY THAT -- WITH EXACTITUDE AND IN FACT -- I SUSPECT THAT SOME NEWSPAPERS WOULD LOVE TO RE EMPLOY. SOME OF THE LARGE NUMBER OF REPORTERS THAT ARE NO LONGER DOING THAT JOB. AN END TO THAT THE LITTLE BIT OF THAT POINT THE AMOUNT OF TAX REVENUE HAS. BEEN DECIMATED -- IN THE COURSE OF THE PAST TWENTY YEARS -- IT'S A FRACTION OF WHAT WAS ONCE COLLECTED. ANY OTHER REASON. SO ESSENTIALLY IT WILL BE UP TO THE INDIVIDUAL NEWSPAPER WHETHER OR NOT THEY LEAVE THE PRICE WHERE IT IS OUR RETURN THAT THAT. PORTION TO THE CONSUMER -- OKAY SO. I APOLOGIZE I HAD ANOTHER COMMITTEE THAT I HAD TO BE PRESIDENT'S I MISSED MOST OF THE CONVERSATION BUT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT THE THE TAX WOULD BE. TAKEN AWAY WHICH WOULD BE A SAVINGS TO THE CUSTOMER RIGHT. AND THE CONCERN IS THOUGH THAT NEWSPAPERS WELL KEEP THE PRICE THE SAME IF THE PAPERS FOR DOLLARS -- IN THE TALES TAXES TAKEN AWAY IT WILL THE NEWSPAPER TO GET TO KEEP IT FOR DOLLARS BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S USED TO PAYING FOUR DOLLARS [inaudible] RIGHT. THAT THAT'S THE FEAR THAT I AND THAT. OKAY YEAH AND SO THAT'S CERTAINLY. ONE ONE POTENTIAL OUTCOME -- I THINK EACH OF THE NEWSPAPERS WILL DEAL WITH THAT THEIR OWN WAY BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT. MANY WOULD LOVE TO INVEST. SOME OF THAT REVENUE BACK INTO THEIR COMMUNITY. BY EMPLOYING. NEWS GATHERERS TO SERVE THEIR COMMUNITY -- SO WHAT I'M HEARING IS AS A RESULT OF THE REDUCTION OF SUBSCRIPTIONS THE PAIR FOLKS HAVE BEEN LAID OFF THE HOPE IS THAT SOME WILL USE SOME OF THE SALES TAX TO PUT WERE WHAT THAT SPACE LOOKS LIKE IN TO RE EMPLOYING SOME OF THE OLD REPORTERS WHILE OTHERS. WILL RETURN THAT COST TO AT THE CUSTOMERS BUT THAT'S ON IN THE BILL AS IT'S WRITTEN TODAY -- ALL RIGHTS AS ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE EVERYONE'S CLEAR. WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YEAH SURE THANK YOU AGAIN MANAGER THANK YOU COMMITTEE FOR THE THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSION THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET. GOVERNMENT OUT OF THE WAY OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A A A A CONSTITUENT A CALIFORNIAN AND THEIR ACCESS TO LOCAL NEWS AT A TIME. WHEN -- A QUITE FRANKLY THERE ARE A LOT OF POLITICIANS WHO ARE TRYING TO UNDERMINE THE NEWS THAT WE RECEIVE AND AT IT MY HOPE IS THAT WE CAN BOLSTER THAT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THOSE WHO GATHER AND REPORT LOCAL NEWS AND THOSE WHO NEED. TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION TO MAKE GOOD DECISIONS IN SOCIETY THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU MOVING A FILE I AM NINE AB TWELVE FIFTY NINE ASSEMBLY MEMBER REAVIS WHICH YOU LIKE TO OPEN.

AB TWELVE FIFTY NINE WOULD CREATE A STATE NEW MARKETS TAX CREDIT PROGRAM MODELED OFF THE SUCCESSFUL FEDERAL AN MTC PROGRAM.

WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEN IN COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS WHICH LIKE. MOVING TO FILE ITEM OF FIVE EIGHTY NINE SEVENTY EIGHT THANK YOU AT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR EIGHTY NINE SEVENTY EIGHT EIGHTY NINE SEVENTY EIGHT INSURES THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY BUSINESSES ARE NOT DOUBLE TAXED WHEN ENGAGING WITH BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF TEXAS. IN ORDER TO AVOID PAYING TAXES ON THE SAME INCOME IN MULTIPLE STATES CALIFORNIA GENERALLY ALLOWS AND OTHER STATE TAX CREDIT FOR TAXES PAID TO OTHER STATES. THE OS T. C. ENSURES THAT RESIDENT FAMILY BUSINESSES ARE NOT DOUBLE TAXED AND COULD TAKE CREDIT FOR THEIR SHARE OF TAXES PAID TO OTHER STATES WHEN THOSE TAXES ARE MEASURED BY GROSS OR NET INCOME. AND THE SAME ARRANGEMENT ACTUALLY THIS KIND OF AT A FEDERAL LEVEL WITH WITH OTHER COUNTRIES. RECENTLY THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD ISSUED A NEW GUIDANCE THAT DENIES ALL CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS A TAX CREDIT FOR TAXES PAID. FOR THE REVISED TEXAS MARGINS TAX WILL CALL THAT THE R. T. F. T.. SINCE TEXAS DOES NOT HAVE INCOME TAXES FAMILY BUSINESSES HAVE RELIED ON THE LONG HELD UNDERSTANDING WITHIN CALIFORNIA THAT THE R. T. F. T. IS TREATED THE SAME AS A TRADITIONAL INCOME TAX. AND THEREFORE LIES A RESIDENT FAMILY BUSINESS TO CLAIM THE O. S. T. C.. TEXAS LAW ALLOWS FOR TAXPAYERS TO DETERMINE THEIR TEXAS TAX OBLIGATION BASED ON ONE OF SEVERAL METHODOLOGIES. THE F. T. B. I. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN ISSUED A REVISED INTERPRETATION AND NOW. THAT INTERPRETATION SAYS THAT BECAUSE DIFFERENT TAXPAYERS COULD DETERMINE THEIR TAX BURDEN DIFFERENTLY. A SUB CHAPTER S. CORPORATION COULD NOT RECEIVE THE O. S. T. C.. EIGHTY NINE SEVENTY EIGHT WOULD ACTUALLY NOW ROLL BACK THAT RULING MADE BY THE F. T. B. AND ALLOW FAMILY BUSINESSES TO CONTINUE OPERATING AS THEY WERE. BY CLARIFYING THE TAXES PAID TO ANOTHER STATE BE DETERMINED BY THE ACTUAL METHOD USED TO CALCULATE THE TAX WITHOUT REGARD. TO METHODS ALLOWED BY THE OTHER STATES. I I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THE COMMITTEE SUPPORT AND DIVE THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANALYSIS AND WILL WERE WORKING TEN MEN THE BELL TO INCLUDE A SUNSET DATE AND AS THE ADDITIONAL MEASURES IN SECTION. FORTY ONE I AND I AM PLEASED TO INTRODUCE TO SUPPORTERS HERE TO TESTIFY DENNIS ALLEY ANI FROM THE PANELISTS FAMILY BUSINESS ASSOCIATION. AND A SLIPPER FROM BACK TELL. I'LL BE THE FIRST OF TEAM DENNIS TO START. HELLO MY NAME IS DENNIS ALBION ARABS AND FAMILY BUSINESS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIAN WITH THE SPONSORS A. B.. NINE SEVENTY EIGHT WELL TAX LAW CAN OFTEN GET VERY DOWN ON THE WEEK VERY QUICKLY WHAT WHAT AB NINE SEVENTY EIGHT BASICALLY DOES IS THE CONSISTENT POLICY OF CALIFORNIA'S NOT TO DOUBLE TAX. INCOME TAX OF FROM OTHER STATES SO THAT'S WHY THEY CREATED THE OTHER STATE TAX CREDIT. MANY FAMILY BUSINESSES ARE PASSED THROUGH OUR STRUCTURE TO PASS THROUGH ORGANIZATIONS AND SPECIFICALLY IN TWENTY TEN THE STATE OF TEXAS MADE CHANGES TO ITS TAXATION SYSTEM. OF FOLLOWING THOSE CHANGES TAXES PAID WERE TREATED AS INCOME TAX SO SO AT THAT TIME IT WAS INCOME TAX [inaudible] OF AND THEN A TWENTY SIXTEEN AFTER DEEMED STAFF PROVIDED A NEW INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW. SUBJECT TO MANY THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY OWNED BUSINESSES HEADQUARTERED HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- THAT HAVE OPERATIONS IN TEXAS. TO PAY -- DOT BASICALLY DOUBLE TAXATION. AND EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE USING A METHODOLOGY OF TAX PAYMENT. THAT WAS AN INCOME TAX BECAUSE SOME TAXPAYER OUT THERE COULD USE A DIFFERENT -- CHOICE OF OF PAYING THEIR TAXES -- TO TEXAS. THEY DISQUALIFIED THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS WHOSE PAINT ON AN INCOME TAX SO THAT'S THE GIST OF IT -- WE HAVE BEEN -- CONVERSE WITH F. T. V. THAN GOING BACK AND FORTH ON SOME OF THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS THAT AND AND THAT. AND BUT THEY DID BRING UP A COUPLE POINTS IN A JUST. ONE TO ADDRESS THEM SO THAT THEY ARE AND I AND I KNOW WHEN WE TALK TO SOME COMMITTEE MEMBERS THEY BROUGHT UP ALMOST GO. SO WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE SCOPE OF THIS -- POTENTIAL -- AREA SO WHAT WELL THAT'D FTV BROUGHT THAT UP IS CONCERNED. THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THE THEY THEY'RE THE ONES THAT HAVE THE NUMBERS TO KNOW HOW MANY FOLKS. FROM TWENTY TEN TO TWENTY SIXTEEN ACTUALLY QUALIFIED FOR THE S. T. C.. AND THEN AFTER TWENTY SIXTEEN DON'T QUALIFY FOR SO UP WE WE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE WORK WOULD HAVE TO BE TO GET THAT THAT -- DELINEATED BUT AT THIS POINT WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT -- AS THEY HAVE THE DATA AND AND AS WE WHATNOT SO -- BUT WE DO WANT TO SAY THAT THAT THAT'S BEEN. WE ARGUE THAT IT'S THAT IT WOULDN'T COST ANYTHING BECAUSE THE FACT THAT FROM TEN IT WAS THE LAW TO SIXTEEN AND STABBED HER PATIENT. PUT THAT AND WE JUST BE GOING BACK TO THE WAY IT WAS. BEFORE THE TWENTY SIXTEEN ACOSTA AFTER PETITION. SO THAT'S THE SCOPE -- ONE OTHER ISSUE -- IS THE TALKED ABOUT THAT THIS WOULD CHANGE THE LAW THE THE THE THE THE LAW. THE LAW THE INTERPRETATIONS AND THE FACT IS THIS WOULD RELY ON ALL THE THE THE COURT CASES AND ALL THE DEFINITIONS THERE'S NO CHANGING DEFINITIONS -- OF ANYTHING AT THIS POINT IT JUST ALLOWS. FOR WHEN YOU DO WITH THE INCOME TAX TO BE ABLE TO APPLY THAT IF YOU PAY THAT WAY TO THE ACTUAL WAY YOU YOU APPLY YOUR TAX SO. THOSE ARE A COUPLE OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT UP I THOUGHT I WOULD DRESS AND I'LL TURN OVER THE MISTER LOW. FOR A DENTIST LÃ  PRODUCTO LACED S. CORPORATION. BASICALLY WHAT MISTER ROBINSON IS IS THE MOST RELEVANT THERE'S BEEN NOTHING SINCE THE ORIGINAL. HAVE TO BE -- A GUIDANCE AND AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THERE'S BEEN NO CHANGE WHATSOEVER IN THE LAW THERE'S BEEN NO CHANGE IN COURT DECISION SINCE AT THAT TIME. SO SOMEBODY HAD AN EPIPHANY IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND REVERSED -- WITH THE TAXPAYERS OF KNOWING FOR ALL THOSE YEARS OF MAKES NO SENSE -- SO BECAUSE OF THE FLIP UP WE THINK IT NEEDS GUIDANCE OF THE OF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE RATHER THAN. LETTING BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT LEGAL WOULD DO AND AGAIN AND TEN MORE YEARS SO FOR THOSE REASONS MASTERS. FOR WHAT ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION XENON COMES IN QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE DOCTOR QUIRK -- SO. THIS IS OF COURSE FAIRLY CONFUSING BUT ONE OF THE COMMENTS -- BY STAFF. IS THAT THE TEXAS TAX IS MUCH LIKE. TAXES IN OTHER STATES WHICH ARE NOT TREATED AS INCOME TAXES THAT IN FACT IT'S A TAX ON GROSS RECEIPTS RATHER THAN ON INCOME -- IS THAT CORRECT. THE TEXAS TAX HAS THREE METHODS ONE OF THOSE METHODS WHICH WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS IN WHICH THE TAXPAYERS USUALLY ADDRESS IS THE COST OF GOODS SOLD FOR WHICH FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. AGREES IS A INCOME TAX OR GROSS INCOME. YEAH THERE IS NOT A CONTROVERSY FOR WITH FTV THAT THAT THAT IF YOU USE COST OF GOODS SOLD THAT THAT ISN'T AN INCOME TAX. WHY IS COST OF GOODS SOLD IN INCOME TAX YOU CAN SELL THINGS AND HAVE NO INCOME? BECAUSE YOUR COSTS ARE GREATER I THINK. YOUR METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING PROFIT BASE AND COST OF GOODS SOLD. OH OH OKAY FINE. ALL RIGHT SO THERE IS A WAY THAT THIS CAN BE AN INCOME TAX IN TEXAS [inaudible] YES. BUT YOU GET TO CHOOSE WHETHER IT'S IN INCOME TAX OR ANOTHER KIND OF TAX. YES THE THE THE ACTUALLY TEXAS LAW. IS DOES NOT ALLOW FOR SPECIFIC INCOME TAX BUT RECOGNIZES AS THE COST OF GOODS SOLD OF METHOD OF CALCULATING THE TAX AS AN AS IS BASICALLY TAXES SO BASICALLY IT'S TAXING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. WHAT IT COST YOU TO PRODUCE THE GOOD AND WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AND? IN. AND WHEN YOU SALAS IS THAT WHAT IT DOES. SO THAT'S ONE WAY THEY CAN TAX AND THEN THEY HAVE OTHER WAYS THEY CAN TAX. IN A COMPANY CAN CHOOSE WHICH WAY IT WANTS TO DO IT PROBABLY BASED UPON -- WHAT'S MOST FAVORABLE TO THEM. IS THAT CORRECT. AFTER THREE DIFFERENT WAYS OF DOING IT. YOUR CONSULT CAN ANSWER THAT BETTER THAN I CAN ALL RIGHT. THIS IS CONFUSING. THE GOAL IS JUST TO ENSURE THAT. YOU WHETHER YOU ARE SELLING TEXAS OR SELLING PRODUCTS IN PENNSYLVANIA AND MAKING. A PROFIT THERE THAT THE WAY THAT THE TAXATION IS TREATED. IS UNIFORMS AND FAIR AND THAT WE DO NOT HAVE A POLICY OF DOUBLE TAXATION. FOR IF ANY OF RIGHT AND AND I AGREE WITH THAT THE PROBLEM IS THE F. T. V.. HAS PEOPLE WHO PROBABLY DO UNDERSTAND THIS BILL AND LIKE THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM EXCEPT PERHAPS FOR COMMITTEE STAFF. AND THEY VIEWED IT AS NOT AND SO I I'M JUST I NEED A LOT MORE INFORMATION BEFORE I COULD VOTE ON THIS AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR TV I THINK TO TO CLARIFY SOME OF THE DISCREPANCY I THINK BETWEEN. THEIR UNDERSTANDING AND AND OUR UNDERSTANDING I THINK RIGHT WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS. IN MY MIND IS THAT THERE WAS AN INTERPRETATION CHANGE THAT WAS MADE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHICH AS WE HIGHLIGHTED. THAT WAS NOT PROMPTED BY ANY LEGISLATIVE ACTION READY TO SERVE EXECUTIVE ACTION IT IT WAS JUST A RE INTERPRETATION YEAH BUT THEY'RE SAYING THAT'S MORE IN LINE WITH WHAT THEY'RE DOING FOR OTHER STATES. AND ARE WE GONNA HAVE AN A A BILL ON INDIANA TAX NEXT -- SO I JUST NEED TO UNDERSTAND A LOT MORE. GREAT THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I THINK I THINK THAT WE I THINK THAT. I ALSO WOULD JUST LIKE A LITTLE BIT MORE I KNOW WE'RE WORKING ON WITH THE UNIVERSE LOOKS LIKE. CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT WITH THE NEW INTERPRETATION OR THE INTERPRETATION AS IT STANDS NOW I UNDERSTAND IT WAS A CHANGE AND THAT IT WAS GO IT'S GOING BACK I UNDERSTAND ALL OF THAT. BUT I THINK WE STILL WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE UNIVERSE IS IS THIS A BILL FOR SIX PEOPLE OR IS THIS ACTUALLY LIKE A FAMILY OUR ESTIMATE NOW AND WHERE I LIVE. AGAIN STILL CLICK CONFIRMING THIS THAT THE FTV BUT THE CURRENT ESTIMATE IS THAT IT'S APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FAMILY OWNED BUSINESSES THAT WOULD SUBSTANTIVELY THAT ARE BEING SUBSTANTIVELY PENALIZED BY THIS REINTERPRETATION. AND I IN THAT AREA OF ABOUT. TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED FAMILY OWNED BUSINESSES THAT ARE BEING IMPACTED HERE AROUND A THOUSAND DOLLARS OR LESS. ALL RIGHT I THINK THAT'S THE FIRST WE FOR THAT I THINK YOU. ON ANY WOULD LIKE CLOSE. AS I SAID I THINK THE THE OBJECTIVE WITH THIS SPELL IS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE. FAIR AND CONSISTENT HI TAX POLICY THAT TREATS EARNINGS IN TEXAS THE SAME AS IT TREATS EARNINGS. ANYWHERE IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY AND WILL CERTAINLY CONTINUE TO WORK WITH COMMITTEE STAFF AND THEY HAVE TO BE IN COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP TO ENSURE THAT.

THANK YOU CHAIR WOMAN I AM BACK WITH MY YEARLY ATTEMPT TO MAKE DIAPERS TAX FREE -- AS WE KNOW YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE A POLICY OF TAXING THINGS THAT ARE HEALTH NECESSITIES OF WHICH DIAPERS ARE. BEYOND THAT -- WE KNOW THAT ONE IN THREE FAMILIES NATIONWIDE STRUGGLE THEY ADMIT TO STRUGGLING AND NOT USING OF A CORRECT AMOUNT OF DIAPERS ON THEIR CHILDREN BECAUSE OF THE EXPENSE OF DIAPERS. THE COST TO DIAPER A CHILD RANGES FROM ABOUT A HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH PROBABLY. MR MULLIN PAYS MORE THAN THAT WITH TWO CHILDREN -- AND THE TAX ON THOSE DIAPERS THEN. FOR THE YEAR IS ENOUGH TO PAY FOR A FULL MONTH SUPPLY OF DIAPERS SO THIS IS AN INCONSEQUENTIAL IT'S NOT -- TO DO SOMETHING BECAUSE IT FEELS GOOD IT'S TO DO SOMETHING BECAUSE WE DESPERATELY NEED IT. I IN CALIFORNIA ALONE OVER 60% OF CHILDREN ARE BORN INTO POVERTY. ABOUT THAT NUMBER ARE BORN ON MEDI CAL AND IF YOU LOOK AT CHILDREN WHO ARE BROWN AND BLACK THAT NUMBER GOES UP TO ABOUT TWO THIRDS. SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT MOST BABIES WE KNOW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE BORN INTO FAMILIES WHO ARE STRUGGLING -- TO PAY THE BILLS AND THOSE WHO AREN'T -- THOSE WHO ARE KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE CLASS WE CAN TALK ABOUT THEM AS WELL BECAUSE THE PROGRAMS THAT WE USUALLY DESIGNATOR TO HELP WORKING CLASS FAMILIES AND POOR FAMILIES. BUT THE MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES WHO -- ARE OFTEN THE MOST VULNERABLE TIME ECONOMICALLY AND ARE HAVING YOUNG CHILDREN ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY THE COST OF DIAPERS AND SO OBVIOUSLY -- TO RELIEVE TAXES IN A WAY THAT WOULD FOR A FILL A FULL MONTH'S SUPPLY OF DIAPERS A SOMETHING THAT COULD BE HELPFUL TO A VAST MAJORITY AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS. I THINK THIS IS -- AN IMPORTANT FEATURE BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST A AYE DESIGNATION OF SOMETHING THAT -- WE KNOW SHOULD BE DONE IT ACTUALLY HELPS INDIVIDUALS AND I HAVE BEEN TOLD TIME AND TIME AGAIN -- THAT I SHOULD GO LOOK AT OTHER WAYS TO HELP PEOPLE A DIAPER NEED AND WE'VE DONE JUST THAT THIS LEGISLATURE PASS THE FIRST IN THE NATION. EFFORTS TO HELP US -- INDIVIDUALS ON CAL WORKS OBTAIN DIAPER SO THAT THEY CAN PUT THEIR CHILDREN IN CHILD CARE AND GET A JOB OR GO TO SCHOOL THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THOSE OF US WHO HAVE KIDS AND UNDERSTAND. THE YOU CANNOT SEND YOUR CHILD TO CHILD CARE WITHOUT EIGHT OR TEN DIAPERS FOR THE DAY -- WE HAD TREMENDOUS STORIES OF WOMEN WHO HAD FINALLY GOTTEN SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE HAD FOUND THEMSELVES A JOB SHOWED UP THE FIRST DAY IN COULD NOT DROP THEIR CHILD OFF BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE AN EXTRA EIGHT TO TEN DIAPERS. WE ALLEVIATED THAT PROBLEM THROUGH -- THROUGH A CAL WORKS AND THERE IS NOW AN ABILITY TO GET UP TO THIRTY DIAPERS THIRTY DOLLARS WORTH OF DIAPERS FOR THE MONTH THAT'S A POSITIVE IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. LAST YEAR WE ALLOCATED TEN MILLION DOLLARS STATEWIDE FOR THREE YEARS TO DO PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS WITH FOUR AREAS THE STATE THAT CURRENTLY HAVE DIAPER BANKS DIAPERED BANKS THAT ARE A CO JOINED WITH FOOD BANKS. AND ALTHOUGH THAT ALSO HELPS IT ESPECIALLY IN AREAS LIKE LOS ANGELES SAN DIEGO SAN FRANCISCO AND FRESNO WHERE THOSE ALLOCATIONS ARE BEING MADE. THEY'RE STILL FAR TOO MANY FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA WHO DON'T HAVE THAT EXTRA THE RELIEF THE ONLY WAY TO PROVIDE THAT RELIEF WHOLESALE ACROSS THE STATE IS TO START WITH DIAPER TAX. THE FACT THE DIAPERS ARE JUST TOO EXPENSIVE AND I BERNIE CONTINUES TO BE A PROBLEM CAN BE IT CAN AT LEAST START TO BE ALLEVIATED BY REMOVING THE DIAPER TAX WITH THAT I HAVE A COUPLE OF WITNESSES. AND HI THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN GONZALEZ. AT MADAM CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE I'M NOR WIND STEEN CO PRESIDENT OF BABY BABY A LOS ANGELES BASED NONPROFIT THAT PROVIDES CHILDREN IN POVERTY WITH DIAPERS CLOTHING AND ALL THE BASIC NECESSITIES THAT EVERY CHILD DESERVES. WE'VE DISTRIBUTED FIFTY MILLION ITEMS INCLUDING TWENTY NINE MILLION DIAPERS OVER THE LAST SEVEN YEARS TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN. OUR BABY BABY BOARD AMBASSADORS AN INCREDIBLE GROUP OF CALIFORNIA BASED MOTHERS INCLUDING JESSICA ALBA KERRY WASHINGTON AMY ADAMS KELLY ROWLAND KRISTEN BELL WHO SUPPORT OUR WORK EACH DAY. JUST LAST MONTH OUR BOARD MEMBER JULIE BOW ENJOYING IN SACRAMENTO TO SPEAK TO THE GOVERNOR TO GOVERNOR NEW SEVEN OTHER KEY STAKEHOLDERS. ABOUT THIS BILL. ONE IN THREE FAMILIES IN THIS COUNTRY ARE STRUGGLING TO AFFORD DIAPERS WHEN WE ASK A MOM A DAD OR A SOCIAL WORKER IN OUR PROGRAM WHAT THEY NEED MOST. THE FIRST SECOND AND THIRD THING THEY SAY IS DIAPERS. HARD WORKING MOTHERS IN OUR PROGRAM ARE LITERALLY EMPTYING OUT THEIR DISPOSABLE DIAPERS HANGING THEM TO DRY AND RE USING THEM ON THEIR BABIES. SO WE'RE HERE ON BEHALF OF JIMMY'S A MOTHER WE SERVE. WHO IS HOMELESS AND FORCED TO KEEP PERCENT RJ IN THE SAME DIAPER FOR DAYS AT A TIME? WE'RE HERE ON BEHALF OF RE ANY SHOT A MOTHER IN INGLEWOOD AND YOUR DISTRICT MADAM CHAIR WHO WAS LIVING IN HER CAR INTO WE GAVE HER DIAPERS AND SHE COULD USE THAT EXTRA MONEY TO GIVE TO MAKE HER RENT. WE'RE HERE ON BEHALF OF A LOVELY YOUNG WOMAN WHO WORKS AT THE STATE HOUSE EATERY DOWNSTAIRS. WHO WHO WHO WAS THRILLED TO LEARN THAT THIS BILL WAS BEING HEARD BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH SHE HAS A STEADY JOB THE COST OF DIAPERS IS MAKING HER LIFE THAT MUCH HARDER? THIS IS BECAUSE DIAPERS ARE EXPENSIVE IN THE MOST SHOCKING PART IS THE CHILD CARE CENTERS REQUIRING A FULL DAY'S SUPPLY OF DIAPERS FOR CHILDREN TO ATTEND. CREATING A BARRIER FOR MOMS IN OUR PROGRAM TO REENTER THE WORKFORCE. A LIMITED TAX FROM DIAPERS CAN HELP BREAK A VICIOUS CYCLE OF POVERTY WHEN THE FAMILIES WE SERVE HAVE DRY DIAPERS. THEY CAN RETURN TO WORK AND GET BACK ON THEIR FEET. CURRENTLY EIGHT STATES INCLUDING NEW YORK HAVE ELIMINATED THE SALES TAX ON DIAPERS AND CALIFORNIA OUR HOME STATE. WITH THE HIGHEST RATE OF CHILD POVERTY IN THE COUNTRY NEEDS TO JOIN THEM SO ON BEHALF OF ALL THE FAMILIES IN POVERTY WE SERVE. AND ALL OF THE FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING AB. SIXTY SIX ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. I NAME AND AFFILIATION. SORRY FOR THE HURT A GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME STILL VANDER CLAY -- I'M THE DIRECTOR OF POLICY GOVERNMENT LICENSE WITH THE NATIONAL DIAPER BANK NETWORK -- SO OUR NETWORK REPRESENTS MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED DIAPER BANKS NATIONWIDE INCLUDING FIFTEEN RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- THAT SERVE FORTY THREE THOUSAND CHILDREN EACH MONTH -- THESE NONPROFIT PROGRAM SISTER BE MORE THAN TWELVE POINT FOUR MILLION FREE DIAPERS EACH YEAR TO CHILDREN AND FAMILIES LIVING IN POVERTY -- AND ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL BY BURBANK NETWORK I FIRST LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ FOR HER. STEADFAST COMMITMENT TO ENDING DIAPER NEED -- CAM TRAILBLAZING LEGISLATION IS REALLY BEEN AN IMPORTANT ISSUE -- RENOWNED NOT JUST HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO A ACROSS THE COUNTRY -- AND OR OR CERTAINLY ALL BETTER FOR IT SO THANK YOU -- AND THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON ENDING CHILD POVERTY -- OF WHICH DIAPER NEED IS OFTEN A HITTING CONSEQUENCE SO THE NATIONAL DIAPER BANK IS PROUD TO SUPPORT YOUR AB -- TWENTY FOUR AS PART OF THAT BOLD INITIATIVES SUCH AS AB TWENTY FOUR NAVY -- SIXTY SIX WILL REALLY HELP STRUGGLING FAMILIES LIVING A PARTY BE ABLE TO SECURE THE BASIC NECESSITIES LIKE DIAPERS REQUIRED FOR THEIR CHILDREN TO THRIVE -- ACCORDING TO THE STUDY REFERENCED EARLIER THAT WE CONDUCTED WITH IT AND PARTNERSHIP WITH RESEARCHERS AT YALE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE ONE IN THREE FAMILY STRUGGLE TO PROVIDE ENOUGH DIAPERS TO KEEP THEIR BABY. CLEAN DRY AND HEALTHY AND SO THIS IS WHAT IS KNOWN AS AS DIAPER NEED AND AS NORA -- MENTIONED EARLIER PARENTS OFTEN HAVE TO TAKE ACTIONS TO PROLONG -- THEIR USE OF DISPOSABLE DIAPERS AND THESE ACTIONS BORN OUT OF UNFORTUNATE NECESSITY CAN LEAD TO DIAPER DERMATITIS URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS AND OTHER CONDITIONS -- THAT MAY REQUIRE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE AND EXPENSES -- DIAPERS ARE REALLY TRULY HAVE A BASIC NECESSITY AND SO BY EXEMPTING DIAPERS FROM THE SALES TAX. AB SIXTY SIX LINES OF CALIFORNIA'S BROADER SALES TAX POLICY BUT REALLY MORE IMPORTANTLY THIS BILL PUTS MONEY BACK INTO THE POCKETS OF ALL FAMILIES. HELPING THEM BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR CHILDREN AND GIVING THEM EXTRA MONEY TO INVEST IN THEIR CHILD'S FUTURE AND THAT'S WHAT WE REALLY SEE IS SO IMPORTANT HERE. AS THE NATIONAL DEBT -- NATIONAL NETWORK WE ALSO SEE THE IMPACT THAT THIS BILL COULD NOT ONLY HAVING CALIFORNIA BUT REALLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY -- CALIFORNIA IS A POLICY LEADER AND A TREND SETTERS SO WHAT HAPPENS HERE IN THESE HALLS. THE CHANGES ARE THE CONVERSATIONS HAPPENING IN DC AND ANOTHER STATE LEGISLATURES AND WE'VE REALLY SEEN THAT HAPPENING -- FOR INSTANCE WITH THE COW WORKS -- STIPEND FOR DIAPERS CONNECTICUT IS WORKING ON IMPLEMENTING A VERY SIMILAR THING IN THIS DIRECTOR BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT'S HAPPENED HERE -- AND SO BY PASSING THIS LEGISLATION WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA CAN CONTINUE TO SEVEN EXAMPLE FOR THE REST THE COUNTRY. PAVE THE WAY FOR MORE STATES TO INVEST IN ENDING DIAPER NEED -- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME CONSIDERATION I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU EDITION OF WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IMMENSELY. REBEKAH GONZALEZ NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER IN STRONG SUPPORT. HERE MARIN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA GROWERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. JUST BIRTH LOW WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT. CLEAR LIP SHILTS NATIONAL COUNCIL OF JEWISH WOMEN IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SCENE NINE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. DR -- THIS IS AN HONEST QUESTION SO I WAS THE OLDEST TO SEVEN RAISED IN THE FIFTIES AND FORTIES -- AND WE HAD CLOTH DIAPERS ARE THOSE NOT -- REALLY AVAILABLE ANYMORE. SO AT DARK CLOTH DIAPERS AND MOST PEOPLE USE THE MUSEUM THROUGH SERVICES ARE A COUPLE PROBLEMS WITH CLOTH DIAPERS FOR COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE AND EVEN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE UPPER AND MIDDLE CLASS ONE IS THE CHILD CARE FACILITIES DON'T ACCEPT CLOTH DIAPERS. I'M OBVIOUSLY ONCE SOIL THERE US. RIGHT TO TELL YOU AS A TAX RATE THEY ARE TOXIC WASTE AND SO -- CHILD CARE FACILITIES DON'T ACCEPT THEM AS A USABLE FORM THE OTHER THING THAT PEOPLE DON'T THINK ABOUT A LOT -- I HAVE COMMUNITY THAT RELIES HEAVILY ON LAUNDROMATS IN LAUNDROMATS ACTUALLY YOU CANNOT USE CLOTH DIAPERS YOU CAN'T WATCH THEM IN LAUNDROMATS AND NOW THAT WE'VE GONE TO LOW FLOW TOILETS WHAT USED TO HAPPEN I MEAN I'M SORRY GET SO IN DEPTH BUT LIKE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS. IS I TORN SO WHAT USED TO HAPPEN LIKE WHEN MY MY MOTHER USED TO AYE. DIAPERS AND SHE SAID SHE'D FIRST WATCHED AMOUNT THE TOILET AND GO OUTSIDE AND WE AND I WATCHED HIM I GOT A LOT ABOUT MUCH THEM -- SO BECAUSE WE'VE WE SWITCH TO LOW FOR TOILETS THAT'S NOT EVEN A VERY EFFECTIVE WAY TO CLEAN DIAPERS ALLEN HAS A PRE WASH. AND SO IT IT REALLY LEAVES -- OF MOST COMMUNITIES WHO CAN'T AFFORD AN ACTUAL DIAPER SERVICE FROM BEING ABLE TO USE OUR RELY ON CLOTH DIAPERS ALL OKAY. GREAT AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS -- IT'S IN THE ANALYSIS SO FOR EXAMPLE THE POOR WOMAN WHO HAD A CHILD WHO KEPT THE SAME DIAPER FOR DAYS AT A TIME. NEEDS A LOT MORE THAN A 10% DISCOUNT. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T NEED THAT DISCOUNT IT ALL. UP YOU'VE MENTIONED THE CREDIT ON NOW CAO WORKS. WOULD IT MAKE MORE SENSE TO SPEND THIS MONEY TARGETED SAY THROUGH EITHER MEDI CAL OR CAO FRESH OR SOME OTHER -- PROGRAM -- I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THAT SO YOU PROBABLY HAVE AN ANSWER FOR ME I DO KNOW FIRST OF ALL CAL FRESH WE CAN'T USE -- WE CAN'T USE FOOD STAMPS UNFORTUNATELY TO BUY DIAPERS ARE WAY UP WE'VE GONE THROUGH ALL OF THESE. THESE POSSIBILITIES EVEN THROUGH -- CAL WORKS IT'S A DIFFICULT SITUATION BECAUSE NUMBER ONE THE MOUNT OF TIME THAT SOMEBODY'S ON CAL WORKS. DESPITE HOW LONG THAT THEY NEED TO BE IN THAT CHILD NEEDS TO BE IN DIAPERS ALSO THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON CAL WORKS SO. CHILDREN -- BEING BORN INTO POVERTY IN CALIFORNIA A LARGE NUMBER OF THEM ARE NOT -- ON CAL WORKS THERE IS AT A DISPARITY BETWEEN THAT IN SOMETHING LIKE DIAPER NEED THAT IS SO COSTLY SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A HUNDRED TO TWO HOW A HUNDRED DOLLARS MINIMUM A YEAR PER FAMILY. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS IN CAN BENEFIT FAR MORE THAN JUST -- POOR WORKING CLASS AND LOWER MIDDLE CLASS I MEAN THAT'S GETTING INTO THE RANGE THAT REALLY DOES ALLEVIATE STRESS OFF OF MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES. AND SO WHATWE FIND IS THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO SUPPORT AND I I WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH -- DIAPER BANKS AND AND CAL WORKS PROPOSALS AND OTHER WAYS TO GET DIAPERS IN THE HANDS OF POOR POOR MOMS. IMPORT MANLEY'S -- BUT IN PARTICULAR MOMS BUT IN REALITY WE'RE NOT THE TO REACH THE NEED THAT WE NEED -- TO ULTIMATELY WE WE WE SHOULD ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THE COSTA DIAPERS -- I'M NOT QUITE THERE YET I PROMISE YOU ALL GET THERE -- BUT THIS IS ONE ONE EASY THING WE CAN DO I WAS TRYING MY HARDEST TO FIND THE NUMBER OF KIDS WHO ARE BORN TO WEALTHY FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA I CAN'T SEEM TO FIND THAT NUMBER. BUT WHAT WE DO NOW IS THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN WHO ARE BORN ON MEDI CAL IS WAY OVER 50% THAT THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN BORN INTO POVERTY ESPECIALLY BLACK AND BROWN CHILDREN. IT IS CLOSER TO TWO THIRDS IN SO IF YOU ADD THAT ON TOP OF MIDDLE CLASS YOU'RE YOU'RE GONNA GET -- REALLY. AFFECTING FAMILIES WHO ARE THEIR MOST CRITICAL TIME HER USING THE MOST VULNERABLE TIME OF THEIR COSTS ARE THE HIGHEST IN THESE NEEDS ARE THE GREATEST AND BY THE WAY THIS IS. A NEED THAT CAMP -- BE FOR FILLED IN ANY OTHER WAY SO I AYE IF THERE WAS A WAY TO EXEMPT RICH PEOPLE I MEAN SURE I'D DO IT -- BUT I I CAN'T SEE A FUNCTIONAL WAY TO GET THIS TYPE OF RELIEF AND THE AMOUNT OF FAMILIES HANDS THAT WE NEEDED TO GET INTO WITHOUT DEALING WITH IT AGAIN AT ANOTHER WAY EXCEPT THROUGH. THE THE REGRESSIVE NATURE OF SALES TAX OKAY -- IS THERE ANY WAY TO DO THROUGH MEDI CAL. MEDI CAL SO. YOU WERE ELIGIBLE MIGHT ALSO GET A VOUCHER FOR A CERTAIN NUMBER OF DIAPERS WE WE WENT THAT ROUTE. ORIGINALLY THIS WAS. FIVE YEARS AGO WAS TALKED OUT OF IT BY THE BY NOW SENATOR PAN AND I'M I'M SORRY I CAN'T COME UP WITH A SPECIFIC REASON OKAY -- BUT IT IT THERE WAS A REASON BY WHICH WE SHOULDN'T HAVE USE MEDI CAL WOULD PUT IN JEOPARDY I THINK OUR NATIONAL FUNDING. AND SOME OTHER IN HE IS A PEDIATRICIAN WHO SPECIALIZES IN COMMENTS SO -- HE WAS LIKE THE PERFECT PERSON FOR ME TO ABOUT MY INITIALTHOUGHTS TO BOUNCE OFF OF BUT HE DEFINITELY TALKED ME OUT OF THE MEDI CAL ROUTE AND I'M SORRY CAM I'LL GET YOU THE SPECIFICS ON WHY THERE WAS A A SPECIFIC REASON HE THOUGHT THAT THAT WOULD WORK. THANKS IT'S VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ALL RIGHT UP FOR A SEVEN MEMBER. TO REALLY BE A HAPPY TO CO AUTHOR YOUR BILL. LOW QUICK QUESTION THOUGH IS WOULD YOU CONSIDER -- EXAM TO THE DIAPERS FULL ADULT. THANK YOU -- IS VOTE BOOK OLDER OLDER YEAH. I DID CALL DAY OR PROBABLY ALSO IN THE DIRE NEED FOR GUESTS OF DIAPERS SERVICES SO IF YOU DON'T I'LL CARRY A BILL NEXT YEAR -- AND I'D BE HAPPY TO CO AUTHOR THIS WITH YOU THE REASON I HAVE NOT TAKEN ON THE ADULT DIAPER ISSUE IS ACTUALLY THROUGH. MEDICARE ADULT DIAPERS YOU CAN GET A PRESCRIPTION FOR ADULT DIAPERS AND THEN THEY ARE TAX FREE. AND SO THERE IS A MECHANISM CURRENTLY BY WHICH ADULTS WHO ARE IN CON IT CAN GET TAX FREE DIAPERS WHICH IS KIND OF IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT -- IT SHOWS THE DISPARITY IN THE WAY WE ADDRESS THAT THERE IS NO WAY TO DO IT OF COURSE THROUGH THE YOUNGER CHILD BUT AS AS YOU AGE. THERE IS A PRESCRIPTION. I HAVE BEEN TOLD THOUGH THAT THOSE DIAPERS AREN'T AS NICE AS THE ONES YOU BUY OVER THE COUNTER AND SO WE MAY STILL WANT TO TACKLE THIS ISSUE. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE -- SO YOU AYE I'VE TALKED TO YOUR STAFF A LOTABOUT THIS AND WE SPENT SOME TIME WITH CD TFA AND FIRST THANK YOU BOTH FOR EVERYTHING YOU DO WITH THE DIAPER BANK AND WITH YOUR SERVICES. CLEARLY TO MY COMMUNITY -- AND WE DID TALK TO CD TO A FAN WE TRIED TO FIND A WAY TO MEANS TEST THIS AND THEY DID THINK THEY HAD AN IDEA THE PROBLEM IS THEY COULDN'T AUDIT THE BUSINESSES. AND AT ONE POINT I WAS LIKE WHO CARES BUT I KNOW HOW HARD YOU WORK ON THIS AND THERE'S A LARGE NUMBER OF THE MEMBERS ON THIS COMMITTEE WHO HAVE WRITTEN A LETTER TO BUDGET TO SUPPORT SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS. YOU HAVE DONE AN INCREASING YOUR CAL WORKS BILL FROM THIRTY TO FIFTY DOLLARS AND TO INCREASE AND TO DO ANOTHER BUDGET ALLOCATION TO DIAPER BANKS. AND PART OF THE REASON I ENCOURAGE THEM TO DO THAT IS BECAUSE I STRUGGLE WITH THIS A LITTLE BIT EVEN AS A MOM WHO JUST WHO HAS A VERY YOUNG CHILD -- I WORRYING BECAUSE THEY DO WORK AT I AM SPENDING SO MUCH TIME WORKING ON POVERTY AND THE WAY THAT THIS -- COMMITTEE HAS BEEN LOOKING AT THINGS THIS YEAR AS WE LOOK VERY CAREFULLY AT ANYTHING THAT TAKES MONEY OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND. AND SO FOR ME THE STRUGGLE WAS DO WE ALLOW WEALTHY PEOPLE WHO BUY DESIGNER ORGANIC HONEST DIAPERS -- A SALES TAX EXEMPTION DOES THAT TAKE IS THAT FAIR TO THOSE PEOPLE THAT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THAT MONEY OUT OF THEIR PROGRAMS THEIR OTHER PRODUCTS ALSO PROGRAMS. HERE'S WHAT I KNOW. I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE WORKED VERY VERY HARD ON THIS. I KNOW THIS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO YOU. AND SO I HAVE ASKED YOU TO TAKE SOME AMENDMENTS TO HAVE THIS REVIEWED BY THE LA -- TO SEE IF THIS IS REALLY THE MOST SUCCESSFUL THING THAT WE CAN DO FOR FAMILIES -- BUT I HAVE EVERY I'VE ALWAYS TOLD YOU THAT I HAVE EVERY INTENTION OF SUPPORTING YOU WITH THIS I'VE TOLD YOU THAT IN EVERY ITERATION THAT THIS IS COME TO THIS COMMITTEE WHETHER IT WAS A TRYING TO GET THE MONEY THROUGH AN ALCOHOL TAX OR WHATEVER I'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT. I HAD EVERY INTENTION OF SUPPORTING YOU WITH THIS HOWEVER I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE IT'S THE RIGHT THING THAT WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT THERE ISN'T ANOTHER DELIVERY MECHANISM TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE ARE TRULY GETTING DOING EXACTLY WHAT IT IS I KNOW YOU WANT TO DO AND THAT IS THE ONLY GOAL THAT I HAVE OF THIS BILL. WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE SURE I WOULD JUST -- YOU KNOW AND I I A THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH US AND I AM HAPPY TO TAKE THOSE AMENDMENTS -- ONE NOT HAPPY EVEN TAKE THEM. THAT'S HOW AMENDMENTS GO IN THIS BUILDING RIGHT -- SO. I WOULD JUST SAY THIS YEAH I I UNDERSTAND AND WE HAVE LOOKED AT THIS TEN WAYS -- TO TRY TO GET TO THE A MEANS TEST I'M IT'S JUST NOT HOW SALES TAX WORKS QUITE FRANKLY YOU KNOW UNLESS. WE WANT TO EXEMPTS ORGANIC EXPENSIVE DIAPERS THAT YOU NOW ARE OUT OF MAYBE A CERTAIN RANGE -- I THINK WE COULD DO THAT BUT IS I I THINK THAT WOULD BE PROBLEMATIC IN OTHER WAYS -- THE FACT IS THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S ANOTHER DISCUSSION GOING ON AND ONE THAT I FULLY SUPPORT ABOUT TAMPON TAX. AND WE'VE MOVED OUT FOR TIME AND TIME AGAIN SAYING YOU KNOW THIS IS UNFAIR TO WOMEN IT IS -- IT'S A SMALL AMOUNT -- THAT IS MORE BASED ON EQUITY THAN IT IS ON ACTUAL COST BECAUSE THE COST OF OF OF COURSE I'M FEMININE HYGIENE PRODUCTS IS TOO HIGH AS WELL. BUT THE THE TAXES IS SMALL BY COMPARISON OF COURSE WE HAVE PAID OVER THE COURSE OF OUR LIFETIME NOT JUST THAT YOURS OUR CHILDREN ARE YOUNG. HOWEVER -- THAT HAS BEEN ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITHOUT A DISCUSSION ABOUT MEANS TESTING OR ABOUT POVERTY AND I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW BECAUSE I THINK -- YOU KNOW WHEN WE LOOK AT TAXES IN THE REGRESSIVE NATURE OF ALL TAXES IN THE FAIRNESS AROUND ALL TAXES QUITE FRANKLY THE DIAPER TAX IS NOT THAT DIFFERENT IN SOME WAYS I I WOULD ARGUE THAT THERE IS A POLICY -- DISCUSSION AROUND WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY GETTING OUT OF THE MOUNT OF MONEY THAT IS SAVED IN A DIAPER TAX I'D BE HAPPY TO LOOK AT ADDITIONAL TAXES ON THE WEALTHY THAT HAVE CHILDREN AS A FORM OF RECOUPING THE COST I'VE NAY I'M NOT ONE THAT'S THAT SHIES AWAY FROM. YOU KNOW THAT TAXING FOLKS TO PAY FOR FOR WORTHWHILE PROJECTS THAT THEY COULD THEY ARE REPORT PROPOSALS SO THEY COULD PAY IN ANOTHER WAY AND I'D BE HAPPY TO LOOK AT ANY -- ANYTHING THAT THAT ANY ORGANIZATION COMES UP WITH AS WAY TO MEANS TEST IT. WHAT I DON'T WANT THOUGH AND I'LL BE CLEAR IS I DON'T WANT% PEOPLE TO HAVE TO SHOW -- THAT THEY'RE ON WELFARE IN ORDER TO GET A TAX EXEMPTION YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT IT GOES BEYOND THAT I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE TO SHOW -- THAT THEIR POOR I IT YOU KNOW I I'M A LITTLE SENSITIVE TO TO THAT ISSUE AS WELL -- AND I DON'T WANT IT TO BE A SITUATION THAT DOESN'T ALSO ENCOMPASS -- ARE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS IN OUR MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES THAT ARE STRUGGLING WITH THE SAME ISSUE THAT SO MANY OF OUR OUR POOR FAMILIES ARE STRUGGLING IT'S EXPENSIVE TO HAVE CHILDREN. IT'S USUALLY YOUNGER FOLKS NOT ALWAYS BUT YOUNGER FOLKS WERE THERE STARTED THEIR CAREER WHO OFTEN ARE YOU ARE SINGLE MOMS WHO ARE OFTEN TRYING TO PIECE IT ALL TOGETHER. AN EXORBITANT NATURE OF THE DIAPER TAX I WOULD ARGUE IS SO UNIQUE AND NO OTHER TAX GOING OF THAT YOU COULD ADDED UP AND PROVIDE A FULL MONTH'S SUPPLY OF DIAPERS WHICH WHICH WE KNOW THAT MONEY IS DEFINITELY GOING TOWARDS. IF THERE IS A WAY TO BALANCE THAT OUT WITH -- WITH ENSURING THAT THAT WEALTHY PEOPLE DON'T BENEFIT UNNECESSARILY FROM THIS I WOULD BE HAPPY TO LOOK AT IT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN ENCOMPASS. THE MOST AMOUNT OF FAMILIES POSSIBLE THAT REALLY DO DEAL WITH US AS INITIAL. I'M TRYING TO DECIDE LET'S SAY SOME. YOU KNOW IT'S OKAY IT'S A GOOD POLICY DISCUSSION YOU BECAUSE I I READ THE NOW SAYS ON TAMPON TAX AND I'VE GONE ROUND AND ROUND WITH MY OWN STUFF AND IT'S LIKE I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY. WHY -- EXCEPT THAT THERE IS AN ADDICT IT COSTS MORE BECAUSE THE SAVINGS IS MORE -- BUT BUT WHY SOME SALES TAX WE WOULD LOOK AT AS A MEANS TEST AND OTHERS WE WOULDN'T WE WE GOT ALL SALES TAX IT'S MEANS TESTED WHICH I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S RIGHT AND AND QUITE AND QUITE HONESTLY I DIDN'T WANT TO DO THAT BUT I DON'T SEE IT. IN MY OPINION I DON'T SEE THE SAME THING THE SET FOR ME THE TAMPON TAX IN THIS DO AREN'T THE EXACT SAME THING. AND I AND WE ASK THE SAME QUESTIONS OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA AND THE REALITY IS IS TO ME. I CAN'T HELP I MEAN I REALLY HATE GOING I HATE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION AND COMMITTEE BECAUSE I'M NOT ONE TO TALK ABOUT -- NO THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU THIS IS ABOUT MY OWN PERSONAL DESIRE NOT TO TALK ABOUT TAMPONS -- BUT I DON'T NECESSARILY I DO FEEL LIKE IT'S A NECESSITY TO I I MEAN I HAVE MY BEARD EVERY MONTH THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO TO STOP THAT THAT IS A NECESSITY WHEREAS. I LOVE HAVING MY CHILD MY CHILD IS EVERYTHING THERE'S NOT A PERSON IN THIS ROOM WHO DOESN'T KNOW HOW MUCH I WORSHIP MY CHILD. BUT IT'S NOT A REQUIREMENT FOR ME TO HAVE HER IN SO I WONDER I WORRY SOMETIMES. IF HOW WE QUALIFY THE WORD NECESSITY AND I GUESS AND ONCE YOU HAVE A CHILD YES A DIAPER I BELIEVE IT IS A NECESSITY. BUT A STRUGGLE WITH THAT AND THAT'S AND THAT WAS WHY THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE IN PART THAT WAS WHY IN MY ANNOUNCED IN THE ANNOUNCES IN IN THE CONVERSATION IT WAS DIFFERENT. I DID NOT PUSH YOU LIKE I PUSHED ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA ASKED WHAT THE GOALS WERE BECAUSE I'VE SPENT ENOUGH TIME WITH YOU TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AND I KNOW WHAT YOUR GOAL IS. BUT I STILL I DO QUESTION A FOR GETTING TO THE RIGHT WAY AND I KNOW IT'S BEEN A STRUGGLE WHICH IS WHY THE AMENDMENTS ARE THE WAY THEY ARE. IT'S A WIDE IT IS EXACTLY THEY'RE DESIGNED NOT TO HURT THIS BILL BUT THEY'RE DESIGNED TO MAKE SURE THAT OVER TIME IT THIS IS NOT THE CORRECT ANSWER AND WE FIND ANOTHER ANSWER AND THERE IS A WAY TO MEANS TEST SEIZE OR ANYTHING ELSE. THAT WE HAVE THE OPTION TO DO THAT AND SO. THESE AMENDMENTS ARGUED WITH THE GOAL TO SEE YOU SUCCEED BECAUSE THAT HAS BEEN MY GOAL BUT THEY DON'T NECESSARILY SEE THE TOOL BILLS IS THE SAME BUT I DO SEE THE GOAL IS ONE YOU BOTH TO SUCCEED. AND BELIEVING THAT YOU BOTH HAVE A POINT ON SOME LEVEL IN YOUR POLICY AND SO BE IT SO I JUST WANNA MAKE I'M SURE I'M CLEAR. THAT THAT THE GOAL HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO SEE YOU SUCCEED BUT I DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE ON ALL OF YOUR REASONING A TIME TO GET AND THAT'S IT. AND I I RESPECTFULLY AYE AYE I THINK THAT IS A GREAT POINT OF DISCUSSION I IT I A I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE ON SOME OF THIS I MEAN THERE ARE THERE ARE. I I THINK CHILD BIRTH UNFORTUNATELY IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN ALWAYS BE AVOIDED AT ACT. IT'S I'M. ALL RIGHT SO IT'S A NATURAL PART OF THE HUMAN EXISTENCE IN LIFE AND SO I DON'TWANT TO DEVALUE -- CHILDBIRTH IS A PART OF OF A A MANY [inaudible] PEOPLE'S [inaudible] NATURAL. FORM OF LIFE SO I I GUESS WE WILL JUST. HAVE TO DISAGREE ON THAT PORTION OF IT OF COURSE -- BUT A I THINK WE COULD BOTH AGREE THAT A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE TAX FREE THEY'RE A LOT MORE CHOICE STERN AND SO [inaudible] ABSOLUTELY. ASSEMBLYMEMBER ON A QUICK -- QUESTION HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THE POSSIBILITY OF GIVING AND SEND IT TO THE MANUFACTURERS TO BE ABLE TO DONATE TO ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THIS AND PROVIDED TO THE PEOPLE FOR FREE. BUT ACTUALLY IT IS AS IT WAS STARTED BY HUGGIES THE NATIONAL DIAPER NETWORK IMPACT WE DO HAVE A LOT OF INCENTIVES -- TO DONATE TOWARDS DIAPER BANKS -- AND AND THE DIAPER COMPANIES ACTUALLY DO A LOT OF THAT AD THEY NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW YEAH I MEAN IT'S JUST STILL AND AN EVER INCREASING NEED I MEAN I I OVERALL AND THIS IS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT DISCUSSION BUT I THINK WE SHOULD. ASK WHY OUR DIAPERS AND FEMININE HYGIENE PRODUCTS SO EXPENSIVE -- BECAUSE IT IS A NEED AND SOMEHOW -- MANUFACTURES HAVE FOUND A WAY TO CHARGE A LOT FOR THOSE I THINK THAT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DISCUSSION WE CAN HAVE BUT THE MANUFACTURERS HAVE -- AT LEAST BEEN VERY POSITIVE AND THEY EVEN ALLOW LIKE FOOD BANKS TO BUY IN BULK AT DISCOUNTED RATES SO THAT'S WHEN THE REASONS WE WENT THE FOOD BANK ROUTE. UNFORTUNATELY WE ALL KNOW THAT WE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO DELIVER ENOUGH TO THE FOOD BANK'S THROUGH CAL WORKS ACTUALLY AFFECT ALL THE FOLKS WHO ARE IN NEED AND WHO STRUGGLE WITH US IT'S JUST. NOT FEASIBLE -- WORKING FAMILIES ARE GONNA ALL YOU UTILIZE THOSE RESOURCES AND SOMETIMES CAN'T BECAUSE OF INCOME QUALIFICATIONS. I THINK YOU CLOSE BUDGET LIKE CLOSE AGAIN. NOW JUST -- I I OBVIOUSLY RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY BUT WHEN THIS COMES UP THANK YOU. MOVING FILE ITEM ELEVEN A. B. FIFTEEN SIXTY NINE ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME OUT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. HE'S ALWAYS GREAT. I LEARNED SO MUCH WHEN I COME TO YOUR COMMITTEE. DIAPERS ADULT DIAPERS AND EVERYTHING ELSE. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AB FIFTEEN SIXTY NINE WILL INCREASE ACCESS TO MEDICAL CANNABIS PRODUCTS FOR DISABLED VETERANS. VETERANS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY HEALTH ISSUES LIKE CHRONIC PAIN AND POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER FOLLOWING TO SERVICE CURRENTLY VETERANS LACKS ADEQUATE ACCESS TO MEDICAL CANNABIS TO TREAT. THESE CONDITIONS AND VETERANS OUT HEAVILY RELY RELY ON OPIATES. THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT THE US DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS TREATS CANNABIS AS AN ILLEGAL SUBSTANCE AND PROHIBITS VA DOCTORS FROM RECOMMENDING CANNABIS TO VETERANS. THE VA ALSO DOES NOT PROVIDE REIMBURSEMENTS FOR MEDICAL CANNABIS PRODUCTS PURCHASED BY VETERANS FURTHERMORE THE MEDICAL CANNABIS PROGRAM -- IS CURRENTLY UNDER UTILIZED BY VETERANS BECAUSE MANY OF THEM FEAR LOSING THEIR FEDERAL HEALTH BENEFITS IF THEY ARE IDENTIFIED AS BEING CANNABIS USERS ON A GOVERNMENT LIST. AB FIFTEEN SIXTY NINE WOULD ALLOW DIS. VETERANS TO RECEIVED A SALES TAX EXEMPTION AFFORDED TO MEDICAL CANNABIS CARD HOLDERS BY PROVIDING A VETERANS HEALTH IDENTIFICATION CARD THAT SHOWS THEIR DISABILITY STATUS AT A DISPENSARY. IN DOING SO THIS BILL WILL ENCOURAGE VETERANS TO BUY FROM ILLEGAL CANNABIS MARKET AND CONTINUE. TO LARGER EFFORTS TO HELP VETERANS GET OFF ADDICTIVE PRESCRIBED OPIOIDS. TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE I HAVE WITH ME TODAY. CASEY O'CONNOR REPRESENTING STATE TREASURER BEYOND A MALL. AND ERIN AUGUSTA'S WITH VETERANS CANNABIS GROUP MEMBERS ARE EXPECTED AFTER GUY VOTE. HI MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M CASEY O'CONNOR LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR STATE TREASURER FIONA MOCK PROUD CO SPONSOR OF THIS MEASURE WE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR. AND THE VETERANS THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH ON THIS WHEN THE TREASURER WAS AT THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION SHE WAS VERY INVOLVED IN ILLEGAL CANNABIS ISSUES AS A COLLECTOR OF THE TAXES AT THAT TIME. AND WE CAN BRING CONVENE A WORKING GROUP TO DISCUSS ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BY THE LEGISLATURE. IN THESE DISCUSSIONS WE LEARNED THAT VETERANS WERE NOT REALLY UTILIZING THE MEDICAL CAMPUS CAMPUS MARKET WE WANTED TO WORK ON A WAY TO BRING MORE INTO THEIR LEGAL REGULATED MARKET. THEY CAN RELY LESS ON HARMFUL OPIOIDS ARE CURRENTLY BEING PRESCRIBED TO OUR VETERANS WE KNOW THAT TWENTY TWO VETERANS A DAY ARE COMMITTING SUICIDE. AND WE KNOW THAT IS 21% HIGHER THAN OTHER ADULTS IN THE U. S. THIS IS A TRAVESTY IN THE STATE NEEDS TO DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. WE WANTED TO FIND A WAY TO ENSURE THAT VETERANS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAL CARDS COULD RECEIVE THE SAME BENEFITS OF THE CARD WHILE ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS WE WERE HEARING FROM VETERANS. AND AB FIFTEEN SIXTY NINE IS A CULMINATION OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS. A RECOVERY FIRST STUDY STATES THAT NOT ONLY ARE VETERANS WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND CHRONIC PAIN PROBLEMS MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. BUT THAT THE COMBINATION OF OPIOIDS AND SEDATIVES PUTS THE MEN INCREASED RISK OF ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSES WE ALSO FOUND THE STUDY THAT OPIOIDS ARE TIED TO AN EIGHT TIMES HIGHER RISK OF DEATH FOR FEMALE VETERANS. BETWEEN TWENTY TEN TWENTY FIFTEEN OPIOID ABUSE AND ADDICTION AMONG VETERANS ROSE ABOUT 55% WITH ABOUT SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND VETERANS OR 13% OF THAT POPULATION ABUSING OPIOIDS. THE CENTER FOR INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING UNDER THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT INDICATED THAT FROM. 220-004-2000 TWELVE SEVEN POINT 7% OF VA PATIENTS WERE ON TAKE HOME OPIOIDS BY THE TWENTY TWELVE TWENTY TWELVE FISCAL YEAR AND TWENTY FOURTEEN THE AGENCY CLAIM TO HAVE ISSUED ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION OPIOID PRESCRIPTIONS. 240-040-3000 VETERANS WHO SHOWED UP AT IT'S A HUNDRED FORTY THREE MEDICAL FACILITIES FOR OUTPATIENT CARE -- I ALSO WANT TO ADDRESS IF YOU WOULD LET ME SOME OF THE OUR RESPONSES TO THE COMMITTEE NOW SAYS CONCERNS -- FIRST AND FOREMOST WE WANT ADDRESSED THE ISSUE OF THE SHRINKING SALES AND USE TAX MARKET. VETERANS ARE CURRENTLY NOT PREVALENT IN THE MEDICAL CANNABIS FACE ANY ADDITIONAL PRESSURES THAT BY THIS LANGUAGE WOULD BE OFFSET BY HAVING A NEW CONSUMER BASE. THE ALREADY IS SUPPOSED TO BE INCLUDED IN THAT MARKET. SINCE WE'RE HEARING FROM VETERANS THAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY NOT PARTICIPATING IN THE MEDICAL CARD SPACE WE KNOW CALIFORNIA IS RECEIVING NO SALES TAX OR THE RELATED CULTIVATION OR EXCISE TAX ON THOSE PRODUCTS. SO BY INCLUDING THEM IN THIS. THIS BILL WOULD ACTUALLY BRING IN TWO OUT OF THREE OF THOSE TAXES AS OPPOSED AS YOU'RE OUT OF THREE SINCE ARE CURRENTLY NOT USING THAT MEDICAL CARD -- FURTHERMORE THE US DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS -- AS ANY ANALYSIS THE WEBSITE STATES THAT THE VA PARTICIPATION IN STATE MARIJUANA PROGRAMS DOES NOT AFFECT ELIGIBILITY FOR THE VA CARD SERVICES. MORE OVER THE VA NOTES THAT -- VA PROVIDERS CAN CAN AND DO DISCUSS MARIJUANA USE WITH VETERANS AS PART OF COMPREHENSIVE CARE PLANNING -- CANNABIS IS STILL A SCHEDULE ONE DRUG AS SUCH THE VA DOCTORS CANNOT PRESCRIBE MEDICAL CANNABIS EVEN THOUGH THEY CAN'T DISCUSS. OF MARIJUANA AND ITS BENEFITS. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE POLICY BY THE VA IS JUST THAT IT'S A POLICY IT'S NOT MANDATED. AND SO THIS COULD BE CHANGE BASED ON THE WHIMS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN ACTIVELY WORKING TO ENSURE OUR STATE'S POLICIES PROVIDE PROTECTION WHERE WE CAN FOR THE LEGAL CANNABIS MARKET IN OUR STATE GIVE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S VOLATILE GIVEN THE FEDERAL. GOVERNMENT VOLATILE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ISSUE AB FIFTEEN SIXTY NINE INSURERS VETERANS ARE NOT NEGATIVELY IMPACT SHOULD A CHANGE IN VA POLICY OCCUR AND ADDRESSES THE VETERANS CONCERNS. AND THEN I ALSO HAVE SOME INFORMATION ON PENDING. LEGISLATION AND STATES IN AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND THERE ALSO IS A CAR. A COURT CASE IN NEVADA AS WELL AS A SUPREME COURT CASE ON THIS ISSUE SO THAT'S WHY WE FEEL IT IS APPROPRIATE AND NECESSARY FOR CALIFORNIA TO ACT. TO ENSURE THAT OUR VETERANS HAVE THE ACCESS THEY NEED TO THIS AND SO I JUST WANT TO TURN MY TURN OVER TO ERIN AUGUSTA'S. A VETERAN HERE FOR THE VETERANS CANNABIS GROUP BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU MY NAME IS ERIN A JUSTICE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE VETERANS CANNABIS GROUP IN MARIN COUNTY. OUR ADVOCACY GROUP OF VETERANS USE MEDICINAL CANNABIS -- TO TREAT THE SYMPTOMS OF COMBAT RELATED PTSD AND OTHER MEDICAL ISSUES -- AFTER RETURNING HOME FROM IRAQ IN TWO THOUSAND THREE I UNDERSTOOD ME TO THE TRANSITION FROM MILITARY LIFE TO CIVILIAN LIFE. AND I FOUND THAT MEDICAL CANNABIS HELPED CALM ME DOWN AND ACTUALLY BRING MY MIND INTO THE PRESENT -- VETERANS WHO HAVE A SERVICE CONNECTED DISABILITY RATING. I HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE VA TO GET EVALUATED AND THEN YOU GET YOUR MEDICAL ID CARD AND IT STATES IF YOU ARE A SERVICE CONNECTED DISABLED VETERAN. SO THERE IS A THIRD PARTY EVALUATOR THAT'S ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH THIS WHICH IS THE V. -- EIGHT MANY VETERANS RECEIVE VA VA COMPENSATION FOR THEIR DISABILITIES ARE ON FIXED INCOME. AND THE ADDITIONAL COST OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE MEDICAL ID CARD IS JUST ANOTHER FINANCIAL BURDEN -- THAT MAKES IT HARDER FOR VETERANS TO ACCESS MEDICAL CANNABIS. I ONE THING ABOUT THE VA IS THE VA DOCTORS WILL NOT BRING IT UP UNLESS THE VETERAN BRINGS IT UP THEMSELVES -- SO EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE A A POLICY IT'S IT'S LIKE YOU SAID IT'S NOT MANDATED -- AND YOU HAVE TO BRING IT UP TO YOUR POSITION. FIRST -- SO I KNOW THAT A LOT OF VETERANS IN MY GROUP. ARE AFRAID OF LOSING THEIR VA BENEFITS. AND THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIALLY NOT BEING ABLE TO PURCHASE A FIREARM IN THE FUTURE IF ON A GOVERNMENT LISTS SUCH AS THE STATE MEDICAL ID CARD -- MEDICAL CANNABIS HELPS MANY VETERANS IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS INCLUDING GET OFF GETTING OFF OF OPIATES. THERE ARE CURRENTLY TWENTY TWO VETERANS COMMITTING SUICIDE EVERY DAY AND MEDICAL CANNABIS COULD POTENTIALLY SAVE SOME OF THEIR LIVES -- THANK YOU AGAIN FOR LISTENING THAT I RECOGNIZE URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON AB. FIFTEEN SIXTY NINE ADDITIONAL IN THIS IS IN SUPPORT. JOSH VIRGINIANS LOPING WHEN INCORPORATED -- PRESENT ENVELOPING WHEN I AM THE CHAIRPERSON FOR THE VETERANS ALLIANCE FOR GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY AND ALONG WITH -- G.

GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR COOPER WERE A MEMBER VETERANS CANNABIS GROUP SUPPORT ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTEEN SIXTY NINE THANK YOU. THANK YOU DITION WITNESSES IN SUPPORT SEEING NONE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. BRING IT BACK TO THE DÃ­AS MEMBERS WISHES. LENDERS -- THANK YOU SO. I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS -- YOU SAID THAT -- RELEASED THE AUTHOR STATES THAT VETERANS ARE CONCERNED THAT THEY WILL LOSE THEIR BENEFITS. IF IT'S FOUND THAT THEY ARE USING MARIJUANA IS AT RIGHT NOW I'M HERE FROM THE VETERANS. YES [inaudible] SO WHAT -- WHAT IS CAUSING YOU TO THINK YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE YOUR BENEFITS IF YOU USE? YOUR USED MARIJUANA I ASSUME RIGHT YEAH SO HAVE YOU LOST YOUR BUT YOUR VA BENEFITS NOW. SO THEN WHAT WOULD. WELL RITA SO IT'S EACH VÃ¬ Ã£ HAS OF AROUND DIRECTORS -- THAT ARE IN CHARGE OF THE VA HOSPITAL THERE. AND THE NOT ALL THE V. A.'S OPERATE THE SAME EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE A FEDERAL POLICIES OUT THERE -- BOSS BEING IT BEING IN CALIFORNIA BEING IN THIS STATE WE DO HAVE A MEDICAL STATE ID OR MEDICAL STATE MARIJUANA PROGRAM. WHICH HELPS WITH THE V. EIGHT WITH THE VETERANS BECAUSE THERE IS A POLICY -- TO TO FALL BACK ON SO IF YOU HAVE YOUR DOCTOR'S RECOMMENDATION -- FROM AND A DOCTOR OUTSIDE OF THE VA BECAUSE OF THE VA DOCTORS WILL NOT ISSUE. A DOCTOR'S RECOMMENDATION THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HELPS YOU -- BUT I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE A LOT OF VETERANS WHO HAVE. I PTSD OR OTHER TYPES OF MENTAL ISSUES WHERE THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT BEING ON A LIST -- THEY DON'T WANT TO YOU KNOW GET THE STATE ID CARD BECAUSE OF THIS FEAR. HER IF I MAY. YOU HAVEN'T LOST YOUR BENEFITS. RIGHT I'M ONE PERSON OUT OF THE TWO MILLION VETERANS IN CALIFORNIA CELLS. SO. DO YOU NEED IS THERE A NUMBER THAT YOU KNOW OF A VETERANS WHO HAVE LOST THEIR BENEFITS BECAUSE OF MARIJUANA USE MEDICAL MARIJUANA USE -- SO WE DON'T HAVE A NUMBER BUT THE REASON THAT THERE IS THIS FEAR IS BECAUSE THERE ARE COURT CASES PENDING SO IN -- AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL ROMAN VERSE WOULD OCCUR -- ROMAN ASSERTS THAT THE NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT GUN CONTROL ACT VIOLATES THE SECOND AMENDMENT AS WELL AS HIS FIFTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS AGAINST SELF INCRIMINATION. BECAUSE OF FEDERAL FIREARM TRANSACTION FORMS REQUIRE MEDICAL THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH. HAVING BE A BENEFIT. FOR YOU WHAT KIND OF GUN OWNERSHIP RIGHT BUT THEY'RE SAYING THAT WHEN THEY FILL OUT THEIR FORMS FOR THE GUNS IS AS MEDICAL MARIJUANA USERS TO REPORT ON IT REQUIRES AND REPORT THE USE OF DRUGS UNLAWFULLY EVEN WHEN IT IS LEGAL IN THEIR STATE. SO THEY'RE WORRIED THAT SINCE THAT FORM REQUIRES THEM TO EVEN THOUGH IT'S LEGAL IN CALIFORNIA THE FORM SAYS IT'S ILLEGAL FOR THEM TO USE THAT THEY'RE WORRIED THAT WHEN THEY'RE PULLING UP THAT FORM THEY'RE COMMITTING SOME SORT OF PERJURY IN THERE WHERE THAT'S GOING TO FACTOR BENEFITS. SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE A SAFETY MEASURE IN OUR STATE. OKAY I'M CONFUSED HOW WOULD THEY BE COMMITTING PERJURY IF THE ANSWER THE QUESTION HONESTLY. BECAUSE THERE IT'S LEGAL IN CALIFORNIA SO THEY THINK IT'S LEGAL FOR THEM TO USE IT BUT IT'S SAYING ON THIS FORM. THAT IT'S UNLAWFUL EVEN WHEN IT IS LEGAL IN THE STATE AND THEREFORE AUTOMATICALLY DISQUALIFIES THEM FROM THE APPLICATION PROCESS AGAIN I'M ASKING ABOUT VA BENEFITS I'M NOT ASKING ABOUT GUN OWNERSHIP. SO I DO KNOW WHAT I'M ASKING IS WHO HAS LOST THEIR VA BENEFITS BECAUSE OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA USE SO VETERANS THAT ARE IN OPIOID OR PAIN MEDICATION PROGRAMS. THOSE THOSE VETERANS IF THEY HAVE A URINALYSIS THAT HAS -- CANNABIS IN IT THEY ARE POTENTIALLY AT RISK FOR LOSING THAT THAT BENEFIT OKAY BUT VETERANS WHO ARE ON SOME SORT OF PAIN MANAGEMENT. THERAPY ARE NOT GIVEN A RANDOM URINALYSIS TO CHECK TO COULD VERY ON VERY BEING PRESCRIBED OPIOID SO THAT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE ANY SENSE SOME OF THIS A ARE ACTUALLY. WHEN THEY TAKE YOUR BLOOD THEY'LL THEY TEST EVERYTHING -- BUT THEY'RE NOT TESTING YOU FOR MARIJUANA. NOW I'M NOT ON THE ROOMS RIGHT. BECAUSE THEY DON'T DO THAT I'M [inaudible] SO. YOU ARE ASKING. I'M STILL TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. YOU DON'T YOU DON'T WANT. VETERANS TO HAVE TO GET THE STATE ISSUED MEDICAL CANNABIS CARD. THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT IS THIS BILL RIGHT SKINNER WANT THEM TO HAVE THE TAX EXEMPTION WANT TO HAVE TAX EXEMPTION OKAY SO IT IS A FEAR AMONG VETERANS. THAT IF THEY GET THE CARD FROM WHEN I STAND THAT COULD TRIGGER SOMETHING IS MORE THE FEAR THAT THIS COULD TRIGGER SOMETHING THAT WOULD. OKAY ONE LAST TIME KEEP GOING BACK TO IS YOU HAVEN'T PRESENTED. ANYTHING THAT MAKES ANY SENSE AT SAYS THE FEAR IS LOGICAL BECAUSE NOTHING HAS HAPPENED. NOBODY HAS LOST ANY BENEFITS NOTHING SO. BUT THAT'S ALSO BECAUSE LIKE GOOD SOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM BUT WHAT IT'S NOT THE BECAUSE WHEN WE TALK TO THE VETERANS BECAUSE OF THAT FEAR THEY'RE NOT ENTERING THE MARKET SO THEY'RE NOT LOSING THEIR BENEFITS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS. THEY'RE WORRIED IF THEY GO THROUGH THE PROCESS THEY WILL IN TURN LOSE THEIR BENEFITS ARE NOT ENTERING THE LEGAL MARKET SO WE DON'T HAVE NUMBERS SO WE'RE TRYING TO IN THIS BILL IS VERY NARROW. TO JUST SERVICE CONNECTED DISABILITY VETERANS SO THE OKAY SO ARE YOU ASKING THEM TO GET THE CAR I MEAN I'M TRYING TO GET. TWO OR IT CAN GET THE CARD. NOW I MEAN I YOU WANT THEM TO USE THEIR THEIR VETERAN HELP IDENTIFICATION CARD. IN ORDER TO GET THIS TAX EXEMPTION IS THAT JOIN US IN A CORRECTLY CORRECT YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO HAVE TO APPLY FOR THE STATE ISSUED CART. BECAUSE YOU'RE SAYING THEY'RE AFRAID THAT THAT'S GOING TO TRIGGER SOMETHING AND THEN THEY'LL LOSE THEIR VA BENEFITS SO. RIGHT CORRECT ME YOU'RE SAYING THAT THAT WILL AND YOU BELIEVE THAT THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN AT ALL. I'M ASKING YOU WHAT THE POINT IS OF YOUR BILL BECAUSE THEY CAN GET A STATE ISSUED ID CARD RIGHT NOW FOR MEDICAL CANNABIS THERE'S NO NEED. TO BECAUSE YOU REALIZE YOU'RE NOT EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE USING THAT VETERANS HEALTH IDENTIFICATION CARD FOR ANY PURPOSES OTHER THAN. OTHER THAN CHECKING IN AT A VA FACILITY. YOU KNOW THAT RIGHT [inaudible] YES. SO WE USE. THAT'S THAT'S THAT IS WHAT THE CARD IS SO I'M I'M CONFUSED BECAUSE YOU'RE. I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE TRYING. THIS PUTS THEM IN A WEIRD PREDICAMENT IF THEY ARE. THEY'RE USING FIRST OF ALL THAT THAT FEDERALLY ISSUE CARD THAT ISN'T SUPPOSED TO BE USED. FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN CHECKING INTO A BE A FACILITY IN GETTING BE A CARE. THAT'S A CONCERN BUT ASIDE FROM THAT I'M STILL TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. THAT THERE'S THIS FEAR THAT. SO RIGHT NOW FOR ME IS GOING TO HAVE THIS LIST AND THE FEDS ARE GOING TO COME IN AND CHECK THE LIST -- THAT COULD BE SO. BASED ON WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THEY CAN ONLY CHECK IN. TO BE A WITH THE VA CARD. TO GET VÃ¬ Ã£. IF YOU IN OUR IT'S WHICH IS MOST WHICH IS. PRESCRIBING OPIOIDS WE'RE TRYING. TO PROVIDE A NOTHER OPTION OTHER THAN OPIOID. RIGHT IN THE OPTION IS TO GET THE STATE ISSUED MEDICAL CANNABIS CARD RIGHT IS NOT ALREADY AN OPTION THAT IS AN OPTION BUT WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE NOT USING THE OPTION OR TRYING TO CREATE AND FACILITATE ANOTHER WAY TO GET THAT SAME EFFECT. AND I CAN DEFINITELY LOOK FOR SOME NUMBERS FOR YOU. OKAY. FIND THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BRO. THANK YOU THANKS FOR YOUR SERVICE SOME AN ARMY VETERAN MYSELF. I THINK WHAT THIS COMES DOWN TO IS. YOU'RE DEALING WITH FEDERAL VA BENEFITS IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STILL CONSIDERS MARIJUANA ILLEGAL SO NO V. A DOCTOR IS GOING TO TALK TO OF THAT ROUND ABOUT MARIJUANA. SO WE'RE KIND OF IN MIDDLE GROUND OF FEDERAL LAW A FEDERAL AGENCY YET. STATE A CALIFORNIA ALLOWS FOR MEDICINAL AND RECREATIONAL USE OF MARIJUANA. SO I THINK THAT'S THE FIRST ISSUE WHERE. I GET ALL THE GETTING PEOPLE OFF OPIOIDS AND IF SOMEBODY THINKS MARIJUANA HELPS THEM GREAT. BUT I DON'T THINK OUR BILL OR ANY STATE BILL. IS GOING TO CHANGE THE MIND OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND UNTIL THEY SAY MARIJUANA IS NOT A LEGAL THE THE FEDERAL VÃ¬ Ã£ IS NOT GONNA START LETTING -- YOU KNOW DOCTOR STALKER LET. PATIENTS. YEAH I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE ARE HONESTLY AND BUT I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN STARTING A CONVERSATION TO SEE [inaudible] OUR IS IT SOMETHING THAT THE VA SAYS IF SOMEONE USES MARIJUANA. DOES THAT SUBJECT THEM TO POTENTIAL PROBLEMS WITH THE WHOLE CONTINUUM OF CARE IN THE VA SYSTEM. I I I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT YET BUT DO YOU DO YOU NOW IF IF THAT'S THE CASE IF. IF THE VA'S MY PRIMARY HEALTHCARE PROVIDER TO YOU KNOW I'VE GOT A KNEE REPLACEMENT AND ON THIS AND I GET TREATED FOR THAT AND YOU USE MARIJUANA IN A STATE WHERE IT'S LEGAL DOES THAT JEOPARDIZE YOUR VETERAN BENEFITS. IT GETS A CAMPER TENSELY IF YOU I KNOW VETERANS THAT ARE IN PROGRAMS WITH THE VA WHERE THEY HAVE TO SHOW THEIR DOCTOR'S RECOMMENDATION. IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO RECEIVE THEIR BENEFITS BECAUSE OF URINALYSIS FOR BLOOD WORK TESTS THAT WOULD SHOW OF THE V. EIGHT TAKE A CALIFORNIA THE RECOMMENDATION FROM A CALIFORNIA. IF YOU HAVE TO BE IN A STATE THAT HAS A OF MEDICAL CARE PROGRAM AND THEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE A DOCTOR'S RECOMMENDATION TO BACK THAT UP A VALID. ONE SO THE THE OF A FEDERAL VA HOSPITAL OR CLINIC WILL TAKE. A MEDICAL MARIJUANA OR AYE MARIJUANA RECOMMENDATION. THEY'LL TAKE IT IN THE SENSE THAT YOU'RE FOLLOWING THE STATE MEDICAL PROGRAM. AND ARE USING IT FOR MEDICINAL PURPOSES AND THE FACT THAT YOU CAN'T -- THE DOCTORS CAN'T TELL YOU. IT'S IT'S LIKE DISCLOSING YOU KNOW YOU'RE MEETING WITH A DOCTOR YOU WANT TO DISCLOSE ALL YOUR MEDICATIONS WELL TO GET THE BEST ADVICE AND TREATMENT SO IN ORDER TO PROTECT YOURSELF AS A VETERAN. YOU NEED TO HAVE A DOCTOR'S RECOMMENDATION AND BE IN A STATE THAT HAS A MEDICAL MARIJUANA PROGRAM. SO YES THERE ARE THERE ARE VÃ¬ OUT THERE THAT -- AND THAT ARE NOT IN STATES THAT HAVE MEDICAL PROGRAMS AND THOSE THOSE VETERANS ARE AT HIGHER RISK OF LOSING ANY TYPE OF SERVICE OR PAIN MANAGEMENT -- YOU KNOW -- PROGRAMS. WHERE DO SO MY OWN RESEARCH I SERVED IN THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION TO FEE A FROM -- ISSUE BACK THEN OBVIOUSLY -- BUT I'M GONNA DO MY OWN RESEARCH AND SEE IF IT JEOPARDIZES VETERANS BENEFITS -- I MEAN I KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A SIX TAX. YOU KNOW EXEMPTION HERE BUT IT KIND OF OPENS UP A BROADER ISSUE -- MEAN YOU DON'T WANT TO GET REFERRED TO HEALTH COMMITTEE BUT IT IT IT DOES REACH A LOT OF THINGS HERE MEAN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT STATE FEDERAL. HEALTHCARE TAXATION SO -- I KNOW OUR TESTIMONY ONLY BUT I'M GONNA DO MY OWN RESEARCH BEFORE YOU BACK TO VOTE ONLY AND FIND OUT. RUNNING HIS ANSWER AND FOR IF YOU DON'T MIND. TO CHAIR OF I KNOW THIS IS A REAL CONCERN WITH THE VETERANS AND WHETHER IT'S A A PERCEIVED REALITY IT'S A REALITY TO THEM. AND OBVIOUSLY LOSING. YOUR MEDICAL BENEFITS AT THE VA -- COULD BE THE LIFE THREATENING AND SO IT WOULD BE REALLY GREAT NOT ONLY IF YOU CHECKED IN BECAUSE I'M NOT A VETERAN OF SEE. ASSEMBLY WILL MELENDEZ HAS A BETTER IN THIS GENTLEMAN'S A VETERAN -- AND I KNOW IF WE WANT TO DO IT. YEAH WE WE REALLY WANT TO FIND OUT THE STATE. BECAUSE IN THE ORIGINAL BILL WE DID HAVE THAT YOU HAVE A CARD IN THERE WE GOT PUSHED BACK FROM VETERANS THAT WERE. WERE VERY FEARFUL THAT THEY WOULD LOSE THEIR BENEFITS AND PART OF THE CHANGE IS MAKING SURE. THAT WE AND JEOPARDIZE THAT. AND I JUST OUT WANT TO ADD THAT WHEN WE WERE SPEAKING OF VETERANS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WE WERE VERY AWARE THAT WE DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE THIS VERY BROAD ALLOW MORE PEOPLE INTO THAT MARKET THEN WERE INTENDED. SO THAT'S WHY WE WENT WITH THE VETERANS THAT USE THE VA CARD THIS IS SERVICE CONNECTED DISABILITY ON THAT CARD BECAUSE THAT MEANS A V. A DOCTOR SAW THEM. SAW THAT THERE DISABILITIES WERE DIRECTLY LINKED TO THEIR SERVICE AND SO WE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE SOME SORT OF SEVERE DISABILITY WHERE THEY NEED SOME SORT OF MEDICATION. A LOT OF THEM WANT TO RELY ON MEDICAL MARIJUANA THEY'RE JUST NERVOUS TO AS WE JUST WANT HELP FACILITATE PEOPLE THAT THE MARKET WAS INTENDED TO HELP. ACTUALLY UTILIZING IN GETTING THE HELP THEY WANTED YEAH I GET THAT BUT WE ALSO WANT TO JEOPARDIZE RAIN THE OTHER HOLE RIGHT. TO NEW ASIAN FOR GETTING TO THE VA THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SEEN AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER DO YOU LIKE TO CLOSE A RICH BACK THROUGH S. WHEN I VOTE OKAY I DON'T GO TO THE BONE YARD BUT I GUESS I'M GOING TO BONIOR KEEPING. LIVING FILE ITEM FOR EIGHTY SEVEN NINETY ONE THIS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABER WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TODAY PERCENT EIGHTY SEVEN NINE ONE A BILL TO INCENTIVIZE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION AND PRESERVATION IN CALIFORNIA'S OPPORTUNITIES OWNS. WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE STAFF -- FOR YOUR HELPFUL FEEDBACK AND WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON DRAFTING AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THAT FEEDBACK. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHED OPPORTUNITIES OWNS TO INCENTIVIZE INVESTMENT IN DESIGNATED LOW INCOME CENSUS TRACKS. INDIVIDUALS TO MAKE INVESTMENTS THROUGH SPECIAL FUNDS IN THESE OWN TO BE ALLOWED TO DEFER OR ELIMINATE FEDERAL TAXES ON CAPITAL GAINS. CALIFORNIA'S EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE OPPORTUNITIES OWNS ARE APTLY NAMED THEY PRESENT AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEVERAGE PRIVATE INVESTMENT FOR THE BENEFIT OF ECONOMICALLY DISTRESSED COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER THE FEDERAL MEASURE LACKS GUIDELINES TO ENSURE THAT SUCH INVESTMENTS ACTUALLY BENEFIT LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AB SEVEN NINE ONE SIX TO GIVE CALIFORNIA VOICE IN THE PROCESS SO THAT WE CAN HELP TO DETERMINE THE TYPES OF INVESTMENTS THAT SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED IN OPPORTUNITIES OWNS. THE TAX CREDITS IN THIS BILL WILL INCENTIVIZE INVESTMENT IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING A PRESSING NEED IN OUR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. THERE'S ALREADY EVIDENCE OF REAL ESTATE SALES INCREASING PRICES IN OPPORTUNITIES OWNS STUDIES HAVE REPEATEDLY DEMONSTRATED THAT WHEN LAND AND RENTAL PRICES INCREASE AT THE FRONT OF DISPLACEMENT INCREASES FOR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE STATE NOT STAND BY WHILE FEDERAL OPPORTUNITIES OWNS GENERATE TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN NEW INVESTMENTS IN OUR LOWEST INCOME CENSUS TRACKS WITH NO REQUIRED PROTECTIONS OR PUBLIC BENEFITS. THIS BILL WOULD CREATE TWO CREDITS FIRST A TAX CREDIT FOR QUALIFIED DEVELOPERS TO ACQUIRE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROPERTY IN ORDER TO KEEP IT AT AFFORDABLE PRICES. THE SECOND CREDIT IS MODELED AFTER THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT A PROVEN AND BIPARTISAN TAX CREDIT. THAT WOULD SEEK TO INCENTIVIZE DEVELOPMENT OF LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES JONES IN ORDER TO SPUR THE DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING IN THE AREAS OF OUR STATE THAT NEED IT MOST. AB SEVEN NINE ONE WATCHING A MUCH NEEDED INVESTMENTS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRESERVATION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING ACROSS CALIFORNIA. IN A WAY THAT MAXIMIZES PUBLIC BENEFIT TO ADDRESS OUR STATE'S MOST PRESSING NEED AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR LOW AND MODERATE INCOMES. HOUSEHOLDS. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION ARM OUT SCHWARTZ PRESIDENT CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP. AND CYNTHIA PARKER PRESIDENT CEO OF BRIDGE HOUSING A LEADING NONPROFIT DEVELOPER AND MANAGER OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THANK YOU AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT MY BILL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR STAYING HERE THIS ITEM -- WHICH I FEEL IS REALLY IMPORTANT JUST ONE ADDS WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID WE HAVE HARD DATA NOW COMING IN. THAT THESE OPPORTUNITIES. DESIGNATIONS JUST BY THE FACT OF THEIR BEING DESIGNATED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ARE HAD CREATING -- HYPER SPECULATE IF -- FORCES IN SOME AS PUBLISHED BLOOM BURKE IN JANUARY. DOCUMENTED MORE THAN A 50% INCREASE IN INVESTMENT ACTIVITY IN OPPORTUNITIES ZONES. PRICE COMPARED TO NON OPPORTUNE SERVES ON AREAS BETWEEN THE TIME OF THE DESIGNATION. AND THE END OF THE YEAR. UC BERKELEY I STUDYING ARE THE GREATER BAY AREA PART OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. FOUNDEDOPPORTUNITIES ON INVESTMENTS ARE ALREADY CELEBRATING RENTS IN INCREASING GENTRIFICATION IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF OPPORTUNITIES OWNS. IN THE THIRTEEN COUNTIES INCLUDING THE NINE BAY AREA COUNTIES SACRAMENTO SAN JOAQUIN YOLO IN SANTA CRUZ. SO THE POINT IS THIS IS HAPPENING NOW. AND DOING NOTHING IS REALLY NOT A GREAT OPTION. CRITICALLY FOR LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. I WANT TO SPEAK JUST BRIEFLY TO THE FIRST OF THE TWO TAX CREDIT TOOLS IN THE SEVEN MEMBERS BILL. THIS IS A CAPITAL GAINS TAX CREDIT THAT WOULD ESSENTIALLY HELP. NONPROFIT CONTROLLED ENTITIES COMPETE TO BUY APARTMENT BUILDINGS IN THESE OPPORTUNITIES OWNS THAT ARE GETTING SNAPPED UP RIGHT NOW. AND WE'RE VALUES GOING THROUGH THE ROOF BECAUSE OF THIS SPECULATIVE ACTIVITY ONE EXAMPLE. IN OAKLAND EAST BAY ASIAN LOCAL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION RECENTLY PURCHASED A HUNDRED EIGHTY FOR AFFORDABLE HOMES IN FIVE PROPERTIES. AND I 95% OF THE EXISTING RESIDENTS. WERE LOW AND MODERATE INCOME WHO LIVING IN THOSE BUILDINGS ALREADY. HEADED OPPORTUNITIES ON FUND INVESTOR PURCHASED THOSE BUILDINGS INSTEAD OF THIS NONPROFIT. THEY REQUIRE A MINIMUM 16% INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN. JUST DOING BACK OF THE ENVELOPE MATH THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO INCREASE RENTS IN DOUBLE DIGITS IN MOST OF THE LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND MODERATE INCOME PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN AFFECTED. THE ONLY WAY THAT EACH PAGE LOCAL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION WAS ABLE TO BUY THOSE BUILDINGS. AND BE COMPETITIVE AND THEY'VE LOST MANY MORE THAN THEY'VE WON IS BECAUSE OAKLAND VOTERS HAVE PASSED THEIR OWN. BOND TO HELP THEM DO THIS STEP BOND IS NOW EXHAUSTED IN OTHER RESOURCE. SO THAT'S WHY THIS IS SUCH A CRITICAL UP PROGRAM AND I JUST WANT YOU KNOW I PARTICIPATE IN TWO NATIONAL FORUMS. AND EACH TIME I'VE MENTIONED THIS BILL TO THEM THERE IS RAMPANT INTEREST FROM OTHER STATES WE ARE HEAD AND THINKING ABOUT THIS BUT OTHER STATES ARE GONNA FOLLOW VERY QUICKLY. IF THE LEGISLATURE WILL APPROVE THIS [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M CYNTHIA PARKER AND I'M THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF BRIDGE HOUSING. BRIDGES A THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLD ORGANIZATION HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND WE ARE VERY ACTIVE AFFORDABLE DEVELOPER AND OWNER. I'M HERE TODAY TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE BILL OBVIOUSLY BUT ALSO BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR EVERYONE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE LOST A LOT OF TOOLS ALTHOUGH CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN VERY GENEROUS AND STEPPING UP AND PROVIDING OTHER SUBSIDY SOURCES -- JUST ONE EXAMPLE I MIGHT MENTION IS THAT WHEN THE THIS BILL THIS -- OPPORTUNITIES OWN LEGISLATION WAS INCLUDE INCORPORATED INTO THE TAX CODE IT ALSO THE TAX CODE ALSO PROVIDED -- CHANGES TO THE CORPORATE TAX RATE WHICH EFFECTIVELY LOWERED THE PRICE SCENE OF THE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT BY SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND BECAUSE WE'RE SO ACTIVELY TRY TO USE ALL THE TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN OUR TOOLBOX -- BRIDGE VERY QUICKLY STARTED LOOKING AT OZONE LEGISLATION AND ALSO WHAT IT MIGHT MEAN TO US AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT BY DOING THE KIND OF FINANCIAL MODELING THAT WE HAVE -- AROUND THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM WE THINK THAT IT MIGHT BE ABLE TO BRING THIS BACK UP TO EVEN -- WENT BEFORE THE CORPORATE TAX RATE STRUCTURE WAS WAS BROUGHT DOWN SO SO QUICKLY -- I ALSO THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT IS MATT IS MENTIONED IN A AND THE AUTHORS MENTIONED THAT -- THE GENTRIFICATION THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS AS A RESULT -- Z. A WILL HAPPEN REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THIS HAPPENED THIS OCCURS -- BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE TO INVESTORS TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND THEY COME IN AND TRY TO INVEST IN THESE NEIGHBORHOODS AND WANT TO KEEP AFFORDABILITY IN PLACE. BRIDGE HAS MADE A COMMITMENT WITHIN OUR OWN STRATEGIC PLAN THAT WE JUST PUBLISH. TO CREATE NINE THOUSAND NEW UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS IT'S A VERY AMBITIOUS GOAL THAT WE HAVE. A BETTER SO WE'RE VERY ACTIVE IN THE MARKET PLACE THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF MARKETING BROCHURES THAT ARE GOING ON I HAVE SEVERAL OF THEM -- AROUND -- Z. -- PARCELS FOR SALE AND AS MANNERS MENTIONED -- LANCE LANCE LANCE SALES IN THE SEE AREAS CALIFORNIA HAS EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE OC. A CENSUS AREAS -- HAVE SPIKE TREMENDOUSLY SINCE STATUS FOR STARTED -- HAPPENING. WE DON'T HAVE -- VERY HARD DATA ON HOW THIS IS INCREASED PRICING ONLY ANECDOTAL AT THE PRESENT TIME BUT I CAN TELL YOU FROM -- MY OWN -- BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT GUYS TO GO OUT AND LOOK FOR LAND OPPORTUNITIES -- FOR BRIDGE TO TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A LAST YEAR WE SAW -- AND PRICE ON A PROPERTY BEFORE -- Z. WENT INTO EFFECT AND IT WAS AROUND SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A DOOR FOR LAND -- THIS YEAR THE SAME MARKETING BROCHURE WAS LOOKING AT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. A DOOR FOR LAND CLASS SO SAME PROPERTY -- Z. NOT NO OC SO JUST TO GIVE YOU AN AND IDEA. I'M I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ALSO -- THAT WE HAVE -- SEEN OUR INVESTORS LOOK AT Z.. AND FOR A NON AFFORDABLE INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN THEY'RE LOOKING AT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND 18%. I ARE. FOR AFFORDABLE DEVELOPMENTS. YOU'RE LUCKY IF YOU HAD A 5% HIGHER ARE. SO INCENTIVES LIKE THIS WILL BE IMPORTANT TO BRING AND SOCIALLY MODIFIED MAJOR THEY DID INVESTORS OKAY THANK YOU ADDITIONAL ESSES IN SUPPORT -- PHILLY AS NAME INFLATION. TWENTY BE WITH THE A CALIFORNIA PROPOSITION US ASSOCIATION HERE TRANSPORT THANK YOU. WEARING A WHITE WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM IN SUPPORT THANK YOU WHEN IS IS IN OPPOSITION. SEEN ON COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE THAT QUIRK -- I THINK WHAT YOU'VE JUST SAID IS. AND READING ALSO THE COMMENTARY OF THE STAFF IS. OPPORTUNITY JONES ARE BAD FOR CALIFORNIA. I CAN'T THIS SEE IT ANY OTHER WAY -- WE DID HAVE THE EQUIVALENT IN THE STATE PROGRAM. WHICH ENDED UP TRANSFERRING HIGH PAID UNION JOBS. TO AREAS OF THAT IT MERELY NEEDED JOBS BUT THEN SENDING THEM TO MINIMUM WAGE -- THE OPPORTUNITIES JONES IN TERMS OF WHAT IT'S DOING TO THE COST OF HOUSING ALREADY. IS CRAZY -- I THINK WOULD BE BETTER OFF WITHOUT THE PROGRAM. MAYBE I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND IT BUT THERE ANYWAY WE CAN OPT OUT IF IT IS A STATE. SO AM I I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOU IF IT'S IT'S IT'S A IT'S AN ACTUAL QUESTION AND YOU'VE IDENTIFIED THAT THERE ARE CONCERNS AMONG A LOT OF FOLKS ABOUT OPPORTUNITY ZONES -- CONVERSELY THERE A LOT OF FOLKS THAT SEE THEM AS A AS A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY SO FOLKS WHO SEE A POTENTIAL CHALLENGE HERE AND ALSO. REAL OPPORTUNITIES TO BRING INVESTMENT PRIVATE INVESTMENT CAPITAL INTO CENSUS TRACKS UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY COULD NEED TO INVEST THE CAPITAL. THE BIGGER QUESTION FOR US IS SHOULD CALIFORNIA HAVE A VOICE IN DIRECTING HOW THAT CAPITAL WAS ALLOCATED AND WHAT THIS TAX CREDIT IS SAYING IS THAT YOU MAY LIKE OPPORTUNITY ZONES YOU MAY HATE THE IDEA. BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO EXPRESS SOME PRIORITIES WITH INVESTED. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAS SAID THAT A PART OF FINANCES SAID THAT YOU KNOW IN SEEKING TO DO TAX CONFORMITY AND THEY HAVEN'T RELEASED THE DETAILS. THEY BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD PRIOR TO PRIORITIZE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE CENSUS TRACKS SO I THINK THE QUESTION FOR THE COMMITTEE HERE TODAY IS YOU KNOW WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES OWNS THAT WAS A FACT THAT WAS A PIECE OF FEDERAL LEGISLATION. THAT IN FACT THE CENSUS TRACKS HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED ALL EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE OF ON THE QUESTION IS SHOULD CALIFORNIA HAVE A VOICE IN THE PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE SOME PUBLIC BENEFITS AND I THINK THE ANSWER TO THAT IS YES. WELL MY PROBLEM IS THAT IT SOUNDS IS HALF. JUST THE COST OF THE LAND IS ENOUGH TO NULLIFY. I MEAN IT IT'S BETTER OFF WITHOUT YEAR TAX CREDIT BUT THE COST OF THE LAND MAY BE IT MAY EVEN. NULLIFY THE IMPACT OF YOUR TAX CREDIT TO THE POINT WHERE IT BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT EVEN WITH YOUR TAX CREDIT TO BELT. I THINK WHAT I AND AND FEEL FREE TO DROP I THINK WHAT I HEARD IS THAT IS THAT THERE IS ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE THAT ARE REASONS TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES OWNS I DON'T KNOW THAT ANYONE HAS THE HARD DATA YET TO SAY. THAT THESE YOU KNOW ACROSS THE BOARD ARE GOING TO BE TERRIBLE AND LEAD -- TO YOU KNOW EXTREME RESULTS BUT I THINK GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW IN A TOTALLY. AND ALSO GIVEN WHAT WE UNDERSTAND ABOUT HOW THIS MARKET FUNCTIONS GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT OUR STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS. OUR BEST OPTION AT THIS POINT IS TO WEIGH IN AND TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO LEAD TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND ALSO PREVENT DISPLACEMENT IT JUST TO BE CLEAR. THERE ARE TWO PARTS OF THIS BILL RIGHT ONE OF THEM IS A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR CREDIT THAT'S FOCUSED ON PREVENTING DISPLACEMENT THE OTHER IS A TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR CREDIT THAT IS FOCUSED ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING. TO BRING A NEW UNITS ON MARKET WHAT THAT'S GONNA DO AS LEVERAGE WHAT WE EXPECTED TO BE A SIGNIFICANT. AND FUSION OF CAPITAL INTO THESE OPPORTUNITIES OWNS RATHER THAN TO BE A SHOPPING MALL OR A HIGH END RESTAURANT IT WILL FOCUS THOSE DOLLARS INTO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEN NO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YEAH I I I THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW WE AGAIN JUST TO SORT OF ECHO WHAT I SAID BEFORE -- YOU KNOW THE THE THE AND AND TO STEP BACK A MOMENT FROM SOME OF THE DISCUSSION HERE THE THE BIGGER QUESTION I THINK FOR THE COMMITTEE TO ANSWER TODAY AND I THINK THE GOVERNOR SOARED ANSWERED AS IT SHOULD CALIFORNIA HAVE A VOICE. IN DIRECTING THIS. SPENDING AROUND OPPORTUNITY SO IT'S SHOULD WE MAKE SURE THAT THIS INVESTMENT IS GOING TO HAVE A PUBLIC BENEFIT THAT IT'S GOING TO BENEFIT THESE COMMUNITIES AND I THINK THE ANSWER THAT IS ABSOLUTELY AND SO. YOU KNOW THERE ARE THERE ARE SOME WONDERFUL THINGS THAT WERE BROUGHT UP IN A COMMITTEE ANALYSIS CERTAINLY AS AN ATTORNEY I APPRECIATE QUESTIONS OF MAKING SURE THAT -- INTERPRETING THE BILL IS IT'S AN COULD INTERPRET CONSISTED WITH OUR TENT WERE VERY EAGER TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE BUT I THINK THIS IS A CONVERSATION THAT SHOULD CONTINUE. I BELIEVE THAT THAT'S THE THE GOVERNOR'S INDICATION AS WELL WE'VE HAD THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND WOULD JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU IT'S FOR TESTIMONY ONLY TODAY BUT WE WILL CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT I'M NEXT. OUR FINAL BILLS FILE ITEM TO BY THE CHAIR. AB TWENTY FOUR GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS TO AND MISTER CHAIR AB TWENTY FOUR SEEKS TO DISRUPT. THE CYCLE OF POVERTY BY PROVIDING A TARGETED CHILD TAX CREDIT. AB TWENTY FOUR REFLECTS A PRIORITY RECOMMENDATION OF THE LIFTING CHILDREN AND FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY TASK FORCE PRESENTATION PRESENTED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR IN NOVEMBER. THIS TAX CREDIT TARGETS DEEP POVERTY THOSE SURVIVING ON LESS THAN HALF OF THE CALIFORNIA POVERTY MEASURE A MEASURE THAT ACCOUNTS FOR COST OF LIVING DIFFERENCES IN EACH COUNTY. ENDING CHILDHOOD POVERTY HAS HAS LONG TERM STATEWIDE ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND THIS CREDIT HAS BEEN CAREFULLY DESIGNED. FIRST THIS CREDIT CONSIDERS A FAMILY'S TOTAL RESOURCE OF BOTH PUBLIC PUBLIC PROVIDED SUCH AS IN KIND BENEFITS AND PRIVATE SOURCES SUCH AS INCOME FROM MARK. AND AS NOTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES I WILL ADD CHILD CARE SUBSIDIES TO THIS LIST OF RESOURCES. SECOND BEFORE ACCESSING THIS CREDIT FAMILIES MUST HAVE APPLIED FOR ALL OVER OTHER AVAILABLE BENEFITS FINALLY THIS CREDIT IS BASED ON VERIFIABLE INFORMATION. WITH THE TARGETED CHILD TAX CREDIT WE TAKE AN IMPORTANT STEP AND FILLING THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO END CHILD POVERTY THE TASK FORCE HAS SO DILIGENTLY AND THOUGHTFULLY LAID OUT. I HAVE HERE WITH ME TODAY I CALMLY COLLINS CO CHAIR OF THE LIFTING CHILDREN AND FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY TASK FORCE HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS TO THIS ISSUE OF MADAM CHAIR AND TO THE TO THE MEMBERS -- THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE CHILD POVERTY TASK FORCE WILL COMPREHENSIVE IN ORDER TO BOTH. AND DEEP CHILD POVERTY AND REDUCE SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE OVERALL CHILD POVERTY IN THE STATE THAT IS ACTUALLY NEVER HAPPENED IN CALIFORNIA B. B.. IT BUT DESPITE THE EFFORTS WHICH HAVE BEEN MONUMENTAL. BY THE LEGISLATURE IN ADMINISTRATIONS -- TO MAINTAIN THE SAFETY NET IN CALIFORNIA. THERE'S BEEN A LACK OF A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO ACTUALLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA TWO MILLION AND SHALL IN CALIFORNIA. THE LARGEST NUMBER HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF CHILDREN 20% OF ANY STATE IN THE UNITED STATES. FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND OF THOSE CHILDREN. ARE IN DEEP POVERTY. AND IT'S THAT POPULATION THAT THIS TAX CRATERS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS. LET ME JUST BE CLEAR FOREIGN FIFTY THOUSAND CHILDREN IF IN ONE PLACE THAT WOULD BE LARGER MORE PEOPLE THAN FOR EXAMPLE THE CITY OF OAKLAND. SIXTY ONE THOUSAND OF THOSE CHILDREN. ARE IN THE DISTRICTS REPRESENTED BY MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE SIXTY ONE THOUSAND THE ONLY WAY TO ADDRESS THEM AND BEGIN TO MOVE THEM INTO A SITUATION WHERE THEY CAN BEGIN AND THEIR FAMILIES CAN BEGIN. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CAL WORKS OF THE I. T. C. OF THE WORK BASED BENEFITS. IS TO PROVIDE THIS A DIRECT BENEFIT. THIS ADDRESSES THE CHRONIC INSTABILITY OF THOSE IN DEEP POVERTY OBJECTIONS. IN AND OUT OF HOMELESSNESS -- CAR PROBLEMS THAT CAN'T BE FIXED. THEIR TELEPHONES -- SHUT OFF. IN IN SECURE -- CHILD CARE IN OTHER WORDS THIS PROVIDES THE BASIC INCOME NECESSARY SO THAT IT SIMPLY STABILIZE THEIR LIVES SUFFICIENTLY SO THEY CAN BEGIN TO MOVE OUT OF DEEP POVERTY AND TAKE ADVANTAGE. OF THE ONLY OF THE OTHER. UP PROGRAMS SO THIS IS NOT IN PLACE OF THE CAL WORKS ANY I. T. C. EXPANSIONS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS APPROVED IN THIS LEGISLATURE -- HAS SUPPORTED AND IS CONTINUING. TO THE THOSE ARE ALL UNNECESSARY AND WE'RE ALSO RECOMMENDATIONS FROM -- THE CHILD POVERTY TASK FORCE THESE THINGS HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER SO THIS IS NOT IN PLACE OF OF THOSE MEASURES NOR ARE THEY IN PLACE OF THIS. THIRTY THREE ONLY 333%. OF THOSE PEOPLE IN DEEP POVERTY IN THE STATE. ARE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE I. T. C. AND ONLY 20% OF THOSE IN THE POVERTY ARE ABLE TO TAKE EGGS TAKE ADVANTAGE. OF CAL WORKS. SO JUST PUT THIS IN CONTEXT THE AVERAGE -- MOUNT NECESSARY TO MOVE THE FAMILY AND IS IN DEEP POVERTY JUST IN THE POVERTY OUT OF DEEP POVERTY IS ABOUT FORTY EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. SO THE PROPOSALS THAT WOULD PROVIDE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR ARE REALLY IMPORTANT BUT THEY ARE -- FOCUSED ON SHALLOW POVERTY AND NEAR POVERTY NOT. NOT DEEP POVERTY [inaudible] SO. JUST TO PUT THIS IN A IN A CONTEXT -- BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A A A TENDENCY AND PROGRAMS LIKE THIS THAT ARE NEW PROPOSALS AND BY THE WAY THIS WAS DEVELOPED BY THE BY THE STANFORD UNIVERSITY. FOR BYE BYE CAL BY THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIAN BY THE BUDGET CENTER. AS THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY. OF ACTUALLY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN IN DEEP POVERTY IN THE STATE. AND THERE'S A TENDENCY WITH PROGRAMS TO SAY WILL YOU KNOW LET'S STUDY IT FURTHER. LET'S WAIT ANOTHER YEAR OR TWO LET'S LET'S -- FIGURE OUT IF THERE'S ANY POSSIBLE WAY TO DO IT TO LET LET'S FIGURE OUT ALL THE DETAILS ON THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS. IF THERE'S A BRIDGE FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S NOT EARTHQUAKE SAFE. WE FIX IT. AND IN OUR PERSONAL LIVES IF THERE'S A BIG HOLE IN THE ROOF OF OUR HOUSE. AND THE RAIN IS COMING IN AND WE CAN AFFORD TO FIX IT. IT'S A PRIORITY. WE FIX IT. AND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CHILDREN IN DEEP POVERTY IN AND OUT OF HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA SIXTY ONE THOUSAND OF THEM AND I CAN GIVE YOU THE NUMBERS FOR EACH OF THE DAY EACH OF YOUR DISTRICTS. SIXTY ONE THOUSAND OF THOSE CHILDREN. IN DISTRICTS THAT. THIS COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE REPRESENT. THOSE CHILDREN CAN'T WAIT ANOTHER YEAR. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY. AS A STATE TO ADDRESS AND LITERALLY IN DEEP POVERTY IN FOUR YEARS AND I THINK IF WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO IT. WE HAVE THE OBLIGATION TO DO IT -- SO I ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THIS MEASURE WHEN IT AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME FOR A VOTE -- JESSICA BARTOLO A FROM THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WAS THE CHAIR OF THE SAFETY NETS OF COULD SUBCOMMITTEE. OF THE CHILD POVERTY SUBCOMMITTEE AND IT WAS OUT OF THAT SUBCOMMITTEE THIS PROPOSAL WAS DEVELOPED [inaudible] THANK YOU. CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JUST GIVE OUR FLOW WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY -- I WANT TO JUST REMIND YOU WHY IT IS THAT -- WE FEEL IT IS URGENTLY -- THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO END CHILDHOOD POVERTY NOT JUST THOSE CHILDREN SIR BY THE COLORS PROGRAM BUT ALL CHILDREN. WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT CHILDREN WHO LIVE IN DEEP POVERTY AND DOOR LIFE LONG? CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR TIME IN DEEP POVERTY THE LONGER THEY STAY THERE. THE LONGER THE CONSEQUENCES THE DEEPER THE CONSEQUENCES. CHILDREN WHO LIVE IN DEEP POVERTY ARE MORE LIKELY TO GROW UP BEING POOR THEMSELVES AND RELYING ON PUBLIC BENEFIT PROGRAMS AS A RESULT OF THEIR STANDI POVERTY. THEY HAVE SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM EDUCATIONAL SUCCESS IMPACTS. AND THAT NOT ONLY -- IMPACTS THOSE CHILDREN BUT ALSO -- CHILDREN WHO ARE POOR BUT GO TO THE SAME SCHOOLS AS THEY DO -- BECAUSE THERE'S HIGHER NEEDS FOR THE THE CHILDREN LIVING IN THE PROPERTY OVER THE LONG TERM IT REDUCES THE STRENGTH IN THE CAPACITY OF THE FUTURE WORKFORCE. WHICH IS OF CONCERN IN CALIFORNIA. THE PARTY IS SO DANGEROUS TO CHILDREN BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEIR FAMILY IS INDEED POVERTY AS THEY GO WITHOUT THEIR BASIC NEEDS. THIS CREATES A LEVEL OF TOXIC STRESS THE CHANGES THE BRAIN CHEMISTRY IN THE CHILD'S BRAIN. AND IT REDUCES THEIR ABILITY FIRST AND FOREMOST TO COPE. THAT'S WHAT THE SCIENCE SAYS THAT IT TAKES AWAY OR MOVES THEIR CAPACITY AT TO COPE. THIS IS THE VERY SAME CAPACITY THEY WILL NEED NOT ONLY TO SURVIVE AND POVERTY BUT TO EXIT. A TO ME THAT'S THAT'S THE MOST COMPELLING REASON THAT WE ARE FILE ALLOWING CHILDREN TO RESIDE IN THE POVERTY WE ARE REMOVING FROM THEN THE VERY THING THEY WILL NEED. IN ORDER TO EXIT POVERTY AS YOUNG ADULTS. THERE'S ONE RESEARCH THAT SHOWS A GROWING UP ANTI POVERTY IS MORE TOXIC TO A CHILD THE NEO NATAL. EXPOSURE TO COCAINE. AND THINK ABOUT ALL THAT WE'VE DONE IN OUR IN OUR COUNTRY AND IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA TO ADDRESS -- ACCESS TO KNEEL EIGHT THE NEONATAL EXPOSURE TO COCAINE IF WE IF WE SIMPLY UNDERSTAND THE ITS WORST TO BE IN POVERTY. AND YOU KNOW HOW URGENT THE SAYS AND FINALLY GROWING UP IN POVERTY NOT ONLY IMPAIRS. THE BODIES AND THE AND REALLY THE SPIRITS OF THE SOULS OF CHILDREN EXPERIENCING THIS. AMEND THE FUTURE CAPACITY BUT ALSO THE MENTAL HEALTH AND THE MENTAL HEALTH OF THE PEOPLE IN THEIR FAMILY AND THIS IS BECAUSE OF BEING A PARENT AND HAVING A CHILD WHOSE BASIC NEEDS YOU'RE NOT ABLE. TO TO MEET -- INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF MATERNAL DEPRESSION OR PARENTAL DEPRESSION. AND THAT AS WE KNOW. PUTS DISTANCE BETWEEN A CHILD AND AND A CHECK AND AN INFANT AND AND THEIR PARENTS. AND WAYS THAT UNDERMINES EDUCATIONAL SUCCESS THE NUMBERS OF OF WORDS THAT THE CHILD -- KNOWS HOW MUCH HOW OFTEN THE CHILD THE SPOKEN. TO AT AT A LACK OF ACCESS TO BASIC NEEDS IS THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF MATERNAL DEPRESSION AS STUDIED AND RECENTLY REPORTED BY YALE -- RESEARCHERS ON THE TOPIC. FOR THESE REASONS AND BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST AND ONLY TIME THAT WE HAVE PROPOSED HOW DO AND CHILDHOOD THE POVERTY AMONG ALL CHILDREN ARE JUST CHILDREN SIR BY CAL WORKS -- WE ARE URGENTLY REQUESTING YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL. IF WE DON'T DO THIS WE WILL BE SAYING THAT IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY IN OUR GREAT STATE AND OUR GREAT ECONOMY THE FIFTH LARGEST IN THE WORLD IT'S OKAY. TO HAVE THIS HAPPEN TO CHILDREN. AND FOR THAT WE ARE JUST SUPPORT AS WE GO THROUGH THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU THANK YOU TO SHOW WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

OTHER MEMBERS RUSSIAN US QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SEEING NONE THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS -- YOU HAVE MY SUPPORT COME UP FOR A VOTE BUT WHICH I CLOSE -- YEAH I ACTUALLY NORMALLY I WOULD JUST REQUEST AN AYE VOTE -- ESPECIALLY DUE TO THE LATENESS OF THE HOUR BUT I DO HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY TODAY ON A WORKING ON WORKING ON GETTING THIS TASK FORCE AND THEN SPENDING THE TIME EACH MONTH AND WATCHING THIS TASK FORCE GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS TO REALLY UNDERSTAND. HOW WE CAN ELIMINATE DEEP TRIAL POVERTY AND CHILD POVERTY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS CHANGED ME? IT IS NOT JUST CHANGE THE WAY I LIVE OR THE WAY I LEGISLATOR THE WHERE IS MY DAUGHTER BUT IT'S CHANGED THE RULES THAT I CREATED FOR THIS COMMUTING. IT IS TO ME ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WE CAN DO. IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE QUALITY OF A CHILD'S LIFE IS IS EVERYTHING THAT WE WOULD EXPECT FROM THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. AND I TAKE THAT INCREDIBLY SERIOUSLY. AND THAT IS WHY THIS YEAR IN THIS COMMITTEE WE ARE LOOKING AT WHEN WE TAKE MONEY OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND IT MATTERS. AND WE ARE LOOKING AT WHAT IT REALLY WILL MOVE THE NEEDLE FOR CHILDREN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I KNOW THIS IS EXPENSIVE AND I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO COST A LOT OF MONEY. BUT THE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN IN THE TIME AND ENERGY THAT THIS COMMITTEE AND THIS TASK FORCE HAS PUT TOGETHER SHOWS THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST VITAL THINGS THAT WE CAN DO FOR THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR TESTIMONY ONLY BUT WILL BRING THAT UP AT A FUTURE COMMITTEE HERE [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] HER PARENTS [inaudible] WHERE TURNED?
