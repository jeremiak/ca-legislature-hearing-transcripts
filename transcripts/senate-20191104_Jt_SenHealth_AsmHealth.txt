HEALTH AND ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEES AND WHAT THANK EVERYONE FOR BEING HERE THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON MEDI CAL ACCESS TO CARE AND REGIONAL MODEL IN CHILDREN'S PREVENTIVE SERVICES. AND I APPRECIATE EVERYONE BEING HERE TODAY- THIS YEAR TO CALIFORNIA AUDITOR RELEASED TWO REPORTS THAT LOOKED AT THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES OVERSIGHT OF MEDI CAL AND THE DELIVERY SERVICES TO BENEFICIARIES. ONE REPORT CONCLUDED THAT MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES RESIDING IN RURAL COUNTIES UNDER TO REGIONAL MODEL DID NOT HAVE ADEQUATE ACCESS TO CARE. ANOTHER REPORT FOUND THAT MILLIONS OF CHILDREN MEDI CAL DID NOT RECEIVE PREVENTIVE SERVICE IS TO WHICH THERE WEREN'T ARE ENTITLED. TODAY'S INFORMATIONAL HEARING WILL REVIEW THE FINDINGS OF ITS TWO PARTS WE WERE ASKED TO THE PART OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND STAKEHOLDERS TO RESPOND TO THE FINDINGS. THIS DISCUSSION IS PARTICULARLY IN THIS DEPARTMENT CARE SERVICES ENTERS IN AND YOU SAID. OF STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS FOR THE NEXT MEDI CAL WAIVER. IT SEE IT ENTERS INTO AN RFP PROCESS FOR MANAGED CARE PLAN CONTRACTS. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STATE IS DOING EVERYTHING IT CAN TO ENSURE ALL MEDI CAL THE FISHERIES HAVE ACCESS AND RECEIVE- QUALITY HEALTHCARE I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT. ARE MEDI CAL PROGRAM WHICH IS A STATE. RUN IN FUNDED PROGRAM STATE AND FEDERALLY FUNDED PROGRAM. COVERS A THIRD OF ALL CALIFORNIANS AND IS A PEDIATRICIAN I'D BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T SAY HALF OF ALL CHILDREN. SO CERTAINLY- DEFICIENCIES AND PREVENTIVE CARE FOR CHILDREN AS WELL AS IN A RURAL COMMUNITIES IS PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT AND HAS A HUGE IMPACT ON. PEOPLE'S ACCESS TO CARE. SO BEFORE WE OUGHT TO BEGIN I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT CHAIR WOODS IS- ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE- WILL BE COMING IN A LITTLE LATER HE IS OF COURSE ENGAGE IN THIS DISTRICT WITH THE- CHALLENGES- WITH THE- WILD FIRES AND- BLACKOUTS AS WELL AND WE MAY EVEN TOUCH ON SOME OF THAT BECAUSE THAT CERTAINLY ALSO AFFECTS ACCESS AS WELL. SO WE WILL WELCOME HIM OUT BY HIM TO GIVE A REMARKS- HE ARRIVES. SO WITH THAT LIST AGAIN I WANNA. ASK THAT THE AUDITOR. PLEASE COME UP TO PRESENT THE FINDINGS OF THE FREEH REPORT. OF A HOT ON MEDI CAL REACHED THE MEDICAL REGIONAL MODEL AND I THINK- SOUTH THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE AND- ALSO I THINK- MISTER- MACABRE AS WELL. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BETTER MONITOR AND- LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR PRESENTATION OF- THE FIRST THE FIRST OF THE TWO REPORTS- MEDI CAL REGIONAL MODEL THANK YOU WELCOME. THERE OKAY OKAY OKAY TEST THERE WE GO AWRY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR THE RECORD MY NAME'S ELAINE HOWELL AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR WITH ME IS SHAUN MACABRE SEAN WAS THE SUPERVISOR ON THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT WORKING WITH THE TEAM. DOING THE ANALYSIS THAT THEY ARE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE ASKED US TO CONDUCT- WITH RESPECT TO THE REGIONAL MODEL. AND RURAL COUNTY SAID THE MEDICAID OR MEDICARE CALYX MANSION- INTO SOME OF THESE RURAL COUNTIES WE ISSUED THIS REPORT IN AUGUST OF TWENTY NINETEEN JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO- WHAT I WILL DO IS I'M GONNA GO VERY HIGH LEVEL OF. THE FINDINGS THAT WE IDENTIFIED IT REPORT AND THEN I'M GOING TO HAND IT OFF TO MISTER MACABRE AND HE WILL STEP THROUGH. WE HAVE A HAND OUT IT'S VERY DENSE TEXT WISE BUT HE'S GONNA STEP YOU THROUGH THE KEY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MADE AND WHAT THE CURRENT STATUS IS AS FAR AS THE SIXTY DAY RESPONSE THAT WE'VE RECEIVED FROM. PART IN HEALTH CARE SERVICES AS A YEAR WHERE DOCTOR PAN- AGENCIES WHEN WE CONDUCT AN AUDIT HAVE THE ABILITY TO RESPOND IMMEDIATELY ONCE WE'RE READY TO PUBLISH THE REPORT. AND THEN AT PRINT INTERVAL SIXTY DAY SIX MONTHS IN ONE YEAR SO FOR THIS AUDIT WE HAVE THE SIXTY DAY RESPONSE THE SUBSEQUENT AUDIT WILL TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT LATER. WE ACTUALLY HAVE A SIX MONTH RESPONSIBLE BY THE STATUS ON IT. I WILL. DOCTOR DOCTOR PAN IS RELATED YES- WE REALLY SAW SIGNIFICANT ISSUES WITH THE ABILITY OF BENEFICIARIES IN THESE RURAL COUNTIES TO GAIN ACCESS TO PROVIDERS WHAT WAS REFERRED TO AS ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARD SO THERE WERE STANDARDS ESTABLISHED MINIMUM STANDARDS AS FAR AS THE AMOUNT OF MILES OR THE AMOUNT OF TIME- THAT WOULD BE A STANDARD TIME FOR BENEFICIARIES BE ABLE TO ACCESS A PROVIDER BUT- AS THAT WAS BEING IMPLEMENTED. CARE SERVICES UP OUT SOME OF THESE. FUNDS TO SUGGEST ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARDS WHAT WE FOUND WHEN WE LOOKED AT THAT AND THIS IS CONSISTENT IN BOTH THOUGHT IT IS. THE NUMBER OF ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARDS THAT WERE ACTUALLY GRANTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES WAS SIGNIFICANT WE SCK UPWARDS OF TEN THOUSAND DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARDS.THAT WERE APPROVED BY THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES WITH RESPECT TO THE REGIONAL MODEL IN THESE RURAL COUNTIES IT WILL UPWARDS OF ABOUT A THOUSAND ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARDS. THE CONCERN WE HAD WAS MANY OF THESE ALTERNATE ACCESS STANDARDS WOULD REQUIRE A BENEFICIARY TO TRAVEL SOME CASES HUNDREDS OF MILES TO ACCESS A PROVIDER WITHIN A KILLER HEALTH PLAN. IN THE REGIONAL MODEL THERE TO HEALTH PLAN AND- AND HEALTH AND WELL- DEPENDING UPON WHICH PLAN. THE PROJECT BENEFICIARY PARTICIPATES IN THE PROVIDERS MAYBE TWO THREE HUNDRED MILES AWAY AND IN MANY CASES THESE LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DOUBLE EVEN A- MIDDLE INCOME INDIVIDUAL MAY NOT WANT TO TRAVEL THREE HUNDRED MILES- TO SEEK. A CALL CARE WE REALLY HAD CONCERNS ABOUT WHY THOSE ALTERNATIVE ACT STANDARDS WERE I DID- AND UP TO. LOOK AT PROP THAT HEALTH CARE SERVICES YOU USE I WE FELT THAT THERE WERE SOME FLAWS THEY AT THE PLAN REQUIRED. TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY'VE EXIST. ALL UP OPTION. ASIAN AS TO WHY AND IN MANY CASES WE SAW IT WAS BOILER PLATE FROM ONE ONE EXPLANATION TO THE NEXT DEPENDING UPON THE ALTAR OF ACCESS STANDARDS SO WE DIDN'T SEE HEALTHCARE SERVICES. REALLY EXPECTING THE PLANS TO PROVIDE WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION AS TO WHAT DUE DILIGENCE THAT THIS PLAN GO THROUGH TO TRY TO IDENTIFY PROVIDERS. AND THEN FINALLY- WITH RESPECT TO THE ACCESS TO CARE AND THESE ALTERNATE ACCESS STANDARDS- HEALTH CARE SERVICES COULD HAVE USED THEIR CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS- AND PUTTING SOME OF THESE THESE. PLANS ON THAT SO THAT THE BENEFICIARIES WOULD IT'LL TEMPORARILY BE ABLE TO USE OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDERS THAT PERHAPS WERE MUCH CLOSER TO HOME. THAN HAVING TO DROUGHT TO TRAVEL HUNDREDS OF MILES TO ACCESS CARE- SOME OF THE REASONS HEALTH CARE SERVICES I IDENTIFIED AS FAR AS WHY ARE THERE NOT ENOUGH PROVIDERS. YOU KNOW CERTAINLY FIRST RATE OUT ISSUE. THE OTHER ISSUE THAT WE IDENTIFIED HEALTH CARE SERVICES ALSO MENTIONED IS SINCE YOU HAVE TWO PLANS- SOME PROVIDERS MANY OF THE PROVIDERS ABOUT 70% WERE ONLY CONTRACTING WITH ONE PLAN THEY WEREN'T CONTRACTING WITH BOTH- SO THERE WERE SOME DIFFERENCES AS FAR AS IN ONE PLAN AND ACCESS TO PEDIATRICIAN MAY BE RELATIVELY CLOSE UNDER ANSEM BUT UNDER HEALTH AND WELLNESS THAT PERSON MAY HAVE TO TAKE THEIR CHILD HUNDRED FIFTY MILES. NOT SO THE ISSUE IS HAVING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN PLANS WERE REALLY HAVING TO MAKE ADDED AT A DECISION AS TO WHAT TYPE OF CARE DO I REALLY NEED AND WHICH PROVIDERS GONNA BE CLOSEST FOR ME BUT BUT IT WAS CERTAINLY A PROBLEM- WE DID SOME ANALYSIS USING MEDICAL BOARD DATA AND OSTEOPATHIC BOARD DATA TO DETECT ARE THERE ADDITIONAL PROVIDER IN THE ROOM. THAT PERHAPS CON THING WITH THE PLAN WE DID IDENTIFY ABOUT NINETEEN HUNDRED- PROVIDERS SO ONE OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS THAT MISTER WE'LL TALK ABOUT IS WHAT THANK HEALTH CARE SERVICES NEEDS TO DO MORE NOW THIS OF ALL THE IN THE CAPITAL WITH EXPECT THESE TURNED IT STANDARDS BUT HE- INTO THAT DO ADDITIONAL ALICE TO. PROVIDE IN THE REGION ARE RELATIVELY CLOSE TO THE BENEFICIARIES THERE ARE PROTESTS BEING IN THE POOL IN THE PLAN- ARE CONTRACTING WITH THE TWO PLANS. AND WHAT WE NEED. TO PROVIDE. SERVICES COULD TO RIP NOT. TO CARE FOR BENEFICIARIES SO THAT WAS THE FIRST ISSUE THAT WE IDENTIFIED. THE SECOND ISSUE IS WITH RESPECT TO COMMUNICATION WITH COUNTIES SO HEALTH CARE SERVICES AS I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE OF FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS REQUIRE HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO PROVIDE MONITORING- AND HEALTH CARE SERVICES DOES DO THAT THEY MONITOR THROUGH HE THIS- WHICH I'M SURE YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH AND THEY ALSO DO MEDICAL AUDIT REPORTS- WHICH LOOK AT UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT CASE MANAGEMENT. THE AVAILABILITY OF CARE ACCESS TO QUALITY OF MANAGEMENT THE ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY- THEY CONDUCT THESE AUDITS THEY ISSUE THESE AUDITS BUT THEY DON'T SHARE THE RESULTS WITH THE COUNTIES THEY BASICALLY POST POST THE INFORMATION HEALTHCARE SERVICES ON THE WEBSITE AND THEN IT'S UP TO THE COUNTY TO BE PROACTIVE AND BE LOOKING FOR- CALL REPORTS A LOT OF REPORTS THAT MAY BE PERTINENT TO THEIR PARTICULAR COUNTY. WE THANK HEALTH CARE SERVICES NEEDS TO BE A BETTER JOB OF COMMUNICATING THAT INFORMATION TO THE COUNTIES PRO ACTIVELY- AND MORE TOPICALLY WHAT THEIR DEPARTMENT- WAS DOING. IS WHEN THEY WOULD COMPLETE MEDICAL AUDIT REPORT THEN THAT PLAN WOULD HAVE TO PUT TOGETHER CRAP CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN WITH RESPECT ANY CHOOSE OUR FINDINGS THEY WOULD WAIT UNTIL THAT CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN WAS COMPLETED BEFORE THE POST THE MEDICAL OUR REPORT ON THE WEBSITE WE SHOULD GET THE MEDICAL OUT REPORT UP THERE AND THEN WHEN THE CORRECTIVE AT THE PLANT. THEN YOU CAN ALSO POST THAT GET THAT INFORMATION OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE ON YOUR WEBSITE. BUT ALSO BE MORE PROACTIVE IN COMMUNICATING WITH THE COUNTIES. WHEN WE TALK TO SOME OF THE COUNTIES SOME WEREN'T FULLY AWARE OF ALL THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MONITORING THAT HEALTH CARE SERVICES DOES- AND CERTAINLY DIDN'T KNOW THAT. HEALTH CARE SERVICES WAS CONDUCTING THESE MEDICAL AUDITS AND THOSE COUNTIES FELT THAT THAT INFORMATION WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO THEM AS THEY TRY TO ASSIST BENEFICIARIES. WITH RESPECT TO THEIR RIGHTS ETCETERA ACCESS TO CARE QUALITY OF CARE THOSE SORTS OF THINGS. SO THAT'S THE SECOND ISSUE REALLY NEED TO STRENGTHEN THEIR COMMUNICATION WITH THE COUNTIES WITH RESPECT TO QUALITY OF CARE AND DEFICIENCIES. THAT THEY ARE IDENTIFYING WHEN THEY CONDUCT THESE AUDITS AND CERTAINLY. THE HE IS RESULTS THOSE. EFFECTIVENESS RESULTS. THE LAST ISSUE WAS REAP WITH RESPECT TO. ASSISTING IN EDUCATING COUNTIES WHEN THE TRANSITION WAS HAPPENING SO THIS WAS BACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN- WE FELT THAT THE EVIDENCE DEMONSTRATED THAT HEALTH CARE SERVICES DIDN'T REALLY ACTIVELY ENGAGE WITH THE COUNTIES. NOW THEY DID HAVE SOME OPEN MEETINGS THEY HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS WITH THE COUNTIES. BUT THEY DIDN'T DO WHAT WE FELT WOULD BE DEMONSTRATING LEADERSHIP AND REALLY EDUCATING THE COUNTIES ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A COUNTY COAST PLAN OR WHAT WOULD THE STEPS BE REQUIRED TO DO THAT WATER ALL YOUR OPTIONS AS A COUNTY. SOME OF THESE COUNTIES DIDN'T HAVE. ESSENTIALLY THE EXPERTISE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS THE BEST DECISION FOR THE BENEFICIARIES IN OUR REGION SO WE REALLY FELT HEALTHCARE SERVICES COULD HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB SHOULD HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB. IN COMMUNICATING WITH THE COUNTIES EARLY ON SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT A MULTI COUNTY CODES MADE SENSE- SOME OF THE- SKEWS ME SOME OF THE COUNTIES WERE ABLE TO. JOIN PARTNERSHIP HEALTH WHICH IS. A CODE. THERE WERE A HANDFUL OF THOSE THOSE COUNTY ACTUALLY TV DISTANCE NONPROFIT AND HELPING THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY NEEDED TO DO TO APPROACH PARTNERSHIP HEALTH. AND TO BE ABLE TO BECOME PART OF THAT CODES BUT NOT ALL OF THE COUNTIES HAD THAT KIND OF ASSISTANCE SO WE FELT THAT HEALTH CARE SERVICES NEEDED TO BE. DEMONSTRATE MORE OF A LEADERSHIP ROLE WITH RESPECT TO THE TRANSITION. AND THE REASON WE REALLY WANTED TO EMPHASIZE THIS IS SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU SAID DR PAN. THERE THE TWO HEALTH PLANS IN THE REGIONAL MODEL RIGHT NOW HEALTH AND WELLNESS IT EXPIRES AND TWENTY TWENTY SO I KNOW. HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS AN R. F. P. IN GOING THROUGH THAT PROCESS- ANTHEM HEALTH THAT EXPIRES IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE WHICH A LITTLE FURTHER OUT. BUT STILL- IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCAE SERVICES STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO REALLY WORK WITH. THESE COUNTIES BECAUSE SOME OF THESE CAMPS HAVE REALLY EXPRESSED INTEREST IN EITHER DEVELOPING A MULTI COUNTY. WAS. UP WITH. OUR TYPE MODEL- BECAUSE WHAT THEY CURRENTLY HAVE IS JUST NOT WORKING WITH RESPECT TO ACCESS TO CARE. AND CERTAINLY NOT QUALITY OF CARE WHEN WE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE HEAT IS OUR RESULTS. SO WE MADE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES THAT THEY- THIS TIME AROUND THEY NEED TO BE MORE PROACTIVE WORKING WITH. THE COUNTIES IF THERE'S A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO. HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE BUT REALLY STARTING NOW. REALLY SINCE ONE OF THE PLANS EXPIRES ON THE CONTRACT EXPIRES NEXT YEAR SO I REALLY STEPPING IT UP AS FAR AS THE ASSISTANCE TO THOSE THOSE RURAL COUNTIES- SO THOSE WERE THE THREE HIGH LEVEL KEY ISSUES- SUMMER COBBS GONNA STEP YOU THROUGH. THE MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS WE HAD SOME RECOMMENDATIONS OBVIOUSLY RELATED TO ACCESS TO CARE THOSE ALTERNATIVE STANDARDS BUT ALSO SOME OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS WITH RESPECT TO COMMUNICATION COORDINATION- ETCETERA SALTER OVER MISTER COBB. THANK YOU MICHELLE A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MY NAME IS SEAN MACABRE ON THE SENIOR AUDITOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE- WE HAD FIFTEEN RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MADE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES REGARDING THE THREE ISSUES THAT THE STATE AUDITOR JUST DISCUSSED. THE DEPARTMENT HAS FULLY IMPLEMENTED FOR OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AGREED TO IMPLEMENT ANOTHER SIX BUT IT'S STILL IN PROGRESS. AND HAS RESPONDED THAT IT WILL NOT AND IMPLEMENT FIVE OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. I'M GONNA DISCUSS THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE SAME ISSUE GROUPINGS THAT THE STATE AUDITOR JUST DISCUSSED- REGARDING ACCESS TO CARE. THE DEPARTMENT HAS- MADE PROGRESS IMPLEMENTING OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO VALIDATE HEALTH PLANS NARRATIVES REGARDING AND ABILITIES TO MEET STATE ACCESS STANDARDS- AND RESPONDED. HOWEVER IT HAS RESPONDED THAT IT WILL NOT IMPLEMENT OUR RECOMMENDATION TO DETERMINE THE AREAS OF THE REGIONAL MODEL THAT ARE LACKING SPECIFIC PROVIDERS AND DEVELOP STRATEGIES TO RETREAT TO PROVIDE. GHS DESCRIBE THAT DOES NOT ITS PREVIEW HOWEVER WE FEEL GIVE. ONE OVERSEEING THE STATE'S PROVISION OF MEDICAL SERVICES IT IS WITHIN ITS PEER REVIEW. ADDITIONALLY THE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED THAT IT WILL NOT IMPLEMENT OUR RECOMMENDATION TO REQUIRE HEALTH PLANS TO AUTHORIZE OUT OF NETWORK SERVICE IF THEY CANNOT DEMONSTRATE THEY HAVE EXHAUSTED ALL OF THEIR REASONABLE OPTIONS. TO OBTAIN PROVIDERS. DHS RESPONDED THAT IMPROVING ITS ALTERNATE ACCESS STANDARD REQUEST VALIDATION PROCESS. HOWEVER THAT RESPONSE IS NOT ADDRESS HOW IT WILL HANDLE SITUATIONS IN WHICH HEALTH PLANS ARE NOT ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY HAVE EXHAUSTED ALL OF THE REASONABLE OPTIONS. TO OBTAIN PROVIDERS. OUR RECOMMENDATION SPECIFIES THAT DH CS SHOULD REQUIRE THOSE PLANS TO AUTHORIZE OUT OF NETWORK CARE. REGARDING OUR RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE ISSUE TO IMPROVE COMMUNICATIONS WITH COUNTIES- THE DEPARTMENT HAS FULLY IMPLEMENTED THREE OF OUR FOUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND HAS AGREED TO REQUEST FEEDBACK FROM COUNTIES REGARDING THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH HEALTH PLANS. FINALLY THE THIRD ISSUE ASSISTING COUNTIES THAT DESIRE TO CREATE OR JOIN OPPOSE. THE DEPARTMENT HAS MADE PROGRESS IN PROVIDING BETTER INFORMATION REGARDING MANAGED CARE BROADLY AND AGREED TO DEVELOP INFORMATION THAT WOULD INFORM COUNTIES OF THE STEPS AND REQUIREMENTS OF JOINING OR CREATING ECHOES. ADDITIONALLY THE DEPARTMENT HAS AGREED TO DETERMINE THE CAUSES OF THE REGIONAL MODEL HEALTH PLANS AND ABILITIES TO MEET THE STATE ACCESS STANDARDS. THE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED THAT IT WILL NOT IMPLEMENT A RECOMMENDATION TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE STRUCTURE OF A CLOSE WOULD IMPROVE THE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND THE REASON MODEL COUNTIES. AND TO ASSIST TOWNIES AND CREATING A BECAUSE OF THE DESIRE TO DO SO MEANT. INDICATED THAT IT WOULD DETERMINE ITS NEXT STEPS REGARDING. THIS RECOMMENDATION AFTER DETERMINES THE CAUSES OF THE REGIONAL MODEL HEALTH PLANS AND ABILITIES TO PROVIDE CARE THAT MEETS THE STATE STANDARDS. HOWEVER AT DHS WOULD BE BETTER INFORMED HAVING EVALUATED WHETHER THE CAUSE WOULD IMPROVE ACCESS TO CARE AND THE REGIONAL MODEL. AND COUNTIES MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CREATE A BECAUSE WITHOUT DHS IS ASSISTANCE. ADDITIONALLY THE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED THAT IT WILL NOT IMPLEMENT OUR RECOMMENDATIONS DETERMINE WHETHER IT HAS THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO ASSIST COUNTIES IN CREATING THE CAUSE OF THE DESIRE TO DO SO. MEN RESPONDED THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE THE FINANCIAL REESE'S RESOURCES TO DO SO. AND THAT COUNTIES- SHOULD REQUEST THE- FUNDING ON THEIR OWN IF THEY DESIRE TO GO HOWEVER BECAUSE THE REGIONAL MODEL COUNTY- THE REGIONAL MODEL INCLUDES MANY COUNTIES THAT MAY DESIRE TO TRANSITION INTO A SINGLE MULTI COUNTY BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE FOR DHS TO SUBMIT A CONSOLIDATED FUNDING REQUEST. TO THE LEGISLATURE AND PLAY A LEADING ROLE IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THAT PLAN RATHER THAN FOR THE COUNTIES TO EACH SUBMIT INDIVIDUAL REQUESTS ON OUR OWN. FINALLY THE RESPONDED THAT IT WILL NOT IMPLEMENT A RECOMMENDATION TO PROVIDE COUNTIES WITH REASONABLE TIME TO DECIDE WHETHER. WHETHER TO CHANGE THEIR MANAGED CARE MODELS AND ESTABLISH NEW ONES AND TO ALSO INCLUDE LANGUAGE AND IT'S TWENTY TWENTY REQUEST FOR. PROPOSALS TO ALLOW COUNTIES THAT CAN DEMONSTRATE THEIR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT ECHOES TO OPT OUT OF THE ARE IFFY. REASONING THAT THE DEPARTMENT PROVIDE WAS THAT IT WILL NOT IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATION BECAUSE THE R. F. P. IS SPECIFIC TO THE MODEL TYPE. AND IT WOULD BE WILLING TO WORK WITH COUNTIES IF THEY DESIRE TO SWITCH MODEL TYPES HOWEVER BY IMPLEMENTING A RECOMMENDATION THE DEPARTMENT WOULD DEMONSTRATE ITS COMMITMENT TO HELPING SMALL ORAL COUNTIES. IMPROVE THE ACCESS TO CARE FOR THEIR BENEFICIARIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS. SO FIRST I JUST WANT TO SEE- FOR THE RECORDS SO IN TERMS OF THE WORK THAT YOU DID FOR THIS PARTICULAR REPORT- DID YOU PRIMARILY LOOK AT JUST THE MEDICAL SIDE OF THINGS- DID NEEDED TO YOU KNOW LOOK AT THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- MENTAL HEALTH CA RALPH WHICH IS USUALLY. ORGANIZED IN A DIFFERENT WAY WITH- OF WITH COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS THIS IS THIS IS PRIMARILY ON THE% PHYSICAL HEALTH SIDE OF HE MEDICARE PROGRAM GRANT THAT'S CORRECT DOCTOR PAN THE SPECIFIC REQUESTS FROM THE MEMBERS WAS TO LOOK AT PRIMARILY ACCESS TO CARE AND THEN THIS TRANSITION THAT OCCURRED TO MANAGE CARE BACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN. AND THE VARIOUS DIFFUSER TWENTY EIGHT RURAL COUNTIES EIGHTEEN ENDED UP IN THIS REGIONAL MODEL BUT IT WAS REALLY LOOKING AT STRUCTURE ACCESS TO CARE QUALITY OF CARE WE DID NOT LOOK AT BEHAVIORAL. HEALTH CARE ALL RIGHT AND- I REALIZE IS A LITTLE BIT HISTORICAL AND I COULD PERHAPS ALSO SPEAKS YES BUT YOU WERE DOING THIS AUDIT- THE CHEVY STATION THIS TO WHY WE- CHOSE I WAS IN THE LEGISLATURE TO TAX HAVE SOME IDEAS BUT- WHY. IT WAS DECIDED TO PURSUE THAT PARTICULAR REACH. WAS THAT PART OF I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT YOU'RE THAT. WAS PART OF THE DISCUSSION AS YOU'RE DOING THE AUDIT OR NOT. THERE THERE'S AN ONGOING EFFORT IN THE STATE TO BRING MANAGED CARE INTO THE MEDICAL PROGRAM BECAUSE THE STATE'S USE THAT SEES IT THERE'S A BENEFIT TO IT OVER THE FEE FOR SERVICE PROGRAM. OKAY ALL RIGHT IN THE LAB RATE ANYMORE THAN THAT IS TO THE REGIONAL BUYER. THIS WILL CAUSE IS ALSO A MANAGED CARE MODEL SO I MEAN THERE'S MULTIPLE MANAGED CARE MODELS. THAT'S CORRECT AND DOCTOR PAN AS AS A MISTER MACABRE INDICATED WE WHEN WE LOOKED AS I SAID THERE WERE TWENTY EIGHT- COUNTIES THAT WERE TRANSITIONING IT WAS PART OF THE EFFORT TO TRANSITION MORE AND MORE COUNTIES TO MANAGE CARE BECAUSE OF THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF MANAGED CARE. AND THEN WHEN WE DO DISCUSS IN THE REPORT THERE WERE SOME COUNTIES THAT WERE ABLE TO- JOINT PARTNERSHIP THERE WERE TWO COUNTIES THAT IS STEPS THEIR OWN. CODES BUT THEN THERE WERE THESE OTHER EIGHTEEN COUNTIES THAT DIDN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT SOME OF THEM TRIED TO JOIN PARTNERSHIP. PARTNERSHIP REJECTED IT BECAUSE- IT HAD REACHED CAPACITY- SO WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT OKAY WHY DID THESE EIGHTEEN AND UP IN THIS REGIONAL MODEL IT WAS KIND OF LIKE A LAST. ACT CHOICE OF LAST RESORT AND THAT BY WE HAVE CONCERNS. IN THE REPORT ABOUT. IS PROVIDING THAT YOUR SHIP WE THINK SHOULD HAVE PROVIDED IN THE PAST. AND THAT WE THEY SHOULD PROVIDE NOW AND GIVE THESE COUNTIES ADDITIONAL OPTIONS. WITH RESPECT TO PERHAPS A MULTI COUNTY KOS MODEL THAT MAY BE BETTER FOR THE STATE. AND CERTAINLY BETTER FOR BENEFICIARIES WITH RESPECT TO ACCESS THE CARE AND QUALITY OF CARE. SO ONE COULD ARGUE THAT- AM NINE REPRESENTS A COUNTY THAT HAS GEOGRAPHIC MATCH CARE WE HAVE FIVE PLANS. SACRAMENTO COUNTY. WE CAN WE WON'T GET INTO THE ISSUES THERE- BUT. YES ONE QUESTION IS THAT IT'S- NOT NECESSARILY INHERENT TO OTHER ECHOES ARE MULTI PLAN MODEL THAT YOU NECESSARILY HAVE TO HAVE ACCESS ISSUES SO I'M PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN. THE RECOMMENDATIONS YOU HAD THAT DH CS SAID THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO PURSUE REGARDING THE ACCESS SO I REALIZE THERE'S THE MODEL PART THAT'S THEIR DIFFERENT DYNAMICS THERE BUT- IT'S FOR EXAMPLE ENSURING THAT- PATIENTS WHO NEEDED. US USUALLY PROBABLY SPECIALTY CARES MORE LIKELY- THAT- IF THEY NEED TO GO OUT OF NETWORK THAT- IF THERE WAS AN INADEQUATE NETWORK BY THE PLAN. THAT THE DEPARTMENT WOULD. HELP FACILITATE THAT- SO CAN CAN USE CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE- NETWORK ISSUE SAID YOU SAID YOU LOOKED INTO FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE MANY- PHYSICIANS AND OTHER PROVIDERS TO DID NOT- WHO ARE AVAILABLE BUT YET- DID NOT CONTRACT OR ONLY CONTRACTED WITH ONE PLAN. AND CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE LEVEL EFFORT THAT THE- AGENCY MADE TO TRY TO BE SURE PEOPLE COULD GET REASONABLE ACCESS AND TIMELY ACCESS. AND PERHAPS ALSO TOUCH ON YOU MENTIONED A NUMBER OF TIMES THAT THE SORT OF GAVE ALTERNATE STANDARDS BUT WHAT PERCENTAGE AND IF THERE'S A SENSE OF PERCENTAGES LIKE THIS HOW FREQUENTLY THIS HAPPENED BEYOND JUST. AS IT IS- IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER FOR ALL THAT CENTER. WELL WITH RESPECT TO THE ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARDS THAT THE DEPARTMENT GRANTED AS WE DISCUSS AND IN THE PREVIOUS AUDIT REPORT- THEY BASICALLY APPROVED EVERY ALTERNATE ACCESS STANDARD REQUEST THAT THEY GOT UNLESS THE REQUEST WAS INCOMPLETE WHERE THERE WASN'T SUFFICIENT DOCUMENTATION OR THEIR IT WHAT THE APPLICATION WASN'T COMPLETE. BUT IF THEY RECEIVE A COMPLETED APPLICATION IT WAS PRETTY MUCH A THREE HUNDRED AND RUBBER STAMP OKAY I DON'T SAY THAT THE REPORT BUT WE SAY THAT THEY APPROVED ALL OF THE ALTERNATE ACCESS STANDARDS- THAT WERE SUBMITTED THAT WERE DEEMED COMPLETE. AND WE HAD CONCERNS WITH THAT BECAUSE- THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY HOLDING THOSE PLANS ACCOUNTABLE TO SAY WHAT DID YOU DO TO EXHAUST ALL OPTIONS AND AN OPTION IS TO TEMPORARILY PROVIDE OUT OF. OUT OF NETWORK. FIGHTERS ACCESS- SO WE THINK THAT SOMETHING THEY SHOULD DO AND WITH RESPECT TO THE ANALYSIS I MENTION THE NINETEEN HUNDRED PROVIDERS. WHAT WE DID AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE SHARE IT WITH YOU WHEN WE TALK WITH YOU IN THE PAST BUT- WE ACTUALLY HAVE AN- I. T. SUPPORT GROUP AND OUR OFFICE THAT DOES ANALYTICS. SO WHAT THEY WERE ABLE TO DO- USING MEDICAL BOARD DATA AS I INDICATED AN OSTEOPATHIC BOARD DATA. IDENTIFY PROVIDERS IN THE RURAL COUNTIES THAT HAD NOT CONTRACTED WITH EITHER PLANS- BUT WE ALSO WERE ABLE TO CREATE- AN INTERACTIVE MAP AS FAR AS DATA ANALYSIS SO THAT. IT WOULD BE RELATIVELY EASY FOR HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO IDENTIFY WHICH COUNTIES. ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE SOME PROVIDERS THAT ARE CONTRACTING WITH WITH EITHER PLAN REACH OUT TO THOSE PROVIDERS AND SAY WHAT IS IT GOING TO TAKE ARE THERE INCENTIVES. THAT WE CAN PROVIDE. SIX TO PROVIDE PROVIDERS MORE WHAT. WE JUST THINK THAT DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES COULD BE DOING MUCH MORE ANALYSIS WE DID IT DURING THE COURSE OF THE AUDIT SO I THINK THAT AS AN AGENCY THEY WOULDBE ABLE TO DO THAT. AS A STANDARD COURSE OF PRACTICE. AND DID YOU IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THE AUDIT. SO THERE'S THE NOW WE HAVE THE NETWORKS HAVE TWO PLANS THEY HAVE THEIR EXISTING NETWORKS- WERE YOU ABLE TO EXPLORE ARE ENGAGED IN THE AUDIT. LOOKING AT WHAT- HOW MUCH EFFORT THE DEPARTMENT ENGAGED IN AND BE SURE THAT THE PLANS THEMSELVES ACTUALLY HAD ADEQUATE NETWORK START WITH SO. IN THIS YEAH WE TALKED ABOUT WELL GEE THEY DON'T HAVE ONE TO GIVE THEM A WAY AROUND. BUT IS THAT THAT. HOW MUCH DID THE OVERSIGHT TO THE DEPARTMENT PUT INTO BEING SURE THAT THE NETWORK TO START WITH. ACTUALLY HAD SUFFICIENT. PEOPLE WHO WERE IN. THE AND IT'S TO BASICALLY PROVIDE TIMELY ACCESS NOT JUST SOMEONE WHO IS HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY. THE STATE STANDARDS THAT WE ADDRESS IN THE REPORT ARE- FAIRLY RECENT STANDARDS I BELIEVE THEY THEY WERE APPROVED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND BECAME ACTIVE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. WHICH WAS AFTER THE STATE- CONTRACTED WITH THE HEALTH PLANS TO PROVIDE SERVICE IN THAT REGION. SO THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEFORE HAND BECAUSE THE STANDARDS WERE TO APPLICABLE THEN OKAY AND HOW ACCURATE WERE TO PROVIDE A LIST FROM THE PLANS WHEN YOU WERE DOING THE AUDIT IS THAT IT TO ANY ISSUES IN TERMS OF ACCURACY OF THE PROVIDER. LIST NETWORK TERMS OF ACTORS THE- DURING THE COURSE OF THIS AUDIT WE DID NOT DO THAT TYPE OF ANALYSIS DR PAM BUT THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED IN PREVIOUS AUDITS AND THE MOST RECENT AUDIT. THE AUDIT WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT LATER WE IDENTIFIED THAT AGAIN AS AN ISSUE SOME OF THOSE PROVIDER DIRECTORIES. WERE NOT ACCURATE BUT A PROVIDER MAY HAVE BEEN LISTED IN THE DIRECTORY BUT IS NOT TAKING MEDI CAL PATIENTS. OR IS NO LONGER PRACTICING SO- WE DID. THEY'RE DOING A BETTER JOB OF CLEANING UP THOSE DIRECTORIES- COMPARED TO AN AUDIT WE DID A YEAR OR TWO AGO. BUT THAT STILL CONTINUES TO BE AN ISSUE FOR BENEFICIARIES. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU- I ACTUALLY. WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT THANK YOU CENTER RUBIO FOR JOINING US AND- AND OF. AS A WEEK WE'RE AT THE- AUDITOR'S PRESENTATIONS I KNOW HE HAD SOME REMARKS ARE USED TO ASK QUESTIONS OF THE IDEA WELL I DON'T WANT TO BE BY YOURSELF I DECIDED TO JOIN YOU. KEEPING EVERYONE THANK YOU ON. BEING HERE. THE QUESTION I'M SORRY I WALKED IN AND YOU WERE SAYING THAT SOME FORGET ME PHONE. YOU ALREADY STATED. YOU HAVE. STAFF THAT DOT THE SPIDER SHOULD BE THANK. DON'T. OFFER ACCESS SHOULD BE AT LEAST CONTRACTING WITH. PROVIDE TEMPORARY. LEAST IDENTIFYING SOME OF THE ONES THAT ARE NOT PART OF THE TWO MAJOR ONES. I IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU SUGGESTED THAT YOU QUESTION I JUST WANT TO KNOW LIKE ARE THEY AWARE IS IT SOMETHING THAT. THEY WERE OPEN TO WIN WILL GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT OF THE BACKGROUND. SO HOT THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES HAS THE ABILITY TO. REQUIRE HEALTH PLANS TO PROVIDE TEMPORARY OUT OF NETWORK AS PART OF A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN SO. IF ALL APPROACH A HEALTH PLAN IS SUGGESTING WE NEED AN ALTERNATE ACCESS STANDARD- AND THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE A BENEFICIARY TO TRAVEL TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THREE HUNDRED MILES IN SOME INSTANCES I MEAN THOSE ARE THE MOST EGREGIOUS BUT- THAT'S STILL SIGNIFICANT FOR. A LOW INCOME INDIVIDUAL- HEALTHCARE SERVICES HAVE THE ABILITY. TO REQUIRE. THESE NETWORK- CERTIFICATION CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS AND AS PART OF THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY THE PLAN HAS THE ABILITY- DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES HAS THE ABILITY REQUIRE THAT PLAN AT LEAST ON A TEMPORARY BASIS. UNTIL YOU CAN GET MORE PROVIDERS TEN CHILE INTO THE INTO THE NETWORK TO ALLOW THIS BENEFICIARY TO GO OUT OF NETWORK THAT MADE REQUIRE. PAYING MORE TO THAT PARTICULAR PROVIDER BUT IT'S LESSENING THE BURDEN ON THE BENEFICIARY NOW THAT IF YOU'RE SURE ONLY TRAVEL THIRTY OR FORTY MILES. AS OPPOSED TO MAKING A DECISION AS TO WHETHER NOT TRAVEL TO WANT. TO KEEP AND CASE THEY WON'T TAKE CARE BECAUSE. THAT'S JUST TOO FAR HAS ANYBODY DOING NOW. THIS TIME. EXAMPLES OF. TO THE BENEFICIARIES- THAT'S WHY WE MADE THAT RECOMMENDATION THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE OTHER PART HEALTH CARE SERVICES NEEDS TO- REQUIRE PLANS TO ALLOW THAT TO THAT OUT OUT OF NETWORK CARE. THANK YOU FOR THAT WELL I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME IF THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO AT LEAST PROVIDE THE- IF YOU KNOW THE BASIC CARE AND THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PROVIDERS. WE NEED TO TRY TO FORCE THAT IN SOME WAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR EXPANDING ON IT. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND- AND- IT AND YOUR PORT AND SO- MODE NOW I'M GOING TO ASK- THIS DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES- TO COME UP SO THANKS VERY MUCH. OTHER HEALTH AND- THANK YOU MEMBERS THANKS MUCH. ALL RIGHT SO- NEXT UP WE HAVE- DEPARTMENT. OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES WE HAVE- ACTING DIRECTOR- RICHARD FIGUEROA AND- CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS MAIN CAT. CAN'T WELL WELCOME AND. THE CREE SHEET HERE. RESPONSE TO THE AUDITOR'S FINDINGS I KNOW WE HAVE THE MORE FORMAL RESPONSE BUT MAYBE A SUMMARY AND MAYBE SOME DISCUSSIONS ALONG WILL ANSWER SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE PERHAPS RAISED IN THE QUESTIONS AS WELL- THAT WOULD PASS THE AUDITOR THANK YOU. GREAT AGAIN- MORNING MR CHAIR AND MEMBERS A COMMITTEE MADE WHICH FIGARO ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE PALM HEALTHCARE SERVICES THE DHS TAKES THE FINDINGS OF THE AUTHORS MEDI CAL REGIONAL REPORT SERIOUSLY IS WORKING DILIGENTLY NAMEPLATE MOSTLY ACTION ITEMS AS OUTLINED IN THE RESPONSES- OUT ALSO NOTE THAT THE STAFF- RIVER A COLLABORATIVELY- WITH THE AUDITORS- STAFF AS WELL AND IN PRODUCING THIS. I'M JUST SOME REAL QUICK BACKGROUND CONTEXT YOU TOUCHED ON THIS A LITTLE BIT EARLIER- DHS COOLEY PROVIDES CARED ABOUT THIRTEEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS THROUGH SIX DIFFERENT DELIVERY SYSTEMS INCLUDING MULTIPLE MANAGE CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM AS YOU NOTED EARLIER FEE FOR SERVICE DENTAL COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH DRUG MEDI CAL ORGANIZED LIVVIE SYSTEM AND COUNTY SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS SERVICES. WE OPERATE SIXTY FOUR MILES A MANAGE CARE- AND CONTRACTOR TWENTY FOUR FULL SCOPE MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS 82% OF MEDI CAL ENROLLEES ARE RECEIVING CARE TO MANAGE CARE FIND TWENTY THIRTEEN AS WAS NOTED EARLIER DHS EXPANDED MATCH CARE TWENTY EIGHT ADDITIONAL COUNTIES TO CLEAN EIGHTEEN COUNTIES THAT COMPRISE THAT WITH CALL THE REGIONAL MODEL- THOSE EIGHTEEN CANS ARE GENERALLY THE FOCUS OF THE AFTER MENTIONED BY THAT ANTHEM BLUE CROSS IN CALIFORNIA HELP THE WILL OF THE TO MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE. IN THEM WITH RESPECT THE AUDIT FINDINGS THEMSELVES IN TIME SAYS TO CARE AND PROVIDER BEING A REASONABLE DISTANCE ALL THESE RESIDENT STATUTORY AND TAX REQUIREMENTS. COMMENTS HEALTHCARE PLANS. AND T. H. OF COURSE HAVE CHALLENGES. I FELT LIKE THAT WAS USUALLY. HI MARY APARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES YOU GUYS YOU KNOW I'M ALWAYS LIKE THIS BUT IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU- NOT IT'S BEEN AWHILE SINCE WE HAVEN'T HAD BUDGET HEARINGS IN AWHILE BUT IT'S NICE TO SEE A DOCTOR PAN AND ALSO SENATOR RUBIO I AM SO YEAH SO WANT TO USE THE REST OF MY TIME I KNOW. YOU GUYS HAVE A LOT TO COVER IN THE AGENDA TODAY SO YOU KNOW I TRY TO BE LET GIVE GET YOU WHAT YOU NEED IN AS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE I AM SO JUST A COUPLE OF KEY THINGS TO IDENTIFY- WHERE WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS AND I THINK YOU HEARD SOME OF THAT FROM OUR AGAIN OUT OUR OUR PARTNERS AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR WHO AGAIN. JUST A REALLY APPRECIATE THE TIME THEY WITH US AS WE TRY TO WORK THROUGH HELPING THEM UNDERSTAND THE PROGRAM AND THEN MAKING SURE ANSWERING THEIR QUESTIONS AND FELT LIKE WE HAD A GOOD RELATIONSHIP AND WORKING THROUGH THAT ANSWERED ONLY APPRECIATE THAT AND THAT THAT WAS OVER AT THE DEPARTMENT. IN TERMS OF. THE VERY SPECIFIC. FINDINGS ON. WHERE WE. SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS AS WE CONTINUE OF COURSE THOUGH TO HAVE ON GOING IMPROVEMENTS. SO WITH RESPECT TO THE ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARDS A PROCESS. WE HAVE INSTITUTED- ESSENTIALLY A MORE SPECIFIC A PROCESS BY WHICH- HEALTH PLANS WOULD BE ABLE TO REQUEST ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARDS. BEING VERY CLEAR WHERE THEY COULD NOT WHAT THEY HAD TO DO BEFORE THEY COULD EVEN DO THAT. I KNOW THERE BEEN QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW DO WE ALSO MAKE SURE CONSISTENCY AND STAFF TRAINING GIVEN. YOU KNOW THE SIGNIFICANT. AMOUNT OF THINGS THAT WE GET GIVEN AS YOU ALL KNOW THE MEDIC HOW PROGRAMS- SIGNIFICANT SIZE. SO IN TERMS OF A FEW OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE WE'VE ESTABLISHED PACIFIC REQUIREMENTS AROUND DETERMINING HOW THE PLAN HAS A- HOSPITAL. IS NOBLE OPTIONS. FOR CONTRACTING WITH PROVIDERS THROUGH THE- EXISTING REGULAR STANDARD. I WILL. NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE FROM FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IN IN WHAT WHAT PROPORTION OF. QUESTED STANDARDS WERE. APPROVED CERTAINLY SOME OF THEM WEREN'T. A COMPLETE BUT IT WAS ALSO THEY WEREN'T COMPLIANCE THEY HADN'T. ON THE WORK THAT WAS. OF ALL OF THE REQUEST IN THIS AREA WE APPROVED FIVE POINT FIVE PERCENT- I KNOW THAT THE QUESTION. A DOCTOR PAN TO JUST ONE AND SERVE TO FLAG THAT FOR YOU. WE HAVE ALSO ADDED PURSUANT TO OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE STATE AUDITOR THAT PLANS MUST DEMONSTRATE ATTEMPTS TO CONTRACT WITH AT LEAST TWO CLOSER PROVIDERS WITHIN THAT PROVIDER CATEGORY. I THINK WE HAVE THIRTY SIX DIFFERENT PROVIDER CATEGORIES THAT OBVIOUSLY WE WORK TO READ THAT ARE IN THE STATE STATUTE TODAY SO THEY HAD TO. WORK WITH THOSE DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY COULD NOT ACHIEVE REASONABLE CONTRACTS BEFORE THEY COULD EVEN REQUEST AN ALTERNATIVE ACCESS. REQUESTED THAT WAS IN PLACE- TWENTY NINETEEN AND AN IMPROVEMENT THAT WE MADE. WE HAVE- AGAIN IS BIG CREATED AND IMPLEMENTED THAT NEW PROCESS AS WELL SOME OTHER THINGS FOR THE JULY SUBMISSIONS THAT WE DID FOR THIS YEAR'S- ODD- CERTIFICATIONS THAT WE SUBMIT TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT IT INCLUDES US DOING THAT US THAT SAMPLING OF CERTIFYING THAT THOSE REASONABLE ATTEMPTS HAVE. HAVE OCCURRED TO THE PLANS ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT DOCUMENTATION TO US- AS MENTIONED THERE ARE LOTS OF THEM SO WE TO HAVE DONE US A SAMPLING METHODOLOGY AND IF IN FACT IT'S DETERMINED EITHER THE PLAN DID NOT SUBMIT THE REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION OR THAT DOCTOR PATIENT ACTUALLY DEMONSTRATE. A REASONABLE ATTEMPT TO CONTRACT WITH ADDITIONAL PROVIDERS WE HAVE FOUND THOSE PLANS OUT OF COMPLIANCE THE INSTITUTE OF FINE SANCTIONS AND ARE REQUIRING THAT TO PROVIDE OUT OF NETWORK SERVICE AS. SO WE DO HAVE SOME OF THAT HAPPENING TODAY- AND WE DO A COUPLE OF THINGS TO CONTINUE TO ENFORCE THAT WE DO SECRET SHOPPING. TO MAKE SURE THAT IN FACT THE AVAILABILITY IN THE OFFERING OF OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDERS IS BEING GIVEN WHEN SOMEONE IS CALLING TO TRY TO ACCESS SERVICES AND WHEN THEY SEE IN THE PROVIDER DIRECTORY THESE FURTHER AWAY PROVIDERS THAT THERE IS KNOWLEDGE PROVIDED TO THEM. THAT THEY CAN MAKE A DIFFERENT CHOICE- WE DO ALSO HAVE IN PLACE. THAT WHAT WAS I. THAT OUT OF NETWORK YEAH THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY I KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS WITH THESE WITH THE AUDIT THE AUDIT TEAM ON THIS IS THAT UNFORTUNATELY THEY'RE ALSO CIRCUMSTANCES WORDS ALTHOUGH THERE ARE OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDERS IN THE AREA THEY MAY JUST NOT BE WILLING TO TAKE MEDI CAL PROVIDERS WHETHER MEDI CAL PATIENTSWHETHER IT'S FOR A GREAT SPACE OR OTHER BASIS WE KNOW WE DO HAVE PROVIDERS THAT- THAT JUST USED TO NOT WANT TO SEE OUR BENEFICIARIES. SO COUPLE OF THE OTHER CHANGES THAT I'VE DONE WE DO WE CAN NOW BEGIN POSTING THE MEDICAL UPDATES WITHIN A MONTH OF WHEN THEY'RE ISSUE TO THE PLANS AND NOT WAITING UNTIL THE CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN IS CLOSED WHAT. DO I DO BY NOW THROUGH YOU DO BROAD STAKEHOLDER BY WEEK BY MONTH LEASE NOT BY FRANKLY BYE BYE MONTHLY UPDATES THAT INCLUDE A LOT OF INFORMATION BUT THIS IS NOW INFORMATION THAT'S INCLUDED IN THOSE AS WELL AS ANY INFORMATION ABOUT. QUALITY DEFICIENCIES ACCESS DEFICIENCIES ANY. ANYTHING ELSE ENGINES ARE CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN. THESE UPDATES DO GO TO A VERY BROAD ARRAY OF. OF STAKEHOLDERS AND I'M GUESSING THE STAFF UP THERE ALL GET. WE GET THESE PROBABLY REGULARLY- ANYONE CAN SIGN UP. BUT TO REALLY RESPOND TO HOW DO WE MAKE SURE OUR COUNTY PARTNERS ARE ARE GETTING THIS INFORMATION GETTING IT IN THIS TIMELY WAY. WE HAVE WE DO HAVE GOOD PARTNERSHIPS THOUGHT THE COUNTY ASSOCIATIONS BUT THE SECOND SHE ACT. WHO WE WORKED WITH AND THEY'VE AGREED TO HELP MAKE SURE THAT THE COUNTY EXECUTIVE IS ANOTHER COUNTY ENTITIES REALLY KNOW THAT THIS THIS PROCESS. THIS INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AND A SIGN UP SO THAT THEY. CAN GET THAT ON THE REGULAR BASIS. THERE ARE ALSO QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW DO WE MAKE SURE COUNTIES IN PLANS AND OTHER INTERESTED. ENTITIES REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT MODEL TYPES AND HOW COULD I COUNTY OR A PLAN CHANGE MODEL TYPES WE DO HAVE SOME OF THAT INFORMATION ON OUR WEBSITE TODAY. BUT WE ARE COMMITTED AND TAP PROVIDING EVEN MORE OF THAT IN MORE DETAIL AND HAVING THAT POSTED TO OUR WEBSITE BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. AND SOME WILL DEFINITELY MAKE SURE TO. TO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH OBVIOUSLY THE COMMITTEES HAVE THAT AS WELL AS OUR OUR OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE. WE ALSO ARE- AS DISCUSSED SORT OF IN THE BEGINNING PROCESS OF AN ARE A FEW THAT WILL BE RELEASED NEXT YEAR. AND WE WILL BE LOOKING TO MAKE SURE THAT PLANS AND COUNTIES. ARE AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON THROUGH THE ARE FEW PROCESS. AND IF THEY WISH TO CHANGE PLAN MODEL YPES TO LET US KNOW SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND HOW THAT MIGHT IMPACT THE R. F. P. OR EVEN DURING OUR- PROCESS HOW CHANGES COULD BE MADE ABOUT WHO'S APPLYING TO DO WHAT KIND OF. WHAT KIND OF PLAN AND IF WE ARE MADE AWARE OF REQUEST I KNOW WE'VE WE'VE HAD SOME MEETINGS WITH SPECIFIC COUNTIES WHO HAVE HAD THIS INTEREST- WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THOSE. THOSE COUNTIES AND THOSE PLANS ON ON ON NECESSARY STEPS FOR THAT AND HOW THAT HOW THAT MIGHT PLAY OUT. I'M AS I WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE AUDIT REPORT THERE WERE SPECIFIC INSTANCES OF ACCESS CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED AND SO WE HAVE CONTRACTED. ADDED TO OUR CONTRACT WITH OUR EXTERNAL QUALITY REVIEW ORGANIZATION ARE EACH YOU ARE. TO REALLY DEVELOP AND VALIDATE WHAT WERE THOSE ACTIVE SITE. ISSUES IDENTIFIED WHAT COULD BE THE POTENTIAL CAUSES FOR THOSE. IS IT RELATED TO THE ALTERNATE ACCESS CONCERNS OR OTHER OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE GOING ON. SO THAT WE CAN THEN. HAVE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO INFORM HOW WE MIGHT BETTER. STREAMLINED AND HELP PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ENCOURAGE OTHER WAYS THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE HAVING APPROPRIATE ACCESS FOR OUR BENEFICIARIES. NO YOU ALSO HAD- A QUESTIONS ABOUT THE GROUPING OF THE EIGHTEEN COUNTIES AND REALLY WHERE THAT CAME FROM. I WILL SAY. I WAS NOT DEEPLY PERSONALLY INVOLVED IN THAT DECISION MAKING AT THE TIME. BUT KNOWING FROM TALKING TO THE STAFF THAT WERE HERE. AND MY UNDERSTANDING OF IT THERE REALLY A FEW REASONS. ONE BEING THAT WE DID HAVE THESE TWENTY EIGHT COUNTIES THAT ARE LOOKING. MOVE INTO MANAGED CARE. THERE WERE EIGHT THAT PARTNERSHIP HEALTH PLAN WAS INTERESTED IN PUTTING IN. YOUR DESK AT THAT TIME. THE OTHER OFFICE WERE NOT THEY'RE NOT CONTINUE SO. OR THEY OR THEIR FATE OR THAT THAT CODE THAT. WE THEN OF THE OF MEANING THESE TEAMS ARE CONTINUOUS SO IT REALLY PROVIDED A WAY TO. ADD A REGIONAL LIES MODEL. THAT ONE WOULD MAKE SURE THAT HEALTH PLAN TO CHOSE WHO CHOSE TO TRY TO ENTER INTO THIS AREA WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT POPULATION. TO REALLY MAINTAIN THE AND ADMINISTRATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE NETWORK IN THE SERVICE DELIVERY THAT THEY NEED AS WELL AS FROM THE STATE ADMINISTRATIVE SIDE OF DEVELOPING RATES. WE'VE HAD YOU KNOW DOCTOR CAN I KNOW YOU AND I TALKED A LOT ABOUT RATE SETTING IT IS COMPLICATED AND THE SMALLER THE NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUALS IS REALLY HARD TO THEN GET ACCURATE RATES. SO IT WAS A COMBINATION OF THOSE THINGS- AND THEN REALLY WITH RESPECT TO OUR UPCOMING PLAN REFER CHAIRMAN I TOUCHED ON IT EARLIER. BUT WE ARE AS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED WILL BE RECURRING. RE PROCURING ALL OF OUR- COMMERCIAL MANAGED CARE CONTRACTS. AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE- THAT ARE RELEASED IN THE SECOND HALF OF TWENTY TWENTY IT AFFECTS THIRTY SIX COUNTIES SEXUALLY ANY NON COAST COUNTY. RIGHT THERE'S A COMMERCIAL PLAN IN EVERY ON BECAUSE COUNTY. AND SO THAT THAT WILL BE RELEASED IN IN THE SECOND HALF OF NEEDS HE- CERTAINLY. ISSUES OF QUALITY AND ACCESS ARE CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF WHAT THAT ARE OF PEOPLE BE LOOKING. LOOKING AT HOW CAN WE EVALUATE OUR PLANS ABILITY TO HAVE CONTRACT. AND WHETHER AND DO THEY NEED TO BE DOING OF NETWORK. BUT SHE. DOES NOT SERVICES COULD YOU TELL HEALTH WHICH. CORD IMPORTANT THANK YOU FOR THEIR CONTRACT WITH OUR SAFETY NET EDITORS ARE ARE FQHCS ARE ARE EACH SEASON ARE. OUR TRIBAL PROVIDERS WHO. ARE IN SOME OF THESE PLACES LIKE THE KEY CORE COMPONENT OF WHERE PEOPLE CAN PROVIDE GET ACCESS. TO THOSE WILL CERTAINLY BE KEY ELEMENTS. WE ARE STILL IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE R. F. P. DOING A REALLY REALLY A WHOLE REASSESSMENT OF THE ENTIRE MANAGED CARE CONTRACT. IT HASN'T HAD THAT SORT OF FULL LOOK WE'VE HAD WE'VE HAD THINGS ADDED IN BUT IF YOU ACTUALLY READ THROUGH IT SOMETIMES THINGS SEEM TO BE IN WEIRD PLACES SO PART OF ITS CLEANING THAT UP SO. IT'S MORE UNDERSTANDABLE NOT JUST TO US IN OUR PLANS BUT TO THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE INTERESTED LOOKING AT WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE. AS WELL AS THE REQUIREMENTS THAT WE THINK WE NEED TO BE ADDING. UP BOTH JUST FROM OUR OWN EXPERIENCE BUT CERTAINLY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ANY AUDIT FINDINGS THAT HAVE BEEN OCCURRING OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. AS WELL AS WE HAVE HAD INPUT FROM SEVERAL. COLORED ORGANIZATIONS WHO HAVE ALREADY BEEN PROVIDING. INPUT AN INSIGHT INTO WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE. AND THEN OF COURSE WE DID I'M SURE YOU HEARD ABOUT OUR RELEASE OF CAL AIM. LAST WEEK WHICH IS OF COURSE A VERY BROAD PROPOSAL ON THE MEDIC HOW PROGRAM BUT ANY. FINAL DECISIONS ON WHAT WILL BE IN CALLING AIM AND HOW THEY AFFECT MANAGED CARE PLANS THOSE WOULD ALSO GO INTO THE NEW CONTRACTS AS WELL- PRIOR TO THE- EAST. THE R. F. P. SO REALLY WERE WERE TARGETING THE FIRST QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY. TWO TO RELEASE OUT TO FOLKS. A LIST OF THE SUMMARY OF THE CHANGES WHETHER THAT'S- MODIFICATIONS DELETIONS MOSTLY ADDITIONS. NOT SO MUCH OF THE REGION'S UNLESS THEY'RE NO LONGER RELEVANT. SO THAT THE STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY AND LEGISLATURE CAN HAVE CAN HAVE THAT CHANCE REALLY PROVIDE US INPUT ON OTHER THINGS THAT ARE MISSING THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE IMPROVING SO THAT WE CAN. TAKE THAT ACTON INCORPORATED INTO THE FINAL ARE A FEW. THAT AS I SAID WILL BE RELEASED AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY. I AM I KNOW THERE WAS A QUESTION YEAH THE ISSUE OF DIRECT PROVIDER DIRECTORIES WITH WAS REYES HERE AT. IT IS A QUESTION IN THE LATER SECTION AS WELL BUT I FIGURED I WOULD JUST. DO THE ANSWER NOW SO WE DO HAVE WE HAVE MODIFIED OUR CONTACT WITH ARE YOU Q. RO. TO BE TO BE DOING PROVIDER DIRECTORY VALIDATION THEY WILL BEGIN DOING THAT IN JANUARY AND WE'RE LOOKING AT BEING ABLE TO HAVE SOME OF THOSE INITIAL RESULTS IN THAT FIRST QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY. AND THEN HAVE THAT HAVE HAVE THEM DOING THAT ON GOING SO THAT WE ARE IMPROVING AND HAVING PEOPLE HAVE A PROVIDER DIRECTORY THAT ACCURATELY REFLECTS WHO THEY CAN THEY CAN SEE. SO I THINK WITH THAT ALL AND I KNOW. GOT A LOT OF TRYING TO. KEEP WITHIN MY TIME. I WILL JUST FINALLY SAY THAT YOU KNOW NOT TO SPEAKING FOR MYSELF AND FOR THE DIRECTOR BUT FOR THE TEAM THAT'S HERE IN THE TEAM THAT WORKS ON THIS. WE DO THESE JOBS BECAUSE WE CARE ABOUT THE MEDI CAL POP YOU CAN AND- WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. AND HAVE THAT BE QUALITY AND TIMELY. AND SO WE ARE COMPLETELY PASSIONATE AND COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO DO THAT. AS MUCH AS WE POSSIBLY CAN. YOU KNOW THERE ARE CHALLENGES AND A BIG PROGRAM AND- MEANING AND ALL OF THOSE TYPES OF THINGS THAT EXISTS BUT- BUT YOU. COMMITMENT FROM AUSTIN ALL OF US BACK IN THE DEPARTMENT WHO. WHO WE DO THESE JOBS BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT WE CARE ABOUT DOING SO WITH THAT I'M- HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS OR HAVE THE DIRECTOR ANSWER QUESTIONS WHATEVER. WHATEVER WORKS FOR YOU GUYS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION- JUST THE CLIP AT THE TECHNICAL QUESTION TO CLARIFY. THAT IS THAT YOU MENTIONED AT ALL THE COMMERCIAL PLANES. ARE UP FOR OUR P. IN TWENTY TWENTY BUT DODD OR MENTION ANTHEM ISN'T UP TO TWENTY TWENTY THREES. CONTINUE CLARIFIES SURE YEAH. SO THAT WE'RE RELEASING THE R. F. P. IN TWENTY TWENTY. FOR ALL THIRTY SIX COUNTIES THE EFFECTIVE DATES OF WHEN THOSE NEW CONTRACTS WOULD GOING TO PLEASE. US OUR TWENTY TWENTY THREE IN SUMMER TWENTY TWENTY FOUR JUST DEPENDING ON THE CURRENT CONTRACT PLANTS BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. OKAY SO THE OUR FEES GOING OUT SO EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT THE ACTUAL CHANGE RIGHT BECAUSE READING OF SELECTION AND READY NESS AND ALL OF THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN OKAY SO YES IT WILL TAKE A FEW THE ACTUAL. IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW PLANS WON'T HAPPEN UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR OKAY IT'S MY CLEAR FIGHT YES CENTER RUBIO. THANK YOU. I BELIEVE YOU STATED EARLIER WITHOUT- YOU'VE ALREADY MADE SOME CHANGES BASED ON THE ON A RECOMMENDATION. AND DIE YOU STATED THAT NOW. YOU HAVE A SAMPLE SAMPLING METHODOLOGY TO IS TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE MAKING. SENATE WHAT TENDS TO ATTRACT OUT NOT TELL ME ABOUT THE- METHODOLOGY WHO CREATED THAT IT. YOU'RE GETTING A LITTLE MORE DETAIL THAN THAT I MIGHT HAVE I HAVE FOR YOU FOR USE LET ME FOLLOW BACK UP WITH THAT IT REALLY IS GIVEN THE BREADTH OF. THE NUMBER OF PLANS WE HAVE NUMBER OF COUNTIES THAT BEING ABLE TO REVIEW EVERY SINGLE ONE IS A CHALLENGE AND SO WE I I'D HAVE TO CHECK BACK WITH MY STAFF ON. WHAT WAS A SEPARATE SAMPLING METHODOLOGY WE USED- AND OF COURSE OPEN TO REFINEMENTS THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE REALLY CAPTURING AN APPROPRIATE SAMPLE SO THAT WE KNOW IF THERE ARE LARGER PROBLEMS THAT EXIST BUT LET ME GET BACK TO YOU ON THE SPECIFIC DETAILS OF THAT METHODOLOGY. CAN'T THINK I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING YOUR- HE ALSO STATED THAT- NOW YOU'VE TAKEN- SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN YOUR POSTING. THE AUDIT BEFORE CORRECTION ACTION IS TAKEN- IS THERE A AN ESTABLISHED TIMELINE TO POLLSTERS AUDIENCE OR YOU'RE JUST. SURE YES SO YES SO WE- WE ARE POSTING THEM WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF ISSUING THEM TO THE HEALTH PLAN. THANK CANCER THAT'S SOMETHING. THANK YOU AT SEVERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT SOME SPECIFICS- REGARDING YOUR PRESENTATION- SO FIRST OF ALL YOU MENTIONED AND THE ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARD PROCESS THAT- THERE CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS YOU JUST MENTIONED REQUIREMENTS CAN YOU MORE% REQUIREMENTS- THAT ARE NEEDED FOR. THE A TO RECEIVE AN ALTERNATE. I GUESS AN ALTERNATE ACCESS STANDARD SURE WHAT WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO MEET IN ORDER TO JACQUI BE GRANTED ONE SURE SO THE TO VERY SPECIFIC ONES THAT I KNOW OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. ONE IS THE REQUIREMENT TO SUBMIT DOCUMENTATION ON THE EFFORTS THAT WERE MADE TO CONTRACT. THE SECOND BEING THAT THEY HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE AYE EVEN BEFORE THEY SUBMIT AN ALTERNATIVE ACCESS REQUIREMENT THAT THEY HAVE IN FACT TRIED TO CONTRACT AND WHAT WERE THE REASONS WHY THAT CONTRACT COULD NOT BE AFFECTED WAITED WITH A PARTICULAR PROVIDER AN AT A MINIMUM TO WITHIN EACH. CATEGORY OF THE THIRTY SIX OR HOWEVER MANY DIFFERENT PROVIDER TYPES WE HAVE THAT THAT THAT THAT DEMONSTRATION HAS BEEN DONE AND THE REASONS WHY THAT CONTRACT WAS NOT ABLE TO BE ENTERED INTO. OKAY THAT STILL SOUNDS A BIT VAGUE- SO WHAT KIND OF REASONS ARE ACCEPTABLE WHAT KIND OF REASONS WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED ACCEPTABLE SO THE PERSON REFUSE IT. SAID TO GIVE REASONS THAT'S FAR BUT WHAT REASON SO IT JUST SAY YOU KNOW WE OFFERED THEM THE STANDARD MEDI CAL RATE AND THEY SAID WAS TOO LOW SAID ACCEPTABLE. OUR KIDS ARE YOU ARE YOU REQUIRED TO OFFER A HIGHER RATE LIKE- FOR EXAMPLE AT LEAST MEDICARE OR ABOVE RIGHT I MEAN. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SO AT IT SO WHAT OR REASONS HOW MUCH WHAT KIND OF EFFORTS DO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO USE THE SAY THAT YOU ACTUALLY TRIED SUFFICIENTLY. WELL SENT THEM A LETTER DATED ANSWER I MEAN THAT TO ME WOULD BE THAT WOULD NOT BE REASON YEAH. CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME EXAMPLES OF THINGS YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO SHOWN YOU'VE DONE THAT DOCUMENT. THAT I WE TRIED A. B. C. AND D. AND. TELL ME WHAT KIND OF THINGS. DO THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO TRY THAT ARE CONSIDERED FOR THE REVIEWERS SAY- THEY ACTUALLY REALLY TRIED VERSES WELL YOU KNOW THAT WOULD NOT BE SUFFICIENT. SURE SO LET ME. JUST MAKE SURE WHAT I HAVE THE ANSWER THAT- AND THEN IF WE NEED TO AND I KNOW THERE WAS A REQUEST FOR OR THE PROCEDURES THAT WERE USING WE CAN PROVIDE THOSE TO YOU WE HAVE SOME COPIES WE CAN GIVE YOU TODAY BUT ALSO SEND USE THAT ALL THE MEMBERS HERE. I THINK I THINK THAT YOU KNOW CERTAINLY PROCEDURES SYSTEM SOMETHING WE WANT TO BE VERY INTERESTED BUT ALSO THE STANDARDS RIGHT THE MINIMUM STANDARDS PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO MEET AND ARE FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO SENSE AGAIN NOW THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SAYING SO WHAT WHAT IS IT THAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO. BEFORE. PART IN SAYS OKAY WELL USED. LOOKS LIKE WE ARE AT AN IMPASSE AND THE ARE ONLY ALTERNATIVE IS TO SAY ONE TWO HUNDRED MILES OR THREE HUNDRED MILES AWAY SURE SO THE THINGS THAT I CAN SPEAK TO MORE DIRECTLY AND THEN AGAIN I THINK HAPPY TO HAVEOF RATES WERE OFFERED WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC STANDARD ON IT HAS TO BE THIS KIND OF RATE OR THAT THAT NOT. AS YOU KNOW GREAT. FOR SERVICE AMERICA AND THEIR CAP DID SO A COMPARISON TO OTHER RATES- CAN BE A CHALLENGE BUT BUT REALLY LOOKING AT WHAT OTHER WHAT TYPES OF RIGHT. THEY ARE ARE THEY OFFERING WHAT THE RATE. DID THE- IF. OTHER IN THE COUNTY. DETAILS BUT WOULD BUT LET US HAVE THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW THAT BETTER THAN ME- THAT AND THEN WE CAN HAVE A FOR A FURTHER CONVERSATION OKAY SO. THAT'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT. IS WELL WHAT. I DID RATES SEND A COW AND WE HAD THE RATE SETTING HEARING AND HE KNOWS THE SAMPLE COSTA TESTIFIED TODAY PAID MEDICARE RATES WERE WHEN I THINK WAS ANTHEM WHO CAN'T OURS. DALY SAID THAT. SOMETIMES HAS TO DO WITH THE LEVEL OF- ESSENTIALLY OVERHEAD HIM MISS MEAN BURDEN ABSOLUTELY THE PLAN EXPECTS. OF THE SO WHICH OF COURSE RAISES THE COST. AT THAT CAN BE AN ISSUE AS WELL THERE'S OTHER REASONS AS WELL SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE NEED- WHAT HURTS WERE TAKEN TO TRUST RATES ADDRESS. YES AND. JEFF IS THAT PREVENT PEOPLE FROM CONTRACT WITH THIS PLAN SO I THINK THOSE MINIMUM STANDARDS ARE GOING TO BE IMPORTANT LIKE HOW IT ASIDE FROM JUST THE PROCESS HOW THE PEOPLE REVIEW IT WHAT. THIS S. A FOR NOW YOU COULD DO MORE. YOU TALKED ABOUT A REASONABLE CONTRACT. THE END A DEFINITE REASONABLE SO WHAT IS CAN YOU PROVIDE MORE SPECIFICITY IS TO WHAT'S REASONABLE AT A AT A L. I THINK WE HAVE ESTABLISHED IN THE STATE STANDARDS FOR ACCESS TO CARE AT THAT WORKS CLEARLY THE- REASONS. THAT'S THAT. THE STAND ESTABLISH REASONABLE HI. YEAH AND CERTAINLY I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THE ABILITY TO ALTERNATIVE ACCESS ALSO PART OF THE STATUTE IT RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE GOING TO BEAT THAT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO BE MAD AND I THINK THAT AGAIN CONTINUING IMPROVE NGUYEN BUT HOW HOW MORE OFTEN DO WE REQUIRE. OUT OF NETWORK ACCESS AND THEN. BURKE ACCESS ARE THOSE. DID YOU IN SO ALL ALL TOTALLY APPROPRIATE QUESTIONS EIGHT I DO THINK WE'VE MOVED WE'VE MOVED TO THE LINE AN IMPROVED IT BUT WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE IT AND I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A PARTICULAR. IS WITH YOU I THINK YOU CAN REALLY THINK ABOUT WHAT I THINK SHOULD BE HOW DO WE BE MORE SPECIFIC- I'M IN FROM AN ANALYTICAL PERSPECTIVE AND LESS OF THE SUBJECTIVE PERSPECTIVE SO I. SHEET THAT IN AND HAPPY TO CONTINUE. ANYTHING RESULT IMPORTANT FOR THE PLANS AND THAT'S ABSOLUTELY. THE CONTRACTS ARE THEY HAVE TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE WHAT IT'S BEING EXPECTED OF THEM AS WELL AND- AND TO WHAT DEGREE THAT THEY MAY BE EXPECTED TO HELP CREATE THE KIND OF NETWORKS THAT. WE WANT THEM. THE THAT'S TIED INTO COMMENTS THAT WERE WILLING TO PAY AS WELL SO- THAT'S SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT WHEN THE THINGS THE OTHER ALSO POINTED OUT WAS IN TERMS OF THE ACCOUNT COMMUNICATIONS A PRE SHEET DISEASE. YOU'RE PUTTING OUT THE- WHILE THE FINDINGS OF. WE SHOULDN'T PRIOR TO DOING CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS- WHAT ELSE I MEAN. IT I THINK THAT WHAT THE CHALLENGES OKAY THAT WE HAVE IS THAT- YEAH COUNTY. IN CALIFORNIA WE EXPECT THE COUNTIES SO DURING THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE WE EXPECT THE COUNTIES TO BASICALLY BE ON THE FRONT LINES THEY'RE THE ONES WHO ARE YOU KNOW AND ROLLING IN ELIGIBILITY AND FOR YOUR OFTEN TO PULL WHO. IF YOU FACE TURNED TO HELP FOR VISITS TO THE HAD THE CONTACT WITH THE THAT. AND SO WHAT KIND OF SAUCE. APPS ARE YOU PS TAKING TO TRY TO IMPROVE THAT PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COUNTY SO THE COUNTY CAN BE BETTER SO. YOU KNOW PLAN TYPE WE'LL GET TO THAT. BUT JUST THE COUNTY BEING ABLE TO. HELP. CONSTITUENTS WHO ARE ALSO OUR BENEFICIARIES TO PROVIDE BETTER SERVICES FOR THEM SO- IS BEYOND WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW I MEAN I HOPE THIS TRUE FATHER OF ART IS THAT IT IS. WELL ENCOURAGE THE DEPARTMENT TO ENGAGE AND PERHAPS SOME ARE PROACTIVE IN ROBUST PARTNERSHIP WITH COUNTIES PARTICULARLY A RURAL COUNTY SWITCHER SMALLER HAVE FEWER. RESOURCE ITSELF TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS SO. FOR MORE ON THE STATE AND- COUNTY THAT'S UP TO TAKE A MORE SLACK ON THEIR OWN SO WHAT IS WHAT ARE SOME THE THINGS THAT THE EIGHTY S. IS CONSIDERING IN TERMS OF MOVING THAT. WITH SEVERAL COUNTIES. SURE. SORT OF MORE BROADLY- WORKING WITH OUR COUNTY ASSOCIATIONS WITH BOTH THE SECOND SHE ACT ON HOW DO WE BETTER REACH THE COUNTY EXECUTIVE. AND THAT OUR BUSINESS AT AT HI TOWNIES. SHOUT YES WE HAVE HAD THOSE DISCUSSIONS WANT TO PROVIDE THAT TECHNICAL THE STATE. IN THINKING WHAT WHAT. THE OP WHAT THE CHALLENGES ARE. AND HOW WE MOVE FORWARD FROM THAT SO OF I WILL SO IF I WAS SOMEONE AND ROLL COUNTY. THE EXACT BUT THE PERSON WHO DID OVERSEE OUR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES- IS THERE A PARTICULAR PERSON I SHOULD REACH OUT TO INDEED CS TO TALK ABOUT MY CONCERNS ARE THINGS I NEED HELP WITH IT FOURTH THAT WHO THAT PERSON. SURE IT'S CERTAINLY ME MYSELF COULD BE THE DIRECTOR OR OR OR STE BROOKS. THREE OF US WOULD BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CONTACT. ALL RIGHT WELL YOU KNOW THAT ALL OF YOU ARE VERY BUSY THERE'S A LOT GOING ON. YES BUT I MEAN I. THE MORE PROACTIVE THAN SIMPLY. FOR YOU CALL US WHEN YOU NEED US I MEAN. I'M THINKING THAT PARTICULARLY WITH PEARL COUNTIES WHERE THERE'S FEWER STAFF. THERE'S PERHAPS RIGHT. THE MAYBE PEOPLE WERE VERY PLEASURABLE ABOUT THIS PROCESS BUT THAT GIVEN THE FACT THAT THEY USE OFTEN HAVE FEW RESOURCES OR LESS ABLE GET CONSULTANT STIR LIST ABLE THEY MAY NOT THEY MAY NOT NOW. TWO YES I HAVE AS MUCH EXPERIENCE POSSIBLY MAYBE NOT. ASSISTANCE THIS GUY AND WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY'RE NOT RUNNING THE THEY'RE NOT A BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT RUNNING THEIR OWN SYSTEM THEIR INTERFACING WITH MANAGED CARE PLANS TO THANK. AM TO GET THE CONTRACTS. TODAY THEY DON'T HAVE TO WRITE THEN I HAVE TO TYPE IT IT'S NOT LIKE THE COUNTY AS A SIGN UPS AS YET. AND WITH UPPER NO NOT RATE CORRECT. FOR DETAILS TO BE MORE PROACTIVE IN GETTING THEIR INPUT AND ALSO NOT JUST WAIT FOR THEM TO REACH OUT BUT ALSO SAY. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE ISSUES WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP. OUT TO BE SURE THAT THE PLAN. EXPECT THEM TO. YOU HAVE A MINUTE TO DO THAT. ALL RIGHTS AND- I CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM ANY RURAL COUNTY TO FEEL. DONE AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN WORK IN PARTNERSHIP BE SURE THEY'RE BETTER. I REALLY UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION. FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES- I BELIEVE IN THE AUDITOR'S REPORT TO CONCLUDED THAT THE REGIONAL MODEL BENEFICIARIES WOULD HAVE BETTER ACCESS TO MANAGED CARE THE TRANSITION OVER TO A COUNTY ORGANIZED HOLD SYSTEM EXPLAINED. CHECK YOUR ISSUE IF YOU AGREE WITH THAT. I MEAN I THINK A AYE AYE AYE. POSSIBLE I THINK THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AREAS OF THAT WERE BEING COMPARED TO IN IN IN SOME DIFFERENT WAYS TERMS OF WHAT SHIP. DOES AND HAS BEEN DOING AND WHAT THE TEAM'S. THAT WERE OUT LATE JOINT PARTNERSHIP MODEL. FROM THE PARTNERSHIP PERSPECTIVE- SO- EIGHT I DON'T NECESSARILY IF SUBSCRIBE TO THE IDEA THAT A PARTICULAR MODEL IS THE BEST ONE I THINK IT'S REALLY MAKE SURE WE HAVE PLANS WHO ARE MISSING IS THAT THEY NEED TO DO I THINK ALL OF THE WORK WE'RE DOING OR WERE. YOU IN CAL ABOUT THING THAT AND SO THAT YOU AREN'T SEEING DIFFERENT IS A OF THESE PLAN MODEL TYPES- SO A. B. YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T NECESSARILY SAY THE CODES MODEL IS ALL THE. BEST MY I THINK WE DO OTHER MODEL SUPPER BETTER. ALL COAST PLANS ARE SOME OF OUR BETTER PLANS WE ALSO DEFINITELY HAVE OTHER LOCAL PLANS WE HAVE KAISER WE HAVE OTHERS ALSO PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT ACCESS AND SO. I DON'T. REALLY YOU KNOW PRESCRIBE THAT ONE PARTICULAR MODEL IT'S HOW WE ASSESS WHAT THE NEEDS OF THAT REGION ARE. AND HOW WE ALSO HAVE PLANS THAT ARE INTERESTED. IN DOING WORK IN THOSE REGIONS AND THEN HOW TO BE HOLD THEM ALL CAN. BE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE STATE THAT WE'VE ALL SAID ARE NECESSARY FOR BENEFICIARIES. WELL. SUGGESTIONS ON HOW WE CAN IMPROVE SERVICES. WHAT WOULD BE YOUR TOP. TAKE BACK. I THINK GEN AND I CAN WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET A COPY OF THE CAL A PROPOSAL WHICH WAS RELEASED LAST TUESDAY I THINK GENERALLY AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL I THINK THE WAY THAT WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE MEDICAID OR MEDICARE ON CALIFORNIA'S. PACIFIC OKAY MORE BROUGHT. ARE YOU WITH. HI JUST AS THE BALL. POPULATIONS CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS THE HOMELESS- AND PERSONS THAT THAT UTILIZE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS A LOT AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ADDRESS THE HEALTH THE HEALTH SYSTEM CAN'T COVER IS NOT EVERYTHING A CAN'T BE EVERYTHING WITH ME DOING A LOT MORE THAN THIS RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF LINKING. PEOPLE THAT HAVE HEALTH ISSUES TWO OTHER SERVICES LIKE THE WHOLE PERSON CARE A WHOLE PERSON CAUGHT BOTTLE SO I THINK ONE THING FOR SURE WE- EXPAND OR- CHANGE AMERICA PROBLEM IS THEY HAVE A MORE WHOLE PERSON APPROACH. AND LOOK AT THE SOCIAL. MAKE SURE THEY HAVE ACCESS TO- A FOOD RESOURCES FOR EXAMPLE MAY. HELP DIGITAL SYSTEMS THINGS THAT ARE GONNA HELP STABILIZE THE MORE BROADLY THAT THEN IMPACTS OUR HEALTH POSITIVELY SO I THINK WE TRY TO TAKE A BROADER LOOK. AT AT HEALTH BEING JUST NOT THE CARD. ITSELF BUT THE KIND OF. BACK THAT PERSON'S LIFE THAT AFFECT THEIR HEALTH THAT'S ONE THING. THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. CONTACTS AND SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE SEEING- COMING TO LATER THIS YEAR WE ARE WE'VE ALREADY RELEASED THE LEAD SELF WAS OBVIOUSLY AND MAIN LEGISLATION AND YOU'RE POPPING HAVE A MEASURE WHERE MORE SPECIAL HEARINGS I'M GUESSING ON THIS. GOING TO BE ABLE TO. YEAH. IT'S A KIND OF MORE BROADLY MANY DIFFERENT EL. THURMOND THOSE THINGS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO. FOR A GRAY ASSEMBLY OF BROUGHT ACROSS THE COLD MEDI CAL- THAT WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT WE'D LIKE TO INCORPORATE MORE AND I WOULD ADD TO THAT I THINK THE POLICE WHERE WE HAVE THAT LEAST OF THAT TODAY JUST GIVE IN WEARABLE PERSON CARE. HAS BEEN WHERE THE MONEY BEEN FOR THAT OBVIOUSLY IN THE- BUDGET. THE HUNT DOLLARS FOR. SERVICES THE HOUSING SERVICES. HAVING PLACES FOR RECRUITMENT OF CARE SOBERING CENTERS- HOW DO WE DO BETTER TRANSITIONS OUT OF. OUT OF NURSING FACILITIES OR OTHER INSTITUTIONS. BUT AS IS BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THAT WE- HAD IT. AGAIN IS PROPOSED IN THE CAL AIM PROPOSAL AND WHY IT WILL NEED. ABOUT UP FROM A BUDGETARY AND LEGISLATIVE PERSPECTIVE HOW DO WE MOVE THAT NEEDLE. WE FOR TO BUILD. STRONG THERE REALLY IS NECESSARY OF THOSE COUNTY. NOT AS MUCH AND NOT AS MUCH CAPABILITY SO HOT FROM REGIONALIZATION OR OTHER THINGS THAT WE CAN DO AND THAT WE CAN SUPPORT AT THE STATE LEVEL TO HELP THEM. WE THEN HAVE THOSE BEST PRACTICES WE'VE SEEN. SMALLER COUNTIES PLASTER COUNTY IS ONE OF OUR TOP THE WHOLE PERSON CARE ENTITIES WHO'VE DONE A LOT GOT CUTS YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF PEOPLE FROM THEIR POPULATION INTO SUPPORT OF HOUSING SUPPORT OF SERVICES THAT IN THE END IS GOING TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE. THAT TALKING ABOUT. THAT THE FUTURE OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO IT IS BIG BROAD AT THAT HAS STATUTORY IN BUDGETARY CONSIDERATIONS THAT WILL ALL NEED TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT BUT IT IS SOMETHING WE- EXCITED ABOUT ANYTHING. GET THE KNACK. OF A MEDICAL PROGRAM IT IS MORE WE WANT IT TO BE REALLY FILLING IN THOSE GAPS THAT EXIST TODAY. IS THE CAL GAME ALL RIGHT ONLINE OR DO YOU NEED TO PROVIDE. IT IS THERE'S A WEBSITE. YOU HAVE A AS ABOUT HOLD AID ON TELLING HIM THAT WE DID SHARE OUT BOTH WITH OUR LEGISLATIVE STAFF AS WELL AS THE BROADER STAKEHOLDER- WE DID HAVE OUR INITIAL KICK OFF SO THERE'S A LONG PAPER IF YOU WANT TO. UNDER NEW PAGES SETS ON THE ON THE. PROVIDE WHATEVER ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. TO YOU ALL AS AS NECESSARY AND APPROPRIATE I KNOW WE DID. SO ONE WITH WITH THE STAFF- ON MONDAY WE DID HAVE OUR LARGER STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS THAT WE BOTH HAVE A OVERALL ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FOCUS STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY COMMITTEE WILL THAT BE RELEASED AND HAD WE WALK THROUGH. HOURS OF CONVERSATION WITH THEM AND THEN WE'VE KICKED. THE MULTI. WE HAVE LIKE A SIX A TWELVE PAGE WILL MAKE SURE YOU GET. ORDER READER SO USERS. REMIND THE HUNDRED PAGE IF YOU CAN. AND ALL OF THEM. AT ALL THANK YOU THAT'S IT THANK. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO I APPRECIATE THE VISION- AND CERTAINLY- SUPPORTIVE OF THAT SOMEONE WHO IS THE BACKGROUND PUBLIC HEALTH AND CERTAINLY- APPRECIATES THE SOCIAL TERMS HEALTH. WHICH BUT ALSO MEANS WE NEED TO GET THE FUNDAMENTALS RIGHT- SO RIGHT AND SO WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO- WE NEED TO BE SURE PEOPLE CAN GET ACCESS SO YES. ACCESS TO HEALTH. ANY PERCENT WE HAVE ANOTHER. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU REALLY NEED IT. CAN'T GET IT WHICH IS THE ISSUE THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH IN THE AUDITOR'S REPORT OF THE NEEDS OF SPECIALTY CARE TO CAN'T GET IT THE PRIMARY CARE TO CAN'T GET AT THAT'S A PROBLEM- WE HAVEN'T TOUCHED ON BE. SO THAT'S WITHIN THE DOMAIN OF THE EIGHTY S. RIGHT AND WE'VE HAD IS HEARINGS AROUND THAT AND THEN WE TO MORE TALK ABOUT SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT ACCESS AS WELL SO. EVEN WITHIN THE REALM OF HELP. WE STILL HAVE A LOT. THIS IS PARTICULARLY CUTE IN A RURAL COUNTY SWITCHES ARE WHAT THIS AUDIT REPORT. STILL WITH I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT- APPRECIATE- YOU'RE SHARING THE TIMELINE THAT- WE DO PLAN TO HAVE ANOTHER INFORMATIONAL HEARING TO TALK ABOUT. WHAT'S GOING ON WITH MANAGED CARE IN THIS REVIEW OF THE R. P. AND SO FORTH AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR- SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM STAKEHOLDERS AND ALSO GIVING YOU. SOME OF OUR THOUGHTS RELATION TO- TO THE PART IS GOING FORWARD WITH- THE OTHER THING I. WANT TO TOUCH- IS THAT AS I KNOW THE STREET PUTTING TOGETHER THE BUDGET- FOR NEXT YEAR- WE TALKED IT OUT. REPORT REFER TO DIFFERENT MANAGED CARE MODELS I KNOW DIRECT. SIX MADE REFERENCE TO THAT WELL I DON'T THINK THAT NESTLE CHANGING MODELS. SOLVES ALL THE PROBLEMS- I DO THINK THAT COUNTIES COULD USE SOME ASSISTANCE AND THINKING ABOUT DIFFERENT MODELS- SOME WHICH I UNDERSTAND THE PERHAPS REQUIRED LEGISLATION IF WE WANT TO EXPAND KOS BUT THERE'S ALSO OTHER. IS AS WELL. AND EVEN WE STAYED WITH A HE'S NOT. PLAN WHAT. ARE SOME OF THE CHARACTERISTICS- SO EVEN WITHIN EACH MODEL REALLY WHAT THE DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS ARE PERHAPS PROVIDING MORE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO COUNTY SO THEY CAN HAVE MORE GUIDANCE- IN IN THAT IS DO YOU SEE THAT AS BEING SOMETHING THAT THE PART HEALTHCARE SERVICES WILL BE ASKING IN THE BUCKET TO SOME FUNDING BY PLEASE WITH CLOSEST FOR. ARE FOUND OUT BE ABLE TO. EXAMINE OUR EVEN WORK WITH THE MODELS THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY DEALING WITH- IN TERMS OF BEING YOU CAN BE ABLE TO WORK MORE EFFECTIVE. IN MAKING MEDI CAL WORK FOR THE RESIDENTS OF THEIR COUNTY I WOULD SAY THAT I MEAN WE OBVIOUSLY TOOK. AT OF THE RECOMMENDATION I THINK- SOMETIMES. I WISH THEY HAD A YES NO MAYBE SO BOX TECH- AND THE OTHER WAY WE RESPOND THE OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS BUT- I'M WE HAVE TAKEN NOTE OF THAT- I'M GONNA. THE OAKS ARE POOR OF IN TERMS OF THE LEGISLATURE'S IN THE HONORS INTEREST IN SEEING THOSE SPECIAL RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE. COMMA BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE GOVERNOR IS GOING TO DO. OWNERS OFFICE TO DO BUT IT'S REALLY CAMINO WE CERTAINLY HAVE NOTED THAT IT'S IT WAS A REQUEST AND SOMEONE TAKE A LOOK AT INTERNALLY. ALRIGHT WELL I WILL URGE I THINK THE OTHER RECORDS HAS POINTED OUT INDEED FOR THE S. AND I WOULD URGE THAT. SOME RESOURCES AS PRIDE PRIZE A PERCENTAGE THE ENTIRE MEDI CAL BUDGET RIGHT ABA LEAKY MUCH MUCH MUCH LESS THAN THE ANNUAL VARIATION THAT MEDI CAL EXPERIENCES FROM YEAR TO YEAR ALTHOUGH I KNOW WORKING HARD TO TRY AND THEIR OF THAT- BUT I THINK THAT. GIVEN SOME OF THE FINDINGS AND THE TWO AUDITS FORGET DOING AT A GIVEN THE NATURE OF AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY TAKING THIS ON WERE LET'S LOOK AT THE WHOLE MEDI CAL PROGRAM AND HOW DO YOU PROVE IT YOU'RE REVIEWING ALL THE OUR FEES. WE NEED TO BE SURE THE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND TO. YOU KNOW- ACTUALLY FACING. BEEN FISHERIES OF THE OTHER DAY- ROLLING NUMBER GIVING ASSISTANCE. HAVE SOME HELP IN BEING ABLE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND ALSO PERHAPS. HAVE A BIT MORE SAY IN. THE FUTURE OF MEDICARE HOW THAT'S INTERCOUNTY SO. LET'S PUT IT THAT WAY.

SO WE MAKE EVERY EFFORT WHETHER IT'S LOOKING AT. PROVIDER THAT WE HAVE A SINGLE CASE AGREEMENT AGREEMENT. NUMBER ACT I MEDI CAL MEMBER- PROVIDER WITH WITH ANTHEM. SO WE'VE DONE AS MUCH AS WE THINK WE HAVE. BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH AS FAR AS GETTING MAXIMUM ACCESS. TO OUR MEMBERS FROM OUR FOR SUMMER KANSI LOOKING AT. MAXIMIZING THAT I KNOW THE AUDIT HAD SAID WE HAVE THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED PROVIDERS AND WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THESE ARE EIGHTEEN INDIVIDUAL UNIQUE COUNTIES- THE NINETEEN HUNDRED THAT WE- HAVE NOT. CONTRACTED WITH I ACTUALLY LOOKED AT THE BOARD WEBSITE TODAY. TO TRY TO LOOK AT LIKE INYO COUNTY HOW MANY PROVIDERS ARE IN THERE. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO KNOW IF THOSE PROVIDERS TO MEDIC NOW. IF THEY ARE ACTUALLY HOSPITAL IS PROVIDERS VERSES SPECIALIST. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE A LIST OF THOSE NINETEEN HUNDRED. CONTACT I THEN I CAN GUARANTEE. YOU CAN LOOK AT. BUT BUT AGAIN TO IT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT AND MY- TO BE THAT THOSE NINETEEN HUNDRED. A WILL TAKE MEDI CAL HAVE AN OPEN PANEL ARE SPECIALISTS VERSUS PATHOLOGIST VERSES RADIOLOGISTS. SO SOME ADDITIONAL WORK ON THE ON THE AUDIT AND I KNOW IN TABLE. THREE IT DOES LOOK AT QUALITY. QUALITY OF CARE AND I STILL WANTED TO UNDERSCORE THE TABLE THREE THAT- AS FAR AS HE TO SCORES GO TO TWENTY TWO SCORES THAT THE A CS HOLD US ACCOUNTABLE FOR. ANTHEM HAVE THE LOWEST NUMBER OF MEASURES THAT WERE. BELOW MINIMUM PERFORMANCE SOME OF IT FOR HE TO STAMP POINT OUT THEM IS ACTUALLY. A BETTER PERFORMING QUALITY THAN PARTNERSHIP AND HEALTH AND WELLNESS. THAT WERE WERE BEING COMPETITIVE BUT I DO THE HIGHLIGHT. QUANTIFIABLE HE THIS. PERFORMANCE WHICH IS WHAT I'LL TO ACROSS THE STATE. SCORES ARE ON PAR WITH OTHER PLANS IN IN THE LOCAL MARKET SO I STILL QUESTION THE FACT THE QUALITY OF CARE IS NOT ADEQUATE- WITH OUR PLAN- WHEN IT COMES TO ACCESS I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT YOU KNOW THE ALTERNATE ACCESS STANDARDS WITH SUBMITTED TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY OF THEM. AND THAT AFFECTS ABOUT COUNTY. DESPITE CENTER VERY IMPORTANT AND CRITICAL BUT I DO WANT TO MAKE A POINT THAT IT'S NOT THAT EVERY PROVIDE ON EVERY MEMBER IS. IT THE- ACCESS THE STANDARDS I MEAN ONLY ONLY DO REALLY REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT AS FAR AS AN ALTERNATE ACCESS. THERE IS A TABLE TO HEAR THAT HAS ME UP WHICH MY PLAN SO I WANTED TO KIND OF UNDERSCORE THAT INYO COUNTY FOR US IS ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING COUNTY. SO I KNOW THAT WERE WHAT KIND OF. PARENT EIGHTEEN COUNTIES. COMPARED TO ALL THE. YOU WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE COUNTY IS VERY UNIQUE AND DIFFERENT. AND IF WE DO TAKE OUT INYO COUNTY FROM THE NUMBERS ARE AVERAGE ACCESS REQUEST IS ABOUT FORTY FIVE MILES. AND A MAXIMUM ACCESS MILEAGE IS NINETY NINE ALSO IN YOUR COUNTY HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR US AND WE'D BE. HAPPY TO PARTNER WITH I'M- WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND OTHER PLANS TO MAKE SURE WE ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF IN YOUR COUNTY THAT IS ONE THAT'S THAT STANDS OUT BUT THAT THE TROUBLE WITH THE- THE TABLE THAT IT IT'S BY SPECIALTY SO. ONE CAN ONLY A FIVE. MOTOR VESSEL TEASE. THEM BY READING IT YOU MIGHT SAY THAT EVERY YOU KNOW EVERY QUE. CHALLENGES WERE WON A MEMBER EIGHTEEN COUNTY SO IT IS NOT. NECESSARILY THAT SB MILEAGE AFFECTS EVERY COUNTY. I DO WANT TO GET THAT EVEN THOUGH THE MODELS IMPORTANT WE DO WANT TO STRESS YOU KNOW PHYSICIAN RECRUITMENT IN THE FACT THAT THE PHYSICIANS ARE THE PHYSICIANS IN THESE COUNTIES AND SO. LOOKING AT OTHER OPTIONS. AND THAT THE A CS HAS DONE A LOT ON PHYSICIAN RECRUITMENT AND LOAN REPAYMENT. BUT MAKING SURE WE ADDRESS THE OTHER NEEDS OF THESE COUNTIES. THAT REGARDLESS OF THE MODEL THE PHYSICIAN ACCESS IS STILL AN ISSUE ACROSS ACROSS THESE EIGHTEEN COUNTIES. INCLUDING I WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW ANTHONY COMMITTED TO THESE COUNTIES WE WORKED HARD WITH LISTEN TO COUNT. WE MEET QUARTERLY WITH EVERY COUNTY. EVERY ONE OF THE EIGHTEEN COUNTIES WHETHER IT'S PUBLIC HEALTH WE HAVE A HOUSE. WE'VE HEARD AND CUT REVISED OUR APPROACH AND IMPROVED OUR- PARTNERSHIP WITH THE I'M SO WE LOOK FORWARD. TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU MISTER. THE STORK SO GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE MY NAME IS ABBY TOTTENHAM THE MEDIC HELP PROGRAM OFFICER FOR THE COMBINED HEALTH NET IN CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND THIS MEDIC HEALTH PROGRAM IN ESSENCE THAT MEANS I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR PROGRAM ACROSS TWO MILLION MEMBERS IN A VERY UNIQUE AND DIVERSE SET OF GEOGRAPHIES I'M HERE TODAY SPECIFICALLY TO SPEAK TO OUR PERFORMANCE IN RURAL NORTHERN COUNTIES. CALIFORNIA HEALTH WELLNESS I CAME TO BE THIRTEEN ONLY KNOCKS KEEN LIFE HEALTH AND REALLY WHAT THAT MEANT AS WE AT THE BASE FOR FIREMAN'S ACCORDING TO STATE LAW BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE STOPPED SINCE THE INCEPTION OF PLAN WE'VE INCLUDED HAND. NETWORK ALMOST FOURTH HOUSE IN NEW QUIRK. TODAY OVER THREE THOUGHT SINCE SHE WAS NETWORK WITH IN THE WRONG NORTHERN SERVICE AREA AS WELL AS AN- TWELVE THOUSAND SPECIALISTS. THAT ARE- IN THE SURROUNDING GEOGRAPHIES BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT ACCESS IS LIMITED WITH IN THE RURAL NORTH WE REALLY HAVE TO LOOK OUTSIDE OF THOSE COUNTIES TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE ROBUST SPECIALTY ACCESS TO CARE. NOW THE MERGER BETWEEN OFF THAT IN CALIFORNIA HEALTH ANALYSTS GAVE US A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY AS A HEALTH PLAN TO LEVERAGE HEALTH NET STATEWIDE PRESS AND EXPAND ACCESS. A REALLY KEY EXAMPLE IS OUR- BACKROOM COUNTY WITH USE DAVIS A WE WERE ABLE THROUGH HEALTH THAT. NOT ONLY EXPAND ACCESS FOR SACRAMENTO MEMBERSHIP TO UC DAVIS IS BOTH THE PRIMARY AND SPECIALTY CARE PROVIDER. WE ARE ALSO TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A DIRECT REFERRAL PATHWAY FOR ALL OF OUR MEMBERS WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND WELLNESS SERVICE AREA. IN REALITY PROVIDER RECRUITMENT CAN TAKE MANY FORMS IT'S NOT JUST THROUGH OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH HEALTH NET IT'S A CONTINUE AN ON GOING PROCESS- WE ACTUALLY DO NOT USE NICKEL BOARD DATA WE'VE FOUND THAT THE MEDICAL BOARD IT IS NOT ACCURATE IT DOES NOT. REFLECT PROVIDER ACTUALLY AVAILABLE FOR HEALTH AND CONTRACTING IT'S LICENSED IN. EXAMPLE A KAISER IN SERVICE AREA THAT MEANS THOSE POSITIONS INCLUDED IN THE MEDICAL BOARD DATA. INSTEAD WE USE A VARIETY OF OTHER SOURCES INCLUDING PROVIDER DIRECTORIES GOOGLE SEARCHES SUGGESTIONS FROM DH CS- WE ALSO HAVE A SIDE VENDOR WE USE THAT DOES LARGE SCALE ANALYSTS TO IDENTIFY PROVIDERS THAT ARE AVAILABLE POTENTIALLY FOR CONTRACTING. WE WILL CONTRACT WITH ANY PROVIDER THAT MEETS THE STATE'S CREDENTIALING STANDARDS AND HAS A HIGH ENOUGH QUALITY OF CARE AS WELL AS MEETING- OUR CONTRACT WHERE MEN'S GENERALLY. ABOUT THE CONTRACTED RATE REALLY IN THE ROLE SERVICE IS ABOUT CAPACITY WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE SMALL NUMBER OF SPECIALISTS IN PARTICULAR IN THOSE SERVICE AREAS AND THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE ALL LINES OF BUSINESS TO SERVE. LARGELY WHEN THEY SAY THEY WANT A CONTRACT IT'S BECAUSE ALREADY INDICATED WITH MORE REQUESTS THAN THEY ARE ABLE TO SERVE. AND AS A RESULT IF THEY DON'T WANT TO CONTRACT AND OPEN TO ALL MEMBERS AND OPEN IN OUR PROVIDE DIRECT. THEY WORK WITH US AND SINGLE CASE AGREEMENT AND SINGLE CRAZE AGREEMENTS ESSENTIALLY MEANS THAT MEMBERS RECEIVE ACT TO THAT PROVIDE EVEN THEY'RE NOT. OUR PROVIDE DIRECT. LOOK TO THE OLD ACT STANDARDS. NOTED THAT- IN MANY CASES ALTERNATE ACCESS STANDS THAT ARE PROVIDED ARE REPRESENTATIVE NOT OF A SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL NEED OF ACCESS TO CARE BUT RATHER ARE OF A POTENTIAL ACCESS ISSUE FOR EXAMPLE IN INYO COUNTY IN THE CODE FOR NINE THREE FIVE TWO SEVEN WHERE WE HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARD FOR A PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGIST. IN REALITY THERE ARE NO CHILDREN WITHIN THAT ZIP CODE WE CURRENT IS ONLY ONE ADULT BUT WERE FIRED BY STATE LAW TO HAVE THE ALTERNATE ACCESS STANDARD IN ORDER TO PROVIDE. POTENTIAL SO JUST EXT. WHAT ARE SOME SAID AS WELL AS IT ISN'T JUST WATER NETWORK DIRECTORY SAYS BUT THE ADDITIONAL SERVICES THAT WE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE ONE STOP CLINICS WHERE WE BRING IN SUSAN G. KOMEN FOR MAMMOGRAPHY WE HAVE A PROGRAM FOR IN HOME SERVICES FOR OUR HIGHEST RISK MEMBERS WE REMEMBER CONNECTIONS PRO GOES TO THE HOME TO ENSURE THE- RECEIVING IT ON VISITS AT THIS TO CARE NOR HAVE. DISH ON THE ON A WIDE ARRAY OF OTHER SERVICES WE PROVIDE. THANK YOU MISTER MC. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS AMY TURNIP SEED AND THE SENIOR DIRECTOR OF EXTERNAL AND REGULATORY AFFAIRS AT PARTNERSHIP HEALTH PLAN. PARTNERSHIP IS A COUNTY AS HEALTH SYSTEM OR CODES IN SHORT WHICH MEANS MAJORITY OF MEMBERS AND ROLLED A MEDIC CAL ARE SIGNED A PARTNERSHIP AS WE ARE THE SINGLE MEDI CAL PLANT IN OUR COUNTIES. CURRENTLY PARTNERSHIP SERVES FOURTEEN COUNTIES WHICH INCLUDES FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND MEMBERS. TODAY I'M GOING TO BRIEFLY DISCUSS PARTNERSHIPS EXPERIENCE WITH THE ROLE EXPANSION WHAT MAKES THE CODES MODEL UNIQUE AND THEN SHARE SOME OF THE SPECIFIC WORK PARTNERSHIP IS DOING TO INCREASE ACCESS AND QUALITY. INCLUDED ARE PROVIDE A RECRUITMENT PROGRAM. TRANSCRIPTION HELLO HOW WHEN THE STATE AUTHORIZED THE ROLE OF IN TWENTY TWELVE A SUBSET OF THESE COUNTIES WORKED WITH THEIR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND LOCAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS TO LOBBY THE STATE AND PARTNERSHIP TO JOIN THE CODES MODEL IN ADDITION MANY OF THESE COUNTY SET UP MEETINGS WITH OUR PLANS LEADERSHIP TEAM TO DISCUSS THE- FEASIBILITY. OF JOINT PARTNERSHIP HEALTH PLAN. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN PARTNERSHIP. YES CAME TO A MUTUAL AGREEMENT ON THE EIGHT COUNTY SELECTED TO JOIN THE CODES MODEL AS PART OF FOR EXPANSION. WHAT MAKES THE COAST MODEL UNIQUE THE CODES ARE COMMUNITY BASED NOT FOR PROFIT MISSION DRIVEN HEALTH PLAN THAT EMPHASIZES TRANSPARENCY. WE HAVE A STRONG FOUNDATION AND THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE MAINTAIN STRONG TIES TO LOCAL PROVIDERS AND OUR MEMBERS. BEING THE SINGLE MEDI CAL PLAN IN OUR COUNTIES ALLOWS US THE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO BE CLOSELY CONNECTED TO OUR SAFETY NET PROVIDERS. PARTNERSHIP IS GOVERNED BY A THIRTY TWO MEMBER BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS THAT INCLUDE AT LEAST ONE PRESENTED IT FROM EACH COUNTY DOMINATED BY THE- SUPERVISORS AS WELL AS TO. PARTNERSHIPS MISSION IS TO REMEMBER AND THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. WE LIVE OUR MISSION THROUGH OUR STRONG COMMITMENT TO IMPROVING QUALITY AND ACCESS FOR OUR MEMBERS. OUR MISSION CAN BE SEEN IN A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS BUT IT'S LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THREE. THE FIRST BEING PROVIDER RECRUITMENT. WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF CONTRACTING WITH EVERY WILLING AND ABLE PROVIDER AND OUR SERVICE AND SURROUNDING AREAS. AS THE ONLY MEDI CAL PLAN IN OUR COUNTIES WE BELIEVE THIS IS ADVANTAGEOUS IN THE CONTRACTING PROCESS. HOWEVER HAVING A PER ACT ADAM BUT PROVIDER NETWORK ESPECIALLY IN OUR WORLD. CONNECT ON THESE IS NOT WITHOUT ITS CHALLENGES. IN MANY OF OUR IS IT. THE ISSUE IS NOT CONTRACTING WITH THE PROVIDERS IT IS AT THAT PROVIDERS IN THE AREA. THE SHIP IS DEDICATED OF MILLION FIRST PROVIDER. AND SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO RECRUIT THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR PROVIDERS FOR FOURTEEN COUNTIES. SECOND TRANSPORTATION WE DO OUR BEST TO ENSURE OUR MEMBERS HAVE ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE INCLUDING PROVIDING TRANSPORTATION ARE NON MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION BENEFITS HAVE INCREASED OVER 3100% SINCE INCEPTION IN JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTEEN. WE STILL NOT SEEN AND EXPERIENCED A BALLOT SCENE OF UTILIZATION AND MEMBERS CONTINUE TO SEEK TRANSPORTATION TO THE VISITS. THIRD TELEHEALTH THERE SHOULD BE ACTIVELY WORKING ON WAYS TO EXPAND TELEHEALTH SERVICES TO OUR MEMBERS AND OUR PROVIDER NETWORK ARE TELEHEALTH PROGRAM CURRENTLY LIVES IN TWENTY TWO LOCATIONS HAS COMPLETED OVER THIRTEEN THOUSAND VIDEO CONSULTATIONS AND NEARLY TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED ECON. OUR TOP THREE TELEHEALTH SPECIALTIES. ALLERGY RHEUMATOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY. IN CONCLUSION WE APPRECIATE THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT IN SUPPORTING THE CLOTHES MODEL AND IT KNOWLEDGE IN OUR COMMITMENT TO IMPROVING QUALITY IN ACTS FOR OUR MEMBERS FOR PARTNERSHIP THE CAUSE MODEL IS THE PREFERRED. H. CARE MODEL SENATOR PAN SENATOR RUBIO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU. DOCTOR MILLER. GOOD MORNING THANKS FOR HAVING ME TODAY MY NAME IS ANDY MILLER AND THE BIãU COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER. AND I SIT HERE TODAY AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE GROUP OF COUNTIES. WHO WORK TOGETHER HOPING TO HAVE A VOICE IN THE WAY THAT- MEDIC MEDIC COW WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN THEIR JURISDICTIONS. THE PROPERTY HOPE OF COUNTIES. IS TO WORK WITH THE H. C. S. TO MOVE TO A COUNTY ORGANIZED HEALTH- SYSTEM OR KOS MODEL. CURRENTLY THE GREAT MAJORITY IF NOT ALL OF THE EIGHTEEN COUNTIES INCLUDING THE CLINICS HOSPITALS. OF PERMITS BEHAVIOR DEPARTMENTS OF THESE CHARACTERS DESIRE EXPLORING THIS MOVE. WE'VE BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS AMONG OURSELVES AND WITH DH CS FOR ALMOST THREE YEARS NOW. SO WHY DO WE WANT THIS CHANGE A IT'S NOT A SURPRISE TO YOU ALL THAT RURAL COUNTIES HAVE AMONG THE POOREST HEALTH INDICATORS. I SOME OF THESE ARE PROBLEMS OF GEOGRAPHY AND OF WORK FORCE THAT ARE DIFFICULT CHALLENGES FOR ANY MEDI CAL MODEL. GET THESE CHALLENGES SHOULD REALLY BE AN EXCUSE TO ACCEPT THEY SUGGEST THE NEED FOR A MODEL THAT MAXIMIZES ACCESS AND QUALITY. AND ACCORDING TO THE AUDIT AND TO SOME CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION DOCUMENTS OVER THE YEARS. OF THE REGIONAL MODELS HAVE NOT RECEIVED THIS ACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF CARE. WE SEE MANY POTENTIAL BENEFITS FOR A KOS- AND LET ME COVER A COUPLE. BECAUSE GOVERNOR. I INCLUDES LOCAL ENTITIES. THEY HAVE A PLACE ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND ENSURE THE LOCAL PRIORITIES ARE OUR ADDRESS. DOES HAVE A HISTORY WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH WILL. TO ADDRESS IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH AND GENERAL HEALTH CONCERN LIKE OPIOIDS EXPANDING- DRUG MEDI CAL ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS THROUGH THE WHOLE PERSON CARE AND TARGETING CHRONIC DISEASES THROUGH HEALTH HARMS. CLOSE SHOULD HAVE SHOWN INCREASED POTENTIAL TO CREATE A BROADER PHYSICIAN NETWORK AND RURAL COUNTIES AS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND AS THE AUDIT SUPPORTS. UN KOS HAVE A SATISFACTION AMONG KEY STAKE HOLDERS INCLUDING HOSPITALS CLINICS HEALTH DEPARTMENTS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS FOR EXAMPLE THE EIGHT COUNTIES THE JOINT PARTNERSHIP IN TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN ALL OF THEM ARE SET BY THE WITH KOS INNER HERE- TALKING ABOUT THAT. AND YET THE GREAT MAJORITY OF NOT ALL COUNTIES IN THE REGIONAL MODEL HAVE TOGETHER WITH THIS CONCERN. BUT A CLOSE MAY HAVE A GREATER OF RESOURCES TO DEDICATE TO LOCAL PRIORITIES NO PORTION OF THAT CAPITATION IS PAID TO SHAREHOLDERS AND HENCE IS AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS PRIORITIES SUCH AS PROVIDE A RECRUITMENT WHICH WE JUST HEARD ABOUT. SO FOR FROM OUR STANDPOINT THE DESIRED. OUTCOMES WOULD BE pTHE H. C. S. R. TO PUT IN PLACE A TRANSPARENT PROCESS COUNTIES TO EITHER MOVE. TO AN EXISTING GOES TO IMPLEMENT A CUP. THE OTHER OUT THANK IS WHICH IN THE OF UPCOMING R. F. THAT WOULD ALLOW REGIONAL MODEL COUNTIES TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT ECHOES OR JOIN AN EXISTING BECAUSE IN THEIR COUNTY BY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE. IN ORDER TO OP. SS THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS AT. JIM WOOD. YEAH ALL RIGHT- SO- I UNDERSTAND FROM- THE PRESENTATION FROM ANTHEM THAT- DE SICKLY ONE OF THINGS THAT YOU DO IS YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO I GUESS YOU HAVE EXISTING CONTRACTS WITHIN YOUR ASSN AND UP FOR THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM I DON'T KNOW I WAS FOR CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND WELLNESS BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE JUST. REALLY JUST THE MEDI CAL PLAN. WELL YOU HAVE HEALTH THAT TOO RIGHT SO WITH THAT YEAH WITH THEM WE HAVE BOTH THAT CALIFORNIA'S MOST AND HEALTH NET AND WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WERE ACTUALLY LEVERAGING THE HEALTH THAT CONTRACTS WITH SO. OKAY SO I GUESS THIS IS YOUNGER. OKAY WELL KELLY DAY QUESTION THEN IS WHAT DO YOU DO BEYOND. THE PEOPLE YOU HAVE YOUR COMMERCIAL CONTRACT. TO REACH OUT TO PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT HAVE A COMMERCIAL CONTRACT WITH YOU. ASKED THEM TO CONTRACT ON THE MEDI CAL AND- YOU MADE MENTION OF LIKE 2100% OF MEDI CAL RATES WELL THAT'S STILL NOT VERY HIGH. HOW ARE YOU WILLING TO GO IN ORDER TO SURE THAT SOMEONE CONTRACT SO YES I AGREE. THEN THERE ARE A LOT OF PHYSICIANS. THEY MAY BE A LITTLE TAPPED OUT ARE MAXED OUT BUT ALSO FRANKLY WHEN THEY LOOK AT THE LIST THEY'RE LOOKING AT. PLANS THAT THEY CAN. THAT THEY CAN BE RELIABLY NOW THE PLAYED RIGHT RATE BUT THEY CAN BE RELIABLY PAID- BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU'LL GET PAID ON TIME- THAT THEY DON'T OCCUR INCREASED COSTS FOR HAVING A CONTRACT WITH THEM BECAUSE THEY PUT IT THROUGH THE WRINGER- TERMS. GET ANY FUNDING L. A REIMBURSEMENT SO THE THING. APPROACH THAT DOES PROVIDE THOSE PHYSICIANS AND OTHER PROVIDERS TO SHOW THAT DAY YOU THAT THIS IS A SUPERIOR PLANNED THE CONTRACT WITH THEY MAY NOT HAVE AN EXISTING COMMERCIAL PLANNED BUT THAT YOU WILL ACTUALLY DELIVER FOR THEM TO MAKE IT WORTH YOUR WHILE TO ACTUALLY. CONTRACT KLAY SPECIALISTS. NOTHING SO WE DO THANK YOU KNOW WE GO ALL THE WAY UP TO EVEN COMMERCIAL RATES AND MEDICARE RATES SO. THE REASON I'M SET THAT EXAMPLE. THERE'S NEVER BEEN AN TIME WITH THAT I WAS AWARE OF THAT WE HAVE NOT CONTRACT WITH A PROVIDER BECAUSE OUR RATES BUT YOUR QUESTION ADDITIONAL TO RATES. IN ANYTIME WE HAVE A AS ABBY MENTION A SINGLE CASE AGREEMENT. OR AGREEMENTS THAT COMES AND WHERE WE SAY NUMBER NEEDED A PROVIDER THAT LOCAL. ENGAGE THAT PROVIDER AND SAY WE WOULD LIKE TO BRING YOU A WIDE NETWORK LET'S LET'S START DISCUSSING- THAT POSSIBILITY BUT- I WOULD I WOULD THINK AGAIN UNDERSCORE THAT A LOT THOSE FACTORS. ARE CAPACITY THERE EITHER ANALYSTS. COMMERCIAL BEARS- THE THERE'S A LOT OF WORK WITH MEDICAID. A LOT OF ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS WHETHER IT'S YOUR HEATER SCORES WEATHER'S DOCUMENTATION FACILITY CITED THE AND HE TO SUPPLIES I MEAN HE IS NOT SPECIFIC MEDICAL CORRECT. THE IT'S NOT SYMPTOMATIC SHOP AT THE MEDICAL PROVIDER IS BEING HELD TO A SPECIFIC HE TO SCORES THAT ARE NOT THE SAME AS COMMERCIAL PROVIDERS. SO THERE ARE IS A LOT MORE OVERSIGHT AND FRANKLY. WE WILL PUT THE ITEMS ON FOR THAT HE MATCH. CATION THAT'S WHAT PROVIDERS SO DEFINITELY AS A MEDICAL PROVIDER YOU ARE EXPERIENCING AT THE- OVERSIGHT- RIGHTFULLY SO FAR MEMBERS BUT IT IS IT IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN A COMMERCIAL PROVIDER EXPERIENCES AND THE SAME. IN THE SAME COMMUNITY SO A LOT OF TIMES THEY'LL THAT. IT TAKE FIVE TOP PROVIDERS FIVE FIVE MEDI CAL MEMBERS. TEN THEY STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH A FACILITY SITE REVIEW SOME ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS. THAT IF THEY WERE JUST TO TAKE A TOLL WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE NON AMASSING THAT'S THE MAIN REASON OR THE ONLY REASON. BY THAT IS A PART OF THE REALITY OF. THIS. CAL BUT I WOULD JUST ADD WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT A PARTICULAR ON SPECIALTY PRACTICES THERE ARE WAYS TO LOOK AT CREATIVE CONTRACTING OPPORTUNITIES WHERE DIRECT FEE FOR SERVICE CONTRACT PER SE BUT WHERE WE CAN FOR EXAMPLE LEASE A PERIOD OF TIME WITHIN THEIR OFFICE TO USE AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY I'M GONNA PUT YOU IN MY DIRECTORY BUT IT ALLOWS FOR. OUR MEMBERS. SO SIR. HOW WE WORK WITH SOME OF OUR PROVIDER AND YOUR INCENTIVE BASED CONTRACTING IF YOU'RE ABLE TO HIT CERTAIN HE DOES METRICS YOU GET ADDITIONAL BONUSES WHICH THEN MAKES PROVIDERS MORE WILLING TO SEE THE MEMBERS- WE ALSO LOOKED AT AND WITH SOME OF OUR HOSPITAL PARTNERS. ACTUALLY PUTTING WITHIN THE CONSTRUCT OF THEIR CONTRACTS RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION BONUSES SO THAT NOT ONLY ARE THEY AS A HOSPITAL SYSTEM ALREADY PLANNING TO RECRUIT FOR SOME OF THESE PROVIDERS BUT WE'RE ADDING SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING. TO MAKE IT A SUSTAINABLE PRACTICE MODEL FOR THEM AND THAT'S HELP TO WELL WE DON'T HAVE NECESSARILY A FUN BUT IS CIVIC FOR PROVIDER RECRUITMENT WE DO PROVIDE FUNDING TO SOME OF OUR HOSPITAL. IS BECAUSE THEY ARE THE LARGEST SPECIALTY CARE WITHIN THE RURAL AREAS. I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE- THAT- THAT WE'RE DOING THE LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM- WE TALK ABOUT NOT ENOUGH. MEDI CAL PROVIDERS- THAT PROGRAMS OVERSUBSCRIBED. CORRECT. YES WE CERTAINLY HAD MORE APPLICANTS THAN WE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO FUND AND QUITE HONESTLY WE EXPECT FOR THIS NEXT ROUND FOR THAT TO GRANT SO FOR SURE. YEAH SO I WOULD. HYPOTHESIZE THAT IF GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY THE SUFFICIENT PAYMENT THEY'LL MAKE IT SUSTAINABLE UNPAYABLE. THAT YOU WILL GET THE PROVIDERS BECAUSE THERE WILL EAT SO OVERSUBSCRIBED PEOPLE OR ELSE EVEN IF WE STEP UP AND PROVIDE THEM WITH WHAT THEY NEED TO MAKE A LIVING. AND THEY WILL COME. YOU DISAGREE. OKAY ALL RIGHT SO THAT'S ALL WE NEED TO DO CORRECT. OKAY SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN WORK THIS OUT AND GET SUFFICIENT RATES AND THEN YOU'LL FIND ENOUGH PROVIDERS TO CARE FOR PATIENTS CORRECT. OKAY THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT NOW- EIGHT YOU KNOW I THINK- KOS IS A PARTICULAR MODEL AND DAY APPRECIATE AS MANY UP PERHAPS. DOCTOR MILLER- I KNOW THAT YOU'RE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CONSORTIUM- ASIDE FROM YOU KNOW YOU TALK MORE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT ECHOES WHAT ARE THE CHARACTERISTICS. THAT CLOSER OTHERWISE BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THIS WILL GO WHAT KIND OF THINGS DO YOU LIKE YOU HEARD ME ASK THE QUESTION OF THE EIGHTY S. BEFORE WHAT KIND OF THINGS THAT. THE COUNTY IS ONE IS FROM THE STATE IN REGARDS TO HELP WITH THAT A CAL AND HELPING COUNTIES PROVIDE BETTER. ACCESS TO PEOPLE IN COUNTY WHETHER IT'S A COULD BE A CAUSE BUT IT COULD ALSO BE L. IT. THE WHAT THE REGIONAL MODEL LIKE WHAT. WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE SOME THE THINGS THAT YOU SEE- DEFICIENCIES THAT WE NEED TO STEP UP AND DOING YEAH SO. I AM I'M TEMPTED TO TRY TO ANSWER THE QUESTION IT FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH STANDPOINT BUT I THINK THAT REALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT WE DID WHEN WE STARTED LOOKING AT THIS AS A COUNTY. AND I THINK OTHER COUNTIES HAVE DONE WAS TO TALK TO OUR HEALTH CARE PARTNERS THE PEOPLE THAT DELIVER THE CARE. AND THAT ARE REALLY THE CORE IN THE IMPORTANT PART OF THIS INFRASTRUCTURE. AND WE DO WE WANT TO AND SAID HEY YOU KNOW THIS CONTRACT BE UP IN THE NEAR FUTURE- WHY DON'T YOU. LOOK AT WHAT WHAT YOU GET IN AND WHAT YOU WHAT YOU DO. THINK ABOUT THE PROGRAM THAT YOU'RE IN TOCHTER ASSOCIATIONS TALK TO YOUR- COLLEAGUES IN NEARBY COUNTIES- MANY OF THEM ACTUALLY RAN. OPERATIONS IN MULTIPLE COUNTY SINCE A WORKED UNDER BILL MODELS. AND SO- I THINK. THAT THAT'S IT'S NOT AS MUCH. OKAY SO I'M START. AND I THINK ALL THE THINGS THAT LIKELY YOU HAVE HEARD. IT'S ABOUT- BEING ABLE TO CONTRACT. THE RATES OF CONTRACTING GETTING PAID- HOW DIFFICULT ALL THOSE THINGS ARE. HI SO IT'S KIND OF THE CORE BUSINESS OF YOU KNOW WHAT DH CS DOES AND WHAT THESE PROVIDERS PROVIDE. NO MORE SPECIFICALLY IF YOU START TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH AND BEHAVIOR HEALTH. WE GET INTO LOTS OF AREAS SPECIFIC AREAS- YOU KNOW THEIR INTERACT WITH SIDE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S SERVICES THEIR INTERACTION WITH ADULTS HI. DAY CARE CENTERS- THEIR INTERACTION WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. AND AGAIN COMING BACK TO- TO PROVIDE A FOR PROVIDER PANELS. BUT IT IT'S THOSE CONVERSATIONS THAT HAVE LED TO THE- VERSION I DESCRIBED AND NOT JUST OP COUNTY IN MULTIPLE CAT. YEAH JUST. GIVE MULLIN SAID YOU KNOW WHAT IS IT WHAT YOUR CONCERNS. HELLO AND WE WENT THROUGH WITH THE DH CS STAFF THE BOILER PLATE CONTRACTORS AS A WE HAVE A PROPERLY DON'T THE ACTUAL CONTRACTS AND SO WE WENT THROUGH WE THESE AREN'T SO BAD IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF LIVING UP TO THEM. THAT'S DIFFICULT SO I THINK THAT THE COPS THEMSELVES WHAT WE WANT FROM THE STATE I THINK THERE'S A LOT THAT'S IN THERE IT'S JUST BEEN HARD TO ACTUALLY. LIVE UP TO THOSE. SO BASED ON YOUR TESTIMONY AND I REALIZE THAT YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE THE ACTUAL CONTRACT BUT- IF IT JUST COULDACTUALLY ENFORCE THE STANDARDS IN THE CONTRACT THAT YOU THE BOILER PLATE CONTACT YOU RECEIVE THAT THINGS WOULD BE MUCH BETTER WELL I MEAN IT I THINK THE YES AND I THINK THAT ONE OF IS THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT THE- THE ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARDS I THINK THAT IT'S REASONABLE AND I'VE IN THE RESPONSE DH CS PROTECTION AGAINST UNREASONABLY HIGH RATES ANYTHING THAT NEEDS TO BE THERE BUT I DON'T SEE ANYTHING IN THERE THAT TALKS ABOUT STANDARDS PROTECTING. THEY THE BENEFICIARIES FROM UNREASONABLY LOW RATES I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS I DON'T SEE THAT BUT I DON'T SEE THAT IN THE DISCUSSION AT ANY POINT- IN RESPONSE AND SO I THINK THAT TOO THAT'S WHY WE ARE THE ONLY WAY TO CATCH ARE THESE TIME SINCE HER MAN. SO YOU HAVE TO BE. REALLY CAUTIOUS AND CAREFUL. HOW WE ARE HOLDEN TO THOSE STANDARDS WERE NOT WHEN THOSE EXCEPTIONS ARE MADE. WELL COMMENTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT TO PUT OUT ABOUT THIS SURE SO WHETHER AND IF WE WEREN'T CLEAR CERTAINLY IF WE WERE SEEING UNREASONABLE LIKE YOU KNOW NOT THAT I THINK THE FOLKS AT MY TABLE WOULD BE LIKE YOU'LL BE PAID TWO DOLLARS OR SOMETHING- IT IS THAT BALANCE OF IS IT REASONABLE COMPARED TO WHAT IT EITHER CAL PACE TODAY WHETHER THAT SUFFICIENT OR NOT OBVIOUSLY A CONVERSATION. WHAT IS AND AGAIN WHEN YOU HAVE TWO PLANS WHAT IT PLAN PAYING WHY IS THAT WORKING HOW DO WE LOOK AT STANDARDS LIKE. YOU KNOW COMPONENTS OF MEDICARE OR I THINK REALLY AND I THINK THIS IS THE WORK THAT OUR PLANS HAVE BEEN DOING THAT WE ARE ENCOURAGING MOVING AWAY FROM THIS CONSTRUCT OF SORT OF PAYMENT FOR SPECIFIC SERVICES BUT HOW DO WE- SERVE. AND ALL THAT IN A WAY IT HAVE THESE SENT ARRANGEMENTS AS WELL. AS NOT JUST A SERVICE WAS PROVIDED WHICH IS IMPORTANT BUT IF IT'S NOT A SERVICE THAT'S ACTUALLY SIR THE PERSON OR ADDRESSING ALL OF YOUR NEEDS. AND THE OUTCOMES ARE GETTING BETTER HOW TO COME THOSE IS TO USE IT TO MAKE SURE. MEMBERS PROVIDE. COMPANY ALL OF AND THAT'S REALLY. WORK HAVE BEEN DOING OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE THE ELEMENTS THAT WE'VE BEEN PUTTING IN WITH RESPECT TO PROP FIFTY SIX. AND THEN AGAIN REALLY I WAITED TO HEARKEN BACK TO. A LOT OF THE ISSUES AND SUGGESTIONS YOU SEEN OUR CALLIN PROPOSAL AS WAYS EVEN FURTHER DRIVE. AND REALLY REALLY HAVE THAT REAL OPPORTUNITY A AND SUBJECT BUDGETARY CONVERSATIONS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. BUT WHERE COULDN'T. OR IS THE BEST WAY FOR US TO INVEST MONEY. THAT REALLY DRIVES THOSE CHANGES IN OUTCOMES IMPROVEMENTS IN NOT JUST THE QUALITY OF THEIR PARTICULAR HEALTH SERVICES BUT THEIR OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE AND THAT. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FOCUS AYE AND I THINK OUR PLAN THERE'S ARE ARE VERY SORT OF ON BOARD WITH THAT SUPPORTIVE OF THAT. WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT SO IT IT IS ALSO. SOME LOOKED TOTALLY UNREASONABLY SO THAT WE WOULD REJECT AN ALTERNATIVE ACCESS REQUIRE. LESS BUT WE ALSO DO YOU HAVE. TO YOU KNOW AS FISCAL AGENTS OF STATE. WHAT I MEAN SO IT'S NOT A BALANCE OF BOTH MAKING SURE IT'S NOT. TOO LOW BUT ALSO RECOGNIZING WHAT IS REASONABLE FROM A MORE TALKING ABOUT I THINK IN THE COMP I THINK THAT COMES BACK TO A PREVIOUS KIND PATIENT ABOUT WHAT ARE THE STANDARDS YEAH AND THE AND THAT'S FAIR AND THEN. WHAT WE SHOULD DEFINITELY HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE. THE REFERENCE IS MADE TO TABLE THREE AND THE HE THIS PERFORMANCE. AND I WON'T. I'M NOT GONNA GO BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT PLANS BUT HOW. SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE HERE NUMBER MEASURES TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY TO THE TERROR OF THE HOUSE AND THEN WE HAVE THE NUMBER OF AVERAGE NUMBER IF YOU JUST MEASURES BELOW MINIMUM PERFORMANCE LEVEL SO THESE ARE ALL BELOW MINIMUM PERFORMANCE LEVELS. AND SO GOOD THING IS THAT TWENTY EIGHTEENS LOOKS BETTER IN THE PRIOR YEARS. HOW THIS COMMERCIALLY COMPARED TO A TYPICAL COMMERCIAL PLAN. SO IS THIS IS IT THE NUMBER OF THE LOW PERFORMANCE LEVELS THIS TYPICAL FOR THAT COMMERCIAL PLAN WILL NORMALLY HAVE THIS MANY BLOW PERFORMANCE LEVELS IS WE'RE SEEING I'M NOT GONNA PICK ON ANY PARTICULAR PLAN HERE BUT WE CAN SEE THEIR- HOUSES. YEAH WITH THAT I THINK I MEAN I USED TO COME FROM THE COMMERCIAL SIDE A FEW YEARS SO I DEFINITELY THINK THE PATIENT POPULATION IS VERY DIFFERENT. THAT'S NOT MY QUESTION I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT IS SO IS THIS IS THIS ACCEPTABLE WARS THE SERVICE NATIONALLY AND PROVIDED THIS AND SAID WE WERE BELOW OF THIS MANY LEVELS WITH THAT THE- IS THAT TYPICAL. IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE I CAN TELL YOU COMMITTED TO. THE SCORES OF THE S. S. AS A LOT TO A PARTNER YES. ON ON IMPROVE WE'VE WE'VE ACTUALLY. FOR MOST IMPROVED AWARD IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS IT IS A LOT OF MEASURES IT'S AT A LOT OF- EXCHANGE OF DATA. AS WELL AS ACCESO HE THIS IS VERY COMPLEX AND I WE HAVE A I DON'T BELIEVE ME I. DEFINITELY NOT WHAT WE WANT TO BE I THINK ARE. COMMITTED TO THAT WHETHER IT'S FOR THE PHYSICIAN AND SENATE'S WHETHER IT'S DATA SUPPORT WHETHER IT'S- NURSES IN THE OFFICES OF PROVIDERS WHICH HAVE. WHETHER IT'S GOING TO MEMBERS HOMES THERE'S A DIFFERENT WAYS TO IMPROVE YOUR SCORES QUE- BUT I THINK WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ZERO BELOW A THE REQUIREMENTS AS WELL. HELLO WELL I WE JUST MAKE NOTES I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT. HE'D S. WHICH IS BASED ON MINISTRY OF DATA ALSO. TENDS TO FOCUS ON ITEMS THAT HAVE LARGER PATIENT BASIS BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU WON'T HAVE ENOUGH NUMBERS SO. WELL HE THIS IN ITSELF IS HELPFUL AND USEFUL- I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT HE THIS THAT BY ITSELF IS INSUFFICIENT EVEN IF THEY WERE ALL ZERO RATE THAT'S GOOD BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'VE DONE A GOOD ENOUGH JOB BECAUSE AS A PHYSICIAN WE ALSO TAKE CARE OF PATIENTS WITH RARE CONDITIONS. YOU DID MAKE NOTE THAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE SOMEONE AT CHAVEZ CHEN HEART DISEASE THEY'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A HE THE SCORE BECAUSE IT'S NOT ENOUGH SO- WE CAN'T LEAVE PEOPLE BEHIND EITHER- BUT BUT AWESOME EVEN THOUGH IT IS SCHOOLS WE COULD DO BETTER SOMETHING. I AGREE. I THINK THAT'S A RUBIO. PRETTY MUCH ASKED OTHER QUESTIONS BUT I TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT YOU MENTIONED IN PASSING. FOR A MISTER CUSS ROBBIE I HOPE I'M PRONOUNCING THE CORRECT AS WELL- YOU TALKED ABOUT- DISAGREEING WITH THE AUDIT SOME JUST LOOK HERE IS HE SAID THAT YOU WERE CURIOUS ABOUT THE NINETEEN HUNDRED PROVIDERS THAT WORK. LIKE DAD AND THAT IT DEPEND ON WHAT SPECIALTY WAS WHETHER SPECIAL TO YOU. AND THANK YOU SO ON BUT BUT ALL AGES CAN YOU SHARE WITH ME. WELL FURTHER HOW THAT SKEWS THE AUDIT FINING. I THINK I WAS MAINLY SAYING THAT WE CONTRACT WITH THIRTY SEVEN OVER THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED SPECIALIST CURRENTLY IN THE IN THE WORLD REGIONAL MODEL. THIS NINETEEN HUNDRED WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE SPECIFICS OF- YOU KNOW WHAT'S PROVIDERS THEY THEY ARE BECAUSE SOME. THAT BUT BUT BECAUSE IT'S BASED ON THE BOARD WEBSITE AND I DON'T HAVE THE DETAILS OF THAT THIS THING. BUT IT COULD BE THAT OF THEM ARE EITHER HOSPITAL BASED PHYSICIANS. JUST OTHER SPECIALISTS THAT MAYBE DON'T. EITHER A FOR AN OPEN PANEL OR THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO SEE IT MEDI CAL MEMBER SUGGEST BECAUSE THERE'S AN AND NINETEEN HUNDRED OUT THE REST AS ABBY WAS SAYING. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE POTENTIAL. IS FOR US THE CONTRACT. BUT WE WILL GET THAT LIST ENGAGE US PROVIDERS TOMORROW. BUT I JUST WANT TO CAUTION THAT THAT NINETEEN HUNDRED SEEMS A LOT- BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT ALSO IN THE COUNTY SPECIFIC DETAILS FOR EXAMPLE I LOOK. THIS MORNING AT THE BOARD WEBSITE INYO COUNTY. THERE'S FIFTEEN SPECIALIST IN IN YOUR ACCOUNT. BUT WEBSITE KNOW WHETHER THEY TAKE THEIR SHOW WHETHER THEY TAKE MEDI CAL I TRIED. IT WITH THAT THERE'S AN INTERACTIVE TOOL. THERE'S A LOT THAT'S NOT. CLEAR AND THE WEBSITE ON THE BOARD WEBSITE THAT'S WHY ATTY WITH PENSION AND WE USE OTHER TYPES OF DIRECTORIES. WE YOU KNOW WE USE THAT REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE THE LAST FIVE YEARS WHERE MEMBERS HAVE ASKED US THAT THERE'S A THERE'S A CARDIOLOGISTS NEXT DOOR I WANT TO GO TO THE CARDIOLOGISTS WE GIVE THEM A SINGLE CASE. AGREEMENT AND THEN WE ENGAGE THAT CARDIOLOGISTS TO SAY WE SEE MATT MEMBERS YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S HAD A- RIGHT AND A MAJORITY THE TIME IF NOT ALL IT'S EITHER THEIR FULL BY THE ONLY ONE I SEE COMMERCIAL AND THEY MADE IT. A UNIQUE SITUATION FOR THIS ONE MEMBER. I'M SUCH THING WE REALLY NEED TO KNOW. IN NINETEEN HUNDRED S. AND BUT THERE REALISTICALLY ABLE TO TAKE MEDI CAL MEMBERS REGARDLESS OF THE RATE LET'S PUT THE RATE AT THAT IF THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY. TO SAVING CAUGHT. AND THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF POSITIONS AND ON THIS. CAR JUST. AS WE LIKE TO WHAT. WHAT TYPE POSITION THEY ARE. FOR THAT. AUDITOR'S CAN. IS THERE ANY WAY TO LIKE INTO A TEN HAVE AN ACCURATE MEASURE OF. WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. ACTUALLY NOW WITH AUDITOR'S HERE IN THE AUDIENCE DO YOU MIND COMING UP THEN PERHAPS ADDRESSING CENTER RUBEUS QUESTIONS MAY NEED A LITTLE. I'M SORRY. OKAY. SO THE NINETEEN HUNDRED- IS IT AGAIN WE DID USE MEDICAL BOARD DATA AND OSTEOPATHIC BOARD DATA AND LOOK AT THE VARIOUS REGIONAL COUNTIES THOSE RURAL COUNTIES- SO WE DIDN'T GO IN AND SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED BY SPECIALTY OR TYPE OF POSITION POSITION BUT WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DATE IN THE REPORT WHICH I THINK WE WERE SUCCESSFUL. BASED ON WHAT. MONEY I'M HEARING IS. IDENTIFY TOOLS IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES CAN DO AN ANALYSES OF EIGHT USING DATA FROM THE MEDICAL BOARD AND THEN NOW YOU HAVE NINETEEN HUNDRED THAT POTENTIALLY IF YOU PICK UP PROVIDERS SO WHAT ARE POINT IN THE AUDIT REPORT WAS. NEEDS TO BE MORE ANALYSIS. UNTIL PROVIDERS TO TRY TO GET. I DO APPRECIATE WHAT WHAT- ANTHEM IS SUGGESTING AND HEALTH AND WELLNESS BUT IN LISTENING TO THEIR TESTIMONY THERE THEY ARE REACTING TO A BENEFICIARY SAYING I WANT TO TAKE MY CHILD TO THIS CARDIOLOGISTS THEY AREN'T NECESSARILY WORKING WITH HEALTH CARE SERVICES OR HEALTH CARE SERVICES ISN'T NECESSARILY PROACTIVELY SAYING. HAVE A CARDIOLOGISTS IN THE INYO COUNTY THAT'S NOT PART OF A MEDIC CAL LET'S REACH OUT TO THAT CARDIOLOGISTS AND SPEED ARE YOU WILLING TO PARTICIPATE SO LET'S NOT RELY ON FISCHERI TO SUGGEST I WANT TO TAKE MY CHILD IS CARDIOLOGISTS. SO I UNDERSTAND NOT ALL NINETEEN HUNDRED POTENTIALLY WILL PARTICIPATE IN MEDI CAL WILL BE WILLING TO BE PROVIDERS WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DEMONSTRATE AS THE STATE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES DOING MORE ANALYSIS. TO TRY TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS EITHER BY SPECIALTY BY LOCATION LOOK AT THOSE DIFFERENT COUNTIES AND SEE WHERE THERE ARE- GAPS IN THE NUMBER OF PROVIDERS AVAILABLE TO BENEFICIARIES AND TRY TO CLOSE THOSE GAPS USING INFORMATION LIKE. THE EMPHASIS WE DID DURING THE COURT THE AUDIT. THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION WHAT IT DOES AND THE REASON I WANTED TO FIND THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE RICH. OF PROBLEMS HERE TRYING TO BE MORE PROACTIVE IN TRYING TO ENSURE ONE HAS ACCESS AND WHEN THERE IS A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION I JUST KINDA WANT TO CLARIFY BECAUSE- IT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE POWER. ON BUT I WILL. A CHANCE TO MONTICELLO I'M HEARING THAT DOWN. YOU KNOW I'M SERVICES LIKE UP CARDIOLOGISTS BUT YOU MAY NOT BE ENGAGING THEM SO WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY TO. STATE IT SO I THINK THAT THE WHAT YOU'RE HEARING HERE IS THAT THERE IS NOTHING MORE WE CAN DO WE LOOK AT THE A CS DIRECTORY WE LOOK AT OTHER MEDICARE DIRECTORIES- WE ARE VERY PROACTIVE- WHEN WE FIRST MOVED INTO MANAGED CARE WE LOOK AT THE BY TOP PROVIDER THAT WAS FOR SERVICE BEFORE THEY WENT INTO MANAGED CARE AND REACHED OUT TO THEM FOR CONTRACTS. SO I. IN THOSE COUNTIES NOW WHETHER REALISTICALLY HEY WE HAVE HEAVY ALREADY ENGAGE THEM AND THEY SAID NO. ANY OF THIS IS A RESEARCH PART OF ME RESEARCH APARTMENT COMING OUT BUT- WHETHER WE WRITING IS AND THEY SAID NO WHETHER THEY TAKE MEDICARE I'LL- WHETHER THEY ARE IN THE SPECIALTY THAT IS IDENTIFIED IN TABLE THREE- I ACTUALLY SAVINGS TABLE TO- THOSE ARE THINGS I THINK WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO WORK ON. THAT TOGETHER PARTNERING WITH PLANS WITH THE H. YEAH. TO I DON'T KNOW IF THIS EARLY THE DIFFERENT MODELS WITH. THAT I THINK IT'S MORE ABOUT. ACROSS MAYBE CROSS REFERENCING THAT BOARD DATA WITH THE DH CS DATA WITH. DATA THAT EACH PLAN MIGHT HAVE THAT THAT'S ALREADY CONTRACTED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE EVERY AVAILABLE PROVIDER IS A GOAL FOR US. IS TO MAXIMIZE ACCESS THERE'S NOT THERE'S NOT IN OUR BEST INTEREST TO MAKE UP A MEMBER. GO FIVE HUNDRED MILES TO SEE A SPECIALIST BECAUSE AT THE END UP IN THE HOSPITAL. IT'S GOING TO BE IN THAT BAD EXPERIENCE FOR EVERYBODY SO WE WILL DO WHAT IT TAKES. AND WITH THE STATE. PARTY WITH PLANS. TO IMPAIR. IF THERE'S A WILL. WHEN THE CONTRACT AM I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT THAT EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AS AS A VERY IT'S A- KIND OF A START. HERE'S NINETEEN HUNDRED PHYSICIANS THAT LIVE IN THESE COUNTIES AND HAVE A- ACTIVE LICENSE FROM THE BOARD. WHETHER THEY TAKE MEDICARE WHETHER THEY'RE IN THEIR SPECIALIST WHETHER THEY- HAVE AN OPEN PANEL WHETHER WE'VE ALREADY REACHED OUT TO THEM AND THEY SAID NO. AGAIN CHALLENGES WITH DIRECTORIES AND LISTS. IT'S A LOT OF MORE LETTERS UNDER THERE THAT WE JUST NEED TO WORK THROUGH. SO I JUST DON'T WANT. THE COMMITTEE TO ACT TO- LARGE NUMBERS KING. ASSUMING THAT THE NINETEEN HUNDRED ARE ONES THAT. WHETHER IT IS A MODEL NINETEEN WHO WOULD BECOME INTO MANAGED CARE TOMORROW BECAUSE I JUST WANT TO CAUTION THAT. ON THE LAST SIX YEARS OF EXPERIENCE MYSELF AS A PHYSICIAN GOING OUT THERE. MEETING WITH PHYSICIANS THAT THAT ARE WITH WITH THE CONTRACTING WITH US AND. AND ONCE THAT DOWN. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THAT BLACK AND WHITE. ANOTHER. IT'S DIFFICULT TO MAKE DETERMINATIONS BASED ON DIFFERENCES IN OPINION BUT YOU KNOW TO. YOU KNOW YOU JUST WANT TO GIVE US A SAMPLE WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. IS THERE ARE MANDATES AND RECORD KEEPING FOR EXAMPLE HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD WITH DOUBT IF WE DON'T UNDERSTAND SOMETHING GIVEN EXAMPLE OF COURSE I'M EXAGGERATING BUT YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO ENGAGE THESE BOOKS TO ENSURE THAT THEY WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT THEY DON'T. SO HOW DO WE KNOW WHAT LOOKS LIKE TO YOU BY REACH OUT ONE TIME TWICE HOW. WE MAKE THIS BETTER LET ME ASK THE OTTER. QUESTION DO YOU HAVE A MANDATE TO. KEEP RECORDS OR WHAT CAN WE DO. WELL I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES NEEDS TO DO AND THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE HAVE RECOMMENDED TO THE DEPARTMENT SO IT SHOULDN'T BE A ONE AND DONE IT SHOULD BE PERIODICALLY THEY NEED TO BE LOOKING AT- ACCESS TO CARE WHEN THEY'RE WHEN THEY'RE CONSIDERING THE ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARDS IN DETERMINING WHETHER THEY'RE GONNA PROVE ANY ADDITIONAL STAND ADICIONAL ALTERED TAXES UNDER. THEY NEED TO BE ASKING THESE KINDS OF. AND THE THINGS WE HAD IN THE REPORT IS. I MEAN A PLAN WOULD SUGGEST WE DON'T HAVE ANY PROVIDERS IN THE REGION SO WE NEED AN ALTERNATE ACCESS STANDARD THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE UNFORTUNATELY OUR OUR BENEFITS YOUR TO DRIVE A HUNDRED FIFTY MILES WHAT WE WEREN'T SKIING HEALTHCARE SERVICE IS DOING IS CHALLENGING THAT PLAN AND SAYING. DEMONSTRATE TO US WITH DOCUMENT GEN WHAT TYPE HOW MANY YEARS DID YOU REACH OUT TO WHERE ARE THEY LOCATED WHAT TYPES OF PROVIDERS ARE THEY SO WE BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT OF CARE SERVICES NEEDS TO DO THAT ON A PERIOD. AWARE THAT THE COURT PLEASE YEARLY- I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT. SERVICES WE NEED TO DETERMINE BUT THAT WAS ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES WE HAD WITH RESPECT TO. THEIR DECISION MAKING IN APPROVING ALTERNATE ACCESS STANDARDS THEY WEREN'T CHALLENGING THE PLANS AND ARE YOU SEEKING. SUFFICIENTLY FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE WITH DOCUMENTATION AND WRITTEN JUSTIFICATIONS AS TO WHY IT FELT THEY NEEDED THESE ALTERNATE STAND. I THINK MY QUESTION MAYBE A LITTLE REDUNDANT. ASK ABOUT A REASONABLE RIGHT REASONABLE REASONABLE TâM SO I GUESS THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE THIS OUT YOU KNOW BECAUSE I WITHOUT HAVING YOU KNOW DOCUMENTATION A WRITTEN INFORMATION IT'S DIFFICULT BUT- YOU KNOW FORGIVE ME IF THIS UP A LITTLE REDUNDANT I JUST REALLY WANT UNDERSTAND THAT THANK YOU YOU. ANSWER QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU I A THAT WE I LOOK FORWARD TO SHARING WITH YOU SEE RUBY ON REST OF THE COMMITTEE THE ANSWERS FROM THE PARK HEALTHCARE SERVICES AS TO WHAT'S REASONABLE DEFINITION. I JUST HAVE ONE- BRIEF QUESTION AND THEN I KNOW WE'RE RUNNING BEHIND TIME IN REGARDS TO BUILDING PROVIDER NETWORKS AND MAYBE I'LL START WITH ACTUALLY. DOCTOR MILLER AND PARTNERSHIP FOR THIS WAY. TO WHAT DEGREE HE DOES AND AGAIN I'M GAS FOR VERY BRIEF EITHER YES NO OR VERY BRIEF EXPLANATION OUT TO WHAT DEGREE DOES. DOES THE HEALTH PLAN WORK WITH THE COUNTY TO HELP GET. PERHAPS TO GET PROVIDERS THEIR PHYSICIANS TO PARTICIPATE THE PLAN BECAUSE AFTER ALL MOST OF THESE POSITIONS ARE PART OF THE COMMUNITY AND IF THEY FEEL THAT THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY NOT JUST SOMEONE DISTANCE TRYING TO CONTRACT WITH THEM. SOME TO STEP UP. EXPERIENCE I'VE BEEN OUT JUST WAITED DOCTORS THAT TAKE PLANS- THAT DEBTS THAT OFTEN CAN CAN HELP SO. AND BUTTE HAVE YOU SEEN PLANS THEN BUTTE COUNTY GO AND ACTUALLY ENGAGED TO COUNTY AND SAID HEY WE NEED SOME PEOPLE SOME PARTICULAR- PHYSICIANS OR PHYSICIAN SPECIALTY CAN YOU HELP US WITH TRYING TO IDENTIFY SOME WHO MIGHT BE WILLING TO HELP US OUT. HOW LONG. YES OR NO OR- YES. SO I AM NOT SEEING A I'M NOT SURE THAT THE COUNTIES BE WELL POSITIONED TO HELP THAT WAY EVEN IF THEY DID OKAY WE HAVE WORKED ON OTHER THINGS START NOT THAT ISSUE OKAY AND PARTNERS ANY EXPERIENCE. THAT YOURSELF OR DO YOU AND- YOUR FOR. THERE'S A COUPLE THE PAYMENT WE HAVE. A LOCAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR. LEASE ONE ON OUR BOARD GOVERNOR ON OUR BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS. BUT WE ALSO REACH OUT OUR MEDICAL DIRECTORS REACH OUT WITH THE PROVIDERS IN THE COMMUNITY AND WE SEE WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE WE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO BRING PROVIDERS ARE DOING GAUGE PEOPLE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. OKAY YEAH WE'RE VERY SIMILAR APPROACH WE ACTUALLY ALSO HAVE OF. FOR HEALTH AND WELLNESS THAT DOES INCLUDE A PHYSICIAN FROM THE LOCAL COMMUNITY WHO EACH OF THE COUNTIES THAT NO JUST FROM IT'S FROM OUR LARGEST HEALTH SYSTEM WITHIN VIEW. DO YOU COUNTY AMPLA THEY SAID HE SAID OUR BOARD AND- WE ONLY FOR BUTTE THEN HE DOES BI&lt;c.cyan&gt; YUBA&lt;/c&gt; AND SUTTER OKAY BUT THE OTHER COUNTIES TRAFFIC YOU DON'T HAVE SOMEONE LIKE WE DO HAVE LOCAL OUR. LIVES WITH EACH COUNTY AND THEY DO ENGAGE WITH PHYSICIANS. ALSO ONLY IN THE COUNTY AT LEAST ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND ALL OF THEIR- LEADERSHIP WITHIN THAT THE LOCAL PROVIDER COMMITTEE ON MY PERSONAL CELL PHONE SO THEY ARE ALWAYS WELCOME TO. CALL ME AT ANY TIME IF THERE'S ANY PARTICULAR ISSUE THAT THE ADDRESSED IN THE- MISSION WE NEED TO ME QUITE THE WITH EVERY COUNTY AND IN THOSE MEETINGS. TAKE ME WITH THE COUNTY WILL TALK ABOUT COUNTY GOVERNMENT THAT YOU HAVE A HEALTH. THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ALL THE DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THAT COUNTY THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THE HEALTH CARE- LISA AND IN THE BACK IS THE ONE THAT THAT MEETS SO WE GET INPUT FROM THEM IN THAT IN THAT REGARD WE WORK WITH THEM. WHEN IT COMES TO- PROVIDE A RECRUIT WE WORK A LOT WITH THE HOSPITAL COUNCIL AND- DIFFERENT. ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE MORE ALIGNED OR AN INTEGRATED WITH THE PROVIDER. SPECIAL COUNSEL ON THE ALL THE CEOS OF THE MAJOR SETTLES ACROSS- THE WORLD COUNCIL SOCIETIES- YES MEDICAL SOCIETIES BUT MY I THINK FOR THE MEDICAL THAT CAN DEFINITELY NOT THE CMA BUT THERE ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF ORGANIZATIONS COUNTY MEDICAL SOCIETIES YEAH YEAH SIMILAR SYSTEM OF THOSE.YOU CAN YAK. YES WE WORK WITH THEM AS WELL- ACTUALLY BEEN FINDING SOME OF THEIRPROJECTS WE WORK WITH THOSE TYPES ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE MORE CONNECTED WITH. WHAT THE PROVIDER COMMUNITY OKAY ALRIGHT WELL I'M TRYING TO THINK ABOUT ORDERED MORE THINGS ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT. THE DANCE OF THOSE WORDS. ON'T BUT THERE ARE SOME ADVANTAGES TO DOING THAT CELL. OKAY WELL I WANT TO THANK THANK YOU OFFER PRESENTING ANIMAL THE AND THAT YOU YOU MUSCLE STATE GOOD ZERO FOR THE NEXT PANEL. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND. APPRECIATE THE ALTHOUGH I ALL THE WORK THAT YOU DO I KNOW IT CAN BE CHALLENGING IT IS A DIFFERENT POPULATION I DON'T LIKE NOR THAT IT CAN BE CHALLENGING TO PROVIDE ACCESS AND- RURAL COUNTIES AND- DOUBLE. DIAMOND CALIFORNIA THE WELLNESS IS DOING THAT AREA AS WELL THANK YOU. OKAY SO WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT REPORT. I THINK I GUESS YEAH YOU HAVE- SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AN AUDITOR AND- YOU'VE IT'S A MISTER COOPER IS THAT THE FIRST ON THIS ONE OKAY SO THIS IS THE RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE CALIFORNIA- DON'T SPREAD OF HEALTH SERVICES AND THIS MONTH RT IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS REPORTS OF THANK YOU AND WELCOME ME. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN PAN SENATOR RUBIO. AND MY NAME IS ELAINE HOW CALIFORNIA STATE UNDER WITH ME IS JOSHUA HOOPER JOSH WAS THE TEAM LEADER ON THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT THIS IS AN AUDIT THAT WE WERE ASKED TO DO- LATE LAST LATE AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN SHOULD DEPORT IN MARCH OF TWENTY NINE AND AS YOU INDICATED DOCTOR PAN ARE WE HAVE. SIX RESPONSE AND I WILL. SAID OF MY LEG. AND THEN MISTER HOOVER WELL STEP THROUGH. EMENDATIONS THAT WE'VE MADE AND AGAIN WE HAVE A SIX MONTH RESPONSE- SO HE WILL. DISCUSS WITH THE COMMITTEE. THE VARIOUS- STATUSES OF EACH OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. AT LEAST GROUPING MA'AM BYE BYE SUBJECT AREA SO THE FIRST AREA I'M NOT GONNA DIE IN TWO AND A LOT OF DETAIL BECAUSE THIS IS- THE CAR. OVER ISSUE THAT WE HAVE FROM THIS. NOT AND THE REPORT WE SPOKE ABOUT. THIS LATE WITH RESPECT TO ACCESS TO CARE APPROVAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND STANDARDS I WANTED TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT HOWEVER. THIS AUDIT REALLY FOCUSED ON. SERVICE HOLDREN AND MEDI CAL AS YOU SAID DR PAN THERE ARE. A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA NEARLY HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN RECEIVE THEIR MEDICAL SERVICES THROUGH MEDICARE ALL. 90% OF THOSE KIDS ARE IN AND AT PROVIDE RECEIVING SERVICE THROUGH A MANAGED CARE PLAN. WE ALSO LOOK UTILIZATION RATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY BASED ON PERMISSION. FEDERAL OUR PROGRAM MEDICID PROGRAM PROVIDES AND CAL UNFORTUNATELY RANKS RELATIVELY LOW AND HAS FOR A LONG TIME- AT THE POINT IN TIME WE LOOKED AT FEDERAL FISCAL YEARS.TWENTY SEVENTEEN DATA CAL YOU'RE RANKED FOR FORTIETH AMONG STATES. ENTRY AS FAR AS ASIAN PREVENTIVE SERVICES FOR CHILDREN ARE YOU. RATE AS A STATE- HAS BEEN BELOW YEARS WHEN WE CONDUCTED THE AUDIT. SO CLEARLY AN ISSUE THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO FOCUS ON- WITH RESPECT TO ACCESS TO CARE AGAIN I'M NOT GONNA GO INTO ALL THE DETAILS WE HAD THE SAME ISSUES IN THIS REPORT. THIS WAS ACTUALLY THE FIRST REPORT WHERE WE ISSUED. FINDINGS AND CONCERNS ABOUT THE HEALTH CARE SERVICES DECISION MAKING WITH RESPECT TO APPROVING ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARDS- OR REQUESTS AND- OF THE TEN THOUSAND THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT SIXTY EIGHT HUNDRED OF THOSE WERE FOR. FIGHTER PROVIDE. IS TO. A LOT STANDARD WERE RE APPROVED ARE FOR PROVIDERS IN THE- MANY OF THESE PLANS WE ACTUALLY DUG A LITTLE DEEPER AND DETERMINE WHAT WAS THE UTILIZATION RATE FOR THESE PLANS AND THE UTILIZATION RATE FOR CHILDREN FOR THESE PLANS THAT WERE ASKING FOR THESE ALTERNATE ACCESS STANDARDS. WAS AGAIN BELOW 50% SO THOSE ALL IDENTIFIED ISSUES FOR US WITH RESPECT TO ACCESS TO CARE AND CERTAINLY WE HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS WITH RESPECT TO OUR DEPARTMENT CARE SERVICES IN THEIR DECISION MAKING WITH RESPECT TO OUR APPROVING. ALTERNATE ACT THE STANDARDS. THE OTHER TWO THAT WE LOOKED AT WITH RESPECT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF CARE SERVICES AND ITS RESPONSIBILITIES- IS IT'S OVERSIGHT AND- THE FACT THAT THE CONCLUSION WE RATE IS WE FELT THAT THE DHS WAS. DELEGATING A LOT OF ITS RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE PLANS AND THE REASON WE SAY THAT IS THERE ARE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS IN FEDERAL LAW THAT CHILDREN RECEIVE EARLY PERIODIC SCREENING DIAGNOSTIC AND TREATMENT TREATMENT. DEPARTMENT HEALTH SERVICES BACK IN TWENTY FOUR IN ADOPTED THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS THE BRIGHT FUTURES SCHEDULE ESSENTIALLY A SCHEDULE OF SERVICES PREVENTIVE SERVICES THAT SHOULD BE PROVIDED CHILDREN- SO WE WERE EXPECTING THAT HEALTHCARE SERVICES WOULD HAVE VERY SPECIFIC EXPECTATIONS OF. THE PLAY TIMES TO MAKE SURE PROVIDERS WERE MY NAP IF YOU THEIR SCHEDULE- AND UNFORTUNATELY WHEN WE LOOKED AT CONTRACTS BETWEEN HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND THE PLANS THOSE CONTRACTS WERE NOT CLEAR AS TO WHAT. THE ACT RECALL WERE AS FAR AS WHAT THE EXPECTATIONS. OF PROVIDERS IN BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO CHILDREN THAT ARE ON THIS BRIGHT FUTURES ALL THESE PREVENTIVE SERVICES THAT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO CHILDREN WE WEREN'T SEEING WE DIDN'T THINK THOSE CONTRACTS WERE STRONG ENOUGH WE DIDN'T THINK THAT DEPARTMENT OF CARE SERVICES WAS REALLY CLEARLY COMMUNICATE TO THE ENDS AND THEREFORE THE PLANS WERE NOT INDICATING TO PROVIDE WHAT THE EXPECT HIS WORK BACK TO. PROVIDE SERVICES FOR CHILDREN. OTHER SIMILAR TO THAT WHERE YOU'RE LOOK AT MORE. AND SO TYPICALLY THE ADAGES IF YOU MEASURE SOMETHING AND YOU MEASURE AGAINST SOMETHING PEOPLE ARE GOING TO PERFORM AND SO WE LOOKED AT PERFORMANCE TRICKS- FOR THE BRIGHT FUTURE SCHEDULE SO THERE ARE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TIME FRAMES AND THE TIME FRAME THAT HEALTH CARE SERVICES WAS HOLDING. UP PLANS ACCOUNTABLE TO WE SAW HIGH UTILIZATION RATES AND THAT WAS AGES THREE TO SIX TIPPER UTILIZATION RATES FOR CHILDREN AND THOSE AGE GROUPS BETWEEN SIXTY AND SEVENTY CENTS. AS A LOT OF THE OTHER AGE GROUP ALTHOUGH AGES EIGHT TWENTY DROPPED OFF SIX. BILLION IN CASE THEIR WORK. SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE 50% OR THE AVERAGE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO. WE FELT THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF CARE SERVICES NEEDS TO MAKE SURE THAT AGAIN THE PLANS UNDERSTANDING THEY NEED TO FOLLOW THE RIGHT FEW SCHEDULE. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THE PROVIDING THE SERVICES TODAY FROM THE FROM INFANCY ALL THE WAY UP THROUGH AGES EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY. WHICH IS INCLUDED ON THAT BRIGHT FUTURES PLAN. SCHEDULE EXCUSE ME. INTO THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT THE MEDICAL AUDITS THAT I REFERRED TO EARLIER AND WHETHER OR NOT THOSE MEDICAL ARTS WE'RE REALLY FOCUSING ON. THE PREVENTIVE SERVICES FOR CHILDREN- AND WE DIDN'T SEE A LOT OF INFORMATION IN THE AUDITS WHERE THEY WERE REALLY DRILLING DOWN TRYING TO IDENTIFY ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO HOLDEN RECEIVING PER OF SERVICES FROM PROVIDERS AND PLANS I'M SURE. I'LL SERVICES WERE AVAILABLE MITCHELL AND BETTER. SPECIFICALLY ALSO LOOKING AT DOCTOR BUT WHEN HE REQUESTED US TO DO THIS WORK HE WAS ALSO INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC ISSUES. ARE IS HEALTHCARE SERVICES PROACTIVE DRESSING CULTURAL DISPARITIES ARE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT. BENEFICIARIES HAVE INFORMATION IN THE LANGUAGE THEIR PRIMARY LAST SPOKEN LANGUAGE RATHER THAN JUST ENGLISH ARE ARE THEY ENSURING THAT THEY'RE DOING ANALYSES OF VARIOUS REGIONS TO SEE ARE THERE CULTURAL DIFFERENCES AND ARE THERE. INDIVIDUALS FROM DIFFERENT DIFFERENT ETHNICITIES THAT ARE NOT YOU WILL YOU USING PREVENTIVE SERVICES FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO AS A STATE HAT IS HEALTH CARE SERVICES NEED TO DO AS FAR AS REQUIRING. THIS TO ME SURE AT UNDERSTAND WHO THE FISHERIES ARE THERE ARE CULTURAL BARRIERS AND LINGUISTIC BARRIERS YOU TO DEAL WITH WE NEED TO ADDRESS THOSE AND WE DIDN'T THINK HEALTH CARE SERVICES WAS DOING AT A JOB THAT COULD SHOW UP. TO MAKE SURE. AND FOR THE PROVIDERS. FULL WHAT WE DIDN'T SEE IS- HEALTH CARE SERVICES MAKING SURE THAT THEY WERE SHARING ALL OF THE INFORMATION NOT JUST WITH RESPECT TO THE TO THE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS BECAUSE THOSE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL. OTHER ISSUES WHERE PLANS HAVE ADDRESSED SOME CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY HEALTH CARE SERVICES WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE SHARING ESSENTIALLY BEST PRACTICES OR STRATEGIES THAT ARE THAT. VARIOUS PLANS WERE USING TO TRY TO GET REALIZATION RATES UP. WE SAW THAT THEY HAD SOME PERIODIC CALLS QUARTERLY CALLS QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORTS BUT AGAIN WE THINK THOSE COULD BE MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND MORE BENEFICIAL TO. THE VARIOUS PLANS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE AWARE OF ANY STRATEGIES THEY COULD USE TRY TO INCREASE. THE AND EDUCATE THE FISHER ABOUT THE ABILITY TO GET AND IF SERVICES FOR THEIR CHILDREN. AND THEN THE LAST FEW WAS RELATED. ON THESE EXTERNAL QUALITY REVIEWS ARE THERE ARE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT HE Q. R. E. Q. R. OVER HIS MAKING THEIR EXTERNAL QUALITY OUR REVIEW ORGANIZATION VARIETY OF DIFFERENT RECOMMENDATIONS WITH RESPECT TO ACCESS WITH RESPECT TO QUALITY OF CARE WHEN WE LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. WE SAW THAT. THE OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS NOT BEEN FULLY AMPLE I HEALTHCARE SERVICES SO. WE MAY STATIONS THAT YOU NEED TO REALLY FOCUS ON THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AND TRY TO GET THEM IMPLEMENTED QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AND YOU KNOW THAT EXT ONLY REVIEW VERY SPECIAL WE'VE GOT A FOLLOW THROUGH. AND DOES RECOMMEND. SO I'M VERY HIGH LEVEL THE KEY ISSUES IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT AS I SAID WE ARE. IN MARCH OF NINETEEN WE DID RECEIVE US A SIX MONTH RESPONSE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CARE SERVICES SO MISTER HOOPER WILL STEP YOU THROUGH AND IN THE VARIOUS BUCKETS- WHAT ARE KEY RECOMMENDATIONS WERE AND WHAT THE STATUS IS AS FAR AS DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES PROGRESS. IN IMPLEMENTING THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. FOR THE RECORD MY NAME IS JOSH COOPER I WAS THE TEAM LEAD ON THIS AUDIT. AS THE STATE AUDITOR SAID ARE OUT IT LOOKED AT- THE DELIVERY OF PREVENTIVE SERVICES TO CHILDREN AND MEDI CAL. TO THAT END WE HAD FOURTEEN RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DH CS- DHS IS SAID THAT IT WILL NOT IMPLEMENT ONE OF THOSE FOURTEEN. BUT THAT IT IT HAS IT WILL IMPLEMENT THE OTHER THIRTEEN. WE ISSUED THIS REPORT IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR- AND SO IN SEPTEMBER DE ACS ISSUED AT SIX RESPONSE. AT THAT POINT- IT HAD NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED ANY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS FAR FROM OUR REPORT. I'M GONNA GO OVER THOSE NOW- WE HAVE THOSE FOURTEEN RECOMMENDATIONS BROKEN DOWN INTO FOUR CATEGORIES- THE FIRST IS ACCESS THE SECOND IS OVERSIGHT- THE THIRTY SHARE. AND THE FOURTH- IT HAS TO DO WITH UTILIZING THOSE AYE EXTERNAL QUALITY REVIEW ORGANIZATION TOOLS THAT THEY HAVE. THE FIRST RECORD ASIAN IN THE ACCESS CATEGORY. WAS THE DH CS SHOULD IDENTIFY AREAS WHERE MORE PROVIDERS WERE NEEDED- AND THEN TO RECRUIT MORE PROVIDERS IN THOSE AREAS- USING- REQUESTING FUNDING IN INCREASES AS NECESSARY. THIS IS THE RECOMMENDATION THE DE CSS SAID IT WITH MY EMPLOYMENT DHS IS POINTED TO ITS LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM HOWEVER WE. WE FOUND THAT DH CS COULD. SHOULD NOT LIMIT WHAT IT DOES TO JUST THAT ONE SINGLE PROGRAM. THE SECOND ACCESS RECOMMENDATION HAD TO DO WITH- CLARIFYING ITS CONTRACTS THAT THERE THE PLANS ARE REQUIRED TO EAT DELIVER BRIGHT FUTURES. DC HAS INDICATED IT FULLY INTO THAT- RECOMMENDATION- BUT IT HAS NOT YET UPDATED THE CONTRACTS. THE THIRD RECOMMENDATION WISE- THAT IT SHOULD UPDATE IT'S WRITTEN MATERIALS- TO TWO MEMBERS- AND DHS IS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED THAT RECOMMENDATION. IN THE OVERSIGHT CATEGORY- AGAIN DHS IS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED ANY OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS THE FIRST WAS TO UTILIZE THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT THE STATE AUDITOR MENTIONED- TO- IN CAPS LATE ALL AGES AND NOT JUST CHILDREN IN A CERTAIN AGE GROUP. THE SECOND WAS TO IMPLEMENT AUDIT PROCEDURES- THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO UTILIZATION OF CHILDREN'S PREVENTIVE SERVICES. THE THIRD WAS TO. IS IT TAKE TO USE ITS UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM TO ADDRESS UNDER UTILIZATION- SPECIFIC TO CHILDREN'S PREVENTIVE SERVICES. THE FOURTH WAS THAT IT SHOULD- ENSURE BETTER ACCURACY AND PLAN PROVIDER DIRECTORIES. THE FIFTH IS THAT IT SHOULD USE ITS HEALTH DISPARITY STUDY- TO DRIVE TARGETED INTERVENTIONS- WHEN THERE ARE- HEALTH DISPARITIES BETWEEN CHILDREN OF DIFFERENT ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS IN LANGUAGE NEEDS. AND THE SIX IN THE OVERSIGHT CATEGORY WAS THAT DH CS SHOULD USES. SHOULD REQUIRE PLANS TO USE THE GROUP IN THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT REPORTS- TO ALSO FOLLOW UP. TO ADDRESS FINDINGS THAT STEM FROM THOSE REPORTS. IN THE SHARING CATEGORY THERE WERE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MADE TO DH CS THE FIRST IS THAT IT SHOULD IDENTIFY EFFECTIVE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS IN IN THE VARIOUS PLANS AND THEN SHARED THOSE- HOSE EFFECTIVE INCENTIVE PROGRAM. ALL OF THE PLANTS. DHS IS SAID THAT IT. THAT RECOMMENDATION- BUT IT IS NOT YET. GOTTEN AROUND TO IT THE SECT SHARING RECOMMENDATION HAD TO DO ASSURING THE RESULTS OF SEX- SUCCESSFUL STRATEGIES FROM ITS CORRECTIVE ACTION PROGRESS- PROCESS THE PLAN TO STUDY ACT PROCESS- DCS HAS BEGUN COLLECTING CAM SUCCESSFUL STRATEGIES BUT IT HAS NOT YET SHARED THOSE. THE PLANTS. AND IN THE LAST CATEGORY HAD TO DO WITH BETTER UTILITY. A REVIEW OR TOOLS- WE HAD RECOMMENDATIONS THAT DH CS- SHOULD USE MORE RECENT DATA AND MORE OFTEN- TO VALIDATE THE DATA THAT IT HAS- WE HAD A RECOMMENDATION- THAT IT SHOULD USE THAT HE GROWS- THEY SHOULD IMPLEMENT THE EQUALS REP RECOMMENDATIONS RELATE TO CHILDREN PREVENTIVE SERVICES. AT A RECOMMENDATION DCS. IN ASSESSMENT OF THE PLANT THE ACTIONS THAT PLANTS HAVE TAKEN TO ADDRESS THE EGRESS RECOMMENDATIONS I IN ALL THREE OF THOSE HAVE NOT YET BEEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED. OKAY THANK YOU. QUESTIONS JUST TO. ONE QUESTION- SO IS YOU MAY NOTE IN THE REPORT THEAGE RANGES ON WHICH THE DTS ACTUALLY MONITORS PERFORMS MUCH BETTER THAN THE OTHER AGE RANGES. THAT'S CORRECT SO THAT TO ME IMPLIES THAT IF PEOPLE REALLY WANTED TO THEY COULD AT LEAST PERFORM AS WELL AS THAT. WE SHOULD STILL PERFORM BETTER BUT THEY COULD AT LEAST PERFORM AS WELL AS THOSE AGE RANGES WHERE SHE BASICALLY- UP AROUND BETWEEN OF BELOW 50% I GUESS FORTY NINE PERCENT. DID YOU- IDENTIFY IN THE AUDITS- THINGS THAT WERE DONE DIFFERENTLY FOR THOSE AGE RANGES ASIDE FROM THE MONITORING- WATER PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH NOT HITTING PERFORMANCE TARGETS ARE IT IT DIFFERENCES FOR THAT IS AGE RANGES BAND FOR THE OTHER- AGES AND WHICH DIVERSE. BE ASIDE FROM THE OTHER TRADE CONSEQUENCES RELATED TO THAT. YES DR AS YOU MENTIONED- BECAUSE IT WAS A PERFORMANCE BECAUSE IT WAS SOMETHING THAT THEY WERE HOLDING THE PLANS ACCOUNTABLE FOR WE FOUND THAT. THE REALIZATION RATES WERE MUCH HIGHER IN THOSE AREAS- THEY WERE NOT HOLDING PLANS ACCOUNTABLE FOR PERFORMANCE FOR DELIVERING PREVENTIVE SERVICES FOR THE- THE H. ONE AND TWO YEAR OLDS AND FOR THE CHILDREN WHO ARE OVER SIX RESULT. SO THERE WAS A DIFFERENT. HAVE SOMEONE DIDN'T HITTER PERFORMANCE MEASURE ON AGES THEY WERE MONITORING DID. THAT'S THAT'S DO YOU HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT I CAN ASK EACH YES. YEP WE ACTUALLY DID REVIEW THAT WE FOUND THAT- DHS MENTIONED WHEN THEY WERE UP HERE BEFORE THEY MENTIONED THAT THEY HAVE. WAYS TO HOLD AND ACCOUNTABLE- THEY DO. HAVE A PROCESS FOR ISSUING SANCTIONS BUT WE FOUND IN OUR REPORT- THEY HADN'T DONE THAT THEY HAD ACTUALLY ISSUED SANCTIONS- UP UNTIL THE POINT WHEN WE STARTED OUR REPORT. AFTER WE STARTED OUR REPORT WE NOTED THAT THEY DID- IT THAT- METHOD OF HOLDING THE PLANS ACCOUNTABLE. OKAY Q. AND I HOPE THAT WE SHOULD REDO THE SUDDEN FIGHT IN A FEW YEARS AND SEE WHERE WE ARE. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. OKAY AS THE PART HEALTHCARE TO COME BACK UP. I SHOULD PERHAPS DISCLOSE- THAT I AM A MEDIC HOW. POSITION TO PROVIDES WELL CHILD CARE SO I HAVE DIRECT PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. I'LL JUST PUT THAT OUT THERE. WELL WHERE'S. I LOOK FOR SERVICEMEN. THIS AGAIN SHERMAN AND ANSWER RUBIO- THE DH CS IS WHAT WAS WHAT IMPACT THEIR WE KNOW IS A VERY SUBSTANTIAL- NUMBER RECOMMENDATIONS I KNOW THERE WAS A HEARING ON THIS EARLIER IN THE YEAR WITH SOME OF THESE THINGS WERE DRESSED BUT AGAIN JUST TO REPEAT WHAT. WAS SAID BEFORE. DHS TAKE FINDING SERIOUSLY A AND THE AND I BELIEVE TAKE. CONCEPTS IMPLEMENT A COMPREHENSIVE ACTION PLAN IN RESPONSE TO IT- DSS RECOGNIZES THE STANDS BEHIND THE IMPORTANCE OF KIDS OR CHILDREN OF THE SEATING. APPROPRIATE PREVENTIVE. SERVICES AND THE RIGHT SETTING UP PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME- WE DID RECENTLY SUBMIT A OR SIX MONTH RESPONSE TO THE AUDIT- AND LIKE TO KIND OF THIS ROLE AT A HIGH LEVEL COVER JUST A COUPLE OF A FEW OF THE- YEAH. ACTION ITEMS ARE COMPLETED AND THEN AND THEN MAY WHAT KIND. SO WE HAVE CHANGED CAL MANAGED CARE PLAN ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES TO ALIGN WITH FEDERAL COURSE THAT MEASURES WHAT THE SAME TIME INCREASING THE MINIMUM PERFORMANCE LEVEL FOR THESE MEASURES. WE ARE ISSUING UP A REVISED EARLY AND PERIODIC SCREENING DIAGNOSTIC AND DIAGNOSTIC AND TREATMENT EPS TO TEASE IS KNOWN ALL PLAN LETTER AND EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE. BOTH OF WHICH BETTER DELINEATE HEALTH PLAN RESPONSIBLE IS PERTAIN TO THESE SERVICES. ANNA SHARING BEST PRACTICES AMONG HEALTH PLANS INTO THE PROJECT DST SERVICES. IN ADDITION IS COMPLETED ITEMS THE DEPARTMENT IS ENGAGED IN AND OUT WHICH PLAN WHICH WILL TOUCH ALL BENEFICIARIES AND THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE. A REMINDER OF THE IMPORTANCE OF RECEIVING THESE. INDIVIDUALS MAY BUT ACCESS THEM. THE FARMERS OF MANY A NEW HEALTH DISPARITIES REPORTING REPORT A PREVENTIVE SERVICES UTILIZATION REPORT ONGOING ENCOUNTER DATA VALIDATION STUDIES AND NEW HEALTH PLAN CONTRACT LANGUAGE PERTAIN TPS ET. I'M AGAIN- MERRY HERE'S AND TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS AND MORE DETAIL BUT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE HIGHER LEVEL THINGS I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE COMPLETED OR ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHT FOR THE COMMITTEE MAJOR STEPS FORWARD SO SURE THING. YEAH WELL THE PERMIT HEALTHCARE SERVICE TO GO INTO A BIT MORE DETAIL ON OF THOSE- AGAIN TAKEN A LOT OF ACTIONS. RELATED TO AUDIT BUT ALSO JUST UNDER THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF THE GOVERNOR AND HIS FOCUS ON EARLY CHILDHOOD REALLY REALLY WANTING TO MAKE SURE WERE. WERE DOING BETTER AND STARTING TO HIT THE MARK MORE ON ON WHAT'S NEEDED SO WITH RESPECT TO THE QUALITY METRICS I KNOW YOU HAD A QUESTIONS FOR THE AUDITOR'S ABOUT THAT. CHANGES THAT WE HAVE MADE AS- WE PREVIOUSLY HAD US UP YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY. THAT THE CORE MEASURES AS WHERE WE WERE HOLDING PLANS ACCOUNTABLE- AND THAT'S WHERE WE WOULD HAVE CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS AND THE POTENTIAL FOR FINANCIAL SANCTIONS. DIDN'T START IT IS CURRENT REPORTING HERE SO THIS YEAR THEY WILL BE BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO ALL OF THE CMS CORE MEASURES NOT JUST FOR CHILDREN BUT ALSO FOR ADULTS. AND AS MENTIONED HAVE INCREASED MINIMUM PERFORMANCE LEVEL TO BE THE AT THE NATIONAL MEDICAID FIFTIETH PERCENTILE. I WILL SAY AND I THINK I'VE I'VE SHARED. HE'S ON THIS WITH WITH YOU DOCTOR PAN AS WELL AS OTHERS THERE THERE ARE ALSO SOME. THE ART OF HOW SORT OF NAZARIAN COME MEASURING PERFORMANCE BASED ON JUST COMPARED OF NEST TO OTHER PLANS RIGHT SO BEING AT THE FIFTIETH PERCENTILE MEANS YOU'RE SORT OF. ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF ALL PLANNED ALL NATIONAL MEDICAID PLANS IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY SPEAK TO WHETHER ANY OF THE PEOPLE AT THE TOP ARE ACTUALLY DOING A GREAT JOB OR THE PEOPLE AT THE BOTTOM REALLY DOING A GOOD JOB SORT OF PARTICULARLY WHEN SOME OF THOSE MEASURES THAT ARE SORT OF. PRETTY CLOSE. I THINK YOU KNOW THE LARGER. METHODOLOGY WITH THE STANDARD WAY THAT. HEALTH QUALITY HAS HAS BEEN MEASURED IS REALLY THAT ISSUE OF IF EVERYBODY'S DOING BAD. THE BEST OF THE BAD IS STILL NOT GOOD ENOUGH I THINK YOU SEE THAT PARTICULARLY WITH THE WITH MEASURES AROUND KIDS. AND UNFORTUNATELY IN THE SUCH. AN OUT SCREENING MEASURES- BELIEVE THE NATIONAL MEDICAID- IMMEDIATE AS LIKE 12% OR EIGHTY IT'S SOMETHING LESS THAN 20% WHICH IS NOT DOES NOT OKAY. AND SO WHAT WE'VE ALSO IMPLEMENTED THAT MATT THAT IT. HAS BEEN THEY HAVE. BEEN SO REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU FALL NOT SOME TILE THIS IS REALLY WHERE YOU NEED TO BE SO WE- JUST INTO THE FIFTIETH PERCENTILE MEASURES ADDED FOR THOSE MEASURES BUT THAT THESE EXIST. THESE ABSOLUTE BENCHMARKS AND THAT IS FOR THIS REPORTING YEAR AND PLANS WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO BOTH OF THOSE THINGS SO THEY MAY PASS FIFTIETH. NET NATIONAL MEDICAID PERCENTILE PERFORMANCE BUT ACTUALLY PASSED THAT SALUTE BENCHMARK THAT THAT I PERSONALLY FEEL IS A BETTER. NEED TO BE DOING THERE ARE MEASURES UNFORTUNATELY THAT DON'T HAVE THOSE WORKS TODAY AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING THROUGH HOW DO WE ESTABLISH THOSE SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THAT ACROSS THE BOARD IN. HAVE BOTH THIS COMPARATIVE PERCENTILE METHODOLOGY BUT ALSO ABSOLUTE BENCHMARKS AND SO WERE WE ARE HOPING THAT WE CAN INSTITUTE THOSE FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY YEAR BUT WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT THAT WOULD ESTIMATE THAT ME AND- HOW WE BY MEASURE. FOR PLANS THAT DO NOT MEET WHETHER IT'S THE FIFTIETH. L. AND OR THE ABSOLUTE BENCHMARK- OUR CURRENT PROCESS NOW IS TO INSTITUTE IMMEDIATE FINANCIAL SANCTIONS JUST FOR FAILING TO MEET THAT. AS WELL AS UP PUT THEM INTO A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN WHERE WE CAN THEN WORK AND PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WHAT'S HAPPENING. ARE THERE SERVICE IS WHAT ARE THE TELL SERVICES AND OR CHALLENGES. BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY ADDRESS HOW MUCH WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND- ITS LACK. OF THAT THAT IS CUTTING SOME OF THESE ISSUES SO WE WOULD HAVE CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN WORK WITH MY TONE. AND THEN THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL SANCTION. PLAN ISN'T COMING. TO COME AND REALLY MEETING THOSE CORRECTIVE ACTION MILESTONE IF SET UP. WE HAVE AS THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED UPDATED OUR FACILITY SITE REVIEW WHICH WAS ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM. FROM THE AUDITOR'S AS WELL AS HAVE UPDATED AND IS CURRENTLY IN USE THE AUDIT PROCEDURES FOR THE MEDICAL RECORD REVIEW SO THAT WE ARE SEEING MUCH MORE ALIGNMENT AND MEASUREMENT OF WHAT THE BRIGHT FUTURES REQUIREMENTS ARE IDLE HANDS ARE AND SEEING WHERE PLANS ARE FALLING WITHIN THAT AND AGAIN. THESE ARE IDENTIFIED WE HAVE THIS IT. CAN BE THE SAME. CORRECTIVE ACTION AUSTIN I'M WE RESPECT TO YOU THAT YOU KNOW PART OF PART OF THE WORK ON OUR END IS ALSO TO ENHANCE OUR SYSTEMS AND DATA CAPABILITIES WE'VE HAD A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT SOMETIMES THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVEN'T EVEN PROVIDING ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AS WELL AS THE IN XIN THAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF MONITORING IS THAT THERE ARE LIMITATIONS IT SYSTEMS INSTRUCTOR CAN BE CHALLENGING. SO WE ARE IN AND SEARS TEAM REALLY QUITE HONEST DONE INTENSE AMOUNT OF WORK AND IMPROVE NOT ON THE PROVIDER PROVIDER SIDE AND WHO WHO ROLLED IN ALL OF THE BUT CAN TO IMPROVE TO CURRENTLY ON THE ENCOUNTER DATA SIDE WILL BE THAT HELLO DATA ABOUT WHAT SERVICES ARE BEING PROVIDED THAT MORE DETAILED GRANULAR LEVEL SO WE KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING IN A VISIT AND- NOT JUST. TO VISIT. BUT IN THE PREVIOUS TESTIMONY FROM. WE ARE WE HAVE DRAFTED AND WORKED ON THE NEW CONTRACT LANGUAGE WITH RESPECT PARTICULARLY TO THE E. PST T. IN BRIGHT FUTURES REQUIREMENTS THAT IS LANGUAGE WE HAVE BEEN SUBMITTING TO CMS- THE PROCESS FOR CONTRACT AMENDMENTS WITH THE MSL SAY IS NOT ALWAYS THE FASTEST AND- THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS THAT HAVE TO BE GOING ON BUT THOSE THOSE ARE AND THOSE ARE IN. PLACE AND WILL BE IN EFFECT FOR THE NINETEEN TWENTY CONTRACTOR THAT YEAR THAT WE ARE IN CURRENTLY. WITH RESPECT THE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE HEALTH TO. NAY NO AGAIN WE'VE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS WE HAVE BEGUN UP REPORTING ON THAT HEALTH DISPARITIES REPORT THAT WE THAT WE BUT WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT. WE ARE EACH YEAR AT A NEW MEASURES. AND WE IN INTO NOW THAT WERE GETTING TO THE PLACE OF HAVING THREE YEARS. ALSO ADDING THREE YOUR FRIEND. SO THAT WE CAN SEE WHAT'S CHANGING HOPEFULLY THE CHANGES ARE THAT THINGS ARE GETTING BETTER. BUT IF THEY'RE NOT HOW DO WE THEN SIR IMMEDIATELY ACTIVE. AND END AND LOOK AT WHAT WHERE WE- CHANGE. EITHER A MONITORING REQUIRE MEN OR- THAT ARE. ON THAT. ONCE YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS WE HAVE SEVERAL STAKEHOLDER WORK GROUPS AND PARTICULARLY ARE MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE ADVISORY GROUP WERE HOW DO WE CONTINUE TO HAVE ONGOING ENHANCEMENTS TO THAT EXPANSIONS OF THOSE REPORTS REALLY HAVING MORE GRANULAR DETAIL SO THAT EVEN IF IT LOOKS STATEWIDE THAT WE ARE IMPROVING IN CERTAIN AREAS WE KNOW THERE ARE POPULATIONS WHERE THEY'RE NOT THAT NOT THE CASE AND WE DON'T WANT THAT TO GET HIDDEN FOR. BREAKING INTO THE BRAND. THAT THAT WE NEED TO BE LOOKING. THE BASIC THE OUR RECOMMENDATION ESTABLISH A NEW REQUIREMENT THAT THE PLANS UTILIZED THE HEALTH DISPARITIES DATA AS WELL AS THE CONSUMER SATISFACTION FROM THE CAPS SURVEY TO DEVELOP A POPULATION NEEDS ASSESSMENT WHICH REALLY WAS AT THE CREATE A LITTLE BIT OF DIFFERENT WORDS BUT WAS WAS REALLY THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE AUDITOR. AND SO THEY'D HAVE TO NEEDS ASSESSMENT REALLY LOOKS. ALL BUT AT THESE MORE GRANULAR LEVEL OF LOOKING AT SPECIFIC POPULATIONS AND THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO SUBMIT OF THAT POPULATION NEEDS ASSESSMENT TO THE DEPARTMENT AND THEN HAVE AN ACTION PLAN TO ADDRESS THOSE AREAS WERE CLEAR THAT THAT THINGS ARE NOT WHERE THEY NEED TO BE IT WE DO ANTICIPATE THAT FIRST REPORT TO BE DUE TO. TWENTY TWENTY. WHERE I FEEL LIKE THAT'S- REALLY ONLY ONCE. ALSO AND I KNOW CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD WITH THE DOCTOR PAN ABOUT INCREASING THE FREQUENCY OF THE CAPS SURVEY SO WE ARE MOVING THAT FROM EVERY THREE YEARS TO EVERY TWO YEARS- AND NOT IN A STARTING NOW SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THAT MORE REGULARLY. AGAIN ANOTHER PLEASE WE'RE WERE FOLLOWING THE RECOMMENDATIONS IS REALLY HAVE WORKING WITH OUR EACH YOU ARE ROAD TO DEVELOP A PREVENTIVE SERVICES REPORT THAT WILL USE OUR ENCOUNTER DATA TO LOOK AT WHAT IS USUALLY WHAT IS UTILIZATION HAPPENING AGAIN BROKEN DOWN AN APPROPRIATE CATEGORIES AND SEEING WHERE THERE ARE LAPSES AND THEN HOW TO WEAVE CONTINUALLY FOLLOW UP WITH OUR PLAN AND OUR PROVIDERS AND AGAIN THROUGH THE BREACH CAMPAIGN THAT YOU HEAR ME DISCUSSING A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL. GET THOSE. BUT WE- WITH OUR STAY COOL AND ARE EACH YOU ARE- TO FINALIZE THE METHODOLOGY OF THE METRICS FOR THAT REPORT WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE REALLY CAPTURING WHAT IT IS PEOPLE THINK WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN MAKE IT MOST USEFUL NOT JUST FOR US BUT FOR YOU AND ARE STAKEHOLDER GROUPS THAT REALLY OPEN FORM WHAT POLICY. CHANGES AND OTHER THINGS WE MAY NEED TO SEE. A MINORITY MENTIONED. PROVIDER DIRECTORY VALIDATION ON THE LAST SECTIONS ALL OF US GET OVER THAT EVEN THOUGH IT WAS RELATED TO THIS AUDIT- AND THEN REALLY THE LAST THING THAT REALLY CAME OUT OF OUR THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE DO BETTER IN SPOTS THE AUDIT IS THAT STATEWIDE OUTREACH PAIN- WHAT THE THINGS WE ARE PLANNING- ONE IS JUST A STATEWIDE LETTER MAIL. WELL HOW OLD TO HAVE CHILDREN NEWS UP TO THE AGE OF TWELVE GIVEN THE. HE UP AND AGE EXPLAINING WHAT SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE AND HOW DO THEY ACCESS THEM WE ALSO ARE LOOKING TO DO A TARGETED CAMPAIGN FOR THOSE HOUSEHOLDS WHERE THERE ARE CHILDREN AND YOUTH UP TO TWENTY ONE WHO HAVE AND- TEST THOSE PREVENTIVE STE. IS IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS. I'M AND REALLY FOCUS ON THAT WE DID SEE A LOT OF SIX THAT. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HERE THAT WHEN WE DID THIS ON THE DENTAL SIDE WE SAW VERY SIGNIFICANT TAKE UP OF KIDS WHO HADN'T BEEN SEEN GETTING STE IN IT IS SORT OF IN THAT YEAR AND REALLY BUILD OFF OF THAT AND- ARE WE WE'VE DONE IT MUCH MORE. NOW DENTAL OUTREACH WITH THEIR SMILE CAMPAIGN THAT IT CAN WE CONTINUE TO SEE A LOT OF BENEFITS FROM AND SO REALLY TRYING TO BUILD OFF THAT SUCCESS- BUT WANTING TO OF COURSE ALSO CONTINUE. GAUGE STAKEHOLDERS ON ARE THOSE HITTING RIGHT MARKS WHAT HOW DO WE DEVELOP THOSE MATERIALS IN A WAY THAT OUR READERS. THE BALL AT AND CAN LEAD. YOU TO HELP OUR PARENTS OR OTHER. WITH CHILDREN USE THAT UP TO THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE- THE BENEFIT OF REALLY HAVING THE PLANS DO THIS IS THAT OUR INTENTION ARE REQUIRED. IN THEM WILL NOT TO JUST HAVE IT BE A GENERIC CALL WHERE THEY SAY THE SAME THING TO EVERY HOUSEHOLD THAT THEY CALL. BUT IN FACT GIVEN THE DATA THEY HAVE ABOUT WHAT SERVICES HAVE OR HAVE NOT BEEN ACCESS REALLY TARGET THAT CONVERSATION. THOSE HOUSEHOLDS SO THAT THEY KNOW. YOUR CHILD HAS GOTTEN THIS OR HASN'T GOTTEN THIS HOW CAN WE HELP YOU SCHEDULE YOUR APPOINTMENT WITH YOUR PROVIDERS IN ORDER TO GET THOSE SERVICES. I ALSO JUST WANT TO BRIEFLY TOUCH ON SOME OTHER THINGS THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO THE RESPONSES TO THE AUDITS BUT THAT WE'VE ALSO BEEN ENGAGING IN AND OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF. A LOT OF THINGS HAVE GONE THROUGH THAT. BUDGET IS WHERE FIVE THINGS. THE VALUE BASED PAYMENT PROGRAM I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA ASK ABOUT IT SO IT JUST STARTED JULY ONE AND WE DO HAVE SPECIFIC MESSRS EARLY CHILDHOOD WE DON'T HAVE RESULTS AND IT JUST STARTED I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW A YEAR OR SO AND WE CAN HAVE THAT. THE ON PROPOSITION FIFTY SIXTY MINUTE MAN SOME OF WHICH ARE VERY SPECIFIC. TARGETED CHILDREN. SERVICE RG UPCOMING JANUARY IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TVPA SCREENINGS AND THE DEVELOP SCREENINGS. AND THEN AGAIN I WOULD REFER BACK TO THAT CALLIE IN PROPOSAL AND A LOT OF PLACES WERE TRYING TO AFFECT KIDS I THINK SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT. TOUCH ON THAT WEREN'T SPECIFIC TO THIS AUDIT BUT IT. SIGNIFICANT SUGGESTED ENGINE. PARTICULARLY ON THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SIDE. TO IMPROVE STREAMLINED AND MAKE SURE KIDS HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE SERVICES AND AREN'T FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS BETWEEN THE MULTIPLE DELIVERY SYSTEMS. SO I WILL STOP THERE. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION I WANT TO WELCOME AS CHAIR OF THE SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE- BACK TO WOOD- IF YOU WANT TO TAKE A BREATHER I CAN START WITH SOME QUESTIONS. TO ROUTE OR IF YOU WISH. REMARKS SO YOU DO THAT. OKAY THANK YOU SIR RUBIO. I JUST A REAL QUICKLY. YOU MENTIONED THE PERCENTILE VERSUS THE ABSOLUTE BENCH MARKET AND TRACKS YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE GOING TO DEVELOP THAT ARE THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DEVELOPED SO WHEN WOULD WE SEE THOSE METRICS. SURE SO I AM. TRADITIONALLY IT'S ALL BEEN PERCENTILE BASE TO DO WE INCREASE THAT MINIMUM PERCENTILE THAT'S REALLY A COMPARISON. RIGHT HOW DO PLANTS COMPARE TO OTHER AND MEDICAID PLANS NATIONALLY FOR THE ABSOLUTE BENCHMARKS THERE ARE- FROM THE- NATIONAL COMMITTEE ON QUALITY ASSURANCE SINCE I ONLY EVER SAY THE ACRONYM. THERE ARE FIRST MOVE THOSE CMS MEASURES OF THOSE ABSOLUTE BENCHMARK SO WE'VE IMPLEMENTED THOSE. THEN THERE ARE SOME THAT DON'T SAT AND THAT'S THE ONES WERE TRYING TO DEVELOP AND MAKE SURE THAT. WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT WHAT'S AN APPROPRIATE AND THAT THEN WE WOULD BE ADDING IN ADDITION TO THE THINGS THAT WE'VE ALREADY PUT IN DOES THAT MAKE SENSE YES. THANK YOU FOR THEIR- AND TO THINK. THIS IS THE BENCHMARK THEN THE APPS. FOR ALSO PROVISIONS SCREENING FOR CHILDREN. YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW THAT AFTER. MY I WE WILL GET BACK TO YOU WITH EVERY ABSOLUTE BENCHMARK THAT WE HAVE THAT WE ARE MEASURING OF FOLKS WITH I KNOW THE TEAM KNOWS THAT I. OKAY MANY THINGS I KEEP IN MY HEAD AND THAT THAT'S ONE. WELL SINCE THAT'S THE TOPIC OF THIS. AUDIT BUT I APPRECIATE OKAY BACK TO ME ON THAT CAN YOU REPEAT THAT THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION THAT YOU GET THE BENCHMARKS FROM QUITE. CONCEDED RIGHT THE LAST PART NATIONAL COMMITTEE ON QUALITY ASSURANCE. IN SECURE TESTING MY ACRONYM KNOWLEDGE DO OKAY SO. SO YEAH I APPRECIATE GETTING THE ABSOLUTE BENCH RIGHT SO. I KNOW THIS MAY SEEM A LITTLE TANGENT DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DO YOU KNOW THE HISTORY THE TSTT PROGRAM AND WHY WE HAVE IT. DO I LIKE DANGER I MEAN IT'S OF INTEREST. WHY WHY CONGRESS PASSED IT. NO I DON'T OKAY I JUST SAY BRIEFLY IT WAS PASSED ACTUALLY AS A RESULT OF A VALUATION OF DRAFTEES FOR THE VIETNAM WAR THEY MADE NOTES AS DATE DRAFTED YOUNG MEN TO FIGHT IN THE VIETNAM WAR THAT MANY OF THEM WHO COULD NOT QUALIFY FOR MILLER SERVICE HAD PREVENTABLE CONDITIONS. THAT THEY WERE ONLY PICKED UP IN CHILDHOOD NOW I WILL SAY THAT'S NOT MY MAIN PURPOSE FOR TRYING TO DO THIS BUT IT WAS A NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE. AND THAT'S WHY CONGRESS PASSED THE PS TWO. WE MAKE HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE THINGS WERE TRYING TO ACHIEVE FOR EXAMPLE IS- TRAUMA INFORMED CARE WE'RE GOING TO SCREEN FOR ASUS. BUT IF ONLY LESS THAN HALF OF ALL THE CHILDREN ARE SHE COMING IN FOR- HEALTH SUPERVISION THAT MEANS RUNNING A BE SCREENING HAVE TWO KIDS THAT SAY THEY COULD BE SCREEN AND SOME OTHER VISITS BUT- THIS IS THOSE THAT'S THE PLACE TO BE SCREENING SELF. TO ME THIS IS VERY TIGHT END WITH OTHER AT THAT WE'RE DOING. THE OTHER THING I WOULD MAKE NO TO SAY LOOK AT OTHERS CHART- SO WE DO EMPHASIZE THAT THE YEARS IN WHICH THEY AT WHICH THEY ARE MONITORED FOR MUCH BETTER SWITCH WOODS SAYS TO ME THAT. WE CAN DO BETTER. WITHOUT THAT WE CAN DO EVEN BETTER THAN THAT BUT EVEN JUST WHAT WE'RE DOING. ACTUALLY FOCUSED BUT WHAT WAS PARTICULARLY SCARY HE WAS IS THAT. THE NUMBER OF VISITS FOR ONE YEAR OLDS. OKAY THINK ABOUT ALL DEVELOPMENTAL CHANGES THAT HAPPEN IN THAT FIRST THAT SO WE WILL TALK ABOUT AUTISM. OTHER DEVELOPMENTAL CONDITIONS. IS AROUND. LOW ABOUT 40% AND THEN TWO YEAR OLD AGAIN SPEECH DELAY YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT ALL THE EXPENSE WE SPEND ON THINGS LIKE SPECIAL EDUCATION. OTHER PARTS OF THE BUDGET DID THEY DID THAT. KIDS BEING BEHIND FOR THEIR STARTING SCHOOL SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT. WE ARE LIKE 25% I MEAN THAT'S A HUGE MISSED OPPORTUNITY. YEAH I THAT THAT THAT I MEAN THAT THAT THAT'S A TRAVESTY. I THINK THAT THAT IS MISS CAVELL NINETEENTH WHEN THE REASONS WHY WE NEED TO HAVE A VERY STRONG OUT REACH PROGRAM. NO I DON'T THINK I. DID THE OTHER THING I WOULD MAKE NOTE AND I APPRECIATE THAT THOSE THE DEPARTMENTS IS SENDING LETTERS AND THE PLANS. THE OTHER PEOPLE WE NEED TO AND- IS THAT ACTUALLY THE RELATIONSHIP THE PATIENT SHOULD HAVE THIS WITH THEIR- PHYSICIAN AND OTHER PROVIDERS AND THAT. WHEN THEY GET THE LETTER FROM THEM. NOW I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT YOU KNOW I'M A PROPONENT MANAGED CARE I GET FOR MEMBER PER MONTH BUT- THESE ARE PREVENTIVE SERVICES THAT EVERY CHILD YET. RIGHT I MEAN THERE'S NO REASON THEY SHOULDN'T GET IT. I ASSUME THERE'S NO DISAGREEMENT ON THAT. I SO IN MANY WAYS ONE COULD ARGUE THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAPITATE THIS IS LIKE OKAY YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE THIS MANY KIDS IN YOUR PLAN. IF YOU PROVIDE THEM. YOU GET PAID IF YOU DON'T YOU DON'T GET PAID. BECAUSE THE YOU ACTED TO EVERYONE WHO DOESN'T GET THE VISIT WHY ARE THEY BEING PAID FOR IT. THEY SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PAY THAT OFF OF NOT PROVIDING CARE. I MEAN THIS IS NOT ONE OF THESE WELL WE'RE MANAGING THE CARE MAYBE THEY SHOULD HAVE COME FOR THAT VISIT. CORRECT I MEAN DO YOU. IS THERE DISCRIMINANT. OKAY SO WE TALK ABOUT FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH SUPERVISION PREVENTION LIKE THIS. THE EXPECTATION SHOULD BE EVERY CHILD WHO YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SHOULD GET THEIR VISIT ON SCHEDULE AND IF THEY'RE NOT. WHY WE PAY YOU FOR THAT. RIGHT. THAT SHOULD BE THE EXPECTATION IT DEFINITELY IS THE EXPECTATION I THINK YOU KNOW THAT THE COMPLEXITIES OF HOW TO DO THAT PARTICULAR I GET IT FROM AN ACTUARIAL RATE PER UNIT YOU AS WHAT WE WE'VE HAD A LOT OF RATE RIGHT CONVERSATIONS IS ALSO SO. I JUST. NOW AFTER WE TALK ABOUT. EIGHT NINETEEN. THE EXPECTATIONS SHOULD BE YOUR PLAN AND YOU ACTUALLY GET ALL YOUR KIDS AND YOU SHOULD NOT BE PENALIZED FINANCIALLY FOR THAT MOST ACTUARIAL RATE SHOULD NOT BE ONE OR EXPECT THEM TO FALL OFF. ON THE FLIP SIDE IF THEY'RE NOT HITTING THAT. HE GET PAID FOR THAT EITHER RIGHT I MEAN THIS IS THIS IS WHAT THESE IS THAT THE LITTLE DIFFERENT THAT WELL YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A COLD. DID YOU BRING INTO THE ARE NOT OKAY. RIGHT WE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S REALLY COLD OR SOMETHING MORE SERIOUS I MEAN THERE'S A LOT. I GET THAT FOR THE MAD YOU KNOW THE MANAGED CARE PART OF IT BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PREVENTIVE SERVICES. THE STANDARDS PRETTY CLEAR RIGHT. SO THAT SO HOPEFULLY WE THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOME CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT WHEN IT COMES VERY SPECIFICALLY TO THIS TYPE OF SERVICE CORRECT. OKAY. RIGHT DID YOU AT SOME REAL BUT THAT THE CHAIR WOULD IT JUST I JUST- PERSON FOR SMALLER APOLOGIZE FOR MYTARDINESS BUT I'D I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE KIDS NOT GETTING THE CARE AT THE RIGHT TIME. IS POTENTIAL BIGGER EXPENSE ON THE OUT IT IT'S JUST WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT AND THAT'S AND I THINK TO ME THAT'S ONE MORE SHOCKING PARTS OF THIS IS LIKE WHOA WAIT A SECOND HERE IT'S A MISSED OPPORTUNITY. TO INTERVENE EARLY AND PROTECT THESE KIDS GOING FORWARD SO- I'D I HAVE BEEN HERE FOR ALL THIS OBVIOUSLY BUT I JUST THE I THINK THE NEXUS BETWEEN. BIGGER OUT THAT COSTS IN THE IN THE OUTLYING YEARS. AND THE MISSED OPPORTUNITY TAKE CARE OF KIDS- THERE OUGHT TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY ON BOTH. WITH THE PLANS AND WITH US FOR NOT MAKING IT HAPPEN. AND I THINK THE OTHER PART YOU KNOW WOULD WE AND I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT AND THEN DELVES MUCH INTO IS THAT MY GUESS IS THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PERCENTAGES THE PEOPLE AREN'T GETTING IT. YOU KNOW WHO ARE THEY- WHY ARE THEY NOT. YOU KNOW WE SEE THE DISPARITIES OF PEOPLE SPEAKING DIFFERENT LANGUAGES AND- AND SO FORTH SO YOU KNOW THAT'S- THAT AS WELL SO WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE- SET THAT LEVEL ACCOUNTABILITY AND BUT ALSO YOU KNOW ARE WE. HOW WE DESIGNED THE SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT MAY NOT NECESSARILY YOU KNOW YOU MENTIONED ACTUAR EARLY AND LEAVE ME I UNDERSTAND THAT WE NEED A LOT OF THINGS ACTUAR EARLY YEAH. BUT IN THE END SOMETHING LIKE THIS THIS IS THIS IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT PREVENTIVE SERVICES A LITTLE DIFFERENT. THAN SOME OF THE OTHER FORMS IN TERMS OF HOW YOU MIGHT WANT THINK ABOUT PAYMENT BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM GETTING THE SERVICES. AND YOUR REWARD PEOPLE FOR NOT PROVIDING THEM RIGHT AND SO- THERE'S A LITTLE LESS. I THINK UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHERE TO JUDGMENT FALLS. YES JUST FOLLOW UP AND THEN NOT JUST NECESSARY MEDICAL EXPENSES BUT YOU KNOW THAT FALLS INTO THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AND SCHOOLS TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH THESE KIDS WILL HAVE EITHER TO LASER THAT ANY HELP THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. EXCUSE MYSELF I HAVE ANOTHER MEETING BUT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY. TODAY OKAY. THANK YOU SO. FOUR TWO AND I APPRECIATE THAT- YOU PERSONALLY PRESENTED SEVERAL DIFFERENT THINGS THAT- THE DEPARTMENT IS DOING AND I THINK. THAT'S IMPORTANT MOVING FORWARD- I UNDERSTAND THE AUDITOR'S- YOU KNOW- CONCERNED ABOUT. THE CS SAYING THAT- IT. ONE RECOMMENDATION BUT ULTIMATELY IT'S REALLY ABOUT. HOW WE SURE THE KIDS GET THE CARE SO- I KNOW THERE ARE STE VARIOUS STEPS THAT YOU'VE DESCRIBED THAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO ACTUALLY INCREASE PROVIDER ENGAGEMENT. POSITION NUMBER SERVE OFTEN MEDI CAL WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT WE PRESS TRAPS AND RURAL COMMUNITIES WE STILL I MEAN. THIS TAX TOGETHER THESE WHERE WE MIGHT WANT TO WEAR THE I THINK WHAT THE HONOR REYES IS THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT SEEING YOU KNOW ARE THERE POCKETS THAT WE HAVE ISSUES WITH IN TERMS OF HAVING KNOWS IT FULLER WE JUST HEARD ABOUT FULL CAPACITY IT CETERA THAT MAYBE IS THAT WHAT'S STOPPING. GETS FROM GETTING THEIR- THEIR HOUSE A PROVISION VISITS AND WE NEED TO BUILD SOME PROVIDER CAPACITY THERE- RIGHT AND AGAIN WE DO HAVE EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT YOU POINTED OUT THAT CAN HELP US DO THAT BUT THAT MADE. PERHAPS MORE TARGET EFFORTS IN THAT REGARD. JUST GONNA THANK THE CHAIR- FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE DURING THE LAST BUDGET PROCESS OF. ANY ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR THE DEPARTMENT IN THIS AREA AS WELL THAT THAT'S NOT REALLY TOUCHED. ON HERE BUT THAT WAS A DIRECT OUTGROWTH OF BOTH THE AUDIT AND THE SUPPORT OF THE COMMITTEES AND LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR SO WE'LL BE PUTTING THOSE RESORT OBVIOUSLY. THE POSITIONS IS KIND OF PROVE THEM WE HAVE TO HIRE THEM AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT AGAIN THAT I THINK THAT WAS A- VERY COLLABORATIVE EFFORT ON TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROBLEM HAS THE APPROPRIATE RESOURCES TO. MAKE SURE MAKE THE CHANGES THAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING. WE WANT YOU TO BE SUCCESSFUL. WE DO TOO. BECAUSE AS YOU SAID. IT'S ABOUT CAN'T WELL YOU SAID YOU'RE NOT. YOU YOU'RE DOING THIS JOB BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE. A 100% SO WE WANT TO HELP YOU HELP PEOPLE. I MISS.

ALLIANCE FOR HEALTH CAN YOU HEAR ME OK GOOD OKAY US TO WORK COUNTY ORGANIZED HEALTH SYSTEM SERVING PEOPLE WITH MEDIC CAL IN SANTA CRUZ MONTEREY AND MERCED COUNTIES WE HAVE AROUND THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND MEMBERS 47% OF WHOM ARE CHILDREN. WE'VE BEEN OPERATING FOR ALMOST TWENTY FOUR YEARS AND- RECOGNIZING OUR TEN AND TWENTY YEAR ANNIVERSARY IS AND- MERCED AND MONTEREY COUNTIES THIS YEAR. OUR MISSION IS ACCESSIBLE QUALITY HEALTHCARE GUIDED BY LOCAL INNOVATION WE TAKE OUR COMMITMENT TO QUALITY SERIOUSLY AND HAVE DEMONSTRATED RESULTS IN ALL THREE COUNTIES IN WHICH WE SERVE. SANTA CRUZ IN MONTEREY COUNTY IS OUR PROVIDERS TYPICALLY PERFORM AT THE NINETIETH PERCENTILE ACROSS MOST OF THE PEDIATRIC EXTERNAL ACCOUNTABILITY SET MEASURES. AND IN MERCED COUNTY TWO OF THE FIVE MEASURES- THAT WE FOCUS ON FOR KIDS IN THE PAST HAVE BEEN AT THE NINETIETH PERCENTILE. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE WERE ABLE TO EXCEED THE MINIMUM PERFORMANCE LEVEL ACROSS THE BOARD. I'M SORRY TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THE ALLIANCE TOOK THE FINDINGS OF THE AUDITOR VERY SERIOUSLY AND I'VE TAKEN A NUMBER OF ACTIONS IN THE PAST YEAR TO IMPROVE THE DELIVERY OF PREVENTIVE SERVICES TO OUR KIDS. WHILE ALSO CONTINUING MANY EFFORTS THAT WERE ALREADY UNDER WAY TO ADVANCE PREVENTION OUR REGION. THE BARRIERS TO INCREASING THE- OF PREVENTIVE SERVICES. HAVE LARGELY TO DO WITH PROVIDER WORKFORCE PROVIDER AVAILABILITY IN CAPACITY. AS WELL AS MEMBER AWARENESS AND CONFIDENCE AND ACCESSING SERVICES WE ALSO SIGNED FIND SOME CHALLENGES WITH REGARDS TO DATA COLLECTION AND SHARING AS YOU'VE NOTED. WITH REGARDS TO THE NETWORK WE HAVE HISTORICALLY- ENHANCED PAYMENT FOR PEDIATRIC PREVENTIVE SERVICES PAYING SERVICE SCHEDULE FOR ALL C. H. T. P. SERVICES IN ADDITION TO CAPITATION TO PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. IN ADDITION WE HAVE OF FOCUS TO SOME OF OUR INCENTIVE PROGRAM MEASURES ON PEDIATRIC- MEASURES- OUR INCENTIVE PROGRAM AWARDS PERFORMANCE ABOVE THE FIFTIETH PERCENTILE AND SHARE SAVING BACK WITH PROVIDERS FOR THEIR PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION WE'VE PROVIDED ADDITIONAL TOOLS FOR OUR PROVIDERS TO IDENTIFY THOSE CHILDREN IN THEIR PRACTICES HAVE NOT RECEIVED IMMUNIZATIONS AND WHILE THE SETS WE'VE ALSO PROVIDED EDUCATIONAL OFFERINGS REGARDING PEDIATRIC SERVICES WE'VE INCLUDED PEDIATRIC PREVENTIVE SERVICES IN ALL OF OUR PROVIDER BULLETINS IN THIS PAST YEAR. AS WELL AS AN OLIVER PROVIDER WORKSHOPS AND ALSO IS THE FOCUS OF PRACTICE COACHING THAT WE DO WITH PRIMARY CARE PRACTICES. TO ADDRESS PEDIATRIC CAPACITY IN OUR REGION WE FOCUSED ON PEDIATRIC SERVICES IN OUR MEDIC CAPACITY GRANT PROGRAM THIS INCLUDED FUNDING FOR CAPITAL PLANNING FOR PEDIATRIC CLINIC EXPANSIONS THE RECRUITMENT OF EIGHTEEN PHYSICIANS TO OUR SERVICE AREA. GRANTS TO ORGANIZATIONS THAT ADDRESS FOOD AND SECURITY FOR SPECIFIC PEDIATRIC POPULATIONS AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT BETTER INTEGRATION OF CHILDREN'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. TO A MEMBER AWARENESS AND CONFIDENCE IN ACCESSING SERVICES WE'VE REVIEWED AND IMPROVED REMEMBER ON BOARDING PROCESS WE'VE PRIORITIZE MESSAGING REGARDING PREVENTIVE SERVICES DURING OUR COMMUNITY OUTREACH EVENTS. WE SPENT SENSE PACIFIC MAILERS TO MEMBERS REGARDING THE EPS D. T. BENEFIT. WE'VE ALSO SURVEYED OUR MEMBERS WITH REGARDS TO THEIR PERCEIVED BARRIERS AS TO IMMUNIZATION PROVIDED OUT REACH LETTERS O PARENTS OF CHILDREN WHO HAVE NOT HAD IMMUNIZATIONS ARE WELL VISITS. AND ARE ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF MAKING OUT REACH CALLS TO FAMILIES HAVE NOT HAVE IMMUNIZATIONS ARE WELL CHILD VISITS- I WOULD JUST CLOSE BY SAYING THAT. AS I MENTIONED BEFORE 40% OF OUR MEMBERS ARE CHILDREN AND- NO AMOUNT OF IMPROVEMENT THAT'S ENOUGH SO. REALLY PROP THE RESULTS THAT YOU THE CHEAP SO FAR AND WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON ADVANCING PREVENTION OUR AREA. THANK YOU THANKS FOR MUCH YESTERDAY. HELLO MY NAME'S MICHAEL DAY DIRECTOR OF HEALTH POLICY CHILDREN OUR NONPARTISAN POLICY RESEARCH AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION- I'D LIKE TO THINK THE COMMITTEES FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING AND ESPECIALLY KNOWLEDGE DOCTOR WOULD FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN SECURING THIS AUDIT- SO THE COMPANY HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION RE RELEASED A REPORT RECENTLY THAT SHOW THAT THINGS LIKE CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZATIONS AND AYE AYE CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN DECREASING BURSTING STAGNANT OVER THE LAST DECADE. AND SO CHILDREN ACCESS CARE MEDI CAL HAS BEEN A LONG STANDING PROBLEM THAT BENEFITS NEITHER KIDS NOR TAXPAYERS- BUT PERHAPS IN THE SYSTEM IS PRODUCING THE- THE OUTCOMES WAS DESIGNED TO SO WHEN HE TOOK OFFICE GOVERNOR NEWSOME INHERITED- MEDICAL MANAGED CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT WAS PLAYED AYE CONTRACTS THAT WERE NOT DESIGNED. TO IMPROVE QUALITY CARE FOR KIDS. AND. SUFFER FROM INCONSISTENT INEFFECTIVE CONTRACT OVERSIGHT AS THE AUDITOR'S REPORT SHOWED. SO IT'S UP MINISTRATION TO PROVIDE THE LEADERSHIP WE NEED TO TURN IT AROUND AND MAKE SURE THE KIDS ARE GETTING THEIR HE PST T. SERVICES. SO TO DO THIS THE ADMINISTRATION SHOULD UNDERTAKE MEDI CAL CONTRACT IN PAIN REFORMS NEXT YEAR THAT DEFINITIVELY PRIORITIZE. THE PST T. CARE FOR KIDS AND WE STAND READY TO SUPPORT THE STATE NETWORK. SO WITH THAT I WANTED TO- EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION FOR DCS STAFF IN ALL THEIR HARD WORK DRESSING AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS. AND I BRIEFLY ONCE WANTED TO TOUCH ON TWO OF THOSE ACTIVITIES. ONE WAS AROUND HE NOTICED. CONSUMER IS THAT DE CSS. REALLY APPRECIATE THEIR WILLINGNESS TO WORKS COLLABORATIVELY WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE SURE THAT- THE FINAL NOTICE IS DONE EFFECTIVELY IN AN UNDERSTANDABLE AND RESPECTFUL WAY TO PARENTS WE HAVE A COUPLE EXAMPLES ONE IS FROM SMALL CALIFORNIA ON THE MEDICAL DENTAL BENEFITS THE OTHER ONE IS A COLORFUL FAMILY FRIENDLY PAMPHLET THAT THE WISCONSIN MEDICAID AGENCY PUT OUT SO IF THE MODELS OF WAYS TO DO THIS WELL. NEXT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE- REPORT THAT TEACHES IS WORKING ON AROUND THE BRIGHT FUTURES PREVENTIVE SERVICES. WE KNOW THEY'RE WORKING ON AND WE URGE YOU TO WE URGE THE DEPARTMENT TO RELEASE THIS REPORT- SOONER GIVEN THE PERSISTENT REQUEST FROM- STAKEHOLDERS IN ADVISORY PANEL MEMBERS SO WE HOPE THAT WE CAN GET A PRELIMINARY DRAFT OF THAT REPORT BY THE END OF THIS YEAR TO MAKE IT TO CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION. AND WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF WE'RE GOING TO ESTABLISH FUTURE PERFORMANCE MEASURES- WE IT THROUGH MANY MEDI CAL CONTRACTS AND PAYMENTS WE WANT THAT WANT THAT TO BE DONE HOLISTICALLY KID FOCUSING AND OUTCOMES BASED WAY THAT REALLY LEVERAGES THE MANAGED CARE BUSINESS MODEL. SO TO BE CLEAR THE STATION ESTABLISH AND ENFORCE CONTRACTS THAT ALIGN THE ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES WITH FINANCIAL AND OTHER INCENTIVES TO REALLY DRIVE IMPROVEMENT AND WOULD PROMOTE DISPARITIES REDUCTIONS FOR CHILDREN- ONE IDEA IS THE STATE COULD CONSIDERING THE RATE SETTING METHODOLOGY THAT REQUIRES A MINIMUM SPENDING LEVEL ON PRIMARY CARE SERVICES FOR CHILDREN. IT IS AND APPROACH ORGAN AND RHODE ISLAND HAVE TAKEN SO CALIFORNIA COULD SIMILARLY EXPLORE SUCH A THING. SO IN CLOSING I'LL JUST OFFER THAT MANAGED CARE PROCUREMENT PROCESS NEXT YEAR REALLY REPRESENTS AND- REAL OPPORTUNITY TO RECTIFY THE ACCESS ISSUES IDENTIFIED IN THE I DIDN'T TO MAKE A POSITIVE AND LASTING IMPRINT ON THE WAY THE STATE PAYS FOR DELIVERS. SERVICES FOR KIDS AND MEDI CAL THANK. YOU PERFECT HAPPINESS REHEARSED THANK YOU. PRACTICAL EXCUSE ME THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE MY NAME IS SHOCKED COR VOCAL I'M A PEDIATRICIAN AND PRACTICING PEDIATRICIAN AND CO CHAIR FOR THE STATE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS IN CALIFORNIA WHERE NONPROFIT REPRESENTING ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND PEDIATRICIANS HERE IN CALIFORNIA- AND THE IS THANK YOU TO DOCTOR WOULD DOCTOR PAN DISTINGUISHED- COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR HAVING US HERE AND SPEAKING ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. WE AS PEDIATRICIANS ARE- ALARMED CONCERNED DISMAYED THAT THAT- THAT PREVENTIVE SCREENING IN CALIFORNIA IS SO LOW FOR CHILDREN WE- AND I HOPE AND THAT THAT EVERYONE HERE CAN FEEL LITTLE BIT LIKE A PEDIATRICIAN TODAY IN THE SENSE THAT WE'RE ALL A BIT OBSESSED AND IT'S IN MANY WAYS A THANKLESS JOB AND THAT YOU KNOW WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU DIDN'T GET TETANUS- YOU KNOW ONCE LAST TIME YOU DIDN'T GET LEAD POISONING- BUT- BEING AT PEACE. WHERE A LITTLE BIT INFORMED BY A AS THE TRUMP TO BE HONEST. IF YOU CENA MOM LOSE A CHILD. ON THE WAY HERE I'M A GROWN MAN BUT- I ACTUALLY STARTED CRYING A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE I'VE SEEN SEVERAL MOM LOSE LOSE BABY TO YOU KNOW WE CALL IT SUFFOCATION NOW BUT SUCH SUDDEN INFANT DEATH. AND IT'S TOTALLY WELL NOT TOTALLY THERE'S LITTLE BEEN UNKNOWN BUT LARGELY PREVENTABLE. SO YOU KNOW JUST THE BACK TO SLEEP CAMPAIGN SAVES TWO THOUSAND LIVES IN THIS COUNTRY A YEAR. AND DON'T HAVE. WE NEVER KNOW AT THE END WINS LAST TIME YOU. DIDN'T DIE- SYSTEM SOLELY IMMENSELY IMPORTANT AND I SHOULD I SHOULD THINK THE DEPARTMENT I SHOULD THANK EVERYONE WHO'S HERE TODAY BECAUSE- WHAT YOU DO WILL SAVE FIVE. AND I'M IMMENSELY THANKFUL AND I HOPE YOU FEEL LITTLE OF THAT OBSESSION TO DO FOR OTHER PEOPLE THAT YOU'LL NEVER MEET AND THEY'LL NEVER KNOW- THAT YOU HELP THEM. AND THANK YOU AND I I'LL SWITCH IT SHOULD THANK MICHAEL DAY AND ALL OF OUR PARTNERS- FOR THE IMPORTANT WORK YOU'RE DOING IN- HOPING PEDIATRICIANS DO A WE DO AND HELPING- CHILDREN OF ACHIEVERS SUFFICIENCY OF OPPORTUNITY. HEALTH AND PREVENTION OF CONDITIONS LIKE DIABETES- YOU KNOW INTERVENTION FOR EARLY INTERVENTION FOR DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS ALL THE ALL THE THINGS THAT THAT. CHILDREN REALLY NEED TO THRIVE IN AND- AND BECOME WHAT THEY THEY'RE DESTINED TO BE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU QUESTIONS. THANK THANK YOU- COUPLE- RESPOND I MAKERS TO HEAR THE IMPROVEMENTS AND IN YOUR IN YOUR PROGRAM- IS THE CENTRAL CENTRAL CALIFORNIA WINES FOR HEALTH INSURANCE BIG MOUTHFUL- BUT- HOW HOW HAVE YOU REACHED OUT TO PROVIDERS AND- AND- BENEFICIARIES. AND WHAT WHAT STRATEGIES IF YOU EMPLOYED AND. SOMEWHAT TARGETED OKAY THINKING WE'VE BEEN- IT'S BEEN VERY BROAD THIS YEAR IN TERMS OF THE VOLUME OF COMMUNICATION SO AS I MENTIONED WE FOCUSED ON PREVENTIVE MEASURES IN EACH OF OUR THEIR BULLETINS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS WE SEND A BILL IT'S NOT TO THE ENTIRE NETWORK- WE REALLY EMPHASIZED EFFORTS IN MERCED COUNTY WHERE WE HAVE THE LOWEST RATES OF PERFORMANCE AND SO WHEN I TALK ABOUT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WORKSHOPS WITH THE PROVIDERS WE HAVE A QUALITY IMPROVEMENT TEAM THAT GOES OUT IN. PRACTICE CATCHING. THAT INCLUDES PROVIDING. WORK HARD TO THOSE PRIME. IS THE LET'S THE PRACTICE KNOW WHERE THEY'RE FALLING IN TERMS OF THEIR MEMBERS ARE NOT RECEIVING SERVICES AND THEN TALKING THEM THROUGH WHAT OPPORTUNITIES THEY MIGHT HAVE WITHIN THEIR OFFICES TO HELP IMPROVE PERFORMANCE IN THOSE AREAS AND THEN WE'VE HEARD THAT WITH MEMBER COMMUNICATIONS AS WELL. SO HAVE YOU RECEIVED ANY GUIDANCE. DH CS THREE JUST TO CERTAINLY THEY'VE ISSUED A P. L.'S THIS YEAR AND THIS IS BEEN A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION AT EACH OF THE CEO MEETINGS THAT EACH CSCO MEETINGS FOR THE HEALTH PLANS AND SO THIS IS BEEN PRETTY ACTIVE IN TERMS OF THE DIALOGUE I THINK INITIALLY- AS WAS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY YOU KNOW UNDERNEATH SOME CERTAINLY CAME OUT VERY STRONG AND EMPHASIZING PREVENTION FOR KIDS WHICH IS SOMETHING WE WERE EXCITED TO SEE IF THE HEALTH PLAN. IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN TALKING A CARDBOARD OVER THE PAST YEAR MANY OF THE HEALTH PLAN HAD FOCUS ON COMPLEX ADULTS AND RIGHTFULLY SO WITH THE ACA EXPANSION IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE REALLY LOOK AT WHAT'S NEED TO CHANGE AND IT'S THIS ISSUE IT'S WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF PREVENTION FOR KIDS RIGHT. WHERE WE FOCUSED AND LINE. PRESS THAT. WANT TO BE GOING. AND SO WE HAVE A- THAT THE FEET THAT WE'VE- BEEN UP. AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT. LOCAL PROVIDER STUDENTS CARE. THANK YOU. MISTER DAY YOU MENTIONED- WANTING TO SEE HOPEFULLY A DRAFT- BY THE END OF THE YEAR- NOT FAMILIAR WITH WHAT THE ACTUAL TIME LINE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ON THAT. WHAT IS THE TIME AND IS THAT POSSIBLE. YEAH WELL THAT THAT'S A POSSIBILITY THAT THAT DROPPED MY EMAIL HERE. SO THE TIME LINE THAT WE HAD INDICATED IN THE AUTO RESPONSE WOULD BE TWENTY TWENTY- AND A LARGE PART OF THAT QUITE HONESTLY IS SO THAT WE CAN WORK WITH MIKE AND OTHERS ON MAKING SURE THAT WHAT'S GOING TO BE IN THAT REPORT HAS THE MEASURES. AND THE METRICS OF THE METHODOLOGY OF HOW YOU DO THAT SO THAT THAT IS WHAT OUR INTENTION ANTI MY IS EIGHT A CERTAINLY CAN TAKE BACK WITH THE TEAM AND THINKING ABOUT. IS THERE SOME. IS THERE SOME DRAFT WHAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THAT THEN COULD. ON THAT I JUST YOU KNOW WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S MEANINGFUL AND SO WE OFTEN FIND THAT'S MOST USEFUL WHEN WE WHEN WE WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS AND- YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THAT ALSO IS RELATED JUST OUR OVERALL CAPACITY. OF A DEPARTMENT OF THE THINGS THAT WERE WORKING ON AND I THINK AS AS YOU KNOW THE CALIBER PROPOSAL THAT WE RECENT RELEASED HAT HAS TAKEN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR TIME AND SO. NO THESE ARE ALL HIGH PRIORITY. TIMES. ONCE THAT CAN TAKE THAT BACK THE TEAM IN AND CHECK IN WITH MIKE ON. ON HOW CAN WE THINK ABOUT AN INTERDEPENDENT EACH MEANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. IT'S CLEAR WE ARE WORKING ON THESE THINGS AND HOW DO WE DO THAT IN A WAY THAT'S AS TIMELY AS POSSIBLE AND MAKING SURE WE'RE GETTING THAT. MEANT SO WE CAN TAKE THAT BACK AND- FOLLOW BACK UP WITH HIM SO TWELVE TWENTY SIX. THAT'S A BIG BROAD. IT IS- SOMETIME IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE DON'T HAVE THAT OFF THE TOP OF. BUT I WILL ABSOLUTELY COMMIT TO GETTING BACK. ON THAT AND THEN HOW WE CAN POTENTIALLY MOVE THAT UP FOR WHAT. IT COULD BE EARLY I DON'T ACTUALLY JUST KNOW THAT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. AND BROUGH- FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE. IN YOUR MEMBER AND TENURE PROVIDERS HOW'S THE OUT REACH BEEN AND HOW IT'S BEING RECEIVED BY PROVIDERS. IT'S INCONSISTENT SO WE REACHED OUT TO OUR LEADERSHIP AND SOME HAVE HEARD FROM THEIR HEALTH PLAN SOME HAVE NOT THERE THE KEY. IS FOR OUTREACH AND FEEDBACK FROM FROM THE HEALTH PLAN- TORY- YOU KNOW CAPABILITIES WITHIN THE MEDICAL GROUPS TO. TRACK AND GET OUT TO MEMBERS IS VARIABLE SO. THERE'S A LOT OF. DIFFUSION OF RESPONSIBILITY I GUESS BETWEEN BETWEEN ALL THE PARTY SCENE WITH A SELF PLAN THE STATE IN THE AND PROVIDERS I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A MORE COHESIVE PLAN. ARE THERE SOME AREAS OF THE STATE THAT ARE DOING BETTER IN THAT COMMUNICATION ANOTHER- ARE HARD TO SAY IN OUR IN OUR IN OUR SURVEY IT'S IT. IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A SPECIFIC PATTERN. WHAT DO YOU THINK INCREASES PREVENTIVE SERVICES IN YOUR VIEW WHAT WHAT IS WHAT IS WHAT IS THE- I'M NOT LOOKING FOR A MAGIC BULLET. BUT I AM KIND. YEAH BECAUSE WHAT IS IT THAT WHAT IS IT THAT INCREASES ACCESS TO PREVENTIVE SERVICES. I THINK IT'S A EMINENCE SYSTEMS RIGHT SO- YOU KNOW I THINK HIM IMPROVE REIMBURSEMENT- FOR AREAS WITH WITH LOW PROVIDER- RATIOS YOU KNOW AND I THINK THERE'S OTHER STATES THAT HAVE SHOWED. INTENDED BASED PAYMENTS TO BE EFFECTIVE IN INCREASING- THE AVAILABILITY- I THINK THERE'S A LOT WE CAN DO AS FAR AS DATA IN IN IMPROVING HOW WE DISSEMINATE AND TRACK DATA. IN INFRASTRUCTURE YEAH SO THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS AND I THINK OF OUR PARTNERS AND THE AUDIT REPORT ITSELF OF HAVE MADE A LOT OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE GOOD. GOOD WAY TO GO. I CAN. THANK YOU- JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT. AND DAY APPRECIATE THE VARIOUS EFFORTS- FROM FROM YOUR PLAN AND OTHER PLANS TO TRY TO AND IN THE STATE BUT HOW ARE WE DOING TO- A AS I MENTIONED IT'S THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PATIENT OR FAMILY WITH THEIR PHYSICIAN THAT OFTEN IS THE MOST AFFECTED IN TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO SHOP FOR VISITS AND SO FORTH. WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO BUILD CAPACITY AND PRACTICES TO DO THIS I THINK THERE'S TWO AREAS I WANTED PARTICULARLY TOUCH ON ONE IS THAT HOW LONG DOES COULD- RELATIONSHIPS ARE ALSO ABOUT TOP SELLERS IF YOU HAVE A LOT TURN OVER. THE PROVIDERS STAND PEOPLE ARE DEVELOPING ONGOING RELATIONSHIPS YOU KNOW THEY WERE CAUGHT YELLED AND FAMILY GETS BOUNCED AROUND DIFFERENT PLACE ALSO BY WAY BECOMES A CHALLENGE TERMS OF DATA TRACKING TO- GAIN ACCURATE DATA SO WE'LL BE LOOKING AT- SOME THE LONGEVITY OF HOW LONG PARTICULAR FIRES ARE IN NETWORKS- AND HOW THAT TIES TO- PERFORMANCE. AND IN THE OTHER PART IS THAT THESE ARE PRACTICING ARCHER SO. IT'S YOU KNOW A REMINDER SYSTEMS AND THINGS LIKE THAT- PAGE REALIZING THAT YOU USE THAT SOMEONE NEEDS TO DO THAT COSTS MONEY THAT TAKES UP THE THAT THAT SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE THAT. AS OUR ENTERED TO HAVE THEIR SOME FUNDING THAT ALLOWS THEM TO DO THAT WHETHER IT'S YEAH REMINDER SYSTEM OUR NURSE COORDINATOR WHO CAN HELP OUT WITH THESE TYPE OF THING AND THEN ALSO THE FOLLOW THROUGH BY THE WAY YOU COME IN FOR WELL CHILD. YOU DO THE SCREENING AND SOMETHING COMES BACK POSITIVE. AND SO STONE'S HELP YOU TRY TO CONNECT UP WITH THE ALL THE REGIONAL CENTER FOR EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES IT'S WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT SPECIAL EDUCATION RIGHT. IT'S OF THE AUDIOLOGIST FOR THE HEARING SCREENING IT'S WITH YOU KNOW SPECIALIST THAT THERE'S WHATEVER SO THAT THE P. S. IT'S THE- THE- T. T. AT THE END. OKAY ALL. RIGHT SO IT'S NOT SCREENING IT'S THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT. AND SO THE T. PART AT THE END. SO WHAT ARE WE DOING IN THAT RATE- TO TRY TO PROVIDE THE TO BUILD THAT CAPACITY IN IN AND THE AMONG THE- PHYSICIANS AND OTHER PROVIDERS SO I THINK THAT'S BOTH KIND OF A. QUESTION FOR. THE CS BUT ALSO QUESTION FOR THE PLANS- CONTRACTING WHO ARE HAVING TO DIRECT CONTRACTS WITH THE POSITIONS ON PROVIDERS. TWO AGO SERVER. SO AS I MENTIONED BEFORE JUST WITH REGARDS TO THE PREVENTIVE SERVICES THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE DONE- FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS NOW JUST IN TERMS OF PROVIDING FEE FOR SERVICE REIMBURSEMENT FOR WHAT WE PREVIOUSLY FOCUSED ON A C. H. T. P. WHICH CURRENTLY THE- THE BRIGHT FUTURE SUITE OF SERVICES NOW FOR MEMBERS JUST TO BE. SURE THAT OUR PROVIDERS ARE ARE KNOWING THAT WERE PUTTING AN EMPHASIS ON THIS FOR FAMILIES AND FOR ITS- WE ALSO INCLUDE THOSE MEASURES IN OUR INCENTIVE PROGRAM. THAT MEASURES PERFORMANCE WITH LIKE PROVIDERS OR PEDIATRICIAN. IN OTHER COMPETING WITH THEIR PEERS AND THAT'S MOTIVATING TO PEOPLE. THAT WITH QUARTERLY REPORT CARDS TO THE PROVIDERS AND I'VE GONE TO LEVEL THIS YEAR REALLY PEDIATRIC FOCUS REPORT CARDS AND THEN FOR THOSE PRACTICES THAT SEEM TO BE STRUGGLING GOING IN AND HAVING OUR Q. I STAFF WORK WITH THEM ON A PSA PROCESS. THINK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE OFFICE THAT COULD BE SHIFTED. THE PROVIDER BETTER- AND BETTER OUTCOME- WE ARE ALSO AS I MENTIONED- PROVIDING PROVIDER EQUIPMENT GRANTS TO RECRUIT NEW PROVIDERS TO THE AREA WE ALSO HAVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS AVAILABLE SO FOR PRACTICE WANTED TO BRING IN A NEW SOFTWARE SYSTEM. IF THEY WANTED TO HAVE SOME TYPE OF- PRACTICE ASSESSMENT AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY COULD DO DIFFERENTLY. THERE'S ALSO THAT RESOURCE AVAILABLE TO THEM- ONE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD MENTION IS WE BEEN. HAVING DIFFERENTKINDS OF CONVERSATIONS WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE THERE YEAH WE'RE LUCKY IN OUR THREE COUNTIES BECAUSE THERE ARE. FORUMS WERE ALL HEALTH CARE LEADER. EARLIER BEFORE WE BASIS IN SOME INSTANCES WHERE THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS MIGHT BE PRESENT AND DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS IN THE COUNTY SO THAT WE CAN START TALKING WITH OTHERS WHO ARE ALSO PROVIDERS OF SERVICE TO CHILDREN. TO THINK ABOUT HOW CAN WE WORK IN A MORE INTEGRATED WAY ACROSS ALL THE SYSTEM- IF THE FAMILIES ARE GETTING THE SAME MESSAGES IN THE SCHOOLS AND ANOTHER SERVICE AS AS THEY ARE FROM PLANT. FROM THE WRITERS HELPS THE PROVIDERS OUT IT CAN'T JUST BE THE PHYSICIAN'S JOB TO BE THE ONE POINT OF CONTACT WITH THE FAMILY. OBSERVER REPAIR LOOKING AT WHAT OFFER TO DO WE HAVE TO BETTER INTEGRATE COMMUNICATE ACROSS THE SYSTEM. ADD ON TO THINK THERE. ARE A FEW THINGS I THINK ONE. THAT I'VE- IT'S POSSIBLE THE TEAM HAS DONE THAT I IT. NOT AWARE OF IS REALLY LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE OF. OUR OUR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES STAYING WITH THE SAME PROVIDER. OVER TIME. IS THERE A WAY TO REALLY LOOK AT SOME OF THE INCENTIVE CONCEPTS AGAIN THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED THROUGH CALLIE AIM. TO REALLY REINFORCE THAT WE'VE DONE THAT ON THE DENTAL SIDE I THINK. HAVEN'T DONE IT AS SPECIFICALLY ON ON ON THE PHYSICAL HEALTH SIDE I DO KNOW. OBVIOUSLY OUR PLANS DO THEIR OWN INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND THAT'S WHERE. SHARING THEIR BEST PRACTICES ABOUT HOW DO WE MAKE SURE FOLKS. WE HAVE A HOME. AND NOT SORT OF GOING AROUND. AT YOUR POINT. DOES IMPROVE JUST THE DATA COLLECTION AND THE TRACKING OF WHAT SERVICES ARE BEING PROVIDED IN WHO'S DOING THE REFERRALS. I'D ALSO- POINT TO SOME OF THE CONCEPTS IN CALLIE ABOUT. REALLY PUTTING EVEN MORE EMPHASIS. ON HEALTH PLAN BUT NOT NOT REALLY THE HEALTH PLAN. SERVICE IT'S BUT SORT. LOW A LOT. OF CARE BOARD. OWNERS THE OTHER AND THEN AGAIN SOME OF THOSE OTHER SOCIAL SERVICES YOU KNOW WHO ARE THE FOUR OR THE FOOD INSECURE OR THEIR HOUSING ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO BE. ADDRESSING AND SO THAT'S REALLY A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IN OUR IN OUR CALLIE MORE TO. TO REALLY HAVE THAT BE A FOCAL POINT AND NOT HAVE SOMEONE WHO'S HAVING TO CALL SIX DIFFERENT. PLACES BECAUSE THEY'RE SIX DIFFERENT CARE COORDINATORS TO DO THAT- ON THE FOLLOW THROUGH. PEACE I THINK AND SUPERCRITICAL FIRST FROM A PRODUCTIVE IN UTILIZING DATA ANALYTICS ABOUT WE SEE A SCREENING HAPPEN. WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT AND YOU KNOW WE'VE PARTICULARLY WITH THE TRAUMA SCREENINGS YOU KNOW THING THAT'S GOING TO GO INTO PLACE IN JANUARY WE REALLY WORKED WITH THE SURGEON GENERAL ON- DIFFERENTIATING LIKE. SOMEONE YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY SPLITTING THE CODE INTO TWO SO ONE THAT'S MAYBE LOWER RISK- AND THEN WHERE ARE THE HIGHER RISK WHERE THERE SHOULD BE REFERRALS. THE TEN FOR MENTAL SERVICES BUT ALSO IN A FINE WHAT TYPES OF PHYSICAL HEALTH PROVIDERS CAN REALLY PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES IN A TRAUMA INFORMED WAY- THE CHALLENGES OF GOING TO. A PHYSICIAN WHEN YOU'VE EXPERIENCED TRAUMA IS SIGNIFICANT AND- AND SCARY AND SO A LOT OF TIMES YOU SEE THAT SORT OF THE UNWILLINGNESS OF WANTING TO GO INTO THAT OFFICE BECAUSE OF FEAR AND SO HOW DO WE REALLY TRACK THOSE AND- REALLY THOSE ARE THE THINGS WE'RE LOOKING AT PARTICULARLY ALSO WITH THE DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS OF. OF GREETING HAPPEN. NOW IT'S GOING. WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THE MANAGED CARE PLAN TO BE PROVIDING THAT FOLLOW UP SERVICE BUT IT IS THEIR RESPONSIBILITY. AND AGAIN THAT SORT OF MORE PROVIDER BASED ON THE GROUND PERSON TO PROVIDE THE APPROPRIATE REFERRAL AND THEN MAKING SURE WE'RE CONNECTING THAT DATA. REFERRAL HAPPENED MAYBE DID IF THAT DIDN'T THAT'S A PROBLEM IF THE FOR ALL HAPPENED NOTHING HAPPENED FROM THAT REFERRAL HOW DO WE ALSO ADDRESS THAT SO I THINK. A LOT OF THOSE THINGS ARE ARE ARE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK AT AND THE DATA IT IMPORTANT IN BEING ABLE TO ASSESS THAT. I WOULD ALSO SAY ALTHOUGH IT HADN'T BEEN A PARTICULAR. PIECE THAT YOU HEARD ME MENTION ON THE OUTREACH SIDE. BUT HOW DO WE NOT JUST HAVE THE PLAN TO BE DOING OUTREACH BUT HOW PUSH THAT DEBT TO THE PROVIDER LEVEL MAKING SURE THEY HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT MADE THAT MAY NEED TO REACH. OUT AND I SAVE. THE SORT OF WHEN YOU. IN MY LOOK. WHY IS THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE WITH. ACCURATE CAUGHT HIM FOR MISSION FOR FAMILIES AND MEDI CAL AND- KNOWING THAT THE PROVIDER LEVEL TYPICALLY HAS THE BEST PLANS HAVE THE NEXT BEST. BUT IT'S NOT OFTEN CONSISTENT AND NOT OFTEN EASILY SHARED BECAUSE OF OUR DATA SYSTEM LIMITATIONS AND- REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH FOLKS ON. HOW DO WE OBVIOUSLY MAINTAIN THE PRIVACY THAT NEEDS TO BE MAINTAINED. BUT MAKE SURE THAT OUR HEALTH PLANS ARE PROVIDERS ARE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FOLKS ALL HAVE THE INFORMATION ON HOW TO ACTUALLY REACH. BENEFIT WHETHER. WHAT I'M OUT HERE FOR KIDS BUT EVEN ADULTS WE CAN'T IF WE DON'T IF THEY CAN'T BE LOCATED BECAUSE OUR DATA JUST ISN'T BEING UPDATED APPROPRIATELY THAT'S A HUGE PROBLEM AND SO. I WOULD SAY AGAIN THAT'S ANOTHER AREA WHERE I THINK IF WE CAN IMPROVE THAT AND FIND A MORE STREAMLINED WAY TO DO THAT. IT WILL HELP IMPROVE SERVE THESE WERE ALL RESULTS OF YES MAYBE ONE THING HAPPENS BUT THE FOLLOW THROUGH DOESN'T. THANK YOU ARE. YOU JUST TOUCH ON ISSUES RUN HOMELESSNESS ARE PEOPLE OF UNSTABLE HOUSING EXACTLY ADDRESSES THINGS LIKE THAT- I APPRECIATE THAT- YOU- THAT- THE SUNSHINE TALKED ABOUT THE IDEA ABOUT ACTUALLY EVEN PAYING FEE FOR SERVICE FOR. PREVENTION THAT GOES BACK TO YOU KNOW THIS IS ONE OF THESE THINGS THAT WELL EITHER YOU'RE ON THE SCHEDULE IT'S NOT THAT I'M GONNA SEE EXTRA VISITS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PROVE THAT BUT YOU KNOW THERE YOUR- PEOPLE KNOW THAT IF I GET THAT I'VE SEEN PATIENT ON THE SCHEDULE I'M GOING TO GET PAID- AND THAT. THAT COMES REPORT I APPRECIATE ALSO WE SAID ABOUT CONTINUITY- GIVE YOU THE WORK ON PRIMARY CARE BY OUR FEELS WORK AND WHAT MAKES PRIMARY CARE HIGHER. QUALITY LOWER COST ETCETERA IT'S ACTUALLY ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP. SO WHEN PEOPLE JUST. CHURNING THROUGH- PHYSICIANS OTHER PROVIDERS THAT ACTUALLY YOU THE BENEFITS. OF THAT SO IT'S BEING OF THE BUILD THAT RELATIONSHIP- SO I THINK. CERTAINLY AND WE NEED TO DO MUCH BETTER AND MAKE NOTE THAT IOWA. THAT THEIR NUMBER ONE HERE BUT DAY PERFORM BETTER THAN OUR BEST PERFORMANCE. FOR ANY YEAR. PERCENT IT'S 49% NATIONAL AVERAGE IS 50% THAT'S THE AVERAGE WE CAN DO BETTER AVERAGE AND I THINK IF WE WANT TO CARRY OUT THE GOVERNOR'S VISION THEN WE NEED TO KNOW YOU. BETTER THAN AVERAGE SO I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING MORE SPECIFICS ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO GO ABOUT DOING THIS- BEFORE I LET YOU ALL GO I DO WANT TO RAISE AN ISSUE- SPECIALLY. SINCE CHAIR WAS HAVE BEEN HAVING TO DEAL WITH THIS- BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IT DOES INTERFACE WITH THESE TWO OUT REPORTS TO. WHAT ARE WE DOING TO BE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO CARE WHEN WE HAVE THE POWER GOING OUT WE HAVE FIRES GOING ON. OUT TO BE RECENTLY READ ARTICLE ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THIS IS FACING FOR PRACTICES. OF CAN YOU PERHAPS THE JUST COULD SPEAK A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT'S YOUR INTERACTION WITH WHETHER IT'S WITH ELLIE S. OR OTHER AGENCIES TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE CONTINUE TO GET ACCESS TO CARE. WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW THERE'S A FIRE PEOPLE OUT THE BACK TO IT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT POWERS GOING OUT PEOPLE STILL CATION THERE'S NO REFRIGERATION HOSPITALS RUN ON GENERATORS FOR DAYS ON END WHEN THOSE GENERATORS ARE DESIGNED AROUND FOR THAT LONG. BOB OR MEDI CAL CAN YOU JUST PERHAPS TOUCH ON SOME OF THE THINGS DH CS IS DOING AND WE'RE HEARING FROM BG AND HE'S CEO THAT IS A TEN YEAR NORMAL OR ABNORMAL SO THIS IS NOT SO WHERE THINGS THAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT FOR MEDI CAL POPULATION IN THESE COMMUNITIES. SO I CAN IS TOP. LEVEL NUMBER MERRY CHIME IN LEBANON FROM THE SPECIFIC STUFF SO- AT THE AGENCY LEVEL THEY DO THEY ARE AT THE ARE AT THE JOINT OPERATION CENTER- WITH ALL THE OTHER WITH ALL THE OTHER MAJOR AGENCIES- THE LEADS WITH AND- HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY- ARE PRIMARILY DSS BECAUSE THEY DO LOTS OF. HOUSING SUPPORT ACTIVITIES- EMSA WORKS ON MEDICAL CAPACITY- AND THEN- PUBLIC HEALTH- BECAUSE THE LICENSING CERTIFICATION AREA THAT THAT THEY WORK IN AN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH. SO THE. THREE LEADS WE ARE REPORT. TO THE. HE JUST. HAD A BREAK IN A VERY HIGH LEVEL- DURING THE MOST RECENT- INCIDENT WE'RE HAVING CALLS AT LEAST TWICE A DAY- AT AGE TO LEVEL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE THAT WE WERE COORDINATED. THEIR PARTICULAR AREAS AND AGAIN AMERICAN TITLE BUT MORE THIS BUT THEY WERE THERE- THINGS THAT WERE BEING RAISED UP IN TERMS OF THE NEED FOR MEDICATIONS WHICH PHARMACIES OR OPEN WHICH PROMISES ONE OPEN- NEED FOR REFRIGERATION- IN A NUMBER OF CASES WE HAVE- PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE THAT. ARE YOU KNOW WE'RE PRO AM SAID LIKE PRESENT TENSE AND VENTILATORS OR C. PAP OR KINDS OF MACHINES THAT ARE TO KEEP BY. THAT WE ARE CONSTANTLY CHECK IN ON- WHAT CAME. OUT OF THE MOST RECENT INCIDENT AGAIN AT A HIGH LEVEL WAS THAT. NEEDED TO GET SOME SENSE RIGHT WHERE FORMER DRUMMER FOR EXAMPLE- AND SO- THE ADMINISTRATION. ASSET APARTMENTS HEALTH CARE TO ESTABLISH A SPECIAL HOTLINE. THAT WE THEN MADE AVAILABLE YOU KNOW TO THE PUBLIC AND TO OUR AND TO THE HEALTH PLANS- FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO CALL AND IDENTIFY SPECIFIC NEEDS OF THE MAKE OF AND HIS TEAMMATES C. REGULATES MOST OF THE PLANS RIGHT NOW BUT THEY HAVE. A CALL CENTER THERE BUT KNOWS WHEN AND RATE THE H. WILL HELP THE KIND OF THING. SO WE- WHAT WE COULD DO TO LEAN FORWARD USING THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT WE HAVE. TO SET UP. A HOTLINE FOR AND. TO BE A CALL AND THEN WE WORKED WITH THE AGENCY- ON VERY SPECIFIC- DIRECTION TO THE PLANS. ABOUT WHAT THEY WERE TO DO I'M REALLY TO MEDICATIONS ALL IT MAY TALK ABOUT THAT PROCESS. I FEEL LIKE A COVERED A LOT OF IT BUT- I THINK I GOT A FEW VERY SPECIFIC THINGS OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE GREAT PLAN PARTNERS TO GET WHO CARE VERY MUCH ABOUT THEIR POPULATIONS AND SO. WHAT WE SAW AND WHAT OUR DIRECTION WAS IS PARTICULARLY ON THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG SIDE- YOU KNOW PEOPLE MIGHT NOT HAVE THEIR SCRIPT THE MIGHT HAVE LEFT IT AT YOU KNOW WHATEVER IT IS. OPENING UP AND NOT HAVING TO TREAT. THE REQUIREMENTS SO THAT PEOPLE COULD HAVE BOTH EMERGENCY SUPPLIES BUT IF. IF IT'S NEEDED LONGER TO DO THAT WE OBVIOUSLY RECOGNIZE IF YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS. AND YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE YOUR MEDICATION. WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IS YOU KNOW COULD BE. ULTIMATELY DYING AND PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU THINK OF SOME OF YOU KNOW THE MORE CHALLENGING THE CHALLENGING POPULATIONS WE DO DO DALY FACILITY CHECK IN SO ANY OF THE FACILITIES IN THE AREA WHETHER HOSPITALS. OTHER LONG TERM INSTITUTIONAL OTHER TYPES OF THOSE THINGS WE DO CHECK IN WITH THOSE IF THAT WAS HAVING TO TRANSFER PATIENTS WE ASSISTING AGAIN WHETHER IT'S WITH HEALTH PLAN OR SPONSOR. YOUR OR IN FEE FOR SERVICE WE DO HAVE A PROCESS THAT TO REALLY HELP PEOPLE TRANSITION. I THINK WE HAVE YOU KNOW. UNFORTUNATELY BUT IN THE CASE OF NOW HAVING LEARNED FROM THE FIRES IN A COUPLE OF YEARS REALLY THINKING ABOUT HOW TO WORK WITH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE. THE ABILITY. NOT ONLY FOR US AS A STATE TO PROVIDE SERVICE THAT AT THE STATE BECAUSE- WE CAN GET FEDERAL FUNDING FOR WHEN SERVICES MIGHT NEED TO BE PROVIDED AN ALTERNATIVE LOCATIONS AND- CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM ON ON THOSE ISSUES- YOU KNOW WHETHER THERE ARE THINGS HAPPENING IN SHELTERS OR JUST A DIFFERENT. DIFFERENT LOCATIONS- AND THEN I AS AS THE- MENTIONED- WE ALSO HAVE WITH OUR WEAVER- PROGRAMS WE DO EITHER DIRECTLY WHERE THEY'RE MANAGED BY US OR WITH OUR CARE MANAGEMENT ENTITIES. HAVE THERE HAVE THAT DIRECT OUT REACH. EACH YOU KNOW ARE YOU SAFETY UNIQUE THING. BUT WE ARE LOOKING AT IN THE FUTURE- YOU KNOW NOT IN FUTURE NOW FOR FUTURE SITUATIONS IS THIS ISSUE OF A. OUR Q. AND PEOPLE HAVE. BOTH DURATION IF YOU MEANT. JUST FOR CREEK BUT ALSO PEOPLE WHO SURVIVE ON THINGS THAT ARE POWER ELECTRICITY AND TYPICALLY HAVE SOME LEVEL OF BACK UP YOU KNOW YOU PS STUFF THAT CAN OPERATE FOR HOURS SPENT WHAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING WITH THESE POWER SHOT OFFICES HOURS ISN'T IS NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING AND SO HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT FROM A FEDERAL MEDICAID PERSPECTIVE. IS THE POTENTIAL FOR REAM. GENERATORS AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT SO WE ARE LOOKING INTO THAT THAT IS SORT OF A NEW IS NEWER ISSUE FOR US WITH THESE. SORT OF PS PS THINGS GOING ON FOR DAYS BUT DEFINITELY SOMETHING ON OUR LIST TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT OBVIOUSLY THE- THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO WE WANT TO TAKE CARE OF. WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THEM HARMED OR OR WORSE PARTICULARLY WHEN IT. OUR OUR- AND THERE IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT. YEAH I WOULD I WOULD JUST END BY SAYING YOU KNOW WE ARE NOT THE LEADER THAN AGENCY BUT WE WERE ACTIVELY ENGAGED. I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY WILL BE A VERY- ACTIVE AND ROBUST- AFTER IN CENTER AFTER EVENT. ANALYSIS TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT WE MORE- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY IS AN ISSUE NOTED IT DOES APPEAR THESE LOCKER. THE SERVER IN A VERY SHORT TERM ON A MORE OFTEN THAN ANYBODY BUT LIKE SO. YEAH JUST JUST JUST. UP AS SOMEONE WHO'S FRESH OFF OF SOME OF THESE EXPERIENCES- IT WAS IT WAS HAPPENING LIVE WHEN I WAS VISITING WITH YOU IN OFFICE LAST WEEK. WAS A MATTER OF FAITH. I THINK- IT ONE OF THE CONCERNS I HAVE IS THE LONG TERM- FOR EXAMPLE- AND CITY SANTA ROSA VISTA CLINIC- JUST RE OPENED- AFTER TWO YEARS BEING CLOSE SPEAKS OF THE TOP FIVE- AND THEN WAS AND THEN WAS THREATENED AGAIN BY THE CAN KICK FIRE. SO YOU KNOW I THINK THEY'RE GONNA HAPPEN YOU KNOW. HOUSE THERE'S AND THINGS ARE GOING GOING TO HAVE CHALLENGES BUT I THINK. IN THE LONG RUN- DUMBARTON ARE MORE VULNERABLE DESPITE POPULATION ARE GOING TO BE DISPLAYED I'M WERE SEEN SEE CAN SOME. AMOUNTS OF FOOD IN SECURE. AS PEOPLE OF LOST MAYBE JUST ONE BUT TWO. ENTIRE REFRIGERATORS FULL- AND SO I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE OUT REACH. IN SOME. FIRE IMPACTED AREAS ARE GONNA NEED TO BE RE DOUBLE BECAUSE THE LAST THING ON SOMEONE'S MIND IS LIKE. GETTING THERE TO PREVENTIVE VISIT THAT THEY MAY NOT EVEN KNOW EXISTED THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THEY TO DO THAT. AND I DO HAVE I DO HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS BECAUSE- WHAT MOST PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM PROBABLY DON'T KNOW UNLESS YOU LIVE YOUR LIVING AT- IN IN A SIGNIFICANT SECTION OF ONE OF MY COUNTIES. THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE ASKED BACK YET. SO YOU TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW. YEAH TAKING CARE OF EQUIPMENT AND THINGS AND ONE PHARMACIST IN THE WEST PARTISAN AS CINEMA COUNTY- COULDN'T GET IS GAS TURNED ON BECAUSE YOU HAD TO BE THERE IN PERSON AND HE WAS TAKING CARE OF PATIENTS WHO NEEDED MEDICATIONS SO WHEN EXTRA. NIGHTS WITHOUT HEATING IN HIS HOUSE SO THESE ARE THESE ARE BIGGER PICTURE ITEMS THAT NONE OF US EXPECTED TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH WE'RE TRYING TO INCREASE- ACCESS FOR KIDS AND ENSURING THAT HAPPENS BUT BUT I THINK IT IS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN OTHER PARTS THAT EIGHT AND WE NEED TO WE NEED TO WEAR THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A PLAN THAT. THAT THAT KIND ABOUT. IN AREAS THAT ARE TO BUY THIS STRIPS. I GOT. HE SAID THAT. IN IN ALMOST EVERY. PUBLIC VENUE WITH THE GOVERNOR IS AND YOU SAW SECRETARY GALLEY AT HIS SIDE I THINK IT WAS IT WAS- THAT WAS ON PURPOSE. BECAUSE THE VERY LARGE ROLE OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. PLAYS I GUESS OUR SISTER APARTMENTS PROMESAS SERVICES BY THE RAISING OF A CONTROL I MEAN- YOU KNOW- DSS FOR EXAMPLE EVEN THEM. EVEN THOUGH I TO THIS IS A MEDICAL BENEFIT WE DON'T. ACTUALLY OPERATED THAT WAY IT'S MORE DSS BUT THEY WERE VERY ACTIVE ENGAGE ON THE CARE GIVER SIDE. I YOU. OFFER TEMPLE THE PROGRAM ARE THEY ASK FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. YOU CAN DO A ONE TIME BASIS YOU CAN PLACE. CALPERS I'M IN THE LAST WEEK WE SELLERS SAYING WELL ENOUGH AS YOU ARE THINK ABOUT ME IT'S GOOD IT'S CHANGE RULES LAW BECAUSE THE SITUATION MISTER WHAT WAS JUST INDICATING. DIDN'T HAPPEN ONCE IT HAPPENED TWICE WILL. UNDER THE RULES ISN'T EQUIPPED FOR THAT MAYBE IT'S NEVER HAPPENED THE WORD ABOUT A ONE TIME FLOOD. OR HURRICANE OR SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN EVERY OTHER WEEK OR TWO THREE TIMES IN A SEASON SO AGAIN IS THE KIND OF THINGS AND OF THE SECRETARIES VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HE'S ASKED US. TO EMPLOY A LEAN FORWARD STRATEGY WHICH WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO AN END USER MAY TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE RICHEST IN. EXPECT TO THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH HAPPIER OVER LONGER PERIODS OF TIME AND SO WE'RE WE'RE OBVIOUSLY GOING TO DO THAT. JUST A FINAL FOLLOW UP HERE IN THIS IS REGARDS AND THINKING ABOUT TRAUMA AND KIDS- THESE FIRES AND THESE POWER OUTAGES AND THINGS- I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY FALL INTO YOUR DEFINITIONS AND WE'RE LOOKING TO LOOK AT THAT. BUT IS TRAUMATIC. I WILL TELL YOU ON THE NIGHT THAT THE FIRE STARTED THE CAN KATE FIRE STARTED- IT WAS LIKE SOMEBODY FOR SWITCH ON AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WE HAVE THESE IS. AMAZING WINS. I LOOKED OUT MY FRONT DOOR AND- I SAW SOME OF MY NEIGHBORS LEAVING- THEY LEFT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THEY EXPERIENCE THE FIRES. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IN THE SAME AREA AND- FLAP THAT NIGHT. AS WELL AND SO YOU KNOW THESE ARE FOR AND WAS WITH CHILDREN AND- THE KIDS ARE AFFECTED IT AFFECTS THEIR SCHOOL- PERFORMANCE AND IT OKAY. IN SOME CASES THERE THEIR FAMILIES THAT HAVE SOURCES BUT- WHAT A CASE. FAMILIES THAT DON'T COMMON OUT ON. FACT NOW YOU'VE. GOT SOME THESE MONIES WERE THE PARENT COMMITTEE. FOR AND NOW YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL STRESSORS OF POTENTIAL TRIAL YES SO I WOULD JUST SAY ON THAT WE EVERY DAY. KELLY IN CALIFORNIA FOR AND OUR OFFICE WAS CALLING EVERY COUNT EVERY AFFECTED COUNTY ASKING IF THEY NEEDED ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE- WE ALSO I WAS ON A ON A CALL PHYSICALLY TOGETHER WITH C. SACK CA S. C. C. B. H. D. A. AND SHE ACT WE WERE KIND OF GOING OVER WHAT IS THE BEST POINT OF CONTACT HOW WE MAKE SURE THERE ARE. ENOUGH MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS A PARTICULAR TO MY DO THESE ARE MORE IS MORE ON THE SHELTER OPERATION SIDE BECAUSE WE WERE EMERGENCY EVACUATION. MODE WILL HAVE TO GO WE'LL HAVE TO SEE OBVIOUSLY. INTO THEIR HOMES WHEN YOU PROBABLY GONNA SEE EXACTLY A BIGGER OF SO WE ARE WE ARE WATCHING THAT CAREFULLY AS WELL BUT JUST KNOW THAT WE ARE VERY. ENGAGE WITH POLICY PHD A CHECK AND SEE SECOND JOINTLY AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THE BEST APPROACH NOT JUST FROM EVACUATION. CENTER POINT OF VIEW- IN FACT WE WERE FAVOR OF BUGGING THEM TOO MUCH BY CALLING EVERY DAY THE SECOND IS THAT YOU WILL CALL EVERY DAY. WE DID CALL EVERY DAY ANALOG CASES YOU KNOW SOME OF THE- WE AT THE TUITIONS FOR EXAMPLE WERE WE HAD COUNTY OPERATIONS AND- CAN. SEE UP. DON'T EVEN. PLACE OVER THERE A SINGLE CHECKING ALL WHOLE BUNCH A COUNTIES AROUND HERE JUST TO SEE ANYONE ANYWHERE WHERE THERE'S A P. S. P. S. UNIT WAS A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. WE ARE STILL CALLING AND CHECKING IN WOULD BE EXPECTED TO CAN IT TO DO SO WE'RE VERY PROACTIVE. IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA- AS WELL AS TAKING WITH OUR HEALTH PLANS SO AGAIN WE WERE. WAS A TWENTY FOUR SEVEN THING. I'M MORE SABATINO OFFICE WAS STAYING OPEN WHICH MAKES THESE OUTBOUND CALLS- IN TERMS OF WHEN IT. TRIES OUT WERE EXPRESSING HOME- THAT'S WHAT. WE HAVE HOSPITAL'S. KAISER PARTICULAR. WHO WAS. IN MOVING PEOPLE FROM THE SANTA ROSA CENTER TO. DO SELF DISCO. WENT DOWN TO SAN MATTEO WHICH WE AYE WERE OTHER BIT. PEOPLE SO. I WAS VERY. ENGAGE ENVIRONMENT THAT UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE ARE ARE LIKELY TO. AND I THINK OF I THINK YOU RESERVE PARTICULARLY GOOD QUESTION ABOUT THE SCREENING AS WE DO FOR TRUMP TRUMP OBVIOUSLY THE SORT OF THE BENCHMARK AND WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO USE IS YOU KNOW REALLY THE PEARLS AND THE ACES THAT THAT IT THINGS. THAT WE ALL KNOW OR SUPER TRAUMATIC BUT I THINK THIS NEW WORLD OF- BECAUSE IT'S REALLY ACES ARE GETTING AT INSTABILITY FEELING A- FEELING LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE FOOD NOW THOSE. ELECTIONS ARE ARE MORE TIED TO OTHER TYPES OF THINGS THAT I THINK IT'S A VERY. QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT EXPANDING THE WAY WE DEFINE THAT BECAUSE LACK OF STABILITY OR LACK OF FEELING SAFE IN ITS IN A CHILD REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT'S- THE THINGS THAT ARE MENTIONED CURRENTLY IN THE ACES YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF INCARCERATION OR- NO DRUG. OTHER THING JUST REALITY LIVING IN A PLACE WHERE. WE WEEKS HAVING POWER TO OFFER YOUR HAVING FIRES HAVE EXCELLENT QUESTION IN SOMETHING- CERTAINLY WILL ENGAGE WITH THE SURGEON GENERAL ON ON HOW DO WE ACTUALLY EVEN THINK ABOUT THESE NEW TYPES OF TRAUMAS THAT MAYBE HAVEN'T EXISTED IN THE SERVE REPETITIVE NATURE THAT THEY'RE HAPPENING NOW THAT I THINK VERY MUCH FALL IN LINE WITH THE SAME TYPE IMPACTS USE IT FROM THAT LACK OF STABILITY IN YOUR HOME LIFE AS A AS A CHILD SO I THINK IT'S A GREAT AND IN SOME WE- CAN THINK OF HOW TO. ADD AS WELL I FEEL ONE. COMING UP. THEY'RE JUST A VERY BRIEF QUESTION. SIR IT'S NOT GOOD FOR OF THE VALUE BASED PURCHASING IS THERE ARE YOU INCLUDING THE PREVENTIVE SERVICES ISSUE AND YOUR VALUE BASED PURCHASING CELL OF THE FILE THAT IS CORRECT YES OKAY WILL FOLLOW UP ON THAT YES WE CAN DEMONSTRATE THE SPECIFIC METRICS FOR USING AND- THAT ALL REALLY IS INCENTIVES TO THE PROVIDERS PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES THEY DO. THROW THROUGH THE PLAN BUT IT'S NOT THE PLAN ACTUALLY GETTING THE BENEFIT IT IS GETTING THAT DOWN TO OKAY SO WILL OFTEN HAVE FOLLOW UP OKAY WITH THAT- I THINK WALL FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND- SO WE'LL GO AHEAD AND TAKE. PUBLIC COMMENT NOW. SO I ASK. KEEP YOUR MARKS TWO MINUTES OR LESS. THIS PASS UP THE SERGEANTS ANY WRITTEN MATERIAL YOU HAVE AS WELL- THIS TESTIMONY SO WELCOME AND PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF FIRST THANK YOU SO MUCH KELLY BEING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WE COVERED A LOT TODAY- SOULS THE MOST RECENT JUST ONE LET YOU ALL KNOW THAT WE ARE COLLABORATING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND PUT OUT A CALL TO.

FAMILIES AND ALSO WANTED TO KNOW WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH PARTNERS SPRING TECHNOLOGY AND TOOLS TO MORE PROVIDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SIMILAR TO THE EFFORTS THAT CENTRAL CALIFORNIA COAST MENTIONED SO PRACTICE TRANSFORMATIONS DIFFERENT REPORT SO THEY CAN PULL DOWN AND SEE WHO THEY NEED TO FOLLOW UP WITH. I'M KIND OF ON THE RIGHT HERE IS TO HEAR MY COMMENTS BUT. CONTRACTING THROUGHOUT THE STATE IS A RELATIVE BLACK BOX ARMS WERE LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING- THE DEBATE ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS AND WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB SIXTEEN FORTY TWO WILL BRING. WE ALSO AGREE WHOLEHEARTEDLY THAT RATES ARE NOT THE ONLY CONSIDERATION WHEN CONTACTING ITS ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN AND COST TO THE PRACTICE OF TAKING COMMERCIAL AND MEDI CAL.
