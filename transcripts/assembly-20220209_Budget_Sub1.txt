I AM HAPPY TO I QUESTIONS TO TURN IT OVER TO THE NEXT ANNALS THANK YOU DIRECTOR AND CHIEF STEP TO ONE HERE JULY JULY BAKER WITH APART OF FINANCE. HELLO THANK YOU CHAIR- WE JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED NO PROPOSALS FOR AUGMENTATIONS OF SERVICES FOR. THE BLIND OR VISION VISION IMPAIRED FOLKS- THAT ARE TRANSITIONING INTO JOB READY SERVICES AND THAT THERE HAS NOT BEEN A WAIT LIST- INDICATED NEED UP- ANY ACCESS FUNDING WE'RE AUGMENTATION FOR THESE PROGRAMS AND THAT'S IT FOR ME HAPPY DAY AND- THREE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM SONYA PADDOCK WITH THE L. L. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- CINEMATIC LA- WE DON'T HAVE ANY- SPECIFIC COMMENTS ON THIS INFORMATIONAL ITEM. OUR LAST TWO PRESENTERS ARE FROM THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL FOR THE BLIND WE WILL BEGIN WITH JEFF TOM THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS. YEAH. IN A DIRECT TOM IT APPEARS THAT YOU'RE ON MUTE. MISTER CHAIR IF I COULD HELP JEFF UP CONTROL M. WELL ON YOUR CHEEK. WE'RE STILL UNABLE TO HEAR YOU DIRECT MY ADMITTED ARE THERE YOU ARE YES OKAY SO I'M GONNA HAVE TO. WELL THE SPACEBAR DOWN BECAUSE I CAN'T GET THE COMMAND TO WORK. BUT I WILL DO THE BEST I CAN WITH ONE HAND. FIVE RIGHT. BOB SO MY NAME IS JEFF TOM I AM DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS FOR THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF THE BLIND. I AM TESTIFYING TODAY TO IMPART TO YOU ONE IMPORTANT FACT AND THAT IS TO EDUCATE YOU CONCERNING THE NEED FOR SERVICES TO THEIR ADULTS AND ALL ADULTS WHO ARE BLIND OR VISUALLY IMPAIRED. ALTHOUGH I'M GOING TO CONCENTRATE ON DATA FOR OLDER ADULTS ONE THING IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL THAT SHOULD BE REMEMBERED THAT IS IF YOU ARE UNDER FIFTY FIVE AND DO NOT HAVE AN EMPLOYMENT GOAL MOST ADULTS ABOUT WHEN THEY LOSE THEIR VISION DO NOT. YOU ARE INELIGIBLE FOR ALL OF THE SERVICES THAT. WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT LATER. BOTH INSTANCES DATA PAINT A PICTURE OF CALIFORNIA'S OLDER ADULTS WITH VISION LOSS THERE ARE CLOSE TO EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND OLDER ADULTS ONLY AND CALIFORNIA RURAL COUNTIES HAVE HIGHER PERCENTAGES OFTENTIMES THAN URBAN ONES. THE MAJORITY ARE WOMEN AND DUE TO VARIOUS FACTORS THERE ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH RATES OF AMERICANS LATIN ACTS AND THE NORDBY POPULATIONS NEARLY ONE THIRD OF OLDER ADULTS WITH VISION LOSS DO NOT HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION AND 40% HAVE INCOMES OF TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR LESS. ESTIMATES INDICATE THAT UP TO HALF OF OLDER ADULTS WITH VISION LOSS- OUR IN- STAR ESTIMATES INDICATE THAT HALF OF NURSING FACILITY RESIDENTS AB VISION IMPAIRMENT AND OLDER ADULTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO SUFFER FALLS AND HAVE CHRONIC MEDICAL CONDITIONS. FINALLY WHEN ADULTS LOSE MOST OR ALL OF THEIR VISION IT IS MORE COMMON THAN NOT THAT THEY VIEW THEIR LIVES AS ESSENTIALLY OVER IN A DOWNHILL SPIRAL FROM WHICH THEY WILL NOT RECOVER. THIS VIEW CREATE AND NOW OF SYRIA MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES SUCH AS SOCIAL. ISOLATION AND DEPRESSION THE APPROPRIATE SERVICES. THE PICTURE FOR THESE PEOPLE CAN BE ONE IN WHICH THEY RETURNED TO AN INDEPENDENT AND REWARDING LIFESTYLE SO WHAT ARE THESE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. BECAUSE THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT THE FUNDING FOR THESE SERVICES IS WOEFULLY LACKING. THEY NEED ORIENTATION AND MOBILITY SERVICES WHICH ALLOW THEM TO NAVIGATE IN THEIR HOME COMMUNITY OR NEIGHBORHOOD IT IS AMAZING HOW USING A CANE OR GUIDE DOG CAN. HAVE AN IMPACT ON ONE'S SELF CONFIDENCE THEY OF COURSE NEED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND THEY NEED AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT TECHNOLOGY TRAINING SO THEY CAN USE SMARTPHONES AND COMPUTERS. TO HELP ALL ASPECTS OF THEIR DAILY LIFE. BUT AS I HAVE SAID THE BIG ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM IS FUNDING AS YOU HEARD THERE IS FEDERAL FUNDING OF LITTLE MORE THAN THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE WHOLE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THIS AMOUNT HAS NOT INCREASED IN MANY YEARS. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THIS FUNDING NEEDS 3% OF THE NEED ON OF COURSE AS I HAVE SAID UNLESS YOU HAVE AN EMPLOYMENT GOAL. YOU ARE- IF YOU'RE UNDER FIFTY FIVE YOU'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THESE SERVICES. AS LIMITED AS THEY ARE. SO I URGE YOU TO CONSIDER EXPANDING THE OLDER INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE BLIND PROGRAM AND TO MAKE SURE THAT MORE AND MORE INDIVIDUALS WITH VISION LOSS ARE SERVE. TO EXPAND SERVICES UNDER THE MEDICARE EIGHT CBS PROGRAM TO INCLUDE THE SERVICES DESCRIBED ABOVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY. THANK YOU DIRECTOR TOM NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM SERRA HARASSED FIRST VICE PRESIDENT FOR THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF THE BLIND. READING OF EVERYONE AND GOOD AFTERNOON I AM SO HONORED TO BE WITH YOU TODAY- MY NAME IS TERRA PARENTS. AND AB JUST WANNA MAKE SURE BUT YOU CAN HEAR ME. COMING THROUGH LOUD AND CLEAR AWESOME YOU KNOW THE THING THAT SAID TELL US THAT WE'RE NOT CONNECTED WELL WE'LL FIGURE SO I AM THE FIRST VICE PRESIDENT FOR THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL THE BLIND AS WELL AS DIRECTOR OF PROGRAMS FOR RESOURCES FOR INDEPENDENCE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND I'M HERE TODAY AND IF HE A DIFFERENT PICTURE HELLO- SO IMAGINE THAT YOU ARE JUST DRIVING HOME FROM THE GROCERY STORE TYPICAL SUNDAY AFTERNOON DRIVING HOME LOOKING AT UNIFIL SENSE THAT ONE OF THOSE CUTS THAT LOOKING LIKE RAINBOW SHERBERT ORANGE AND GREEN AND PURPLE AND RED AND BEAUTIFUL AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN SOMEBODY RUNS A RED LIGHT. AND HIT YOUR CAR AND YOUR LIFE IS PUT INTO DARKNESS AND CHANGE FOREVER. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO ME I KNOW. THIRD AT THOUSAND TWO. I LOST MY VISION I'M TOTALLY BLINDS AND I HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR ONE YEAR- AND- HAD TO LEARN TO LIVE IT WILL BE DIFFERENT NINE. AT THAT TIME- DEPARTMENT REHABILITATION HAD A PROGRAM THAT- HANDED FORTUNE NAME OF THE HOMEMAKER TRACK- ARE PEOPLE WHO DID NOT HAVE AN EMPLOYMENT OR EDUCATION GOAL WERE ABLE TO RECEIVE INDEPENDENT LIVING SKILLS TRAINING. THAT IS SO IMPORTANT AND OF COURSE AT THE TIME IT WAS SENT- HE'S BIG ON TECHNOLOGY AS IT SHOULD BE NOW BECAUSE TECHNOLOGY WASN'T. AS AT. COPULAR OR OR REAL AND AVAIL FOR US THE TIME. I WAS ABLE TO LEARN SOME BROWN'S SCALES I WAS ABLE TO LEARN HOW TO USE A CANE SO HOW TO COOK AND CLEAN AGAIN AND THAT WAS ABOUT THE EXTENT OF THE TRAINING THAT I RECEIVED AT THAT TIME. AND NOW THOUGH IF THAT WERE TO HAPPEN IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND. TWENTY EIGHT TO SOMEONE. THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO RECEIVE THOSE SAME SERVICES. THE CEREMONY AND THEY DID NOT HAVE AN EMPLOYMENT OR EDUCATION GOAL MOST PEOPLE WHO USE THEIR STATE LIKE MYSELF TRAGICALLY- IN AN ACCIDENT ARE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO GO AND WAKE UP A WEEK LATER GO ALL RIGHT SO NOW I KNOW I WANT TO DO THAT SO I WANT TO BE A TEACHER AND ONE OF THE AMERICAN FAMILY THERAPIST. WHATEVER IT MAY BE THAT'S NOT GOING TO JUMP OUT OF THEIR BRAIN ALL THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS TO LEARN HOW TO LIVE AGAIN. AND I HAVE FOUND THAT THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE BLIND OR HAVE LOW VISION. WHO ARE UNDER THE AGE OF FIFTY FIVE. AND OVER THE AGE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN SCHOOL THAT ARE. NOT RECEIVING SERVICES BECAUSE THE BEST BECAUSE THERE'S NOT THE FUNDING ANYMORE. TO SUPPORT PEOPLE RECEIVING SERVICES THAT ARE SO NEEDED. AND IT IS A VERY TRAGIC THING WHEN WE LOOK AT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE A TON OF PEOPLE OUT THERE THE BETTER I'M HAPPY. HERE TO PROTEST THE NOT RECEIVING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES EITHER BECAUSE IT'S JUST THE FUNDING ISN'T. THERE I. RANG THE SPORTS YOU AND HAVE. AND REALLY HOPE THAT WE CAN LOOK AT A WAY THAT WE CAN BRIDGE THIS GAP AND FIVE SERVICES AND FIND FUNDING FOR PEOPLE. WHO THAT SCARE SITE. AND HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO LIVE AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- BEFORE WE RETURN TO MEMBERS QUESTIONS SOMEONE ASKED THAT WE TAKE ROLE. DR ARAMBULA HERE MATHIS HERE PATTERSON RAMOS RUBIO DR WOULD QUORUM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WILL NOW TURN TO SEE IF ANY MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS ON THIS ISSUE- I WILL BRING IT BACK. TO THE CHAIR AND WOULD LIKE AN OPPORTUNITY TO FOLLOW UP WITH DIRECTOR XAVIER AFTERWARDS. BUT LATER IN THE AGENDA WE WILL- SEE ON PAGE EIGHTEEN. HOW THERE IS A RISK OF EXPOSURE TO THE STATE OF FOR NOT. ACCOMMODATING AND SUPPORTING AND ENGAGING OUR- DEAF COMMUNITY IN. RESULTING IN ISOLATION AND LACK OF MEANINGFUL COMMUNICATION. AND HEARING WHAT WE HAVE TODAY FROM- DIRECTOR TOM AND FROM SARAH HARRIS I BELIEVE THERE'S A RESPONSIBILITY FOR US TO MAKE SURE WE ARE. ADDRESSING THE SOCIAL ISOLATION AND HOW WE CAN ENSURE THAT THEY ARE CONNECTED TO THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT THEY WERE SPEAKING ABOUT TODAY AND SO WOULD. LIKE TO HAVE FOLLOW UP CONVERSATIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION IS DOING ALL IT CAN TO SUPPORT. BLIND CALIFORNIANS AND JUST WANTED TO. MAKE SURE TO BRING THAT UP- AT. THE END I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE TO HAVE A REQUEST FROM THE CHAIR WHICH IS TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION ON PROJECTED NEEDS AND CAPACITY FOR THE EXPANSION OF THE SERVICES. OF THE BLIND POPULATIONS THAT ARE NOT SCHOOL AGED FOUR WHO ARE OVER THE AGE OF FIFTY FIVE. I BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT HAVING HEARD THE TESTIMONY TODAY TO MAKE SURE WE ARE LOOKING AT THAT POPULATION- BETWEEN THOSE SCHOOL AGES AND OVER FIFTY FIVE TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE CONNECTING THEM TO THE APPROPRIATE SERVICES IN REAL TIME AS WELL. I WOULD ASK THAT YOU BRING THAT INFORMATION BACK TO THE SUB COMMITTEE ON MY STAFF BY FRIDAY- FRIDAY APRIL EIGHTH OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. I'M LOOKING TO SEE IF THAT'S AMENABLE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION. SURE WE APPRECIATE THE REQUEST WAS CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE ASK WERE WERE CONCERNED THAT THE WINDOW OF TIME. TO CONDUCT ANALYSIS IS BEING ASKED FOR- MIGHT MIGHT NOT PROVIDE US WITH THAT OPPORTUNITY- I KNOW MISTER TOM SHARE SOME INFORMATION. ABOUT SOME BROAD PROBABLY SOME OF THE NUMBERS THAT EXISTS. BUT IT IT WOULD REQUIRE BE ENABLED SHOULD NOT ONLY IDENTIFY THE INDIVIDUALS. BUT WHICH OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHAT WANT TO GET JUST SET UP THE SERVICE SAYS- IF THEY WERE ELIGIBLE. FOR THE SERVICE I THINK THERE'S JUST A NUMBER OF. ACTORS TOOK. I MAY ASSESSMENT OF THAT. I WONDER WHAT TIME MAY NOT ALLOW US TO- DIRECTORS AB HAPPY TO WITH YOU AND OUT HOW TO HAVE THE TIMELINE WORK FOR US ALL AND- APPRECIATE THE ABILITY TO ENGAGE WITH YOUR OFFICE GOING FORWARD. MISTER ROGER. YEAH LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT DRUM I WOULD I WOULD ONLY SAY THAT. PRIOR TO THE TIME THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PRECLUDED CALIFORNIA FROM SURVEYING THIS POPULATION WHEN THEY DID NOT HAVE AN EMPLOYMENT GOAL- THAT THERE WAS A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE BEING SERVED. THAT DID NOT HAVE SUCH A GOAL AND I KNOW THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS WELL AWARE THAT CAN PROVIDE THE STATISTICS. THAT WERE AFFECTED BY THAT POINT IN TIME. YES JEFF THAT IS CORRECT DATA THAT WOULD BE SPECIFIC CHAIR WHEN AND IF THE CHAIR WISHES I CAN PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE DETAIL ON WHAT A HOMEMAKER. THIS WILL LOOK LIKE BUT DATA THAT WOULD BE SPECIFIC TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS. WERE ENOUGH HOMEMAKER STATUS THAT WE CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE. MORE ACCESS TO. WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS AND I'D LIKE TO THANK ALL OF OUR PANELISTS WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ISSUE TO WHICH IS THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES ISSUES WE WILL HEAR ABOUT THREE OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS AND FIVE ISSUES UNDER IMPLEMENTATION AND OVERSIGHT. WE WILL HAVE FIVE PRESENTERS ON ISSUE TOO WE WILL BEGIN WITH DIRECTOR NANCY BARTMAN THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES AS WELL AS MULTI CHRIS UPON DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. MR FOR BOB NEILL FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SONYA PADDOCK THE PRINCIPAL ANALYST WITH THE L. A. L. AND LORENA GONZALEZ EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE ALTA CALIFORNIA REGIONAL CENTER. LET'S BEGIN WITH DIRECTOR APARTMENT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS- APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TO YOU OUR PROPOSALS FOR GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- AND LOOK FORWARD TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE- INCLUDED IN THE AGENDA TODAY I DO WANT TO THANK THE STAFF FOR- PROVIDING A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE PROPOSALS AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION- IT IS A REAL PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE TO YOU A COUPLE THAT PROPOSAL SENATE. AND WE'RE DOING- ON THIS ISSUE- THIS IS A PARTICULAR ISSUE THAT IS A VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART BECAUSE I STARTED MY CAREER WITHIN. THEIR REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM- WITH EARLY INTERVENTION AND WORKING WITH CHILDREN FROM BIRTH THROUGH FIVE- SO AS WE TAKE A LOOK AT OUR SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES WE ARE GROWING DEPARTMENT- THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE SERVING CONTINUES TO GROW EACH YEAR SO BY CONTEXT RIGHT NOW. WE'RE ANTICIPATED APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS THAT WE WOULD BE SURVEYED IN THIS NEXT YEAR THAT'S APPROXIMATELY AT AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY TWO THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS FROM WHAT IS ESTIMATED IN CURRENT YEAR- DDS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SERVICES UNDER THE LANHAM AND DEVELPMENTAL DISABILITIES SERVICES ACT BUT ALSO- FOR THE EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES ACT- FOR ENSURING THAT MORE THAN- THE- OVER FIFTY THOUSAND CHILDREN- IN EARLY START ARE RECEIVING SERVICES AND SUPPORTS- SAME WITH THE INDIVIDUALS UNDER THE LETTERMAN ACT TO BE ABLE TO REALLY MAKE THOSE CHOICES THAT LEAD- INDEPENDENT AND- AND LIFE THAT THEY CHOOSE TO LEAVE- WE WORK. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR CONSUMERS FAMILIES- SERVICE PROVIDERS REGIONAL CENTERS OTHER STATE DEPARTMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE WORKING ON INTENT AND TO HAVE A VISION FOR WHAT THAT LIFETIME OF PREFERRED CHOICE FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE. ON ISSUE TO TODAY. I'M MORE FOCUSED IN- START PARTY TO BE IT ALSO- EXT- FROM AGE TO UP AGE. AND THE- THE TO. ISSUESTHAT WE'RE GOING TO REVIEW- HAS QUESTIONS THAT ARE OUTLINED IN YOUR AGENDA SO JUST FOR WE'RE TRACKING I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PROVIDE- RESPONSES TO YOUR QUESTIONS- A. B. AND D. AND THEN MY COLLEAGUE WILL GO AHEAD AND- FINISH UP OUR PANEL- ON C. E. AND AT. SO THE PRO THAT WE HAVE FORWARD IS REDUCING CASELOAD RATIOS FOR CHILDREN FROM BIRTH THROUGH AGE FIVE- REDUCING THOSE CASELOAD RATIOS ONE TO FORTY AND THE QUESTION IS ASKED AS TO HOW DID WE COME UP WITH. KIND OF THAT ESTIMATE OF ONE TO FORTY WE HAD ORIGINALLY AND THAT- PROPOSED SPENDING PLAN HAD AN ESTIMATE OF ONE TO FORTY FIVE. HOWEVER IF THERE'S SOME INFORMATION THAT CAME FORWARD TO US- THROUGH SOME OF THE WORK IN THE TARGETED- REDUCE CASELOAD RATIOS OF AN INITIATIVE- THAT WAS INTRODUCED IN- LAST BUDGET CYCLE THAT'S A LOW TO NO POS. I'M E. LARK- SOEASTERN LOS ANGELES REGIONAL CENTER- HAD- SUBMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT- AS PART OF THEIR DISPARITY GRANT AND- TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. FOR APPROVAL TO BE ABLE TO HAVE LOW TO NO POS FOR CHILDREN- WHO HAD PRIMARY LANGUAGE THAT WAS NOT ENGLISH. AND THEY HAD- REALLY STRUGGLE TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS SERVICES AND EXPENDITURES- FOR THOSE SERVICES ARE CONNECTING TO OTHER- GENERIC RESOURCES. AND THROUGH THIS PROPOSAL THEY REALLY DID EMONSTRATES THAT HAVING A ONE TO FORTY CASELOAD RATIO REALLY PRODUCE POSITIVE OUTCOMES IT ONLY PRODUCED OUTCOMES AS FAR AS- THE EXPENDITURES THAT WERE REALIZED BY- THE FAMILIES BEING ABLE TO ACCESS SERVICES. BUT ALSO REALLY DEMONSTRATING THEIR ABILITY TO NAVIGATE- THE SYSTEMS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS THE REGIONAL CENTER WHAT IS EDUCATION. SUPPORT THEY REALLY NOT ONLY LIKE I SAID BE ABLE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE QUESTIONS AS TO ACCESSING SERVICES BUT REALLY CREATING. A LIFELONG ADVOCACY OR UNDERSTANDING OF SERVICES THAT WOULD BENEFIT THEM- ALSO WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT HOW DO WE IMPROVE SOME OF THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE TO TRANSITION CHILDREN FROM PARK CITY WHICH IS OUR EARLY START PROGRAM. UNDER THE EDUCATION THAT WE ARE ABLE TO- PROVIDE THOSE SUPPORTS TO TRANSITION WHEN THEIR- AT TWO YEARS NINE MONTHS TO THREE YEARS OLD. TO EDUCATION THIS IS BEEN PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING FOR MANY FAMILIES AS SO IN MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE BEING RESPONSIVE NOT ONLY TO THE FAMILIES BUT THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE UNDER SB EIGHTY FIVE SEVENTY FIVE. WHICH IS OUTLINED IN YOUR AGENDA TODAY THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE WORKGROUP HAD- MADE SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS SO CERTAINLY THE CASELOAD RATIOS AS RIGHT AS RESPONSE TO THAT. BUT ALSO TAKING A LOOK AT HOW DO WE GET INCLUSION FOR PRESCHOOL- WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH CVP THEY'VE BEEN A REALLY GREAT PARTNER THROUGH THE PROCESS OF SB SEVENTY FIVE. BUT ALSO TAKING A LOOK AT HOW CAN WE TAKE- ALL OF THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING THAT CAN COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER. SO WITH THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS- PROPOSING- FOR INCLUSIVE PRESCHOOL OPPORTUNITIES IT REALLY IS NOT. IN CONFLICT WITH THE PROPOSALS THAT CD IS BEEN WORKING ON IN PRESCHOO WE REALLY SEE IT AS A COMPLIMENT AND BEING ABLE TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW CAN WE ACCESS MORE THE PRIVATE PRESCHOOLS. GROUP PARTICULARLY IN THOSE AREAS WHERE FAMILIES ARE HAVING A STRUGGLE IN IDENTIFYING AND FINDING THOSE INCLUSIVE OPTIONS- AND AGAIN A LOT OF THIS IS UNDER THOSE- WITH THOSE FAMILIES WHO- I HAD. DIFFICULTY SERVICES. SO- AND WITH THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THAT THE- AT THE ENDS BUT FOR NOW I'LL GO AHEAD AND- HANDED OFF TO MY COLLEAGUE. REPORTS AND- HAPPENING WHERE MEMBERS OF THE SECOND PART OF MICHAEL SERVICES SAID UNDER THE INTENDS TO AT THE PER MIX OF STAKEHOLDER AND CONDUCT OUTREACH TO PREPAY PRIVATE PRESCHOOL DEPUTY DIRECTOR WERE A TIME- YOUR SOUND IS THERE IN CHANCE WE CAN TRY TO MAKE AN IMPROVING. IS IT. IS SO HARD REACH OUT THAT HERE- MISTER CHAIR. THE MAN ARE HAVING A HARD TIME IS WHAT THEY'RE TELLING ME RIGHT NOW. IT IT JUST SOUNDS A LITTLE MORE WEEK BARELY YOU. AB I'LL TRY TO MOVE CLOSER THE- DOES THAT HELP OR IT A STILL HERE MUCH IF YOU'RE TO THE MIKE A WE CAN HEAR OU CLEARLY NOW- MISTER. THINGS THANKS FOR THE ME KNOW- SO- LIKE I AND AT BUT DIRECT PARCHMAN HIM. HAS SHARED PROPOSAL PRESCHOOL INCLUSION IS- ENACT IS THAT WE- ENGAGE IN THE THE COMMUNITY BASIN PRESCHOOLS SPECIFICALLY THOSE THE COOPER. AND BELIEVE. INCLUSIVE ALL- RITUALS CONSUME. THIS IS THE COLORING. WEDDING GROUP IDENTIFIED MEANINGFUL OUTCOME AND GUARDRAILS. SO WE CAN PREVENT AND CONSEQUENCES. ARBACO FOLK ON THREE FOUR YEAR OLD TO WHO ARE. AND YOU SEE REGIONAL. SERVICES THAT'S LAID IN THE- I SPOKE WHEN. EVERY OUR PROPOSAL IS THAT WE ASSIST THAT ARE EXPERTS THE EDGE OF. LAW THAT IN BECAUSE- ANSWERED. OR AS WE IN. BUDGET CHANGED THAT I A SPECIAL THIS. FIRST OF ALL THE- WILL NOT CASE. THE IB EXPRESS IS THE EACH CENTER WILL PROVIDE TECHNICAL THIS. AND SUPPORT SIR FOR THE- AND EDGE. EIGHT AND FAMILIES THROUGH THE TRI. AS DIRECTOR PARCHMENT- THAT THAT WHEN- ARE. TO SO YOU'RE- TWO YEARS OF MY OLD- ARTSY KIDS HOW THE CHANCE TO PART B. RESPECT THAT YOU. AND THIS. WILL ALSO SUPPORT- REGIONAL CENTERS IN L. EIGHTIES AND FED REQUIRED AND- JOB PER. SUCH AS THE VOTE COULD NOT THE ONLY TIME WE BUT HI QUALITY IN THE- FAMILY SERVICE PLANS. ARE IS THAT IN SERVICE. IN BY THE I SPECIALISTS. WILL INCREASE FAMILY AWARENESS OF THEIR RIGHTS AS THE FOR A CHILD SCHEDULE. SUPPORT AND- WITH THAT HAPPY TO THE PASSAGE BACK TO MR. THANK YOU NEXT WILL HEAR FROM THE OF FINE. KRISTER O'NEILL. THANK YOU MISS CHAIR- CHRISTOPHER- O'NEILL FINE- NO FURTHER INFER TO SHARE THIS TIME THANK YOU. NEXT WE WILL FROM SONYA PADDOCK WITH THE L. A. THANK YOU AND GO AND MEMBERS SO YOU PAY FROM THE L. A. I WOULD HAVE A FEW COME TO MAKE ABOUT THIS- SOME OF THE CAN COMES TO CASE RATIO WE KNOW THAT STAR MEASURES THAT ARE TO THE FED GOVERNMENT SUCH AS TIMELY IN THE WAY THE SERVICES AS WELL TIMELY IN SETTING UP PLANNING PRIOR TO THE TRIAL THIRD BIRTHDAY. SO ARMY. TO THE- WAS ABOUT WHETHER A ONE TO HAVE. CASELOAD RATIOS THE RIGHT REYES DDS- TESTIFIED TO AT THIS HEARING AS WELL AS SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THEY PROVIDED OUR OFFICE YESTERDAY WE THINK THE JUSTIFICATION FOR ONE TO FORTY DOES SEEM REASONABLE. HOWEVER THERE ARE TWO ISSUES THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO RAISE THAT ARE UP IN. THAT ARE IN THE- PROPOSED ASSOCIATED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. SO THE FIRST IS THAT THE ONE TO FORTY CASELOAD RATIO WOULD NOT BE IN STATUTE INSTEAD SIGNIFICANT DISCRETION WOULD BE GIVEN TO YOU AT THAT APARTMENT TO WORK IT OUT IN REGIONAL CENTER CONTRACTS- IN ADDITION WE KNOW THAT ONLY ONE. NEW AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL ONLY ONE NEW REQUIREMENT IS INCLUDED FOR SERVICE COORDINATORS IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND THAT IS. QUARTERLY REVIEWS OF THE CHILD'S INDIVIDUALIZED FAMILY SERVICE PLAN. WE WERE WONDERING IF ANY OF THE OTHER- THE SORT OF ACTIVITIES THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS HOPING THAT SERVICE COORDINATORS WILL BE ABLE TO DO SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THIS LANGUAGE INCLUDING- FOR EXAMPLE. ACCOMPANYING THE FAMILY TO THE CHILD IN THE BOOK INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATION PLAN MEETING AT THE SCHOOL IF THE FAMILY. WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT TYPE OF SUPPORT. ON THE ISSUE OF REGIONAL CENTER IDEA'S SPECIALISTS- WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT THESE SPECIALISTS WOULD NOT BE- HAVING CASELOAD OF THEIR OWN BUT WOULD INSTEAD BE PROVIDING SUPPORT TO THE SERVICE COORDINATORS THAT SERVE THESE CHILDREN AS WELL AS- BEING SORT OF. A SPECIALIST OR TECHNICAL- OR OR SOMEBODY WHO'S ABLE TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WHEN IT COMES TO WORKING WITH THE DIFFERENT SCHOOLS IN THE AREA. AND OUR QUESTION I GUESS IS REALLY WHETHER SOME OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS. THAT HAVE- A LOT MORE CHILDREN IN THIS AGE AS WELL AS A LOT MORE SCHOOLS IN THEIR CATCHMENT AREA. IF IF ONE A SPECIALIST IS REALLY SUFFICIENT TO SORT OF PROVIDE THE SUPPORT TO THE SERVICE COORDINATORS AND WORK WITH THE SCHOOLS IN THAT AREA. WE'RE JUST NOT NOT SURE THAT THAT ONE. WHY IT'S NECESSARILY ONE SPECIALIST PER REGIONAL CENTER. IN THEN WHEN IT COMES. THE PRESCHOOL INCLUSION PROPOSAL WE THINK THE INTENT OF THIS PROPOSAL MAKES A LOT OF SENSE BUT RIGHT NOW THE PROPOSAL IS JUST NOT VERY REFINED. SO FOR EXAMPLE- APART FROM THE INFORMATION PROVIDED TODAY AT THE HEARING ABOUT USING A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS THERE ARE THERE ARE NOT A LOT OF DETAILS ABOUT HOW THIS WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED- WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW THE PARTICULAR PRESCHOOLS WOULD BE IDENTIFIED OR WHAT TYPES OF SUPPORT. THEY WOULD NEED SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE STAFF MIGHT NEED MORE TRAINING THEY MIGHT NEED MORE ADAPTIVE EQUIPMENT OR THEIR BUILDINGS WE NEED TO CHANGES TO MAKE THEM MORE ACCESSIBLE- WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY WOULD ACTUALLY NEED EXTRA STAFFING OR IF IT WOULD SIMPLY- IF THEY'D SIMPLY NEED TO ALLOW CHILDREN TO BRING. IN THEIR PERSONAL AIDES OR PERSONAL- SUPPORTS. I HAVEN'T IN ADDITION WE KNOW THAT LOT OF PRESCHOOLS. A RUN FOR THE SAME NUMBER OF HOURS AS DAYCARES SO WERE IT'S UNCLEAR TO US WHETHER- GETTING MORE CHILDREN IN TO PRESCHOOL WILL- PROVIDED COVERAGE FOR FAMILIES WHO ARE WORKING- AND THEN FINALLY WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS IS BASED ON AND WHAT WHAT THIS WILL ACTUALLY- GET THE STATE IN TERMS OF HOW MANY PRESCHOOLS WILL BE SERVED AND- YOU KNOW WHAT IT. SUPPORT THE KINDS OF CHANGES THAT THESE PRESCHOOLS NEED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM GLORIA GONZALEZ THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF ALTA CALIFORNIA REGIONAL CENTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS- GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS LAURIE BEEN ALL THIS AND AS YOU MENTIONED I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AT ALL TO CALIFORNIA REGIONAL CENTER I WORKED AT THE REGIONAL CENTER FOR THE PAST TWENTY SIX YEARS OF SERVING IN MULTIPLE CAPACITIES AND ROLES- EARLY START CHILDREN SERVICES IS AN AREA OF GREAT INTEREST AND FOCUS FOR ME AND FOR OUR REGIONAL CENTER- ON EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES INCLUDING CASE MANAGEMENT. ARE CRITICAL AND PROMOTE DEVELOPMENT IN SUPPORT I'VE FOR FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES. FOR OUR YOUNGEST CLIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. IT'S MY PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY TO SHARE HOW THESE INVESTMENTS THAT DOCTOR DIRECTOR BIRDS BECAUSE RIGHT INDICATED THAT HERE ARE INCLUDED IN THE- PROPOSAL FROM THE BUDGET- SERVE CHILDREN- REALLY WELL AND I AM PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR GREAT OUTCOMES- I WAS ASKED TO ADDRESS TWO QUESTIONS. ARE THE FIRST TO DESCRIBE HOW THESE PROPOSALS WOULD CHANGE OR IMPACT REGIONAL CENTER SERVICES FOR INFANTS AND TODDLERS. I AT THE TRANSITION TO PRESCHOOL. THE FIRST IS THE REDUCTION OF CASELOAD SIZE AND IT'S BEEN- COMPETENT COMMENTED ON THEM. IN TESTIMONY PREPARED PRIVATE PRIOR TO MINE BUT I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT BEING ABLE TO HAVE A REDUCTION IN CASE SITES UP FOR EACH SERVICE COORDINATOR SUPPORTING CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF SIX TO A CASELOAD OF FORTY. WILL ALLOW SERVICE COORDINATORS THE TIME TO ASSIST SUPPORT FAMILIES MORE INTENSIVELY. HAVING A CHILD WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS OR DIAGNOSE DISABILITY CAN BE VERY STRESSFUL FOR FAMILIES. FAMILIES ARE GRIEVING AND EACH FAMILY PRESENTS DIFFERENTLY THEY NEED TIME AND ATTENTION TO WALK THEM THROUGH THE SYSTEM. AND TO DISCOVER. WHAT THE SERVICES. AND SUPPORTS ARE THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM. AT LEAST NEEDS OF ALSO NOW BIG THE MOLD SAYS. OF THAT WILL BE A WORK WITH ARE THERE NOW THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM- MEDICAL. AND THE MEDICAL ENTITIES- AS WELL AS- EDUCATION AND SERVICE PROVIDERS. AND THE COME FROM REGIONAL CENTER AS WELL AS THROUGH THE MEDICAL INSURANCE. REGIONAL CENTER SERVICE COORDINATORS CAN BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST SUPPORTERS ON THIS JOURNEY AND PROVIDING EDUCATION AND SUPPORT TO FAMILIES. ON THEIR HOME BASE FOR MANY MANY FAMILIES THE SERVICE COORDINATOR COORDINATES EDUCATES ASSESSES AND PROVIDES SUPPORT TO THE FAMILY. IT'S PROPOSAL SERVICE. MORE TIME. WITH THESE INDIVIDUAL FAMILIES TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THE LEVEL SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED FOR THEIR CHILD TO HAVE THE BEST OUTCOMES INCLUDING THE CRITICAL POINT OF TRANSITIONING FROM EARLY START SERVICES TO SPECIAL EDUCATION. I'M CHILDREN EXIT THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM AT THIS POINT AND A SOFT HAND OFF TO EDUCATION IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. FOR OTHER CHILDREN AT AGE THREE THEY'LL TRANSITION TO THE LAN URBAN SERVICES TO A CHILDREN'S UNIT AT THE REGIONAL CENTER. LOWER CASE LOADS WILL ALLOW FOR THE SPECIALIZED SUPPORT TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THAT EDUCATION IN ADVOCACY AND SUPPORTING FAMILIES TO BETTER SERVE OTHER CHILDREN TO BOTH SYSTEMS. ARE ALSO ASSESSING AND PROVIDING NEEDED REGIONAL CENTER SERVICES. THE SECOND INVESTMENT THAT WAS MENTIONED WAS THE SPECIAL EDUCATION SPECIALIST. TWENTY EIGHT REGIONAL CENTER- WITHIN IDEA'S SPECIALISTS TO TRAIN AND SUPPORT SERVICE COORDINATORS AS WELL AS TO GUIDE FAMILIES THROUGH THE TRANSITION PROCESS FROM PARTS FEE TO PART B. IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL TO HAVE THIS POSITION I HAVE WITHIN REGIONAL CENTERS TO CRIED THIS INCREASED AWARENESS FOR FAMILIES TO PROVIDE TRAINING AND SUPPORT NOT ONLY TO OUR STAFF THE TWO FAMILIES I TO BE A LIAISON THROUGH EDUCATION AND THE REGIONAL CENTER- AND TO REALLY HELP TO PROMOTE- YOU KNOW THE EDUCATION SYSTEM IN THE REGIONAL SYSTEM COLLABORATING AND COORDINATING IN THE BEST INTEREST. OF CHILDREN SERVED THE THIRTY BEST MAN IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INCLUSIVENESS ASSESSABLE PRESCHOOL OPPORTUNITIES FOR CHILDREN AGES. THREE AND FIVE THREE FIVE. THE INCLUSION IS THE- INCLUDING MAKES DE LOW DIFFERENT WHEN SHE LEARN SIDE BY. THIS SUPPORTS EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT. I'M TO BE INCLUDED IS A REALLY POWERFUL THING I IN THE BENEFITS OF INCLUSION AREN'T JUST LIMITED TO THE CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES- BUT ALSO TO THEIR NON DISABLED PEERS WILL BENEFIT AS WELL. ADDITIONALLY THIS A PROPOSAL SUPPORTS FAMILY CHOICE IN HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACCESS OF POLLUTION OF PRIVATE PRESCHOOL OR PUBLIC PRESCHOOL. A SECOND QUESTION THAT WAS PROMOTED UNDER MY TESTIMONY SECTION WAS WHAT ARE THE AREAS WHERE SPECIAL ATTENTION AS THE STATE LOOKS TO INCREASE APPROVED SERVICES FOR CHILDREN AN EARLY START. WELL REGIONAL CENTERS CONTINUE TO WORK REALLY DILIGENTLY ARE FOCUSING ON INCREASING. ACCESS WITH SERVICE ACCESS AND EQUITY- MAKING SURE THAT EARLY START IS ASSESSABLE TO EACH CLIENT AND THEIR FAMILY. ENSURING THAT SERVICES AND SUPPORTS ARE IN LINE WITH THE CULTURE AND THE LANGUAGE OF PREFERENCES A FAMILY. A BUILDING THAT REPERTOIRE AND THAT ABILITY TO HAVE A NETWORK OF SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT CAN SUSTAIN THIS I NEED- GIVEN THE COMPLIMENTS AND- COMPLEXITIES AND EACH COMMUNITY  VER DIFFERENCE- IN WHAT THE DATA SUPPORTS AS WELL WHAT THE NEEDS ARE. CALIFORNIA REGIONAL CENTER FOR THE SURFACED COUNTY IN EACH COUNTY I A DIFFERENT NEED INTO. OF WHY IS A NEW TO SUPPORT FAMILIES WITH PREFERENCE CULTURAL- SUPPORT. SO NEED TO LOOK AT THAT DAY AND WE NEED TO GO OUT AND I HAVE THE SUPPORT AND ABILITY TO ENGAGE WITH STARTUPS PROVIDERS UNDER THE R. F. P. AND GET FOLKS IN PLACE TO SUPPORT THE FAMILIES. ADDITIONALLY WE WANT TO YOU KNOW WILL ROLL OUT WHAT IS IN CURRENT BUDGET AND THAT'S THE IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING I TO ALL OF OUR REGIONAL CENTER STAFF INCLUDING- YOU KNOW CONTRACTORS THAT PROVIDE INTAKE PROCESS SUPPORT. AND LASTLY- IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW I MENTIONED ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE FLEXIBILITY AND ASSESSMENT AND SERVICE PROVISION. THAT'S BEEN AFFORDED A THROUGHOUT THIS PANDEMIC HAS SERVED FAMILIES WHILE HAVING THE ABILITY TO RECEIVE REMOTE SERVICES HAS PROVIDED CONTINUITY. FOR OUR CLIENTS SERVED AND IT'S ALSO INCREASE THE ABILITY OF OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS. TO SEE MORE CLIENTS WHEN YOU CUT OUT OF THE TRAVEL TIME. GOING FORWARD TO BE REALLY WONDERFUL IF THESE OPTIONS COULD CONTINUE AT LEAST TO SOME DEGREE IN CAPACITY. ENCLOSING ARCA ARE ASSOCIATION APPRECIATES THE GOVERNOR'S INCLUSION OF THESE CRITICAL INVESTMENTS IN HIS PROPOSED BUDGET. AND WE SUPPORT THEIR APPROVAL AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE TODAY. THANK YOU EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR BUT KNOWLES'S WITH THAT I WILL RETURN UP THE DICE TO SEE IF ANY MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS ON THIS ITEM. C. NINE NINE IWILL FOLLOW UP ON TWO OF THE QUESTIONS FROM THE L. A. L. TO DIRECTOR BARGE MAN IF I CAN- I. ENJOYED YOUR RESPONSE AND JUSTIFICATION FOR THE- ONE TO FORTY RATIO. AND IT I WOULD AGREE IT DOES SEEM REASONABLE BASED ON WHAT YOU'RE PRESENTING BUT WOULD LOVE TO FOLLOW UP ON THE- EAST LA REGIONAL CENTER DATA THAT YOU. PRESENTED BUT WOULD LIKE TO QUESTION AS THE ELLIE- STATED WHY WE'RE NOT. PLACING THIS IN STATUTE WHY WERE NOT CODIFYING THE RATIO AT ONE TO FORTY IF WE- BELIEVE THAT ULTIMATELY- SHOWS BETTER RESULTS AND HOPING. YOU COULD COMMENT ON THAT. THANK MISTER SO I THE- CARE RATIOS AND THEN ALL WITH THE BECAUSE- WE HAVE BEEN. A OF THE POSITIONS- AS WE HAD NOTED AND I THINK YOU'LL SEE OUTLINED IN THE SUMMARY OF DIFFERENT INITIATIVES OVER- THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THAT HAVE BEEN TARGETED FOR SPECIALIZED- ATTENTION. ON SOME EXAMPLES INCLUDE THE CULTURAL SPECIALIST- INCLUDE- THE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS- ALSO OUR EMPLOYMENT SPECIALIST EACH OF THOSE WE HAVE TAKEN THE APPROACH CENTER- AND THEN EACH TIME WE'VE BEEN HAVING THE- CHANGES IN CASELOAD RATIOS AND THEN ALSO WITH THEY ADDED POSITIONS- WE FOUND THAT THE- INCLUSION IN THE CONTRACT REALLY PROVIDED US AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET THAT ADDITIONAL CLARITY- THAT WAS ALSO NOTED BY MISS PETTICOAT WHAT ARE THOSE I'M RESPONSIBILITY SO M. INCREASED PARTICIPATION AND I. E. P. MEETING- WE ALSO HAVE NOTED IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE REGARDING- INCREASING PARENTS ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND AND BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE TRANSITION- SO WE CAN GET THAT. MUCH WE CAN HAVE A MORE INTEREST PROCESS IN THE CONTRACT WHERE WE CAN BUILD ON IT AND THAT'S- HOW WE WERE APPROACHING I'M NOT ONLY THE CASE LOAD RATIO BUT INTENTIONAL- REQUIREMENTS- I AGREE IT'S A GOOD BASE FOR US TO BEGIN WITH ONES HER REGIONAL CENTER BUT WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW UP IF THERE ARE SPECIFIC REGIONAL CENTERS WITH- LARGE POPULATIONS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND WHETHER OR NOT. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE TO BE PROVIDING MORE. ID A SPECIALIST TO THOSE AREAS IF NECESSARY AND WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW UP. BUT DO YOU BELIEVE IT SEEMS THAT YOUR NON ANSWER ON WHY PLACING IT INTO STATUTE IS TO GIVE SOME OF THE FLEXIBILITIES TO THE REGIONAL CENTERS TO IMPLEMENT AS THEY- SEE FIT OF FOR NOT GOING TO PLACE IT AND TO STATUTES AND SO JUST WANT TO. MAKE SURE IS THIS AN ASPIRATIONAL GOAL OR IS THIS ONE WE'RE GOING TO REQUIRE OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS TO COMPLETE THAT- THE CONTRACT CAN GET VERY SPECIFIC AS FAR AS THE EXPECTATION OF THE RATIOS. WE'RE ALSO GOING TO BE MONITORING NOT ONLY CASELOAD RATIOS I'M WE DO KNOW THE REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE A FAIRLY HEAVY LIFT AND- BRING IN ON A NUMBER OF SERVICE COORDINATORS IN THIS NEXT YEAR- ARE PROPOSAL REFLECTS NINE MONTHS WORTH. OF FUNDING THAT'S NOT SO MUCH TO SAY WE WANT THEM TO WAIT BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE WAS INVESTMENT AND- BUDGET ACT TWENTY TWENTY ONE FOR REGIONAL CENTERS TO HAVE REDUCE CASELOADS- IN THE GENERAL POPULATION IF THEY'D BEEN THE REST OF THAT THE CASELOAD- SO WE WILL GET SPECIFIC IN THE CONTRACT AS FAR AS WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE HOW WE'RE GOING TO TRACK IT. AND THEN WE DO HAVE- REPORTING OUT OF WHAT CASELOAD RATIOS ARE IN ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS- THE ADDITIONAL PIECE THAT I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY VALUABLE AS OUR PERFORMANCE CONTRACT. THAT WE'RE ALSO GOING TO BE ABLE TO INCLUDE- ELEMENTS SUCH AS THIS AS TO HOW OUR REGIONAL CENTERS PERFORMING IN A TIMELY WAY IN FILLING THE POSITIONS TO GET THE BENEFIT OF WHAT'S INTENDED. BY REDUCING THESE CASELOAD RATIOS. AND THE OUTCOMES WE EXPECT. I WAS IN. BY WHAT YOU ARE AGAIN ABOUT THE LARK AND- HOW THE NODE TO LOW POS AS WELL AS- THE POSITIVE OUTCOMES AND THE ABILITY FOR MANY OF OUR MONOLINGUALS TO NAVIGATE THE SYSTEMS. AS THAT IS A WAY WE CAN LEAN IN AND HAVE A LENDS TOWARDS EQUITY LOOKING FORWARD. AND WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE WERE- PLACING THAT JUSTIFICATION AND TO. INTO LAW IF POSSIBLE AS I BELIEVE THAT IS HOW WE WILL NEED TO GO FORWARD WHICH IS TO MAKE SURE WERE ADDRESSING OUR COMMUNITY AND ENSURING THEY HAVE. THE RIGHT STAFF AROUND TO SUPPORT. WITH THAT I WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN FOR NOW BUT WOULD LIKE AGAIN AS I DID DURING THE FIRST ITEM TO FOLLOW UP DIRECTOR BARGE MAN BY APRIL EIGHTH IF POSSIBLE WITH MANY OF THE WRITTEN RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS WE HAD HERE TODAY. AS WELL AS A CHANCE TO WORK WITH THE L. F. AND L. A- GOING FORWARD FOR ANY QUESTIONS WE HAVE AS THIS MAY- NEED TO ADJUST THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE BEFORE IF THAT'S AMENABLE TO YOUR DIRECTOR. YEAH WE LOOK FORWARD TO WITH- WITH THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH THAT WE WILL- MOVE ON TO ISSUE THREE WE WILL HAVE SIX PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL OF SUB MINIMUM WAGE PHASE OUT. AND THE WORK ACTIVITY PROGRAM WE WILL BEGIN WITH DIRECTOR PARCHMAN FOLLOWED BY CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR BRIAN WINFIELD. THEN WE WILL HAVE CHRISTOPHER A DEAL AGAIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SONYA PADDOCK WITH THE L. A. O. ERIC ZIGMAN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE GOLDEN. GATE REGIONAL CENTER AND ERIN CARRUTHERS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE STATE COUNCIL OF DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. DIRECTOR BARGE MAN CAN YOU PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YEAH SO WE'VE BEEN- A NUMBER OF FRIENDS BEEN LOOKING AT HOWARD PROVIDING SERVICES IN WHAT SETTING TYPES FOR INDIVIDUALS- AND MUCH OF THIS IS ALSO DRIVEN BASED ON THE- H. C. B. S. THE HOMING COMMUNITY BASED ON SERVICES THE FEDERAL DOLLARS. OUR COMPLIANCE- WE'VE BEEN FOCUSING ON- LARGER SETTING TYPES NOT ONLY FOR A DAY SERVICES BUT ALSO FOR RESIDENTIAL OR ONE OF THOSE SETTINGS THAT MAY NOT BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE NEW FEDERAL RULE FOR COMMUNITY INCLUSION AND CHOICE AND OTHER ELEMENTS THAT. ARE UNDER THE- THEY REQUIREMENTS WHICH ARE REALLY REALLY GREAT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE SERVE- WE WILL PRIORITIZE THERE'S FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY AND EIGHT CBS FUNDING- THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO BE ABLE TO HELP SUPPORT- PROVIDERS IN COMING INTO COMPLIANCE- WE HAVE SEEN A NUMBER OF WORK ACTIVITY PROGRAMS THAT HAVE TRANSITION TO ALTERNATIVE TYPES OF SERVICES- WE'VE ALSO SEEN. BY USING SOME OF THE FUNDS AND ALSO SOME OF THEIR OWN INITIATIVES- BUT WE'VE ALSO SEEN THAT WE HAVE QUITE A FEW- WORKING TOO MANY PROGRAMS. THAT ARE STILL- HAVE NOT DEVELOPED THEIR PLANS OR IT'S NOT REALLY CLEAR HOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE TRANSITIONING I'M INTO COMPLIANCE AND THAT IS THE REASON I'M KIND OF GOING INTO THAT IS BECAUSE MOST OF THE SETTINGS. THAT REALLY ARE WITH SUB MINIMUM WAGE- WE'RE WE PUT THIS FORWARD TO FOLD ONE IS TO REALLY TAKE A LOOK AT HOW CAN WE BUILD A PILOT. THAT CAN BE AN ALTERNATIVE WAY TO LOOK AT PROVIDING- SERVICES AS A TRANSITION KIND OF NAVIGATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL OR FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE IN- WORK ACTIVITY PROGRAMS BUT ALSO BE RESPECTFUL TO THE FACT THAT MANY OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN PARTICIPATING IN THAT WORK ACTIVITY PROGRAMS. HAVE DONE SO FOR TWENTY THIRTY YEARS IN SOME INSTANCES SO WHAT IS THAT PERSON CENTERED APPROACH THAT CAN REALLY. WORK WITH THE INDIVIDUAL AND THEN LOOK AT HOW WE CAN- THINK THROUGH. WHAT IS THE BEST- AND WE LOOK. TO A BEING I A BREATH. OF THE WORK I STATE COUNCIL- THEIR WORK IS A HEAVY LIFT AND WE ARE GOING TO BE THERE- WITH THEM AS FAR AS WHATEVER- DATA OR INFORMATION THAT THAT THEY'RE WORKING ON. I DON'T SEE THIS AS SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO- BE A CONFLICT AT ALL WITH THE WORK WE'RE REALLY HOPING THAT IT WILL BE A COMPLIMENT OR MAYBE ONE OF THE SERVICES. THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED AS- PART OF THE FUTURE THINKING OF THOSE NEXT STEPS- SO WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES TO- FOCUSED ON THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE ON IN THE AGENDA THANK YOU. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- BRIAN WIND CHILL CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES- THE PILOT PROGRAM. WILL BE ESTABLISHED WITH A FRAMEWORK AND REPORTING AND MONITORING OF OUTCOMES IN MIND. WE WILL BE ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS AND THEY STAKEHOLDER GROUP WOULDN'T INCLUDE INDIVIDUALS. WHO RECEIVE FOR CAPTIVITY PROGRAM SERVICES AS WELL AS- FAMILY MEMBERS TO REALLY UNDERSTAND. THE INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR NEEDS AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT BY SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE REGIONAL CENTERS THAT ARE PART OF THE PILOT. WILL BEGIN TO DEVELOP ONE OR MORE SERVICE MODELS AND RECRUITING QUALIFY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND IDENTIFY INTERESTED. CONSUMERS TO THE INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM PLAN PROCESS- DDS WILL MONITOR IMPLEMENTATION REPORT. AN ENCORE ONGOING STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND EVALUATION OF THE SERVICE MODEL THIS COUNCIL ON THE BOTTOM DOESN'T. REALLY THERE'S THAT THREE TO THAT FIRST WE FIND THE TVS PLAZA CRITICAL ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SB SIX THIRTY NINE SOME MINIMUM WAGE MULTI YEAR PHASE OUT PLAN. THE PILOT PROGRAM WILL BE TO CAN COUNSEL. WITH STAKEHOLDERS AS I PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED AND- ONE OF THE STAKEHOLDERS AT THE TABLE WILL OF COURSE BE THE STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AND THEN THIRDLY JUST KEEPING IN MIND THAT THE STATE COUNCIL UNDER NORMAL DISABILITIES HAS A VERY UNIQUE A ROLE IN THIS PROCESS AND DDS HAS ON A DIFFERENT ROLE IN THAT- ANOTHER QUESTION WAS POSED AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THESE SERVICES WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO INDIVIDUALS AND OTHER TYPES OF PROGRAMS- THE PILOT PROGRAM WILL BE DEVELOPED. WITH THE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS AND WORK ACTIVITY PROGRAMS IN MIND AND ALSO FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE EXITING HIGH SCHOOL- HOWEVER AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE WILL CONTINUE TO AND FINALLY REEVALUATE AND IT'S POSSIBLE THAT A SERVICES COULD BE. EXPANDED TO OTHER INDIVIDUALS. I WITH REGARDS TO THE- CHANGES TO THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THE ADMINISTRATION IS OPEN TO CONTINUE DISCUSSION. OF THE PROPOSED TVL AGAIN FIGHTS THE WORKGROUP AND TIMELINE AND HAS A TO PILE IT MAY BE MANAGED THROUGH- DIRECTIVES. OUTCOMES WILL BE IDENTIFIED THROUGH STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT BUT WILL INCLUDE TRACKING INDIVIDUALS PATHWAYS A POST PARTICIPATION TO INCLUDE THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS AND HOW MANY HAVE ACHIEVED COMPETITIVE EMPLOYMENT. AND TO ATTEND HOW MANY HAVE ATTENDED COLLEGE. AND LASTLY A QUESTION ABOUT- IF THE PLAN FROM RATE SAID CREATING A INVEST FOR CREATE CREATING COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT EMPLOYMENT- THE PROVIDER RATE INCREASES WILL ASSIST US SERVICE PROVIDERS IN THE CAPACITY TO CREATE JOBS FOR THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE SERVE. IT'S A NEED FOR MEANS FOR IDENTIFYING AND SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS IN SECURING EMPLOYMENT- THE WORK WE'RE CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN WITH THE EMPLOYMENT GRANTS THAT'S THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS- FORD CREATING PATHWAYS TO EMPLOYMENT- WHICH IS A COLLABORATIVE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION- AND THEN. ON TOP OF THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS- NEW INITIATIVES THIS YEAR FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS THAT GO TO SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SUCCESSFUL IN COMPETITIVE EMPLOYMENT FOR THIRTY DAYS. AND SIX MONTHS AND THEN TWELVE MONTHS THOSE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS HAVE BEEN TEMPORARILY INCREASED- THEY'VE BEEN DOUBLED TO A. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND THREE THOUSAND. AND IN ADDITION- ARE. INTERNSHIP PROGRAM WHERE INDIVIDUALS- EARNS WAGES THROUGH REGIONAL CENTER PURCHASE OF SERVICE- WE ALSO HAVE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS FOR THOSE PROVIDERS TO DEVELOP THOSE PAID INTERNSHIPS- WHERE THEY CAN RECEIVE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS AFTER THIRTY DAYS AND A THOUSAND DOLLARS AFTER SIXTY DAYS. SO THE DEPARTMENT IS VERY COMMITTED TO CONTINUING OUR WORK TO INCREASE COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT FOR THE INDIVIDUALS WE SERVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR CHRISTOPHER O'NEILL'S PERMANENT FINANCE A NO FURTHER INFORMATION TO SHARE ON THIS PRESENTATION. NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM SENATE PADDOCK WITH THE L. A. THANK YOU- DOCTOR IN SENATE WITH THE L. A. O. I'M. UNDERSCORED THIS PROPOSAL DOES A LOT OF MERIT IN THAT THE INDIVIDUALS CURRENTLY SERVED IN WORK ACTIVITY PROGRAMS WE ONLY GOOD ALTERNATIVES I AND REALLY ARE AT RISK OF LOSING EMPLOYMENT ALTOGETHER IF GOOD ALTERNATIVES AREN'T SET UP- YOU KNOW WE WILL POINT OUT THAT IN TERMS OF COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT- RECENT DATA SHOW THAT ONLY ABOUT THIRTEEN POINT FIVE PERCENT. OF INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES- HAVE COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT OR OR MAKE WAGES- AT MY ACTUALLY NOT SURE IF THAT FIGURE INCLUDES- SUB MINIMUM WAGE OR NOT- SO IT'S YOU KNOW THIS IS A CHALLENGING AREA FOR THE DEPARTMENT- AND FOR INDIVIDUALS AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT GOOD ALTERNATIVES RE NEEDED. I'M ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE HAD WAS HOW WELL ALIGNED THIS PROPOSAL WAS WITH- THE EFFORTS OF THE STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AS IT DEVELOPS ITS PLAN- ACCORDING TO SB SIX THIRTY NINE IT SOUNDS LIKE FROM WHAT THE DEPARTMENT JUST SAID- THAT- THE STATE COUNCIL IS INVOLVED IN THE DDS- PROPOSAL TO DEVELOP A PILOT SO THAT'S GOOD WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THOSE EFFORTS ARE COMPLEMENTARY AND NOT DUPLICATIVE. WE'D ALSO POINT OUT THAT BOTH- THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION ALSO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE SORT OF JOB TRAINING IN AND- JOB PREPARATION SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES TO ENTER COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED JOB PLACEMENTS- SO WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT DDS ISN'T SORT OF DUPLICATING- THE SERVICES THAT MIGHT BE PROVIDED TO THESE SAME INDIVIDUALS- THROUGH. THROUGH SERVICES PROVIDED BY THESE OTHER PROGRAMS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU NEXT TO HEAR FROM ERIC ZIGMAN THINKS TO FOR THE GOLDEN GATE REGIONAL. THANK YOU FOR GOOD AFTER HUGS EXECUTIVE GOLDEN GATE REGIONAL CENTER MANY THANKS TO THE COMMITTEE FOR THE INVITATION TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY BEGAN MY SERVICE TO PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES BY ANSWERING AN AD IN A LOCAL PAPER ADVERTISING A POSITION FOR A DIRECT SERVICE STAFF. IN A SHELTERED WORKSHOP. I DID NOT KNOW WHAT A SHELTERED WORKSHOP WAS AND I BELIEVE I DIDN'T HAD NEVER HEARD THE TERM DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. BUT I FOUND A HOME THERE AND IT LAUNCHED ME ON THIS CAREER BUT HAS CREATED SO MUCH MEANING AND PURPOSE IN MY LIFE. SO I STARTED WORKING AS A STAFF MEMBER IN THE WORKSHOP SERVING A HUNDRED AND TEN INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AND EACH OF THEM TAUGHT ME SO VRY MUCH. THE AGENCY I WORK FOR WAS ALSO VERY EARLY ADOPTER OF SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT SERVICES. SO WE SUPPORT ABOUT TWENTY INDIVIDUALS AT THE TIME AND WHAT IS NOW CALLED. COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT IN REGULAR JOBS IN THE COMMUNITY. OVER THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS A LOT HAPPENED. OUR AGENCY EVENTUALLY SUPPORTED THE TRANSITION OF OVER A HUNDRED OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS. FROM THE WORKSHOP INTO COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT. AND WE ENDED UP CLOSING THE WORKSHOP. MUCH OF THE EXPERIENCE INFORMS MY TESTIMONY TODAY. IN TERMS OF SUCCESSFUL WORKSHOP THE COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT TRANSITION HERE IS A FEW THINGS THAT WE LEARNED. WHAT WE LEARNED WAS THAT SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT WORKS VERY WELL AS LONG AS YOU CAN FIND A WAY TO FUND IT AT THAT TIME I LOST A LOT OF MONEY IN THOSE HERE'S- WHAT WE LEARNED IS THAT YOU HAVE TO INVEST IN JOB DEVELOPMENT EXPERTISE BUT A STARKLY AGAIN THAT. HAS NOT BEEN A STRONG ENOUGH FUNDING SOURCE- AS MUCH AS INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES AND SCHOOLS AND OTHERS CAN HELP DEVELOP JOBS BUT ACTUALLY MOVES THE NEEDLE MOVES THE NEEDLE AND MAKES A DIFFERENCE. IS PAID JOB DEVELOPERS WHO CAN BOTH UNDERSTAND THE PEOPLE WE SERVE. AND ALSO SPEAK TO THE BUSINESS INTERESTS OF EMPLOYERS. WHAT WE LEARNED IS THAT JOB COACHES HAVE TO BE WELL TRAINED THEY HAVE TO BE PERSON CENTERED AND ABLE TO WORK VERY INDEPENDENTLY. AND WHAT WE LEARNED IS THAT PERSON CENTERED- PROCESS OF DISCOVERY. OF REALLY UNDERSTANDING EACH INDIVIDUAL'S SKILLS CHALLENGES AND CAREER ASPIRATIONS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. THIS WHOLE TRANSITION PROCESS HAS TO BE PERSON BY PERSON- WHICH MATCHES WELL WITH A LOT OF OUR PERSON CENTRED FCUS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. I KNOW THAT WE WANT THIS TRANSFORMATION FROM SEGREGATED EMPLOYMENT A COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT TO HAPPEN IN A COUPLE OF YEARS BUT WHAT WE LEARNED IN MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT IT TAKES MUCH LONGER. FIVE YEARS WOLD BE AMBITIOUS IN TERMS OF A STATE WIDE TRANSITION SEVEN YEARS WAS MORE REALISTIC I BELIEVE. STATES LIKE OREGON AND MASSACHUSETTS MASSACHUSETTS HOW. MAY HAVE MUCH TO TEACH US ABOUT THE SYSTEMIC TRANSITION AND HOW MUCH TIME IT TAKES. IN TERMS OF THE BUDGET- PROPOSALS AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WHICH WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT HERE ARE MY RECOMMENDATIONS FIRST- CHECK THE NUMBERS THE PROPOSAL TARGETS FOUR THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS IN WORKSHOPS AND THOSE LEAVING SCHOOLS. BUT THE PILOT SHOULD COVER THOSE IN- OTHER PROGRAMS AS WELL IF THEY ARE EARNING SUB MINIMUM WAGE. SECOND WE NEED TO DEMONSTRATE WHAT LEVEL OF JOB DEVELOPER FUNDING IS NEEDED TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE MOVEMENT OF INDIVIDUALS AND A COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT. THIRD MAKE SURE THAT THE PILOTS PROVIDE THE FUNDING AND TRAINING NEEDED FOR REALLY EFFECTIVE JOB COACHING. THAT COACHING FADES OVER TIME SO IT'S A GREAT INVESTMENT OF STATE RESOURCES. AND FOURTH I SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL TO ADD STAFF A DDS FOR THE PURPOSE OF DEVELOPING AND MONITORING THE PILOT BUT WE SHOULD BE REALISTIC. IN TERMS OF TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WE SHOULD FIND RESOURCES WITHIN THE STATE AND WITHIN THE NATION. THAT ARE- ARE ENTITIES THAT HAVE A TRACK RECORD IN DEVELOPING THESE KIND OF CAREER PATH PROGRAMS AND HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN TRANSITION FROM SHELTER TO COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT. ONE OF THE FIRST AND MOST POWERFUL THINGS THAT THOSE HUNDRED AND TEN INDIVIDUALS TAUGHT ME IN THE WORKSHOP LONG AGO WAS THIS. TO SAY YOU HAVE A JOB. AND TO SEE A PAYCHECK COME WITH YOUR NAME ON IT IS A VERY BIG DEAL IN OUR SOCIETY. THEY TAUGHT ME A NEW WAY TO SEE THE IMPACT OF THE DIGNITY OF WORK BOTH IN THEIR WORKSHOP EMPLOYMENT AND LATER. EVEN MORE POWERFULLY WHEN THEY GOT INTO JOBS ON THE OUTSIDE THEY USED TO CALL IT JOBS ON THE OUTSIDE IN THE COMMUNITY. WITH COMPANIES LIKE SAFEWAY ALLSTATE INSURANCE UC SANTA CRUZ AND MANY OTHER EMPLOYERS. AS WE CHAMPION THIS FINAL TRANSITION TO COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT LET'S TRY TO LISTEN MORE EFFECTIVELY AND MORE DEEPLY TO THOSE WE SERVE. AND IF MORE PEOPLE THAT. EXPERIENCE OF THE DIGNITY OF WORK. ALL HAPPY TO TAKE. AND HOPES. A MORE ROBUST- WRITTEN TESTIMONY TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM ERIN CARRUTHERS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE STATE COUNCIL OF DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. THANK YOU DR RAMBLING COMMITTEE MEMBERS AMERICA CARRUTHERS EXECUTRIX TOOK THE STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES- PAST THE GOVERNOR SIGNED LAST YEAR'S IN A GARAGE WAS SB SIX THREE NINE- THANK YOU YOU SENT OUT A PROPER ENDING WHAT REALLY ISN'T EXPLOITATIVE PROCESS START OFF WITH SOMETHING THAT WAS SEEN AS BEST PRACTICE- IT GIVEN PROGRESSIVE PRACTICE BUT AS WE'VE INVOLVED AND- GROWN AND WHAT WE KNOW IS THE BEST WAY TO. PEOPLE TO SUCCEED I HOPE WE CAN REALIZE IT WAS TIME FOR THIS PROGRAM OF PAYING PEOPLE LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE FOR THEIR WORK- DIGNITY IN THEIR EFFORT TO END THANK YOU FOR PASSING THAT BILL THE BILL ALSO REQUIRED THE STATE COUNCIL'S MEMBERS. OTHERS SPEAKERS OF TALK ABOUT TO CONVENE STAKEHOLDERS TO CREATE AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN- LOOKING AT BEST PRACTICES A POLICY HOW TURNED ITS- OUT OPTIONS MAKING SURE THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL IS ABLE TO TRANSITION- INTO THEIR NEXT BEST PRACTICE WHAT THEY WANT. THAT REPORT IS DUE TO YOU. JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY. WE'RE BEGINNING NEXT PROCESS NOW. THIS DDS REQUEST FOR IT AS REALLY WELL FROM. IT WOULD COME AN OP- AS PEOPLE LEAVE. THE SHELTER WORKS- TRANSITIONING KEEP OUT IT'S GOING TO BE ALL HIGH ON CROSS. ONE THAT THIS COUNCIL TO EXPERIENCE. AND APPLAUD THE MINISTER CONQUER COMMITTEE TO. BUILDING AN ALTAR. SB SIX THOUGH I'D SAY THAT'S A CLEAR NAY. OF WHAT THE PROPOSED IS AND IT CAN SIX THREE AND BE DEVELOPED TO INCLUDE IT. I'D ALSO SUGGEST CLARIFYING THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS- IF THIS PROPOSAL IS ADOPTED THERE WOULD BE TO STAKEHOLDER PROCESS SEASON LIKELY WITH MANY OF THE SAME ACTUAL INDIVIDUALS BOTH WORKING TO PHASE OUT SEVEN WAGE IN DIFFERENT WAYS. TO BREAK IT OUT THE STATE COUNCIL SIX THIRTY NINE PROCESSES BROUGHT. IT LOOKS GOOD MANY ASPECTS- AND MANY PROGRAMS AND MANY OPTIONS THAT'S A CASE OF SOMETHING WHICH FIFTY S. PROCESS DEVELOPS- ONE IMPORTANT AND. ONE VERY NEEDED OPTION. THIS COUNCIL SIX THIRTY NINE STATE PROCESS READS IN EMPLOYMENT PLAN IT EDS PROCESS RESULTS IN DEVELOPING A NEW PROGRAM- SOMEBODY'S ASKED ME HEARING DO YOU THINK THIS THE- PROPOSAL SORT OF PUTS THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE. I DON'T- ONE PROCESS. DOESN'T NEED TO WAIT FOR THE OTHER BOTH CAN HAPPEN CONCURRENTLY. BUT WITH GOOD CONNECTIONS SO I'D RECOMMEND THAT THE STATE COUNCIL BE IDENTIFIED AS CO LEAD IN THE THIRTY S. PROCESS UNDER THIS PROPOSAL I'M AS A WAY TO ENSURE MAXIMUM COORDINATION. AND OF COURSE WE WOULD ENSURE THAT THE PROCESS INCLUDES PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE- THAT HAVE BEEN PAID. SUB MINIMUM WAGE FOR THEIR WORK. LASTLY THE STATE COUNCIL RECOMMENDS THAT WHAT'S DEVELOPED UNDER THIS PROGRAM- BE BUILT ON EVIDENCE BASED BEST PRACTICES. FROM OTHER STATES TRANSACTION PEOPLE OUT OF SUB MINIMUM WAGE I WE CAN LEARN A LOT FROM OTHERS WHO LED THE WAY. SO IN CLOSING THE STATE COUNCIL WAS COMMITTED. I TO THE SHARED POLICY CALLED THE LEGISLATURE THE- TO PHASE OUT SEVEN WAGE FOR MEMBERS. FOR INDIVIDUALS AND PEOPLE INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES SMOOTHLY. AND WITH ESTABLISH CONTACTS WITH PEOPLE. SIR THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY I WILL NOW BRING UP TO THE TO SEE IF ANY. HAVE QUESTION WE WILL BEGIN THE SAME MATHIS. THANK YOU THAT WE'RE TARGETING. FOUR THOUSAND- NEAR STUDENTS WITH ID THEY THAT AS THEY'RE GETTING OUT LOOKING AT THAT AS A TARGET BUT REALLY MY QUESTION IS WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR IT D. POPULATION THAT. WAS WORKING. ON THAT THIS IS AFFECTING TO HAVE A NUMBER ON THAT BECAUSE OUT WHAT WHAT I'M HEARING BACK IS THAT IT'S ABOUT FOURTEEN PERCENT. ON SO WHAT IS THAT NUMBER DO WE HAVE THAT FROM THE DEPARTMENT- AND WHAT IS THAT LOOK LIKE AND I'LL START THERE. THE CORRECT APARTMENT YES THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS- WHEN WE HAVE THE NUMBER AND I DON'T APOLOGIZE I DON'T HAVE- ALL THAT THAT THE DATA IN FRONT OF ME BUT WE CAN- PROVIDE IT- HE ESTIMATE WAS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ACTIVE IN WORKING TIVITY PROGRAMS- AND THEN ALSO AN ASSUMPTION OF SOME INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD BE LEAVING- HIGH SCHOOL AND OPTING FOR THIS AS AN OPTION. AS COMPARED TO OTHER SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE- SO WITH THE PILOT IT REALLY HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON A SPECIFIED- GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE- PARTICIPATING IN WORK ACTIVITY PROGRAMS. SO IT IS A SMALL PERCENTAGE- WE HAVE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT RIGHT AND WORK ACTIVITY PROGRAM PARTICIPATION OVER THE YEARS- SO THAT NUMBER. WHERE'S MAYBE THREE FOUR FIVE YEARS AGO WOULD HAVE BEEN DOUBLED- IT HAS DEFINITELY. DECREASED OVER TIME. SO THERE'S ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT WILL BE HELPFUL WERE HAPPY TO PROVIDE IT. OKAY BECAUSE THE THOSE ARE NUMBERS THAT ARE GOING TO BE IMPORTANT AND ALSO YOU KNOW WITH THE DECREASE WE ALL KNOW THE LAST COUPLE YEARS THERE'S BEEN A HUGE DECREASE IN EMPLOYMENT PERIOD DUE TO THE- EPIDEMIC- BUT WE'RE DEFINITELY GONNA NEED THAT BREAK DOWN WITHIN THE POPULATION. NO BECAUSE WE WILL WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT. THE FEDERAL OUR STANDARDS ARE FOR SUB PAY VERSUS WHAT WE JUST PASSED RECENTLY. IN THE OVERLAPS THERE IT'S VERY CONCERNING- TO HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE WORKING WHO HAD THE DIGNITY OF BEING ABLE TO MAKE A PAYCHECK. IN NOW- ARE NO LONGER ABLE TO DO THAT. SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT LETTING ANYBODY SLIDE IN ANY GAPS IN IN CREATING- THE A PLACE WHERE SOMEBODY DID HAVE THE ABILITY TO WORK. IN NOW DUE TO SOMETHING WE CHANGES LEGISLATURE ERRORS. ARE FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS AND LOOSE THAT THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO. THANK YOU I'M WHEN THIS BILL CAME US- ON THE FLOOR LST YEAR ONE OF MY CONCERNS THAT WE ARE EXPERT OR AT LEAST I EXPRESS WAS THEM THE ABILITY FOR SOME OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS TO MAINTAIN THE LEVEL OF EMPLOYMENT AND TO MISTER MATHIS IS- QUESTION DO WE HAVE AN IDEA OF HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED CURRENTLY- OR WHAT THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS FOR THAT POPULATION SO THAT'S ONE AND NUMBER TWO- MY FEAR WAS AND I DON'T KNOW THIS AND THIS IS A QUESTION. MY FEAR WAS THAT A LOT OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS WERE GOING TO PAY THE MINIMUM WAGE BUT THEN THE HOURS AGO THEY ARE GOING TO BE CUT WHICH EALLY DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE- IN TERMS OF MORE INCOME FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL- TWO COULD WE HAVE DATA ON THAT AS WELL AS THE HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE TRANSITIONED. INTO MORE PAY BUT LESS WORK. OR HOURS OF WORK. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO- I HATE IT IS. VERY CONCERNING AS- YOUR HEARING AND OTHERS HAVESHARED ABOUT THE DECREASE AND COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT WITH PAID JOBS. I'M IT HAS DEFINITELY DECREASED- AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC IN ADDITION TO THE- COMPETITIVE WAGES WE ALSO SAW A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE AND PART OF THIS IS THAT A TOTAL WEEK WE STILL HAVE TO KIND OF DRILL INTO SOME OF THE DATA. IS THAT WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT OUR DATA FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE- INCOME PAID- PAID JOBS. THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS HAS GONE DOWN. BUT THE AVERAGE WAGE HAS GONE UP. AND WHILE WITHOUT KIND OF DRILLING INTO IT SOME OF THAT ASSUMPTION IS THAT. THOSE THAT WERE WITHIN EVEN SUB MINIMUM WAGE OVER THE PANDEMIC LIKE LIKELY HAD LOST SOME OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. SO WE DO WALDRON INCIDENTS THAT WERE WORKING ON AT DDS THAT I'VE I'M CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO SPEAK FOR- MR CROWTHER SON ON THE STATE COUNCIL BUT- THE INITIAL DOES THAT. REALLY DO A LIFE TOGETHER ARE IMPORTANT YOU KNOW AS WE'RE DEVELOPING RESOURCES FOR AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT CAN BE ALTERNATIVES AND STILL USE IN OUR FIFTEEN MILLION TO SUPPORT PROVIDERS TO TRANSITION. LOOKING AT OUR EMPLOYMENT INITIATIVES THAT WERE INTRODUCED LAST YEAR AND IS SUPPORTING STATE COUNCIL ON THEIR EFFORT. TO REALLY DRILL INTO MORE OF THE- THE ISSUES AND HOW WE CAN ADDRESS THE CONCERNS. AND LIKE I SAID A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS IN WORK ACTIVITY PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN PARTICIPATING FOR SO MANY YEARS- AND WE DO NEED TO BE CAREFUL AND THOUGHTFUL. AS WE APPROACH THIS AGENCIES IN IN MY DAY AND I WENT TO VISIT SEVERAL OF THEM ABILITY TO- FOR SOME OF THOSE FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO JUST GO TO A JOB THEY WERE SO PROUD AND SO EXCITED TO HAVE THIS JOB UNTIL MY CONCERN AGAIN. ADDRESSED ON TO THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL WAS THAT YOU KNOW IF WE'RE GOING TO TRANSITION AND YES WE'RE GOING TO SUPPORT THESE ORGANIZATIONS WITHOUT MONEY NOW BUT THEN WHAT HAPPENS AFTERWARDS. IN ARE WE GOING TO YOU KNOW PRETEND THAT IT DOESN'T EXIST AND YOU KNOW A LOT OF THOSE FOLKS. YES THEY NEED OBVIOUSLY THEY WANTED TO WORK BUT THE PRIDE THAT I SAW IN THEIR FACES JUST THE FACT THAT THEY WERE AT WORK EVERY DAY THAT HELPS WITH SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL- WELL BEING BECAUSE NOW THEY HAVE AN A PURPOSE RIGHT. TO WEAR WHERE THEY'RE GETTING UP EVERY MORNING TO GO SO I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT YOU KNOW ANY. NEGATIVE EFFECTS TO THIS GOAL I WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST THAT YOU KEEP US APPRAISED AND REALLY FOLLOW THOSE NUMBERS AND GIVE US THE DATA YOU KNOW AS QUICKLY AS YOU HAVE THEM AND AS ACCURATELY AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE- IF WE NEED TO CHANGE SOMETHING I THINK. YOU KNOW THE SOONER THE BETTER AGAIN THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH WE'RE NOT BUILDING CARS WERE WORD THESE ARE ACTUAL LIVES THAT WERE AFFECTING AND IF WE NEED TO CHANGE SOMETHING IMMEDIATELY THEN. THAT NEEDS TO BE TOLD TO US SO THAT WE CAN DO YOU KNOW REMEDY THE SITUATION AND IF IT'S WORKING THAT WOULD BE GEAT AS WELL IF IT'S WORKING THEN THAT WOULD BE AMAZING. SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE ON THE PATH BUT EITHER WAY WE I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO OUTSIDE YOU HATE TO SEE MY PEOPLE IT'S THE ROLE IN. A GROUP IN MY AREA THEY WERE JUST SO PROUD AND SO AMAZING YOU KNOW TO GO AND VISIT AND THEN THEY WANTED TO SHOW ME EVERYTHING AND- I DON'T WANT TO LOSE THAT. AND REALLY OVER SOMETHING THAT WE CAN FIX AB IF WE KNOW WHAT IS- WHAT WE'RE FIXING RIGHT AND SO PLEASE KEEP US IN THE LOOP MAKE SURE THAT THE DATA IS ACCURATE AND KEEP US- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE BUT- EXPECTATIONS YOU. AS FAR AS DAY. IS IF YOU CAN GET IT AS A AS- OFTEN AS- I THINK THAT WOULD HELP US SO THAT WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT- AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU. WILL HAVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER MATHIS AYE AYE MEMBER MENTIONED FOR THE MEMBERS ON THE BOARD PAGE SIXTEEN OF THE AGENDA FROM THE L. A. I'LL- SHOW SOME OF. THE FIGURES FOR EMPLOYMENT FOR THE LAST COUPLE YEARS. BUT AGREED THE NEED FOR DATA IS IMPORTANT ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENEFITS THAT THE DATA IS NOT QUITE EXACT- BACK TO YOU KNOW YOU'RE WE'RE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION I REMEMBER A FEW YEARS AGO EVEN GOING WITH THE DIRECT WE WENT ON A GREAT TORE DOWN THE COSTA MESA. WITH THROUGH A LOT OF THESE PROGRAM SAW A LOT OF REALLY GOOD THINGS ARE HAPPENING- BEFORE THE RECENT LEGISLATION. AND YOU KNOW I I'VE GOT TO ASK YOU KNOW WE CANNOT IMPROVE THESE NUMBERS. WHAT IS THE FALLBACK PLAN. WHAT ARE WE DOING TO ENSURE THAT THIS POPULATION IS VERY VERY FRAGILE POPULATION AGAIN IS NOT GOING TO FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS. BECAUSE SOMETIMES LEGISLATION IS NOT THE BEST. SOMETIMES YOU KNOW WE MOVE FORWARD AND THEN WE GOT TO TAKE TWO STEPS BACK SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE IT IS WE'RE GOING THROUGH THIS- ALL THINGS ARE BEING CONSIDERED BECAUSE WE CAN'T RUSH INTO THIS AND EXPECT THE ECONOMIC SECTOR YOU KNOW THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO SOCIAL COVERS POSSIBILITIES YES BOY THROUGH THE PANDEMIC THROUGH EVERYTHING ELSE WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS POPULATION ISN'T BEING. IT IS IN A LOSE OUT. BECAUSE OF GOOD INTENTIONS. I'D LIKE TO ADD ON TO THE QUESTION IF I MAY BOTH FOR- THE DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS FOR THE STATE COUNCIL. I BELIEVE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US THAT FAIL SAFE PLANS TO ENSURE THAT. THOSE WHO CURRENTLY ARE EMPLOYED THROUGH THE WORK ACTIVITY PROGRAMS OR OTHER SETTINGS. YOU WILL NOT LOSE EMPLOYMENT ALTOGETHER THROUGH THE PENDING CHANGE I SHARE THE CONCERN THAT THE L. A. O. HAS AND WOULD LIKE TO HEAR WHAT THE PLANNING IS AROUND THIS AND WHAT CAN BE DONE TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE POSITIVE OUTCOMES. FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO MIGHT BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. YEAH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS- WE WERE HAPPY TO WORK ON AND- ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BUT ALSO AT THE SAME TIME MAKING SURE THAT- OUR STAKE HOLDERS ARE- PROVIDING THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. AS WELL AS FAR AS WHAT ARE THE OTHER ALTERNATIVES THAT A PLAN THAT WILL BE ABLE TO HELP SUPPORT STATE COUNCIL WITH. IS LIKELY GOING TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY WHAT ARE THOSE BARRIERS TO ADDRESS EMPLOYMENT YOU KNOW THE WORK THAT- MISTER WHEN FILLED IS DOING WITH HIS WORKGROUP UNEMPLOYMENT IS ALSO REALLY. ADDRESSING THIS THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE IT'S A PRIORITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT- TO LOOK AT OPPORTUNITIES FOR EMPLOYMENT- AND I SHARE CONCERNS ABOUT WHENEVER WE ARE TRANSITIONING OUT OF. A SERVICE A DELIVERY THAT IS CHANGING WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL- THIS IS NOT I'M I'M NOT GONNA SAY IT'S GOING TO BE EASY AT ALL BUT WE ARE HIGHLY SENSITIVE WE CLOSE DEVELOPMENTAL SECTORS THAT WAS A VERY SENSITIVE- TRANSITION FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT WE HAD TO BE VERY. MINDFUL AND LISTEN TO THOSE SELF ADVOCATES AND- REALLY TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS THAT SAFETY NET TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE'RE NOT. YOU KNOW. PUTTING PEOPLE ONLY AT RISK BUT MAYBE NOT HAVING THE CHOICES IN OUR LIFE SO APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS ABOUT FORWARD TO HAVING FURTHER DISCUSSIONS. I WAS HOPING TO BRING IN ERRANT. WITH THE STATE COUNCIL- FOR ANY COMMON YOU MAY HAVE THIS QUESTION AS WELL. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR ECHOING DEPARTMENTS COMMENTS REGARDING CHOICE- I'D INVITE- EXPANDING THE VIEW OF WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN IN- ONE PROGRAM. AT A SHELTERED WORKSHOP- WE CALL IT JOB BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE GETTING PAID IT BUT SOMETIMES IT'S TWO DOLLARS AN HOUR- IS THAT REALLY A JOB. WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN NEXT IS AS- MR SIEGMAN POINTED OUT THAT THERE IS IN THE PROCESS WE'RE WORKING WITH. EACH PERSON PERSON BY PERSON FIFTY NOT WHAT IS IT MAY WANT TO HAPPEN NEXT WHAT THEY WANT FOR THEIR LIVES. AND THEN FINDING THE BEST MATCH FOR. FOR WHAT THEY WANT SIR COULD BE VOLUNTEER COULD BE EDUCATION ACT COULD BE ANOTHER JOB- IT COULD BE A VARIETY OF THINGS. AND THAT'S PART OF OUR STAKEHOLDER PROCESS IS TO IDENTIFY ALL THOSE. PUSH THOSE OUT IN MAKE SURE THEY'RE STREAMLINED EFFICIENT SUPPORTED WEIGHTS- TO CERTAIN PEOPLE. AND TEN THEIR NEXT BEST DAY. I BELIEVE WOULD HEARING FROM MOST OF US ON THE DÍAS IS- IN AND- WITH THE DIRECTION THAT BOTH A C. D. D. THE DEPARTMENT RE MOVING BUT SIMPLY THAT WE WANNA. MEASURE TWICE AND CUT ONCE THAT WE WANT TO GET THIS DONE RIGHT WITHOUT ADVERSELY IMPACTING PEOPLE AND WOOD- LOOK FORWARD. TO HOPEFULLY LEARNING SOME LESSONS FROM OTHER STATES WHO HAVE MADE THIS TRANSITION AND LOOK TOWARDS SOME OF THEIR TIME LINES TO INFORM US ON- HOW QUICKLY WE CAN MAKE AND- IMPLEMENT SOME OF THESE TRANSITIONS AND SO- WITH THAT WE WILL. I THANK VERY MUCH ALL THE PANELISTS FOR ISSUE THREE AND WE WILL MOVE NOW ON TO ISSUE FOR. WHICH IS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL COMMUNICATION ASSESSMENTS FOR CONSUMERS WHO ARE TOUGH. WE WILL HAVE FIVE PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL NANCY BARGE MAN THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. BRIAN WINFIELD CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. CHRISTOPHER ARE NEIL WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SONYA PADDOCK WITH THE L. A. L. AND LISA KLEIN BOB EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE REGIONAL CENTER AT THE EAST BAY. LET US BEGIN WITH DIRECTOR PARCHMENT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- SOLD AS BRIEFLY SHARE WITH YOU- THE PROPOSAL- THAT WE HAVE WORDS CORRECTLY OUTLINED ON PAGE SEVENTEEN AND THE AGENDA TODAY- THAT WE ARE REQUESTING- FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS THE FUNDING FOR ASSESSMENTS THIS BUILDS UPON THE INITIATIVES THAT WE HAVE PUT FORWARD. ON- BUILDING HOW TO RE GOING TO BE ADDRESSING SUPPORTS THEN- SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE THAT AND OUR REGIONAL CENTER CONSUMERS. REGIONAL CENTERS ARE HIRING THEY'RE JUST SERVICES SPECIALIST ON DDS ISN'T THE LAST KIND OF PHASE SAID HIRING ARTISTS SERVICES SPECIALIST- AND SO BUILDING ON ADDITIONAL INITIATIVES- WE ARE- MAKE IT A REQUEST TO ADD TO- WHAT WE ALREADY HAD FOR- AND PRIOR INITIATIVES BUT FUNDING FOR THESE ASSESSMENTS AND MR WINFIELD GOING TO WALK YOU THROUGH THE PROPOSAL THE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THE PROPOSAL ON DEAN AFTER THE FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS WILL BE USED TO SECURE THE SERVICES OF ASSESSORS. TO DEVELOP OR IDENTIFY ASSESSMENT TOOLS CAN PERFORM COMMUNICATIONS ASSESSMENTS FOR INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY REGIONAL CENTERS WHO ARE DEAF. OF THE COMMUNICATION ASSESSMENTS WILL INFORM BOX LANDING TEAM TO DETERMINE THE TYPES OF SERVICES AND SUPPORTS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE INDIVIDUAL. PROGRAM PLAN AND OBTAINED THROUGH EITHER REGIONAL CENTER FUNDING FOR A FEW OTHER AGENCIES. OF THE FUNDING AMOUNT REFLECTS THE APPROXIMATE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS. WHO WILL REQUIRE AND SHE'S TO HAVE A COMMUNICATION ASSESSMENT- AND THAT'S MULTIPLE AND BY AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS PER ASSESSMENT. AND THEN THERE'S ALSO FUNDING FOR SECURITY ASSESSORS AND DEVELOPING OR ADAPTING THE ASSESSMENT TOOLS. A DDS- IS CREATING A STEERING COMMITTEE AND THE STEERING COMMITTEE WILL BE COMPRISED OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DEAF. OF FAMILY MEMBERS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DEAF. AT SERVICE PROVIDERS WHO SPECIALIZE IN PROVIDING SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DEAF. ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL. SERVICES AMONG OTHERS. OF THE- PLAN AND TIMELINE AS OF OUR MAN POINTED OUT OF CENTERS THE DEPARTMENT ARE WELL UNDER WAY WITH REGARDS TO- RECRUITING THAT DEAF SERVICES SPECIALIST AND WITH THAT WILL CREATE MORE OF A COORDINATED STATEWIDE EFFORT- WERE ALSO IN THE MIDDLE OF VERIFYING CONSUMER DATA TO. ENSURE THAT E HAVE GOOD- DATA INTEGRITY WITH REGARDS TO THE NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WHO ARE DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING. AND WE ALSO HAVE BEEN RESEARCHING ASSESSORS AND ASSESSMENT TOOLS AND OTHER WORK TO ACCOMPLISH OUR ULTIMATE GOAL. WE ANTICIPATE ASSESSMENTS WILL BEGIN IN THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO- AND REGIONAL CENTERS ALSO ENGAGED IN DEVELOPING NEEDED RESOURCES WHICH IS A CRITICAL PIECE TO THAT MEETING THE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DEATH- AND THE WORK PROCESS IS WILL EVOLVE AS WE CONTINUE TO LEARN AND GAIN ADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE IN THIS AREA. OTHER QUESTION IS ASKED WHY THIS FUNDING IS A ONE TIME AND NOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED ASSESSMENTS. AFTER THE ONE TIME FUNDING- SO THE ONE TIME FUNDING WILL ASSIST US IN THE- THIS INITIAL WORK OF OBTAINING ASSESSMENTS FOR- EVERYONE WHO. IS DEAF AND ONCE THE ASSESSMENT THAT WILL BE PART OF THE PLANNING TEAM PROCESS- BUT IN THE OUT YEARS REGIONAL CENTERS WILL USE THEIR PURCHASE A SERVICE FUNDING TO UPDATE THOSE INITIAL ASSESSMENTS. AND FOR ASSESSMENT OF NEW INDIVIDUALS WHO COME INTO THE REGIONAL CENTER WHERE THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO REGION AGENT NEEDED A COMMUNICATION ASSESSMENT. FOLLOWING THE- COMPLETION OF THE ASSESSMENT ALREADY MENTIONED THIS INFORMATION WILL THEN BE USED BY EACH CONSUMERS PLANNING TEAM- TO DETERMINE- THE TYPES AND AMOUNTS OF SERVICES THAT THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS. OF THE TYPES OF SUPPORTS THAT THE PERSON NEEDS TO ACCESS THOSE SERVICES- THIS COULD RESULT IN PROGRAMMATIC CHANGES IT COULD BE ALTERATIONS AND SERVICES OR THE WAY IN WHICH AND TO RECEIVE THOSE SERVICES. OR IT COULD ALSO RESULT IN ADDITIONAL SERVICES FOR THE INDIVIDUAL. THE QUESTION WAS ASKED ABOUT COM. THE ADMINISTRATION BEING MEAN BEING AMENABLE TO CHANGES TO THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE- THE ADMINISTRATION IS OPEN TO CONTINUE DISCUSSION ABOUT TRIPLE LANGUAGE HOWEVER NO STATUTORY AMENDMENTS WERE IDENTIFIED AS NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT THE CURRENT PROPOSAL. THANK YOU. NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- CHRISTOPHER O'NEILL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE HAVE NO FURTHER INFORMATION TO SHARE ON THIS ITEM. NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM SONYA PADDOCK WITH THE L. L. THANK YOU SONYA PEDIGREE- FROM THE L. A- THIS PROPOSAL IS ANOTHER ONE THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND THE PROPOSAL AS IT WAS WRITTEN LACKED A LOT OF DETAIL BUT SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE HAD ABOUT IT- MISTER MISTER WINFIELD- JUST WAS ABLE TO ADDRESS SUCH AS- HOW THE FUNDING AMOUNT WAS DETERMINED- WHAT THE TIME LINE WOULD BE. HOW PEOPLE IN THE FUTURE WOULD BE SERVED GIVEN THAT THIS IS ONE TIME FUNDING- WHETHER THE DEPARTMENT IS CONSIDERING THE TYPES OF PROGRAMMATIC CHANGES THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED GOING FORWARD TO BETTER SERVE INDIVIDUALS SO I WITH THAT I- I DON'T HAVE ANY FURTHER COMMENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM LISA KLEINBERG EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE REGIONAL CENTER OF THE EAST BAY. THANK YOU CHAIR AROUND BLOODY COMMITTEE MEMBERS- MY NAME IS LISA CLIMB UP AND ON THE SECOND DIRECTOR I REGIONAL CENTER OF THE EAST BAY WE CURRENTLY SERVE OVER SIX HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS WHO IDENTIFY AS STAFF ARE BORED OF HEARING. IT'S A DIVERSE POPULATION INCLUDES MANY WHO USE AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE BUT ALSO OTHER METHODS OF COMMUNICATION. MOST COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES FOR THIS GROUP OF ADULTS WERE SAVAGED FOR THEM. DURING EITHER THEIR YEARS IN EDUCATION AND THEN THEY ARE READ OVER TO THEIR ADULT LIVES OR REGIONAL CENTER HAS HAD A LONG COMMITMENT HAVING CASE MANAGERS WHO ARE FLUENT IN ASL AS WELL AS WHO HAVE LIVED EXPERIENCES IN THE DEAF COMMUNITY. WE'RE ALSO GLAD TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PROMOTED STAFF TO THE RECENTLY FUNDED DEBT SPECIALIST POSITION WILL BE INVALUABLE IN ASSURING THAT WE CAN CONNECT PEOPLE TO RESOURCES AS- WELL AS DEVELOPING THAT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT WILL BE IDENTIFIED THROUGH THESE TYPE OF ASSESSMENT. DISINVESTMENT WILL PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF EACH PERSON SOME OF WHO MAY NEVER HAVE HAD SUCH AN ASSESSMENT OR HAVEN'T HAD SUCH AN ASSESSMENT AND- DEFINE WHAT THE REGION IS RICH IN RESOURCES AND HAS A LARGE DEAF COMMUNITY. THERE IS A NETWORK OF PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH AN EXPERT AT SERVING I'M DEFINITELY VIGILS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. OF MOST IMPORTANT WILL BE OF MOST IMPORTANCE WILL BE IDENTIFYING HE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF AN ASSESSMENT INCLUDING THE ASSESSMENT TOOLS AND THE QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPERTISE. THAT ARE REQUIRED TO ASSESS INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DEAF PLUS INDIVIDUALS MAY ALSO HAVE ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES INCLUDING PHYSICAL DISABILITIES VISUAL IMPAIRMENTS AND OTHER CO OCCURRING. UNCONCERNED WE. ALSO HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY NOT YOU. AS BUT RATHER ANOTHER SONG LINK OR CAN YOU. STRATEGY WHAT FUNDING. THE TO IS. FOR ALL THESE INDIVIDUALS BEING SERVED AND TO DEVELOP THE RESOURCES FOR SUCH ASSESSMENT IN THE OUT YEARS WE WILL CONTINUE TO COMPLETE ASSESSMENT. AS NEW PEOPLE ENTERED SERVICES AS WELL AS WHEN CHANGES AND NEEDS AND CIRCUMSTANCES NECESSITATED THAT CONDUCTING THESE ASSESSMENTS IN A ONE TIME WAY WILL HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF A LARGE SCALE IDENTIFICATION OF WHERE THERE ARE SYSTEM GAPS IN SERVICE AVAILABILITY. FOR THIS COMMUNITY IN OUR AREA WHILE WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PROVIDERS WHO SERVE THIS COMMUNITY WE MUST EXPECTED THIS INVESTMENT WILL IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL NEEDS FOR SERVICES THAT WE MAY NOT CURRENTLY KNOW ABOUT. OUR. HAVE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. SOME AREAS THE MAY NEED TO BE DEVELOPED INCLUDE ADDITIONAL TRAINING FOR SUPPORT STAFF- THAT WILL NEED TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE DAY. THERE MAY ALSO BE A NEED TO IDENTIFY WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO INDIVIDUALS IN TERMS OF THEIR INCLUSION IN THE DEAF COMMUNITY AS WELL AS IN OTHER ARENAS INCLUDING EMPLOYMENT. ADDITIONAL SUPPORT STAFF WHO ARE FLUENT IN ASL AND OTHER COMMUNICATION METHODS MAY NEED TO BE RECRUITED THE DEFAULT OF A STIPEND FOR BILINGUAL STAFF WHICH IS- OCCURRING AS PART OF THE RATE IMPLEMENTATION. AND SOME OTHER INITIATIVES WILL BE HELPFUL TO THIS EFFORT I EXPECT THAT WE WILL ALSO NEED TO CONNECT WITH AND HAVE EXPERTISE IN TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN BE USED TO SUPPORT INCLUSION. AND INDEPENDENCE THE PLANNING FOR AND FUNDING OF COMMUNICATION ASSESSMENT IS A GREAT BEGINNING THERE WILL ALSO NEED TO BE AN ONGOING COMMITMENT TO SUPPORTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RIGHT SERVICES. ARE IDENTIFIED THROUGH THIS PROCESS- THANK YOU FOR ON LISTENING AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DENTIST TO SEE IF ANY MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS. SOON NONDA I WILL KEEP IT WITH THE CHAIR AND MAKE A COMMENT- I REALLY APPRECIATED- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR KLEINBURG TALKING ABOUT THE SYSTEMS GAPS FOR THE COMMUNITY THAT CAN BE IDENTIFIED THROUGH THIS ASSESSMENT AND- LOOK FORWARD TO RECEIVING THAT INFORMATION. AND MAKE APPROPRIATE BUDGET DECISIONS IN THE FUTURE. BUT AS I DID UNDER ISSUE ONE I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE TO DRAW A PARALLEL HERE WITH OUR BLIND COMMUNITY AND THE NEED FOR US TO DO. SIMILAR ASSESSMENTS TO IDENTIFY ANY SYSTEMS GAPS THAT MAY EXIST WITHIN THAT COMMUNITY. AS I BELIEVE WE SHOULD. HAVE PARITY AND TO BELIEVE BUT IN FOR US TO COMPLETE THESE US- SOON AS WE CAN AND SO I- THANKS VERY MUCH ALL THE PANELISTS ON THIS AND- LOOK FORWARD TO. A CONTINUED DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ISSUE FIVE WHERE WE WILL HAVE TEN PRESENTERS THIS IS ON THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES WORK FORCE AND RATE STUDY IMPLEMENTATION. INCLUDING PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES WE WILL BEGIN WITH BRIAN WINFIELD CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR. SERVING CAR WHO'S THE CHIEF DATA ANALYTICS AND STRATEGY FOR DDS JIM KNIGHT DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR DDS. CHRISTOPHER I'D KNEEL WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SONYA PADDOCK WITH THE L. A. O. JORDAN LINDSAY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ARC AND YOU SEE P. CALIFORNIA COLLABORATION. JUDY MARC PRESIDENT FOR DISABILITY VOICES UNITED. BBM HAN SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH ID DE PRACTICE DISABILITIES RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. MARK MELANSON EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY LIVING THAT WORK MARC CLAUS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. FOR THE SAN DIEGO REGIONAL CENTER. IF WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO EXPRESS MY INTEREST AS TO WHETHER IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RATE STUDY CAN. OR SHOULD BE ACCELERATED. THE BURN RATE STUDY WHICH WAS COMPLETED IN TWENTY WAS COMPLETED IN TWENTY NINETEEN. SINCE THEN THE KOPET NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR LIVES INCLUDED INCREASING INCREASES TO OUR COST OF LIVING. TO THIS END I WILL BE REQUESTING AN ADDENDUM TO THE RATE STUDY TO EXAMINE WHETHER THE PROPOSED IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE IS SUFFICIENT TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS IN A POST KOPET NINETEEN WORLD. LET US PLEASE BEGIN WITH MR WINFIELD WHEN YOU ARE READY ALL. HI MISTER CHAIR OF THE JIM MY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES AND HOPE YOU DON'T MIND UP ALL WILL BE TOUGH FOR THE DEPARTMENT ON THE ISSUE. SO CERTAINLY RECOGNIZED THE NOT ONLY THE MAGNITUDE BUT ALSO THE SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANCE OF THE INVESTMENT. IN RATE REFORM AND- OTHER WORK FOR THE STATED GOAL OF THE ENHANCING CONSUMER EXPERIENCE. EQUITY QUALITY AND OUTCOMES AND WITH THE MEDICATION THE BILL. REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE ENOUGH STAKE THANK. THE AGENDA OUTLINES THAT PHASED APPROACH TO IMPLEMENTING THE RATE MODELS PROPOSED IN A RATE STUDY IN THE FIRST. IS RATE ADJUSTMENTS THAT ARE WILL BE EFFECTIVE APRIL FIRST AT. WE DISCUSSED BEFORE THEIR SIGNIFICAN VARIATION IN THE WAY THAT RATES ARE ESTABLISHED TODAY AND ALSO IN HEALTH SERVICES ARE PROVIDED AND SO WE- GET TO DO THIS FIRST THAT. WE REALLY NEED TO OBTAIN A LOT OF INFORMATION FROM ONLY REGIONAL ARTS BUT ALSO SERVICE PROVIDERS. SO WE CAN DO THAT THE DOES THE JUDGMENT FOR APRIL FIRST. THE TO HELP FOR THIS PROCESS AND CAN MAKE FOLKS AWARE- BERMAN AND SUMMIT THEORIES OF PUBLIC MEETINGS WE STARTED THOSE BACK IN NOVEMBER. INDOS MEANS RECORDED BACKGROUND ON THE RATE STUDY ALTHOUGH THE CURRENT RATE REFORM EFFORTS AND THE PROCESS OF WORKING USED TO MAKE THOSE RATE CHANGES. NOW. THERE IS A HUGE UNDERTAKING GATHERING THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION LIKE I SAID IT'S ABOUT- INDIVIDUAL PROVIDING SERVICES WHERE THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED IN SOME CASES THE PACKING SERVICE AND WE'RE DOING THIS IN MAKING HIS REQUEST- WELL YOU KNOW DURING THE LATEST SURGING INCUMBENT NINETEEN G. SO WE WANT TO REALLY EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION FOR ALL THE HARD WORK THAT'S GONE ON AND INSPIRED OF THE CHALLENGES. WE'VE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS EVEN IN SPITE OF THE CHALLENGES AND TO LATER THIS MONTH WE EXPECT TO BEGIN SENDING- UPDATED PROVIDER RATE CUTS OUT TO A REGIONAL CENTER THE KNOWLEDGE OF PROVIDERS WILL ACT ON A FLOW BASIS AND WE HOPE TO GET THE MAJORITY. COMPLETED BY THE END OF MARCH. SO IT'S LIKE THAT WE WON'T HAVE EVERYTHING TO BY END OF MARCH BUT WILL STILL BE. TO THE NUMBER AND GET UPDATED RATES OUT FOR PROVIDERS. AND EVEN THOUGH IT WILL HAPPEN FOR SAMPLE MARCH THOSE RATES WILL STILL BE A FACTOR- APRIL FIRST. REGARDLESS OF WHEN YOU GET THE INFORMATION NEEDED. COUPLE OTHER THINGS TO KNOW. OUR ARE YOU KNOW IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. THAT WE GET FEDERAL FUNDING FOR THESE RATE CHANGES AND IN OUR APPLICATION FOR THAT. THAT CHANGE WAS SUBMITTED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN DECEMBER AND SO HOPEFULLY WILL RECEIVE INFORMATION ON FINAL APPROVAL. AT SOME POINT NEXT MONTH. AND THEN YOU KNOW THE RATE STUDY AS YOU MENTIONED- WEST WEST PUBLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THERE WAS AN UPDATE IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY. SO PART OF WHAT WE'RE DOING TO IS THAT WE NEED TO UPDATE THE RATES. ARE BASED ON THE BRAKE MODELS THAT WORK PUBLISHED OR UPDATED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY SO UTILIZING MORE CURRENT INFORMATION ON WAGES AND THE OTHER COST COMPONENTS THE MODEL. DOES THOSE RATES WILL BE AVAILABLE SOON AND SO WE'LL USE THOSE UPDATED RATES TO DO A COMPARISON TO THE PROVIDERS CURRENT RATE MAKE DOES THAT THE CALCULATIONS OF THE CHANGES. AND THEN. REGARDING YOUR QUESTION ABOUT IF THERE ARE ANY STATUTORY OR OTHER CHANGES NOW- WE WOULD EXPECT THAT ON THE EXISTING DIRECTIVE AUTHORITY THAT THAT ALREADY THAT IS IN THE STATUTE THAT MIGHT ALONG WITH THE RATE REFORM WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO ADDRESS ANY OPERATIONAL ISSUES THAT WE KNOW NOW- YOU KNOW AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF CHANGES THAT ARE GOING TO NEED TO BE MADE BETTER ENVISIONED BY THE RATE STUDY SO THERE WILL BE A REGULATORY PROCESS THAT- TO FULLY IMPLEMENT- THE RATE STUDY AND TO IMPLEMENT THE STRUCTURE THAT'S A PROPOSED IN THE RATE SETTING. AND LEADS TO. UNIQUE OTHER. ABOUT I DO. ADDRESS ANY REFINED IN RATE SETTING. SO WE'RE WORKING WITH AN INTEL THE NUMBER OF TARGETED MEETINGS WITH GROUPS THAT DIFFERENCE SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE EARLY START TRANSPORTATION SUPPORTED AND INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES AMONGST OTHERS AND THEY'VE EXPRESSED SOME CONCERNS OR HAVE SOME SUGGESTIONS ABOUT SOME OF THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT WERE MADE IN ESTABLISHING THE RATE MODELS. INFO AT WE CONTINUE THIS WORK WE'D EXPECT THERE MAY BE REFINEMENTS THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED TO THE REGULATORY BUDGET PROCESS. IT WITH THAT HISTORIC INVESTMENTS- THAT RATE REFORM BRINGS THE ONGOING COLLABORATIVE ASSESSMENT AND MONITORING. OF THE IMPLEMENTATION IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL. IN I ALSO WANT TO ADDRESS THE SERVICE STAFF RECOMMENDED YET GENDER AND WE HAVE BEEN ON AND WILL PROVIDE AN ESTIMATED COST IN TIME ENOUGH FEDERAL APPROVAL FOR ACCELERATING THE RATE INCREASE. IN AND WE CAN ROVIDE THAT BY MARCH FOURTH THAT SUGGEST. SO WITH THAT I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO MR SERVING GOTTA TALK ABOUT THE INCENTIVES. THANKS JIM. BURST AT THE TRIBECA WITH THE WITH THE DEPARTMENT THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY- I'M HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT- THE SECOND SOME PART OF THIS ITEM. I WHICH IS THE QUALITY INCENTIVE PROGRAMWE WERE ASKED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PLAN FOR THAT PROGRAM IN A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE OF HOW THE PROGRAM. MIGHT WORK WHEN IT'S IMPLEMENTED. I'M THEIR THEIR ARE THE CALL AND CENTER PROGRAMS IS WHY OF THOSE IN. RECENTLY THAT IS ANTI TO MOVE THE- SERVICES SYSTEM OF FURTHER FOCUS ON OUTCOMES. I WOULD THE RANGE. THIS THIS PROGRAM- WILL PROVIDE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO MEET OR EXCEED BENCHMARKS ON QUALITY MEASURES THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED THIS YEAR. AND THAT WE EXPECT WILL EVOLVE IN FUTURE YEARS. THE PROGRAM IS REQUIRED TO BE FULLY IMPLEMENTED IN THE TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX FISCAL YEAR. THE FINAL PERSON. QUALITY OUTCOME MEASURES. AT THE END. LEVEL AS MR MYNACH KNOWLEDGE- THIS IS ANOTHER GROUP THAT HAS BEEN CAN I MEETING- MONTHLY SINCE NOVEMBER THAT TO DEVELOP THE PROGRAM THERE AND IN ADDITION TO THE FORTY ONE MEMBERS OF THE GROUP THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN THOSE MEETINGS AS WELL. WELL LIKE MANY OF THE MEETINGS ON THE SUBJECT ARE THEY ARE RECORDED AND- ALL THE MATERIALS AND RECORDING YOU POSTED ON THE WEBSITE AND INPUT IS AVAILABLE THROUGH A DEDICATED MAILBOX THERE BETWEEN MEETINGS AS WELL SO WE'RE REALLY INTERESTED IN THIS TOPIC. AND APPRECIATE THE ENGAGEMENT AND WE'VE HAD SO FAR. OF FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED. AFTER SOME LEVEL SAID ACROSS DIVERSE MEMBERSHIP OF THE GROUP- WORKER THE QUALITY OUTCOME MEASURES THAT WOULD LIKE TO ACHIEVE IN TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX. ARE YOU CAN THINK OF THIS IS DEFINING WHERE WE WANT TO BE AT THE END OF THE ROAD AND I WILL BE WORKING WITH THAT GROUP ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO DEFINE THAT THE PASTOR CHIEF THOSE THOSE. QUALITY OUTCOME MEASURES. ONE IT IS AN ABSOLUTE RESULT WE EXPECT THAT- IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THOSE OUTCOMES MEASURES ANGLES HERE THIS AN EXAMPLE IN A MOMENT- THERE MAY BE SOME INTERIM MEASURES IN THE YEARS OF THE TWENTY ONE ON OUR WAY TO GET TO THOSE EVENTUAL GOALS. WELL IN TERMS OF PROCESS THE WORKING GROUP'S RECOMMENDATIONS ARE STATURE WERE POORLY REQUIRED. TO BE PROVIDED TO THE DEPARTMENT IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. IN APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUIRED TO POST POTENTIAL MEASURES FOR FURTHER PUBLIC INPUT ARE ON THE INTERNET DEPARTMENT WILL CONTINUE TO OF ALL OF THE- INTERIM AND LONG TERM MEASURES AND THEIR ASSOCIATED BENCHMARKS AND METHODOLOGIES. I SEE HOW THOSE MEASURES ARE CALCULATED BUT ALSO WHERE WE EXPECT PEOPLE TO BE. FOR AN INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM IN FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE ABOUT THE UPCOMING YEAR. ALTHOUGH THE LONG TERM MEASURES ARE UNDER DEVELOPMENT HERE'S A POSSIBLE EXAMPLE OF HOW SPECIFIC MEASURE MIGHT WORK. WORKFORCE CAPACITY AND STABILITY AS WE'VE HEARD ALREADY TODAY ARE LARGE PROBLEMS FACING THE SYSTEM TODAY. BECAUSE HOWEVER THE STATE IS NOT THE DIRECT EMPLOYER OF PEOPLE PROVIDING SERVICES THE STATE DOES NOT HAVE INSIGHT INTO THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY PROVIDING SERVICES FOR THEIR COMPENSATION TRAINING AND TURN OF THE- IF WE PRESUME FOR A MOMENT THE QUALITY OUTCOMES FOR INDIVIDUALS. CAN BE SUPPORTED BY A QUALITY WORKFORCE THAT IS PROVIDING SERVICES TO THEM. THEN PERHAPS HAVING A QUALITY WORKFORCE IS A MEASURE THAT SUPPORTS QUALITY OUTCOMES. WE COULD NOT FIND A QUALITY WORKFORCE AS AN ADEQUATE AND STABLE SUPPLY OF PEOPLE APPROPRIATELY TRAINED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. YOU'RE NOT ALONE KRISPYKREME CULTURALLY COMPETENT MANNER THAT RESPECTS INDIVIDUAL CHOICES AND IS GEARED TO ACHIEVE. OUR DESIRED PERSON CENTERED OUTCOMES SO THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A MOUTHFUL BUT IT'S A TASTE OF HOW COMPLEX THE DEFINITION MIGHT BE NONE COULD AN EXAM OF A LONG TERM QUALITY OUTCOME MEASURE. TO KNOW WHETHER WE'RE SUSTAINING A QUALITY WORKFORCE REQUIRES MUCH MORE INFORMATION THAN WE HAVE TODAY AND THEN TRACKING THAT INFORMATION OVER. FOR EXAMPLE IN YEAR ONE WE MIGHT SURVEYS SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR THE FIRST TIME TO COLLECT SOME BASELINE INFORMATION ABOUT THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES THAT THEY HAVE PROVIDING SERVICES. THEIR COMPENSATION BILL LANGUAGE COMPETENCIES AND OUR AVERAGE TENURE OR TURNOVER RATES. NEAR TO DO WE MIGHT BUILD ON NOT BY COLLECTING THE SAME INFORMATION AND THEN ANALYZING WHETHER INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE MAKING AND WORKFORCE TRAINING AND RATE ADJUSTMENTS ARE HAVING THEIR INTENDED IN. WE MIGHT ALSO BEGIN TO COLLECT THIRD PARTY INFORMATION SUCH AS SURVEYS OF INDIVIDUALS. ABOUT THEIR SERVICE PROVIDER EXPERIENCE IN TERMS OF THE TRAINING AND CULTURAL COMPETENCY THAT THEY'RE EXPERIENCING. IN YEAR THREE WE MIGHT CONTINUE THOSE SURVEYS AND ALSO BEGIN TO INCREASE THE WEIGHT GIVEN TO THE THIRD PARTY INFORMATION- FROM THE INDIVIDUALS BEING SERVED AS- THE GOAL ULTIMATELY IS INDIVIDUAL PERSON CENTRED QUALITY OUTCOME MEASURES. THE PROGRAM ALONG THE WAY WOULD PROVIDE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES WELL PERHAPS SIMPLY INITIALLY JUST FOR PROVIDING THAT DATA THAT FOUNDATIONAL DATA WE WOULD NEED TO BE CONSTRUCTED MEASURE AND KNOW WHERE WE ARE. AND THEN INCREASINGLY FOR PERFORMING AT OR ABOVE BENCHMARK LEVELS ON THE MEASURE FOR MAKING MEANINGFUL PROGRESS TOWARD THE BENCHMARK. WHICH COULD BE FOR EXAMPLE AND IN THIS CASE REDUCE TURNOVER CERTAIN LEVELS OF TRAINING AND CERTAIN TOPICS THAT ARE VALIDATED AS PRACTICED. AND OUR WORKFORCE COMPOSITION DEMOGRAPHICS THAT ARE MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH THE COMMUNITY BEING SERVED. SO I'M GONNA WORK KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE THESE MEASURES ARE STILL BEING DEVELOPED EVEN THIS EXAMPLES AND IN PERFECT AND HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE BUT STILL LACKS SOME DETAILS- WE'RE REALLY APPRECIATIVE OF THE ENGAGEMENT THAT TIME AND THE EXPERTISE OF OUR SYSTEMS INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES AND- STICK TO STAKEHOLDERS AND REGIONAL CENTERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS. AND WE EXPECT THAT IN GAUGE MEANT TO CONTINUE WELL INTO THE FUTURE AS THIS PROGRAM CONTINUES TO BE- INTO TO INVOLVE MEASURES THAT WE ULTIMATELY DECIDE UPON THAT THEIR MEANINGFUL BUT THERE ARE VALID AND RELIABLE. THAT THERE FEASIBLE TO COLLECT. ON THE DAY WE'RE NOT CREATING PERVERSE ARE CONTRADICTORY IMPACTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. YOU HEARD IN THIS EXAMPLE THERE MAY BE AREAS OF WHICH TODAY WE LACK THE DATA OR PROCESS INFRASTRUCTURE TO CALCULATE A MEASURE ON DAY ONE AND THAT'S REALLY WHERE THE SYNERGIES WITH OTHER INITIATIVES FROM REGIONAL CENTER PERFORMANCE MEASURES TO THE NEW CASE MANAGEMENT OR OR THE NEW HAND OR THE NEW FISCAL SYSTEM. OR THE WORKFORCE INVESTMENTS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ALL COME TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE AND THAT MEASURE QUALITY PERSON CENTRED OUTCOMES AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL AT THE ULTIMATE ON. I'M STILL A LITTLE OF A MOUTHFUL BUT HOPEFULLY FOR EXAMPLE. THANK YOU FOR MUCH WE WILL NEXT HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- CHRISTOPHER O'NEILL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD TO THE PRESENTATION. NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM SONYA PADDOCK WITH THE L. L. THANK YOU DOCTOR AND IT WAS WHEN YOU PICK WITH THE L. A. O. AND- SO THE FIRST THING WE WOULD SAY IS- THE RATE. RATE STEADY IMPROVEMENT TO THE RATE REFORM QUALITY INCENTIVE PROGRAM REPRESENTS SUCH A HUGE CHANGE IN THE SYSTEM IT'S A- POSITIVE STEP TOWARD A MORE RATIONAL AND TRANSPARENT SYSTEM FOR PAYING. THE MANY PROVIDERS SERVING INDIVIDUALS IN THE SYSTEM AND WE REALLY HAD TO BIG- QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS PROCESS- GOING GOING INTO THIS- BUDGET CYCLE. SO THE FIRST WAS HELL WILL BE HAS MAKE IT HEARD OF IMPROVEMENTS TO THE SYSTEM. AND OUR OUR REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE DEPARTMENT- REALLY STARTED TO ADDRESS THIS TODAY WHICH WAS WAS GREAT TO HEAR- AND I WOULD JUST UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING A TRANSPARENT SORT OF CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT PROCESS I MEAN IT'S BETTER TO SORT OF. IF THERE'S ISSUES THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY NOW THAT NEED TO BE FIXED IT'S BETTER TO FIX THEM NOW AND THEN TO YOU KNOW IMPLEMENTED- A RATE SETTING PROCESS THAT- MAY BE WITH US FOR SOME TIME- SO JUST TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE- THE AGREEMENT THAT WAS REACHED LAST YEAR INCLUDED THE- THE PLAN TO PHASE IN RATE INCREASES OVER FIVE YEARS. AND THESE RATE INCREASES ARE BASED ON WHAT THE RATE MODEL SAY RATES SHOULD BE AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO MISTER NIGHT- INDICATED THAT THOSE THE ACTUAL. AMOUNTS WILL BE AVAILABLE SOON. SO THIS THAT IN FIVE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX- THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO LEVEL RATES WILL BE FULLY PHASED IN- MEANING THEY'RE SORT OF. RT DATE- SO ONE BENEFIT OF THE RATE MODELS IS THAT THEY CAN BE UPDATED WITH- REGULARITY AND WITH SOME AMOUNT AND HE'S BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT THE INPUTS ARE INTO THOSE THREE MODELS. SO YOU KNOW QUESTION IN OUR OF MY INTO THEN IS HOW DOES THE DEPARTMENT INTENDS TO APPROACH UPDATING RATES AFTER TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX- ANOTHER. WHICH MISTER KNIGHT ALSO ALLUDED TO IT'S JUST THAT RATE MODELS WERE DEVELOPED PRIOR TO THE COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND THERE MAY BE SOME LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE PANDEMIC EXPERIENCE THAT SHOULD BE INCORPORATED. INTO THE RATE SETTING PROCESS SO AGAIN WE JUST UNDERSCORE THAT IT WOULD BE SORT OF BETTER TO YOU- FREE VISIT YOU KNOW IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT GO INTO THE RATE MODELS OR ABOUT SERVICE DESIGN ANSWERED. BETTER TO ADDRESS THOSE NOW- YOU KNOW BEFORE BEFORE THE REMOTE OR SOMETHING. IN PLACE AND OFTEN READING. I'M BILL THE OTHER MAIN QUESTION THAT WE HAD AND MISTER TO BANK TRINCA- ALLUDED TO THIS A MOMENT AGO CONCERNS- DDS IS BIG I. T. SYSTEMS AND- BUSINESS SORT OF THE PERENNIAL COMMENT THAT THE L. A- MAKES IT BUDGET HEARINGS ABOUT DDS IS I. T. SYSTEMS- BUT WE WOULD SAY AT. THIS YEAR THAT DDS IS RECEIVING PLANNING DOLLARS FROM THE FEDERAL EACH CBS FUNDS TO OVERHAUL TWO OF IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT DATA SYSTEMS THE CONSUMER RECORDS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. AS WELL AS THE UNIFORM FISCAL SYSTEM WHICH SUPPORTS- THE INVOICING AND PAYMENT OF SERVICE PROVIDERS- I KNOW THIS ISSUE- I THINK IT'S GOING TO COME UP LATER IN THE HEARING IN ON ISSUE NINE BUT THE REASON I WANTED TO BRING. IT UP HERE IS THAT- J. TO POINT OUT HOW BY THESE. SYSTEMS WILL BE TO. PERFORM BASED PROGRAMS THE QUALITY INCENTIVE PROGRAM AS WELL AS THE REGIONAL CENTER PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE. PROGRAM THEY'RE ALSO JUST VITAL TO UNDERSTANDING SYSTEM TRENDS BE IT CONSUMER OUTCOMES CONSUMER CONSUMER SERVICE NEEDS. SERVICE GAPS GAPS IN SERVICE PROVIDER AVAILABILITY- PERFORMANCE OF REGIONAL CENTERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS EQUITY IN THE PURCHASE OF SERVICE AND- OTHER SPENDING TRENDS. SO- ONE OF OUR CONCERNS IS THAT THERE WERE NO DETAILS ABOUT THE PLANNING THE I. T. PLANNING PROCESS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SO WE HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT- HOW DDS IS GOING TO APPROACH THIS PROCESS. AND HOW DDS WILL IMPLEMENT THESE PERFORMANCE SPACE PROGRAMS IN THE ABSENCE OF- BEFORE THESE SYSTEMS REALLY ARE IN PLACE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM JORDAN LINDSAY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ARC IN UCPE CALIFORNIA COLLABORATION ALL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M SHORTLANDS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF YOUR CAN YOU SEE CALIFORNIA COLLABORATION SPEAKING ON BEHALFOF R. TWENTY TO R. CHAPTERS ACROSS THE STATE TEN. OF THE IT'S ON OUR THIRTY SEVEN BOARD MEMBERS WHO ARE ALL PARENTS AND FAMILY MEMBERS INDIVIDUALS WITH IDEAS WELL AS INDIVIDUALS AB DE UM I ALSO SPEAK TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE LAND IN QUESTION. ALSO BEGIN TO ANSWER THE QUESTION ON THE AGENDA I WANT TO GIVE BRIEF. CONTEXT FOR HOW WE GOT HERE. APOLOGY IF YOU CAN HEAR SIRENS IN THE BACK. FIFTY YEARS AGO CALIFORNIA PASOLINI'S ACT AND THE ACT WAS UPHELD AND STRENGTH IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE COURT CASE THE ARK VERSE DDS WHEN THE COURT RULED THAT. THE ACT DEFINES A BASIC RIGHTS IN THE CORRESPONDING BASIC OBLIGATION THE RIGHTS WHICH GRANTS TO THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED PERSONS TO BE PROVIDED WITH SERVICES THAT ENABLE HIM TO LIVE A MORE INDEPENDENT AND PRODUCTIVE LIVES IN THE COMMUNITY. THE OBLIGATION WHICH IMPOSES ON THE STATE IS TO PROVIDE SUCH SERVICES. PERSON HAS THE RIGHT TO BE PROVIDED WITH SERVICES IN THE STATE HOUSE OF OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES. THAT'S FORTY TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND FOR MANY YEARS THOSE SERVICES WEREN'T BEING ADEQUATELY PROVIDED IN THE LEGISLATURE. AT THAT TIME REQUIRED TO REPEAT THIS STEP RIGHT STUDY TO BE DONE AND AS WE KNOW IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IT IDENTIFIED THAT SERVICES WERE BEING UNDERFUNDED. BY ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION. LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE LEANED INTO OUR COMMUNITY AND WE'RE SO GRATEFUL AND THREW A ROCK EFFORTS INCLUDING OF COURSE THE EFFORTS OF THIS COMMITTEE. AND PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ADVOCACY COMMUNITY- YOU WERE ABLE TO PASS THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RATE STUDY STARTING WITH 25% THE ST PAUL- IT REALLY WILL CREATE AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED. I'M IN FUTURE ABOUT PERSON CENTERED IN ALKEM BASED SYSTEM. IN THERE IS GREAT HOPE AND OPTIMISM IN THE COMMUNITY FOR THE FUTURE. BUT I DO WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT THE PRESENT. AS IT'S BEEN MENTIONED UNDER THE FUNDING HAS ACTUALLY YET AND ALLOCATED IN THE COMMUNITY. AS UNDERGONE EXTREME STRESS DURING THE PANDEMIC LSO MOST URGENTLY THERE IS AN ACUTE STAFFING SHORTAGE AS IT'S ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED ACROSS THE STATE. WHICH IS CAUSING RATIONING OF SERVICES AND INADEQUATE ACCESS I'VE BEEN ASKED TO TALK ABOUT ON THE IMPACT ON PROVIDERS IN AN INFORMAL SURVEY OF. NINETY COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS WHICH IS COMPLETED LAST WEEK AND OUT OF THE NINETY PROVIDERS THERE WERE 200-060-0404 CURRENT JOB OPENINGS. AND I MEAN IN 19% FEWER EMPLOYEES THAN PREPRINT ADVOCATE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY THAT MEANS ONE OUT OF. EVERY FIVE STAFF IS GONE AND WE CAN'T GET THEM BACK RIGHT NOW. IF YOU EXTRAPOLATE THAT TO CASELOAD AT BEING SERVED ON CURRENT CASELOADS. OR BOARD OR LIKELY WHAT IS HAPPENING THAT WE'RE HEARING. IS THAT PEOPLE ARE BEING SERVED AT A MUCH DIMIISHED SERVICES- BECAUSE WE JUST CANNOT FIND THE BODIES IN THE PEOPLE. TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE STAFFING. IT'S THE SAME THING I'M IMPACTING ALL SECTORS ACROSS THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. EXCEPT THAT WE CAN'T COMPENSATE BY RAISING WAGES WHICH IS WHY WE NEED INCREASED RATES NOW BECAUSE THE MONEY WILL GO STRAIGHT TO WAGES TO THE WORKFORCE. MOST CRITICALLY I WANT TO ALSO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPACT AND THE BURDEN THAT'S BEEN SHOULDERED BY INDIVIDUALS WITH IT AND- HE'S- AS A SNAPSHOT. BOTH ARE CALIFORNIA'S BOARD PRESIDENT IN PAST PRESENT. AND THEIR ADULT CHILDREN MOVING OUT OF INDEPENDENT LIVING AND PACKING WITH THEIR PARENTS. BECAUSE THERE ARE NO STAFF TO SUPPORT THEM. IT TRAGICALLY ALSO LOSING SECTION EIGHT HOUSING UNITS RESULT. OF WE CANNOT WAIT FOR THE WAIT RIGHT STUDY IMPLEMENTATION TO TRICKLE OUT THE NEXT FOUR YEARS THE NEED IS URGENT. WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THIS TREMENDOUS CHALLENGE THIS TREMENDOUSLY CHALLENGING TIME. AT THE SAME TIME THE AVERAGE MINUTES BUDGET SURPLUS. WE BELIEVE THAT BY ACCELERATING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RIGHT STUDY BY ONE YEAR AS A ONE TIME INVESTMENT. AND ALSO ACCELERATING THE QUALITY AND OUTCOMES BASED REQUIREMENTS THAT WE CAN BEGIN TO AGGRESSIVELY COMPETE ONCE AGAIN. FOR WORKERS. AND WE HAVE SOME IT IS. PROPOSAL TO YOUR- WE ALSO DO WANT TO IN UP IN THE SIX. AND SAY SITUATION JUST A FEW YEARS TIME WHICH IS WE ALL SEE THAT. FOR A REGULAR UPDATES OF THE RATE MODELS WE- I MISS PETTICOAT EVERYTHING YEARS. TO UPDATE THE RIGHT MODELS SUBSEQUENTLY THE RATES. FINALLY WE HAVE CHANGED AS A COMMUNITY AS YOU HAVE MENTIONED MISTER CHAIR SINCE THE PANDEMIC BEGAN TWO YEARS AGO. AND THE RATE STUDY ANALYZED A PRE PANDEMIC SYSTEM OF SUPPORTS AND SERVICES WE BELIEVE THERE IS A NEED FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO REQUEST AN ADDENDUM TO THE RIGHT STUDY AND WE THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR FOR JUST DOING CELL AND- WE HOPE THAT IT WILL YOU GIVE US A CHANCE TO EVALUATE NEEDED UPDATES TO MODELS ELIGIBLE SERVICES BILLING METHODS. I'M IN THIS TO WE HAVE SUBMITTED TO THE COMMITTEE FOR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM JUDY MARC PRESIDENT. FOR DISABILITY VOICES UNITED. THANK YOU SO MUCH. MY NAME IS JUDY MARC BOB I AM THE PRESIDENT OF DISABILITY VOICES UNITED AN ORGANIZATION LED AND STAFFED. EXCLUSIVELY BY PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND OTHER DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. I AM ALSO THE PARENT OF A TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD SON WITH AUTISM WHO SERVED BY REGIONAL CENTER. I AM HERE TO PRESENT THE SOUTH AFRICAN FAMILY PERSPECTIVE ON THE SUBJECT. TO BE HONEST MOST PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES LIVE DAY TO DAY. AND NEVER EVEN HEARD OF THE RATE SETTING. WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT MANY OF US HAVE TO FIGHT TO RECEIVE SERVICES AND GOOD PROVIDERS SO THE IDEA OF RATES IS NOT EVEN ON OUR RADAR. HERE'S WHAT WE DO CARE ACT WE WANT TO HAVE SERVICE PROVIDERS WHO ARE RESPECTFUL RELIABLE AND RESTORES FULL IN HELPING US MEET OUR PERSONAL GOALS. THERE ARE MANY AMAZING PROVIDERS OUT THERE WHO HAVE THOSE QUALITIES. WHEN I SPEAK TO OUR COMMUNITY ABOUT THIS ISSUE THEY ARE OFTEN SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT RATES ARE NOT TIED TO OUTCOMES. DOESN'T IT JUST MAKES SENSE TO PAY HIGHER RATES TO THE PROVIDERS TO DO BETTER FOR THEIR CLIENTS. THE REGIONAL CENTER THE SAME RETOOL PROVIDER THAT TREAT US WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT AS THE YEAR TO A PROVIDER THAT ABUSE. WHY IS THE RATE THE SAME FOR PROVIDER THAT HELPS US ACHIEVE OUR PERSON CENTRED INCLUSIVE OUTCOMES. AS IT IS FOR ONE THAT KEEPS A SEGREGATED AREN'T SITTING IN A MEANINGFUL OUTCOMES THAT MATTER TO PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES THIS IS WHERE THE CONVERSATION NEEDS TO BE TODAY. WE DEEPLY APPRECIATE THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO CHOOSE TO WORK WITH US AND OUR FAMILY MEMBERS. BUT WE ARE NOT A REGIONAL CENTER OR PROVIDER CENTERED SYSTEM WE ARE A PERSON CENTRED SYSTEM AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE ISSUE WITH THIS LANDS YOU MIGHT COME AWAY WITH A VERY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE. LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ESTABLISHED A MULTI YEAR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TWENTY NINETEEN RIGHT STUDY FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE APPROACH AND SCHEDULE. THAT TIES THE PHASE IN OF RATE INCREASES TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A QUALITY INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO IMPROVE CONSUMER OUTCOMES SERVICE PROVIDER PERFORMANCE AND QUALITY OF SERVICE. WE HAVE HEARD REQUESTED A TO ACCELERATE THE SCHEDULE THIS ACCELERATION SHOULD ONLY BE CONSIDERED IF WE ALSO SPEED UP THE QUALITY INSPECTOR PROGRAM. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE FOLLOWING MEASURES COULD LEAD TO QUALITY SERVICES AND IMPROVED OUTCOMES FIRST RATE INCREASES SHOULD BE DIRECTLY LINKED TO AN INCREASE IN THE WAGES OF DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS OUR DS PEAS. SINCE THE GOAL MANY TODAY'S TO STABILIZE THE DSP WORKFORCE BANKING WAGES THAT CAN ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED RESPONSIBLE STAFF WHY DON'T WE NOT REQUIRING THAT THE READING CRISPY USED TO RAISE WAGES FOR DSPS. SECOND CONGREGATE SERVICE PROVIDER SHOULD HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE MEANINGFUL EFFORTS TOWARD COMPLIANCE WITH THE H. T. V. S. FINAL RULE BEFORE RECEIVING RATE INCREASES. WE ARE ONE SHORT YEAR AWAY FROM LOSING FEDERAL FUNDING FOR LACK OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE H. TVS ROLE. YET MANY OF OUR CONGREGATE SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE NOWHERE CLOSE TO BE THEIR SERVICES TOWARDS COMPLIANCE. THE READING CREASES OFFERED OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT INCENTIVE TO PUSH THOSE CONGREGATE PROVIDERS TOWARD DEVELOPING FEDERALLY REQUIRED INTEGRATED SETTINGS AND PERSON CENTERED SERVICE. THIRD QUALITY PERFORMANCE MEASURES BEING DEVELOPED BY DDS SHOULD FOCUS ON THE PERSON CENTERED OUTCOMES OF PEOPLE WITH IDG I'M NOT A SERVICE PROVIDER COMPLIANCE. FOR EXAMPLE A QUALITY PERFORMANCE MEASURE COULD BE THE PERSON FEEL THEY HAVE CONTROL OVER THEIR DAY TO DAY LIFE. AN INTERIM ASSESSMENT TO WORK TOWARD THAT MEASURE COULD BE STAFF HAVE BEEN TRAINED IN PERSON CENTERED THINKING. BUT THE QUALITY OUTCOME WE ARE ULTIMATELY SEEKING TO ACHIEVE IS ABOUT THE PERSON NOT THE PROVIDER DV YOU ALONG WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS WILL BE PRESENTING TO DDS IN THE LEGISLATURE MORE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE COMING WEEKS FOR CALLING FOR QUALITY PERFORMANCE MEASURES BASED ON INDIVIDUALIZED OUTCOMES. FINALLY THE MODERNIZATION OF OUR OUTDATED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM MUST BE PRIORITIZED IN ORDER TO TRACK OUTCOMES AND TIED UP TO PROVIDER RATE. ALL OF THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW COMES IS PURELY ACADEMIC BECAUSE- INCREDIBLY OBSOLETE I. T. SYSTEM CAN'T POSSIBLY TRACK THE- WE ARE SPENDING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS INCREASING PROVIDER RATES WITHOUT HAVING ANY IDEA HOW TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE INVESTMENT WAS WORTH IT. WE CALL THE LEGISLATURE TO PUT ASIDE MONIES NOW FOR THIS TRANSFORMATIONAL SYSTEMS OVERHAUL THAT INCLUDES AN OUTWARD FACING COMPONENT THAT ALLOWS REGIONAL CENTER CLIENTS TO ACCESS THE RECORDS VERIFYING PROVIDER INVOICES AND REPORTS AND PROVIDE REAL TIME FEEDBACK ABOUT THEIR SERVICE. THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM BABY ON HAN WHO IS THE SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH THE- INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES PRACTICE GROUP DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT TODAY MY NAME IS THAT THE AND CURRENT I AM WITH THIS ABILITY RIGHT CALIFORNIA WHICH IS THE STATE'S PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY AGENCY. THERE'S NO QUESTION WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FURIOUS WORK. PROVIDE OVER THE LAST YEAR I'M SORRY RIGHT CAL EVERYDAY PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING FROM SOMEONE WHO NEEDS TWENTY FOUR SEVEN CARE THAT CAN'T FIND ENOUGH. MEETING HELD AT HOME ALONE FOR HOURS AT A TIME FROM A MARKET OUT OF THE HIGH DESERT YOU CAN'T FIND ANYONE IN HER AREA YOU CAN SUPPORT HER CHILD IN THE LANGUAGE THEY SPEAK. STORIES LIKE THESE OUT EVERY DAY AND MAKE IT CLEAR WE HAVE TO ACT URGENTLY TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN MORE DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS. QUALITY JOBS AND QUALITY SERVICES ARE IN EXTRA COMPLETELY. WHAT IS OUR COMPETITIVE WAGES AND THOSE WHO EXCEL TO BE VALUED AND PAID ACCORDINGLY. FOR THAT TO HAPPEN WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO FIND WHAT QUALITY SUPPORT LOOKS LIKE IN THE LIFE OF A PERSON WITH IT. YOU STRONGLY THAT IF WE WANT TO ACCELERATE THE TIME FRAME FOR BREAKING. ACT RATE BY HALF TO BE TIED TO A FEW CRITICAL. FIRST LET'S MAKE SURE THOSE INCREASES DOWN TO WHERE THEY NEED. TO RAISE OUR WAGES FOR FRONTLINE STAFF. LET'S ALSO ACCELERATOR TIME FRAME FOR IDENTIFYING WHAT QUALITY OUTCOMES RIGHT AND FOR FIGURING OUT HOW PROVIDERS CAN GET HOLD MORE FOR THOSE THAT COME. IF THE RATE INCREASES MOVE UP A YEAR THE SCHEDULE FOR HAVING QUALITY INCENTIVES AND INDIVIDUAL LEVEL OUTCOME MEASURES SHOULD MOVE UP A YEAR IN. ANOTHER THE TWENTY NINETEEN RICK STUDY THAT HELLO THIS WAS BASED ON. AS WE'VE JUST BEEN DISCUSSING THERE IS A LOT THAT IT DOESN'T TRACK. TWENTY NINETEEN WAS BEFORE CODED BEFORE EIGHT PROGRAMS ARE DISTRESSED AND REMOTE SERVICES BEGIN PAYING BEFORE SOCIAL RECREATION CAMPING SERVICES PROFESSOR ACTED BEFORE WE NEED A MINIMUM WAGE SETTING WOULD BE. OUT WE ALL MESSED TWENTY NINETEEN BUT IF WE HAVE LIVE IN THIS. RATE STEADY HOW TO BE DRY HERE TO. BUT A BREAK THAT TO REFLECT OF THE- CHANGES THAT SEEN. INTO IN THE LAST FEW YEARS IMPORTANT EIGHT WE CAN ALL. RIGHT STUDY WAS BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT PROVIDERS CONTINUE TO BE CALLED ON TO BE RESTORED. FOR BOB CHANGING OUT TO. WHEN THE RATE INCREASE ARE DONE WE NEED AND BRAKES AND ONE THAT'S REAL AND THEN PARADIGM WE MOVING TOWARD A ONE FINDER TO PEYTON JUST FOR THE RIGHT NOW BUT CERTAIN THEY PROVIDE BUT ALSO THE QUALITY AND THE COMPLEXITY OF THE WORK THAT THEY DO. IN THAT SENSE. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY. WHAT IT LOOK LIKE WHEN WE START PAYING PROVIDERS BRIDGE COMES MOST IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. I DON'T HAVE CHOICE AND CONTROL OVER THEIR LIVES. FOR THEM TO BE PART OF COMMUNITIES RECORD CONDUCTED READING A LONG FOR THEM TO HAVE A WAYS TO CONTRIBUTE TO BE LAWFULLY EMPLOYED. FOR MAKING SURE THE MOST HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED PEOPLE OF COLOR AND PEOPLE OF THE MOST INTENSE TO SUPPORT ME. EQUAL ACCESS FOR ALL OF THESE THINGS. CHANGING WHAT WOULD PAY PROVIDERS FOR HAS SO MUCH POWER AND POTENTIAL TO DRIVE REAL CHANGE TO SHIP THE PRACTICES NORMS AND EXPECTATIONS. JUST LEAVE MANDATES TOP DOWN DIRECTIVES ALLOWED FROM START FOR THE KINDS OF OUTCOMES WANT TO SEE. IT'S ONE OF WOULD BE EASIER FOR PROVIDERS TO PRIORITIZE THOSE OUTCOMES THAT'S WHEN WE'LL HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THIS HAPPENED AND THAT IS WHEN WE'LL FINALLY START BEING. QUALITY OUTCOMES HAPPENING MORE AND MORE IN THE LIVES OF PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME FALL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WILL HURT HERE FROM MARK MELANSON EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY LIVING NETWORK.

QUALITY OUTCOME BASED SYSTEM FOR PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES CCL AND NUMBER THREE HUNDRED PAGES OF RESEARCH THAT SUPPORTS THE WORK THAT WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSING ON TO DEVELOP THIS PROJECT OVER THE LAST THREE TO FIVE YEARS. THE NATIONAL QUALITY FORUM IN CUBA HAS INDICATED INTEREST AND INTENT TO TRACK SUPPORT AND POTENTIALLY WORK ALONGSIDE CCL AND ON THE EVALUATION PROJECT. AND U. S. AS INDICATED POSSIBLE NATIONAL. IMPACTS ABOUT WORK IT'S PRESENTED TO THEM. WE WERE SO EXCITED TO SEE A ONE ONE FIVE BY THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE THAT SPECIFICALLY NAMES YOU SEE ALLEN AS THE CONTRACTOR THAT WILL NOW ALLOW US TO BEGIN WORK AHEAD OF US. CCOO AND IT'S LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING COLLABORATIVELY BUT SELF ADVOCATES INDIVIDUALS RECEIVING SERVICES AND THEIR FAMILIES. DDS REGIONAL CENTERS STAKEHOLDER WORKGROUPS AND PROVIDERS TO ENSURE AN INTEGRATED AND SEAMLESS APPROACH SIXTY ARLINGTON IN DBS CAN NOW ENGAGE OUR TEAMS OF SELF ADVOCATES LEADING INNOVATORS.

NATIONAL ACT RECOGNIZE IN GLOW BIGGEST OUT BASED MEASUREMENTS FOR IDPS QUALITY INDICATORS MEATPACKER. IT OCCURS IN THE VERY POINT OF INTERACTION BETWEEN A DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONAL WHEN THE PERSON RECEIVING A SERVICE THAT'S WITH THE JOURNEY OF PERSONS OR QUALITY MEASURABLE OUTCOMES BEGINS. DSP TRAINING IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT SUCCESS OF A PROJECT ONE OPTIMIZER WORK WE ENCOURAGE LEGISLATURE NTDS TO ALLOCATE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE TRAINING DSP WORK FORCIBLE PROVIDERS WHO PERSON CENTRED ACTIVE SUPPORTS. EVERY MOMENT AS POTENTIAL. WE WILL JUST TO STRUGGLE TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUAL WITH TEACH WHICH THEIR CHIU MY LIFE AND- OUTCOMES WITHOUT RECOGNIZING THE CHRONIC NEGLECT OF THE WORKERS. AND TAKING IMMEDIATE STEPS TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN A WELL TRAINED AND ADEQUATELY COMPENSATED WORKFORCE. DSPS HAVE BEEN SO CRITICAL IN KEEPING PEOPLE HEALTHY SAFE AND IT HAS BEEN.

NIGHTS HELLO ACCOUNTABILITY- OUR CURRENT WORK FORCE TO. DEPENDS ON IT WE ALSO MUST NOT END IN THE WORK TOWARDS GREAT MODEL MUST FIXED. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH GDS ON THE RATE STUDY IMPLEMENTATION IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROJECT AS WELL AS THE INITIATIVES THAT WERE IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET BILINGUAL EIGHT DSP TRAINING AND CAREER PATHS AND THE DEFINITION. THESE WILL ALL BE CRITICAL STEPS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO BOLSTER THE WORKFORCE. THE CEILING IS GRATEFUL WE LOOK FORWARD TO OUR CONTINUED COLLABORATION WITH CBS AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY OUR COMMUNITY- COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND COMMITTEE STAFF. WITH HIM FOR C. C. ONTAP PATCH THAT TESTIMONY ON TODAY'S PANEL OF THE CAPITA ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. BUT STE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM MARK CLOUSE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF. THE SAN DIEGO REGIONAL CENTER. THANK YOU CHAIR A COMMITTEE MEMBERS I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT. SOME INFORMATION THIS AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS MARK CLASS I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE SAN DIEGO REGIONAL CENTER. SENATOR REGIONAL CENTER SUPPORTS AND SERVES OVER THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS. LIVING IN SAN DIEGO AND IMPERIAL COUNTY X. THE QUESTIONS THAT THAT WERE. THAT I WAS ASKED TO ADDRESS OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES AND WORK FORCE IN PURCHASE OF SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS SERVE OUR FIRE REGIONAL CENTER. THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE IS A LACK OF A WORKFORCE THAT THAT IS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE FACING. OUR VENDORS ARE PROVIDERS ARE FACING STAFFING SHORTAGES AT THIS CRITICAL LEVEL ARE LIMITING INDIVIDUALS ABILITY. TO ACCESS MUCH NEEDED SUPPORTS AND SERVICES. AN EARLIER TEST AMERICA A COUPLE OF THE PANELISTS MENTIONED- THAT THIS WAS CAUSING SOME DISRUPTION IN SERVICES OR OR AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES I WOULD RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE. IN MANY CASES THERE ARE NOT DISRUPTIONS THERE ARE NO SERVICES BEING PROVIDED BE OPTIONS FOR FAMILIES DUE TO PROVIDERS NOT HAVING ADEQUATE STAFF. RESULTS IN NO SERVICES BEING PROVIDED. YOU DON'T HAVE EMPLOYEES YOU CAN'T PROVIDE SERVICES YOU CAN'T PURCHASE SERVICES. IT TOO MANY YEARS A LOT OF THE DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS HAVE BEEN ROCKED RELEGATED TO MINIMUM WAGE EARNERS. ONLY SEEING INCREASES WHEN THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE AND PERCHED ATOP THE ADOPTION OF THE WAKE MODELS WILL GO A LONG WAY. IN MAKING. UP HOW DOES THE REEF MODEL IMPLEMENTATION FIT AND WHAT. CAN YOU RESPOND TO THE NEEDS. EXPLORING THE RIGHT MODEL IMPLEMENTATION BY A YEAR AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM MOST PANELISTS IS WRONG THE ONLY OPTION AT THIS TIME THAT I SEE FROM FROM A STAFFING PERSPECTIVE THE PRICES IN OUR SYSTEM. AND WE REALLY WANT TO HAVE CHOICE IN PERSON CENTERED SERVICES WE NEED TO INVEST IN THE WORK FORCE. A REVIEW OR FIX AND NOT. EARLY START RATES IOS RATE SAYS THIS MISTER MELANSON MENTIONED. AND OTHERS- NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED QUICKLY. IF WE'RE TRULY GOING TO MAKE AN IMPACT. IN FRONT LOADER RESOURCES. WE REALLY NEED TO START WITH PROBABLY EARLY START SERVICE THIS HAS TO BE A PRIORITY ON THE TO DO LIST. WITHOUT THIS INVESTMENT THE ACCELERATION OF THE GREAT MODEL IMPLEMENTATION. MY FEAR IS THAT PEOPLE'S DREAMS PEOPLE'S HOPES THEIR BALLS AND CHOICES WILL NOT HAPPEN. CHANGING THE RATE MODELS IS CRITICAL AS I SAY WE NEED TO DOUBLE UP OUR EFFORTS AND MOVE BACK THAT REPORT. IN TERMS OF QUALITY AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES. THE WORK FINALLY BEING DONE BY DDS QUALITY INCENTIVES WORKGROUP. THANKS MISTER SURVISCOR AND OTHERS THERE ARE OVER FORTY. MEMBERS THE FIRST MEMBERS ON THAT COMMITTEE- MR SAREK ASSEMBLY MET WE MET ONCE A MONTH WE ACTUALLY HAVE FIVE MEETINGS AT FOUR MONTHS WE'VE DOUBLED UP ON JANUARY THIRD WE SPENT A FULL DAY TOGETHER- HAVING THESE DIFFICULT DISCUSSIONS- WE NEED TO REALIZE THAT THERE ARE REALLY NO EASY FIX. MOST OUTCOMES- THIS PATRICK MENTIONED DATA- THAT THAT WAS NOT EASILY AVAILABLE I'D SAY IN MANY CASES IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT JUST USED TO IT IT'S NOT EASILY AVAILABLE JUST NOT. YEAH IN GETTING TO. DATA COLLECTION. LOOKING AT BASED LIGHTING DATA IS REALLY ESSENTIAL OF REMEMBER TRULY DEFINE WHAT QUALITY LOOKS LIKE. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE PARTNERSHIP- WHAT THE PROVIDER COMMUNITY WHAT FAMILIES WERE ADVOCATES WITH EDS THE DEFINING WHAT OUR SERVICES LOOK LIKE IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE SB ON. BEHALF OF THE ANSWERED QUESTIONS THAT THE WE WILL BEGIN WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER RUBIO. YES THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION ON THE RITZ- THE INFORMATION I'M SORRY THE IMPLEMENTATION BUT- WHAT IS THE AMOUNT IT WOULD TAKE TO ACCELERATE THESE- THESE RATES- THE- THAT'S ONE OF THE QUESTIONS. YES HI JIM KNIGHT WITH THE DEPARTMENT DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES THAT MAY INDICATE ENHANCE ITS REQUESTED IN THE AGENDA WILL BE PROVIDING THAT INFORMATION BY MARCH FOURTH THE ESTIMATE NOT ONLY ACOSTA- TIME FOR FEDERAL APPROVAL AS WELL. DO YOU HAVE ANY BALLPARK IDEA. I KNOW I'LL WAIT FOR THE MARCH FOURTH BUT DO YOU HAVE ANY BALLPARK I'M SURE YOU'VE BEEN DOING SOME WORK ALREADY. I DON'T HAVE THAT RIGHT NOW. BUT WE WILL CERTAINLY PROVIDED BY MARCH FOURTH AT THE LATEST. ASSEMBLY WOMAN IF IT'S POSSIBLE I CAN POSSIBLY PROVIDE A BALLPARK- I THINK IT WAS A PART OF THE MUCH MORE DESCRIPTIVE IN MUCH MORE DETAIL- FOR JUST A ONE YEAR- ACCELERATION PROJECT JULY TWENTY. TWENTY THREE TO JULY TWENTY TWENTY TWO WE ESTIMATE THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS AT ONE TIME INVESTMENT. THANK YOU. I WILL BRING AMOUNT TO THE CHAIR AND- BEGIN MY QUESTIONS BY UPLIFTING SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT I'VE HEARD TODAY THAT FOR US TO ACHIEVE QUALITY OUTCOMES WE NEED A QUALITY WORKFORCE WHICH REQUIRES US TO HAVE AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY TO MEET THE NEEDS IN A CULTURAL AND LINGUISTICALLY COMPETENT PERSON CENTERED WAY INSIDE LIKE TO DIG IN A LITTLE BIT TO SOME OF THESE OUTCOMES AND THE IT SYSTEMS THAT WILL NEED TO BE DEVELOPED AND- WOOD LOCKED LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON THE QUESTION FROM THE L. A. O. ABOUT THE PROCESS OF ENGAGEMENT ON. THE THIS I. T. SYSTEM AS WELL AS TO HEAR FROM- BOTH SERVING GO AND MARK MELANSON. ABOUT HOW DO WE HOW DO WE- HOW CAN WE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THIS PRIOR TO COLLECTION OF. DATA AND BASED ON DATA AND- START UP OF THIS IT SYSTEM AND START TO HAPPEN THERE. HI THIS IS MARK WILL INSTANTLY CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY LOOKING AT WORK I DON'T WANT TO JUMP IN FRONT OF PEOPLE- YOU KNOW I GO BACK TO THE FIRST STAKEHOLDER MEETING THAT WE HAD WITH TVS ON QUALITY INCENTIVES HANDS ON MARCO ONE OF THE FIRST MEETING SAMMARCO FROM CHS JOINED AND SAID YOU KNOW HOW- ON WE'VE GOT TO START SOMEWHERE. YOU KNOW OUR X. WE EXPECT TO COURSE CORRECT ALONG THE WAY- AS DEVELOPED AS AS OUTCOMES AND MEASURES ARE DEVELOPED- AND I'M I'M NOT GONNA SPEAK TO THE TECHNOLOGY AND DATA SYSTEM THAT'S NOT MY WHEELHOUSE- BUT- WE'VE GOT TO START SOMEWHERE- AND I JUST I'VE HEARD THAT ECHOED- IN THE CAPITAL AS WELL SO THAT THAT WOULD BE MY COMMENTS. TO THAT QUESTION COMMONWEALTH'S IF KEEP WANTS. TO FOLLOW UP. THERE ARE SO YOU KNOW I MEAN FIRST ATTY COMBO. OF IS THAT THE OTHER DAY. THAT I GAVE YOU A SITE THAT THE- WE ACTUALLY HAVE MEASURES LIKE A- TO DEPARTMENT OR- A COUPLE OF STRANGE. HAVING JUST SAID THAT- I THINK. IT'S A FAIRLY LONG- EXPECTATION THAT SOMETHING AROUND WORKFORCE THE PEOPLE ACTUALLY DELIVERING THE SERVICE. WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE QUALITY OF. THAT OUTCOME FOR THE AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL BUT WE'RE ALL SEEKING TO ACHIEVE SO. I THINK SUBJECT MATTER WISE IT'S CERTAINLY GOING TO BE INCLUDED- I THINK YOU WOULD BE HAPPY TO BE HERE PERHAPS THAT. COLLECTION OF DATA ABOUT THE WORK FORCE CAN BE SOMEWHAT SEPARATED FROM THE I. T. SYSTEM. OF THE STATE OR NATIONALLY. OUR THE DEPARTMENT IS- ENGAGED AT MOMENT WITH- VARIETY OF. COLLECTING INPUT REGARD A S. OF STOPS THE BILL- WERE. THE OPERA. THAT EXISTS TO USE- THE NATIONAL CORE INDICATORS YOUR MODEL FOR THIS PURPOSE- IT'S- THAT MATCH CORN WE ARGUES FOR THEIR SURVEYS IN CALIFORNIA SERVING INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES ARE DARK GUARDIANS- AND ADULTS. AND THEY HAVE A MODEL AVAILABLE THAT'S USED BY MANY OTHER STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY- TO LOOK AT STAFF STABILITY SO THIS IS KIND OF WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT RIGHT TURN OVER RATES COMPENSATION LEVELS. ON THE BACK BENEFIT AMOUNTS AVERAGE TENURE OF THOSE KINDS OF THINGS- SO WE ARE HOPEFUL AND EXPECTING TO BE ABLE TO LAUNCH THAT IN THE SPRING THIS YEAR- THE NATIONAL SURVEY CLOSURE DATE IS AT THE END OF JUNE- I'M SO WE WOULD BE WE WOULD BE COLLECTING NOT NOT NOT THROUGH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I G. SYSTEM AND PROJECT BUT RATHER THROUGH THE NATIONAL SURVEYING- INSTRUMENT- THAT WAY THAT'S A SURVEY THIS COMPLETED BY. ARE THE SERVICE PROVIDERS AND VENDORS- THAT- EMPLOYEE DIRECT SERVICE PROFESSIONALS SO IT'S ALSO ONLY A SLICE OF THE WORK FORCE BUT THE VERY IMPORTANT SLICE THAT DIRECTLY- ENGAGES WITH CONSUMERS- AND SO WE ARE NOT BE THE FIRST TIME THAT CALIFORNIA WOULD DO THAT SURVEY- IT'S- AT LEAST CURRENTLY ENVISIONED AS A VOLUNTARY SURVEY- AND- AS SUCH YOU KNOW WE REALLY WANT FOLKS TO. HELP US SEE THE VALUE. IN IN PROVIDING THIS INFORMATION- YOU KNOWAND ASSURANCES THAT YOU KNOW IT WOULDN'T BE PUBLICLY RELEASED AT THE INDIVIDUAL PROVIDER LEVEL MAY HELP THE RESPONSE RATE FOR THIS IS REALLY CRITICAL WE THANK- THE SURVEY AND THAT THAT'S DONE NATIONALLY OF COURSES AFTER THE YEAR- IS CLOSED OF THIS SURVEY THAT WE WOULD BE DURING THE SPRING WOULD BE FOR CALENDAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE THINK IT'S ALSO TIMELY FOR THE VERY REASON THAT AS WE IMPLEMENT RATE ADJUSTMENTS CALENDAR TWENTY TWO WILL HAVE SOME BASELINE DATA ABOUT THAT EX AND SOME WAGES IN IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND SO YOU CAN GO BY TOPIC AND SEE THAT THAT WOULD BE REALLY VALUABLE. I THINK THEY'RE VERY SHORT. THAT MR CHARTER YOU'RE- IS. THE I G. SYSTEM NECESSARILY. HAVE TO GET IN THE WAY OF COLLECTING SOME DATA TODAY- AND THAT THIRD PARTY PERSPECTIVE THAT I MENTIONED TO OF FINDING OUT YOU KNOW THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. CONSUMER EXPERIENCE THE INDIVIDUAL A FAMILY EXPERIENCE. WHAT WITH THE DIRECTOR PROFESSIONALS AND SERVICE COORDINATORS AND SO FORTH- IS ALSO SUBJECT TO- THOSE OTHER AND SEE OUR MODULES THAT I REFERRED TO EARLIER- A COUPLE MINUTES AGO SO. THERE ARE THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE OUTSIDE OF THE CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ITSELF. BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS FIRMLY COMMITTED TO TAKING A WHAT I'LL CALL A WHOLE PERSON VIEW. OUR ENTER THE EXTENT OF THE PEOPLE ENGAGING WHERE FOR MANAGING THE CASE OF ARE THE PEOPLE THAT WERE PROVIDING SERVICES TO- IT'S REALLY NICE OF ALL OF THIS COULD BE THOUGHTFULLY WHILE TIED TOGETHER. SO EVEN THE SURVEY DATA AND INDIVIDUAL SURVEY DATA YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS WILL BEGIN TO ITERATE AND AFTER COULD BE CAPTURED IN A CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND WE WOULD ACTUALLY KNOW HOW PEOPLE ARE FEELING. ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE GETTING. YOU COULD SEE IMMEDIATELY WHETHER WOULD BE BENEFIT TO THAT SO SHORT TERM OPPORTUNITIES LONG TERM GOAL. AND LOTS OF WORK IN THE MIDDLE AND REALLY AGAIN GRATEFUL FOR THE PARTNERSHIPS. THAT ARE GOING TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. I THANK I THINK ALONG THOSE LINES WITH FROM WHEN THAT THE GREAT AND OP. AND I AND I WILL SHARE AN APPRECIATION WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION TO FULLY FUNDING THE RATE STUDY. IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET BUT HIS COMMENT IS THAT HE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THE PRESENT. AND I THINK WE HEARD FROM A NUMBER OF- FRONTLINE. PARENTS AND- EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS OF REGIONAL CENTERS ABOUT WHAT TODAY LOOKS LIKE- JUDY MARKS WORDS WERE THAT SHE HAS TO FIGHT TO GET SERVICES. FROM MARC CLAUS WE HEARD THAT THERE ARE NOT DISRUPTIONS THAT THERE ARE NOT SERVICES. AND I'M CONCERNED THAT WHILE WE ALL ARE APPRECIATIVE OF WHERE WE WELL AS AS YOU SAID. NO WE'RE WE'RE GETTING TO AT THE END OF THE ROAD FOR SOME OF OUR FAMILIES WE CAN'T GET THERE FAST ENOUGH. AND WE'RE NOT GETTING THE SERVICES TODAY AND I BELIEVE THAT'S THE REAL- IMPETUS FOR US TO LOOK TOWARDS ADVANCING THIS RATE STUDY AND FIGURING OUT WHAT IS POSSIBLE AND SO I WILL COME BACK TO MY INITIAL COMMENTS BUT WOULD LOVE TO- FIGURE OUT IF THIS CAN BE ACCELERATED AND THEN FOR US TO EVALUATE WHETHER IT SHOULD BE XCELERATED IS THE SECOND QUESTION BUT BUT I DO WANT TO COME BACK TO ONE FINAL QUESTION BEFORE WE MOVE ON WHICH IS- THIS WAS A POINT IN TIME FOR THE RATE STUDY AND WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION WHETHER THEY THINK OF FUTURE RATE STUDY WILL BE WARRANTED AFTER THE COMPLETION. OF THE INCREASE THAT WE'RE SPEAKING ABOUT AND WHETHER OF REGULAR- RETURN TO THIS IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT- THEY BELIEVE IS NECESSARY FOR US TO KEEP UP TO DATE- WITH THOSE PROVIDER RATE. YEAH YOU CHAIR JIM KNIGHT WITH THE DEPARTMENT DEPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND YOU KNOW SOME OF THE COMMENTS ABOUT LOOKING AT THE SERVICES THAT MAY BE CHANGED AND CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THAT- DURING DURING COVERT NINETEEN AND THAT WE MAY WANT TO LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE CHANGES CARING FOR WORK SO TO THAT EXTENT AND WHEN WE DID JUST TAKE A STEP BACK THE RATE STUDY LOOKED AT SERVICES IN THE REQUIREMENT FOR SERVICES AS THEY EXISTED AT THAT POINT. IN AND MADE SOME COST ASSUMPTIONS THE BUILT MODELS BASED ON THOSE- THOSE REQUIREMENTS. WE WOULD OF LOOK AT IF WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING NEW LOOK AT WHAT IS THE NEW REQUIREMENTS OR NEW SERVICE STRUCTURE THAT WE WANT TO BUILD A MODEL FOR IF YOU WILL. AND IN THAT WE CAN WORK FROM THERE. AS FAR AS REGULAR REVIEW- CERTAINLY OPENS UP THE DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT MAKES SENSE WHETHER IT BE A RATE STUDY. A REVIEW OF THE AVAILABILITY OF PROVIDERS ACCESS AND THOSE TYPES OF THINGS THAT ARE REQUIRED ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL. TO THEN SEE WHAT WOULD BE NECESSARY AND WHAT. ACTIONS WE SHOULD TAKE. ON A REGULAR BASIS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. I APPRECIATE THE I AYE- I WILL REPEAT AGAIN WHAT JORDAN LINDSAY HAD SAID ABOUT THE CUTE STAFFING SHORTAGE TODAY THAT THERE ARE CURRENTLY TWO THOUSAND JOB OPENINGS AND A TWENTY PERCENT. DECREASE FROM PRE PANDEMIC TIMES IT'S THOSE TYPES OF FIGURES THAT REALLY- SHOULD ALLOW US TO LEAN IN. AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO. ADVANCE THIS RATE STUDY- AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND AGAIN WILL. APPRECIATE THE WILLINGNESS TO. ENTER INTO THESE CONVERSATIONS. WITH THAT WE WILL. MOVE ON I WILL THANK ALL OF THE PANELISTS ON CHANNEL FIVE AND WE WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUES SIX. WHICH IS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT OF DISPARITIES WITHIN THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES SYSTEMS. AND STRATEGIES TOWARD EQUITY.

TO ADDRESS THE DISPARITIES AND SERVICE ACCESS AND- QUITY AND OUR SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM- I AM EXTREMELY PROUD OF THE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO FORM- TO REALLY THINK THROUGH WHAT ARE THE ISSUES THE BARRIERS WHAT'S THAT. THAT DRIVERS TO- CHALLENGES THAT FAMILIES- ARE FACING THOSE WHO. MAY NOT SPEAK ENGLISH OR THOSE FROM COMMUNITIES THAT- ARE NOT AS COMFORTABLE- FOR VARIOUS REASONS OF ACCESSING SERVICES OR HAVE HELPING THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND OTHERS UNDERSTAND HOW TO BEST. I'M REALLY MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE TO ENSURE THAT WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES- WE HAVE BEEN BUILDING ON- DIFFERENT INITIATIVES OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS- TO REALLY EXPLORE WHAT ARE THOSE. STRATEGIES INTERVENTIONS AND CURRENT ADDRESSING THE BARRIERS AND REALLY INTERRUPTING- SOME OF THE SYSTEMIC ISSUES THAT WERE SEEN WE STILL HAVE A WAYS TO GO- AND THAT'S WHY YOU'LL SEE THAT IT'S- WE HAVE CONTINUED PROPOSALS. AND ARE. DESPITE TO BILL ON I KNOW OF THE INITIAL THE WE PUT FORWARD- LAST YEAR THAT- WE'RE FINDING IS THERE FOR- FROM BUDGET OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE- ON PAGE THIRTY NINE I BELIEVE IT IS ON PAGE THIRTY NINE THE SUMMARY OF THE DIFFERENT INITIATIVES I'LL JUST POINT OUT NINE OF THOSE INITIATIVES- JUSTIN IN THIS LAST YEAR REALLY WERE CENTERED AROUND RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE COMMUNITY TO THINK THROUGH HOW DO WE REACH INTO THE COMMUNITY AND STARTED DRESSING- THE CONTINUED ISSUES THAT WE'RE FACING-SO MANY INEQUITIES AND- BUT THAT WE'RE FACING IN OUR SYSTEM OUR OUR MULTI PRONGED- WE'RE- WE'RE FACING SOME INEQUITIES TO THOSE WHO ARE ACCESSING SERVICES. I'M STILL COMING IN THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR FOR ASSESSMENT AND SERVICES- AND SOME OF THE INITIATIVES TO ADDRESS- THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE BURKE THE PROFESSIONAL ELIGIBILITY THAT WE WERE ABLE TO PUT FORWARD FOR THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS- BEING ABLE TO- SUPPORT THE LOW TO NO PURCHASE A SERVICE AND OUR CURRENT PROPOSAL IS AN EXAMPLE OF- THAT WE TALKED ON ISSUE TOO WITH REDUCING CASELOAD RATIOS- NOT TO MENTION SOME OF THE NAVIGATOR AND OTHER INITIATIVES- WE ALSO ARE SEEING AN EQUITY OF SPENDING AND ACCESS. OF UTILIZATION OF SERVICES. I SO WE HAVE NO OF A PROPOSED FROM FOR- END OF. HER LIVING IN THE HOME SO WE HAVE PER. THAT ARE- UNFAIR MARC- RIGHT NOW TO SUPPORT- THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND SO LAST YEAR WE HAD- THIRTY TO BE ABLE TO START DEVELOPING A PILOT PROJECT. THAT IS SIMILAR TO SUPPORTIVE LIVING SERVICES TO BE ABLE TO- IT STARTED DRESSING THOSE ISSUES- AND THEN JUST LASTLY I'LL JUST NOTE THAT YOU KNOW WE JUST HAD A REALLY GOOD DISCUSSION. ON THE RATE IMPLEMENTATION AND- REALLY STANDARDIZING THOSE RATES WAS ADDRESSING SEVEN EQUITY- RATES BETWEEN DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS THAT WE HAVE. PARTICULARLY IN COMPARISON OF NEIGHBORING REGIONAL CENTERS- SO WEAK WE DO LOOK FORWARD FOR THAT CONTINUED WORK- I WAS ASKED- IN ONE OF THE QUESTIONS HERE IS THAT- IT. YES SEEKING ADVICE FROM OTHER STATES- WHO CAN SUCCESSFUL IN THIS AREA. YOU KNOW WE ARE ALWAYS OPEN AND MY COUNTERPARTS IN OTHER STATES WE DO MEET AND DISCUSS IMPORTANT ISSUES AND SERVICE ACCESS AND EQUITY AS ONE. CALIFORNIA'S ENTERED INTO A COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE WITH GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO TO ADDRESS. CULTURAL LINGUISTIC COMPETENCY. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO REALLY THE MANY OF THE PROPOSED IN A- AROUND THAT. OF THAT SAD I WILL SAY THAT- DUE TO THE SUPPORTED- THE LEGISLATURE OUR COMMUNITY AND- THE INITIATIVES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S BEEN ABLE TO PUT FORWARD. I'M WE ARE OFTEN SOUGHT BY OTHER STATES TO UNDERSTAND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING AS- IN THIS AREA- WE ARE WE ARE VIEWED. AS A LEADER- IN ADDRESSING AND PUTTING FORWARD IDEAS WE'RE ONE OF THE FIRST STATES TO PUT FORWARD- MAKING SURE THAT WE HAD A SERVICE ACCESS AND EQUITY TALK AND- BRANCH AT THE DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS- PUSHING DOWN SUPPORTS OF THE REGIONAL CENTER LEVEL- BUT THEN THE COMMUNITY- BUT AGAIN WE ALWAYS HAVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR LESSONS LEARNED THERE'S PEARLS OUT THERE THAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING THAT WE CONTINUE TO REMAIN OPEN. AND WANT TO LEARN FROM THOSE BEST PRACTICES AS WELL AS CHERRY NOSE WITH OUR COMMUNITY SO I'LL PAUSE THERE AND- TURN TO MY COLLEAGUES TO. ADDRESS SOME OF THE ADDITIONAL I'M QUESTIONS AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE PLAYED NINETY WALTER ASSISTANT DEPUTY WHO'S GOING TO DO THAT. THANK YOU DIRECTOR. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE RIGHT NOT A WALTER ASSISTANT DEPUTY OF SERVICE ACCESS AND EQUITY. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THE DISBURSEMENTS. STRATEGIES. AND INITIATIVES TOWARDS EQUITY. DO IS TAKEN A MORE PRONGED APPROACH TO REDUCE DISK. BY FIRST BILL. AND CONTINUING TO BUILD TRUST WITH DIVERSE COMMUNITIES. SERVED IN OUR SYSTEM AND LOOKING AT AT THE HEART OF OUR INITIATIVES HAVE BEEN THAT ENGAGEMENT. IN ADDITION TO THE ELEVEN MILLION ANNUALLY IN OUR SERVICE ACCESS pIMPLEMENTED SOME KEY STRATEGIES TO REDUCE THESE DISPARITIES. FIRST EXPANDING COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT WITHIN THE LAST TWO YEARS. WE HAVE FOCUSED ON EFFORTS OF DEEP LISTENING TO HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES ESTABLISHING THE AFRICAN AMERICAN FOCUS GROUP. IN RECOGNITION THAT WE HAD LACK OF REPRESENTATION HONORED YES TASK FORCE THIS MONTH WE CAN GAUGE MEANT HAS INVOLVES HAS INVOLVED INTO MEANINGFUL CONVERSATIONS WITH AFRICAN AMERICAN PARENT LEADERS FAMILY MEMBERS CDOS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS. IT'S BEEN AN INVALUABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO HEAR DIRECTLY FROM COMMUNITY. CREATING NEW PARTNERSHIPS STATEWIDE WITH THEIR NATIVE AMERICAN LEADERS WITH INVESTMENT IN PRIVATE COMMUNITIES TO ESTABLISH MEANINGFUL CONNECTIONS WITHIN THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM TO PRODUCE CULTURALLY RELEVANT PROGRAMMING JARRIEL'S WITH A FOCUS ON EARLY START TO RETURN TRAVEL COMMUNITIES. AND THIRD HOSTING CBO MEETINGS IT BEGAN A FEW YEARS AGO WITH MAYBE TWENTY EIGHT COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. MEETING ON A QUARTERLY BASIS THAT HAS GROWN OUT TO OVER SIXTY COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS MEETING MONTHLY SHARING STRATEGIES THEIR STRATEGIES. PROVING EQUITY IN OUR SYSTEM. LISTENING GOES BOTH WAYS THESE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO CHEER AND ALSO TO LEARN. R. CBO'S REFLECT CALIFORNIA'S RICH DIVERSITY WITH A FOCUS OF OVER EIGHTEEN ETHNICITIES REPRESENTED WITH A FOCUS OF LANGUAGES FOURTEEN PLUS LANGUAGES ARE REPRESENTED ON THIS MONTHLY CALL. ANOTHER STRATEGY THE DEPARTMENT IS FOCUSED ON IS DEVELOPING CULTURALLY COMPETENT AND FLEXIBLE SERVICE MODELS. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE COORDINATED FAMILY SUPPORT SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO LIVE IN MULTI GENERATIONAL HOMES AND PROVIDING ADDITIONAL SERVICES BEYOND BREAST THERE. OF COURSE A LOT HAS BEEN SPOKEN ABOUT- WORKFORCE EXPANDING OUR WORK FORCE WITH AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE PILING A BILINGUAL KEY DIFFERENTIALS. BUT THIS ALSO EXPERIENCE INDIVIDUAL CHOICE SO NOT ONLY ARE WE EXPANDING THE WORKFORCE BUT WE'RE ALSO ENSURING THAT FAMILIES HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMUNICATE AND WORK WITH THE SERVICE PROVIDER THAT MEETS THEIR BOTH CULTURAL AND LANGUAGE NEEDS. THIRD STRAIGHTENING TRUSTED PARTNERSHIPS IMPLEMENTING PROJECTS BACK ON NOW NEW PROGRAMS LIKE THE COMMUNITY NAVIGATOR PROGRAM PARTNERING WITH FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS TO IMPLEMENT A PROJECT STATEWIDE. IS AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF OUR SYSTEM ENHANCE SERVICE COORDINATION ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO TAKE WHAT OCCURRED OR HAS BEEN DEVELOPED IN OUR SERVICE ACCESS AND EQUITY GRANT PROGRAM TO BE AFFECTIVE STATEWIDE MODEL. AND FOR EXPANDING LANGUAGE ACCESS POINTS MULTI LINGUAL POLICY BUDGET AND GRANT BRIEFINGS AB HELPED TO RAISE UP DIVERSE VOICES IN OUR SYSTEM TO ALSO RAISE AWARENESS IN NATIVE LANGUAGE. MOST RECENTLY IN THE DEPARTMENT HAD HOSTED BOTH A VIRTUAL POLICY BRIEFING AS WELL AS A BIGGER CONFERENCE CENTER GRANT PROGRAM THE FIRST TIME THAT OCCURRED IN OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ATTENDEES ATTENDED BACK CONFERENCE ALONG. WE'VE SEEN A SHIFT IN THE PAST FEW YEARS TOWARDS A HEIGHTENED AWARENESS OF SYSTEMIC RACISM AND STRUCTURAL INEQUITIES IN OUR SOCIETY ALONG WITH A STARK ADVANCEMENTS IN STATE AT THE STATE LEVEL TO ADDRESS UNDERLYING INEQUITIES. EDS IS INVESTED IN SUSTAIN FOCUS ON CLOSING THE GAPS AND BECOMING A MORE CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY COMPETENT SYSTEM. BUTIT DOESN'T AND IN ONE MOMENT AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS AN ONGOING PROCESS THAT REQUIRES LISTENING CLOSELY TO OUR DIVERSE COMMUNITIES AND CONSISTENTLY AND CONSTANTLY RE CALIBRATING AS WE MOVE OUR SYSTEM TOWARDS. BEING A MORE EQUITABLE SYSTEM FOR EVERYONE WE SERVE. ANECDOTALLY SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT MAY BE CONTRIBUTING TO INEQUITIES ARE BIASED BETTER BUILT INTO OUR SYSTEM TOOLS AND PROCEDURES FOR INTAKE INELIGIBILITY. AND EVEN AT LINGUISTIC VARIATIONS IN TRANSLATIONS RATHER THAN HOLDING MEETINGS AND DISCUSSIONS AND PRIMARY LANGUAGE. CONSISTENT WITH THE AGENCY'S FOCUS OUTLINED IN RECENT BUDGET RELEASED. THE NEW OPPORTUNITIES PROVIDED IN OUR BUDGET OUR INVESTMENTS IN PROGRAMS AND EFFORTS THAT DEEP AND ARE FOCUSED ON THE WHOLE PERSON WITH THE HOPE OF ADDRESSING INEQUITIES LAID BARE BY THE PANDEMIC. IN OUR UPCOMING EVALUATION THE DISPARITY GRANTS OUR HOPE IS THAT WORKING WITH GEORGETOWN WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO A FEW THINGS. REFINE AND DEVELOP OUR SERVICE ACCESS AND EQUITY GRANT PROGRAM. WITHOUT HOPE OF LOOKING AT SOME OF THE PROJECT STATEWIDE THAT HAVE AFFECTED OUTCOMES. THAT ARE HELP US TO PRIORITIES PRIORITIZE WHAT SOME OF THE POPULATIONS ACTIVITIES ARE PROJECTS MAY BE INDEPENDENT EVALUATION WILL ANALYZE THE EXISTING GRANT PROGRAM BUT ALSO HELP WITH RECOMMENDATIONS ON QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE MEASURES. INCLUDING METRICS AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS TO THE DEPARTMENT PRIORITIZE ACTIVITIES AND POPULATIONS THAT GRANTEES SHOULD FOCUS ON. EDS IS LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH GEORGETOWN NATIONAL CENTER OF CULTURAL LINGUISTIC COMPETENCE AND THE EXPERTISE THAT THEY BRING TO THIS IMPORTANT WORK. IMPROVING EQUITY IN OUR SYSTEM REQUIRES ONGOING EFFORTS THAT ARE PURPOSEFUL COLLABORATIVE COMPREHENSIVE. AND FLEXIBLE DDS IS COMMITTED TO BUILDING A MORE EQUITABLE SYSTEM TO DEVELOP POLICY THAT'S RESPONSIVE TO THE DIVERSE NEEDS OF ALL OF THE FAMILIES THAT WE SERVE. THANK YOU NOT BE HAPPY TO TAKE FURTHER QUESTIONS THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM DOCTOR LOVELL. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR ARAMBULA AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM VICKY LOVELL CHIEF OF THE DEPARTMENT'S RESEARCH EVALUATION OF PRODUCTS BRANCH I WOULD TRUST TO ACHIEVE IN THE AGENDA REGARDING DISPARITIES. YES THE CASHIER REGULAR TRACKING OF BASIC MEASURES OF SERVICE EQUITY WITH FIFTEEN SIXTEEN DATA. DATA OR THE YEAR BEFORE THE SERVICE ACCESS AND EQUITY GRANT PROGRAM BEGAN. THIS ALLOWS US TO IDENTIFY AREAS OF THE GREATEST CHALLENGE IN ACCESSING SERVICES. CAN BE REDUCED AND TO SEE THE IMPACT OVER TIME OF ALL OF THE DEPARTMENTS EQUITY PROJECTS. WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN PERSON SURVEYS FOR THE NATIONAL CORE INDICATORS PROJECT WE'RE NOW COLLECTING DATA ON INDIVIDUAL LOOKS VERY HANDSOME SATISFACTION INDICATORS THAT CAN BE ANALYZED BY ETHNICITY FOR EACH REGIONAL CENTER. THE DEPARTMENT ALSO TRYING TO DISCREET ANALYSES TO INFORM SANDERS STANDING OF DISPARITIES IN SPECIFIC AREAS OVER TIME SUCH. AS ACCESS TO RESPITE SERVICES WHO ARE DEAF. REGISTER SERVICE OR LAST ED CHAU PROGRESS TOWARD EQUITY FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS ASIANS AND HISPANICS FROM FIFTEEN SIXTEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE FOR MOST AGE GROUPS CONSUMERS FROM ASIAN COMMUNITIES AGE THREE TO TWENTY ONE LIVING% AT HOME ARE NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS IN PROGRESS. AND DESPITE THIS PROGRESS AVERAGE POS FOR AFRICAN AMERICANINFANTS LAGGED BEHIND BUT WHITES RECEIVE AN AVERAGE PEOPLE ASK FOR HISPANIC ADULTS LIING AT HOME IS APPROXIMATELY OF THIS TREND WAS THE INCIDENTS THE COORDINATED FAMILY SUPPORT SERVICES PROJECT THE PROGRAM TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT DIRECTOR BARGE AND MENTIONED. GAPS ALSO NARROWED FROM FIFTEEN SIXTEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE FOR MOST STATEWIDE DISPARITY MEASURES INCLUDING SERVICE FUNDING FOR SUPPORTED INDEPENDENT LIVING AND PARTICIPATION AND SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS. SOME MEASURES THAT NOT SHOW IMPROVEMENT ADAPTIVE SKILLS TRAINING REMAINS A CHALLENGE. AND EVEN REFUSED MEASURES INDICATE PROGRESS TOWARD EQUITY EQUALITY OF FUNDING WE ARE AWARE THAT WE MAY STILL NEED TO ENHANCE SERVICES THAT ARE PREFERRED BY SOME ETHNIC COMMUNITY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- CHRISTOPHER O'NEILL WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD TO THE PRESENTATION. NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM SUNDAY PADDOCK WITH THE L. L. AND THANK YOU DOCTOR ARAMBULA I'M SEND YOU PICK FROM THE L. A. O. YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF COMMENTS TO ADD ON THIS ISSUE THE- DEPARTMENT- PROVIDED A LOT OF GREAT INFORMATION JUST NOW- IN THEIR TESTIMONY. I THINK ONE- POINTS WE WOULD WANT TO MAKE LOOKING AHEAD IS- WE AGREE WITH DR- I'M SORRY WITH DIRECTOR BARGE MEANT THAT A LOT OF NEW INITIATIVES HAVE BEEN STARTED UP- REAL THAT ARE SORT OF TARGETED TOWARD THIS ISSUE OF EQUITY AND REDUCING DISPARITIES IN THE SYSTEM PARTICULARLY IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. I'M INCLUDING EVERYTHING FROM COMMUNITY NAVIGATORS TO REGIONAL CENTER IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING- SO- WE WOULD SUGGEST AT MINIMUM CONSIDERATION OF EVALUATING THE EFFECT OF THESE RECENT EFFORTS ALONG WITH THE- EVALUATION THAT DDS IS ALREADY DOING. ON ITS- DISPARITIES GRANTS- TO SORT OF SEE WHICH OF THESE DIFFERENT EFFORTS- ACTUALLY HAS AN EFFECT NOW A CAUTIONARY NOTE IS THAT IT MAY BE HARD BECAUSE- BECAUSE A LOT IS BEING THROWN AT THE ISSUE- IT MAYBE IT SORT OF DIFFICULT TO DISCERN- YOU KNOW WHICH WHICH EFFORTS ARE HAVING. THE DESIRED EFFECT ON WHICH INDIVIDUALS AND WHICH REGIONAL CENTERS BUT TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THIS KIND OF INFORMATION CAN BE DISCERNED IT'LL BE HELPFUL IN TARGETING RESOURCES. TO THE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT- POLICY INTERVENTIONS AND- AS THE DEPARTMENT- REPRESENTATIVES WERE TALKING ONE QUESTION THAT CAME TO MY MIND IS WHETHER THE STUDY THEY'RE DOING WITH. GEORGETOWN ON THE DISPARITY GRANTS COULD POTENTIALLY BE EXPANDED TO CONSIDER SOME OF THESE NEW POLICY INTERVENTIONS THAT WERE. INCLUDED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM ELIZABETH GOMEZ DIRECTOR OF THE INTEGRATED COMMUNITY COLLABORATIVE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY TESTIMONY TODAY. MY NAME IS ELIZABETH GOMEZ AND I AM THE MOTHER OF TWO BOYS SERVE BY THE REGIONAL CENTER SERVICES. MY SON FIFTEEN YEARS OLD HAS DOWN SYNDROME I AM ALSO THE DIRECTOR OF THE INTEGRATED COMMUNITY COLLABORATIVE. YEAH I C. C. COMMUNITY IMPACT OTHER ORDERS HER PARENTS AND SELF ADVOCATES WHO HELP THEIR PEERS SPECIALLY IN THE LATINO COMMUNITY. WE HELP NAVIGATE THE COMPLEX REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM. WE USE ORGANIC RELATIONSHIP BASED COMMUNITY OUTREACH REALLY WORK OF CULTIVATING TRUST. TRUST PLACED IN US BY OUR COMMUNITY MY TESTIMONY TODAY REFLECTS THAT TRUST THAT TRUST OF OUR COMMUNITY WHO IS SEEKING RESPECT VALIDATION AND A FAIR OPPORTUNITY TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. I FIRST WOULD LIKE TO THANK. CORRECT APARTMENT FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE GOOD ALLOWING THE GUIDELINES THAT COULD BE OPEN FOR PARENTS LIKE I WON THE POINT TO GET OTHER ORDERS TO BECOME PART OF THE SOLUTION WE ARE REALLY GRATEFUL FOR HER LEADERSHIP. OUR ORGANIZATION IS ONE OF THE CBO SCORE RECEIVED A GRANT FROM THE S. TO HELP REDUCE RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES. WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. IN HELPING FAMILIES WITHIN THE ALLOCATED REGIONAL CENTERS THAT WE HAVE WORKED WITH IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS. OUR EFFORTS ARE MEASURABLE. CAPABLE AND CAN BE REPLICATED YOU FOR ABLE TO CONTINUE. RECENT DATA SHOWS THAT IN ALL EXCEPT FOR OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS THAT THE NOSE RECEIVED AS THAN HALF THE AMOUNT OF SERVICES THAT WHAT FAMILIES GET. DISPARITIES EXIST EVEN WHEN I KNOW THE SYSTEM COMPARES WHITE AND LATINO ADULTS LIVING AT HOME JUST THAT THE SIX WE ARE IN C. HUMAN FACES BEHIND THOSE NUMBERS THESE HEARINGS YEAR AFTER YEAR WITH THE STORIES OF PEOPLE WHO IN ADDITION TO DISPARITIES IN ACCESSING SERVICES ALSO FACE INTIMIDATION RETALIATION FOR JUST SHOWING HERE AND TESTIFYING YOU PERSPECTIVE AND LIVED EXPERIENCE OF PARENTS. LEADING ORGANIZATION THAT IS FROM THE COMMUNITY THAT FACES DISPARITIES EVERYDAY. HERE ARE VERY SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW THE STATE SHOULD RESPOND IN A CONCRETE WAY TO REDUCE RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES. RECOMMENDED AN EQUITY PLAN OF ACTION WE WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT ANY PLANS THAT ARE DEVELOPED MUST THINK YOU FROM THE BEGINNING AND AT EVERY LEVEL INVOLVEMENT OF THE PEOPLE AFFECTED BY THIS DISPARITIES. PLEASE DO NOT MAKE ALL THE DECISIONS AND THEN ASK US FOR A POINT OF VIEW. WE NEED TO CONNECT THE SYSTEM TO THE COMMUNITY IT SERVES. WITH TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. THE SYSTEM LACKS EMPATHY. AND IS SET ON COMPLIANCE IS SUPPOSED TO PERSON CENTER OUTCOMES. WHEN THE FAMILY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE WAY THEY ARE TREATED BY A REGIONAL CENTER STAFF IT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. IF THE PARENTS SAID THAT THEY WERE INTIMIDATED OR RETALIATED AGAINST SOMETHING MUST BE DONE INSTEAD OF BLAMING. THE PARENTS WERE SPEAKING UP FOR THEMSELVES OR MAKING IT THEIR FAULT. THERE NEEDS TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED MEMBER THE REGIONAL CENTERS THAT DISPARITIES STILL EXIST INSTEAD OF MAKING EXCUSES WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO BRING ABOUT RESOLUTIONS. REGIONAL CENTERS. SHOULDN'T SEE GROUPS LIKE OURS AS PARTNERS NOT ENEMIES. ARE YOU ARE VOICE AND TELL US WHAT WE SHOULD NOT SAY WORK WITH US AS EQUALS. WE NEED TO ENGAGE IN CONTINUE TO FIND ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE THE TRUST OF THE COMMUNITY AND NOT RELY ON HIRING SOME MORE REGIONAL CENTER STAFF THAT QUICKLY BECOME PART OF THE EXISTING CULTURE. AND RE PERCEIVED AS THE EXTENSION OF THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM. EVALUATION SHOULD BE DONE OF ALL FUNDED PROGRAMS INCLUDING REGIONAL CENTER PROGRAMS NOT JUST THE PARENT TO PARENT YOUR PROGRAMS TO SEE WHETHER THE DISPARITY FUNDS ARE BEING WELL SPENT. PLEASE REFORM BE UNFAIR HIRE LAWYERS IN HEARING SPECIALIST. ON TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO FIGHT US. WHEN ALL WE'RE ASKING FOR SERVICES FOR A DISABLED CHILD. AND WE HAD NO IMPLICIT BIAS AND CULTURAL COMPETENCY TRAINING TO MAKE THE DENTON DISPARITIES. IN BALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN THE REGIONAL CENTER SOME FAMILIES MUST BE CORRECTED FIRST. WE ARE SAD OUR COMMUNITY IS THIS SUPPORT ROBERTS AT THE SUFFERING FROM IT AND THEN MAKE. AND WE APPRECIATE THE DIRECTIVES. HOWEVER THEY ONLY GAVE MORE POWER TO REGIONAL CENTERS AND MAKE FAMILIES SHOW UP MONTH AFTER MONTH TO BEG FOR SERVICES. SOME OF THE SERVICES CAME VERY LATE. TODAY FAMILIES ARE TOLD THAT THERE IS NO MORE NEED FOR THE SERVICE OR FOR THIS HELP SINCE THEN IT HAS GONE IN CHILDREN ARE BACK IN SCHOOL. YET THIS IS NOT TRUE. BUT WE ARE STILL VERY MUCH INDEPENDENT AGAIN FACING DIFFERENT CHALLENGES. BUT WE DO NOT GIVE UP IN FACT WE ARE INSPIRED WE'RE EMPOWERING AND UNITING OUR COMMUNITY TO STAND UP FOR THE RIGHTS BECAUSE IT IS UNACCEPTABLE. FOR THIS TO CONTINUE WELL WE KNOW THERE'S HELP AND WELL INTENTIONED PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BRING BALANCE. WE HOPE YOU CAN HELP US. SEPTEMBER ARAMBULA YOU COME FROM OUR OUR COMMUNITY AND I KNOW THE COMPLETE THE COMMITTEE UNDERSTANDS OUR CONCERNS WE'RE HAPPY TO MEET WITH YOU AND DISCUSS THIS AND MANY MORE IDEAS THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO THAT. PROCESS ME OUT I AM ABLE SALAS THEY'LL PUT TWENTY THAT. CRISIS NECK WE'LL HEAR FROM ME WHY WING A- DIRECTOR OF ARC. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS AMY WESTLING AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ASSOCIATION OF REGIONAL CENTER EIGHTEEN ALSO KNOWN AS ARCA ARCA WORKS WITH ALL OF THE STATE TWENTY ONE RESULTS. I WANT START BY THANKING. TEREBRA AND THE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR YOUR TYPE TODAY AS WELL AS COMMITTEE STAFF FOR A COMPREHENSIVE AND FOUGHT FOR GENDER. I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS THIS CRITICAL TOPIC. I APPRECIATE THAT THE AGENDA INCLUDED NOTATIONS FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE NOT ONLY RELATED TO THE HIGH LEVEL DATA IN THE AREA OF DISPARITIES BUT ALSO THE COMPLEXITY OF IT. FOR THE SECOND TIME I WOULD LIKE TO DIVE A LITTLE BIT DEEPER INTO THE DATA FOR THOSE FOR QUITE AND THOSE WHO ARE LIKE YOU KNOW LOOKING AT PUBLIC THEIR FAMILY. YOUR TWENTY WE KNOW THAT CHILDREN ZERO TO THREE BUT HOME WITH THEIR FAMILIES READ ALSO CENTER SPENT APPROXIMATELY 4% MORE FROM LATINO CHILDREN THEN ON WHITE CHILDREN. FOR CHILDREN AND SCHOOL AGED YOUNG ADULTS FROM THREE TO TWENTY ONE REGIONAL CENTER SPENT 18% LESS ON WHICH YOU KNOW SPENT ON MY CHILDREN. AND FOR THOSE LIVING IN MOBILE OVER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE REGIONAL CENTER SPENT APPROXIMATELY 18% LESS ON WHICH EMAILS BUT ON THE PHOTOS WERE WHITE. I WAS NOW TO MEET A THIS VERY SIX. BUT RATHER TO HIGHLIGHT. THERE ARE IN OF OUR SYSTEM WORLD SPRING. AND THE STRANGER IN THE AREAS OF RESPITE AND EARLY SO. AND I WOULD QUORUM ALL TO LOOK AT WHY ARE THOSE AREAS. AND HOW CAN WE BUILD ON EXPECTS IT MEANS VERY OF SERVICES ARE DELIVERED BY VOTERS IN THE FAMILY HELLO. IT'S SERVICES THE FAMILY IS THAT FAMILY IS SPECIFICALLY FOR RESPITE AND PERSONAL ASSISTANCE CAN SELECT CARE GIVERS BEFORE APPROVAL BUT THEY ARE KNOWN TO THE FAMILY THAT PERHAPS. OUR EXTENDED FAMILY. WHAT THANK THAT WE CAN. AND GROW UP. FROM BELIEVE AREAS WHERE WE ARE SEEING. EQUITY CONSTRAINTS. I WAS ASKED TODAY TO DISCUSS WHAT ARE THE REGIONAL CENTERS PRIORITIES FOR DISPARITY REDUCTION AND HELPING THE STATE RESPOND IN A CONCRETE CONCRETE WAY TO ADVANCE THE- OUR PRIORITIES ARE VERY SIMPLE WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT EACH PERSON HAS THE SERVICE SALES. TO MEET THEIR UNIQUE NEEDS. THANK YOU FOR ACCESS TO INDIVIDUALIZED SERVICES THIS IS NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL SERVICE MODEL. BUT- SERVICES THAT MEET ONE PERSON STATES MAY NOT MEET ANOTHER GROUPS AND ART OF THE SECRET. IS THE ADVANCEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF SERVICES THAT MEET. A VARIETY OF PEOPLE THREE. IN ORDER TO DEVELOP- SERVICES WE NEED TO BE CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE AND WE BELIEVE THAT INVESTMENTS IN THINGS SUCH AS BILINGUAL STIPENDS HELP A MAN FLEE WITH THE BALLOT. BROADER AND MORE ROBUST SERVICE PROVIDER NETWORK THAT WILL MEET THE FLAG. IN TERMS OF ACTIONABLE STEPS SEVERAL STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN ALREADY. WHICH PARKER PREVIOUSLY ADVOCATED FOR THESE INCLUDE THE REDUCTION OF CASELOAD RATIOS. THE EXPANSION OF WHAT WORKS IN THE DISPARITY GRANT PROGRAM THROUGH THE STATE WIDE EXPANSION OF THE ENHANCE ITS LOAD RATIO PROJECT THE RESTORATION OF SOCIAL RECREATIONAL YEAH. ADDITIONALLY DIRECTOR BURGEONING NOTED OTHER INVESTMENTS THAT BEGAN IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR SUCH IS THE COMMITTEE NAVIGATOR PROGRAM IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING AND PROVISIONAL ELIGIBILITY TO NAME A FEW. OTHER THAN THAT WE CAN- AGREE. ON WHAT MEASURES WERE GOING TO USE TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TWENTY PROJECTS TO A VALUE FOR YOUR SYSTEM FROM AN EQUITY PERSPECTIVE. AND THIS IS A COP OUT THIS IS REALLY AN INTEREST IN IDENTIFYING HOW ARE WE GOING TO MEASURE WHETHER WE'RE MEETING THE MARK. WHEN IT COMES TO PURCHASE OF SERVICE AND SERVICE ACCESS ROUTE INTO EIGHT. AND OTHER FACTORS THAT GO BEYOND SPENDING BECAUSE ONCE WE IDENTIFY THOSE MEASURES THOSE INTERVENTIONS TO IMPROVE IN ALL OF THOSE AREAS WILL BECOME MORE THE STATE AS THE LOOKS TO PERFORMANCE THROUGH WITH THIS GRANTSBURG. FOCUSING ATTENTION ON PROJECT. BROUGH THE PROGRAM AS THEY WENT THEMSELVES TO YOU IF I. MEDICAL OF DISK IMPACTS AND LATER REPLICATION THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE FOR THE SOUTH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WILL BRING THAT BACK TO THE CHAIR FOR COMMENTS AND- FIRST I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT AND APPRECIATE ELIZABETH GOMEZ AND- I AM GRATEFUL THAT DIRECTOR PARCHMAN IS INCLUSIVE AND- INTENTIONAL ABOUT INCLUDING VOICES WHO. DON'T NORMALLY GET INCLUDED INTO NECESSARY CONVERSATIONS THAT MATTER FOR- ALL OF THE CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE INTERACTING WITH OUR SYSTEMS. AND I BELIEVE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE WERE IDENTIFYING AND CALLING OUT THE GLARING NATURE OF THE DISPARITIES THAT WE SEE. AND WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN A SERIES OF CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT HOW WE GET TO A DISABILITY EQUITY PLAN OF ACTION. AND WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CREATE THAT STATEWIDE LEADERSHIP INITIATIVE AS WELL AS HELP TO DEFINE WHAT SOME OF THESE. BASIC METRICS THAT WE CAN AGREE UPON TO MEASURE OUR PROGRESS AS WE GO FORWARD AS WELL AS CREATING A TIMETABLE FOR THOSE MILESTONES. TO ACHIEVE THE GREATER EQUITY THAT WE ARE REACHING FOR AND MY HOPE IS THAT TOGETHER WE CAN DEVELOP THIS ROBUST. AND PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU THE ADMINISTRATION AND AGENCY AND GOVERNOR'S OFFICE SO THAT WE ALTERNATELY WILL BE ADVANCING EQUITY WITHIN OUR- DD SYSTEM AND- AM QUITE APPRECIATIVE OF THE MULTIPLE INVESTMENTS WE'VE BEEN MAKING TO- ADDRESS THIS AND WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON THE ALEJO'S QUESTIONS ABOUT THE STUDY AND THE RELATIONSHIP WITH GEORGETOWN. SO- WHILE WE LOOK TO FOLLOW UP WITH CONVERSATIONS ON THE DISABILITY EQUITY PLAN OF ACTION- WOULD ALSO. LIKE TO ASK TODAY ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP WITH GEORGETOWN AND WHETHER THEY COULD HELP TO PLAY A ROLE- IN-LOOKING FORWARD TOWARDS. ACTION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR NANCY BIRDS MEN- I WE CAN CERTAINLY HAVE- CONVERSATIONS WITH GEORGETOWN- BUT I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS UNDERSTAND WHAT THE SCOPE OF- FURTHERING THE STUDY AND THE EXPANSION OF WORK WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE- I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT FOR US TO SEE WHAT GEORGETOWN IS PRODUCING UNDER REVIEW THAT THEY HAVE CURRENTLY- AND BUT HAPPY TO HAVE FURTHER CONVERSATIONS. WITH GEORGETOWN AND- AT I UNDERSTAND KIND OF ARTICLE IN WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO ACHIEVE. I LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND AGAIN JUST THANK YOU FOR- WORKING WITH OUR OFFICE. WITH THAT I WILL THANK VERY MUCH- THESE PANELISTS WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE SEVEN. WE WILL HAVE SEVEN PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL KARLA CASTANEDA CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR BRIAN WINFIELD CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR WITH DDS. FOLLOWED BY CHRISTOPHER I DEAL WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON THE PADDOCK WITH POLIO- GILDO GARON DIRECTOR OF OUTREACH AND LEADERSHIP TRAINING FOR DISABILITY VOICES UNITED. ANDY IMPARATO EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA AND MICI A GATES EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR KERN REGIONAL CENTER LET'S PLEASE BEGIN WITH MISS CASTANEDA WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR CARLA BECAUSE THEN THE OTHER DEPARTMENT FELT LITTLE SERVICES- WE'LL START WITH ADDRESSING THEQUESTIONS IN THE AGENDA- THE AGENDA ALREADY INCLUDES A SUMMARY OF THE EXPENDITURES FOR COPELAND. NINETEEN SO I'LL KIND OF EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW WE CAME UP WITH THOSE PROJECTIONS ARE YOU FOR A LITTLE BIT EARLY YOUR COP COMMENTS ABOUT OUR DATA SYSTEM RESTRICTIONS. ON WHAT WE DID WAS WE LOOKED AT THE EXPENDITURE TRENDS UP TO BEGINNING FOR THE PANDEMIC LOOK FOR JUST SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE DIFFERENCES INCREASES OR DECREASES. IN EXPENSE AS OF MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY AND TRACKED THAT TRACK FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS- WITHOUT WE DID SEE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN SOME OF THE- CATEGORIES OF EXPENDITURES THAT YOU SEE IN THE AGENDA- USING THAT METHODOLOGY WE'RE PROJECTING APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION. IN COMPANY MAKES MANAGERS IN THE CURRENT YEAR IN TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX LANE IN THE BUDGET YEAR. FOR PURCHASE OF SERVICES. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE SEE AND PROTECTING WHICH CAN. THAT LINK ENERGY. RELATED TO THE LACK IN THE DATA. WHICH WHICH SEE BUT DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. FLAG THAT THAT INFORMATION IS SERVICE- AND EACH CYCLE WE DELIVER THE MOST RECENT CLAIM STATUS THEN ADJUST ACCORDINGLY. TO DATE WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE TOTAL BUDGET- RATHER SHIFTING CATEGORIES OF EXPENDITURES. ON THE STATE UP CRICKET SIDE OF THE CURRENT YEAR HAS FIFTEEN MILLION IF THERE WERE NEED FOR SEARCH ACTIVITY. TO DATE WE HAVE NOT HAD TO ACTIVATE THAT ACTIVITY- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY AN ADJUSTER FOR A YEAR. ARE ANY OUTSTANDING IN THE BUDGET YEAR- THE COMMITTEE HAD ASKED ABOUT SOME OF THE CHARACTERISTICS THAT WE HAD SEEN IN SOME OF THE INFECTION AND MORTALITY RATES. OF EARLY IN THE PANDEMIC THE DEPARTMENT WITH SOCIAL SERVICES AND OUR DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO PROVIDE PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT TO PROVIDERS AND REGIONAL CENTERS OF ALL FAMILIES. AND WE'RE SO PROUD OF THE PARTNERSHIP WITH ALL OF THOSE ACTIVITIES AS WE IDENTIFY ISSUES EARLY AND TRY TO FIND OPTIONS FROM FOR MAINTAINING SERVICES AND MAINTAIN THOSE SAFELY. THAT THE- ON PAGE ONE THIRTY PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT CUMULATIVE DATA ON INSPECTIONS AND UNFORTUNATELY THE DEATH RATE. WHAT WE START EARLY ON WAS- A LARGER PROPORTION OF THOSE IN CONGREGATE SETTINGS- BUT AT THE STATE I DON'T KNOW AND- THE WORLD ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED MORE TOOLS TO ADDRESS THE PANDEMIC. WE SAW THAT WHILE THEIR WORK TO UNIT FUNCTONS THE PROPORTION OF DEATHS FROM. DIDN'T CONTINUE TO INCREASE- SO WHAT WE'RE HOPEFUL IS WE FEEL MUCH MORE PREPARED IF THERE ARE SUCH A GREAT WAVES. AND WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS TO ADDRESS ANY OF THOSE UNMET NEEDS. ONE OF THE OPTIONS THAT CAME FROM SOME OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS WAS LOOKING AT A CLOCK SPEED OF SERVICES HELLO FREE FOR NOT PROVIDENTIAL SERVICES. AND WHAT THAT ALLOWED WAS GIVING PROVIDERS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO TRY TO PROVIDE OTHER OTHER NEEDS. TO MEET THE NEEDS OF CONSUMERS IN THE SAME WAY IN IN DIFFERENT- POTENTIALLY- REYES OR ACTUAL DIFFERENT SERVICES. WHAT WE SAW AS THE PANDEMIC BUT ON WAS ACTUALLY KIND OF A CONFERENCE ON A WHAT THAT ALTERNATIVES. TO USING MORE REMOTE SERVICE. BOB YEAH ALLOWED ME OF OUR OUR BY AND OUR PROVIDER OR THE USE OF THAT TECHNOLOGY WHICH WAS ONE OF THE UP SIDES AS WELL AS THE DOWNSIDE OF PROVIDING SERVICES DURING THE PANDEMIC- THE COLLABORATIVE SPIRIT OF OUR COMMUNITY DEFINITELY HELPS TO STAY ON TOP OF WHATEVER THOSE CHANGING NEEDS ARE- MAKING THAT SIGNIFICANT CHANGE AND IN THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY IT WILL IMPROVE THE COMMUNICATION IT ALLOWED FOR GREATER STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT MORE FREQUENT MORE PARTICIPATION. AND THEN IT ALSO ABOUT FOLKS TO DEVELOP NEW SKILLS SO WHILE SOME INDIVIDUALS IN SOME PROVIDERS DID IDENTIFY THAT REMOTE SERVICES IN THE USED TO BACK TECHNOLOGY. EXPANDED THEIR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IT PROVIDED FLEXIBILITY IN SCHEDULING OF ONE OF THE EXAMPLES THERE IS FROM OUR EARLY START SERVICE PROVIDERS. THEY AND THE FAMILIES WERE ABLE TO INCREASE THAT SCHEDULING FLEXIBILITY SO MORE OFTEN THEY WERE ABLE TO ACTUALLY CONNECT- BUT A LOT FOR SOME OF THE COACHING OPPORTUNITIES. IMPLEMENTING STRATEGIES THAT WILL HELP SUPPORT THE CHILDREN. BUT THE DOWNSIDE OF THAT TECHNOLOGY WAS IT HIGHLIGHTED THE DIGITAL DIVIDE THAT CONTINUES TO EXIST SO I'M LOOKING AT MORE EFFORTS TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS IN THAT AREA. OUR AND THEN OF COURSE AS WE EMERGE FROM THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY- WHAT WE LEARNED WHAT'S FOR SOME INDIVIDUALS THE REMOTE SERVICES WORK WHILE. OTHERS DEFINITELY PREFER IN PERSON AND ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO. THAT INCREASING TRACKING IT WILL DISSIPATE. THERE WILL ALSO BE A FACTOR OF THE OF THE COMMUNITY THAT ONCE A BLANK- FIRST WE LOOK FORWARD TO IT'S CAN GET. AS WE ARE ADDRESSED CHANGE NEEDS THANK YOU. NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM BRIAN ONE FIELD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AT A MISSED CATCH IN A COVERED ALL THE QUESTIONS THANK YOU. CHRISTOPHER I DEAL WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- CHRIS SO NOTED PARTNER FINDS NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD TO THE PRESENTATION SONYA PADDOCK- HELLO. WE DON'T HAVE- MANY SPARROWS SPECIFIC COMMENTS OR OR RECOMMENDATIONS THE PRIMARY- IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO RAISE I GUESS IS JUST THAT THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT KOBE NINETEEN WILL REALLY BE A LONG TERM. ISSUE EVEN IF IT'S NOT AS EXTREME AS IT HAS BEEN- OVER THESE PAST TWO YEARS AND SO IF IT DOES BECOME SOMETHING MORE AKIN TO THE FLU- ANNUAL FLU. MANY OF THE INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WILL BE AT HIGHER RISK OF DISEASE OR SERIOUS ILLNESS- DUE TO UNDERLYING HEALTH CONDITIONS OR THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THEIR LIVING SITUATIONS SUCH AS LIVING IN A CONGREGATE LIVING SETTING- SO WE WOULD JUST EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF- DDS IN REGIONAL CENTRES CONSIDERING HOW TO PLAN AND PREPARE- PREVENTATIVE SPAHN TO. TO DISEASE WHETHER IT'S- INSURING PEOPLE DO HAVE GOOD ACCESS TO PPP- ACCESS TO TESTING AND BOOSTER SHOTS- INTERESTED SUPPORT FOR SOCIAL DISTANCING HER HAVING- ACCESS TO THE TYPES OF COMMUNICATIONS THAT- IS- CASTANEDA MENTIONED- IF THEY DO NEED TO RECEIVE SERVICES IN A REMOTE FASHION- MORE EMERGENCY COORDINATION- SUPPORT WAS APPROVED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET FOR- REGIONAL CENTERS AND GDS SO WE WOULD EXPECT- THAT. THESE GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS WOULD BE IT WOULD BE DOING EXACTLY THIS. TYPE OF PLANNING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT WE WILL FROM THE BUILDER. WITH THIS VOICES UNITED. HI MY NAME IS GILBERT HIT ON AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF OUTREACH AND LEADERSHIP TRAINING FOR DISABILITY VOICES UNITED I AM ALSO THE MOM OF THREE YOUNG CHILDREN TWO OF WHOM HAVE DISABILITIES. AND IT'S BEEN A ROUGH COUPLE OF YEARS AROUND OUR HOME MY TWO YEAR OLD DAUGHTER ABBY HAS SPINA BIFIDA AND RECEIVED EARLY START SERVICES FROM THE REGIONAL CENTER BECAUSE OF THE PATHOGENIC OLIVER SERVICES HOW TO BE PROVIDED FOR ME IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO PROVIDE THERAPY TO THE BABY OVER SALE AND THIS IS ON TOP OF JUGGLING MY OTHER TWO CHILDRN. WHO ARE NOT IN SCHOOL AND HAD TO BE SUPPORTED IN VIRTUAL LEARNING. BOTH MY HUSBAND I WORK FULL TIME AND HAD LITTLE SUPPORT AT THE TIME. I WAS WORKING FROM FOR A NONPROFIT THAT PROVIDED A COMMUNITY BASED DAY PROGRAM TO ADULTS WITH DISABILITIES THAT ALSO HAD AGO VIRTUAL. THAT'S BECAUSE THE HUGE AMOUNT OF STRESS ON OUR FAMILY. BUT I'M NOT ALONE AND I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH THE VIEW HAS FOUND FROM OUR COMMUNITY ABOUT THE OBSTACLE SPACE AND SUPPORTS THE RECEIVED DURING THE PANDEMIC. WE WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT HURT HER I THINK EFFORTS OF SO MANY IN OUR SYSTEM WELL TAKING LESSONS LEARNED AND MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTS. FIRST I WANT TO THINK GOVERNOR NEWSOM SECRETARY KHALIDI AND DIRECTOR NANCY PARCHMAN FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP IN ENSURING THAT PEOPLE WITH ADD WERE PRIORITIZED. FOR EARLY ACCESS TO VACCINES AND FOR REQUIRING VACCINES AND BOOSTERS FOR THE STAFF TO SUPPORT THEM. WE HOPE THAT THESE PRIORITIES AND REQUIREMENTS WILL CONTINUE AS ADDITIONAL VACCINATIONS. TESTING AND OTHER NEEDS EMERGE TO RESPOND TO KOBE TO CHALLENGES. BUT WE ARE CONCERNED THAT MANY SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE UNABLE TO SUPPORT CONTRACT WORKERS TO COMPLY WITH THESE MANDATES WHICH MUST BE ADDRESSED TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITIES. THE STATE COUNCIL AND MANY SERVICE PROVIDERS TO MEET PPL AVAILABLE IN THE PAST YEAR. DO YOU ALONG WITH MANY REGIONAL CENTERS AND PROVIDERS ALSO RAN VACCINE CLINICS AND EXTRA SUPPORT FOR PEOPLE WITH IDT. HOWEVER DURING THE MOST AWAY FROM. THEM DURING THE RECENT WAVE OF THAT- MACRON BEARING AND WE KNOW THAT IN MANY FAMILIES SOME ARE ALL FAMILY MEMBERS CONTRACTED COBIT. BURDEN OF SECURING SCORES TEST APPOINTMENTS IN TRAVELING TO THEM BITING COLD CAST MANAGING EFFECTIVE HOME ISOLATION. AND UNDERSTANDABLE GUIDELINES FOR ENDING PORTANTINO PUT AN ENORMOUS STRAIN ON FAMILIES. MANY DID NOT GET THE HELP THEY NEEDED WE WILL ADDRESS THE DEPARTMENT DEVELOPING MORE ROBUST SYSTEM FOR REGIONAL CENTERS TO ASSIST FAMILIES DURING PERIODS OF CRISIS. IN MAJOR REVELATION IN THE PAST TWO YEARS HAS BEEN THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF FLEXIBILITY ENACT ACCESSING RECEIVING SUPPORTS AND SERVICES. WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THE FLEXIBILITY DDS HAS PROVIDED THROUGH ITS DIRECTIVES TO REGIONAL CENTERS AND WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT THE DEPARTMENT. MAKE THOSE FLEXIBLE APPROACHES PERMANENT. YOU NOW IT'S WE TO YEARS OF LIFE UNDER THE COUNTER EXPERIENCE THE STRESS OF DISRUPTED WORK AND SCHOOLS GET SCHOOL SCHEDULES AND STILL NEED TO ATTEND CRITICAL MEETINGS REMOTELY AND TO ACCESS ADDITIONAL IN HOME RESPITE HOURS. WE WERE PLEASED TO SEE THAT LAST YEAR'S TRAILER BILL INCLUDED AMENDMENTS THAT ALLOW EARLY START L. ENTRANT ACTED MEETINGS ON SERVICES AND SUPPORTS TO BE HELD REMOTELY. WHEN REQUESTED BY CONSUMER AND WORK FAMILY. HOWEVER THIS FLEXIBILITY ONLY EXTENDS UNTIL JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND WE'RE EXPECTING. HE GAVE ME A PERMANENT WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT DDS CLEARLY ESTABLISHED AND MAKE PERMANENT THE CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF ADDITIONAL RESPITE HOURS WHEN NEEDED. WE HAVE ALSO HEARD MANY FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE DELIVERY OF ALTERNATIVE SERVICES. WE HAVE HEARD STORIES OF SERVICES BEING PROVIDED ONLY ONE ALREADY DAY ONLINE WHEN A PERSON HAS IN CRISIS AND NEEDS MUCH MORE. FOR SOME HAVING NO ACCESS TO A COMPUTER OR THE INTERNET MEANT THAT YOU RECEIVE NO SERVICES AT ALL THESE ISSUES. THE AFFECTED PEOPLE IN CONGREGATE PROGRAMS WHICH HAD TO SHUT DOWN OVERNIGHT WITH LITTLE BIT NINETEEN STRUCK. THE LESSON LEARNED HERE IS THAT OUR SYSTEM RELIES TOO HEAVILY ON CONGREGATE PROGRAMS AND WE MUST MOVE TOWARD MORE INDIVIDUALIZED INTEGRATED SETTINGS ESPECIALLY SINCE THEY MUST CHANGE BY NEXT YEAR'S MIGHT BY NEXT YEAR'S. EACH CBS FINAL RULE DEADLINE IN ADDITION WE WANT TO COMMEND THE HEROES IN OUR COMMUNITY WHO SHOWED UP IN PERSON EVERY DAY DURING THE PANDEMIC. THE SUPPORTED LIVING RESPITE AND KRISTIN ALL SYSTEM PROVIDERS CAME TO THE HOME OF PEOPLE WITH IDT EVEN WHEN I COOK IT. WORKED OVERTIME TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE WERE SUPPORTED BUT THESE HEROES WHATEVER REWARDED. FOR THEIR LIFE SAVING WORK WELL THE LEGISLATURE AUTHORIZE FUNDING FOR CARICOM THE PAYMENT OF FIVE HUNDRED FOR HSS WORKERS. THAT SEEMED BONUS WAS NOT FUNDED FOR DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS TO DO THE SAME. WORK AND OFTEN IN THE SAME HOME. THANKS AND- IN THE PAST TWO YEARS WILL LIKELY TO A TOLL ON TO MEET. EVEN THOUGH WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WE MUST ALSO PLAN FOR TERM. OF KOBE DON'T OUR COMMUNITY INCLUDING RICK. MENTAL HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL STE. WE IS FOR THE- WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE NTDS TO MEET THESE CHALLENGES AND IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR ALL PEOPLE AND FAMILIES SERVED. THANK YOU.

AND I CAN JUST TELL YOU WE ARE DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF ON AND DISABILITY EQUITY PLAN OF ACTION AND WORK WORK WITH THE STATE GOVERNMENT AS WELL THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. SO JUST SOME QUICK POINTS AND TERMS OF LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE PANDEMIC FIRST I JUST WANT TO ECHO- BUT- IS HEROES THAT- ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FLEXIBILITY THAT DDS GAVE THE REGIONAL CENTERS QUICKLY AT THE BEGINNING OF A PANDEMIC. THAT WAS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT DDS TO FAST AND IT MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE SO I JUST WANT TO LOOK THAT UP AND I AGREE THAT THAT THAT KIND OF FLEXIBILITY AND RAPID RESPONSE FROM DDS IS SOMETHING THAT- SHOULD BE SIMILAR TO TRY TO DO IN RESPONSE TO ANY EMERGENCY NOT JUST IN THE PANDEMIC AND SOME OF IT. SHOULD BE BAKED INTO THEIR REGULAR POLICIES SO I REALLY APPRECIATED. HER COMMENT ON THAT CENTERS. WE DID NOT SEE CONCERT REGIONAL WE'RE BETTER AT THE- OF TIME MOLD WAYS OF COMMUNICATING INFORMATION THAT THEY NEEDED IN ORDER TO STAY SAFE. AND TO HAVE SERVICES DURING THE PANDEMIC I'VE ALWAYS LOOKED UP TO AS A POSITIVE EXAMPLE. THE VALLEY MOUNTAIN REGIONAL CENTER WHICH DIDN'T JUST RELY ON EMAIL UPDATES AS AS MOST OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS DEAD. BUT THEY ALSO HAD IN PERSON OUTREACH SESSIONS AND THEY HAD MULTIPLE WAYS OF REACHING OUT TO MAKE SURE. PEOPLE HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEEDED TO STAY SAFE. DURING THE PANDEMIC ANOTHER EXAMPLE WHERE THERE'S BEEN INCONSISTENCY HAS SOME REGIONAL CENTERS. HAVE A DATE AND SAID WE'RE NOT GOING TO KEEP PAYING FOR SOME OF THESE PANDEMIC RELATED SERVICES AFTER. YOU KNOW APRIL FIRST OR AFTER JANUARY FIRST. NOT WITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT THE PANDEMIC IS STILL ON GOING AND NONE OF US KNOW WHEN IT'S GONNA AND SO. WE'D LIKE TO SEE MORE CONSISTENT OVERSIGHT FROM DDS TELLING THE REGIONAL CENTERS FLEXIBILITY IS REALLY IMPORTANT NOW JUST LIKE IT WAS IMPORTANT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMICS AND YOU SHOULD NOT SET ARBITRARY DATES AROUND WHICH CERTAIN SERVICES ARE GONNA AND- I ALSO JUST WANTED TO LIFT UP. THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THERE WERE MANY POINTS DURING THE PANDEMIC. WHERE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH MADE DECISIONS THAT TURNED OUT NOT TO BE GREAT DECISIONS IN PART BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T TALKING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES AND OTHER FOLKS TO KIND OF HELP THEM AVOID. THOSE DECISIONS MORE EXAMPLE WAS THE CRISIS STANDARDS OF CARE GUIDELINES WHEN THEY CAME OUT WITH DRAFT GUIDELINES EARLY IN THE PANDEMIC. THE BASICALLY SAID IT WAS OKAY TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE OLDER PEOPLE WHEN YOU'RE DECIDING WHO'S GOING TO GET A VENTILATOR OR OTHER- SCARE. SERVICE IN A IN A- AND HEALTH CARE RATIONING SUCH A- WE ABLE TO PUSH. AND THEY'D SAY THEIR- AND I GREW THAT TIME CAL. HAS TURNED OUT TO BE A GREAT LISTENER AND A ALLY TO THE- COMMUNITIES BUT IT WAS A TRUCK THAT. WAS NOT. ABLE TO THERE WAS TO BEAR FOR THOSE TRAPPED GUIDELINES FOR RELIEF. ANOTHER EXAMPLE WAS ON BACK PRIVATIZATION AGAIN THEY ENDED UP IN A GOOD PLACE. BUT WE HAD TO HAVE A FIGHT TO GET THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO PRIORITIZE. UNDER SIXTY FIVE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WHO ARE HIGH RISK INCLUDING EVERYBODY WHO'S THE REGIONAL CENTER CONSUMER THAT'S WHERE THEY ENDED UP. BUT IT WAS A THERE WAS A LOT OF BACK. AND FORTH BEFORE WE GOT TO THAT POINT. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS A HOSPITAL VISITATIONS WE HAD TO PUSH HARD. TO GET THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO MAKE CLEAR. THAT PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES OR HAD TO GO TO A HOSPITAL SHOULD BE ABLE TO BRING. A SAFE PERSON WITH THEM SOME INFO CONTRA WITH EVEN THOUGH THERE'S A POLICY AGAINST LETTING PEOPLE BRING VISITORS TO HOSPITAL WE SAW THAT AS AN ACCOMMODATION. UNDER THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT BUT AGAIN THAT WAS A FIGHT THAT WE SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO HAVE. I ALSO JUST WANT TO LET DOWN. THIS PARADIGM HAS DESTROYED A LOT OF SERVICE MODELS YOU HAD A WHOLE ISSUE SESSION FOR YOU TALKED ABOUT SOME MINIMUM WAGE EMPLOYMENT AND SEGREGATED EMPLOYMENT. AND I JUST ENCOURAGE US AS WE REBUILD FROM THE PANDEMIC. TO ASK THE QUESTION WHEN WE LOOK AT A SERVICE MODEL. WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ADVANCE INTEGRATION WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ADVANCE SELF DETERMINATION AND WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO ADVANCE EQUITY. AND IF THE SERVICE MODEL IS NOT REALLY ADVANCING THOSE CALLS THE MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T BE BUILT ABOUT WE SHOULD HELP THEM INNOVATE. TO CREATE A NEW SERVICE MODEL THAT WOULD ENHANCE THOSE CAUGHT. THE LAST PANEL UNDER. I JUST ONE THING I WANT TO LIFT UP TO THE THINK IT'S EASIER GET LOST IN DATA. IF WE'RE SPENDING TWO AND A HALF TO THREE TIMES AS MUCH ON WHITE INDIVIDUALS AS WE ARE ON A LOT NEXT INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS TO EXPLAIN IT BUT WANT TO EXPLAIN IT IS DISCRIMINATION I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE NOT LEVEL OF DISPARITY. IF PEOPLE WHO ARE LATIN ACTS OR AFRICAN AMERICAN OR IN OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT ARE EXPERIENCING DISPARITIES. WARRANT ALSO EXPERIENCING DISCRIMINATION SO AS WE THINK ABOUT A RESPONSE TO DISPARITIES ARE ENCOURAGED TO TALK ABOUT CIVIL RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT WHAT ARE WE DOING. TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT EXPERIENCING RACIAL DISCRIMINATION WHEN THEY GO TO SERVICES FROM A REGIONAL CENTER. AND FINALLY IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN EQUITY AGENDA FOR CALIFORNIA WE NEED BETTER DATA. ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE WEREN'T ABLE TO GET VACCINES EARLIER FOR PEOPLE DEVELOPMENT IS PLACES WE DIDN'T HAVE GOOD DATA. ON HOW THE DISEASE WAS AFFECTING PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES SO AS AS WE COME OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC LIKE LET'S MAKE A COMMITMENT THEY WERE GONNA COLLECT MORE DATA SO THAT WE'RE BETTER PREPARED FOR THE NEXT PANDEMIC. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR FINAL PANELIST ON THIS PANEL IS SMITTY GATES WOULD BE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. OF KERN REGIONAL CENTER. THE DIRECTOR GATE. YOU HEAR ME WE CAN HEAR YOU NOW. OKAY SORRY I THINK I FORGOT TO- YOU- THANK YOU COMMITTEE CHAIRED COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MEET SHE GAVE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR KERN REGIONAL CENTER. DURING THE PAST YEARS OF THE PANDEMIC REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE BEEN GUIDED AND SUPPORTED BY THE STRONG LEADERSHIP OF EDS. THE NUMBER OF DIRECTIVES HELD AT TIMES BEEN HARD TO KEEP UP WITH THAT HAS ENSURED A CONSISTENT RAPID RESPONSE. THESE DIRECTIVES AND ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND FUNDING TO ADDRESS PANDEMIC RELATED NEEDS. ALLOW CURRENT REGIONAL CENTER TO BETTER SERVE OUR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES ALL AT THE SAME TIME MAXIMIZING SAFETY. FOR EXAMPLE MAKING FACE TO FACE CONTACT WITH OUR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES THIS IMPORTANT. DIRECTIVES PROVIDING THE FLEXIBILITY TO CONNECT CONDUCT MEETINGS REMOTELY HELPED ENSURE THAT EVERYONE COULD STAY SAFE WHILE MAINTAINING ACCESS TO SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. WE ALSO FOUND THAT SOME INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES PREFERRED REMOTE VISITS AND IN THOSE CASES HAS RESULTED IN INCREASED PARTICIPATION IN MEETINGS. DIRECTIVES THAT SUPPORTED OUR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES SUCH AS THE ADDITION OF PERSONAL ASSISTANCE INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES AND SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT CHU PARTICIPANT DIRECTED SERVICES ALLOW INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES TO HAVE MORE CHOICE OVER HOW SERVICES FOR PROVIDED. AND PERHAPS MOST CRITICALLY FLIGHT HOME AND THE PANDEMIC ENVIRONMENT. PROVISION OF P. P. TO REGIONAL CENTERS FOR DISTRIBUTION TO INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES AND PROVIDERS HAS BEEN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN HELPING TO CONTAIN THE SPREAD OF INFECTION. KERN REGIONAL CENTER CONTINUES TO DISTRIBUTE DBS PROVIDED KEEP YOU SUPPLIES YOUR PROVIDERS INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WHEN NO OTHER RESOURCES AVAILABLE. KERN REGIONAL CENTERS ALSO SUPPORTED OUR FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER WITH PP DRIVES WHICH PARTICULARLY TARGET ARE HISPANIC LATINO COMMUNITY. ALLOWING REGIONAL CENTERS TO SUSPEND THE ANNUAL FAMILY PROGRAM BE AND FAMILY COST PARTICIPATION PROGRAM YEP YEAH N. F. C. P. P. OR FAMILIES IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT TANDEM X. SUPPORT. RK STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA DISABILITY VOICES UNITED INTEGRATED COMMUNITY COLLABORATIVE AND OTHER ADVOCACY GROUPS SUPPORT ELIMINATING THOSE TWO PROGRAMS PERMANENTLY. KERN REGIONAL CENTER HOUSES BUDGET COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER THIS ACTION THESE FEES WERE INSTITUTED DURING THE RECEPTION RECESSION BUT ARE NOT PROVIDING HOPE FOR COST SAVINGS TO THE STATE. THEY ARE INSTEAD BARRIERS TO FAMILIES UTILIZING REGIONAL CENTER SERVICES. IN TERMS OF CHALLENGES THE PANDEMIC HAS BEEN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR VENDORS THE PEOPLE WHO DIRECTLY SUPPORT OUR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES DUE TO THE NEED TO VIGILANTLY GUARD AGAINST CROSS INFECTION A DOCTOR HUGE CHANGES IN THE WAY SERVICES ARE PROVIDED AN ADDRESS I'M GOING STAFFING SHORTAGES AND INCREASED OVER TIME NEEDS. DTS RECORDS ALLOWING REGIONAL CENTER EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS TO APPROVE PANDEMIC RELATED HIGHER HEALTH AND SAFETY PAYMENT RATES TO KEEP STOP WORKING AND COMPENSATE THEM FOR LONGER WORK HOURS SHE ALLOWED KERN REGIONAL CENTER TO BE RESPONSIVE TO URGENT NEEDS. SOME DIRECTORS HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT DO YOU TO REGIONAL CENTER WORK LOAD CAPACITY. FOR EXAMPLE DOCUMENTING ALL COMBAT NINETEEN THE FACT INFECTIONS OCCURRING AMONG OUR INDIVIDUALS AND PROVIDERS. AND SERVICE COORDINATORS REGULARLY CONTACTING ALL INDIVIDUALS ON THEIR CASELOADS TO INSURE THE UNNECESSARILY SUPPORTS INFORMATION AND ACCESS TO VARIOUS COMMUNITY RESOURCES INCLUDING HOGAN NINETEEN TESTING AND VACCINES. EARLY IN THE CATATONIC CARE C. DIRECTED OUR SERVICE COORDINATORS TO MAKE MONTHLY CALLS TO ALL INDIVIDUALS ON THEIR CASELOAD. TO CHECK ON THEIR WELFARE ENQUIRE ABOUT THEIR NEEDS AND TO OFFER RESOURCES. THE CHALLENGE HAS BEEN HOW TO MAKE TIME FOR THIS IN AN ALREADY FULL DAY. OUR SYSTEM THAT'S GUIDED BY THE IMPERATIVE TO PUT THE HEALTH SAFETY AND NEEDS OF OUR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES FIRST ABOVE ALL OTHER INTERESTS. OVER THE YEARS INCREASE COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS AND HIGH CASELOADS HAVE MADE IT CHALLENGING FOR REGIONAL CENTERS TO DO OUR JOBS CURRENT AND FUTURE INITIATIVES THAT REDUCE CASELOAD SIZES ENHANCED TECHNOLOGY. FOCUSED ON PERSON CENTERED SERVICES AND SUPPORTS AND MEASURE QUALITY THROUGHOUT COMES MEANINGFUL TO THE INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WE SERVE. THANK YOU COMMITTEE CHAIRED A OMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY. THE DIRECTOR DATES AND- I WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW UP- AFTER THIS MEETING ABOUT THE FAMILY PARTICIPATION FEES THAT YOU WERE SPEAKING ABOUT- AND- WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO SEE IF THIS IS CONSISTENT. WITH INCREASING ACCESS AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT. THIS WILL LEAD TOWARDS PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS AND REALLY APPRECIATE DIRECTOR GATES FOR YOU BRING IT TO OUR ATTENTION TO THAT. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE SEVEN OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE EIGHT IMPLEMENTATION REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT OF THE HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES H. C. B. S. FINAL RULE COMPLIANCE. WE WILL HAVE FOUR PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL BEGINNING WITH BRIAN WINFIELD CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR CDSS JIM KNIGHT DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR DDS US CHRISTOPHER O'NEILL WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND SONYA PADDOCK WITH L. A. L. LET US BEGIN WITH MR WINFIELD. HI MISTER CHAIR AT THE GYM NINETY WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND I WILL- BRIGHTON RESPOND TO THE QUESTIONS IN THE AGENDA ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT. SO AS NOTED IN THE AGENDA IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS. WE ANTICIPATE SUBMITTING OUR STATE WIDE TRANSITION PLAN TO THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES. FOR THEIR FINAL APPROVAL LATER THIS YEAR AND SO JUST TAKING A STEP BACK THIS PLAN IS A REQUIREMENT THAT THAT JUST OUTLINED IS A FANTASTIC THEY PLAN. OF WHAT WE ARE WE ARE AT THE IN IN MEETING THESE REQUIREMENTS AND WHAT OUR PLAN IS FOR WORK TAINING- COMPLIANCE. THAT BY MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. SO A COUPLE OF THE THAT ARE HIGHLY THAT ARE WE- TO BE THIS PLANT UP WE NEED TO GET THE FINAL APPROVAL ACTUALLY BEFORE I GO THERE. JUST FOR COMPARISON. YEAH THERE ARE TWO STEPS TO THE APPROVAL PROCESS AND ON. THE TRANSITION PLANS. THERE'S AN INITIAL APPROVAL WHICH THAT THE STATES THAT WE HAVE ALREADY OBTAINED OF THE STATE. AND THEN FINAL APPROVAL WHICH IS WHAT WE'LL BE LOOKING TO JUST AMERICAN THAN A CHANGE LATER THIS YEAR. JUST SO YOU JUST FOR AWARENESS. THERE ARE TWENTY ONE STATES THAT HAVE RECEIVED FINAL APPROVAL FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON THEIR PLANS. WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE INITIAL APPROVAL AND THERE ARE STILL FOUR STATES THAT ARE STILL WORKING TOWARDS EVEN A TEAM IN THE INITIAL APPROVAL AS WELL. SO THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A WIDE VARIATION THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY OF. OF THE STATUS OF WHERE STATES ARE. BOB OKAY OF THE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE INCLUDED IN THE- THE IN THIS PLANT TO GET FINAL APROVAL AS ONE THEY SET AN ESTIMATE OF WHERE WE ARE AS FAR AS MEETING THESE REQUIREMENTS INTO THAT'S GOING TO INCLUDING THAT OF THE NUMBER OF PROVIDERS THAT CURRENTLY MEET THE REQUIREMENTS AND THOSE THAT DON'T AND THEN ALSO A PLAN OF HOW THEN WHAT WHAT IT'S- PROCESS TRANSFER BURKE DOES PROVIDERS TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE. AGAIN BY MARCH TWENTY TWENTY THREE. SO IT'S A MULTI STEP ASSESSMENT PROCESS THAT WE NEED TO DO TO. GET THOSE ESTIMATES OF THOSE NUMBERS ABOUT WHAT WHERE WE ARE SH AND SO IT BEGAN WITH THE PROVIDERS COMPLETING A SELF ASSESSMENT- TO IT TOO DEAR. GERMANY BASED ON THE BACK PROVIDERS- VIEW HOWEVER THEY MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS IN THAT BOOK WHATEVER. PURCHASE A STRANGE REQUIREMENTS. THE NEXT STEP THAT WE TO GO. IS THE VALIDATION OF THOSE RESULTS AGAINST THE PROVIDERS THAT DENNIS THAT'S MATCH BUT THEN THERE HAS TO BE A FOLLOW UP- OR WHAT WE REFER TO AS VALIDATION OF THOSE RESULTS. PROCESS VALIDATION- FOLLOW UP PROCESS IS UNDER WAY AND IT'S GOING SH IT'S TAKING PART IN A COUPLE OF WAY. ONE ALREADY BEEN DONE FOR A SAMPLE OF PROVIDERS- THROUGH ONSITE. VISITS OR ASSESSMENTS. AND THEN FURTHER TO THE OTHERS WE ARE WORKING THROUGH A PROCESS THAT WILL BE- SUBMISSION OF DOCUMENTATIONS THAT CAN BE REVIEWED BY THE STATE REGIONAL CENTER. AND OTHERS TO VERIFY THE RESULTS OF THE MEET THE ASSESSMENT THAT THE PROVIDERS OF DOT. ALSO ASKED ABOUT WHAT WILL OCCUR- IF CALIFORNIADOESN'T NEED COMPLIANCE AND SO. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE WAY SAID THAT- THAT OF THE STATE WIDE TRANSITION PLAN NOT ONLY HAVE TO INCLUDE A TESTAMENT TO COMPLIANCE. BUT ALSO HAVE TO OUTLINED WHAT IS THE ONGOING MONITORING PROCESS. TO ENSURE ORCHARDS AT. THE POPE THE STATE CAN BE A AND THAT ULTIMATE. THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES CAN BE AWARE OF HOW THE STATE IS DOING IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE SETTINGS REQUIRE. SO WE'RE GONNA DISSIPATE THAT REPORTING ON AN ONGOING BASIS ON OUR- COMPLIANCE AND HOW THE STATE IS DOING IS GOING TO BE PART OF THAT ONGOING ROUTINE REPORTING THAT WE ALREADY DO. AND THAT INCLUDES- MAJORS RIGHT NOW IN OTHER AREAS NOT RELATED TO SENATE REQUIREMENTS BUT- ABOUT INDIVIDUALS HEALTH AND WELFARE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND OTHERS. ONCE AGAIN THAT'S A SO THIS IS ANOTHER REQUIREMENT THAT WE ARE EXPECTING TO. HAVE TO CONTINUE TO REPORT ON TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND YOU KNOW ALREADY YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT THE STATUS OF- THE FEDERAL COMPLIANCE NOW YOU KNOW THAT'S GOING TO BE AFFECTED SAID WITH THE OTHER FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS IS GONNA BE MONITORED ON A CONTINUING BASIS WE'RE TALKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT- THE DEFENSE REQUIREMENTS THE RESULTS OF THE PROVIDER SELF ASSESSMENT- ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE. AS WE CONTINUE THE VALIDATION OR FOLLOW UP ACTIVITIES THAT I TALKED ABOUT WILL UPDATE THAT INFORMATION WHICH GIVES AN OUTLINE OF WHERE WE ARE THE NUMBER OF PROVIDERS THAT ARE. IN COMPLIANCE AND THOSE THAT ARE NOT. AND WILL CONTINUE TO UPDATE INFORMATION THE STATISTICS THAT ARE AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE REGULARLY AS REQUIRED BY CURRENT STATUTE. BUT THERE'S A FINAL QUESTION ABOUT HOW TO THE WORK ON THE SETTINGS REQUIREMENTS INTERACT WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RATE MODELS THANK HERE IT'S REALLY- HELPFUL TO NOTE THAT WHAT IS REQUIRE WHAT IS WHAT ARE THE SETTINGS REQUIREMENTS OF ABOUT IN AT A HIGH LEVEL YOU KNOW THAT THE CORE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS THE FOCUS ON CHOICE. AND THE QUALITY OF INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCE THAT SO IN SHORT IT'S ABOUT ESTABLISHING THE COURT IN A PERSON CENTRED WAY. THAT LEAD TO POSITIVE OUTCOMES. YES WE ARE A LOT OF TALK TODAY ABOUT NOT ONLY ARE QUALITY INCENTIVE PROGRAMS BUT THERE'S ALSO BEEN REFERENCE YOU THE DIRECT SERVICE PROFESSIONAL TRAINING. PROGRAM ALL THE LOOKING AT LOSING ABOUT CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY COMPETENT SERVICES AND AN INDIVIDUAL CAN PROVIDE DOLLARS LOCAL BILINGUAL TYPE AND THAT WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING GENTLEMEN AS WELL. ALL THOSE MAYOR TO GAS WITH WELL I THE RATE MODEL REALLY GOING TO SUPPORT- IN THE WAKE REFORM THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THIS YEAR TO REALLY LEAD TO THAT PERSON THAT ARE POSITIVE OUTCOME BASED THAT. INFO ALONG WITH THE QUALITY INCENTIVES THAT WORK IN PERFORMANCE AND THAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER SCHNALL WHAT WHAT CAN IN HAND NOT JUST THE RIGHT MODEL FOR ALL OF THESE INVESTMENT. THAT REALLY GO TOWARDS- BUILDING AND SUPPORTING THEM LAYING THE GROUNDWORK SO THAT WE CAN MEET- OVERALL THAT. THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. THANK YOU THINK WE ARE COVERED THE INFORMATION QUESTIONS ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT AND CERTAINLY HAPPY TO RESPOND TO QUESTIONS LATER. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- CHRISTOPHER O'NEILL WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- NOTHING TO NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD TO THE PRESENTATION. NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM SUNNY PADDOCK WITH THE L. L.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I APPRECIATED THE DEPARTMENT'S ANSWERS AND WE'LL BE FOLLOWING UP WIT MORE DETAILS AND WITH THAT WE WILL BE COMPLETING PANEL% NUMBER ISSUE EIGHT AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER NINE OUR LAST DISCUSSION OF THE DAY WHERE WE WILL HAVE EIGHT PRISONERS ON THIS PANEL DISCUSSING. THE IMPLEMENTATION REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT OF VARIOUS TWENTY TWENTY ONE INITIATIVES AND THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM WILL BEGIN WITH DIRECTOR BARGE MAN FOLLOWED BY BRIAN WINFIELD KARLA CASTANEDA CHRISTOPHER ODD MEAL WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SONYA PADDOCK WITH THE L. A. O. TIM CHEN WHO'S THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR FOR DISABILITY VOICES UNITED BABY ON HAN SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA AN AMY WEST WING EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF ARCA. LET US PLEASE BEGIN WITH DIRECTOR PARCHMENT ALL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- THE NUMBER OF INITIATIVES THE ONE THAT I'M IN A- PROVIDE A QUICK UPDATE ON IS- RELATED TO ITEM C. AND THE AGENDA ON PAGE THIRTY SEVEN AND THAT'S THE- LANGUAGE ACCESS AND CALL CULTURAL COMPETENCY- WE ARE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO USING THE FUNDS THAT WERE EARMARKED FOR THE DEPARTMENT- FOR THE COMMUNITY. IN LANGUAGE ACCESS AND CULTURAL COMPETENCY- ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND- THE INITIAL GUIDELINES FOR REGIONAL CENTERS SHOULD BE OUT BY- APRIL FIRST WE'VE BEEN MEETING WITH STAKEHOLDERS GETTING SOME. INFORMATION AS TO PRIORITIES ON THIS INITIAL INVESTMENT WHY WE WORK ON THIS NEXT YEAR ON WHAT ARE THE PRIORITIES- I'M GOING FORWARD AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE REALLY EXPANDING BE COMPETENCY AND CULTURAL RESPONSIVENESS OF OUR REGIONAL CENTERS AND YOU SEEN. THE INVESTMENT IN IN THE FUNDS TO I'M EFFECT CHANGE- SOME FEEDBACK THAT WE'VE ALREADY RECEIVED FROM OUR COMMUNITY. THANK GOODNESS REALLY TAKE A LOOK AT OUR THE INTAKE PACKET OR THE INFORMATION THAT IS PROVIDED TO- FAMILIES CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE NOT ONLY TO OUR THAT NEXT COMMUNITY BUT OUR AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY. AND AN API SO WE'RE REALLY GOING TO BE TAKING A LOOK AT YOU KNOW ARE THERE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO STATEWIDE AS WELL AS REGIONAL CENTER SPECIFIC CAN BE RESPONSIVE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. I'M ALSO LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN TAILOR- ASSESSMENT SPECIFICALLY FOR THE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES- BUT LOOKING AT EACH REGIONAL CENTERS TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT- THEY- SERVIN WHERE THEY'RE PROVIDING- THE SUPPORT. OF WE'RE APPROACHING THIS- INITIALLY AS HAVING BASE FUNDING THAT WOULD BE ALLOCATED TO REGIONAL CENTERS AND I'M REALLY LOOKING AT THOSE REGIONAL CENTERS THAT HAVE A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF- FAMILIES THAT ARE MONOLINGUAL- AND ALSO LOOKING AS TO A ALLOCATION AND THAT WOULD BE GREATER FOR THOSE WHO HAVE GREATER DIVERSITY IN OUR COMMUNITY. THAT WE ALREADY KNOW HAVE- ACT ACCESS ISSUES BASED ON CULTURE OR LANGUAGE UNTIL WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS AND PROVIDING ADDITIONAL UPDATES OF SWEET FURTHER- THE DISCUSSIONS AND- IDENTIFY OUTCOMES WITH THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE FUNDS- IN MY COLLEAGUE- THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR BRIAN WENT BILL'S GOING TO. ADDRESS THE NEXT SET OF QUESTIONS. YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE COFFEE ADDRESSING SELF DETERMINATION AND SOCIAL RECREATION AND CAN'T SERVICES AFTERNOON. WITH REGARDS TO THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM ONE OF THE QUESTIONS ASKED WAS HOW MANY OF THE PARTICIPANTS CHOICE SPECIALISTS HAVE BEEN RECRUITED AND HIRED BY REGIONAL CENTERS. AND AS OF TO DATE A REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE HIRED TWENTY SIX OF THOSE- STAFF. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF REGIONAL CENTERS THAT HAVE- FILLS ALL THREE OF THEIR POSITIONS AND THEN OTHER REGIONAL CENTRES- EITHER ONE OR TWO. OR ARE IN ACTIVE RECRUITMENT AND EXPECT TO HAVE THOSE POSITIONS FILLED- I OFTENTIMES IN FEBRUARY OR EVEN MARCH. THE HOME THESE PARTISAN CHOI SPECIAL. WILL BE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS AND REGIONAL CENTER SERVICE OPTIONS THAT% INCREASED CONSUMER CHOICE AND CONTROL AND PARTICIPANT DIRECTED SERVICES AND THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM- THEY WILL NOT CARRY CASELOADS. THEREFORE THEY'LL BE FULLY DEDICATED TO SUPPORTING THE REGIONAL CENTER SERVICE COORDINATORS AS THEY ARE ASSISTING CONSUMERS AND FAMILIES WITH TIMELY TRANSITIONS TO THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM. AND BUILDING THE REGIONAL CENTER IN TUESDAY INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE REGARDING PARTICIPANT DIRECTED SERVICE OPTIONS WHICH INCLUDE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM. FROM WHAT THE QUESTIONS ASKED HAS TO DO WITH THE GOALS AROUND EQUITY BEING INCORPORATED INTO ENROLLMENT DIRECTORS WITH REGIONAL CENTERS- IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY ONE THE DEPARTMENT ISSUED A DIRECTIVE TO REGIONAL CENTRES WITH REGARDS TO. THE DUTIES OF THE PARTICIPANT DIRECTED SERVICES A SPECIALIST AND REQUIRED THE REGIONAL CENTER TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A CAP REGION TRAINING PLAN ABOUT THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAMS FOR THEIR DIVERSE COMMUNITIES SERVED% BY REGIONAL CENTER- INCLUDING IN CONGREGATE SETTINGS. AND ALREADY HE HAS PART OF A TWENTY ONE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. IN THESE PLANS THE INFORMATION. IT SAYS THE INFORMATION WILL BE IN PLAIN LANGUAGE ALTERNATE FORMATS AND OUTRIGGERS MODES OF COMMUNICATION AND IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES AND THAT THE REGIONAL SENSIBILITY INPUT FROM STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING CONSUMERS AND FAMILIES THAT REFLECT THE ETHNIC AND LANGUAGE DIVERSITY OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS CONSUMERS ABOUT THE- EFFECTIVENESS OF THE OUTREACH AND TRAINING AND OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING DISPARITIES IN THESE PROGRAMS. ON THE PARTICIPANT'S CHOICE SPECIALIST WILL EXPAND THE AWARENESS OF PARTICIPANT DIRECTED SERVICE OPTIONS THROUGH THESE EFFORTS AND IDENTIFY CONCERNS AND BARRIERS TO ENROLLMENT- REDUCE. SHARES AND BUY FROM AFTER TRAIN TO CONSUMER PARTISAN DIRECT DIRECTED OPTIONS TODAY ALL THE WORK FOR DEPARTMENT DOES HISTORY TO THE LENS OF SERVICE ACCESS AND EQUITY AND WITH REGARDS TO SELF DETERMINATION IT'S NO DIFFERENT- IT IS OUR GOAL TO ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAM IS AVAILABLE. TO ALL AND REFLECTS THE DIVERSITY OF CONSUMERS SERVED BY THE REGIONAL CENTER AND THAT DISPARITIES IN THE SIZE OF THE BUDGETS ARE REDUCED- WE ARE CLOSELY MONITORING THE S. THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM IN A PROMISE BY REGIONAL CENTER AND BY ETHNICITY AND WHERE NECESSARY I'M TAKING ACTION. WITH THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND OUR STAKEHOLDERS. TO HELP INCREASE EQUITY ACCESS DDS IS A WOMAN IN A NUMBER OF ITEMS- DOING NOT REACHING TRAINING TO THE COMMUNITIES AS WE TALKED BEFORE ABOUT THE ARTIST CONTRACTED SERVICES SPECIALIST BUT- I'M ALSO- THIS IS PART OF THAT THE DEPARTMENT'S MISSION AS WELL. WE WILL SOON BE ISSUING GUIDANCE TO REGIONAL CENTERS THAT- PERTAINS TO THE LOCAL VOLUNTEER ADVISORY COMMITTEE FUNDING. THAT PROVIDES A FOCUS ON USING THESE FUNDS TO INCREASE ACCESS FOR THE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES SERVED BY THE REGIONAL CENTER- OTHER WAYS THAT HOW WE'RE EXPANDING INTO SUPPORT FOR ENROLLMENT- DECIDES TO PURCHASE NAY CHOI SPECIALISTS. AND WE'RE ALSO DEVELOPING ENHANCED TRANSITION SUPPORTS WILL BE FOCUSED ON MORE INDIVIDUALLY TAILORED SUPPORT FOR INDIVIDUALS AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES HE SUPPORTS WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL FUNDING AND THE SUPPORT COMPONENTS WILL BE UNBUNDLED TO BEST MEET INDIVIDUAL NEEDS- WE'RE ALSO HAVE A STATEWIDE ORIENTATION CONTRACTS THROUGH THE STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. ALL TRAINING MATERIALS WILL BE IN PLAIN LANGUAGE PROVIDED IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH AND OTHER LANGUAGES HAS REQUESTED BY CONSUMERS AND FAMILIES. THE TRAINING WILL BE DELIVERED AND MODULES. FOR CONSUMERS AND FAMILY MEMBERS CAN ACCESS THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION THEY NEED. IN ADDITION TO LIVE TRAINING SESSIONS THE TRAINING WILL BE POSTED ON LIGHTS THAT CAN BE EASILY ACCESSIBLE- ALSO DEVELOPMENT OF ADDITIONAL TRANSITION SUPPORTS PROVIDED BY FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SERVICES PROVIDED DURING THE TWO MONTHS HE NEATLY PRIOR TO THE ENROLLMENT. WE'VE HEARD THAT THAT'S A VERY- TO INDIVIDUALS AND ROLLING INTO SELF DETERMINATION AS A WORKING ON A WAY IN WHICH OUR FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SERVICES CAN ASSIST INDIVIDUALS. PRIOR TO THAT THAT INITIAL. ENROLLMENT STP- SO HAS WE MOVE FORWARD WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE EQUITY IN ACCESS TO THE PROGRAM- BY DEVELOPING TARGETS AND BENCHMARKS WHICH WILL INCLUDE AREAS SUCH AS TIMELY ENROLLMENT. DIVERSITY OF CONSUMER SURVEY AND REDUCTION OF DISPARITIES IN THE PROGRAM. I WILL BE REVIEWING INDIVIDUAL BUDGETS EXCEEDING IDENTIFIED THRESHOLDS TO IDENTIFY TRENDS AND NEED FOR ADDITIONAL PROGRAM GUIDANCE. AND A REVIEW OF INFORMATION RECEIVED THROUGH THE PARTICIPATORY SPECIALIST AND THREE WITH THE ORIENTATIONS ARE CONDUCTED BY THE STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. OUR LAST QUESTION IS- HOW HAS TVS IN THE HOMELESS PERSON USED TO STATEWIDE SELF DETERMINATION ADVISORY COMMITTEE'S REPORTTO ON BARRIERS TO IMPROVE ACCESS. FIRST AS YOU'RE PROBABLY AWARE OF SELF DETERMINATION HAD A THREE YEAR PHASE AND WAS OPEN TO ALL REGIONAL CENTER CONSUMERS EFFECTIVE JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE- THE STATUTE WAS AMENDED TO REQUIRE REGIONAL CENTERS TO ME SELF DETERMINATION TARGETS AS WELL AS BENCHMARKS. AS I MENTIONED BEFORE ALL THOSE TARGETS AND BENCHMARKS- WILL BE DEVELOPED AND WITH THE I. OF INCREASING ACCESS TO ALL ETHNICITIES- WE'VE ENTERED INTO THE INTER AGENCY AGREEMENT WITH THE STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL SWEDISH FOR ORIENTATION AS I MENTIONED. AND THE CHARACTERISTICS. OF THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED- LOS- ISSUE FRANKLY I QUESTIONS AND IF DIRECT AND GUIDANCE TO REGIONAL CENTRES- SENSE THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE PASSED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO PROVIDE MORE STRUCTURE AND FRAMEWORK AROUND THE PROGRAM PROVIDE TRAINING TO ALL THE SERVICE COORDINATORS IMPAIR HEARING SPECIALIST. ON THE PRINCIPLES OF SELF DETERMINATION THE MECHANICS OF THE SELF PROCLAIMED TERMINATION PROGRAM AND THE RIGHTS OF CONSUMERS AND FAMILIES ARE THESE TRAINING WILL BE CONDUCTED IN COLLABORATION WITH THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND THE LOCAL VOLUNTEER ADVISORY COMMITTEES. LASTLY WE DID ESTABLISH AN OFFICE OF OMBUDSPERSON. FOR SELF DETERMINATION AND THAT PERSON WAS APPOINTED BY OUR DIRECTOR ON OCTOBER TWELFTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE- JEFF THE INFORMATION IS ON OUR WEBSITE AND WE- HOLD PUBLIC MEETINGS TO- PUBLICIZE THE AVAILABILITY OF THE OMBUDSPERSON. AND WE ARE ALSO- ESTABLISHING THE ENTIRE- OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN BUT THAT POSITION CURRENTLY EXISTS TO. RECEIVE INPUT FROM THE COMMUNITY TO PROVIDE ADVOCACY AND TO REDUCE BARRIERS TO ACCESS TO THE PROGRAM. NEXT I'LL TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT THE RESTORATION OF SOCIAL RACK RECREATION A CAPTAIN SERVICES- ONE OF THE QUESTIONS POSED WAS HOW CAN THE STATE CLARIFY USES SO THAT THE RESTORATION DOES NOT NECESSARILY RESULT INTO MANAGEMENT OTHER SERVICES LIKE RESPITE- THE DEPARTMENT HAS RECEIVED A FEW INCREASE FROM FAMILIES ABOUT SOCIAL RECREATION AT CAMP AND SO WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE CLARIFICATION TO THE FAMILY MEMBERS- ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE HAVE PROVIDED LEADERSHIP AND CLARIFICATION IS THROUGH OTHER REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF REGIONAL CENTER PURCHASE OF SERVICE POLICIES. THESE ARE POLICIES THAT ARE USED BY REGIONAL CENTER STAFF TO HELP GUIDE THEM ON THE PURCHASE OF SERVICES AND SO THE DEPARTMENT HAS A REALLY CRITICAL ROLE IN ENSURING THAT THOSE POLICIES COMPLY WITH UP STATUTES AND REGULATIONS IN AND COURT DECISIONS SO WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT ON ON GOING BASIS. BOB WE HAVE BEEN PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO REGIONAL CENTERS ON THE RESTORATION OF SOCIAL RECREATION CAMP. AT ALSO REQUIRED EACH OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS TO DEVELOP OUTREACH AND TRAINING PLAN WITH A FOCUS ON UNDERSTOOD UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR COMMUNITIES ARE. AWARE OF THE RESTORATION AND FAMILIAR WITH THE SERVICE OF THIS- ANOTHER QUESTION IS WHAT IS DÍAS% DOING OR WILL DO TO TRACK THE IMPACT ON DISPARITIES. AGAIN THE OUTREACH PLAN TO THE REGIONAL CENTERS BUT THE RESULTS HAD TO CREATE- REFLECTS THAT COMMITMENT TO OUR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES- WE ALSO HAVE CREATED A SOME CODE. THAT REGIONAL CENTERS CAN USE THAT THEY CAN IDENTIFY ALL SERVICES THAT ARE PURCHASED FOR SOCIAL RECREATION- SANDERS CAN PURCHASE SOCIAL RECREATION AND A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS AND IT ISN'T ALWAYS- OBVIOUS ON ITS FACE THAT THAT WAS THIRTY INTO A PURPOSE LESS SOCIAL RECREATION. SO THROUGH THE USE OF THE SUB CODE I WILL BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY I'M ALL OF THOSE. EXPENDITURES LAST QUESTION WHAT IS THE CURRENT YEAR LEVEL OF EXPENDITURE STATEWIDE SO FAR BY REGIONAL CENTER AND THE OUT REACH EFFORTS- WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING. THE DATA ON A MONTH BY MONTH BASIS IT'S A LITTLE EARLY I'M IN THE PROCESS TO SEE A HUGE INCREASE. REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN- BUILDING UP THEIR PROVIDER NETWORKS TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES- THEY HAVE BEEN USING A VARIETY OF FORMS FOR. MAKING THE COMMUNITY AWARE OF THEM THEY'VE BEEN DISCUSSING THE SERVICES AND THE CONTACT OF INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM PLAN MEETINGS. AND ALTHOUGH WE DO HAVE SOME PURCHASE A SERVICE DATA THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT- IF THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH YET TO MAKE A DETERMINATION ON ON THE USAGE YET. I'M LAST ARE CLOSE WITH SOME OF THE AVERAGE EFFORTS BY REGIONAL CENTERS WHICH ARE DEVELOPMENT OF TRAINING MATERIALS- SUCH AS NARRATED POWER POINTS IN FACT SHEETS. A PUBLIC MEETINGS WHICH INCLUDE TOWN HALLS A COMMUNITY INFORMATION SESSIONS IN VIRTUAL MEETINGS. A REGIONAL CENTER CULTURAL SPECIALIST PROVIDING OUTREACH ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THE SERVICES- USING THEIR WEBSITES AND SOCIAL MEDIA POSTINGS. ARE TRAINING FOR REGIONAL CENTER STAFF. INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM PLANNED MEETINGS HAVE A PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED. OF GENDER OUTREACH AND DINNER MEETINGS. AND DISCUSSIONS WITH COMMUNITY GROUPS SUCH AS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS FROM THE TORAH'S. TRAININGS FOR PEER MENTORS AND FOCUS KICK MEETINGS. AND LASTLY PROVIDING A RESOURCE LISTINGS ON THEIR WEBSITES INTO. THEIR COMMUNITIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE WILL HEAR FROM CAR CAST. THANK YOU FOR CALLING ASKING OTHER DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES AND I WILL ADDRESS OUT THE QUESTIONS IN A AND WILL. FARM REGARDING THAT THE GENERAL QUESTIONS RELATED TO INVESTMENTS BOB PAGE OF THIRTY NINE AND FORTY HAVE A LIST OF THE INVESTMENTS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET. FOR THE DEPARTMENT INFORMATIONAL CENTERS WERE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF RECRUITING AND HIRING TO FILL A NUMBER OF THOSE POSITIONS- SOME OF THE OTHER. M. INITIATIVES OR WRAP UP. DEVELOP BASED ON LAST INFORMATION- WORKING SEE SOME THE PROJECTS TO LATER IN STILL DEPENDING ON HOW ANDTHOSE RISKS CAN GET UP AND RUNNING BUT OUR IS DIRECTLY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BALL IS MAINTAINING SO- MALL THERE WILL BE ONGOING STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND THAT THE STOCK DISCUSSIONS- DEPENDING ON WHEN. WE'RE FOREST THERE THERE MAY BE SOME DELAYS. REGARDING THE INVEST FOR THE AND IMPROVE THAT AREN'T THE TECHNOLOGY- WE ARE ALL IN THIS THIS FIVE FOR OFFICE- WHERE HAVE PRIOR TO OF STAFF TO THE PROJECT COORDINATING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY TO. WORK WITH OUR LARGER STAKEHOLDER BURKE SO I THOUGHT BACK TO KIDS AND FAMILIES LOOKING TO IDENTIFY SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT INFORMATION. FOR LISTING COMPONENT OF THE CLIENTS. CURRENT RECORD SYSTEM AND THEN OF COURSE REGIONAL CENTERS WILL BE INCLUDED IN PROVIDERS ON SOME OF THE INFORMATION OF EXISTING AND NEW DATA FOR SOME OF THE FUTURE. NEEDS OF. WE'LL JUST TELL YOUR QUESTION- WE HAVE THE ARE WE WERE AWARE A FEW STATES THAT HAVE. DEVELOPED FROM CHECK SYSTEMS SO RESTART TO GET SOME OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS TO IDENTIFY WITH SOME OF THEIR CHALLENGES ARE IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES WORK HOPING OF COURSE TO LEARN FROM THAT- LEVERAGE ANY OF THAT. EFFORT WE'RE ALSO LOOKING TO LEVERAGE ANY OPPORTUNITIES FROM THE CURRENT DATA EXCHANGE FRAMEWORK THAT THEY CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY IS COORDINATING. SO ALTHOUGH THE TYPICAL TIMELINE FOR THESE PROJECTS CAN TAKE SEVERAL YEARS TO COMPLETE GIVEN THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF THE PROJECT- WE WILL BE LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO ACCELERATE AND OF COURSE BASED ON SOME OF THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM OTHER ENTITIES. MAKE SOME OF THOSE IMPROVEMENTS. I THINK ISSUE FIVE THIS OF THE DISK TALKED ABOUT. HOW WE MIGHT IMPLEMENT SOME OF THE PERFORMANCE SPACE MEASURES WITHOUT THE SYSTEMS IN PLACE. AND I THINK ONE OF THE CLEAREST DISTINCTIONS WAS. BROUGH BURKE FIFTY AT THE END OF SOME OF THIS WILL ALLOW US TO INCORPORATE SOME OF THAT THAT DATA NEEDS IN THE SYSTEMS TODAY- AND IN THE MEANTIME SHORT TERM WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT WAYS TO VENTURES THAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH WITH. SURVEYS OR- WOW PROJECTIONS TO THE EXISTING SYSTEMS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM CHRIS I'D MAIL WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- CHRIS SUTTON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD. NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM SONYA PADDOCK WITH THE L. L. THANK YOU DR AMBULANCE MEDICAL WITH THE LA- O. AND- THE AGENDA REYES TO MANY OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE HAD HAD WHICH THE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED TO SO I'LL JUST KEEP IT- ADDITIONAL COMMENTS BRIEF BUT- OUR PRIMARY CONCERN AND I'M SURE THIS IS EVERYBODY'S PRIMARY CONCERN IS JUST ENSURING THAT THESE MANY NEW INITIATIVES ARE ARE IMPLEMENTED SUCCESSFULLY. AND TO THE BENEFIT OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED- AND WE ALSO HOPE THAT OF COURSE IMPLEMENTATION WILL BE EFFICIENT SO I THINK OUR MAIN CONCERN WHICH WE REYES THROUGHOUT THIS HEARING TODAY IS JUST TO THE EXTENT THAT ISSUES OR CHALLENGES IT'S BEGIN TO ARISE OR THE DEPARTMENT HAS NOTICED THAT MAYBE SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE CHANGED OR MODIFIED DDS WILL HAVE A- A PROCESS IN PLACE FOR SORT OF FLANKING THESE ISSUES AND SUGGESTING MODIFICATIONS AND FOR KEEPING THE- THE LEGISLATURE APPRISED. OF THOSE CHALLENGES AND WHAT THEY RECOMMEND- DOING IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THOSE CHALLENGES AND YOU KNOW I'LL JUST GIVE ONE EXAMPLE FROM THE PAST I MEAN I DO THINK THE SYSTEM IS IN A DIFFERENT. DIFFERENT PLACE. NOW THAN IT WAS IN SAY TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN BUT- AT THAT TIME THE DEPARTMENT HAD BEEN GIVEN FUNDING. FOR THE- INCENTIVES FOR COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED. AND OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS IT STARTED TO COME TO LIGHT THAT THE DEPARTMENT WAS REALLY UNABLE TO USE MUCH- HARDLY ANY OF THAT FUNDING RELATED TO PROVIDE THOSE INCENTIVES LIKE THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A PROBLEM- IN. HOW EMPLOYMENT WAS BEING APPROACHED AND I MEAN THERE'S STILL A PROBLEM WITH TRYING TO GET THOSE INCENTIVES OUT THE DOOR SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THOSE KINDS OF PROBLEMS START TO CROP UP WITH ANY OF THE NEW INITIATIVES WE WOULD HOPE THAT THE DEPARTMENT WOULD NOT LET THE LEGISLATURE NO SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. SHOULD THERE BE CHANGES IN POLICY THAT WOULD HELP- IMPROVE. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE PROGRAMS NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM TIM CHEN ASSISTANT DIRECTOR WITH DISABILITY VOICES UNITED. MY NAME IS TIM CHEN I THINK THE SYSTEM DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS RIGHT SAID DISABILITY VOICES UNITED. YESTERDAY WAS MY BIRTHDAY SO I'M GONZALEZ FORTY SEVEN HE ROLLED CAREER IN AMERICAN MAN WHO HAS CEREBRAL PALSY. I AM USING A COMMUNICATION DEVICE AT THE BASE OF MY WHEELCHAIR BY TYPING WITH MY TOES. I AM HERE TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM HAS CHANGED MY LIFE AND ASK YOU TO BREAK DOWN THE BARRIERS SO THAT OTHER LIVES CAN BE CHANGED AS WELL. I WAS IN THE TRADITIONAL REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM FOR A VERY LONG TIME. I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT I WAS HAPPY WITH MY LIFE UNDER THE BROKEN SYSTEM BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW THAT I WAS EATING MEATLOAF EVERY NIGHT WITH KETCHUP.I FELT THIS WAY FOR PRETTY MUCH ALL OF MY LIFE. THE AGENCIES THAT HIRE THE PEOPLE TO SUPPORT ME NEVER ASKED WHAT THEY COULD DO BETTER. EVERYONE JUST ASSUMED THAT I WAS DOING FINE. IF YOU SWITCH THE LAST TWO LETTERS IN MY NAME IT SPELLS T. M. HI. SO I'M GOING TO BE VERY HONEST. UNDER THE TRADITIONAL SYSTEM I SUFFER FROM NEGLECT. BY STAFF CAME TO MY JOB ONLY ONCE DURING THE DAY TO HELP ME GO TO THE BATHROOM AND SHE'D BE LUNCH. THIS LED TO MANY TOILET ACCIDENTS BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE SUPPORT WHEN I NEEDED IT. I MISSED NUMEROUS LAUNCHES BECAUSE THE AGENCIES COULDN'T FIND RELIABLE PEOPLE TO HELP ME. THE AGENCIES WHICH SAID RANDOM STAFF WHO DIDN'T KNOW OR RESPECT ME. IF I WANTED TO GO OUT TO DINNER WITH FRIENDS OR FAMILY I HAD TO BE HOME BY EIGHT PM BECAUSE THAT IS WHEN THE SHIFT CHANGE HAPPENED. I NEEDED TO ASK. PERMISSION TO LIVE MY LIFE. SINCE I STARTED IN THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM I'VE BEEN SEEING FRIENDS THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN IN A LONG TIME. I NOW WORKOUT IN THE GYM FLOOR TO SIX TIMES A WEEK FOR AT LEAST A TWO HOUR SESSION. AND I HIRED STAFF REALLY KNOW HOW TO COOK. FINALLY THE BOTTOM LINE IS THERE IS NO LONGER APPROVAL NEEDED FROM A SUPERVISOR BECAUSE I AM IN CHARGE NOW IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME THAT OTHERS HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE SO MANY BARRIERS TO PARTICIPATION THAT FEW HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ENROLL. THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM FINALLY WENT STATEWIDE LAST JUNE. AFTER A VERY SLOW PHASING THE PROBLEMS AND BUREAUCRACY HAVE ONLY INCREASED. THERE IS NO CONSISTENCY BETWEEN REGIONAL CENTERS WITH LONG DELAYS AND STAFF PROVIDING HE WRONG INFORMATION WE CONTINUE TO HEAR OF REGIONAL CENTER STAFF DISCOURAGING CLIENTS AND FAMILIES FROM GOING INTO THE PROGRAM PARTICULARLY PEOPLE OF COLOR. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT INITIAL DATA SHOW THAT THE PROGRAM ACTUALLY REDUCING SOME OF THE SERVICE DISPARITIES THAT ACTUALLY THE TRADITIONAL SYSTEM IF WE CONTINUE TO SEE PROFOUND INEQUITIES IN THE ENROLLMENT OF LATINOS INTO THE PROGRAM WHO ARE DRASTICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED. THE CRITICAL NATIONAL MANAGEMENT SERVICES HAVE FACED THEIR OWN BUREAUCRATIC BARRIERS WITH WHO ALREADY LEAVING THE PROGRAM AND OTHERS PAUSING ACCEPTING NEW CLIENTS. THE WHOLE PROGRAM COULD GO INTO CRISIS UNLESS SOMETHING IS DONE TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE ABLE TO DO THEIR JOB WITHOUT UNNECESSARY OBSTACLES. M. THE BENEFITS OF THE S. DE YOUNG BUCKS PERSON HAS YET TO BE REALIZED SGPS HASN'T HIRED A PERMANENT PERSON FOR THE JOB YET. WHAT CAN BE DONE TO SAVE THIS PROGRAM THAT HAS REALLY SAVED ME. OVER THE NEXT MONTH HE VICKY YOU WILL BE PREPARING A SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS TO PRESENT TO D. D. S. SENATE THE LEGISLATURE. THEY WILL FOCUS ON TGS PROVIDING MORE CLEAR DIRECTION OVERSIGHT AND TRAINING OF DIGITAL CENTERS AS WELL AS SPECIFIC WAYS TO BREAK DOWN THE BUREAUCRACY. WE HOPE THAT TGS WILL TAKE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS SERIOUSLY BECAUSE I WANT EVERYONE WITH A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY LIKE ME TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS AMAZING PROGRAM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU TEMPER PROVIDING A GREAT VOICE. NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM CARIBBEAN HANSSON RETURNING WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA ALL. THANK YOU AND GOOD EVENING AGAIN. HE FELT PRETTY SHAPE THE COMMENT THAT CAN JUST MADE ABOUT THE TERMINATION AND BE HEARTEDLY SUPPORT FROM. BUT WE'LL TURN TO SOME OTHER IMPORTANT INITIATIVES IN OUR REMARKS TODAY ALL. WE'RE PLEASED TO KEEP DEDICATED FUNDING IN THE BUDGET OR LANGUAGE ACCENT AND CULTURAL COMPETENCY. FIRST LANGUAGE ACCESS IS A LEGAL RIGHT SO WE'RE GLAD THAT REGIONAL CENTERS ARE GETTING MORE FUNDING. AND LET'S NOT FORGET THAT LANGUAGE ACCESS ALSO MEANS RAIN LANGUAGE IT MEANS OF TRINIDAD AMENDED COMMUNICATION. IN EXILE INCLUDES ALL OF THE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT SELF ADVOCATE ADVOCATE. LANGUAGE JACKSON'S IMPORTANT AND IT'S NOT ENOUGH. THE PROBLEM ISN'T JUST ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THEM. WE FIND THAT USUALLY PEOPLE UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT REGIONAL ISN'T TELLING THEM. AND ALL TOO OFTEN WHAT THEY'RE HEARING IS NOW. HELLO BECAUSE OF DIFFERENT AGE YOU SHOULD BE FUNDING A SERVICE NO BECAUSE THE REGIONAL CENTER THANKS THE FAMILY MEMBER SHOULD PROVIDE A SUPPORT FOR FREE. NO BECAUSE THE REGIONAL CENTER DECIDE IT KNOWS BETTER THAN THE PERSON SAID ABOUT WHAT FACTORS AND. THERE NEED TO BE MORE INVESTMENT DESIGNED TO HELP REGIONAL TENSIONS THAT. ONE OF THOSE IS COORDINATED FAMILY SUPPORT. A SUPPORTED LIVING LIKE SERVICE WHAT ELSE WHO LIVE AT HOME WITH THEIR FAMILY. SUPPORT OF LIVING IS A SERVICE THAT MAKE THAT POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO READ INDEPENDENTLY IN HER OWN HOME. BUT A LOT MAKE FACTORS IS THAT THE ELBOW. YOU CAN AFFORD TO HAVE ON A- THREE. HURTS ADULTS WHO LIVE IN MY GENERATES HOUSEHOLDS WHO ARE INCREASE AND DISPROPORTIONATELY LOWER INCOME AND LATIN TAX COURT FROM OTHER COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. IT CONTRIBUTES TO THE HOUSING CRISIS AND EXACERBATE REGIONAL CENTER. SO WE WERE THRILLED LAST YEAR WITH THE CREATION OF A SIMILAR SERVICE SPECIFICALLY FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH FAMILY. WHY NEED ECONOMIC SUPPORT. WE HEARD FROM SPECIALLY THOSE OF COLOR WHO CALLED IT A POTENTIAL CHANGER. HOWEVER TO DATE DDS NOT PROVIDED CLARITY ABOUT THIS SCOPE OF SERVICES THAT WILL BE OFFERED UNDER THIS NEW MODEL. NOR HAVE DEPARTMENT IDENTIFIED HOW IT WILL ENSURE THAT THESE SERVICES WILL ACTUALLY REACH UNSERVED OR UNDERSERVED PEOPLE WHO NEED IT MOST. THIS PILOT PROJECT IS DESPERATELY NEEDED TO EXPAND HOUSING OPTIONS TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT OF CONGREGATE RESIDENTIAL SETTING AND TO DISRUPT PRODUCT DISPARITIES IN. IT NEEDS TO BE A DOCTOR. THERE ALSO NEEDS TO BE MORE OVERSIGHT TO HELP REGIONAL CENTERS JACQUI CONTEXT OF CAMP ESPECIAL RECREATION. THE RESTORATION OF CAMPAIGN SOCIAL RECREATION REPRESENTS A POTENTIALLY HUGE STEP TOWARD REDUCING SOME OF THE RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES THAT SERVICES REMAIN OUT OF REACH FOR PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES. FOR THEM A ROLLOUT HAS BEEN CONFUSING BETTER SHOT AND FLOW. SOME REGIONAL CENTERS ARE TURNING DOWN REQUESTS WHILE THEY AWAIT DIRECTION FROM DDR. OTHERS FELT THE TIMELY CONDUCT OUTREACH AND PUBLIC FIVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESTORATION OF THE SERVICE. SOME FAMILIES HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT REGIONAL CENTERS ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR TRANSPORTATION TO THE SERVICE. WHAT THE COMPANY OF THE CHILDREN AT ONE TO ONE SUPPORT ISN'T. WHAT EVERY FAMILY HAS A CAR AND NOT EVERY FAMILY CAN TAKE TIME FROM WORK. AS REGIONAL CENTERS DEVELOPED REGIONS THE SERVICE POLICY ON CAMPUS AND SPECIAL RECOGNITION HE URGED THEM TO TAKE A VERY CRITICAL. NOT JUST THAT EACH WITH THE OUR- BUT HOW THEY ACT THIS WHEN AND HOW SERVICE COORDINATORS APPROVED REQUESTS FOR THE SERVICES. OUR AND HOW THE PRACTICES COULD POTENTIALLY DESTROY RACIAL DISPARITIES OR INADVERTENTLY PERPETUATE. CHALLENGES ARE ILLUSTRATIVE OF A LARGE. WHICH IS THAT EVERY REGIONAL CENTER HAS THE ABILITY TO DEVELOP ITS OWN POLICIES AND- INTERNAL CONTROLS ABOUT WHEN AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES IT WILL APPROVE A SERVICE. SO WE END UP WITH TWENTY ONE DIFFERENT LEVEL POLICY. FOR SWEEPING CHANGES BE INVOLVING THE CREATION OR RECREATION ALL SERVICE TYPES WE NEED A STRONGER MORE ACTIVE. H. AND DDS WOULD BE FAR MORE EFFECTIVE. FINALLY SOCIAL RECREATION AND CAMPING AND COORDINATED FAMILY SUPPORT SERVICES WERE AMONG THE FEW INITIATIVES IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET AT WORK OKAY ON HIRING MORE STAFFERS EDS AND REGIONAL FACTORS OR ON BREAK FOR DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONAL. FOR REPORTER ROLES IN THE SYSTEM THAT IT'S NOT ABOUT. IT IS THE BALLOT AND FOR PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AND AFTER YEARS. OF DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT BUILDING OUT STAFF BUILDING OUT EACH THE DISABLED PEOPLE DESERVE MORE INVESTMENTS AND BALLOT IN EXPENDITURES. THAT GO DIRECTLY TO THEM. ONLY FINALLY HAVE THE KIND OF DIRECT INVESTMENT OF THE NATIONAL DESERVED TO BE PRIORITIES AND TO KEEP EMPLOYMENT OKAY AN URGENCY. THE DOUBLE FOR THINGS LIKE SOCIAL RECREATION AND COORDINATED FAMILY SUPPORT SERVICES THAT WERE LARGELY DESIGNED TO LIFT THAT DISABLED PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO'VE BEEN LEFT OUT AND LEFT BEHIND FOR OUR- ONE. DRC URGES REGIONAL CENTERS ET OCT. MINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE TO WORK TOGETHER WITH THE COMMUNITY THREE BILLION. THE REPORT WHEN INCIDENTS IN THE MANNER THAT DISABLED PEOPLE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM IN THE WEST WING EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF ARC. REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO- PRESENT ON THIS PANEL AND ADDRESS SOME OF THE SPECIFIC. IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS THAT ARE GOING FORWARD RIGHT NOW ON THE RADIO BUT MICHIGAN'S THAT WORK ON INTRODUCED AND INCLUDED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET AND- BOTH THE NATION'S QUICKLY OFF THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE THE OIL PIPES AND SERVICE DELIVERY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I WAS ASKED TO SPEAK ON SPECIFIC PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS AS WELL AS. TO MAKE HIM FOR CONCRETE. EGGMAN DACIAN FOR. HOW TO MAKE IT FROM ONE FACT. SO I WANT TO SPEAK THIS EVENING- REACH TOPICS AND I THINK THURSDAY TO THE ONES THAT WE FOR OTHERS PRESENT FROM THIS EVENING ALREADY FIRST A SOCIAL RECREATIONAL YEAH SECOND SUPPLEMENTATION AND BIRD THE PERFORMANCE AND SANTA BARBARA. IT WORKED PRETTY RIGHT AND THE IS A FINAL. OFFER ARGUS ADVOCATING FOR THE- OF SOCIAL WORKING CAMPS SINCE AT LEAST TWENTY SEVENTEEN. BECAUSE HE UNDERSTANDS THE EVIDENCE RESPOND DRESSED UP JUST. NO DATE IS REALLY IS THAT HAS THE UPPER TO PROVIDE PEOPLE WITH SOMETHING THEY DESPERATELY NEED VETERANS GREATER ACCESS TO THEIR COMMUNITY. WE KNOW THAT THESE SERVICES FOR FORMALLY IN GREATER QUANTITIES BY NON WHITE COMMUNITIES THAT WHAT'S THE BASIS OF OUR ADVOCACY ON THIS ISSUE FROM YEARS. SO WE'RE GOING TO SPEAK THAT WORKS. THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN FOCUS WE AND BACK TO CHIU IN. HOW THINGS YOU TO BE AND SO OF THAT IS FOR THE- BECAUSE WHAT WE USED HAPPEN PLACE WHEN WE SOCIAL WORK READ AND SERVICE SIX. BARTLETT'S STATIC. I WHITE HOUSE CHIEF FOR PEOPLE WITH THE BOX DISABILITIES FOR. SINCE THE TIME. WITH THE EMPLOYMENT. OF HOW MANY BASED SERVICES FINAL. AND WE EXPECT THESE SERVICES BE FOR IN THE INTEREST BY NOW. AND SO THERE ARE HUGE CHALLENGES WITH GETTING THERE ONE OF THEM IT IS WITH IDENTIFYING AND BUILDING UP OUR PROVIDER NETWORK. MANY PROVIDERS THAT PROVIDED THE SERVICE SINCE ALSO PROVIDE OTHER SERVICES THAT ARE STRETCHED THIN DURING THE PANDEMIC AND WE ARE ENGAGING WITH THEM TO CRIED BUILD THAT NETWORK BACK UP. R. AS WELL AS THE ART CALIFORNIA WILL BE CO HOSTING A WEBINAR NEXT MONTH. TO HELP PROVIDERS GET THROUGH THE FACTORIZATION PROCESS ADDITIONALLY WE ARE GLAD TO SEE FINANCIAL TRACKING THAT WILL HELP US TO ASSESS THE FULL SPENDING PICTURE. IN ITS AREA. IN OF STEPS BEING TO. WE ARE LOOKING AT STUFF THE STUFF THAT ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT PAYMENT IN ARREARS AND ARE WILLING TO PROVIDE INTEGRATED COMMUNITY ACTIVITY LEVELS. AND AS A POTENTIAL SOURCE FOR. THE NEW YORKER TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES TO PHONE STILL IN THE TRADITIONAL CIRCUMSPECT STOCK. REGIONAL CENTERS ARE DOING OUT REGIONALLY THESE DISCUSSIONS ALSO DURING THEIR EXPENDITURE COMMUNITY THINGS WHICH ARE COMING UP SOON SO IN THIS ONE THERE IS PROGRESS BEING MADE AND IT JUST NEEDS A BIT MORE TIME TO COME TO FULL FRUITION. IN TERMS OF SELF DETERMINATION THANK YOU FOR THAT EIGHT IF YOU WERE PROGRAM IS HAVINGTODAY IT IS IT'S HAVING GROWING. PUBLIC **** BURLINGTON FRIEDMAN BUT. IT'S FAR AWAY. THE BIGGEST ISSUE RIGHT NOW. WHICH HAS BEEN A WILL TO ALL BUSY THINK YOU THIS WAY THE- FINANCIAL MEANT SERVICES. INCLUDING ACCESS. AND WE OTHERS BY THERE ARE CHEN WITH THIS. AND APPRECIATE IT APARTMENTS IN ALMOST ALL. AND THERE IS TO SCHEDULE NEXT WEEK CHOI. HOW THE MAKE THE FMS SYSTEM WORK BETTER FOR PROVIDING. ALSO VOTERS IN THE WHO WANT TO THE SUBJECT NATION FOR. ANYTHING OVERALL THE QUESTION IN THE CELL DETERMINED FOR. THINK ABOUT EQUITY AND ACCESS IS HOW TO MAKE THE PROGRAM LAST FIVE INTENSIVE OVERALL. IN TERMS OF THE BOOK AND SECOND PROGRAM WERE BROUGHT TO FIT WITH THE SYSTEM IS GOING UP OF THE- OF SERVICES ON PEOPLE LIVES. THIS IS THE RIGHT THING. MEASURE HOW WE CAN PEOPLE'S LIVES RATHER JUST WHAT PROVIDE ABOUT. WE ARE. THAT PERFORMANCE VENTURE FOR ME FOR ALL PUT ON AS OUR- TO. MAKE SURE THAT AND BRING. THIS IS AN ALBUM AND- UNDER BY IT ABSOLUTELY NO RIGHT THING TO DO. WE THAT THIS BURKE ABOUT AND FOR NATION WHICH IS THE DIRECT SERVICE THAT EVERYONE'S BY A REGIONAL RECEIVES. AN OBSCURE WEAPON. FOR STRENGTH. THE SENATE GOING. NUMBER WE ARE EXCITED TO SEE BE IMPRESSED IN B. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS WE NOTE THAT IS BOTH SYSTEMS THE BELLHOPS WHICH WILL OUR CAPACITY THAT MEASURE WHO REPORTS CENTERED OUT A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW. TO PREVENT THAT THE STATE OF THE INVESTMENT IN SERVICE. PORTAL YOU SHOULD. AND THIS TIME DONE. AS OUR AND AS THE IDEA WHO OPPOSE- UNDERLYING CENTER FUNDING KNOWN AS THE STAFF AND FOR ON THE FORM HE IS REGIONAL ONLY PROPERTY OFF THE BACKS FIRING EACH SERVER FOR MANY.

AT THOSE ARE GOING STRONG ITS RECORD. BUT I CAN MAKE AN ABOUT FIVE. RICH GAVE. I'LL OF IMPLEMENTATION. SO AS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS I BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE THE RIGHT OVERSIGHT AND- I'M GLAD THAT WE WERE ABLE TO. PROVIDE AND- HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW WE CAN MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE MULTITUDE OF PROGRAMS THAT WERE BEGAN LAST YEAR. WITH THAT I WILL SAVE MY QUESTIONS AND FOLLOW UP AS I REALLY AGREED ON THE NEED FOR US TO HAVE FOCUS AND URGENCY TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE PROGRAMS AS I BELIEVE THEY WILL ALLOW US TO. WORK TOWARDS A MORE EQUITABLE SYSTEM FOR ALL IN RTD'S. SYSTEM WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO PUBLIC COMMENT RE ITERATE THAT IF THE DEPARTMENT HAS NOT PROVIDED WRITTEN RESPONSES PREVIOUSLY TO OUR QUESTIONS CAN WE PLEASE WORK WITH MY STAFF SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THAT INFORMATION BY EARLY APRIL.

YES I'M HERE CAN YOU HEAR ME OK. LOUD AND CLEAR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- CARL LUNDEN A MAP THE ALLIANCE FORTY PEOPLE WITH TYPE II OUR ORGANIZATION REPRESENTING PROVIDERS THAT DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FIRST I WANT TO- ASSOCIATE ARE ORGANIZATIONS WITH THE RATE STUDY COMMENTS MADE BY JORDAN LINDSAY TODAY BY THAT- PERHAPS THE LAND RENT COALITION- ONE THING I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS FROM COMMENTS MADE EARLIER BY REPS. FOR A DISABILITY BOYCE'S UNITED D. R. C. THEY'RE SOMEWHAT MISLEADING. FIRST IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ALL REMEMBER THAT ANY RAISES IN RATES GIVEN TO PROVIDER ORGANIZATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE CAP. OF FIFTEEN PERCENT. THAT IS BEEN PLACE FOR SEVERAL YEARS. SO THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF ANY FUNDS GOING TO PROVIDERS GHOST RECKLESSNESS SERVICES ON THE WAGES OF STAFF BY LAW. SAKET YOU CAN'T SIMPLY THEN IGNORE THE FACT THAT OTHER COSTS SUCH AS WORKERS COMP. UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE RATE GAS OTHER ITEMS. HAVE RISEN AND MUST ALSO BE ADDRESSED- NO PER IS INVOLVED THE PROVIDER IN THEIR COMMUNITY UNLESS BY CHOICE IS CONSTRUCTED THEIR INDIVIDUALIZED PROGRAM PLANNED. SOME MAY THINK THAT THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE REINVENTED TO ACCOMPLISH A- PERSON CENTERED APPROACH. THE FACT IS THAT THERE ARE YOU JUST THAT WAY- I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO BRIEFLY COMMENT ON THE EMPLOYMENT ISSUE AND REITERATED COMMENTS MADE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MATHIS RUBIO AND YOURSELF. DESPITE PASSING AN EMPLOYMENT FIRST RATE STATUTE INTO LAW IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. OUR PRIMARY FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH IDEAS CONTINUE TO STAY FLAT. AND EVEN DROP IN IT'S NOT AS THE DEPARTMENT SAYS SIMPLY DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. A MAJOR CONCERN WE HAVE IS THAT THE DATA ON EMPLOYMENT OF OUR POPULATION SIMPLY INADEQUATE. AS AN EXAMPLE YOU YOU. AND YOUR COMMITTEES OVER TIME BOB PRICE CLOSE TO A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. FOR COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT AND PAID INTERNSHIP PROGRAMS. WE SHOULD KNOW HOW WAS THE CONCERT WORKING DEFINITIVELY BUT WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA THAT SHOWS THE QUALITATIVE QUANTITATIVE OUTCOMES FROM THESE PROGRAMS. THE DEPARTMENT'S PROPOSAL TO SPEND EIGHT MILLION NOW IN A DEMONSTRATION PROJECT. IN EMPLOYMENT IS VAGUE AND WE URGE YOU GET MORE DETAILS ON HOW THIS WILL ADDRESS. THESE ISSUES BEFORE MAKING ANY COMMITMENTS. I ALSO URGE YOU CONSIDER OFFRAMP FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SB SIX THIRTY NINE. IF WE DON'T HAVE GOOD DATA. ANY GAME PLAN IN PLACE THAT WILL WORK- ALSO ONE TO RAISE THE SOMETHING NOT IN YOUR AGENDA AFFECTING. UP AND DOWN STATE. WHEN THE CULPRIT NINETEEN PANDEMIC HIT IN MARCH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. MANY PROVIDERS WHICH ARE BUSINESSES TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S OFFER FOR PPP LOANS. LARGELY BECAUSE IT WAS UNCERTAIN. AS TO HOW THEY WOULD KEEP THEIR DOORS OPEN WHEN THE ONLY WAY THEY GET PAID IS PROVIDING A DIRECT SERVICE. TO CONSUMER AND THEN BILLING FOR IT. THE DEPARTMENT DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES NOW NEARLY TWO YEARS LATER. HAS LEFT OPEN A DIRECTIVE THAT THEY WANT TO CLAIM FUNDS FROM ANY PROGRAM THAT SOUGHT SUCH ALL. THIS CANNOT BE THE STANDARD AND WE ARE TO SEARCH THE LEGISLATURE TO STEP IN. TO THE SWEET THE DEPARTMENT FROM PURSUING THAT PATH. PUBLIC FOR DISCUSSING. THIS FURTHER WITH YOU YOUR STAFF THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SIR OPERATOR NEXT CALLER PLEASE. NEXT WE'LL GO TO LINE TWO FORTY TWO PLEASE GO AHEAD. WELL THANK YOU AND CHAIRMAN PERAMBALUR FOR HEARING US AND I AM. A MEMBER OF THE INCLUSIVE DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND I AM ACTUALLY TOTALLY BY MYSELF AS WELL I ALSO WORKED FOR TEN YEARS AND COUNSELING AND LATER ON JUST COUNSELING EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND- CRISIS INTERVENTION AND THEN I PROVIDED THAT SERVICE ADAM PLANETARY CENTER LOCALLY FOR ANOTHER NINE YEARS AND IN MY COUNSELING EXPERIENCE. I DID EXPERIENCE THIS WITH PEOPLE THAT GO THROUGH VISION LOSS AND SO I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT FIRST PANEL THAT DEALT WITH CLIMATE SERVICES. WHEN I THERE WERE SOME COMMENTS MADE ABOUT PEOPLE WHO. THEIR VISION THAT WE WANT SERVICES IN ORDER TO. GET ADJUSTED TO THEIR HOME LIFE AND BE ABLE TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY AND THEN EVENTUALLY GO TO WORK WELL. WHEN PEOPLE ARE ASKED IF THEY WANT TO WORK THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO IMAGINE WORKING AND IN MY COUNSELING EXPERIENCE WHEN YOU FIRST LOSE YOUR VISION AND WITH OTHER CAPABILITIES AS WELL IMAGINING THAT WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO MATCH YOUR CLOTHES DO YOUR LAUNDRY DO YOU BASIC HOUSEHOLD AND GROOMING TAX. IT'S REALLY IMPOSSIBLE I THINK WE'RE ASKING SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE CAN'T EMOTIONALLY DO UNTIL THEY GET SERVICES. AND SO. A LOT WITH MENTAL. AND OTHER SERVICES STAYING IN THE HOME I THINK IT WOULD PROVIDE THOSE ON THE FRONT END WE WILL ACTUALLY SAVE MONEY ON THE BACK END BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL BECOME EMPLOYED. MORE OFTEN OR BE ABLE TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY AND NOT IN TRAINERS COM THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY.

IMPLEMENTATION I THINK THE WAY I LOOK AT THAT AS WE WERE GETTING A LOT OF REALLY FUN EXCITING INITIATIVES. COMING OUT OF DDS IN THE GRAMMAR OF THE LEGISLATURE IN TERMS OF NEW- NEW OUTCOMES AND NEW PAUL AND NEW POSSIBILITIES FOR SERVING INDIVIDUALS. WHAT I SEE IS THE INCREASE IN THE RATE STUDY THE PAPER APPLICATION AND IT REALLY BOILS DOWN TO THE ALTERNATE SERVICE MODEL THAT WE DID OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. WE NEED THAT LIFELINE IN ORDER TO GET OUR SERVICE SERVICES STABILIZER THAT WE CAN THEN. LOOK AT TAKING ON SOME OF THESE OTHER INITIATIVES- FOR EXAMPLE I YOU KNOW I DO- BUT MONTHLY CALL ABOUT EVERYBODY THAT WE SERVE. AND IT'S REALLY- CHALLENGING LOOK PEOPLE IN THE AYE THIS POINT TWO MONTHS OR TWO YEARS AND EXCUSE ME. AND SAY THAT WE STILL ARE NOT ABLE TO GET STAFF.

THE CONTENTS OF TODAY'S SESSION WHICH IS BLOOMING AS BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE INVESTMENTS THAT WERE. GIVEN TO OUR COMMUNITY AND LONG OVERDUE LAST YEAR- WHAT I REALLY WANT TO SHARE IT'S GOT A FEW THINGS- FIRST BUSINESS YEAR- ALL HEARTED. WELL CORRODED- SUPPORT OF ACCELERATION RATES STEADY IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT KIND COMMON OF ALL THE INITIATIVES THAT COME THROUGH THIS PAST YEAR AND ALL THE THINGS THAT WERE MENTIONED IN TODAY'S HEARING IS THAT THEY'RE PREDICATED ON HAVING PEOPLE TO PROVIDE SERVICE. WITHOUT PEOPLE TO PROVIDE SERVICE IT BECOMES VERY CHALLENGING TO MEET ANY OF THE- NEED FOR THE INITIATIVE DEMOCRATS PUT FORTH. SO OUR COMMUNITY IS IN BADLY NEEDED OF. THAT INVESTMENT WHICH IS. GIVEN PROVIDED TOUCH WITH IMMEDIACY AND URGENCY I WANT TO STRESS. THE NEED FOR THAT THE SECOND PIECE OF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT A FEW OF MY COLLEAGUES TODAY HAVE MENTIONED WHICH IS. WE NEED TO AVOID THIS SITUATION MOVING FORWARD IT TOOK. REPAYMENTS FROM ADVOCACY GROUPS AND CERTAINLY PASSED FOR FROM THE LEGISLATURE TO ACTUALLY PROMOTE THIS LONG OVERDUE INVESTMENT. WE NEED TO AVOID THAT MOVING FORWARD BY HAVING A REGULAR RATE UPDATES SO THAT WE CAN ADJUST AS THINGS MOVE FORWARD AND ALSO AGAIN PROVIDING AVENUE FOR OUR WORK FORCE TO HAVE A LIVING WAGE AND TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT PEOPLE PURSUING A CAREER PATHS THAT THEY- ENJOY. SO INCLUDING AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AND I REALLY HOPE. THAT THE LEGISLATURE LOOKS VERY STRONGLY AT THE PROPOSAL TOOK FOURTH BUT WHEN A COLLISION THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

SHE LEFT SCHOOL WITH FUNCTIONAL COMMUNICATION BUT SHE ENTERED AN ADULT SERVICES WORLD WHICH WAS COMPLETELY UNPREPARED TO PROVIDE STAFF ABLE TO SUPPORT HER COMMUNICATION AS WELL THOSE OTHER COMPLEX NEEDS. I FOUND A REAL LACK OF EXPECTATION OF COMMUNICATION FOR THIS POPULATION AND THE AGENCIES SAY THEY DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER CLIENTS BY COUPON IN ANY PHYSICAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN AROUND. FOR THIRTY FIVE OR FORTY YEARS. WE ARE NOW IN OUR FIFTH YEAR OF WAITING FOR REGIONAL CENTER VANDER JARVIS'S THAT WERE AUTHORIZED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. WE'VE HAD EIGHT REFERRALS TO FLSA AGENCIES WHO SAY THEY CANNOT FIND STAFF WITH SKILLS TO SERVE HER AT EXISTING PAY RATES. CHIU AGENCY SAID THEY WOULD SUBMITHEALTH AND SAFETY WAIVERS TO GET A HIGHER PAY RATE AND THEN FAIL TO DO SO. OF THE TIME WE REQUESTED SERVICES MY HUSBAND HAS DIED I REMOVED FROM MY EARLY SIXTIES TO MY LATE SIXTIES. FROM SOMEBODY WHO WAS IN GOOD HEALTH TO SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN POOR HEALTH DUE TO THE- UNCEASING ROUND THE CLOCK CARE I HAVE TO PROVIDE BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER CHOICE ON TOP OF MY FULL TIME JOB. I WANT TO BE CLEAR WE HAVE NOT REJECTED ANY SERVICES THE AGENCIES HAVE REJECTED US. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T HIRE SKILLED STAFF NEAR MINIMUM WAGE. AND FURTHERMORE THERE THE SOS AGENCIES WERE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PROVIDE MANY OF THE SERVICES LISTED IN THE AFTERLIFE STATUTES AND REGULATIONS. THAT REQUIRE A HIGHER SKILL LEVEL. OF LAST YEAR THERE WERE TWO LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES PROPOSED I BELIEVE BY DRC BUT THEY WERE NOT DISCUSSED IN THE HEARING. ONE WOULD HAVE ALLOWED REGIONAL CENTERS TO ADJUST PAY RATES IN SITUATIONS BY GUARDS WERE VENDOR AGENCIES ARE UNWILLING TO DO THE WORK TO SUBMIT A HEALTH AND SAFETY WAIVER. THE OTHER INVOLVES REMOVING ANY BARRIERS FOR FLS SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED TO ADULTS WHO LIVE WITH THEIR FAMILIES THERE'S NO WAY WITH ALL THE GAPS IN SERVICES THAT MY DAUGHTER COULD LIVE ANYWHERE ELSE.

AND LIKE I HAVE PUBLICLY COMMENTED BEFORE SERVICES THERE ARE A LOT OF SERVICES BEFORE THE CHILDREN ARE THREE YEARS OLD AND THEN THEY TRANSITION INTO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND I REMEMBER HEARING COMMENTS ABOUT CERTAIN SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS NOW MY SON IS TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD. THROUGHOUT THE TIME WITH HARBOR REGIONAL THERE WERE NEVER ANY SERVICES OFFERED OTHER THAN REST TAKE CARE- MY SON IS ONE OF THOSE- AGGRESSIVE TYPE OF INDIVIDUALS- NONVERBAL. AND THERE REALLY ISN'T VERY LITTLE SUPPORT- THIS PAST YEAR TWENTY TWENTY- I HAD MY RICH BROKEN BY HIM AND MY FINGER- I DID CALL HARPER REGIONAL I CALLED THE PERSON AND THE SERVICE COORDINATOR AT THE TIME. AND REALLY NO HELP. THERE IS NO SUPPORT OUT THERE I KNOW THAT THEY HAVE THE NAME OF CRISIS INTERVENTION TEAM. BUT NEVER RESULTED IN ANY TYPE OF SUPPORT WHATSOEVER. REQUESTED A NEW SERVICE COORDINATOR COORDINATOR HOPING THAT THAT WOULD RESOLVE THE PROBLEM AND IT'S STILL AWAITING GAME IT STILL MIGHT SENATE SIXTY THREE. ANYWAY IT'S NOW FOR SIXTY FOUR POUNDS USED TO WAY TOO CLOSE TO FOUR NINETY POUNDS- I'VE BEEN WORKING OUT DILIGENTLY WITH HIM NOW THAT MY HEALTH IS BETTER- HELPING HIM TO LOSE THE WEIGHT AND TO LOWER HIS A. ONE C. BECAUSE HE WAS CONSIDERED A DIABETIC HE NO LONGER IS. BECAUSE THEY GET THE PRE DIABETIC BUT MY POINT HERE IS THAT HARPER REGIONAL IS SUPPOSED TO BE A CENTER THAT PROVIDES SUPPORT TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE THAT PROVIDES MENTORING FOR US SIMPLE WORKSHOPS ANNOUNCED IN THE BOOKLET ARE NOT ENOUGH- THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE BIT THERE WERE NO PHONE CALLS. THE PHONE CALLS THAT WERE MADE WERE INITIATED BY ME LIKE MANY OF THE OTHER PARENTS HERE. AN IT WASN'T UNTIL I MET- MEMBERS OF. THE LIVES OF IT GOMEZ AND THE OTHER MEMBERS THAT I REALIZED. THAT WE FINALLY HAD. SOMEONE WAS A BASICALLY TO FAMILIES SUCH AS MYSELF- VOICE. THE SOMEONE WAS ACTUALLY OUT THERE ADVOCATING FOR OUR FAMILIES. AND- WE NEED TO DO MORE WE NEED TO DO RIGHT BY OUR CHILDREN THEY NEED A HIGH. QUALITY OF LIFE THEY DESERVE A QUALITY OF LIFE JUST LIKE ANYONE ELSE IT'S SO HARD TO FIND GREAT GOOD DENTISTS THAT WILL CARE FOR KIDS. PEOPLE THAT WILL CUT THEIR HAIR PEOPLE THAT ARE GENUINELY INTERESTED IN THE WELFARE OF OUR CHILDREN WE NEED TO ATTRACT PEOPLE THAT WERE WILLING TO WORK WITH OUR CHILDREN. AND NOT JUST PULL ANYONE OFF THE STREET WE NEED TO PROVIDE TRAINING TO EVERYONE IN THE COMMUNITY AND SO PLEASE LISTEN TO US PLEASE LISTEN TO US I'M NOT ONLY A TEACHER BUT I'M THE PARENT OF A TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD NONVERBAL OCCURRED THINKING MAN.

HOW DO I NOT DO IT I'M A MOTHER HE IS MY CHILD. AND I'M JUST APPALLED AT THE FACT THAT THAT THE HARBOR OUR REGIONAL CENTERS ARE NOT DOING ENOUGH. IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF RED TAPE OUT THERE. WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO ALONG WITH CARING FOR OUR CHILDREN. HAVE TO ALSO BATTLE. BETWEEN AGENCIES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE THE SUPPORT. SO PLEASE LISTEN TO THE PARENT SURVEY YES DO WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH OF WHAT'S GOING ON. MY SON HAS BEEN A CLIENT FOR TO SINCE HE WAS TWO AND A HALF AND I HAVE NEVER EVER HEARD OF ANY OF THE PROGRAMS. UNTIL THIS YEAR. AND I'M AN EDUCATED PERSON I SPEAK FLUENT ENGLISH AND I SPEAK FLUENT SPANISH. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT MY LAST THING IS AND MY HUSBAND MY SON BLASTING IN VALENZUELA.

WHAT THE RESPONSE WILL READ MOVED TO LIVE THREE SIXTY IN LIGHT THREE FORTY SIX IF YOU'D LIKE TO ASK YOU ARE. STATE YOUR COMMENT PLEASE. VQ UP. LINE THREE SIXTY YOUR LINE IS OPEN. HELLO I'M A PARENT OF A THIRTY YEAR OLD. CHILD MAN OF AUTISM AND- I'M PLEASE TO KNOW I'M NOT ALONE IN MY- UNDERSTANDING AND EXPERIENCES- MY CHILD ALSO ONLY GOT SOME RESPITE CARE. UNTIL HE WAS- AND TEENAGE YEARS I WOULD SAY SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN. AND BY THEN IT WAS TOO LATE TO COORDINATE- ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD HAVE HELPED HIM SOCIALLY- THE MAIN. THING I CAN TAKE AWAY FROM THIS. TELL CON. IS THAT- NO WAY. IS BEYOND THE- BEING BIASED TO I HAVE A BEING ON A BLACKLIST IN MY SCHOOL DISTRICT. I HAVE EXPERIENCED- HAVING REGIONAL CENTER- COORDINATORS TELL ME THAT MY SON WAS ABSOLUTELY NORMAL BUT THAT- HE COULDN'T HAVE- SYRUPY SESSIONS ON HORSEBACK WHICH HELLO I HAD TO GO TO DUE PROCESS TO GET FOR HIM- THEY THEY DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HIPPO THERAPY. AND WHAT I WILL SAY IS ON A POSITIVE NOTE IT IS THAT ONE OF THE- PARENTS TALKED ABOUT- FINDING SUPPORT THROUGH LEADERSHIP. THE IT- IN OUR IN OUR LOCAL IN OUR GOVERNMENT OR IN OUR REGIONAL CENTERS BUT I THINK THE PARENTS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE A COALITION AND HAVE- I SHARING ONLINE AND PERHAPS MONTHLY LOCAL MEETINGS AND DO IT YOURSELF BECAUSE I DIDN'T GET ANY SERVICES IN O. T. SO I DID IT MYSELF I DIDN'T GET ANY SERVICES AND EDUCATION THREE OR FOUR YEARS OLD HE WAS TOO SMART DID IT MYSELF. AND I HAD TO GO THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE OF WITNESSING MY SON FALL BEHIND- FOUR YEARS IN SCHOOL AND BECOME A WORSE BEHAVIOR PROBLEM. AFTER WE SWITCHED TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND WENT FROM HAVING A SUCCESSFUL. BEHAVIORAL SYSTEM- THAT WE USED AT HOME AND AT SCHOOL. AND THAN BEING CATEGORIZED AS AN STD CLIENT AND HE WASN'T. SO YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO IS ABOVE AVERAGE IN I. Q. VERBAL- NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE THINGS IN HIGH SCHOOL LIKE CAR MECHANICS NO INVENTORY OF SKILLS CENTER COORDINATORS WHO SAT IN ON MULTITUDINOUS I. E. P. MEETING- THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT ARE DON'T TAKE ANYMORE REAL OCCURS TO ME IS THAT SOMEONE- NEEDS TO DESIGN A SYSTEM. WHERE EVERYONE THE CHILDREN ARE MOTIVATED TO BEHAVE IF THEY HAVE A BEHAVIORAL SYSTEM OR THEY'RE MOTIVATED TO LEARN YES THEY HAVE- NEEDS AN EDUCATION. AND I WOULD GO TO A NON PROFIT OR A SCHOOL- THAT IS DOING IT OUTSIDE THE BOX I WOULD NOT LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN PUBLIC SCHOOL. BECAUSE IT'S JUST WAREHOUSING I WENT TO AN ORGANIZATION CALLED HANDLE H. A. N. D. ELLIE AND SEATTLE. AND THEY GAVE ME SOME THINGS TO WORK ON AT HOME AND FIGURED OUT THAT MY SON'S EYES DON'T WORK. LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE'S AND- ALSO DIAGNOSED HIM WITH OTHER THINGS THAT I HAD TROUBLE GETTING- MY SCHOOL DISTRICT TO. I UNDERSTAND- I THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE AT FIRST OF ALL A NARROW PSYCH ITSELF FOR THESE CHILDREN. AND IT SHOULD BE DONE BY SOMEBODY IN THE REGIONAL CENTER IT SHOULD NOT BE DONE AT THE SCHOOLS BECAUSE THE SCHOOLS. R. O. T. AND THEIR THEIR PSYCHOLOGIST THEY JUST THEY HAVE A VERY VERY LIMITED TIME AND THEY DON'T COORDINATE WITH THE TEACHERS AT ALL. SO IF THIS GUY IS GOING TO TAKE MORE MONEY. I SUPPORT THE ARCA LAW WHICH I HAD THE PLEASURE OF LISTENING TO ON SENATE BILL SIX THIRTY NINE- DEFINITELY DEFINITELY FOR SOMEBODY WHO IS A AVERAGE TO ABOVE AVERAGE IQ AND SOME OF THESE KIDS WHO THEY SAY CAN'T LEARN THEY CAN LEARN AND THERE ARE THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH THEM YOU JUST HAVE TO. ASK THE PARENTS WHAT DO YOUR CHILDREN LIKE TO DO I DEVISED A PROGRAM OF SOCIAL PROGRAMS FOR THE- PEDIATRIC THERAPY NETWORK AND THEY THEY WOULD ALL WE DID WAS DROP A HINT AS TO WHAT THE ALL THE BOYS COULD DO AND THESE ARE MOSTLY BOYS. THAT THEY HAVE ON THESE THESE PROGRAMS ON A WHY IT TOO IS THAT WHY THEY HAVE SO MANY BOYS IN SPECIAL EDUCATION HAS SOMETHING GENETIC ABOUT THAT WOULD JUST SAY YOU KNOW TO PARENTS DO IT YOURSELF UNTIL THE MONIES COME IN BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE BETTER ORGANIZATION THERE NEEDS TO BE LESS MEETINGS WHERE THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT WE HAVE TO FILL OUT THIS THIS AND THIS AND WE'RE GOING TO GET SO AND SO ON BOARD AND IT'S ALL GOING TO BE GREAT BUT THERE'S NO TALK ABOUT WHAT IS ACTUALLY GOING TO HAPPEN GOING TO DO THIS. YOU KNOW AND THE ACHIEVEMENT STANDARD SHOULDN'T BE. JOHNNY WILL HOLD- A RATE AND HE WILL LEARN HOW TO WATER PLANTS OUTSIDE. YOU KNOW THAT KIND OF THING THAT'S RIDICULOUS. I WOULDN'T THINK THAT ANYBODY ANY ADULT WOULD WANT TO WASTE HOURS OF THEIR TIME DURING THE WORKDAY WHICH MY HUSBAND DID HOURS FOUR HOURS IT EVERY MONTH FOR ALL OVER TWO YEARS ALMOST WE WERE IN AN IEP MEETING. AND- JUST YOU KNOW NO NO NO THE ONLY THING WE WANT TO DO IS TO COME INTO A- WAREHOUSE LET THEM DEAL WITH IT. AND WHAT DO THOSE PEOPLE DO THEY TEACH THEM A SKILL OKAY YOU COORDINATORS SKILLED WITH- LEARNING IN THE CLASSROOM. IT'S LIKE HERE WE HAVE THESE CHILDREN THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE SO DIFFERENT. WHAT ARE THEY HOW ARE THEY LIKE THE REST OF THE POPULATION THAT'S HOW THIS ARC A PROGRAM IS GOING TO WORK IS BY FINDING OUT YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT THEY CAN DO MY SONHAPPENS TO BE REALLY REALLY GOOD AT COMPUTERS AND RENAME DRAMMEN STIMPY WHEN HE WAS FOUR YEARS OLD IF THAT MEANS ANYTHING TO ANYBODY- ANYWAY. I DON'T HAVE MUCH ELSE TO SAY EXCEPT THAT I WANTED TO GET ON THE CALL AND SUPPORT ARCA AND- LANDRUM IN COALITION BUDGET REQUESTS. AND YOU KNOW DON'T DON'T- GET RID OF THINGS LIKE- THE BUDDY SYSTEM OR THE SUPPORTIVE SUPPORTIVE ASPECTS FOR SOMEONE WHO IS WHO HAS NO FRIENDS OKAY THE CHILD HAS NO FRIEND HE'S NOT IN SPORTS SO THEN. YOU KNOW DON'T MAKE DON'T PULL THEM OUT AND MAKE THEM LOOK DIFFERENT. HELP TO GET THE MAINSTREAM YOU KNOW ALL OF THE AUTHORITY SAID MY CHILD SHOULD BE MAINSTREAMED AND- HE WITH HIS HIS BEHAVIORS FOUR POINT 001% POINT 002% AND THOSE DISTRICT WE WERE IN STOCK IN BACK IN SPECIAL EDUCATION BECAUSE HE HAD. DID STRANGE THINGS ON THE PLATE- HE DIDN'T DIDN'T PLAY WITH BALLS. WE KNOW NOW WHY HE DIDN'T PLAY WITH BALLS. HE COULDN'T PLAY WITH BALL HE CAN'T HE CAN'T DO IT NOW YOU THROW A BALL AT HIM HIS EYES. LOOK AT IT LIKE IT'S A MISSILE COMING AT HIM BUT HE CAN THROW A BASEBALL SIDEWAYS WHICH IS REALLY INTERESTING AND HIT A TARGET BECAUSE HIS EYES SEE OUTWARDLY. I MEAN THIS KIND OF THING. SHOULDN'T BE ROCKET SCIENCE SO- I DON'T KNOW IT TAKES. THE FIRST START WITH THE EVALUATION AND DON'T MAKE IT A PUBLIC SCHOOL ONE THAT SAYS THAT'S THE FIRST MISTAKE AND- DON'T OVER MEDICATE YOUR CHILDREN LIKE THOSE OTHER PEOPLE WERE SAYING THAT'S ANOTHER MISTAKE- YOU DON'T WANT TO WASTE TIME TIME IS THE ENEMY OF THE PARENT SAYS YOU CAN WATCH YOUR CHILD JUST GO DOWN THE DRAIN. AND THAT'S MY STORY MY SON IS THIRTY YEARS OLD HE IS NOT IN A GOOD STATE SITUATION RIGHT NOW- HE'S BEING SUPPORTED FINALLY YOU KNOW THE INCIDENT MAN HOUSING. BUT- YOU KNOW. SOMEBODY WE ACTUALLY HAD HOPES AND DREAMS FOR. SO ANYWAY HAVE A GOOD MEETING I WILL CLOCK OUT THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY THAT I WOULD GO TO ONE OF THE WORST MORE ACADEMY IN INDIANAPOLIS BRANDI JACKSON WON THE JEFFERSON AWARD AFTER WHAT TO DO.
