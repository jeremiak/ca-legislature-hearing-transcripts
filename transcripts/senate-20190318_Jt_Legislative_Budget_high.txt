THE FIRST GOAL OF OUR HEARING TODAY IS OPERATIONAL WHERE WE ARE HAVE TO ESTABLISH IN THAT THIS IS THE FIRST MEETING OUT -- THIS CURRENT LEGISLATIVE SESSION WE'VE GOT A DOCTOR COMMITTEE RULES ON AND ELECT A CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR. SECONDLY I'M GONNA PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE JAIL B. C.'S RESPONSIBILITY YOU KNOW THIS COMMITTEE IS COMMONLY -- MISTAKEN FOR EVEN THE BUDGET CONFERENCE -- ALL THREE OF THOSE INTO TV'S ENTITIES ARE SEPARATE AND EACH HAVE. A DISTINCTIVE FUNCTIONS THAT THEY SERVE ON BEHALF OF THE LEGISLATURE SOME GOING TO SPEND A LITTLE TIME PROVIDING CLARITY TO OURSELVES AND EVERYONE ABOUT THE ABSOLUTE. UNIQUE ROLE OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE. ONE OF OUR FINALLY WERE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS IN MORE DETAIL TO THE SECOND PART OF TODAY'S HEARING THE GOP SEES RESPONSIBILITY WITH REGARD TO APPOINTING THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S. AND OVERSEEING THE LA ELS OFFICE THE JAILBC MOST RECENTLY CARRIED OUT THIS RESPONSIBILITY BY UNANIMOUSLY APPOINTING GABRIEL ADDICT. WHO IS HERE WITH US TODAY AS OUR NEW LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S THAT APPOINTMENT WAS MADE IN JANUARY WE APPOINTED MR PANIC AFTER AN EXTENSIVE NATIONWIDE SEARCH? LED BY A BIPARTISAN BY CARAMEL SUBCOMMITTEE THAT I APPOINTED. THE SUBCOMMITTEE WAS CRUCIAL -- BECAUSE MOST OF THIS WORK WAS DONE DURING OUR LAST LEGISLATIVE INTERIM SELL THE SUBCOMMITTEE WISHES. TO THANKS TO ALL OF YOU YOU'RE WELCOME FOR HAVING THAT PULLED YOU INTO OUR EXTENSIVE WORK DURING YOUR INNER -- PERSON TO SERVE IN THIS ROLE IN THE SEVENTY SEVEN YEAR HISTORY OF THE LA JOH. I'D LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBERS TEEN AND OBERNOLTE AND SENATOR NIELSEN FOR SERVING WITH ME ON THE SUBCOMMITTEE. MY EXPECTATION IS THAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE IN THIS ENTIRE COMMITTEE WILL REMAIN ACTIVE IN SUPPORTING OUR NEW HIGHER ODDS IT IN SUPPORTING HIS SUCCESS IN SERVICE TO THE LEGISLATION TO THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA -- VERTICALLY IN THIS FIRST CRITICAL FIRST YEAR OF HIS SERVICE. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO INVITE THE VICE CHAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEAM TO MAKE ANY OPENING REMARKS YOU'D LIKE.

TO OUR WORK THIS -- DURING THE INTERIM AND AFTER THAT WILL MOVE INTO THE ORGANIZATIONAL COMPONENT OF OUR HEARING. VICE CHAIR TING. THANK YOU SO MUCH ON THAT LET ME ALSO JUST THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP -- WHAT SENATOR MITCHELL LEFT OUT AS MOST OF THE INTERVIEWS AND MEETINGS WERE RIGHT BEFORE THE? HOLIDAY BREAK IN DECEMBER SO IT WAS A WE WERE RIGHT THERE DOWN TO THE WIRE AND REALLY APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S TIME AND EFFORT AND THIS FABULOUS SUBCOMMITTEE. ON THE DURING THIS SEARCH GO ONLINE AND ACTUALLY REVIEW WHAT THE MISSION OF THE ORGANIZATION LAWS I THINK THAT. THE THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S IS AN ORGANIZATION THAT IS FRANKLY TREASURED. NOT ONLY IN SACRAMENTO NOT ONLY. IN THE IN THIS BUILDING BUT ALSO THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY BECAUSE IT'S ALSO THE AGENCY THAT THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE IS MODELED AFTER SO. IT'S INCREDIBLY HIGH PRAISE WHEN -- WASHINGTON DC DECIDES TO MODEL THIS ORGANIZATION AFTER ONE OF THEIR OWN AND IN REVIEWING THEIR IN REVIEWING THEIR MISSION JUST STRAIGHT FROM THE WEBSITE IT SAYS OFFICERS AS THE EYES AND EARS FOR THE LEGISLATURE. TO ENSURE THAT THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH IS IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATIVE POLICY IN A COST EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE. MANNER. I IN THE OFFICE IS KNOWN FOR ITS FISCAL AND PROGRAM AND EXPERTISE IN NONPARTISAN ANALYSIS OF THE STATE BUDGET. IN WHAT WE WHAT WE HAVE HIGHLY VALUED. AS A LEGISLATURE IS SO I THINK THE HIGHLY COMPETENT STAFF THE VERY EXCELLENT ANALYSIS OF WHAT. REALLY HAS BEEN PRODUCED OVER THE NUMBER YEARS HOWEVER I WAS ACTUALLY. SHOCKED TO FIND OUT THAT THE LA -- ACTUALLY REPORTS TO JAIL BC I DID YEAH BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S GOING. TO FIFTEENTH CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR WHEN YOU'RE VICE CHAIR YOU DON'T REALLY GET TO KNOW AS MUCH TEXAS -- THAT'S ALSO WHAT I WOULD THINK I FOUND OUT -- TO BUT YOU KNOW IT. DATE OUR DISCUSSIONS AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU KNOW CENTER MITCHELL CENTER NIELSEN THIS YOU KNOW MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE. I THINK WHAT WHAT YOU FOUND WAS JUST THIS COMMITMENT FROM BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE THAT WE REALLY WOULD LOVE OFFICE. TO BE WORKING MORE CLOSELY WITH US TO ACTUALLY HAVE A MORE POLICY DIALOGUE POLICY -- SORT OF POLICY THINK WITH THE THINKING THAT IS REALLY GOING ON BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S BEEN A FEELING THAT ANALYSIS. HAS BEEN STUNNED SOMEONE IN IT IN A VACUUM. AND THAT THE ANALYSISBALL EXCELLENT -- COMES OUT AND IT'S SORT OF QUESTION LIKE -- WELL WE'RE WE'RE THAT REPORT COME FROM OR WHAT CURIOUS WHY THEY'RE LOOKING AT THIS. YEAH I THINK THAT'S REALLY WHY WE'RE HERE DAYS REALLY TRY A NEW LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S WITH THE OFFICE. TRYING TO DEVELOP -- KIND OF A A LONGER TERM WORK PLAN WORKING RELATIONSHIP THAT WE CAN KIND OF WORK IN SYNC OBVIOUSLY THE ANALYSIS IS EXCELLENT WE REALLY I THINK. YOU KNOW THE THING SENATOR NIELSEN NOT TO STEAL FROM HIS THUNDER WAS WAS ALMOST WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT WE YOU KNOW HE DOESN'T HAVE TIME AND WE DON'T ALL HAVE TIME TO READ ALL THIS GREAT ANALYSIS NOW WE FEEL. IN SOME WAYS WE WOULD WE WOULD ALL BENEFIT FROM THIS I THINK IS REALLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THE INFORMATION IN THE RIGHT FORM. SO THAT WE CAN DIGEST IT AND NOW WE CAN REALLY GREATER. GREATER USE IT BUT THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT I LEAVE BEFORE OF US THAT THIS BODY COMPLETELY. TREASURES THE LA NOW IT'S REALLY JUST MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE IN GREATER SINK AND GREATER DIALOGUE WITH THIS VERY IMPORTANT ORGANIZATION. THIRTY WILL SEND. THAT MEANT CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR AND IT WAS A PLEASURE WORKING TOGETHER WITH YOU. AND ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL THINGS ABOUT THIS. IMPORTANT OFFICE IS THE INTEGRITY. THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE AVAIL. OTHER COMMITTEES BUT NOT SO. THE STUDIOS ARE BOUND NECESSARILY BUT THIS ONE IS AND THAT'S WHY IT'S BEEN REVERED OVER THE DECADES. NO SMALL REASON WHY IT LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN SO STABLE AND LONG TENURE. AND OUR DESIRE STICK TO KEEP IT IN THAT RESPECT AND THEN I WOULD OFFERED THAT. IF THERE'S ANY. OLD REMISS IT'S ON THE PART OF THE LEGISLATORS THEMSELVES NOT GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH THE LA -- AND WHAT YOU DO. AND IN FACT. PANEL ICING IN REVIEWING SOME OF THOSE MARVELOUS DOCUMENTS YOU PUT OUT. THEN I'D SAY MYSELF INCLUDED. IT DID AND I'M ALWAYS TRYING TO MAKE SURE THEY KEEP THOSE ON MY DESK SO I AM TEMPTED. TO FINISH AND READ THOSE VERY IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS OF AND AND IT HAS BEEN A GREAT CREDIT MISSION AND THIS REPUTATION THAT WE HAVE HAD THE LEGEND MOST OVER THE YEARS AND IT WAS A GREAT PLEASURE WORKING TOGETHER WITH MY COLLEAGUES HERE -- YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE CRITICIZE THE LEGISLATURE FOR BEING TOO PARTISAN YOU THEN YOU SHOULD BUT WATCHED THE WORK OF THE FOR A MEMBERS THAT WERE ON THAT REVIEW COMMITTEE. AND HOW WE WORK TOGETHER SO WELL AND SO UNANIMOUSLY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THE SUBCOMMITTEE I THOUGHT THAT YOU DID AN EXEMPLARY JOB AND KEEPING THIS COMMITTEE. ALIGNED AND MOVING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND I AM EXTREMELY PROUD THAT WE WERE ABLE TO REACH A UNANIMOUS CONCLUSION ON THE DECISION TO HIRE. MR PRODUCT I SHARE MY COLLEAGUES OPTIMISM IN THE FUTURE OF OF THE LA -- I ALSO THINK I SPEAK FOR THE ENTIRE SUBCOMMITTEE WHEN I SAY THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A CLOSER RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ALEJO. AND NOT ONLY JUST THE JAIL BC BUT THE ENTIRE LEGISLATURE. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE FISCAL ANALYSIS BE DONE ON BILLS OUTSIDE THE PURVIEW OF THE BUDGET WHICH IS WHAT THE ONLY -- USED TO DO BEFORE THE PASSAGE OF PROP ONE FORTY IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE THE BUDGET OF THE LA -- WAS CUT I THINK THERE WOULD BE A VERY HELPFUL THING. TO HAPPEN THE LEGISLATURE I ALSO THINK THAT THE ONLY -- HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR BEING THE THINK TANK FOR THE LEGISLATURE. YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE REALLY BIG SYSTEMIC THINGS LIKE. PERVASIVE POVERTY AND HOMELESSNESSAND THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING AND BUSINESS FLIGHT ALL OF THESE THINGS. THERE WHAT THE LITERATURE IN SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY BECAUSE WE COULD PROBLEMS AND WE IN THE LEGISLATURE. GET SOMETIME SO HEADS DOWN PREPARING TO FOR VOTES ON THE THOUSANDS OF BILLS THAT -- THAT COME THROUGH OUR DESKS. THAT WE SOMETIMES LOSE SIGHT OF THE BIG PICTURE AND I THINK THE ONLY -- HAS THAT OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT AND IT KIND OF LOOKS AT THE BIG PICTURE AND COMES UP WITH. A CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO SOME OF THOSE PROBLEMS AND SHARES WITH THE LEGISLATURE SO I'M I'M EXTREMELY EXCITED ABOUT WORKING WITH THE LA -- MOVING FORWARD LIKE TO THINK MADAM CHAIR YOURSELF AND THE MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE FOR THEIR DILIGENCE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH COLLEAGUES IT WAS INDEED MY PLEASURE TO WORK WITH YOU I THINK WE FELL SHORT IN ONLY ONE AREA AND THAT'S THE FACT THAT WE MISSED PRONOUNCE MR BUT HEADACHES NAME DURING OUR ENTIRE PROCESS WE SPENT THE ENTIRE PROCESS. CALLING HIM MISTER PATEK AND SO IF YOU SEE ME HICK UP AS I SAY IS NAME IS BECAUSE I'VE GOT TO GET THE THE WRONG. FOR NOT IT MIGHT BE AT A REPLACE IT THAT WILL HOW DID STELLAR WORK AND I THANK YOU -- WE'RE GOING TO MOVE INTO THE ORGANIZATIONAL COMPLAIN OF THE HEARING IN THE ADOPTION OF COMMITTEE RULES. ON THE COMMITTEE LAST ADAPTED RULES IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THERE'S NO SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES TO THE RULES BEFORE US TODAY THEY CAN BE FOUND ON PAGES THREE TO FOUR OF YOUR BACKGROUND DOCUMENT COLLEAGUES.

THAT MEASURE ALSO CARRIES IS -- PASSED UNANIMOUSLY -- BASED ON ALL THE MEMBERS PRESENT VOTING HIGH NEXT COLLEAGUES WILL MOVE ON TO ITEM THREE ARE ON OUR ORGANIZATIONAL HERE IN OVERSIGHT OF THE LA ELS AGENDA OVERVIEW THE JAY I'LL BE FREE -- AS MY COLLEAGUE -- MISTER TING MENTIONED AS WE BEGAN TO DO OUT REACH. OUT TO JAIL BC MEMBERS ONCE WE LEARNED OF THE RETIREMENT OF THE FORMER ALEJO -- WE HAD SEVERAL MEMBERS SAY THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE HAVE OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY OF THE OF THE LA NOW. I'M STILL A PART OF OUR COMMITMENT WE MAKE TO EACH OTHER DURING THE SELECTION PROCESS WAS TO CONVENE THIS HEARING EARLY IN THE YEAR YEAR NOT JUST TO DEAL WITH THE ORGANIZATIONAL -- REQUIREMENTS OF THE STAB RESELL TO THE COMMITTEE BUT ALSO GO A LITTLE DEEPER IN TERMS OF THE ROLE THE JB JAIL BC. AND OUR RELATIONSHIP -- AS REPRESENTED AT THE FULL LEGISLATURE WITH THE LA OUT. SO A LITTLE BACKGROUND THE LEGISLATURE ESTABLISH A JAIL B. C. IN NINETEEN FORTY ONE AT THE SAME TIME THEY CREATED THE LA L. AROUND THAT TIME CALIFORNIA SURPLUS FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER A DECADE OF DEFICITS THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR. THEN GOVERNOR ALL SET IN THE LEGISLATURE IT WERE IN CONFLICT OVER THE STATE BUDGET AND THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINE IT WANTED ITS OWN SOURCE OF INFORMATION FREE FROM THE CONTROL OR INFLUENCE OF THE ADMINISTRATION. THIS DESIRE FOR INDEPENDENT INFORMATION FOR THE CREATION OF BOTH THE JAIL B. C.AS WELL AS THE LEDGE ANALYST'S OFFICE. SO TODAY THE JAIL BC HAVE THREE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES. THE FIRST IS TO REVIEW ON BEHALF OF THE LEGISLATURE CHANGES OR OTHER ACTIONS THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSALS RELATE PROPOSES RELATED TO A BUDGET THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN ENACTED. THE JAIL BC. RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED OR MORE OF THESE NOTIFICATIONS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ALL YEAR LONG. PROPOSED CHANGES RANGE FROM EXPENDED A SMALL AMOUNT OF ON ANTICIPATED FEDERAL FARMS TO TRANSFER IN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM THE STATE'S RESERVES IN RESPONSE TO AN EMERGENCY. THE CHART ON PAGE TWO OF YOUR BACKGROUND -- GIVES -- SUMMARIZES SOME OF THE MOST COMMON NOTICES WE RECEIVE. THE LA OVERSEAS THESE NOTICES AS WELL AND THE LA L. OFTEN PROVIDES A WRITTEN ANALYSIS RELATED TO THE NOTIFICATION. ALL JAIL BC MEMBERS RECEIVE A COPY OF THE LA ELS ANALYSIS OF THESE REQUESTS. IN MOST INSTANCES THE LACK OF RESPONSE IN THE GOP SEE MEANS THE PROPOSED ACTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY TAKE EFFECT. ON BEHALF OF THE COMMITTEE HOWEVER I MAY RESPOND AS CHAIR TO THE NOTIFIED ENTITY THIS USUALLY FALLS COLLABORATION ACROSS THE HOUSES -- AT INCLUDES ADMINISTRATION AND INFORMING THE RESPONSE COMMITTEE STAFF ALSO SEND COPIES OF ANY LETTERS THAT THE CHAIR SINCE THE ALL COMMITTEE MEMBERS SO YOU ARE INFORMED. AND OUT -- REEMPHASIZE THAT THE LETTERS COME THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE YEAR. IT SEEMS PRIMARILY THROUGH INTO A DURING THE INTERIM I'M JUST SAYING BUT THEY DO GO TO YOUR OFFICE EVEN IF YOU DON'T SEE THEM ON A REGULAR BASIS. THE SECOND GOP SEE RESPONSIBILITY I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS THAT WE RECEIVING REVIEW ANYWHERE FROM TWO TO THREE HUNDRED REPORTS FROM AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF STATE PROGRAMS. COMMITTEE STAFF DISTRIBUTE THESE REPORTS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR TO ALL DEAL BC MEMBER OFFICES AND IN RECENT YEARS WITH -- OUR NEW STAFF TO THE COMMITTEE THEY'VE BEEN VERSUS PAPER VERSION. TWO EXAMPLES OF THESE REPORTS WOULD BE AN REPORTS ON THE STATUS OF A MAJOR AUTOMATION PROJECT OR MONTHLY REPORTS FROM THE DMV ON THEIR RECENT WAIT TIMES THOSE ARE JUST TWO EXAMPLES. OF THE TWO TO THREE HUNDRED PORTS THAT COM. THE FINAL RESPONSIBILITY THE IBC IS AGAIN THAT WE SELECT THE LEAD TO ALICE AND OVERSEE THE LA L.. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER AFTER A BIPARTISAN BICAMERAL SEARCH THIS FALL THE DEAL BE SEE APPOINTED MISTER PECK TO THIS POSITION IN JANUARY. BEFORE WE MOVE INTO THE SECOND PART OF OUR HEARING IN WHICH WE WILL TALK FURTHER ABOUT THE GOP SEES ROLE WITH RESPECT TO THE LA OUT. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ABOUT THE GOP SEES FUNCTIONS ITSELF. SEEING NONE WE'RE GOING TO MOVE INTO THE SECOND PART ON AND I'D LIKE TO INVITE. MISTER PANIC TO COME FORWARD AND JOIN US AT THE TABLE. AGAIN WOULD PUT. TODAY'S CONVERSATION IN A LITTLE BIT MORE CONTEXT MR TING ALLUDED TO IT DURING THE SEARCH THIS FALL WITH THE SUBCOMMITTEE HAD EXTENSIVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE LA ALL ITS RESOURCES. AND HOW THE JAIL BC CAN BEST CARRY OUT OUR DUTIES TO OVERSEE THE LA OUT. WHEN THE RESULT OF OUR DIALOGUE WITH THE BIPARTISAN INTRODUCTION OF ACA ELEVEN WHICH WOULD REMOVE THE LA L. FROM THE LEGISLATURE SPENDING CAP UNDER PROP ONE FORTY AND POTENTIALLY ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN THE OFFICE? WITH THAT CAP IN PLACE THE LA L. STAFF HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO GROW IN TANDEM WITH THE GROWTH IN THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE STATE BUDGET. AND SO AS WE TALK ABOUT OUR EXPECTATIONS OF THIS INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY. NONPARTISAN THINK TANK WE HAVE A RESPONSE REALLY RESOURCE THEY HAVE THE STAFF IN PLACE TO DO THE KIND OF JOB WE FIND THE VALUE. AGAIN ANOTHER RESULT OF OUR DIALOGUE WAS A COMMITMENT TO CONVNE THIS HEARING ULTIMATELY WE WANT THIS DISCUSSION TO HELP INSURE THAT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THERE IS A PROCESS FOR ENSURING AN ONGOING ALIGNMENT. BETWEEN WHAT THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS FROM THE ALEJO AND HOW THE LA -- PRIORITIZES ITS RESOURCES WITH THAT I'LL ASK MISTER PETTIT OFFERS PRESENTATION TO BEGIN THIS PART OF THE HEARING. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR JOINING US AND WELCOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY. IT'S A REAL HONOR FOR ME TO PARTICIPATE IN THE HEARING AND SO AS A WE THE CHAIR JUST SAID MY NAME IS GAY PADDICK. AND I AM THE RECENTLY APPOINTED LEGISLATIVE ANALYST. I STARTED ABOUT SIX WEEKS AGO. AND SO IF YOU DON'T MIND I'D LIKE TO JUST DIG KNOWLEDGE THAT MY COLLEAGUES THE DEPUTY LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S HAVE ACCOMPANIED ME OVER HERE TODAY IN OUR ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER. AND I HAD ALSO -- IT'S OKAY LIKE TO MENTION THAT THEY'VE REALLY THEY'VE GONE ABOVE AND BEYOND IN EQUITY ME WITH THE OFFICE. AND THE NUANCES OF OUR ROLE AND I HAVE REALLY -- AND MADE IT A SMOOTHER TRANSITION THAN YOU COULD IMAGINE IN PARTICULAR I WANTED TO THANK CAROLINE CHU WHO SERVED IN THE POSITION OF THE INTERIM LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S BEFORE I ARRIVED ON THE SCENE SO -- THANK YOU TO HER. BUT SO WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IF IT'S OKAY IS GO THROUGH AN OVERVIEW OF OUR OFFICE INCLUDING A BRIEF HISTORY WHICH YOU ACTUALLY ALLUDED TO ALREADY. MADAM CHAIR AND THEN DESCRIBE FOR YOU ARE -- SUMMARY A SUMMARY OF OUR MAIN FUNCTIONS HOW WE HAVE EXECUTED ON THOSE. HIGHLIGHT OUR STAFFING LEVELS AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AND THEN DESCRIBE FOR YOU THE AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT AS MY PRIORITIES FOR THE COMING TWELVE MY SO WE CAN TRACE THE HISTORY OF OUR OFFICE BACK TO THE NINETEEN THIRTIES. A TIME WHEN THE THE STATE BUDGET WAS BECOMING MORE COMPLEX. AND IN THAT. THE LEGISLATURE HAD BECOME CONCERNED ABOUT THE BALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN IT IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. AND SO AS THE CHAIR MENTIONED THE OP THE THE LEGISLATURE PASSED LEGISLATION THAT WOULD ESTABLISH WHAT WAS THEN CALLED THE LEGISLATIVE AUDITORS OFFICE IN. NINETEEN FORTY ONE ONLY TO HAVE IT VETOED BY THEN GOVERNOR COLBERT WILSON. BUT THE LEGISLATURE WAS UNDETERRED AND STE WHEN I HAD AN ESTABLISHED OUR OFFICE THROUGH A JOINT RULE BETWEEN THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY. AND I DO THINK IT IS A YOU KNOW TESTAMENT TO THE VALUE OF THE FUNCTION OF OUR OFFICE THAT NOW ALL FIFTY STATES HAVE SOME VERSION OF THE LEGISLATIVE FISCAL OFFICE. AND AS MR TING MENTIONED THAT THE OFFICE IS THE MODEL THAT THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET BUDGET OFFICE WAS -- BASED ON SO OUR OUR MISSION AS A PURSUANT TO THE JOINT RULE THAT WE WERE ESTABLISHED UNDER IS TO ASCERTAIN FACTS AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE ON MATTERS CONCERNING THE BUDGET. NEWS AND EXPENDITURES THE ORGANIZATION AND FUNCTIONS OF STATE GOVERNMENT ITS DEPARTMENTS SUBDIVISIONS AND AGENCIES SO I THINK A SUMMARY WAY TO SAY THAT IS JUST THAT WE HAVE A BROAD BUT PHYSICALLY ORIENTED MANDATE. WE ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE JAIL BC. AND ONE OF THE MAIN WAYS THAT YOU EXPRESSED THAT IS THROUGH YOUR APPOINTMENT OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST IN THIS CASE ME AND I SERVE AT THE PLEASURE OF THE COMMITTEE. WE VERY MUCH ARE A CREATION OF THE LEGISLATURE FOR THE LEGISLATURE. SO MOVING ON TO THE SECOND PAGE WHICH I SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED I HOPE YOU HAVE A COPY OF THE HAND. THERE. AND ON THIS PAGE I THOUGHT I'D. BRIEFLY DESCRIBE TO OUR RESPNSIBILITIES ARE MAIN RESPONSIBILITIES I THINK YOU CAN PUT THEM INTO THREE BROAD CATEGORIES ONE IS OUR BUDGET ANALYSIS THE SECOND IS. OUR OTHER LEGISLATIVE WORK AND THEN THIRD OUR OUR DUTIES AS IT -- WITH REGARD TO BUDGET MEASURES AND ANALYSIS. SO. HONOR BUDGET RESPONSIBILITIES ROLL IS NOTABLE FOR TRADITIONALLY INITIATING THE ANNUAL -- THIS BUDGET CYCLE WHEN WE RELEASE OUR FISCAL FORECAST EACH NOVEMBER. AND THEN OUR WORK ON THE BUDGET CONTINUES IN JANUARY FOLLOWING RELEASE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL. ABOUT WHICH WE PROVIDE AN ASSESSMENT MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS PROVIDE ALTERNATIVE CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE AND M. PROVIDE CAN ALTERNATIVE CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE. WE ALSO HAVE A AN IMPORTANT CONTROL FUNCTION WITH REGARD TO THE BUDGET. WE RUN INDEPENDENT CALCULATIONS OF THE VARIOUS STATE FUNDING FORMULAS AND WE ANALYZE THE ADMINISTRATION'S CALCULATIONS IN THIS AREA. AND AS YOU JUST DISCUSSED IN THE FIRST -- PORTION OF THIS HEARING WE ALSO REVIEW ALL OF THE SPENDING REQUEST TO COME OVER FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AFTER THE BUDGET HAS BEEN ENACTED. MOVING TO OUR OTHER LEGISLATIVE RESPONSIBILITIES I WILL HIGHLIGHT JUST A COUPLE OF THESE ITEMS FOR YOU. I CAN SEE ALREADY FROM MY TIME IN THE OFFICE THAT ONE OF OUR MAIN FOCUSES IS RESPONDING TO QUESTIONS AND REQUESTS THAT COME IN FROM THE MEMBERS AND THEIR STAFFS [inaudible] SO. YOU KNOW THESE CAN RANGE FROM LESS FORMAL PHONE CALLS AND EMAILS WHERE -- STAFF MEMBERS TYPICALLY WILL CALL UP WITH A QUESTION -- SEEKING CERTAIN DATA AND OUR STAFF WILL. SEE TO TRY TO PROVIDE THAT TO THEM -- BUT OTHER TIMES THE REQUESTS ARE MORE FORMAL AND COME AT IN A LETTER FROM THE FROM MEMBERS THEMSELVES ASKING US TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF SOME POLICY PROPOSAL THAT THEY'RE CONSIDERING. AND SO THEN THE OTHER ONE I WANTED TO JUST MENTION HERE IS THE FOURTH BULLET POINT IN THIS CATEGORY WHERE IT SAYS STUDY NEW POLICY IDEAS. SO THIS IS REALLY WHERE WE WOULD INITIATE AT OUR OWN DISCRETION TAKING A DEEPER LOOK AT A CERTAIN POLICY ISSUE OR A PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED IN THE COURSE OF DOING OUR OTHER WORK. NOW HOPEFULLY IN EVEN ALLUDED TO IT ALREADY BUT HOPEFULLY IN MY GOAL IS FOR THIS TO BE. RELEVANT TO YOU. HELLO ALIGNED WITH THE NEEDS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND TIMELY SO FOR EXAMPLE IN SEPTEMBER WE RELEASED A REPORT CALLED -- IMPROVING FORESTRY MANAGEMENT NOW THAT WAS DONE IN YOU KNOW IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE DEVASTATING WILDFIRES THAT IT STRUCK THE STATE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS -- SO THEN YOU KNOW MOVING TO THE FINAL CATEGORY ON THIS PAGE IT IS OUR BALLOT RESPONSIBILITIES. THIS IS A DUTY OF OURS PURSUANT TO THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT OF NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR I THINK THIS ONE IS INTERESTING BECAUSE OF ALL OF OUR RESPONSIBILITIES. THIS IS ONE WHERE WE ARE NOT EXPLICITLY SERVING THE LEGISLATURE RATHER WERE SERVING THE ONE OF THE OTHER MAJOR POLICY MAKING BODIES IN THE STATE THE VOTERS THEMSELVES. SO UNDER THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT OF NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR WE ARE CHARGED WITH. PROVIDING AN IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF VOTER INITIATIVES AND AND WHEN THEY MAKE IT TO THE BALLOT. WE PROVIDE A SUMMARY ANALYSIS. OF THE ANALYSIS IS IT A FISCAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT SO WHAT IS THE FISCAL IMPACT OF THE INITIATIVE ON US ON THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND ALSO A SUMMARY WRITTEN IN PLAIN LANGUAGE THAT VOTERS CAN UNDERSTAND OF WHAT IT YES OR NO VOTE MIGHT MEAN IN THAT CASE. OKAY SO MOVING TO PAGE. THREE HERE IS THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS SLIDE IS REALLY THIS IS HOW WE DELIVER ON THE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT I JUST MENTIONED ON THE PREVIOUS PAGE. WE DELIVER IN TWO MAIN WAYS PULL THROUGH A WRITTEN PRODUCTS BUT THEN ALSO IN OUR OTHER TYPES OF SUPPORT FOR THE LEGISLATURE FEES THE OTHER TYPES WHICH I'LL JUST MENTION HERE QUICKLY. ARE LISTED AT THE BOTTOM BUT THEIR YOU KNOW TO PROVIDING A TESTIMONY THAT HEARINGS. SUPPORTING YOUR STAFF'S AS YOU DEVELOP THE AS THEY DEVELOP THE AGENDA IS FOR THE HEARINGS THROUGHOUT THE BUDGET CYCLE. AND JUST PROVIDING A GENERAL RESOURCE TO YOU THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AT ANY POINT WE ALSO FIELD AND RESPOND TO QUESTIONS FROM OTHER STAKEHOLDERS IN THE LEGISLATIVE AND BUDGET PROCESS AND WE THINK OF THAT IS HOPEFULLY A SERVICE TO YOU. AS WELL. UP ABOVE I HAVE PROVIDED A TABLE TO USE THAT TALLIES THE KEPT DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF THE WRITTEN PRODUCTS THAT OUR OFFICE HAS PRODUCED OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. I WOULD LIKE TO DRY YOUR ATTENTION TO THE FOOTNOTE AND THE TOP ONE IN PARTICULAR. THIS IS -- AS THE CHAIR MENTIONED WE WOULD RESPOND. TO SOME OF THE REQUESTS -- FORWARD SPENDING AUTHORITY OUTSIDE OF THE BUDGET PROCESS THROUGH -- THAT COME IN THROUGH THESE BUDGET NOTIFICATION LETTERS. BUT WE REALLY ONLY GOING TO RAISE. A FLAG OR A POINTED OUT TO YOU AND IT WITH A WRITTEN RESPONSE IN TIMES AND WE THINK THAT THE REQUEST IS INCONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS LEGISLATIVE ACTION OR THERE'S SOMETHING QUESTIONABLE ABOUT THE TIMING OF IT. MEANING THIS SEEMS LIKE IT COULD BE SO WITH DURING THE REGULAR BUDGET PROCESS SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SO -- THAT'S I JUST WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT ANOTHER OBSERVATION ABOUT THIS TABLE IS WHAT IF YOU SAW THESE NUMBERS OVER TIME OVER LONGER THAN JUST A TWO YEAR PERIOD I THINK WHAT YOU SEE IS WERE USING MORE AND MORE. OUR ECONOMY AND TAX BLOG AND OTHER WEB POSTINGS. SO I THINK THE THE TREND WILL BE AND I WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE IN THIS DIRECTION. PROVIDING SORT OF A REAL TIME ANALYSIS OF THE PERFORMANCE OF KEY ASPECTS OF THE STATE BUDGET REVENUE COLLECTIONS -- EXPENDITURE TRENDS. AND I THINK THIS PLATFORM IS PROBABLY A GOOD WAY TO DO THAT IN AN EFFICIENT MANNER. AND THEN THE LAST THING I'LL SPECIFICALLY MENTION ABOUT THIS PAGE IS TO THE ONE CALLED OTHER REPORTS. NOW THIS IS WHERE. THE THE REPORTS THAT WE DECIDE WITHIN THE OFFICE WARRANT SENATE DID SOME SOME ISSUE WARRANTS ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IN THAT WE SHOULD RIGHTS READ A REPORT ABOUT IT. AND SO YOU CAN SEE I WANTED TO PROVIDE THIS TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF ALL OF OUR WRITTEN PRODUCTS. A LITTLE BIT OF A FEEL. FOR WHAT THE MAGNITUDE OF EACH OF THESE CATEGORIES IS AND SO HOPEFULLY THAT'S HELPFUL. OKAY SO MOVING TO THE FOURTH PAGE. THIS SLIDE IS DESCRIPTION OF OUR PERSONNEL AND MAY BE OF INTEREST TO YOU. CURRENTLY THE OFFICE HAS FORTY ONE ANALYST WHICH INCLUDES THE FOR DEPUTY ANALYSTS AND WE ALSO HAVE THREE MANAGING PRINCIPAL ANALYST. THE OFFICE IS ORGANIZED INTO FOUR SECTIONS EACH SECTION MANAGED BY ONE OF THE DEPUTIES. AND THE SECTIONS A LINE WITH THE KEY AREAS OF THE STATE BUDGET SO EDUCATION. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES STATE AND LOCAL FINANCE. AND THE A SECTION THAT COVERS THE CORRECTIONS TRANSPORTATION AND ENVIRONMENT. I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT AFTER HAVING BEEN THERE FOR YOU KNOW THE SIX WEEKS. I CAN TELL ALREADY THAT THERE'S A VERY BIG EMPHASIS PUT ON BRINGING NEW STAFF AND THE YOUNGER NINOS LESS TENURED ANALYSTS. INTO A POSITION WHERE THEY ON THE AREAS OF THE BUDGET THAT THEY COVER. THERE'S A VERY. HIGH CAN SAY COMPARED WITH MY PREVIOUS PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE THEY HAVE A VERY ROBUST ONBOARDING PROCESS AND I WAS VERY PLEASED TO SEE THAT I THINK IT. SERVES YOU WELL I HOPE. A AND THEN ON THE LAST PAGE I THOUGHT I WOULD JUST HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU A COUPLE OF MY TOP PRIORITIES FOR THIS FIRST TWELVE MONTHS OR SO. I THINK THAT YOU MIGHT FIND THAT THERE'S SOME ALIGNMENT WITH SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT -- HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE OPENING REMARKS HERE. BECAUSE THE FIRST ONE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS EXPAND OUR MEMBER AND STAFF COMMUNICATIONS. NOW FOR ME WHAT THIS MEANS IS IN THE FIRST PHASE REALLY JUST SETTING UP OUTREACH MEETINGS TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT I'VE MET EACH OF YOU AND OTHER LEGISLATORS. AND SOME OF YOUR STAFF MEMBERS. AND WHILE I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT I THINK THERE ISN'T A RESPONSIBILITY. OF THE PERSON IN MY SEAT TO NOT JUST ESTABLISH THOSE RELATIONSHIPS BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ROBUST AN ON GOING. SO THAT'S JUST SORT OF THEFIRST PHASE AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A A DIALOGUE WITH YOU IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY. AND THE WAY THE ONE IMPORT IT WOULD BE -- EXPERIENCED I THINK IS THROUGH THE SECOND BULLET POINT HERE WHICH IS. TO INCREASE OUR OUT REACH PARTICULARLY DURING THE PHASE WHEN WE ARE DEVELOPING A RESEARCH AGENDA SO I'VE MENTIONED A COUPLE TIMES THROUGHOUT THIS THE PART ABOUT WHERE WE HAVE SOME REPORTS THAT WE DO ON A SELF INITIATED BASIS. I WILL MAKE IT A PRIORITY OF MY TENURE TO ENSURE THAT. THOSE KIND OF RESEARCH REPORTS ARE. RELEVANT TO THE LEGISLATURE THERE ARE TIMELY AND IMPORTANT TO CALIFORNIA AND SO THAT'S JUST ONE OF MY TOP PRIORITIES AND I THINK WE'RE GOING -- TO KIND OF DO THAT BY HOPEFULLY BRINGING OVER. THE DEPUTIES ALONG WITH ME TO ENGAGE IN A DISCUSSION SOME BRAINSTORMING SESSIONS IF YOU WILL JUST TO HAVE. SO THE YOU HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT FOCUSING ON AND HEAR FROM YOU WHAT YOUR PRIORITIES ARE DIRECTLY. ALTHOUGH I WOULD SAY AS AN ASIDE I CAN TELL THAT OUR OUR STAFF MEMBERS DO SEEM TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME TRYING TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU WHAT. YOU ARE FOCUSING ON THE OTHER THIRD ONE HERE I WANTED TO MENTION THAT I A HAVE. REALIZED THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR ME AND ALL OF ORGANIZATIONS BUT IN MY MY JOB ONE THING I WOULD LIKE TO DO. IS SPEND TIME THIS YEAR TAKING A CLOSE LOOK AT THE BASICALLY THE LOOK AND FEEL OF OUR WORK PRODUCTS. AND ALSO OUR WEBSITE -- IN THIS DAY AND AGE THE METHODS OF COMMUNICATION CHANGE QUICKLY AND WE ARE IN CALIFORNIA AFTER ALL THE THE HOME OF THE HIGH TECH SECTOR SO IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO COMMUNICATE IN MODERN METHODS AND THE AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DELIVERING OUR MESSAGE IN A WAY THAT. PEOPLE RECEIVE INFORMATION AND ANALYSIS IN THIS DAY AND AGE. SO THEN THE LAST THING I WANTED TO SAY HERE WAS JUST THAT. ANOTHER -- PRIORITY OF MINE WOULD BE TO LEVERAGE MY BACKGROUND AS A FINANCIAL ANALYST THAT COVERED THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THINK ABOUT SOME OF THOSE BIGGER PICTURE ISSUES THOSE TRENDS. THAT -- BEYOND THINKING OF DEMOGRAPHIC SOCIO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS MACRO ECONOMIC TRENDS AND HOW DO THOSE. DRIVES CALIFORNIA'S REVENUES AND THERE AND IT'S EXPENDITURES TO TRY TO HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT THE STATE'S LONGER TERM FISCAL TRAJECTORY IS. BOTH IF WE DO CERTAIN THINGS AND IF WE DON'T DO CERTAIN THINGS SO. IT IS THIS ONE IS -- WOULD BE SORT OF A AN IDEA THAT COULD ACCOMPANY BASICALLY ARE. CURRENTLY -- OUR OUR CURRENT FISCAL FORECAST THAT WE PRODUCE EACH NOEMBER. WOULD BE KIND OF TAKING A STEP BACK AND LOOKING AT THE BIGGER PICTURE. SO THAT'S THE OVERVIEW AND WITH THAT I AM HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS FROM YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU -- AS I DEVELOPED A LIST HERE IS MEMBERS I SEE DOCTOR PAN. LET ME KNOW -- THEY HAVE QUESTIONS BUT LET ME JUST THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION -- AS MR TING AND I JUST WHISPERED BACK AND FORTH TO EACH OTHER WE FEEL HEARD -- IN TERMS OF SOME OF OUR INITIAL -- OUT WE CAN CONVERSATION WITH YOU BUT VERSUS YOU KNOW WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE ISSUE OF RESOURCES ARE THE SUBCOMMITTEE DID IN. AND MISTER OBERNOLTE -- BROUGHT FOR HIS PERSPECTIVE ABOUT WHAT NEEDED TO BE CHANGED IN WHICH IS MANIFESTED ACA. ELEVEN BUT WHAT STRIKES ME SITTING HERE ON BE REMINDED OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE LA. LA JOH ARE THE BALLOT MEASURE RESPONSIBILITIES AND WHEN WE CONSIDER THE CONSISTENT INCREASE IN THE SHEER VOLUME THE SHEER NUMBER OF BALLOT MEASURES THAT ARE REFLECTED ON LITERALLY THROUGHOUT. EVERY. ELECTION CYCLE I'M STRUCK THAT THAT HASN'T BEEN TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION WITH A IT'S A CONSIDERATION WITH REGARD TO RESOURCES. YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT OF NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR ACKNOWLEDGING THAT. I'M SURE THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT OF NINETEEN SEVENTY THE FOUR COULDN'T IMAGINE THAT IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE WOULD -- BE GOVERNED QUITE TO THE DEGREE THAT WE ARE -- THROUGH REFERENDUM SO THAT'S A CONCERN PARTICULARLY WHEN WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOUSAY THAT YOU'VE GOT AN OFFICE OF FORTY ONE I WAS TRYING TO LOOK UP IN THE BUDGET RIGHT QUICK TO TO GET THE NUMBER. IN A SENSE OF THE NUMBER AND APARTMENT FIND OVERALL NUMBER BUT JUST AS A COMPARISON IN FINANCE THEY HAVE THIRTY SEVEN IN MANAGEMENT ALONE. AND SO I'LL GET YOU THE FULL NUMBER AND IT'S NOT THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT A FIFTEEN PER FTE COMPARISONS BUT JUST WHEN WE CONSIDER. THE SCOPE OF WORK BUT THE LA -- GAUGE THE IN -- THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE FOR A C. ELEVEN AND WE'RE GOING TO DO ALL THAT WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT ARE INDEPENDENT THINK TANK. IS APPROPRIATELY RESOURCE -- WE'LL START WITH DOCTOR PAIR AUSTIN'S. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND I GUESS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I WANTED TO ASK INTERNET AND APPRECIATE -- YOUR THE YEAR HERE OVERVIEW AND SERVICE OUTLINING SOME OF THE WAYS YOU SEE -- THAT DO YOU WANT CHANGE IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE FACT THAT YOU ALSO FUNCTIONING THIS FINES FUNCTION FOR THE PUBLIC AS WELL AND I ALSO WONDER WHETHER. THE COST OF THAT SHOULD BE NOT COUNTED AGAINST OUR LEGISLATIVE LIMITS SINCE THIS ALTHOUGH YOU ARE PART OF LEGISLATURE IN TERMS OF YOUR FUNDING -- THAT BECAUSE THIS IS A SERVICE OF THE PUBLIC BUT THAT'S A WHOLE NOTHER CONVERSATION -- THE BUT WHY DID WANT TO ASK YOU WAS IS THAT -- WHEN THINGS THAT AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE SERVE YOUR STAFF IS HEARD FROM ME AND BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE I THINK US OUR MONEY JUST STEPPED OUT ALSO -- THE SHARES WITH ME HAS SHARED AT A BUDGET ISSUES OR FINANCIAL ISSUES WHETHER THINGS THAT WE WANT TO LOOK AT IS. OFTENTIMES THERE'S TRADE OFFS RIGHT AND SO. A PROGRAM WOULD BE BROUGHT BEFORE US AND FINANCE WILL SAY WILL COST A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY BECAUSE THE ALL BOB CERTAIN ABOUT STAFF AND SO FORTH BUT THERE IS RESEARCH DATA WILLING TO SET A VERY HIGH BAR FOR THAT IT'S NOT JUST A QUITE THINK IT'S GOING TO BUT IF. YOU HAVE EVIDENCE BASED RESEARCH CLASS -- YOU KNOW OF STUDIES -- SPECIALLY -- EVEN CLINICAL TRIALS ARE THIS INTERVENTION WOULD ACTUALLY DO SO EXPENDITURES LATER ON THAT THAT SHOULD BE REFLECTED IN OUR ANALYSIS AND I BASICALLY BRING THIS UP FOR L. A. L. BECAUSE FINANCE WORKS FOR THE GOVERNOR SO THAT'S THE GOVERNOR WILL HAVE TO GIVE DIRECTION BUT AS OUR LA YELLOW. I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT KIND OF CAPACITY IN THE LA -- SO AND AND FRANKLY I TELL THE ADVOCATES WILL BRING THE EVIDENCE TO THE ALEJO RIGHT SO MY REALIZE YOU'RE NOT YOU KNOW YOU'RE A LITTLE SHORT STAFFED AND SO BRING WHAT YOU HAVE. BUT I DO HOPE THAT THE LA -- CAN LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE. IN ADDITION TO HOPEFULLY BE I'LL DO A LITTLE OF YOUR OWN RESEARCH BUT BUT AT LEAST LOOK AT AND SAY WELL ACTUALLY IN THE OUT YEARS WE SHOULD BE SCORING SAVINGS. NOT JUST COSTS RIGHT BECAUSE EASIEST CORE LIKE OF THIS GUN REQUIRE EX NUMBER PEOPLE AT CETERA AND DAYS AFTER IAN THAT'S MONEY OUT BUT WHEN YOU HAVE RESEARCH THAT SHOWS WELL ACTUALLY PUTTING THOSE INVESTMENTS AND LEAD TO SAVINGS AND AGAIN I'M WILLING TO SET A PRETTY HIGH BAR FOR THAT. EVIDENCE RIGHT BUT WHEN THEY DOES WHAT IT DOES WE SHOULD REFLECT THAT IN THE OUT YEARS THE SAVINGS AND SO CAN YOU SPEAK. TO CREATING THAT KIND OF CAPACITY WITHIN THE LA L. TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. WELL THE SENATOR PAN YES THIS IS -- ACTUALLY AN AREA THAT I THINK WOULD. FALL WITHIN. ONE OF THE FOR POINTS THAT I BROUGHT UP AT THE END OF MY PRESENTATION AS ONE OF THE PRIORITIES THAT I HAVE WHICH IS. TO BUILD OUT THIS LONG RUN OUTLOOK TO EXAMINE FUTURE FUTURE BUDGET PRESSURES EMERGING ISSUES. MY VIEW IS THAT THAT TYPE OF IF COULD BE BUILT INTO SOMETHING THAT LOOKS AT TRENDS OVER THE LONGER TERM. AND YOU COULD ENVISIONED WE HAD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS JUST LAST WEEK INTERNALLY YOU CAN ENVISION. POTENTIALLY DOING SOME KIND OF SCENARIO ANALYSIS OF IF WE DON'T MAKE THIS INTERVENTION IF WE DO MAKE THIS INTERVENTION. AND I I DO THINK THERE'S POTENTIAL TO DO THAT AND YOU KNOW. ANYBODY THAT HAS EVER YOU KNOW HAD A HOME. YOU KNOW THAT SOMETIMES. MONEY YOU SPEND TODAY MAY SEEM LIKE A LOT BUT IT'S GOING TO COST A LOT MORE IF YOU WAIT TEN YEARS TO DEAL WITH WHATEVER LEAKY ROOF FOR PROBLEM THE HAVE SO. I MEAN I I DEFINITELY TAKE YOUR POINT AND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WILL -- BE THINKING ABOUT OKAY -- I I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT -- TOO OFTEN WHEN WE LOOK AT ISSUES WE SIMPLY SAY WELL THIS IS THE UP FRONT COSTS AND WE NEED TO STAFF ON THE ON GOING BASIS IS THERE NOT. BUT THERE'S A REASON WHY WE'RE INVESTING IN THAT AND AND FRANKLY YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE EVEN ON THE I. T. PROJECTS I'VE CHALLENGE PEOPLE SAID OKAY FINE WE'RE MAKING THIS INVESTMENT IT OF BAY L. CREW CALL THE SERVICE AT CENTER AND THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT IT BY THE WAY. BUT LIKE IS IT GOING TO MAKE US MORE FISH THESE TASKS THAT IS SO SO I THINK THERE'S A WIDE VARIETY OF RANGE OF THINGS -- I THINK A LOT HUMAN SERVICES AND HEALTH CARE STUFF AS WELL -- WESHOULD BE LOOKING AT THAT BECAUSE I WE SAID THAT ONE AWAY AS WE PREPARE FOR A FUTURE DOWNTURN IS ONE WAY IS OF COURSE WE PUT SOME MONEY ASIDE FOR THAT BUT THE OTHER THING IS IS THAT WE MAKE THE INVESTMENTS WHILE WE HAVE THE FUNDS. THAT LEAD TO THE KIND OF CHANGES IN THE WAY WE DO THINGS. THAT THEN MAKE US MORE RESILIENT THAT ALSO SEE THIS MY IN THE FUTURE IN FACT I'D ARGUE THAT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE PAYING FOR NOW AS A RESULT OF DECISIONS SHORT TERM DECISIONS ARE MADE. DURING PREVIOUS DOWNTURNS THAT WE'RE NOT PAYING THE PRICE FOR NOW. AS WELL AND SO -- ANDSO WE ARE SPENDING MORE NOW THAT WE COULD IT COULD HAVE BECAUSE PEOPLE MADE REALLY SHORT TERM DECISIONS BACK THEN. THEY HAD A YOUNG DEFICIT THE DEAL AT SITE AND ARE STAND THE CHALLENGE AT THAT TIME. BUT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THESE THINGS THAT WE CAN MAKE THEBEST POSSIBLE DECISIONS I APPRECIATE YOU. YOUR DESIRE TO BUILD THAT CAPACITY IN THE L. L. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR PAN BEFORE I MOVE OVER TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEAM WHO WILL BE FOLLOWED BY SENATOR SKINNER WE GOT THE DATA THIS IS JUST FASCINATING OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THEY HAVE A STATE AUDITS UNIT SO THEY HAVE MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS. MUCH LIKE THE LA L. BEYOND JUST THE BUDGET BUT THEY HAVE TEN TIMES THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES AND LA L.. IN THE CURRENT BUDGET THERE ARE FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT STAFF WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I'M NOT THROWING SHADE FINANCE. I'M JUST SAYING IT GIVES US A CONTACT US ALL IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE WE SUPPORT THIS BILL MAKING SURE WE GET THE RESOURCES TO THE TABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR ENTITY. IS A PROPERLY RESOURCE TO DO THE JOB THAT WE EXPECTED THEM AND THAT THEY ARE THAT THE STATUTE REQUIRES OF THEM. TEN TIMES THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES MR TING. THE FAQ MARRIAGE I THINK IT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT ESPECIALLY WHEN WE REVIEW THAT THE IMPETUS. FOR THE CREATION OF THIS OFFICE WAS TO PROVIDE THE ACCOUNT AWAY COUNTER BALANCE TO THE PART OF JOB OF THAT AT THIS POINT -- SO JUST JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS CAN CAN YOU DESCRIBE TO ME THAT PROCESS -- THAT MEMBERS AND STAFF REQUEST INFORMATION BECAUSE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS NEVER BEEN COMPLETELY CLEAR TO ME OR I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A FORMAL. FORMAL PROCESS WAS A TO SORT OF INFORMAL DOESN'T LIKE PEOPLE PASS NOTES IN THE HALL IS IT -- JUST SORT OF SHE TOLD PEOPLE SEND INFORMATION BY CARRIER PIGEON I DON'T KNOW. HOW THAT? HOW HOW THE I THE THE ONLY REASON I BASS I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO GET ANY OF MY REQUEST? NO IMPLEMENTED SO SO I HAVE COMPLETE INTEREST IN REALLY. BUT I'VE HAD MY REQUEST MET YEAH CLEARLY THAT I I'LL CALL ALL MY METHODS HAVE BEEN. COULD YOU USE. I I'M I'M GONNA USE AL BY THE FUTURE -- SO. I'M. SORRY TO HEAR THAT WE WE WILL AND FROM WHAT FROM WHAT I SEE THIS IS A PRIORITY AREA WAS IN THE OFFICE AND THE WAY THAT WE SEE THAT I'VE SEEN THAT WE RECEIVE THESE REQUESTS. DOES VARY WIDELY SO SOME OF THEM ARE MALES ARE PHONE CALLS SUBMITTING A QUESTION. THERE ARE TIMES WHEN A QUESTION WILL COME IN. WELL LET ME JUST SAY THAN THE OTHER ONES ARE THE MORE FORMAL ONES THAT ARE ASKING US TO KIND OF THE VALUE WAIT SOME POTENTIAL CHANGE. THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHERE I THINK WE RECEIVE QUESTIONS THAT REQUIRE FOLLOW UP ON OUR PART BECAUSE THE DATA MIGHT NOT BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER. THE QUESTION IN THE WAY THAT IT WAS ASKED AND SO WE TRY TO FOLLOW UP WITH SORT OF LIKE A SCOPING MEETING WHERE WE DISCUSSED WITH WHOEVER REQUESTED IT TO TRY TO SCOPE IT DOWN TO SOMETHING WE CAN. WE CAN DO BUT IS ALSO STILL USEFUL TO THE REQUESTER. THE OTHER THERE IS THE MANAGEMENT SIDE OF THIS BECAUSE WHILE WE TRACK THESE MEMBER REQUESTS AND YOU CAN SEE THEM ON ON THE TABLE HERE THERE'S YOU KNOW OVER A HUNDRED OF THEM. THESE ARE ONLY THE ONES THAT. TOOK YOU KNOW TWO OR THREE DAYS OR MORE FOR US TO WORK ON THERE ARE MANY MANY THAT WE RECEIVE THAT ARE RESPONDED TO WITHIN A COUPLE OF HOURS. OR SHORTER TIME FRAME. AND SO WHILE I'M NOT SAYING THAT TO PAT OURSELVES ON THE BACK AND SAYING THAT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE DOING A SUFFICIENTLY GOOD JOB JUST TRACKING THE QUESTIONS THAT COME IN AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM. HOW WE RESPOND AND SO I KNOW IN SOME SENSE IT ALMOST CREATES MORE WORK GREAT FOR THE STAFF LIKE NOT ONLY DO I HAVE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION AFTER DOCUMENT ANSWERING THE QUESTION AND SO? I'M THINKING ABOUT WAYS KIND OF EVALUATING OR WORK PROCESS WITH OUR WITH OUR STAFF AND MANAGEMENT -- WAYS. TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS TO RECORD THE QUESTIONS THAT COME IN IN FACT. MR SYDNEY ONE OF THE FORMER DEPUTY TO MY ATTENTION A VERY GOOD IDEA OF EVEN DEVELOPING AN APP WHERE YOUR TECHNOLOGY ORIENTED STAFF MEMBERS COULD GO ON AND AND SUBMIT A REQUEST AND HOPEFULLY THEN IT WOULD BE RECORDED. AND AND FUNNELED TO THE YOU KNOW THE PROPER SECTION SO. IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A WORK IN PROGRESS I THINK BUT YOU KNOW THAT THAT IS MY UNDERSTANDING OF HOW WE DO IT THIS TIME. SO I THINK  WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU. TO DEVELOP A FORMALIZED PROCESS I THINK -- QUITE OFTEN -- THINGS ARE DONE INFORMALLY IN THIS BUILDING. AND I THINK IT'S TO OUR TO OUR DETRIMENT SO IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE IN MY OPINION KIND OF PROFESSIONAL EYES -- I KNOW THAT THIS IS MY MY SEVEN I'M SORRY MY SEVENTY YEAR HERE THE FACT THAT I DON'T KNOW -- OW THAT PROCESS WORKS OR -- HOW HOW TO GO DO IT I THINK SAYS SOMETHING AND? WHAT I ALSO DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU REPORTER YOUR PC SO THAT SAYS SOMETHING -- SO I THINK THAT THEY WOULD JUST BE REALLY BEHOOVE ALL OF US ESPECIALLY AS NEW MEMBER ACTUALLY IN A WAY TOO MUCH TURN IN THIS LEGISLATURE REALLY -- LOOK FOR TO LITTLE MORE STABILITY IN THAT BUT I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL. SO -- JUST JUST ANOTHER ON SORT OF JUST KATAKANA COMMENTING YOU CAN FEEL FREE. TO THE COULD TO DISCUSS THE TWO IS. ONE OF THE THINGS -- I I REALLY DID APPRECIATE SITTING -- IN BUDGET SUB TO WHEN I WAS A MEMBER THERE IS JUST THE ANALYSIS AND THE INFORMATION THAT WAS REALLY REALLY DEVELOPED -- ONE QUESTION THAT I DID ALWAYS HAVE WAS THERE'S ALWAYS SOME SORT OF RECOMMENDATION. SOME KIND OF AT THE END AND I THINK ON RATHER THAN. YOU KNOW NOT JUST KIND OF POSE A SENSE AT THE SORT OF FOOD FOR THOUGHT AS RAT RATHER THAN HAVING A SORT OF FINAL RECOMMENDATION PERCENT THINK WHAT WOULD OFTEN BE HELPFUL. WOULD BE IT'S SORT OF A LIST OF OPTIONS ARE ABOUT IT SO I KIND OF WOULD GET I WOULD READ THE ANALYSIS TO GET TO THE CONCLUSION I BE LIKE WELL HOW DO THEY HOW THEY GET HERE. HOW DID THEY GET TO THE END? AND RIGHT RATHER THAN SAY HEY THIS IS THE ONE AND ONLY RECOMMENDATION OR ANSWER -- IT'LL BE PROBABLY MORE HELPFUL TO HAVE A VARIETY OF OPTIONS THAT WE ARE REALLY. LOOKING AT AS POLICY OPTIONS TO HELP US IN FRAMING ARE THINKING I THINK ANOTHER PART WITHIN THE BUDGET. RESPONSE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THE STAFF ARE ARE THERE AT ALL THE HEROES I SING THE SAME SAME IN THE SENATE -- I THINK IT PROBABLY WOULD. BE. GOOD FOR THE STAFF TO ALSO I THINK INTERFACE MORE FOR THAT WITH THE MEMBERS I KNOW THAT THE LA -- STACK INTERVIEW INNER -- SORT OF CONTACTS MY BUDGET. COMMITTEE STAFF QUITE OFTEN THERE DURING COSTS DIALOGUE BUT I THINK THERE THERE'S A THERE'S A MISSING. ON LINK IS REALLY TALKING TO THE MEMBERSHIP TALKING TO THE MEMBERS THE SUB CHAIRS THINGS LIKE THAT I DON'T THINK. THOSE DISCUSSIONS HAPPENED AND ANY SORT OF REGULARITIES I THINK THAT WOULD BE -- SORT OF MUCH MORE HELPFUL TO YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THINKING WELL YOU KNOW WHAT'S DRIVING SOME THAT'S I THINK OUT. SO THAT WHEN THE OPTIONS COME OUT THERE A LITTLE MORE -- IN SYNC WITH WHAT THE DIALOGUE AS WELL THANK YOU IF THE LOSER FOR VERY FAIR POINTS A HOPE THAT YOU HEARD IN SOME OF MY COMMENTS TO THAT IS A PRIORITY FOR ME. AND I DO I KNOW -- THE SOMETIMES. THE REPORTS THAT WE PRODUCE -- THAT MIGHT BE THIS MIGHT BE ONE AREA WHERE IT'S THE LOOK AND FEEL COMPONENT OF THE REPORT THAT I MENTIONED. COULD COULD HELP IN THIS WAY BECAUSE I KNOW THAT SOMETIMES THE DO DEVELOP A MENU OF ALTERNATIVE CAN OPTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER AND INCORPORATING. STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES BUT IT MAY NOT ALWAYS. BE EASILY IDENTIFIED A QUICK A QUICK WAY AND I THINK THERE COULD BE OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO SORT OF PRESENT THE INFORMATION IN A MANNER THAT STE -- WHAT I I'VE BEEN CALLING THEM ALMOST LIKE TERROR SHE YOU KNOW WE HAVE THIS LONG REPORT FOR THAT IS THERE FOR BACK UP YOUR STAFF FOR YOU WHEN YOU HAVE? TIME AND IT'S ON YOUR DESK YOU CAN LOOK AT IT LATER IN THE DAY OR SOMETHING BUT YOU MIGHT NEED JUST TO KNOW WHAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE WHAT IS LA -- THINKING ABOUT THIS AND IN THAT WAY MAYBE IT COULD HELP IN THAT REGARD OF I THINK UP ABSOLUTELY NOTHING JUST THAT THE THE FINAL POINT IS. ON THE ASSIGNMENT OF WAR REGARDING THE REPORTS THAT ARE GIVEN TO MEMBERS REQUESTS ARE PART OF THE BUDGET. I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE THAT IN SOME SOME LEVEL OF DISCUSSION OR CONSULTATION WITH JAIL BC -- BECAUSE EVERY YEAR OR I I KNOW IN THE FALL WE'RE GOING TO HEAR YOU KNOW WE CAN KIND OF PROTECT HERE ARE. A HERO HERE WE JUST SEE COMING YEAH FIVE ISSUES. THAT ARE HOT LIKE IMAGES JUST FOR EXAMPLE NOT REALLY IN THE PURVIEW OF LA -- BUT SOMETHING THAT WE'RE ALL JUST REALLY TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH THE IS ON TOP OF THE WILDFIRES IS REALLY WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. REGARDING ALL THE I'LL. I KNOW THAT THERE ARE UTILITIES COMMITTEES ARE REALLY GRAPPLING WITH THAT BUT FROM A BROADER. POINT OF VIEW THAT IT IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR EVEN THE COMMITTEES TO WAIT FOR A BILL. IT DID THIS IS RELEASING THAT THAT'S MUCH BIGGER THINKING ABOUT HOW ENERGY IS GOING TO BE PROVIDED HOW TO PROVIDE IT SAFELY. ON HOW IT'S DONE IN LINK TO JUST THAT NOT NOT JUST HIS EYES AS AN EXAMPLE THAT'S JUST AN EXAMPLE OF THEM THAT WE ARE. SORT OF RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF AND YOU KNOW REALLY THERE'S A DOES AVOID AND THINKING AND RESEARCH AND TO A POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS BUT THAT'S JUST ONE OF I WOULD SAY -- THEREFORE FIVE THINGS I THINK UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE SINGLE PAYER ISSUES HAVE BEEN SORT OF DOMINANT OF LAST COUPLE DECADES BUT THAT'S AND THAT'S REALLY BEEN. PART OF THE POLICY DISCUSSION OF LAST COUPLE YEARS AND HAS ALSO. LACKED A HEY WE HEAR SOME PURE SOME REALLY -- ACADEMIC OFF BEHIND IT WHICH I THINK THE OFFICE COULD BE EXTREMELY EXTREMELY HELPFUL WITH. SO ON THE THOSE ARE JUST A COUPLE A COUPLE THOUGHTS TO JUST SAY HEY I THINK WE WE REALLY VALUE THE OFFICE WE REALLY WOULD LOVE TO HELP WITH OFFICE BY THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE. A LITTLE MORE OF SYNC BETWEEN BETWEEN US IN THE OFFICE. UNDERSTOOD THANK YOU. REMIND ME WHAT TIME OF YEAR -- BUT I KNOW I CAN'T BE THE MIDDLE THE BUDGET ANALYSIS THAT THE OFFICE TYPICALLY DOES THESE KIND OF FORWARD THINKING. DOCUMENTS THEY TEND TO BE RELEASED -- MORE IN THE POST BUDGET PERIOD MMHM YOU KNOW MAYBE JULY THROUGH -- OCTOBER BECAUSE THEN YOU GET TO NOVEMBER AND THAT'S WHEN THE FORECAST IS COMING OUT RIGHT THERE'S ACTUALLY A SMALL WINDOW. ALTHOUGH. OF COURSE THAT GOES INTO THOSE REPORTS HAS STARTED WELL BEFORE THAT SOMETIMES IT EVEN TAKES MORE THAN A YEAR. SO THAT'S THE PHASE WHERE I I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH JAIL BC MEMBERS AND AND OTHERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S SOME. YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT EVER SURPRISED OR CUT OFF FLAT FOOTED BY WHAT WE PRODUCE AND SO I ASKED THAT JUST BECAUSE OF THAT I THINK WE SHOULD COMMIT COMMIT AS JAIL B. C. THAN TO CONVENE ANOTHER HEARING TO GO DEEPER INTO THAT CONVERSATION BECAUSE IF YOU. POLL EVERY MEMBER THE D. L. B. C. YOU WILL GET A VERY DIFFERENT LIST I'M SURE SO IF WE COULD CONVENE AS A G. L. B. C. TO HAVE THAT SPECIFIC CONVERSATION. I THINK THAT'S ONLY FAIR TO YOU AND HELPFUL TO US WE SHOULD FOLLOW UP ON THAT -- WITH REGARD TO THE REQUESTS I THINK THAT IS A GREAT IDEA TO FORMALIZE THE PROCESS. IN THE MEAN TIME -- HOW DO YOU COMMUNICATE TO OUR STAFF BECAUSE THE REQUEST COME FROM THE STAFF AND MAKING SURE THAT STAFF? KNOW WHO TO DIRECT THE REQUEST TO IS IT A SINGLE POINT OF ENTRY INTO THE ALEJO OR DO THEY SEND THE EMAIL TO THE ANALYSTS THEY KNOW WHO DOES THE WORK IN THAT AREA. I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT AS YOU DO YOUR VISITS WITH MEMBERS THAT PERHAPS YOU BRING A DIRECTOR OR SOMETHING SO THE MEMBER. UNDERSTANDS WHO TO ASK WHAT OF AND THE MEMBER STAFF ARE CLEAR ABOUT WHO TO DIRECT QUESTIONS TO IT MIGHT BE. KIND OF THAT FOUNDATIONAL AND LASTLY I WOULD SAY AGAIN. RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO TAKE IN TERMS OF THIS RELATIONSHIP. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THERE'S NOTHING CURRENTLY THAT WOULD PRECLUDE A BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIR FROM REACHING OUT IN ASKING DIRECTLY FOR A BRIEFING FROM THE ANALYSTS WHO WORKS IN A PARTICULAR AREA. SOLD OUT COMMUNICATE THAT TO MY SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIRS I HOPE YOU DO THE SAME AND SO WE CAN KICK START THAT PROCESS BY THE SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIRS -- RECOGNIZE THAT THE LA -- IS A RESOURCE THAT CAN EITHER BE A PART OF YOUR BRIEF INTERVIEW CHOOSE TO DO THAT WE CAN INITIATE THAT BY EXTENDING THE INVITATION. TO THEM AND I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW I I BROADER MEMBERSHIP OF THE LEGISLATURE'S AWARE THAT WE DO THAT BECAUSE I KNOW OUR STAFF ON CERTAIN TOPICS THEY DO DO THAT I THINK THE ISSUE THAT I THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IS THAT. TO SOME EXTENT. IT'S IT'S BEEN DONE ON AN AD HOC BASIS. YOU KNOW SOME OF THE STAFF KNOW THE TO THE PARTICULAR ANALYST IN OUR OFFICE IS RIGHT YOU KNOW THAT'S GREAT BUT I WOULD LIKE IT TO BE MORE -- WELL ESTABLISHED THREE WORDS AGREED I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT AS YOU FIGURE OUT YOUR STE INFRASTRUCTURE JUST ON AN INTERIM BASIS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT. ALL THE MEMBERS HERE AND THE STAFF WITHIN THE SOUND OF OUR VOICES HERE TODAY UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A PROCESS THAT WE COULD USE AN INTERIM -- WAY ON TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE GETTING THEIR MEMBER REQUEST TO THE RIGHT PERSON [inaudible] SERVICE SKINNER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AND ONE ECHO SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT -- BOTH THE CHAIR MADE AND ARE ASSEMBLY BUDGET YEAR -- AND WILL WELCOME MISTER TECH. DID I GET THAT ONE RIGHT DID I DO THAT CORRECTLY. OKAY THE TECH OKAY SO SEE I GOT LOCKED INTO AND I WASN'T EVEN. HEADACHE THAT'S OKAY I WILL. WRITE THAT DOWN PHONETICALLY AND NOT PUT IT ON AGAIN -- ANYWAY -- I I HAD A BIT OF A REPUTATION BECAUSE WHEN I WAS THE CHAIR OF THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO. I DID NOT CALL ON THE LA -- AS FREQUENTLY AS PREVIOUS CONFERENCE COMMITTEE CHAIRS HAD. AND I WANT TO DO IS CONVEY SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE ALREADY EXPRESSED -- REFLECT WHY I DID NOT DO SO. I VERY MUCH VALUE THE ANALYSIS THAT THE LA -- PROVIDES US BUT WHAT I IN THOSE CONTEXTS WHAT I WANT. IS ANALYSIS NOW THAT ISN'T THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT. THE OPINION OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE. ANALYZED THOSE THINGS THAT ARE NOT LEGITIMATE FOR US TO CONSIDER. BUT WHEN THIS WHEN THE ISSUE BEFORE US HASN'T REALLY BEEN ANALYZED. THEN MY ISSUE WAS I'M NOT BEING PROVIDED NECESSARILY IMPARTIAL DATA OR SOMETHING TO WAY I'M BEING GIVEN -- AN OPINION AND AGAIN THAT SOME PEOPLE MAY SAY WELL LA -- SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXPRESS AN OPINION BUT I WANT THAT BACKED BY. THAT ANALYSIS AND THERE WERE IT WAS MY EXPERIENCE IN THAT YEAR AND THE YEAR BEFORE THAT THERE WAS. A NUMBER OF SUBJECT AREAS WHERE. ELLIE -- STAFF WOULD OPINE AND I WOULD ASK IS THAT BASED ON EIGHT YOU KNOW SOME RESEARCH THAT WAS DONE OR SOME DATA THAT YOU HAVE FOR US OR I WOULD ASK VARIOUS QUESTIONS LIKE THAT. AND IT WOULD NOT BE. AND SO THAT WAS FRUSTRATING FOR ME BECAUSE IT WAS I WOULD I FELT I WAS GETTING LESS. OF THE OF WHAT THE ROLE OF THE LA -- REALLY. IS FOR US. NOW OF COURSE WEIGHING THE NUMBER ALL HAS COMPARED TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I MEAN SHE SO CLEARLY I APPRECIATE. THAT OUR SUBCOMMITTEE HAS. LOOKED AT THAT IN HIGHLIGHTED IT AS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT BECAUSE I THINK ALL OF US AND I WILL SPEAK NOW FOR MYSELF. I REALLY VALUE THAT ANALYSIS AND WE NEED IT -- NOW LET ME JUST. SAY SOME OTHER THINGS SO WE WE GET REPORTS FROM THEIR LEO. WE ALSO GET REPORTS FROM THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION. WE ALSO GET REPORTS FROM THE STATE AUDITOR. SOMETIMES IN THE SAME YEAR OR TWO YEAR PERIOD. THERE IS AN OVERLAP BETWEEN NOT I MEAN OBVIOUSLY LET'S GIVE AN EXAMPLE THE STATE AUDITOR JUST AUDITED CALIFORNIA'S. REHABILITATION PROGRAMS IN OUR PRISON SYSTEM. THE LA -- DID A REPORT ON OUR REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS I BELIEVE IT WAS. TWENTY SEVENTEEN I DON'T THINK THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION IS AWAITING YET. BUT CLEARLY CALIFORNIA BOTH I'M LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION BUDGETARY DIRECTION AND THE VOTERS. HAS IS MADE IT A PRIORITY THAT WE WANT TO THAT NOT ONLY WE WANT TO PROVIDE QUALITY RE UP BUT WE HAVE -- DESIGNED THE WHOLE SYSTEM IN THE ABILITY FOR A PERSON TO GET BEFORE PRO BOARD BASED ON IT SO CLEARLY IT IS IN AN AREA THAT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO US -- BUT WHAT WOULD I THINK BE HELPFUL IS WHEN. WHEN A DIFFERENT ENTITIES LIKE THE L. LIKE THE AUDITOR DOES SUCH REPORT? IF THE LA -- GIVEN THEIR EXPERTISE. CAN. TAKE THAT INFORMATION AND CORPORATE IT WITH WHAT LA -- KNOWS IN THE ANALYSIS LA ALWAYS DONE SO THAT WE HAVE. A BETTER PICTURE AS WE PROCEED WITH HOW WE WANT AS WE FIGURE OUT HOW WE WANT TO PROCEED SO IT'S NOT JUST KIND OF LIKE ANY MEANING MIND YOU MùT WHICH YOU KNOW WHICH OF THESE. ARE WE WHATEVER DO WE EITHER THINK IS VALID OR AND I THOUGHT THAT IF WE TAKE THE THERE WAS SOME VERY GOOD INFORMATION IN THERE BUT ALSO FELT IT DID NOT. INCOME IS THE BIG PICTURE. OF WHAT IT WAS LEGITIMATELY LOOKING AT CERTAIN -- THE SYSTEMATIC PROBLEMS IN IN CDC ARE OF NOT PROPERLY TRACKING WHO IS IN THE PROGRAM'S. NOT -- PROVIDING THEM EQUALLY ACROSS YARDS AND NOT A NECESSARILY -- SKY SCHEDULING OUR LISTING THE INMATE'S APPROPRIATELY GIVEN OUR OTHER POLICIES. BUT IT THERE WERE SOME BIGGER PICTURE THINGS THAT WERE REALLY MISSING AND THINGS THAT THE LA -- HAS STUDIED IN OPINED ON SO HAVING THE LA -- COME BACK TO US BEFORE E JUST ACT ON THE AUDITOR'S REPORT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL NOW I WANT TO LIE DETAIL THERE BUT I CAN. I CAN GIVE LOTS MORE EXAMPLES THE DMV IS ANOTHER ONE DMV IS GUNS I MEAN THE LA ALWAYS DONE VERY BRIEF JUST LIKE HAND OUT ON OUR DMV ISSUES THE AUDITOR NOW IS DONE A WHOLE LOT IT. WE'VE GOT THE GOVERNOR'S TO TO PUT MONEY AND YOU KNOW BUT IT'S LIKE KATE CAN WE TAKE THE VARIOUS EXPERTISE WE HAVE. AND RY TO SYNCHRONIZE IT SOME SO THAT WE ARE BEING GIVEN. THAT OPTIMAL RECOMMENDATIONS AND AGAIN KNOWING WITH ONE S. WE DON'T ALWAYS RESPOND BUT AT LEAST WOULD BE HELPFUL -- THEN -- ALL AT THE ELLIE OWES SUBJECT MATTER REPORTS SAY IN THE LAST THREE YEARS THEY LEGITIMATELY COVERED THINGS THAT. ARE YOU KNOW ON ARM THAT HAVE BEEN VERY PRESSING OR THAT ARE CONSISTENTLY THINGS THAT WE SHOULD FOLLOW PAY ATTENTION TO BUDGETARY LEE. SO THEY'VE BEEN IN THE AREA OF FIRE RECOVERY FIRE RESPONSE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS DISASTER. OBVIOUSLY LEGITIMATE GIVEN THE LAST FEW YEARS WHETHER IT'S FLOODS FIRES YOU NAME IT. ALSO MEDI CAL AND OTHER HEALTH PROGRAMS CHILD CARE BECAUSE THAT'S BEEN SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN INCREASING FUNDING FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND IS AND THE GOVERNOR NOW HE'S ALSO GOT A GREAT. INTEREST IN ADVANCING SO THERE'S MANY MANY REPORT YOU'VE DONE IN THAT SUBJECT AREA IN HOUSING. BUT THEN WHEN I THINK ABOUT. SO THOSE ARE ALL. LEGITIMATE AND FOLLOW THINGS THAT WE ARE EITHER ENGAGED IN GREATLY OR SHOULD BE BUT THEN WHEN I STEP BACK AND I THINK ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT POTENTIALLY. WE SHOULD BE ENGAGED IN THAT HAVEN'T BEEN WAITIN AND THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET YOUR MENTION THE I. O. U.'S. A COUPLE OF OTHERS -- BUT OUR CALIFORNIA WAS ONE OF THE FIRST STATE TO BELIEVE WE WERE THE FIRST TO SET INCREDIBLY AMBITIOUS WASTE REDUCTION GOALS. AND RECYCLING GOALS. AND WE DON'T A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF IT. BUT WE HAVE NOT WE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE NOT REALLY LOOKED CLOSELY AS TO WHETHER WERE IN FACT REDUCING WASTE NOW. AND THERE'S BEEN A TOTAL CRISIS WE DEPEND ON WE CALIFORNIA ON SENDING THE MATERIALS SOMEWHERE ELSE. JOINT INDONESIA WHEREVER AND HOPING THAT THEY'LL DO SOMETHING WITH THEM THOSE MARKETS HAVE MORE LESS COLLAPSED. SO WHAT WHICH NOW IT IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT WE REALLY HAVE WASTE REDUCTION MUCH AT ALL. AND THAT'S GONNA BE LOOMING GREATER AND GREATER PROBLEM AND YET OUR FOR OUR WHOLE FOUNDATION OF OUR POLICIES ARE ASTE POLICIES ARE CLIMATE PROTECTION PAUL ARE ALL BASED ON THAT WHICH IS COULD BE BRIGHT NOW MYTHICAL. SO. IT YOU KNOW SOME LOOK AT THAT FROM A BIG PICTURE I THINK WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL THE OTHER THING IS. REVENUE SOURCES THE LA -- AS TOO MANY OTHERS ABOUT THE VOLATILITY OF CALIFORNIA'S DEPENDENCE ON PERSONAL INCOME TAX. BUT IT WHAT I'VE SEEN LESS OF IS. THAT BIG PICTURE WHAT ARE THE REVENUE SOURCES THAT HAVE DROPPED WHAT ARE THE REVENUE SOURCES THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN STABLE BUT THAT WE PRETEND TO WE ARE NOT -- IF -- PROPERLY ADVANTAGES. SO WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH SALES TAX NOW THAT WE HAVE FAR LESS BRICK AND MORTAR. OPERATE TAX FOR EXAMPLE IS I'VE STARTED TO LOOK AT SOME RESEARCH AND IT IS THAT AS A PORTION OF OUR GENERAL FUND. OTHER THAN ONE LITTLE BLIP YOU'RE IN THE RECESSION IT IS THE LOWEST PORTION OF OUR GENERAL FUND IT IS EVER BEEN IN HISTORY. AND YET CORPORATIONS NOW ARE WEALTHIER THAN THEY HAVE EVER BEEN. AND RECEIVED THE BIGGEST TAX WINDFALL FROM THE FEDS. AND YOUR CALIFORNIA'S OF A COLLECTING VERY LITTLE. AND IS THAT A SUSTAINABLE OR STABLE WAY FOR US TO HAVE OUR TAX STRUCTURE. AND THEN FINALLY ANOTHER ONE THAT -- AND I KNOW THAT THIS SESSION IS NOT REALLY FOR US TO DO WITH OUR PERSONAL BUT I'M TRYING. TO THINK ABOUT THOSE OVERVIEW IS. GREAT IS THOSE. AREAS OF OUR BUDGET. THAT HAVE GROWN CLEARLY EDUCATION LEGITIMATE LEAD THE DEMAND THE NEGROES. BUT THOSE AREAS WHERE WE SHOULD BE PAYING ATTENTION. THAT THE STATE DID THEIR GROWING ONE PERHAPS ONE COULD CALL STATE ALL SAY DISPROPORTIONATELY SOMEBODY ELSE MAYBE SHOULDN'T PUT ST THE SAME. VALUE JUDGMENT ON IT BUT RATHER. WHAT IS SO LET'S ALL GIVE THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE ONE FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE -- POPULATION DOWN WE HAVE DONE REAL WHAT WE'VE DONE ALL THESE THINGS. AND YET. ARE NOT YET WE KNOW SOME OF THE REASONS WHY. BUT IF IF. THE NUMBERS WERE TO CONTINUE TO GROW AS THEY HAVE SAY IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. WHAT WE COULD GET TO A SITUATION WHERE CORRECTIONS WAS? 30% OF OUR GF MAYBE THAT'S AN EXAGGERATION BUT IN IS THAT REALLY THE DIRECTION WE WANT TO GO IN. AND SO I BRING IT UP BECAUSE VERY OFTEN. FOR MYSELF AS CHAIR OF THAT SUBCOMMITTEE THE ANALYSIS OF EACH LITTLE INDEPENDENT BUDGET REQUEST WHICH IS A TEENY THING. VERSUS ANY KIND OF ANALYSIS OVER THIS BIG PICTURE WHAT SHOULD WE BE DOING SO THAT WE CAN OVER TIME. YOU KNOW GET GET THESE THINGS UNDER CONTROL SO THOSE ARE THE ISSUES THAT ARE ON MY MIND AND I APPRECIATE BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS AND THANK YOU. YOU THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. TWO THINGS ARE ONE OF THE NEW BRIEFLY HERE ONE IS TO AMPLIFY SOMETHING THAT YOU JUST HEARD FROM SOMEONE TING AND FROM-SENATOR SKINNER. ABOUT THE A WILDFIRE LIABILITY ISSUE AND I THINK THAT THAT WAS REALLY MISSED OPPORTUNITY BY THE LA -- LAST YEAR NOT TO WEIGH IN ON THAT AND YOU KNOW NOT AT A A GROUND LEVEL WAY BUT IF THE THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT VIEW. OF THE DIFFERENT ISSUES OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES OF TOUCH AND THAT ONE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF LETTING THAT LIABILITY FLOW THROUGH THE UTILITIES WHAT ARE THE IMPACTS ON P. G.'S BANKRUPTCY. ON TAXPAYERS AND RATEPAYERS IN THE STATE AND IF SB NINE A ONE WAS EXPANDED WHAT WOULD BE THE IMPACT ON RATE PAYERS AND TAXPAYERS ON PASSING THAT LIABILITY. ON TO THEM IN SECURITIZED AHEAD SO -- IF IF YOU WANT AN EXAMPLE OF I THINK SOMETHING A SITUATION WHERE THE ONLY -- DID THAT REALLY WELL A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO REALLY GOOD HAD INFORMATION THAT WE DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO ANYWHERE ELSE. SO I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE THE LA -- TAKE A HOLISTIC VIEW OF THAT TOPIC THIS YEAR BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW. OUR GOVERNOR HAS SAID THAT THAT'S A TOP PRIORITY FOR HIS ADMINISTRATION IT'S CLEAR THAT WE NEED TO GET OUR ARMS AROUND THAT -- IN ANOTHER. ON A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TOPIC. I KNOW A LOT OF US. ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE HAVE BEEN WATCHING WITH A LITTLE BIT OF ALARM AT BUT STATE REVENUES HAVE BEEN DOING IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS AND IN DECEMBER I SAW. THE THE COLLECTIONS COME IN UNDER PROJECTIONS AND I KNOW THAT THERE WAS SPECULATION ABOUT THAT WAS RELATED TO THE DECLINE IN THE STOCK MARKET -- WAS -- TO IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN FEDERAL TAX LAW BUT THEN IN THE MONTHS THAT HAVE -- PASSED SINCE THEN WE HAVE STE STILL CONTINUE TO COME IN UNDER PROJECTION AND SO -- I KNOW THAT THE CRITICAL MONTH IS GOING TO BE NEXT MONTH THAT WAS A TROUBLING OR WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS A TREND IN A HARBINGER OF THINGS TO COME -- WHAT OUR CURRENT -- IT ASSESSMENT OF THAT IS THAT SOME OF IT COULD WELL BE MADE UP IN APRIL FROM THE FOR AS A RESULT OF THE TIME IN A FAX. HOWEVER I DO THINK AS WE MOVE TOWARD -- A SECOND FORECAST THAT WE DO EACH YEAR IN MAY THAT ROUGH TIME TO COME OUT ROUGHLY WITH THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION -- I WON'T BE SURPRISED IF THE FORECAST IS ADJUSTED DOWNWARD SOME SO. I'M NOT REALLY IN A POSITION. TO FULLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION AT THIS TIME BUT AND YOU KNOW IN IN ALL THE OPENNESS  THINK. I THINK WE WON'T BE SURPRISED IF THERE'S SOME DOWNWARD REVISION TO THE FORECAST AT THAT TIME. THANKS I'M SURE WE'LL BE TALKING MORE ABOUT THIS YEAH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THEN WELCOME SYSTEMATIC WOULD LEAD TO HAVE YOU ON BOARD THANK YOU SENATOR. MONDAY AT THE PHENOMENA ZICH THE NEXT AND AROUND HERE FOR SOME TIME [inaudible] AND MIGHT SAY IT'S A PRODUCT OF TERM LIMITS. MAY BE PART OF THE SOCIETAL. BUT IT'S WHAT I CALL KIND OF LACK OF VISION. AND ALSO SIMULTANEOUSLY A LACK OF INTELLECTUAL CURIOSITY ABOUT THE HISTORY. SO WE MAKE A DECISION ABOUT SOME ISSUE OR SOME LEGISLATION. IT'S LIKE THE LIGHT BULB JUST WENT OFF AND HERE WE GO. BUT WE DON'T THINK WE'LL HOW DID THAT EVOLVE TO THIS POINT AND WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN TRIED BEFORE. THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT IN OTHER WORDS. THAT TURNED HIS IMPAIRED US I BELIEVE ALSO FROM MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT PROJECTION. OF THE FUTURE WHAT WILL THIS MEAN TEN OR TWENTY YEARS. DOWN THE WHITE. I REMEMBER ASKING HAVE OF SOME OF US MEETING IN A GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER'S OFFICE ON A NEW WATER PLAN WAY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE WHAT WILL THIS MEAN FOR OUR GRANDCHILDREN. AND A BLANK LOOKS AROUND THE ROOM TOLD ME ALL I NEEDED NO THAT WASN'T ON ANYBODY'S MIND. THAT INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE IS IN AFTER THAT TO THE POINT THEM -- THE THE LA -- DOES A VERY FINE JOB AND I'M NOT CRITICIZING I'M JUST SUGGESTING TO KEEP FOCUSED. ON SOME OF THE HISTORIC DEVELOPMENTS THAT BROUGHT US TO THIS MOMENT IN TIME WHEN YOU'RE ANALYZING WHATEVER IT IS THE TRAVEL ISING. IN ADDITION TO TRY TO BE HELPFUL TO US IN PROJECTING WHAT ARE THE EVENTUALITIES IN THE FUTURE THAT WE MIGHT EXPERIENCE. FROM THIS. CERTAINLY BECAUSE OF THE FRAGILITY OF OUR BUDGET BALANCING AND A LOT OF THINGS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS WE MAKE DECISIONS MOVING AHEAD IN ADDITION. THE SENATE HAS PARTICULAR BEEN CONCERNED WITH OVERSIGHT FOR A FEW YEARS. NOW THAT MEANS THE OVERSIGHT IS GONE A LITTLE BIT BEYOND JUST POLICY COMMITTEES IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE IN THE BUDGET ITSELF. OF DOING SOME VERY SPECIAL LOOKING AT THEWITH THE OVERSIGHT OF AGENCIES. IT WOULD WELCOME YOUR HELP IN IN THAT AS WELL. WE HAVE SOME TROUBLE AGENCIES THE DMV BE IN ONE THE OFFICE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND IT HAD MANY DIFFERENT NAMES AS I THINK THE MOST RECENT IS DO WHAT DEPARTMENT OF VINTAGE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY BUT WE'VE OF SQUANDERED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THOSE KINDS OF PHENOMENA IN OUR BUDGET IF YOU COULD HELP US ANTICIPATE. LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES OF THAT. AS YOUR LAN THAT VITAL SAY RESTRUCTURING BUT PRIORITIZING OR DEPLOYING YOUR RATHER LIMITED RESOURCES. THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT AND FUTURE. EVENTUALITIES WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL TO US. THANK YOU SENATOR -- YET WE I THINK -- I CAN I TAKE YOUR POINT I THINK WE DO A LOT OF OUR WORK IS FOCUSED ON FISCAL AND BUDGET RELATED MATTERS. AND WE PROBABLY HAVE LESS -- RESOURCES TO DEDICATE TO DOING -- PROGRAM REVIEWS POLICY AND ANALYSIS DEPARTMENTAL REVIEWS AND I THINK -- THAT SOMETHING WE WILL BE DISCUSSING -- GOING FORWARD AND I MEAN FOR THE RECORD WE WE ARE NEUTRAL ON THE% ON THE PROPOSAL FROM -- ASSEMBLYMEMBER OBERNOLTE BUT YOU KNOW IT IF ANYBODY WERE TO ASK I THINK YOU KNOW FOR OUR OFFICE DID HAVE MORE RESOURCES. AND THOSE WOULD BE IF YOU ASK ME THOSE WOULD BE SOME OF THE AREAS THAT I THINK WE WOULD EXPLORE. IN MORE DETAIL. AND BE GREAT WELL THE THE CHARGES DILUTED TO SOMETHING A A MOMENT AGO THAT. I CERTAINLY WAS ENTERTAINING AND AND BECAUSE MAYBE THE SUBCOMMITTEE OF THIS THAT STAFF OF SUBCOMMITTEE. ENQUIRING IF OUR BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES OF CERTAIN ISSUES THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL. AND THEN AS A THE SUBCOMMITTEE STAFF WILL PREPARE THE MEMBERS. THAT WOULD BE INSTRUCTED TO US THANK YOU. FOR THE MEMBER WEBER. THE WELCOME IN A AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO OBVIOUSLY HAVING A VERY -- PRODUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU IN YOUR OFFICE -- I'M SURE YOU PROBABLY REALIZE THAT IN THE IN THE BUDGET PROCESS ALL OF US HAVE CERTAIN LEVELS OF FRUSTRATION. IN MUCH OF IT REVOLVES AROUND THE FACT THAT -- WE HAVE LOTS OF THINGS THAT ARE NOT -- APPROPRIATELY HANDLE IN CALIFORNIA WHETHER IT'S DEALING WITH THE HOMELESS OR DEALING WITH THE POP ISSUE POVERTY. OR EDUCATION AND THE DIRECTION WE'RE GOING IN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND AND PROBABLY IF YOU PUT IT ALL TOGETHER WE WOULD PROBABLY ALSO KIND OF THE BE ALIGNED IN TERMS OF THE THINGS WE THINK THAT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT -- YET THE RESOURCES DO NOT ALLOW US TO ROUTE TO BASICALLY -- OF BASICALLY RESPOND TO OUR PRIORITIES YOU KNOW OFTEN PEOPLE SAY THE BUDGET IS A REFLECTION OF YOUR PRIORITIES. AND IF THAT WERE THE CASE AND PROBABLY ARE BUDGET WOULD REFLECT OUR FRUSTRATION MUCH MORE THAN ANY ANY KIND OF PRIORITIES. BECAUSE WE DO HAVE SOME STE A NUMBER OF DEEP IN AND SERIOUS ISSUES AND CHALLENGES. AND YET -- WE DON'T SEEM TO HAVE A ADEQUATELY GET TO THE UP TO THE BOTTOM OF IT AND THEN GIVE US DIRECTION AS TO HOW WE GET GET BEYOND THAT YOU KNOW HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF FUNDING. OUR EDUCATION IN OUR SCHOOLS -- HOW DO WE GET TO THE ISSUE OF DEALING WITH THE ISSUE OF POVERTY OR HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE REALLY BREAKING THE BACK OF CALIFORNIA? WITH ALL THE WONDERFUL THINGS WE DO WE STILL ARE STANDING IN THE SHADOW OF A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF ISSUES AND CONCERNS. THAT GET TO THE BASIC ISSUE OF HIM OUR OF OUR HUMANITY AND OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OF THE SOUL. I'M NOT SURE WHETHER YOUR OFFICE IS CAPABLE OF DOING IT BUT BUT I THINK IF YOU TALK ABOUT. ALL TRYING TO DO THOSE THINGS THAT ARE DIFFERENT AUG GIVING SOME DIRECTION TO US THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT ALL IT WOULD PROBABLY PROVIDE MAYBE THE IMPETUS FOR PEOPLE TO THE TO THE STEP OUT. BEYOND THEIR PARTY AFFILIATIONS OR FEARS OF CITIZENS OR WHATEVER MAY BE BECAUSE CLEARLY -- WHATEVER WE'RE DOING WE TALK ABOUT ALL TIME TENS OF OUR TAX BASE REVENUE -- EVERYBODY SAYS IS NOT RIGHT NO ONE WANTS TO TAKE IT ON NO ONE WANTS TO TELL US HOW TO CORRECT IT. WELL THE DIRECTION WE NEED TO GO IN ORDER TO TO RIGHT THE SHIP ALSO IT'S AN ONGOING CHALLENGE WE TRIED -- WHEN I WAS HERE THE BUDGET FOR WHAT -- STARTED THE PROCESS OF ZERO BASED BUDGETING AND WE DID IT WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THE GOAL WAS TO DO THAT EVERY YEAR WITH A DIFFERENT PORTION OF THE BUDGET AND IT JUST KIND OF DIED DIDN'T GO VERY FAR -- BUT BECAUSE AS LONG AS YOU CONTINUE TO FUND THE THINGS YOU'VE ALWAYS FUNDED. YOU ALWAYS GET THE RESULTS YOU'VE ALREADY ALWAYS GOTTEN AND THAT SEEMS TO BE THE CHALLENGE IS HOW DO WE GET BEYOND THAT HOW WE LOOK AT THE EFFICIENCY OR THE INEFFICIENCY OF MANY AGENCIES. AND HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THIS IN A DIFFERENT WAY IF WE DON'T END UP INCREASING REVENUES WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THE REVENUES WE HAVE. AND WHAT THE NOT THAT'S THE MOST EFFECTIVE USE OF IT GIVEN THE VALUES THAT WE HAVE BUT WE BEGIN THAT PROCESS IN THERE WERE SOME CHANGES MADE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TERMS OF THE FUNDING OF THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE AND SO FORTH AND SO ON AND THINGS THAT WERE -- KIND OF OUT OF SYNC WITH THE VALUES OF THE LEGISLATURE BUT WE HAVE YET TO REALLY -- BEGIN TO CONTINUE TO ASSESS AND WE SAID WE DO THIS EVERY YEAR SO-THAT -- AGENCIES OR SECTIONS OF THE BUDGET WOULD KNOW THAT IT WAS COMING THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO IT WASN'T LIKE A WOULD BE A ONE YEAR THING THAT THEY KNEW AND THREE YEARS WE HAVE. TO BASICALLY DO ZERO BASED BUDGETING AND JUSTIFY WHAT THE MONEY WE HAVE AND AND WHAT WHAT'S BEING ACCOMPLISHED IN ALL THIS THERE SO THAT BECOMES IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE JUST DID SOMETHING WITH -- I GUESS THE ONE ON WE WERE GETTING THE RESULTS YOU WANT IN TERMS OF REHABILITATION -- BUT WE JIM RESPONDED THOSE THINGS AFTER THE FACT RATHER THAN BEFORE. AND IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT WHERE THE MONEY IS AND HOW IT'S GOING TO GO AND WHERE IT'S GOING TO GO TO WHAT IS NOT GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE WELL WE JUST KIND OF FUNDING THE SAME OLD THING THAT WE'VE ALWAYS DONE SO. I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'RE HOPEFULLY IF YOU GET MORE STAFF TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. BUT I THINK WE DO NEED TO BEGIN TO REALLY HONE IN ON THAT BECAUSE THAT'S THE FRUSTRATION. OF OF AT LEAST MY FRUSTRATION WHEN EVEN WHEN I WAS CHAIR OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ON THE BUDGET. THAT WE HAVE SSI AND YOUKNOW WE HAVE ALL THESE FOLKS THAT ARE STRUGGLING WITH LITTLE OR NO MONEY OUR SENIORS ARE NOT BEING ADEQUATELY CARED. FOR AND WHEN WE DO EVERY DAY EVERY TO EVERYTHING UP IT CAME OUT TO BE ABOUT WHAT A DOLLAR FIFTY SAID SOMETHING PER PERSON. AT WHICH WAS RIDICULOUS. YOU KNOW FOR THE CLASS WE WOULD JUST ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS AND SO IT WAS IT WAS AN INSULT EVEN MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PROPOSAL. OF BECAUSE OF WHAT LITTLE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO -- SO I THINK THOSE ARE KIND OF ACCOUNTS OF REALLY HARD AND THE WHOLE ISSUE OF HOW DO WE GET TO ZERO BASED BUDGETING ON A CYCLE EVERY NOW AND THEN TO REALLY ASSESS WHAT WE'VE DONE. THANK YOU YOU -- OKAY. JUST A JUST JUST TO QUICKLY SORT OF ANSWER DOCTOR WEBBER'S. QUESTION ON WE CONTINUE TO DO ZERO BASED BUDGETING BURKE CLEARLY WE'RE NOT COMMUNICATING IT WELL ENOUGH BECAUSE WE'RE STARTING WITH A FEW. VERY SMALL DEPARTMENTS AND IT'S KßT IS THE GOAL IS TO ROLL IT OUT THROUGHOUT THE A DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE STATE AND SO. THE THING THAT BY MYSELF MISTER OBERNOLTE MISTER MCCARTY AND OFFICE TO TALK TO WEBER WAS VERY INTERESTED IN SO -- CLEARLY WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF COMMUNICATING THAT AS WELL SO THE SYSTEMS ARE YOU DOING. I FORGET THE LAST ROUND OF THE ART SO -- WE WE WILL. BRING THAT BACK -- I WILL OBVIOUSLY GET THAT INFORMATION TO OUR SENATE BUDGET CHAIRMAN ALSO YOU PROBABLY HAVE A SEPARATE BUDGET HEARING ON THAT PARTICULAR ITEMS WHAT WHICH WHICH WE DID LAST YEAR. NOT THINKING CLEARLY -- NEEDS A LITTLE MORE. INFORMATION EXCELLENT. US SENATOR STONE. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIRWOMAN PROBLEMS COLLEAGUES SINCE GREAT TO SEE YOU SIR AGAIN APPROVED PRECEDED -- TO MEETING YOU IN MY OFFICE AND GOT A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT FOR UNITED LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU -- NOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN IN THE TELL ME HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE LA OWES OFFICE VERSUS THE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS THERE IS THAT GLASS WALL IN BETWEEN BOTH OF YOU WERE. MORE OR DO YOU FIND YOURSELVES -- COLLABO COLLABORATING A LOT AND THEN. HOW DO YOU RECONCILE SIGNIFICANT -- DIFFERENCES SO AS AN EXAMPLE I THINK I MIGHT IN LAST YEAR YOUR BUDGET FORECASTS WAS A COUPLE BILLION DOLLARS MORE THAN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHICH I WOULD EXPECT IT TO BE THE REVERSE BUT YOU GUYS WERE A LITTLE MORE -- LOFTY ON YOUR EXPECTATIONS -- SO I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW YOU'RE GONNA RECKONS AND ONE OF MY GOALS IN THE LEGISLATURE HAS CERTAINLY BEEN -- TO EMBRACE TECHNOLOGY AND I I'VE HAD A LOT OF ROAD BIKES AND AND BRACING TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE ARE SOME THAT BELIEVE THAT -- THE TECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO REPLACE. PEOPLE IN JOBS WHEN IN FACT IT'S GOING TO CREATE -- HIGHER LEVEL JOBS AND AND MORE OPPORTUNITIES ESPECIALLY COMING FROM A STATE THAT HAS SUCH A A LARGE TECHNOLOGICAL BASE BASICALLY THE TECHNOLOGY CENTER OF THE WORLD. THIS RARE BURKLE'S ACELA COMMONALITIES SO -- TO KNOW ABOUT -- YOUR YOUR YOUR NEW TENURE AND pON IT BECAUSE SHOES WITH REGARD TO TECHNOLOGY AND AND THE ADVANTAGES OF THE STATE TO PURSUE CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES. TO MAKE US RUN A MORE EFFICIENT I MEAN CERTAINLY THE DMV IS A POSTER CHILD FOR HOW WE COULD PROBABLY USE TECHNOLOGY A LOT BETTER -- BUT WE NEED SOME INDEPENDENT -- CODIFICATION IF YOU WILL THAT WE'RE EMBARKING DOWN THE RIGHT PATH -- OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR STONE NICE NICE TO SEE YOU WE I I GUESS THE FIRST THING I'D SAY IS -- I DON'T KNOW IF WE WOULD pTO TRY AND RECONCILE OUR FORECAST WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BUT POINT OUT HOW WE ARRIVED AT OUR FOECAST. FOR YOU TO CONSIDER IN YOUR DELIBERATIONS. AND THERE ARE INDEPENDENCE WE THINK IS AN IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTIC THAT ALLOWS US TO BETTER SERVE YOU THE LEGISLATURE. WE THINK IT LENDS TO THE CREDIBILITY OF THE CONCLUSIONS WE REACH AND THEN IF YOU HAVE CREDIBLE CONCLUSIONS FROM US THAT YOU CAN THEN USE IN YOUR DISCUSSIONS. WE THINK THAT'S A SERVICE THAT WE PROVIDE TO YOU WE ALSO THINK OUR CREDIBILITY IS CRUCIAL ESPECIALLY GIVEN OUR ROLE ON THE VOTER. INFORMATION GUIDES IN THE BALLOT AND VOTER INITIATIVE ANALYSIS. BECAUSE IF WE WERE TO BE QUESTIONED IN TERMS OF OUR INDEPENDENCE AND CREDIBILITY OVER HERE WHAT'S TO SAY WE WOULDN'T BE QUESTIONED OVER THERE SO. THAT'S ALL TO SAY I THINK IT'S A VERY. INTEGRAL PART OF OUR OFFICE IN IT TO THE IT'S VERY SAD -- IT IT'S A DEEP PART OF THE CULTURE ACTUALLY I'VE BEEN SET HAVING INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS WITH EACH MEMBER OF THE STAFF IN ADDITION TO MEETING WITH YOU ALL. AND YOUR STAFF SAID BEEN MEETING WITH OUR STAFF INDEPENDENTLY HI. AND YOU KNOW IT REALLY COMES ACROSS IN THESE MEETINGS THAT THE OFFICE. IT THE OFFICES INDEPENDENCE IS AN IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTIC THAT THAT THEY ALL SEEM TO VALUE QUITE HIGHLY. AS FOR TECHNOLOGY. WE ARE IN THE WORKING ON A REPORT RIGHT NOW AND IT'S ONE OF THESE. TOPICS THAT I THINK WE HAVE A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE WE HAVE A CROSS CUTTING VIEWPOINT. ON THE STATE TECHNOLOGY IS AN ISSUE THAT SEASON DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT AND DEPARTMENTS SORT OF LIKE INFRASTRUCTURE. IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S NECESSARILY A SINGLE FOCAL POINT FOR THE ISSUE OF TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE IT AFFECTS ALL OF US IN ALL DEPARTMENTS OF THE STATE. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR GREATER EFFICIENCIES IN THE ONE THING I HAVE BROUGHT UP WITH OUR STAFF MEMBER THE OTHER DAY IS THAT THERE'S ALSO RISK. WE HEAR MORE ABOUT THE RISK OF CYBERSECURITY IN THOSE KIND OF THREATS AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW WE HAVE AN HAD A MAJOR INCIDENT LIKE THAT AT THIS POINT BUT THAT'S THE KIND OF THING WE SHOULD BE TRYING TO THINK AHEAD ABOUT AND SEE YOU. HOW WELL PREPARED ARE WE FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND WHAT COULD WE DO TO BE MORE PREPARED SO? IT'S IT'S ONE OF MY PRIORITIES AS WELL SENATOR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER ANY FINAL QUESTIONS.
