SIXTEEN DURING THE WARTIMETO

00:43:33.811 --> 00:43:35.779
CONSERVE ENERGY BUT NOW WE FIND

00:43:35.846 --> 00:43:37.247

MORE HARM THAN GOOD.

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:42.086
BECAUSE THE EXTRA HOURS OF LOSS

AVERAGE MONDAYS IN A CAR CRASH.

00:44:03.507 --> 00:44:05.843
THERE'S A FIVE POINT 7% JUMP IN

WORKPLACE INJURIES AND NEARLY

00:44:08.278 --> 00:44:11.382
68% MORE WORK THEY LOST TO

00:44:11.448 --> 00:44:12.049
INJURIES.

00:44:12.116 --> 00:44:13.083
MICHIGAN HOSPITAL HAS DONE A

HEART ATTACK 25% JUMP IN NUMBERS

00:44:18.288 --> 00:44:19.456
A HEART ATTACK TO SUCK THE

COMPARED TO OTHER MONDAYS AND

00:44:23.627 --> 00:44:26.063
THE OPPOSITE EFFECT IS ALSO TRUE

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:28.832
STUDY SHOWS THAT 21% DROP IN

00:44:28.899 --> 00:44:30.701
HEART ATTACK ON A DAY AFTER WE

00:44:30.768 --> 00:44:32.302

01:05:29.025 --> 01:05:33.229

THAT THEY WILL GET TO MEET MANNY

01:05:49.211 --> 01:05:51.147
