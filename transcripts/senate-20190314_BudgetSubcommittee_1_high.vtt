DOES THIS REALLY WORK.

00:08:16.929 --> 00:08:18.564
SURE SO --

00:08:18.631 --> 00:08:20.433
FIRST WE CAN TALK ABOUT KIND OF

00:08:20.499 --> 00:08:22.802
RETROSPECTIVELY SO FOR LOOKING

00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:24.303
AT PRIOR YEARS AND NOT HAVING

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:25.872

ANYMORE --

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.207
ESSENTIALLY WHAT LITTLE FUNCTION

00:08:28.274 --> 00:08:31.177
HOW IT HAD FOR YEARS WHERE IN A

00:08:31.244 --> 00:08:33.479
PRIOR YEAR WHERE --

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:35.114
THERE WERE ANOTHER WEEK'S

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:36.716
EXPERIENCE A DROP IN THE FOR

00:08:36.782 --> 00:08:37.917
EXAMPLE IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WE

00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:39.218
HAD OVER A PRODUCTION --

00:08:39.285 --> 00:08:40.519
THAT WE ARE NOW PROPOSING TO

00:08:40.586 --> 00:08:42.421
OVER APPROPRIATE BY FORTY FOUR

00:08:42.488 --> 00:08:43.289
MILLION.

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:45.157
ESSENTIALLY LOOKING FORWARD IN

00:08:45.224 --> 00:08:46.692
THE FUTURE FUTURE YEARS IF WE

00:08:46.759 --> 00:08:48.361
HAVE THAT SAME TYPE OF SITUATION

00:08:48.427 --> 00:08:50.062
WE WOULD JUST HAVE THE DECISION

00:08:50.129 --> 00:08:53.466
TO MAKE DO WE MAKE THAT --

00:08:53.532 --> 00:08:55.134
REDUCE THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE AND

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:56.802
SOMEHOW CLAWED BACK THAT MONEY

00:08:56.869 --> 00:08:58.137
POTENTIALLY WHICH HISTORICALLY

00:08:58.204 --> 00:09:00.306
IT HAS BEEN VERY UNCOMMON OR DO

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:02.675
WE JUST OVER APPROPRIATE TO

00:09:02.742 --> 00:09:04.310
GUARANTEE AND SENSUALLY GIVE

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:05.811
THAT CERTAINTY TO SCHOOLS THAT

00:09:05.878 --> 00:09:06.913
THEY KNOW OKAY I'M NOT GOING TO

00:09:06.979 --> 00:09:08.547
LOSE BACK ON THAT ON THAT.

00:09:08.614 --> 00:09:09.982
CASH THAT ALREADY HAVE THAT'S

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:12.418
ALREADY GONE OUT --

00:09:12.485 --> 00:09:13.786
NOT A LOT CHANGES THERE IT JUST

00:09:13.853 --> 00:09:15.121
DOESN'T GIVE THE STATE THE

00:09:15.187 --> 00:09:17.523
FLEXIBILITY TO BE ABLE --

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:19.058
TO COUNT THAT OVER PREPARATION

00:09:19.125 --> 00:09:20.359
IN THIS CASE --

00:09:20.426 --> 00:09:21.661
WITHIN THE COST ALLOCATION

00:09:21.727 --> 00:09:22.828
SCHEDULE TO THEN BE ABLE TO USE

00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:25.197
TOWARDS A OF A POTENTIAL FUTURE

00:09:25.264 --> 00:09:26.966
SETTLE UP DEBT --

00:09:27.033 --> 00:09:30.336
AND AS WE LOOK PRO SUBJECTIVELY --

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:32.171
IT DOESN'T CHANGE --

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:35.141
A WHOLE LOT ON ON THAT END

00:09:35.207 --> 00:09:36.842
BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY --

00:09:36.909 --> 00:09:39.245
WE ALREADY.

00:09:39.312 --> 00:09:41.914

WE'D WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT'S

00:09:46.652 --> 00:09:47.353
GOING TO LOOK LIKE IT THAT'S

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.754
WITH THOUGHT THOSE ARE ALL.

00:09:48.821 --> 00:09:50.890
RETROSPECTIVE CALCULATION SO AS

00:09:50.957 --> 00:09:52.558
WE LOOK --

00:09:52.625 --> 00:09:54.694

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.128
THE PROPOSAL THAT I JUST.

00:09:56.195 --> 00:09:58.864
MENTIONED DOESN'T REALLY IMPACT

00:09:58.931 --> 00:10:01.367
OUR OUR PROSPECT OF BUDGETING --

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:02.802
THAT MUCH IT WE WE STILL WOULD

00:10:02.868 --> 00:10:04.203
HAVE MOST OF THE SAME OPTIONS

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.706

STILL BE --

00:10:33.265 --> 00:10:35.067
A MECHANISM WHEREBY WE WILL

00:10:35.134 --> 00:10:36.869

THAT THAT THAT WILL STILL EXIST --

00:10:48.247 --> 00:10:50.816

ALLOCATION SCHEDULE I MENTIONED

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:53.953
THAT WILL NOT EXIST AND THAT WAS

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.454
SOMETHING THAT WAS NEW --

00:10:55.521 --> 00:10:58.124
WITH THE WITH WHAT WAS PASSED AT

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:00.860

PASSED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT

00:11:12.872 --> 00:11:13.672
I APOLOGIZE IF YOU ALREADY

00:11:13.739 --> 00:11:14.306

00:11:14.373 --> 00:11:15.307
LITTLE BIT LATE.

00:11:15.374 --> 00:11:17.476
WHY WAS PROP ONE ELEVEN AT IT

00:11:17.543 --> 00:11:20.746

ELEVEN WAS LARGELY A RESULT OF I

00:11:28.154 --> 00:11:29.422
FORGET EXACTLY WHICH I THINK IT

00:11:29.488 --> 00:11:30.756
MIGHT HAVE BEEN --

00:11:30.823 --> 00:11:32.591
NINETEEN NINETY THAT THERE WAS A

00:11:32.658 --> 00:11:34.160
THERE WAS A RECESSION --

00:11:34.226 --> 00:11:35.394
AND THAT AFFECT THE WHAT

00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:37.696
HAPPENED WHERE YOU HAD A PROP --

00:11:37.763 --> 00:11:39.899
EXCUSE ME TEST ONE WHICH IS

00:11:39.965 --> 00:11:41.033
MEANT TO BE OF WHERE --

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.036
PROP NINETY EIGHT SHARES A OF

GENERAL FUND FISCALLY ABOUT 40%.

00:11:46.572 --> 00:11:47.973
AND THEN TEST TO WHERE IT'S A

00:11:49.442 --> 00:11:51.444
INCOME.

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:54.313
AND THOSE WERE THE THE ONLY TWO

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.549
POSSIBLE TAX BUT IT CAME TO BE

00:11:56.615 --> 00:11:59.418
THAT IN A RECESSION SCENARIO --

00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:01.620
THE GUARANTEE WAS ESSENTIALLY

00:12:01.687 --> 00:12:03.322
OUTPACING ACTUAL GROWTH IN THE

00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:05.224
ECONOMY IN THIS CASE A DECREASE

00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:07.359
IN THE ECONOMY BUT WE HAD NO WAY.

00:12:07.426 --> 00:12:08.060
TO WITHOUT SPENDING THE

00:12:08.127 --> 00:12:09.028

KIND OF ACCOUNT FOR THAT WITH

00:12:11.197 --> 00:12:13.165
THE ECONOMY WAS DOING --

00:12:13.232 --> 00:12:15.367

00:12:16.936 --> 00:12:19.004
WAS ADDED AND TO BE ABLE --

00:12:19.071 --> 00:12:20.372
TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT PER CAPITA

00:12:20.439 --> 00:12:22.708
GENERAL FUND REVENUES AND THEN --

00:12:22.775 --> 00:12:24.443
WITH THAT NOW BE ABLE TAKE INTO

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:25.644
ACCOUNT WHEN THERE ARE YEARS

00:12:25.711 --> 00:12:27.279
WHERE -- THE

00:12:27.346 --> 00:12:28.647
ECONOMY IS IS --

00:12:28.714 --> 00:12:30.282
DOING WELL BUT MAYBE GENERAL

FUND REVENUES ARE DOING AS WELL

00:12:32.218 --> 00:12:32.985
SO THAT THE STATE'S NOT DOING AS

00:12:33.052 --> 00:12:34.587
WELL A WEARABLE TO TAKE THAT

00:12:34.653 --> 00:12:35.721
INTO ACCOUNT WHEN CALCULATING

00:12:35.788 --> 00:12:37.456
GUARANTEE AND HAVE IT GROW OUT

00:12:37.523 --> 00:12:38.057
OF PROPORTION THAT'S A LITTLE

00:12:38.124 --> 00:12:38.858
BIT MORE.

00:12:38.924 --> 00:12:39.925
SUSTAINABLE GIVING WHAT'S

00:12:39.992 --> 00:12:41.227
HAPPENING --

00:12:41.293 --> 00:12:43.195
WITH WITH THE GUARANTEE THIS WAS

00:12:43.262 --> 00:12:47.399
A WAY TO REDUCE PROP NINETY

00:12:47.466 --> 00:12:48.701
EIGHT FUNDING AND RECESSION.

00:12:48.767 --> 00:12:51.036
IT WAS IT WAS A WAY TO MAKE IT

00:12:51.103 --> 00:12:52.705
ABLE TO GROW MORE --

00:12:52.771 --> 00:12:54.940
PROPORTIONALLY WITH THE ECONOMY

00:12:55.007 --> 00:12:56.208
LIKE I SAID.

00:12:56.275 --> 00:12:58.444
LIKE TO LET THE LA ALSO.

00:12:58.511 --> 00:13:00.112
THANK YOU BACKGROUND.

00:13:00.179 --> 00:13:01.547
YES THANK YOU AT SOME DALY

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:03.115
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION CAN UPON

00:13:03.182 --> 00:13:03.916
WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S

00:13:03.983 --> 00:13:04.817
OFFICE.

00:13:04.884 --> 00:13:05.851
OF THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF

00:13:05.918 --> 00:13:08.654
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT TO

00:13:08.721 --> 00:13:09.255
NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT AFFECTED

00:13:09.321 --> 00:13:10.623
LEE CREATED A FIRE WALL AROUND

00:13:10.689 --> 00:13:12.691
SCHOOL FUNDING--

00:13:12.758 --> 00:13:13.259
BUT AS YOU KNOW SCHOOLS AND

00:13:13.325 --> 00:13:16.395
COMMUNITY STATE BUDGET AND WE

00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:17.696
ENTERED A RECESSION IT TURNED

00:13:17.763 --> 00:13:19.064
OUT TO BE PRETTY DIFFICULT FOR

00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:20.299
THE STATE TO BALANCE THE BUDGET

00:13:20.366 --> 00:13:22.301
WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO MAKE SOME

00:13:22.368 --> 00:13:24.103
ADJUSTMENTS TO SCHOOL FUNDING.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:25.571
OPPOSITION WHEN ELEVEN THAT

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:27.106
CREATED SOME NEW FORMULAS LIKE

00:13:27.173 --> 00:13:29.008
MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED BUT THERE

00:13:29.074 --> 00:13:30.075
THE REAL THRUST OF THE MEASURE

00:13:30.142 --> 00:13:31.510
WAS LEADING THE STATE PROVIDE

00:13:31.577 --> 00:13:32.912
SCHOOLS A LITTLE BIT LESS DURING

00:13:32.978 --> 00:13:34.380
TIGHT FISCAL TIMES.

00:13:34.446 --> 00:13:35.481
IN EXCHANGE FOR GROWING SCHOOL

00:13:35.548 --> 00:13:37.216
FUNDING BY QUICKLY WHEN THE

00:13:37.283 --> 00:13:37.650
ECONOMY RECOVERED.

00:13:37.716 --> 00:13:42.555
GREAT THANK YOU [inaudible]

00:13:42.621 --> 00:13:43.989
SEVERAL QUESTIONS.

00:13:44.056 --> 00:13:44.256
LA -- DID

00:13:44.323 --> 00:13:47.793
YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THE

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.361
BERMAN OF FINANCE PRESENTATION.

00:13:49.428 --> 00:13:50.629
YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'LL

00:13:50.696 --> 00:13:53.165
I'LL JUST KEEP MY REMARKS --

00:13:53.232 --> 00:13:53.799
TO A LIMIT OF BACKGROUND AND IN

00:13:53.866 --> 00:13:55.467
SOME COMMENT --

00:13:55.534 --> 00:13:56.769
I'LL BE SPEAKING FROM A HANDOUT

00:13:56.835 --> 00:13:57.703
THAT -- I I

00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:58.671
SHARED EARLIER.

00:13:58.737 --> 00:13:59.972
I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION GIVE

00:14:00.039 --> 00:14:01.674
A PRETTY GOOD OVERVIEW OF THE

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.475
BIG MOVING PIECES AND THIS THIS

00:14:03.542 --> 00:14:05.077
YEAR'S BUDGET.

00:14:05.144 --> 00:14:05.844
AND I THINK THEIR PRESENTATION

00:14:05.911 --> 00:14:07.379
WAS A TIMELY REMINDER THAT

00:14:07.446 --> 00:14:09.048
YOU'VE GOT NEARLY A DOZEN INPUTS

00:14:09.114 --> 00:14:09.782
THAT AFFECT THE MINIMUM

00:14:09.848 --> 00:14:11.083
GUARANTEE.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:11.884
THE THREE MOST IMPORTANT I

00:14:11.951 --> 00:14:13.485
GROWTH IN GENERAL FUND REVENUE

00:14:13.552 --> 00:14:15.120
CHANGES IN STUDENT ATTENDANCE

00:14:15.187 --> 00:14:16.822
AND CHANGES IN THE STATE ECONOMY.

00:14:16.889 --> 00:14:18.457
AND EVERY YEAR THOSE FACTORS

00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:19.825
TAKE ON KIND OF VARYING LEVELS

00:14:19.892 --> 00:14:21.660
OF IMPORTANT SOMETIMES GROWTH IN

00:14:21.727 --> 00:14:22.261
GENERAL FUND REVENUE IS MORE

00:14:22.328 --> 00:14:26.432
IMPORTANT SOMETIMES THE CHANGES

00:14:26.498 --> 00:14:27.032
IN STUDENT ATTENDANCE AND MORE

00:14:27.099 --> 00:14:28.200
IMPORTANT.

00:14:28.267 --> 00:14:30.135
A FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TURNING

00:14:30.202 --> 00:14:30.903
TO PAGE.

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:31.604
ONE THE ADMINISTRATION SAY IS

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.005
THAT.

00:14:33.072 --> 00:14:34.506
IN THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET

00:14:34.573 --> 00:14:35.741
ACT THE STATE THAT SCHOOL

00:14:35.808 --> 00:14:37.276
FUNDING EQUAL TO TO ITS ESTIMATE

00:14:37.343 --> 00:14:38.677
OF THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE AT THAT

00:14:38.744 --> 00:14:39.578
TIME.

00:14:39.645 --> 00:14:40.646
SINCE THEN WE'VE REVISED OUR

00:14:40.713 --> 00:14:43.249
ESTIMATES OF THE NOW SCHOOL

00:14:43.315 --> 00:14:44.883
FUNDING IS FOUR HUNDRED AND

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:45.484
SEVENTY FIVE MILLION ABOVE THE

00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:46.285
GUARANTEE.

00:14:46.352 --> 00:14:47.519
SO WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS

00:14:47.586 --> 00:14:49.154
PROPOSING TO DO IS TO LET

00:14:49.221 --> 00:14:50.823
SCHOOLS RETAIN ALL OF THAT MONEY

00:14:50.889 --> 00:14:52.358
I DON'T TO CUTS DOWN TO

00:14:52.424 --> 00:14:52.825
DEFERRALS.

00:14:52.891 --> 00:14:55.027
ABOUT ON PAPER WE CLASSIFY IT AS

00:14:55.094 --> 00:14:57.029
BEING A PAYMENT TOWARD SOME

00:14:57.096 --> 00:14:58.464
PRIOR YEAR IS.

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.266
AND THAT'S A KIND OF SIGNIFICANT

00:15:00.332 --> 00:15:02.001
BECAUSE IT ONE AT LET'S TO AVOID

00:15:02.067 --> 00:15:04.169
NY KIND OF IMMEDIATE YOUR TRUMP

00:15:04.236 --> 00:15:05.404
DISRUPTION ON SCHOOL BUDGETS.

00:15:05.471 --> 00:15:08.173
BUT IT ALSO ALLOWS THE STATE TO

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.009
BUILD ON NEXT YEAR'S MINIMUM

00:15:10.075 --> 00:15:11.543
GUARANTEE ON THAT LOWER FACE

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:13.045
WHAT THE GUARANTEE ACTUALLY WAS

00:15:13.112 --> 00:15:14.780
NOT THE HIGHER LEVEL OF FUNDING

00:15:14.847 --> 00:15:15.948
SCHOOLS ACTUALLY RECEIVED.

00:15:16.015 --> 00:15:16.949
AND SO IT'S KIND OF A

00:15:17.016 --> 00:15:19.218
SIGNIFICANT DECISION FOR YOUR

00:15:19.285 --> 00:15:22.421
OUT YOUR BUDGET CALCULATIONS.

00:15:22.488 --> 00:15:23.989
TURNING TO PAGE TWO AS THE

00:15:24.056 --> 00:15:25.324
ADMINISTRATION TOLD YOU THE

00:15:25.391 --> 00:15:27.092
GUARANTEE IS GOING THREE POINT

00:15:27.159 --> 00:15:29.395
6% IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND TO THE

00:15:29.461 --> 00:15:30.529
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET.

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:32.898
AND YOU PROBABLY RECOGNIZE THAT.

00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:34.433
AS BEING A BIT LOWER THAN IN

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.568
SOME PREVIOUS YEAR IS --

00:15:36.635 --> 00:15:38.304
A LOT OF THAT A PREVIOUS GROWTH

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:39.905
WAS FUELED BY THIS

00:15:39.972 --> 00:15:41.240
CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT WE

00:15:41.307 --> 00:15:42.508
CALL MAINTENANCE FACTOR THIS WAS

00:15:42.574 --> 00:15:44.943
SOMETHING ADDED BY PROPOSITION --

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:45.811
ONE ELEVEN IT'S AND IT'S THAT

00:15:45.878 --> 00:15:48.480
MECHANISM FOR LETTING THE STATE

00:15:48.547 --> 00:15:49.715
AND PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT LESS

00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:51.016
FOR SCHOOLS DURING TAKE TIME IS

00:15:51.083 --> 00:15:53.752
AN EXCHANGE FOR GROWING FUNDING

00:15:53.819 --> 00:15:56.422
WILL QUICKLY DURING GOOD TIMES --

00:15:56.488 --> 00:15:57.890
THE STATE HAS NO OF PAID OFF ALL

00:15:57.956 --> 00:15:59.291
OF THAT MAINTENANCE FACTOR AND

00:15:59.358 --> 00:16:01.327
SO THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE.

00:16:01.393 --> 00:16:01.894
RESULTING IN SCHOOL FUNDING

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.430
GOING AS QUICKLY AS IT HAS A SAY

00:16:04.496 --> 00:16:07.099
OVER THE PAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS --

00:16:07.166 --> 00:16:08.133
I THINK THIS YEAR'S BUDGET

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.501
PROBABLY GIVES YOU A GOOD FLAVOR

00:16:09.568 --> 00:16:10.602
OF WHAT THAT GROWTH WILL LOOK

00:16:10.669 --> 00:16:11.170
LIKE.

00:16:11.236 --> 00:16:12.604
ASK FOR SOMETHING MORE IN THE

00:16:12.671 --> 00:16:14.973
RANGE OF 324% PER YEAR RATHER

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.444
THAN FACE 6527% OF THE PAST

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:20.946
COUPLE YEARS --

00:16:21.013 --> 00:16:22.348
THE ADMINISTRATION DIDN'T TALK

00:16:22.414 --> 00:16:24.183
ABOUT PROPERTY TAX REVENUE BUT

00:16:24.249 --> 00:16:25.551
IN THE PAST THAT SOME TIME HAS

00:16:25.617 --> 00:16:27.252
BEEN AN AREA WHERE WE HAVE

00:16:27.319 --> 00:16:28.754
DIFFERENT ESTIMATES --

00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:30.322
BUT THIS YEAR ARE ESTIMATES OF

00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:31.890
LOCAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUE I

00:16:31.957 --> 00:16:33.392
VERY VERY CLOSE.

00:16:33.459 --> 00:16:36.829
AND THAT'S SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE

00:16:36.895 --> 00:16:38.364
NEW OFTEN REDUCES --

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:39.598
HOW MUCH THE STATE HAS TO

00:16:39.665 --> 00:16:40.933
PROVIDE FOR THE GENERAL FUND TO

00:16:40.999 --> 00:16:42.134
MEET THE PROPOSITION NINETY

00:16:42.201 --> 00:16:43.168
EIGHT MINIMUM GUARANTEE AND STAR

00:16:43.235 --> 00:16:44.937
ESTIMATES THIS YEAR ACROSS THE

00:16:45.003 --> 00:16:47.072
THREE YEAR PERIOD A VERY CLOSE?

00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:47.639
ONLY ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION

00:16:47.706 --> 00:16:51.510
DIFFERENT --

00:16:51.577 --> 00:16:54.279
PAGE THREE IS A SHOWING YOU.

00:16:54.346 --> 00:16:55.714
WHAT THE PROPOSITION NINETY

00:16:55.781 --> 00:16:56.715
EIGHT GUARANTEE HAS MEANT FOR

00:16:56.782 --> 00:17:00.018
PER PUPIL FUNDING SINCE

00:17:00.085 --> 00:17:00.319
[inaudible]

00:17:00.386 --> 00:17:01.353
NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT SO.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.021
THIS IN NINETEEN TWENTY UNDER

00:17:03.088 --> 00:17:04.256
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FUNDING

00:17:04.323 --> 00:17:05.858
PER STUDENT WOULD BE TWELVE

00:17:05.924 --> 00:17:07.159
THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN DOLLARS.

00:17:07.226 --> 00:17:08.894
THAT IS AN ALL TIME HIGH EVEN

00:17:08.961 --> 00:17:10.496
ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION --

00:17:10.562 --> 00:17:12.030
BUT MIGHT NOT BE AS MUCH OF A

00:17:12.097 --> 00:17:14.700
SURPRISE GIVEN THE LONG ECONOMIC

00:17:14.767 --> 00:17:15.834
RECOVERY THAT WE'RE IN WE'RE

00:17:15.901 --> 00:17:17.536
JUST THREE MONTHS NOW SHY OF THE

00:17:17.603 --> 00:17:19.505
LONGEST ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN US

00:17:19.571 --> 00:17:20.639
HISTORY.

00:17:20.706 --> 00:17:22.241
AND THAT A STRONG GROWTH IN THE

00:17:22.307 --> 00:17:24.309
ECONOMY STRONG GROWTH IN REVENUE

00:17:24.376 --> 00:17:25.944
HAS PUSH THESE PROPOSITION

00:17:26.011 --> 00:17:28.847
NINETY EIGHT FORMULAS AND PULLED

00:17:28.914 --> 00:17:30.916
THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE UP UPWARD

00:17:30.983 --> 00:17:35.487
ALONG THAT SAME TRAJECTORY.

00:17:35.554 --> 00:17:37.523
LOOKING UP BEYOND THE BUDGET

00:17:37.589 --> 00:17:38.524
YEAR I MENTIONED ON THE TRAIN TO

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:39.958
PAGE FOUR I THINK I MENTIONED

00:17:40.025 --> 00:17:40.959
SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE READY

00:17:41.026 --> 00:17:43.228
BUT WE DID A FOR ABOUT. FOUR

00:17:43.295 --> 00:17:44.797
YEAR LOOK AHEAD AT THE MINIMUM

00:17:44.863 --> 00:17:46.465
GUARANTEE UNDER TWO DIFFERENT

00:17:46.532 --> 00:17:47.900
ECONOMIC SCENARIOS WE KNOW.

00:17:47.966 --> 00:17:49.334
THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE IS

00:17:49.401 --> 00:17:51.036
VOLATILE IT CHANGES A LOT AND WE

00:17:51.103 --> 00:17:52.771
WANTED TO GIVE KIND OF A A RANGE

00:17:52.838 --> 00:17:54.373
OF WHAT YOU MIGHT EXPECT THE

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.808
NEXT COUPLE YEARS.

00:17:55.874 --> 00:17:56.809
SO WHEN I GROWTH SCENARIO THE

00:17:56.875 --> 00:17:58.677
GUARANTEE WAS GROWING ROUGHLY IN

00:17:58.744 --> 00:18:01.980
THE RANGE OF THREE POINT 4% PER

00:18:02.047 --> 00:18:07.052
YEAR -- SEC --

00:18:07.119 --> 00:18:07.719
UNDER ARREST THE RECESSION

00:18:07.786 --> 00:18:08.921
SERIOUS NERIO WE MODELED WHICH

00:18:08.987 --> 00:18:10.088
WAS REALLY MODELING KIND OF LIKE

00:18:10.155 --> 00:18:11.356
WHAT A MODERATE RECESSION MIGHT

00:18:11.423 --> 00:18:11.824
MEAN FOR THE BUDGET.

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:12.958
I THE GUARANTEE ENDS UP DROPPING

00:18:13.025 --> 00:18:14.293
YEAR OVER YEAR SO UNDER THAT

00:18:14.359 --> 00:18:15.027
SCENARIO IT DROPPED ABOUT A

00:18:15.093 --> 00:18:17.463
BILLION DOLLARS IN.

00:18:17.529 --> 00:18:18.664
TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND ANOTHER

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:20.199
BILLION IN.

00:18:20.265 --> 00:18:20.766
TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SO THE

00:18:20.833 --> 00:18:21.500
GROWTH SCENARIO YOU'VE GOT

00:18:21.567 --> 00:18:23.402
ENOUGH MONEY TO COVER A COST OF

00:18:23.469 --> 00:18:24.970
LIVING ADJUSTMENT PERHAPS A FEW

00:18:25.037 --> 00:18:27.005
OTHER SMALLER PLANTATIONS.

00:18:27.072 --> 00:18:29.107
AND RECESSION SCENARIO AT THE

00:18:29.174 --> 00:18:32.044
GUARANTEE OFTEN TO A LEVEL WHERE

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:33.812
YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN

00:18:33.879 --> 00:18:35.948
YOUR EXISTING SCHOOL PROGRAMS.

00:18:36.014 --> 00:18:37.149
AND IN THE PAST THAT'S BEEN A

00:18:37.216 --> 00:18:38.517
CONCERN FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND

00:18:38.584 --> 00:18:39.985
AND AND FOR SOME OF THE SCHOOL

00:18:40.052 --> 00:18:41.220
GROUPS AS WELL --

00:18:41.286 --> 00:18:42.488
SO IF YOU DID WANT TO AVOID SOME

00:18:42.554 --> 00:18:43.822
THOSE REJECT MAKING SOME OF

00:18:43.889 --> 00:18:45.357
THOSE REDUCTIONS IN THE FUTURE

00:18:45.424 --> 00:18:47.693
WE THINK THAT'S PROBABLY A CASE

00:18:47.759 --> 00:18:48.694
FOR BUILDING SOMEWHERE RESERVE

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:49.461
THIS.

00:18:49.528 --> 00:18:50.696
EITHER IN YOUR STATE SCHOOL

00:18:50.762 --> 00:18:52.231
RESERVE YOUR MAIN RAINY DAY FUND

00:18:52.297 --> 00:18:53.632
ACCOUNT YOU'VE GOT DIFFERENT

00:18:53.699 --> 00:18:55.067
OPTIONS FOR BUILDING DESERVES.

00:18:55.133 --> 00:18:56.368
A RIGHT NOW THE STATE DOESN'T

00:18:56.435 --> 00:18:57.669
HAVE ANY MONEY THAT SPECIFICALLY

00:18:57.736 --> 00:18:59.471
SET ASIDE FOR SCHOOLS UNLIKE

00:18:59.538 --> 00:19:00.572
SOME OF THE OTHER AREAS OF THE

00:19:00.639 --> 00:19:03.008
BUDGET WE'VE CREATED RAINY DAY

00:19:03.075 --> 00:19:05.644
ACCOUNTS JUST FOR THEM.

00:19:05.711 --> 00:19:07.880
TURNING TO PAGE FIVE THIS IS

00:19:07.946 --> 00:19:09.882
REALLY SHOWING KIND OF OUR

00:19:09.948 --> 00:19:10.682
OUTLOOK FOR THE MINIMUM

00:19:10.749 --> 00:19:12.484
GUARANTEE THAT WE PUT TOGETHER

00:19:12.551 --> 00:19:14.520
BACK IN NOVEMBER.

00:19:14.586 --> 00:19:15.821
AND I THINK IT'S JUST.

00:19:15.888 --> 00:19:17.422
A REMINDER OF HOW QUICKLY THE

00:19:17.489 --> 00:19:18.957
PICTURE CAN CHANGE.

00:19:19.024 --> 00:19:20.025
SO.

00:19:20.092 --> 00:19:21.960
IF A RECESSION UNDER GROWTH

00:19:22.027 --> 00:19:23.161
SCENARIO --

00:19:23.228 --> 00:19:24.730
BY THE END OF THE FOUR YEAR

00:19:24.796 --> 00:19:26.231
PERIOD THE GUARANTEE WOULD BE

00:19:26.298 --> 00:19:27.799
NEARLY NINETY BILLION DOLLARS

00:19:27.866 --> 00:19:29.468
UNDER A SESSION SCENARIO WOULD

00:19:29.535 --> 00:19:30.869
BE MORE LIKE EIGHTY THREE

00:19:30.936 --> 00:19:31.970
BILLION DOLLARS SO YOU'VE GOT A

00:19:32.037 --> 00:19:34.840
SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR DIFFERENCE

00:19:34.907 --> 00:19:36.808
IN JUST A FEW YEARS BETWEEN.

00:19:36.875 --> 00:19:37.609
A GOOD ECONOMIC SCENARIO IN A

00:19:37.676 --> 00:19:40.946
PORT.

00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:41.847
ONE TURNING TO PAGE SIX THIS IS

00:19:41.914 --> 00:19:43.515
LARGELY JUSTER RECAP OF ALL OF

00:19:43.582 --> 00:19:44.816
THE PROPOSALS OF THE GOVERNOR

00:19:44.883 --> 00:19:46.184
HAS THIS YEAR I WON'T COVER ANY

00:19:46.251 --> 00:19:47.819
OF THESE IN DETAIL NOW YOU PUT

00:19:47.886 --> 00:19:49.421
ABOUT THE LAST WEEK AND YOU'LL

00:19:49.488 --> 00:19:49.955
HEAR ABOUT THEM AND FUTURE

00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:51.523
HEARING THIS --

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:53.458
I THINK AT COMPARED WITH

00:19:53.525 --> 00:19:54.726
PREVIOUS YEARS THIS IS REALLY

00:19:54.793 --> 00:19:55.627
ONE OF THE MOST STRAIGHTFORWARD

00:19:55.694 --> 00:19:56.695
BUDGETS YOU'RE EVER LIKELY TO

00:19:56.762 --> 00:19:58.397
SEE HOW THE GOVERNOR'S PUTTING

00:19:58.463 --> 00:19:59.731
NEARLY ALL OF THE AVAILABLE

00:19:59.798 --> 00:20:00.132
FUNDING --

00:20:00.198 --> 00:20:01.500
TOWARDS COVERING COST OF LIVING

00:20:01.567 --> 00:20:02.901
ADJUSTMENT AND JUST ONE OR TWO

00:20:02.968 --> 00:20:04.703
OTHER AUGMENTATIONS IN THE CAPE

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:07.739
OF AREA.

00:20:07.806 --> 00:20:09.374
TURN TO PAGE SEVEN I THINK MAYBE

00:20:09.441 --> 00:20:10.976
THE MOST NOTABLE DIFFERENCE FROM

00:20:11.043 --> 00:20:12.177
PREVIOUS YEAR IS.

00:20:12.244 --> 00:20:13.612
IS THE MIX OF ONE TIME AN ON

00:20:13.679 --> 00:20:15.447
GOING FUNDING --

00:20:15.514 --> 00:20:18.684
HISTORICALLY. FOR THE PAST SIXTY

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.018
SET ASIDE SOME FUNDING IN THE

00:20:20.085 --> 00:20:22.254
GUARANTEE EACH YEAR FOR ONE TIME

00:20:22.321 --> 00:20:23.088
ACTIVITY IS.

00:20:23.155 --> 00:20:24.590
AT THAT'S AVERAGE PARADE A LOT

00:20:24.656 --> 00:20:25.991
BUT IT'S AVERAGE ABOUT SEVEN

00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:27.459
HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR.

00:20:27.526 --> 00:20:29.728
AND THAT APPOACH HAS KIND OF

00:20:29.795 --> 00:20:30.829
BEEN AN INTENTIONAL CHOICE

00:20:30.896 --> 00:20:32.497
BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE

00:20:32.564 --> 00:20:33.398
TIME FUNDING BUILT INTO THE

00:20:33.465 --> 00:20:34.866
BUDGET YOU'RE GIVING YOURSELF A

00:20:34.933 --> 00:20:36.501
LITTLE BIT OF A CUSHION AGAINST

00:20:36.568 --> 00:20:37.803
FUTURE VOLATILITY IN THE MINIMUM

00:20:37.869 --> 00:20:39.037
GUARANTEE.

00:20:39.104 --> 00:20:40.806
IF THE GUARANTEE DROPS NEXT YEAR

00:20:40.872 --> 00:20:41.907
YOU CAN JUST LET THAT ONE TIME

00:20:41.974 --> 00:20:43.408
FUNDING EXPIRE YOU DON'T HAVE TO

00:20:43.475 --> 00:20:45.043
MAKE CHANGES TO ONGOING PROGRAMS

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:47.412
ARE THINGS THAT SCHOOLS ARE

00:20:47.479 --> 00:20:49.014
GOING TO FIND MORE DISRUPTIVE.

00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:49.815
THIS YEAR --

00:20:49.881 --> 00:20:51.483
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:53.185
VERY LITTLE IN ONE TIME FUNDING --

00:20:53.251 --> 00:20:54.620
IN NINETEEN TWENTY JUST THREE

00:20:54.686 --> 00:20:56.121
MILLION OF HIS NINETEEN TWENTY

00:20:56.188 --> 00:20:57.255
SPENDING LEVELS FOR ONE TIME

00:20:57.322 --> 00:20:59.358
ACTIVITY IS --

00:20:59.424 --> 00:21:01.293
ON TOP OF THAT THIS BUDGET ALSO

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.061
PROPOSES USING SEVENTY SEVEN

00:21:03.128 --> 00:21:05.864
MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDS TO PAY

00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:08.000
FOR SOME ONGOING PROGRAM COSTS.

00:21:08.066 --> 00:21:08.934
AND THAT SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE

00:21:09.001 --> 00:21:10.736
THIS IS A ONE TIME FUNDS TO PAY

00:21:10.802 --> 00:21:12.004
FOR ONGOING ACTIVITIES BUILD IN

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:13.205
A LITTLE BIT OF A SHORTFALL NEXT

00:21:13.271 --> 00:21:14.840
YEAR IT'S SOMETHING YOU HAVE

00:21:14.906 --> 00:21:15.474
IT'S KIND OF THE FIRST CALL IN

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:16.775
YOUR DOLLAR. FOR NEXT YEAR'S

00:21:16.842 --> 00:21:18.910
BUDGET.

00:21:18.977 --> 00:21:20.278
AND IT COULD MAKE THINGS.

00:21:20.345 --> 00:21:21.613
REDUCES THE FOR INCREASES THAT

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.548
SCHOOLS MIGHT EXPECT MIGHT

00:21:23.615 --> 00:21:25.684
RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING YEAR.

00:21:25.751 --> 00:21:26.885
AND SO THIS IS A LITTLE OF A

00:21:26.952 --> 00:21:28.520
RISKIER APPROACH COMPARED TO

00:21:28.587 --> 00:21:29.855
SOME PREVIOUS BUDGET SEN --

00:21:29.921 --> 00:21:30.889
PROBABLY WHAT WE THINK OF AS THE

00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:33.091
MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN TERMS

00:21:33.158 --> 00:21:34.960
OF THE WAY THE WHOLE PROPOSITION

00:21:35.027 --> 00:21:39.831
NINETY EIGHT PACKAGES STRUCTURED.

00:21:39.898 --> 00:21:42.000
US ARE TURNING TO PAGE.

00:21:42.067 --> 00:21:42.768
EIGHT I'LL JUST HAVE TO LITTLE

00:21:42.834 --> 00:21:45.203
BIT AM FROM KIND OF THE WAY WE

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:46.772
WERE IN JANUARY TWO WHERE HOW

00:21:46.838 --> 00:21:49.374
THINGS MIGHT INVOLVE COME MAY.

00:21:49.441 --> 00:21:50.942
AND ON BALANCE WE THINK THAT

00:21:51.009 --> 00:21:52.711
THERE'S A BIT MORE DOWNSIDE IS

00:21:52.778 --> 00:21:54.579
AN UPSIDE AS FAR AS POSSIBLE

00:21:54.646 --> 00:21:55.647
CHANGES IN THE PROPOSITION

00:21:55.714 --> 00:21:57.115
NINETY EIGHT BUDGET.

00:21:57.182 --> 00:21:58.750
A PART OF THAT STORY HAS TO DO

00:21:58.817 --> 00:21:59.551
WITH REVENUE.

00:21:59.618 --> 00:22:01.753
OF THE STOCK MARKET DROPPING

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.689
NOTABLY AT THE END OF TWENTY

00:22:03.755 --> 00:22:05.557
EIGHTEEN AT AFTER THE

00:22:05.624 --> 00:22:06.958
ADMINISTRATIONOF LOCKED DOWN

00:22:07.025 --> 00:22:08.527
ITS ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS.

00:22:08.593 --> 00:22:09.494
IT'S MADE UP A LOT OF GROUND

00:22:09.561 --> 00:22:11.463
SINCE THEN BUT WE STILL THINK

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:13.198
THERE COULD BE --

00:22:13.265 --> 00:22:14.533
LOWER REVENUE AND INTO THE

00:22:14.599 --> 00:22:16.368
CURRENT YEAR COMPARED TO THE

00:22:16.435 --> 00:22:17.736
JANUARY ESTIMATES.

00:22:17.803 --> 00:22:19.404
AND WE'VE ALSO SEEN SOME SIGNS

00:22:19.471 --> 00:22:20.605
THAT THE ECONOMY MIGHT BE

00:22:20.672 --> 00:22:21.807
SLOWING JUST ATTACH --

00:22:21.873 --> 00:22:23.408
INCLUDING A SMALL UPTICK IN

00:22:23.475 --> 00:22:25.544
UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS AND A SMALL

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:27.879
DOWN TAKE AND HOME SALES.

00:22:27.946 --> 00:22:29.915
AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS

00:22:29.981 --> 00:22:31.016
YOU HEARD EARLIER THE MINIMUM

00:22:31.083 --> 00:22:32.184
GUARANTEE IS SENSITIVE TO

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:34.086
CHANGES IN REVENUE. FOR EACH

00:22:34.152 --> 00:22:35.120
DOLLAR OF LOWER REVENUE WILL

00:22:35.187 --> 00:22:38.657
DROP ABOUT FIFTY FIVE CENTS IN

00:22:38.724 --> 00:22:39.157
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FORTY

00:22:39.224 --> 00:22:40.759
SOMETHING DOLLARS IN.

00:22:40.826 --> 00:22:41.326
NINETEEN TWENTY AT THE OTHER

00:22:41.393 --> 00:22:42.527
PART OF THE STORY IS FOR THE

00:22:42.594 --> 00:22:44.162
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TO EXCLUDE

00:22:44.229 --> 00:22:45.597
SOME COSTS THAT WE THINK --

00:22:45.664 --> 00:22:46.198
ARE VERY LIKELY TO MATERIALIZE

00:22:46.264 --> 00:22:48.433
IN THE COMING.

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.469
THE BIGGEST ISSUE IS A ONE TIME

00:22:50.535 --> 00:22:51.903
PROPERTY TAX BACK FILL IN SAN

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:53.905
FRANCISCO COUNTY I RELATED TO

00:22:53.972 --> 00:22:55.373
KIND OF AN INCORRECT ALLOCATION

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.742
THAT OCCURRED IN THE COUNTY

00:22:56.808 --> 00:22:58.176
PREVIOUSLY.

00:22:58.243 --> 00:22:59.144
WE ALSO THINK THAT SOME OF YOUR

00:22:59.211 --> 00:23:00.879
FORMULA DRIVEN SPENDING IS GOING

00:23:00.946 --> 00:23:01.813
TO BE HIGHER THAN.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.148
WHAT SYSTEM IN THE GOVERNOR'S

00:23:03.215 --> 00:23:04.082
BUDGET?

00:23:04.149 --> 00:23:05.117
THAT INCLUDES --

00:23:05.183 --> 00:23:06.551
SOME COSTS FOR COUNTY OFFICES OF

00:23:06.618 --> 00:23:08.520
EDUCATION COMMUNITY COLLEGE A

00:23:08.587 --> 00:23:09.588
QUESTION.

00:23:09.654 --> 00:23:12.591
AND YOUR ATTENDANCE DRIVEN COSTS

00:23:12.657 --> 00:23:13.191
FOR THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING

00:23:13.258 --> 00:23:14.059
FORMULA.

00:23:14.126 --> 00:23:15.961
AND SO BETWEEN THE LOWER

00:23:16.027 --> 00:23:17.729
GUARANTEE AND HIGHER COSTS WE

00:23:17.796 --> 00:23:19.831
THINK YOU MIGHT BE LOOKING AT

00:23:19.898 --> 00:23:21.199
KIND OF A COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION

00:23:21.266 --> 00:23:23.068
IN ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT WOULD

00:23:23.135 --> 00:23:24.102
MAKE YOUR PROPOSITION NINETY

00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:24.803
EIGHT BUDGET.

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:26.505
A TIGER BY THE TIME OF THE MAY

00:23:26.571 --> 00:23:27.973
REVISION.

00:23:28.039 --> 00:23:30.642
A TURNING TO PAGE NINE AS FAR AS

00:23:30.709 --> 00:23:32.377
KIND OF PREPARING FOR THAT AND

00:23:32.444 --> 00:23:34.146
HOW YOU MIGHT RESPOND --

00:23:34.212 --> 00:23:35.480
I THINK THE NEXT.

00:23:35.547 --> 00:23:36.581
COUPLE HEARINGS WILL GIVE YOU A

00:23:36.648 --> 00:23:38.216
CHANCE TO THINK THROUGH ALL OF

00:23:38.283 --> 00:23:39.518
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS.

00:23:39.584 --> 00:23:41.153
BUT WHEN I THINK ABOUT.

00:23:41.219 --> 00:23:42.053
WHAT YOU'RE HIGHEST PRIORITIES

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:43.655
ARE THINGS YOU MIGHT BE WILLING

00:23:43.722 --> 00:23:45.323
TO REJECT OR REDUCE IF THE

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:48.059
BUDGET IS TIGHTER SENT THAT

00:23:48.126 --> 00:23:48.627
MIGHT BE THE DECISION YOU'RE

00:23:48.693 --> 00:23:49.361
FACING IN MAY?

00:23:49.427 --> 00:23:50.262
YOU MIGHT ALSO THINK ABOUT

00:23:50.328 --> 00:23:51.296
BUILDING A BIT LITTLE BIT MORE

00:23:51.363 --> 00:23:52.798
OF A BUDGET QUESTION BY

00:23:52.864 --> 00:23:53.765
REPLACING SOME OF THE GOVERNOR

00:23:53.832 --> 00:23:56.301
IS A PROPOSED ONGOING SPENDING

00:23:56.368 --> 00:23:57.269
WITH ONE TIME INITIATIVE THIS.

00:23:57.335 --> 00:23:58.570
JUST MUCH EASIER TO KIND OF PULL

00:23:58.637 --> 00:24:00.238
BACK ON THE ONE TIME THEN THE ON

00:24:00.305 --> 00:24:02.607
GOING IF THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO

00:24:02.674 --> 00:24:03.208
DO THE BALANCE THE BUDGET AND

00:24:03.275 --> 00:24:06.444
MAY.

00:24:06.511 --> 00:24:07.679
A SO FINALLY TRYING TO PAGE TEN

00:24:07.746 --> 00:24:09.281
I'LL TALK JUST A LITTLE BIT

00:24:09.347 --> 00:24:10.482
ABOUT THE TRIP PROCESS

00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:10.782
[inaudible]

00:24:10.849 --> 00:24:15.320
AND THIS IS AS THE

00:24:15.387 --> 00:24:16.421
ADMINISTRATION TOLD YOU REALLY

00:24:16.488 --> 00:24:17.455
ABOUT THE WAY THE STATE

00:24:17.522 --> 00:24:19.124
ADDRESSES THE GUARANTEE AFTER

00:24:19.191 --> 00:24:20.692
THE YEAR IS OVER THIS IS KIND OF

00:24:20.759 --> 00:24:22.027
A UNIQUE FEATURE OF THE

00:24:22.093 --> 00:24:23.328
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT BUDGET.

00:24:23.395 --> 00:24:24.529
AND ALMOST ALL OTHER PARTS OF

00:24:24.596 --> 00:24:25.363
YOUR BUDGET YOU'RE NOT MAKING

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:26.498
CHANGES ONCE THE FISCAL YEAR IS

00:24:26.565 --> 00:24:27.465
OVER.

00:24:27.532 --> 00:24:29.534
BUT THESE PROPOSITION NINETY

00:24:29.601 --> 00:24:30.101
EIGHT FORMULAS CONTINUE TO

00:24:30.168 --> 00:24:31.236
CHANGE.

00:24:31.303 --> 00:24:32.804
AS AS LONG AS NINE MONTHS AFTER

00:24:32.871 --> 00:24:35.006
THE YEAR IS OVER AND SOMETIMES

00:24:35.073 --> 00:24:37.209
EVEN LONGER THAN THAT

00:24:37.275 --> 00:24:37.509
[inaudible]

00:24:37.576 --> 00:24:39.244
AT TRADITIONALLY.

00:24:39.311 --> 00:24:40.579
THOSE CHANGES ARE IN THE RANGE

00:24:40.645 --> 00:24:42.280
OF SAY TENS OF MILLIONS TO A FEW

00:24:42.347 --> 00:24:43.682
HUNDREDS MILLION HUNDREDS OF

00:24:43.748 --> 00:24:44.749
MILLIONS --

00:24:44.816 --> 00:24:45.984
SO THEY CAN BE SIGNIFICANT

00:24:46.051 --> 00:24:47.419
PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE IN A

00:24:47.485 --> 00:24:49.054
TIGHTER AND TIGHTER BUDGET

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.355
SITUATION.

00:24:50.422 --> 00:24:52.023
USUALLY WHEN THE GUARANTEE IS

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:54.159
HIGHER THAN WHAT THE STATE

00:24:54.226 --> 00:24:55.694
ESTIMATED PREVIOUSLY ARE THE

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.395
STATE MAKES THE ONE TIME PAYMENT

00:24:57.462 --> 00:24:58.730
TO WHAT WE CALL SETTLE UP TO

00:24:58.797 --> 00:25:00.999
THAT HIGHER FUNDING LEVEL.

00:25:01.066 --> 00:25:02.367
WHEN THEY GET YOUR IN TEA IS

00:25:02.434 --> 00:25:04.035
LOWER THAN THE STATE ESTIMATED

00:25:04.102 --> 00:25:05.904
PREVIOUSLY WHAT WE USUALLY DO IS

00:25:05.971 --> 00:25:07.239
TAKE THAT FUNDING ABOUT THE

00:25:07.305 --> 00:25:08.807
GUARANTEE AND WE CLASSIFY IT TO

00:25:08.874 --> 00:25:10.642
BECOME IT TOWARD THE PRIOR YEAR

00:25:10.709 --> 00:25:12.711
OR SOME OTHER YEAR WE HAVEN'T

00:25:12.777 --> 00:25:13.211
ALREADY MET THE MINIMUM

00:25:13.278 --> 00:25:13.845
GUARANTEE?

00:25:13.912 --> 00:25:15.080
AT THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE

00:25:15.146 --> 00:25:17.782
ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING.

00:25:17.849 --> 00:25:18.416
FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND IT'S

00:25:18.483 --> 00:25:19.885
OUT WE DO IT BECAUSE WE WANT

00:25:19.951 --> 00:25:21.286
SCHOOLS TO KEEP THE CASH THEY'VE

00:25:21.353 --> 00:25:22.721
ALREADY RECEIVED BUT WE DON'T

00:25:22.787 --> 00:25:24.122
WANT THAT HIGHER FUNDING TO BE

00:25:24.189 --> 00:25:26.491
THE BASE FOR CALCULATING NEXT

00:25:26.558 --> 00:25:28.293
YEAR SCHOOL FUNDING APPLICATION

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:28.593
[inaudible]

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:31.529
AT THE GOVERNOR EIGHTEEN

00:25:31.596 --> 00:25:32.364
NINETEEN BUDGET PACKAGE

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:34.933
ESSENTIALLY PROPOSED AUTOMATING

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.701
THOSE ADJUSTMENTS.

00:25:36.768 --> 00:25:37.369
DIRECTLY WE HAD DONE THEM COME

00:25:37.435 --> 00:25:38.937
ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS TO

00:25:39.004 --> 00:25:40.639
TRAILER LEGISLATION LAST YEAR'S

00:25:40.705 --> 00:25:41.473
BUDGET PACKAGE WOULD HAVE JUST

00:25:41.539 --> 00:25:43.008
DIRECTED THE ADMINISTRATION TO

00:25:43.074 --> 00:25:43.742
DO THM.

00:25:43.808 --> 00:25:45.143
AND IT AUTOMATICALLY UNLESS THE

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:46.278
LEGISLATURE MADE A DIFFERENT

00:25:46.344 --> 00:25:47.846
DECISION.

00:25:47.913 --> 00:25:49.514
AND THAT WAS DESIGNED TO MAKE

00:25:49.581 --> 00:25:51.216
CHANGES IN THE GUARANTEE A

00:25:51.283 --> 00:25:52.784
LITTLE BIT LESS DISRUPTIVE FOR

00:25:52.851 --> 00:25:55.186
SCHOOLS AS WELL AS THE REST OF

00:25:55.253 --> 00:25:56.988
THE STATE BUDGET.

00:25:57.055 --> 00:25:57.989
AFTER TURNING TO PAGE ELEVEN THE

00:25:58.056 --> 00:25:59.124
PROPOSAL'S ESSENTIALLY.

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:00.725
AS KIND OF TWO INTERRELATED

00:26:00.792 --> 00:26:01.927
PROPOSALS.

00:26:01.993 --> 00:26:03.128
OUT ONE IS TO NOT DO THE

00:26:03.194 --> 00:26:07.065
AUTOMATIC AND THE OTHER IS TO

00:26:07.132 --> 00:26:08.166
PROHIBIT THE STATE FROM MAKING

00:26:08.233 --> 00:26:09.968
DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENTS TO SCHOOL

00:26:10.035 --> 00:26:12.370
FUNDING IN THE PRIOR YEAR WHILE

00:26:12.437 --> 00:26:12.938
STILL REQUIRING OPERATE JUST

00:26:13.004 --> 00:26:13.738
MEANT.

00:26:13.805 --> 00:26:15.440
AND I THINK IN ANALYZING THIS

00:26:15.507 --> 00:26:17.709
PROPOSAL WE IDENTIFIED SOME OF

00:26:17.776 --> 00:26:18.677
THE SAME CONCERNS THAT YOU REYES

00:26:18.743 --> 00:26:19.844
MISTER CHAIR.

00:26:19.911 --> 00:26:21.379
WHICH HAD TO DO WITH KIND OF

00:26:21.446 --> 00:26:22.781
WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THE REST OF

00:26:22.847 --> 00:26:23.915
YOUR STATE BUDGET.

00:26:23.982 --> 00:26:25.183
IF YOU WERE TO ADOPT THE

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:26.718
ADMINISTRATION PROPOSALS WE

00:26:26.785 --> 00:26:27.819
THINK YOU WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE

00:26:27.886 --> 00:26:29.554
COMMITTING TO HAVING ANY DROPS

00:26:29.621 --> 00:26:32.057
IN STATE REVENUE FALL ON THE

00:26:32.123 --> 00:26:33.959
ENTIRELY ON THE NONPROFIT THIS

00:26:34.025 --> 00:26:35.327
NINETY EIGHT SIDE OF YOUR BUDGET.

00:26:35.393 --> 00:26:36.294
AND THAT'S GONNA MAKE YOUR

00:26:36.361 --> 00:26:37.462
OVERALL BUDGET BALLENGER

00:26:37.529 --> 00:26:39.864
BALANCING TASK LITTLE BIT MORE

00:26:39.931 --> 00:26:41.333
DIFFICULT --

00:26:41.399 --> 00:26:42.100
BOTH IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND

00:26:42.167 --> 00:26:44.836
POTENTIALLY IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS.

00:26:44.903 --> 00:26:46.705
TO AND SO WHAT WE RECOMMEND IS

00:26:46.771 --> 00:26:48.039
THAT YOU REJECT BOTH OF THOSE

00:26:48.106 --> 00:26:51.176
PROPOSALS AND MAINTAIN --

00:26:51.242 --> 00:26:52.911
THE THE NEW PROCEDURES YOU PUT

00:26:52.978 --> 00:26:54.112
IN PLACE LAST YEAR WE THINK

00:26:54.179 --> 00:26:55.547
THOSE WERE OUT A CLEAR STEP

00:26:55.613 --> 00:26:58.316
FORWARD AND I GIVE THOSE LITTLE

00:26:58.383 --> 00:26:59.884
THE CHANCE.

00:26:59.951 --> 00:27:00.518
TO WORK AT THE LEGISLATURE

00:27:00.585 --> 00:27:01.419
APPROVED THEM.

00:27:01.486 --> 00:27:03.088
SO WITH THAT HAPPY TO TAKE ANY

00:27:03.154 --> 00:27:05.190
QUESTIONS.

00:27:05.256 --> 00:27:06.591
WERE YOU MENTION THIS.

00:27:06.658 --> 00:27:07.993
A STATE SCHOOL RESERVE

00:27:08.059 --> 00:27:09.260
ACCOUNTANT.

00:27:09.327 --> 00:27:10.695
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT

00:27:10.762 --> 00:27:12.764
CONCEPT WE DO HAVE THAT CONCEPT

00:27:12.831 --> 00:27:16.334
UNDER WHAT PROP [inaudible] TWO

00:27:16.401 --> 00:27:17.669
BUT TO THE CONDITIONS FOR

00:27:17.736 --> 00:27:19.437
MANDATORY FUNDING OF THE RESERVE

00:27:19.504 --> 00:27:21.206
ACCOUNT HAVE NOT OCCURRED.

00:27:21.272 --> 00:27:23.608
GIVEN THAT WHAT WHAT MECHANISM

00:27:23.675 --> 00:27:25.510
WOULD WE USED TO TO FUND THE

00:27:25.577 --> 00:27:26.978
STATE RESERVE ACCOUNT AYE THE

00:27:27.045 --> 00:27:28.546
FOREIGN SEVENTY FIVE MILLION

00:27:28.613 --> 00:27:31.282
ASSUME --

00:27:31.349 --> 00:27:33.485
COULD THAT BE USED TO FUND THE

00:27:33.551 --> 00:27:35.053
STATE RESERVE ACCOUNT I REALIZED

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:36.654
AMBIENT THERE WOULD BE AN IMPACT

00:27:36.721 --> 00:27:40.225
POTENTIALLY ON ON THE LA A IS.

00:27:40.291 --> 00:27:41.426
YEAH IF YOU WERE TO USE THE FORD

00:27:41.493 --> 00:27:43.161
IN SEVENTY FIVE MILLION YOU HAVE

00:27:43.228 --> 00:27:44.629
TO MAKE SOME KIND OF REAL

00:27:44.696 --> 00:27:46.031
REDUCTION TO SCHOOLS NOT GIVE

00:27:46.097 --> 00:27:47.832
THEM AS MUCH CASH AS THEY WERE

00:27:47.899 --> 00:27:48.833
ANTICIPATING.

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:49.667
SINCE THE YEAR IS ALREADY

00:27:49.734 --> 00:27:51.102
STARTED THEY MIGHT FIND THAT A

00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:52.504
LITTLE BIT MORE DISRUPTIVE BUT

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:53.938
YOU COULD TAKE SOME OF THE MONEY

00:27:54.005 --> 00:27:55.940
THAT THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING

00:27:56.007 --> 00:27:57.108
FOR NEW PROPOSALS THIS YEAR.

00:27:57.175 --> 00:27:58.576
LIKE SAY THE SPECIAL EDUCATION

00:27:58.643 --> 00:28:00.111
PROPOSAL OR SOME OTHER PROPOSAL

00:28:00.178 --> 00:28:00.845
YOU WEREN'T INTERESTED IN

00:28:00.912 --> 00:28:03.515
FUNDING AND USE THAT TO MAKE --

00:28:03.581 --> 00:28:04.783
TO MAKE A DEPOSIT IN THIS IN A

00:28:04.849 --> 00:28:05.483
RESERVE.

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:06.384
AND YOU COULD DO THAT IN

00:28:06.451 --> 00:28:07.819
DIFFERENT WAYS YOU COULD MAKE AN

00:28:07.886 --> 00:28:09.154
OPTIONAL DEPOSIT IN THE STATE

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:10.221
SCHOOL RESERVE THE SAME WAY

00:28:10.288 --> 00:28:13.091
YOU'VE MADE OPTIONAL DEPOSITS IN

00:28:13.158 --> 00:28:14.459
THE REGULAR STATE RESERVE.

00:28:14.526 --> 00:28:15.727
IF YOU DON'T THINK THE FORMULAS

00:28:15.794 --> 00:28:16.361
FOR THE STATE SCHOOL RESERVE I

00:28:16.428 --> 00:28:17.595
QUITE RATES YOU COULD.

00:28:17.662 --> 00:28:19.197
CREATE A NEW STATE RESERVE THAT

00:28:19.264 --> 00:28:21.933
WOULD BE JUST FOR SCHOOLS.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.535
YOUCOULD ALSO THINK ABOUT IF

00:28:23.601 --> 00:28:25.103
YOU ARE WILLING TO USE SOME OF

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:26.571
THE STATE'S MAN RESERVE TO FUND

00:28:26.638 --> 00:28:27.739
SCHOOLS SO YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF

00:28:27.806 --> 00:28:29.107
OPTIONS THERE AND WE CAN HELP

00:28:29.174 --> 00:28:30.508
YOU AND IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN

00:28:30.575 --> 00:28:31.109
THAT HELP YOU KIND OF THINK

00:28:31.176 --> 00:28:32.444
THROUGH THE TRADE OFFS OF THOSE

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:32.744
DIFFERENT.

00:28:32.811 --> 00:28:34.479
OPTIONS WELL I'M SO HAVING NO

HEARD.

00:28:35.246 --> 00:28:37.982
YOU KNOW THIS.

00:28:38.049 --> 00:28:39.451
NOW FOR TWO HEARINGS.

00:28:39.517 --> 00:28:41.052
AND BEFORE I AM SOMEWHAT

00:28:41.119 --> 00:28:42.587
SENSITIVE TO THE BUDGETING

00:28:42.654 --> 00:28:44.355
ISSUES IN THE EDUCATION FIELD

00:28:44.422 --> 00:28:45.757
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO BUDGET FOR

00:28:45.824 --> 00:28:47.692
PROGRAMS AND YOUR THERE'S

00:28:47.759 --> 00:28:49.394
REVENUE UNCERTAINTY.

00:28:49.461 --> 00:28:51.629
WHETHER IT'S CASE YOU FOURTEEN

00:28:51.696 --> 00:28:52.997
OR A HIGHER HIGHER ED.

00:28:53.064 --> 00:28:55.834
AND HOW YOU LEVEL THAT OUT GIVEN

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:58.336
THE VOLATILITY OF OUR STATE

00:28:58.403 --> 00:28:59.337
REVENUE STREAM.

00:28:59.404 --> 00:29:01.806
AND THE WAY WE BUDGET --

00:29:01.873 --> 00:29:03.842
YEAR BY YEAR EVEN IF WE TAKE A

00:29:03.908 --> 00:29:06.177
MULTI YEAR LOOK AND LOOK BACK.

00:29:06.244 --> 00:29:08.279
AND THERE HAS TO BE A WAY TO

00:29:08.346 --> 00:29:10.915
STRUCTURE SOME SORT OF A RESERVE

00:29:10.982 --> 00:29:12.717
SYSTEM OR CUSHION.

00:29:12.784 --> 00:29:14.919
WHERE WE CAN --

00:29:14.986 --> 00:29:16.821
DID TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE

00:29:16.888 --> 00:29:18.823
VOLATILITY OF THE REVENUE.

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:20.425
YET ALLOWS THE SCHOOL WHETHER

00:29:20.492 --> 00:29:21.759
IT'S A K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOL

00:29:21.826 --> 00:29:23.361
DISTRICT TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:29:23.428 --> 00:29:25.296
DISTRICT OR LET OR DISTRICT OR

00:29:25.363 --> 00:29:27.932
LAST WEEK WEEKS HIGHER EDUCATION

00:29:27.999 --> 00:29:28.900
FOLKS.

00:29:28.967 --> 00:29:31.436
THE FLEXIBILITY TO PLAN PROGRAMS

00:29:31.503 --> 00:29:33.037
HIGHER FACULTY.

00:29:33.104 --> 00:29:34.973
ARE TEACHERS STEP WHICH PROGRAMS

00:29:35.039 --> 00:29:37.909
AND NOT HAVE TO DEAL WITH A MID

00:29:37.976 --> 00:29:39.344
COURSE CORRECTION

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:41.579
NOW I REALIZE THAT'S WHAT THE

00:29:41.646 --> 00:29:42.113
FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:44.182
MILLION IS TO ALLOW THEM TO DO

00:29:44.249 --> 00:29:46.918
THAT BUT THERE'S GOT TO BE A

00:29:46.985 --> 00:29:48.553
BETTER WAY. TO TO DO THAT IN OUR

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.188
CALIFORNIA BUDGETING SYSTEM AND

00:29:50.255 --> 00:29:53.224
THAT'S THAT'S THE BASIS FOR MY

00:29:53.291 --> 00:29:55.160
FOR MY QUESTION FINANCIAL ME

00:29:55.226 --> 00:29:56.127
WILL WILL BE AS ONE MORE AND

00:29:56.194 --> 00:29:56.761
THEN WILL BE TURNED OVER TO MY

00:29:56.828 --> 00:29:57.896
COLLEAGUES TO SEVENTY SEVEN

00:29:57.962 --> 00:29:58.530
MILLION.

00:29:58.596 --> 00:30:00.465
THE REUSING FOR ONGOING PROGRAMS

00:30:00.532 --> 00:30:03.768
INSTEAD OF ONE TIME SPENDING.

00:30:03.835 --> 00:30:05.336
I ASSUME YOU'RE PROJECTING

00:30:05.403 --> 00:30:05.637
[inaudible]

00:30:05.703 --> 00:30:07.205
CONTINUED GROWTH.

00:30:07.272 --> 00:30:08.306
AS OPPOSED TO THE RECESSION

00:30:08.373 --> 00:30:10.775
SCENARIO.

00:30:10.842 --> 00:30:12.944
YES YEAH WE ARE OUR CURRENT

00:30:13.011 --> 00:30:14.412
ESTIMATES DON'T DON'T TAKE INTO

00:30:14.479 --> 00:30:15.914
TO ACCOUNT A RECESSION CENERI SO

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:17.282
WE ARE.

00:30:17.348 --> 00:30:19.050
ESTIMATING CONTINUED GROWTH SO

00:30:19.117 --> 00:30:22.654
WITH CONTINUED GROWTH IN THE THE

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:23.021
THE PROGRAMS.

00:30:23.087 --> 00:30:25.156
THAT'S GOING TOWARD WILL

00:30:25.223 --> 00:30:26.758
UNDOUBTEDLY CONTINUE ASSUMING

00:30:26.824 --> 00:30:28.092
THAT GROWTH SCENARIO IN THE NEXT

00:30:28.159 --> 00:30:33.097
BUDGET YEAR YES THAT IS THE INTO.

00:30:33.164 --> 00:30:34.933
TELL YOU ANY QUESTIONS DELIVER.

00:30:34.999 --> 00:30:36.167
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I THINK

00:30:36.234 --> 00:30:38.336
MY QUESTION IS ALONG THE SAME

00:30:38.403 --> 00:30:39.671
LINES AS YOURS I AM WORRIED

00:30:39.737 --> 00:30:40.338
ABOUT.

00:30:40.405 --> 00:30:42.640
HOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND SCHOOLS

00:30:42.707 --> 00:30:43.875
PLAN --

00:30:43.942 --> 00:30:47.779
GIVEN THE FLUCTUATING.

00:30:47.845 --> 00:30:48.680
THE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY GET

00:30:48.746 --> 00:30:49.614
FROM PROP NINETY EIGHT MY

00:30:49.681 --> 00:30:53.051
QUESTION IS.

00:30:53.117 --> 00:30:54.586
DO WE THINK THE AVERAGE OUR

00:30:54.652 --> 00:30:57.255
DAILY GUARANTEE IS THE BEST WAY

00:30:57.322 --> 00:30:58.923
TO FIND.

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:00.992
SCHOOLS BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW

00:31:01.059 --> 00:31:02.493
THAT IT'S THIRTY FAULT OF THE

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.162
SCHOOL IF THERE ARE NOT THAT

00:31:04.229 --> 00:31:06.497
STUDENT ENROLLMENT IS DOWN BUT

00:31:06.564 --> 00:31:08.333
YOU HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF

00:31:08.399 --> 00:31:09.834
TEACHERS YOU HAVE THE SAME.

00:31:09.901 --> 00:31:11.970
FACILITIES THAT YOU HAVE TO

00:31:12.036 --> 00:31:12.837
SUPPORT.

00:31:12.904 --> 00:31:14.339
IS THAT THE BEST WAY TO FIND OUR

00:31:14.405 --> 00:31:17.108
SCHOOLS.

00:31:17.175 --> 00:31:18.810
I WOULD SAY THAT --

00:31:18.876 --> 00:31:19.944
I DON'T I DON'T THINK THE

00:31:20.011 --> 00:31:21.079
ADMINISTRATION HAS A POSITION ON

00:31:21.145 --> 00:31:22.647
IT AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE IS

00:31:22.714 --> 00:31:24.782
IS THE BEST WAY OR NOT BUT THAT

00:31:24.849 --> 00:31:27.785
WAS WHAT WAS INCLUDE NINETY

00:31:27.852 --> 00:31:28.987
EIGHT AND YOU KNOW IN THE IN THE

00:31:29.053 --> 00:31:30.321
MEASURE THAT --

00:31:30.388 --> 00:31:32.457
THE VOTERS APPROVED --

00:31:32.523 --> 00:31:34.292
I THINK WE CAN PROBABLY GET INTO

00:31:34.359 --> 00:31:35.560
ALL OF MUCH LESS CONVERSATION

00:31:35.627 --> 00:31:37.362
ABOUT MAYBE IF IT'S APPROPRIATE

00:31:37.428 --> 00:31:39.297
OR OR NOT --

00:31:39.364 --> 00:31:40.598
BUT LIKE I SAID I DON'T THINK

00:31:40.665 --> 00:31:43.334
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS A HAS A A

00:31:43.401 --> 00:31:43.901
POSITION CERTAINLY THERE ARE

00:31:43.968 --> 00:31:44.769
OTHER THINGS.

00:31:44.836 --> 00:31:46.237
YOU KNOW THAT COULD BE

00:31:46.304 --> 00:31:48.773
CONSIDERED BUT FAIR ENOUGH LA A

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.541
WHAT DO YOU THINK.

00:31:50.608 --> 00:31:51.743
AB USING AVERAGE DAILY

00:31:51.809 --> 00:31:52.277
ATTENDANCE IS A LITTLE IS

00:31:52.343 --> 00:31:53.745
SIMILAR TO THE WAY YOU BUDGET

00:31:53.811 --> 00:31:54.779
OTHER PROGRAMS MOST OTHER

00:31:54.846 --> 00:31:56.080
PROGRAMS IN THE BUDGET HAVE SOME

00:31:56.147 --> 00:31:58.049
KIND OF CASE LOAD ADJUSTMENT

00:31:58.116 --> 00:31:59.550
WHETHER THAT SLOT SORTER NUMBER

00:31:59.617 --> 00:32:01.286
OF PATIENTS SERVED AND HEALTH

00:32:01.352 --> 00:32:02.453
CARE CONTEXT.

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:03.755
SCHOOL ATTENDANCE A SORT OF THE

00:32:03.821 --> 00:32:05.189
CASELOAD MEASURE WE'VE PICKED

00:32:05.256 --> 00:32:07.825
FOR OUR PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

00:32:07.892 --> 00:32:10.361
GUARANTEE IN SCHOOL FUNDING --

00:32:10.428 --> 00:32:11.195
HAVING SOME KIND OF A YOU KNOW A

00:32:11.262 --> 00:32:12.830
KID A CASELOAD MEASURE I THINK

00:32:12.897 --> 00:32:14.666
MAKES SENSE --

00:32:14.732 --> 00:32:15.900
I THINK WHAT'S KIND OF DIFFERENT

00:32:15.967 --> 00:32:17.168
FOR SCHOOLS NOW IS IN THE PAST

00:32:17.235 --> 00:32:18.236
THAT ADJUSTMENT IS ALWAYS BEEN

00:32:18.303 --> 00:32:20.538
VERY POSITIVE SCHOOL ATTENDANCE

00:32:20.605 --> 00:32:21.472
IS GOING 223%.

00:32:21.539 --> 00:32:23.841
IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS THAN

00:32:23.908 --> 00:32:25.376
IT WAS FLAT.

00:32:25.443 --> 00:32:26.511
IN TWENTY FOURTEEN FIFTEEN IT

00:32:26.577 --> 00:32:27.211
STARTED DECLINING.

00:32:27.278 --> 00:32:28.713
AND THAT'S REALLY A NEW ERA FOR

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.048
SCHOOL THE NUMBER WE HAVEN'T HAD

00:32:30.114 --> 00:32:31.316
A SUSTAINED DECLINE IN STUDENT

00:32:31.382 --> 00:32:33.251
ATTENDANCE FOR A COUPLE DECADES

00:32:33.318 --> 00:32:35.119
NOW BUT THAT IS KIND OF THE

00:32:35.186 --> 00:32:36.521
REALITY SCHOOLS ARE LOOKING AT

00:32:36.587 --> 00:32:38.756
BOTH FOR THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS

00:32:38.823 --> 00:32:40.491
AND EVEN BEYOND THAT.

00:32:40.558 --> 00:32:41.526
OKAY I I WOULD CHALLENGE ALL OF

00:32:41.592 --> 00:32:44.696
US TO MAYBE THINK OF THINGS A

00:32:44.762 --> 00:32:46.964
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY THANK YOU.

00:32:47.031 --> 00:32:49.500
A QUESTIONS COLLEAGUES

00:32:49.567 --> 00:32:52.370
[inaudible] ZERO IS PICKING

00:32:52.437 --> 00:32:53.471
BEGAN OFFER CENTER LABELS

00:32:53.538 --> 00:32:56.207
QUESTION ---HOW MANY YEARS IN THE FUTURE DO

00:32:56.274 --> 00:32:58.876
YOU THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE?

00:32:58.943 --> 00:32:59.344
SOME THE DECLINING --

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:00.645
IN ROMANS --

00:33:00.712 --> 00:33:02.246
GIVEN.

00:33:02.313 --> 00:33:03.981
WHAT OUR DEMOGRAPHICS FOLKS ARE

00:33:04.048 --> 00:33:05.583
SAYING I THINK IT'S VERY SIMILAR

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:06.484
TO WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE

00:33:06.551 --> 00:33:09.253
ANALYST'S OFFICE IS IS OBSERVING

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:09.821
AS WELL?

00:33:09.887 --> 00:33:12.056
AS USE ME LIKE CAN MENTIONED --

00:33:12.123 --> 00:33:13.591
STARTING IN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN

00:33:13.658 --> 00:33:14.559
WE'VE BEEN SEEING THIS DECLINE

00:33:14.625 --> 00:33:16.527
NOW KIND OF COMING OUT AS WE

00:33:16.594 --> 00:33:17.795
CONTINUE RECOVER FROM THE GREAT

00:33:17.862 --> 00:33:21.199
RECESSION AND WHAT WE ARE --

00:33:21.265 --> 00:33:22.467
SEEING THAT THAT IS LARGELY A

00:33:22.533 --> 00:33:24.369
FUNCTION OF IS --

00:33:24.435 --> 00:33:27.038
THE BIRTH RATES ARE DECLINING

00:33:27.105 --> 00:33:29.674
SOLD MORE AND MORE --

00:33:29.741 --> 00:33:31.876
AND LIFE AND THEREFORE THERE'S

00:33:31.943 --> 00:33:33.878
JUST FEWER CHILDREN TO

00:33:33.945 --> 00:33:34.545
MATRICULATED UP THROUGH THE CELL

00:33:34.612 --> 00:33:36.514
THIS COULD GO ON FOR DECADES AND

00:33:36.581 --> 00:33:38.316
YOU'RE SAYING.

00:33:38.383 --> 00:33:39.817
RIGHT I ATTENTION WE SOLD

00:33:39.884 --> 00:33:41.085
BECAUSE IT'S BASED PRIMARILY ON

00:33:41.152 --> 00:33:42.053
BIRTH RATES WE WERE PRETTY

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:43.788
CONFIDENT AT LEAST FOR THE NEXT

00:33:43.855 --> 00:33:44.922
FIVE YEARS BECAUSE EVEN IF PRESS

00:33:44.989 --> 00:33:45.857
INCREASED.

00:33:45.923 --> 00:33:47.458
TODAY YOU'VE GOT FIVE MORE YEARS

00:33:47.525 --> 00:33:49.227
BEFORE THOSE THAT LARGER COHORT

00:33:49.293 --> 00:33:50.862
ENTERS THE SCHOOL SYSTEM.

00:33:50.928 --> 00:33:52.230
I PROJECTIONS I THINK GO OUT.

00:33:52.296 --> 00:33:53.965
SOMEWHERE IN THE RANGE OF

00:33:54.031 --> 00:33:54.766
FIFTEEN TWENTY TO TWENTY YEARS

00:33:54.832 --> 00:33:56.167
AND WE DO HAVE DECLINES.

00:33:56.234 --> 00:33:57.735
MODEST DECLINES OVER THAT ENTIRE

00:33:57.802 --> 00:34:01.372
PERIOD OKAY LET ME COUPLE OF THE

00:34:01.439 --> 00:34:01.672
QUESTIONS.

00:34:01.739 --> 00:34:05.576
TO OF FOR EITHER ONE A VIEW --

00:34:05.643 --> 00:34:06.611
I WATER WHAT'S THE A SPENDING

00:34:06.677 --> 00:34:08.846
PER PUPIL AND CLASS SIZES AND

00:34:08.913 --> 00:34:09.714
THEN I HAVE A COUPLE OF THE

00:34:09.781 --> 00:34:10.782
QUESTIONS AFTER THAT BUT

00:34:10.848 --> 00:34:12.917
SPENDING FOR PEOPLE OF PEOPLE ON

00:34:12.984 --> 00:34:16.154
THE AVERAGE CLASS SIZE.

00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:17.588
AND HOW DOES IT COMPARE. TO

00:34:17.655 --> 00:34:19.791
OTHER STATES AND OTHER WERE SORT

00:34:19.857 --> 00:34:21.426
OF CALIFORNIA RANK AMONG.

00:34:21.492 --> 00:34:22.760
SURE SO I CAN I CAN TAKE THAT

00:34:22.827 --> 00:34:24.328
QUESTION SO PER PUPIL FUNDING

00:34:24.395 --> 00:34:25.530
UNDER PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

00:34:25.596 --> 00:34:27.432
INTO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS

00:34:27.498 --> 00:34:28.232
TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER

00:34:28.299 --> 00:34:29.567
PUPIL IN NINETEEN TWENTY THAT'S

00:34:29.634 --> 00:34:31.369
AS HIGH AS IT'S EVER BEEN

00:34:31.436 --> 00:34:33.204
ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION.

00:34:33.271 --> 00:34:35.006
AS FAR AS CLASS SIZE --

00:34:35.072 --> 00:34:37.442
CALIFORNIA'S RIGHT NOW THE RATIO

00:34:37.508 --> 00:34:41.913
OF TEACHERS TO STUDENTS ABOUT --

00:34:41.979 --> 00:34:42.747
TWENTY ONE THAT'S NOT KIND OF

00:34:42.814 --> 00:34:43.948
AVERAGE CLASS SIZE THAT'S JUST

00:34:44.015 --> 00:34:45.783
TOTAL NUMBER OF FULL TIME STAFF

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:47.852
DIVIDED BY NUMBER OF STUDENTS --

00:34:47.919 --> 00:34:49.520
WHICH IS KIND OF IN LINE WITH

00:34:49.587 --> 00:34:51.389
THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE IT WAS

00:34:51.456 --> 00:34:52.824
ABOUT --

00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:53.424
TWENTY ONE PRIOR TO THE GREAT

00:34:53.491 --> 00:34:54.859
RECESSION GREW QUITE A BIT

00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:56.060
DURING THE GREAT RECESSION AND

00:34:56.127 --> 00:34:57.228
THE PAST COUPLE YEARS IT'S BEEN

00:34:57.295 --> 00:34:59.163
DROPPING BACK MORE TO THAT

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:00.131
HISTORICAL.

00:35:00.198 --> 00:35:01.732
LEVEL I COMPARED TO SOME OTHER

00:35:01.799 --> 00:35:04.101
STATES THAT'S WERE HIGH WE

00:35:04.168 --> 00:35:05.870
TYPICALLY RANK A PRETTY LOW IN

00:35:05.937 --> 00:35:09.440
TERMS OF THE RATIO OF A STUDENTS

00:35:09.507 --> 00:35:09.740
TO TEACHERS.

00:35:09.807 --> 00:35:13.044
I MEAN THAT'S KIND OF FOR MANY

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:14.745
YEARS THAT WE'VE TENDED TO HAVE.

00:35:14.812 --> 00:35:18.015
ABOVE AVERAGE CLASS SIZE.

00:35:18.082 --> 00:35:19.050
OKAY IN IN --

00:35:19.116 --> 00:35:20.685
COUPLE OTHER COMBINED QUESTIONS

A TWENTY TWO SALARIES IT'S

00:35:27.825 --> 00:35:29.293
ACTUALLY JUST THE REVERSE WE'VE

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.529
TEND TO RANK AMONG THE TOP FIVE

00:35:31.596 --> 00:35:33.164

COMPENSATION SO --

00:35:39.036 --> 00:35:41.839
BASE SALARY WAS JUST OVER EIGHTY

00:35:41.906 --> 00:35:43.241
THOUSAND FOR THE AVERAGE TEACHER

00:36:41.499 --> 00:36:43.301
VERSUS --

00:36:43.367 --> 00:36:44.769
TEACHER CLASSROOM --

00:36:44.835 --> 00:36:46.704
EXPENSE IN TERMS OF SALARIES AND

00:36:46.771 --> 00:36:49.674
NUMBERS [inaudible]

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:52.944
JENNIFER QUESTION.

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:55.580
I I I THINK SO REAL CLEAR

00:36:55.646 --> 00:36:56.881
QUESTION LET ME SEE ME AS GET

00:36:56.948 --> 00:36:57.815
THAT WELL LET ME START WITH THE

00:36:57.882 --> 00:36:59.150
BACKGROUND AND THEN I CAN

00:36:59.216 --> 00:37:00.484
ELABORATE.

00:37:00.551 --> 00:37:01.919
WE'VE YES WE DO COLLECTED SCHOOL

00:37:01.986 --> 00:37:02.787
ACCOUNTING DATA FROM ALL

00:37:02.853 --> 00:37:04.488
DISTRICTS AND OFFICES LIKE OURS

00:37:04.555 --> 00:37:06.791
AND I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION

00:37:06.857 --> 00:37:08.559
ANALYZE THAT.

00:37:08.626 --> 00:37:09.527
CALIFORNIA SCHOOL SPEND A FAIRLY

00:37:09.594 --> 00:37:10.294
SMALL SHARE OF THE BUDGET

00:37:10.361 --> 00:37:11.362
ACTUALLY ON KIND OF

00:37:11.429 --> 00:37:12.897
ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD THAT'S

00:37:12.964 --> 00:37:14.498
ONLY TEN OR 11%.

00:37:14.565 --> 00:37:17.735
IF YOU COUNT ALL EXPENDITURES ON

00:37:17.802 --> 00:37:18.869
SAY THEY'RE AUDITOR'S ON THE

00:37:18.936 --> 00:37:20.538
SCHOOL BOARD AND SUPERINTENDENT

00:37:20.605 --> 00:37:21.339
AND ALL THIS SORT OF CENTRAL

00:37:21.405 --> 00:37:23.608
OFFICE STAFF --

00:37:23.674 --> 00:37:25.610
IT'S NOT VERY HIGH.

00:37:25.676 --> 00:37:27.345
IF DISTRICTS SPEND REALLY ABOUT

00:37:27.411 --> 00:37:28.479
TWO THIRDS OF THEIR BUDGET ON

00:37:28.546 --> 00:37:31.248
INSTRUCTION THE NEXT LARGEST

00:37:31.315 --> 00:37:32.316
COMPONENT IS FACILITY IS --

00:37:32.383 --> 00:37:34.318
SO ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES JUST

00:37:34.385 --> 00:37:35.786
AS A KIND OF A SHARE OF ALL

00:37:35.853 --> 00:37:38.623
SPENDING AREN'T A BIG CHUNK OF

00:37:38.689 --> 00:37:41.125
MOST DISTRICTS BUDGETS.

00:37:41.192 --> 00:37:43.294
SO THEN IT IS A QUESTION OF HOW

00:37:43.361 --> 00:37:45.129
TO FIND OUT HOW TO FIND A WAY TO

00:37:45.196 --> 00:37:46.230
GET MORE MONEY INTO THE

00:37:46.297 --> 00:37:48.232
CLASSROOM IF IN FACT TWO THIRDS

00:37:48.299 --> 00:37:49.934
OF THE DISTRICT BUDGETS ARE

00:37:50.001 --> 00:37:52.036
GOING TO DIRECT INSTRUCTIONAL --

00:37:52.103 --> 00:37:56.941
EFFORTS.

00:37:57.008 --> 00:37:58.209
RIGHT.

00:37:58.275 --> 00:37:59.910
IN THE STATE.

00:37:59.977 --> 00:38:02.747
I'M NOT SURE I HAVE ANY SORT OF

00:38:02.813 --> 00:38:03.414
I MEAN IF THERE'S AYE A GREAT IF

00:38:03.481 --> 00:38:04.982
THE I DON'T KNOW OF ANY STUDIES

00:38:05.049 --> 00:38:06.083
THAT HAVE TRIED TO STAY WELL

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:07.318
COULD WE TAKE HOW MUCH WORSE

00:38:07.385 --> 00:38:08.886
SPENDING ON ADMINISTRATION NOW

00:38:08.953 --> 00:38:10.788
AND KIND OF SHIFT EVEN MORE OF

00:38:10.855 --> 00:38:12.323
THAT -- TO

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:13.891
THE CLASSROOM THE STATE'S TRIED

00:38:13.958 --> 00:38:16.293
TO DO SOME THINGS LIKE THAT IN

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:18.162
THE PAST I WITH.

00:38:18.229 --> 00:38:19.196
SAY CAPS ON STUDENT TEACHER

TOWARDS INSTRUCTION --

00:38:24.502 --> 00:38:26.837
I DON'T KNOW OF ANY EVALUATIONS

00:38:26.904 --> 00:38:28.205
OF LOOKED AT WHETHER THOSE HAVE.

00:38:28.272 --> 00:38:29.907
ARE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT

00:38:29.974 --> 00:38:30.975
RELATIVELY LOW SHERIFF THAT

00:38:31.042 --> 00:38:32.076
SOMETHING THAT DISTRICT WITH ON

00:38:32.143 --> 00:38:32.910
THEIR OWN.

00:38:32.977 --> 00:38:34.345
WELL SO YOU KNOW SOME OF US ARE

00:38:34.412 --> 00:38:37.048
JUST FRUSTRATED AS TO HOW WE HOW

00:38:37.114 --> 00:38:39.450
WE DO MORE. FOR A VERY VERY

00:38:39.517 --> 00:38:41.018
IMPORTANT AREA.

00:38:41.085 --> 00:38:42.420
OF OUR STATE OPERATION AND

INTO INTO WHEREVER THE CLASSROOM

00:38:56.634 --> 00:38:58.369
TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES.

00:38:58.436 --> 00:39:01.639
AND THE BUDGET IS LIMITED EVEN

00:39:01.706 --> 00:39:03.941
THOUGH IT'S FAIRLY STAGGERING --

00:39:04.008 --> 00:39:07.011
AND LOOKING AT OPTIONS AND WE'RE

00:39:07.078 --> 00:39:08.479
TO FIND MONEY TO PUT MORE MONEY

00:39:08.546 --> 00:39:10.214
WHERE THE MONEY IS NEEDED AND

00:39:10.281 --> 00:39:12.683
THAT IS IN THE CLASSROOM --

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:14.018
VISIT HIGH COST STATE SO

00:39:14.085 --> 00:39:16.487

THE LIST IN TERMS OF TEACHERS'

00:39:17.955 --> 00:39:19.890
SALARY AND BENEFITS BUT IT ALSO

00:39:19.957 --> 00:39:21.492
COSTS A LOT OF MONEY TO LIVE

00:39:21.559 --> 00:39:23.094
HERE AND WE CERTAINLY WANT.

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:24.528
HIGH QUALITY TEACHERS LIVING

HERE AND TEACH THAT'S THE

00:39:27.331 --> 00:39:29.300
GENESIS OF MY QUESTION AND IT

00:39:29.366 --> 00:39:30.835
PROBABLY WASN'T AS CLEAR AS IT

00:39:30.901 --> 00:39:32.203
SHOULD BE SO.

00:39:32.269 --> 00:39:34.672
STAY TUNED GIVE ME A FEW MORE

00:39:34.739 --> 00:39:35.306
WEEKS HERE AND I MAY GET BETTER

00:39:35.372 --> 00:39:36.407
AT THAT.

00:39:36.474 --> 00:39:36.974
QUICK COLLEAGUES ANY FOR THE

00:39:37.041 --> 00:39:38.576

UP WHEN YOU SEE 10211% ON

00:39:40.778 --> 00:39:43.714
OVERHEAD WHAT FALLS AND OVERHEAD.

00:39:43.781 --> 00:39:44.682
BUT WE COULD GIVE YOU A SPECIFIC

00:39:44.749 --> 00:39:46.183
LESS BUT IT'S THINGS LIKE THE

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:47.752
EXPENSES OF THE SCHOOL BOARD THE

00:39:47.818 --> 00:39:48.919
SUPERINTENDENT OR

00:39:48.986 --> 00:39:50.421
SUPERINTENDENT'S DEPUTY IS FOR

00:39:50.488 --> 00:39:52.790
THE CENTRAL OFFICE EXPENSES SO

00:39:52.857 --> 00:39:55.559
NOT THE SCHOOL SITE PRINCIPAL OR

00:39:55.626 --> 00:39:56.594
AND THIS.

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:58.295
EXPENSES AT THE SCHOOL SITE.

00:39:58.362 --> 00:40:01.632
COULD BE THINGS LIKE --

00:40:01.699 --> 00:40:02.800
LIKE SAY THE CONTRACT FOR THE

00:40:02.867 --> 00:40:04.401
AUDITOR'S OR FOR FOR LEGAL

00:40:04.468 --> 00:40:07.004
ASSISTANCE KIND OF ALL THINGS

00:40:07.071 --> 00:40:08.706
LIKE THAT AND I THAT PERCENTAGE

00:40:08.773 --> 00:40:09.907
DOES FLUCTUATE SO WE CAN FOLLOW

00:40:09.974 --> 00:40:11.442
UP WITH YOUR STAFF ON THE

00:40:11.509 --> 00:40:12.576
SPECIFIC AMOUNT.

00:40:12.643 --> 00:40:13.410
FOR THAT'S OKAY I WAS JUST

00:40:13.477 --> 00:40:14.345
CURIOUS WHAT FALLS UNDER THAT

00:40:14.411 --> 00:40:16.080
BECAUSE YOU SAID 10211% IS

00:40:16.147 --> 00:40:18.382
RATHER LOW SO DOES THAT MEAN

00:40:18.449 --> 00:40:19.650
THAT SUPERINTENDENTS.

00:40:19.717 --> 00:40:21.118
UP INTO THE CITY CALIFORNIA

00:40:21.185 --> 00:40:25.723
THEIR SALARIES ARE WITHIN RANGE.

00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:26.824
OF WHAT OTHER STATES ARE PAYING.

00:40:26.891 --> 00:40:27.725

00:40:34.098 --> 00:40:35.299
FUNCTION.

00:40:35.366 --> 00:40:37.601

WITH THEM TO BE HAPPY TO ANSWER

00:43:05.516 --> 00:43:06.283
ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE

YEAH RYAN ANDERSON WITH ALEJO

00:43:10.621 --> 00:43:12.523
AND JUST A COUPLE OF QUICK

00:43:12.589 --> 00:43:13.991
COMMENTS.

00:43:14.058 --> 00:43:14.825
OVERALL --

00:43:14.892 --> 00:43:16.360
OUR OFFICE CONTINUES TO BELIEVE

00:43:16.427 --> 00:43:17.394
THAT THE L. CFF HAS SEVERAL

00:43:17.461 --> 00:43:18.662
ADVANTAGES.

00:43:18.729 --> 00:43:21.165
OVER THE STATE'S PREVIOUS SCHOOL

00:43:21.231 --> 00:43:23.901
FINANCE SYSTEM SO --

00:43:23.968 --> 00:43:25.836
WHAT WE RECOMMEND --

00:43:25.903 --> 00:43:28.372
SUPPORTING THE IT MAY A

00:43:28.439 --> 00:43:30.507
PROVIDING MOST ON GOING K.

00:43:30.574 --> 00:43:32.543
TWELVE FUNDING TO THAT FORMULA.

00:43:32.609 --> 00:43:34.545
HOWEVER ON TWO ASPECTS OF THE

00:43:34.611 --> 00:43:36.847
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WE DO HAVE

00:43:36.914 --> 00:43:39.149
CONCERNS THE FIRST --

00:43:39.216 --> 00:43:42.753
CONCERNS THIS CALL A CAB THE

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:46.890
FINANCE JUST MENTIONED SO THE WE

00:43:46.957 --> 00:43:48.258
ARE WE THINK PUTTING FORWARD.

00:43:48.325 --> 00:43:49.560
OF THIS PROPOSAL IS AN

00:43:49.626 --> 00:43:51.161
ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE REALITY

00:43:51.228 --> 00:43:53.263
THAT THE CHANGE THE STATE MADE

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:55.065
LAST YEAR TO AUTOMATICALLY

00:43:55.132 --> 00:43:55.799
PROVIDE A COST OF LIVING

00:43:55.866 --> 00:43:57.835
ADJUSTMENT. TO THEY'LL CFF IS

00:43:57.901 --> 00:43:59.403
NOT GOING TO BE ACTIONABLE IN

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:01.238
ALL BUDGET SITUATIONS THIS IS

00:44:01.305 --> 00:44:02.940
THE SINGLE LARGEST PROGRAM.

00:44:03.007 --> 00:44:04.842
AND THE GENERAL FUND OVER SIXTY

00:44:04.908 --> 00:44:06.510
BILLION DOLLARS RIGHT NOW AND

00:44:06.577 --> 00:44:09.580
THERE WILL BE SOME YEARS WHERE

00:44:09.646 --> 00:44:11.415
THE STATE'S SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD.

00:44:11.482 --> 00:44:12.850
TO PROVIDE THE FULL STATUTORY

00:44:12.916 --> 00:44:14.218
COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT FOR

00:44:14.284 --> 00:44:17.688
THAT AND IN FACT SINCE NINETEEN

00:44:17.755 --> 00:44:18.322
NINETY NINETY ONE THE STATE HAS

00:44:18.389 --> 00:44:20.057
NOT PROVIDED THE FULL STATUTORY

00:44:20.124 --> 00:44:23.127
I K. TWELVE COLA IN ABOUT A

00:44:23.193 --> 00:44:24.695
THIRD OF ALL YEARS.

00:44:24.762 --> 00:44:25.329
NOW.

00:44:25.396 --> 00:44:27.131
WE THINK RATHER THAN IMPOSING

00:44:27.197 --> 00:44:28.532
THIS NEW --

00:44:28.599 --> 00:44:30.701
FORMULA WHICH WILL BE DIFFICULT

00:44:30.768 --> 00:44:31.301
TO UNDERSTAND WILL MAKE THAT

00:44:31.368 --> 00:44:32.302
BUDGET.

00:44:32.369 --> 00:44:34.371
PROCESS LESS TRANSPARENT WILL WE

00:44:34.438 --> 00:44:36.373
WOULD RECOMMEND JUST RETURNING

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:37.641
TO THE STATE'S TRADITIONAL

00:44:37.708 --> 00:44:39.276
PRACTICE OF PROVIDING

00:44:39.343 --> 00:44:40.110
AUGMENTATIONS.

00:44:40.177 --> 00:44:43.947
ON A DISCRETIONARY BASIS JUST

00:44:44.014 --> 00:44:45.115
EVERY YEAR --

00:44:45.182 --> 00:44:47.051
IT YOU WILL EVALUATE THE BUDGET

00:44:47.117 --> 00:44:48.685
CONDITION AND MAKE A DECISION

00:44:48.752 --> 00:44:49.520
ABOUT.

00:44:49.586 --> 00:44:50.954
CAN WE PROVIDE A COST OF LIVING

00:44:51.021 --> 00:44:53.157
ADJUSTMENT TO THIS PROGRAM AND

00:44:53.223 --> 00:44:54.958
IF SO WHAT SIZE OF THAT

00:44:55.025 --> 00:44:57.361
INVESTMENT.

00:44:57.428 --> 00:44:59.163
THE OTHER CONCERN WE HAVE --

00:44:59.229 --> 00:45:01.832
CONCERNS THE COUNTY OFFICE OF

00:45:01.899 --> 00:45:03.901
FORMULA AND SPECIFICALLY THE

00:45:03.967 --> 00:45:05.702
MINIMUM STATE AID PROVISIONS SO

00:45:05.769 --> 00:45:07.438
JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BRAD

00:45:07.504 --> 00:45:09.807
BACKGROUND HERE.

00:45:09.873 --> 00:45:11.341
PRIOR.

00:45:11.408 --> 00:45:12.543
TO THIRTEEN FOURTEEN OF ONE

00:45:12.609 --> 00:45:14.278
COUNTY OFFICES RECEIVED

00:45:14.344 --> 00:45:16.013
ADDITIONAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUE

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:17.514
THE STATE REDUCED ITS.

00:45:17.581 --> 00:45:18.949
OF FUNDING FOR THOSE COUNTY

00:45:19.016 --> 00:45:21.218
OFFICES DOLLAR FOR DOLLARS SO WE

00:45:21.285 --> 00:45:22.019
WE DID NOT.

00:45:22.086 --> 00:45:23.187
ART IN MOST CASES DOLLAR FOR

00:45:23.253 --> 00:45:25.122
DOLLAR SO WE DO NOT ALLOW COUNTY

00:45:25.189 --> 00:45:26.290
OFFICES TO RECEIVE

00:45:26.356 --> 00:45:27.257
DISPROPORTIONATELY GREATER

00:45:27.324 --> 00:45:29.693
FUNDING BASED SOLELY ON THEIR

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.128
PROPERTY TAX COLLECTIONS.

00:45:31.195 --> 00:45:32.296
OF WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF THE

00:45:32.362 --> 00:45:35.432
MINIMUM STATE A PROVISION IN

00:45:35.499 --> 00:45:36.033
THIRTEEN FOURTEEN WE PUT A CAP

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:37.868
ON HOW MUCH THAT STATE FUNDING

00:45:37.935 --> 00:45:40.137
COULD BE REDUCED FOR GROWTH AND

00:45:40.204 --> 00:45:42.473
PROPERTY TAX REVENUE.

00:45:42.539 --> 00:45:43.941
AS A RESULT.

00:45:44.007 --> 00:45:45.576
COUNTY OFFICES THAT ARE SAYING

00:45:45.642 --> 00:45:47.578
ESPECIALLY RAPID INCREASES IN

00:45:47.644 --> 00:45:48.879
THEIR PROPERTY TAX COLLECTIONS

00:45:48.946 --> 00:45:50.881
NOW RECEIVE DISPROPORTIONATELY

00:45:50.948 --> 00:45:52.282
GREATER.

00:45:52.349 --> 00:45:54.184
FUNDING AMOUNTS THIS LEADS TO

00:45:54.251 --> 00:45:55.819
SOME CONCERNS WE HAVE ABOUT

00:45:55.886 --> 00:45:57.988
INEQUITIES IN THE IRRATIONAL

00:45:58.055 --> 00:45:59.556
INEQUITIES IN COUNTY OFFICE.

00:45:59.623 --> 00:46:01.225
OF FUNDING BUT WE'RE ALSO

00:46:01.291 --> 00:46:02.993
CONCERNED THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:04.361
BUDGET DOES NOT ADEQUATELY.

00:46:04.428 --> 00:46:06.964
I'D ACCOUNT FOR THE FULL COST OF

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:07.798
THIS PROVISION.

00:46:07.865 --> 00:46:10.000
I'D.

00:46:10.067 --> 00:46:10.400
DOUBLE.

00:46:10.467 --> 00:46:10.834
THE ADMINISTRATION'S

00:46:10.901 --> 00:46:13.303
LONGSTANDING PRACTICE IS JUST TO

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:14.872
TAKE THE MOST RECENT.

00:46:14.938 --> 00:46:16.607
DATA FOR THE COSTA MINIMUM STATE

00:46:16.673 --> 00:46:18.609
AID AND TO HOLD THAT FLAT ACROSS

00:46:18.675 --> 00:46:19.910
THE THREE YEARS IN THE BUDGET

00:46:19.977 --> 00:46:20.777
WINDOW.

00:46:20.844 --> 00:46:22.646
WHEN IN FACT WE KNOW PROPERTY

00:46:22.713 --> 00:46:24.314
TAX VALUES ARE INCREASING UNLESS

00:46:24.381 --> 00:46:26.150
THE THE COST OF THIS PROVISION

00:46:26.216 --> 00:46:27.918
IS INCREASING YOUR OVER HERE OUR

00:46:27.985 --> 00:46:30.721
OFFICES PROJECTIONS SHOW THAT?

00:46:30.787 --> 00:46:33.123
WE WE PROJECT THAT THE FULL COST

00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:34.958
OF THIS PROVISIONAL BE ABOUT

00:46:35.025 --> 00:46:35.792
FORTY MILLION.

00:46:35.859 --> 00:46:37.327
A MORE THAN THE ADMINISTRATION

00:46:37.394 --> 00:46:39.897
CURRENTLY AUGUST ON THE LAST

00:46:39.963 --> 00:46:41.765
PANEL IS NOT MUCH OF A CUSHION

00:46:41.832 --> 00:46:43.400
WITHIN OUR PROPOSITION NINETY

00:46:43.467 --> 00:46:44.501
EIGHT PACKAGE RIGHT NOW.

00:46:44.568 --> 00:46:46.170
SO WE DO THINK THAT THIS

00:46:46.236 --> 00:46:47.738
UNACCOUNTED FOR COSTA SOMETHING.

00:46:47.804 --> 00:46:49.106
THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE

00:46:49.173 --> 00:46:49.706
CONSIDERING [inaudible]

00:46:49.773 --> 00:46:53.310
AS A WELL WITH RESPECT TO THIS

00:46:53.377 --> 00:46:55.479
WITH RESPECT TO THE SO.

00:46:55.546 --> 00:46:58.282
SERIES AND AND THE ONES THAT --

00:46:58.348 --> 00:46:59.883
ARE LOCATED IN AREAS WHERE

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:01.652
PROPERTY TAX THIS IS

00:47:01.718 --> 00:47:02.920
DRAMATICALLY INCREASING DUE TO A

00:47:02.986 --> 00:47:04.888
ROOM STAGGERING INCREASES IN

00:47:04.955 --> 00:47:06.356
PROPERTY VALUES WHERE IS THAT

00:47:06.423 --> 00:47:08.659
MONEY GO DOES IT STAY WITHIN THE

00:47:08.725 --> 00:47:10.661
COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION OR

00:47:10.727 --> 00:47:12.596
WHAT.

00:47:12.663 --> 00:47:15.866
AND SO IT DEPENDS --

00:47:15.933 --> 00:47:19.369
TO A CERTAIN EXTENT AND THAT THE

00:47:19.436 --> 00:47:21.605
LIMIT OF THE COUNTY OFFICE OF

00:47:21.672 --> 00:47:24.775
FUNDING IS DECIDED BOTH BY ITS

00:47:24.841 --> 00:47:26.410
PRIMARY FUNDING FORMULA

00:47:26.476 --> 00:47:28.679
ENTITLEMENT AND BY ITS MINIMUM

00:47:28.745 --> 00:47:30.147
STATE A PROVISION.

00:47:30.214 --> 00:47:31.081
SO.

00:47:31.148 --> 00:47:35.252
IF THERE'S STILL ROOM WITHIN --

00:47:35.319 --> 00:47:36.687
THAT ENTITLEMENT AMOUNT THE

00:47:36.753 --> 00:47:38.222
ADDITIONAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUE

00:47:38.288 --> 00:47:39.723
WILL STAY WITH THE COUNTY OFFICE

00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:41.959
SOME COUNTY OFFICES HOWEVER

00:47:42.025 --> 00:47:43.193
CAPPED OUT --

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:45.395
THEIR PROPERTY TAX REVENUES ARE

00:47:45.462 --> 00:47:47.064
SUFFICIENT TO FUND THEY'RE

00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:49.132
ENTITLED A THIRD TOTAL LCF

00:47:49.199 --> 00:47:50.167
ENTITLEMENT.

00:47:50.234 --> 00:47:52.269
AND THEIR STATE FUNDING EXACTLY

00:47:52.336 --> 00:47:54.171
EQUALS THEIR MINIMUM STATE AID

00:47:54.238 --> 00:47:55.906
FORMULA AND THOSE CASES THE

00:47:55.973 --> 00:47:57.908
ADDITIONAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUES

00:47:57.975 --> 00:47:59.910
ACTUALLY RIVER TO THE COUNTY

00:47:59.977 --> 00:48:02.079
COURTS [inaudible]

00:48:02.145 --> 00:48:04.815
SO.

00:48:04.881 --> 00:48:07.050
ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT THE FOR

00:48:07.117 --> 00:48:08.885
THOSE CUNTIES WHERE THE

00:48:08.952 --> 00:48:10.787
PROPERTY TAX IS.

00:48:10.854 --> 00:48:12.689
HIS HIGH IS HIGH [inaudible]

00:48:12.756 --> 00:48:14.191
LISA RECEIPTS.

00:48:14.258 --> 00:48:16.860
THAT THAT MONEY BE REDISTRIBUTED

00:48:16.927 --> 00:48:19.263
TO OTHER COUNTIES THAT ARE NOT.

00:48:19.329 --> 00:48:20.731
TO EXPERIENCING THE SAME RAPID

00:48:20.797 --> 00:48:22.633
GROWTH IN.

00:48:22.699 --> 00:48:24.334
PROPERTY TO AND PROPERTY VALUES

00:48:24.401 --> 00:48:27.170
IN PROPERTY TAX REVENUE.

00:48:27.237 --> 00:48:31.141
ED SO LET MECHANISM WOULD HAVE.

00:48:31.208 --> 00:48:32.209
TO BE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM

00:48:32.276 --> 00:48:35.279
THAT BECAUSE PROPOSITION --

00:48:35.345 --> 00:48:36.046
THIRTEEN LIMITS THE STATE'S

00:48:36.113 --> 00:48:38.081
ABILITY.

00:48:38.148 --> 00:48:39.583
TO ALLOCATE PROPERTY TAX

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:41.118
COLLECTIONS ACROSS STATE LINES

00:48:41.184 --> 00:48:42.619
BUT THERE ISSUE ACTUALLY HERE IS

00:48:42.686 --> 00:48:44.788
ON THE PROPERTY TAX VALUES THAT

00:48:44.855 --> 00:48:46.823
THE STATE FUNDING SO THE MINIMUM

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:48.358
STATE AID PROVISIONS SAYS.

00:48:48.425 --> 00:48:51.828
THAT IN THESE COUNTY IS WHERE.

00:48:51.895 --> 00:48:53.330
PROPERTY TAX COLLECTIONS MIGHT

00:48:53.397 --> 00:48:56.800
BE ENOUGH THAT WE COULD FIND THE

00:48:56.867 --> 00:48:59.703
COUNTIES ENTITLED AN ENTIRE LCF

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:01.371
ENTITLEMENT WITHOUT ANY STATE

00:49:01.438 --> 00:49:02.406
FUNDING.

00:49:02.472 --> 00:49:03.740
THE STATE WILL STILL HAVE TO

00:49:03.807 --> 00:49:05.409
PROVIDE THEM SOME FUNDING ON TOP

00:49:05.475 --> 00:49:08.712
OF THAT PROPERTY TAX COLLECTION

00:49:08.779 --> 00:49:09.913
JUST TO ENSURE.

00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:11.281
THAT THEIR TOTAL STATE FUNDING

00:49:11.348 --> 00:49:14.351
IS NO LESS THAN IT WAS IN.

00:49:14.418 --> 00:49:15.585
THIRTEEN FOURTEEN IF WE WERE TO

00:49:15.652 --> 00:49:19.890
SAY I OR PUT A CAP ON IT AND SAY

00:49:19.956 --> 00:49:20.891
FOR INSTANCE.

00:49:20.957 --> 00:49:22.926
THAT THE MINIMUM STATE AID

00:49:22.993 --> 00:49:24.461
PROVISIONAL NOW BE STATE FUNDING

00:49:24.528 --> 00:49:27.864
CAN BE NO LESS THAN IT WAS AND

00:49:27.931 --> 00:49:29.199
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN OR EIGHTEEN

00:49:29.266 --> 00:49:30.767
NINETEEN THAT THAT WOULD NOT

00:49:30.834 --> 00:49:32.302
FREE UP PROPERTY TAX REVENUE AND

00:49:32.369 --> 00:49:34.237
FREE UP STATE FUNDING THAT COULD

00:49:34.304 --> 00:49:35.205
BE ALLOCATED.

00:49:35.272 --> 00:49:36.606
TO ANY K. TWELVE PURPOSES THAT

00:49:36.673 --> 00:49:40.210
REQUIRE A MODIFICATION TO PROP.

00:49:40.277 --> 00:49:41.878
NINETY EIGHT IT DOES NOT WE THE

00:49:41.945 --> 00:49:43.380
LEGISLATURE COULD DO THAT YES.

00:49:43.447 --> 00:49:45.048
SO WE WOULD ADJUST THE AMOUNT OF

00:49:45.115 --> 00:49:47.284
STATE FUNDING THAT'S PROVIDED

00:49:47.351 --> 00:49:48.652
OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND. TO

00:49:48.719 --> 00:49:50.187
THESE COUNTY OFFICES.

01:03:00.042 --> 01:03:01.577
THAT MAINLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS

01:03:01.644 --> 01:03:02.945
HAS BEEN ASKED BY THE US

01:03:03.012 --> 01:03:04.413
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:06.115
PRESENT OUR DASHBOARD --

01:03:06.182 --> 01:03:07.984
TO OTHER STATES SO --

01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:09.118
THEY MAY NOT AGREE WITH

01:03:09.185 --> 01:03:10.419
EVERYTHING WE'RE DOING IN THE

01:03:10.486 --> 01:03:12.155
DASHBOARD BUT THEY DO LIKE NOW

01:03:12.221 --> 01:03:13.289
THE DESIGN.

01:03:13.356 --> 01:03:15.691
AND THEY DO LIKE THAT MULTIPLE

01:03:15.758 --> 01:03:17.760
MEASURES THAT WERE USING I THINK

01:03:17.827 --> 01:03:19.128
THE QUITE FRANKLY THAT

01:03:19.195 --> 01:03:20.596
CALIFORNIA'S ON THE LEADING EDGE.

01:03:20.663 --> 01:03:23.266
OF OF AN ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM

01:03:23.332 --> 01:03:24.534
IN THE DASHBOARD --

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:25.668
FOR PARENTS AND COMMUNITY

01:03:25.735 --> 01:03:27.170
MEMBERS BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST

01:03:27.236 --> 01:03:29.572
STATE INDICATORS WERE THE STATE --

01:03:29.639 --> 01:03:32.275
DEVELOP THESE CALCULATIONS AND

01:03:32.341 --> 01:03:34.010
AND REPEATS THEM BACK OUT --

01:03:34.076 --> 01:03:35.511
BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES SOME LOCAL

01:03:35.578 --> 01:03:37.914
INDICATORS THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:40.750
ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTE --

01:03:40.816 --> 01:03:42.351
TO THAT DASHBOARD LOCAL

01:03:42.418 --> 01:03:44.153
INFORMATION THAT THE STATE

01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:46.289
DOESN'T HALF SO THE COMBINATION

01:03:46.355 --> 01:03:48.157
OF STATE INFORMATION AS WELL AS

01:03:48.224 --> 01:03:49.625
LOCAL INFORMATION WHICH IS

01:03:49.692 --> 01:03:51.794
PRETTY UNIQUE ACROSS ALL STATES

01:03:51.861 --> 01:03:52.094
[inaudible]

01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:56.265
AND TOMORROW.

01:03:56.332 --> 01:03:59.735
THANK YOU ON ON THE DASHBOARD --

01:03:59.802 --> 01:04:02.171
IT'S NICE I I LIKE IT BUT ON THE

01:04:02.238 --> 01:04:04.307
BREAK DOWN THOSE NUMBERS EVEN

01:04:04.373 --> 01:04:06.275
CLOSER THAN DASHBOARD --

01:04:06.342 --> 01:04:07.109
DO YOU HAVE A PLACE FOR THE

01:04:07.176 --> 01:04:08.511
PARENTS CAN GOAL TO SAY THEY'RE

01:04:08.578 --> 01:04:10.246
GOING TO BE MOVING INTO A NEW

01:04:10.313 --> 01:04:12.715
NEIGHBORHOOD NURSERY --

01:04:12.782 --> 01:04:14.483
SCHOOLS IN THAT CITY AND THERE.

01:04:14.550 --> 01:04:17.954
TRYING TO MOVE TO THE LOCATION

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:19.689
THAT IS THE BEST SCHOOL WE

01:04:19.755 --> 01:04:20.356
ACTUALLY --

01:04:20.423 --> 01:04:23.292
COMPARE STATISTICS SIDE BY SIDE

01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:24.460
SO IT GETS DOWN TO THE ACTUAL.

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:26.462
NUMBERS.

01:04:26.529 --> 01:04:27.897
SO WHAT WITH THERE ARE THERE ARE

01:04:27.964 --> 01:04:29.799
A COUPLE OF THINGS WE DO NOT I

01:04:29.865 --> 01:04:30.933
WOULDN'T SAY WE DO ANYTHING

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.935
SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT PURPOSE.

01:04:33.002 --> 01:04:34.503
BUT WE DO WE DO HAVE SOME

01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:36.172
FUNCTIONALITY THATASSIST WITH

01:04:36.239 --> 01:04:38.608
THAT FOR INSTANCE YOU CAN LOOK

01:04:38.674 --> 01:04:40.076
AT ALL THE SCHOOLS WITHIN A

01:04:40.142 --> 01:04:41.577
DISTRICT SO.

01:04:41.644 --> 01:04:43.679
SO IF THE IF A PARENT IS

01:04:43.746 --> 01:04:45.781
CERTAINLY LOOKING TO MOVE THEIR

01:04:45.848 --> 01:04:47.316
CHILD.

01:04:47.383 --> 01:04:48.951
AT THE SCHOOLS WITH IN THEIR

01:04:49.018 --> 01:04:51.587
GEOGRAPHIC AREA THEN THAT CAN BE

01:04:51.654 --> 01:04:53.356
DONE THROUGH THE DASHBOARD WE DO

01:04:53.422 --> 01:04:56.292
HAVE A FUNCTIONALITY THAT ALLOWS.

01:04:56.359 --> 01:04:59.028
FOR A ANYONE TO COMPARE THERE'S

01:04:59.095 --> 01:05:02.565
HOW THE STATE IS DOING OVERALL-SO YOU CAN YOU CAN MAKE THAT

01:05:02.632 --> 01:05:04.200
COMPARISON TO SEE IF.

01:05:04.267 --> 01:05:06.702
AT MIT AM I ABOVE I AM ABOUT THE

01:05:06.769 --> 01:05:09.005
STATE AVERAGE OR MY BELOW THE

01:05:09.071 --> 01:05:10.239
STATE AVERAGE WHAT WHAT WHAT

01:05:10.306 --> 01:05:11.607
WHAT I MEAN WILL GIVE THE ACTUAL

01:05:11.674 --> 01:05:13.643
PERCENTAGES PER SCHOOL OF

01:05:13.709 --> 01:05:15.077
BREAKING DOWN AND MATH SCIENCES.

01:05:15.144 --> 01:05:15.978
SCIENCE --

01:05:16.045 --> 01:05:18.080
INFLATION COMPARED WITH OTHER

01:05:18.147 --> 01:05:18.848
SCHOOLS.

01:05:18.914 --> 01:05:21.317
THE ACTUAL NUMBERS.

01:05:21.384 --> 01:05:23.452
RIGHT SO SO I AM NOT SURE I

01:05:23.519 --> 01:05:25.821
QUITE UNDERSTAND THE THE THE

01:05:25.888 --> 01:05:26.989
QUESTION BUT THERE ARE LOW.

01:05:27.056 --> 01:05:28.591
THERE ARE A LOT OF THERE IS A

01:05:28.658 --> 01:05:29.892
LOT OF ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO

01:05:29.959 --> 01:05:31.560
COMPARE --

01:05:31.627 --> 01:05:32.895
WITHIN A DEBT THE SCHOOLS WITHIN

01:05:32.962 --> 01:05:35.331
A DISTRICT WHICH IS WHERE MOST

01:05:35.398 --> 01:05:37.333
PARENTS ARE LOOKING AT THE OTHER

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:38.701
THING THAT THAT I THINK IT DOES

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:40.603
IS -- IT HAS

01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:42.138
THAT THAT DASHBOARD WITH A

01:05:42.204 --> 01:05:44.273
NUMBER OF GAUGES FOR ALL OF

01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:45.875
THOSE MULTIPLE --

01:05:45.941 --> 01:05:46.842
MEASURES THE DIFFERENT

01:05:46.909 --> 01:05:48.477
INDICATORS THAT WE HAVE IN A

01:05:48.544 --> 01:05:49.879
SINGLE PLACE.

01:05:49.945 --> 01:05:51.747
BECAUSE WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE

01:05:51.814 --> 01:05:54.684
IS THAT PARENTS WANT TO CHOOSE A

01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:57.053
SCHOOL FOR A PARTICULAR REASON

01:05:57.119 --> 01:05:58.387
OFTEN --

01:05:58.454 --> 01:05:59.889
THEY MAY BE INTERESTED IN

01:05:59.955 --> 01:06:01.190
ACADEMICS AND THEY WANT TO LOOK

01:06:01.257 --> 01:06:02.224
AT THE ASSESSMENT.

01:06:02.291 --> 01:06:04.327
RESULTS BUT MAYBE WHAT THEY'RE

01:06:04.393 --> 01:06:05.828
MOST INTERESTED IN IS IS THE IS

01:06:05.895 --> 01:06:07.330
THE SCHOOL HAVE A GOOD --

01:06:07.396 --> 01:06:09.332
COMMUNITY RIGHT IS THERE IS

01:06:09.398 --> 01:06:10.599
THERE IS THERE --

01:06:10.666 --> 01:06:12.535
HOW HOW IS THE SAFETY RIGHT SO

01:06:12.601 --> 01:06:13.703
WITH SO ONE OF THE SUSPENSION

01:06:13.769 --> 01:06:15.938
RATES LOOK LIKE IN THAT SCHOOL

01:06:16.005 --> 01:06:18.174
OR PERHAPS THERE --

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:18.808
PARENT OF AN ENGLISH LEARNERS SO

01:06:18.874 --> 01:06:21.510
THEY WANT.

01:06:21.577 --> 01:06:23.813
A CATEGORY SO IT BY DOING THAT

01:06:23.879 --> 01:06:25.548
MULTIPLE MEASURES IT DOES ALLOW

01:06:25.614 --> 01:06:28.184
PARENTS TO FOCUS ON A SINGLE

01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:30.419
MEASURE AS WELL AS LOOKING AT

01:06:30.486 --> 01:06:38.928
OVERALL HOW A SCHOOL IS DOING --

01:06:38.994 --> 01:06:40.763
SO I WISH I COULD CONTINUE.

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:42.631
SO -- WE DID --

01:06:42.698 --> 01:06:45.034
SERVE AN INTERACTIVE PROCESS.

01:06:45.101 --> 01:06:46.569
I APPRECIATE THAT SO --

01:06:46.635 --> 01:06:48.137
WE DID IDENTIFY --

01:06:48.204 --> 01:06:49.338
DISTRICTS --

01:06:49.405 --> 01:06:51.307
SERRA WAS SAYING --

01:06:51.374 --> 01:06:52.842
FOR DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE I

01:06:52.908 --> 01:06:54.877
WON'T GO INTO THE ACTUAL NUMBERS

01:06:54.944 --> 01:06:56.245
IN THE DETAILS THEY ARE IN IN

01:06:56.312 --> 01:06:57.780
YOUR INFORMATION BUT I CAN

01:06:57.847 --> 01:06:58.881
CERTAINLY ADDRESS THOSE IF.

01:06:58.948 --> 01:07:01.884
IF IF YOU HAVE --

01:07:01.951 --> 01:07:02.818
QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT.

01:07:02.885 --> 01:07:04.987
USING THE LOCAL CONTROL --

01:07:05.054 --> 01:07:06.956
FOR A UNDING FORMULA AND THE

01:07:07.022 --> 01:07:09.058
THE PHILOSOPHY BEHIND THAT WE DO

01:07:09.125 --> 01:07:10.826
BELIEVE THAT --

01:07:10.893 --> 01:07:12.728
I THINK HISTORY.

01:07:12.795 --> 01:07:14.163
EXPERIENCE --

01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:16.399
AND SOME SOME STUDIES HAVE SHOWN

01:07:16.465 --> 01:07:18.601
US THAT --

01:07:18.667 --> 01:07:20.903
HAVING DECISIONS MADE AT THE

01:07:20.970 --> 01:07:22.972
LOCAL LEVEL AS LOCAL AS POSSIBLE

01:07:23.038 --> 01:07:24.740
I HAS A BETTER CHANCE OF BEING

01:07:24.807 --> 01:07:27.243
SUCCESSFUL AND SUSTAINABLE WHICH

01:07:27.309 --> 01:07:29.211
IS IMPORTANT --

01:07:29.278 --> 01:07:30.212
FOR MAKING CHANGES AND

01:07:30.279 --> 01:07:31.614
IMPROVEMENTS --

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:34.016
IN IN SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY

01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:35.851
HAVING THAT THE OLD SYSTEM UNDER

01:07:35.918 --> 01:07:38.120
NCLB WAS VERY TOP DOWN IT WAS

01:07:38.187 --> 01:07:40.189
VERY -- DC

01:07:40.256 --> 01:07:43.192
SACRAMENTO I DIRECTED FOR WHAT

01:07:43.259 --> 01:07:44.794
SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS HAD TO DO

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:46.495
I WAS VERY SPECIFIC STEPS ONCE

01:07:46.562 --> 01:07:48.230
THEY WERE IDENTIFIED.

01:07:48.297 --> 01:07:49.165
THIS MUCH MORE PUTS THE

01:07:49.231 --> 01:07:51.066
OWNERSHIP DOWN INTO THE

01:07:51.133 --> 01:07:53.335
COMMUNITY INTO COUNTY OFFICES

01:07:53.402 --> 01:07:55.104
WHERE THE SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS

01:07:55.171 --> 01:07:56.906
ARE LOCATED SO THAT THEY CAN IN

01:07:56.972 --> 01:07:59.041
FACT ASSIST THEM BECAUSE WHAT WE

01:07:59.108 --> 01:07:59.775
HAVE FOUND.

01:07:59.842 --> 01:08:01.310
IS THAT IF A IF A SCHOOL FOR

01:08:01.377 --> 01:08:02.711
INSTANCE IS NOT DOING WELL IN

01:08:02.778 --> 01:08:04.380
ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS THERE MAY

01:08:04.447 --> 01:08:06.215
BE MULTIPLE REASONS FOR THAT

01:08:06.282 --> 01:08:08.083
THERE'S NOT A SINGLE REASON.

01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:09.752
IT COULD BE THE INSTRUCTION BUT

01:08:09.819 --> 01:08:12.087
IT COULD BE MATERIALS IT COULD

01:08:12.154 --> 01:08:12.521
BE --

01:08:12.588 --> 01:08:14.356
STUDENT ATTENDANCE IT COULD BE

01:08:14.423 --> 01:08:15.624
THIS AT THE SAFETY IN THE SCHOOL

01:08:15.691 --> 01:08:16.859
THERE COULD BE A LOT OF REASONS

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:18.861
SO YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT LOCAL

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:21.330
COMMUNITY IN ORDER TO MAKE THE

01:08:21.397 --> 01:08:23.833
BEST DECISIONS AND THE DATA --

01:08:23.899 --> 01:08:25.067
THAT GOES WITH THAT LOCAL.

01:08:25.134 --> 01:08:27.536
COMMUNITY SO MOVING AWAY AS WE

01:08:27.603 --> 01:08:28.304
HAVE FROM AND SEE --

01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:29.405
BE -- TO THE

01:08:29.472 --> 01:08:30.239
NEW --

01:08:30.306 --> 01:08:32.041
FEDERAL REAUTHORIZATION **** OUT

01:08:32.107 --> 01:08:34.076
EVERY STUDENT SUCCEEDS ACT IT

01:08:34.143 --> 01:08:36.312
DOES ALLOW FOR A MORE

01:08:36.378 --> 01:08:37.246
FLEXIBILITY IN OUR

01:08:37.313 --> 01:08:38.747
ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM WHICH

01:08:38.814 --> 01:08:41.717
WE'VE DONE TO A GREAT DEAL OF

01:08:41.784 --> 01:08:43.118
EXTENT TO THE X. GREATEST EXTENT.

01:08:43.185 --> 01:08:44.386
POSSIBLE --

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:45.688
THERE ARE STILL SOME DISCONNECTS

01:08:45.754 --> 01:08:47.056
BETWEEN --

01:08:47.122 --> 01:08:49.492
WHAT CALIFORNIA?

01:08:49.558 --> 01:08:52.695
WOULD LIKE TO BUT WE HAVE

01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:53.996
COMBINED THOSE IN A SINGLE

01:08:54.063 --> 01:08:55.865
ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM.

01:08:55.931 --> 01:08:58.467
SALAS AGAIN SERRA WAS MENTIONING --

01:08:58.534 --> 01:08:59.535
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REQUIRES

01:08:59.602 --> 01:09:02.838
US TO IDENTIFY SCHOOLS --

01:09:02.905 --> 01:09:03.873
FOR FOR IMPROVEMENT AND SO WE

01:09:03.939 --> 01:09:07.576
HAVE DONE THAT AS OF JANUARY --

01:09:07.643 --> 01:09:09.645
WE STILL THINK THAT THE THE

01:09:09.712 --> 01:09:12.481
AGENCY OF CHANGE IS GOING TO BE

01:09:12.548 --> 01:09:14.650
THE DISTRICT NOT THE INDIVIDUAL

01:09:14.717 --> 01:09:16.118
SCHOOL -- I

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:17.653
THINK AGAIN RESEARCH HAS SHOWN

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:20.189
US UNDER NCLB THAT IF YOU FOCUS

01:09:20.256 --> 01:09:22.791
DOWN TO A SCHOOL LEVEL FROM THE

01:09:22.858 --> 01:09:24.860
STATE TO THE SCHOOL --

01:09:24.927 --> 01:09:26.428
YOU CAN MAKE SMALL AMOUNT OF

01:09:26.495 --> 01:09:27.530
CHANGES FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF

01:09:27.596 --> 01:09:29.465
TIME BUT IT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE

01:09:29.532 --> 01:09:31.333
REALLY HAVE TO BUILD CAPACITY IN

01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:33.202
THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. TO HELP THE

01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:34.503
SCHOOL DISTRICT.

01:09:34.570 --> 01:09:36.605
I HELP THEIR SCHOOLS AND SUSTAIN

01:09:36.672 --> 01:09:39.708
WHATEVER GAINS THEY CAN MAKE SO --

01:09:39.775 --> 01:09:42.778
THOSE WERE ALSO IDENTIFIED AS

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:44.613
AND AGAIN SERRA WAS MENTIONING --

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.215
THERE WITH THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN

01:09:46.282 --> 01:09:47.550
BUDGET PUTTING MONEY INTO THE

01:09:47.616 --> 01:09:49.018
COUNTY OFFICES OF THE COUNTY

01:09:49.084 --> 01:09:50.786
OFFICES CAN HELP BUILD THE

01:09:50.853 --> 01:09:52.388
CAPACITY IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:09:52.454 --> 01:09:53.489
SO THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN

01:09:53.556 --> 01:09:54.623
HELP THEMSELVES.

01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:56.392
AND HELP THEIR SCHOOLS --

01:09:56.458 --> 01:09:59.094
IS WHAT HAS JUST --

01:09:59.161 --> 01:10:02.264
BEGAN OTHER --

01:10:02.331 --> 01:10:05.734
CDP THE STATE BOARD CCE ARMY

SURE THAT THE EFFORTS ACROSS THE

01:10:15.544 --> 01:10:17.813
STATE ARE CALIBRATED --

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.949
AND TO OUR AND FOLKS ARE TALKING

01:10:20.015 --> 01:10:21.417
TO EACH OTHER BECAUSE THERE ARE

01:10:21.483 --> 01:10:22.484
MULTIPLE --

01:10:22.551 --> 01:10:25.688
LEAD AGENCIES AND OF COURSE

01:10:25.754 --> 01:10:26.255
FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES THAT WE

01:10:26.322 --> 01:10:27.923
HAVE TO WORK AND SO I THINK I'LL

01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:30.192
STOP THERE AND THE WHAT SO

01:10:30.259 --> 01:10:32.094
WHAT'S THE RIVER HOW DO WE

01:10:32.161 --> 01:10:32.695
WHAT'S THE METRIC.

01:10:32.761 --> 01:10:35.898
IN THIS NEW --

01:10:35.965 --> 01:10:36.665
DOES.

01:10:36.732 --> 01:10:39.168
WE HAVE ISSUE EASES REGIONAL

01:10:39.234 --> 01:10:39.702
LEADS.

01:10:39.768 --> 01:10:40.903
WHAT'S THE METRIC AND WHAT'S THE

01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:42.838
REPORTING PROCESS THAT WE HAVE

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:44.106
THE DASHBOARD FOR INDIVIDUAL

01:10:44.173 --> 01:10:46.241
SCHOOLS CRACK WHAT'S WHAT'S THE

01:10:46.308 --> 01:10:48.043
REPORTING METRIC HERE AND HOW DO

01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:49.578
WE KNOW WHETHER THIS.

01:10:49.645 --> 01:10:51.080
NEW SYSTEM IS AFFECTED BY GUESS

01:10:51.146 --> 01:10:53.949
OBVIOUSLY ONE MEASURE IS IF THE

01:10:54.016 --> 01:10:55.484
INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS.

01:10:55.551 --> 01:10:56.919
TURN FROM RED TO GREEN ON YOUR

01:10:56.986 --> 01:10:57.786
DASHBOARD.

01:10:57.853 --> 01:10:59.555
BUT THERE MAY BE REASONS OTHER

01:10:59.622 --> 01:11:00.956
REASONS WHY THEY DON'T GO FROM

01:11:01.023 --> 01:11:03.726
RED TO GREEN AND THAT MAY OR MAY

01:11:03.792 --> 01:11:06.061
NOT INDICATE OF A FAILURE OR

01:11:06.128 --> 01:11:06.462
INADEQUATE.

01:11:06.528 --> 01:11:07.997
INADEQUATE PERFORMANCE ON THE

01:11:08.063 --> 01:11:11.333
PART OF THE REGIONAL LEAD SO.

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:12.935
AT SOME POINT SOMEONE CAN

01:11:13.002 --> 01:11:14.637
ADDRESS THAT BUT SIR PLEASE

01:11:14.703 --> 01:11:15.104
PROCEED.

01:11:15.170 --> 01:11:15.971
DAVID SEVEN STABLE OF

01:11:16.038 --> 01:11:16.572
EDUCATIONAL JUST ADDRESS THAT

01:11:16.639 --> 01:11:20.142
CA MR MOLINO THAT.

01:11:20.209 --> 01:11:22.111
LEGISLATION THAT ENACT IN LAST

01:11:22.177 --> 01:11:23.612
YEAR'S BUDGET THAT ENACTED THE

01:11:23.679 --> 01:11:25.047
LEAD AGENCY STRUCTURE.

01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:26.982
INCLUDED A REQUIREMENT TO HAVE

01:11:27.049 --> 01:11:29.018
SPECIFIC METRICS THAT EVALUATE

01:11:29.084 --> 01:11:30.719
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EACH OF THE

01:11:30.786 --> 01:11:32.354
ACTORS WITHIN THE SYSTEM.

01:11:32.421 --> 01:11:33.822
SO AS MISS CORTEZ MENTIONED THIS

01:11:33.889 --> 01:11:35.524
IS JUST THE FIRST YEAR THIS THE

01:11:35.591 --> 01:11:37.326
FINAL THIRD OF GROUP OF LEADS

WERE SELECTED IN JANUARY.

01:11:38.761 --> 01:11:40.663
SO THAT PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING

01:11:40.729 --> 01:11:42.564
SORT OF WHAT THE RIGHT METRIC IS

01:11:42.631 --> 01:11:44.433
GIVENTHE DIFFERENT GROUPS FOCUS

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:45.801
OF EACH LEAD IS GOING TO BE

01:11:45.868 --> 01:11:46.802
FINALIZED BY THE END OF THIS

01:11:46.869 --> 01:11:48.570
YEAR TO BE USED THROUGHOUT THE

01:11:48.637 --> 01:11:51.206
FIVE YEAR TERM OF THE GRANT --

01:11:51.273 --> 01:11:52.241
BUT THE STATUTE ACTUALLY

01:11:52.307 --> 01:11:53.942
REQUIRED AT A MINIMUM THAT THE

01:11:54.009 --> 01:11:55.611
METRICS INCLUDE THE NUMBER OF

01:11:55.678 --> 01:11:58.047
DISTRICTS WITHIN THE AREA THAT

01:11:58.113 --> 01:11:59.948
ARE BEING IDENTIFIED FOR SYSTEMS

01:12:00.015 --> 01:12:00.883
AND WHETHER THEY'RE IMPROVING.

01:12:00.949 --> 01:12:02.451
AS A ONE MEASURE BUT WITH THE

01:12:02.518 --> 01:12:03.118
GOAL IS TO HAVE MULTIPLE

01:12:03.185 --> 01:12:04.653
MEASURES THAT LOOK AT THE

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:06.021
DIFFERENT ROLES AND FUNCTIONS

01:12:06.088 --> 01:12:09.124
THAT THESE LEAD AGENCIES HAVE

01:12:09.191 --> 01:12:09.725
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO

01:12:09.792 --> 01:12:10.192
KNOW.

01:12:10.259 --> 01:12:11.360
IF THE SCHOOLS ARE GOING FROM

01:12:11.427 --> 01:12:12.961
RED TO GREEN.

01:12:13.028 --> 01:12:14.563
WHETHER IT'S BECAUSE OF A

01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:16.398
PROBLEM AT THE SCHOOL LEVEL.

01:12:16.465 --> 01:12:18.133
OR IT IS YOU INDICATED WHETHER

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:19.768

01:15:57.719 --> 01:15:59.154
AND STARTS TO WORK WITH THEM AND

01:15:59.221 --> 01:16:00.022
DETERMINES THAT WHAT THEY NEED

01:16:00.088 --> 01:16:01.223
IS.

01:16:01.290 --> 01:16:02.124
THERE'S A RESPONSIBILITY OF

01:16:02.190 --> 01:16:03.759
THESE GEOGRAPHIC LEADS WOULD BE

01:16:03.825 --> 01:16:05.894
AVAILABLE TO KNOW WHAT THOSE

01:16:05.961 --> 01:16:06.662
EXPERTISE.

01:16:06.728 --> 01:16:08.430
ARE AND THEN BE ABLE TO MAKE

01:16:08.497 --> 01:16:09.798
SURE THAT COUNTY OFFICE WOULD

01:16:09.865 --> 01:16:11.166
HAVE THAT ABILITY TO PROVIDE

01:16:11.233 --> 01:16:12.601
THAT EXPERTISE TO THAT SCHOOL

01:16:12.668 --> 01:16:13.902
DISTRICT.

01:16:13.969 --> 01:16:16.104
THE OTHER PIECE TO IS TO MAKE

01:16:16.171 --> 01:16:17.039
SURE I KNOW I WAS JUST I WAS A

01:16:17.105 --> 01:16:19.541
FORMER COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT UP

01:16:19.608 --> 01:16:20.609
IN SHASTA.

01:16:20.676 --> 01:16:21.643
BELIEVE IT OR NOT WE ARE ONE OF

01:16:21.710 --> 01:16:22.277
THE BIGGER COUNTY OFFICE IN OUR

01:16:22.344 --> 01:16:22.644
REGION.

01:16:22.711 --> 01:16:23.779
AND SO WE A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:16:23.845 --> 01:16:25.614
RESOURCES AND SO WE HAD OTHER

01:16:25.681 --> 01:16:27.182
SOME OF OUR PARTNERS IN MODOC

01:16:27.249 --> 01:16:29.751
AND TWENTY WERE PRETTY SMALL SO.

01:16:29.818 --> 01:16:31.153
WHEN WE FIRST STARTED TO DO THIS

01:16:31.219 --> 01:16:33.388
WORK AROUND DIFFERENCES SYSTEMS

01:16:33.455 --> 01:16:34.623
WE DID QUITE A BIT OF WORK TO

01:16:34.690 --> 01:16:36.491
HELP THEM BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T

01:16:36.558 --> 01:16:36.992
HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF

01:16:37.059 --> 01:16:37.659
RESOURCES?

01:16:37.726 --> 01:16:39.027
THAT WAS JUST BECAUSE WE HAD

01:16:39.094 --> 01:16:40.862
SOME PARTNERSHIPS IS AS

01:16:40.929 --> 01:16:42.397
COLLEAGUES THIS SYSTEM.

01:16:42.464 --> 01:16:44.733
SURE ISN'T THAT WILL HAPPEN AND

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:45.267
THAT'S THE ONE THAT'S IN

01:16:45.334 --> 01:16:46.501
PARTICULAR THOSE GEOGRAPHICALLY

01:16:46.568 --> 01:16:48.503
AGENCIES ARE OUR ROLE WITHIN

01:16:48.570 --> 01:16:50.772
THAT WITH THE CD IN PARTICULAR

01:16:50.839 --> 01:16:52.908
IS SELL CORDONING FACILITATE

01:16:52.975 --> 01:16:53.241
THAT.

01:16:53.308 --> 01:16:55.610
SO WE HAD TO CHOOSE THOSE FOLKS

01:16:55.677 --> 01:16:57.846
WE HAVE TO BRING THOSE THEY'RE

01:16:57.913 --> 01:16:59.581
GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT WORK

01:16:59.648 --> 01:17:00.916
WE HAVE TO HELP THEM --

01:17:00.983 --> 01:17:02.451
TO SOME OF THE EVALUATION AROUND

01:17:02.517 --> 01:17:04.252
THAT WORK AND MAKE SURE THAT

01:17:04.319 --> 01:17:06.455
THAT SYSTEM ACTUALLY WORKS.

01:17:06.521 --> 01:17:07.356
SO I CAN ANSWER ANY OTHER

01:17:07.422 --> 01:17:08.423
QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT

01:17:08.490 --> 01:17:10.292
SYSTEMS OR JUST LOOKING AT YOUR

01:17:10.359 --> 01:17:11.059
HAND -- I'M

01:17:11.126 --> 01:17:12.127
JUST CURIOUS MAYBE IT'S THIS

INTENSIVE INTERVENTIONS NONE?

01:17:20.335 --> 01:17:22.070
YES NONE AT THIS TIME SO THE THE

01:17:22.137 --> 01:17:23.939
LEVEL TWO IS WERE AROUND THE

01:17:24.006 --> 01:17:24.906

TWO YEARS WORTH OF DATA.

01:17:28.977 --> 01:17:30.545
SO TO BE A LEVEL THREE THAT

01:17:30.612 --> 01:17:33.115
WOULD TAKE SOME TIME BE ABLE TO

01:17:33.181 --> 01:17:34.683
GET THERE.

01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:35.317
I GUESS THAT'S A GOOD THING THAT

01:17:35.384 --> 01:17:37.119

01:18:48.256 --> 01:18:49.057
PART OF THE GOAL AROUND THAT

01:18:49.124 --> 01:18:50.592
WORK IS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE

01:18:50.659 --> 01:18:52.828

MAYBE START TO HAVE SOME OF THE

01:18:56.665 --> 01:18:57.466
STRUGGLES.

01:18:57.532 --> 01:18:58.834
WILL HAVE A RESOURCE FOR SOME

01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:00.969
PRACTICES WERE WE CAN BE ABLE TO

WERE ALREADY IN THOSE DISTRICTS.

01:19:38.573 --> 01:19:40.208
A BASED ON IN INGLEWOOD THE

01:19:59.427 --> 01:20:00.595
A BIT TO SPENDING QUITE A BIT OF

01:20:00.662 --> 01:20:01.630
TIME IN PUTTING A LOT OF

01:20:01.696 --> 01:20:02.664
RESOURCES.

01:20:02.731 --> 01:20:04.399
AND REALLY TRYING TO MAKE SURE

01:20:04.466 --> 01:20:05.834
THAT THOSE DISTRICTS ARE.

01:20:05.901 --> 01:20:06.234

ATTACKING THE ACADEMIC ISSUES

01:20:08.403 --> 01:20:09.404
WHAT WITH A FOUND IN THOSE

01:20:09.471 --> 01:20:10.839
DISTRICTS AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IS

01:20:10.906 --> 01:20:12.274
IS WHEN THERE'S FINANCIAL

01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:13.575
DIFFICULTIES STUDENTS DON'T DO

01:20:13.642 --> 01:20:14.476
AS WELL.

01:20:14.543 --> 01:20:15.810
AND SO THEY'VE SEEN OVER THE

01:20:15.877 --> 01:20:17.245
YEARS AT THE ANY DISTRICT IT'S

01:20:17.312 --> 01:20:19.614
EVER BEEN IN RECEIVERSHIP AS

01:20:19.681 --> 01:20:23.418
ACADEMIC ISSUES AS WELL SO

01:20:23.485 --> 01:20:25.020
EIGHTEEN FORTY RECOGNIZES THAT.

01:20:25.086 --> 01:20:25.554
SAID LET'S PUT CALIFORNIA

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:26.721
COLLABORATIVE IN THERE SO WE CAN

01:20:26.788 --> 01:20:28.023
WHILE WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS THAT

01:20:28.089 --> 01:20:29.324
WE CAN HELP THE DISTRICT FIGURE

01:20:29.391 --> 01:20:30.492
OUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO GET

01:20:30.559 --> 01:20:31.927
BETTER FINANCIALLY.

01:20:31.993 --> 01:20:33.495
WE CAN ALSO BE HELPING STUDENTS

01:20:33.562 --> 01:20:35.597
AT SAME TIME OFTEN THE PAST THE

01:20:35.664 --> 01:20:37.465
FOCUS IS BEEN SPECIFICALLY ON

01:20:37.532 --> 01:20:38.867
THE FINANCIAL ISSUES IN THE

01:20:38.934 --> 01:20:40.869
ACADEMIC ISSUES CONTINUE TO GET

01:20:40.936 --> 01:20:43.772
WORSE YES SO PERHAPS.

01:20:43.838 --> 01:20:44.773
PERHAPS YOU COULD NOT TO BELABOR

01:20:44.839 --> 01:20:47.075
THIS BECAUSE WE CAN DO IT SOME

01:20:47.142 --> 01:20:50.111
OTHER TIME BUT CAN YOU ENLIGHTEN

01:20:50.178 --> 01:20:52.214
ME WHY IS THAT. FOR EXAMPLE IN A

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:56.084
DISTRICT IT'S IN RECEIVERSHIP --

01:20:56.151 --> 01:20:57.485
SOME WOULD ARGUE THAT SOME OF

01:20:57.552 --> 01:20:58.954
THEM WERE IN RECEIVERSHIP

01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:01.156
BECAUSE OF THE IMHO USE THAT

01:21:01.223 --> 01:21:02.791
WERE NEGOTIATED IN THE SALARY

01:21:02.857 --> 01:21:04.292
AND BENEFIT PACKAGES THAT WERE

01:21:04.359 --> 01:21:06.561
PAID. TO A VARIETY OF FOLKS FROM

01:21:06.628 --> 01:21:09.898
THE TOP TO THE BOTTOM.

01:21:09.965 --> 01:21:12.067
OTHERS CAN HAVE THAT DEBATE BUT

01:21:12.133 --> 01:21:14.002
TEACHERS ARE BEING PAID.

01:21:14.069 --> 01:21:16.238
IN THE CLASSROOM.

01:21:16.304 --> 01:21:18.273
EDUCATING STUDENTS HAVE YOU BEEN

01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:20.175
ABLE TO DETERMINE WHY THERE IS A

01:21:20.242 --> 01:21:23.044
DROP IN ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE

01:21:23.111 --> 01:21:24.412
UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES I

01:21:24.479 --> 01:21:25.880
UNDERSTAND THE DROP IN FINANCIAL

01:21:25.947 --> 01:21:28.383
PERFORMANCE SHOW THAT'S WHETHER

01:21:28.450 --> 01:21:29.150
SHE WISHES.

01:21:29.217 --> 01:21:30.752
BUT IS THERE IS THERE A DIRECT

01:21:30.819 --> 01:21:31.853
CONNECTION.

01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:33.488
AND HOW DOES THAT WORK THERE IS

01:21:33.555 --> 01:21:34.589
IN EVERY EVERY JUST BECAUSE THIS

01:21:34.656 --> 01:21:35.156
IS DIFFERENT THERE ARE SOME

01:21:35.223 --> 01:21:36.725
COMMONALITIES IN PARTICULAR WITH

01:21:36.791 --> 01:21:38.627
THESE DISTRICTS.

01:21:38.693 --> 01:21:39.828
MOST EARN I HAVE HAD SEVERE

01:21:39.894 --> 01:21:41.463
DECLINING ENROLLMENT INGLEWOOD

01:21:41.529 --> 01:21:43.865
FOR EXAMPLE IS LOST OVER TEN

01:21:43.932 --> 01:21:45.033
THOUSAND STUDENTS LIKE EIGHT

01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:47.235
YEARS SO THAT'S THAT'S SOMETIMES

01:21:47.302 --> 01:21:47.802
OVER A THOUSAND STUDENTS WHO

01:21:47.869 --> 01:21:48.603
YEAR.

01:21:48.670 --> 01:21:49.571
SO THEY'RE HAVING TO MAKE

01:21:49.638 --> 01:21:51.506
ADJUSTMENTS QUICKLY AND THEY'RE

01:21:51.573 --> 01:21:53.375
IN THERE OFTEN REDUCING THINGS

01:21:53.441 --> 01:21:54.776
WITHOUT.

01:21:54.843 --> 01:21:55.744
BEING ABLE TO GET SOME REAL

01:21:55.810 --> 01:21:57.212
CONSIDERATION TO MAKE SURE

01:21:57.279 --> 01:21:58.680
THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO REDUCE

01:21:58.747 --> 01:22:00.248
AND SO OFTEN THAT WHAT WE'RE

01:22:00.315 --> 01:22:01.916
FINDING IS WE'RE GOING IN AND

01:22:01.983 --> 01:22:03.551
DOING THESE ACADEMIC REVIEWS.

01:22:03.618 --> 01:22:05.520
IS THERE THERE MAY BE SOME GOOD

01:22:05.587 --> 01:22:07.155
PRACTICES ARE SOME GOOD THINGS

01:22:07.222 --> 01:22:07.889
HAPPENING THEY MAY HAVE

01:22:07.956 --> 01:22:09.524
INSTRUCTIONAL COACH IS WHAT HAVE

01:22:09.591 --> 01:22:10.825
YOU BUT THEY DON'T HAVE A REALLY

01:22:10.892 --> 01:22:13.061
STRONG DATA SYSTEM FOR EXAMPLE.

01:22:13.128 --> 01:22:18.433
SO OFTEN THE REDUCTIONS THAT

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:21.069
THEY'RE MAKING AS TO WHAT THOSE

01:22:21.136 --> 01:22:22.304
THINGS ARE IN SOME OF THOSE

01:22:22.370 --> 01:22:23.571
REDUCTIONS.

01:22:23.638 --> 01:22:24.906
COULD BE KEY TO THE SUCCESS

01:22:24.973 --> 01:22:26.641
THEY'VE HAD IN THE PAST.

01:22:26.708 --> 01:22:29.277
IN SO THE SOMETIMES REDUCING THE

01:22:29.344 --> 01:22:31.579
WRONG THINGS --

01:22:31.646 --> 01:22:32.547
AND SO THERE THE END I THINK

01:22:32.614 --> 01:22:33.648
IT'S BECAUSE I HAVEN'T RESPOND

01:22:33.715 --> 01:22:35.283
VERY QUICKLY HE ALSO THE

01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:37.052
TURNOVERS SIGNIFICANT.

01:22:37.118 --> 01:22:38.386
IN THE WOULD FOR EXAMPLE IS

01:22:38.453 --> 01:22:39.754
THEIR CABINET LEVEL TEAM RIGHT

01:22:39.821 --> 01:22:42.290
NOW THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR IN

01:22:42.357 --> 01:22:44.626
THE LAST EIGHT YEARS THE SAME

01:22:44.693 --> 01:22:46.027
PEOPLE THAT THE TABLE.

01:22:46.094 --> 01:22:47.329
THIS GOING TO TURN OVER PEOPLE

01:22:47.395 --> 01:22:49.998
LEAVE AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT

01:22:50.065 --> 01:22:51.866
THERE'S THERE'S A CREDIBLE

01:22:51.933 --> 01:22:52.467
MODERN -- IN

01:22:52.534 --> 01:22:54.502
COHERENCE IF YOU WILL THAT EXIST --

01:22:54.569 --> 01:22:55.837
SO OVER FINDING IS WE'RE GOING

01:22:55.904 --> 01:22:57.372
IN THERE IS THAT OFTEN THERE MAY

01:22:57.439 --> 01:22:58.106
BE.

01:22:58.173 --> 01:22:59.541
SOME EXAMPLES OF SOME GOOD

01:22:59.607 --> 01:23:01.142
THINGS HAPPENING BUT IT'S NOT

01:23:01.209 --> 01:23:02.977
SYSTEM ACROSS THE DISTRICT SIGN

01:23:03.044 --> 01:23:04.212
HAPPENING IN EVERY SCHOOL WILL

01:23:04.279 --> 01:23:07.182
GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE MAY SEE

01:23:07.248 --> 01:23:07.716
MORE OF THESE.

01:23:07.782 --> 01:23:09.017
IN THIS ENVIRONMENT THAT WE'RE

01:23:09.084 --> 01:23:10.385
LIVING IN.

01:23:10.452 --> 01:23:12.354
AND UNDERSTANDING THAT.

01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:13.922
EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT IS

01:23:13.988 --> 01:23:15.857
DIFFERENT DIFFERENT PRESSURES

01:23:15.924 --> 01:23:17.592
AND DIFFERENT.

01:23:17.659 --> 01:23:19.260
ISSUES DO YOU THINK WE WILL.

01:23:19.327 --> 01:23:21.529
NEVERTHELESS BE ABLE --

01:23:21.596 --> 01:23:23.832
WITH YOUR INVOLVEMENT --

01:23:23.898 --> 01:23:25.100
YOUR ENTITIES INVOLVEMENT

01:23:25.166 --> 01:23:26.935
DEVELOP SORT OF A TEMPLATE FOR

01:23:27.001 --> 01:23:28.203
HOW.

01:23:28.269 --> 01:23:32.006
SCHOOL DISTRICTS SHOULD RESPOND.

01:23:32.073 --> 01:23:33.241
THE FINANCIAL ISSUES WILL BE

01:23:33.308 --> 01:23:34.709
HANDLED BY SOMEBODY ELSE BUT

01:23:34.776 --> 01:23:36.378
HAVE THE DISTRICT SHOULD BE RID

01:23:36.444 --> 01:23:37.712
SHOULD RESPOND UNDER THESE

01:23:37.779 --> 01:23:39.247
PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES FROM AN

01:23:39.314 --> 01:23:40.448
ACADEMIC.

01:23:40.515 --> 01:23:42.050
STANDPOINT YES IN OTHER WORDS

01:23:42.117 --> 01:23:43.718
GENERALLY YOU SHOULDN'T REDUCE

01:23:43.785 --> 01:23:45.053
HERE THIS IS WHAT I NEED TO DO

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:47.789
AND SORT OF A CHECKLIST FOR

01:23:47.856 --> 01:23:50.158
SUPERINTENDENTS AS THEY AS THEY

01:23:50.225 --> 01:23:51.960
MOVE OR THE OR THE RECEIVER --

01:23:52.026 --> 01:23:53.695
AS THEY MOVE THROUGH THE SYSTEM

01:23:53.762 --> 01:23:54.896
TO TRY TO RESTORE FINANCIAL

01:23:54.963 --> 01:23:56.998
VIABILITY TO THE DISTRICT YES

01:23:57.065 --> 01:23:59.000
SIR TWO EXAMPLES OF THAT ONE IS

01:23:59.067 --> 01:24:01.936
I MENTION THESE ACADEMIC REVIEWS.

01:24:02.003 --> 01:24:03.371
OR FINDING IS WERE.

01:24:03.438 --> 01:24:04.272
WE BELIEVE THAT THE ACADEMIC

01:24:04.339 --> 01:24:05.940
REVIEWS THAT WE'RE DOING THE ANY

01:24:06.007 --> 01:24:07.442
JUST TO COULD DO SO SCHOOLS.

01:24:07.509 --> 01:24:08.309
RIGHT AND THAT OUR GOAL WOULD BE

01:24:08.376 --> 01:24:09.177
IS TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH

01:24:09.244 --> 01:24:10.612
COUNTY OFFICES TO YOU DON'T HAVE

01:24:10.678 --> 01:24:13.515
TO WAIT. TO YOUR IN RECEIVERSHIP

01:24:13.581 --> 01:24:15.083
RIGHT NOW THE COUNTY OFFICES I

01:24:15.150 --> 01:24:16.017
GUESS A IS A COUNTY

01:24:16.084 --> 01:24:18.319
SUPERINTENDENT I KNEW WHICH MY

01:24:18.386 --> 01:24:18.953
DISTRICT ARE DOING BETTER THAN

01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:19.821
OTHERS.

01:24:19.888 --> 01:24:25.160
I HAD SOME SENSE LOCALLY OF SO

01:24:25.226 --> 01:24:26.528
WE THINK THAT TOOL CAN ACTUALLY

01:24:26.594 --> 01:24:27.629
BE VERY HELPFUL TO GO IN AND

01:24:27.695 --> 01:24:30.031
MAKE SURE BECAUSE IT LOOKS --

01:24:30.098 --> 01:24:31.199
IT IT IDENTIFIES WHAT ARE SOME

01:24:31.266 --> 01:24:32.934
KEY THINGS YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE

01:24:33.001 --> 01:24:34.102
THAT YOU HAVE IN A SCHOOL

01:24:34.169 --> 01:24:34.869
DISTRICT OR MAKE SURE THE

01:24:34.936 --> 01:24:36.371
STUDENTS ARE DOING WELL

01:24:36.438 --> 01:24:37.472
ACADEMICALLY.

01:24:37.539 --> 01:24:38.573
AND WE'RE GOING TO MEASURE THOSE

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:40.775
KEY AREAS AND WE LOOK TO SEE

01:24:40.842 --> 01:24:41.843
WHAT THEY ARE DOING AS WELL IN

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:43.244
THIS AREA THEY'RE DOING FAIRLY

01:24:43.311 --> 01:24:44.879
WELL IN THIS SERIOUS EACH WEEK

01:24:44.946 --> 01:24:46.414
THIS DID THIS OR DID THIS MORE

01:24:46.481 --> 01:24:47.449
CONSISTENTLY ACROSS THE

01:24:47.515 --> 01:24:49.083
DISTRICTS SO THEY HAVE SOMETHING

01:24:49.150 --> 01:24:50.952
THEY CAN LOOK AT TO GO.

01:24:51.019 --> 01:24:52.620
AHEAD AND ATTACK THE PROBLEM NOW.

01:24:52.687 --> 01:24:55.089
SO THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE OF THE OF

01:24:55.156 --> 01:24:57.525
THE PIECE THAT WORD WITH A COLD --

01:24:57.592 --> 01:24:58.426
REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE THE

01:24:58.493 --> 01:24:59.994
OTHER PIECE OF GIVING EXAMPLES

01:25:00.061 --> 01:25:00.562
SOME OF OUR INITIAL WORK IN

01:25:00.628 --> 01:25:01.496
OAKLAND.

01:25:01.563 --> 01:25:02.397
THIS KIND OF VERY SIMILAR TO

01:25:02.464 --> 01:25:04.532
WHAT YOU WERE SUGGESTING OAKLAND

01:25:04.599 --> 01:25:05.867
IS HAVING TO MAKE SEVERE

01:25:05.934 --> 01:25:06.835
REDUCTIONS RIGHT NOW THEY'RE

01:25:06.901 --> 01:25:11.673
HAVING THE CUT.

01:25:11.739 --> 01:25:13.107
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

01:25:13.174 --> 01:25:14.542
WHICH MEANS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO

01:25:14.609 --> 01:25:16.277
CUT INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAM TOO SO

01:25:16.344 --> 01:25:17.378
ONE OF THE THINGS OAKLAND ****

01:25:17.445 --> 01:25:18.446
TO DO AND THEN AND THEN ALAMEDA

01:25:18.513 --> 01:25:20.715
COUNTY OFFICE OF THAT SAID.

01:25:20.782 --> 01:25:21.883
IS COULD YOU SIT WITH US COULD

01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:22.884
YOU LOOK AT OUR EL CAP COULD YOU

01:25:22.951 --> 01:25:23.818
LOOK AT OUR RESULTS COULD YOU

01:25:23.885 --> 01:25:25.119
LOOK AT THE AREAS IN THERE THAT

01:25:25.186 --> 01:25:25.453
YOU THINK --

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:26.287
ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THE

01:25:26.354 --> 01:25:27.589
IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE NEED IN

01:25:27.655 --> 01:25:30.291
ORDER TO MAKE TO BE ABLE TO HELP

01:25:30.358 --> 01:25:31.960
STUDENTS.

01:25:32.026 --> 01:25:33.328
AND SO WITH US TO LOOK AT WORD

01:25:33.394 --> 01:25:34.863
OVER SUGGESTING WE WOULD REDUCE

01:25:34.929 --> 01:25:35.597
AND THEN LOOK AT IS THAT THE

01:25:35.663 --> 01:25:37.265
RIGHT THING TO REDUCE.

01:25:37.332 --> 01:25:38.800
RIGHT IF WE REDUCE THAT SHOULD

01:25:38.867 --> 01:25:41.269
BE REDUCES INSTEAD BECAUSE IT'S

01:25:41.336 --> 01:25:42.637
A KEY AREA THAT'S LISTEN ARE EL

01:25:42.704 --> 01:25:43.972
CAP AND THEN HELP US AS WE

01:25:44.038 --> 01:25:44.572
DESIRE --

01:25:44.639 --> 01:25:47.108
KEPT GOING FORWARD TO MAKE SURE

01:25:47.175 --> 01:25:48.643
THAT THOSE KEY AREAS OF THEIR SO

01:25:48.710 --> 01:25:51.880
SIMILAR THOUGHT PARTNER RIGHT TO

01:25:51.946 --> 01:25:56.317
BEING ABLE THOUGHTFUL DECISION

01:25:56.384 --> 01:25:57.218
WHEN THEY'RE SITTING THERE TO

01:25:57.285 --> 01:25:58.186
MAKE THE CUTS SO JUST TRYING TO

01:25:58.253 --> 01:25:59.120
DO IT ON THEIR OWN.

01:25:59.187 --> 01:26:00.455
AND SO HOW DO YOU DISTILL ALL

01:26:00.522 --> 01:26:02.824
THIS AND AND THEN DISSEMINATED

01:26:02.891 --> 01:26:04.959
PUSH IT PUSH IT OUT AS OPPOSED

01:26:05.026 --> 01:26:06.361
TO SIMPLY POSTED ON A WEBSITE.

01:26:06.427 --> 01:26:09.764
PUSH IT OUT AS BEST PRACTICES --

01:26:09.831 --> 01:26:11.199
TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND AND

01:26:11.266 --> 01:26:12.767
COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION

01:26:12.834 --> 01:26:14.602
STATEWIDE EVERY WEEK.

01:26:14.669 --> 01:26:16.738
IN THE ACT IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME

01:26:16.804 --> 01:26:17.539
SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THE MILITARY

01:26:17.605 --> 01:26:20.542
BUT HERE IN THE WAY BACK --

01:26:20.608 --> 01:26:22.443
THERE WAS A LOT OF CROSS FEET I

01:26:22.510 --> 01:26:23.044
THINK THAT'S WHAT WE CALL IN

01:26:23.111 --> 01:26:24.779
THOSE DAYS OF BEST PRACTICES

01:26:24.846 --> 01:26:26.948
FROM BASE TO BASE FROM UNIT TO

01:26:27.015 --> 01:26:29.284
UNIT FROM COMMANDED COMMAND SO.

01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:30.785
IF I WAS ON THE WEST COAST I

01:26:30.852 --> 01:26:32.120
COULD SEE WHAT SOME COMMAND ON

01:26:32.186 --> 01:26:33.454
THE EAST COAST.

01:26:33.521 --> 01:26:35.456
WAS DOING IN VARIOUS AREAS AND

01:26:35.523 --> 01:26:37.792
pAND WHAT.

01:26:37.859 --> 01:26:39.127
THIS ESSENTIALLY WAS A BEST

01:26:39.193 --> 01:26:41.296
PRACTICE AND I COULD DECIDE

01:26:41.362 --> 01:26:43.097
WHETHER IT FIT MY PARTICULAR

01:26:43.164 --> 01:26:45.133
SITUATION OR NOT AND THEN

01:26:45.199 --> 01:26:45.934
IMPLEMENT.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.136
IT DO YOU PUSH THIS INFORMATION

01:26:48.202 --> 01:26:50.071
OUT IN A IN A IN A FORM THAT'S

01:26:50.138 --> 01:26:54.442
DISTILLED SO SOMEONE CAN.

01:26:54.509 --> 01:26:55.043
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

01:26:55.109 --> 01:26:55.677
CIRCUMSTANCES WERE AND DECIDE

01:26:55.743 --> 01:26:57.178
WHETHER IT APPLIES.

01:26:57.245 --> 01:26:58.546
YEAH ABSOLUTELY AND I WILL TELL

01:26:58.613 --> 01:27:00.181
YOU THE THE KEY TO WHAT YOU'RE

01:27:00.248 --> 01:27:02.083
SAYING I REALLY BELIEVE IS ON

01:27:02.150 --> 01:27:02.650
THE OF THIS BILL SYSTEM OF

01:27:02.717 --> 01:27:03.651
SUPPORT.

01:27:03.718 --> 01:27:06.521
THE SYSTEM WAS FORTY REALLY BILL.

01:27:06.588 --> 01:27:07.989
TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER SO

01:27:08.056 --> 01:27:08.723
THEY'RE NO LONGER WORK IN

01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:11.092
ISOLATION RIGHT IN THE KEY PIECE

01:27:11.159 --> 01:27:12.594
TO THAT IS COUNTY OFFICES.

01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:14.562
SO FOR US IN PARTICULAR OUR WORK

01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:15.597
IS.

01:27:15.663 --> 01:27:16.564
THE MORE THAT WE CAN WORK

01:27:16.631 --> 01:27:18.800
COLLECTIVELY WOULD COUNTY OFFICE

01:27:18.866 --> 01:27:21.069
WHO CAN THEN USE THOSE SAME

01:27:21.135 --> 01:27:22.704
RESOURCES TO GET INTO DISTRICTS

01:27:22.770 --> 01:27:23.705
WITHIN THEIR COUNTY THERE'S

01:27:23.771 --> 01:27:25.340
THERE'S THERE'S A MUCH BIGGER

01:27:25.406 --> 01:27:26.908
CHANCE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT.

01:27:26.975 --> 01:27:28.543
AND UP HERE OUT IN OUR OWN

01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:29.978
TRYING TO GET INTO A DISTRICT SO

01:27:30.044 --> 01:27:31.779
I REALLY THINK THE SYSTEM IS SET

01:27:31.846 --> 01:27:33.314
UP FOR THAT TO HAPPEN.

01:27:33.381 --> 01:27:35.917
IN PARTICULAR THAT WE'RE IN AND

01:27:35.984 --> 01:27:37.352
IT'S I THINK IT'S JUDY THAT US

01:27:37.418 --> 01:27:39.253
WITH THE CD ARE ARE BEING ASKED

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:40.355
TO BE WITH THEM TO HELP

01:27:40.421 --> 01:27:41.522
FACILITATE THAT SO.

01:27:41.589 --> 01:27:42.824
NOT ONLY ARE WE A FACILITATOR

01:27:42.890 --> 01:27:43.958
BUT WE HAVE RESOURCES AT THE

01:27:44.025 --> 01:27:45.893
SAME TIME WERE IN SOME SENSE

01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:47.528
COULD BE A LEAD.

01:27:47.595 --> 01:27:48.896
YOU KNOW AND SOME OF THIS WORK

01:27:48.963 --> 01:27:49.998
AROUND SYSTEMIC.

01:27:50.064 --> 01:27:51.532
SO PERIODICALLY AS PART OF THIS

01:27:51.599 --> 01:27:54.035
WHOLE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT IN YOUR

01:27:54.102 --> 01:27:58.239
ROLE IN IT YOU DO IN FACT PUSH

01:27:58.306 --> 01:28:00.108
OUT --

01:28:00.174 --> 01:28:01.376
INNOCENT SURELY DO LESSONS FOR

01:28:01.442 --> 01:28:02.443
SUCCESS WE DO A NEEDS THE

01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:03.211
EXAMPLE OF THAT IS TO IF YOU

01:28:03.277 --> 01:28:03.645
LOOK AT THE OTHER.

01:28:03.711 --> 01:28:05.013
SIDE OF THAT PIECE OF PAPER WE

01:28:05.079 --> 01:28:06.881
WE DO THESE P. L. AND NETWORKS

01:28:06.948 --> 01:28:07.982
WHICH ARE.

01:28:08.049 --> 01:28:09.083
WE HAVE FIFTY FIVE OF THEM WHICH

01:28:09.150 --> 01:28:10.251
ARE BASICALLY GROUPS OF FOLKS

01:28:10.318 --> 01:28:13.554
WITH COUNTY OFFICES IN SCHOOL

01:28:13.621 --> 01:28:15.089
DISTRICTS WHO COME TOGETHER --

01:28:15.156 --> 01:28:15.990
TRYING TO ATTACK A SPECIFIC

01:28:16.057 --> 01:28:17.291
PROBLEM WE LEAVE THAT WORK WITH

01:28:17.358 --> 01:28:18.760
THEM IN ADDITION WE'RE

01:28:18.826 --> 01:28:19.494
DEVELOPING WHAT WE CALL THESE

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:21.496
TOOLKITS YOU CAN SEE SOME OF

01:28:21.562 --> 01:28:22.830
THOSE SUBJECT AREAS.

01:28:22.897 --> 01:28:24.365
THAT ARE LISTED THERE ONE FOR

01:28:24.432 --> 01:28:25.466
EXAMPLE IS AROUND CHRONIC

01:28:25.533 --> 01:28:26.834
ABSENTEEISM.

01:28:26.901 --> 01:28:28.469
SO WE'RE LOOKING AT DEVELOPING

01:28:28.536 --> 01:28:30.705
WE'VE SOME BEST RESOURCES THAT

01:28:30.772 --> 01:28:32.206
FOLKS COULD BE ABLE TO USE OUR

01:28:32.273 --> 01:28:33.107
FREE.

01:28:33.174 --> 01:28:34.942
THE DISTRICT PARTICIPATED SAY

01:28:35.009 --> 01:28:36.778
HERE ARE SOME RESOURCES YOU CAN

01:28:36.844 --> 01:28:38.046
CONSIDER USING AROUND CHRONIC

01:28:38.112 --> 01:28:39.914
ABSENTEEISM AND COUNTY OFFICES

01:28:39.981 --> 01:28:41.549
ARE HELPING US DETERMINE THOSE

01:28:41.616 --> 01:28:43.251
AS WELL AS WE USE IN THE DASH

01:28:43.317 --> 01:28:43.951
FOR RESULTS.

01:28:44.018 --> 01:28:45.420
THE CHARTER THE TERM IN ONE OF

01:28:45.486 --> 01:28:46.821
THOSE AREAS THAT WE SHOULD TO

01:28:46.888 --> 01:28:48.623
PROVIDE SOME EXAMPLES OF SOME

01:28:48.690 --> 01:28:50.892
BEST PRACTICES.

01:28:50.958 --> 01:28:52.527
PERFECT.

01:28:52.593 --> 01:28:55.196
THANK YOU SIR YOU'RE WELCOME

01:28:55.263 --> 01:28:55.496
[inaudible]

01:28:55.563 --> 01:28:56.998
WHO'S NEXT.

01:28:57.065 --> 01:28:58.299
THE MORNING GIVE SEPARATE STATE

01:28:58.366 --> 01:28:59.333
BOARD OF EDUCATION AGAIN I'M

01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:00.702
JUST GONNA I THINK CLOSE THE

01:29:00.768 --> 01:29:01.869
UPDATE PART OF THIS BY TALKING

01:29:01.936 --> 01:29:03.037
ABOUT SORT OF HOW THESE PIECES

01:29:03.104 --> 01:29:04.572
FIT TOGETHER AND THE ONGOING

01:29:04.639 --> 01:29:06.174
WORK TO UPDATE IMPROVE THE

01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:07.675
SYSTEM AS WE GO --

01:29:07.742 --> 01:29:10.278
AS MISS COURT HAS MENTIONED THAT --

01:29:10.344 --> 01:29:12.847
I'LL SEE IF I WAS PASSED IN

01:29:12.914 --> 01:29:13.448
TWENTY THIRTEEN AND WE'RE NOW

01:29:13.514 --> 01:29:14.716
SIX YEARS THEN AND THERE WAS

01:29:14.782 --> 01:29:16.084
ACTUALLY A VERY INTENTIONAL

01:29:16.150 --> 01:29:17.785
STAGED IMPLEMENTATION BUILT INTO

01:29:17.852 --> 01:29:18.920
THE STATUTE.

01:29:18.986 --> 01:29:20.521
THE LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY PLANS

01:29:20.588 --> 01:29:21.489
THAT YOU'VE HEARD REFERENCE THE

01:29:21.556 --> 01:29:22.690
STATE BOARD WAS REQUIRED TO

01:29:22.757 --> 01:29:23.858
ADOPT THE TEMPLATE FOR THOSE

01:29:23.925 --> 01:29:27.228
PLANS AND JANET BY JANUARY OF%

01:29:27.295 --> 01:29:27.862
TWENTY FOURTEEN SO THERE'S BEEN

01:29:27.929 --> 01:29:29.030
THEIR OFFICIALLY THREE YEARS OF

01:29:29.097 --> 01:29:30.798
LOCAL PLANNING WITHOUT THE

01:29:30.865 --> 01:29:32.500
EXISTENCE OF THE DASHBOARD OR

01:29:32.567 --> 01:29:33.935
THE SYSTEM TO SUPPORT THE MISTER

01:29:34.001 --> 01:29:36.270
ON MOLINA.

01:29:36.337 --> 01:29:38.840
DESCRIBED IN THROUGH THAT --

01:29:38.906 --> 01:29:40.408
THAT THE BOARD DIG THE BOARD WAS

01:29:40.475 --> 01:29:41.509
CHARGED WITH ADOPTING THE

01:29:41.576 --> 01:29:43.244
TEMPLATE FOR THOSE PLANS IS THAT

01:29:43.311 --> 01:29:44.712
WHEN THE DASHBOARD WAS RELEASED

01:29:44.779 --> 01:29:46.314
THE BOARD UPDATED THE TEMPLATE

01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:47.749
TO ENSURE THAT THE CONNECTION

01:29:47.815 --> 01:29:49.684
AND LINKAGE BETWEEN THOSE TO SET

01:29:49.751 --> 01:29:51.152
THE EXPECTATION ALL LONG.

01:29:51.219 --> 01:29:52.854
WAYS THAT THE LOCAL PLAN WOULD

01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:54.922
BE INFORMED BY STATE LEVEL DATA

01:29:54.989 --> 01:29:56.224
RELATIVE TO SOME OBJECTIVE

01:29:56.290 --> 01:29:57.391
PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.

01:29:57.458 --> 01:29:58.559
AND IS MISS CORTEZ MENTIONED

01:29:58.626 --> 01:29:59.694
THERE TWENTY ONE MEASURES THAT

01:29:59.761 --> 01:30:01.095
HAVE TO BE TRACKED IN THIS LOCAL

01:30:01.162 --> 01:30:01.929
PLANS.

01:30:01.996 --> 01:30:03.898
HOW DO WE IDENTIFY A SUBSET OF

01:30:03.965 --> 01:30:05.166
THOSE OF THOSE YOU KNOW KEY

01:30:05.233 --> 01:30:06.400
CRITICAL MEASURES ON A STATEWIDE

01:30:06.467 --> 01:30:07.435
BASIS?

01:30:07.502 --> 01:30:08.836
AND AT THAT WOULD ACTUALLY HELP

01:30:08.903 --> 01:30:10.071
INFORM AND STRENGTH AND THE

01:30:10.138 --> 01:30:11.506
LOCAL CONVERSATIONS FOR

01:30:11.572 --> 01:30:13.141
DISTRICTS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES

01:30:13.207 --> 01:30:13.975
ABOUT HOW THEY WANT TO

01:30:14.041 --> 01:30:14.809
PRIORITIZE THE USE OF THEIR

01:30:14.876 --> 01:30:15.543
RESOURCES.

01:30:15.610 --> 01:30:17.211
SO THE CURRENT TEMPLATE FOR THE

01:30:17.278 --> 01:30:18.980
LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY PLANS

01:30:19.046 --> 01:30:21.048
REQUIRES DISTRICTS IF THEY HAVE

01:30:21.115 --> 01:30:23.050
A A RED OR AN ORANGISH FOR THE

01:30:23.117 --> 01:30:24.919
TWO LOWEST PERFORMANCE LEVELS ON

01:30:24.986 --> 01:30:25.720
ANY OF THE INDICATORS IN THE

01:30:25.787 --> 01:30:26.554
DASHBOARD.

01:30:26.621 --> 01:30:28.322
THE RECORD TO TALK ABOUT WHAT

01:30:28.389 --> 01:30:28.856
THEY'RE DOING ABOUT THAT

01:30:28.923 --> 01:30:30.525
PERFORMANCE IN ADDITION THERE

01:30:30.591 --> 01:30:31.793
ALSO REQUIRED TO ADDRESS ANY

01:30:31.859 --> 01:30:33.361
AREA WHERE THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT

01:30:33.427 --> 01:30:34.729
DIFFERENCE IN PERFORMANCE ON

01:30:34.796 --> 01:30:36.631
THOSE INDICATORS BETWEEN STUDENT

01:30:36.697 --> 01:30:37.098
GROUPS.

01:30:37.165 --> 01:30:38.332
SO AT THE CORE OF THIS IS REALLY

01:30:38.399 --> 01:30:39.300
FOCUSING ON ADDRESSING

01:30:39.367 --> 01:30:40.368
INEQUITIES INCLUDE IN IT

01:30:40.434 --> 01:30:41.836
DISPARITIES IN PERFORMANCE

01:30:41.903 --> 01:30:43.271
TRYING TO PROMOTE EQUITY AND

01:30:43.337 --> 01:30:44.839
THAT LOCAL CONVERSATION.

01:30:44.906 --> 01:30:46.274
NOW IS A PART OF LOCAL

01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:47.708
ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN TEMPLATE.

01:30:47.775 --> 01:30:48.943
DISTRICTS REQUIRED TO ADDRESS

01:30:49.010 --> 01:30:50.278
ANY AREA WHERE THERE ARE

01:30:50.344 --> 01:30:51.379
SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN

01:30:51.445 --> 01:30:52.780
PERFORMANCE AMONG STUDENT GROUPS.

01:30:52.847 --> 01:30:54.749
THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF HOW WHEN

01:30:54.816 --> 01:30:55.783
THE LAW WAS PASSED THESE PIECES

01:30:55.850 --> 01:30:58.252
WERE ALWAYS INTENDED TO OPERATE

01:30:58.319 --> 01:30:59.754
AS A SYSTEM F ELEMENTS OF A

01:30:59.821 --> 01:31:00.888
SINGLE SYSTEM.

01:31:00.955 --> 01:31:01.956
THEY WERE ROLLED OUT SORT OF

01:31:02.023 --> 01:31:03.724
INDIVIDUALLY BUT NOW WE'RE IN A

01:31:03.791 --> 01:31:05.293
PLACE THAT ALL THE PIECES ARE IN

01:31:05.359 --> 01:31:06.761
PLACE OF GOING BACK AND UPDATING

01:31:06.828 --> 01:31:11.599
AND IMPROVING THOSE. TO ENSURE

01:31:11.666 --> 01:31:12.066
THAT THEY ARE MUTUALLY

01:31:12.133 --> 01:31:16.604
REINFORCING KEY QUESTION LOCAL

01:31:16.671 --> 01:31:18.239
ACCOUNTABILITY CONTEXT.

01:31:18.306 --> 01:31:19.740
IS WERE PUSHING DECISION MAKING

01:31:19.807 --> 01:31:20.675
DOWN BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT

01:31:20.741 --> 01:31:22.210
PEOPLE KNOW THEIR CONTACTS AND

01:31:22.276 --> 01:31:23.110
KNOW WHAT WORKED BEST FOR THEIR

01:31:23.177 --> 01:31:24.345
COMMUNITIES.

01:31:24.412 --> 01:31:25.646
BUT IT'S ALSO HELPING THEM TO

01:31:25.713 --> 01:31:26.414
ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT

01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:28.316
CONVERSATIONS AND IF NECESSARY

01:31:28.382 --> 01:31:29.650
THE HARD CONVERSATIONS.

01:31:29.717 --> 01:31:31.018
ABOUT HOW TO PRIORITIZE THE

01:31:31.085 --> 01:31:32.086
RESOURCES THEY HAVE TO MEET THE

01:31:32.153 --> 01:31:33.754
NEEDS OF STUDENTS IN CLASSROOMS

01:31:33.821 --> 01:31:34.689
TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES.

01:31:34.755 --> 01:31:36.324
SO WHERE TO PLACE NOW AS WE MOVE

01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:38.192
FORWARD IMPLEMENTATION WE WE WE

01:31:38.259 --> 01:31:39.594
WE DO ANTICIPATE THAT THERE WILL

01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:40.862
BE WE WILL LEARN.

01:31:40.928 --> 01:31:42.096
IN THE SYSTEM A SUPPORT WE WILL

01:31:42.163 --> 01:31:44.365
LEARN AS DISTRICTS CONTINUE TO

01:31:44.432 --> 01:31:45.666
USE THE DASHBOARD.

01:31:45.733 --> 01:31:47.435
AND WE WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE TO

01:31:47.501 --> 01:31:49.837
ADJUST AND ADAPT TO ENSURE THAT

01:31:49.904 --> 01:31:50.872
AT THE STATE LEVEL IN

01:31:50.938 --> 01:31:52.106
CONVERSATION WITH LEGISLATORS

01:31:52.173 --> 01:31:54.041
AND OTHERS HOW ARE WE RESPONDING

01:31:54.108 --> 01:31:55.743
IN ENSURING THE STATE POLICY IS

01:31:55.810 --> 01:31:56.878
ALIGNED TO PROMOTING THAT GOAL

01:31:56.944 --> 01:31:57.845
THAT WE HAVE.

01:31:57.912 --> 01:31:59.113
WHICH IS IMPROVING OUTCOMES FOR

01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:00.615
STUDENTS IN THE CLASSROOM AT THE

01:32:00.681 --> 01:32:02.750
LOCAL LEVEL SO THAT HAVE AN

01:32:02.817 --> 01:32:04.619
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS LET ME.

01:32:04.685 --> 01:32:05.887
THIS IS A LITTLE BIT.

01:32:05.953 --> 01:32:07.288
TO BE A LITTLE BIT OFF TRACK BUT

01:32:07.355 --> 01:32:10.858
I HOPE NOT SINCE WE'RE TALKING

01:32:10.925 --> 01:32:12.560
ABOUT THE L. CAP.

01:32:12.627 --> 01:32:13.661
NO ONE OF MY CONCERNS IS OF IS

01:32:13.728 --> 01:32:16.631
LOCAL FUNDING FOR A SCHOOL

01:32:16.697 --> 01:32:18.099
COUNSELORS --

01:32:18.165 --> 01:32:20.234
PSYCHOLOGISTS IN SOME CASES

01:32:20.301 --> 01:32:22.236
NURSES -- IS

01:32:22.303 --> 01:32:24.071
THERE ANYTHING IN THE EL CAP

01:32:24.138 --> 01:32:25.273
PROCESS TODAY WITHIN THE A

01:32:25.339 --> 01:32:26.974
PRIORITIES IN PARTICULAR SCHOOL

01:32:27.041 --> 01:32:28.342
CLIMATE.

01:32:28.409 --> 01:32:30.344
THAT REQUIRES THE DISTRICTS TO

01:32:30.411 --> 01:32:32.179
HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

01:32:32.246 --> 01:32:33.214
OTHER STAKEHOLDERS PARENTS

01:32:33.281 --> 01:32:35.216
TEACHERS.

01:32:35.283 --> 01:32:36.918
A CLASSIFIED WHATEVER.

01:32:36.984 --> 01:32:39.153
ABOUT THE PRESENCE OR LACK OF

01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:40.655
PRESENCE.

01:32:40.721 --> 01:32:43.090
AND NUMBERS AND LOCATIONS OF

01:32:43.157 --> 01:32:45.393
PSYCHOLOGISTS COUNSELORS AND

01:32:45.459 --> 01:32:46.227
NURSES.

01:32:46.294 --> 01:32:47.828
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING THAT

01:32:47.895 --> 01:32:50.965
REQUIRES IT AND I'M WONDERING IF

01:32:51.032 --> 01:32:51.966
I'VE MISSED SOMETHING SO THAT.

01:32:52.033 --> 01:32:54.068
THAT.

01:32:54.135 --> 01:32:55.469
ESSENTIALLY THE NUMBER PURSUE A

01:32:55.536 --> 01:32:56.804
SUPPORT PERSONNEL IN PLATE IS

01:32:56.871 --> 01:32:58.506
NOT A METRIC THAT'S REQUIRED TO

01:32:58.572 --> 01:32:59.607
BE ADDRESSED AND THAT'S NOT ONE

01:32:59.674 --> 01:33:00.508
OF THE TWENTY ONE REQUIRED

01:33:00.574 --> 01:33:02.476
METRICS BECAUSE IT DIRECTLY

01:33:02.543 --> 01:33:03.744
RELATES I WOULD THINK.

01:33:03.811 --> 01:33:05.279
TO SCHOOL CLIMATE AND MENTAL

01:33:05.346 --> 01:33:06.347
HEALTH.

01:33:06.414 --> 01:33:08.382
AND WELL BEING OF STUDENTS ON

01:33:08.449 --> 01:33:09.650
THE KEYON CAMPUSES RIGHT I I

01:33:09.717 --> 01:33:11.352
THINK WHAT WHAT I WHAT I CAN

01:33:11.419 --> 01:33:14.455
SHARE IS IT'S IT'S NOT THAT YOU

01:33:14.522 --> 01:33:15.923
HAVE TO TALK ABOUT.

01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:16.857
IN THIS PARTICULAR POSITIONS BUT

01:33:16.924 --> 01:33:18.726
IT IS CERTAINLY AS AS YOU AS YOU

01:33:18.793 --> 01:33:20.394
NOTED.

01:33:20.461 --> 01:33:22.630
CENTER OFF IT IS SOMETHING WHERE.

01:33:22.697 --> 01:33:23.264
IF YOU TALK ABOUT CLIMATE HERE

01:33:23.331 --> 01:33:24.865
HI CHRONIC ABSENCE RATES IF YOU

01:33:24.932 --> 01:33:26.067
HAVE HIGH SUSPENSION RATES IF

01:33:26.133 --> 01:33:27.468
YOU HAVE A LOCAL CLIMATE SURVEY

01:33:27.535 --> 01:33:28.636
THAT SHOWS THAT A LOT OF

01:33:28.703 --> 01:33:29.937
STUDENTS DON'T FEEL THERE'S AN

01:33:30.004 --> 01:33:31.238
ADULT THAT CARES ABOUT THEM.

01:33:31.305 --> 01:33:32.473
THAT'S ONE OF THE REQUIRED IN A

01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:34.108
MEASURES TO BE LOOKING AT THAT

01:33:34.175 --> 01:33:36.077
THOSE ARE EXAMPLES OF WHAT'S THE

01:33:36.143 --> 01:33:37.845
ACTION THAT WE'RE GONNA TAKE TO

01:33:37.912 --> 01:33:39.213
TRY TO ADDRESS AND IMPROVE.

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:40.848
PERFORMANCE ON THAT METRIC AND I

01:33:40.915 --> 01:33:44.485
CAN ALL CAPS WE ARE SEEING THAT

01:33:44.552 --> 01:33:45.286
THAT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE

01:33:45.353 --> 01:33:46.354
CHOICES.

01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:47.822
THAT DISTRICTS ARE MAKING IN

01:33:47.888 --> 01:33:48.589
CONSULTATION WITH THEIR

01:33:48.656 --> 01:33:50.124
STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT HOW TO

01:33:50.191 --> 01:33:51.759
PRIORITIZE THEIR RESOURCES AS A

01:33:51.826 --> 01:33:53.461
WAY TO ADVANCE THE GOAL IS TO

01:33:53.527 --> 01:33:54.395
YOU -- IT

01:33:54.462 --> 01:33:55.229
YOU KNOW MAKE SOME ADDITIONAL

01:33:55.296 --> 01:33:58.232
INVESTMENTS IN SUPPORT PERSONNEL

01:33:58.299 --> 01:33:59.600
COUNSELORS NURSES IT'S BETTER.

01:33:59.667 --> 01:34:03.304
WELL GIVEN THE WHAT I UNDERSTAND

01:34:03.371 --> 01:34:04.638
TO BE THE LEVEL OF STRESS.

01:34:04.705 --> 01:34:06.674
IN ACADEMIA THESE DAYS --

01:34:06.741 --> 01:34:08.442
WHICH I WOULD ASSUME IS PROBABLY

01:34:08.509 --> 01:34:10.011
ALWAYS BEEN THERE AND HIGHER

01:34:10.077 --> 01:34:11.746
EDUCATION AT LEAST IT WAS WHEN I

01:34:11.812 --> 01:34:13.581
WAS A STUDENTS PROBABLY

01:34:13.647 --> 01:34:14.448
EXACERBATED --

01:34:14.515 --> 01:34:15.850
TOOL --

01:34:15.916 --> 01:34:17.785
GREAT EXTENT TODAY.

01:34:17.852 --> 01:34:19.553
I UNDERSTAND THAT STRESS.

01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:22.323
TODAY.

01:34:22.390 --> 01:34:23.691
EXTENDS NOT ONLY.

01:34:23.758 --> 01:34:25.526
IN THE NINE THROUGH TWELVE BUT

01:34:25.593 --> 01:34:26.794
RIGHT DOWN INTO ELEMENTARY

01:34:26.861 --> 01:34:28.295
SCHOOL.

01:34:28.362 --> 01:34:30.664
AND JUST MY PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE

01:34:30.731 --> 01:34:31.766
ON THIS --

01:34:31.832 --> 01:34:34.001
I'M NOT ADVOCATING TO ADD

01:34:34.068 --> 01:34:35.569
ANOTHER PRIORITY TO THE LOCAL

01:34:35.636 --> 01:34:37.772
CONTROL.

01:34:37.838 --> 01:34:39.673
CATEGORY PLANNING PROCESS BUT IT

01:34:39.740 --> 01:34:41.809
SEEMS TO ME WITHIN THE EXISTING

01:34:41.876 --> 01:34:43.110
ARCHITECTURE AND THE EIGHT

01:34:43.177 --> 01:34:44.745
PRIORITIES.

01:34:44.812 --> 01:34:45.679
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO

01:34:45.746 --> 01:34:47.815
REQUIRE.

01:34:47.882 --> 01:34:50.017
DISTRICTS TO HAVE A CONVERSATION

01:34:50.084 --> 01:34:52.553
WITH PARENTS AND TEACHERS.

01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:52.753
ABOUT.

01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:56.157
THE MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING

01:34:56.223 --> 01:34:58.392
OF STUDENTS ON THE CAMPUSES IN

01:34:58.459 --> 01:35:00.094
THE AND WHETHER OR NOT

01:35:00.161 --> 01:35:01.262
ADDITIONAL.

01:35:01.328 --> 01:35:03.898
MENTAL HEALTH AND RELATED.

01:35:03.964 --> 01:35:06.667
PROVIDERS NEED TO BE FUNDED OUT

01:35:06.734 --> 01:35:08.536
OF THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING

01:35:08.602 --> 01:35:09.703
MONEY THAT MOVES DOWN THE

01:35:09.770 --> 01:35:10.971
PIPELINE.

01:35:11.038 --> 01:35:13.040
AND IF IN DOING SO AND IF IN

01:35:13.107 --> 01:35:15.976
HAVING THAT CONVERSATION.

01:35:16.043 --> 01:35:17.445
ADDITIONAL FUNDING REQUIREMENTS

01:35:17.511 --> 01:35:19.480
ARE IDENTIFIED THEN THAT WOULD

01:35:19.547 --> 01:35:22.149
INFORM FOLKS.

01:35:22.216 --> 01:35:23.684
WHEN THEY COME UP HERE?

01:35:23.751 --> 01:35:25.186
AS TO WHATTHEY NEED TO BE

01:35:25.252 --> 01:35:26.987
ASKING US.

01:35:27.054 --> 01:35:28.122
FOR BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S

01:35:28.189 --> 01:35:30.057
PROBABLY NO HIGHER PRIORITY

01:35:30.124 --> 01:35:31.692
AMONG MY COLLEAGUES ALTHOUGH I

01:35:31.759 --> 01:35:33.160
HAVEN'T TAKEN A WHOLE.

01:35:33.227 --> 01:35:34.962
THEN THE THE MENTAL HEALTH AND

01:35:35.029 --> 01:35:36.363
WELL BEING.

01:35:36.430 --> 01:35:38.199
OF STUDENTS ON OUR CAMPUSES AT

01:35:38.265 --> 01:35:39.500
ALL LEVELS.

01:35:39.567 --> 01:35:41.235
AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE TALKING

01:35:41.302 --> 01:35:43.537
ABOUT YOU KNOW.

01:35:43.604 --> 01:35:45.706
THE L. CAPS SO I'M I'M I'D ASK

01:35:45.773 --> 01:35:47.274
YOU MEAN I'M.

01:35:47.341 --> 01:35:48.542
IDEAS THAT YOU TAKE A LOOK AT

01:35:48.609 --> 01:35:49.877
THAT AND SEE IF WE'VE WE'VE DONE

01:35:49.944 --> 01:35:51.445
ENOUGH.

01:35:51.512 --> 01:35:53.447
BECAUSE IF IF THE LANGUAGE IS

01:35:53.514 --> 01:35:54.815
VAGUE.

01:35:54.882 --> 01:35:57.985
THEN IT'S AN AND THE PARENTS ARE.

01:35:58.052 --> 01:35:59.386
FOR SOME REASON KNOWLEDGEABLE

01:35:59.453 --> 01:36:01.455
ABOUT IT OR AREN'T FORCEFUL

01:36:01.522 --> 01:36:02.456
ABOUT IT.

01:36:02.523 --> 01:36:03.791
THEN IT SEMS TO ME AS PART OF

01:36:03.858 --> 01:36:05.126
THE PLANNING PROCESS WE COULD

01:36:05.192 --> 01:36:06.961
HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THE

01:36:07.027 --> 01:36:09.430
SUBJECT IS NEVER DISCUSSED.

01:36:09.497 --> 01:36:12.733
AND THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE TO ME --

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:14.135
HOPEFULLY IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE TO

01:36:14.201 --> 01:36:16.370
THE FIRST FLOOR.

01:36:16.437 --> 01:36:17.972
SO THIS IS MY COMMENT OTHER THAN

01:36:18.038 --> 01:36:19.907
THAT I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS

01:36:19.974 --> 01:36:21.308

A VERY LIMITED RESOURCE YEAR WE

01:49:32.532 --> 01:49:34.301
MAY EVEN BE LOOKING AS THE LA --

01:49:34.367 --> 01:49:36.369

THINGS WE WANT WHAT ARE THE MOST

01:49:48.615 --> 01:49:49.282
IMPORTANT.

SECONDLY BECAUSE THE LCF HAS

01:49:51.551 --> 01:49:52.919

YOU NEED TO PUT MONEY INTO

01:49:56.456 --> 01:49:58.892

01:49:58.959 --> 01:50:00.126

ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT AB

01:50:02.329 --> 01:50:02.862
THIRTY NINE MISTER MERRETT SU

CHI'S BILL.

ADDITION TO THOSE PRIORITIES A

01:50:13.873 --> 01:50:16.376
SUMMARY OF THE THREE HUNDRED AND

01:50:16.443 --> 01:50:17.210
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN OUR

01:50:17.277 --> 01:50:18.078
COUNTY.

01:50:18.144 --> 01:50:20.080
THAT'S CURRENTLY GENERATED BY

01:50:20.146 --> 01:50:21.815
ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FORTY

01:50:21.881 --> 01:50:23.016
THOUSAND STUDENTS WHO ARE EITHER

01:50:23.083 --> 01:50:24.351
POOR.

01:50:24.417 --> 01:50:25.685
ENGLISH LEARNERS ARE FOSTER

01:50:25.752 --> 01:50:27.253
YOUTH IT'S ABOUT 72% OF OUR

01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:29.222
STUDENT POPULATION WE REALLY

01:50:29.289 --> 01:50:31.624
REFLECT THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE

01:50:31.691 --> 01:50:32.092
STATE.

01:50:32.158 --> 01:50:34.127
THIS DATA SHOWS FIVE BASIC WE

01:50:34.194 --> 01:50:35.729
WE'VE ANALYZE THE DATA AND THE

01:50:35.795 --> 01:50:37.163
SPENDING OF THOSE OF THOSE

01:50:37.230 --> 01:50:39.265
DISTRICTS --

01:50:39.332 --> 01:50:41.267
THERE'S FIVE BASIC AREAS WHERE

01:50:41.334 --> 01:50:42.669
THE DISTRICTS SPEND MOST OF

01:50:42.736 --> 01:50:43.770
THEIR MONEY.

01:50:43.837 --> 01:50:45.538
THE POINT IS THE WITHIN THOSE

01:50:45.605 --> 01:50:47.240
FIVE AREAS THEY'RE VERY DIVERSE

01:50:47.307 --> 01:50:48.908
AND VERY DIFFERENT IN WHAT THEY

01:50:48.975 --> 01:50:50.377
TARGET.

01:50:50.443 --> 01:50:51.611
THERE EL CAPS ARE DRIVEN IS

01:50:51.678 --> 01:50:53.913
MISTER SAP POINTED OUT TO YOU BY

01:50:53.980 --> 01:50:55.715
THE STATEWIDE PRIORITIES AND THE

01:50:55.782 --> 01:50:57.851
NEED TO TARGET OUR HIGH NEED

01:50:57.917 --> 01:50:59.586
STUDENTS AND THEY'RE DOING THAT.

01:50:59.652 --> 01:51:00.887
AND WE HAVE SUCCESS ON THAT

01:51:00.954 --> 01:51:02.756
WHICH TODAY'S HEARING DOESN'T

01:51:02.822 --> 01:51:04.491
HAVE TIME FOR ME TO GET INTO BUT

01:51:04.557 --> 01:51:06.559
MY POINT IS IS THEY'RE DOING IT

01:51:06.626 --> 01:51:08.695
IN VERY DIFFERENT WAYS --

01:51:08.762 --> 01:51:11.231
THEY'RE SPENDING THEIR TARGETING

01:51:11.297 --> 01:51:12.532
ONE EXAMPLE THE KERN HIGH SCHOOL

01:51:12.599 --> 01:51:14.467
DISTRICT IS THE LARGEST HIGH

01:51:14.534 --> 01:51:15.869
SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE STATE.

01:51:15.935 --> 01:51:18.138
THERE SPENDING ALMOST 15% OF

01:51:18.204 --> 01:51:19.205
THEIR SUPPLEMENTAL IN

01:51:19.272 --> 01:51:20.707
CONCENTRATION MONEY EIGHT

01:51:20.774 --> 01:51:22.409
MILLION DOLLARS.

01:51:22.475 --> 01:51:24.811
ON CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION

01:51:24.878 --> 01:51:26.012
BECAUSE THEIR COMMUNITY AND

01:51:26.079 --> 01:51:28.248
THEIR ANALYSIS OF THEIR STUDENTS.

01:51:28.314 --> 01:51:30.150
IS THAT INVESTING IN CAREER

01:51:30.216 --> 01:51:32.685
TECHNICAL EDUCATION IS THE BEST

01:51:32.752 --> 01:51:34.788
WAY TO DECREASE --

01:51:34.854 --> 01:51:36.656
EXPULSION RATES INCREASE

01:51:36.723 --> 01:51:38.792
GRADUATION RATES IMPROVE

01:51:38.858 --> 01:51:41.428
ACHIEVEMENT ON THE PART OF THEIR

01:51:41.494 --> 01:51:42.495
TARGETED STUDENT POPULATION.

01:51:42.562 --> 01:51:44.064
THAT'S NOT TRUE OF ALL UNIFIED

01:51:44.130 --> 01:51:45.632
DISTRICTS IN THE STATE OR EVEN

01:51:45.698 --> 01:51:47.100
ALL DISTRICTS IN OUR COUNTY.

01:51:47.167 --> 01:51:49.035
BUT THEY HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO

01:51:49.102 --> 01:51:52.072
DO THAT WITHIN THE L. CFF BEING

01:51:52.138 --> 01:51:54.374
DRIVEN BY STATE WHY PRIORITIES

01:51:54.441 --> 01:51:56.342
THAT MR SAP --

01:51:56.409 --> 01:51:58.211

01:51:58.278 --> 01:52:01.781
