YOU MAY BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY MISTER COOPER. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN PROP FORTY SEVEN WAS PASSED BY BALLOT INITIATIVE. FORTY SEVEN REMOVED THE LEGAL REMEDY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT APPREHEND AND PROSECUTE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE INTENT ON COMMITTING THEFT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. ACCORDING THE CALIFORNIA PARTNER JUSTICE THE MONETARY VALUE STILL PROPERTY IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN APPROACH TO POINT PARK TO PLAY FIVE BILLION. MARK INCREASE FROM TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN OF TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. TO ILLUSTRATE THIS POINT A LARGE GROCERY STORE CHAIN REPORTED THAT TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THEY'RE COVERED ALMOST A HUNDRED SIXTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS WITH THE STORE PROPERTY FROM THIEVES. THE POINT OF THEFT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE SAME CHAIN REPORT THAT RECOVERY IN THE AMOUNT OF JUST OVER FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS. AS A TO FORTY PERCENT INCREASE OF NO FAST IN THE THREE YEAR PERIOD FROM WHEN RETAIL CHAIN. THIS PROBLEM ESPECIALLY WRECKING HAVOC R. SMALLER MOM AND POP BUSINESSES DIRECTLY SERVING MORE AFFORDABLE NEIGHBORHOODS. AS AN EXAMPLE ONE SMALLER SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GROCERY CHAIN REPORTED THAT TWENTY THIRTEEN THEY'RE COVERED ALMOST. NINE HUNDRED NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN WITH A TALL POPPY FROM THIEVES THE POINT OF THEFT. INTO SIXTEEN THE SAME CHAIN REPORT THAT RECOVERING THEM OUT JUST OVER TWENTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS. IS THERE UNDER THIRTY PERCENT INCREASE OF KNOWN FAST ME A THREE YEAR PERIOD FROM A SMALL RETAIL CHAIN. SINCE LOST CHANGE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN SERIAL THIEVES OF REALIZE THAT THEY CAN STILL UP TO NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS. PER INCIDENT. IN BE HELD TOO LITTLE OR NO CONSEQUENCES. AB EIGHT SEVEN FIVE FOCUSES ON CURBING THIS RIP ITSELF PROBLEM BY FOCUSING ON THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE REPEAT OFFENDERS. AB EIGHT SEVEN FIVE CREATING WHILE THERE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF THREE OR MORE FAST. FOR CEREAL THEFT OF THE AMOUNT OF NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS INCREASE A PATH TO HELP THOSE WHO MAY SUFFER SOME SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEMS. AB EIGHT SEVENTY FIVE WILL GIVE THE COURT THE DISCRETION TO SNIFF THE CONVICTION OF SERIAL THEFT AND COMPLETELY ERASE THE ARREST OF ANY INDIVIDUAL. WHO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE A COURT ORDERED DRUG OR ALCOHOL BE REAL REHABILITATION PROGRAM FINALLY ABA SIMPLIFIED MUST GO TO THE VOTERS FOR APPROVAL? FORTUNATELY WITNESSES TODAY JAVA FELDMAN FOR THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION AND AIR MARINO FROM THE CALIFORNIA GROCERS ASSOCIATION. FILM. CHAIR MEMBERS JONATHON FELDMAN CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. CO SPONSORS THE MEASURE. NOT SPENT THE LAST THREE MONTHS TORN THE STATE DOING LEGISLATIVE UPDATES FOR POLICE CHIEFS FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. EVERYWHERE I WENT THAT EVERY SINGLE POLICE CHIEF STORIES OF THIS IMPACT BEING REAL IN THEIR COMMUNITY THE FACT THAT THE LAWS INSUFFICIENT ALL TO THE BEHAVIOR OF THESE CAREER CRIMINALS THAT REALIZE THAT THEY CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE. OF. CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM THAT WAS MEANT FOR LOW LEVEL OFFENDERS IT WAS NOT MEANT FOR REPEAT OFFENDERS. WHEN YOU TALK TO THE CITY COUNCILS. AND THE ELECTED IN THOSE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ABOUT THIS ISSUE. THEY WHEN THEY REALIZE IT TOO AND WE TALK TO THE PUBLIC WE WE'VE LOOKED AT OF OPINIONS ON THIS MATTER. I THERE IS NOT SUPPORT TAKE CREATE LAWS THAT TREAT. REPEAT OFFENDERS THE SAME AS THAT FIRST TIME LOW LEVEL OFFENDER. WHICH IS WHY WE'VE CRAFTED THIS TO BE. TARGETED FOCUSING PRIMARILY ON REPEAT OFFENDERS. WE KNOW THAT THIS WORK BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT THE LAW USED TO BE THIS OF WHAT WE USED AS A TOOL TO GO AFTER THE FOLKS WERE CREATING MOST OF THE PROBLEMS. AND WAS EFFECTIVE SO GOING BACK TO IT IS. IS IT IS. SOME THAT WE KNOW WILL WORK AND BE A IMPACT FALL FOR THIS ISSUE YOU KNOW THE DIVERSION PIECE IS ALSO. BECAUSE WE REALIZE THAT THERE ARE FOLKS OUT THERE THAT HAVE SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEMS ALCOHOL PROBLEMS THAT NEED TO BE. A TAKEN CARE OF THROUGH TREATMENT RATHER THAN PUNISHMENT. AND THAT'S WHY WE INCLUDED THAT PIECE YOU KNOW THERE WERE SOME QUESTIONS THAT. OFFICERS HAD ABOUT WHY ALLOW IT FOR THE THIRD TIME OFFENDER NOT THE FIRST TIME OFFENDER. YOU KNOW DA'S CAN ALREADY ALLOW DIVERSION FOR FIRST TIME OFFENDERS THAT'S ALREADY AVAILABLE FOR GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT HERE. SOMEONE THAT HAS NOT BEEN DONE BEFORE TO GIVE IT FOR REPEAT OFFENDERS IS WE DO UNDERSTAND THE SERIOUSNESS OF A. DRUG AND ALCOHOL ADDICTION. YOU KNOW THIS IS THIS IS A TAILORED APPROACH AT FIXING AN IDENTIFIED PROBLEM IT'S NOT UNDOING. PROP FORTY SEVEN ITS NOT TRYING TO GO BACK TO SYSTEM MASS INCARCERATION NO POLICE CHIEF IN THE STATE WANTS THAT WAS ADVOCATING FOR THAT. BUT EVERY CHIEF THAT I'VE TALKED TO. REALIZES THAT THE ISSUE THAT WE'RE FACING IS BECAUSE OF THE THE REFORM THAT WE'VE HAD AND WE NEED CLEAN UP PIECES OF IT. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE PUSHING FOR WITH THIS LEGISLATION. THANK YOU MR FELLOW. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AYE AARON MORENO WITH THE CALIFORNIA GROWERS ASSOCIATION. TO ECHO. WHICH FILMS STATEMENT. YOU'LL NEVER ONE PRIORITY WHEN TALKING GROSS AROUND THE STATE IS DEALING WITH WITH THE INCREASED LOSSES. AND THAT OUR MEMBER COMPANIES HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH. IN RECENT YEARS. YOU KNOW WHERE'S CONSTITUENTS I MEAN MUCH LIKE CONSTITUENTS COME. LOOKING TO SOLVE A PROBLEM. AS IMAGE YOU WERE COMING AS CONSTITUENTS ASKING. THE LECHEROUS TO. OH MY KNOW MISTER CHAIR YOU'VE SAID. IN THE PAST WITH OTHER BILLS. YOU KNOW THERE'S A PROBLEM I THINK WE ALL REALIZE THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM AND AND IT NEEDS TO BE FIXED. WE BELIEVE THIS IS A VERY DISCREET FIX WE'RE NOT TRYING TO TO UNDO. ANY PREVIOUS INITIATIVES AS YOU AND I HAVE DISCUSSED IN THE PAST THAT'S NOT OUR INTENT. WE THINK THAT THIS IS A VERY FOCUSED. SOLUTION TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM. IN TERMS OF YOUR LOSSES AS MISTER COOPER. CITED IN A STATEMENT OF OUR COMPANIES HAVE SEEN LOSSES FROM TWENTY TWELVE TO DO TO PRESENT TIME THAT THAT HAVE BEEN IN SOME CASES ONE HUNDRED. AND FIFTY PERCENT ALMOST IN A PERCENT INCREASE IN LOSSES THAT. OUR COMPANIES ARE FINDING OUT THE DOOR AND MIND YOU THAT'S ONLY WHAT THE CATCH NOT DOOR I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S A PERCENTAGE OF. WHAT'S BEING LOST ALTOGETHER. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS SHOULD BE A TOOL. NOT ONLY TO ADDRESS. THE PROBLEM AFTER THE CRIME'S OCCURRED BUT WE ALSO THINK IT SHOULD BE A DETERRENT. YOU KNOW WE'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE PEOPLE COME IN THERE JUST EMBOLDENED THEY JUST COME IN AND AND. KNOWING THAT LAW IS HELD AS THEY JUST THINK THEY HAVE LICENSE TO COME IN AND TAKE TAKE STUFF. YOU MAY RECALL LAST YEAR THERE WAS A SECURITY GUARD AT A FOOD LISTEN CELLMARK. KILLED. BY SOMEBODY COMING IN. THINKING THAT THEY HAVE LICENSE TO THIS BECAUSE THE LAW HAS AS IN SKIN YOU KNOW IN A PASSIVE WAY GIVEN THEM PERMISSION TO DO THIS WITH NO CONSEQUENCES. INSTEAD OF JUST GO LAST YEAR THERE WAS A WORKER STABBED. BY SOMEBODY COMING AND TRYING TO TAKE STUFF. IN OAK GROVE ACTUALLY MISTER COOPER'S DISTRICT I WAS IN A COUPLE MONTHS AGO THERE WAS AN ELDERLY WOMAN GOT. I BELIEVE SHE WAS KILLED AT A CVS ARTICLES A WALGREEN'S IN LAGUNA. BY THIEVES YOU CAME IN. BUT THEY COULD STEAL RUNNING UP BURDEN AWAY THEY KNOCKED OVER THE KILTER. NO NO. THAT'S NOT GONNA SOLVE SOME THESE MORE VIOLENT FOLKS I GET THAT A SEPARATE CRIME BUT THE FACT THAT PEOPLE NOW KNOW. THAT YOU CAN TAKE UP TO NINE HUNDRED FIFTY. BENNETT'S. LOW RISK HIGH REWARD AYE I CAN SHARE WITH YOU VIDEOS OF PEOPLE LITERALLY. WHO COME IN THERE AND TRY TO HIDE IT THE PHILIPPA A BASKET WITH WITH BEER OR LIQUOR OR MEET AND JUST? WALK OUT THE DOOR. I'VE HAD SOME STORIES WHERE SOME OF OUR STORES WILL SAY THAT PEOPLE NOW JUST FLIP OFF. AS A WALK A DOG IS A KNOW NOTHING IS DONE. AGAIN YOU KNOW THERE'S NO PANACEA THIS IS NOT TO BE A MAGIC BULLET TO FIX ALL THESE PROBLEMS THAT BEING SAID IF THERE'S A TOOL THAT. NOT ONLY CAN DEAL WITH THOSE WHO ARE DOING THIS REPEATEDLY WHICH AGAIN. THIS WOULD ONLY BE APPLIED TO SOME WHO'S DOING OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER. BUT IF WE CAN PREVENT SOME LEASE ON THE FRONT END. WE HELPED LOSSES WE HELP WITH WORKER SAFETY. AND WE THINK THIS IS A SENSIBLE APPROACH THAT THAT PUTS ANOTHER TOOL IN THE POCKET OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TO TO HELP PREVENT AND AND DEAL WITH THESE PROBLEMS AND. WITH THAT RESPECT THE ASTEROID VOTE AND SOME POSITIVE SITUATION WHEN THE BILL IS IS A CONTRIBUTOR THINKS. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS SHOT UNDER WHAT THE CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION EXPORT. THANK YOU SIR. GOING TURN MEMBERS THEIR GOLF WITH LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. WHEN MISS SHARON CHANNEL THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. THANK YOU. TIFFANY MATTHEWS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. MORNING MRCHAIRMAN SHANE LIVING ON BEHALF OF CSL THE A FO P. ASSOCIATION OF ORANGE COUNTY DEPUTY SHERIFF SACRAMENTO DERBYSHIRE ASSOCIATIONAL LONG BEACH POLICE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU SO IT WAS THE LEVEL. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MORNING I'M KATHY SURE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA. IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN NEARLY SIXTY PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA VOTERS VOTED IN FAVOR OF PROP FORTY SEVEN REDUCING THE PENALTIES FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PETTY CRIMES. PROP 47-57 PENALTIES FOR THEFT VALUED AT NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS OR LESS AND NARROWED THE LIST OF PRIOR OFFENSES WHICH MAKE SOMEONE ELIGIBLE TO BE PROSECUTED FOR PETTY THEFT WITH THE PRIOR. A CENTRAL PART OF THE PURPOSE OF PROP FORTY SEVEN WAS STIRRED REDUCE THE NUMBER OF NON VIOLENT OFFENDERS IN CALIFORNIA STATE PRISONS. IT HAS FULFILL THAT PURPOSE AND HAS DONE SO WITHOUT PUTTING PUBLIC SAFETY AT RISK. APPROPRIATE PENALTIES REMAIN AVAILABLE FOR PERSONS CONVICTED OF THE PETTY CRIMES ADDRESSED IN A BEAST EIGHT SEVENTY FIVE INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT JAIL TIME FOR REPEAT THEFT OFFENSES. ANY EXCUSE ME. IN RECENT NUMBER SHOWS RECENT NUMBERS SHOW THAT AFTER A BRIEF PERIOD OF INCREASE. THEFT CRIMES AND ESPECIALLY SHOPLIFTING ARE ONCE AGAIN DECREASING THERE SIMPLY NO NEED TO REVISIT THE WISE CHOICE MADE BY VOTERS IN ENACTING PROP FORTY SEVEN. CALIFORNIA HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES IN RECENT YEARS IN RESHAPING ITS CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE AND TO SAVE TAXPAYER DOLLARS PREVIOUSLY WASTED ON COSTLY OVERLY HARSH CRIMINAL SENTENCES. WE NEED TO CONTINUE ON THIS PATH RATHER THAN TURNING BACK THE CLOCK WE ARE JR NO VOTE ON AB EIGHT SEVENTY FIVE. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES AND SOME IN OPPOSITION. I GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS IN THAT BROKE OUT HERE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION ALSO IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU SIR. TO BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS. LACKEY. YEAH I'D JUST LIKE TO MAKE OVER A REMARKS YOU KNOW. WITH THE RECENT IMPLEMENTATION OF PROP FORTY SEVEN WE KNOW THAT. RETAILERS HAVE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN WHAT WE CALL. WHAT WE CALL PETTY THEFT? AND I KNOW THAT. MANY MANY MANY OF THESE OFFENDERS. HAVE TAKEN THIS NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLAR THRESHOLD. PER INCIDENT. WHICH. HAS BEEN TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF UNFORTUNATELY. AND IT. IN MANY INSTANCES UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS BECOMING A WIDESPREAD PROBLEM IN ALMOST EVERY COMMUNITY THAT THAT I'M AWARE OF. AND THE PROBLEM HAS BECOME ANYTHING BUT. AND I THINK WHEN WE PASSED PROP FORTY SEVEN WE NEVER REALLY CONSIDERED THE ORGANIZED RETAIL CRIME SOPHISTICATION. AND THAT AT THIS BECOME A VERY SERIOUS THREAT TO RETELL. AND I I COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A SIMPLE REMEDY FOR A VERY VERY BIG PROBLEM. ANY OTHER. QUESTIONS. TO COOPER YOU MAY CLOSE THAT MISTER CHAIR AND POINT OUT THINGS BE COMMITTEE SO YOU TALKED ABOUT THEIR SIGNIFICANT. MEMORIES RIGHT NOW UPLAND OTHER COMMITTEE REPORT IT TALKS ABOUT CURRENT LAW PERMITS AGGREGATION THE THEFT OFFENSES. THAT IS WRONG. OKAY IT'S INACCURATE AND I'LL TELL YOU COUPLE THINGS WHY. COVERS COVERS PRE COURT RECENTLY RULED IN PEOPLE VERSUS PAGE BUT EVEN STILL IN THE MOTOR VEHICLE. UNDER NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS A MISDEMEANOR FEW DRIVE THE VEHICLE THAT IS UNDER NOT A FIFTY DOLLARS CHANCES ARE EITHER ELDERLY. POOR ON A FIXED INCOME UNEMPLOYED OR WORKING ON A MINIMUM WAGE JOB IT'S REALLY CAN AFFORD TO LOSE THOSE REALLY MEANS THE TRANSPORTATION RIGHT NOW THERE'S A MISDEMEANOR. SO WE CAME IN RECENTLY WITH THE FORCE CHECK INTO A BANK HEALTH LESSON NINE FIFTY. THE SUPREME COURT RULED IS A MISDEMEANOR. IN TWO RECENT CASES. A DISK ATTORNEYS TRIED AG THEFT. AN ATTORNEY GENERAL KAMEL HARRIS WROTE BRIEFS SUBMITTED IN THE COURTS AND THEY'RE NOW MATTERS OF RECORD. SLOW COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT CASE PEOPLE VERSUS CHENEY THE VICTIMS OF THE GAP. CASUAL MALE AND ALTHOUGH FOR ROUGHLY YOU KNOW RUN ABOUT NINE FIFTY. AND HERE'S A QUOTE FROM ATTORNEY GENERAL. THE APPELLANT THE CONVICT INDIVIDUALS ELIGIBLE FOR RECENT SINGER PROP FORTY SEVEN BECAUSE THE VITAL STOLEN PROPERTY CHARGING SEPARATE COUNTS MAY NOT BE AGGREGATED. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN DENIED HER PETITION BY AGGREGATING THE VALUE STILL IMPROPERLY INTO SHOPLIFTING COUNTS. PROP 47-57 FOR RECEIVING STOLEN PROPERTY TREES A TOTAL OF NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS. IN A SEPARATE CASE IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT PEOPLE VERSUS WALLACE THE PROSECUTION ATTEMPTED TO AGGREGATE THE CRIMES RECEIVING STOLEN PROPERTY. AND FUNCTIONS OF CREDIT CARDS THE VICTIMS WERE MALL MARTIN CHEVRON. HERE THE QUOTES THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY AGGREGATING THE LOSS OF MOUNT FROM SEVERAL COUNTS. THE APPELLANT ARGUES THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BUT CONSIDERING THE AGGIE. LOSSES FROM ALL COUNTS INCLUDING THOSE THAT WERE DISMISSED. THE COCK TRIAL COURT WAS NOT PERMITTED TO AGGREGATE THE TOTAL LOSS FOR MULTIPLE COUNTS. DETERMINE WHETHER THE NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS FISH WITHIN REACH THREE OF AN OPINION FROM THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT IS CASE LAW AS LAW RIGHT NOW. IS THAT YOU CAN'T AGGREGATE. SO HILL AWFUL TALKING ABOUT AGGREGATION COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. IT DOESN'T WORK AS FAR OWN ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. SO THIS IS CASE LAW RIGHT NOW THIS IS NOT SOMEONE TO SUMMARIZING STEPPING UP. SO YOU CAN ALBEIT THEFT SO ONE PROP FORTY SEVEN WAS PASSED. THESE THINGS ARE NEVER TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT ABSOLUTELY NOT. NO NEVER SAID THAT A STOLEN CAR. YOU STILL SOMEONE'S CAR STILL BECAUSE IF YOU'RE RICH YOU CAL EXPENSIVE PART BUT IF YOUR POOR YOUR CARS. IN EXPENSIVE IT'S A MISDEMEANOR. SOURCE THE LESSER OF A CRIME I'LL NEVER INTENDED BY THE VOTERS. COMING A PASSING FRAUDULENT CHECK BECAUSE LESSEN NIGHT FIFTY. I WAS NEVER INTENDEDBY THE VOTERS AND THAT'S WE WILL HE COMES DOWN TO WHO'S AFFECTS IS MAMA POP RETAILERS FOLKS WALKING IN. INTO IN A NEIGHBORHOOD A% UNDERSERVED NEIGHBORHOOD GRABBING CIGARETTES ALCOHOL FOOD AND WALKING OUT WITH IT. THOSE PISTOLS R. CAN AFFORD TO REPLACE THAT LET'S WE WHOSE AFFECTING AFFECTING MEMBERS HEAR US IN THIS BUILDING AFFECTING POOR PEOPLE AND THAT'S WHO'S PAYING MORE BECAUSE THE RETAILERS. PASS ON THE COSTS THE GUY REGAIN THEIR COST SOMEWHERE TO THE CONSUMERS. IN THOSE SECOND FOR THE ARE BEING DAMAGED THE MOST. THIS BILL REPRESENTS A COMMON SENSE MIDDLE GROUND THAT FOCUSES ON REPEAT OFFENDERS. OFFERS HELP TO THOSE WITH DOZENS OF THESE PROBLEMS IT PROTECTS THE CONSUMER. AB EIGHT SEVENTY FIVE PROVIDE SENSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO THE RISING LOSS OF PROPERTY BY REPEAT OFFENDERS. GET THEM HELP. AND ALSO THE BIG ISSUE IS A LOT IS CRIMES ARE UNDER REPORTED PEOPLE DON'T FILE REPORTS. YOUR CARD IS BROKEN INTO. LAW ENFORCEMENT WILDLIFE ALL REPORT WILL INVESTIGATE CAR BREAK INS AND INVESTIGATE FEST LIKE THAT LEADER MISDEMEANORS. AND FOR SOMEONE SIT HERE AND SAY SOME OF THOSE TO GO TO STATE PRISON. ON MISDEMEANORS IS VERY DISINGENUOUS IT DOESN'T HAPPEN. MISDEMEANOR SO I DON'T CARE WHAT IT IS YOU'RE THE STATE PRISON THAT'S WHAT HAPPENING. PRISON IS RESERVE FOR SERIOUS OFFENDERS NOT MISDEMEANOR OFFENDERS. COUNTY JAIL THE SAME THING. WE HAVE THE THE VERSE THE WORST IN THERE THAT'S A BIG ISSUE WITH THIS IS A PROBLEM AND NOW WITH DRUG COURT. FULL ALLERGIC CORDLESS YOU WANNA GET. YOUR REST. YOU KNOW ADJUDICATED BECAUSE YOU ARE JOB OTHERWISE DRUG COURT KNOWN BUILDING WAS NO HAMMER. BECAUSE DRUGS THE HARDEST THING TO GET OFF OF HIM BEFORE DRUGS HAVE HAMMER TO FOR SOMEONE TO GOING TO DRUG COURT AND GET CLEANED UP THEY DON'T HAVE THAT ANYMORE. SO WE NEED TO FIX THIS WE'VE ALL ADMIT THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH IT. AND ONE DENIAL HERE BUT. AGGREGATION. IN THE FOLKS THAT SAY CAN BE AGGREGATED. NONE OTHER TALK ABOUT RESPECT YASSER AYE VOTE THANK YOU MISTER COOPER AND. I WOULD RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE THAT. THAT WE DON'T BELIEVE IT IS A PROBLEM BUT. I DO GENERALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM AND SO SERIOUS PROBLEM. WHAT WE DISAGREE IS ON METHODOLOGY? AND I THINK IF WE ALL GOT INTO THE SAME ROOM AND DISGUSTED. WITH ALL LEVELS OF RHETORIC DOWN. THAT WE CAN COME UP WITH A SOLUTION. THAT AND I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO GO BACK TO PROP FORTY SEVEN THAT'S THAT'S VERY ENCOURAGING. THAT WE CAN WE CAN COME UP WITH A SOLUTION ARM MAYBE VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT MISTER COOPER IS RECOMMENDING. ON THE CHAIR UNFORTUNATELY RIGHT NOW RECKONING A NO VOTE BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED TO COME BACK TO THE TABLE. AND DISCUSS IT SOME MORE. IS THERE A MOTION. WITH THE BILL.

BILL PASSES THANK YOU CHECK THAT YOU. SO WE'RE STILL WAITING. ON TO MORE ITEMS. BABY THIRTEEN NINETY FOUR MISTER TRAVIS ALLEN FIREARMS CONCEALED. KERRY LICENSES. AND ITEM NUMBER EIGHT. AB FIFTEEN EIGHTY FOUR GONZALEZ FLETCHER FROM A LAW DNA COLLECTION MINERS MISTER ALAN. HAVE YOU SEE. ITEM NUMBER SIX AB THIRTEEN NINETY FOUR TRAVIS ALLEN FIREARMS CONCEALED CARRY LICENSES. THEY. BEAR GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M HERE TO SAY TO PRESENT AB THIRTEEN NINETY FOUR WHICH WILL STANDARDIZE R. STATEWIDE CONCEALED CARRY PERMIT PROCESS BY STATING THAT IF AN INDIVIDUAL FULFILLS THE NECESSARY REQUIREMENTS. CALIFORNIA SHALL ISSUE THEIR LICENSE. FURTHER WOULD ALLOW SOMEONE WITH A VALID CCW TO CARRY THEIR PERSONAL PROTECTION FIREARMS ANYWHERE IN THE STATE. VIOLENT CRIME IS BEEN INCREASING IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE PASSAGE% MAYBE ONE OR NINE PROP FORTY SEVEN AND PROP FIFTY SEVEN. WITH VIOLENT CRIME A FIFTEEN POINT FOUR PERCENT SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN ALONE MORE MORE CALIFORNIANS ARE CHOOSING TO TAKE ACTION. TO APPLY FOR CCW TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AS A WAY TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR LOVED ONES. AS ASSISTANCE DANCE A CALIFORNIA CAN BE ISSUED OR DENIED TO CONCEAL CARRY PERMITS BASED SOLELY ON WHERE THEY LIVE SINCE LOCAL SHERIFF'S SET THEIR OWN STANDARDS FOR LICENSING. ENTIRE COUNTIES ARE SUBJECT TO POLITICAL PRESSURE THAT IS PUT ON THAT SURE BY THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. BECAUSE OF THIS MANY COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE VIRTUALLY NO CONCEALED CARRY LICENSES GRANTED LEAVING ALL OF THEIR RESIDENTS AT RISK. FOR EXAMPLE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY ALONE THERE OVER TEN MILLION RESIDENTS GET THEIR ONLY A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE CCW PERMITS. IN THAT COUNTY. PUTTING UP ROADBLOCKS FOR LAWFUL CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. THESE ARE RESIDENTS EXCUSE ME PUTTING UP ROAD BLOCKS FOR LAWFUL CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES IS WRONG. THESE RESIDENTS WHO ARE WILLING TO WORK THROUGH A LENGTHY APPLICATION PROCESS AN EDUCATION PROCESS AS WELL AS TO HEAR TO STATE REGULATIONS JUST TO OBTAIN THEIR LICENSE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILY. IS WRONG. CALIFORNIANS MUST HAVE THE RIGHT TO PROTECT THEMSELVES NOT ONLY IN THEIR HOME. BUT WHEN THEY WALK DOWN OUR STREETS. NO GUN LAW IN THE NATION WILL DETER ANYONE WHO'S ALREADY SET ON BREAKING OUR LAWS. ILLEGALLY ACQUIRING WEAPONS OR ASSAULTING ANOTHER CALIFORNIAN. BY DENYING CCW APPLICATIONS. WE ARE ONLY HURTING INNOCENT CALIFORNIANS WHO DESERVE A RIGHT TO FEEL SAFE INNOCENT CALIFORNIANS WHO DOES NOT DESERVE THE RIGHT TO PROTECT THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR LOVED ONES. AGAIN NOT ONLY THEIR HOMES BUT WHEN THEY WALK ANYWHERE IN ANY OF CALIFORNIA STREETS. TRAGEDIES HAVE BEEN AFFECTING EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIAN WITH THE RISE IN VIOLENT CRIME. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW CALIFORNIANS THE RIGHT TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. WITHOUT I HAVE BROUGHT A COUPLE OF EXPERTS AND I'D LIKE THEM TO ALSO TESTIFY AS TO THE NEED FOR HAVING A SHALL ISSUE PERMITTING PROCESS IN CALIFORNIA FOR CW'S. YEAH. WHO WHERE ONLY AGAIN FIRST? MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE RECORD THE AND READ THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION. I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER ALLEN FOR BRINGING THIS REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION HERE TODAY. AS WE'VE TALKEDIN THIS COMMITTEE. OVER THE YEARS THURSDAY INEQUITABLE NATURE TO CALIFORNIA'S CONCEALED CARRY LAWS THE GOOD CAUSE REQUIREMENT. IS APPLIED DIFFERENTLY THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND WE FEEL THAT EVERY CALIFORNIAN EVERY LAW BY THE CALIFORNIA SHOULD HAVE THE SAME RIGHT TO SELF DEFENSE REGARDLESS OF WHERE. THEY LIVE WHETHER IT'S IN SACRAMENTO LA SAN FRANCISCO MODOK. WE FEEL THAT THERE SHOULD BE CONSISTENT STANDARD. AND CONCEALED CARRY PERMIT HOLDERS NOT ONLY IN THIS STATE BUT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY HAVE PROVEN TO BE JUST THAT LAW ABIDING CITIZENS WE SEEM TO BUY ONE DECREASE IN VIOLENT CRIME. AS THE RATE OF PERMITS HAVE GONE UP NATIONWIDE THERE'S MORE THAN SIXTEEN MILLION CONCEALED CARRY PERMITS. HOLDERS IN THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW. SO WHAT THIS BILL SIMPLY DOES IS IT MAKES OUR CCW PERMITTING SYSTEM FAIR. IT LEAVES ALL THE OTHER REQUIREMENTS IN PLACE AS FAR AS CRIMINAL BACKGROUNDS TRAINING EXETER AND JUST MAKES IT A FAIR PROCESS SO THAT SOME PERSONS ARE NOT GIVEN PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT OVER OTHERS IN THEIR INHERENT RIGHT TO SELF DEFENSE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CRAIG LIVES WITH A MAP OF THE FIREARMS POLICY COALITION UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA'S GUN CONTROL LAWS HAVE LARGELY BEEN DISCRIMINATORY WHETHER IT WAS. A AB EIGHTY IN THE IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR WHICH SPECIFICALLY SOUGHT TO KEEP AMMUNITION AND FIREARMS OUT OF THE HANDS OF INDIANS BUT THEN THERE'S THE HOUSE ACT OF NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR. WHICH AMONG OTHER THINGS PREVENTED. HISPANICS AND CHINESE FOR BEING ABLE TO PURCHASE FIREARMS UP BUT ALSO AMENDED THE CONCEALED CARRY LAW IN ORDER TO MAKE IT SUCH THAT IT'S DISCRETIONARY. IN OTHER WORDS THAT DIED THEN LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT COULD THEN ARBITRARILY DECIDE WHO COULD AND COULD NOT GET A PERMIT. AYE AND WE SEEN UNFORTUNATELY WE SEE THAT DISCRIMINATION PLAYING ITSELF OUT EVEN TODAY AS WAS MENTIONED ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY SEVEN PERMITS. IN ALL OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY A SKI COUNTING OF OVER TEN MILLION PEOPLE WHAT WASN'T POINTED OUT WAS THAT ONLY NINE OF THOSE PERMITS WERE TO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT RELATED TO THE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY. MEANING THAT AND IF YOU WERE NOT LAW ENFORCEMENT YOU WERE NOT ABLE OR YOU DID NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT GOOD BECAUSE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO OBTAIN A PERMIT. I FIND THAT TO BE A BEYOND THE DISCRIMINATORY THE THING IS THAT IF YOU ARE A LAW ABIDING CITIZEN. IF YOU ARE A CITIZEN WAS DEMONSTRATED AN ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE LAW RELATING TO USE OF FORCE UNDERSTAND HOW TO SAFELY UTILIZE YOUR FIREARM. THEN AND GONE THROUGH ALL OF THE TESTS IN THE THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO OBTAIN A PERMIT. THEN YOU SHOULD BE ABLE AND ALLOW TO EXCESS EXERCISE YOUR CONSTITUTIONALLY ENUMERATED RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS. THANK YOU THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS HAPPY NEW YEAR. INTERESTING TO BE BACK HERE AGAIN. AND THE IT WILL BE AN INTERESTING YEAR I'M SURE SEPARATE IS REPRESENTING GUN OWNERS CALIFORNIA COUPLE THINGS I WANNA. POINT OUT THAT. MY COLLEAGUES BRIEFLY TOUCHED ON. AGAIN. CCW HOLDERS NATIONWIDE ARE THE MOST LAW ABIDING CITIZENS. OF ALL CITIZENS OF ALL COMMUNITY SUBGROUPS OF ANYBODY THEY ARE THE MOST LAW ABIDING WHY WOULDN'T THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WANTING INCREASE THAT NUMBER. OF OF OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE PROVEN TO BE LAW ABIDING NOW THIS DOESN'T. STRIP LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM DISCRETION THEY STILL HAVE THE ABILITY IF THEY IDENTIFY SOMEBODY WHO IS OF. BAD MORAL CHARACTER THEY CAN STILL DENY THAT APPLICATION. BUT THAT THAT CONSTANTLY IS CONSEQUENT TO TO UP. SOMETHING THAT THAT PERSON HAS DONE TO LOSE THEIR THEIR THE WRITER THEIR ABILITY TO. TO TO GET A CONCEALED FIREARM. YOU KNOW SOMEBODY IN IN MEADOW VIEW. WHO HAS A CONCEALED WEAPONS PERMIT AND STATED CALIFORNIA? WHO NEEDS A PERMIT? IN THIS DETERRENT TO LIVE WHERE THEY LIVE IS NO DIFFERENT THAN SOMEBODY WHO LIVES IN EAST LOS ANGELES WHERE I GREW UP WHO CANNOT GET A PERMIT. OR WHAT'S SPUR CRENSHAW. OR OR. YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW PORTIONS OF OF OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY WHO CANNOT. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RIGHTS THAT THEY HAVE? AND THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THEM OR THE MOST LAW ABIDING. MISTER CHAIRMAN LAST YEAR IN IN IN A COMMITTEE HERE YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU WE WE LIKE OUR CALIFORNIA LOS. AND WE WANT TO TO. YOU KNOW FOR PEOPLE TO. AND ABIDE BY THE LAWS SO WHY NOT. OPEN THIS. US SYSTEM UP SO THAT PEOPLE CAN COMPLY WITH THE LAW AND ABIDE BY THOSE LAWS. WOULD WE FEEL THAT THIS IS A. EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THING FOR FAIRNESS. FOR EQUALITY. AND AND FRANKLY THERE THE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO NEED THEM THE MOST ARE THE ONES WHO CANNOT. GET THEM BECAUSE OF THE ARBITRARY POLICIES THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS USE OF LARGELY DICTATED BY. POLITICAL PRESSURES AND NOBODY'S RIGHTS SHOULD BE DICTATED BY POLITICAL PRESSURES WE WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLYMAN FOR BRINGING THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL. THIS TRULY IS A CIVIL RIGHTS. EQUAL PROTECTION BILL. THAT IS IMPORTANT TO EVERY LAW ABIDING CITIZEN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEM WOULD GO A LONG WAYS. TO. ALLOWING PEOPLE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES IN AN EVER GROWING DANGEROUS SITUATION I JUST HEARD ON THE WAY IN. THE WAS REPORT OF VIOLENT CRIME AND GUN DEATHS THROUGHOUT AMERICA OR DOWN. THEY'VE GONE DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY. CASH THAT'S NOT HAPPEN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT'S A SHAME IN THIS BILL COULD GO A LONG WAYS TO HELP IN THAT SO THANK YOU SENTIMENT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS COMMITTEE ROY GRIFFITH ON THE HAVE TO CALIFORNIA RIFLE PISTOL ASSOCIATION WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL IN EQUAL RIGHTS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. JIM MCMAHON STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. CAN GREEN WOOD FIREARMS TRAINER CCW INSTRUCTOR FOR FIFTEEN YEARS. STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THESE ARE GOOD PEOPLE. THEY DO NOT BREAK THE LAW. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES AND OPPOSITION GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING HAPPY NEW YEAR. HERE YOU I'M AMANDA WILCOX I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA% CHAPTERS OF THE BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE. MANY OF OUR MEMBERS HAVE LOST. LOVELAND GUNFIRE. INCLUDING MYSELF. TOMORROW SEVENTEENTH. UNIVERSE FREE OF MY DAUGHTER'S DEATH FINISHED SHOOTING RAMPAGE. SO I FEEL. LITTLE BIT EMOTIONAL THIS WEEK. THIS BILL AB THIRTEEN NINETY FOUR. HAS BEEN TRIED THE POLICIES BEEN TRIED MANY TIMES IN CALIFORNIA. I'VE MET MANY LETTERS THE SUBJECT ON THE BILL HAS FAILED AND. I HOPE IT WILL AGAIN THIS YEAR. THE KEY ISSUE IS SHOULD CALIFORNIA BECOME. A SHALL ISSUE STATE IN TERMS OF ISSUING CCW PERMITS WHERE ESSENTIALLY LAW ENFORCEMENT LOSE THEIR DISCRETION RP LEAST PART OF THEIR DISCRETION IN ISSUE THE CCW BECAUSE IT REMOVES THE REQUIREMENT OF HAVING TO THAT BECAUSE. SO SHOULD SOMEONE BE ABLE TO CARRY A LOADED HANDGUN PUBLIC BECAUSE THEY WANT TO. OR SHOULD THEY HAVE A NEED FOR DOING THAT. I WOULD OFFER THATSOMEONE CARRYING A LOADED. HITTING GUN IN PUBLIC PUTS OTHERS AT RISK IN IS NOT IN THE INTEREST OF PUBLIC SAFETY. UP WE KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT IS THE DECISION TO SHOOT. OR NOT TO SHOOT ASSASSIN A SITUATION HITTING THE TARGET NOT HITTING BYSTANDERS IS DIFFICULT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND EXPECT THAT THE AVERAGE CITIZEN WOULD PERFORM. BETTER. IT'S DOUBTFUL I BELIEVE. THEIR IT OUT IN REFERENCE TO US SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE SUPPORTERS THERE IS A LIST OF CRIMES THE MISDEEDS COMMITTED BY CCW HOLDERS. ON THE VIOLENCE POLICY CENTER WEBSITE ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT THAT LIST. THERE HAVE BEEN STUDIES THAT. MORE PEOPLE CARRYING GUNS HAS NOT. IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY FOR THOSE PEOPLE OR THOSE STATES AND IN FACT A NEW STUDY CAME OUT LAST YEAR. BY THE STE BY I WAS A STANFORD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL STUDY. THAT FOUND THAT STATES THAT ADOPTED RIGHT TO CARRY LAWS WHICH BASICALLY R. SHALL ISSUE STATES HAVE EXPERIENCE A THIRTEEN TO FIFTEEN PERCENT INCREASE IN VIOLENT CRIME. IN THE TEN YEARS AFTER ENACTING THOSE LOS FEELING SAFER WITH A GUN DOESN'T MEAN ONE. IS SAFER AND IN FACT OFTEN NOT ALWAYS BUT OFTEN BEHAVIOR CHANGES WHEN ONE CARRIES A GUN. AND THAT PERSON AND OTHERS MAY BE A GREATER RISK. I WOULD REMIND YOU OF THE SHOOTING OF TRAYVON MARTIN IN FLORIDA. I BELIEVE THAT GEORGE ZIMMERMAN'S BEHAVIOR MAY HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT HE MAY NOT HAVE FOLLOW TRAYVON AND SHOT HIM IF HE HAD NOT BEEN CARRYING A GUN. IKE KNOWLEDGE THAT AT TIMES WARILY. DEATH SELF DEFENSE SITUATION DOES HAPPEN BY SOMEONE WHO WAS ARMED. BUT I THINK. THE BREASTS. OF HAVING MORE LOADED HITTING GUNS IN PUBLIC FAR OUTWEIGH ANY BENEFIT OR PERCEIVED BENEFIT SITE URGE YOU TO OPPOSE THIS BILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU ARE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I HAVE A QUESTION BLACKIE. YEAH I WOULD I WOULD COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THE FACT THAT. THE GOOD BECAUSE PROVISIONS BEEN ABUSED. AND. AS IT IS UNFAIR CONSIDERATION HOWEVER I I DO NEED SOME SOME CLARIFICATION ON. THE PORTION OF THE BILL THAT TALKS ABOUT. AND THEN AND IT STATES THAT NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION OF LAW PERSON WHO POSSESSES A VALID. A LICENSE TO CARRY CONCEALED FIREARM IS EXEMPT FROM PERSECUTION UNDER ANY STATE LAW REGULATION THAT PROHIBITS. THE POSSESSION OF A FIREARM OR AMMUNITION WITHIN A CERTAIN SPECIFIED LOCATION. INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO. PENAL CODE ONE SEVENTY ONE FOR EXAMPLE CRIME TO BRING FIREMAN TO CAPITAL. OR FIREARMS. THE SHOW SO FORTH AND SO ON. SO THOSE EXEMPTIONS. THAT KINDA GOES BEYOND THE. GOOD BECAUSE PEACE. COULDN'T COULD SOMEONE EXPLAIN THAT TO ME. SURE. SIMILAC A THESE PLACES WHERE. THAT THERE ARE EXEMPTIONS ARE PLACES WHERE NEVER. ON GUNS AVAILABLE ESPECIALLY GUN SHOWS AND STUFF LIKE THAT THEY ARE SAFE PLACES THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ALSO ABIDE BY THE LAW ACCORDING TO THE LEGISLATURE WHO HAS DONE. SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH AND FOUND THAT THAT GUN SHOWS ARE SOME OF THE SAFEST PLACES IN THE WORLD. IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT VIOLATING THE LAW AND. THERE WOULD BE NO ADDITIONAL DANGER BY ALLOWING PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROTECT THEMSELVES TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT IN OTHER IN ALL PLACES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE PROVISIONS THAT SAY YOU CAN'T BRING IT ON THE CAPITAL. THERE ARE NOW STATES WHO HAVE OVERTURNED THAT ARE ALLOWING CITIZENS TO TO TO CARRY CONCEALED LEGALLY ON THE CAPITOL GROUNDS IN HEARINGS AND. NOTHING HAS HAPPENED. YOU KNOW IF. IF THAT PROVISION OF THE BILL IT EVEN IF IT WERE TO BE STRUCK AND AND AND SHALL ISSUE WOULD BE SUPPORTED. I THINK YOU'D PROBABLY FIND SOME SUPPORT BUT THE LOGIC IS THAT. IF YOU ARE SAYING THE PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO DEFEND THEMSELVES. OUTSIDE OF THEIR HOME. THAT WAS INDICATED BY JUSTICE SCALIA AND IN IN HELLER. CONVERSES WASHINGTON DC. ADMITTING THAT THIS HAD TO COME BACK TO THE SUPREME COURT FOR ADDITIONAL. EXPLORATION AS TO HOW FAR THAT MEANT. THEN THAT THAT KINDA TELLS YOU THAT PEOPLE REALLY SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO PROTECT THEMSELVES ANYWHERE THEY GO. PERIOD. AND AND IT ALSO CLARIFY. EXACTLY ZERO VIOLENT GUN CRIMES WERE COMMITTED TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN BY CZW HOLDERS THESE ARE THE SAFEST PEOPLE WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. THIS CONCEPT WAS JUST BROUGHT UP. BY THE OTHER WITNESS THE TESTIFIED THAT THESE PEOPLE WERE UNVEILED IN THIS TAKES AWAY TOOL OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IS ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT. TO GET A CCW THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA GUARD SO JURISDICTION OR GETTING IN YOU HAVE TO THROUGH EXTENSIVE BACKGROUND CHECK. AND PEOPLE THAT HAVE A KNOWN CRIMINAL HISTORY OR ARE AT RISK YOU NOT PEOPLE GETTING SEE CW'S THIS IS WHY IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN I WOULD REITERATE THERE WAS ZERO. INCIDENCES OF VIOLENT CRIME VIOLENT GUN CRIME COMMITTEE LIKE ANY CCW HOLDERS IN ANY OF THE THIRTY NINE MILLION RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA THESE ARE THE PEOPLE YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO BE HAVING A FIREARM. IF THERE'S AN INCIDENT. POLICE ARE TYPICALLY MINUTES IF NOT LONGER AWAY TO HAVE A CCW HOLDER IN THE CROWD THAT HAS THE ABILITY TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND TO PROTECT OTHERS THAT ARE AT RISK. COULD OF SAVED NUMEROUS LIVES IN COUNTLESS CERTAIN. THANK YOU OR ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. YEAH ALL. THIS IS JUST A COMMENT. I HAVE LOOKED AT THE DATA. SEALED CARRY PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA MAY WELL BE. ARE NOT COMMITTING. VIOLENT CRIMES OUTSIDE THE STATE THEY ARE AND I THINK THAT JUST SAYS THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT LAW NOW. FOOD IS SO IF YOU PLEASE CLARIFY THAT WHO DESERVES A COMET OKAY YONI DANCER. ARE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. INCOME. YOU MAY CLOSE MR ALLEN. YOU'RE A MUCH. CONCEALED CARRY LAWS IN CALIFORNIA ARE DISCRIMINATORY. DEPENDING UPON WHERE YOU LIVE LOCAL SHERIFFS ARE STOPPING YOUR RIGHTS TO PROTECT YOURSELF FOR INSTANCE IF YOU LIVE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. WERE OVER TEN MILLION OTHER CALIFORNIANS LIVE WITH YOU ONLY A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE PEOPLE IN YOUR COUNTY. GIVING ISSUED A CCW PERMIT DOES THIS MEAN THAT THE REST OF THE TEN MILLION PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE SAME RIGHT TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. ONCE THEY LEAVE THEIR HOME. IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN ZERO CRIMES ZERO VIOLENT GUN CRIMES WERE COMMITTED BY ANY CCW HOLDER ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE. NATIONWIDE OVER THREE MILLION INCIDENCES OF VIOLENT CRIME WERE PREVENTED. BY PEOPLE WHO ARE ABLE TO CARRY A WEAPON. CONTRAST THAT WITH ONLY SIXTEEN THOUSAND INCIDENCES OF GUN VIOLENCE OR OF OF GUN DEATHS IN THE NATION. THREE MILLION INCIDENCES OF VIOLENT CRIME WERE PREVENTED IN CALIFORNIA. THE NUMBER WOULD BE ROUGHLY ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THAT NUMBER. SO WE TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS THE ACTUAL RISK OF ALLOWING SOMEONE WHO'S GONE THROUGH EXTENSIVE BACKGROUND CHECKS HAS BEEN VETTED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AND HAS NO PRIOR CRIMINAL RECORD. OF RECEIVING A CCW AND HAVING THE ABILITY TO CARRY THAT ANYWHERE IN THE STATE. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE TRULY THE FIRST RESPONDERS THESE ARE YOU THESE ARMY THIS IS YOUR WIFE YOUR DAUGHTER YOUR NEIGHBOR YOUR FRIEND. A FRIENDLY PERSON IN THE CROWD THAT HAS THE ABILITY TO NOT ONLY PROTECT THEMSELVES BUT TO PROTECT YOU WHEN POLICE ARE MINUTES OR LONGER AWAY. THE SECOND AMENDMENT. IS A RIGHT TO PERSONAL PROTECTION. THE SECOND AMENDMENT GIVES ALL CALIFORNIA CITIZENS AND ALL UNITED STATES CITIZENS THE RIGHT TO PROTECT THEMSELVES TO PROTECT THEIR FAMILIES NOT JUST IN YOUR HOME BUT WHEN YOU WALK DOWN THE STREET. IMAGINE YOUR WIFE IS GOING TO THE GROCERY STORE SHE'S IN THE PARKING LOT SHE CALLS YOU SHE'S NERVOUS THERE SOME PEOPLE IN THE PARKING LOT THAT ARE THREATENING HER. WOULDN'T YOU FEEL BETTER IF SHE HAD THE ABILITY TO PROTECT HERSELF. IN MANYCOUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA SHE DOES SHE CAN GET THE CCW ISSUED BUT IN MANY OTHER COUNTIES SHE CANNOT. IN LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO THE RESIDENTS OF THE RESIDENCES THE RED I'M SO IN LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO THE RESIDENTS OF THESE COUNTIES ARE LEFT UNPROTECTED. THEY DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN CCW PERMITS. BECAUSE THERE LOCAL SHERIFF'S. ONE ISSUE THESE. THE CONCEPT OF GOOD CAUSE AS BEEN OVER USED AND ABUSED BY LIBERAL. OR IDEOLOGICAL SHARES. THEY HAVE A PREDISPOSITION TO NOT ALLOWING THEIR LAW BITING CITIZENS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. THIS IS WRONG THIS IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL THIS SHOULD BE CORRECTED. THIS BILL DOES EXACTLY THAT THIS BILL WOULD MAKE CALIFORNIA A SHALL ISSUE CCW STATE IT'S ABOUT TIME WE GIVE CALIFORNIANS THE RIGHT TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR LOVED ONES. THANK YOU MR ON. ACTUALLY IT YOU MADE SOME GOOD POINTS IN AND. AND IN EUROPE THE PROPONENTS OF YOUR THAT MADE SOME GOOD POINTS EVEN MISTER DILUTES WHO WHO EDUCATED US. WHAT HAPPENED IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR BUT I WOULD? ALSO HAVE YOU COME TO MY OFFICE I HAVE A PICTURE OF THE BLACK PANTHERS. BROUGHT GUNS INTO HIS BUILDING AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER. THAT WAS OUTLAWED SO I UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT DISCRIMINATORY. TOWARD PEOPLE AYE. AYE I GET THAT. BUT THE MOST COMPELLING THING. THAT THAT YOU SAID AND IF YOU'VE REPEATED OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS THAT CCW HOLDERS AND CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA RACKET ZERO. PROBLEMS WHICH SAYS TO ME EXISTING LAWS THAT WE HAVE MUST BE PRETTY GOOD IF YOU HAVE A ZERO CC W. HOLDERS. COMMITTING CRIMES FOR DOING SOME EVEN THE MOST HORRENDOUS STINKS THAT WEEKS WE'VE SEEN NOW. AND I WOULD RATHER HAVE. SOME YOU KNOW DEPUTY CHIEF. LACKEY AND HELMET DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT SOMEBODY IN THAT LOCAL COMMUNITY. GETS A CCW BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT PERSON. I DON'T. OUT OF LOS ANGELES AND SO HAVING LAW ENFORCEMENT ON MONICA THAT I THINK IS REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY CRITICAL AND IMPORTANT. I ALSO THINK IT'S. IT'S THE REASON WHY WE HAD SUCH A SUCCESS WITH CCW HOLDERS IN CALIFORNIA. I DON'T THINK THIS BILL. HELP US WITH THAT AND THE FACT THAT THE MAY EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM. AND SO I WOULD HAVE TO RESPECTFULLY. ASK FOR A NO VOTE MAKE COLORADO. LEFT. I KNEW IT WAS COMING BUT NO IT. AB THIRTEEN NINETY FOR THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. NAY JONES SAWYER NAY LACKEY. LACKEY AYE KOREA. CORREO NAY GONZALEZ FLETCHER. GONZALEZ FLETCHER NO KILEY. KILEY NOT BOATING QUIRK. NO QUIRK NOW SANTIAGO. SANTIAGO NO.

IT DOES NOT INCLUDE BRED A BREATHALYZER IS NOT I DON'T BELIEVE IN ANY. HE SLOB A BIOLOGICAL SAMPLE AM I WILL CLARIFY THAT PETA IT DOES INCLUDE BLOOD IT THAT WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION YESTERDAY. AND SOMETHING WE MAY CONSIDER. WORKING ON THE OTHER THING IN ALL HONESTY BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS IS IF WE HAVE. LAWS ABOUT THE USE OF MARIJUANA OR DRUG TESTING AND DRIVING IN WE MAY HAVE TO MAKE. SOME EXCLUSIONS ON AYE COLLECTING BUT NOT STORY IN. THAT TYPE UP WHAT. OKAY I I MEAN I AM NOT TRYING TO PRECLUDE IT IT'S A STRANGE SITUATION RIGHT BECAUSE IT COULD BE EXCULPATORY UNSETTLE YOU WOULD WANT. SOMEBODY WHO SAYS YOU KNOW. A KID. THINKING THROUGH FACT PATTERN WHO. IS DRIVING ERRATICALLY GETS PULLED OVER DOESN'T BLOW UMPIRE FOR WHATEVER REASON OUR DOESN'T PASS THE TEST BUT DOESN'T BLOW IT AND THEY WANT TO DO BLOOD IN THAT. MAYBE THEIR MEDS ARE OFTEN SO YOU KNOW WE WANT TO PROVIDE THAT OPPORTUNITY. FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO AND THAT'S BECAUSE SITUATION IT'S GONNA TAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE CLARIFICATION I'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOUR OFFICE BECAUSE I I KNOW THAT YOU'RE. YOU'RE FORWARD THINKING ON THIS TOO ADAM ESPECIALLY WITH DRIVING SO BE HAPPY OR FREE OFFICE AND HOW WE DO THAT WAS SO MAINTAINING THAT THE PRIVACY OF THE MINOR THE FROM THE CORNER WORKING WITH HIM. THINK. ARE YOU ARE SMALL I THINK I'M OKAY WITH THIS TOO. DE YOU MENTION THE FOURTH AMENDMENT IN THE ANALYSIS OF THIS ORDER PART OF YOU OFFER STATEMENT I THINK IS IT IS IT YOUR VIEW THAT THIS IS. FOURTH AMENDMENT ISSUE IS KIND OF GOING I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT POLICY. I DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS IN THE AUTHOR STATEMENT I COULD BE WRONG IT MIGHT BE AN ANALYSIS. MAYBE THAT HOUSE IMMIGRANT MAYBE. LOOK AT IT REGARDLESS OF THE FOURTH AMENDMENT. IT'S HIGHLY OFFENSIVE FOR ME AS A MOTHER OF A TEENAGER. TO TO THINK ABOUT HIM WALKING DOWN THE STREET LITERALLY BEEN STOPPED BY POLICE OFFICER THIS HAPPENED IN MY DISTRICT IT. AT THE POOL THAT MY SON GOES TO EVERYDAY. KID FOR WEARING BLUE WAS STOPPED ANNOUNCED FOR DNA SAMPLE IN A KID. IS JUST SIGNED AWAY THEIR CONSENT BECAUSE I MEAN MY MY SON'S FATHER CHP OFFICER POLICE TOLD HIM HEY SIGNED THIS AND GIVE US A A SWAB YOUR TO HE WOULD DO IT. IT'S WRONG AND AND WE HAVE TO START TO PROTECT. OUR YOUNG FOLKS PRIVACY AS MUCH AS WE CARE ABOUT. AROUND AND SO. YEAH IT'S KIND OF AYE INTERESTING ISSUE BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS YOU KNOW QUESTION OF PARENTAL CONSENT AND DIFFERENT CONTACTS. WE'RE DEALING WITH MINORS. INCLUDING WITHIN CRIMINAL CONTACTS DAD YOU NEED PRODUCTION SENT. TO BEGIN QUESTIONING I DON'T BELIEVE SO SO I JUST KIND OF WONDERING WHAT. IN YOUR VIEW IS KIND OF THE STANDARD FOR WHAT WE SEPARATE THINGS THAT REQUIRE PARENTAL CONSENT FROM. THOSE THAT DOWN AND WHY DOES THIS FALL ON ONE PARTICULAR SIDELINED. MY AYE I ANTICIPATED. THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE THIS QUESTION I THINK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE HEALTH DECISIONS PEOPLE MAKE WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT I'M NOT OKAY WAS BROUGHT UP BY OUR STAFF SO. TO BE CLEAR. I I THINK THAT IN AREAS WHERE THERE IS AN ABILITY TO I'M HAVE SELF DETERMINATION BY YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY'RE HEALTH DECISIONS THAT'S ONE THING. WHERE THEY'RE BEING COERCED AND AND THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN TELL ME THAT YOUNG PERSON IS NOT BEING COERCED WHEN A POLICE OFFICER STOPS A MOUSE THEM TO? CONSENT TO SOMETHING THAT THAT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SITUATION IT WAS THE SAME SITUATION WITH I THINK LAST YEAR WE DID THE MIRANDA RIGHTS ISSUE. EIGHT THAT THE THE. AUTHORITY FIGURE. COMING AND ASKING THEM TO CONSENTED SOMETHING THAT WE'VE TOLD HOPEFULLY MOST OF US HAVE. NOW MY NEIGHBORHOODS A LITTLE BIT MORE BEGRUDGINGLY BUT TOLD PEOPLE TO. TO TRUST THE POLICE AND AND TO DO WHAT THEY SAY. I THINK WE HAVEN'T PROVIDED OUR YOUNG PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO. CONSENT FULL DISCLOSURE. IN MEDICAL SITUATIONS I THINK. IN PARTICULAR WITH. YOUNG PERSONS RIGHT TO MAKE MEDICAL DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES IT'S A AT COMPLEX COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SITUATION WHERE THEY'RE SEEKING OUT. SOMETHING BE DONE NOT BEEN COERCED TO DO IT. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT MEDICAL DECISION THAT MEAN THAT THAT'S THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD ANSWER I THINK THIS IDEA OF COERCION I'M. OF COURSE IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT SORT OF. IN HOPE OF BEING OPEN TO QUESTIONS BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AND DOESN'T REQUIRE CONSENT THAT SAME ARGUMENT FIVE SO I THINK THAT THAT. IS WHY DO I TELL NOT TO ANSWER. RIGHT AS I YOU CAN TEACH YOUR CHILD NOT CONSENT TO. AND GIVE EXAMPLES BUT I. SO I I WAS THE BILL I THINK THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE. YOUR INTUITIONS R. REPLY RIGHT I JUST THINK WE NEED A LITTLE MORE FULLY FORMED KIND OF THEORY. AS TO WIN. YOU KNOW CONSENT. SHOULD BE THERE WHEN IT SHOULD. SUCH. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENT YOU MAY CLOSE.
