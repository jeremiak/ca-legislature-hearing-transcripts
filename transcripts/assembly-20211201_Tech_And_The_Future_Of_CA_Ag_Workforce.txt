IMPLEMENT THESE PRACTICES THAT CONTINUE TO SERVE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND A SAFER MATTER. I WANT TO OPEN BY SAYING AGRICULTURE CONTINUES TO BE A MAJOR INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. OVER HERE OVER A THIRD OF THE COUNTRY'S VEGETABLES AND TWO THIRDS OF THE COUNTRY'S FRUITS AND THAT'S ARE GROWING A CALIFORNIA. AGRICULTURE IN CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO BE A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY THAT GENERATES AT LEAST ONE BILLION IN RELATED ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES. CALIFORNIA ALSO LEADS IN THE NET IN THE NATION TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS SYSTEM TO SUPPORT CUTTING EDGE DEVELOPMENTS IN THIS RAPIDLY EXPANDING AGTECH SECTOR. CALIFORNIA IS ALSO THE HOME OF THE NATION'S TOP AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE UNIVERSITIES AND ELEVEN TIER RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES THAT CONTINUE TO MAKE DISCOVERIES AND EVERYTHING FROM SEED BREEDING TO BIO FUEL ALTERNATIVES. TODAY'S ACT AGRICULTURE CONTINUES TO INTEGRATE NEW TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS AUTOMATION. ROBOTS TEMPERATURE MOISTURIZER SENSORS SALAS SATELLITE IMAGES IMAGING AND GPS TECHNOLOGY. THESE SYSTEMS ARE ALSO ALLOWING BUSINESSES TO BE MORE PROFITABLE EFFICIENT SAFER FOR WORKERS AND MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY. AG FOOD TECH AG FOOD TECH START UPS IN CALIFORNIA SAW OVER FOUR POINT NINE BILLION IN VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN BY FAR THE MOST OF ANY STATE. TWICE AS MUCH AS THE REMAINING TOP TOP FIVE STATES COMBINED AND A QUARTER OF THE WORLDWIDE TOTAL. IN ORDER FOR CALIFORNIA TO CONTINUE TO BE THE FIRST TO BE THE FOREFRONT OF TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION IN AGRICULTURAL IT WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT AGRICULTURAL INNOVATIONS THAT PREPARE THE WORKFORCE NEEDED TO SUPPORT THEM FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURAL WORKFORCE. WILL ALLOW MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THE PUBLIC TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS NEW INNOVATING SECTOR AND IDENTIFY POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE UPON IT THIS SELECT COMMITTEE ARE TO UNDERSTAND. URGING ACT TECH INDUSTRY AND DISCUSS. AND DISCUSS WHAT WE AS LEGISLATORS MAY NEED TO DO TO PREPARE THE NEXT GENERATION OF ACT TECH WORKERS. IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND WHERE WE'RE GOING WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE NEED WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING. THIS HEARING IS ONLY ONE OF THE SERIES HEARINGS THROUGH THE THROUGH THESE UPCOMING MONTHS DESIGNED TO FOR MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE. AND THE PUBLIC ON TOPICS THAT INTEREST AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER AGRICULTURE RELATED WORKFORCE. DURING TODAY'S HEARING WILL BEGIN OUR JOURNEY WITH A BROADER VIEW ON THE IMPORTANCE OF AGRICULTURE TECHNOLOGY WORKFORCE IN CALIFORNIA I WILL BE HEARING FROM. CURRENT PRACTITIONERS WHO ARE DEVELOPING AND USING ACT TECHNOLOGY IN THE FIELD. WE ALSO LEARNED ABOUT AG TECHNOLOGY CHALLENGES BARRIERS AND OPPORTUNITIES AND HOW IT IS LIKELY TO SHAPE OUR FUTURE OF AGRICULTURE WORKFORCE. WITH THIS IN MIND I WOULD LIKE TO ASK MEMBERS TODAY IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ANY OPEN REMARKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR OF ONE TO. COMMENDED THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF FOR HOSTING THIS HEARING WHEN YOU'VE OF UNIFIRST SPOKE WHEN YOU FIRST GOT ELECTED I TALKED ABOUT. THE IMPORTANCE OF TECH THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND YOU SHARED ALSO YOUR PASSION FOR MAKING SURE THAT CALIFORNIA WORKS FOR EVERYONE INCLUDING AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITIES AS WELL- AND AS- THE WORD APPLE TO ME MEANS SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TO OTHER AGRICULTURAL DISTRICTS- WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A THRIVING ECONOMY FOR EVERYONE. AND I WAS EXCITED TO BE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS HEARING TODAY IN A SPECIAL HEARING FROM A NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDERS REPRESENTING A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT IMPORTANT- MOVERS AND SHAKERS IN THIS SECTOR BUT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO. FOR US TO ALSO HEAR FROM EXPERTS IS WHAT SHOULD THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BE DOING OF COURSE WE HAVE THE LEGISLATIVE ROLE ON BILLS SPECIFICALLY BUT IN TERMS OF OVERSIGHT- THAT'S ALSO VERY IMPORTANT AS WELL SO I LOOK FOR TO THIS CONVERSATION AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT AND HELPING TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF US THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE DEEPLY COMMITTED. TO ENSURING THAT AG TECH IS WORKING FOR EVERYONE IN AND ALSO HELPING TO ELEVATE AS MANY OF THE JOBS IN THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE AS WELL TOO THANK YOU. PICTURE ANYWHERE ELSE. THANK YOU AYE ALL I WANTED TO THANK GOD THE CHAIRMAN FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE ACTUALLY AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE NOT BEEN INVOLVED IN AGRICULTURE DON'T REALIZE HOW TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED THE INDUSTRY ACTUALLY IS AND YOU KNOW IT REALLY NEEDS TO HAVE THOSE EFFICIENCIES AND HAVE LESS WASTE WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH THE PRODUCT WITH A SHELF LIFE. YOU KNOW THEY HAVE TO BE VERY EFFICIENT TO ENSURE THE GETTING IT TO MARKET GETTING IT. SAFELY TRANSPORTED AND STREAMLINE- YOU KNOW AG IS BUSY USING TECHNOLOGY FOR DECADES IN FACT- YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY WITH IRRIGATION THE PRECISE AMOUNT OF WATER FLOW RATE TO A GIVEN PLANT SAVES MONEY IS MORE EFFICIENT IT'S MORE PRODUCT YIELD AND THINGS LIKE THAT- AS AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER REPRESENTING ONE OF THE NATION'S LEADING AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITIES BELIEVE IT OR NOT SOUTH OF THE GRAPEVINE THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY WHICH- IS. LEADS THE NATION IN NURSERY CROPS AND AVOCADOS. IF THE LAW NINETEEN STARBIRD AND TENTH AND EGG LAYING HENS. SAN DIEGO IS NUMBER ONE. IN THE NATION AND PART TIME FARMERS AND SMALL FAMILY FARMS. AND NUMBER TWO IN FARMS OPERATED BY WOMEN. WITH THE WITH THE MOST PRODUCTIVE AS FAR AS NINETEENTH ON THE LIST FARM COUNTY IN THE NATION. BUT MY BIGGEST ISSUE AND ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT TO THIS HEARING IS. HOW CAN WE HELP THE SMALL FAMILY FARMS THOSE ONES THAT YOU KNOW IT'S THERE'S BARRIERS TO TECHNOLOGY THE COST OF TECHNOLOGY IMPLEMENTING IT- WE FACE MONUMENTAL ISSUES THE LABOR SHORTAGE DROUGHT WILDFIRES ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT WE CAN BE USING TECHNOLOGY. TO HELP. AND YOU KNOW A LOT OF TIMES SMALL FAMILY FARMS THEY HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER FOR A CONDOM USE A SCALE SHARING EQUIPMENT POSSIBLY IN THE PURCHASING OF IT OR- HOW THEY USE THAT. WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS TO TECHNOLOGY AND ALSO WHAT WE CAN LEGISLATIVELY DUE TO HELP. THANK YOU THANK YOU. IT'S RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I WANNA THINK THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THIS HEARING TOGETHER- I JOKE AND I VISITED- MANY MANY FORMS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND THANK YOU FOR KIND OF OUTLINING WHAT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DOES BY I EVERY TIME I AM I HAVE TOWARD SOME FARMS- PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK ME YOU'RE FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WOULD YOU KNOW D. AND MAINLY LIKE WHAT DO YOU HAVE AN AG IN YOUR DISTRICT IS THE NUMBER ONE QUESTION AND I ALWAYS RESPOND ABSOLUTELY I EAT. AND SO ALL OF US THROUGH UP AND DOWN THE STATE SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THE AG AG INDUSTRY BECAUSE WE MAY NOT HAVE A FARMS IN OURDISTRICT BUT OUR COMMUNITIES DEPEND ON THOSE FARMS TO BE FED AND- I KNOW THAT- DOES THAT CENTRAL VALLEY ARE CALIFORNIA IT SUPPLIES 60% OF THE PRODUCE FOR THE REST OF THE COUNTRY SO NOT ONLY IS THAT A CALIFORNIA ISSUE BUT IT REALLY IS A NATIONAL ISSUE OF IF OUR FARMS ARE NOT OF. YOU KNOW TAKING CARE OF IN OUR FARMERS ARE NOT TAKING CALVE AND THE WORKERS AS WELL THEN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY WILL SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES AS WELL SO I REALLY APPRECIATE ARE YOU PUTTING THIS TOGETHER AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN YOU KNOW COME UP WITH SOME SOLUTIONS ARE SOME IDEAS ON HOW WE CAN ALL WORK TOGETHER WE'RE NEVER GOING TO FIND YOU KNOW A IF WE CAN COME TOGETHER AND FIGURE OUT WHAT WE CAN DO FOR- THE FARMS IN THE STATE IN CALIFORNIA I THINK WE WILL ALL. BENEFIT BENEFIT FROM IT SO THANK YOU AGAIN AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING THE PANELISTS TODAY THANK WILL SAID MR COOPER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN APPRECIATE YOU PUTTING. THIS PANEL TOGETHER- THINK ABOUT AG THERE SO MUCH AGNES. SAID CAL. CALIFORNIA FOR NATION. THE BIGGEST INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA'S NOT TECHNOLOGIES AGRICULTURE. IT'S UPWARDS OF FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND PROBABLY A TO ME IT'S A LOT HIGHER THAN FIFTY BILLION- THAT WE FEED IT THAT'S- CALPERS BIGGEST ECONOMY AND YET WE MAKE IT SO. TOUGH ON AG AND THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES. I'VE GOT A LOT OF COMMODITIES IN MY DISTRICT- AS FAR AS GRAPES GO. 20% GRAPES GROWN IN CALIFORNIA GOING TO MY DISTRICT. AND IT'S HAVING BEEN HERE SEVEN YEARS AND BUILT OVER SIXTY TOWARDS LONG TOURS WITH MISS RUBIO. YOU KNOW WE'VE SEEN A LOT THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA HOW TOUGH IT IS. TO DO THE JOB IN THIS TECHNOLOGY COMING IN MORE MORE. WITH A WORKER. SHORTAGE IS EXACERBATED. WHAT FRUSTRATES ME FOR MY COLLEAGUES NOT FROM THE- AG REGIONS IS THIS IS THE RULES WE DO. AND THE LAWS WE IMPOSE MAKE IT SO TOUGH ON AG WE'RE DRIVES UP COSTS FOR THE CONSUMER. IT MAKES IT SO MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE I MEAN FOR INSTANCE. WHEN KERR SAYS YOU CAN'T USE THIS TRACTOR IN CALIFORNIA BUT YET. USE THAT SAME TRACTOR THE RULES IN THE STATES THE U. S. OF THE WORLD- THAT'S DIFFICULT FOR SOMEONE AG INDUSTRY TO DO THAT. SO THEY FACE A LOT OF REGULATIONS AND NOT JUST THE TECHNOLOGY BUT JUST INDUSTRIAL ON ON THE FIELD. TESTIFIED FOR A NUMBER OF USES. WORDS CALIFORNIA SPENDS TO LIVE ALREADY. THEY HAVE TO HAVE FOOD TO LIVE. THAT'S WITH THE BIGGEST COST THINK ABOUT IT IS HOUSING FOOD. THEN BAGASSE IS CRAZY RIGHT NOW TOO SO IT'S JUST IT'S SO TOUGH SO. YOU KNOW WE'RE HEADED THERE AND YOU KNOW WITH SOME OF THE FOLKS- DON'T SEE AND DON'T WANT TECHNOLOGY WILL TEAR. IN IT AND IT'S CHANGING. BUT WE'RE GOING TO HELP AG. I SAID IT'S OUR- IN THIS CAL. BUT THEY'RE TREATED THE SAME CLASS CITIZENS ON A LOT O ISSUES YOUR BILL TOWARDS AND SEEING THAT'S THAT'S- THAT'S MY THING MY COLLEAGUES THAT ARE HERE. IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU HERE IN HERE THIS AND- IT WILL BE MORE GONNA CHANGE IN PEOPLE WANT. GOOD HEALTHY CLEAN FOOD WE WANT WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO BOB FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE. ANOTHER STATE IN YOU THINK ABOUT RULES AND REGULATIONS IN THE WE HAVE SAFE FOOD HERE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT SOMETIMES WE WERE DETRIMENTAL TO THE FARMERS AND RANCHERS ARE TRYING TO THE CELL. I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM MY COLLEAGUES ON THE PANEL AND- GETTING EDUCATED THANK YOU. I DO PRE. THE COMMENTS ALTERNATE FUMER. BUT I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT A LOT OF YOU DO PUT ON THESE TOURS. AS IN MY DISTRICT. WHICH IS I'M RIGHT NEXT TO COOPER I DO HAVE- A HUMONGOUS PART OF AG YOU KNOW FROM CHERRIES TO. TO ALMONDS TO ALL GONE NOW YOU KNOW WE HAVE TOMATOES WE HAVE GRAPES- BUT WHAT I WHAT I ENJOY ABOUT THE TOURS IS THIS. AS MUCH AS I THINK I KNOW. I DON'T KNOW RIGHT I LEARNED SOMETHING ON ALL THESE TOURISTS MORE THAN EVER. I LEARNED MORE THAT THE INVESTMENT THAT THAT FARMERS PUT IN- I ALSO LEARNED THAT. YOU KNOW SOMETIMES PEOPLE THINK IT'S GENERATIONAL RIGHT THAT IT GOES ON TO THE NEXT GENERATION OF EITHER FAMILY OR KIDS. BUT EVEN THEIR KIDS ARE FEARING THAT RIGHT I MEAN I'VE TALKED A LOT OF THIS. THE NEXT GENERATION THAT THE FEAR THAT SOMEWHERE I MEAN HEARING THAT YOU KNOW THEY MAY NOT TURN TO THIS. BECAUSE THEY SEE HOW HARD. THEY OR THEIR FAMILY HOW HARD TO WORKERS HOW HARD IS EVEN THE JOB SHORTAGE- SO IT'S DIFFICULT SO I'M I'M JUST VERY THANKFUL AT SWANSEA THANK YOU TO THE MEMBERS THAT DO PUT ON THE STORES. ALL TURN TO MEMBER- AGUIAR-CURRY. THANK YU THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- HIS THIS IRONIC YES I WENT TO- WAS IN MY DISTRICT AND THEN- BRAND NEW THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR- BIOMASS PLANT IS OUT THE RICE HOLDING COMPANY IN WILLIAMS. AND THEY INVESTED THIS THEY LEVERAGE FUNDING TO DO THAT- IN THE QUESTION ONE OF THE MANY QUESTIONS I ASKED HIMBECAUSE IT'S REALLY INCREDIBLE WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS THAT. WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT YOUR WORKFORCE WE'RE GOING TO GET THE PEOPLE TO RUN THIS NEW PLANT. AND HE WAS QUITE FRANK WITH ME THIS IS THAT'S THE PROBLEM. IS TRYING TO FIND THE TECHNICAL EXPERTISE BECAUSE THESE ARE BIG COMPUTERS AND TECHNOLOGY. TO RUN THE PLANT. AND HE OBVIOUSLY SUGGESTED. LOG COMMITTEE COLLEGES NEED TO FUNNEL MORE PEOPLE IN OUR CITY AND FROM THE HIGH SCHOOLS NEED TO FUNNEL MORE KIDS IN BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE'RE USING OUR CULTURE IS REALLY CHANGING ON HOW WE DO BUSINESS- AND THE OTHER ONE IS WE TALKED ABOUT- THE SUPPLY CHAIN. AND THE ISSUE THAT'S HAPPENING AT THE PORTS AND NOT BEING ABLE TO GET OUR EXPORTS OUT. AND IF HE SAID IF THERE WAS DATA COLLECTION AND TECHNICAL EXPERTISE TO BE ABLE TO TRACK YOUR PRODUCT FROM THE MINUTE IT LEAVES OUR WAREHOUSE TO THE MINUTE IT ARRIVES. AT ITS DESTINATION IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO MAKE SURE THAT ARE A CALIFORNIA QUALITY FOR CALIFORNIA BRAND OF PRODUCTS GOT TO WHERE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO GO SO ITHINK THERE'S SO MUCH- OPPORTUNITY HERE THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT. YOU KNOW FARMERS ARE SMART A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT THEY DON'T REALLY ADHERE TO THIS BUT THEY WATCH THEIR WATER THEIR TYPE ONE LET'S JUST FACE HIGH QUALITY. AND WE DO NOT WANT TO SPEND AN EXTRA PENNY BUT WE WANT TO DO IT RIGHT SO I THINK THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE A GOOD CONVERSATION THANK. YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. THE OTHERS WILL SEE NINE- WILL WE WERE BEGIN WITH OUR- FIRST PANEL. REGRETTABLY A SECOND FOR A CARE ROSS WILL NOT ABLE TO JOIN US TO. IN PERSON DUE TO MANY OVERLAPPING- COMMITMENTS TODAY HOWEVER SHE SHE WILL SHARE A LETTER WITH THIS TO THE COMMITTEE AND SENDS HER REGARDS WILL MOVE ON TO OUR FIRST PANEL AND INTRODUCE GABBRO YOU'D SEE. CHIEF INNOVATION OFFICER AT UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES. THANK YOU SIR. GOOD MORNING BUT MY POINT IS RIGHT THE CLOSEST MICROPHONE HERE ALL RIGHT. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN- VIA FULA AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE THIS MORNING TO BEGIN THE DIALOGUE WITH YOU. MY NAME IS GABE JASSI CHIEF INNOVATION OFFICER FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES RIGHT LEAD THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF NOVEL- AGRICULTURE TECHNOLOGIES AND SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP- FOR CALIFORNIA'S FOOD NAG INDUSTRIES AT THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND THE VISION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS- WHOSE WORK IS TO ADVANCE THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY. AND STEWART ARE WORKING LANDS UP THROUGH A NETWORK OF CAMPUS AND FIELD BASED- SCIENTISTS- ENGINEERS ON NEARLY EVERY UC CAMPUS AND EVERY COUNTING CALIFORNIA- WE ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE LEGISLATURE'S RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF YOU SEE AN ARTS WORK IN THE RESTORATION OF FUNDING- THAT WILL PUT MUCH NEEDED PRACTICAL SCIENCE AND EXPERTISE- AB THE TECHNOLOGY OF PARTIES BACK IN THE FIELD TO SUPPORT THE CHALLENGING. TIMES AHEAD BUT THE OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL FOR CALIFORNIA'S AG INDUSTRY. CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE AS IT HAS BEEN MENTIONED HAS LONG BEEN THE BACKBONE OF AMERICA'S FRESH FOOD SUPPLY. PRODUCING A THIRD OF THE NATION'S- VEGETABLES AND TWO THIRDS OF THE FRUITS AND NUTS. THAT TRANSLATES INTO FIFTY BILLION IN PHARMACY TO NEARLY FIFTY BILLION BAHT- TO YOUR POINT TO WELL OVER THREE HUNDRED BILLION AND ONE POINT FIVE MILLION JOBS. ACROSS THE STATES WORKING LANDSCAPES AS WE FOUND YOU SEEN OUR FOUND IN A TWENTY NINETEEN STUDY. THESE JOBS ARE OFTEN LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA'S RURAL COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE CENTRAL SALINAS IMPROVE ALEX. HOWEVER STATE'S AGRICULTURAL LEADERSHIP AND EVEN THE ABILITY TO FEED OUR POPULATION IS UNDER THREAT DUE TO THE ONE TWO PUNCH IS A CLIMATE CHANGE A SHRINKING WORKFORCE. AND COMPETITION FROM MEXICO AND ELSEWHERE WHICH IS LARGELY IS DRIVEN BY REGULATIONS AND OTHER CHALLENGES. CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURAL LEADERSHIP IS A HERITAGE WORTH FIGHTING FOR. PART OF THE ANSWER LIES IN ONE EMBRACING NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL MAKE THE INDUSTRY MORE RESILIENT SUSTAINABLE PROFITABLE AND EQUITABLE INTO INVESTING IN OUR WORKFORCE THE PEOPLE WHO WILL INVENT OPERATE IN SEWER INDUSTRY IN A BETTER FUTURE. THE EMERGING AD TECH INDUSTRY HAS EXPERIENCED EXPLOSIVE GROWTH IN THE LAST TEN YEARS AS WAS MENTIONED IN THE INVESTMENT IS INCREASING FOR SOLUTIONS FOR SUSTAINABLE FARMING HEALTHY FOOD AND SUPPLY CHAIN RESILIENCE AMONG OTHER THINGS. THIS HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY BOTH BY LARGER FARMING FOOD INCUMBENTS BUT ALSO BY SILICON VALLEY INVESTORS AND TECHNOLOGISTS. AND MUCH OF MY AND OTHERS IN THIS ROOM TO WORK IS TO BRIDGE THE VERY LARGE BUSINESS AND CULTURAL GAPS. BETWEEN AGRICULTURE AND TECHNOLOGY. BUT THE WRITINGS ON THE WALL. INNOVATIONS SUCH AS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BIOLOGICAL ADVANCES OF SUCH AS CRISPR. IN CLOUD COMPUTING ARE DEMONSTRATING THAT AGTECH IS HERE TO STAY. AND WILL CONTINUE TO TRANSFORM THE WAY WE GROW UP AND AS WELL AS CONSUME FOOD. THAT MEANS CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL WORKFORCE MUSH MUST LOOK MUCH DIFFERENT IN THE COMING YEARS AND WE MUST PREPARE FOR THAT STARTING WITH TODAY'S PROFESSIONALS. AS WELL AS OUR COLLEGE LEVEL INVENTORS AND OPERATORS AND OUR YOUNG SCHOOL CHILDREN. IT'S A CHALLENGE TO ATTRACT YOUNG PEOPLE INTO THE AG INDUSTRY AS THEY IMAGINE OR HEAR STORIES FROM PARENTS ABOUT BACKBREAKING WORK AND LOW PAY. THE REALITY IS THERE ARE MANY HIGH PAYING REWARDING CAREERS IN AG INDUSTRY. AND AS THE FOOD AN ACTIVE SECTORS- BECOME MORE DIGITISED THERE WILL BE MANY MORE. THE NEED WE SEE IS THAT THAT WORKERS AT ALL LEVELS FROM EQUIPMENT OPERATORS TO GREENHOUSE TECHNICIANS TO IRRIGATION PEST MANAGEMENT SPECIALIST ALL NEED MORE CROSS DISCIPLINARY KNOWLEDGE. THEY NEED TO HAVE SKILLS THAT SPAN AGRICULTURE BIOLOGY COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING. WE NEED TO HAVE FARM EXPERTISE AND KNOW HOW TO USE ABSENT MACHINES AND EVENTUALLY ROBOTS. THESE DISCIPLINES ARE TRADITIONALLY ODD BEDFELLOWS AND I'VE SEEN FIRST HAND STRUGGLE IN ALIGNING THE WORLD'S OF AGON TACK TO CREATE NOVEL NEW CURRICULUM TO TRAIN AND PREPARE STUDENTS FOR THE FUTURE. LET ME GIVE A COUPLE EXAMPLES OF APPROACHES WERE TAKEN RIGHT NOW- UC DAVIS UC AGONISTS RESOURCES UC BERKELEY AND OTHERS HAVE CREATED A NEW ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR THE FOOD SYSTEM INSTITUTE. WHERE WE'RE DEVELOPING A LOT OF THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE PLACING UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CSU AND UC LEVELS. IN THE COMPANIES TO LEARN THIS TACK AND DO ALONGSIDE THEIR STUDIES WITH PAID OPPORTUNITIES NOT FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGES- LET HER KNOW WHO HER FROM IN A MINUTE. AND HIGH SCHOOLS TO HELP UPSKILL THEIR INSTRUCTORS IN A TRAIN THE TRAINER MODEL- TO LEARN THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND BRING THEM BACK INTO THEIR CLASSROOMS. OUR NEXT GENERATION OF UC COOPERATIVE EXTENSION PROFESSIONALS ARE CONDUCTING- AND HAVE FOR MANY YEARS FEEL DAYS FOR FARMERS AND AG WORKERS IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH. BUT ARE ALSO INCORPORATING NEW TECH READY OF NEW TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS THE LATEST SPRAY TECHNOLOGY OR MECHANICAL HARVESTING. SOMEONE MENTIONED I CREATED A NEW EXAMPLE AFTER THE MENTION ABOUT SMALL FARMS- AND A SMALL FARMS IS OBVIOUSLY A VERY. IMPORTANT COMPONENT IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO THERE'S A VARIETY OF NEW PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON LIKE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW FOOD HUB- IN- IN YOLO COUNTY AND FOOD HUBS ARE ARE POPPING UP AROUND THE STATE AS WELL. AS WELL AS A SMALL- FARM TECHNOLOGY LENDING LIBRARY IN THE FRESNO REGION- LET OUT OF OUR CURRENT FACILITY- NEAR PARLAY- IT'S PROGRAMS LIKE THAT THAT WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO HELP US SMALL FARMERS THERE'S A WILL THERE'S- A VARIETY OF OTHER EXAMPLES I COULD GIVE. THESE ARE IMPORTANT BUT ONLY A DROP IN THE BUCKET OF WHAT'S NEEDED TO TRANSFORM OUR FOOD NICK WORKFORCE. OPPORTUNITIES THERE NOT ONLY TO MAKE- TODAY'S AGRICULTURE ECONOMY MORE SUSTAINABLE AND PROFITABLE. BUT I BELIEVE THE NEXT GENERATION OF AGTECH CAN CAN COMPLETELY TRANSFORM CALIFORNIA'S RURAL ECONOMIES BIOBASED PRODUCTS AND MATERIALS THAT USED- WASTE AS INGREDIENTS LIKE STRAWBERRIES GROWN VERTICAL FARMS NEW FOODS LIKE ALTERNATIVE PROTEINS ARE ALL YOU KNOW DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE OF A BIG OPPORTUNITY FOR THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA'S ROLE ECONOMIES IN PARTICULAR IF WE CAN TAKE LEADERSHIP OF THE OPPORTUNITIES AND INVEST IN THE WORKFORCE. I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH COUPLE THOUGHTS ABOUT WHAT STILL NEEDED FOR CONSIDERATION THIS COMMITTEE'S WORK- TO HELP US GET READY TO GO. ONE NEED TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN EDUCATION ALL LEVELS GRADE SCHOOL THROUGH UNIVERSITY BY SUPPORTING THOSE PROGRAMS. THAT ARE WORKING AND ARE BRINGING NEW YOUNG PEOPLE TO THE MANY PATHWAYS INTO THE FOOD BANK SECTOR- MANY PROGRAMS TO GET STARTED TO GRANT FUNDING WOULD HAVE A HARD TIME SUSTAINING AND SCALING. BUT SECOND TRAIN NEXT GENERATION OF YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS AND FUSING THEM WITH THE SKILL SETS TO SOLVE CALIFORNIA'S BIGGEST CLIMATE AND FOOD SYSTEM. RESILIENCE TO CHALLENGE IT IS VERY IMPORTANT. I NEED TO FOCUS ON A RURAL COMMUNITIES SO THESE YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS CAN BUILD THESE GLOBALLY LEADING COMPANIES OF THE FUTURE THE GOOGLE FOR AG I'M FROM THE RURAL COMMUNITIES AND REVITALIZE OF THE COLONIES. LAST CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR AND THE FARMERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE AMONG THE BEST IN THE WORLD. OUR ABILITY TO FEED OUR STATE AND OUR NATION. NATIONAL SECURITY THROUGH FOOD SECURITY IS A WORTHY AND IMPORTANT GOAL. IN CALIFORNIA PRODUCES THE FOOD THAT WE SHOULD BE EATING MORE FRUITS VEGETABLES AND NUTS. WE NEED TO WORK FORCE TODAY. A WORKFORCE THAT DRIVE THE NEXT GENERATION OF FARMING FOOD PRODUCTION AND THE FUTURE BIOECONOMY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS AND DISCUSSION. AND HOSTING A FARM TOURS IN ANY OF YOUR DISTRICTS THANKS. ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. I'M JUST A QUICK QUESTION COULD YOU ELABORATE MORE ON THE SMALL FARM LENDING HOW THAT'S HOW THEY YEAH SO THAT PROBLEM IS- IS NOT GOTTEN OFF THE GROUND JUST YET WE'VE GOT WE HAVE A UC SMALL FARMS NETWORK WHICH HAS- SMALL FARMS ADVISORS THAT ARE LOCATED ACROSS THE STATE ONE IN PARTICULAR IN FRESNO COUNTY- RUTH DAHLQUIST WILLARD WHO WORKS WITH- SMALL FARMERS PARTICULARLY FARMERS OF COLOR- IN CREATING NEW PRODUCTS- SHE HAS REALLY SEEN THE NEED- FOR TRAINING SMALL FARMS ON THE USE OF WHAT YOU WOULD CALL APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGY COULD SCALE DOWN AND COST EFFECTIVE ENOUGH FOR SMALL FARMS TO USE. BUT THEY'RE STILL A BARRIER IN KNOWING WAT'S AVAILABLE HOW TO USE IT AND THEN ACQUIRING IT AND SO THE IDEA IS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON NOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO LIKELY FUNDS FOR SOME GRANT ENTERPRISE IS TO GET A COLLECTION OF THIS TECHNOLOGY THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY THEN WENT OUT TO FARMERS IN THE REGION- WE CAN TRAIN ON HOW TO USE IT. DON'T HAVE TODAY. THAT SOUNDS REALLY GREAT THANK YOU. THE OTHERS ON SCENE AND- I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU MISTER C. LIKE HOW EARLY SHOULD WE BEGIN TEACHING I MEAN I KNOW I'M SURE UNIVERSITIES ARE WORKING ON THIS BUT I'M TALKING AND IN THE- HOT WHAT'S THAT WOULD WELL EARLY AGE YOU KNOW- OUR BUYER DIVISION RUNS THE- ONES. H. FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO I THINK WE BELIEVE THAT SHOULD BEGIN VERY EARLY IN GRADE SCHOOL. AND I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR THINK SOME GREAT EXAMPLES OF NONTRADITIONAL EDUCATION THAT GETS KIDS INTO GET DICK LEARNING- SPACES- REALLY AT THE GRADE SCHOOL LEVEL I DON'T I THINK IT'S NOT EVER TOO EARLY TO START AND I THINK IF WE REALLY WANT TO GET KIDS INTERESTED IN TRAJECTORY TRULY IN. CAREERS OF THE FUTURE HE REALLY TO CAPTURE THEIR IMAGINATION AND GRADE SCHOOL SO I THINK TO ME GRADE SCHOOL IS THE PLACE TO BEGIN. AND THEN YOU KNOW ASSEMBLY WORK- THROUGH THROUGH- UNDERGRADUATE GRADUATE EDUCATION I UNDER PERCENT AGREE WITH YOU I MEAN WE DOES ORGANIZE- EVENTS WITH SCHOOLS THAT EARLY AGE IN THE- IT'S FUN TO WATCH THE KIDS REALIZE THAT YOU KNOW EVERYTHING THEY'RE TOUCHING EVERYTHING THAT THEY'RE EATING IS LITERALLY. YOU KNOW COMING FROM A FARM AND THEY'VE THEY'RE FASCINATED RIGHT BUT THE FAST THE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HERE IN SCHOOLS RIGHT AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE OF. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PARTICULAR HIGH TECH EITHER IT REALLY JUST BE EX YOU KNOW THEM EXPERIENCING- FARM AND WHERE THEIR FOOD COMES FROM IN A VERY VERY SIMPLE WAY TO CAPTURE THAT IMAGE AND IMAGINATION FROM EARLY AGE WE DO THAT A NUMBER OF ARE YOU SEE LOCATIONS BOTH ON CAMPUS. AND AROUND THE STATE CALIFORNIA AND WE PUT IT OUT WE OBVIOUSLY WANT TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT AND SCALE THAT UP BECAUSE. THAT EARLY LEARNING IS JUST SO IMPORTANT. WHILE WORKING. TO MANY MORE MORE DISCUSSION WITH YOU ON THE RIGHT THANK YOU ALL THANK YOU SIR. NEXT WE HAVE DENNIS DONOHUE DIRECTOR AT THE CENTRAL THE CENTER OF INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY AT WESTERN GROWERS ASSOCIATION. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT THANKS VERY MUCH FOR THE INVITATION TO- VISIT WITH YOU THIS MORNING THAT IT'S- HARD NOT TO THINK ABOUT THE REMARKS I HAD IN MIND AND THEN TRY AND THINK ON YOUR FEET TO A RESPOND TO SOME OF THINGS IS THAT SO WELL. YEAH YEAH. WELL ALL OF I'LL TRY TO DO IT THEN THE- AND THEN BEEN UP BY DAVE HAD A TO SOME- FRIEDMAN IN SALT I'M GONNA I'M GONNA IMPROVISE A LITTLE BIT BUT THE FIRST THING I WANTED TO BESIDES THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO BE HERE- IS ALSO THANK SECRETARY ROSS WHO IS- MY PARTNER IN CRIME SO TO SPEAK FOR A YEAR AND I WANT AND I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT THAT PROGRAM BUT I BUT I WANT TO CALL ATTENTION TO- THE SECOND PAGE OF. FOR OUR LETTER TO YOU AND SHE TALKS VERY MUCH ABOUT. TECHNOLOGY BEING. THE BRIDGE. TO THE FUTURE M. AND WE CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THAT AND WE AND WE APPRECIATE- FOR CALLING ATTENTION TO SOME OF THE THINGS WE'RE TRYING TO DO AS A- AS WELL AS WESTERN GROWERS I DO RUN WESTERN GROWERS CENTER FOR INNOVATION AND- AND TECHNOLOGY. I'M THE PROVERBIAL SALES BEEN MARRIED TO A FARMER'S DAUGHTER SO I WAS IN THE DEAL AS WE LIKE TO SAY IN SALINAS FOR THIRTY YEARS- AND I BELONG TO ALL OF THE GROUPS WHETHER IT'S PMA UNITED OR WESTERN GROWERS. AND WESTERN GROWERS IT'S SOMETHING I THINK PARTICULARLY IN THE COMPLEX REPORT ABOUT FIVE OR SIX YEARS AGO. WHERE WHERE THEY SAID. THEY SAID WE NEED TO JUMP INTO THE INNOVATION. AND TECHNOLOGY AND BE PROACTIVE IN RATHER THAN. REACTIVE TO THE FUTURE. AND WHEN YOU WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT AG TECH AND THAT'S WHAT THAT'S REALLY ABOUT THAT PHRASE- YEAH CAN BE RENEWABLES% THAT CAN BE ROBOTICS THAT COULD BE SOFTWARE SERVICE. SO IT'S REAL IT'S REALLY KIND OF A KIND OF A CATCH ALL- AND WE- I MAKE NO DOUBT- EVEN THOUGH YOU VISIT ALL THOSE FORMS WE DO COMPETE A LITTLE BIT AMONGST OURSELVES BUT WE DO COOPERATE PRETTY WELL ON. TECHNICAL ISSUES REGULATORY ISSUES AND FOOD SAFETY ISSUES AMONG WE RECOGNIZE. WHEN IT CAME TO TECHNOLOGY- AND THEN. THAT THAT'S- COOPERATE. WERE ALSO BORN GOING TO MATTER. AND I APPRECIATED YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT SAN DIEGO COUNTY AND IT MAY BE A LITTLE COUNTER INTUITIVE BUT YOU KNOW WESTERN GROWERS- OUR MEMBERSHIP REPRESENTS YOU KNOW THE FIGURES YOU LAID OUT. ON AVERAGE TO DEPEND UPON THE CROP SOME 5260% OF NORTH AMERICA'S FRESH FRUIT AND VEGETABLE AND THAT PRODUCTION AND- NEARLY HALF OF THE ORGANIC PRODUCTION OF THOSE CATEGORIES. AS WELL. AND WE'RE OPERATING IN SOME THIRTY TWO STATES IN THIRTY COUNTRIES TO GET THAT DONE BECAUSE THE MARKET PLACE EXPECTS US TO BE IN ON A- YEAR ROUND BASIS SO WE'RE THE SPECIALTY CROP CROWD. IT'S A GLOBAL PLATFORM- IT MAY BE A LITTLE COUNTER INTUITIVE BUT- THERE'S- EVERYTHING YOU JUST. LAID OUT ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S TRUE THIS IS THE PLACE TO BE- WE HAVE ENORMOUS ADVANTAGES BUT BECAUSE- AND I'M SPEAKING AS THE SPECIALTY CROP CROWD. A LOT OF THE THINGS WE NEED TO GET DONE. BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY CROPS. AND SO MUCH DIVERSITY WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE SCALE WE NEED TO GET CERTAIN THINGS DONE UNLESS WE WORK TOGETHER. SO I MAY BE A LITTLE COUNTER INTUITIVE BUT ONE OF THE WAYS TO HELP THE SMALLER FARMERS PROTECT WE WANT TO COME TO THE TECHNOLOGY. IS THAT THAT THE LARGER PLAYERS. ARE GOOD AT GOOD PLACE OF AGGREGATION TO GET SOME TECHNOLOGY DON AND CREATE SCALE AND BATTLE WITH. THAT- THAT WORKS ON BEHALF OF EVERYBODY SO FOR INSTANCE- I DON'T AT. CAN MENTIONED OUR GLOBAL HARVEST AUTOMATION. INITIATIVE ONE OF THE THINGS WE FOUND OUT AS WE LOOKED AT. THE LABOR ISSUE. AT AS IT IS THAT. WE WERE DOING PRETTY IN CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS SPENDING ON WHEAT IN THE MARKET PLACE WAS WORKING AS I LIKE TO TELL PEOPLE. THANK R. TWO D. TWO. REPETITIVE MOVIE MOVING UP AND DOWN FIELDS. BUT WHEN YOU START THINKING ABOUT HARVEST CP THREE OUT I TALKING ABOUT REPLICATED EGGMAN BIT. DIFFERENT CONVERSATION MUCH HIGHER LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY. AND DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE SCALE. CROP BY CROP. FOR A CUSTOM AUTOMATION. SOLUTION SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE SAID WAS WELL LET'S LOOK AT SOME CALIFORNIA ON AN AGGREGATE BASIS SO CROPS THAT WE GROW HERE AND SAID OKAY. ON AVERAGE WE ON A GLOBAL. SCALE WE REPRESENT LET'S SAY 50% OF THE MARKET GIVE OR TAKE SO THAT MEANS WE REPRESENT SCALE. SO PROOF OF CONCEPT HAS TO HAPPEN HERE SO CALIFORNIA HAS THAT OPPORTUNITY TO BE THE GLOBAL LANDING SPOT. FOR A LOT OF TECHNOLOGY WE THINK THAT'S A HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA. FOR OUR INDUSTRY FOR RURAL RURAL ECONOMIES AND SO WE AGGREGATED. AND WHAT WE BASICALLY DID WAS WE LOOKED AT- SPECIALLY CRAFTED SAID THREE THINGS ARE HAPPENING YOU'RE GETTING THINGS OFF THE GROUND OUT OF A TREE A CLIP FROM A BY. NOW HOW DO YOU GET THAT DONE SO FOR INSTANCE ONE OF OUR- AND JUST PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S- FOOD FOR THOUGHT A LITTLE BIT FOR ALL OF US. ONE OF OUR FAVORITE BRADLEY GROWER SHIPPERS WE HAD AMAJOR JAPANESE CORPORATION ROBOTICS PLAYER IN THE FIELD. THIS COMPANY REPRESENTED 25% OF THE U. S. BROCCOLI FLORETS FOODSERVICE MARKET OPPORTUNITY AND I LOOK AT THE GIRL AND I SAID NOW TELL TELL THEM HOW MANY YOU'RE GOING TO BUY AND I THOUGHT THE ANSWER WAS GOING TO BE BIGGER. AND HE SAID TO. FIVE SO WHAT'S GREAT THE ADDRESSABLE MARKET IS TEN. TRUST ME WHEN I TELL YOU. DOWN THERE AND MAKE INTO. SO NOW BUT- THAT'S ALSO OUR OPPORTUNITY. BECAUSE WE BECAUSE TO WILL GET MAY. THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU MARRY. SMALL NUMBERS WITH SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGY BUT THAT BECOMES OUR OPPORTUNITY. AND IF AND YOU KNOW SO WE THANK AND WE APPRECIATE CAN POINTING THIS UT THAT IF WE CAN STEP IN AS INDUSTRY. AND PROVIDE CLEAR DIRECTION OF HERE'S WHAT WE NEED THAT'S HELPFUL. AND THAT ACCELERATES ACCELERATES THE PROCESS SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THE GLOBAL HARVEST AUTOMATION INITIATIVE IS TRYING TO DO. I RUN WESTERN GROWERS INNOVATION CENTER AND ORIGINALLY STARTED WITH A PRETTY SIMPLE IDEA LET'S GET TECHNOLOGY TOGETHER WITH GROWERS AND- STUFF WILL HAPPEN REAL FAST RON. MUCH MUCH SLOWER PROCESS TAKES A LITTLE LONGER. THAN WE DAHLE PREFERRED SO WE REALIZED WE NEEDED TO START WORK MORE STRATEGICALLY. AND INTENTIONALLY. AND IN THAT PROCESS IT BECAME VERY VERY CLEAR. THAT THE FOLKS. TO THE COMMENTS YOU MADE ABOUT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ONE DAY JUST TALKED ABOUT THIS ISSUE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. NEEDED TO BE ADDRESSED SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. AND WE NEEDED TO BE INTENTIONAL AND WE NEED TO SEE IF WE COULD ACCELERATE THAT SO PART OF WHAT WE DO. AT WESTERN GROWERS AND THROUGH INNOVATION CENTERS WE DO SOME PROGRAMMING AND SO- KAREN AND I- WE'RE DOING AN EVENT TOGETHER APART NOW. AND I I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S I ALSO ON THE FORMER MAYOR OF SALINAS AGTECH WAS MY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU READ THE TWO STICKS TOGETHER THE SALINAS FRANCES VALLEY ON THE PLANET THE INNOVATORS MOST INNOVATIVE VALUE TO THE PLANET. WHAT A GAP. M. AS I LEFT OFFICE SINCE CONTINUE TO MY CAREER. I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH A YOUNG MAN WHO DOES ALL THE INNOVATION WORK FOR HIS FAMILY'S COMPANY AND HE SAID I WAS TELLING MY DAD EVERYONE I DEAL WITH. IS EITHER AG. FOR TACK HOW DO WE GET IT. IT'S ALMOST LIKE WE NEED A NEW KIND OF WORKER. THAT SHARED THAT WITH KAREN. AND THAT WITH THEM WHAT WAS REALLY KIND OF BORN OUT OF THAT IS. CAN WHY DON'T WE- TAKE A YEAR FOCUS. AND MOVE THROUGHOUT THE STATE USING COMMUNITY COLLEGES AS THE PLATFORM AN APP FOR CONVERSATIONS AND WE CHOSE COMMUNITY COLLEGES FOR A REASON BECAUSE WE THINK THEY'RE THE PERFECT INTERSECTION. FOR ALL STUDENTS COMING. COMING UP THE CHAIN THEY'RE ALSO IN THE UP SKILLING BUSINESS OF PROVIDING CERTIFICATES THEY'RE A PERFECT SPOT TO GO DIRECTLY AND ASK IF YOU WANT FOR ON TWO WAY FOR YOUR SCHOOL AND THEN AND THEN OF COURSE THEY HAVE CLEAR LINE OF SIGHT LIVES GAVE SAID FOUR H. FFA IS AND THAT SORT OF THING SO WE THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE. THE PERFECT. VEHICLE TO DO SO WE LAUNCHED. AND I PROVIDED THIS WITH YOU IN A KIND OF A PITCH SOMETIMES. A PICTURE SAYS THIS BETTER BETTER THAN I COULD SO WE- CHOSE FOR SCHOOLS. WE STARTED. AUGUST TWENTIETH SIX BEEN REGALLY AT REEDLEY COLLEGE. WILL BE DOWN IN IMPERIAL VALLEY COLLEGE AND THE END OF JANUARY BACK APARTMENT ALL. IN THE MIDDLE OF APRIL AND THEN WE CLOSE IN A VERY EXCITED ABOUT CLOSING HERE PARTICULARLY OF YOUR ALL'S INTEREST. IN THIS AT WOODLAND COMMUNITY COLLEGE JUNE ONE AND TWO. AND THE IDEA IS TO. MOVE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. HAVE THIS VERY CONVERSATION. AT IT AND IF YOU LOOK ON THE BACK PAGE THE FORMAT IS BASED BASICALLY THE SAME WE'RE GONNA BRING IN INDUSTRY. AND THEY'RE GOING TO SAY. THIS IS WHAT WE NEED LOUDLY AND CLEARLY. THAT WE'RE GONNA BRING IN EDUCATION WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. AND SAY THIS IS WHAT WE'RE DOING OR INTENDED TO- AND THE IDEAS YOU KNOW THE REGIONAL COLLEGE. IS THE HOST BUT WE HAVE TO WE BRING IN THE OTHER PLAYERS CELESTIALS WAS THERE- UC MERCED CAME DOWN THAT THAT TYPE OF THING- POM WONDERFUL HAS A CHARTER SCHOOL SO THE IDEA IS TO REPRESENT. THE YEAH YOU KNOW THE WHOLE AREA WHO'S DOING WHAT AND SO WE'LL MOVE THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO DO THAT AND THEN WE HAVE A CEO PANEL WHICH IS IMPORTANT. TO SAVE ON BEHALF OF INDUSTRY LEADERSHIP. AND THE SPEECH NEEDS TO BE GIVEN TO OURSELVES SOMETIMES IS INDUSTRY THIS IS IMPORTANT. THIS NEEDS TO HAPPEN. AND WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF IT. AND THEN AND THEN KAREN AND I'VE CAN FINISH UP WITH A WITH A CONVERSATION. AND THESE ARE THESE ARE TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCLES AND THEN THE NEXT MORNING WE WILL. SPEND TIME WITH GENERALLY STUDENTS BECAUSE WE WANT TO WE WANT YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE EXCITED ABOUT AG. BUT IT'S A MUCH DEEPER. THAT THE PROPERTIES ARE BROADER DEEPER MORE ROBUST THAN THEY OFTEN OFTEN REALIZE SO- AND- THE IDEA WILL BE. WHAT OF WHICH ONE WE GET BACK HERE TO WOODLAND WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED AND WHERE THE GAPS WHAT DID WE LEARN AND READ LIKE SO YOU'VE ALREADY ASKED THE QUESTION HOW SOON DO WE START SO ONE OF THE- SCHOOLS WE HAD UP THERE WAS THE MCFARLAND DISTRICT AND IF YOU LIKE- KEVIN COSTNER TRACK. GUESS WHAT ONE OF HIS LEVY THIS WAS THEY HAVE A GREAT ROBOTICS PROGRAM AND SO THE SUPERINTENDENT TOOK US THROUGH AND KAREN HAVE THIS FOR THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL THE MIDDLE SCHOOL BY HIGH SCHOOL THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL HAS THREE MAKERSPACES. SO YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF YOUNG. CHILDREN WHO WERE EXCITED MAKING THINGS AND ALREADY GETTING THAT STEM BASED EDUCATION SO WHAT DID WE LEARN START AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BUT ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS WE'RE LEARNING IS THERE'S GOING TO BE A TEACHER GAP. WHO'S GONNA TEACH THIS STUFF. BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE A LOT OF TERRIFIC. TEACHERS BUT THEY ARE YOU KNOW YOU MENTIONED IRRIGATION THEY MAY HAVE A BACKGROUND IN YOUR NATION THAT THAT THAT DOES NOT NECESSARILY GETS READY TO GO TO TALK TO TALK ABOUT ROBOTICS AND AI BUT BUT WE ALSO SO RELAY FOR INSTANCE IS BRINGING IN INDUSTRY PEOPLE THEY FACILITATE THE CONVERSATION. TO START THE PROCESS BUT THIS ISSUE OF TEACHING. JOB SHADOWING. IT'S GOING TO BE AN ISSUE SO WHAT WE TRY TO DO IS FIGURE OUT WHERE THE ISSUE IS ONE OF THE GAPS WHAT ARE. WHAT ARE THE WHAT'S THE ACTUAL BANDWIDTH BECAUSE BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A WORLD. OF SCALE- AS YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE BOB SO. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE WE GONNA NEED AND HOW WE THINK HOW DO WE FIGURE THIS OUT SO THOSE ARE A COUPLE OF. TAKEAWAYS AND THEN THE OTHER THING I THINK YOU SHOULD. WILL BE BE. EXCITED ABOUT IT THEN I GOT A FEW PHONE CALLS AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE HEY HOW COME YOU DIDN'T BITE ME AND- YOU KNOW SO I MEAN I. AM A FORMER MAYOR I KNOW HOW TO DO IT A LOT WELL YOU KNOW. THAT YOU CAN GET THE EVERYONE BUT- WE HEARD FROM SUCH A SMALL COMMUNITY. IN SANGER. THAT A GROUP OF PARENTS. AND THE SCHOOL. GRAMMAR IN A GRAMMAR SCHOOL DISTRICT. THEY WANT TO BUILD A CASE THROUGH AGE. DEDICATED GRAMMAR SCHOOL THAT IS SOLELY BASED ON ITS OWN IT'S ALMOST LIKE A LAND GRANT UNIVERSITY WE'RE WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE EQUIVALENT OF A AG AT. GRAMMAR SCHOOL METAL BE FOUNDATIONAL THAT WAS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE IN PRETTY EXCITING. YOU KNOW THAT THE PRINCIPLE- YOU KNOW I COULD PUT HIM ON A SUNDAY MORNING WITH ANY OF ANALYST PRETTY GOOD. OFF START THE KIDS YOUNG SO THOSE WERE THINGS WERE LEARNING AND FIND IT OUT SO IT'S VERY EXCITING TO MOVE THROUGH THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND- AND WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO REALLY BRING IT BACK. THAT KIND OF THAT COMPOSITE. PICTURE TO YOU ALL. BY THE TIME WE GET TO A- GET GET THE WOODLAND. SO THAT'S THE NATURE OF THE PROGRAM. WE ASKED THAT SAME QUESTION. YOU ASKED SEVERAL MONTHS AGO AND SAID HOW DO WE GET THAT KIND OF WORKERS BECAUSE OF BECAUSE WE KNOW WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT AND THE OTHER THING THAT TIPPED ME OFF WAS WE STARTED TO GET A LOT OF YOUR- ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITY. AND THEY SAID WE CAN'T FIND SALES PEOPLE. OKAY SO I CAN MAKE STUFF. BUT IF I CAN'T GET IT SOLD GET IT SERVICE SO SEVENTY SO WE AND SO IT'S NOT JUST A QUESTION OF. TECHNOLOGY IN A VACUUM YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE THE STUFF THAT GOES WITH IT. AND LET ME JUST CLOSE WITH THAT SINCE I LISTEN TO SOME OF YOUR COMMENTS I AM A FORMER MAYOR AND- MY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY. CONSISTS SALINAS IS A RELATIVELY AT THE TIME. JUST BECAUSE OUR STRUCTURAL BORDERS. WAS A RELATIVELY POOR CITY. IN TERMS OF- OUR OUR GENERAL FUND DOLLARS SO MY THOUGHT WAS OK HOW IF I HANG OUT UP NORTH AND IT WAS A CITY AVERAGE AGE OF TWENTY SIX. YEARS OLD HOW DO WE CREATE. OPPORTUNE THE OPPORTUNE. TO BRING AG TACK. AND MAINTAIN THE HEALTH OF THE WORLD ECONOMY IS. IT IS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE. AND WHERE YOU HAVE A HEALTHY AG COMMUNITY. AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THE TRANSITIONS WERE GOING THROUGH WHETHER EXACT. THERE TENDS TO BE EDUCATION THERE TENDS TO BE HEALTHCARE. SO THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT TIME LINE UP WHEN AG IS HEALTHY. AND I AND I THINK WE HAVE SOME HUGE OPPORTUNITIES FOR. CUSTOM MANUFACTURING. AND THEN I WOULD JUST SHARE AND I THINK GAVE MADE A TERRIFIC POINT I THINK PEOPLE SOMETIMES EXPECT TO FIND IN THESE. IN THIS COMMUNITY IN MONTANA AND- MY DIRECT EXPERIENCE IS THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHOSE FAMILY HAS FARMED WORKED IN THE FIELDS. HAVE THAT HAVE A MARVELOUS INTO IT SOUNDS. FOR AGRICULTURE. AND THE TRICK IS GETTING CITED ABOUT A FUTURE NAG AS OPPOSED TO WHAT I WANT TO DO WITH MY FOLKS AND- GUESS WHAT THE FOLKS PROBABLY DON'T WANT YOU TO DO IT EITHER. YEAH BUT THEY BUT THAT THE BLACK. THERE IS. SOMETHING TO BE GOING FROM THAT EXPERIENCE THAT THEY ALL HAD. AND IF WE CAN BUILD UPON THAT COMMUNITY BY COMMUNITY I WAS A STATE. IT'S A HUGE HUGE OPPORTUNITY TO MAINTAIN A REVITALIZED STUFF. OUR RURAL COMMUNITY ITSELF. I WAS. I'LL JUST. CLOSE WITH A YOU KNOW- YOU KNOW AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE I WOULD I WAS A GROWER RIGHT. I'VE I WAS KIND OF SHARING INSIDE A LITTLE BIT WHEN I HEARD ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOPER SPEAKING. BUT YET I COULDN'T HELP MYSELF IT WAS. INSIDE A DENTURE OUT LOUD. YEAH THE YOU YOU WILL HEAR FOR. OF COURSE WHERE THEY SHOULD BE TARGETED YOU'LL GET. A LOT OF GOOD ADVICE BUT IF I WERE TO GIVE ANY ADVICE. AND I DON'T GET PAID TO THANK ON BEHALF OF WESTERN GROWERS I JUST DO ANIMATION. IT WOULD BE LISTEN TO THE GROWERS. BECAUSE I WILL TELL YOU THE PEOPLE I'VE DEALT WITH IN TERMS OF THE COMMUNITY AS FELLOW INDUSTRY FOLKS. THERE I'M A BIG FAN OF THE SAINT OF GEORGE WASHINGTON CARVER THE CHALLENGE IS TO DO THE COMMON THINGS. UNCOMMONLY WELL NOW YOU'RE GONNA HEAR FROM DON CAMERON LATER TRUST ME WHEN I TELL YOU HE DOES THE COMMON THING. UNCOMMONLY WELL WHEN IT COMES TO MAKE THINGS BUT ALSO THESE ARE TERRIFIC BUSINESSPEOPLE AND IT IS IN THEIR DNA. TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. AND IF YOU LISTEN TO THEM AND MAKE THEM PART OF THE PROCESS AND NOT NECESSARILY GET AHEAD OF OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND YOU'D BE I THINK YOU'D BE AMAZED- AND I THINK ASSEMBLYMEMBER RUBIO YOUR COMMENTS IF WE WORK TOGETHER. YOU'D BE YOU'D BE AMAZED WHAT COULD HAPPEN BUT YEAH IT WOULD BE A SHAME FOR CALIFORNIA TO GIVE AWAY ITS PLACE ON THE PLAYING FIELD- FOR REASONS OF WE WEREN'T WE WEREN'T WORKING RATHER THAN HAVING SAID THAT WE REALLY DO HAVE TO DO THE HARD WORK OF DEVELOPING A SKILLED WORKFORCE AND I APPRECIATE THE TIME AND- THANK YOU SIR WELL SAID IN THE COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. I SEE NINE. A SYRUP. IT WAS WELL SET UP IT WAS WELL SAID- AND I KNOW YOU MENTIONED. THE FACT OF THE FOUR YEAR. GOING ON TO A FOUR YEAR BUT IS THERE ARE TALKS ABOUT. THE VOCATIONAL TRAINING AT AN EARLY AGE I MEAN. WE HEARD- K. THROUGH TWELVE BUT THE I'M TALKING LIKE I'M TALKING LIKE THAT THE SENIORS FOLKS THAT I'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT WE'VE WE CHANGE CAREER SO MANY TIMES RIGHT I MEAN I WOULD EXPECTED ME TO BE HERE RIGHT WELL I MEAN THAT NEVER DID I EXPECT YEAH. RIGHT CHANGE CAREERS. CAREERS ARE BEING CHANGED STUDENTS NOWADAYS ARE NEVER WHO EVER THOUGHT OF GOING INTO THE ACT. BUT THEY WILL THINK ABOUT TECH RIGHTRIGHT SO I'M THINKING HOW HOW DO WE HOW DO WE ENGAGE THAT ON A VOCATIONAL LEVEL. THAT'S ONE QUESTION SHELDON. YOU MENTIONED EARLIER TO YOU KNOW WHAT STATE WHAT'S WHAT CAN THE STATE. DO TO TARGET THE FUNDING WELL I THINK I THINK THE STATE IS ALREADY DOING A LOT OF TRIPS TERRIFIC THINGS FOR INSTANCE I HAD A CHANCE TO VISIT WITH KAREN YESTERDAY AND I KNOW I KNOW THEY'RE STARTING TO BE DOLLARS AVAILABLE SPECIFICALLY FOR FARMWORKERS I THINK THAT'S- TERRIFIC- I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY QUESTION YOU ALL. WILL GET GREAT- ADVICE AND RECOMMENDATIONS WERE TO TARGET. EDUCATE EDUCATIONAL DOLLARS BUT BUT I WOULD TAKE VERY VERY SERIOUSLY. HOW DO WE START- YANG BUT TO YOUR POINT. OUR CURRENT WORK FORCE- AND UPSKILLING A WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND LABOUR DOLLARS AN APPRENTICESHIP OPPORTUNITIES. WE NEED TO BE ALL OVER THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO EXPAND THE PRODUCTIVE LIVES OF OUR CURRENT WORKFORCE WHERE WHERE WHERE WE CAN'T AND THESE TYPES OF JOBS ALSO WILL LEAD TO WORKING CONDITIONS AND HIGHER WAGES. AS AS WELL BUT YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT WE'RE ON IT WE'RE ON KIND OF A LIFELONG. JR LEARNING TRACK THAT I MEAN I SUSPECT AT SOME LEVEL WE'RE ALL WAKING UP AND I UNDERSTAND AND I'M NOT THAT'S WHY THESE RURAL pCOLLEGES ARE PRETTY. ARE REALLY REALLY CRITICAL BECAUSE IT THEY ARE THE PLACE YOU CAN MAKE THE CONNECTION THAT YOU KNOW IS BROADBAND COMES INTO PLAY HERE. PEOPLE HAVE GOT MORE USED OF WORKING ONLINE. AND YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE SAN JOAQUIN- ABOUT YOU KNOW AND I MEAN I BEGAN TO APPRECIATE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE AS A MAYOR BECAUSE YOU CAN ALWAYS HEAR TWENTY EIGHT CITIES AND HOW DOES THAT WORK AND THEN WHEN YOU GET OVERSIGHT SPENDING TIME AND SEE. HOW THAT REGION FUNCTIONS BUT YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE WORKING AND RELATE. YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT YOU MIGHT GO HOME. HELLO MORE SOMEWHERE ELSE YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GO BACK TO THAT SOMEWHERE. WHAT AT NIGHT IF RIDLEY HAPPEN YOU CAN DO IT ONLINE SO I THINK THIS ISSUE OF ACCESSIBILITY. IN TERMS OF EDUCATION LIFELONG LEARNING AND A REAL REAL FOCUS ON CURRENT WORK FORCE. IS IMPORTANT I BUT I ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE. YOU KNOW WITH WITH BROADLY KNOW WHAT TO DO THE ISSUE BECOMES ARE WE DOING IT ON SCALE ON A SUSTAINABLE BASIS. REALLY YOU KNOW IT'S THE SO IT'S STRUCTURE SCALE. SUSTAINABILITY SPILLED AT THE SENSIBILITY OF NUMBERS ENOUGH. I'LL GIVE YOU A VERY SIMPLE EXAMPLE WHEN I WAS THE MAYOR. WE HAD- YEAH WE HAD SOME YOUTH VIOLENCE CHALLENGES IN THE CITY AND WE WANT TO THE BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB AND THEY WERE GOING TO GO INTO A DIFFERENT ZIP CODE. AND THEY COULD SERVICE FOUR HUNDRED. CATS OF LIKE WHAT'S GREAT I GOT SIX THOUSAND TEENAGERS IN THAT ZIP CODE. THE SERVICE FOUR HUNDRED WE KNEW WHAT TO DO. BUT IT WASN'T SUFFICIENT. SCALE ON BANDWIDTH SO I'M I'M KIND OF A- I MEAN I'M REALLY BULLISH ON THIS IDEA OF. NOT JUST STRATEGY GET NUMBERS AROUND. AND YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE CAPACITY WHAT'S THE DEMAND THEM AND UNDERSTAND THAT BUT BUT I THINK YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT. WORKFORCE EXTENDING A PRODUCTIVE LIFE GET UP I THINK. YOU'VE GOT THE PROGRAMS IN PLACE THINGS LIKE APPRENTICESHIPS BUT I'LL TELL YOU THE ONE THING I WOULD REALLY TAKE VERY VERY SERIOUSLY THERE'S GONNA BE A TEACHER ISSUE THE STUFF AND I GREW TO AND THAT AND THAT I THINK THAT'S GOT TO BE ADDRESSED AND YEAH THAT IS NO REFLECTION ON THE TEACHING RECORD IN PLACE IT'S JUST. THE JOBS OF TOMORROW OR THE JOBS OF TOMORROW. HE ALSO HAS A LIVES ARE GONNA REQUIRE NEW SKILLS AS ANY I DON'T HAVE GOOD TASTE FOCUS ON RETRAINING FOR EXAMPLE ALSO ARE ALREADY IN THE CAREER YEAH. IN THE MID CAREER RIGHT YEAH AND FRANKLY I THINK A LOT OF TEACHERS WOULD BE EXCITED TO DO SOMETHING NEW. YOU KNOW SO IT THAT IF SAME PER. COULD APPLY THERE. YOU KNOW YOU KNOW IT'S HELPFUL. TO GET FOLKS WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE TERRAIN. THEN CAN WE GET THEM EXCITED ABOUT THE WEATHER TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES OR WHAT WE NEED TO DO BUT IT DOES TEACHING THING. IS REALLY A BIG BIG DEAL AND IF I HAD TO. IMPRESS AT THE SOMETHING UPON THE AUDIT THAT BE SOMETHING I WOULD. ONE OF THEM. SENIOR ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU MAYOR OKAY YOU BET RIGHT. NEXT WE HAVE- MICHAEL MILLER DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF WINE GRAPE GROWERS. THIRTY YOU'RE DOING. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS WOULD YOU PREFER THAT I TOOK MY MASCOT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND MAYOR. DOES IT MATTER TO YOU. OKAY UP SEVEN A GOOD MORNING MEMBERS- TAKE A CHAIR- MEMBERS AND STAFF STAFF CAN BE THIS IMPORTANT HEARING HI MY NAME IS MICHAEL MILLER WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF BUYING GROUP GROWERS- AND WE'LL TALK TODAY SPECIFICALLY ABOUT TECHNOLOGY. AND ONE COMMODITY THAT IS WINE GRAPES- IN ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT WE FACE AND- WE BEGIN WHICH IS GIVING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR INDUSTRY OTHERS MORE THAN SIX A SIX THOUSAND MARGARET GROWERS PRODUCE MORE THAN A HUNDRED TEN VARIETIES CALIFORNIA'S ABA'S. MIKE GIPSON WROTE ON SIX SEVEN EIGHT ACRES IN FORTY NINE OF FIFTY CALIFORNIA COUNTIES WE BELIEVE ALMOST ALL OF YOUR COUNTIES HAVE MY GRAPES. ABOUT SIX AN EIGHTY FIVE MILLION GALLONS. OF WINE TO PRODUCE A CALIFORNIA ANNUALLY. CALIFORNIA PRODUCES AS EIGHTY FIVE. OF ALL U. S. WHY IN CALIFORNIA'S WINE IN MY GROUP SECTOR EMPLOYS THREE ARE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS. THE PACE SEVENTY POINT TWO BILLION IN WAGES ANNUALLY IF A SEVEN POINT SIX BILLION IN TAXES AND GENEROUS EVERY WEAPON TWO BILLION AND ANNUAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY WHAT TRACK THE ONE TWENTY THREE BILLION TOURIST EVERY YEAR IN CALIFORNIA. U. S. WINE EXPORTS REACHED ONE POINT FOUR SIX BILLION IN VALUE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND 95% OF U. S. EXPORT OF WINE COMES FROM THE GOLDEN STATE CALIFORNIA. THIS IS SAY CALPERS ICONIC WINE INDUSTRY IS PROUD OF OUR RICH HERITAGE. AND A CONTRIBUTIONS THIS AMAZING STATE AND OUR NATION. WITH THAT IN MIND THIS MORNING I'LL DISCUSS TWO ISSUES RELATIVE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF TECHNOLOGY. IN CALIFORNIA'S WINE INDUSTRY. FIRST ALL DISCUSSED THE NEED TO SHIFT TO MORE AUTOMATION AND MECHANISATION IN VINEYARD MANAGEMENT. AND THEY'LL DISCUSS THE CHALLENGES AROUND MAKING THAT SHIFT. FIRST TO UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO SHIFT TO AUTOMATION AND MCAT AND MECHANIZATION NEED TO CAREFULLY LOOK AT OUR EXISTING WORKFORCE CHALLENGES. THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION THAT CALIFORNIA'S VINEYARDS WORKFORCE IS SHRINKING. AND ANNUAL SURVEY VIDEO OWNERS 54% WAS A LABOR SHORTAGE AND COST IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES TWENTY TWENTY. AND TWENTY NINETEEN LABOR SHORTAGE ACROSS WERE NUMBER ONE OVERALL CONCERN FOR WHITE GRAPE GROWERS. THERE'S SEVERAL REASONS FOR THAT CONCERN BUT I WANT TO BE CLEAR THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE OF A SHORTAGE OF GOOD PAYING JOBS. ANY ASSERTION OF THAT FAILS TO RECOGNIZE DATA AND FACTS. FOR EXAMPLE SOME NORTH COAST BEEN YEARS THIS YEAR PAID AS MUCH AS THIRTY DOLLARS PER HOUR DURING HARVEST. AND THEY STILL CANNOT FIND ENOUGH PEOPLE TO DO THE WORK. THAT'S THE PUBLIC TO SIXTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS AN ANNUAL SALARY. ADDITIONALLY COMPETITION FOR LABOR FROM OTHER INDUSTRIES IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE. MANY PEOPLE JUST DON'T WANT TO WORK IN AGRICULTURE ANYMORE MANY AG WORKERS CAN FIND EMPLOYMENT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES WHERE THE WORK IS LESS DEMANDING. PHYSICALLY DEMANDING WE CAN ALSO SEE A SHORTAGE WE ALSO SEASHORES A SEASONAL LABOR DUE TO FEDERAL IMMIGRATION POLICIES AND THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE H. TWO A. GUEST ADVOCATE PROGRAM. FOR MOST OF OUR GROWERS THAT PROGRAM IS TOO EXPENSIVE AND IT'S A BIT CANNOT AFFORD IT'S JUST NOT REALISTIC. BUT FOR THOSE BUT FOR THOSE GROCERY CAPITA TO PAY. THOSE EMPLOYERS PROVIDE FREE TRANSPORTATION FREE HOUSING COMPARED OF BENEFITS AND WAGES. AND DO ALL THAT TO ATTRACT EMPLOYEES ANOTHER CHALLENGE FOR EMPLOYEES OF THE VINEYARDS ARE OFTEN GEOGRAPHICALLY ISOLATED SITUATED ERRORS ARE TOO EXPENSIVE FOR CRYSTAL THEM. IN A COMMUNITY KEEP IN MIND THE VINEYARDS ARE RURAL INDUSTRY AND OFTEN AND NOT CLOSE TO POPULATION CENTERS. THIS B. AS A REPLACEMENT DRIVE LONG DISTANCES TO GET TO WORK IS WELL DOCUMENTED THAT TOO MANY AGGRAVATE OVERCROWDED HOUSING. THE THEY CANNOT FIND OF HOUSING IN THEIR COMMUNITIES SO THEY SCRAMBLE INTO THE BEST THEY CAN. WITH THIS REALITY IN MIND MANY GROWERS WANT TO HELP AB WORKERS BY PROVIDING HOUSING FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES. BUT THIS IS A UNBELIEVABLY CHALLENGING ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA THIS CALIFORNIA LAW MAKES INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO BUILD HOUSING. MORE RECENTLY COVERED RESTRICTIONS FOR HOUSING TREAT A HOUSE LIKE A WORKPLACE MAKING IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO PROVIDE HOUSING. DISCOLORATIONS DON'T RECOGNIZE AN EMPLOYER PROVIDED HOUSING IS INSPECTED ANNUALLY IS SAFE AND AS HEALTHY OPPORTUNITY TO PARTNER WITH EMPLOYERS AND INDUSTRY TO PROVIDE HOUSING THE STATE HAS INSTEAD MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT. LABOR SHORTAGES THAT THE ENTIRE PROBLEM ANOTHER CONSIDERATION OF FACTORS TECHNOLOGY IS INCREASING SIZE OF CALIFORNIA VINEYARDS. THE AVERAGE CALIFORNIA VINEYARD IS APPROACHING CLOSE TO TWO HUNDRED SIXTY ACRES IN SIZE. YOUR THE TIME CONSTRAINTS OF A GREAT OF THE PRODUCTION THESE BUSINESS CANNOT PRACTICALLY BE MANAGED WITH LABOR MANUAL LABOR ALONE. IS ALSO INTERESTING TO NOTE THE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THE MECHANIZATION OF MEDICATIONS IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE GRAPES. AND THE CONSISTENCY OF THE GREAT FROM BLOCK TO BLOCK WITHIN THE VINEYARD. SO THE NEED IS CLEAR WE NEED TO MOVE TOWARDS GREATER USE OF TECHNOLOGY IN VINEYARDS. THAT FACT IS WITHOUT QUESTION. THEREFORE LET ME ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES. IN MAKING THE SHIFT TO AUTOMATION AND MECHANISATION. THE MECHANIZATION CALIFORNIA VINEYARDS BEGAN MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS AGO WITH THE CHEMICAL HARVESTING GRAPES TODAY 90% OF CALIFORNIA'S VINEYARDS ARE MECHANICALLY HARVESTED AND THERE'S BEEN A MAJOR FOCUS OF MECHANIZATION. HOWEVER HARVESTING IS JUST THE START. COMING TO MAKE IT AS PRACTICES CAN ALSO INCLUDE PRUNING SHOOT THINNING BASIL LEAF REMOVAL HEDGING AND PRE HARVEST CROP REMOVAL. 65% OF VINEYARDS ARE MECHANICALLY PRE PROVEN WELL OTHER PRACTICES DO NOT USE AS MUCH MECHANIZATION FOR EXAMPLE ONLY 45% OF VINEYARDS HAVE MECHANIZED LEAF REMOVAL 7% HAVE MECHANIZED SHOOTING. ONLY 7% OF VINEYARDS HAVE FRUIT REMOVAL ONLY 2% OF IN YEARS HI SHOOT POSITIONING. RAP ADVANCES IN MACINNES OF ALSO OCCUR DUE TO THE COEVOLUTION OF MACHINES BY TRADING SYSTEMS AND BEEN YOUR DESIGN. THIS IS SPONSORING THE DEVELOPMENT. OF INTEGRATED PRODUCTION SYSTEMS. CURRENT MECHANIZATION RESEARCH IN CALIFORNIA IS FOCUSED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF AUTOMATED CROP LOAD MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES UTILIZING SENSORY TECHNOLOGY SIMULTANEOUSLY MEASURE AND MANAGE CANOPY AND CROPSCIENCE. PLEASE REMEMBER THOUGH THAT THE CUSTOMISATION IS NOT CHEAP FOR SOME GROWERS IT COULD TAKE FIVE TO TEN YEARS TO PAY OFF THAT INVESTMENT. KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA FARMERS WITH BONE YARDS BEHIND THE SHOP FEEL WITH THE BENCHES THAT JUST DIDN'T WORK OUT OVER A COMPLETE LOSS. ADDITIONALLY THERE'S A COST OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THAT TECHNOLOGY FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE MOVING FROM DIESEL TO ELECTRIC THAT MEANS UPGRADING YOUR LEFT WILL CHARGING CAPACITY THIS MAY INCLUDE SOLAR PANELS AND POWER STORAGE THIS COULD ALSO INCLUDE GENERATORS THAT COULD BE USED IN REMOTE AREAS. THIS ALSO MEANS SERVICING THE NEW ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT SOME ROADS WE NEED A HIGHER ELECTRIC MOTOR MECHANICS OR TECHNICIANS VERSES TRADITIONAL DIESEL MECHANICS. ADDITIONALLY IF A GIRL WANTS TO RETROFIT AN EXISTING TRACTOR TO BECOME A THOMAS THIS IS A ONE TIME INVESTMENT OF THE HARDWARE TO DO THAT AND THEN I'M GOING ANNUAL PAYMENT OF THE SOFTWARE THIS QUICKLY GETS IN THE TENS. OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS PER TRACTOR MECHANIZATION REDUCE THE DEMAND FOR LABOR. WHEN A GROWER SPACE OF NOT ENOUGH A PLACE TO DO THE WORK MECHANIZATION CAN BE A LIFESAVER. MECHANICAL PUTTING FOR EXAMPLE A LUMINOUS A DAY FOR LABOR BY AS MUCH AS EIGHTY PERCENT. MECHANICAL PUTTING COULD SAVE BETWEEN 6280% OF LABOR OPERATION COST PER ACRE. COMPARED TO MANUAL PRUNING. HOWEVER THIS IS JUST DOT THIS IS NOT JUST ACROSS ISSUE WE ALSO CREATING HIGHER PAYING JOBS. WITH MECHANIZATION WITH ON THE JOB TRAINING AND THE CONDITION OF TECHNOLOGY EMPLOYERS HAVE INCREASED OPPORTUNITIES TO GET THE NECESSARY SKILLS. FOR THOSE HIGHER PAYING POSITIONS. EMPLOYERS CAN CLIMB THE LADDER WITHIN AGRICULTURE. WHICH A JUDICIAL IT KEPT UP EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM MAY NOT A PROVIDER FOR THEM. IS ALSO INTERESTING TO NOTE. THE MECHANIZATION CAN INCREASE THE INCOME OF THE WORKER. KEEP IN MIND THE GRAPES TAKE THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME TO MANAGE REGARDLESS OF THE MOTIVE MANAGEMENT. WELL WITH MECHANIZATION A GIRL CAN GET MORE DONE WITH FEWER PEOPLE. THOSE EMPLOYERS ARE GETTING MORE HOURS WITH GREATER INCOME. CONSEQUENTLY WITH THE DECLINING AG WORKFORCE MECHANIZATION MEANS LESS LABOR INTENSIVE WORK. AND HIGHER LEVELS OF INCOME. MEG IS CAN ALL BE USED TO KEEP EMPLOYEES SAFE FOR EXAMPLE GROWERS CAN USE REMOTE OPERATED IRRIGATION CONTROLS TO TURN OFF AND ON WATER MONITOR VINEYARD HEALTH THROUGH MULTI SPECTRAL IMAGERY WITH DRONES. NEWS MCAT MECHANIZED HARVEST TO LIMIT THE EXPOSURE OF EMPLOYEES DURING SITUATIONS A BETTER QUALITY. HOWEVER THERE'S STILL A TREMENDOUS NEED TO PREPARE AG EMPLOYERS FOR WORKPLACE THAT DEMANDS HIGHLY SKILLED EXPERIENCED WORKERS WHO CAN MAKE THE ON. THE KIND OF ON THE SPOT DECISION THE MACHINES CARE ACT FOR THIS EMPLOYEES NEED TO BE TRAINED IN THE TECHNOLOGY. CONSEQUENTLY THERE IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY HERE FOR CAREER TECH TRAINING NEED TO ENCOURAGE COMMUNITY COLEGE PROGRAMS IN A PRESSURE PROGRAMS THE TRAIN THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA'S AT WORK FORCE. MORE THAN A DECADE OF RESEARCH HAS CONDUCTED WAS CONDUCTED AND WHY GREAT VICTIMIZATION PROPER EXTENSION UC DAVIS PART OF THE CULTURE AND ANALOGY IS REPORT FINDING THERE'S STILL A NEED FOR GROWERS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND. HOW TO MAXIMIZE THE VALUE OF THAT MECHANIZATION. WITH ALL THIS IN MIND I HAVE TO SAY THAT THE FUTURE MECHANIZATION AND AUTOMATION ENGINEERS MUST INCLUDE A THOMAS TRACTORS AND UTILIZATION OF THAT TECHNOLOGY. THE CHALLENGE HERE THOUGH IS THAT A CALIFORNIA THAT TECHNOLOGY IS VIRTUALLY UNAVAILABLE DUE TO REGULATORY ROADBLOCKS. CALIFORNIA LEADS THE NATION IN OUR EFFORTS TO PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT. THE SOME CALIFORNIA REGULATIONS ARE DECADES BEHIND THE ADVANCES IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. ALSO BELIEVE THOSE REGULATIONS SERVE AS A ROADBLOCK. TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE CALLOUS CHEATING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS THAT THERE MUST BE AN EMPLOYEE PHYSICALLY ON BOARD ANY OF THOMAS TRACTOR. IN THE AGE OF REMOTE CONTROL SPACE FLIGHT THIS REGULATION SEEMS UNINFORMED AND NONSENSICAL. TWENTY NINE STATES HAVE ALREADY PASSED LEGISLATION RELATING TO THE SAFE USE OF ON THE ROAD TESTING OF AUTONOMOUS CARS AND TRUCKS. SOME OF THE STATE'S ALLOW USE OF THE VEHICLE WITH NO DRIVER ON BOARD. JUST THIS MORNING THE TODAY ISSUED A REPORT ON THE SCIENCE AND USE OF AUTONOMOUS TRUCKS IN RETAIL AND FREIGHT. DRIVERLESS CARS AND TRUCKS ARE CLEARLY IN OUR FUTURE IN CALIFORNIA AND THE WORLD. AND EXCELLING TODAY'S AUTONOMOUS TRACTORS SURVEY. THIS FEATURE A VARIETY OF SAFETY PERPETRATORS THERE WERE PROVEN TRACK RECORD OF SAFETY. THERE DOZENS OF USES FOR THIS TECHNOLOGY INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO ANALYZE MOISTURE LEVELS. ASSESSED PEST PRESSURE COMPOSTERS AND PERFORM OTHER CRUCIAL FUNCTIONS. IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT MANY DISTRACTORS ARE ELECTRIC WILL RUN LIKE A TEN PLUS HOURS. THIS EQUIPMENT IS ZERO EMISSIONS AS A GREAT TOOL IMPRECISE PEST CONTROL EFFORTS AND WATER CONSERVATION. I K. AS CALIFORNIA MOVES AWAY FROM DIESEL FARM EQUIPMENT AND ALL SCHOOL TECHNOLOGY. ONE DRAWER DESCRIBE THE ATOMIC STRUCTURES QUOTE THE MYSTIC LAKE AND THE SUSTAINABLE CYCLE. IF I LEAVE YOU WITH A CLEAR TAKEAWAY FROM TODAY'S HEARING PLEASE CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING. WE CAN SAVE WATER BY USING THIS TECHNOLOGY TO MEASURE WHEN AND WHERE IRRIGATION IS NEEDED. WE CAN REDUCE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT BY MOVING FROM DIESEL TO ELECTRIC. WE CAN REDUCE THE USE OF PESTICIDES THEY USE THIS TECHNOLOGY TO CLOSELY MONITOR PEST ISSUES AND PRECISELY RESPOND. WE CAN HELP GROW CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY USING TECHNOLOGY SOME OF WHICH IS VERY FACTUAL RATE HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO INCREASE OUR YIELDS. IF WE TRULY WANT TO HELP CALIFORNIA FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE A PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT. LET'S REMOVE THE UNNECESSARY REGULATORY ROADBLOCKS THE FULL UTILIZATION OF OUR CURRENT TECHNOLOGY. THOSE REGULATIONS ALSO SERVE AS A ROADBLOCK. THE CALIFORNIA'S SUSTAINABILITY. DILEMMAS ARISE AS THE WAY THE SUMMER THE USE OF CAL. THIS OF MECHANISATION. CALIFORNIA VINEYARDS. INCLUDING A TOWN PHARMICA IS. THE FOR SISTER AG INDUSTRY CALIFORNIA AUTOMATION IS A CRITICAL PILLAR OF CALIFORNIA'S AG FUTURE. BUT WE STILL NEED SOME HELP SPECIFICALLY. WE NEED TO FIX THE OSHA REGULATION WHICH I DISCUSSED A BIT AGO. WE ALSO NEED TO CONTINUE FUNDING EFFORTS TO DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY THEY'LL HELP DISPOSE OF OLD VINES WITHOUT BURNING THEM. THIS IS A HUGE ISSUE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND WILL BE ALSO FOR THE STATE. ADDITIONALLY WE NEED HELP TO SUPPORT UNIVERSAL CALIFORNIA UC EXTENSION CSU AND THE EFFORTS OF HIGHER EDUCATION ABOUT RESEARCHING THE TECHNOLOGY. TRAINING OF WORKERS. AND EDUCATING THE INDUSTRY. BY LATE WHEN IT SUPPORT TECH TRAINING TO PREPARE AG EMPLOYEES FOR NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT OUR CULTURE. SOME NONPROFITS OF FILLING THIS VOID THROUGH PENSION PROGRAMS BUT THEY ARE FACED. WITH THE BURDENSOME AND UNNECESSARY REGULATION THAT REQUIRES THEM TO REGISTER AS A FARM LABOR CONTRACTOR. AGAIN THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS OF STAFF FOR ALL THEIR SUPPORT HEARING AND I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. QUESTIONS FROM BOARD. H. COOPER THANK YOU MICHAEL FOR PRISON IT WAS VERY INFORMATIVE- YOU TALKED ABOUT THE VINES OF THE OLD VINES THEY'RE STACKED UP ALTHOUGH A RECENT TOUR DOWN THE VALLEY AND I SAW STACKS AND STACKS OF OLD LINE'S BEEN TORN UP AS WELL AS TREES BECAUSE THEY ONLY HAVE A CERTAIN LIFE SPAN THEY DON'T LAST FOREVER NOT FOREVER THEY KEEP STACKING UP AND THAT'S REALLY BEEN A BIG ISSUE FOR YOU THE WINEGROWERS WELLS OTHER CROP GROWERS. AND WE'VE YOU GUYS ARE GETTING NO RELIEF FROM- KELLY P. AIR I'M SORRY CARB SO WE DID GET SOME FUNDING THE BUDGET FOR THE ENSEMBLE CARE BOARD TO DEVELOP TECHNOLOGIES TO WORK WITH US AND THEN RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM THEY HAVE SOME GRANT PROGRAMS AVAILABLE TO HELP GROWERS IN THE SHORT TERM BUT THE LONG TERM WE STILL TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS TO DEAL WITH- WITH WHAT WE DO TAKE OUT OF AND I'LL SPEAK TO THE VENUE PART OF IT- THE OTHER PROVIDERS HAVE ISSUES AS WELL. BUT REMEMBER WHEN YOU TAKE OUT A VINEYARD THE VINEYARD HAS HAS SHOP LIKE A TWENTY FIVE THIRTY YEARS WHATEVER IT IS AND NOW IT'S NOT PRODUCING ANYMORE WHEN YOU TAKE IT DOWN YOU TAKE OUT EVERYTHING THAT'S PART OF IT SO ALL OF THAT METAL THAT IS THOSE INSIDE THE BANK COMES DOWN AND YOU CAN'T PULL IT OUT OF THE- OUT OF OUT OF OUT OF THE BY BECAUSE IT'S TOO LABOR INTENSIVE SO ALL THAT GOES INTO A BIG STACK. YOU CAN'T BE A CHIP THAT YOU CAN'T BECAUSE OF THE METAL AND IT YOU CAN'T BURN IT BECAUSE WERE MOVING QUITE ACT BURN SO THAT LEAVES YOU WITH VERY FEW OPTIONS AND WE NEED TO REALLY PURSUE A SUSTAINABLE LONG TERM SOLUTION TO THAT CHALLENGE AND WE'RE WORKING ON THAT BUT WE HAVE THREE YEARS BASICALLY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO WITH THOSE VINEYARDS AND IT'S A BIG. ISSUE DISTRICTS. I YOU. SELECT THANK VERY MUCH OF A MR MILLER- WAS A STRICT TO COME HE MADE WITH WITH RESPECT HOUSING AND ISSUE THE IMPACT THE WORK FOR BUT ASK YOURS TO SEE IF THEY CAN SO OF ONE GROWERS- TAKE- EFFORTS TO HELP ADVOCATE FOR A NUMBER OF THE HOUSING LEGISLATION THAT WE HAD IN THE LEGISLATURE IN THE PREVIOUS YEARS WE HAVE ACTUAL WORK CLOSELY WITH- THIS IS YOUR CURRY WAS SENATOR DODD- TWO OR THREE DIFFERENT HOUSING BILLS PLUS WE WORKED WITH THE- CAL OSHA ON THEIR PROGRAMS TO DO WITH HOW YOU TREAT THE OF THE- THE HOUSING SITUATION WHERE IT'S A PART OF OUR HOUSING RELATIVE TO WORKPLACE SAFETY THOSE KINDS OF THINGS SO EVEN. IF THE PUTTING ASIAN APPROACH AND THAT AND THAT AND THAT WILL DISCUSS OF GREAT IN THE STORE THEN CONTINUE LEAD TO BE ADVOCATING FOR A NUMBER OF HOUSING BILLS- TO THE LET ME VERY MUCH LIKE THAT YES IT'S GREAT AND THEN THE OTHER- POINT THAT YOU MADE WAS- WITH FACT TO A TONS VEHICLES- AND YOU REFERENCED A POINT THAT THAT MANY OF THE TECHNOLOGIES ARE HOME GROWN HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS VERY TRUE TO. HAVE YOU BEEN IN CONVERSATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION OTHER ENTITIES TO HELP ADVOCATE TO BEGIN THE FRAME WORK TO HELP SUPPORT SUCH TECHNOLOGIES AS WE WERE WORKING MORE WITH THE MANUFACTURERS DIRECTLY OKAY BUT IT TO ANY WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO HAVE ANY OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO THE REASON I ASK IS BECAUSE I I'VE BEEN IN CONVERSATION WITH SOME OF THE COMPANIES THEMSELVES ALSO IN SILICON VALLEY AND TO HEAR YOUR ENGAGEMENT AND SUPPORT OF THAT AS WELL I THINK TO HELP AMPLIFY THE MESSAGE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF SUPPORTING THE TECHNOLOGY HERE. OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS MET JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO WE DISCUSSES A SHOW LIKE IS ONE OF OUR HIGHEST PRIORITIES AT TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND WE ARE ENGAGED AND. ARE VERY HELPFUL. OBESITY IS A THAT YOU HAVE YEAH ONE'S GOING THAT I GET THAT THAT'S NOT. BEEN OF HAVING THIS HEARING TO. BECAUSE I DIDN'T I IT WAS MADE AWARE THAT THE- THIS WELL TO AN- OF COURSE. A NUMBER OF THE- MANY IN THE INDUSTRY. ARE LOOKING AT OTHER STATES IN WHICH THEY'RE ROLLING OUT THE RED CARPET IN SAYING HERE. THE RULES RAGS AND DOES NOT BEEN. SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE ANTICIPATED BUT- IT JUSTICE BGGLES OUR MIND THAT WE MIGHT NOT SUPPORT THAT HERE GIVEN ITS- HOME GROWN TECHNOLOGIES. THAT COULD AGREE MORE EFFORT FOR WINE GRAPES AND BEING. WE ARE ABLE. IN YOU KNOW INDUSTRY WE COMPETE WITH. I THINK WE'RE THE FIFTH LARGEST CALIFORNIA'S THE FIFTH LARGEST WINE PRODUCER. IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW COMPARED TO. ITALY FRANCE SPAIN- SUBIN. IT IS A HUGE ISSUE FOR US YES I AGREE. GREAT THANK YOU. THEN JUST ONE MORE THING THOSE JURISDICTIONS DON'T. FACE THE SAME CONSTRAINTS WE FACE YOU FACE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. TO BE TO BE MORE BROADLY CLEAR NOW DON'T THE SAME CONSTRAINTS WE FACE. OFTENTIMES THOSE COUNTRIES AT THE ACTUALLY SUBSIDIZE THE INDUSTRY BIGGER MARKETING MONEY FROM- FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND THEY GET THE SYSTEM TO RESEARCH THAT CALIFORNIA DOESN'T GET. AND IT'S A BIG COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE TRUST THAT'S THAT ARE ONE IS THE BEST IN THE NATION PLEASE PLEASE. MISTER RODRIGUEZ. THANK MICHAEL THANK YOU MEANT OF SURE PRESENTE AND I THINK THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT WITH TECHNOLOGY AND WHAT WE'LL BE LOOKING AT IN THE FUTURE BUT I JUST WANTED TO TOUCH BASE ON SOME YOU TALK ABOUT REAL BRIEFLY IN THE OPENING REMARKS REGARDING LABOR ARE IN REGARDS TO H. TWO A. VISA HOLDERS IN THE REASON WHY I SAY THIS IDEA DID WAS PICKING UP SOME LEGISLATION AROUND THAT AND I DID DO A- A RIGHT ALONG WITH THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING TASK FORCE MY DISTRICT A COUPLE MONTHS AGO. AND CAME ACROSS SOME OF THE- THE WORKERS OUT THERE UNFORTUNATELY THERE WERE H. TWO A. VISA HOLDERS ARE WORKING IN THE AG INDUSTRY AND- GOING BACK TO WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THE GROUP OF WORKERS- WHAT IS INDUSTRY DOING TO PROTECT THOSE H. TWO A. VISA WORKERS BECAUSE I SEEN REPORTS THAT THOSE A GROUP OF- A CHOI WITH BOBBY SO HOLDERS ARE THE MOST TRAFFIC IT- IN THAT ARENA SO WONDER WHAT WERE THE ENTRY IS WITHOUT PROTECTING THOSE WORKERS IN MAKING SURE THAT GETTING THE SUPPORT IN AND RESOURCES THEY NEED THAT THEY'RE NOT OUT THERE BEING DRAFTED. AS I'VE SEEN AND I SHE REPORTS SO JUST WANTED PICKING BACK ON THIS ENTRY BROUGHT IT UP AT THE BEGINNING I'M HAPPY TO SET US UP FOR THE FOR THE WINE GRAPE INDUSTRY- AGENCE ADDITION AFFORDABILITY SALUTE THE GROSS WHO CAN AFFORD TO SPEND THAT PROGRAM BECAUSE REMEMBER YOU HAVE TO HIRE LEGAL TEAM YOU HAVE TO REACH FOR TRANSPORTATION YET TO PROVIDE FREE HOUSING THAT HAVE COMPETITIVE WAGES AND BENEFITS THEY'RE ABOVE YOU BELOW WHAT IS PAID TO THE EDGE OF THE AVERAGE AG RECURSOS. THE GROSS TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT PROGRAM A DIFFICULT TOWARDS THAT THE NUMBERS RIVAS IS ON A TOUR OF ONE OF THESE FACILITIES WE DO A LOT OF EDUCATION WITH THEM WE'RE CLOSE WITH THE FARM BUREAU AND OTHER AG ORGANIZATIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE GROWERS KNOW WHAT IS REQUIRED THAT THAT THAT THAT'S INSPECTED AND ALL THAT AND THAT THAT THE PROPOSAL IS VERY HIGH AND WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT IN TALKING TO BETTER THE GROWERS AND I'VE GOT MYSELF AND TALKED WITH THE WORKERS. DIRECTLY THEY COME BACK YEAR AFTER YEAR THEY'RE NOT GROWING THEY'RE NOT FEWER WORKERS WERE UNHAPPY IN THEIR JOB THEY COME BACK EVERY YEAR AND THEY THEY DO BY CHOICE THEY DON'T WANT TO MOVE TO CALIFORNIA THEY WERE TO COME TO CALIFORNIA PREPARED. OF TIME THE I A STAY AT HOME. THEY PROVIDE THE MONEY. INTO THE FOR AT HOME. WAS A- THEIR FOR. AND THEY HOUSING EDUCATION. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T MAKE MONEY IN AND THAT'S- SO. THE PROGRAM AT WORKS FOR ALL OF THE- AND THEY DO COME BACK. YEAR AFTER AFTER YEAR. I TALKED TO WAS WORKERS DIRECTLY. CAN GREAT THANK. MANORIAL WALDRON THANK YOU REAL QUICK- AS KNOW HAVE TO MACULA ON THE VINEYARDS THERE- WHEN I'VE TALKED THE GROWER IN ALL THROUGH THE YEARS THE DEALING WITH- YOU KNOW SOME OF THEM ARE STILL DOING IT THE OLD WAY A LOT OF THEM ARE TRYING TO LOOK INTO THINGS LIKE SYSTEMIC MONITORING- TO LOOK AT BASICALLY SOIL PROFILES THROUGHOUT THEIR AREA HOW MUCH WATER IS IN THE GROUND IN ONE PLACE VERSUS ANOTHER HUMIDITY IN THE AIR THAT CAN EVEN. WITH THE MODERN TECHNOLOGY. CHECK THE GRAVE RIGHT THIS. BUT FOR THE MOST PART THEY'RE DRIVING A TRACTOR AROUND WITH THE PERSON IN IT LOOKING TO CHECK. OR LOOKING FOR MILDEW AND ROT WHICH IS A BIG ISSUE- YOU KNOW THEY'RE GENERALLY JUST DOING SPRING WEATHER THIS MILDURA. AT ALL. AND I THINK TECHNOLOGY THAT IS A HUGE AREA FOR HELP IN THAT REGARD. BUT YOU KNOW ONCE AGAIN WE HAVE THOSE BARRIERS ARE HOW ARE PEOPLE GOING TO. ACCESS SAID HOW THE GOING TO BE TRAINED TO USE IT AND- YOU KNOW THE COST SO. THIS IS THE COMMON. THANK YOU SEE AREA- MISTRAL QUESTION. ON YOUR PROFESSIONAL OPINION DO YOU SEE TAX ELIMINATING JOBS. NO I REALLY DON'T I SEE TECH IS ACTUALLY CREATING JOBS FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS ONE IS. WHAT WHAT DO YOU LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE IN A WORKFORCE IT'S AN AGING WORKFORCE. AND YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF NEW YOUNGER PEOPLE COMING IN AND IT'S A LOT BECAUSE THEY THEY THEY CAN GET. LESS PHYSICALLY DEMANDING JOBS AND OTHER INDUSTRIES OKAY. AT THE SAME TIME THEIF YOU WANT TO TRACK THOSE NEW EMPLOYEES INTO THIS INDUSTRY AND WORKING IN A IN A VINEYARD. GIVE THEM THE ABILITY TO ONE IS A TRANSFERABLE SKILL WHICH IS YET TECHNOLOGY IF YOU'RE IF YOU REMOTE CONTROL OPERATING OF MACHINERY YOU'RE OR YOU'RE ANALYZING. ENTIRE VENUE FOR THE- IRRIGATION ISSUES PAST ISSUES OR WHATEVER. YOU'RE LEARNING THIS TECHNOLOGY AS A TRANSFERABLE SKILL. ON TOP OF THAT IF YOU'RE DOING THIS IN THAT USINESS THIS UPWARD MOBILITY WITHIN IT THAT BEARD OPERATION. SO IF ANYTHING I SEE TECHNOLOGY AS BEING SOETHING THAT WHILE THE TRACK RECORDS TO AGRICULTURE BECAUSE IT'S MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM. IT'S HIGHER PAID JOBS FOR THE POTENTIALLY. AND IT'S LESS. PHYSICALLY DEMANDING WORK. THIS YEAR. BAKER IS RUNNING THANK YOU ALL HAVE A GREAT DAY. WE ON. NEXT WE HAVE- CLAYTON COWDEN DEAN OF THE CAREER TECH TECH TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AT HARTNELL COLLEGE IN SALINAS CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU COMMITTEE FOR HAVING YOU CAN HEAR ME ALL RIGHT- AND AGAIN I'M VERY HUMBLED TO BE HERE MY NAME'S CLINT COWDEN AND I'M A DEAN OF A SMALL COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN SALINAS- CALIFORNIA UP I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN MY REMARKS WITH A PERSONAL STORY THAT I HAVE THAT I BELIEVE THIS CAPSULE IT'S KIND OF THIS TIMELESS CONNECTION BETWEEN AGRICULTURE AND TECHNOLOGY AND THAT CONTINUAL PURSUIT FOR THAT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. UP THIS STORY INVOLVES MY GREAT GRANDFATHER CW CURTIS WHO APPEARS IN A BLACK AND WHITE PHOTO ON THE FINAL PAGE OF THE FINAL BOOK IN THE TIME WHITE SERIES OLD WEST. HE'S RIDING A HORSE AND HE'S LOOKING OVER HIS SHOULDER AT AN AIRPLANE. THE PHOTO WAS TAKEN ON A RANCH IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES BACK IN WYOMING. THEN IN THE BOOK. THAT PHOTO IS USED TO SYMBOLIZE. THAT THE COWBOYS ARE KIND OF LOSING THE BATTLE TO TECHNOLOGY. BUT THE TRUTH IS EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE. MY GREAT GRANDFATHER HAD ACTUALLY HIRED THAT AIRPLANE TO FLY UP HIGH SO THEY CAN CIRCLE AROUND AND LOOK FOR STRIDES I WHEN THEY SEE STRAYS THEY TIP THEIR WINGS AND YOU KNOW WHERE THE CAMERA YOU DON'T HAVE TO WRITE AROUND ALL THE TIME. NOWADAYS IF WE MOVE FORWARD NOWADAYS THAT'S A DRONE THE COWBOYS PROBABLY ON A FOUR WHEELER HE'S GOT A GPS AND THAT INFORMATION IS BEING HOT BATCH RIGHT BACK TO THE OFFICE. AND SO WHEN WE REALLY LOOK AT THIS AGRICULTURE'S DEMAND FOR TECHNOLOGY IS A CONSISTENT FORCE WHERE WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT HOW CAN WE REDUCE OUR INPUTS INTO AGRICULTURE. ONE OF THOSE INPUTS IS EDUCATION AND WE STARTED TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION HERE TODAY AND HOW DO WE PREPARE THIS WORK FORCE THAT CAN DESIGN IMPLEMENT AND OPERATE. THAT TECHNOLOGY. AND CONTINUE TO UPSKILL THE WORK FORCE THAT WE HAVE TO KEEP THEM IN OUR WORK FORCE AND KEEP THEM. EVOLVING WITH THIS RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGY. AT HARTNELL COLLEGE IT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR US TO GO OUT THERE AND COMMUNICATE NOT ONLY WITH THE LARGE EMPLOYERS BUT ALSO WITH THE FOLKS THAT ARE STARTING AND CREATING THIS TECHNOLOGY. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND. IN ORDER TO PREPARE THE WORKFORCE. SO THAT THEY CAN OPERATE THE EQUIPMENT THAT WE HAVE ON THE FARM TODAY. BUT SO THEY CAN ALSO WE'VE ALL WITH THE TECHNOLOGY AS IT CONTINUES TO MOVE. A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THIS IS A CONVERSATION WE'RE HAVING RIGHT NOW WITH UC SANTA CRUZ AND SO UC SANTA CRUZ CAME OVER TO US AND THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT HEY LET'S CREATE. THIS DRONE PROGRAM. AND DO WE NEED A LICENSING THING AND WE REALLY LOOK AT IT A DRONE A SATELLITE- A FIXED WING AIRPLANE. IT'S REALLY ABOUT GOING OUT THERE AND GATHERING A LARGE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION AND THEN UTILIZING THAT INFORMATION TO MAKE THOSE QUALITY DECISIONS. SO WHAT WE'RE REALLY DOING IS GOING TO ADJUST THAT AND TRY TO RUN THAT TECHNOLOGY ACROSS MULTIPLE PROGRAMS SO IT'S NOT THAT TARGETED THING OF JUST A DRONE BUT HOW CAN WE USE THAT. SO MY FOCUS AT HARTNELL IS HOW DO WE DEVELOP THESE HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED WORK FORCE. MANY OF OUR DEGREE DEGREE SEEKING STUDENTS ARE FIRST GENERATION. LATINA X. FAMILIES THAT COME FROM YOU KNOW THE FARM WORKING WORLD. SOMETIMES THEY ARE GOING TO SHY AWAY FROM AGRICULTURE BECAUSE THEY'RE REALLY LOOKING AT GOING INTO AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT DIRECTION. SO PART OF OUR CHALLENGE IS HELPING THEM SEE THIS INCREDIBLE CAREER OPPORTUNITY THAT AWAITS THEM IN AGTECH. AND THESE CAREERS ARE RIGHT THERE IN THEIR BACKYARD. NOW AND MOVING FORWARD INTO THE FUTURE. LEARNING HOW TO IMPLEMENT TECHNOLOGIES THAT INCREASE EFFICIENCY AND YIELD WHILE DECREASING IMPORTS AT THE SAME TIME MAKING AG JOBS MORE HIGHLY SKILLED AND MORE ATTRACTIVE TO THE NEXT GENERATION. FOR EXAMPLE A SELF GUIDED TRACTOR WITH A VARIABLE RATE APPLICATION CAN TRACK THE INPUT APP THE INPUTS. THAT CAN BE USED TO DETERMINE THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO APPLY THOSE DIFFERENT INPUTS SUCH AS FERTILIZERS. WE THEN. CAN TAKE AND KEEP A LOG OF THOSE APPLICATIONS AND SO WE TRULY KNOW EXACTLY THAT SITE SPECIFIC CONCEPT OF WHERE AND HOW MUCH FERTILIZER WAS USED ON THAT FORM AND THEN WE CAN DO ABOUT JUST LIKE WE BALANCE OUR CHECKBOOKS WE CAN DO THAT NUTRIENT BALANCE RIGHT OUT THERE. THESE AND THERE THERE'S AN ENTIRE SEGMENT OF PLANT GENETICS FOR EXAMPLE DEVELOPING PLANS THEY CAN STAND UP COLLAR SO THAT THESE HARVEST THESE AUTOMATED HARVEST MACHINES CAN GO OUT THERE AND HARVEST. OR WORKING WITH PLANTS THAT ARE TRULY DESIGNED TO BE GROWN IN CLIMATE CONTROLLED GREENHOUSES. DRISKELL BERRIES S A LARGE- ALYSS GROWTH AND THERE FARMING TECHNICIANS ARE WORKING ALONGSIDE THE GENETICS TEAM TO REALLY LOOKING AT WHAT THOSE QUALITIES BEST SUIT FOR THOSE PLANTS TO BE GROWN IN THAT IN THAT TYPE OF LOCATION. INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT REQUIRES TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF TECHNOLOGY TO IDENTIFY THE INFESTATION AND THEN PROVIDE JUST IN TIME AROUND AT. THE RATIFICATION WITH THE LEAST IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT. MOST OF ARE STILL MOST OF OUR STUDENTS- ARE REALLY LOOKING AT AGRICULTURE CAREERS THAT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WE WOULDN'T EVEN I IDENTIFY AS AGRICULTURE. THEY WILL JOIN THE WORK FORCE IN WITH IN WHICH MATHEMATICIANS ENGINEERS BIOLOGISTS SALES PRODUCTION CREWS WORK TOGETHER TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. WE ALREADY HAVE SEEN THIS THROUGH THE OUR EXPANSION OF OUR INTERNSHIP PROGRAM AT HARTNELL WHERE WE TAKE OUR MATH STUDENTS AND THEY'RE WORKING ON YIELD FORECASTING FOR SPECIFIC SOFTWARE WE'RE HAVING OUR BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY STUDENTS WORKING ON AN E. COLI GENETICS PRODUCTS SO AGAIN GETTING THEM IN THERE AND TRULY SEEING WHAT THE SCIENCE. IS OUT THERE DOING. IN THE KEY WITH THE INTERNSHIPS IS BECAUSE AS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER WITH THREE TO FOUR HUNDRED DIFFERENT COMMODITIES WITH. TWO HUNDRED DIFFERENT JOB TITLES PER COMMODITY. THAT COULD BE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF COLLEGE CLASSES SO THESE INTERNSHIPS ARE REALLY THIS GREAT WAY TO REDUCE THAT CREATION OF A MYRIAD OF COLLEGE COURSES. STUDENTS GAIN REAL WORLD EXPERIENCE IN THE INDUSTRY IS PROVIDED A WELL TRAINED QUALIFIED WORKFORCE. THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS WERE REALLY FOCUSED ON TO TRY TO REDUCE THE BRAIN DRAIN FROM THE SALINAS VALLEY. MANY OF OUR STUDENTS TO CHOOSE STEM FIELDS DO THAT PER PACK PRECISELY BECAUSE THEY'RE LOOKING AT THESE OTHER AREAS. INTERNSHIPS ARE THE APPLIED LEARNING EXPERIENCES THAT THOSE STUDENTS THAT ARE INTERESTED IN ENGINEERING BIOTECH COMPUTER SCIENCE CAN DISCOVER THAT CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE ISN'T WHAT THEY IMAGINE. THEY GET TO USE THEIR THEORETICAL KNOWLEDGE IN THESE HIGH. TECH AREAS- AND TO GET TO WORK IN THEIR BACKYARD. THE INTERNSHIPS ARE PAID SO THAT THE STUDENTS CAN SCHEME CAN GAIN THE RELATIVE SKILLS. BUT THEY ALSO NEED TO THAT WAGE TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES. ANOTHER IMPORTANT GROUP AND I LOVE IT THAT THIS GROUP IS ALREADY TOUCHING ON THIS. IS A STE THE PEOPLE THERE ALREADY WORKING IN OUR AG INDUSTRY. I TEND TO CALL THOSE STUDENTS AND GRANTS IN THAT WORLD. THE INCUMBENT WORKERS. WE HAVE JOINED WITH EMPLOYERS TO OFFER NON CREDIT COURSES THAT PREPARE THAT WORKFORCE FOR THESE NEW ROLES AND THEIR COMPANIES ARE ABLE TO. START TO EXPAND THEIR TECHNOLOGY AND THEIR AUTOMATION AS THEIR WORK FORCE GAINES THESE NEW THESE NEW THIS NEW TRAINING. THEY CAN TAKE THE COURSES IN THE EVENINGS AND GAIN NEW SKILLS THAT QUALIFY THEM FOR THESE NEW OPPORTUNITIES. WE ARE ABLE TO LEARN NEW THINGS SUCH AS MECHATRONICS AND SO RIGHT NOW OUR COLLEGES IS STARTING A BRAND NEW MECHATRONICS PROGRAM IN JANUARY. AND WE'VE INSTALLED A TWO MILLION DOLLAR SMART FACTORY. WHERE STUDENTS CAN FOCUS ON INTEGRATED LOGISTICS COMMUNICATION MECHATRONICS ROBOTIC ASSEMBLY AND TROUBLESHOOTING CAPACITIES. NOT ONLY WAS THIS TECHNOLOGY FUNDED BY A PRODUCE LEADER TAYLOR FARMS THAT'S HEAD QUARTERED IN SALINAS BUT WE ALSO TOURED A LOT OF ADVANCED FOOD MANUFACTURING FACILITIES MET WITH EMPLOYERS AND REALLY FOCUSED ON WHAT IS THE ENDGAME TO CREATE WHERE WE WANTED TO GO. WE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED OUR TRAINING LAB IN OUR CURRICULUM TO ADDRESS BOTH OUTSIDE IN THE FIELD BUT ALSO IN THE PROCESSING OF THAT FOOD. SO STUDENTS CAN UNDERSTAND THE AGRA NAMIK MANAGEMENT OF THE SOIL AND THE WEATHER BUT ALSO THE INTEGRATION OF THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY AS WE MOVE FORWARD. WE WANT TO GIVE OUR STUDENTS THAT HANDS ON SKILLS SO THEY CAN HIT THE GROUND RUNNING. THE SIMPLE FACT IS MANY OF OUR STUDENTS ONCE THEY GET OUT FROM OUR COLLEGE PROGRAMS ARE EXPECTED TO. COME IN AND REALLY TURN A PROFIT WITHIN THE FIRST TWO WEEKS SO GIVING THOSE TRUE HANDS ON SKILLS ARE SO IMPORTANT STUDENTS GREAT UNDERSTANDINGS OF FLUID DYNAMICS ELECTRICITY AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS THAT CAN HELP THEM SO THAT AS SYSTEMS INVOLVED OVER THE NEXT FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS. THEY'RE READY TO MEET THOSE CHALLENGES. WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT NOT. THAT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE. THAT NOT JUST OUR AG TECH STUDENTS BUT STUDENTS HOLISTICALLY NOW ARE REALLY LIFETIME LEARNERS. NGUYEN THEY MAY HAVE TAKEN THE SOILS CLASS OR PLANT SCIENCE CLASS IN THE PAST. BUT OVER THE LAST THREE FIVE SEVEN YEARS SO MANY THINGS HAVE CHANGED SO WE SEE A LOT OF THE STUDENTS COMING BACK IN NEEDING TO RETAKE THOSE CLASSES. TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY CAN INTEGRATE THE TECHNOLOGY WITH THE THEORY THAT THEY'VE USED BEFORE AND THIS IS WHERE COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS SUCH A GREAT ADVANTAGE BECAUSE WE'RE RIGHT THERE IN THEIR BACKYARDS- BUT WE DO NEED TO RE EXAMINE SOME OF THE RESTRICTIONS THE COLLEGE STUDENTS FACE. BECAUSE MANY MANY OF OUR CLASSES ARE YOU TAKE A ONCE AND THEN YOU'RE DONE. BUT REALLY THIS IS ALREADY STARTING TO HAPPEN AND MOST OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES CAN SAY SIMILAR STORIES. AT HARTNELL WE HAVE A FOOD SAFETY PROGRAM FOR ABOUT A THIRD OF OUR STUDENTS. HAVE A BACHELORS DEGREE IN SOMETHING LIKE AG BUSINESS OR MICROBIOLOGY BUT BECAUSE OF A CAREER CHANGER PIVOT THEY'RE COMING BACK TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO UNDERSTAND. HOW DO I DO THAT PAPERWORK WHAT AM I GONNA EXPECT WHEN THE AUDITOR COMES ON TO OUR ONTO OUR FARM. AND THAT IS WHERE HARTNELL AND OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGES CAN CAN REALLY HELP BECAUSE WE CAN COME IN AND TEACH THOSE HARD SKILLS. SO WHEN WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT OUR STUDENTS IT'S REALLY A BIFURCATED APPROACH AND ONE IN WHICH WE WANT TO EMBRACE OUR TRADITIONAL STUDENTS THOSE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS THAT JUST GRADUATED. BUT WE ALSO REALLY NEED TO EMBRACE AND ATTRACT THE ADULT STUDENTS THAT HAVE BEEN OUT THERE WORKING FOR TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS. THE EIGHTEEN AND NINETEEN YEAR OLDS THEY NEED TO SEE HOW THEY FIT INTO THIS CONTINUE ON THE BACK PRODUCTION UNDERSTAND THAT PART BUT THEY NEED HOSE ADDITIONAL HARD TO FIND SKILLS THAT WILL QUALIFY THEM FOR THE HIGHER PAYING ROLES AS A TECHNICIAN. OR HOW THEY CAN INCORPORATE THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY INTO THEIR CURRENT JOB. AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL WE'RE EXCITED. TO MEET THESE CHALLENGES AND WE RECOGNIZE THE CENTRAL ROLE IN MEETING THIS WORKFORCE NEED FOR THE AG INDUSTRY. FIRST WE MUST WORK EVEN HARDER TO HELP OUR STUDENTS SEE THEMSELVES IN THIS HIGH TECH TECHNOLOGY. AND STEPPING INTO THESE INTO THIS FUTURE. ACHIEVING THIS ON A LARGE SCALE MAY REQUIRE A STATE WIDE AWARENESS CAMPAIGN. NOT UNLIKE WHAT MUST MANY OF THE RUST BELT STATES DID FOR ADVANCED MANUFACTURING. SECONDLY WE ARE INCREASINGLY HELPING EMPLOYERS SHIFT THEIR CURRENT EMPLOYEES INTO AUTOMATED HARVESTING AND PROCESSING AND THEN TRAINING THEM ALL THESE DATA DRIVEN TO DATA. DRIVEN DECISIONS AND JUST IN TIME MANAGEMENT. AND FINALLY% WE ARE ALSO GRAPPLING WITH THE OTHER REALITY THAT I MENTIONED. AG EDUCATION CAN NO LONGER BE A ONE AND DONE THING. TECHNOLOGY THAT COMPANIES RELY ON TODAY CAN QUICKLY BECOME OUTDATED SO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN PROVIDE CAREER LONG TRAINING TO HELP WORKERS REMAIN RELEVANT. OUR TEACHING TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE HAVE ALSO HAVE TO KEEP UP WITH THIS CONTINUAL IMPROVING AND CYCLE THAT THAT AGRICULTURE'S MOVING THROUGH. WE KNOW THERE'S NO SUBSTITUTE FOR HANDS ON LEARNING AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT- BUT THAT OFTEN CAN OCCUR IN THOSE INTERNSHIPS THAT I'VE DISCUSSED. HOWEVER SCALING UP THERE THE AVAILABILITY FOR PAID INTERNSHIPS WILL REQUIRE FUNDING AT HARTNELL COLLEGE WERE EAGER TO SEE MORE AND MORE OF OUR STUDENTS. PURSUING REWARDING CAREERS IN AG TECH AND THEY'RE CLOSE TO HOME IN ADDITION WE WILL CONTINUE TO COLLABORATE WITH EMPLOYERS EAGER TO SHARPEN THEIR EXISTING WORKERS ABILITIES TO THRIVE IN THIS RAPIDLY CHANGING INDUSTRY. DOING THESE THINGS WELL AND MAKING THEM ON A LARGE SCALE ACROSS CALIFORNIA WILL REQUIRE INVESTMENT. THE L. SO. WHAT I'M HERE TO SAY IS A I'M HERE ASKING THE SAME THING THAT MY GREAT GRANDFATHER DID FROM THAT AIRPLANE PILOT AND IF YOU GUYS CAN REALLY LOOK AT THIS AND HELP US OUT IDENTIFY SOME OF THOSE LOST FUNDS THANK YOU. FOR ANY QUESTIONS MEMBERS- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION I'M A BIG COMMUNITY COLLEGE ADVOCATE THEM HIGH SCHOOL- AGRICULTURAL CLASS BECAUSE I'M SO I ADMIRE WHAT YOU'RE DOING IT HARD NOW- KILL OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGES TAP INTO YOUR CLASSES- FOR THE CLASSES ONLINE- IN OTHER COLLEGES COLLABORATING BECAUSE THIS THIS IS NOT A ONE THIS IS ALMOST NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL BUT- A LOT OF THE AG TECHNOLOGY IS KIND OF ONE SIZE- SO CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME IDEAS WHAT YOU MIGHT BE DOING WITH OTHER COLLEGES IN MY RURAL. COLLEGES I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY'RE DOING THIS AND SO SHAME ON ME I WILL FIND OUT BUT- DIFFERENCE THERE THERE'S COLLABORATION VAULT AND THAT YOU ARE BRINGING DRY DÍAS TOGETHER BE ABLE TO DO AYE I KNOW SOME OF THESE CLASSES COULD BE ONLINE THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE ON THE FIELD SO. ARE YOU WILING TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION IT YES- SO. CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES A PRETTY SMALL NETWORK- AND SO WE WORK. REALLY CLOSELY TOGETHER SO DENNIS WAS DISCUSSING. KIND OF THAT COLLABORATIVE OF REALLY KIND OF LOOKING AT NORTH SOUTH THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND SALINAS. HAS KIND OF THAT APPROACH IN THOSE THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED MULTIPLE TIMES- A LOT OF US GET TOGETHER WORK ON THAT WE WORK ON. ESPECIALLY YOU KNOW ONE OF THE DOWNSIDES WHEN THE HARD. REALITIES OF. IT UP WITH GRANTS RURAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE. YOU JUST CAN'T HIT THE NUMBERS THAT A LOT OF URBAN COLLEGES CAN HIT WHEN YOU'RE APPLYING FOR A GRANT. SO THE ONLY WAY WE CAN REALLY BE COMPETITIVE. IS BY WORKING TOGETHER ACROSS TO. YOU KNOW HE DIFFERENT LINES ARE COMPANIES. ARE THROUGHOUT OUR STATE SO ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE ALL KNOW IS WE'VE GOT TO WORK TOGETHER NO NO ONE WILL SEE HERE- IN MY DISTRICT. I'M ONLY GOING TO BE DOING THIS ON MY DISTRICT I WOULD HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER- STATEWIDE THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS AND SO LIKE- I JUST FINISHED WITH A- NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION- GRANT WHERE WE TOOK. ALL OF OUR FOOD SAFETY CLASSES. AND STE- PUT THOSE IN A CANVAS CARTRIDGE SO YES THEY'RE ONLINE. AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE USING A SOFTWARE CALLED CAMPUS. AND SO THEY- THEY CAN ACTUALLY JUST DOWNLOAD IT AND UPLOAD RIGHT INTO THEIR THEIR THEIR CLASSES. SO THE ONLY TO RUN THAT THROUGH THEIR ACADEMIC SENATES IN THOSE KIND OF THINGS. WE ALSO TAKE THAT SAME INFORMATION AND NOW THAT CAN BE INTEGRATED RIGHT INTO THOSE HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULA. BUT A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING AND WE KIND OF TOUCHED ON IT EARLIER YES. WE CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THAT STUDENT. GRADUATES HIGH SCHOOL. TO START THINKING ABOUT SOME OF THESE AREAS- AND AGAIN MANY OF OUR HIGH SCHOOL INSTRUCTORS. THEY'RE TEACHING LIKE TWELVE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES WITHIN AGRICULTURE RIGHT SO WE'VE GOT TO GIVE THEM THOSE TOOLS THAT THEY CAN PULL OUT OF THE BOX AND USE RIGHT IN THE CLASSROOMS SO- WE USE ONLINE IT'S A GREAT STRATEGY- THERE CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE NEED OUR HANDS ON- BUT BUT AS A WHOLE WE'RE TRYING TO USE ALL THE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES. SO WE REMEMBER THE FEW MEMBERS THAT ARE HERE IS THE I THINK WE SHOULD- MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THE FUNDING TO THE PARTICULAR THIS HIGH SCHOOL AGRICULTURAL TECHNICAL- EDUCATION CLASSES BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN THIS IS WHERE WE CAN GET SOME OF THOSE KIDS TO GET. LOST IN THE SHUFFLE AND ONE TEACHER IN A SMALL COMMUNITY THE ONLY A ONE ACT TEACHER THERE'S NO ONE ELSE TO DO IT AND THEN IT JUST TAKES THE BASICS AND NOT SOME IS TECHNOLOGY THAT WE NEED. OUT IN THE FIELD SO- I THINK WE NEED TO REALLY RELATE THIS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THE FUNDING TO SUPPORT TECHNICAL- SO TECHNICAL SUPPORT IN THOSE HIGH SCHOOLS. EIGHT EXACT AND SEEING THAT THE SHOPS ON THAT SIDE OF IT STAY OPEN WEEK WE SEE PROGRAMS BUT NOW THEY HAVE. AN AG TEACHER BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME TYPES OF THINGS THAT I WENT THROUGH WHEN THERE WAS A ROBUST. HIGH SCHOOL PROGRAMS OUT THERE. MYSTERIES AND I APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION THE COMMENTS AND- YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO REPRESENT THE SALINAS VALLEY- AND YOU KNOW HAVING A FIRST HAND UNDERSTANDING OF THE INCREDIBLE SUCCESS THAT HARD NOW. I HAS HAD- WITH THEIR AG PROGRAMS- A LOT OF THAT WOULD BE POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE SUPPORT FROM THE INDUSTRY INDUSTRIES PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN MAKING THIS POSSIBLE I AND SO IF YOU COULD SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TOO I THINK YOU ALLUDED TO IT IN YOUR COMMENTS BUT YOU SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TO THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING THAT PARTNERSHIP. AND IT REALLY IS A MODEL FOR OTHER AGRICULTURAL REGIONS ACROSS THE STATE LEVERAGING OUR JUNIOR COLLEGE SYSTEM TO MAKE THIS POSSIBLE TELL IT'S I'M I HAVE GOOSE BUMPS JUST BECAUSE I'M THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW I MEAN. THEIR KIDS WHAT WHAT THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY'S DID. INSULIN IS EXTREMELY RARE THROUGHOUT THE NATION YOU SEE IT AT LAND GRANT UNIVERSITIES BUT- I HAVEN'T BAG STEERING I HAVE TO AG STEERING MEETINGS A YEAR. THIS IS C. LEVEL EXECUTIVES OWNERS PEOPLE WITH NAMES ON THE BUILDING. WE CAN LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE IT'S A LOT EASIER TO HAVE A BIG COMPANY WRITE YOU A CHECK THEN HAVE SOMEONE COME IN AND SAT DOWN. AND TRULY EXPLAIN WHAT THEIR COMPANY NEEDS. VACANCY AROUND THE CORNERS THEY CAN SEE THINGS THAT FOR ME I CAN WALK THROUGH THE FACTORY A THOUSAND TIMES AND I'M NOT GOING TO SEE ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT THAT FRONT THOSE PEOPLE COMING IN THAT MAKES A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE. AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO REPLICATE IT'S AMAZING TO SEE IT IN SALINAS AND THAT WOULD BE A GREAT CHALLENGE FOR THE REST OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO TRULY BE THAT ENGAGED. THE THING THAT THEY THEY ARE ABLE TO GIVE US THAT HUGE VISIONING BELL LOT OF PLACES THAT HAVE ADVISORY COMMITTEES AND THAT'S IMPORTANT ADVISORY COMMITTEES ARE THOSE THOSE. A LOT OF TIMES AT SEA LEVEL EXECUTIVE DOESN'T NECESSARILY KNOW WHAT TYPE OF SERVO VALVE THEY'RE USING OUT IN THE IN THE PLANT. SO WE WANT THEM TO VISION AND THEN WE NEED THOSE OTHER THAT THOSE FRONT LINE MANAGERS THAT ARE REALLY GOING TO TELL US THOSE SPECIFIC SKILLS THAT WE WANT TO USE. AND AGAIN I DIDN'T CREATE THAT HARTNELL- I WAS ABLE TO COME OVER AND BE PART OF THAT. AND SO THERE THERE AND THEN BECAUSE OF THAT THAT GIVES US A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE WHEN WE'RE APPLYING FOR GRANTS. IT GIVES US ALL OF THOSE OTHER THINGS. AND THEN YES THEY SUPPORT US- AMAZING AMAZING SUPPORT. NOT ONLY WITH CHECKS. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT A LOT ABOUT INTERNSHIPS RIGHT IS. YOU TAKE AN INTERN AND YOU PUT HIM IN A IN A IN A JOB PLACE. THAT TAKES THAT EXCELLENT EMPLOYEE AND MAKE SOME ABOUT HALF AS EFFICIENT AS THEY WERE BEFORE. BUT IF YOU DO THAT LONG ENOUGH AND WE CAN SCALE IT MORE AND MORE PEOPLE WE CAN GET THEM OUT THERE AND AGAIN THIS IS THIS IS INDUSTRY LEADERS THAT ARE TRULY LOOKING AT THE LONG RUN SORRY. I LOVE MY INDUSTRY SERVICE FOR SURE. THROUGH THE MEMBERS SEE NO OTHER QUESTIONS- DEAN THANK YOU VERY INSPIRING THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO HEAR AND HEAR EVERYTHING YOU MENTIONED TODAY. THANK YOU SIR. WELL I WANT TO WELCOME. THE PARTICIPANTS IN OUR SECOND PANEL MADE UP OF AGTECH PETITIONERS WHO WILL GIVE US SOME INSIGHT INTO THE WORLD AG TECHNOLOGY CURRENTLY BEING DEVELOPED IN USE IN THE FIELD. OUR FIRST PRESENTER IS DON CAMERON VICE PRESIDENT AND GENERAL MANAGER OF AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN VIA PADILLA AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND GUESTS TODAY. BOB MY NAME IS DON CAMERON AND I MANAGE TERRANOVA RANCH WHICH- AS YOU'VE SEEN FROM MY RESUME I'M A FARMER AND FARM OVER TWENTY FIVE DIFFERENT CROPS. INCLUDING ORGANIC IN FRESNO COUNTY- IN THE CENTER OF THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. YOU KNOW AGRICULTURE IS CHANGING AND CHANGING RAPIDLY. NOT JUST GROWING DIFFERENT CROPS. MOORE SAYS- MORE SUSTAINABLE WAYS BUT FARMING AND A NEW AND DIFFERENT WAY WITH WITH TECHNOLOGY. CAN WERE E EVER BRINGING THIS TECHNOLOGY ON FARM AT A RAPID PACE. WE'RE ALSO LOOKING TO BRING IN A NEW GENERATION OF WORKERS- ONES THAT COME WITH THE EXPERTISE IN ROBOTICS. TECHNOLOGY INFORMATION AND IMPLEMENTATION M. AND UNDERSTANDING OF NEW AND INNOVATIVE WAYS. IN FARMING WE NEED TO MEASURE TRACK AND REPORT EVERY ASPECT OF OUR FARM OPERATION. NOT NOT ONLY FOR REGULATORY COMPLIANCE BUT FOR FINDING ETTER WAYS TO USE OUR PRECIOUS NATURAL RESOURCES WHILE PRODUCING FRESH HEALTHY FOOD FOR CALIFORNIA IN THE NATION IN THE WORLD. WE NEED HIGHLY TRAINED EMPLOYEES ON FARM WITH NEW SKILLS. WELL SOME OF THE THINGS WE ARE DOING ON FARM JUST TO SHOW YOU SOME OF THE MECHANIZATION. YEAH WE'RE USING AUTOMATED IRRIGATION SYSTEMS- WERE USING MECHANICAL PEPPER HARVESTING- ELECTRONIC SORTERS AND IMPLEMENTATION HONOR TO MIDDLE HARVESTERS BUT WE'RE ALSO WE'RE ALSO TRYING GLAZER WEEDERS CARE FIELD TO SEE IF WE CAN ACTUALLY CONTROL WEEDS WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY. WE'RE FOR ACTUALLY- FOR ELIMINATING A LOT OF THE HAND HARVEST WHEREVER POSSIBLE. WE'RE WORKING WITH A GROUP OF POSTDOCS STUDENTS THAT HAVE A START UP FROM STANFORD THAT ARE PRODUCING NITROGEN FERTILIZER FROM THE ATMOSPHERE- USING SOLAR POWER. SO L. WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL DIFFERENT WAYS TO BRING TECHNOLOGY ON FARM- WERE WORKING WITH THE COMPANY RIGHT NOW TO- AS WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD WE KNOW THAT ELECTRIC TRACTORS OF SOME- IN OUR IN OUR FUTURE. AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THE POSSIBILITY OF STORING LOW PRICED ELECTRICITY. USING THE TRACTORS AND THEN PUSHING THE POWER BACK INTO THE GRID WHEN PRICES ARE HIGH SO THAT WE CAN SUPPLY POWER TO THE GRID AND REDUCE OUR COSTS. SO WE HAVE A LOT OF TECHNOLOGY- COMING SOME COLLECTIVELY YOU HEARD EARLIER WE HAVEN'T EVEN DISCOVERED YET. BUT CURRENTLY. WHEN ONE OF OUR TRACTORS HAS A PROBLEM WHAT WE DO IT GETS CONNECTED TO A COMPUTER FOR DIAGNOSIS OF THE PROBLEM. YEAH WHEN WE VIEW AERIAL PHOTOS OF OUR CROPS FOR MOISTURE STRESS. YOU KNOW WHO'S GOING TO DO THE INTERPRETATION AND THE IMPLEMENTATION TO PUT THAT DATA INTO ACTION. ONE REASON WOULD DO RECEIVE DATA FROM OUR TECHNOLOGY PROVIDERS WHO'S GONNA BE DOING THE ANALYSIS. YOU KNOW. ON FARM ROBOTICS WHO'S GOING TO BE DOING THE OPERATION THE MAINTENANCE AND THE REPAIRS. HELP WHEN WE DO USE LASER WEEDERS WHO'S GOING TO PROGRAM AND MONITOR AND MAKE THE NECESSARY ADJUSTMENTS. SO THE WE ONLY KILL THE WEEDS AND NOT OUR CROPS. WE HAVE CIGNA COMPLIANCE SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT. WHO'S GOING TO BE COLLECTING THE DATA AND WHO'S GOING TO BE INTERPRETING THAT DATA. AND MONITORING OUR WATER USAGE. AND AS I SAID WHO'S GONNA BE RUNNING OUR AUTOMATED IRRIGATION SYSTEM SO THAT WE CAN BE MORE PRECISE WITH THE WATER THAT WE DO HAVE. THIS ISN'T ABOUT REPLACING OUR CURRENT FARM WORKFORCE. BECAUSE WE VITALLY NEED THEM. BUT WE DO NEED TO TRAIN THOSE THAT ARE WILLING. TO ENTER INTO SOME OF THESE NEWER HIGHER PAYING JOBS- SO THAT THEY CAN ADVANCE WITHIN OUR WITHIN OUR FARM. HELLO THIS IS ABOUT GIVING LOCAL TALENT YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN MANY SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF FOUR FOUR OF CURRENT FARMWORKERS THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO OBTAIN THE HIGH PAYING CAREERS IN AGRICULTURE. THIS IS ABOUT LONG TERM CHANGE IT'S ABOUT REPLACING THE HUDDLE WITH LAYS WITH LASERS. REPLACING HAND HARVEST WITH ROBOTICS IT'S ABOUT AUTOMATING THE FARM AND IT'S ABOUT PRECISION FARMING. IT'S ABOUT USING TECHNOLOGIES TO PROVIDE HEALTHIER SAFER WELL PAYING LONG TERM CAREERS IN AGRICULTURE. WE NEED TO MAKE JOBS IN AGRICULTURE ATTRACTIVE. THE ADAGE HAD BEEN IN THE PAST YOU KNOW LONG HOURS LOW PAY. THAT HAVE TYPIFIED AGRICULTURE- MANY YEARS AGO THIS SCENARIOS CHANGED. AND THE IMAGE OF AGRICULTURE NEEDS TO CHANGE AS WELL. YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN SAID BEFORE BUT WE NEED TO MAKE ACCURATE AGRICULTURE ATTRACTIVE OR AT LEAST EXCITING CHALLENGING AND REWARDING. WE NEED TO ATTRACT YOUNG LOCAL TALENT FOR OUR FARMS FOR CAREERS. THIS IS REALLY A TREMENDOUS NEED FOR LOCAL THERE'S JUST A TREMENDOUS NEED FOR LOCAL STUDENTS FROM OUR COMMUNITIES TO FILL THESE NEEDS IN THE SILICON VALLEY AND REALLY THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE PH DIS OR PEOPLE WITH FOUR YEAR DEGREES. FOR SOMEONE WHO'S REYES BEEN RAISED ON A FARM. WE NEED TALENT THAT'S CAPABLE OF LEARNING AND ADAPTING CRUNCHING NUMBERS WORKING OPERATING. MAINTAINING NEW TECHNOLOGY ON FARM. WE FOUND THAT HIRING LOCAL HELP THE COMMUNITY IT HELPS THE STUDENTS AND IT HELPS THEIR FAMILY IMPROVE THEIR LIVES WHILE PROVIDING ROLE MODELS FOR OTHERS IN THE COMMUNITY TO SUCCEED. WE WANT TO KEEP THE STUDENTS HERE TO REMAIN IN THE REGION WHERE THEY GREW UP. WHILE THE BALK PROVIDING LEADERSHIP FOR OTHERS DEVELOPMENT WE DESPERATELY IN ADDITION TO THE STATE DEVELOPMENT WE DESPERATELY NEED RURAL BROADBAND- TO CONNECT OUR FARM. YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN BILLS PASSED WE HAVE MONEY THAT IS BEING PUT FORWARD TO THE BROADBAND ISSUE IN RURAL CALIFORNIA. BUT YOU KNOW SOMETIMES YOU KNOW. IT IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT WHEN WE'RE USING INTERNET SPEEDS OF SEVEN MEGABITS PER SECOND OR LESS. TO TRY AND DOWNLOAD TECHNOLOGY PHOTOS OF OUR OF OUR CROP STRESS EVEN MORE TRYING AND MORE DIFFICULT FOR STUDENTS TRYING TO RECEIVE THEIR EDUCATION IN RURAL CALIFORNIA. NO WE WE'VE HAD SOME BY SOME OF OUR WORKERS HAVE HAD TO USE A CELL PHONE. TO TETHER THREE TABLETS TO THEIR CELL PHONE TO GET THEIR KIDS EDUCATION AND I GUARANTEE OF THAT DOESN'T WORK. HELP MY LAST MY LAST PRICE PRICE QUOTE FOR BRINGING. TRUE BROADBAND ON FARM TWENTY DOWN WHICH IS HARDLY HIGH SPEED INTERNET. ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. AND AS YOU CAN TELL WE DIDN'T GO THAT WAY. YEAH I WAS UP THERE OUTRAGEOUS. WE NEED COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO BE PART OF OUR SOLUTION. WE NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THEM TO DO IT TO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP THE STAFF PROVIDE THE PROGRAMS AND PROVIDE THE HANDS ON TRAINING TO TEACH THE SKILLS OF THE FUTURE. WE NEED THE INSTRUCTORS TO COMMUNICATE AND PARTNER WITH TECHNOLOGY PROVIDERS. AND LOCAL FARMS FOR PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS. SO THAT THEIR CURRICULUM REFLECTS THE LATEST INFORMATION AND THE NEEDS OF THE AG INDUSTRY. A YEAR AND A HALF AGO. WE HIRED A STUDENT FROM WEST HILLS COMMUNITY COLLEGE. WHO LIVES IN A VERY DISADVANTAGED RURAL COMMUNITY OF FARMWORKERS WE HAVE AN INTERN PROGRAM PROGRAM ON OUR FARMING OPERATION. SHE'S CONTINUING HER EDUCATION. WELL WHILE WORKING WITH THE EXPECTATION OF BECOMING A FULL TIME EMPLOYEE AND MAKING FINANCIALLY REWARDING CAREERS IN AGRICULTURE. I PERSONALLY SEEING THE CHANGES THAT HER ATTITUDE FOR PERSONAL GROWTH HER PRIDE OF WORK AND MORE IMPORTANTLY HER SELF CONFIDENCE AND SELF ESTEEM SINCE JOINING OUR TEAM. EGGER CULTURE NEEDS DEDICATED PROGRAMS IN OUR HIGH SCHOOLS. ESPECIALLY OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES- THAT PIQUES THE INTEREST OF STUDENTS AND WANT THEM TO MAKE A CAREER IN AGRICULTURE. WITH OVER THREE HUNDRED DIFFERENT JOBS IN AGRICULTURE AVAILABLE OUR ROLE COMMUNITIES AND FARMS NEED YOUR SUPPORT. WE NEED THE BEST EDUCATION THAT MONEY CAN BUY FOR A ROLE CULTURAL KIRK'S PERFECT CULTURALLY DIVERSE. ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS SO PLEASE DON'T LEAVE THEM IN A BEHIND. YOU KNOW WHY NOT PROVIDE ECONOMIC INCENTIVES TO STUDENTS WHO PURSUE A CAREER IN AGRICULTURE. AS MANY TIMES THEY MUST WORK TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE FAMILIES ECONOMIC NEEDS. EGGER CULTURE NEEDS YOUR HELP OUR COMMUNITIES NEED YOUR HELP. WE NEED HELP IN ADDING TO THE WORKFORCE WITH HIGHLY TECHNICAL INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE THE SKILLS FOR JOBS THAT HAVEN'T YET BEEN CREATED. SO I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT BEFORE YOU TODAY AND- WOULD LOVE TO HEAR SOME QUESTIONS ABSOLUTELY. SECRETARY WELL YOU SHOULD HAVE HAD TO COME SPEAK ON THE FLOOR ABOUT BROADBAND INTERNET HOLLYWOOD FORTY YEARS AGO BECAUSE I'VE BEEN PREACHING TO THE CHOIR IN THIS BUILDING FOR YEARS WE FINALLY GOT THE BILL THROUGH BUT LIKE ANYTHING IT TAKES TIME TO IMPLEMENT BUT WE'RE WE'RE DOING IT SO. BUT YOU KNOW- I WAS TALKED EARLIER ABOUT ONE OF THE CLIENTS I WENT OUT TO CONSTITUENTS YESTERDAY CUSTOM FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO GET IN INTERNET FROM TO HIS BUSINESS AND BREAKS MY HEART THAT HE HAD TO GO DO THAT AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE ABLE TO. DO SOME KIND OF INCENTIVES FOR SOME OF THE- OTHER POINT THAT YOU BROUGHT UP THAT I THINK THAT WE pAGING WORKFORCE. THEIR WORK FORCES OUT IN THE FIELDS RIGHT NOW THEY'RE NOT AS MANY BUT THE WORK FORCE'S OLDER. AND THEN WE DO NEED TO BACK FILL WITH SOME. TECHNOLOGY AND STUDENTS AND- PEOPLE THAT UNDERSTAND THAT AGRICULTURE IS A REALLY GOOD VIBRANT JOB. AND FOR ME I'VE OWNED A FARM WITH MY BROTHERS AND THERE'S NOTHING BETTER THAN THE FRESH AIR. TO BE OUTSIDE THE TOUCH THE DIRTAND PLANT SOMETHING AND WATCH IT GROW I MEAN I HAVE THIS WHOLE DIFFERENT FEELING THAT MAYBE SOME PEOPLE DO. ONE OF THE THINGS I'M LOOKING AT HIM I. WOULD LOVE TO HAVE. YOUR COMMENTS AND I THINK THE NEXT THREE. IS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF FAMILY FARMS THAT ARE PRETTY LARGE. AND THEIR SISTER THEY WERE HOPING TO PASS IT DOWN TO THE FAMILY. AND THEIR CHILDREN. QUITE APART NECESSARY INTERESTED. AND THEY DON'T WANT TO LOSE IT SO YOU KNOW AS WE GET OLDER WE WANT TO HOLD ON TO OUR LAND- LOOKING AT MAYBE- DOING. SMALLER FARMS PLUS. AND MAYBE GIVING THE A FARMER OF THE MAIN PROPERTY- OWNER A TAX CREDIT. TO MAYBE DO A LEASE FOR MAYBE THIRTY OR FORTY ACRES ON THEIR PROPERTY. I'M TRYING TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO LOSE MY FARMS. AND I DON'T WANT TO ALL TO BE SOLD TO CORPORATIONS BUT I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THAT YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT. YOU KNOW WEEK WE PROBABLY SEE MORE FARMS FOR SALE. LARGE LARGER FAMILY FARMS FOR SALE THAT I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFETIME. THERE IS A THERE'S A JEFF DEFINITE GENERATIONAL CHANGE HAPPENING. THAT COUPLED WITH- I THINK A LOT OF THE FARMERS HAVE JUST- HAD ENOUGH OF THE REGULATIONS- IT'S TOUGH FARMING IN CALIFORNIA MORE SO THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN THE UNION. I THINK WE HAVE TO BE CREATIVE. WE WANT TO KEEP THE LAND AND PRODUCTION AS WELL AS WE CAN AS YOU KNOW THE WATER ISSUES IN CALIFORNIA ARE TREMENDOUS. ASHLEY DOWN AND IN OUR REGION- WERE WERE IN A CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASIN. SO I WOULD THINK ANY OPPORTUNITY TO KEEP THE FARM. IN PRODUCTION. IF IT IF IT MEANS SPLITTING IT UP LEASING GROUND- TO OTHER FARMERS GIVING THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO FARM I THINK FANTASTIC. WE GET IT IS A DIFFICULT CHALLENGE IT'S HUGE CHALLENGE ROOM BECAUSE THE PRICE OF EQUIPMENT COMPUTERS THE NEW WATER YOUR ATTENTION SYSTEMS BUT I LOOK AT- A GROUP THAT'S HERE NOR THE CALIFORNIA CENTER FOR BLAND BUT BIT PLAN BASED LEARNING AND THEY'RE TEACHING PEOPLE TO BE FARMERS EXACTLY AND THEY'RE GONNA BE FAR IN BUT THEY CAN'T AFFORD THE LAND THEY CAN'T GET THE FINANCING IN THE YOU KNOW. SO I'M JUST TRYING TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX IS HOW CAN WE KEEP THE LAND THE LAND THAT I LOVE IN MANY LOVE. AND KEEP IT VIABLE THING MAKE SURE X. THREE MEANS OF PRODUCTION SO YOU KNOW WHAT I IF YOU HAVE ANYWHERE IN THE NATION THIS DOING SOMETHING CREATIVE OR I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR THAT BUT- ONE OF MY GOOD FRIENDS RICHARD ROMINGER WHO RECENTLY PASSED AWAY WAS A VERY I ADAM AND WORKED WITH ME IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE COULD DO THAT. AND SO- I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY KIND OF INPUT THE MOVE YOU OR OTHERS MIGHT BE ABLE TO GIVE US NO I AGREE THAT RICHARD WAS A FRIEND OF MINE AS WELL YEAH. VERY WONDERFUL PERSON AND I AM NOT UNBELIEVABLE AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE IN THE AND WISDOM. YEAH BUT- I SEE THERE ARE YOU KNOW TO GET INTO FARMING DON'T AS YOU SAID YOU. HAVE TO THE LAND. YOU CAN LEASE LAND. AND THERE'S IN SECURITY WITH THAT. BUT IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT MATCH UP. I THINK I THINK IT'S A VIABLE OPTION IT'S A GOOD WAY TO GET PEOPLE INVOLVED IN IT IN IN FARMING- IACTUALLY HAD NO FORM BACKGROUND- BEFORE I GOT INVOLVED IN AGRICULTURE. AT IT AS YOU SAY THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT BEING OUT THERE PLANTING SEEDS WATCHING THINGS GROW PRODUCING CROPS THAT REALLY THAT FEED THE WORLD AND- IT'S VERY SATISFYING. AND I WOULDN'T TRADE IT FOR ANYTHING YEAH THAT BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN TO SOME. LET'S FACE IT TO A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT. OR TO SOMEONE- EARLY IN THEIR COLLEGE CAREER- BUT I THINK WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF. OF BRINGING PEOPLE INTO AGRICULTURE. I SEE. AND I THINK THAT WE TALKED ABOUT THE COMMONALITY I THINK THAT THOSE WHO LIVE IN A FARM ENVIRONMENT. TEND TO TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THEY DON'T LOOK AT IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY AS A CAREER PATH- I THINK THAT IF THEY LOOK BEYOND THAT. AND SOMEHOW WE NEED TO MAKE THE CHANGE WE NEED TO SHOW THEM THAT- THAT IT CAN BE EXCITING AND IT CAN BE REALLY REALLY REWARDING AND A GREAT PLACE TO WORK IN A LOT OF. IT IS A CHALLENGE I WOULD REMEMBER NINE CHANGE NO DOUBT ABOUT IT THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. YEAH RICH WAS VERY DIFFERENT WHEN TO. DISTRIBUTE THANK YOU I WOULD JUST LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT ON- YOU KNOW I SHARED EARLIER THAT I'VE VISITED ABOUT ELEVEN FIVE OF ELEVEN I'VE BEEN ON ELEVEN TEARS- TO TWO DIFFERENT FARMS AND- YOU KNOW I HEAR THE SAME THINGS OVER AND OVER AGAIN HOW ABOUT HOW DIFFICULT IT IS BUT- YET WHEN I SPEAK TO YOU AND TO. THOSE OF YOU IN THE INDUSTRY YOUR EYES LIGHT UP WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU DO AND SO I THINK PART OF THE MESSAGE IS NOT GETTING ACROSS TO THE YOUNGER GENERATIONS. ABOUT HOW REWARDING IT IS AND SOLD AT YOU KNOW I DON'T CLAIM TO HAVE A SOLUTION TO THAT OBVIOUSLY BUT- I THINK YOU KNOW WILL THE- ADVANTAGES OF WHAT YOU DO SHOULD BE HIGHLIGHTED- MORE OFTEN AND- NOT JUST ADVANTAGES ABOUT ABOUT HOW YOU MIGHT HOW MUCH YOU ENJOY IN THAT WE DO FEED. YOU KNOW THE REST OF THE COUNTRY THAT'S REALLY SOMETHING IMPORTANT AND CRITICAL IF YOU KNOW A WHOLE BUNCH WAS GIVEN TO. POLITICS MAINLY TO HELP SOMEBODY RIGHT AND BUT YOU DO THIS AND YOU HELP OF THE DEVIL CALIFORNIA AND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY SO MAYBE SOME MARKETING WILL WOULD HELP. YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY I'M FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MAYBE YOU KNOW PREACHING TO THE CHOIR YOU'VE ALREADY DONE IT BUT I SEE IT A LOT WHEN I WAS A TEACHER. WE WOULD DO WITH THE YOU KNOW BRING THE COW- TO THE TO OUR CLASSROOM AND THAT YOU KNOW THE KIDS GOT TO EXPERIENCE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOU KNOW MILKING THE COW I GET THE OUR FRESH FOOD OF THE MONTH. KIND OF PROGRAM THAT WAS AVAILABLE TO ME DOWN AND SEVEN CALIFORNIA AND THAT WAS THE EXTENT OF KIND OF FARMING AND TALKING ABOUT GOD YOU KNOW PRODUCE AND WHERE IT COMES FROM. AND THAT'S SO TINY I MEAN THE KIDS WERE JUST MORE INTERESTED IN THE YOU KNOW IN THE TASTING THE FOOD NOT NECESSARILY AND WHERE IT CAME FROM- AND THEY THEY WE EXPLAIN THAT RIGHT BUT- IT WAS TOO ASSEMBLY WOMAN- I GEHRY CURRY'S POINT. THERE'S NOT ENOUGH- POSITIVE ADVERTISING OR POSITIVE- COMMUNICATION WITH STUDENTS THAT MAY BE IN YOU KNOW ARE. INTERESTED AND DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT I KNOW. THAT'S NOT THE POINT OF THEM THE WANTED TO SHARE THAT BECAUSE MY PURSE. AS A- AS A TEACHER IS THE IT'S JUST SOMETHING TO SOMEBODY DOES AS OPPOSED TO SOME BUT SOMETHING THAT. WE CAN DEAL WITH CELL. WANT TO SHARE THAT. NO I AGREE COMPLETELY WITH YOU WE ARE VERY TRANSPARENT IN OUR FARMING OPERATION- WE HOST. A LOT OF GROUPS A LOT OF STUDENTS. FROM UC DAVIS FROM FRESNO STATE. FROM WEST HILLS COMMUNITY COLLEGE- REBATE WE POSTED- OVER MANY YEARS GROUPS FROM- CHIPPING GO UNIVERSITY IN MEXICO- THEY COME UP THEY THEY ALWAYS STOP AT OUR LOCATION WE GIVE THEM WE USUALLY SPEND A FULL DAY WITH THEIR GROUP THEY MAY HAVE TWO BUSES- WE HOST THE AG LEADERSHIP GROUP- THE NEW FELT SCHOLARS OUT ABOUT PRIMARILY IN AUSTRALIA THEY'RE NOW EXPANDING THROUGHOUT THE NOT ONLY THE US BUT THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THAT WE HOST THEM EVERY YEAR- AND WHAT WE MAKE OURSELVES AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS ANY STUDENT THAT WANTS TO BE INVOLVED WE BRING THEM ON FARM AND WE DO HAVE A PROGRAM. OF INTERNSHIP PROGRAM TO WHERE WE WILL. SPEND THE TIME AND WILL EDUCATE THEM. AND YOU DON'T WE FOUND THAT THE VALUE IN THAT HAS BEEN IMMENSE YOU KNOW THE TWO PEOPLE WE'VE HAD SO FAR. I THINK REMAIN WITH US FOR A LONG TIME. THE HELP. THANK YOU- I JUST LIKE TO ECHO WHAT MY COLLEAGUES WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT I MEAN. ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO NEW FARMERS. WE HEAR I HEAR A LOT OF FUNDING FOR FROM THE FEDS FOR VETERANS. BUT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW HOW CAN WE GET THAT INFORMATION TO NEW FARMERS AND THE QUESTION THE REALLY HOT THAT I WANTED ASKING IS PROBABLY ADDRESS TO YOUR CLIENT. ARE THERE ARE THERE OPPORTUNITIES IS TO TEACH TRAIN AND USE AG. TECH IN URBAN SETTINGS. SOME OF IT I THINK YOU CAN I MEAN I I'M ALWAYS SUPPORTIVE OF URBAN FARMS- SMALL FARMS REALLY ALL OF AGRICULTURE- BECAUSE I THINK ONCE YOU GET STARTED I THINK YOU GET HOOKED. AND YOU MAY START IN A SMALL URBAN SETTING. AND YOU MAY LIKE IT SO MUCH THAT YOU MAY EXPAND TO THE ALPS OUTSKIRTS OF THE OF THE COMMUNITY. CAN START SOMETHING A LITTLE LARGER. AND I THINK THERE'S ANOTHER A REAL EVOLUTION THAT TAKES PLACE. HOW YOU GET I MEAN I GUESS HOW DO YOU BRING THE PEOPLE TO. THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE- YOU KNOW I THINK PART OF IT'S THEIR INTERESTS AND THE GOVERNMENT TO TRY SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND- YOU KNOW THE ACTUAL HANDS ON BOOTS ON THE GROUND. YOU REALLY NEED THE EXPERIENCE YOU NEED TO YOU NEED TO. WE NEED TO WANT TO DO IT I GUESS SANTA. AND I THINK THERE ARE LOCATIONS YOU KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THE- CENTER DAVIS THAT- HAS TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR- FOR BOTH STUDENTS TO WANT TO GET INVOLVEDIN AGRICULTURE THEY CAN BE TRAINED THEIR THEIR PROGRAM HE ALSO IS IN THE- SILICON VALLEY THEY HAVE- THE CAN WORKING AND IN. OUR REGION AS WELL SO. WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE POSSIBLE WAYS TO GET IN- BUT AS I SAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO OWN THE LAND YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE NEW EQUIPMENT- THERE THERE'S WAYS YOU CAN DO IT WE OFFER THAT THAT THAT'S- PRETTY MUCH I GOT STARTED HERE. BOB WELL I WAS WE HAVE A TEACHER WHO. I'M NOT ALWAYS HERE I'M ALWAYS LISTENING TO HER- BECAUSE SHE HER HER ASPECTS OF AS A TEACHER- BUT STE I DON'T KNOW IF THE STATE SOMETIMES ARE NOT DOING ENOUGH. RIGHT WHEN IT COMES TO EARLY. I MEAN WHAT YOU'RE WHAT WE'RE ALWAYS TAUGHT THAT THIRD GRADE FOURTH GRADE IS WHEN. PEOPLE ARE ALREADY MAKING THE DECISION WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. I WE ONLY HAVE AG FAST ONCE A YEAR THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. YEAH WE SHOULD BE DOING MORE WE SHOULD JUST IT SHOULDN'T BE A- A FIELD TRIP ONCE A YEAR IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT IT'S IN OUR CURRICULUM. IN OUR SCHOOLS. IS THAT THEY ARE TAUGHT EARLY ON. RIGHT WE ANOTHER FOUR H. PROGRAMS RIGHT ARE ALWAYS IN NEED OF FUNDING RIGHT AT THE AT THE- SOME OF THE LOWER LEVELS- FFA THE THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES. BUT BUT THERE HAS TO BE FUNDING FOR THEM AND- MADE IT SOUND LIKE A BROKEN RECORD I'M SURE YOU HEAR ALL THE TIME. THE THING OF THE FIGHT FOR THE MONEY I MEAN. IT'S A GREAT TIME RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THERE IS. A BUDGET SURPLUS AND WE KNOW GOING INTO THIS NEXT YEAR THERE'S GOING TO BE ADDITIONAL- SURPLUS AVAILABLE TO INVEST. SOME OF THAT MONEY. INTO PROGRAMS THAT WILL EXPOSE. YOUNG CHILDREN. AND JUNIOR HIGH AND HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL OF STUDENTS. TO AGRICULTURE MAYBE IN A LITTLE DIFFERENT WAY. THAN IT'S BEEN BEFORE. WITH A SPIN ON TECHNOLOGY. BECAUSE I GUARANTEE OF THE THEY KNOW THEY KNOW TECHNOLOGY THE COMPLETE COMPUTER GAMES LIKE THE GOING OUT OF STYLE YEAH- AND HOW DO WE GET THAT EXPERTISE INTO AGRICULTURE THEY'RE GOOD AT THAT BIG THEY CAN HANDLE. A LOT OF THE MORE THE MORE MALPRACTICE TO THE COULD PROBABLY PICK OUR TECHNOLOGY UP VERY RAPIDLY. I AGREE WITH YOU- I JUST HAVE ONE COMMENT YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD FOR ME WE HAVE NOT FUNDED FOR H. FOR YEARS LIKE THAT MINIMALLY AND WE LOST OUR EXTENSION PEOPLE THAT WERE OUT THERE COORDINATING ALL OF THAT FOR EIGHT YEARS AND FUNDING NEEDS TO GO BACK TO THAT PROGRAM WHETHER IN A RURAL AREA BUT IT URBAN AREA THESE KIDS COULD LEARN FROM THE TECHNOLOGY TWO FOUR H. ONLINE. YOU KNOW WITH IT WITH THE PROPER INSTRUCTIONS BUT WE DID NOT FIND THEM AND IT HAS BROKE MY HEART I THAT I CAME UP THROUGH FOR AGE IN MY VERY FIRST WORD EVERYONE WAS A FOR EACH AWARD I RAISED ANIMALS GRAND CHAMPION LAMB I DID ALL THAT STUFF THOSE KIDS DON'T GET ANYMORE. SO OKAY- OFFENBACH'S. I AGREE WITH YOU AND REALLY PLEASED. WE SAW THE UC. SYSTEM CUT DRESS. WE'RE NOW FOR GOING BACK IN. FORCING FARMING VISORS BEING HIRED WE'RE SEEING. THE OUTREACH TO NOT ONLY. TO THE MADE CROPS IN THE STATE BUT TO THE SMALL FARMERS. THE SOCIALLY DIVERSE FARMERS AND ECONOMICALLY CHALLENGED. SO WE'RE HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION- I THINK THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY MOVING FORWARD. WE DEFINITELY DID. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF MEASURE. NEXT UNFORTUNATELY PREVENT. NHTSA WILL NOT HERE TODAY WITH THIS BUT IN HIS PLACE WE WANT TO WELCOME CARLO MONDAVI FOR MAIN OFFICE AND JAKE WINTERS CHIEF OF STAFF. AT MONARCH TRACTOR. ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. WITH A STEP INTO THIS. AWESOME AS pWINTERS ON CHIEF OF STAFF AT MODERN TRACTOR BESIDE ME AS PARLIAMENT AVI ARE CO FOUNDER AND CHIEF FARMINGOFFICER- REALLY APPRECIATE YOU GUYS TAKING THE TIME TODAY I TO SET UP THIS MEETING AND FACILITATING- IT'S SUPER IMPORTANT AND A VERY PERTINENT TO THE- EVENTS. FIVE JUMPING RIGHT IN OUR HAVE A SLIGHT. THE WE'RE GONNA BE IS A FREE. HERE I FEEL FREE FALL LAW- AS WE MOVE THROUGH- MARK TRACTOR OR- TEAM OF A HUNDRED STE HI. OR SO PEOPLE DOWN IN. CAL I HAVE A NEW PROFITABLE HERE IN CALIFORNIA- AND WE PLAN TO DO THAT BY ENABLING ECONOMIC GROWTH THROUGH THE DEPLOYMENT OF SMART AND CLEAN. TECHNOLOGIES ARE PRINCIPALLY ARE ZERO EMISSION TRACTOR. WE'VE HIGHLIGHTED- THREE OF MANY CHALLENGES THAT FARMERS ARE FACING TODAY- PRINCIPALLY- LABOR SHORTAGES WHICH WE'VE DISCUSSED. HERE WITH SOME OF THE OTHER PANELISTS- BOTH FROM A ABSOLUTE SENSE IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF WORKERS AS WELL AS THE SKILL SETS. THAT ARE NEEDED NOW AND MOVING INTO THE FUTURE OF AGRICULTURE. WE'RE ALSO SEEING INCREASED SCRUTINY ON OUR FOOD ECOSYSTEM OUR- PEOPLE WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THEIR FOOD COMES FROM- WHAT KIND OF CHEMICALS AND PROCESSES ARE. DONE TO ACTUALLY PRODUCE THAT FOOD AND WHAT THE EMISSIONS IMPACT OF THAT FOOD PRODUCTION AREAS ARE ESPECIALLY. AS WE START TO. RESTAURANTS AROUND CLIMATE CHANGE AND WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO ABOUT IT. AND FOR SOME CONTACTS THERE- YEAH I'M A FORMER FIRST AND I NEVER IMAGINED MYSELF INVOLVED IN A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY BUT I'M INCREDIBLY EXCITED- MY FIRST GOAL WAS TO FIND A WAY THAT WE COULD BRIDGE AWAY FROM DANGEROUS CHEMICALS ON FARMS. I HOW CAN GET AWAY FROM HERBICIDES AND UNIQUE IT'S A NOISE TO PROTECT OUR FARM BIOLOGY ARE SOIL MICROBIOMES PROTECT ACT YOU KNOW WHAT THE BEES FROM COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER IN. THE MONARCH BUTTERFLIES ARE DISAPPEARING AND- THEN IN TWENTY FIFTEEN MY FAMILY LOST HALF OF OUR CROP DUE TO DROUGHT AT MY FAMILY'S IN THE WINE BUSINESS I. 201730% DUE TO WILDFIRE. TWENTY TWENTY A 100% OF OUR CROP DUE TO SMOKE TAINT. AND QUICKLY REALIZED THAT. IF WE DON'T PROTECT OUR CLIMATE AND THE PLANET. THAT WHO CARES ABOUT THE FATE SO I COMBINED WILL HAVE A FORM THE FORM ON. IT I QUICKLY REALIZED WE NEEDED TO WORK ON THAT- MARC IS AN ALL ELECTRIC DRIVER OPTIONAL SMART TRACTOR. BY TEEN DRIVER OPTIONAL WERE ABLE TO BRIDGE A LOT OF THE DIVIDES THAT SEPARATE CLEAN FARMING- FROM FROM CONVENTIONAL FARMING- BY BEING ELECTRIC WERE ABLE TO BRIDGE THE CARBON FOOTPRINT ASSOCIATED- AND THEN. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT THE LABOR POOL- MY BIGGEST GOAL IS TO PROTECT OUR OUR FARM TEAMS. SO RIGHT NOW. I GREW UP MY FIRST JOB AND FARMING. WAS AYE AYE MECHANIC'S ASSISTANT. AND HE WOULD ALWAYS TELL ME THE MOST DANGEROUS PLACE ON THIS FARMS THE TRACTOR SEAT. AT NOT JUST FROM POTENTIALLY IT ROLLING OVER. UT ALSO YOU HAVE T PUT ON A HAZMAT SUIT EVEN TO SPRAY ORGANIC CONTEXT REYES NOT TO MENTION THE VERY DANGEROUS CONVENTIONAL SPRAYS THAT CAN BE. QUITE THE WORST TO BREED. AND SO- BY BEING A THOMAS WERE ABLE TO PROTECT OUR FARMERS AND THAT WAY. PROTECTED FROM THE DANGERS POSITION IN THE SEAT- AND THEN ALSO- DEAL A BIT WITH THE LABOR SHORTAGE WHICH IS- NOT. BENEFICIAL YEAH OUR SERVICE CARLOS TO OUR FARMERS ARE LOOKING FOR AUTOMATION ACTUAL INSIGHTS BASED ON REAL DATA COLLECTED ON FIELD ARE AND HOW MUCH VACATION. AND SO ARE WE BUILT ON OUR TRACTOR PLATFORM I ASK OUR LOADED IT'S A FULLY ELECTRIC COMPACT TRACTOR- FORTY HORSEPOWER ARE MOSTLY SEEN. IN THE VENDOR MARKETS BUT WE DO R. I SEE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND UNITS. PRODUCED AND WE ARE HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. ARE HERE WE'VE BUILT FROM THE GROUND UP USING EXISTING COMPONENTS AND- LEVERAGING THE AUTOMOTIVE AND AGRICULTURAL SUPPLY CHAINS ARE. ALSO ADDING MANY OF THE COOL SENSORS THAT ENABLE THE DRIVER OPTIONAL. TECHNOLOGY AND SO WE HAVE ALL OF THE SAME INPUTS THAT YOU SEE ON AN EXISTING DIESEL TRACTOR. OUR FARMERS CAN GET ON AND AN OPERATOR AFTER JUST IKE THEY WITH THEIR TRADITIONAL ONE. BUT IT'S ALSO ABLE TO EXECUTE SOME OF THESE ROUTES ARE AUTONOMOUSLY AND DO SOME WORK. I WITHOUT AN OPERATOR ON BOARD. I AM BECAUSE OF THIS. TO LOOK AT SOME PRETTY SO. IMPACTS ARE TO THE FARM ARE NOT. ABOUT TWO THOUSAND. A YEAR AND A- SAVINGS AND- THREE. OF CO TWO A- ARE BEING RE. ON A TRACTOR PER YEAR START TO ADD UP TO SOME SERIOUS NUMBERS- AND QUICKLY WERE BACKED BY SOME OF THE BIGGEST NAMES IN AGRICULTURE- MR CASE NEW HOLLAND INDUSTRIAL IS ONE OF THE LARGEST AGRICULTURAL. PRODUCERS OF MACHINERY AND THE OF WORLD ARE THEY HAVE INVESTED IN MODERN TRACTOR AS WELL AS MUSASHI WHO IS A TIER ONE AUTOMOTIVE SUPPLIER. TRIMBLE WHO DOES A VARIETY OF AG TAX SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE- HAS A- A RARE SATELLITES TO BE USED FOR RTK CORRECTIONS. AND VEACH V. S. T. R. WHO DIES ARE- ONE OF THE MAIN MANUFACTURERS OF TRACTORS OUT OF INDIA. RECENTLY WE ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT CNH HAS LICENSED THE MONARCH TRACTOR TECHNOLOGY AND WILL BE APPLYING IT TO THEIR PRODUCT LINES. IN THE COMING YEAR SO WE REALLY ARE SEEING THIS TECHNOLOGY START TO I COME INTO ITS OWN AND- AND START PERSONALLY YEAH THIS IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE- YOU KNOW. OVER A QUARTER OF OUR PLANET'S CARBON FOOTPRINTS COMING FROM AGRICULTURE SO HAVING- THE SECOND LARGEST TRACTOR COMPANY IN THE WORLD LICENSE OUR TECHNOLOGY WILL HELP US MEET OUR SUSTAINABILITY GOALS. NOT JUST WITH AND MARK AS A COMPANY BUT- AS A PLANET AS WE- FIGHT TO. DEAL WITH WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH YEAH. SO WHAT WE SEE IS TECHNOLOGY IS NOT A BARRIER TO ADOPTING THIS FORMAL EDUCATION. OUR FARMERS THAT WE TALK TO THEY SAY THAT THEY NEED REGULATIONS ALIGNS WITH THE CURRENT STATE OF TECHNOLOGY WHICH WILL GONNA DIVE INTO A LITTLE BIT FURTHER HERE. ARE THEY ALSO NEED INCENTIVES TO SWAP OUT THEIR EXISTING DIESEL EQUIPMENT. FOR NEW ZERO EMISSION ONE SIDE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR A ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE ARE HIGHER ON THE OFFSET- BUT WE DO MAKE THAT MONEY BACK TO- BUT FARMING IT'S ARE. A LOW MARGIN BUSINESS AND SO IT'S DIFFERENT SOMETIMES REFORMS TO ACTUALLY MAKE THE TRANSITION. UP INCENTIVES AND WE'VE HAD GOOD SUPPORT FROM OUR OUR CARBON AND THE CC ARE THERE STARTED TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO RUN OUR ZERO EMISSION EQUIPMENT IN. THE CURRENT PLAN WORKS AND WHAT THE FRAMEWORKS OF THE FUTURE LOOK LIKE TO INCENTIVIZE THE TRANSITION- AND ADDITIONALLY FARMERS ARE ASKING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND CHARGING SUPPORT- SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY. DEPLOY THESE TECHNOLOGIES AT SCALE YEAH AND YOU KNOW THERE'S A RECENT MCKINSEY- STUDY THAT SHE- DECK BY ELECTRIFY. FARMING IT'S THE SINGLE GREATEST THING THE WE CAN DO. TO HELP- DEAL WITH THAT CARBON FIBER ON THE ON THE IMPLEMENTS. ON THE ON THE- SIDE SEES ME- ANOTHER THING THAT'S IMPORTANT IS IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAW. DECADE I FOR BEEN FORMER FOR A HUNDRED. ELASTICATED A DECADE THAT WE'VE HAD. SOME SEVERE. GIVEN EVERYTHING TO TAP KNOW THESE ARE LEGACY. INVESTMENTS THAT WE AS A FARMING COMMUNITY AND TO OUR TRACTOR EQUIPMENT AND ALL OF OUR EQUIPMENT- THEY'RE MEANT TO LAST A LONG TIME. AND SO GETTING THE SUPPORT FROM. THE GOVERNMENT TO BE ABLE TO SUBSIDIZE THE TO BE ABLE TO MIGRATE AWAY. FROM THE FOSSIL FUEL KIND OF. TRACTORS AND EQUIPMENT AND TO- CLEAN TECHNOLOGY I THINK WILL BE MASSIVELY SUPPORT OF- AND HELPFUL FOR US TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. ABSOLUTELY FIVE. ON THE REGULATORY SIDE ARE WE WANT TO SPECIFICALLY HIGHLIGHT TITLE EIGHT SECTION THREE FOUR FOUR ONE B. WE SEE THIS AS THE PRIMARY REGULATORY ROADBLOCKS. I TO THE LARGER ADOPTION OF THIS TECHNOLOGY IN CALIFORNIA. R. THREE FOUR ONE ONE B. IS AMBIGUOUS TO AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS ARE IT IT DOESN'T ACCOUNT FOR TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES THAT HAVE HAPPENED OVER THE LAST FIFTY YEARS. OUR AND WE BELIEVE THAT CHANGE IS NEEDED TO THIS REGULATION AND IT'S. TIME SENSITIVE AS WELL. I THREE FOUR ONE FOUR. ONE B. R. THE STATE'S THAT ALL SELF. EQUIPMENT SHALL WIN UNDER ITS OWN POWER IN IN MOTION. HAVE AN OPERATOR STATIONED AT THE BEHEST OF OUR CONTROLS. ARE AND THIS CREATES A LOT OF AMBIGUITY IT'S UNCLEAR IF VEHICLES THAT ARE CONTROLLED. THROUGH AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS OR ARE CONTROLLED BY REMOTE OPERATOR. I NEED A STANDARD OR IF THE STANDARD IT HERE EVEN APPLIES TO. ARE THESE VEHICLES WHEN THEY'RE IN THE FIELD WITHOUT ANY SORT OF HUMAN BEINGS IN THE VICINITY. AND IS THIS DOES DIRECTLY AFFECT OUR OR SO MY LEVINE FOURMILE BY BEING ABLE TO HAVE A TANAMI WERE ABLE TO DO THE EXTRA PASSES TO GET INTO THE CLEAN AROUND THE FARMING WITHOUT THE CARBON FOOTPRINT MIGHT BE ELECTRIC. ANOTHER BIG THING IS ALSO- BY BEING ABLE TO HAVE AN OPERATOR ELEVATED INTO A MANAGER POSITION THAT IS AWAY FROM THE TRACTOR ACTUALLY PROTECTING THAT THE OPERATOR. I AND THE TEAMS SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT I FIND YOUR AND YOUR PROTECTING MY FAMILY'S FARM TEAM. AS WELL AS- YOU KNOW THE GREATER AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY SO IT'S AN IMPORTANT THING THAT. WE KNOW I MEAN I'VE I'VE BEEN OUT OF TO OF WINERY AND FRANCE WHEN A TRACTOR ROLLED AND- AN OPERATOR WAS WAS TRAGICALLY KILLED SO THIS IS. NOT A SAFE PLACE TO BE SO HOW DO WE DO THAT SAFELY AND WE ARE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY- WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT FARMING AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES THIS ISN'T A FREEWAY. OR OR THE CITY SO IT'S THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO REALLY CONSIDERED HOW CAN WE GET THROUGH THIS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE. THIS PROGRESS FOR OUR AGRICULTURAL. AND FOOD TO SPEAKER SYSTEMS YEAH I KNOW A COUPLE IMPORTANT POINTS THEIR CARLO AND- THE REGULATIONS WRITTEN BACK IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES ARE PRIMARILY AROUND THE ARAB WORLD ADEQUATE. WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY. THAT A ALONG DITCH I TO STEER EFFECTIVELY ARE HOWEVER SNAPPER. FARMERS FROM ATOP THE MODERN DAY CITY TECHNOLOGY ARE THAT PREVENTS TRACTOR ROLLOVERS CHEMICAL EXPOSURE. AND ALSO P. T. O. N. IN SOME OF THE DANGEROUS. PART OF OUR BEING ON. ARE AND THAT TECHNOLOGY IS A VERY MUCH TOP TO BE I'LL TALK. IN SERVICE THAT CAN VISIONS SORRY IT'S THE INTEL BEING ABLE TO HOUSE FULL CONTROL OF WHAT'S GOING ON THE MACHINE- SO IT IS VERY MUCH COUPLE TO- WHAT WE'RE DOING ON A LARGER SCALE HERE. ARE MOTOR TRACTOR- WE STARTED TO ENGAGE WITH CAL OSHA BACK IN THE END OF TWENTY NINETEEN ARE IN ORDER TO. EDUCATE THEM AND START TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE INTENTIONALLY DEPLOY THESE TECHNOLOGIES AND IN A SAFE WAY- WE'VE BEEN APPROVED NOW FOR A TEMPORARY EXPERIMENT VARIANTS TO DEPLOY. OUR THREE TRACTORS AT TWO DIFFERENT SITES IN CALIFORNIA- BUT IT'S ONLY. FOR A SINGLE CROP TYPE AND THERE'S A- YES. A LIMITATIONS ARE STUCK ON TOP OF THAT- THE CURRENT. A REGULAR AND- REQUIRE EVERY. FAR THAT WANTS TO. DEPLOY THIS KIND OF. ARE AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE AND- IN THE SYSTEM- HOWEVER THE TECH. IS HERE I WILL ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES. TO POINT A TECHNOLOGY CALIFORNIA- AND WE HOPE THAT WE CAN WORK WITH CALIFORNIA TO CONTINUE- TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN MAKE THIS WORK OUT AT A LARGER. THIS QUESTIONS. RIGHT RIGHT. AND IF LOVE THIS TECHNOLOGY- I'D LOVE TO SEE A WORKING LIKE TO SEE WHEN YOU'RE WHERE YOU HAVE IT- BECAUSE LOOK AT THIS IS GREAT FOR START SO NOT GOING TO BE CRITICAL MISSING IN A GREAT. GRAPE ORCHARD GOING FROM BY A BIGGER. THANK THAT THEY WOULD BE SOME OTHER USES WHAT'S- HOURS FOR USE ON A CHARGE ON A TRACTOR YES SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT A TEN HOURS OF TIME I REALLY DEPENDS A LOT ON THE TO DOING SOMETHING THAT'S GROUNDING IT'S GOING TO BE CLOSER FOUR OR FIVE HOURS IF IT JUST AROUND IN COLLECTING WITH THE SAN. ARE YOU LOOKING TWENTY HOURS OF RUNTIME ARE THE CHORE TIME FOR SINGLE BAD ARE IS ANY FROM FOUR TO FIVE HOUR- AGAIN THERE'S ARE COMPLEX AROUND WHAT THEY'RE WHAT GOING TO TRIP LOOKS LIKE A THE FARM THINGS OF THAT. HOWEVER WE DO HAVE SOME BATTERY SYSTEM SO I DOES I WRITTEN. RUN MARK STONE TEN MINUTES BETWEEN THE YEAH HOLD ON JUST SAY MY GUY I TALKED YARD WE ALREADY HAVE ALL THE ELECTRICAL THERE WE THIS WAS WE NEED. SO BECAUSE WE HAVE THE- KIND A STRUCTURE WE EASILY TRACK IN THAT FOUR TO FIVE HOUR TIME PERIOD ALSO THE BASED ON A ZERO TO FULL WELL ALMOST NEVER TO TRY TO THE ARTS ZERO BE LIKE 10% YOU KNOW BY PER OF RIGHT DOWN YEAH. YEAH WHAT'S A GOOD IT'S ABOUT FOR- YOU PEOPLE TO GET A BECAUSE AS WE STILL LIVE IN THE WINTERTIME WE'RE USUALLY WORKING ON OUR BOB BARR TRACKED IN OUR- OUR QUICK MAY ENOUGH AND FIX THEM. BUT THE SAME STUFF THAT DOESN'T NOW YEAH SYSTEM WOULD DO THIS. ONE NO QUESTIONS- YEAH I MEAN JUST JUST ECHOING WITH THE MEMBER JUST MENTIONED. IT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT NEVER GONNA NEED MORE TEACHERS MORE MECHANICS THE QUESTION IS TO YOU GUYS IS THAT DO YOU GUYS OFFER THAT MECHANICAL HEALTH. YES SO WE DO- ESSENTIALLY USERS TWO SIDES OF THAT STORY ONE IS THAT THE- COULDN'T ITSELF NEEDS A LESS MAINTENANCE BECAUSE IT IS ELECTRIFY A LOT LESS MOVING PARTS- BUT YOU'RE STARTING TO MOVE INTO KIND OF NEW AREAS THAT MOST MECHANICS HAVEN'T SEEN. BEFORE ANSWER LIKE THINGS LIKE HIGH VOLTAGE OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS WE'VE DONE OUR BEST TO MAKE THINGS MODULAR- SO SHIPPING PARTS ARE ENABLING THE FARMERS ARE FARMERS IN THE FARM MECHANICS TO ACTUALLY PERFORM THE MAINTENANCE THEMSELVES ARE WE HAVE. OUR INSTRUCTIONS THAT COME UP ON THE SCREEN AND ARE AVAILABLE ON THE APP WE VERY MUCH WANT TO ENABLE ARE KIND OF THE- THE MECHANICS THEMSELVES AND THEN THERE ARE SOME TRAININGS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON DOING NOW IT'S A LITTLE EARLY FOR KIND OF THE STAGE THAT WE'RE AT. BUT. IT IS SOMETHING THAT WERE ACTIVELY ADDRESSING. YOU SURE SOUNDS ANY OTHER QUESTIONS PRESENTATION THANK YOU THANK YOU AND WE DON'T HAVE AYE YOU GUYS TO COME AND SEE THE FACTORY AND DOES IT- THE LAB AND EVERYTHING AND SEE THE TRACTORS AND AN ACTION. SO PLAN PERCENT WILL BE THERE THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NEXT WE HAVE- MUNOZ SHOWMAN COUNSEL PACIFIC COAST PRODUCERS. NUMBER THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHARITY OF THE DO A AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR INVITING PACIFIC COAST PRODUCERS TO THIS PANEL TODAY WE APPRECIATE BEING INCLUDED- I HAVE TO SAY IT'S KIND OF TOUGH TO BE THE LAST SPEAKER ON THE PANEL WITH- ALL THESE EXCELLENT SPEAKERS WHO HAVE GONE BEFORE ME AND ALL THE REALLY GOOD INFORMATION THAT THEY'VE PROVIDED WHICH YOU KNOW HAS SPEND- REALLY EXCELLENT INFORMATION AND- I HAVE TO SAY. A LOT OF WHAT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED TODAY ARE THEMES THAT WE'RE SEEING AS WELL AND SO YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO REPEAT A LOT OF INFORMATION YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD- BUT- YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT ON FARM AGRICULTURE AND- TECHNOLOGY. IN THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY I WANT TO SHIFT THE FOCUS A LITTLE BIT NOW TO. THE PROF FOOD PRODUCTION INDUSTRY- SO THERE ARE A LOT OF PARALLELS AND WHEN I'VE LISTENED TO THE SPEAKERS TODAY THERE'S A LOT OF CHANGE OCCURRING IN THE INDUSTRY. AND THE TECHNOLOGY IS CREATING CHANGE IN THE WORK FORCE- THE AGING WORKFORCE IS DEFINITELY SOMETHINGTHAT WE'RE SEEING- CONNECTING THE ADEQUATE EDUCATION TO THE LOCATION IN WHICH OUR WORKERS- LIVE AND WORK IS ALSO A CHALLENGE. AND- THE SPEAKER MENTIONED THE ISSUE OF SCALE BRINGING SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS TO SMALLER COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE'S- SMALLER PEOPLE BUT YOU'VE GOT TO CONNECT THE RESOURCES SO THAT. YOU CAN PROVIDE PROGRAMS IN MANY DIFFERENT AREAS SO THAT THERE'S A LOT OF CHALLENGES TO WHAT WERE FACING WITH OUR WORK FORCE- YOU KNOW AGRICULTURE AND FRESH FOOD IS AWESOME AND WE LOVE IT- BUT THERE'S A DISCONNECT BETWEEN A LOT OF FOR THE POPULATION LIVES AND WHERE A LOT OF THE FOOD IS GROWN SO. THE FOOD PRODUCTION MANUFACTURING SIDE OF THE EQUATION IS VERY IMPORTANT WE PRESERVE FOOD- WE ARE NOT- PROCESSED IN THE SENSE THAT WE'RE A HIGHLY PROCESSED FOOD WHAT WE DO AND OTHERS IN OUR INDUSTRY. IS PRESERVED FOODS FOR SHELF STABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION ALL OVER THE COUNTRY ALL OVER THE WORLD- CANNING FREEZING AND DRYING OR ALL MINIMALLY PROCESSED AND PRESERVE- THE HEALTHY NATURE OF THE FOOD THAT'S GROWN. OUR COMPANY PACIFIC COAST PRODUCERS IS A GROWER OWNED AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVE OUR GROWERS GROW UP PEACHES PEARS TOMATOES APER CARTS AND GRAPES. AND ARE A FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THREE PRODUCTION PLANTS- ONE UP IN ORVILLE ABOUT TWO HOURS NORTH OF HERE. ONE IN THE WOODLAND AREA AND SENATOR FOR US USE ME ASSEMBLY MEMBER. AGUILAR CRUZ AREA AND- LODI WHERE A ASSEMBLY MAN COOPER REPRESENTS US AND- THIS REVIEW HAS BEEN TO OUR- OUR LOCATIONS AND WE APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH. WE CURRENTLY- EMPLOYED ABOUT A THOUSAND FULL TIME YEAR ROUND EMPLOYEES AND ABOUT. THREE THOUSAND TO THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED SEASONAL EMPLOYEES CENTRAL VALLEY CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES THAT ARE CULTURALLY AND ETHNICALLY DIVERSE IN OUR WORK FORCE IS ABOUT 60% LATINO AND ABOUT 30% EAST INDIAN AND AFGHANI. OUR EMPLOYEES ARE PRIMARILY LOCAL TO THEIR COMMUNITY AND ARE SEASONAL WORKERS STAY ON THE LOCAL COMMUNITY AND DO A VARIETY OF JOBS IN THE OFF SEASON SO IT'S A VERY STABLE WORK FORCE. OUR EMPLOYEES ARE REPRESENTED BY THE TEAMSTERS CANNERY COUNCIL AND I WERE OR SPECIALLY MADE MASKS TODAY WHICH HAS THE TEAMSTERS LOGO AND OTHER PRODUCERS ALLIANCE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS OUR MULTI EMPLOYER BARGAINING GROUP WE'VE ENJOYED A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE- TEAMSTERS OVER MANY DECADES IT'S NOT ALWAYS WITHOUT CONTENTION OF COURSE BUT- YOU KNOW WE WORK WITH THEM VERY WELL. I DID WANT TO MENTION A COUPLE PROGRAMS THAT WE APPRECIATE THAT'S OUR US UNRELATED TO NECESSARILY THE WORK FORCE BUT OUR GROWERS ENJOYED THE SWEEP PROGRAM THE STATE WATER EFFICIENCY ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM. AND THE FARMER PROGRAM WHICH IS A PROGRAM THAT. HELPS AG REPLACE ADEQUATE WENT THROUGH CARB AS WELL AS THE HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM. NOW WE DON'T DIRECTLY PARTICIPATED IN THE FARMING OF OUR CROPS THE WE TAKE DELIVERY OF THE CROPS AT OUR FACILITIES- BUT ONE PROGRAM THAT'S BEEN HELPFUL FOR US AT PACIFIC COAST PRODUCERS HAS BEEN THE FOOD PROCESS. FOOD PROCESSOR INVESTMENT PROGRAM THIS WAS A PROGRAM THAT WAS CREATED WITH FUNDS FROM THE- GREENHOUSE GAS PROGRAM. UNDER THAT IS A GRANT PROGRAM TO HELP US PUT ENERGY EFFICIENT AND MORE SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT AND TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE ASES AND OUR FACILITIES. WE'VE HAD- SEVERAL PROJECTS AND PUT IN- HIGHEST HIGH EFFICIENCY EVAPORATOR- UPGRADED TO MADE A HT BREAKS- IN THE- TOMATO PASTE PRODUCTION AS WELL AS ENERGY EFFICIENT REFRIGERATION SYSTEMS AND THAT'S BEEN VERY APPRECIATED AND VERY HELPFUL IN US BECOMING. MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT AND REDUCING OUR GREENHOUSE GAS- YEAH- OUR FOOD- FOOD PRODUCTION IN THE PAST HAS BEEN HIGHLY MANUAL AT OUR FACILITIES RUN TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK ONCE THE HARVEST BEGINS UNTIL THE HARVEST ENDS. IN THE OFFSEASON ARE FULL TIME WORK FORCE CONDUCTS MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR- AND- CONDUCTS CAPITAL PROJECTS TO IMPROVE THE FACILITIES AND AT OUR LOAD I PLANT THE- DECORATE A FORKLIFT A GIANT FORKLIFT INTO A HOLIDAY TRAIN THAT PARTICIPATES IN THE LOCAL FOR A- PARADE OF LIGHTS. WHICH IS TOMORROW BY THE WAY- SO IN RECENT DECADES WE HAVE AUTOMATED AND- INCREASE TECHNOLOGY ON OUR PLANS IN ORDER TO INCREASE EFFICIENCIES BUT ALSO TO MAKE OUR JOBS A LITTLE BIT EASIER I THINK THERE'S BEEN A THEME HERE THAT A LOT OF THE LOW PAY ON HARD WORK WAS ALSO REFLECTED IN THE PROCESSING FACILITIES IN THE PAST AND THAT IS CHANGING. ALONG WITH THE CHALLENGES OF THE AGING WORKFORCE AND THE LACK OF STAFF HAS ACCELERATED THIS PROCESS IN RECENT TIMES NO I DID PROVIDE- SOME SLIDES FOR YOU AND I WON'T GO THROUGH EACH ONE OF THEM BUT I DID WANT TO MAKE COMMENTS ON A FEW OF THEM THE FIRST FLIGHT IS OUR HIGH PRESSURE STEAM BOILER WE PUT THAT IN OUR WOODLAND PLANT- TWO YEARS AGO. AND THAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST STATE OF THE ART BOILER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT'S- VERY ENERGY EFFICIENT AND THE PROTECT THE PEOPLE WHO OPERATE THOSE BOILERS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE MORE HMI HUMAN MACHINE INTERFACE WORKING WITH SCREENS WORKING WITH DATA THE AIR QUALITY REGULATIONS OF COURSE BECOME MORE DETAILED AND SO WE NEED TO EDUCATE OUR BOILER OPERATORS TO BE MORE SOPHISTICATED- THE NEXT SLIDE IS THE OPTICAL SORTING TECHNOLOGY. SO IN THE PAST THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A BELT WITH PEOPLE ALONG SIDE THE BUILT RESORT MANUALLY SORTING THANK YOU AWESOME AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE NEXT PAGE IT SHOWS YOU WITH THE- PROGRESSION OF THE TECHNOLOGY WHERE THE CAMERAS CAN SEE AS WELL AS THE HUMAN EYE AND THOUGH FRUITS GOES THROUGH THE MACHINES VERY QUICKLY ON THEM THE MACHINE IDENTIFIES A BLEMISHED FRUIT AND- PUFFS AIR. THAT THE FRUIT TO KNOCK IT DOWN BELOW THE BELT THAT'S GOING ON INTO THE PROCESSING IT'S REALLY A QUITE INTERESTING. AND FASCINATING TECHNOLOGY- THE NEXT PAGE THAT SEE ON THE AUTOMATED TOMATO FLOW OPERATING ALL OF THESE POINTS OF- TRANSFERENCE WHERE THE TOMATOES COME INTO THE PLANTS ARE TRANSFERRED BY FLAMES AND RINSED AND GO UP THE ELEVATORS INTO THE PLANTS THIS WILL ALL BE AUTOMATED AND SO. HAS SOME OF THE DISCUSSION YOU'VE HEARD BEFORE ABOUT THE AUTO REMOTE OPERATING GATES AND REMOTE MONITORING OF QUALITY AND THINGS LIKE THAT IS WHERE WE'RE HEADED WITH OUR PLANTS AS WELL. THE NEXT PICTURE THE PL SEASON OUTPUT DISPLAYS IS JUST TO SHOW YOU WHAT THE THIS CHANGES IN OUR PLANTS WE HAVE NOW YOU KNOW HIGHLY AUTOMATED DIGITAL READ OUT SO THAT. ULTIMATELY WE WOULD LIKE TO GET TO A LIVE REAL TIME- READ OF THE PRODUCT GOING THROUGH OUR PLANS AT THE MOMENT SO THAT YOU CAN MAKE ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT AT THE TIME SO THAT WILL MAKE US MORE EFFICIENT AND AGAIN. IT JUST INCREASES THE NEED FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN WORK WITH THESE TYPES OF TECHNOLOGIES- THERE'S MORE SLIDES ABOUT OUR OUR CASE STACKING ROBOTICS WHICH MAKES THE WORK LESS MANUAL FOR PEOPLE WHICH IS A GOOD THING IT'S HARD WORK. OR PALLETIZER AUTOMATION. AND OUR CANS STACKING ALL OF THESE- REQUIRE. PEOPLE WHO CAN SERVICE THESE MACHINES SO WHEN YOU EARLIER ASKED ABOUT TECHNOLOGY ELIMINATING SOME JOBS I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW THEY PROBABLY WILL ELIMINATE SOME JOBS IT'LL ELIMINATE MAYBE THOSE SORTING JOBS OR THE SANITATION JOBS WHERE YOU'RE THERE WITH THE HIGH PRESSURE WAND. CLEANING EQUIPMENT BUT WHAT IT WILL CHANGE THAT TO IS YOU NEED THE PEOPLE TO MAINTAIN THE EQUIPMENT YOU NEED PEOPLE TO PROGRAM THE CONTROLS TO READ THE CONTROLS TO MAKE UP THE APPROPRIATE DECISIONS OFF OF THE DATA THAT THEY GET FROM THAT TECHNOLOGY IN ORDER TO RUN THE OPERATIONS. SO CAN I JUST INTERRUPT YOU YES OF COURSE I MEAN. IT WILL HOW DO YOU RECRUIT WE'RE WORRIED GETTING YOUR LABOR FORCE FOR THIS. SO CURRENTLY WE HAVE IT'S A CHALLENGE SO WE HAVE A VARIETY OF WAYS OF RECRUITING WE- pOF OUT OF STATE- ENTITIES THERE'S A PERRY TECHNICAL INSTITUTE UP IN YAKIMA WASHINGTON THAT HAS A- STE- INSTITUTE THAT SPECIFICALLY TARGETED TOWARDS CONTROLS TAX AN INSTRUMENT TAX. AND YOU GO TO THEIR JOB FAIRS AND THERE'S ACTUALLY NATIONAL EMPLOYERS THEY ARE LOOKING FOR THE SAME THING THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR I WAS VERY ENCOURAGED TODAY TO HEAR THE GENTLEMAN FROM HARTNELL COLLEGE AND- MAYBE TALKING TO HIM AFTERWARDS BECAUSE I WAS VERY INTERESTED IN HIS PROGRAM. AND I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE STATE HELPS SUPPORT THE EXPORT OF THOSE TYPES OF PROGRAMS TO OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGES BECAUSE I THINK IT'S TRUE THAT PEOPLE IN OUR INDUSTRY LIKE TO STAY WHERE THEY ARE AND SO WE NEED TO GET THE EDUCATION TO THEM SO THAT THEY KNOW THAT THERE'S GOOD JOBS IN THEIR COMMUNITY. THAT THEY CAN HAVE- YOU KNOW WELL PAYING JOBS WITH BENEFITS THAT THEY CAN SUPPORT THEIR FAMILY ON AND THEY CAN STAY WHERE THEY ARE SO YOU KNOW I THINK THAT'S- THAT'S VERY HELPFUL WE ALSO YOU KNOW DO WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE DOES AND PUT JOBS ON INDEED AND MONSTER AND ALL THOSE SORTS OF THINGS- SO- IT. IT'S A CHALLENGE IT'S A CHALLENGE TO RECRUIT. THANK YOU FOR THESE TYPES OF AND AGAIN I THINK IT'S BEEN SAID EARLIER AG. AND FOOD PROCESSING IS NOT NECESSARILY A DESIRED CAREER- PEOPLE WANT TO GO WORK FOR GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO WE NEED TO MAKE OUR- JOB OPPORTUNITIES. MORE MARKETED TO PEOPLE SO THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THERE'S SOME GOOD OPPORTUNITIES. AND WE DO A GOOD THING WE FEED THE NATION WE FEED THE WORLD IT'S NOT- IT'S NOT A NEGATIVE TO BE IN THE FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRY- SO AS FAR AS YOU KNOW LOOKING FORWARD. AS TO WHAT TO DO NOW WE'VE PARTICIPATED IN SOME LOCAL PROGRAMS ARE LOCAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HAD A PROGRAM WHERE WE TRIED TO GET OUR MECHANICS AND OUR ELECTRICIANS TO GO TO THE SCHOOLS TO THE HIGH SCHOOLS AND TALK TO THE- STUDENTS THERE ABOUT HEY YOU KNOW YOU CAN GO TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE GET AN EDUCATION AND HAVE A GOOD JOB HERE. AND THAT'S- BEEN SOMEWHAT SUCCESSFUL BUT AGAIN IT'S A QUESTION OF SCALE- AND IT'S A QUESTION OF RESOURCES TO DO THAT- THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION WELL I'M- SURE YOU PROBABLY ARE WELL FAMILIAR WITH DID A REPORT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TALKING ABOUT- THE AUTOMATED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND ITS IMPACT ON THE WORK FORCE. AND IN THAT REPORT THEY READ MADE SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS AND A COUPLE I FELT WERE RELEVANT TO THE ISSUE TODAY AND ONE OF THOSE WAS THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD IMPLEMENT CHANGES TO IMPROVE ITS DATA COLLECTION ON JOBS AND SKILLS FOR FUTURE WORKERS SO THAT A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WORKFORCE AND EMPLOYMENT NEEDS TRANSISTORIZED AND PLANNING. FOR EXAMPLE THE HOOVER COMMISSION REFERRED TO THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE FOR LABOR MARKET RESEARCH THE CENTER OF EXCELLENCE CONDUCTS SPECIAL PROJECTS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF THE WORKFORCE IN EVOLVING AND EMERGING INDUSTRIES BY CONDUCTING POINT IN TIME SURVEYS AND TALKING TO EMPLOYERS AND CONTROLLED WAYS THE CENTER OF EXCELLENCE HAS ACCURATE REAL TIME INFORMATION ON JOB TRENDS. SO THAT WOULD BE AN EXISTING RESOURCE THAT COULD BE UTILIZED TO HELP PLAN FOR HOW TO HOW TO EXPEND RESOURCES AND TARGET RESOURCES TOWARDS IMPROVING OUR OUR WORK- APPRENTICESHIPS AND OTHER TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES SHOULD BE PROMOTED BY CALIFORNIA FOR PRIVATE INDUSTRIES WHERE JOBS ARE DISPLACED BY TECHNOLOGY- TAX CREDITS HAVE BEEN MENTIONED AS A TOOL TO DO THAT- FINALLY THE HOOVER COMMISSION RECOMMENDED THE STATE PARTNER WITH NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS- WHICH PROVIDE TOOLS FOR JOB SEARCHES AND ONLINE. A LEARNING WHICH AGAIN WAS SPOKEN ABOUT TODAY WITHIN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CONTEXT WHICH- WOULD BE IN OUR VIEW A VERY POSITIVE THING. SO YOU KNOW IN SHORT I THINK THIS HAS BEEN MENTIONED ALSO THE STATE'S RIGHT NOW SEEMS TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A SURPLUS AND WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE PART OF THAT SURPLUS GO. TOWARDS ENCOURAGING AND FUNDING SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE IN PROCESS AND A LOT OF GOOD IDEAS AND I THINK IT'S JUST BRINGING THEM TOGETHER AND COORDINATING AND PROVIDING SOME FUNDING. FOR THE GOOD PROGRAMS THAT WILL HELP PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE VERY ADVANTAGEOUS AND AS AN EMPLOYER YOU KNOW WE CERTAINLY STAND WILLING TO PARTICIPATE IN PROGRAMS LIKE THAT. FROM BEING HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. WHAT ARE THE PRIORITY FOR THE- FIGURING UP WITH- WHAT KIND YOU WERE READING THE STATE CALIFORNIA. POPPIES HERE SAVE ON. THE LAST LITTLE WHILE AND I LOVE THE ANIMATION OR THE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU WE'VE YOUR SUPPORT. I HAVE A- YOU MEANT THERE WAS A- THAT WOULD. UPDATE THE WORK FOR DATA. I WOULD YOUR ON ALL THIS OPINION ON UPDATING OUR REGULATIONS. UPDATING REGULATIONS- WELL WITH RESPECT TO- TECHNOLOGY IN THE WORK FORCE- YOU KNOW I DON'TSEE REGULATIONS AS A BURDEN IN THAT RESPECT I THINK IT'S REALLY PUTTING TOGETHER PROGRAMS TO HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND CONNECT THEM WITH WITH THE EMPLOYERS. I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS HERE- MICHELIN THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU I APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU. OKAY. YEAH.
