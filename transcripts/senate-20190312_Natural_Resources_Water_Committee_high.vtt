STATE PARKS.

00:08:08.554 --> 00:08:10.489
WE HAVE ONE CONCERN ABOUT HOW

00:08:10.556 --> 00:08:11.991
THE BILL AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN.

00:08:12.058 --> 00:08:13.226
AND THAT IS WE'RE COMING FROM A

00:08:13.292 --> 00:08:14.594
PERSPECTIVE OF THE RANGER IN THE

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.964
FIELD HAVING TO ENFORCE THIS

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:19.398
ENFORCEABILITY.

00:08:19.465 --> 00:08:21.200
THE BILL IS CURRENTLY REAL --

00:08:21.267 --> 00:08:24.036
WRITTEN ALLOWS --

00:08:24.103 --> 00:08:25.504
A EXEMPTION FOR RELIGIOUS

00:08:25.571 --> 00:08:26.772
BELIEFS.

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:28.841
RELIGIOUS BELIEF IS A NEBULOUS

00:08:28.908 --> 00:08:31.043
ITEM -- IT'D

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.511
BE VERY HARD FOR A RANGER IN THE

00:08:32.578 --> 00:08:33.646
FIELD TO DETERMINE WHAT A

00:08:33.713 --> 00:08:35.648
PERSON'S BELIEF IS WHICH IS

00:08:35.715 --> 00:08:37.450
REALLY A SELF EXPRESSION.

00:08:37.516 --> 00:08:38.784
WE KNOW THAT RELIGIOUS BELIEFS

00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:40.553
HAVE THE FULL GAMUT EVEN THINGS

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:41.988
THAT ARE TOTALLY LEGAL.

00:08:42.054 --> 00:08:44.056
MULTIPLE WIVES AND THINGS WITH

00:08:44.123 --> 00:08:45.391
THE YOU'LL BE VERY DIFFICULT IN

00:08:45.458 --> 00:08:47.994
FACT COULD BECOME IMPOSSIBLE.

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.363
TO ENFORCE THIS LAW.

00:08:50.429 --> 00:08:54.667
IF SOME. TO FIND A SMOKING AREA

00:08:54.734 --> 00:08:55.701
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE NINETY

00:08:55.768 --> 00:08:58.271
NINE POINT 9% OF REGULAR SMOKERS.

00:08:58.337 --> 00:08:59.972
NOT THOSE WHO ARE PRACTICING A

00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:01.807
RELIGIOUS BELIEFS.

00:09:01.874 --> 00:09:03.042
FOUND OUT AND THEY WOULD THROUGH

00:09:03.109 --> 00:09:04.610
THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA

00:09:04.677 --> 00:09:06.045
THAT THE MAGIC WORDS IS

00:09:06.112 --> 00:09:08.347
SMOKING'S A PART OF MY RELIGIOUS

00:09:08.414 --> 00:09:09.515
BELIEFS.

00:09:09.582 --> 00:09:10.783
THE RANGER IN THE FIELD WE HAVE

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.052
NO WAY. TO DETERMINE WHETHER

00:09:13.119 --> 00:09:14.487
THAT'S TRUE BECAUSE IT'S A

00:09:14.553 --> 00:09:15.321
BELIEVE.

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:17.990
IT'S NOT A PRACTICE OR CEREMONY

00:09:18.057 --> 00:09:20.760
WHICH IS ALSO IN THE BILL FOR

00:09:20.826 --> 00:09:21.294
INSTANCE --

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.228
WELL.

00:09:22.295 --> 00:09:24.931
SO IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT.

00:09:24.997 --> 00:09:25.998
NONE OF THE CURRENT SMOKING BANS

00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:27.300
THAT WE RESEARCH HAVE A

00:09:27.366 --> 00:09:29.769
RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION OF THIS TYPE.

00:09:29.835 --> 00:09:31.971
FOR INSTANCE IF THAT EXEMPTION

00:09:32.038 --> 00:09:33.005
WAS WRITTEN INTO THE LAW THAT

00:09:33.072 --> 00:09:35.241
PROHIBITS SMOKING IN THE

00:09:35.308 --> 00:09:36.375
BUILDING AND SOMEONE LIT UP IN

00:09:36.442 --> 00:09:37.910
THE AUDIENCE.

00:09:37.977 --> 00:09:38.511
AND THE SERGEANT OF ARMS WAS

00:09:38.577 --> 00:09:40.613
ASKED. TO HAVE THEM LEAVE WORK

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.214
QUIT SMOKING.

00:09:42.281 --> 00:09:43.582
AND THEY COULD SAY IT'S MY

00:09:43.649 --> 00:09:47.186
RELEASE BELIEVE THE SERGEANT

00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:49.088
ARMS WOULD HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT

00:09:49.155 --> 00:09:49.288
TIME.

00:09:49.355 --> 00:09:52.591
AFTER TRAINING WHAT THAT MEANT.

00:09:52.658 --> 00:09:54.560
WE'RE VERY CONCERNED THAT THIS

00:09:54.627 --> 00:09:57.530
LANGUAGE WOULD LEAD VERY QUICKLY

00:09:57.596 --> 00:10:00.833
TO US SORT OF MAGIC WORD THING

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:04.236
RELIGION IS MY BELIEF --

00:10:04.303 --> 00:10:06.105
ALSO PART APARTMENT CURRNTLY

00:10:06.172 --> 00:10:08.174
HAS QUITE A FEW LAWS RULES AND

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.709
REGULATIONS ON THE CONDUCT

00:10:09.775 --> 00:10:12.244
PEOPLE CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS.

00:10:12.311 --> 00:10:14.146
WE HAVE A WE HAVE A SYSTEM OF

00:10:14.213 --> 00:10:15.581
PERMITTING THAT ALLOWS

00:10:15.648 --> 00:10:17.049
EXCEPTIONS TO THAT AND THERE'S

00:10:17.116 --> 00:10:18.217
THOUSANDS OF THEM.

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:20.219
IT IS EVERYTHING FROM GROUND

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:22.121
FIRES --

00:10:22.188 --> 00:10:23.255
LOUD MUSIC RELIGIOUS OR

00:10:23.322 --> 00:10:25.291
OTHERWISE AND ALL KINDS OF OTHER

00:10:25.358 --> 00:10:25.591
ACTIVITIES.

00:10:25.658 --> 00:10:26.892
THESE PERMITS ALLOW THE

00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:28.194
DEPARTMENT.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.297
TO LOOK AT THE ACTIVITY SAY A

00:10:31.364 --> 00:10:32.198
PERSON WANTS TO HAVE AN EVENT

00:10:32.264 --> 00:10:32.965
WITH.

00:10:33.032 --> 00:10:34.834
LOUD AMPLIFIED MUSIC THEY CAN'T

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.335
DO IT ORDINARILY BUT WITH THE

00:10:36.402 --> 00:10:37.770
PROPER PERMIT IN THE PROPER

00:10:37.837 --> 00:10:39.572
PLACE IN TIME THEY CAN WHETHER

00:10:39.638 --> 00:10:41.107
IT'S RELIGIOUS OR OTHERWISE SO.

00:10:41.173 --> 00:10:43.309
WE HAVE THE SYSTEM THAT'S IN

00:10:43.376 --> 00:10:43.976
PLACE.

00:10:44.043 --> 00:10:46.078
WE THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE.

00:10:46.145 --> 00:10:49.515
THE WAY TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY

00:10:49.582 --> 00:10:51.751
WITH THIS IS.

00:10:51.817 --> 00:10:52.752
JUST THAT YOU KNOW ONE TENTH OF

00:10:52.818 --> 00:10:53.386
A PERCENT.

00:10:53.452 --> 00:10:55.221
SO WE'RE PROPOSING AS IT'S

00:10:55.287 --> 00:10:58.257
ALREADY IN THE BILL FOR FILMING.

00:10:58.324 --> 00:11:00.393
THAT THE LANGUAGE BE AS PROPERLY

00:11:00.459 --> 00:11:01.594
PERMITTED [inaudible]

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.929
ALTERNATIVELY.

00:11:03.996 --> 00:11:05.531
EVEN TAKING OUT THE WORD BELIEF

00:11:05.598 --> 00:11:06.966
AND JUST SLOUGHING RELIGIOUS

00:11:07.033 --> 00:11:08.501
CEREMONY WE LOVE THE RANGER IN

00:11:08.567 --> 00:11:10.136

TELL ME ABOUT THAT CEREMONY MAKE

00:11:16.575 --> 00:11:18.244
SOME JUDGMENT WHETHER IT'S

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:19.845
LEGITIMATE OR NOT BUT IF THE

00:11:19.912 --> 00:11:21.881
PERSON SAYS I JUST BELIEVE IT.

00:11:21.947 --> 00:11:22.882
THEIR STOCK.

00:11:22.948 --> 00:11:24.283
SO WE ASK THE COMMITTEE. TO

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:25.651
CONSIDER ONE OF THOSE TWO

00:11:25.718 --> 00:11:28.421
OPTIONS IN THIS BILL SO THAT IN

00:11:28.487 --> 00:11:29.555
THE FIELD WHEN THE RANGERS ARE

00:11:29.622 --> 00:11:31.657
OUT THERE TRYING TO ENFORCE IT.

00:11:31.724 --> 00:11:33.259
THEY CAN CARRY OUT THE INTENT OF

00:11:33.325 --> 00:11:37.329
THIS BILL.

00:11:37.396 --> 00:11:37.997

THINGS FIRST DIED IN THE LAST

00:16:18.344 --> 00:16:20.045
TWO VERSIONS OF THIS LEGISLATION

00:16:20.112 --> 00:16:21.547
THERE WAS NEVER AN ISSUE RAISED

WATER DATA.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:09.367
IT HAS COME TO MY ATTENTION THAT

00:26:09.434 --> 00:26:11.369
CALIFORNIA HAS LOST THE ABILITY

00:26:11.436 --> 00:26:13.605
TO MEASURE STREAM FLOW A VERY

00:26:13.672 --> 00:26:16.341
IMPORTANT TYPE OF DATA. 86% OF

THE STATE'S SIGNIFICANT STREAMS

00:26:18.043 --> 00:26:20.178

UNFORTUNATELY THE LAST DECADE

00:26:29.387 --> 00:26:30.822
NEARLY HALF OF THOSE GAUGES HAVE

00:26:30.889 --> 00:26:32.324
BECOME INACTIVE.

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:34.359

RELIABLE SUPPLY OF WATER IS

00:26:39.831 --> 00:26:40.966
DIMINISHED.

SAYS.

00:32:46.097 --> 00:32:47.398
ABOUT THIRTY SIX HUNDRED

THE GAUGES COULD BE REACTIVATED --

00:33:24.335 --> 00:33:24.902
WITH VERY MINIMAL EFFORT AT THE

00:33:24.969 --> 00:33:28.106

TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND AND TO

00:33:38.549 --> 00:33:41.119
ABOUT HALF THAT USGS ESTIMATES

00:33:41.185 --> 00:33:42.987

00:33:44.255 --> 00:33:44.455

00:33:44.522 --> 00:33:46.357
WHAT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING WITH --

00:33:46.424 --> 00:33:47.925
STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES ABOUT

00:33:47.992 --> 00:33:50.161
IS A FORMULA IN WHICH THE THE

00:33:50.228 --> 00:33:51.829

TRANSPARENCY AND THAT --

01:12:24.473 --> 01:12:26.175
WHAT I WANT TO DO IS MAKE THIS

01:12:26.241 --> 01:12:28.277
PROJECT MORE COSTLY OR STOP THE

01:12:28.343 --> 01:12:30.446
PROJECT ALTOGETHER NOTHING COULD

BIT BRING THIS BILL FORDIS

01:12:37.519 --> 01:12:39.555
BECAUSE THE OTHER MEMBES THAT

01:12:39.621 --> 01:12:41.356
ARE IN THE DELTA AREA WE FOUND

01:12:41.423 --> 01:12:43.325
IT JUST NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO BE

01:12:43.392 --> 01:12:44.560
ABLE TO ANSWER.

01:12:44.626 --> 01:12:46.562

ACTIONS AT THE END THE SESSION

01:12:57.639 --> 01:12:58.907
LAST YEAR --

01:12:58.974 --> 01:13:01.276
THIS THING MIGHT HAVE GONE --

01:13:01.343 --> 01:13:03.378
FOR THE FURTHER AND THEN IT DID

01:13:03.445 --> 01:13:05.481
AND FRANKLY A LOT OF THE

01:13:05.547 --> 01:13:07.249
OBJECTIONS FROM --

01:13:07.316 --> 01:13:08.517

01:13:08.584 --> 01:13:10.753
ADDRESS --

01:13:10.819 --> 01:13:12.421
WE JUST FELT LIKE THERE NEEDS TO

01:13:12.488 --> 01:13:15.124
BE SOME LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT.

01:13:15.190 --> 01:13:16.959
AGAIN I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:13:17.025 --> 01:13:17.659
WE THAT'S WHY I TOOK THE

01:13:17.726 --> 01:13:18.627
AMENDMENTS.

01:13:18.694 --> 01:13:20.362
I DON'T WANT ANY STATE PROJECTS

01:13:20.429 --> 01:13:22.564
TO BECOME MORE EXPENSIVE FOR OUR

01:13:22.631 --> 01:13:24.066
RATE PAYERS.

01:13:24.133 --> 01:13:26.201
VIEWS LET'S FACES LEGISLATORS.

01:13:26.268 --> 01:13:28.070
OUR CONSTITUENTS OUR RATE PAYERS

01:13:28.137 --> 01:13:29.238
AND WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO HAVE

01:13:29.304 --> 01:13:32.074
THEIR COSTS GO UP OR HAVE YOU

01:13:32.141 --> 01:13:34.743
KNOW TAKE THE PROJECT --

01:13:34.810 --> 01:13:37.146
OUT YOU KNOW OUT LONGER.

01:13:37.212 --> 01:13:38.947
BUT I WOULD JUST ECHO AS EARLY

01:13:39.014 --> 01:13:40.449
AS THE CENTER DAHLE COMMENTS IN

01:13:40.516 --> 01:13:41.517
IN SAY THAT.

01:13:41.583 --> 01:13:44.153
BECOME AS RELATIVE TO A PUBLIC --

01:13:44.219 --> 01:13:46.188
PROCESS THOSE ARE ALL ACCURATE

01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:48.056
AND NOT WITH ANY DISPUTE ABOUT

01:13:48.123 --> 01:13:49.925
THAT BUT THINK THE ARGUE ABOUT

01:13:49.992 --> 01:13:51.393
GREATER TRANSPARENCY ANSWER THE

01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:52.661
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND I KNOW

01:13:52.728 --> 01:13:54.396
SOME OF YOU SURELY HAVE SEEN YOU

01:13:54.463 --> 01:13:55.097
HERE BEFORE --

01:13:55.164 --> 01:13:57.332
YOU KNOW JUST LEGISLATIVE BODIES --

01:13:57.399 --> 01:13:59.535
IN IN IN THE PAST AND AS MUCH AS

01:13:59.601 --> 01:14:02.104
WE MAY NOT LIKE THE PROJECT WE

01:14:02.171 --> 01:14:03.705
ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A

01:14:03.772 --> 01:14:05.140
PROCESS IN THIS ONE WE'RE

01:14:05.207 --> 01:14:06.775
OBVIOUSLY THIS LEGISLATURE AND

01:14:06.842 --> 01:14:08.243
DID THIS COMMITTEE AND CERTAINLY.

01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:09.077
MINISTRATION INSTEAD OF

01:14:09.144 --> 01:14:11.013
CALIFORNIA THE AUTHORITIES --

01:14:11.079 --> 01:14:13.348
VESTED IN THEM TO MOVE FORWARD

01:14:13.415 --> 01:14:14.616
WITH PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS BUT

01:14:14.683 --> 01:14:15.517
THERE.

01:14:15.584 --> 01:14:19.721
YEAH AT STAKE IS CERTAINLY IS

01:14:19.788 --> 01:14:23.692
OUR IMPACTS TO A MET MEAL FOLKS

01:14:23.759 --> 01:14:24.326
A WITH THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

01:14:24.393 --> 01:14:25.994
CALIFORNIA AND THAT. TO ARGUE

01:14:26.061 --> 01:14:28.063
THAT TRANSPARENCY IF IT'S NOT

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:30.232
GOING TO RESULT IN UNDUE DELAY

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:32.968
AND OR UNDUE COST OR WRITTEN TO

01:14:33.035 --> 01:14:34.236
ME SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE BIT

01:14:34.303 --> 01:14:35.637
COUNTER TO TO GOOD GVERNMENT IN

01:14:35.704 --> 01:14:36.538
FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THAT

01:14:36.605 --> 01:14:37.806
COMMON SENSE OF THIS BILL.

01:14:37.873 --> 01:14:39.274
I THINK IT REDUCES TO SOMETHING

01:14:39.341 --> 01:14:41.410
THAT IS MASSIVE IT WILL BE A

01:14:41.476 --> 01:14:42.978
GENERATIONAL IT WILL BE --

01:14:43.045 --> 01:14:45.280
SOMETHING THAT WILL BE WITH US

01:14:45.347 --> 01:14:46.215
FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND SO

01:14:46.281 --> 01:14:48.016
THEREFORE CERTAINLY ALL OF US

01:14:48.083 --> 01:14:49.051
HAVE A STAKE IN THIS

01:14:49.117 --> 01:14:51.753
CALIFORNIA'S BUT WE'RE ASKING --

01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:52.421
THINK WITH THIS BILL IS RUNNING

01:14:52.487 --> 01:14:54.256
SUPPORT THIS BILL THAT

01:14:54.323 --> 01:14:56.325
TRANSPARENCY IF YOU KNOW IF IT

01:14:56.391 --> 01:14:57.459
ALLOWS FOR FOLKS HAVE A BETTER

01:14:57.526 --> 01:15:01.430
UNDERSTANDING WITH AGREE OR

01:15:01.496 --> 01:15:01.997
DISAGREE WITH THAT WE THINK

01:15:02.064 --> 01:15:04.766
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

01:15:04.833 --> 01:15:05.834
THE ISSUE IS FOR ME IS I'M

01:15:05.901 --> 01:15:07.903
ALWAYS FOR TRANSPARENCY AND I

01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:09.371
GET IT IT'S IT THAT'S REALLY

01:15:09.438 --> 01:15:11.273
IMPORTANT THE CONCERN I HAVE.

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:14.176
IS -- IS A

01:15:14.243 --> 01:15:17.913
REPORT. FOR REPORTS SAKE WHERE --

01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:19.848
PORCH WE'RE JUST SETTING UP MORE

01:15:19.915 --> 01:15:21.316
AND MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:15:21.383 --> 01:15:24.453
PEOPLE TO BE --

01:15:24.519 --> 01:15:25.520
WHERE THERE'S THERE THERE'S A

01:15:25.587 --> 01:15:27.556
COST EVERY TIME YOU DO --

01:15:27.623 --> 01:15:28.857
ONE OF THESE THINGS AND SO I'M

01:15:28.924 --> 01:15:29.625
NOT SAYING I'M NOT FOR

01:15:29.691 --> 01:15:31.126
TRANSPARENCY I'M JUST TRYING TO

01:15:31.193 --> 01:15:32.160
FIGURE OUT IF YOU'VE GOT ALL OF

01:15:32.227 --> 01:15:34.329
THESE IF YOU'RE DOING A SEQUEL

01:15:34.396 --> 01:15:34.963
YOU'RE DOING ANY BY YOUR YOU'VE

01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:36.265
GOT.

01:15:36.331 --> 01:15:37.900
A JPA THAT'S GOT --

01:15:37.966 --> 01:15:39.568
PUBLIC RESPONSIBILITIES FOR

01:15:39.635 --> 01:15:41.203
REPORTING AND FOR SHARING

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:42.504
INFORMATION AND HAVING PUBLIC

01:15:42.571 --> 01:15:44.306
HEARINGS WHETHER IT WHETHER

01:15:44.373 --> 01:15:46.942
WE'RE ADDING ONE MORE LEVEL --

01:15:47.009 --> 01:15:48.744
THAT THAT DOESN'T GET US TO

01:15:48.810 --> 01:15:49.778
WHERE WE REALLY WANT TO GO AND

01:15:49.845 --> 01:15:51.079
I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

01:15:51.146 --> 01:15:52.247
WHAT'S THE BEST WAY FOR THE

01:15:52.314 --> 01:15:55.284
LEGISLATURE TO GET INFORMATION.

01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:56.752
THAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO

01:15:56.818 --> 01:15:57.819
TALK TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS ABOUT

01:15:57.886 --> 01:15:59.621
IT BECAUSE FRANKLY --

01:15:59.688 --> 01:16:01.323
THE JPA DOES DOESN'T INCLUDE THE

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:03.091
LEGISLATURE LEGISLATORS RIGHT

01:16:03.158 --> 01:16:04.826
AND SO THE INFORMATION THERE

01:16:04.893 --> 01:16:06.295
THEY MAY NOT BE GETTING THE

01:16:06.361 --> 01:16:07.996
INFORMATION THAT PEOPLE ON THE

01:16:08.063 --> 01:16:09.364
GROUND ARE GETTING SO I'M JUST.

01:16:09.431 --> 01:16:13.268
WE HAVE ALREADY IN THE STATE

01:16:13.335 --> 01:16:15.070
THAT PUSHED MULTIPLE.

01:16:15.137 --> 01:16:16.638
ROCKER SEES IF YOU WILL THEY

01:16:16.705 --> 01:16:18.240
DON'T HAVE ANY LEGISLATIVE

01:16:18.307 --> 01:16:21.109
OVERSIGHT AT ALL THIS IS I THINK

01:16:21.176 --> 01:16:22.611
IT'S JUST A STRAIGHT FORWARD.

01:16:22.678 --> 01:16:24.947
RESPONSE --

01:16:25.013 --> 01:16:27.182
TO SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE

01:16:27.249 --> 01:16:28.417
HAVE SEEN THAT HAVE CREATED A

01:16:28.483 --> 01:16:30.686
MAJOR PROBLEMS IN THE AREAS THAT --

01:16:30.752 --> 01:16:33.622
WE REPRESENT AND THEN BEYOND --

01:16:33.689 --> 01:16:34.690
THAT FOR REPAIRS THROUGHOUT THE

01:16:34.756 --> 01:16:37.259
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND FRANKLY

01:16:37.326 --> 01:16:39.194
THE JBL SEE --

01:16:39.261 --> 01:16:42.097
YOUR LAST YEAR AND WHAT THEY DID --

01:16:42.164 --> 01:16:43.031
DEAL WITH THIS.

01:16:43.098 --> 01:16:44.766
IF YOU KNOW THAT PROCESS WORKED

01:16:44.833 --> 01:16:46.868
AND SO WE SAW THIS AS A GOOD

01:16:46.935 --> 01:16:49.871
COMMONSENSE A SITUATION FOR YET

01:16:49.938 --> 01:16:53.141
ANOTHER LEVEL OF REVIEW --

01:16:53.208 --> 01:16:55.143
BY IT THE AREA AND IT'S NOT LIKE

01:16:55.210 --> 01:16:56.511
THEY HAVE VETO POWER IT'S JUST

01:16:56.578 --> 01:17:01.049
GIVING THE LEGISLATURE SOME.

01:17:01.116 --> 01:17:03.452
SORT OF REVIEW.

01:17:03.518 --> 01:17:07.622

WHEN WE GO THROUGH THESE

01:20:31.226 --> 01:20:33.161
PROCESSES WHAT HAPPENS AS WE

01:20:33.228 --> 01:20:35.263

DO THIS BILL CHANGE THAT THAT

01:21:18.373 --> 01:21:19.975
BILL THIS BILL WILL NOT CHANGE

01:21:20.041 --> 01:21:21.443
THAT BUT IT DOES SOMETHING ELSE

01:21:21.509 --> 01:21:22.244
FOR US.

01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:23.678
IN THAT IS.

01:21:23.745 --> 01:21:25.447
THE PROCESSES ARE ALL MATCHING

01:21:25.513 --> 01:21:26.948
UP.

01:21:27.015 --> 01:21:28.316
WHAT IS REVEALED AT THE STATE

01:21:28.383 --> 01:21:29.985
WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD

01:21:30.051 --> 01:21:32.621
ABOUT COSTS DOESN'T MATCH UP

01:21:32.687 --> 01:21:34.022
WITH WHAT YOU SEE IN CONTRACTS?

01:21:34.089 --> 01:21:35.724
DOESN'T MATCH UP WITH WATER

01:21:35.790 --> 01:21:37.492
SUPPLY DECISIONS BEING DISCUSSED

01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:39.261
BY WATER DISTRICTS.

01:21:39.327 --> 01:21:42.397
AND WHAT THIS WOULD ALLOW IS

01:21:42.464 --> 01:21:44.432
SOME OVERSIGHT TIME.

01:21:44.499 --> 01:21:46.268
AT SOME TRANSPARENCY SO THAT

01:21:46.334 --> 01:21:47.936
PEOPLE CAN EVALUATE TO SEE HOW

01:21:48.003 --> 01:21:50.739
THE PIECES ARE FITTING TOGETHER.

01:21:50.805 --> 01:21:52.674
BUT IF THIS BILL DOESN'T RESOLVE

01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:53.842
YOUR PROBLEM WHY DO YOU BRING

01:21:53.908 --> 01:21:57.312
THAT UP AS AN EXAMPLE BECAUSE

01:21:57.379 --> 01:21:59.047
CONTRARY TO WHAT PEOPLE SAY IN

01:21:59.114 --> 01:22:01.916
PEGA SAYS THAT RESTORE THE DELTA.

01:22:01.983 --> 01:22:05.253
WE ARE VERY MUCH CONCERNED ABOUT

01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:07.088
THE ENTIRE PROJECT.

01:22:07.155 --> 01:22:09.424
SERVING PEOPLE WITH AFFORDABLE

01:22:09.491 --> 01:22:12.427
AND RELIABLE WATER AS MUCH AS WE

01:22:12.494 --> 01:22:14.296
ARE ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN.

01:22:14.362 --> 01:22:16.598
WITH IN THE DELTA THIS ISN'T AN

01:22:16.665 --> 01:22:18.700
EITHER OR SITUATION.

01:22:18.767 --> 01:22:22.137
WE HAVE TO GET IT RIGHT.

01:22:22.203 --> 01:22:23.972
ADD TO GET IT RIGHT YOU HAVE TO

01:22:24.039 --> 01:22:25.173
UNDERSTAND.

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:28.310
WATER SUPPLY WATER DELIVERY AND

01:22:28.376 --> 01:22:30.578
COSTS AND RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO

01:22:30.645 --> 01:22:32.347
WAY TO EVALUATE ALL THOSE PIECES

01:22:32.414 --> 01:22:36.785
TOGETHER.

01:22:36.851 --> 01:22:38.920
WELL THERE'S A WAY IF WE TAKE

01:22:38.987 --> 01:22:40.522
THE INITIATIVE TO EVALUATE ALL

01:22:40.588 --> 01:22:42.657
THOSE PIECES TOGETHER.

01:22:42.724 --> 01:22:44.392
DOES THIS BILL.

01:22:44.459 --> 01:22:45.160
REQUIRE THAT THEY'LL BE

01:22:45.226 --> 01:22:47.295
EVALUATED TOGETHER.

01:22:47.362 --> 01:22:51.166
IT HELPS THE PROCESS IT'S NOT ITDOESN'T REQUIRED EITHER SO IT

01:22:51.232 --> 01:22:53.268
DOESN'T ISN'T NECESSARILY GONNA.

01:22:53.335 --> 01:22:56.304
CONTRIBUTOR THAT EITHER.

01:22:56.371 --> 01:22:57.539
RIGHT IT HELPS THE PROCESS

[inaudible]

01:22:58.340 --> 01:23:01.309
OKAY.

01:23:01.376 --> 01:23:02.210

01:23:02.277 --> 01:23:04.179
WHAT WE'RE IF WE'RE GOING TO GET

01:23:04.245 --> 01:23:05.347
TO A SOLUTION WE BETTER START

01:23:05.413 --> 01:23:07.282
WORKING ON IT.

01:23:07.349 --> 01:23:10.385
ANNA AND I WOULD RATHER SEE.

01:23:10.452 --> 01:23:12.620

THIS IS WHERE ALL OUR EFFORTS I

01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:17.425

IN ANALOGY WANNA USE FOR THAT.

01:23:31.139 --> 01:23:32.340
I MEAN THIS IS KIND OF AN

01:23:32.407 --> 01:23:34.008
EXAMPLE THAT I HATE TO BE PART

01:23:34.075 --> 01:23:35.710

01:31:47.235 --> 01:31:50.004
LOOK AT THOSE.

01:31:50.071 --> 01:31:51.072

01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:00.681
WHAT'S A MEANINGFUL KIND OF

01:32:00.748 --> 01:32:02.984
TRANSPARENCY FOR US TO HAVE HOW

01:32:03.050 --> 01:32:04.151

STACK OF HUNDREDS OF CONTRACTS

01:32:11.292 --> 01:32:12.159
IS THAT ACTUALLY GOING TO BE

01:32:12.226 --> 01:32:14.228
USEFUL TO THE JAIL BC TO DO

01:32:14.295 --> 01:32:14.662

THE QUESTION IS THIS THIS IS ONE

01:32:26.374 --> 01:32:27.842
OF THESE AREAS I THINK.

01:32:27.909 --> 01:32:30.344

STATUTORY DELAY IN THE TIME LINE

01:33:15.589 --> 01:33:17.058
WHEN THERE MIGHT NOT BE A NEED

I DON'T KNOW A CENTER DOT I MEAN.

01:33:41.048 --> 01:33:43.284
THERE IS LEGITIMACY TO THE

01:33:43.351 --> 01:33:45.820
LARGER ARGUMENT IN MY JUDGMENT

01:33:45.886 --> 01:33:47.188
THAT THERE HAS BEEN ATTENTION.

01:33:47.254 --> 01:33:48.456
AND THAT THERE'S ALWAYS

01:33:48.522 --> 01:33:50.191
SUSPICION ON BOTH SIDES JUST THE

01:33:50.257 --> 01:33:50.891
WAY IT IS.

01:33:50.958 --> 01:33:53.294
QUESTION IS HOW CAN YOU ACHIEVE

01:33:53.361 --> 01:33:55.162
THE OBJECTIVE THAT YOU WANT TO

01:33:55.229 --> 01:33:57.064
ACHIEVE AND AVOID THAT SUSPICION.

01:33:57.131 --> 01:33:58.265
THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET TO

01:33:58.332 --> 01:33:58.733
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN

01:33:58.799 --> 01:33:59.300

OKAY THANK YOU FOR THOSE

01:34:02.770 --> 01:34:04.105
COMMENTS CENTER ERTZBERG SENATE

JACKSON DID YOU HAVE A COMMENT

01:34:04.772 --> 01:34:07.708
QUESTION.

01:34:07.775 --> 01:34:09.810
I APOLOGIZE SAID.

01:34:09.877 --> 01:34:10.945
I WASN'T ABLE TO BE HERE AS

01:34:11.012 --> 01:34:12.880
BEING PUT THROUGH MY PACES IN

01:34:12.947 --> 01:34:16.350
SENATOR DODD'S COMMITTEE --

01:34:16.417 --> 01:34:18.319
SO -- I I

01:34:18.386 --> 01:34:19.920
GUESS [inaudible]

01:34:19.987 --> 01:34:21.188
THE ISSUE.

01:34:21.255 --> 01:34:22.556
ARE THE ARE SENSIBLE ISSUE IS

01:34:22.623 --> 01:34:24.225
ONE OF TRANSPARENCY.

01:34:24.291 --> 01:34:26.727
BUT THERE'S MORE TO THIS --

01:34:26.794 --> 01:34:28.696
AND SO I WOULD LIKE --

01:34:28.763 --> 01:34:30.931
IF SOMEONE COULD SHARE WHAT THE

01:34:30.998 --> 01:34:33.034
CONCERN IS BEYOND THE

01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:34.235
TRANSPARENCY IS.

01:34:34.301 --> 01:34:36.103
THE CENTER HERTZBERG INDICATED

01:34:36.170 --> 01:34:37.838
YOU KNOW NOBODY TRUSTS ANYBODY.

01:34:37.905 --> 01:34:38.606
I THINK THAT'S A FOR STATEMENT

01:34:38.672 --> 01:34:40.508
WHETHER THERE'S HISTORICAL BASIS

01:34:40.574 --> 01:34:42.743
FOR THAT ARE JUST IS IT IS THE

01:34:42.810 --> 01:34:44.145
WAY IT IS.

01:34:44.211 --> 01:34:47.181
WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT WHAT IS

01:34:47.248 --> 01:34:48.916
THE UNDERLYING REASON?

01:34:48.983 --> 01:34:51.419
THAT YOU'RE HERE SEEKING THIS

01:34:51.485 --> 01:34:53.621
TRANSPARENCY OR OR NG TO SEEK

01:34:53.687 --> 01:34:54.855
THIS TRANSPARENCY THAT OTHERS

01:34:54.922 --> 01:34:56.323
ARE SAYING NO.

01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:57.925
WE NEED TO DO IT IN A DIFFERENT

01:34:57.992 --> 01:34:59.894
WAY AT THE END OF THE DAY WHAT

01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:01.462
IS THE WHAT IS THE ULTIMATE

01:35:01.529 --> 01:35:03.531
CONSEQUENCE OF HOW AND WHETHER

01:35:03.597 --> 01:35:05.099
WE WILL ACHIEVE THAT

01:35:05.166 --> 01:35:08.502
TRANSPARENCY.

01:35:08.569 --> 01:35:11.939
GREATEST CONCERN ON WHEN YOU.

01:35:12.006 --> 01:35:12.606
LOOK AT THE EVALUATION OF STATE

01:35:12.673 --> 01:35:16.310
WATER CONTRACT IS THAT THE WATER

01:35:16.377 --> 01:35:18.312
DELIVERIES.

01:35:18.379 --> 01:35:20.314
HAVE TO BE CERTAIN TO BE THERE

01:35:20.381 --> 01:35:22.183
FOR THE BOND REPAYMENTS CAN

01:35:22.249 --> 01:35:24.118
EVENTUALLY BE MADE.

01:35:24.185 --> 01:35:25.853
THE CONTRACTS REVEAL.

01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:27.221
THE WATER DELIVERIES AND THE

01:35:27.288 --> 01:35:29.423
ALLOTMENTS.

01:35:29.490 --> 01:35:30.491
IN ADDITION TO WHAT IS NORMALLY

01:35:30.558 --> 01:35:33.694
LOOKED AT AS FAR AS REVENUES.

01:35:33.761 --> 01:35:35.196
AND SO WHEN OF WHEN A CONTRACT

01:35:35.262 --> 01:35:37.331
COMES IN THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME

01:35:37.398 --> 01:35:37.865
TIME.

01:35:37.932 --> 01:35:41.502
AREN'T WE BELIEVE FOR US TO WORK

01:35:41.569 --> 01:35:42.770
WITH THE LEGISLATURE.

01:35:42.837 --> 01:35:44.705
SO THAT THEY CAN ASK THE MEANING

01:35:44.772 --> 01:35:46.941
FOR QUESTIONS --

01:35:47.007 --> 01:35:49.477
OF THE CONTRACT [inaudible]

01:35:49.543 --> 01:35:53.447
BECAUSE UNLESS THESE CONTRACTS

01:35:53.514 --> 01:35:54.181
ARE.

01:35:54.248 --> 01:35:56.484
APPROPRIATE AND MEANINGFUL WE

01:35:56.550 --> 01:35:58.586
WON'T BE REPAYING THE BOND.

01:35:58.652 --> 01:36:01.455
IS AND AND SO WHY ARE THE FOLKS

01:36:01.522 --> 01:36:03.257
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

01:36:03.324 --> 01:36:05.626
NOT HAPPY WITH THIS BILL BUT YOU

01:36:05.693 --> 01:36:07.328
FEEL YOU NEED TO BRING THIS BILL.

01:36:07.394 --> 01:36:09.263
ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE IN YOUR

01:36:09.330 --> 01:36:11.799
COMMUNITY.

01:36:11.866 --> 01:36:13.934
WELL I FIGURED IT LIVES UP THE

01:36:14.001 --> 01:36:16.370
COST WITH THE WATER DELIVERS

01:36:16.437 --> 01:36:17.404
ASKS -- SHE

01:36:17.471 --> 01:36:18.372
IS -- I

01:36:18.439 --> 01:36:19.006
DISCUSSED.

01:36:19.073 --> 01:36:20.608
AND I THINK IT'S NOT ONLY FOR

01:36:20.674 --> 01:36:22.276
THE REPRESENTATIVES THAT

01:36:22.343 --> 01:36:24.311
REPRESENT THE DELTA AREAS.

01:36:24.378 --> 01:36:25.312
I THINK THIS IS EQUALLY

01:36:25.379 --> 01:36:28.516
IMPORTANT FOR LET'S SAID JULES

01:36:28.582 --> 01:36:30.618
AND MODERATE SEEING DIEGO IN THE

01:36:30.684 --> 01:36:32.186
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. TO

01:36:32.253 --> 01:36:34.455
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE COSTS THAT

01:36:34.522 --> 01:36:36.524
WATER IS SO WHEN THOSE RATES DO

01:36:36.590 --> 01:36:37.658
GO OUT FOR THIS PARTICULAR

01:36:37.725 --> 01:36:39.260
PROCESS.

01:36:39.326 --> 01:36:41.262
THAT EITHER THE LEGISLATURE

01:36:41.328 --> 01:36:43.130
KNOWS AND UNDERSTANDS --

01:36:43.197 --> 01:36:45.132
EACH YEAH THAT IT CAN GET

01:36:45.199 --> 01:36:47.601
REPRESENT ADEQUATELY REPRESENT.

01:36:47.668 --> 01:36:49.436
YOU ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS SO

01:36:49.503 --> 01:36:51.205
THERE'S A CONCERN THAT THE

01:36:51.272 --> 01:36:52.439
INFORMATION IS NOT BEING

01:36:52.506 --> 01:36:55.309
ACCURATELY RELAYED TO THE RATE

01:36:55.376 --> 01:36:57.478
PAYERS.

01:36:57.545 --> 01:36:59.079
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

01:36:59.146 --> 01:37:02.216
I THINK EVERYWHERE FRANKLY IS IS

01:37:02.283 --> 01:37:04.985
THE IS A DETERMINATION THAT --

01:37:05.052 --> 01:37:06.287
THE THAT HAS BEEN MADE.

01:37:06.353 --> 01:37:07.988
BUT I THINK IT'S EQUALLY

01:37:08.055 --> 01:37:09.290
IMPORTANT TO TAT --

01:37:09.356 --> 01:37:12.660
THE OLD.

01:37:12.726 --> 01:37:14.328
AT THE END OF THE DAY THERE IS

01:37:14.395 --> 01:37:16.363
RISK AND REWARDS IN EVERY

01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:17.698
PROJECT.

01:37:17.765 --> 01:37:20.434
AND I THINK THIS REALLY ALLOWS.

01:37:20.501 --> 01:37:22.269
THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND.

01:37:22.336 --> 01:37:24.004
INTO A COMPREHENSIVE WAY THE

01:37:24.071 --> 01:37:25.606
RISK AND REWARDS.

01:37:25.673 --> 01:37:28.342
OF SUCH A PROJECT TO NOT ONLY

01:37:28.409 --> 01:37:30.344
THE BROADER STATE --

01:37:30.411 --> 01:37:32.313
MOVING FORWARD BUT ALSO TO THOSE

01:37:32.379 --> 01:37:33.414
THAT ARE --

01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:35.382
INTIMATELY IMPACTED IN THE DELTA

01:37:35.449 --> 01:37:37.284
REGION.

01:37:37.351 --> 01:37:39.453
AND SO YOU YOU'RE ASSUMING THAT

01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:41.088
IF ALL THIS INFORMATION WERE

01:37:41.155 --> 01:37:42.856
MADE KNOWN.

01:37:42.923 --> 01:37:45.793
THAT THE THAT THE COST WELL IT

01:37:45.859 --> 01:37:47.595
WHAT YOU WOULD PERCEIVE IS

01:37:47.661 --> 01:37:50.231
LIKELY PROHIBITIVE WOULD BE MADE

01:37:50.297 --> 01:37:51.398
KNOWN TO THE PEOPLE IN SOUTHERN

01:37:51.465 --> 01:37:53.000
CALIFORNIA SO THAT THEY WOULD

01:37:53.067 --> 01:37:55.102
NOT WANT TO CONTINUE WITH THE

01:37:55.169 --> 01:37:58.105
PROJECT OR PROMOTE THE PROJECT

01:37:58.172 --> 01:38:00.174
BECAUSE THE COST IS TOO GREAT.

01:38:00.241 --> 01:38:01.408
I WOULDN'T MAKE THAT IT

01:38:01.475 --> 01:38:03.410
PRESUMPTION I WOULD ASSUME THAT

01:38:03.477 --> 01:38:06.247
THE PUBLIC HAS THE RIGHT TO KNOW.

01:38:06.313 --> 01:38:08.215
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS

01:38:08.282 --> 01:38:08.849
RECEIVING FOR THE MONEY THAT'S

01:38:08.916 --> 01:38:09.984
SPENT.

01:38:10.050 --> 01:38:11.318
EVEN A SINGLE TUNNEL PROJECT

01:38:11.385 --> 01:38:13.053
WILL BECOME.

01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:14.955
WITH COST OVERRUNS INTEREST

01:38:15.022 --> 01:38:17.157
REPAYMENTS AND BOND THAT --

01:38:17.224 --> 01:38:20.060
AND AND OPERATIONS THE SECOND

01:38:20.127 --> 01:38:21.862
LARGEST OR SECOND MOST EXPENSIVE

01:38:21.929 --> 01:38:23.130
PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT IN

01:38:23.197 --> 01:38:24.365
CALIFORNIA.

01:38:24.431 --> 01:38:27.067
AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHAT WAS

01:38:27.134 --> 01:38:28.035
RELATED TO RATE PAYERS AND

01:38:28.102 --> 01:38:30.271
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DOESN'T

01:38:30.337 --> 01:38:32.306
MATCH WATER BOARD TESTIMONY.

01:38:32.373 --> 01:38:35.743
AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS.

01:38:35.809 --> 01:38:37.344
THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE AND JUST

01:38:37.411 --> 01:38:39.179
A SMALL AMOUNT OF TIME.

01:38:39.246 --> 01:38:41.649
HOW DOES THAT CONTRACT MATCH UP

01:38:41.715 --> 01:38:43.250
WITH THESE OTHER PROCESSES SO

01:38:43.317 --> 01:38:45.019
THAT WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE GETTING

01:38:45.085 --> 01:38:46.287
FOR WHAT WE'RE PAYING?

01:38:46.353 --> 01:38:47.788
SO THROUGH THE CHAIR COULD WE

01:38:47.855 --> 01:38:49.123
HAVE.

01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:50.224
A GOOD ONE OF THOSE IN

01:38:50.291 --> 01:38:53.427
OPPOSITION TO THIS.

01:38:53.494 --> 01:38:54.528

01:38:57.164 --> 01:38:58.632
TRYING TO THEIR WITH WATER

01:38:58.699 --> 01:39:01.502
THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING MORE

01:39:01.568 --> 01:39:03.437
THAN WHAT'S ON THE SURFACE.

01:39:03.504 --> 01:39:05.339
THAT I I'M JAY WATER CONTRACTORS

01:39:05.406 --> 01:39:07.875

IT'S SHOCKING SHOCKING I AM I AM

01:39:09.743 --> 01:39:13.547
SHOCKED THE PERSPECTIVE IS OF

01:39:13.614 --> 01:39:15.282
WHAT UNDER THE SURFACE.

01:39:15.349 --> 01:39:17.384
FROM THE FOLKS WHO OPPOSE THIS

01:39:17.451 --> 01:39:17.918
BILL.

01:39:17.985 --> 01:39:19.286
GOOD MORNING I'M JENNIFER PAIR

01:39:23.223 --> 01:39:24.158
ABOUT OUR FOR THROUGH THE DESIGN

01:39:24.224 --> 01:39:25.492
AND CONSTRUCTION AUTHORITY THEY

01:39:25.559 --> 01:39:27.161
ONLY DEAL WITH DESIGN AND

01:39:27.227 --> 01:39:28.962
CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES AND NOT

01:39:29.029 --> 01:39:30.564
AGENCY WOULD ACTUALLY BE SUNSET

01:39:30.631 --> 01:39:31.732
IT AT WHEN THE CAR WATER FIXES

01:39:31.799 --> 01:39:32.900
THAN BEING CONSTRUCTED.

01:39:32.966 --> 01:39:34.335
THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE

01:39:34.401 --> 01:39:35.636
WATER SUPPLY CONTRACT OR HOW

01:39:35.703 --> 01:39:37.371
WATER IS DELIVERED OR WHEN IT'S

01:39:37.438 --> 01:39:39.306
OPERATED OR HOW IT'S OPERATED

01:39:39.373 --> 01:39:41.375
IT'S LITERALLY JUST AN AGENCY TO

01:39:41.442 --> 01:39:42.109
DESIGN AND CONSTRUCT.

01:39:42.176 --> 01:39:44.011
THE PROJECT AND IN A PUBLIC WAY

01:39:44.078 --> 01:39:45.612
WITH A PUBLIC BOARD SO THAT IT

01:39:45.679 --> 01:39:49.450
CAN PROVIDE MORE TRANSPARENCY.

01:39:49.516 --> 01:39:50.351
SECOND I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT

01:39:50.417 --> 01:39:51.585

DELAY ISSUE THIS IS A MULTI

01:39:53.987 --> 01:39:55.756
BILLION DOLLAR PROJECT.

01:39:55.823 --> 01:39:58.025
PROBABLY EVEN WITH ONE TUNNEL.

01:39:58.092 --> 01:39:59.226
AND AT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR

01:39:59.293 --> 01:40:00.861
INCREMENTS THAT IS GOING TO BE

01:40:00.928 --> 01:40:03.497

BRINGING THAT IN FRONT OF YOU

01:40:04.665 --> 01:40:05.999
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE SUGGESTING

01:40:06.066 --> 01:40:07.334
THAT INSTEAD OF DOING.

01:40:07.401 --> 01:40:10.204

01:40:13.307 --> 01:40:15.275
IT DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT SEEMS AS

01:40:15.342 --> 01:40:18.245
PURPOSE THOUGHT IS TO MARRY THE

01:40:18.312 --> 01:40:19.446
TOTALITY OF THE ACTIVITIES GOING

AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT

01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:29.156
AND THE GPA REQUIRES THAT WHEN

01:40:29.223 --> 01:40:32.726
THERE IS A 5% INCREASE IN BUDGET.

01:40:32.793 --> 01:40:34.228
OR MORE THAN A SIX MONTH DELAY

MAKE IS THAT WHEN THERE ARE

01:40:42.236 --> 01:40:43.804
CHANGES THAT OCCUR MORE THAN

01:40:43.871 --> 01:40:45.906

TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE JAIL BC

01:41:13.267 --> 01:41:14.802
UNDER THE CURRENT LANGUAGE WOULD

01:41:14.868 --> 01:41:16.703
INCLUDE WATER SUPPLY YOUR

01:41:16.770 --> 01:41:17.838

SAYS PLANNING DESIGN --

01:41:24.611 --> 01:41:26.146
IN CONSTRUCTION I BELIEVE IN THE

01:41:26.213 --> 01:41:27.414
NATURE THE CONTRACTUAL

01:41:27.481 --> 01:41:29.550
AGREEMENTS SO FOR THE RECORD I I

MAYBE NOT SUBSTANTIVELY BECAUSE

01:41:36.457 --> 01:41:37.658
I DON'T THINK WE CAN HAVE THAT.

01:41:37.724 --> 01:41:39.860
BROADER SUBSTANTIVE DEBATE TODAY

01:41:39.927 --> 01:41:40.561
AT LEAST IN THE CONFINES OF THIS

01:41:40.627 --> 01:41:44.965
BILL BUT THOUGHTS ON THIS THIS

01:41:45.032 --> 01:41:48.402
CONCEPT OF THE THE VALUE OF AN

01:41:48.469 --> 01:41:49.870
ANNUAL BUDGET.

01:41:49.937 --> 01:41:51.772
AND THEN USING THESE ARE PUBLIC

01:41:51.839 --> 01:41:53.307
THAT THE CONTRACTS ARE PUBLIC

01:41:53.373 --> 01:41:54.208
DOCUMENTS RIGHT IS SO WHAT

01:41:54.274 --> 01:41:56.743
THEY'RE ALL ACCESSIBLE PUBLICLY

01:41:56.810 --> 01:41:57.511
TO JUST WANT TO GET YOUR

01:41:57.578 --> 01:41:59.379
PERSPECTIVE.

01:41:59.446 --> 01:42:00.214
ON THIS WHICH SOUNDS LIKE A

01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:03.350
REASON NO BUDGET BOTH IN DRAFT

01:42:03.417 --> 01:42:05.052
FORM.

01:42:05.118 --> 01:42:06.286
AS WELL AS A FINAL BUDGET.

01:42:06.353 --> 01:42:10.057
AND TO TO MAKE THAT THE ITEM

01:42:10.123 --> 01:42:11.625
THAT'S EITHER SUBMITTED TO THE

01:42:11.692 --> 01:42:13.927
JAIL BC OR THAT WE YOU KNOW WE

01:42:13.994 --> 01:42:15.696
HAVE A WATER COMMISSION SET UP

01:42:15.762 --> 01:42:17.464
TO BY THE WAY IN ADDITION TO THE

01:42:17.531 --> 01:42:18.899
TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT.

01:42:18.966 --> 01:42:19.900
THAT -- DOES

01:42:19.967 --> 01:42:20.567
THE ANNUAL REVIEW OF

01:42:20.634 --> 01:42:22.269
CONSTRUCTION OPERATION OF THE

01:42:22.336 --> 01:42:25.205
ENTIRE SYSTEM SO.

01:42:25.272 --> 01:42:27.007
I'M I'M INTERESTED IN IN TRYING

01:42:27.074 --> 01:42:28.208

THAT MIGHT ACHIEVE YOUR PURPOSES

01:42:29.743 --> 01:42:31.979
WITHOUT --

01:42:32.045 --> 01:42:33.580
PUTTING FOR DOCUMENTS THAT

01:42:33.647 --> 01:42:35.516
FRANKLY WE ARE GOING TO BE THAT

01:42:35.582 --> 01:42:36.817
MEANINGFUL TO US IF WE'RE

01:42:36.884 --> 01:42:38.585
EVALUATING HOW THE PROJECTS

01:42:38.652 --> 01:42:39.686
GOING SO.

01:42:39.753 --> 01:42:41.622
THOUGHTS ON THE DRAFT ANNUAL

01:42:41.688 --> 01:42:42.322
LIKE SORT OF THE BUDGET

01:42:42.389 --> 01:42:43.323
SUBMISSION.

01:42:43.390 --> 01:42:45.692
YEAH WELL I I GUESS WHAT I'D

01:42:45.759 --> 01:42:46.093
HAVE TO SAY IS --

01:42:46.159 --> 01:42:49.029
IT -- THEY

01:42:49.096 --> 01:42:50.531
MAY NOT BE THEY MAY NOT BE

01:42:50.597 --> 01:42:52.266
IMPORTANT AS IT'S BEEN PRESENTED

01:42:52.332 --> 01:42:53.634
HERE TODAY.

01:42:53.700 --> 01:42:55.369
BUT IT WILL WHAT THEY MAY DO IS

01:42:55.435 --> 01:42:58.539
THEY MAY TELL THE WHOLE STORY.

01:42:58.605 --> 01:43:00.574
SO TO SPEAK AND LET ME JUST SAY.

01:43:00.641 --> 01:43:01.942
THAT -- THE

01:43:02.009 --> 01:43:03.176
IDEA THAT --

01:43:03.243 --> 01:43:05.145
THERE THIS IS BEEN AN OPEN AND

01:43:05.212 --> 01:43:07.514
TRANSPARENT PROCESS FOR THE LAST

01:43:07.581 --> 01:43:08.916
TEN YEARS.

01:43:08.982 --> 01:43:10.751
HE IS -- HE

01:43:10.817 --> 01:43:12.252
FRANKLY RIDICULOUS.

01:43:12.319 --> 01:43:13.353
AND THIS IS THE REASON WHY WE'RE

01:43:13.420 --> 01:43:16.423
HERE -- I

01:43:16.490 --> 01:43:18.425
WOULD SUGGEST THAT --

01:43:18.492 --> 01:43:21.428
IT WE I AM CERTAINLY OPEN.

01:43:21.495 --> 01:43:23.297
THE EYES THE SENATOR INDICATED --

01:43:23.363 --> 01:43:25.232
THAT I THINK THAT'S MY MODUS

01:43:25.299 --> 01:43:27.267
OPERANDI IS TO WORK WITH PEOPLE

01:43:27.334 --> 01:43:27.601
TO TRY.

01:43:27.668 --> 01:43:28.569
TO YOU KNOW CRAFT.

01:43:28.635 --> 01:43:30.637
BETTER SOLUTIONS TO DIFFICULT

01:43:30.704 --> 01:43:31.939
PROBLEMS.

01:43:32.005 --> 01:43:34.841
I I HAVEN'T HEARD ONE HERE TODAY

01:43:34.908 --> 01:43:36.476
IN THIS HEARING YET THAT --

01:43:36.543 --> 01:43:38.211
THAT MOVES ME BUT I'M OPEN TO

01:43:38.278 --> 01:43:41.181
DISCUSSING THIS WITH THE THE

01:43:41.248 --> 01:43:43.984
OPPONENTS OF IT MOVING FORWARD --

01:43:44.051 --> 01:43:45.419
YEAH THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE MY

01:43:45.485 --> 01:43:48.322
REQUEST PRIOR TO MOVING THE BILL

01:43:48.388 --> 01:43:48.589
TODAY --

01:43:48.655 --> 01:43:50.390
WITH THE AMENDMENTS IS.

01:43:50.457 --> 01:43:53.260
IS JUST THAT COMMITMENT I THINK.

01:43:53.327 --> 01:43:54.361
OPPONENTS HAVE AN INTERESTING

01:43:54.428 --> 01:43:55.996
CONCEPT FOR AN AMENDMENT.

01:43:56.063 --> 01:43:58.131
ABOUT USING THE THE ANNUAL

01:43:58.198 --> 01:44:00.167
BUDGET AS THIS SORT OF DRIVING

01:44:00.233 --> 01:44:01.201
DOCUMENT.

01:44:01.268 --> 01:44:02.436
LIKE I SAID WATER COMMISSION

01:44:02.502 --> 01:44:03.737
THERE MAY BE OTHER WAYS THERE

THIN.

01:45:26.286 --> 01:45:27.921
MY POINT IS THAT NOW YOU'VE

TAKEN THESE AMENDMENTS.

01:45:30.057 --> 01:45:30.924
IF YOU THINK THROUGH EUROPE

AS SOON --

01:45:40.534 --> 01:45:41.802
TRYING TO CATCH UP WITH THE EVER

01:45:41.868 --> 01:45:43.303
VOTE AGAINST THE DOT BILL

01:45:43.370 --> 01:45:45.172
BECAUSE THEY VOTE AGAINST FAMILY

01:45:45.238 --> 01:45:45.939
BUT TO BRING IT BACK TO

01:45:46.006 --> 01:45:48.075
COMMITTEE. TO BRING IT BACK TO

01:45:48.141 --> 01:45:50.077
COMMITTEE THAT WE'LL WE'LL MAKE

01:45:50.143 --> 01:45:52.979
SURE THAT THIS IS. THREE THOUGHT

01:45:53.046 --> 01:45:55.248
THROUGH CONSISTENT WITH THE I

01:45:55.315 --> 01:45:58.151
THINK IT'S REALLY HAS CHANGED.

01:45:58.218 --> 01:45:59.920
OF FUNDAMENTALLY WHAT YOUR

01:45:59.986 --> 01:46:01.254
ORIGINAL.

01:46:01.321 --> 01:46:03.457
INITIATIVE WAS WITH RESPECT TO

THE CONTENTS OF THE MEASURE.

01:46:05.025 --> 01:46:05.792
YOU KNOW IT'S A WHETHER IT'S A

BUDGET PROCESS OR SOMETHING ELSE

01:46:08.295 --> 01:46:10.130
BUT THE NOTION IS TRANSPARENCY

01:46:10.197 --> 01:46:11.665
WITHOUT DELAY I THINK THAT'S THE

01:46:11.732 --> 01:46:13.100
MESSAGE THAT WE'RE ALL TRYING TO

01:46:13.166 --> 01:46:13.934
