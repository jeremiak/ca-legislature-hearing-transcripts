CREATING LIFE SAVING MEDICATIONS

00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:05.591
THE PRACTICE OF PAY FOR DELAY IS

00:07:05.658 --> 00:07:06.659
ALREADY ILLEGAL UNDER ANTI

00:07:10.997 --> 00:07:12.565
WHAT AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR DOES

00:07:12.632 --> 00:07:14.634
IS TO SHIFT THE BURDEN OF PROOF

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:15.701

THESE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS ARE

00:07:21.007 --> 00:07:22.375

FOUR BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY BY

00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:25.491
THE USE OF GENERIC DRUGS.

00:15:25.557 --> 00:15:26.792
AIMS CONCERN AT THE WAY THAT THE

00:15:26.859 --> 00:15:28.427
BILL AS DRAFTED IS NOT ONLY

00:15:28.494 --> 00:15:29.428

SAVING PATIENTS MONEY.

00:15:32.264 --> 00:15:33.265
BUT IT COULD ALSO TAKE SOME

00:15:33.332 --> 00:15:35.200
GENERIC OFF THE MARKET IF THE

00:15:35.267 --> 00:15:36.235
PROVISIONS OF THOSE PRIOR

00:15:36.302 --> 00:15:37.603
SETTLEMENTS ARE NOW CALLED INTO

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:40.306
QUESTION AND UNDER LEGAL THREAT

00:15:40.372 --> 00:15:41.740
IN CALIFORNIA.

00:15:41.807 --> 00:15:43.442
A TYPICAL CASE IT'S THE BRAND

00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:45.511
MANUFACTURER WHOSE FILING SUIT

00:15:45.577 --> 00:15:47.179
AGAINST A GENERIC MANUFACTURER

00:15:47.246 --> 00:15:49.415
WHO'S TRYING TO ATTACK THE

00:15:49.481 --> 00:15:51.216
PATENT TICKET THAT HAS BEEN

00:15:51.283 --> 00:15:52.751
TYPICALLY ESTABLISHED BY THE

00:15:52.818 --> 00:15:55.220
BRAND COMPANIES IN ORDER TO

00:15:55.287 --> 00:15:56.388
PROTECT THEIR MONOPOLIES.

00:15:56.455 --> 00:15:58.290
SETTLEMENTS HAVE PROVEN TO SAVE

00:15:58.357 --> 00:15:59.892
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.795
THE RECENT CASE OF EXAMPLE OF

00:16:02.861 --> 00:16:04.630
THAT IS HIS HUMOR.

00:16:04.697 --> 00:16:05.564
SO WITH THE WORLD'S BEST SELLING

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:06.665
DRUGS WHEN THE TOP GROSSING

00:16:06.732 --> 00:16:08.567
DRUGS ON THE MARKET SINCE TWO

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:10.569
THOUSAND AND TWO IN TWENTY

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:11.770
SIXTEEN ALONE MEDICARE MEDICAID

00:16:11.837 --> 00:16:14.473
PAID OVER THREE POINT THREE

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.608
BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE STRUCK.

00:16:16.675 --> 00:16:17.810
PATENTS WOULD DELAY GENERIC

00:16:17.876 --> 00:16:20.012
COMPETITION UNTIL.

00:16:20.079 --> 00:16:20.546
TWENTY THIRTY FOUR DUE TO

00:16:20.612 --> 00:16:22.181
SETTLEMENTS THIS DRUG IS NOW

00:16:22.247 --> 00:16:24.016
GOING TO BE AVAILABLE IN ABOUT

00:16:24.083 --> 00:16:26.985
SIMILAR FORM IN. TWENTY TWENTY

00:16:27.052 --> 00:16:28.220
THREE EVEN THOUGH THIS IS ELEVEN

00:16:28.287 --> 00:16:29.455
FULL YEARS BEFORE PATENT

00:16:29.521 --> 00:16:31.056
EXPIRATION.

00:16:31.123 --> 00:16:33.726
THIS DRUG NOW COULD NOT THE

00:16:33.792 --> 00:16:36.261
POTENTIALLY COULD COULD HAVE A

00:16:36.328 --> 00:16:38.564
DELAY IN COMING TO MARKET EVEN

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:39.965
THOUGH THE AGREEMENTS.

00:16:40.032 --> 00:16:41.233
HAVE ESTABLISHED IT AT THAT

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.868
PERIOD.

00:16:42.935 --> 00:16:44.670
BECAUSE AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR

00:16:44.737 --> 00:16:47.039
ASSUMES THAT EVERY SETTLEMENT IS.

00:16:47.106 --> 00:16:48.807
ANTI COMPETITIVE IT'S A

00:16:48.874 --> 00:16:50.142
PRESUMPTION THAT THE

00:16:50.209 --> 00:16:52.044
MANUFACTURER MUST COME IN AND

00:16:52.111 --> 00:16:53.545
DEFEAT IN ORDER.

00:16:53.612 --> 00:16:54.780
TO HAVE WON THE SETTLEMENTS THAT

00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:57.316
AGAIN THAT TYPICALLY.

00:16:57.383 --> 00:16:58.984
THE MAIN PROVISION.

00:16:59.051 --> 00:17:00.686
IS TO ALLOW GENERIC COME TO

00:17:00.753 --> 00:17:05.057
MARKET BEFORE PATENT EXPIRATION.

00:17:05.124 --> 00:17:07.960
THIS TYPE OF LEGAL JEOPARDY IT'S

00:17:08.026 --> 00:17:08.794
GOING TO PUT.

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:11.663
GENERIC COMPANIES IN A POSITION

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:13.065
OF HAVING TO DECIDE.

00:17:13.132 --> 00:17:14.333
WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.101
AGGRESSIVELY ATTACK.

00:17:16.168 --> 00:17:18.504
THE BRAND'S PATTON THAT IS THAT

00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:20.472
EXIST.

00:17:20.539 --> 00:17:22.007
THE NUMBER OF PATENTS ON ON

00:17:22.074 --> 00:17:24.843
DRUGS IT HAS GROWN EXPONENTIALLY

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:26.145
OVER THE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL

00:17:26.211 --> 00:17:26.945
YEARS.

00:17:27.012 --> 00:17:29.915
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR A

00:17:29.982 --> 00:17:30.949
EIGHTY DREADED GENERIC TO BE

00:17:31.016 --> 00:17:32.284
ABLE TO DEFEAT EVERY SINGLE

00:17:32.351 --> 00:17:33.852
PATENT IN ORDER TO COME TO

00:17:33.919 --> 00:17:36.388
MARKET IN FACT IF YOU LOSE ONE

00:17:36.455 --> 00:17:39.224
CLAIM OF ONE PARTICULAR PATENT.

00:17:39.291 --> 00:17:41.293
THAT GENERIC IS PRECLUDED AND

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.628
TELL ALL OF THE PATENTS THAT IT

00:17:42.694 --> 00:17:44.897
TRIED TO QUESTION HAVE EXPIRED

00:17:44.963 --> 00:17:46.265
WE'VE SEEN THIS IN THE TAMOXIFEN

00:17:46.331 --> 00:17:47.132
CASE.

00:17:47.199 --> 00:17:49.067
PERFECT EXAMPLE ONE COMPANY

00:17:49.134 --> 00:17:50.536
SETTLED IT WAS ALLOWED TO COME

00:17:50.602 --> 00:17:51.970
TO MARKET FOR NINE YEARS BEFORE

00:17:52.037 --> 00:17:53.338
PATENT EXPIRATION.

00:17:53.405 --> 00:17:55.340
EVERY OTHER COMPANY ARGUE TO

00:17:55.407 --> 00:17:58.243
FINALITY THEY ALL COST.

00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:59.912
ONLY ONE GENERIC HAS BEEN PROVED

00:17:59.978 --> 00:18:01.380
TO BE ABLE TO COME AT THAT TIME

00:18:01.447 --> 00:18:03.315
ON TAMOXIFEN.

00:18:03.382 --> 00:18:05.818
THERE IS A GREAT CONCERN OVER

00:18:05.884 --> 00:18:07.953
THE WAY THAT THE BILL IS DRAFTED

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:09.321
AND SOME OF THE PROVISIONS I

00:18:09.388 --> 00:18:10.422
THANK YOU I KNOW I NEED TO MOVE

00:18:10.489 --> 00:18:11.757
ON AND WHILE SOME OF THE OTHERS

00:18:11.824 --> 00:18:13.225
TO TESTIFY.

00:18:13.292 --> 00:18:14.660
BUT IT JUST OF ONE FINAL POINT

00:18:14.726 --> 00:18:16.028
THERE WAS A SEA CHANGE IN SOME

00:18:16.094 --> 00:18:17.896
OF THE DATA THAT HAS BEEN CITED

00:18:17.963 --> 00:18:19.298
BY THE PROPONENTS THAT OCCURRED

00:18:19.364 --> 00:18:22.835
PRIOR HìNH TWENTY TEN STUDY AN

00:18:22.901 --> 00:18:24.803
FTC STUDY.

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:26.805
THAT'S DATA THAT IS IS PRE

00:18:26.872 --> 00:18:27.739
ACTIVISTS DECISIONS SINCE HE

00:18:27.806 --> 00:18:28.774
ACTIVIST DECISION BY THE US

00:18:28.841 --> 00:18:30.275
SUPREME COURT.

00:18:30.342 --> 00:18:31.810

AND THE STRENGTH OF PATENTS AND

00:23:35.147 --> 00:23:36.181
THE CHALLENGE CHALLENGES THE

00:23:36.248 --> 00:23:38.049
PATENT IN A STRUCTURE THAT'S

00:23:38.116 --> 00:23:40.018
BEEN CREATED IN FEDERAL LAW. TO

00:23:40.085 --> 00:23:41.720
ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE CHALLENGING

00:23:41.787 --> 00:23:44.623
OF THOSE PATENTS AS A WAY -- TO

00:23:44.689 --> 00:23:45.957
TO BRING GENERICS TO MARKET

00:23:46.024 --> 00:23:47.859
BEFORE THE EXPIRATION THE

00:23:50.762 --> 00:23:51.663
THEY ARE GRANTED BY THE PATENT

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:52.597

00:23:52.664 --> 00:23:54.266
APPROVAL FROM THE PATENT OFFICE

00:23:54.332 --> 00:23:58.236

SOME OF THESE PATENTS ARE.

00:24:00.105 --> 00:24:02.574
YEAH PERHAPS NOT AS SOLID IS.

00:24:02.641 --> 00:24:03.909
THEY MAY BE USED AS A WAY TO

00:24:03.975 --> 00:24:05.277
DRIVE AWAY COMPETITION AS WELL

00:24:05.343 --> 00:24:06.478

00:25:34.933 --> 00:25:39.704
UNRECEPTIVE TO ANY EXEMPTION FOR

00:28:11.056 --> 00:28:13.191
I GOT IT THE REASON I BROUGHT UP

00:28:13.258 --> 00:28:14.292
THAT NUMBER.

00:28:14.359 --> 00:28:16.027

CAREER AND I'VE SEEN.

00:28:25.904 --> 00:28:28.106
IN. THIRTY SIX YEARS OF BEING A

00:28:28.173 --> 00:28:29.974

OF LIFESAVING DRUGS.

00:28:38.249 --> 00:28:39.350
AND SO WE WERE TAUGHT IN

00:28:39.417 --> 00:28:40.819
PHARMACY SCHOOL THE DRUG COMPANY

00:28:40.885 --> 00:28:41.653
GOES THROUGH ALL THIS RESEARCH

00:28:41.719 --> 00:28:44.589
INVOLVING THE AT SEVENTEEN YEARS

00:28:44.656 --> 00:28:45.190
OF PROTECTED STATUS WHERE YOU

00:28:45.256 --> 00:28:45.590
CAN.

00:28:45.657 --> 00:28:47.826
YOUR INVESTMENT IN.

00:28:47.892 --> 00:28:49.961
AND HOPEFULLY LIKE MOST -- DRUG

00:28:50.028 --> 00:28:52.497
COMPANIES TO REINVEST THAT MONEY

00:28:52.564 --> 00:28:54.699
TO FIND.

00:28:54.766 --> 00:28:58.303
ETHICAL F. AGO EFFICACY CURES

00:28:58.369 --> 00:28:59.971
FOR DISEASES AS AN EXAMPLE ALL

00:29:00.038 --> 00:29:01.206
USE OF DRUGS OF ALL THE AS AN

00:29:01.272 --> 00:29:02.874
EXAMPLE WE HAVE A CURE. FOR

00:29:02.941 --> 00:29:04.943
HEPATITIS C. -- NOT AN

00:29:05.009 --> 00:29:06.277
INEXPENSIVE DRUG BUT WHEN YOU

00:29:06.344 --> 00:29:07.579
LOOK AT THE ALTERNATIVE OF NOT

00:29:07.645 --> 00:29:08.546
HAVING THE DRUG.

00:29:08.613 --> 00:29:09.514
IT COSTS THE HEALTH SYSTEM IN

00:29:09.581 --> 00:29:11.082
INSURANCE COMPANIES A HECK OF A

00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:15.553
LOT MORE MONEY -- IN DOING LIVER

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:16.054
TRANSPLANTS IT'S CENTRO

00:29:16.121 --> 00:29:16.354
[inaudible]

00:29:16.421 --> 00:29:18.223
SO.

00:29:18.289 --> 00:29:19.691
IT'S ALSO MY UNDERSTANDING

00:29:19.757 --> 00:29:21.192
THROUGH YOUR TESTIMONY.

00:29:21.259 --> 00:29:26.030
THAT AS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN-STATISTICS SHOW THAT THESE.

00:29:26.097 --> 00:29:28.700
ALLEGE DEALS ARE ARE NONEXISTENT

00:29:28.766 --> 00:29:30.435
HOW YOU MADE IT VERY CLEAR TO

00:29:30.502 --> 00:29:33.204
YOUR TESTIMONY AS WELL AND THAT --

00:29:33.271 --> 00:29:35.640
THE TALKS ABOUT -- DEALS THAT

00:29:35.707 --> 00:29:36.174
OCCUR OCCUR IN THE SHADOWS

00:29:36.241 --> 00:29:36.474
[inaudible]

00:29:36.541 --> 00:29:40.145
BUT ALL THESE.

00:29:40.211 --> 00:29:42.881
DEALS HAVE TO BE BROUGHT FORWARD

00:29:42.947 --> 00:29:44.182
TO THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION

00:29:44.249 --> 00:29:45.150
CORRECT.

00:29:45.216 --> 00:29:47.752
THIS IS A TRANSPARENT PROCESS

00:29:47.819 --> 00:29:49.354
NOT ONLY IS A TRANSPARENT.

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:51.289
BUT THEY HAVE TO COMMUNICATE

00:29:51.356 --> 00:29:52.590
THAT TO THE COURTS.

00:29:52.657 --> 00:29:55.627
SO EVEN GUESS HE FURTHER --

00:29:55.693 --> 00:29:57.295
LEGAL REVIEW SO.

00:29:57.362 --> 00:29:58.963
IS THERE AN INCENTIVE FOR A

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:00.798
BRAND NAME COMPANY THAT HAS.

00:30:00.865 --> 00:30:02.333
SEVENTEEN YEARS OF PATENT TO

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.569
WORK OUT A DEAL. TO ALLOW A

00:30:04.636 --> 00:30:06.304
GENERIC TO COME ON EARLIER PRIOR

00:30:06.371 --> 00:30:07.472
TO THE PATENT WHEN THEY ACTUALLY

00:30:07.539 --> 00:30:08.806
COULD TAKE A RIGHT TO THE END OF

00:30:08.873 --> 00:30:09.374
THE SEVENTEEN YEARS I THINK

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.276
THAT'S THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE

00:30:11.342 --> 00:30:13.511
BUSINESS THING -- FOR A COMPANY

00:30:13.578 --> 00:30:14.913
TO DO.

00:30:14.979 --> 00:30:20.718
AND SO -- MY CONCERN HELLO OVER

00:30:20.785 --> 00:30:21.986
THE BILL IS THAT.

00:30:22.053 --> 00:30:23.588
WHAT HAPPENS IF WE GO THROUGH

00:30:23.655 --> 00:30:26.524
THIS PROCESS AND THE FTC FINDS

00:30:26.591 --> 00:30:27.392
THAT?

00:30:27.458 --> 00:30:30.261
THE PROCESS IS PRO COMPETITIVE

00:30:30.328 --> 00:30:30.828
AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:30:30.895 --> 00:30:31.930
FINDS THAT.

00:30:31.996 --> 00:30:33.131
ANTI COMPETITIVE [inaudible]

00:30:33.198 --> 00:30:35.233
THEN.

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:36.668
WHAT WE DO IN A STATEMENT LIKE

00:30:36.734 --> 00:30:38.636
THAT I DON'T KNOW IF THE AUTHOR

00:30:38.703 --> 00:30:39.971
CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION OR?

00:30:40.038 --> 00:30:41.573
ANY OF THE PANELISTS BUT I DON'T

00:30:41.639 --> 00:30:43.241
BELIEVE AND AND AND I CAN ASK

00:30:43.308 --> 00:30:45.510
HER -- ATTORNEYS HERE THAT I

00:30:45.577 --> 00:30:46.911
DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE FTC.

00:30:46.978 --> 00:30:48.346
DECIDES WHETHER SOMETHING IS PRO

00:30:48.413 --> 00:30:49.414
COMPETITIVE OR NOT.

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:50.882
I'M A PART OF THE PROBLEM THAT

00:30:50.949 --> 00:30:52.951
WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE IS

00:30:53.017 --> 00:30:55.553
THAT -- WE HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.121
AS AS SPEAKING FOR THE LIKE THE

00:30:57.188 --> 00:30:58.523
STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR GETTING

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:00.925
INFORMATION -- AND SO WE ARE

00:31:00.992 --> 00:31:03.361
CHANGING THE ASSUMPTION HERE

00:31:03.428 --> 00:31:03.828
WERE SAYING THAT THESE

00:31:03.895 --> 00:31:05.697
AGREEMENTS ARE ARE ARE ANTI

00:31:05.763 --> 00:31:07.665
COMPETITIVE UNTIL YOU CAN PROVE

00:31:07.732 --> 00:31:09.834
THAT THE ART ANTI COMPETITIVE --

00:31:09.901 --> 00:31:11.202
WE AT THAT HAS BEEN A

00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:12.637
FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE FOR THE

00:31:12.704 --> 00:31:13.972
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IS TO

00:31:14.038 --> 00:31:16.040
BE ABLE TO GET THE INFORMATION

00:31:16.107 --> 00:31:16.941
TO REALLY TO REALLY VALUE THAT

00:31:17.008 --> 00:31:18.710
BUT AS FAR AS I'M AWARE THE FTC

00:31:18.776 --> 00:31:20.044
DOES NOT DETERMINE WHETHER

00:31:20.111 --> 00:31:21.813
SOMETHING IS PRO COMPETITIVE --

00:31:21.879 --> 00:31:24.082
ON THE BASIS THAT ONE ON THE WAY

00:31:24.148 --> 00:31:27.919
THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT I THINK OF

00:31:27.986 --> 00:31:28.553
THEIR DIFFERENT AND JEREMY HAVE

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:31.656
A FURTHER CLARIFICATION IN CASE

00:31:31.723 --> 00:31:33.958
I DIDN'T SCREW IT UP TO BAT.

00:31:34.025 --> 00:31:36.127
WELL I JUST WANNA ADAM AND MAKE

00:31:36.194 --> 00:31:36.761
THE RECORD A LITTLE CLEARER NOT

00:31:36.828 --> 00:31:37.729
ALL AGREEMENTS GET REPORTED TO

00:31:37.795 --> 00:31:39.530
THE FTC FOR INSTANCE AGREEMENTS

00:31:39.597 --> 00:31:40.898
INVOLVING BIOLOGICS.

00:31:40.965 --> 00:31:42.533
HAVE NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO BE

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:45.069
REPORTED TO THE FTC AN FTCTHE

00:31:45.136 --> 00:31:47.105
ONLY THING THAT THE FTC GETS IS

00:31:47.171 --> 00:31:48.439
A WRITTEN AGREEMENT.

00:31:48.506 --> 00:31:49.641
AND THE WRITTEN AGREEMENT MAY

00:31:49.707 --> 00:31:50.842
SIMPLY SAY WE GOT NO

00:31:50.908 --> 00:31:52.910
CONSIDERATION THEY DON'T GET ANY

00:31:52.977 --> 00:31:55.380
OTHER EVIDENCE SO WHEN THEY DO

00:31:55.446 --> 00:31:57.081
THEIR REPORT THAT THEY SENT TO

00:31:57.148 --> 00:31:58.516
CONGRESS THEY ARE SIMPLY SAYING

00:31:58.583 --> 00:32:00.952
WE LOOKED AT THE FACE OF THE

00:32:01.019 --> 00:32:01.853
AGREEMENT [inaudible]

00:32:01.919 --> 00:32:03.288
A IT.

00:32:03.354 --> 00:32:04.856
EITHER PASS IT IT LOOKS

00:32:04.922 --> 00:32:06.257
SUSPICIOUS AND THEY HAVE THIS

00:32:06.324 --> 00:32:08.426
NEW BOOK CATEGORY.

00:32:08.493 --> 00:32:10.495
THAT IS GROWING EVERY SINGLE

00:32:10.561 --> 00:32:13.031
YEAR THAT IS 70% INCREASE IN THE

00:32:13.097 --> 00:32:15.199
CATEGORY OF SUSPICIOUS

00:32:15.266 --> 00:32:17.335
AGREEMENTS BETWEEN TWENTY

00:32:17.402 --> 00:32:20.171
FIFTEEN AND TWENTY SIXTEEN AND

00:32:20.238 --> 00:32:21.606
AND THEY DON'T MAKE ANY

00:32:21.673 --> 00:32:23.107
DETERMINATION THEY HAVE

00:32:23.174 --> 00:32:24.242
ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE BEFORE

00:32:24.309 --> 00:32:25.343
THEM OTHER THAN THE AGREEMENT

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:27.178
ITSELF SO THEY NEVER DETERMINE

00:32:27.245 --> 00:32:28.880
WHETHER IT'S PRO COMPETITIVE.

00:32:28.946 --> 00:32:30.715
AS A PRACTICAL MATTER WITH THE

00:32:30.782 --> 00:32:32.817
STATE OFTEN WORKS WITH THE FTC

00:32:32.884 --> 00:32:34.185
WE'RE ONLY GOING TO FOCUS ON

00:32:34.252 --> 00:32:35.586
THOSE CASES THAT ARE THE MOST

00:32:35.653 --> 00:32:39.123
EGREGIOUS AND WE TYPICALLY --

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:41.359
HAVE A HAVING NO DISAGREEMENTS

00:32:41.426 --> 00:32:43.261
WHAT THE FTC I CAN'T IMAGINE

00:32:43.328 --> 00:32:44.696
THAT SITUATION EVER OCCURRING

00:32:44.762 --> 00:32:46.964
THESE CASES ARE SO HARD TO BRING.

00:32:47.031 --> 00:32:48.633
I CAN IMAGINE THAT WE WILL BOTH

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.768
BE BRINGING THE SAME ACTION WITH

00:32:50.835 --> 00:32:52.937
DIFFERENT RESULTS OKAY BUT THE

00:32:53.004 --> 00:32:54.205
POINT IS TO FILL THEM TO MENTION

00:32:54.272 --> 00:32:54.739
YOU MENTION REPORTING TO

00:32:54.806 --> 00:32:56.374
CONGRESS WHICH OFF TO REPORT TO

00:32:56.441 --> 00:32:56.908
THE COURTS.

00:32:56.974 --> 00:32:58.276
AND TALK ABOUT SUSPICIOUS

00:32:58.343 --> 00:32:59.177
AGREEMENTS JUST BECAUSE A

00:32:59.243 --> 00:33:00.211
SUSPICIOUS DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE

00:33:00.278 --> 00:33:01.646
DOING SOMETHING UNETHICAL OR

00:33:01.713 --> 00:33:03.681
ILLEGAL RIGHT SO I'D LIKE TO

00:33:03.748 --> 00:33:04.949
HAVE FARM HAVE A CHANCE TO

00:33:05.016 --> 00:33:05.950
RESPOND TO THAT.

00:33:06.017 --> 00:33:08.019
TOO THANK YOU SENATOR -- SO IT

00:33:08.086 --> 00:33:10.455
THE F. T. C. CAN TAKE ACTION IF

00:33:10.521 --> 00:33:12.357
THEY BELIEVE THAT AN AGREEMENT

00:33:12.423 --> 00:33:13.958
IS ANTI COMPETITIVE AND THEY

00:33:14.025 --> 00:33:16.094
HAVE HISTORICALLY TAKEN ACTION

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.328
WHEN THEY BELIEVE CELL.

00:33:17.395 --> 00:33:19.097
AND THE FRAMEWORK FOR WHICH THEY

00:33:19.163 --> 00:33:21.265
CAN TAKE THAT ACTION WAS CREATED

00:33:21.332 --> 00:33:25.336
UNDER FTC VERSES ACTIVIST IN.

00:33:25.403 --> 00:33:27.338
TWENTY THIRTEEN IS AB EIGHT TO

00:33:27.405 --> 00:33:28.940
FOUR IS PASSED IN CALIFORNIA IT

00:33:29.006 --> 00:33:31.376
WILL HAVE A DIFFERENT FRAMEWORK

00:33:31.442 --> 00:33:33.277
FOR REVIEWING THESE CASES THAN

00:33:33.344 --> 00:33:34.946
THE F. T. C. WILL HAVE. TO

00:33:35.012 --> 00:33:36.247
DETERMINE IF THERE IS ANTI

00:33:36.314 --> 00:33:38.182
COMPETITIVENESS AND THIS IS WHY

00:33:38.249 --> 00:33:40.685
PHARMA IS ASKING FOR AMENDMENTS

00:33:40.752 --> 00:33:41.953
TO THE BILL TO MAKE IT THE

00:33:42.019 --> 00:33:43.454
FRAMEWORK THAT CALIFORNIA WOULD

00:33:43.521 --> 00:33:45.823
USE. TO BE MORE FAIR AND

00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:47.859
BALANCED SO THAT WAY IF THEY

00:33:47.925 --> 00:33:50.461
JUDGE BELIEVE SOMETHING IS --

00:33:50.528 --> 00:33:53.064
NOT ANTI COMPETITIVE BUT BECAUSE

00:33:53.131 --> 00:33:54.832
OF THIS LESS RESTRICTIVE MEANS

00:33:54.899 --> 00:33:55.900
STATUS BELIEVE LIKE WELL THEY

00:33:55.967 --> 00:33:57.068
COULD HAVE COME TO MARKET A DAY

00:33:57.135 --> 00:33:59.337
EARLIER SO I HAVE TO CONCLUDE

00:33:59.404 --> 00:34:00.738
ITS ANTI COMPETITIVE THIS WOULD

00:34:00.805 --> 00:34:03.107
ALLOW THE JUDGE TO CONCLUDE

00:34:03.174 --> 00:34:04.542
NATURALLY THAT IT WAS BROKEN.

00:34:04.609 --> 00:34:05.877
OKAY JUST A COUPLE MORE

00:34:05.943 --> 00:34:07.779
QUESTIONS AND DIRECTED TO ISSUE --

00:34:07.845 --> 00:34:09.080
PHARMACY TO MIND.

00:34:09.147 --> 00:34:10.081
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE IMS

00:34:10.148 --> 00:34:11.349
INSTITUTE FOR HEALTHCARE

00:34:11.416 --> 00:34:13.551
INFORMATICS -- STUDY THAT SHOWED

00:34:13.618 --> 00:34:14.152
THAT.

00:34:14.218 --> 00:34:23.461
GENERIC DRUGS BEING INTRODUCE --

00:34:23.528 --> 00:34:25.563
WERE SAVING BASICALLY SIX POINT

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:26.197
SEVEN FIVE YEARS ON THE AVERAGE

00:34:26.264 --> 00:34:28.533
PRIOR TO A PATENT EXPIRATION.

00:34:28.599 --> 00:34:30.234
AND AS I ALSO HAVE EVIDENCE THAT

00:34:30.301 --> 00:34:31.369
TEVA.

00:34:31.436 --> 00:34:32.270
PHARMACEUTICALS.

00:34:32.336 --> 00:34:32.904
ROGER -- COMPANY OUT OF ISRAEL

00:34:32.970 --> 00:34:34.472
RIGHT IN TWO THOUSAND NINE THAT

00:34:34.539 --> 00:34:35.072
SUPPLEMENTS REMOVED A HUNDRED

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:35.706
AND THIRTY EIGHT YEARS OF OF

00:34:35.773 --> 00:34:37.708
MONOPOLY PROTECTION AND PROVIDED

00:34:37.775 --> 00:34:39.277
A HUNDRED TWENTY BILLION.

00:34:39.343 --> 00:34:41.279
IN SAVINGS TO CONSUMERS THROUGH

00:34:41.345 --> 00:34:43.247
EARLY GENERIC ENTRY.

00:34:43.314 --> 00:34:44.882
SO NO WONDER DO COULD DO YOU

00:34:44.949 --> 00:34:48.085
AGREE WITH THOSE -- REPORTS AND

00:34:48.152 --> 00:34:49.120
TWO IF THIS BILL WERE TO BECOME

00:34:49.187 --> 00:34:51.055
LAW DO YOU SEE THAT THE STATE OF

00:34:51.122 --> 00:34:54.625
CALIFORNIA AND CERTAINLY AS

00:34:54.692 --> 00:34:56.060
CONSUMERS COULD.

00:34:56.127 --> 00:34:59.630
BE PAYING MORE. FOR DRUGS AND

00:34:59.697 --> 00:35:01.065
WHAT I THINK THE GOOD AUTHORS

00:35:01.132 --> 00:35:01.699
TRYING TO CHEW THROUGH HIS BILL

00:35:01.766 --> 00:35:02.500
YEAH THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION

00:35:02.567 --> 00:35:03.935
SENATOR -- YES I AM FAMILIAR

00:35:04.001 --> 00:35:05.503
WITH THE IMS REPORT AND THERE'S

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:08.339
ACTUALLY ANOTHER STUDY IN TWENTY

00:35:08.406 --> 00:35:09.006
SIXTEEN OUT OF DUKE THAT LOOKED

00:35:09.073 --> 00:35:11.409
THAT THESE CHALLENGES FROM

00:35:11.476 --> 00:35:13.077
GENERIC MANUFACTURERS AND THEY

00:35:13.144 --> 00:35:13.945
FOUND THAT.

00:35:14.011 --> 00:35:15.413
THERE IS BEEN AN INCREASE IN

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:18.316
THESE CHALLENGES AND DURING THAT

00:35:18.382 --> 00:35:20.251
SAME PERIOD THE AMOUNT OF TIME

00:35:20.318 --> 00:35:21.886
THAT A BRAND IS ACTUALLY ON THE

00:35:21.953 --> 00:35:24.589
MARKET HAS DECREASED EARLIER YOU

00:35:24.655 --> 00:35:25.957
MENTIONED THAT BRAND.

00:35:26.023 --> 00:35:28.559
MANUFACTURERS GET A PATENT FOR

00:35:28.626 --> 00:35:29.494
TWENTY YEARS FROM THE TIME THAT

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:30.895
THEY PUT IN AN APPLICATION

00:35:30.962 --> 00:35:32.263
THAT'S NOT BEFORE IT COMES TO

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:34.098
MARKET BUT TWENTY YEARS TOTAL

00:35:34.165 --> 00:35:34.899
DURING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

00:35:34.966 --> 00:35:35.433
TIME.

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:37.368
THEY FOUND THAT BECAUSE OF THESE

00:35:37.435 --> 00:35:39.270
CHALLENGES THE AVERAGE TIME TO

00:35:39.337 --> 00:35:40.972
THE BRAND ACTUALLY HAS ON THE

00:35:41.038 --> 00:35:43.508
MARKET HAS DECREASED WHILE THERE

00:35:43.574 --> 00:35:45.576
HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN THESE

00:35:45.643 --> 00:35:46.110
CHALLENGES.

00:35:46.177 --> 00:35:48.980
AND SO CHANGING THE FRAMEWORK

00:35:49.046 --> 00:35:50.214
THAT IS GOING TO OCCUR --

00:35:50.281 --> 00:35:51.916
DISCOURAGE THE SETTLEMENTS IS

00:35:51.983 --> 00:35:53.851
GOING TO LEAD TO LAST GENERICS

00:35:53.918 --> 00:35:55.353
GETTING ON TO THE MARKET SOONER

00:35:55.419 --> 00:35:57.688
OKAY AND THEN -- LASTLY -- IF

00:35:57.755 --> 00:35:59.090
YOU COULD COMMENT ON THAT THE

00:35:59.156 --> 00:36:00.892
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THAT

00:36:00.958 --> 00:36:03.227
THAT THAT'S A CONCERN FOR FOR ME

00:36:03.294 --> 00:36:03.828
AS WELL I HOPE THE AUTHOR IS

00:36:03.895 --> 00:36:06.063
GOING TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT --

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:08.499
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT -- THIS

00:36:08.566 --> 00:36:10.001
WOULD ALLOW ANYONE RIGHT TO

00:36:10.067 --> 00:36:12.470
BASICALLY FILE -- LITIGATION.

00:36:12.537 --> 00:36:14.939
AND IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

00:36:15.006 --> 00:36:16.474
LEASE IN GETTING GENERICS ON THE

00:36:16.541 --> 00:36:18.242
MARKET I THINK -- THAT THIS

00:36:18.309 --> 00:36:20.811
WOULD HAPPEN THE REVERSE EFFECT

00:36:20.878 --> 00:36:23.548
OF THROUGH THE TREMENDOUS TOWARD --

00:36:23.614 --> 00:36:25.483
INVESTMENT IN GOING THROUGH THE

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:27.718
COURTS WITH MULTIPLE.

00:36:27.785 --> 00:36:30.354
PLAINTIFFS THAT WILL EVER SEE IT

00:36:30.421 --> 00:36:31.856
TODAY OR GET ON THE MARKET.

00:36:31.923 --> 00:36:32.857
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT

00:36:32.924 --> 00:36:33.991
CORRECT BECAUSE THIS BILL WE DO

00:36:34.058 --> 00:36:34.992
BELIEVE THAT THERE IS AN

00:36:35.059 --> 00:36:36.827
EXPANDED PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION

00:36:36.894 --> 00:36:38.796
IN THIS BILL AND WE BELIEVE

00:36:38.863 --> 00:36:41.098
BECAUSE THERE IS THE PRESUMPTION

00:36:41.165 --> 00:36:42.733
THAT THESE -- AGREEMENTS ARE

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.535
ANTI COMPETITIVE BEFORE ANY

00:36:44.602 --> 00:36:46.938
OTHER FACTS ARE PRESENTED THAT

00:36:47.004 --> 00:36:48.406
WE COULD SEE AN INCREASE IN

00:36:48.472 --> 00:36:49.607
LITIGATION AND IF YOU WOULDN'T

00:36:49.674 --> 00:36:57.214
MIND I'D LOVE TO HAVE THE PERSON

00:36:57.281 --> 00:36:59.283
FROM SEJAK EXPERTISE.

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:00.351
SO I'M AN EXPERT AT KNOWING WHAT

00:37:00.418 --> 00:37:01.352
I'M NOT AN EXPERT AT AS I

00:37:01.419 --> 00:37:01.986
UNDERSTAND THIS VERY COMPLICATED

00:37:02.053 --> 00:37:03.287
BODY OF LAW AGAIN LAID OUT

00:37:03.354 --> 00:37:04.822
NICELY IN THE ANALYSIS YOU OF

00:37:04.889 --> 00:37:05.389
THIS.

00:37:05.456 --> 00:37:06.490
CAUSE OF ACTION WITH THE BURDEN

00:37:06.557 --> 00:37:07.525
SHIFTING TO THE DRUG

00:37:07.592 --> 00:37:09.293
MANUFACTURER.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:10.795
UNDER CIPRO THERE WERE FOUR

00:37:10.861 --> 00:37:12.063
ISSUES THAT THE PLAINTIFF HAD TO

00:37:12.129 --> 00:37:14.865
ESTABLISH WHICH HAS BEEN REDUCED.

00:37:14.932 --> 00:37:16.601
TO TWO SO IT'S MAKING IT EASIER

00:37:16.667 --> 00:37:18.135
FOR THE PERSON TO BRING THE

00:37:18.202 --> 00:37:19.270
ACTION.

00:37:19.337 --> 00:37:20.805
AND THEN THE BURDEN SHIFTS TO

00:37:20.871 --> 00:37:23.341
THE DRUG MANUFACTURER TO SHOW

00:37:23.407 --> 00:37:25.409
THAT IT'S NOT ANTI COMPETITIVE

00:37:25.476 --> 00:37:27.244
AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS GOING

00:37:27.311 --> 00:37:29.513
DOWN TO TWO IS WHY WE ASK FOR AN

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:30.915
AMENDMENT THAT TO THE EXTENT YOU

00:37:30.982 --> 00:37:32.416
HAVE A PRIVATE.

00:37:32.483 --> 00:37:34.518
THIRD PARTY PLAINTIFF THAT THAT

00:37:34.585 --> 00:37:36.153
THE STANDARDS BE THE SAME AS

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:37.622
ARTICULATED IN THE SERB PRO

00:37:37.688 --> 00:37:40.591
DECISION.

00:37:40.658 --> 00:37:41.859
THANK YOU AND I GUESS SO LASTLY

00:37:41.926 --> 00:37:42.660
FOR THE AUTHOR WAS AS AN

00:37:42.727 --> 00:37:43.628
AMENDMENT THAT YOU'RE

00:37:43.694 --> 00:37:45.029
CONSIDERING OR ARE NOT

00:37:45.096 --> 00:37:46.564
CONSIDERED I'M NOT CONSIDERING

00:37:46.631 --> 00:37:47.965
THAT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS

00:37:48.032 --> 00:37:48.899
CREATES A NEW PRIVATE RIGHT OF

00:37:48.966 --> 00:37:51.168
ACTION -- UNDER THE MY MY

00:37:51.235 --> 00:37:53.304
UNDERSTANDING IS -- THAT IT DOES

00:37:53.371 --> 00:37:55.006
NOT AFFECT EXISTING PRIDE IRAQ

00:37:55.072 --> 00:37:56.841
RIGHT THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF

00:37:56.907 --> 00:37:57.875
ACTION UNDER THE CART RIGHT ACT.

00:37:57.942 --> 00:37:59.410
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT I DON'T

00:37:59.477 --> 00:38:00.244
BELIEVE THIS IS AN EXPANSION OF

00:38:00.311 --> 00:38:03.648
THAT -- WE CAN AGREE TO DISAGREE

00:38:03.714 --> 00:38:05.516
ON THAT BUT IT'S ALREADY THERE

00:38:05.583 --> 00:38:07.018
IN THE CART RIGHT ACT.

00:38:07.084 --> 00:38:08.386
AND I'D ALSO I ALSO THE

00:38:08.452 --> 00:38:10.054
CONTENTION THAT ARE THE CONCERN

00:38:10.121 --> 00:38:11.322
THAT THIS IS GOING TO LEAD TO A

00:38:11.389 --> 00:38:13.491
PROLIFERATION OF OF OF LEGAL

00:38:13.557 --> 00:38:15.559
ACTIONS I THINK IS I THINK IS IS

00:38:15.626 --> 00:38:16.594
IS WRONG.

00:38:16.661 --> 00:38:18.496
THESE ARE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE

00:38:18.562 --> 00:38:20.531
CASES TO BRING TO TRIAL IN MANY

00:38:20.598 --> 00:38:23.467
CASES IT COULD BE FOUR TO FIVE

00:38:23.534 --> 00:38:24.001
TO SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR

00:38:24.068 --> 00:38:24.568
WITNESSES.

00:38:24.635 --> 00:38:26.804
LOAN THE EXPERT WITNESSES ALONE

00:38:26.871 --> 00:38:28.706
TO PUT THESE TOGETHER SO THIS IS

00:38:28.773 --> 00:38:31.208
NOT GOING TO LEAD TO A YOU KNOW

00:38:31.275 --> 00:38:31.976
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE YOU

00:38:32.043 --> 00:38:32.443
KNOW.

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:34.278
THE CORNER THE GUY ON THE CORNER

00:38:34.345 --> 00:38:35.246
IS AN ATTORNEY BRINGING THESE

00:38:35.312 --> 00:38:37.348
BRING THE SUITS OF THE THE

00:38:37.415 --> 00:38:38.315
MAJORITY SINCE RUSSIA BEING

00:38:38.382 --> 00:38:39.283
COULD BE BROUGHT.

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:40.518
THROUGH THROUGH THROUGH THE

00:38:40.584 --> 00:38:42.687
STATE OR A AN EMPLOYEE OF A

00:38:42.753 --> 00:38:44.522
LARGE EMPLOYER MAYBE A UNION

00:38:44.588 --> 00:38:46.624
TRUST SOMEBODY WHO HAS A VESTED

00:38:46.691 --> 00:38:48.192
INTEREST IN.

00:38:48.259 --> 00:38:49.060
AND CAN ACTUALLY FRONT THE THE

00:38:49.126 --> 00:38:50.761
HUGE COST IS GOING TO TAKE TO

00:38:50.828 --> 00:38:51.896
LITIGATE A CASE LIKE THIS SO I

00:38:51.962 --> 00:38:52.797
DON'T BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO LEAD

00:38:52.863 --> 00:38:53.998
TO THAT KIND OF PROLIFERATION

00:38:54.065 --> 00:38:54.865
YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT.

00:38:54.932 --> 00:38:56.467
I APPRECIATE YOUR EXPLANATION

00:38:56.534 --> 00:38:58.035
BUT I KNOW ONE THING.

00:38:58.102 --> 00:38:59.603
I KNOW THE DRUG COMPANIES ARE

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:00.938
DEEP POCKETS AND I KNOW THERE'S

00:39:01.005 --> 00:39:01.872
A LOT OF ATTORNEYS OUT THERE

00:39:01.939 --> 00:39:03.340
THAT MIGHT BE WILLING TO MAKE AN

00:39:03.407 --> 00:39:04.709
INVESTMENT TO TRY TO GO AFTER

00:39:04.775 --> 00:39:05.910
THOSE DEEP POCKETS.

00:39:05.976 --> 00:39:06.844
AND I'M CONCERNED WE MIGHT SEE

00:39:06.911 --> 00:39:09.947
SOME FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS SAID --

00:39:10.014 --> 00:39:11.649
GET IN THE WAY OF AND I GUESS I

00:39:11.716 --> 00:39:12.516
WOULD JUST SAY -- YOU KNOW.

00:39:12.583 --> 00:39:14.418
STOP THE ACTIVITY AND THERE

00:39:14.485 --> 00:39:15.986
WOULDN'T BE A NEED FOR THIS SO

00:39:16.053 --> 00:39:17.688
THAT IS THE THAT IS A POINT.

00:39:17.755 --> 00:39:19.824
THERE WAS A FEDERAL TRADE --

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:20.725
FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION --

00:39:20.791 --> 00:39:22.326
PRESENTATION TO CONGRESS ABOUT

00:39:22.393 --> 00:39:27.765
TEN YEARS AGO THAT SAID.

00:39:27.832 --> 00:39:28.833
THE PROCESS ISN'T WORKING VERY

00:39:28.899 --> 00:39:29.767
WELL THEY ACTUALLY CALLED THE

00:39:29.834 --> 00:39:30.367
CALLED OUT AND SAID WE NEED

00:39:30.434 --> 00:39:32.336
LITIGATION TO HELP SOLVE THIS

00:39:32.403 --> 00:39:33.537
ISSUE.

00:39:33.604 --> 00:39:35.773
NOW CONGRESS HAS FAILED TO ACT.

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:36.607
THERE IS A BILL BEFORE CONGRESS

00:39:36.674 --> 00:39:38.976
NOW -- BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT

00:39:39.043 --> 00:39:40.177
IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT FOR

00:39:40.244 --> 00:39:42.113
ANYTHING TO HAPPEN IN CONGRESS

00:39:42.179 --> 00:39:42.413
THESE DAYS.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.048
SO.

00:39:44.115 --> 00:39:45.349
THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION

00:39:45.416 --> 00:39:48.052
CALLED ON CONGRESS TO ACT.

00:39:48.119 --> 00:39:49.820
WE ARE ACTING IN CALIFORNIA IN

00:39:49.887 --> 00:39:51.222
YES WE ARE GOING TO CREATE A

00:39:51.288 --> 00:39:52.823
DIFFERENT STANDARD A STRICTER

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:54.925
STANDARD WHICH WE ARE WE HAVE

00:39:54.992 --> 00:39:56.327
THE RIGHT TO DO IN CALIFORNIA WE

00:39:56.393 --> 00:39:58.329
HAVE THE RIGHT.

00:39:58.395 --> 00:39:59.897
TO THINGS DIFFERENTLY -- THE

00:39:59.964 --> 00:40:00.965
FLOW OF THE FEDERAL THE FEDERAL

00:40:01.031 --> 00:40:03.667
LAW IS IS NOT THE CEILING HERE.

00:40:03.734 --> 00:40:04.869
WE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO

00:40:04.935 --> 00:40:06.871
THAT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE

00:40:06.937 --> 00:40:09.940
CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA.

00:40:10.007 --> 00:40:11.041
OKAY SO I ACTUALLY -- BEFORE

00:40:11.108 --> 00:40:13.377
MILAN TAXI I DO WANT TO CLARIFY

00:40:13.444 --> 00:40:15.246
AND IT -- THIS ISSUE SO I

00:40:15.312 --> 00:40:17.581
CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND -- THAT

00:40:17.648 --> 00:40:18.849
SEJAK THINK STIRS AND THE

00:40:18.916 --> 00:40:20.117
EXPANSION OF THE PRIOR ACTION

00:40:20.184 --> 00:40:22.486
BECAUSE IT'S EASIER TO BRING

00:40:22.553 --> 00:40:24.255
SUIT.

00:40:24.321 --> 00:40:24.789
I ADMIT ARE LEDGE COUNCIL

00:40:24.855 --> 00:40:26.357
DISAGREES THEY DON'T THINK THAT

00:40:26.423 --> 00:40:27.591
THERE IS A CERTAINLY I DON'T

00:40:27.658 --> 00:40:28.793
THINK ANYONE SAID THERE'S A NEW

00:40:28.859 --> 00:40:29.560
PIRATE ACTION TO QUESTIONS

00:40:29.627 --> 00:40:32.363
WHETHER THERE'S AN EXPANDED

00:40:32.429 --> 00:40:32.897
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.

00:40:32.963 --> 00:40:34.165
YES THE BILL DOES MAKE IT EASIER

00:40:34.231 --> 00:40:36.333
FOR PEOPLE TO BRING SUIT -- BUT

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.668
WE THAT THAT'S NOT VIEWED BY

00:40:37.735 --> 00:40:39.937
PLEDGE COUNCIL AS AN EXPANSION

00:40:40.004 --> 00:40:41.172
THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION I

00:40:41.238 --> 00:40:42.373
WOULD ALSO MENTION THAT YOU'VE

00:40:42.439 --> 00:40:44.408
ACCEPTED AMENDMENTS SO THERE'S A

00:40:44.475 --> 00:40:46.343
SAID AMENDMENTS ONE AMENDMENTS.

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:46.844
WHO'S SO WE PUT A LITTLE

00:40:46.911 --> 00:40:47.778
GUARDRAIL BASICALLY SAYS CLEAR

00:40:47.845 --> 00:40:49.146
FIGHTING ANY PENALTIES AWARDED

00:40:49.213 --> 00:40:50.514
UNDER THE BILL'S PROVISIONS CAN

00:40:50.581 --> 00:40:51.849
ONLY BE RECOVERED BY THE

00:40:51.916 --> 00:40:52.783
ATTORNEY GENERAL AND A CREW TO

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:54.752
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO.

00:40:54.819 --> 00:40:56.187
SOMEONE WHO GOES AND PURSUE THIS

00:40:56.253 --> 00:40:57.688
LAWSUITANY SORT OF PENALTY

00:40:57.755 --> 00:40:59.623
ACTUALLY THEY CAN'T GET IT COMES

00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:01.792
TO THE STATE SO THE COULD BE A

00:41:01.859 --> 00:41:02.927
THIRD PARTY AND AGAIN THIS IS

00:41:02.993 --> 00:41:04.495
GOING TO JUDICIARY TO DIG INTO

00:41:04.562 --> 00:41:06.430
MORE OF THESE PARTICULAR ISSUES

00:41:06.497 --> 00:41:08.432
BUT AT LEAST ONE WE SOUGHT OUT.

00:41:08.499 --> 00:41:10.000
ADVICE FROM LEDGE COUNCIL AROUND

00:41:10.067 --> 00:41:11.302
THE PRIMARY ACTIONS AN ISSUE

00:41:11.368 --> 00:41:12.303
THAT I ACTUALLY YOU KNOW I HAVE

00:41:12.369 --> 00:41:14.972
COME TO THE ALSO HAVE CONCERNS

00:41:15.039 --> 00:41:15.439
ABOUT.

00:41:15.506 --> 00:41:17.074
THE THAT WAS THE EXPLANATION

00:41:17.141 --> 00:41:18.275
RECEIVE THE ELSE I THINK THERE

00:41:18.342 --> 00:41:19.109
MAY BE SOME DIFFERENCE OF

00:41:19.176 --> 00:41:20.578
OPINION IS IT AND I DO

00:41:20.644 --> 00:41:22.980
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SEJAK POSITION

00:41:23.047 --> 00:41:23.480
ABOUT.

00:41:23.547 --> 00:41:25.449
SAYING THAT WHILE IT IS EASIER I

00:41:25.516 --> 00:41:26.717
MEAN THAT'S A SOMETIMES THAT'S

00:41:26.784 --> 00:41:28.886
PURPOSE THE BILL TO MAKE HE'S

00:41:28.953 --> 00:41:32.189
HERE -- BECAUSE NOTHING BECAUSE

00:41:32.256 --> 00:41:34.358
THAT THE GOING TO PROPONENTS NOT

00:41:34.425 --> 00:41:35.426
ENOUGH IS HAPPENING IS I THINK A

00:41:35.492 --> 00:41:41.332
DAUGHTER JUST MENTIONED AS WELL

00:41:41.398 --> 00:41:42.833
BUT THAT IN ITSELF.

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:43.634
THERE'S NOTHING AT ANY THAT IN

00:41:43.701 --> 00:41:44.902
ITSELF IF YOU THINK IS AN

00:41:44.969 --> 00:41:45.569
EXPANSION.

00:41:45.636 --> 00:41:46.403
THAT THESE DIFFERENT THAN

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:47.271
ACTUALLY THERE'S NO OTHER

00:41:47.338 --> 00:41:47.872
PROVISION A BILL THERE'S NO

00:41:47.938 --> 00:41:48.672
PROVISION A BILL THAT ACTUALLY

00:41:48.739 --> 00:41:50.574
IS EXPANDING THE PRIVATE RIGHT

00:41:50.641 --> 00:41:52.176
OF ACTION AND AGAIN WE BANDED

00:41:52.243 --> 00:41:53.277
AUTHORS IT DOES AGREE TO AN

00:41:53.344 --> 00:41:54.411
AMENDMENT THAT SAYS.

00:41:54.478 --> 00:41:55.713
THAT TO CLARIFY THAT THE ANY

00:41:55.779 --> 00:41:56.847
PENALTIES ACCRUE BACK TO THE

00:41:56.914 --> 00:41:57.514
STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE ATTORNEY

00:41:57.581 --> 00:41:58.415
GENERAL SO I JUST WANT TO BE

00:41:58.482 --> 00:41:59.650
CLEAR ABOUT LEASE WITH THE

00:41:59.717 --> 00:42:00.951
THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE IN THIS

00:42:01.018 --> 00:42:02.820

I DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS --

00:42:14.465 --> 00:42:15.165
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING LIKE IN

00:42:15.232 --> 00:42:17.935
NET -- OTHER COUNTRIES TO AVOID

00:42:18.002 --> 00:42:19.937
EXPENSE SALUTE EXPENSIVE AND

00:42:20.004 --> 00:42:22.339
TIMELY SETTLEMENTS I GUESS YOU'D

00:42:22.406 --> 00:42:23.841
SAY -- LITIGATION DELAYS SO THAT

00:42:23.908 --> 00:42:25.609
WE CAN DELIVER THE PRODUCTS TO

00:42:25.676 --> 00:42:26.510
MARKET.

00:42:26.577 --> 00:42:28.579
A BRANDY GENERIC MANUFACTURERS

00:42:28.646 --> 00:42:30.147
OFTEN ENTER INTO SETTLEMENT

00:42:30.214 --> 00:42:31.181
AGREEMENTS INCLUDE GLOBAL

00:42:31.248 --> 00:42:32.516
AGREEMENTS AND THERE'S AN

00:42:32.583 --> 00:42:34.218
EXEMPTION YOU DON'T HAVE AN

00:42:34.285 --> 00:42:35.486
EXEMPTION FOR WHAT WOULD BE

00:42:35.552 --> 00:42:36.520
GLOBAL SETTLEMENTS.

00:42:36.587 --> 00:42:38.055
NOT AGREEMENT SORRY SO IS A

00:42:38.122 --> 00:42:39.590
REASON WHY YOU DIDN'T TAKE ON

00:42:39.657 --> 00:42:41.025
THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT ISSUE WE

00:42:41.091 --> 00:42:42.126
ACTUALLY WE ANSWER THAT QUESTION

00:42:42.192 --> 00:42:44.128

SO THE REASON WE DON'T HAVE AN

00:42:52.169 --> 00:42:53.837
EXEMPTION FOR GLOBAL SETTLEMENTS

00:42:53.904 --> 00:42:55.539
IS BECAUSE THE LITIGATION THAT'S

00:42:55.606 --> 00:42:57.207
BEEN SETTLED.

00:42:57.274 --> 00:42:59.076
UNDER THE HATCH WAXMAN ACT OF

00:43:00.945 --> 00:43:02.746
PATENTS.

00:43:02.813 --> 00:43:05.182
AND US PATENTS ONLY GOVERN

00:43:05.249 --> 00:43:08.719
COMPETITION IN IN THE US MARKET.

00:43:08.786 --> 00:43:11.055
SO IF WE ALLOW.

00:43:11.121 --> 00:43:12.356
THE PARTIES TO CARVE UP WORLD

00:43:12.423 --> 00:43:14.491
MARKETS WHAT HAPPENS IS THE

00:43:14.558 --> 00:43:15.025
BRAND.

00:43:15.092 --> 00:43:17.561
CAN HEY THE GENERIC TO STAY OFF

00:43:17.628 --> 00:43:19.964
THE US MARKET AND LET THEM

00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:21.398
COMPETE IN THE REST OF THE WORLD

00:43:21.465 --> 00:43:22.466
AND WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN

00:43:22.533 --> 00:43:23.901
INSTANCES OF THAT.

00:43:23.968 --> 00:43:27.571
ON IN IN THE INSULIN DRUGS WHERE --

00:43:27.638 --> 00:43:28.939
ONE INSULIN MANUFACTURER HAS

00:43:29.006 --> 00:43:31.108
AGREED TO STAY OFF THE US MARKET

00:43:31.175 --> 00:43:32.910
BUT IS COMPETING IN ALL THE

00:43:32.977 --> 00:43:34.778
WORLD MARKET SO WE DON'T WANT IT

00:43:34.845 --> 00:43:35.479
TO BE.

00:43:35.546 --> 00:43:40.584
A VEHICLE FOR THE TRANSFER OF

00:43:40.651 --> 00:43:41.719
CONSIDERATION -- PAYMENT

00:43:47.257 --> 00:43:48.625
ISSUE BEFORE.

IT DIES YEAH SURE -- THANK YOU.

00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:54.798
ALL HAVE TO EXPLORE SO LITTLE

00:43:54.865 --> 00:43:56.333
IGNORANCE ON THE INTERNATIONAL

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.769
MARKETS BUT I CAN SAY IS THAT

00:43:58.836 --> 00:44:00.504
THESE DO NOT.

00:44:00.571 --> 00:44:01.772
HAPPEN IN SECRET THE SUB TYPES

00:44:01.839 --> 00:44:03.340
OF SUPPLEMENTS THAT THEY DON'T

00:44:03.407 --> 00:44:05.175
OCCUR THAT WAY THEY ARE REPORTED

00:44:05.242 --> 00:44:07.044
TO THE FTC THE FTC DOES REVIEW

00:44:07.111 --> 00:44:10.381

IN SOME AS FAR AS GLOBAL AND AND

00:44:22.026 --> 00:44:23.994

00:44:24.061 --> 00:44:25.629
WORLD MARKET -- YOU KNOW AS I

00:44:25.696 --> 00:44:27.031

INSULIN WAS MENTIONED THERE ARE

INSOLENCE IN THE UNITED STATES

00:44:31.368 --> 00:44:32.236
YET.

00:44:32.302 --> 00:44:35.606
WE'RE WORKING VERY VERY HARD.

00:44:35.672 --> 00:44:37.708
TO BRING THOSE FORWARD -- BUT

00:44:37.775 --> 00:44:39.543
IT'S IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT DRUG

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:42.679
AND IN FACT THE FDA'S CHANGE THE

00:44:42.746 --> 00:44:44.314
PATHWAY TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT --

00:44:44.381 --> 00:44:45.249
AND SO THAT'S WHAT REALLY THE

00:44:45.315 --> 00:44:47.351
DELAY IN INSULIN PRICES HAVE

00:44:47.418 --> 00:44:49.920
BEEN OR INSULIN -- GENERIC DRUGS

00:44:49.987 --> 00:44:50.788
OR BY -- SELLERS COMING TO

00:44:50.854 --> 00:44:51.455
MARKET.

00:44:51.522 --> 00:44:57.728
pSOME SORT OF GLOBAL AGREEMENT.

00:44:57.795 --> 00:44:58.929
THANK YOU.

00:44:58.996 --> 00:45:00.364
AM I GUESS I HAVE A CONCERN THAT --

00:45:00.431 --> 00:45:01.465
IF YOU'RE LEGISLATION IS WRONG I

00:45:01.532 --> 00:45:01.999
MEAN IF IT'S WRONG AND IT

00:45:02.066 --> 00:45:04.635
DOESN'T PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH --

00:45:04.701 --> 00:45:05.469
GENERIC DRUGS AVAILABLE ON THE

00:45:05.536 --> 00:45:06.904
MARKET AM I THINK YOU NEED A

00:45:06.970 --> 00:45:07.905
BACKUP PLAN BECAUSE YOU KNOW

00:45:07.971 --> 00:45:09.339
LOOKING AT THE INFORMATION THAT

00:45:09.406 --> 00:45:10.607
I HAVE IT IT'S GONNA ACTUALLY

00:45:10.674 --> 00:45:12.609
ADVERSELY AFFECT BRINGING

00:45:12.676 --> 00:45:14.011
PRODUCTS TO MARKET.

00:45:14.078 --> 00:45:16.880
FROM A GENERIC STANDPOINT AND

00:45:16.947 --> 00:45:17.481
SORRY I WISH THERE WERE SOME

00:45:17.548 --> 00:45:19.616
TYPE OF BACKUP PLAN BUT I DO --

00:45:19.683 --> 00:45:21.351
I DO AGREE WITH SENATOR STONE

00:45:21.418 --> 00:45:21.885
AND I THINK THE CHAIR FOR

00:45:21.952 --> 00:45:22.553
CLARIFYING THE AMENDMENTS ON THE

00:45:22.619 --> 00:45:24.421
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BECAUSE

00:45:24.488 --> 00:45:25.589
IT'S ABOUT THE SETTLEMENT IT'S

00:45:25.656 --> 00:45:27.157
NOT ACTUALLY IT'S ABOUT THE THE

00:45:27.224 --> 00:45:28.425
COST OF LITIGATION AND COMING TO

00:45:28.492 --> 00:45:29.960
A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT.

00:45:30.027 --> 00:45:31.095
AND SO I AM GLAD THAT IT'S NOT

00:45:31.161 --> 00:45:32.262
GOING TO A THIRD PARTY OR

00:45:32.329 --> 00:45:33.697
SOMEONE WHO BRINGS THE THE

00:45:33.764 --> 00:45:35.432
LAWSUIT BUT IT COMES BACK TO THE

00:45:35.499 --> 00:45:38.035
STATES SO THERE'S NO.

00:45:38.102 --> 00:45:40.370
YOU KNOW -- ACTION I GUESS THAT

00:45:40.437 --> 00:45:41.338
THE ATTORNEYS WOULD HAVE.

00:45:41.405 --> 00:45:42.406
TO YOU KNOW WHEN YOULOOK AT A

00:45:42.473 --> 00:45:43.474
FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR SETTLEMENT

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:44.975
YET 33% PLUS THIRD PARTY

00:45:45.042 --> 00:45:46.043
ADMINISTRATION FEES THAT ARE IN

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:48.112
YOUR OWN HOUSE PER SE.

00:45:48.178 --> 00:45:52.483
THEN THAT'S A HUGE ISSUE BUT AT

00:45:52.549 --> 00:45:53.617
IS THERE ANY CHANCE OF THAT CAN

00:45:53.684 --> 00:45:55.652
GO TO FEDERAL COURT HAS WELL

00:45:55.719 --> 00:45:57.821
WHICH ONCE AGAIN WE WE WOULD

00:45:57.888 --> 00:45:58.922
LOVE TO HAVE THE FEDERAL

00:45:58.989 --> 00:45:59.990
GOVERNMENT ENGAGE IN ACTUALLY

00:46:00.057 --> 00:46:01.458
COME UP WITH THE LAW WE'VE BEEN

00:46:01.525 --> 00:46:02.559
WAITING FOR THAT TO HAPPEN FOR

00:46:02.626 --> 00:46:03.694
MANY YEARS AS I SAID.

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:05.062
EARLIER THE FTC IS CALLED UPON

00:46:05.129 --> 00:46:07.531
CONGRESS TO TO CHANGE THE LAW

00:46:07.598 --> 00:46:08.799
AND CONGRESS FAILED TO ACT

00:46:08.866 --> 00:46:09.600
THAT'S WHY WERE ACTING HERE IN

00:46:09.666 --> 00:46:10.634
CALIFORNIA.

00:46:10.701 --> 00:46:13.403
THE REALITY IS IF SOMEHOW WE WE

00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:16.106
WE WE OFTEN DO THINGS AND LET IT

00:46:16.173 --> 00:46:17.407
THAT LEGISLATION THAT.

00:46:17.474 --> 00:46:19.409
THAT REQUIRE US TO GO BACK AND

00:46:19.476 --> 00:46:20.711
MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO WE HAVE THE

00:46:20.777 --> 00:46:22.946
ABILITY TO DO THAT -- AND I

00:46:23.013 --> 00:46:24.414
WOULD I WOULD SAY THAT IN THIS

00:46:24.481 --> 00:46:26.216
CASE IF WE FIND THAT THE THINGS

00:46:26.283 --> 00:46:27.217
ARE WORKING EXACTLY THE WAY WITH

00:46:27.284 --> 00:46:29.086
YOU WE WILL GO BACK AND DO THAT

00:46:29.153 --> 00:46:30.387
AND I HAVE DONE THAT WITH OTHER

00:46:30.454 --> 00:46:31.488
PIECES OF LEGISLATION SO.

00:46:31.555 --> 00:46:32.422
I'M NOT GONNA SAY THAT

00:46:32.489 --> 00:46:33.590
EVERYTHING IS PERFECT FROM

00:46:33.657 --> 00:46:35.259
BEGINNING I WOULD IMAGINE

00:46:35.325 --> 00:46:36.393
THERE'S PEOPLE ON THE DíAS WHO

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:36.927
HAVE BILLS I THOUGHT WERE

00:46:36.994 --> 00:46:37.928
PERFECT WE FOUND OUT THAT

00:46:37.995 --> 00:46:42.132
SOMETHING WASN'T QUITE RIGHT.

00:46:42.199 --> 00:46:48.872
MAYBE NOT YOU CENTER.

00:46:48.939 --> 00:46:50.040
BUT BUT BUT YOU KNOW THE THE

00:46:50.107 --> 00:46:50.741
READOUT THE REALITY IS THAT THIS

00:46:50.807 --> 00:46:54.077
IS -- THIS THIS IS AN ISSUE AND

00:46:54.144 --> 00:46:55.679
AND WE ARE WE ARE TAKING.

00:46:55.746 --> 00:46:56.647
AND I AND I WOULD SAY I WOULD

00:46:56.713 --> 00:46:58.048
SAY JUST IN GENERAL WHAT IS WHAT

00:46:58.115 --> 00:46:59.516
IS FASCINATING ABOUT THIS TO ME

00:46:59.583 --> 00:47:00.284
IS THAT.

00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:02.452
THE PREMISE ON WHICH ROBIN IS

00:47:02.519 --> 00:47:04.721
REALLY VERY SIMPLE -- I THINK

00:47:04.788 --> 00:47:05.355
THE OPPOSITION IS THAT A VERY

00:47:05.422 --> 00:47:06.523
GOOD JOB OF TRYING TO MAKE IT

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:07.991
MAKE IT REALLY CONFUSING AND

00:47:08.058 --> 00:47:09.526
THAT'S AND THAT'S DISAPPOINTING.

00:47:09.593 --> 00:47:10.827
I DON'T I I I HAVE TO DISAGREE

00:47:10.894 --> 00:47:12.196
ON GETS CONFUSING I JUST THINK

00:47:12.262 --> 00:47:13.530
THAT YOU MAYBE HAVE ONE BAD

00:47:13.597 --> 00:47:14.731
APPLE AND THEN YOU'RE TRYING TO

00:47:14.798 --> 00:47:16.366
RAINY IN AN ENTIRE INDUSTRY.

00:47:16.433 --> 00:47:18.402
THAT -- HAS BEEN COMPLIANT WITH

00:47:18.468 --> 00:47:20.871
THE LAW AND NOT PAY THIS PAID A

00:47:20.938 --> 00:47:21.605
DELAY OR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO

00:47:21.672 --> 00:47:23.507
CALL IT I MEAN THE MAJORITY OF

00:47:23.574 --> 00:47:24.675
THE CONTRACTS OF THE SETTLEMENTS

00:47:24.741 --> 00:47:26.043
HAVE GONE FORTH AREN'T LIKE THAT

00:47:26.109 --> 00:47:28.011
BASED ON THE EVIDENCE THAT WE'VE

00:47:28.078 --> 00:47:29.346
SEEN -- THAT SO I'VE BEEN SHOWN

00:47:29.413 --> 00:47:31.582
SO I THINK THIS ONE OR TWO BAD

00:47:31.648 --> 00:47:32.649
APPLES THAT HAVE BEEN REFERENCED

00:47:32.716 --> 00:47:35.385
HERE DOESN'T REQUIRE LEGISLATION

00:47:35.452 --> 00:47:36.820
TO TO REGULATED ENTIRE INDUSTRY

00:47:36.887 --> 00:47:38.722
THAT COULD DELAY CONSUMER

00:47:38.789 --> 00:47:39.756
PRODUCTS FROM THE OR GET FROM

00:47:39.823 --> 00:47:41.925
THE FROM THE GENERIC SIDE TO

00:47:41.992 --> 00:47:42.759
COME TO THE MARKET.

00:47:42.826 --> 00:47:43.994
AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE

00:47:44.061 --> 00:47:45.629
MANUFACTURER WHETHER IT'S

00:47:45.696 --> 00:47:47.564
GENERIC OR NOT GENERIC THE

00:47:47.631 --> 00:47:48.465
INVESTOR TREMENDOUS AMOUNTOF

00:47:48.532 --> 00:47:50.200
MONEY -- AND ALL THE FAILURE IN

00:47:50.267 --> 00:47:52.035
WHAT THAT COST THEM TO DEVELOP A

00:47:52.102 --> 00:47:53.737
DRUG THAT THAT HAS THE

00:47:53.804 --> 00:47:55.405
OPPORTUNITY TO WORK AND SAVE

00:47:55.472 --> 00:47:56.907
LIVES AND YOU KNOW THAT'S A

00:47:56.974 --> 00:47:57.674
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT YOU HAVE

00:47:57.741 --> 00:47:59.343
TO BILL TO MAKE YOUR MONEY BACK

00:47:59.409 --> 00:47:59.776
SOMEHOW.

00:47:59.843 --> 00:48:00.911
AND IF THAT MEANS YOU HAVE A

00:48:00.978 --> 00:48:01.878
PATENT ON IT FOR TWENTY YEARS

00:48:01.945 --> 00:48:03.146
AND YOU GET TO CREATE THAT

00:48:03.213 --> 00:48:04.548
REVENUE JUST FOR YOURSELF.

00:48:04.615 --> 00:48:05.949
THEN THAT'S A BUSINESS

00:48:06.016 --> 00:48:09.786
OPPORTUNITY -- THAT CREATES --

00:48:09.853 --> 00:48:11.121
BUT THE PAYS THE BACK FOR THE

00:48:11.188 --> 00:48:12.356
INVESTMENT THEY MADE TO BE ABLE

00:48:12.422 --> 00:48:14.491
TO SAVE PEOPLE'S LIVES -- AND TO

00:48:14.558 --> 00:48:15.592
HAVE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN

00:48:15.659 --> 00:48:16.960
THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION STEP

00:48:17.027 --> 00:48:18.495
IN AND STOP ALL OF THAT FROM A

00:48:18.562 --> 00:48:19.730
BUSINESS STANDPOINT I THINK ITS

00:48:19.796 --> 00:48:21.632
INTERFERENCE FROM GOVERNMENT

00:48:21.698 --> 00:48:22.532
THAT SHOULDN'T BE.

00:48:22.599 --> 00:48:27.871
ALLOWED I THINK WHAT DOES AGREE

00:48:27.938 --> 00:48:28.605
TO DISAGREE I WOULD SAY THAT --

00:48:28.672 --> 00:48:29.940
THAT IF WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

00:48:30.007 --> 00:48:31.508
THE PRIMARY PATTON COMPOUND

00:48:31.575 --> 00:48:33.510
PATTON -- YEAH MAYBE THAT MAYBE

00:48:33.577 --> 00:48:34.144
SOME OF THE LINE IT WOULD WOULD

00:48:34.211 --> 00:48:34.978
LET LINE OF THINKING MIGHT BE

00:48:35.045 --> 00:48:35.979
MORE APPROPRIATE.

00:48:36.046 --> 00:48:38.015
BUT THIS COULD GIVE AN EXAMPLE --

00:48:38.081 --> 00:48:39.916
TRUE BOTTOM -- MADE BY KELLY AT

00:48:39.983 --> 00:48:43.820
WAS ON THE MARKET IN -- NINETEEN

00:48:43.887 --> 00:48:45.322
EIGHTY SEVEN I BELIEVE -- WE ARE

00:48:45.389 --> 00:48:47.557
STILL -- BECAUSE OF TWEAKS AN

00:48:47.624 --> 00:48:48.825
ADDITIONAL COMPOUNDS THAT HAVE

00:48:48.892 --> 00:48:50.460
GONE ALONG THIRTY TWO YEARS

00:48:50.527 --> 00:48:51.795
LATER THAT IS STILL UNDER PATENT

00:48:51.862 --> 00:48:53.163
PROTECTION.

00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:55.132
SO THERE IS A THERE IS THERE HAS

00:48:55.198 --> 00:48:56.166
BEEN AN AGREEMENT REACHED TO

00:48:56.233 --> 00:48:58.068
BRING A GENERIC TO MARKET A

00:48:58.135 --> 00:49:00.837
COUPLE YEARS SOONER.

00:49:00.904 --> 00:49:04.141
BUT WE'RE WELL BEYOND THE

00:49:04.207 --> 00:49:04.675
SEVENTEEN YEARS OF PATENT

00:49:04.741 --> 00:49:06.043
PROTECTION HERE.

00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:08.278
AND SO I HAVE ASKED I HAVE ASKED

00:49:08.345 --> 00:49:10.714
THE OPPOSITION IF YOU HAVE

00:49:10.781 --> 00:49:12.582
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS THAT BRING

00:49:12.649 --> 00:49:14.251
SOMETHING TO MARKET CLOSE --

00:49:14.318 --> 00:49:16.119
SOONER.

00:49:16.186 --> 00:49:17.487
IT WHICH WHICH IS.

00:49:17.554 --> 00:49:19.523
WHICH IS PART OF THIS BILL.

00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:20.791
THEN SHOW ME PLEASE SHOW ME THAT

00:49:20.857 --> 00:49:22.359
IS PRO COMPETITIVE SHOW ME THAT

00:49:22.426 --> 00:49:24.061
IT'S GOOD FOR THE CONSUMER AND

00:49:24.127 --> 00:49:26.129
NOT NECESSARILY JUST GOOD.

00:49:26.196 --> 00:49:27.698
FOR THE MANUFACTURERS.

00:49:27.764 --> 00:49:29.900
AND SO FAR NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE

00:49:29.966 --> 00:49:31.635
TO PROVIDE THAT EVIDENCE TO ME

00:49:31.702 --> 00:49:31.935
[inaudible]

00:49:32.002 --> 00:49:34.304
YES MA'AM.

JUST BRINGING IT AT JUST

00:49:37.607 --> 00:49:39.676
BRINGING IT. TWENTY THIRTY YEARS

00:49:39.743 --> 00:49:41.745
LATER -- TO THE MARKET A COUPLE

00:49:41.812 --> 00:49:42.846
YEARS SOONER.

00:49:42.913 --> 00:49:44.448
IS NOT NECESSARILY PRO PRO

00:49:44.514 --> 00:49:45.882
COMPETITIVE CONSUMERS.

00:49:45.949 --> 00:49:48.051
YES MA'AM THANK YOU SENATOR AT

00:49:48.118 --> 00:49:50.120
AT THE HEART OF THIS IS IF THAT

00:49:50.187 --> 00:49:52.089
LITIGATION BETWEEN THE GENERIC

00:49:52.155 --> 00:49:53.523
AND THE BRAND WENT ALL THE WAY

00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:54.591
TO COURT.

00:49:54.658 --> 00:49:55.926
WHAT WOULD THE COURT DECIDE WITH

00:49:55.992 --> 00:49:57.928
THE COURT DECIDE THAT THE PATENT

00:49:57.994 --> 00:49:59.629
WAS VALID IN THERE FOR THE

00:49:59.696 --> 00:50:00.964
GENERIC HAD TO STAY OFF THE

00:50:01.031 --> 00:50:01.998
MARKET OR NOT?

00:50:02.065 --> 00:50:03.967
AND IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES

00:50:04.034 --> 00:50:05.936
WHEN THESE GO ALL THE WAY TO

00:50:06.002 --> 00:50:08.739
COURT BRAND MANUFACTURERS WHEN.

00:50:08.805 --> 00:50:11.641
AND SO THE GENERIC IS NOT ABLE

00:50:11.708 --> 00:50:13.410
TO COME TO MARKET INTEL THAT

00:50:13.477 --> 00:50:15.846
PATENT EXPIRES THE SETTLEMENTS --

00:50:15.912 --> 00:50:19.416
WHILE THE GENERIC TO COME TO

00:50:19.483 --> 00:50:21.718
MARKET SOONER.

00:50:21.785 --> 00:50:23.453
THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING TOO

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:25.555
THANK YOU AND THE OTHER IN.

00:50:25.622 --> 00:50:26.723

ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMITTEE A

00:50:28.425 --> 00:50:32.062
CENTERS ON OF A RECALL OF SO I I

THEIR OWN APPROVAL PROCESS FOR

00:51:02.058 --> 00:51:03.160

SEE THE EFFICACY -- OF OF

THE BENEFICIARY THE AWARD COULD

00:51:40.163 --> 00:51:40.630
BE SOMEONE OTHER THAN THE

PLAINTIFF?

00:51:42.165 --> 00:51:44.100
SO MY QUESTION COMING FROM A

00:51:44.167 --> 00:51:45.469

00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:52.042
OF ACTION.

00:51:52.108 --> 00:51:54.411
DOES THE STATE LAW.

00:51:54.478 --> 00:51:55.645
IF THIS COMES INTO LAW COME INTO

00:51:55.712 --> 00:51:56.947
EFFECT WHERE THE STATE BECOMES A

00:51:57.013 --> 00:51:59.282
BENEFICIARY OF ANY AWARD.

00:51:59.349 --> 00:52:00.951
OR IF IT'S FILED IN A FEDERAL

00:52:06.022 --> 00:52:08.625
AWARD.

00:52:08.692 --> 00:52:09.426
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION

00:52:09.493 --> 00:52:10.794
UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T HAVE AN

00:52:10.861 --> 00:52:13.330

MISTER CHAIR THROUGH THE CHAIR

00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:22.472
MICHAELA FOR SEE JACK BUDGET AND

00:52:22.539 --> 00:52:23.039
NO THEY'RE TURNING GENERAL'S

00:52:23.106 --> 00:52:26.109
OFFICE HAD AT THE FIRST ANSWER

00:52:26.176 --> 00:52:27.377
TO THAT QUESTION.

00:52:27.444 --> 00:52:28.945
RIGHT I UNDERSTAND THIS IS A

00:52:29.012 --> 00:52:30.814
STATE LAW I DON'T KNOW OKAY TAKE

00:52:30.881 --> 00:52:32.782
THIS A FEDERAL COURT I MEAN THE

00:52:32.849 --> 00:52:33.316
TO TO ADDRESS US OURSELVES

00:52:33.383 --> 00:52:33.950
QUESTION RIGHT YOU COULD BE IN

00:52:34.017 --> 00:52:35.986
FEDERAL COURT IF YOU PLAYED BOTH

00:52:36.052 --> 00:52:38.388
A FEDERAL ANTITRUST CASE.

00:52:38.455 --> 00:52:40.757
AS WELL AS THE STATE AND I TRUST

00:52:40.824 --> 00:52:41.358
CASE.

00:52:41.424 --> 00:52:44.995
OF THIS LAW WOULD GOVERN THE

00:52:45.061 --> 00:52:46.563
NINETY JUDICATA SAN.

00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:49.099
OF THE STATE CASE AND FEDERAL

00:52:49.165 --> 00:52:52.068
LAW WOULD GOVERN THE JUDICATA

00:52:52.135 --> 00:52:54.170
AND AT THE FEDERAL CASE SO UNDER

00:52:54.237 --> 00:52:56.439
THE FROM THE STATE -- LAW IT

00:52:56.506 --> 00:52:58.375
THIS FOR WORK WERE TO BECOME LAW --

00:52:58.441 --> 00:52:59.809
ANY PLAINTIFF TO GET RECEIVED AN

00:52:59.876 --> 00:53:01.912
AWARD THE STATE WOULD BE THE

00:53:01.978 --> 00:53:04.047
CUSTODIAN OF THAT AWARD CORRECT.

00:53:04.114 --> 00:53:06.016
WELL UNDER THIS LAW THE PENALTY

00:53:06.082 --> 00:53:11.488
ONLY A CRUISE TO THE ATTORNEY

00:53:11.555 --> 00:53:12.522
GENERAL.

00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:13.690
SO A PRIVATE PLAN F. COULD NOT

00:53:13.757 --> 00:53:15.759
CLAIM ANY PENALTIES UNDER ABA

00:53:15.825 --> 00:53:16.393
TWENTY WHY DO WE HAVE A PRIVATE

00:53:16.459 --> 00:53:17.494
RIGHT OF ACTION IF IT'S ETERNAL

00:53:17.561 --> 00:53:18.995
GENERAL IT'S BASICALLY THE

00:53:19.062 --> 00:53:20.830
BENEFICIARY OF ANY AWARDS.

00:53:20.897 --> 00:53:23.133
WHAT THE WE DO NOT CHANGE THE IT

00:53:23.199 --> 00:53:26.069
WE DO NOT CREATE A NEW PRIVATE

00:53:26.136 --> 00:53:28.438
CONSERVE ACTION?

00:53:28.505 --> 00:53:29.139
ASSEMBLY SO YOUR YOUR YOUR

00:53:29.205 --> 00:53:31.207
POSITION IS THERE IS NO PRIVATE

00:53:31.274 --> 00:53:33.643
RIGHT OF ACTION IN THIS BILL.

00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:34.244
NO THEY THERE IS THERE IS A

00:53:34.311 --> 00:53:34.811
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BUT

00:53:34.878 --> 00:53:36.112
THAT'S THE SAME AS THE EXISTING

00:53:36.179 --> 00:53:37.681
LAW UNDER THE CART RIGHT AT OKAY

00:53:37.747 --> 00:53:40.183
SO THEY CAN SEEK RELIEF AS SAME

00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:41.084
AS THEY WOULD UNDER THE CART

00:53:41.151 --> 00:53:42.786
RIGHTACT -- WHICH THEY'VE BEEN

00:53:42.852 --> 00:53:45.088
ABLE TO DO IN OTHER ANTI TRUST

00:53:45.155 --> 00:53:45.922
CASES AGAINST PHARMACEUTICAL

00:53:45.989 --> 00:53:46.623
COMPANIES.

00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:48.058
THE OTHER THING THAT WE'RE

00:53:48.124 --> 00:53:49.025
TALKING ABOUT IS THERE'S A

00:53:49.092 --> 00:53:50.827
PENALTY THAT ONLY THE ATTORNEY

00:53:50.894 --> 00:53:53.597
GENERAL CAN GO AFTER AND SEEK SO

00:53:53.663 --> 00:53:55.599
A PRIVATE PLAINTIFF CANNOT SEEK

00:53:55.665 --> 00:53:57.534
AS A MEANS OF RELIEF THAT

00:53:57.601 --> 00:53:59.069
PENALTY OKAY.

00:53:59.135 --> 00:54:01.304
I KNOW DRUGS I DON'T KNOW.

00:54:01.371 --> 00:54:02.505
EXCEPT THAT MISTER CHAIR.

00:54:02.572 --> 00:54:06.109
AGAIN I THINK THIS NEEDS FURTHER --

00:54:06.176 --> 00:54:07.777
IS GOING TO JIM MASTICATION --

00:54:07.844 --> 00:54:09.112
WE MIGHT BE TALKING ABOUT

00:54:09.179 --> 00:54:11.047
PENALTY VERSUS DAMAGES YOU CAN

00:54:11.114 --> 00:54:12.682
ALSO GET A CLAIM UNDER THE

00:54:12.749 --> 00:54:14.117
UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW.

00:54:14.184 --> 00:54:16.286
AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT HAS

00:54:16.353 --> 00:54:18.288
TO GO TO THE STATE SO WE MAY BE

00:54:18.355 --> 00:54:20.724
TALKING ABOUT DIFFERENT TYPES OF

00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:21.925
RELIEF.

00:54:21.992 --> 00:54:23.860
CAN I JUST ADDRESS AT ONE POINT --

00:54:23.927 --> 00:54:25.595
WE'VE EXPLICITLY SET IN THE BILL

00:54:25.662 --> 00:54:26.763
THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAN

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:29.599
ONLY RECOVER PENALTIES ONCE SO --

00:54:29.666 --> 00:54:31.601
WE WOULDN'T WE WOULDN'T WE COULD

00:54:31.668 --> 00:54:33.269
EITHER GET THE PENALTIES AS THEY

00:54:33.336 --> 00:54:34.304
ARE IN THE BILL OR UNDER YOU SEE

00:54:34.371 --> 00:54:35.605

00:54:35.672 --> 00:54:36.873
SPECIFICALLY TO THAT.

00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:38.742
RIGHT OKAY ALL RIGHT SO I'D THAT

00:54:38.808 --> 00:54:40.377
AND THIS IS HEALTH COMMITTEE --

00:54:40.443 --> 00:54:41.544
OTHER I REALIZE IT'S REALLY

00:54:41.611 --> 00:54:43.146
IMPORTANT TO THIS BILL PERHAPS

00:54:43.213 --> 00:54:44.648

IN OUR MIND -- THAT -- I'M NOT

00:56:58.948 --> 00:57:00.383
DOING A ROYAL WE I'M DIANE.

00:57:00.450 --> 00:57:01.918
COLLECTED BY STAFF THAT -- SO WE

00:57:01.985 --> 00:57:03.253
HAVE SOMETHING SO FOR EXAMPLE

00:57:03.319 --> 00:57:04.954
ALLOWING A GENERIC TO COME THE

00:57:05.021 --> 00:57:07.056
MARKET EARLIER IS OF SOMETHING

00:57:07.123 --> 00:57:09.826
OF VALUE TO THE GENERIC BUT THAT

00:57:09.893 --> 00:57:11.261
IS THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF WHAT

00:57:11.327 --> 00:57:13.396
WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE SO THAT

00:57:13.463 --> 00:57:14.931
SHOULD NOT BE COUNTED AGAINST --

00:57:14.998 --> 00:57:17.033
THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY THAT

00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:17.834
THEY OFFERED THAT IN A

00:57:17.901 --> 00:57:19.202
SETTLEMENT RATE THAT'S ACTUALLY

00:57:19.269 --> 00:57:20.970
WHAT WE WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN.

00:57:21.037 --> 00:57:23.173
RIGHT -- BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SOME

00:57:23.239 --> 00:57:25.308
LITIGATION -- RELEASED BECAUSE

00:57:25.375 --> 00:57:27.377
OF THE EXPENSE THAT THE GENERIC

00:57:27.443 --> 00:57:28.812
HAD TO PUT UP TO THE NATIONALLY

00:57:28.878 --> 00:57:32.115
PURSUE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED --

00:57:32.182 --> 00:57:36.052
THE IDEA THAT IT'S A DEAD OR FOR

00:57:36.119 --> 00:57:38.454
GIVING AND YET -- COSTS THAT

00:57:38.521 --> 00:57:40.023
WERE SO SO WE PUT THOSE ARE THE

00:57:40.089 --> 00:57:40.924
AMENDMENTS -- SO WE WANT TO

00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:43.326
CREATE SOME CLARIFICATION AS TO

00:57:43.393 --> 00:57:45.228
THINGS THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED

00:57:45.295 --> 00:57:47.797
A VALUABLE BUT REALLY ARE IN

00:57:47.864 --> 00:57:49.232
LINE WITH I THINK THE GOAL OF

00:57:49.299 --> 00:57:51.801
THE POLICY WHICH IS TO TRY.

00:57:51.868 --> 00:57:53.102
TO CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

00:57:53.169 --> 00:57:54.737

REGARDING RATE SETTING.

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:32.889

01:01:33.556 --> 01:01:34.424
THIS ISSUE.

01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:35.691
I'VE AGREED TO TAKE AMENDMENTS

01:01:35.758 --> 01:01:37.527
THAT PROVIDE ARBITRATION AS AN

01:01:37.593 --> 01:01:39.495
OPTION TO THE DEFAULT MEDICARE

01:01:39.562 --> 01:01:40.930
RATES SO THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY

01:01:40.997 --> 01:01:43.099
FOR PROVIDERS TO MAKE A CASE.

01:01:43.166 --> 01:01:45.001
FOR AN ALTERNATIVE HIGHER RATE.

01:01:45.068 --> 01:01:46.202
I BELIEVE THIS PROCESS WITH RIDE

01:01:46.269 --> 01:01:47.236
AN ALTERNATE TO MARKET

01:01:47.303 --> 01:01:48.504
CONTROLLED BY A LIMITED NUMBER

01:01:48.571 --> 01:01:50.339
OF COMPANIES THAT DISTORTS THE

01:01:50.406 --> 01:01:51.641
REIMBURSEMENT CONTRACTING

01:01:51.707 --> 01:01:53.376
PROCESS WHILE OFFERING PROVIDERS

01:01:53.443 --> 01:01:55.545
AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A CASE

01:01:55.611 --> 01:01:56.112
FOR WHY THE RATES SHOULD BE

01:01:56.179 --> 01:01:57.647
HIGHER.

01:01:57.713 --> 01:01:59.082
I WILL ALSO BE TAKING AMENDMENTS

01:01:59.148 --> 01:02:00.249
TO ADDRESS THE CONCERN ADDRESSED

01:02:00.316 --> 01:02:02.552
BY THE OPPOSITION THAT ANY COST

01:02:02.618 --> 01:02:04.253
SAVINGS OBTAIN IN THE BILL WILL

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:05.588
JUST ADD TO CAN INSURANCE

01:02:05.655 --> 01:02:08.424
COMPANY PROFITS THEY WON'T AS AB

01:02:08.491 --> 01:02:09.759
AFTER WE GET DONE I HOPE.

01:02:09.826 --> 01:02:10.993
THE BILL THE FINES AND REAP AND

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:12.095
PLACES REQUIREMENTS ON

01:02:12.161 --> 01:02:13.863
FINANCIALLY INTERESTED PROVIDERS

01:02:13.930 --> 01:02:16.032
THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY MAKE

01:02:16.099 --> 01:02:17.767
PREMIUM PAYMENTS FOR CONSUMERS --

01:02:17.834 --> 01:02:19.936
INSURANCE WITH THE OBJECTIVE AND

01:02:20.002 --> 01:02:21.370
OF ENHANCING PROFITS.

01:02:21.437 --> 01:02:23.139
HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS ARE READY

01:02:23.206 --> 01:02:24.507
TOO EXPENSIVE FOR MANY PEOPLE

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:25.842
AND GIMMICKS BY PROVIDERS ARE

01:02:25.908 --> 01:02:26.642
USED TO ENSURE THAT

01:02:26.709 --> 01:02:28.077
REIMBURSEMENT RATES ARE HIGHER

01:02:28.144 --> 01:02:29.312
THAN THEY SHOULD BE.

01:02:29.378 --> 01:02:31.080
I BELIEVE IT'S TIME FOR THE

01:02:31.147 --> 01:02:32.148
LEGISLATURE TO INTERVENE.

01:02:32.215 --> 01:02:33.416
THE BILL WILL PREVENT PROVIDERS

01:02:33.483 --> 01:02:34.784
FROM GAMING THE SYSTEM AS A

01:02:34.851 --> 01:02:36.052
MECHANISM TO ARTIFICIALLY

01:02:36.119 --> 01:02:38.421
GENERATE THREE TO FOUR TIMES THE

01:02:38.488 --> 01:02:40.256
MEDICARE RATE PROVIDING THE SAME

01:02:40.323 --> 01:02:41.424
EXACT CARE THEY PROVIDE TO

01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:42.525
EVERYONE ELSE.

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:44.026
WHY YOU HAVE ALREADY PROBABLY

01:02:44.093 --> 01:02:45.528
ALREADY HEARD ARGUMENTS AND EVEN

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:47.130
ADD TO SCARE PATIENTS ABOUT THE

01:02:47.196 --> 01:02:48.030
SYSTEM?

01:02:48.097 --> 01:02:49.866
THAT HOW THE SYSTEM OF CARE WILL

01:02:49.932 --> 01:02:51.467
COLLAPSE IF THIS BILL PASSES OR

01:02:51.534 --> 01:02:53.102
HOW TERRIBLE FOUNDATIONS NEED TO

01:02:53.169 --> 01:02:55.138
SEE SUCH -- PROVIDING ASSISTANCE

01:02:55.204 --> 01:02:56.572
IN CALIFORNIA I REMAIN

01:02:56.639 --> 01:02:58.207
UNCONVINCED THAT THESE THE

01:02:58.274 --> 01:02:59.175
LIMITED NUMBER OF PATIENTS

01:02:59.242 --> 01:03:01.010
RECEIVING ASSISTANCE UNDER THIS

01:03:01.077 --> 01:03:02.879
PROGRAM WILL FUNDAMENTALLY

01:03:02.945 --> 01:03:04.347
DISRUPT THE CARE THEY RECEIVE.

01:03:04.413 --> 01:03:05.915
AS FOR TERRIBLE SYSTEMS

01:03:05.982 --> 01:03:06.682
WITHDRAWING FROM THE CALIFORNIA

01:03:06.749 --> 01:03:07.984
MARKET THERE'S CERTAINLY A

01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:09.952
DIFFERENCE OF OF OF OF OPINION

ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE SOME WHO

THIS BILL BASED ON THE RATE

01:15:43.572 --> 01:15:45.774
SETTING COMPONENT THAT HAS BEEN --

01:15:45.841 --> 01:15:46.642
IN THIS BILL THROUGHOUT THE

WE DO REMAIN IN OPPOSITION AND

UNFORTUNATELY ACTUALLY BELIEVE

01:15:56.418 --> 01:15:58.020
THESE AMENDMENTS MAKE THE BILL

01:15:58.086 --> 01:16:00.689
WORSE.

01:16:00.756 --> 01:16:03.091
SO IT SEEMS THAT THEY AMENDMENTS

01:16:03.158 --> 01:16:05.594
WERE MODELED AFTER AB.

01:16:05.661 --> 01:16:06.662
SEVENTY TWO WHICH WAS A BILL

01:16:06.728 --> 01:16:08.931
THAT WAS NEGOTIATED WITH CMA IN

01:16:08.997 --> 01:16:12.401
AN ATTEMPT -- TO FIX A SITUATION

01:16:12.467 --> 01:16:14.136
IN WHICH THERE WAS NO AGREEMENT

01:16:14.202 --> 01:16:16.371
ON RATES.

01:16:16.438 --> 01:16:17.439
FOR PATIENTS THAT WE'RE OUT OF

01:16:17.506 --> 01:16:18.974
NETWORK SO YOU HAVE A PATIENT

01:16:19.041 --> 01:16:20.909
THAT BECAUSE THE DOCTOR OUT OF

01:16:20.976 --> 01:16:21.610
NETWORK.

01:16:21.677 --> 01:16:25.180
THE SENATE BILL FOR A SERVICE AT

01:16:25.247 --> 01:16:26.515
A RATE THAT THE HEALTH PLAN DID

01:16:26.581 --> 01:16:28.216
NOT AGREE TO THE HEALTH PLAN

01:16:28.283 --> 01:16:29.952
PAYS THE PAYMENTS AT A RATE THAT

01:16:30.018 --> 01:16:31.853
THE PROVIDER DIDN'T AGREE TO AND

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:32.654
THE PATIENT IS STUCK IN THE

01:16:32.721 --> 01:16:34.990
MIDDLE -- THE SOLUTION FOR THAT

01:16:35.057 --> 01:16:36.825
PROCESS WAS TO HAVE AN INTERIM

01:16:36.892 --> 01:16:39.962
PAYMENT OF A 125% OF MEDICARE.

01:16:40.028 --> 01:16:42.597
THAT WAS NEGOTIATED ON IN

01:16:42.664 --> 01:16:44.032
AGREEMENT WITH ALL PARTIES

01:16:44.099 --> 01:16:46.935
BECAUSE THERE WAS NO AGREEMENT

01:16:47.002 --> 01:16:47.869
TO THAT RATE.

01:16:47.936 --> 01:16:49.338
WHAT IS THAT PROCESS IS BEING

01:16:49.404 --> 01:16:52.708
PLACE TO SB TWENTY FOUR FOUR

01:16:52.774 --> 01:16:54.176
SITUATION THAT WE THINK IS

01:16:54.242 --> 01:16:55.811
ACTUALLY THE OPPOSITE OF THAT?

01:16:55.877 --> 01:16:57.846
IN THIS SITUATION THEIR PATIENTS

01:16:57.913 --> 01:16:59.381
TRYING TO CONTINUE THEIR

01:16:59.448 --> 01:17:01.416
COMMERCIAL COVERAGE THEY HAVE

01:17:01.483 --> 01:17:03.151
BEEN PAYING THEIR PREMIUM AT A

01:17:03.218 --> 01:17:04.086
RATE.

01:17:04.152 --> 01:17:06.922
THERE IS AN AGREEMENT ALREADY ON

01:17:06.989 --> 01:17:08.724
THAT PROVIDER RATE BETWEEN THE

01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:10.726
HEALTH PLAN BETWEEN THE PATIENT

01:17:10.792 --> 01:17:12.494
THERE'S A CONTRACT IN PLACE AND

01:17:12.561 --> 01:17:13.996
WHAT THAT RATE IS.

01:17:14.062 --> 01:17:15.330
BECAUSE THE PATIENT CAN NO

01:17:15.397 --> 01:17:17.265
LONGER PAY THEIR PREMIUM AND A

01:17:17.332 --> 01:17:18.633
THIRD PARTY IS PAYING IT.

01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:20.335
THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THE HEALTH

01:17:20.402 --> 01:17:22.170
PLAN TO THEN GET OUT OF THAT

01:17:22.237 --> 01:17:23.171
CONTRACT.

01:17:23.238 --> 01:17:25.240
HEY RAY AT A MEDICARE RATE WHICH

01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:27.809
IS WHAT WE'VE HEARD IS NEGATIVE

01:17:27.876 --> 01:17:30.579
1% OF THE ACTUAL COST.

01:17:30.645 --> 01:17:31.780
AND THERE'S NOTHING TO MY

01:17:31.847 --> 01:17:33.382
KNOWLEDGE IN THE IN THE

01:17:33.448 --> 01:17:34.783
AMENDMENTS THAT REQUIRE

01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:37.786
REIMBURSEMENTS -- OF PREMIUMS

01:17:37.853 --> 01:17:39.921
FOR THAT NEGOTIATED RISK THAT

01:17:39.988 --> 01:17:41.590
WAS AND PUT IN PLACE FOR ALL OF

01:17:41.656 --> 01:17:43.658
THE PREMIUMS THERE'S NOTHING AND

01:17:43.725 --> 01:17:45.093
AMENDMENTS THAT REQUIRE THE

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:46.895
PREMIUMS TO GO DOWN IF THERE IS

01:17:46.962 --> 01:17:48.230
A COST SAVINGS.

01:17:48.296 --> 01:17:49.464
WHAT WE'RE AWARE OF IS IT DOES

01:17:49.531 --> 01:17:51.800
REQUIRE THE THE PROVIDER TO TAKE

01:17:51.867 --> 01:17:53.135
THIS INTO RIGHT AT MEDICARE AND

01:17:53.201 --> 01:17:54.870

WHAT NINETY SEVEN DASH ONE SAYS.

01:33:29.470 --> 01:33:30.972
TO DO SO WOULD PUT US IN GRAVE

01:33:31.038 --> 01:33:32.306

82% OF THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FUNDS

01:43:07.447 --> 01:43:10.183

01:43:56.430 --> 01:43:57.464
EVEN.

01:43:57.531 --> 01:43:59.333
YOU KNOW CHARACTERIZES DONATIONS

ORGANIZATION WITHIN THE IRS GETS.

01:44:23.323 --> 01:44:25.158
CURIOUS TO SAY THE LEAST ABOUT

01:44:25.225 --> 01:44:27.260
YOUR DAUGHTER AND THE NONPROFIT

01:44:27.327 --> 01:44:28.762

INVOLVED WITH THIS NONPROFIT

01:44:47.648 --> 01:44:48.849
ORGANIZATION THE ACTUAL

01:44:48.915 --> 01:44:50.384
MECHANISM IS NOT THAT THE

01:44:50.450 --> 01:44:53.320

SO THEY WILL PAY THAT'S THAT'S

01:44:59.626 --> 01:45:01.395
WHY WE SEE THE HEALTH INSURANCE

01:45:01.461 --> 01:45:02.696
PLANS HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE

01:45:02.763 --> 01:45:03.530

AND IF IF IF I MIGHT ADD TO THAT.

01:51:45.598 --> 01:51:47.767
I FEEL THAT I MUST DEFEND THE

01:51:47.834 --> 01:51:48.868
REPUTATION OF THE AMERICAN

01:51:48.935 --> 01:51:51.137
KIDNEY FUN I AGREE FULLY WE'VE

01:51:51.204 --> 01:51:53.173
GOT TO GET THE FACTS ON THE

01:51:53.239 --> 01:51:54.741
TABLE.

01:51:54.808 --> 01:51:56.609
OF THE THE THE UNIQUENESS OF THE

01:51:56.676 --> 01:51:58.011
I. G. OPINION AND THE

01:51:58.078 --> 01:52:00.013
ARRANGEMENT THAT IT DESCRIBES

01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:02.182
MAKE SURE THAT WE TREAT ALL

01:52:02.248 --> 01:52:03.583
PROVIDERS THE SAME.

01:52:03.650 --> 01:52:05.452
OF THE PROVIDERS WHO ACTUALLY

01:52:05.518 --> 01:52:07.387
REFER PATIENTS TO THE AMERICAN

01:52:07.454 --> 01:52:10.156
KIDNEY FUN 40% OF THEM DO NOT

01:52:10.223 --> 01:52:11.558
CONTRIBUTE AT ALL.

01:52:11.624 --> 01:52:13.393
WE MUST PROVIDE GRANTS IN THE

01:52:13.460 --> 01:52:15.428
ORDER THAT WE RECEIVE THE GRANT

01:52:15.495 --> 01:52:20.834
APPLICATIONS AND WE MUST NOT

01:52:20.900 --> 01:52:22.502
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ANY.

01:52:22.569 --> 01:52:24.137
OUR PATIENTS WHO SEES A PROVIDER

01:52:24.204 --> 01:52:25.905
ALL WHO DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE AND

01:52:25.972 --> 01:52:26.706
WE HAVE NEVER DISCONTINUED.

01:52:26.773 --> 01:52:29.742
ALL THE IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT.

01:52:29.809 --> 01:52:31.311
TO UNDERSTAND THAT IF WE PULL

01:52:31.377 --> 01:52:33.313
OUT OF CALIFORNIA YES WE ARE

01:52:33.379 --> 01:52:35.748
PULLING OUT OF ALL PROGRAMS

01:52:35.815 --> 01:52:37.417
BECAUSE AGAIN THAT IS THE WAY

01:52:37.484 --> 01:52:39.252
THE OPINION IS WRITTEN THAT WE

01:52:39.319 --> 01:52:40.987
DEAL WITH ALL INSURANCE.

01:52:41.054 --> 01:52:42.122
AND ALL HEALTH COVERAGE ON AN

01:52:42.188 --> 01:52:44.357
EQUAL BASIS SO WE CAN'T JUST

01:52:44.424 --> 01:52:46.192
DEAL WITH ASSISTING PEOPLE FOR

01:52:46.259 --> 01:52:47.760
MEDICARE BUT IGNORING OTHER

01:52:47.827 --> 01:52:49.062
COVERAGE THAT'S AVAILABLE.

01:52:49.129 --> 01:52:52.565
THESE ARE NOT CHOICES THAT WE

01:52:52.632 --> 01:52:53.967
HAVE THEY ARE REQUIREMENTS.

01:52:54.033 --> 01:52:55.602
SO AND I GUESS MY NEXT QUESTION

01:52:55.668 --> 01:52:57.570
IS IS ANYBODY FROM FEES FOR CDS

01:52:57.637 --> 01:52:59.439
OR PERSON IS OR DE VITA TELL YOU

01:52:59.506 --> 01:53:00.373
WHO TO GIVE.

01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:03.076

OPINION SAYS THIS.

01:53:19.292 --> 01:53:20.860
CAN THE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY

01:53:20.927 --> 01:53:23.963
EXPECTATION OF ANY RETURN FOR

WHAT THEY CONTRIBUTE TO THE FUN

01:53:25.965 --> 01:53:28.368
THE MONEY GOES INTO A SINGLE

01:57:14.127 --> 01:57:18.131
THAT IS THE ISSUE OF V. -- OF

01:57:18.197 --> 01:57:20.466
BASICALLY A PROVIDER AND BY THE

01:57:20.533 --> 01:57:21.601
WAY I'M A PROVIDER SO I HAVE A

01:57:21.667 --> 01:57:23.870
PROVIDER AL THAT -- IF PROVIDER

01:57:23.936 --> 01:57:25.872
SAYING THAT WELL YOU KNOW WHAT

01:57:25.938 --> 01:57:27.306
WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT.

01:57:27.373 --> 01:57:29.776
IF I CAN PAY THE IN I HAVE A

01:57:29.842 --> 01:57:31.310
PARTICULARLY GOOD DEAL WITH A

01:57:31.377 --> 01:57:33.079
PARTICULAR INSURANCE COMPANY OR

01:57:33.146 --> 01:57:34.247
SEVEN TURNS COMPANIES.

01:57:34.313 --> 01:57:36.449
AND I CAN FIND A WAY TO HAVE

01:57:36.516 --> 01:57:38.151
SOMEONE YOU KNOW THAT THAT I CAN

01:57:38.217 --> 01:57:39.285
PAY FOR THE FOR YOU KNOW CHANNEL

01:57:39.352 --> 01:57:40.853
MONEY NOT NECESSARY FOR THAT

01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:41.854
PARTICULAR PATIENT EVEN

01:57:41.921 --> 01:57:43.656
STATISTICALLY SEND MONEY TO A

01:57:43.723 --> 01:57:44.757
FOUNDATION THAT WILL THEN PAY

01:57:44.824 --> 01:57:45.992
THAT PREMIUM BECAUSE THE

01:57:46.058 --> 01:57:48.227
PREMIUMS ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF

01:57:48.294 --> 01:57:49.896
THE ACTUAL.

01:57:49.962 --> 01:57:51.664
REIMBURSEMENT RIGHT SO NOW

01:57:51.731 --> 01:57:53.900
STATES 20% RIGHT SO WHAT HAPPENS

01:57:53.966 --> 01:57:55.401
AT THE FIVE FOLD RETURN.

01:57:55.468 --> 01:57:56.903
SO I CAN GET SOME MONEY AND

01:57:56.969 --> 01:57:58.805
WHETHER AT AND SO FORTH AND THEN

01:57:58.871 --> 01:58:01.274
I CAN PUT MONEY INTO THAT.

01:58:01.340 --> 01:58:03.009
AND THEN I GET PAID FIVE TIMES

01:58:03.075 --> 01:58:04.444
ISN'T THAT STRONG DOWN THE RISK

01:58:04.510 --> 01:58:05.978
FULL FOR THE INSURANCE COMPANY

01:58:06.045 --> 01:58:07.046
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING WE IN

01:58:07.113 --> 01:58:09.248
POLICY WOULD WANT TO ENCOURAGE

01:58:09.315 --> 01:58:11.884
ALL RIGHT SO THAT'S SO THAT'S

01:58:11.951 --> 01:58:14.220
THE OVERALL IT SO THAT'S WHEN IT.

01:58:14.287 --> 01:58:20.359
THE OVERALL ISSUES NOW -- I WANT

01:58:20.426 --> 01:58:22.028
TO ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT.

01:58:22.094 --> 01:58:23.896
A CHAOS AND IT DOES HAVE -- YOU

01:58:23.963 --> 01:58:24.964
KNOW THEY DO NOT ENGAGE IN

01:58:25.031 --> 01:58:26.699
STEERAGE -- WHICH I KNOW THE

01:58:26.766 --> 01:58:27.300
OTHER FIRST OF ALL -- YOU AND

01:58:27.366 --> 01:58:29.001
ALLOW IT BUT ALSO WE DON'T YOU

01:58:29.068 --> 01:58:29.202
KNOW.

01:58:29.268 --> 01:58:32.472
ETCETERA IT IS MORE BILL IT IS --

01:58:32.538 --> 01:58:33.606
THEY HAVE PLAYED THINGS IN PLACE

01:58:33.673 --> 01:58:34.507
YOU HEARD ABOUT SOME OF THEM

01:58:34.574 --> 01:58:36.175
THAT PROTECTED BUT THERE'S ALSO

01:58:36.242 --> 01:58:37.777
THE CHALLENGE OF IS THAT WHEN

01:58:37.844 --> 01:58:39.812
80% OF YOUR MONEY COMES FROM THE

01:58:39.879 --> 01:58:41.180
SENSUALLY.

01:58:41.247 --> 01:58:45.418
THE TO THE LARGEST PROVIDERS --

01:58:45.485 --> 01:58:46.919
THEY'RE NOT AMY A PARTICULAR

01:58:46.986 --> 01:58:48.087
PATIENT RIGHT THAT'S ALL BLINDED

01:58:48.154 --> 01:58:49.288
AND SO FORTH BUT THE PROBLEM

01:58:49.355 --> 01:58:51.791
DOES RAISE SOME QUESTIONS OF

01:58:51.858 --> 01:58:53.860
WELL STATISTICALLY OF IGAVE

01:58:53.926 --> 01:58:54.627
SOME MONEY I KNOW I'M GOING TO

01:58:54.694 --> 01:58:56.295
GET LIKE A TWO THREE FOLDER FOR

01:58:56.362 --> 01:58:58.631
FOLDER RETURNED FROM DOING THIS

01:58:58.698 --> 01:59:01.400
FROM BUT MONEY PUT IN AND I'M.

01:59:01.467 --> 01:59:02.802
40% OF MARKET LET'S SAY.

01:59:02.869 --> 01:59:04.871
GOOD CHANCE THAT I'M GOING TO DO

01:59:04.937 --> 01:59:05.771
BETTER THAN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

01:59:05.838 --> 01:59:07.473
TO PUT AN END SO THAT WAS AN

01:59:07.540 --> 01:59:09.742
ISSUE THAT WE WANT TO TRY.

01:59:09.809 --> 01:59:11.878
TO FIGURE OUT IS AS WELL NOT TO

01:59:11.944 --> 01:59:13.679
HAVE SO IT'S GOOD THAT'S MORE OF

01:59:13.746 --> 01:59:15.214
A STATISTICAL THING BECAUSE THEY

01:59:15.281 --> 01:59:17.016
DO NOT GET GAUGE ON THE VERY

01:59:17.083 --> 01:59:18.784
CLEAR A K. F. DOES NOT ENGAGE WE

01:59:18.851 --> 01:59:20.486
DO NOT SEE ANY EVIDENCE OF AND

01:59:20.553 --> 01:59:21.821
THEY DO NOT.

01:59:21.888 --> 01:59:22.622
ENGAGE IN LIKE -- WELL GUESS

01:59:22.688 --> 01:59:24.357
WHAT YOU KNOW SOMEBODY GIVES THE

01:59:24.423 --> 01:59:26.158
MONEY AND THEN THAT PARTICULAR

01:59:26.225 --> 01:59:27.260
PATIENT GOES TO THAT THE

01:59:27.326 --> 01:59:28.895
PROVIDER THEY ARE BLIND TO THAT

01:59:28.961 --> 01:59:29.862
THAT'S A MONDAY NIGHT STAY OUR

01:59:29.929 --> 01:59:31.163
BLINDS YOU KNOW THEY GET THE

01:59:31.230 --> 01:59:32.798
MONEY THEY GIVE IT TO SOMEONE

01:59:32.865 --> 01:59:33.533
THEY THAT PERSON GOES.

01:59:33.599 --> 01:59:35.301
A PROVIDER THEY ARE NOT DIRECTED

01:59:35.368 --> 01:59:36.402
TO WHICH PROVIDER TO GOING TO

01:59:36.469 --> 01:59:37.637
THEY'RE NOT DIRECTING.

01:59:37.703 --> 01:59:39.839
EXACTLY -- WHICH INSURANCE

01:59:39.906 --> 01:59:42.375
COMPANY THAT SPECIFICALLY IT'S

01:59:42.441 --> 01:59:43.743
THE PATIENTS I SO THERE ARE

01:59:43.809 --> 01:59:45.778
THOSE PROTECTIONS IN PLACE BUT

01:59:45.845 --> 01:59:48.014
THAT BUT THAT DOES AND I THINK

01:59:48.080 --> 01:59:50.182
WHAT YOU HEAR IS IS THAT.

01:59:50.249 --> 01:59:52.652
THE PROBLEM IS WHAT THE WHEN THE

01:59:52.718 --> 01:59:54.053
IS THAT.

01:59:54.120 --> 01:59:55.254
AN ARRANGEMENT DIG THIS THE THE

01:59:55.321 --> 01:59:56.188
CHALLENGE TO OUR HEALTHCARE

01:59:56.255 --> 01:59:57.823
SYSTEM AND WE TALK ABOUT RAISING

01:59:57.890 --> 01:59:59.992
OVERALL PREMIUMS IS IS ABOUT.

02:00:00.059 --> 02:00:01.460
IS IS THAT YOU REALLY LEVERAGING

02:00:01.527 --> 02:00:03.529
THE RISK POOL WHICH IS BASICALLY

02:00:03.596 --> 02:00:05.097
ALL OF US WHO PRIDE FIVE

02:00:05.164 --> 02:00:07.199
INSURANCE WELL PAYING IN AND AND

02:00:07.266 --> 02:00:08.701
SO WHEN WE GET SICK WE IT

02:00:08.768 --> 02:00:09.569
COVERED RIGHT.

02:00:09.635 --> 02:00:11.070
SO THE CHALLENGES THAT WHAT

02:00:11.137 --> 02:00:11.737
HAPPENS IS WHEN YOU HAVE A PLACE

02:00:11.804 --> 02:00:13.673
YOU KNOW WHO'S ALREADY EXPENSIVE

02:00:13.739 --> 02:00:15.608
FIGURING YOU HAS NEEDS I SHOULD

02:00:15.675 --> 02:00:15.775
SAY.

02:00:15.841 --> 02:00:17.476
GRADY HAS NEEDS AND THEN SOMEONE

02:00:17.543 --> 02:00:18.778
SAYS WELL YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE A

02:00:18.844 --> 02:00:21.747
PRETTY GOOD POWER TO NEGOTIATE

02:00:21.814 --> 02:00:22.281
WITH THE HEALTH INSURANCE

02:00:22.348 --> 02:00:22.848
COMPANY BECAUSE IT'S ONLY.

02:00:22.915 --> 02:00:24.617
WERE VERY BIG PLAYER AND WE MAY

02:00:24.684 --> 02:00:26.519
BE THE ONLY DIALYSIS OR WHATEVER

02:00:26.586 --> 02:00:27.987
PROVIDER AT THAT PARTICULAR

02:00:28.054 --> 02:00:29.422
SERVICE IN THE AREA.%

02:00:29.488 --> 02:00:30.723
IT'S REALLY HARD FOR THE INSURER

02:00:30.790 --> 02:00:31.991
TO NEGOTIATE WITH NOW WE GOT A

02:00:32.058 --> 02:00:33.593
GOOD RATE AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS

02:00:33.659 --> 02:00:35.861
IS THAT WELL THE PROBLEM IS A

02:00:35.928 --> 02:00:37.029
PATIENT CAN'T.

02:00:37.096 --> 02:00:39.665
YOU KNOW THE CAN OF THE DAY

02:00:39.732 --> 02:00:40.800
BASICALLY YOU COULD EITHER DO

02:00:40.866 --> 02:00:42.535
PUBLIC INSURANCE MEDICARE OR

02:00:42.602 --> 02:00:43.436
PRIVATE INSURANCE AND PRIVATE

02:00:43.502 --> 02:00:44.971
INSURANCE PAYS A LOT MORE AND SO

02:00:45.037 --> 02:00:46.806
I CAN PAY A LITTLE BIT AND I GET

02:00:46.872 --> 02:00:47.440
A LOT MORE.

02:00:47.506 --> 02:00:55.948
THAT'S THAT'S ON THE BACKS OF

02:00:56.015 --> 02:00:56.749
ACTUALLY.

02:00:56.816 --> 02:00:57.516
ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE PAYING INTO

02:00:57.583 --> 02:00:58.351
THE INSURANCE AND I THINK THAT'S

02:00:58.417 --> 02:01:02.521
THE ISSUE WERE TRYING TO ADDRESS --

02:01:02.588 --> 02:01:03.689
BUT I WILL PERHAPS I SHOULD TURN

02:01:03.756 --> 02:01:05.524
IT TO THE AUTHOR TO SEE YOU TO

02:01:05.591 --> 02:01:07.493
IN TERMS OF THAT HE'S TRYING TO

02:01:07.560 --> 02:01:08.127
ADDRESS THIS AND WE WILL TRY TO

02:01:08.194 --> 02:01:09.028
WORK OUT AMENDMENTS TO TRY TO TO

02:01:09.095 --> 02:01:09.562
TO DEAL WITH.

02:01:09.629 --> 02:01:11.831
SO -- AND WE DO HAVE A MAN IS A

02:01:11.897 --> 02:01:13.199
SPECIFICALLY SAY KNOWS DURING

02:01:13.265 --> 02:01:15.534
WHICH AGAIN I KNOW A TF DOES NOT

02:01:15.601 --> 02:01:16.902
DO THAT KNOWS DURING BY THE AT

02:01:16.969 --> 02:01:17.970
AND BUT NO STRING BY THE

02:01:18.037 --> 02:01:19.405
FACILITY ITSELF REQUIRES

02:01:19.472 --> 02:01:20.773
FACILITIES TO POST INFORMATION

02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:21.974
WHERE CONSUMERS CAN GO TO GET

02:01:22.041 --> 02:01:23.409
OBJECTIVE INFORMATION ABOUT

02:01:23.476 --> 02:01:23.743
MEDICARE SO.

02:01:23.809 --> 02:01:26.412
THEY ACTUALLY HAVE.

02:01:26.479 --> 02:01:28.214
ACTORS INFORMATION.

02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:29.749
SO AND I PERHAPS YOU DO AND IF

02:01:29.815 --> 02:01:31.851
YOU WANNA BUT THE AUTHOR ALSO

02:01:31.917 --> 02:01:32.885
TRY TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS ALL

02:01:32.952 --> 02:01:33.419
THAT BECAUSE THANK YOU MY

02:01:33.486 --> 02:01:34.053
QUESTION -- WELL SO RIGHT NOW I

02:01:34.120 --> 02:01:35.021
HAVE A COUPLE OF CONCERNS ONLY

02:01:35.087 --> 02:01:37.723
BECAUSE WHEN I I HEARD TO SAY

02:01:37.790 --> 02:01:38.324
RIGHT NOW ABOUT.

02:01:38.391 --> 02:01:40.159
THAT ARE THE FOUNDATION DOESN'T

02:01:40.226 --> 02:01:41.127
DIRECTLY.

02:01:41.193 --> 02:01:42.495
GET INVOLVED IN AND I DON'T

02:01:42.561 --> 02:01:43.696
DISAGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES

02:01:43.763 --> 02:01:45.698
ABOUT TALKING ABOUT THE PROFIT

02:01:45.765 --> 02:01:47.900
AND AND THE OTHER TWO ARE

02:01:47.967 --> 02:01:49.935
TARGETS THAT BEEN MENTIONED HERE

02:01:50.002 --> 02:01:53.572
WHICH IS I BELIEVE DE VITA AND

02:01:53.639 --> 02:01:56.175
PRESSING AS BUT I ALMOST FEEL

02:01:56.242 --> 02:01:57.343
LIKE THEY WERE PENALIZING THE

02:01:57.410 --> 02:01:58.744
FOUNDATION.

02:01:58.811 --> 02:01:59.979
AND THE ATTEMPT OF OF OF GOING

02:02:00.046 --> 02:02:02.314
AFTER THESE OTHER YOU KNOW.

02:02:02.381 --> 02:02:04.150
RECEIVED ABOUT PLAYERS AND WHEN

02:02:04.216 --> 02:02:05.451
I HEARD THE NUMBER RIGHT NOW

02:02:05.518 --> 02:02:09.588
THAT 40% OF OTHER PROVIDERS ALSO

02:02:09.655 --> 02:02:11.057
SEND PATIENTS TO YOU.

02:02:11.123 --> 02:02:12.491
AND THESE OTHER 40% PROVIDERS

02:02:12.558 --> 02:02:14.260
DON'T CONTRIBUTE TO THE

02:02:14.326 --> 02:02:15.194
FOUNDATION.

02:02:15.261 --> 02:02:17.163
AND SO I SEE THAT THAT'S ALSO

02:02:17.229 --> 02:02:18.531
REALLY HIGH NEED NOT JUST WITH

02:02:18.597 --> 02:02:19.699
THESE TWO THAT.

02:02:19.765 --> 02:02:22.368
THAT CONTRIBUTE BUT THESE OTHER

02:02:22.435 --> 02:02:24.403
PROVIDERS THAT ALSO SEE THE NEED --

02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:26.038
AND SO THAT'S KIND OF WHERE I'M

02:02:26.105 --> 02:02:26.972
STRUGGLING BECAUSE I KNOW THAT

02:02:27.039 --> 02:02:28.808
THE KIDDING FOUNDATION IS TRYING

02:02:28.874 --> 02:02:30.476
TO DO GOOD WORK AND BECAUSE OF

02:02:30.543 --> 02:02:31.610
THESE OTHER PEOPLE THAT WERE

02:02:31.677 --> 02:02:33.579
TRYING TO TARGET I FEEL LIKE

02:02:33.646 --> 02:02:34.547
THEY'RE TAKING THE HEAD.

02:02:34.613 --> 02:02:36.582
I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT

02:02:36.649 --> 02:02:38.617
ABOUT -- I HEARD THE GENTLEMAN

02:02:38.684 --> 02:02:39.418
I'M SORRY I DON'T KNOW YOUR NAME

02:02:39.485 --> 02:02:42.021
YOU TALKED ABOUT THE AG.

02:02:42.088 --> 02:02:43.422
AND YOU LITERALLY READ THE THE

02:02:43.489 --> 02:02:45.858
CONVERSATION BETWEEN BOTH OF YOU.

02:02:45.925 --> 02:02:47.693
AND I KEEP HEARING -- TO YOU

02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:49.495
WILL LEAVE CALIFORNIA IF THAT'S

02:02:49.562 --> 02:02:53.799
THE CASE AND I KNOW THAT THERE

02:02:53.866 --> 02:02:55.334
IS DISAGREEMENT.

02:02:55.401 --> 02:02:56.102
BUT I'M ALSO A LITTLE BUT YOU

02:02:56.168 --> 02:02:57.103
KNOW I WAS READING -- RIGHT NOW

02:02:57.169 --> 02:02:58.771
IS GOING OVER -- WHAT THE CHAIR

02:02:58.838 --> 02:03:00.039
READ WHICH WAS THE CONCLUSION TO

02:03:00.106 --> 02:03:00.473
OUR?

02:03:00.539 --> 02:03:02.174
COUNCIL AND EVEN THOUGH THEY SAY

02:03:02.241 --> 02:03:03.209
THEY DON'T BELIEVE THEY WILL

02:03:03.275 --> 02:03:05.311
LEAVE THEY CONCLUDED BY SAYING

02:03:05.377 --> 02:03:07.313
HOWEVER IT'S THIS WOULD BE A

02:03:07.379 --> 02:03:10.049
FACTUAL DETERMINATION MADE BY

02:03:10.116 --> 02:03:10.616
THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR

02:03:10.683 --> 02:03:11.250
GENERAL.

02:03:11.317 --> 02:03:13.052
AND COULD INVOLVE CONSIDERATION

02:03:13.119 --> 02:03:14.553
OF FACTS THAT ARE NOT AVAILABLE

02:03:14.620 --> 02:03:16.989
TO US RIGHT NOW SO THERE IS AN

02:03:17.056 --> 02:03:18.891
UNKNOWN THEY HAVE NOT

02:03:18.958 --> 02:03:20.059
DEFINITIVELY SAD.

02:03:20.126 --> 02:03:22.294
THAT.

02:03:22.361 --> 02:03:23.229
THEY WON'T LEAVE OR OR WILL

02:03:23.295 --> 02:03:25.331
LEAVE THIS IS NOT A CERTAINTY

02:03:25.397 --> 02:03:26.265
FOR ME.

02:03:26.332 --> 02:03:27.533
AND THE REASON I SAY THAT

02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:29.335
BECAUSE I SPEND THE LAST TWO

02:03:29.401 --> 02:03:30.870
MONTHS MEETING WITH SOME OF THE

02:03:30.936 --> 02:03:33.172
PATIENTS IN MY DISTRICT WHICH IS.

02:03:33.239 --> 02:03:34.673
THERE'S QUITE A BIT.

02:03:34.740 --> 02:03:36.776
AND I WANTED TO PUT A FACE TO TO

02:03:36.842 --> 02:03:37.843
THE DISCUSSION BECAUSE I KNOW

02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:39.211
SOMETIMES WE GET INTO THE POLICY

02:03:39.278 --> 02:03:40.913
AREA BUT WE FORGET THAT THERE'S

02:03:40.980 --> 02:03:42.648
PEOPLE BEHIND THIS.

02:03:42.715 --> 02:03:44.350
I KNOW IT'S THIRTY THIRTY SEVEN

02:03:44.416 --> 02:03:44.984
HUNDRED FROM WHAT I HEARD RIGHT

02:03:45.050 --> 02:03:47.153
NOW BUT I DO HAVE AROUND SIXTY

02:03:47.219 --> 02:03:48.187
SIX AND I WAS ABLE TO MEET WITH

02:03:48.254 --> 02:03:49.455
A GROUP OF PEOPLE TRYING TO

02:03:49.522 --> 02:03:51.657
UNDERSTAND.

02:03:51.724 --> 02:03:53.259
WHAT THEIR CIRCUMSTANCE WELL AS?

02:03:53.325 --> 02:03:54.794
AND AND THEY DON'T NECESSARILY

02:03:54.860 --> 02:03:55.761
FIT THE PROFILE THAT WE'RE

02:03:55.828 --> 02:03:58.197
TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW THESE ARE

02:03:58.264 --> 02:03:59.465
NOT PEOPLE THEY WERE.

02:03:59.532 --> 02:04:01.066
AND ONE CIRCUMSTANCE AND SOMEONE

02:04:01.133 --> 02:04:03.135
TRY TO DRAG HIM INTO ANOTHER AYE

02:04:03.202 --> 02:04:03.702
THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT WERE

02:04:03.769 --> 02:04:07.373
BENEFITING -- FROM THIS -- EXTRA

02:04:07.439 --> 02:04:09.542
HELP ONE OF THEM SAID THAT EVERY.

02:04:09.608 --> 02:04:11.343
SHE'S BEEN ON DIALYSIS FOR EIGHT

02:04:11.410 --> 02:04:12.511
YEARS AND EVERY I THINK THREE

02:04:12.578 --> 02:04:14.280
MONTHS IT'S LIKE ANOTHER SEVEN

02:04:14.346 --> 02:04:15.681
HUNDRED OR SO OUT OF POCKET THAT

02:04:15.748 --> 02:04:18.417
SHE CAN'T AFFORD -- SHE IS -- A

02:04:18.484 --> 02:04:20.386
SPECIALIST WITH THE LAPD IN

02:04:20.452 --> 02:04:22.588
DOWNTOWN LA AND SHE HAS A GOOD

02:04:22.655 --> 02:04:25.424
JOB A GOOD SITUATION BUT WHEN%

02:04:25.491 --> 02:04:27.593
SHE NEEDED TO HAVE DIALYSIS SHE

02:04:27.660 --> 02:04:29.829
STARTED FALLING ON HARD TIMES

02:04:29.895 --> 02:04:30.729
AND THIS WAS.

02:04:30.796 --> 02:04:32.731
WHAT SAVED -- AND SO I RIGHT NOW

02:04:32.798 --> 02:04:34.166
I'M CONCERNED THAT THERE IS NOT

02:04:34.233 --> 02:04:36.802
A PLAN . FOR THE THIRTY SEVEN

02:04:36.869 --> 02:04:39.705
HUNDRED PATIENTS SO THAT'S WHERE

02:04:39.772 --> 02:04:41.240
MY FOCUS IS.

02:04:41.307 --> 02:04:42.107
WHAT I DO WITH THOSE THREE SEVEN

02:04:42.174 --> 02:04:43.309
WELL I'M NOT NECESSARY TALK

02:04:43.375 --> 02:04:44.243
ABOUT THEIR SEVEN THIRTY SEVEN

02:04:44.310 --> 02:04:45.344
IT'S THE GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT I

02:04:45.411 --> 02:04:47.046
MET IN MY DISTRICT -- THAT

02:04:47.112 --> 02:04:48.247
REALLY TRULY DEPEND ON THE

02:04:48.314 --> 02:04:50.316
SERVICE LIKE I'M CONCERNED ABOUT

02:04:50.382 --> 02:04:51.884
THEIR LAPSED AND AND COVERAGE IN

02:04:51.951 --> 02:04:53.219

THIS OUT I'M.

02:04:54.053 --> 02:04:56.088
NOT A PATIENT BUT I CAN ONLY

02:04:56.155 --> 02:04:56.689
IMAGINE IT'S REALLY TAX SCENE

02:04:56.755 --> 02:04:58.691
AND MENTALLY EXHAUSTING A

02:04:58.757 --> 02:05:00.226
PERHAPS VERY EMOTIONAL SO I

02:05:00.292 --> 02:05:01.627
CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT THAT

02:05:01.694 --> 02:05:02.928
TRANSITION PERIOD.

02:05:02.995 --> 02:05:04.897
LOOKS LIKE BUT I I WILL ALSO

AND AND I'M NOT SURE YOU CAN

02:05:13.005 --> 02:05:14.373
TELL ME HOW MANY OR WHAT THE

02:05:14.440 --> 02:05:15.774
AGES ARE BUT YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE

02:05:15.841 --> 02:05:17.176
GOING TO BE SOME PEOPLE IN

02:05:17.243 --> 02:05:17.776
BETWEEN THEIR THAT MAY NOT BE

02:05:17.843 --> 02:05:19.044
ABLE TO GET.

02:05:19.111 --> 02:05:21.113
HELP ELSEWHERE AND SO I WAS

02:05:21.180 --> 02:05:22.414
STRUGGLING WITH THE UNCERTAINTY

02:05:22.481 --> 02:05:24.884
WITH THE CONCLUSION OF OUR LEGAL

02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:26.418
COUNSEL THAT SAYS THAT.

02:05:26.485 --> 02:05:28.687
THEY COULDN'T DEFINITIVELY SAY

02:05:28.754 --> 02:05:30.756
YES OR NO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE

02:05:30.823 --> 02:05:32.524
THEIR FAX AT THEIR DISPOSAL SO I

02:05:32.591 --> 02:05:33.592
WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT THERE'S

02:05:33.659 --> 02:05:35.895
A PLAN BEFORE THE THIRTY SEVEN

02:05:35.961 --> 02:05:38.664
HUNDRED PATIENTS.

02:05:38.731 --> 02:05:40.499
AND ASSURANCE THAT.

02:05:40.566 --> 02:05:41.500
THE KIDNEY FOUNDATION WILL LEAVE

02:05:41.567 --> 02:05:42.368
AND I'M NOT SURE I'M HEARING

02:05:42.434 --> 02:05:42.868

02:05:42.935 --> 02:05:43.769
I WILL CONTINUE TO LISTEN TO THE

02:05:43.836 --> 02:05:44.637
DISCUSSION BUT RIGHT NOW I'M

02:05:44.703 --> 02:05:46.205
CONFLICTED BECAUSE I KNOW THAT I

02:05:46.272 --> 02:05:47.873
WANT PATIENTS TO GET CARE AND

02:05:47.940 --> 02:05:49.008

02:05:53.212 --> 02:05:55.581
ADD.

02:05:55.648 --> 02:05:57.149
THE THE THE THE POINT THAT YOU

02:05:57.216 --> 02:05:58.951
MAKE THAT THE PEOPLE THAT YOU

02:05:59.018 --> 02:06:01.453
MET WITH MAY NOT LOOK LIKE SOME

02:06:01.520 --> 02:06:02.655
OF THE FOLKS THAT WERE IMAGINE I

02:06:02.721 --> 02:06:03.389
MINE.

02:06:03.455 --> 02:06:05.157
IS A VERY IMPORTANT POINT IN

02:06:05.224 --> 02:06:07.293
THIS POPULATION WE HAVE PEOPLE

02:06:07.359 --> 02:06:09.628

BROUGHT ABOUT COBRA.

02:06:35.087 --> 02:06:36.522
COBRA IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU

THEIR INSURANCE THEY'RE TRYING

02:06:59.845 --> 02:07:01.613
TO HOLD ON TO WHAT THEY HAVE.

02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:03.349
SO THAT THEY CAN KEEP THEMSELVES

02:07:03.415 --> 02:07:04.817
TO KEEP THEMSELVES WELL AND IT'S

02:07:04.883 --> 02:07:06.685
VERY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND

02:07:06.752 --> 02:07:09.054
THAT THAT DISTINCTION AND WE WE

02:07:09.121 --> 02:07:10.522
ARE HAPPY TO WORK CONTINUE TO

02:07:10.589 --> 02:07:12.324

MISTER WOOD AND ERIC A SOME

02:07:14.193 --> 02:07:15.260
WOMEN WOULD AND AND SENATE

02:07:15.327 --> 02:07:18.263
OPINION TO TRY TO GET.

02:07:18.330 --> 02:07:20.132
TO RESOLVE SOME OF THESE ISSUES

02:07:20.199 --> 02:07:21.800
OF THAT THEY HAVE BROUGHT UP WE

02:07:21.867 --> 02:07:22.868
WE'VE WE'VE OFFERED CERTAIN

02:07:22.935 --> 02:07:25.137
AMENDMENTS TO DEAL WITH THE FACT.

02:07:25.204 --> 02:07:26.772
THAT HOW DO WE PROTECT THOSE

02:07:26.839 --> 02:07:28.474
PEOPLE WHO ARE CONTINUING THE

02:07:28.540 --> 02:07:29.708
COVERAGE THAT THEY'VE HAD ALL

02:07:29.775 --> 02:07:31.543
ALONG THOSE ARE REALLY VERY

02:07:31.610 --> 02:07:33.078
IMPORTANT DISTINCTIONS.

02:07:33.145 --> 02:07:34.246
WELL AND AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE

02:07:34.313 --> 02:07:35.948
IT LIKE I SAID I DON'T HAVE THIS

02:07:36.015 --> 02:07:37.216
DISCUSSION UP HERE NOT.

02:07:37.282 --> 02:07:39.551
KNOW WHO I WAS TALKING ABOUT SO

02:07:39.618 --> 02:07:40.019
WHEN I MET WITH THESE

02:07:40.085 --> 02:07:41.220
INDIVIDUALS.

02:07:41.286 --> 02:07:42.955
I MEAN WELL EDUCATED AS YOU

02:07:43.022 --> 02:07:43.989
STATED THEY WORKED ALL THEIR

02:07:44.056 --> 02:07:45.257
LIVES IN THE YOU KNOW HOW

02:07:45.324 --> 02:07:46.458
PROFESSIONS THAT ARE YOU KNOW

02:07:46.525 --> 02:07:49.962
QUITE -- IMPRESSIVE AND YET YOU

02:07:50.029 --> 02:07:51.663
KNOW WHEN THEY STARTED YOU KNOW

02:07:51.730 --> 02:07:53.399
EIGHT YEARS -- SHE SAID SHE WENT

02:07:53.465 --> 02:07:54.700
TO HER SAVINGS AND THEN -- SHE

02:07:54.767 --> 02:07:56.201
WAS STRUGGLING JUST TO EVEN PAY

02:07:56.268 --> 02:07:57.503
FOR HER AND SHE TOOK OUT LOANS

02:07:57.569 --> 02:07:58.804
AND THEN IT BECAME A CYCLE MY

02:07:58.871 --> 02:08:00.172
POINT IS THAT.

02:08:00.239 --> 02:08:01.840
IT YOU KNOW SHE JUST NEEDED HELP

02:08:01.907 --> 02:08:04.176
AND AS SHE WAS ABLE TO GO TO

02:08:04.243 --> 02:08:05.844
THAT IS THE FOUNDATION AN AND SO

02:08:05.911 --> 02:08:07.012
AGAIN YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT SHE

02:08:07.079 --> 02:08:07.980
DID EVERYTHING.

02:08:08.047 --> 02:08:09.882
CORRECTLY AND THEN SHE WASN'T

02:08:09.948 --> 02:08:12.785
ANTICIPATING THIS ILLNESS -- BUT

02:08:12.851 --> 02:08:13.752
AGAIN I REALLY JUST WANTED TO

02:08:13.819 --> 02:08:14.887
MAKE SURE THAT I KNEW WHAT I WAS

02:08:14.953 --> 02:08:16.522
TALKING ABOUT AND THESE ARE

02:08:16.588 --> 02:08:18.023
PEOPLE MY DISTRICT BY MATT ONE

02:08:18.090 --> 02:08:20.392
ON ONE WHO SHARE THEIR STORIES

02:08:20.459 --> 02:08:22.361
AND AND SO AGAIN I STRUGGLING

02:08:22.428 --> 02:08:23.529
WITH THE FACT THAT I LIKE I SAID

02:08:23.595 --> 02:08:24.196
I YOU KNOW.

02:08:24.263 --> 02:08:25.497
I DON'T WANT TO GET INFORMATION

02:08:25.564 --> 02:08:27.032
TO LEASE BUT YET I FEEL LIKE

02:08:27.099 --> 02:08:28.700
THERE'S AN UNCERTAINTY ABOUT

02:08:28.767 --> 02:08:30.335
WHETHER IT WILL LEAVE OR NOT AND

02:08:30.402 --> 02:08:32.371
AND SO THAT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME

02:08:32.438 --> 02:08:33.572
WHEN I DON'T HAVE LIKE A CERTAIN

02:08:33.639 --> 02:08:33.972
ANSWER.

02:08:34.039 --> 02:08:35.207
THAT'S WHY I WAS ASKING IF THERE

02:08:35.274 --> 02:08:36.675
WAS SOME KIND OF PROTECTIONS

02:08:36.742 --> 02:08:37.509
THAT WE CAN.

02:08:37.576 --> 02:08:39.912
PUT IN PLACE SO THERE IS NO

02:08:39.978 --> 02:08:41.413
STEERING AS THEY CALLED IT AND

02:08:41.480 --> 02:08:43.148
BUT I DID HEAR DOCTOR POUND SAY

02:08:43.215 --> 02:08:44.583
THAT YOU DON'T.

02:08:44.650 --> 02:08:45.651
PARTICIPATE IN THAT THAT THERE'S

02:08:45.717 --> 02:08:47.386
SAFEGUARDS AGAINST THAT AND

02:08:47.453 --> 02:08:48.887
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST SO.

02:08:48.954 --> 02:08:50.189

02:13:23.562 --> 02:13:25.664
OPINION IF THINGS HAVE CHANGED

02:13:25.731 --> 02:13:27.199
IN THE LAST TWENTY TWO YEARS.

02:13:27.265 --> 02:13:29.334
THE THE WAY THE PROCESS WORKS IS

02:13:29.401 --> 02:13:35.707
THAT NUMBER -- ONE THE WE WOULD

02:13:35.774 --> 02:13:37.309

I WITH ALL DUE RESPECT MISTER

02:13:49.087 --> 02:13:51.523

LEDGE COUNCIL SAID SOMETHING

02:13:53.024 --> 02:13:54.960
THAT THEY DIDN'T SAY.

02:13:55.026 --> 02:13:57.362
THAT IS NOT WHAT WE'RE IMPLYING --

02:13:57.429 --> 02:13:59.831
BE AND AND I GREW TO THAT

02:13:59.898 --> 02:14:01.199
CONCLUSION IS WHAT THEY SAID.

02:14:01.266 --> 02:14:02.267
WHAT WE ARE AT YOUR OWN OPINION

02:14:02.334 --> 02:14:03.635

WHAT ELSE MIGHT HAPPEN?

02:14:18.283 --> 02:14:19.785
WHAT WE'RE REFERRING TO IN THE

02:14:19.851 --> 02:14:22.487
LEDGE COUNCIL LETTER IS THAT

02:14:22.554 --> 02:14:24.790
THEY SAID THIS ARRANGEMENT GOALS

02:14:24.856 --> 02:14:28.560
BEYOND INTO NANI GOALS BEYOND

02:14:28.627 --> 02:14:30.295
WHAT YOU ARE APPROVED?

02:14:30.362 --> 02:14:32.230
IT GOES BEYOND THAT AND THEN

02:14:32.297 --> 02:14:35.200
THEY OPINED ON HOW OLD THE I. G.

02:14:35.267 --> 02:14:37.436
MIGHT RE INTERPRET WERE THEY TO

02:14:37.502 --> 02:14:39.271
REVIEW THE WHOLE THING ALL

02:14:39.337 --> 02:14:41.206
TOGETHER AGAIN AND SAID THAT

02:14:41.273 --> 02:14:43.275
THEY BELIEVE THAT THE IG WITH

02:14:43.341 --> 02:14:44.576
THAT APPROVE THAT.

02:14:44.643 --> 02:14:46.511
AND WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT AS

02:14:46.578 --> 02:14:49.614
A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION.

02:14:49.681 --> 02:14:51.750
WE CANNOT STEP OUT ON A LIMB AND

02:14:51.817 --> 02:14:53.084
SAY WELL WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE

02:14:53.151 --> 02:14:54.619
THE SAFETY OF KNOWING WHAT WE'RE

02:14:54.686 --> 02:14:56.688
DOING IS FOLLOWING THE RULES AND

02:14:56.755 --> 02:14:58.457
INSTEAD WE'RE GOING TO GO OUT ON

AND TO ME IT JUST SEEMS LOGICAL

02:15:13.939 --> 02:15:15.574
IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY SAYING THAT

02:15:15.640 --> 02:15:17.476
YOU WOULD LEAVE CALIFORNIA BASED

02:15:17.542 --> 02:15:18.877

WE THINK IT'S IN THE BEST

02:15:48.139 --> 02:15:50.342
INTEREST OF THE SEVENTY FIVE

02:15:50.408 --> 02:15:51.142
THOUSAND PATIENTS THAT WE ASSIST

02:15:53.378 --> 02:15:54.613
CALIFORNIA DECISIONS IS A

02:15:54.679 --> 02:15:55.981
CALIFORNIA BILL.

02:15:56.047 --> 02:15:57.816
SO JUST IT IT IT'S FINE I OUSTED

02:15:57.883 --> 02:15:59.351
YOU DON'T HAVE AN NSWER --

02:15:59.417 --> 02:16:02.287
JONES DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO

02:16:02.354 --> 02:16:03.054
ADD TO THAT.

02:16:03.121 --> 02:16:04.155
I'D LIKE TO TAKE A STEP BACK

02:16:04.222 --> 02:16:05.657
JUST A MOMENT AND I I APPRECIATE

02:16:05.724 --> 02:16:07.425
THIS DISCUSSION BECAUSE THE A

02:16:07.492 --> 02:16:08.793
CALF DID.

02:16:08.860 --> 02:16:11.696
IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX NINETEEN

02:16:11.763 --> 02:16:14.933
NINETY SEVEN ALONG WITH.

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:15.433
SEVEN AS SEVEN DIALYSIS

02:16:15.500 --> 02:16:17.235
COMPANIES.

02:16:17.302 --> 02:16:18.703
ARMORS SIX BILLION ABOUT AN ITEM

02:16:18.770 --> 02:16:20.305
THAT BUT A UNNAMED DIALYSIS

02:16:20.372 --> 02:16:22.541
COMPANIES SEEK AN OPINION FROM

02:16:22.607 --> 02:16:23.241
THE IG.

02:16:23.308 --> 02:16:25.977
SO IT WAS NOT THE O. I. G..

02:16:26.044 --> 02:16:27.746
MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS OPINION

02:16:27.812 --> 02:16:29.614
IN THE ABSENCE OF A REQUEST IT

02:16:29.681 --> 02:16:31.483
WAS THE A CALF AND DIALYSIS

02:16:31.550 --> 02:16:32.617
PROVIDERS.

02:16:32.684 --> 02:16:37.188
pIG APPROVED WAS AN ARRANGEMENT

02:16:37.255 --> 02:16:39.958
THAT HAD SUBSTANTIAL GUARD RAILS

02:16:40.025 --> 02:16:41.593
SOME OF THOSE GUARD RAILS WERE

02:16:41.660 --> 02:16:44.129
THAT THE COMPANIES WOULD NOT.

02:16:44.195 --> 02:16:45.931
ADVERTISE PUBLICLY.

02:16:45.997 --> 02:16:47.198
THE HIT PROGRAM THE A CAPS

02:16:47.265 --> 02:16:49.100
PREMIUM ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.

02:16:49.167 --> 02:16:50.569
THAT THEY WOULD NOT DISCLOSE

02:16:50.635 --> 02:16:52.003
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO

02:16:52.070 --> 02:16:54.506
PATIENTS THAT THE THAT THE

02:16:54.573 --> 02:16:57.576
PROVIDER CONTRIBUTED -- THOSE

02:16:57.642 --> 02:16:59.878
REALLY ARE SOME OF THE THE

02:16:59.945 --> 02:17:02.347
ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THEIR OTHER.

02:17:02.414 --> 02:17:04.115
GUARD RAILS IN PLACE BUT THOSE

02:17:04.182 --> 02:17:05.050
ARE ARE PRETTY CRAPPY ONES

02:17:05.116 --> 02:17:05.350
[inaudible]

02:17:05.417 --> 02:17:08.720
AND THOSE THE SITUATIONS HAVE

02:17:08.787 --> 02:17:11.423
CHANGED OVER THE YEARS -- BUT

02:17:11.489 --> 02:17:12.991
THAT'S REALLY A LOT OF WHERE THE

02:17:13.058 --> 02:17:15.427
A CALF IS HINGING THEIR CONCERN

02:17:15.493 --> 02:17:16.661
AND CLAIMING THAT THEY WOULD

02:17:16.728 --> 02:17:18.830
NEED TO LEAVE CALIFORNIA -- WITH

02:17:18.897 --> 02:17:20.165
REGARD TO THE DISCLOSURE TO

02:17:20.231 --> 02:17:22.233
PATIENTS.

02:17:22.300 --> 02:17:23.535
WE TOOK VERY SERIOUSLY THE A

02:17:23.602 --> 02:17:25.003
CAPS CONCERNED THAT THE BILL

02:17:25.070 --> 02:17:27.305
COULD THROUGH AS THE LEGISLATURE

02:17:27.372 --> 02:17:28.106
CALLED IN IT AT THE LEDGE

02:17:28.173 --> 02:17:29.708
COUNCIL CALLD AN ATTENUATED

02:17:29.774 --> 02:17:30.875

02:17:30.942 --> 02:17:33.311
THAT A PATIENT COULD BECOME

02:17:33.378 --> 02:17:37.215
AWARE THAT THEIR CLINIC.

02:17:37.282 --> 02:17:39.017
WE TOOK THAT VERY SERIOUSLY AND

WE TOOK AMENDMENTS -- DOCTOR

02:17:45.023 --> 02:17:47.092
WHAT AMENDED THE BILL TO PREVENT

02:17:47.158 --> 02:17:50.095
IN ANY WAY THE DISCLOSURE OF A

CLINICS PROVIDER STATUS.

02:17:51.830 --> 02:17:53.231
AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE IS THAT

02:17:53.298 --> 02:17:55.533
FOR EVERY OTHER TYPE OF PROVIDER

02:17:55.600 --> 02:17:57.235
IN THE STATE.

02:17:57.302 --> 02:17:58.603
THEY WOULD BE DEEMED FINANCIALLY

02:17:58.670 --> 02:18:00.238
INTERESTED.

02:18:00.305 --> 02:18:01.506
IF THEY ARE EITHER PAYING A

PATIENTS PREMIUMS.

02:18:03.475 --> 02:18:05.577
OR IF THEY ARE ARE CONTRIBUTING

02:18:05.644 --> 02:18:06.911
TO AN ORGANIZATION THAT IS

02:18:06.978 --> 02:18:07.712
CONSIDERED FINANCIALLY

02:18:07.779 --> 02:18:08.513
INTERESTED.

02:18:08.580 --> 02:18:10.181
WE CREATED A NEW ENTIRELY NEW

02:18:10.248 --> 02:18:12.717
CATEGORY.

02:18:12.784 --> 02:18:13.718
OF FINANCIALLY INTERESTED ENTITY

02:18:13.785 --> 02:18:15.120
THAT THE THAT ENCOMPASSES

02:18:15.186 --> 02:18:16.721
DIALYSIS CLINICS.

02:18:16.788 --> 02:18:18.023
AND THE LEGISLATION IS CURRENTLY

02:18:18.089 --> 02:18:20.759
AT SECTION -- F. TO SEE WITH THE

02:18:20.825 --> 02:18:22.827
AMENDMENTS TO THE MOVE TO G. TO

02:18:22.894 --> 02:18:25.163
SEE IF YOU WANT TO READ IT --

02:18:25.230 --> 02:18:27.132
SAYS THAT FOR A DIALYSIS CLINIC

02:18:27.198 --> 02:18:28.767
TO BE CONSIDERED FINANCIALLY

02:18:28.833 --> 02:18:30.168
INTERESTED.

02:18:30.235 --> 02:18:32.971
THEY EITHER HAVE AT LEAST A 10%

02:18:33.038 --> 02:18:34.873
MARKET SHARE IN CALIFORNIA OR

02:18:34.939 --> 02:18:35.940
CONSIDERED A LARGE DIALYSIS

02:18:36.007 --> 02:18:37.275
ORGANIZATION BY THE FEDERAL

02:18:37.342 --> 02:18:38.410
GOVERNMENT WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE

02:18:38.476 --> 02:18:39.511
MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED CLINICS

02:18:39.577 --> 02:18:40.612
NATIONALLY.

02:18:40.679 --> 02:18:42.580
THAT MEANS THE PROVIDER STATUS

02:18:42.647 --> 02:18:44.115
THE PROVIDER -- CONTRIBUTE

02:18:44.182 --> 02:18:45.784
CONTRIBUTE CONTRIBUTOR STATUS

02:18:45.850 --> 02:18:49.387
THE A CALF NOW HAS NOTHING TO DO.

02:18:49.454 --> 02:18:50.922
WITH WHETHER A CLINIC IS

02:18:50.989 --> 02:18:52.057
CONSIDERED FINANCIALLY

02:18:52.123 --> 02:18:53.591
INTERESTED UNDER THE BILL.

02:18:53.658 --> 02:18:56.961
AND THAT IS VERY CLEAR -- WHAT

02:18:57.028 --> 02:18:59.397
THAT MEANS IS THAT THERE IS NOW

02:18:59.464 --> 02:19:01.032
ZERO CHANCE BUT THE A CALF WOULD

02:19:01.099 --> 02:19:02.434
BE DISCLOSING DIRECTLY OR

02:19:02.500 --> 02:19:03.902
INDIRECTLY TO A PATIENT?

02:19:03.968 --> 02:19:06.271
THAT THE CLINIC IS A CONTRIBUTOR

02:19:06.337 --> 02:19:07.472
THE A CALF WOULD BE REQUIRED TO

02:19:07.539 --> 02:19:08.506
FOLLOW THE DISCLOSURE

02:19:08.573 --> 02:19:09.674
REQUIREMENTS TO THE HEALTH

02:19:09.741 --> 02:19:12.610
INSURANCE PLANS FOR ALL PATIENTS

02:19:12.677 --> 02:19:13.211
FOR WHOM.

02:19:13.278 --> 02:19:15.313
IT RIGHTS GRANTS THAT WOULD MEAN

02:19:15.380 --> 02:19:17.982
CONTRIBUTOR CLINICS AND NON

02:19:18.049 --> 02:19:20.151
CONTRIBUTOR CLINICS ALIKE --

02:19:20.218 --> 02:19:22.220
WE'VE MADE THIS UNIFORM EVEN

02:19:22.287 --> 02:19:23.555
THOUGH THE BILL NO LONGER WOULD

02:19:23.621 --> 02:19:26.091
APPLY TO SOME CLINICS WHO ARE

02:19:26.157 --> 02:19:27.559
CONTRIBUTORS.

02:19:27.625 --> 02:19:29.260
BECAUSE THOSE CLINICS BELONG TO

02:19:29.327 --> 02:19:31.296
SMALLER SYSTEMS ARE INDEPENDENT

02:19:31.362 --> 02:19:32.931
CYST OR INDEPENDENT CLINICS.

02:19:32.997 --> 02:19:35.200
AND DO NOT HAVE THE MARKET SHARE

02:19:35.266 --> 02:19:37.235
TO BE DEMANDING THE INCREDIBLY

02:19:37.302 --> 02:19:39.637
EXORBITANT COMMERCIAL RATES --

02:19:39.704 --> 02:19:41.639
SO WE HAVE WE TOOK THE A CHAOS

02:19:41.706 --> 02:19:43.308
CONCERN.

02:19:43.375 --> 02:19:45.477
BROKE THAT LINKAGE WHICH MEANS

02:19:45.543 --> 02:19:46.578
THAT WE NOW FEEL THAT IT IS

02:19:46.644 --> 02:19:49.647
DISINGENUOUS BE CLAIMING THAT.

02:19:49.714 --> 02:19:50.648
THAT PART OF THE O. I. G. MEMO

02:19:50.715 --> 02:19:52.350
IS.

02:19:52.417 --> 02:19:54.519
EVEN AT RISK OF BEING VIOLATED

02:19:54.586 --> 02:19:56.921
BEFORE THEY GO BACK TO A NEW A

02:19:56.988 --> 02:19:59.557
NEW -- IG OPINION HOWEVER.

02:19:59.624 --> 02:20:00.792
THE DIALYSIS COMPANIES DO

02:20:00.859 --> 02:20:05.096
ROUTINELY VIOLATE THE O. I. G.'S.

02:20:05.163 --> 02:20:08.032

02:20:20.745 --> 02:20:22.680
PATIENTS SEEKING TO A PAYMENT

02:20:22.747 --> 02:20:24.082

02:20:24.149 --> 02:20:27.418
THAT IS A PLANE LETTER VIOLATION.

02:20:27.485 --> 02:20:29.320
OF THE IG OPINION.

02:20:29.387 --> 02:20:32.290

THERE'S A LOT OF DEBATE GOING

02:22:33.945 --> 02:22:35.113
BACK AND FORTH.

02:22:35.179 --> 02:22:37.982
AND WE WON'T KNOW.

02:22:38.049 --> 02:22:39.784
WHO IS RIGHT AND WHO IS WRONG

02:22:39.851 --> 02:22:44.289
UNTIL AFTER THE FACT AND SO --

02:22:44.355 --> 02:22:45.657
BUT I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU

02:22:45.723 --> 02:22:47.725
MY OPPOSITION TO TO TO THE BILL

02:22:47.792 --> 02:22:50.061
TODAY AND BECAUSE IT'S A DEEPLY

02:22:50.128 --> 02:22:52.664
PERSONAL ONE TO ME -- YOU KNOW

02:22:52.730 --> 02:22:54.032
ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO MY

02:22:54.098 --> 02:22:55.466
GRANDMOTHER.

02:22:55.533 --> 02:22:57.435
PASSED AWAY SHE HAD BEEN ON

02:22:57.502 --> 02:22:59.304
DIALYSIS FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS.

02:22:59.370 --> 02:23:02.240
AND WHEN WE FIRST WE KNEW THAT

02:23:02.307 --> 02:23:04.108
SHE HAD CHALLENGES WITH DIABETES

02:23:04.175 --> 02:23:07.645
AND AND WHATNOT -- BUT WHEN WE

02:23:07.712 --> 02:23:09.447
LEARNED THAT SHE HAD.

02:23:09.514 --> 02:23:11.149
TO YOU KNOW TAKE A DO DIALYSIS

02:23:11.215 --> 02:23:17.155

02:23:17.221 --> 02:23:17.689
YOU KNOW HOW BIG ARE YOUR

02:23:17.755 --> 02:23:20.425
PROFITS.

02:23:20.491 --> 02:23:22.160
WE WERE WORRIED AND CONCERNED

02:23:22.226 --> 02:23:23.428
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT SHE WAS

02:23:23.494 --> 02:23:24.362
GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET THE

02:23:24.429 --> 02:23:25.396
TREATMENT THAT SHE NEEDED TO

02:23:25.463 --> 02:23:27.465
SURVIVE.

02:23:27.532 --> 02:23:30.468
BECAUSE DIALYSIS TREATMENT AS A

02:23:30.535 --> 02:23:32.070
MATTER OF LIFE OR DEATH.

02:23:32.136 --> 02:23:34.272
IT IS NOT A JOKE IT IS NOT

02:23:34.339 --> 02:23:35.139
SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE PLAYED

02:23:35.206 --> 02:23:36.908
WITH IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS

02:23:36.975 --> 02:23:45.583
VERY SERIOUS -- EVEN MORE SO TO

02:23:45.650 --> 02:23:48.786
ME BECAUSE I HAVE THREE COUSINS

02:23:48.853 --> 02:23:54.058
ON DIALYSIS RIGHT NOW

02:23:54.125 --> 02:23:57.362

RELATIVE ON MY FATHER'S SIDE HAS

02:23:59.230 --> 02:24:00.765
PASSED AWAY BECAUSE OF KIDNEY

02:24:00.832 --> 02:24:03.501
FAILURE.

02:24:03.568 --> 02:24:05.503
ALL HAVE HAD TO YOU KNOW GO

02:24:05.570 --> 02:24:08.906
THROUGH DIALYSIS TREATMENT.

02:24:08.973 --> 02:24:11.476
SO WE CAN SIT HERE AND DEBATE

02:24:11.542 --> 02:24:14.112
ALL DAY WHO IS RIGHT WHO IS

02:24:14.178 --> 02:24:17.982
WRONG WHO IS LINE WAS NOT LINE.

02:24:18.049 --> 02:24:18.916
I DON'T KNOW I DON'T HAVE THE

02:24:18.983 --> 02:24:20.251
ANSWER OF WHOSE LINE WHO'S NOT

02:24:20.318 --> 02:24:21.619
WHO'S RIGHT WHO'S WRONG I DON'T

02:24:21.686 --> 02:24:23.755
HAVE THAT ANSWER ALL I KNOW IS

02:24:23.821 --> 02:24:25.123
THAT.

02:24:25.189 --> 02:24:28.192
MY NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IS THAT.

02:24:28.259 --> 02:24:30.561
THE PEOPLE OF MY DISTRICT AND

02:24:30.628 --> 02:24:31.829
PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE OF

02:24:31.896 --> 02:24:33.131
CALIFORNIA.

02:24:33.197 --> 02:24:34.732
THAT MY RELATIVES MY LOVED ONES

IT'S FATAL YOU'D DIE.

02:24:55.820 --> 02:24:58.289
AND I THINK ANYONE IN THIS ROOM

02:24:58.356 --> 02:24:59.891

OF INFORMATION THAT MIGHT BE

02:26:48.933 --> 02:26:49.700
HELPFUL.

02:26:49.767 --> 02:26:51.802

OKAY THANK YOU -- I GUESS

02:27:16.894 --> 02:27:20.698

MISINFORMATION AS IT YEAH.

02:29:10.574 --> 02:29:11.809

02:29:47.278 --> 02:29:50.481
WILL GO BEYOND ANYTHING ELSE --

02:29:50.548 --> 02:29:51.749

02:29:57.488 --> 02:29:59.023
THAT I WANTED TO ASK -- THERE IS

02:29:59.090 --> 02:30:01.325
A COMMENTS MADE EARLIER ABOUT

02:30:01.392 --> 02:30:02.560

02:30:08.366 --> 02:30:10.334
IT DOES NOT.

02:30:10.401 --> 02:30:11.836
SO YOU WOULD BE JEOPARDIZING IF

02:30:11.902 --> 02:30:14.105
IT WAS ADVERSELY AFFECTED

02:30:14.171 --> 02:30:14.705

OKAY AND THEN THE OTHER THING IS

02:30:17.041 --> 02:30:18.542
THAT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING BE

02:30:21.512 --> 02:30:22.446
FOURTEEN OPINION -- WHICH IS

02:30:22.513 --> 02:30:23.881
JUST FIVE YEARS OLD THAT

02:30:23.948 --> 02:30:27.318

APPRECIATE THOSE VERY IMPORTANT

02:30:40.931 --> 02:30:41.332

THESE PATIENTS GET THE CARE THEY

02:37:42.886 --> 02:37:43.487
NEED.

02:37:43.554 --> 02:37:44.922
AND THAT'S WHY SHE WHY BY THE

02:37:44.988 --> 02:37:46.456
WAY CONGRESS DECIDE INCLUDE AS

02:37:46.523 --> 02:37:47.691
PART OF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM IN

THE SEVENTIES I MEAN IT'S KIND

02:37:49.393 --> 02:37:50.127
OF A UNIQUE.

PIECE STATE ENTERED AT OKAY --

02:37:52.796 --> 02:37:54.865
WE ALSO HAVE TO BE SURE THAT THE

02:37:54.932 --> 02:37:57.167
WAY WE STRUCTURE THIS.

02:37:57.234 --> 02:38:01.038
ISN'T IN A WAY THAT IS -- THAT

02:38:01.104 --> 02:38:02.372
THERE'S EITHER REALITY MOST

02:38:02.439 --> 02:38:03.507
IMPORTANTLY BY EVEN THE

02:38:03.574 --> 02:38:04.708
PERCEPTION.

02:38:04.775 --> 02:38:06.210
THAT.

02:38:06.276 --> 02:38:08.412
THESE PATIENTS ARE NOW AN

02:38:08.478 --> 02:38:13.383
OPPORTUNITY. TO THEN MAKE --

02:38:13.450 --> 02:38:14.918
YEAH TREMENDOUS FINANCIAL GAIN

02:38:14.985 --> 02:38:17.321
BECAUSE REALLY WE ARE WE ARE WE

02:38:17.387 --> 02:38:18.488
NEED TO STEP UP TO FIGURE THAT

02:38:18.555 --> 02:38:20.490
OUT RIGHT SO YOU KNOW WE THINK

02:38:20.557 --> 02:38:22.259
ABOUT LIKE I'M TAL OF FOR YARDS

02:38:22.326 --> 02:38:23.894
RIGHT HOSPITAL'S BASICALLY HAVE

02:38:23.961 --> 02:38:25.329
TO SWALLOW THE CLASS.

02:38:25.395 --> 02:38:27.130
AND SOMETIMES YOU DO HEAR PEOPLE

02:38:27.197 --> 02:38:28.232
SAY WELL YOU KNOW WHAT.

02:38:28.298 --> 02:38:29.600
WHY SHOULD I PAY FOR IT I'VE

02:38:29.666 --> 02:38:31.301
HEARD THAT STATEMENT MADE BEFORE

02:38:31.368 --> 02:38:32.669
BECAUSE AFTER ALL YOU HAVE TO

02:38:32.736 --> 02:38:33.804
TAKE CARE OF THEM?

02:38:33.871 --> 02:38:34.705
THE HOSPITAL THEY SHOULD TO

02:38:34.771 --> 02:38:36.206
SWALLOW THE COST THE EARTH

02:38:36.273 --> 02:38:37.708
ETCETERA BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT

02:38:37.774 --> 02:38:38.642
YOU GONNA DO A YOUNG ABANDONED

02:38:38.709 --> 02:38:40.110
THEM AND LIKE NO WE DON'T WANT

02:38:40.177 --> 02:38:41.478
ABANDONED BUT IT TAKES MONEY TO

02:38:41.545 --> 02:38:41.678
RUN.

02:38:41.745 --> 02:38:42.980
THE E. ARE RIGHT AND SO I

02:38:43.046 --> 02:38:44.114
UNDERSTAND IT TAKES MONEY TO RUN

02:38:44.181 --> 02:38:45.682
THE DIALYSIS CENTERS BUT THE

02:38:45.749 --> 02:38:46.717
SAME TIME.

02:38:46.783 --> 02:38:47.851
WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT A

02:38:47.918 --> 02:38:49.853
MENTION BEFORE AND I DISCUSSIONS

02:38:49.920 --> 02:38:52.356
IS THAT -- WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE

02:38:52.422 --> 02:38:53.857
ALSO A SITUATION WE'RE

02:38:53.924 --> 02:38:56.894
RECREATING -- THAT -- THAT

02:38:56.960 --> 02:39:01.899
BASICALLY SAYS -- WHERE

02:39:01.965 --> 02:39:02.733
ESSENTIALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS

02:39:02.799 --> 02:39:04.134
BECAUSE THEY'RE SO GOOD SO SUCH

02:39:04.201 --> 02:39:05.602
A NECESSITY TAKE CARE OF THEM?

02:39:05.669 --> 02:39:07.304
THESE PATIENTS THAT SOMEONE SAYS

02:39:07.371 --> 02:39:09.339
WELL THAT'S GREAT AND SO WHAT

02:39:09.406 --> 02:39:12.843
HAPPENS IS THAT I CAN -- HAVE A

02:39:12.910 --> 02:39:14.411
CREW DEL WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF

02:39:14.478 --> 02:39:15.746
THEM THEY'RE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T

02:39:15.812 --> 02:39:17.047
AFFORD.

02:39:17.114 --> 02:39:18.448
TO WE HAVE A FOUNDATION WE'RE

02:39:18.515 --> 02:39:19.750
GONNA CHANNEL SOME MONEY THERE

02:39:19.816 --> 02:39:21.785
AND THAT THEN WILL HAVE ALLOW US

02:39:21.852 --> 02:39:22.286
TO MAKE.

02:39:22.352 --> 02:39:24.855
YOU KNOW FRANKLY MORE MONEY OFF

02:39:24.922 --> 02:39:25.756
OF THAT THAT WE WANT TO BE SURE

02:39:25.822 --> 02:39:27.291
THE COSTS ARE COVERED THAT'S BY

02:39:27.357 --> 02:39:30.527
THE WAY WHY I INSISTED AND AND

02:39:30.594 --> 02:39:32.229
I'M APPRECIATE TO SUMMER WOULD

02:39:32.296 --> 02:39:33.897
ADDING TO HIS BILL -- A

02:39:33.964 --> 02:39:35.165
MECHANISM TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT

02:39:35.232 --> 02:39:36.733
IF THE MEDICARE RATES WHICH BY

02:39:36.800 --> 02:39:38.669
THE WAY IS ESTABLISHED BASED ON

02:39:38.735 --> 02:39:40.437
COST REPORTS AND SO FORTH -- YOU

02:39:40.504 --> 02:39:42.239
KNOW I I HAVE SOME SKEPTICISM

02:39:42.306 --> 02:39:44.408
ABOUT MEDICARE AND THAT'S WHY I

02:39:44.474 --> 02:39:45.876
WANTED TO HAVE THIS AMENDMENT.

02:39:45.943 --> 02:39:47.010
I HAD YOU KNOW SOME SKETCHES

02:39:47.077 --> 02:39:49.780
ABOUT USING THAT AS A BENCHMARK --

02:39:49.846 --> 02:39:51.114
SO FORTH I'M NOT SURE IT'S A

02:39:51.181 --> 02:39:51.982
GOOD ONE BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE

02:39:52.049 --> 02:39:53.617
HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS WE TRY TO

02:39:53.684 --> 02:39:54.918
WORK SOMETHING ELSE OUT.

02:39:54.985 --> 02:39:55.786
WE LAND WE STILL ENDED UP

02:39:55.852 --> 02:39:57.087
PLANNING THERE BUT TO HAVE THIS

02:39:57.154 --> 02:39:58.922
ARBITRATION MECHANISM BECAUSE

02:39:58.989 --> 02:39:59.890
WHAT I SAID IS THAT THAT THAT

02:39:59.957 --> 02:40:01.291
THAT THE CERTAINLY THE DIALYSIS

02:40:01.358 --> 02:40:02.259
COMPANIES.

02:40:02.326 --> 02:40:03.060
WHO ARE RIGHT THE DIALYSIS

02:40:03.126 --> 02:40:10.033
CENTERS DESERVE TO GET PAID?

02:40:10.100 --> 02:40:10.600
BE IT AMOUNT TO TAKE CARE OF

02:40:10.667 --> 02:40:11.234
THOSE PATIENTS BECAUSE THEY NEED

02:40:11.301 --> 02:40:11.802
THAT CARE WE CAN'T HAVE THEM

02:40:11.868 --> 02:40:13.003
CLOSING UP GOING BANKRUPT NOT

02:40:13.070 --> 02:40:14.504
ABLE TO RUN -- BECAUSE IF THEY

02:40:14.571 --> 02:40:16.039
GO AWAY.

02:40:16.106 --> 02:40:17.975
BILL WE HAVE A BIG PROBLEM RIGHT

02:40:18.041 --> 02:40:19.443
THEY WE NEED THEY NEED TO HAVE

02:40:19.509 --> 02:40:20.744
ACCESS CARE.

02:40:20.811 --> 02:40:22.112
THAT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT

02:40:22.179 --> 02:40:23.313
THAT'S WHY SAID NOW WE HAVE TO

02:40:23.380 --> 02:40:24.581
PUT A MECHANISM THAT THEY CAN

02:40:24.648 --> 02:40:26.683
MAKE THEIR CASE AND AND DO THAT.

02:40:26.750 --> 02:40:27.451
AND WHILE SOME PEOPLE MAY

02:40:27.517 --> 02:40:28.885
DISAGREE ABOUT THE DETAILS OF

02:40:28.952 --> 02:40:30.053
WHAT WE WORKED OUT.

02:40:30.120 --> 02:40:31.254
I THINK AT LEAST WE TRIED TO

02:40:31.321 --> 02:40:32.990
TREAT THAT MECHANISM RIGHT WE

02:40:33.056 --> 02:40:34.992
ALSO TRIED TO PUT SOME MORE HELP

02:40:35.058 --> 02:40:36.626
AT SOME THAT AMENDMENTS TO TRY

02:40:36.693 --> 02:40:38.095
ADDRESS SELF DEALING I KNOW THAT

02:40:38.161 --> 02:40:39.363
SOMETHING YOU'RE A COALITION

02:40:39.429 --> 02:40:40.797
SUPPORTED A K. ATHENS -- CAME

02:40:40.864 --> 02:40:41.865
INTO MY OFFICE SAID YES WE WANT

02:40:41.932 --> 02:40:42.933
TO BE SURE WE TRY TO DEAL THE

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:44.134
SELF DEALING PART.

02:40:44.201 --> 02:40:45.502
SO TRYING TO STRIKE THIS BALANCE

02:40:45.569 --> 02:40:47.304
IN BEING SURE THAT PEOPLE LIKE

02:40:47.371 --> 02:40:48.338
MR DOES MEAN HERE.

02:40:48.405 --> 02:40:54.044
IS ARE ARE GOING TO GET.

02:40:54.111 --> 02:40:56.313
THE CARE SHE NEEDS.

02:40:56.380 --> 02:40:57.047
AT THAT ALRIGHT AT DOWN TO THAT

02:40:57.114 --> 02:40:58.815
WHAT WE'RE DOING IS IS THAT WE

02:40:58.882 --> 02:41:02.252
BUT WE'RE IN A WAY THAT ALSO.

02:41:02.319 --> 02:41:03.086
DOESN'T CREE INOPPORTUNE FOR

02:41:03.153 --> 02:41:04.354
SOMEONE SAID YOU KNOW WHAT

02:41:04.421 --> 02:41:06.156
BECAUSE WE KNOW WE HAVE TO TAKE

02:41:06.223 --> 02:41:07.157
CARE OF THESE PEOPLE THIS AN SS

02:41:07.224 --> 02:41:08.325
CITY TO DO THIS.

02:41:08.392 --> 02:41:09.893
THAT WE'RE NOW GOING TO CREATE A

02:41:09.960 --> 02:41:11.328
MECHANISM FOR WE CAN DRAW DOWN

02:41:11.395 --> 02:41:12.863
ON THE SINCE THE THE RISK FULL

02:41:12.929 --> 02:41:13.997
AND DIVERSE COOL SOUNDS LOW

02:41:14.064 --> 02:41:15.332
ADMINISTRATIVE ITSELF ABOUT IT

02:41:15.399 --> 02:41:16.833
REALLY MEANS DRISKELL MEANS.

02:41:16.900 --> 02:41:18.735
EVERYONE OF US WHO PAYS AND VICE

02:41:18.802 --> 02:41:20.003
THAT PRIVATE INSURANCE.

02:41:20.070 --> 02:41:22.139
OKAY THE OVERALL THE PEOPLE WHO

02:41:22.205 --> 02:41:23.473
ARE WORKING HARD IN THEIR JOBS

02:41:23.540 --> 02:41:25.609
WHO ARE ACTUALLY GOING ON STRIKE

02:41:25.675 --> 02:41:26.777
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO NEGOTIATE

02:41:26.843 --> 02:41:28.278
BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO KEEP

02:41:28.345 --> 02:41:29.046
THEIR HEALTHCARE.

02:41:29.112 --> 02:41:30.313
ALL RIGHT AND THEIR SWALLOWING

02:41:30.380 --> 02:41:31.848
UP ALL THEIR WAGES ALL THE

02:41:31.915 --> 02:41:32.949
INCREASE BECAUSE THE COMPANIES

02:41:33.016 --> 02:41:34.284
ARE TRYING TO MAKE MONEY YOU

02:41:34.351 --> 02:41:35.485
KNOW TRYING TO BALANCE TO LABOR

02:41:35.552 --> 02:41:36.553
COSTS ARE SAYING.

02:41:36.620 --> 02:41:37.687
OUR HEALTHCARE COSTS GOING UP

02:41:37.754 --> 02:41:38.922
ETCETERA RIGHT AND SO THAT'S

02:41:38.989 --> 02:41:40.090
CERTAINLY BEEN ISSUE WE'VE BEEN

02:41:40.157 --> 02:41:41.958
DEALING MORE BROADLY BUT WHAT WE

02:41:42.025 --> 02:41:45.095
CAN DO IS HAVE A SITUATION WHICH

02:41:45.162 --> 02:41:45.996
AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE

02:41:46.063 --> 02:41:47.297
ALICE IS I HAVE TO LOOK AT THE

02:41:47.364 --> 02:41:48.165
BIGGER PICTURE WE DON'T.

02:41:48.231 --> 02:41:50.434
WANT TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

02:41:50.500 --> 02:41:52.335
PROVIDERS AND I'M A PROVIDER --

02:41:52.402 --> 02:41:54.404
THAT WHERE BASICALLY PEOPLE CAN

02:41:54.471 --> 02:41:55.939
LEVERAGE THE RISK FOR BECAUSE

02:41:56.006 --> 02:41:57.174
THEN WE'RE GOING.

02:41:57.240 --> 02:41:59.076
TO BASICALLY DESTROYED INSURANCE

02:41:59.142 --> 02:42:00.610
MARKET IN THE END I MEAN IT'S

02:42:00.677 --> 02:42:01.678
IT'S GONNA BE MET ON WORKABLE

02:42:01.745 --> 02:42:02.746
RIGHT SO WE CAN'T HAVE PEOPLE

02:42:02.813 --> 02:42:04.247
CHERRY PICKING AND SO FORTH AND

02:42:04.314 --> 02:42:05.916
DRY AND AND DRIVING COSTS THAT

02:42:05.982 --> 02:42:06.316
WAY.

02:42:06.383 --> 02:42:07.784
ALRIGHT BUT WE NEED TO BE SURE

02:42:07.851 --> 02:42:08.752
THE INSURANCE IS THERE WHEN I

02:42:08.819 --> 02:42:09.753
NEED THEM AND I THINK THIS IS

02:42:09.820 --> 02:42:11.021
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF BEEN

02:42:11.088 --> 02:42:11.621
STRUGGLING WITH RIGHT BECAUSE

02:42:11.688 --> 02:42:13.123
WHAT ELSE WE PUT PROTECTIONS IN

02:42:13.190 --> 02:42:13.924
THE ACA WE SAID.

02:42:13.990 --> 02:42:15.292
YOU CANNOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST

02:42:15.358 --> 02:42:20.564
PEOPLE FOR PRE EXISTING

02:42:20.630 --> 02:42:21.164
CONDITION THAT'S REALLY REALLY

02:42:21.231 --> 02:42:22.632
IMPORTANT.

02:42:22.699 --> 02:42:23.800
RIGHT WE FOUGHT WE FOUGHT FUND

02:42:23.867 --> 02:42:24.401
THOUGHT BE SURE WE GOT THAT.

02:42:24.468 --> 02:42:25.168
RIGHT BUT THAT MEANS THAT

02:42:25.235 --> 02:42:26.203
INSURERS CAN'T SIT BACK AND GO

02:42:26.269 --> 02:42:27.637
YOU KNOW WHAT.

02:42:27.704 --> 02:42:28.939
SOMEONE'S HEAD NEEDS ALICE'S

02:42:29.005 --> 02:42:29.973
RIGHT HAND.

02:42:30.040 --> 02:42:31.675
TURNS OUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE WE

02:42:31.741 --> 02:42:34.177
CAN'T NEGOTIATE BECAUSE THERE'S

02:42:34.244 --> 02:42:36.079
ONLY A COUPLE BIG PLAYERS AND

02:42:36.146 --> 02:42:37.914
AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WE

02:42:37.981 --> 02:42:39.583
ARE REQUIRED BY LAW TO HAVE AN

02:42:39.649 --> 02:42:41.184
ADEQUATE NETWORK WE CAN'T

02:42:41.251 --> 02:42:42.586
NEGOTIATE ADEQUATELY SO NOW WE

02:42:42.652 --> 02:42:43.920
HAVE THAT WE NOW WE HAVE.

02:42:43.987 --> 02:42:45.388
YOU KNOW THEIR SMALL NUMBER WE

02:42:45.455 --> 02:42:46.456
HAVE T&lt;c.cyan&gt; CONTRACTED RATE&lt;/c&gt;

02:42:46.523 --> 02:42:47.691
MISSILES IS OH WOW LOOK THAT'S A

02:42:47.757 --> 02:42:48.425
GREAT RATE.

02:42:48.492 --> 02:42:50.193
AND NOW WHAT HAPPENS IS BUT THE

02:42:50.260 --> 02:42:51.761
PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO STAY

02:42:51.828 --> 02:42:52.896
ON THIS PRIVATE INSURANCE AND

02:42:52.963 --> 02:42:53.964
THEN THEY GO BE BUMPED OFF THE

02:42:54.030 --> 02:42:55.065
MEDICARE SO NOW WHATEVER THEIR

02:42:55.132 --> 02:42:56.233
CHANNEL THINGS AROUND.

02:42:56.299 --> 02:42:58.635
OKAY SO I REALIZE YOU'RE TO NOW

02:42:58.702 --> 02:42:59.436
IT'S INTERESTING YOU'RE THE ONE

02:42:59.503 --> 02:43:01.204
WHO'S SITTING HERE WE HAVE BUT I

02:43:01.271 --> 02:43:02.506
MEAN THAT THAT'S THE BALLOTS

02:43:02.572 --> 02:43:04.608
WERE TRYING TO STRIKE HERE AND I

02:43:04.674 --> 02:43:05.742
KNOW THAT'S WHAT THE SENATE

02:43:05.809 --> 02:43:07.210
WOODS WE HAVE.

02:43:07.277 --> 02:43:08.245
YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE TAKE SOME

02:43:08.311 --> 02:43:09.212
AMENDMENTS BECAUSE I THINK WE A

02:43:09.279 --> 02:43:10.113
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PINIONS ABOUT

02:43:10.180 --> 02:43:14.518
MOVIE SO WE WANT TO CREATE THE

02:43:14.584 --> 02:43:16.686
OPPORTUNITY SURE THE DIALYSIS

02:43:16.753 --> 02:43:17.053
COMPANIES WILL.

02:43:17.120 --> 02:43:18.388
GET A RUBIO REASONABLE

02:43:18.455 --> 02:43:20.724
REIMBURSEMENT PAYMENT -- ON

02:43:20.790 --> 02:43:21.958
AGAIN THIS IS AN ILL SMALL GROUP

02:43:22.025 --> 02:43:24.528
OF PATIENTS WHERE REALLY THE

02:43:24.594 --> 02:43:26.496
SITUATION IS IS THAT.

02:43:26.563 --> 02:43:28.532
THEY YOU KNOW.

02:43:28.598 --> 02:43:30.967
WHERE THERE'S THE SICKLY THERE

02:43:31.034 --> 02:43:32.302
ARE CERTAIN THAT MEAN THERE A

02:43:32.369 --> 02:43:34.971
WITH -- AT THE 280% YOUR DONORS

02:43:35.038 --> 02:43:35.572
YOU SHOULD KNOW YOUR TOES ARE

02:43:35.639 --> 02:43:37.741
ANYWAY -- AND THEN THERE 80% THE

02:43:37.807 --> 02:43:42.646
MARKET MARKET SHARE AND SO AND

02:43:42.712 --> 02:43:44.381
THEN THERE'S SENSUALLY.

02:43:44.447 --> 02:43:44.915
LEVERAGING THE POTENTIALLY

02:43:44.981 --> 02:43:46.249
LETTERING THE THE RISK FULL AND

02:43:46.316 --> 02:43:47.884
I THINK THAT'S THAT'S NOT A

02:43:47.951 --> 02:43:50.954
SITUATION THAT IS GOOD FOR OUR

02:43:51.021 --> 02:43:52.422
CURRENT HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.

02:43:52.489 --> 02:43:54.324
AND SO THAT'S THAT'S THE

02:43:54.391 --> 02:43:56.393
CHALLENGE -- I MIGHT THINK

02:43:56.459 --> 02:43:58.228
SIMILAR WOULD FOR TRYING TO

02:43:58.295 --> 02:43:59.629
ADDRESS THAT AND I REALLY

02:43:59.696 --> 02:44:01.565
APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK WE'VE

02:44:01.631 --> 02:44:03.400
BEEN ABLE TO DO TOGETHER -- AND

02:44:03.466 --> 02:44:05.368
TRYING TO CREATE SOME MECHANISMS

02:44:05.435 --> 02:44:06.703
TO PUT SOME GUARDRAILS AROUND

02:44:06.770 --> 02:44:09.139
THAT -- SO THAT -- WE STRIKE

02:44:09.206 --> 02:44:10.640
THAT BALANCE MAYBE IT'S NOT THE

02:44:10.707 --> 02:44:12.842
PERFECT BALANCE BUT I THINK THAT

02:44:12.909 --> 02:44:14.144
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

02:44:14.211 --> 02:44:15.412
AND I CERTAINLY HOPE.

02:44:15.478 --> 02:44:17.414
AND AGAIN YOU KNOW -- I WOULD

02:44:17.480 --> 02:44:20.250
URGE THE AND IT'S AND MUCH OF

02:44:20.317 --> 02:44:21.384
HIS YOU'RE SORT OF LIKE IN THE

02:44:21.451 --> 02:44:23.520
MIDDLE OF THIS -- BUT I WOULD

02:44:23.587 --> 02:44:24.955
CERTAINLY URGE -- YOU KNOW

02:44:25.021 --> 02:44:26.089
YOU'RE AN ADVOCATE FOR PEOPLE

02:44:26.156 --> 02:44:27.190
WITH KIDNEY DISEASE AND END

02:44:27.257 --> 02:44:29.292
STAGE RENAL DISEASE AND SO I

02:44:29.359 --> 02:44:31.595

OKAY THERE ARE PATIENTS LIKE

02:45:23.313 --> 02:45:24.914
CHARITABLE FOUNDATION.

IT'S A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE OF

02:46:21.871 --> 02:46:22.906
THAT.

02:46:22.972 --> 02:46:24.908
WHEN YOU CONTROL 82% OF THE

02:46:24.974 --> 02:46:26.443

BY TWO COMPANIES.

02:46:34.417 --> 02:46:36.286
THE REASON WE HAVE THE SITUATION

02:46:36.353 --> 02:46:37.787
WE HAVE IS BECAUSE OF THE

02:46:37.854 --> 02:46:39.856
CONSOLIDATION OF THE MARKET.

02:46:39.923 --> 02:46:41.224
THERE USED TO BE A WHOLE LOT OF

02:46:41.291 --> 02:46:43.193
OTHER PROVIDERS BUT THE TWO

02:46:43.259 --> 02:46:44.728
PROVIDERS THAT WE'RE TALKING

02:46:44.794 --> 02:46:45.395
ABOUT.

SHOP NEXT DOOR TO A SMALLER. ONE

02:46:52.302 --> 02:46:53.370
FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONSOLIDATION

02:46:53.436 --> 02:46:55.672
OF THE MARKET.

02:46:55.739 --> 02:46:57.574
NOW WE TALK ABOUT THE I. G.

02:46:57.640 --> 02:46:59.175
OPINION AND I WANT TO SAY.

02:46:59.242 --> 02:47:00.076
I HAVE NO ISSUE WITH THE A. K.

02:47:00.143 --> 02:47:01.644

THE A. K. F. THIS IS ABOUT A

02:47:05.382 --> 02:47:07.183
BEHAVIOR.

02:47:07.250 --> 02:47:09.085
THAT THE COMPANIES ARE USING TO

02:47:09.152 --> 02:47:10.453
REAP PROFITS.

02:47:10.520 --> 02:47:12.222
I RESPECT THE A CARE I'M HAPPY

02:47:12.288 --> 02:47:13.723
WITH WHAT THEY DO.

02:47:13.790 --> 02:47:16.793
I AM HORRIBLY DISAPPOINTED THAT

02:47:16.860 --> 02:47:18.361
TODAY WE'RE HEARING THAT THEY

02:47:18.428 --> 02:47:19.462

02:47:19.529 --> 02:47:20.830
MARKET OF CALIFORNIA.

02:47:20.897 --> 02:47:23.666
EVEN THOUGH.

02:47:23.733 --> 02:47:24.768
MISTER DESMOND WOULD NOT BE

02:47:24.834 --> 02:47:28.304
AFFECTED AT ALL BY THIS BILL.

02:47:28.371 --> 02:47:29.706
WE'RE ALSO HEARING THAT THEY'RE

02:47:29.773 --> 02:47:31.274
NOT REALLY WILLING TO SEND SOUND

02:47:31.341 --> 02:47:32.842
LIKE THEY WANT TO GO AND ASK FOR

02:47:32.909 --> 02:47:34.744

FIFTEEN HUNDRED HERE.

02:48:06.576 --> 02:48:07.277
DISAPPOINTING.

02:48:07.343 --> 02:48:09.646
REALLY DISAPPOINTING.

02:48:09.712 --> 02:48:11.648
THIS IS ABOUT COST CONTAINMENT.

02:48:11.714 --> 02:48:14.284
IF WE CAN ADDRESS.

02:48:14.350 --> 02:48:16.686
WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE A SCHEME?

02:48:16.753 --> 02:48:17.787
THAT IS DRIVING UP THE COST OF

02:48:17.854 --> 02:48:19.322
HEALTH CARE.

02:48:19.389 --> 02:48:21.925
THAT IS SO EGREGIOUS.

02:48:21.991 --> 02:48:23.460
WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO KID

02:48:23.526 --> 02:48:24.794
OURSELVES WE'RE EVER GOING TO

02:48:24.861 --> 02:48:26.095
GET TO A POINT WE CAN COVER

02:48:26.162 --> 02:48:27.363
EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE

02:48:28.631 --> 02:48:29.966
COSTS.

02:48:30.033 --> 02:48:31.201
LET'S QUIT KIDDING OURSELVES

02:48:31.267 --> 02:48:33.203
FOLKS IT WE CAN'T SUPPORT

02:48:33.269 --> 02:48:35.705
SOMETHING THE COP THAT CAN SCAN

02:48:35.772 --> 02:48:37.974
CONTAINS COSTS.

02:48:38.041 --> 02:48:39.509
BETTER SO EGREGIOUS.

02:48:39.576 --> 02:48:41.311
WHY WE EVEN BOTHERING TO TELL

02:48:41.377 --> 02:48:42.011

WE'RE NEVER GOING TO GET THERE.

02:48:47.383 --> 02:48:49.018
I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT.

02:48:49.085 --> 02:48:51.421
LAST YEAR THERE WAS NO THERE WAS

02:48:51.488 --> 02:48:52.856
NO OPINION THERE WAS NO LEGAL

02:48:52.922 --> 02:48:54.657
OPINION THERE WAS NOTHING WHEN

02:48:54.724 --> 02:48:56.125
CENTER LEYVA HAD HER BILL.

02:48:56.192 --> 02:48:58.061
THERE WAS NO OPINION THERE.

02:48:58.127 --> 02:49:00.497
I HEAR TODAY THAT THE O. I. G.'S

02:49:00.563 --> 02:49:03.333
ACTUALLY SITS ON THEIR BOARD.

02:49:03.399 --> 02:49:04.400
IS THAT WHAT I HEARD WHAT I HEAR

02:49:04.467 --> 02:49:06.336
WHATEVER I HEARD SOME THERE WAS

02:49:06.402 --> 02:49:07.570
SOME RELATIONSHIP.

02:49:07.637 --> 02:49:09.772
THAT OR SOME SOME COPY GOOD

02:49:09.839 --> 02:49:12.108
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN -- IGN AND

02:49:12.175 --> 02:49:13.877
AND THAT'S THIS MY STATEMENT

02:49:13.943 --> 02:49:18.581
THANK YOU.

02:49:18.648 --> 02:49:21.618
I JUST DISAPPOINTED THAT -- THIS

02:49:21.684 --> 02:49:22.986
TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD OPINION IS

02:49:23.052 --> 02:49:23.820
SOMEHOW TREATED LIKE THE

02:49:23.887 --> 02:49:25.088
CONSTITUTION OF THE BILL OF

02:49:25.154 --> 02:49:26.856
RIGHTS THAT IS SOME HOW

02:49:26.923 --> 02:49:28.391
COMPLETELY INVIOLABLE.

02:49:28.458 --> 02:49:29.692
DO YOU THINK THE O. I. G.

02:49:29.759 --> 02:49:31.995
ENVISIONED THIS IS THE WAY THIS

02:49:32.061 --> 02:49:32.996
WILL PLAY OUT.

02:49:33.062 --> 02:49:34.497
THAT THE COMPANIES WOULD TAKE

02:49:34.564 --> 02:49:35.999
ADVANTAGE OF THIS FOR THEIR OWN

02:49:36.065 --> 02:49:37.233
BENEFIT.

02:49:37.300 --> 02:49:39.369
DO YOU THINK THE I. T. REALLY

02:49:39.435 --> 02:49:40.703
PLANNED THAT THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.

02:49:40.770 --> 02:49:42.272
DO YOU THINK THAT IF WE ASK FOR

02:49:42.338 --> 02:49:43.339
AN OPINION THEY MIGHT SAY THE

02:49:43.406 --> 02:49:47.377
WAY IT'S HAPPENING NOW IS BAD.

02:49:47.443 --> 02:49:47.944
DO YOU THINK THEY MIGHT THAT

02:49:48.011 --> 02:49:49.779
MIGHT HAPPEN.

02:49:49.846 --> 02:49:50.713
IS THAT WHY YOU'RE AFRAID TO ASK

02:49:50.780 --> 02:49:52.849
FOR THAT OPINION.

02:49:52.916 --> 02:49:55.251
THE DONORS 82% YOUR DONATE DE

02:49:55.318 --> 02:49:56.953
DENOMINATIONS COME FROM TWO

02:49:57.020 --> 02:49:58.121
SOURCES.

02:49:58.187 --> 02:50:00.690
IS HE IS HE A K. F. FREIGHT.

02:50:00.757 --> 02:50:01.324
THAT IF THEY DON'T PULL OUT OF

02:50:01.391 --> 02:50:03.059
CALIFORNIA THAT THE TWO BIG

02:50:03.126 --> 02:50:04.894
DONORS MIGHT NOT CONTRIBUTE TO

02:50:04.961 --> 02:50:06.129
THEM IS THAT POSSIBILITY.

02:50:06.195 --> 02:50:07.830
I DON'T KNOW.

02:50:07.897 --> 02:50:09.966
MY POINT IS IS THAT I'VE I'VE

02:50:10.033 --> 02:50:11.367
OTHERS AND I AND I WILL I WILL

02:50:11.434 --> 02:50:14.137

WE HAVE A LEGAL OPINION SAYS YOU

02:50:15.538 --> 02:50:17.473
CAN'T DO THIS.

02:50:17.540 --> 02:50:18.841
SO WE GOT TO LEGAL OPINIONS.

02:50:18.908 --> 02:50:20.343

OF THE OF THAT IGNORING THE

02:50:36.559 --> 02:50:37.927
CONCLUSION.

02:50:37.994 --> 02:50:39.529

I WOULD SAY IS THAT.

03:03:55.991 --> 03:03:57.459
I THINK TO TRULY MEET THE INTENT

03:03:57.526 --> 03:03:58.994
OF THE BILL ANDERSON AND THE

03:03:59.061 --> 03:04:00.262
ISSUE AROUND SAYING WELL WHAT

03:04:00.329 --> 03:04:01.563
DOES A NATIVE SPEAKER MAIN BUT

03:04:01.630 --> 03:04:04.133
IT REALLY HAS TO BE SOMEONE.

03:04:04.199 --> 03:04:06.602
WHO UNDERSTANDS WHAT ESSENTIALLY

03:04:06.668 --> 03:04:08.637
WHAT HOW THE LANGUAGE IS SEEN IN

03:04:08.704 --> 03:04:10.472
THE COMMUNITY RIGHT OTHERWISE WE

03:04:10.539 --> 03:04:12.307
WE ACTUALLY SAW A PROBLEM --

03:04:12.374 --> 03:04:14.109
THIS YEAR -- AND THIS INVOLVED

03:04:14.176 --> 03:04:15.511
ASIAN LANGUAGE HEBREW WENT

03:04:15.577 --> 03:04:16.478
ACTUALLY DURING THE MEASLES

03:04:16.545 --> 03:04:17.646
OUTBREAK IN NEW YORK THEY PUT

03:04:17.713 --> 03:04:19.481
OUT THESE IN HEBREW AND SOMEONE

03:04:19.548 --> 03:04:20.716
DIDN'T REALLY READ AT THE OF

03:04:20.783 --> 03:04:22.050
WELL AS FROM THE COMMUNITY

03:04:22.117 --> 03:04:23.218
STANDPOINT IT DIDN'T SAY WHAT

03:04:23.285 --> 03:04:24.520
THEY WANTED TO SAY AND THAT'S A

03:04:24.586 --> 03:04:25.387
PROBLEM RATE.

03:04:25.454 --> 03:04:26.922
I KNOW THAT CERTAINLY --

03:04:26.989 --> 03:04:28.490
ACTUALLY CERTAIN DEGREE MAYBE WE

03:04:28.557 --> 03:04:29.825
SHOULD ALSO DO THIS THE ENGLISH

03:04:29.892 --> 03:04:31.193
BECAUSE OFTENTIMES WE HAVE

03:04:31.260 --> 03:04:32.327
THINGS IN LANGUAGE DOWN AND THAT

03:04:32.394 --> 03:04:33.429
ARE IN ENGLISH THAT DON'T MAKE

03:04:33.495 --> 03:04:37.232
SENSE TO MOST LAY PEOPLE AS WELL --

03:04:37.299 --> 03:04:39.034
BUT CERTAINLY -- I THINK WHEN IT

03:04:39.101 --> 03:04:42.070
COMES TO TRANSLATIONS -- NO BAD

03:04:42.137 --> 03:04:43.939
TRANSLATIONS MEAN LEAD TO

03:04:44.006 --> 03:04:45.641
MISINFORMATION AND SO I THINK

03:04:45.707 --> 03:04:47.776
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT --

03:04:47.843 --> 03:04:49.978
THAT -- WE TRADED I I'D WANTED

03:04:50.045 --> 03:04:51.980

AND SO WHAT YOU TO WORK ON THAT.

03:04:56.452 --> 03:04:58.420
BUT IT REALLY DOES MEAN SOMEBODY

03:04:58.487 --> 03:04:59.288
BEYOND JUST HAVING A PERSONAL

03:04:59.354 --> 03:05:01.457

03:05:01.523 --> 03:05:04.359

03:05:04.426 --> 03:05:04.927
RED AND PRETTY BECAUSE IT'S

03:05:04.993 --> 03:05:05.360
REALLY NOT.

03:05:05.427 --> 03:05:07.396
TRANSLATION I SHE'S ALWAYS SAY

WE HAVE INTERPRETERS WHO WORK

03:05:08.363 --> 03:05:10.065

03:24:15.810 --> 03:24:17.411

CALIFORNIA HAD INVESTED IN A

03:24:35.463 --> 03:24:36.631

INCREASING ACCESS TO HEALTH

03:50:12.331 --> 03:50:13.166
COVERAGE TO MORE MORE

03:50:13.232 --> 03:50:14.300
CALIFORNIANS.

03:50:14.367 --> 03:50:15.835
WE'RE HAPPY TO SUPPORT THOSE

03:50:15.902 --> 03:50:17.036
PROPOSALS.

03:50:17.103 --> 03:50:18.804
WE KNOW THAT -- THERE NEEDS TO

03:50:18.871 --> 03:50:19.939
BE A DIALOGUE AROUND

03:50:20.006 --> 03:50:21.207
AFFORDABILITY IN COST

03:50:21.274 --> 03:50:22.508
CONTAINMENT SUPPLEMENTS.

03:50:22.575 --> 03:50:23.809
THOSE COVERAGE INCREASES AND

03:50:23.876 --> 03:50:25.211
WE'RE HAPPY TO BE A PART OF

03:50:25.278 --> 03:50:26.879
THOSE CONVERSATIONS IN FACTWE

03:50:26.946 --> 03:50:28.481
SUPPORTED BILLS TODAY THEY GO

03:50:28.548 --> 03:50:30.216
DIRECTLY UP THE D. UNDERLYING

03:50:30.283 --> 03:50:32.385
COST OF HEALTH CARE -- IN SO

03:50:32.451 --> 03:50:33.352
WHERE DO YOU CAN YOU CONDITION

03:50:33.419 --> 03:50:34.520
OF COURSES APPEARS IN HEALTH

03:50:34.587 --> 03:50:35.988
CARE SYSTEM TO IT TO BE A PART

03:50:36.055 --> 03:50:37.423
OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS.

03:50:37.490 --> 03:50:38.624
HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THAT THIS

03:50:38.691 --> 03:50:44.931
BILL GOES IN THE EXACT OPPOSITE

03:50:44.997 --> 03:50:47.133
DIRECTION -- ONE OF MY MAIN

03:50:47.200 --> 03:50:47.800
POINTS HERE IS THAT THIS IS NOT

03:50:47.867 --> 03:50:48.401
A SIMPLE TRANSPARENCY BILL.

03:50:48.467 --> 03:50:49.068
THIS BILL IS A DIRECT REGULATORY

03:50:49.135 --> 03:50:50.636
INTERVENTION ON HEALTH PLAN

03:50:50.703 --> 03:50:52.905
RATES BETTER AGREED TO BETWEEN

03:50:52.972 --> 03:50:54.106
TWO PARTIES THE HEALTH PLANS IN

03:50:54.173 --> 03:50:55.508
THE LARGE EMPLOYERS.

03:50:55.575 --> 03:50:56.943
WE BELIEVE IT'S AN APPROPRIATE

03:50:57.009 --> 03:50:59.078
FOR THE STATE TO STEP IN BETWEEN

03:50:59.145 --> 03:51:00.046
THIS PROCESS.

03:51:00.112 --> 03:51:01.447
AND TO CHARACTERIZE THESE

03:51:01.514 --> 03:51:04.116
AGREEMENTS BY -- POTENTIALLY

03:51:04.183 --> 03:51:05.818
STAMPING THEM IS UNREASONABLE.

03:51:05.885 --> 03:51:07.787
THIS BILL IN OUR VIEW SUGGESTED

03:51:07.853 --> 03:51:09.322
SUBJECTS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF

03:51:09.388 --> 03:51:10.990
LARGE EMPLOYER PRODUCTS TO

03:51:11.057 --> 03:51:12.658
REGULATORY REVIEW PROCESS THAT

03:51:12.725 --> 03:51:14.360
WILL BE EXPENSIVE TO ADMINISTER

03:51:14.427 --> 03:51:15.261
FOR BOTH THE STATE AND THE

03:51:15.328 --> 03:51:16.629
HEALTH PLANS.

03:51:16.696 --> 03:51:18.598
THERE ARE LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF

03:51:18.664 --> 03:51:19.832
EMPLOYER PRODUCTS IN THE STATE

03:51:19.899 --> 03:51:21.267
OF CALIFORNIA.

03:51:21.334 --> 03:51:22.301
THE TEAM MADE SEE IN CD I

03:51:22.368 --> 03:51:24.070
REPORTED THIS YEAR THAN IN

03:51:24.136 --> 03:51:24.604
TWENTY EIGHTEEN THERE ARE

03:51:24.670 --> 03:51:26.138
APPROXIMATELY SEVENTEEN THOUSAND

03:51:26.205 --> 03:51:28.140
RENEWING LARGER PRODUCTS IN THE

03:51:28.207 --> 03:51:28.741
MARKET.

03:51:28.808 --> 03:51:29.408
THE BUREAUCRATIC UNDERTAKING

03:51:29.475 --> 03:51:31.777
REQUIRED BY THIS BILL WILL

03:51:31.844 --> 03:51:33.479
INCREASE HEALTHCARE COSTS.

03:51:33.546 --> 03:51:34.413
OPERATING COSTS FOR THE DO YOU

03:51:34.480 --> 03:51:35.815
NEED SEE WHICH IS ENTIRELY

03:51:35.881 --> 03:51:38.818
FUNDED BY THE HEALTH PLANS -- IN

03:51:38.884 --> 03:51:40.119
CD I WOULD RISE DUE TO IT ADDED

03:51:40.186 --> 03:51:41.387
TO MINISTRY REQUIREMENTS TO GROW

03:51:41.454 --> 03:51:42.955
THESE AGENCIES AND OF COURSE

03:51:43.022 --> 03:51:43.889
HEALTH PLANS WOULD HAVE TO TAKE

03:51:43.956 --> 03:51:45.491
ON NEW ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS TO

03:51:45.558 --> 03:51:47.593
COMPLY WITH THE V. I. REGULATORY

03:51:47.660 --> 03:51:48.561
PROCESS.

03:51:48.628 --> 03:51:49.962
SO WITH A DOUBLE WHAMMY ON OUR

03:51:50.029 --> 03:51:53.165
ADMIN LOAD -- ADDING ADDITIONAL

03:51:53.232 --> 03:51:55.101
BUREAUCRATIC RECORD BUREAUCRACY

03:51:55.167 --> 03:51:56.469
AND HEALTH CARE WILL NOT LOWER

03:51:56.535 --> 03:51:58.604
COSTS FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS

03:51:58.671 --> 03:52:00.406
INSTEAD THESE COST INCREASES

03:52:00.473 --> 03:52:02.308
WILL BE PASSED ON IT ALSO

03:52:02.375 --> 03:52:03.342
CONSUMES MORE OF THE PREMIUM

03:52:03.409 --> 03:52:05.011
DOLLAR LESS GOES ON TO DIRECT

03:52:05.077 --> 03:52:09.548
CARE MORE GOES TO ADMINISTRATION.

03:52:09.615 --> 03:52:10.983
FURTHERMORE -- AB. SEVENTY

03:52:11.050 --> 03:52:13.386
THIRTY A. B. C.'S ME -- SEVEN

03:52:13.452 --> 03:52:14.453
THIRTY ONE IS REDUNDANT OF OTHER

03:52:14.520 --> 03:52:17.556
POLICIES -- ERR OR NEXUS OF

03:52:17.623 --> 03:52:19.292
THOSE LARGE GROUP RATE

03:52:19.358 --> 03:52:21.127
INFORMATION ISCURRENTLY PUBLIC

03:52:21.193 --> 03:52:23.429
IN TRANSPARENT -- CALIFORNIA'S

03:52:23.496 --> 03:52:25.231
HEALTH PLANS ARE ALREADY SUBJECT

03:52:25.298 --> 03:52:26.132
TO A NUMBER OF DATA AND

03:52:26.198 --> 03:52:27.233
REPORTING LAWS IN OTHER

03:52:27.300 --> 03:52:29.235
TRANSPARENCY EFFORTS INCLUDING

03:52:29.302 --> 03:52:30.670
SUBMISSION OF AGGREGATED LARGE

03:52:30.736 --> 03:52:34.006
GROUP RATES. TO STATE REGULATORS.

03:52:34.073 --> 03:52:35.775
SO YES WE HAVE TRANSPARENCY

03:52:35.841 --> 03:52:38.411
ALREADY ON LARGE GROUP RATES.

03:52:38.477 --> 03:52:40.413
THIS RESULTS IN PUBLIC REPORTS

03:52:40.479 --> 03:52:41.947
BY TWO AGENCIES AND PUBLIC

03:52:42.014 --> 03:52:43.616
MEETINGS ARE HELD BY TWO

03:52:43.683 --> 03:52:44.583
DIFFERENT AGENCIES OR

03:52:44.650 --> 03:52:46.652
DEPARTMENTS AS WELL ON AN ANNUAL

03:52:46.719 --> 03:52:47.720
BASIS.

03:52:47.787 --> 03:52:48.988
SO WHAT IS THIS TRANSPARENCY

03:52:49.055 --> 03:52:51.424
SHOWN -- LARGER PREMIUM

03:52:51.490 --> 03:52:52.692
INCREASES ACCORDING TO THE LAST

03:52:52.758 --> 03:52:54.393
REPORT ARE LOWER THAN IN OTHER

03:52:54.460 --> 03:52:56.896
MARKETS OF THE HEALTH INSURANCE --

03:52:56.962 --> 03:52:59.165
UNIVERSE -- ALSO LARGE TO

03:52:59.231 --> 03:53:00.599
PREMIUMS ARE TRAINING AT A LOWER

03:53:00.666 --> 03:53:01.867
RATE THAN MEDICAL TRAINED IN

03:53:01.934 --> 03:53:03.803
PHARMACY TREND -- IN THAT'S

03:53:03.869 --> 03:53:04.837
ACCORDING TO THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN

03:53:04.904 --> 03:53:05.504
REPORTS.

03:53:05.571 --> 03:53:06.572
IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF

03:53:06.639 --> 03:53:08.641
EMPLOYEES ARE IN GOLDEN PLAN IN

03:53:08.708 --> 03:53:10.076
THE CLEVELAND BENEFIT PLANS A

03:53:10.142 --> 03:53:11.677
COMPARABLE RATES ON TO THE

03:53:11.744 --> 03:53:13.446
INDIVIDUAL MARKET SO THEY'RE

03:53:13.512 --> 03:53:17.583
GETTING A GOOD VALUE ON IN IN IN

03:53:17.650 --> 03:53:18.551
THAT MARKET.

03:53:18.617 --> 03:53:19.752
CAP IS SUPPORTED SOME OF THESE

03:53:19.819 --> 03:53:20.252
TRANSPARENCY EFFORTS ARE

03:53:20.319 --> 03:53:20.886
REFERRING TO WHEN THEY BENEFIT

03:53:20.953 --> 03:53:22.221
CONSUMERS IN THE MARKET HOWEVER

03:53:22.288 --> 03:53:23.122
WE HAVE TO STRIKE A REGIONAL

03:53:23.189 --> 03:53:24.690
BALANCE AND WE DON'T BELIEVE OF

03:53:24.757 --> 03:53:26.058
THIS BILL DOES THAT.

03:53:26.125 --> 03:53:28.227
WERE ALSO INVOLVED IN THE HEALTH

03:53:28.294 --> 03:53:29.562
PAYMENTS DATA REVIEW COMMITTEE

03:53:29.628 --> 03:53:30.896
THAT WAS ESTABLISHED ASKYOU

03:53:30.963 --> 03:53:31.964
YEAR.

03:53:32.031 --> 03:53:33.733
OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE ALL PAYER

03:53:33.799 --> 03:53:36.068
CLAIMS DATABASE -- AND SO THE

03:53:36.135 --> 03:53:37.370
PURPOSE OF THIS COMMITTEES TO

03:53:37.436 --> 03:53:38.404
ESTABLISH TIME YOU KNOW --

03:53:38.471 --> 03:53:41.173
SYSTEM WIDE TRANSPARENCY ON IN

03:53:41.240 --> 03:53:43.042
THE EFFORT TO LOWER COSTS IN AND

03:53:43.109 --> 03:53:44.543
YOU KNOW WE'RE HOPEFUL WE CAN

03:53:44.610 --> 03:53:47.146
COME TO SOME SORT OF STOP

03:53:47.213 --> 03:53:48.848
POSITIVE STRUCTURE AROUND THAT --

03:53:48.914 --> 03:53:49.915
SO ON TOP OF EVERYTHING THAT'S

03:53:49.982 --> 03:53:51.183
BEEN CURRENTLY DONE WE DON'T

03:53:51.250 --> 03:53:52.418
BELIEVE IS A COMPELLING REASON

03:53:52.485 --> 03:53:54.453
NOW IT'S YOU REQUIRE LARGE GROUP

03:53:54.520 --> 03:53:56.188
RATES TO BE SUBJECT TO REVIEW.

03:53:56.255 --> 03:53:57.790
FOR REQUIRE OUR PLAS TO TO

03:53:57.857 --> 03:53:59.024

03:53:59.091 --> 03:54:00.326
NEW INFORMATION.

03:54:00.393 --> 03:54:03.529
THERE FOR WE ASK YOU TO VOTE NO

03:54:03.596 --> 03:54:04.163
ON EIGHTY SEVEN THIRTY ONE THANK

03:54:04.230 --> 03:54:06.632
YOU. SEVEN WALK INS ON BEHALF OF

03:54:06.699 --> 03:54:08.100
THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA

03:54:08.167 --> 03:54:09.168
LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE

03:54:09.235 --> 03:54:11.437
COMPANIES WE TO HEAR ARE OPPOSED

03:54:11.504 --> 03:54:12.671
TO THIS MEASURE.

03:54:12.738 --> 03:54:14.673
UNFORTUNATELY WE DO SEE THIS IT

03:54:14.740 --> 03:54:16.509
IS EXPANSION THE REGULATORY

03:54:16.575 --> 03:54:19.145
AUTHORITY I'M INTERESTED JUSTICE

03:54:19.211 --> 03:54:20.946
NOT UNDERSCORE WHAT MY COLLEAGUE

03:54:21.013 --> 03:54:22.515
MENTIONED BUT WHEN THE OVER MUCH

03:54:22.581 --> 03:54:24.216
ABOUT MY ADMINISTRATION PUT

03:54:24.283 --> 03:54:25.317
TOGETHER RATE REVIEW THEY

03:54:25.384 --> 03:54:27.520
SPECIFICALLY DID LOOK AT THE

03:54:27.586 --> 03:54:28.888
SMALL AN INDIVIDUAL GROUP

03:54:28.954 --> 03:54:30.022
MARKETS.

03:54:30.089 --> 03:54:31.056
POTENTIALLY THOSE ARE PRICE

03:54:31.123 --> 03:54:32.591
TAKERS THERE'S NO NEGOTIATION

03:54:32.658 --> 03:54:33.959
THERE THIS ARE OFF THE SHELF

03:54:34.026 --> 03:54:35.494
PRODUCTS AND AS THEY LOOKED AT

03:54:35.561 --> 03:54:36.662
LARGE GROUP THEY ACTUALLY

03:54:36.729 --> 03:54:38.230
UNDERSCORED.

03:54:38.297 --> 03:54:38.731
THE FACT THAT THESE ARE

03:54:38.798 --> 03:54:40.966
SOPHISTICATED ENTITIES.

03:54:41.033 --> 03:54:42.468
IT'S AN INCREDIBLY COMPETITIVE

03:54:42.535 --> 03:54:44.470
MARKET PLACE THAT OUR MEMBERS

03:54:44.537 --> 03:54:45.704
STRIVE TO PROVIDE AS MUCH

03:54:45.771 --> 03:54:47.673
INFORMATION AND DISCLOSE AS MUCH

03:54:47.740 --> 03:54:49.542
INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE TO LET

03:54:49.608 --> 03:54:50.643
THEM KNOW WHAT GOES INTO THE

03:54:50.709 --> 03:54:52.845
RATE DEVELOPMENT AND WHAT THEIR

03:54:52.912 --> 03:54:54.413
PREMIUM VALUE GETS THEM.

03:54:54.480 --> 03:54:55.614
SO WHEN WE DID ADOPT IN

03:54:55.681 --> 03:54:57.550
CALIFORNIA LAW THE ORIGINAL RATE

03:54:57.616 --> 03:54:58.851
REVIEW A DID HAVE A TRIGGER

03:54:58.918 --> 03:55:00.152
MECHANISM THAT IF THE FEDERAL

03:55:00.219 --> 03:55:01.720
GOVERNMENT DID CHOOSE AT SOME

03:55:01.787 --> 03:55:03.222
POINT TO ADD LARGE GROUP.

03:55:03.289 --> 03:55:04.457
THAT IT WOULD AUTOMATICALLY

03:55:04.523 --> 03:55:06.258
TRIGGER ON IN CALIFORNIA SO

03:55:06.325 --> 03:55:07.526
THAT'S ONE OF THE CONCERNS IS

03:55:07.593 --> 03:55:09.595
THAT THROUGH THAT PROCESS AT NO

03:55:09.662 --> 03:55:10.763
TIME TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

03:55:10.830 --> 03:55:11.630
AND UNDER THE OBAMA

03:55:11.697 --> 03:55:13.132
ADMINISTRATION CHOOSE INCLUDE

03:55:13.199 --> 03:55:14.533
LARGE GROUP WE THINK THAT'S

03:55:14.600 --> 03:55:16.335
BECAUSE THEY DID ACKNOWLEDGE THE

03:55:16.402 --> 03:55:17.937
SOPHISTICATION OF THOSE ENTITIES.

03:55:18.003 --> 03:55:19.104
AND THE ABILITY FOR THEM TO

03:55:19.171 --> 03:55:21.707
NEGOTIATE THE BEST RATES AND

03:55:21.774 --> 03:55:22.842
BENEFITS STRUCTURES FOR THEIR

03:55:22.908 --> 03:55:24.410
MEBER COMPANIES SO WE ARE

03:55:24.477 --> 03:55:25.744
CONCERNED CERTAINLY WITH

03:55:25.811 --> 03:55:27.346
ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS

03:55:27.413 --> 03:55:29.148
IN BURDEN TO THE DEPARTMENTS WE

03:55:29.215 --> 03:55:30.015
HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE

03:55:30.082 --> 03:55:31.450
DEPARTMENT'S ABILITY TO MOVE

03:55:31.517 --> 03:55:33.352
THROUGH THE LARGE VOLUME OF RATE.

03:55:33.419 --> 03:55:34.920
AND FILINGS AND FOR THOSE

03:55:34.987 --> 03:55:37.089
REASONS WE CONTINUE TO BE

03:55:37.156 --> 03:55:40.659
OPPOSED TO THE BILL THANK YOU.

OF THE BILL ITSELF IS ACTUALLY --

03:57:13.519 --> 03:57:14.587

04:32:30.333 --> 04:32:31.435
