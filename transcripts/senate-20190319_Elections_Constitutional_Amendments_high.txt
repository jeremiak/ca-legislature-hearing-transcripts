ALL RIGHT LEAGUE COMMITTEE RULES ARE ADOPTED -- NEXT WE HAVE SB TWENTY SEVEN BY SEVEN REQUIRES AND REQUIRES HERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SIR MCGUIRE. MORNING MR CHAIR GOOD MORNING MISTER VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF VERY GRATEFUL TO BE WITH YOU WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT SAY THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR AND TWO IS. A FANTASTIC STAFF TEAM FOR THE WORK ON SB TWENTY SEVEN THE PRESIDENTIAL TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT. BUT AS WE ALL KNOW MEMBERS TRANSPARENCY IS A NON PARTISAN ISSUE IN A TRANSPARENCY THAT PROVIDES THE BASIS OF ACCOUNTABILITY IN OUR GOVERNMENT. FOR THE PAST FORTY YEARS EVERY US PRESIDENT REPUBLICANS AND% DEMOCRATS ALIKE HAVE RELEASED THEIR TAX RETURNS. THESE PATRIOTS BUT THE NATION'S INTERESTS ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE. PRESIDENTS ARE EXPECTED TO PUT THEIR OWN INTERESTS ASIDE WEATHERBY BUSINESS TIES TO RELATIONSHIPS WITH A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT FOR THE RATE GREATER GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY. AND THAT GREATER GOOD IS AMERICAN SECURITY IN THE PROTECTION OF ITS PEOPLE. INCOME TAX RETURNS FROM PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE THE POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST DOMESTIC INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS DEALINGS. FINANCIAL STATUS IN CHARITABLE DONATIONS AND WHILE THE RELEASING OF TAX RETURNS AS FAR CONVERSATION IN YES ABSOLUTELY DEBATE THROUGHOUT THE PAST. ALL CANDIDATES TO PUT THEIR DEATHS DISCOMFORT ASIDE FOR THE PAST FOUR DECADES BECAUSE A RELEASE NO TAX RETURNS HAS BECOME A TIME HONORED TRADITION IN AMERICA. THIS TIME HONORED TRADITION CAME -- CAME TO AN ABRUPT HALT IN THIS LATEST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP REFUSED TO RELEASE HIS INCOME TAX RETURNS WHICH DENIED VOTERS OPPORTUNITY TO FULLY EVALUATE. HIS FITNESS FOR THE OFFICE OF THE PRESS AND UNITED STATES AND THAT'S WHY SENATOR WINNER AND I BRING FORWARD SB TWENTY SEVEN TO ENSURE THAT FUTURE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES WILL BE BARRED FROM APPEARING. ON THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY BALLOT UNLESS RELEASE RETURNS TO VOTERS. THERE ARE PRESSING QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ANSWERED FAR BEFORE ELECTION DAY MISTER CHAIR. BECAUSE UNLIKE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND FEDERAL APPOINTEES PRESIDENTS ARE COMPLETELY EXEMPT FROM CONTRACT CONFLICT OF INTEREST LOTS. THAT MEANS ALL OF US ALL OF US AS MEMBERS THE STATE LEGISLATURE ALONG WITH LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS FROM SANITARY DISTRICT COMMISSIONERS TO CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS AND MEMBERS OF COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. DISCLOSE MORE INFORMATION THROUGH MANDATE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST DOCUMENT VIOLENCE IN THE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. VOTERS DESERVE TO KNOW FOR EXAMPLE IF HE PRESIDENT WHOEVER HE OR SHE MAY BE IN THE FUTURE IS PUT IN AMERICA'S SECURITY RISK. THROUGH TANGLED WEB BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH CORPORATE INTERESTS OR DEALINGS WITH FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND FOREIGN BANKS. THERE'S A LOT AT STAKE. THE PRESIDENT SHIPPING TAX POLICY WHICH WILL BENEFIT THE RICHEST AMERICANS HE'S HERE SHE IS RITA. SHAPING INTERNATIONAL POLICY WHICH COULD ENRICH THEMSELVES IN THE AMERICAN PUBLIC HAS NO WAY TO KNOW BECAUSE FOREIGN INVESTMENTS ARE UNDISCLOSED IF TAX RTURNS ARE NOT EXPOSED TO THE PUBLIC. THE PRESIDENT PROPOSES LUCRATIVE MULTI BILLION DOLLAR CONTRACTS OF MAJOR CORPORATIONS THE PUBLIC HAS NO UNDERSTANDING OF THE POTENTIAL TIES TO THESE BUSINESSES IF INCOME TAX RETURNS ARE NOT. ADVANCE. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS A STRONG EXAMPLE OF THE NEED OF THIS% LEGISLATIONBUT I WANT TO BE CLEAR. HE'S NOT THE ONLY. ONE THIS BILL HAS BEEN AND NEVER WILL BE ABOUT ONE SPECIFIC PERSON OR POLITICAL PARTY. IT'S MUCH BIGGER THAN THAT. CALIFORNIA VOTERS DESERVE TO KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT ALL PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES BEFORE CASTING THEIR VOTE AS AMERICANS. IN THE ASENCE OF A FEDERAL LAW MANDATING THAT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES TURN OVER THEIR INCOME TAX RETURNS LIST LEGISLATION BE SPECIFIC. TO CALIFORNIA IN REQUIRE THREE SPECIFIC ITEMS NUMBER ONE I CAñADA FOR PRESENT IN ORDER TO HAVE HIS OR HER NAME PLACED UPON A PRIMARY ELECTION BALLOT. THE FILE HIS OR HER INCOME TAX RETURN. FOR THE FIVE MOST RATE RECENT TAX BEFORE THE ELECTION PROTECT INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY THE SECRETARY STATE WILL REACT THE INCOME TAX RETURNS ARE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES. TO MY RIGHT THERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW THIS IS DONE IN PRIOR ELECTION CYCLES FROM CANADA TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON THIS TIME HONORED TRADITION WE PROVIDED TWO EXAMPLES ONE FROM. TWO THOUSAND FIVE FROM GEORGE W. BUSH THE ONE FROM TWO THOUSAND EIGHT R. FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA. AS YOU CAN SEE SO SECURITY NUMBERS -- AND PERSONAL ADDRESSES ARE REDACTED IN SOME PRESIDENT OBAMA LEFT HIS PERSONAL ADDRESS IN. BUT ALL VERY SPECIFIC INFORMATION RELATED TO PERSONAL SECURITY -- BIKE SO SCARY NUMBERS HAVE BEEN REDACTED. THE RETURNS MUST BE AVAILABLE. THIRD POINT TO THE PUBLIC ON THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S WEBSITE. STATES HAVE AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN PROVIDING CHECKS AND BALANCES THE FEDERAL POLICY IN FACT BY THE POWER OF THE U. S. CONSTITUTION STATES HAVE THE RIGHT TO DETERMINE BALLOT ACCESS REQUIREMENTS. CENTER WIENER AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH SOME OF THE BRIGHTEST CONSTITUTIONAL ATTORNEYS IN THE NATION TO ENSURE THE STRENGTH OF THIS PROPOSED LAWS ABLE TO WITHSTAND. ANY POTENTIAL COURT CHALLENGES. VOTERS NOT ONLY DESERVE FULL DISCLOSURE THE FUTURE LEADERS TAX RETURNS THEY SHOULD BE ENTITLED. TO FINDING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. SB TWENTY SEVENS BALLOT ACCESS REQUIREMENTS OF RELEASING TAX RETURNS IS LIKE OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL BALLOT ACCESS REQUIREMENTS EVERYONE CAN COMPLY WITH HERE IN THE GOLDEN STATE. HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF WHAT ABOUT ACCESS REQUIREMENT IS. SIGNATURE GATHER REQUIREMENTS FILING FEES. THE MIDDLE DEADLINES TO THE SECTOR A STATE. SB TWENTY SEVEN IS UNLIKE UNCONSTITUTIONAL ABOUT ACCESS REQUIREMENTS WHICH CAN BE IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPLY WITH TERM LIMITS. RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS FOR LANGUAGE TO ONE'S NAME IN THE BALLOT SITTING THEY SERVED. TOO MANY TERMS. THE CHIEF ETHICS COUNCIL FOR GEORGE W. BUSH [inaudible] MR PAINTER. THE CHIEF ETHICS COUNCIL FOR BROCK OBAMA MISTER ICE IN HAVE BOTH REVIEWED THIS LANGUAGE IN DECLARED THAT THEY BELIEVE IT STANDS A CONSTITUTIONALLY TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL TEST. OTHER PEOPLE CAN DEBATE THE POINT BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THESE TWO PARTISAN EXPERTS A GREEN IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST INDEPENDENT REVIEW WE CAN GET. SB TWENTY SEVEN IS SUPPORTED BY THE SECRETARY STATE. WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL TO MISTER VIDEO THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION COURAGE CAMPAIGN AMERICAN AND AMERICANS FOR TAX EARNS AMONG MANY OTHERS. I'M GRATEFUL MISTER CHAIR TO HAVE WITH US TODAY MISS MOCK WHO IS THE DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS AT THE CALIFORNIA SECRETARY STATE WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR HER WORK IN THE SECTOR HAS WORKED. IN HIS RAMACHANDRAN. A PROFESSOR OF LAW AT THE SOUTHWESTERN LAW SCHOOL RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME AGAINST YOUR THANK YOU FOR THE WORK ON THIS BILL. AND YOU HAVE SOME WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. YOU LIKELY HEARD. KAREN MEMBERS TIFFANY MARK ON BEHALF OF THE SECRETARY STATE ALEX PADILLA. FOR REASONS WE HAVE HEARD WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE AND WE BELIEVE IT'S AN IMPORTANT TRAINS PERISHED. IMPORTANT TRANSPARENCY FOR TAXPAYERS THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRPERSON THANK YOU I'M KALORAMA CHANDRAN I'M A PROFESSOR OF LAW AT SOUTHWESTERN LAW SCHOOL ALTHOUGH I'M SPEAKING ON MY OWN BEHALF NOT ON BEHALF OF THE LAW SCHOOL -- I TEACH CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION AND I SUPERVISE THE NINTH CIRCUIT APPELLATE LITIGATION CLINIC -- I BELIEVE THE BILL IS CONSTITUTIONAL IT WOULD VERY LIKELY WOULD STAND ANY LEGAL CHALLENGE -- AND THAT'S BECAUSE STATES HAVE BROADER USABLE REGULAIONS OF BALLOT ACCESS TO CANDIDATES. EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY NOT QUALIFICATIONS -- LISTED IN THE CONSTITUTION FOR FEDERAL OFFICE FIRST THE BILL IS A REASONABLE REGULATION OF BALLOT ACCESS BECAUSE IT PROMOTES A STATE AND VOTER INTEREST THAT'S NOT ONLY LEGITIMATE IT'S COMPELLING. IT DOES SO WITHOUT CREATING ANY ONEROUS OBLIGATIONS FOR COMPLIANCE -- THE INTEREST OF COURSE IS INFORMATION FOR VOTERS ABOUT CANDIDATES FINANCIAL INTERESTS AND THAT INTEREST IS PROMOTED WITHOUT REQUIRING THE CANDIDATES TO FILE EXTREMELY EARLY TOGETHER LARGE NUMBERS OF PETITION SIGNATURES OR MOVE THEIR RESIDENCE -- IT'S VERY EASY FOR CANDIDATES TO COMPLY WITH THE BILL. SECOND UNLIKE LAWS THAT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY CHALLENGED BECAUSE THEY SEEK TO DISPARAGE CANDIDATES WERE MISLEAD VOTERS SB TWENTY SEVEN DOES NOT PRINT ANY INFORMATION MUCH LESS DISPARAGING OR MISLEADING INFORMATION ON THE BALLOT. IT MERELY PLACES THE TAX RETURNS ON THE SECRETARY OF STATE WEBSITE AND VOTERS MAY LOOK UP OR IGNORE THE INFORMATION AS THEY PLEASE -- AS THEY SEE FIT. FINALLY THE BILL IS A BALLOT ACCESS PROVISION BECAUSE I'D RATHER THAN AN ADDED QUALIFICATION FOR OFFICE BECAUSE THE UNDERLYING DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE BEHIND THAT DISTINCTION IS THAT VOTERS NEED TO BE FREE TO CHOOSE CANDIDATES OF THEIR CHOICE. UNLIKE A LAW THAT IMPOSES A TERM LIMIT OR A RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT SB TWENTY SEVEN DOESN'T RESTRICT VOTERS CHOICE BECAUSE THERE'S NO PERSON WHO THE VOTERS MIGHT WISH TO VOTE FOR WHO CANNOT COMPLY. WITH THE PROVISION CERTAINLY SOME VOTERS MAY BE ON INTERESTED IN THE TAX INFORMATION BUT THERE'S NO LEGITIMATE VOTER INTEREST IN KEEPING THAT INFORMATION FROM OTHER VOTERS WHO ARE INTERESTED. THERE'S NO INTEREST IN THE CANDIDATE NOT PERHAPS HAVING A POWERFUL INCUMBENT REPRESENT THEM -- FINALLY BECAUSE THE BILL ONLY APPLIES TO PRIMARY ELECTIONS THERE'S NO CONCERN THAT CALIFORNIA'S BALLOT WOULD UNDERMINE NATIONAL POPULAR VOTE COUNTS. FOR EXAMPLE IF MR TRUMP FAILS TO COMPLY WITH SB TWENTY SEVEN AND TWENTY TWENTY AND HE DOES NOT APPEAR ON THE PRIMARY BALLOT IN CALIFORNIA. SO LONG AS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY NOMINATES HIM HE WILL STILL APPEAR ON THE GENERAL BALLOT AT THEIR FOR THE NATIONAL INTEREST IN BEING ABLE TO ASSESS POPULAR WILL. AND THE GENERAL POPULAR VOTE COUNT THAT WOULD NOT BE UNDERMINED -- AT ALL SO IN SOME I BELIEVE THE BILL VERY LIKELY BE UPHELD IN THE COURTS BECAUSE IT PROMOTES RATHER THAN UNDERMINING -- THE CONSTITUTIONAL INTERESTS OF VOTERS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU PROFESSOR A COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS -- ASSUMING THIS BECOMES LAW AND A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DOES NOT COMPLY DOES NOT PROVIDE HIS OR HER TAX RETURNS SO THEY CAN APPEAR ON THE PRIMARY BALLOT BY UNDERSTAND YOUR TESTIMONY SORRY. THE CRACKS BUT THEY DO APPEAR ON THE GENERAL ELECTION BALLOT IS THAT RIGHT. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY NOMINATES THAT PERSON OR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY DOES YES THEY WOULD STILL DOES THE DOES THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY DO THEY HAVE A MECHANISM SEPARATE APART FROM. THE PERIOD OF PRIMARY BALLOT TO THAT APPEAR ON THE GENERAL ELECTION BALLOT -- WELL THAT AT TWO MAJOR PARTIES THEY CHOOSE AT THEIR CONVENTIONS WHO THEY ARE WHO THEY WILL BE NOMINATING -- AND SO THEY INSURE THAT YOU KNOW WHOEVER THEY NOMINATED HE CONVENTION WOULD APPEAR ON THE GENERAL. THE GENERAL BALLOT JUST FOLKS IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY SO IRRESPECTIVE OF THE VOTE IN THE PRIMARY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY CAN NOMINATE A DIFFERENT CANDIDATE. IS THAT IS THAT ACCURATE -- IT DEPENDS ON THEIR OWN INTERNAL X. FOR AYE ON THAT BUT SURE THERE FOR YOURSELF. THIS MOCK. THAT'S RIGHT SAME THING WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IRRESPECTIVE OF WHOEVER RECEIVES THE MOST VOTES IN THE PRIMARY REPUBLICAN PARTY COURTNEY THEIR OWN RULES IN CALIFORNIA YOU CAN NOMINATE ANOTHER PERSON [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. WELL YOU LEARN SOMETHING NEW EVERYDAY -- AND A WITH RESPECT TO THE CIRCUIT COURTS IS ANY CIRCUIT COURT RULED ON A SIMILAR OF FEDERAL CIRCUIT COURT RULED ON ANY SIMILAR PROVISION. I'M I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY FEDERAL CIRCUIT COURT RULING IN A SIMILAR PROVISION THERE IS A FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN ALABAMA THAT UP HELD -- A BALLOT ACCESS PROVISION WHERE ALABAMA REQUIRED A FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE STATEMENT THAT DISCLOSURE ITSELF WAS NOT BEING CHALLENGED BUT RATHER THE TIMING OF NEEDING TO FILE IT BUT THAT THAT WAS UPHELD. THAT WAS FOR THE PRESIDENT -- HOT NO THAT WA FOR OUR LOCAL ALABAMA OFFICES. OKAY YEAH OURNOSE FEDERAL OFFICE AS I BELIEVE IT -- IT WAS FEDERAL OFFICES I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS FOR PRESIDENT THOUGH YEAH. AND IN WAS THAT UP HELD BY WHICHEVER CIRCUIT ALABAMA FALLS WITHIN -- I BELIEVE IT WAS NOT APPEALED -- SO THERE'S JUST A DISTRICT COURT OPINION ON THAT NOT A CIRCUIT LEVEL OPINION SO IT IS LAW EXISTS RIGHT NOW IN ALABAMA. IN ORDER TO FOR THE PRESIDENT OR FOR CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY TO APPEAR ON THE BALLOT THERE HAS TO BE SOME SORT OF FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE IS THAT ACCURATE. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THAT LAW APPLIED TO CANDIDATES FOR PRESIDENT BUT IT WAS A FOR FEDERAL OFFICES TO PROBABLY -- CONGRESSIONAL OFFICES YEAH. ALL RIGHT -- OTHERS. OTHER OTHERS IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATORS TERRY BRENNAN ABOUT HALF OF SCA YOU CALIFORNIA -- AND STRONG SUPPORTER THIS AYE I JUST. PAUSE FOR A MOMENT THANK YOU HAVE MORE FINANCIAL INFORMATION. ON EVERY APPOINTEE THAT COMES FOR THIS BODY FOR CONFIRMATION THAT WE HAD ON THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS TROSZYN BROWN OF CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS ARE LETTERS NOT IN BECAUSE OUR CONVENTION IS THIS WEEKEND WHERE WE WILL RATIFY OUR POSITIONS BUT WE ARE RECOMMENDING A SUPPORT ON THIS BILL AND HOPE TO SEE IT THROUGH. THANK YOU YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MITCH SNIDER WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION OF STRONG SUPPORT. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION YES SIR THANK YOU SIR I AM NOT RICHARD WINGER WITH BALLOT ACCESS NEWS THE HANDOUTS. ARE THE FIRST PRESIDENT EVER ISSUED ON THIS KIND OF ISSUE AND THE LAST. ONE THERE WERE NO GOVERNMENT PRINTED BALLOTS UNTIL EIGHTEEN NINETY SO THIS COULDN'T COME UP BUT ONCE THE GOVERNMENT STARTED PRINTING BALLOTS. THEN THERE ARE CONTROVERSIES ABOUT WHAT. COULD THE STATE'S DUE TO EXCLUDE PEOPLE. THE VERY FIRST CASE WAS FROM THE MINNESOTA SUPREME COURT IN. NINETEEN EIGHTEEN IT'S ONLY ONE PAGE. IT HAS NO PRECEDENCE MENTIONED IN IT BECAUSE IT WAS A CASE OF FIRST IMPRESSION THE PERSON HAD BEEN CONVICTED OF A FELONY. AND HE WANTED TO RUN IN A PRIMARY FOR CONGRESS. AND THE MINNESOTA SUPREME COURT SAID UNANIMOUSLY. THE STATE CAN. KEEP THEM OFF THE BALLOT. THE LAST ONE WHICH IS FOUR PAGES. IS ALSO BY COINCIDENCE FROM THE MINNESOTA SUPREME COURT. THERE WAS A DENTIST. IN SAINT PAUL. WHO SET FIRE TO HIS OWN OFFICE? AND TO AVOID PROSECUTION HE FLED TO ROME ITALY. AND HE HAD FILED FOR CONGRESS AND HE WAS ON THE BALLOT AND THEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE TOOK HIM OFF. BECAUSE HE SAID HE COULDN'T POSSIBLY SERVICE ELECTED IF HE SET FOOT IN THE STATE HE'LL BE ARRESTED. BUT THE MINNESOTA SUPREME COURT SAID [inaudible] DOESN'T MATTER. THE STATE CAN'T CONTROL WHO GETS ON THE BALLOT FOR FEDERAL OFFICE -- OF COURSE THE STATE'S CONTROL FILING FEES. AND PETITIONS BECAUSE IT'S A NECESSITY. BUT THEY DO THAT BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE ELECTION ADMINISTRATORS COULDN'T RUN THE ELECTION BUT THAT'S IT. AND THE NINTH CIRCUIT HAS SPOKEN ABOUT THAT [inaudible] IN -- SCHAEFER VERSUS TOWNSON THEY SAID THE TERM LIMITS COURT. REJECTED SUCH A BROAD READING OF THE ELECTIONS CLAUSE AND HELD THE BALANCING TEST IN APPLICABLE. WHERE THE CHALLENGE PROVISION SUPPLEMENTED THE QUALIFICATIONS CLAUSE? AND DID NOT REGULATE A PROCEDURAL ASPECT OF AN ELECTION OR REQUIRE A CANDIDATE TO SHOW A MINIMUM LEVEL SUPPORT. NOW WHETHER YOU SO YOUR TAX RETURNS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ELECTION ADMINISTRATION BUT THE STATE'S POWER STOPS WITH ELECTION ADMINISTRATION. AND I WANT TO SAY IS IMPORTANT IS THIS ISSUE IS THE SOMETHING FAR MORE IMPORTANT. THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION THE MOST RADICAL. DEMOCRATIC ASPECT OF THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION WAS IT ANYBODY AGE TWENTY FIVE WHO IS A CITIZEN. COULD RUN FOR THE HOUSE THAT WAS SHOCKING BACK THEN ALL THE STATE SAID TO BE IN THE LEGISLATURE YOU HAD YOU HAD ON PROPERTY. AND THEY'RE EVEN ISN'T SEARCH -- STILL SOME STATES SAID SEARCH STATE SEARCHESAND THERE ARE EVEN SOME RELIGIOUS TEST. SO THE PEOPLE IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WERE VERY PROUD OF THIS AND VERY AWARE OF IT AND JOSEPH STORY WROTE ABOUT IT. AND THAT'S WHY IN MY LETTER TO EACH ONE OF YOU. I FOUND TWELVE CASES ON WHETHER CRIMINALS COULD RUN FOR FEDERAL OFFICE AND THEY'RE ALL UNANIMOUS THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE DESCENT. SO I'LL STOP THERE. THEY STAY HERE -- OKAY WHATEVER YOU CHOOSE I'D LIKE TO THINK OF ANY QUESTIONS YES THE RESTAURANT. THANK YOU MISTER -- THANK CENTER FOR BRING IT BACK. AND HOPEFULLY WE MAKE SOME PROGRESS THIS YEAR TOO BAD WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO RUN THIS LEGISLATION AT ALL. AND WE CAN'T JUST. RESOLVE THIS LIKE EVERY OTHER NORMAL PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HAS DONE. AND WE'LL SEE WHAT THE HOUSE ACTUALLY DOES HERE TO YOU BRING IN PERSISTING BRAINY ISSUE FOR THEY JUST WANNA GIVE. I'M SORRY I MISSED YOUR NAME PROFESSOR. RAMACHANDRAN RAMACHANDRAN -- THE EIGHT JUST COMMENTING ON SORT OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN -- THIS KIND OF QUALIFICATION OR SORT OF PROCEDURAL STEP THAT YOU THAT THIS BILL WOULD TAKE VERSUS SAY A PROPERTY OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENT HOW DO YOU SEE THAT THAT CONSTITUTIONAL DISTINCTION IN TERMS OF THIS BEING A PURELY PROCEDURAL -- QUALIFICATION IN NATURE TO TO SATISFY SOME OF THESE TERM LIMITS CONCERNS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. THE MAIN DISTINCTION I WOULD SEE IS THAT -- IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE IN FACT IT'S VERY EASY FOR EVERY CANDIDATE TO COMPLY WITH THIS PROCEDURAL STOP WERE AS OWNING PROPERTY YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE INDIGENT CAN'T JUST SUDDENLY. ACQUIRE PROPERTY SO THIS DOESN'T ACTUALLY EXCLUDE ANYBODY BECAUSE EVERYBODY CAN COMPLY WITH THE PROCEDURAL. WITH THE PROCEDURE SO THERE'S THERE'S NO ONE BASICALLY WHO WHO. WHO WOULD BE DISQUALIFIED IN THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA -- WHO IS A CITIZEN OF THE U. S. TO TO ACTUALLY I MEAN PROVIDED THEY'RE PAYING THEIR TAXES? THERE IS NO IMPEDIMENT IN OTHER WORDS TO MEETING THAT QUALIFICATION -- YES THEY JUST HAVE TO DISCLOSE -- THOSE FILINGS YEAH -- ALL RIGHT. ONE QUICK THING -- ONE QUICK THING OKAY THE TENTH CIRCUIT HAD A CASE WHERE THERE WAS A COLORADO MAN WHO REFUSED TO REGISTER TO VOTE. HE WAS A RESIDENT COLORADO IT WOULD BEEN THE EASIEST THING IN THE WORLD FROM THE REGISTER BUT HE WOULDN'T. HE STILL ONE IN US DISTRICT COURT. AND CIRCUIT THREE TO NOTHING COLORADO S. FOR SUPREME COURT REVIEW IT WAS DENIED. IT'S VERY EASY TO REGISTER TO VOTE BUT THE STATE'S CAN'T EVEN MAKE A PERSON DO THAT. THANK YOU MISTER WINNER ITEM I'M SURE THAT. IN YOUR ME GUESS YOU WILL SAY ALL THE THINGS YOU SAID TODAY PLUS MORE -- ALREADY THERE'S BEEN A MOTION -- MADAM SECRETARY -- I'M SORRY YOU WERE CLOSE THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR DESIGNERS AGAIN SAY THANK YOU AND WHAT I'LL JUST ENDED WITH THIS. ITEM LINE IS THERE IS NO PRECEDENT. THERE IS NO LEGAL PRECEDENT IN ANY DISTRICT COURT ACROSS THIS COUNTRY ON THIS ISSUE. AND THE REASON WHY THERE IS NO LEGAL PRECEDENT IS BECAUSE IT EVERYONE OTHER AT THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES BOTH MAJOR PARTY IN MINOR HAVE DISCLOSE YOUR TAX RETURNS. AS WHAT SENATOR STERN YOU JUST STATED THE ONLY REASON WE'RE HERE IS BECAUSE FORTY YEARS A PRESENT HAS BEEN BROKEN -- AND WHAT I'LL STRESS IS THIS. IT HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR. THAT WE CANNOT PUT TERM LIMITS. ON TO A FEDERAL HOUSE SENATE PRESIDENT KENNEDY IN CALIFORNIA WE CAN'T. ISSUE RESIDENTS REQUIREMENTS WE CAN DO BALLOT ACCESS. THERE IS NO ONE IN THIS COUNTRY. NO MATTER IF YOU FILE TAXES OR IF YOU DO THAT WOULD BEING DENIED ACCESS TO THE PRIMARY ABOUT IN CALIFORNIA. THROUGH THIS BILL. IT IS CLEAR AS CHAIR I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATE MCGUIRE BENCIC CRITICAL. MOTION IS TO PASS TO SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. NUMBER HI NUMBER I NIELSEN. NIELSEN NO HERTZBERG. LEYVA. LEYVA AYE STERN STERN I ALL RIGHT THE THE BILL MOVE ON TO US SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- WHAT LET'S BOOK WILL KEEP THE ROLE OPEN -- TO THE END OF THE HEARING. ALL RIGHT -- THERE LEYVA THEIR LEVEL. THANK YOU SIR. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR GOOD MORNING MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. IN ORDER TO CLARIFY THE APPROPRIATE USE OF POLITICAL FUNDS SB SEVENTY ONE WILL PROHIBIT LEGAL DEFENSE AND CAMPAIGN FUNDS FROM BEING USED. TO PAYOR REIMBURSE A CANDIDATE OR ELECTED OFFICIAL FOR LEGAL COSTS RELATED TO CLAIMS OF UNLAWFUL PRACTICES DEFINED UNDER THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT VIDAK. UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF FEE HA UNLAWFUL PRACTICES ARE DEFINED TO INCLUDE ACTS OF HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION RETALIATION ON THE BASIS OF RACE PHYSICAL OR MENTAL DISABILITY GENDER AGE MILITARY AND VETERAN STATUS. RELIGIOUS RELIGIOUS CREED AND MANY MORE SUPPORTERS DONATED TO POLITICAL FUNDS FOR A SPECIFIC PURPOSE NONE OF WHICH INCLUDES FUNDING CANDIDATES ELECTED OFFICIALS OR COMMITTEES BAD BEHAVIOR. ALTHOUGH THE NEED FOR THIS BILL AROSE OUT OF A CLAIM RELATING TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT SB SEVENTY ONE WILL INCLUDE ALL ACTS OF HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE ALL SUCH BEHAVIOR IS UNACCEPTABLE. ALFI HEART RELATED VIOLATIONS SHOULD BE HANDLED WITH THE SAME VIGOR AND SERIOUSNESS OF ALL OTHERS. SB SEVENTY ONE WILL FINALLY CLOSE A LOOPHOLE THAT COULD ALLOW HARASSERS TO USE POLITICAL FUNDS TO DEFEND THEIR OUTRAGEOUS ACTIONS HERE WITH ME IN SUPPORT IS PHILIP I'M FROM THE FAIR POLITICAL PRACTICES COMMISSION STRONG. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FELL UPON LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE BIPARTISAN FAIR POLITICAL PRACTICES COMMISSION ARE COMMISSION VOTED IN DECEMBER -- TO SPONSOR THIS LEGISLATION WERE HAPPY TO PARTNER -- WITH SENATOR LEYVA TO MOVE THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION FORWARD SO WE CAN CLEARLY DEFINE -- THE IMPORTANT USE OF CAMPAIGN FUNDS AND LEGAL DEFENSE FUNDS IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. OF THE THANK YOU MISTER óNG -- BEFORE WE GET GOING HERE LET ME AT LEAST EXPRESS MY PERSONAL POINT OF VIEW THAT. THOSE WHO HARASS OTHERS OR THOSE WHO UNLAWFULLY DISCRIMINATE AGAINST OTHERS -- SHOULD NOT BE REWARDED MANY FASHION IN FACT -- I AM COMPLETELY SUPPORT THE CONCEPT OF ENSURING THAT THOSE WHO HAVE ACTUALLY MOBILE THOSE WHO ACTUALLY. COMMITTED A WRONG THOSE WHO ACTUALLY DISCRIMINATED UNLAWFUL BASIS NOT BE PERMITTED TO USE CAMPAIGN FUNDS TO ULTIMATELY DEFEND THEMSELVES -- HAVING SAID THAT THOUGH I I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS FOR YOU MISTER ON IN TERMS OF COMPLAINTS. DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY A PPC COMPLAINTS RECEIVED THE LAST YEAR -- AB SURF WHAT COMPLAINTS JUST -- IS GENERATED IN GENERAL COMPLAINTS RIGHT I'M A BALLPARK THIS BALLPARK FIND. A TEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE RECEIVED A LITTLE UNDER TWO THOUSAND COMPLAINTS. SO OF THOSE TWO THOUSAND COMPLAINTS HOW MANY WERE INVESTIGATED -- YOU KNOW I'D HAVE TO I HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT SENATOR THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION THAT I DON'T WANT -- TO TO MISQUOTE MY STAFF ON AND BUT BUT YEAH THE THOSE TWO THOUSAND COMPLAINTS INCLUDE SWUNG COMPLAINTS AND AND REFERRALS FROM FILING OFFICERS ACROSS THE STATE BUT I CAN GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT SPECIFIC NUMBER OF HOW MANY WERE INVESTIGATED. OKAY OF THOSE TWO THOUSAND COMPLAINTS. WERE ALL OF THEM INVESTIGATED NOW. OR HALF OF THEM INVESTIGATED -- I WOULD. AGAIN I CAN'T I I KNOW THAT NOT ALL OF THEM VESTED I DON'T KNOW IF HALF OF THEM -- OF SOME AHEAD. OFTHOSE TWO THOUSAND COMPLAINTS WERE ANY OF THEM DETERMINE TO BE UNFOUNDED IN OTHER WORDS THAT THERE WASN'T EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE ALLEGATION [inaudible] YES. ANY SENSE OF HOW MANY -- I WOULD SAY IN THE HUNDREDS -- BUT I'M SURE THAT'S NOT VERY HELPFUL. BUT BUT IT'S IT'S BUT WE WE GENERALLY GET COMPLAINTS WERE PEOPLE ARE SOMETIMES FILED ON BECAUSE SOMETIMES THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE LAW -- OR THEY BELIEVE ARE THERE IS FORMAT -- WHEN WHEN REALLY THE PULLOVER FORMAT DOESN'T COVER WHAT IT IS THAT THEY THEY THOUGHT THE VIOLATION WAS -- ONE EXAMPLE IS WE WE WE GET A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS -- BY SIGNIFICANT I MEAN -- IS NOT INSIGNIFICANT -- COMPLAINTS FROM VOTERS WHO BELIEVE THAT IF THERE'S A LYING IN AN AD THAT THAT'S A VIOLATION OF POLITICAL REFORM ACT -- BUT LYING IS NOT -- ILLEGAL IN THE UNITED STATES -- AND IN REGARDS TO POLITICAL ADVERTISING AND SO -- WE HAVE TO TELL THEM THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I'M OR THEY BELIEVE THAT THEIR THAT THE DISCLOSURE IS INCORRECT AND RELATE IS CORRECT BECAUSE THEY DISCLOSURE LAWS ARE QUITE COMPLEX NOW -- SO THAT'S THOSE ARE SOME OF THE EXAMPLES OF COMPLAINTS THAT WE GET THAT THAT ARE SOMETIMES ON FOUNDED. ALL RIGHT I THINK WHAT YOU SAID THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS THAT WERE FOUND TO BE UNFOUNDED RIGHT. OKAY IN IN ANY OF THOSE COMPLAINTS THAT WERE FOUND TO BE UNFOUNDED WAS ANYBODY FIND. NO WE DON'T FIND PEOPLE ON ON FOUND COMPLAINTS -- SO IT IN TERMS OF THE BILL OF SB SEVENTY ONE HOW WOULD IT WORK WITH RESPECT TO INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURE COMMITTEES. WHAT WOULD APPLY TO IT? WHAT AND APPENDIX MANAGEMENT IS A COMMITTEES THAT MAKE INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURES I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY BECAUSE OUR? BUT WHAT WHAT WE BREAK IT DOWN BOTH WAYS OKAY -- WATER. FOR COMMITTEES AND MAKE INDEPENDENCE MANAGERS IT WOULD IT WOULD APPLY TO THEM -- AND THAT -- IF IF THEY WANTED TO USE TO DEFEND AGAINST A CLAIM -- OF UNLAWFUL PRACTICES UNDER FEE HOW THAT THAT WE WERE UNDER THE SPELL THAT WOULD NOT BE PERMITTED. TO SO SO WHO WOULD. WHO WOULD PAY SO FOR EXAMPLE FOR COUNCIL? OR HOWWOULD THAT BE PAID MORE APPROPRIATELY THE PERSON WHO WOULD BE -- LIKELY THAT THE THE SUBJECT OF THE CLAIM. SO FOR EXAMPLE LET'S SAY THE COMMITTEES THE SUBJECT THE CLAIM THAT THE COMMITTEE IS NAMED BASED ON SOME VIOLATION OF FEE HA. SO. SOMEBODY WOULD NEED TO SPEND PERSONAL FUNDS RIGHT. TO TO DEFEND THE ACTION -- I GUESS I HAVE TO A I HAVE TO A CLARITY FROM YOU. MISTER CHAIR ABOUT HOW A COMMITTEE COULD BE BROUGHT AGAINST A CLAIM -- BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU WOULD NEED A PERSON TO VIOLATE AND I'M AWFUL PRACTICE OF THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING ACT. WELL THE SO YOU COULD BRING A CLAIM OF FEE HOW CLAIM AGAINT AND AND A BUSINESS FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT -- YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK INTO THAT -- BUT BUT I BELIEVE THAT THE CLAIM WOULD BE AGAINST LIKELY I'M A MANAGER. MAKING A DECISION -- ON BEHALF OF THAT ORGANIZATION AND IT'S THE MANAGER THAT THE CLAIM WILL BE BROUGHT AGAINST OKAY. ASSEMBLY IS NOT BROUGHT AGAINST THE MANAGERS BROUGHT AGAINST THE COMMITTEE JUST LIKE -- AGAINST THE BUSINESS. WOULD WOULD EACH CONTRIBUTOR BE REQUIRED TO USE THE AND IT. I THINK THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION CENTER -- I DON'T THINK CAN INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTORS ARE. OB CAPTURED IN THIS BILL I THINK IT WOULD BE THE LIKELY THE CAMPAIGN MANAGER -- OR OR PERSON. WHO MADE THAT EMPLOYMENT DECISION? IN ONE OF ITS BROUGHT AGAINST THE THE POLITICAL PARTY SO FOR EXAMPLE LET'S SAY THERE'S A CLAIM AGAINST THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY ITSELF. HOW WOULD THAT WORK THE DATE IS I UNDERSTAND THE BILL THAT THE PARTY COULD NOT USE -- CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS TO DEFEND ITSELF THE RIGHT -- THAT IS THAT IS CORRECT INTO THE BILL BUT AGAIN WE HAVE TO GO BACK -- TO BUT THE INDIVIDUAL WHO MADE THAT EMPLOYMENT THAT EITHER HARASSING -- ACTION OR DISCRIMINATORY ACTION -- THEY WOULD BE THE ONES WHO WOULD BE PERSONAL LIABLE FOR TO PAY THOSE LEGAL COSTS. I UNDERSTAND BUT IF IS BROUGHT AGAINST AN INDIVIDUAL IN THE PARTY AS WELL FOR EXAMPLE FOR FAILURE. TO ADEQUATELY SUPERVISE HOW DOES THAT WORK HOW DOES IT WORK FOR THE PARTY TO PAY FOR ITS DEFENSE. OUTSIDE OF CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS. FROM WHAT YOU KNOW I THINK PARTIES ARE A A UNIQUE -- ENTITY AND THAT I THINK THERE -- THEY DO HAVE -- LOOK INTO IT BUT I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE FOR COMMITTEE OR PARTIES TO HAVE FUNDS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF CAMPAIGN. CONTRIBUTIONS. BUT THERE ARE OTHER REVENUES THAT THAT -- POTENTIALLY COULD BE USED WHETHER IT'S INTERESTS ARM OFF OF THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS OR OR OTHER -- OTHER DONATIONS THAT ARE NOT CONTRIBUTIONS BUT I'LL HAVE TO LOOK INTO AND GET BACK TO YOU. I'M NOT AWARE OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO POLITICAL PARTIES THAT ARE NOT CONTRIBUTIONS AGAIN I I CAN GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT YEAH AND IF I MAY. MY MY THOUGHT IS IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WHO IS ACCUSED OF HARASSMENT. AND THE PERSON GOES AFTER THEM AND THEY TRY TO GO AFTER THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY THERE WOULD BE NO MONEY FOR THEM TO GO AFTER. BECAUSE OF THIS BILL SAYS THIS IF BILL THIS BILLS AND LAW IT SAYS YOU CAN'T USE THE MONEY TO DEFEND YOURSELF THERE'S NO MONEY FOR THEM TO GO AFTER THERE WOULD BE NO WAY FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY TO PAY FOR IT. WELL SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A JUDGMENT AGAINST DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THEY OWN REAL ESTATE. COULDN'T SOMEBODY LEVY AGAINST THAT REAL ESTATE. I DON'T KNOW DO WE OWN PARTNER ON PROPERTY. BUT I DO SEE THERE'S NO THERE WOULD BE NO MONEY THAT THIS IS ABOUT THIS THIS BILL IS ABOUT GOING AFTER PEOPLE ELECTED LIKE US IN THIS ROOM THAT DO THINGS THAT THEY SHOULDN'T DO THAT ARE INAPPROPRIATE. AND THEIR CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS SHOULD NOT BE THERE AS A SLUSH FUND FOR THEM TO GRAB AND USE TO PER -- TO PROMOTE THAT BAD BEHAVIOR OR DEFEND THAT BAD BEHAVIOR. I THINK WE CAN ALWAYS LOOK FOR A WAY TO TO FROM NOT DO SOMETHING. BUT THIS IS TRYING TO PREVENT SOMETHING THAT WE KNOW IS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME AND WE AS ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE NOT ABOVE THE LAW WE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO USE OUR CAMPAIGN FUNDS FOR OUR BAD BEHAVIOR. I THINK YOUR QUESTIONS ARE ALL LEGITIMATE I THINK WE CAN GET YOU THE ANSWERS THAT YOU NEED BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY DO WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING OR DO WE WANT TO FIND A WAY NOT TO DO IT. SO LET ME LET ME JUST CONTINUE WITH MISS OUT ON HERE A FEW MORE QUESTIONS SO. LET ME GIVE YOU A HYPOTHETICAL SO A VOLUNTEER ON A CAMPAIGN IS POSTING LAWN SIGNS. IN THEIR DRIVING IN THEIR INVOLVED AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT. THE PERSON WHO WAS INJURED IN THE AUTO RELAX AND SUSE THAT CAMPAIGN VOLUNTEER IN THE CAMPAIGN. COULD THE CANDIDATE USE CAMPAIGN FUNDS TO DEFEND HERSELF. UNDER THAT SCENARIO -- YEAH THAT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION ON WHETHER THEY USE CAMPAIGN FUNDS TO DEFEND. AGAINST THE POTENTIAL NEGLIGENCE CLAIM ON BEHALF OF A VOLUNTEER CORRECT -- I'M NOT SURE WE'VE I'VE SEEN THAT SCENARIO -- I THINK THAT WITH SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVE TO ASK OUR LEGAL DIVISION FOR ADVICE OF WHETHER NOT THAT THE PROPER USE OF CAMPAIGN FUNDS. AND I BELIEVE MOST OF US ARM HAD INSURANCE FOR THAT WHEN WE RAN OUR CAMPAIGN SO PROBABLY THE INSURANCE IS WHAT WE WOULD USE. THAT'S A THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION IT COULD YOU USE CAMPAIGN FUNDS FOR EXAMPLE THE TO INSURE AGAINST. OF FOR EXAMPLE A WRONGFUL DEATH ACTION DO YOU KNOW. THE W. PROHIBITED USE OF CAMPAIGN FUNDS. UP PURCHASING INSURANCE I I IS IS A PERMITTED USE -- IN OUR MANUAL WE DISCUSS -- HEALTH INSURANCE OF VEHICLE INSURANCE -- WRONGFUL DEATH INSURANCE IS NOT SOMETHING THAT I'VE I'VE READ IN OUR MANUAL SO AGAIN THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE TO ASK OUR LEGAL DIVISION. I DON'T I DON'T THINK YOU CAN HELP ME OUT HERE I DON'T THINK YOU CAN SURE AGAINST. INTENTIONAL ACTS SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN'T BUY INSURANCE. TO AGAINST AN INTENTIONAL ACT OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. IS THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING. FIVE I'VE NOT HEARD OF AN INSURANCE POLICY OF THAT TYPE. SO IF A CANDIDATE FOR EXAMPLE LET'S JUST ASSUME. THAT AND I TAKE YOUR POINT CENTER LEYVA THAT THIS BILL IS FOCUSED ON THOSE WHO HAVE COMMITTED THE ACTS. THAT THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO PUNISH THOSE WHO. HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING WRONG FULL. RIGHT SO. IF IF FOR EXAMPLE AT A CANDIDATE. HAS DONE NOTHING WRONG NOTHING WRONG. OKAY LET'S JUST ASSUME THAT FOR THIS HYPOTHETICAL. BUT IS ALLEGED TO HAVE DONE SOMETHING WRONG. THAT CAN BE COULD NOT USE CAMPAIGN FUNDS TO DEFEND HERSELF IS THAT RIGHT. IN THIS IN IN THE SCENARIO OF A FEE HA VIOLATION RIGHT -- THAT IS THAT IS CORRECT. SO FOR EXAMPLE -- LET LET'S SAY THE CANDIDATE HAS A BATHROOM IS NOT ADA COMPLIANT THEN GETS SUED FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE ADA. THEN THAT CANDIDATE COULD NOT USE CAMPAIGN FUNDS THAT IS DEFEND HERSELF AGAINST DELEGATION OF HAVING A BATHROOMS NOT ADA COMPLIANT IS THAT THAT. YOU UNDERSTANDING. BUT THAT WOULD BE AN EIGHTY A VIOLATION I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WOULD FALL UNDER A VIOLATION OF THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING AT WELL I THINK THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING AYE PROTECTS -- AGAINST DISCRIMINATION BASED ON PHYSICAL DISABILITY IS AS WELL DOESN'T -- I BELIEVE SO YEAH BUT IT IN YOUR SCENARIO YOU BROUGHT UP A VIOLATION OF THE AMERICAN DISABILITIES ACT INSIDE AND IT I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON WHERE THE CLAIM. WELL THAT WAS A YEAR OF FEE HOW CLAIMS FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE AMERICAN DISABILITIES ACT THAT THEN CAN THEY COULD NOT% USE. FUNDS TO DEFEND HERSELF IS THAT RIGHT -- I BUT I BELIEVE SO YES ALL RIGHT. SO LET'S SAY. THE OF VOLUNTEER COMES IN ONCE TO WALK PRECINCTS AND FOR EXAMPLE HAS SOME SORT OF EITHER PHYSICAL OR MENTAL DISABILITY THAT PRECLUDES THEM FROM BEING ABLE TO TALK TO INDIVIDUALS AT THE DOOR. AND THEY FILE A CLAIM. FOR DISCRIMINATION BASED ON THE PHYSICAL OR MENTAL DISABILITY. THEN CAN THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DEFEND HERSELF FROM THAT CLAIM RIGHT. USING USING CAMPAIGN FUNDS. ASSUMING ASSUMING THAT THERE WAS NO DISCRIMINATION BUT JUST THAT THE ALLEGATION [inaudible] WELL I IF THERE'S AN ALLEGATION FILED UNDER AN AWFUL PRACTICE CLAIM OF A FEE HA THEN YES THIS BILL WOULD. WOULD PROHIBIT THAT YOU SEE CAMPAIGN A LEGAL DEFENSE FUND EVEN ASSUMING THAT THERE IS ACTUALLY NO FOUND VIOLATION CORRECT -- ASSUMING THERE IS NO PHAM VIOLATION THAT IS THAT IS CORRECT. JUST CURIOUS IN TERMS AT P. P.'S POSITION YET IS THE F. P. P.'S POSITION THAT IRRESPECTIVE OF THE CULPABILITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL THAT. THAT THERE IS NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN THOSE THAT ARE CULPABLE IN THOSE ARE NOT CULPABLE IN TERMS OF OF USING CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS THAT THAT PPC POSITION. I BELIEVE THAT THAT THAT IS OUR POSITION. YES. OKAY -- IT IN. IN TERMS OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO AND I'M FOCUSED ON CANDIDATES RIGHT NOW -- SO IF A CANDIDATE AGAIN ASSUMING THAT THE KENNEDYS DONE NOTHING WRONG. ALL RIGHT. THE SENATE CAN LAYS THE NOTHING WRONG IN IS SUED -- WEALTHY CANDIDATE COULD PAY OUT OF HIS OR HER OWN POCKET RIGHT I GUESS THIS IS NO PROHIBITION ON THAT MEAN THEY'RE WILLING TO PUT UP THOSE PERSONAL FUNDS YES BUT A CANDIDATE THAT IS NOT WEALTHY. BASICALLY WHAT WHAT IT WHAT IS THEIR RECOURSE -- WELL EVERY COURSE WOULD BE -- THAT THEY COULD -- THEY COULD ASK FOR PRO BONO LEGAL SERVICE. OKAY -- ORTEGA IS FOR FREE LEGAL SERVICE OKAY WHAT ELSE -- THEY COULD ALSO. IT'S A I'VE TO APOLOGIZE MISTER CHAIR AT I'M RACKING MY BRAIN -- THEY GO BANKRUPT IS WHAT THEY DO RIGHT. I MEAN THEY THEY DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DEFEND THEMSELVES. SO THEY BASICALLY ALLOW THE CLAIM TO GO FORWARD IF FOUND. OR EVEN IF NOT FOUND LET'S ASSUME THE NOT FOUND. THE THE THE JUST. THE COST OF OF WHATEVER THEY CAN AFFORD. BASICALLY FORCES THEM TO BANKRUPTCY. IF I MAY IT'S KIND OF LIKE LIFE IS NOW RIGHT IF YOU'RE RICH YOU CAN BUY YOUR WAY OUT OF SOMETHING IF NOT YOU SEXUALLY HARASSED SOMEONE AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY DEFEND YOURSELF. THEN MAYBE YOU DON'T HAVE A DEFENSE I I I THINK THAT WE SHOULDN'T MAKE THIS ABOUT BEING RICH OR POOR AND THAT THE ONLY REASON YOU CAN DEFEND YOURSELF IS BECAUSE YOU'RE ELECTED YOU HAVE A CAMPAIGN FUND. DON'T DO THE BEHAVIOR AND THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT I I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GO WILL WORRIED ABOUT THAT PERSON WHO IS FALSELY ACCUSED WHICH WE DO A LOT RIGHT WE WORRY ABOUT THE FALSELY ACCUSED PERSON IN THE SMALL PERCENTAGE. WE DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ACTUALLY BEING HARASSED OR SEXUALLY HARASSED OR DISCRIMINATED AGAINST. THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO PROTECT WITH THIS BILL WE DON'T WANT ANYONE FROM NOT ANYONE FALSELY ACCUSED TO GET CAUGHT UP IN THAT. BUT WE CANNOT HELP SOMEONE'S VACATE BEHAVIOR I CAN ONLY CONTROL CONNIE LABOR'S BEHAVIOR SO I'M NOT A RICH WOMAN SO I DON'T SEXUALLY HARASSED PEOPLE BECAUSE I COULDN'T DEFEND MYSELF I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO DO IT. I I UNDERSTAND CENTER AND I AND I IS A SAID AT THE OUTSET I I THINK THE CONCEPT IS BOTH IMPORTANT. AND IS WELL FOUNDED THE QUESTION IS IS THAT SINCE WE'RE IN THIS BILL WE DON'T DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THOSE WHO HAVE ARRESTED THOSE WHO ARE SIMPLY ACCUSED OF HARASSMENT. IS MISTER óNG IS INDICATED THAT THERE ARE OF UNFOUNDED. F. PPC AND HE LIKES WHAT THEY WERE THAT MOST PEOPLE CALL BECAUSE THEY WANT TO KNOW IF IT'S A GREAT ALLY THEY WANT TO KNOW IF THE DISCLOSURE VIOLATIONS ARE THERE. THESE ARE NOT SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIMS ARE NOT HUNDREDS OF THOSE THAT ARE UNFOUNDED SO I JUST WANNA BE CLEAR. AND I ALSO WANT TO CLARIFY MISTER CHAIR THAT WE WOULDN'T BE INVESTIGATING THESE FEEL VIOLATIONS -- WE WOULD ONLY BE INVESTIGATING -- WHEN SOMEBODY WOULD BE SPENDING FUNDS TO DEFEND THEMSELF A FILE CLAIM RELATED TO AFFIRM PLACEMENT HOUSING AT? NOT THE ACTUAL ALLEGATIONS WE WILL LEAVE THAT TO OF THOSE WHO SPECIALIZE IN THOSE INVESTIGATIONS THAT BEING THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING. THE RESPECTIVE RULES COMMITTEES OF THIS -- LET OF THIS LEGISLATURE ANY OTHER AGENCIES HR DEPARTMENT. BUT SO IS I UNDERSTAND THAT SO SOMEBODY FILES A FEE HOCK. COMPLAINT OR EVEN MAKES AN ALLEGATION MAKES AN ALLEGATION THAT FALLS WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF FEE HOP. THAT MOMENT NO CAMPAIGN FUNDS CAN BE USED TO DEFEND HERSELF IS THAT RIGHT -- OR LEGAL DEFENSE FUND YEAH RIGHT OKAY. AND LATER ON IF IT'S DETERMINED THAT THAT PERSON COMMITTED NO VIOLATION. SHE SIMPLY OUT A LOT RIGHT. WELL I THINK THERE THERE MAY BE OTHER -- COURT REMEDIES -- THE PERSON AND THE ACCUSE COULD SEEK ATTORNEY'S FEES FROM THE ACCUSER -- IF IT -- IF THE CLAIM OVER DEFAMATION CLAIM THOSE ARE THINGS THAT YOU COULD USE CAMPAIGN FUNDS -- TO PURSUE A DEFAMATION CLAIM -- SO THERE ARE OTHER LEGAL REMEDIES -- TO OF RECOURSE TO TO RESTORE YOURSELF FINANCIALLY AT THAT -- IF THAT IS SOMETHING THAT ACCOUNT I'M NOT I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT'S CORRECT -- I DO THINK THERE'S A LITIGATION PRIVILEGE SO I THINK OF FEE HAWK CLAIM FALLS WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF A LITIGATION PRIVILEGE SO IN OTHER WORDS THERE'S IF IF YOU DO IN THE CONTEXT OF A FEE HOW CLAIM. THAT YOU ARE PROTECTED FROM A DEFAMATION CLICK BUT OKAY -- HAVING SAID THAT I I WOULD BE INTERESTED WITH RESPECT TO WHETHER OR NOT. IT WOULD BE LEGAL TO USE CAMPAIGN FUNDS TO DEFEND YOURSELF IT WOULD BE LEGAL CLEARLY TO DEFEND YOURSELF AGAINST A DEFAMATION ACTION RIGHT. YES ARE THERE WOULD BE CLEARLY LEGAL TO ACTUALLY PURSUE A DEFAMATION ACTION RIGHT. YES RIGHT. IN THE QUESTION REMAINS AS TO WHETHER IF YOU ARE SUED FOR EXAMPLE VOLUNTEER WHO'S INVOLVED IN A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT -- WHETHER OR NOT YOU COULD LOSE IN AND IN THE COURSE AND SCOPE OF PERFORMING CAMPAIGN ACTIVITIES WHETHER OR NOT YOU COULD USE CAMPAIGN FUNDS TO DEFEND YOURSELF IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE. SO THAT I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN KNOWING THAT -- ALL RIGHT TO THE SO I THINK I'VE EXPRESSED MY CONCERNS MY CONCERNS ARE TO WORK WITH YOU CENTER LEYVA. TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THOSE WHO ARE CULPABLE AND THOSE WHO ARE NOT CULPABLE -- OTHERS OTHERS -- WHAT WILL TAKE OTHERS IN SUPPORT? NICHOLS HAD ON WITH CALIFORNIA COME BECAUSE WE'RE IN SUPPORT WITHIN THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO TRAIN DELINEATE. APPROPRIATE IN IN A PER REDUCE CAMPAIGN FUNDS WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT MEASURE TO PROMOTE PUBLIC TRUST THANK. OTHERS IN SUPPORT [inaudible] OPPOSITION [inaudible] QUESTIONS [inaudible] SENATE STERN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU CENTER FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD IN -- YEAH THIS IS THIS IS TOUGH STUFF BUT WE OUGHT TO HOLD OURSELVES TO ACCOUNT. SO I APPRECIATE YOU -- PUSHING THE ENVELOPE HERE -- THIS QUESTION ABOUT PRO BONO COUNSEL CAN WE JUST DRILL DOWN ON THAT ONE REAL QUICK BECAUSE IS THAT. IF YOU WERE WITH THE P. CAN CAN. CAN OF CANDIDATES TAKE PRO BONO COUNSEL AND AND IT ISN'T A GIFT OF SOME SORT OR WOULDN'T IT BE SOME KIND OF CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION YOU'RE SAYING LIKE YOU TAKE PRO BONO LEGAL COUNSEL THEN YOU'D FILE. SOME KIND OF REPORT ON THE VALUE OF THAT COUNCIL THAT YOU'D BE GETTING NEITHER WAS I'M THINKING OF HIS ALTERNATE RECOURSE YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS. YEAH -- I BELIEVE THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHEN PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN PRO BONO COUNSEL WHERE. IT. A WOULD BE. I THINK WHY IT WOULD BE CONSIDERED A GIFT UNDER YOUR SCENARIO -- BUT FROM FREE SERVICES I'VE I'VE SEEN PRO BONO SERVICES -- PREPPY -- REPORTED ON BE HAS A PAYMENT REPORTS -- THERE'S A THERE'S A PATHWAY TO RECEIVING THAT KIND OF YES THERE IS YES OKAY. THE THE THE THE CONCERN I GUESS I HAVE ALSO IS BACK TO THE PREVIOUS SECTION THE GOVERNMENT CODE IN EIGHTY FIVE THIRTY THREE OR FOUR A THE SORT OF CLICKING THROUGH THE BILL BECAUSE WE'RE COVERING FEE HA CLAIMS. BUT AM I READING THIS RIGHT THAT YOU STILL CAN. HIS CAMPAIGN FUNDS DEFEND YOURSELF AGAINST. CIVIL OR CRIMINAL. VIOLATIONS OF ANOTHER SORT THE OTHER. THAT'S CORRECT -- IF IT'S OF RELATED -- TO POLITICAL LEGISLATIVE ARE GOVERNMENTAL PURPOSE. POLITICAL LEGISLATIVE OR GOVERNMENTAL PURPOSE OKAY SO THAT SO IN THAT CASE THAT THE LIKE YEAH I F. PPC CLAIM WOULD BE YOU COULD USE YOUR CAMPAIGN FUNDS TO DEFEND AGAINST AN FTP C.. VIOLATION IT LIKE AN ADMINISTRATIVE CLAIM WAR -- EAT YOU USE THIS -- THIS POTENTIAL NEGLIGENCE SCENARIO -- AND SOMEONE'S IN IN THE COURSE OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT SORT OF OPERATING AS AN EMPLOYEE ON BEHALF OF THE CAMPAIGN HIT SOMEBODY NEGLIGENTLY AND THEN THEY'D BE VICARIOUSLY LIABLE. YOU COULD USE FUNDS TO DEFEND THAT BUT IT'S IT'S THE FEE HIGHS THE DELINEATION IS THAT THE THE WAY. THE STRUCTURE THE BILL SO LIKE. NON FEE HA. IN GENERAL JUST THAT'S THAT'S TOTAL THROUGHOUT THE HISTORY OF THE ACT THE THE VOTERS IN THE LEGISLATURE -- WHEN THEY ADOPTED WILL BE CALLED THE P. L. G. EXCEPTION THE POLITICAL I JUST EVER GOVERNMENTAL -- USE OF FUNDS -- AND AND SAID THAT THESE FUNDS ARE HELD IN TRUST FOR THOSE PURPOSES -- THE LEGISLATION THE VOTERS HAVE THE AT DOZENS OF TIMES TO INCLUDE WHAT IS AND IS NOT AN APPROPRIATE USE OF CAMPAIGN FUNDS. EVERYTHING FROM HOME SECURITY SYSTEMS -- TO TO AS YOU DESCRIBED LITIGATION COSTS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN BUY A SUIT -- OR AT AND IF IT GETS VERY DETAIL AND ALSO GETS VERY BROAD AND SO THE ACTION OR THE PROPOSAL THAT CENTER LEYVA IN THE ABUSE YOUR BRINGING TODAY IS NOT UNPRECEDENTED -- THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN. DECIDE HOW THESE FUNDS THAT ARE HELD IN TRUST ARE USED -- ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S USED IN A WAY THAT IS NOT -- NOT SOLELY PROTECTED BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND EXPENDITURE OF OF COMMUNICATING WITH VOTERS. THE GUY I THINK THERE'S A A A A GOOD PATH TO RESOLUTION HERE THAT JUST WORKS YOUR TO COMPRESSED ON TIME FRANKLY TO TO SORT IT OUT BUT I THINK. THERE'S THIS LINE BETWEEN. CULPABILITY AN ACCUSATION THAT IS NOT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE BINARY RIGHT SO THAT I THINK THERE'S A WAY. TO LOOK AT WE GO THROUGH SUBSTANTIATION PROCESS FOR WITH OUR AND THE WORKPLACE CONDUCT COMMITTEE WOULD WE SET UP LAST YEAR IS THAT WHAT IT'S CALLED. THE COMEDIAN WORKPLACE CONDUCT IN REFERS THROUGH THAT PANEL TO RULES COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT THAT SUBSTANTIATION PROCESS. ISN'T NECESSARILY A FINDING OF CULPABILITY BUT IT IS SOME KIND OF THRESHOLD OF SUBSTANTIATION MAYBE THERE COULD BE SOMETHING THAT LIES IN THERE WERE YOU'RE SAYING OKAY IT'S MORE LIKELY THAN NOT. THIS INDIVIDUAL COMMITTED THIS AT YOU KNOW VIOLATION OF THE HOT BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY YOU KNOW A CRIMINAL OR CIVIL CULPABILITY ON THAT FRONT WE'RE WE'RE SORT OF STRETCHED. FOR TIME IN SPACE BUT I WOULD JUST ASK. CONSIDER SOMETHING IN THAT GRAY AREA THERE BECAUSE I WANT THE SENATE PROCESS TO WORK. RIGHT AS IT SHOULD AND I'M I'M THINKING. BUT I BUT I ALSO TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU THAT WE SHOULDN'T. YOU KNOW THOSE WHO ACTUALLY HAVE. YOU KNOW SUBSTANTIALLY CLAIMS AGAINST THEM AND NOT NOT THIS REALLY VIOLATIONS RIGHT YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT -- THEY'RE ALREADY CONVICTED OR YOU'RE SORT OF DELAYING JUSTICE FOR YEARS AND YEARS TO SEE BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW HOW QUICKLY THESE THINGS WILL PLAY OUT. BUT THAT THAT SORT OF IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION PROCESS MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING IN THERE THAT. WE CAN WORK THROUGH BUT ANYHOW THAT WAS MY QUICK COMMENT. OF ANOTHER ANOTHER QUESTION THAT SENATOR STERN RACISM POINT TWO WITH RESPECT TO CRIMINAL CONDUCT SO IF IF I ACTUALLY SHOT MY CAMPAIGN MANAGER. IN THE CAMPAIGN OFFICE BECAUSE I'M UPSET WITH THE MAIL. THEN I COULD USE CAMPAIGN FUNDS TO DEFEND MYSELF IS THAT IS THAT ACCURATE -- LORD HAVE TO BE. DIRECTLY RELATED. TO SOME POLITICAL AS THEY WERE GOVERNMENTAL PURPOSE -- FORTUNATELY WE HAVEN'T HAD THAT SCENARIO COME UP -- WE'RE NOT GONNA. TO CONTEMPLATING I'M NOT CONTEMPLATING TESTING THAT I WRITE OFFS THIS OR THAT HYPOTHETICAL RIGHT -- AND AND YOU KNOW I THINK THAT -- THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE ON THE CANDIDATES TO JUSTIFY WHY THAT IS A LEGITIMATE USE OF CAMPAIGN FUNDS THAT WOULD -- BE ALLOWED UNDER THE PEEL G. EXCEPTION -- AND AND WHAT WHAT FACTORS THE SCENARIOS WOULD WOULD QUALIFY FOR THAT AND AND MISTER CHAIR I THINK YOU ARE POINTING OUT REALLY THE THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR CAMPAIGN FIND WE CAN WE HAVE VERY BROAD RULES AND A LOT OF BROAD EXCEPTIONS -- AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF POTENTIAL HYPOTHETICALS AND WHAT IFS THAT -- THAT WE GET ASKED ON A ON A YEARLY BASIS THROUGH OUR ADVICE PROCESS -- AND WE HAVE TO MAKE. WE HAVE TO MAKE THESE DETERMINATIONS AND AND THAT IS WHERE THIS BILL REALLY ORIGINATED AS SOMEBODY HAD ASKED WHETHER OR NOT THEY COULD USE CAMPAIGN FUNDS. FOR THIS -- THE FEE HOW RELATED -- UNLAWFUL PRACTICES -- AND OUR COMMISSION VOTED -- THAT THAT IT WASN'T A PERMITTED USE OF OF CAMPAIGN FUNDS -- AND BECAUSE F OUR AGENCIES ACTION THERE IS SOME -- THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME CLARITY IN THE LAW THAT NEEDS TO BE FURTHER DEFINED BY ONE OF THE OTHER BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT AND THAT BEING IN THE LEGISLATURE OR THE COURTS. AND THE COMMISSION -- ONE IN THAT WE COULD BRING LEAVE IT TO THE COURTS WHICH CAN BE UNPREDICTABLE AT TIMES AND SO WE SPONSORED THIS LEGISLATION AND AND WE HOPE THAT WE HAVE YOUR VOTE ULTIMATELY LIMIT LET ME RUN OF SUGGESTION BY BOTH OF YOU -- SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE IS AN ALLEGATION. OF SOME IMPRPRIETY WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A FEE HA. IN THAT PERSON USES CAMPAIGN FUNDS TO DEFEND HERSELF AND THEN AT THE END OF IT IF THERE'S A FINDING OF THE IT'S NOT FOUNDED. THEN THAT PERSON GOES ON THEIR MERRY WAY. IF THERE IS A FINDING -- AND YET TO BE DEFINED FINDING OF SOME SORT OF CULPABILITY. THEN THE PERSON JUST LIKE OTHER VIOLATIONS IS REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE THE CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE AND ALSO RUNS THE RISK OF BEING. IN VIOLATION. WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS WITH RESPONSE TO THAT SUGGESTION? I WOULD JUST IS THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL THAT SOMETHING WE COULD POSSIBLY LOOK AT IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE BECAUSE AS CENTER STERN STATED. THE BILL'S BEEN IN PRINT FOR TWO MONTHS I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING FROM ANYBODY ABOUT THIS BILL THERE STILL IS NO OPPOSITION TO THE BILL UNTIL LATE YESTERDAY AND EARLY THIS MORNING FROM THE GENTLEMAN ON THE THE COMMITTEE HERE SO I AM COMMITTED. TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU MOVING FORWARD. OKAY. MR WRONG WHAT WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT SUGGESTION -- WELL IT CERTAINLY WAS NAME ON THE BILL ULTIMATELY -- AND AND I AS THE SPONSOR WE LEYVA WE I HAVE TO GET BACK TO MY COMMISSION ON ANY SUGGESTION I CAN'T SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE COMMISSION -- AT BUT IT IS IT THIS IS THE FIRST HEARING -- OF OF A LONG LEGISLATIVE CYCLE AND AS ALL OF YOU KNOW NOT ALL BILLS A PERFECT ON THE FIRST GO -- AND SO WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT -- THAT THAT -- CAN BE AMENABLE TO CENTER LEYVA THE COMMISSION AND OF COURSE YOU MISTER CHAIR. CENTER LABOR IN. A TAKE. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE I ASSUME YOU HAVE NO PROBLEM WHEN THE BILL GETS AMEND SHOULD THE BILL BE AMENDED TO TO COMING BACK IF IF WE REQUESTED. PROBABLY NOT DEPENDS ON WHAT THE AMENDMENTS ARE I MEAN I JUST WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR. THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE AS ELECTED OFFICIALS HOLD OURSELVES TO THE STANDARD THAT EVERYONE IN THE PUBLIC IS HELD TO WHEN I RAN MY LOCAL UNION BEFORE I WAS AT BEFORE I RAN FOR OFFICE. IF SOMEONE SUIT CONNIE LEIVA PERSONALLY I COULD NOT USE A LOCAL UNIONS MONEY TO DEFEND MYSELF I WOULD HAVE HAD TO SEE COUNSEL I WOULD HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO PAY FOR THAT. THIS IS NO DIFFERENT THAN THAT AS ELECTED OFFICIALS PEOPLE GIVE US MONEY SO THAT WE CAN GET REELECTED WE CAN DO GOOD WORK IN OUR COMMUNITY THEY DON'T THEY DON'T CONTRIBUTE TO OUR CAMPAIGNS. SO THAT WE CAN COMMIT BAD BEHAVIOR AND THEN USE IT AS A SLUSH FUND TO DEFEND OURSELVES SO. YES I WOULD PROBABLY BE WILLING TO DO THAT BUT I AM JUST VERY COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE TAKING CARE OF THE VICTIMS AND WERE STOPPING BAD BEHAVIOR. WHEN I DID MY RATE BILL TWO YEARS AGO -- ELIMINATE THE STATUE OF LIMITATION ON RAPE THE FIRST COMMITTEE I WENT TO WAS SO WORRIED ABOUT -- WHAT IF SOMEONE GETS FALSELY ACCUSED WELL OF COURSE WE DON'T WANT ANYONE FALSELY ACCUSED BUT WIN TWO OUT OF ONE HUNDRED RAPISTS ARE ACTUALLY CHARGED WE KNEW WE WEREN'T FALSELY IMPRISONING PEOPLE? I SEE THIS BILL IN THE SAME LIGHT THIS IS ALSO A WAY TO DETER PEOPLE RIGHT IF I'M ELECTED MAYBE I'M GONNA THINK TWICE ABOUT SEXUALLY HARASSING. MY STAFFER OR SOMEONE IN THE BUILDING MAYBE I'M NOT GONNA GRAB SOMEONE IF THAT'S WHAT I I DO BECAUSE I KNOW THAT I'M GOING TO BE PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE. SO SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO LEGISLATE FOR THE BAD ACTORS AND UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE SOME BAD ACTORS AMONGST US AS ELECTIVES AND THIS IS JUST SAYING THAT WHEN PEOPLE GIVE YOU THAT MONEY AND TRUST THAT YOU WILL DO THE RIGHT THING WITH THE IN YOUR CAMPAIGN. THAT YOU ACTUALLY WELL SO YES I AM COMMITTED TO WORKING ON IT. BUT I CAN'T SAY YES TO SOMETHING I HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN -- DISCUSSION. ALL RIGHT SIR LEYVA VIEW LIKE CLOTHES OR WAS THAT YOUR CLOTHES THAT WAS MY CLOTHES RIGHTFULLY HOUSE FOR AN AYE VOTE LET'S KEEP WORKING ON THIS TOGETHER. ALL RIGHT.
