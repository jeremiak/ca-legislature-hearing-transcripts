THE UNMET NEEDS OF CHALLENGES TO HOUSING THE HOMELESS. INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR PETS ESPECIALLY DURING EMERGENCIES LIKE COCA NINETEEN PADERA. A PET IS A SOURCE OF COVERAGE STRENGTH AND LOVE FOR SOMEONE STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE. UNFORTUNATELY MOST HOMELESS SHELTERS HAVE NO PET POLICY WHICH IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST BARRIERS THAT KEEP HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AWAY FROM THEIR SHELTERS. LEADING MANY HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS TO REMAIN OUT OF THIS REMAIN OUT IN THE STREETS. AB TWO FIFTY EIGHT WILL REQUIRE ANY STATE FUND FUNDED IN TRUMP HOUSING OR SHELTER. TO FOLLOW THE LOW BARRIER NEXT NAVIGATION CENTER MODEL WHICH WILL WHICH WILL REMOVE BARRIERS TO ENTER. FOR HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AB TWO FIFTY EIGHT WILL ALSO ENCOURAGE SHELTERS TO PARTNER WITH. WITH ANY OTHER LOCAL NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT MAY BE ABLE TO KEEP THE- KEEP. HELPING PROVIDE FOOD AND OTHER VETERINARIAN SERVICES IN ORDER TO SHELTERS THE HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR PATHS pCHRISTOPHER MARTIN WITH POLICY DIRECTOR AND HOMELESS- HOUSING CALIFORNIA AND JILL ANTHONY CRUZ HERE IN THE AUDIENCE. THE DIRECTOR OF- AT THE ANIMAL PROTECTION LEAGUE TO REVISED TESTIMONY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU SOMEONE NUMBER LASSEN MISS ANTHONY IF YOU WANT TO STEP UP TO THE MICROPHONE. AND YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. GOOD AFTERNOON. CHECK TO AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND HOUSING OF THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO FIFTY EIGHT BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER VILLA PUT OFF. MY NAME IS GIANT JEANNIE AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF DEVELOPMENT AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH FOR THE ANIMAL PROTECTION LEAGUE. AND BASED OUT OF STOCKTON CALIFORNIA AND SERVING SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY. I AM HERE TODAY IN FULL SUPPORT OF AB TWO FIFTY EIGHT. THIS BILL WAS WRITTEN AND IS ENDORSED WITH LOVE TEARS AND FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCES FROM WORKING IN THE TRENCHES ALONGSIDE AND HOUSED AND THEIR PETS. IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY IN THE BEGINNING STAGES OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC I WAS INVITED TO COME ASSESS THE CONDITION OF SOME ANIMALS OUT AT THE HOMELESS CAMP. TODAY I HAVE BEEN VISITING THESE CAMPS UP TO FIVE TIMES A WEEK EVERY WEEK. EVERSENSE DURING THIS LAST YEAR THE CONDITIONS I HAVE WITNESSED FOR BOTH PEOPLE AND PETS ARE UTTERLY FORMIDABLE. I HAVE WATCHED THE NUMBER OF HOMES CONTINUE TO GROW RIGHT ALONG WITH THEIR FURRY COMPANIONS. AT A NUMBER THAT DEFIES COMPREHENSION. DESPERATE FOR CHANGE THE ANIMAL PROTECTION LEAGUE AND THE STOCKTON HOMELESS SHELTER AND FUNDED BY THE UNITED WAY AND THE CITY OF STOCKTON. INNER TOGETHER CREATING A PILOT PROGRAM. THIS PILOT PROGRAM ALLOWED THE HOMELESS INDIVIDUAL TO BE ACCOMPANIED BY ONE PET. INTO A LOW BARRIER SHELTER AND THE ANIMAL PROTECTION LEAGUE PROVIDED FOOD. A NEW KENNEL EMBED WE SPAYED AND NEUTERED VACCINATION. AND ANY ADDITIONAL VETERINARY NEEDED. BY THURSDAY AT THE HOMELESS SHELTER. THIS PILOT PROGRAM HAS ENABLED PEOPLE AND THEIR PETS TO BE IN A STABLE ENVIRONMENT. AND IT HAS EVEN OPENED THE DOOR. FOR THE HOMELESS INDIVIDUAL TO SEEK EMPLOYMENT FOR EXAMPLE MY NEW FRIEND VERONICA WAS ABLE TO START HER NEW LIFE BECAUSE OF THE START OF THE PROGRAM. FOR ANNIKA HAS REUNITED WITH HER FAMILY AND SPENDS HER DAY TURNING AND JOB APPLICATIONS. WITH THE PEACE OF MIND THAT HER BELONGINGS ARE NOT BEING STOLEN AND HER DOG ROXY IS SAFE AT HOME. HOW MUCH SHELTERS AND LOCAL ANIMAL NONPROFITS ACROSS THE STATE CAN RECREATE THE SAME OUTCOME. AB TWO FIFTY EIGHT WILL REQUIRE THAT ALL STATE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS. THAT FUND IN TERM. INTERIM HOUSING TO FOLLOW LOW BARRIER HOUSING FIRST PRACTICES WHICH WILL REMOVE THE BARRIERS MANY. HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS FACE WHEN ACCESSING SHELTER. I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER PHILLIP WOULD ROCK. FOR INTRODUCING THIS IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION I PROUDLY SUPPORT AB TWO FIFTY EIGHT. AND I URGE YOUR AYE VOTES THANK YOU. THANK YOU LET'S GO TO THE OPERATOR IF YOU COULD ASK MISTER FOR MISTER CHRIS MARTIN FROM HOUSING CALIFORNIA TO TESTIFY. IN MR MARTIN'S LINE IS OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS CHRISTOPHER MARTIN AND I'M THE POLICY DIRECTOR AT HOUSING CALIFORNIA AN ADVOCACY NONPROFIT FOCUSED ON ENSURING ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO A SAFE STABLE AFFORDABLE PLACE TO CALL HOME. CALIFORNIA IS FACING AN UNPRECEDENTED CRISIS WITH OVER ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN THOUSAND OF WHICH ARE EXPERIENCING UNSHELTERED HOMELESSNESS. TOTALING OVER HALF OF OUR NATION'S UNSHELTERED POPULATION. RESPONDING EFFECTIVELY TO HOMELESSNESS REQUIRES A COMBINATION OF STRATEGY PREVENTING OR DIVERTING PEOPLE FROM EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WHENEVER POSSIBLE ENSURING PEOPLE TRANSITION RAPIDLY FROM HOMELESSNESS TO HOUSING AND SERVICES. AND PROVIDING IMMEDIATE LOW BARRIER SHELTER OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WHO CANNOT IMMEDIATELY ACCESS PERMANENT HOUSING. I'M MERGING TO SHELTER SHOULD SUPPORT FLOW FROM HOUSING CRISIS TO A HOUSING STABILITY. BUT UNFORTUNATELY HIGH BARRIERS TO ENTRY TO EMERGENCY SHELTER OR INTERIM HOUSING PROHIBIT THE FLOW. THROUGH THE SYSTEM AND ACT AS THE SERVICES. I'VE GOT PERCEIVE THAT AN EMERGENCY SAY REQUIRES CONFORMING TO ARBITRARY RULES OR EXPECTATIONS THAT SEEM UNREASONABLE PUNITIVE OR THAT DIVIDE THEM FROM THERE TO FIND FAMILY THEY MADE TO KLEIN SUPPORT THEY THEY URGENTLY NEED. FOR EMERGENCY SHELTER TO ACHIEVE ITS INTENDED PURPOSE OF THE EXPECTATION PLAY THANK GOD SHOULD BE MINIMAL TRANSPARENT AND REASONABLE LOW BARRIER SHELTERS EMPHASIZED WELCOMING GOT IN AS THEY ARE WELL HAVING CLEAR AND SIMPLE BEHAVIORAL EXPECTATIONS THAT APPLY TO ANYONE RESIDING IN THE SHELTER. THESE EXPECTATIONS ARE NARROWLY FOCUSED ON MAINTAINING A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR ALL THIS MODEL IS KNOWN AS THE NAVIGATION CENTER MY- AT THE NAVIGATION. CALLING ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE PETS LIVE WITH A PARTNER STORE THEIR PROPERTY AND COMING UP REALLY IN ADDITION THE CENTER OFFERS ROUND THE CLOCK CASE MANAGEMENT. MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AND CONNECTIONS THE BENEFIT PROGRAMS AND HOUSING ALL IN ONE LOCATION. REQUIRING PARTICIPANTS ARE RECIPIENTS OF STATE FUNDING PROGRAMS TO FOLLOW THE LOW BARRIER MODEL. EIGHTY TWO FIFTY EIGHT WILL CREATE A SYSTEM FOR ALL REGARDLESS OF PRECONDITION AND PROVIDE THEM ACT THAT THE SHELTER ON THEIR WAY TOWARDS FINDING STABILITY IN PERMANENT HOUSING. WE WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR PROPOSING THIS CRITICAL LEGISLATION WHICH HOUSING CALIFORNIA IS PROUD OF THE POOR AND WE ARE JOB. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THERE ARE NO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION SO LET'S GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT. TO THE OPERATOR IF YOU COULD PLEASE OPEN UP THE LINES FOR INDIVIDUALS.

THE OPPORTUNITY TESTIFIED AB FIVE SEVENTY ONE- THIS LEGISLATION IS JUST ONE SMALL PIECE IN A LARGER PUSH TO MAKE HOUSING MORE AFFORDABLE IN CALIFORNIA. IMPACT AND DEVELOPMENT FEES SIGNIFICANT EFFECT THE OVERALL COST OF THE PROJECT AND ARE OFTEN PASSED ALONG TO BUYERS IN THE FORM OF HIGHER- HOME PRICES. HOWEVER WHEN THESE FEES ARE REQUIRED FOR AFFORDABLE BONUS LAWS THE ENTIRE COST OF THE PROJECT GOES UP UNLESS AFFORDABLE HOUSING GETS BUILT. THAT IS WHY MY LEGISLATION SIMPLY PROHIBITS IMPOSING CERTAIN FEES FOR DEED RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE UNITS IT SIMPLY DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO DISINCENTIVE THE CONSTRUCTION OF DEED RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE UNITS WITHIN A DENSITY BONUS APPLICATION AS WE SEEK TO ENCOURAGE DEVELOPERS. TO MAXIMIZE AFFORDABLE UNITS. I WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE JENNIFER'S BACK WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION REALTORS TO TESTIFY SUPPORT.

EIGHTY FIVE SEVENTY ONE SIX TO CREATE MORE UNITS OF NATURALLY OCCURRING AFFORDABLE MARKET RATE HOUSING WHILE ALSO SEEKING TO INCREASE AND MAXIMIZE THE NUMBER OF DEED RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE UNITS. CONTAINED WITHIN A DENSITY BONUS APPLICATIONS BY REMOVING THE DEFINITIVE FEES PLACED ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS CONTAINED WITHIN APPLICATION DEVELOPERS CAN MAXIMIZE THE TOTAL NUMBER. OF UNITS THAT THEY ARE DEVELOPING. IT'S SIMPLY THE MAKE SENSE OR FOR HOUSING FUND HOW IF WE WILL AMERICA THE NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE UNITS CONSTRUCTED. AND MIXED INCOME DENSITY BONUS PROJECTS. ARE MOVING OF PEOPLE COULD BE WILL OF THE FROM THE RIGHT DIRECTION AS WE SPEAK TO ENACT POLICIES. TO HELP US SOLVE OUR STATE PERSISTENT CONTINUING HOUSING CRISIS.

AND WITH THAT WHEN WE GO TO OUR NEXT ITEM FILE ITEM FOURTEEN AB EIGHT THIRTY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO I READ AN ARTICLE IN A LATEST. ABOUT SOME CHILDREN WHO HAD DIED IN A IN A FIRE IN AN APARTMENT BUILDING. AND THE REASON THERE WAS A FIRE IS BECAUSE THE APARTMENT COMPLEX. WAS REALLY IN AGREE JUST CONDITION SUB HABITABLE. AND DIDN'T HAVE HE TOO DIDN'T HAVE- IT HAD A LOT OF DR- DRY ROT AND MOLD BLACK MOLD IN THE BUILDING IT WAS IT WAS A SLUM. AND THE REASON THAT THIS BUILDING WAS ALLOWED TO CONTINUE LIKE THIS IS BECAUSE THE CODE ENFORCEMENT ENTITY IN THIS PARTICULAR CITY. REFUSED TO GO INSPECT WERE IN FORCE. ON THE LANDLORD BECAUSE THEY HAD SET UP A WHOLE BUNCH OF CRITERIA THAT THE TENANTS HAD TO GO THROUGH INTO THEIR ORDINANCE IN ORDER TO GET THE CODE ENFORCEMENT. THE TENANTS FOR INSTANCE HAD TO BE UP ON THEIR RENT EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A SUB HABITABLE BUILDING. SOME OF THE TENANTS RUN DOCUMENTED THEY WERE AFRAID PROBABLY THREATENED BY THE LANDLORD OF BEING EVICTED OR TURNED OVER TO ICE IF THEY WERE TO COMPLAIN. WELL I WAS REALLY SHOCKED I MEAN BUT IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT MY CITY'S CODE ENFORCEMENT ACTUALLY. TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE BUILDINGS WERE HABITABLE REGARDLESS OF THE TENANTS OF THE STATUS OF THE TENANTS. I FOUND OUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE ACROSS CALIFORNIA. AND AB EIGHT THIRTY EIGHT SIX TO CHANGE THAT AN IT SAYS SIMPLY THAT CODE ENFORCEMENT IN LOCALITIES NEED TO ENFORCE. NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE BUILDINGS IN THEIR DISTRICTS ARE MEET BASIC SAFETY AND HEALTH STANDARDS. THAT'S WHAT THE BILL DOES IT'S EXTREMELY EXTREMELY SIMPLE BUT VERY IMPORTANT FOR VULNERABLE TENANTS. WHO ARE OTHERWISE- IT TIMES AFRAID TO GO DIRECTLY TO LANDLORDS THEY SHOULD HAVE ANOTHER OUT. IF THEY'RE SCARED OF THEIR LANDLORD THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO TO A CITY AND SAY. MY BUILDING DOESN'T. HAVE RUNNING WATER DOESN'T HAVE HEAT. PLEASE MAKE THE LAND BRING THIS BUILDING UP TO CODE. I WITH THAT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND I THINK THAT WE DO HAVE. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT- FROM WE HAVE CYNTHIA CALVILLO FROM THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND BRIAN ACOSTA FROM CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION. THANK YOU MISTER JONES.

PROBABLY REASONS WE ARE JUST A PART OF TEMPLE YET MEANINGFUL BELL THANK. GIVEN THEM ACIDIC RIGHT TO ENFORCE THOSE AND THE AUTHOR MENTIONED AN EXAMPLE OUT OF LOS ANGELES BUT IN RURAL COMMUNITIES AS WELL WE FACE THE SAME PROBLEMS- OFTEN SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS WITH INCONSISTENT ENFORCEMENT AND OTHER BARRIERS AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT YOU HAVE POLICIES SUCH AS THE ONE THAT THIS BILL WOULD ADDRESS WHICH PREVENT ENFORCEMENT WITH MODELS LIKE WE DON'T EXPECT WE DON'T IN FACT IF THERE'S AN AFFECTION CASE PENDING OR WE DON'T ENFORCE THAT THE RENTS HASN'T BEEN PAID WE DON'T INSPECT SECTION EIGHT UNITS. ALL OF THOSE DIRECTLY FRUSTRATE THE PROTECTIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS ENACTED TO ENSURE THAT TENANTS CAN ACCESS THOSE RIGHTS IN THE RESULT IS TENANTS FORCED TO LIVE IN DANGEROUS AND SUBSTANDARD CONDITIONS WERE UNABLE TO GET JUST A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE GOVERNMENT TO CALM AN INSPECTOR WHO IS TASKED WITH PROTECTING THE PUBLIC AND MAKE A BASIC INSPECTION AND DOCUMENT THE PROBLEM THAT THAT LEAVES THEM VULNERABLE BOTH TO UNSAFE CONDITIONS BUT ALSO.

WE ARE BRING IT UP THERE NEVER DO ANYTHING ABOUT THEIR NEVER FIX IT YOU KNOW AND- THE EVENT OF THE DAY THERE ARE THERE BASICS THE IDEA SOMEHOW PEOPLE WERE TO GO TO THEIR LOCAL ENFORCEMENT AGE AS A DESK FOR THEM THEY GO BECAUSE IT'S A LAST RESORT BECAUSE THERE ISSUES HAVEN'T DEALT WITH I GET THOSE THAT ARE LANDLORDS. YOU KNOW THAT YOU LOOK MY FAMILY HAS BEEN DOZEN PROP RENTAL HOMES SECTION EIGHT WE'VE NEVER HAD ANY CONTRA THE LOCAL% ENFORCERS BECAUSE WE KEEP PROPERTY TO BREAK CONDITION THIS ISSUE THE FIRST IMMEDIATELY THE DALLAS THE KIND OF WHY WOULD YOU WANT. THE NO ONE'S GONNA BE FEEL THE NEED TO GO REAL IS THAT THERE. THERE ARE THERE ABOUT ACTORS AND I GET THAT GOOD I SOMETIMES HAVE TO HAVE A- BURDENS PLACE ON THEMSELVES BUT OF THE BAD. BUT REALITY THAT WHEN IT COMES TO SOME HOME SOMEONE'S HOME. WE HAVE HAVE STANDARDS PLACE. THAT ALLOW THEM TO THE BILL. HEALTH AND SAFETY IS. THAT THAT ARE LOW GOVERNMENTS HAD RESPONSE TO AND IN THE- SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SHOW UP ON THEIR RENT THEY SHOULD THE SHORT THING SAID FIVE NOTE. TO THE REALITY IS THAT SEPARATE FROM THE STANDARDS BY BE UP AND SO. I APPRECIATE- APPRECIATE THIS AND WAS. BOTH LIKE THEM AT THIS TIME. ALL OF THE REFORMS. FIVE YEARS MARKETABILITY TO CALL THAT GOES ON INSIDE HERE TO READ- HIGH- OF- RIGHT WANTED TO IN PARTICULAR- HOUSE ACTUALLY GOT BURNED OUT OF THE GROUND. THEY WOULD READ BRAND NEW FROM THE GROUND UP AND WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF THE FOR CONDITION AGAIN NOT EVEN IF IT BECAME AVAILABLE. RUBIO AND YEAH AND THERE IS TALK. DAGAN SO I HAD A FRONT ROW SEAT IN AREAS WHERE- AND BASICALLY YOU HAVE SLUMLORDS. AND THOSE ARE DEPLORABLE CONDITIONS AND THE HOUSING AUTHORITY IN THE CITY THAT I'VE WORKED IN- THEY DID GO HANDLE THOSE- BUT HE HE THE MORE IT SEEMS WE SHIFT ALL THE RESPONSIBILITY ON TO THE LANDLORD- I THINK. THE MORE WE SEE WE HAVE THE IRRESPONSIBLE TENET SIDE OF THIS. SO YOU KNOW YOU AT NIGHT I STRUGGLE WITH THESE- BECAUSE I KNOW BOTH SIDES AND- I JUST I JUST WISH WE WOULD NOT CONTINUE TO PAINT LANDLORDS IS THE BAD GUYS AND ALL THESE BECAUSE I HAVE BELIEVE ME THERE'S PLENTY OF SHARED RESPONSIBILITY. AND UNLESS THIS BILL WOULD WOULD HELP DISCERN WHO IS ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDITION OF THE PROPERTY AND HOLD THEM RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT NOT JUST THE LANDLORD AND IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SUPPORT IT SOME OF. MY COMMENTS THANK. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR YOUR CONTINUED WORK ON THIS ISSUE I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT EVERYONE DESERVES A HOME THAT'S SAFE AND FREE FROM HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS AND AS SOMEONE WHO HAS HARPER LEGISLATION TO TACKLE THE PAIN HAZARDS IN OUR STATES HOMES ARE UNHAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND LOOK FORWARD TO. SEEING IT MOVE THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND WITHOUT ANY FINAL COMMENTS SURE- JUST A QUICK RESPONSE MISTER SEA ARE TOO I APPRECIATE THE COMMENT- AND MAYBE YOU WERE REFERRING TO A DIFFERENT BILL BECAUSE THIS BILL DOESN'T PUT ANY NEW WHATSOEVER THIS BILL ACTUALLY PUTS A RESPONSIBILITY ON MUNICIPALITIES TO DO INSPECTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CURRENT RESPONSIBILITIES THAT LANDLORDS ALL HAVE TO PROVIDE A HABITABLE RESIDENTS IS BEING DONE RATHER THAN TELLING TENANTS I'M SORRY WE WON'T ENFORCE WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO AND INSPECT. BECAUSE WE DON'T LIKE YOU THAT'S WHAT IF YOU HAVE A SAFETY RECALL ON YOUR CAR ALLOWING A CAR COMPANY TO SAVE YOU WE DON'T HAVE TO GIVE YOU A RECALL BECAUSE YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT ARREARS ON YOUR PAYMENT. YOU HAVE WE SHOULD EXPECT OUR LANDLORDS TO PROVIDE WHAT'S ALREADY UNDER THE LAW OF THE HABITABILITY WHO'S RESPONSIBLE THAT'S WE DON'T CHANGE ANY OF THAT BURDEN THEY CAN ALWAYS GO TO ATTEND IF THEY THINK OF TIME AS DAMAGE SOMETHING BUT IT'S INCONCEIVABLE TO ME THAT WE HAVE CITIES VERY FEW BUT WE HAVE A FEW CITIES IN THE STATES THAT ARE REFUSING TO DO CODE ENFORCEMENT BUT REFUSING TO DO INSPECTIONS. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS A BILL BILLS ABOUT CHANGES NOTHING FOR LANDLORDS WHATSOEVER IT CHANGES A RESPONSIBILITY OF MUNICIPALITIES AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE HAD CHILDREN DIE IN THE STATE AND I'M HAPPY TO SHOW YOU THE ARTICLE BECAUSE THE CITY REFUSED TO GO TO THOSE SLUMLORDS AND HAVE THEM IN FORCE AND SAID THEY TOLD THE TENANTS BUT THEY WERE BEHIND ON THE RENT AND SO IT WAS ALL UP TO THEM TO LIVE A CERTAIN WAY AND CHILDREN DIED BECAUSE OF THAT. AND WITH THAT I WOULD REQUEST AN AYE VOTE TO PROTECT. OUR VULNERABLE TENANTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU WITHOUT MODEM SO. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTION TO PASS TO THE CAN APPROPRIATIONS TROOPS OUR QUEUE I SAY ARE DON'T KNOW YEAH NO GABRIELLE. GABRIEL I KALRA. KALRA KILEY. HIGHLY NO MAIENSCHEIN CORK SILVA HI FOLKS SILVA I WEEKS WEEKS I.

ANAHEIM MISTER BLASIER INTELLIGENCE- I KNOW YOU'VE NEVER BILLS TO PRESENT AND SHE HAS ONCE APPRECIATE YOU ALLOWING HER TO PRESENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING MASKS. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT SB EIGHT EIGHTY LEGISLATION TO SPEED AFFORDABLE HOME RECONSTRUCTION IN THE WAKE OF A DECLARED EMERGENCY. CALIFORNIA'S RECENT NATURAL DISASTERS HAVE DEVASTATED COMMUNITIES AND THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED THROUGH THE MANY OF WHO WE ARE STILL REBUILDING THEIR LIVELIHOOD HOMES AND LIVES. THE WILDFIRES OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THE STORY TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND HOMES IN THE COUNTIES OF BUTTE. COLUSA GLENN LAKE MENDOCINO NAPA SANTA BARBARA SHASTA CINEMA TRINITY IN VENTURA. THE DEADLY CAMPFIRE ALONE DESTROYED THE ENTIRE TOWN OF PARADISE NEARLY FOURTEEN THOUSAND HOMES KILLED EIGHTY FIVE PEOPLE IT WAS THE DEADLIEST FIRE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. FIVE OF THE SIX BIGGEST FIRES IN TOTAL ACREAGE OCCURRED IN TWENTY TWENTY WITH THE LOSS OF TEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED STRUCTURES AND MORE THAN THIRTY LIVES. FEDERAL DISASTER FUNDING TRADITIONALLY THE MAJOR SOURCE OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR NATURAL DISASTERS IS INSUFFICIENT AND TAKES YEARS TO OBTAIN. IT TOOK NEARLY TWO YEARS AFTER THE DISASTERS FOR HUD TO SIGN OFF ON ANY OF THE STATE'S PROPOSALS TO RESPOND TO THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WILDFIRES. AND HE WAS FOUR YEARS BEFORE THE FUNDS WERE DEPLOYED AS A RESULT RECOVERY HAS BEEN SLOW AND THOSE MOST IN NEED NEED OF HELP DO NOT GET IT TO LONG AFTER THE DISASTER. AB EIGHT EIGHTY WHAT ESTABLISH THE AFFORDABLE DISASTER HOUSING REVOLVING DEVELOPMENT AND ACQUISITION PROGRAM. THE FUNDED OF PRE DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES- ACQUISITION CONSTRUCTION RECONSTRUCTION AND REHABILITATION PROPERTY TO DEVELOPER PRESERVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE STATE'S. FEDERALLY DECLARED DISASTER AREAS THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED DAMAGE AND LOSS OF HOMES OCCUPIED BY FIVE OR AFFECTING LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. THE BILL WOULD ALLOW COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO APPLY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FOR FUNDING TO MAKE SHORT TERM LOANS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ANDCONSUMERS. THE FUNDS COULD BE USED FOR A VARIETY OF HOUSING RELATED POST DISASTER RECOVERY EFFORTS INCLUDING ACQUISITION REHABILITATION AND NEW CONSTRUCTION. THE SHORT TERM LOANS WOULD BE REPAID THROUGH THE FEDERAL DISASTER RECOVERY FUNDING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRE BUT THE APPROVED PLAN OF ACTION. WITH ME TODAY VIRTUALLY TO PROVIDE THEIR TESTIMONY OUR SHAUNA OF SHAUGHNESSY WITH THE PRESIDENCY OF THE COMMUNITY HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES CROP COOPER OXEA CORPORATION. IN MARION MCFADDEN. OF FROM ENTERPRISE COMMUNITY PARTNERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WHAT'S GOOD HERE WITNESSES PALOOZA BILL. IF WE GO TO THE OPERATOR TO A- SEAN O'SHAUGHNESSY OR MARY MCFADDEN. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRED THE MEMBERS MY NAME IS SEAN O'SHAUGHNESSY AND I AM THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF COMMUNITY HOUSING IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS ARE BEING CUTE SHASTA CAME OUT GLENN COLUSA BETTER IN YUBA COUNTY IN OTHER WORDS MANY OF THE COUNTIES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY DEVASTATING WILDFIRES MOST NOTABLY THE CAMPFIRE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. OUR REGION HAS BEEN ON THE EDGE OF THE HOUSING CRISIS FOR MANY YEARS THE WILDFIRES HAVE ELIMINATED FIRST. IF YOU COUNTY WE STILL HAVE OVER SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOUSEHOLD IN ACTIVE DISASTER CASE MANAGEMENT. AND NEARLY ONE THOUSAND ON THE WAITLIST NINETY SEVEN HOUSEHOLDS ARE STILL ON SCENE AT THE STATE HOUSING. OUR HOMELESS POPULATION IS EXPLODING. THE BIGGEST BARRIER TO RECOVERY IS OUR LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AB EIGHT EIGHT EIGHTY COULD HELP PREVENT OTHER COMMUNITIES FROM EXPERIENCING THE SAME DEGREE OF LONG TERM DISPLACEMENT AND DISRUPTION. IT'S SUCH A LONG FUND HAD EXISTED MY ORGANIZATIONS COMMUNITY HOUSING IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM COULD IT STARTED THE RECONSTRUCTION OF OUR MULTI FAMILY PROJECT PARADISE COMMUNITY VILLAGE. A YEAR SOONER WHILE WE ARE ON TRACK TO FINISH THIS AUGUST IMAGINE THE IMPACT IF WE COULD HAVE FINISHED SOONER. NONE OF THE OTHER AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT IN PARADISE HAVE STARTED REBUILDING AT MOST DIDN'T STRUGGLING TO FIND FUNDING AND WE DON'T EXPECT TO SEE CDBG DR DOLLARS. UNTIL THE END OF THIS YEAR OR EARLY NEXT. THIS COULD HELPED ME HOME IN INCOME. START ON PATH TO RECONSTRUCTION. NOW THREE YEARS LATER IF THEY SPEND THEIR INSURANCE MONEY ON RENT OR OTHER ESSENTIALS. CDBG DR WON'T COVER THAT GAP THE BAND STARTED REBUILDING RIGHT AWAY WHICH EIGHTY EIGHT EIGHTY WOULD ALLOW THIS WILL NOT EVEN BE AN ISSUE. IT IS MY DEEP DESIRE THAT NO OTHER DEVELOPER HAVE TO STRUGGLE LIKE WE DID TO REBUILD PARETEUM IN THE VILLAGE. AND THAT THAT DISASTER IMPACTED INDIVIDUALS DON'T HAVE TO WAIT YEARS FOR THE RESTORATION OF THEIR HOME THEIR LIVES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. AB EIGHT EIGHTY IS THE FIRST STEP IN MAKING A QUICKER RECOVERY POSSIBLE THANK YOU. FIRMAS MCFAYDEN PLEASE. AFTERNOON AMEREN EXPANDABLE AND APPRISE COMMITTEE PARTNERS SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHT EIGHTY CENTER PROJECT WORK BECAUSE AFTER IMPACT IN COMMUNITIES FROM CALIFORNIA PORTER RICO I PREVIOUSLY ADMINISTERED HOW DISASTER RECOVERY PROGRAM FOR FIFTEEN YEARS THE THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE LEARNED THE SPEED OF FEDERAL DISASTER PROGRAMS IS PAINFULLY SLOW EVEN WHEN CONGRESS ACTS QUICKLY T APPROPRIATE MONEY- ON AVERAGE IT TAKES JURISDICTIONS MORE THAN EIGHTEEN MONTHS AFTER DISASTER TO STAND UP THERE HOUSING RECOVERY PROGRAMS. AND IN LARGE PART THAT'S BECAUSE THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENT AS YOU HEARD AFTER THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN FIRES THAT TOOK HARD TWO YEARS AFTER CONGRESSMAN THE FUNDING AVAILABLE TO SET RULES FOR THE RECOVERY PROGRAM AND APPROVED CALIFORNIA'S PLAN AND IN THE MEANTIME HOUSING REBUILDING STALLED. ST NEW EXACTLY HOW MUCH FEDERAL GRANT FUNDING WAS COMING BUT COULDN'T SUPPORT REBUILDING CALIFORNIA CAN'T MAKE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MOVE MORE QUICKLY BUT YOU HAVE THE POWER TO START REBUILDING IN A MORE TIMELY MANNER EIGHTY EIGHT EIGHTY WOULD CONSIDERABLY SHORTEN THE TIME BETWEEN DISASTER AND RECOVERY BY ENABLING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO MAKE SHORT TERM LOANS ON GOOD TERMS AND CONDITIONS. FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND CONSUMERS. FIND WILL BE USED TO WITH. AND BRIDGE THAT TIME AND TELL TEAM UNDER OTHER GRANTS CAN BE USED TO PAY THE LOAN OFF. THE REPAID FUNDS WILL THEN BE REVOLVED INTO NEW BRAKES ON. TWENTY TWENTY BROKE ALL RECORDS FOR WILDFIRE DAMAGE WITH MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND STRUCTURES DESTROYED OR DAMAGED. THE STATE AND LIKELY TO SEE MUCH MORE DAMAGE TO THE INCREASING IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE SO I RECOMMEND PASSAGE OF EIGHT EIGHTY SEVEN INNOVATIVE AND ARREST WAY TO SHORTEN THE TIME BETWEEN DISASTER RECOVERY FOR IMPACTED CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU.

IT PROBABLY MAKES SENSE FOR ME TO START WITH- FILE ORDER THREE GO THROUGH A THREE FOUR AND FIVE AND THEN COME BACK TO SOUNDS GOOD FILE IN THREE AB SEVEN TWENTY ONE BLOWN. THANK YOU TO THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WILL START OFF BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY THE ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THAT. AB SEVEN TWENTY ONE WILL INVALIDATE DENSITY RESTRICTIONS AND PRIVATE PROVIDENCE THAT CONFLICT WITH LOCAL ZONING. AND MAKE THEM UNAFFORDABLE AGAINST IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING pSOMEONE ON THE LINE IF YOU COULD PLEASE GIVE YOURSELF. THANK YOU ESTABA PRIVATE COVENANTS OR AGREEMENTS ATTACHED TO A PROPERTY AND REMAIN UNENFORCEABLE EXCUSE ME REMAIN ENFORCEABLE EVEN AFTER THE PROPERTY IS SOLD. UNTIL THE MID TWENTIETH CENTURY RACIALLY RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS WERE USED AS A TOOL TO SEGREGATE NEIGHBORHOODS AND BAR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. COURT DECISIONS IN THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAVE MADE THESE RACIALLY RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS ENFORCEABLE FORTUNATELY HOWEVER THESE COVENANTS OFTEN CONTAIN OTHER VESTIGES OF DISCRIMINATION SUCH AS LIMITS ON THE NUMBER AND SIZES OF UNITS THAT CAN BUILD THAT CAN BE BUILT. THESE DENSITY RESTRICTIONS ALSO CONFLICT WITH LOCAL ZONING CODES THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR MULTI FAMILY HOUSING DEVELOPMENT YET DESPITE THEIR DISCRIMINATORY ORIGIN AND CLEAR CONFLICT WITH CURRENT LOCAL ZONING. THESE RESTRICTIONS REMAIN ENFORCEABLE AGAINST IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER. THREATS OF LAWSUITS OVER THESE COVENANTS MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS TO GET TITLE INSURANCE COVERAGE AND FUNDING FROM LENDERS THE TIME AND EXPENSE NEEDED TO REMOVE THE COVENANTS DETER DEVELOPERS FROM ACQUIRING AND DEVELOPING ON THESE OTHERWISE. IDEAL PROJECT SITES AB SEVEN TWENTY ONE WILL ENSURE THAT THESE PRIVATE COVENANTS CANNOT BE USED TO CURTAIL MUCH NEEDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING THIS MEASURE CLARIFIES THAT DENSITY RESTRICTIONS IN PRIVATE COVENANTS ARE UNENFORCEABLE AGAINST A 1100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. AB SEVEN TWENTY ONE WILL HELP BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE UNITS WHILE PRESERVING AND STRENGTHENING LOCAL CONTROL. LASTLY THERE BEEN SOME CONCERNS OVER THE MODIFICATION DOCUMENT PROCEDURES LAID OUT IN THE BILL AND I APPRECIATE RECEIVING FEEDBACK REGARDING THE LANGUAGE FROM THE LAND TITLE ASSOCIATION AND THE COUNTY RECORDER'S I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING ON AMENDMENTS IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE TO PROVIDE MORE CLARITY ON THOSE ISSUES. CALLING IN TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT ARE BRANDON PAY AT WITH PUBLIC COUNCIL AND TERRIBLE ROSTERS WITH THE COMMUNITY CORPORATION OF SANTA MONICA THANK YOU THANK YOU WITHOUT TO THE OPERATOR IF YOU COULD PLEASE ALLOW. EITHER OF THE WITNESSES TO SPEAK AT THIS TIME. BOTH BUT DEADLINES ARE OPEN. MS BROSQUE THIS. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR NUMBERS MY NAME IS HARPER OUT AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY CORPORATE SANTA MONICA WHERE MIDSIZE NONPROFIT THAT IS OPERATED AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE AFFLUENT WEBSITE L. A. COUNTY FOR ALMOST FORTY YEARS I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING ASSEMBLYMEMBER RICHARD BLOOM FOR CHAMPIONING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND OFFERING TO SELL WE'RE HERE TODAY THE CO SPONSORED EIGHTY SEVEN TWENTY ONE BECAUSE OF THE PORTABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS WE BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT TO SHARE WITH POLICYMAKERS THE OBSTACLES WE FACE. IN HOPES THEY CAN BEAT THAT THE ISSUES RAISED BY EIGHTY SEVEN TWENTY ONE ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY ADDRESS HISTORICAL SEGREGATION IN NEIGHBORHOODS AS AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER I THINK RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS WITH EXTREMELY DISTURBING PROVISIONS ALONG WITH ACCOMPANYING DENSITY RESTRICTIONS THE MULTIPLE CAR USUALLY HAVE CHOSEN TO WALK AWAY FROM THIS PROJECT BUT AFTER THE EVENTS OF THE PAST YEAR I FEEL IT'S IMPORTANT TO CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO AND TAKE AWAY THE POWER THAT THE SEGREGATIONIST COVENANTS THAT HAD. THREE MOPEDS COVENANT WILL COST A LOT OF MONEY IN AN EXTENDED QUARTER PROFIT AND FOR PROPERTIES ALREADY UNDER DESIGNATED MULTI FAMILY BY THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT IN ONE PROJECT WE'RE WORKING ON THE PROPERTY IS DESIGNATED MULTI FAMILY BY THE CITY AND THE ONLY THING STANDING IN THE WAY IT IS PRIVATE OUTDATED COVENANT AMONG DONORS FROM THE NINETEEN FORTIES. IT WOULD PROVIDE OVER A HUNDRED UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN AN AFFLUENT COMMUNITY THAT HAS CURRENTLY NO AFFORDABLE HOUSING OTHER PROJECTS HAVE FACED SIMILAR ISSUES WE KEEP WE APPRECIATE OUR CO SPONSOR PUBLIC COUNCIL WHO WILL EXPLAIN MORE ABOUT THE COVENANT WE CANNOT BEGIN TO ADDRESS EXCLUSIONARY NEIGHBORHOODS WITHOUT A DRAFTING RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS WE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AS A STEP TOWARD ENDING. DESEGREGATION OF. THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO THE PUB COUNCIL WITNESS. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS FIND RENDON PAT I'M THE STAFF OF WITH PUBLIC COUNT THE NATION'S LARGE PROBLEM LOS AND MY WORK FOCUSES AND ON A HOW IN THE TO NOW TO FIRST THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE CARE ATTENTION TO THE HOUSING PRACTICE HEARING. EIGHTY SEVEN TWENTY ONE IS DESIGNED TO CONTINUE THE FIGHT TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS AND HELP REMEDY THE HISTORICAL HARMS THAT DISCRIMINATORY HOUSING POLICIES A PAT ON LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. OF COVERAGE HAVE ON MANY. MANY PEOPLE ARE. WITH THE HISTORY OF RACIALLY RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS THAT WERE DESIGNED TO PROHIBIT PEOPLE OF COLOR FROM LIVING AN ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD. UNFORTUNATELY THE LEGACY OF THOSE RESTRICTIONS. THOSE RACIST RESTRICTIONS LET'S NOT AND- RECORDED RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT DEVELOPMENT ON A GIVEN PARCEL TO A CERTAIN NUMBER OF RESIDENTIAL NITS OR TO A CERTAIN NUMBER OF BUILDINGS. ARE OFTEN TREATED AS ENFORCEABLE TODAY EVEN IF THOSE RESTRICTIONS ARE MORE LIMITING THAN THE APPLICABLES OWN CODE. AND USE RULES. AND EVEN IF THOSE RESTRICTIONS ARE CONTAINED IN THE SAME EXACT DOCUMENT. AS EXPLICITLY RACIST RESTRICTIONS ON WHO MAY LIVE THAT. EIGHTY SEVEN TWENTY ONE TO MAKE THE PRIVATE DENSITY RESTRICTIONS IN RECORDED COVENANTS UNENFORCEABLE AGAINST A 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. THEREBY REMOVING A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF A HOUSING FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE IN NEIGHBORHOODS THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY EXCLUDED THEM. EMPLOYER IMPORTANTLY THE BILL WOULD NOT MAKE NOTE WOULD REQUIRE ANY CHANGES LOCAL ZONING CODES ONE NINETEEN S. RULES. IT WOULD SIMPLY ALLOW A PROPERTY OWNER TO BUILD AS MUCH AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON A GIVEN PROPERTY AS THE APPLICABLES OWN CODE WOULD ALLOW. ADDITIONALLY THE BILL DOES NOT DO WAY WITH RESTRICTIVE COVENANT ENTIRELY. ANY RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF PROPERTY NOT RELATED TO THE SIZE LOCATION OR NUMBER OF RESIDENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS. WOULD REMAIN FULLY ENFORCEABLE. AND EIGHTY SEVEN TWENTY ONE EXPLICITLY ALLOWS THE LOCAL COMMUNITY TO RETAIN ITS CHARACTER BY ENFORCING DESIGN AND ATHLETIC RESTRICTION.

OUR MOTION WITH THE BILL FOR THE MOTION IS A MOTION FOR MISTER KILEY. JUST UNDERSTAND THAT IND OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THIS ARISES SO- IF I OWNED A LARGE ATTRACTIVE PROPERTY AND THEN ONE TO SELL OFF PART OF IT- BUT WANTED TO YOU KNOW ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH A BUYER AT TO RESTRICT THE LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT. ON THAT PARCEL IS YOUR BILL STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING OR ALLOW THE OWNER TO THEN GO BACK IN IN A RACE THAT RESTRICTION NOTICE UP LIES ONLY PROJECTS. THE PRESUMABLY IF THAT PARCEL WERE USED FOR THAT PURPOSE THAN THE INITIAL AGREEMENT WOULDN'T HOLD OR IS. THAT NOT THE SORT OF SITUATION THAT IS LIKELY TO COME UP. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LANGUAGE IN THE DEED IS A VESTIGE OF THIS- ORIGINALS- RESTRICTIVE COVENANT LANGUAGE- IT WOULD NOT BE EFFECTIVE BUT- PERHAPS WE SHOULD ASK- MS BROSQUE US. TO FURTHER ANSWER THAT QUESTION. RIGHT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I DON'T THINK- ACT I THINK IF THERE WAS A RESTRICTIVE COVENANT BANK WASRECORDED THAT WOULD NOT ALLOW- AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE THE DENSITY RESTRICTIONS THIS WAY- A FAX FAX BUT I THINK- THE LIKELIHOOD AS I MEAN I THINK THERE IS A QUESTION REGARDING CREATING A NEW COVENANT OR AN EXISTING. RIGHT CREATING A NEW COMPANY. I MEAN IT WOULDN'T MATTER TO INTO THE LAND OF THE BILL IT'S EXISTING OR NEW. THANK YEAH WHAT COUNCIL CAN HELP AND STRUGGLING IT'S ACTING ON HOW TO ANSWER THE QUESTION. HI YEAH THIS IS BRANDON PAYER CAN PUBLIC PUBLIC AND THEN THANKS FOR THE IMPORTANT QUESTION- SO THE WAY THAT- WE WOULD ENVISION THAT SCENARIO THAT YOU DESCRIBED IS- YOU'RE STILL FULLY ABLE TO CONTRACT INDIVIDUALLY WITH- THE PERSON THAT YOU'RE SELLING A PROPERTY TO- AND THAT AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND THAT THAT. BUYER WOULD BE ENFORCEABLE- BUT EIGHTY SEVEN TWENTY ONE WOULD MAKE A CHANGE WHERE- IF- SOME YEARS FROM NOW- ANOTHER BUYER WHERE WE'RE PURCHASING THE PROPERTY- THAT THAT WOULD. NECESSARILY BE INCOMPATIBLE AGAIN- OKAY THAT'S WHAT I AM I WAS KIND OF GETTING OUT SO IT DOESN'T THEN RUN WITH THE LAND SO TO SPEAK- AND- YOUR ABILITY IS THE SELLER TO SORT OF- LIMIT. ACTIVITY ON THE ADJACENT OR SOMEWHERE WHEREVER THAT PARCEL MAY BE A KIND OF STOPS WITH THE- THE IMMEDIATE FIRE IS THAT RIGHT. RIGHT AND THAT IS THE I MEAN YOU COULD AGAIN YOU'D BE ABLE TO MAKE AN AGREEMENT WITH THE NEW WITH THE NEW BUYER OF COURSE AND AGAIN THIS IS ONLY APPLICABLE TO A AGAIN ONLY APPLICABLES IN A SCENARIO WHERE THE PROPERTY IS ALREADY ZONED FOR WHATEVER PARTICULAR DEVELOPMENT WE'RE GOING TO BE HAPPENING ON THAT PROPERTY- BUT YES THAT THE AGREEMENT WOULD HAVE TO BE PERSONAL. AND- IT WOULD BE IDEAS JUST GIVING THOSE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS- CONTROL OVER OVER LONG TERM DEVELOPMENT DECISION. RATHER THAN DEVELOPERS FROM TRUMP. YEAH PERHAPS DECADES THERE ARE EVEN MORE. RIGHT OKAY THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR MOVING THIS FORWARD I THINK WE'RE ALL AWARE THAT- RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS HAVE HAD A LONG HISTORY IN OUR STATE OR COUNTRY WITHIN EXCLUSIONARY IMPACT. MOST NOTABLY- IMPACTING THE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR BUT- THEY HAVE ALSO HAD OTHER IMPACTS AS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE ANALYSIS WITH REGARDS TO THIS BILL. I THINK THIS BILL DOES ADDRESS AN IMPORTANT BARRIER TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION BY. ESTABLISHING THIS PROCESS TO REMOVE THESE RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS. DO APPRECIATE THAT THE CALIFORNIA TITLE SITUATION AND OTHERS HAVE RECEIVED HAVE RISKS OF RAISING CONCERNS WITH A BILL. THAT I UNDERSTAND YOU WILL BE. WORKING TO POTENTIALLY ADDRESS IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE YEAH WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO WILL. SUPPORT THE BILL AS AMENDED TO DATE. AND THERE WAS A MOTION AND A SECOND LET ME ASK THE AUTHOR IF YOU ANY FINAL COMMENTS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU WITHOUT MADAM SECRETARY. OCEAN IS PASS A AMENDED THIS TYPE CAN- COMMITTEE ON TRADITION. FEW ARE FEW FIVE THEY ARE CO. YEAH VOTING APRIL. ALL WELL AYE KILEY. AND THE MAIN SHOW CORK SILVA HI FOLKS SILVA I WE- AND TO THREE ZERO SAN WE WILL HOLD THAT FOR OPEN HOLLISTER FALLON FOR AB EIGHT THIRTY TWO THANK YOU- EIGHTY EIGHT THIRTY TWO IS A DISTRICT BILL THAT WOULD SUNSET MORE RESTRICTIVE LAND USE REGULATIONS CONTAINED IN FORMER REDEVELOPMENT PLANS AND HELP BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING AS SOME OF YOU MAY REMEMBER REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES FOR RDAS WERE DISSOLVED IN TWENTY TWELVE. AND SUCCESSOR AGENCIES WERE CREATED TO WIND DOWN THEIR ACTIVITIES DUE TO ITS ENORMOUS SIZE AND SCOPE THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES DID NOT ELECT TO BECOME THE SUCCESSOR AGENCY TO THEIR FORMER RDA INSTEAD GOVERNOR BROWN APPOINTED A DESIGNATED LOCAL AUTHORITY TO TAKE ON THE DUTIES OF THE SUCCESSOR AGENCY. DESPITE THE DISSOLUTION LAND USE REGULATIONS UNDER RT A REMAND EFFECT IN THE CITY. RTA'S MORE STRINGENT LAND USE POLICIES HAVE CONFLICTED WITH PROGRAMS CREATED UNDER VOTER APPROVED MEASURE JJJ NAMELY THE TRANSIT ORIENTED COMMUNITIES PROGRAMMER TOC. THE INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE FORMER REDEVELOPMENT PLANS AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING INCENTIVES HAVE SLOWED THE PRODUCTION OF HOUSING AB EIGHT THIRTY TWO WILL SIMPLY PROVIDE CLARITY BY SUNSETTING THE MORE RESTRICTIVE LAND USE REGULATIONS IN THE FORMER RDA. THE BILL WILL ENSURE THAT THE CITY CONTINUES TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER MEASURE JJJ. AND PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING INCENTIVES THE UNIQUE NATURE OF LA'S REDEVELOPMENT TO SOLUTION REQUIRES LEGISLATION TO REMOVE UNNECESSARY HURDLES AND BOOST HOUSING DEVELOPMENT CLOSER TO TRANSIT AND AMENITIES. AND ON MY OFFICE RECEIVED CONCERNS WITHIN THE LAST- A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THE BILL WOULD WIPE AWAY TENANT PROTECTIONS AND HISTORIC DISTRICT PRESERVATION AND I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THAT IS NOT THE INTENT OF THE BILL SO I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING OUT THE LANGUAGE IN AMENDING THE BILL. TO PROVIDE FURTHER CLARITY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL WE HAVE CRAIG BULLOCK THE PLANNING DIRECTOR FOR THE OFFICE OF COUNCILMEMBER MITCH O'FARRELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO THE OPERATOR TO CURRENT HELLO MISTER BOTH TO SPEAK. GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS CRAIG PORT AND THE PLANNING DIRECTOR FOR COUNCILMEMBER MITCH O'FARRELL PROFITS.

AND BEFORE THAT I WORKED EIGHT YEARS FOR THE FORMER REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY. SO REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES BORDERS OFF NEARLY A DECADE AGO WE CONTINUED TO BE HAMPERED BY THEIR ALLOCATED REQUIREMENTS. THAT TEND TO INCLUDE ALL THE TICKET TODAY AN FIR LIMITATIONS THAN WHAT IS ALLOWED BY. THE COMMUNITY PLANS AND BUILDING. I THINK YOU OF THE CITY'S. ORANGE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM A BILL APPROVED PORTABLE HOUSING AND FOR. WHICH INCLUDES QUITE THAN. THAN THOSE OF BONUS LEGISLATION. WHICH CLAIMS AGAINST THIS BILL IN LARGE PART ARE BEING MADE BY INDIVIDUALS AND PARTIES ASSOCIATED WITH PLAINTIFFS THAT HAVE A HISTORY OF FILING LITIGATION AGAINST THE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY. THE SUCCESSOR AGENCY AND THE CITY. AND ALLOW THREE TO FOUR YEARS APPLICATION HAS INVOLVED THOUSANDS OF UNITS OF HOUSING. INCLUDING HUNDREDS OF UNITS THE PORTABLE HOUSING WITH AN INFILL DEVELOPMENTS SHE IT'S BEEN-ARGUED THAT EIGHTY EIGHT THIRTY TWO WILL REDUCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT OBLIGATIONS THAT THE CITY. HOWEVER IN RELATION TO INCLUSIONARY HOUSING REQUIREMENTS THIS BILL ONLY CLARIFIES BUT IT'S ALREADY BEEN DETERMINED AND REAFFIRMED BY THE COURTS. WHICH IS THAT THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE NOT CURRENTLY IN THE FACT THAT HAVE NOT BEEN IN EFFECT SINCE THE STATE DEVELOPED REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES. IN ADDITION THE TENANT PROTECTIONS THAT ERE FOUND IN THE REDEVELOPMENT PLANS WERE ONLY APPLICABLE TO PROJECTS. THAT RECEIVE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY WHICH IS NOT. OCCURRED TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. THIS IS THE TIME TO THIS. IS REDEVELOPMENT PLANS WORK. TO REMOVE AND A PART HOUSING HAVE BEEN WEAPONIZED AGAINST THOSE OBJECTIVES. THIS BILL WOULD RESULT THAT.

AND MISTER CHAIR THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THIS TIME THANK YOU LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMUNITY COMMONS. IS OUR MOTION OF THIS BEFORE THEIR SECOND. THEIR SECOND VOTE OKAY. I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR- AND- YOUR VISION A GOAL FOR THIS BILL WHICH IS TO ENSURE BUILDING MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND- WE ALL KNOW THAT THROUGHOUT THE STATE THE DISSOLUTION OF REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES HAS LED TO A LOT OF ISSUES AT. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE HOW TO RECONCILE I KNOW THAT WHEN I OPEN UP MY EMAIL BOX THIS MORNING I THINK I WAS SURPRISED I KNOW THE AUTHOR WAS SURPRISED ON SOME OF- THE LAST MINUTE EMAIL WE GOT INVOLVING SOME POTENTIAL OPPOSITION ISSUES AND I APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS- COMMITMENT TO WHILE WORKING THROUGH THESE AYE NOW. I THINK HE'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE LAST PEOPLE THE LEGISLATURE THAT WOULD WANT TO SEE ANY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON TENANTS SO- JUST APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO KEEP WORKING ON THAT BUT WITH THAT ARE HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL MOVING FORWARD LET ME ASK THE AUTHOR IF YOU HAVE ANY FINAL COMMENTS. THANK YOU AND- I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND WITH THAT- THIS IS A MOTION TO PASS TO ASSEMBLY GOVERNMENTAL LOCAL ASSEMBLY KAMALA GOVERNMENT MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. TWO FIVE TWO FIVE THEY ARE DOPE HI SHARED BY GABRIEL. CHOLERA WELL RIGHT I. KILEY KILEY I. MAIENSCHEIN COOK SILVA THANKS TWO BYE WEEKS. FOUR FIVE ZERO ZERO ZERO YOUR BILL PASSES AND A WITHOUT LET US GO NOW TO FILE ITEM NUMBER FIVE THANK YOU AB THIRTEEN NINETY EIGHT. CURRENTLY IF A JURISDICTION DOES NOT ADOPTED HOUSING ELEMENT BY THE STATUTORY DEADLINE IT MUST ADOPT A REVISED HOUSING ELEMENT EVERY FOUR YEARS RATHER THAN EVERY EIGHT. THIS PENALTY FOR NON COMPLIANCE WITH HOUSING ELEMENT ADOPTION DEADLINES HAS PROVEN INEFFECTIVE AND LEAD TO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. FOR EXAMPLE UNDER CURRENT LAW A CITY OR COUNTY CAN ADOPT A LEGALLY DEFICIENT HOUSING ELEMENT ALMOST FOUR MONTHS AFTER THE STATUTORY DEADLINE WITH NO CONSEQUENCES. IN FACT SOME JURISDICTIONS HAVE ADOPTED FAULTY DRAFT ELEMENTS BY THE DEADLINE KNOWING THAT ADDITIONAL CHANGES AND REVISIONS WERE NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW. JUST TO AVOID A PENALTY OF HAVING TO REVISE THE ELEMENT IN FOUR YEARS. IN SOME JURISDICTIONS THE ADOPTED ELEMENT WAS NOT REVISED TO CORRECT THE LEGAL DEFICIENCIES FOR MORE THAN TWELVE MONTHS AFTER THE DEADLINE AND IN SOME CASES NOT FOR YEARS. FOR INSTANCE ONE CITY ADOPTED A DRAFT ELEMENT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT HAD FOUND DID NOT MEET STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS. THE CITY TOOK NO FURTHER ACTION TO REMEDY THE LEGAL DEFICIENCIES UNTIL TWENTY NINETEEN FIVE YEARS AFTER THE CITY WAS ORIGINALLY SUPPOSED TO ADOPT ITS ELEMENT. AB THIRTEEN NINETY EIGHT WOULD ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS BY CLARIFYING THE LAW TO REQUIRE ADOPTION OF AN H. C. D. APPROVED HOUSING ELEMENT BY THE STATUTORY DEADLINE. THE BILL ELIMINATES THE FOR YOUR PENALTY AND INSTEAD PROVIDES THAT FAILURE TO ADOPT ON TIME OBLIGATES THE JURISDICTION TO COMPLETE ANY NECESSARY RESOUNDS WITHIN ONE YEAR. RATHER THAN IN THREE YEARS A LOT FOR JURISDICTIONS THAT ADOPT ON TIME. THANK YOU AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. I WITNESSED TODAY IS BRIAN AUGUSTA CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST LAW PROJECT. THANK YOU LET'S GO TO YOUR WITNESS MISTER ACOSTA. THANK YOU CHAIRED MEMBERS BRIAN GOT STAFF IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTEEN NINETY EIGHT- ADDS THAT. THE AUTHOR NOTED THAT THE ORIGINAL THOUGHT BEHIND THIS- PENALTY WHICH WAS WELL INTENTIONED AND SUPPORTED BY HOUSING OUT TO GET THAT THE AT THE TIME. AND THOUGHT THAT THE PENALTY OF HAVING TO ADOPT TO HOUSING ELEMENT IN A YEAR PERIOD WOULD ENGENDER GREATER COMPLIANCE BUT IT REALLY HASN'T ACHIEVED THAT GOAL FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT HE'S DESCRIBED AND WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF. INSTANCES IN WHICH CITY THE DOCTOR HOUSING ELEMENT SIMPLY TO MEET. THE TIME LINE AS THAT IS NOWHERE NEAR- COMPLYING WITH STATE LAW SO THE CHANGES MADE BY THIS BILL WILL PAY CLOSE THAT LOOPHOLE BY ENSURING THAT THE IN THE HOUSING ELEMENT. DR ED AND APPROVED BY EACH CD DURING. THE REQUIRED TIME LINE. AND THEN. CHANGE THE CONSEQUENCE TO BE ONE THAT'S MORE MEANINGFUL REQUIRE THAT CITIES ADOPT- THE THAT HAVE MEANT MISSED THE- TO THE RESULTING WITHIN HERE THAT BECOMES PARTICULARLY CRITICAL FOR THOSE CITIES AS WE'VE SEEN. WHO HAVING MISSED THE DEADLINE LINGER FOR YEARS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ONCE THEY DO GET THAT OUT AND ALL THE. PLAYERS THAT WE GET THE SITES WE NEED- APPROVED QUICKLY. SO FOR THOSE THREE- WE THINK THIS IMPORTANT OF THE LAW. WELL HELP IN THIS UPCOMING. GETS MORE HOW THEY CAN BE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING- TONIGHT ABOUT. AND WITH THAT THERE ARE NO OTHER WITNESSES- THAT WILL BE TESTIFYING HIS MAIN WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION. LET US NOW GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT LET ME SEE IF THEY'RE ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND- THE COMMITTEE ROOM THERE ARE NONE ANY IN THE REMOTE STATIONS. THERE ARE NONE GOING TO THE PHONE LINES TO THE OPERATOR IF YOU COULD PLEASE. ALLOW INDIVIDUALS WHO WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION TO AB THIRTEEN NINETY EIGHT. BLOOM TO PLEASE DO SO.

I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR MOVING THIS FORWARD I KNOW THIS IS A BILL THAT CONTAINS TWO THEMES. ARE THE REPORT IN THE HOUSING DISCUSSION TODAY ONE HOW INCREASE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR STATES TO FOLLOW STATE HOUSING LAW. AND THEN SECONDLY HOW DO WE LEVERAGE EIGHT CITIES NAY OF PROFILES AND PLICIES. AND OF THIS BILL IS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO BILL FROM LAST YEAR WHICH- MANY OF US SUPPORTED AND WITH THAT HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AGAIN. OUR THERE'S BEEN A MOTION TO MOVE THIS FORWARD IN A SECOND ANY FINAL COMMENTS BY THE AUTHOR THANK YOU AGAIN I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. MADAM SECRETARY. MOTION TO PASS TO THE ASSEMBLY. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO TRY TO HI SAY ARCHR NOW. NO GABRIELLE. KALRA RIGHT FULLER AYE KILEY. MAIENSCHEIN COOK SILVA KIRK SILVA I WEEKS. ONE THREE ZERO SIR ALL RIGHT WILL HOLD THE BILL OPEN AND- I THINK YOU HAVE ONE FINAL BILL I DO THINK THE FILE ITEM TO AB ONE FIFTEEN MISTER BUSH THANK YOU UC I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT- MY FINAL BILL THE- AFTERNOON AB ONE ONE FIVE A BILL TO BUILD HOUSING NEAR TRANSIT CENTERS AND JOBS DURING A TIME WHERE THE STATE DESPERATELY NEEDS MORE HOUSING. I'D LIKE TO STOP AND START BY ACCEPTING THE- COMMITTEES REQUESTED LANGUAGE WHICH READS IT IS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT HI ROAD LABOR POLICIES TO USE A SKILLED CONSTRUCTION WORKFORCE FOR PROJECTS UTILIZING THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ACT. AB ONE ONE FIVE WILL PERMIT HOUSING DEVELOPMENT WITH AT LEAST 20% OF UNITS FOR LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. TO BE ALLOWED ON ANY SITE DESIGNATED FOR COMMERCIAL USES. COMMERCIAL CORRIDORS ARE IDEAL AREAS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING BECAUSE THEY'RE CLOSE TO AMENITIES PUBLIC TRANSIT AND JOB CENTERS. HOWEVER MODERN ZONING THAT SEPARATES RESIDENTIAL AREAS FROM COMMERCIAL AREAS RESTRICT THE NUMBER OF SITES THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. HOUSING PROJECTS ARE THAN DELAYED OR EVEN HALTED DURING THE ARDUOUS AND COSTLY PROCESS OF A ZONE CHANGE THIS PROCESS SIGNIFICANTLY LIMITS THE POTENTIAL FOR MORE SITES TO ALLEVIATE THE HOUSING SHORTAGE. AB ONE ONE FIVE WILL INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SITES FOR HOUSING WHILE MAINTAINING THE CHARACTER OF THE COMMUNITY HOUSING PROJECTS WILL BE LIMITED TO INFILL SITES AND SPECIFIED DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT THE HEIGHT AND DENSITY OF THE BUILDINGS OF THE PROJECTS. NEAR THE SURROUNDING RESIDENTIAL AREAS. ADDITIONALLY THE BILL EXEMPTS SITES ADJACENT AREAS DESIGNATED FOR INDUSTRIAL USE TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF RESIDENTS. AND LASTLY AB ONE ONE FIVE WILL EXEMPT CITIES THAT ZONE FOR THEIR SIXTH RING THE CYCLE. I AM COMMITTING TODAY TO EXEMPT AREAS THAT ARE PROTECTED BY LOCAL VOTER INITIATIVES AND AREAS DESIGNATED TO BE VERY HIGH FIRE SEVERITY ZONES THESE ARE AMENDMENTS THAT WE PROMISED LONG AGO- WE WILL TAKE THESE AMENDMENTS IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE. AS THAT'S THE MOST LOGICAL PLACE- TO DO THAT BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS ARE LISTENING AND UNDERSTAND THAT WE WILL BE TAKING THOSE AMENDMENTS TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS MARINO WYANT VICE PRESIDENT OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS. OF THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM. THE POINT I'M GOING OUT TO EUROPE WITNESS MS WANT. TWENTY HOUSING CONSORTIUM WERE PLEASED TO SPONSOR AB ONE OF FIFTEEN WHICH IS THE REINTRODUCTION OF AB ONE THIRTY ONE OF SEVEN FROM LAST YEAR WHICH PASSED THE ASSEMBLY THIRTY FIFTY TWO TO FOURTEEN. THIS BILL WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF UNITS AVAILABLE TO LOWER INCOME RESIDENTS AND ALLOW THE DEVELOPMENT OF CRITICALLY NEEDED HOUSING AND COMMERCIAL CORRIDORS NEAR TRANSIT AND JOB CENTERS. THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAKES USE THE MIXING SOME PROJECTS ON UNDER UTILIZED RETAIL AND OFFICE PROPERTY CAN SERVE AS A CATALYST FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ADDRESSING CALIFORNIA'S ONGOING HOUSING SHORTAGE. A DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY STUDY BY THE UC BERKELEY TURNER CENTER FOR HOUSING INNOVATION FOUND THE CALIFORNIA'S MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREAS HAVE AN ABUNDANCE OF LAND ZONED FOR COMMERCIAL USES. AND THE ROUGHLY 41% OF COMMERCIAL ZONES IN THE STATE'S FIFTY LARGEST CITIES CURRENTLY PROHIBIT RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT AS DETERMINED BY THEIR BASE ZONING DESIGNATIONS AND ALLOWING RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT IN THESE AREAS COULD INTRODUCE NEW HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES IN VIRTUALLY EVERY. NEIGHBORHOOD. WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO I TO DEVELOPING COLLABORATIVE SOLUTIONS THAT WOULD HELP BUILD DESPERATELY NEEDED HOUSING FOR STRUGGLING FAMILIES SENIORS LOW WAGE WORKERS A FARMWORKERS AND VETERANS WHILE ALSO EXPANDING AND PROVIDING HIGHER WAGES FOR CONSTRUCTION WORKFORCE THAT WILL BUILD THESE HOMES AND FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE JUST SUPPORT TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WE HAVE ONE OF THE MAIN OPPOSITION WITNESS AND- ON THE LINE SHOULD BE RON MILLER THE EXECUTIVE SECRETARY. OF FROM THE L. A. AND ORANGE COUNTY BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL MR MILLER. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I'M RON MILLER EXECUTIVE SECRETARY OF THE LA ORANGE COUNTY BUILDING TRADES. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF FORTY LOCAL UNIONS A HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND SKILLED AND TRAINED MEN AND WOMEN TODAY. THIS WEEK IN OPPOSITION TO AB ONE ONE FIVE. THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A PROCESS STATEWIDE. TO BUILD MOSTLY MARKET RATE HOUSING WHERE HOUSING IS CURRENTLY NOT ALLOWED. IT IS A VERY BIG BILL THAT WILL REMOVE LOCAL DECISION MAKING ACROSS THE STATE. IT IS DESIGNED TO REMOVE LOCAL CONTROL AND ZONING DECISIONS. THIS BILL REMOVED LOCAL VOICES FROM A VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS THAT NEED TO BE HAPPENING ON THE LOCAL LEVEL AND SPECIFICALLY IT REMOVES THE VOICE OF HALF A MILLION OF OUR MEMBERS STATEWIDE. IN A CONVERSATION THAT WILL AFFECT THEIR COMMUNITIES THEIR SCHOOLS IN THEIR LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE. AND IT DOES THIS WITHOUT TAKING IN INTO CONSIDERATION THE WORKFORCE THAT WILL BUILD CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING. THE STATE BUILDING TRADES PRESIDENT ROBBIE HUNTER HAS SAID YOU CAN'T SOLVE THE ISSUE OF POVERTY AND HOUSING BY DRIVING CONSTRUCTION WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES INTO POVERTY. WE'VE BEEN WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO WORK WITH THE SOFT AUTHORS SINCE LAST SESSION TO ADD LANGUAGE THAT WE PROTECT CONSTRUCTION WORKERS INTO THIS BILL. INCLUDING LANGUAGE THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE PAYMENT OF FAIR WAGES. WHAT I HAD MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL WHO WILL BE WHO HAVE BEEN UNWILLING TO SUPPORT. A TRAINED WORKFORCE AND INSTEAD. WOULD RATHER SUPPORT THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY WHERE WAGE THEFT AND LABOR VIOLATIONS RUN RAMPANT. DEVELOPERS WILL MAKE MILLIONS IF NOT BILLIONS OF THIS LEGISLATION PASSES. THERE IS NO RELUCTANCE TO ALLOW THIS PROFIT TO OCCUR THERE'S NO EFFORT TO ASK LAWYERS ACCOUNTANTS LOBBYIST TO MAKE LESS MONEY. THERE IS ONLY IN THE EXPECTATION THAT CONSTRUCTION WORKERS MAKE LESS THAN THEIR TRAINING SUPPORTS. THE INTENT LANGUAGE THIS COMMITTEE IS OFFERED IS JUST THAT INTENT LANGUAGE. ALTHOUGH WE THE GESTURE THIS DOES NOT PROTECT WORKERS THE LEGAL MECHANISM TO PROTECT THE CONSTRUCTION WORKFORCE HAS BEEN SENT TO THIS COMMITTEE AND WE ASK THAT THIS LANGUAGE BE AMENDED AND AB ONE ONE FIVE. THE LANGUAGE THAT WE ARE ASKING FOR DOES NOTHING MORE THAN BRING CONSTRUCTION WORKERS OUT OF THE SHADOWS OF THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY PROVIDE THEM WITH A PATHWAY TO APPRENTICESHIP AND A GOOD MIDDLE CLASS CAREER IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. AND EVERYONE GETS TO CONTRIBUTE TO BUILDING THE WORKFORCE OF TOMORROW. WE CANNOT SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION UNTIL CONSTRUCTION WORKERS ARE PAID FAIRLY AND A SKILLED WORKFORCE IS SUPPORTED. THIS IS A BIG BILL SO IN ADDITION TO THESE BASIC LABOR STANDARDS THAT MORE THAN A DOZEN LEGISLATORS. HAVE ADDED TO THEIR BILLS THIS SESSION WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE A SUNSET ON THE BILL OF THIS SIZE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIS WHEN WE GO TO PAY COMMENTS MONEY FOR START WITH NUMBER. IN THE AUDIENCE HERE. AND THIS GUY HEARING.

THANKS VERY MUCH LET'S BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY COMMENTS COLLEAGUES. MISTER KALRA. I THINK IT WAS THIS YEAR AND- THANK YOU- WITH THE SAME NUMBER FOR BRING THIS FORWARD AND I JUST YOU KNOW I. A COUPLE THINGS I HAD I HAD A BILL LAST YEAR ALSO THAT WAS WITH- REGARDING- PUBLIC SUBSIDIES FINES WHATEVER THE WEATHER WAS FOR. WATER POLLUTION TRANSPLANT OR A LIBRARY OR- OR EVEN A SUBSIDY- FOR A MARKET RATE HOUSING AND IT REQUIRED PREVAILING WAGE- AN- PARTY ARGUMENT WAS MADE AT TIMES. FROM THE- BUILDING INDUSTRIES LIKE WALTER GONNA MAKE IT HARD TO BUILD IF YOU PUT THAT IN THERE. AND I AND I DO AGREE WITH UNDERLYING PRINCIPLE THAT WELL. WE SHOULDN'T HAVE FOLKS BUILDING THAT ARE GOING TO NEED AFFORDABLE HOUSING- THAT WE SHOULD HAVE SOME. OF BASIC- STANDARDS IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE GOOD WAGES AND- THEREFORE AND GOOD QUALITY- WORK AS WELL INTO THE PROJECTS THAT WERE FUNDING. AND I DO APPRECIATE- THE- INTENT LANGUAGE THAT WAS PUT IN I THINK THAT'S VERY HELPFUL IN TERMS OF- A PATH FORWARD. I THINK THAT IT DEFINITELY DEMONSTRATES THAT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY- FOR OF. YOU KNOW WHAT I WHAT I HOPE WILL BE UP OF SOME- COMPROMISED THAT. GOING FORWARD BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATION. OF THE BUILDING TRADES AND YOU'LL HAVE. TO THE IN TERMS OF. THERE'S GOING TO BE- A FACILITATION- FOR MORE BUILDING OF HOUSING WHICH WE ALL NEED. I MEAN I'M IT SOUNDS A- DEFINITELY NEEDED AND YEAH I THINK THERE'S DEFINITELY. ON THESE SITES- HOUSING- THAT I THINK. BE PUT OUT IN BE HELPFUL IN AND CITIES WE WILL BE THEIR GOALS REGION'S. IMAGE THEIR GOAL. AND SO I GUESS MY ONLY MY QUESTIONS WERE FIRST WITH YOU FOR. THE- THE OVER EXCEPT IN THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT INTO LANGUAGE. TO DEVELOP PAN HAROLD PAUL USES GO TO SUCH WORK FOR. PROJECTS YOU KNOW VERGE IS THAT. OF AS YOU MOVE FORWARD IN A- OTHER AND BE UP. OR OF THESE FROM YOUR END TO TRY TO WORK WITH TRY AND OTHER TO. GET A LANGUAGE INTO THE THAT MAY. BE MORE FOR IN TERMS OF THE OF CALL JOBS. AT THOSE AFTER ARE ON. AND TAKE PLACE WILL CONTINUE- AND I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT- IT'S NOT JUST ME- THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN AT THE TABLE AND HAVE BEEN. ACTIVELY. ATTEMPTING TO NEGOTIATE. I DID NOT APPRECIATE THAT AND I HOPE. TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. DEVELOPERS AND OTHERS IT HELPS A FORM HOUSING THAT- THEY'RE BOTH. IN GOALS YOU KNOW BOTH THE BILL OF THE FOR HOUSING. AND- THE QUALITY OF THE JOBS. THAT ARE BEING CREATED THROUGH THAT HOUSING SO THIS IS THE FIRST POLICY COMMITTEE- I'LL- BE VOTING HI WITH THE- AMENDMENT. OF THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE AMENDMENTS IN TERMS THE INTENT LANGUAGE BUT I DO AGREE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE IN THERE. AND I'M HAPPY TO HEAR THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE. CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT WITH THE FOUR THOUSAND DOLLAR PERSON BUT THE BUILDING TRADES I LOOK FORWARD TO THE UP TO THAT WORK THINK BACK ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOU YOU BUY JUST FOR CLARITY'S SAKE- YOU MENTIONED THAT PREVAILING WAGE. AND I WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW THE PREVAILING WHICH IS ALREADY PART OF THE- OF THE NEXT. THAT'S NOT AN ISSUE HERE THESE ARE IN. THE- IN THE- I'D NOT IN THE I THINK IT'S A EXCEPT THE- PART OF FOR- I'VE MADE MS WHITE- CLARIFY THAT- PREVAILING WAGE IS ALREADY PART OF EVERY AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT. YEAH OFFER BOTH ADD PREVAILING WAGE AND ADD SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE LANGUAGE SO LONG AS THEIR GUARD RAILS TO ENSURE THAT IF A WORK FORCE DOES NOT IS NOT THERE IN THEIR BIDS ARE COMING IN THAT MEET THAT REQUIREMENT THE PROJECT COULD STILL MOVE FORWARD- AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVE THIS TO SEE THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL BUT I WOULD BE. I WOULD BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT WHAT THE GUARDRAILS ARE BECAUSE- DETAIL TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S OF. MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITY- FOR THE AND I'M SPEAKING FROM. REALLY FROM MY LOCALITY FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE I'VE SEEN. DEVELOPMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN BUILT- BUT WITH HORRENDOUS WORK STANDARDS AND SOUNDS A THAT- THAT THAT DID HAPPEN BIG SUBSIDIES OF ALASKA. IN RECENT YEARS- IT WAS PART OF WHAT. URGE ME TO- TO PUT FOR DENTAL RIGHT THE LEGISLATION LAST YEAR BUT THE BUILDING TRADES STOP THAT WAS REMARKABLY- EITHER SUBSIDIES MARKET RATE HOUSING OR OTHER TYPES OF PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS- BUT I MEAN I KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AND WE DON'T- HAVE THE GUARDRAILS IN PLACE WITH THE WORKERS- WHICH IS WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT. I'M GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR AS A BILL WAS FOR THANK YOU UNDERSTOOD. THANK YOU. OTHER COMMENTS AS WORKS. I THINK YOU CHAIR THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL FOR THAT WANNA LINE- COMMENTS ALSO WITH MIKE- FROM SAN JOSE- KNOW JUST ASK THAT YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT BILL WE OBVIOUSLY NEED MORE HOUSING WE HAVE TO DO THAT- BUT JUST AND CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS AND A COMMITMENT FROM YOU ON THAT WOULD BE AS YOU HAVE GIVEN VERY HELPFUL SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT- UNDER THE PROPENSITY WILL CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION. OF COURSE FROM THE BEGINNING I'VE FELT THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT- NOT ONLY NEEDS TO BE COMPROMISED BUT- I BELIEVE IT WILL BE. MISS CLARK SILVA. I TO I'M GOING TO SAY YES- UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS THAT YOU CONTINUE YOUR EFFORTS REGARDING THE OPPOSITION- I DO WANT TO MAKE SOME MORE GENERAL COMMENTS THOUGH RELATED TO HOUSING HE SOME OF US HAVE NOW BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE FOR A FEW YEARS BUT SOME OF US HAVE WORKED IN THIS SPACE I COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND WE HAVE SEEN MANY MANY BILLS COME THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE AND THE LAST HANDFUL OF YEARS- THAT REALLY ARE FOCUSED ON TRYING TO CREATE REALLY A PACKAGE THAT MOVES CALIFORNIA FORWARD AND WE KNOW THAT TOO MANY WAYS AND TIMES WE'VE FALLEN SHORT SO WHETHER IT'S A GROWING HOMELESS. POPULATION WHETHER IT'S TRYING TO LOOK AT HOW DO WE HOUSE- PEOPLE OF OUR COMMUNITY WITH SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WHETHER IT BE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE VERY VERY DIFFICULT BILLS THAT HAVE COME TO OUR COMMITTEE MIGHT COME AGAIN IN THE FUTURE- WHAT IT BE RENT CONTROL WE HAVE. DEALT WITH VERY COMPLEX ISSUES AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE SO FOR. THOSE THAT ARE OUT THERE LISTENING WHETHER IT'S THE TRADES THE BUILDING TRADES. WHETHER IT'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADVOCATES WHETHER IT'S- PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT ANY CHANGE AT ALL AND WE HERE AT ALL WE HEAR PLEASE DON'T SUPPORT THIS BILL IT'S TOO AGGRESSIVE ARE PLEASE MOVE THIS FORWARD BUT WHAT WE KNOW IS WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE ENTIRE ASPECTS HERE AND HOUSING. AND ONE OF THE THINGS FOR SURE IS WE'RE NOT BUILDING ENOUGH AND AS WE DON'T BUILD ENOUGH WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PRODUCTION WE CERTAINLY SEE THOSE PRICES INCREASE FOR EVEN THE MOST- BASIC SINGLE FAMILY HOME STARTER HOMES SOMETIMES NOW AT LEAST AN ORANGE COUNTY CLOSE TO EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH KEEPS MANY MANY PEOPLE OUT OF THE MARKET. BUT WE HAVE A LOT TO DO I SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT STARTING TO LOOK AT PRODUCTION IT'S ABOUT STARTING TO LOOK AT HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD- BUT I WOULD JUST AGAIN SAY EVERYBODY HAS TO TAKE SOME STEPS HERE AND EVERYBODY HAS TO BE AT THE TABLE WILLING TO US GET OUT OF EACH OTHER'S WAY IN MANY WAYS- SO. WILL KEEP LOOKING AT IT BUT I WILL SUPPORT IT TODAY. THANK YOU I KNOW MR KILEY WISHES TO SPEAK. JUST A CLARIFICATION I HEARD FROM THE WITNESS THAT- THERE'S GOING TO BE- REQUIREMENT IS THE LANGUAGE THAT PUTS IN SCUTTLED TRANS WORK FIRST LANGUAGE AND PREVAILING WAGE LANGUAGE BUT THEN. THAT WOULDN'T APPLY IF THERE AREN'T ANY DID SO UNDER THOSE TREES THAT THAT PLAN FOR HOW THIS IS GONNA OF ALL. I DON'T WANT TO GET TOO FAR INTO THE DETAILS OF NEGOTIATIONS BECAUSE THEY ARE AT A VERY SENSITIVE POINT RIGHT NOW- I'M NOT SURE IF MS WHITE WANTS TO. PROVIDE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. THANKS- YES I WAS JUST- SHARING WHAT WE HAD OFFERED TO THE TRADES BACK IN JANUARY AS A COMPROMISE- ADD TO IT TO REQUIRE PREVAILING WAGE ANTI REQUIRES SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE- WITH GUARDRAILS TO ENSURE THAT IF BIDS DO NOT COME IN TO MEET THOSE REQUIREMENTS WE COULD STILL MOVE FORWARD WITH OTHER KIDS. SHE SAID I WAS OFFERED A AND IT WAS REJECTED OR WHAT WAS THAT HI I WOULD SAY THAT THE CONVERSATIONS ARE ONGOING. I'M GOING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER COMMENTS MR GRUBER. YES THANK YOU MISTER TURNER I WOULD JUST ALONG WITH THE GENERAL SENTIMENT THAT- MY DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES HAVE EXPRESSED SO FAR AND JUST MAYBE I DON'T OBSERVATION WHICH IS THAT YOU KNOW I WISH YOU GREAT SUCCESS IN THOSE NEGOTIATIONS I THINK THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE. WHERE WE CAN DO TWO THINGS AT ONCE THAT ARE DESPERATELY NEEDED FOR THE STATE WE CAN CREATE SOME GOOD PAYING JOBS THEY'RE GONNA PUT A LOT OF PEOPLE TO WORK AS WE ARE CRISIS TO COPE IN ALSO ADDRESS OUR STATE'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS SO THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY HERE FOR A TRUE WIN WIN FOR WORKERS FOR WORKING FAMILIES FOR FOLKS WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THEIR COMMUNITY SO WE CAN DO A LOT HERE WITH. IF WE CAN REACH SOME COMPROMISE SO I WANT TO WISH YOU GOOD LUCK WITH THOSE NEGOTIATIONS AND- I WILL BE SUPPORTED- TODAY AS WELL. THANK YOU. NO COMMENTS COLLEAGUES. ALL OF. JOINED A- THE SUN. THAT YOU'VE HEARD I. WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR. FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. WE NEED TO HAVE. AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AND HOW WE BETTER UTILIZE UNDER UTILIZED COMMERCIAL LAND FOR HOUSING. ESPECIALLY FOR PORTABLE HOUSING. ALSO AFFECT THE BUILDING TRADES FOR THEIR- STEADFAST SUPPORT. FOR ENSURING THAT SUCH HOUSING IS BUILT. BY WELL TRAINED WELL PAID WORKFORCE. BOTH THE HOUSING AND THE QUALITY OF JOBS THAT CREATE THE HOUSING. ARE CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT I THINK THAT'S A VALUE THAT WE- ALL SHARE AND- ON SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY SO WE CAN KEEP THIS. CONVERSATION GOING. AS I MENTIONED- TO AT LEAST A ONE OR TWO OF YOU I'D ASK THE AUTHOR. TO ACCEPT THE MEMBER LANGUAGE THAT WE HAD TAKEN FROM SB FIVE WHICH IS. THE HOUSING BOND PROPOSAL BY SENATE.

FIFTY POINT SIXTY ZERO THE BILL PASSES ARE WE I DON'T YOU TO TAKE A STILL. NINE NINETY. FILE ITEM TWELVE AB NINETY NINE. THANK YOU MISTER TURN NUMBER AND I TO START- THANKING YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR THE ASSISTANCE ON THIS BILL. WE TODAY PRESENTED AS IT WOULD CREATE A SPECIALIZED APPEAL PANEL. KNOWN AS THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS SITUATIONS WHERE LOCAL OFFICIALS SEEK TO PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN VIOLATION OF STATE LAW. LEGISLATION IS A MODEST EFFORT TO STRENGTHEN TE PURPOSE AND INTENT OF THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT. INITIALLY PASSED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT AIMS TO PREVENT EFFORTS TO BLOCK THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THAT OTHERWISE COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLES GENERAL PLAN ZONING AND SUBDIVISION STANDARDS REQUIRES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO MAKE SPECIFIC FINDINGS IN THE EVENT THEY DO SO. UNFORTUNATELY DESPITE CALIFORNIA'S WELL DOCUMENTED AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE DEFIED THE ACT. THE TONIGHT AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS EVEN WHEN THEY ARE FULLY COMPLIANT WITH ALL LOCAL ZONING AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THESE OFFICIALS UNDERSTAND THAT IN MOST CASES AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROPONENTS WILL HAVE NO PRACTICAL MEANS TO CHALLENGE THE UNLAWFUL DENIAL. AS THE CURRENT REMEDY LITIGATION IN SUPERIOR COURT. IS ALMOST ALWAYS PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE TIME CONSUMING AND OTHERWISE IMPRACTICAL. AB NINETY NINE WOULD ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM BY CREATING ALTERNATE REVIEW PANEL WITH SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE. IMPORTANTLY THE JURISDICTION OF THE REVIEW PANEL WOULD BE VERY NARROW AND WHETHER THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT VIOLATED THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT. BUT JUST APPROVING A PROJECT WITHOUT MAKING APPROPRIATE FINDINGS AS REQUIRED BY LAW. THE PANEL WOULD BEST BE ABLE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES AROUND THE IMPROPER AND UNLAWFUL DEMANDS OF AFFORDABLE HANDING. IN A MORE EXPEDITED LESS EXPENSIVE LESS CONFRONTATIONAL AND MORE CONSISTENT MANNER. TO BE CLEAR THIS BILL SIMPLY PROVIDES A NEW PROCEDURAL REMEDY TO RESOLVE DISPUTES IT DOES NOT OBSERVE ON CHANGING THE LOCAL ZONING OR LAND USE POLICIE. OR OTHERWISE CHANGE SUBSTANTIVE STATE LAW AROUND HOUSING. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO FOLLOW STATE LAW IN GOOD FAITH ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO HAVE ANY INTERACTION WITH THIS NEW REVIEW PANEL. WELL THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY AND WILLFULLY VIOLATING THE LAW WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE. THIS LESS ADVERSARIAL AND MORE COST EFFECTIVE SUPPORT APPROACH IS SUPPORTED BY. A BROAD COALITION OF HOUSING GROUPS ADVOCATES AND LOCAL OFFICIALS INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING COURT CONSORTIUM. THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR ROLE HOUSING SACRAMENTO MAYOR DARRELL STEINBERG. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY OR TWENTY BILLION FOR THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION AND MARK STIVERS FROM THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP. THANK YOU AND WEBER KRESSLEY RESPECT AN AYE VOTE.

HOUSING PRODUCTION OR BOOKS TODAY- AT THE TO STEP WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT QUALITY CRIMES HOW ALL THE BILL WOULD NOT BE AN ISSUE HELLO. AND WHAT BETTER RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR BIBLE TIME COME. THAT ARE ON WELCOMING OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING- THE PARTNERSHIP HERE'S MY DEVELOPERS THEY WILL DOES NOT TAKE THE FINANCIAL RISK TO BUY A PROPERTY IF THEY DON'T THINK THEY CAN GET THROUGH THE LOCAL DEPARTMENT PROCESS- WHILE THE EXISTING HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT IN THREE PROTECT DEVELOPER FROM ARBITRARY DENIALS ARE UNREASONABLE CONDITIONS. IT IS A RELATIVELY EMPTY PROTECTION VERY FEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS WILL SPEND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN LEGAL FEES INTEREST AND ADDITIONAL CARRYING COSTS AND AT LEAST TWO YEARS IN COURT- TO- OTHER TIME TO GO THROUGH THE COURTS. THIS ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS BODY CONCEPT HAS BEEN TRIED AND FOUND SUCCESSFUL IN MASSACHUSETTS WHERE IT'S BEEN IN PLACE SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE RHODE ISLAND ILLINOIS AND OREGON. OUR DEVELOPERS TELL IN AB EIGHT NINE EIGHTY NINE WILL SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE RISK PROFILE OF GIVING THEM GREATER CERTAINTY AND CONFIDENCE TO BRING AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROPOSALS FORWARD AND MORE IMPORTANTLY GET THEM BUILT. AB NINETY NINE IS ABOUT EFFICIENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. WE STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU THERE IS NO MAN OPPOSITION WITNESS. WHY DON'T WE GO TO.

WHEN IT COMES TO MEETING OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING TARGETS. WHATEVER HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS FOSTER'S LANDING WAS BUILT IN THE MID NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND INCLUDED SEVENTY FOUR BELOW MARKET RATE RENTAL UNITS. THE PMR RESTRICTIONS WERE SET TO EXPIRE IN PHASES STARTING WITH FIFTY UNITS EXPIRING AT THE END OF LAST YEAR. I WITH THE FINAL PHASE EXPIRING AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. FOR THE THIRTY UNITS THAT WERE SET TO EXPIRE LAST YEAR THE CITY AND THE PROPERTY OWNER AGREED TO EXTEND AFFORDABLE RENTS TO THE PEACE ONE TENANTS UNTIL DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF THIS YEAR. THE CITY ALLOCATED FUNDS TO PAY ITS SHARE OF THIS PROGRAM. HOWEVER AT THE END OF THIS YEAR THE RESIDENTS IN THE PMR UNITS APOSTAS LANDING WILL SEE THEIR MONTHLY RENT INCREASE FROM FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. TO APPROXIMATELY THIRTY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS. THE BOSTON HAS TAKEN SEVERAL STEPS TO ASSIST THE TENANTS OF FOSTER'S LADY AND ALL RESIDENTS ARE CITY. WHO LIVE IN OR ARE LOOKING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS IN THE BAY AREA HAVE EXTREMELY LOW TURNOVER AND A VERY LONG WEIGHTLESS. AB TEN TWENTY NINE WOULD BETTER POSITION THE CITY TO COMPLETE COMPETE FOR FUNDS THROUGH THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM. AN EFFORT TO SECURE A LONG TERM FUNDING SOURCE FOR FOSTER'S LAND. WELL HOUSING PRODUCTION IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN ADDRESSING THE HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR STATE.
