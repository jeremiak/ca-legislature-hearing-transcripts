00:32:42.093 --> 00:32:44.228
LIFE AND FLORIDA'S STAND YOUR

00:32:44.295 --> 00:32:45.330
GROUND LAWS ARE VERY DIFFERENT.

00:32:45.396 --> 00:32:47.031
THAN WHAT THIS IS ABOUT BUT I

00:32:47.098 --> 00:32:48.366
THINK ABOUT THE CASES OF FREDDIE

00:32:48.433 --> 00:32:48.566
GRAY.

00:32:48.633 --> 00:32:50.735
IN BALTIMORE I THINK ABOUT.

00:32:50.802 --> 00:32:54.339
A OF THE CASES IN NEW YORK

00:32:54.405 --> 00:32:56.441
WITHOUT HIM THE GENTLEMAN WHO

00:32:56.507 --> 00:32:58.309
SAID I CAN'T BREATHE ERIC.

00:32:58.376 --> 00:33:00.111
ERIC GARDNER THANK YOU.

00:33:00.178 --> 00:33:01.546
AND OF THE VARIOUS DIFFERENT

00:33:01.612 --> 00:33:02.947
CASES THAT WE'VE SEEN ACROSS THE

00:33:03.014 --> 00:33:05.550
COUNTRY THAT HAVE BEEN BALD.

00:33:05.616 --> 00:33:07.385
THIS TYPE OF SITUATION AND IF WE

00:33:07.452 --> 00:33:08.186
HAD.

00:33:08.252 --> 00:33:09.253
THE LAW IF WE HAVE THE BODY

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.621
CAMERA.

00:33:10.688 --> 00:33:11.989
FOOTAGE THAN MAYBE THE PUBLIC

00:33:12.056 --> 00:33:12.990
WOULD HAVE HAD A DIFFERENT

00:33:13.057 --> 00:33:14.325
PERSPECTIVE AND WE'D GONE TO A

00:33:14.392 --> 00:33:16.060
DIFFERENT SPACE BUT THIS IS

00:33:16.127 --> 00:33:17.695
WHERE WE ARE NOW AND WE HAVE TO

00:33:17.762 --> 00:33:18.663
WORK TOGETHER TO TRY TO FIGURE

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:20.565
OUT HOW WE INFORM THE PUBLIC AND

00:33:20.631 --> 00:33:21.966

00:33:24.902 --> 00:33:26.571
BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY AND AND

00:33:26.637 --> 00:33:27.939
THE WAY THE CALIFORNIA WORKS IN

00:33:28.005 --> 00:33:29.207

I EVEN THOUGHT OF MY OWN BODY

CAM.

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:54.298

ANGELES POLICE PROTECTIVE LEAGUE.

00:34:06.511 --> 00:34:07.879
I THOUGHT IT WAS AN EXCELLENT --

00:34:07.945 --> 00:34:10.181
WAY OF IMPLEMENTING BODY CAMERAS

00:34:10.248 --> 00:34:11.783
AND A WHOLE POLICY.

00:34:11.849 --> 00:34:13.518

TO THE GUN.

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:19.223
BUT IT IT IT SHOWED ME AT THAT

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:20.992
TIME WE WE COULD HAVE A GOOD

00:34:21.058 --> 00:34:22.160
DIALOGUE ABOUT HOW TO MOVE THIS

00:34:22.226 --> 00:34:23.861

COSTLY IT WAS HOW WE COULDN'T --

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:34.639
KEEP INFORMATION AND AND THAT

00:34:34.705 --> 00:34:36.307
DEPARTMENTS WOULDN'T IMPLEMENT.

00:34:36.374 --> 00:34:37.508
DEPARTMENTS ARE IMPLEMENTED

00:34:37.575 --> 00:34:39.277
RIGHT NOW ON THEIR OWN WITHOUT A

00:34:39.343 --> 00:34:40.945
LAW.

00:34:41.012 --> 00:34:42.947
WITHOUT HIS FORTUNE AND MATCH TO

00:34:43.014 --> 00:34:45.249

00:34:45.316 --> 00:34:46.217
GREAT THAT REMOVING.

00:34:46.284 --> 00:34:47.852

STATEWIDE GUIDELINE.

00:34:49.921 --> 00:34:51.989
AND AND ALTHOUGH JUSTICE MAY NOT

00:34:52.056 --> 00:34:53.558
BE THAT MAY NOT GONE AS FAR AS I

00:34:53.624 --> 00:34:55.193
WOULD LIKE.

00:34:55.259 --> 00:34:56.761
I THINK IT HAS BEEN WATERED DOWN

00:34:56.828 --> 00:34:57.762
THERE'S A THERE'S A DISTANT

00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:59.263
THINGS IN HERE I THINKHELP BOTH

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:00.665
SIDES I'VE HEARD FROM LAW

00:35:00.731 --> 00:35:01.566
ENFORCEMENT.

00:35:01.632 --> 00:35:03.935
THAT BECAUSE OF BODY CAMERAS --

00:35:04.001 --> 00:35:05.470
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICES WHO'VE

00:35:05.536 --> 00:35:07.472
BEEN WRONGLY ACCUSED.

00:35:07.538 --> 00:35:09.907
OF CRIMES CAN NOW PROVE.

00:35:09.974 --> 00:35:11.709
BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT THAT

00:35:11.776 --> 00:35:14.145
THEY DID NOT USE RACIAL EPITHET

00:35:14.212 --> 00:35:15.179
THEY DID NOT BEAT SOMEONE OR

00:35:15.246 --> 00:35:15.379
THAT.

00:35:15.446 --> 00:35:17.181
THEY DID NOT.

00:35:17.248 --> 00:35:17.715
IT WOULD NOT OUT OF POLICE

00:35:17.782 --> 00:35:19.951

THE BODY CAM --

00:35:21.419 --> 00:35:23.120
FOOTAGE AND SO I THINK IT WORKS

00:35:23.187 --> 00:35:25.623
BOTH WAYS ON TO PROTECT OFFICERS

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:27.325
