ACTUALLY WILL GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED SOMEWHERE OTHER MEMBERS WILL UP WILL BE TRICKLING AND SO BUT IN THE INTEREST OF. OF OUR SPEAKERS WHO'VE TRAVELED MANY OF THEM LONG DISTANCES TO BE HERE WE WANT TO GIVE. AMPLE OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE AND. AND MOVE FORWARD SO THIS POINT A MINUTE JUST MAKE SOME OPENING REMARKS AND PASS IT OFF TO MY CO CHAIR A DOCTOR ARAMBULA SO. FIRST OF ALL GOOD AFTERNOON AND WELCOME TO THE FOURTH IN A SERIES OF HEARINGS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON HEALTH CARE DELIVERY. AND UNIVERSAL COVERAGE AS WE DIG DEEPER INTO THIS POLICY RECOGNIZE THAT IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN DEFINING A PATHWAY TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE WE MUST ADDRESS SOME OBVIOUS AND POTENTIAL CHALLENGES RELATED STATE. AND FEDERAL LAW. FOR EXAMPLE MEDICARE IS FUNDED THROUGH A PROTECTED MEDICARE TRUST FUND AND FEDERAL LAW ESTABLISHES THE RULES FOR HOW THAT MONEY CAN BE SPENT. ACCESS IN THOSE FUNDS WOULD REQUIRE CONGRESSIONAL ACTION. THEY'RE ALSO STATE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES PROP NINETY EIGHT REQUIRES FORTY PERCENT OF STATE GENERAL FUND REVENUES TO GO TO QUE TO FOURTEEN EDUCATION. BEGAN LIMITS FROM PROPOSITIONS THIRTEEN FOUR IMPOSED SPENDING LIMITS ON THE STATE. TO ENSURE THAT REVENUE IN IT IN EXCESS OF THOSE LIMITS WOULD BE RETURNED TO TAXPAYERS. IF TAXES WERE INCREASED TO FIND A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM HOW WOULD THOSE REVENUES BE AFFECTED. THREE POINT THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS GET THEIR COVERAGE THROUGH SELF INSURED OR SELF FUNDED PLANS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO A RECESS. ADMINISTERED BY THE US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. THEY ARE EXEMPT FROM THE STATE SPECIFIC INSURANCE REGULATIONS. TODAY WE HAVE IMPRESSIVE PANEL OF EXPERTS WHO WILL WALK US THROUGH THESE ISSUES AND MORE. FOLLOWING EACH PRESENTATION THE MEMBERS WILL HAVE A THE OPPORTUNITY ASK QUESTIONS THE LAST TWO PANELS WERE PRESENT TOGETHER. MEMBERS WILL HAVE AN OPTION AS QUESTIONS AFTER THEY PRESENT. WILL ALSO HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT I'D LIKE TO ENSURE THAT DURING THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD WE ALLOWS MANY PEOPLE TO SPEAK AS POSSIBLE. I CRINGE EVERYONE TO BE RESPECTFUL ND MORE AND LIMIT THEIR PRE* INSTITUTE TWO MINUTES DURING THE. PUBLIC COMMENT MORE DETAILED WRITTEN COMMENTS ARE WELCOMED AND CAN MEET SUBMITTED DIRECTLY TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERYMUCH I THAT I'D LIKE TO INVITE MARCO CHAIR. DOCTOR LOOKING ARAMBULA TO OFFER THE OPENING REMARKS. THANK YOU. I'D LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE FOR ATTENDING TODAY'S HEARING. THIS HEARING IS THE FIFTH IN A SERIES OF HEARINGS THAT WE'VE HAD TO EXPLORE THE WAYS TO IMPROVE OUR STATE'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. AND PROVIDE UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. IN OUR PREVIOUS HEARINGS WE FOCUSED ON CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT SYSTEM. INCLUDING PUBLIC PROGRAMS THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET EMPLOYER BASED COVERAGE. SAFETY NET PROGRAMS AND CURRENT GAPS IN COVERAGE. WE'VE ALSO HEARD ABOUT MODELS OF UNIVERSAL COVERAGE SYSTEMS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. WE'VE HAD EXPERTS SHARE DETAILS ABOUT DIFFERENT MODELS AND PROGRAMS FROM DIFFERENT STATES AND OUR LAST HEARING WE HEARD ABOUT CHALLENGES IN ACCESSING CARE. AND THE BECAUSE OF HIGH PRICES. THANKS TO THESE HEARINGS THE MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE HAVE A MUCH BETTER APPRECIATION OF THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THAT BEING SAID I BELIEVE TODAY'S HEARING. MAYBE THE MOST IMPORTANT HEARING WE'VE HAD TO DATE. WE WILL FOCUS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES AND CONSIDERATIONS WILL NEED TO ADDRESS AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH ANY CHANGES TO CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. THIS COMMITTEE'S CHARGE IS TO FIND WORKABLE SOLUTIONS THAT WILL EXPAND HEALTHCARE COVERAGE AND INCREASED ACCESS TO CARE. THAT IS WHY I BELIEVE THAT TODAY'S HEARING MAYBE THE MOST IMPORTANT HEARING. IF WE CAN IDENTIFY THE IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS AND CHALLENGES WELL UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES WE FACE IN IMPROVING OUR CURRENT HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. I AM INTERESTED IN HEARING ABOUT WHAT CURRENT FEDERAL LAW WILL ALLOW US TO DO. AND NOT TO DO. WE ALSO NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE CONSTRAINTS ARE STATE'S CONSTITUTION PUT ON EXPANSION PROPOSALS. FINALLY WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE PAY FOR ANY CHANGES WE WANT TO MAKE. AS THE CHAIR OF THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES I BELIEVE IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT WILL COST TAXPAYERS AND HOW WE PAY FOR EXPANSIONS TO OUR SYSTEM. AS WE WORK TOWARDS THE IDEAL THAT HEALTHCARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT IN CALIFORNIA. TODAY'S HEARING WILL HELP INFORM US HOW WE MOVE FORWARD. AS I HAVE SAID MANY TIMES NOW WE ARE CALIFORNIA WE DON'T FOLLOW WE LEAD. AND NOW BEFORE WE START THE REST OF OUR HEARING I'D LIKE TO OFFER OUR FELLOW MEMBERS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR AN OPENING STATEMENT. OKAY. WILL GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED THEN WE HAVE AN OVERVIEW SUSAN PHILLIPS SENIOR HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT CONSULTING WITH MILLIMAN. SHE'S FOCUSES ON DEVELOPING PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS TO ALIGN INCENTIVES IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM TO ENCOURAGE VALUE QUALITY AND ACCESS. SUSAN. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I WANTED THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. AS PART OF THESE VERY IMPORTANT SERIES OF HEARINGS. AS A LONGTIME RESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA AS A PATIENT AND USER OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM MYSELF. I'M EXCITED THAT YOU'RE UNDERTAKING EFFORTS TO CONSIDER OUR HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM AND HOW TO MAKE IT BETTER AND MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR ALL MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY. AS MENTIONED I AM HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT WHAT MILLIMAN MILLMAN IS AN INDEPENDENT CONSULTING FIRM OFFERING ACTUARIAL AND RELATED SERVICES TO PUBLIC AND. PRIVATE SECTOR CLIENTS AROUND THE COUNTRY. WE ROUTINELY ROUTINELY WORK WITH PUBLIC PARTNERS I INCLUDING STATE MEDICAID PROGRAMS STATE EMPLOYEE HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAMS AS WELL AS PROVIDERS PAYERS AND EMPLOYERS. YOU ALREADY HAD A NUMBER OF SPEAKERS THROUGHOUT THESE INFORMATIVE HEARINGS AND ARE ALREADY WELL VERSED IN THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR HEALTHCARE. SYSTEM. MY JOB TODAY'S TO GIVE YOU AN OVERVIEW OF IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES. THAT WOULD ARISE DEPENDING ON THE POLICY SOLUTIONS YOU ARE CONSIDERING. MY GOAL IS TO PROVIDE YOU A USEFUL FRAMEWORK TO EVALUATE VARIOUS PROPOSALS THAT YOU MAY BE CONSIDERING OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS OR MONTHS. I'M GONNA T. OF THE KEY IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND THE SPEAKERS THAT ARE FOLLOWING ME WILL PRESENT A DEEPER DIVE INTO EACH OF THE AREAS I WILL LAY OUT. I WILL NOTE THAT MOST OF MY COMMENTS. ARE ALSO SUMMARIZED IN A REPORT THAT WAS FUNDED BY THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION AND CO AUTHORED BY MYSELF AND MARY MULTI CALLED KEY QUESTIONS WHEN CONSIDERING A STATE BASED SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM. IN CALIFORNIA. I BELIEVE YOU MAY ALREADY HAVE. THAT REPORT IS PART OF YOUR BRIEFING MATERIALS. I'M ONE OF THE KEY THEMES I CAME THAT HAS COME OUT OUT OF THE HEARING SO FAR IS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS MADE A LOT QUITE A LOT OF PROGRESS. IN REDUCING THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED IN CALIFORNIA IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AND REALLY MOVING TOWARDS UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. HOWEVER THERE DOES REMAIN ABOUT THREE MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE ARE UNINSURED. AND ALSO EVEN WITH PROGRESS TOWARDS UNIVERSAL COVERAGE MUCH WORK REMAINS TO BE DONE TO IMPROVE AFFORDABILITY IMPROVE ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE BENEFITS. AND REDUCE FRAGMENTATION AND EFFICIENCIES OF OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THERE ARE MANY POLICY APPROACHES TO ACHIEVING UNIVERSAL COVERAGE AND THESE MAY INCLUDE SINGLE PAYER A PUBLIC OPTION. A POLICY AND OR POLICY APPROACHES A BUILD ON EXISTING PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICAL OR COVER CALIFORNIA. I WON'T BE GETTING INTO EACH OF THESE UP POLICY OPTIONS IN DETAIL BUT INSTEAD I'LL BE RAISING KEY IMPLEMENTATION QUESTIONS FOR YOU TO CONSIDER. ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I WANT TO DO IS JUST CLARIFY SOME TERMINOLOGY. FIRST WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT WHEN WE REFER TO SINGLE PAYER. AND THE DEFINITION YOU SEE ON THIS SLIDE IS ONE THAT WE LAID OUT IN THE PAPER AND HAS GENERAL CONSENSUS. BUT FUNDAMENTALLY SINGLE PAYER IS A SINGLE CENTRALIZED PUBLIC. PUBLICLY ORGANIZED MEANS TO COLLECT HEALTHCARE DOLLARS AND PAY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES FOR ALL MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY. I HIGHLY THE WORD SINGLE HERE BECAUSE IT IT DOES APPLY JUST SAT SINGLE AND NOT A MULTIPLE PAYER SYSTEM. AS ALL OF YOU KNOW WE CURRENTLY OPERATE IN A MULTIPLE PAYER SYSTEM INCLUDING MEDICARE MEDICAID I'LL COVER CALIFORNIA CALPERS. AND FEDERAL PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION AND A NUMBER OF PRIVATE PAYERS. THE NEXT TERM I ONCE YOU DEFINE IS UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. SOMETIMES A NOTION OF SINGLE PAYER AND UNIVERSAL COVERAGE GETS A BIT MUDDLED. BUT IMPORTS NO THAT THE IDEA OF SINGLE PAYER AND UNIVERSAL COVERAGE ARE ARE DISTINCT. UNIVERSAL COVERAGE IS REALLY TALKING ABOUT. MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE. IT'S REALLY TALKING ABOUT ALL COVERED LIVES AND MAKING SURE THEY'VE ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE IN SOME WAY. SINGLE PAYER IS REALLY TALKING ABOUT THE PAYMENT SYSTEM WHICH USES ONE PUBLICLY ORGANIZED CENTRAL MEANS OF PAYING FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES. SO I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS HELPFUL TO TEE UP THOSE DEFINITIONS. AS I MENTIONED UNIVERSAL COVERAGE CAN BE ACHIEVED THROUGH A VARIETY OF POLICY OPTIONS. INCLUDING SINGLE PAYER PUBLIC OPTION OR EXTENDING CURRENT COVERAGE PROGRAMS. AND SOME OF THESE POLICY OPTIONS MIGHT BE BROAD AND EXPANSIVE WHILE OTHERS MIGHT BE CONSIDERED INCREMENTAL. THE ANCHOR MENTAL APPROACHES ARE LIKELY TO HAVE FEWER IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES THEN SAY BROAD EXPANSIVE APPROACHES LIKE SINGLE LIKE SINGLE PAYER. AND THAT'S ESPECIALLY TRUE IF A NEW POLICY APPROACH REQUIRES PEOPLE TO CHANGE HEALTHCARE COVERAGE. AND. IT TO THE TO CHANGE THE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE THAT THEY CURRENTLY HAVE. SO ULTIMATELY ITS SUPPORT FOR POLICYMAKERS TO CONSIDER THE TRADE OFFS OF THE POLICY APPROACHES. THE COSTS THE DISRUPTION THAT MIGHT MIGHT ENSUE. AND OF COURSE THE BENEFITS. AND IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER WHAT'S REALLY ACHIEVABLE IN THE SHORT TERM VERSUS A LONGER TERM. AND AS YOU ALL KNOW. NOT EVERY GOALS ACHIEVABLE OVERNIGHT. SO I WOULD SAY IT'S IMPORTANT TO LAY OUT A ROADMAP ARTICULATING WHAT THE FINAL DESTINATION IS. WHETHER IT BE SINGLE PAYER OR SOME OTHER MEANS OF OF ACHIEVING UNIVERSAL AFFORDABLE COVERAGE. IN ADDITION TO LAYING OUT A ROADMAP I'M A BIG PROPONENT. OF CAREFULLY ASSESSING POLICY OPTIONS TO MINIMIZE ANY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. AND TO UNDERSTAND COURSE PROJECTED COSTS AND BENEFITS OF VARIOUS OPTIONS. SO THE I'LL GET INTO THIS A LITTLE BIT LATER MY PRESENTATION WHEN I LAY OUT A FRAMEWORK OF COMPARING VARIOUS OPTIONS. SO I'M GONNA WALK THROUGH A COUPLE OF ON IMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION QUESTIONS AND I'M CALLING FIRST ORDER QUESTIONS. ONE FIRST ORDER QUESTION OF COURSES WHO'S IN AND WHO'S OUT. AS WE'VE ALREADY HEARD OF THERE ARE CONSIDERATIONS RELATED TO. WHICH POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA WOULD BE CONSIDERED. UNDER A NEW UP PAYMENT MODEL. SO WITH EVERY HOUSEHOLD IN EVERY CONSUMER IN CALIFORNIA BE INCLUDED IN A POLICY PROPOSAL. SO FOR EXAMPLE FOR TALKING ABOUT A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM WOULD WE INCLUDE THE SIX MILLION MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES IN CALIFORNIA. ABOUT FORTY PERCENT OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES SO ABOUT TWO MILLION ARE ENROLLED IN MEDICARE ADVANTAGE WHICH MEANS THEY GET COVERAGE THROUGH A HEALTH PLAN. WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE OPTION OF SWITCHING TO A STATE BASED SINGLE PAYER OPTION WHILE STILL GETTING MEDICARE BENEFITS THAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR. AND AS YOU ALL KNOW MEDICARE IS A FEDERAL PROGRAM SO CALIFORNIA WOULD HAVE TO BE HAVE TO CONSIDER WHETHER THIS IS FEASIBLE FROM A FEDERAL PERSPECTIVE. SIMILAR SET OF QUESTIONS ARISE FOR THE THIRTEEN MILLION PEOPLE IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS BE INCLUDED IN A STATE BASED SINGLE PAYER OPTION OR ANOTHER UNIVERSAL COVERAGE PROPOSAL. AND HOW ABOUT INDIVIDUALS RECEIVE HEALTH INSURANCE THROUGH SELF INSURED EMPLOYERS. WHAT IS A FEASIBILITY OF MOVING THESE EMPLOYEES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS TO A STATE BASED PROGRAM? DOES THE STATE HAVE THE CURRENT AUTHORITIES AND LEVERS TO MAKE THESE CHANGES. AS I MENTION OTHERS SPEAKERS WILL GET INTO MEDICARE MEDICARE MEDICAID ALL THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OR ERISA. AND FEDERAL WAIVERS AND AUTHORITIES IN MUCH MORE DETAIL. BUT I DID WANT TO POINT OUT POINT THESE OUT AS KEY FUNDAMENTAL FIRST ORDER FEASIBILITY QUESTIONS THAT REALLY HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED. WHEN THINKING ABOUT A COMPREHENSIVE WIDE REACHING POLICIES SUCH A SINGLE PAYER. ANOTHER QUESTION IS. THAT HAS TO DO WITH BENEFITS. WHAT BENEFITS WOULD BE COVERED UNDER SAY SINGLE PAYER OPTON OR SOME OTHER UNIVERSAL COVERAGE OPTION? FOR EXAMPLE WOULD BE ESSENTIALLY ADOPT ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS WHICH IS THE MINIMUM FLOOR THAT'S LAID OUT BY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. OR WOULD IT BE ON MEDI CAL WOULD THE MEDI CAL BENEFITS BE THE RIGHT SET OF BENEFITS. WHAT'S IT COST FOR THE TOTAL BENEFIT PACKAGE. WHAT ABOUT? SPECIFIC BUT BENEFITS SUCH AS DENTAL CARE FOR ADULTS WITHOUT BEING CLINTON. HOW ABOUT NUTRITIONAL COUNSELING OR NON EMERGENCY TRANSPORTATION? AND THEN WHAT ABOUT COST SHARING WITH THEIR BE PAYMENTS AT THE POINT OF SERVICE. AND IF SO HOW MUCH. WOULD EVERYONE BE CHARGES SAME AMOUNT. OR WOULD BE BASED ON INCOME. SO THESE ARE AGAIN BIG BIG PICTURE QUESTIONS THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED FROM IMPLEMENTATION PERSPECTIVE. AND OF COURSE THE NEXT BIG QUESTION IS HOW WILL IT BE PAID FOR. THERE IS UNCERTAINTY REGARDING WHETHER AND HOW DOLLARS A AND AND WHETHER. DOLLARS A CALIFORNIA RECEIVES THROUGH FEDERAL CHANNELS CAN REALLY BE REDISTRIBUTED TO SOME KIND OF CENTRALIZED CALIFORNIA BASED FUND. AND THESE ARE BIG POLICY CONSIDERATIONS THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE. BROUGHT UP AND DISCUSSED WITH THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. A AGAIN TO THE EXTENT THAT SELF INSURED EMPLOYERS ARE IN THE MIX. RISA WOULD VERY WELL BE A CONCERN. WAIVERS UNDER THE ACA MEDICARE AND MEDICAID AGAIN MAYBE A PATH FOR OBTAINING SOME OF APPROPRIATE PERMISSIONS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ON AND TO SEE WHETHER CALIFORNIA COULD STILL RECEIVE. SOME NECESSARY FUNDS FOR FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BUT REALLY THOSE PATS DEPEND ON THE SCOPE OF THE POLICY APPROACH. SO ARE SPEAKERS TODAY WILL AGAIN FOCUS MORE ONEROUS AND MEDICARE MEDICAID AND THE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES AND AND WAIVERS IN MORE DETAIL BUT I DID FIND A. T. THOSE UP AND THOSE ARE JUST A FEDERAL CONSIDERATIONS. THEY'RE ALSO STATE CONSIDERATIONS THAT AFFECT HOW THE WEATHER THE PROGRAM WOULD HAVE SAID. FUNDS. SO AS YOU ALL VERY WELL KNOWN UNLIKE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STATES CANNOT OPERATE WITH THE BUDGET DEFICIT. SO IF THE STATE WERE TO CONSIDER A COMPREHENSIVE POLICY APPROACH SUCH A SINGLE PAYER. IT'S IMPORTED MAKE SURE THERE'S ENOUGH MONEY TO SUPPORT IT. ENSURING THAT THE REVENUE TRENDS KEEP PACE WILL HEALTHCARE COST TRENDS IS ILLEGITIMATE AND FUNDAMENTAL CONCERN. SO HOT SO HOW WE ARE MAKING SURE TO COLLECT ENOUGH FROM YOU TO SUPPORT A NEW PROGRAM ISRAELI. ON IS REALLY A FIRST ORDER QUESTION. ANOTHER A QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH STATE CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS WHICH WAS TOUCHED ON EARLIER BY IN THE OPENING REMARKS. YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS FROM THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET POLICY CENTER BUT THERE ARE BURGEONING RULES REGARDING ALLOCATION OF STATE TROUGH FUNDS TO K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION. SO THIS MEANS INCREASES TO THE GENERAL FUNDS THROUGH TAXATION COULD TRIGGER THESE REQUIREMENTS. THIS ISN'T IMPORTANT FEASIBILITY CONSIDERATION WHEN THINKING ABOUT ANY PROPOSAL THAT'S RELYING ON. GENERATING ENOUGH TAX REVENUE THAT WOULD THEN AFFECT THE GENERAL FUNDS. SO. I WOULD LIKE TO GET INTO NEXT TO A SET OF DESIGN QUESTIONS SO WE FIRST HAD FIRST ORDER QUESTIONS ARE REALLY ARE IMPORTANT FEASIBILITY QUESTIONS AND NOW WE'RE GETTING INTO A NEXT LEVEL OF QUESTIONS I. DO HAVE TO DO WITH IMPLEMENTATION BUT REALLY ARE FROM A DESIGN PERSPECTIVE. SO IF WE WERE STARTING FROM SCRATCH. CIRCUS IN DESIGNING A NEW PROGRAM THESE ARE. THEY KEY DESIGN QUESTIONS THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF THE IMPLEMENTATION PHASE. SO STARTING WITH THE FIRST BULLET. HOW WOULD A SINGLE PAYER PROGRAM ARRANGE FOR HEALTH CARE SERVICES? WITH THE SYSTEM USE INTERMEDIARIES SUCH AS HELP PLANTS. OR WOULD PROVIDERS OF BE PAID DIRECTLY THROUGH SOME STATE BASED ADMINISTERED ENTITY. ON JUST USE A COVER CALIFORNIA'S AN EXAMPLE SINCE I WAS A PROGRAM THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN MORE RECENT YEARS. THEY HAD TO THINK THROUGH THIS AS A DESIGN QUESTION AND THEY DECIDED TO GO AHEAD OF CONTRACT WITH HEALTH PLANS IN THE STATE. TO OFFER COVERAGE AND PAY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES. SO THAT'S ONE MODEL HOW YOU ARRANGE TO PAY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES WHETHER YOU'D USE INTERMEDIARIES SUCH AS HEALTH PLANS ARE PAID DIRECT PAY PROVIDERS PHYSICIANS DOCTORS. HOSPITALS DIRECTLY IS UP A KEY FUNDAMENTAL DESIGN QUESTION. THE SECOND QUESTION IS REGARDING ADEQUACY OF PAYMENT. HOW MUCH SHOULD DOCTORS HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS GET PAID FOR THE SERVICES THEY RENDER? HOW WOULD YOU SAID THAT PAYMENT AMOUNT TO MAKE SHIRTS ADEQUATE? WOULD PAYMENTS BE TIED TO SAY FOR EXAMPLE IN EXISTING FEE SCHEDULE SUCH AS THE MEDICARE FEE SCHEDULES OR SOME OTHER MECHANISM. SENDING THE APPROPRIATE PAYMENT AMOUNT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR PROVIDERS PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM IS IMPORTANT. AND ONE CONSIDERING PAN POLICIES IT'S ALSO PRIME TO ENSURE THAT PAYMENT POLICIES AND. ENCOURAGE APPROPRIATE HEALTH CARE USE. I THINK WE ALL KNOW FROM A TRADITIONAL FEE FOR SERVICE PAYMENTS THAT ON IT JUDICIAL P. FOR SERVICE PAYMENTS REALLY PAY PROVIDERS ON A PER SERVICE BASIS. AND THAT PAYMENT SYSTEM TENDS TOWARD MORE USE AND MORE VOLUME. AND MORE IS NOT NECESSARILY BETTER AND CAN DRIVE UP HEALTHCARE COSTS. SO THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THERE'S BEEN A MOVEMENT BY PUBLIC PAYERS AS WELL PRIVATE PAYERS SHIRLEY TYPE PAYMENT TO VALUE. OR QUALITY AND TO ENSURE BETTER HEALTH A TO ENCOURAGE RATHER BETTER HEALTH HEALTH OUTCOMES AND BETTER EFFICIENCIES. AND JUST TO CONTINUE USING COVERED CALIFORNIA AS AN EXAMPLE IN THEIR PROCUREMENT PROCESS THEY ENCOURAGE ON PAYMENT METHODS THAT ARE ALTERNATE ALTERNATIVE FROM FEE FOR SERVICE MODELS. SO FOR EXAMPLE THEY ENCOURAGE OF PAYERS TO CONSIDER. ON VALUE BASED PAYMENTS ON AS PART OF THEIR PROCUREMENT PROCESS. SO THE WAY PAYMENT SYSTEMS ARE DESIGNED IS AN IMPORTANT DESIGN CONSIDERATION. THE OTHER IS A PROVIDER PARTICIPATION I ALREADY MENTIONED THAT PAYMENT ADEQUACY IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT STE. POSITIONS REALLY PARTICIPATE IN THE IN THE PROGRAM. BUT HOW WOULD A. THIS HOW WOULD POSITION PARTICIPATION WORK SAY IN A TRUE SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM. IF YOU REALLY JUST HAVE A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM WITH NO WHETHER PAIRS WELL YOU'D HAVE TO INCLUDE ALL PHYSICIANS PRACTICING IN THE STATE. OTHERWISE HE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SEE PATIENTS BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE NO OTHER PAYERS THEORETICALLY. SO A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM WOULD HAVE TO REALLY ALLOW ANY WILLING PROVIDER TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SYSTEM. SO THIS RAISES A A KEY QUESTION ABOUT QUALITY AND HOW A SINGLES PAYER SYSTEM CURRENTLY MAKE SURE THE PATIENTS ARE REALLY GETTING QUALITY CARE. FOR THEIR PATIENTS. SO AGAIN JUST TO CONTINUE USING COVERED CALIFORNIA AS AN EXAMPLE. COVERED CALIFORNIA DECIDERS OKAY TO BE SELECTIVE ABOUT WHICH PROVIDERS. PAGE IN THEIR NETWORKS AS LONG AS THEY'RE SUFFICIENT ACCESS. SO THIS WAS THE DESIGN CHOICE THAT WAS MADE AND IT WAS MADE TWO ENCOURAGE THE USE OF HIGH VALUE. NETWORKS OR HIGH QUALITY LOW COST. THIS IS AN HEALTH SYSTEMS. SO PROVIDER PARTICIPATION AS WELL AS A QUALITY OF CARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROVIDERS IS REALLY AN IMPORTANT DESIGN QUESTION. THE NEXT IS A CONSUMER PARTICIPATION AND I HAVE. TOUCH ON THIS ALREADY THOSE A BIG IMPLEMENTATION QUESTION ABOUT FIGURING OUT YOU KNOW WHO'S IN AND WHO'S OUT. AND IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING THIS FROM A SINGLE PAYER APPROACH WHICH INCLUDES ALL CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. AND THERE'S STILL SOME ELIGIBILITY QUESTIONS TO SORT pOUT. SO FOR EXAMPLE WHAT IS BEING A RESIDENT MEAN. WITH THIS INCLUDE SOMEONE WHO SAY FOR UP WITH. WAS SO IF YOU'RE ON DECIDING THAT EVERYONE THAT IS A RESIDENT IS INCLUDED. YOU HAVE JUST DEFINED RESIDENCY. WOOD ON A PERSON WHO'S. LIVED IN THE STATE FOR A FEW MONTHS BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM. WHAT ABOUT SOMEONE WHO WORKS IN THE STATE OUR LIVES ELSEWHERE? SO USES EXAMPLES OF ELIGIBILITY QUESTIONS THAT HAVE TO BE SORTED OUT. ON ALREADY TOUCHED ON COVERED BENEFITS AND SERVICES SO I WILL ON. WON'T REPEAT THAT. I DO WANT TO TOUCH ON GOVERNANCE AND ADMINISTRATION. SETTING UP A SOUND GOVERNANCE MODEL IS REALLY IMPORTANT. US SOUND GOVERNANCE MODEL PROMOTES ACCOUNTABILITY EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT. AND EVIDENCE BASED DATA DRIVEN APPROACH TO IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT. IT ALSO ENCOURAGES CONSUMER AND STAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATION AS WELL AS TRANSPARENCY. SO IF WE WERE STARTING FROM SCRATCH CONCERNING NEW PROGRAMS SUCH AS SINGLE PAYER. THEN WE NEED TO THINK THROUGH HOW THE PROGRAM WOULD BE GOVERNED AND BY WHOM. WOULD THERE BE A NEW BOARD. WOULD BE ADMINISTERED BY AN EXISTINGAGENCY OR NEW AGENCY. AND AGAIN JUST USE COVERED CALIFORNIA JUST EXAMPLE. OF THE STATE AT THAT POINT WHEN IMPLEMENTING THAT PROGRAM DECIDE TO ESTABLISH A NEW BOARD TO OVERSEE THE EXCHANGE AND SET THE DIRECTION FOR THE PROGRAM. AGAIN THAT WAS ONE DESIGN CHOICE THAT WAS MADE. ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS ALSO NEED TO BE HANDLED BY SOME ENTITY. IF WE WERE TO CONSIDER A SINGLE PAYER PROGRAM THAT CENTRALLY ADMINISTERED WHAT ARE THE FUNCTIONS THAT WOULD. NEED TO BE ARRANGED FOR A NEED TO. CONTINUE TO OCCUR. FOR EXAMPLE. ASSED A STATE ADMINISTERED AGENCY OR CENTRALLY ADMINISTERED INTERCEDING WOULD HAVE TO. PAY DOCTORS HOSPITALS AND PROVIDERS FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES WE NEED TO PAY FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. IT WOULD NEED TO ENSURE THE PAYMENTS ARE ACCURATE AND THE NEED TO WATCH OUT FOR FRAUD AND ABUSE. FINANCIAL AN ACTUARIAL ANNOUNCES TO ESTIMATE BUDGET IMPACTS WOULD ALSO BE NECESSARY. WE'D ALSO NEED THE FUNCTIONS OF ANALYTICS TO TO TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY'RE SUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF PRIMARY AND SPECIALTY CARE SERVICES AND TO ASSESS WHETHER PATRONS ARE REALLY GETTING APPROPRIATE CARE WHEN THEY NEED IT. MANY OF THESE FUNCTIONS ARE ADMINISTERED CURRENTLY IN PUBLIC BY MULTIPLE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PAYERS. SO IN A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM THESE FUNCTIONS DON'T NECESSARILY GO AWAY BUT THERE'S POTENTIAL FOR REDUCTION OF THAT DUPLICATION ACROSS PAYERS AND SYSTEMS. IN THE TRANSITION HOWEVER THESE FUNCTIONS WOULD HAVE TO BE STOOD UP AND SOME CONSCIOUS DELIBERATE FASHION. SO A LAID OUT ON A LOT OF IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND IT'S QUITE A LOT OF INFORMATION SO I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH SOME KIND OF FRAMEWORK TO EVALUATE. DIFFERENT FOR PROPOSALS THAT YOU MAY BE CONSIDERING IN THE NEAR FUTURE. SO ON THIS SLIDE HERE IS A A SUGGESTED FRAMEWORK. ON AND AND WHAT IT DOES IS I YOU SEE ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE. OWN I'VE LAID OUT. SUGGEST YOUR CRITERIA TO CONSIDER WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AND EVALUATING BEARS POLICY PROPOSALS. SO IN YOU'D BE EVALUATING POLICY PROPOSALS AGAINST THE STATUS QUO WHAT WE HAVE NOW. AND AGAINST EACH OTHER. AND OF THESE CRITERIA CHRIS COULD BE TWEAKED BASED ON YOUR OVERALL POLICY GOALS. SO IT'LL BE HELPFUL JUST TO TAKE A COUPLE MINUTES TO WALK THROUGH EACH ONE. A FIRST OF ALL IS COVERAGE HOW MANY ADDITIONAL AND INFO INDIVIDUALS WERE ARE CURRENTLY UNINSURED WOULD GAIN ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE. AND THE SECOND IS SOMETHING WE CALL UP IN CALLING A DISRUPTION INDEX HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS WHO CURRENTLY HAVE SOME KIND OF COVERAGE. WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE THEIR PLANS. THE THIRD IS SYSTEM WIDE COSTS. WHAT IS A PROJECTED IMPACT ON TOTAL HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURES AND WE'RE LOOKING AT TOLL HELP HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES OF COURSES? IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THAT IS PART OF. THE TOTAL HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES. THE FOR THIS PAYMENT FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES. SPECIFICALLY OBJECT IMPACTS ON THE REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS FOR DOCTORS HOSPITALS AND OTHER PROVIDERS IN THE STATE. WHAT ABOUT AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES? DOES A POLICY IMPACT ACCESS TO CARE IN ANYWAY WOULD IMPROVE IT HER WOULD EXACERBATE ANY HEALTH CARE ACCESS ISSUES. THE NEXUS QUALITY. WITH THE PROPOSAL HAVE ANY PROVISIONS RELATED TO SAFETY AND QUALITY. WOULD IT ENCOURAGE USE OF PRIMARY CARE OR PREVENTIVE SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE ENCOURAGING USE OF CANCER SCREENINGS AND PREVENTIVE SERVICES THAT MIGHT PREVENT. FUTURE HEALTHCARE COSTS. HELD UP FINANCIAL BARRIERS. SEARCHES CO PAYMENTS OR MONTHLY PAYMENTS IN THE FORM OF PREMIUMS. THOSE COULD POSE REAL BARRIERS TO LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS SO THAT IS CERTAINLY A CRITERIA. THAT THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. THE NEXT OR POTENTIAL DOWNSTREAM EFFECTS SUCH AS THOSE. THAT MIGHT. AFFECT THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE AND INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE AND HELP HER WORKFORCE PIPELINE. THE NEXT ONE IS A THAT I'VE LISTED IS INVESTMENTS IN SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH CARE. SO THE QUESTION THERE AS DOES A PROPOSAL ENCOURAGE OUR SYSTEM TO REALLY LOOK AT A PERSON AS A WHOLE. INCLUDING ALTHOUGH SOCIO ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT AFFECT HEALTH AND WELL BEING. SUCH AS HOUSING AND FOOD SECURITY. AND OF COURSE LAST ONE IS FEASIBILITY. WHAT IS TRULY FEASIBLE AGAIN FROM A FEDERAL PERSPECTIVE AND FROM A STATE PERSPECTIVE? AND IN TERMS OF VISIBILITY CAN WE OBTAIN THE SUFFICIENT DOLLARS AND GENERATE SUFFICIENT REVENUES TO ESTABLISH AND SUSTAIN THE PROGRAM. AND WHAT IS FEASIBLE FROM A STATE CONSTITUTION AND THE BUDGETING RULES PURSE. SO THIS THIS LAST SLIDE HERE IS REALLY INTENDED TO SHOW HOW SUCH A FRAMEWORK CONSISTS COMPLETELY HYPOTHETICAL HERE. BUT HOW SUCH A FRAMEWORK COULD BE APPLIED. SO I A HYPOTHETICAL OPTION NUMBER ONE HYPOTHETICAL OPTION NUMBER TWO. AND AGAIN THIS IS JUST TO SHOW HOW IT GOT THE CRITERIA AND ONCE YOU'VE ANALYZE EACH OF THE OPTIONS HOW THEY FARED AGAINST EACH OTHER AND AGAINST THE STATUS QUO. SO WHEN LOOKING AT YOU PROPOSALS ANALYSTS COULD TAKE A LOOK AT EACH CRITERIA. AND THEN. SEE HOW THEY DID FOR EACH OF THE SPECIFIC CRITERIA. IN THIS ONE IT LOOKS LIKE HYPOTHETICAL OPTION NUMBER ONE IT MAY INCREASE COVERAGE. BY BY A LOT. BUT IN MAY BE DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT. DO A FEASIBILITY DUE TO BEARS A FEASIBILITY. HYPOTHETICAL OPTION TWO MIGHT BE MORE INCREMENTAL IN ITS APPROACH. AND MIGHT BE MORE FEASIBLE BUT MAY ONLY RESULT IN A SMALL INCREASE OF COVERAGE. SO THE JUST ONE WAY FOR YOU TO WELL. COMPARE VARIOUS PROPOSALS THAT YOU MIGHT BE CONSIDERING IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AND MONTHS. SO. SERB THEIR OWN LIKE THAT THAT ACTUALLY CONCLUDES MY REMARKS SO. YOU TAKE QUESTIONS NOW OR. YEAH ACTUALLY AND WE WILL TAKE QUESTIONS FOR YOU AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO OUR THE REST FOR PANEL SO QUESTION. FOR SUSAN. IN MANY OF YOURS YOU'RE COMPARING THE STATUS QUO TO POTENTIAL OPTIONS I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD COMMENT ON THE STATUS QUO. AND TO DESCRIBE SOME OF THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES THAT WE CURRENTLY FACE TO. HOPEFULLY INSPIRE US TO WANT TO CHANGE. RIGHT SO. CERTAINLY. I'D I THINK THE FIRST REMARK THAT I MADE ABOUT HOW. ON THE YOU KNOW AND ON A NOTE OF OPTIMISM IS THAT WE HAVE MADE QUITE A LOT OF PROGRESS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. TO BOMB EXPAND COVERAGE AND REDUCE THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED. SO ON BUT THERE'S STILL DOES REMAIN QUITE A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO ENSURE THAT THE LIVE REMAINING THREE MILLION ARE IN FACT HAVE SOME SORT OF COVERAGE. AND OF COURSE OUR SYSTEM DOES HAVE ISSUES IN TERMS OF OF FRAGMENTATION. ON THE VARIATION IN QUALITY OF HEALTH CARE. AFFORDABILITY AND THESE ARE STILL ONGOING CONCERNS. SO ON YES SO THE STATUS QUO STILL HAS ITS ISSUES AND THERE'S DEFINITELY QUITE A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE. YOU. MY QUESTION IS. WREAK REGARDING YOUR YOUR FRAMEWORK TO DO AND GO BACK IN THE. THE PREVIOUS SLIDE IF YOU DON'T MIND. SO OF THOSE MEAN YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF THINGS AARON WHAT WOULD YOU CONSIDER TO BE. THE MOST CRITICAL OF THOSE OR OR HAVE YOU GIVEN THAT. MUCH CONSIDERATION. WELL I AM I I THINK IT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR. IN TERMS OF SETTING POLICY GOALS FOR APOLLO FOR POLICYMAKERS WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE ROADMAP AND WHERE YOU WANT TO BE. AND. WHATEVER YOU SET YOUR CRITERIA TO BE SHOULD MATCH THE GOALS I DO THINK THAT COVERAGE IS PROBABLY. ONE THAT IT IS ONE OF THOSE THAT. MIGHT BE ONE TO PUT UP THERE AND OF COURSE FEASIBILITY. IF IF IT'S NOT FEASIBLE THEN THAT'S OBVIOUSLY. UP AND ISSUE SO. ON THOSE ARE A COUPLE THAT I WOULD PUT UP THERE. DIVERT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE'RE GOING TO SHIFT AROUND THE ORDER A LITTLE BIT FOR THE THREE FUTURE I THINK GUARDINO THAT. SO. I TWO ONE. GONNA GO AHEAD AND INTRODUCE A. AND AND MARIE. MARCIA RALLY HOPE WE GOT THAT WE GOT THAT RIGHT PROFESSOR OF LAW UNIVERSITY OF MATT MISSOURI. KANSAS CITY. UM'S SHE SPECIALIZES IN HEALTH CARE LAW AND SHE'S GOING TO BE. TALKING TO US ABOUT A RECESS. IN A MOMENT. AND AFTER YOUR PRESENTATION HENRY WE WILL ASK QUESTIONS SO THAT WE MAKE. AND THEN WILL WAIT ON THE OTHER TO AYE AYE AND YOU OTHER TWO PANELISTS ASK QUESTIONS IF YOU BOTH PRESENTED SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE SHE. WELL ISN'T STUCK IN CALIFORNIA FOR ANOTHER DAY OR MINE WHEN HE SAID IT WOULD BE STUCK IN ANYWAY UP A LONGTIME RESIDENT BEFORE I MOVED TO. KANSAS CITY TO BECOME A FULL TIME TENURED FULL PROFESSOR. AT THE LAW SCHOOL THERE AND SO REMAIN DEEPLY INTERESTED. AND INVESTED I THINK AND. CALIFORNIA'S ACTIVITY IN THIS AREA. SO MY TOPIC TODAY IS THE IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATION OF ARRESTS OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR I ALWAYS TELL MY STUDENTS WILL NEVER HEAR ME SAY IT THAT WAY AGAIN. WHAT A MOUTHFUL? SO WHAT IS A WRESTLER. ALRIGHT. IT'S A FEDERAL LAW OKAY AND WE ARE IN THE LAND OF MY FOR YOUR SPONSORED HEALTH INSURANCE WE ARE NOT IN THE LAND OF MEDICARE AND MEDICAID. FOR MY REMARKS. RIGHT. INNOCENTLY REGULATES PRIVATE SECTOR WHAT WE'VE BEEN CALL COMMERCIAL SECTOR PENSIONS AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PROGRAMS INCLUDING JOB BASED HEALTH COVERAGE WHY AM I TELLING YOU HISTORY. IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY SIGNIFICANT ONE EXPLAINED TO YOU THAT MUCH OF THE INTERPRETATION OF A RISA HAS RESTED WITH THE COURTS. PART OF THE REASON IS THE HISTORY OF HOW THE SAUSAGE BUT MADE US LEGISLATORS I HOPE YOU WILL BE ALTERNATELY HORRIFIED AND AMUSED. THAT MAY TELL YOU A TALE OF ORISSA. OKAY RISA WAS PASSED BY THE CONGRESS IN THE WANING DAYS OF THE NIXON ADMINISTRATION YES THERE ARE ACTUAL TRANSCRIPTS OF TAPES OF. ON. FORMER PRESIDENT NIXON JUST BEFORE HIS RESIGNATION TALKING ABOUT WE SHOULD MOVE THIS ALONG WILL DISTRACT PEOPLE. WE KNOW THE REST OF THE STORY IT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW BY BEEN PRESIDENT FORD. RIGHT NOW RISA HAD BEEN A MORNIN SINCE ACTUALLY THE NINETEEN. WHEN IT WAS PRIMARILY A PENSION BILL THOSE OF YOU OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER THE STUDEBAKER AUTOMOTIVE COMPANIES. KNOW THAT IT'S TALE OF WOE ITS DISSOLUTION ITS ULTIMATE BANKRUPTCY AND YET MORE TRAGICALLY THE BANKRUPTCY IT TURNS OUT OF ITS ENTIRE EMPLOYEE. RETIREMENT FUND. LEFT WHAT WE USED TO CALL WHEN I WORKED IN A THE PENSION AREA THE STUDEBAKER PEOPLE WHO WAS ALSO TALKING ABOUT LIKE A VAMPIRE ó IS TO THE BIG A PERSON IS IN THE WAITING ROOM. AND YOU KNOW THAT WAS A PERSON WHO HAD ABSOLUTELY NO RETIREMENT INCOME AFTER ENTIRE. SUPPOSEDLY VESTED CAREER WHICH STUDEBAKER AUTOMOTIVE. OKAY THE TRAGEDY OF THIS PEOPLE WHICH WAS WRITTEN LARGE ACROSS ALL OF AMERICANS NEWSPAPER. OKAY AND TELEVISION PROGRAM IS ACTUALLY WHAT GENERATED THE PUSH FIRST WITH PRESIDENT KENNEDY AND THEN FORD ON A PENSION REFORM BILL. WYMAN TALKING ABOUT A PENSION REFORM BILL BECAUSE HEALTH BENEFITS WERE ADDED THIS FLOOR AMENDMENT. TO A PENSION REFORM BILL. OKAY. AND THIS EXPLAINS WHY THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY IS QUITE BEEN. IT ALSO EXPLAINS WHY. SPRING COURT HAS BEEN CALLED UPON SO MANY TIMES TO EXPLAIN WHAT THE BILL MEANS WHAT THE LANGUAGE OF THE STATUTE MEANS SINCE THERE'S. RELATIVELY FAMILY LOOKING AGAIN THIS MORNING FOR PRINTED VOLUMES OF THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF ARRESTS AND THE CONGRESS. SCARCELY A MENTION OF HEALTH. BUT THEY USED TO CALL. AND QUICKTIME'S NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE HOSPITALIZATION COVERAGE OKAY BUT WHAT THEY MEANT WAS HEALTH INSURANCE OFFERED BY EMPLOYERS. ALRIGHT SO IT'S RELEVANT BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A LATE ADDITION I THINK WE COULD AGREE NOW AYE AYE I THINK IF I WERE TO CUENTA PHRASE WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE AMENDED HASTE REPENT AT LEISURE. OKAY WE PUT IT IN THERE WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT IT MEANT WE'VE RELIED ON THE SUPREME COURT OKAY TO EXPLAIN TO US AND IT'S LIKE THAT'S WHAT THAT MEANT. AND IN SOME WAYS AN UNHAPPY THAT'S WHAT THAT MEANS IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT THE FORTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE REST OF THE CONFERENCE. TO LOOK BACK AT IT AMONG ALL THE SORT OF BIGGER RISK GEEKS WAS CALLED THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR WHAT WERE THEY THINKING. AND I PERSONALLY THOUGHT I WISH I HAD NAMED IT. IT'S BRILLIANT. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING I DON'T THINK WE'LL EVER KNOW? OKAY WHAT WE KNOW NOW IS WHAT THE SUPREME COURT. ALRIGHT AND THEN FINALLY RESEARCH IS RELEVANT TO HEALTH POLICY BECAUSE IT PREMIUMS THE WORD OF THE DAY ALRIGHT STATE LAWS THAT RELATE TO EMPLOYEE PLANS. PUSHES ALL THE AIR OUT OF THE ROOM IS THE WAY I DESCRIBE IT. IF YOU WANT AIR IN THE ROOM TO DO SOMETHING ELSE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ARGUE YOU LEFT OF SOME HERE. OKAY HOW BY NOT SUCKING IT ALL OUT TO CONGRESS. FEDERAL PREEMPTION IS THE DOCTRINE MUCH BIGGER THAN EVER SET A MUCH BIGGER THAN HEALTH CARE THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE ATTORNEYS THAT ASSERTS THAT WHEN A STATE LAW AND FEDERAL LAW CONFLICT. FEDERAL LAW DISPLACES OR PREEMPT STATE LAW ARM ESSENTIALLY A UNDER THE SUPERCENTER SUPREMACY CLAUSE OF THE. XIN WHICH IS OF COURSE. ARTICLE SIX SECTION TWO. IT MOVE EVEREST IS ADMINISTERED. IT'S DIVISION IT'S ADMINISTRATIONS DIVIDED AMONG THREE ENTITIES AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND ACTUALLY THE PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY. OPERATION IF YOU THINK OF IT AS PRIMARILY AS A GOAL WHICH WAS TO CREATE WHAT. FIDUCIARY DUTIES IN PENSION PLAN ADMINISTRATORS JUST THINK STUDEBAKER PEOPLE AND YOU'LL THINK ABOUT WHY WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE RIGHT TO CREATE. RULES ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION OF PENSION PLANS THAT WOULD SAFEGUARD THOSE WHO BELIEVE THEMSELVES AND. ACCORDING TO PLAN DOCUMENTS WERE VESTED TO PROTECT THEIR RETIREMENT INCOME. OKAY IT MAKES SENSE THEN THAT IT WOULD FIT THIS WAY. BUT THAT ALSO WERE HEALTH. BENEFITS DIDN'T AS WELL THEY'RE CONSIDERED AN EMPLOYEE WELFARE. BENEFIT. ALRIGHT. SO I GOT A LOT OF CALLS ON THE DAY AFTER A OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW SO SUNLAND MARCH TWENTY THIRD TWENTY TEN FROM PEOPLE WHO KNOW THAT I'M. A SOMETHING OF INTEREST SO. GEEK IN THE CITY DID WE JUST PEEL APPEAL REPEAL LARISSA AND WHAT NOT. OKAY WE AMENDED IT IN SOME WAYS WE ACTUALLY CREATED SOME EXEMPTIONS TO IT IN OTHER WAYS. BUT THERE ARE ACTUALLY SPECIFIC PROVISIONS IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHICH FILE. TOURISTS AND I THOUGHT THAT'S WORTH POINTING OUT TO YOU OKAY SOMETIMES IT'S DESCRIBED AS IN ON EASY RELATIONSHIP WE COULD SAY THAT THE TWO STATUTES MIGHT. BE SEEN AS NOT PERFECTLY DOVE TAILING MIGHT BE A WAY TO PUT IT. OKAY SO. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN AS A PRACTICAL MATTER THAT MEANS THAT? IT DID AMENDED SO THAT THERE ARE RULES RELATING TO THE PROHIBITION OF PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS THAT PROHIBIT LIFETIME AND ANNUAL DOLLAR LIMITS FOR ESSENTIAL BENEFITS. SOME RESTRAINTS ON RECISIONS OF INSURANCE POLICIES ON RECORD COVERED STANDARDS BUT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT WERE NOT CHANGED THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE EVER WONDERED WHY. IT MATTERS WHETHER OR NOT SOMETHING IS INTEREST QUALIFY PLAN WHETHER OR NOT THE MINIMUM ESSENTIAL BENEFIT STANDARD APPLIES THAT'S A RISK. pORISSA. DIVIDING ALL EMPLOYER SPONSORED HEALTH INSURANCE. WHO SETS? OKAY THOSE THAT WILL RECEIVE THE MINIMUM ESSENTIAL BENEFITS REQUIREMENT AND THOSE THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF IT AND EXEMPT FROM IT. SO THE MOST RELEVANT QUESTION YOU CAN ASK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THE MINIMUM ESSENTIAL BENEFIT STANDARD IS. US INTERESTS. QUALIFY PLAN. THE MINIMUM ESSENTIAL BENEFIT REQUIREMENTS DO NOT APPLY. TO A SELF FUNDED PLAN SO I THOUGHT MAYBE I SHOULD SAY A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT. WHAT THAT IS? OKAY. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FULLY INSURED AND A SELF INSURED HEALTH PLAN SO OFTEN HEARD SURE TO HEALTH PLAN IS WHERE AN UNSURE WHERE AN EMPLOYER TYPICALLY. VERY LARGE EMPLOYER BUT INCREASINGLY CREEPING DOWN WHEN I SAY VERY LARGE I MEAN FIVE HUNDRED PLUS. EMPLOYEES. BUT CREEPING DOWN. FOR REASONS WILL DISCUSS IN A SECOND. ASSUME RISK. THEY FUNCTION AS THEIR OWN HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY. WHEN I SAY ASSUME RISK THAT MEANS THEY HAVEN'T SHIFTED THE RISK. OKAY OF EXTRAORDINARY HEALTHCARE COSTS. PERHAPS SHOWING UP IN THEIR POPULATION RIGHT IN THEIR RISK POOL ON TO ANYONE ELSE. THE ONLY WAY THEY KIND OF STRATEGIZE AROUND AS A BY PRODUCT CALLED STOP LOSS INSURANCE WHICH IS JUST WHAT AT TIMES LIKE. RIGHT AND SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT OF BECAUSE THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS GIVEN SOME THOUGHT. TO CHANGING CALIFORNIA LAW AND STOP LOSS INSURANCE NEW YORK HAS JUST CHANGED ITS LAW I BELIEVE WISCONSIN AS WELL. ALRIGHT SO STOP LOSS INSURANCE IS LIKE A STOP GAP RIGHT IN CASE THE MAN WITH THE ACTUAL SKULL AS WE SAY LAW SCHOOL SHOWS UP IN YOUR. IN YOUR RISK POOL OTHER THAN THAT YOU'RE FUNCTIONING AS YOUR OWN RISK PARA. EMPLOYEES DO NOT KNOW THAT THIS IS HOW IT IS WORKING BECAUSE YOU HIRE AN INSURANCE COMPANY JUST TO ADMINISTER THE BENEFITS AND THEY PUT OUT A CARD THAT LOOKS JUST LIKE AN INSURANCE CARD. THAT THEY WOULD PUT OUT IF THEY WERE RUNNING THE INSURANCE PROGRAM IT WILL SAY LIKE. AETNA ON IT SO TYPICALLY EMPLOYEES HAVE NO IDEA. BUT THIS IS WHAT THEY HAVE AND THEN EXPLAIN TO ME HOW THEY FIND OUT IN A MINUTE. THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IS THAT SO EMPLOYER COULD CHOOSE TO ESSENTIALLY CONTRACT WITH INSURANCE. RIGHT BIG RISK GOES TO THE INSURANCE COMPANY EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THAT RIGHT IF I HAVE THE MAN WITH THE ACTUAL SCRAWL. AND HIS WIFE AN OLDER LITTLE EGGSHELL CHILDREN RIGHT AND THE ONLY ONE HUMPTY DUMPTY REPLACEMENTS OKAY. IN THE NEXT YOU KNOW FISCAL QUARTER WHATEVER THE RISK IS ON YOU. INSURANCE COMPANY RAY I'M NOT TAKING THAT RISK YOU TOOK THAT RISK OKAY WHEN YOU WROTE THE POLICY OR THE CONTRACT WITH ME. NOW THE DIFFERENCES IS THAT RISA PUTS OUTSIDE OF REGULATION THE ONE THAT'S CALLED SELF INSURED. OUTSIDE OF WHAT KIND OF REGULATION ESSENTIALLY OUTSIDE OF STATE REGULATION. ALL THOSE REGULATIONS A CANNON REQUIRED BENEFITS SPECIFIC BENEFITS BE ADDED. RIGHT ALL OF THAT. SOMETIMES O. EMPLOYERS AND I KNOW YOU'LL APPRECIATE THAT DEFY TALK INSURANCE TALK IT'S BECAUSE OF OR EVEN KNOW WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE. A WILL REFER THIS TO AS REGULATORY BURDEN. ALRIGHT. AND YOU CAN IMAGINE THE BIGGEST REGULATORY BURDEN OF ALL WOULD HAVE BEEN WHAT THE MINIMUM ESSENTIAL. BENEFITS REQUIREMENTS OF THE ACA THAT IS THE LIST CONGRESS DELEGATED THE AUTHORITY. TO WHAT'S NOW CALLED WHAT THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE TO PRODUCE A LIST CONTRACEPTIVES FOR WOMEN YOU NOKIA TRICK RIGHT. POST A LIST FOR MEN WOMEN CHILDREN OF ALL THE MINIMUM ESSENTIAL BENEFITS YOU COULDN'T CALLED INSURANCE UNLESS IT. HAD AT THEIR THEIR RIGHT FOR THAT YOU COULD BUY WHAT HEALTH INSURANCE WITHOUT HOSPITALIZATION. HEALTH INSURANCE WITHOUT A DRUG. OUR HELL TO TRANSFER THEM ATTORNEY COVERAGE. RIGHT HEALTH INSURANCE WITH. LIFETIME CAP OF FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A EVERY POSSIBLE PERMUTATION WAS OUT THERE OKAY SO THE SOURCE OF THIS IS WHAT HEALTH INSURER SHOULD LOOK LIKE IMPORTED IT. YOU KNOW BE WITHIN THE PROPER TERM FOR HEALTH INSURANCE. NO SUCH RULES. ON THE A RISA. RIGHT FULLY INSURED PLANTS NOW THE VERY LARGEST EMPLOYERS CAN WE THINK BOEING FOR A MINUTE OKAY. YOU UNDERSTAND THEY MIGHT OFFER VARIOUS PRODUCTS AND SOME MIGHT BE SELF INSURED AND SOME MIGHT BE FULLY INSURED TO SO YOU'LL BE READY FOR MY ADVANCE TO RECEIVE SOME OF OUR SOMEDAY. YOU'LL IS ALSO NOT ALL EMPLOYERS ARE INTO GROUPS SOME YOU KNOW OUR FRIEND ONE FROM A ONE FROM DEEP APPLYING LARGE ITS KEEP IT SIMPLE TODAY. THE SORT OF OFF INTO GROUPS IMMACULATE WHITE SHOE TERMINUS. BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT AT LEAST FIFTY PERCENT. OF OF CALIFORNIANS. PROBABLY CLOSER TO SIXTY SEVENTY. OKAY ARE IN A GARISSA SELF INSURED COVERAGE. NUMBER I SAID IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU DON'T KNOW IT. YOU STILL ARE. ALRIGHT HOW DO YOU FIND OUT YOU FIND IT BECAUSE THE RULES ARE DIFFERENT ABOUT APPEALS ON COVERAGE LIMITATIONS OF IT A LOT LOTS AND LOTS OF WAYS YOU FIND OUT. OF SHAPE WHEN YOU NEED TO KNOW BELIEVE ME YOU FIND OUT. ALRIGHT SO WHERE DOES THAT MEAN PRACTICALLY IT MEANS THAT THERE ARE VAST NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO ALREADY ESSENTIALLY INSULATED FROM CALIFORNIA STATE REGULATION. OF THE EMPLOYER SPONSORED HEALTH INSURANCE OF THEIR IN. ALRIGHT. AYE AND THE REASON WHY THAT MATTERS IS THAT SO TO TRY AND BRING THEM BACK INSIDE THE TENT YOU SEE WOULD REQUIRE ESSENTIALLY. FLYING FULL IN THE FACE. OVERSEE. NOW THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT DID NOTHING TO BREAK UP THIS IDEA OF WE SORT. EMPLOYER SPONSORED HEALTH COVERAGE BY THESE TWO WAYS THAT'S WHY I GAVE YOU THE EXAMPLE OF THE MINIMUM ESSENTIAL BENEFITS IT BALLOTS TO. OKAY SO IT'S NOT LIKE WILL THE ACA BROKE THAT SO MAYBE WE COULD BREAK THAT TO KNOW IT DOESN'T BREAK IT AT ALL. IN MANY WAYS THE ACA IS INCREMENTAL STE COVERAGE. AND THIS IS A GOOD EXAMPLE. OKAY BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A LOT OF RATIONALITY TO THIS DIVISION ALRIGHT BUT THERE'S A LONG HISTORY. OF HONORING THIS DIVISION FOR OTHER PURPOSES. SO I AYE THOUGHT MIGHT BE INTERESTING TO LOOKS. TALK ABOUT. WHAT'S LEFT TO THE STATE. OKAY DIFFERENCE A COMES INTO THE ROOM. WHAT'S LEFT. ANY. WELL YOU THE STATE'S MAKE TAX AND REGULATE TRADITIONAL INSURERS PERFORMING TRADITIONAL INSURANCE FUNCTIONS YES I WROTE A SENTENCE WITH TRADITIONAL AND IT TWICE. BECAUSE THE CASE LAW HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE CLASSIC FUNCTIONS OF THE STATE AND RATED INSURANCE DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LICENSE TO SELL. INSURANCE IN THIS JURISDICTION TO OUR BROKERS AND AGENTS HAVE TO BE LICENSE OTHER CAPITALIZATION REQUIREMENTS WHAT ARE THAT YOU SEE THAT MOST COR. RIGHT IT I CALL IT THE BUSINESS SHARON'S AND THAT IT'S A TERM THAT GETS REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN THE CASE OF. REGULATING IT AS A BUSINESS. ALRIGHT AS A BUSINESS ENTITY. YOU CAN REGULATE MULTIPLE EMPLOYER WELFARE ARRANGEMENTS WELL WHAT ARE THOSE SAY. AMAZON. AND JP MORGAN. AND BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY WANTED TO COMBINE ALL OF THEIR COVERED LIVES ONE MILLION OR SO AND FORMA MULTI EMPLOYER HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN. IT'S MY SECOND BOOK. ALRIGHT BETTING ON HOW TO SET IT UP BUT THAT THAT'S WHERE IT WOULD REST. OKAY. REGULAR HOSPITAL RATES CHARGED TO INSURERS ANOTHER TO PAY HEALTH CARE BILLS THE CONTAX HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS YOU CAN PROVIDE REMEDIES FOR INJURIES WHEN THE HEALTH PLAN CONTROLS MEDICAL CARE DELIVERY IN OTHER WORDS. IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY TRADITIONAL MED MAL CASE YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND ONE ARREST WAS FIRST PASSED SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT IT FEDERAL EYES MET BALBOA. NEVER ACTUALLY HAD TO BE LITIGATION OVER TO TO JUST TAKE THE AUTHORITY TO HAVE DIFFERENT STANDARDS FOR MEN. YOU KNOW UP UP TO CONGRESS ALRIGHT. SO WHAT CAN'T THE STATE'S DO. BECAUSE WE'RE ALSO INTERESTED IN THE WHAT NOT TO WEAR RIGHT. CAN'T THEY DO THEY CAN'T DIRECTLY REGULATE PRIVATE EMPLOYER SPONSORED HEALTH PLANS I CANNOT SAY. YOU. MUST DO THIS WITHIN YOUR PLAN ALRIGHT THE PURPOSE OF A RISK IS WHAT TO STANDARDIZE. AND THEN ALSO I CALL IT IT'S NOT REALLY AWARE BUT SORT OF FIDUCIARY AYE. RIGHT IT'S ABOUT HAVING QUALITY ADMINISTRATION RIGHT MANDATE THAT YOU CANNOT MANDATE THE PRIVATE EMPLOYERS OFFER A PAY FOR INSURANCE. RIGHT PROBABLY CAN'T TAX PRIVATE EMPLOYER PRO CLEAR SPONSORED HEALTH PLANS THEMSELVES. AND YOU CAN'T REGULATE SELF INSURED PRIVATE EMPLOYEE BENEFITS OR FINANCIAL SOLVENCY. SO EVERYTHING AFTER THIS IS SO WE ARE ON THE LINE BETWEEN WHAT THE STATE MAY AND MAY NOT TO IS ANYTHING ANYONE WISHES TO. RIGHT IT'S ALL ABOUT ANALOGIZE DOING RIGHT IS ANALOGY MONGERING RIGHT IS IT MORE LIKE THIS ISN'T MORE LIKE THAT AND THAT'S WHERE THE CASE LOGOS AND THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT THE SUPREME COURT SPECIALIZES IN DOING IN THIS AREA. OKAY SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT A RECIPROCAL MERGE DIRECT REGULATION OF EMPLOYER SUPPLANTS BUT IT ALLOWS THE STATE REGULATION OF THE INSURANCE CARRIERS THAT PROVIDE THE COVERAGE. ALRIGHT IT ALLOWS REGULATION OF INSURANCE COVERS BUT CANNOT REACH INTO THE PLANT ITSELF. AS IF TO SAY YOU ARE AN INSURANCE PLAN WE'RE GONNA TREAT YOU LIKE AN INSURANCE PLAN NOW. THAT'S AN EMPLOYER SPONSORED. RAY BENEFITS WELFARE BENEFITS. YOU DON'T GET TO DEMINT AS THE WRESTLING WHICH GOES YOU DON'T GET TO DEMAND AN INSURANCE COMPANY. WHICH IS ACTUALLY WHAT I THINK UNDER MANY PROPOSALS. MIGHT ACTUALLY BE WHAT SOME STATES HAVE TRIED TO DO WHERE'S THE AMBIGUITY REGULATION OF STOP LOSS INSURANCE CALIFORNIA HAS DOUBLED IN THIS IS OF SAID NEW YORK WISCONSIN RECENTLY. INDEPENDENT EXTERNAL REVIEW OF APPEALS PROGRAMS AMBIGUOUS WHERE THE LINE IS. EMPLOYER PAIR PLAY HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS UP REGULATION OF THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATORS THAT ADMINISTER SELF INSURED PLANS REMEMBER I SAID ONE AETNA IN ITS GUYS OF NOT BEING IMMATURE BUT JUST BEING AN ADMINISTRATOR. RUNS A PLANNING GIVES AT MY CARDS CAN WE REGULATE THEM AS A PROVIDER OF WHAT WE GONNA CALL THAT ADMINISTRATION. SERVICES RIGHT THAT'S TRICKY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ASSURE MEMBER ASSEMBLY EMPLOYER CARRIES THE REST THURMOND MINISTRY. THERE HEALTH MINISTER THEY'VE PUSH PAPER OR VIRTUAL FORMS ARE ALRIGHT AND SO YOU CAN SEE WHERE WHERE THE FIGHT GOES FROM THERE. ALRIGHT SO WHAT ABOUT STATE SPECIFIC HEALTH CARE REFORM RIGHT ARM RESTORE MAY. PROHIBIT AN EMPLOYER MANDATE BECAUSE IT RELATES TO EMPLOYER SPONSORED PLANS RECESS LANGUAGE SAYS ANYTHING THAT RELATES TO. OR IS IN RELATION TO EMPLOYER SPONSORED PLANS IT WOULD ALL DEPEND ON ITS CHARACTERISTICS ON HOW FAR YOU COULD PUSH IT TO ONE SIDE OF THE LINE OF THE OTHER. AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE MEANING PUTTING IT ON WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL INSURED IS MOST LIKELY TO AVOID CHALLENGE THIS IS MY OPINION IF IT MAKES NO REFERENCE TO EMPLOYER SPONSORED HEALTH. RIGHT STAYING FAR AWAY FROM RIGHT THINK OF RESOURCES THE THIRD RAIL IN. DON'T WANT TO TOUCH THE ELECTRIC FENCE OKAY I JUST WELL IF I WANT TO CREATE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE AYE I WANT TO STAY AWAY. FROM TALKING ABOUT NUCLEAR SPONSORED HEALTH PLANS IN PARTICULAR IS MY FOCUS. EVEN TAXES YOU SHOULD KNOW BECAUSE PEOPLE OFTEN THINK OF TAXES IS BEING RELATIVELY WHAT LAWS OF GENERAL APPLICATION. RIGHT IT'S OF WHAT AND THEN THERE IS A RULE THAT SAYS A LOT GENERAL OBLIGATION INCIDENTALLY AFFECTS ON RISA PLAN. SURELY CAN'T BE SEEN AS ATTEMPTING TO REGULATE IN A RESERVE PLAN IN THERE FOR YOU KNOW GETTING ELECTROCUTED BUT EVENTAXES CAN REYES SARISSA PRETENSION. IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES DEPENDING ON HOW THE ORGANIZED. STATE LAW CONDITIONS TAX ADVANTAGES OR DISADVANTAGES ON PLAN DESIGN FEATURES AND THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW. WHAT'S SOMETIMES CALLED THE WALMART CASE REALLY THE REAL PATROL CASE OF THE STATE OF MARYLAND A SPIEGLER. OKAY WHERE THE MARYLAND LEGISLATURE. THEY DIDN'T HESITATE TO HAPPEN ELABORATE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY WHERE THEY ESSENTIALLY SAID I HATE WALMART. ON AND WRITTEN REPLETE THROUGHOUT THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY PASSED A LAW THAT SAID THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A CERTAIN KIND OF PAPER PLATES TAX OPTION. THE BITE WOULD ONLY BE ON EMPLOYERS ABOVE A CERTAIN SIZE SURPRISE THE ONLY EMPLOYER ABOVE A CERTAIN SIZE IN THE STATE OF MARYLAND WHAT THERE WAS JOHNS HOPKINS BUT THERE WAS A JOHNS HOPKINS EXCEPTION. OTHER THAN THAT WAS WALMART. OKAY A MOMENT WAS LIKE EXCUSE ME YOU KNOW ALL THE SIX LITTLE LIKE THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE ATTORNEYS A BILL OF ATTAINDER. YOU KNOW YOU'VE PASSED THE LAW TO TARGET ONE CORPORATION AND IT COMES FROM AN ANTI WALMART ANIMUS. THIS SURELY CANNOT BE YOU KNOW THE STATE REGULATION RIGHT SO AND OF COURSE OF THAT STATUTE WAS BROUGHT DEBT WAS STRUCK DOWN THE LIGHT THEIR LOT TO TAKE WAYS ONE MIGHT BE. A. PROBABLY BEST NOT TO FILL YOUR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY WITH. PROTESTATIONS OF HATRED. OKAY OF A PARTICULAR CORPORATE CITIZEN JUST. JUST GUESSING BUT BECAUSE THE COURT WAS THE JUDGE WAS QUITE STRUCK BY THAT AS ANYONE WOULD BE GREAT BUT ANOTHER MIGHT BE THAT HOME SO YOU CAN'T JUST SORT OF KIND OF MONKEY WITH IT TO KINDA. YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT TRYING TO KILL SMALL ENTREPRENEURIAL BUSINESSES WERE TRYING TO YOU KNOW TARGET WHAT WE SEE IS THE BIGGEST OFFENDERS ARE THINGS LIKE THIS. SO EVEN THEN THAT WAS REALLY A TAX BUT ATTACKS FOUND NOT TO BE NEUTRAL RIGHT. SO ONCE I GOT A COUPLE OF OTHER CASES BEYOND FIEDLER IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THEM THE GOLDEN GATE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION LOTS OF PEOPLE ASK ME SOON. WILL OR HOW DID THAT WORK. WITH THE REST ANOTHER AND I YOU KNOW IN A LITTLE UP ENOUGH TO BE DANGEROUS HOW DID THAT WORK RIGHT WITH A HEALTHY CALIFORNIA. AND YOU SHOULD KNOW LITERACY ISSUES WERE RAISED VERY EARLY. AS CHALLENGES TO HELP THE CALABASAS AND FRANCISCO EVEN THE WAY IT WAS DESIGNED A FEW RUPAUL. AN EXTRAORDINARY FACT SITUATION WHERE THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO ESSENTIALLY CREATES AN INSURANCE COMPANY. I DON'T THINK IT'S EVERY MUNICIPALITY IN THE UNITED STATES OR EVEN IN CALIFORNIA THAT WOULD SAY. I'VE GOT IT I'VE GOT A WAY AROUND IT IS A LET'S CREATE AN INSURANCE COMPANY ESSENTIALLY DOUBLE DELIVERS NEVER MIND JUST FINANCES BECAUSE RIGHT IT'S VISIBLE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY. BUT THAT IS ACTUALLY THE SERVE DOUBLE DIMENSION TO THAT IS ACTUALLY WHAT SAVED IT. FORMER US AT THE NINTH CIRCUIT. OKAY WITH THE NINTH CIRCUIT SAID LISTEN THEY GAVE EMPLOYERS IN CALIFORNIA A CHOICE AND ONE OF THEM WAS NOT TRAINED MONKEY WITH YOUR WRISTS A PLAN YOU COULD JUST GO AHEAD AND BE AND. HEALTHY SAN FRANCISCO ORAL TO COULD PAY YOU KNOW SOME AMOUNT BUT WE WEREN'T TRYING OF IT IS THE IDEA THAT IT WASN'T AN ALL OR NOTHING SEEMED PRETTY POWERFUL AND THAT IT WASN'T ALL TRYING TO REACH YOUR HANDS IN UNTIL PEOPLE. ALL TELL YOU HOW TO ORGANIZE YOUR PLAN. NOW JUST IF IT'S HELPFUL TO PEOPLE REMEMBER WHERE WE WERE SO THIS CASE WHICH BEHIND CIRCUIT OPINION CAME DOWN IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IF IT'S USEFUL FOR PEOPLE TO REMEMBER. BUT THEN IT WAS A PETITION FOR REHEARING ON FONG. SPUR ABOUT THAT. WHICH WAS DENIED SO IT TOOK AWHILE BUT EVENTUALLY A PETITION FOR CERT AT THE SUPREME COURT WAS FILED AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND NINE. THOSE OF YOU KNOW WHO FOLLOW THE SUPREME COURT NO THAT THEY WOULDN'T CONSIDER TAKING THAT UP UNTIL THE FALL OF TWO THOUSAND TEN AND THEN THEY WOULDN'T ACTUALLY HEAR IT UNTIL THE SPRING. BREAK AND GUESS WHAT. BEFORE KERRICK PATH. SO IT UNFIT IN ESSENCE BECAME. MOOD NOW THE SUPREME COURT DOESN'T SAY THAT THAT DOESN'T SAY HOW WE WOULD RULED THIS WAY THEY JUST CLIMB. OKAY SO YOU CANNOT READ A GREAT DEAL INTO A BOOK BUT WE DO KNOW IS THAT SO IT NEVER WENT BEYOND THE NINTH CIRCUIT. OKAY THIS IS A THEORY FROM THE NINTH CIRCUIT RIGHT THAT THIS MIGHT BE PERMISSIBLE THAT IT'S SOMEWHERE I'VE PUT. WELL THIS MIGHT BE WHERE THE STORY CONTINUES. RIGHT THIS IS A QUESTION WORTH ASKING. AND WORTH HAVING ANSWERED. BUT I DO THINK IT WOULD TAKE A TRIP TO THE SUPREME COURT. A ROUNDTRIP TICKET IS OFTEN DESCRIBED TO MY STUDENTS. WHICH MEANS IT UP TO GO UP THERE AND ASK FOR CERTIORARI IT'S DISCRETIONARY JURISDICTION AND THEN YOU'D HAVE TO GET THERE ON THE MERITS. OKAY. AND I'M NOT AN INEXPENSIVE TICKET. ARE INTELLECTUALLY FASCINATING STROKING BUT MY HUSBAND'S MONEY. I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT THIS ISSUE. IT NEEDS TO BE ANSWERED. MY FATHER WANTED TO SAY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT GO BABY OF LIBERTY MUTUAL ANOTHER COUPLE CASES ARE EXTREMELY RECENT OF THE SUPREME COURT WHAT THE CONTROLS ABOUT A RECESSION GO BAY I HAD SOME QUESTIONS. FROM PEOPLE. ASKING ME WHAT COULD WE DO SOMETHING ELSE COULD WE DO IT ALL PAYERS CLAIMS DATABASE KIND OF ATTEMPT AT REFORM COOLEY MAKE A MOVE TOWARDS TRANSPARENCY. AND SO THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW THIS CASE NO THE VERMONT STATUTE FOR ALL PAYERS CLAIMS DATABASE. STRUCK DOWN ON THE GROUNDS OF A RECIPIENT XIN. SIGNIFICANTLY ON JUSTICE KENNEDY WHO WROTE THE OPINION WAS NOT CONCERNED THAT THIS WAS THE STATE OF VERMONT TRYING TO DO SOMETHING IT WASN'T DUPLICATION. DIDN'T REQUIRE DUPLICATION. ALRIGHT ANY ALSO WASN'T CONCERNED THAT THE STATE OF VERMONT WAS TRYING TO DO SOMETHING THAT SEVENTEEN OTHER STATES WE TRY TO DO A DIFFERENT WAY SO. IT WASN'T. BECAUSE THAT WASN'T TRUE SO WASN'T ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN. IT WAS JUST. THE DEPARTMENT LABOR COULD DO THIS IF THEY WANTED TO. SO YOU SEE HOW STRONG THE PREEMPTION IS. EVEN JUST THE OPTION OF DOING IT SUCKED THE AIR OUT OF THE ROOM FOR VERMONT TO BE ABLE TO DO IT NOW I THINK SEVENTEEN STATES HAVE PASSED. IN ONE FORM ANOTHER A KIND OF AU PAIRS CLAIM DATABASE OF PHARMACEUTICALS DIFFERENT THINGS. ALRIGHT AND THEY'RE ALL STRUGGLING. OKAY ON ON THIS SAME GROUNDS ONES TO SAY JUST BOUGHT A COUPLE WORDS OF HAVING COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED ABOUT TWO VERY RECENT CASES AT THE SUPREME COURT NO WE WON'T OF TO THE SEVEN ON THE FIRST AMENDMENT BUT I WANT TO KNOW THE TO RISA. HAS BEEN AT THIS REAP BRING CORD AGAIN VERY RECENTLY. OKAY IN CASES INVOLVING RELIGIOUSLY SPONSORED HEALTH PLANS FLICK WIFE SHE TELLING ME THIS WELL YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT RELIGIOUS BY RELIGIOUS ORDERS HEALTH PLAN SPONSORED BY RELIGIOUS ORDERS THINK A CATHOLIC ORDER. THAT SPONSORS A PLAN YOU KNOW FOR TO PUT DATA AT A PARTICULAR FACILITY OKAY ARE EXEMPT FROM ARREST. NO IN THE COURSE OF OF MEN ARE TWO CASES. THE PREMISE AND THEY HAVE NOT BEEN DOING FOR ARGUMENT TWO SEPARATE CASES WHY DOES THIS MATTER. OUR SUPREME COURT WILL HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH HOW STRONG THE RECIPIENT XIN IS IN THOSE CASES YOU DO UNDERSTAND THAT RELIGIOUS ORDERS. OR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE RELIGIOUSLY AFFILIATED ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PREEMPTION ARGUMENT THEY ARE ARGUING NO NO IT'S GOT TO BE WEAKER WE CAN'T BE FORCED. VIRUSES TO DO THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME I THINK WE HAVE QUITE POSSIBLY FOR THE CURRENT COURT EXTREMELY SYMPATHETIC PLAINTIFFS. FOR FIRST AMENDMENT REASONS. AND THEY WILL BE RELUCTANT TO TAKE THE SLEDGEHAMMER OVER SUPREME XIN I BELIEVE IN GOAL. OKAY SO I ACTUALLY THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE YOUR SUPREME XIN. PERHAPS. LUCENT. SO OFTEN. NOW YOU I SAID. WELL THAT'S INTERESTING WILL WOULD BE LOOSING A SOFTENING OF RECIPIENTS AND I MIGHT ACTUALLY CREATE THE SPACE. RIGHT FOR IDEAS ABOUT STATE SPECIFIC HEALTH REFORM HEALTHCARE REFORM SOCIAL YOU ULTIMATELY THAT I'M A PRAGMATIST I PRACTICED LAW FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS BEFORE I BECAME A LAW PROFESSOR I'LL TELL YOU. THAT IN MASSACHUSETTS THEY SIMPLY NEGOTIATED THIS PROBLEM AWAY. OKAY YOU DO REMEMBER MASSACHUSETTS MADE OF ON THE STATE'S PACIFIC HEALTH CARE REFORM AT SIX YEARS BEFORE THE PORTAL CARE ACT WHICH COURSES FROM THE CARE BUT ON STEROIDS. RIGHT WOULD THAT THEY NEGOTIATED WITH. RIGHT SO THAT'S ONE OPTION. OKAY NO ONE EVERYONE BUT WAS ON THEN GOES WHAT WAS ON THE BARGAINING TABLE YOU WILL NOT REYES NERISSA. ATTACK. AND THEN EVERYONE SAID WHAT IT WOULD TAKE. TO GET THEM TO BUY INTO THE PROPOSITION. OKAY ALTERNATELY YOU COULD LITIGATED WHICH APPEARS TO BE WHERE SORT OF LAW HEALTHY SAN FRANCISCO WAS GOING RIGHT. YOU COULD TRY LEGISLATIVE YOU COULD TRY AND SEE IF YOU COULD GET A RESEARCH AMENDED IT WAS HAS BEEN AMENDED MANY TIMES YOU COULD TRY TO GET AN EXEMPTION. AS YOU MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW HAWAII HAS HAD AN EXEMPTION SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR. FOR ITS OWN STATE SPECIFIC HEALTH CARE REFORM YOU COULD BE LIKE. HAWAII TO. OKAY WE WANNA. WANNA BE LIKE THAT. OKAY WE JUST WANNA BE SPECIFICALLY ALLOWED TO GO OFTEN BY ME. AND ALLOWED TO DO OUR OWN THING. OKAY WIDE IF WAY BROKER THIS WAY HAD ITS OWN STATE SPECIFIC HEALTH CARE REFORM IN THE WORKS BEFORE A MISSILE WAS PASSED. AND SO THE PROBABLY HAD THE STRONGEST ARGUMENT AND THE QUICKEST MOBILIZATION AROUND HIM WOMEN WOMEN IN. WE GOOD DOING THIS LONG BEFORE YOU ARRANGE THE TEXTURES WERE NOT. YOU KNOW. THAT WE WE DON'T WANT TO ABANDON THIS OKAY WE ACTUALLY WANT TO DEVELOP THIS. AND SO AND SO THAT'S HOW IT WORKED. I'M I COULD BILLS AT LEAST I'M SURE YOU CAN THINK OF MANY MORE. ALRIGHT I'M GONNA STOP THERE. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME COME A TEST. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'D LIKE TO ASK IF THERE ARE ANY MEMBERS THAT DIES HAVE QUESTIONS. SURE I'M GETTING A STAB AT THIS. AND I SHOULD PROBABLY START BY SAYING I'M NOT A LAWYER. PRACTICE THE OTHER SIDE I'M AS A DOCTOR I. AM COMING TO GRIPS WITH THIS BUT MY PROFESSION TAUGHT ME TO BE A PROBLEM SOLVER SO I'M REALLY LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS FORWARD. AND WAS HOPING YOU COULD TALK ABOUT THE ROLE THAT A PAYROLL TAX MAY PLAY. IN HELPING US TO FINANCE UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE. AND IF NOTHING PREVENTED EMPLOYERS FROM MAINTAINING MULTISTATE ERISA PLANS AMMAN. WITH THAT TAX. IF THEY WANTED TO DO SO WOULD A STATE IMPOSED PAYROLL TAX PASSED THE WRITTEN MOSTLY. WELL AS I'VE SAID TAX HASN'T BEEN A MIXED BAG RIGHT IF THE TAX LOOKS LIKE. APPEAR PLAY OPTION IN THE GUISE OF ATTACKS. RIGHT MEMBER IN THE MARYLAND CASE. HE YOU JUST GOTTA PAY A HIGHER PERCENTAGE BUT WAIT A MINUTE NEWLY ONE IS GONNA PUT IT CLINIC IN. RIGHT. THEN NO COULD YOU TRY AND ARGUE THAT THIS IS A LAW OF NEUTRAL GENERAL NEUTRAL APPLICATION INCIDENTLY AFFECTING. UNDER IS A FAMINE BUT PLAN BUT NOT IN ITS TARGET TO DO THAT WOULD BE THE ARGUMENT DO I THINK THIS WOULD HAVE TO BE LITIGATED IF THEY WERE NOT IN AGREEMENT NOT TO RAISE IT I THINK IT MIGHT WELL HAVE TO BE TEST. BUT I DO THINK THAT YES THERE'S AN ARGUMENT. THERE. OKAY THERE'S A CASE CALL TRAVELERS FROM NINETEEN NINETY FIVE WHICH MAKES IT CLEAR. THAT IF SOMETHING IS INCIDENTAL TO LOVE GENERAL APPLICATION. SO YOU TRYING GET INTO THE TRAVELERS CRAWL INSIDE OF IT. ANTS AND STAY IN THAT SPEAKS THE GREAT QUESTION. KIND OF ALONG THE LINES A LITTLE BIT. I WAS THERE BEEN MANY LEGAL TO. LIKELY BE THE MORE LEGAL. YOU KNOW WHAT IT WHAT WOULD YOU THINK. CHALLENGE MIGHT LOOK LIKE AND HOW LONG WOULD SOMETHING LIKE THAT PLAY OUT. WELL. IN SAN FRANCISCO THE GOLDEN GATE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION WHICH SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW WAS A VERY LARGE. VERY LONG AND WELL ESTABLISHED RIGHT RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION UMP. WELL FUNDED OF. TOOK UP IT SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE PRIVATE INDUSTRY COMING AND I THINK YOU MIGHT SEE EMPLOYERS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IF YOU TELL PEOPLE YOU'RE NO LONGER TO HAVE THAT RISA. SHIELD. RIGHT FROM STATE HEALTHCARE REGULATION OF HOPE RIGHT THAT'S MONEY. THAT'S SIGNIFICANT MONEY THE REGULATORY BURDEN TRANSLATES INTO THE SIGNIFICANT COST. RIGHT AND SO. SOMEONE WHO'S CONCERNED ENOUGH ABOUT THAT COST. I THINK. WAS LIKELY TO GATHER AROUND A GROUP OF OTHER CONCERNED IF THERE'S NO AGREEMENT AND AND I THINK YOU'RE LIKELY TO SEE THE CHALLENGE REGISTRY HOW LONG WILL IT DO THINK A CASE LIKE THIS WOULD LIKELY GO TO THE SUPREME COURT I DON'T WANNA. BEAT YOU KNOW DISHONEST HERE BECAUSE A BE A CASE OF FIRST IMPRESSION I TOLD YOU THIS WAS NOT DECIDED. RIGHT STUMBLED RIGHT UP TO IT STOPPED. UCAS STUMBLED AROUND A FEW TIMES. AND THAT CAN TAKE A FEW YEARS DEPENDING ON ALONG THE WAY TO THE GOLDEN GATE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A TIME OF ONE AGAINST THEM THE GOLDEN GATE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION WILL PETITION FOR REHEARING. DO UNDERSTAND PROLONGED EACH PHASE OF IT A LITTLE BIT MORE NANBAN PRE HEARING US DE YOU KNOW. THERE ARE MANY PROCEDURAL MOVES TO MADE ALONG THE WAY TO THE SUPREME COURTS UNNECESSARILY OR AKA. SO A LOT DEPENDS ON CONDUCT IT WOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT EARNERS STRATEGY THAT I WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT THOUGH. BUT YES IT'S NOT INSTANTANEOUS. THAT THEY CAN KIND OF FOCUS YOU YOU GOT MY INTEREST EARLY ON WE GOT THIS. FIRST OFF THANK YOU AT THIS POUNDS HOPING TO BE FASCINATING I'M GLAD I AM IF I COULD PICK UP ANOTHER RESEARCH JUNKIE OF BEEN AWARE THE DEATH. I'M NOT QUITE THERE YET BUT I'M CLOSER THAN I WAS EARLIER. WHY? FROM MY MOTHER'S WOMB SANTA OF A RISK. SO I'M AND DO A LITTLE MATH HERE AND I'M GOOD AT SMALL MATH SO. WE HAVE BASICALLY THREE MILLION UNINSURED. WE HAVE THIRTEEN MILLION PEOPLE TO MEDICAID OR MEDICARE OUT THERE EXPANSION. SO THAT LEAVES TWENTY TWO MILLION PEOPLE OUT THERE COVERED BY SOME SORT OF PLANS YOU SAID. FIFTY TO SIXTY PERCENT OF THOSE ARE POSSIBLY COVERED BY RISA PLANTS IS THAT. WELL COVERED BY EMPLOYER FUNDED OKAY A HEALTH INSURANCE NOW YOU CAN DISCERN THAN YOU BACK THE NUMBER OUT FROM THE FORM IRIS FORM FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED AND THE LAWYER HAS DONE SOME GOOD NUMBER CRUNCHING ON THIS BUT THAT NUMBER IT'S ALWAYS A LITTLE OLD. NUMBERS BEEN GOING UP SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT BECAUSE THE REGULATORY BURDEN HAS BEEN RAISED. RIGHT ELIZABETH REACHING DEEPER INTO THE EMPLOYER POPULATION SO USED TO BE YOU JUST WOULDN'T SEE THIS KIND OF THING UNLESS THEY HAD AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED NOW IT'S DIPPING LOWER. SO I'M GONNA ASSUME THAT THAT NUMBERS AT LEAST THAT'S WHY I'M HESITANT TO SAY I KNOW THE NUMBER WILL BE DON'T HAVE TO HIT A BUTTON. BUT SOME BE BACK SO THE DATA FROM AYE ARRESTS. FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED AND THEN I THE CONCERT EFFECTIVE PROJECT IS GOING UP I WOULD SAY. IT'S PROBABLY THE NEW NORMAL. IN CALIFORNIA WOULD SAY THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS I'M GONNA GUESS FOREIGN EMPLOYER SPONSORED HEALTH INSURANCE ARE IN. AN EMPLOYER SELF FUNDED PLAN WHICH MEANS IT'S EXEMPT FROM STATE REGULATION. UNDER RISA. ALREADY STATUS QUO ANTE AND YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT KNOW THAT CULTURE SHOCK THIS. WOULD BE. OKAY WE ALWAYS ASSUME ALL THAT IS HIGHLY REGULATED INDUSTRY HEALTH CARE YOU KNOW BUT ACTUALLY WE. THE ACA DID NOTHING TO THE STAR OF THIS SORTING. MECHANISM AND THIS TREATING TO DIFFERENT GROUPS VERY DIFFERENTLY ONE ESSENTIALLY IS PROTECTED FROM REGULATION. RIGHT. PROTECT ITS THERE'S A BARRIER. ILLEGAL THERE. SUPERBLY BY THOSE NUMBERS ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA. BIG SAID. AND I DON'T WANT TO PRETEND TO AND EXPERTISE ON THIS I MEAN I I READ TO LLOYDS REPORTS YOU KNOW I READ A CONSULTING FIRMS REPORTS ARE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE BUT YES. FOR A LONG TIME NOBODY KNEW WHAT THESE NUMBERS OR BECAUSE EVEN THE FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED AND THIS IS OUR HOPE THAT NOW WE HAVE THIS. AND AND SO WE CAN KIND OF BACK IT OUT CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE TOP SIX STATES IN THE COUNTRY COUNTRY FOR THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF. WHAT YOU BUT IT'S NOT EVEN WHAT YOU GONNA BE KNOCKING OF HIS RISE ON LIKE NEW YORK'S IN THERE AND VOTE I? BUT ACTUALLY EVEN LIKE I BELIEVE. INDIANA NEBRASKA IT ITS TENDS TO BE STATEMENT THINK OF MEAT PACKING MEAT PROCESSING POULTRY PROCESS SIT WITH REALLY LARGE EMPLOYERS AND THEN IT DRIBBLES. DOWN FROM IT WHY WOULD SMALLER EMPLOYERS BE WILLING TO TAKE THIS RISK BECAUSE THEY TRYING TO. AVOID THE REGULATORY BURDEN I AND THEY ALWAYS FEEL LIKE THEY CAN PROTECT THEMSELVES OF STOP LOSS INSURANCE WHICH IS WHY I THINK THE LEGISLATURE GOT INTERESTED AND STOP LOSS INSURANCE BECAUSE OF CHANGE THE RULES ON. HOW SMALL YOU CAN BE A HOW EARLY YOU CAN ATTACH STOP LOSS INSURANCE TO PROTECT YOU FROM HAVING? THE ACTUAL SKULL FAMILY THEN WE IN SOME WAYS TO CREATE INCENTIVES AND DISINCENTIVES FOR SELF INSURING. RIGHT AND I THINK I DON'T WAS ANYBODY'S MOUTH I SUSPECT THAT THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE WE SECOND SAY IN NEW YORK AND WISCONSIN THERE ON THE RECORD THEY WERE CONCERNED SMALLER AND SMALLER EMPLOYERS. WERE SELF INSURING TAKING THEMSELVES OUT OF THE STATE REGULATORY INFRASTRUCTURE. UNBEKNOWNST TO THEIR EMPLOYEES. AND AND YOU KNOW THAT. CREATING ESSENTIALLY HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS THAT WERE NOT. MINIMUM ESSENTIAL COVERAGE. IS IT IS A SOBERING. PROFILE. THANK THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH. ANYONE ELSE AT THE. KNOWING THAT YOU GET YOUR WORKING STAYS ON JEWISH BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU NEED TO THINK CLASS WENT TO THE PENTAGON. THANK YOU SOME CAPTION IT COULD I ASK SORRY MY APOLOGIES I I CAME LATE BUT I. BUT YEARS AGO ACTUALLY READ OF MANY OF THE ARRESTS OF CASES I AM A LAWYER AND A LITTLE BIT OF INTEREST A GEEK. AND. AND I HAVE LIKE MANY OF US VIEW THIS AS A A REAL BARRIER TO US TRYING TO DO IMPORTANT THINGS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. OF AND I APOLOGIZE I WAS OUT OF THE ROOM WHEN YOU WENT THROUGH YOUR PRESENTATION BUT. I AM THERE WAS NO RISK CHALLENGE OF THE ACA RIGHT. NO BECAUSE ACTUALLY THE ACA AMENDED SARISSA WHO IN SOME SIGNIFICANT WAYS THAT IT NEEDS TO IN ORDER TO PERFORM SOME OF ITS FUNCTIONS ABOUT IT IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE ACA FROM TEMPLES ME UP. IT ALSO TRYING TO STANDARDIZE HEALTH INSURANCE ONLY COMING FROM THE GOVERNMENT I OFTEN PUT IT THIS WAY. IN UNDER RISA THE IMPULSE WAS TO LET THE EMPLOYER STANDARDIZE IT YOU KNOW THE MULTI STATE EMPLOYERS SO THEY COULD HAVE CONSISTENCY ACROSS STATES. AND UNDER THE ACA TO STANDARDIZE BUT WITH THE GOVERNMENT ALL DEPENDS ON WHO YOU WANT TO HAVE DO THE STANDARDIZING BEFORE COME FROM A HEALTH CARE FEDERALISM OF THE NEED FOR BETTER STANDARDIZATION. SO HAS SOME EXEMPTIONS THAT HAS SOME ALTERATIONS BECAUSE THAT'S FEDERAL LAW SO YOU CAN DO THAT STATE LAW CANNOT AMEND A RESERVE RIGHT THAT'S. BECAUSE OF. YOU KNOW. IT SUPERIORITY FEDERAL STATUTE. PUMP IT AND I THE THE BALL POINT A RELIGION TO ME IS THAT YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT ACCOUNT FOR AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WOULD AVOID INTEREST CHARGE AGAIN AS LONG AS WE DON'T. REFERENCE EMPLOYER SPONSORED OIL WOULDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE ABOUT ANYTHING WITH. ERISA IT GOES TO THE SUIT WELL FOR SO MANY GHOST A FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT TODAY TELL YOU THIS SOMETIMES FILL DISK RECORD JUDGES DECIDE THE CASES DIFFERENTLY ON THE SAME FACTS. PART THE REASON THIS IS SUCH A GNARLY AREA OF LAW IS THAT WE DON'T NECESSARILY EVEN HAVE CONSENSUS ON HOW TO INTERPRET AND APPLY IT. AND IT GOES TO THE SUPREME COURT SO FREQUENTLY. BECAUSE IT IS SO GNARLY THAT WE OFTEN END UP WITH CONFLICTS ON THE CIRCUIT LEVEL SO I HAVE NO. CONFIDENCE I'M SORRY I HOPE I DIDN'T PROTRUDE I CITY OF COMPANIES YOU COULD MAKE SUCH AN ARGUMENT BUT IF I JUST SHOW YOU IT UP KIND OF HOLLOW OPEN CRAWLING TO TO MAKE THAT ARGUMENT AND JUST REASONABLE AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IS MOST LIKELY TO AVOID CHALLENGE. IF IT MAKES NO REFERENCE TO EMPLOYER SPONSORED HEALTH PLANS ARE SAYING THAT'S HOW YOU AVOID IT DOES MEAN THAT WILL BE CHALLENGED EXACTLY GO TO SHOW. THERE ARE WAYS TO DO THINGS I THINK MAKE YOU LESS AND MORE VULNERABLE. SAWS AND SOME PRACTICAL ON THINKING THAT WAY RIGHT. THEN THEN. AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF SAN FRANCISCO IS VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE LAWSUIT BROUGHT BY THE GOING GET RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION I HAVEN'T SEEN A LEGAL MOUSE. HOW MUCH ROOM WITH THEIR BE? A AROUND WHAT SAN FRANCISCO DID ANOTHER WORDS I'M FAMILIAR WITH WHAT SAN FRANCISCO DID WITH THAT PETER PLAY ORDINANCE. BUT HAVE THERE BEEN. LAW REVIEW ARTICLES ARE OTHERS TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH ROOM IS THERE BEYOND WHAT SAN FRANCISCO DID THAT WOULD AVOID THE PIN NUMBER. I THINK EVERYONE AGREES THAT IF YOU THE COURAGE AND THE FORTITUDE IN THE FINANCING TO SET UP YOUR OWN HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY COULD PROBABLY IT DIDN'T MAKE AS MUCH OR A RUN THAT AT THIS GOAL AS THE GOLDEN GATE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION IS. HELP THE SAN FRANCISCO DID MEMBER THAT DID NOT GO TO THE SUPREME COURT BUT THAT MIGHT BE YOUR STRONGEST I GIVE YOU THE OTHER POINT OF LIGHT AT THE OTHER END OF THE FIEDLER CASE AMERICA ON THE WALMART CASE. SOMEWHERE BETWEEN WOULD BE THE TRAVELER CASE FROM NINETEEN NINETY FIVE OR CIVIL YOU MIGHT HAVE A STATUTE. THAT WAS WHAT OF GENERAL APPLICATION THAT ONLY INCIDENTALLY BURDEN GENEROUS SUPPLANTING OR YOUR SO NO I KNOW OF NO LAW REVIEW ARTICLE THAT SORT OF. MEDICINE THAT THERE ARE A COUPLE OF PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY WHO RIGHT ON THIS. IS PETER JACOBSEN. ATTIC LUCK. IF YOU WANT BUT I DON'T HIDE IT PUT MY EMAIL ON THAT FIRST THE VERY FIRST SLIDE AS A BE HAPPY TO SEND YOU LIKE. LINKS TO THAT WHAT THEY WRITE ABOUT YOU GUYS THEIR PEOPLE ALWAYS LIKE ME TRYING TO PUT THESE PIECES TOGETHER LIKE. LIKE A MOSAIC. YOU KNOW BECAUSE THIS HAS NOT BEEN RULED ON. LIVES ALL AGREE OKAY THIS WOULD BE A CASE OF FIRST IMPRESSION. AND IN A SENSE WITH THE GORSUCH WELL THEN THE THE NEWLY CONSTITUTED COURT WHETHER THEY BE MORE OR LESS LIKELY. YOUR WAS LOOKING FOR WHO. UP IN A COURT WHOEVER HAS A BACK ON AND HIGHLY TECHNICAL EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND COMPLICATED AREA LIKE A RESERVE THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENCE IF ANYBODY HAS IN A RESERVE BACKGROUND. NOT GONNA BE SUPPRESSED KNOW THAT RIGHT I ALSO PRACTICE IN ANY TRUST. I CAN TELL YOU ON THE SUPREME COURT HAS A BACKGROUND IN ANY TOUGHEST AND PEOPLE TEND TO FOR. OKAY EVEN SOMETIMES ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM BECAUSE IT'S JUST SO COMPLICATED. SO I'D LIKE REALLY CAN'T SAY WE HAVE A COUPLE OF BUSINESS LITIGATORS. ON THERE AND SO YES I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. THAT I CAN'T SAY MORE THAN THAT IT'S NOT WE'RE GONNA KNOW WHO CARES THE MOST ABOUT RISK BY WHO GETS TO WRITE THE OPINIONS IN THE TWO CASES INVOLVING. RELIGIOUS PLANTS. RIGHT THAT I TALKED ABOUT BECAUSE THEY WERE GONNA WHO STEPS FORWARD TO SAY I WANNA WRITE A GNARLY A RECIPIENT. IT IMPLICATES THE FIRST SUMMIT WE'RE GOING TO FIGURE OUT WHO. SO JUSTICE KENNEDY WROTE THE OPINION RIGHT AND SO BAKER. THAT TELLS US SOMETHING ARGUES INTERESTED IN HE WAS A BUSINESS LITIGATOR RIGHT IN SACRAMENTO. M.. BUT THIS IS VERY MUCH YOU KNOW KILLING IT TO CAN IN MEANING THE ENTRANCES SO I I DON'T WANT TO PRETEND YOU DON'T KNOW WHO WOULD BE IF THIS ONE TO THE RECORD WHO WOULD STEP FORWARD TO WRITE YOU DO KNOW THAT THE. CHIEF JUSTICE ASSIGNS THE WRITING. SO AND IF HE IF HE IN THIS CASE IS IN THE MAJORITY HIS IT CAN'T EVEN ASSIGN IT TO HIMSELF. SO IT'S POSSIBLE. YOU KNOW ANYTHING FROM CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS TO. THANK YOU. FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH THE DISSENT IN THE US SO TAKE CASE WAS. KAGAN. AND GINSBURG. KENNEDY AND BRIAR WORLD OPPOSITION AND THEN. IF YOU CARE ABOUT THESE KIND COUNTING NOSES. THANK YOU. THANK. NEXT WE HAVE DOCTOR Q. PENSKE WHO IS AN ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF THE PROGRAM ON MEDICARE POLICY AT THE. KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION. AS AN EXPERT ON MEDICARE POLICY DOCTOR COULD DANCE HE FOCUSES ON PRODUCING TIMELY AND AUTHORITATIVE ANALYSIS. I'M WAITING MEDICARE REFORM PROPOSALS AND ON INFORMING THE DEBATE ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. THANK YOU FOR COMING. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE WITH YOU. AT TODAY'S COMMITTEE HEARING ON IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS FOR UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. MY NAME IS JULIA QB ON SKI AND I ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF THE PROGRAM ON MEDICARE POLICY AT THE KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION. KAISER IS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION FOCUSING ON NATIONAL HEALTH ISSUES AND WE SERVICE THE NONPARTISAN SOURCE OF FACTS ANALYSIS AND JOURNALISM. FOR POLICY MAKERS THE MEDIA THE HEALTH POLICY COMMUNITY AND THE PUBLIC. AND FOR THE RECORD WE ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH KAISER PERMANENTE A. MY ROLE TODAY IS TO PROVIDE YOU WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE FEDERAL LAW CONSIDERATIONS RELATED TO MEDICARE. THAT ARE RELEVANT TO THE STATE'S DISCUSSION ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION OF A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM. LET ME BEGIN BY PROVIDING YOU WITH A QUICK OVERVIEW OF MEDICARE TO SET SOME CONTEXT. MEDICARE COVER SIXTY MILLION PEOPLE IN THE U. S. AND SIX MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA OR ONE IN SIX STATE RESIDENTS. MOST PEOPLE WITH MEDICARE ARE AGES SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER BUT A SMALL SHARE QUALIFY BECAUSE THEY'RE UNDER AGE SIXTY FIVE AND HAVE A PERMANENT DISABILITY. AND WHILE MOST PEOPLE WITH MEDICARE ARE IN TRADITIONAL MEDICARE ALSO KNOWN AS FEE FOR SERVICE MEDICARE. MORE THAN FOUR IN TEN BENEFICIARIES IN CALIFORNIA ARE ENROLLED IN MEDICARE ADVANTAGE. WHERE THERE MEDICARE COVERED BENEFITS ARE DELIVERED THROUGH PRIVATE PLANS LIKE HMOS AND PPO DOES THAT CONTRACT WITH MEDICARE? MEDICARE BENEFITS ARE DIVIDED UP INTO FOUR PARTS A. B. C. AND D.. GENERALLY SPEAKING A COVERS HOSPITAL SERVICES BE COVERS PHYSICIAN SERVICES D. COVERS PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND SEE REFERS TO MEDICARE ADVANTAGE. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SPENDING ON THESE BENEFITS WAS SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AND HERE AND FIGURE TO YOU CAN SEE HOW THE SPENDING WAS DISTRIBUTED. THIS TOTAL INCLUDES MEDICARE'S ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS BOTH THE COST TO THE GOVERNMENT TO OPERATE THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. AND THE COSTS TO PRIVATE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE AND PARTY PLANS. TOGETHER THESE ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE ABOUT SEVEN PERCENT OF TOTAL SPENDING IN TENTY SIXTEEN. FOR PEOPLE TURNING SIXTY FIVE IN ROLLING IN PART A AND B. IS AUTOMATIC IF THEY'RE ALREADY GETTING SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS AT THAT POINT. THOUGH TECHNICALLY PART BE IS VOLUNTARY BUT IF PEOPLE DON'T WANT PART BEEP BEEP PARTY COVERAGE THEY HAVE TO OPT OUT OF THE PARTY PROGRAM. IF PEOPLE WANT PART DEED DRUG COVERAGE THEY MUST SIGN UP FOR A PLAN THAT OFFERS THIS COVERAGE IS NOT AUTOMATIC LIKE A AND B. ENROLLMENT. THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF MEDICARE ARE FINANCED DIFFERENTLY. PART A LOT IS FUNDED MAINLY BY A TWO POINT NINE PERCENT PAYROLL TAX ON EARNINGS THAT. IS EQUALLY SPLIT BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES. AND THIS MONEY IS DEPOSITED INTO THE HOSPITAL INSURANCE TRUST FUND. HIGHER INCOME TAX PAYERS PAY AN ADDITIONAL ZERO POINT NINE PERCENT MAYOR MEDICARE PAYROLL TAX. PART B. IS FUNDED BY A GENERAL REVENUES FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH IS MOSTLY INCOME TAX. WHICH ARE SAID TO COVER SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF PROGRAM COSTS EACH YEAR. AND BENEFICIARIES ALSO PAY MONTHLY PREMIUMS WHICH COVER THE OTHER TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. HIGHER INCOME BENEFICIARIES PAY A HIGHER SHARE OF PROGRAM COSTING RECEIVE A LOWER FEDERAL SUBSIDY. PARTY IS FUNDED SIMILAR LEAD TO PART BE WITH GENERAL REVENUES COVERING ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF PROGRAM COSTS EACH YEAR AND BENEFICIARY PREMIUMS AND STATE TRANSFERS COVERING THE REST. AND LIKE PART BE HIGHER INCOME BENEFICIARIES PAY A HIGHER SHARE OF PROGRAM COSTS FOR PART D. COVERAGE. SO LET ME TRANSLATE THESE DIFFERENT FUNDING STREAMS AND ACTUAL DOLLAR AMOUNTS. FOR TWENTY SIXTEEN FOR PARTS A BMD. PART SEE IS NOT SHOWN SEPARATELY HERE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ITS OWN FINANCING STREAM. SO TOTAL REVENUE TO MEDICARE AND TWENTY SIXTEEN WAS SEVEN HUNDRED AND TEN BILLION DOLLARS. PART A REVENUE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN TOTAL TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY ONE BILLION DOLLARS OF WHICH THE VAST MAJORITY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS WAS FOUND PAYROLL TAXES. PART BE REVENUE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WAS THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. OF WHICH THREE QUARTERS OR TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS WAS FROM GENERAL REVENUE. BENEFICIARIESPAID SEVENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN PART B. PREMIUMS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. PARDEE REVENUE WAS A HUNDRED AND SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN OF WHICH EIGHTY TWO BILLION WAS FROM GENERAL REVENUES AND BENEFICIARIES PAID FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN PARTY PREMIUMS. SO I KNOW I JUST MENTIONED A LOT OF NUMBERS AND YOU MAY REMEMBER NOT OF THEM BUT THE POINT I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE IS THAT. MEDICARE RECEIVES A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT OF FEDERAL DOLLARS FROM PAYROLL TAXES AND GENERAL REVENUES BUT ALSO A NOT INSIGNIFICANT PORTION OF FUNDING IS FROM BENEFICIARIES THEMSELVES. IN THE FORM OF MONTHLY PREMIUM PAYMENTS. SO NOW WE FOCUS IN ON THE SPECIFICS OF MEDICARE WAIVER AUTHORITY WHICH I KNOW YOU'RE VERY INTERESTED IN. SO TITLE EIGHTEEN OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT IS HEALTH INSURANCE FOR THE AGED AND DISABLED WHICH WE KNOW AS MEDICARE. WHO QUALIFIES FOR THE PROGRAM THAT BENEFITS TO WHICH THEY ARE ENTITLED THE MONTHLY PREMIUMS THAT PEOPLE PAY THE COST SHARING PAYMENTS THAT THEY PAY FOR SERVICES? HOW PROVIDERS ARE PAID AND HOW THE PROGRAM IS FINANCED ARE ALL GOVERNED BY STATUTE? BUT FEDERAL LAW ALSO PERMITS THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES OR HHS TO WAIVE CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF MEDICARE LAW IN ORDER TO CONDUCT DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS. AND TEST MODELS OF PAYMENT AND DELIVERY SYSTEM REFORMS RELATED TO MEDICARE. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TO SPECIFIC PROVISIONS THAT ALLOW FOR THIS TYPE OF WAIVER ACTIVITY. ONE IS SECTION FOUR OH TWO OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENTS OF NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN WHICH. AIMS TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY AND ECONOMY OF MEDICARE ALLOWING FOR EXPERIMENTS AND DEMONSTRATIONS TO TEST ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF PAYING FOR MEDICARE SERVICES. OR COVERING OTHER BENEFITS THAT ARE NOT ALREADY PAID FOR. BY MEDICARE. THE WAIVER AUTHORIZES THE SECRETARY TO WAIVE MEDICARE PAYMENTS. THAT ARE REQUIRED TO CARRY OUT THE DEMONSTRATION UNDER THE SECTION FOUR OH TO AUTHORITY. THAT. SECTION ELEVEN FIFTEEN A ESTABLISH A CENTER FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID INNOVATION THIS WAS AUTHORIZED OR CREATED BY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. DOES SENATOR MEDICARE AND MEDICARE AND MEDICAID INNOVATION ALSO KNOWN AS THE INNOVATION CENTER OR CMMI. HAS BROAD AUTHORITY TO TEST INNOVATIVE MODELS FOR SERVICE DELIVERY AND PAYMENT METHODS THAT DECREASE COSTS AND OR IMPROVE. OR MAINTAIN QUALITY IN MEDICARE MEDICAID AND CHIP. SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN THIS HAS BEEN THE PRIMARY VEHICLE FOR TESTING INNOVATIONS AND MEDICARE PAYMENT AND SERVICE DELIVERY. IN ADDITION CONGRESS CAN ALSO MANDATE. SPECIFIC MEDICARE DEMONSTRATIONS THROUGH LEGISLATION. I WANT NOTE THAT THESE MEDICARE WAIVERS AND DEMONSTRATIONS ARE DIFFERENT FROM MEDICAID AND ACA WAIVERS WHICH CHIQUITA WILL BE TELLING YOU MORE ABOUT SHORTLY. THOSE WAIVERS MAY BE MORE OF A VEHICLE FOR EXPANDING STATE'S DISCRETION OVER PROGRAM RULES GOVERNING ELIGIBILITY BENEFITS AT CETERA. BUT THIS IS GENERALLY NOT THE CASE FOR MEDICARE WAIVERS. AT UNLIKE MEDICAID AN ACA THERE IS REALLY LITTLE PRECEDENT FOR STATES TO SEEK BROAD WAIVERS OF FEDERAL LAW RELATED TO MEDICARE IN LARGE PART I THINK BECAUSE MEDICARE IS A NATIONAL PROGRAM. AND STATES ARE NOT REALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ADMINISTERING IT. SO AND BECAUSE THE SECTION FOR O. TO AUTHORITY HAS REALLY NOT BEEN USED IN THE CONTEXT OF A STATE BASED HEALTH CARE PROGRAM. AND THE SECRETARY WAIVER AUTHORITY UNDER SECTION ODE TO IS LIMITED TO MEDICARE'S PAYMENT RULES I WANT TO FOCUS MORE ON THE INNOVATION CENTER AND WHAT IT DOES. SO AS I SAID THE CENTER HAS BROAD AUTHORITY TO TEST AND DEVELOP NEW PAYMENT AND SERVICE DELIVERY MODELS AND MEDICARE AND THIS INCLUDES STATEWIDE INITIATIVES. THE INNOVATION CENTER PLAYS AN INTEGRAL ROLE IN THE PROCESS OF GOING FROM THE IDEA OF A MODEL TO ACTUALLY TESTING IT. THE GENERAL OUTLINE OF THIS PROCESS IS THAT THE INNOVATION CENTER SOLICITS IDEAS FOR NEW MODELS. IT REVIEWS SELECTS AND DEVELOPS THE MOST PROMISING MODELS. IT DETERMINES THE APPROPRIATE BENCHMARKS. TO MEASURE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE MODEL. AND SELECT PARTNERS TO TEST THE MODELS TYPICALLY THROUGH A COMPETITIVE PROCESS. THESE MODELS REQUIRE RIGOROUS MONITORING TESTING AND INDEPENDENT EVALUATIONS OF THEIR. PROGRESS. TYPICALLY THESE MODELS HAVE AN END DATE ALTHOUGH THE DURATION AND THE SCOPE OF THE MODELS CAN BE EXPANDED THROUGH A FORMAL RULE MAKING PROCESS. IF THE HHS SECRETARY DETERMINES THAT EXPANSION OF THE MODEL WILL REDUCE PROGRAM SPENDING AND BY THAT I MEAN MEDICARE PROGRAM SPENDING SPECIFICALLY. WITHOUT REDUCING QUALITY OR WILL IMPROVE QUALITY. INCREASING SPENDING. THESE MODELS ARE NOT INITIALLY REQUIRED TO BE BUDGET NEUTRAL. BUT THE MODELS CAN BE TERMINATED OR MODIFIED UNLESS THE HHS SECRETARY DETERMINES THAT A MODEL AS MODIFIED. IS EXPECTED TO IMPROVE QUALITY WITHOUT INCREASING SPENDING REDUCE SPENDING WITHOUT REDUCING QUALITY OR IMPROVE QUALITY AND REDUCE SPENDING. SO JUST TO BE CLEAR THE CORE PURPOSE OF THE INNOVATION CENTER IS TO TEST INNOVATIVE PAYMENT AND SERVICE DELIVERY MODELS TO REDUCE PROGRAM EXPENDITURES WHILE PRESERVING OR ENHANCING THE QUALITY OF CARE. THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF INNOVATION MODELS THAT THE CENTER CARRIES OUT AND I DON'T HAVE TIME TO FOCUS ON THE SPECIFICS OF EACH OF THESE CATEGORIES. BUT I DID WANT YOU TO SEE THE RANGE OF MODELS THAT THE INNOVATION CENTER HAS AUTHORITY TO TEST. AND CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY DOES HAVE INITIATIVES UNDERWAY IN SEVERAL OF THESE CATEGORIES. BUT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THIS LAST CATEGORY INNOVATION I IN INITIATIVES TO ACCELERATE. THE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF NEW PAYMENT AND SERVICE DELIVERY MODELS. THIS IS WHERE SEVERAL STATE BASED INITIATIVES. THAT INVOLVE MEDICARE PARTICIPATION ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED INCLUDING MARYLAND'S ALL PAYER MODEL I KNOW YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD. AT A PREVIOUS HEARING DETAILS ABOUT MARYLAND'S MODEL SO I WON'T GO INTO DETAIL ABOUT IT HERE. BUT ORIGINALLY OUT I WON AND I MENTION A COUPLE POINTS ABOUT IT MARYLAND'S MODEL ORIGINALLY TOOK THE FORM OF A WAIVER ESTABLISHED IN FEDERAL LAW. UNDER THE ORIGINAL WAIVER MEDICARE PAYS HOSPITAL RATES THAT MEDICARE'S BUT THAT MARILYN STATS NOT THE RATES THAT MEDICARE'S SETS. AND I ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT MARILYN'S WEAVER IS UNIQUE. AND SOMEWHAT LIMITED IN SCOPE AND THAT IT DOESN'T CHANGE MEDICARE BENEFITS OR ELIGIBILITY OR COST SHARING OR FINANCING OR THE FUNDING STREAMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICARE TRUST FUNDS. NOR THE UNDERLYING COVERAGE ARRANGEMENTS OF PEOPLE WITH WITH MEDICARE IN THE STATE OF MARYLAND. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT MARILYN'S ORIGINAL WAIVER IS SHIFTING AWAY FROM THE STATUTORY WAIVER THAT THE STATE RECEIVED. TO THIS NEW ALL PAYER MODEL WHICH WAS DEVELOPED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE INNOVATION CENTER. AND HAS VERY SPECIFIC MEDICARE SAVINGS TARGETS TO MEET. IN ORDER TO CONTINUE. I ALSO WANT TO CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THE STATE INNOVATION MODELS. WHICH FALLS WITHIN THIS CATEGORY WHICH IS WHERE STATES CAN DESIGN AND TEST NEW A MULTI PAYER. AT PAYMENT AND DELIVERY MODELS WHICH WITH POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE CARE AND LOWER COSTS NOT AND TO IMPROVE HEALTH SYSTEM PERFORMANCE. THIS MODEL HAS BEEN ROLLING OUT IN SEVERAL STAGES AND IN FACT CALIFORNIA DID RECEIVE TWO ROUNDS OF FUNDING IN THE DESIGN STAGES. OF THIS INITIATIVE. CURRENTLY THERE ARE ELEVEN STATES IN THE TESTING STAGE WITH THE WIDE RANGE OF PROPOSALS BEING TESTED AND THESE STATE INNOVATION MODELS ARE BURIED. AND ALSO AMBITIOUS. IT'S DIFFICULT TO SUMMARIZE THEM IN A SENTENCE OR TWO. BUT BUT I WOULD SAY IN GENERAL SEVERAL STATES HAVE BUILT THEIR PLANS AROUND PATIENT CENTERED MEDICAL HOMES. INTEGRATING PRIMARY CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE. EXPANDING HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EFFORTS LIKE TELEHEALTH. AND MOVING TO VALUE BASED PAYMENTS SHARED SAVINGS AND ACCOUNTABLE CARE PAYMENT MODELS. CMS HAS SOMEWHAT HOPEFULLY I THINK RELEASED GUIDANCE IN SUPPORT OF MEDICARE PARTICIPATION IN THESE MODELS THOUGH I'D ALSO NOTE THAT THE INTEGRATION OF MEDICARE IN STATE INNOVATION MODELS IS SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL SCRUTINY. BY CMS. FOR STATES THAT WANT TO INCORPORATE MEDICARE PARTICIPATION IN A STATE INNOVATION MODEL THE PLAN MUST ADHERE TO SEVERAL SPECIFIC PRINCIPLES AND IT MUST HAVE A CLEARLY DEFINED TARGET POPULATION EITHER. AFFECTED PATIENTS OR AFFECTED PROVIDERS OR BOTH. IT MUST HAVE A CLEAR POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE QUALITY AND REDUCE THE SPENDING FOR THE COVERED POPULATION. AND THE STATE MUST HAVE DEMONSTRATED PREPAREDNESS TO UNDERTAKE THE PROPOSAL. AND I WOULD SAY THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY THE DECISION RESTS WITH THE INNOVATION CENTER AND ITS FEDERAL PARTNERS. AS TO WHETHER TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE STATE'S PLAN UNDER THE STATE INNOVATIONS MODEL OR ANY OF THE OTHER MODELS. THAT THE INNOVATION CENTER HAS STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO PURSUE. SO OBVIOUSLY A KEY QUESTION IT. FOR CALIFORNIA IS WHETHER THE STATE CAN USE EXISTING CMMI AUTHORITY OR SECTION FOUR OH TO MEDICARE WAIVER AUTHORITY. IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM. I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES RECOGNIZE THAT STATES PLAY A KEY ROLE IN HEALTH CARE DELIVERY AND REFORM EFFORTS. AND HAS IN FACT OPENS THE DOOR TO STATE INITIATIVES THAT INCLUDE MEDICARE PARTICIPATION. EXISTING AUTHORITY DOES IN FACT ALLOW FOR MODELS TESTING CHANGES TO MEDICARE PAYMENT AND SERVICE DELIVERY TO IMPROVE QUALITY AND A CHIEF PROGRAM SAVINGS I'VE SAID THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AND THERE'S CLEARLY THE POTENTIAL TO TAKE STEPS TOWARD TRANSFORMATIVE SYSTEM CHANGE IN THE STATE INNOVATION MODELS UNDER THE INNOVATION CENTERS EXISTING AUTHORITY. BUT FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM THE STATE WOULD NEED MORE THAN JUST A WAIVER OF STATUTORY PROVISIONS RELATED TO MEDICARE PAYMENT AND SERVICE DELIVERY. AND WOULD NEED TO SEEK PERMISSION TO MAKE BROADER CHANGES WHICH MAY NOT BE ENVISIONED IN THEIR ENTIRETY IN THE CURRENT ROSTER OF INNOVATION CENTER ACTIVITIES. AND WHICH DO NOT SEEM TO FALL WITHIN THE SCOPE OF SECTION FOUR OH TO AUTHORITY. SEEKING PERMISSION FOR THE MEDICARE CHANGES THAT ARE LIKELY TO BE NEEDED FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF A STATE BASED SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM WOULD BE A A DEPARTURE FROM EXISTING APPLICATIONS OF THE DEMONSTRATION AND MODEL TESTING PROCESS. WHEREBY THE STATE WOULD BE SEEKING TO MAKE PERMANENT CHANGES TO THE STATE'S ENTIRE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR ALL OF THE STATE'S RESIDENTS. AND NOT JUST ON A TIME LIMITED BASIS. WITH THAT WITH THEM FOCUSED MUCH BROADER THAN JUST MEDICARE PAYMENT AND SERVICE DELIVERY. AND AS SUCH I THINK THERE IS A REALLY A GREAT DEAL OF UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHAT AT ADMINISTRATION AND PERHAPS ADMINISTRATION. WILL ENTERTAIN THROUGH WAIVERS OR INNOVATION CENTER MODELS. SO I WOULD CONCLUDE BY SAYING THAT I I THINK USING CMMI AUTHORITY OR OTHER MEDICARE WAIVER AUTHORITY. TO IMPLEMENT A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA WOULD BE NECESSARY. BUT IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE SUFFICIENT. BEYONCE SEEKING PERMISSION FROM HHS FOR CHANGES THAT CAN BE MADE UNDER EXISTING AUTHORITY FLEXIBLE AS IT MIGHT BE WITH REGARD TO STATE INNOVATIVE ACTIVITY. IT IS STILL THE CASE THAT FEDERAL STATUTORY CHANGES WOULD BE NEEDED MEANING CONGRESS WOULD NEED TO PASS AND THE PRESIDENT WOULD NEED TO SIGN LEGISLATION TO MAKE NUMEROUS CHANGES. I I THINK PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY THE EXISTING STATUTORY WAIVER PROCESS AND THE AUTHORITY GRANTED THE INNOVATION CENTER DO NOT APPEAR TO PERMIT THE HHS SECRETARY TO SIMPLY REDIRECTS. MEDICARE'S FUNDING STREAMS. INCLUDING THE PAYROLL TAXES THE GENERAL REVENUES AND BENEFICIARY PREMIUMS OR TRUST FUND DOLLARS TO STATES TO OVERSEE AND MANAGE THESE FUNDS IN THEIR ENTIRETY ON BEHALF OF THE STATE'S ENTIRE MEDICARE POPULATION THROUGH A STATE BASED HEALTH CARE PROGRAM. THE SECRETARY ALSO HAS NO AUTHORITY TO CHANGE MEDICARE ELIGIBILITY OR ENROLLMENT RULES. OR TO CHANGE THE RULES RELATED TO HOW MUCH BENEFICIARIES PAY IN PREMIUMS AND COST SHARING. THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WOULD NEED TO BE CHANGED THROUGH FEDERAL LEGISLATION TO FULLY INCORPORATE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES IN THE STATE SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM. AND BEYOND THE LEGISLATIVE CHANGES THAT WOULD BE NEEDED INCORPORATING MEDICARE IN A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM AT THE STATE LEVEL WOULD REQUIRE A HIGH DEGREE OF COLLABORATION. BETWEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE STATE TO MAKE IT WORK AND I THINK IT'S AN OPEN QUESTION AS TO THE WILLINGNESS OF THIS ADMINISTRATION TO COLLABORATE. ON CHANGES OF THIS MAGNITUDE AT THIS TIME. BUT EVEN THEN A CONDUCIVE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT WHERE THAT COLLABORATION EXISTED THE STATE WOULD REALLY NEED TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ADDRESS MANY STATUTORY. FIVE REGULATORY AND ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES RELATED TO INTEGRATING MEDICARE INTO THE STATE'S SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM. BUT I DON'T AND. CHIQUITA. SO OUR NEXT SPEAKER HANG ON SECOND. CHIQUITA BROOKS. WITH YOUR. OKAY ARE A GOOD THOUGHT. MANAGING DIRECTOR FROM AN THAT HELP. OF FORMER POLICY IF ISSUE PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN GUIDING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THROUGH PASSAGE AND IMPLEMENTATION. PLEASE CLICK THANK YOU IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE WITH YOU THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME. IT'S ALWAYS WONDERFUL TO TALK ABOUT COVERAGE AND SO I'M REALLY EXCITED TO BE HERE. I'M GONNA FOCUS NEXT ON MEDICAID AND MARKETPLACE WHICH I KNOW YOU'RE PRETTY FAMILIAR WITH GIVEN CALIFORNIA'S. VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN IMPLEMENTATION. OF BOTH OF THOSE PROGRAMS AS YOU KNOW. MEDICAID IS A JOINTLY FUNDED PROGRAM I'VE JOINTLY FEDERAL AND STATE PROGRAM AND THE MEDICAID STATUTE ESTABLISHES CERTAIN RULES. THAT STATES MUST ME AND IN ORDER TO RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDING. UNDER SECTION ELEVEN FIFTEEN OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES HAS BROAD BUT NOT UNLIMITED. AUTHORITY TO WAIVE CERTAIN FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. FOR THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. AND THE SLIDE YOU CAN SEE A COUPLE OF THE KEY PROVISIONS. THE FEDERAL. MEDICAID LAW REQUIRES THAT WEAVERS FURTHER THE OBJECTIVES OF THE PROGRAM SO I THE INTENT OF A DEMONSTRATION IS TO IN IN SOME WAY MOVE FORWARD WHAT THE MEDICAID PROGRAM I. WAS INTENDED TO DO. IT'S AUTHORIZED FOR DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES SUBJECT TO EVALUATION SIMILAR TO WHAT JULIET WAS SAYING ABOUT INNOVATION CENTER AUTHORITY. AND YOU KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WAIVERS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE TESTING SOMETHING SO THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE. DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES IN ORDER TO EVALUATE AND. I IT IS THOSE EFFORTS AND A WAIVER NEEDS TO AFFECT A SECTION OF THE MEDICAID LOT THAT IS SUBJECT TO WAVER AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT MORE DEATH. BY LONG STANDING OF PRACTICE WAIVERS MONTHS MUST BE BUDGET NEUTRAL TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT MEANS THAT OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD THE STATE'S DEMONSTRATION SHOULD NOT COST MORE. ADDED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON THE MEDICAID SIDE THEN IT WOULD IN ABSENCE OF THE WEAVER. THIS IS TYPICALLY EVALUATED ON A PER MEMBER PER MONTH BASIS BUDGET NEUTRALITY IS A BIG PART OF NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THE STATE'S. PUBLIC COMMENT PERIODS ARE ALSO REQUIRED BOTH AT THE STATE LEVEL. AND THE AND THE FEDERAL LEVEL GIVEN JUST THE IMPORTANCE OF AYE THE AUTHORITY OF THE ELEVEN FIFTEEN AND THE CHANGES THAT THAT CAN BE CONTEMPLATED. I THE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SLIDE SHE GIVES YOU A. BASICALLY AN OVERVIEW OF A LOT OF THE COMMON. WAIVERS THAT WE'VE SEEN ACROSS THE STATES. FOR ELEVEN FIFTEEN AUTHORITY IN FACT CALIFORNIA HAS SOME OF THESE WAIVERS ARE NO THEIR FAMILIAR TO YOU. I'VE MANAGED CARE MANY STATES IMPLEMENTED MANAGED CARE IN THEIR STATES THROUGH ELEVEN FIFTEEN AUTHORITY PARTICULARLY. IN THE EARLY YEARS BEFORE IT BECAME EASIER TO DO THAT. UNDER. UNDER REGULAR MEDICAID LAW. DELIVERY SYSTEM REFORM WAIVERS AYE UNCOMPENSATED CARE POOL SWEAR TYPICALLY HOSPITALS ARE GIVEN AT PAYMENTS FOR UNCOMPENSATED CARE. AND EXPANSION RELATED OF WAIVERS AGAIN A NUMBER OF STATES BEFORE THE ACA EXPANDED COVERAGE TO ADDITIONAL POPULATION. SOME AFTER BUT MADE SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO MEDICAID COVERAGE. SO THIS NEXT SLIDE REALLY OUTLINES WHAT ARE SOME OF THE IMPORTANT PROVISIONS THAT THE STATUTE MAKES CLEAR THAT ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER CAN. CAN CHANGE THE FIRST IS STATEWIDE MRS REQUIREMENT IN THE FEDERAL LAW THAT THE MEDICAID PROGRAM REALLY LOOK CONSISTENT ACROSS THE STATE. I IN TERMS OF. HOW IT OPERATES AND THAT'S ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT CAN BE WAIVED? THERE'S ALSO REQUIREMENT FOR SINGLE STATE AGENCY TO IMPLEMENT AND SET THE RULES ANOTHER PROVISION THAT CAN BE WAIVED IN MOST THESE KEY PROVISIONS ARE ACTUALLY IN. THE TEMPLATE THAT CMS PUTS OUT FOR STATES IS THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT THEIR WAIVERS. THE NEXT IS ELIGIBILITY AND REALLY CAN GO IN TWO DIRECTIONS STATES HAVE USED THAT AND THEIR ABILITY TO EXPAND. IT TO WAVE ELIGIBILITY TO EXPAND COVERAGE THEY CAN ALSO GO IN A MORE RESTRICTIVE WAY WHERE SOME STATES HAVE IMPOSED TIME LIMITS ENROLLMENT CAPS. UNCERTAIN POPULATIONS AND I STATES MAY ALSO I WAVED THE REQUIREMENTS FOR PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY AND RETROACTIVE COVERAGE. FOR BENEFITS AND SERVICES. AGAIN STATES HAVE USED THAT KIND OF AUTHORITY TO VARY BENEFITS PARTICULARLY FOR AYE IS THEY EXPANDED COVERAGE TO NEW POPULATIONS THEY MIGHT HAVE IMPOSED NEW THINGS LIKE. PREMIUMS WITHIN CERTAIN LIMITS OR BURIED THE BENEFITS. FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS. COST SHARING CAN BE WAIVED BUT WITH SOME SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTIONS IN THE LA. THERE ARE REQUIREMENTS THAT COST SHARING. IN THE FORM OF DEDUCTIBLES AND COPAYS. MOSTLY BE ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS STATES ARE SUPPOSED TO ONLY IMPLEMENT THOSE FOR TWO YEARS THERE ARE YOU AGAIN THERE IS SOME FLEXIBILITY TO IMPOSE COST SHARING ABOVE. CURRENT STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS BY. THOSE PROVISIONS THAT IT CANNOT BE WAIVED ENTIRELY. THE DELIVERY SYSTEM. AT ONE THAT STATES HAVE WAVES AND IN TERMS OF FREEDOM AND CHOICE PARTICULARLY. WHEN THINKING ABOUT MANAGED CARE AND OTHER TYPES OF. OF. CHANGES THEIR. AND THEN IF FINANCING REIMBURSEMENT WHICH IS OFTEN A CORE PART OF ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER AUTHORITY WHERE THE STATE IS ASKING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR SOMETHING THAT THEY WOULDN'T NORMALLY PAY COSTS THAT ARE NOT OTHERWISE MAGICAL. AND SO I. AGAIN WITH CONSTRAINTS ON BUDGET NEUTRALITY IS A BIG PART OF WAIVERS BUT I. DID BUT UNDER ELEVEN FIFTEEN AUTHORITY MANY STATES HAVE GOTTEN AUTHORITY TO GET. COVERAGE FOR THINGS THAT OTHERWISE WOULD NOT A THING. SO WHILE THAT'S ALREADY IN. MEDICAID ISRAEL IS QUITE BROAD THERE ARE SOME RESTRICTIONS. I'M WHAT CANNOT BE WAIVED. UNDER THE STATUTE AND ONE OF THE FIRST. AT KEY ONES IS THE FEDERAL MEDICAL ASSISTANCE PERCENTAGE OR F. MAP THAT FORMULA THAT IS REALLY THE SPLIT BETWEEN WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE STATE OUR PAIN. I'M IT VARIES ACROSS THE STATES AND IT DOES VERY. IN PARTICULAR FOR CERTAIN SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA. FOR MOST SERVICES LESS COVERAGE IT'S FIFTY PERCENT. ANOTHER IMPORTANT PROVISION. OF NOTE THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED IF THE F. MAP CLAIMING PROPHECIES. AND WHAT I MEAN THERE IS THAT WHILE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN WAVE WHAT CAN BE MATCHED. IT'S STILL. IT IT IT'S STILL NEEDS TO BE A MATCHING DOLLAR SO IN OTHER WORDS THE STATE PUTS UP FUNDS AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MATCHES THOSE FUNDS. SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE DO NOT THINK I CAN BE WAIVED UNDER THE STATUTE. EVER END UNDER THE ELEVEN FIFTEEN AUTHORITY THEIR OTHER PROVISIONS I MENTION THE COST SHARING REQUIREMENTS THAT THERE ARE RESTRICTIONS ON HOW MUCH COST SHARING CAN BE WAIVED. INCOME COUNTING ROLES SO FOR THE COR POPULATION COVERED UNDER THE ACA. SO NOT THAT DISABLED AND I'M. AND NOT AT THE ELDERLY THERE ARE. RESTRICTIONS ON CHANGING HOW INCOME IS COUNTED AND AND ASSETS TEST CANNOT BE IMPOSED. SO THOSE ARE KIND OF AN OVERVIEW OF SOME OF THAT THAT KEY PROVISIONS. AND YEAH I I THINK YOU ALL HAVE WITH YOU THAT WE JUST FINISHED A PAPER FOR THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION. THAT LOOKS AT THE LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS AND AND WE TALK ABOUT SINGLE PAYER BUT WE ALSO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER PROPOSALS THAT YOU MIGHT. CONSIDER PUBLIC OPTION ANOTHER AFFORDABILITY PROPOSALS AND. I WOULD LEAVE YOU WITH AND THE MEDICAID SIDE ONE IMPORTANT NOTE AND JULIET MADE THIS POINT. THAT WAIVERS ARE DISCRETIONARY AND YOU KNOW I'VE GIVEN YOU AN OUTLINE OF SOME OF THE PROVISIONS THAT ARE SEEN. EXPECTED. TO NOT BE WAIVED IN THOSE THAT CAN BE WAIVED. AND IT'S TYPICALLY THE CASE THAT ONCE SOMETHING HAS BEEN WAIVED THAT THAT IS PERMITTED BY. FUTURE ADMINISTRATIONS I'M BUT WE DO NOTE THAT. DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATIONS. CERTAINLY HAVE DISCRETION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GOING TO APPROVE WAIVERS. SO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WAIVERS ARE DISCRETIONARY. SOFT UP WITH MEDICAID AND NOW SWITCH GEARS AND TALK ABOUT THE MARKETPLACE. AS YOU KNOW THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. FIVE IT WAS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN AND EXPANDED COVERAGE AYE GIVING STATES MORE FLEXIBILITY TO. ESTABLISH EXCHANGES AND OF COURSE CALIFORNIA EX OF THAT STAB WISH COVERED CALIFORNIA. GAVE A. SIGNIFICANT. STEWART WAIVER AUTHORITY UNDER SECTION THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO STATE AND. WAIVERS AND WE'RE JUST STARTING GET EXPERIENCE WITH THESE WAIVERS. THE BULK OF THE ACA STARTED IN. TWENTY FOURTEEN. AND I REALLY THIS WAIVER AUTHORITY JUST KICKED IN IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN SO WE'RE STARTING GOT OUR FIRST TASTE OF WHAT ADMINISTRATIONS WILL APPROVE UNDER THIS AUTHORITY. AS I MENTIONED IT'S IT'S FAIRLY BROAD. THE STATE'S CAN. A PROPOSED A WAVE FOUR KEY PARTS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WHICH WE ALL KNOW WAS RECENTLY ALTERED BY AND. BE A BY THE CONGRESS AND SIGNED INTO LAW THAT THE PENALTY IS NOW REDUCED TO ZERO BUT THAT IS STILL IN THE STATUTE A PART OF THE. A. STATUTE THAT STATES CAN WAVE AS WELL AS THE EMPLOYER MANDATE IS ALSO A PROVISION THAT STATES CAN WAIVE THE FEE CHOOSE TO. BENEFITS AND SUBSIDIES SO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT CREATED THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFIT REQUIREMENT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE WAIVED UNDER THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO AUTHORITY. AS CAN THE SUBSIDIES THEIR PREMIUM TAX CREDITS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE BETWEEN THREE HUNT EXCUSE ME ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL TO FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE FOUGHT FEDERAL POWERLESS. DE LEVEL. ARE ALSO AND FOR THE PROVISIONS THAT THE STATE'S CAN WAVE AND I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT IN A LITTLE MORE DEPTH BUT I KNOW THAT STATES CAN USE THOSE DOLLARS AND REPURPOSE THOSE. FOR ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES. AND ALSO EXCHANGE RULES SEE STATES CAN MODIFY OR ELIMINATE. EXCHANGE RULES IF THEY CHOOSE TO. A PARTICULARLY IF THEY'RE MAKING MAJOR CHANGES TO THE BENEFITS. CITIES. THERE ARE RESTRICTIONS ON. THE. THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO A WAIVER AUTHORITY. MOST SAID THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS BETTER IN THE A. C. A. ARE ACTUALLY NOT WAY ABLE SO THINGS LIKE EACH RATING. PROHIBITION ON. HEALTH STATUS IS GENDER EXCITER. THOSE ARE NOT WEAVERVILLE PROVISIONS UNDER THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO. AND THEN THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT STATUTORY GUARDRAILS WHICH ARE ALSO IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND AND WHEN THINKING ABOUT. THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO A WAIVER AUTHORITY. THE FIRST THE SCOPE OF COVERAGE WAIVERS MUST PROVIDE COVERAGE TO AT LEAST AS MANY PEOPLE AS THE ACA WOULD. IN ABSENCE OF THE WAIVER. I'D THE WAIVER MUST ALSO A PROVIDE COVERAGE THAT IS LEAST AS LEAST AS COMPREHENSIVE AS THE COVERAGE OFFERED A ON IT. THROUGH THE EXCHANGE THE WAIVER MUST PROVIDE COVERAGE AND COST SHARING PROTECTIONS AGAINST EXCESSIVE OUT OF POCKET SPENDING THAT IS AT LEAST AS AFFORDABLE. OF THE EXCHANGE COVERAGE AND THE WAIVER MUST NOT INCREASE THE FEDERAL DEFICIT INCLUDING CHANGES TO INCOME PAYROLL FOR EXCISE TAX REVENUE. AND SO I THINK YOU KNOW YOU CAN REALLY TELL FROM THE FIRST THREE THAT THOSE. RESTRICTIONS ARE REALLY ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT IF THE STATE IS GOING TO COME IN AND AND MAKE CHANGES UNDER THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO THAT THERE REALLY PROPOSING TO PROVIDE. ADDITIONAL BENEFITS AND. AT A REALLY COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE I KNOW THE DEFICIT NEUTRALITY DOES. EXTEND TO. IT YOUR YOUR EMPLOYMENT TO YOUR. TALKING ABOUT BOTH TREASURY AND HHS WHEN THINKING ABOUT DEFICIT NEUTRALITY AND IT'S. IT IS A DIFFERENT STANDARD THAN WHAT WE'VE SEEN ON IN THE BUDGET NEUTRALITY. IN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM BECAUSE THAT'S. A LITTLE BIT BROADER. SO THIS NEXT SLIDE JUST GIVES YOU AN OVERVIEW OF SOME OF THE KEY. WAIVERS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED BY STATES. UNDER THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO AND DEFINITE COUPLE OF. PROPOSALS THAT WOULD HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE EAST CA. HOWEVER WE REALLY HAVEN'T SEEN AN APPROVAL YET. OF THE MAJOR MAJOR CHAINS MOST OF THE WAIVERS THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED FALL INTO THIS CATEGORY OF REINSURANCE AND THOSE OF THE WAIVERS. AT THE BOTTOM ALASKA OREGON MINNESOTA. ARE THE ONES WITH. AT WITH. APPROVED REINSURANCE WE VARIOUS AND WHAT WE SEE IN THESE WAIVERS IS THAT THE STATE HAS PROVIDED SOME FUNDING TO HELP COVER A PORTION OF HIGH COST CLAIMS FOR HIGH COST INDIVIDUALS. IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET AND THIS REALLY LOWERS PREMIUMS FOR PEOPLE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE EXCHANGE. AND IT'S REALLY I THINK I WORTH NOTING WHEN TALKING ABOUT AFFORDABILITY UP PROPOSALS TO LOOK A LITTLE BIT AT REINSURANCE A NUMBER OF STATES ARE CONSIDERING IT. REINSURANCE PARTICULARLY BENEFITS THOSE WHO GET COVERAGE IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET AND WHO DO NOT QUALIFY FOR TAX CREDITS. SO. FOR SOME OF THE STATES THAT ARE CONSIDERING PROPOSALS BECAUSE THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT PREMIUMS THE TAX CREDITS REALLY DO ASSIST INDIVIDUALS. WHEN PREMIUMS INCREASE BUT REINSURANCE IS ONE OF THE STRATEGIES. THAT STATES ARE CONSIDERING. TO TRY TO LOWER PREMIUMS OVERALL AND WHEN A STATE DOES THAT THEY BENEFIT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THEY AYE TAX CREDITS ARE LOWER THAN THEY WOULD BE OTHERWISE AND SO THROUGH THESE ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVERS STATES BEEN ABLE TO GET. FEDERAL FUNDING TO HELP OFFSET THE COSTS AND THE AMOUNTS HAVE A HAVE VARIED A BIT BASED ON CONDITIONS WITHIN THE STATE'S. BUT ON THE STATE'S OBSCENE AND SOME OF THEIR COSTS OFFSET. UNDER THESE REINSURANCE WAIVERS. SO. THINKING AGAIN A LITTLE BIT MORE BROADLY. L. AGAIN ELEVEN AT THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO AUTHORITY IS PRETTY BROAD WHERE STATES COULD TOTALLY RE PURPOSE. THOSE FUNDS AND USE THEM IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE'RE SEEING WITH THE REINSURANCE WAIVERS THEY'RE GETTING PASSED THROUGH FUNDING WHICH IS THEY'RE MAKING SOME KIND OF CHANGE TO. I'D THE ACA AS IT IS AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS GIVING THEM AS SOME SAVINGS AS A RESULT OF THAT SO. JUST TO KIND OF DISPUTE DRAW DISTINCTION BETWEEN TOTALLY RE PURPOSING THE DOLLARS VERSES ON A PROPOSAL THAT ACTUALLY ACHIEVE SAVINGS TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THERE REALLY ARE TWO DIFFERENT APPROACHES THAT STATES COULD THINK ABOUT WHEN THINKING ABOUT THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO WAIVER AUTHORITY. ANOTHER IMPORTANT POINT AGAIN IS JUST THE DEFICIT NEUTRALITY IS A LITTLE BIT BROADER THAN JUST WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE TAX CREDITS. THE TREASURY IS LOOKING AT. OTHER PARTS OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND IT'S ABOUT THE OVERALL COSTS NOT HER INDIVIDUAL. AND AGAIN WE HAVE LIMITED EXPERIENCE THERE BEEN A COUPLE OF WAIVERS SOME OF THEM WITH WITHDRAWN. SO WE DON'T HAVE A FULL SENSE OF WHAT MIGHT BE A APPROVED. BY THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION OUR FUTURE ADMINISTRATIONS. IN THE GUIDANCE ITSELF IT DOES NOTE THAT THAT HHS AND TREASURY CAN REJECT A WAIVER EVEN IF IT MEETS THE FOR GUARD RAILS SO. JUST IMPORTANT TO KNOW. AS THE IN TERMS OF THINKING THROUGH THE WAIVER AUTHORITY. SO AS I SAID IN OUR PAPER WE TALK IN MORE DEPTH ABOUT. MANY OF THE COVERAGE PROPOSALS CERTAINLY. SINGLE PAPER YOU SINGLE PAYER AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER REALLY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS I JUST LEAVE YOU WITH. THESE THOUGHTS THERE'S CONSIDERABLE FLEXIBILITY FOR. WAIVERS IN BOTH MEDICAID AND MARKETPLACE COVERAGE. BUT YOU KNOW SOME OF YOUR PROPOSALS MAY TEST NEW IDEAS AND SO. YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE AS MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH WHETHER HOW ADMINISTRATION WILL. WILL PERCEIVE THOSE THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH SHOULD QUESTIONS FOR OUR PANEL. I HAVE. START WITH. I'M. THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS SO I WANNA ASK ALL OF THEM AND I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHO TO ADDRESS TWO. BUT. YOU KNOW WE KNOW THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS NOT WORKING AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK AT ALTERNATIVES. EVERYTHING FROM YOU KNOW THE COVERAGE AVAILABLE BEING RESTRICTED IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS YOU KNOW AS FAR AS THE PATIENT. EX AGAIN CARE THEY MAY NEED. WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH HOOPS AND ALL KINDS OF BUREAUCRACY. AND ACTUALLY ACCESS COVERAGE IS WORTHLESS WITHOUT ACCESS SO YOU KNOW I'M HOPING THAT AS WE REALLY. MOVES FORWARD TO TRY TO CREATE A PLAN FOR CALIFORNIA THAT WE ACTUALLY SOLVE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS. THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING. CURRENTLY I'M ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAD IS. WE KNOW THAT GENERALLY THE GOVERNMENT PLANS HAVE NOT INCLUDED LONG TERM CARE. VISION OR DENTAL. WOULD THAT BE. IT ARE IS ANYONE DOING THAT IN THEIR STATE YOU KNOW OPTIONS OR. HILL COULD THAT BE. PART OF A. YOU KNOW AND UNIVERSAL. A PLAN THAT WE PUT FORWARD. AND I. THERE IT AT THAT. AREA RIGHT A SO I THINK VISION AND DENTAL IN PARTICULAR ARE. AREAS THAT I THINK A NUMBER OF STATES FIRE. SEE IS PRIORITIES. AND. AND. DO AND THINK ABOUT HOW THEY CAN PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR THOSE TWO I TO. FIND THE MARKETPLACE SIDE. THAT ESTATE. IT IT DOWN IT SP CAN EXPAND THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFIT PACKAGE IN THE SENSE OF IF THE STATE WANTS TO REQUIRE BENEFITS ABOVE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THEY CAN DO SO THE ISSUE IS SHOW US. THAT THEY NEED TO DO IT USING STATE FUNDS SO ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOESN'T. AT IT IS IS THAT FUNDING AS. ON THE MEDICARE SIDE. AS I MENTIONED. UNDER SECTION FOUR OH TO THERE IS AN OPTION TO TASK TO THE ADDITION OF BENEFITS UNDER MEDICARE THAT AREN'T THAT AREN'T CURRENTLY PAID FOR BY MEDICARE. THAT COULD INCLUDE THINGS LIKE VISION AND DENTAL SERVICES. BUT BECAUSE THE SECTION FOR AU TO AUTHORITY RELATES TO. PAYMENT FORSERVICES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY AND THE ECONOMY OF THE PROGRAM THOSE AT THEIR WORDS IN THE STATUTE. I THINK IT WOULD BE A STRETCH TO FIT LONG TERM CARE. UNDER THAT AUTHORITY. PRIMARILY BECAUSE IT'S SUCH AN EXPENSIVE. SERVICE. IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE A SCENARIO WHERE ADDING THE LONG TERM CARE BENEFIT. ACTUALLY LOWERS COSTS AND NOT REALLY IS A HIGH BAR FOR A BENEFIT LIKE LONG TERM CARE VISION AND DENTAL I THINK MAYBE. LESS OF A STRETCH. PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THEY CAN BE VERY ESSENTIAL TO QUALITY OF LIFE AND AND MIGHT ACTUALLY YOU KNOW IMPROVE PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO GET ABOUT ACCESS SERVICES KIND OF. LIVE THEIR DAILY LIVES. BUT BUT LONG TERM CARE AND MEDICARE ARE OBVIOUSLY TWO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS. AND YOU KNOW BECAUSE LONG TERM CARE IS A MEDICAID BENEFIT NOT A MEDICARE BENEFIT IT TYPICALLY HASN'T REALLY BEEN WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF MEDICARE TO CONSIDER. REFORMS THAT MIGHT AND LONG TERM CARE TO THE MEDICARE BENEFIT PACKAGE. AND I WOULD JUST ADD IN CALIFORNIA MEDI CAL DOES COVER A LONG TERM CARE. OF COURSE THAT'S THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM. AND. AND IN TERMS OF THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS BENCHMARK THE CALIFORNIA HAS SET FOR. THE MARKETPLACE PLANS ON CURRENTLY. ADULT A DENTAL BENEFITS FOR EXAMPLE ARE NOT INCLUDED SO. THAT YOU KNOW SO ON THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS BENCHMARK PLAN THAT CHIQUITA WAS REFERRING TO EARLIER THAT IS THE AVENUE BY WHICH YOU COULD EXPAND. WHAT IS CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS ON THE FLOOR FOR CALIFORNIA? OKAY I'M JUST A QUICK FOLLOW UP TO. THEM. IN ONE OF OUR PREVIOUS HEARINGS. WE DISCUSSED COST CONTAINMENT AND WHEN WE. HEARD ABOUT THE DIFFERENT PLANS AND OTHER STATES. IN THEY WERE GIVING ADVICE ON YOU KNOW HOW. SET UP YOU WANNA DO COST CONTAINMENT UP FRONT BECAUSE. SOME OF THE STATE'S THAT HAD GONE DOWN THE ROAD. FOUND THEY WEREN'T REALLY EXPERIENCING SAVINGS AND MAYBE EVEN HAVE. ADDITIONAL COSTS. HOW WOULD YOU RECOMMEND WE GO ABOUT STREAMLINING EFFICIENCIES? AND THE BUREAUCRACY I MEAN YOU KNOW WE HAVE ALREADY IN THE SYSTEM THAT IS. WHAT'S SPECIFIC GOALS SHOULD WE BE LOOKING FOR. AS WE LOOK TO A PLAN FOR CALIFORNIA THAT WOULD HELP. IN THE COST CONTAINMENT HOA BE ACCOUNTABLE NOSES GOES DOWN THE LINE WHO IS ACCOUNTABLE. IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS IT YOU KNOW. THE SIR I'M. SOMEBODY THAT. AND WILL BE LOOKING AT THAT. AND WHO THE LA AU PAIR. I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO BEGIN TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION IT'S OBVIOUSLY A CENTRAL QUESTION IN. DISCUSSIONS ABOUT YOU KNOW TRANSFORMING OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. YOU KNOW CLEARLY WITHIN MEDICARE I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY GOALS OF THE INNOVATION CENTER THAT IT WAS IT WAS SET UP. TO TRY TO TEST THESE NEW MODELS OF PAYING FOR CARE RECOGNIZING THAT. YOU KNOW THE WAY WE DO IT NOW IS NOT. WORKING SO WELL FOR EVERYBODY IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT EVEN WORKING SO WELL WITHIN MEDICARE AND I THINK THAT'S WHY. CMS HAS BEEN OR YOU KNOW AT LEAST HAD BEEN PRETTY AGGRESSIVE IN TRYING TO TEST A LOT OF DIFFERENT NEW IDEAS IT'S KIND OF LIKE THROW EVERYTHING AT THE WALL AND SEE WHAT STICKS. BUT IT'S IT'S ALSO A STRUGGLE I THINK. TOOK TO FIND SAVINGS TO SOME EXTENT WHEN YOU'RE TESTING SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS. YOU KNOW AS AS I SHOWED AND IN THAT ONE SLIDE ALL THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES THAT ARE BEING TESTED WITHIN THE INNOVATION CENTER THERE IS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INNOVATIVE ACTIVITY GOING ON AT THE STATE LEVEL AT THE PROVIDER LEVEL. AT LOTS OF DIFFERENT LEVELS WITHIN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. AND SO WHILE THAT'S GREAT. IT ALSO MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO REALLY UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT IT IS THAT'S HAVING AN EFFECTIVE FOR ACTUALLY SEEING SAVINGS WHICH IS ALSO WHY THEY. THE INNOVATION CENTER REALLY TRIES VERY CAREFULLY TO SET UP EVALUATIONS. SEC TEST. YOU KNOW THERE THE MODEL VERSES VIENEN NOT MODEL TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT IS WORKING AND A MODEL OR WHAT'S NOT WORKING. SO THAT WE KNOW WE DON'T INVEST FURTHER RESOURCES AND THINGS THAT DON'T WORK. SO THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR IDEAS LIKE PATIENT CENTERED MEDICAL HOMES AND ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATIONS AND. I PROVIDERS TALKING TO EACH OTHER AND NOT ORDERING DUPLICATIVE TESTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT THESE THINGS ARE ALL GREAT IDEAS BUT THEY DO TAKE A LOT OF TIME TO. BUILD UP TO GET PROVIDERS TO TO WORK TOGETHER AND AND SPEAK TO EACH OTHER. AND TO GET PATIENTS INTO THE SYSTEM AS WELL AND TO REALLY MAKE THE MOST OUT OF THIS TYPE OF COORDINATED CARE SYSTEM SO I DON'T KNOW THAT'S ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION DIRECTLY BUT THERE'S CLEARLY A LOT OF INTEREST. IN PURSUING. BETTER WAY TO YOU KNOW BRING ABOUT PAYMENT REFORMS AND DELIVERY SYSTEM REFORMS SO TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU HAVE GOALS THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN ACHIEVING. THAT REQUIRE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO TEST THEM IN MEDICARE AND MEDICAID AND THE MARKET. WILLING PARTNER. IN CM MASS. BUT YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO THINK THROUGH VERY CAREFULLY WHAT YOUR GOALS ARE AND THE TARGET POPULATIONS THAT YOU HAVE IN MIND. TO DEVELOP VERY SPECIFIC. THINGS THAT YOU WANT TO TEST. IN TERMS OF ACHIEVING SAVINGS AND IMPROVING QUALITY WITHIN. THE CONTEXT OF THOSE PRO. I. JUST I HAVE A LOT BUT I'LL JUST DO ONE AND THEN SAVE IT FOR THAT THE NEXT HEARING HOW. AT ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS IS. PATIENT TRYING TO NAVIGATE. YOU KNOW THE WHOLE PROCESS AND YOU KNOW I JUST LOOK AT. PEOPLE I KNOW HAVE TO GO AND THEN YOU KNOW THEY GO TO PRIMARY CARE BUT THERE IMMEDIATELY REFER. AND THEN THEY HAVE A NEED BUT THE SPECIAL SAY SEND THEM TO NEVER. GIVES THEM THE THING THAT THE INITIAL REQUEST WAS FORMED IN THE BACK WITH THE PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR IN THEIR QUESTIONING WHY THAT'S IN HAPPEN THEY CAN'T FIND THE FILE WITH ALL THE TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE RIGHT NOW THEY COULDN'T FIND THE PATIENT'S FILE. AND THEN YOU GET THE BILLS IN THE MAIL ANNUAL WILL I HAVE INSURANCE HOW COME I'M GETTING THIS BILL AND. YOU KNOW JUST FOR ME PERSONALLY HAVING GONE TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM LAST YEAR WHEN DURING SESSION. FOR A. ANALOGY. SOMETHING AND IN THE I WAS ALLERGIC TO. EXCEPT FOR THE TECHNICIAN AT THE DOOR NO ONE EVEN LOOKED AT ME THE DOCTOR SHOOK MY HAND ON THE WAY OUT AND THEN I GOT A THREE THOUSAND DOLLAR BILL. AND I FOUND OUT THAT. THE DOCTOR HAS TO PAY THE HIGH IN ORDER FOR THE TECHNICIAN TO GET PAID A LITTLE BIT. AND THIS IS A WHOLE LOT OF BUREAUCRACY IN. NO AS WE GO DOWN THIS ROAD I. REALLY WANT US TO MAKE SURE WE. SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON THE COST CONTAINMENT PART THIS ONE. THANK YOU. FIRST I'D LIKE TO JUST THANK THE PANEL HEALTHCARE IS AWFULLY COMPLICATED AND UNDERSTANDING WHERE SOME OF THOSE ROADBLOCKS ARE IS BENEFICIAL. I WANTED TO SEE IF I COULD FIND THE NEEDLE WITHIN THE HAYSTACK THOUGH AND DOCTOR COMMANDS CAN. A LITTLE BIT ON. UNDER YOUR CATEGORIES FOR INNOVATION CENTER MODELS. YOU NOT GLOSSED OVER THE STRONG STARTS FROM MOTHERS AND NEWBORN INITIATIVES AND. I HAVE QUITE AN INTEREST IN THIS BOTH BECAUSE I HAVE A TWO FIVE AND SIX YEAR OLD AT HOME BUT ALSO IN. TRYING TO IMPLEMENT A HOME VISITING PROGRAM HERE IN OUR STATE AND WANT TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR. SO I DIDN'T REALLY TALK MUCH ABOUT THOSE OTHER CATEGORIES TO SOME EXTENT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT AS FOCUSED ON MEDICARE. THAT SAID. CLEARLY YOU KNOW BASED ON THE. THE CATEGORIES THAT THE INNOVATION CENTER IS PURSUING AND EVEN IF YOU READ THE STATUTE THERE ARE A LOT MORE. OPPORTUNITIES. THAT ARE LISTED IN THE STATUTE AS FAR AS. MODELS THAT CAN BE TESTED. THERE IS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF ACTIVITY THAT THE STATE CAN PURSUE WITH REGARD TO THESE INNOVATION MODELS AND BY GLOSSING OVER IT I DIDN'T MEAN TO MAKE LIGHT OF IT. AYE I JUST MOSTLY I MEANT TO CONVEY THAT THAT'S TO SOME EXTENT OUTSIDE MY AREA OF EXPERTISE. BUT. BUT HE YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S VERY MUCH AN INTEREST WITHIN THE INNOVATION CENTER AT HEARING FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE IDEAS IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO BE A STATE IT CAN BE AN INDIVIDUAL PROVIDER. OR A PROVIDER GROUP. OR ANYBODY REALLY CAN CAN GO TO THE INNOVATION CENTER WITH AN IDEA. ABOUT HOW TO YOU KNOW IMPROVE QUALITY AND REDUCE SPENDING. WITHIN MEDICARE MEDICAID AND CHIP. AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THE STATE HAD COMES UP WITH SPECIFIC THINGS THAT. THAT IS THAT THEY'RE INTERESTED IN IF YOU HAVE SPECIFIC IDEAS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE. TO TRY TO TEST WITH THEN UP YOU KNOW THE STATE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM I THINK THE CMMI WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED IN HEARING. FROM FROM YOU ABOUT THOSE IDEAS AND I'M AND WORKING WITH YEAR TWO TO TRY TO MAKE IT WORK. SO FOLLOW UP A FIVE MAN OF HEART AND DIRECT SOMEONE ABSOLUTELY WILL WANTS TO. MAKE SURE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IF IF I CAN HOW MISS BROOKS WILSHIRE. YOU POINT OUT THAT THE STATE CANNOT GET A WAIVER FROM HER THAT MEDICAID F. MAP CLAIMING PROCESS ISN'T. SO IF CALIFORNIA HAS A PUBLICLY FINANCED HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS AS A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM. WHAT CALIFORNIA BE ABLE TO GET A WAIVER TO MORE EFFICIENTLY BILL THE? FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PRINT SHARE OF THOSE QUALIFIED FOR MEDICARE. IT SOUNDS AS THOUGH CALIFORNIA WOULD NEED TO RETAIN THE ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEMS AND FOR ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION AND OTHER RECORD KEEPING TO CAPTURE THE FEDERAL FUNDS IS THAT RIGHT. SO AND WE TALK ABOUT THIS MORE IN THE PAPER I THINK THEY'RE A COUPLE OF WAYS THAT CALIFORNIA COULD GO UP THE COULD GO. TO DRAWDOWN MEDICAID FUNDS THE ONE WAY WOULD BE CERTAINLY TO FOLLOW ALL THE MEDICAID RULES WHICH REALLY WOULD REQUIRE. AND UP FRONT ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION. AND IT MAY BE THAT TO THE CONSUMER TO PEOPLE IT'S NOT AS OBVIOUS. BUT THERE'S A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A BACK DOOR. ENROLLMENT PROCESS IN PLACE. THIS SECOND WAY THAT YOU COULD GO IS LOOK FOR FEDERAL FUNDS. IT IS LOOK FOR A FEDERAL WAIVER AND TRY TO GET SOME FLEXIBILITY ON THE ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION WE DO SAY THAT WE DO YOU THINK THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO DO SOME KIND OF ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION. THAT SENSE OF BUT IT MIGHT BE. A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT SO INSTEAD OF DOING IT UP FRONT MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU DO. AFTER PEOPLE ARE ALREADY ENROLLED. AND AND SO WE DO THINK THERE ARE SOME POSSIBILITIES THAT. THAT CALIFORNIA COULD TRY THAT APPROACH WE DO THINK THAT WOULD THAT THAT AT SOME POINT THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME KIND OF ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION. AND. YOU KNOW I'M THE. GO LEAVE IT THERE THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR EXPERTISE. THANK YOU AND. I AM. STRUGGLING TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND THIS ON SOME ASK YOU A COUPLE QUESTIONS FIRST OF ALL DE DO YOU HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF. HOW VERMONT PROCEEDED AND AND HOW FAR DID DATE YET? THROUGH A PROCESS OF OVERWEIGHT OF WAIVERS AND AND. DO YOU HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF THAT. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT VERMONT GOT SO FAR AS. TO TRIP UP ON THAT. HOW TO PAY FOR IT QUESTION AND DIDN'T ACTUALLY RESOLVE THE QUESTION OF WHAT TO DO WITH MEDICARE? SO I I BELIEVE THEY'RE IT WAS AN OPEN QUESTION AS TO HOW THE EXTENT TO WHICH. THEY WOULD INCORPORATE MEDICARE PARTICIPATION IN THEIR SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM AND IF THEY WENT DOWN THAT PASSED HOW THEY WOULD GO ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF SEEKING WAIVER AUTHORITY. THROUGH SECTION FOUR OH TO ARE THE INNOVATION CENTER. BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THOSE DETAILS GOT IRONED OUT SO UNFORTUNATELY THAT DOESN'T OFFER YOU. MUCH GUIDANCE. AT THIS POINT. SO IT WOULD GET IT OBVIOUSLY WAIVERS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE TESTING TESTING SOMETHING I. AND. THEY HAVE TO BE RENEWED. AFTER FIVE TYPICALLY. DO DOES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DO THEY SAY YOU KNOW WHAT WHOA WHOA WHOA WE'RE TWO YEARS INTO THIS. WE'RE GONNA. STOP THE WAVER ME DECIDE EVER HAPPENED OR. I I I DON'T DO DOES THAT HAPPEN I DON'T KNOW. SO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS. IS MONITORING THAT. AND THEY DO LOOK AT WAIVERS AYE THE AGAIN THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE. A FIVE YEAR PERIOD BUT THEY DO CHECK IN TO SAY. WITH THE STATE ON A YEARLY BASIS TO DO AN EVALUATION AND. AND LOOK TO SEE IF THINGS ARE GOING AWRY SO. I CAN'T THINK OF A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE IS ONE ISN'T ONE. WHERE THAT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ACTUALLY PULLED A WAIVER BEFORE THE FIVE YEARS THAT SOMETHING WE CAN LOOK INTO AND GET BACK TO YOU ON BUT BUT THERE IS? IT. REALLY IS A YEARLY LOOK TO SEE HOW THE STATE IS DOING BUT THEY ARE STILL EVALUATED. THAT THEIR VALUE WAITED OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD ON THE MEDICAID. I WOULD SAY ON THE MEDICARE SIDE AND AGAIN I KNOW YOU HEARD MORE IN FAR MORE DETAIL ON ON ALAN'S. WAIVER AND THEY'RE ALL PAYER MODEL BUT I BELIEVE THAT. YOU KNOW THAT WAS IT ORIGINALLY INCORPORATED IN STATUTE. AS BASICALLY YOU KNOW MEDICARE ALLOWING MARYLAND TO PAY HOSPITAL'S DIFFERENTLY THAN THE WAY MEDICARE NORMALLY PAYS HOSPITALS. BUT THAT WAS CONTINGENT UPON ACHIEVING SPECIFIC SAVINGS TARGETS. AND. YOU KNOW THAT THE PAYMENT MECHANISM WAS BASICALLY A PAYMENT PER HOSPITAL ADMISSION. AND MARYLAND REALIZED THAT THEY WERE AT SOME POINT NOT GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE ACHIEVING THOSE SAVINGS TARGETS AND THAT THAT THERE WOULD NOT HAVE THAT AUTHORITY RENEWED. THE SO THEY NEEDED TO. AND UNDERTAKE CHANGES TO THE THEIR AND IT ORIGINAL WAIVER WHICH IS WHICH RESULTED IN THE ALL PAYER MODEL THAT THEY NOW HAVE WHICH IS TRANSFORMING FROM THERE YOU KNOW PAYMENT PER ADMISSION TO MORE OF A GLOBAL PAYMENT. FOR A PATIENT FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR. SO IT IT'S TRANSFORMING RATHER THAN. YOU KNOW JUST PAYING A SPECIFIC RATE FOR HOSPITAL ADMISSION TRANSFORMING THE HOSPITAL'S INCENTIVES TO REALLY TRY TO KEEP PATIENTS OUT OF THE HOSPITAL. AS OPPOSED TO BRING THEM INTO THE HOSPITAL THE POINT IS THERE ORIGINAL WAIVER IS MORPHING FROM THE STATUTORY WAIVER TO THE CMMI INNOVATION CENTER AUTHORITY. AND THAT DOES HAVE TO BE RENEWED EVERY FOUR YEARS IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. THEY MAY BE MOVING AWAY FROM. YOU KNOW GRANTING SORT OF PERMANENT WAIVERS OR STATUTORY CHANGES TO THEY. YOU KNOW TRYING TO TEST THINGS AND DEMONSTRATE THINGS THROUGH THE THEY INNOVATION CENTER WITH REGARD TO MEDICARE PAYMENTS. WE THAT'S NOT THE CASE I THINK FROM MEDICARE IN A CA. BUT AGAIN YOU KNOW THEY'RE SO THE DRIVING INTEREST IS IS PROGRAM SAVINGS. AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU KNOW YOUR WAY FOR WHATEVER IT IS HOWEVER IT'S DESIGNED CONTINUES TO DEMONSTRATE PROGRAM SAVINGS. IT'S IT'S KIND OF HARD TO AS LONG AS QUALITY IS NOT SUFFERING. THEN I DON'T SEE WHY THE GOVERNMENT WOULD NECESSARILY STEP INTO POLITICAL ACT. IF THEIR SAVINGS THAT THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE OF THE PRIMARY GOALS SO. I'M THINKING ABOUT. THIS WOULD. OBVIOUSLY AT A MINIMUM THE REVIEW IF WE WERE TO MOVE TOWARDS A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM WOULD REQUIRE A MEDICAID WAIVER. AND MEDICARE WAIVER AT A MINIMUM BUT. I SENSE THAT IT'S MORE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY MORE COMPLICATED MEET IT FEELS LIKE MORE MULTIPLE WAIVERS WITHIN EACH OF THOSE CATEGORIES ARE MY MISSING SO. AT YOU WOULD I THINK YOU IF IT'S YOUR PROBABLY AMANDA MEDICAID WAIVER YOU'RE. GONNA NEED A THIRTEEN THIRTY TO WAVER ON THE MARKETPLACE SIDE. ANDS YEAH YEAH AND WHAT KIND OF AUTHORITY YOU NEED ON THE MEDICARE SIDE IS NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR. BUT IN ADDITION TO WHATEVER AUTHORITY YOU SEEK AS FAR AS THE WAY FOR. YOU'RE GOING TO NEED LEGISLATIVE CHANGE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IF THE SENATE ETHICS IT YEAH IT'S INCOMPLETE TO JUST SEEK A WAIVER. BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THE EXISTING AUTHORITY IS PRETTY BROAD. THERE'S NO READING OF THE STATUTE IN AT AS FAR AS I READ IT. TO ALLOW THE STATE TO SORT OF LAY CLAIM TO ALL OF THE MEDICARE AND TRUST FUND DOLLARS AND USE THEM. IN THE STATE'S HEALTH CARE PROGRAM. THAT DOESN'T REALLY COMPORT WITH THE EXISTING AUTHORITY THAT THE SECRETARY OF HHS HAS. SO FOR THAT YOU NEED LEGISLATIVE CHANGE IF YOU WANTED TO DO SOMETHING NOT QUITE AS COMPLETE AS SINGLE PAYER. LIKE MAYBE IN ALL PAYER SYSTEM THAT THERE IS LANGUAGE IN THIS STATUTE GOVERNING CMMI THAT DOES. ALLOW FOR OPPORTUNITIES FOR STATES TO TEST ALL PAYER SYSTEMS SO THAT I THINK IS AN AVENUE THAT YOU COULD PURSUE IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT THE SAME AS UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. BUT IT COULD GET YOU SOMEWHERE DOWN THE PATH TOWARDS PERHAPS DEALING WITH SOME OF THESE ADMINISTRATIVE COST ISSUES THAT YOU MENTIONED. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WALTER AND THAT. ARE REALLY KIND OF. PAIN IN THE* FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IN OUR CURRENT HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. REALISTICALLY. THE WAIVER PROCESS IN GENERAL FOR SOME OF THESE. INITIATIVES THAT HAVE GONE FORWARD. HOW LONG DOES SOMETHING LIKE THAT TAKE? AS I START THINKING ABOUT OKAY WE WANNA WANNA PUSH SOMETHING FOR YOU. HOW LONG? THIS WOULD BE A. AN ENORMOUS. LEFT I. ON ON OUR AND IS A STATE YES HOW LONG DEEP WITH THAT POTENTIALLY PROSPER SAYS POTENTIALLY TAPE. I WOULD SAY YEARS. AYE I THINK PROBABLY THAT YOU COULDN'T DO IT IN LESS THAN TWELVE MONTHS AND I WOULD SAY PROBABLY MORE LIKE TWO TO THREE YEARS. THAT'S AND I DO WANNA MENTION THAT IT YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE AN ELEVEN FIFTEEN MEDICAID WAIVER AS IT IS SO. AND THERE ARE QUITE A LOT OF. EXPERIMENTS BEING DONE UNDER ELEVEN FIFTEEN LIKE THE WHOLE PERSON PROGRAM THAT LOOKS AT DIFFERENT TYPES OF WAYS TO IMPROVE THE DELIVERY SYSTEM AND IMPROVE EFFICIENCIES WITHIN. MEDICAID AND EVEN WITH THE DUAL DUALLY ELIGIBLE PROGRAM SO FOLKS WHO HAVE BOTH MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SO. I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO MAKE SURE BUILDING ON ALL THE EFFORTS THAT WE HAVE. HAVE DONE SO FAR. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE. OWNER WERE BUILT ON SOME QUESTIONS A DOCTOR WOULD JUST ASK SO GIVEN THAT IT'LL TAKE TWO TO THREE YEARS. AND LET'S JUST. TALK ABOUT REAL POLITIQUE. AT THIS MOMENT WE'VE AN ADMINISTRATION THAT WOULD NOT BE OPEN TO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUT MAYBE AFTER TWENTY TWENTY WE WE MIGHT. WOULD IT MAKE SENSE FOR US TO APPLY. TO THREE ARE THE YEARS OUT BEFORE TWENTY TWENTY OR. OR IF YOU HAVE AN ADMINISTRATION THAT IS ADVERSE TO THE TYPE AWAY FROM WERE THINKING ABOUT. A APPLYING IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WHAT WITH THAT. WITH THAT. LACK OF SUPPORT STYMIE RIGHT UP THAT THE AT THE FRONT SUCH THAT IT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO APPLY FOR. THE WAIVER IF YOU DON'T HAVE A SYMPATHETIC ADMINISTRATION FROM THE BEGINNING. WELL I MIGHT START BY THE END BY THINKING AND I THINK SUSAN YOU WERE ALLUDING TO THIS THING ABOUT SOME OF THE STEPS THAT WOULD NEED WOULD BE NECESSARY AND THOUGHT THROUGH BEFORE EVEN GOING TO THE ADMINISTRATION SO JUST TO LOOK AT. ON THE MARKETPLACE SIDE TYPICALLY. PLANS NEED TO KNOW SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE WHAT COVERAGE IS GONNA LOOK LIKE SO YOU KNOW YOU WOULD WANT TO HAVE AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION MAKING A MAJOR CHANGE. ALMOST. DE. I NOW HAVE TIME FOR THE PLANS TO MAKE THAT KIND OF AND AN ADJUSTMENT AND ENOUGH TIME FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PROVE THAT SO WHEN YOU BACK INTO JUST A CHANGE THAT WOULD BE ON THE MARKETPLACE SIDE. YOU'RE REALLY THINKING ABOUT PROBABLY A YEAR BEFORE YOU WANT TO CHANGE JUST. EH AGAIN THINKING ABOUT A RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD POLICY BUT WHERE THE PLANS WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING. SO I MIGHT THINK ABOUT OKAY THAN ON THE MEDICAID SIDE IF WE'RE MAKING A MAJOR CHANGE HOW DOES THAT FIT IN WITH ALL OF THE OTHER. CHANGES THAT WE ALREADY HAVE BEEN MEDI CAL TIME AND AND AND. REALLY START THERE. BUT. IT IS SO THAT I WOULD WOULD BE MY SUGGESTION ABOUT PUBLIC THE FIRST PLACE TO START TO REALLY MAKE SURE OKAY WHAT'S WHAT'S ARE COHESIVE PLAN. MOVING FORWARD AND THEN THEN GETTING MAKING SURE YOU MOVED IT THROUGH. YOUR LEGISLATIVE BODIES. BEFORE STARTING THAT IS STARTING THE WAIVER PROCESS IT'S IT'S VERY POSSIBLE THAT THEY'LL BE ANOTHER ADMINISTRATION WHO IS MORE INTERESTED. IN SOME OF THESE POLICIES BUT IN SOME WAYS. THINGS NEED TO BE TESTED AND. SO I WOULDN'T I WOULDN'T SPECULATE ON WHETHER YOU WANT TO WAIT FOR THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION OR. OR ARE TESTED WITH THIS ONE. BRENDA GUESS I WOULD ADD TO THE EXTENT THAT. YOU KNOW AS I'VE MENTIONED. C. M. A MAIS AUTHORITY IS IS. TO SOME EXTENT PRETTY BROAD. SO IF YOU WERE INTERESTED AND PERHAPS PURSUING SOME INITIATIVES WITHIN THE EXISTING AUTHORITY OF CMMI THAT MAY LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR EXAMPLE ALL PAYER REFORM. THAT MIGHT GET YOU SOMEWHERE DOWN THE PATH TOWARDS A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM THE NOT COMPLETELY THERE. THAT MIGHT GIVE YOU SOME. YOU KNOW LEAD TIME TO DO SOME OF THE OTHER PLANNING THAT MIGHT NEED TO BE DONE FOR A MORE COMPREHENSIVE STATE BASED SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM. THAT YOU KNOW PERHAPS YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND AS MUCH OF A FRIENDLY AUDIENCE WITH THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION BUT YOU WOULD. IN A FUTURE ADMINISTRATION. IF YOU KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THE INNOVATION CENTER IS SEEKING YOU KNOW PROPOSAL'S UNDERNEATH AND ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATION. INITIATIVE FOR EXAMPLE THAT COULD BE SOMETHING. THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO PURSUE OR MORE TESTING WITHIN THE STATE INNOVATION MODELS. CATEGORY AND THERE ARE THOSE AVENUES THAT YOU COULD PURSUE INSTEAD OF JUST HOLDING OFF APPLYING FOR ANYTHING. DOING THINGS A LITTLE BIT MORE INCREMENTALLY MY. MIGHT HELP. GET YOU SOMEWHERE DOWN DOWN THE ROAD TOWARDS TOWARDS THE END GOAL. AND THEN IT JUST FALL BELOW BUT I THINK THE CONVENTIONAL PUBLIC WISDOM IS OR CONVENTIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF THIS IS THAT WE WOULD NEED TO GET WAIVERS FROM AND A PRESIDENTIAL MINISTRATION BUT I THINK WHAT YOU'RE LAYING OUT HERE IS. AND MANY INSTANCES OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SINGLE PAYER CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL SO IT'S IT'S NOT JUST SUPPORT FROM THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH FEDERALLY ITS SUPPORT FROM THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH AND AND CONGRESS. ON THAT BUT IN YOUR IN YOUR PRESENTATION YOU SAY THAT AS LONG AS THE MEDICARE CHANGES ARE ORIENTED AROUND IMPROVING QUALITY OR SPENDING REDUCING SPENDING A MEDICARE. IT'S A FAIRLY BROAD. DEFINITION BUT THEN YOU ALSO SEE BROADER CHANGES WOULD BE NEEDED FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM COULD WE DEFINE A PILOT LIKE FIVE YEAR. DEMONSTRATION OF WHAT SINGLE PAYER COULD LOOK LIKE IN CALIFORNIA AND HAVE THAT. BE CONSIDERED UNDER THIS BROAD DEFINITION OF WHAT WOULD COME UNDER MEDICARE WAIVER OR YOUR YOU THINK THAT IT'S HOW YOU SLICE IT AND DICE IT YOU REALLY WOULD NEED CONGRESSIONAL. I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE BUT I BUT I WOULD JUST BE A LITTLE BIT CAUTIOUS ABOUT. YOU KNOW THE PILOT IN TERMS OF HOW YOU'RE CHANGING. ENROLLMENT IN MEDICARE OR ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDICARE OR COST SHARING FOR EXAMPLE THOSE THINGS ARE ALL SPECIFIED IN STATUTE. AND THERE'S NO WAIVER AUTHORITY THAT ALLOWS STATES TO CHANGE THOSE THINGS. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU WANTED TO YOU KNOW. MAKE PEOPLE ON MEDICARE. HOLE IN TERMS OF NOT PAYING ANY COST SHARING OR PREMIUMS. THOSE THINGS ARE ALLOWED TO BE CHANGED BY STATES EVEN IF IT WOULD BE GREAT FOR A PATIENT PERSPECTIVE. THOSE THINGS ARE KIND OF SPECIFIED IN THE STATUTE. IT AND THIS HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE SO IT'S NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR TO ME THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD SAY NO BUT YOU REALLY HAVE TO BE VERY SPECIFIC AND DEFINING YOUR GOALS. AND DEMONSTRATING OVER THE COURSE OF WHATEVER THE WAIVER PERIOD IS THAT YOU ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS SPECIFICALLY REFER GUARD TO PROGRAM SAVINGS. AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS SO YOU KNOW I THINK YOU CAN CERTAINLY TRY TO BE AS CREATIVE AS POSSIBLE. BUT AGAIN IT COMES BACK TO IT'S A WAY FOR ITS TIME OMITTED IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT DESIGNED TO BE A PERMANENT CHANGE TO THE MEDICARE PROGRAM IT'S DESIGNED TO BE A PERMANENT CHANGE TO THE STATE'S HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S INTEREST IS IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. AND SO THAT THAT WILL BE THE LENS THROUGH WHICH THEY EVALUATE. WHATEVER THE STATE. PROPOSES TO DO AND WITH REGARD TO A PILOT OR SOME OTHER TYPE OF. I'M CHINA. INTERNET LISTEN TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND WONDERING AGAIN IF WE PROPOSED A PILOT. UP THAT CHANGED HOW MEDICARE. SPENDING WAS REDUCED OR QUALITY IMPROVED AND AND AND SAID OUR INTENT IS TO OBVIOUSLY DO SOMETHING MORE PERMANENT BUT FOR NOW WILL BRING INTO A FIGHTER PILOT SURE. AND I AM YEAH AND I THINK THAT CMS DOES ENVISION THAT TYPE OF MEDICARE PARTICIPATION IN THE STATE INNOVATION MODELS. INITIATIVE WITH WITHIN THE INNOVATION CENTER SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU AND I'D BE HAPPY TO CONNECT YOU WITH MORE INFORMATION SO THAT YOU CAN SEE. HOW ON THE ONE HAND? THE INNOVATION CENTER IS ENCOURAGING THAT THIS TYPE OF IDEA AND ON THE OTHER HAND HOLD STATES UP TO A VERY HIGH STANDARD WITH REGARD TO MEDICARE PARTICIPATION. IN STATE INNOVATION MODELS. AND I AND I MEAN I CAN TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE PRINCIPLES THAT THEY USE TO EVALUATE THE DIFFERENCE STATE INNOVATION MODELS WITH REGARD TO MEDICARE PARTICIPATION. BUT I THINK WHAT YOU BASICALLY NEED TO KNOW IS THAT WHILE IT'S POSSIBLE YOU CAN PROPOSE THIS TYPE OF. OF. PILOT TEST THERE'S OBVIOUSLY NO GUARANTEE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL APPROVE IT SO IT LEAVES YOU TO SOME EXTENT. AT YOU KNOW AT THEIR MY HALF THEIR MERCY IF YOU WELL. IN TERMS OF MOVING FORWARD AND JUST A BUT I GUESS STATISTICALLY HOW OFTEN ARE MEDICARE MEDICAID WAIVERS A TONIGHT. I DON'T KNOW THAT NUMBER OF NO I WOULD SAY THAT PLAYED ON THE MEDICARE SIDE OF LOOKED INTO HISTORICALLY A LOT OF THE MEDICARE WAIVERS WERE CONGRESSIONALLY. EITHER CONGRESSIONALLY MANDATED SO THEY THEY HAD TO HAPPEN. OR CMS. UNDERTOOK THEM OF THEIR OWN INITIATIVE SO THEY ALSO KIND OF HAD TO HAPPEN BECAUSE THE EN MASSE WAS RUNNING THEM. SO ON THE MEDICARE SIDE. IT HASN'T HISTORICALLY BEEN THE CASE THAT THEY'RE DENIED BECAUSE THE VIEW OF THE ENTITIES THAT ARE INITIATING THEIR WAY FURTHER DEMONSTRATION IS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ITSELF. IT'S DIFFERENT ON THE MEDICAID DIFFERENT ON THE MEDICAID SIDE AND I CAN'T I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW IF THAT STATISTIC IS KNOWN BUT SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO TELL IN THE SENSE THAT. THEN IF THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE GOING THE WAY THE STATE ONCE THEY MAY WITHDRAW THAT WAIVER IS THAT BECAUSE OF WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAID. YOU KNOW YOU CAN ALWAYS TELL WORSE SEEING THIS A LITTLE BIT WITH THAT THIRTEEN THIRTY TWOS WHERE SOME OF THE STATES HAVE PULLED BACK. I'M SO WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE ADMINISTRATION ACTUALLY DENY THEM ONE WAS DEEMED INCOMPLETE. THINK VERY MUCH. YOU. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH A FIGURE. NEXT I'D LIKE TO HAVE. BE ENTIRE PANEL OF SCOTT GRAVES BEN JOHNSON RYAN MILLER TO COME FORWARD AND I'M GOING TO START WITH CONCRETE DOCTOR GRAVES JOINED THE BUDGET CENTER IN TWO THOUSAND TWO AND I SERVED AS DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN. IN THIS ROLE HE OVERSEES THE BUDGET CENTERS ANALYTICAL WORK. CONDUCTS RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS RELATED TO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND CORRECTIONS. AND AS THE ORGANIZATIONS LEAD ANALYST ON THE STATE AND COUNTY BUDGET PROCESS THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR INVITING THE BUDGET CENTER TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS VERY IMPORTANT HEARING. SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO TODAY. OR THIS AFTERNOON. IS TO TRY TO MAINTAIN YOUR INTEREST FOR A FEW MINUTES IN OUR STATE CONSTITUTION BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR EVERYONE ON THIS COMMITTEE AND EVERYONE IN THE LEGISLATURE TO UNDERSTAND. THAT EFFORTS TO MOVE CALIFORNIA TOWARD UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. WOULD ENTAIL CONSTRAINTS THAT ARE BUILT IN OUGHT TO OUR STATE CONSTITUTION SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND OUT WHAT THOSE CONSTRAINTS ARE. AND HOW THE STATE MAY BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THEM. SO ONE STARTING POINT FOR THINKING ABOUT MOVING TOWARD UNIVERSAL COVERAGE IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT. SUCH COVERAGE WOULD VERY LIKELY REQUIRE TAX INCREASES I GUESS YOU COULD THINK THERE WOULD BE A WAY THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD CUT HERE OR THERE AND USE THAT SPENDING EXISTING EXPENDITURES TO FIND UNIFORMS WENT UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. WHAT'S MORE LIKELY IS THAT A TAX INCREASE WOULD BE REQUIRED AND IN FACT PRIOR ESTIMATES HAVE SHOWN THAT FOR EXAMPLE MOVING TOWARD A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM. COULD ENTAIL A TAX INCREASE OF WELL OVER ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS AND I BELIEVE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WILL BE SUBSTANTIATING THAT I'M IN A FEW MOMENTS. SO TAX INCREASES ARE POSSIBLE AS YOU KNOW AS LONG AS THE LEGISLATURE CAN MUSTER A TWO THIRDS VOTE OF EACH CHAMBER. HARM BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE ARE PROVISIONS WITHIN THE CONSTITUTION. THAT CONSTRAIN THE LEGISLATURE'S ABILITY. TO RAISE TAXES AND TO DEDICATE THE REVENUES TO PARTICULAR PURPOSES OKAY JUST RATHER THAN I'M ALLOWING THEM TO FLOW INTO THE GENERAL FUND SO WHAT I WANTED TO DO TODAY IS TO TALK ABOUT A COUPLE PROVISIONS IN PARTICULAR. ONE YOU ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT APPROVED BY THE VOTERS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT. WHICH AMENDED ARTICLE SIXTEEN SECTION EIGHT OF THE STATE CONSTITUTION I'M AND WAS LATER AMENDED BY PROPER LEVIN OF NINETEEN NINETY. I'M A SECOND PROVISION THAT YOU'RE PROBABLY LESS FAMILIAR WITH AT LEAST UP UNTIL THIS YEAR AMEND MAYBE LAST YEAR. IS PROP FOUR OF NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE WHICH ADDED ARTICLE THIRTEEN BE TO THE STATE CONSTITUTION AND ITSELF WAS LATER AMENDED BOTH BY PROP NINETY EIGHT AS WELL AS BY PROP ONE ELEVEN. SO. ARTICLE THIRTEEN BE ESSENTIALLY IS THE GANG LIMIT. AND I'LL BE GETTING INTO BOTH OF THOSE ISSUES. IN A MOMENT. SO. I CAN HAPPILY REPORT THAT I'M NOT GOING TO BE GETTING INTO THE COMPLEXITIES THE MECHANICS THE FORMULAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT OF MINIMUM FUNDING GUARANTEE I WILL JUST REMIND I'M ALL OF US IN THE ROOM. THAT IT ESSENTIALLY PROVIDES A MECHANISM ON FOR PROVIDING EACH YEAR A GUARANTEED LEVEL OF FUNDING TO K. TWELVE SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES I'M ALSO KNOWN AS K. FOURTEEN EDUCATION. SO THE KEY ISSUE HERE RELATED TO UNIVERSAL HEALTH COVERAGE IS THIS WOOD CAPE FOURTEEN EDUCATION BE REQUIRED TO RECEIVE A PORTION OF ANY TAX REVENUES. RAISED TO FIND UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. EVEN IF THE LEGISLATURE DECIDED TO DIRECT THOSE REVENUES INTO A SPECIAL FUND RATHER THAN INTO THE GENERAL FUND THAT IS ESSENTIALLY THE KEY QUESTION. ARM AROUND HOW PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT RELATES TO THE STATE'S OF EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. SO WHAT I WANT TO DO NOW IS SPEAK FROM THIS VERY SIMPLE GRAPHIC HERE. TO LAY OUT SOME OF THE ISSUES. THAT ARE PRESENT. IN VARIOUS DEBATES AROUND PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT SO THE FIRST THING TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT IN ARTICLE SIXTEEN SECTION ARE THE TERM A GENERAL FUND REVENUES IS USE THE TERM GENERAL FUND PROCEEDS OF TAXES IS USED WHEN TALKING ABOUT HOW THE PROP NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE GETS CALCULATED EACH YEAR. THE CONSTITUTION DOES NOT TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT SPECIAL FUND REVENUES. IN IN HAPPENED IN DISCUSSING ARE DESCRIBING HOW THE PROP NINETY EIGHT CALCULATIONS ARE INTENDED TO BE DONE. SO. THERE ARE VARYING INTERPRETATIONS. OF WHAT THIS ACTUALLY MEANS ONE INTERPRETATION. YOU MIGHT CALL IT THE STRONG INTERPRETATION ARGUES THAT BECAUSE SPECIAL FUND REVENUES ARE NOT MENTIONED. IN THE STATE CONSTITUTION IN THE CONTEXT OF NINETY EIGHT. AND BECAUSE GENERAL FUND REVENUES AND SPECIAL FUND REVENUES. ARE DISTINCT FROM ONE ANOTHER THEN SPECIAL FUND REVENUES WOULD NEVER COUNT IN CALCULATING THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT SPENDING GUARANTEE SO ONE EXAMPLE OF HOW THIS COULD WORK. THE LEGISLATURE TO PASS A TAX INCREASE INTENDED TO ACHIEVE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. IT COULD DIRECT THOSE REVENUES INTO A SPECIAL FUND. AND IT COULD PERMANENTLY EXCLUDE THOSE REVENUES FROM THE CALCULATION OF THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE EACH YEAR WHICHWOULD EFFECTIVELY MAIN THAT K. FOURTEEN EDUCATION WOULD DERIVE NO UP FINANCIAL BENEFIT FROM THE REVENUES REYES TO SUPPORT. UNIVERSAL COVERAGE SO THAT'S ONE VEHICLE OUT AND THAT VIEW WAS EXPRESSED IN A LAWSUIT VERY CLEARLY BY THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION IT WAS A LAWSUIT THAT WAS BROUGHT IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. GOT BY K. TWELVE SCHOOL OFFICIALS IN THE WAKE OF THE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN REALIGNMENT IN WHICH THE STATE SHIFTED VARIOUS PROGRAMS AND SERVICES TO THE COUNTIES ALONG WITH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. NEWS THAT PREVIOUSLY WERE GENERAL FUND REVENUES. BUT WERE SORT OF RE IMAGINED AS SPECIAL FUND REVENUES. THAT LAWSUIT WAS LATER MOVED BECAUSE PROPOSITION THIRTY PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WHICH ESSENTIALLY GAVE K. FOURTEEN EDUCATION BACK THE REVENUES THAT WERE LOST AS A RESULT OF THAT TRANSFERS OF THE WAS NEVER ANY CONTROLLING DECISION. THEY CAME OUT OF THAT LAWSUIT SO THAT'S THE FIRST INTERPRETATION THERE ON THE LEFT UP LOOKING DOWN AT THE OTHER BOX ON THE BOTTOM THE ONE ON THE RIGHT. THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER INTERPRETATION OF HOW TO THINK ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT AND I GENERAL FUND IN SPECIAL FUND REVENUES IN THIS INTERPRETATION. SORT OF ARGUES THAT THE GENERAL FUND AS USED IN THE CONSTITUTION SHOULD BE THOUGHT OF MORE BROADLY TO ENCOMPASS REVENUES THAT GO BEYOND THOSE THAT ARE DEPOSITED INTO THE STATE'S GENERAL FUND. EACH YEAR BY STATE LAW ARE AS REQUIRED BY STATE LAW SO THIS INTERPRETATION SHOWS UP FROM TIME TO TIME WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE IT WAS EXPRESSED IN THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE IS ANALYSIS OF SENATE BILL FIVE SIXTY TWO. WHICH AIM TO CREATE A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA SO IT WAS VERY CLEARLY EXPRESS THEIR. IT IT HAS ALSO BEEN IMPLIED IN A NUMBER OF BALLOT MEASURES THAT HAVE RAISE REVENUES FOR EXAMPLE EACH OF THE THREE BALLOT MEASURES THAT HAVE GONE TO THE VOTERS ASKING THEM TO INCREASE TOBACCO TAX REVENUES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT. NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT AND MOST RECENTLY IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN HAVE RAISED A STATES EXCISE TAX ON TOBACCO DEPOSITED THE REVENUES INTO A SPECIAL FUND. DIDN'T GO TO THE GENERAL FUND BUT IN EACH CASE THEY FELT THAT IT WOULD BE PRUDENT TO ADD LANGUAGE TO THEIR MEASURE THAT SAID BY THE WAY. A THESE ARE REALLY SPECIAL FUND REVENUES THEY'RE NOT ENTER DEPLETES DON INTERPRET THEM AS GENERAL FUND REVENUES SUBJECT TO THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE THEY FELT IT PRUDENT TO ADD THAT LANGUAGE. EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE RAISING AN EXCISE TAX AND DEPOSITING THE REVENUES INTO A BRAND NEW SPECIAL FUNDS. I'M GOING TO SKIP A FEW TECH SLIDES HERE AND GO. RIGHT TO THIS ONE I'M. GIVEN THE VARYING INTERPRETATIONS HERE I'M IT SEEMS TO US THAT THE STATE COULD BE VULNERABLE TO LEGAL CHALLENGES I'M IF IT DECIDED TO IF THE LEGISLATURE DECIDED TO RAISE TAXES. DEPOSIT THOSE DOLLARS INTO A SPECIAL FUND AND EXCLUDE THEM FROM THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT CALCULATIONS NOW LAWMAKERS ARE COULD ATTEMPT TO DISSUADE LIT AGAINST BY ADDING WHAT ARE CALLED POISON PILLS TO A BILL. I'M A POISON PILL WOULD ESSENTIALLY BLOW UP THE STRUCTURE WOULD SAY IF ANYONE SUES ON THE BASIS OF PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT AND THE STATE LOSES THAT LAWSUIT. THESE REVENUES WOULD AUTOMATICALLY GO AWAY ON THE LA AL POINTED OUT IN A REPORT RELEASED LAST YEAR. THAT THERE WERE FOR POISON PILLS THAT THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED IN THE LATE EIGHTIES AND EARLY NINETIES WHEN PROP NINETY EIGHT WAS RELATIVELY NEW. AND NO CONSEQUENCES EVER CAME FORTH FROM THEM AND OTHER WORDS THAT WERE NEVER LAWSUITS THAT SORT OF TESTED ON WHETHER SOMEONE WOULD TAKE IT ALL THE WAY SUE THE STATE AND ARGUE THAT THE REVENUE SHOULD INDEED BE COUNTED TOWARD THE NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE. SO A POISON PILL IS ONE WAY TO GO ANOTHER WAY TO GO IS TO SIMPLY SOMEPLACE ON TO THE BALLOT. A MEASURE THAT WOULD ASK CALIFORNIA'S VOTERS TO RAISE THE REVENUES NEEDED TO ACHIEVE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. AND IT TO EXCLUDE THOSE REVENUES EXPLICITLY FROM THE CALCULATION OF THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEES SO THERE MAY BE A LEGISLATIVE WAY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE THIS CONSTRAINT POSED BY THESE VARYING INTERPRETATIONS. BUT THERE'S ALSO MAYBE A MORE OBVIOUS WAY THAT'S BEEN USED MANY TIMES OVER THE DECADES WHICH IS TO SIMPLY GO TO THE VOTERS. AND PASSED UP WE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA TO AMEND OUR CONSTITUTION IN ORDER TO ALLOW REVENUES RAISED FOR UNIVERSAL COVERAGE I'M TO UNAMBIGUOUSLY BE USED FOR UNIVERSAL COVERAGE RATHER THAN ONLY SORT OF HAVING A CLOUD OVER YOUR HEAD. WONDERING O. OF SOMEDAY THIS MAY BE SUBJECT TO PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT AND WILL LOSE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THESE REVENUES. TO ANOTHER SERVICE AS OPPOSED TO K. FOURTEEN ARE AS OPPOSED TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. I'M GONNA SKIP TO THE NEXT ISSUE NOW WHICH IS PROPOSITION FOR AS I MENTIONED A PASSED ORIGINALLY IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE. ESSENTIALLY THIS IS A LIMITATION ON STATE AND LOCAL SPENDING AND I WANTED TO LAY OUT FIRST THE KEY ISSUE HERE I'M FOR YOU RELATED TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE WHICH IS. IF THE LEGISLATURE INCREASED TAXES TO ACHIEVE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. WITH THESE TAXES ESSENTIALLY BE SO HIGH THESE NEW REVENUES BUT THEY WOULD CAUSE THE STATE TO EXCEED ITS APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT WHAT IS. OFTEN KNOWN AS THE CAN LIMIT AFTER ONE OF THE AUTHORS OF PROPOSITION FOR IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE. SO I'VE GOT HERE. HOPEFULLY A RELATIVELY SIMPLE ILLUSTRATION I'M SORRY THERE EVEN FOR BOXES ON THEIR MORE TEXT THAN I WOULD HAVE LIKED. THIS IS MY EFFORT TO SORT OF DO STILL FOR YOU SO I DON'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THIS WITH TECH SLIDES THAT I'M GONNA SKIP THE NEXT THREE AFTER THIS BUT I JUST WANTED EVERYONE TO SORT OF BE ON THE SAME PAGE OF JUST ABOUT HOW BEGAN LIMIT WORKS. SO THAT THEN YOU CAN USE THAT TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER THIS WOULD AFFECT YOUR EFFORTS TO MOVE TOWARD UNIVERSAL COVERAGE IN CALIFORNIA SO THE FIRST THING THAT HAPPENS AND IT AGAIN LIMIT. IS THE STATE PASSED TO CALCULATE ITS ANNUAL LIMIT ESSENTIALLY THE LIMIT IS BASED ON SPENDING BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CERTAIN TYPES OF SPENDING BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT SEVENTY NINE SO YOU HAVE WE'RE SENSUALLY SETTING. OUR LIMIT BASED ON THE DISCO ERA EXPENDITURES OF CALIFORNIA DURING JERRY BROWN'S. PROBABLY HIS SECOND TERM AT THAT POINT MAYBE HIS FIRST TERM THE LIMIT IS ADJUSTED EACH YEAR FOR VARIOUS FACTORS SUCH AS THE POPPY THAT THE POPULATION GROWING CALIFORNIA. DO WE HAVE MORE KIDS THAT ARE K. TWELVE SCHOOL SYSTEM. DID OUR PER CAPITA PERSONAL INCOME GO UP ALL OF THOSE THINGS GET FACTORED INTO CALCULATING AND NEW LIMITS SO ESSENTIALLY EVERY YEAR YOU TAKE THE BASE WHERE YOU ARE. YOU APPLY THE ADJUSTMENT FACTORS AND YOU GET A NEW BASE THAT IS YOUR NEW BEGAN LIMIT EACH YEAR AND ALL LOCAL GUY I BELIEVE ALMOST ALL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN CALIFORNIA ARE REQUIRED TO GO THROUGH THE SAME EXERCISE EACH YEAR. THE SECOND THING THE STATE HAS TO DO IS TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATIONS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE LIMIT THAT WAS JUST CALCULATED SO A COUPLE IMPORTANT THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND HERE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT APPROPRIATIONS FROM WHAT ARE CALLED PROCEEDS OF TAXES TAX PROCEEDS WHETHER TAX PROCEEDS THERE THEY ARE THERE ARE VARIOUS THINGS THAT FACTOR INTO PROCEEDS OF TAXES I'M JUST GONNA TELL YOU THE MAIN ONE. WHICH IS REVENUES FROM. STATES GENERAL TAXES THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX SALES AND USE TAX THE CORPORATION TAX ALL THOSE BABIES FOR THE MOST PART THAT IS WHAT. ON THE PROCEEDS OF TAXES. ARE MADE UP BY THERE ARE OTHER REVENUES THEY GET FACTORED IN OKAY SO YOU HAVE PROCEEDS OF TAXES YOU NEXT STEP WITHIN THE SECOND BOX ON THE BOTTOM IS TO DECIDE. WHICH APPROPRIATIONS FROM PROCEEDS OF TAXES ARE SUBJECT TO THIS LIMIT BECAUSE NOT ALL APPROPRIATIONS ARE. BASED ON PROP FOR AN PROP ONE ELEVEN THE STATE GETS TO TAKE A LOT OF APPROPRIATIONS OFF THE TOP YOU DON'T COUNT REVENUES THAT YOU TRANSFER TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN THE FORM OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE THAT COUNTS TOWARD THEIR OWN GANG LIMITS. YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING WE'RE DOING IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAID WE HAD TO OUR COURT SAID WE HAD TO. YOU DON'T HAVE DEBT SERVICE. SO THOSE ARE THE THREE MAJOR ONES THERE ARE OTHER ONES THAT I'M I I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO BUT THE IDEA IS BEGAN LIMIT APPLIES TO CERTAIN APPROPRIATIONS. FROM TAX PROCEEDS EACH YEAR SO THEN WHAT DO YOU DO YOU GO TO STEP THREE BACK UP TO THE TOP NOW ON THE RIGHT. AND ESSENTIALLY YOU COMPARE YOUR LIMIT. TO THE EX TO THE EXPENDITURES OR THE APPROPRIATIONS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE LIMIT AND WHAT IS THE CONSTITUTION SAY HERE. IT SAYS THAT IF. YOUR EXPENDITURES ARE YOUR APPROPRIATIONS REACH YOUR LIMIT. ANY REVENUES REMAINING OVER THAT TWO YEAR PERIOD ARE CONSIDERED EXCESS REVENUES THE CONSTITUTION SAYS WHAT DO YOU DO WITH EXCESS REVENUES COMING DOWN A STEP FOR. HALF OF THEM GO TO PROP NINETY EIGHT IN THE FORM OF ADDITIONAL SPENDING AND HALF OF THEM GO BACK TO THE VOTERS TO TAX PAYER OR TO TO TAXPAYERS AS REBATES. THE LEGISLATURE HAD THE OPTION OF TAKING SOME OF THESE REVENUES AND SAY WELL WAIT A MINUTE MAYBE WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT EXACTLY WE'RE GONNA SPEND SOME OF THEM FOR NON. A REP FOR. APPROPRIATIONS THAT ARE EXEMPT FROM BEGAN LIMIT RIGHT AS I MENTIONED THAT NOT ALL APPROPRIATIONS APPLY RIGHT TO BEGIN LIMIT SO THERE ARE SOME THINGS YOU MAY BE ABLE TO SPEND SOME OF THOSE REVENUES ARE BUT THE HOPE FOR THE MOST PART. THE AUTOMATIC ANSWER THE CONSTITUTION GIVES IS IF WE SPEND UP TO OUR LIMIT. A COUPLE YEARS IN A ROW. ANY REVENUES BEYOND THAT LIMIT. FROM PROCEEDS TO TAXES GO BACK TO THE TAXPAYERS AND GO TO PROP NINETY EIGHT IN THE FORM OF ADDITIONAL SPENDING. SO WHY DID I TELL YOU ALL THAT. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT. RAISING REVENUES TO PAY FOR UNIVERSAL COVERAGE OUR EXPANDED COVERAGE IN CALIFORNIA. WOULD BE CONSIDERED PROCEEDS OF TAXES. AND WOULD GO TO SERVICE SAYS HEALTH CARE. THAT ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED FROM AGAIN LIMIT. THESE ARE ALL EXPENDITURES OR APPROPRIATIONS THAT WOULD BE COUNTED FOR THE GANG LIMIT NOW RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ACCORDING TO GOVERNOR BROWN'S DEPARTMENT FINANCE WE HAVE ABOUT TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS IN WHAT'S CALLED ROOM. UNDERNEATH THE LIMITIN OTHER WORDS WE'RE NOT AT THE LIMIT WERE BELOW THE LIMIT FOR THE APPROPRIATIONS THAT MATTER. WE HAVE TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS IN ROOM WHAT IF WE DECIDED TO DO SINGLE PAYER IN CALIFORNIA AND WE SOMEHOW GOT A TWO HUNDRED UP ABOUT TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR TAX INCREASE THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. AND APPROPRIATE A TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS TOWARD A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM I'M WHAT YOU CAN SEE HAPPENING IS YOU WOULD BY DEFINITION BE EXCEEDING AGAIN LIMIT BECAUSE YOU ONLY HAVE ABOUT TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS IN ROOM. SO ANYTHING THAT GOES BEYOND ANY APPROPRIATIONS FROM PROCEEDS OF TAXES THAT GO BEYOND TWELVE BILLION AT THIS POINT AND THE NUMBER MAY MOVE AROUND A LITTLE BIT. WOULD BE CONSIDERED ACCESS REVENUES AND WOULD HAVE TO BUY ACCORDING TO THE CONSTITUTION. GO BACK TO THE TAXPAYERS AND GO TO ADDITIONAL PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT SPENDING AND COULD NOT BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THE REVENUES WERE RAISED. IN OTHER WORDS UNIVERSAL COVERAGE SO. KEN THE LEGISLATURE IF IT WANTED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. AND IT'S A SIMILAR ANSWER TO WHAT I GAVE BEFORE I'M PROP NINETY EIGHT CALIFORNIA VOTERS ARE USED TO SEEING. A REQUEST TO AMEND OUR STATE CONSTITUTION IT HAPPENS EVERY TWO YEARS IT'S GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN THIS YEAR THE LEGISLATURE COULD ADVANCE A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. UP THAT NOT ONLY PASSED VOTERS TO RAISE THE TAXES NECESSARY TO FUND THE SYSTEM THAT EXCLUDES THE REVENUES SPECIFICALLY FROM THE PROP NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE IF IT WANTED TO DO SO BUT COULD ALSO ASK VOTERS TO REVISED AGAIN LIMIT IN SUCH A WAY. THAT THESE NEW EXPENDITURES THESE NEW APPROPRIATIONS WOULD NOT BELOW PASSED AGAIN LIMIT. AND BE COUNTED SORT OF AS EXCESS REVENUES NOT BEING ABLE TO BE USED ESSENTIALLY FOR UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. SO HOPEFULLY THAT WAS I I TRIED TO MAKE THAT AS CLEAR AS I COULD HOPEFULLY IT WAS YOU KNOW IT WAS CLEAR ENOUGH I'M I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS FIRST I WANTED TO GIVE YOU JUST A FEW CAN CONCLUDING THOUGHTS. IT'S THAT THAT THE FIRST KEY POINT TO KEEP THAT THE KEEP IN MIND HERE IS THAT. EFFORTS TO ITS AT THE PRICE AS A PROP NINETY EIGHT AND AGAIN LIMIT BOTH CONSTRAIN THE LEGISLATURE'S ABILITY. TO SORT OF ENACT MAJOR NEW. PROGRAM EXPENDITURES THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT APPLIES JUST TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF UNIVERSAL COVERAGE HERE BUT IF THE STATE WANTED TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IN HIGHER EDUCATION THE YOU SEE IN THE CS YOU. ARE IN AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE ON IN A RANGE OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES IT WOULD STILL BE DEALING. WITH THESE TYPES OF ISSUES I'M BRINGING THEM UP SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. I ALSO WANTED TO NOTE THAT SOME ADVOCATES SPECIFICALLY SOME MAP I'M PROPONENTS OF SENATE BILL FIVE SIXTY TWO. HAVE ASSERTED THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD ADDRESS THESE CONSTITUTIONAL CONSTRAINTS LEGISLATIVELY I'M WITHOUT GOING TO THE VOTERS WITHOUT CONSULTING THE VOTERS AND BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF YOU KNOW GOOD WORK THE LA HOW HAS DONE OF OUR READ OF THE STATE CONSTITUTION. OUR RESPONSE TO THAT IS ESSENTIALLY IT SEEMS VERY UNLIKELY THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD ADDRESS THE PROBLEM POSED BY THE CAMERAMAN. LEGISLATIVELY WITHOUT GOING TO THE VOTERS. AND THAT GOING AROUND PROP NINETY EIGHT COULD TRIGGER A LAWSUIT JUST BASED ON THESE VARYING INTERPRETATIONS PALM WHICH WOULD PUT. UNIVERSAL COVERAGE ANY NEW PROGRAMS AND SERVICES PUT ON CLICK PUT IN PLACE ON A VERY SHAKY LEGAL FOUNDATION WHICH IS PROBABLY NOT WHERE THE LEGISLATURE WOULD WANT TO BE WHEN IT'S ATTEMPTING UP TO PROVIDE. A RANGE OF ROBUST OF SERVICES IN THE HEALTH CARE AND ARENA TO CALIFORNIA AND SO. JUST THE BOTTOM LINE HERE. IF IT ASKING CALIFORNIA VOTERS TO REMOVE THESE CONSTRAINTS WOULD PROBABLY BE A BETTER WAY FORWARD AND I'LL CONCLUDE THEIR THANK YOU. I THINK IT'S OKAY WOULD LIKE TO. YOU DON'T TIRE FAN ALL OF THAT IF YOU'RE GOOD WITH THAT SO. OUR NEXT AND I AM SORRY I AM. BEN BEN JOHNSON IS GOING TO SPEAK TO US A. BEEN IS A. OF FISCAL POLICY IN THEM ANALYST WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE BEEN PLEASE. THANK YOU. YEAH SO A BEN JOHNSON AT THE LA AUTO. AND TO BRIEFLY TOUCH ON MY AGENDA OUR ARE ACTUALLY HERE I HAVE A HANDOUT THAT I BELIEVE WAS DISTRIBUTED YOUR PACKETS AND IT'LL FORM THE BASIS OF MY REMARKS. BRIEFLY GO OVER MY OUR OUR AGENDA HERE TODAY OF FIRST IN OPEN BY TOUCHING BRIEFLY ON HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AND EXPENDITURES UNDER THE EXISTING SYSTEM. IN THE STATE THEN PRESENT. ARE ELIA ANALYSIS OF A PUBLICLY FINANCED STATEWIDE HEALTH CARE PROGRAM. AND THEN FINALLY CONCLUDE ACTUALLY MY PORTION OF THEIR MUCH OF OUR REMARKS WITHOUT BY INTRODUCING ASSORTMENT OF POLICY APPROACHES TO EXTENDING COVERAGE TO THE REMAINING HONORS ON IN SHARED. THROUGH THE EXISTING HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THEN I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE BRIAN MILLER TO DISCUSS VARIOUS FINANCING CONSIDERATIONS AND OPTIONS. SO TURNING TO PAGE ONE OF THE HAND OUT. WOULD JUST THEM INITIALLY NOTE THAT NINETY THREE PERCENT. WELL WHICH OF A QUICKER. GREAT TURNING TO PAGE ONE. AT NINETY THREE PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS. WE ESTIMATE ARE CURRENTLY INSURED AND THIS MARKS AN INCREASE FROM ABOUT EIGHTY THREE PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN CHANGES THAT ARE LARGELY RELATED WE THINK TO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. I MEAN ACTUALLY FLIP AHEAD TO THE FIGURE ON PAGE TWO HERE. TO BREAK BRIEFLY DESCRIBE WHERE CALIFORNIANS OBTAIN THEIR COVERAGE SO JUMPING DOWN ACTUALLY TO THE BOTTOM. WE ESTIMATE THAT THE LARGEST PORTION OF CALIFORNIANS PROBABLY A LITTLE OVER FIFTEEN MILLION. INDIVIDUALS OBTAIN COVERAGE THROUGH THEIR EMPLOYERS OR THROUGH EMPLOYER SPONSORED INSURANCE. ANOTHER AN ADDITIONAL THIRTEEN TO FOURTEEN MILLION OBTAIN COVERAGE THROUGH MEDICAID OUT THE STATE'S MEDICAID PROGRAM FOR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS AND THEN FOUR TO FIVE MILLION OBTAIN COVERAGE THROUGH MEDICARE WHICH IS FOR THE ELDERLY AND. AND CERTAIN DISABLED POPULATIONS. FINALLY THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET. PROVIDES COVERAGE TO TWO TO THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS AND THEN WE LEFT AFTER SOME SMALLER INSURANCE PROGRAMS WITH A RESIDUAL UNINSURED POPULATION OF ABOUT THREE MILLION PEOPLE WHICH I WILL. GO INTO NEXT TO DESCRIBE A LITTLE FURTHER. SO THERE ABOUT THREE MILLION REMAINING UNINSURED AND WE WOULD DIVIDE THESE INDIVIDUALS AND TO. PROBABLY TWO CATEGORIES THE FIRST WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR LESS THAN TO MILLION OF THEIR REMAINING AND THEN SHARED ARE UNDOCUMENTED ENCOURAGE IMMIGRANTS THE MAJORITY OF WHOM ARE LOW INCOME. LOW INCOME SO THAT THEY WOULD. QUALIFY FOR MEDI CAL OR SUB FEDERAL HEALTH INSURANCE SUBSIDIES THROUGH COVERED CALIFORNIA IF THEY HAD DOCUMENTED IMMIGRATION STATUS. THE SECOND CATEGORY COMPRISING A LITTLE MORE THAN MILLION INDIVIDUALS ACROSS THE STATE. COMPRISES CITIZENS AND IMMIGRANTS WITH DOCUMENTED STATUS. AND WE ESTIMATE THAT ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THESE SHARON SUBSIDIES THROUGH COVERED CALIFORNIA. BUT THEY'VE ELECTED NOT TO ENROLL THE REMAINING THIRD OF THE REMAINING ANY CHAIRED OUR RESIDENTS THAT WE ESTIMATE HAVE INCOMES TOO HIGH TO QUALIFY FOR FEDERAL INSURANCE SUBSIDIES TO RECOVER CALIFORNIA. CLOSER INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE WHICH FOR A FAMILY FOR WOULD BE. ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. NEXT I'M GONNA TOUCH JOHN STATEWIDE HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES HERE STILL BONTA AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE THREE. WE ESTIMATE THAT THERE FOR THERE'S FOUR HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL HEALTHCARE SPENDING IN CALIFORNIA IN THE FISCAL YEAR TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND THIS IS FROM ALL PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SOURCES SO IT INCLUDES. I NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS ARE SOURCES THAT OUT TOUCH ON. HERE VERY SHORTLY. FOR ON BEEN TERMS OF PER CAPITA EXPENDITURES THIS COMES TO ABOUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PERSON. FIGURED CHIU HERE BREAKS DOWN THE EXPENDITURES BY PAYER OR PAYER TYPE AND AS WE CAN SEE EMPLOYER SPONSORED INSURANCE THAT COVERS THE MOST INDIVIDUALS AND IT WROTE WE THINK IT ACCOUNTS FOR MOST THIS. THE HIGHEST PROPORTION OF SPENDING. IN TERMS OF SPECS MANAGERS ACROSS THE STATE AT BETWEEN HUNDRED HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION ARE YEAH SOME AND MEDIAN ESTIMATE OF HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THE NEXT. LARGEST SOURCE OF. HEALTHCARE SPENDING IN THE STATE IS MEDI CAL AT. ABOUT A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS AND THEN MEDICARE AT ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. YOU HAVE ALSO SEE OTHER THAN. IN TERMS OF PREMIUMS THERE IS A PORTION THAT IS SOME FORM OF OUT OF POCKET EXPENDITURES AND THE BACK COMPRISES COPAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES THAT PEOPLE INDIVIDUALS PAY WHEN THEY VISIT THE DOCTOR. TURNING TO PAGE FIVE. WE ESTIMATE THAT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL HEALTHCARE SPENDING IN THE STATE COMES FROM PUBLIC AS OPPOSED TO PRIVATE SOURCES WITH THE MAJOR PROGRAMS MEDI CAL MEDICARE AND THE FEDERAL HEALTH INSURANCE SUBSIDIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH COVERED CALIFORNIA. REALLY COMPRISING THE BULK OF PUBLIC SPENDING. THERE IS ALSO AN INDIRECT FORM OF PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR. HEALTHCARE INSURANCE AND THAT IS THE TAX EXCLUSION OF EMPLOYER SPONSORED HEALTH INSURANCE FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS EXCLUDE. FROM INCOME TAXES INCOMES THAT EMPLOYEES RECEIVE IN THE FORM OF. INSURANCE BENEFITS AND WE ESTIMATE THIS BENEFIT TO BE WORTH BETWEEN FORTY AND FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS IN FOREGONE REVENUE. TO THE FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF WHICH. IS IN IS IN TERMS OF FOREGONE REVENUE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ALL TOLD FEDERAL SPENDING ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT THREE FOURTHS OF THE TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN. IN TOTAL PUBLIC SPENDING ON MEDICARE OUT FORM IT. FEDERAL SPENDING COMPRISE A LARGE PORTION MEDI CAL HOUGHTON YOU KNOW ALL OF MEDICARE THAT'S NOT INCLUDE THAT'S NOT INCURRED BY THE INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPANTS OF THE PROGRAM. AND AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL HEALTH INSURANCE SUBSIDIES TO COVER CALIFORNIA AND THEN THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THEY PROVIDE THE REMAINING FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS MEDI CAL BEING. I THINK SIGNIFICANTLY THE LARGEST SOURCE THEIR. AND THEN THE MAJOR PRIVATE SOURCES OF HEALTH CARE SPUR OF PRIVATE HEALTHCARE SPENDING IN THE STATE ARE EMPLOYER SPONSORED INSURANCE PREMIUMS INDIVIDUAL MARKET PREMIUMS NET OF ANY OF FEDERAL SUBSIDIES THAT INDIVIDUALS PAY. AND THE OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES WHICH WE ESTIMATE OF BETWEEN THIRTY FIVE OR TWENTY FIVE AND THIRTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN COSTS IN THE STATE A IN THE FORM OF COPAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES ANOTHER HEALTH CARE COSTS. NOT PAID BY INSURERS AND AND THIS THIS FIGURE EXCLUDES ANY PREMIUMS THAT INDIVIDUALS WOULD PAY. NOW I'M GONNA TURN AWAY FROM DESCRIBING HEALTH CARE COVERAGE IN EXPENDITURES UNDER OUR EXISTING SYSTEM AND TALK ABOUT OUR ANALYSIS OF A PUBLICLY FINANCED HEALTH CARE PROGRAM. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE L. ILIO ANALYZE THE COST OF A STATEWIDE PUBLICLY FINANCE HEALTHCARE PROGRAM THAT WOULD REPLACE THE EXISTING MULTI PAYER HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THEY WERE GENERALLY PROVIDE EXCLUSIVE FINANCING OF HEALTHCARE SERVICES ACROSS THE STATE AND WOULD NOT DIRECTLY OPERATE HOSPITALS WERE EMPLOYED THE WORK FIRST BUT INSTEAD PRIMARILY BE FOCUSED WITHOUT FOCUSED ON FINANCING THE HEALTHCARE SERVICES THAT ARE CURRENT. WE JUST NOTE SO WE'LL GO THROUGH OUR ESTIMATES BUT A PROGRAM STRUCTURED DIFFERENTLY THE ONE THAN THE ONE THAT WE ANALYZE AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN COULD COST TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS MORE OR TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS LESS THAN. THE ONE THAT WE ANALYZED IN ANALYZING THE DATA PROGRAM WE MADE UP. SAID OF MAJOR ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING THAT IT WOULD COVER NEARLY ALL CALIFORNIANS BY INCORPORATING THE EXISTING FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDING STREAMS REDIRECTING THOSE TO BE ABLE TO PAY FOR. A A SINGLE STATEWIDE PUBLICLY FINANCED PROGRAM SUCH AS MEDICARE AND MEDICAID WHICH PREVIOUS SPEAKERS DESCRIBED SOME OF THE CHALLENGES OF. AND WE ASSUME THAT THE SYSTEM WOULD BE A FEE FOR SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM WHERE INDIVIDUAL SERVICES THAT AND GOT US THE SERVICES THAT INDIVIDUALS. UTILIZE WOULD BE SEPARATELY PAID FOR ON THEIR OWN AND THAT THE SYSTEM WOULD PAY. PROVIDER RATES THAT ARE COMPARABLE TO WHAT MEDICARE PAYS WHICH ARE LITTLE ALONE WHAT WE THINK HIGHER THAN WHAT MEDI CAL PAYS IN FEE FOR SERVICE. BUT NOT NECESSARILY AS HIGH AS THE COMMERCIAL RATES THAT. PRIVATE INSURERS TEND TO PAY. WITH THE SYSTEM THAT WE ALSO THAT WE ANALYZED OUGHT WOULD OFFER A COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE OF BENEFITS INCLUDING CERTAIN BENEFITS THAT ARE NOT OFFERED THROUGH TRADITIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE PROJECT PRODUCTS IN THROUGH EMPLOYER SPONSORED INSURANCE FOR EXAMPLE. SUCH AS LONG TERM CARE BENEFITS DENTAL INVENTED VISION BENEFITS. AND THEN FINALLY WE ASSUME THAT THIS PROGRAM WOULD HAVE NO COST SHARING THAT BAD THERE'D BE NO CO PAYS OR DEDUCTIBLES FOR THE INDIVIDUALS ARE FOR INDIVIDUAL SERVICES THAT. THE STATE RESIDENTS UTILIZE. WE ESTIMATED THAT THIS COST WOULD. THIS PROGRAM WOULD COST ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS ON IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN TERMS BUT WE WOULD NOTE THAT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING THAT ESTIMATE. GIVEN THAT IT WOULD BE SUCH A A LARGE TRANSFORMATION AND HOW THE STATE DELIVERS HEALTHCARE SERVICES. WE SOON THE HEALTH CARE SERVICES A SUCH AS DOCTORS VISITS SERVICES THE HOSPITAL IN PHARMACEUTICALS. WOULD REALLY COMPRISE THE TO THE BULK OF SPENDING IN THE PROGRAM THAT ADMINISTRATIVE OUR STATE OPERATIONS SPENDING WHAT ACCOUNT FOR LESS THAN TEN PERCENT OF TOTAL PROGRAM EXPENDITURES. WE ALSO ASSUMED THAT THE TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL PUBLIC SPENDING COULD BEREDIRECTED TO FUND THE PROGRAM. AND JUST NOTE THAT THERE IS UNCERTAINTY AS WAS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED ON WHETHER IN FACT NOT WHETHER OR NOT THAT COULD BE THE CASE. THIS LEAVES ABOUT TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL STATE REVENUE THAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO FULLY FUND THE PROGRAM HOPE. I AND THIS REVENUE WOULD LIKELY HAVE TO BE REYES THROUGH THE STATE'S TAX SYSTEM. TO CONCLUDE MY PORTION. IF THE LA OWES REMARKS I'M GONNA TURN TO A SET OF PROPOSALS THAT DOUR REALLY POLICY APPROACHES THAT WE'VE BEEN ASKED BY THE COMMITTEE DISCUSS. TO EXTEND COVERAGE TO THE REMAINING AND THEN SHARED. THROUGH REALLY THE EXISTING HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. CERTAIN APPROACHES WOULD BE DESIGNED TO TARGET THIS FIRST GROUP ARE UNINSURED LOW INCOME DOT AND I UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS PA WHO WE ESTIMATE ARE ABOVE ABOUT ALMOST TWO THIRDS OF THE REMAINING ON AND SHARE. WE DEFINE AGAIN LOW INCOME AS THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE EARNING LESS THAN FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE THE CUT OFF FOR FEDERAL HEALTH INSURANCE SUBSIDIES TO COVERED CALIFORNIA. FIRST POLICY APPROACH WOULD BE OUT TO EXTEND FULL SCOPE MEDICAL COVERAGE FOR INCOME ELIGIBLE UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT ADULTS THAT IS IMMIGRANT ADULTS EARNING LESS THAN MY ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY PER A PERCENT GENERALLY OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. AND THIS TRANSLATES INTO ABOUT THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR. MORE AND PREVIOUSLY A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THE STATE ACTUALLY EXTENDED A FULL SCOPE MEDICAL COVERAGE TO CHILDREN UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT CHILDREN UP TO AGE NINETEEN. BUT ADULTS REMAIN ONLY ELIGIBLE FOR WHAT IS KNOWN AS RESTRICTED SCOPE MEDICAID OUR. IN WHICH MEDI CAL PAYS FOR THE EMERGENCY AND PREGNANCY RELATED SERVICES BUT IT WOULDN'T FUNDS NIGHT OF THE. THE PREVENTIVE VISITS ARE OTHER OTHER TYPES OF SERVICES THAT MEDI CAL COVERS. WE ESTIMATE WE ESTIMATE THAT THIS APPROACH COULD EXTEND COVERAGE TO ABOUT A MILLION ADDITIONAL UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS ACROSS THE STATE MOST OF WHOM ARE WE DO ESTIMATE ARE ALREADY ENROLLED IN RESTRICTED SCOPE MEDI CAL. THE SECOND APPROACH TO. TARGET. REMAINING UNINSURED UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. WOULD BE TO PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE IN DIVIDEND OF VISUAL MARKET HEALTH INSURANCE SUBSIDIES. FOR. INCOME I SAID OF INCOME ELIGIBLE UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS IF THIS WERE MODELED AFTER THE FEDERAL HEALTH INSURANCE SUBSIDIES FOR EXAMPLE THIS WOULD. THIS WOULD PROVIDE STATE FUNDED TAX CREDITS TO UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS EARNING BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT AND FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. AND WE ESTIMATE THAT THIS COULD HELP AN ESTIMATED THREE HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND UNINSURED UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS OBTAIN COVERAGE. ONE WAY TO MODEL IT WOULD BE TO THESE TAX CREDITS WOULD BE TO. MODEL THEM AFTER THE FEDERAL TAX CREDITS WHICH LIMIT PREMIUMS THAT INDIVIDUALS PAY TO A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THEIR INCOME. NEXT TO HER I'LL TURN TO. POLICY APPROACHES THAT COULD TARGET THE OTHER REMAINING UNINSURED SO PRIMARILY STATE REP CITIZENS AND AND IMMIGRANTS WITH DOCUMENTS STATUS. ONE APPROACH HERE WOULD BE TO OFFER STATE WRAPAROUND TAX CREDITS IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET UP FOR INDIVIDUALS. WITH IT WITH INCOMES THAT ARE TOO HIGH TO QUALIFY FOR MEDICAID ALSO ABOVE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT. THESE PROTESTS PROPOSAL SORT OF OR THE SET OF PROPOSALS COULD POTENTIALLY HELP AROUND ONE MILLION UNINSURED. CALIFORNIANS OBTAIN COVERAGE NOW THERE TO. COMPLEMENTARY BUT SEPARATE. SORT OF. APPROACHES UNDER THIS MORE GENERAL APPROACH ONE WOULD BE TO OFFER STATE FUNDED HEALTH INSURANCE SUBSIDIES FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ACTUALLY EARN MORE THAN THE CUT OFF FOR FEDERAL ELIGIBILITY SO. COULD BE STRUCTURED TO FOR EXAMPLE. PROVIDE STATE TAX CREDITS FOR INDIVIDUALS EARNING. BETWEEN FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT IN FIVE HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE. BUT COULD BE MODELED IN A SORT OF SIMILAR FASHION WHERE. THESE INDIVIDUALS. TAKE HOMES OR NOT SORT OF PREMIUM PAY. WOULD BE LIMITED TO A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF THEIR INCOME OR A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THEIR INCOME. THE STATE COULD ALSO. OFFER STATE SUBSIDIES THAT. ACTUALLY JUST COMPLEMENT THE FEDERAL SUBSIDIES FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL HEALTH INSURANCE SUBSIDIES AND WHAT THESE COULD DO IS THEY COULD LOWER THE PERCENTAGE OF INCOME THAT INDIVIDUALS PAY. FOR PREMIUMS ON THE INSURANCE ON THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE SOMEBODY WHO'S ON WHO EARNS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE LIMITED TO TEN PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME IN TERMS OF THE PREMIUMS THEY PAY. A STATE TAX CREDIT COULD FOR EXAMPLE LOWER LOWER THAT PERCENTAGE TO MAYBE EIGHT PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME. AND THEN I'LL FINALLY TOUCH ON A STATE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE STATE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WOULD DO CRIER RESIDENTS STATE RESIDENTS TO MAINTAIN HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE OR OTHERWISE PAY A PENALTY SIMILAR TO THE ACA'S INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. BUT WHICH WAS. RECENTLY THE PENALTY OF WHICH WAS RECENTLY SET TO ZERO IN THE MOST RECENT FEDERAL TAX BILL. BEGINNING IN TWENTY NINETEEN. THE BENEFIT OF A STATE TAX CREDIT IT WOULD COULD THAT COULD REPLACE THE EXPIRING FEDERAL MANDATE PENALTY WOULD BE THAT IT COULD. PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE FOR INDIVIDUALS ESPECIALLY THE RELATIVELY YOUNG AND HEALTHY A TO MAIN HATE MAINTAIN HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. TO GIVE SOME CONTEXT ON THE PENALTIES THAT WERE PAID BY CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS ARE. UNDER THE FEDERAL MANDATE. ALMOST EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS PAID THE FEDERAL INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AT A TOTAL PENALTY AMOUNT OF THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY PORTION. OF OUR REMARKS HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS BUT I'LL TURN OVER TO RYAN MILLER. AND RYAN MILLER FROM THE LA NOW. BEFORE WE DIVE INTO SOME OF THE. FRONT FINANCING OPTIONS THAT WE'VE PREPARED I WANTED TO HIT A COUPLE OF INTRODUCTORY POINTS. FIRST WHILE WHILE WE WALK THROUGH VARIOUS TAXES WE PROVIDED ESTIMATES OF WHAT RATES WOULD BE NECESSARY TO RAISE AN ADDITIONAL. TEN BILLION DOLLARS ON THE LOW END AND TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS ON THE HIGH END. AND WE WE PICKED THOSE NUMBERS BECAUSE THEY REPRESENT. MANY OF THE PROPOSALS BEING THROWN AROUND. SOME OF THE PROPOSALS THAT. MISTER JOHNSON DISCUSSED IN KIND OF THE SEVERAL BILLION DOLLAR RANGE AND MORE SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES TO THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN THE. TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR RANGE. AS MISTER GRAVES MENTIONED. TAX INCREASES GENERALLY REQUIRE A TWO THIRDS VOTE OF THE LEGISLATURE. HOWEVER IN SOME CASES. CHANGES WOULD REQUIRE GOING TO THE VOTERS I GENERALLY SPEAKING MODIFYING THE PROPERTY TAX FOR EXAMPLE. WOULD REQUIRE AMENDING THE CONSTITUTION AND A AND A STATEWIDE VOTE. AND I WANTED ALSO HAD ON. FEDERAL TAX CHANGES THAT WERE RECENTLY MADE. ITS IT THE THE THE THE FEDERAL BILL IS VERY COMPLEX THERE'S A LOT OF. PROVISIONS THAT WERE WORKING FOR A LOT OF THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD IS TAKING A LOOK AT THE EFFECTS. BUT ONE OF THE PROVISIONS THAT SEEMS. PARTICULARLY NOTABLE FOR THIS CONVERSATION IS THE. BUT IS THE CAP ON THE STATE AND LOCAL TAX DEDUCTIONS. I'M SURE THAT YOU'VE HEARD OF IT. I TAXPAYERS CAN DEDUCT UP TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OF EITHER PERSONAL INCOME TAX OR SALES TAX PLUS PROPERTY TAXES. SO WHERE AS LAST YEAR. MANY OF THE OPTIONS WILL DISCUSS. WOULD HAVE ALLOWED A TAXPAYERS TO DEDUCT THE INCREASE ON THEIR FEDERAL TAX BILLS. MANY TAXPAYERS. NO LONGER WOULD HAVE THAT OPTION. SO. FIRST WE'LL DISCUSS THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX THE PERSONAL INCOME TAXES THE MAIN STATE TAX. PROVIDES. ROUGHLY SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE STATE'S GENERAL FUND. IT'S LEVIED ON. HOUSEHOLD INCOME LIKE WAGES AND SALARIES RETIREMENT INCOME BUSINESS INCOME. I AND THE STATE ASSESSES. MARGINAL RATES THAT RANGE FROM ONE PERCENT TO TWELVE POINT THREE PERCENT. AND THEY INCREASE WITH INCREASES IN INCOME. AS WE KNOW THE HAND OUT THERE IS ALSO A ONE PERCENT SURCHARGE. FROM PROPOSITION SIXTY THREE RELATED TO MENTAL HEALTH. BUT WE GENERALLY DON'T I HAVE THOSE REFLECTED IN OUR. ESTIMATES AND TABLES HERE. SO THE TWO MAIN WAYS THAT YOU CAN INCREASE PERSONAL INCOME TAX REVENUE. ARE TO EITHER INCREASE RATES AND OR. ELIMINATE OR MODIFY TAX EXPENDITURES LIKE THE MORTGAGE INTEREST DEDUCTION. FOR THIS HAND OUT WE LOOKED AT WHAT TYPES OF RATE INCREASES WOULD BE NECESSARY. TO RAISE OTHER TENANT TO HONOR BILLION DOLLARS IN LOOK AND ASSUMING THAT. THERE WOULD BE AT ACROSS THE BOARD. INCREASE IN ALL RATES NOW. YOU KNOW YOU WOULD HAVE OPTIONS TO SORT OF CONCENTRATE THAT TAX INCREASE ON DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE INCOME DISTRIBUTION. BUT AGAIN WE WE KIND OF LOOKED AT A. AN ACROSS THE BOARD OPTION. SIR ALL KNOW THAT. THAT THE HANDOUTS THAT THEN THE COMMITTEE HAVE. ARE UPDATED TO REFLECT THE A PROBLEM THAT WE FOUND IN IN THEIR TABLE. EARLIER THIS MORNING BUT ANYBODY WHO HAD PICKED UP THE HAND OUT FROM OUTSIDE THE ROOM. CAN FIND THE CORRECTED VERSION ON OUR WEBSITE. SO WE ESTIMATE THAT IT THAT IT INCREASE REQUIRED FOR TEN BILLION DOLLARS WOULD REQUIRE A TEN PERCENT INCREASE IN RATES ACROSS THE BOARD SO FOR EXAMPLE. I THE TOP TWELVE POINT THREE PERCENT RATE WOULD HAVE TO INCREASE TO THIRTEEN POINT FIVE PERCENT. I DON'T IN ORDER TO RAISE TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS HOWEVER THE RATES WOULD HAVE TO BE ABOUT THREE TIMES HIGHER. I AM IS REFLECTED ON THE TABLE THE CORRECTED VERSION THAT IS. THE TOP MARGINAL RATE ON THE TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR OPTION WOULD BE. ABOUT THIRTY SIX PERCENT. AND TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT THERE. WHEN COMBINED WITH THE NEW TOP FEDERAL RATE. IN THE IN THE RECENT FEDERAL. BILL. THAT WOULD RESULT IN A COMBINED STATE AND FEDERAL RATED OVER SEVENTY PERCENT. THIS SEEMS LIKE A GOOD TIME TO MENTION. THAT SOME OF THESE OPTIONS WOULD WOULD HAVE LARGE TAXPAYER BEHAVIORAL RESPONSES IN IN FOR EXAMPLE HERE. ONE CAN IMAGINE THAT WITH. COMBINED RATE OF OVER SEVENTY PERCENT THERE WOULD LIKELY BE MANY PEOPLE. FINDING ANOTHER PLACE TO LIVE. AND AND I MENTION THAT AS WELL BECAUSE WE HAVE PRODUCED. STATIC ESTIMATES THE DON'T ASSUME. CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY CHANGES AND HOW TAXPAYERS RESPOND. AND SO PARTICULARLY AT THE HIGH END OF OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS PRESENTATION. THERE WOULD BE HUGE UNCERTAINTY. RESULTING FROM FROM THESE FACTORS. AND IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE THAT THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE THAT WOULD BE RAISED IF YOU DID UP PURSUE SOME OF THESE OPTIONS WOULD. WOULD. VERY FROM THESE ESTIMATES BY MANY TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. SO NEXT WILL DESCRIBE THE PROPERTY TAX AND IT'S THE MAIN LOCAL TAX SOURCE. THE. THE PROPOSITION THIRTEEN. MAILED A NUMBER OF CHANGES TO THE PROPERTY TAX IT CAPS THE. PROPERTY TAX RATE AT ONE PERCENT. AND ALSO. AFFECTS HOW. HOW ASSESSED VALUES CAN GROW? IT LIMITS. GROWTH NEXT BEEN ASSESSED VALUES TO THE GREATER INFLATION AND TWO PERCENT AND SO. THAT KIND OF USMOVES OUT THE TAX BASE. SO FOR OPTIONS FOR ATTACKS THAT THE PARTY TAX YOU CAN EITHER INCREASE THE TAX RATE OR YOU CAN MAKE CHANGES TO THAT ASSESSMENT SYSTEM FOR EXAMPLE SOME HAVE UP PROPOSED A SPLIT ROLE WHEREBY. A RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES ARE CONTINUING TO BE TAXED AT THE IN THE UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM THE COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES WILL BE TAXED AT MARKET VALUES. FOR THIS. HEARING HOWEVER WE LOOKED AT. JUST AN INCREASE IN TAX RATES WITHOUT A CHANGE IN THE TAX BASE OR IN THE ASSESSMENT SYSTEM. NOW WE ESTIMATED THAT A POINT TWO PERCENT INCREASE WOULD BE NEEDED FOR AN ADDITIONAL TEN BILLION DOLLARS WHICH WOULD BRING THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE. TAX RATE TO. I BELIEVE ONE POINT THREE PERCENT. BUT IT BUT A TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE ON THE OTHER HAND WOULD REQUIRE AN INCREASE OF THREE POINT SEVEN PERCENT WHICH WOULD BRING THE AVERAGE RATES ALMOST FIVE PERCENT. NEXT. IS THE SALES AND USE TAX. THIS IS ATAXES COLLECTED BY THE STATE AND IS DISTRIBUTED TO THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE RATE IS CURRENTLY EIGHT POINT FIVE PERCENT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN. CHOOSE TO ADD ON RATES. SO THAT TELLS TAX CAN VARY CONSIDERABLY IN SOME PARTS OF THE STATE. NOW IN THE SALES TAX. ANOTHER OPTION THAT YOU CAN CONSIDER IS TO CHANGE THE TAX BASE FOR EXAMPLE. SOME PEOPLE HAVE TALKED ABOUT EXTENDING THE SALES TAX SERVICES. WE ALSO NOTE. THAT. THAT THE SALES TAX COULD ALSO BE EXTENDED TO. BE APPLIED TO A CANDY SNACK FOODS AND BOTTLED WATER BUT THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER OPTION THAT REQUIRE GOING THE VOTERS BECAUSE THERE'S A SPECIFIC. PROVISION IN THE CONSTITUTION ABOUT THAT. SO WE AGAIN. MADE NO. ASSUME NO CHANGE IN THE TAX BASE. AND JUST LOOK AT WHAT KINDS OF RATES WOULD BE NEEDED TO RAISE THE ADDITIONAL AYE REVENUE. FOR TEN BILLION DOLLARS WE ESTIMATE THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT. AND THAT WOULD BRING THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE SALES TAX RATE TO ABOUT TEN PERCENT. THAT ON THE OTHER HAND. TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS WOULD REQUIRE AN INCREASE OF ROUGHLY TWENTY EIGHT PERCENTAGE POINTS. I WHICH WOULD BRING THE AVERAGE SALES TAX RATE TO ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT. ANOTHER OPTION. THAT WE INCLUDE IS IS A PAYROLL TAX ON THE STATE HAS A FEW SMALL PAYROLL TAXES FOR EXAMPLE THAT ARE LEVIED FOR. REALLY DONE EMPLOYMENT ASSURANCE. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALSO LEVEES PAYROLL TAXES FOR EXAMPLE FOR SOCIAL SECURITY AND THEY LOVE IT UP TO A CERTAIN AMOUNT. I BELIEVE IN. AND. TWENTY SEVENTEEN IT WAS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED. BUT THE STATE COULD CHOOSE TO APPLY IT TO ALL INCOME IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE A CAP. ON THE STATE WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE CHOICES ABOUT WHAT RATE TO CHARGE IN COULD CONCEIVABLY CHARGE DIFFERENT RATES. DIFFERENT INCOME LEVELS. WE ESTIMATED THAT AN INCREASE OF TEN BILLION DOLLARS WOULD REQUIRE PAYROLL TAX RATE OF ZERO POINT EIGHT PERCENT. AND THAT IS INCREASE OF TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS WOULD REQUIRE RATE OF ROUGHLY FIFTEEN PERCENT. FINALLY AN OPTION THAT WE INCLUDED. HAS BEEN MENTIONED BY. SOME RESEARCHERS. GROSS RECEIPTS TAX. A GROSS RECEIPTS TAXES A LITTLE BIT SIMILAR TO A SALES TAX ITS ITS ASSESSED ON ALL BUSINESS SALES ENDING AND INCLUDES GOODS AND SERVICES. BUT WHEREAS THE SALES TAX IS COLLECTED AT THE RETAIL LEVEL YOU KNOW LIKE AT A STORE. THE GROSS RECEIPTS TAX IS COLLECTED AT ALL STAGES OF PRODUCTION. AND SO YOU COULD IMAGINE FOR EXAMPLE. A CAR MANUFACTURER THAT IS. SOURCING SEAT BELTS AND BRAKE PADS AND ALL KINDS OF PARTS IN ASSEMBLING A CAR THERE THEIR SOURCING THESE PRODUCTS FROM OTHER COMPANIES. AT EACH STAGE OF THAT PROCESS WHEN THEY PREPARE THE SEAT BELTS AND OTHER PARTS THE GROSS RECEIPTS TAX WOULD BE ASSESSED EVERY SINGLE TIME. AND THIS CAUSES SOME. POTENTIALLY NEGATIVE ECONOMIC EFFECTS BECAUSE IT WOULD PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE FOR FIRMS. TO. STAR INSTEAD TO PRODUCE ALL OF THOSE MATERIALS THEMSELVES SO AS TO AVOID THE TAX NEXT PARTICULARLY A PROBLEM WITH A LARGER TAX RATE. WE ESTIMATED THAT A GROSS RECEIPTS TAX OF ZERO POINT TWO FIVE PERCENT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO RAISE THE TEN BILLION DOLLARS. BUT IN ORDER TO RAISE TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS WE ESTIMATED THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE ROUGHLY FIVE PERCENT. SO IN THE END OF THE. PRESENTATION HERE WE HAD ON A NUMBER OF. CONSIDERATIONS TWO WAY. AS YOU CONSIDER VARIOUS PROPOSALS. I'M NOT GOING TO COVER EVERYONE BUT I DID WANT TO MENTION. NEAR THE BOTTOM OF PAGE SEVENTEEN HERE. REVENUE VOLATILITY AND WHICH HAS BEEN A BIG HOT ISSUE IN THE STATE BUDGET FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS OR SO. AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW WITH THE GENERAL FUND OF THE GENERAL FUND RELYING SO MUCH IN THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX WHICH IS A HIGHLY VOLATILE SOURCE. HAS MADE BUDGETING CHALLENGING BECAUSE REVENUES CAN CAN KIND OF BOOM AND BUST. AND IN THE PAST. THE STATE HAS COMMITTED TO AN UNSUSTAINABLE LEVEL OF SPENDING AND THAT'S. PART OF THE REASON THAT THE STATE HAD. SUCH SIGNIFICANT BUDGET PROBLEMS IN THE TWO THOUSANDS. PROPOSITION TWO THAT WERE OF THAT WAS APPROVED BY VOTERS IN TWENTY FOURTEEN ESTABLISH A RAINY DAY FUND. WITH. WITH. WITH A TARGET OF TEN PERCENT OF GENERAL FUND TAXES. AND THE THE POINT OF THE RAINY DAY FUND WAS TO. ON THE ONE HAND KEEP SPENDING LOWER BECAUSE YOU'RE TAKING SOME OF WHAT COULD OTHERWISE BE SENT AND YOU'RE PUTTING IN THE RADIATOR FINE BUT ALSO HAVE RESOURCES AVAILABLE SO THAT WHEN. WHEN THERE'S AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN IN THE STATE BUDGET IS FACING BUDGET PROBLEMS YOU CAN DRAW ON THAT RAINY DAY FUND TO TO AVOID SPENDING CUTS AND TAX INCREASES AND OTHER ACTIONS. NOW IN THE CONTEXT OF. OF OTHER HEALTH CARE. AUGMENTATION. YOU. THE THE VARIOUS OPTIONS THAT WE MENTION HERE WOULD WOULD VARY CONSIDERABLY IN TERMS OF REVENUE VOLATILITY FOR EXAMPLE. A A PERSONAL INCOME TAX US ROUTE BY RATE INCREASE THAT'S FOLKS AND HIGH INCOME TAXPAYERS WOULD BE VERY VOLATILE. AND AND GENERALLY SPEAKING. ALL THINGS EQUAL WOULD REQUIRE A LARGER BUDGET RESERVE. THAN SAY PROBABLY A PAYROLL TAX WHICH IS LIKE WE DON WAGES AND SALARIES WHICH IS A RELATIVELY. STABLE I INCOME SOURCE. SO SO THOSE THOSE TWO. CONSIDERATIONS REALLY SHOULD BE THOUGHT OF TOGETHER TO THE TO IN GENERAL TO THE EXTENT THAT THE THAT A PROPOSAL RELIES ON A MORE VOLATILE REVENUE SOURCE. YOU HAVE A GREATER NEED FOR A BUDGET RESERVE AND THERE IS REALLY NO ONE RIGHT NUMBER. FOR WHAT IT TARGET SHOULD BE. AS THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S DISCUSSED. IN THE OVERVIEW OF THE BUDGET HEARING IT FROM THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE. TO SOME EXTENT IT RISE. RELY A LOT DEPENDS ON THE SORT OF RISK TOLERANCE YOU HAVE. BUT ESPECIALLY IN A PROGRAM OF. IT IF THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERS MAJOR CHANGES TO THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THIS YOU KNOW STABILITY AND PROVIDING SERVICES BOB IS DESIRABLE AND SO LARGER BUDGET RESERVE WILL HAVE THE LEGISLATURE REALIZE THAT. SO THAT CONCLUDES. MY REMARKS AND. WHERE MY HABIT ANSWER QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE THEM? THREE QUESTIONS MISCHIEF. I THINK IT'S CHAIR IT BRIGITTE. ALL THE PRESENTATIONS TODAY ARMED. THREE CATEGORIES OF QUESTIONS AROUND THE IMPACT OF TRUMP TAX PLAN. UP THROUGH THE COST OF SOME THE OPTIONS YOU LAID OUT AND THEN. SOME OF THE ESTIMATES YOU PAT AROUND A WATER PUBLICLY FINANCED SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM MIGHT LOOK LIKE SPEAKING FIRST AROUND THE IMPACT OF THE TRUMP TAX PLAN I. I APPRECIATE THE VARIOUS TAX OPTIONS THAT YOU HAVE LAID OUT HERE. UP OBVIOUSLY THESE WERE IN CONSIDERATION I THINK LAST YEAR WHEN. THIS WAS AND AND DISCUSSION IN THE SENATE. OF BUT SINCE THEN WE'VE OBVIOUSLY HAD A VERY SIGNIFICANT. FEDERAL. SAID OF CHANGES OF OUR TAX POLICY AND. YOU ALLUDED TO SOMEONE ELSE'S THAT YOU'RE STARTING ARE ON WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO BRING BACK SOME OF THE REVENUES BUT GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT CUTS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL OF CERTAIN. TAXES. IS THE LA O. ARE YOU GUYS ANALYZING WHAT IT MIGHT TAKE TO US FOR US TO REVERSE SOME OF THAT TO BRING IN STATE REVENUES. ARE IN A WAY THAT MIGHT BE TAX REVENUE NEUTRAL OR TAX MUTUAL TO. AT SOME OF THE CORPORATIONS OR THE WEALTHY YOUR. CALIFORNIANS THAT HAVE JUST SEEN SIGNIFICANT TAX CUTS AND WHAT DO THOSE NUMBERS LOOK LIKE. ENSURE WE HAVE NOT PRODUCED ANY ANALYSIS LIKE THAT. AS I MENTIONED THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD IS CURRENTLY WORKING THROUGH. THE MANY PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL TAX BILL ON AND SOME OF THEM ESPECIALLY ON THE BUSINESS TAX SIDE ARE QUITE COMPLICATED. FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A NEW LOVE A DEDUCTION OF. PASSED THROUGH INCOME FROM BUSINESSES TO INDIVIDUALS AND. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT'S GOING TO MEAN FOR THE STATE. SO. IT WE COULD OR IS HE LEN GONNA LOOK AT THIS HEARD IS THIS REALLY ENHANCE OF FOR THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AT THIS POINT. WELL I I BELIEVE FTP IS PLANNING TO PRESENTER A PORTS OF THE LEGISLATURE IN APRIL ABOUT CONFORMITY ISSUES. AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAS. NOTED THAT IT PLANS TO TRY TO REFLECT THE REVENUE IMPACTS IN ITS MAY REVISION. WE'LL OF COURSE SPEECH TRYING TO ESTIMATE THOSE AFFECTS AS PART OF OUR FUTURE WILL FUTURE I REVENUE ESTIMATING EFFORTS. BUT ULTIMATELY IT'S GOING TO BE AT LEAST ANOTHER YEAR BEFORE. WE START TO GET ANY DATA ON THE ONE HAND. ABOUT HOW MUCH I INCOME HAS BEEN SHIFTED FROM YEAR TO YEAR BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE INCENTIVES THAT TAXPAYERS SPACE. BUT MOREOVER IT'S UNDERSTAND KIND OF THE ONGOING AFFECTS IT'S REALLY GOING TO TAKE A FEW YEARS TO GET ENOUGH DATA TO HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF THAT. SO I GUESS IN SHORT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE. SOME OF THOSE A FAX. IN ORDER TO. TO LOOK AT. WHAT SORT OF? OFFSETTING MEASURES THE STATE COULD TAKE. AND I WOULD JUST SAY THIS IS FOR COLLEAGUES I'M CERTAINLY INTERESTED IN AND TRYING TO THINK ABOUT HOW OUR STATE COULD. REVERSE SOME OF WHAT I THINK OF AS THE. NOT NOT PARTICULAR HELPFUL POLICY DECISIONS MADE BY CONGRESS THAT HER GIVING SIGNIFICANT TAX BREAKS TO CORPORATIONS AND AND THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS. EN AND I'D BE VERY INTERESTED IN THINKING ABOUT WHAT TYPE OF TAX OPTIONS WOULD HELP TO. TO TO ADDRESS THAT WHEN YOU ARE SLASHING CORPORATE TAX RATE OR IMPACTING SALTS OR. OR INCREASING QUALIFIED BUSINESS INCOME OF THESE ALL SEEM TO ME BE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT AS A WAY TO POTENTIALLY FUND. NEW PROGRAMS THAT WE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER PARTICULAR IN THE AREA OF HEALTHCARE. FROM MY SECOND SET OF QUESTIONS I WAS. LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT. I THINK THAT THE MISTER. THE MISTER JOHNSON YOU WERE PRESENTED AROUND. HOW WE TARGET VARIOUS STE ON UNINSURED POPULATIONS AND I BOTH IN THE UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS? CATEGORY AS WELL AS WITH A LOT WITH WITH ON IT OTHER UNDER AND UNINSURED CALIFORNIANS DO ANY COST ESTIMATES ON WHAT THESE DIFFERENT OPTIONS WOULD. ENTAIL I'M THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE OFFICE IS WORKING ON AND IN TERMS OF THE. LET ME GO THROUGH THE INDIVIDUAL ITEMS THEN TERMS OF THE EXTENDING MEDICAL COVERAGE. FULL SCOPE. TO UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS WHO WOULD BE OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE BUT FOR THEIR UNDOCUMENTED STATUS WE DO THINK THAT THAT WOULD LIKELY COST IN THE LOW AND THE SEVERAL BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WE'RE STILL WORKING ON REFINING THOSE ESTIMATES BUT THOSE ARE SORT OF OUR PRELIMINARY. GENERAL NUMBERS IN TERMS OF PROVIDE EXTENDING INSURANCE TO UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS THROUGH SUCH A THING AS A. AS. HEALTH INSURANCE SUBSIDY PERHAPS TO COVERED CALIFORNIA OF THAT WAS POSSIBLE WELL WE HAVE SOME PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES THAT OF THAT AS WELL AND WE THINK THAT WOULD BE. IN THE LOW BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. BUT WE ARE NOT SURE SALES EVER BILLIONS VERSUS LOW BILLIONS SO SEVERAL BILLIONS ON THE MEDI CAL SIGNED FOR THE. FOR THE UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS WHO. WHO ARE REALLY BELOW ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL AND THEN FOR IN FRONT DOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS WHO ARE OVER ONE THIRTY EIGHT BUT? ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED. PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE THAT WOULD BE. THAT THE LOW BILLION TAKE AND I AND I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR SIZE. IN MY MIND SEVERAL BILLION LOW BILLION SOUNDS AROUND THE SAME. SINCE I WAS ABSOLUTELY HIGHER ESTIMATE ON THE MEDI CAL SIGNED IN ON THE THAN ON THE. COVER ART ON THE HEALTH INSURANCE SUBSIDY SIDE AND THEN HOW ABOUT TARGETING OTHER REMAINING ON A SHARED THOSE WE ARE LOOKING INTO BUT WE DO NOT HAVE ANY ESTIMATES THAT WE CAN CHAT THE SOCKET WHEN YOU EXPECT HAVE THAT'S. OR WE ARE GOING TO BE WORKING ON THEM OVER THE SPRING AND WE HOPE TO BE ABLE TO. PROVIDE LEGISLATURE WITH SOME TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON THOSE. AT THAT AT THAT POINT OKAY AND THEN MY MY LHASA QUESTIONS HAVE TO DO WITH SOME OF THE COMMENTS HE MADE AROUND WHAT A PUBLICLY FINANCES TIM WOULD WOULD COST AND. THERE'S BEEN A LOT THAT'S BEEN MADE OF THE FOUR HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR NUMBER AND. AS A READ ON PAGE EIGHT YOU ESTIMATE FOR HER BILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL COSTS TO RUN A PUBLICLY FINANCED HEALTH CARE PROGRAM. NOW WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME IS THAT AS. EXACTLY HOW MUCH WE USE HAVE SPENT IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. ARE ON HEALTH EXPENDITURES RIGHT SO THAT NUMBER IS NOT COINCIDENTAL IT'S IT'S MEANT TO BE THE SAME. OR DID YOU CALCULATE A DIFFERENT WE CALCULATED IT QUITE A BIT DIFFERENTLY. SO WE WE. WE CHECKED OUR NUMBER AGAINST EXISTING HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURES TO SEE IF IT WAS IN THE BALLPARK OR SOMETHING AROUND WHAT OUR EXPECTATIONS WOULD BE. HOWEVER OUR APPROACH WAS REALLY TO. LOOK AT HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES FROM THE MOST SORT OF ANALOGOUS PROGRAM THAT WE COULD THINK OF TO. THE ONE THAT WE'RE ANALYZING IN THIS WAS AND SO WE USED MEDI CAL AS A SORT OF BASE LEVEL. BASE LEVEL POGRAM BY WHICH WE COULD. TEND TO SEE WHAT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF ADDITIONAL PEOPLE ENROLLED IN MEDICAID OUT AND THE SORT OF COVERAGE. YOU KNOW THE POPULATION TIED THE TYPES OF POPULATIONS THAT WERE ENROLLED CHANGE THE RATES CHANGE FROM THE RATES THAT MEDI CAL PAY TO THE RATES THAT MEDICARE PAY. TO CHANGE THEM TO TO CHANGE THE ASSUMPTIONS TO A MORE. BROADER SET OF COVERED BENEFITS. AND SO ON AND SO WE REALLY CONSTRUCTED IT FROM THE GROUND UP USING SORT OF MEDI CAL PER CAPITA EXPENDITURES THAT COMES WITH ITS OWN CAVEATS WHICH I'M HAPPY TO GO INTO. AND THEN BUILT THAT ESTIMATE FROM THE GROUND UP BILL TO SEPARATE ESTIMATE IN TERMS OF WATER THE ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENDITURES OF OF MEDI CAL AS WELL AS OTHER SO AS MEDICARE AND OTHER SORT OF STATE ADMINISTERED. HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS AND SO. BY AND LARGE WE JUST ABOUT A WEEK CAME AT IT FROM A DIFFERENT DIRECTION BUT SETTLED ON A SIMILAR NUMBER TWO EXISTING HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES IN THE STATE. OKAY WELL THAT ON IT DO YOU HAVE MORE DATA ON AND IF THERE IS A WAY TO TAKE THAT FOUR HUNDRED BILLION AND SET UP A PUBLICLY FINANCED ESTIMATE OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE A LOT OF. CHALLENGES WITH THAT BUT IF THERE'S A WAY TO DO IT IT WOULD NOT COST US ANY MORE THAN WHAT WORK CURRENTLY SPENDING TODAY RIGHT. IT IS NOT A TO THE THAT ADDED REVENUE THAT IS NEEDED. IS NOT ON TOP OF THE ADDITIONAL HEALTHCARE SPENDING IN THE ECONOMY SO LARGELY WHAT IT WOULD BE. ENACTING SUCH A PUBLICLY FINANCED PROGRAM WOULD INVOLVED TRANSFERRING EXISTING PRIVATE HEALTHCARE SPENDING AYE INTO OF PUBLICLY FINANCED. STATE RUN SYSTEM CONSUMMATE SURE HAVE THEIR CLEAR AND THEN. THE OTHER THING I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE NUMBERS WERE THE SAME. AGAIN MAYBE COINCIDENTLY THE. IS. THERE DON'T SEEM TO BE ANY SAVINGS FROM WHAT ONE WOULD THINK WOULD BE THE. THEY STREAMLINED ADMINISTRATIVE. OF NATURE OF A PUBLICLY FINANCE SYSTEM RATHER THAN HAVING MULTIPLE. PAYERS. AND AND THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM OR THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WE HAVE TODAY IT WOULD JUST BE ONE PAIR. OF BUT THERE DON'T SEEM TO BE ANY SAVINGS FROM THAT DID YOU ASSUME THAT IN YOUR MOM ó WE ASSUMED. WE ASSUMED. OR WE CREATED SEPARATE SORT OF ESTIMATES OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF SUCH A PROGRAM AND I I THINK THIS WOULD BE. THAT ESTIMATE WOULD BE LESS THAN IN THE EXISTING MULTI PAYER SYSTEM UP FOR EXAMPLE TO THE TUNE. WHAT BECAUSE WE OFTEN HEAR THAT ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS? PARTS OF THE SYSTEM OR TWENTY TO THIRTY PERCENT BUT. WE'RE NOT SEEN THOSE SAVINGS UNRESTORED TO HEAR IT FOR OUR ESTIMATE WE ASSUME TOTAL ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENDITURES WOULD BE LESS THAN TEN PERCENT SO. WE DID I WE WE MODELED SOME SAVINGS ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE SIDE IF YOU INCLUDE THE SAVING SAY THAT. IN THE EXISTING HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT IS REALLY DISTRIBUTED ACROSS SAY THE STATE ADMINISTRATING. ADMINISTRATING ENTITIES SUCH AS AN MEDI CAL AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE OCCURRING. IN THAT COMMERCIAL HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS AND SO FORTH. SO IN OTHER WORDS SAY YOU'RE SEEN SOME ADMINISTRATIVE SAVINGS DUE TO THE STREAMLINING BUT YOU'RE ASSUMING THAT IN A PUBLIC FINANCE SYSTEM MORE PEOPLE WOULD BE COVERED. IS THAT HOW IT ALL BALANCES OUT MOVIE GET MORE INDIVIDUALS WOULD BE WOULD BE COVERED THERE BE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE SET OF BENEFITS. THAT ARE COVERED THROUGH THE INSURANCE SYSTEM AND THEN I I AN ADDITIONAL. AND THEN AND AND THAT LACK OF SAY ANY COST SHARING AS IS IN THE EXISTING HEALTH CARE SYSTEM RIGHT AYE IT'S A SORT OF TRANSFER FROM. THE COPAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES THAT WE PAY AS INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE UTILIZING THE SYSTEM AN INSTEAD WE WOULD NEED THAT FUNDING TO BE IN THE FORM OF TAX REVENUES WHICH HELPS TO. AYE WHICH INCREASES THE AMOUNT OF REVENUES THAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO FUND THE PROGRAM. OKAY SOME I LOVE TO SEE THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS. WHAT YOU USED TO GET TO THAT FORMER BILLION DOLLAR NUMBER IT'S IT IS AMAZINGLY COINCIDENTAL THAT IT IS SO EXACTLY WHAT WE SPEND TODAY SO? ON PAT AND I KNOW YOU'RE BASICALLY SENATE WAS COMPLETELY COINCIDENTAL BUT. JUST LOVE LOVE TO SEE THAT AND THEN A FINAL QUESTION I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF. BACK AND FORTH ABOUT THE ASSUMPTIONS OF WATER BUT. A PUBLICLY FINANCED HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WOULD WOULD COST AND THE SO CALLED POLLEN STUDY THAT WAS OUT THERE THAT SUGGESTS THAT. THESE NUMBERS ARE ARE TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS LAST YEAR ANY COMMENT ON. THAT PARTICULAR STUDY AND. ANY ANALYSIS OF HOW YOUR ASSUMPTIONS DIFFER FROM THAT STUDY. YEAH AND AND JUST IN THAT WE WE WE DID WORK WITH THAT DOCTOR POLLAND A LITTLE BIT AND AND COMING UP WITH OUR ESTIMATE AND WE'RE HAPPY TO SHARE MANY OF THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE ARE USING IN OUR ESTIMATE OF WHAT DOES. THIS PUBLICLY FINANCED HEALTH CARE PROGRAM WOULD COST AND THERE WERE A COUPLE SORT OF THINGS AND LATER WELL AREAS WHERE WE DIDN'T AGREE. ON THE SAY ON THE COST SIDE THE. PERRY ANALYSIS TO THE POLLEN ANALYSIS ASSUMED A SET OF SAVINGS AS A RESULT OF. DECREASED UTILIZATION OF SAY UNNECESSARY MA MEDICAL SERVICES OF REDUCED FRAUD AND SO FORTH THAT WE DIDN'T NECESSARILY. SEE AS BEING AS BEING A SORT OF NECESSARY OUTCOME FROM THE LEGISLATION THAT WE WERE ANALYZING SO THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US AND AND THE POLLEN ANALYSIS THERE IS ALSO A DIFFERENCE ON. THE REVENUES AVAILABLE SIDE. WHEREAS THE POLLEN ANALYSIS ASSUMES THAT THE STATE COULD USE OF THE AS THE TAX BENEFIT DUE TO THE EXCLUSION OF EMPLOYER SPONSORED INSURANCE TO FUND THE PROGRAM WE DIDN'T IDENTIFY AWAY THAT THE STATE COULD ACTUALLY. OBTAIN THAT FUNDING AND USE IT TO FUND THE PROGRAM AND SO THERE WERE DIFFERENCES BOTH ON THE TOTAL COST SIDE AND ON THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE FUNDING SIDE THAT NETTED OUT TO A DIFFERENCE. IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH ADDITIONAL FUNDING WE THOUGHT WOULD BE NEEDED. GREAT THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT AND AND AGAIN I'D LOVE TO SEE THE INFORMATION WHEN YOU HAVE IT. THANKS. UP THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE INFORMATION WELL IF THE LEGISLATURE DECIDED TO PUT A MEASURE BEFORE THE VOTERS IT IT COULD GO RELATIVELY QUICKLY I MEAN I KNOW YOU'RE AWARE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS. CAN SPEED UP THE PROCESS CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN WITHIN A MATTER OF MONTHS. IF IT WERE UP TO. ORGANIZATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE LEGISLATURE TO PUT A MEASURE ON THE BALLOT. THEN YOU'RE TALKING PROBABLY AT LEAST A YEAR SIGNATURE GATHERING. YOU KNOW GATHERING UP THE MONEY NOT OF IT IS CHEAP MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO GATHER SIGNATURES MILLIONS OF DOLLARS POTENTIAL DEFIED A BALLOT. A CAMPAIGN. SO I AT A MINIMUM A YEAR. YOU ALSO SAID IT. YOUR ANNOUNCES THAT IT PRIME MAKES MORE SENSE TO GO TO THE VOTERS RATHER THAN RELY ON THE LEGISLATURE TO APPROVE SOME OF THESE POTENTIAL CHANGES LIKE. THE UP TO PROP NINETY EIGHT OR THE GANG LIMIT. WITH THAT BIGGER PICTURE. WITH THE ORIGINAL POLICY GOALS OF THESE INITIATIVE SAY ABOUT THE APPROPRIATE ROLES OF VOTERS VERSUS. THE LEGISLATURE. SAY THAT CAN CAN YOU REPEAT THE LAST PART OF QUESTION. WHAT TO THE ORIGINAL POLICY GOALS OF THOSE INITIATIVES? SAY ABOUT THE APPROPRIATE ROLES OF FOR VOTERS VERSUS THE AND LEGISLATURE. WELL IT'S HARD IT THAT'S A TOUGH ONE TO ANSWER BECAUSE. WE HAVE A PROCESS IN CALIFORNIA THAT MAKES THE CONSTITUTION RELATIVELY EASY. TO AMEND SO ON THAT. WHEN THE VOTERS AMEND THE CONSTITUTION. THEY MAY THINK THAT THEY'RE VOTING FOR ON AN ISSUE FOR THE VERY LAST TIME. BUT OUR PROCESS BY DEFINITION. IS OPEN TO CHANGE AND YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE WOULD ARGUE PERHAPS WE SHOULD NOT BE LIVING WITH THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT THAT'S BASED ON. YOU KNOW. SPENDING WHEN I WAS BACK IN THAT JUNIOR HIGH OR SOMETHING SO YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING FORTY YEARS BACK IN TIME OR SELL DO WE REALLY WANT TO TIE OURSELVES UP IN KNOTS SO. I THINK THERE'S ALWAYS A PRESUMPTION THAT EITHER THE LEGISLATURE OR THE VOTERS THEMSELVES. CAN GO BACK TO THE BALLOT AND RE VISIT DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE IN PRIOR YEARS NONE OF THIS IS WRITTEN IN STONE. IT SIMPLY REQUIRES FIFTY PERCENT PLUS ONE TO AMEND OUR CONSTITUTION OUT WHICH IS WHY IT HAPPEN SO FREQUENTLY. IS IT BECAUSE THAT HELP FORGET THAT'S THAT'S OKAY VERY HOPEFUL SO HONORED FOR OUR FOLKS EMILIO. DO YOU HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF OF WHAT CURRENT EMPLOYER PAYMENTS FOR HEALTH INSURANCE ARE AS A. AS A PERCENTAGE OR FRACTIONAL PAYROLL. AS A. PERCENTAGE OF PAYROLL. WELL I SORT OF MEDIAN ESTIMATE OF EMPLOYER SPONSORED PREMIUM SO SHARE BOTH BY EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES IS. ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS. WE ESTIMATE TOTAL WAGES AND SALARIES IN THE STATE TO BE ABOUT ONE POINT THREE TRILLION DOLLARS SO IT'S ABOUT. TEN PERCENT OF. WAGES AND SALARIES THAT IS PAID ON. ENSURE EMPLOYER SPONSORED BENEFITS AS A WHOLE INDIA HERE YOU GREATLY SAID THAT. SOME OF THE EMPLOYER BENEFITS TAX BENEFITS FOR PROVIDING INSURANCE. THERE'S THERE'S NO WAY FOR US TO REALLY RECAPTURE THAT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I GUESS. WE DIDN'T IDENTIFY NECESSARILY AWAY TO BE A TO BE ABLE TO REALLY CAPTURE THAT. AS REVENUES TO BE ABLE TO FINANCE THE PROGRAM. IT'S IT POTENTIALLY DEPENDING ON AYE AYE MY COLLEAGUE RYAN MILLER COULD TOUCH AND MORE IT POTENTIALLY COULD BE SORT OF IMPLICIT AND. IN IN DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE FUND THE PROGRAM GOING FORWARD I'M I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TOUCH ON THE PAPER. THOSE TAXES. WELL IT'S CERTAINLY A CONSIDERATION BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED. WITH THE SALES TAX PROCLAIMS PROPERTY TAX. OVER THE NEW FEDERAL LAW HAS A TEN THOUSAND LIKE CAPS OF FOR MANY TAXPAYERS. THERE WOULDN'T BE SORT OF A FEDERAL OFFSET TO THE TAX INCREASE HERE. I BELIEVE HOWEVER THAT. EMPLOYER. PAYROLL TAX PAYMENTS. CONTINUE TO BE DEDUCTIBLE ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL HOWEVER AND SO IF IF THE LEGISLATURE PURSUED THAT OPTION. THERE WOULD BE A SOURCE OF FEDERAL TAX BENEFIT. BUT IN TERMS OF THE STATE BEING ABLE TO COLLECT LIKE REVENUE THAT IS. I AT REDUCED REVENUE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I THINK THAT'S WHAT MY COLLEAGUE WAS SAYING WHERE WE DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW THAT WOULD. THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COULD DECIDE TO BLOCK GRANTED BUT WE DIDN'T FEEL THAT THAT WAS AN ASSUMPTION THAT WE COULD MAKE IN ESTIMATING THE COST OF THE PROGRAM. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL THREE OF YOU REALLY APPRECIATE CRESCENTA. EXPERIMENTS. AT THIS POINT WE'D LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT. LIKE TO. ASK THAT YOU LIMIT YOUR COMMENTS TO TWO MINUTES PIECE AND. WE HAVE TWO MICROPHONES SET UP SO. PLEASE WHOEVER. I THINK YOU WERE I THINK YOUR FIRST OVER HERE. PLEASE. HI MY NAME IS KEITH MCALLEN I'M WITH PHYSICIANS FOR A NATIONAL HEALTH PROGRAM HEALTHY CALIFORNIA CAMPAIGN HEALTH CARE FOR ALL. I'M GONNA SAY THIS QUICKLY BECAUSE I HAVE TO GET MY DAUGHTER TO BASKETBALL PRACTICE ENOUGH I DON'T UP I'M GONNA NEED HEALTH CARE WHICH I CAN AFFORD. THE LAW PROFESSOR FROM MISSOURI. STATED. A COUPLE OF TIMES THAT THE DETAILS THAT NOBODY KNOWS BUT THEY LEARN QUICKLY WHEN THEY HAVE TO I KEPT WAITING THE WHOLE TIME FOR HER TALK TO GIVE THE DETAILS OF WHAT OF. PRECISELY WHAT THAT IS HERE'S WHAT SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT EMPLOYEE SPONSORED PROGRAMS THAT ARE SELF FUNDED HAVE NO RECOURSE IN THE COURTS WHEN RIGHT FULL BENEFITS ARE DENIED BY GATEKEEPERS SO SAID THE SUPREME COURT. SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN SOMEONE GOES INTO THE E. ARE THEY HAVE A LITTLE BITTY BRAIN BLEED THEY NEED AN MRI DENIED VIBES REFLEXIVELY. A THE PERSON THEN DIES. SO WHAT ARE THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO AT THAT POINT WHAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO IT THAT. IS THE COST OF THE MRI THAT WAS DENIED. SO REGARDING THAT POINT. THREE THINGS PLEASE. INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE GAMING THE SYSTEM DENY DENY DENY FOR DOLLARS. A. PLEASE KEEP THIS IN MIND WHEN THE EARNEST UNDERWRITERS STAND BEFORE YOU AND TELL YOU THAT THEY'RE A BEAUTIFUL PART OF THE COMMUNITY. THIS ALSO GOES BACK TO WHAT BILL CLINTON SAID IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WITH HIS GAFFE OF IT'S THE CRAZIEST THING. WE MAKE THE ASSUMPTION HERE THAT EVERYONE THAT HAS EMPLOYEE BASED INSURANCE IS DOING JUST FINE CAN WE WE CAN'T TOUCH THAT. IT'S NOT TRUE. IT ALSO GOES TO WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN SAID. YEAH BACK IN LOS ANGELES. THAT. WHAT IF THE ANTS ARE IS THAT WE CALIFORNIA HAVE TO GET IT THE FIGHT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO GET ANYTHING DONE SHE'S RIGHT SHE'S RIGHT SHE'S RIGHT? THANK YOU. OUR I'M HENRY ABRAMS I'M A PHYSICIAN. WITH PHYSICIANS FOR A NATIONAL HEALTH PROGRAM. A COUPLE POINTS AND ONE IS THAT THE WORD COVERAGE HAS BEEN USED A LOT BUT. BY I THINK THAT IT WAS ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARE WALDRON WHOM MADE THE POINT. THAT WE ARE REALLY TALKINGABOUT ACCESS AND I THINK THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT COVERAGE THAT IS NOT IN ANY WAY. A CLOSE TO THE INDIVIDUAL WHO'S COVERED RECEIVING. A TIMELY APPROPRIATE HIGH QUALITY IS COMPREHENSIVE AND AFFORDABLE CARE I THINK ALL OF THOSE THINGS NEED TO BE KEPT IN THE FOREFRONT. AND THEY'RE ALL INTERLINKED AND THAT'S WHY PHYSICIANS FOR A NATIONAL HEALTH PROGRAM ARE STRONG ADVOCATES FOR A SINGLE PAYER PROGRAM BECAUSE THAT IS THE POLICY. THAT LINKS THOSE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS WITHOUT WHICH WE DON'T REALLY. PRODUCE MEANINGFUL REFORM. THE SECOND THING IS THAT I THINK WHEN DOCTOR POLLAND HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY ON WEDNESDAY. ON MY HOPE THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WILL KEEP AN OPEN MIND. ABOUT. WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE SOME GAPS IN THE LA JOH ANALYSIS WHEN ONE ELIMINATES PROFIT SEEKING COMMERCIAL? INVESTOR OWNED HEALTH INSURANCE AND AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. AND CAPTURES THE MAXIMUM SAVINGS FROM COORDINATED. DASH SIMPLIFIED CARE MY I THINK THAT THE COST OF THE PROGRAM WILL COME DOWN A LOT FROM THE FOUR HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS. AND THE THIRD THING IS THAT I HOPE THE COMMITTEE BUT HASN'T GOTTEN LOST IN THE ENORMOUS WEEDS AND DETAILS THAT THEY'VE HEARD. THAT SEEM TO BE OBSTACLES. IN THE FOR GROUND. TO GETTING TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE BUT KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE PRIZE THE PRIZE IS UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. ONLY A PUBLICLY FINANCED PUBLICLY ADMINISTERED NONPROFIT HEALTH CARE PROGRAM. I CAN ACHIEVE THAT AND I I REALLY. FEAR THAT THE THE COMMITTEE WILL GET BOGGED DOWN. AND. SHE AS AN OBSTACLE. THAT WE HAVE A DYSFUNCTIONAL BROKEN HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND SO IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT WE HAVE A DYSFUNCTIONAL AND BROKEN LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM. THAT. PREVENTION US FROM GETTING ACCESS TO THE MONEY THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS CUSTODIAN FOR BUT IT'S OUR MONEY AND CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO CLAIM IT. THOUGH I'M JEFF CARTAGIA. ADVOCATES. OF. CAR. DOG FIGHT. OTHER REPRESENTATIONS TWO CHAIRMAN WOULD I WILL SAY. ABSTAINING IS NOT A NEUTRAL VOTE. BUT FOR A YEAR YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN PUSHING. AND WHERE IS SINGLE PAYER IT'S BEEN AROUND HERE A LONG TIME BEING ASKED OR WHICH. YOU PRESENTED EVERYTHING. DOESN'T HAVE TO DO WITH HOW IN THE WORLD KEN'S SINGLE PAYER. WORK. I HOPE WEDNESDAY'S WILL BE BETTER AND BE MORE ON POINT ABOUT HOW THE SINGLE PAYER BECAUSE OUR CURRENT MEDICAL SYSTEM. HE NOT DOING ITS JOB. I THINK YOU AYE I'M BRIAN STOMP OF FROM THE BOTTLE. CALIFORNIA I'M RETIRED SMALL BUSINESS. OWNER. I'VE ATTENDED THREE IF YOU'RE HEARINGS AND THE I THINK YOU'RE DOING A GOOD JOB ASSESSING THE THE NEED. FOR A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM. AND. THE COMPLEXITY OF GETTING THERE. SOME PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THIS IS A WAY TO PARK THIS THING GET NOTHING DONE. I'M COMING AROUND TO THE THOUGHT THAT. PERHAPS. YOU PEOPLE ARE. EXPOSING A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS AND SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS. AND ARE GIVING THIS. A FAIR HEARING BUT OF COURSE THE NEXT STEP IS TO GET OUT OUT THERE AND DO SOMETHING WITH IT. UNITED STATES IS SPENDING OVER SEVENTEEN PERCENT OF US GDP. ON HEALTH CARE AMOUNTING TO NINETY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A PERSON THAT'S OVER THREE TRILLION DOLLARS THAT WE SPEND ON. OTHER HEALTHCARE IN THIS COUNTRY. IF WE HAD THE FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR PER PERSON WITH A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM AND WE SAVED THE FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PERSON. WE WOULD HAVE A SAVED A MILLION AND A ONE I'M STORY. A ONE AND A QUARTER TRILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ONE A QUARTER TRILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. WE ONLY SPENT THREE AND A HALF PERCENT OF OUR GDP. ON DEFENSE. AND WE SPEND MORE THAN THE NEXT SEVEN COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD. ON DEFENSE SO THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM IN YOU. INDIVIDUALS ARE IN CALIFORNIA ARE DOING A VERY IMPORTANT A JOB. NOT ONLY IN REDUCING OUR OUTLANDISH HEALTH CARE COSTS. BUT IN PROVIDING A BETTER HEALTH. AND I HOPE BECAUSE THESE POSITIONS OF MENTION. I THAT YOU NEVER CONFUSE INSURANCE. WITH HEALTH CARE INSURANCE IS NOT HEALTH CARE INSURANCE IS A WAY TO MAKE MONEY. IT'S A GOOD WAY TO MAKE MONEY IF A PERSON CAN'T AFFORD THE RISK THE NEED INSURANCE. CALIFORNIA CAN AFFORD THE RISK. THANK YOU AND I HOPE THAT. WERE SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING SINGLE PAYER. MONDALE FOUNTAIN WITH ENACT UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE FOR CALIFORNIA. THANKS AGAIN FOR THESE HEARINGS. AND I'VE FIRST OFF I JUST WANT TO CONGRATULATE THE ASSEMBLY ON PASSING THE WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS I'M BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT I SAW ON THE FLOOR. NEVIS ALMOST UNANIMOUS. IT WAS. I THINK THAT'S AMAZING WHEN EVERYBODY CAN COME TOGETHER. TO. TO PASADENA PROTECTS PEOPLE. LIKE THE WAY YOU GUYS DID. I THINK THAT'S KIND OF ANALOGOUS TO WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE. ALSO. ALTHOUGH SHE ISN'T IN THE ROOM. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN. SHE'S HELPED OUT A LOT AND I KNOW THAT. SHE PUSHED. TO GET THE CONSTITUTIONAL. ISSUES OF RAISED. AND. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULDN'T AND WELL DOCTOR RANDALL IS NOT HERE RIGHT NOW. BUT. THANKS ALL OF YOU AND I WILL SEE YOU ON WEDNESDAY. HELLO CRISCO IN FROM THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER WE ARE A STATEWIDE IMMIGRANT RIGHTS ORGANIZATION THAT ADVANCES AND SUPPORTS AYE IMMIGRATION HEALTH POLICIES. JUST WANTED TO THANK THE COMMITTEE ARE FOR HOLDING THAT TODAY'S HEARING ON IMPLEMENTATION OF CHALLENGES AS IT RELATES TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE OUR CONSIDERATIONS. AND JUST WANTED TO REITERATE THE IMPORTANCE OF SOME OF OUR WHAT THE LA A DISCUSSES IT RELATES TO THE. COVERING THE UNINSURED POPULATION I'M I KNOW MY COLLEAGUE WILL SPEAK MORE TO THIS AYE ON WEDNESDAY BUT JUST WANT TO REITERATE. SOME OF THE ONE OF THE POINTS THAT FIFTY PERCENT OF THOSE WHO REMAIN ON THE SHIRT IN THE STATE ARE UNDOCUMENTED AND SO. WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO. SPEAKING ABOUT WAYS IN AND ONE OF THEM BEING THE HEALTH FOR OUR PROPOSAL. THAT WOULD EXPAND ACCESS TO FULL SCOPE MEDICAL TO THE UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION IN DISCUSSING HOW THAT CAN BE ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH WE LOWER THE UNINSURED RATE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HAVE THEIR EYES STEPHANIE BERGER PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH UNDERWRITERS ARE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED MEMBERS ARE EXTREMELY PROUD OF THE WORK AS LEADING IN ROLLERS IN COVERED CALIFORNIA. COUPLED WITH THEIR ENROLLMENTS IN MEDICARE MEDICAL AND OTHER PROGRAMS OUR MEMBERS ARE ENSURING CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO LEAD WITH THE MOST SUCCESSFUL EXCHANGE IN THE NATION. WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT MORE HARD WORK AHEAD OF US. WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO PARTNERING WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THAT THE REMAINING SIX POINT EIGHT PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN SHIRT ACHIEVE THE RIGHT TO CHOICE AND QUALITY HEALTHCARE. THINK YOU. GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR NUMBERS TAM LA WITH HEALTHAXIS CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THANK YOU FOR HOLDING AND THIS HEARING TODAY AND IT. OF THEM WONDERFUL PRESENTERS HAVE GIVEN US A LOT OF OF REALLY GOOD INFORMATION AND FOOD FOR THOUGHT ABOUT LOVE THE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES THAT. THIS LEGISLATURE. AND POLICY MAKERS NEED TO GRAPPLE WITH AS WE LOOK FOR A PATH TOWARD A UNIVERSAL COVERAGE AND PARTICULARLY THE OF THE FEDERAL HURDLES THAT EXISTS WITH. BOTH LIKE FEDERAL FINANCING AND FEDERAL LAWS AND WAIVERS. I THINK. IT'LL LAST WEEK ON THE THIRTY FIRST UNCOVERED CALIFORNIA CLOSED ITS OPEN WORLD AND OPEN A ROAD PERIOD AND WE SAW A LOT MORE PEOPLE SIGNED UP FOR COVERAGE. AND WHAT THIS IS REALLY GREAT NEWS. PARTICULARLY. GIVEN ALL OF THE CONFUSION THAT HAS BEEN SOWED OVER THE LAST YEAR AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL ABOUT THE. OF AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND IT'S A VERY EXISTENCE. WE AT HEALTH ACCESS HAVE A LOT OF IDEAS ON HOW CALIFORNIA CAN'T GET UNIVERSAL COVERAGE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO SHARING THOSE WITH THE COMMITTEE ON WEDNESDAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AYMERIC LEAN XIN ON THE CO DIRECTOROF THE BUSINESS ALLIANCE FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA A BUSINESS ORGANIZATION OF THREE HUNDRED MEMBERS AND GROWING. THAT SUPPORTS THE SINGLE PAYER SOLUTION. WHAT STRIKES ME IS THE FACT THAT? WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE MONEY ALREADY BEING IN THE SYSTEM YOU FORGETTING IT OBEYED ABOUT WHICH THE COSTS AND SINGLE PAYER LET'S JUST SAY YOU HAVE FOUR HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS HERE YOUR FOUR HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS THERE WITH A MUCH BETTER SYSTEM. IN PLACE THE MONEY'S THERE SO WE SHOULD BE CREATIVE ENOUGH TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET IT INTO THE RIGHT PLACE. FOR ME AS A BUSINESS PERSON. HEALTHCARE HEALTH INSURANCE IS TAX OKAY WE EVER THINK ABOUT THAT ASPECT I KNOW SEMANTICALLY AND IN WEBSTER'S DICTIONARY IT WON'T BE THAT WAY. BUT IN REALITY WHAT COMES OUT OF MY POCKET TO PAY FOR EMPLOYEES IS A TAX. I SAME TIME NOT ONLY GOT TO SPEND THE MONEY BUT I HAVE TO SPEND ALL THE TIME WORRYING ABOUT GETTING IT FOR MY EMPLOYEES. IT SEEMS LIKE WE REALLY NEED A SIMPLIFICATION IN THE SYSTEM AND BY THE WAY I THINK WE ALL SAW THE HEADLINES LAST WEEK ABOUT THE NEW FORMATION OF A COMPANY. A NONPROFIT COMPANY. BY JEFF BEZOS WARREN BUFFETT AND JAMIE DIMON. BECAUSE OF THE FRUSTRATION LEVEL WITH OUR SYSTEM THAT'S BROKEN. I THINK BUSINESS WILL COME AROUND UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO PAY SOMETHING FOR HEALTH CARE WHETHER IT'S A PAYROLL TAX WORK OR HEALTH INSURANCE. WE GOT A LOOK AT WHAT'S REASONABLE AND WHAT WAS GONNA REALLY COST. WHO'S GOING TO BENEFIT AND THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE. BECAUSE I BELIEVE UNDER SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM WILL BEER CONTAIN COSTS A LOT BETTER THEIR SKYROCKETING LOOK AT PROBLEM WE'RE HAVING WITH PENSION FUNDS NOW. PART BECAUSE OF RISING HEALTH INSURANCE COSTS THANK YOU. I MY NAME IS DON BACKROOM FROM SINGLE PAYER NOW. LA I QUESTION THE LA OWES ASSUMPTION OF TEN PERCENT OVERHEAD TO RUN THE SYSTEM. MEDICARE DOESN'T NATIONALLY FOR TWO TO THREE PERCENT MEDICAID DOESN'T FOR FIVE PERCENT THAT'S BECAUSE THEY DO MEANS TESTING. OR THEY HAVE TO HIRE SOME SOCIAL WORKERS TO LOOK AT YOUR BANK ACCOUNTS NOW ME HOME JONES. SO I QUESTION THAT ASSUMPTION A WHOLE LOT. BOMB TODAY'S DISCUSSION. WAS ABOUT HOW TO GET MEDICARE MONEY INTO THE SYSTEM. WAIVERS IS NOT THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT. NOT JUST MENTAL NEW IDEA WE HAD THIS IN THE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR INITIATIVE IN CALIFORNIA. WHERE DOCTORS COULD SEND THEIR MEDICARE BILLS TO? TO THE COMMISSIONER. ALL THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE SYSTEM OR WHATEVER GOVERNING BUT WE HAVE IT. AND THEN THEY WOULD BUNDLES UP. AND BILL THEM DO THAT THE FUNCTION OF BILLING THEM TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THAT WAS FEVER SERVICE HAD THE FEVER SERVICE IN BELUM ONE BY ONE BUT THEY WOULD BILL THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. FOR EVERY OPERATION THAT YOU'RE A PROCEDURE THAT A DOCTOR HOSPITAL VISITS ANOTHER WAY OF GETTING THE MEDICARE MONEY INTO THE SYSTEM. I ALSO FOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING THAT THE KANSAS PROFESSOR. THAT'S A LOT OF TIME ONE MINUTE. I ALSO WAS VERY ANDERSON SHE SAID THAT FIFTY TO SIXTY TO SEVENTY PERCENT. OF BUSINESSES. ARM. MAYBE ARE INVOLVED WITH THEORISTS OF THING. THAT MEANS THAT WE PASSED A TAX IN THE STATE FOR HEALTH CARE. THEY COULDN'T CLAIM WE WERE TARGETING ANY ONE OF THEM. THAT MUCH BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA WHO PROVIDES HEALTH CARE IS. ARM. WHAT WE'RE NOT TARGETING AND WE'RE JUST IT'S AND OVERALL TAX FOR EVERYTHING THAT WE DO FOR? EVERYTHING IN THE STATE THANK YOU. HI FOLKS I'M PAUL ROCKED AB I'M. LONG TERM NURSE PRACTITIONER INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA ALSO MEMBER OF P. IN HP. AND I WANT TO REMIND ALL OF YOU IN TERMS OF COMMITMENT VALUE HERE. THAT IN THE EIGHT MONTHS THAT SENATE BILL FIVE SIXTY TWO HAS NOT HAD ANY ACTION OR BEEN FILLED IN IN ANY WAY. THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE DIED. AS A RESULT OF NO ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO AFFORD INSURANCE. AND LOOKING AT THIS IN TERMS OF THE UNINSURED. SIGNIFICANTLY UNDER ESTIMATES THE CONSEQUENCES TO PEOPLE IN TERMS OF MORBIDITY. THE UNDER INSURED AND THIS STATE OF SOMETHING THAT I CAN'T EVEN FIND ON THE INTERNET. THE NUMBERS OF THOSE PEOPLE THERE ARE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE BEING AFFECTED. BY THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THE COMMITMENT HERE HAS TO BE A FIGHT AWAY. SO I HAVE A COMMITMENT TO FIND A WAY. THROUGH THE COMPLICATIONS THAT WE'RE HEARING ABOUT TODAY IN TERMS OF FINANCING AND IT'S THEIR. THANK YOU. VERY MUCH. ANYONE ELSE. SEEING NO ONE WORLD GO AHEAD.
