I FIRST LIKE TO OFFER AMENDMENTS TO ADD SOMETHING MEMBERS FRIEDMAN AND SYRIAN AND SENATOR RUBIO. AS CO AUTHORS AND I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR THEIR PARTNERSHIP. I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR DILIGENT ANALYSIS OF A B. THREE. THIS BILL AIMS TO CURB ILLEGAL STREET RACING. BY STOPPING IT AT ITS SOURCE. THE MOTOR VEHICLE EXHIBITION OF SPEED. THE EXHIBITION SPEED IS MOST COMMONLY RECOGNIZED AS SITE SHOWS. THAT INCLUDED DRIFTING PERFORMING STUNTS DOUGHNUTS OR OTHER ACTIVITIES. DONE AT DANGEROUS SPEEDS TO SHOW OFF TO A CROWD IN OUR STREETS AND INTERSECTIONS. AS A COVERT NINETEEN SHUT DOWNS CLEAR THE STREETS. CALIFORNIA HAS SEEN A STAGGERINGSPIKE THIS RECKLESS ACTIVITY. LEADING TO DEVASTATINGRACKS AND SENSELESS DEATHS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. LAST YEAR ALONE. THE CHP RESPONDED TO OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND CALLS INVOLVING THE EXHIBITION OF SPEED AND STREET RACING. REPORTER AND REPORTED. A NEARLY EXHIBITION SPEED CITATIONS OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS. BUT SADLY. NOT ALL EXHIBITION IS BE CASES IN WHICH A PATIENT'S. SALAD NEARLY 47% OF. THESE CRASHES RESULT IN INJURY. 42% RESULT IN PROPERTY DAMAGE. 11% RESULT IN DEATH. IT'S BEHAVIOR ARE. CLAIMS INNOCENT. INPUTS CAN BE. BIKERS PEDESTRIANS AND LAW FORCE AT FATAL RISK. I'M SURE WE ALL KNOW OF TRAGIC CRASHES IN SITUATIONS IN OUR OWN DISTRICTS AND NEIGHBORHOODS. THE STARTLING REALITY IS THAT. WE FIND. THE TRAGIC STREET RACING STORIES IN THE NEWSPAPER. EVERY SINGLE DAY OF THE WEEK. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE CRASHES ARE PREVENTABLE. I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT EIGHTY THREE DOES NOT CREATE A NEW CRIME. BUT RATHER BRINGS PARITY TO EXISTING RECKLESS DRIVING CRIMESAND GRANTS THE COURT THE DISCRETION. TO TAKE ACTION ON SPEED EXHIBITION AND SUCH AS BEFORE THEY RESULT IN DEVASTATION. REFORMING RECKLESS SPEED STANDS AND STREET RACES ARE EQUALLY DANGEROUS CRIMES IMPOSED AN EQUAL RISK TO OUR ROADS AND COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER HOWEVER ONLY A CONVICTION FOR THE LATTER CAN RESULT IN A SUSPENDED LICENSE. AB THREE CLOSES THAT LOOPHOLE. AB THREE HAS RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT TO THE ASSEMBLY. HAS SUPPORTED BY MOTHERS AGAINST DRUNK DRIVING STATEWIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND VICTIMS RIGHTS GROUPS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. BUT THAT WOULD BE TODAY IS THERE CANDLER CENTER FOR. WHO FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE DEVASTATING IMPACTS OF ILLEGAL STREET RACING ACTIVITY BACK HOME IN BAKERSFIELD. I URGE I BUILT THANK YOU SIMPLY MEMBER FARM WE APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION AND NOW WE WILL GO TO YOUR PRIMARY WITNESS AND SUPPORT SARAH CANDLER- YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES SO YOU CAN GO RIGHT AHEAD AND SHE'S HERE IN THE GALLERY. THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS DEREK TAYLOR AND I'M FROM BAKERSFIELD CALIFORNIA. IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN I WOULD SEE THE MOST TERRIFYING INCONSEQUENTIAL PHONE CALL THAT CHANGED MY FAMILY'S LIFE FOREVER. MY MOM HE CAN THEY WERE STRUCK BY A DRIVER THAT LOST CONTROL OF THEIR VEHICLE DURING AN ILLEGAL STREET RACE. THIS TERRIFYING CALL QUICKLY TURNED DEVASTATING WHEN MY MOM LOST HER LIFE SHORTLY AFTER. HER AT THE SCENE. I COULD HAVE NEVER PREPARED MYSELF FOR THE OVERWHELMING GRIEF. THIS CRASH THAT BROUGHT MY FAMILY. THE CRASHING WAS HORROR. I WILL NEVER FORGET THINGS OF. HOW MUCH DAMAGE STREET RACING INSIDE SHOWS CAN CAUSE MY MOM'S CAR WAS MANGLED AND THE DAMAGE WAS SO SIGNIFICANT THAT THE FIRST RESPONDERS HOW TO USE THE JAWS OF LIFE. COULD OPEN TO BE ABLE TO REACH MY MOM. MY MOM IS THE ONLY PERSON IN IRAQ THAT LOST HER LIFE THAT DAY. BUT THEY TRY TO DO THIS SENSELESS PROCESS COULD HAVE GONE SO MUCH FURTHER. NOT ONLY DID THE VEHICLES RACING HAVE SEVERAL PEOPLE IN THE CAR BUT MY MOM WAS HIT ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON ON A MAIN STREET IN BAKERSFIELD RIGHT OUTSIDE OF THE BUSY MALL. AND CLOSE WALK TO A POPULAR PARK IN CHURCH. INDIVIDUALS PARTICIPATING IN SIDESHOWS AND STREET RACING DO OT THINK ABOUT THE DEVASTATION THEIR ACTIONS CAN BRAIN. INJURY THING- PERFORMING SENSE AT SUCH HIGH SPEEDS IT BECOMES NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO STOP. YOUR CAR WHEN YOU LOSE CONTROL. DESPITE COUNTLESS HEADLINES DURING.-LIKE MINE THE BIGGER SO POLICE DEPARTMENT REPORTED OVER SIX THOUSAND CALLS INVOLVING. EXPEDITION OF SPEED AND STREET RACING LAST YEAR ALONE. FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME LIVING NIGHTMARE MY FAMILY FELT EVERY SINGLE DAY. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE CRASHES IT HAS DEVASTATING IMPACTS ON VICTIMS FAMILIES. AND EVERY SINGLE STREET RACING CRASH IS PREVENTABLE AB THREE PROVIDES LAWS. LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH AN ADDITIONAL TOOL TO PREVENT THESE TRAGEDIES BEFORE THEY HAPPEN.

UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WILL DO ANYTHING TO CARTER'S. APPREHENSION CALL. IT LAW PROVIDES SERIOUS PENALTY FOR THE WHO ENGAGE IN THAT. OF SPEED AS PART OF THIS FIGHT OR OR OTHER LINES. LAWMAKERS VEHICLE EXHIBITION OF SPEED. PUNISHABLE BY TERM OF TO NINETY DAYS A FINE OF UP TO FIVE HUNDRED OR BOTH WITH HIGHER THAT THEY- WHEN THE INTERNET RESULT IN OR- DAMAGE IT IS WE OFFER.

NO INFORMATION BUT THE LACK OF THREE ON THAT AT THE TIED. BOB AND PAUL I'M VERY WELL. YEAH THE CARD UNTIL AWAY THAT'S WHY WE ARE COMMITTED MA'AM IF WE HAVE YOUR AT YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION AND THIS IS THE LAW THIS THE TIME WE'RE TAKING OPPOSITE TO A. THREE ALL I KNOW. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR AND LAST- MODERATE IS THERE ANYONE ELSE THE GIVEN UP. TO AB THREE. THERE'S NO ONE ELSE IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. OKAY THANK YOU SO WE'VE COMPLETED SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION WILL TAKE IT BACK TO MEMBERS FOR ANY QUESTIONS I SEE SENATOR RUBIO FIRST. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I DO STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND ALSO AS A CO AUTHOR TO THIS BILL. YOU KNOW I WANT TO BE- EXTREMELY SENSITIVE TO THE CONCERNS OF THE ACLU ODD THEY'RE RIPPED THEIR BALLOT. YOU KNOW ALL OF US HERE WANT TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO HELP OUR YOUTH ESPECIALLY AFTER. ON GETTING INTO TROUBLE MOVE ON WITH THEIR LIVES IT DIDN'T DO WHAT WE CAN. TO HELP FIX THEIR SITUATION. BUT WHEN I OF. THE YOUNG LADY THAT JUST TESTIFIED ABOUT LOSING HER MOTHER. THE FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS ARE NOT ABLE TO MOVE ON SO I ALSO HAVE TO BE MINDFUL OF THE VICTIMS THAT ARE LEFT BEHIND. YOU KNOW WHAT THESE TRAGIC ACCIDENTS NOT ONLY IS. YOU KNOW I SHE STATED YOU KNOW HER HER PERSONALLY MEDIA FAMILY LEFT DEALING WITH SUCH TRAGEDY BUT EXTENDED FAMILY SO MANY FAMILIES ARE IMPACTED BY. BY THESE TYPES OF ACCIDENTS AND AGAIN AND EVEN THOUGHI DO UNDERSTAND AND HAVE SENSITIVITY TO THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERN I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO PUT IN PLACE. AND ENSURE THAT IT LEAVES THE VICTIMS CAN FEEL CONFIDENT THAT WE ARE ALSO LOOKING OUT FOR THEIR LIVES AND THEIR- THEIR CIRCUMSTANCE AND WITH THAT I ASKED FOR AND I WILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO SENATOR WHAT HOUSEKEEPING MANAGER I'D LIKE TO ASK THE AUTHOR WHO IS GOING TO BE INCLUDED IN ALLOWING FOR SUSPENSIONS WHEN SOMEBODY'S CAUGHT IN A SPEECH CONTEST ASSIST STAFF REPORT POINTS. OUT AND AS THE OPPOSITION IS SAID. THE EXHIBITION SPEED IS THE LESS AND OFFENSE OR ALLOW OFFENSE. SO WHEN THESE PEOPLE ARE CHARGED IN BAKERSFIELD OR LOS ANGELES OR SAN JOSE THEY'RE CHARGED WITH SPEECH CONTEST. AN EXHIBITION OF SPEED DOWN. I CAN SEE SOMEBODY SAYING WELL I WAS A CONTEST BECAUSE IT THIS THIS THIS CLEVER LAWYER BUT THEY CAN STILL BE VIOLATING THE EXHIBITION SPEED WHICH INCLUDES THE NINETY DAY. LICENSE SUSPENSION SO HOW DOES IT WORK THE OTHER WAY MADAM CHAIR HOW CAN YOU. BE IN A SPEECH CONTEST BUT NOT. EXHIBITING SPEED IN YOUR IN THE VEHICLE HOW WOULD YOU HELP WORSE AT COLE PORTER PEOPLE THAT WE'RE GOING TO CATCH. THE AUTHOR COULD ADDRESS THAT. SURE THANK YOU SENATOR AKOWSKI AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER PHONE DO YOU WANT TO DRESS THAT NOW OR IN YOUR CLOTHES. I CAN I CAN DO EITHER WAY WHATEVER WHATEVER THE RIGHT ANSWER I WOULD SAY THAT THAT. THAT HOW THE EXHIBITION IS SPEED IS DEFINED AS A PERSON ENGAGING AND EXHIBITIONS B. WHERE HE OR SHE XCELERATED DRIVES AT A RATE OF SPEED THAT IS DANGEROUS AND UNSAFE IN ORDER TO SHOW OFF. OR MAKE AN IMPRESSION ON SOMEONE ELSE THAT IS DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT FROM MY SPEECH CONTEST WE ARE RACING AGAINST THE CLOCK. OR I GUESS ANOTHER VEHICLE SO THAT THE BUT WHEN YOU PARTICIPATE IN A SIDE SHOW YOU MAY NOT BE MAYBE LEADING UP TO A SPEECH CONTEST BUT YOU NAME ME NOT BE PARTICIPATING IN THIS BECAUSE AS PER SE. SO WE WOULD SAY THAT BOTH OF THOSE- ACTIVITIES AND BEHAVIORS ARE ARE EQUALLY DANGEROUS AND THAT AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE SOME PARITY. IN TERMS OF- THE OPPOSITION FROM THE SO YOU WE HAVE SPOKEN WITH THE CEO AND THE ASSEMBLY TRANSPORTATION BECAUSE THE COMMITTEE STAFF WHEN WE WERE. DEBATING THIS- AND BRING THIS FORWARD IN THE ASSEMBLY AND WE HAPPILY ACCEPTED AMENDMENTS TO ALLOW THE COURT TO RESTRICT THE DRIVERS. THAT COULD LEAD TO A DRIVER CONVICTED OF ENGAGING IN EXPRESSION SPEED TO BE ALLOWED TO DRIVE. THEIR VEHICLES TO AND FROM WORK AND IT ALSO GIVES THE COURT THE DISCRETION TO CONSIDER ANY BURDEN HE SUSPENDED DRIVER'S LICENSE WOULD HAVE ONE INDIVIDUAL OR INDIVIDUALS FAMILY AND GRANTS ACCORD THE FLEXIBILITY. TO ALLOW THE INDIVIDUAL TO- THE TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILY DRIVE TO WORK. BOTH BUT BOTH. BUT BECAUSE OF THE LOOP THAT EXISTS. SOMEONE MAY BE ABLE TO ENGAGE IN A- IN A- SIDE SHOW. ON A AND- HARMS THEM BY MADE IF YOU'RE DOING IT. AND IF YOU ARE A AND GET. THE YOU'RE- UP- HIGHWAY. OFFERING YOUR AND YOUR JEFF- THOSE ARE EQUALLY DANGEROUS BEHAVIORS THAT REQUIRE- THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THAT AND- TO HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL TOOLS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER FUN DID YOU HAVE A FOLLOW UP SENATOR AKOWSKI ADDRESS THE ONLY QUESTION IS THAT IF THE SIDE SHOW IS SET UP. THERE'S RIBBONS THERE'S BALLOONS EVERYBODY'S THERE WERE DOING THE SIDE SHOW BUT NOTHING. HAS STARTED. IS THAT. A SENSIBLE UNDER- THE V. THREE IT'S JUST IT'S JUST THE CONGREGATION WITH THE ANTICIPATION THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO THE SIDE SHOW. WITH IS IT IS THAT. THEY'RE STANDING THAT THAT SERVICE SO IS THIS- IF I CAN BE RESPONDED TO SHARE THIS A SIDE SHOW IS IT THE- THE BEHAVIOR OF PERFORMING STUNTS AT DANGEROUS SPEEDS THAT IS WHAT. THE EXPRESSION SPEED IS IT'S NOT JUST PEOPLE CONGREGATING- AND JUST WATCHING CARS PARKED ALONG. THE ROAD IT'S ACTUALLY DOING DONUTS DRIFTING- PERFORMING STUNTS- IN VERY CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE CROWD IN AND WE HAVE SEEN EXAMPLES. UNFORTUNATELY EVEN% HERE IN SACRAMENTO WHERE CARS HAVE LOST CONTROL AND GOING INTO THE CROWD AND HARMED AND. KILLED- YOUNG YOUNG INDIVIDUALS. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR MEMBER SENATOR- SENATOR SO. THANK YOU- THIS IS A- DAVE. D. TOWARD TO INCREASE PENALTIES UNDER THESE KIND OF CIRCUMSTANCES HAS. BEN INTRODUCED NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. AND IN PUBLIC SAFETY ANYWAY WHILE I WAS HERE WE DID NOT MOVE FORWARD TO FIND THESE BILLS AND THE REASON THAT WE DID NOT IS BECAUSE THE DATA THAT WE HAVE REVIEWED INDICATES THAT WHILE. I WELL CERTAINLY THERE IS THE- DESIRE TO INCREASE THE PENALTY WE FOUND NO DATA TO INDICATE THAT DOING SO REDUCE THE BEHAVIORS SO IN OTHER WORDS IF WE THINK ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCE WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO WE'RE TRYING TO PREVENT THE KIND OF CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THE FAMILY THAT WE HEARD FROM EXPERIENCE THAT IS WHAT THAT WOULD BE OBJECTIVE HOWEVER. THE INCREASE OF A PENALTY OF THE SORT DOES NOT HAVE THAT CONSEQUENCE YES IT PENALIZES SOMEONE WHO PARTICIPATES IN A SLIDE SHOW MORE BUT IT DOES NOT NECESSARILY REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF THEM. AND WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE- FOR EXAMPLE A LICENSE SUSPENSION- AND THE INABILITY THEN POTENTIALLY FOR A PERSON TO GO TO WORK AND SUCH THERE'S THEY CAN SPIRAL INTO MULTIPLE OTHER IMPACTS AND THIS DOES NOT THE THIS PARTICULAR BILL. THERE'S WHILE WE CERTAINLY DO NOT WANT TO HAVE ANY ANY INJURIES OR RESULTS OR ANY HARM TO PEOPLE BECAUSE OF ANY KIND OF ACTIVITY LIKE THIS THIS DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT ANYONE TO BE HURT AND SO AGAIN. IT'S THE CONCERN OF. SELECT DIFFERENT OR WHO AM UP BEING AT. UNDER UNDER INCREASING PENALTIES SO- I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT. AND I VERY MUCH RESPECT THE- THOSE- THE TESTIMONY WE HEARD IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT THE DANGER OF THESE BUT BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF DATA THAT SHOWS THAT IT WOULD ACTUALLY IMPACT THE REDUCTION OF THESE INCIDENTS I CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR SCANNER I DON'T SEE ANY MORE UP SENATOR MELINDA'S. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU IS SOME WOMEN FIND NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN- YOUR BILL DOESN'T REQUIRE THAT THE LICENSE IS SUSPENDED IT AUTHORIZES THE REVOCATION OF IS THAT CORRECT. YES EIGHT ALLOWS THE COURT TO MAKE A PROPER DECISION BASED ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES UPON CONVICTION NOT THE CITATION SO IF- AT ONCE- IF I THERE'S A FORMAL CONVICTION THE JUDGE WILL HAVE THE ABILITY- TO- TO IT. BUT REMOVE SOMEONE'S LICENSE BUT WHAT WE'RE ARGUING AND WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS NOT INCREASING PENALTIES BUT JUST TO CREATE PARITY BETWEEN THE TWO AT THE TWO BEHAVIORS. RIGHT OKAY AND THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME IT'S NOT A MANDATE IT'S AN OPTION THAT WE WOULD LEAVE UP TO THE DISCRETION OF THE JUDGE FOR INSTANCE IF YOU HAVE-A CASE WHERE SOMEONE IS BEFORE THE COURT FOR THIS VERY REASON MULTIPLE TIMES. THEN IT WOULD PROBABLY BE IN THE BEST INTEREST FOR PUBLIC SAFETY FOR A JUDGE TO REVOKE THAT LICENSE TO KEEP THE PUBLIC SAFE- IF HE FEELS THAT'S NECESSARY AND ARE YOU KNOW I'M NOT I'VE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE. ARGUMENT THAT- PUNISH TODAY DETER IF THAT IS THE ARGUMENT OVER TO USE THEN WHY. **** ANYBODY FOR ANYTHING. IF YOU CAN'T SOLIDLY PROVE THAT THE PUNISHMENT WILL DECREASE THE CRIME THEN WHY IN CURSOR TO ANYONE UNLESS THE GOAL IS TO. NOT INCARCERATE ANYONE FOR ANYTHING I'M NOT I'M NOT REALLY SURE BUT I THINK THIS IS- INTELLIGENT LEGISLATION FOR A PROBLEM THAT. HAS COME INTO BEING- THAT WE'VE NOT DEALT WITH IN THE PAST SO I THINK IT'S A GOOD PUBLIC SAFETY- EFFORT AND CERTAINLY GOOD TRANSPORTATION EFFORT AND SO WITH THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR MELINDA. SENATOR DELHI. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS LIKE. I DO I'M KIND OF BAFFLED BY THIS WAS HAPPENING HERE WE HAVE. REASONS FOR LOSS AND THEN WHEN PEOPLE. THERE'S CONSEQUENCES FOR BREAKING OFF. AND THIS IS A COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO AN ISSUE WHERE THE VICTIMS. IT CONTINUES TO HAPPEN INTEL INTEL YOU PUSH TO MAKE IT TO WHERE THE RISK IS HIGHER THAN THE PUNISHMENT YOU'LL CONTINUE TO SEE WHAT WE HAVE SO I WANT TO JUST SAY TO THE AUTHOR I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS BILL. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I BELIEVE YOU'VE- THIS BUILD OUT- VETOED BEFORE- I WILL MOVE THE BILL I THINK IT'S COMMON SENSE AND I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO- IN. GOOD LUCK THIS TIME WHEN YOU GET IT TO THE GOVERNOR. THANK YOU SENATOR DELHI AND WE'LL GO BACK TO SENATOR SKINNER. PRECIADO MADAM CHAIR I WANT TO CLARIFY I AM. AT INCHED HINDSIGHT TO MY COMMENTS WERE NOT. A COMPREHENSIVE ENOUGH CERTAINLY THEIR PUNISHMENT IS APPROPRIATE INDEPENDENT OF WHETHER IT pDETERS CRIME SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT MY COMMENTS WERE NOT CONSTRUED THAT SOMEHOW WE SHOULD NEVER PASS A LAW JUST BECAUSE IT DOESN'T DETER- ON WHAT I SHOULD HAVE SAID INSTEAD WHICH HAS BEEN BROUGHT OUT SO FAR IN THE TESTIMONY IS THAT WE HAVE EXISTING LAWS. THAT MAKE THIS A CRIME THAT HAVE CONSEQUENCES TO THIS AND THAT- WE'RE ON THE V. EIGHT THE STATE. IN FACT WHAT I SHOULD HAVE SAID THAT THIS IS SOMEONE DUPLICATE AND WHILE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT IS AND FEELS THERE NEEDS TO BE AN ADDITION. IT'S THERE IS EXISTING CODE ON THE BOOKS THAT DOES MAKE THIS ACTIVITY ILLEGAL WITH CONSEQUENCES. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER. I DON'T SEE ANYMORE MIKE'S UP I WILL CONCLUDE BY SAYING- I WANT TO THANK OU ASSEMBLYMEMBER FONG I KNOW WE HAD A QUICK DISCUSSION YESTERDAY AND- ALTHOUGH I'M ALSO OF THE MINDSET I DON'T WANT TO BE SUPER PUNITIVE ON ON CERTAIN ISSUES AND I BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW WE NEED TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE MINDFUL IN THE WAY WERE. ENFORCING AND HOW WE'RE CRAFTING- PUNISHMENTS FOR ENFORCEMENT IN IN ANY WAY I KNOW THAT THIS IS OPTIONAL AS YOU MENTIONED IT IS AN OPTION% BASED ON THE DEGREE OF THAT THE OFFENSE- BUT I'M OF THE MINDSET TO THAT WE NEED MORE EDUCATION OFTEN TIMES- EXHIBITION OF SPEED GETS CLUMPED IN WITH SPEED CONTESTS AND SO WE NEED TO BE. VERY CLEAR ON WHAT THAT IS AND I THINK THAT YOU'RE DOING THIS HERE WITH THIS LEGISLATION. AND AS WELL AS- MORE EDUCATION TO PEOPLE NEED TO BE EDUCATED ON EXACTLY WHAT EXACT EXHIBITION OF SPEED IS AND HOW NOT TO- TO CONDUCT THAT TYPE OF BEHAVIOR- AND SO THAT WAY WE CAN HAVE SAFER STREETS SO WITH THAT I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU AGAIN FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND WE WILL ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE THE GO RED HAT. I JUST LIKE TO THINK THAT SHE'S A YOUTH CHAIR FOR- FOR ALLOWING THIS BILL TO ADD TO IT TO BE PRESENTED AND TO THAT TO THE ROBUST CONVERSATION- CERTAINLY- THREE RACING IN THE EXHIBITION SPEED THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE THE NUMBER THE MEDITATIONS THE AMOUNT OF DEVASTATION REX TRAGEDIES- ARE ON THE RISE AT THEIR SURGING- AS WE'VE SEEN. AND THIS IS A BIPARTISAN EFFORT- THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE TAKE LIGHTLY- WE CERTAINLY WANT TO PROVIDE A REASONABLE APPROACH TO ADDRESSING THIS- THIS IS A GROUP BUT THIS ROOM SCOURGE IN ART AND OUR SOCIETY AND KEEPING OUR STREETS SAFE. AND WHY THIS BILL- IS IMPORTANT IS THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS SAID THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE PROPER TOOLS TO DEAL WITH SIDE SHOWS AT THE MOMENT AND SO THIS IS A REASONABLE STEP FORWARD TO ALLOW SOME DISCRETION TO CREATE PARITY BETWEEN- SPEAK CONTESTS AND EXHIBITIONS SPEED- WE'RE ALSO SEEING NOW THAT CITIES THEMSELVES. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OR ARE ARE GRAPPLING. WITH THIS- THIS THIS ACTIVITY- AND THEY'RE GOING TO. PROPOSE AND TO PASS LOCAL. I DEAL WITH SUCH A INTO. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE- IT'S GOING AWAY. HE SOON SO WE NEED TO ACT. AND ACT NOW AND SO I DO WANT TO US TO THINK- YES SARAH AND HER FAMILY WERE TRAVELING ALL THE WAY FROM BAKERSFIELD. THE SHARES STORY AND SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NIGHT THOUGH. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER AND THANK YOU TO SARAH AS WELL- THE BOOT. THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR DALLY.

EIGHTY NINE SEVENTY FOUR REQUIRES MINERS TO WEAR A HELMET WHEN RIDING A HORSE ON PAVED HIGHWAYS AND MANDATES THAT ALL WRITERS OR THEIR EQUINES WEAR REFLECTIVE GEAR OB OR LIGHTS AT SUNDOWN. ON AN OCTOBER EVENING IN TWENTY NINETEEN A VEHICLE STRUCK TWO INDIVIDUALS RIDING THEIR HORSES IN THE COMMUNITY OF LAKE VIEW TERRACE IN THE ITY OF LOS ANGELES WHICH IS LOCATED IN MY DISTRICT. THIS CRASH KILLED THE TWO HORSES AND LEFT THE TWO RIDERS IN CRITICAL CONDITION. MEMBERS OF MY COMMUNITY WHICH YOU WILL HEAR FROM SHORTLY BROUGHT THE SAFETY CONCERNS TO MY ATTENTION AFTER RESEARCHING THIS ISSUE WE FOUND SIMILAR COLLISIONS IN THE COMMUNITIES OF SAUGUS AND WILTON IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S COMMON REPORTS IS TO SHARE THE ROAD WITH VEHICLES HOWEVER IT CAN BE DIFFICULT FOR DRIVERS TO SEE RIDERS AND THEIR HORSES IN THE DARK. WHEN THESE COLLISIONS OCCUR THE WRITERS ARE USUALLY THROWN OFF OF THEIR HORSES LEAVING THEM IN CRITICAL CONDITION. THE HORSES USUALLY DIE UPON COLLISION OR MUST BE EUTHANIZED DUE TO THE INJURIES THAT THEY SUSTAINED. EIGHTY NINE SEVENTY FOUR IS A DIRECT DISTRICT GENERATED PROPOSAL THAT FURTHER PROTECTS RIDERS AND THEIR EQUINES THROUGH INCREASED VISIBILITY AND SAFETY MEASURES. TODAY I HAVE WITH ME TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL LEADERS OF THE EQUESTRIAN COMMUNITY IN LOS ANGELES- I HAVE GENE A CRUISE AND SHERRY BLOUSE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER MODERATOR WE WILL START WITH GINA CRUISE ON THE LINE EIGHTY THIRTY NINE CONSTITUENTS PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN. I THANK YOU- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- MY NAME IS GINA CRUISE I AM FROM THE COMMUNITY OF LAKEVIEW TERRACE AND I'M HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AT EIGHTY NINE SEVENTY FOUR. I LIVE ON A RANCH IN THE QUESTION COMMUNITY BUSINESS WITH URBAN AREA OF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES WITH MY FAMILY AND FIVE QUARTERS. LIKE MANY EQUESTRIANS. A MY DAUGHTER AND I REGULARLY WRITER. ON THE STREET. IN ORDER TO ADD. OUR LOCAL TRAIL. IT'S VERY COMMON TO SEE HORSES ON THE STREETS IN MY COMMUNITY. IN FACT MANY OF THE STREETS KNOCKING IN THE ARCTIC. DESIGNATED A QUESTION. WHAT WE- HAVE. IT CONTINUES BATTLE. ON THE- IS SEPARATE A QUESTION AND BE. OR TRAP. SO WE SHARE THE ROAD WITH THE- NOT TO. AGO THERE WERE THE TWO ACT. HERE ON THE BEACH INVOLVED A QUESTION. I AM TO BE A- AT- NUMBER- MENTION. A COUPLE IS WRITING A- CLICKABLE AT NIGHT WHEN THEY WERE. FROM BY A VEHICLE. THE WRITER CLICK COMPANY FORCES AND WHAT THE PURELY INJURED REQUIRING HOSPITALS. BOTH HORSES WERE KILLED. IF THE WRITERS HAVE BEEN WEARING REFLECTIVE GEAR. IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT THIS HORRIBLE ACCIDENT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST SUCH INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED HERE AND IT LIKELY. WILL NOT BE THE LAST ONE CHANGES ARE MADE. WHEN MY DAUGHTER AND I WRITE AT NIGHT ALWAYS WEAR A REFLECTIVE VEST. INPUT REFLECTED ON THE HORSES. IT REALLY IS A SMART THING TO DO NOT ONLY FOR THE SAFETY OF THE WRITERS AND HORSES. BUT FOR DRIVERS AS WELL SO THEY CAN SEE A FORMER ON THE ROAD THE BOY COLLISIONS. FOLLOWING ON A PAPER OKAY. YOU KNOW WHILE ADULTS CAN MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS ON THE LEVEL OF RISK THEY WANT TO PAY. IT REALLY IS IMPORTANT THAT CHILDREN BE PROTECTED. BY REQUIRING A WEAR A HELMET WHEN THEY'RE RIDING ON THE STREET. I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME TODAY AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE IN FAVOR OF. EIGHTY NINE SEVENTY FOUR TO INCREASE THE SAFETY AND THE ABILITY. OF THE QUESTIONS THAT HEART IS WHEN WE SHARE THE ROAD WITH VEHICLES. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU MISS CRUZ FOR TESTIMONY. OUR MODERATOR NEXT WE WILL GO TO SHERRY BLOWS ALSO IT AT AN ASSEMBLY DISTRICT THIRTY NINE CONSTITUENT. HELLO THIS IS GREAT. YES THIS IS SHERRY PLUS% I.

COMMUNITY TO LOOK FROM THE TRAIL. A LOT LOCAL FROM FROM WORK AFTER FORCES AND HEAD OUT THE TRAIL WHICH THEN MAKES RETURNING AFTER IT'S DARK. ARE YOU HAVE A DARK HORSE ON A DARK PRESIDENTIAL STREET AND ITS STRUCTURE AND- WELL WE HAVE A PROGRAM ACCIDENTS HERE IN BELMAR- INVOLVING DON'T FEEL COLD AND HORSES AND THE HORSES AND RIDERS ARE ALL WEEK ORGANISERS. REPORTING OF THE FACTS IS ALSO. IMPORTANT SO IT'LL HELP US MARKET STREET WHAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE SAFER PASSAGE WITH PROPER SIGNAGE. REQUIRING HELMETS FOR EIGHTEEN AND UNDER IS REALLY A NO BRAINER MOST WRITERS ARE A LOT OF WRITERS ALREADY WEAR HELMET BUT A MANDATE WOULD HELP MAKE SURE. CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF. EIGHTEEN ARE RIGHT YOU'RE GOING TO BE EIGHTEEN. REALLY AND BILL TO HELP US PROVIDE.

MEMBERS SENATOR MELINDA IS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- SO THE BILL REQUIRES OF WEARING A HELMET FOR THOSE EIGHTEEN AND UNDER. CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY IT'S JUST EIGHTEEN AND UNDER BECAUSE I PRESUME THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE INJURY THAT CAN RESULT FROM HITTING YOUR HEAD. NOT WEARING HELMET WHICH I ALSO PRESUME IS A DANGER TO- SOMEONE OF ANY AGE NOT JUST EIGHTEEN AND UNDER SO I JUST WARNING IF YOU COULD FURTHER EXPAND ON WHY IT'S ONLY EIGHTEEN AND UNDER- NO I A. I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN AND- FOR THIS BILL WE FOCUSED. ON MINORS- BECAUSE LIKE OF ONE OF MY WITNESSES TESTIFIED WE BELIEVE ADULTS CAN MAKE THEIR DECISIONS AND WE HAVE A LOT OF ADULTS THAT ARE. EQUESTRIAN RIDERS THAT DO WEAR HELMETS- ON THEM YOU KNOW THEY THEY MAKE THAT DECISION- BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT MINERS ARE SAFE. BUT I AGREE I BELIEVE EVERYONE SHOULD WEAR A HELMET. OKAY I JUST. AND I APPRECIATE YOUR- CLARIFICATION AND I RECOGNIZE THAT THE BILL IS FOCUSING ON MINORS I GUESS I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IF IT'S IF IT'S FOR THE PURPOSES OF SAFETY I'M AN ADULT WHO FALLS AND HITS THEIR HEAD IS JUST AS MUCH AS RISK AS SOMEONE WHO IS SEVENTEEN- SO- BUT THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION.
