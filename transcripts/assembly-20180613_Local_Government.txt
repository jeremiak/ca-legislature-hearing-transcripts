CONTRACT FOR PROJECT THE GUARANTEES THE COST OF THE PROJECT IN FURNISHES CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT SERVICES. PROJECTS THAT HAVE MULTIPLE PHASES LEND THEMSELVES TO THIS METHOD. BECAUSE THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE PROJECT CAN PER. AT DIFFERENT TIMES. AUTHORIZING THIS METHOD PROCUREMENT WILL PROVIDE COUNTIES WITH THE NECESSARY TOOL TO DELIVER FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. ENSURE HIGH QUALITY CONSTRUCTION AT A GUARANTEED MAXIMUM PRICE. REDUCE PUBLIC SECTOR LIABILITY AND IS SURE MORE TIMELY COMPLETION OF PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS. LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE AUTHORIZED SEE MARK TO BE USED FOR BUILDING PROJECTS IN THAT PROPOSAL PASSED UNANIMOUSLY WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. SP NIGHT FOURTEEN GRANTS COUNTIES THE FLEXIBILITY TO BUILD PROJECTS THEY NEED IN THE MOST EFFICIENT MANNER POSSIBLE WHICH TRANSLATES TO SAVINGS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND TAXPAYERS LIKE.

REAVIS HERE VOEPEL [inaudible] VOEPEL HERE. I DON'T CONTINUE -- YOUR SUPPORTERS. FEEL FREE GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE KIANA VALENTINE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. I AS THE SENATOR STATED THE PURPOSE OF NINE FOURTEEN IS TO EXPAND THE TOOLS COUNTIES HAVE TO PLAN AND DELIVER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. IN A TIMELY EFFICIENT AND COST EFFECTIVE MANNER. AT WHILE THE TRADITIONAL METHOD OF DESIGN BID BUILD AYE IS AN APPROPRIATE DELIVERY METHOD FOR MANY TYPES OF INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. SOME COUNTIES HAVE FOUND SUCCESS USING ALTERNATIVE DELIVERY METHOD SUCH AS DESIGN BUILD AND SEE MARK. NINE FOURTEEN PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL OPTION AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT IT IS AN OPTION IT TOOL IN THE TOOL KIT TO DELIVER COMPLEX PROJECTS WITH MULTIPLE BENEFITS. SUCH AS EARLY CONTRACTOR INVOLVEMENT COST PREDICTABILITY ENHANCE SCHEDULE CONTROLS AND RISK MITIGATION -- AT THE SENATOR MENTIONED ARTIE CON IS C. SACKS RESIDENT EXPERT ON SEA MAR SO I WANTED TO FOR A MAJORITY OF MY TIME. TO HURT TO TALK ABOUT THAT ASPECTS OF SEA MAR THAT I THINK THE COMMITTEE WILL BE INTERESTED IN BUT I DID WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE. THAT NINE FOURTEEN MERELY EXPANDS EXISTING COUNTY AUTHORITY TO OTHER TYPES OF INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS WE ARE NOT AMENDING THE PROJECT COSTS THRESHOLD IN NEW LA ALREADY OF ONE MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE. IT DOES NOT AMEND THE SKILLED TRAINED WORKFORCE PROVISIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED UNANIMOUSLY AND AB EIGHT FIVE ONE JUST LAST YEAR. I S. B. NINE FOURTEEN DOESN'T CHANGE THE WAY IN WHICH THE CONTRACT IS COMPETITIVELY PROCURED AND LASTLY A THE EXISTING SEA MAR THIRTY IS SET TO SUNSET AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE SO THE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW SEA MAR. THIRTY AND ITS APPLICATION TO THESE OTHER TYPES OF INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN JUST A FEW YEARS THANK YOU THANK YOU. WELCOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON -- DOWN CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS NOT ECONOMY DEPUTY DIRECTOR WITH ORANGE COUNTY PUBLIC WORKS. AND I JUST WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHAT SEE MAR IS AND WHAT IT DOES -- AND I'LL BE GLAD TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS TRADITIONAL METHOD OF DESIGN FIT BUILT A CONTRACTOR IS SPECIFICALLY PRECLUDED BY LAW FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE DESIGN PHASE OF THE PROJECT. THIS CREATES A SITUATION WHERE IN THE COUNTY AND ITS DESIGNER WORK TOGETHER TO PRODUCE A PLAN -- SPECIFICATIONS AND ESTIMATES ONLY TO HAND OF THOSE OVER TO A CONTRACTOR THAT HAS HAD NO INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROCESS UNTIL THE PROJECT IS ADVERTISE WHAT COMES IN LATE -- CONVERSELY THE SEA MAR MEANT THAT -- REQUIRES THAT THE MOST QUALIFIED CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE IN THE DESIGN PHASE UP PROVIDING CONSTRUCTIVE BILLY REVIEWS VALUE ENGINEERING ALTERNATIVES AND GUARANTEED MAXIMUM PRICE. WOULD SEE MARK COST ESCALATIONS ARE MITIGATED THROUGH THE EARLY INVOLVEMENT OF THE CONTRACTOR SELECTED AS THE MOST QUALIFIED TO BUILD A SPECIFIC PROJECT. ADDITIONALLY THE CONTRACTORS REQUIRED INVOLVEMENT IN THE DESIGN PHASE ALLOWS FOR A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH TO RESOLVING ISSUES AND ALLOWS THE CONTRACTOR TO RECOMMEND DESIGNED ADJUSTMENTS THAT BETTER ALIGNED WITH HOW THE CONTRACTOR PLANS TO BUILD THE PROJECT. FINALLY THE CONTRACT IS AFFORDED THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK FOR ADDITIONAL RESEARCH OR INFORMATION TO BETTER COMPLETELY GUARANTEED MAXIMUM PRICE. THROUGH EARLY INVOLVEMENT BY THE MOST QUALIFIED CONTRACTOR WE FEEL THAT THE OPPORTUNITY IS ENHANCE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SCHEDULE THAT HAS HIGHER SUCCESS RATE FOR ON TIME DELIVERY. ALSO THE TRADITIONAL ARE LOW BUT PROCESS ONLY GUARANTEES LOWEST INITIAL PRICE AND IN ALMOST ALL CASES WE SEE -- ARE CHANGE ORDERS I DID WHEN WE HAVE COMPLEX PROJECTS -- IN SUMMARY THE SEA MAR DELIVERY METHOD IS BEST UTILIZED FOR COMPLEX HIGH RISK PROJECTS WITH MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS WERE BUDGET AND SCHEDULE CONSTRAINTS OUR PRIMARY CONCERN. UNFORTUNATELY COUNTIES ARE CURRENTLY LIMITED FROM UTILIZING SEEM ARE ONLY EXCEPT FOR OWNED OR LEASED BUSINESS A BUILDINGS EXCUSE ME. I'M CLOSING THE SEA MAR A DELIVERY METHOD IS AN OPTION FOR INCREASING THE RATE OF SUCCESS FOR MAJOR CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. AND COUNTY SIMPLY DESIRE TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE RIGHT JOB AN SP NINE FOURTEEN GIVES THE COUNTIES ANOTHER TOOL IN OUR TOOLBOX SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AND HAVE BEEN ANSWERING QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE OTHERS UP.

TO THIS CRITICAL SECTION OR I SHOULD SAY REINSTATES AN UPDATE SCHEDULE TO THIS CRITICAL SECTION OF GENERAL PLAN LAW THAT WAS ORIGINALLY ESTABLISHED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WITH. A BILL I AUTHORED S. B.. THREE SEVENTY NINE AND ITS SETS FORTH THE REQUIREMENT THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MUST UPDATE THEIR SAFETY ELEMENT FOR CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCY STRATEGIES WHEN THEY UPDATE THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT. OR THEIR LOCAL HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN WHICHEVER SERVES THE LOCAL PLANNING PROCESS BETTER. THIS PROVISION STILL REQUIRES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO UPDATE THEIR SAFETY ELEMENTS ON A REGULAR BASIS. ALLOWING NO MORE THAN EIGHT YEARS BETWEEN UPDATES. AND THIS UPDATE REQUIREMENT REQUIRES FREQUENT BUT FLEXIBLE APPROACHES ENSURING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS REGULARLY UPDATE THEIR GENERAL PLANS AS NEW ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS EMERGE AND OF COURSE WE KNOW. THAT WITH CLIMATE CHANGE AND NEW ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS A OCCURRING AS A RESULT WHETHER ITS FIRES WHETHER IT'S FLOODS THAT HAVE. A RECONFIGURED THE LANDSCAPE AND THOSE CHANGED ARE THE OF FLOOD PLANNING IN FLIGHT CONTROL ISSUES OF AN AREA. JUST AS A WILD EXAMPLE HYPOTHETICAL OF COURSE.

THE MOTION AS DO PASS AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS ACT WHERE CURRY. WALDRON BLOOM AYE BLOOM AYE CABALLERO [inaudible] GABRIEL. GABRIEL I GRAYSON LACKEY. LACKEY I READ THIS. REAVIS I'VE VOEPEL. VOEPEL HIGH. THANK YOU YOUR VOTE UP. FIVE ZERO AND IT -- MISTER ALLEN AND I THINK -- YOU'RE HERE TO PRESENT THE SP NIGHT. SIXTY THREE IF THAT'S RIGHT THANK YOU. MISTER BLOOM AGUILAR CARRY. YEAH THAT CLOSER FROM HER NAME SUDDENLY GOT LONGER [inaudible] UNIVERSITY -- LET ME LET ME START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE FOR ITS ANALYSIS IN AGREEING TO THE TACTICAL AMENDMENT THAT'S OUTLINED A COMMENT. FOR OF YOUR NOW SEES MEMBERS IT RELATIVE TO THE TERMINOLOGY WHICH OUTLINES A DISH THE AUDITING REQUIREMENTS. IN THE BILL. SO SP. NINE SIXTY THREE REPEALS A SECTION THE WATER COULD PLACING A TEN MILLION DOLLAR CAP ON THE GENERAL RESERVE FUND OF THE WATER REPLENISHMENT DISTRICT. IT REQUIRES THAT A MINIMUM OF EXPENDED SPECIFICALLY. FOR WATER PURCHASES. THESE RESTRICTIONS WERE PUT IN PLACE EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO IN THE WAKE OF A STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT THAT FOUND THE WATER PLEDGE INDUSTRY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S ASSESSMENT RATES. WERE TOO HIGH THAT THE DISTRICT MAINTAINED EXCESSIVE. CASH RESERVES. NOW NO OTHER INDEPENDENT SPECIAL DISTRICT IS SUBJECT TO RESTRICTION ON ITS RESERVES. AND IN THE YEARS SINCE THESE RESTRICTIONS WERE IMPOSED. THE WATER REPLENISHMENT DISTRICT THE ONLY WATER PUNCH FOR DISTURBING THE STATE THAT'S I'M KNOW JUST AS THE W. ARE D.. HAS SUBSEQUENTLY WON MULTIPLE AWARDS FOR ITS FISCAL PRACTICES AND TRANSPARENCIES. SO THEY ARE THEY'VE GOT THEIR ACT TOGETHER O. AFTER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME AND I THINK WE'RE NOW AT THE PLACE WHERE WE CAN. AND WE CAN CHANGE AROUND SOME OF THESE RULES IN IN A WAY THAT WILL ACTUALLY MEET. THE CURRENT STATE OF PLAY IN TERMS OF WATER PROCUREMENT SO ME EXPLAIN HOW THAT THE RULES RIGHT NOW ARE ARE. CRITICS IN CHALLENGES FIRST OF ALL THE RESTRICTIONS THAT PREVENTED THE WRT FROM ACCUMULATING. I NECESSARILY HIRE RESERVE LEVELS IN WATER THE WATER PURCHASE REQUIREMENT. MADE SENSE AT THE TIME BUT NOW I TIMES AND GROUNDWATER REPLENISHING BEST PRACTICES IF CHANGE SO FLUCTUATIONS IN COST. AND IN RELIABILITY OF SUPPLY HAVE [inaudible] PRACTICAL NEED TO BECOME INDEPENDENT OF IMPORTED WATER SHIFTING INSTEAD TO THE PRODUCTION OF LOCAL RELIABLE SUPPLIES FOR PURPOSES OF REPLENISHING THE CENTRAL WEST COAST GROUND WATER BASINS. SO THE IDEA WAS AT THE TIME THEY WANTED THE MONEY TO GO TOWARD WATER PURCHASES BY THERE'S NOW. A LOT MORE -- OF A PUSH TOWARD LOCAL PRODUCTION. AND SO THAT THERE'S JUST BEEN A SHIFT IN THE IN THE WAY THAT THEY'VE BEEN THAT THEY COME TO SEE THEIR BUSINESS MODEL AND IT. AND IT'S VERY MUCH A COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL BEST PRACTICES NOUN A COURSE IN FOR THOSE WHO ARE FROM THE AREA YOU'LL YOU'LL LIKE THE FACT THAT WERE. I'M TRYING. TO REDUCE LOS ANGELES'S RELIANCE ON OTHER REGIONS FOR WATER SO THE WB'S WATER INDEPENDENCE NOW NGUYEN. W. AYE AND PROGRAM AIMS TO ELIMINATE THE NEED TO PURCHASE IMPORTED WATER FROM. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND FROM THE COLORADO RIVER FOR GROUNDWATER REPLENISHMENT. AND ONCE FULLY ESTABLISHED THE DEPUTIES REGIONS I GROUNDWATER BASES WILL WILL COMPLETELY BE LOCALLY SUSTAINABLE LOCALLY SOURCED WHICH IS THAT DOT THE PLANET'S OF ONE I THINK WE OUGHT TO SUPPORT. SO THIS BILL PERMITS THE WB TO BETTER MANAGE ITS FINANCES FOR CHANGING WATER CONDITIONS AND DEMANDS. IT PROVIDES A W. THE ABILITY TO SHIFT AWAY FROM OUTDATED RELIABILITY AND WATER IMPORTS TO MODERN MODEL OF LOCAL SOURCING AND SUSTAINABILITY WHILE. PLANNING FOR SUBSTANTIAL OPERATING COSTS THAT IT WILL ENCOURAGE FINANCING ITS ADVANCE WATER TREATMENT FACILITIES THE BILL WILL LIMIT THE ULTIMATE PRICE TO TAXPAYERS. BY PERMITTING COST TO BE ADDRESS ON A PAY AS YOU GO BASIS RATHER THAN THROUGH MORE EXPENSIVE DEBT FINANCING THE BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION ITS GUARD GOING TO BIPARTISAN SUPPORT NIGHT. RESPECT YES RIGHT VOTE. THANK YOU WITNESSES SINCE WE WERE. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS BOB READ WITH READ GOVERNMENT RELATIONS ON BEHALF OF THE WATER REPLENISHMENT DISTRICT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS IF THERE ARE COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE ANY. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. FATHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE.

OKAY -- SECRETARY PUT FIVE WHOLE THE RULE EMOTION IS DO PASS AS AMENDED AGUIAR-CURRY AYE AGUIAR-CURRY AYE WALDRON BLOOM. BLOOM AYE CABALLERO GABRIEL. GABRIEL I GRAYSON LACKEY. LACKEY AYE. GRIEVOUS. REAVIS I'VE VOEPEL. PROPEL AYE. OKAY BILLS US IT'S REALLY REALLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH HAVE A GOOD AFTERNOON. LET'S MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER -- SEVEN CENTER LEYVA SP ONE ONE FOUR FIVE WELCOME SENATOR. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND NEW MEMBERS WELCOME. ON HIS COULD HAVE GOOD NEW PEOPLE IN THE LEGISLATURE. S. B. ELEVEN FORTY FIVE AUTHORIZES ENHANCED INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICTS OR E. I. F. DIS TO DO MAINTENANCE ON THE FACILITIES THAT THEY BUILT. BAFTAS ARE AN IMPORTANT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FINANCE TOOL FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO MOVE COMMUNITY PROJECTS FORWARD. CITIES AND COUNTIES CAN CREATE E. I. F. DIS TO BUILD WATER SYSTEMS. CHILD CARE FACILITIES PARKS AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING AMONG SEVERAL OTHER COMMUNITY BENEFIT PROJECTS. THERE ARE CURRENTLY OVER TWENTY FIVE EEF DIS ACROSS THE STRAIGHT STATE THAT ARE EITHER APPROVED OR IN THE STUDY PHASE. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE CONSIDERING ESTABLISHING E. IFT ARE FACING THE CURRENT LIMITATION ON MAINTAINING THE PROJECTS THAT WILL BE BUILT. AS YOU KNOW LONG TERM MAINTENANCE COSTS ARE OFTEN TIMES OVERLOOKED IN THESE TYPE OF DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. PRESENTLY III OF DIS CANNOT PAY FOR MAINTENANCE ROUTINE REPAIRS OR OPERATIONS THIS SITUATION IS PROBLEMATIC SINCE MANY COMMUNITIES WILL NEED FUNDS FROM THESE DISTRICTS TO MAINTAIN THE STRUCTURES OVER TIME. S. B. ELEVEN FORTY FIVE ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PRO ACTIVELY BUDGET MAINTENANCE COSTS FROM THE I FD REVENUES RATHER THAN RELY ON VOLATILE GENERAL FUNDS. VERY VERY CLEAR THE BILL DOES NOT ASK FOR NEW FUNDS TAXES OR FEES IT WILL HOWEVER ALLOW THE AYE IF THESE TO MAINTAIN FACILITIES PROPERLY AND PROTECT LOCAL TAXPAYER INVESTMENTS IN THE LONG TERM. WITH ME HERE TODAY IS AARON LOW. MORAL THEY FIT RIGHT AARON RIGHT. UP WHO IS THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND HOUSING DIRECTOR FOR THE CITY OF WEST SACRAMENTO AND IS REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AARON. AND HERE'S A GENTLEMAN HAS USE THE TOOL SO WELCOME AND THANK YOU. KNOW THAT'S TRUE -- SO AGAIN THERE. THE MEASURE WAS SACRAMENTO SO -- WE WERE THANK YOU WE WERE THE FIRST -- STE A CITY IN THE STATE -- TO FORMING I'VE D. WERE NOW IN THE OF USING IT -- TO BUILD ALL SORTS OF PROJECTS SO -- THAT ISSUE IS THE ISSUE FOR WAS SACRAMENTO IS AN ONGOING MAINTENANCE BUT I CAN SPEAK FOR CALOTES MEMBERSHIP IT IS AN ISSUE ACROSS THE STATUS THEY CITIES LOOK AT THIS TOOL. SO I WANT TO GIVE A COUPLE OF PRACTICAL EXAMPLES FIRST DUB KIND OF FRAMING THE PROBLEMS ONE CITIES I DON'T THINK A LOT OF YOU HAVE LOOKED GOVERNMENT BACKGROUNDS YOU CAN APPRECIATE THIS WERE REALLY GOOD AT BUILDING THINGS. BUT IT'S VERY HARD TO BUDGET MONEY FOR MAINTENANCE THAT'S JUST A FACT OF LIFE IN CITY GOVERNMENT -- NOW THE ID'S ARE IN PLACE THEY ARE ALSO CONTEMPLATED BE MULTI JURISDICTIONAL OR TO WORK ON PROJECTS ACROSS. AGENCY LINES AND SO THAT'S ANOTHER IMPETUS FOR THIS BILL SO JUST FOR EXAMPLE WERE BUILDING A PROJECT WAS THAT THE CITY WHAT OF SACRAMENTO TO BRIDGE -- THAT WILL REPLACE THE OLD AYE STREET BRIDGE OF SO BLOODY PRIVATELY WITH THAT. THAT PROJECT IS BY ITS NATURE TO SEE PROJECT IT'S GONNA BE VERY EXPENSIVE TO MAINTAIN AND OUR A I'VE THE WILL HELP FINANCE IT IS IT LIKELY TO BE MAINTAINED AND OPERATED BY SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE A GPA. THIS CONCEPT WOULD APPLY HERE IS THAT THE I'VE D. COULD ACTUALLY BUDGET ONGOING FUNDS. THROUGH A MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT WITH THE JPA. PAGE YOU GO MANY. THE IDEA WOULD GENERATE I'D TAKE CARE OF THE MAINTENANCE FOR THE LIFESPAN OF THE BRIDGE AND THAT'S A MUCH MORE RESPONSIBLE WAY OF BUDGETING FOR MAINTENANCE THAN RELYING ON ONGOING. AND LIMITED REVENUES FROM GENERAL FUND BUDGET SO -- WITH THE I'M HERE TO ANSWER. ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE OF AND AND RESPECT WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS IS ABOUT LIKE I SAID A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR CALLIN CHINE. AND IN ITS EFFORT TO BE A LEADER ON THIS SIDE TAX INCREMENT ISSUE STATEWIDE SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANYONE ELSE AND SUPPORT OF THE BILL. SING IN AND IS THERE ANYONE IN. OH OKAY THERE'S A SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I MATTHEW HARD TO THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS PROPERTIES ASSOCIATION. YOU PROBABLY NORMALLY SEE ME ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE TABLE THIS GENTLEMAN ON THINGS LIKE THIS. BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THAT YEAH IF THE IS SOMETHING THAT'S ON THE AND EVOLVING ISSUE AYE WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT. AYE OUR MEMBERS -- ARE DEFERRING TO CAL AT ON THIS. ONE BUT WE BELIEVE THAT. THEY SHOULD BE ABLE CITY SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY. TO FUND THE THINGS THAT THEY BUILD SO -- WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL -- EARLIER I DON'T THINK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. SING THEN WILL MOVE TO OPPOSITION NEWMAN OPPOSITION. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON DAVID WOLF AT THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION OPPOSED UNFORTUNATELY TO THE BILL TODAY. AND WHILE MISTER HERGER OF MENTION THAT USUALLY WE'RE ON THE SAME SIDE OF TABLE LEAST ON THIS BILL WE ARE AT THE TABLE WHICH IS GOOD NEWS -- MEMBERS IT'S BEEN STATED THAT THE INTENT OF THE PROPONENTS IS TO ENSURE THAT HE OF IDEAS HAVE THE ABILITY TO USE PAGE YOU GO FUNDS TO FUND MAINTENANCE PROJECTS THAT LAST LESS THAN FIFTEEN YEARS. IF THAT IS TRULY THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATION WE HAVE NO OBJECTION TO THAT AND WILL IN FACT PROPER OPPOSITION. HOWEVER THAT'S NOT WHAT WE THINK THE BILL SAYS. WHAT THE BILL DOES PROHIBIT ROUTINE MAINTENANCE FROM BEING PAID WITH BOND FUNDS WE DO THINK IT CREATES A LOOPHOLE WHEREBY THE ONGOING OR CAPITALIZE COST TO MAINTAIN PUBLIC CAPITAL FACILITIES? UNQUOTE WHICH WE BELIEVE TO BE PROJECTS WITH LIFE CYCLE COSTS OF LESS THAN FIFTEEN YEARS COULD IN FACT BE FUNDED WITH BOND DOLLARS. MEMBERS WE'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT BONDS OF ALL TYPES SHOULD RECEIVE TWO THIRDS VOTER APPROVAL AS ONGOING DEBT. THAT THEY SHOULD BE SPENT ON CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT LAST THOUGH AND FOR THE BLIND AND NOT BASED ON ON GOING REACHING MAINTENANCE OF ANY KIND -- AS I MENTIONED PROPONENTS INITIATE CARE DO APPEAR TO BE SOMEWHAT ON THE SAME PAGE HERE. I DID REQUEST COMMITTEE STAFF THAT THE BILL BE PUT OVER TILL LATER THIS MONTH HOWEVER THAT OFFER WAS REJECTED SO UNFORTUNATELY WE DO HAVE TO BE HERE. TEAIRRA SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL BUT WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- IS THERE ANY OTHER OPPOSITION.
