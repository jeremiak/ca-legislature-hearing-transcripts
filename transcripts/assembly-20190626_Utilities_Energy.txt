THE UTILITIES AND COMMITTEE UTILITIES AND ENERGY COMMITTEE -- WE ARE SHORT OF A QUORUM BUT I RECOGNIZE THE PRESENCE OF ONE OF OUR AUTHORS AND SIR DODD WOULD LIKE -- TO IF YOU DON'T MIND OPERATE AS A SUB COMMITTEE AND THEN WE WILL. TAKE YOUR TESTIMONY [inaudible] AND WE WELCOME YOU TODAY YOU'RE HERE TO PRESENT ON SENATE BILL. TWO FORTY SEVEN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR [inaudible] MEMBERS. LET ME BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT ON PAGE SIX OF THE ANALYSIS. AS WE ALL KNOW EXTREME WEATHER IS INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES IN THE LENGTH OF THE WILDFIRE SEASON. ACCORDING TO CAL FIRE TWELVE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WERE CAUSED BY ELECTRIC POWER IN DISTRIBUTION LIGHTS. CONDUCTORS AND POWER POLES CAL FIRE CITED TREES ARE PARTS OF TREES FALLING ON THE POWER LINES AS THE SPECIFIC CAUSE FOR THOSE FIRES. ADEQUATE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IS CRITICAL TO REDUCING. THE RISK OF TREES AND BRUSH CONTACTING ELECTRICAL LINES AND EQUIPMENT. PART OF CALPERS MISSION IS TO PREVENT FOREST FIRES FIRES. I CAL FIRES. IN A FIRE PREVENTION PROGRAM INCLUDES WILDFIRE PRE FIRE ENGINEERING VEGETATION MANAGEMENT FIRE PLANNING EDUCATION AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. IN ANY RESTRUCTURING OF THE C.. AS A PERTAINS TO SAFETY ENFORCEMENT AS SUGGESTED BY THE GOVERNOR NEWSOME LAST WEEK. CALPERS UNIQUELY SITUATED TO DETERMINE WHAT VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IS NECESSARY TO REDUCE THE CHANCE OF A WILDFIRE. UNDER CURRENT LAW INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES MUST PROVIDE THE CBC WITH VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PLAN AS PART OF THE I. O. U. WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLAN. FURTHER UNDER CURRENT LAW THE CBC MUST CONSULT WITH CAL FIRE WHEN REVIEWING AND APPROVING EACH WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLAN. SB TWO FORTY SEVEN WOULD REQUIRE CAL FIRE TO AUDIT EACH ELECTRICAL CORPORATIONS VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WORK TO ENSURE THAT THE UTILITIES SATISFACTORILY CARRIED. OUT THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WORK SET FORTH IN ITS WHILE FIRE MITIGATION PLAN. FINALLY BECAUSE VEGETATION MANAGE WORK IS VERY DANGEROUS SB TWO FORTY SEVEN ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE VEGETATION MAYES WORK BE PERFORMED. BY QUALIFIED LYING CLEARANCE TREE TRIMMERS ARE QUALIFIED WHITE CLARENCE TREE TRIMMER TRAINEES. RECENTLY JUDGE ALSO OVERSEE P. GENIES PROBATION IN THE SAID BRITTLE CASE SAID P. JEANNIE HASN'T CUT THE RIGHT TREES AND MANAGING VEGETATION. IN IN NEAR ITS POWER LIGHTS. IN RESPONSE. P. JEANNIE SAID AND I QUOTE THERE'S A LOT OF TREES OUT THERE AND WE DON'T HAVE ALL HIGHS ON ALL OF THEM. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I IT'S A BIT LET'S GET THE ELECTRICAL UTILITIES THE EYES THE NEED -- TO ADEQUATELY MANAGE EDUCATION AND CUT THE RIGHT TREES I BELIEVE WITH THE AMENDMENTS TAKE IT IN THE SENATE. ALL OPPOSITION HAS BEEN REMOVED. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE BOAT. WITH ME HERE TODAY ARE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE COALITION OF CALIFORNIA UTILITY EMPLOYEES. I THINK IS THE CHAIR MARK JOSEPH ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION OF CALIFORNIA TILL THE EMPLOYEES. THIS BILL WILL REDUCE THE CHANCE OF A FUTURE FIRE BECAUSE UTILITY FAILED TO TRIM A TREE. RIGHT NOW THE UTILITY DECIDES WHAT TREES NEED TO BE TRIMMED. IT PERFORMS A WORK AND THEN IT OUGHT ITS ITS OWN WORK. IT'S MOSTLY DONE WITH CONTRACTORS. AFTER A FIRE. CAL FIRE INVESTIGATES DECIDES WHAT CAUSED THE FIRE AND SOMETIMES THEY FIND THAT THE FAILURE TO TRIM A TREE THAT SHOULD'VE BEEN TRIMMED WAS THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE. NO IT'S REALLY NICE TO KNOW AFTER THE FACT BUT TO BE MUCH BETTER IF WE KNEW IT BEFORE THE FIRE OCCURRED. THIS BILL WOULD HAVE CAL FIRE AUDIT THE UTILITIES WORK RIGHT AWAY BEFORE THE FIRE. AND TELL THE UTILITY IF IT'S MISS SOMETHING. THEN THE AGILITY HAS A CHANCE TO FIX THE MISTAKE RIGHT AWAY. THEN CAL FIRE REPORTS THE RESULTS OF ITS AUDIT TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. THIS WILL CREATE A VERY POWERFUL INCENTIVE FOR THE UTILITY TO FIX. EVERY VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROBLEM THAT CALIFORNIA IDENTIFIES BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T AND THAT CAUSES A FIRE. THERE WILL BE A PAPER TRAIL SHOWING THE AGILITY WAS WARNED AND FAILED TO ACT. WE DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WE EXPECT THE UTILITY TO JUMP ON EVERY PROBLEM THE CALIFORNIA IDENTIFIES. CALIFORNIA AUDITING UTILITY WORK IS A MUCH BETTER SYSTEM THAN SELF AUDITING. THE BILL DOES NOT INCREASE ANY EXPENSE FOR CALIFORNIA -- BECAUSE CAL FIRE WOULD BE REIMBURSED BY THE UTILITY FOR ITS AUDITING WORK. THE BILL WOULD GREATLY IMPROVE THE VEGETATION MATTER FOR PROCESS AND RESULT IN FEWER FIRES CAUSED BY MISTAKES AND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. THANK YOU. SCOTT FOR YOU. WE DO HAVE A QUORUM SO IF WE CAN PROSPER MOMENT WILL TAKE A TAKE THE ROLE. HOLDEN HERE HOLDING HERE PATTERSON. IN HERE BURKE. CARILLO CARILLO HERE CHEN CUNNINGHAM. EGGMAN EGGMAN HERE CRISTINA GARCIA EDUARDO GARCIA MAYES. WE'RE SEARCHING. SHE HERE QUIRK. WORK HERE REYES. HERE'S HERE'S SANTIAGO TEAM THEIR TEAM HERE PHARMACIST DEVILISH. MOVE THE BELL. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOT WHAT SHOULD BE AT THE STATE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS JUST VERY QUICKLY THE SECOND PORTION OF THE BILL HAS TO DO WITH TRYING TO INSURE BETTER TRAINING. AND ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THE WORK FORCE THAT GOES OUT AND DOES THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. BECAUSE OF THE VAST AMOUNT OF RESOURCES THAT HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON VEGETATION MANAGEMENT OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS DUE TO THE WILDFIRE THREAT AT ALL THREE OF THE I. O. U.'S. WE HAVE A NEW PHENOMENON WHERE YOU HAVE SEVERAL TIERS OF SUBCONTRACTORS -- THE TYPICAL TRIP. EVEN VEGETATION MANAGEMENT CONTRACTORS THE UTILITIES USE HAVE NOW HAVE SECOND AND THIRD AND FOURTH AND FIFTH TIER SUBCONTRACTORS IN ORDER TO GET THE VOLUME OF THE WORK DONE. THE PROBLEM IS THE TRAINING HAS A FOLLOW TO THOSE OTHER TWO YEARS OF OF CONTRACTORS SO THE NUMBER OF SERIOUS INJURIES AND DEATHS HAVE -- ESCALATED AT AN ALARMING RATE SO THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE -- THAT THE I. O. U.'S INSURER THAT THE WORK FORCE THIS PERFORMING THAT -- QUALIFIED THE CLICK THE TREE. AND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT -- THAT THOSE WORKERS ALL BE QUALIFIED FOR LYING CLEARANCE TREE TRIMMERS OR TRAINEES AND THAT WAY WE CAN ENSURE THAT THE APPROPRIATE TRAINING PROGRAMS ARE IN PLACE. AND SO FOR THAT REASON WE'D ORIGIN I'VE. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE ELSE HERE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE BILL. I WE'RE PREPARED TO HE WHO IS IN FAVOR. WELL I JUST WELL NOW LET'S GET THE MICROPHONE. GOOD -- UNDER STERN I WOULD HAVE A TWELVE FORTY FIVE WERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL -- WITHIN MOMENTS THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE HERE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SEE NOW I WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. YES -- THIS. RACE. JUST A THOUGHT AND I DIDN'T -- SPEAK WITH THE AUTHOR BEFORE BUT IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED PLAN. HE HAS THIS CONCEPT OF WILLFUL MISCONDUCT. A PERHAPS SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD BE A PRIME APHASIA CASE OF WILLFUL MISCONDUCT. IF -- CAL FIRE WERE TO SAY THAT -- SOMETHING NEEDED TO BE FIXED AND IT WASN'T FIXED AND THEN WE HAVE A FIRE CAUSED BY IT JUST A THOUGHT AS WE MOVE FORWARD CRESCENTA. MURATSUCHI THANK YOU. SEVEN DOT THANK YOU FOR THIS BILL I WILL BE. INCLUDES YES STICK WITH SUPPORTING THIS BILL I REMEMBER WE STARTED THIS YEAR WITH THE HEARING WITH THE THE CHAIRMAN OF THE THE PC AND GUIDE AND FOLLOWED A FRONT PAGE LA TIMES ARTICLE -- THAT WAS VERY CRITICAL OF THE NPCS. THE HISTORICAL LACK OF OVERSIGHT IN TERMS OF THESE WILDFIRE AND MITIGATION EFFORTS -- AND SO -- I I I I LIKE YOUR IDEA ABOUT HOW. YOU'RE NOT RELYING ON THE PCB GOING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION TO CONDUCT THESE AUDITS -- MIGHT MY QUESTION IS -- IN. I I KNOW THE REPRESENTATION IS MADE THAT -- THE EXPECTATION WOULD BE THAT THE PC WOULD BE WOULD TAKE ANY NOTIFICATION SERIOUSLY -- BUT YOU KNOW IS IS THERE ANY CONCERN THAT. THAT PERHAPS WE SHOULD GO FURTHER LIKE LIKE A MAKING SURE THAT THESE NOT FORGET NOTIFICATIONS ARE ALSO FILED WITH. WHAT WITH WITH THE -- WITH THE LEGISLATURE -- ADD PERHAPS AN ANNUAL REPORT OR THE DID YOU FEEL THAT THAT DE REPORTED THE PC BE SUFFICIENT. TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THEY'RE SUFFICIENT PUBLIC OVERSIGHT. OVER THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. ASSEMBLYMEMBER COMPARED TO WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW I THINK THIS GOES A LONG WAY. BUT THAT'S AN IDEA THAT -- IT'S TIME MAY COME. YEAH DEPENDING UPON THE TRANSPARENCY OF THE CITY OF THIS THE CPC ON YEAH AND AND HOW HOW THAT ENDS UP WORKING. BUT FOR NOW I DO BELIEVE THIS IS -- YOUR GREAT STEP -- IN. IN JUST MAKING SURE THAT -- YEAH WE'RE NOT ALLOWING THE UTILITIES TO SELF CERTIFY. THAT THEY'VE DONE THE WORK THAT HAS NOT WORKED WELL FOR US. I THANK YOU [inaudible] DR. I THINK YOU THINK YOU CENTER FOR BRING THIS FOR TODAY YEAH I THINK. THE IN THE GOAL WAS IN A STRUGGLE WITH WE'RE LIVING IN UNPRECEDENTED TIMES WERE THE LANDSCAPE IS CONSTANTLY SHIFTING. AND THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE OUR OUR FINGERS ON THAT SO WE CAN SHIP ALONG WITH IT AND I THINK THE OLD MODELS OF THE UTILITIES KIND OF MONITORING THEMSELVES. WE HAVE CERTAINLY COME TO UNDERSTAND. THE DON'T WORK ANYMORE THEY MAY WORK AT ONE TIME BUT THEY CERTAINLY DON'T WORK ANYMORE AND GOING FORWARD I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE. AS MANY EYES AS WE CAN -- ANYTHING DEPARTMENT FORCED IT THEY'RE OUT THERE ALREADY CAL FARTHER OUT THERE ALREADY -- AND SO THAT MAKES IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE SO I ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY THANK YOU. FOR TURNED OUT WE APPRECIATE AS THE COMMITTEE IS INDICATED YOUR BRING THE BILL FORD VERY TIMELY VERY APPROPRIATE WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS ABOUT. CREATING A GREATER DEGREE OF ACCOUNTABILITY GETTING MORE BOOTS ON THE GROUND PROTECTING THE SAFETY OF THE WORKERS AND SO -- THIS IS A ENJOYS A TO PASS AS AMENDED -- TO NATURAL RESOURCES. WE DO HAVE A MOTION HAS BEEN SECONDED IF YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE A CLOSING STATEMENT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE. SEVERAL CALL ON THE MOTION. THE MODE.

BEGINS ONE NEXT WEEK ON JULY THE THIRD IN THE FOLLOWING WEEK ON JULY THE TENT. AND THEN THAT'S A WRAP SENATOR WILL -- HERE YOUR BILL WELL YOU'RE. READY TO PRESENT [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. HOW WE'RE HERE? TO HEAR YOUR PRESENTATION SENATE BILL. FIVE FIFTEEN GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. SO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY HERE TODAY. IN THE LAST TWO YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS HAD THE MOST DEADLY AND COSTLY FIRES IN THE STATE'S HISTORY. CLIMATE EXPERTS AGREE THAT WE CAN EXPECT MORE DEVASTATING EXTREME WILDFIRES FIRES AND DROUGHTS ALL OF WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO FOREST DIE OFFS. THAT'S WHY I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT. FIVE ONE FIVE AND NARROWLY FOCUSED BILL THAT WOULD EXPAND THE DEFINITION OF HIGH HAZARD FUEL FOR BIOMASS FACILITIES WITH BIRAM CONTRACTS. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THEN GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN ISSUED AN EMERGENCY PROCLAMATION CALLING FOR THE CPUC TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF EXPIRING BIOMASS CONTRACTS. AS PART OF THE CONCERN THAT CALIFORNIA HAD AN ESTIMATED AT THAT TIME IT WAS ESTIMATED AT A HUNDRED AND TWO MILLION DEAD AND DYING TREES. CALIFORNIA PUT TOGETHER A MAP COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE HIGH HAZARD ZONES IDENTIFYING AREAS THAT COULD BE IMPACTED AS A RESULT OF A DEAD TREE HITTING A POWER LINE OR BLOCKING THE ROAD. THE CPUC RESPONDED BY REQUIRING THE UTILITIES TO PROCURE FIFTY MEGAWATTS OF BIOMASS ENERGY. THE LEGISLATURE ALSO ACTED IN PAST EIGHT FIFTY NINE SB EIGHT FIFTY NINE WHICH REQUIRED ANOTHER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MEGAWATTS OF BIOMASS ENERGY TO BE PROCURED. IN ALL THERE ARE SEVEN CONTRACTS SIGNED AS A RESULT OF THESE TWO MANDATES AND THEY REFERRED TO AS BIO RAM CONTRACTS. ALL OF THESE CONTRACTS ARE REQUIRED TO GET IS A SPECIFIED AMOUNT OF FUEL FROM HIGH HAZARD ZONES. HOWEVER THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF THIS REQUIREMENT IS THAT FOREST WASTE. THAT IS DEEMED TO BE FROM A HIGH HAZARD ZONE NOW COST MORE THAN FOREST WAIT WASTE THAT COULD START A WILDFIRE. SOME OF THESE FACILITIES PAY A PENALTY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T MEET THE REQUIREMENT OF HIGH HAZARD ZONE FUEL WHICH WAS AN ARBITRARY TARGET SET AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR. WE HAVE WE NOW KNOW WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT MILLION DEAD OR DYING TREES. AND WE HAVE AN UNHEALTHY AND OVERSTOCK FOREST WITH EXCESS FUEL A WILDFIRE CATASTROPHE IN WAITING. THE NAPA COUNTY WILDFIRES DID NOT CONTAIN THESE HIGH HAZARD ZONES AND NEITHER DID PARADISE. RATHER THAN WAIT AND TELL A DEVASTATING WILDFIRE DESTROYS A COMMUNITY BEFORE REMOVING REMOVING THE FUEL. WE WOULD LIKE TO GET OUT IN FRONT OF SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND TRY TO PREVENT THE NEXT MAJOR WILDFIRE. SB FIVE ONE FIVE EXPAND THE DEFINITION OF HIGH HAZARD ZONE FUEL TO INCLUDE THE AREAS WITHIN A WILDFIRE SINCE TWENTY TWELVE WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT CAL FIRE HAS ANNOUNCED EARLIER THIS YEAR. AS WELL AS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE CAL FIRES MAP WHICH SHOWS THESE HAZARD HAZARD ZONES. THIS BILL IS A SMALL BUT IMPORTANT STEP TO IMPROVE THE CONDITIONS IN OUR FORESTS. AND HELP PROTECT COMMUNITIES FROM WILDFIRES WHERE THERE IS EXCESS FUEL. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND MISTER CHAIR YOU AND I HAD A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE C. P. U. C. IS IN THE PROCESS OF PREPARING A REPORT -- WHICH IS THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS BILL WITH IT THAT REPORT WAS TO BE. OUT IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR AND WE EXPECTED IT. TO BE UTILIZED AS THE REPORT FOR THIS BILL BUT IT'S NOW BEEN DELAYED UNTIL JULY THIRTY FIRST AND WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THERE'S THAT A DRAFT SOMEWHERE. OUT WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE REPORT WILL SUPPORT THE STRATEGY IN THIS BILL -- SO WE WE WE'D LIKE TO KEEP THE BILL MOVING SO THAT IT'S THE VEHICLE THAT CAN IMPLEMENT -- THAT STRATEGY -- AND IF THE REPORT SAYS SOMETHING DIFFERENT THE BILL CAN BE SENT BACK TO COMMITTEE OR WE CAN MAKE WHATEVER CHANGES WE NEED IN THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ASSUMING IT GETS THAT FAR. I APPRECIATE THE MOVE THIS IMPORTANT VEHICLE. THANK YOU. I I DO I DO APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE WE SUPPORT WHAT THE BILL IS TRYING TO DO BUT RECOGNIZING THAT THE STUDY WAS OUT THERE AND I THINK WE'RE ANTICIPATING THAT IT. SHOULD BE. THE BILL OF MATERIALIZE IF NOT WE'RE TODAY RIGHT SO WE'RE WE'RE ALSO. LOOKING FOR CPUC AND PGA ANY. TO UNDERSTAND THE COMMITTEE IS EXPECTING THAT THE REPORT WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BUT CERTAINLY BEFORE -- THE END OF A PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW YOUR BILL TO BE PROPERLY -- EVALUATED AGAINST IT BUT I THINK ALL ALL INDICATIONS AS YOU SAID THE CONFORM AND IT SHOULD BE FINE BUT WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. OF THAT IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS OTHER WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT IT BUT WE'RE WE'RE IN SYNC WITH THE GREAT. THANK -- HITTING FOR OTHERS TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. LET ME START BY SAYING THE CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION -- APPRECIATES THE AUTHOR AND THE CHAIR -- AND THE DISCUSSION YOU'VE JUST HAD AROUND THE YEAR REPORT THAT WE'RE ANTICIPATING FOR THE UC AND BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THAT THIS COMMITTEE WITH THE AUTHOR. AT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THIS BILL ALIGNS WITH THE THAT THAT REPORT -- THAT SEEMS TO MAKE THE MOST SENSE. I JUST WANT TO COMMENT BRIEFLY ON WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND DOESN'T DO -- ONE THIS BILL DOES NOT -- ALTER ANY EXISTING UTILITY PURCHASE CONTRACT -- IT DOESN'T ALTER ANY THE RULES FOR FOR TIMBER HARVESTER CHANGER ANY OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL RULES. WHAT IT DOES IS IT ALLOWS US? AND TO RECOGNIZE THAT ARE FORCED MANAGEMENT GOALS ARE EVOLVING -- NGUYEN SB EIGHT FIFTY NINE WAS ADOPTED ARE FORCED ISSUES WITH THE DEAD AND DYING TREES IN THE CENTRAL SIERRA -- TODAY OUR ISSUES ARE NOT ONLY THOSE TREES. BUT EFFORTS THAT WE NEED TO DO TO FOR FIRE PREVENTION AND AND THE REMOVAL OF TREES -- IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE THAT OUR FORCES ARE HEALTHY -- AND CAN RESIST FIRE -- SO BY EXPANDING -- THE DEFINITION OF AYE HAZARD TO INCLUDE THOSE AREAS WHERE TREES ARE STILL LIVING. BUT THOSE TREES ARE DESIGNATED IN A HIGH VERY HIGH HAZARD ZONE -- FOR PUBLIC SAFETY AT THAT THOSE WILL COUNTY IN THESE BIRAM CONTRACTS -- I THINK IT'S A FAIRLY SIMPLE BILL -- BUT AGAIN NOT IMPACTING EXISTING CONTRACTS -- BUT IT ALLOWS US TO PREPARE TO MEET OUR FIRE PREVENTION GOALS MOVING FORWARD. BUT ASTRONOMICAL THANK YOU AND RICH GORDON FORMER MEMBER I SHOULD OF PROPERLY INTRODUCED -- SENATOR I KNOW IT IT'S YOU IT'S CLEAR IN OUR CONVERSATION THE INTENT OF WHAT WE WANT TO ACCOMPLISH HERE AND HAVE IT. DONE FOR A QUICKLY AND WE BELIEVE THE REPORT IS IMMINENT BUT THE REPORT HAS A AN AMENDMENT SO WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE. ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE. THE THE REPORT JUST HAS A DATE IN HERE THAT IS. PROBLEMATIC SAWFLY GET REAL QUICK MEDIC. AN EMAIL FROM THE C. P. U. C.. BOB TODAY AT OUR OFFICE. ASKING WHETHER THE MENTION IN THE REPORT OF A JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY DATE. EXTENDED THE TIME PERIOD FOR THAT PER PERFORATION OF THE REPORT. OUR ANSWER TO THEM WAS AND EQUIP EQUIPMENT CLEAN NO THAT'S BUT THERE WAS AT LEAST THAT MISUNDERSTANDING OR THAT READING OF THE OF THE OF THE ANALYSIS AND SO I JUST WANT TO PUT IT OUT THERE THAT -- IS NOT OUR INTENTION TO SEE THAT I DIDN'T BELIEVE SO AND I'M NOT SURE WHERE THAT DATE. CAME FROM AND SO WOULD PROBABLY BE BEST JUST TO STRIKE THE DAY WELL IT'S MORE OF A TECHNICAL. ISSUES SO THAT WE JUST MAKE SURE THAT THINGS LINE UP FOR PROBABLY BUT WE IT IS WHERE WERE MOVING THE BILL FORWARD BECAUSE IT NEEDS TO MOVE IT NEEDS TO GET TO THE NEXT COMMITTEE AND WERE -- ANTICIPATING -- THAT THE THAT THE STUDY WILL BE IN OUR HANDS HERE SHORTLY SO THAT WE CAN. EVALUATE IT BUT IT'S NOT OUR INTENT TO SEE THIS -- DRAG ON WE WANT TO MAKE SURE TO MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS AS WELL THAT THE BILL THOSE FOR THIS THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT. SO IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT I DID YES. YES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WAS WAITING FOR YOU SAY OKAY NOW -- OKAY NOW -- JULIE MOUNT ASK ABOUT THE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA BIOMASS ENERGY ALLIANCE. WELL THIS BILL WOULD BE HELPFUL TO THE FACILITIES THEMSELVES WE ARE ACTUALLY HERE TODAY SUPPORTING THE BILL BECAUSE IT HELPS THE COMMUNITIES THAT WERE TAKING FUEL FROM -- WE'RE AT ELEVEN ON THE GROUND WITH BIO RAM CONTRACTS FOR AROUND TWO YEARS NOW WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM THE COMMUNITIES ARE PART OF MY COMMUNITY IS A HIGH HAZARD ZONE PARTY MIGHT COMMUNITIES OF HI FIRE SEVERITY ZONE. BUT WE CAN ONLY TAKE THIS TYPE OF MATERIAL CAN'T TAKE THIS TYPE OF MATERIAL THIS BILL WILL GO A LONG WAY TO RESOLVING THOSE CONFLICTS FOR THESE ROLE AND AT RISK COMMUNITIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS GOT WHICH ON BEHALF OF THE JOINT LABOR MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE THE FOREST PRODUCTS INDUSTRY WHICH ARE. CARPENTERS MACHINISTS WOULD WORKERS WOULDN'T POPE WORKERS ABOUT TEN DIFFERENT UNIONS IN THE WOOD PRODUCTS INDUSTRY. AND ALSO ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES. BILLS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT NOT JUST ON THE FORESTRY SIDE WE IF WE'RE GONNA ENCOURAGE THINNING IN THESE ZONES WE NEED TO HAVE A PLACE TO PUT THE FUEL -- ON THE UTILITY SIDE YOU KNOW THE UTILITIES NEED A PLACE TO PUT THIS FUEL OTHER THAN JUST BURNING IT OR LETTING IT DECAY IN PILES. AFTER THEY REMOVED AROUND THE LINES -- I WOULD HOPE THAT AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD AND YOU ALL GET YOUR ARMS AROUND YOU KNOW WHAT THE FIRE PACKAGE IS GONNA LOOK LIKE -- BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR THAT YOU CONSIDER ACTUALLY EXPANDING THIS BILL TOUCHES HIGH FIRE RISK ZONES. VIC NOT JUST VERY HIGH FIRESTONE'S BUT ALSO HI FIRE RISK SONS. CERTAINLY ALL OF YOU REPRESENT COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE HIGH FIRE RISKS -- OWNS -- SO WE WOULD URGE YOU TO CONSIDER THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I WILL HERE JUST -- ADD ONS TO SUPPORT. SURE JOHN KENNEDY WITH RC RC ON BEHALF OF THE ROLE COUNTIES ASSOCIATE IN MY COMMENTS WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN MADE THESE FACILITIES ARE ABSOLUTELY VITAL. FOR FIRE RISK REDUCTION IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND WE APPRECIATE THE FLEXIBILITY THE BILL IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON -- CHEN MEMBERS DEREK OFTEN HAVE LEE CALIFORNIA CITIES IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON TO REMEMBERS VINCENT WHAT MODEL WITH THE WHITE IN A GROUP ON BEHALF OF I TRY POWER SERVICES AND SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS CHRIS MAKAYLA ON BEHALF OF HUMBOLDT MENDOCINO REDWOOD COMPANIES ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. ELLERY NEAR FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. JULIE HALL WITH SO STATION CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE HERE TO SPEAK OR TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SEEING NONE I WILL TURN BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM. MEMBERS DR. I JUST A COMMENT THAT JUST THANK YOU FOR THE SPELL I WAS UP IN UP IN THE HIGH SIERRAS TO TWO WEEKS AGO AND DISMOUNTED TREE STILL PILED UP IN MASSIVE PILES THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE JUST HEADING TO BE BURNED OR JUST TO QUE RIGHT THERE. IS INCREDIBLE -- AND TO BE ABLE TO NOT GET CAUGHT UP IN THE DETAILS OF WHICH ZONE IN WHICH SIZE TREE BUT TO BE ABLE TO SAY WE HAVE A PROBLEM THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS. AND WHILE WE ALL WANT TO MOVE AT SOME POINT TO HOW 2% LECTURE VACATION WE ARE NOWHERE NEAR THAT YET AND WE CONTINUE TO HAVE AN ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO DEAL WITH. AS A GROUP FOR DIVORCE WASTE AND THEN ALSO AG WASTE MEANT AND AND IF WE CAN'T KEEP THAT BY MUST FACILITIES RUNNING AND THEN WE DON'T HAVE THE SET THE THE CAPACITY WHEN FIRES COME TO BE ABLE TO PULL THE TREES OUT AND DO SOMETHING WITH IT SO IT'S A BIG. COMPREHENSIVE ISSUE AND I'M GLAD YOU'RE WORKING ON THINK YOU'RE MUCH. THANK YOU SQUARE SEARCHING -- SERVER I'M NOT. UP -- LOOKING AT THE THE LETTER OF OPPOSITION FROM THE SIERRA CLUB IN THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY AND AND THEY'RE THEY'RE MAKING THE ARGUMENT THAT [inaudible] TO WHILE THE THE THEY HAVE A POLLUTION I AM QUOTING FROM THEIR LETTER THE HEAVY POLLUTION A HIGH COST OF THE BY MASS INTO INCINERATORS WERE JUSTIFIED BY A PERCEIVED NEED TO REMOVE AND DISPOSE OF TREES THAT POSE A HIGH RISK TO COMMUNITIES -- BUT THEY THEY MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT BASED ON THE ECONOMICS OF BY MASS. INCINERATION THAT. TO THAT -- THE THE TREES WOULD ONLY BE TAKEN FROM THE CHEAPEST THERE IS NOT THERE IS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS THE HIGHEST. FIRE RISK COULD YOU RESPOND TO THOSE -- ARGUMENTS. THANKS FOR THE QUESTION REALLY APPRECIATED VERY MUCH THAT THE THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS TO INCLUDE -- BIO MAT MASS WASTE MATERIAL THAT IS -- THAT IS A HAZARD TO COMMUNITIES AND SO IT'S NOT THAT IT'S CHEAPER IT'S THAT IT IT IS -- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ISSUES ONE IS SOME OF IT IS JUST LYING AROUND AND IT IS -- IT'S A DANGER TO THE COMMUNITY FRANKLY THE WAY IT'S BEING DISPOSED OF RIGHT NOW IS TO LET IT BIO DEGRADE WHICH IS -- EMITTING A LOT OF CARBON -- THE DECOMPOSITION RELEASES CARBON AND AND IS NOT GOOD BUT BUT EVEN MORE DANGEROUS IS THAT BECAUSE IT IS FUEL IF IT LIGHTS UP. IT -- THE POLLUTION THAT'S CREATED BY THE BURNING MATERIAL IS -- EVEN WORSE AT IT APART FROMTHE FACT THAT WOULD THEN EVERYBODY BREATHE BREATHE IT IN RIGHT NOW WHAT'S HAPPENING IN MANY OF OUR OUR REGIONS IS THAT -- IN PARTICULAR AGRICULTURAL WASTE IS BURNT IT'S JUST BURNED IN THE FEEL THERE'S NO PLACE TO PUT IT AND THERE'S IT'S IT YOU'RE NOT GENERATING ANY ENERGY. WHEN YOU'RE BURNING WASTE IN A IN THE MIDDLE OF AN AGRICULTURAL FIELDS YOU MIGHT AS WELL TAKE IT TO A BIO MASS FACILITY? BURN IT CLEANLY. AND AND AND THEY'VE ALL BEEN IT RETROFITTED WITH THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF OF THEIR THEIR SCRUBBERS THAT THAT CLEAN THAT THE BY PRODUCT AND SO -- THIS WILL NOT ALLOW. CHEAPER MATERIAL. THAT IS NOT A DANGER TO THE COMMUNITY TO BE UTILIZED THIS IS THIS IS MATERIAL THAT IS CREATING A HUGE PUBLIC SAFETY CRISIS AND AND WE'VE VERY CAREFULLY THAT THE THE BILL WAS ACTUALLY BIGGER WE THINK IT SHOULD BE BAKER -- WE'VE NARROWLY TAILORED IT AT THE REQUEST OF SENATE COMMITTEES -- TO REALLY FOCUS ON THE HIGHEST NEED AREA BUT I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF THE REPORT THAT COMES OUT FROM THE C. P. U. C. SAYS WE NEED TO BROADEN IT A LITTLE BIT -- BECAUSE WE HAVE A ON DOES NOT A VERY SPECIFIC LEGAL TERM BUT WE HAVE A TON OF MATERIAL OUT THERE THAT NEEDS TO BE DISPOSED OF AND THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GONNA GET RID OF IT IS IF WE CAN WE WE HAVE A USE -- AND WE CAN WE CAN MOVE IT -- QUICKLY AND USE AND USE IT TO CREATE ENERGY. SO I I I FUNDAMENTALLY DISAGREE WITH WITH WITH THAT PREMISE IN THAT BUT BUT LET ME ALSO SAY THAT I HAD EARLY CONVERSATION WHEN I GOT TO THE ASSEMBLY -- TWO YEARS AGO AND I ASKED THE SIERRA CLUB WHAT'S YOUR SOLUTION TO THE HUNDRED AND TWO DEAD OR DYING TREES AND BASICALLY WHAT THEY TELL ME IS LEAVE IT. LEAVE IT ON THE GROUND AND I WAS APPALLED BECAUSE DECOMPOSITION IS NOT THE SOLUTION -- FOR FOR THIS THIS MATERIAL AND WE'VE SEEN THAT WITH THE THE CHALLENGES WITH CLIMATE CHANGE THAT ARE FIRES ARE BURNING HOTTER THEY'RE THEY'RE MOVING A LOT FASTER. AND THIS MATERIAL LAYING AROUND OR AND A LOT OF IT IS IS. IT IT'S PEOPLE REALLY DO NEED TO GO UP INTO THE HIGH SIERRAS AND SEE THE DEAD TREES UP THERE IT'S APPALLING. WE NEED TO WE NEED TO TAKE THOSE TREES OUT WE NEED TO GET RID OF THEM AND WE NEED TO RE PLANNING ON THE WAY YOU DO THAT IS IF YOU'VE GOT A A WAY TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THE FUEL THAT CREATES. THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT SO I I DISAGREE WITH THAT THERE THERE IS STATEMENT OKAY. I MEAN THAT THAT MAY BE THE BOTTOM LINE THE THAT. TO YOU DO YOU DISAGREE WITH WITH THEIR STATEMENTS I YOU KNOW I I IT DID HAVE THE BENEFIT ARE GOING UP IN THE HIGH SIERRAS -- WITH WITH THE TOUR THEREFORE SHE ASSOCIATION THAT WAS LED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER -- RECENTLY AND IN A WHILE I AGREE COMPLETE WITH WITH YOU KNOW EVERYTHING THAT YOU'RE SAYING IT JUST MAKES COMMON SENSE THAT IF YOU WANT TO FIGHT THE THE WITH THE WILD FIRES. WE NEED TO CLEAR OUT THE FUEL ARM AND AND AND WE NEED TO PROVIDE THE YOU KNOW MARKET AND OTHER INCENTIVES TO A TO DECLARE THAT FUEL. IT JUST BOTHERS ME THAT -- YOU KNOW. I MEAN. YOU KNOW I AND AGAIN I'M QUOTING FROM THE SIERRA CLUB AND AND A CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY LETTER HERE THAT -- THEY'RE CLAIMING THAT THAT THE THE PROGRAM THE BIRAM PROGRAM HAS JUST IS NOT FILLED ITS. ITS PURPOSE OF HELPING THE REMOVING UTILIZE TREES THAT POSE HAZARDS -- SO YEAH IT LOOKS LIKE A MAYBE I NEED TO HAVE I I WISH THE SIERRA CLUB HERE TO ADDRESS THIS BUT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE NOT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OCTOBER. WELL I I DON'T BELIEVE THERE LETTER -- COULD YOU MAKE ME CO AUTHOR. I WELL YES IF YOU READ THEIR LETTER. IT SAYS -- WELL WE SHOULD ONLY BE WORRIED ABOUT TREES THAT ARE NEAR HOMES HAVEN'T THEY SEEN PARADISE PARADISE. WHEN UP WHEN MILES AWAY A FIRE STARTED AND THEN IT WASN'T SO MUCH THAT THE FIRE WENT THROUGH PARADISE IT'S THAT THE BURNING EMBERS WERE BLOWN BY HUNDRED MILE AN HOUR WINDS? I SHOULD NEVER BEEN BELT. FRANKLY IT SHOULD NEVER BE REBUILT. FROM THE EIGHTIES THEY KNEW THAT WAS GOING TO BE DISASTER BUT AT ANY RATE. THAT'S A SEPARATE SUBJECT THE POINT IS THE FIRE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO BE NEAR YOUR HOUSE TO BURN IT DOWN. THE EMBERS COMING IN THESE HIGH WINDS CAN BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN YOU CAN CLEAR EVERY TREE AND IN FACT IF YOU GO THROUGH PARADISE THEIR PLACES WHERE THE TREES ARE THERE BUT THE HOUSES BURNED DOWN. SO -- THIS LETTER IS -- IT MISSES THE POINT. OTHER THAN THAT IS JUST FINE I HAVE ONE QUESTION -- I DO HAVE ONE OTHER QUESTION WHICH IS SO ARE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER DOLLY BEFORE I WENT ON TO THE SENATE. HE WAS ALWAYS PRESSING US TO DO MORE OF THIS IN THE BILL SEMINAR THAT WOULD GET OUT OF HERE BUT THEY DIE SOMEWHERE ELSE. THANK GOD WE'VE. WELL WE DIDN'T LISTEN TO HIM SOON ENOUGH BUT AT LEAST WE'RE DOING IT NOW. MY CONCERN IS THOUGH A LOT OF THESE PLANTS HAVE SHUT DOWN. THE CCA'S ARE PROBABLY NOT GOING -- TO CONTRACT WITH THEM FOR ELECTRICITY AND AND P. GENIE IS MAYBE. THEY ALWAYS USED TO BE THE ONE OF CONTRACTED BUT THEY'VE LOST MOST OF THEIR CUSTOMERS. HOW WE GOING TO ACTUALLY -- BRING SOME OF THESE PLANTS BACK BECAUSE THERE'S INADEQUATE CAPACITY GIVEN THAT THESE SHUT DOWN AND HOW WE WERE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET ELECTRICAL CONTRACTS. GEN TWO WEB ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THE WITHIN A MEETING YESTERDAY IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE JUST ON THIS TOPIC -- TERMS OF THE YOU KNOW WHAT DO WE DO MOVING FORWARD LAST YEAR IN THE IN SB NOT A ONE THE LEGISLATURE DID EXTEND -- CONTRACTS -- FOR BIRAM BUT FOR FIVE YEARS -- BUT YOU NEED A LONG TERM CONTRACT COMMITMENT -- AND OUR FORCE MANAGEMENT ISSUES ARE GOING TO BE LONG TERM. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING GOING TO SOLVE ANY YEAR -- TO THIS IS A LONG TERM PROJECT BECAUSE WE'VE WE'VE GOT TO THIS SITUATION -- OVER CENTURY -- IN TERMS OF THE ARE FORCE MANAGEMENT STYLE -- SO -- WE'D WILL NEED TO LOOK AT YOU LONGER TERM CONTRACTS -- EXTENDING IT ADDITIONAL -- RESOURCES TO HELP MOVE FORWARD ADDITIONAL -- FACILITIES AND AND TO MAINTAIN FACILITIES WE HAVE A MANY OF THESE FACILITIES -- YOU KNOW OPERATE ON A VERY THIN MARGIN YEAH AND I THINK -- AS IT RELATES TO THE CCA'S -- YOU KNOW IT WOULD THEIR DO NEED TO BE CONVERSATION BECAUSE THIS IS A RENEWABLE ENERGY -- IN THE YOU KNOW NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT I THINK. SO THIS IS CLEARLY A PROJECT FOR ANOTHER DAY BUT IT'S ONE THAT. I'D BE GLAD TO START THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] WITH REST. I WASN'T GOING TO ADD ANYTHING BUT I THINK THAT I DO WANT TO RESPOND I THINK. WHEN THE SIERRA CLUB DOES PROVIDE THEIR INPUT IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THERE ARE ONE OF THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT? AND I THINK THEIR INPUT. FOR ME ESPECIALLY IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT I THINK THAT -- THE AUTHOR HAS CONSIDERED THAT A BIO MOUSE -- THIS ISN'T IT. THE CLEANEST WAYS TO TO GET ENERGY THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE SO EVERYTHING THAT IS BEING SAID BY THIS YEAR CLUB IS ACCURATE. I THINK THAT WE ARE IN VERY DIFFICULT TIMES -- IT IT ISN'T UNTIL LAST YEAR THAT I WOULD EVEN CONSIDER BIOMASS QUITE FRANKLY. AND WE HAD THE THE CONVERSATION LAST YEAR. BUT I THINK THAT THESE ARE EXTRAORDINARY TIMES SO WE DO HAVE TO LOOK AT SOMETHING BEYOND WHAT WE'VE LOOKED AT BEFORE. BUT EVEN HAVING SAID THAT I I SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE INPUT FROM SIERRA CLUB BECAUSE THESE ARE. WHAT THEY SUGGESTED WHAT THEY TELL US ARE ARE THE VERY THINGS WE NEED TO CONSIDER WHEN WE'RE MAKING DECISIONS WE CANNOT? WE CANNOT JUST THINK OF ONE AREA SAY THIS IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT AND THAT'S THE END OF IT WE NEED TO HAVE THOSE WHO SPEAK AGAINST. A PARTICULAR PATH SO THAT WE CAN THEN THINK THROUGH EXACTLY WHAT IT IS WE WANT TO DO AND IF NEED BE THEN RETHINK AT THE WE THINK IT THROUGH. SO THAT WEEK ALWAYS LOOK FOR THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE TO GET TO WHERE WE WANT. DURING THEIR THESE EXTRAORDINARY TIMES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR POINT WELL TAKEN. IT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- I'VE WRITTEN IT MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY HAVE A CONVERSATION -- AND I I AM. I THINK THE CHALLENGES IS THESE THESE ARE DIFFICULT TIMES -- AND AS WE LOOK AT OUR ENERGY PRODUCTION -- WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO THINK A LITTLE BIT OUTSIDE THE BOX AT TIMES BECAUSE THE POSSIBILITY OF WILDFIRES CAUSED BY ELECTRICAL LINES MEANS WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL WERE PUTTING THOSE ELECTRICAL LINES. AND AND AND AS WE LOOK AT THAT WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ENERGY WHEN WE NEED IT -- SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE ROLLING BLACKOUTS SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE -- ENERGY SHORTAGES -- AND SO THAT WE HAVE AN AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO PICK THE CLEANEST IN THAT AND THE BEST USE OF OF A OF A OF A OF THE TOOLS IN ONE OF THE TOOLS. UNFORTUNATELY IS IS DEAD AND DYING TREES ISSUE -- WE NEED A CLEAR AND WE NEED TO CLEAN THAT UP AND AND THAT'S THE REASON THAT I'M HERE TODAY TO WHAT I WISH THAT THEY THAT THOSE TREES WERE WERE NOT THERE ABSOLUTELY -- BECAUSE WEEK THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO TO GET ENERGY AND AND WE'RE WE'RE WORKING ON THAT BUT BUT THIS IS A A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE IN RURAL CALIFORNIA. IT'S A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE FOR OUR ENTIRE STATE BECAUSE IT'S THE TOURIST SEASON AND PEOPLE ARE TRAVELING AND THEY'RE VISITING MANY OF THESE COMMUNITIES. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE SAFE WHEN THEY'RE THERE AND SO THAT WE CAN CLEAR WHAT -- WHAT WHAT HAS BEEN DETERMINED BY CAL FIRE TO BE HIGH HAZARD -- IF YOU WILL AND SO THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK AND AND DISCUSS -- WAYS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO TO GET RID OF THIS FUEL AND AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE -- PROTECTING THE PUBLIC SO I THINK YOU FOR FOR FOR YOUR ATTENTION TODAY AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

SENATOR BRADFORD IS OUR GLASS AUTHOR FOR THE DAY WE HAVE -- HAS BE ONE FIFTY FIVE WHICH WILL HEAR FROM YOU FIRST ON AND THEN SENATE BILL. TWO FIFTY FIVE WELCOME THANK YOU. THE BILL THANK YOU. I CHECKED LAST RIVAL. ROBOT WITH THAT IF -- ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT WELL IT'S JUST SIMPLY AS BE ONE FIVE FIVE SIMPLY -- MEASURES. AND IMPROVED TO EXISTING -- STATING YOU PROGRAMS INCREASING ACCOUNTABILITY AND BOTH BOTH THE R. P. R. P. S. AND I. R. P.. AND WE ALL KNOW ABOUT RELIABILITY IN THIS BILL HELPS US GET THERE SO I HAVE TO WITNESSES IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO ADD SOMETHING WE HAVE -- SCOTT WHICH WHAT'S IN CALIFORNIA I'M A WITH THE ALICIA FOR CALIFORNIA UTILITIES AND WE HAVE CALLING A CUSHY FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WELCOME MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOT WHICH ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES THIS IS A VERY SIMPLE. BILL THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED TWO VERY IMPORTANT PIECES OF POLICY ONE WAS THE OUR PS WHICH YOU'VE INCREASED. THREE TIMES -- IN RECENT YEARS AND TO THE REQUIREMENT IN SB THREE FIFTY THAT ALL RETAIL SELLERS -- PUT TOGETHER AN INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN. ALL THIS BILL SIMPLY DOES IS MAKE SURE THAT. THE P. YOU SEE ENFORCES THE LAWS THAT YOU ALL PASSED. AND THE FIRST PROVISION WHICH REQUIRES THAT THEY REVIEW ALL RETAIL SELLERS -- ANNUAL COMPLIANCE REPORTS WITH THE OUR PS AND IF THE CPUC FLAGS A PATTERN THAT. CONCERNS THEM THAT PERHAPS. AND I OWE YOU OR E. S. P. OR CCA IS NOT ON TRACK TO MEET THEIR COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS. THAT THEY SIMPLY MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THEM AS TO WHAT THEY SHOULD DO IN ORDER TO COMPLY. SO FOR ANYBODY TO COME UP WITH OPPOSE THIS BILL TODAY THEY'RE OPPOSING IT FOR ONE REASON AND ONE REASON ONLY AND THAT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO CPUC TO SAY THAT THE EMPEROR HAS NO CLOTHES. AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF NAKED EMPERORS OUT THERE SO WE'D VIRGIN I'VE A VERY COLORFUL. YEAH. HELLO COMMITTEE UP MY NAME'S CAUCUS NAY ON THE VICE PRESIDENT'S ON CALIFORNIA'S AND RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR POWER SUPPLY OPERATIONS APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB -- ONE FIFTY FIVE AS YOU ALL KNOW. CALIFORNIA HAS A VERY -- A DISHES -- AGREEMENT A CLEAN ENERGY GOAL 60% OUR PS BY TWENTY THIRTY AND A 100% CLEAN ENERGY BY. TWENTY FORTY FIVE IN ORDER TO GET THERE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR ELECTRIC SYSTEM IS RELIABLY PLAN -- FOR AND THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE THAT EACH LOAD SERVING ANTI -- BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO DO IT'S IT'S PRO RATA SHARE OF THE RELIABILITY AND CLEAN ENERGY THAT -- IS GOING TO BE NEEDED TO IT TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS. SB ONE FIFTY FIVE MAKES CLEAR. THAT THE CPC IS THAT ENTITY THAT WILL PROVIDE CENTRAL PLANNING AND OVERSIGHT TO ENSURE THAT ALL ELLIS THESE MEET THEIR RID CLEAN ENERGY AND THE LIABILITY GOALS. OF THE ELECTRIC GRID IS A VERY COMPLICATED -- DYNAMIC SYSTEM AND IT IT WOULD BE -- QUITE FRANKLY -- VERY DAMAGING TO OUR ECONOMIC SUCCESS AS A STATE IF WE ALLOW CERTAIN LOAD SERVING ENTITIES TO NOT HAVE TO PARTICIPATE IN A COLLECTIVE PLANNING PROCESS TO ENSURE THE GREATEST RELIABLE. OF WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHICH IS VERY WELL INTENDED LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT SITUATED -- TO BE A STATEWIDE ENERGY GRID PLANNER. LIKEWISE WITH ENERGY SERVICE PROVIDERS THEIR THEIR MOTIVE UNDERSTANDABLY IS TO PROVIDE POWER AT THE LOWEST POSSIBLE COST TO THEIR CUSTOMERS. AND THEY'RE GONNA WANT TO MEET THEIR RELIABILITY AND THEIR CLEAN ENERGY GOALS AT THE LOWEST POSSIBLE COST BUT THE LOWEST POSSIBLE COST MAY NOT ACTUALLY ENSURE RELIABILITY. BECAUSE OF THE INTERMITTENT HR OF RENEWABLE ENERGY. ON SOLD ONLY PRODUCES WHEN THE SUN SHINES WIND ONLY PRODUCES WHEN THE WIND BLOWS. OUR HYDRO IS ONLY AS GOOD AS THE PRECIPITATION THAT WE GET THAT YEAR. WE NEED TO CAREFULLY AND AND AND AND VERY THOUGHTFULLY PLANNED HOW TO BRING ALL THESE RESOURCES TOGETHER WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A AND THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE ALL LOAD SERVING EIGHTIES TO SUBJECT THEMSELVES TO A A CENTRAL OVERSIGHT -- TO MAKE SURE WE GET THERE SO WITH THAT IN MIND I I URGE YOU ALL -- TO TO VOTE I ON SB ONE FIFTY FIVE AND I WILL STATE YOUR PRESENT QUESTIONS. PROJECT THAT THERE ANYONE HERE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE BILL YES MELISSA CORTES ROTH ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA WIND ENERGY ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. HUNTER STERN AYE BE DEBBIE TWELVE FORTY FIVE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. I DO WE HAVE ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. HI MY NAME IS ALLISON BROWN I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THREE FIFTY AREA ACTION SAN DIEGO THREE FIFTY SOUTH A LOS ANGELES THREE FIFTY CLIMATE ACTION GROUP. SO CAL THREE FIFTY CLIMATE ACTION THREE FIFTY VENTURA COUNTY CRIME AND HAVE AND THE THREE FIFTY RIVERSIDE. RESPECTFULLY ASKING FOR A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- WILL RECEIVE YOUR TESTIMONY IF YOU'D LIKE TO PRESENT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS DON GILBERT FOR CAL CCA WE OPPOSE. I WANTED TO FIRST ACTUALLY APOLOGIZED TO SENATOR BRADFORD WE THE BILL WAS SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED AND SENATE ENERGY WITH AMENDMENTS. AND THERE WAS A LITTLE CONFUSION OR MISUNDERSTANDING NOBODY'S FAULT -- ABOUT ONE PROVISION WHICH IS THE PROVISION LEFT THAT WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT TODAY AND WE THOUGHT THAT WAS OUT OF THE BILL AND SO WE HAD REMOVED OPPOSITION THAT COMMITTEE SO I'M SORRY FOR THE MISUNDERSTANDING -- SO WE HAVE TWO CONCERNS FIRST THE ONE I JUST REFERENCE WHICH IS ABOUT LANGUAGE IN THE BILL. THAT INSERTS THE WORD IN FORCE WHICH DOESN'T EXISTING CURRENT LAW IN TERMS OF THE CPC'S AUTHORITY. OVER THE I. R. P. WE WE THINK THAT -- THAT'S AN EXPANSION OF THE CDC'S SPECIFIC CUT -- WRITES A OUR POWER AND THE I. R. P. IS SUPPOSED TO BE A PLANNING DOCUMENT IT'S NOT A ROCK SOLID PROCUREMENT PLAN THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE FLEXIBILITY. TEN TWELVE YEARS OUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES COULD BE DIFFERENT YOU DON'T WANT TO BE LOCKED IN THAT COULD. CAUSE RATES TO GO UP AND OTHER PROBLEMS SO -- SO WE THINK THAT BY INSERTING THE WORD AND FORCE IT GIVES A CBC THE ABILITY. TO NULLIFY CONTRACTS AND SO ON AND THAT'S AN ABILITY THAT WE DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE WITH REGARD TO CCA'S -- THE SECOND REASON OUR SECOND CONCERN. WHICH I WHICH I THINK IS A VERY IMPORTANT CONCERN IS THE FOLLOWING. SB THREE FIFTY ESTABLISHED THIS FIRST OF A KIND STATEWIDE IRP PROCESS THAT BILL IS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN IT WAS. VERY INTENSELY NEGOTIATED INCLUDING BY THE BY THE CCA WORLD -- IT BECAME EFFECTIVE LAW OBVIOUSLY ON JANUARY ONE SIXTEEN WORD NOW IN THE MIDST ROUGHLY HALF WAY THROUGH THE FIRST STATEWIDE IRP PROCESS EVER AT THE CPUC. THIS IS AKIN TO BEING IN THE MET IN THE MIDDLE OF PENDING LITIGATION WITH A BILL COMING TO THE LEGISLATURE. TO IMPACT THE SUBJECT OF THE LITIGATION AND GENERALLY AS YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE LIKES TO HOLD OFF TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE LEGISLATURE WITH THE LITIGATION. WE THINK THAT'S THE SITUATION HERE -- WE EXPECT A AS I MENTIONED WE'RE ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH THIS EXISTING PROCEEDING BASED ON A STATUTE THAT WENT INTO LAW A FEW YEARS AGO. WE EXPECT THE FINAL A PROPOSED FINAL ORDER IN LATE TWENTY TWENTY OR EARLY TO TWENTY ONE AND A FINAL ORDER CAN BE AS EARLY AS THIRTY DAYS AFTER THAT FOR LATER. SO WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD WAIT FOR THIS FIRST I OUR P. BASED ON THE EXISTING LAW TO BE COMPLETED. I REPEAT PROCESS AND THEN BRING IN THE CPC TO AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING BRING AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS LET'S SEE WHAT WAS RIGHT AND WRONG IF THEY'RE AND CHANGES NEED TO BE MADE. BUT DON'T DO THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PRECEDING. YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE DON'T REALLY KNOW I MEAN THEY ARE THE AUTHOR MAY HAVE MAY HAVE A VALID POINT MAYBE THIS CHANGE SHOULD SHOULD SHOULD HAPPEN A LOT BUT MAYBE NOT. LET'S WAIT AND FINISH AND THEN SEE WE THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE THE PRUDENT AND FRANKLY THE RIGHT WAY TO PROCEED THANK YOU THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE. TO AT THEIR POSITION OF OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON CATHERINE BRANDENBURG REPRESENTING CINEMA CLEAN POWER LIKE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS BY MISTER GILBERT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ALICIA **** ON BEHALF OF SAN JOSE CLEAN ENERGY IN OPPOSITION. VINCENT WERE OF MUCH OF THE HALF OF EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY IN OPPOSITION. STEVE BAKER WITH THEIR NEED ASSOCIATES FOR SILICON VALLEY CLEAN ENERGY IN OPPOSITION. MARK SPENCER MAKER FOR PENINSULA CLEAN ENERGY INVALID CLEAN ENERGY IN OPPOSITION. CAROL SOMEBODY ON BEHALF OF THE CITY SELAMA BEATS LANA ENERGY LANDS. EMILY PAPPAS SOME HAVE MC IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. WILL TURN TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR THE CLERK -- SO THE WAY I READ YOUR BILL -- DEEP WELL FIRST OF ALL THE QUESTION ABOUT ENFORCE REQUIREMENT VERSUS. REQUIRES A CONDITION OF APPROVAL OR CERTIFICATION. HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THAT LANGUAGE YET NOW THAT'S THE FIRST -- HEARD THAT THAT'S A CONCERN. WHILE BE MORE APT TO EXAMINE A BETTER I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE ISSUE THAT MISTER GOVERNMENT CAN ALWAYS ISSUE IS THAT I'LL. P. C. C. H. DO NOT THANK. FAT WELL. AND YOU CAN DISAGREE WITH ME HERE THEY DO NOT THINK THAT THE P. YOU SEE HAS AUTHORITY OVER THEM. IS THAT WHAT IT COMES DOWN. TO NO WE THINK THAT THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY SET FORTH IN SB THREE FIFTY WHICH IS TO CERTIFY. R. I. R. PEAS AS OPPOSED TO A PROVE THE I. R. PEAS OF THE I. O. U.'S. AND WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT EXPANDED IN TOWER AND LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE'RE SO IN THE CURRENT EXISTING PROCEED PROCEEDING SO WHAT JUST COMPLETED A PRIZED OPPOSED TO APPROVED ME. IF IF YOU THIS GIVES ME WHAT. WHAT THE CERTIFIED SUPPOSED TO BE APPROVED MAIN? WELL HONESTLY AT THE THIS IS A VERY NEW WANTS ISSUE WHICH IS WHY IT DEPENDS WHO YOU TALK. TO YOU KNOW MISTER WEST WILL HAVE ONE VIEW WILL HAVE ANOTHER OTHERS WILL HAVE OTHERS BUT ONE THING WE DO KNOW IS THAT. THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A BILL IT'S THAT WAS IN THIS PROCESS WHERE THEY USED A DIFFERENT DESCRIPTOR OF THE RIGHTS OF THE AUTHORITY OF THE CPC OVER THE I. O. U.'S VERSES OVER THE CCA'S AND WE THINK THIS. THIS -- LANGUAGE WOULD MOVE TOWARDS WHAT. THE CPC AUTHORITY IS OVER THE I. O. USE RIGHT NOW AND AND THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE THE WAY TO GO BUT LET'S FINISH THE PROCEEDING AND IF THE AUTHOR HAS RECEIVED INFORMATION THAT THE PROCEEDINGS OVER THAT'S THAT'S AN ACCURATE INFORMATION. RIGHT SO MY CONCERN HAS ALWAYS BEEN WHEN YOU HAVE MANY SMALL ENTITIES HOW THE HECK DO YOU -- BALLOTS THE GRANT. THAT'S THE ISSUE HERE AND YOU CAN'T HAVE. YOU NO ONE SMALL CCA AND ANOTHER SMALL CCA AND ANOTHER. ONE REALLY BALANCING YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CENTRAL AUTHORITY LOOKING AT THIS. WHICH SHOULD BE THE I SO AND THEN THE OUT WITH THAT INFORMATION THE P. YOU SEE. FOR EXAMPLE IN THE LATEST -- STATEMENT OF WHERE AND WHAT THE SEE THE ARM. CCA'S WOULD DO. DAY PROCURED A WHOLE LOT OF SOLAR BECAUSE IT IS THE CHEAPEST THING AND THEY PROMISE LOWER PRICES. BUT IT'S NOT A BALANCED PORTFOLIO IT WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO WORK IN REALITY. AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT'S THE CASE AND AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE THAT CENTRAL LOOK THAT CENTRAL AUTHORITY. AND THREE FIFTY DIDN'T DETERMINE EVERYTHING I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US NOW TO LOOK AT THIS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ALL FIT [inaudible] AND IF THE IF WE DON'T. WE COULD HAVE BLACKOUTS. CONSUMER CITY. THANK YOU I WOULD AGREE WITH THE WITH -- MISTER QUIRK IN. THE NEED FOR A CENTRAL AUTHORITY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE BALANCING -- ALL OF OUR CALYCES TO TO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE NOT ALL HAVE ADEQUATE BUT RELIABLE -- ENERGY -- BUT IF IT APPEARS TO ME I AM REFERRING TO THE CAL CCA LETTER AND MISTER GILBERT I LIKE TO ASK FOR CLARIFICATION. YOUR LETTER DATED JUNE FOURTH OF OF A TWENTY NINETEEN IT IT IT PROPOSES AMENDMENTS THAT. SEEMS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. TO THAT -- THE PC SHOULD. EXECUTE THE IT'S R. P. MANDATE UNDER SB THREE FIFTY IS THAT CORRECT. YEAH THAT THAT'S CORRECT WE WE DON'T DISAGREE WITH MR QUIRK EITHER THAT SHOULD THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A CENTRAL ENTITY THAT'S TAKEN A LOOK THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS THEIR AUTHORITY. WE DON'T THINK BUT LET'S LET THIS FIRST I OUR P. STATEWIDE R. P. EVER SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THE BILL BE COMPLETED BEFORE WE DO THE LOOK BACK AND DECIDE WHAT IF ANYTHING NEEDS TO BE CHANGED IN STATUTE. THAT'S ALL WE'RE SAYING BUT WE AGREE FUNDAMENTAL WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL POINT OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK OKAY AND AND ALONG THOSE LINES. YOUR PROPOSED AMENDMENT. TO IS -- TO REQUIRE -- THE LLC'S TO TO FILE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANS AND A SCHEDULE FOR PURE AT PERIODIC UPDATES TO THE PLAN -- THAT THAT'S YOUR FIRST PROPOSED AMENDMENT. CORRECT AND AND HAS SAID AMENDED AND BEEN ACCEPTED. NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE OKAY AND THEN THE SECOND A PROPOSED AMENDMENT. IS FOR THE THAT THE PC. SHALL REQUIRE AS A CONDITION OF APPROVAL OR CERTIFICATION. THAT THE I. R. P. OF EACH LSE CONTRIBUTES TO DIVERSE IMBALANCE BEFORE PART FULL AND I I HAVE TO ADMIT. MISTER GILBERT I I I I I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN. BETWEEN SHALL ENFORCE THE REQUIREMENT AND SHALL REQUIRE AS A CONDITION OF APPROVAL OF CERTIFICATION COULD. TO ENLIGHTEN US ON THAT -- YEAH SO. FAIR QUESTION AND THAT'S WHY I SAID IT'S THE NEW ONCE ISSUE WITH THIS LANGUAGE. OUR ATTORNEYS BELIEVE THE INSERTION OF THE WORLD WORD AND FORCE [inaudible] SUBSTANTIALLY. INCREASES THE AUTHORITY OF THE CPC ON THESE ISSUES CHANGES THE AUTHORITY OVER THE CCA'S WHICH YOU KNOW ARE AFTER ALL INDEPENDENT BROKERS. AND BUT WE AGREED BUT WE UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW THE NEED FOR THIS CENTRAL BODY TAKING A LOOK. SO THE LANGUAGE WE WE PROPOSE ACCORDING TO OUR ATTORNEYS. YOU KNOW IS MORE CONSISTENT WITH SB THREE FIFTY THAT POINT YOUR YOUR MAIN CONCERN IS. AS INDICATE IN YOUR LETTER THAT -- YOUR YOUR CONCERN THAT CENTER BRADFORD'S BILL IS CONVERTING OUR PIECE FROM A PLANNING DOCUMENT TO PROCUREMENT MANDATES. YEAH I MEAN THAT THAT'S WHAT I MENTIONED IN MY TESTIMONY THAT'S A MAJOR CONCERN THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE PLANNING DOCUMENTS ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE IN CEMENT. AND AND IN FACT -- ALONG THOSE LINES I MEAN I I I NOTED THAT THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS TALKED ABOUT HOW [inaudible] THE THE ENERGY PROCUREMENT -- TODAY -- ALL IS -- IS IS VASTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE FROM DAY FROM THE GENERATION THAT WE RELIED ON A DECADE AGO AND SO THAT WOULD HIGHLIGHT YOUR CONCERN ABOUT. LOCKING OURSELVES INTO THESE LONG TERM KIND. TRAXXAS ACCURATE LOCKING IT LOCKING US INTO -- ONE PLANNING CONVERTING A PLANNING DOCUMENT TO A ROCK SOLID YOU KNOW DOCUMENT THAT THAT HAS NO FLEXIBILITY THAT WOULD BE THE CONCERNED YES. I I'D LIKE TO DID TURN -- TO THE ADDISON REPRESENTATIVE -- WE WE WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE I. R. P. SHOULD BE. YOU KNOW HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY TO ALLOW FOR FOR THE THAT THE CHANGING -- ENERGY TECHNOLOGY. YES THERE ARE PEAS ACTUALLY DO PROVIDE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF FLEXIBILITY AND GIVES A LITTLE BIT OF A A CONFUSION HERE -- UTILITY -- ARE PEAS -- WITH -- AND LONG TERM RETIREMENT PLANS HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF FLEXIBILITY IN THEM -- WHAT THE CQC DOES IS IT SETS STANDARDS THAT THE UTILITY HAS TO ME IN THIS CASE -- UNDER A SB ONE FIFTY FIVE THE EXPECTATION WOULD BE THAT THE CPC WOULD APPROVE A A RANGE OF ATTRIBUTES THAT EACH LSE NEEDS TO MEET AND LEAVE TO EACH LOC. ARE HOW TO BEST DETERMINE TO MEET THOSE ATTRIBUTES -- THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE -- JUST THIS LAST THURSDAY -- THE CPC ISSUED A RULING IDENTIFYING THAT THERE'S AT LEAST TWO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF OF CAPACITY SHORTFALL -- ANTICIPATED IN TWO YEARS BY THE SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE EDISON BUT WORKING WITH COMMISSION STAFF ON THAT OUR OWN ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT THE SHORTFALL MAYBE AS MUCH AS SEVEN OR EIGHT THOUSAND MEGAWATTS. TO PUT THAT IN CONTEXT THAT'S ABOUT 15% OF THE TOTAL DEMAND AT PEAK -- IT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE OUR WANTS TO COOLEY FACILITIES ARE RETIRING WHICH THEY SHOULD -- IT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE THE NET PEAK ON THE SYSTEM IS MOVING FROM THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER TO SEPTEMBER. WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE AS MUCH SUNSHINE IN SEPTEMBER RIGHT THE SUN GOES DOWN SOONER SO THE SOLAR -- PROJECTS THAT WE'VE BEEN INVESTING IN ARE NOT THAT EFFECTIVE IN SEPTEMBER OF THE WIND DOESN'T BLOW THAT MUCH SEPTEMBER BASICALLY YOU GET ABOUT 15% OF THE OUTPUT OF THE SOLAR AND WIND PROJECT IN SEPTEMBER SO. IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IN NEXT TWO YEARS IF WE DON'T WANT TO HELP OUR LIABILITY SITUATION LIKE WE DID DURING THE ENERGY CRISIS I'M HAPPY TO SHARE. WITH FOLKS HOW THAT CAME AMOUNT OF THAT WE HAVE ENFORCEMENT OF ALL L. THIS SEASON MEETING THEIR FAIR SHARE OF THE RELIABILITY AND CLEAN ENERGY REQUIREMENTS. NOBODY'S GONNA TELL THE CCA WHAT SPECIFIC PROJECT TO BUY OR BUILD NO ONE'S GOING TO NULLIFY SOMEONE'S CONTRACT WHAT THEY WILL SAY IS YOU NEED X. Y. Z. ATTRIBUTES IN YOUR PORTFOLIO. PROOF PROOF TO US THAT YOU'VE DONE THAT. AND SO THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SAYING THAT THIS BILL IS NECESSARY BECAUSE UNDER UNDER CURRENT LAW. IT THE PCD. DOES NOT HAVE. ADEQUATE AUTHORITY -- TO TO ENFORCED THE RELIABILITY OF CONCERNS OF OF THE C. C. A. R. R. I. R. PEAS. AT EDISON BELIEVES THAT THERE ACTUALLY IS SUFFICIENT AUTHORITY IN AND THE LAW FOR THE CPC -- TO TO ENFORCE THESE -- ATTRIBUTE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CCA AND EASE P. COMMUNITY -- SIGNIFICANTLY CONTEST THAT ARE AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE SUPPORT SB ONE FIFTY FIVE IT'S MAKING CLEAR UP THE DOES IN FACT THE CPC'S ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITY [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] BOB. EFFORT RE RE WOULD DISLIKE HIM TO YEAH OUR FIRST LOOK MUMMY RESPOND THAT THE CCA'S LANGUAGE TOTALLY UNDERMINES THE AUTHORITY. OF THE P. YOU SEE TO DO THEIR JOB IF YOU READ WHAT HAS BEEN OP ARE AS IT RELATES TO JUST WHAT MR CHRISTIE STATED. THE R. P. -- OVERSIGHT IS A BI ANNUAL REVIEW. THEY'VE JUST COMPLETED THE FIRST TWO YEARS AND THAT'S WHAT'S COME BACK WITH THE REPORT THE STATE THAT WERE IN NEED OF MORE RELIABILITY. AND I SIT HERE AS PRIDE THE ONLY pWORK FOR UTILITY COMPANY. TURN ENERGY CRISIS. AND REAP LIABILITY OUTSIDE OF SAFETY IS THE NUMBER ONE CONCERN. AND YOU CONTINUE TO HAVE. ENTITIES WHO WANT. TO BEHAVE LIKE A UTILITY BUT DON'T WANT TO BE REGULATED AND MONITORED LIKE A UTILITY ARE THE CURRENT. LOWERED ITS SOUL. A FLUCTUATING NOW BECAUSE OF RENEWABLES LIKE LIKED MISTER CHRISTIAN STATED EVERY NOBLE COMMODITY IS NOT DISPATCH PULL. IT INTERMENT ADD BASS SO YOU CONTINUE TO HAVE THE PACKET OUT WHAT OTHER RESOURCES BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S AVAILABLE AT ANY GIVEN TIME. AND NOT TO REPORT AND NOT TO HAVE THIS OVERSIGHT LEAVES THIS WHOLE STATE VULNERABLE AND WILL BE SETTING THE CALIFORNIA UP AGAIN. AND WE COME BACK YEAR AFTER YEAR BECAUSE WE MAKE A MAJOR MISTAKE HERE WE LET LEGISLATORS WITH NO EXPERIENCE AND POLICY -- AND POWER IN GENERATION. MAYBE WITH THIS EXCEPTION. VERY FEW MAKE ENERGY POLICY HERE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT'S WHY AS STATED WE DON'T LAST THING WE WANTED TO LET OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO BE RESPONSIBLE [inaudible] FOR I MEAN. THAT WE DON'T. SO WE NEED TO BE UC'S OVERSEE S. SITE WE NEED TO SEE YOU SEE WE NEED THOSE FOLKS WHO. ARE PAID TO DO THIS. AND EXPERIENCE TO DO IT MR WHAT SHOULD. I WOULD JUST ADD MISTER. CHAIRMAN I THINK THE THE THE BEST ARGUMENT FOR THE NEED OF THIS BILL WAS MADE BY THE OPPOSITION. IN THAT THE FIRST DIRE P. REPORT CAME BACK AND FOUND DEFICIENCIES. WE NEED TO PROTECT AGAINST A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE. A. C. C. A. R. D. S. P. WHO'S COMPLETELY ABDICATED THE RESPONSIBILITY TO THE EXTREME. IF THE PC DOESN'T HAVE. THE ABILITY TO GO IN AND FORCED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM IS SAFE AND RELIABLE WE COULD REALLY BE IN THE SOUP. AND SO WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THEY HAVE APPEALED THE FIRST DIRE P. WE'RE ALREADY INTO THE SECOND OUR P. CYCLE AND THEY'RE STILL TRYING TO APPEAL AND FIGHT OVER THE FIRST. ONE WHAT IF THIS CONTINUES AD NAUSEAM AND YOU HAVE A P. YOU SEE THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO PROTECT THE ENTIRE GRID THAT'S SIMPLY WHY THIS BILL IS NEEDED. MISTER TECH CAN I JUST MAKE ONE LAST POINT. ONE RESPONSE THANK YOU SIR -- FIRST OF ALL THERE WAS EIGHT THE WITH SOME CCA'S WHAT MR WATCHES TELLING YOU HALF THE STORY ON IS THAT WITH SOME CCA'S THEIR I. R. PEAS WERE FOUND TO BE NOT COMPLETED. BASED ON THE TECHNICAL ISSUE OF HOW CRITERIA POLLUTANTS WAS REPORTED THEY HAVE BEEN REFILED THERE'S NO ISSUE WITH THEM SO HE'S MADE AMOUNT MAKE AN AMOUNT NOT A WHOLE HELL OF MOLE HILL AND LAST POINT. IS ALL THE ISSUES THAT SENATOR BRADFORD RAISED ABOUT CONCERN FOR THE STATE INFRASTRUCTURE ETCETERA ETCETERA ETCETERA. I MEAN IF IF THAT'S THE CONCERN. YOU KNOW THE IRP PROCESS IS THE LEAST OF THE PROBLEMS THE BIG PROBLEM IS THAT ONE OF THE THREE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES WENT IS IN BANKRUPTCY. THAT'S THE BIG PROBLEM AND I THINK WE HAVE TO BE SORT OF HAVE THIS IN PERSPECTIVE ALL THIS NIGHTMARE SCENARIO THAT STATED REALLY IS NOT A CONCERN. THANK YOU [inaudible] THE SO. AS BRADFORD THE THE COMMITTEE -- HAS REVIEWED YOUR BILL WERE DONE IN ALICE'S SIDE WE'RE RECOMMENDING IT TO PASS -- WE ARE. THIS IS NOT A CONDEMNATION ON CCA'S OF THIS IS A RECOGNITION THAT THERE IS A MARKET THAT WE HAVE TO BE VERY KEENLY AWARE OF THAT IS FRAGILE. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE ARE -- ANTICIPATING AND CERTAINLY THE CPUC PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE. IN ALL OF THIS THAT RESOURCE ADEQUACY IS AN AREA THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO TO BE VIGILANT OVER -- THERE WILL BE RETIRING OF OF PLANTS THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT. CAN CONTINUE TO PUT US IN A VULNERABLE POSITION -- TO THE POINT WHERE THE CPUC HAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GOING TO LET THEM GO OFFLINE SO. THERE IS A A LOT OF SHIFTING GOING ON OUT THERE AND THOSE WHO ARE -- ACTIVELY I THINK IS YOUR BILL IS TRYING TO SAY IF YOU'RE GOING TO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN THIS MARKET PLACE THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECOGNITION. THAT PERFORMANCE STATES TO BE OUT OF A LEVEL THAT'S LOOKING TO THE LARGE SHORT. MEDIUM AND LONG TERM -- SO WE WE APPRECIATE YOUR POSITION TODAY WE APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR COMMENTS -- THERE NO OTHER COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. CENTER BRADFORD IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE I I THINK YOUR COMMENTS MISTER CHAIRMAN I SURMISED IT'S ADEQUATE CLOSE I WOULD TO STATE I AM ALSO JUST WOULD RESPOND TO THE QUESTION OF LONG TERM CONTRACTS. AGAIN WHAT THE IN OUR RESPONSES INTO ENERGY CRISIS IN TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND ONE WAS A FAILURE TO ENTER INTO LONG TERM CONTRACTS TO LOCK IN PROCUREMENT AT A STABLE PRICE. THIS YEAH I JUST WANT TO ADDRESS THAT NO ONE SEEMS TO MENTION THAT BUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND I THINK THAT THERE WAS -- AT LEAST AT THE FIRST PART OF THIS THERE IS A RECOGNITION THAT -- I GUESS WHEN THE BILL WAS IN THE SENATE THERE WERE SOME AREA OF AND QUESTION ABOUT ENFORCEMENT SO I ASSUME THAT. CONVERSATIONS WILL CONTINUE AND YOU. HAVE A DIALOGUE -- THERE'S BEEN A MOTION AND A SECOND. THIS IS A I'M SORRY. THE MOTION A SECOND THIS IS A DO PASS -- TO NATURAL RESOURCES CALDERON.
