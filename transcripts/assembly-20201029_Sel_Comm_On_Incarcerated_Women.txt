THIS HEARING IS SCHEDULED TO GO UNTIL TWO PM AT WHICH POINT WE WILL HAVE TO CONCLUDE TO ALLOW FOR PROPER DISINFECTANT AND CLEANING. SO THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR PATIENCE. WE HAD ORIGINALLY PLANNED TO HOST THE SELECT COMMITTEE HEARING INSIDE ONE OF THE WOMEN'S PRISONS. SO THAT WE COULD TALK WITH WOMEN INSIDE AS WELL AS THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN RELEASED AND ARE ADVOCATING ON BEHALF OF INCARCERATED WOMEN. WE ALSO HAD PLANNED A FINANCIAL LITERACY WORKSHOP WITH SOME CREDIT UNION PARTNERS. AS WE LEARNED THAT FINANCIAL LITERACY. WAS A TOPIC OF GREAT INTEREST TO WOMEN WHO ARE INCARCERATED AND ARE GETTING READY FOR RELEASE. THOSE PLANS OBVIOUSLY WERE STALLED AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC BUT NEVER THE LESS THIS COMMITTEE HAS PERSISTED BECAUSE THE ISSUES AND FOCUS OF THIS COMMITTEE SEEM MORE IMPORTANT NOW THAN EVER BEFORE. THIS IS THE SECOND HEARING OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE THE FIRST WAS HELD IN LOS ANGELES AND FOCUSED ON THE MANY WAYS WOMEN FIND THEMSELVES INTRODUCED TO THE CARCERAL SYSTEM. WE HAD WOMEN OF DIFFERENT RACES ETHNICITIES AND GENDER IDENTIFIED ORIENTATION. DISCUSS THEIR JOURNEY INTO PRISON FOR MANY IT SEEMED TO BE A COMBUSTIBLE COCKTAIL OF POVERTY. PREVIOUS ABUSE SUBSTANCE ADDICTION UNSTABLE HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT. AND VOLATILE POWER BASED RELATIONSHIPS WITH A PARTNER THAT LANDED THEM IN THE SYSTEM. WE ALSO HEARD FROM PRACTITIONERS FROM THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND PROGRAMS LIKE THE OFFICE OF DIVERSION REHABILITATION WHO SHARED THEIR ROLE IN THE CHARGING SENTENCING AND REHABILITATION OF WOMEN. NEEDLESS TO SAY THERE WERE SOME DIVERGENCES WHICH I CONSIDER TO BE OPPORTUNITIES. FOR FUTURE POLICY M. SYSTEM CULTURE CHANGE. THIS SELECT COMMITTEE HEARING WILL FOCUS ON WHAT HAPPENS TO WOMEN INSIDE OF PRISON THERE WILL BE A PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON HEALTH AND SAFETY AND HOW THE CALIFORNIA PRISON SYSTEM HAS RESPONDED TO THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF INCARCERATED WOMEN DURING THIS PANDEMIC. BUT I WANT TO REITERATE THAT THE TESTIMONY MAY AND CAN ALSO COVER ISSUES OF TREATMENT ABOVE AND BEYOND THE PANDEMIC. IT IS FAIR TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WOMEN ARE ABUSED AND ASSAULTED IN PRISON AND THAT THE SAME SEXUAL POWER DYNAMICS. THAT OCCUR OUTSIDE OF THE CARCERAL SYSTEM ON ALSO HAPPEN WITHIN AN- IN ORDER TO FORMULATE SOLUTIONS WE NEED INPUT NOT ONLY FROM OUR LEGISLATORS. BUT ALSO FROM OUR SYSTEM AFFECTED. SISTERS I AM THANKFUL TO HAVE THIS OF MY FELLOW COME MEMBER AND SUCH SOLUTIONS. AND SO THEY DO ALL I GO SEE ANY HERE PHYSICALLY I WANNA OPEN THE FLOOR FOR ANY MEMBERS TO PROVIDE WELCOME REMARKS ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER- HAD. CONFIRM THAT HE WOULD BE IN ATTENDANCE AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER WALDRON- HAD CONFIRMED SHE WOULD BE IN ATTENDANCE THROUGH THE VIDEO CONFERENCING SO I WANT TO. SEE IF EITHER OF THEM. I MEAN I DON'T SEE MISTER COOPER SO HOPEFULLY HE'S NOT GHOST BUT- IF MISS WALDRON IS ON THE LINE I'D LIKE TO OPEN IT UP TO HER AND ANY OTHER MEMBERS. HELLO MADAM FAIR CAN YOU HEAR ME YES AND WE CAN SEE YOU GO. I'M HERE I'M SO EXCITED TO BE HERE TODAY AND- VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THIS SELECTIVITY THAT YOU PUT TOGETHER- I DO KNOW THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS HAS MADE- INCARCERATED WOMEN A PRIORITY AS PART OF THE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS THAT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. AND IN NINETEEN EIGHTY AND CALIFORNIA- WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA JAILS HAS INCREASED 210010% AND THE NUMBER OF WOMEN IN STATE PRISONS HAS INCREASED A WHOPPING. FOUR HUNDRED AND 33% HUESO FAIR. IN CARTS REMAINS WRITING WITH WHY. WOMEN CONSTITUTE A RISING NUMBER BEHIND BARS AND THAT IS A VERY BIG CONCERN AND MAKE THE WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE THAT MUCH MORE IMPORTANT AS WE TACKLE THE ISSUES. THAT ARE FACING- WHAT WHAT'S CAUSING THIS TO BRING MORE WOMEN INTO REHABILITATION AND RESTORATION RATHER THAN INTO INCARCERATION AND MORE TRAUMA TO THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. YOU KNOW SO MANY OF US SOUNDS OF THE BATTLE CRY BACK IN THE BEGINNING IN MARCH WHEN THE PANDEMIC- FIRST MADE ITS APPEARANCE. AND YOU KNOW WE LOOK AT THAT NEED FOR EMERGENCY PLANNING IN OUR PRISONS AND ARE JAIL- THE NEED FOR ADEQUATE RESOURCES AND PROTECTION BOTH FOR THOSE PEOPLE INCARCERATED AS WELL AS THE GUARDS AND THE STAFF. BUT UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF THAT FELL ON DEAF EARS AND THEN WE HAVE TO SIT BY AND WATCH AS- SO YOU ARE BEHIND BARS GOT IT ALL. SORRY THIS AND MANY WITHOUT ANY ABILITY TO SPEAK WITH THEIR LOVED ONES OR HAVE LOVED ONES NEAR DURING THOSE TIMES OF TOM. SO I KNOW WILL HEAR. EMOTIONAL TESTIMONY TODAY. AND IT'S VERY THAT THEY COME THE WHITE. AND I JUST WANTED YOU AGAIN MADAM CHAIR FOR PUTTING THIS COMMITTEE TOGETHER. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WALDRON FOR THOSE PROVOCATIVE AND THOUGHTFUL WORDS. AND WE HAVE BEEN JOINED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOPER WHO I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE TO MAKE ANY INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. THANK YOU. ARCHER ONE I'M EXCITED TO BE HERE AND LOOKING FOR DISCUSSION A LOT GOING ON INMY FORMER LIFE I WAS THE CAPTAIN WITH THE SECOND COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. NO THE JOKE COMMANDER FOR TWO YEARS- THE JUDGE OF THE COURT OF THE HOUSE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED PRE TRIAL INMATES IN THERE SO AND A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WOMEN IN INCARCERATION. AND THE ONE THING THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME RIGHT NOW THE- RECIDIVISM RATE FOR CDC IS OVER 50% MAYBE EVEN SIXTY PERCENT. AND THAT'S A BIG ISSUE WEREN'T ENOUGH WITH THAT AND NO ONE IN THE ADMINISTRATION OR ANYWHERE. IN GOVERNMENT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO GOVERNMENT TO TABLE TO SERVE AS A RATE IS FOR COUNTY JAILS. IN MOST FOLKS ARE BEING SENT TO COUNTY JAILS THERE IS THE RATE MAY BE UP 270% NOBODY ELSE SO WE'VE GOT TO HAVE. BETTER PROGRAMS MORE EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS OUT THERE- TO MAKE SURE THESE WOMEN GET THE TREATMENT THEY NEED. AND A LOT OF THE MORE VICTIMS I MEAN VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND OTHER ABUSES AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING. AND RIGHT NOW THE LAWS IN CALIFORNIA DON'T REALLY. IMPACT THE PERPETRATORS THE MEN THAT COMMIT THESE TYPE OF CRIMES SO WE GOTTA DO A BETTER JOB ALL THE WAY AROUND TO LOOKING FORWARD TO. DISCUSSION FOR MY COLLEAGUES IN HEARING FROM- SOME THE ADVOCATES AND VICTIMS INVOLVED SO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER COOPER ALSO FOR THOSE THOUGHTFUL AND PROVOCATIVE WORDS I'D LIKE TO JUST- ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS A- AT BIPARTISAN ATTENDANCE AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WE HAVE FOLKS FROM. NORTH TO SOUTH AND- FROM ALL PARTS OF THE SPECTRUM THAT ARE INVESTED IN THIS ISSUE. SO NOW I'D LIKE TO PASS IT OVER TO ME COME. MODA WHOSE POLICY THE DIRECTOR OF THE YOUNG WOMAN FREEDOMS. FOR A BRIEF AND- TO HERE. WILL BE SET. THE TAPE FOR US. THANK YOU AND WELCOME THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS TO MICAH MOTA AND THE STATEWIDE POLICY DIRECTOR AT THE YOUNG WOMEN'S FREEDOM CENTER AND A CO FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE SYSTEM FOR YEARS FREEDOM COALITION. END OF FORMERLY INCARCERATED WOMAN WHO SPENT SEVEN YEARS INSIDE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTIONS. THE YOUNG WOMAN'S FREEDOM CENTER HAS BEEN WORKING IN CALIFORNIA FOR OVER TWENTY SEVEN YEARS TO LIFT UP THE VOICES AND EXPERIENCES OF DIRECTLY IMPACTED PEOPLE. THE SISTER WARRIORS FREEDOM COALITION IS A NETWORK OF OVER SEVEN HUNDRED CURRENTLY AND FORMERLY INCARCERATED AND DIRECTLY IMPACTED. WOMEN TRANS AND GENDER EXPANSIVE FOLKS WORKING TO SHIFT POWER IN CALIFORNIA. WE COLLECTIVELY DRAFTED A FREEDOM CHARTER WHICH WE USE AS A NORTH STAR FOR OUR MOVEMENT. ONE OF THOSE CHARTER STATES WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE CONSULTED WHEN INSTITUTIONS WANT TO CREATE REVISED AND ELIMINATE POLICIES LEGISLATION RULES OR LAWS. THAT WILL IMPACT THE WAY WE EXPERIENCE SYSTEMS. THIS HEARING HONORS THAT CHOI BY BRINGING ALL TO. WE BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN MOST IMPACTED BY INCARCERATION AND SYSTEMS THEIR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES ARE THE EXPERTS IN THEIR OWN LIVES AND BEST POSITION TO COLLECTIVELY IDENTIFY ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION CRIMINALIZATION AND FAMILY SEPARATION. WE ALSO FAITHFULLY SHOW UP FOR EACH OTHER AND FOR THE ONES THAT WE HAVE LEFT BEHIND IN PRISON. CALIFORNIA STATE PRISONS HAVE BEEN UNDER FEDERAL RECEIVERSHIP FOR OVER TWO DECADES. FOR FAILING TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE HEALTH CARE. IN THE WOMEN'S PRISONS WE HAVE SEEN THIS PLAY OUT IN SPECIFIC WAYS. INCLUDING FORCED STERILIZATIONS. SEVERE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH CARE NEGLECT INCLUDING TRANS WOMEN AND MEN. GENDER BASED AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND A SUICIDE EPIDEMIC. THE CONDITIONS THAT HAVE CREATED THIS CRISIS OUR LONG STANDING AND WITH UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS AND RANKS OF INCARCERATION AND POLICIES THAT HAVE IMPACTED THE MOST STRUCTURALLY MARGINALIZED POPULATIONS. ON OCTOBER TWENTY FOURTH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION RELEASED A STATEMENT DECLARING THAT PRISONS ARE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. THE TOP THREE APHA RECOMMENDATIONS ARE ALIGNED WORK WITH WHAT ADVOCATES HAVE BEEN CALLING FOR. TO URGENTLY REDUCE THE INCARCERATED POPULATION TODAY BEST FROM PERSONAL SYSTEMS AND INVEST IN HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT. AND SUMMIT COULD TO COMMIT TO NON PERSONAL MEASURES FOR ACCOUNTABILITY SAFETY AND WELL BEING. AS COVERT NINETEEN SWEEPS THROUGH THE PRISONS WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THE CAR SERRATION. IT IS A CRITICAL TIME TO READ OR PAROLE WITH SERIOUS AND CHRONIC ILLNESSES. THE RELEASE RATE FOR PEOPLE THAT CDCR AND THE RECEIVER HAVE ASSESSED AS ELIGIBLE FOR RELEASE BASED ON HIGH RISK MEDICAL STATUS. IS LESS THAN 1% WE BELIEVE THAT LARGE SCALE RELEASES ARE SAFE AND RESPONSIBLE OPTION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR CONVENING THIS HERE TODAY THANK YOU SEE YOU SEE ARE FOR BEING HERE AND FOR THE FORMERLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE COMING TO JOIN THIS PANEL AND LIFT UP MY SISTERS ON SET WE THINK YOU. THANK YOU AND MICAH AS ALWAYS. WE ARE PROUD TO HAVE YOU AS AN ALLY. OF THIS COMMITTEE.

GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS HEIDI POWER I SERVICE THE DEPUTY MEDICAL EXECUTIVE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH FOR CDCR AND FOR THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES. I'M HERE TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF OUR EFFORTS TO RESPOND TO THE CALVET NINETEEN PANDEMIC WHICH REMAINS THE HIGHEST HEALTH AND SAFETY PRIORITY. FOR OUR DEPARTMENT. SINCE EARLY MARCH. TWENTY TWENTY THE DEPARTMENT HAS IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF SYSTEM WIDE STRATEGIES AND PRACTICES TO PREVENT CONTAIN THE MONITOR AND COMMUNICATE THE IMPACTS OF PROBATE NINETEEN ON OUR RESIDENT POPULATION AND STUFF. WE CONTINUOUSLY UPDATE THESE STRATEGIES AND PRACTICES AS NEW INFORMATION ABOUT THE DISEASE AND ITS MANAGEMENT ARE PROMULGATED BY FEDERAL AND STATE PUBLIC HEALTH AUTHORITIES. BASED ON LESSONS LEARNED FROM SAN QUENTIN AND OTHER OUTBREAKS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS. THESE STRATEGIES AND PRACTICES ARE FUNDAMENTALLY MEANT TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF BRINGING THE VIRUS INTO THE FACILITIES. INTERRUPT THE SPREAD OF PROBATE NINETEEN. PROVIDE TIMELY AND EXTENSIVE TESTING TO PATIENTS AND STUFF. APPROPRIATELY HOUSE INDIVIDUALS WHO REQUIRE ISOLATION OR QUARANTINE. MONITOR PATIENTS WHO ARE ILL AND. PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY MEDICAL CARE. AND PRINT PATIENTS WHO ARE VULNERABLE TO EXPERIENCING SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS FROM THIS DISEASE. IN ORDER TO MITIGATE EXPOSURE AND SPREAD TEST ISOLATED QUARANTINE AND PROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE AND PROVIDE CLINICAL CARE TO SYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS HE STRATEGIES AND PRACTICES WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO. THE EXPEDITED RELEASE OF NEARLY TEN THOUSAND VIGILS INCLUDING OVER NINE HUNDRED WOMEN. STOP TO VISITATION IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY. IMPLEMENTED SYMPTOM AND TEMPERATURE SCREENING AND PHYSICAL DISTANCING. DISTRIBUTED PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND CLOCK FACE COVERINGS FOR STAFF AND RESIDENTS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. IMPLEMENTED DISINFECTION PRACTICES AND PROVIDED HAND SANITIZERS. STOPPED IN TAKE FROM JAILS WHICH HAS RECENTLY BEEN SLOWLY RESUMED UNDER VERY TIGHT RESTRICTIONS. THE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE MOVEMENTS WITHIN THE PRISON AND ACROSS PRESENTS WITH VERY STRINGENT TESTING AND QUARANTINE PRACTICES WHEN MOVEMENT IS NECESSARY. WE'VE DEPOPULATED DORMS AND OPEN SO FRONT HOUSING. WE'VE EXPANDED TESTING CAPACITY AND REDUCE TURNAROUND TIMES TO RECEIVE MOST PROBATE NINETEEN TEST RESULTS WITHIN TWO DAYS FOR BOTH RESIDENTS AND STAFF. IMPLEMENTED RIGOROUS CONTACT INVESTIGATIONS FOR THOSE EXPOSED AND CLOSE CLINICAL MONITORING OF THOSE IN QUARANTINE AND ISOLATION. IDENTIFIED ADDITIONAL ISOLATION AND QUARANTINE SPACE INCLUDING THE USE OF TENSE AND RE PURPOSED AREAS OF THE PRISONS. PROVIDING ONGOING COMMUNICATION TO STAFF AND RESIDENTS THROUGH A NUMBER OF MECHANISMS AND FORUMS. ADDING ONGOING EXTENSIVE TRAINING TO CLINICAL STAFF TO ENSURE THAT THEY REMAIN UP TO DATE. WE'VE DEVELOPED SEVERAL ELECTRONIC TOOLS TO TRACK TESTING AND RELEASE INFORMATION AND MONITOR ASPECTS OF PATIENT CARE. AND WE ARE CONTINUALLY UPDATING OUR ONLINE GUIDANCE THAT FEATURES INFORMATION ON VARIOUS TOPICS TO ASSIST WITH THE MANAGEMENT OF PROBATE NINETEEN OUTBREAKS AND PATIENCE WITH PROBATE NINETEEN. WITH REGARD TO WOMEN WE HAVE HAD THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE CASES APPROPRIATE NINETEEN AMONG WOMEN INCLUDING ONE PREGNANT WOMAN WHO WAS A SYMPTOMATIC. THIRTEEN PATIENTS WERE HOSPITALIZED AND THERE WAS ONE DEATH. COMPARED TO MEN IN OUR PRISON SYSTEM FEMALE INFECTION RATE IS ABOUT 30% LOWER AND HOSPITALIZATION AND DEATH RATES. PER POPULATION ARE ABOUT HALF THE RATES FOR MALES. THERE'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF POSITIVE TESTS THAT WE'VE HAD DESPITE VERY AGGRESSIVE TESTING STRATEGIES. THE CURRENT AND FUTURE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES WE ARE FOCUSED ON RIGHT NOW INCLUDE PREPARING FOR FLU SEASON. AND WRAPPING UP EDUCATING RESIDENTS AND STAFF ABOUT THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF BEING VACCINATED FOR INFLUENZA OFFERING VACCINATION TO ALL RESIDENTS. IDENTIFYING PATIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY INFECTED WITH PREVENT WHO ARE POSITIVE. WHO ARE PAST THEIR NINETY DAYS. M. MAY TEST AGAIN SO FAR WE ARE WORKING. WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FIVE LAB AND WE HAVE NOT I'D ANY PERSONS WHO ARE RE INFECTED WITH THIS VIRUS BUT WE ARE MONITORING VERY CLOSELY. IDENTIFYING IN CARING FOR PATIENTS WHO MAY HAVE LONG TERM SICK QUALIFY OR COMPLICATIONS FROM THEIR COVERT INFECTION THAT GO ON FOR WEEKS OR MONTHS. DESPITE THE REDUCTION IN POPULATION CENSUS OVER TE LAST FEW MONTHS CDCR REMAINS ONE OF THE LARGEST CONGREGATE SETTINGS IN CALIFORNIA. SO WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO FIND WAYS TO PROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE PATIENTS FROM GETTING INFECTED. INCLUDING ALLOWING THEM TO MOVE OUT OF DORMS AND OPEN CELL DOOR SETTINGS. SHE CAN CONSIDERATION FOR RELEASE OF PATIENTS WHO ARE AT HIGHER RISK FOR PROBATE NINETEEN RELATED COMPLICATIONS WHO ARE LIVING IN DORM SETTINGS SHOULD CONTINUE. WE ARE PARTICIPATING IN PLANNING EFFORTS WITH THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION AND CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO PREPARE FOR PREVENT NINETEEN VACCINE WHEN IT BECOMES AVAILABLE. WE ARE COLLABORATING WITH ACADEMIC PARTNERS AND PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS TO UNDERSTAND FACTORS THAT WE CAN ALTER OR STEPS THAT WE CAN TAKE TO PREVENT AND MITIGATE INFECTION WITH FROM PROBATE NINETEEN. WE ARE EXPANDING EMPLOYEE HEALTH SERVICES INCLUDING FREQUENT TESTING AND RIGOROUS CONTACT INVESTIGATIONS TO MITIGATE THE SPREAD TO OTHER STOP AND RESIDENTS. WE'RE CAREFULLY PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING A PHASED IN APPROACH TO SAFELY RE OPEN PROGRAMS AND VISITING. THIS CONCLUDES MY OPENING REMARKS I LOOK FORWARD TO QUESTIONS AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OTHER WORK WE'VE BEEN DOING. AND WE CONTINUE TO DO TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR RESIDENTS INCLUDING WOMEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.

PERIOD OF TIME FOR THE OUTBREAK- INDIAN CDC ARE AS WAS MENTIONED HAVE STOPPED INTAKE FROM THE JAILS- AND THEN THEY ACTUALLY HAD BEGUN TO DO SOME RELEASES BUT I DON'T I DON'T HAVE ANY OF THOSE NUMBERS. BUT WE CAN MAKE A NOTE. THANK YOU I DON'T KNOW IF ASSEMBLY MEMBER WALDRON. IS STILL WITH US- HELLO YES I AM HERE YES DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE PANELISTS HERE YOU ARE. HI I DO ACTUALLY- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT COLD DID WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL AT DOING WAS BRINGING TO LIGHT- OF A VAST NUMBER OF DEFICIENCIES IN OUR STATE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS FROM DDD IS THE ENVY OF ALL OF THE OTHER THINGS WE SAW BUT NOWHERE IS THAT MORE STRIKINGLY EVIDENT. THAT WE HAVE DEFICIENCIES ARE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY- WE HEARD THE HORROR STORIES WE KNEW UNFORTUNATELY THAT A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT ENDED UP MANIFESTING WE'RE GOING TO HAPPEN- DESPITE CALLS BY SO MANY ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF THOSE WHO ARE INCARCERATED AS WELL AS THOSE WHO WORK IN THOSE FACILITIES- WE DID HEAR THE HORROR STORIES WE HEARD THEM FROM THOSE INSIDE. WE HEARD THEM FROM FAMILY MEMBERS WE HEARD IN FROM CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS WHO WERE FORCED TO BASICALLY SLEEP IN THEIR OWN CARS OR IN THEIR GARAGES FOR FEAR OF BRINGING CALLED IT INTO. THEIR FAMILIES WHEN THEY WENT HOME. SO WE ALSO KNOW THE FACT THAT. INCORPORATE PEOPLE. HAVE A HIGHER RATE OF THAT THE- OR- HEALTH PROBLEMS MORE SO THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION. AND WE ALSO KNOW AND I'VE HAD A SUCCESSION WITH BOTH THE CDC ARE- THE CONDITIONS THERE AND THE FACILITIES MANY OF THEM ARE. DILAPIDATED AND. JUST THE CONDITIONS ARE. NOT AT ALL YOU MAIN CONDITION AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE BUILDINGS ARE ABOUT. THE AGE AGING OF THE BOTH THE BILITY- THAT HAVE NOT BEEN UPGRADED I THOUGHT ALL OF THE THINGS LEAD TO A VAST AMOUNT OF- INCREASING OF TRAUMA AND THE HORROR STORIES THAT WE HEARD I'M GOING INTO THIS SO MY QUESTION BASICALLY IS- YOU KNOW. VISITATION WILL STOP. APPARENTLY IT'S STILL STOP WHEN WILL THAT COME BACK AND YOU KNOW DURING A TIME LIKE THIS BEING WITH YOUR LOVED ONE HAVING THAT EVEN CONNECTED TO SUCH AN IMPORTANT THING PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN ALMOST ANYTHING ELSE. YET THEY WERE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY DO A- WHETHER IT'S SOCIAL BENEFITS OR WHATEVER IT IS THEY WAY THAT- THOSE INCARCERATED COULD ACTUALLY SEE THEIR LOVED ONES AND YOU KNOW I'D LIKE- A COMMON ADDRESSING THAT AND ALSO WAS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES STOCK. AND IF SO WHY. AND HAVE THEY COME BACK YET. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER I THINK DR pMICROPHONE TO RESPOND TO THOSE QUESTIONS. YES THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THOSE QUESTIONS- SO I'LL TRY TO ADDRESS- VISITATION AS WELL AS THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES VISITATION IS STILL CLOSED AS OF TODAY WE ARE WE HAVE BEEN TALKING. EXTENSIVELY WITH INSTITUTIONS AND HEADQUARTERS TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE RE OPEN VISITING WE DO IT IN A WAY THAT SAFE. AND WE WANT TO FOLLOW THE CALIFORNIA STATE UIDANCE ON LOOKING AT PHASES AND THE PHASES OF THE COUNTY AND THE COMMUNITY WHICH IS GOING TO AFFECT THE RISK. OF STAFF BECOMING INFECTED AND THE REST OF THE INSTITUTION. AND ALSO LOOKING AT THE PHYSICAL LAYOUT OF THE SPACES THAT INSTITUTIONS HAVE AVAILABLE FOR VISITING TO TRY TO IDENTIFY PLACES THAT MAYBE OUTDOORS OR MUCH MORE OPEN AND EXPANSIVE WHERE PEOPLE CAN'T PHYSICALLY DISTANCE- A LOT OF THE RULES AROUND VISITING WILL NEED TO BE LOOKED AT VERY CAREFULLY SUCH AS- NO EATING NO DRINKING NO SHARING FOOD- WE MAY NEED TO LIMIT. PHYSICAL INTERACTIONS SO WE ARE LOOKING AT ALL OF THE STUFF WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE GUIDANCE OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS PROVIDED. FOR RE OPENING LOTS AND LOTS OF DIFFERENT VENUES AROUND THE STATE AND WE'RE USING A LOT OF THE SAME PRINCIPLES AND APPROACHES TO DISTANCING AND MASKING AND- ENVIRONMENTAL DISINFECTION ALL OF THOSE THINGS WILL BE IN PLAY AS WE AS WE RE OPEN VISITING. BUT WE AGREE THAT IT IS A VERY CRITICAL PRIORITY FOR THE POPULATION AND FOR THE FAMILIES TO BE ABLE TO SEE THEIR LOVED ONES AND BE ABLE TO REMAIN CONNECTED. IN TERMS OF THE MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS AND SERVICES IN GENERAL- BACK IN MARCH- WE HAD TO SHUT DOWN A LOT OF ACTIVITIES. BUT THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN AN APPRECIATION FOR WHAT ARE ESSENTIAL ACTIVITIES AND ESSENTIAL SERVICES AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE ESSENTIAL SERVICES. AND SO I CAN'T SPEAK WITH- DETAIL TO THE DATA AND ACCESS TO THE SERVICES BUT- MEDICAL SERVICES HAVE BEEN OPEN THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. INCLUDING THE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PROGRAM TRYING TO CONTINUE TO SCREEN FOLKS TO GET FOLKS ENROLLED IN INVOLVED IN THAT PROGRAM. AND NOW WE'RE AT A POINT WHERE WE'RE EXPANDING THAT AS WELL SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT THE- COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS THAT ARE PART OF THE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PROGRAMS. ARE INTEGRATED WITH THE MEDICAL ASSISTED TREATMENT SO ALL OF THIS IS A CHALLENGE FOR THE COMMUNITY IT'S A CHALLENGE FOR US BUT WE'RE WORKING REALLY HARD TO REOPEN THESE PROGRAMS AND RE ENGAGE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WALDRON DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. ARE NOT AT THIS TIME THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU I HAVE  FEW THAT THEY WILL BE QUICK- AND SO HOPING THE RESPONSES. CAN BE TOO SO THAT WE CAN MOVE TO OUR SECOND PANEL YOU'D MENTIONED- FLU VACCINATIONS ARE THOSE GOING TO BE REQUIRED. OKAY I WAS HAVING A LITTLE PTSD ABOUT THE SKI YEAR EXPERIMENT YES ALRIGHT SO FLU VACCINATION IS NOT REQUIRED IT'S OFFERED AND WE HAVE- EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AND CAMPAIGNS TO REALLY- TRY TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT THAT WITH HOLDEN CIRCULATING AND INFLUENZA CIRCULATING AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED TO BE EXTRA VIGILANT OUR FLU VACCINE UPTAKE IN OUR POPULATION IS AROUND 50% HISTORICALLY WE ARE STRIVING AND 75% AND THOSE OVER AGE SIXTY FIVE. AND SO WE HAVE SOME GOALS WE'VE ALREADY STARTED VACCINE PROGRAMS MANY INSTITUTIONS HAVE ALREADY STARTED- OFFERING THE VACCINES EDUCATING THE POPULATION AND PROMOTING INFLUENZA VACCINE BUT IT IS NOT MANDATED OKAY AND THEN TO PIGGY BACK ON ASSEMBLY MEMBER WALDRON'S QUESTION AROUND MENTAL HEALTH FOR FOLKS WHO ARE NOT INCARCERATED WHO HAVE THE YOU ARE BLESSED ENOUGH TO WORK IN THEIR HOME AND- GO PERIODICALLY TO A PARK OR TO THE GROCERY STORE- BUT ARE AT HOME WORKING OR YOU KNOW HELPING THEIR CHILDREN- GAIN THEIR EDUCATION WE'RE SEEING UPTICKS IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND IN MENTAL HEALTH- SUFFERING SO I CAN ONLY IMAGINE. THAT IT WOULD BE EXACERBATED FOR SOMEONE WHO'S INCARCERATED ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'VE STOPPED VISITATION YOU SAID IT ENACTED- IMPLEMENTED TO SPATIAL DISTANCING PROTOCOLS AND THEN REDUCED ACTIVITIES. SO CAN YOU JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE TO HOPEFULLY SOME OF THE ENHANCED MEASURES AROUND MENTAL HEALTH BECAUSE WE'VE ALSO HEARD ABOUT AN UP IN- SUICIDE INCIDENTS OR- X. CENTER US SO I I'M CONCERNED. THAT WE'RE HOUSING FOLKS THERE'S A LACK OF INFORMATION THAT PEOPLE FIND CREDIBLE COMING TO ALL OF US- THERE'S A LACK OF ACCESS TO PHONES I'VE HEARD THAT THE SOME OF THE MAIL HAS BEEN CURTAILED- SO WHAT I MEAN CAN YOU SPEAK TO SORT OF WHAT YOU'RE SEEING AND MAYBE ELEVATE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE COME UP FROM THE OTHER PANELISTS AROUND. THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS IN THEIR PRISONS. YEAH HEY HERE YOU KNOW I'VE IT'S BEEN CERTAINLY ON OUR RADAR SINCE THE BEGINNING AND I THINK THE CONCERNS ABOUT TO QUARANTINE AND ISOLATION AND WHEN THERE ARE EVEN SMALL OUTBREAKS OFTEN THERE'S HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IDENTIFIED AS POTENTIAL CONTACTS. WHO THEN HAVE TO GO INTO QUARANTINE AND QUARANTINE IS FOURTEEN DAYS WHICH IS A VERY LONG TIME TO BE IN QUARANTINE AND PARTICULARLY IN SOME OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD THAT WERE DESCRIBED. SO I THINK- THERE IF THIS IS BEEN ON THE RADAR AND UNDERSTOOD THAT THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT RISK IN NOT JUST THE PHYSICAL THREAT OF COVERT NINETEEN BUT ALSO THE MENTAL HEALTHCHALLENGES THAT AS YOU SAY ALL OF US ARE. ARE DEALING WITH BUT ESPECIALLY IN OUR PRISONS SO WE HAVE- WE HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM AND I THINK THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING TO FIND CREATIVE WAYS TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES IF. PREVIOUSLY THERE WERE GROUPS OF PEOPLE IF THEY CAN'T SOCIALLY DISTANCE PEOPLE THEY CAN PROVIDE ONE ON ONE COUNSELING- AND SO WE HAVE TRIED SIMILAR TO THE COMMUNITY TO ADAPT TO THE WAY THAT SERVICES ARE PROVIDED. SO THAT THEY CAN BESAFE FROM AN INFECTION CONTROL STANDPOINT THEY CAN BE SAFE FROM MICROBIT NINETEEN STAFF JOINT I DON'T HAVE NUMBERS AND DATA MY FINGERTIPS ON THE MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM BUT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ELEVATE THESE CONCERNS. AND GET MORE INFORMATION FOR THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU I'D LAST FINAL I DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION. FOR THE DOCTOR AND THEY SAID THROUGH SHOTS WERE. OPTIONAL BUT WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE- INMATES. GET UP TO GET FLU SHOTS. DON'T MISS THAT YES SIR WE HAVE A WE ACTUALLY KEEP TRACK OF THE OFFERING AND ACCEPTANCE AND OUR RATE OF. OFFERING IS ALMOST A 100% 99% AND SO EVERY SINGLE PATIENT IS HAS A ONE ON ONE ENCOUNTER WITH THE PROVIDER EDUCATION ABOUT THE VACCINE. AND THEY CAN OPT IN OR OPT OUT TO RECEIVE THE VACCINE AND HISTORICALLY WE'VE HAD AROUND 50% ACCEPTANCE RATE. NOT KNOW ABOUT STAFFERS WHAT'S WHAT'S THE RATE OF STAFF GETTING FLU SHOTS AND YOU ARE THE OFFERED TO STAFF FOR FREE. YEAH THEY'RE OFFERED FOR FREE SO WE HAVE AN EMPLOYEE HEALTH PROGRAM AND THEY COME ON SITE TO THE INSTITUTIONS AND THEY HAVE FLU CAMPAIGNS AND OFFER FLU VACCINE TO THE STAFF- I DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC NUMBERS A LOT OF STUFF TO GET THE VACCINE FROM THEIR PROVIDER OR FROM A DRUG STORE FROM LOTS OF OTHER. OTHER PLACES HISTORICALLY ABOUT RECEIVE THE VACCINE THROUGH THE EMPLOYEE HEALTH CENTER. THAT WE HAVE ON SITE BUT I DON'T HAVE AN OVERALL PERCENTAGE OF ACCEPTANCE FOR THE VACCINE AMONG STAFF OKAY SO THAT'S ALSO OPTIONAL OKAY SO THIS YEAR IN THIS ROOM YESTERDAY WITH A MEETING- WITH PUBLIC HEALTH. AND WE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE- WITH SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND TWENTY PER CENT PERCENT THE STATE'S DEATH FROM COVERT CAME FROM SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. AND YOU KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THAT SO IS THERE ANY PLAN TO MAKE SURE SINCE THIS IS AN AT RISK GROUP WHEN THE VACCINE DOES COME OUT TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE PRIORITIZE. TO GET THE VACCINE FOR COLLUDED. PART FOR ONCE A COVERED VACCINE COMES OUT. YES YOU'RE ASKING YEAH. I WE WILL BE WILL BE WORK WITH THIS. AND WITH THE CDC I BELIEVE THERE'S A TIERED APPROACH TO PRIORITIZING CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS FOR THE PROBATE VACCINE. AND THAT'LL DEPEND ON THE TRIALS AND SORT OF WHO BENEFITS FROM THE VACCINE BUT I BELIEVE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. ARE IN THAT TOP TIER. AND WE ARE ADVOCATING STRONGLY THAT THERE'S CONSIDERATION FOR CUSTODY OFFICERS AND OTHER FOLKS WHO WORK IN HIGH RISK ENVIRONMENTS. BECAUSE NOT ONLY ARE THEY AT RISK OF. BRINGING THE VIRUS INTO THE FACILITIES. BUT THEY ARE AT RISK OF GETTING INFECTED WHILE AT WORK AND SO WE ARE ADVOCATING STRONGLY THAT THEY ARE ALSO PRIORITIZES TOP TIER AND THEN OF COURSE OUR PATIENTS OUR RESIDENTS- GIVEN THEIR UNIQUE RISK. LIVING IN THIS CONGREGATE SETTINGS. NOT SURE ABOUT THE FACT THAT A LOT OF FOLKS GET- DESPONDENT BECAUSE- OBVIOUSLY THERE'S RESTRICTIONS FOR THE CODE TO THE IF THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED VISITORS EITHER SO THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR. GOD SINCE ITS INCEPTION SO SEVEN MONTHS WITH NO VISITORS NOW AND MY MOM'S ALSO IN A IN A- SNIFF RIGHT NOW. SO IS THERE ANY. OTHER GIVING INMATES EXTRA PHONE TIME OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT ARE TRYING. TO LEVY IT SOME. OF THESE THINGS ARE YOU GUYS DOING THAT. YEAH I'M SURE. MISTER ABOUT COULD SPEAK TO BUT YOU. I THERE'S A FREE PHONE TIME THAT'S BEEN MADE AVAILABLE ADDITIONAL PHONE TIME THERE'S BEEN- INTRODUCING TECHNOLOGIES- THAT THAT. COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES LIKE WE'RE USING TODAY- TO CONNECT PEOPLE SO ALL OF THOSE THINGS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED TO THIS GREAT THANK YOU. YEAH DOES THE CHALLENGE AND YES. IS THERE ARE A DIFFICULT BE CUTE. NOUGH YOU HAVE A I WANTED TO JUMP ON THE MENTAL HEALTH. ISSUE WHEN WE YES PLEASE I DO WANTED TO MENTION THAT I YEAH IN RESPONSE TO DOCTORS COMMENT THAT I AND I. THAT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WERE SUPPOSED TO CONTINUE- EMERGENCY SERVICES RIGHT- THROUGH A CO OP ED BUT WHAT WE HAVE SEEN HAPPEN IN THE QUARANTINE UNIT THAT THAT- PEOPLE HAVE SHOWN CLEAR SIGNS OF SUICIDALITY- AND BEEN REFUSED ACCESS TO EVEN BASIC CONTACT WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER- IN ONE CASE YOU KNOW SOMEBODY. THOUGHT THAT THEIR CELL ON FIRE IN AN ATTEMPT TO COMMIT SUICIDE AFTER SHOWING CLEAR SIGNS FOR A WEEK- PEOPLE WERE BEGGING FOR HELP. AND THEN THERE WAS A LACK OF RESPONSE TO THAT- INCIDENTS WHILE WHICH CAUSED ALL SORTS OF PROBLEMS. AND MORE MENTAL HEALTH. THE STRESS FOR EVERYBODY IN THE HORN UNIT RIGHT AND THEN FINALLY WEEKS AND WEEKS IN. MENTAL HEALTH DOT COM AND THEY BROUGHT COLORING BOOKS AND- PUT TOLD YOU KNOW PUSH PUSH THOSE SHEEP UNDER PEOPLE'S DOORS AND THAT WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE. SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW CRISIS CONDITIONS ON TOP OF CRISIS CONDITION. IN THE CONTEXT. OF A OF THE PRISON SYSTEM AND SPECIFICALLY C. I. W. IN THIS CASE. WHERE THERE'S BEEN A SUICIDE CRISIS- THAT WAS EIGHT TIMES THE NATIONAL AVERAGE NOT LONG AGO RIGHT. SO WE ARE LOOKING AT AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS SITUATION- SO I JUST WANT TO POINT TO THE FACT THAT. THE SERVICES DID NOT EXIST EVEN THE EMERGENCY SERVICES THAT SHOWED UP- AND WE'RE VERY CONCERNED THAT THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE AT THIS- COULD CONTINUE TO CYCLE THROUGH THE COULD. THANK YOU FOR THAT COLBY. YOU SAID INCREASED VISITATIONS AS I HOPE THAT ALSO ARE PEOPLE pCOUNCIL TO TALK TO THEIR COUNCIL. NO OKAY ANOTHER QUESTION I HAVE COME IN BUT AND SHARED WAS DENIED ACCESS TO GRIEVANCE PROCESS SEES I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SOMEONE CAN SPEAK TO THAT COME UP FROM ONE OF THE PANELISTS. HI I'M KIM SIDELINE THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF FACILITY OPERATIONS FOR- CDCR AND- YEAH THERE'S BEEN A COUPLE QUESTIONS I CAN ANSWER ON THE PHONES- THERE'S BEEN ACTUALLY BEEN AN INCREASE IN OPPORTUNITIES FOR PHONES. HOWEVER AND THERE HAS BEEN- AN pINCREASE IN HOW WE MAINTAIN THE CLEANLINESS AND SANITATION OF THE PHONES. SO TYPICALLY PRIOR TO CO BID WE WOULD HAVE A FIFTEEN MINUTE PHONE CALLS THEY WOULD SIGN UP AND THEY WOULD JUST BE CONTINUING TO CONTINUING THROUGHOUT THE DAY. HOWEVER WITH HAVING TO MAINTAIN SO MUCH SANITATION WE'VE HAD TO REDUCE THE PHONE CALLS TO ABOUT A TEN MINUTE PERIOD TO ALLOW FOR SANITATION AND THEN WITHIN THE SANITATION THEY HAVE TO DRIVE. WITH THE AIR FOR FIVE TO TEN MINUTES IN BETWEEN EACH VISIT SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT THERE'S NO CONTINUED COBIT IN SEPT- THAT WE'RE IT MIGHT APPEAR THAT THERE'S BEEN A REDUCE PHONE CALLS THERE HASN'T. ARE ALSO OUR PROVIDER DETAIL HAS BEEN PROVIDING TWO DAYS OF FREE PHONE CALLS EACH MONTH SINCE THE START OF COBIT. AND THEN ALSO BACK ON MOTHER'S DAY WE OFFERED VIDEO GROUNDS THAT ARE THREE FEMALE INSTITUTIONS- FOR THE WOMEN AND WE ARE SO ARE STILL- LOOKING IN INTO EXPLORING MORE OTHER VIDEO TYPE- OPPORTUNITIES FOR VIDEOGRAMS AND COMMUNICATION AND WE'RE STILL IN THE EXPLORING STAGE OF THAT THERE WAS A COMMOTION ABOUT ACCESS TO COUNSEL THERE'S BEEN NO- DENIAL. FOR TO ACCESS TO COUNSEL WE'VE BEEN PROVIDING PHONE CALLS AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND ALSO- KIND OF LIKE WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW SKATE. MMHM AND THEN YOU HAD ONE OTHER QUESTION A GRIEVANCE PROCESS GRIEVANCE PROCESS- SO. I'VE I'VE ACTUALLY HEARD THAT MYSELF- I WENT OUT TO ONE OF OUR FEMALE INSTITUTIONS. TO LOOK TO SEE IF THEY'RE STILL EVERYONE STILL HAD ACCESS TO OUR BOXES AND THEY DID- REITERATED WITH OUR INSTITUTIONS THAT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE FORMS. AND THAT THERE ARE STILL BEING CHECKED EVERY DAY QUITE DESIGNATED STAFF THEY'RE LOCKED AND SECURED- IN THE BOXES ARE STILL AVAILABLE WITHIN THE HOUSING UNITS. THANK YOU I'M. I WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON IN THE INTEREST OF TIME TO OUR SECOND PANEL- BUT I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT GTL IS PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE FOR MANY FAMILIES AND I THINK THIS WE'VE ENTERED INTO A TIME WHERE WE SHOULD ACTUALLY BE. RECONSIDERING OUR PRACTICES ABOUT NOT ALLOWING FOLKS WERE INCARCERATED TO HAVE CELL PHONES- SO. THANK YOU PANELISTS FOR YOUR TIME AND PARTICIPATION- I'D LIKE TO NOW MOVE ON TO OUR SECOND PANEL WHO WILL BUILD UPON THE POLICIES WE HEARD ABOUT FROM OUR FIRST PANEL AND HOPEFULLY PROVIDE. INSIGHT INTO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE POLICIES WITHIN FACILITIES. HERE TODAY AT THE CAPITOL WE HAVE KIMBERLY C. ABLE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF FACILITY OPERATIONS DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS. IN ADDITION WE HAVE PATRICIA WRIGHT WHO WAS RECENTLY RELEASED FROM THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE FOR WOMEN AS WELL AS THE ANA CARE AWAY RECENTLY RELEASED FROM. THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S FACILITY BOTH OF THOSE WOMEN WILL BE JOINING VIA REMOTE TESTIMONY. AS WITH OUR FIRST PANEL PLEASE BE AWARE THAT YOU WILL HAVE FIVE MINUTES TO SPEAK AND WE WILL BE GOING IN THE ORDER BY WHICH I INTRODUCED YOU. I WOULD NOW LIKE TO INVITE KIMBERLY SEPAL TO THE MICROPHONE FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. AND THANK YOU- GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT CDC- IS WOMEN'S HEALTH AND SAFETY WITHIN. STATE FACILITIES. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF COVERT NINETEEN WE HAVE TAKEN SEVERAL STEPS TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ALL THOSE LIVING AND WORKING WITHIN OUR INSTITUTIONS. IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY CDCR TOOK IMMEDIATE ACTION TO IMPLEMENT MANY HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTOCOLS. AND PROCESSES WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF OUR HEALTHCARE PARTNERS. C. C. H. C. S. WITH GUIDANCE FROM THE CDC ARE AND CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT COPA NINETEEN WOULD EVENTUALLY RETURN SITUATION SO WE IMPLEMENTED MANY EXTREME MEASURES FOR THE PROTECTION OF EVERYONE. ALL PROGRAMS WERE SUSPENDED TO INCLUDE VISITING AND PROGRAMS ALL NONESSENTIAL STAFF WERE DIRECTED TO TELEWORK TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF STAFF ENTERING THE INSTITUTIONS. SCREENING AND TESTING PROTOCOLS WERE IMPLEMENTED FOR STAFF AND INMATES. EDUCATION POSTERS FLIERS ANNOUNCEMENTS TO GET HIT DETAILING WAYS TO REDUCE AND PREVENT COVERT NINETEEN WERE SHARED WITH STAFF AND INMATE POPULATION. THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN NURSING ROUNDS FOR ALL QUARANTINE AND ISOLATED PATIENTS. PATIENTS RESIDING IN OPEN DORM AREAS RECORDED IN PARTS OF NO MORE THAN EIGHT PER COHORT AND SIX FEET APART FROM EACH OTHER. SOME WERE MOVED TO SELL HOUSING WAS SOUL ITSELF FRONT DOORS. ASIANS WERE FURTHER ENCOURAGED TO SLEEP IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS HEAD TO TOE TO FURTHER REDUCE THE SPREAD OF COVE IN NINETEEN. HAND SANITIZERS ARE PROVIDED IN ALL DINING HALLS HOUSING UNITS OFFICE SPACES IN AREAS OF HIGH TRAFFIC. WE INCREASE THE FREQUENCY OF CLEANING IN TERMINAL CLEANING EFFORTS. IN HIGH VOLUME AREAS SUCH AS DAY ROOMS DINING HALL SHOWERS RESTROOMS AND TELEPHONES. CLOTH BASED MASK WERE PROVIDED TO ALL INMATES AND STUFF. IT WAS ASSIGNED TO AN ISOLATION OR QUARANTINE HOUSING AREA OR PROVIDED IN NINETY FIVE FACE MASKS AS WELL AS OTHER PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. MOVEMENT IS FURTHER RESTRICTED TO THOSE RESIDING IN THE SAME LIVING SPACE TO FURTHER REDUCE CROSS CONTAMINATION AND MOVEMENT. MARKERS ARE PLACED ON THE GROUND SIX FEET APART WERE LINES WOULD FORM FOR MEDICATION DISTRIBUTION CANTEEN LAUNDRY YOUR DINING HALLS AND OTHER AREAS OF THE INSTITUTION TO REMIND EVERYONE. MAINTAIN SOCIAL DISTANCING. REMINDERS ARE ANNOUNCED TO BE OUR PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM EACH DAY ON SECOND AND THIRD WATCH REMINDING EVERYONE TO MAINTAIN SOCIAL DISTANCING AND WEAR. FACE MASKS AND APPROPRIATE PP. INSTITUTIONS ACTIVATED THEIR INCIDENT COMMAND POST WHICH ALLOWED FOR BETTER COORDINATION EFFORTS WITH OUR HEALTHCARE PARTNERS IN TRACKING OF TESTING SURVEILLANCE HOUSING AND MOVEMENT OF THIS OF INMATES. THAT'S REDUCING THE LIKELIHOOD OF CROSS CONTAMINATION. WARDENS ARE CONTINUALLY MEETING WITH THE INMATE ADVISORY GROUPS TO ENSURE THAT THE MOST UP TO DATE INFORMATION IS BEING SHARED BOTH WAYS. WE ACTIVATED NONTRADITIONAL HOUSING AREAS SHOULD THE NEED ARISE TO INCREASE SOCIAL DISTANCING. WE SUSPENDED INTAKE FROM COUNTY JAILS FOR A TIME AND RECENTLY STARTED COUNTY ITAKE WITH COORDINATION WITH OUR COUNTY AND HEALTH CARE PARTNERS TO ENSURE THAT THOSE RECEIVED A CODE FREE. ALL VEHICLES VANS BUSES ARE DISINFECTED BETWEEN EACH TRANSPORT ALL PERSONS AND VEHICLES ARE REQUIRED TO BE IN THE N. NINETY FIVE MASKS WITH APPROPRIATE PP. AND WE FURTHER REDUCE THE NUMBERS OF THOSE BEING TRANSPORTED TO CREATE INCREASED SOCIAL DISTANCING TO REDUCE ANY TRANSMISSION. FOR INSTANCE A BUS CAN TYPICALLY TRANSPORT THIRTY EIGHT PERSONS HOWEVER THAT NUMBERS CURRENTLY BEEN REDUCED TO NINETEEN TO ALLOW FOR SOCIAL DISTANCING. SINCE MARCH RE RELEASED APPROXIMATELY NINE TURNED NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE FEMALE OFFENDERS VIA THE NATIONAL PAROLE OR EXPEDITED PROCESS. IN AN EFFORT TO ALLOW FOR INCREASED FAMILY COMMUNICATION WE'VE INCREASED PHONE CALLS TO CERTAIN PRIVILEGE GROUPS AND OUR TELEPHONE CONTRACTOR AS STATED EARLIER IS PROVIDED ADDITIONAL TWO DAYS OF FREE CALLS EACH MONTH. AND AS I SAY EARLIER ALSO OUR MOTHER'S DAY WEEK VIDEO WERE ALSO FROM FOR THE- FOOD SALES HAVE BEEN PERMITTED ALBEIT WITH STRICT CODE NINETEEN PROTOCOLS BEING FOLLOWED. CDCR HAS FURTHER IMPLEMENTED A WEBSITE AND EMAIL ADDRESS TO ASSIST IN KEEPING FAMILY MEMBERS INFORMED OF OUR EFFORTS. WE CONTINUE WITH PROACTIVE MEASURES TAKEN TO CONDUCTING CONTINUOUS MONITORING SURVEILLANCE AND TESTING OF BOTH INMATES AND STAFF. ALL EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND EMPLOYEE HEALTH UNITS CURRENTLY BEING STOOD UP TO COMPLETE- COMPLETE CONTACT TRACING. RAINING EMPLOYEES A MONITORING AND TRACKING ALL TESTING FOR EMPLOYEES TO PREVENT COBA NINETEEN FROM ENTERING OUR INSTITUTIONS. STAFF AN INMATE EFFORTS HAVE NOT GONE UNNOTICED AND IF PROVEN EFECTIVE AS TWO OF OUR FEMALE INSTITUTIONS OF MOVE TO PHASE TWO PROGRAMMING. PHASE ONE PROGRAMMING AS ARE MOST RESTRICTIVE WILL FACE TO EASE THIS PHASE ONE RESTRICTIONS ALLOWING FOR MOVEMENT AND PROGRAM AREA ACCESS WITHIN OUR INSTITUTIONS. SO WHILE WE HAVE FACED CHALLENGES WITH KOBE NINETEEN WOMEN'S PRISONS WE HAVE QUICKLY ADAPTED AND ARE HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I'M HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO TELL YOU.

BY THE VIDEO CONFERENCING MECHANISM THIS CARE WHERE YOU HEAR. HI YES I'M HERE GREAT THANK YOU. MY NAME IS ANA CALLAWAY I WAS CURRENTLY INCARCERATED OR FORMERLY INCARCERATED AT CC W. F. I WAS RELEASED IN SEPTEMBER AFTER SERVING SEVENTEEN HALF YEARS ON THE SIXTEEN A LIFE SENTENCE- IN MARCH I WORKED AS A SUBSTANCE ABUSE COUNSELOR IN MARCH THEY STOPPED US FROM WORKING AND- DID INSTITUTIONAL QUARANTINE- IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR I WAS FOUND SUITABLE- TO PAROLE. IN JULY WE STARTED BACK WORKING FOR APPROXIMATELY SIX DAYS AFTER THE SIX DAY WE WERE ALL- SENT TO THAT ISOLATED CORENTIN ON A YARD BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN EXPOSED BY TWO OF OUR STAFF THAT TESTED POSITIVE- AFTER THAT I HAVE TESTED NEGATIVE- SEVERAL DAYS LATER THERE WERE FIVE STAFF THAT TESTED POSITIVE. AFTER ELEVEN DAYS BEING IN THE QUARANTINE UNITAND TESTING NEGATIVE IDEA IN A WITH I WAS HOUSE WITH A ROOMMATE MY ROOMMATE FIRST TESTED POSITIVE AND THEN TWO DAYS LATER I TESTED POSITIVE FROM HER. AFTER BEING IN A QUARANTINE UNIT- THE QUARANTINE UNIT WAS ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING AND REGARDLESS OF- THE ATTEMPT FROM CDC ARE TO PROVIDE HAND SANITIZER SOCIAL DISTANCING AND THOSE THINGS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE PREVENTED IT. MATTERS TO HELP WITH NOT CONTRACT THE COLGATE- WE WERE IN THAT ENVIRONMENT THAT WE HAD TO CLEAN UP OURSELVES IN ORDER TO- LIVE IN. HUMANE CONDITIONS WE CLEAN THE CELLS WITH PADS TAMPONS AND OUR OWN CLEANING SUPPLIES WHICH WAS LIKE SHAMPOO- YOU KNOW HAND SOAP THAT WE BUY OUT OF OUR BOXES- THEY GAVE US CLEANING SUPPLIES MAYBE. ONCE A WEEK THAT EVERYBODY USED IN THE SAME ROOM ONCE I TESTED POSITIVE I WAS MOVED TO ANOTHER SIDE OF QUARANTINE- AND PUT IN A SINGLE SALE. AND I MY VITALS WERE TAKEN OPTIONALLY IT WAS NOT MANDATORY FOR ME TO TAKE. MY VITALS BY THE NURSES I NEVER SAW A MEDICAL DOCTOR ARE ONLY SAW AND ARE IN THE WHOLE TIME I WAS SICK- THERE WERE TIMES THAT I COULDN'T EVEN GET OUT OF THE BED. THERE WAS NO MEDICATION GIVEN TO ME THERE WAS NO VITAMINS GIVEN TO ME THERE WAS NO EXTRA VEGETABLES GIVEN TO ME THERE WAS NO WATER GIVEN TO ME- EVERYTHING THAT- ALLOWED ME TO GET BETTER WITH SOMETHING THAT I HAD TO USE WITHIN MYSELF- MY ALL MEANS SO I TAKE VITAMINS EVERYDAY I HAD TO USE MY OWN VITAMINS I BOUGHT WATER OFF THE CANTEEN I HAD TO USE MY OLD WATER BECAUSE- THE WATER OUT OF THE SINK I HAD NO WATER PRESSURE- FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. THE STAFF. TREATMENT THE STAFF WILL COME IN AND SAY THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO WEAR THEIR MASKS BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO CATCH THE VIRUS SO THEY CAN GET TWO WEEKS PAID LEAVE. YOU KNOW THE CONTACT WITH MY FAMILY MY FAMILY WAS CALLING UP TO THE PRISONS TO CHECK ON ME TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH ME BECAUSE I ONLY HAD ACCESS TO EMAIL. AND THEY WERE TELLING MY PARENTS THAT I WAS GETTING THE BEST OF HEALTH CARE. WHEN THAT IS NOT THE TRUTH. AND SO AFTER BEING TESTED NEGATIVE- AND BEING RELEASED FROM THE QUARANTINE- THERE WAS NO PSYCHIC TO COME AND SEE ME BECAUSE- HALF THE SYKES DIDN'T WANT TO COME INTO THE UNITS THAT WERE QUARANTINE BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT EXPOSE THEMSELVES. TO THE VIRUS. WHEN IN ALL ACTUALITY THE INMATES ARE NOT GIVEN IT TO THE STAFF THE STAFF WERE GIVEN IT TO THE INMATES. AND SELL. HOW HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT OURSELVES. WHEN THERE'S NOBODY WELL THERE'S NOT MANY THAT ARE WILLING TO PROTECT US. AND SO WE HAVE STAFFTHAT ARE COMING IN THAT RE WILLING TO CATCH THE VIRUS IN ORDER TO GET A TWO WEEK PAID LEAVE. ANDTHEN OUR MEDICAL SYSTEM. IS NOT ALLOWING US THE PROPER CARE. TO GET WELL AND- THERE GOES THE POPULATION. WHEN IT SPREAD LIKE WILDFIRE- I WAS RELEASED AFTER THAT. A FROM THE QUARANTINE I SAW A DOCTOR ARE IN ONCE AND WHEN I WAS ASKED ABOUT HAVING ANY SYMPTOMS. BEFORE I WAS ASKED ABOUT THE SYMPTOMS I WAS TOLD THAT IF YOU. SAY THAT YOU HAVE ANY SYMPTOMS ARE GOING TO IMMEDIATELY SEND YOU BACK TO QUARANTINE. AND I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO THE QUARANTINE CONDITIONS SO I SAID I DIDN'T HAVE ANY SYMPTOMS IN CONTINUE TO TAKE MY OWN VITAMINS. AND TO WORK OUT TO- PRODUCE A HEALTHIER PUT A NEW SYSTEM. AGAIN LIKE THE HAND SANITIZER THAT WAS GIVEN IN THE UNITS WITH WATERY. THE STAFF JUST WENT ALONG WITH IT BUT WE HEAR THEM SAYING YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO GO OUT TO THIS LITTLE OUT I'M GOING TO GO OUT TO THIS PARTY I'M GOING TO GO HANG OUT HERE SO WE KNEW THAT ON IN THEIR PERSONAL LIVES THEY WERE NOT TAKING PREVENTATIVE MEASURES TO NOT CATCH THE CULPRIT. AND THEN BRING IT BACK INSIDE TO THE INSTITUTION PUTTING ALL INMATES AT DANGER AND SO- YOU KNOW HAVING THE COLD VIRUS BEING LOCKED IN THAT CELL BY MY NOT HAVING ASSISTANCE ONLY SEEN THE NEWS WHERE PEOPLE ARE DYING IN SEEING SOME THE STAFF THAT WORKED AT THE C. W. AT PASSING AWAY ON THE NEWS- YOU WERE LIVING IN FEAR CONSTANTLY WORRYING ABOUT IF YOU ARE GOIN TO DIE. AND ME BEING SO CLOSE TO BEING RELEASED HAVING THAT FEAR BEING SO CLOSE TO BE A RELEASE- WITH OVERWHELMING BECAUSE AFTER BEING INCARCERATED SEVENTEEN AND A HALF YEARS HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO HOME AND THEN CATCHING THE CULPRIT AND NOT BE BEING GIVEN PROPER MEDICAL SERVICES. THE FEAR IS I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE IT OUT I DID I WOULDN'T MADE IT ALL THIS WAY TO NOT MAKE IT OUT AND- YOU KNOW BY THE GRACE OF GOD I HAD THESE ORGANIZATIONS OUT THERE ADVOCATING FOR ME BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT ORGANIZATIONS ADVOCATING FOR ME IT SHOULD BE C. D. C. R. THAT IS PROVIDING FOR ME. WHAT THE TAXPAYERS ARE PAYING FOR PROPER MEDICAL ASSISTANCE PROPER FOOD HEALTHIER LIVING CONDITIONS I SHOULDN'T BE WORRIED ABOUT IF I GET A SHOWER IS IF EITHER I'M GOING TO CATCH THE CULPRIT OR IF I'M GOING TO CATCH A BACTERIAL INFECTION BECAUSE OF. HOW DISGUSTING IT IS. WHEN I GOT OUT THAT WE HAD THE FIRES THAT WERE HAPPENING AND SO. MAYBE IN A HIGH RISK BECAUSE I HAVE ASTHMA NOT ONLY AM I STILL HAVING ISSUES WITH MY BREATHING BECAUSE OF THE COLD AND I'M NOT HAVING ISSUES BREATHING BECAUSE OF THE SMOKE. ON TOP OF MY ASTHMA. I SHOULD HAVE BEEN A HIGH RISK. RELEASED IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A EXPEDITED IMMEDIATELY ONCE I HAD BEEN. FOUND SUITABLE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE PROCEDURE IN OTHER STATES. PEOPLE ARE RELEASED WITHIN THREE DAYS AFTER BEING FOUND SUITABLE IN THE STATE WE HAVE TO WAIT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DAYS FOR GOVERNOR'S RELEASE. WHICH MAKES NO SENSE TO ME ESPECIALLY WITH THIS CULVERT TAKING PLACE RIGHT NOW. THOSE THAT ARE BEING RELEASED ARE DOES THAT- HAVE SHORT TERMS WHICH WE UNDERSTAND BUT THERE ARE ALSO THOSE THAT HAVE LONG TERMS. THAT HAVE HIGH RISK MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED- RIGHT ALONG WITH THE REST OF POPULATION- ACTS THAT YOU. IT LOOKS GOOD ON PAPER WITH WITH THE DOCTORS ARE SAYING HERE ARE WHAT. CITY R. CD C. R. STAYING HERE AOUT WHAT THEY DO TO PREVENT THE MATTERS OF IN MAYES CATCHING THE CULPRIT. BUT IN REALITY IN REALITY IT'S NOT HAPPENING THE WAY IT LOOKS ON PAPER. AND SO I BELIEVE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE ACTION TAKEN FROM THOSE THAT ARE IN POSITIONS TO. TO ACTIVATE- THE PROPER PROCEDURES THE STAFF SHOULD IT SHOULD BE PROPERLY TRAINED AND SHOULD BE HELD TO A HIGHER STANDARD. TO PROTECT THOSE THAT ARE INSIDE BECAUSE WE WERE NOT SENTENCED TO A DEATH SENTENCE WERE SENTENCED TO DO OUR TIME. TO REHABILITATE OURSELVES INTENT THEN TO BE RELEASED INTO SOCIETY AS PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS OF SOCIETY. AND IF WE DO NOT HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT A PRODUCTIVE CITIZEN AS SOCIETY LOOKS LIKE THROUGH THE STAFF THAT WORK THERE. THEN HOW DO YOU EXPECT US TO COME OUT AND TO BE. BETTER PEOPLE. I FEEL AS THOUGH- WITH THE MEDICAL TREATMENT- THE MEDICAL STAFF. NEED TO BE MORE PERSISTENT IN MAKING SURE THAT THOSE THAT HAVE. CONTRACTED THE VIRUS FROM THE STAFF INSIDE THEY GET THE THINGS THAT THEY NEED BECAUSE EVERYBODY CANNOT BE PROVIDED WORK. BY A VENDOR PACKAGE OR BOX OR- SOMEONE ELSE IN THAT IN IN THE UNIT HELPING THEM TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES THE INSTITUTION SHOULD BE PROP PROVIDING THOSE THINGS FOR US. AND SO I JUST ASK THAT YOU GUYS. WILL STEP YOUR GAME AND HELPING THOSE THAT ARE INCARCERATED SO THAT. WE ARE NOT. SO THAT WE ARE NOT- STUCK LIVING IN THE FEAR OF. NOT BEING ABLE TO MAKE IT OUT AND ALSO GIVEN US THAT MENTAL HEALTH BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT OUR PHYSICAL HEALTH IS ALSO ABOUT OUR MENTAL HEALTH AND COMING OUT OF THAT YOU'RE TRAUMATIZED. BECAUSE THEN YOU'RE OSTRACIZED FROM THE POPULATION THE POPULATION- LOOKS AT YOU LIKE YOU HAVE LEPROSY NOBODY WANTS TO COME NEXT TO YOU NOBODY WANTS TO TALK TO YOU BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID ABOUT GETTING SICK AS WELL AS THE ALL THOSE THINGS COME INTO PLAY MESSING WITH SELF ESTEEM AND MESSING WITH- YOUR MENTAL AND YOU BEING ABLE TO CONTINUE TO BE PRODUCTIVE IN COMING OUT OF THE SITUATION- HEALTHIER THAN YOU DID WHEN YOU WENT. WENT INTO IT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS CARAWAY I WOULD NOW LIKE TO OPEN UP THE FLOOR TO ANY QUESTIONS THAT ARE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MAY HAVE FOR OUR PANELISTS. SO I'M GOING TO GO FIRST TO MISS WALDRON DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR OUR PANELISTS. YES THEY HAVE A COMMON AND THEN A QUESTION THAT BY MAY MADAM THERE YOU MAY. OKAY WELL I MEAN WE HEARD THE MOVING TESTIMONY FROM ABOVE BOTH MEN RIGHT AND THE STANEK. AND IT KIND OF. THE BEST PEOPLE WHO ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF WHAT'S GOING ON WITHIN OUR CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES ARE THOSE WHO HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN THERE AND EXPERIENCE IT FIRSTHAND. YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE MASS INCARCERATED PEOPLE. AND HAVE FELT VINDICATED FOR THAT- WE ARE A SOCIETY THAT HAS WALKED AWAY EVERY PERSON HAS THE POTENTIAL AND WE HAVE FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THE AMENITY% OF THOSE INSIDE- YOU KNOW WE HEARD WE JUST HER FIRST HAND TESTIMONY. THE SICK THE TRAUMATIZED BOTH SUFFERING. WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AND SO USE THE STORE. SO WITHOUT THEIR THEY NEED SERVICE AND MAIN HELP EDUCATION AMERICAN LESS THAT INCARCERATED- COMING HOME AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY. GOING TO BE REHABILITATED AND RESTORED SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE IT A SUCCESSFUL REENTRY AND NOT GO INTO ANOTHER LIFE OF. RECIDIVISM FINE. AND IT IS VERY TO LIGHT SOME OF THE ISSUES OF HOW WE FOR PEOPLE ON THE INSIDE WHO ARE THAT ILL OR AND THAT NEEDS OF SERVICE YOU KNOW. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE COMING BACK TO THE FULL POTENTIAL EVERYONE THERE HAS POTENTIAL AND I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE OUR MISSION- YOU KNOW AND I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR MS- EVIL- REGARDING YOU KNOW SOME OF THE PROTOCOL AND I KNOW THIS WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAME UPON US SUDDENLY AND SOME OF THESE- THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO DO WE HAVE TO LEARN ALONG THE WAY I MEAN WE ALL REMEMBER THE BEGINNING PEOPLE SAYS MATHIS AREN'T GOING TO HELP AND THEN WE HEARD MATH WILL HAVE OPEN. YOU KNOW SOCIAL DISTANCING ALWAYS CAN'T BE FOUGHT THROUGH THE AIR THAN YOU CAN SO WE LEARNED AS WE WENT WITH THIS PANDEMIC HOWEVER YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT'S BEING DONE YOU KNOWAS FAR AS STAFF AND PROTECTING STAFF AS WELL I MEAN I'M GUARD SHARING KEY EIGHT- YOU KNOW HOW DID THEY HAVE THEIR OWN OF EVERYTHING SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE SHARING THAT ARE HAND SANITIZERS READILY AVAILABLE OR ARE THOSE STILL CONSIDERED CONTRABAND- AND MOST IMPORTANTLY- PROTOCOL. DIFFER FROM PRISON TO PRISON FACILITY AND EACH WARRANT IS SETTING UP A LOT OF THE PROTOCOL FOR THEIR FACILITY AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE LEARNED IN DISCUSSIONS WITH CDC ARE OVER THE PAST FEW. MONTHS MERCEDES THE EACH FACILITY IS DIFFERENT. AND THEY ALL HAVE A DIFFERENT LAW OF LAUGHING. AND THAT'S VERY ONE OF TO ANOTHER AND THAT'S WHY EACH IN THE BASE WITH FOR THEIR OWN FACILITY AND HOW THEY MEET THE STANDARDS. SO MY QUESTION IS. HOW OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY HANDLE WHEN THE FACILITY IS DIFFERENT SO MUCH AND THEWARDENS HAVE THAT MUCH LEEWAY. WHAT MEASURES ARE YOU AND STANDARDS THAT NEED TO BE MET AND ARE WE GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE THEY'RE BEING MET. SO I'LL TRY TO YES LOOKS LIKE THERE'S QUITE A FEW QUESTIONS THERE- SO HAND SANITIZER IS AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE- STAFF IN MADE AND ANYONE THAT COMES ON GROUNDS IS THAT. WE HAVE SITTING ON THE COUNTER TOPS VERY SIMILAR TO. IT'S AVAILABLE EVERYWHERE. THEY'RE ALWAYS BANTER STATE DIRECTIVE FROM HIGHEST LAST WEEK SEAVER WHO ARE YOU ARE. DIRECTIVE OUT ALL THE ENTIRE INSTITUTION- EVERY INSTITUTIONS AND EVEN- CECERE FACILITIES THAT ARE NOT INSTITUTIONS THAT MASKS WILL BE WORN THERE IS A VERY FEW TIMES WHEN AMOUNTS CAN BE TAKEN OFF WITHIN AN INSTITUTION- BUT THAT DIRECTIVE IS IN WRITING STAFF FOR BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND WE'VE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED A MECHANISMS TO TRACK ACCOUNTABILITY OF- STAFF NOT FOLLOWING THAT DIRECTIVE WE TAKE IT AND WEARING MASKS VERY SERIOUSLY AND THE EXPECTATION IS THAT EVERYONE WEARS A MASK REGARDLESS OF CLASSIFICATION- OR WHERE THEY'RE ASSIGNED WITHIN AN INSTITUTION. GREAT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS MISS WALDRON. NO THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER COOPER DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS THAT'S WHAT I THINK THE PANELISTS FOR THEIR TIME IN THEIR COMMENTS. THANK YOU I'M- WHY DID HAVE I. WHO HAVE SO MUCH BUT I'M JUST GONNA ASK ONE. QUESTION WE'VE HEARD A LOT- ABOUT THE CLEANLINESS OF THE FACILITIES AND THE DORMITORY STYLE FACILITIES FOR WOMEN. THAT HAVING WOMEN WERE THEN ASKED TO CLEAN- SPACES THAT HAD BEEN HOUSE TO BUY OTHER- INCARCERATED WOMEN WHO HAD TESTED POSITIVE FOR COKE F IT- IT DID SEEM CONCERNING TO HEAR FOLKS SAY THAT THEY HAD THEY WERE FORCED TO USE THEIR OWN BARS OF SOAP IN THEIR SANITARY NAPKINS. TO CLEAN- THERE SPACES. SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO. WHAT CDC ARE NEEDS I MEAN IS THIS AN ISSUE OF OVERPOPULATION IS THIS ISSUE OF. NOT HAVING ENOUGH- BUDGETARY SUPPORT AND RESOURCES IS THIS AN ISSUE OF. NOT PROFICIENT OR CLARIFYING PROTOCOLS. SO I DON'T SEE IS IT BUT AS A BUSINESS BUDGETARY ISSUE WE HAVE DEPLOYED AMPLE AMOUNT OF CLEANING SUPPLIES- YEAH AND I'VE HEARD FROM MORE THAN ONE PERSON INDICATING THAT THEY'RE HAVING TO USE. THEIR OWN PERSONAL BAR SOHO AND SANITATION PADS AND- THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THIS HEARING. AND IT DEFINITELY LOOKED INTO BECAUSE WE HAVE PROVIDED A PAPER TOWELS- CELLBLOCK SIXTY FOUR- SANTA GUARD WE HAVE PROVIDED NUMEROUS CLEANING SUPPLIES TO THE INSTITUTIONS AND IF THERE'S A NEED. ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS ASK AND WE WILL FOLLOW UP I WILL PERSONALLY FOLLOW UP TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE WHAT THEY NEED- WE HAVE ALSO TAKEN A STEP FURTHER AND TREATED TRAINED ALL OF OUR BORDERS. AT A HEALTH CARE FACILITIES MAINTENANCE LEVEL OF CLEANING- SO THAT THEY KNOW HOW TO DO A TERMINAL TYPE CLEANING AND SO IF WE NEED TO EXPAND THAT WE WILL LOOK AT EXPANDING THAT BECAUSE- WE DON'T WANT THE SAME. CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HAVE BEEN SPOKE TO CONTINUE TO HAPPEN. THANK YOU. SO I WANT TO THANK ALL OF OUR PANELISTS FOR SHARING YOUR PERSONAL AND% PROFESSIONAL STORIES WITH US AND FOR ELEVATING- MANY OF THESE ISSUES WE ARE NOW GOING TO MOVE INTO THE PUBLIC COMMENT PORTION OF OUR HEARING. AS STATED AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR HEARING I WOULD ASK THAT ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC HERE IN THE ROOM PLEASE APPROACH THE MICROPHONE ONE PERSON AT A TIME.

THURGOOD DURING THE NUMBER ONE MISTER COOPER STATED THAT THERE IS A THE PEOPLE BEING RELEASED FROM PRISON AND THEN RE OFFENDING AND GOING BACK. I BELIEVE WHAT HE'S SAYING IS TRUE. HOWEVER HE LEFT OFF AN IMPORTANT THAT. LESS THAN 1% OF ALL WOMEN RELEASED FROM PRISON THE SURVEY AND END UP GOING BACK TO PRISON THAT'S THE LOWEST GROUP COMPARED TO ANY GROUP YOU WANT TO COMPARE TO RACIAL ETHNIC GENDER ANYTHING. LESS THAN 1% OF WOMEN DO ANYTHING THE WOULD FIND THEMSELVES GOING BACK TO PRISON KEEP THAT IN MIND. NUMBER TWO I WAS BUILT THE WOMEN WHO HAVE SPOKEN TODAY AND HAS SPOKEN IN THE PAST TAKEN RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR ACTIONS. IF THEY'VE BEEN IN PRISON AND NOT CRITICIZING THEM CLOSER RELATION. THE FACT IS. THE SAN WOMAN MOST WHOM. NEVER HAVE BEEN SENT TO PRISON THE FIRST PLACE THE READER FACTUALLY IN. OR THE OFFENSE'S VACANT.

GOOD AFTERNOON- ASSEMBLY MEMBER COME WATER DOWN THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HOLDING THIS COMMITTEE. MEETING TODAY- IT HAS BEEN VERY EMOTIONAL TESTIMONY THAT I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT WE HAVE HEARD- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE NOTE OF IT IS THAT WE HAVE THESE WOMEN'S FACILITIES THAT ARE FULL OF AGING AND ELDERLY WOMEN BUT ALSO WE HAVE A LOT OF WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN WRONGFULLY CONVICTED. WE HAVE WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF DIFFERENT FORMS OF VIOLENCE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHO ARE NOW FINDING THEMSELVES INCARCERATED FOR EITHER BEING DIRECTLY INVOLVED WHEN A CRIME RELATED TO THEIR ABUSER HAVING KILLED THEIR ABUSER OR SOME FORM OFRETRIBUTIVE TYPE JUSTICE THAT THEY HAD TO EXERCISE- I THINK THAT WE ARE DOING A DISSERVICE. TO THESE WOMEN BY CONTINUING TO KEEP THEM INCARCERATED- IT WAS. TRAUMATIC JUST HEARING I AM NOT FORMALLY INCARCERATED BUT IS DRAMATIC HEARING THE TESTIMONY OF THESE WOMEN'S- AS I LOOKED AT MISS PRICE- SHE REMINDED ME SO MUCH OF MY OWN GRANDMOTHER- AND THIS IS JUST THIS IS INHUMANE THIS IS CRUEL FOR WOMEN TO- HAVE TO USE THEIR SANITARY NAPKINS IN ORDER TO CLEAN. THE ROOMS THAT THEY'RE IN IS JUST IT'S ABSOLUTELY APPALLING AND SO I TOO AM HERE TO ASK GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM- AS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT DOING MASS RELEASES AT SAN QUENTIN- OFTEN TIMES WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM- IT IS SOLELY FOCUSED ON THE MALE POPULATION AND THE WOMEN'S POPULATIONS HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN. SO I AM ASKING THAT THE GOVERNOR BEGAN TO LOOK AT RELEASING THESE WOMEN AS WELL A WOMAN IN HER SIXTY SEVENTY EIGHTY YEARS OLD WAS SUFFERING FROM DEBILITATING HEALTH CARE CHRONIC ISSUES IS NO LONGER A THREAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT I TOO SO MY GRANDMOTHER AND MY MOTHER IN THE TESTIMONY OF MISS RIGHT. WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO THE PHONE NOW MY- PLEASE A THE LINE FOR THE NEXT WITNESS METAL CAROLINE THIRTY TWO CLEVELAND HAD. HI THANK YOU ALL FOR SENDING THE TIME ON THIS HELLO MY NAME IS DIANA BLOCK- I'M WITH THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR WOMEN PRISONERS I SO APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY FROM ALL THE UP FORMERLY INCARCERATED WOMEN IN PARTICULAR AND PUT THE TIME THAT BEING SPENT- HEARING IT I THINK THE CRITICAL THING I MEAN MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE COMMENTED HAVE MADE THE POINT THAT ABOUT THE NEED FOR RELEASES THAT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. THE AT THE OTHER PIECE THAT I REALLY WANT TO STRESS IS THAT WITHOUT SOME ACCESS OR PEOPLE INSIDE PRISON FOR PEOPLE TO DIRECTLY HEAR FROM THEM THEN YOU WILL ONLY GET THE OFFICIAL STORY THE CDC ARE STORY WHICH IS NOT. WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING WE INCREASE THE W. P. HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC THE KIND OF CONDITIONS THAT- PATRICIA RIGHT YANNICK CARAWAY OTHERS HAVE TESTIFIED ABOUT. DONE UP BUT NO. ONE IS LISTENING. NOTHING HAS CHANGED IT EASY SOMEONE TO SAY THAT WILL ALL WORK O GO IN THE MALL WE'RE GOING TO MAKE ALL THESE CHANGES. BUT WHERE IS THE OLD WHO IS GOING TO SEE WHETHER THOSE CHANGES ARE ACTUALLY BEING MADE. I URGE YOU PLEASE MADAM CHAIR. FIGURE OUT HOW TO ACTUALLY FOLLOW UP ON EVERYTHING YOU'VE HEARD TODAY AND VERIFY THAT THE THINGS THAT ARE BEING FED. BY CDC R. OFFICIALS ARE ACTUALLY TRUE BECAUSE IF YOU GO AND VERIFY YOU'LL SEE THAT IT'S NOT AND THEN IN FACT THE PARABLE. CONDITIONS OF QUARANTINE OF HAVING TO USE A SANITARY PAD FOR CLEANING IS WHAT THE NORM HAS BEEN. SO THAT IS THAT IS REALLY WHAT I HOPE THAT CAN BE TAKEN AWAY FROM THIS. BESIDES ALL THE INCREDIBLE POINTS AND THEN MADE BY INDIVIDUALS IN THE NEED FOR VERIFICATION. BY AN OUTSIDE BODY BESIDES CDC ARE BECAUSE- AS PEOPLE HAVE SAID T. V. C. R. CANNOT POLICE ITSELF IT CANNOT BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND WE NEED A DIFFERENT METHOD. IN ORDER TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE LIVING UNDER DIFFERENT CONDITIONS AND THAT MOST IMPORTANTLY THE PEOPLE WHO NEED TO BE RELEASED. GET RELIEF SOON THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE NEXT WITNESS ON THE LINE AND I'M GOING TO ASK THAT ARE WITNESSES- EXERCISE SOME BREVITY SO THAT WE CAN MAINTAIN OUR OUR STOP TIME. MODERATOR. OPEN THE LINE FOR THE NEXT WITNESS. TERREL NEXTCODE ALIGNED TWENTY SEVEN PLEASE GLAD. LINE TWENTY SEVEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN. MAXIMO CAROLINE THIRTY SEVEN PLEASE GO AHEAD.

I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT I CAN BE HEARD YOU CAN WE CAN HEAR YOU BUT I CAN BE SEEN AND YOU SAID TWO PM DOES THAT GIVE ME THE FOUR MINUTES RIGHT CERTAINLY USE IT. WELL I'D LIKE TO PROVIDE PREP CLOSING REMARKS IF YOU DON'T MIND ALREADY- I ACTUALLY JUST WANT TO OFFER A LITTLE BIT OF- SOMETHING FROM. ST FRANCIS OF ASSISI. GRANT THAT I MAY NOT SO MUCH SEEK TO BE CONSOLEDAS TO CONSOLE. TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS TO UNDERSTAND. TO BE LOVED AS TO LOVE FOR IT IS IN THE GIVING THAT WE RECEIVE. AND ANOTHER LITTLE BIT OF A POEM THAT MATTERS TO ME. LIFE IS MOSTLY FROTH AND BUBBLE TWO THINGS STAND LIKE STONE. KINDNESS IN ANOTHER'S TROUBLE COURAGE IN YOUR OWN AND I'LL GIVE THAT CREDIT TO ADAM LINDSAY GORDON. EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE TO EIGHTEEN SEVENTY. AND IF I DO HAVE ANOTHER MOMENT. IT'S GOING TO TAKE ME AWHILE TO PROCESS THIS HEARING THIS IS THIS IS A REALLY BIG TOPIC AND I'M NOT AT ALL- SAYING WHAT I ANTICIPATED I'D BE SAYING BUT IN THE SPIRIT OF WHAT THAT OTHER COMMENTER SAID- THAT WAS OUTSIDE AT ONE OF THOSE STATIONS. SOMETHING THAT HAD BEEN IN MY MIND WHEN I WAS RUSHING OVER HERE WAS THIS NOTION OF PREGNANT WOMEN- I HAVE FOUR CHILDREN- I'VE BEEN PREGNANT- NINE TIMES A LOT OF PREGNANCY LOSS. AND THE THOUGHT OF THESE WOMEN BEING PREGNANT AND BEING SUBJECTED TO THESE CONDITIONS THAT YOU KNOW THESE ACT EXPERT WITH WITNESSES HAVE. DESCRIBED IT'S OF DEEP CONCERN TO ME. AND MAYBE FOR DIFFERENT REASONS THAN THE- GENTLEMAN THAT GAVE WITNESS EARLIER WAS SPEAKING OF BUT BUT THE SAME TOPIC OF THE BABIES AND- THE VACCINES. AND THESE KINDS OF THINGS. SO I JUST WANTED TO READ SOMETHING THAT- ALSO MATTERS TO ME. CALLED THE. NASCO. UNIVERSAL DECLARATION ON BIOETHICS AND HUMAN RIGHTS WHICH WAS ADOPTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE ON BEHALF OF A GLOBAL CONSENSUS AND IT INVOLVED ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY THREE COUNTRIES INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES. ARTICLE SIX ONE TALKS ABOUT CONSENT. AND IT DECLARES THAT ANY PREVENTATIVE DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICAL INTERVENTION IS ONLY TO BE CARRIED OUT WITH THE PRIOR FREE AND INFORMED CONSENT OF THE PERSON CONCERNED BASED ON ADEQUATE INFORMATION. THE CONSENT SHOULD WHERE APPROPRIATE BE EXPRESS AND MAY BE WITHDRAWN BY THE PERSON CONCERNED AT ANY TIME AND FOR ANY REASON WITHOUT DISADVANTAGED OR PREJUDICE AND I WOULD HOPE THAT THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE PROTECTING. INCARCERATED WOMEN. HE KILLED EARLY PREGNANT WOMEN WHO ARE INCARCERATED BECAUSE- THERE IS JUST SIMPLY NO MORE IMPORTANT. HUMAN RIGHTS THEN THE RIGHT TO CONTROL. WHAT IS INJECTED INTO OUR BODIES A WHAT IS PUT IN OUR BODIES- IN MY POINT OF VIEW AND AGAIN SO MUCH FOR THAT IN THE INTEREST OF BREVITY I HAVE THREE MORE LITTLE LINES AND ALL BE DONE SO IT'S TWO O'CLOCK RIGHT NOW OKAY JUST IT'S LIKE THIRTY SECONDS OKAY I HAVE MY WATCH THE AVIS BROTHERS IT'S FROM A SONG CALLED FEBRUARY SEVEN. I WENT ON THE SEARCH FOR SOMETHING REAL TRADED WHAT I KNOW FOR HOW I FEEL. BUT THE CEILING AND THE WALLS COLLAPSED UPON THE DARKNESS I WAS TRAPPED AND AS THE LAST OF BREATH WAS DRAWN FROM ME. THE LIGHT BROKE IN AND BROUGHT ME TO MY FEET. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU SO WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION AND FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO LISTEN. I TOOK A NUMBER OF NOTES DURING THE COURSE OF THIS HEARING I WANNA RAISE UP THE NAME MADONNA WATSON WHO DIED WHILE INCARCERATED. I WANT TO. REITERATE THE CHALLENGES WE'VE HEARD AROUND SAFETY PROTOCOLS BOTH FOR THOSE WHO ARE INCARCERATED IN LIVING BEHIND BARS AND THOSE WHO ARE ACTUALLY WORKING IN THE SYSTEMS. I WAS JUST REFLECTING DURING THIS HEARING ABOUT JUSTIN TURNER WHO WAS PART OF A TEAM THAT WON THE WORLD SERIES THIS WAS A PERSON WHO TESTED POSITIVE FOR COVE IT WAS TAKEN OFF THE FIELD WITH ALL KINDS OF TELEVISION CAMERAS WATCHING HIM AND HE STILL SOMEHOW ENDED UP BACK ON THE FIELD WITHOUT WEARING A MASK SO IF THAT CAN HAPPEN WITH SOMEONE WITH. ALL KINDS OF TELEVISION CAMERAS ON HIM WHAT'S GOING ON IN SPACES WHERE WE DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF VISIBILITY. MENTAL HEALTH HAS SOMETHING THAT HAS CONTINUED TO COME UP- HOW WE DEAL WITH OUR PRISON REDUCTION. AND A PLEA TO MR GOVERNOR ON BEHALF OF MISS RIGHT AND OTHERS TO REALLY. EXAMINE THE LIST OF ELIGIBLE WOMEN WHO SHOULD NOT BE DYING OR AGING BEHIND BARS. AND WE WILL BE DOING A FOLLOW UP ON SOME THINGS THAT I HEARD THAT I WOULD BE HOPING FOR MORE CLARITY ON I WROTE DOWN. GPS MONITORING AND TRACKING BECAUSE I FELT LIKE I HEARD SOME STATEMENTS FROM. OUR STE IT WAS STAFF AT CDC ARE ABOUT HOW WE'RE SORT OF MONITORING- HOW FOLKS ARE MOVING- AND SO WE WOULD LOVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON THAT- WE DON'T WANT OUR PRISONS TO BECOME FACTORIES OF DESPAIR. OR DEATH. AND IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE FIND WAYS TO DO CAR STRAIGHT WOMEN AND SUPPORT THE HAGUE DIGNITY AND HEALTH OF THOSE WHO ARE BEHIND BARS AND THOSE WHO ARE WORKING IN THOSE SYSTEMS. I SPEAK FOR ALL OF US WHEN I SAY THAT WE ARE HUMBLED AND WE ARE GRATEFUL TO ALL OF THOSE WHO BRAVE TODAY TO SHARE THEIR TESTIMONY AND THEIR WORK I DO APPRECIATE YOU AND HOE YOU CONSIDER ME AS A PARTNER. WITH THAT WE WILL OFFICIALLY CONCLUDE THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON HEARING ON INCARCERATED
