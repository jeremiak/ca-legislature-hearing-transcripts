YEARS AGO IN ORDER TO SUPPORT

00:49:43.547 --> 00:49:45.515
THE PUBLIC POLICY OF ENHANCING

OF INCLUDING SOLAR IN PEOPLE'S

00:49:48.151 --> 00:49:49.586

00:49:49.653 --> 00:49:51.355
THEM TO SAY THAT THAT SUCH AS

00:49:51.421 --> 00:49:53.757
SOLAR. INCREASE WITH DR SORRY

00:49:53.824 --> 00:49:55.392
INCLUSION INTO THE PROPERTY

00:49:55.459 --> 00:49:59.329
WOULD NOT BE. A TAXABLE EVENT

00:49:59.396 --> 00:49:59.963
THAT WOULD ADD TO YOUR ASSESSED

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:01.932
VALUATION. CHALLENGE THAT WE

00:50:01.998 --> 00:50:03.700
FACE IN THE PRACTICAL REALITY

00:50:03.767 --> 00:50:05.836
OF IMPLEMENTATION IS. THAT THE

00:50:05.902 --> 00:50:07.871
WAY MANY OF THESE COMPANIES

00:50:07.938 --> 00:50:10.974

00:50:17.914 --> 00:50:20.550
THE ECONOMIC MODELS TO. ALLOW

00:50:20.617 --> 00:50:22.786
FOR THE STUFF TO WORK AND SO

00:50:22.853 --> 00:50:24.287
THIS BILL CLARIFIES ANY

00:50:24.354 --> 00:50:26.590
CONFUSION IN THAT REGARD THAT

00:50:26.656 --> 00:50:27.958
ON THE ONE HAND SUPPORTS THE

00:50:28.024 --> 00:50:30.460
POLICY THAT SAYS IF YOU WANT TO

00:50:30.527 --> 00:50:31.862
ADD SOLAR TO YOUR HOME IT

00:50:31.928 --> 00:50:33.130
SHOULD NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE

00:50:33.196 --> 00:50:35.198
ASSESSED VALUATION. AND THE

00:50:35.265 --> 00:50:37.634
OTHER HAND AVOIDS THE CONFUSION

00:50:37.701 --> 00:50:38.935
THAT'S CREATED BY WHAT'S CALLED

00:50:39.002 --> 00:50:40.937
THESE PARTNERSHIP FLIPS- IN

00:50:41.004 --> 00:50:42.973
ESSENCE WHERE OWNERSHIP SHIFTS

00:50:43.039 --> 00:50:44.741
FROM ONE TO ANOTHER BASED UPON

00:50:44.808 --> 00:50:46.009
YOUR PAYMENTS NOW YOUR HISTORY

MECHANISM THAT THE MARKET USES

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:51.314
THAT PUTS LESS PRESSURE ON

00:50:51.381 --> 00:50:52.549
PEOPLE WHEN THEY COME AND

00:50:52.616 --> 00:50:54.518
INSTALL A SOLAR INTO THEIR

WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

00:50:57.921 --> 00:50:58.588
UNDERLYING PURPOSE OF THE

00:51:00.957 --> 00:51:02.959
IMPEDED BY A STRAINED

00:51:03.026 --> 00:51:04.961
INTERPRETATION OF HOW WE
