FOR THREE MINUTES IN TOTAL FOR WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] GREAT. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN I THANK YOU AND THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING. WITH US ON THE BILL -- REGARDING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS -- WE WILL -- EXCEPT THOSE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS -- I DO WANT TO KNOW AS CHAIR AND I HAVE DISCUSSED -- THAT THERE IS SOME INTERACTION BETWEEN THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS -- AND THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE PLACED IN THE BILL BY THE SENATE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS. I COMMITTEE -- AND THOSE WILL NEED TO BE IRONED OUT SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME THAT BOTH COMMITTEES BE SATISFIED -- WITH THE BILL -- SO AS CHAIR AND I DISCUSSED -- GOING FORWARD -- I I WILL WOULD LIKE TO TRY TO CONVENE I HAVE BOTH KIDNEYS WORK TOGETHER WITH ME -- AND FIGURE THIS OUT BEFORE THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE BUT WE ARE -- ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ARE TODAY. I THANK YOU -- COLLEAGUES ARE SENATE BILL -- ONE FIFTY NINE WILL HELP US EXPAND ACCESS TO TWO VERY POWERFUL ANTI -- IT -- IT -- HIV PROFOUND AS EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS AND POST EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS OR PROP IMPACT. OUR PRACTICE IS A ONCE A DAY PILL THAT ARE REDUCES RISK OF HIV INFECTION BY AS MUCH AS 99% -- AND PAT IS A A TWENTY EIGHT DAY COURSE -- FOR WHEN A AND SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE BELIEVES THAT THEY'VE BEEN EXPOSED OR HAS POTENTIALLY BEEN EXPOSED TO HIV -- VIS -- TOOLS ARE ESSENTIAL -- IN OUR EFFORT TO AND INSIDE B. -- INFECTIONS ON UNFORTUNATELY -- THE UPTAKE OF PROP IN PARTICULAR -- HAS BEEN NOT WHAT WE WANT PARTICULARLY IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR -- BUT REALLY OUTSIDE OF OUR METROPOLITAN AREAS AND WE ARE STILL SEEING PEOPLE GET INFECTED AND THERE ARE MANY MANY PEOPLE -- IN CALIFORNIA WHO COULD BENEFIT FROM PROP WHO ARE NOT ON IT AND THERE ARE VARIOUS BARRIERS -- TO PROP ON AND WE ARE ADDRESSING TWO OF THEM IN THIS BILL -- THE FIRST IS THAT. THERE ARE STILL INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT ARE REQUIRING PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS FOR PROP. AND FOR PAP -- IT FOR PEPPERS PARTICULARLY OUTRAGEOUS WHEN THIS HAPPENS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO GO ON THE POP WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS OF EXPOSURE -- IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE A FACTOR -- AND WE'VE HAD SITUATIONS WHERE INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE -- REQUIRED PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS FOR THAT SEVENTY TWO HOUR PERIOD WHICH IS OUTRAGEOUS -- BUT FOR PROP AS WELL -- WHEN SOMEONE IS AT RISK -- THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET ACCESS TO PROP. QUICKLY AND NOT HAVE TO WAIT TIMES A MONTH FOR A PRIOR AUTHORIZATION SO THE BILL WILL BAN PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS FOR PROBLEM TOP -- THE OTHER -- BARRIER THAT THE BILL ADDRESSES IS IN TERMS OF HOW TO ACCESS THE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS WHO CAN PROVIDE. A PROP AND TOP -- AND RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH A POSITION -- WHEN I WENT ON THE PROJECT I WENT THROUGH MY POSITION AND IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE AND A VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE AND NON JUDGMENTAL POSITION? UNFORTUNATELY NOT EVERYONE HAS THE SAME EXPERIENCE -- ALTHOUGH MANY DOCTORS ARE INCREDIBLY GOOD ABOUT TALKING ABOUT ALL AND ADDRESSING SEXUAL HEALTH THERE ARE STILL PHYSICIANS WHO ARE NOT AND WE STILL HEAR STORIES OF PATIENTS. TO GO TO SEE THE DOCTOR AND ASK FOR PROP -- AND AND THE RESPONSE IS -- JUDGMENTS AND TRYING TO ARGUE WITH THEM AND AND THEN THEY'VE COURSES SHRINK INTO A CALL AND GO AWAY AND AND I'M NOT GOING ON THE PROP. IN ADDITION WE HAVE A PHYSICIAN SHORTAGE AND IT IS STILL COMMON FOR PEOPLE TO STRUGGLE -- TO GET AN APPOINTMENT IT COULD TAKE WEEKS OR MONTHS TO GET AN APPOINTMENT AND WHEN PEOPLE ARE RESTING NEED ACCESS NOW -- SO THE BILL WILL ALLOW -- PHARMACISTS -- TO PROVIDE PROP OR PATH WITHOUT A PHYSICIAN'S US A PRESCRIPTION IN THE CASE OF OUR PRODUCT THE PHARMACIST UNDER THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE FIRST SIXTY DAYS WORTH -- AND THEN THERE AFTER A PERSON WILL HAVE TO GO INTO A PHYSICIAN'S CARE AND GET THE REQUIRED BLOOD WORK AND SO FORTH I SAID THIS BILL WITH RESPECT TO PROP DOES NOT CUT POSITIONS OUT. ASSEMBLY ALLOWS SOMEONE TO QUICKLY GO TO THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD PHARMACY THE PHARMACIST WILL HAVE TO RECEIVE TRAINING -- GET STARTED -- AND THEN AFTER A PERIOD OF TIME ENTER A PHYSICIAN'S CARE -- TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE. SO WE THINK THAT THE BILL -- STRIKES THE RIGHT BALANCE -- WE HAVE BROAD SUPPORT -- FROM -- FROM THE HIV ADVOCACY COMMUNITY EVERY CREDIBLE HIV ORGANIZATION IS SUPPORTING -- THIS BILL -- AS WELL AS MANY OTHERS -- AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. NOW WITH ME TODAY -- OR FEW WITNESSES CAROLINE -- TO WITH UCSF -- POSITION WITH YOU SEE US OFF -- CRAIG PULLS OVER WITH A PL A HEALTH. I COULD HAWKINS OF PHARMACISTS WITHOUT WHICH THE PHARMACY. AND ALSO WITH US TODAY IT'S TAMMY MARTIN -- WITH THE QUALITY CALIFORNIA THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AGAIN WE WILL ALLOW UP TO THREE MINUTES IN TOTAL SO I SEE THAT THERE ARE FOUR DIVISIONS PERHAPS YOU CAN. BE AS CONCISE AS POSSIBLE PLEASE FEEL FREE TO PRESENT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S -- I GET THE DISTINGUISHED ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MY NAME IS DOCTOR CAROLYN TO AN HIV SPECIALIST PHYSICIAN IN SAN FRANCISCO AND THE CLINICAL DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL PREP LINE AND PIPELINE. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. TWO WEEKS AGO THE U. S. PREVENTIVE SERVICES TASK FORCE K. PREP A GRADE A RATING ITS HIGHEST. BASING THE RECOMMENDATION ON AN IN DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS AND HARMS A PREP AS WELL AS A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE BALANCE OF EVIDENCE. IN SHORT THE TASK FORCE CONCLUDED WITH HIGH CERTAINTY THAT THE NET BENEFIT A PREP TO REDUCE THE RISK OF HIV FOR THOSE AT ELEVATED RISK IS SUBSTANTIAL. SB ONE FIVE NINE IF ENACTED COULD HELP CALIFORNIA MAKE EXTRAORDINARY STRIDES TO SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVE TIMELY ACCESS TO PREP AND PAT FOR THE THOUSANDS OF ITS RESIDENTS WHO ARE AT RISK FOR HIV. PHARMACISTS ARE AN INTEGRAL COMPONENT OF OUR STATE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM AS THEY ARE HIGHLY TRAINED CLINICAL PROFESSIONALS WHO HOLDEN UNPARALLELED UNDERSTANDING OF PHARMACOTHERAPY EASE. PHARMACISTS ARE ALSO A TRUSTED CORNERSTONE FOR HIGH QUALITY PATIENT SERVICES IN ALMOST EVERY COMMUNITY IN OUR STATE. THEY ARE OFTEN A SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT WELL CONNECTED TO A PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER AND CAN ALSO BE AN EFFECTIVE MEANS OF LINKING SOMEONE TO CARE. I RESPECTFULLY URGE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO VOTE YES TO PROVE TIMELY ACCESS TO TWO HIGHLY EFFECTIVE SAFE HIV PREVENTION INTERVENTIONS FOR PERSONS WHO ARE MOST IN NEED. THIS WILL HELP ADVANCE MORE PATIENT CENTERED INTEGRATED AND EFFICIENT HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR CALIFORNIA THAT WILL HOPEFULLY MOVE THE DIAL ON ENDING THIS EPIDEMIC. A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- LIKE CENTER WIENER SAID WE NOW HAVE DAILY MEDICATIONS THAT CAN PREVENT HIV YEAH WE STILL HAVE NEARLY FIVE THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS TO ACQUIRE HIV EVERY YEAR. PERHAPS HAS BEEN APPROVED FOR NEARLY SEVEN YEARS AND STILL LESS THAN 20% OF PEOPLE WHO COULD BENEFIT FROM THE MEDICATIONS ARE CURRENTLY TAKING THAT. CLEAR CLEARLY WHAT WE ARE DOING NOW IS NOT WORKING WE NEED A BOLD AND INNOVATIVE POLICY SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THESE BARRIERS AND PUT THESE MEDICATIONS IN THE HANDS WHO NEED THE MOST. AND THAT'S WHY SB ONE FIVE NINE IS THE FIRST IN THE NATION BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW PHARMACISTS TO FURNISH PAP AND A LIMITED COURSE OF PREP WITHOUT A DOCTOR'S PRESCRIPTION. SIMILAR TO WHAT IT WHAT IS ALREADY BEING DONE FOR THE LOCKS ON BIRTH CONTROL AND OTHER IMPORTANT MEDICATIONS. THE BILL HAS BEEN CAREFULLY CRAFTED TO PROTECT PATIENT SAFETY AND ENSURE THAT CDC GUIDELINES ARE FOLLOWED. AND ENJOYS BROAD SUPPORT FROM PHYSICIANS AND HIV SPECIALISTS PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT SPECIALIZE IN GOOD PROPER CARE. SB ONE FIVE NINE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO BE A LEADER AND EXPANDING ACCESS TO THESE LIFESAVING MEDICATIONS AND I OR DRIVE A MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBER SIGN DOCTOR KLEIN HOPKINS PHARMACIST OWNER OF BUSH'S PHARMACY WHICH HAS BEEN PART OF THE SACRAMENTO COMMUNITY SINCE. NINETEEN THIRTY THIS PHARMACY IS BEEN FOCUSED ON THE HEALTH AND WELLNESS OF SACRAMENTO RESIDENTS FOR NEARLY NINETY YEARS WE KNOW OUR PATIENTS AND FAMILY MEMBERS BY NAME. IT IS HEARTBREAKING FOR ME TO DISCUSS HIV MEDICATIONS WITH A NEWLY DIAGNOSED PERSON WHEN I KNOW THAT THERE'S MEDICATION AVAILABLE IN THE FORM OF CRAP WHICH COULD HAVE PREVENTED THEIR INFECTION OR PAT. WHICH COULD HAVE STOPPED IT AFTER THEY WERE EXPOSED THEY JUST DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO IT WHEN THEY NEEDED IT. SB ONE FIFTY NINE BUILDS UPON GAINES CALIFORNIA HAS MADE TO INCREASE THE AVAIL THE AVAILABILITY. OF PREVENTATIVE MEDICATIONS AND PRODUCTS TO PATIENTS BY ALLOWING PHARMACISTS TO FURNISH IN LIMITED QUANTITIES MEDICATIONS PROVEN TO REDUCE THE SPREAD OF HIV AND AIDS. SB ONE FIFTY NINE WILL ALSO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF HIV TESTING SITES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THERE BY EMPOWERING OUR CITIZENS WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR HIV STATUS. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH DON'T. THINK YOU AND YOU JUST CAN WE SUMMARIZE SHIRT TAMMY MARTIN ON BEHALF OF EQUALITY CALIFORNIA PROUD COSPONSOR OF THE BILL -- HIGH PRIORITY FOR US AS PART OF OUR ON GOING HIV PREVENTION WORK IT'S A CRITICAL PUBLIC HEALTH BILL AND WE RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH TIME. THIS NO WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT NAME AND AFFILIATION IF YOU WISH TO DO SO. THE FIRST NIGHT ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION AND THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CHAIN DRUG STORES WE'RE SUPPORT WE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS BUT DO LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS. WE THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME CLARITY I WITH RESPECT TO OVERALL PATIENT ACCESS TO PREP AND PERHAPS EVEN ONCE THEY LEAVE AND ARE NO LONGER ABLE TO ACCESS THE PHARMACIST DIRECTLY -- AND THEN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S COVERAGE FOR THAT AND SOME OF THE NEW AMENDMENTS WE CONTINUE TO WANT TO WORK ON SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR BETTER IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU.

SO WE DO SUPPORT PHARMACIST BEING ABLE TO DISPENSE PAP AS WILL INCREASE ACCESS WHICH IS IMPORTANT HOWEVER THE BOARD BELIEVES THAT PREP BECAUSE IT REQUIRES REGULAR MONITORING TESTING HERE INSTEAD IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR PHARMACIST TO INITIATE PROP. WE DID HAVE A REQUEST AMENDMENTS REGARDING PROTOCOLS BUT I BELIEVE THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ADDRESS THAT ISSUE AND I KNOW THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ALSO DO LIMIT PROP SO HAVE TO TAKE THIS A BILL BACK TO OUR BOARD ARE MORE BEING AUGUST BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. ON THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT CNN NOW WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COME UP TO THE TABLE HERE.

AS CHAIR. MISTER MEMBERS RAND MARTIN -- ON BEHALF OF ANOTHER CREDIBLE AIDS ORGANIZATION THE H. HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION THE LARGEST PROVIDER OF CARE AND TREATMENT OF PEOPLE WITH HIV AND AIDS IN THE WORLD WITH ONE POINT FOUR MILLION. PATIENTS IN FORTY THREE COUNTRIES -- WE WE SHARE THE SENATOR CONCERNS ABOUT PRESS. I'M WE ARE A LARGE PREP PROVIDER IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE THE LARGEST PROVIDER IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA WITH THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS. WE KNOW WHAT IT TAKES TO GET PEOPLE INTO PREP AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY STAY ON PRESS -- WE ARE WE ARE HAVE BEEN HAVE EXPRESSED SOME CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER THE CLINICAL GUIDELINES THAT ARE PART OF PREP -- ARE ACCURATELY DEALT WITH IN THIS BILL WE THINK THE SENATOR HAS MADE PROGRESS IN THAT REGARD. NO ONE'S BEEN TIME N THAT TODAY BECAUSE I LOOK FOR TO SEE WITH YOU MEMBERS LOOK LIKE. WE ARE VERY TROUBLED ABOUT THE CONTEXT IN WHICH PREP WOULD BE PROVIDED TO A PATIENT. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX I WAS THE FOUNDING EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE LIFE IT'S A LOT OF LIFE WHICH IS MADE UP A LOT OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM. FOUGHT VERY HARD ON A NUMBER OF POLICY ISSUES IN THE LATE EIGHTIES ONE OF WHICH WAS HIV TESTING BEING PROTECTED. PRIVACY FOR THE PATIENTS. DID NOT WANT PEOPLE EXPOSED THAT THEIR HIV STATUS WAS EXPOSED BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT THE IMPACT WAS GOING TO BE. WE FOUGHT VERY HARD FOR THAT. WE WERE SUCCESSFUL WE HAVE VERY STRONG LOS. THEIR CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR MALICIOUSLY DISCLOSING AN HIV. TEST RESULT OR CIVIL PENALTIES -- FOR FOR VIOLATING -- THAT DISCLOSURE PROVISION -- THERE ARE PROVISIONS RELATIVE TO PUTTING AN HIV TEST RESULT IN THE MEDICAL IN A SEPARATE ENVELOPE IN THE MEDICAL RECORD. IN IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY. SO NOW WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WALKING INTO A PHARMACY. A WALGREENS OR CVS. AT A FIFTEEN FOOT COUNTER. THERE ARE TEN PEOPLE STANDING IN LINE WAITING TO GET A PRESCRIPTION. SIX PEOPLE BEHIND YOU GETTING TOOTHPASTE IN THE AISLE BEHIND YOU. THE PHARMACIST AND THE PATIENT ARE EXPECTED TO DISCUSS THEIR HIV TEST RESULTS. IN THAT PLACE. THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE TESTED DISCUSSING THEIR SEXUAL HISTORY IN THAT PLACE. IT'S THE WRONG PLACE TO DO IT. THERE ARE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO PREP THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. AND THERE ARE SOLUTIONS THAT DO NOT PUT PRIVACY AT RISK FOR PEOPLE WITH HIV. WE WE ASK YOU TO THINK ABOUT YOURSELVES WALKING UP TO YOUR CVS COUNTER. AND WHETHER YOU WOULD PERSONALLY. FEEL COMFORTABLE TALKING ABOUT AN HIV TEST FOR YOUR SEXUAL HEALTH. TO A PHARMACIST IN THAT KIND OF ENVIRONMENT -- FOR THOSE REASONS I WOKE I'M GETTING A LITTLE EMOTIONAL BECAUSE I'VE FOUGHT THIS THIRTY YEARS AGO AND I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT AGAIN -- I ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE ON THE BILL AT THIS POINT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PLEASE FEEL FREE TO STATE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION IF YOU WISH TO DO SO. SURE MORGAN CAR ALL WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WE REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT I THE SENATOR IS DONE AS WELL AS THE COMMITTEE HAS DONE. I THINK THAT THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN ARE VERY THOUGHTFUL AND LOOK FORWARD TO READING THEM AND PRINT -- WHERE WE CAN RECONSIDER POSITION THANK YOU? BRENT SPENCE WITH AMERICAN COLLEGE OBGYN SIMILAR TO CMA WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR AND THE COMMITTEE WE'RE GONNA MINUTES WE LOOK FOR LOOKING AT THEM TO PRINT NO RECESS OPPOSITION AFTER. WE SEE THEM THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS TO MAD REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF MERCY SOLUTIONS WERE IN THE SAME SITUATION AS THE PREVIOUS TWO SPEAKERS WOULD FORWARD TO REVIEWING THE AMENDMENTS AND CONTAIN A WORK THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THERESA START WITH KAISER PERMANENTE A WE DID HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL WITH SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE PREP PROVISIONS THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF GREAT WORK HAS GONE INTO THAT AND WE WILL BE HAPPY TO TO REVIEW THE AMENDMENTS -- I DID WANT TO POINT OUTTWO QUICK THINGS KAISER PERMANENT IS STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF EXPANDING ACCESS TO PEPIN PREP WE HAVE PROGRAMS IN OUR OWN PHARMACIES -- FOR THIS EXACT PURPOSE SO WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE AMENDMENTS DO NOT. UNINTENTIONALLY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THOSE PROGRAMS THAT ARE VERY SUCCESSFUL SINCE THERE SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S SOME NEW REQUIREMENTS FOR PHARMACY STILL WANT TO LOOK AT THAT. AND THEN FINALLY THE THE NEW COVERAGE LANGUAGE -- TO GET AT THE TO VISITLIMIT TO ENSURE THAT THAT PLANS WILL ONLY BE COVERING -- THIS FOR SIXTY DAYS AND THEN I KNOW THE PURPOSE IS TO DRIVE THAT PATIENT THAN TO CARE AND WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THAT THAT'S WORKABLE AND DOESN'T AND INTENTIONALLY CREATE -- YOU KNOW A BUMPY ROAD FOR THE PATIENT AND HOW THAT WORKS BEHIND THE SCENES I THINK THERE'S SOME NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT LANGUAGE WORK SO THERE'S NOT A DISCONTINUATION OF COVERAGE AND OTHER COMPLEXITIES FOR THE PATIENT THERE SO. I KNOW THE PLANS WILL BE INTERESTED IN REVIEWING THAT LANGUAGE AS WELL AND HOPEFULLY CAN WORK WITH YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE THEN BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. AT THIS TIME TO BEGIN WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER GLORIA. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU SENATOR WINNER OF FOR BRING THIS BILL BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE I AM PROUD TO BE A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR -- WITH -- MISTER GIBSON ON THE SUPPORT PIECE OF LEGISLATION -- I WANTED KNOWLEDGE THEY MISSED THAT YOU TAKEN TO MOVE -- THE BILL I THINK IN WHAT IS GENERALLY POSITIVE DIRECTION AS A NOTED OF ABOUT MY COLLEAGUES ON THE COMMITTEE BY THE SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION WHO -- I THINK WE'LL PROBABLY INVOLVED IN THEIR POSITION AFTER ABLE TO TAKE A LOOK. MORE CLOSELY AT THIS ALSO WANT A KNOWLEDGE OF THE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION BETWEEN DIFFERENT COMMITTEE CHAIRS -- WHICH IS A FUNCTION OF YOUR POSITION I THINK WE WE HAVE TO DO IS KEEP THIS BILL MOVING FORWARD AND I HOPE THAT EVERY MEMBER OF THIS LEGISLATURE -- WILL BE COMMITTED TO DOING THAT -- EN MASSE IT WOULD JUST OBSERVE A REAL IDENTIFICATION WITH THE PERSONAL -- COMMENTS THAT YOU SHARED WITH THE COMMITTEE -- WHETHER THROUGH PERSONAL EXPERIENCE A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE OF CLOSE FRIENDS -- THERE IS A PROBLEM HERE THAT THIS LEGISLATURE CAN HELP FIX AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO DO -- THERE'S BEEN X. OUTSTANDING REPORTING LAST MONTH OR SO NOT JUST ABOUT THE ORIGINS OF THIS MEDICATION -- WHICH IS THAT WE ALL PAID FOR ITS CREATION -- BUT THE LACK OF ACCESS TO IT THAT IS HAPPENING IN THE REALLY SORT OF COLLECTIVE ANGER WE SHOULD HAVE IT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE NOT COME FURTHER -- IN IN STOPPING NEW INFECTIONS AND GIVING PEOPLE THE TOOLS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE BILLS DOING -- SO I WOULD ASK EVERY MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF THIS BILL HELP US ADVANCE IT THIS MAY NOT DIRECTLY IMPACT YOU ALTHOUGH I WOULD ARGUE HIV IS A CONCERN FOR EVERYONE. IN THIS DAY AND AGE BUT THIS IS ON BEHALF OF AS WAS MENTIONED THE TESTIMONY THE THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO DO BECOME INFECTED EACH YEAR WE BECAUSE OF THIS AND OF THIS MEDICATION BECAUSE OF THIS TAX PAYER INVESTMENT -- THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED IT DOESN'T HAVE TO HAPPEN AND YOU CAN VOTE TODAY TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S LESS LIKELY TO HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE SO. I KNOW WE DON'T HAVE I DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE A QUORUM AT THIS TIME BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO MAKING A MOTION TO ADVANCE THIS BILL AGAIN COMMEND YOU SENATOR WIENER FOR TAKING ON YET ANOTHER DIFFICULT ISSUE -- BUT DOING IT IN SUCH A WAY THAT I THINK IT MAKES A VERY LIKELY OTHER WE CAN CHANGE THE NARRATIVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND HOPEFULLY CHANGE THAT FOR ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. WE KNOW THAT THIS SAVES LIVES -- IN THERE SHOULD BE NO DELAY IN GETTING. ACCESS TO MEDICATION THAT COULD PREVENT INFECTION AFTER EXPOSURE IN CERTAINLY NOT FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO TAKE IT UPON THEMSELVES TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. FROM WHAT COULD BE A DEADLY DISEASE -- THIS AT THIS SHOULD BE THE EASIEST FOR FOR PEOPLE ALL DAY AND I HOPE THAT THE LEVEL YES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM KIDDING MEMBERS AT THIS TIME. SEE SEE NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME SENATOR WIENER DO YOU WISH TO CLOSE. I YES I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK GOD -- MISTER COREY FOR HIS COMMENTS AND FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL AND OTHER HIV -- RELATED -- ISSUES THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- SO I I SAYS I DO WANT TO ADDRESS A COMMENT THAT WAS MADE BY THE LOBBYIST FOR THE AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION -- IT'S VERY CONFUSING TO PEOPLE SOMETIMES WHEN THEY HEAR -- AN HIV ORGANIZATION CON MEN AND EFFECTIVELY ADVOCATE AGAINST. OUR ADVOCATE IN OPPOSITION TO INCREASE ACCESS TO AN HIV PREVENTIVE IT'S VERY CONFUSING TO PEOPLE WHO AREN'T AWARE OF AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION LITERALLY RUNS MARKETING CAMPAIGNS. USE USES HIV HEALTH CARE DOLLARS TO RUN MARKETING ADVERTISING CAMPAIGNS TO PERSUADE PEOPLE NOT TO TAKE CRAP. THAT'S WHAT THIS ORGANIZATION DOES AND FRANKLY IT'S OUTRAGEOUS -- AND SO IN TERMS OF THE PRIVACY CONCERNS. LET'S BE REALLY CLEAR NO ONE HAS TO GET PROP. OR PAP THE PHARMACIST THIS BILL AND STOP PEOPLE FROM GOING TO A PHYSICIAN. OR IN THE CASE OF PAT BUT THEY WANT TO GO TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM. THIS DOESN'T CHANGE ANY OF THAT ALL IT DOES IS IT GIVES PEOPLE AN ADDITIONAL OPTION TO GO TO SEE A PHARMACIST AND SET. PEOPLE ALREADY CAN GO TO THE PHARMACIST TO GET WOMEN CAN GO TO GET BIRTH CONTROL. PILLS MORNING AFTER PILL. THERE'S A ORAL MANY ASPECTS OF SEXUAL HEALTH WHERE YOU CAN GO TO THE PHARMACY AND GET WHAT YOU NEED. GIVEN THE CONDOMS CAN GET ALL MAKE ALL SORTS OF SEXUAL HEALTH DECISIONS IN THE PHARMACY. IF THEY WANT TO OR THEY CAN GO AND SEE A DOCTOR IN A PRIVATE ROOM IN A DOCTOR'S OFFICE. SO THE IDEA THAT BY GIVING AN ADDITIONAL AUCTION. THE PEOPLE TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE WERE SOMEHOW INFRINGING ON PEOPLE'S PRIVACY. IS A COMPLETELY BOGUS ARGUMENT BUT UNFORTUNATELY IS INDICATIVE OF THIS ORGANIZATIONS DESIRE TO TRY TO SUPPRESS. ACCESS TO PROP -- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND SENATOR WIENER AGAIN OF ECHOING THE COMMENTS OF OUR FELLOW COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE. MADE THEIR OBSERVATIONS CLEARLY WITH RESPECT TO THE ADVOCACY THAT YOU HAVE MADE ON THE POLICY MERITS. OF THE BILL BEFORE US HERE SEEM AS SOME REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU OF A WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH US TO HELP STRENGTHEN THE BILL AND HELPING TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE COMPONENTS OF THE ISSUE. AS MOVES FORWARD CERTAINLY THE INTENSE LEGISLATIVE INTENT TO CONTINUE TO PROTECT INDIVIDUALS IS PARAMOUNT AND WE WANT TO SHARE IN THOSE EFFORTS. SIMILARLY AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE PROCESS WE WILL OF COURSE A WORK WITH THE ASSOCIATED PERSPECTIVE OF THE HOUSE TO ENSURE. A CONFORMITY ON THESE ISSUES A MOVING THE ISSUE FORD -- AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR CONTINUING THIS EFFORT WE CURRENTLY A LACK OF CORM SO WE'LL TAKE UP THE MEASURE WILL BE A STEPS A QUORUM BUT AGAIN -- WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR ASSISTANCE IN THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BUT THE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ITEM WHICH IS FILE ITEM NUMBER FIVE SB FOUR TWENTY FIVE BY SENATOR HILL. SENATOR WELCOME YOUR BILL ENJOYS IT DO PASS RECOMMENDATION ON BOTH SIDES PLEASE FEEL FREE TO PRESENT WHENEVER READY. LET ME FIRST START OFF BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENT SUGGESTED IN THE ANALYSIS WHICH WOULD STRIKE IN GOOD FAITH. SB FOUR TWENTY FIVE REQUIRES HOSPITALS CLINICS AND OTHER HEALTH FACILITIES TO REPORT ALLEGATIONS OF PATIENTS SEXUAL ABUSE. AND OTHER SEXUAL MISCONDUCT BY MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS TO THE APPROPRIATE STATE LICENSING AUTHORITY WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS. AS BEFORE TWENTY FIVE CLOSES LOOPHOLES THAT -- CAN ALLOW SUBJECT OF REPEATED SEXUAL ABUSE AND MISCONDUCT. A COP COMPLAINTS TO WORK AT A HEALTH FACILITY FOR YEARS BECAUSE THE RELEVANT REGULATORY BOARD IS NOT NOTIFIED BY THE FACILITY OF THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE LICENSEE. ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ABUSE OR MISCONDUCT BY DOCTORS AND OTHER MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS MUST BE REPORTED SWIFTLY TO THE APPROPRIATE LICENSING BOARD -- AS YOU'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH USC AND DOCTOR TYNDALL SCANDAL WHERE THERE WERE MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT FOR DECADES NONE OF THE PRIOR COMPLAINTS WERE REPORTED TO THE MEDICAL BOARD THIS IS WHY. THE MANDATORY REPORTING WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS TO THE MEDICAL BOARD IS ESSENTIAL. WE KNOW THE HOSPITAL'S TAKING CARE OF THESE ISSUES THEMSELVES HASN'T WORKED. JUST LIKE IT DIDN'T WORK FOR THE LEGISLATURE WHICH IS WHY WE FIND WE CHANGE THAT I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THIS MEASURE HAS NO OPPOSITION. AND THE RECENT AMENDMENTS I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE IN THERE ARE WITNESSES HERE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF YOU IS JUST KIND OF POP FROM MOMENTS SO THAT WE CAN ESTABLISH A QUORUM. LOW. HERE BRO.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND AND MEMBERS I'M HAPPY TO PRESENT -- SB FIVE SIXTY NINE I FIRST WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR FOR HIS PERSONAL INTEREST IN HELPING ME CRAFT THIS BILL. AND WE DO ACCEPT THEM AND SET UP AND SO AUTHORED -- I WOULD LIKE -- TO THANK ALSO AND SOCCER AND HEAR FROM THE STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY -- WE RECEIVED A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT CHALLENGES -- DURING THE DECLARED DISASTERS INCLUDING THE RECENT CAMP -- FOUGHT WILDFIRE. DURING THE CAMPFIRE MANY INDIVIDUALS WERE DISPLACED AND SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE OCCURRED INFRASTRUCTURE AND HEALTHCARE FACILITIES ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IDENTIFIED TO THE BOARD WAS A LIMITED ACCESS TO PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS INCLUDING CONTROLLED MEDICATIONS. LIKE PAIN ADHD DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY TREATMENT MEDICATIONS EXISTING LAW ESTABLISHES REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE SECURITY FORMS. INCLUDING REQUIRED ELEMENTS MUST BE INCLUDED ON THE PRINTED SECURITY FORM. BUT THERE IS CURRENTLY NO EXEMPTION FOR THESE REQUIREMENTS DURING A STATE A DISASTER. ALSO UNDER CURRENT LAW BOARD OF PHARMACY HAS THE AUTHORITY TO WAIVE PROVISIONS OF PHARMACY LAW IN A DECLARED EMERGENCY DISASTER. HOWEVER THIS AUTHORITY ODDLY DOES NOT EXTEND TO HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE PROVISIONS. IN ADDITION THE DURING A DECLARED DISASTER MANY PATIENT CARE AREAS OCCUR IN AREAS IN EMERGENCY SHELTERS PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND EVEN CHURCHES THESE TRADITION ON TRADITIONAL MEDICAL CARE SETTINGS MAY NOT HAVE. ACCESS TO COMPLY AND CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE SECURITY FORMS. SB FIVE SIXTY NINE WILL FIX ALL OF THIS. BY CREATING A LIMITED EXEMPTION TO THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES FORMS. REQUIREMENTS DURING THE INITIAL PHASE OF A LOCAL STATE OR A FEDERALLY DECLARED DISASTER. SB FIVE SIXTY NINE HAS NO FORMAL OPPOSITION IS PASSED THE SENATE COMMITTEES ON THE FLOOR UNANIMOUSLY TODAY WITH ME TO TESTIFY. AGAIN IN SUPPORT OF SB FIVE SIXTY NUYS ANSATA GRAHAM WHO IS THE ASSISTANT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PHARMACY WE WELCOME HER TODAY. THANK YOU ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF PHARMACY AT LIKE TO THINK CENTER TRISTAN FOR OFFERING THIS AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE CHAIR AS WELL AS COMMITTEE STAFF FOR YOUR IN PLAY AND MAKING THIS BILL EVEN BETTER -- THE BOARD IS A CONSUMER PROTECTION AGENCY CHARGED WITH REGULATING THE PRACTICE OF PHARMACY AND SO IT'S WITH THAT BASIC TENET THAT WE ARE PURSUING THIS LEGISLATION. THIS MEASURE WILL SECURE THE LIMITED EXEMPTION FROM CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES SECURITY FORM REQUIREMENTS DURING AN INITIAL PHASE OF A CRISIS OF A DECLARE DISASTER WHICH IS REALLY PROVIDING A BRIDGE FOR PATIENTS TO ACCESS TO LIFE SAVING MEDICATIONS. I THINK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION REQUEST RIGHT BUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MEGAN ALL RIGHT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION REALLY SUPPORT THE BILL IN PRINT THAT WE WORKED ON THIS ISSUE WITH THE SECURITY PRINTER. PRESCRIPTION PADS EARLIER THIS YEAR AND THE PROBLEMS IN IMPLEMENTATION AND REALLY SUPPORT THE WORK THAT THE SENATOR IS DONE ON THIS WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE AMENDMENTS OFFERED IN THE ANALYSIS. AND THE HINDRANCE OF TO ACCESS THAT WE BELIEVE THEY MIGHT RAISE -- SO WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO CHECK OUT THIS BILL AS IT IT GOES IN DIFFERENT WORK WITH THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU. HI THERE I'M MELINDA WILLIE AND THIS IS SWEET PEA SHE'S A LICENSE SERVICE DOG AND ALSO REGISTERED THERAPY DOG WE DID SEARCH AND RESCUE ON THE FIRES FROM JULY THROUGH AUGUST. UP NEAR MOUNT SHASTA AND READY AND WE ALSO DID HELP ON THE PARADISE FIRE WE RAN INTO MANY PEOPLE WHO DID NOT HAVE THEIR PRESCRIPTIONS COULD NOT GET THEIR PRESCRIPTIONS.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOT ASK MY WITNESSES TO DO WHAT I'M ABOUT TO DO WHICH IS TO CUT THEIR TESTIMONY IN HALF IF NOT MORE SO -- GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO ADDRESS CONCERNS FROM PROVIDER GROUPS AND CREDIT ISSUE OR IS IT LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF. FOR DEVELOPING THIS LANGUAGE IS A GREAT COMPROMISE AND I THINK YOUR DILIGENCE AND COMING UP WITH THESE OPPER OPTIONS SENATE BILL SIX THREE NINE WILL INCREASE IN STRENGTH IN CONSUMER PROTECTION SURROUNDING MEDICAL CREDIT CARDS THAT ARE OFFERED TO PATIENTS BY MEDICAL PROVIDERS. WHILE CURRENT LAW REQUIRES MEDICAL PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE PATIENTS WITH BASIC INFORMATION CONSUMERS ARE STRUGGLING WITH UNDERSTANDING. HOW DEFERRED INTEREST PROVISIONS WORK -- AGAIN THE THE WONDERFULLY CRAFTED AMENDMENTS THAT WE ARE ACCEPTING FROM THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT I BELIEVE REMOVE ALL OPPOSITION. AGAIN WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT CREDIT CANNOT BE OFFERED IT JUST CAN'T BE OFFERED WHILE YOU'RE IN THE DENTAL CHAIR ECCENTRIC CETERA -- I WOULD LIKE TO ALLOW MY WITNESSES TO SPEND OF THE TIME TALKING ABOUT WHY THEY THINK THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT. AND WILL ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS IN MY CLOSING IF THAT'S OKAY WITH THE CHAIR WONDERFUL -- UP TO THREE MINUTES IN TOTAL FOR TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT PLEASE FEEL FREE TO IDENTIFY YOURSELVES AND WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS JOY DOCTRINA TURNING THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA LEGAL SERVICES EVERYDAY LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS COME TO MY OFFICE. ASKING FOR HELP WITH MEDICAL BILLS THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY. MORE AND MORE OFTEN LATELY THEY'RE ASKING FOR HELP WITH DENTAL CREDIT CARDS. THAT THERE ARE STRUGGLING WITH I'D LIKE TO SHARE A FEW OF THEIR STORIES. LAST YEAR I MADE AN EIGHTY FOUR YEAR OLD AND CAL RECIPIENT WILL CALL IRENE. SHE WAS TOLD BY THE DENTIST THAT SHE NEEDED MORE THAN TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF TREATMENT AND THE DENTAL CAL WOULD COVER SOME OF THAT. IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT I READ COULD MAKE MONTHLY PAYMENTS ON THE REST WHICH SHE AGREED TO DO BELIEVING THAT SHE WOULD BE PAYING THE DENTAL OFFICE DIRECTLY. INSTEAD SHE WAS SIGNED UP FOR A DENTAL CREDIT CARD WITHOUT HER INFORMED CONSENT. THE FIRST BILL REVEALED THAT EVEN THOUGH SO FAR SHOULD ONLY HAD HER TEETH CLEANED FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS HAD BEEN CHARGED TO THE CARD. THE CARD CAME WITH AN EIGHTEEN MONTH DEFERRED INTEREST PLAN BUT IN ORDER TO AVOID PAYING INTEREST ON THE ENTIRE ORIGINAL BALANCE SHE WOULD HAVE HAD TO MAKE MONTHLY PAYMENTS OF MORE THAN 25% OF HER INCOME. A MAN LOCAL EDDIE WAS SEVENTY FIVE YEARS OLD WHEN HE WENT TO THE DENTIST WITH A TOOTHACHE IN ONE OF HIS FEW REMAINING TEETH. PRESIDENTE CAL RECIPIENT HE COULD HAVE HAD ALL OF THE TEETH PULLED AND FULL DENTURES PLACE AT NO COST TO HIMSELF. A DIFFERENT PLAN WAS RECOMMENDED AND SINCE ANY HAD DONE TO CAL A MEDICARE DENTAL PLAN AND A FORTY DOLLAR A MONTH INSURANCE PLAN THROUGH HIS DENTAL OFFICE HE AGREED TO PROCEED. AFTER HIS MOUTH WAS NUMBED AND HE WAS HANDED WHAT HE WAS TOLD WERE INSURANCE PAPERS TO SIGN. A MONTH LATER HE RECEIVED A DENTAL CREDIT CARD IN A BILL FOR MORE THAN EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS. IT TURNS OUT HIS PRIMARY DENTAL INSURER HAD REFUSED TO PAY ANYTHING BECAUSE NO PRE APPROVED TREATMENT PLAN WAS FILED AND NO CLAIM HAD BEEN SUBMITTED TO TEND TO CALVET ALL. IF SB SIX THIRTY NINE WERE LOCKED IRENE WOULDN'T BE BILLED FOR TREATMENT SHE WOULD HADN'T RECEIVED OR HAVE TO PAY EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF INTEREST ON THE ORIGINAL BALANCE REGARDLESS OF WHAT WAS LEFT ON THE CARD. AND ANY WOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD THE DENTED CAL WOULD COVER ALL THE TREATMENT HE NEEDED AND HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ASKED TO UNKNOWINGLY SIGNED UP FOR A CREDIT. CARD AFTER TREATMENT HAD ALREADY BEGUN. I HAVE MANY OTHER STORIES BUT TIME IS SHORT. ON A PERSONAL NOTE I KNOW THESE CARDS CAN BE USEFUL BECAUSE I HAVE. ONE I KNOW BUT I KNOW WHAT MY DENTAL INSURANCE COVERS I HAVE AN INCOME THAT SUPPORTS REPAYING THE BALANCES BEFORE DEFERRED INTEREST BECOMES A PROBLEM. AND I OPENED THE ACCOUNT FULLY AWARE OF THE TERMS LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS DON'T HAVE ANY OF THOSE ADVANTAGES AND WE NEED TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO KEEP THEM FROM FALLING INTO A TRAP FROM WHICH THEY HAVE NO ESCAPE. THANK YOU. GOOD UP GOOD MORNING STILL MOURNING -- MY NAME IS ALAN BONUS FROM LAGUNA BEACH FROM PRIVATE CITIZEN IN LAGUNA. ON FOUR YEARS AGO I NEED TO CONSIDERABLE WORK OVER THE COURSE OF CONSIDERABLE DENTAL WORK OVER THE COURSE OF TWO YEARS. ON IN CONSIDERING THE EXPENSE MY DENNIS RECOMMENDED THE KERR CREDIT PROGRAM OFFERED BY SYNCHRONY BANK -- WHICH LOOKED ATTRACTIVE AS EXPLAINED. IF I MADE ALL MY PAYMENTS ON TIME AND PAID OFF THE BALANCE BY THE END OF THE PROMOTIONAL PERIOD. ALL INTEREST CHARGES WOULD BE WAY AND THAT CERTAINLY WAS ATTRACTIVE UNTIL I GOT MY FIRST BILL. I HAD A SMALL BALANCE AT THE END OF THE PROMOTIONAL PERIOD AND EXPECTED TO PAY INTEREST ON THAT AMOUNT SO WHEN I GOT A BILL OF ALMOST A THOUSAND DOLLARS ON WHAT WAS A SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR BALANCE. I CAN FIGURE OUT HAS SYNCHRONY JUSTIFIED THREE HUNDRED FORTY NINE DOLLARS IN INTEREST ON A SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR BALANCE EVEN AT TWENTY SIX POINT 99% INTEREST. IT TURNS OUT THREE HUNDRED FORTY NINE DOLLARS ON THAT BALANCE WOULD IT BE AN EFFECTIVE INTERESTED FIFTY ONE POINT 7%. ALSO I CALLED SYNCHRONY BANK AND ASK THEM -- TO EXPLAIN THEIR MATH. BUT THEY TOLD ME THEY DO MATH DIFFERENTLY AT SYNCHRONY SO WOULD YOU. ESTIMATE YOUR COMMENTS PLEASE. YEAH THEY AND THEY SAID THE INTEREST WAS CORRECT BASED ON THE ORIGINAL BALANCE ON SO I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW THAT COULD BE BECAUSE I PAID MY MONTHLY BILLS ON TIME AND I PAY DOWN THE ORIGINAL BALANCE. BUT IT DIDN'T MATTER UNLIKE SOME OF MY OTHER CREDIT CARDS THAT HAVE A 0% PROMOTIONAL INTEREST SYNCHRONY HAD A UNIQUE DEFINITION OF DEFERRED INTEREST IN THAT VERY MUCH NEVER HEARD OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SEATED OUR TIME. A AGAIN THAT'S WHY I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR IT UP TO THREE MINUTES YES AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR PATIENTS FOR COMING TO TESTIFY ALL THE WAY HERE IN SACRAMENTO SO ANY ADDITIONAL -- ME TO USE WITH RESPECT TO THIS IS A WITNESSES WHICH IS BEACON SUPPORT [inaudible] NOT LAST DAM IN CALIFORNIA. WE'RE BACK EIGHT DOLLARS NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA'S. AND JENNIFER LAWRENCE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY HERE FOR QUESTIONS AND I SPONSORED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES ARE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. SEE NONE ANY WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION FEEL FREE TO COME UP HERE TO THE TABLE AND AGAIN AN ALLIANCE DATA. LINES DATA -- THIS COMPANY THAT MANAGES NUMEROUS -- RETAIL CREDIT CARDS AND CO BRANDED CARDS -- THEY ALSO MANAGE ON HEALTH CARE CREDIT CARDS AND WE'RE HERE ON BEHALF OF THE ONLINE STATE OF WE DO APPRECIATE THE SENATORS -- WILLINGNESS TO MAKE SOME CHANGES TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION AND APPRECIATE THE STAFF WORKING WITH HER STAFF AND TRYING. TO REACH SOME SORT OF COMPROMISE BUT WE STILL THINK THE BILL -- NEEDS SOME WORK -- WE THINK THAT ACTUALLY THE IT'S STILL A LITTLE WORSE FOR THE DOCTOR THE PATIENCE AND THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION THAT'S MANAGING. OF THE HEALTH CARE CREDIT CARD. REMOVING THE PROVIDER FROM THE TRANSACTION FOR FINANCING. YOU ARE ACTUALLY SENT SENDING THE PATIENT OUT. INDEPENDENTLY APPLY. FOR AN EXTENSION OF CREDIT WITHOUT FULLY KNOWING WHAT THE CHARGES AND FEES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH. THE PROCEDURE THAT THEY'RE LOOKING TO RECEIVE -- THEY MAY ACTUALLY. END UP APPLYING FOR MORE CREDIT. THAN THE ACTUAL NEED FOR THE PROCEDURE. SO IF YOU'RE FULLY INTEGRATED. AND YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE PATIENT NEEDS TO KNOW ALL THE CHARGES SO SO WITH THAT YOU CAN ASSIST THE PATIENT IN PROVIDE AN ON THE PLANE FOR THAT EXTENSION OF CREDIT. THEY WON'T BE GETTING ANY MORE CREDIT THAN THEY NEED. BUT WHEN YOU SEND THEM OUT THE USE A NAP OR THE USE AN IPAD THAT MAYBE WITHIN THE OFFICE -- THEY'RE JUST APPLYING FOR AN EXTENSION CREDIT SO IF THEY NEED ONLY FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR PROCEDURE THURMOND END UP GETTING TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS -- AS AN EXTENSION OF CREDIT -- AND YOU WILL WE DON'T WANT TO BE IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY'RE GETTING MORE CREDIT THAT'S NECESSARY FOR THE PROCEDURE -- SO WE WOULD HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WITH THE CENTER HER STAFF. WE THINK -- AT THIS TIME -- WE WOULD STILL REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBER SCOTT COVERING HER BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSOCIATION WE SHARE THOSE CONCERNS WE APPRECIATE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. THERE IS SOME CONFUSION FOR EXAMPLE THE BILL REFERS TO ACCEPTING -- CREDIT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS IF SOMEONE HANDS THE OFFICE THE ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT. THE IPAD. DOES THAT MEAN THEY ACCEPTTHIS. WAR IF THEY ASK THE OFFICE WHAT IS THE AMOUNT OF THE PROCEDURE CAN WE PUT THAT INTO THE IPAD THAT THEY'RE FILLING OUT. THEY DON'T DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THEY CAN DO THAT TO MISTER ALICE'S POINT SO SOME INVOLVEMENT WAS SEEN BE BENEFICIAL SO FOR THESE REASONS WE REMAIN OPPOSED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION NAME AND AFFILIATION IF YOU WISH TO DO SO. JASON LANE CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION ALSO OPPOSED.

OF BACK TO THE FIRES THIS SUMMER -- I WAS DOING A SEARCH AND RESCUE AND I GOT HURT IN THE FIRE SEVERELY I GOT A REALLY BAD SINUS INFECTION EVEN THOUGH I WAS WEARING A MASK. AND HAD HEAVY METALS GOING INTO MY SINUSES -- UNBEKNOWNST TO ME THAT SINUS INFECTION WHEN INTO MY UPPER JAW BONE AND I LEANED OVER AN EXERCISE CLASS CLASS ONE DAY AND HAD EXCRUCIATING PAIN FROM THE FROM THE NECK UP. THEY TOOK FOR DOCTORS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON A DENNIS TO PRIMARY CARE A NEUROLOGICAL CHIROPRACTOR AN ADONIS IN AN ORAL SURGEON. EVERY ONE OF THOSE HAD TO HAVE SOMETHING PAID WHEN I GOT TO THE ORAL SURGEON HE SAID I CAN'T WORK ON YOU UNLESS YOU PAY. LUCKILY I SAID DO YOU TAKE CARE CREDIT AND HE SAID YES I COULD BARELY TALK I WAS IN SO MUCH PAIN. THEY WERE CONCERNED THE INFECTION WAS GOING TO GO INTO THE MENINGES AND INTO MY SPINAL CORD AND CAUSE MENINGITIS. I DIDN'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PICK UP THE PHONE AND CALL FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND SAY CAN YOU HELP ME WITH THIS MONEY. I COULD BARELY TALK CARE CREDIT WAS A LIFESAVER IN MY INJURIES DURING THE FIRES. IN ICE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE AMENDMENTS ARE. BECAUSE I'M I'M A PRIVATE PERSON NOT NOT PART OF THE COMPANY SPEAKING -- BUT I REALLY VALUE THIS AND I'M HOPING THAT THE AMENDMENTS MAKE IT EASIER FOR US TO USE. BUT IT'S ALSO HELPFUL IN BAD SITUATIONS SWEET PEAS HAD EMERGENCY SURGERIES ESPECIALLY ON THE WEEKENDS WHEN YOU CAN'T GET SOME OTHER WAY TO PAY. AND CARE CREDIT REALLY HELPS IN THOSE AREAS. PLEASE DO THE PROPER AMENDMENT SO THAT PEOPLE LIKE ME AND ANIMALS LIKE SWEET PEA CAN GET THE EMERGENCY CARE. CAN PAY FOR IT WITH THE KERR CREDIT AND THEN FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING. TO BREAK UP THE PAYMENTS BEFORE THE PROMOTIONAL. IT IS UP I HAVE NEVER PAID INTEREST ON THIS CARD AND I'VE HAD IT FOR OVER TWO DECADES BUT YOU HAVE TO BE MINDFUL OF WHAT YOU'RE SIGNING. READ WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND PLEASE DON'T PENALIZE THE PEOPLE THAT DON'T READ THE FINE PRINT. BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE YOU GET IN TROUBLE IF YOU'RE NOT A RESPONSIBLE PERSON YOU MAY NOT FOLLOW THE RULES BUT DON'T PENALIZE US THAT DO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COULD MEMBERS NOW AT SEA ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL FOR WORKING WITH THE CHAIR AND STAFF. ON THE AMENDMENTS -- THAT HELP THE BILL AYE AYE MAY I SAY THAT I SHARE YOUR PASSION -- FOR CONSUMER PROTECTION SPECIALLY IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING. A MUCH MUCH NEEDED ATTENTION TO A VERY VERY IMPORTANT -- THAT IMPACTS LIVES BUT ESPECIALLY ALLIES OF THE UNDERSERVED AND THOSE THAT ARE IN MOST NEED IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND I THINK WE'VE PROBABLY ONLY STARTED TO SCRATCH THE SERVICE AND MUCH MORE WORK TO BE DONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS DR GRANT. I JUST WANTED TO ALSO THANK THE SENATOR AND IF I COULD TO THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL MY MOTHER ACTUALLY USED TO WORK AT CC LS AND MAKE NO YOU AND SO -- YOUR ADVOCACY AND VOICE FOR THE DISENFRANCHISES APPRECIATED AND RESONATES WALLOP. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND FOR THIS BILL. IT DOES -- DRIVE A TOUGH COMPROMISE AND I APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU TALK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS A MEMBER GIPSON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- SENATOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND TWO WITNESSES FOR COMING I WAS UNAWARE OF THIS UNTIL -- I GOT PRO APPROACHED AND SAT DOWN MY OFFICE AND MADE ME AWARE. OF THIS THAT EXIST AND CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE SENATOR PER ONE FOR DOING YEOMAN'S JOB AND APPRECIATE -- A COMPROMISE BEING REACHED AND HOPEFULLY THAT -- THIS BILL COULD UP SALES FORWARD AND I'M ALSO TRY TO MEET AND REACH SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT WAS RAISED. BY THE OPPOSITION BUT THEY WERE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AGAIN ONE THINK THE CENTER FOR HER LEADERSHIP -- MOVING THIS BILL FOR EXCESS WHAT'S HAPPENED IS TO MAKE THE MOTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF THAT AND THANK YOU FOR THE BILL SENATOR MITCHELL YOUR WITNESS WAS -- BEFORE HE HAD CUT ITS COMMON SHORT WAS IDENTIFYING AN ISSUE. OF THAT I FIND INTERESTING AND THAT IS I THINK THE NORM WITH -- A CREDIT CARD. IS THAT INTEREST IS BASED ON THE UNPAID BALANCE RIGHT THAT A CRUISE OVER THE COURSE OF WHATEVER TIME YOU HAVE THE CARD EXACTLY. IN THIS CASE WITH THESE CARDS -- YOUR YOU PAY NO INTEREST -- FOR CERTAINLY. YES IDENTIFIED YET AND THEN INTEREST IS A CRUDE ON THE ARE YOU YOU PAY EVEN IF YOU'VE PAID IT DOWN -- IF YOU HAVEN'T COMPLETED PAYING DOWN THE INITIAL BALANCE YOU OWE INTEREST ON THE ENTIRE AMOUNT EXACTLY -- I WOULD IMAGINE THAT EVEN FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE SAVVY ENOUGH TO READ THE FINE PRINT. THAT THAT IS. WOULD GENERALLY COMES A SURPRISE IT'S COUNTERINTUITIVE YEAH -- BECAUSE IT'S WHAT'S COUNTER EXPERIENCE YES -- YEAH AND AND COUNTER INTUITIVE. SO HOW DOES THE BILL ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. SO THE WAY THE BUILD ADDRESSES THAT CURRENTLY WITH A COMPROMISE IS PRODUCTS THAT PROVIDERS ARE PROCESSING APPLICATIONS FOR IN OFFICE CAN NO LONGER HAVE THAT PROVISION. THEY MAY STILL HAVE A 0% INTRODUCTORY PERIOD BUT AFTER THAT INTERESTS ME ONLY BE CHARGED ON THE REMAINING BALANCE. SERVER THAT HOWEVER PRODUCTS CAN STILL CONTINUE ON THE MARKET THAT HAVE A DEFERRED INTEREST PROVISION BUT CONSUMERS NEED TO SIGN UP FOR THOSE OUTSIDE OF THE OFFICE. BECAUSE MR BLOOM YOU KNOW WHAT WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT AS I THINK THE WITNESS TALKED ABOUT SHE WAS FORTUNATE SHE'D HAD A CARE. CARD FOR TWO DECADES PRIOR TO BE IN IN ANY EMERGENCY DENTAL SITUATION -- OUR CONCERN IS WHEN YOU'RE IN THE IN THE MIDDLE OF AN EMERGENCY DENTAL SITUATION AND YOU ARE HANDED DOCUMENTS TO READ IN TWO FONT -- WITH A TOOTHACHE IN THE DENTAL CHAIR. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT OUTSIDE ANYTHING FOR THE PAIN TO STOP IN FOR THE TREATMENT TO BEGIN. AND SO THAT'S WHY IT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR EXPERIENCE IF YOU'RE IN THE MEDICAL OFFICE VERSES IF YOU APPLY SEPARATELY BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE. ARE IN THE RIGHT SPACE OF MIND TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND FUND THEM FUNDAMENTALLY WHAT THE CREDIT CARD COMPANY -- REQUIREMENTS REALLY ARE SO THAT'S WHY THE DIFFERENCE IN EXPERIENCE IN THE TWO DIFFERENT SETTINGS [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. SEEING NONE SENATOR MITCHELL TO WAS TO CLOSE I WOULD JUST VERY BRIEFLY ACKNOWLEDGE -- SOME OF THE OPPOSITION THE CAME TO THE TABLE TO TALK ABOUT PATIENTS YOU KNOW -- BEING MADE FULLY AWARE OF CHARGES I THINK YOU KNOW I EXPERIENCE WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM A LEGAL AID REPRESENTATIVES IS YOU KNOW SOMETIMES PEOPLE HAVE NOT BEEN MADE FULLY AWARE OF CHARGES WHILE THEY'RE IN THE CHAIR. NOR HAVE THEY BEEN MADE FULLY AWARE OF WHAT DENTAL CALAR OR THEIR INSURANCE WOULD ACTUALLY COVER AND SO PART OF THIS BILL WHICH IS FUNDAMENTALLY A CONSUMER PROTECTION B. L. IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE -- RIDING IN LANGUAGE -- THAT IS NOT COUNTER EXPERIENCE CHILL -- THAT CAN BE UNDERSTOOD BY THE PERSON WHEREVER THEY ARE IN EITHER IN THE MEDICAL OFFICE OR APPLYING SEPARATELY AND ALSO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE INFORMED FULLY OF WHAT THEIR INSURANCE COVERS AND WHAT THOSE FULL CHARGES ARE WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED. AND THE MINUTES CLEAR FIGHT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ORTHODOX YEAH THAT YOU'RE NOT CHARGED -- FOR A FULL BATTERY A FULL TREATMENT SERVICES BEFORE RECEIVING THEM -- AND SO THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT THE BILL'S ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS AGAIN HATS OFF TO THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT FOR WORKING VERY HARD TO COME UP WITH THIS COMPROMISE LANGUAGE. ALL AND I ASK FOR AND I THOUGHT. WONDERFUL THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR MITCHELL THIS DOES ENJOY DO PASS RECOMMENDATION AND SIMILARLY WE LIKE TO THANK YOU IN YOUR OFFICE ALL. OF FOR WORKING WITH US TO ACCOMMODATE MANY THEN THE VARIOUS MOVING PIECES WHILE ALSO MAINTAINING THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT OF CONSUMER PROTECTION THAT WE ALSO SHARE WITH YOU AS WELL TO SOAK IN.
