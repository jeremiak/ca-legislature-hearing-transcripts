ALL HAS A BAND SIGNIFICANTLY AND ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN ADDED FEATURES AND ENHANCEMENTS TO THE CURRENT SYSTEM IN AN EFFORT TO KEEP UP THE ENHANCEMENTS AND STRETCH THE ONE SIMPLISTIC SYSTEM TO A POINT WHERE ADDITIONAL ENHANCEMENTS TAKE. MUCH MORE TIME AND MONEY TO IMPLEMENT. IN ADDITION EACH ENHANCEMENT FURTHER INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE. IMPLEMENTING THE NEW SYSTEM WILL NOT ONLY INCREASE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY BUT WILL RESULT IN AN ESTIMATED NET INCREASE OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUES TRANSPORTATION- FUND IN AN ESTIMATED INCREASE OF FORTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN UNCLAIMED PROPERTY RETURNED TO OWNERS.

THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SPEECH TODAY I AM CLING CALLUM CHIEF DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF I THINK I THINK IT'S PART OF GO BUSINESS SERVICES THE STATE'S GENERAL PURPOSE FINANCING AUTHORITY AND HOUSES THE SMALL BUSINESS FINANCE CENTER. I'M HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS THE STATE'S SMALL BUSINESS CREDIT INITIATIVE RSS BCI S. S. B. C. I WAS ORIGINALLY CREATED THROUGH FEDERAL LEGISLATION THE SMALL BUSINESS JOBS ACT OF TWO THOUSAND TEN. IN TWO THOUSAND TEN S. S. B. C. I WAS FUNDED WITH ONE POINT FIVE BILLION TO STRENGTH AND STATE PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT FINANCING OF SMALL BUSINESSES. CALIFORNIA RECEIVED A HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT MILLION OF THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION WHICH IS SPLIT EQUALLY BETWEEN AYE BANKS AND THE CALIFORNIA POLLUTION CONTROL FINANCING AUTHORITY WITHIN THE TREASURER'S OFFICE OR. CP CFA. I CAN REST PLAN ACT OF TWO TWENTY ONE RIYADH. A IS B. C. WHO ARE TO- INCLUDING MILLION. WE REFERRED THESE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FOR AS AS B. C. A. TO PO OUT. A TEN BILLION DOLLARS. FROM THE AMERICAN RESCUE ACTOR TWENTY TWO ONE WAS APPROPRIATE AS FOLLOWS. A APPROXIMATE SIX BILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE TO STATES TO BE DISTRIBUTED BY FORMULA BASED ON TWENTY TWENTY EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS. ONE POINT FIVE BILLION FOR SOCIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED BUSINESSES BASED ON POPULATION RESIDING AND SEE IF I INVESTMENT AREAS. WE REFER TO THESE AS THE STUDY FINDS. THERE'S ONE MILLION DOLLARS TIED TO THE CITY FUNDS BASED ON PERFORMANCE AND I'M- PROVIDING FINANCING TO THAT THOSE CATEGORIES. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FOR VERY SMALL BUSINESSES WHICH IS JUST NOT DEFINED A SMALL BUSINESSES WITH TEN EMPLOYEES OR LESS. I HUNDRED MILLION FOR. ASSISTANCE AND FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FOR TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS. JUST AS WITH S. B. C. I. ONE PLANO I THINK CAN SEE PEACE YET THEY ARE WORKING HAND IN HAND TO ENSURE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS FEDERAL FUNDING. JOINTLY WE EXPERIENCED STRONG SUCCESS WITH THE THREE PROGRAMS OPERATED AS THE S. B. C. I. ONE POINT NOW. FOR TWO POINT NOW I THINK IT'S YOU CAN SEE IT ADMIN MEETING BY WEEKLY JUST MET THE STATE PROPOSAL AND PREPARE FOR THE NEW SUNDAY. WE BOTH HAVE DEDICATED WEB PAGES EMAIL ADDRESSES TO KEEP THE PUBLIC INFORMED RECEIVED QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS. IT HELD A SERIES OF STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS OVER THE PAST YEAR TO SOLICIT INPUT ON OUR IMPLEMENTATION. THIS OUR- TO YOUR TREASURY PEPPERY PHYLLIS. ON MARCH SEVENTH THEY CAN FRIENDLY APPLET IN THE NATION. WE EXPECTED TO GO BEFORE THE TREASURY'S REVIEW PANEL IN YOUR FUTURE. WITH S. S. B. C. I. TO PLANO WE EXPLAINED DESPITE FUNDS EQUALLY AGAIN BETWEEN I THANK AND CTCA. NOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE S. S. B. C. I. REQUIREMENTS. TO RECEIVE SS DCI FUNDS THE STATE PLANS IS NOT MATCHES NOT REQUIRED. HOWEVER THERE MUST BE AT LEAST A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR MATCH FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR. AND THERE'S A CUMULATIVE LEVERAGE REQUIREMENT OF TEN TO ONE BETWEEN ALL S. S. B. C. I. PROGRAMS. THEREFORE SUCH FUN TO DRIVE AT LEAST TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS OF FINANCING ACTIVITY IN CALIFORNIA OVER THE LIFE OF THE TEN YEAR PROGRAM. THREE CRITICAL CONSIDERATIONS MSSP BCI WHICH ARE ALL SLIGHTLY AT ODDS WITH EACH OTHER. ARE BEING ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE A REASONABLE EXPECTATION THAT THE STATE'S PROGRAM WILL GENERATE A LEVERAGE RATIO OF AT LEAST TEN TO ONE. MEETING THE STEADY PERFORMANCE TARGETS TO BE ABLE TO MAXIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF. PERFORMANCE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIA AND MEETING THE DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS. WHICH ARE 80% OF THE FUNDS HAVE TO BE UTILIZED WITHIN THREE YEARS TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR EACH SUCCESSIVE CHALLENGE. AND ALL FUNDS HAVE TO BE UTILIZED. BY SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH OF THE THIRTY. I THINK PLANS. TO PROGRAM OVER THE THESE S. S. B. C. FUNDS THE FIRM IS OUR SMALL. LONGER PROGRAM THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT AND WAS A RECIPIENT OF ONE POINT OH FUNDS. IN MY REACHED EIGHTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS OF THOSE FUNDS AND INTO ONE BILLION DOLLARS OF FINANCING ACTIVITY. THE PROGRAMS CONTINUE TO GROW TO THIS DAY AND INCREASES ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. BY PROVIDING GUARANTEES ON BANK LOANS IN CASES WHERE LENDERS MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE TO MAKE A LOAN OR ONLY AT PROHIBITIVE INTEREST RATES. WE PLAN TO ALLOCATE THREE HUNDRED NINETY ONE DOLLARS TO THIS PROGRAM. THESE ON STAKEHOLDER INPUT. WE HAVE MADE NUMEROUS CHANGES ENHANCEMENTS TO THE PROGRAM. WE'VE INCREASED OUR DANTE CAP FROM ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. WE'RE WORKING ON INCREASING LENDER PARTICIPATION IN OUR PROGRAM WITH A FOCUS ON MORE SIGNIFIES AND MINORITY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS. WERE INCREASING ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDING TO OUR SEVEN NONPROFIT FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION TO HELP US ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM. WERE EXPLORING A WEB BASED PORTAL TO CONNECT LENDERS SMALL BUSINESSES TO THE LENDERS ON OUR PROGRAMS. AND WE'RE ALSO CONSIDERING OTHER FOR- I AM ENHANCEMENTS. THE SECOND PROGRAM I MAKE PLANS TO OPERATE AS A VENTURE CAPITAL PROGRAM ONE OF THE S. S. B. C. HAS FIVE ALLOWED PROGRAMS. THIRTY OTHER STATES IN JURISDICTIONS IN S. S. B. C. I. ONE POINT OUT USE THOSE FUNDS TO STATE SET UP STATE VENTURE CAPITAL PROGRAMS. KELLER COUNTY HAS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY. TO CATALYZE A MORE INCLUSIVE VENTURE CAPITAL ECOSYSTEM AND WILL APPLY TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO INVEST IN UNDERREPRESENTED VENTURE CAPITAL MANAGERS. UNDERREPRESENTED ENTREPRENEURS GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OF CALIFORNIA RECEIVED LITTLE VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDING. AND PROMOTING CLIMATE EQUITY IN CLIMATE JUSTICE. WHILE INITIALLY COMPLEX TO ESTABLISH THE VENTURE CAPITAL PROGRAM HAS OTHER BENEFITS YOU CAN DISPERSE LARGE AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL COMPARED TO THE OTHER PROGRAMS AND TELL SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER CAPITAL LEVERAGE. IT MAY ALSO PROVIDE SMALL BUSINESSES NON DEBT CAPITAL WHICH. STAKEHOLDERS NOTED IS AN IMPORTANT NEED. IN A TO THE CAR SUPPORT PLANS S. S. B. C. I. TO NO INCLUDE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS NATIONWIDE FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. TREASURY HAS ANNOUNCED HIS PLAN DISTRIBUTION OF THE FIRST THREE HUNDRED MILLION WITH TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS GOING TO STATES TERRITORIES AND TRIBES AND ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS GOING TO THE MINORITY TO GET BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AGENCY WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE. CALIFORNIA IS SLATED TO RECEIVE TWENTY FIVE POINT THREE MILLION SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATE WILL ADMINISTER THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE COMPONENT OF SCCI. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FUNDING WILL PROVIDE A RANGE OF ASSISTANCE FROM LEGAL ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES. OFFICES SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATE INTENDS TO LEVERAGE HIS EXPERIENCE WITH THEIR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE EXPANSION PROGRAM IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE SS DCI TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FUNDS. THE APPLICATION FOR THIS PROGRAM IS DUE JUNE THIRTIETH AND THE PROGRAM GUIDANCE WAS JUST RELEASED LAST WEEK. I'M HERE TODAY WITH CHRISTINA ST. CAN OF DIRECTOR CVS CFA DISCUSS THEIR PROGRAMS I WANT TO PASS IT OVER TO HER. HELLO HELLO GOOD MORNING MY NAME'S KRISTINA I AM THE DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR CBC OKAY AND- WE JOINED WITH I BANKS YOU SUBMIT OUR APPLICATION FOR SS DCI FUNDING- USING TWO OF OUR PROGRAMS THE- HOW CAP SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM WHICH IS A LOAN LOSS RESERVE PROGRAM WHERE WE- MATCH A LENDER- THEY PUT MONEY INTO A RESERVE ALONG WITH THE BAR WORK AND THEN WE MATCH WITH THE LENDER HAS PUT IN UP TO THREE AND A HALF PERCENT- THE PROGRAM PROVIDES LENDERS WITH THE NEEDED ENCOURAGEMENT SAID LEADING TO SMALL BUSINESSES THAT FALL SHORT OF QUALIFYING. FOR TRADITIONAL LENDING AN ASSIST CALIFORNIA'S UNDERSERVED SMALL BUSINESSES IN OBTAINING CREDIT TO HELP THEM GROW EXPAND AND INCREASE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES WELL THERE'S NO MINIMUM TAP NO MINIMUM OR A CAP ON THE AMOUNT THAT WE IN ROLE WE DO CONSIDER THIS PROGRAM TO BE A MICROLENDING PROGRAM WITH THE AVERAGE ENROLLED LOAN BETWEEN FIVE THOUSAND AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS HOW CAP FOR SMALL BUSINESS LOANS MAY BE ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM FOR UP TO TEN YEARS AND WHILE THE FEDERAL WE DETERMINE SMALL BUSINESS IS FEWER THAN FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES HOW CAP AS THESE PRIMARY LOAN ENROLLMENT AT NINETY ONE PERCENT. IS TO BUSINESSES WITH FEWER THAN TEN EMPLOYEES SOME OF THE TYPES OF. LOANS THAT WE'VE- IT ARE- THE LARGEST LOAN WAS FIVE WERE EVEN IN. YOUR IN THE WORLD OUT WITH AND A HALF MILLION AND WORK CAPITAL FOR A MINUTE STAFFING COMPANY. AND THEN THE SMALLEST LOANS THAT WE'VE DONE HAVE BEEN AROUND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND THEY FUNDED BUSINESSES AS VARIED AS A FOOD CART VENDOR. PRESCHOOL AND THE BOOK PUBLISHING COMPANY- OTHER EXAMPLES OF THE TYPES OF BUSINESSES THAT WE NEED TO HELP OUR DIRECT SELLER. JANITORIAL SERVICES BEAUTY SALONS FULL SERVICE RESTAURANTS MOBILE FOOD SERVICES AND TRUCKING COMPANIES THE TOP THREE LOAN PURPOSES ARE FOR WORKING CAPITAL. OR INVENTORY AND START UP COSTS- THE SECOND PROGRAM IS OUR PROGRAM. AND IT DOES WHAT IT SAYS IT PROVIDES COLLATERAL SUPPORT- LIAM ROLE WHEN A LENDER AND ROLLS THE LOAN- IN SIESTA KEY WE PROVIDE COLLATERAL FOR LOANS OF AT. A FIFTY THOUSAND OR MORE- CSP PROVIDES PRIORITIZE IS VERY SMALL BUSINESSES BY PROVIDING A LARGER PERCENTAGE OF COLLATERAL SUPPORT FOR LOANS UP TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. IT ALSO PRIORITIZES MANUFACTURING AND GREEN BUSINESSES FOR PROVIDING MORE COLLATERAL SUPPORT FOR LOANS FROM FIFTY THOUSAND TO TWENTY MILLION FOR THOSE TYPES OF BUSINESSES. BOTH OF THESE PRIORITIES ALIGN WITH THE S. S. B. C. I. TWO POINT OH GOALS. THESE GOALS THESE LOANS ARE USUALLY SHORTER TERMS AND LARGER AMOUNTS AND THE CAL CAP S. S. B. THEN THE- SB PROGRAMS USED PHONES MAY BE ENROLLED FOR A MAXIMUM OF. FOUR YEARS IN OUR LARGEST LOAN ENROLLMENT WAS A TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ITS FUNDED WORKING CAPITAL FOR IN ENGINEERING SERVICES FIRM. AND OUR SMALLEST LOAN IN ROME IT WAS FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND PROVIDE WORKING CAPITAL FOR A RESTAURANT. OTHER EXAMPLES OF BUSINESSES USING CS. PR MANUFACTURING RESTAURANTS AND TRACKING AND THE TOP THREE PURPOSE FOR THE WORK WORKING. EQUIPMENT PURCHASES AND TENNIS. WE DO WANT TO- THERE'S A THIRD THAT WERE LOOKING AT. SORRY IT'S A LOAN. PRO THERE AND WHERE WE WOULD ACTUALLY BE INVESTING IN A% LOAN- WITH THE LANGER'S. AND WE'RE HOPING TO IMPLEMENT THE L. P. P. WITHIN THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF S. S. B. C. I. TWO POINT NO IT WILL REQUIRE US TO AMEND OUR APPLICATIONS REFLECT THE THIRD PROGRAM AND WILL ASK THE U. S. TREASURY TO ADJUST OUR ALLOCATION TO INCLUDE LPP. THE INCLUSION OF THE L. P. P. AND I BANKS NEW VENTURE CAPITAL PROGRAM WILL COVER ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S BASES IN PROVIDING EVERY PROGRAM TYPE AVAILABLE THAT MEETS THE U. S. TREASURIES PROGRAM TYPES WITHIN THE S. S. B. C. I. TWO POINT OH GUIDELINES. AND HOW DO WE PLAN TO GET THAT MONEY OUT WE AND WE THE PROGRAM- CAL CAP HAS BEEN CONTINUOUSLY RUNNING FOR TWENTY YEARS AND SO WE YOU KNOW EVEN WITHOUT THE S. S. B. C. I. FUNDING WE'VE BEEN ROLLING. CONTINUOUSLY DO OUTREACH BUT FOR S. B. C. ID WE'RE GONNA INTENCIÓN ENGAGE WITH OUR LENDER COMMUNITY EXPAND OUR NETWORK OF LENDERS CAL CAP AS HE CURRENTLY HAS TWENTY LENDERS AND BC'S P. PROGRAM HAS SEVENTEEN LENDERS WITH TWO MORE ON DECK AS THEY COMPLETE. THEIR REQUIRED LENDER EDUCATION IN AN EFFORT TO FURTHER INCENTIVIZE OUR LENDERS CPC OBEY HADN'T INCLUDED A NEW PROGRAM FEATURE AND SUSPENDED ANOTHER- THE IMPLEMENTED WHEN WILL BE THE LONE RESERVE MATCHING SO CURRENTLY FOR- THE LOAN LOSS RESERVE PROGRAM WE ONLY MATCH WITH THE LENDER PUTS INTO THE RESERVE ACCOUNT BUT WE'RE GOING TO. I'M GOING FORWARD WITH S.S. B. C. I. TWO POINT OH WE'RE GOING TO MATCH THE LENDER AND THE BORROWER SO THAT'LL BE CAL CAP PROVIDING A SET UP TO SEVEN PERCENT- AND THEN THE OTHER THING WE'RE GOING TO DO IS SUSPEND THE RECAPTURE FEATURE FOR- S. S. B. C. I. TO POINT OUT. AND THEN FURTHER OUTREACH THAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE PARTNERING PARTNERING WITH THE OFFICE FOR STOP SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATES. AS WELL AS I BEING- AND THEN. OUTREACH TO LENDER WEB IN OUR LENDER ROW. CONTAIN TO TEND AT INDUSTRY EVENTS NETWORKING- AND WE'RE GONNA TRY AND TAKE A SYNERGISTIC APPROACH WITHIN THE TREASURER'S OFFICE- THERE IS A PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE CALLED LEAFLETS THE LOCAL AGENCY INVESTMENT FUND. THEY HAVE TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED MEMBERS AND WE'RE GOING TO BE USING THAT AS A OUT REACH POINT. AND HOPEFULLY I KNOW WE SPOKE EARLIER ABOUT- CAL SAVERS AND WE'RE HOPING TO USE THAT AS AN OUT REACH POINT ALSO. AND THE OTHER PART THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WAS REPORTING. D. S. B. C. I. TWO POINT NO HAS ANNUAL AND QUARTERLY REPORTING- AND WE'LL BE FOLLOWING ALONG IT'S VERY REVISED- THE REPORT. IS THE CURRENT QUARTER IN CUMULATIVE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF LOANS AS WELL AS ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THERE'S ALSO A SUMMARY OF ALLOCATED A RECYCLE BINDS. AND ADJUSTMENTS AND APPLICABLE IN THE QUARTERLY REPORT IS A SPREADSHEET PROVIDED BY TREASURY TO SPECIFIC FIELD THAT WILL HAVE TO COMPLETE- THE ANNUAL REPORTS IS THE HIGH LEVEL SUMMIT BY THE TRANSACTIONS. AND IT WILL INCLUDE SOME SIR STEADY DEMOCRAT. MINORITY OWNER BY STATUSES WOMEN KNOWN TO CONTROL BUSINESS VETERANS AND ANY RACE ETHNICITY. GENDER SEXUAL ORIENTATION MIDDLE EASTERN OR NORTH AFRICAN ANCESTRY AND THAT TURNED STATUS WITHIN THE PRINCIPAL OWNERS IDENTITY. AND THAT WAS ALL I HAD. THAT WAS A LACK- ARE WE NOW HEAR FROM BUT GOOD GOOD STUFF ARE WE NOW GOING TO HEAR FROM AS FRENCH TUBO. I AM I BROUGHT HER LUNGS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OKAY YOU HAD ANY QUESTIONS RIGHT NOT JUST YET BUT YOU NEVER KNOW ALL RIGHT SO I GUESS NOW WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM- THE ALEJO'S OFFICE. ALTHOUGH I HAVE S. TEO KARMA MANNY. NOW ALL RIGHT MISTER WHETHER FOR YOUR UP. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS BRIAN WHETHER FOR AND WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE PREPARED A HAND OUT OF THE PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE STATE SMALL BUSINESS CREDIT INITIATIVE PROGRAM. AND YOU SHOULD HAVE A PHYSICAL COPY BUT- AND- IN ALL NOTE THAT THE HERE THAT'S AVAILABLE ON THE COMMITTEE'S WEBSITE AS WELL FOR. ANYONE WHO HAS AN INTEREST BUT OBVIOUSLY IN THE INTEREST OF TIME NOT GONNA WALK THROUGH ALL OF THE HAND OUT IT HAS A LOT OF- WE THINK IT COULD BE HELPFUL REFERENCE TO YOU BUT- BUT OBVIOUSLY THERE'S SOME LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME BUT- AT IT BUT FOR EXAMPLE AND HE JUST THREE AND FOUR WE DESCRIBE THE FIVE TYPES OF. PUBLIC LOAN PROGRAMS TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES AND THAT SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESS LENDERS- SEE IF YOU ARE CURIOUS ABOUT LIKE WHAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CAPITAL ACCESS. PROGRAM AND DAY- LEARN PARTICIPATE PROGRAM YOU YOU CAN SEE THE IN THERE- BY. I'M GONNA AHEAD PAY. THE JOHN F. JUMP AHEAD BROTHER. SO THE STATE ONE EIGHT- WE THINK IT COULD BE HELPFUL IT PROVIDES SOME SUMMARIES. FOR THE FIRST ITERATION OF THE SS DCI PROGRAM AND- I WANTED TO CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS TABLE BECAUSE IT HIGHLIGHTS SOME OF THE KEY DIFFERENCES- BETWEEN THE IBEACON CPSC PROGRAMS THAT- BURKE WERE DISCUSSED AND IF YOU LOOK IN THE MIDDLE- COLUMN ON TOTALLY FINANCING FRIENDS I'M SORRY THE TOTAL NUMBER OF LOANS INVESTMENTS AND THEN THE AVERAGE-AMOUNT YOU'LL SEE THAT THE CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAM SUPPORTED A- RELATIVELY LARGE NUMBER OF LOANS. THAT WERE ALSO RELATIVELY- SMALL DOLLAR AMOUNTS AND- THE LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM- FOR EXAMPLE- BUT LISTEN TO SOME OF YOUR LOANS BUT MUCH LARGER DOLLAR VALUE SO I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT- IN CONTEXT AND- WHAT WAS JUST DISCUSSED AND ALSO THINKING ABOUT. ON THE PROGRAM MOVING FORWARD- AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT MORE OF THIS IF YOU WANTED AGAIN BUT ON THE ON- THE- ATTORNEY. NINE DESCRIBE SECOND ITERATION OF THE SST SAGT AND I'M NOT GOING TO DWELL ON THIS BECAUSE THE PREVIOUS PANELISTS DESCRIBED IT VERY WELL. I DID WANT TO CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THE THREE VOTES FOR BOTTOM OF PAGE NINE SO ON THESE ARE THE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS THE MISTER KELLAN I JUST DESCRIBED. AND IT. IS MIGHT HAVE BEEN CLEAR FROM THAT BUT- WE WANT TO CALL ATTENTION TO IT TO SOME EXTENT THE VARIOUS REQUIREMENTS OF THE FEDERAL- PROGRAM. WORK AT CROSS PURPOSES- AND THE PROGRAMS WILL NEED TO BALANCE THESE REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER FOR THE PROGRAMS TO ACHIEVE ALL OF THEIR OBJECTIVES. AND IN THE LAST COUPLE DAYS AND ALSO REPRINTED IN THE AGENDA ARE SOME OF OUR- KEY TAKE AWAYS BUT THE MAIN OVERARCHING POINT IS THAT THE STATE. WILL NEED TO INCREASE ITS CAPACITY FOR THESE LENDING SUPPORT PROGRAMS ON PRETTY QUICKLY. AND THAT THIS WILL LIKELY REQUIRE THE STATE TO TAKE ON A LITTLE BIT MORE RISK. OTHER PROGRAMS WILL NEED TO SIMULTANEOUSLY GIVE ATTENTION BOTH TO PROGRAMS THAT HELP THE SMALLEST BORROWERS AS WELL AS THOSE THAT HELP SMALL BUSINESSES. AT THE LARGER END OF THE SPECTRUM. AND THEN- REALLY TO. OF IS- WE SUGGEST YOU LOOK FORWARD AHEAD TO TWENTY THIRTY. AND BEGIN THINKING ABOUT HOW THE FUNDS THAT- ARE MADE AVAILABLE FOLLOWING THE REPAYMENT OF LOANS ARE REDEPLOYED. AND RECYCLED IN THESE PROGRAMS. TO THIS END YOU WILL LIKELY WANT TO ENSURE THE PROGRAMS ARE TRANSPARENT THEY KEEP GOOD RECORDS AND AVOID INTERMINGLING STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS FOR EXAMPLE. MOREOVER WHILE THE PROGRAMS ARE TO SOME EXTENT. SELF SUSTAINING TWO THREE OTHER FEES AND INTEREST PAYMENTS AND SO FORTH- THEY DO TYPICALLY- OVER THE LONG RUN REQUIRE SOME- MAY REQUIRE SOME GENERAL FUND SUPPORT SO YOU'LL WANT TO CONSIDER WITH THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF ON GOING SUPPORT WOULD BE FOR THESE PROGRAMS- THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR THEM TO CONTINUE AT A CERTAIN LEVEL. AND SO THIS CONCLUDES OUR INITIAL COMMENTS BUT WE CAN DIG INTO ANY SPECIFIC ASPECTS- MORE DEEPLY DEPENDING ON YOUR LEVEL OF INTEREST. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT- WE DON'T HAVE AYONE ELSE CUED UP WE'RE GOING TO BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE SENATOR ROB DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. SENATOR ROTH SAID NOW YOU KNOW WELL MISTER WEATHERFORD YOU- SORT OF SUGGESTED I LOVE IT YOU SAID WHAT WE MIGHT NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY. THE STATE WILL NEED TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY AND HERE I WAS THINKING WHERE DO WE GET TO THE PLACE WHERE WE CAN OFFER ZERO. 3% INTEREST LOANS. TO SMALL BUSINESSES- THAT NEED THIS KIND OF HELP GIVEN THAT THERE ARE NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE ALSO DOING THIS KIND OF WORK ON A MUCH SMALLER SCALE THAT HAVE VERY HIGH REPAYMENT- RATIOS AND SO BUT THAT JUST. MIGHT BE MY SOCIALIST SELF COMING. YOU KNOW IF I IF I IF I CAN I THINK ABOUT IT HIGHLIGHTS- THESE THESE THIS BALANCING THAT THE AND YOU KNOW THE TREASURER'S OFFICE I THINK MIGHT BE A PROVIDES MORE. DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THIS BUT THE HIGHLIGHTS THAT THE TRUTH THE CHALLENGES THAT THE REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BECAUSE THERE'S THE LEVERAGE. PROVIDING A 0% INTEREST RATE WOULD- MAYBE NOT GET THE- THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF LEVERAGE RATIO OR MIGHT- REQUIRE THE STATE TO TAKE ON MORE RISK TO MEET HISTORICALLY- BEEN COMFORTABLE TAKING ON SO IT'S ABOUT BALANCING THESE COMPETING OBJECTIVES. NO I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE ELSE WANTS TO COMMENT ON THAT QUESTION MISTER CALLUM YEAH YEAH- I THINK ONE THING TO POINT OUT TO YOU IS THAT THESE ARE CREDIT SUPPORT PROGRAMS. SO THEY'RE SUPPORTING BANKS BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE CAPITAL THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO BE DIRECT GRANTS TO BANKS AND SO THERE STILL HAS TO BE A FINANCIAL INTEREST IN THE BANK MAKING LOAN- AND WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO. MITIGATE RISK- AND IN THAT MITIGATION AND THEY'LL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE CAPITAL THEY MAY LOWER THAT INTEREST RATE- BUT GIVEN THAT THEY ARE. YOU KNOW THEY OPERATE ON- A MARGIN THEY HAVE TO CHARGE SOME INTEREST AND SO OUR PROGRAMS ARE CERTAINLY AIMED AT TRYING TO LOWER THOSE. COSTS BUT I ELIMINATING THEM ALL TOGETHER- ISN'T REALLY AS A POSSIBILITY WITH THIS PROGRAM. ALL RIGHT MOVING BACK TO CAPITALISM. I'M I. HAD A QUESTION THE- MISS SERIN TALKED ABOUT. YOU'RE WORKING WITH A LENDER COMMUNITY AND ALSO OBVIOUSLY HOPING TO EXPAND. THAT NETWORK- YOU KNOW GIVEN WHAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE- IN FRONT OF US. HAVE GIVEN ANY THOUGHT TO. SPECIFICALLY WHAT THAT KIND OF ALTERNATIVE OR EXPANDED OUTREACH WOULD LOOK LIKE I MEAN I ALWAYS AM ASKING FOLKS TO CONSIDER- GROUPS THAT YOU HAVEN'T NORMALLY WORKED WITH IN THE PAST BECAUSE THEY CAN HELP US CONNECT WITH FOLKS THAT-NEED THIS INFORMATION AND ALSO NEED THE RESOURCES BUT AREN'T TRAVELING IN THE CIRCLES THAT THE STATE THINKS THEY SHOULD BE SO I'M THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW- FRATERNAL AND SORORITY ORGANIZATIONS- SMALL CHAMBERS- EDCS X. FEDERA. CAN YOU JUST SORT OF SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE YOU'RE OUT REACH PLAN IT WOULD LOOK LIKE. MORE DEEPLY ABSOLUTELY I'M WELL AND LIKE I WAS SAYING I WANTED TO USE THE TREASURER'S LOCAL AGENCY INVESTMENT FUND THAT IS- SMALL- AND LOCAL CITIES COUNTIES SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND THERE ARE TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED MEMBERS OF THAT FINE AND THAT'S AN ACCESS TO ALL ACROSS THE STATE AND SO WE WOULD LIKE TO USE THAT THAT OPPORTUNITY- BUT WE WILL BE HAVING LANGER ROUND TABLES- GETTING THEIR INPUT AND THEN GOING OUT TO INDUSTRY EVENTS- AND BASICALLY JUST GETTING OUT THERE MORE. I DON'T KNOW- INTERNALLY I WOULD LIKE TO TRY AND DO MORE YOU KNOW HIGHER EIGHT EIGHT AND OUTSIDE- ADVERTISING COMPANY I JUST BECAUSE A LOT OF THE PEOPLE AT THE DISADVANTAGED GROUPS THERE AND THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY TECH SAVVY- OR THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO INTERNET AND SO I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO REACH THOSE TYPES OF PEOPLE. BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S STILL SOMETHING THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING INTERNALLY ACT I DIDN'T ALISON MAY HAVE SOMETHING MORE TO ADD ALISON.

WOULD INCREASE THE STATE'S NONREFUNDABLE RENTERS TAX CREDIT- IT'S CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO RENTERS A SIXTY DOLLAR CREDIT AGAINST THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX LIABILITY FOR SINGLE FILERS AND A HUNDRED TWENTY DOLLAR CREDIT. AGAINST THEIR LIABILITY FOR JOINT FILERS ON AND THE SENATE PLAN WOULD INCREASE THAT TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR JOINT FILERS FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. OUT FOR SINGLE FILERS THEY WILL ALSO LINK THAT CREDIT AMOUNT TO INFLATION- TO INCREASE OR DECREASE EACH YEAR ACCORDINGLY- THE CURRENT AMOUNT IS. IS NOT TIED TO INFLATION. AND THE FINE COMPLY OF THE SENATE- BUT PLAN. HE SAYS IS UP OPERA TO SOME EXPAND- THE GOVERNOR'S CURRY.

IN THE- AND I WOULD HAVE BURKE JUST FOR QUESTIONS THANK YOU OKAY UNDERSTOOD- SENATOR. HAVING YOUR QUESTION. SO YOU KNOW WHAT MR. I TO DO NOT HAVE ANY QUESTIONS THERE WAS BACKGROUND THAT WAS PRESENTED AND AS YOU MENTIONED THINGS ARE STILL BEING FLESHED OUT AND SO I'M SURE WE WILL HEAR MORE ABOUT IT BUT THANK YOU FOR AT LEAST PROVIDING US WITH A FRAMEWORK. FOR WHAT'S TO COME. WE ARE NOW GOING TO MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER. TWENTY ONE WHICH IS PUTTING WEALTH TO WORK YET AGAIN AND THIS TIME SUPPORTING CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE. AND THOSE IMPACTED BY KOBE MR ALAMO YOU ARE UP AGAIN. THANK YOU. TWENTY ONE- RELATES TO THE WHOLE CARE ACT- THE SENATE BUDGET PLANS ARE PROPOSES TO SET UP SAVINGS ACCOUNTS FOR CHILDREN WHO WHO LOST A PARENT TO- THAT TO COVER NINETEEN AND FOR CHILDREN IN THE IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM- AND THESE INITIAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS WOULD RECEIVE A DEPOSIT. OF FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EACH CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF. OUR TENS OF YOUNGER CHILDREN AN EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLAR INITIAL DEPOSIT FOR CHILDREN. OVER THE AGE OF TEN BOB THE TREASURER'S OFFICE WOULD MANAGE THE DEPOSITS AND ONCE CHILDREN- BECOME ADULTS THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE FUNDS UP FOR THEIR YEARS AGAIN THIS IS A COMPONENT OF THE SENATE BUDGET PLAN AND- SIMPLY PROVIDING SORT OF A DESCRIPTIVE OVERVIEW OF THE PORTAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR ROTH ANY QUESTIONS OF COURSE. NO AND I JUSTWANT TO. I USED TO SAY I WANT TO REITERATE IT I THINK IS A IMPORTANT THESE ARE INTEREST BEARING ACCOUNTS. HI YES THAT'S RIGHT MONTR. OKAY IN FOUR THOUSAND IF YOU'RE UNDER TEN. EIGHT THOUSAND IF YOU'RE OVER TEN I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE HOW MANY YOUNG FOLKS HAVE SUFFERED BECAUSE OF COBIT BECAUSE A PARENT OR GUARDIAN IS PASSED AWAY. AND THEN THOSE THAT ARE IN- OUR FOSTER CARE SYSTEM SO I LOVE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ALSO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO MIRROR. WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE WITH THINGS LIKE UPI AND WORKING TO ALLEVIATE POVERTY SELF WE WILL ALSO WAIT FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THIS BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH- AND NOW WE WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER. TWENTY TWO WHICH IS A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS INSANE ABILITY FIND GO BUSINESS HERE- I HAVE QENA. HERERA DID I SAY IT CORRECTLY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRMAN IS KIND OF. RIGHT KIND OF PEREIRA WELL YOU'RE UP THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY NAME IS KIND OF RARE SENIOR ADVISER FOR BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE RELATED TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUDGET SUSTAINABILITY FONG. OUR GOAL WITH THIS PROGRAM IS TO ESTABLISH A PROGRAM DIRECTED TO DIVERSIFICATION OF LOCAL REVENUES. VIA RESOURCES FOR PROJECTS ENABLING FUTURE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES AS IDENTIFIED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND A HIGH LEVEL THIS MEANS THAT OUR TEAMS WILL ENGAGE WITH THE LOCAL COUNTY GOVERNMENTS TWO HUNDRED AND THEIR PRIORITIES IN EVERY INDUSTRY DIVERSIFICATION AND THE CREATION OF MULTIPLE APERTURE THESE THROUGH LEVERAGING FEDERAL FILES. WHILE NOT EXPLICITLY AS A REVENUE REPLACEMENT PROGRAM FOR CRITICAL SERVICES THIS IS INTENDED TO DIRECT FUNDS TO PROJECTS THAT COULD LANGUISH DUE TO LOCAL FUNDING AVAILABILITY. THIS FUNDING IS INTENDED TO BE DIRECTED TO THOSE COUNTIES EXPERIENCING HIGHER LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT POVERTY USING ALREADY ESTABLISHED INDICATORS TO THE COUPLE IT'S PROGRAMS. THAT HAVE ALREADY IDENTIFIED ROUGHLY TEN COUNTIES CURRENTLY. ARE INTENDED TO IDENTIFY PROJECTS THAT WILL BREED LONG TERM OPPORTUNITIES FOR INCREASE LOCAL REVENUES LESSENING THE OVERALL VARIABILITY OF REVENUES- WITH THEIR IMPACTS ON VERBAL SERVICES. THE RESULTS OF THIS PROGRAM SHOULD BE STRONGER AND MORE RESILIENT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BUT BECOMING LESS RELIANT ON THE OVER CONCENTRATION OF SINGLE INDUSTRY PRACTICE AND EXPANDING LEVERAGE BY COUPLING FUNDS WITH FEDERAL GRANT PROGRAMS. I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT PROGRAM AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS OKAY GREAT NOW WE'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE LA ALL THOSE OFFICE IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS. HI WHETHER FOR LEGISLATIVE. OFFICE AND- I JUST WANT TO START BY REITERATING OUR- PREVIOUS COMMENTS THAT WE MADE AT THE SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING AND IN FEBRUARY WHEN WE NOTED THAT THE- IT WAS UNCLEAR HOW THE PROPOSAL WOULD RELATE TO. THE STATE'S OTHER EFFORTS TO ADDRESS. THE VARIOUS ECONOMIC ISSUES RUNNING THE TRANSITION TO AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS- IN PART THIS WAS DUE BECAUSE THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE NOT YET FINALIZED IN PART BECAUSE THE STATE'S OTHER EFFORTS ARE STILL BEING DEVELOPED- WE NOTED PREVIOUSLY ALSO THAT. THE ADMINISTRATION OF PROVIDED A CLEAR JUSTIFICATION FOR THE SPECIFIC DOLLAR AMOUNT TO THE TIMING OF THE FUNDING THAT WAS REQUESTED- AND SO I THINK IT JUST OVERALL WE SHARE THE CONCERNS RAISED BY YOUR STAFF THE- COMMENTS IN THE- COMMITTEE AGENDA. THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE BEFORE YOU- MAY LACK A CLEAR FOCUS- IT IT ALSO- PROVIDE A GREAT DEAL OF LATITUDE TO GO BUSINESS IN DETERMINING. THE GRANT CRITERIA- SO WE KNOW THAT THERE'S NO URGENCY TO ACT ON THIS PROPOSAL BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOT REQUESTING FUNDING FOR THE CURRENT BUDGET YEAR. THE REMINDER OF THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU IS REQUESTING FUNDING FOR A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. AND TWELVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX. SO WE RECOMMEND YOU REJECT THE PROPOSAL WITHOUT PREJUDICE IN ORDER TO TAKE MORE TIME. TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO REFINE THE DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL- ALSO TAKING ADDITIONAL TIME WILL ALLOW YOU TO CONSIDER THIS PROPOSAL WITH THE BENEFIT OF HAVING MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE STATE'S. FISCAL CONDITION LATER THIS YEAR NEXT. THANK YOU FOR THAT I FELT LIKE I YOU KNOW INTERRUPTED YOU ALL RIGHT NOW. TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENT. MORNINGTON WEBER DEPARTMENT FINANCE JUST JUST A QUICK COMING TO SAY THAT WE FOR THE GOVERNOR TO PROPOSAL INCLUDED TRAVEL LANGUAGE- ANY INTENTION THAT IT HAS A PROVIDING ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY STRUGGLING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NOW WE'RE GOING TO BRING IT BACK TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SENATOR IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT WELL I YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO A SAY THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE A HOLD OPEN ITEM BUT I TO WANT TO- SHARE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS RAISED BY THE LA O'S OFFICE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE- YOU KNOW. CLEAR JUSTIFICATION FOR BOTH TIMING AND FOR THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT YOU'RE ASKING EVEN WHEN IT REGARDLESS OF IF IT'S A LARGE AMOUNT OR SMALL MARK- AND- I THINK WE ALSO ECHOED THE CONCERN THAT IT DOES PROVIDE A LOT OF LATITUDE- TO GO BIZ WITH REGARDS TO ESTABLISHING CRITERIA CLEAR CRITERIA AND GUIDELINES. SO I'M HOPING THAT SOME OF THAT WILL GET FLUSHED OUT- BEFORE THIS COMES BACK TO US. DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA ABOUT LIKE HOW MUCH IN GRANT FUNDING EACH LOCAL ENTITY IS LIKELY TO RECEIVE. WE CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE ESTIMATES FOR THOSE AMOUNTS HOWEVER DURING THE PROJECT IDENTIFICATION PHASE WHICH IS THE FIRST YEAR AND PROBABLY SECOND HERE- WE HOPE TO IDENTIFY PROJECTS THAT ARE COUPLE THE- NOT JUST. THE AMOUNTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE BUT USING THOSE AS LEVERAGE ON FEDERAL PROGRAMS THAT ARE ALSO AVAILABLE. HAVE YOU GOTTEN ANY FEEDBACK FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE FOR THESE FUNDS ON WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR AND WHAT THEY NEED AND HOW THEY CAN USE THEM. WE HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH A NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE INCLUDING FRESNO. KERN AND TO HIM UP- WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS AROUND WHAT PROJECT ORIENTATIONS ARE LOOKING FOR DIVERSIFICATION PURPOSES. HAVE THERE BEEN ANY THOUGHTS ON ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES ARE IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT MONIES ARE USED APPROPRIATELY. WE ARE CONSIDERING AND THEN STILL LOOKING THROUGH HOW TO DIRECT THESE RESOURCES APPROPRIATELY I THINK WE'RE AIMING TO LEVERAGE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. FEDERAL DOLLARS IN FEDERAL PROGRAMS IN THE DEFINITIONS THAT ARE SCRIBE BY THOSE PROGRAMS TO BE ABLE TO- INDICATE THOSE THOSE METRICS THAT WE HAVE TO DEFINE AS WELL. AND ARE THERE CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW TO SORT OF MORE NARROWLY FOCUSED- THE GUIDELINES AND CRITERIA SO THAT THE DISCRETION IS NOT SO RELAXED. YES AND WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOUR OFFICES AS WELL TO REFINE THOSE CRITERIA. OKAY GREAT WELL THANK YOU AS I MENTIONED THIS IS GOING TO BE A HOLD OPEN ITEM AND SO WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON ISSUE TWENTY THREE. COMBATTING ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT- MISA LYNN GRAY. YES IS HERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO START. MEDIA I AM CHIRLA AND GRAY OUR DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA'S OFFICE INTO SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATE THANK YOU FOR. LEADING HIM WALK COMMITTEE THE BUSINESS RETAIL CROWNS PROGRAM I WILL BE IN THE STATE ARE GOAL- WE DESIGN THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR AND RESPOND. TO REAL IMPACTS THAT WE TELL DOCTOR HAVING ON BUSINESSES THAT CAL SH THAT IN MIND- LET ME JUST THAT ARE HIRED HOW THE PRO WILL WORK IF IN OUR BUSINESS EXPERIENCES RETAIL STAFF. ARE OR OUR JUNE ONE TWO TWO TWO AND THEY KEEP FINANCIAL WITH HE GOT THAT PROGRAM THEY WILL BE ELIGIBLE IT MEETS CRITERIA. GEN THERE THE SIZE FOR. I. BE A REGISTER IN I DID NOT FOR NON WITH ANNUAL REVENUE BETWEEN THOUSAND AND FIVE MILLION. I KNOW. I EXPERIENCED THEFT ON MURSCHEL PROPERTY ON J. ONE LATER AND IT- THEY HAVE TO HAVE OF THE LAN PORTS AGENCY WORK. OR AN IN CLAIM EXACTLY DATE THE. THREE HEALTH STAFF ARE OFTEN REQUIRE THEY BE OPEN OR HAVE PLANS TO MEET. AND IT THERE IS THE- REQUIRED IN THEY MUST PROVIDE STATE TAXES ANOTHER DOCTOR OR ALLEGATIONS- PURPOSE AS SUCH AND THERE WERE. IS THAT FOR RETAIL MEMBERS. HELLO AT OUR END NETWORK QUESTION GREAT THANK YOU LA OWES OFFICE WOULD YOU LIKE TO COMMENT FORD WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND- YOU KNOW THE MINISTRATIONS PROPOSED GOAL FOR THIS NEW GRANT PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE COMPENSATION TO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF RETAIL THEFT. AS WE NOTED IN FEBRUARY IMPLEMENTING THIS CONCEPT WOULD FACE A LOT OF PRACTICAL CHALLENGES AND WE HIGHLIGHTED IN PARTICULAR HOW IT WOULD LIKELY BE DIFFICULT TO DEFINE THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND HOW BEST TO DOCUMENT LOSSES BUSINESS OWNERS EXPERIENCE RELATED TO BOTH. FROM LEGAL DEFINITIONS AS WELL AS I'M TRYING TO MINIMIZE THE BURDEN ON ON BUSINESSES- THAT APPLY FOR THE GRANTS AFTER REVIEWING THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND MEETING WITH- WITH DIRECTOR GRAY AND- THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE WAS CLEAR THAT- THE ADMINISTRATION'S GRAPPLED WITH THESE CHALLENGES. THEY'VE THOUGHTFULLY ATTEMPTED TO BALANCE. PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS- THIS FOR OUR CURRENCY DURING CONFLICT- SO FOR EXAMPLE THE PERSON WOULD NEED TO REQUIRE SOME SORT OF DOCUMENTATION IN ORDER TO REDUCE LIKELIHOOD FRAUD WHILE ALSO BEING FLEXIBLE AND SIMPLE ENOUGH TO MINIMIZE BERMAN APPLICANTS. NONETHELESS WE NOTE THAT THE DEFINITION OF RETAIL THEFT AND THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA BOTH ARE QUITE BROAD AND THIS RAISES TWO MAJOR CONCERNS SO FIRST WE BELIEVE THE PROGRAM WILL QUICKLY BE OVERSUBSCRIBED. AND SECOND IT SEEMS LIKE WITH THE PROGRAMMING NOT- PROVIDE. THE THIS SORT OF ASSISTANCE THEY MIGHT HAVE IN MIND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT- YOU KNOW PROGRAM THAT'S DESIGNED TO- PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO SMALL RETAILERS AFFECTED BY ORGANIZED RETAIL. SO FIRST- OF THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S PURPOSE FOR THE PROGRAM THREE MILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE RESERVED FOR ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. 15% ON LEADING SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR GRANTS. SO SKINNER. HAVE AN AVERAGE GRANT OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH WE THINK IS VERY REASONABLE- FOR A PROGRAM WITH A MAXIMUM OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS WE ESTIMATE THE PROGRAM WOULD WORK FEWER THAN TWELVE HUNDRED GRANTS. AND GIVEN THE BROAD ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA WE EXPECT THAT THE PROGRAM WOULD QUICKLY BECOME OVER STRIPED- HOWEVER WE SHOULD NOTE THAT NEITHER WE NOR THE ADMINISTRATION. HAS CONDUCTED ANALYSIS THE NUMBER OF SMALL BUSINESSES THAT THAT ARE LIKELY TO BE VICTIMS OF THEFT ARSON AND VANDALISM I BETWEEN JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND WITH THE PERFORMANCE- BUT I DO SAY SMALL BUSINESSES ON VERY INTENTIONALLY BECAUSE OF THE CARE THAT. PRETTY MUCH ANY BUSINESS- THAT MEETS THE REVENUE ELIGIBILITY AND HAS BEEN A VICTIM OF PROPERTY DAMAGES AFTER VANDALISM ARSON WOULD LIKELY BE ELIGIBLE. AND SO RETAILERS MAINLY COMPRISE A PORTION OF THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE ABLE TO SECURE A GRANT. ON THE FOR THE FUNDING IS EXHAUSTED AND GIVEN THESE POTENTIAL CONCERNS WERE. CONCERNED THAT BY CREATING THIS PROGRAM YOU COULD FIND YOURSELF IN A SITUATION DOWN THE ROAD WHERE- SIMILARLY TO THE SMALL BUSINESS COVERED RELIEF GRANT PROGRAM WHERE MULTIPLE ADDITIONAL ROUNDS OF FUNDING WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MEET THE ON THE DEMAND THAT. ON THE MATERIALIZE FOR THIS PROGRAM. LASTLY WANTED TO THE WORLD CAN THAT THE PROBE SEEMS BE RELATIVE EXPENSIVE. SIMILAR PROGRAMS HAVE COST OF ONLY AROUND FIVE PERCENT- RELATIVE TO THE 15% HERE SET ASIDE FOR THIS PROGRAM. NOW GIVEN THE CHALLENGES POSED BY SETTING UP THIS NEW AND FAIRLY COMPLICATED PROGRAMS THAT MAY NOT BE IN A REASONABLE AMOUNT BUT IT DOES. INFORM YOUR ASSESSMENT PERHAPS IT'S LIKE THE COST EFFECTIVENESS SO. WITH THE MATH WE DID BEFORE THAT WORKS OUT TO ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR GRANT AWARDS. SO THAT CONCLUDES OUR COMMENTS. THANK YOU FOR THAT- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS. AND WEBER PART OF FINANCE NOTE YOUR ACCOUNT THIS TIME. THANK YOU BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE SENATOR ROB DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ABOUT. ALL RIGHT WELL I TO- WANT THANK YOU FOR THAT DR MR A- SENATOR ROB I- WANT TO. GO I'M IN A CRAZY PLACE TODAY YOU HAVE NO IDEA BUT YOU CAN BE DOCTOR AND SENATOR HANNON MISTER AT THE SAME TIME. HE HE HE- YES SO YOU KNOW THE WORDS THAT ALSO CAME TO MY MIND WERE HOT MESS THIS SEEMS LIKE- AB AS STILL A PROPOSAL THAT'S RATHER ON COOK AND I DO ECHO A MANY OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE LA O'S OFFICE- ORGANIZED THEFT IS REAL- VANDALISM AND BURGLARY AND THEFT HAVE HIT A NUMBER F OUR- BUSINESSES UP AND DOWN THE STATE. OUT WE DO HAVE TO GET A HANDLE ON IT I'M JUST WONDERING IF THERE IS A BETTER WAY FOR US TO BE COMPASSIONATE TOWARDS THOSE FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF THEFT RATHER THAN SOMETHING LIKE THIS WHICH STILL IS RATHER VAGUE- I IF I RECALL FROM THE HEARING THAT WE HAD EARLIER IN THE YEAR THERE- WAS MENTIONED THAT THERE ARE MANY VICTIMS OF RETAIL THEFT. THAT EITHER HAVEN'T FILED REPORTS SO THAT WERE AFRAID TO REACH OUT BECAUSE OF RETALIATION AND OTHER ISSUES AND SO MY CONCERN WOULD HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT KNOW HOW TO ACCESS THESE KINDS OF FUNDS THAT ACTUALLY HAVE PEOPLE ON THE PAY ROLL WHO ARE WATCHING FOR WAYS TO FOR. TO YOU KNOW. FIND AND APPLY FOR RESOURCES WOULD BE FIRST IN LINE SINCE THIS IS FIRST COME FIRST SERVE AND MANY OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES AND MOM AND POP BUSINESSES THAT I'VE ALSO SUFFERED FROM RETAIL THEFT AND DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO THAT. ARE GOING TO MISS OUT- 15% ALSO SEEMS KIND OF HIGH THAT'S LIKE A BAD CREDIT CARD I WONDER WHY THE COSTS ARE SO HIGH FOR ADMINISTERING THIS PROGRAM- AND I JUST. YOU KNOW WE'VE HERE WE'VE HEARD SO MANY AND WE READ SO MANY ARTICLES IN THE PAPER AROUND YOU KNOW JUST THE CHALLENGES WITH EDT THE CHALLENGES WITH OUR RENTER'S ASSISTANCE PROGRAM THROUGH THE EVICTION MORATORIUM. DOLLARS AND EFFORTS AND I WOULDN'T WANT THIS TO BE ANOTHER BAD HEADLINE- AND SO I'M ALSO JUST WONDERING IF WE CAN COLLECT DATA. ON THE NUMBER OF SMALL MIDSIZE AND LARGE COMPANIES- THAT HAVE SUFFERED FROM ORGANIZED STAFFED AND IF WE CAN FIND ANOTHER WAY TO DISTRIBUTE- FUNDS TO THEM TO HELP THEM OPEN UP MANAGE THEIR REPAIRS GET BACK ON TRACK. BECAUSE AN AVERAGE OF TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS- MIGHT NOT BE WORTH THE TIME THAT IT TAKES SOMEONE TO TRYING TO HUSTLE UP AND GET THIS MONEY- I DON'T KNOW I KNOW MISS GRAY IS NO LONGER HERE IF THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE WHO CAN RESPOND. RYAN RUTLEDGE BUDGET OFFICER GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT- ON BEHALF OF THE VISION AND CALIFORNIA- SBA THE WOULD THE MINISTER THE PROGRAM. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE INPUT WE HAVE. THE FIRST BIG POINT IS THAT WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING INPUT FROM THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE SURE THIS WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL. WE APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS AND ACKNOWLEDGE- THE POINT YOU'RE MAKING. I'LL JUST RESPOND I GUESS TO SEVERAL THEM WITH TWO BIG POINTS. ARE IN TERMS OF EQUITY THE ADMINISTRATION IS FOCUSED ON TRYING TO STRIKE A REASONABLE BALANCE BETWEEN. EQUITY AND EFFICIENCY AND IN DESIGNING THIS PROGRAM. THE WAY WE THINK WE CAN MAKE SURE THE FIRST COME FIRST SERVE MODEL IS EQUITABLE IS- WE WILL BE LEVERAGING. CALLOW SBA'S EXISTING APPROACH TO WORKING-WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS AND- BASICALLY A BIG- HUNDRED PLUS ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE STATE THAT HAVE HELPED US- BASICALLY- MAKE SURE THAT FOR THE COVERED RELIEF. GRANT PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE SMALL BUSINESSES WERE AWARE OF THIS THEY HAD THE ASSISTANCE THEY NEEDED TO APPLY. SO WE WOULD ESSENTIALLY MAKE SURE THAT FOR THOSE WITH CAPACITY ISSUES- WE WOULD LEVERAGE THAT EXISTING NETWORK. THE SECOND POINT IS ON ON TERMS OF THE YOU YOU WOULD RAISE THE POINT ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE BUSINESSES AND THE CONCERN THAT MAYBE. A LARGER ANNUAL REVENUE BUSINESS WOULD- IT WOULD SORT OF DOMINATE THIS GRANT PROGRAM- IN ADDITION TO THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- NETWORK THAT WE WOULD LEVERAGE. AS I SAID WE ALSO DID MAKE SURE TO DESIGN THIS AS- FOR A FOR A LARGER- BUSINESS LET'S SAY MILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL REVENUE RELATIVE TO THE HUNDRED K. ANNUAL REVENUE BUSINESS. YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE INSURANCE YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE. A GREATER CAPACITY TO DRAW DOWN TO MAXIMIZE YOUR INSURANCE CLAIM. THE WAY WE WROTE THIS LANGUAGE. THE ONLY ELIGIBLE USES WOULD COME AFTER AN EXISTING AND CHURNS. SO IF YOU A RELATIVELY WITHIN THE SMALL BUSINESS WORLD A RELATIVELY. LARGER ENTITY- OUR OUR VIEW IS THAT. YOU WOULD LIKELY- HAVEL A LOT CLAIMED BY INSURANCE AND THEREFORE- FOR THE FOLKS THAT MAYBE DIDN'T HAVE A SUCCESS THEY EITHER DON'T HAVE INSURANCE OR DON'T HAVE. ACCESS TO MAXIMIZING THEIR INSURANCE- WE TRY TO MAKE IT SO THAT. THEY WOULD. ESSENTIALLY HAVE A GREATER ACCESS HERE. SO I'LL STOP THERE BUT APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS AND THE INPUT. THANKS I'M WITH THIS ALSO INCLUDES THE STREET VENDORS. IT'S BEST IT'S SPECIFIED AS COMMERCIAL PROPERTY. SO YOU HAVE TIME FOR TOMORROW I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A VIEW ON THAT OFFICIALLY BUT- SO- GIVE THAT WE CAN GET BACK TO YOU IF- AND LOOK AT THAT BUT I I'M I'M GNNA SAY THEY'LL ALL JUST FLAG THAT WE HAD COMMERCIAL PROPERTY CALLED OUT AS- NEEDING TO BE IMPACTED. OKAY WELL IN THAT THE HELP WAS GREAT BACK. NOW SHE'S GONE YES MA'AM I JUST WANTED TO ADD SOME CONTACT AROUND THE HEIGHT I'M SO SMALL BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA CAN HAVE A FEW. HUNDRED EMPLOYEES AND FIFTEEN AND DOLLARS AN AVERAGE REVENUE NOW ON THE DAY HAPPY REVENUE CAP FOR THIS PROGRAM SENATE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS REALLY THE MICROBIT THRESHOLD AND IT'S WORTHY TO NOTE THAT THE- PERCENT OF THOSE FEDERAL REGISTER. EIGHT ARE ACTUALLY. THAT MAULERS. FILLED FIFTY. HAS REALLY BEEN. FOR THE SMALLER OF OURS BUSINESS IN THE WITHOUT READ CAP AT FIVE MILLION. OKAY THANK YOU THAT- I DO I DO THINK THAT. ARE THE NET WHY- AND I THINK WE DO WANT TO HAVE SIEVES- BECAUSE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT IF WE'RE SAYING WE'RE GOING TO HELP THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF ORGANIZED STAFF THAT WE COME UP WITH A PROGRAM THAT REALLY WILL ADDRESS THEM MEET THEM WHERE THEY ARE- IN A KNOWLEDGE THAT THEIR- SMALL BUSINESSES OF ALL SHAPES AND SIZES AND KINDS. THAT HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED- BY ORGANIZED CRIME IN ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT AS A RESULT OF COBIT AND THE PANDEMIC AND SO YOU KNOW JUST LIKE WE'VE BEEN SAYING THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THIS HEARING YOU KNOW IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE PROGRAMS THAT ARE CUSTOMIZABLE- IN THAT ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT SO MANY FOLKS HAVE BEEN DISENCHANTED BY GOVERNMENT. AND SO UNFORTUNATELY THAT MEANS WE HAVE ADDITIONAL HURDLES THAT WE HAVE TO OVERCOME TO PROVIDE RESOURCES IN A WAY THAT IS MEETING FOLKS WHERE THEY ARE AND ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS THAT THEY HAVE WITH THEIR INABILITY TO GET TO US. BUT YOU ARE IN LUCK BECAUSE IT IS STILL ON HOLD OPEN ITEM SO THERE IS HOPE YET- WE HAVE REACHED THIS PORTION OF THE PROGRAM WHERE WE ARE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ANYONE PROVIDING PUBLIC COMMENT. BEFORE I GO INTO THE SCRIPT- IF THERE ARE ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THEIR WAY AT TO ROOM TWENTY ONE HUNDRED WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU BECAUSE AFTER PUBLIC COMMENT WE WILL BE GOING TO- VOTE ONLY.
