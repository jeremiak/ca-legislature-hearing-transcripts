CHARGE YOU. DAVIES DAVIES ARKANSAS IS. GONZALEZ I HOLDEN KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY MAIENSCHEIN REYES. RAYSIDE TOP. OKAY THAT BILLS OUT THANK YOU WE WILL NOW MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER TWO SB TWO ELEVEN. ALREADY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IN MEMBERS- S. B. TWO ELEVEN IS THE ANNUAL BILL RELATING TO THE STATE BAR TYPICALLY THIS IS A NON CONTROVERSIAL BILL- THIS YEAR IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF SOME OF INSTEAD OF THAT HAVE BASICALLY BEEN DISCOVERED IN THE COURSE OF THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS- YOU'VE HEARD REPORTS. OF MISTER TOM GIRARDI AND ISSUES SURROUNDING HIS PRACTICE AND- THE USE OF OUR LEAST ALLEGE USE OF CLIENTS TRUST FUNDS. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS THIS BILL. REAUTHORIZES STATE BAR BUT ELIMINATES THE BAR DUES- AT LEAST UP UNTIL THE STATE BAR- NOMINATES AND HAS CONFIRMED CHIEF TRIAL COUNSEL BAR HAS NOT HAD A CHIEF TRIAL COUNSEL FOR FIVE YEARS I AM CONFIDENT THEY ARE MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION- AND- I AM MOST HOPEFUL THAT THAT. I WILL AMEND THE BILL TO. PLACE THE BAR DUES THE- PARDEW'S AMOUNT BACK IN THE BILL WHICH WOULD BE THE SAME AS LAST YEAR. OF THE BAR HAS DONE AN AUDIT- WE'VE NOT SEEN THAT AUDIT- NEED NEITHER CHAIR STONE NOR I HAVE SEEN THAT AUDIT AND WE THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT THAT THERE BE. ANOTHER OUTSIDE COMPREHENSIVE AUDITS. OF AFTER. THE BAR NOMINATES AND WE HAVE CONFIRMED A CHIEF TRIAL COUNSEL. I EXPECT THAT THE- DUES WILL BE REPLACED AND THAT THEY'LL BE A BILL WHICH WE PASSED BY BOTH HOUSES AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. AYE ORIGIN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER WE DO HAVE A MOTION IS THEIR SECOND. AND A SECOND THANK YOU I DO HAVE TWO WITNESSES LISTED FROM THE STATE BAR I KNOW THAT THE STATE BAR IS NOT ACTUALLY IN SUPPORT BECAUSE A COUPLE OF THE PROVISIONS. BUT WANTED TO SPEAK ON THE BILL SO WE HAVE SHOWN SELECT FROM THE STATE BAR AND WE HAVE LIAM WILSON WHO IS ALSO ON THE TELEPHONE. HERE FOR ON STAND BY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. SO THE FIRST WITNESS. HI GOOD MORNING JERRY MEMBERS I AM SHAUN SELAIN CHAIR OF THE STATE BAR BOARD OF TRUSTEES I'M HERE WITH WE WILL SEND. A POOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR- AND WE HAS GRACIOUSLY GRANTED ME SOME OF HER TIME. UNFORTUNATELY AS YOU ALREADY MENTIONED THE STATE PARKS UNABLE TO SUPPORT SB TWO ELEVEN IN ITS CURRENT FORM. BECAUSE THE BILL CURRENTLY PROVIDES NO FEES AND LINKS THE BARS OF FORTY TO COLLECT FEES TO CONFIRMATION OF THE CHIEF TRIAL COUNSEL. IF YOU KNOW LICENSING FEES OR THE BARS PRIMARY SOURCE OF FUNDING AND THE ONLY FUNDING. FOR THE DISCIPLINE SYSTEM. LET ME BE CLEAR THAT THE KERN BOARD SHARES YOUR INTO IN REFORM UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATION THAT YOU FEEL. WE LIKE QUITE CAN FEEL FRUSTRATED THAT AT TIMES AS WE WORK TO INVOLVE THIS ORGANIZATION. I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT THIS BOARD IS NOT CONTENDING MISTAKES OF THE PAST. YOUR OWN OCCASIONAL MISSTEPS WE ARE TRYING TO RECTIFY THEM WE ARE LISTENING AND WANT TO WORK WITH YOU IN A PRODUCTIVE MANNER. HOWEVER LACK OF STABLE FUNDING GAMMAGE'S THE INSTITUTION THAT WE ALL WANT TO REFORM AND WILL MOVE US BACKWARD. NOT FORWARD. THE STATE FARM HAS BEEN DILIGENTLY CONDUCTING A CHIEF TRIAL COUNSEL SEARCH AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO FINDING THE MOST QUALIFIED PERSON FOR THAT ROLE. HOWEVER THE POSITION IS DIFFICULT THIS BILL AND I DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL HAVE TO CONFIRM CHIEF TRIAL COUNSEL BY THE END OF THE LEGISLATIVE SESSION. TWO NINE OR DELAYING FUNDING FOR THE ENTIRE ORGANIZATION WILL ONLY MAKE IT HARDER TO RECRUIT FOR THIS POSITION AND OTHERS. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WITHOUT FUNDING IT WILL BE CONSUMERS OF LEGAL SERVICES STATE PARK STAFF. THEY WILL PAY THE PRICE. LET ME MENTION THIS ARE ADDRESS CAN THEY- REPORT. THE STAFF AND- HIGHLY. THE AUDITORS TO TEST IN OUR THE BACKLOG GROWTH FOR THE PERIOD. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. ON THIS ISSUE CONTACT MATTERS. ARE FILING DURING THAT PERIOD INCREASED BY NEARLY 20% IN LARGE PART DUE TO AN ENHANCED PUBLIC PROTECTION MEASURE WHICH THE BAR SELF INITIATED. MAINLY A REQUIREMENT THAT ALL ATTORNEY BE REACHING FOR CREDIT FOR CRIMINAL RECORD SCREENING. FURTHER THE ADDITIONAL STAFF FUNDED BY THE TWENTY TWENTY THREE INCREASE HAVE BEGUN TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. THE STATUTORY BACKLOG WAS REDUCED IN 20255% MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR THE CASES THEY HAVE THE GREATEST IMPACT ON PUBLIC PROTECTION. SUCH AS THOSE THAT INCLUDE ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT AGAINST VULNERABLE VICTIMS INCLUDING IMMIGRANT SENIORS THE BACKLOG WAS REDUCED BY 17% A FINAL POINT LET ME ADDRESS THE RECENT ISSUES REGARDING ATTORNEY THOMAS GIRARDI. WE TO AT THE BOARD WERE DISMAYED BY THE LAPSES IN INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION REVEALED BY OUR INDEPENDENT AUDIT AND CLOSE CASES REGARDING JORDAN AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO ACTION EVEN THOUGH MANY OF THE ISSUES IDENTIFIED IN THE AUDIT EXTEND BACK TWENTY YEARS OR MORE. SPECIFICALLY PLAN TO IMPLEMENT A NUMBER OF REFORMS TO TIGHTLY CONTROLLED BY CLIENT TRUST ACCOUNT. ROOF PROACTIVE DETECTION OF MISCONDUCT. SOME OF THE REFORMS WE'RE LOOKING AT. SEARCHES HIRING ACCOUNTING EXPERTS CAN DRILL INTO SUSPECT TRUST ACCOUNTS COST MONEY. WE CAN'T MAKE THOSE REFORMS WITHOUT STABLE FUNDING. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING AND I STAND READY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ALONG WITH LEAH WILSON ARE GOING TO DO AFTER THANK YOU. CORRECT THANK YOU SO IS THERE ANYONE HERE THE WHICH IN THE HEARING ROOM IN THE CHAMBERS WHO WANT TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. OF SB. TWO ELEVEN. SEEING NONE ANYONE IN THE ROUTE MODE TESTIMONY STATION. SEEING NONE HABITABLE LINES OPERATE WOULD YOU OPEN THE LINES FOR ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB TWO ELEVEN. TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB TWO ELEVEN PLEASE PRESS ONE AND ZERO AT THIS TIME. YOUR FIRST GO TO LINE THIRTY NINE GO AHEAD PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MR. CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GREGORY KRAMER ON THE HOUSE. THANK YOU. WE HAVE ONE OF THE LINE IN Q. ONE MOMENT WILL BE ASSIGNED THE LINE NUMBER. WE WILL OPEN UP ONE SIXTY FIVE GO AHEAD PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MISTER TURNER MEMBERS ASSISTING HOP ON BEHALF OF CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT OF SB TWO ELEVEN THANK YOU. MR HERE WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU TO MOVE TO THE PROPOSITION I DO NOT HAVE ANY SPECIFIC OPPOSITION WITNESSES LISTED IS THERE ANYONE HERE THE CHAMBERS WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF SB TWO ELEVEN. SEEING NONE REMOTE TESTIMONY STATION. SEEING NONE OPERATOR WHICH OF THE LINES FOR OPPOSITION FOR SB TWO ELEVEN. TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. MR SURELY WRESTLING QUEUING UP AT THIS TIME THANK YOU I AM GOING TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. MANY MEMBERS I WILL NOTE THAT. I KNOW THE BAR IS NOT HAPPY WITH THE MANDATE IN HERE OR THE REMOVAL OF THE FEES BASED ON THE. SELECTION AND THEN THE APPROPRIATE CONFIRMATION OF CHIEF TRUCK COUNCIL BUT I THINK THE- WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE SUPPORTING OUR SENATE COLLEAGUES AS THEY MOVE FORWARD AYE I WILL NOTE THAT OF COURSE CONFIRMATION IS IN THE HANDS SOLELY OF THE SENATE. SO AS LONG AS THERE'S A PROCESS AND THAT THE- CHAIR OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IS COMFORTABLE TO PROCESS THAT. I DO HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT IF WE MOVE THE BILL TODAY. THAT THOSE DISCUSSIONS WILL STILL GO ON AND I'M HOPING THAT. WE WILL THEN SEE THIS BILL- AMENDED BY TIME IT COMES TO THE FLOOR TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES SO I. I DO TAKE SERIOUSLY THE SENATE'S CONCERNS FOR A LACK OF CHIEF PROCK COUNCIL WE HAVE SEEN THIS COMMITTEE. HAS BEEN HIGHLY CRITICAL OF THE BAR OVER THE YEARS. AND THEIR INABILITY TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC AND THAT'S THE ROLE OF CHIEF TRIAL COUNSEL I'VE TALKED TO A NUMBER OF. THE EMPLOYEES AT THE BAR WHO ARE. EARLY RECENT HIRES OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WHO ARE DOING THE PROSECUTION'S AND THEY ARE DEAD SERIOUS ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND I TOLD THEM AS I TOLD THE BAR TRUSTEES I THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE THAT ATTORNEYS ARE A LITTLE NERVOUS WHEN THEY GET A CALL FROM THE BAR AND THAT. WE UP THE STANDARD. OF THAT LEVEL OF PROTECTION AND THAT. THAT CONCERN THAT ATTORNEYS SHOULD HAVE FOR BEING HAVING THEIR CONDUCT RVIEWED BY THE STATE BAR THAT'S THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE I THINK COLLECTIVELY ALONG WITH SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ARE TRYING TO. TO DO SO THAT IS WHY I'M RECOMMENDING THAT WE PASSED THE BILL HERE TODAY WE ARE STILL PART OF THE CONVERSATION WITH THE SENATE WITH THE BAR AND THE STAKEHOLDERS AND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE ARE ALL. ON THE SAME PAGE WITH RESPECT TO THIS BECAUSE THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT'S BEEN VERY IMPORTANT FOR OUR COMMITTEE AND FOR OR FOR MANAGING THE EXPECTATIONS AND THE BAR AND- SENATOR THERE WERE SOME THERE AMENDMENTS LISTED IN THE ANALYSIS WHO ARE TAKING THOSE MOMENTS AS OFFICE ABOUT IT YES I AM YES THANK YOU JUST TO CLEAR THAT UP. ALL RIGHT BUSINESS HOURS THANK YOU I'M COMPLETELY FINE WITH WHAT YOU'RE DOING WE'VE SEEN OVER THE YEARS UNFORTUNATELY. THAT THE BAR SEEMS TO ONLY. RESPOND TO US WHEN A- BAR DUES BILL IS UP AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S THE ONLY LEVERAGE WE HAVE IT SEEMS LIKE I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS NOW- I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY I HAVE A GENERAL RULE OF NOT. VOTING FOR THINGS WITH BLANKS IN THEM- AMOUNTS WE DON'T USUALLY LET ANYTHING OUT OF APPROPRIATIONS THAT WAY IT REALLY MAKES ME NERVOUS I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE INTENTION IS TO NOT- CHANGE THE LEVEL THE SO IT WILL READ THREE NINETY FIVE AND NINETY WHATEVER. THE AMOUNT IS FOR AN ACTIVE NINETY SEVEN FORTY THAT WOULD BE THAT IS THE NUMBERS THAT ARE INTENDED TO BE. PLACED BACK IN ONCE AN AGREEMENT IS MADE. THAT IS CORRECT OKAY. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE. NO THANK YOU- SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE I THANK YOU CHAIRMAN STONE- ARE YOU AND I SHARE CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROFESSION WE SHARE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BAR WE SHARE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BACKLOG WITH RESPECT DISPLAY CASES I THINK THE REASON AUDIT SHOWS THE LAST FIVE YEARS IT'S INCREASED BY EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT. BOB I HAVE BEEN IN CLOSE CONTACT AS YOU HAVE BEEN MISTER CHAIR WITH THE BAR HOWEVER I WAS STUNNED TO HEAR CHAIR SEELIG SAY THAT THEY'RE NT GOING TO HAVE A% NOMINEE THEY'VE ONLY HAD FIVE YEARS TO PRODUCE A NOMINEE TO HAVE THAT PERSON CONFIRMED BY THE SENATE- AND SO I'M I'M REALLY SORRY TO HEAR THAT REALLY SORRY TO HEAR THAT- I AM HOPEFUL I STILL REMAIN HOPEFUL THAT THE- NUMBER WILL BE PLACED BACK. INTO THE BILL OF I KNOW THAT THERE ARE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES THE STATE BAR WHO ARE PASSIONATE DEDICATED AND HARD WORKING AND DEDICATED FOR EXAMPLE TO MAKING SURE THAT CONSUMERS ARE PROTECTED AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO. IMPACT THEM BUT WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BAR IS A FUNCTIONING AS WE WOULD EXPECT TO URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THAT MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED. CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE HI STONE AYE GALLAGHER. CHAO CHOW I CHIU. DAVIES DAVIES I'D GONZALEZ. CONSULT I HOLDEN KALRA KALRA AYE KILEY MAIENSCHEIN REYES REYES AYE SIX SENATOR THE BILLS OUT. THEY NOW SHARE OUR ITEM NUMBER THREE SB. TWO FORTY ONE- THANK YOU AGAIN- CHAIR AND ONE OF TO GO THANK COMMITTEE STAFFER. NICHOLAS LIKE KEEP FOR YOUR HARD WORK AND HIS HARD WORKING YOUR STAFF'S HARD WORK ON THIS BILL- THE PANDEMIC HAS TAUGHT US A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT LESSONS ONE LESSONS THE PANDEMIC IS TAUGHT US IS THAT WE NEED TO BE AND WE CAN BE MORE EFFICIENT IN THE OPERATION. OF OUR COURTS IN THE SYSTEM AT THIS BILL DOES SEVERAL THINGS UP FIRST IT. ALLOWS COURT REPORTERS BOARD TO OVERSEE AND REGULATE SHORTHAND REPORTING SERVICES RENDERED BY OUT OF STATE COURT REPORTING FIRMS OF IT IS AKIN TO HAVING LOCAL COUNCIL HERE WHEN YOU HAVE OUT OF STATE COUNSEL APPEARING IN- IN OUR COURTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IT PERMITS A WITNESS N THIS OVERSEEING TO APPEAR GIVE TESTIMONY BY ELECTRONIC MEANS UP IF BOTH PARTIES STIPULATE OR UPON MOTION AND THERE'S CERTAIN CRITERIA THAT MET THE JUDGE FIND CERTAIN CRITERIA THEN SHE CAN PERMIT THAT WITNESS TO TESTIFY REMOTELY PROVIDES A GREAT DEAL OF EFFICIENCY NOT JUST BECAUSE THE COURT OPERATION BUT ALSO A COST SAVINGS. FOR EXAMPLE A CUSTODIAN OF RECORDS NEED NOT APPEAR IN PERSON IT'S REALLY MINISTERIAL WITNESS BUT SOMETIMES THOSE WITNESSES TAKE SOMETIME AND OFTENTIMES THEY'RE WAITING AROUND FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD. THREE COURTS TO ELECTRONICALLY SERVE COURT ISSUED DOCUMENTS- ON PARTIES HAVE CONSENTED THAT SERVICE I KNOW IT SOUNDS AMAZING BUT SOME COURTS TODAY IN CALIFORNIA DO NOT. SERVE NOTICES ELECTRONICALLY- AND- IT ALSO REQUIRES COURTS TO SCHEDULE A HEARING ON A PETITION FOR COMPROMISE OF MINERS CLAIM WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF THE DATE OF FILING. AND INSURES THAT ARBITRATION DEADLINES ARE TIMELY AND PREDICTABLE. I HAVE TWO WITNESSES WHO WERE ON THE PHONE TO TESTIFY- MISTER GREG RESULT OF WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER CONSUMER ATTORNEYS. AS WELL AS SYLVIA ARE GADDA EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF LEGAL AID FOUNDATION OF LOS ANGELES- DRIVE OUT. THANK YOU SENATOR I DO HAVE THOSE TWO WITNESSES GREGORY CEO AND SYLVIA ARE GOING TO. THE THREE ZERO. YES THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CRIED WITH DEAL ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA TESTIFYING AS A CO SPONSOR OF SB TWO FORTY ONE TODAY WILL BE SPEAKING ON THE REMOTE LIVE WITH THIS PORTION OF THE BILL. SB TWO FORTY ONE IS SUPPORTED BY BOTH PLAINTIFF AND DEFENSE ATTORNEYS AS IT HELPS IN BOTH QUARTERS SUFFICIENCY WHILE PROMOTING PUBLIC SAFETY. LIKE SO MANY OTHER PROFESSIONS THIS PANDEMIC HAS CREATED SERIOUS ISSUES IN OUR COURTS AND CASES FACE HERE'S WHAT THE BACKLOG DUE TO THE CLOSURES. SO NOW'S THE PERFECT TIME TO INTRODUCE MEASURES LIKE SB TWO FORTY ONE TO HELP MAKE TRIALS MORE EFFICIENT WHICH WILL HELP REDUCE THE BACKLOG. IN TRIAL MANY TIMES ATTORNEYS LIKE MYSELF HAVE TO CALL WITNESSES TO PROVIDE BASIC FOUNDATIONAL TESTIMONY. FOR EXAMPLE WHEN I'M IN TRIAL IN AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT. THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I HAVE TO CALL. A E. AND G. BECAUSE MY MEDICAL EXPERTS HAVE TO RELY UPON. THEIR FINDINGS OF MY CLIENTS LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN OTHER WORDS THE GLASS CAL SCHOOL ARE. AT THE SCENE. EVEN IF NO ONE DISPUTES WHAT THE GLASS CAL SCORE WAS. UNFORTUNATELY MANY TIMES I'VE SEEN THOSE EMTS FORCED INTO COMING TO COURT TO TESTIFY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WORK SHIFT TO PROVIDE AN UNDISPUTED CLASSICAL SCORE. DNT LIE PRESENCE MEANS THAT THEY MIGHT BE SITTING IN THE COURTHOUSE HALLWAY FOR THREE TO FIVE HOURS OF THEIR SHIP WHILE WAITING TO PROVIDE THAT TESTIMONY. HAVING A P. AND G. IN COURT TO PROVIDE AN UNDISPUTED CLASSIC CAL SCORE. IS BELOW THE WAIST OF HIS IN HER TIME. AND A PUBLIC SAFETY HAZARD AS HE OR SHE SHOULD BE OUT. OUR COMMUNITIES SAVING LIVES. THIS DILEMMA ALL OCCURS POLICE OFFICERS TREATING. THIS BILL THANKS TO THAT DILEMMA AND ALLOW THE CRITICAL PUBLIC SAFETY PROFESSIONS TO SIMPLY TAKE THREE TO FIVE MINUTES IN THEIR OFFICES REMOTELY. INSTEAD OF OUR STRIVING TO IN SITTING IN COURTROOMS. NO I UNDERSTAND THERE'S BEEN SOME CONCERN THE JURORS MIGHT HAVE A HARD TIME HEARING WITNESSES MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO PRESERVE THE RECORD FOR APPEAL. AS WELL ON TRIAL OUR PARTY YEARS THAT DO NOT SHARE THIS CONCERN. ALL TRIAL LAWYERS KNOW THAT IT IS THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT THE CLIENT THE BALLOT RIGHT AND THE JUDGES ALSO HAVE THE SAME OBLIGTION. SO THIS A BILL SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES THOSE CONCERNS. BY PROVIDING THE TRIAL JUDGE THE POWER TO SAY NO IF THEY BELIEVE THAT THAT'S AN ISSUE IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL COURTHOUSE. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT A MEMBER THAT WE JUST AS THE ATTORNEYS HAVE BEEN MAKING TELEPHONICALLY APPEARANCES TO THE CORE CALL SYSTEM FOR MANY YEARS WITH NO SUCH PROBLEMS. IN CLOSING SB TWO FORTY ONE HELPS KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFER. AND ALSO MAKES THE TRIAL PROCESS MORE EFFICIENT WHICH WILL HELP US CATCH UP ON THE SIGNIFICANT BACKLOG. THESE CASES NEED TO GET TO TRIAL THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO GET THEM THERE AS SUCH WE URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU AND I WILL REMAIN ON THE LINE IN CASE THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS. AND WE'LL MOVE TO SYLVIA R. GRETA. HELLO GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS SO THE IDEA THAT I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE LEGAL AID FOUNDATION OF LOS ANGELES BLACKLICK CREEK A SUPPORT SENATE BILL TWO FORTY ONE I DID NOT- SEVERAL COURT EFFICIENCIES THAT WOULD MAKE- URGENTLY NEEDED REFORMS- IMPROVEMENT TO THE CURRENT COURT SYSTEM REDUCE COSTS TO THE COURTS AND LITIGANTS LET THEM TRIALLING AND QUICKEN TRIAL CASE. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY INTEGRATE. COMMONLY USED TECHNOLOGY. WANT TO A QUIET MUST INCLUDE GUIDED AND SAVE. IN SHARE THAT MORE VULNERABLE KEY ARE LEFT. PROBABLY NOT BE MADE WITH LOW INCOME LITIGANTS FRONT AND CENTER. THE NORM SHOULD BE THAT CHANGES ARE MADE WHEN THEY BENEFIT EVERYONE ESPECIALLY LOW INCOME AMERICANS. PORTENO PRACTICES DURING THE PANDEMIC THE FACT THAT FACILITATED AFTER SUGGESTED SHOULD CONTINUE IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL FOR ACTIVE LOW INCOME LAWYERS- TO SEE THAT THESE PRACTICES RPGS. SOME OF THE REFORMS ARE NEEDED IMMEDIATELY IN ORDER FOR THE COURTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MINIMIZE. NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON LOW INCOME CLIENTS ESPECIALLY COURT CHALLENGES WITH TECHNOLOGY ISSUES BUT WHO HAVE MARK STONE AFTER COURT HEARING AND THE TO SIGN DOCUMENTS. THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE HELPED OUR CLIENTS ENSURE THAT THEY- AFFECT THE COURTHOUSE DOORS ARE NOT SHUT SIMPLY BECAUSE- THEY ARE POOR.

BUT GIVEN THE FACT THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS OPENED THE DOORS TO REMOTE THERE IS STILL A LOT OF PROBLEMS AND I THINK OPENING- OF BILLS THAT WOULD. AND TESTIMONY IS PUTTING THE FOR OF THAT THE CARD THE I HONEST THINK THAT WHAT THE INFORMATION THAT ARE INTERPRETER HAVE- ME MYSELF FOURTEEN IN MADERA SUPERIOR COURT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO INTERPRET AND TO PROVIDE SERVICES REMOTELY- NOT ONLY IS TECHNOLOGY UNRELIABLE BUT THE WAY IT HAS TO MONNING IS GIVEN SOMETIMES IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO CONTROL. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DETAIN AND STOP SOMEBODY- OFTEN TIMES- WHAT ARE. THAT AGAIN HASTINGS THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO WE OUGHT TO SEE IF. HELPING WITH TESTIMONY WE ALSO SEE FAMILY PROVIDING DOCUMENTS THAT ARE SHOULD NOT BE LOOKED AT- AND IT'S JUST KEEP VERY CHAOTIC- A LOT OF THE TIMES THERE IS A HUGE DIGITAL DIVIDE WERE WE SEE OURSELVES REPRESENTATIVE OR PEOPLE WHO ARE REPRESENTATIVE BY SOME TYPE OF LEGAL AID OR ANYTHING UP YOUR IN SUPPORT OF. OUR OUR FIRM JOHN AND WE ARE MEETING WE ARE. I'M SORRY HELLO I I'M SORRY YEAH OPERATOR. SOMEBODY'S NOT ON MUTE IT IS VERY IT GETS DESERVE ARE TRYING TO. WE ARE TRYING TO ISOLATE THAT LINE. THANK YOU VERY. YOU PUT OF. AND IF YOU HAD THANK YOU SO ON I'M OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE- HERE IN PERSON WITH THE SHE DIGITAL USUALLY P. THAT ARE INDIGENT. THEY APPEAR HERE IN PERSON WILDER DARK REMOTELY OFF IN THE COMMENTS THAT WE GET IS I CAN'T EVEN TALK TO MY ATTORNEY I CAN'T TELL THEM ANYTHING THAT ISN'T TRUE ESPECIALLY DURING TESTIMONY THERE IS NO WAY FOR THEM OR MECHANISM FOR THEM TO BE HELPING AND AIDING THEIR ATTORNEY AND A LOT OF THE TESTIMONY THAT IS BEING GIVEN ESPECIALLY WHEN THE TURNING CIRCLE APPEARING REMOTELY. I EVEN HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF ACTUALLY WATCHING A LITIGANT SO FRUSTRATED WITH HIS ATTORNEY FIRE IS ATTORNEY IN OPEN COURT INTERESTS WAS YELLING AND SAYING HOW FRUSTRATED HE WAS THAT THE IN THE TURNING WAS NOT THERE A- MA'AM I THINK IT'S AROUND. LIKE THIS. I NEED TWENTY THREE- I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT. I THINK THIS KIND OF BILL MORE SUITED OMETHING IS LOW. PATTERSON THE HIGH STATE HIGH OF DEAL WITH FLY CAN CHANGED DEPENDING ON THE- GIVEN IF THERE'S NO COULD. THAN PEOPLE WHO LIVE SHE- LIFE ARE HAVE I NEED TO. PLACE CAN BE. I AM WRAPPING ABSURD I UP AND I APPRECIATE YOU GUYS GIVE ME THAT. BUT THIS TYPE OF- BILL IS. BETTER SUITED FOR SOMETHING THAT IS LOW STEAKS AND EVEN SOME OF THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. COULD NOT REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS AND WE WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS THIS FURTHER THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT OPERATOR WOULD YOU DO YOU HAVE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO INDICATE OPPOSITION AND WE WILL NOT BE TAKING FURTHER TESTIMONY. WILL TAKE NAME AFFILIATE GROUPS AND OPPOSITION. WE HAVE THREE MORE LINES IN Q. WILL GO NEXT TO LINE NINETY SIX. HI MY NAME IS HELEN ST ONE AT THE S. R. ONE THREE FOUR SEVEN SIX. PROUD SUPPORTER PROTECTOR RECORD PROJECT AND I STRONGLY OPPOSE THANK YOUNG. LINE. SEVENTY TWO. I MANY SANDY WALTON NOTHING POPS PRESIDENT'S WITH STEVE KERR A CALIFORNIA REPORTERS ASSOCIATION I STRONGLY OPPOSE EVEN WITH THE CURRENT AMENDMENTS THE BILL NEEDS. TO BE NARROWED THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BY. ONE OH ONE. HI THERE MY NAME IS DEAR FROM ARE THURGOOD CARE PROJECT AND THERE'S NO MONEY ALLOCATED IN THE STATE BUDGET HEY AM SORRY FONG CAN UNDERTAKE FURTHER DENNIS HURLEY THANK YOU. TYING UP. THERE ARE LOWER THE LINES INTO SIR I THINK YOU YOU MAY CLOSE THE LINES THEN OPERATED I'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE RETIREMENT SB TWO FORTY ONE QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MISTER KALRA MR TO THINK- THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU SENATOR FOR BRING THIS FORWARD AND FOR IT'S A LOT OF WORK IN CONVERSATIONS BEEN OCCURRING- WITH THE WITH OPPOSITION I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF. PROGRESS NOT REGARD AND I DID THAT THE TWO AREAS OF CONTINUED TO CONCERNED LINE AND I NOTICED THAT YOU CONVERSATION THAT YOU'RE HAVING- ARE ARE THE- ACCESS ISSUES- PARTICULARLY AS IT APPLIES TO INDIGENT LITIGANTS BUT ALSO- YOU KNOW WITH HAVING SPENT ON A LOT OF TIME IN COURT ROOMS- I DO WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE INTEGRITY OF THE COURT REPORTING SYSTEM AND WHAT THEY BRING TO THE TABLE AS RECOGNIZE BUT- ON ON ON THAT NOTE. I'VE HAD A JUST SOLUTION THE PAST OF THAT- HAS GREATER BECAUSE GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY FOR OUT OF STATE COURT REPORTERS AND SO MY WORRY WOULD BE THAT WE WOULD BE HELPING TO FACILITATE A FLOOD OF OUT OF STATE REPORTERS THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE OUR BOARD DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION OVER HOWEVER THAT WAS PART OF BUT MY PREVIOUS LEGISLATION BOB HAD TO AIM TO DEAL WITH. AND SO AS THIS- A IN A BUBBLE LEGISLATION MOVES FORWARD- YOU KNOW THAT WOULD BE AN AREA OF GREAT CONCERN OF MINE IS TO MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT OPENING THE FLOODGATES- BECAUSE AGAIN IF IT'S ABOUT IT'S ABOUT EFFICIENCY WHAT HAVE YOU THAT'S ONE THING BUT IT BUT WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN THAT INTEGRITY AND THE REALITY IS THAT I YOU KNOW HOW TO GET MY STUDY AND DO NOT BILL OTHER STATES MANY OTHER STATES DON'T HAVE THE SAME DEGREE OF OVERSIGHT THAT WE DO AND I THINK THAT'S- THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN- MAIN TO MAINTAIN THE ABILITY TO HAD A VERY DIRECT OVERSIGHT. OVER THOSE THAT ARE PROVIDING THESE SERVICES EVEN IF AND ESPECIALLY IF IT'S REMOTELY AND SO- THOSE. ARE SOME OF THE ISSUES- I WANTED TO RAISE AS AN- AS YET. AND YOU'RE OUT YOU YOUR OFFICE AND THEN CONTINUE- CONVERSATIONS ON THE OTHERS A TRAILER BILL AS WELL OF DIFFERENT. MOVING PARTS JOURNAL- OF OUR OUR CHAIR OF THE STATE AND HIS TEAM ALL INVOLVED IN WORKING. A LONG. A TO DEAL WITH LEASES BUDGET WANTED TO REYES ISSUE OF. STATE OF A CORE OF THAT- ALL WORRY WHEN WE KIND OF CREATE THAT. THANK YOU. MISTER SHALL REST. YOU MAY NOT. THANK YOU SO IN THE KALRA- COUPLE THOUGHTS OF FIRST I HEARD TESTIMONY SANCHEZ SYRTIS IS ACCURATE AND TO OF THE STATE OF COMMERCE STATED SCOTT- SO IN TERMS OUT OF STATE COURT REPORTERS IN RIGHT NOW AS WE STAND OR SIT HERE TODAY THERE'S PROBABLY A HUNDRED DEPOSITIONS GOING ON OUT OF STATE CURRENTLY BEING- TRANSCRIBED OR AT LEAST- REPORTED BY OUT OF STATE COURT REPORTERS. UP WITH THIS BILL DOES IS IT ADDS SOME ACCOUNTABILITY BY REQUIRING THOSE OUT OF STATE FIRMS TO ACTUALLY HAVE LOCAL OF A LOCAL FIRM UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A COURT REPORTER BOARD SO I THINK IT'S AN IMPROVEMENT IN TERMS OF YOUR CONCERN ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY- UP WITH RESPECT TO THE ACCURACY OF THE RECORD. THERE'S NO ONE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE ACCURACY THE RECORD THEN THE LAWYERS WHO REPRESENT THE LITIGANTS NO ONE UP MAYBE THE JUDGE SHE MAY BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE RECORD BUT BUT ALL THE PARTIES. AND WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET AN ACCURATE RECORD- I HEARD WAS ALSO SAID WITH RESPECT TO- INTERPRETERS IN REPRESENTATION OF INDIGENTS THAT IS A CONTINUING ISSUE OF THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE REPRESENTATION OF INDIGENTS. AS A- JUST A FACT IT IS DIFFICULT FOR INDIGENCE TO RECEIVE ADEQUATE COUNSEL- AND THEN ONCE THEY DO HAVE COUNCIL IN TERMS OF THE WAY TO REPRESENT THEM EFFECTIVELY. IS A CONTINUING CONCERN AND THOSE CONCERNS WITH RESPECT TO- INTERPRETERS IN TRANSLATION EXIST EVEN WHEN. LITIGANTS APPEAR PERSONALLY IN THE COURTROOM. THIS WILL REQUIRE THE JUDGE YOU'LL HAVE TO BE UP A BIT MORE OBSERVANT PERHAPS WITH REMOTE TESTIMONY BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE SHOULDN'T DO IT AND N. AS IS ILLUSTRATED BY THE NUMBERS IF YOU LOOK AT THE SUPPORTERS. OF THE BILL THOSE WHO DO REPRESENT INDIGENTS WHETHER IT'S THE ALLIANCE FOR CHILDREN'S RIGHTS BEAR LEGAL AID CHILDREN'S LAWCENTER DEPENDENCY LEGAL SERVICES THE JOHN BURTON ADVOCATES FOR YOUTH. IT'S SET TRADE CENTER AT CETERA THEY ALL RECOGNIZE THAT THAT THIS IS A STEP TO HELP THEM MORE EFFICIENTLY REPRESENT INDIGENTS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU RIGHT MISTER TO AND THEN AS OUR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR TACKLING THIS A CHALLENGING TOPIC OF HOW WE ADDRESS BACKLOGS PARTICULAR DURING THIS PANDEMIC BUT IT SURE- THAT ALL THE VALUES THAT WE CARE ABOUT IN OUR COURT SYSTEM ARE SUPPORTED AND AS EXPRESSED WHEN I VOTED FOR THIS BILL IN ASSEMBLY BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS- I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR ENGAGEMENT WITH THIS YEAR YOU AND SOME OF THE OPPOSITION TO IT TO GET TO A BETTER SPOT. HE PARTIALLY ANSWERED THE QUESTION HAS BEEN RAISED BUT I'D LIKE TO JUST PUSH A LITTLE FARTHER- I DO PLAN TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY- I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE STILL CONCERNS ABOUT. HOW WE ADDRESS THE SITUATION AROUND INDIGENT REPRESENTATION. I'M COULD YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF SORT OF WHERE'S THE DISCUSSION AT THIS POINT ON WHAT AMENDMENTS COULD BE TAKEN- CAN WHERE WHERE WHERE THE DIFFERENT PARTIES AND WHAT WE TRY TO BRIDGE AT THIS POINT I'M- I'M NOT ASKING FOR- FINALLY ANSWERS I'M JUST ASKING FOR A SENSE OF WHAT ARE THE ISSUES THAT. YOU'RE STILL TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH SO WE CAN- CONSIDERED CONTINUED A CONSIDERATE AND THINK ABOUT IT. I THINK THAT. THE CONCERNS THAT ARE RAISED WITH RESPECT TO INDIGENCE- THERE THERE IS SOME DISAGREEMENT AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THIS PROVIDES ADDITIONAL SERVICES THE GROUPS WHO REPRESENT INDIGENTS- ALMOST UNIVERSALLY TAKE THE POSITION THAT. THIS IS AN ADVANTAGE SO LET ME GIVE YOU A FEW EXAMPLES. IF YOU'RE AN INDIGENT AND YOU SIMPLY WANT TO CONTINUE WEEK TRIAL DATE THE NEW LIVE A HUNDRED MILES FROM THE COURTHOUSE. AND YOU SHOW UP AT LEGAL AID YOU CAN APPEAR REMOTELY WITH COUNSEL. RATHER THAN TAKING A DAY OFF OF WORK AND DRIVING OF THE COURTHOUSE OF WAITING AROUND TO YOUR CASES CALL- AND SO I BELIEVE IT ACTUALLY. SAVES ONE IS SAYS INDIGENTS MONEY BUT TO A PROVIDES A MORE EFFICIENT REPRESENTATION REQUIRING SOMEONE TO APPEAR PERSONALLY IN COURT. FOR MANY PURPOSES IS SIMPLY NOT USEFUL. THE THAT YOU CAN APPEAR. REMOTELY AND HANDLE. SIR PRE TRIAL PROBABLY 80% OF WHAT IS BEING- DISPUTED AT THE TIME SO. I'M NOT SURE- I A HEARD AGAIN WHAT MS SANCHEZ HAD TO SAY AND I THINK WE RESOLVED OR WILL RESOLVE. THOSE CONCERNS IN TERMS OF INDIGENT REPRESENTATION WE MAY JUST HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION. THE FOLKS THAT REPRESENT INDIGENTS LARGELY AGREE WITH US. OTHERS DISAGREE. I APPRECIATE THAT AND YOU KNOW CERTAINLY I THINK FOR MANY OF US PARTICULARLY DURING THIS TIME PERIOD- I THINK WE ARE EXPECTING THESE ISSUES ENVOLVE AND LOWER INCOME- PARTIES TO REALLY SKYROCKET- AND- I THINK RESOLVING THIS IS IMPORTANT. MY HOPE IS I THINK THE EXAMPLE YOU JUST GAVE IS A- VERY CLEAR ONE OF ONE WHERE SOMEONE WHO'S LOWER INCOME COULD REALLY BENEFIT FROM THAT I'M HOPING THAT WE'RE GONNA MAYBE PRESCRIBE TO THAT BUT- LOOK FOR TO THE ONGOING CONVERSATION REALLY HOPE TO. TO GET UPDATED AS THIS BILL CONTINUES ON THAT FRONT. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU THIS GONZALEZ. I AS I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE NO AMENDMENTS TODAY AND I UNDERSTAND THERE'S A LOT OF MOVING PARTS BUT I JUST WANNA TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY EXPRESSED MY CONCERNS- I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AND I'LL- I UNDERSTAND THERE WOULD BE. THEIR GOOD ARGUMENTS FOR THAT BUT I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED- AND NOT SO MUCH YOU BUT HAVING SPOKEN TO A LOT OF SITES. HOW DID THREE GUARDED- THE PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE DOING THE WORK OF INTERPRETING COURT REPORTING ARE IN THIS CONVERSATION. SO VERY CLOSE WITH CONSUMER JOURNEYS I FELT LIKE THEY WERE VERY- THIS WORKS FOR EVERYBODY THAT'S WHAT THEY KEPT SAYING THIS IS GREAT IT WORKS FOR EVERYBODY WELL IF IT DOESN'T WORK FOR THE WORKERS DOING. THE JOB IT DOESN'T WORK FOR EVERYBODY. AND SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE'RE MOVING FORWARD THE INTERPRETERS IN PARTICULAR I'M NOT SURE HOW THIS CAN WORK. WE JUST SAW I MEAN WITH THE TESTIMONY WHAT HAPPENS OBVIOUSLY IN REMOTE SETTINGS- AND I'M GOING TO ASSUME THAT THE COURTS. ARE IN A BETTER POSITION TO MANAGE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE CONTINUE TO SEE. THEM I CATCH MAYBE. FOUR FIFTHS OF THE WORDS THAT ARE SAID- AND I'M VERY CONSCIENTIOUS OF THAT BECAUSE I'M DYSLEXIC AND WHEN I READ THAT'S ABOUT WHAT I READ AT THE SAME TIME ABOUT FOUR FIFTHS AND I HAVE TO GO BACK AND GO BACK IF YOU CAN'T GO BACK IT MAKES IT REALLY HARD TO PROCESS- EXACT INFORMATION AND SOME OF THE STORIES I HEARD FROM COURT REPORTERS- IT REALLY BASED ON GETTING PIECES IN TRYING TO INTERRUPT AND SAY I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING AND BEING DISREGARDED AGAIN WHICH I BELIEVE GIVEN. HOW MUCH THEY'VE BEEN DISREGARDED BY SOME IN THIS CONVERSATION THAT THAT PROBABLY DOES HAPPEN TO THEM YOU KNOW I CAN'T HEAR AND PEOPLE KEEP GOING SOUTH I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE- TAKING THEIR CONCERNS SERIOUSLY AND- ADDRESSING THEM IN WHATEVER FORM AS IT MOVES FORWARD AND WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- CONVENIENCE DOESN'T SUPERSEDE AT WHAT REALLY SHOULD BE- THE NUMBER ONE CONCERN WITH IT WHICH IS AN ACCURATE RECORD- INTERPRETING WHICH IS MAKING SURE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON IN THEIR LANGUAGE OF CHOICE. IN THE COURTROOM SO- BUT I DO GIVE YOU MUCH CREDIT TO TAKE ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS THAT WE ALSO KNOW WE HAVE A BACKLOG AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET THROUGH IT SO- KUDOS TO YOU FOR TAKING THE PHONE I LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU SPECIFICALLY. ON THOSE ON TWO ISSUES. I THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. ISRAEL THANK YOU I ALSO WANT TO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK WITH SEIU I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE VERY WORKERS FOR DOING THE FOR. WE DO KNOW THAT THIS PANDEMIC IS SHOWN THAT WE DO NEED TO LOOK AT SOMETHING DIFFERENT. TO HAVING TO TAKE THE SUN IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. THE INTERPRETERS UNFORTUNATELY WITH THEIR TESTIMONY WAS VERY IMPORTANT I DIDN'T SEE A LETTER OF OPPOSITION. SO I HAD NO CONTEXT IN THAT REGARD TO WITH THE COMMENTS WERE VERY IMPORTANT- I THINK THAT WITH OUR OUR COURT REPORTERS HAVING THEM WITH THE HEARING OFFICER THE JUDGE. I APPRECIATE THAT THAT'S ONE OF THOSE AMENDMENTS IT'S GOING TO BE TAKEN. BECAUSE THAT IS- SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE. THE CORNERSTONE OF WHAT WE DO IS ATTORNEYS MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE HEARING OFFICER AND THE CORE PART OF MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE AN ACCURATE RECORD. OF BUT AGAIN I AT MOST IMPORTANTLY I THINK HAVING YOU WORK IN THE SPACE AND ENGAGING ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS AS YOU HAVE- I THINK. IT LENDS FOR BETTER LEGISLATION BUT I KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE OTHER STEPS ALONG THE WAY. AND I AM GLAD. AGAIN FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE VERY PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING AT THIS THE COURT ORDERS AND NOW HEARING THE INTERPRETERS OF BLOOD BUT THEY. DID CALL AND- THANK YOU. THANK YOU. RIGHT SIX. THE CHAIRMAN- YOU KNOW ONE ONE ISSUE THAT CAME UP- I THINK FROM THE COURT RECORDS IS A COURT REPORTERS ASSOCIATION IS- THE REGISTRATION IS ONE THING I THINK THAT DOES PROVIDE THE OVERSIGHT AND SUPERVISION- BUT THEY WERE SAYING THAT THE CURRENT STATUTE AS IT'S DRAFTED APPLIES MOSTLY TO SITUATIONS WHERE WE'RE A LICENSED CERTIFIED SHORTHAND REPORTER IS THE OWNER- OF THE BUSINESS AND SO- THE ASSOCIATION IS CONCERNED THERE MAY BE GAPS IN THAT STATUTE. THAT COULD BE USED BY KIND OF THE OUT OF STATE CORPORATIONS TO GET AROUND. THE CURRENT STATUTORY STRUCTURE. AND MAYBE AND MAYBE THEY SAY THEY'RE APPLYING OR THEY'LL SAY THAT THAT STATUTE DOESN'T APPLY TO THEM. BECAUSE THE SHORT THE CERTIFIED SHORTHAND REPORTER IS NOT THE OWNER. AS A COULD YOU MAY RESPOND TO SOME OF THOSE CONTINUE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS THAT THE INTENT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT. IF YOU'RE AN OUT OF STATE REPORTER REPORTING IN A CALIFORNIA CASE THAT THERE IS A LOCAL REPORTING FIRM THAT HAS RESPONSIBILITY SO FOR EXAMPLE IF. YOU DO SOMETHING THAT IS CONTRARY TO- EITHER. OUR LAWS ARE STANDARDS THAT THAT THERE IS A LOCAL- THROAT TO CHOKE AS IT WERE- AND SO THAT THE COURT HAS THE ABILITY TO FOR EXAMPLE- MAKE SURE THAT THE THAT. THE RECORD IS ACCURATE NUMBER ONE WITH RESPECT TO DEPOSITIONS INTO THAT IF THERE'S SOMETHING UNTOWARD THAT HAPPENS THERE'S AN ABILITY TO YOU KNOW RAIN IN AT LEAST IF THERE IS A GAP WE WILL LOOK TO SEE IF WE CAN CLOSE THAT GAP BUT THAT'S THE INTENT. AND YOUR INTENT WITH THIS BILL IS TO ENSURE THAT THEY WOULD BE HELD ALL THE SAME. STATUTORY RULES AS WOOD- YOU KNOW THE SMALL. BUSINESS HEARING CALIFORNIA THAT'S OWNED BY A SHORTHAND REPORTER WELL. THAT THAT'S A LITTLE BROAD I'M NOT SURE THAT AN OUT OF STATE COURT REPORTING FIRM WOULD HAVE TO YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE DEAL WITH WORKERS COMPENSATION SOME OTHER CALIFORNIA REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE APPLIED TO SMALL BUSINESSES NOW- IN TERMS OF THE ACCURACY OF THE RECORD YES. YEAH BUT IN TERMS OF THE SPECIFICS OF- I HAVE CONDUCTED. YOUR DPOSITIONS ENSURE INTERNS OF GUILT SWEARING THE WITNESS IN THE OATH THAT IS ADMINISTERED IN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS YES. AND THEN I THINK YOU KNOW AND OBVIOUSLY THIS IS BEEN BROUGHT UP A LOT ABOUT THE REMOTE TESTIMONY- I THINK FOR A LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME- THAT MAKES SENSE WELL IN IT AND I AND I WRITE THAT UNDER THE- UNDER YOUR BILL IT'S ONLY IF ALL PARTIES HAVE AGREED. TO DO REMOTE THAT IS RIGHT THAT'S THE MOST COMMON CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE PARTIES STIPULATE- A. B. OF THE REPRESENTATIVE CAN MAKE A MOTION IN THE COURT CAN- PERMIT REMOTE TESTIMONY THERE'S A SERIES OF FACTORS THAT THE COURT MUST CONSIDER. SO THERE'S A STIPULATION OR IF THE COURT ORDERS IT. YEAH THAT'S CORRECT UPON MOTION WILL PARTY RIGHT AND I MAY BE A MOTION THE COURT BUT I'M SURE IT'S MOTION PARTY. I AM FOR THAT LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME I THINK THAT'S YOU KNOW SUPPORTABLE AND WHERE YOU HAVE WHERE IT IS EITHER COURT ORDER BY STIPULATION- BUT I DO FEEL THAT IN PERSON TESTIMONY IS THE BEST YOU KNOW BOTH. FOR THE RECORD BUT YOU KNOW- MORE GOING TO COURT TO RESOLVE ISSUES. YOU KNOW PEOPLE SHOULD BE IN PERSON AND IN YOUR FOR PROVIDING TESTIMONY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. I THINK THAT SHOULD BETHE CASE SO I MEAN I DON'T WANT TO GET TOO FAR AWAY FROM THAT BUT I THINK FOR THESE FOR THIS LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME IN UNDER THOSE. CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THAT DOES SEEM TO. BE REASONABLE MAKE SENSE HERE. TO THAT'S ALL I HAVE MISTER TERM THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE. THANK YOU CENA SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AT AND THANKS FOR THE COMMENTS- THANK YOU- MR IS THE- THANK YOU MISTER GET OF FOR YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY- AND I APPRECIATE THE MISS SANCHEZ- WE'VE HAD. CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE- ADDRESS THE SERIOUS INTEREST OF THE COURT REPORTERS- WE- WITH RESPECT TO INTERPRETERS- WE NEED TO MAKE SURE AND WE WILL THAT INTERPRETERS HAVE THE SAME ABILITY TO NOTIFY THE COURTS OF THE THAT THE COURT. CAN FOR EXAMPLE IF INTERPRETATION IS BECOMING- SO CHALLENGING THAT THE RECORD IS NOT ACCURATE THAT THEY COULD PAUSE THE PROCEED THAT THE COURT CAN THEN PAUSED THE PROCEEDINGS SO THAT WE DO HAVE AN ACTIVE RECORD THERE ARE SAFETY THOUSAND IN IN THE BILL. IF FOR EXAMPLE A TECHNOLOGY BREAKS DOWN- THEN. OF THE COURT NEED PAUSE- I A CONFIDENT FOR MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT. COURTHOUSE TECHNOLOGY IS SUPERIOR OUR TECHNOLOGY HERE- COURTROOMS ARE SMALLER IN THE ACOUSTICS ARE TYPICALLY BETTER THAN IN THIS ROOM- APPEARED MANY TIMES NEVER IS A CAT FORTUNATELY. ARE BUT THIS THIS IS MISTER IS YOU POINT OUT THIS IS SOMETHING WITH RESPECT TO COURT CALLS BEEN GOING ON FOR MANY MANY MANY YEARS. AND I THINK ULTIMATELY IT WILL CREATE GREATER EFFICIENCIES AND I THINK GREATER BENEFIT TO THE LITIGANTS WHETHER THEIR INTENTIONS OR OR OTHERWISE- GINGIVAL. THANK YOU I AM LOOKING FOR A MOTION. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THAT MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. DOWN BY STONE AYE GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER AYE CHAU CHAU AYE CHU CHU AYE DAVIES.

AND PAYING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS HOPING THAT THEIR YOU KNOW THEIR CHILDREN OR TEENS ARE GOING INTO THE RIGHT PLACE SO- I I'M REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THIS AND I WOULD LOVE TO CO AUTHOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER KALRA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU CENTER FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I AGREE IS LONG OVERDUE- AS YOU KNOW WELL AS A PUBLIC DEFENDER YOU MAY NOT KNOW HOW TO LIVE IN YEARS. OF THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE I SPENT ABOUT OFTEN ON FIVE AND A HALF YEARS OF THAT TIME IN DRUG COURT- AND TO YOUR POINT IN YOUR INTRO MOST OF THOSE- THE PROVIDE TREATMENT DO SO ETHICALLY WITH COMPASSION BUT MANY OF THOSE PROVIDING THE TREATMENT- ARE RECOVERY THEMSELVES AND ARE PAYING IT FORWARD. AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING TO SEE BUT- WITH THAT THERE ARE ALSO THAN SCRUPULOUS ACTORS AND DOES IT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FAMILIES IN A VERY VULNERABLE THE MOST VULNERABLE MOMENT THE OTHER ALLIES IN MANY CASES WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO- PROTECT THEIR LOVED ONE- AND- YOU KNOW I I'M I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS BILL GOING FORWARD AND SEEING. MOVING FOR WHAT ELSE WE CAN DO TO PROTECT THEM THESE FAMILIES ESPECIALLY AS AS INDICATED WITH THE RISE IN ADDICTION AND SO MANY ISSUES AND ANXIETY THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN OUR WORLD IN GENERAL I THINK THAT- BUT WHENEVER THERE'S A- WE- NEVER THERE'S- PEOPLE THINK ABOUT. OF THAT PAIN. AND SO I APPRECIATE FOR. ABOUT SOME UPPER. TO PUT. ABA INDIVIDUAL IN OUR STATE THAT ARE GOING. THROUGH A LOT RIGHT NOW INSIDE ALSO. OF THE BE- WE WOULD LIKE TO GO TO JOIN AS A PRINCIPAL AUTHOR. IF YOU SO CHOOSE THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS THIS GALLAGHER. THANK YOU SENATOR AND- CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE INTENT BEHIND THIS AND- WE'VE HAD LEGISLATION OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS- HERE RECENTLY TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF THE BAD ACTORS OUT THERE AS SOBER LIVING HOUSES FOR EXAMPLE THAT WE'RE NOT REALLY OPERATING WITH ANY KIND OF OVERSIGHT- YOU KNOW COMES TO MIND- COUPLE THING I'M THAT I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS THOUGH- WITH THIS BILL ONE ONE ISSUE THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP IS. WE CURRENTLY HAVE PROVIDERS WHO ARE ALREADY REGULATED- BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES- AND ONE ISSUE HAS BEEN YOU KNOW MAYBE EXEMPTING THEM FROM THIS BILL BECAUSE THEY'RE ALREADY OVERSEEN- HAVE TO FALL. YOU KNOW THE REGULATIONS AND STATE LAWS. THERE'S ALSO THEY ALSO HAVE ENFORCEMENT A DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS THROUGH. DH CS AND BY THE COUNTIES- WHICH WAS THE WHICH WITH A CONTRACT- YOU HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT EXEMPTING NOW THIS THIS PORTION OF THE INDUSTRY THAT IS ALREADY PRETTY HIGHLY REGULATED- THANK YOU SEWER I HAVEN'T THOUGHT MUCH ABOUT IT BUT MY INCLINATION WOULD BE NOT TO EXEMPT THEM OUT. OKAY AND WHY WOULD THAT BE. WELL I IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET OUT THE BAD ACTORS IS WHAT I'M TRYING WELL WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PATIENTS UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A BILL OF RIGHTS THAT THEY AND THEIR FAMILIES HAVE A RIGHT TO CERTAIN. ETHICAL STANDARDS IN TREATMENT AND THAT. SHOULD APPLY TO EVERYONE. ARE THERE ARE DEFICIENCIES IN THE REGULATIONS RIGHT NOW THAT ALLOW FOR UNETHICAL. PRACTICES THE OF THOSE ARE OVERSEEN BY DCHS RIGHT NOW. THERE THERE ARE. A PROVISIONS THAT REGULATE. PROVIDERS I THINK THAT. PROVIDING A PATIENTS BILL OF RIGHTS THOUGH ADDS TO ACCOUNTABILITY. RIGHT BUT I THINK THE OTHER CONCERN IS THAT THAT ALSO KIND OF LEADS TO- WHAT COULD BE A PROLIFERATION OF LAWSUITS SAYING HEY YOU HAVEN'T YOU KNOW MATT. YOU KNOW WHAT THE PERSON BELIEVES IS THEIR THEIR BILL OF RIGHTS- AND I AM CONCERNED ALSO BY THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THIS IN HERE THAT I THINK COULD ENCOURAGE THAT AND CERTAINLY- WE WANT TO DEAL WITH BAD ACTORS. AND UNETHICAL PRACTICES BUT WHAT I DON'T WANT TO DO IS UNDERMINE. ACCESS AND AVAILABILITY OF DRUG TREATMENT BECAUSE THIS IS A HUGE ISSUE ACROSS THE BOARD AND IF. AND IF I GET TO A PLACE WHERE. E&amp;OE SOME OF THESE DRUG TREATMENT CENTERS ARE CLOSING DOWN WHAT ARE NOT EXPANDING INTO RURAL AREAS OR OTHER AREAS THAT ARE UNDERSERVED AS A RESULT OF THE CONCERNED ABOUT LAWSUITS LIABILITY- THAT COULD BE PROBLEMATIC AND YOU HAVE. ANY THOUGHTS THAT MAYBE MANY RESPONSE TO THAT TRAVIS- I THINK THAT'S OF- UNDERSTANDABLE CONCERN IN TERMS OF THE FINDS THE THAT THE FINES ARE NOT- THEY'RE NOT OPPOSED AND PRIVATE TERRY GENERAL ACTION- THERE'S NOTHING THAT. BASICALLY SKILLS IS BACK SO UNDER CURRENT LAW IF YOU'RE A PROVIDER AND YOU DON'T FOR EXAMPLE PROVIDE TREATMENT- AND- THAT THAT CAUSES HARM THE SAME STANDARD WOULD APPLY IT DOESN'T IT IN OTHER WORDS IT DOESN'T ROLL BACK WHAT YOUR CURRENT RIGHTS ARE JUST SIMPLY- IT JUST SIMPLY PROVIDES A BILL OF RIGHTS TO PATIENTS SO THAT THEY KNOW WHAT WHAT CAN BE EXPECTED. YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT THAT MARKETING MATERIALS- HAVE SOME DEFICIENCIES OF NOT SURE WHAT THE WHAT THE DAMAGE WOULD BE I DON'T I DON'T THINK THIS IS GOING TO INCREASE LAWSUITS AT ALL- I SHARE YOUR CONCERN ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT. THERE IS AVAILABILITY- THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WAS RURAL AREAS OR OTHERS I SURE THAT CONCERN. OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTIONS COMMON THING THAT SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR IN YOUR STAFF- THIS IS THE FINAL BILL OF ON BURKE PELLUCID THIS MORNING AND- ORIGINAL VOTE.

THANK YOU SENATOR AMBER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WILL KNOW THAT OUR ITEM NUMBER FIVE SB THREE SIXTY ONE HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM OUR AGENDA. AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT SO THAT MOVES US NOW TO ITEM NUMBER SIX. SB FIVE NINETY EIGHT SENATOR PAM. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING. CHAIR MEMBERS. SB FIVE NINETY EIGHT IS A DISTRICT BILL WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATIONS THAT SACRAMENTO REGIONAL TRANSIT DISTRICT TO MOVE UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE CHARGES TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE PUBLIC EMPLOYEE RELATIONS BOARD OR PURPOSE. CURRENTLY THE DISTRICT AND SIMPLY ORGANIZATIONS MUST GO THROUGH THE OVER BURDENED AND UNDER RESOURCE SUPERIOR COURT SYSTEM FOR CONFLICT RESOLUTION. THIS EXISTING PROCESS IS TIME CONSUMING EXPENSIVE. AND MAY PLACE AN UNFAIR PRACTICE CHARGE OF THE JUDGE WHO MAY HAVE LITTLE EXPERIENCE WITH PUBLIC EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONS. MANY COURTS HAVE SEEN THEIR BACKLOGS GROWS RESULTED CALLED THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC IN COMPARISON THE PERFECT CONFLICT RESOLUTION PROCESS MORE STREAMLINED THE LESS EXPENSIVE. FOR EMPLOYERS AGENTS AND TAXPAYERS AND SPECIFIC TO THE CONFLICT RESOLUTION WITHIN PUBLIC SECTORS. AND THEN IT'S TAKEN IN THIS COMMITTEE ALLOWS PER TO FLY EXISTING PRECEDENT TO SECULAR REGIONAL TRANSIT WHILE DRAFTING DISTRICT SPECIFIC REGULATIONS THIS BILL IS SUPPORTED BY BOTH THE- SECOND REASON TRANSIT THE EMPLOYER AND THE- EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATIONS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK SENATOR I DO HAVE TWO WITNESSES LISTED DAVID PHILLIPS AND TIM CRIMMINS BOTH. WITH US ON THE TELEPHONE DAVID PHILLIPS ARE YOU WITH US.

QUICKLY TALK ABOUT SOME HISTORY- AND HOW WE GOT HERE THAT'S RIGHT MISTER CHAIR SO MY BOTTOM LINE ON THIS BILLS THIS IF WE COULD DO MORE. WE WOULD AYE WE RAN A BILL IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THAT WOULD HAVE ADDRESSED SOME OF THE LARGER CONCERNS THAT HAVE HEARD FROM SOME MEMBERS- ABOUT DATA COLLECTION AT THIS BILL THOUGH THAT WE ADVANCE IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. DIDN'T PASS THE LEGISLATURE. THE DIDN'T WE CAME BACK AT THIS IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE TRIED AGAIN WITH A DIFFERENT VERSION OF THE BILL. ONCE AGAIN. DIDN'T PASS. I'M WE'RE BACK HERE IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY. AFTER HITTING A PAUSE BUTTON FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS ON THIS ISSUE. THAT WE TOLD THE LEAGUE OF CITIES AND WE TOLD. LARA JEAN WHO WERE. WHO WE WERE WORKING WITH I WHO WERE THEN GOING TO WORK. ON A STATE WIDE BED TAX COLLECTIONS COLLECTION SYSTEM SOLUTION IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. WE TOLD THEM THAT WE WOULD GIVE THEM SPACE. SO NOW FAST FORWARD HERE TO JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. FIVE YEARS LATER WE'RE BACK IN FRONT OF YOU. I'M IN WERE BACK IN FRONT F YOU BECAUSE- RURAL COMMUNITIES DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN THIS STATE. ARE STILL AREN'T ABLE TO COLLECT THE BED TAX THAT THEIR OWN. FIVE YEARS LATER OUT OF THE FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY ONE CITIES IN FIFTY FOUR COUNTIES AT LEVY OF THE TAX. PROXIMALLY EIGHTY VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN SIGNED. AND TO TOP ALL OF THIS OFF. IN BETWEEN THIS POLITICAL FIGHT. RURAL CITIES AND COUNTIES STILL AREN'T ABLE TO SEE THE BED TAX IT THEY DESERVE. I'LL BE CANDID. I DON'T LIKE BEING ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF UNITE HERE. LOCAL CITIES AND WITH A LARGE- BUT THE TRUTH IS THIS. WE'VE ALL BEEN HERE IN OUR CAREER IN THE LEGISLATURE. RATHER THAN LOOKING AT A WHOLESALE CHANGE THAT WE HAVE. I SINCERELY TRIED TO DO. BUT THERE ARE TIMES IN THE LEGISLATURE WHERE WE NEED TO MOVE AN ISSUE FOR WORK. ON A STEP BY STEP. AT BASIS. WE NEED TO MAKE PROGRESS. AND THAT'S WHAT FIVE FIVE FIVE DOES. IT MAKES IMPORTANT PROGRESS DOES IT SOLVE THE ISSUE. CANDIDLY NOW. BUT WE'VE TRIED TO DO THAT WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK THIS ISSUE. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT COMPENSATE CITIES AND COUNTIES. WITH THE REVENUE THAT THEY ARE- AND THAT'S ONLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AT THIS PROGRAM. IS 1100% VOLUNTARY. A LOCAL AGENCIES WE NEED TO AN ACTING ORDINANCE TO PARTICIPATE. IN THIS PROGRAM. THIS BILL DOES NOT IMPACT VOLUNTARY COLLECTION AGREEMENTS WITH PLATFORMS. THOSE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS ARE GRANDFATHERED IN ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. SB FIVE FIVE FIVE GIVES JURISDICTIONS WHO HAVE NOT FOUND SUCCESS IN ENTERING INTO ONE OF THESE VC AZ'S VOLUNTARY. COLLECTION AGREEMENTS WITH HOSTING PLATFORMS THE ABILITY TO COLLECT THE VITAL UNTAPPED REVENUE THAT THEY DESERVE- AND AGAIN THERE ARE A FEW HUNDRED CITIES IN THE STATE. THAT WANT TO DO THIS BUT CAN'T BECAUSE WE CAN'T STRIKE THAT B. C. A. AT FIVE FIVE FIVE WILL PROVIDE CITIES AND COUNTIES. THAT WITH THE ABILITY TO ACCESS THIS ONLY IF THEY CHOOSE TO DO SO. FURTHER IT'S GOING TO ENSURE THAT ALL HOSTING PLATFORMS DO THEIR PART. NOT ALL HOSTING PLATFORMS ARE TREATING THE BED TAX COLLECTION PIECE EQUALLY IN THIS IS WHAT THIS WOULD ADVANCE ON A STATEWIDE. LEVEL AND FINALLY TODAY AT HONORED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A COUPLE FOLKS WHO WILL BE SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL.

OUR HERE SEASON ASSOCIATION OF THIRTY SEVEN RURAL CALIFORNIA COUNTIES MANY OF WHICH ARE PARTICULARLY DEPENDENT ON TOURISM AND HAVE ESTABLISHED TRANSIT OCCUPANCY TAXES AS A KEY COMPONENT OF THEIR COUNTIES REVENUE STREAM. AMONG OTHER THINGS IT- THESE TAXES HELP DEFRAY THE COST OF PROVIDING SERVICES TO THOSE WHO TEMPORARILY RESIDE IN THE LOCALITY INCLUDING LAW ENFORCEMENT ROAD IMPROVEMENTS- AND EMERGENCY. HEALTH CARE- RURAL COUNTIES HAVE BEEN CHALLENGED- IN ADDRESSING THAT DISPARATE TREATMENT OF SHORT TERM RENTALS- IN TERMS OF COLLECTING THAT TRANSIT OCCUPANCY TAX. AND IN STRONG SUPPORTER OF STRENGTHENING THE LAWN TO ENSURE T. OF C. COLLECTION AND COMPLIANCE BY THESE ONLINE SHORT TERM RENTAL FACILITATORS- PARTICULARLY AS TOURISM BEGINS TO OPEN BACK UP IN OUR COUNTIES.

GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS YOUR POLLS ARE PERMITTED IN BEACH I AM CALLING IN SUPPORT OF SB FIVE FIVE FIVE THANK YOU. AND AT THIS TIME THERE ARE NO FURTHER LINE'S QUEUED UP FOR SUPPORT. THANK YOU OPERATOR AND WE WILL THEN MOVE TO OPPOSITION I HAVE ONE OPPOSITION LISTED. JOHN CALDWELL. MISTER MCKINNEY HEARING YES GO AHEAD PLEASE. MISTER CHAIRMAN- THE- PRIMARY WITNESSES NICK ROMO FROM LEAD CALIFORNIA'S CITIES HE WAS UNABLE TO GET ON THE WITNESS LIST AND I'D ASK THAT YOU PLEASE ALLOW HIM TO MAKE HIS COMMENTS AT THE PUBLIC ACCESS TIME- DO I JOHN CALDWELL- WELL THAT CALIFORNIA HOTEL LODGING ASSOCIATION. FIRST LET ME SAY THAT SENATOR MCGUIRE IS A GREAT FRIEND OF THE LODGING INDUSTRY- OPPOSING THIS AUTHOR IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR US NEVERTHELESS WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL. HERE'S HOW TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAXES ARE COLLECTED FROM HOTELS AND B. AND B.'S EACH HOTEL MUST FILE QUARTERLY HOTEL ROOM TAX RETURNS UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY. EACH CITY CAN AUDIT ANY HOTEL ANY TIME GOING BACK UP TO THREE YEARS BUT UNDER THIS BILL SHORT TERM RENTALS IN THE CITY WOULD NOT HAVE TO SUBMIT ANYTHING TO THE CITY INSTEAD PLATFORMS LIKE AIRBNB WOULD PAY THE T. O. T. FOR THEIR HOST TO THE CD TFA. ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS REQUESTED BY THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES WHICH WE SUPPORTED SIMPLY CLARIFIED THAT THE PLATFORMS SHOULD PROVIDE TO THE CD TFA QUOTE INFORMATION NEEDED TO VALIDATE THE LOCATION. OF EACH SHORT TERM RENTAL FROM WHICH LOCAL CHARGES WERE COLLECTED AND- DECORATION PERIOD OF EACH SHORT TERM RENTAL BOOKING. THE NIGHTLY RATE FOR EACH SHORT TERM RENTAL BOOKING FUND QUOTE. THOSE COMMONSENSE AMENDMENTS WERE REJECTED PRESUMABLY BY THE PLATFORMS. WITHOUT THAT INFORMATION IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW THE TAX AGENCY CAN ADEQUATELY AUDIT THESE TAX RETURNS. BELIEVES PROPOSED AMENDMENTS ALSO ASKED THAT THE CITIES AND COUNTIES HAVE ACCESS TO THIS NEEDED INFORMATION THAT AMENDMENT WAS ALSO REJECTED. SO THE CITIES WILL NEVER KNOW WHICH SHORT TERM RENTALS PAID THE TO YOUR TEAM WHICH ONCE DID NOT. AS TO THE ARGUMENT THAT THIS IS BETTER THAN THE EXISTING SITUATION AND WE'RE CONCERNED THAT PASSAGE OF THIS BILL WILL ALLOW THE PLATFORMS TO CLAIM. THAT THE PROBLEM OF SHORT TERM RENTALS NOT BEING THE DOT HAS BEEN SOLVED WHEN IN FACT A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER. OF SHORT TERM RENTALS WILL STILL BE ABLE TO AVOID PAYING THE DOT. ITALY'S AMENDMENTS ARE TAKEN CHLA WILL SUPPORT THE BILL. IF NOT WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NOBLE. I THANK YOU. WE WILL NOW MOVE TO OTHERS IN OPPOSITION IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN THE CHAMBERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF SB FIVE FIVE FIVE. C. NOT HAVE A THERMO TESTIMONY STATION. SEEING NOT I PRETTY WOULD YOU OPEN THE LINES FOR THOSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF SB FIVE FIVE FIVE. WE DO HAVE LINE ONE OF FOUR IN Q. I MEDICARE MEMBERS NICK GROH WITH THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES IF I MAY HAVE A COUPLE MORE SECONDS. I'D LIKE. TO THAT'S OKAY I LIKE THAT THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF AND LAWS THAT SENATE MCGUIRE FOR THE YEAR HE SPENT ON THIS ISSUE ALL ACTOR ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE SENATOR THAT NOW WE CERTAINLY ARE AT IMPACT ON THIS ISSUE- BUT WE STILL BELIEVE IT'S AN APPROPRIATE THE LEGISLATURE TO SHIELD THE SHORT TERM RENTAL PLATFORMS FROM HAVING PROVIDE THE INFORMATION THAT THE CITY'S THE TAX DEPARTMENT- ALL TAX PROFESSIONALS COLLECT FROM BUSINESSES ACROSS THE STATE REGARDLESS. OF THEIR INDUSTRY SO ARE WE STILL LOOKING FOR THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE SPELLED OUT THAT WAS SPELLED OUT BY THE HOTEL LODGING ASSOCIATION I'M HOPING TO HAVE SOME ACCOMMODATION WITH THE DOCTOR AND SEE WHAT WE CAN TELL JUST BY I APPRECIATE YOU APPRECIATE. HOW CAN ACQUIRE THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. OTHER THAN WE DO HAVE LINE ONE TWENTY EIGHT. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOOD MORNING SHANE GUSMAN ON BEHALF OF UNITED HERE A POST THANK YOU. AND AT THIS TIME THERE ARE NO FURTHER LINE SECURED UP. THANK YOU OPERATOR YOU MAY CLOSE THE LINES I'M GOING TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU SENATOR AND THANK YOU FOR TALKING TO ME OVER THE WEEKEND I AM ACTUALLY VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT WE CANNOT BREAK THROUGH. AND GET INFORMATION. ON SHORT TERM RENTALS TO THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT TOT IT IS ABOUT NEIGHBORHOODS AND IS ABOUT MANAGING SHORT TERM RENTALS. IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE PEOPLE LIVE AND SO YES THE JURISDICTIONS NEED THAT INFORMATION AND YOU'VE BUILT IN SOME AUDIT PROVISIONS. SO THAT THE- WE CAN HAVE SOME CONFIDENCE THAT. THE CORRECT AMOUNT OF TOT IS BEING COLLECTED BUT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO KNOW THE EXACT LOCATIONS THAT MAKES IT MUCH HARDER FOR LOCAL JURISDCTIONS TO ENACT SOME OF THE PROVISIONS THAT THEY HAVE UP AND DOWN. IN THE AREAS WHERE IN MY INSTANCE FOR EXAMPLE DOWN THE COAST BUT IN OTHER AREAS WHERE THERE'S HIGH TOURIST TRAFFIC IN AND OUT AND AHIGH DESIRE TO. TAKE HOMES AND TURNED THEM INTO SHORT TERM RENTALS WHICH DOES MULTIPLE THINGS INCLUDING TAKING HOUSING OFF OF THE MARKET IN IN AREAS WHERE IT'S DESPERATELY NEEDED. I THINK THIS BILL IS WORTHY OF MOVING FORWARD JUST BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME JURISDICTIONS THAT WILL NOT DON'T HAVE THE CLOUT OF SOME OF THE OTHERS TO BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE THESE VOLUNTARY COLLECTION AGREEMENTS. THIS WILL ENSURE AT LEAST THE TOT IS MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION BUT I THINK WE CANNOT. OVERLOOK THE FACT THAT THE INFORMATION THAT IS SOUGHT BY THE CITIES AND THE COUNTIES ABOUT WHERE THIS. DECATUR RENTALS ARE LOCATED. IS VERY KEY NOT JUST IN THE COLLECTION OF TOT BUT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF. THE ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE HAD WITH WITH SHORT TERM RENTALS TO FREE TO STEP FORWARD BUT IT IS A BIT LACKING I ACTUALLY KNOW YOU AGREE WITH ME ON THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. SO I APPRECIATE THAT BUT I WANTED TO FRAME THAT FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. BUT WITH SOME CONCERNS THAT I THINK WE NEED TO BE COGNIZANT- RIGHT TWELVE- THIS GONZALEZ AND THEN MISTER TO IN THE MISTER GALLAGHER. AND I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS BILL MOVING FOR TODAY BUT I HAVE TO SAY I'M REALLY DISAPPOINTED- IN PARTICULAR WITH MY MEETING WITH AIRBNB I STILL I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW WE ARE ALLOWING A COMPANY TO HELP. IT'S I GUESS YOU COULD SAY CLIENTS AVOID LOCAL LAWS I MEAN THAT'S THE ONLY AYE AYE. A HEARD NOTHING I DON'T KNOW IF ANY YEAR WITNESSES CAN EXPLAIN. WHY THEY WON'T ACCEPT THIS AMENDMENT WHICH TO ME IS VITAL TO THE PROPER COLLECTION OF TOT SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE SOMEBODY IT WAS IT WAS QUITE- SHOCKING. THE ANSWERS WERE PATHETIC I MEAN THEY THE RESPONSES BY AT LEAST THAT COMPANY- AND I DON'T KNOW WHY WE AS A LEGISLATURE CONTINUED ALLOWED A PLATFORM TO WORK IN A WAY THAT THEY ARE. OBVIOUSLY SHIELDING- THEY THEY'RE THEY'RE HELPING PERPETRATE THE RENTAL OF THESE IN SOMETIMES THE ILLEGAL RENTAL OF HOMES WITHOUT PROVIDING THE DATA NECESSARY FOR CITY TO FOLLOW UP ON ITSELF I DON'T KNOW IF YOUR WITNESSES ARE- FOUR TO THAT AMENDMENT CAN SPEAK TO IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- IF IT'S ALRIGHT WITH THE SIMMERING TO THROUGH THE CHAIR JUST TO RESPOND ABOUT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT THE CHAMBER OR RC RC WE ARE SPEAK TO THOSE ARE TO ME WITNESSES BUT HERE'S WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT. I HEAR YOUR FRUSTRATION I HEAR THE CHEERS FRUSTRATION. AND THATPREVIOUS BILL THAT WE HAD WOULD DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO BOTH ASSEMBLY WOMAN AT GONZALEZ AS WELL AS CHAIR STONE- IN SO. JUST BEING CANDID AND TRANSPARENT- WE WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO GO FURTHER WE'VE TRIED WE TRIED TWICE ON AND- IT DIDN'T WORK COULDN'T GET IT PASSED SO I'M GONNA HARKEN BACK TO SENATOR MARK LENO. SEVEN YEARS SENATOR MARK LENO TRIED TO BE ABLE TO- GET- THE CARCINOGEN WITHIN FLAME RETARDANT IN FURNITURE- BAND. THEY TOOK SEVEN YEARS TO BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH THIS LEGISLATURE- THIS IS ALMOST ON THE SAME TRAJECTORY- AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE. TO FIGHT AND- PUSH FORWARD- AND I'M SURE YOU'RE GONNA SEE IS BACK HERE- IN THE COMING MONTHS AND BECAUSE- AT THE MOMENT I I'M NOT GONNA. ARGUE WITH YOU I THINK WERE VERY MUCH IN THE SIMILAR SIZE. THANK YOU VISIT TO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK- I WILL ALSO SHARE IN OUR COLLEAGUES- AND I THINK YOUR PERSPECTIVE THAT- THIS IS A COMPLICATED AREA AND THERE'S MORE THAT WE WISH WE COULD DO- AND I APPRECIATE TO FOR MANY YEARS I THINK OUR VERY FIRST MEETING YEARS AGO WE WERE DISCUSSING THIS VERY ISSUE- SO I WANTED TO STATE A FEW THINGS ABOUT WHAT I THINK THIS BILL IS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT I UNDERSTAND IS CORRECT AND I NEED A QUESTION WHICH IS. MY UNDERSTANDING IS YOUR BILL ESTABLISHES AN OPTIONAL AND VOLUNTARY STRUCTURE ONLY FOR THOSE JURISDICTIONS THAT CHOOSE TO DO SO THAT OTHERWISE WOULD BE ABLE TO COLLECT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IT'S NOT MANDATORY SO ANY JURISDICTION THAT WISHES TO ENACT THEIR OWN ORDINANCE OR DO SOMETHING ELSE CAN DO SO. THAT ANY CITY CAN ADJUSTED TAX RATE OR EXIT THE PROGRAM AT THE TIME- THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING WHERE THE BILL IS THAT CORRECT SEPTEMBER YOU'RE A 100% CORRECT THAT NUMBER ONE THIS IS 1100% OPTIONAL NUMBER TWO CITIES HAVE TO OPT IN NUMBER THREE THERE'S A PROCESS IN WHICH CITIES IF THEY WANT TO REMOVE THEMSELVES CAN DO SO- WITHIN A SPECIFIC TIME PERIOD. ANOTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS- AS WE DISCUSSED- I AUTHORED THE LOCAL ORDINANCE IN SAN FRANCISCO- NOW SEVEN YEARS AGO WITH THAT ESTABLISHED THE FIRST REGULATORY REGIME. OF HOME SHARING IN THE STATE. TODAY IT'S VIEWED AS THE STRONGEST REGULATORY STRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA. WITH THE STRONGEST DATA COLLECTION REQUIREMENTS IN THE STATE. JUST ONE MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL. THAT UNDERMINES OUR LOCAL REGULATORY STRUCTURE. AND SAN FRANCISCO OR ANY OTHER CITY. THAT HAS ENFORCEABLE AGREEMENTS- WITH THE HOME SHARING COMPANY IS THAT RIGHT. IT'S A GREAT QUESTION YOU ARE A 100% CORRECT NUMBER ONE. THIS BILL GRANDFATHERS IN. ALL VOLUNTARY COUNTRY BACK COLLECTION AGREEMENTS- IN EACH OF THE CITIES AND COUNTIES WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED. NUMBER TWO. I HEARD THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION- THIS LEGISLATURE CAN'T IMPOSE. ADDITIONAL ITEMS ON TO THOSE ALREADY ESTABLISHED CONTRACTS BETWEEN THE MUNICIPALITY IN A THIRD PARTY VENDOR. THREE THAT MEANS. THAT THE PLATFORM IN THE CITY. ARE BOUND BY THE CONTRACT THE DAY OF AGREED UPON. MEANING THAT PLATFORMS CAN. EXIT OR CITIES CAN EXIT. ACCORDING TO THE CONTRACT THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN ESTABLISHED FURTHER LOCAL LAW- IN THIS. BILL DOES NOT ALTER THAT FACT. IF THE CITY HAS. A VOLUNTARY- VCA IN PLACE. IT STAYS IN PLACE. GRANDFATHERED IN THE LAST PIECE I'LL SAY- AS WE SEEN IN. THE LETTER FROM AIRBNB AND I'LL JUST READ FROM IT. IF THIS BILL WERE TO PASS. THAT WE WOULD NOT PULL OUT OF OUR EXISTING VC ACE. WE TAKE OUR COMMITMENT TO PARTNER WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY SERIOUSLY. AND WOULD NOT ENDANGER OUR EXISTING VCA AGREEMENTS WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND THAT WAS FROM AIRBNB IS. LETTER AT THAT POINT YOU'RE COMMITTING TO THE LEGISLATURE. THANK YOU WELL- I APPRECIATE ALL YOUR WORK ON THIS AND WITH THOSE UNDERSTANDINGS. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY I KNOW- ANTICIPATE THIS PROBABLY NOT THE LAST CONVERSATION ON THIS TOPIC BUT- APPRECIATE ALL YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS AND- WITH THAT'LL TURN BACK TO THE CHURCH. IN A RESEARCH IS GOVERNOR. THANK YOU SENATOR- AND- FIRST OF ALL I DO APPRECIATE I THINK THIS APPROACH IN TERMS OF MAKING THIS SORT OF AN OPT IN SYSTEM THAT YOU KNOW FOR. YOU KNOW WHERE LOCALS DETERMINE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THEY WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AND UTILIZE- YOU KNOW CD TFA- TO COLLECT- COLLECT THE TAXES AND PROVIDE THAT THAT YOU KNOW WHERE IT MAKES SENSE FOR THEM THEY CAN THEY CAN UTILIZE THAT I THINK THAT IS A GOOD APPROACH. ONE I GUESS TO CONCERNS THAT I HAVE- ONE. YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY EASY WITH YOUR REGULAR HOTEL MOTEL. AND A LOT OF OUR YOU KNOW RURAL AREAS YOU KNOW THAT WE REPRESENT. WE KNOW FOR SURE THAT DAY- YOU ARE GIVING US THE T. O. T. THAT WE- THAT THEY OWE TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY- AND I THINK THE CONCERN HERE AND I SHARE THAT WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ IS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY. YOU KNOW THOSE WHO ARE DOING SHORT TERM RENTALS CAN'T PROVIDE THE SAME DATA. YOU KNOW THE SAME WAY AND SO THAT CAN BE VERIFIED RIGHT I MEAN IT. SO I MEAN IS THERE A WAY THAT WE CAN ADOPT HER MAKING A MEMO HERE THAT REQUIRES THEM. TO PROVIDE VERIFIABLE. DATA SO THAT YOU KNOW IF SOMEBODY IS OPTING FOR THIS- THAT THEY CAN THEN GO AN AUDIT AND ENSURE. THAT THEY'RE GETTING THE T. O. T. AT THE ROAD BECAUSE I JUST WANT EVERYBODY TO BE TREATED THE SAME WAY RIGHT I MEAN THE- YOU KNOW THE- THIS THE SMALL HOTEL OWNER MOTEL OWNER THE IN THE A THOSE WHO USUALLY USING AIRBNB. WHOEVER BE TO DO SHORTER RENTALS THEY SHOULD ALL BE PAYING THE SAME TAX- TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. SO THE I MEAN IS THERE. I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG CONCERN IS HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT STE THAT THAT CAN BE ENFORCEABLE AGAINST THESE SHORT TERM RENTALS NO THANK YOU SO MUCH AS A VICE CHAIR- SUGGEST. AGAIN WILL ALWAYS BE CANDID AND- IN PLEASE MISTER CHAIR PLEASE. CLICK BACK TO ME IF YOU THINK I. DID NOT PHRASE OUR CONVERSATION- CORRECTLY WHEN I'M ABOUT TO SAY. I IT THIS IS A CONVERSATION THAT YOU'RE AND I TALKED ABOUT OVER A THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT THAT YOU'RE AND I TALKED ABOUT OVER THE WEEKEND. I THINK THE- THE BOTTOM LINE OF THIS BILL IS THIS. WE'VE ATTEMPTED IT. I YOU'RE GONNA SEE ME BACK I'M SURE IN FRONT OF YOU IN THE COMING YEARS ON THIS VERY SPECIFIC ISSUE- I DO NOT THINK AT THIS TIME. WE WOULD BE ABLE TO GET A BILL WITH THAT WITH THOSE PROVISIONS THROUGH. BASED SOLELY OFF OF POLITICS- AND WHERE WE NEED TO MOVE IS ON A STEP BY STEP BASIS TO MAKE PROGRESS. SO RIGHT NOW THERE ARE LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ESPECIALLY IN RURAL COUNTIES AND COMMUNITIES. I THEY'RE BEING LEFT ON THE TABLE. THIS MAKES PROGRESS IN THAT IN THE OTHER ISSUE IS IT CREATES PARITY SO RIGHT NOW YOU LITERALLY HAVE THOUSANDS OF HOMES THAT ARE NOT PAYING THE TAX THAT JURISDICTION'S ARE RIGHTFULLY DO. WHICH MEANS THIS BILL WILL PUT THOSE VACATION RENTALS ON THE SAME- RUNWAY AS SMALL HOTELS AS WELL IN OUR JURISDICTIONS SO ON THEY HAVE TO PAY THE SAME TAX RATE AS THOSE HOTELS AND- MISTER VICE YEAR I'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU. OUT HERE IN THE FUTURE ON A BILL THAT WOULD DO WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT- HERE IN THE A AND I TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO RIGHT IF YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE A FURTHER CONVERSATION A SAUCY THINKING VICE CHAIR WE WORKED ON. SEVERAL ISSUES IN REGARDS TO RESOURCES A WILDFIRE AND BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON THIS. AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU SENATOR IN THEM ONE OTHER ISSUE THAT CAME UP- IS AND GUESTS COME FROM LIKE GROUPS LIKE BOOKING DOT COM WHERE THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY THE- YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT TAKING THE PAYMENT. THEY DON'T ACCEPT PAYMENT FROM THE PURCHASER- YOU KNOW COULD THEY BE CONSIDERED YOU KNOW TAKEN OU OF THE DEFINITION OF A SHORT TERM RENTAL FACILITATOR THAT'S SOMETHING YOU'VE BEEN-TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE I COULD SEE THAT ARGUMENT WHERE THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY THE ONE THAT'S RENTING THE- THE OFFICIALLY OUT TAKING PET- PAYMENT FROM CONSUMERS SO SHOULD THEY BE REALLY THE ONES REPORTING THIS DATA. YOU REALLY SHOULD BE THE PERSON THAT IS ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR DOING THAT. YES SO. THE WAY BOOKING WORKS IS THEY HAVE A THIRD PARTY VENDOR THAT ACTUALLY COLLECTS SO- THERE IS A VENDOR THAT TAKES THE PAYMENT- AND BOOKING IS CORRECT THAT THEY DON'T SEE THAT TRANSACTION THROUGH THEIR SYSTEM HERE IN THE UNITED STATES AT THIS TIME. NOW THERE IS LITIGATION PENDING IN ITALY. WITH BOOKING DOT COM- AND- TO ENSURE THAT THEY PAY. THEIR TAXES- IN THERE IS A AND THEN. THAT I BELIEVE COULD. WHERE WE WERE HAVE THIRD VENN. FOR BOOK. COLLECT THE TAX. ARE AT TIME OF PAIN. I DO WANT TO SPEAK FOR A THIS TIME BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE OT ON THAT AN INMATE- BUT- YES IT COULD BE DONE- AND IT WOULD CREATE PARITY AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE TALKED ABOUT- YOU KNOW ONCE A THANK YOU TO CHAIRMAN BURKE. IN REDDING TAX ABOUT THAT POTENTIAL IMPACT. YEAH THAT'LL HAVE ISSUE DAVID. A QUESTION IN REGARDS TO THE AUDIT HOW OFTEN CAN A CITY- REQUEST AN AUDIT. I BELIEVE EIGHT QUARTERLY BUT I DON'T HAVE THAT IN FRONT OF ME BUT I BELIEVE ITS QUARTERLY AT FROM THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT TEXAN TEAM MINISTRATION X. I. I BELIEVE THAT'S- THAT'S WHEN THEY COLLECTED EVERY QUARTER AS WELL CORRECT. YES MA'AM RIGHT- YOU KNOW LEXUS I UNDERSTAND LEAGUE CITY AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN VERY STRONG WITH LOCAL CONTROL AND THE FACT THAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE THAT YOU CAN OPT INTO THIS PROGRAM IS NOT MANDATORY- IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. AND SO YOU KNOW IF WE KEEP THAT- I CAN SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU MA'AM N. F. SAN ROMAN I PROMISE YOU THAT THIS IS GONNA REMAIN. VOLUNTARY AND IT WOULD HAVE TO BE AN OFTEN BASED OFF OF LOCAL ORDINANCE- IN I WANNA GET BACK TO YOU IN REGARDS TO THE AUDIT. WE DON'T SPECIFY THE TIMELINE- IN REGARDS TO IF IT'S AUDIT OR- ON A ANNUAL BASIS SAID THERE IS NO LIMITATION. IN REGARDS TO WIN A CITY- WOULD BE ABLE TO REQUEST AN AUDIT SO I WANTED TO CORRECT THAT FOR THE RECORD TRADE TO MAKE SURE I ANSWER- SPECIFICALLY FOR YOU. GREATLY APPRECIATED THINKING THANK YOU SONORA. THANK YOU ISRAEL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. SENATOR I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION WE'VE HAD REGARDING THIS IT'S CLEAR THAT WE NEED TO COLLECT THIS. I WOULD BE THE DATA. THE DATA IS NECESSARY IN ORDER FOR PROPER COLLECTION AND AUDITING. AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU GAVE THE HISTORY OF THIS SO THAT WE KNOW THAT THIS ISN'T YOUR FIRST TRY. TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING. IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE YOU'RE COMMITTED TO TRY TO FIND THE BEST WAY. AND I AGREE WITH THE CHAIRMAN AND I APPRECIATE HIS COMMENTS ABOUT THIS BEING AN IMPORTANT STEP- BUT I HOPE THAT YOU HEAR FROM ALL OF US. THAT WERE WITH YOU ON THIS AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE WITH THE OTHER ASPECTS OF IT THAT ARE GOING TO MAKE THIS AND EVEN SPEAKING. MAKE FUTURE LEGISLATION EVEN STRONGER TO DO EXACTLY WHAT IT IS WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND THAT'S THE PROPER COLLECTIONS THE PROPER COLLECTION DATA. SO THAT YOU CAN COLLECT THE ATTACKS CANDID. PAPARAZZI WITH THAT NO THANK YOU MANAGER LEADER NINETY WANNA SAY I IT IS HEARTENING I JUST CANDID THIS BEEN US LOG. IN POOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU- S. FELT THE LOCALLY WHEN HE WAS A PRESENT THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. THERE ARE VERY FEW ISSUES THAT HAVE CREATED SUCH CONTROVERSY INTENTION.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT- THAT I CAME ON TOO EARLY- THIS IS AGAIN MATTHEW HARPER THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS PROPERTIES ASSOCIATION- YOU SHOULD ALL BE IN RECEIPT OF A LETTER THAT WE SENT. OUT WE DON'T DISPUTE- THAT FROM THE KIDS CAN BE HELPFUL- IN EXTREME CASES- BUT WE DO AGREE WITH THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF LEGAL ISSUES AND THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES WITHIN THIS BILL- THAT. DON'T CONFORM WITH HOW CALIFORNIA HAVE CREATED- THIS AREA IT IN OTHER AREAS AS YOU HEARD THE TESTIMONY TODAY- THIS BILL IS SUPPOSEDLY- FOLLOWING THE STATE OF GEORGIA AND WHAT THEY'VE DONE IN THIS AREA THEY'VE BEEN THE ONLY STATE THAT HAS LEGISLATED IN THIS AREA. BUT THE STATE OF GEORGIA LAW THAT CITED. AIM ONLY TO PAY SCHOOL. IT ALSO PROVIDES PROPER MEDICAL TRAINING THIS BILL IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY REQUIRES PROPERTY MANAGERS TO PROVIDE SOME TRAINING PAMPHLET DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY PROPER TRAINING WHATSOEVER AND TO PUT THE TRAINING REQUIREMENTS ON PROPERTY MANAGERS- TO TRAIN IN COMPLICATED MEDICAL PROCEDURES I KNOW THE AUTHOR SAYS THIS IS SIMPLE BUT BELIEVE ME I'M I'M- I. DON'T THINK APPLYING A TOURNIQUET IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION THAT THE SIMPLE MEDICAL PROCEDURE IT'S NOT LIKE AN EASY WORDS FULL PROOF YOU CAN ACTUALLY HURT THE PATIENT APPLYING A TOURNIQUET- GEORGIA LAW ALSO PROVIDES FUNDING AND IT ALSO OVERSEEN BY STATE AGENCIES. THIS BILL IN FRONT OF YOU HAS NONE OF THAT IT ALSO HAS A LOT OF LIABILITY ISSUES THAT I THINK THAT THE COMEDIAN OUT THIS REALLY GOES INTO IN DETAIL. AND WILL PUT A LOT OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS. IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY'RE NOT COVERED BY LIABILITY PROTECTION UNDER THE BILL. SO WITH ALL OF THAT WE HOPE THAT THE AUTHOR WILL CONSIDER- MAKING SOME AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL CHANGING THE LIABILITY ISSUES. MAKING THAT THERE BE SOME ACTUAL TRAINING REQUIREMENTS ON THIS THAT ARE PUT ON FOLKS THAT ACTUALLY HAVE MEDICAL TRAINING YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING UNDER THE EIGHTY BUILT THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION THAT PROVIDES THE TRAINING IT'S NOT. PROPERTY MANAGERS. WE RESPECT. THE AUTHOR'S INTENT HERE BUT YOU HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS THE LACK OF TRAINING THE LACK OF FUNDING. THE FACT THAT IT'S A MANDATE ON ALL BUILDINGS ACROSS THE STATE AND NOT JUST FOCUS ON AND MANY OF THE BUILDINGS THAT WERE REFERENCED TODAY IN THIS TESTIMONY. AND IN FACT WE'VE HEARD TODAY THINGS LIKE MILITARY COMBAT DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE- THESE ARE ALL- AREAS WHERE THIS BILL IS NOW MANDATING THAT MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. HAVE ACCESS TO THESE THAT THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY FOR TRAINING THEM ARE PROPERTY MANAGERS WE DON'T THINK THAT THAT IS AN APPROPRIATE. RESPONSIBILITY FOR US SO WE URGE. YOU TO VOTE NO ON THIS AND OR GET SOME AGREEMENTS. TO AMEND THIS BILL IN A PROPER MANNER THANK. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITE. AND AFTER THERE ARE- VOICE IS NOT THE PLEASE PRAY ONE ZERO AT THIS. MISTER SHARE WE HAVE KNOWN QUEUING UP AT THIS TIME RIGHT THANK YOU OPERATOR YOU MAY CLOSE THE LINES OVER IN THE BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SEEING NONE SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M SORRY I'M SORRY TO HEAR THERE'S OPPOSITION TO AND I'M SORRY THAT THERE'S BEEN A HUGE DISTORTION. OF WHAT THE SEXUAL THIS BILL ACTUALLY REQUIRES BUT- THE VET BILL REQUIRES NONE OF THAT IT DOESN'T EVEN REQUIRE THAT PEOPLE USE THE KIDS IT DOESN'T EVEN HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE FOR NOT USING THE KIDS SO- SIMPLY PUT I MEAN THIS THIS WILL. PUT A TOOL IMPORTANT TOOL ON THE SHELF FOR SOMEBODY WILLING- TO USES TO SAVE A LIFE.

ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU MAY CLOSE THE LINES AND I WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MISS DAVIES. SENATOR. I JUST THANK YOU- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL TO US TODAY I'M I'M GOING TO SUPPORT IT BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE IT'S LONG OVERDUE FOR LEGISLATION PASSED FOR SOME TYPE OF PAGA REFORM HOWEVER I DO WANT TO COURAGE THAT ALL STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE EITHER OPPOSED OR SUPPORTING THIS THAT INDIVIDUAL CARVILLE'S ARE NOT THE ONLY ANSWER AND I THINK THAT WE WOULD MAKE SURE THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH OTHERS- SO I'M HERE TO HELP- I'M WILLING TO WORK WITH ANYONE NEXT YEAR TO SEE THAT THIS HAPPENS. AGAIN I WANNA THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL- GREATLY APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU SIR KERN. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. RIGHT SEEING NONE SENATOR THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK AS WE DID SPEND SOME TIME ON IT I AM A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED AND I'VE SPOKEN WITH. THEM SOME OF THE SPONSORS ON THIS THE PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACT IS A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT PROVIDES A REAL. ROAD FOR REMEDIES FOR EMPLOYEES WHO ARE MISTREATED AND I THINK WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED BY ANY SIGNIFICANT DILUTION FOR REMOVAL OF AN EMPLOYEE'S ABILITY. TO SEEK THOSE REMEDIES THAT THERE'S A LOT OF NEGATIVE MYTHOLOGY THAT'S BEEN BUILT UP AROUND PAGA EVEN THOUGH IT'S- NOT EVEN TWENTY YEARS OLD NOW. BUT THE LIMITATIONS BUILT INTO THAT LAW ARE STILL APPROPRIATE AND WE JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT PAGA STILL REPRESENTS AN APPROPRIATE BACKSTOPS. TO THE BENEFIT OF THOSE EMPLOYEES AND THAT WAS THE HEART OF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU DID AND WITH RESPECT TO THE STAFF WORK THAT YOU ADHERE TO PUT THAT BACKSTOP IN I THINK THE ISSUE IS HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH FOR A PERIOD OF TIME IS. TWO THINGS ONE THE UNIQUE NATURE OF THIS INDUSTRY AND HOW IT REALLY IS A RACE TO THE BOTTOM. AND THAT THERE IS A BASIS FOR THAT A RATIONAL BASIS IN THE SECOND OF COURSE IS THAT CERTAINLY- THE LABOR ORGANIZATION CAN PROTECT FOLKS UNDERLYING ARCHITECTURE JUST POTENTIAL ARCHITECTURE WHICH I HAVE OBSERVED IN. THE LABOR CODE IN WHAT WE DO IS THAT WE AS THE GOVERNMENT SAY WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT INDIVIDUAL WORKERS AT WHAT DATES BOY BACK TO THE INDUSTRIAL DAYS OF. CHILD PROTECTION ALIKE HOWEVER IF YOU HAVE A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT YOU KNOW HAVE DON'T HAVE THIS DISTRICT POWER BUT I AGREE WITH YOU THAT IT'S A SENSITIVE ISSUE AND I THINK THAT WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH RESPECT TO AMENDMENTS TO PUT THE NECESSARY BORDERS AROUND IT. AND TO ASK FOR RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU SENATOR I'M LOOKING FOR A- PROMOTION- NTN WE TALK ABOUT AMENDMENTS FOR YOUR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS ADVOWSONS AS OFFICE ABSOLUTELY ONES ARE SET FORTH IN THE- HOUSE YET. R.

THERE IS CHAIR AGAIN I WANT TO- EXPRESS I APOLOGIZE FOR YOUR STAFF I PUT HIM TO WORK ON ALL THESE TICKLISH ISSUES BUT I WANT TO THANK ALISON MERRILEES SUTTER CHIEF FOR HER TIRELESS EFFORTS IN TRYING TO DEAL WITH ALL OF THE VARIOUS BALANCING ACT THAT IT TOOK. TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE NOW. BOTTOM LINE IN THE REASON WHY DO WE BRING THIS AND WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT. CALIFORNIA HAS THE LARGEST- CIVIL RIGHTS AGENCY IN THE COUNTRY I STARTED IN NINETEEN FIFTY NINE BY WILLIAM BRADFORD AND GUS HAWKINS WHO AUTHORED THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES ACT. IN THE IN THE- THAT SIMPLEMENT AND HOUSING ACT THE FIAT- BACK IN THOSE DAYS WHICH MIRRORS WHAT WE DO WITH THE EEOC. AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU HAVE THE GOVERNMENT WHO IS STANDING ON BEHALF OF INDIVIDUALS TO PROTECT THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS IN ADDITION YOU HAVE THE INDIVIDUAL WHO OFTEN HIRES LAWYERS TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT RIGHTS WOULD HAVE BEEN A VIOLATION. THERE WAS A COURT CASE THAT CAME DOWN FROM THE- CERTIFIED FOR PUBLICATION ON THE FOURTH APPELLATE DISTRICT. ON APRIL EIGHTH AND THIS MEASURE HAS BEEN A PLATE OF TWENTY. ONE TWENTY AND THIS MEASURE IT'S CALLED THE- THE- WHICH WOULD VERSUS PARACORD SAN DIEGO COUNTY AND THE REASON I'M CARRYING THIS BILL IS PRECISELY AS A RESULT OF THE HOLDING IN THAT CASE. THE HOLDING IN THAT CASE IN SOME NARROW CONSTRAINTS LIKE TO SPECIFICS BUT BROADLY SPEAKING SAID. THAT THE AGENCY HAS NO ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE. ARM MOVES RELATED TO THE INDIVIDUAL AND SORT CREATED THIS THIS UNCERTAINTY WHERE THE AGENCIES TRYING TO PROTECT PEOPLE CIVIL RIGHTS THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO GET INFORMATION. AND HAVE THE INFORMATION IS GIVEN TO THEM IN THIS CASE IT WAS AN EMAIL. TO BE PROTECTED SO WITH THE HELP OF YOUR STAFF AND AT THE ADVOCATES- WE HAVE NARROWLY CRAFTED A SERIES OF AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY. WELL THE F. B. H. IS THE HOLDER OF THE PRIVILEGE. IT IS ASSERTED BY IF IT IS ASSERTED BY THE COMPLAINT ON THE DEPARTMENT'S BEHALF. BUT NOT NOT OVER THE OBJECTION OF THE DEPARTMENT AND FURTHER THE PRIVILEGE COULD NOT BE WAVE WITHOUT THE DEPARTMENT'S CONSENT- THE PURPOSE OF THAT AMENDMENT IS I THINK YOU WERE SHOOTING STAFF IS AWARE. SERVE TO CLARIFY THE PROCEDURE BY WHICH PRIVILEGE WILL BE ASSERTED. IT ALSO CLARIFIES THE SCOPE OF THE PRIVILEGE IN ORDER TO CREATE SOME GUIDELINES FOR WHAT IT IS A SORT OF IS A QUITE CHALLENGING ISSUE. IT'S GOT A LOT OF ATTENTION AS YOUR STAFF KNOWS FROM THE WORK THEY PUT INTO IT. WE JUST GOT A OPPOSITION LETTER LATE YESTERDAY WHICH WE HADN'T SEEN. AGAIN UNTIL YESTERDAY THAT SOME OF THE GROUPS THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH STILL HAVE SOME CONCERNS. HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM IN TERMS OF HOW TO FURTHER DEFINE THIS. ISSUE BUT WE'RE TRYING TO OVERTURN THE WITH YOUR HOLDING. IN WOOD VERSUS SUPERIOR COURT AND GIVE SOME AUTHORITY TO THE- DEPARTMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN APPROPRIATELY. ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF IN A CONFIDENTIAL MANNER- THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE- DIFFERENT FILING THEIR CASES ON BEHALF OF. SO WITH THAT WE HAVE- A WITNESS I BELIEVE HERE- IS RODNEY LIKE GET AN ATTORNEY AT THE HOUSING RIGHTS CENTER. AND ADAM ROMERO FROM DFG H. FOR TECHNICAL SUPPORT WHICH- THANK YOU CENTER YOU MENTION THE- AND TAKING THOSE IS OFFICE. THEM THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT WE WILL GO TO SUPPORT WITNESSES I HAVE RODNEY LEGATE.

HRC WORKS TO ENSURE EQUAL HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL PEOPLE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND ENGAGES IN EFFORTS TO END SEGREGATION HOUSING. FOR VIGOROUS ENFORCEMENT OF THE EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT THE END RESULT I TYPED IN OTHER FAIR HOUSING LAWS. HRC REGULARLY EDUCATE THE HOUSING LENDING AND INSURANCE INDUSTRY TO COMPLYWITH THE FAIR HOUSING I CAN PARTICIPATE THE PLAINTIFFS VERY SEX. DISCRIMINATION LITIGATION HOWEVER HRC HAVE UNLIMITED RESOURCES AND RELIES ON GOVERNMENT CIVIL RIGHTS AGENCIES SUCH AS THE AT THE AGE TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR PEOPLE HARMED BY HOUSING DISCRIMINATION.

WHEN I DISCRIMINATION VICTIM FILED WITH THE FTA THEY'RE OFTEN TIME HEARING CHORE. IN THE- SO AND- ACCORDINGLY COMPANIES. IS ESSENTIAL FOR VICTIMS OF DISCRIMINATION TO FREELY DISCUSS THEIR EXPERIENCES WITHOUT FEAR OF RETALIATION. HOWEVER RECENT COURT RULINGS HAVE CREATED A LOOPHOLE IN THE LAW DEPARTMENT ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE FROM FLYING TO CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN DEFENSE LAWYERS IN THE INDIVIDUALS IS A BRIGHT CLEAR AND SENDING. THE VICTIMS OF SO HAVE LOST THE RIGHT TO CONFIDENTIAL. WITH YOU AT THE AGE BECOMES WILL BE THE LAST LIKELY THE COMPLAINT IF YOU LESS LIKELY TO DISCUSS THE FACT OF THE CASE BILLION ALONG WITH THE S. C. H. AND THEREFORE LESS LIKELY TO RECEIVE THE RELEASE PORTION THEY ARE LEGALLY ENTITLED. ADDITIONALLY THE OFFICIAL BEGIN TO DISCOVER TO FILE COMPLAINT HAVE TO COMPLETE INVESTIGATING. SUFFERING IS FREE SERVICES ENSURE THAT VICTIMS OF DISCRIMINATION WITH LIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES STILL HAVE ACCESS TO JUSTICE. PROTECTING THE COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE LAWYERS AND VICTIMS OF DISCRIMINATION ASK CONFIDENTIAL WILL ALLOW THOSE WITH LIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO RECEIVE THE SAME ACCESS TO JUSTICE. OF THOSE WITH THE FINANCIAL MEANS LITIGATE THEIR CASES IN COURT. AS SEVEN SEVEN HELPS ENSURE THAT EVERY. HAS EAGER ACCESS JUSTICE AND THE FBI AGENT MANDATED TO PROVIDE. FOR THESE REASONS HRC SUPPORT SB SEVEN SEVEN FOUR IN ACTS THAT YOU SUPPORTED AS WELL THANK YOU.

I'VE BEEN PRACTICING LAW FOR TWENTY NINE YEARS AND HAVE LITIGATED NUMEROUS THE HIGH CASES INCLUDING HIGH PROFILE CASES AGAINST HARVEY WEINSTEIN AND OTHER CHANGE MAKING LITIGATION. OUR ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS HAVE WOKED DILIGENTLY WITH THE SB SEVEN SEVEN FOUR AUTHORED OFFICE. AND TO BE A PH TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS AND AVOID THE UNFORTUNATE SITUATION WE'RE IN TODAY WHICH IS IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL UNLESS AMENDMENTS ARE MADE WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE GOAL OF THE BILL WHICH IS TO PREVENT DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE F. H. AND LITIGATION DEFENSE ATTORNEYS OFTEN TRY TO ACCESS CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN WORKERS AND THE AT THE AGE TO USE AGAINST THE WORKERS. THIS MUST BE STOPPED HOWEVER THE BILL GOES ONE STEP TOO FAR. THE BILL UPENDS THE STANDARD ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE DYNAMIC AND INSTEAD GIVES COMPLETE CONTROL TO THE F. B. H. OVER THIRTY A PRIVILEGE SB SEVEN SEVENTY COURTS BERKELEY DISCLAIMED KEY ELEMENTS OF AN ATTORNEY CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. IT STATES THAT QUOTE THIS SECTION DOES NOT ESTABLISH TO BE SHARIA TRYING QUITE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AND THE F. B. H. LAWYER AND THE COMPLAINANT OR GRIEVED PERSON AND QUOTE. WORKERS TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE APPRECIATION TOURNEY TRUST WITH THE ATTORNEYS ARE OPERATING IN THEIR BEST INTEREST YET UNDER THE BILL THERE'S NO FIDUCIARY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE F. B. H. ATTORNEY AND MORE CONCERNING THE BILL RESTRICTS EMPLOYEES ABILITY TO GET RELIEF WHEN THEY RELY ON THOSE COMMUNICATIONS TO THEIR DETRIMENT. THIS CAN BE A PROBLEM IT WOULD BE A FREE AGENT TURNING ACT UNPROFESSIONALLY ARE UNINTENTIONALLY GIVE MISLEADING INFORMATION FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT THE STATUTORY DEADLINE THE OUTCOME OF AN INVESTIGATION OR ANY DEPOSIT BACK.

INCOME THE BILL WRIST WORKER ABILITY GET RELIEF WOULDN'T BE FTTH ATTORNEY PROVIDE THE INFORMATION THAT NEGATIVELY IMPACT WORKERS RIGHTS. UNDER THE BELT THE COMPLAINT WOULD FIRST HAVE TO GET THE WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE DLPH IN ORDER TO DISCLOSE THE PROBLEMATIC COMMUNICATION. AND IT WOULD BE AT THE AGE OF JACK THE COMPLAINANT WOULD HAVE NO RECOURSE. NO OTHER RECOURSE AT ALL. THE NARAL AMANDA WE SEEK WOULD SIMPLY ALLOW THE COMPLAINANT OR AGREED TO WORK TO WAIVE THE PRIVILEGE IN ORDER TO ADDRESS A CLAIM. ONE DOING BY THE DEPARTMENT FOR ERROR CAUSED BY THE DEPARTMENT. THIS AMENDMENT WOULD SHIP STOLEN SHE THE GOAL OF THE BILL WHAT ABOUT WORKERS WHO DISCLOSED. TO A DRASTICALLY UPON. OR AIR BY THE DEPARTMENT INFERRED NEED REASONS. WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL ONLINE IT IS AMENDED TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND THEN ALSO HAVE KEVIN DE. YES MORNING MISTER TURNER KEVIN DE DIDN'T CAR A FOR IF YOU CAL ACTION ALSO GOING TO BE OF UNLESS AMENDED AT THIS TIME. WE WILL BE CHRISTIAN WOULD THE CASE TECH DATA PRICE THIS BILL AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORT PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN EACH COMPLAINANT AND DEPARTMENT LAWYERS. HIS COMMUNICATIONS ARE PROTECTED BY THE ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE IN THE NL ANALOGOUS CONTEXT DEDICATION BODY YOUR C. AS CENTER HERTZBERG MENTIONED. WE BELIEVE THE RULE SHOULD BE THE SAME UNDER STATE LAW. THE COURT OF APPEAL IN THE WORST CASE BELIEVE THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER TO RECOGNIZE THAT RULE WITHOUT EXPLICIT STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO THE LEGISLATURE. HE WAS PUTTING IT UNDER COULD SPARK INTRODUCED A BILL. TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. WHICH ONLY THE TIP BETWEEN THE FEDERAL. AND THIS CASE. UNDER THIS BILL. COMPLAINANTS WOULD NOT BE TO HOLD OF THE PRIVILEGE AND THEREFORE WOULD NOT HAVE A CHOICE TO WAIVE THE PRIVILEGE HE KNOWS WHERE BUT IMPORTANT CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN THEY MAY NEED TO. UNLIKE FEDERAL LAW DEPARTMENT WOULD CONTROL WHAT COMPLAINTS CAN SAY OR WHAT THEY CAN SAY ANYTHING AT ALL. WE THERE SHOULD BE A LIMITED. THAT ALLOWS COMPLAINANTS FREEDOM TO BRING TO LIGHT POTENTIAL PROBLEMS THAT AFFECT THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS. THAT MAY BE RELEVANT TO GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT ONE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. SUCH AS THIS COMMITTEE. WHEN THINGS GO WRONG AS THEY INEVITABLY MAY. THAT'S NOT TO DIMINISH IN ANY WAY THE SKILLS ARE INTEGRITY AT THE DMV IT'S HARD WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT FOR TWENTY YEARS BOTH AS AN FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS BOTH AS AN ADVOCATE. END OF THE LEGISLATIVE ATTORNEY AND THIS DIRECTOR AND HIS ADMINISTRATION IS FAR AND AWAY THE BEST I'VE SEEN. THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF COMMON GROUND BETWEEN THE ADVOCATES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE I'M SORRY IN CONFLICT IF THERE IS A WILLINGNESS TO DO SO WE CAN SETTLE ON LANGUAGE. THAT WE NEED TO LEGITIMATE NEEDS OF THE CARPET WITHOUT UNNECESSARILY SILENCING VICTIMSOF DISCRIMINATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

MISTER CHAIRMAN WE HAVE ONE ELSE IN. ALL RIGHT YOU OVER IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISTER CAR- THANK YOU THANK YOU SURE THANK YOU SENATOR- I ALSO ENOUGH AND I APPRECIATE THE MISSION WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE. I THINK THAT EVEN THOUGH THIS BOOK IN OPPOSITION APPRECIATE. OF THE MISSION AND THE GOAL- BUT I SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS IN TERMS OF. COMPLAINTS ABILITY- TO ALSO- YOU KNOW IT. THE OFTENTIMES THE- A LAWYER CLIENT THE TYPE. SO YOU RUN WITH COMPLAINANTS ARE VICTIMS WHAT WHATEVER MIGHT BE AND THIS CASE- I RECOGNIZE THAT ALTHOUGH THE OPPOSITION. MAY COME LATER THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT FOR SOME TIME AND SO. JUST ONE YOU KNOW. YOUR YOUR HOPEFULLY A COMMITMENT- THE CONTINUE TO TRY TO FIND- THAT- FIND AGREEMENT WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY TO GIVE SOME. ABILITY FOR COMPLAINANTS TO ALSO- VERY ESPECIALLY IN IN SOME OF THE MORE EGREGIOUS SITUATIONS ANYTHING WE RECOGNIZE YOUR PH THE GREAT WORK THEY DO BUT THERE MAY BE SITUATIONS WHERE- A COMPLAINANT MAY WANT TO ALSO- REYES ISSUES AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T RESTRICT THAT NIGHT I KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT THE ISSUE IS BUT- IT'S ONE OF YOUR THOUGHTS ON. OTHER THE CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OPPOSITION AND IF THERE WILL BE A PROP FOR BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T MELMASON. MISTER. ROGERS OKAY CAN I JUST AT MY CLOTHES. SURE THANK YOU. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS GALLAGHER. YEAH I THINK WITH THIS BILL AS- WHAT WE HEARD FROM SOME OF THE OPPOSITION I THINK IT SHOWS SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WHEN YOU- WHEN WE KIND OF EXPAND THIS CONCEPT OF ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE TO NOW STATE AGENCIES ARE STATE ACTORS WHO ARE REALLY NOT. THEY'RE REALLY NOT THE PERSON'S ATTORNEY. YOU KNOW I MEAN TRADITIONALLY THIS IS A WHEN I WHEN I. DECIDE TO CONTRACT FOR LEGAL SERVICES WITH SOMEONE THAT'S WHEN ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE. YOU KNOW GOES INTO A FACT BECAUSE I'VE- YOU KNOW WOOLEY SAID YOU ARE NOW MY ADVOCATE- YOU ARE THE PERSON I WANT TO ACT ON MY BEHALF AND THEN THERE FOR THIS PRIVILEGE NOW ATTACH IS- WHEN WE START. YOU KNOW PUTTING THAT IN TERMS OF AGENCIES WHO ARE REALLY SUPPOSED TO BE AN INDEPENDENT. INVESTIGATORS ARE REALLY NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ON ANYONE'S SIDE PER SE- BUT TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER OR NOT SOMETHING IS. YOUR RUN AFOUL OF REGULATIONS AND THE APPLICABLE LAW- THAT BECOMES PROBLEMATIC AND NOW WE GET IN THE SITUATION WE'RE IN OUR- THE OPPOSITION IS SAYING CONCERNS IT WILL NOW IT'S ONLY IF THE DEPARTMENT AGREES TO WAIVE THE ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE WELL. I THINK THAT IS SOMEWHAT PROBLEMATIC AND MAYBE THAT'S WHY I MEAN ULTIMATELY I JUST AND WE MAY DISAGREE ON THIS- AND THEN THAT'S FINE I KNOW. WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM AND TRYING TO- PROPOSE THIS- BUT THE JUST ALTERNATELY- WE SHOULDN'T HAVE THE STATE AGENCY BECOME INTO THE PLACE OF AN ATTORNEY IF SOMEONE TO GET AN ATTORNEY THEY CAN GET ONE- ENDING IN SUCH CASESTHOSE WOULD BE PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATIONS. BUT I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO GET THE PLACE WE HAVE AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIVE BODY THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN BECOMING IN THE PLACE OF AN ATTORNEY AND AN ATTORNEY ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE ATTACHING. AND THEN THE ADDED PROBLEM THAT WAS BROUGHT UP OF WELL THEN MAYBE. THE AGREED PARTY WANTS TO BE ABLE TO- WAIVE THAT PRIVILEGE AND HAVING TO GET THE DEPARTMENT TO WAIVE THAT IN ORDER TO MOVE FORWARD. YEAH YOU CAN SEE HOW THAT'S GOING TO BE THAT CAN BE VERY PROBLEMATIC GOING FORWARD SO ALL TO ME I JUST THINK THAT WE SHOULD. YOU KNOW EXPAND THIS CONCEPT INTO THE AGENCY- THAT WORLD. THANK YOU HAVE A FAIR ENOUGH THAT WE HAVE A JUST A METAL AS WELL. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. GREAT SEEING NINE BECAUSE- THIS ROMERO FROM THE THEATER YOU STILL ON THE LINE. THANK YOU I THANK YOU BECAUSE MY COMMENTS ARE REALLY BEING ADDRESSED YOU SO THIS ISSUE AND I THINK THIS BILL SHOULD MOVE FORWARD TODAY BECAUSE WE DO HAVE TO ADDRESS IS A CENTER TALKED ABOUT THE WOULD. DECISION AND CLEAR UP THE FACT MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT. THE IF THE AGE WHEN THEY TAKE A CASE AND THEIR LAWYERS GET INVOLVED. THAT THEY HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF BECAUSE THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED. PROBLEMS WHERE A- A COMPLAINANT'S. IS DISCLOSING LITIGATION STRATEGY OF THE F. T. H. INAPPROPRIATELY AND THAT IS WHAT THE F. T. H. IS REALLY TRYING TO PROTECT HERE AND WHEN THEIR LAWYERS GET INVOLVED. AND THEY ARE ACTING AS ATTORNEYS THEIR CLIENTS IS THE F. E. H. AND B. COMPLAIN IT AT THAT POINT IS A WITNESS. BUT FOR D. F. E. H. A. N. D. OPPOSITION RAISES SOME VERY VALID CONCERNS ADD I WOULD LIKE TO STRESS VERY VERY STRONGLY THAT I EXPECT. EVEN THOUGH I THINK WE SHOULD MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD. I EXPECT THE FDA TO CONTINUE TO BE AT THE TABLE BECAUSE- THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THAT COMPLAIN IT BECOMES A PLAINTIFF. AND THEY HAVE THEIR OWN RIGHTS TO CARRY CASE FORWARD AND WHAT I DO NOT WANT TO SEE IT AND NOT THAT THE CURRENT. DFG H. OR THE ATTITUDES THERE OR ANYTHING THAT I AM CURRENTLY WORRIED ABOUT. BUT THIS IS A STATUTE FOR MOVING FORWARD INTO THE FUTURE AND WHAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE. IS THAT THERE ARE CONSTRUCTIVE. OPPORTUNITIES HERE TO ADDRESS IN THIS LEGISLATION THE CONCERN THAT WE DO NOT WANT THIS AGENCY OR ANY AGENCY TO HIDE BEHIND THAT ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE. WHEN IN FACT THE THINGS THAT THEY HAVE DONE POTENTIALLY PREJUDICE THE CASE OF THAT COMPLAINANT WHO HAS NOW OR INTENDS TO BECOME A PLAINTIFF. SO I THINK THAT IS A LEGITIMATE ISSUE SO D. F. E. H. I WOULD. REALLY LIKE YOU TO CONTINUE TO BE THE TABLE AND HELP US ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE IF YOU WOULD. I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT. IN THIS BILL AS IT MOVES FORWARD TO SENATOR THAT'STHAT IS KIND OF THE CAPSULE OF MY- CONCERN AND I THINK THE IF YOU TO SPEND AT THE TABLE AND TALKING ABOUT THIS BUT UNFORTUNATELY HASN'T REALLY MADE PROGRESS. SO I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE VERY INTERESTED IN IT'S NOT ENOUGH JUST TO I DON'T WANT TO SLOW DOWN THIS BILL BUT I WANT TO SEE WE'VE GOT SOME TIME OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. TO SEE IF WE CAN ADDRESS THAT SO D. F. E. H. I'M- ASKING FOR YOUR HELP HERE. IN SEEING IF WE CAN ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. MR ROMERO. YES THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND OF COURSE WE ARE- COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS- I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT- POINTED A VERY IMPORTANT POINT THAT YOU MADE CHARACTERS DOWN WHICH IS THAT UNDER SB SEVEN SEVEN FOUR IF SOMEONE WHO FILED A COMPLAINT WITH THE AT THE AGE IS NOT STEPPING INTO THE SHOES OF DLPH IS QUIET. THAT IS BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE HAS ALREADY CRAFTED A STATUTORY SCHEME IN WHICH COMPLAINANTS ARE NOT YET THE AGES CLIENT INSTEAD WITH THE HAPPY AGE EXERCISE OF ITS DISCRETION TO FILE A CIVIL ACTION HE AT THE AGE OF THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR THAT REPRESENTS THE STATE AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT UNDER EXISTING LAW DLPH IS LAWYERS CLIENT IS THE DEPARTMENT AND EXISTING LAW ALREADY PROVIDES THE CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS WITH NON CLIENTS ARE PROTECTED BY THE LAWYER CLIENT PRIVILEGE WINDOWS COMMUNICATIONS ARE REASONABLY NECESSARY FOR THE LAWYER TO REPRESENT THE CLIENT SO. SB SEVEN SEVEN BOARD SIMPLY CLARIFIES AGAINST THE CONFUSION BROUGHT BY THE COURT OF APPEALS BOARD DECISION THAT FOR DLPH LAWYERS TO REPRESENT THEIR CLIENT AGAIN THE DEPARTMENT DHS LAWYERS MUST BE ABLE TO SPEAK CONFIDENTIALLY WITH COMPLAINTS AND IN THIS REGARD IDEA PH COMPLAINANT IS LIKE A CONSULTING EXPERT WITNESS SAYS THE CHARGES RECOGNIZED EXISTING LAW AND MAKES CLEAR THAT THE LAWYER CLIENT PRIVILEGE COVERED LAWYERS CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS WITH THIRD PARTY CONSULTING EXPERTS BECAUSE THEY'RE REASONABLY NECESSARY TO THE LAWYER'S REPRESENTATION OF THEIR OWN CLIENTS. BUT THE EXPERT IS NOT THE CLIENT AND THE EXPERT CANNOT WAIVE THE CLIENT'S PRIVILEGE THE SAME IS TRUE FOR SB SEVEN SEVEN FOUR WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY PROVISION IN CALIFORNIA LAW THAT ALLOWS A THIRDPARTY LIKE AN EXPERT WITNESS. BRIDGET PH COMPLAINER TO WAIVE THE LAWYER CLIENT. I'VE GOT FORCING AGENCY LIKE THE FBI. AND OTHER JUST MAKE ONE MORE POINT WHICH IS THE AUTOMATIC. REQUEST BY THE AD. ARE NOT BE ON OF OR CALL BY ANY N. PH LAWYER. AND THE HYPOTHETICAL. THEY MAKE YOU NOT FOR THREE. FOR EXAMPLE THE ADVOCATE ASK WHAT IS THE DMV LAWYER. THE FILING DEADLINE TO A COMPLAINANT THAT MAY SEEM LIKE A FAIR QUESTION BUT IT DOES NOT REFLECT HOW DLPH ACTUALLY OPERATES OR OUR GOVERNING STATUTE IN PRACTICE HE AT THE AGE OF LAWYERS ARE NOT INVOLVED IN MOST COMPLAINTS INVESTIGATED BY KEY AT THE AGE. OF COMPLAINTS ARE INVESTIGATED BY OUR NON LAWYER INVESTIGATORS SECOND WHEN HE SB IT'S CLOSES EMPLOYMENT COMPLAINT EVEN WHEN A LAWYER HAS BECOME INVOLVED WE MUST ISSUE A RIGHT TO SUE LETTER ARE GOVERNING STATUTE. UNDER OUR GOVERNING STATUTE THE COMPLAINANT HAS ONE YEAR FROM THE RIGHT TO SUE LETTER TO FILE THEIR OWN CIVIL ACTION THE BOILERPLATE LANGUAGE AND YET BE AGES RIGHT TO SUE LETTER EXPLAINS THAT. EXPLAINED TO THE COMPLAINANT THAT THEY SHOULD SPEAK WITH THEIR OWN LAWYER ABOUT DEADLINES. SO THE IDEA THAT A GOP H. LAWYER COULD LEAD TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THEIR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS IT'S NOT A SOUND BASIS TO WRITE UNPRECEDENTED EXCEPTION TO BE AT THE AGES OWN PERCOLATES INTO LAW. WITH THAT SAID WE ARE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT AND THAT IS WHAT I'M ASKING I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THE FIRST HALF OF WHAT YOU SAID. BUT BECAUSE THESE COMPLAINANTS AND THE DISCONNECT HERE IS YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE COMPLAINANT ONLY AS AN EXPERT WITNESS AND WE UNDERSTAND HOW THAT HAPPENS. THE COMPLAINT IN THIS CASE HOWEVER CAN BECOME A PLAINTIVE AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DFG H. CANNOT HIDE BEHIND THIS. PRIVILEGE AND REFUSAL TO GIVE. PERMISSION TO THIS. WHEN IN THAT ACTION IS TO PRINT. DFV H. N. WHAT N. ATA CURRENTS OF MALFEASANCE AND I THINK THAT THERE. ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS THIS WHICH IS WHY I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE CONVERSATIONS. CAN STILL HAPPEN BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE PROBABLY WAYS. TO ADDRESS IT THAT'S THAT IS MY CONCERN. ALL RIGHT SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE. MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR YOUR- DEEP ATTENTION TO DETAIL IN THIS INTRICATE ISSUE- I THINK THAT THIS WAS A- A PROCESS IN TERMS OF GOVERNMENT ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT WAS WORKING WELL UNTIL. THE COURT IN THE WORST CASE CAME UP WITH CISION WHICH CREATED CONFUSION IN THE SPACE WHAT INTRIGUED MY ATTENTION WITH RESPECT TO BRINGING THIS ACTION WITH SPECIFIC LANGUAGE IN THE CASE WHETHER WHETHER JUDGE INVITED. THE LEGISLATURE TO PARTICIPATE TO CLARIFY WHAT IT SAYS IS INDEED OUR DIFFERENCE TO THE LEGISLATURE US IS PARTICULARLY NECESSARY WE ARE CALLED UPON TO INTERPRET THE ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE HAS DETERMINED THAT EVIDENCE SHE PRIVILEGES SHALL BE AVAILABLE ONLY AS DEFINED BY STATUTE WE RIGHT STATUTES. SO THAT WAS WHAT INFORMED THIS DECISION NOW- I THOUGHT YOUR QUESTIONS TO THE DEPARTMENT WERE QUITE GOOD- I WANTED TO SHARE THAT OUT YOU KNOW YOUR STAFF IS WORKING REALLY HARD ON THIS OUR STAFF WORKING HARD ON THIS. THE GENIE HARRISON WHO- I HOLD IN VERY HIGH REGARD BECAUSE SHE USED TO WORK FOR ME SOME DECADES AGO AT THE BEGINNING OF HER CAREER AND SHE'S A VERY GOOD LAWYER- YOU KNOW SHOULD I TALK TO HER SOME TALK SOME WEEKS AGO ABOUT SOME OF THESE IDEAS BUT WE DIDN'T GET THIS OPPOSITION LETTER UNTIL WE THOUGHT WE HAD OVER THE WEEKEND REACH AN AGREEMENT. AND THEN THIS LETTER COMES IN- ON LATE ON YESTERDAY ARM AND WE THOUGHT WE HAD IT DONE SO LOOK THE BOTTOM LINE IS TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE'S A WAY TO FURTHER CLARIFY THIS HAPPY TO DO SO WE'RE GOING TO BE MEETING WITH THE DEPARTMENT DURING THE BREAK. TO SEE IF WE CAN MAKE SOME FURTHER PROGRESS WITH RESPECT TO THESE ISSUES HAPPY TO DO THAT WE WANT TO GET IT RIGHT WE WANT TO GET IT RIGHT WE WANT TO GET IT RIGHT AND WE UNDERSTAND THE TECH WAS NATURE OF THIS BUT THE PUBLIC DOES HAVE AN INTEREST IN STOPPING THESE KINDS OF ABUSES AND CIVIL RIGHTS ADULT PUBLIC DOES HAVE AN INTEREST IN. IT IN ISSUES OF CRIMINAL LAW AND THE LIKE AND THEY DO HAVE SOME LEVEL OF STANDING I UNDERSTAND THE WORDS OF YOUR VICE CHAIR TURN THE WORDS TURNING. FROM HOW THAT WERE BUT I. THAT BEING COULD. AS SOME LEVEL BY VIRTUE OF THE WORDS VERSUS WHAT ACTUALLY IS GOING ON HERE. THE BOTTOM LINE I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR ENGAGEMENT ON THIS I APPRECIATE YOUR STAFF'S ENGAGEMENT EXTENSIVELY ON THIS. WILL CONTINUE TO SCRUB IT ANYWAY WE CAN I JUST YOU KNOW FROM MY POINT OF VIEW. I DO THE HOMEWORK I GET OUT THERE AND DO IT YOUR STEPS ON THE HOMEWORK MY STEPS ON THE HOMEWORK. AND NOW THESE ISSUES ARE BEING BROUGHT UP AFTER WE THOUGHT WE HAD A DEAL YESTERDAY LATE YESTERDAY. IT IS WHAT IT IS WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT BUT- HAD I HAD THESE THESE ARGUMENTS WITH RENEWED US. EARLIER I WOULD HAVE JUST ANSWER AND I AGAIN APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENTION TO DETAIL ON THIS NASTY RIVAL. THANK YOU I'M LOOKING FOR A MOTION. THIRTY THE MOVE BY MS GONZALEZ SECOND BY MR HOLDEN THAT MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE AYE STONE HI GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER KNOWN CHAU CHIU DAVIES DAVIES NO CONTROLS. CONSULT I HOLDEN HOLDEN I KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY KILEY NOTE MAIENSCHEIN REYES. THE BILL HAS FOUR VOTES WE NEED TO WAR SO I WILL PUT THAT ON CALL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR STAVING MEMBERS ENERGY YOUR ATTENTION TO DETAIL ON THIS THANK YOU THANK YOU RIGHT SENATOR GONZALEZ SB THREE THIRTY EIGHT. YES THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT SB THREE THIRTY EIGHT WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE TO PROTECT ESSENTIAL FRONT LINE TRUCK DRIVERS THAT CALIFORNIA'S PORTS. I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING SO DILIGENTLY WITH MY OFFICE AND ACROSS AMENDMENTS THAT CLARIFY PROCEDURES IN THE BILL AND MAKE IT STRONGER. AND I'M ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED ON PAGE TEN OF THE ANALYSIS. FOR TRUCK DRIVERS HAVE BEEN A TORY ASLI EXPLOITED BY BAD ACTORS IN THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY THESE BAD ACTORS ROUTINELY MISCLASSIFIED WORKERS TO CUT COSTS. WRONGFULLY EXCLUDE WORKERS FOR MINIMUM WAGE WORKERS COMPENSATION AND THE RIGHT TO JOIN A UNION. SB THREE THIRTY ADDRESSES ITS ONGOING PROBLEM BY ADDING TRUCKING COMPANIES TO AN EXISTING JOINT LIABILITY BAD ACTOR LIST IF THOSE COMPANIES ROUTINELY MISCLASSIFIED OR FAILED TO ADDRESS SERIOUS CAL OSHA VIOLATIONS. IT HOLDS THE MOST EGREGIOUS BAD ACTORS ACCOUNTABLE BY LOWERING THE THRESHOLD TO GET PUT ON THE BAD ACTOR LIST FOR PRIOR OFFENDERS. THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN FOUND TO HAVE MISCLASSIFIED WORKERS CURRENTLY HAS NO OPPOSITION AND I'VE WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON BOTH SIDES TO ENSURE THAT THE LANGUAGE IS TARGETED TO FOCUS ONLY ON TRULY BAD ACTORS LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD FOR THE CONTRACT TRUCKING COMPANIES- TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT TODAY HAVE SHANE GUSMAN. THE CALIFORNIA TEAMSTERS PUBLIC AFFAIRS COUNCIL AND CAITLIN VEGA FROM THE INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS PORT DIVISION THINKING I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER I DID HEAR A MOTION FROM. THIS GONZALEZ IS THEIR SECOND. AND THE SECOND FOR MISTER. THANK YOU SO I DO HAVE THOSE TWO WITNESSES LISTED SHANE GUSMAN AND CAITLIN VEGA CHAIN GUSTON. GOOD MORNING SHE DOES NOT BEHALF FOR THE CALIFORNIA TEAMSTERS PUBLIC AFFAIRS COUNCIL IN SUPPORT AND PRACTICAL SPONSOR THIS BILL. PRESS THE POINT OF THIS BILL IS TO ADDRESS THE LONG HISTORY OF DRIVER MISS CLASSIFICATION THAT HAS OCCURRED IN THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY EVER SINCE IT WAS THE REGULATED FOR DECADES AGO. NO WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE OF THIS PROBLEM GREATER THAN OUR LARGEST PORTS. THERE EXPLICATION OF THE DOMINANT ECONOMIC MODEL TRUCKING COMPANIES HIRE A WORKFORCE OF MOSTLY IMMIGRANT DRIVERS. WHO ARE FORCED TO ACT AS IF THEY ARE IN BUSINESS FOR THEMSELVES. RESPONSIBLE FOR PURCHASING OR LEASING THEIR OWN TRUCKS PAYING FOR ALL OF THE FUEL AND MAINTENANCE AND ALL THE WHILE ACCEPTING EXTREMELY LOW NONNEGOTIABLE RIGHT. IT'S NOT UNCOMMON TO HAVE MONTHS WHERE THE COST OF MAINTAINING THE TRUCK IS ACTUALLY MORE THAN THE DRIVER MAKES. ON TOP OF THAT SPEECH DRIVERS GET NO HEALTHCARE NO MINIMUM WAGE NO OVERTIME NO WORKERS COMP NO PAID SICK DAYS AND ABSOLUTELY NO HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTECTIONS. LIKE THOSE THAT WERE NEEDED DURING THE PANDEMIC. THIS IS NOT HYPERBOLE THESE ARE THE FACTS ON THE GROUND. HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS LABOR COMMISSIONER. INVESTIGATIONS AND LAWSUITS HAVE UNIVERSALLY CONCLUDED WITH FINDING THAT THE PORT DRAYAGE DRIVERS ARE IN FACT MISCLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES. COUNTLESS NEWS ARTICLES HAVE CHRONICLED THIS PROBLEM FOR MANY YEARS NONETHELESS THE PROBLEM PROCESS. THE TEAMSTERS COMMUNITY GROUPS AND OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO HELP THESE DRIVERS UNFORTUNATELY. THE WAY THEY ARE MISCLASSIFIED AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. HAS MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO ACT COLLECTIVELY.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AGAIN- BEFORE I BEGIN I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED ON PAGE TEN OF THE ANALYSIS AND WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF AS WELL FOR THEIR DILIGENCE. I'M I'M HERE TO PRESENT SB SEVEN SEVEN SIX WHICH WILL MAKE VARIOUS STATUTORY CHANGES TO ENHANCE THE STATE WATER BOARD IN A ABILITY. TO MORE EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY IMPLEMENT THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE. DRINKING WATER ACT IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED AND GOVERNOR NEWSOM SIGN SB TWO HUNDRED WHICH ANNUALLY DIRECTED ABOUT THE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TO FUND THE SAFE DRINKING WATER EFFORTS. AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. THE STATE WATER BOARD HAS WORKED HARD TO IMPLEMENT THE LEGISLATURE'S VISION FOR THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER PROGRAM BUT AS IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF CLARIFYING STATUTORY CHANGES. THAT ARE NEEDED QUICKLY EFFICIENTLY TO PROVIDE FUNDING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THESE EFFICIENCIES INCLUDE CLARIFYING DEFINITIONS AUTHORIZING THE BOARD TO MAKE ADVANCE PAYMENTS PROVIDING THE AUTHORITY TO ACT EXPEDITIOUSLY TO PURCHASE EMERGENCY BOTTLED WATER. AND PROVIDING THE ABILITY TO QUICKLY SEND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS INTO A FAILING SYSTEM. IF IS A PROFICIENCY CHANGES ARE BALANCED BY THE BILL'S PROVISIONS THAT RECAST AND CONSOLIDATE THE BOARD'S ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT AND FINING AUTHORITY TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE'S FUNDS DO NOT FALL VICTIM. TO FRAUD OR ABUSE IT'S A VERY THOUGHTFUL AND MEASURED APPROACH THAT PROVIDES EFFICIENCIES THAT THE WATER BOARD. NEEDS TO BE NIMBLE AND EFFECTIVE IN ENSURING SB TWO HUNDRED FUNDS ARE OUT THE DOOR INTO COMMUNITIES THAT NEED IT THE MOST. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT TODAY I HAVE YOU ON THE WEST OF THE DIRECTOR. THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF ENFORCEMENT AT THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD THINKING I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU SENATOR I DO HAVE THE ONE WITNESS LISTED.

AN EMPLOYEE FLETCHER PASSED IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED SB TWO HUNDRED TO SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER ACT. THE STATE WATER BOARD HAS IDENTIFIED SEVERAL TECHNICAL CHANGES THAT ARE NEEDED TO HELP COMMUNITIES MORE QUICKLY. SB SEVEN SEVEN SIX WILL ALLOW THE WATER BOARD TO ADOPT EMERGENCY REGULATIONS TO ENSURE THAT DRINKING WATER QUALITY DATA IS READILY AVAILABLE. YOU'LL DO THIS BY SENDING THE WATER BOARD'S AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE TECHNICAL REPORTS FROM STATE SMALL WATER SYSTEM. IS REQUIREMENTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE BOARD'S CURRENT AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE. THE SAME INFORMATION FROM THE LARGER PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION SB SEVEN SEVEN SIX ALLOW THE WATER BOARD TO ADDRESS EMERGENCY SITUATIONS THAT OCCUR AT A FAILING WATER SYSTEM. BY PROVIDING UP TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AN EIGHT WITHOUT A WRITTEN AGREEMENT FOR EXAMPLE BY PROVIDING. FOR BEING ABLE I HAVE TO PROVIDE BOTTLED WATER. THE BILL ALSO AUTHORED THE BOARD TO MAKE IT PAYMENTS SMALL. MORE QUICKLY ACCESS SAFE DRINKING WATER. A LOT OF WORK AND GENERALLY MAKE PAYMENTS ON A REIMBURSEMENT BASIS HOWEVER THIS PROCESS CAN BE FINANCIALLY BURDENSOME UNDER FINANCIAL COMMUNITIES THAT DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOW FOR UP FRONT PAYMENT. SB SEVEN SEVEN SIX WILL ALSO INCLUDE AN EXEMPTION FROM CERTAIN STATE CONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN PROVIDED. IN THE PAST IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT WHICH WERE NOT INCLUDED IN SB TWO HUNDRED. THIS PROVISION WILL ALIGN OF THE DOUBLE LINE THE LEGISLATURE CONTENT AND ALLOW THE WATER BOARD'S MORE QUICKLY ACCESS. DRINKING WATER. MORE QUICKLY ADDRESS THE TRACKING WATER EMERGENCIES. AND FINALLY SB SEVEN SEVEN SIX WILL PREVENT. AND ADDRESS POTENTIAL FRAUD IN THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER PROGRAM FUN BY NEARING EXISTING AUTHORITIES CURRENTLY EXERCISED BY THE WATER BOARD IN OTHER FUNDS ADMINISTERED THAT WE MINISTER.

THEIR THE MOTION IS THEIR SECOND AND THE SECOND THANK YOU SORRY CENTER GO AHEAD PLEASE THANK YOU AT- THIS BILL IS A MODEST STEP TOWARD IMPROVING FOR THE STATE'S COLLECTION AND HANDLING OF DATA INVOLVING INFECTIOUS DISEASE. I AM PLEASED TO ACCEPTED THE MOMENT SUGGESTED BY YOUR STAFF THANK YOU I BASICALLY THE BILL PROPOSES TO SMALL STEPS TO BEGIN CLOSING THE DATA GAP. THAT HAS KEPT US FROM FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE SPREAD OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE. AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE METHODS WE USE TO CONTROL IT. MORE THAN A YEAR AFTER COVERT NINETEEN TOOK THE FIRST OF MORE THAN SIXTY THOUSAND LIVES IN CALIFORNIA. WE STILL HAVE VERY LITTLE SCIENCE. TO EXPLAIN WHAT CONDITIONS MADE THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS MORE OR LESS LIKELY. AND WE HAVE LITTLE DATA TO SHOW WHICH OF THE STEPS WE TOOK TO STOP THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS WORKED. AND WHICH DID NOT. A PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS AND WE AS POLICY MAKERS HAVE BEEN RELYING. LARGELY BLIND. EARLIER THIS YEAR THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST NOTED THAT OUR COVERT RESPONSE. SEPARATE FROM OUTDATED DATA COLLECTION ANALYSIS AND REPORTING SYSTEMS. THREE ANALYSTS RECOMMENDED THAT WE UNDERTAKE A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE SYSTEMS AS A PART OF A SWEEPING AFTER ACTION LOOK AT HOW OUR STATE DEALT WITH THIS UNPRECEDENTED THREAT. WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. BUT THIS BILL DOES ONLY TWO SIMPLE THINGS FIRST IT WOULD AD DETAIL TO THREE OF THE MANY QUESTIONS HEALTH PROVIDERS ASK THOSE WHO TEST POSITIVE ABOUT WHERE THEY MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN INFECTED. IF WE KNOW MORE ABOUT HOW I DISEASE MIGHT BE SPREADING WE CAN TAKE SMARTER STEPS TO STOP ITS SPREAD. SECOND THE BILL MAKES CHANGES TO AN EXISTING SYSTEM FOR SHARING DATA WITH BONA FIDE RESEARCHERS. SO THAT OUR BEST SCIENTISTS CAN STUDY THE SPREAD OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE IN REAL TIME. AND PROVIDE US WITH THE INFORMATION WE NEED TO MAKE INTELLIGENT DECISIONS. ARE BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE STATE TO CREATE A SPECIAL PANEL DURING EMERGENCIES. TO EVALUATE RESEARCH REQUESTS AND EITHER APPROVE OR DENY THEM IN FIFTEEN DAYS. THE BILL REQUIRES THIS EXPEDITED PROCESS OF AYE BY ALL OF THE EXISTING PRIVACY PROTECTIONS IN LAW. AND WE EVEN ADD SOME NEW ONES. THIS CAN BE DONE WHILE STILL BEING MINDFUL THAT IN A PANDEMIC. EVERY DAY THAT GOES BY IT'S COSTING CALIFORNIANS THEIR LIVES. MEMBERS IT'S TOO LATE TO SAVE THE LIVES OF THOSE WHO HAVE DIED DURING THIS TERRIBLE PANDEMIC BUT IT'S NEVER TOO EARLY TO PREPARE. FOR THE NEXT ONE THIS BILL WILL HELP US DO JUST THAT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR NIGHT OF. THANK YOU SENATOR AND I DO HAVE A WITNESS LISTED DR GEOFF LEE. JEFFREY KLAUSNER. OF UNIVERSITY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. DR COSTNER YOU ON THE LINE. YES MY NAME IS DR JEFFREY KLAUSNER I'M A PRACTICING INTERNIST INFECTIOUS DISEASE SPECIALIST MEDICAL EPIDEMIOLOGIST AND PROFESSOR OF POPULATION AND PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENCES UNIVERSITY SELLING CALIFORNIA TECHNICAL MEDICINE ALSO FORMER SAN FRANCISCO DEPUTY HEALTH OFFICER AND CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER AS BIG AND STRONG SUPPORTED SENATE BILL SEVEN FOUR FOUR WHICH WOULD ADD NEW DATA ELEMENTS TO COMMUNICABLE RESPIRATORY DISEASE REPORTING. AND REQUIRE THE STATE TO SECURELY SHARE YEAH THAT THE IDENTIFIED DATA TO ENABLE CALIFORNIA BASED ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS TO PERFORM EPIDEMIOLOGIC ANALYSIS THE STATE CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE THE CORVETTE NINETEEN HAS BEEN AN ABJECT FAILURE WITH OVER SIXTY THREE THOUSAND- THINK COUNTING NEARLY POPULATIONS OF COLOR. YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THAT FAILURE HAS BEEN THE POOR USE OF THAT THE LOGIC DATA AND THE INABILITY OF THE STATE TO USE AVAILABLE DATA TO CREATE A TARGET RESPONSE TO FOCUSED INTERVENTIONS TO LIMIT THE COLLATERAL DAMAGE CAUSED BY BROAD BASED STATEWIDE POLITICS. BECAUSE THE DECADE THE FUNDING CUTS TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THE STATE HAS LIMITED CAPACITY TO ANALYZE DATA THAT IT DOES COLLECT FURTHERMORE THE DATA COLLECTED ARE INCOMPLETE AND INSUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT OF SCIENCE BASED RESPONSE. THE LACK OF GOOD DATA RESULTED IN THE NEGLECT OF POTENTIAL WORKERS THE FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT TESTING IN THE WORK FORCE AND THE FAILURE TO IDENTIFY AND CONTROL THE SPREAD OF INFECTION. ON THE FLIP SIDE THE CLOSURE OF SCHOOLS PLAYGROUNDS AND OUTDOOR SPACES RECOMMENDATIONS OF UNFOUNDED INTERVENTIONS LIKE DEEP CLEANING ACTIVITIES AND TEMPERATURE SCREENING WE'RE NOT BASED ON GOOD DATA BECAUSE WE SIMPLY DID NOT HAVE ANY SENATE BILL SEVEN FOUR FOUR WOULD BE A STEP TOWARD RIGHTING THE STATE'S FELL PUBLIC ON SYSTEM BY ADDING RELEVANT. RESPIRATORY DISEASE EXPOSURE ELEMENTS DESPITE WHAT YOU MIGHT HEAR SOON COLLECTING THE ADDED. DATA ELEMENTS ARE NOT COVERED IT INTO PRACTICE THINK WHEN IT LIKE MY- YOUR UNDERMINE REAL. BETWEEN THE AND THE TO. DOCTORS ARE TO COLLECT THOSE X. ARE. WORK PLAYED OUT TYPE DENSITY TRAVEL. IN THAT SCHOOL AS PART OF A ROUTINE MEDICAL HISTORY FURTHERMORE SUCH DATA OFTEN SELF REPORTED BY PATIENTS AMONG REGISTRATION AND ENTERED INTO ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD BY ANCILLARY STAFF MEMBERS- SUCH AS WHEN THEY RECORDED SHARON'S INFORMATION OR HOME ADDRESS. IN RESPONSE THE COVE IN NINETEEN PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN WORKING IN THE DARK THERE'S NO WONDER THE DAMAGE HAS BEEN SEVERE WITH BETTER DATA SHARED IN ACCESS TO WE CAN LEVERAGE OUR EXISTING RESOURCES THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

ALL RIGHT THANK YOU OPERATOR YOU MAY CLOSE THE LINES WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. QUESTIONS COMMENTS MR GALLAGHER. YEAH THANKS THANK YOU SENATOR FOR BRING IN THIS- MEASURE FOR AND I AND I THINK IT TOUCHES ON SOMETHING. REALLY IMPORTANT THAT I THAT WE- SAW DURING THIS PANDEMIC WHICH IS. THAT YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE DECISIONS. SEEM TO BE MADE AT THE COUNTY HEALTH- OFFICIAL LEVEL LEVEL AND THE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH- LEVEL- AND NO DOUBT VERY SMART AND- GREAT PEOPLE WORKING IN THOSE FIELDS AND ON THE FRONT LINES OF THIS- BUT- IT SEEM LIKE WE DID NOT GET A LOT OF INFORMATION AND IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE THERE AS A LOT OF SHARING. GOING ON WITH OUR ACADEMIC COMMUNITY WHICH I THINK IS VERY CRITICAL WE HAVE SOME GREAT PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS IN ACADEMIA HERE IN THE STATE- AND I THINK THIS GETS SAID HEY WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THIS DATA IS BEING SHARED. AND EVEN TIMES WHEN. WE WOULD INQUIRE OF WHERE ARE YOU GETTING THE DATA THAT SUPPORTS THE DECISION THAT IS COMING OUT OF THIS AND WE'D BE TOLD WELL WE CAN'T SHARE THAT. DATA WITH YOU TO BE TO BE SOMEONE WHO IS IN ELECTED OFFICE AND WHO. CONSTITUENTS LOOK TO FOR ANSWERS AS TO WHY THINGS ARE HAPPENING WHY DECISIONS ARE COMING OUT OF THE STATE. AND THEN TO INQUIRE ME TOLD WELL WE CAN'T GIVE YOU THAT DATA WE CAN'T SHARE THAT DATA- IS EXTREMELY PROBLEMATIC SO I THINK THIS BILL IS A GOOD FIRST STEP OF ENSURING THAT WE- FIRST OF ALL SHARE THIS INFORMATION WITH OUR RESEARCHERS AND- AND SOME REALLY. BRIGHT PEOPLE IN ACADEMIA DR CLUSTER IS ONE OF THOSE WHEN YOU'RE WITNESSES AND DID WAS VERY HELPFUL TO ME. IN EXPLAINING SOME OF THE YOU KNOW DIFFERENT. NUANCES OF- OF THIS PANDEMIC AND HOW TO HOW TO RESPOND. BUT WHEN THOSE DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE IN A VACUUM. AND WITH SORT OF A GROUP THINK MENTALITY. I DON'T THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE AS MUCH INFORMATION AND UTILIZE. OUR ACADEMIC NON PROFIT- YOU KNOW THAT IT IS NOT JUST STATE OR COUNTY EMPLOYEE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS- YOU HAVE THE ONLY KNOWLEDGE- TO MAKE THE BEST RESPONSES AND BEST DECISIONS REGARDING PANDEMIC I DID WE REALLY NEED TO BE UTILIZING- ALL OF OUR RESOURCES ARE GREAT ACADEMIC RESOURCES IN MAKING THOSE DECISIONS SO- THIS. TO ME IS A GREAT FIRST STEP AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE MEASURE. THANK YOU THE THREATS. SENATOR THIS IS YOU MAY NOTE LAST YEAR I INTRODUCED EIGHTY SIX EIGHTY FIVE WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE REPORTING BY EMPLOYERS WHEN SOMEBODY WAS. THOSE AFFECTED WITH COVERT. I LOVE WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE AND I HOPE THAT IN THE END WE GET THAT INFORMATION I'M VERY CONCERNED THAT THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. BUT I ABSOLUTELY WILL SUPPORT THIS AND HOPE THAT. THERE ARE. THE SAFEGUARDS ARE PUT THERE TO MAKE SURE THAT INDEED WHAT YOU WANT DONE AND THE INFORMATION THAT YOU WANT DONE AND EVERYBODY WHO SHOULD BE REPORTING- FROM WILL BE DONE. SO THAT WE REALLY DO GET THE INFORMATION TO EVALUATE THIS SO- I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND LOOK FORWARD TO FINALLY GETTING THESE REPORTS THAT PROVIDE THE INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN BETTER TRACK. HOW PEOPLE ARE GETTING. THESE COMMUNICABLE RESPIRATORY DISEASES THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS SAYING NONE SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS HERE- KIND COMMENTS TODAY. YEAH ONE OF THE MOST STUNNING FACTS ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE JUST GONE THROUGH IS THIS THAT. ADMITS THAT THAT THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE INFECTED THE COLLECTION OF. HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS IN DATA. DURING A PANDEMIC OF THIS INCREDIBLE MAGNITUDE. THAT THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE APPROVED REQUESTS FOR RESEARCH. AND THAT FOR THAT DATA NOW WE HAVE A PROCESS IN PLACE IT'S CUMBERSOME AND SLOW BUT EVEN GIVEN THAT ISN'T IT AMAZING THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE OUR OUR BEST MINDS IN THE STATE HAVE ACCESS TO USABLE DATA TO HELP US MAKE GOOD DECISIONS. ALL THE WAY DOWN THE LINE IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT THING THAT WE HAVE GONE THROUGH AND WE'RE STILL GONG THROUGH. I'M HOPEFUL THAT THIS CAN HELP IMPROVE OUR RESPONSE GOING FORWARD HOPEFULLY WILL NEVER HAPPEN IN OUR LIVES- BUT WE NEED TO DO THINGS BETTER WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND THIS BILL WILL HELP THANK YOU FOR YOUR- CONSIDERATION TODAY.

I'VE NEVER SIXTEEN SB TWO SEVENTY WELCOME. THANK YOU GOOD ACTORS BECAUSE IT AFTERNOON NOT YET ALMOST MORNING- CHAIR AND MEMBERS SB TWO SEVENTY WILL ENSURE PUBLIC EMPLOYER GOING TO STATIONS RECEIVE ACCURATE AND TIMELY BARGAINING UNIT INFORMATIO WHICH THEY ARE ALREADY ENTITLED TO BY LAW SO THAT THEY MAY FULFILL THEIR LEGAL REPRESENTATIONAL DUTIES AND MEET THE NEEDS OF THE BARGAINING UNIT AS A WHOLE- I'D OF SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY SIX LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES. TWO HUNDRED FORTY TWO HAVE NOT SUBMITTED THE MONTHLY NEW HIRE LIST AS REQUIRED BY CURRENT LAW. SINCE THE START OF THE CALENDAR YEAR WITH NO CONSEQUENCES WE MERELY WANT TO ESTABLISH ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES WITH PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EMPLOYER TO CURE THE PROBLEM RESPOND AND AVOID ANY INVOLVEMENT FROM PER. THIS MEASURE CREATES NO NEW REQUIREMENTS FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYERS IT'S SIMPLY A CENTER VISES COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING LAW AND PROVIDE SPEC FLEXIBILITY TO EMPLOYERS SO THAT THEY MAY MEET THE CURRENT LEGAL OBLIGATIONS. AND EMPLOYEES COLLECTIVE BARGAINING REPRESENTATIVE HAS A MORAL AND LEGAL DUTY TO WATCH OUT FOR THE WELFARE OF THEIR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. WHO IN TURN WATCH OUT FOR THE PUBLIC'S WELLBEING. IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT ORGANIZATION- EMPLOYER ORGANIZATIONS RECEIVE THE INFORMATION AS REQUIRED BY LAW ON A TIMELY BASIS- THERE'S NOTHING IN THE BILL THAT RESTRICTS THE ABILITY OF UNIONS AND EMPLOYERS TO RESOLVE VIOLATIONS WITHOUT INVOLVING PER OR PENALTIES. FOR THESE REASONS I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY BRING SB TWO SEVENTY BEFORE YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR I HAVE TWO WITNESSES LISTED SANDRA FERRERO FROM THE C. S. C. A. WHO IS HERE IN PERSON GOOD AND THEN LEVY SANCHEZ ON THE TELEPHONE. GO AHEAD PLEASE. GOOD ALMOST AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS SANDRA BARRERA ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION WE ARE CO SPONSORS OF THIS BILL AS SENATOR DRAWS OF STATED THIS BILL INTENDS TO ADDRESS PUBLIC EMPLOYERS WHO ROUTINELY VIOLATE THE LAW AND MAKE NO EFFORT TO COMPLY THE INFORMATION EMPLOYERS ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDEIS TIME SENSITIVE AND RESOLVING VIOLATIONS DIRECTLY WITH EMPLOYERS IS THE FASTEST WAY TO RECEIVE IT. THE PER PROCESS CAN TAKE AROUND ONE YEAR. SINCE WE NEED THE INFORMATION AT SPECIFIC INTERVALS IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO GO THROUGH PER UNLESS THE PLAN PLAYER HAS A HISTORY OF EGREGIOUS VIOLATIONS. A BORDER AGENT CANNOT ASSESS A PENALTY AT THE INITIAL INFORMAL LEVELS WITHIN PER. A PENALTY CAN ONLY BE ASSESSED BY AN ALJ AFTER A FORMAL HEARING. THE ATTORNEYS FEES PROVISION DISINCENTIVE ISIS FRIVOLOUS APPEALS THAT WASTES TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND ATTORNEY'S FEES WOULD ONLY ACCRUE. IF A PARTY APPEALS AN ALJ DECISION AND THE DECISION IS ULTIMATELY UP HELD. THERE ARE PROTECTIONS FOR EMPLOYERS IN THE BILL. ONE IS THE NOTICE REQUIREMENT A UNION IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE EMPLOYER WITH NOTICE BEFORE FILING A PER CHARGE INCLUDING THE SPECIFIC VIOLATIONS. AND IF THE VIOLATION IS MISSING OR INACCURATE DATA A UNION IS REQUIRED TO WAIT TEN DAYS BEFORE FILING UP CURB. UNLESS THE UNION HAS ALREADY PROVIDED THE TEN DAYS MORE THAN THREE TIMES IN TWELVE MONTHS. THE NOTICE REQUIREMENT AND CURE PERIOD ARE NOT IN EXISTING LAW. MUST ALSO CONSIDER THE SEVERITY OF THE VIOLATION BEFORE ASSESSING A PENALTY. AND SINCE THERE IS NO MINIMUM PENALTY AMOUNT INCLUDED IN THE BILL AND L. J. COULD ASSESS A PENALTY OF ONE CENT. IT'S AGAINST THE UNION'S BEST INTEREST TO PENALIZE THE SAME ENTITIES WE NEGOTIATE WITH ON COMPENSATION PROPOSALS OUR GOAL IS TO GET THE INFORMATION WE NEED TO REPRESENT OUR MEMBERS. SB TWO SEVENTY WILL MOTIVATE EMPLOYERS WHO WILLFULLY VIOLATE THE LAW TO REACH COMPLIANCE BY THE BILL'S ENACTMENT DATE OF JULY TWENTY TO. RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND THEN THE B. SANCHEZ WITH US ON THE TELEPHONE. GOOD MORNING MR CARE AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LUÍT SANCHEZ ON BEHALF OF THE SEIU CALIFORNIA PROUD CO SPONSOR OF THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. IT IS OUR SINCEREST HOPE BUT THE RESULT OF THAT FEE TO SEVENTY WILL BE THAT UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE CHARGES ARISING OUT OF VIOLATIONS OF GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION THIRTY FIVE FIFTY EIGHT. NO LONGER HAVE TO BE FILED AND THAT THE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS PROVISIONS THAT THE MEASURE WILL NEVER HAVE TO BE RELIED UPON. THIS BILL DOES NOTHING TO CHANGE AN EMPLOYER'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER EXISTING LAW AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE UNDER EXISTING LAW THE MAJORITY OF EMPLOYERS HAVE FOUND IT EASY TO COMPLY. AND ARE IN FACT IN FULL COMPLIANCE SO WHY IS THIS BILL NECESSARY. BECAUSE IN THE SHORT PINE GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION THIRTY FIVE FIFTY EIGHT HAVE BEEN ON THE BOOKS. SOME EMPLOYERS HAVE SIMPLY BEEN UNWILLING TO COMPLY WITH THE STRAIGHTFORWARD AND NOT UNDULY BURDENSOME OBLIGATIONS CONTAINED THEREIN. IT IS UNFORTUNATELY BECOME ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT THE LACK OF COMPLIANCE. ONLY TO AN EMPLOYER'S ABILITY TO SCORE COMPLIANCE WITH IMPUNITY IN OTHER WORDS EMPLOYERS AREN'T AFRAID OF THE REPERCUSSIONS OF VIOLATION BECAUSE THERE REALLY ARE NOT. EXCEPT OF COURSE THE PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYEES AND THEIR UNIONS WHO ARE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED IN NUMEROUS WAYS BY THE VIOLATIONS. IF THE INTENT OF LABOR LAWS ARE TO LEVEL AND ON LEVEL PLAYING FIELD THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THE GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION THIRTY FIVE FIFTY EIGHT ACT IN THE EQUALISING MANNER. THE LEGISLATURE INTENDED GIVING SCOFFLAW EMPLOYERS STATUTORY KNOWLEDGE THEY NEED TO COMPLY AND IN NO WAY DILATORY ASLI. AFFECTING GOOD ACTORS. SO IT'S PROBABLY% IS A THOUGHTFUL AND- BOUND APPROACH TO RUN THE PROBLEM. FIRST BILL TO BE IN THE LAST QUARTER COMPLY WITH THE LAW AND NOT HAPPENED NO YOU ARE. NO FOR A THIRTY AND- EFFECTIVE THE BILL ENCOURAGES LOCAL BY PROVIDING THE TO CARE AND IF. A CALL A FOR DEEP YOU STRUCTURE AGAIN THIS IS A BILL ARE HOPEFUL OPTIMA WILL IF EVER HAVE TO BE BUT WITHOUT IT THE PROTECTION THE LEGISLATURE THOUGHT THEY WERE IMPARTING TO PUBLIC SECTOR WORKERS UNDER GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION THIRTY FIVE FIFTY EIGHT WILL CONTINUE TO BE ALL BUT ILLUSORY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NOW WE WILL MOVE TO OTHERS IN SUPPORT IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN THE CHAMBERS WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. OF SB TWO SEVENTY GO AHEAD PLEASE THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MAC CRIMMINS HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NEVADA CONFERENCE OF OPERATING ENGINEERS.

THANK YOU WE WILL THEN MOVE TO OPPOSITION I DO NOT HAVE ANY OPPOSITION WITNESSES LISTED SO IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN THE CHAMBERS WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. GO AHEAD PLEASE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AT JASON SCHMELZER HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF PRISM PUBLIC RISK INNOVATION SOLUTIONS IN MANAGEMENT FIRST I JUST WANNA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THE MEMBERS AND STAFF FOR THE COMMITTEE FOR SPENDING SO MUCH TIME TALKING TO US ABOUT THIS BILL BUT ALSO WANT TO THANK THE CO SPONSORS AFTER THREE MEETINGS THAT THEY'VE HAD WITH US AYE AND THE SENATOR- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONVERSATION I THINK EVERYBODY'S TRYING TO GET TO A GOOD PLACE SELL. AT SECOND I JUST WANT TO SAY YOU KNOW IT SAID THIS CLEARLY BEFORE I'LL SAY IT AGAIN WE'RE NOT HERE- I THINK TO OPPOSE THIS BILL ON BEHALF OF EMPLOYERS WHO ARE SIMPLY NOT PROVIDING THE REQUIRED LISTS TO THEIR PUBLIC EMPLOYEE UNIONS THAT IS NOT WHY WE'RE HERE- WE UNDERSTAND WHY THE AUTHOR IN THE SPONSORS WOULD WANT TO IMPOSE PENALTIES AND PROTECT THEMSELVES I WITH ATTORNEYS FEES AND COURT COSTS IN THAT SCENARIO. WHAT WE ARE CONCERNED WITH IS THE WAY THAT YOU SEVENTY STRUCTURES ITSELF AS IT PERTAINS TO INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE LIST SO HERE'S WHAT THE BILL DOES IT HOLD PUBLIC EMPLOYERS TO STANDARD THE CAMPING MAT- ONE OF PERFECTION ANY SINGLE VIOLATION ANY SINGLE INCORRECT DATA FIELD. IN THE LIST PROVIDED TO EMPLOYERS IS GROUNDS FOR A VIOLATION OF THE UNION CAN. CHOOSE TO. PURSUE THAT VIOLATION. AT TELLS EMPLOYERS WHO FILE SEVERAL HUNDRED OF THESE LISTS IN THE YEAR THEY CAN ONLY FIX THEIR ERRORS THREE TIMES IN THE CALENDAR YEAR BEFORE BEING SUBJECT TO AN UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE CHARGE OF THE UNION'S DISCRETION. AND IT ALLOWS PROBE TO LEVY PENALTIES THE GO TO THE GENERAL FUND AN ATTORNEY'S FEES AND COURT COSTS FOR THE UNION. WE SUGGESTED THAT THE BILL BE AMENDED TO ALLOW PUBLIC EMPLOYERS TO UTILIZE THE CURE PROVISION. ANY TIME THAT THEY'RE NOTIFIED OF AN INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE LIST. OF BY THE UNION. UNDER THE PROVISION OF THE UNION WOULD HAVE THE CORRECT INFORMATION IN TEN DAYS OR- EVERY REMEDY UNDER THE BILL AS IT'S CURRENTLY DRAFTED WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO THEM SO THEY WOULD EITHER GET TIMELY DATA WHICH WE HEARD JUST NOW WAS THE PURPOSE FOR THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO ENFORCE. AS INDICATED IN THE BILL. THIS WOULD PRODUCE THE ACCURATE DATA DESIRED IN A TIMELY MANNER AND ALSO PLAYS THE BAD ACTORS BUT WHAT IT WOULDN'T DO IS HOLD EMPLOYERS TO AN IMPOSSIBLE STANDARD. AB SO WITH THAT I DO WANT TO REPLY- SPECIFICALLY TO PAGE FIVE THE ANALYSIS WHERE IT'S KIND OF ASSERTED THAT PER WILL BE THE LAST RESORT FOR THE UNIONS AND THEN YOU JUST HEARD THIS FROM THE SPONSORS AS WELL. AB THAT MAY BE THE CASE THAT THE UNIONS MAY NOT PURSUE- WHAT WHAT THEY COULD WHICH IS A VIOLATION ON EVERY REPORT. BUT IF THAT'S GOING TO BE THE OUTCOME MAYBE THE BILL SHOULD REFLECT THAT AT THE STANDARD IN THE BILL THE WORDS ON THE PAGE. OUR OUR PERFECTION AND POSSIBILITY OF VIOLATION FOR ANY TIME YOU'RE NOT PERFECT WE THINK THAT THAT SHOULD BE CHANGED. AND I WOULD LOVE TO WORK OUT AMENDMENTS IN THAT REGARD AND REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION.
