PART OF A GROUP OF PEOPLE

00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:15.587
WITHIN THE CITY OF BERKLEY THAT

00:19:15.654 --> 00:19:17.990
WROTE THE VERY FIRST TO SEE

00:19:18.056 --> 00:19:19.491
THAT STEP WAS THE FIFTY CENT

00:19:19.558 --> 00:19:21.226
RECYCLING GOAL IN THE STATE OF

00:19:21.293 --> 00:19:22.861
CALIFORNIA IN THE WHOLE U. S.

00:19:22.928 --> 00:19:25.197
ACTUALLY WAS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY

00:19:25.264 --> 00:19:28.300
TWO. AND OF COURSE AT THAT

00:19:28.367 --> 00:19:30.836

HERE. THAT MARKET IS PRETTY

00:20:06.238 --> 00:20:09.174

DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO SOLVE

00:28:01.246 --> 00:28:03.181
THIS TERRIBLE CRISIS WE'VE HAD

00:28:03.248 --> 00:28:04.649
IN SOME AMAZING WORK IN THIS

00:28:04.716 --> 00:28:06.384
BODY OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS

00:28:06.451 --> 00:28:08.620
AND I APPLAUD THAT. BUT OUR

00:28:08.686 --> 00:28:11.356
WORK IS NOT DONE. SENATE BILL

00:28:11.423 --> 00:28:12.557
FIFTY ADDRESSES ONE OF THE

00:28:12.624 --> 00:28:14.426
FUNDAMENTAL MATHEMATICAL

00:28:14.492 --> 00:28:16.795
LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY AS A

00:28:16.861 --> 00:28:18.430
STATE TO HAVE ENOUGH HOUSING

00:28:18.496 --> 00:28:19.731
FOR EVERYONE WHO NEEDS A-

00:28:19.798 --> 00:28:22.367
RESTRICTIVE. EXCLUSIONARY

00:28:22.434 --> 00:28:24.869
ZONING THAT PREVENTS THE

00:28:24.936 --> 00:28:25.403
CONSTRUCTION OF AFFORDABLE

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:27.605
HOUSING. HENCE THE DESTRUCTIVE

00:28:27.672 --> 00:28:29.441
CONSTRUCTION OF APARTMENT

00:28:29.507 --> 00:28:31.576
BUILDINGS IN THE LARGE MAJORITY

00:28:31.643 --> 00:28:33.144
OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:28:33.211 --> 00:28:35.480
ZONING IS SORT OF BORING BUT

00:28:35.547 --> 00:28:37.582
IT'S FOUNDATIONAL IT IS A MATH

00:28:37.649 --> 00:28:40.185
EQUATION IT SETS A BASELINE

00:28:40.251 --> 00:28:42.921
ABOUT HOW MUCH HOUSING IS LEGAL

00:28:42.987 --> 00:28:45.623
TO BUILD. YOU CAN HAVE THE MOST

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:47.459
STREAMLINED PROCESS IN THE

00:28:47.525 --> 00:28:49.494
WORLD YOU CAN HAVE ENORMOUS

00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:50.462
FIVE OF FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE

00:28:50.528 --> 00:28:52.564
HOUSING BUT IF THE ZONING SAYS

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:53.565
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO BUILD

00:28:53.631 --> 00:28:56.000
SOMETHING. THAT THE END OF THE

00:28:56.067 --> 00:28:58.470
PROCESS. RESTRICTIVE ZONING

00:28:58.536 --> 00:29:01.773
PUTS A HARD CAP FULL STOP WHEN

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.809
OUR ABILITY TO BUILD ENOUGH

00:29:04.876 --> 00:29:05.343
HOUSING TO GET OUT OF THIS

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:08.046
CRISIS. RESTRICTIVE ZONING ALSO

00:29:08.113 --> 00:29:10.248
LEADS TO SPRAWL. BROUGHT

00:29:10.315 --> 00:29:11.282
BECAUSE IF YOU CAN'T BUILD

00:29:11.349 --> 00:29:12.517
WHERE THE JOBS IN THE TRANSIT

00:29:12.584 --> 00:29:13.852
ARE YOU JUST GOING TO BUILD

00:29:13.918 --> 00:29:16.020
FURTHER AND FURTHER OUT. IT

00:29:16.087 --> 00:29:17.589
DESTROYS FARM LANDS AND OPEN

00:29:17.655 --> 00:29:20.758
SPACE. IT CLOGS ARE FREEWAYS TO

00:29:20.825 --> 00:29:22.193
THE POINT WHERE THEY BECOME

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:24.496
INCAPACITATED. IT PUSHES OUR%

00:29:24.562 --> 00:29:26.631
NEIGHBORS INTO MULTI HOUR

00:29:26.698 --> 00:29:27.665
COMMUTES WHERE PEOPLE ARE

00:29:27.732 --> 00:29:29.367
SPENDING THREE OR FOUR OR MORE

00:29:29.434 --> 00:29:31.970
HOURS A DAY. ON THE ROAD IT

00:29:32.036 --> 00:29:33.805
INCREASES CARBON EMISSIONS AND

00:29:33.872 --> 00:29:35.673
MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE. FOR US TO

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:37.475
BE OUR CAR OUR CLIMATE GOALS.

00:29:37.542 --> 00:29:39.210
WE'RE CURRENTLYFALLING BEHIND

00:29:39.277 --> 00:29:40.145
ON OUR CLIMATE GOALS IN

00:29:40.211 --> 00:29:42.147
CALIFORNIA. PRECISELY BECAUSE

00:29:42.213 --> 00:29:43.982
WE ARE PUSHING PEOPLE INTO THE

00:29:44.048 --> 00:29:47.118
SUPER COMMUTES BECAUSE WE DON'T

00:29:47.185 --> 00:29:47.819
BUILD ENOUGH HOUSING WHERE THE

00:29:47.886 --> 00:29:50.722
JOBS ARE. RESTRICTED TWENTY

00:29:50.788 --> 00:29:51.623
INCH IS THAT HOW. IS

00:29:51.689 --> 00:29:54.759
PERPETUALLY EXPENSIVE AND OUT

00:29:54.826 --> 00:29:56.961
OF REACH FOR MOST CALIFORNIANS.

00:29:57.028 --> 00:29:58.496
SB FIFTY WILL HELP CALIFORNIA

00:29:58.563 --> 00:30:00.098
CLOSE ITS MASS THAT MASSIVE

00:30:00.165 --> 00:30:02.734
HOUSING DEFICIT AND DO SO IN A

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.536
WAY THAT DOESN'T CREATE SPRAWL

00:30:04.602 --> 00:30:07.138
THAT IS SUSTAINABLE. SO HOW DO

00:30:07.205 --> 00:30:09.040
WE GET TO THIS POINT WHERE WE

00:30:09.107 --> 00:30:10.475
HAVE A MULTI MILLION HOME

00:30:10.542 --> 00:30:12.243
DEFICIT AND WE ARE BASICALLY

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:15.213
BOTTOM OF THE BARREL AMONG THE

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:15.880
FIFTY STATES IN OUR HOUSING

00:30:15.947 --> 00:30:18.016
SUPPLY. IT DIDN'T JUST HAPPEN

00:30:18.082 --> 00:30:20.351
RANDOMLY IT HAPPENED BECAUSE OF

00:30:20.418 --> 00:30:22.420
DELIBERATE ANTI HOUSING POLICY

00:30:22.487 --> 00:30:24.289
CHOICES THE CALIFORNIA AND OUR

00:30:24.355 --> 00:30:26.391
CITIES HAVE MADE OVER THE LAST

00:30:26.457 --> 00:30:27.392
FIFTY YEARS WE HAVE

00:30:27.458 --> 00:30:29.727
SYSTEMATICALLY DE PRIORITIZE

00:30:29.794 --> 00:30:31.863
HOUSING. AND WE HAD A AT IN IN

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:33.331
IN A FACT A POLICY IN

00:30:33.398 --> 00:30:34.933
CALIFORNIA THAT IS NOT A

00:30:34.999 --> 00:30:38.169
PRIORITY TO HAVE ENOUGH HOUSING

00:30:38.236 --> 00:30:39.971
FOR EVERYONE WHO NEEDS A- WE'VE

00:30:40.038 --> 00:30:42.173
MADE A CHOICE. THAT THE WAY A

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:45.710
NEIGHBORHOOD LOOKS. THAT VIEWS

00:30:45.777 --> 00:30:47.879
ARE MORE IMPORTANT TO WHOSE

00:30:47.946 --> 00:30:49.280
ACTUALLY ABLE THEN WHO'S

00:30:49.347 --> 00:30:50.882
ACTUALLY ABLE TO LIVE IN A

00:30:50.949 --> 00:30:54.752
NEIGHBORHOOD. NOW FOR THE FIRST

00:30:54.819 --> 00:30:56.387
HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS

00:30:56.454 --> 00:30:58.523
CALIFORNIA EXISTED WE DIDN'T DO

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:00.525
IT THIS WAY WE LET PEOPLE BUILD

00:31:00.592 --> 00:31:02.293
APARTMENT BUILDINGS ALL OVER

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.028
THE PLACE AND THAT'S WHY WE

00:31:04.095 --> 00:31:06.030
BUILT SO MUCH HOUSING IN THE

00:31:06.097 --> 00:31:07.599
FIFTIES AND THE SIXTIES

00:31:07.665 --> 00:31:09.667
SEVENTIES FORTIES WHEN WE WERE

00:31:09.734 --> 00:31:11.135
GROWING BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS. WE

00:31:11.202 --> 00:31:12.770
SAID BUILD SINGLE FAMILY HOMES

00:31:12.837 --> 00:31:14.038
BUT ALSO BUILD APARTMENT

00:31:14.105 --> 00:31:15.940
BUILDINGS AND SO WE KEPT UP

00:31:16.007 --> 00:31:18.142
WITH POPULATION GROWTH WE USED

00:31:18.209 --> 00:31:19.978
TO BUILD AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT

00:31:20.044 --> 00:31:21.579
MORE HOUSING THAN WE DO TODAY

00:31:21.646 --> 00:31:22.981
WHEN WE WERE SMALLER STATE

00:31:23.047 --> 00:31:23.781
BECAUSE WE DID IT THE OLD

00:31:23.848 --> 00:31:25.583
FASHIONED WAY. WE BILL ENOUGH

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:26.985
HOUSING TO ACCOMMODATE OUR

00:31:27.051 --> 00:31:30.421
GROWTH. AND THEN WE STOP DOING

00:31:30.488 --> 00:31:31.089
THAT IN THE SEVENTIES AND

00:31:31.155 --> 00:31:32.690
EIGHTIES SAN FRANCISCO DOWN

00:31:32.757 --> 00:31:35.059
ZONES. AND ELIMINATED THE

00:31:35.126 --> 00:31:36.194
ABILITY TO HAVE APARTMENT

00:31:36.261 --> 00:31:38.062
BUILDINGS AND 70% OF THE CITY

00:31:38.129 --> 00:31:41.165
LA DID IN THE EIGHTIES. AND 75%

00:31:41.232 --> 00:31:42.600
OF THE CITY. AND WE

00:31:42.667 --> 00:31:44.335
SYSTEMATICALLY DECIDED WE'RE NO

00:31:44.402 --> 00:31:46.571
LONGER GOING TO ALLOW ENOUGH

00:31:46.638 --> 00:31:47.939
HOUSING FOR THE PEOPLE THAT DID

00:31:48.006 --> 00:31:50.475
IT. OTHER CITIES AND SUBURBS

00:31:50.541 --> 00:31:52.977
QUICKLY FOLLOWED SUIT. THIS HAS

00:31:53.044 --> 00:31:55.413
HAD PROFOUND CONSEQUENCES FOR

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:56.914
OUR ECONOMY FOR OUR

00:31:56.981 --> 00:31:58.483
ENVIRONMENT. FOR PEOPLE'S

00:31:58.549 --> 00:32:00.385
QUALITY OF LIFE AND FOR THE

00:32:00.451 --> 00:32:03.021
DIVERSITY OF OUR COMMUNITIES IT

00:32:03.087 --> 00:32:03.488
HAS PUT A FUNDAMENTAL

00:32:03.554 --> 00:32:05.556
IMPEDIMENT. IN CALIFORNIA'S

00:32:05.623 --> 00:32:07.625
ABILITY TO BE A PLACE WHERE

00:32:07.692 --> 00:32:08.960
PEOPLE CAN COME HERE AND MAKE

00:32:09.027 --> 00:32:10.962
LIVES FOR THEMSELVES. WHERE

00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:13.097
YOUNG PEOPLE CAN BE A PART OF

00:32:13.164 --> 00:32:15.333
OUR COMMUNITY AND HAVE HOPE

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.702
THAT THEY WILL HAVE A FUTURE.

00:32:17.769 --> 00:32:18.703
AND THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:20.738
AS A STATE THAT IS CREATIVE AND

00:32:20.805 --> 00:32:23.107
DIVERSE AND INNOVATIVE DOT IS A

00:32:23.174 --> 00:32:24.309
THREAT BECAUSE WE HAVE DE

00:32:24.375 --> 00:32:26.711
PRIORITIZE HOUSIN. SO

00:32:26.778 --> 00:32:29.714
SIGNIFICANTLY SB FIFTY ALL IT

00:32:29.781 --> 00:32:33.251
DOES IS READ LEGAL OFFICE.

00:32:33.318 --> 00:32:34.886

SIZE APARTMENT BUILDINGS IN

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.255
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IT REALLY

00:32:37.322 --> 00:32:38.856
LIES IS ON AND MANY OF THE

00:32:38.923 --> 00:32:41.993
PLACES. WHERE THEY WERE LEGAL

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:42.527
FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY YEARS

00:32:42.593 --> 00:32:44.128
BEFORE WE BEGAN ON. THIS IS

00:32:44.195 --> 00:32:46.464
NOTHING NEW WE'RE JUST SAYING

00:32:46.531 --> 00:32:48.032
LET'S GO BACK TO THE ERA WHEN

00:32:48.099 --> 00:32:49.667
WE ACTUALLY WERE BUILDING A

00:32:49.734 --> 00:32:53.604
HOUSING FOR PEOPLE. NOW I WANT

00:32:53.671 --> 00:32:54.238
TO BE CLEAR ABOUT SB FIT DOES

00:32:54.305 --> 00:32:55.473
WHAT IT DOSN'T DO. THERE'S

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:57.408

THERE'S BEEN TALK THAT THIS IS

00:33:20.298 --> 00:33:21.332

EVEN MORE AND MAKE SURE IT IS

00:34:53.257 --> 00:34:55.593
IT'S EASY TO USE AS POSSIBLE

00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:57.695

URGE AN AYE VOTE TODAY BECAUSE

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:41.071

SENATE. IT IS ALSO ONE WHERE

00:40:54.151 --> 00:40:54.852
THERE'S BEEN TREMENDOUS

00:40:54.919 --> 00:40:57.154
DIFFERENCE OF OPINION BETWEEN

00:40:57.221 --> 00:40:58.155

HEREON THE FLOOR TODAY FROM

00:41:56.714 --> 00:41:58.349
OUR OWN COMMUNITIES. THERE ARE

00:41:58.415 --> 00:42:00.651
COMPELLING REASONS WHY WE NEED

00:42:00.718 --> 00:42:02.953
TO ADDRESS THIS DEEP AND URGENT

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:05.556
CRISIS. A CRISIS FOR PEOPLE

00:42:05.623 --> 00:42:07.625
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS FOR

00:42:07.691 --> 00:42:09.159
FAMILIES STRUGGLING TO KEEP A

00:42:09.226 --> 00:42:11.528
ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS. AND FOR

00:42:11.595 --> 00:42:12.897
NEIGHBORHOODS UNRAVELED IN THE

00:42:12.963 --> 00:42:15.599
FACE OF DESPERATION REAL PEOPLE

00:42:15.666 --> 00:42:17.935
REAL IMPACTS ON THEIR LIVES AND

00:42:18.002 --> 00:42:20.638
THEIR HOPES AND THEIR DREAMS

00:42:20.704 --> 00:42:22.006
AND THEIR OPPORTUNITIES. BUT

00:42:22.072 --> 00:42:24.108
THE THESIS OF MY COMMENTS TODAY

00:42:24.174 --> 00:42:26.043
ON THIS FLOOR. COMES DOWN TO

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:30.080
THIS GETTING IT RIGHT IS JUST

00:42:30.147 --> 00:42:32.816
AS URGENT GETTING IT RIGHT IS

00:42:32.883 --> 00:42:35.686
JUST AS URGENT TOO OFTEN. ALL

00:42:35.753 --> 00:42:39.690
OF US BID ARE CONSUMED BY THE

00:42:39.757 --> 00:42:42.126
IMMEDIATE ISSUE AT HAND AND WE

00:42:42.192 --> 00:42:43.394
BIND OURSELVES TO THE

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:46.230
UNFORGIVING LAW OF UNINTENDED

00:42:46.297 --> 00:42:49.033
CONSEQUENCES. WELL I HAVE BEEN

00:42:49.099 --> 00:42:49.800
DOING A GREAT DEAL OF THINKING

00:42:49.867 --> 00:42:51.335
ON THIS ISSUE TYPICALLY

00:42:51.402 --> 00:42:53.370
RELATING TO AFFORDABILITY I

00:42:53.437 --> 00:42:55.272
WILL LIMIT MY COMMENTS TODAY

00:42:55.339 --> 00:42:56.373
THE THREE IMPORTANT POINTS.

00:42:56.440 --> 00:43:00.511
FIRST THE PREMISE OF THIS BILL

00:43:00.577 --> 00:43:02.313
IS THAT MAYORS AND CITY COUNCIL

00:43:02.379 --> 00:43:04.148
MEMBERS OF SOME OF OUR FOUR

00:43:04.214 --> 00:43:05.716
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO CITIES

00:43:05.783 --> 00:43:07.584
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE

00:43:07.651 --> 00:43:08.686
STANDING IN THE WAY OF

00:43:08.752 --> 00:43:10.654
HOMEBUILDING AT THE BEHEST OF

00:43:10.721 --> 00:43:13.624
SINGLE FAMILY. HOMEOWNERS WELL

00:43:13.691 --> 00:43:15.926
THERE MAY BE SOME MERIT TO THIS

00:43:15.993 --> 00:43:16.327
NOTION IN LIMITED

00:43:16.393 --> 00:43:18.462
CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS SWEEPING

00:43:18.529 --> 00:43:20.597
GENERALIZATION BOTH IT OVER

00:43:20.664 --> 00:43:22.366
SIMPLIFIES THE PROBLEM. AN

00:43:22.433 --> 00:43:24.601
UNNECESSARILY DEMEANS PEOPLE

00:43:24.668 --> 00:43:25.936
WHO WITH NOTHING DONE NOTHING

00:43:26.003 --> 00:43:27.571
MORE THAN MAKE HOMES FOR

00:43:27.638 --> 00:43:30.474
THEMSELVES RAISE A FAMILY AND

00:43:30.541 --> 00:43:33.444
PLAY BY THE RULES. AND NOW THIS

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:35.045
MEASURE AND I JUST TALKED TO

00:43:35.112 --> 00:43:37.147
THE CITY TO CONFIRM THIS SEEKS

00:43:37.214 --> 00:43:38.682
TO IMPOSE NEW RULES FOR

00:43:38.749 --> 00:43:41.485
NEIGHBORHOODS IN NEARLY 80% OF

00:43:41.552 --> 00:43:44.855
LOS ANGELES. WE HAVE GIVEN

00:43:44.922 --> 00:43:46.857
THERE'S A CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS

00:43:46.924 --> 00:43:49.760
A FALSE CHOICE ON THE ONE HAND

00:43:49.827 --> 00:43:52.162
WE SAID HOUSING ELEMENTS SET

00:43:52.229 --> 00:43:54.331
HOUSING GOALS AND YET ON THE

00:43:54.398 --> 00:43:56.533
OTHER HANDAS THEY WORK TO

00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:00.471
PROVIDE POLICE FIRE AND OTHER

00:44:00.537 --> 00:44:01.005
IT'S ESSENTIAL SERVICES TO

00:44:01.071 --> 00:44:03.340
RESIDENTS. THEY HAVE BEEN CASH

00:44:03.407 --> 00:44:05.776
STARVED THE ONLY AVENUE

00:44:05.843 --> 00:44:07.845
AVAILABLE IN PRINCIPLE IS THE

00:44:07.911 --> 00:44:09.980
BRADLEY BURNS UNIFORM SALES TAX

00:44:10.047 --> 00:44:11.448
WHICH ALLOCATES ONE CENT FOR

00:44:11.515 --> 00:44:13.951
EACH DOLLAR OF SALES TO CITIES.

00:44:14.018 --> 00:44:15.486
THE REAL BUT UNINTENDED

00:44:15.552 --> 00:44:17.054
CONSEQUENCES WHICH TO GIVE A

00:44:17.121 --> 00:44:19.423
CITIES A REASON TO SAY YES TO

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:21.258
AUTO MALLS YES THE BIG BOX

00:44:21.325 --> 00:44:22.960
RETAIL STORES WHICH WOULD ADD

00:44:23.027 --> 00:44:24.695
CITY FUNDING BUT SAY NO TO

00:44:24.762 --> 00:44:26.397
HOUSING THE FISCAL IS ATION OF

00:44:26.463 --> 00:44:27.965
LAND USE WHICH WOULD INCREASE

00:44:28.032 --> 00:44:29.833
COSTS OF PROVIDING SERVICES.

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:31.735
THAT IS THE SIMPLE SPEECH

00:44:31.802 --> 00:44:34.471
BIGGEST REASON WE ARE WHERE WE

00:44:34.538 --> 00:44:37.041
ARE. SECOND THE GOVERNOR IN ALL

00:44:37.107 --> 00:44:39.009
OF US IN THIS CHAMBER. WANT TO

00:44:39.076 --> 00:44:40.744
BUILD HOUSING URGENCY URGENTLY

00:44:40.811 --> 00:44:42.946
THAT IS CLEAR. WE NEED TO START

00:44:43.013 --> 00:44:44.815
BUILDING THIS AFTERNOON IF YOU

00:44:44.882 --> 00:44:46.683
ASK FOLKS THAT WE REPRESENT.

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:47.985
BUT THIS BILL WILL NOT TAKE

00:44:48.052 --> 00:44:51.321
EFFECT UNTIL JANUARY TWENTY

00:44:51.388 --> 00:44:51.889
TWENTY ONE ABOUT A YEAR FROM

00:44:51.955 --> 00:44:54.058
NOW. AND THE AMENDMENTS TICKET

00:44:54.124 --> 00:44:55.859
JUST THREE WEEKS AGO THE LADY

00:44:55.926 --> 00:44:58.262
SP FIFTIES MAJOR PROVISIONS FOR

00:44:58.328 --> 00:44:59.696
MORE THAN TWO YEARS TO TWENTY

00:44:59.763 --> 00:45:01.231
TWENTY THREE. THE START OF THE

00:45:01.298 --> 00:45:04.535
GOVERNOR SECOND TERM. THAT'S

00:45:04.601 --> 00:45:06.303
THREE YEARS OF WAITING. NOT

00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:07.738
REALLY ADDRESSING THE URGENT

00:45:07.805 --> 00:45:09.606
PROBLEMS GETTING HOMES BUILT.

00:45:09.673 --> 00:45:11.175
EVEN BEFORE CONSIDERING DELAYS

00:45:11.241 --> 00:45:13.577
BASED UPON THE VERY REAL

00:45:13.644 --> 00:45:16.213
PROSPECT OF LITIGATION. SO WHAT

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:18.482
HAPPENS IN THE MEANTIME. WHAT

00:45:18.549 --> 00:45:21.385
HAPPENS IN THE REAL WORLD. FIVE

00:45:21.452 --> 00:45:22.419
A DEVELOPER CONTEMPLATING A

00:45:22.486 --> 00:45:24.855
PROJECT THIS BILL REGRETTABLY

00:45:24.922 --> 00:45:27.124
AND IRONICALLY HIS ME HUGE

INCENTIVE NOT BUILD NOW BUT

THIS MY HANDS FOR THE NEXT

00:45:31.595 --> 00:45:32.930

STORIES WOULD YOU CAN BILL FIVE

00:45:36.667 --> 00:45:37.134

WORSE TIME TO INADVERTENTLY

POUR SAND IN THE GEARS. WITH

00:45:42.739 --> 00:45:45.943
VOTER APPROVAL LOS ANGELES HAS

00:45:46.009 --> 00:45:47.578
INCREASED INCENTIVES FOR

00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:00.891
THAT THEY ARE CAUSING THE

00:46:00.958 --> 00:46:02.559
PROBLEM MANY ARE AT A RING

COMMUNITIES WAS BASED ON EIGHTY

00:46:40.664 --> 00:46:43.500
USE NOT BUILDING NEW STUFF BUT

00:46:43.567 --> 00:46:44.101
EIGHTY USE BECAUSE IT'S BEEN.

00:46:44.168 --> 00:46:47.905
SO WILDLY SUCCESSFUL. THIRD IN

THE PAST I KNOW THE ARGUMENT IS

00:46:49.973 --> 00:46:51.041
BEEN MADE HERE ON THE FLOOR BUT

I WANT TO STAND IN THE COUNTRY

00:46:52.809 --> 00:46:54.211
POSITION I HAVE STOOD ON THIS

00:46:54.278 --> 00:46:56.313
FLOOR. AND HUMBLY ASK MY

00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:58.415
COLLEAGUES MANY OF YOU. FOR THE

00:46:58.482 --> 00:46:59.783
COURTESY TO MOVE A MEASURE THAT

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:01.285
WAS NOT FULLY DEVELOPED TO THE

00:47:01.351 --> 00:47:02.186
OTHER HOUSE AS A WORK IN

00:47:02.252 --> 00:47:04.488
PROGRESS. A NUMBER OF US HAVE

00:47:04.555 --> 00:47:06.790
DONE SO OURSELVES. BUT I WOULD

00:47:06.857 --> 00:47:08.325
SUGGEST THAT THIS TIME WE'RE IN

00:47:08.392 --> 00:47:10.260
A DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES. AS I

00:47:10.327 --> 00:47:11.461
MENTIONED EVEN IN THE BEST

ARE STILL IN THE OPENING DAYS

00:47:19.236 --> 00:47:21.138
OF THIS YEAR. THIS BILL MAKES

00:47:21.205 --> 00:47:23.740
SWEEPING CHANGES TO HUGE SWATHS

00:47:23.807 --> 00:47:25.809
OF THE STATE. THERE IS NO

00:47:25.876 --> 00:47:28.712
REASON IN MY JUDGMENT THE POINT.

00:47:28.779 --> 00:47:30.447
APPS THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE

00:47:30.514 --> 00:47:31.982
IS THE PRO TEM SAID THAT WE

00:47:32.049 --> 00:47:34.151
FACE TO THE OTHER HOUSE DENYING

00:47:34.218 --> 00:47:35.452
OURSELVES AN OPPORTUNITY TO

00:47:35.519 --> 00:47:37.621
COLLECTIVELY DO THE WORK AND

00:47:37.688 --> 00:47:38.622
EFFECTIVELY AND URGENTLY

00:47:38.689 --> 00:47:40.591
ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. LET'S DO

00:47:40.657 --> 00:47:42.226
THE HOMEWORK TOGETHER LET'S

00:47:42.292 --> 00:47:43.961
BUILD ON THE EXTRAORDINARY

00:47:44.027 --> 00:47:45.562
HOMEWORK THAT THE AUTHOR OF

00:47:45.629 --> 00:47:47.097
THIS MEASURE HAS DONE IN ALL

00:47:47.164 --> 00:47:48.265
CORNERS OF THE STATE OF

00:47:48.332 --> 00:47:50.133

MY DE FOR MANY YEARS AND I'VE

00:48:59.236 --> 00:49:01.972

00:49:02.039 --> 00:49:03.573
THOUSAND UNITS IN MY DISTRICT

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:05.275
SOME THAT ARE VERY PROUD OF

00:49:07.411 --> 00:49:09.313
HIGH QUALITY AFFORDABLE HOUSING

EFFORT. AND RIGHT NOW THAT WE

HAVE A RENT PRICES HAVE NEVER

THROUGH THESE EXORBITANT RENT.

00:49:27.698 --> 00:49:30.934
PRICES THAT THAT ARE JUST

00:49:31.001 --> 00:49:33.403
UNBELIEVABLE I DON'T KNOW HOW

00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:33.970
PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO LIVE IN

00:49:34.037 --> 00:49:37.774
OUR STATE. I CAN'T EXPLAIN WHY

00:49:37.841 --> 00:49:39.876
WE DON'T HAVE A GREATER SUPPLY

00:49:39.943 --> 00:49:41.278
OF APARTMENTS UNDER

00:49:41.345 --> 00:49:43.714
CONSTRUCTION. AND AS I'VE GONE

00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:45.782

WITH RENT PRICES AT THIS RATE.

00:49:50.654 --> 00:49:52.189
WHY ARE YOU BUILDING MORE AND

00:49:52.255 --> 00:49:55.025
THE PRIMARY RESPONSE FROM THEM

00:49:55.092 --> 00:49:58.362
IS WHERE. WHERE CAN WE BUILD

00:49:58.428 --> 00:50:01.765
WHERE DOES OWNING ALLOW US TO.

00:50:01.832 --> 00:50:05.602
BUILD UNITS THAT WE CAN- TURN A

00:50:05.669 --> 00:50:07.437
PROFIT IN EVEN EVEN AT THESE

00:50:07.504 --> 00:50:09.306
EXORBITANT RENT RATES AND

00:50:09.373 --> 00:50:11.475

00:50:12.876 --> 00:50:14.644
INVOLVED IN IN IN THIS MAN FOR

00:50:14.711 --> 00:50:16.880
MANY YEARS. AND SEEING A BILL

00:50:16.947 --> 00:50:18.415
LIKE THIS SINCE YOU KNOW HOW

00:50:18.482 --> 00:50:19.316
THIS BILL IS GOING TO AFFECT MY

00:50:19.383 --> 00:50:21.017
DISTRICT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN

00:50:21.084 --> 00:50:22.652
THIS IS THIS IS. THIS BILL

00:50:22.719 --> 00:50:23.954
FOLLOW SOME VERY BASIC

00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:25.655
PRINCIPLES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:50:25.722 --> 00:50:28.125
SMART GROWTH. INTRODUCING

00:50:28.191 --> 00:50:29.393
HOUSING WHERE YOU HAVE MASS

00:50:29.459 --> 00:50:31.261
TRANSIT THAT MAKES AN ENORMOUS

00:50:31.328 --> 00:50:34.264
AMOUNT OF SENSE. I LOOKED AT

00:50:34.331 --> 00:50:36.099
THIS BILL IT JUST MAKES A- A

00:50:36.166 --> 00:50:37.868
NORMS NONSENSE TO ME AS PEOPLE

00:50:37.934 --> 00:50:39.536
SAY IT THIS IS GOOD ELIMINATE

00:50:39.603 --> 00:50:41.204
RESIDENTIAL ZONING AND I LOOK

00:50:41.271 --> 00:50:44.841
AT THE ZONING. THAT'S CLOSE TO.

00:50:44.908 --> 00:50:47.244
TO A MASS TRANSIT WE REALLY

00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:50.747
DON'T HAVE A LOT OF SINGLE

00:50:50.814 --> 00:50:54.217
FAMILY RESIDENCE CLOSE TREND

00:50:54.284 --> 00:50:55.552
I'M HOPING AS FOR AS FAR AS MY

00:50:55.619 --> 00:50:57.053
OCCUR COMING. CAN ONE OF THE

00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:59.389
REASONS SEVEN MAINLY GOT ME OUT

00:50:59.456 --> 00:51:01.391
TO RUN FOR OFFICE. WAS AN

00:51:01.458 --> 00:51:02.526
EXPERIENCE THAT I HAD IN MY

00:51:02.592 --> 00:51:04.728
COMMUNITY AND MAYBE YOU'VE HAD

00:51:04.795 --> 00:51:06.496
THE SAME EXPERIENCE. THE

00:51:06.563 --> 00:51:07.731
COMMUNITY THAT I LIVE IN

00:51:07.798 --> 00:51:09.132
SOUTHEAST SAN DIEGO HAD A

00:51:09.199 --> 00:51:11.535
COMMUNITY PLAN THAT WAS UPDATED

00:51:11.601 --> 00:51:14.104
IN NINETEEN. EIGHTY SEVEN. ANY

00:51:14.171 --> 00:51:16.373
RESPONSE TO HIGH CRIME RATES-

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:18.442
THE LEADERS OF THE CITY AT THAT

00:51:18.508 --> 00:51:20.610
TIME DECIDED TO DOWN ZONE. SO A

00:51:20.677 --> 00:51:22.245
LOT OF RESIDENTIAL ZONING THAT

00:51:22.312 --> 00:51:25.816
WAS THAT ALLOWED SIX UNITS. WAS

00:51:25.882 --> 00:51:29.386
DOWN ZONE TO TWO UNITS NOT TALK

00:51:29.453 --> 00:51:31.655
ABOUT MOVIE IN. THE MOVING THE

00:51:31.721 --> 00:51:33.023
GOAL POST DURING THE

00:51:33.089 --> 00:51:34.958
COMPETITION. HERE ARE

00:51:35.025 --> 00:51:37.527
INDIVIDUALS THAT PAID A PREMIUM

00:51:37.594 --> 00:51:40.330
FOR. THE RESIDENTIAL LEASE ON

00:51:40.397 --> 00:51:41.798
LAND THAT WAS THAT ALLOWED SIX

00:51:41.865 --> 00:51:45.435
UNITS. AND IT WAS DOWNS OF THE

00:51:45.502 --> 00:51:47.337
TWO UNITS THAT'S LIKE TAKING

00:51:47.404 --> 00:51:49.139
MONEY OUT OF PEOPLE'S POCKETS

00:51:49.206 --> 00:51:51.274
AND WHAT IT REALLY RESULTED IN

00:51:51.341 --> 00:51:53.443
HIS BLOOD OF PEOPLE NOT TEARING

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:55.612
DOWN OF UNITS WHERE THEY HAD

00:51:55.679 --> 00:51:56.980
FOUR UNITS ALREADY BECAUSE THEY

00:51:57.047 --> 00:51:58.815
COULD ONLY BE REBUILT TWO UNITS

00:51:58.882 --> 00:52:01.218
AND IF THEY HAD SIX UNITS SO

00:52:01.284 --> 00:52:04.788
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF- UNITS IN MY

00:52:04.855 --> 00:52:05.856
NEIGHBORHOOD. THE AMERICAN

00:52:05.922 --> 00:52:08.325
REPLACE I CAN'T REPLACE A DOES

00:52:08.391 --> 00:52:09.860
MAKE FINANCIAL SENSE REPLACE

00:52:09.926 --> 00:52:11.628
AND SO WE HAVE A LOT OF THE

00:52:11.695 --> 00:52:14.331
UPDATED UNITS THAT PEOPLE. WANT

00:52:14.397 --> 00:52:16.967
TO REINVENT AND BECAUSE THEY

00:52:17.033 --> 00:52:18.969
CAN REBUILD. AND I THINK I THE

00:52:19.035 --> 00:52:20.704
REASON I'M I'M- RAISING THIS IS

00:52:20.770 --> 00:52:21.872
AN ISSUE BECAUSE YOU PROBABLY

00:52:21.938 --> 00:52:24.674
HAD. THAT SAME EXPERIENCE IN

00:52:24.741 --> 00:52:26.443
YOUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE WHAT

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:28.411
HAPPENED IN THOSE YEARS IN THE

00:52:28.478 --> 00:52:29.679
ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:52:29.746 --> 00:52:31.581
SINCE THEN. THERE'S BEEN A LOT

00:52:31.648 --> 00:52:33.850
OF DOWN ZONING THAT'S OCCURRED

00:52:33.917 --> 00:52:36.486
SINCE THEN. SO IF YOU CONSIDER

00:52:36.553 --> 00:52:38.355
THAT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN.

00:52:38.421 --> 00:52:41.291
THE POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA

00:52:41.358 --> 00:52:43.593
WAS TWENTY EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE.

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:45.328
AND TODAY WE HAVE FORTY MILLION

00:52:45.395 --> 00:52:47.731
PEOPLE IN IN THAT PERIOD WE'VE

00:52:47.797 --> 00:52:49.799
SEEN A LOT OF A DOWN ZONING

00:52:49.866 --> 00:52:52.636
TAKE PLACE. IF YOU IF YOU KNOW

00:52:52.702 --> 00:52:54.638
MATH IT'S A VERY SIMPLE ISSUE

00:52:54.704 --> 00:52:57.641
THIS IS AN ISSUE OF SUPPLY AND

00:52:57.707 --> 00:52:59.776
DEMAND AND IF WE'VE LOWERED.

00:52:59.843 --> 00:53:01.444
THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE THAT

00:53:01.511 --> 00:53:04.180
SUPPLY WE ONLY HAVE DEMAND

00:53:04.247 --> 00:53:13.089
INCREASING. AND NO ABILITY. TO

00:53:13.156 --> 00:53:17.160
PROBLEM THIS BILL DOESN'T GET

00:53:17.227 --> 00:53:19.396
TO THE PRIMARY ISSUE WHAT IT'S

00:53:19.462 --> 00:53:21.031
GOING TO HELP IT'S GOING TO

00:53:21.097 --> 00:53:22.599
HELP IS IT GONNA DESTROY

00:53:22.666 --> 00:53:24.467
RESIDENTIAL ZONING AS SOME

00:53:24.534 --> 00:53:26.603
CLAIM NO IS IT GONNA GO AS FAR

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:28.672
AS SOME PEOPLE FEAR IT MIGHT

00:53:28.738 --> 00:53:30.807
ABSOLUTELY NOT BUT WILL IT MAKE

00:53:30.874 --> 00:53:33.109
A DIFFERENCE ABSOLUTELY YES. IT

00:53:33.176 --> 00:53:36.513
WILL. AND I THINK TALK IS CHEAP

00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:38.014
AS LONG AS I'VE BEEN HERE WE'VE

00:53:38.081 --> 00:53:39.783
BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE

00:53:39.849 --> 00:53:42.385
WE'VE MADE SOME GAINS. WE'VE

00:53:42.452 --> 00:53:44.187
MADE SOME GAINS WE HAVE FUNDED

00:53:44.254 --> 00:53:46.656
OF SOME FOR HOUSING BUT AS FAR

00:53:46.723 --> 00:53:49.693
IS REALLY ADDRESSING THE SUPPLY

00:53:49.759 --> 00:53:51.528
ISSUE WE HAVE NOT DONE THAT.

00:53:51.595 --> 00:53:53.229
AND AS OUR GOVERNOR COMES IN

00:53:53.296 --> 00:53:56.099
MAKING SOME PROMISES TO BUILD

00:53:56.166 --> 00:53:58.768
SEVERAL MILLION UNITS. I DON'T

00:53:58.835 --> 00:53:59.703
KNOW HOW WE'RE GONNA DO THAT

00:53:59.769 --> 00:54:01.137
UNDER THE CURRENT SITUATION IN

00:54:01.204 --> 00:54:03.473
CALIFORNIA THIS BILL WILL AT

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:06.076
LEAST PROVIDE SOME ABILITY TO

00:54:06.142 --> 00:54:07.811
DELIVER ON THAT PROMISE IT'LL

00:54:07.877 --> 00:54:10.113
PROVIDE SOME ABILITY OF THIS

00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:12.082
LEGISLATURE. TO PRO PROVIDE

00:54:12.148 --> 00:54:13.984
MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WE

00:54:14.050 --> 00:54:15.585
CAN CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT

00:54:15.652 --> 00:54:17.420
SUPPLEMENT TEAM THAT WITH WITH

00:54:17.487 --> 00:54:19.723
MORE FUNDING. AND SUPPORT FOR

00:54:19.789 --> 00:54:21.858
THE LOCAL CITIES TO DO THAT BUT

00:54:21.925 --> 00:54:23.727
THE POLITICAL WILL- THAT'S NOT

00:54:23.793 --> 00:54:25.528
EXIST AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IS NOT

00:54:25.595 --> 00:54:27.998
ENOUGH TO CHANGE WHAT THE

00:54:28.064 --> 00:54:29.966
NUMBERS ON THE SUPPLIES SO. I

00:54:30.033 --> 00:54:31.201
ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS

00:54:31.267 --> 00:54:34.037
MEASURE. AND TO KEEP THE

00:54:34.104 --> 00:54:35.905
CONVERSATION GOING. THERE'S NO

00:54:35.972 --> 00:54:37.841
REASON WHY WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO

00:54:37.907 --> 00:54:38.875
TALK ABOUT THIS IN THE

00:54:38.942 --> 00:54:40.610
LEGISLATURE AND LET'S KEEP THIS

00:54:40.677 --> 00:54:42.512
BILL ALIVE SO WE CAN DO THAT

00:54:42.579 --> 00:54:43.913
THANK YOU MEMBERS. SENATOR

THROUGHOUT THIS DEBATE. A FAIR

00:54:55.625 --> 00:54:58.561
AMOUNT OF UNITY ON ON ONE FACT

00:54:58.628 --> 00:55:00.597
THAT WE ARE IN A CRISIS ONE OF

00:55:00.664 --> 00:55:03.133
HOMELESSNESS ONE A HOUSING IN

00:55:03.199 --> 00:55:05.502
THE STATE. AND I WOULD ADD A

00:55:05.568 --> 00:55:07.170
THIRD WHICH IS THE CLIMATE

00:55:07.237 --> 00:55:11.274
EMERGENCY. NOW SOME OF THE

00:55:11.341 --> 00:55:13.910
ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY. HAVE

00:55:13.977 --> 00:55:15.912
SPOKEN UP IN FAVOR THIS MEASURE

00:55:15.979 --> 00:55:17.647
AS I HAVE THROUGHOUT MY CAREER

00:55:17.714 --> 00:55:20.617
IN FACT THAT WE NEED MORE

00:55:20.684 --> 00:55:22.886
HOUSING NEAR TRANSIT TO REDUCE

00:55:22.952 --> 00:55:24.054
THE AMOUNT PEOPLE DRIVE SO WE

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:25.555
CAN REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF PATROL

00:55:25.622 --> 00:55:27.924
AND WE USE THAT WE CAN REDUCE

00:55:27.991 --> 00:55:28.525
THE AMOUNT OF POLLUTION IN THE

00:55:28.591 --> 00:55:30.326
STATE. AND I AGREE WITH THAT

00:55:30.393 --> 00:55:34.064
PREMISE I ALSO AGREE THAT WE DO

00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:36.900
NEED TO BUILD MORE. BUT I DO

00:55:36.966 --> 00:55:40.370
NOT BELIEVE. THAT IN ORDER TO

00:55:40.437 --> 00:55:40.937
MEET THE CHALLENGES OF THOSE

00:55:41.004 --> 00:55:43.606
CRISES. THAT WE HAVE TO CREATE

00:55:43.673 --> 00:55:50.280
NEW ONES. AND. YOU CAN ONLY

00:55:50.346 --> 00:55:53.349
LOOK BACK TO LAST FALL. AND

00:55:53.416 --> 00:55:56.052
THROUGHOUT THESE LAST YEAR'S.

00:55:56.119 --> 00:55:57.420
WHERE WILDFIRES HAVE TORN

00:55:57.487 --> 00:56:03.159
THROUGH. NOT THE HINTERLANDS.

00:56:03.226 --> 00:56:07.230
BUT A NEW CLASS OF NEIGHBORHOOD.

00:56:07.297 --> 00:56:08.898
EXTENDING DEEPER INTO OUR

00:56:08.965 --> 00:56:11.267
COMMUNITIES AND EVER BEFORE.

00:56:11.334 --> 00:56:14.304
THEY CALL THIS THE WE- THE

00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:16.406
WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE AND

00:56:16.473 --> 00:56:17.974
THOSE OF YOU WHO HAD PEOPLE

00:56:18.041 --> 00:56:20.310
LOSE HOMES OR LOSE THEIR LIVES

00:56:20.376 --> 00:56:22.912
NO THESE AREAS NOW ALL TOO WELL.

00:56:22.979 --> 00:56:25.115
THEY LOOK BEAUTIFUL. AND

00:56:25.181 --> 00:56:28.485
THEY'RE ALSO DEADLY. AND IT'S

00:56:28.551 --> 00:56:30.553
TIME WE STOP DEVELOPING AS A

00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:32.756
STATE INTO THE WILD IN URBAN

00:56:32.822 --> 00:56:36.126
INTERFACE PERIOD. THERE IS NO

00:56:36.192 --> 00:56:37.761
LAW ON THE BOOKS RIGHT NOW IN

00:56:37.827 --> 00:56:39.629
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT

00:56:39.696 --> 00:56:41.765
LIMITS THAT HUNGER FOR GROWTH

00:56:41.831 --> 00:56:44.868
INTO THOSE REGIONS. AND WHAT

00:56:44.934 --> 00:56:46.336
WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING IS

00:56:46.402 --> 00:56:47.537
BURNING MORE AND MORE

00:56:47.604 --> 00:56:49.739
CALIFORNIANS HOMES DOWN THE

RED TAX OUR INSURANCE SYSTEM.

00:56:56.546 --> 00:56:57.881
WHERE TO PUT A DRAIN ON LOCAL

00:56:57.947 --> 00:57:00.049
GOVERNMENTS AND ULTIMATELY AS

00:57:00.116 --> 00:57:01.151
THE RECEIVERS UP HERE WE'RE

00:57:01.217 --> 00:57:03.119
GONNA END UP FOOTING THE BILL

00:57:03.186 --> 00:57:06.956
FOR TAXPAYERS IN CALIFORNIA. SO

00:57:07.023 --> 00:57:08.258
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A DEBATE ABOUT

00:57:08.324 --> 00:57:11.861
HOUSING TODAY. SO I WANT TO

00:57:11.928 --> 00:57:15.331
TELL YOU ABOUT ONE EXAMPLE.

00:57:15.398 --> 00:57:16.733
WHEN THE WALLS THE FIRE TORE

00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:18.701
THROUGH THE DISTRICT I

00:57:18.768 --> 00:57:22.939
REPRESENT THE PEOPLE I WORK FOR.

00:57:23.006 --> 00:57:23.540
BURNED A LOT OF PEOPLE I KNOWS

00:57:23.606 --> 00:57:27.310

00:57:27.377 --> 00:57:29.345
BURN A LOT OF MY FRIENDS DOWN.

00:57:29.412 --> 00:57:31.181
I CAN GET BACK ON MY FEET

00:57:31.247 --> 00:57:33.550
THOUGH. I GOT A FAMILY THAT. I

00:57:33.616 --> 00:57:37.420

00:57:38.988 --> 00:57:42.792

00:57:44.594 --> 00:57:47.564

00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:50.567
NOW IN CITIES ALL THROUGHOUT

00:57:50.633 --> 00:57:52.435

00:58:13.623 --> 00:58:16.793

AND THAT'S PART OF THIS SORT OF

00:59:53.957 --> 00:59:56.559
WORK IN PROGRESS VERSUS TRY TO

00:59:56.626 --> 00:59:57.860

01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:16.846
SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY.

01:00:16.913 --> 01:00:18.848
KNOWING THAT. I'M MAKING THE

01:00:18.915 --> 01:00:23.052
PROBLEM WORSE. NOW THERE HAVE

01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:24.454
BEEN EXEMPTIONS GRANTED IN THIS

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:26.956
LEGISLATION TO BE CLEAR. THOSE

01:00:27.023 --> 01:00:27.557
COMMUNITIES MAY NOT HAVE BEEN

01:00:27.623 --> 01:00:29.225
EXEMPTED BUT CERTAINLY

01:00:29.292 --> 01:00:31.127
COMMUNITIES LIVING IN COUNTIES

01:00:31.194 --> 01:00:32.595
UNDER SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND HAVE.

01:00:32.662 --> 01:00:36.733

SOME MODEST UP ZONING IN THOSE

01:00:48.778 --> 01:00:50.680

01:02:08.724 --> 01:02:09.826
CONSCIENCE MAKE THIS A BILL

01:02:09.892 --> 01:02:13.096
ABOUT. DEALS AND EXEMPTIONS I

01:02:13.162 --> 01:02:14.764
TRULY BELIEVE IN THE PURPOSE OF

01:02:14.831 --> 01:02:16.165
THE AUTHORS PUTTING FORTH HERE

01:02:16.232 --> 01:02:18.301
THAT WE ACTUALLY DO NEED. A

01:02:18.367 --> 01:02:20.136
HOUSING SOLUTION IN THE STATE.

01:02:20.203 --> 01:02:23.873
THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT ALL

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:26.309
THESE RISKS BUT- DOESN'T MAKE

01:02:26.375 --> 01:02:30.746
THE PROBLEM WORSE. I APPRECIATE

01:02:30.813 --> 01:02:34.350
ALL THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE.

01:02:34.417 --> 01:02:35.818
AND I RECOGNIZE THAT THE BILL

01:02:35.885 --> 01:02:37.019
MAKES IT OUT OF THIS HOUSE

01:02:37.086 --> 01:02:41.557
TODAY YES IT COULD CHANGE. BUT

01:02:41.624 --> 01:02:43.359
WE DO NOT HAVE TO EXACERBATE

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:44.994
THE CLIMATE CRISIS WHILE WE TRY

01:02:45.061 --> 01:02:47.997
TO SOLVE IT. THAT IS A FALSE

01:02:48.064 --> 01:02:51.467
CHOICE. I BELIEVE WE CAN GET

01:02:51.534 --> 01:02:54.370
THIS RIGHT. THE PUSH FOR

01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:57.373
GENEROSITY. NOT TO EMPOWER NAME

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:01.177
BE ISM. BUT TO SAY YES IN THE

01:03:01.244 --> 01:03:04.180
RIGHT BACKYARDS THE LAND HAS TO

01:03:04.247 --> 01:03:07.350
DICTATE THE USE. AND WHEN THE

01:03:07.416 --> 01:03:09.218
LAND IS TOO DANGEROUS WE HAVE

01:03:09.285 --> 01:03:12.355
GOT TO SAY NO. AND WHEN THE

01:03:12.421 --> 01:03:14.323
COMMUNITY IS RIGHT WE DO HAVE

01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:17.193
TO SAY YES SO I AM. READY TO

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:20.196
SAY YES BUT- WE'VE BEEN THROUGH

01:03:20.263 --> 01:03:23.566
TOO MUCH TRAUMA. TO FORCE THIS

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:25.168
ON THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN TORN

01:03:25.234 --> 01:03:28.304
DOWN. AT ALL THE COSTS THAT

01:03:28.371 --> 01:03:30.072
COME WITH IT HUMAN FISCAL AN

01:03:30.139 --> 01:03:33.576
OTHERWISE. SO I REGRETFULLY

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:34.177
RISE IN OPPOSITION IS MEASURE

01:03:34.243 --> 01:03:37.213
AND- SHE ATE ALL THE HARD WORK

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:44.554
DONE SO FAR. CENTER SKINNER.

HOUSING SHORTAGE WHILE ALONE IS

01:04:23.826 --> 01:04:28.064
NOT THE SOLE CAUSE OF OUR VERY

01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:30.866
HIGH COST OF HOUSING IT IS. I

01:04:30.933 --> 01:04:32.535

01:04:38.741 --> 01:04:40.243
GETS A SIMPLIFIED IN DIFFERENT

01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:44.580
AREAS ANY GETS AMPLIFIED IN OUR

01:04:44.647 --> 01:04:46.782
HIGH JOB GROWTH AREAS. AND

01:04:46.849 --> 01:04:48.618
THOSE SAME HIGH JOB GROWTH

01:04:48.684 --> 01:04:50.653
AREAS THAT HAVE NOT BUILT TO

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:53.222
HOUSING ARE THOSE AREAS WERE

01:04:53.289 --> 01:04:55.124
NOT ONLY IS THE HOUSING MOST

01:04:55.191 --> 01:04:57.260
EXPENSIVE BUT WHERE WE ARE

01:04:57.326 --> 01:05:00.429
SEEING THE MOST GENTRIFICATION.

01:05:00.496 --> 01:05:04.934
AND DISPLACEMENT. AND WHILE

01:05:05.001 --> 01:05:08.404
SUPPLY ALONE WILL NOT STOP THAT

01:05:08.471 --> 01:05:10.906
IT IS ESSENTIAL TO STOP IT IT

01:05:10.973 --> 01:05:15.111
MUST BE THE SUPPLY MUST BE

01:05:15.177 --> 01:05:18.180
ADDED TO STOP IT. NOW LET'S

01:05:18.247 --> 01:05:22.952
LOOK AT SOME REAL FAX THE ONLY

01:05:23.019 --> 01:05:26.756
PLACES IN THE U. S. WITH HIGH

01:05:26.822 --> 01:05:30.192
JOB GROWTH THAT HAVE ALSO SEEN

01:05:30.259 --> 01:05:33.929
HOUSING COSTS GO DOWN BOTH RENT

01:05:33.996 --> 01:05:35.898
AND HOMEOWNERSHIP ARE THOSE

01:05:35.965 --> 01:05:39.035
AREAS WHERE THE HOUSING SUPPLY

01:05:39.101 --> 01:05:41.404
INCREASED DRAMATICALLY. BUT

01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:44.106
WE'RE NOT THAT PLACE WE ARE NOT

01:05:44.173 --> 01:05:46.075
THAT PLACE WE HAVE NOT

01:05:46.142 --> 01:05:47.710
INCREASED OUR HOUSING SUPPLY

01:05:47.777 --> 01:05:50.212
DRAMATICALLY AND AS MY

01:05:50.279 --> 01:05:50.713
COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:53.382
POINTED OUT IF ANYTHING I DON'T

01:05:53.449 --> 01:05:55.451
MEAN ANYTHING WAS JUST HE SAID

01:05:55.518 --> 01:05:58.988
IT IT'S REAL. EVERYWHERE ACROSS

01:05:59.055 --> 01:06:02.792
OUR STATE. WE DOWN ZONED AND

01:06:02.858 --> 01:06:05.027
THAT'S SPEND FOR FORTY YEARS WE

01:06:05.094 --> 01:06:08.698
DOWN SOON. ENACT DOWN ZONING

01:06:08.764 --> 01:06:11.434
RESULTED IN EXCLUSIVE

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:14.470
NEIGHBORHOODS IT RESULTED IN

01:06:14.537 --> 01:06:16.772
THE SITUATION WHERE. THOSE

01:06:16.839 --> 01:06:18.140
NEIGHBORHOODS WITH THE BEST

01:06:18.207 --> 01:06:20.209
SCHOOLS THE BEST PARKS THE BEST

01:06:20.276 --> 01:06:24.146
AMENITIES. FEWER AND FEWER

01:06:24.213 --> 01:06:26.515
PEOPLE CAN LIVE NOW THERE'S

01:06:26.582 --> 01:06:28.551
LOTS OF OTHER REASONS THAT

01:06:28.617 --> 01:06:30.386
EXCLUSION HAPPENED LET'S NOT

01:06:30.453 --> 01:06:32.154
FOOL OURSELVES MUCH OF THAT

01:06:32.221 --> 01:06:35.291
DOWN ZONING STARTED AFTER THE

01:06:35.358 --> 01:06:37.360
FAIR HOUSING ACT. WENT INTO

01:06:37.426 --> 01:06:40.496
PLACE. AND SO YOU KNOW MUCH OF

01:06:40.563 --> 01:06:42.832
OUR ZONING LAWS WERE OUT RATE

01:06:42.898 --> 01:06:47.403
IN EXPLICITLY RACIST NOW. EVEN

01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:49.672
WITH THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT

01:06:49.739 --> 01:06:52.274
HAVE CONFRONTED THAT WE HAVE

01:06:52.341 --> 01:06:55.111
CHANGE SOME POLICIES BUT WE

01:06:55.177 --> 01:06:55.644
HAVE NOT CHANGED OUR CITY

01:06:55.711 --> 01:07:00.249
POLICIES. CAN'T WE ARE NOT ONLY

01:07:00.316 --> 01:07:01.984
THE SHORTAGE THE HOUSING

01:07:02.051 --> 01:07:04.720
SHORTAGE WE STILL HAVE THE

01:07:04.787 --> 01:07:09.091
EXTREME EXCLUSIVITY. WE HAVE

01:07:09.158 --> 01:07:10.126
NOT DONE ENOUGH YET BUT WE HAVE

01:07:10.192 --> 01:07:12.528
DONE A LOT AS A LEGISLATURE AND

01:07:12.595 --> 01:07:14.296
THE GOVERNOR SIGNED INTO LAW

01:07:14.363 --> 01:07:17.333
MANY PROTECTIONS FOR.

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:19.635
ESPECIALLY OUR TENANTS LAST

01:07:19.702 --> 01:07:21.170
YEAR'S BILL THAT PUT IN THE

01:07:21.237 --> 01:07:24.206
HOUSING THE RENTAL CAP LAST

01:07:24.273 --> 01:07:27.343
YEAR'S BILL THAT. HAD JUST

01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:29.478
BECAUSE EVICTION PROTECTIONS

01:07:29.545 --> 01:07:32.047
ACROSS THE STATE ARE THE

01:07:32.114 --> 01:07:33.816
INCREASE WE FUNDED FOR LEGAL

01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:36.886
SERVICES SO THOSE PEOPLE THAT

01:07:36.952 --> 01:07:39.088
WERE FACED WITH. I'M

01:07:39.155 --> 01:07:41.690
JUSTIFICATIONS OR UNFAIR OR

01:07:41.757 --> 01:07:43.626
WRONG RENT INCREASES ROY RAINY

01:07:43.692 --> 01:07:44.960
CREASES THAT DIDN'T COMPLY WITH

01:07:45.027 --> 01:07:46.896
THE LAW WOULD HAVE SOME ABILITY

01:07:46.962 --> 01:07:49.064
TO GET SOME LEGAL ASSISTANCE

01:07:49.131 --> 01:07:50.366
WE'VE ALSO DONE A LITTLE MORE

01:07:50.433 --> 01:07:53.202
PROTECTIONS AROUND PEOPLE FOR

01:07:53.269 --> 01:07:55.404
WHO MAY FACE FORECLOSURE. OR

01:07:55.471 --> 01:07:57.006
WHO MAY BE FACING ON FAIR

01:07:57.072 --> 01:07:59.308
LENDING PRACTICES NOT ENOUGH

01:07:59.375 --> 01:08:00.609
NOT ENOUGH WE'VE GOT TO DO MORE

01:08:00.676 --> 01:08:03.879
THERE BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO DO

01:08:03.946 --> 01:08:06.315
MORE FOR SUPPLY. AND THAT'S

01:08:06.382 --> 01:08:09.418
WHAT THIS BILL DOES NOW BY THE

01:08:09.485 --> 01:08:11.787
VIRTUE OF NOT HAVING ADEQUATE

01:08:11.854 --> 01:08:14.056
SUPPLY NOT ONLY HAVE WE SEEN

01:08:14.123 --> 01:08:16.025
THIS COSTS GOING UP BUT WE'VE

01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:17.693
SEEN THAT PEOPLE ARE DRIVEN

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:19.895
OUT. TO FURTHER AND FURTHER

01:08:19.962 --> 01:08:22.932
AWAY FROM THE JOB AREAS AND

01:08:22.998 --> 01:08:25.601
VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED IN THIS

01:08:25.668 --> 01:08:29.238
STATE REACHED AN ALL TIME HIGH

01:08:29.305 --> 01:08:31.440
IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THERE'S

01:08:31.507 --> 01:08:33.909
ONLY GROWING WE DON'T HVE THE

01:08:33.976 --> 01:08:36.645
NUMBERS YET FOR TWENTY NINETEEN

01:08:36.712 --> 01:08:38.781
BUT THE TREND IS OCT. KNOW WHAT

01:08:38.848 --> 01:08:41.650
IS AB ME. WE ALREADY HAVE THE

01:08:41.717 --> 01:08:43.953
DIRTIEST AIR IN THE COUNTRY.

01:08:44.019 --> 01:08:45.254
VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED

01:08:45.321 --> 01:08:46.655
INCREASING THIRTIES ARE AIR

01:08:46.722 --> 01:08:49.825
FURTHER IT JUST EXACERBATES ARE

01:08:49.892 --> 01:08:52.394
HEALTH PROBLEMS AND OF COURSE

01:08:52.461 --> 01:08:55.064
THE CLIMATE CRISIS. NOW EIGHTY

01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:57.266
USED ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND I

01:08:57.333 --> 01:08:58.834
SUPPORTED EVERY EIGHTY YOU A

01:08:58.901 --> 01:09:01.203
LOT AND EVEN CARRIED THE ONE

01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:03.873
THAT THEN GOT PASSED LAST YEAR

01:09:03.939 --> 01:09:06.041
UNDERTAKINGS NAME THAT WAS

01:09:06.108 --> 01:09:08.477
ORIGINALLY MY BILL. BUT EIGHTY

01:09:08.544 --> 01:09:11.280
USE AS IMPORTANT AS THEY ARE

01:09:11.347 --> 01:09:12.581
FOR THE SUPPLY AND I'M NEVER

01:09:12.648 --> 01:09:14.850
GONNA SPEAK AGAINST THEM THEY

01:09:14.917 --> 01:09:16.652
ARE CREATING HOUSING FOR OUR

01:09:16.719 --> 01:09:18.487
FAMILIES BY AND LARGE THE UNITS

01:09:18.554 --> 01:09:20.456
ARE TOO SMALL WE NEED FAMILY

01:09:20.523 --> 01:09:22.658
HOUSING ALSO. SO WE NEED MORE

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:24.360
THAN JUST EIGHTY USE EIGHTY

01:09:24.426 --> 01:09:25.895
YEARS ARE NOT GOING TO DO IT

01:09:25.961 --> 01:09:29.431
WHAT SB FIFTY DOES IS IT

01:09:29.498 --> 01:09:31.233
INCREASES THE HOUSING

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:34.069
OPPORTUNITY IN HIGH JOB GROWTH

01:09:34.136 --> 01:09:37.172
AREAS AND TRANSIT RICH AREAS.

01:09:37.239 --> 01:09:38.407
AREAS THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

01:09:38.474 --> 01:09:40.442
EXCLUDED FROM NEIGHBORHOODS

01:09:40.509 --> 01:09:42.611
THAT HAVE GREAT PARKS GREAT

01:09:42.678 --> 01:09:44.480
SCHOOLS AND GREAT AMENITIES.

01:09:44.547 --> 01:09:48.484
YEAH AND IT REQUIRES MORE

01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:50.786
BUILDING OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:09:50.853 --> 01:09:52.821
THAN ANY OF OUR CURRENT LAWS DO

01:09:52.888 --> 01:09:55.257
SO YES THERE'S LEGITIMATE

01:09:55.324 --> 01:09:57.459
CONCERN THAT PERHAPS THE UNITS

01:09:57.526 --> 01:09:59.762
THAT ARE UNDER SB FIFTY THE

01:09:59.828 --> 01:10:01.330
BUILDINGS THAT ARE TEN UNITS OR

01:10:01.397 --> 01:10:03.866
LESS. DON'T HAVE QUITE THE

01:10:03.933 --> 01:10:05.434
LEVEL OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:10:05.501 --> 01:10:07.703
REQUIREMENTS THAT THE ONES

01:10:07.770 --> 01:10:09.204
ABOVE TEN UNITS HAVE. THAT CAN

01:10:09.271 --> 01:10:13.008
BE ADDED BUT IT DOES FOR IT

01:10:13.075 --> 01:10:15.711
FREE AND ANY BUILDING OF ELEVEN

01:10:15.778 --> 01:10:17.379
UNITS AND HIGHER IT REQUIRES

01:10:17.446 --> 01:10:19.014
MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAN

01:10:19.081 --> 01:10:24.320
ANY OTHER LAW WE HAVE. IT ALSO.

01:10:24.386 --> 01:10:26.488
IF I CAN ADDRESS THE CONCERNS

01:10:26.555 --> 01:10:28.290
ABOUT THE HIGH FIRES AREAS YOU

01:10:28.357 --> 01:10:29.892
KNOW EVERY LOUIS IS NOT

01:10:29.959 --> 01:10:32.428
EXCLUDED IN THE BILL BUT WHAT

01:10:32.494 --> 01:10:34.563
MY COLLEAGUE WHO IS CONCERNED

01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:36.732
ABOUT THE HOUSING IN THE HIGH

01:10:36.799 --> 01:10:39.201
FIRE AREAS HAS FAILED TO

01:10:39.268 --> 01:10:42.004
MENTION IS THAT IT DOES NOT

01:10:42.071 --> 01:10:43.973
REQUIRE AN INCREASE IN DENSITY

01:10:44.039 --> 01:10:46.575
AND HIGH FIRES AREAS BECAUSE IT

01:10:46.642 --> 01:10:49.311
ALLOWS EACH LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:10:49.378 --> 01:10:52.514
FLEXIBILITY AS TO WHERE IF THEY

01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:55.851
CHOOSE NOT TO PUT THE INCREASE

01:10:55.918 --> 01:10:57.586
DENSITY. IN WHERE THE BILL IS

01:10:57.653 --> 01:11:00.422
DESIGNED THEY CAN ADJUST THAT

01:11:00.489 --> 01:11:03.959
IT GIVES FLEXIBILITY TO THE TO

01:11:04.026 --> 01:11:05.728
THE NEW BILL THE AMENDMENTS IN

01:11:05.794 --> 01:11:06.929
THE BILL BEFORE YOU AND YOU CAN

01:11:06.996 --> 01:11:09.865
READ IT GIVE FLEXIBILITY TO THE

01:11:09.932 --> 01:11:12.134
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NOW WHAT I'D

01:11:12.201 --> 01:11:14.737
FURTHER SAY IS THAT I WOULD

01:11:14.803 --> 01:11:17.439
SUPPORT A BILL. AND I HOPE THAT

01:11:17.506 --> 01:11:20.776
MY COLLEAGUE FROM THAT WAS YOU

01:11:20.843 --> 01:11:23.979
FIRE AREA WOULD PUT INTO PLACE

01:11:24.046 --> 01:11:24.480
A BILL THAT WOULD PUT A

01:11:24.546 --> 01:11:25.948
MORATORIUM. ON THE BUILDING IN

01:11:26.015 --> 01:11:27.750
THE MOST SEVERE HIGH RISK FIRE

01:11:27.816 --> 01:11:30.252
AREAS BUT I WOULD STILL NEED TO

01:11:30.319 --> 01:11:32.187
YOU. THAT YOU WILL FIND THE

01:11:32.254 --> 01:11:35.791
VERY SAME OPPOSITION THE ENTIRE

01:11:35.858 --> 01:11:36.392
LEAGUE OF CITIES WOULD OPPOSE

01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:39.428
SUCH A BILL. AND EVERY ALMOST

01:11:39.495 --> 01:11:41.864
EVERY ENTITY THAT NOW POSES

01:11:41.930 --> 01:11:43.799
FIFTY WOULD OPPOSE SUCH A BILL.

01:11:43.866 --> 01:11:45.734
SO I THINK IT'S UNFAIR TO

01:11:45.801 --> 01:11:47.936
CONFLATE THIS BILL WITH

01:11:48.003 --> 01:11:50.139
INCREASING FIRE RISK. BECAUSE

01:11:50.205 --> 01:11:52.341
THERE ARE MANY THINGS IN THE

01:11:52.408 --> 01:11:54.009
BILL THAT GIVE THE FLEXIBILITY

01:11:54.076 --> 01:11:55.577
AND THERE'S ADDITIONALLY THE

01:11:55.644 --> 01:11:58.947
POWER OF ALL OF US TO ADDRESS

01:11:59.014 --> 01:12:02.551
THE HIGH FIRE AREAS. MAYBE IN

01:12:02.618 --> 01:12:04.119
THIS BILL AS IT MOVES ON OR A

01:12:04.186 --> 01:12:06.488
SEPARATE BILL BUT YOU WATCH

01:12:06.555 --> 01:12:09.992
THAT WILL BE SO CONTROVERSIAL.

01:12:10.059 --> 01:12:11.860
SO I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO

01:12:11.927 --> 01:12:13.829
CONFLATE THAT. I THINK IT'S

01:12:13.896 --> 01:12:15.764
VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE MOVE

01:12:15.831 --> 01:12:19.101
FORWARD WITH INCREASING SUPPLY.

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:21.336
AND I'M DOING SOME OF THAT

01:12:21.403 --> 01:12:23.472
EXCLUSIONARY ZONING THAT HAS

01:12:23.539 --> 01:12:25.641
BEEN PUT INTO PLACE OVER THE

01:12:25.708 --> 01:12:27.443
LAST FORTY YEARS THAT IS

01:12:27.509 --> 01:12:29.912
PREVENTED US FROM GETTING MORE

01:12:29.978 --> 01:12:31.146
FOR HOUSING AND MORE AFFORDABLE

01:12:31.213 --> 01:12:33.816
HOUSING IN THOSE AREAS WHERE

01:12:33.882 --> 01:12:36.485
EVERYONE MOST WANTS TO LIVE

01:12:36.552 --> 01:12:38.120
THOSE AREAS WITH THE HIGH

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:39.688
QUALITY SCHOOLS AND THE HIGH

01:12:39.755 --> 01:12:41.256
QUALITY PARKS. AND ALL THE

01:12:41.323 --> 01:12:43.092
OTHER AMENITIES AND WITH THAT I

01:12:43.158 --> 01:12:44.226
ASKED FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

01:12:44.293 --> 01:12:51.433
SENATOR BILL. OUR PRESIDENT TO

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:55.804
A MEMBERS. I HAVE A QUALIFIED

01:12:55.871 --> 01:13:00.642
YES VOTE ON THIS BILL. AND I'M

01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:02.177
VOTING FOR TODAY BECAUSE I

01:13:02.244 --> 01:13:02.711
WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT MOVE

01:13:02.778 --> 01:13:05.280
FORWARD. BUT I RESERVE THE

01:13:05.347 --> 01:13:07.316
RIGHT TO CHANGE MY VOTE. WHEN

01:13:07.382 --> 01:13:09.284
IT COMES BACK TO THE CENTER

01:13:09.351 --> 01:13:11.587
FROM THE ASSEMBLY AS WE KNOW

01:13:11.653 --> 01:13:12.855
AND I'VE BEEN HERE FOR THIRTEEN

01:13:12.921 --> 01:13:16.492
YEARS SOMETIMES BILLS GO TO THE

01:13:16.558 --> 01:13:18.293
ASSEMBLY THERE CONTROVERSIAL

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:19.194
THEY COME BACK AND YOU DON'T

01:13:19.261 --> 01:13:21.363
EVEN KNOW. WHAT THEY SAY

01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:23.732
ANYMORE BECAUSE THEY'RE- OFTEN

01:13:23.799 --> 01:13:26.034
CHANGE IN A RADICAL WAY I ALSO

01:13:26.101 --> 01:13:28.470
WANT TO HEAR FROM THE GOVERNOR.

01:13:28.537 --> 01:13:30.773
GOVERNOR IS GOT A BUDGET HE'S

01:13:30.839 --> 01:13:32.007
GONNA BE WORKING ON AND I'M

01:13:32.074 --> 01:13:35.043
CURIOUS AS TO. WHAT HIS POLICY

01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:38.180
DIRECTIVES ARE ON THAT. NOW SB

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:39.314
FIFTY MAY INCREASE HOUSING

01:13:39.381 --> 01:13:40.716
PRODUCTION BUT WILL NOT ADDRESS

01:13:40.783 --> 01:13:42.417
ARE HOMELESS CRISIS.

01:13:42.484 --> 01:13:43.786
STREAMLINING THE BUILDING

01:13:43.852 --> 01:13:45.387
PERMIT PROCESS TO MAKE IT

01:13:45.454 --> 01:13:48.257
EASIER FOR DEVELOPERS WILL

01:13:48.323 --> 01:13:50.192
GENERATE MORE HOUSING UNITS.

01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:51.960
BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE

01:13:52.027 --> 01:13:53.695
UNITS WILL BE MARKET RATE.

01:13:53.762 --> 01:13:55.831
CITIES LIKE MY SAN JOSE AND LOS

01:13:55.898 --> 01:13:58.534
ANGELES DESPITE BEST INTENTIONS

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:00.669
ARE STRUGGLING TO KEEP UP WITH

01:14:00.736 --> 01:14:01.670
THE EVER GROWING PRODUCTION

01:14:01.737 --> 01:14:04.606
NEEDS TO KEEP THE RENT BURDEN

01:14:04.673 --> 01:14:06.608
AND A VERY LOW INCOME FAMILIES

01:14:06.675 --> 01:14:08.911
OFF OUR STREETS. THE MARKET

01:14:08.977 --> 01:14:10.679
RATE HOUSING IS PART OF THE

01:14:10.746 --> 01:14:13.549
SOLUTION. BUT WITHOUT

01:14:13.615 --> 01:14:15.717
DELIBERATE INVESTMENTS IN

01:14:15.784 --> 01:14:17.419

WITH THE MOST SEVERE NEEDS IT

01:14:22.491 --> 01:14:24.059
CONTRIBUTES TO THE RISING COST

01:14:24.126 --> 01:14:25.460
OF RANTS AS PROPERTY VALUES

01:14:25.527 --> 01:14:28.530
INCREASE ESPECIALLY ALONG

01:14:28.597 --> 01:14:30.699
TRANSIT QUARTERS AND THAT'S WHY

01:14:30.766 --> 01:14:33.368
THE STATE NEEDS TO INVEST IN

01:14:33.435 --> 01:14:34.770
ONGOING FUNDS TO BUILD

01:14:34.837 --> 01:14:37.272

MAKING 30% AREA MEDIAN INCOME

01:14:42.477 --> 01:14:45.113
OR LOWER. THESE FAMILIES ARE IN

01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:47.249
THE HOMELESS PIPELINE NOW

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:49.785
DEVOID OF ANY STATE SUBSIDY

01:14:49.852 --> 01:14:51.386
THERE IS NO INCENTIVE TO BUILD

01:14:51.453 --> 01:14:53.055
AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE PROJECT

01:14:53.121 --> 01:14:55.490

01:14:55.557 --> 01:14:56.992
YOU COULD JUST BASICALLY AUS

THAT. ALL THE PAST SEVERAL

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:03.098
YEARS WE HAVE MADE HISTORICAL

01:15:03.165 --> 01:15:05.300
ONE TIME- INVESTMENTS TO

01:15:05.367 --> 01:15:06.869
SHELTER THOSE ON OUR CITY

01:15:06.935 --> 01:15:08.503
STREETS AND PROVIDED

01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:10.305

01:30:07.535 --> 01:30:09.771
OVER SIMPLIFY OUR CONVERSATION

01:30:09.837 --> 01:30:12.206
ABOUT WE NEED HOUSING I WORK

01:30:12.273 --> 01:30:14.842
FOR AN ORGANIZATION THAT- HAD

01:30:14.909 --> 01:30:17.245
A- MONSTER THAT HARD WORK IS

01:30:17.311 --> 01:30:18.946
EASY WORK NOT DONE A PROPER

01:30:19.013 --> 01:30:21.048
TIME LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT

01:30:21.115 --> 01:30:23.184
ACROSS THE STATE HAVE FAILED

01:30:23.251 --> 01:30:24.852
ALL OF US IN OUR RESIDENTS IN

01:30:24.919 --> 01:30:26.187
TERMS OF NOT DOING THE PROPER

01:30:26.254 --> 01:30:28.523
WORK RIGHT TIME IN TERMS BEEN

01:30:28.589 --> 01:30:30.258
AGGRESSIVE IN TERMS OF MAKING

01:30:30.324 --> 01:30:33.127
SURE WE BUILD ADEQUATE HOUSING

01:30:33.194 --> 01:30:35.296
FOR ALL ACROSS THE SOCIO

01:30:35.363 --> 01:30:37.398
ECONOMIC SPECTRUM. I THINK IT'S

01:30:37.465 --> 01:30:39.333
ALSO IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE IN

01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:41.235
MY DISTRICT SPECIFICALLY SOUTH

01:30:41.302 --> 01:30:44.505
LA. SINGLE FAMILY HOMES DO

01:30:44.572 --> 01:30:47.642
DOMINATE THE LANDSCAPE AND ARE

01:30:47.708 --> 01:30:49.811
IN DIRECT CLOSE PROXIMITY TO

01:30:49.877 --> 01:30:51.979
MAJOR TRANSIT ZONES THAT'S THE

01:30:52.046 --> 01:30:53.614
REALITY OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN

01:30:53.681 --> 01:30:55.416
THE THIRTY TH DISTRICT. I THINK

01:30:55.483 --> 01:30:56.651
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO REMIT

01:30:56.717 --> 01:30:59.353
RECOGNIZE THAT SINGLE FAMILY

01:30:59.420 --> 01:30:59.987
HOMEOWNERS ARE NOT A MONOLITHIC

01:31:00.054 --> 01:31:02.824
GROUP. THAT SAME COMMUNITY WAS

01:31:02.890 --> 01:31:04.692
ALSO RAVAGED BY THE HOUSING

01:31:04.759 --> 01:31:06.527
CRASH PRICES AND HAVE BEEN

01:31:06.594 --> 01:31:08.129
SUBJECTED TO RED LINING AND

01:31:08.196 --> 01:31:10.798
PAID FOR A HIGHER INTEREST

01:31:10.865 --> 01:31:11.566
RATES FOR MORTGAGES IF THEY CAN

01:31:11.632 --> 01:31:13.701
GET THEM. AND SO WE HAVE SINGLE

01:31:13.768 --> 01:31:15.736
FAMILY HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE

01:31:15.803 --> 01:31:18.072
HOLDING ON. BY THEIR

01:31:18.139 --> 01:31:20.608
FINGERNAILS IN TERMS OF KEEPING

01:31:20.675 --> 01:31:22.743
THOSE HOUSES AND SO AS WE DO

01:31:22.810 --> 01:31:24.345
TALK ABOUT COMMUNITIES THAT

01:31:24.412 --> 01:31:25.880
HAVE DOMINATED A

01:31:25.947 --> 01:31:27.515
DISPROPORTIONATE BURKE ENTERS.

01:31:27.582 --> 01:31:28.616
SOME OF US REPRESENT

01:31:28.683 --> 01:31:30.585
COMMUNITIES TO. DO HAVE

01:31:30.651 --> 01:31:34.188
HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE HOLDING ON

01:31:34.255 --> 01:31:36.490
BY THE SKIN OF THEIR TEETH. WE

01:31:36.557 --> 01:31:37.391
HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THE

01:31:37.458 --> 01:31:40.695
DIFFERENCE THE DIVERSITY OF THE

01:31:40.761 --> 01:31:44.832
HOUSING. MARKET AND THOSE WHO

01:31:44.899 --> 01:31:47.835
ARE IN IT. FOR ME THE CORE

01:31:47.902 --> 01:31:50.571
ISSUE AS WE DEBATE THE HOUSING

01:31:50.638 --> 01:31:53.241
CRISIS BECAUSE WE ARE IN ONE.

01:31:53.307 --> 01:31:55.176
IS CAN BE SUMMED UP IN ONE

01:31:55.243 --> 01:31:58.012
SENTENCE WHO HAS THE PRIVILEGE

01:31:58.079 --> 01:32:03.284
OF LIVING WHERE. AND AS WE DO

01:32:03.351 --> 01:32:04.619
CONFLATE ISSUES BECAUSE A WHOLE

01:32:04.685 --> 01:32:06.053
LOT OF CONFLATION OF GOING ON

01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:08.289
WITH REGARD TO SB FIFTY. THE

01:32:08.356 --> 01:32:09.824
ISSUE OF GENTRIFICATION COMES

01:32:09.891 --> 01:32:11.292
OUT RESOUNDINGLY IN MY

01:32:11.359 --> 01:32:14.228
COMMUNITY. AND THE ISSUE OF

01:32:14.295 --> 01:32:16.430
GENTRIFICATION IS SYNONYMOUS

01:32:16.497 --> 01:32:21.135
WITH THE YEAR. EIGHT CORE FEAR

01:32:21.202 --> 01:32:24.238
ABOUT CAN I AFFORD TO CONTINUE

01:32:24.305 --> 01:32:26.841
TO LIVE IN MY COMMUNITY. WE'LL

01:32:26.908 --> 01:32:28.976
DEVELOPERS AND SPECULATORS BY

01:32:29.043 --> 01:32:30.378
UP THE PROPERTY AROUND ME AND

01:32:30.444 --> 01:32:31.979
MAKE MY COMMUNITY LOOK AND FEEL

01:32:32.046 --> 01:32:34.782
DIFFERENT. WHO WILL BE MY NEW

01:32:34.849 --> 01:32:38.953
NEIGHBORS. FEAR AROUND ALL OF

01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:41.455
THOSE CORE ISSUES. AND SO WE

01:32:41.522 --> 01:32:42.990
CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT

01:32:43.057 --> 01:32:45.259
HOUSING POLICY ABSENT THE

01:32:45.326 --> 01:32:46.827
REALITY OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE

01:32:46.894 --> 01:32:49.130
FEELING IN THEIR OWN TOWNS AND

01:32:49.196 --> 01:32:53.200
NEIGHBORHOODS. YOU KNOW I HAVE

01:32:53.267 --> 01:32:55.303

THANK YOU MISSED AUTHOR. UP

PRETTY CONSISTENTLY FOR ABOUT

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:01.108
THREE YEARS NOW WE DID A

01:33:01.175 --> 01:33:02.109
CALCULATION THIS MORNING IN MY

01:33:02.176 --> 01:33:03.644
OFFICE AND WE'VE BEEN INVITED

01:33:03.711 --> 01:33:05.112
TO PARTICIPATE IT EITHER MYSELF

01:33:05.179 --> 01:33:07.949
OR STAFF IT LITERALLY A DOZEN

01:33:08.015 --> 01:33:11.919
CONVENIENCE. ENGAGING THOUSANDS

01:33:11.986 --> 01:33:14.822
PLURAL OF RESIDENTS OF THE

01:33:14.889 --> 01:33:15.456
THIRTY SENATE-DISTRICT THE TALK

01:33:15.523 --> 01:33:17.391
ABOUT THIS ISSUE. AND I PUSH

01:33:17.458 --> 01:33:19.860
BACK CARD I SAID IF NOT SB

01:33:19.927 --> 01:33:21.595
FIFTY IF YOU SAY NOT SB FIFTY

01:33:21.662 --> 01:33:24.098
WOULD YOU SAY YES TO. AND I

01:33:24.165 --> 01:33:25.566
HAVE TO GIVE MY CONSTITUENTS

01:33:25.633 --> 01:33:26.167
CREDIT BECAUSE THEY STEPPED UP

01:33:26.233 --> 01:33:29.804
TO THE PLATE. AND WE HAVE LISTS

01:33:29.870 --> 01:33:33.841
AND CHARTS- OF IDEAS MOST OF

01:33:33.908 --> 01:33:34.709
WHICH I HAVE SHARED WITH THE

01:33:34.775 --> 01:33:36.277
AUTHOR SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN

01:33:36.344 --> 01:33:37.545
INCLUDED IN BILLS THAT WE'VE

01:33:37.611 --> 01:33:39.847
PASSING CLEAN SB THREE THIRTY

01:33:39.914 --> 01:33:42.350
WHICH I DID VOTE FOR. I WAS

01:33:42.416 --> 01:33:45.419
HESITANT AND RIDICULE FOR IT

01:33:45.486 --> 01:33:46.687
FOR NOT MAKING A PUBLIC

01:33:46.754 --> 01:33:47.955
STATEMENT A WHERE I'D BE WITH

01:33:48.022 --> 01:33:50.024
THE BILL A YEAR AGO. AND I

01:33:50.091 --> 01:33:51.359
DIDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE I

01:33:51.425 --> 01:33:51.892
UNDERSTAND THE LEGISLATIVE

01:33:51.959 --> 01:33:53.995
PROCESS. AND SO I DIDN'T GO

01:33:54.061 --> 01:33:55.997
PUBLIC AGAIN NOT DIRECTLY TO

01:33:56.063 --> 01:33:57.832
THE MEDIA BUT TO AT MY

01:33:57.898 --> 01:33:58.599
COMMUNITY AT TOWN HALL THIS

01:33:58.666 --> 01:34:00.401
WEEK ABOUT MY POSITION BECAUSE

01:34:00.468 --> 01:34:02.937
I COULD THEN OPINE ON THE FINAL

01:34:03.004 --> 01:34:04.805
VERSION OF THE BILL THAT I KNEW

01:34:04.872 --> 01:34:06.407
WE WOULD BE VOTING ON TODAY.

01:34:06.474 --> 01:34:08.242
AND SO THIS IS A PROCESS I GET

01:34:08.309 --> 01:34:11.212
THAT. BUT AGAIN I HAVE TO

01:34:11.278 --> 01:34:12.513
CONCUR WITH MANY OF THE ISSUES

01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:14.248
RAISED BY MY COLLEAGUES ABOUT

01:34:14.315 --> 01:34:16.884
WHY THIS IS IT. RIGHT FOR THE

01:34:16.951 --> 01:34:18.085
RESIDENTS OF MY DISTRICT AT

01:34:18.152 --> 01:34:21.789
THIS TIME. WE MUST CONTINUE TO

01:34:21.856 --> 01:34:23.557
HAVE A BROADER CONVERSATION

01:34:23.624 --> 01:34:25.459
ABOUT HOW WE DIG OURSELVES OUT

01:34:25.526 --> 01:34:29.130
OF THE HOUSING CRISIS WERE IN.

01:34:29.196 --> 01:34:31.365
ZONING IS ONE KEY ISSUE

01:34:31.432 --> 01:34:33.000
RECOGNIZING THE HISTORICAL

01:34:33.067 --> 01:34:34.502
ROLES ONLY HAS PLAYED IN

01:34:34.568 --> 01:34:36.037
KEEPING CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE

01:34:36.103 --> 01:34:36.537
COMMUNITY OUT OF CERTAIN

01:34:36.604 --> 01:34:38.706
COMMUNITIES. AND I APPRECIATE

01:34:38.773 --> 01:34:39.607
THAT THERE ARE MANY CITIES

01:34:39.673 --> 01:34:40.641
ACROSS THIS COUNTRY WERE

01:34:40.708 --> 01:34:44.178
ELIMINATING- EXCLUSIONARY

01:34:44.245 --> 01:34:44.879
ZONING FOR THAT HAS TO BE

01:34:44.945 --> 01:34:46.881
ADDRESSED. BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE

01:34:46.947 --> 01:34:48.949
THIS CONVERSATION IN A BROADER

01:34:49.016 --> 01:34:51.485
CONTEXT WITH MULTIPLE OPTIONS

01:34:51.552 --> 01:34:53.721
TO HELP. EVERYONE ACROSS THE

01:34:53.788 --> 01:34:55.523
BOARD. IN TERMS OF

01:34:55.589 --> 01:34:58.092
AFFORDABILITY. I WILL NOT BE

01:34:58.159 --> 01:35:00.061
SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY I

01:35:00.127 --> 01:35:01.595
WILL STAND UP AND SEND ALONG

01:35:01.662 --> 01:35:02.997
SIDE MY COLLEAGUES AS WE

01:35:03.064 --> 01:35:04.965
CONTINUE TO BRING FORWARD

01:35:05.032 --> 01:35:07.168
EQUALLY AS CHALLENGING COMPLEX

01:35:07.234 --> 01:35:09.503
MEASURES. TO ADDRESS NOT ONLY

01:35:09.570 --> 01:35:10.871
THE ROOT CAUSES OF OUR CURRENT

01:35:10.938 --> 01:35:13.274
HOUSING CRISIS BUT HOW WE WILL

01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:14.875
LEAD CALIFORNIA IN BEGIN OUR

01:35:14.942 --> 01:35:21.949
WAY OUT OF IT. CENTER DOLLY.

01:35:22.016 --> 01:35:22.483
THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT

01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:25.786
MEMBERS I. RISE IN THE SUPPORT

01:35:25.853 --> 01:35:28.456
THIS BILL I WANTED. SHARE MAYBE

01:35:28.522 --> 01:35:29.523
A LITTLE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE

01:35:29.590 --> 01:35:32.493
THAT I HAVEN'T HEARD YET SPOKEN

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:35.963
ABOUT HERE TODAY. I THINK THIS

01:35:36.030 --> 01:35:37.698
IS A HEALTHY DEBATE I GIVE THE

01:35:37.765 --> 01:35:39.567
AUTHOR A LOT OF CREDIT FOR

01:35:39.633 --> 01:35:41.235
TACKLING THIS ISSUE THIS IS NOT

01:35:41.302 --> 01:35:45.306
EASY. IT'S CONTROVERSIAL- BUT A

01:35:45.372 --> 01:35:48.476
LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY BACKGROUND

01:35:48.542 --> 01:35:49.043
SIXTEEN YEARS ON A BOARD OF

01:35:49.110 --> 01:35:52.680
SUPERVISORS DOING GENERAL PLANS

01:35:52.746 --> 01:35:56.717
AND HEARING COUNTLESS VERY WELL

01:35:56.784 --> 01:36:00.354
EDUCATED PLANNERS ABOUT SMART

01:36:00.421 --> 01:36:02.890
GROWTH AND ABOUT SUSTAINABLE

01:36:02.957 --> 01:36:05.693
COMMUNITIES. AND ABOUT ALL THE

01:36:05.759 --> 01:36:07.361
REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD BUILD

01:36:07.428 --> 01:36:09.530
WHERE YOU SHOULD BUILD TO MAKE

01:36:09.597 --> 01:36:12.466
A SOCIETY- WORK IN A MANNER

01:36:12.533 --> 01:36:15.369
WHERE WE DON'T HAVE A FOOT

01:36:15.436 --> 01:36:18.839
PRINT ON THE LAND. AS HARSH AS

01:36:18.906 --> 01:36:21.709
IT CAN BE IN SOME AREAS. AND

01:36:21.775 --> 01:36:22.309
WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF TESTIMONY

01:36:22.376 --> 01:36:24.245
TODAY ABOUT. WAS SITTING IN

01:36:24.311 --> 01:36:26.614
THEIR AUTOMOBILES FOR HOURS

01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:29.850
MIGRATING TO AND FROM WORK. YOU

01:36:29.917 --> 01:36:32.286
KNOW YOU ALL KNOW I FARM AND

01:36:32.353 --> 01:36:33.621
ONE OF THE REASONS I GOT

01:36:33.687 --> 01:36:37.458
INVOLVED IN. POLITICS AND RUN

01:36:37.525 --> 01:36:41.061
FOR OFFICE WAS BECAUSE I SAW US

01:36:41.128 --> 01:36:43.364
PAVING OVER OUR FARM LAND'S.

01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:45.566
AND I THINK THAT'S WRONG I

01:36:45.633 --> 01:36:46.200
THINK THERE'S BETTER PLACES THE

01:36:46.267 --> 01:36:49.336
BILL DIDN'T ON OUR PURPOSE-

01:36:49.403 --> 01:36:52.006
FERTILE SOILS AND WHERE WE HAVE

01:36:52.072 --> 01:36:53.207
WATER TO GROW OUR CROPS. IT'S

01:36:53.274 --> 01:36:56.644
SO TODAY I LOOK AT THIS BILL

01:36:56.710 --> 01:36:58.879
AND I I'VE BEEN TOLD IN OUR

01:36:58.946 --> 01:37:01.282
DISTRICT HOW TO MANAGE MY LAND

01:37:01.348 --> 01:37:04.051
BY PEOPLE WHO DON'T MANAGE LAND

01:37:04.118 --> 01:37:06.086
I'VE HEARD FROM PEOPLE IN OTHER

01:37:06.153 --> 01:37:07.354
PARTS OF THE COUNTRY HOW TO

01:37:07.421 --> 01:37:09.890
MANAGE OUR FEDERAL FORCED TO

01:37:09.957 --> 01:37:10.424
DON'T LIVE. IN OUR FEDERAL

01:37:10.491 --> 01:37:14.762
FOREST. AND WE'RE BURNING DOWN

01:37:14.828 --> 01:37:15.396
AND WE SEE A LOT OF THINGS THAT

01:37:15.462 --> 01:37:18.632
AREN'T RIGHT. NOW IF YOU LOOK

01:37:18.699 --> 01:37:19.967
AT THIS BILL AND YOU LOOK AT

01:37:20.034 --> 01:37:22.503
WHAT IT IS DESIGNED TO DO IS

01:37:22.570 --> 01:37:25.539
DESIGNED TO PUT PEOPLE. WHERE

01:37:25.606 --> 01:37:28.175
THEY WORK AND KEEP THEM. FROM

01:37:28.242 --> 01:37:30.344
BUILDING IN OUR FARM LAND'S.

01:37:30.411 --> 01:37:32.279
END BEIG SITTING IN CARS AND

01:37:32.346 --> 01:37:34.748
DOING OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT AND

01:37:34.815 --> 01:37:36.984
ARE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY SO I

01:37:37.051 --> 01:37:38.886
LOOK AT IT AND THAT TAXED. IS

01:37:38.953 --> 01:37:41.188
IT PERFECT THERE'S NO BILL

01:37:41.255 --> 01:37:43.624
THAT'S PERFECT IN THIS PLACE. I

01:37:43.691 --> 01:37:45.092
HEARD TALK ABOUT THE WILDLAND

01:37:45.159 --> 01:37:47.661
URBAN INTERFACE. DO YOU GET A

01:37:47.728 --> 01:37:49.063
BILL EVERY HOME IN THE VALLEY

01:37:49.129 --> 01:37:50.397
OF THIS STATE BECAUSE MOST OF

01:37:50.464 --> 01:37:51.699
THE REST THE STATE AS WILDLAND

01:37:51.765 --> 01:37:54.134
URBAN INTERFACE I HELD A MAP

01:37:54.201 --> 01:37:56.337
BUT WE DID SB NINE A ONE. AND

01:37:56.403 --> 01:37:58.806
IT'S READ ON EVERY SIDE EVEN

WORKS WHEN YOU DRIVE THE SUPPLY

UP THEY'LL BE LESS DEMAND AND

01:38:45.786 --> 01:38:47.588
IT DRIVES ACOSTA DOWN. WE NEED

DISAGREE AND OPPOSE SB FIFTY-

01:39:33.867 --> 01:39:36.503
LAST YEAR WHEN I PUT THIS ON

THE TO YOUR BILL LIST- I DID

01:39:39.606 --> 01:39:42.109
THAT ON PURPOSE IN ORDER NOT TO

01:39:42.176 --> 01:39:44.378
STOP THE DEBATE. MY HOPE WAS

01:39:44.445 --> 01:39:47.681
THAT OVER THE BREAK- WE COULD

01:39:47.748 --> 01:39:49.850
ENGAGE PEOPLE IN A PRODUCTIVE

01:39:49.917 --> 01:39:52.553
CONVERSATION- TO ADDRESS MANY

01:39:52.619 --> 01:39:54.321
OF THE COMMENTS AND CONCERNS

01:39:54.388 --> 01:39:56.323
THAT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED TODAY-

01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:57.524
THE FACT YOU HAVE SO MANY

01:39:57.591 --> 01:39:59.360
PEOPLE STANDING UP. EXPRESSING

01:39:59.426 --> 01:40:01.095
VERY SIMILAR COMMENTS

01:40:01.161 --> 01:40:02.429
UNDERSCORES THAT THESE ARE

01:40:02.496 --> 01:40:04.765
LEGITIMATE CONCERNS- THAT WAS

01:40:04.832 --> 01:40:07.434
MY HOPE- BECAUSE I LEARNED BACK

01:40:07.501 --> 01:40:10.637
IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. WHEN WE

01:40:10.704 --> 01:40:12.039
HAD A DEDICATED FUNDING SOURCE

01:40:12.106 --> 01:40:13.507
FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING CALLED

01:40:13.574 --> 01:40:15.976
REDEVELOPMENT. AND WE DISSOLVED

01:40:16.043 --> 01:40:18.812
IT. AND AT THE TIME THERE WAS

01:40:18.879 --> 01:40:19.813
TALK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:21.515
HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE. WE'RE

01:40:21.582 --> 01:40:23.450
GONNA DO SOMETHING BETTER.

01:40:23.517 --> 01:40:24.918
WE'RE GOING TO IMPROVE THE

01:40:24.985 --> 01:40:26.720
PROCESS WE'RE GONNA NOT FORGET

01:40:26.787 --> 01:40:27.821
ABOUT FINDING AFFORDABLE

01:40:27.888 --> 01:40:31.091
HOUSING AND I SAID AT THE TIME.

01:40:31.158 --> 01:40:34.194
DON'T DO AWAY WITH THIS PROGRAM

01:40:34.261 --> 01:40:35.763
AND TO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A

01:40:35.829 --> 01:40:39.299
REPLACEMENT IN PLACE. SO WE CAN

01:40:39.366 --> 01:40:40.734
CONTINUE TO FUND AFFORDABLE

01:40:40.801 --> 01:40:42.803
HOUSING. AND EVERYBODY SAID

01:40:42.870 --> 01:40:44.538
DON'T WORRY. WE'LL GET IT

01:40:44.605 --> 01:40:48.041
RIGHT. JUST NOT TODAY. WELL

01:40:48.108 --> 01:40:50.477
HERE WE ARE NEARLY A DECADE

01:40:50.544 --> 01:40:52.679
LATER AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN

01:40:52.746 --> 01:40:53.981
JOSE AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM

01:40:54.047 --> 01:40:56.683
HUMBOLDT AND I JOINTLY AUTHORED

01:40:56.750 --> 01:40:59.319
SB FIVE. STILL TRYING TO

01:40:59.386 --> 01:41:01.455
REPLACE THAT DEDICATED FUNDING

01:41:01.522 --> 01:41:03.457
SOURCE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:41:03.524 --> 01:41:05.192
AND HAD WE NOT DONE AWAY WITH

01:41:05.259 --> 01:41:06.693
REDEVELOPMENT WE WOULD HAVE

01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:08.662
PROBABLY HAD ABOUT TEN BILLION

01:41:08.729 --> 01:41:11.732
DOLLARS SPENT. ON ACTUALLY

01:41:11.799 --> 01:41:13.867
CONSTRUCTING AFFORDABLE

01:41:13.934 --> 01:41:18.005
HOUSING. SO I SHARE THAT. TO

01:41:18.071 --> 01:41:20.507
UNDERSCORE OUR RESPONSIBILITY

01:41:20.574 --> 01:41:23.710
TODAY TO GET IT RIGHT. BECAUSE

01:41:23.777 --> 01:41:27.514
WE GOT IT WRONG A DECADE AGO

01:41:27.581 --> 01:41:28.382
AND THAT'S WHY THIS IS A

01:41:28.449 --> 01:41:30.184
CRITICAL CONVERSATION AND WHEN

01:41:30.250 --> 01:41:33.720
I HEAR MY GOOD COLLEAGUES WHO I

01:41:33.787 --> 01:41:34.988
RESPECT TREMENDOUSLY TALK ABOUT

01:41:35.055 --> 01:41:38.625
WELL THIS WILL COME BACK TO US.

01:41:38.692 --> 01:41:39.993
WELL IT'LL COME BACK TO US ON

01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:42.196
CONCURRENCE WERE WILL ONLY HAVE

01:41:42.262 --> 01:41:43.964
THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO AN UPPER

01:41:44.031 --> 01:41:45.532
DOWN VOTE WE WILL HAVE THE

01:41:45.599 --> 01:41:47.334
OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY LOOK

01:41:47.401 --> 01:41:51.038
AND DISCUSS. THE POLICY. IN THE

01:41:51.104 --> 01:41:53.540
POLICY COMMITTEE ON THE MERITS

01:41:53.607 --> 01:41:55.642
OF THOSE AMENDMENTS AND SO.

01:41:55.709 --> 01:41:57.244
THAT'S WHY IT'S CRITICAL THAT

01:41:57.311 --> 01:41:58.779
WE TAKE THIS TIME AND I THINK

01:41:58.846 --> 01:42:00.948
IT WAS THE MAJORITY LEADER WHO

01:42:01.014 --> 01:42:04.251
MENTIONED. THIS BILL IF IT WERE

01:42:04.318 --> 01:42:06.286
TO MOVE OUT OF THIS HOUSE TODAY.

01:42:06.353 --> 01:42:07.521
WOULD STILL BE GOING THROUGH

01:42:07.588 --> 01:42:09.990
THE SAME PROCESS F. OF ANOTHER

01:42:10.057 --> 01:42:12.960
BILL WAS INTRODUCED SO. THE

01:42:13.026 --> 01:42:15.696
URGENCY OF THE SITUATION. CRIES

01:42:15.762 --> 01:42:17.097
OUT THAT WE ADDRESS THE

01:42:17.164 --> 01:42:18.432
AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS IN

01:42:18.499 --> 01:42:22.436
CALIFORNIA WITH URGENCY. BUT

01:42:22.503 --> 01:42:24.605
THIS BILL DOESN'T DO THA. AND

01:42:24.671 --> 01:42:26.473
BY PASSING IT ALONG A DOZEN

01:42:26.540 --> 01:42:29.343
EXPEDITE THAT CONVERSATION IT

01:42:29.409 --> 01:42:30.844
FRANKLY SHORT CHANGED IS THAT

01:42:30.911 --> 01:42:34.181
CONVERSATION. IN THIS HOUSE THE

01:42:34.248 --> 01:42:36.583
STATE SENATE AND I THINK THAT'S

01:42:36.650 --> 01:42:38.886
IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS IT'S BEEN

01:42:38.952 --> 01:42:41.188
RAISED WE HAVE AN AFFORDABLE

01:42:41.255 --> 01:42:44.191
HOUSING CRISIS BUT YET IF YOU

01:42:44.258 --> 01:42:46.360
DO TEN UNITS OR LOWER. THERE'S

01:42:46.426 --> 01:42:48.295
NO AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT GETS

01:42:48.362 --> 01:42:50.731
DONE WITH THIS BILL IF YOU DO

01:42:50.797 --> 01:42:51.999
TWENTY UNITS TO TEN UNITS YOU

01:42:52.065 --> 01:42:54.535
CAN PAINT TO A FINE AND NOT

01:42:54.601 --> 01:42:58.205
BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

01:42:58.272 --> 01:43:00.173
THAT'S AN EASILY SOLVABLE

01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:02.209
CHANGE IN THIS BILL THAT COULD

01:43:02.276 --> 01:43:04.745
HAVE BEEN DONE OVER THE LAST

01:43:04.811 --> 01:43:06.947
SIX MONTHS BUT IT WASN'T SO

01:43:07.014 --> 01:43:10.851
THAT BEGS THE QUESTION. WHY WHY

01:43:10.918 --> 01:43:12.986
DIDN'T WE MAKE THIS BILL ABOUT

01:43:13.053 --> 01:43:15.088
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IT'S BEEN

01:43:15.155 --> 01:43:16.957
ARGUED SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND

01:43:17.024 --> 01:43:20.093
TRICKLE DOWN ARE VALID SERIES

01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:21.295
WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST THAT

01:43:21.361 --> 01:43:22.996
THEY HAVEN'T REALLY WORKED ALL

01:43:23.063 --> 01:43:25.966
THAT MUCH THAT WELL- AND ONE

01:43:26.033 --> 01:43:26.934
COULD ARGUE THAT IF YOU

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.702
INCREASE DENSITY YOUR

01:43:28.769 --> 01:43:30.571
INCREASING LAND VALUE WHICH

01:43:30.637 --> 01:43:33.307
INCREASES CONSTRUCTION COSTS

01:43:33.373 --> 01:43:36.176
WHICH RAISES RENTS. IT DOESN'T

01:43:36.243 --> 01:43:39.746
LOWER RENTS AND SO MUCH HAS

01:43:39.813 --> 01:43:41.481
BEEN MADE ABOUT THE COMMUNITIES

01:43:41.548 --> 01:43:42.416
IN THE PLACE AND THE

01:43:42.482 --> 01:43:43.884
SPECULATION OF WHERE THE

01:43:43.951 --> 01:43:45.986
OPPOSITION IS COMING FROM. AND

01:43:46.053 --> 01:43:47.588
&lt;c.cyan&gt;RANKLY MOST OF THE COMMUNITIES&lt;/c&gt;

01:43:47.654 --> 01:43:49.256
THAT I HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM

01:43:49.323 --> 01:43:51.024
HAVE BEEN IN MY GOOD SENATOR TO

01:43:51.091 --> 01:43:53.760
MY LEFT. COMMUNITY AND MY SEAT

01:43:53.827 --> 01:43:55.696
MATES COMMUNITY HARD WORKING

01:43:55.762 --> 01:43:57.564
CLASS COMMUNITIES CLOSE TO

01:43:57.631 --> 01:44:00.067
DOWNTOWN LA. AS MY COLLEAGUE

01:44:00.133 --> 01:44:01.702
FROM LA TALK ABOUT WHO ARE IN

01:44:01.768 --> 01:44:03.904
FEAR. OF DISPLACEMENT AND

01:44:03.971 --> 01:44:05.439
GENTRIFICATION AND I THINK FOR

01:44:05.505 --> 01:44:07.874
GOOD REASON WHEN YOU'RE TALKING

01:44:07.941 --> 01:44:09.009
ABOUT IS MY OTHER CALLING FROM

01:44:09.076 --> 01:44:11.378
LOS ANGELES MANSION. THIS IS

01:44:11.445 --> 01:44:13.614
ABOUT MARKET RATE HOUSING.

01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:15.849
THERE IS A LEGITIMATE FEAR IN

01:44:15.916 --> 01:44:17.884
THOSE COMMUNITIES WITH.

01:44:17.951 --> 01:44:20.621
ADEQUATE PROTECTIONS WITHOUT

01:44:20.687 --> 01:44:22.055
SAYING THAT THESE HAVE TO BE

01:44:22.122 --> 01:44:23.357
AFFORDABLE UNITS WITHOUT

01:44:23.423 --> 01:44:27.561
PUTTING SERIOUS- CONTROLS ON

01:44:27.628 --> 01:44:29.596
HOW MUCH THEY WOULD GO IN THAT

01:44:29.663 --> 01:44:31.965
MARKET RATE PROPOSAL. THOSE ARE

01:44:32.032 --> 01:44:34.501
LEGITIMATE CONCERNS AND SO I

01:44:34.568 --> 01:44:35.636
BELIEVE MY COLLEAGUE SHOULD BE

01:44:35.702 --> 01:44:37.471
COMMENDED BECAUSE THE OTHER

01:44:37.537 --> 01:44:38.905
THING THAT'S BEING MENTIONED IS

01:44:38.972 --> 01:44:39.840
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:44:39.906 --> 01:44:42.409
RESPONSIBILITY WELL I CHARGE

DISTRICT WITH COMING UP WITH

01:44:49.049 --> 01:44:50.517
ALTERNATIVES. AND THEY ARE

01:44:50.584 --> 01:44:51.918
INITIALLY CAME UP WITH THOSE

01:44:51.985 --> 01:44:53.420
ALTERNATIVES AND THEY PUT THEM

01:44:53.487 --> 01:44:55.022
ON THE TABLE AND THEY WANTED TO

01:44:55.088 --> 01:44:57.958
GET TO YES SO MY COLLEAGUE FROM

01:44:58.025 --> 01:45:00.293
SAN FRANCISCO. MOVED THE LOCAL

01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:02.062
GOVERNMENT BAR FIRED THAN

01:45:02.129 --> 01:45:03.230
ANYONE WOULD HAVE ANTICIPATED

01:45:03.296 --> 01:45:06.199
AND I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE THAT

01:45:06.266 --> 01:45:08.135
OUT JERRY. TO PUT IN PLACE THE

01:45:08.201 --> 01:45:10.270

VERSUS PASSING A BILL THAT HAS

01:45:18.845 --> 01:45:21.348
BEEN. ADDED WITH ALL OF THE

01:45:21.415 --> 01:45:22.449

CAN ALL CONCUR THAT THIS IS- A

01:45:36.763 --> 01:45:37.931
BILL THAT HAS PROVIDED SOME

01:45:37.998 --> 01:45:41.101
VERY GOOD- DEBATE- I'D LIKE TO

01:45:41.168 --> 01:45:43.704
FOCUS ON PROPERTY RIGHTS- I WAS

01:45:43.770 --> 01:45:45.005
CHALLENGE YESTERDAY WITH THE

01:45:45.072 --> 01:45:46.606
QUESTION OF WHAT IS THE

01:45:46.673 --> 01:45:48.942
CONSERVATIVE VIEW OF. BUILDING

01:45:49.009 --> 01:45:51.044
HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA AND- WE

01:45:51.111 --> 01:45:52.412
ALWAYS SAY WELL IT'S A MATTER

01:45:52.479 --> 01:45:54.614
SUPPLY WE SHOULD. LET THE

01:45:54.681 --> 01:45:58.785
MARKET PROVIDE. A SUPPLY FOR

01:45:58.852 --> 01:46:01.054
THOSE IN THE MARKETPLACE. SO IT

01:46:01.121 --> 01:46:02.122
BROUGHT UP ALL KINDS OF

01:46:02.189 --> 01:46:04.357
QUESTIONS ONE. SHOULD CERTAIN

01:46:04.424 --> 01:46:07.360
REAL PROPERTY LOCATIONS BE

01:46:07.427 --> 01:46:07.928
REPURPOSE FOR HIGHER DENSITY

01:46:07.994 --> 01:46:10.497
HOUSING. IS THIS A FREE MARKET

01:46:10.564 --> 01:46:13.033
OPPORTUNITY HAVE CITIES BEEN

01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:14.901
TOO RESTRICTIVE IN THEIR ZONING

01:46:14.968 --> 01:46:16.570
OR HAS CALIFORNIA BEEN THE

01:46:16.636 --> 01:46:17.571
STRANGLEHOLD WITH THE

01:46:17.637 --> 01:46:18.805
CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL

01:46:18.872 --> 01:46:20.507
QUALITY ACT ARE ALSO KNOWN AS

01:46:20.574 --> 01:46:22.309
C. QUIRK. WORSE YET IN MY

01:46:22.375 --> 01:46:24.544
DISTRICT BEING COASTAL HAS THE

01:46:24.611 --> 01:46:25.879
CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION

01:46:25.946 --> 01:46:27.748
MAY BUILDING NEW HOUSING LESS

01:46:27.814 --> 01:46:29.516
THAN A BREAK EVEN BUSINESS

01:46:29.583 --> 01:46:32.919
PROPOSITION I HAVE ONE PROJECT

01:46:32.986 --> 01:46:34.721
IN WEALTH STILL MY DISTRICT. IF

01:46:34.788 --> 01:46:35.922
THEY WERE TRYING TO BUILD

01:46:35.989 --> 01:46:38.024
HOUSING THE ENTIRE EIGHT YEARS

01:46:38.091 --> 01:46:40.327
I WAS A SUPERVISOR. AND FIVE

01:46:40.393 --> 01:46:41.795
YEARS LATER THEY'RE STILL NOT

01:46:41.862 --> 01:46:44.197
ANY CLOSER. TO HAVE BEEN BUILT

01:46:44.264 --> 01:46:46.733
ONE. STRUCTURE ON A PIECE OF

01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:49.469
PROPERTY- SO ARE WE- IN THE WAY

01:46:49.536 --> 01:46:51.171
OF ALLOWING THE MARKET TO

01:46:51.238 --> 01:46:54.841
PROVIDE HOUSING. COLLEAGUES I

01:46:54.908 --> 01:46:56.376
HAVE GONE OUT OF MY COMFORT

01:46:56.443 --> 01:46:59.446
ZONE TO BE A CO AUTHOR OF SB

01:46:59.513 --> 01:47:00.981
FIFTY THIS IS BEEN AN

01:47:01.047 --> 01:47:01.548
INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE FOR ME

01:47:01.615 --> 01:47:05.418
AND I HAVE A LOT OF GOOD

01:47:05.485 --> 01:47:07.354
DISCUSSIONS BECAUSE I STRONGLY

01:47:07.420 --> 01:47:11.057
BELIEVE IN LOCAL CONTROL. AND

01:47:11.124 --> 01:47:12.192
SO I'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH THE

01:47:12.259 --> 01:47:15.495
DEBATE OF WHAT IS LOCAL CONTROL.

01:47:15.562 --> 01:47:18.865
SHOULD IT BE THE LANDOWNER.

01:47:18.932 --> 01:47:20.534
SHOULD BE THE CITY COUNCIL THAT

01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:22.903
HAS MORE CONTROL OR SHOULD IT

01:47:22.969 --> 01:47:25.505
BE SACRAMENTO THAT HAS MORE

01:47:25.572 --> 01:47:28.642
CONTROL AND SB FIFTY BROACHES

01:47:28.708 --> 01:47:31.511
THESE THEMES. WE HAVE A HOUSING

01:47:31.578 --> 01:47:34.181
CRISIS ALL AGREED BUT I BELIEVE

01:47:34.247 --> 01:47:36.082
IT'S BEEN SELF INFLICTED BY THE

01:47:36.149 --> 01:47:39.719
THIS INSTITUTION. BY THIS BODY

01:47:39.786 --> 01:47:42.189
OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE. PASSED

01:47:42.255 --> 01:47:43.990
BILLS THAT HAVE MADE IT VERY

01:47:44.057 --> 01:47:46.626
DIFFICULT FOR WELL MEANING

01:47:46.693 --> 01:47:48.728
DEVELOPERS AND ANY AND HERE WE

01:47:48.795 --> 01:47:56.837
ARE SO. IS THIS THE BEST BILL

01:47:56.903 --> 01:48:01.041
TO DO IT. NOW PROBABLY NOT IT

01:48:01.107 --> 01:48:03.076
GOES AFTER EVERY CITY BUT WITH

01:48:03.143 --> 01:48:05.512
LIMITED CARVE OUT AND I PREFER

01:48:05.579 --> 01:48:07.080
A BETTER NO BETTER NO WORSE

01:48:07.147 --> 01:48:09.716
APPROACH AND I HOPE AS IT GOES

01:48:09.783 --> 01:48:11.017
TO THE ASSEMBLY BUT SHOULD-

01:48:11.084 --> 01:48:12.118
THAT THEY MODIFY THE BILL TO

01:48:12.185 --> 01:48:13.253
LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD AND I

01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:14.888
WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR

01:48:14.955 --> 01:48:16.690
THE MANY AMENDMENTS. SOME

01:48:16.756 --> 01:48:19.392
CITIES ARE DOING WHAT WE WANT

01:48:19.459 --> 01:48:20.861
TO BAIT SO WE NEED TO FIGURE

01:48:20.927 --> 01:48:22.963
OUT HOW TO ENCOURAGE THESE THAT

01:48:23.029 --> 01:48:25.031
HAVE BEEN ADDING NEW HOUSING AT

01:48:25.098 --> 01:48:27.100
THE LIBERTY OF FASHION AND

01:48:27.167 --> 01:48:29.035
MAYBE GO A LITTLE STRONGER ON

01:48:29.102 --> 01:48:31.571
THE BAD ACTORS I THINK THE BILL

01:48:31.638 --> 01:48:32.873
ALSO NEEDS TO MORE CLEARLY

01:48:32.939 --> 01:48:36.243
DEFINED JOB RICH AREAS I AND

01:48:36.309 --> 01:48:38.011
BOUNDARIES AND I THINK

01:48:38.078 --> 01:48:40.180
UNLIMITED DENSITY IS OPAQUE AND

01:48:40.247 --> 01:48:42.048
THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED

01:48:42.115 --> 01:48:43.149
ABOUT THIS COULD BE REFINED

01:48:43.216 --> 01:48:44.851
GOING FORWARD. PARKING

01:48:44.918 --> 01:48:46.052
LIMITATIONS NEED MORE

01:48:46.119 --> 01:48:47.888
CLARIFICATION IS THE RULE OF

01:48:47.954 --> 01:48:50.156
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WHICH

01:48:50.223 --> 01:48:51.157
HAS ALREADY BEEN REFERRED TO

01:48:51.224 --> 01:48:52.425
SHOULD NOT COME INTO PLAY TO

01:48:52.492 --> 01:48:54.194
CREATE EVEN MORE PROBLEMS FOR

01:48:54.261 --> 01:48:57.797
OUR COMMUNITIES I THINK A

01:48:57.864 --> 01:48:58.398
SERIOUS REVIEW ALSO SHOULD BE

01:48:58.465 --> 01:49:02.068
DONE. ON PUBLIC TRANSIT. IT IT

01:49:02.135 --> 01:49:04.771
USAGE IS DECLINING AND WHEN AN

01:49:04.838 --> 01:49:06.840
ORANGE COUNTY WHEN WE RAISE OUR

01:49:06.907 --> 01:49:08.174
RATES BECAUSE YOU CAN ONLY

01:49:08.241 --> 01:49:10.176
SUBSIDIZE 80% OF THE COST OF

01:49:10.243 --> 01:49:11.945
PROVIDING A BUS FLEET THAT WHEN

01:49:12.012 --> 01:49:13.013
YOU RAISE THE RATES THE

01:49:13.079 --> 01:49:14.681
RIDERSHIP GOES DOWN AND IT GETS

01:49:14.748 --> 01:49:16.283
CIRCULAR YOU KNOW THEN YOU GOT

01:49:16.349 --> 01:49:17.484
TO RAISE IT AGAIN AND THEN IT

01:49:17.550 --> 01:49:19.052
JUST IT JUST GETS ALL BENT OUT

01:49:19.119 --> 01:49:20.487
OF SHAPE SO I THINK THIS

01:49:20.553 --> 01:49:22.222
VICIOUS CYCLE WE NEED TO TAKE A

01:49:22.289 --> 01:49:24.858
SERIOUS LOOK. AT MASS TRANSIT

01:49:24.925 --> 01:49:27.427
BECAUSE CALIFORNIA HAS FAILED

01:49:27.494 --> 01:49:29.496
TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR CARS.

01:49:29.562 --> 01:49:31.965
BECAUSE THE CARS ARE DEPENDABLE.

01:49:32.032 --> 01:49:34.467
EN MASS TRANSIT IS NOT AND SO

01:49:34.534 --> 01:49:37.470
WE SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED THAT

01:49:37.537 --> 01:49:39.105
THAT THAT'S THE CASE AND SO

01:49:39.172 --> 01:49:41.875
THAT NEEDS A HARD LOOK SB FIFTY

01:49:41.942 --> 01:49:43.343
SHOULD CAUSE US TO REFLECT ON

01:49:43.410 --> 01:49:44.844
THE GRAND SCHEME WHICH HAS BEEN

01:49:44.911 --> 01:49:45.745
MENTIONED BY SEVERAL OF OUR

01:49:45.812 --> 01:49:47.480
COLLEAGUES WHAT'S IN PLACE NOW

01:49:47.547 --> 01:49:49.616
IS NOT WORKING OPTIMALLY AND

01:49:49.683 --> 01:49:51.685
MAY BECOME EVEN GREATER SINK

01:49:51.751 --> 01:49:53.720
HOLES IN THE FUTURE AS OUR

01:49:53.787 --> 01:49:55.722
TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES.

01:49:55.789 --> 01:49:56.990
LITERALLY GO BANKRUPT TRYING TO

01:49:57.057 --> 01:49:58.458
DO SOMETHING THAT IS NOT

01:49:58.525 --> 01:50:00.727
WORKING INTEGRATION WITH SCHOOL

01:50:00.794 --> 01:50:02.929
DISTRICTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED

01:50:02.996 --> 01:50:04.331
GUESS CAPACITY NEEDS TO BE

01:50:04.397 --> 01:50:06.967
INCLUDED IN THE DISCUSSION MORE

01:50:07.033 --> 01:50:08.468
HOUSING EQUALS MORE CHILDREN.

01:50:08.535 --> 01:50:09.736
FOR CITIES THAT HAVE BEEN

01:50:09.803 --> 01:50:11.838
PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN

01:50:11.905 --> 01:50:12.939
HOMELESS SHELTERS. THEY SHOULD

01:50:13.006 --> 01:50:14.641
BE REWARDED WITH SOME KIND OF

01:50:14.708 --> 01:50:16.910
OFFSETS- IN THAT PROVIDE SOME

01:50:16.977 --> 01:50:19.546
KIND OF BALANCE. AFTER DECADES

01:50:19.612 --> 01:50:22.082
OF BENIGN NEGLECT SB FIFTY

01:50:22.148 --> 01:50:23.783
PROVIDES A MASSIVE CULTURAL

01:50:23.850 --> 01:50:27.120
CHANGE. THIS GROUND SHAKING WAS

01:50:27.187 --> 01:50:29.356
PROBABLY LONG IN COMING. BUT

01:50:29.422 --> 01:50:30.724
THE REVERBERATIONS ARE

01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:32.759
DISTURBING THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN

01:50:32.826 --> 01:50:35.061
PROACTIVE IN THEIR LAND

01:50:35.128 --> 01:50:35.595
PLANNING AND GENERAL PLAN

01:50:35.662 --> 01:50:37.564
IMPLEMENTATIONS. CALIFORNIA

01:50:37.630 --> 01:50:38.631
MADE SOME SHAKING UP MADAM

01:50:38.698 --> 01:50:42.535
PRESIDENT. AT ALL LEVELS HERE

01:50:42.602 --> 01:50:44.471
AND DOWN TO THE CITY LEVEL I

01:50:44.537 --> 01:50:46.806
BELIEVE DISCUSSION MUST BE HAD

01:50:46.873 --> 01:50:49.676
AND MUST BE CONTINUED. BUT IT

01:50:49.743 --> 01:50:51.978
SHOULD BE BY A STRONG VOTE

01:50:52.045 --> 01:50:52.579
MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU VERY

01:50:52.645 --> 01:50:59.552
MUCH. SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU

01:50:59.619 --> 01:51:02.856
MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS. I

01:51:02.922 --> 01:51:03.990
DON'T WANT TO REITERATE WHAT

01:51:04.057 --> 01:51:06.026
EVERYONE HERE SAD BUT THE ONE

01:51:06.092 --> 01:51:08.061
THING I DO KNOW IS THAT I

01:51:08.128 --> 01:51:09.696
BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE IS RIGHT

01:51:09.763 --> 01:51:11.264
DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY COME

01:51:11.331 --> 01:51:14.768
FROM WE ARE CAST OUT BY NóI IN

01:51:14.834 --> 01:51:15.668
OUR OWN COMMUNITIES AND WHAT

01:51:15.735 --> 01:51:18.204
THE NEEDS ARE. AND I THINK IT

01:51:18.271 --> 01:51:19.773
REALLY DOES BLOW IT BOILED DOWN

01:51:19.839 --> 01:51:21.708
TO OUR OWN COMMUNITIES

01:51:21.775 --> 01:51:24.044
ECONOMICS DEMOGRAPHICS

01:51:24.110 --> 01:51:25.578
EVERYTHING THAT THAT REALLY

01:51:25.645 --> 01:51:28.715
SHAPES OUR OWN AREAS FOR

01:51:28.782 --> 01:51:32.118
EXAMPLE. I WANT TO ALSO AGREE

01:51:32.185 --> 01:51:33.286
WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM LOS

01:51:33.353 --> 01:51:37.390
ANGELES BOTH OF THEM THAT- IN

01:51:37.457 --> 01:51:40.493
OUR AREA LOS ANGELES COUNTY

01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:43.263
THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY PEOPLE

01:51:43.329 --> 01:51:45.799
THAT HAVE JUST PLEASE IN MY- IN

01:51:45.865 --> 01:51:48.134
THE COMMUNITY. CORRUPT IN. HOME

01:51:48.201 --> 01:51:49.569
ARE OVER HOUSING IS OVER A

01:51:49.636 --> 01:51:51.738
MILLION DOLLARS I COULD NEVER

01:51:51.805 --> 01:51:55.008
AFFORD THAT WE WERE DISPLACED

01:51:55.075 --> 01:51:57.577
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I

01:51:57.644 --> 01:51:59.979
TAKE VERY PERSONALLY OUR FIRST

01:52:00.046 --> 01:52:01.281
I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR

01:52:01.347 --> 01:52:02.449
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT HE'S BEEN

01:52:02.515 --> 01:52:03.316
WORKING REALLY HARD ON THIS

01:52:03.383 --> 01:52:05.885
ISSUE AND TAKEN A LOT OF TME

01:52:05.952 --> 01:52:07.821
TO LISTEN TO OUR CONCERNS AND

01:52:07.887 --> 01:52:09.622
TRY TO SOLVE OUR CONCERNS. THIS

01:52:09.689 --> 01:52:11.658
LAST WEEK I GATHERED MY TEEN

01:52:11.724 --> 01:52:15.495
CITIES TO HEAR HIS CONCERNS AND

01:52:15.562 --> 01:52:16.996
HE TOOK THE TIME TO ANSWER EACH

01:52:17.063 --> 01:52:19.099
AND EVERYONE OTHER QUESTIONS

01:52:19.165 --> 01:52:20.467
AND SO I BELIEVE THAT THAT HE

01:52:20.533 --> 01:52:22.435
IS STATE TO TRY MAKE THIS BILL

01:52:22.502 --> 01:52:27.073
BETTER. TO TRY TO HELP OUT BUT-

01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:28.074
IN MY COMMUNITY LAST YEAR I

01:52:28.141 --> 01:52:30.810
PASSED HOUSING. AND I PROMISE

01:52:30.877 --> 01:52:32.345
MY COMMUNITIES THAT IF THEY

01:52:32.412 --> 01:52:34.547
CAME TO THE TABLE AND HELP ME

01:52:34.614 --> 01:52:36.783
SOLVE THE HOUSING CRISIS. THAT

01:52:36.850 --> 01:52:39.119
WE COULD DO THIS. TOGETHER

01:52:39.185 --> 01:52:40.520
BASED ON OUR OWN CIRCUMSTANCE

01:52:40.587 --> 01:52:40.987
AND BASED ON OUR OWN

01:52:41.054 --> 01:52:43.356
COMMUNITIES AND THE DATE THAT I

01:52:43.423 --> 01:52:45.258
PASSED THE BILL LAST YEAR. AND

01:52:45.325 --> 01:52:47.360
WE ARE ACTIVELY CRATE ACTIVELY

01:52:47.427 --> 01:52:48.995
ENGAGED ON WHAT THAT'S GOING TO

01:52:49.062 --> 01:52:51.498
LOOK LIKE SO I CAN PROVIDE

01:52:51.564 --> 01:52:53.266
SUPPORT FOR BUILDING HOMES.

01:52:53.333 --> 01:52:55.635
PARTICULAR LOW INCOME HOUSING

01:52:55.702 --> 01:52:56.903
BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:52:56.970 --> 01:52:58.471
I DISCUSSED EARLIER IS THAT LOW

01:52:58.538 --> 01:53:00.573
INCOME AFFORDABILITY MEANS

01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:01.574
DIFFERENT THINGS TO DIFFERENT

01:53:01.641 --> 01:53:03.643
PEOPLE. THE AVERAGE INCOME IN

01:53:03.710 --> 01:53:05.979
ONE OF MY COMMUNITY SAYS FORTY

01:53:06.045 --> 01:53:08.848
SEVEN THOUSAND. LOS ANGELES I

01:53:08.915 --> 01:53:09.582
BELIEVE IT'S SIXTY FOUR

01:53:09.649 --> 01:53:12.385
THOUSAND. CALIFORNIA OVER

01:53:12.452 --> 01:53:14.220
SEVENTY THOUSAND. SO EVERYONE

01:53:14.287 --> 01:53:16.523
HAS A DIFFERENT PERCEPTION OF

01:53:16.589 --> 01:53:17.056
WHAT THAT MEANS AND IN MY

01:53:17.123 --> 01:53:19.526
COMMUNITY. IT'S REALLY THE FEAR

01:53:19.592 --> 01:53:21.528
THAT- MY COLLEAGUES ON THE

01:53:21.594 --> 01:53:23.429
SANTA LEAST TALKED ABOUT. HOW

01:53:23.496 --> 01:53:24.764
DO WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE NOT

01:53:24.831 --> 01:53:26.332
GONNA GET DOES PLEASE I DON'T

01:53:26.399 --> 01:53:29.035
BELIEVE THAT IF ONE SIZE FITS

01:53:29.102 --> 01:53:30.403
ALL I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WHEN

01:53:30.470 --> 01:53:32.505
WE BUILD HOUSES. IT'S GOING TO

01:53:32.572 --> 01:53:34.107
MEAN THE SAME THING FOR

01:53:34.174 --> 01:53:36.276
EVERYONE. AND IN MY COMMUNITIES

01:53:36.342 --> 01:53:37.377
ONLY TAKE THE TIME TO TALK

01:53:37.443 --> 01:53:39.145
ABOUT THE CITIES WE'VE BEEN

01:53:39.212 --> 01:53:40.613
HEARING OFTEN OVER AND OVER

01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:41.414
AGAIN THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO

01:53:41.481 --> 01:53:42.248
HELP IN THAT WANT TO

01:53:42.315 --> 01:53:43.883
PARTICIPATE IN THE NEED TO COME

01:53:43.950 --> 01:53:45.985

THE HOUSING TRUST AND THEY'RE

01:53:53.126 --> 01:53:54.794
ACTIVELY PUTTING FUNDING NOT

01:53:54.861 --> 01:53:56.429
TRUST TO TRY AND SOLVE THE

01:53:56.496 --> 01:53:59.933
HOUSING CRISIS. SO FOR ME- NOT

01:53:59.999 --> 01:54:02.268

CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS. BUT

01:54:10.977 --> 01:54:12.879
AFTER MEETING WITH THE WITH THE

01:54:12.946 --> 01:54:15.615

JUST HAD THIS POINT I NEED TO.

01:54:24.190 --> 01:54:25.491
WORK WITH MY COMMUNITY SINCE

01:54:25.558 --> 01:54:26.960
THE POWER HAS. BEEN TOUCHED

01:54:36.869 --> 01:54:39.839
CENTER FOR MOST. WE ALL COME

01:54:39.906 --> 01:54:41.007
FROM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES WE

01:54:41.074 --> 01:54:42.408
ALL DIFFERENT PRIORITIES

01:54:42.475 --> 01:54:43.576
DIFFERENT SENSIBILITIES

01:54:43.643 --> 01:54:47.146
DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHICS AND NOT

01:54:47.213 --> 01:54:47.680
ONE IS MORE RIGHT THAN THE

01:54:47.747 --> 01:54:50.383
OTHER. AND I THINK THIS IS A

01:54:50.450 --> 01:54:53.419
FANTASTIC EXAMPLE OF DEMOCRACY

01:54:53.486 --> 01:54:55.355
IN ACTION IN THE PUREST FORM.

01:54:55.421 --> 01:54:58.358
WE AVE ONE PARTY SPLIT THE

01:54:58.424 --> 01:55:00.960
OTHER FRACTURED AS WELL. AND TO

01:55:01.027 --> 01:55:02.328
ME I THINK THIS IS A FANTASTIC

01:55:02.395 --> 01:55:04.964
IDEA THAT WE HAVE THE

01:55:05.031 --> 01:55:07.000
OPPORTUNITY DEBATE AN ISSUE ON

01:55:07.066 --> 01:55:09.469
THE MERITS AN INTERNIST SO I'D

01:55:09.535 --> 01:55:11.271
LIKE TAKE VENGEANCE OPPORTUNITY

IN COMMAND TO THE CENTER FROM

01:55:13.439 --> 01:55:15.642
LOS FROM MY SAN FRANCISCO. FOR

01:55:15.708 --> 01:55:17.310
MEETING WITH ME TALKING WITH ME

01:55:17.377 --> 01:55:18.711
MEETING FRANKLY WITH EVERYBODY

01:55:18.778 --> 01:55:19.979
AND BEING OPEN TO THE

01:55:20.046 --> 01:55:21.948
AMENDMENTS TO TRY TO MAKE THIS

01:55:22.015 --> 01:55:25.518
A BETTER PRODUCT. I DON'T THINK

01:55:25.585 --> 01:55:28.521
WE'RE THERE YET. AND I WANT TO

01:55:28.588 --> 01:55:29.956
I WANT TO GET AT LEAST EXPLAIN

01:55:30.023 --> 01:55:33.326
JUST A LITTLE BIT ON WINE. SO

01:55:33.393 --> 01:55:35.061
THE CELTS WE HAVE A WE HAVE A

01:55:35.128 --> 01:55:37.463
SITUATION HERE WHERE WE HAVE A

01:55:37.530 --> 01:55:39.832
ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH. AND

01:55:39.899 --> 01:55:42.235
IN SOME INSTANCES I THINK THAT

01:55:42.302 --> 01:55:44.337
CAN WORK WHEN IT COMES TO

01:55:44.404 --> 01:55:46.172
HOUSING HOUSING AFFORDABILITY

01:55:46.239 --> 01:55:48.941
AND- AND POPULATION

01:55:49.008 --> 01:55:49.642
DISPLACEMENT IT CLEARLY

01:55:49.709 --> 01:55:51.778
DOESN'T. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:55:51.844 --> 01:55:54.213
I PUT FORWARD TO THE AUTHOR OF

01:55:54.280 --> 01:55:56.182
THIS PIECE LEGISLATION IS.

01:55:56.249 --> 01:55:57.617
MAYBE WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS A

01:55:57.684 --> 01:55:59.619
LITTLE BIT WRONG. MAYBE A

01:55:59.686 --> 01:56:01.654
BETTER APPROACH MIGHT BE TO

01:56:01.721 --> 01:56:03.356
LOOK UPON IT WITH THE

01:56:03.423 --> 01:56:06.192
CALCULATION RATIO. MEANING THAT

01:56:06.259 --> 01:56:08.194
THE AREAS THAT HAVE THE MOST

01:56:08.261 --> 01:56:10.396
HOUSING NEEDS BECAUSE NOT ALL

01:56:10.463 --> 01:56:11.764
PARTS OF CALIFORNIA ARE EQUAL

01:56:11.831 --> 01:56:13.366
IN THAT WERE IN THAT REGARD

01:56:13.433 --> 01:56:15.435
THAT WE HAVE A CALCULATION

01:56:15.501 --> 01:56:19.138
BASED RATIO. ON NEEDS THAT IS

01:56:19.205 --> 01:56:19.772
SOMETHING THAT I THINK COULD BE

01:56:19.839 --> 01:56:22.175
TERRIBLY HELPFUL- BUT NOW WE

01:56:22.241 --> 01:56:23.376
ARE WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW AT

01:56:23.443 --> 01:56:25.244
THE END OF A- THE CARRY OVER

01:56:25.311 --> 01:56:27.146
FROM LAST YEAR AND MOVING INTO

01:56:27.213 --> 01:56:29.048
THE NEW LEGISLATIVE CYCLE. I

01:56:29.115 --> 01:56:31.484
DON'T VIEW TODAY'S VOTE AS THE

01:56:31.551 --> 01:56:33.986
END OF THIS ISSUE IN FACT I

01:56:34.053 --> 01:56:34.954
BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD

01:56:35.021 --> 01:56:37.590
ENCOURAGE THIS TO BE SHOULD NOT

01:56:37.657 --> 01:56:39.225
PASSED TODAY AND I DON'T KNOW

01:56:39.292 --> 01:56:40.193
WHERE THE VOTES MAY MAY LIE ON

01:56:40.259 --> 01:56:42.095
THIS. BUT I'M HOPING THAT THE

01:56:42.161 --> 01:56:43.663
AUTHOR IF IT WERE NOT TO PASSED

01:56:43.730 --> 01:56:46.799
TODAY SIMPLY REINTRODUCE IT SO

01:56:46.866 --> 01:56:49.769
THAT WE CAN AGAIN- BRING IN

01:56:49.836 --> 01:56:51.871
MORE STAKEHOLDERS AND I THINK

01:56:51.938 --> 01:56:55.074
GET A CLOSER LOOK AT WHAT OTHER

01:56:55.141 --> 01:56:56.376
OPTIONS MIGHT EXIST. FROM THE

01:56:56.442 --> 01:56:58.378
VALLEY PERSPECTIVE I REPRESENT

01:56:58.444 --> 01:56:59.846
THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND REBEKAH

01:56:59.912 --> 01:57:02.248
REPRESENT ELEVEN COUNTIES. NOW

01:57:02.315 --> 01:57:04.484
THE COUNTIES UP NORTH. DON'T

01:57:04.550 --> 01:57:06.519
SEEM TO BE AS A AS AFFECTED AS

01:57:06.586 --> 01:57:08.688
THE COUNTIES. IN THE SELF. AND

01:57:08.755 --> 01:57:09.756
SO I HAVE ALL SORTS OF

01:57:09.822 --> 01:57:11.290
DIFFERENT- PEOPLE TALKING TO

01:57:11.357 --> 01:57:12.692
MIGHT YEAR OVER THE LAST.

01:57:12.759 --> 01:57:14.260
NUMBER OF WEEKS ON WHAT THEY

01:57:14.327 --> 01:57:16.929
WOULD LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN. THERE

01:57:16.996 --> 01:57:18.765
IS NO CONCURRENCE. THE ONLY

01:57:18.831 --> 01:57:20.867
THING THAT. FOLKS AGREE ON IS

01:57:20.933 --> 01:57:23.169
THAT WE NEED HOUSING. HOW WE

01:57:23.236 --> 01:57:25.004
GET THERE EVERYONE HAS A

01:57:25.071 --> 01:57:26.406
DIFFERENT HAS A DIFFERENT

01:57:26.472 --> 01:57:29.041
THEORY. AND ALL. TO BE FAIR TO

01:57:29.108 --> 01:57:30.510
THE FOLKS THAT I REPRESENT I

01:57:30.576 --> 01:57:31.878
REACH OUT TO A NUMBER OF

01:57:31.944 --> 01:57:33.980
COMMUNITIES IN MY DISTRICT. AND

01:57:34.046 --> 01:57:36.649
I RECEIVED- WAS REALLY GOT THE

01:57:36.716 --> 01:57:38.084
LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES

01:57:38.151 --> 01:57:40.620
OPPOSITION TO THIS. I GOT CITY

01:57:40.686 --> 01:57:42.922
OF CLOVIS IS OPPOSITION TO THIS

01:57:42.989 --> 01:57:47.126
AND- MY FORMER. POLITICAL

01:57:47.193 --> 01:57:49.462
POSITION. IN MY FOR POLITICAL

01:57:49.529 --> 01:57:50.763
POSITION I GOT A LETTER FROM

01:57:50.830 --> 01:57:52.165
THE FOR FROM FRESNO COUNTING IN

01:57:52.231 --> 01:57:54.567
OPPOSITION TO THIS. SO THAT

01:57:54.634 --> 01:57:55.902
PUTS ME IN A PRETTY INTERESTING

01:57:55.968 --> 01:57:58.504
SITUATION WHERE- SO MY LARGEST

01:57:58.571 --> 01:58:00.239
CONSTITUENCIES ARE OPPOSED TO

01:58:00.306 --> 01:58:04.477
THIS. AND I HAVE TO ASK WHY. NO

01:58:04.544 --> 01:58:06.879
I DON'T ALWAYS AGREE WITH WHAT

01:58:06.946 --> 01:58:07.847
THE ANSWERS THAT I'VE BEEN

01:58:07.914 --> 01:58:09.682
GIVEN IN FACT I THINK THERE IS

01:58:09.749 --> 01:58:12.385
IMPERATIVE THAT WE MUST PURSUE

01:58:12.452 --> 01:58:14.353
BUT ONE GLARING REALITY IS

01:58:14.420 --> 01:58:17.990
THAT. ANY IMPOSITION ON IN IN

01:58:18.057 --> 01:58:20.793
THE HOUSING REALM WILL EXPAND

01:58:20.860 --> 01:58:22.695
ELSEWHERE INTO THE NEIGHBORING

01:58:22.762 --> 01:58:23.329
COUNTIES THE NEIGHBORING

01:58:23.396 --> 01:58:25.765
COMMUNITIES US NOT ACTUALLY

01:58:25.832 --> 01:58:27.900
ACCOMPLISHING WHAT NEEDS TO BE

01:58:27.967 --> 01:58:30.470
DONE SO MY POINT IN ALL THIS IS

01:58:30.536 --> 01:58:34.006
THAT. I WOULD LIKE THIS TO

01:58:34.073 --> 01:58:35.875
CONTINUE TO BE RE INTRODUCE. AS

01:58:35.942 --> 01:58:38.377
SOON AS TOMORROW IT SHOULD IT

01:58:38.444 --> 01:58:40.813
NOT PASSED TODAY SO THAT WE CAN

01:58:40.880 --> 01:58:42.648
LOOK AT WHAT WHATEVER.

01:58:42.715 --> 01:58:45.918
CALCULATION CAN BE ALLOWED WITH

01:58:45.985 --> 01:58:48.054
THIS TYPE OF ONE SIZE FITS ALL

01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:49.388
BECAUSE THIS NOTION OF LOCAL

01:58:49.455 --> 01:58:52.992
CONTROL. IS LOCAL CONTROL IF

01:58:53.059 --> 01:58:55.795
YOU IT HERE AND AGREE WITH

01:58:55.862 --> 01:58:58.064
WITH- SACRAMENTO'S VISION. AND

01:58:58.130 --> 01:58:59.899
THAT'S MY PROBLEM IS I DON'T

01:58:59.966 --> 01:59:02.835
THINK THE LOCAL CONTROL IS TRUE

01:59:02.902 --> 01:59:05.271
BUT IT CAN BE AND I WANT TO BE

01:59:05.338 --> 01:59:06.939
SUPPORTIVE AND I THINK- THE

01:59:07.006 --> 01:59:08.307
CENTER FROM SAN FRANCISCO'S

01:59:08.374 --> 01:59:10.076
DONE AN EXEMPLARY JOB OF

01:59:10.142 --> 01:59:11.944
PUSHING THIS ISSUE. I WON IT

01:59:12.011 --> 01:59:13.713
PUSHED EVEN FURTHER AND I

01:59:13.779 --> 01:59:16.949
BELIEVE THAT ALL THE FOLKS THAT

01:59:17.016 --> 01:59:19.151
ARE BEHIND THIS. THE FOLKS IN

01:59:19.218 --> 01:59:21.120
THE INDUSTRY. IN THE WE CANNOT

01:59:21.187 --> 01:59:22.622
AFFORD ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK I

01:59:22.688 --> 01:59:25.992
THINK WE'RE ALMOST THERE I JUST

01:59:26.058 --> 01:59:27.894
DON'T THINK WE'RE THERE YET.

01:59:27.960 --> 01:59:31.464

01:59:38.571 --> 01:59:39.839
MEETING WOULD PROBABLY ALL OF

01:59:39.906 --> 01:59:42.275
HIS COLLEAGUES AND TRYING TO

01:59:42.341 --> 01:59:45.778

01:59:49.782 --> 01:59:51.717
HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:59:51.784 --> 01:59:53.586
AFFORDABILITY CRISIS HERE IN

01:59:53.653 --> 01:59:55.187
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IN

01:59:55.254 --> 01:59:56.389
MANY WAYS A SOME OF MY

01:59:56.455 --> 01:59:58.491
COLLEAGUES HAVE STATED A-

01:59:58.558 --> 02:00:01.827
CRISIS THAT WAS. EXACERBATED BY

02:00:01.894 --> 02:00:02.895
FOLKS LIKE MYSELF IN THE

02:00:02.962 --> 02:00:05.798
LEGISLATURE WHO VOTED AND- NINE

02:00:05.865 --> 02:00:07.833
YEARS AGO IN REDEVELOPMENT A

02:00:07.900 --> 02:00:10.736
TOOL THAT HOPED TO BUILD REAL

02:00:10.803 --> 02:00:13.639
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN MY

02:00:13.706 --> 02:00:14.206
CHALLENGE WITH THIS BILL IS

02:00:14.273 --> 02:00:16.876
THAT. AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS

02:00:16.943 --> 02:00:19.579
REALLY NOT BEING BUILT HERE THE

02:00:19.645 --> 02:00:22.348
END INTENT IS THERE BUT THE

02:00:22.415 --> 02:00:24.083
MECHANISM OF HOW DO WE GET

02:00:24.150 --> 02:00:26.018
THERE THAT'S MY BIGGEST CONCERN

02:00:26.085 --> 02:00:28.154
BECAUSE IT IS ABOUT

02:00:28.220 --> 02:00:30.056
AFFORDABILITY I'VE TALKED TO.

02:00:30.122 --> 02:00:32.158
WORKING FOLKS PEOPLE WHO MAKE A

02:00:32.224 --> 02:00:33.593
HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE

02:00:33.659 --> 02:00:34.860
THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR IN NAY

02:00:34.927 --> 02:00:38.097
STEEL CAN AFFORD TO BUY A HOUSE

02:00:38.164 --> 02:00:40.866
IN CALIFORNIA I TALKED TO ONE

02:00:40.933 --> 02:00:42.034

WORST HOUSE ON THE BEST BLOCK.

ZONING ZONING IT'S WHAT I LIKE

THE MOST ABOUT THIS BILL

02:01:02.822 --> 02:01:04.757
BECAUSE THE SENATORS RIDER WE

EVERY COMMUNITY A COUNTY IS

THE LOCAL LEVEL BECAUSE YOU

MADAM PRESIDENT I WAS ONE IF I

OBJECTION. THANK YOU UGH TEN A

02:04:19.151 --> 02:04:20.686
THAT IS A BIG CONCERN TO ME AND

02:04:20.753 --> 02:04:22.121
I THINK IT IS A CONCERN TO

02:04:22.188 --> 02:04:23.722
OTHERS I THINK THAT THE TEN A

02:04:23.789 --> 02:04:25.324
PROTECTIONS THAT WE HAVE NOW

02:04:25.391 --> 02:04:27.293
UNDER STATE LAW ALLOW

02:04:27.359 --> 02:04:29.862
DEVELOPERS TO COME IN UNDER THE

02:04:29.929 --> 02:04:32.064
ELLIS ACT IN JUST BULLDOZE-

02:04:32.131 --> 02:04:34.867
OKAY A DEVELOPMENT AND BUILD

02:04:34.934 --> 02:04:39.205
WILL THIS BILL HELPS THAT IS IT

02:04:39.271 --> 02:04:40.639
BETTER IS IT STRONGER OR NOT. I

02:04:40.706 --> 02:04:43.242
SURE- THROUGH THE PRESIDENT I

02:04:43.309 --> 02:04:46.345
THANK YOU AS CENTER FOR THAT- A

02:04:46.412 --> 02:04:48.247
QUESTION- I TOUCHED ON THIS

02:04:48.314 --> 02:04:49.515
EARLIER BUT I WANT TO REITERATE

02:04:49.582 --> 02:04:50.916
BECAUSE EVER SINCE STATEMENTS

02:04:50.983 --> 02:04:52.818
MADE ABOUT- RENT TO PROTECTIONS

02:04:52.885 --> 02:04:56.255
ON SB FIFTY HAS THE STRONGEST

02:04:56.322 --> 02:04:57.656
RENTER PROTECTIONS IN EXISTENCE

02:04:57.723 --> 02:05:00.826
UNDER STATE LAW- IF A RENTER'S

02:05:00.893 --> 02:05:02.194
LIVED ON THE PROPERTY AT ANY

02:05:02.261 --> 02:05:03.696
POINT IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS

02:05:03.762 --> 02:05:05.297
OR OF AN ALICE ACTIVATION HAS

02:05:05.364 --> 02:05:07.032
HAPPENED AT ANY POINT IN THE

02:05:07.099 --> 02:05:09.101
LAST FIFTEEN YEARS YOU CANNOT

02:05:09.168 --> 02:05:11.136
DEMOLISH THE BUILDING FOR AN SB

02:05:11.203 --> 02:05:12.972
FIFTY- PROJECT. THIS IS

02:05:13.038 --> 02:05:15.274
STRONGER THAN THE VAST MAJORITY

02:05:15.341 --> 02:05:17.509
OF CITIES- HAVE IN TERMS OF

02:05:17.576 --> 02:05:19.245
PROTECTIONS STRONGER THE VAST

02:05:19.311 --> 02:05:21.313
MAJORITY CITIES IN CALIFORNIA I

02:05:21.380 --> 02:05:23.549
DO WANT TO- WHICH IS NO BECAUSE

02:05:23.616 --> 02:05:25.184
THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION

02:05:25.251 --> 02:05:27.186
ABOUT THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES-

02:05:27.253 --> 02:05:29.121
AND I WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT

02:05:29.188 --> 02:05:33.092
SPECIFIC TO THIS ISSUE THERE

02:05:33.158 --> 02:05:34.927
ARE OTHER ISSUES AS WELL. THESE

02:05:34.994 --> 02:05:36.328
RENTER PROTECT. THE DEMOLITION.

02:05:36.395 --> 02:05:38.697
SB ARE STRONGER THAN THE

02:05:38.764 --> 02:05:40.299
PROTECTIONS IN PLACE BY THE

02:05:40.366 --> 02:05:42.835
CITY OF LOS ANGELES STRONGER.

02:05:42.902 --> 02:05:44.403
SO I DON'T THINK IT'S ACCURATE

02:05:44.470 --> 02:05:47.339
TO SUGGEST THAT THIS BILL WILL

02:05:47.406 --> 02:05:48.173
SOMEHOW MAKE IT EASIER TO

02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:49.909
OBJECTS. TENANTS WERE

02:05:49.975 --> 02:05:51.810
DEMOLISHED BUILDINGS IN LOS

02:05:51.877 --> 02:05:53.545
ANGELES THIS WILL MAKE IT.

02:05:53.612 --> 02:05:56.749
HARDER BY IN ADDITION- I WILL

02:05:56.815 --> 02:05:58.851
NOTE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT- THE

02:05:58.918 --> 02:06:00.886
TRANSIT ORIENTED COMMUNITIES OR

02:06:00.953 --> 02:06:03.255
TOC PROGRAM IN LOS ANGELES

02:06:03.322 --> 02:06:04.690
WHERE IT WAS UP SO ON. HER

02:06:04.757 --> 02:06:06.191
VOTER INITIATIVE IT'S A

02:06:06.258 --> 02:06:07.159
MINORITY OF THE CITY

02:06:07.226 --> 02:06:08.994
GEOGRAPHICALLY BUT IT'S A VERY

02:06:09.061 --> 02:06:10.930
EXCELLENT EXCELLENT PROGRAM-

02:06:10.996 --> 02:06:12.531
AND IN FACT IT'S SO EXCELLENT

02:06:12.598 --> 02:06:15.701
AND SO ROBUST- DIE WE- IT'S

02:06:15.768 --> 02:06:17.536
EFFECTIVELY EXEMPTED FROM THIS

02:06:17.603 --> 02:06:19.371
BILL. BECAUSE IT ALLOWS

02:06:19.438 --> 02:06:20.839
ACTUALLY MORE OF ZONING THAT SB

02:06:20.906 --> 02:06:22.207
FIFTY DOLLARS AND SO IT'S NOT

02:06:22.274 --> 02:06:23.776
ACCURATE THAT THIS BILL WILL

02:06:23.842 --> 02:06:26.812
DELAY ANYTHING INTO YOUR SEE.

02:06:26.879 --> 02:06:29.281
AN ALLY. BY NOTE HOWEVER. THERE

02:06:29.348 --> 02:06:31.183
ARE APPARENTLY QUITE A FEW

02:06:31.250 --> 02:06:33.986
PROJECTS BUILT UNDER TOC IN LOS

02:06:34.053 --> 02:06:35.754
ANGELES. AT RESULTS FROM ELLIS

02:06:35.821 --> 02:06:38.223
OF BUILDING AND THEN TEARING IT

02:06:38.290 --> 02:06:40.726
DOWN TO BUILD A BIGGER BILL.

02:06:40.793 --> 02:06:43.329
I'M NOT EXISTING T. T. S. FIFTY

02:06:43.395 --> 02:06:46.966
WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT WE GO

02:06:47.032 --> 02:06:47.967
BEYOND. THOSE TEN PROTECTIONS.

02:06:48.033 --> 02:06:49.568
STRONG TO REDUCTIONS IN WITH

02:06:49.635 --> 02:06:51.136
THAT SAID WE ARE CONTINUING TO

02:06:51.203 --> 02:06:53.238
WORK WITH RENTS ARE ADVOCATES-

02:06:53.305 --> 02:06:54.606
TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS

02:06:54.673 --> 02:06:56.442
THERE TO SAY. AND I WILL JUST

02:06:56.508 --> 02:06:58.944
END BY SAYING. I SUPPORT THE

02:06:59.011 --> 02:07:00.746
RENT REGISTRY. THAT SOMEONE

02:07:00.813 --> 02:07:02.881
NUMBER WICKS AUTHORED IRISH'S

02:07:02.948 --> 02:07:06.251
REINTRODUCE. SHE'S THE PUBLIC I

02:07:06.318 --> 02:07:07.853
THOUGHT- JUMPING ON FOR HER I

02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:09.388
DON'T THINK IT'S INTO LAW I AND

02:07:09.455 --> 02:07:11.123
I'M ASSIST. THE BILL'S BECAUSE

02:07:11.190 --> 02:07:13.292
I WAS THE ME I AM COMMITTED TO

02:07:13.359 --> 02:07:13.892
THIS ISSUE AND I LOOK FORWARD

02:07:13.959 --> 02:07:15.794
TO WORKING ON A FURTHER. THANK

02:07:15.861 --> 02:07:16.795
YOU THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL TO

02:07:16.862 --> 02:07:17.830
HEAR THAT THE TEN A PROTECTIONS

02:07:17.896 --> 02:07:19.164
WOULD ACTUALLY BE STRONGER.

02:07:19.231 --> 02:07:22.368
UNDER SB FIFTY. OTHER QUESTION

02:07:22.434 --> 02:07:23.102
I HAVE IS ABOUT AFFORDABLE

02:07:23.168 --> 02:07:24.636
HOUSING I'VE HEARD A LOT OF

02:07:24.703 --> 02:07:26.438
THAT I THINK IT'S A HUGE

02:07:26.505 --> 02:07:27.072
CONCERN FOR EVERY SINGLE ONE OF

02:07:27.139 --> 02:07:29.708
US. ON THIS FLOOR I HAVE MET

02:07:29.775 --> 02:07:30.809
WITH THE VERBAL PURRS AND I'VE

02:07:30.876 --> 02:07:32.211
ASKED THEM WHY THEY DON'T

02:07:32.277 --> 02:07:36.215
DEVELOP MORE. AFFORDABLE

02:07:36.281 --> 02:07:39.618
HOUSING. AND THE WHOLE ME THAT

02:07:39.685 --> 02:07:40.719
THEY DO THEY DON'T IT'LL BE. UP

02:07:40.786 --> 02:07:42.354
MY ANY MONEY OFF OF IT. IN SB

SITE AFFORDABLE FOR TWENTY

02:10:09.868 --> 02:10:11.603
UNITS ARE MORE. BUT FOR A LEAD

02:10:11.670 --> 02:10:14.173
IN THE TWENTY UNITS- WOULD PAY

02:10:17.075 --> 02:10:18.043
CITY OF LOS ANGELES

02:10:18.110 --> 02:10:19.678
DRAMATICALLY IN TERMS OF

AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS IN

02:10:21.013 --> 02:10:23.215
THE LARGE MAJORITY OF THAT

02:10:23.282 --> 02:10:25.284
CITY- AND WILL INCREASE

02:10:25.350 --> 02:10:26.952
AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH IS WHY

02:10:27.019 --> 02:10:29.021
SO MANY NONPROFIT AFFORDABLE

02:10:29.087 --> 02:10:30.923

MANY. OF THEM ARE AND THEN

02:10:40.732 --> 02:10:42.768
FINALLY WE GOT A REQUEST FOR AN

02:10:42.834 --> 02:10:44.670
AMENDMENT FROM AN ORGANIZATION

02:10:44.736 --> 02:10:46.205
IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY

02:10:46.271 --> 02:10:47.506
CALLED THE QUEEN OF BEAUTIFUL

02:10:47.573 --> 02:10:49.641
AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GROUP-

02:10:49.708 --> 02:10:52.277

02:10:52.344 --> 02:10:53.078
OF THE AFFORDABLE UNITS

02:10:53.145 --> 02:10:54.846
PRODUCED UNDER THIS BILL. WOULD

02:10:54.913 --> 02:10:56.782
BE- PRIORITIZE FOR LOCAL

02:10:56.848 --> 02:10:57.749
RESIDENTS TO THE PEOPLE WHO

02:10:57.816 --> 02:10:59.585
LIVE IN A COMMUNITY CAN HAVE

02:10:59.651 --> 02:11:01.186
ACCESS TO WHAT'S BEING BUILT

02:11:01.253 --> 02:11:02.921
THERE WE MADE THAT AMENDMENT.

02:11:02.988 --> 02:11:04.089
40% OF THE UNITS THERE IS A

02:11:04.156 --> 02:11:05.791
PREFERENCE- FOR LOCAL

02:11:05.857 --> 02:11:07.893
RESIDENTS- AND I THINK THAT'S

02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:10.462
AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE- OF

02:11:10.529 --> 02:11:12.431
THE BILL SO THANK YOU. THANK

HELPFUL THANK YOU MADAM

02:11:13.532 --> 02:11:15.167
PRESIDENT. MEMBERS NONE OF US

02:11:15.234 --> 02:11:17.002
CAME HERE TO DO THE EASY WORK

02:11:17.069 --> 02:11:18.904
WE ALL CAME HERE TO DO THE HARD

02:11:18.971 --> 02:11:20.205
WORK AND I WOULD PUT THIS IN

02:11:20.272 --> 02:11:22.274
THE CATEGORY OF HARD WORK. I

02:11:22.341 --> 02:11:23.242
STAND HERE BEFORE YOU IN

02:11:23.308 --> 02:11:24.710
SUPPORT OF THE BILL WITH ALL A

02:11:24.776 --> 02:11:26.478
LEVIN OF MY CITIES IN

02:11:26.545 --> 02:11:28.313
OPPOSITION. SO I WILL HAVE

02:11:28.380 --> 02:11:29.681
EXPLAINING TO DO WHEN I GO BACK

02:11:29.748 --> 02:11:31.316
HOME BUT I THINK WHEN I SIT

02:11:31.383 --> 02:11:32.884
DOWN AND TALK TO THE OUR CITIES

02:11:32.951 --> 02:11:34.820
MY CITIES. THERE'S SOMETHING

02:11:34.886 --> 02:11:35.854
THAT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND AND

02:11:35.921 --> 02:11:37.456
I HOPE THAT I CAN HELP THEM TO

02:11:37.522 --> 02:11:39.558
UNDERSTAND THAT. I THINK IT'S

02:11:39.625 --> 02:11:41.226
EASY TO PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS

02:11:41.293 --> 02:11:42.661
BUT WHAT'S REALLY DIFFICULT IS

02:11:42.728 --> 02:11:44.696
TO FIND A BILL OR FIND

02:11:44.763 --> 02:11:45.297
SOMETHING WHERE EVERYBODY'S A

02:11:45.364 --> 02:11:46.732
LITTLE HAPPY. THERE WAS A

02:11:46.798 --> 02:11:48.533
LITTLE UNHAPPY I THINK RIGHT

02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:51.103
NOW THIS BILL IS SB FIFTY. IF

02:11:51.169 --> 02:11:52.671
IT GETS OFF THE FLOOR TODAY

02:11:52.738 --> 02:11:53.905
THERE CERTAINLY MORE WORK THAT

02:11:53.972 --> 02:11:55.774
WILL BE DONE. I WOULD IMPLORE

02:11:55.841 --> 02:11:58.310
EVERYONE HERE TODAY TO GIVE GO

02:11:58.377 --> 02:12:00.112
UP ON THE BILL FOR THE BILL

02:12:00.178 --> 02:12:01.980
GETS OUT OF THE HOUSE WE CAN DO

02:12:02.047 --> 02:12:03.849
SOME MORE WORK ON IT. I

02:12:03.915 --> 02:12:05.384
APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR I THANK

02:12:05.450 --> 02:12:06.752
YOU FOR EVERYTHING OU'VE DONE

02:12:06.818 --> 02:12:08.754
AND I THINK ALL OF MY

02:12:08.820 --> 02:12:09.421
COLLEAGUES FOR ALL OF THEIR

02:12:09.488 --> 02:12:12.524
COMMENTS CONCERNS. THIS IS THE

02:12:12.591 --> 02:12:15.027
MOST PRESSING ISSUE WITH NO FOR

02:12:15.093 --> 02:12:16.094
EVERYONE IN THE STATE FOR YOU.

02:12:16.161 --> 02:12:20.132
CAME OUT OF. I REGION I HAVE.

02:12:20.198 --> 02:12:23.101
SENATOR ALAN. MEMBERS CERTAINLY

02:12:23.168 --> 02:12:24.469
WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THIS

02:12:24.536 --> 02:12:26.672
ROBUST DISCUSSION- I DO ALSO

02:12:26.738 --> 02:12:28.507
BELIEVE THAT THE AUTHOR IS HELP

02:12:28.573 --> 02:12:29.841
TO SHIFT THE CONVERSATION ABOUT

02:12:29.908 --> 02:12:32.010
THE NEED FOR HOUSING AND I'VE

02:12:32.077 --> 02:12:34.446
I'VE SEEN AS A RESULT- MEMBERS

02:12:34.513 --> 02:12:36.715
OF MY OWN LOCAL COMMUNITY

02:12:36.782 --> 02:12:38.917
TALKING ABOUT SOLUTIONS AND

02:12:38.984 --> 02:12:39.918
THAT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE

02:12:39.985 --> 02:12:41.320
CONSIDERED SEVERAL YEARS

02:12:41.386 --> 02:12:42.888
EARLIER AND I THINK YOU SEEN

02:12:42.954 --> 02:12:44.289
SOME AGGRESSIVE BUT CERTAINLY

02:12:44.356 --> 02:12:45.624
INADEQUATE LEGISLATION PASSED

02:12:45.691 --> 02:12:47.626
OUT OF THIS HOUSE- BECAUSE OF

02:12:47.693 --> 02:12:50.429
HIS EFFORTS- I CONTINUE TO HAVE

02:12:50.495 --> 02:12:51.396
SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL

02:12:51.463 --> 02:12:54.700
THAT I AND I APPRECIATE THE

02:12:54.766 --> 02:12:56.234
CALL IF WE THAT WE JUST. HEARD

02:12:56.301 --> 02:12:57.602
ABOUT AFFORDABILITY BUT I THINK

02:12:57.669 --> 02:12:59.504
ONE THE CONCERN WE HAVE ABOUT

02:12:59.571 --> 02:13:01.006
THE BILL AS IT IS AND WHEN THE

02:13:01.073 --> 02:13:02.341
REASONS WHY SO MANY OF THE

02:13:02.407 --> 02:13:04.710
TENANTS GROUPS AND THE AND YOU

02:13:04.776 --> 02:13:05.544
KNOW THE AB THE POVERTY

02:13:05.610 --> 02:13:06.945
ADVOCATES AND A POVERTY

02:13:07.012 --> 02:13:08.113
ADVOCATES ARE ARE SO CONTINUE

02:13:08.180 --> 02:13:12.217
TO BE SO CONCERNED THE BILL IS

02:13:12.284 --> 02:13:14.419
DIED IN YET TODAY EIGHT EIGHT

02:13:14.486 --> 02:13:19.758
EIGHT YOU TALK ABOUT. FARM 48%

02:13:19.825 --> 02:13:20.859
OF AVERAGE ME INCOME. IT DOES

02:13:20.926 --> 02:13:23.628
OFFER PROOF. FOR GOING LOWER-

02:13:23.695 --> 02:13:24.830
BUT IN THE END OF THE DAY THOSE

02:13:24.896 --> 02:13:26.732
POSTS PROVISIONS ARE OPTIONAL.

02:13:26.798 --> 02:13:29.735
AND SO- YEAH I THINK THAT'S

02:13:29.801 --> 02:13:31.236
THAT'S BEEN A LITTLE LOST IN IN

02:13:31.303 --> 02:13:33.004
SOME OF THE DISCUSSION. I ALSO

02:13:33.071 --> 02:13:35.640
BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE SO MANY

02:13:35.707 --> 02:13:36.241
DIFFERENT CITIES WITH VARYING

02:13:36.308 --> 02:13:39.044
LEVELS OF EFFORT- AND THE BILL

02:13:39.111 --> 02:13:41.113
DOES NOT. ADEQUATELY PROVIDE

02:13:41.179 --> 02:13:42.481
FOR DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO

02:13:42.547 --> 02:13:43.115
THOSE DIFFERENT CITIES IN THEIR

02:13:43.181 --> 02:13:44.983
LEVELS OF EFFORT. AND I THINK

02:13:45.050 --> 02:13:46.184
THAT'S ANOTHER CHALLENGE THAT I

02:13:46.251 --> 02:13:47.486
HAVE WITH THE BILL THE OTHER

02:13:47.552 --> 02:13:50.155
THING I WANT TO BRING UP AND-

02:13:50.222 --> 02:13:51.189
YOU KNOW AND I DO REALLY

02:13:51.256 --> 02:13:52.290
ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH ALL THE

02:13:52.357 --> 02:13:53.892
COMMENTS MADE BY PACIFIC FROM

02:13:53.959 --> 02:13:55.260
MY COLLEAGUES IN LOS ANGELES-

02:13:55.327 --> 02:13:56.661
WE HAD SEVERAL WHO HAVE.

02:13:56.728 --> 02:13:57.562
BROUGHT UP A NUMBER OF ISSUES

02:13:57.629 --> 02:13:59.765
THAT I WON'T REPEAT- BUT THERE

02:13:59.831 --> 02:14:01.500
IS A WHOLE OTHER CHALLENGES TO

02:14:01.566 --> 02:14:02.267
SEE WITH HISTORIC ZONES. MAKING

02:14:02.334 --> 02:14:06.538
SURE THERE ARE- WITH THE WITH

02:14:06.605 --> 02:14:07.806
THE STORE CHARACTER OF A MANY

02:14:07.873 --> 02:14:08.340
OF OUR NEIGHBORS IS. EVAN

02:14:08.407 --> 02:14:08.974
PROTECTED I KNOW THERE'S SOME

02:14:09.040 --> 02:14:09.941
WHICH IN THE BILL RIGHT NOW TO

02:14:10.008 --> 02:14:11.777
PRESERVE. AND PROTECT THOSE

02:14:11.843 --> 02:14:13.145
HISTORIC ZONES THAT WERE

02:14:13.211 --> 02:14:13.945
REGISTERED WITH THE STATE.

02:14:14.012 --> 02:14:16.281
PRIOR TO TWENTY TEN. BUT THE

02:14:16.348 --> 02:14:17.149
FACT THE MATTER IS THAT THE

SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT

02:19:44.843 --> 02:19:45.944

IN AGREEMENT THAT THIS HAS A

02:19:50.348 --> 02:19:52.717
LOT MORE WORK TO DO. I'M STILL

02:19:52.784 --> 02:19:56.454

NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS TONIGHT

02:19:57.422 --> 02:19:58.757
I HAVE TO CONTINUE TO WORK

02:19:58.823 --> 02:20:01.292
WITH. MY CITIES AND ESPECIALLY

02:20:01.359 --> 02:20:01.860
MANY OF YOUR CITIES WERE

02:20:01.926 --> 02:20:03.495
SMALLER CITIES. THEY DON'T HAVE

02:20:03.561 --> 02:20:05.363
THE CAPACITY IN FUNDING TO

02:20:05.430 --> 02:20:07.599
PRODUCE HOUSING ELEMENTS EVEN

02:20:07.665 --> 02:20:09.267
THE BASIC. EVEN BEFORE THIS

02:20:09.334 --> 02:20:11.803
BECAME. A TO FRUITION. AND WE

IT'S A TWO OR A FIVE YEAR PLAN

02:20:19.744 --> 02:20:21.045
WHICH ISN'T. NECESSARILY

02:20:21.112 --> 02:20:23.715
EXPLICIT ON WHO IS A SENSE OF-

02:20:23.782 --> 02:20:25.483
SENSITIVE COMMUNITY. BUT

02:20:25.550 --> 02:20:27.285
PERHAPS A COULD BE IN. A THREE

02:20:27.352 --> 02:20:29.387
YEAR PLAN. DOWN THE ROAD

02:20:29.454 --> 02:20:30.822
BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY CITIES

02:20:30.889 --> 02:20:32.090
LIKE A CITY OF LONG BEACH OR

02:20:32.157 --> 02:20:32.924
SOME OTHER CITIES THAT ARE

02:20:32.991 --> 02:20:36.060
SPOTTY. THERE'S SOME PLACES

02:20:36.127 --> 02:20:36.694
THAT ARE SENSITIVE THERE'S SOME

02:20:36.761 --> 02:20:39.197
PLACES THAT ARE NOT. AND LASTLY

02:20:39.264 --> 02:20:40.598

FIGHT FOR YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE

02:20:42.367 --> 02:20:43.501
TALKING ABOUT INCLUSIONARY

02:20:43.568 --> 02:20:44.035
ZONING COMING FROM LOCAL

02:20:44.102 --> 02:20:46.137
GOVERNMENT AS WELL. FROM A CITY

02:20:46.204 --> 02:20:47.639
THAT HAS BEEN TRYING TO PUSH

02:20:47.705 --> 02:20:49.240

THIS IT'S ABOUT SETTING

02:37:33.143 --> 02:37:34.478

02:37:34.545 --> 02:37:36.680
PROPOSE TO DO THAT DO YOU THINK

02:37:36.747 --> 02:37:38.448
THAT WILDLIFE PREVENTION IS A

02:37:38.515 --> 02:37:40.450
HIGH PRIORITY FOR OUR STATE

02:37:40.517 --> 02:37:42.252

02:37:42.319 --> 02:37:44.321
BE YES AND YOU ASK THEM ABOUT

02:37:44.388 --> 02:37:45.522

BE A HIGH PRIORITY BECAUSE WE
