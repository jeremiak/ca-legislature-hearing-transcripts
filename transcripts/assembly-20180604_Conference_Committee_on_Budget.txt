DAY TWO OF OUR BUDGET OFFICE COMMITTEE BUT DAY THREE. OH WE ARE STARTING WITH A ISSUE ONE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE EXPANSION AFFORDABILITY. WE WILL GO FIRST ALEJO THAN TO MISS COST. GOOD AFTERNOON HURTING TERM ADJOINED MEMBERS MARK NEWTON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE A. MISTER CHAIR WOULD YOU LIKE US TO GIVE JUST A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ISSUES BEFORE BEGINNING WITH ISSUE ONE. YES THAT'S VERY GOOD AND. SO. PLEASURE TO UP AND TO PRESENT AN OVERVIEW OF HHS HHS ISSUES AND CONFERENCE WE HAVE A A FOUR PAGE. OVERVIEW THAT IS IN YOUR HANDOUT AND WE FOLLOWED BY A DISCUSSION OF THE. INDIVIDUAL ISSUES SO. I'M NOT PRESENT THE HANDOUT AND WHICH SHOWS THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE HOUSES BOTH FUNDING DIFFERENCES AS WELL AS LANGUAGE DIFFERENCES. WILL PROVIDE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE OVERVIEW DOCUMENT AS WELL HAS SOME HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS. AND SO TURNING TO THE AT TO THE OVERVIEW DOCUMENT A FEW GENERAL POINTS TO NOTE THAT SAID. THAT THESE ARE SOLELY ISSUES IN CONFERENCE I WILL MENTION A FEW CASES WHERE BOTH HOUSES MADE SIGNIFICANT AUGMENTATIONS OF. WELL THE SAME AMOUNT AND FOR THE SAME PURPOSE. ON THESE ARE LEGISLATIVE CHANGES TO THE BUDGET PLAN. TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PLAN. THERE A FEW CASES CASES WHERE SAVINGS ARE INVOLVED BUT FOR THE MOST PART THESE ARE AUGMENTATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE'S BUDGET PLAN. OUR OVERVIEW DOCUMENT. IS IN GENERAL FUND REPRESENTS GENERAL FUND DOLLARS THERE ARE FEW CASES WHERE OTHER FUNDING SOURCES ARE INVOLVED THE MAIN OTHER FUNDING SOURCES PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX IN ALL MAKE NOTE OF. OF OF THAT WHEN WE. WHEN WE ARRIVE AT THOSE THOSE ISSUES. SO WHILE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OVERLAPPING FUNDING FORTIES BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES I NOTE THAT THE HIGHEST FUNDING CORDY OF OF EACH HOUSE IS RELATIVELY CLEAR. FOR THE ASSEMBLY IT'S HEALTHCARE COVERAGE AN EXPANSION FOR THE SENATE IT'S CASH AND FOOD ASSISTANCE BENEFITS. SO I WILL FIRST TURN TO A TO A DISCUSSION OF THESE RESPECTIVE HIGHEST FUNDING PRIORITIES. SO TURNING TO HEALTH CARE COVERAGE EXPANSION AND FOR PORTABILITY THIS IS ON PAGE FOUR OF YOUR AGENDA. SO TO ACHIEVE THIS BROAD OBJECTIVE OF OF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE EXPANSION IN AFFORDABILITY THERE ARE POTENTIALLY A NUMBER OF SORT OF CHEAP. MAIN TYPES OF ACTIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE CAN TAKE ONE IS EXPANDING MEDICAL ELIGIBILITY IN SOME WAY. AND THE OTHER IS MAKING INSURANCE PURCHASE THROUGH COVERED CALIFORNIA MORE AFFORDABLE. AND TO SOME DEGREE EACH HOUSE TAKES ACTIONS ARE SORT OF IN IN IN THESE AREAS. THERE IS A COMMON PROPOSAL OF BOTH HOUSES THAT ISN'T NOTED ON ARE AT. ON OUR A HANDOUT IN THAT IS EXPANDING MEDICAID ELIGIBILITY TO ONE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT OF FEDERAL POVERTY LINE FOR. OUR SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. AND THAT THAT HAS AN ONGOING COST OF AROUND THIRTY THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. I I KNOW JUST A VERY BRIEF SERVE AIR ON. HEALTH CARE COVERAGE EXPANSION AND AFFORDABILITY THE THE ITEM EXPANDING A STATE ALL PAYER HEALTH CARE. PAYMENT DATABASE IT SHOULD BE EIGHT POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS OFFER THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL WHEN YOU INCLUDE ALL THE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE AFFECTED BY THAT THAT PROPOSAL. SO WHAT'S NOTABLE WITH THIS THIS ISSUE AREA IS THAT IS THE OUT YOUR COSTS AND YET YOUR COSTS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN THE. THE BUDGET YOUR COSTS JUST BECAUSE OF THE TIMING OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE. THE ITEMS SO FOR THE FOR THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL WHICH. IT'S JUST A LITTLE UNDER THREE HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE. FOR THE BUDGET YEAR THAT. INCREASES TO AROUND NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE IN THE OUT YEARS AND IT'S MAINLY THE THE AFFORDABILITY PROPOSAL. PROVIDING PREMIUM ASSISTANCE FOR HEALTH INSURANCE. THAT INCREASES FROM ONE FIFTY TO ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE OUT YEARS. ANDY EXTENDING MEDICAID ELIGIBILITY TO LOW INCOME UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS YOUNG ADULTS THAT INCREASES FROM ONE TWENTY FIVE TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION INFO YOUR IMPLEMENTATION. ON THE SENATE SIDE THE THE MAJOR PROPOSAL TO EXTEND MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY TWENTY OCCUPIED IMMIGRANTS OVER SIXTY FIVE. THAT'S A SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS CURRENT BUDGET YOUR PROPOSAL DOT SAID BECOMES ABOUT ONE FIFTY IN INFO YOUR IMPLEMENTATION. SO TURNING TO THE THE SENATE SIR. RELATIVE HIGH FUNDING FORTY ON PAGE FIVE OF THE AGENDA LOOKING AT CASH AND FOOD ASSISTANCE BENEFITS. THE THE KEY PART OF THE SENATE PROPOSAL IS TO. TO INCREASE CAL WORKS GRANTS TO FIFTY PERCENT OF FEDERAL POVERTY LINE BASED ON FAMILY SIZE AS WELL AS. REINSTATING THE ANNUAL CAL WORKS COLA AS WELL AS REINSTATING THE ANNUAL SSPA COLA. SO. THOSE COSTS ARE LOW OVER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE IN THE BUDGET YEAR IN THE OUT YEARS WITH FULL IMPLEMENTATION. THE COST INCREASE TO A LITTLE AROUND TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS. THE SENATE ALSO HAS A KEY POLICY PROPOSAL RICHARD IS A SAFETY NET RESERVE PROPOSAL. WE DON'T LIST DOLLAR AMOUNT TO HEAR BUT THE PROPOSAL DOESN'T SOLVE A TRANSFER OF FUNDS INTO A NEW SAFETY NET RESERVE ACCOUNT. BASICALLY THE THE CONCEPT HERE IS CREATING A CAL WORKS AND NOT A CAL SAFETY NET TO. A RESERVE SOME ACCOUNT AND SENDING A SIGNAL TO THE LEGISLATURE EARTH SENDING A SIGNAL THAT THE LEGISLATURE. ARE WANTS TO ENSURE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING FOR SAFETY NET SET BEES TO SAFETY NET PROGRAMS HAS COST INCREASE IN THESE PROGRAMS AND TOUGH FISCAL TIMES AS CASELOAD. INCREASES SO THE THE PRECISE LANGUAGE OF THE PROPOSAL STILL BEING WORKED OUT BUT THAT IS THAT THE BASIC CONCEPT OF OF THE SENATE. POLICY PROPOSAL THERE. THE ASSEMBLY DOES HAVE A A FEW ITEMS SERVING CACHING FOR ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS. AREN'T THERE LARGELY ONE TIME ACTIONS IN LARGELY. AUGMENTING THE GOVERNORS ARE. VERY IMPORTANT POLICY PROPOSAL AKHAL THE SSI CASH WROTE YEAH ENDING THE US I SSI CASTRO IT IS A MAJOR POLICY CHANGE THERE IS SOME COST BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE'S POLICY ACTION WAS TO HOLD HARMLESS. AFFECTED HOUSEHOLDS ARE AND THAT IS THE ACOSTA OF AROUND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE IN THE IN THE BUDGET YEAR. SO WILL NOW TURN TO SOME OF THE OTHER SORT OF MAJOR. POLICY ARE FUNDING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE HOUSES ELTERN TO. ON PAGE FOR THE AGENDA TO HEALTH PROVIDER PAYMENT INCREASES. AND YOU'LL SEE A QUITE A SIGNIFICANT FUNDING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE THE TWO HOUSES BUT I NOTE. THERE'S AN IMPORTANT REASON OR FOR THAT AND THAT THE SENATE ACTION TO. ADMIT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR SUPPLEMENTAL PROVIDER PROVIDER PAYMENTS IN THE MEDICAL WORLD USING POT FIFTIES IT'S FUNDING WAS INACTION TALK. BECAUSE THE. THE AT AS THAT MAY REVISION THE GOVERNOR LEFT ON ALLOCATED TO SIT SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDING FOR MEDI CAL. ON FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION WITH THE LEGISLATURE THE SENATE DID TAKE ACTION THE ASSEMBLY DEFERRED ITS ACTION SO IT'S QUITE LIKELY THAT THE. THE ASSEMBLY WILL BE TAKING OR THE. ULTIMATELY WILL HAVE. PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDING FOR FOR THIS PURPOSE BUT THAT EXPLAINS THAT THE KEY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE YEAR. THE TWO THE TWO HOUSES. BRIEFLY TURNING TO MEDI CAL BENEFITS. SORT OF RELATIVELY MODEST DE AUGMENTATIONS OF BOTH HOUSES JUST NOTE ON THE AT. THE THE SENATE SIDE THE. THE RESTORATION OF OPTIONAL BENEFITS WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER A YEAR COST OF A LITTLE OVER FORTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS CALLED ALL IN ALL IN THE BUDGET YOU'RE NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE IN THE. IN THE FUNDING AMOUNT. IN THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH THIS IS AN EXAMPLE RELATIVELY SMALL. AUGMENTATIONS OF BOTH HOUSES ESSENTIALLY DIFFERENT SETS OF AUGMENTATIONS I NOTE THAT THE ASSEMBLY RELATIVE TO THE TO THE SENATE IS CHOOSING TO USE PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDING. FOR EXCUSE ME PROPOSITION SIXTY THREE FUNDING FOR MANY OF THE THE AUGMENTATIONS. TURNING TO PAGE FIVE OF THE THE HANDOUT HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE. DEVELOPMENT. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT CUTS ACROSS HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND AND EDUCATION AND THE TO BUDGET AREAS. AND ARE HANDLED REFLECTS THE TOTALITY OF THE THE AUGMENTATIONS AT PROPOSED BY ED BY BOTH HOUSES. A I KNOW THAT THE SENATE PROPOSAL INCLUDES A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDING AGAIN THIS IS THE SENATE'S ACTION TOO. TO ALLOCATE FUNDS THAT THE GOVERNOR LAUGHED UNALLOCATED BUT THE ASSEMBLY IS YET TO TAKE TAKE THOSE ACTIONS. TURNING TO PUBLIC HEALTH VERY BRIEFLY. RELATIVELY SMALL DIFFERENCE IN TOTAL AUGMENTATIONS. BOTH HOUSES THAT O'DONNELL HAD A DIFFERENT SET OF OF AUGMENTATIONS I DO KNOW THOUGH THOUGH THAT BOTH HOUSES DID NOT MATCH THE SAME SET OF PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS. BY ABOUT THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE IN THE BUDGET YEAR IN ADDITION TO TO THE THE DIFFERENT AUGMENTATIONS THAT YOU THAT YOU SEE HERE. CHILD WELFARE SERVICES. THE AUGMENTATION VETERAN CAR CONFERENCE ARE. LARGELY ASSEMBLY ONLY. AND. IMMIGRATION RELATED LEGAL SERVICES AGAIN. AUGMENTATIONS THAT WERE MADE BY THE ASSEMBLY AND ALL WILL BE AT ONE TIME IN NATURE. IN THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES AREA I DO NOT THAT BOTH HOUSES DID MAKE. THE SAME AUGMENTATION. IN TERMS OF RESTORING FUNDING FOR SOME OF THE RECESSIONARY BUDGET CUTS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF DON'T AND SERVICES THAT TOTALS ABOUT THIRTY FOUR MILLION. BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT ACTION THE ASSEMBLY ONLY A. MADE A NUMBER OF. AUGMENTATIONS AND IT THE KEY ONE BEING PROVIDING. BRIDGE FUNDING TO IT TO ASSIST TO DEVELOP DEVELOPMENT SERVICES VENDORS WHO. ARE IN HIGH COST AREAS TO TO TO A HIGH LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE THAT'S A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR SURVIVE MEDITATION AND DEATH THINK TWENTY THIRD SAY IT. QUITE A A SIGNIFICANT FUNDING FORTY OF THE OF THE ASSEMBLY. AGING AND SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES MOSTLY. ASSEMBLY AUGMENTATIONS THEIR. COUNTY ADMINISTRATION AND A SUPPORT OF YOU SEE VARIOUS AUGMENTATIONS OF. OF BOTH FATTEN BOTH HOUSES THERE. WHAT IS NOT SHOWN IN THE FIGURE IS AN AUGMENTATION THAT BOTH HOUSES MADE? THOUGHT NOTHING RAP ABOUT THE GREAT CERTAINLY. TALK MEANT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR FOSTER PARENT RETENTION. AND THE BOTTOM LINE MEMBERS. IN TERMS OF THAT THE TOTAL COST OF. OF FLOOD OF ALL OF THESE AUGMENTATIONS DOT TO IF YOU ASSUME THAT THE. ASSEMBLY DOES ARE ARE ALLOCATE THE PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDING THAT WAS LEFT ON ALLOCATED THE PROPOSALS ARE ACTUALLY FAIRLY SIMILAR IN THE BUDGET YEAR COSTING AROUND ONE POINT. THREE BILLION DOLLARS THE THE DIFFERENCE IS MAINLY ABOUT YOUR DIFFERENCE WHERE THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL ARE IN THE OUT YEARS WHICH INCREASED ABOUT ONE POINT SIX BILLION. AND USE THE SENATE THREE POINT ONE BILLION BY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. SO THAT'S AND IS THE PRESENTATION AND POPULAR ANSWER QUESTIONS WOULD'VE LIKE YOU MISS COST. I HAVE MISTER CHAIR ANY COST APARTMENT OF FINANCIAL TO FOR MY COMMENTS TO EACH OF THE ISSUE I WAS BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. WONDERFUL THANK YOU WHEN WE START WITH ISSUE ONE THAT. HEALTHCARE COVERAGE EXPANSION FOR BUT I BELIEVE MANY OF THE ITEMS YOU COVERED IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS SO. IF THERE'S ANY IF THERE'S NO IT. ANYTIME YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AROUND WILL THE WITH THE LA O. AS YOU MENTIONED MANY OF THE ITEMS. THAT ARE ON THIS FIRST ISSUE WORD DISCUSSED AND IN OUR OVERVIEW PRESENTATION. ALL ADD JUST. A FEW NOTES ON SOME OF THESE. WITH RESPECT TO THE. PROPOSAL TO INCREASE THE ELIGIBILITY THRESHOLD FOR THE AGED AND DISABLED POPULATION. WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT. SUBSEQUENT TO THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE LEGISLATURE IN BOTH HOUSES WE RECEIVED. I'M AN ESTIMATE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION THAT WHILE WE'RE STILL REVIEWING IT APPEARS THE COSTS I'M ADOPTED BY BOTH HOUSES ARE ARE LIKELY AND LESS THAN THE ONGOING COSTS OF THIS ACTION. WE BELIEVE THESE COST COULD BE. ABOVE A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND ONGOING. AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND WITH RESPECT. TO THAT PROPOSAL WITH RESPECT TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE HOUSES THAT SIMPLY A QUESTION OF THE IMPLEMENTATION DATE. ON THE SIGNIFICANT PROPOSAL AND FOR AFFORDABILITY AND COVERED CALIFORNIA AND WE WOULD SIMPLY NOTE THAT THEIR. ARE SEVERAL QUESTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO RESOLVE WITH RESPECT TO. THIS PROPOSAL SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE DECIDE TO PURSUE IT. QUESTIONS REGARDING AT WHAT FORM THIS BE PROVIDED WHETHER THAT'S DIRECT ASSISTANCE OR A TAX CREDIT. AND WHICH AGENCY WOULD ADMINISTER THIS ASSISTANCE I'M CURRENTLY THESE PROPOSALS ARE BUDGETED WITH THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. DEPENDING ON THE FORM THAT THE ASSISTANCE TAKES WEBSITE YOU MAY WISH TO ASSIGN US TO OTHER AGENCIES INCLUDING COVER CALIFORNIA. AND WITHOUT ALL OF US FINALLY NOTE THAT THE WORKFORCE. PROPOSALS THAT ARE LISTED ON THIS ISSUE WILL ALSO BE DISCUSSED AS PART OF YOUR NEXT. AGENDA ITEM SEPARATELY. THANK YOU BACK TO COMMITTEE ANY. OR MISS COST I'M. IN THE US DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE A THING A MINUTE I HAVE FOCUSED MY TIME ON THE EXPANSION AFFORDABILITY COMPONENTS OF THE PACKAGE BEFORE YOU BUT CERTAINLY HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS BUT. A LARGELY THAT'S THE IN THE BIG DOLLAR AMOUNT IN THE PACKAGE BEFORE YOU. FIRST I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION AND WE'VE MADE SOME SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN RECENT YEARS. ON AND SIGNIFICANT ONGOING INVESTMENTS. IN THE EXPANSION OF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE ON UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THE EXPANSION OF FULL MEDICAL. COVERAGE TO UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN PROVIDING COVERAGE TO MORE THAN FOUR MILLION ADDITIONAL CALIFORNIANS THE COST OF THE OPTIONAL EXPANSION POPULATION AND FULL MEDICAL COVERAGE FRONT DOCUMENT CHILDREN IS ESTIMATED TO GROW TO APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT SIX BILLION. GENERAL FUND AND THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE MILLION GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO RESPECTIVELY. I'M MORE HAPPY TO NOTE THAT THE STATE'S UNCOVERED RATE IS SOMEWHERE LESS THAN TEN PERCENT SO IT'S REALLY MADE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON MANY CALIFORNIANS. ON AS THE ANALYST HAS POINTED OUT I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION IS CONCERNED THAT SOME OF THE ADOPTED PROPOSALS ARE PROBABLY UNDERSTATED IN THEIR COSTS. THE COST OF THE PROPOSED EXPANSIONS FOR EXAMPLE. WE BELIEVE HIGH THE ESTIMATE IS MORE LIKELY FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO POINT THREE MILLION GENERAL FUND IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN GROWING TO AN ESTIMATED COST OF ONE POINT SIX BILLION IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. SO OBVIOUSLY THIS PARTICULAR PACKAGES ONE I HAD THAT IS IMPACTED BY THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE BUDGET CLEARLY THESE AUGMENTATIONS ARE A BOB WITH THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED IN HIS FISCAL PLAN. AND. MANY OF THEM HAVE ON GOING COSTS WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS ON THE PACKAGE. THANK YOU SENATOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF MISTER CHAIR ARE HAPPY MONDAY MISS COSTA. QUICK CLEAR FOR CATIA FOR ME THE DOLLAR FIGURE. FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S PERSPECTIVE THAT YOU DISQUALIFIED WHEN YOU REFER TO THE EXPANSION PACKAGE YOU MEAN THE ENTIRE PACKAGE IS REFLECTED ON PAGE FOR THE LA ELVES AGENDA BOTH THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY PROPOSALS. THAT'S CORRECT SENATOR AND COULD YOU GIVE ME THAT OVERALL DOLLAR MIGHT AGAIN ONE MORE TIME I'M SORRY. YES SO WE ESTIMATE FOR BOTH HOUSES THE TOTAL COST IS AT THE EXPANSION AT FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO POINT THREE MILLION GENERAL FUND IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. GROWING TO ONE POINT SIX BILLION AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND SO MY QUESTION IS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE. THE APPROACH THE TWO HOUSES OF TAKE IN AND ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF OUR. UNDOCUMENTED. FELT CALIFORNIANS. I KNOW UCLA HAS DONE AN ANALYSIS THE COST ANALYSIS NOT ONLY FOR THE COVERAGE BUT. THE COSTS FOR PROVIDING CARE. THROUGH E. R. OR OTHER MEASURES. TO THESE TWO POPULATIONS SO IT GEEK IN THE LA OUR ANYONE. RESPOND TO I GUESS WE YOU KNOW WHAT'S NOT WHAT'S IN FRONT OF US IS THE COST OF EXPANDING COVERAGE WHAT IS NOT HERE AN APPARENT TO US. ARE THE REAL COSTS WE ALL BEAR BY NOT PROVIDING COVERAGE TO THIS RESIDENT POPULATION SO COULD WE TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT I THINK IT JUST GIVES US. A FRAME OF REFERENCE ARE FRAMEWORK BY WHICH TO HAVE THE BROADER CONVERSATION BECAUSE IT'S NOT AS IF. IT DOESN'T COST US ALL TODAY EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE PROVIDED. COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE. WOULD KNOW JUST A FEW THINGS FIRST. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CURRENTLY DOES PROVIDE FUNDING FOR CERTAIN EMERGENCY IN PREGNANCY RELATED SERVICES FOR UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. THOSE FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE NOW AND. I BELIEVE ESTIMATES THAT ARE BEFORE YOU FOR THE EXPANSION PROPOSAL REFLECT THE CONTINUATION OF THOSE FUNDS IN THE FUTURE. I BELIEVE WHAT YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT IS HE POSSIBILITY THAT EXPANDING COVERAGE TO THESE. UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS WOULD REDUCE. CERTAIN STATE COSTS RELATED TO CARE IN EMERGENCY ROOMS. THOSE. ARE CERTAINLY A POSSIBILITY HOWEVER AND THERE DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE AND. LIKELY WOULD OCCUR OVER TIME AND NOT NECESSARILY AND IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE. BUT BUT CERTAINLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT THAT IS A POSSIBILITY THAT. INCREASED ACCESS TO PREVENTIVE CARE COULD IN SOME CASES. RESULT IN AVOIDING OTHER COSTS I'M AT THE SAME TIME SOME STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT TIME INCREASED ACCESS TO HEALTH COVERAGE AND INTACT INCREASES UTILIZATION. WHICH AT COULD BE A GOOD THING AGAIN IN THE LONGER RUN. BUT IT'S IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO TELL ON THE NEAR TERM BECAUSE THE ASSUMPTION IS WE'RE WE'RE IMPROVING HEALTH OUTCOMES SO. THAT MY COSTS DON'T WHAT WERE WE ABLE WHEN WE ADDRESS THE ISSUE WITH REGARD TO UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN LACK HERE WERE WE ABLE TO IDENTIFY. I'M COSTS THAT THE STATE HAD TO BEAR PRIOR TO. PROVIDING FULL SCOPE COVERAGE. WERE WE ABLE TO DO IT FOR THAT POPULATION. I I GUESS AMASSING GOES ON. SO ME BASING RESPONSE MY EXPECTATION IS NOT REASONABLE TERMS WOULD JUST ARE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THOSE COSTS. I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY ESTIMATE OF THAT. SO THE UNDERSEA DEPARTMENT FINANCE SO WE WE WE DO ACTUALLY ACCOUNT FOR THE PROGRAM AS IT RUNS TODAY AND SO WE'VE GOT A RESTRICTED SCOPE PROGRAM IN WHICH WE DO GET SOME FEDERAL FUNDING FOR EMERGENCY PREGNANCY SERVICES. AND WHAT WE BASICALLY ASSUMES THAT THAT OLD PROGRAM GOES AWAY SO WE COUNT FOR ALL OF THE SAVINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT AND THEN THE NEW PROGRAM IN WHICH THERE'S YOU KNOW I'M MORE STATE ONLY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT AND SO. THAT ANALYSIS IS DONE WE SCORED THESE FISCAL'S AND AND AS WELL AS FOR THE SP SEVENTY FIVE WILSHIRE. YOU'RE. THANK YOU CENTER MORLOCK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR JUST A COUPLE QUICK HOUSEKEEPING KIND OF. QUESTIONS IF I MAY UM. FOR. OF THE LA DOES REPORT MISTER NEWTON I'M ASSUMING THAT THESE ARE ALL. AUGMENTATIONS ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING SO THAT'S WHY THERE'S NOT A COLUMN FOR GOVERNOR. FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YES THAT THAT'S CORRECT TO SENATOR DIVVY UP THERE A FEW ITEMS WHERE IT IS AN AUGMENTATION OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IN THAT IS THAT IS NOTED. AND THERE ARE A COUPLE CASES WHERE THERE ACTUAR SAVINGS BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE ONE HOUSE IN THERE DIDN'T ADOPT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR THAT BUT FOR THE MOST PART THESE ARE AUGMENTATIONS TO THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN. AND THEN IT IS THE POLICY OF THE AUDIO. PROVIDE SUB TOTALS AND PUT PARENTHESES AROUND HIM TO IF I THAT THAT'S. A SUBTOTAL IS THAT CORRECT. YES YES CAN YOUR MAINTAINING A POLICY. THE PROJECT TO JUST. RHETORICAL QUESTIONS YOU KNOW HOW HAS YOUR. THE REASON I BRING IT UP MR TEARS IN MY INDUSTRY IF YOU HAVE APPROACHES AROUND NUMBER IT MEANS IT'S NEGATIVE. AND SO I BROUGHT ALL GET USED TO THIS. BUT YOU KNOW HOW MUCH TOTAL WHAT ELSE Y. SO SO YOU HAVE ALL THE SUBTITLES BUT WHY NO TOTAL. I SAID SENATOR. NO REASON REALLY FOR NOT OF TOTAL THAT. BUT. AS A VERBALLY MENTIONED. WE DID TOTAL UP AND THE. FORTY. BUDGET YEAR. AND ESSENTIALLY BOTH HOUSES ARE ESSENTIALLY THEY THE SAME IF WE ASSUME THE THE ASSEMBLY ALLOCATES PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDING SO THE TOTAL HERE. A IS AROUND ONE POINT THREE BILLION THE BIG DIFFERENCES AND. IN THE OUT YEARS AND WHEN THAT THE SENATE PROPOSAL FULLY RAMPS UP IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THIS IS MAINLY THE CAL WORKS THAT GRANTS FOR PROPOSAL. THAT THE TOTAL COST OF THE SENATE AUGMENTATIONS IS THERE BUT THREE POINT ONE BILLION. WHERE THE ASSEMBLY IN THE OUT YEARS ABOUT ONE POINT SIX BILLION? YOU VERY MUCH YOU WHAT THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR. CENTER OFF. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON. THE LINE OF QUESTIONING THAT. MADAM VICE CHAIR STARTED. HAVING TO DO WITH OF TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON ALTERNATIVE COSTS FOR. FOR EXAMPLE EXTENDING MEDIC CAL ELIGIBILITY TO LOW INCOME IMMIGRANTS OVER AGE SIXTY FIVE. ARE THESE FOLKS ENTITLED TO GO TO THE FOR EXAMPLE THE COUNTY THE PUBLIC COST BILLS THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE FOR CARE. AND WHEN THEY SHOW UP. DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THEIR MEDICAL PROBLEM ARE AT THEIR. REQUIRED TO BE CARED FOR SO SOMEONE SPENDING SOME MONEY. TAKING CARE OF THIS POPULATION IS THAT. CAN SOMEBODY PLEASE TAKE THAT ON. YEAH YEAH SURE BEN JOHNSON WITH THE ILIO OF THAT IS TRUE OF SO MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS IN FACT ALL THE INDIVIDUALS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROJECTS WOULD GAIN COVER FULL SCOPE COVERAGE. UNDER THE EXPANSION THE FULL SCOPE FOR THE OVER SIXTY FIVE POPULATION ARE ALREADY ENROLLED IN WHAT'S KNOWN AS RESTRICTED SCOPE MEDICARE WHICH COVERS THEIR EMERGENCY AND. LESS LIKE ALFA MERGING TO. RELATED COSTS SO THAT'S ONE WAY IN WHICH THESE INDIVIDUALS DO GET THEIR HEALTHCARE COSTS PAID FOR WERE OUR MAIN BUT SEPARATE AND APART FROM THAT IF THEY SHOW UP. IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AT A PUBLIC KILEY HOW ANY HOSPITAL. AREN'T THEY REQUIRED TO BE SEEN. YES THEY THEY WILL GET SEEN AND THEN ANONYMOUS OF WHETHER THEY'RE AND EXPANDED SCOPE OR NOT EXPANDED SCOPE OR PARTIALLY PAID FOR WHATEVER SO THERE'S A COST. SOMEONE IS PAYING TODAY. TO TAKE CARE OF THESE FOLKS WHO ARE OVER AGE SIXTY FIVE LOW INCOME. AND IN THE CASE OF THE SENATE'S PROPOSAL UNDOCUMENTED CORRECT YES AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THEY CAN GAIN RETROACTIVE COVERAGE FOR THE EMERGENCY. EPISODE FOR BY WHICH THE FOR WHICH THEY WERE ADMITTED SO THEY WOULD GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND AFTER WHICH THEY COULD GAIN RESTRICTED SCOPE COVERAGE AND THEN MEDI CAL WOULD ULTIMATELY. PAY FOR THAT WITH THE THE SHERIFF COST BEING SPLIT BETWEEN THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OKAY I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. ON THE SENATE PROPOSAL IT'S. WHAT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR READ THAT CORRECTLY? WHAT WHAT ARE WE SPENDING TODAY? WINDOW DOESN'T ISN'T SOMEONE ABLE TO GET AN ESTIMATE OF WHAT OUR COST. WHETHER IT'S COMING OUT OF THE STATE GENERAL FUND BUDGET OR THE COUNTIES. RESPECTIVE BUDGETS SOMEBODY'S PAYING SOMETHING TO CARE FOR THESE PEOPLE AND I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A COMPARISON AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE VICE CHAIR WAS ATTEMPTING TO GET TO. WITH HER LINE OF QUESTIONS SO DO WE HAVE AN ESTIMATE WE DO SO THAT THE ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES THAT WE ARE SPENDING. ALMOST ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL FUNDS ABOUT FORTY FIVE THREE MILLION OF WHICH IS GENERAL FUND. THAT'S PROJECTED IN THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUT ONLY FOR THE EXISTING SERVICES TO WHICH THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE ALREADY ENTITLED AND THAT'S THAT'S SO THAT STATEWIDE SOME GENERAL FUND SOME COUNTY MONEY SOMETHING LIKE ASSUME SOMETHING ELSE THAT STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING THERE ARE ALSO SOME COUNTY FUNDS. TO SERVE THIS POPULATION IS WELL SOME ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS THAT ARE CAPTURED HERE BUT. FOR THE MEDI CAL EMERGENCY SERVICES THAT THEY THAT POPULATION OVER SIXTY FIVE WOULD BE USING OF THIS WOULD BE THE. MOST APPROPRIATE FUNDING ESTIMATE AND IT'S ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION TODAY. THAT'S PROJECTED INTO TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUT. THROUGHOUT THE MAYBE A LITTLE LESS THAN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN I WOULD ANTICIPATE. OKAY. IF I MAY OFFER JUST ONE COMMENT SENATOR AS A PERHAPS ALSO COULD COMPARE TO THE SENATE'S BUDGET PROPOSAL AT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION AS WELL OR FOR FULL SCOPE MEDI CAL COVERAGE FOR UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS WE ESTIMATE THE COSTS AT ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR MILLION GENERAL FUND IN THE BUDGET YEAR. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FOR MEDI CAL AN IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. NINETEEN TO TWENTY FIVE LET ME BACK THAT WE AS MAY BECAUSE OF A HUNDRED AND FOUR POINT TWO MILLION AND MEDICAID I'LL. IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND TO EXPAND FULL SCOPE COVERAGE TO ADULTS AGE SIXTY FIVE AND OVER. AND AT FULL ENROLLMENT WE WOULD EXPECT THAT COST TO GROW TO TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THREE POINT FOUR MILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO THAT'S A SUBSET OF HEIGHTEN YOUR QUESTION WHICH IS THAT IS A COST RIGHT NOW THEORETICALLY THAT'S BEING GENERATED THAT SOMEONE IS PAYING FOR. ITS LIKELY HIGHER BECAUSE WERE JUST CALCULATING THE GENERAL FUND PORTION OF IT. THAT AND I WOULD JUST NOTE ALSO. A SENATOR ROTH THAT THESE ARE. THE ESTIMATE THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ESTIMATE THAT'S IN THE SENATE ACTION WOULD BE NET OF THE GENERAL FUND COSTS THAT WE ARE ALREADY. SPENDING SO BE ON TOP OF OF THE GENERAL FUND COSTS THAT WE ARE. INCURRING FOR THESE RESTRICTED SCOPES THESE EMERGENCY BENEFITS AND ONE MORE TIME THAT'S A HUNDRED AND FOUR MILLION. I'M I'M GETTING EXISTING I'M NOT A NUMBERS GUY DEPEND ON SENATOR MORE LIKE FOR THAT SO. THEY DID HAVE THE EXISTING GENERAL FUND IS. IS ABOUT FORTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS I SEE SO THE THE HUNDRED AND. THE HUNDRED AND FOUR MILLION IS ON TOP OF THE FORTY SOMETHING MILLION. MAYBE IT'S THE SEVENTH THE SEVENTY FIVE OF THE SENATE'S ACTION WOULD BE WOULD BE ON TOP OF THAT FORTY THREE MILLION BINGO THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU CENTER CENTER SCARE. I TRIED FOLLOW WHAT. MISTER UP IRAQ WAS ASKING THEIR. MORE CAN. THE QUALITY OF MY QUESTION NO I DON'T THINK SO. SO. WE'RE LOOKING AT IS A CHART. AND LA O.. THESE NUMBERS WERE PRODUCED BY THE SENATE IN THE ASSEMBLY CORRECT. THEY'RE NOT YOUR NUMBERS. WITH LOOK UP CRACK SENATOR THESE ARE NUMBERS THAT ARE ENTERED INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CHANGE BOOK SYSTEM. AS A RESULT OF THE AT THE ACTIONS TAKEN. BUT AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE NOTED THERE MAY BE A FEW CASES WHERE. THE NUMBERS BEFORE YOU ARE WHAT THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED FOR THE AUGMENTATION. WE'VE RECORDED THEM RIGHT. YOU ONE WHAT THE NUMBERS WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE. BUT MY INTEREST IN HIS THAT THE ILIO ALSO CAME UP WITH. THEY USE SOME ASSUMPTION THING CAME UP THE SENATE NUMBERS WHERE ARE THOSE. DID YOU IT THERE ARE THEY NOT PRESENTED TO US WHERE THEY. I'M SORRY CHO CAME UP WITH NUMBERS ON THE PIECE. FOR EXAMPLE ON THE ESTIMATION OF WHAT IT WOULD COST US TO STANDS MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY. LOW INCOME UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS OVER THE AGE. IF I THAT IS CORRECT I'M WE CAME UP WITH AN ESTIMATE THAT. THE NET COST FOR THE OVER SIXTY FIVE POPULATION WOULD BE THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TO THE STATE FOR A FULL YEAR THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ESTIMATE IS MINE ACCORDING MY UNDERSTANDING IS. AS A HALF YOUR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE YEAH OF THE POLICY BUT THERE'S STILL A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR ESTIMATE AND THE SENATE'S ACTION. ALRIGHT SO FARCE IS THERE ARE ESTIMATES BASED ON HAPPIER THAN ARE FULL YEAR WOULD BE A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN YOU'RE SAYING. THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY. THAT IS CORRECT. NOW. I WANT TO RETURN TO THE CHAIRS QUESTION. I. REMINDED US THAT THERE ARE COSTS WE ARE ALREADY INCURRING BY THE FACT THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE. WHO? DO NOT HAVE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AND THEY TEND TO GO DOOR COUNTY HOSPITALS AND I WAS REMINDED THAT THE STATE HAS A COST YEAR. WITH THE COUNTY HOSPITALS SO IS THAT CARSHARE. IN OTHER WORDS DO ANY OF THESE ESTIMATES ACTOR THAT THERE WOULD BE A REDUCTION. IN THE COST THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY INCURRING. OR REPLACEMENT IN EFFECT. THROUGH THIS BUDGET ACTION. WHETHER IT THE MONEY GETS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT MINISTRATIONS ESTIMATE OF FOR THE SIXTY FIVE PLUS. IT'S TOTAL A HUNDRED AND FOUR POINT TWO MILLION GENERAL FUND. AND THIS ACCOUNTS FOR A COST SAVINGS OF FORTY THREE POINT THREE MILLION GENERAL FUND FOR THE COSTA WERE INCURRING TODAY FOR SIXTY FIVE AND ABOVE. AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION IS WHEN THE ADMINISTRATION GAVE US THE ESTIMATE OF. THE EXPANSION BEING FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE MILLION IN THAT. GENERAL FUND IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WHERE YOU'RE REFERRING ONLY. TO THE. SEVEN ITEMS IN THE VERY TOP PART OF THE CHART. AND THAT INCLUDED THE MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY TO DAY. OVER AGE SIXTY FIVE UNDER OR NINETEEN TWENTY FIVE AND THEN PREMIUM ASSISTANCE IN THAT CENTER AT. THAT FIGURES INCLUSIVE OF ALL THE ITEMS ON THAT ARE LISTED IN THIS ISSUE NUMBER ONE. IN ALL. OKAY WE. SINCE WE. ARE. OUR AGENDA DOESN'T HAVE YOUR. I LIKE TO AND MEN NOT EXCEPT FOR THE WORKFORCE PROPOSAL. I WOULDN'T CREATE ENDS DOES INCLUDE MORE THAN JUST THAT. OKAY. THROUGH. YEAH THEY THOUGHT THEY SAID THAT YOU ARE PART OF THAT QUESTION BUT IT WAS JUST FOR. YOU KNOW IT'S NOT JUST TO EXPANSION ITEMS LEVINE CLARIFIES OF THAT FIGURE I CITED IS ONLY FOR BETWEEN BOTH HOUSES THAT IT THEY. ITEMS THAT THEY APPROVED FOR HEALTH CARE EXPANSION. SO IN OTHER WORDS THAT. LAST ITEM CALLED ONE. UNDER ASSEMBLY FOR HEALTH CARE WORK FORCES NO I. IN THAT TOTAL. I'M LOOKING BACK AT ISSUE ONE. DILLON ISSUE ONE. ALRIGHT. YEAH. IN ALL THOSE NUMBERS OPERATE. SO YOU DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS NOW THOUGH I DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND IT STILL. THANK YOU SENATOR. DR ARAMBULA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. YOU DON'T HAVE THE HONOR AND PRIVILEGE OF SHARING SOMEONE THIS YEAR AND I'M GONNA ATTRIBUTED QUOTE TUB SOMEONE A. I WAS TRYING TO FIND AT THIS WEEKEND ARE NOT CHAIR ON ANYONE SPECIFICALLY SAID BUT I BELIEVE IT'S ATTRIBUTED TO MARTIN LUTHER KING AND IT SEEMS APPROPRIATE FOR TODAY. THAT BUDGETS ARE NOT FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS THEY ARE PROFOUNDLY A MORAL ONE. AND HAVING CHAIRED SOMEONE WHERE. I BELIEVE THAT HEALTHCARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT AND HOLD THAT VALUE TRUE TO MY SOUL. AND STRUGGLE WHEN I FEEL AS IF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS NOT GIVEN US ACCURATE NUMBERS THROUGH THIS YEAR. NOW I HAD ASKED FOR MANY OF THE NUMBERS THAT WE ARE ARGUING HERE TODAY BEFORE THIS YEAR BEGAN AND HAVE NOT BEEN GIVEN NUMBERS UNTIL. JUST TODAY. IN SOME A BIT FRUSTRATED THAT FINANCE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE MORE ACCURATE NUMBER SO WE CAN MAKE THE APPROPRIATE DECISIONS. THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US NOW. PARTICULARLY AS WE LOOK AT HEALTH FOR ALL AS WELL AS LOOKING AT AGED AND DISABLED. AM STRUGGLING WITH A CHANGING NUMBERS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HEAR ON THE DYESS HAVE THE APPROPRIATE INFORMATION THAT'S BEFORE US. SO I WOULD LIKE TO FORMALLY ASK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IF YOU COULD TO FOLLOW UP WITH A MEETING WITH MY OFFICE AS WELL AS. ANY OTHERS THAT ARE CONFUSED ABOUT THE NUMBERS THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENTED HERE TODAY. SO THAT WE HAVE ACCURATE INFORMATION TO PROCESS AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE MAKING APPROPRIATE DECISIONS. GOING FORWARD. NEXT IF I CAN I'D LIKE TO. I DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH ALL THE SPECIFICS OF MANY OF THE CHARTS THAT WE HAVE BUT THERE ARE MANY OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE PROMOTED AND STILL STRONGLY WOULD LIKE TO ADVOCATE FOR. AND WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW UP WITH OUR STAFF IF POSSIBLE TO MAKE SURE THAT. OUR VOICES FROM SOMEONE IN THE ASSEMBLY OR HEARD. BUT DO YOU BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO REALLY LOOK AT OUR MORAL VALUES. IF WE'VE EXPANDED HEALTHCARE TO ALL KIDS WHAT WE SAY WHEN AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD TURNS NINETEEN. IF YOU VALUE THAT COR COHORT OF CALIFORNIANS. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY AGE? WHAT ARE OUR VALUES THAN? AND SO I BELIEVE WE AS A STATE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HOLD OUR VALUES TRUE. AND REALLY DO HOPE THOSE ONTHE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. WILL DO OUR UTMOST TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS BUDGET IS A MORAL DOCUMENT JUST AS MUCH AS IT IS A FINANCIAL NNOVA. SERGEANTS COULD WE ASK OUR LEADER. WE. THE. MY. IF YOU. VERY FEW. BROUGH ALL WE'RE GOING TO RECESS FOR TEN MINUTES THEN ASKED THE SERGEANTS TO VACATE THE CHAMBERS THANK YOU YEAH. WHAT THANK YOU JUST. DECLARING DAHLE AUDIENCE OUT OF ORDER. A PRE SHAPE THE SONG BUT. WE DO HAVE IMPORT BUSINESS SO. WE WILL BE ASKING DUH STORE JUST TO CLEAR THE ROOM AND WE WILL BE RECESSED THANK YOU THANK YOU WE ARE RECONVENING OUR BUDGET CONFERENCE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR YOUR. PATIENTS. OF WITH THAT I BELIEVE ARE WE STILL ON ISSUE ONE WITH THEIR ANY. REMAINING COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. OKAY I'M NOT SEEING INITIAL WE WILL GO TO. ISSUE TO HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE JASON CONCENTRA CELAYA STARTING ON ISSUE TO ON PAGE TWELVE OF YOUR AGENDA. BUT THIS IS THAT THIS IS A PACKAGE OF ACTIONS TAKEN BY BOTH HOUSES RELATED TO. HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE. A PROPOSALS OTHER PROPOSALS CUT ACROSS THREE DIFFERENT AGENCIES THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THE ALSO OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. A FOR THE SAKE OF TIME I WON'T WALK THROUGH A EACH PROPOSAL I I KNOW THAT YOU TOUCH ON SOME OF THIS IN YOUR OVERVIEW. OF BUT IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FOURTEEN YOU MIGHT FIND A TABLE HANDY WE PROPERTIES THAT TABLE THAT IS NOT ANOTHER SUMMARY OF THE DIFFERENT ACTIONS TAKEN BY EACH OF THE HOUSES AND BY THE GOVERNOR. IT'S RELATIVE TO. ON PROPOSALS THAT THE THE GOVERNOR MADE THAT BOTH HOUSES ALREADY ADOPTED SO FOR EXAMPLE. THERE ARE SOME ADDITIONAL BASED FUNDING ALREADY BEEN PROVIDED TO THE SONG BROWN PROGRAM THAT'S NOT INCLUDED IN THIS TABLE THAT'S ALREADY BEING ACTED ON IN THE IN THE STATE BUDGET. ON OUR MESSAGE HERE. IS WHAT DID FOR YOU DON'T REALLY CONSIDER WHAT PROBLEMS YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS THROUGH THESE VARIOUS PROPOSALS OUTREACH WHEN I DO THINKING ABOUT STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS. VARIOUS I HEALTHCARE SHORTAGES EITHER FOR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS OR MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS. TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT COME STATE WIDE SHORTAGES AND CAPACITY ISSUES. WE THINK WHAT ONE APPROACH YOU COULD TAKE IS TO FIND A MORE RESIDENCY SLOTS WHICH IS AN ACTION THAT BOTH HOUSES TAKE THOUGH THEY DO IT THROUGH FOR DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. THAT THAT WOULD BE THEM MOST DIRECT WAY TO ADDRESS CAPACITY ISSUES THE ONE THING WE WERE NOTE THOUGH IS THAT. OF A LOT OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE SLATED TO RECEIVE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDS ON GOING BEGINNING IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. DUE TO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S. I SEE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER THAT AS YOURS ARE FACTORING YOUR DECISIONS MOTHER NOT TO PROVIDE ONGOING SUPPORTER ONE TIME IN THE LEVEL OF SUPPORT TO PROVIDE. NOT TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN SHORTAGES IN SPECIFIC AREAS OR REGIONS OF THE STATE. OF FOR EXAMPLE IN RURAL AREAS FOR EXAMPLE. OUR YOU COULD CONSIDER A LOAN REPAYMENTS AS AN ALTERNATIVE POLICY LEVER THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU TO. A SERVER TARGET MORE SPECIFICALLY DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE STATE AND AND BE MORE TARGETED APPROACH RATHER THAN TRUSTING SHORTAGES OVERALL IN THE STATE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DISCUSSED IN ACOSTA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THIS IS AN AREA WHERE ACTUALLY THERE IS AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE ON. INVESTING ADDITIONAL DOLLARS FOR HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ALTHOUGH WE EACH DID IT IN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAYS. I WOULD KNOW THAT MOST OF THESE ARE REALLY A QUESTION OF OUR GENERAL FUND PRIORITIES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF AND THE WET PROGRAM IN THE PRIMARY CARE MENTAL HEALTH FELLOWSHIPS WHICH ARE BEING UTILIZED BY. USING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT PROGRAM FUNDING. I'M WE KNOW THAT THE ADMINISTRATION INCLUDED FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO EXPAND PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENCY SLOTS AND THE REASON FOR THE MINISTRATION THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS IMPORTANT IS THAT WE HAVE SOME STATISTICS THAT HEALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICES. ADMINISTRATION PROJECTS CALIFORNIA PSYCHIATRIST SHORTAGE WILL REACH BETWEEN SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY NINE AND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT BY THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AND THE REASON THAT SIGNIFICANT IS BECAUSE WE KNOW FROM NATIONAL DATA. THAT IN THE PAST YEAR AT LEAST A MILLION CALIFORNIANS HAVE HAD A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND WE DEFINE A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS IS SOMEBODY WHO HAS EXPERIENCED AN INTERFERENCE WITH SOME OF THEIR MAJOR LIFE ACTIVITIES. ON ORTON IT LIMITS THEM. LIFE ACTIVITIES AND SO THAT'S WHY WE INCLUDED THAT PROPOSAL JUMPING SLIGHTLY AHEAD IN THE AGENDA I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT ANOTHER COMPONENT PIECE OF THE ADMINISTRATION OFFERED IN THIS ROUND. WAS THAT WERE UTILIZING PROP FIFTY SIX DOLLARS FOR TWO HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. IN LOAN REPAYMENT FOR PROVIDERS AND UNDERSERVED AREAS ON FOR BOTH POSITION AND THEN TEST SO I THINK. THERE'S A GREEN ABOUT THE POLICY AREA WE'VE ALL DONE IT IN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAYS AND LOOKING AT SOME DIFFERENT. PROFESSIONS WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. TAKING THIS BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO TURN OVER TO SENATOR MITCHELL FOR SECOND I'LL DO THAT AFTER. ETCETERA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO. COMMAND THE. ADMINISTRATION'S FOCUS OUR HOME ON MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING. AND A PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENCY FUNDING UP AND DOWN THE STATE FRANKLY. WE TALK AND HAVE BEEN SPENT TALKING A LOT ABOUT THE CRISIS IN HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND SO. I JOIN THIS BODY IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN BUT THE CRISIS IN HEALTH CARE GENERALLY PALES IN COMPARISON TO THE. CRISIS IN MENTAL HEALTH CARE IN FUNDING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW WHAT BUT. FOR EXAMPLE IN SOME. INLAND PARTS OF THE STATE TO. THE NUMBER OF ESTIMATED NUMBER OF PSYCHIATRIST PER ONE HUNDRED IS ABOUT FIVE AS COMPARED TO. AN AVERAGE OF ALMOST FIFTEEN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE. THERE ARE ONLY THIRTEEN ABOUT THIRTEEN CHILD PSYCHIATRIST SERVING A POPULATION OF OVER SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND. AND THAT'S WHERE WE ARE. THE PROBLEM OF COURSE WITH THAT I AM ALL FOR EXPANDING A RESIDENCY DOLLARS THROUGH THE SONG BROWN PROGRAM BUT THE PROBLEM WITH THE SONG BROWN PROGRAM. IS THE AS PRIMARY CARE IS DEFINED. PRIMARY CARE DOES NOT INCLUDE. CYCAS PSYCHIATRIST IN PSYCHIATRIC. RESIDENCY PROGRAMS SO. WE CLEARLY A NEED TO DO MORE. IN ALL THESE AREAS BUTIN PARTICULAR. IN THE AREA OF MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING IN PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENCY FUNDING SO. OF FOR THAT MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANTED TO COMMEND. THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THEIR EFFORTS IN THIS REGARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER. DOCTOR RENTAL. THANK YOU I'VE ALSO. I'LL TRY NOT TO AGITATE THIS TIME AND HOPEFULLY NO ONE WILL SAYING AFTER I SPEAK. YOU KNOW I'M. BOB QUITE EXCITED ABOUT ADMINISTRATION'S WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE ON THIS TOPIC MATTER. AS WE HAVE INCREASED THE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE COVERED WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THE OTHER PART OF THE EQUATION THE PROVIDERS. WHO ARE CARING FOR THEM ARE ALSO BEING TRAINED? I WANTED TO DIG INTO THE DETAILS THOUGH IF I COULD OF BOTH THE SENATE PROPOSAL AND THEN OUT A LITTLE BIT OF. POTENTIAL PATH FORWARD IF I COULD. BUT THE SENATE HAS RECOMMENDED FIFTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME FOR MENTAL HEALTH GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION. AS WELL AS BOTH. FORTY MILLION ON GOING EACH YEAR. I'D LIKE US TO CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT THE FORTY MILLION THAT WE DID WITH AND PROP FIFTY SIX THAT. THE VOTERS HAD INTENDED FOR US TO SPEND WITHIN GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION MAY COME. FROM THIS FIFTY FIVE MILLION THAT THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING AND SPENDING THE EXCESS FIFTEEN MILLION INTO MENTAL HEALTH. AND MAKING THIS ON GOING NOT ONE TIME. BY DOING THE ONGOING WE CONTINUE TO MEET THE UNMET NEEDS THAT WE HAVE WITHIN PSYCHIATRY WHILE HELPING US TO BUILD THE PRIMARY WORKFORCE AND RESPECT THE VOTERS WHEN THEY SENT US THIS MONEY. WITH PROP FIFTY SIX. I'D ALSO LIKE TO ADD IF I CAN ON THE NET NECESSITY FOR THE WHAT FUNDING. IT'S NOT JUST ANDES BUT IT'S THE OTHER LEVELS OF PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES THAT WERE NEEDING AS WELL AS THE ABILITY TO BRING IN A DIVERSITY TO OUR WORK FORCE TO ENSURE THAT. THOSE WHO ARE CARING FOR OUR COMMUNITIES LOOK LIKE AND SOUND LIKE OUR COMMUNITIES. I'M. WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BETTER SUPPORT THE PROGRAMS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE. SO BOTH SONG BROWNING YOU SEE PRIME ARE WONDERFUL EXAMPLES OF. OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE HELPING TO MEET THE RURAL AND URBAN UNDERSERVED AREAS AND COMMUNITIES AND REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT THESE INCREASES IN FUNDING WILL HELP OUR COMMUNITY. SO WITH THAT I JUST WANTED TO ADD MY STRONG SUPPORT FOR WORKFORCE PROGRAMS THAT WILL HELP TO BRING BACK MORE PROVIDERS TO COMMUNITIES ALL THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. CENTER NIELSEN. THIS COSTA. SOME OF THESE. PSYCHIATRIC PROFESSIONALS ARE YOU CONSIDERING THEM TO BE DIRECTED TO THE COUNTIES OF WHERE THEY CAN BE. AFFORDING TREATMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR MANY OF THE REALIGNED POPULATION WHO HAVE BOTH SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT TO OF NOW. PLAGUED OUR E. OURS AND. AND THE COUNTIES WHERE THE JUST DO NOT HAVE THE TREATMENT CAPABILITIES IS IS THAT SOME OF THE PLAN. REALLY ARE PROPOSAL SIMPLY UP WITH AN EMPHASIS ON PUTTING OF THESE PROFESSIONALS AND UNDERSERVED AREAS WE DON'T GET INTO QUITE THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL. I I WOULD ARGUE THAT THAT'S AN AREA IF IT DOES WARRANT ATTENTION. THANK YOU SIR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I AM JUST TRYING TO. SURE I AM UNDERSTANDING. EVERYTHING. I AM I AM NOT TRYING OUT CERTAIN NUMBERS I'VE AND CLOSE. UP. BUT ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE. I'M TRYING OUT TO THE TWENTY SIX POINT FOR THE POINT SIX THE ONE MILLION. THE TEN MILLION AYE I WOULD ASSUME THAT'S. I'M THE THIRTY MILLION ON PAGE TWELVE DIVIDED BY THREE. AND THEN THE SEVENTEEN MILLION. I'M COMING UP WITH THAT. TWENTY SIX MILLION. PER YEAR BUT IS IT IS A DIFFERENT TIERED STRUCTURE THEN INSTEAD OF. TWENTY SIX TWENTY SIX POINT SIX IS AT SEVENTEEN. THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE SO WE FOUND IT IF I MEAN. I IT'S SEVENTEEN MILLION THIS YEAR SEVENTEEN MILLION NEXT YEAR AND IT'S ADDING A NOTHER YEAR TOTAL OF FIFTY MILLION AT THE END. SO IT A TOTAL OF EIGHTY FOUR MILITARY THIS OKAY THANK YOU. THE I AM I I. I'M NOT GOING FAST ENOUGH TO APOLOGIZE THAT TO KEEP UP WITH THESE GRAPHS PAGE. THOUGH IF THAT THE LA GOT IT I SEE IT IS. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE WITH ME I. I AM JUST CURIOUS THAN THE FIFTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME PER MENTAL HEALTH GRADUATE MEDICAL DEDUCTION. EACH. WE DON'T SHOW IT ON PAGE FIVE THAT YOU SHOWED IT TO THE ASSEMBLY DOES AS A REDUCTION OF THAT AMOUNT. THE ASSEMBLY TOOK A SEPARATE ACTION IN THE SENATE ON THAT ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL. SO ARE WE AND THE SENATE SIDE RECOMMENDING FIFTY FIVE MILLION OR. BECAUSE OF YOUR THE SENATE APPROVED THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL FOR THE FIFTY FIVE MILLION THE ASSEMBLY DID NOT. SO I I HEARD THAT THE COMMENT ABOUT THE NEED FOR MORE PSYCHIATRIC. PRACTITIONERS AND AN ORANGE COUNTY WITH OVER THREE MILLION PEOPLE. I WITH YOU SEE I THE OTHER. EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS WERE ONLY PRODUCING NINE PER YEAR. SO WE NEED TO DO A LITTLE BETTER. ESPECIALLY SINCE. WE'RE DOING A MUCH BETTER JOB BEING CONCERNED ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH. HERE IN SACRAMENTO SO WE NEED THAT PROVIDE CALORIE OVER THE HILL TO HELP OUT SO. I JUST WANT TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT THAT. IT SURE THAT WE DO FUND. AS AS BEST WE CAN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. SEEING NO OTHER COMMENTS. SENATE MITCHELL. THINK BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO ISSUE THREE I JUST WANT TO MAKE IT COME OUT OF WHAT. DOCTOR ARAMBULA ARAMBULA TO THINK THAT. YOU SOME WASTE TRIGGER THE. SOCIAL ACTION WE SAW TAKE PLACE HERE YOU THERE'S A NATIONAL MOVEMENT GOING ON ACROSS THE COUNTRY ON THE POOR PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN FOR THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF DR KING'S POOR PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN. AND SO THEY ARE FORTY STATE HOUSES. OVER FORTY DAYS THEY'RE EXPERIENCING SUSTAINED ACTION. BY ON MEMBERS OF THE CLERGY AND AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC WHO ARE ENGAGING WITH THEIR POLICYMAKERS ON MONDAYS WITH THEIR COLLIE MORAL MONDAYS ON TO TALK ABOUT ISSUES SURROUNDING POVERTY SO. I THINK SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES MEMBERS MAY PERHAPS SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE WERE AWARE OF THIS NATIONAL MOVEMENTS LIKE THOUGHT IT. APPROPRIATE TO PUT INTO CONTEXT. WHAT WE JUST EXPERIENCE DEAR AND SO IT'S CALLED THE POOR PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN MORAL MONDAYS FORTY STATES FORTY DAYS? THANK YOU SIR MITCHELL. THANK YOU. ALONG. AND WITH THAT WE WILL MOVE TO ISSUE THREE PROVIDER RATES PROP FIFTY SIX FOR MEDI CAL. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MADAM CHAIRMAN BEN JOHNSON WITH THE LA SHOW. ALL PROCEED TAKE GIVING A QUICK OVERVIEW OF SOME OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE HOUSES AND THEN JUMP INTO JUST A FEW COMMENTS IF. IF THAT WOULD. VERY EARLY OKAY GREG. SO WE DO HAVE A HANDOUT THAT IS PUBLISHED IN THE AGENDA. RIGHT AFTER PAGE SIXTEEN THAT AND MALFORMED BASIS OF MY REMARKS ARE ALL OF OUR SPEED TO IT RATHER QUICKLY. NOTE AT THE OUTSET THAT THE GOVERNOR DID. GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION INCLUDED A PROPOSAL TO EXTEND THE EXISTING PAYMENTS GOING FORWARD PUT SOME MONEY TO OFFSET GENERAL FUND AND TO PROPOSE SOME ADDITIONAL NEW SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS BUT DID NOT INCLUDE A DETAILED PROPOSAL. PROUD TO SPEND THAT AND THAT THERE WAS OVER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN UNSPENT FUNDING IN THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION. THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION PROPOSAL BASICALLY AS BUDGETED. AND WHILE INTENDING TO I THINK ULTIMATELY APPROVED A DETAILED SPENDING PLAN THAT INCREASES FUNDING FOR SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS THE ASSEMBLY ULTIMATELY DEFERRED APPROVAL OF A DETAILED PLAN TO THIS CONFERENCE COMMITTEE PROCESS. WOULD NOTE RE IT REAL QUICKLY THOUGH THAT THE ASSEMBLY DID APPROVE A SET OF ONGOING MEDI CAL RATE INCREASES USING GENERAL FUND AND SOME OF THESE RATE INCREASES CORRESPOND TO ACTIONS THAT THE SENATE TOOK USING PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDING. BUT TO PROVIDE FOR. THE HIGHER SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT SO FOR EXAMPLE. PEDIATRIC SUB ACUTE FACILITIES BOTH RECEIVED ABOUT BOTH WOULD RECEIVE PAYMENT BOMBS ONE USING GENERAL FUND IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THEN THE OTHER USING UP PROP FIFTY SIX IN THE SENATE. ON PAGE TWO OF THE HANDOUT I DESCRIBED THE SENATE'S A PROSE PROPOSAL ARE ACTION THE SENATE APPROVED AN AUGMENTED THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION PROPOSAL. SPECIFYING A WAY TO SPEND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS IN THE BUDGET FOR NEW PAYMENTS AND THEN AUGMENTING BEYOND THAT TO A TOTAL PACKAGE OF NEW SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS. OVER THE OVER THE EXISTING ONES OF FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN MILLION WHAT'S REALLY A FOCUS I'D SAY ON A PEDIATRIC MEDICAL CARE THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS GOING FOR THIS PURPOSE. SENATE ACTION ALSO PROVIDE SEVENTY MILLION FOR DENTAL SERVICES. AT WHICH IS SPLIT BETWEEN ADULT PREVENTIVE SERVICES AS WELL AS SERVICES FOR CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. DID THE SENATE ACTION WOULD MAKE THESE PAYMENTS ONGOING AND WOULD DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO APPLY FOR FEDERAL APPROVAL FOR TWO YEARS FOR ALL THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS. FINALLY ON A ONE TIME BASIS THE SENATE DEDICATES A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION. TO WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND HUNDRED FORTY FOUR MILLION TO A NEW PHYSICIAN INCENTIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM. UNDER. UNDER THIS UNDER NEW ESTIMATES OF PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX BEEN LAYING UP FROM THE ADMINISTRATION WE ESTIMATE THE SENATE WOULD LEAVE ACT A ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX. FUNDING ON SPENT AT THE END OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THIS IS REVISED FROM THE NUMBER THAT'S IN THE HAND OUT OF EIGHTY THREE MILLION. ON PAGE THREE WE ARE WE DETAIL THE GOVERNOR'S CONCEPTUAL PROPOSAL WHICH WAS RELEASED AFTER THE MAY REVISION. AND PART OF WHICH WAS RELEASED AFTER OUR COMPLETION OF THIS HANDOUT SO FEW THINGS HAVE CHANGED I APOLOGIZE. THIS PLAN INCLUDED A A PLAN FOR HOW TO SPEND THE TUNING THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS AS WELL AS WELL AS HOW TO SPEND A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE UNALLOCATED REVENUES. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION WOULD BE FOR PHYSICIAN SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS. BOOSTING THE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT THE EXISTING SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS AS WELL AS PROVIDING SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS FOR NEW SERVICES THAT OUT THAT WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL PACKAGE. A LOT OF THEM FOCUSED ON PEDIATRIC CARE AND SO FORTH. AND THE INTENT WOULD BE TO RAISE US SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS TO BETWEEN EIGHTY FIVE TO AT RISK. RAISE THE OVERALL PAYMENT FOR THESE SERVICES BETWEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND A HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE MEDICARE RATE. THE ADMINISTRATION ALSO RELEASED A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR DENTAL SERVICES SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT OR PROPOSAL. WHICH WOULD INCLUDE. SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS FOR DOLE PREVENTIVE SERVICES PERIODONTAL SERVICES DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES AND OTHERS AND THEN FINALLY THE. ADMINISTRATION INCLUDES. LOW FUNDING FOR A LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM OF BETWEEN HUNDRED FIFTEEN HUNDRED NINETY MILLION OF FOR PHYSICIANS AND THIRTY MILLION FOR DENTAL THIS WOULD BE ON OF WHAT. A ONE TIME BASIS AS WELL AS ALL THE OTHER SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS INCLUDED. WE ESTIMATE THAT THE ULTIMATELY. THERE WOULD BE BETWEEN FIFTY FOUR NINETY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. LEFT ON SPENT AT THE END OF EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FOLLOWING THE GOVERNOR'S NEW PROPOSAL AND NOW JUST IF I CAN JUMP TO JUST A FEW COMMENTS. THERE IS CONSIDERABLE WE FIND THAT THERE IS CONSIDERABLE OVERLAP BETWEEN THE SENATE AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S NEW PROPOSAL FOLK WITH THE FOCUS ON SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS UP PRIMARILY TOWARDS PEDIATRIC SERVICES. AND SO FORTH THE MAIN DIFFERENCES ARE ON THE AMOUNTS THE SENATE WOULD BE PROVIDED FOR UNDER TWENTY SEVEN MILLION BY TWO NEW PAYMENTS WHILE THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD PROVIDE SIX HUNDRED MILLION. THERE ARE SOME RELATIVELY MINOR DIFFERENCES IN DOLLAR TERMS. REGARDING WHAT SERVICES ARE FUNDING FUNDED PEDIATRIC DAY HEALTH IN THE SENATE FOR EXAMPLE WHICH WOULD NOT RECEIVE ANY ABOUT PAYMENT BOOSTS IN UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN. AND THEN NOT THE SENATE DOES PROVIDE. SENDS PLAN DOES PLACE A LITTLE MORE EMPHASIS ON CERTAIN SPECIALTY CARE AMONG PEDIATRICS I SUPPOSE THE ADMINISTRATION WHICH IS LARGELY FOCUSED ON PRIMARY CARE. AND THEN THE OF THE MAJOR OTHER DIFFERENCES THE ONGOING NATURE OF THE SENATE'S ACTION WITH THE TWO YEAR FEDERAL APPROVAL WE FIND THAT ALL OF THE TWO YEAR FEDERAL APPROVED PROVOKE PLANNED OUT CERTAINLY MAKES SENSE IN CONCEPT. BUT AS IT WOULD PREVENT SOME OF THE INTER DISRUPTIONS THAT HAVE OCCURRED. GEKI HAD GIVEN ONE YEAR APPROVAL AND RE APPROVAL TIME LINES UNDER. WITH THAT WE'D HAVE TO GO THROUGH WITH THE FED UP WHILE WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE. CONSIDER MAKING THIS. THIS FUNDING LIMITED TERM AS OPPOSED ONGOING. LIMITED TERM COULD. COULD MEAN MULTI YEAR SO THAT WE HAVE AN EXTENDED TIME PERIOD TO REALLY ASCERTAIN THE EFFECTS THAT THE PAYMENTS ARE HAVING ON IMPROVE ACCESS WITHIN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. AND SO WE WE WOULD THINK THAT THERE COULD BE AYE THEIR SCAN SOME CONSIDERATION THERE AND THEN FINALLY ARE GIVEN OUR INTEREST IN. EVALUATING IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE IMPACT THESE PAYMENTS ARE HAVING WE DO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATION TO. PRODUCER REPORT THAT DETAILS OF THE IMPACT THAT THE PAYMENTS ARE HAVING ON INCREASED ACCESS WITHIN MEDI CAL AGAIN FAILED TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU MISS COST. KAMALA BIFURCATE MY COMMENTS BY TALKING FIRST ABOUT SOME OF THE GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATIONS WHERE WE HAVE A DIFFERENCE FOR THE ASTHMA AND THEN I'LL GET INTO THAT. FIFTY SIX BECAUSE THEY THINK IT'S AN EASIER WAY TO. NOT GET LOST IN THE NUMBERS HERE SOME TO GIVE IT MY BEST. I'M WE AND HAVE ESTIMATES FOR JUST THE PROVIDER PAYMENT PORTION HERE ON THE GENERAL FUND SIDE BETWEEN BOTH HOUSES OF THE SEVENTEEN POINT SEVEN MILLION GENERAL FUND IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND TOTALING FIFTY ONE POINT FOUR MILLION GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. ON DIS DO NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL. FOR ADULT SERVICES IN SAN FRANCISCO SO THAT'S NOT INCLUDED IN THAT TOTAL NUMBER. MOVING ON TO THE PROP FIFTY SIX SIDE OF THE EQUATION. WE PROPOSED A ONE POINT TWO FOUR SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR PACKAGE MADE UP OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FOR PHYSICIAN SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS TWO HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION FOR DENTAL SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS. NINETY TWO POINT TWO MILLION FOR TARGETED RATE INCREASES TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION FOR LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAMS WHICH I TESTIFIED TO EARLIER. FOR PROVIDERS AND UNDERSERVED AREAS AND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION FOR MEDI CAL PROGRAM GROWTH. ON AS THE ANNALS IS NOTED WE WORKED UP POST ME REVISE WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON DEVELOPING A SUPPLEMENTAL PROP FIFTY. PROPOSAL WHICH I THINK THE ALICE HAS I'M LAID OUT NICELY ON I THINK WE WOULD JUST SAY THE OUR PACKAGE REALLY TARGETS INVESTMENTS TO INCREASE MEDI CAL PROVIDER PARTICIPATION. AND THAT WAS REALLY THE LINES THAT WE VIEWED OUR PROPOSAL THROUGH WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE WITHIN THE. DOCTOR AND. YOUR LAST COMMENT WAS. WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE METRICS TO TRACK FOLLOWING FORWARD. I WANTED TO. ADD TO WHAT THE LA O. SAID FOR THE NECESSITY FOR THE CONTINUITY OF THESE PROGRAMS. THAT DOING I'M ONE YEAR AT A TIME MAKES IT AWFULLY DIFFICULT TO BOTH. TRACK RESULTS AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE. GROUP THAT HAS CODES THAT WE'VE SELECTED ARE ENOUGH BEING EFFECTIVE. AND SO JUST WOULD ASK THE DEPARTMENT TO TRY TO HAVE A MULTI YEAR APPROACH DEALING WITH THESE RATES TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE. ACCURATE DATA GOING FORWARD. AM I DO WANT TO ADD IF I CAN A BIT OF CONCERN THAT. THE PHYSICIAN LOAN REPAYMENTS WHILE I'M QUITE SUPPORTIVE OF THEM SEEMED TO BE. A HEFTY NUMBER AND I'M WONDERING OF FINANCE HAS ANY CONCERNS OVER. THAT PROGRAM BEING OVER PRESCRIBED IS. IS THERE AND WHAT REALISTICALLY COULD WE ACCOMPLISH WHAT THESE ONE TIME FUNDS. SO I THINK THE IDEA BEHIND. THE AMOUNTS IS THAT WE WANTED TO PROVIDE A LARGE ENOUGH INCENTIVE SO THAT WE COULD. REPAY A LARGE A PORTION OF PROVIDERS LOANS THAT THERE INCENTIVIZE TO APPLY SO WE DON'T WANT TO GO OUT WITH A SOLICITATION FOR TO HAVE PEOPLE APPLY FOR AID AND THEN NOT GET ENOUGH APPLICATIONS IN. AND THEN THE OTHER THING THAT WE DID WAS THAT WE ARE PROPOSING. AS A NUMBER OF YEARS TO ENCUMBER THOSE FUNDS AND SO THERE IS NO EXPECTATION THAT THAT HUNDRED NINETY MILLION FOR POSITIONS IN THE THIRTY MILLION FOR DENNIS WILL ALL BE SPENT THE BUDGET YEAR. UT WE'RE GOING TO BUDGET FOR THOSE FUNDS IN THE BUDGET YEAR BUT WE'RE GONNA GIVE SEVERAL YEARS TO ENCUMBER AND AND HOPEFULLY I'M GET ALL THOSE FUNDS OUT THE DOOR TO PROVIDERS. AND I WOULD JUST NOTE OUR ESTIMATE IS THAT BASED ON THAT DOLLAR AMOUNT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO SERVE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY PHYSICIANS AND A HUNDRED DENTIST. I THINK YOU JUST TO ADD TO DOCTOR ELDERS MEMBERS LED A QUESTION COULD YOU ALSO JUST. GIVE US THE SAME JUSTIFICATION FOR THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS AS WELL AS THE ARE. NEW PAYMENTS FOR PRESENT PREVENTIVE SERVICES FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS. YEAH SO IN TERMS OF. JUST TO CLARIFY TARGETING ON THE WAY THAT WE DID WITH PREVENTIVE SERVICES SO. THIS WAS THE RESULT OF YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION WE WE HAD TARGETS FOR WHAT WE WANTED TO DO WE GET WE KNEW WE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT WE LIKELY WORKING TO SPEND ALL OF THE CURRENT YEAR AMOUNTS. AND WE. WE'RE GOING TO DEDICATE. AT THAT AN ADDITIONAL SET OF FUNDS IN THE BUDGET YEAR WHO WANTED TO RAMP UP BASED ON THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THE BUDGET CONDITIONS THAT WERE SET FORTH IN THE BUDGET BILL LAST YEAR. BUT WHAT WE DID WANT TO DO IS IS PRESUMED WHERE THAT MONEY SHOULD BE SPENT AND SO WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING STAKEHOLDERS AND AND LISTENING AND GETTING THAT FEEDBACK. AND. AND WHAT WE HEARD WAS YOU KNOW MORE ADULT PREVENTIVE AND THE DENTAL SIDE OF PARTICULAR ANASTASIA WAS A PROBLEM IN THE DENTAL SIDE. AND SO WE TRY TO REACT TO THAT FEEDBACK. ON THE PHYSICIAN SIDE. IT WAS ALSO A PREVENTIVE FOCUS AND AND. SO WE SPLIT THOSE CODES BETWEEN. NEW PATIENT CODES AND EXISTING PATIENT CODES BUT I'M PREVENTIVE SERVICES BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE WERE HEARING FROM. FROM THE PROVIDER COMMUNITY IN FROM STAKEHOLDERS. THANK YOU. SIMILAR. COMMISSION CHAIR. AND AS A MEMBER OF THE. SENATE. SUB ONE EDUCATION I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT THE GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION. THE FUNDING OF FORTY MILLION FROM PROP FIFTY SIX WE'D LIKE TO SEE THAT. DO WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO NOT BE. SIPHONED OFF SOMEWHERE ELSE I JUST WANNA PUT THAT ON THE RECORD. THANK YOU. THROUGH THE COMMENTS QUESTIONS. OKAY NOT SAYING ANYMORE WE'RE GOING TO GO DO ISSUE. FOR. ANTI DE PUBLIC GRANTS AND CALL US. AND I WILL FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAO'S ALAMO WITH THE LA L. ITEM FOUR OF YOUR AGENDA RELATES TO MAJOR HUMAN SERVICES PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY IN THE CAO WORKS PROGRAM THE SSI ASSIST P. PROGRAM. THE ADMINISTRATION DID NOT INCLUDE IT CHANGES TO THESE PROGRAMS GRANT LEVELS IN THE MAY REVISION AND THE ASSEMBLY TO NOT TAKE ACTION RELATED TO. TO GRANT LEVELS FOR THESE TWO PROGRAMS THE SENATE'S BUDGET PLAN HOWEVER INCLUDES. SEVERAL MAJOR ACTIONS RELATED TO CAL WORKS AS A SCIENTIST BICU THE TOTAL FIVE HUNDRED FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET YEAR. THE FIRST MAJOR ACTION THE SENATE'S BUDGET PLAN TAKES CREATION OF A NEW. SAFETY NET RESERVE ARE WITHIN THE RESERVE THERE WOULD BE TWO SUB ACCOUNTS ONE FOR THE COW WORKS PROGRAM. AND A SECOND FOR THE MEDICAL PROGRAM DESCENDANTS PLAN ALLOCATES ONE BILLION DOLLARS TO THE COW WORK SUB ACCOUNT OF THE SAFETY NET RESERVE. IN THESE FUNDS COULD BE USED IN FUTURE YEARS AT THE LEGISLATURE'S DISCRETION. TO OFFSET RISING COSTS IN THE COWARDS PROGRAM SHOULD THE CASELOAD INCREASE WHEN THE ECONOMY ENTERS A RECESSION IN THE FUTURE. THE SECOND MAJOR PROPOSAL IN THE SENATE BUDGET PLAN. IS. IS FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET YEAR FOR A THREE YEAR. CAL WORKS GRANT INCREASE PACKAGE THAT WOULD RAISE CAO WORKS GRANTS FOR ALL FAMILIES IN THE CAO WORKS PROGRAM TO AT LEAST FIFTY PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. HOME UNDER CURRENT LAW A FAMILY OF THREE IS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE MAXIMUM GRANT OF SEVEN HUNDRED FOURTEEN DOLLARS. AND THE SENATE'S PLAN WOULD INCREASE THAT. TWO ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO DOLLARS BY TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. THAT ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO DOLLARS. PER MONTH CORRESPONDS TO ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT OF WHAT WE ESTIMATE THE FPL WILL BE IN THAT YEAR. BUT. IN THE CAO WORKS PROGRAM ABOUT HALF OF CAO ORGANIZES INCLUDE AN ADULT FAMILY MEMBER WHO IS AN ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE AID SO IN THIS CASE MIGHT OF A FAMILY OF THREE. ARM BUT THEY WILL ONLY SEE OF A CASH GRANT THAT CORRESPONDS TO THE FAMILY OF TWO TYPICALLY TO CHILDREN. AND THE SENATE'S PROPOSAL PUT REYES GRANTS FOR THESE TYPES OF CASES TO AT LEAST FIFTY PERCENT OF THE FPL. ON THE THIRD MAJOR ACTION THE SENATE TOOK RELATES TO COLAS ARE THE ACTION WOULD. DOWN INCLUDES FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET YEAR TO REINSTATE THE ANNUAL COAL AND THE COWARDS PROGRAM IN ORDER TO KEEP GRANTS AT FIFTY PERCENT OF THE FPL. IT ALSO INCLUDES FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET YEAR TO REINSTATE AN ONGOING COLA IN THE SS I SS P. PROGRAM. OUR OFFICE DOES NOT HAVE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO THE SENATE'S ACTIONS HOW WE WOULD NOTE IN THE OUT YEAR. ESPECIALLY THE COW WORKS GRANT PACKAGE COST YOU INCREASE ABOVE THE BUDGET YOUR COSTS I'M WE ESTIMATE BY TIME THERE FULLY RAMPED UP. THE COSTS FOR BOTH A COWLICK STRAND INCREASES AND THE TO CALL ACTIONS WOULD BE TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS ON GOING. BY TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. ARMED. WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS AS ARE MY COLLEAGUES. THANK YOU MISCAST. AND IT'S GOING TO BRIEFLY JUST GO OVER THE THREE OF US SENATE ACTION AND THEN I'LL START WITH THE SAFETY NET RESERVE FUND THE ADMINISTRATION HAS LONG SUPPORTED ROBUST RESERVE FUND THAT WE BELIEVE THE SENATE HAS RIGHTLY IDENTIFIED AN ISSUE THAT DESERVES. ON BEING ADDRESSED THESE PROGRAMS FREQUENTLY CASELOAD IS INCREASING DURING A RECESSION WHICH IS ALSO WHEN THEY FACE PROGRAM CUTS SUMMER MY COMMENTS ON HOW THE HEALTH CARE. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY ON GOING COSTS THAT WE'VE CREATED IN THE BUDGET ARE COVERED AND THIS IS A TOOL. TO DO THAT. SECONDLY ON EITHER CAO WORKS OBVIOUSLY THERE'S TWO COMPONENTS HERE ONE IS A GRANT INCREASE AND THE OTHER IS A COLOSSAL START BY DISCUSSING THE GRANT INCREASE. AGAIN OUR ESTIMATES ARE SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN WHAT THE SENATE'S. PROVIDED FOR THE GRANT INCREASE THE ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES COST OF FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO MILLION IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ONE BILLION IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND ONE POINT FOUR BILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. TOTALING ONE POINT SIX AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. I'M ON THE COLE AS. I MET A COOL AS LIMIT YOUR FLEXIBILITY IN A BUDGET ITEM WE'VE OFTEN TALKED ABOUT THAT I'M AND WE WOULD NOTE AGAIN THAT WE THINK THE COST ESTIMATES ARE UNDERSTATED FOR THIS PORTION OF THE PROPOSAL. THE ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES ESTIMATES A GENERAL FUND BECAUSE OF FIFTY FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION IN NINETEEN TWENTY. TWO HUNDRED AND FIVE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY NINE POINT EIGHT MILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE POINT THREE MILLION IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND OBVIOUSLY THE GRANT AMOUNTS IN THE COLAS INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER IF THEY'RE BOTH ADOPTED WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. NICK QUESTIONS MISTER OBERNOLTE. SO MY QUESTION FOR THE LA JOH. ARE ABOUT THE SUB ACCOUNTS FOR THE CAL WORKS AND MEDI CAL RESERVE FUNDS. SO I MEAN I I THINK WE'RE ALL UNIFIED IN OUR DESIRE TO MAKE SURE THAT RESERVE WORK WE HAVE SOME HEALTHY RESERVES. AND. A. THAT WE HAVE VERY PROPOSALS IN THE BUDGET TO DO THAT. A I AM I CONFUSED ABOUT WHY WE WOULD NEED TO HAVE SPECIFIC SOME ACCOUNTS WITH RESERVES EARMARKED FOR SPECIFIC PROGRAMS BECAUSE THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF THE STATE WISHING ROBUST RESERVES AT THE STATE LEVEL. TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT. DOES THE STATE PROGRAMS ARE CUSHION AND IT'S NOT JUST CAL WORKS IN MEDI CAL ME WE CAN IDENTIFY DOZENS AND DOZENS. THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN THE EVENT OF RECESSION SO THE QUESTIONS OF WHY THESE. IT OFF WE GO DOWN THIS PATH IT'S LIKE GOING DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE WE CAN ESTABLISH SOME ACCOUNTS WITH YOUR MARKS FOR EVERY STATE PROGRAM BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE WHOLE POINT. OF DOING IT AT THE STATE LEVEL. I THINK IT'S ONLY MY MARK. CANTONS OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE UNCERTAINLY IT'S A POLICY DECISION WHETHER TO EARMARK PARTICULAR FINDS IN A RESERVE SUB ACCOUNT OR NOT TO DO SO. OBVIOUSLY RESERVES THAT ARE HELD AT THE US IF YOU'RE THE BSA WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR ANY PROGRAM WHERE. WHEREAS THIS IS NAM ESSENTIALLY A SIGNALING DEVICE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO USE TO SAY THAT IT'S DESIGNATING. SET OF PROGRAMS TO BE A HIGHER PRIORITY FOR PRESERVATION AND FUTURE RECESSION BUT AGAIN THAT'S THAT'S A COMPLETE POLICY CHOICE AND. UP THE LEGISLATURE'S DISCUSSION. OKAY I'M JUST. BOB WELCOME THE VERY STRONG PROPONENT OF HAVING ADEQUATE RESERVES BUT I'M HESITATE TO TAKE A STEP OF YOUR MARKING THEM FOR SPECIFIC PROGRAMS JUST BECAUSE. THERE'S NO DEFINITION OF WHERE THAT STOPS BECAUSE NEXT YEAR WE HAVE A COUPLE MORE COUPLE MORE AND THEN BECOMES VERY ON WITH. THANK YOU. CENTER SKINNER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. JUST COMMENT ON. SO. WE HOPEFULLY WILL NOT INTO EARTH THE TYPE OF RECESSION WE IN TWO WORDS AT THE POINT THAT I GOT ELECTED TO THE ASSEMBLY IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. IN YOU KNOW WE WERE IN DEFICIT MODE THROUGH TO. THINK TWELFTH MAY BE BEYOND TWELVE. BUT DEFINITELY TILL TWELVE. AND WE HAD TO CUT. OBVIOUSLY MULTIPLE AREAS THE STATE BUDGET. BUT AS. WAS ARTICULATED IN THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS SAFETY NET RESERVE. WE HAD TO CUT. THIS PART OF THE STATE BUDGET MEANING THE CAL WORKS AND THE OTHER. SAFETY NET PROGRAMS. AT THE SAME TIME THE NEED WAS GROWING SO WE IF IT'S THERE IT'S A. PERVERSE TYPE OF CIRCUMSTANCE IN THAT. WE. THIS IS THE ONE AREA WHERE WE CAN GUARANTEED THE NEED BECOMES GREATER. WHEN WE FACE A DEFICIT. OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE BUDGETS NEED IS NOT NECESSARILY GREATER DURING A DEFICIT. COURSE NO CUT IS FUN BUT THERE NEEDS ARE NOT NECESSARILY GREATER. WHERE IS THE CASELOAD FOR THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM GOES UP WHEN THERE IS A RECESSION BECAUSE USUALLY WE UNEMPLOYMENT GOES UP AND? SO I. I THINK. I'M SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF IT BECAUSE I THINK IT IS THE ONE AREA THE BUDGET THAT WE CAN PRETTY MUCH. GUARANTEE WILL HAVE A GREATER NEED IN THAT TIME. THEN OTHER BUDGETARY. THAN OTHER STATE. DEPARTMENTS. AND. TO. TO BE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE WE HAD NOTHING TO TURN TO TO DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT OUR CASELOAD WAS INCREASING DURING THAT RECESSIONARY TIMES. WAS REALLY A VERY HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE FOR MANY OF US. AND WE KNEW THAT WE HAD. A GROWING NUMBER OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WHO NEEDED SAFETY NET AND WE WERE NOT IN THE POSITION TO ASSIST THEM WHATSOEVER. AND SO I THINK THAT THE THE BENEFIT IF WE STRUCTURE SOMETHING LIKE HIS SAFETY NEVER SERVICE THAT GUARANTEES THAT WE WILL NOT BE. WELL IT DOESN'T GUARANTEE THAT WE BE ABLE TO SATISFY A FULL CASELOAD INCREASE BECAUSE WE CANNOT EVERY DETERMINE WHAT THE MAGNITUDE. OF THE FUTURE DOWNTURN MIGHT BE IT CERTAINLY WOULD GIVE US BETTER ABILITY TO RESPOND THAT WE HAD IN OUR LAST CIRCUMSTANCE. THANK YOU SIR GENERAL. THANK YOU MISTER I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW I MEAN I. GUESS THIS IS A COMMENT WE HAVE THE RAINY DAY FUND BUT THERE'S CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON. THE DIP THE WAY WE DEPOSIT MONEY THE AMOUNT OF THE DEPOSIT SO WE CAN ACCUMULATE IN THERE AND THEN THERE CERTAINLY RESTRICTIONS ON HOW WE WITHDRAW THAT MONEY GIVEN WHATEVER THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO. WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY MY UNDERSTANDING. TO BE CORRECTED. IS THAT THEY'RE ALSO RESTRICTIONS ON THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF DEPOSITS THAT WE CAN. PLACE IN THE IN THE SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY. WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES AND TRIGGERS THAN BEING. APPLICABLE. SO. CORRECT ME IF I IF I AM WRONG N A SECOND IF THOSE TWO STATEMENTS ARE CORRECT THEN. THIS ADDITIONAL RESERVE FUND GIVES US SUBMITTED FLEXIBILITY. IF NOTHING ELSE TO DEPOSIT MORE MONEY INTO A RESERVE. THAN WE MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE. NOW YOU CAN CORRECT. NO CORRECTION. THAT'S ALL I CARED SO JUST MAY BE A SLIGHT ADDITION OF CONTEXT IS THAT THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT THE CONSTITUTIONAL RAINY DAY FUND DOES HAVE A WOMEN ACCOUNT. OF TEN PERCENT OF GENERAL FUND REVENUES WERE AS THE AS A FEW OTHERS CAUTIONARY RESERVE DOES NOT HAVE A LIMIT. BUT IT DOES HAVE SOME PROVISIONS THAT WOULD TRIGGER REDUCTIONS IN THE SALES TAX RATE IF IT'S BALLOTS REACHES A CERTAIN THRESHOLD. SO IN OTHER WORDS AT SOME POINT THE TRIGGERS HIT SALES TAX RATES REDUCED AND CONSEQUENCES HAPPEN AS A RESULT SPECIFICALLY OUT SALES TAX GOES DOWN BUT THEN RESERVES WOULD ALSO GO DOWN AS A RESULT RIGHT. THANK YOU. FAMOUS TEACHER. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. OKAY SEEING NONE WE WILL MOVE. TO THE NEXT SECTION WHICH IS RESOURCES AND TRANSPORTATION. WE WILL START WITH ISSUE ONE. AND SUSTAINABLE FUNDING FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE THAT I GUESS BEFORE WE GET THERE. WE WILL HAVE A QUICK OVERVIEW OF RESOURCES AND TRANSPORTATION. AND THAT WE ALL FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON BRIAN BROWN OF THE ANALYST'S OFFICE WELL. EIGHT. DO A VERY QUICK OVERVIEW OF TO TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT ON. THE SAID IN THE ASSEMBLY IS A RESOURCE AND TRANSPORTATION BUDGET HOW COMPARES TO THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL THROUGH MAY REVISION. IT'S ON PAGE FIVE OF YOUR AGENDA AYE I THINK THE BIG PICTURE HERE IS THAT BOTH THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY. ADOPTED NOT ONLY MOST OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S OF PROPOSALS AND RESOURCES AND TRANSPORTATION BUT MOST OF THE BIG PROPOSALS AND SO THOSE ARE SUMMARIZED. ON PAGES FIVE AND SIX. DIG RUNNING THREE REALLY QUICKLY BUT THAT INCLUDES OVER A BILLION DOLLARS IN PROPOSITION SIXTY A. RESOURCE THE BOND FUNDING THAT'S THE THE MEASURE THIS ON THE BALLOT TOMORROW. CLOSE TO A BILLION DOLLARS IN HIGHWAY REHABILITATION AND MAINTENANCE I MEAN THOSE REVENUES PROVIDED BY SB ONE LAST YEAR. I THINK CLUES OF FUNDING FOR TO JUST A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT IN THE PARKS DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS TO AUGMENT TO INCREASE SERVICE LEVELS AT STATE PARKS. AS WELL AS. HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND FOR TOTAL TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS POTENTIALLY FOR THE CREATION OF THE CALIFORNIA INDIAN HERITAGE CENTER. CLOSE TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR FLOOD PROTECTION FUNDING INCLUDING SOME ONGOING GENERAL FUND RESOURCES. AND ALSO IN LIGHT OF THE SEVERE FIRES THIS LAST YEAR THERE'S FUNDING IN THE BUDGET APPROVED BY BOTH HOUSES FOR FIRE PROTECTION. AS WELL AS FORESTRY AND OTHER. FORCE HEALTH RELATED ACTIVITIES. ON ONE PAGE SEVEN IN ANY JUST TO HIGHLIGHT THEN REALLY YOUR DEEDS AND THE ISSUE THAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU TODAY THAT YOU'RE GONNA HERE ARE REALLY THE. HANDFUL OF KEY ISSUES WHERE THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN% THE HOUSES AS WELL AS BETWEEN THE HOUSES IN THE ADMINISTRATION AND A COUPLE OF THOSE WE CHARACTERIZE IT WILL BE IN ONES THAT ARE REALLY FINE FUNDAMENTALLY ABOUT. DIFFERENT FUNDING PRIORITIES SO THE CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN IS ONE WHERE ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME. CLOSE SIMILARITY TO WHAT WAS PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION EACH HOUSE HAD A DIFFERENT SET OF PROGRAMS THAT YOU PRIORITIZE. WITH CAP AND TRADE REVENUES ALSO THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE THEIR HISTORICAL FUNDING. DEFICIT THERE OF EACH HOUSE ADDRESS IN SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT WAYS. AND LASTLY ON PAGE EIGHT THERE A COUPLE OF ISSUES THAT YOU'RE GONNA HEAR TODAY THAT WHILE THERE ARE. FUNDING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE HOUSE IS REALLY IN SOME WAYS FUNDAMENTALLY THERE ABOUT POLICY QUESTIONS THAT'S TO YOUR MISSION VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN. WHERE? IN IN PART ONE OF THE ISSUES THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED ADDITIONAL TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT YOU HEAR ABOUT PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DIRECTION. TO THE ADMINISTRATION ON HOW TO IMPLEMENT. AND MEETS A DIFFERENT GOAL TO BE ESTABLISHED. AND IN ACCORD WITH THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FIND. QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER AND AT WHAT LEVEL TO ESTABLISH NEW CHARGES ON DRINKING WATER CONSUMERS AND AGRICULTURAL ENTITIES TO FIND. THE PROVISION OF SAFE DRINKING WATER AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. WITHOUT HAVING TAKE QUESTIONS THAT OTHERWISE CAN JUMP ON IN THE FIRST ISSUE. THANK YOU MS COSTA. ALL THE FOR MY COMMENTS TO THE FIRST ISSUE THINKING. THANK YOU WHEN WE COMMENCE WITH ISSUE ONE. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON RATE SAILORS WITH ANALYST'S OFFICE THE ISSUE BEFORE THE COMMITTEE IS HOW MUCH MONEY TO PROVIDE FOR ONGOING ACTIVITIES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED AN ONGOING AUGMENTATION OF FIFTY POINT SIX MILLION OF THIS ABOUT TWENTY MILLION WAS TO ADDRESS AN ONGOING STRUCTURAL DEFICIT AT THE DEPARTMENT AND THE. OTHER THIRTY MILLION WAS FOR AN EXPANSION OF ONGOING ACTIVITIES AT THE DEPARTMENT. GOVERNOR MIGHT HAVE RELIED PRIMARILY ON TRANSPORTATION RELATED FUNDING FROM THE MOTOR VEHICLE COUNT ENTIRE RECYCLING FUND FOR THOSE AUGMENTATIONS WITH THE RATIONALE THAT VEHICLES AND ROADS HAVE IMPACTS ON FISH AND WILDLIFE. BOTH HOUSES REJECTED THE USE OF THOSE TRANSPORTATION FUNDS BOTH HOUSES PROVIDED LOWER AMOUNTS OF MONEY BOTH HOUSES REPEAT BAD RELIED EXCLUSIVELY ON THE GENERAL FUND. AND BOTH HOUSES PROVIDED LIMITED TERM FUNDING FOR THE DEPARTMENT SO SHOWN IN YOUR AGENDA THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDED THIRTY SIX POINT SIX MILLION FOR TWO YEARS. AND THE SENATE PROVIDED TWENTY THREE POINT FOUR MILLION FOR ONE YEAR BOTH HOUSES ALSO ADOPTED LANGUAGE REQUIRING THAT THE DEPARTMENT CONTRACT OUT FOR A BUDGET AUDIT. BY THE SENATE SPECIFICALLY SET ASIDE FOR MILLION FROM THE AMOUNT THEY PROVIDED FOR THAT AUDIT. SO WE DO HAVE A COMPROMISE TO RECOMMEND HERE FOR THIS ITEM AND THAT IS TO PROVIDE NINETEEN POINT SIX MILLION GENERAL FUND. BUT DIVIDE PROVIDED ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO ADDRESS THAT OPERATING SHORTFALL AT THE DEPARTMENT THIS WOULD ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO CONTINUE THEIR EXISTING ACTIVITIES PROVIDE CERTAINTY FOR THEM AND AVOID HAVING THE LEGISLATURE HAVING TO REVISIT THIS ISSUE AGAIN. IN THE COMING YEARS. WE DO ALSO RECOMMEND PROVIDING FUNDING FOR THIS BUDGETARY AUDIT THE BOTH HOUSES ADOPTED WEAVING THAT WOULD ANSWER SOME KEY QUESTIONS THAT HAVE. BEEN RECURRING ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT'S BUDGET AND. WHAT REVENUES SUPPORT WHICH ACTIVITIES AND WHAT TYPES OF ONGOING ACTIVITIES AND STATUTORY RESPONSIBILITIES THEY'RE NOT MEETING AT THIS TIME MEANS SENATE STAFFER CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF WORKING ON AN ESTIMATE FOR HOW MUCH THAT TYPE OF AUDIT AND POTENTIALLY? NAM IT SYSTEM TO TRACK THE BUDGET WOULD COST. IF YOU. THIS COST. IF YOU MISTER CHAIRED THIS IS NOT A NEW ISSUE I WOULD COME TO YOU IN THE PAST WITH OTHER PROPOSALS TO DEAL WITH THAT HAD STRUCTURAL BUDGETARY ISSUES THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS FACING. A IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR OVERALL BUDGET FRAMEWORK WE DID NOT INCREASE GENERAL FUND SPENDING ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND AS SUCH ARE PROPOSAL LIMITED THE GENERAL FUND INCLUSION TO SIX POINT SIX AND UTILIZE THE MOTOR VEHICLE COUNTY THE TIRE MANAGEMENT RECYCLING FUND. TO BRING. THEIR BUDGET. IN LINE AND MAKE IT STRUCTURALLY SOUND WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE ALLEY AS COMPROMISE OF UTILIZING CAPTURE GENERAL FUND. WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE ENTIRE FISCAL PLAN OF THE BUDGET BECAUSE CLEARLY WE DIDN'T INCLUDE GENERAL FUND IN OUR PROPOSAL. ON AND LASTLY AS NOTED AND BOTH HOUSES HAVE REQUESTED AN INDEPENDENT SERVICE BATES BUDGET REVIEW AND THE ADMINISTRATION IS TO OPEN TO THOSE FURTHERING CONVERSATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS. WITH THAT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. MR DOT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THE FIRST QUESTION I HAVE IS FOR THEM ALEJO I. DON'T UNDERSTAND THE. DELTA BETWEEN YOUR COMPROMISE PROPOSAL AND THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING WHICH BY. ALL ASSESSMENTS FOR BOTH ON THE SENATE AT LEAST I THINK ON THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY SIDE THERE WAS GENERAL AGREEMENT ABOUT. THE EVENTUAL. NEED FOR A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ONGOING AMOUNT IN ORDER FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO ACHIEVE ITS ITS GOALS HOWEVER WE HELD BACK ON THAT SUBJECT TO. A. AT AND AND AUDIT LIKE STATE PARKS HAD. UP A FEW YEARS AGO AND AND TO. HAD VERY SUCCESSFUL RESULTS FROM SO CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR GAP SURE. AND I THINK OUR INTENTION WAS TO TRY AND AND START WITH WHAT EACH HOUSE DIDN'T AND WORK TOGETHER BETWEEN THOSE RATHER THAN STARTING FROM THE ADMINISTRATION GIVEN WHAT BOTH HOUSES. HAD ADOPTED WE THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE SOME ONGOING SUPPORT FOR THE EXISTING ACTIVITIES OF THE DEPARTMENT COULD RELY ON BEING ABLE TO CONTINUE THOSE. AND THEN AS YOU SAY CONDITIONS THE ADOPTION OF ADDITIONAL REVENUES IN THE FUTURE BASED ON THE FINDINGS OF THAT AUDIT. SO MMHM ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO CONTINUE. WITH CERTAINTY THEIR CURRENT ACTIVITIES AND THEN FIND OUT THROUGH THIS AUDIT WHAT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE NECESSARY TO MEET THEIR STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS. THANK YOU UP AND FOR THE ADMINISTRATION THERE'S BEEN A A. GOOD DEAL OF CONTROVERSY AROUND. OF THE. MOTOR VEHICLE COUNTERTERRORIST CYCLING FUN HAVING BEEN. IDENTIFIED BY THE ADMINISTRATION AS FUNDING SOURCE I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD PROVIDE US WITH SOME INSIGHT AS TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S THINKING ON WHAT THOSE ARE. APPROPRIATE TO. PLACES TO GO. AND THEN. WHY NOT GENERAL FUND WOULD BE MY FOLLOW UP QUESTION? THOSE ARE DRAGGED OVER THE PART OF FINANCE SO THERE WAS. REPORTING TWENTY SIXTEEN BY UC DAVIS WHICH DID ESTIMATE THE COST OF WILDLIFE VEHICLE CONFLICT. AT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION ANNUALLY THIRTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE THERE IS AN IMPACT TO WILDLIFE WITH VEHICLES WHICH IS THE NEXT IF. THE DEPARTMENT I HAVE TO AND YOU RESPOND TO TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS INVOLVING WOUNDED WILDLIFE. THEY RESPOND TO TH BILLS CAUSED BY VEHICLES ON ROADWAYS. THEY ALSO DO HAVE TO. RESPOND TO MOTOR VEHICLE COLLISIONS AND ENGAGE IN ENFORCEMENT OF THE MORE COULD BE ABLE CODE AS WE DO BELIEVE THERE IS A CLEAR NEXUS. BETWEEN OUR VEHICLE AND WHILE A CONFLICT. AND THE TIRE RECYCLING FUN. SO THE TIRE IS WHAT WE CONSIDER A PROXY TO THE VEHICLE. A CONFLICT AND A VEHICLE IMPACT AS WE SEE THE MOTOR VEHICLE CAO AND THEIR TIRES LIKELY FIND BOWS AS THE. A NEXUS TO VEHICLES. AND IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION THAT THERE ARE ENOUGH FUNDS. TO BOTH ACHIEVE. THE GOALS. DATA UP FISH AND WILDLIFE NADER AT LEAST YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING. AND THE ONGOING AND FUTURE NEEDS OF FOUR. OF THOSE AGENCIES THAT ALSO ARE RELYING ON THE SPOT. MAN ARMY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO WHAT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED HERE ISN'T PERSPECTIVE FOR THE TIRE RECYCLING FUND FOR EXAMPLE IS TRUE THAT THOSE EXISTING. FUNDS ARE. SUPPORT THE CARL MOYER PROGRAM BUT PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL IS TO FULLY FUNDED FULLY BACK FILL THE CARL MOYER PROGRAM WITH CAP AND TRADE FUNDS. SO AS PART OF THIS PROPOSAL THERE ARE NO PROGRAM REDUCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH FEES THERE'S A CLEAR PROGRAMMATIC NEXUS AND IT NOT ONLY ADDRESSES THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT. WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT BUT IT ALSO ADDRESSES WHAT WE WOULD CALL NO REGRETS PROGRAM ENHANCEMENTS THAT. THROUGH LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION WHICH ASKED THE DEPARTMENT TO CONVENE THAT STAKEHOLDERS IDENTIFIED THESE. KINDA CORE MISSION RESPONSIBILITIES OF THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. DE AND YEAH AND. AS MISTER AGUILAR SAID. DOES RELATE TO TRANSPORTATION. IS IT ENVISIONED UP CAP AND TRADE BACK FILL WOULD BE ONGOING. THAT IS CORRECT IT WOULD BE BUILT INTO THE. BASELINE. I WANT TO. HAPPENS BUT. CAP AND TRADE DOESN'T. KEEP UP CURRENT RIGHT. SO BECAUSE IT WOULD BE PART OF THE BASELINE WHICH WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE FUNDED IN THE BASELINE OF FOR EXAMPLE. LAST YEAR. BASED ON THE LEGISLATIVE REAUTHORIZATION A CAP AND TRADE PROVIDED ON GOING. GRF FUNDS TO BACK FILL CAL FIRES ES ARRAY FUND. THAT WOULD BE ESSENTIALLY FUNDS THAT ARE CONTINUING IN THE BASE AND ENOUGH. CAPITA TRADE OPTIONS ARE LESS THEN. THAT WOULD AFFECT THE SO CALLED DISCRETIONARY FORTY PERCENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERS. EACH YEAR. THANK YOU AND. I HAVE ONE OTHER QUESTION. THAT I DON'T THINK ANYBODY. WHY NOT GENERAL FUND? THEY CAN GO. I'M AS I SAID I THINK WE BUILD OUR BUDGET AND IN JANUARY AND IN THE MAY REVISE AND REALLY LIMITED ON GOING GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES THAT THROUGHOUT ALL PROGRAMS AND YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY I OFTEN WE THINK THE RISKS ARE GREATER. ON AND MADE AND THEY WERE IN JANUARY SPECIFICALLY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S. AND SO ONE OF THE VERY FIRST THINGS WE DO FOR ANY PROPOSAL IS SEE IF THERE ARE APPROPRIATE SPECIAL FUNDS. A AND IN THIS CASE WE FELT THERE WAS A STRONG NEXUS THAT WOULD. HUB PROVIDE SUSTAIN FUNDING FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE AS WELL AS EXPANDS. THEIR MISSION WHICH OVER THE YEARS HAS GREATLY EXPANDED ON TO PUT THEM ON A SUSTAINABLE FINANCIAL AYE PATH FORWARD. THANK YOU AND I DO I DO APPRECIATE THE. OPENNESS TO. CONDUCTING AN AUDIT TO THE FOOT OF. OFFICIAL WILDLIFE IT THINK IT'LL BE HELPFUL. THANK YOU ETCETERA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YOU KNOW. DOWN WHERE I COME FROM PEOPLE ARE SORT OF INTERESTED IN HAVING. TRANSPORTATION AND TRANSPORTATION RELATED FEES. USED FOR TRANSPORTATION PURPOSES ONLY BEEN HEARING A LOT ABOUT THAT AND I'M SURE WE'LL BE WATCHING A LOT ABOUT THAT TOMORROW. I'M I'M JUST CURIOUS HOW MUCH DOES THE DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY SPEND.- A YEAR IN RESPONDING TO ACCIDENTS ON OUR HIGHWAYS INVOLVING WILDLIFE. I THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THE MAIN ISSUES A CHIU. USED TO CONNECT THE. DIEM VIENEN. TIRE FEET TO THE FUNDING FOR THE DEPARTMENT. YEAH SO FOR THE CURRENT. ONGOING PROGRAM VENTURES ABOUT FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY THAT THE CARS SPEND ON VEHICLE WILDLIFE CONFLICT. YOU SAID THE DEPARTMENT SPENDS FORTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ON. TRUCK TRAFFIC RELATED ISSUES. I I THINK TO A. JUST TO CLARIFY WE PROVIDED THIS INFORMATION TO BOTH THE LA OWINGS WELL AS TO LIKE STAFF WOULD BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE IT AGAIN. THE DEPARTMENT WENT THROUGH KIND OF AN ITEMIZED LINE BY LINE. LIST OF. ACTIVITIES. RELATED TO TRANSPORTATION AND IF YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THEIR BASELINE EXPENDITURES. THEY SPEND ABOUT FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS OF FOR TRANSPORTATION RELATED ACTIVITIES. AND THAT'S THE BASIS OF OUR. OF OUR PROPOSAL WHERE ESSENTIALLY ASKING FOR A TOTAL OF. ABOUT THIRTY SIX MILLION. FOR THAT PURPOSE I DON'T HAVE IT HERE IN FRONT OF ME WHAT'S THE DEPARTMENTS THE DEPARTMENT'S ANNUAL BUDGET. AROUND SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS HERE. OKAY SO. LESS THAN TEN PERCENT. THEY SPEND ON A TRAFFIC RELATED. IF. AND SENATOR JUST TO CLARIFY THE INFORMATION THE DEPARTMENT PROVIDED IT'S NOT JUST VEHICLES HITTING WILDLIFE AND NEEDING TO DEAL WITH THAT THEY WENT THROUGH A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE IT'S ALSO TIME THEIR WARDENS WHO WHO SERVE AS SOME KIND OF. CLUB CHP TYPE ROLE IN CERTAIN AREAS THEIR SWORN PEACE OFFICERS IT'S ALSO PLANNING FOR WHERE ROADS ARE GONNA GO. SO THERE WERE VARIETY OF IMPACTS THAT THEY WENT THROUGH AND ANALYZE THAT THEY BELIEVED WERE. HAD A NEXUS WITH TRANSPORTATION NOT JUST THE WILDLIFE AND CAR INCIDENTS. WELL THIS IS CLEARLY A POLICY ISSUE THAT'S GOING TO. REQUIRE A MUCH MORE EXTENDED DEBATE THEN WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IN HERE I THINK PROBABLY IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE AN ALL. HAVE SOME POLICY DISCUSSION ON HOW WE USED THESE. TRANSPORTATION RELATED FEES AND FRANKLY MAKE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC KNOWS. OF THAT THESE FEES ARE BEING USED FOR THAT PURPOSE AND HAVE SOME FEEDBACK AS TO WHETHER THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE THEY WANT. THEIR FEES TO GO SO I DO I DO. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE DEPARTMENT IS NOT ABLE TO. SORT OF RESTRUCTURING ITSELF TO PROVIDE SOME DEGREE OF SOLVENCY SO. I'LL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE RESULTS OF THE AUDIT. WHEN WE GET IT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU SIR NIELSEN. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS AND. FOLKS OUT THERE. THEN I'M TALKING TO. THE PUBLIC. THIS IS AN ISSUE OF TRUST AND WE GET BACK TO IT AGAIN. TAKING MONEY THAT THE PUBLIC IS BEEN PROMISED WE'RE GONNA GO TO SAY STREETS ROADS AND HIGHWAYS AND USING IT FOR OTHER PURPOSES. OR THE TIRE FREE. SUPPOSED TO BE A RECYCLING. FUND. AND IN VETTING CREATIVE WAYS TO DIRECT THE MONEY IN OTHER DIRECTIONS. I SUBMIT THE PUBLIC GET PRETTY MAD ABOUT THIS. WE JUST LEARNED EARLIER IN THE SUBCOMMITTEE UP A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY. GOING INTO PARKS. OUT OF SB ONE. NO WE ALREADY KNEW THERE WERE SOME. BUT HERE IS A SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL AMOUNT. AND I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT ON THE LEGISLATURE. TO SHINE THE SPOTLIGHT. UNDIES MISDIRECTED FUNDS. WHERE THE TRUSTED THE PUBLIC HAS BEEN VIOLATED? THEY HAVE A THOUGHT FOR EXAMPLE THAT. ONE MONEY. S. B. ONE MONEY WAS GOING TO GO ALL INDUSTRIES ROADS AND HIGHWAYS. THAT CLEARLY IS NOT THE CASE. GOING BACK EVEN FURTHER THE FIRE TAX. THAT WAS TO GOING TO PREVENTION. AN EX EXCESSIVE YEARS AND INQUIRIES AND COMMITTEE TO OF CAL FIRE. WAS VERY EVIDENT. LITTLE OF THAT MONEY OF MOST OF IT WAS NOT GOING INTO CANNOT BE TOLERATED. AND MAYBE HE IN THIS COMMITTEE HERE THIS YEAR. IT'S TIME TO TAKE A STAND. AND KEEP FAITH WITH VOTERS AND QUIT PLAYING GAMES WITH THEIR MONEY. THANK YOU SEVERAL. YOU MISTER CHAIR WHAT ARE ON PAGE THREE WE HAVE A DISCUSSION OF PROP SIXTY EIGHT. AND WE ALSO HAVE PARKS FUNDING IN THEIR SORT OF RELATED. AND SO. I KNOW OF I MIGHT BE GETTING INTO THE WEEDS OUT RELYING YOU TO DIRECT TRAFFIC MAYBE I'M BRINGING THIS UP AT THE WRONG TIME. BUT. THERE IS SUPPOSE TO BE SOME FUNDING FOR CAL EXPO. OUT OF PROP SIXTY EIGHT. THERE'S ALSO BEEN. A PROPOSAL OUT OF THE ASSEMBLY FOR SOME FUNDING TO DO AN ASSESSMENT OF THEIR. INFRASTRUCTURE AND I'M WONDERING IF IT'S JUST THE RIGHT PLACE TO BRING OUT AND WE WILL BE BRINGING UP THOSE ITEMS. AT A LATER DATE. YEAH I YOU COULD FEEL FREE TO ADDRESS MR PART OF LARGER CONTEXT BUT WE WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT AND WHAT DOES YOUR HELP ME I'M JUST I JUST WANT TO LIKE LEVEL BY SO I APOLOGIZE. BUT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN CHRISTIAN SAYING WEDNESDAY. WEDNESDAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU. OKAY WERE NOT DRESSING ANYTHING ELSE RELATED ISSUE TO. SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. I. FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WITH A. L. L. WHEN YOU'RE READY. OR. CHAU MY WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE BUT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES A TOTAL OF FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS AND THIRTY POSITIONS. TO BE FUNDED FROM A LINE FROM THE UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANK CLEANUP FUND IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FIND. BY THE GOVERNOR ALSO PROPOSES TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO CREATE THE PROGRAM THAT WOULD PRIMARILY ASSIST SMALL DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. I'D TO PAY FOR ONGOING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE OTHER THAT WATER SYSTEMS. THE MONEY'S COMING INTO THE FINAL A COME MAINLY FROM CHARGES ON WATER SYSTEM CUSTOMER SUCH AS HOMEOWNERS. WHO EXAMPLE THEY PAY NINETY FIVE CENTS A MONTH AND THAT IS DISSIPATED TO RAISE APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR WHEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED? OTHER FUNDS WE COME FROM CHARGES ON AGRICULTURAL ENTITIES FOR EXAMPLE THE. FERTILIZER MILL FEE WOULD BE INCREASED THAT WOULD GENERATE ABOUT FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR WHEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED. AND ALSO NOT PRODUCERS WOULD PAY AT A CHARGE THAT WOULD GENERATE DECIMATED TO GENERATE ABOUT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. THAT I ASSEMBLY REJECTED THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL AND ADOPTED PLACEHOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE RELATED TO DRESSING WATER POLLUTION CLEANUP EFFORTS.% THAT ALSO APPROVED A ONE TIME LINE OF FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION FROM THE UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANK CLEAN UP FRONT TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FUND. THE SENATE APPROVED ONE POINT SIX MILLION GENERAL FUND IN NINE POSITIONS FOR TWO YEARS FOR TWO PURPOSES. ONE IS TO DEVELOP A MAP OF AQUIFER'S THEY'RE AT HIGH RISK OF CONTAINING CONTAMINANTS. AND THAT ARE LIKELY TO BE USED AS A SOURCE OF DRINKING WATER. AND TO PREPARE AND ASSESSMENT OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF ANNUAL FUNDING NEEDED. TO ASSIST WATER SYSTEMS TO DELIVER SAFE DRINKING WATER SO THE SENATE'S APPROACH IS MORE ALONG THE LINES OF DOING A STUDY. TO GET A BETTER ESTIMATES OF THE SCOPE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM IT WHAT IT WOULD COST TO ADDRESS IT. THE SENATE ALSO APPROVED FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND WHEN TIME FOR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. HAD APPROVED FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS PROPOSITION TWO BEGINNING IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY AND ONGOING FOR DRINKING WATER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A BILL SENATE BILL SIX TWENTY THREE BY SENATOR MINING THAT IS CURRENTLY IN THE ASSEMBLY AND IT'S THE BASIS FOR THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT'S BEEN PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. A SO WHEN APPROACH THE ACT THE COMMITTEE COULD TAKE WOULD BE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE THROUGH THE POLICY COMMITTEE PROCESS HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISS COST. ALTHOUGH NEITHER HOUSE APPROVED THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE SIGNIFICANT INTEREST IN CONTINUING NEEDS DISCUSSIONS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT. THANK YOU CENTER NIELSEN. MISTER CHAIRMAN I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT TO. THE. ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL WAS REJECTED FOR GOOD CAUSE. AT I WOULD NOT LIKE TO SEE THAT BE REVISITED. I THINK THAT THAT IS THE IMPOSITION OF ATTACKS THAT TO. THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE. AND. THERE ARE OTHER WAYS THAT WE CAN ADDRESS AND THAT HAS BEEN OUR POSITION IN THE SENATE. SOME OF THE PROBLEMS IS THIS WAS THIS IDEA. WAS TO CORRECT. AND GENERAL FUND IS ONE SOURCE. AN OVERFLOW AND PROP TWO IS ANOTHER. AND I THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE BETTER RELY ON. AND. DOING SUCH THINGS IS S. THAT MAJOR POLICY AGAIN. MUST. POINT OUT MAJOR POLICY. AND TRAILER BILLS. THIS WOULD REQUIRE EXTENSIVE. POLICY COMMITTEE HEARINGS IN BOTH HOUSES. THAT GETS THE SHORT SHRIFT. LET'S LEAVE THIS ONE BE YES WE WILL CONTINUE THE DISCUSSIONS. BUT TO THE DEGREE THAT I'M PRIVY AND APPOINT PART OF ANY DISCUSSIONS. REVISITING THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL WILL NOT BE WHERE I'D LIKE TO SEE US GO. ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM. SO THIS IS A. OFF THE AT THE THE WATER ISSUE IS A. EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND IT'S ONE THAT'S BEEN. HAUNTING US REALLY I THINK FOR A FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW. AND THE BONDING BILL HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A COUPLE YEARS. AT SOMETHING THAT I SUPPORT. A AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS SO OF SUGGESTING WILL BE SOME CONVERSATIONS AND. THERE ARE SOME TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO HELP SUPPORT A SOLUTION. BUT IS THAT THE ONLY OPTION THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS CONSIDERING UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS A. PRIORITY I THINK CA FOR THE ADMINISTRATION THE SENATE AND. OF THE ASSEMBLY. SO WHAT I WOULD SAY IS. ASMUS COSTA NOTED ABOUT THE BASIC BUDGET ARCHITECTURE IS IS THAT. WERE. LIMITING. ONGOING GENERAL FUND COMMITMENTS AND THE. MISSING LINK RIGHT NOW WITH US IN TERMS OF SAFE DRINKING WATER IS THE ONGOING OPERATION MAINTENANCE COSTS FOR THESE. SMALL DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE A LARGE ENOUGH RATE BASE TO SUPPORT THE. OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF THESE DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT FUNDING PROVIDED OFFER INFRASTRUCTURE. UP CAPITAL COSTS OFFERED DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS ARE IN VARIOUS RESOURCES BONDS BUT REALLY THAT KIND OF THE THE KEY ISSUE RIGHT NOW IS THE ON GOING ON AND THAT'S ONGOING. IN SO WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING. A ONGOING FUNDING SOURCE. FROM. A. CERTAIN. PORTFOLIO OF FEES TO SUPPORT THIS OF THIS CRITICAL ISSUE. THANK YOU. SO IN THE ARAB WORLD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF THAT ALSO LIKE TO SPEAK ON THE AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER PROPOSAL AND I WANT TO. BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT WE ALL AGREE ON BECAUSE I KNOW THE SENATE IN THE ASSEMBLY REJECTED THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL BUT I THINK WE ALL ARE UNANIMOUS IN OUR OPINION. THAT ACCESS TO CLEAN AND SAFE DRINKING WATER SOMETHING THAT WE WANT ALL CALIFORNIANS TO HAVE. BUT IT'S JUST HOW WE GET THERE THAT WE ARE DISAGREEING ON HOW DO WE PAY FOR IT AND. I THINK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT IN AN ERA WHEN. WE HAVE A ABOUT A NINE BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET SURPLUS TO BE TALKING ABOUT ADDITIONAL TAXES THAT ARE ACROSS WORKING FAMILIES MONEY. I AM IN PARTICULAR. THE TAXES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED ARE. ONEROUS AND REGRESSIVE BECAUSE THEY DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT THE SEGMENT OF OUR POPULATION THAT CAN LEAST AFFORD IT. ARE AMONGST THE. THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSALS IS A WATER CONNECTION TAX WOULD OUT ABOUT A DOLLAR. PER WATER CONNECTION TO EVERYONE A BILL IN MONTHLY IN CALIFORNIA. AND OF THAT. IS IS SOMETHING THAT MY CONSTITUENTS ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WHEN THEY ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR BILLS. AND IF YOU LOOK AT YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN CALIFORNIA QUITE OFTEN THIS IS OUR SOLUTION. TO SOLVING PROBLEMS WE SEGMENT OUT THE PROBLEM WE TRY AND. WORK ORCHESTRATE ATTACKS THAT SOLVES THAT PROBLEM BUT INADVERTENTLY WHAT WE DO IS WE CONTRIBUTE TO THE RISE OF THE COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE INCREASE THE DISPARITY BETWEEN. WHAT ACOSTA LIVING CALIFORNIA WHAT ACOSTA LIVE IN OTHER STATES? AND A THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT'S BEEN A REAL PROBLEM THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE U. S. CENSUS BUREAU'S. POVERTY INDEX WHICH INCLUDES THE SUPPLEMENTAL POVERTY INDEX INCLUDES THE COST OF LIVING. AND I'LL YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE WORST POVERTY OF ANY STATE THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS IS THAT DISPARITY IN LIVING COSTS SO THAT THAT'S. I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT FEEL FREE WITH OUR DISCUSSION HERE WITH BUT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT WHETHER NOT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT THEY SHOULD. WE TALK ABOUT HOW TO PAY FOR IT AND I WOULD HOPE THAT. FOR SOMETHING THAT WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE IS A FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND ROOM FOR THAT IN OTHER PLACES IN THE BUDGET. THIS IS OUR JOB ON THIS COMMITTEE IS TO PRIORITIZE STATE GOVERNMENT SPENDING AND I THINK THAT. AFFORD TO CLEAN AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER SHOULD BE HIGH UP ON THE LIST HIGH ENOUGH UP ON THE LIST THAT WE DON'T NEED TO PROVIDE PROOF TO OUR. PROPOSE ANOTHER TAX TO PAY FOR IT. THANK YOU SARAH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ALTERNATIVE. PROLONGED AS. BUT I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS MEANS MY UNDERSTANDING WE HAVE. SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED TO A THOUSAND OF THESE SMALL WATER AGENCIES IN THE STATE THAT. HAVE FEWER THAN ONE HUNDRED CUSTOMERS. I'M HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME GETTING MY ARMS AROUND EXACTLY WHAT THIS. PROPOSAL IS GOING TO DO I HEAR OWING HIM. IT'S NOT FOR CONSTRUCTION IT'S NOT FOR DIGGING NEW WELLS IT'S NOT FOR REPLACING. DETERIORATING PLATE. IS THAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHO'S GOT THE STICK HERE. SO REGULATORY FINE AS AS EARLIER DEPARTMENT DOES HAVE FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE BUT. THE REMAINING PIECE THAT MANY COMMITTEES. DON'T QUALIFY PREFERRED DOCTOR FUNDING BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE. SUPPORT FOR OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE AND SO NOW THIS PROPOSAL IS PRIMARILY TO HAVE THE FUNDS GO FOR OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE. THAT WILL THEN FACILITATE THE COMMUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO QUALIFY FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING SO UGLY THEY ARE ABLE TO GET THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAN TO MAINTAIN AND OPERATE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. WELL FOR EXAMPLE MEAN. WHO WHO'S COLLECTING THIS MONEY AS IT WERE DOING THIS ON A STATEWIDE BASIS IS AT THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD? SO. CD OF THE. HAD THE BAR FOOD AND AGRICULTURE COLLECTING THE THROUGH THE AGRICULTURE XP YOUTH AND THEN THE WATER HAD ENTITIES WATER AGENCIES WILL BE COLLECTING THE THIEVES ON THE RATE PAYERS WHICH WILL THEN I GO TO THE STATE. TO THE STATE WHO IN THE STATE. IT BE THAT THE WATER BOARD WOULD BE THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE PROGRAM A ONE RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD YES. OKAY SO THEN HOW DOES THE MONEY GET DISTRIBUTED BACK DOWN TO THE WATER DISTRICT. SO THAT WOULD BE THROUGH EITHER DIFFERENT GRANT OR LOAN PROGRAMS THAT THE WATER BOARD READ MISTER TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE. COMMUNITY THEY NEED ONE OF THEM LISTEN LIKE I I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN TRYING TO FIX WATER PROBLEMS AS SOME OF YOU KNOW FOR SMALL DISTRICTS DOWN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS VERY DIFFICULT ISSUE. SELECT COMMANDMENT RATIONS FOR THIS EFFORT. BUT. IF YOU HAVE A WATER DISTRICT WAS SEVENTY FIVE CUSTOMERS HOW LIKELY IS IT THAT THE WATER DISTRICTS GOING TO BE ABLE TO SUBMIT UP TO DRAFT AND SUBMIT AN APPROPRIATE GRANT TO GET MONEY. HOW LIKELY IS IT THAT A WATER DISTRICT IS GONNA KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THE MONEY? ONCE THEY GET THE MONEY. IF THERE PLATE. REPLACEMENTS IN REPAIRS THAT NEED TO BE DONE HOW LIKELY IS THAT THE SMALL WATER DISTRICTS CAN HAVE A QUALIFIED WATER ENGINEER. OR INAPPROPRIATE. CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER. OR TECHNICIAN THAT'S GOING AND KNOW HOW TO MANAGE THE MONEY IF A CONSTRUCTION PROJECT IS OF MAINTENANCE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT IS REQUIRED HOW LIKELY IS IT A SMALL DISTRICT WAS SEVENTY FIVE CUSTOMERS IS GOING TO KNOW HOW TO. AT THE HEAD OF PLAN DESIGN MANAGED TO CONSTRUCTION REPAIR. I I AND AGAIN. I GUESS THAT'S MORE COMMON AND LET'S NOT A FAIR QUESTION. BUT YOU CAN SEE MY CONCERN AND INSTEAD OF DESIGNING THIS. BONTA REGIONALIZED BASIS WHERE YOU ENCOURAGE IF NOT REQUIRE. DR. COLLABORATION AND COOPERATION BETWEEN REGIONAL WATER AGENCIES TO TRY TO FIX PROBLEMS. IN SMALL WATER DISTRICTS WITHIN A REGION. INSTEAD OF DESIGNING IT IN THAT WAY WHERE PEOPLE WHOSE WATER BILLS ARE GOING TO GO UP A DOLLAR A MONTH. UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS REALLY NOT ABOUT GIVING A BUNCH OF MONEY TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND MORE ABOUT MUTUAL AID IN PART. IN IN HELPING YOUR NEIGHBOR GET CLEAN DRINKING WATER. WE HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT TIME SELLING THIS TO PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE IN INLAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE JUST HAD THEIR WATER RATES INCREASE FIVE PERCENT PER YEAR FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. AND THEY'RE GONNA SEND THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS TO WEAR. EUREKA NOTHING AGAINST EUREKA BUT. BYE DOT THE PEOPLE KNOW WHERE THAT IS. SO I GUESS WHAT I AM SAYING IN MY COMMENT AND THEN I'M GOING TO SHUT UP SO MY CHAIR CAN MOVE THIS ALONG. WE NEED TO GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARDS HERE BECAUSE I THINK WE'VE SEEN IN OUR ON OTHER ISSUES IN OTHER TIMES. THAT. CALIFORNIANS ARE NOT REALLY INTERESTED IN TAKING MONEY OUT OF THEIR POCKET AND SENDING IT TO THE STATE TO BE SENT SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY DON'T KNOW. AND AND I I JUST DON'T THINK THIS IS. YOU KNOW THAT IN FAIRNESS TO MY COLLEAGUE WHO'S THIS IS BETTER CRUSADE FOR HIM I'LL DO WHAT I CAN IF IT COMES FROM FORCED TO MOVE IT OUT OF THIS BUDGET. CONFERENCE COMMITTEE BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. IF IT GETS TO THE FLOOR. MY POSITION ON IT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT BECAUSE I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S BEEN. DESIGNED PROPERLY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR. SEVERAL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. IN THIS PROPOSAL WE'RE LOOKING AT FOR NEW TAXES. I'M SEEING WATER CONNECTION FERTILIZER MILKEN CONFINED ANIMAL IS THAT. CORRECT. COULD YOU EXPLAIN HOW THEY WORK. I GOT WATER CONNECTION THAT'S FOR EVERYBODY IN THE STATE. YEAH SO FOR THAT DRINKING WATER BE. THERE BE. FOR DIFFERENT LEAVES THAT DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF A WATER METER AND SO MOST. HEALTH TOLD WOULD PAY NINETY FIVE CENTS HOW THAT FOR ONE INCH WATER METER AND THEN THAT GOES UP TO. TEN DOLLARS PER MONTH FOR. METERS OF. FOUR INCHES OR GREATER BUT OVER NINETY PERCENT HOUSEHOLD TO PAY TO NINETY FIVE AND COULD BE FALL WITHIN THE SMALLER WATER METER. AFTER THE COMBINED AND FEVE ASIDE FOR A THOUSAND DOLLAR FOR THROUGH PER FACILITY FEE. THE VERY FEE ITSELF POINT NO ONE THREE FIVE FIVE. COST PER HUNDRED POUNDS OF MILK. THE FOR LIKE THEIR FEE IF POINT THOUGH THINK DOLLAR PER SALE AS WE GIVE YOU A CHART THAT BREAKS OUT THE DIFFERENT FEES. BUT ENOUGH IN SUPPORT OF THE AGRICULTURE FEES THEY ARE INTENDED TO MITIGATE THE NITRATE CAUSE RELATED TO THE CABIN CONTAMINATION OF THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY. CLEAR WHAT THE A REPORT CONDUCTED BY A CONTRACTOR. THAT WOULD RETAIN BY THE CALIFORNIA WATER FOUNDATION I DID IDENTIFY THE COST PER TYPICALLY RELATED TO NITRATES FROM THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY HAS SO THE THIEVES ARE. INTENDED TO MAO TO THAT BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY OF CONTRIBUTING TO NITRATE CONTAMINATION. OUR RATES I THINK YOU'VE GIVEN ME SOME MATERIAL. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. SO NIELSEN. YEAH JUST TO CLARIFY THAT THE. I BELIEVE THE TRAILER BILL PROPOSES VERY SIMILAR TO SENATOR MODDING SCALE WHICH. HAS ALREADY GONE THROUGH. THE SENATE SAYS YOU MIGHT HAVE FAMILIAR WITH THAT IN THAT FOR. SO I APOLOGIZE NO NOT. I SORRY I APOLOGIZE BUT THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION. SENATE OF. WELL. THERE WAS A HEARING. IN IN THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE AND RESOURCE. COMPRISED THAT FOR MEMBERS. OF THE ENTIRE LEGISLATURE. THAT HEARD THIS. NORMA SHIRLEY SIGNIFICANT ISSUE. AND KEEP IN MIND. THERE'S NO PROVISION HERE FOUR LET'S JUST SAY IT THE NITRATE ISSUE. AT SOME POINT THAT WILL BE REMEDY AT SOME LEVEL. AT THAT POINT THEY'RE SHOULD BE A PROVISION IN HERE THAT THE TAX SOUP. GOES WAIT. AT SUNSET. ELIMINATE. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE DO IN CALIFORNIA BUDGET WE PUT. BUDGET PROVISIONS THEN AND IN THIS CASE KIND OF IN THE DARK TONIGHT WAY. TAXES ARE FOREVER. AND THE BOARD WOULD HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO RAISE THOSE TAXES. THE LEGISLATURE HAS GIVEN MANY BOARDS THE AUTHORITY DERANGED. FEES IF YOU WANT A COLUMN THAT. ON THEIR OWN VOLITION. WITHOUT ANY CONTROL OF THE LEGISLATURE AND AS WELL BROADEN THE APPLICATION. OF THOSE THREE SLASH TAXES. THIS IS A REALLY BIG GAME GOING ON. WHEN I TALKED ABOUT THE TRAILER BILLS FEW WEEKS AGO I SAID LET THE GAMES BEGIN. THIS IS WHAT WE'RE DOING LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OUT THERE IN THE. PUBLIC. THE GAMES ARE BEGINNING. JUST FOR CLARITY. THERE CAN BE. DEBATE OVER WHETHER IT SHOULD BE A POLICY BILL OR. BUDGET TRAILER BILL BUT. THERE'S NO DARK OF NIGHT UP PROCESS WITH THIS. THAT THE TRAILER BILL WAS POSTED BACK IN FEBRUARY IT'S BEEN AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC FOR MONTHS NOW AND. THE ADMINISTRATION'S BEEN TRANSPARENT ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL. SINCE JANUARY. THANK YOU. SO WITHOUT SEEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS WE'RE GOING TO BE GOING TO ISSUE THREE THE CAP AND TRADE. EXPENDITURE PLAN DIFFERENT. CASS ELLIOT NOT TO GO LINE BY LINE EVERYBODY CAN LOOK AT THEIR. BRIEFS IF YOU HAVE ANY. OVERRIDING COMMENTS FEEL FREE BUT IF YOU KEEP IT RIGHT PUT APPRECIATE. SURE HOW'D ROSS BROWN WHAT THE LA OWE SO. AS THE CHAIR SAID I WILL NOW GO THROUGH LINE BY LINE YOU HAVE THE TABLE IN YOUR GENDER OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES. THINK WHAT I WOULD PROBABLY JUST WANNA HIGHLIGHT IS IS THE TOTAL NUMBERS DOWN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE TABLE. GOVERNOR PROPOSED ONE POINT THREE BILLION. THE ASSEMBLY OF RUN A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION MORE AND THE SENATE. ABOUT HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION MORE AND I THINK OUR GENERAL COMMENT AS WE WOULD RECOMMEND AN AMOUNT CLOSER TO WHAT THE SENATE. ADOPTED JUST GIVEN THE REVENUE UNCERTAINTY AROUND THIS PROGRAM JUST FOR CONTEXT IF REVENUE IN THE BUDGET YEAR IS. TWO POINT NINE BILLION WHICH IS WHAT IT WAS OF THIS CURRENT YEAR IN WHAT. WE THINK IS REASONABLE FOR THE BUDGET YEAR. UNDER THE SENATE AMOUNT THAT WOULD LEAVE ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OR SO AS THE FUND BALANCE AND SO WE THINK GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY THAT'S A REASONABLE APPROACH ONE OTHER THING ON THE UNCERTAINTY. OF THE ADMINISTRATION AS PART OF TO IT PART OF PARTY TO ADDRESS THE UNCERTAINTY IS PROPOSING BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT WE GIVE FINANCING AUTHORITY TO. REDUCE THE ALLOCATIONS OF REVENUE CAME IN LOWER AS PART OF THAT PROPOSAL THEY PRIORITIZE SOME CERTAIN PROGRAMS. FOR EXAMPLE SOME PROGRAMS THAT THEY ARE RESOURCES BOARD WHICH WOULD NOT RECEIVE THOSE PROPORTIONAL REDUCTION SO AS YOU CONSIDER YOUR PRIORITIES YOU'LL WILL. WE RECOMMEND YOU CONSIDER AND WHICH OF THOSE PROGRAMS WOULD LIKE. TO REDUCE IF IF IN FACT REVENUE DOES COME IN LOWER GREAT THANK YOU WAS COST. THANK YOU I KNOW THIS ITEM AND THE NEXT ISSUE ARE CONFORMING SO THERE'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF OVERLAP BETWEEN THIS AFTER OPPOSE ON CAP AND TRADE BASED ON THE FUNDING SOURCES. MUCH TO THE ANALYSTS POINT I THINK THE ONLY ALL RACIST A COUPLE OF CONCERNS WHICH IS I THINK WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE OVERLY OPTIMISTIC REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS THAT EACH HOUSE ADOPTED AS PART OF THEIR CAP AND TRADE PACKAGE. THERE'S A BIT OF A TIMING ISSUE WHICH IS THAT. THE MOST RECENT AUCTION HAPPENED AFTER WE RELEASED OUR MAY REVISE. BUT IT'S A DE MINIMUS AMOUNT IN THE CONTEXT OF CAP AND TRADE I'M AND SO CLEARLY THAT WAS NOT INCLUDED ARE IN ARE PLANNED BUT HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN EACH HOUSES PLAN. AS THE ANALYST NOTES. WE DO HAVE A CONTROL SECTION IN THE CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN GIVEN THE VOLATILITY OF THESE PARTICULAR REVENUES AND THE AUCTIONS THEMSELVES. HOWEVER WE DON'T VIEW THAT AS A BACKSTOP TO BUILD AND OVERLY OPTIMISTIC REVENUE. AND THE PROGRAMS ULTIMATELY DON'T EVER GET FUNDED IT'S REALLY MORE I'VE. THE ABILITY TO KIND OF I JUST WHEN THERE ARE MILD SWINGS AND WHAT WE'VE PROJECTED AS FAR AS THE AUCTION REVENUES. AND I'M GONNA PREVIEW A LITTLE BUT THE NEXT ISSUE WE DO SUPPORT FULL FUNDING OF THE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INITIATIVE TO ACCELERATE THAT SALE OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES THROUGH REBATES AND INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS. TO MEET THE GOVERNOR'S GOAL OF FIVE MILLION ZAPS BY TWENTY THIRTY. LASTLY I DO WANNA KNOW ON THE SENATE PROPOSAL AND THEIR VERSION THEY INCLUDE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE TO MAKE ONE HUNDRED MILLION OF THE FORCED HEALTH PROGRAM. AVAILABLE TO THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD AND STATE CONSERVANCY'S TO EMPLOYMENT CLIMATE RESILIENCY PROJECTS WE JUST KNOW AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT FREQUENTLY HAD THE DIRE SHAPE OF THE STATE'S FORESTS GIVEN THAT MANY FORCE FIRES THAT WE'VE HAD IN WILD FIRES. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE STATE EXPERIENCE TWO THOUSAND MORE WILDFIRES AND SAW ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PERCENT MORE ACRES BURNED THAN THE FIVE YEAR AVERAGE. NOTWITHSTANDING THE MERITS OF THE FIGHT WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD AND OTHER STEEP CONSERVANCY'S. THESE DEPARTMENTS FUNDAMENTALLY SERVER DIFFERENT PURPOSE AND WE'D LIKE TO SEE THE FORCE MONEY WITH CAL FIRE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE FOREST HEALTH ISSUES THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED. WITH THAT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SAYS MISS COSTA TOUCH SOMEONE WOULD TAKE ISSUE FOR AS WELL DO YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT AREA. WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO WALK THROUGH THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE PROPOSAL'S MISTER. TRUTHFULLY OKAY. SO. ULTRA WALKER THEN THERE'S A FEW DIFFERENT PIECES. JUST FOR CONTACTS THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED EIGHT ZERO MISSION. EXCUSE ME ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER EARLIER THIS YEAR I DO NOT FIND A GOAL OF FIVE MILLION ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES ON THE ROAD BY TWENTY THIRTY. AS WELL AS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND. CHARGING STATIONS ON THE ROAD BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TO SUPPORT THAT GOAL IS PART OF THE BUDGET THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED. ONGOING FUNDING A HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVENTY FIVE MILLION FOR THE REBATE PROGRAM ELECTRIC VEHICLE REBATE PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. AS WELL AS FUNDING FOR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH WAS COMPOSED OF TWO PIECES. INCLUDING AND INCLUDES A SEVENTY MILLION ONE TIME SPECIAL FUND FUND BALANCES. AS WELL AS RESTRUCTURING THE A ARE FTTP PROGRAM WHICH IS CURRENTLY ADMINISTERED BY THE ENERGY COMMISSION. FUNDS A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES INTENDED TO REDUCE EMISSIONS AND SO THE PROPOSAL WOULD ESSENTIALLY SHIFTS. OF THE FUNDING. TO FOCUS ALMOST EXPLICIT ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE. AND. THE PROPOSAL ALSO SHIFTED OF THE FUNDING THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY GOING TO LOW CARBON FUEL PRODUCTION TO THE. CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN. SO THE SENATE. PROVIDED A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FOR REBATES INSTEAD OF THE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION THAT THE GOVERNOR WAS PROPOSING. AND REJECTED THE INFRASTRUCTURE PART OF THE PROPOSAL WAS JUST THE PURPOSE OF SENDING IT TO CONFERENCE. THE ASSEMBLY ADOPTED THE PROPOSED AMOUNT FOR THE REBATE THAT THAT ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED AND A SLIGHTLY MODIFIED INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSAL TO KEEP THE FUNDING FOR LOW CARBON FUEL PRODUCTION. KEEP TWELVE POINT FIVE MILLION OF THAT IN THE A ARE SCTP PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE ENERGY COMMISSION RATHER THAN SHIFTING THAT. TO THE CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN. AND ADOPTED A VARIETY OF PIECES OF A PLACEHOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE INCLUDING CODIFYING THE FIVE MILLIONS OF GOAL PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR. AND. REMOVING A PROHIBITION ON CARP FROM ADOPTING REGULATIONS THAT REQUIRE THE BUILDING OF HYDROGEN STATIONS. AS MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED EARLIER THIS PROPOSAL JUST RAISES A VARIETY OF JUST SIGNIFICANT POLICY QUESTIONS THE LEGISLATURE AND THE COMMITTEE MIGHT WANT TO WRESTLE WITH THE LOCAL NEED TO WRESTLE WITH. INCLUDING HOW MUCH TO FOCUS ON A PARTICULAR TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY IN ITS EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE ITS GREENHOUSE GAS GOALS FOR EXAMPLE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. RATHER THAN. THAN RELYING ON SOME OF THE OTHER POLICIES THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS ALREADY ENACTED SUCH AS CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. AS WELL AS ON THE FUNDING SIDE HOW DO ALLOCATE ITS FUNDING AND WHETHER TO ALLOCATED TO A VARIETY OF OF. A DIFFERENT TYPES OF TECHNOLOGIES AS IS CURRENTLY DONE THROUGH THEY ARE FTTP PROGRAM OR FOCUS MORE EXCLUSIVELY ON ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE. SO WITHOUT ALL IN MY COMMENTS AND HAVE BEEN ANSWERING QUESTIONS. GREAT ETCETERA. I JUST WANNA THERE'S NO LANGUAGE NO I'M SORRY MA'AM. LET'S HAVE SOMEONE WHO KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT THIS SPEAK. I I JUST WANTED TO RESPOND TO THE CHAIR TO THE LA US COMMENTS ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE FIVE NAY. SO ONE COMPONENT I AS I MENTIONED IT WILL BE INTERTWINED WITH THE CAP AND TRADE PROPOSAL BECAUSE ONE OF THE FUNDING SOURCES WE UTILIZE AND TO FIND. COMPONENT PIECES OF THIS PROPOSAL. I WOULD NOTE THAT WE SUPPORT FULLY FUNDING AND THIS APP INITIATIVE INCLUDING THE ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS WE'VE PROPOSED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE. FREQUENTLY IN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS RANGE ANXIETY COMES UP WHERE PEOPLE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE RANGE OF THEIR ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND BY HAVING ROBUST INFRASTRUCTURE WE CAN ADDRESS THAT. WE THINK ULTIMATELY HELP REACH OUR OF THE GOVERNOR'S GOAL OF HAVING MORE THAT'S ON THE RED BY TWENTY THIRTY. WE ALSO PROPOSE EIGHT HUNDRED TWELVE MILLION IN FUNDING FROM THE ALTERNATIVE AND RENEWABLE FUEL AND VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY FUND OVER THE NEXT YEARS TO FIND INSTALLATION OF TWO HUNDRED HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS. AND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND THAT HAVE CHARGERS INCLUDING TEN THOUSAND DIRECT CURRENT FAST CHARGERS BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TO ME ARE LARGER ZEV GOAL. AND SO WE WOULD JUST EMPHASIZE AS WE CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION THE IMPORTANCE OF INFRASTRUCTURE PAIRED WITH REBATES WITH THAT HAPPENING ANSWERING QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SENATOR OFF. I WAS CHARGED FOR MAKE SURE WE'RE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT TODAY AND WHAT WE'RE CONSIDERING. POSTAL DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY FOR TREATMENT LANGUAGE IS THAT CORRECT. THAT IS CORRECT THAT'S NOT PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE. SO THE THE BEST THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL INCLUDES. I CODIFYING THE NEW GOAL OF FIVE MILLION ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES BY TWENTY THIRTY. WHAT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? TO CODIFY IT. IT MEANS THAT IT'S INCLUDED IN STATUTE. IT'S IN THEM APPROPRIATE TAKES ACTUALLY GOT THAT WHAT WHAT IS A DO. BUT WHAT IS THE EFFECTIVE PUTTING IT IN STATUTE. I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THE. ADMINISTRATION HAD AN EXECUTIVE ORDER ANY. AND WHAT. I THINK A ASSEMBLY ACTION DOES IS IT. IT IT'S THE OTHER BRANCH ANOTHER BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. MEMORIALIZING THEIR. COMMITMENT TO THE SINGLE THAT WAS PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S EXECUTIVE ORDER. OKAY. I GOT I GOT I UNDERSTAND THAT MEANS THE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. SO MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR. ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE REBATES I UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT DOES YOU KNOW CODIFYING A GOAL IS BECAUSE GOT MORE NEBULOUS AND AND REALLY WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE MERITS OF IT. BUT IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE A PRETTY WEIGHTY POLICY DISCUSSION I REALLY DON'T THINK IT HAS A PLACE IN THE BUDGET I'D RATHER TALK ABOUT THE DOLLARS AND SENSE OF WHERE MONEY GOES. SO SINCE IT'S OUR TRUE GODDESS I LITTLE CLARITY SO. DOT IDEAS GIVEN HOW MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WHERE INVESTING I THINK THE QUESTION IS IS WHAT IS THE ULTIMATE END GOAL AT SOME POINT IS THERE IS IS THERE AN END TO THAT SO I THINK THE GOAL WAS? TO. APPROPRIATE. THE UNDERSERVED A FIVE BUT WITH VERY SET GOAL OF. HITTING THAT FIVE MILLION VEHICLE GOAL BY TWENTY THIRTY SO THAT I THINK THAT'S AWESOME. FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A GOLD OKAY WELL BUT IT'S THAT I KINDA MISS SITTING ON SUB THREE BECAUSE I USED TO BE PART OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS. YOU'RE WELCOME BACK INTO THE. AND COULD NOT I DON'T TO SPEAK FOR MISTER BLUE NOW WE WE MISS STROLLER LEVEL TO TO FEATHER SKINNER NOT THAT WE DON'T LOVE OUR CURRENT. STORY COUPLE QUESTIONS. DISCUSSED WHEN YOU WERE DESCRIBING. SOME OF THE FUNDS YOU ARE REFERENCING WORD ARE NOT CAP AND TRADE FUNDS CORRECT SO THEY INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDS ARE GENERAL FUND IS THAT RIGHT FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING OR THEY FROM A DIFFERENT SOURCE. IF THE ALTERNATIVE AND RENEWABLE FUEL AND VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY FUND SO THAT'S FROM. YOU KNOW WHAT THE. THE SHORT HAND IT WOULD BE AB ONE EIGHTEEN. ANYWAY. THERE'S NEVER. BUT THAT'S NOT IN THE LIST OF. AYE ALLOCATIONS THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH BECAUSE IT'S NOT CAP AND TRADE FUNDS. SO IT'S NOT PARTY GREENHOUSE GAS. REDUCTION FOR YEAH I LIVE THE REASON WHY WERE. SO ME. CLARIFY THE THE THE. CONNECTING THE DOTS OF SO SO TO SPEAK SO THE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INITIATIVE THERE'S KIND OF TWO BUCKETS TO IT. THERE'S THE REBATES WHICH ARE INCENTIVES TO CONSUMERS TO PURCHASE A VEHICLE THEN THERE'S INFRASTRUCTURE. THE REBATE. PORTION OF HIS HAVE INITIATIVE IS FUNDED OUT A CAP AND TRADE THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED TO HUNDRED MILLION TOTAL FOR THAT. COMBINED WITH EIGHT INFRASTRUCTURE. YEP SO ONE SEVENTY FIVE YEAH SO. THE CLARIFICATION THERE IS A ONE SEVENTY FIVE IS FOR THE CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROJECT IN WITHIN. THERE'S A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR SOME. LOW INCOME. THOUGHT EQUITY PROGRAMS WITHIN THAT HUNDRED MILLION THERE'S TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR ADDITIONAL REBATES TO LOW INCOME CONSUMERS. SO IT'S LIKE A SUBSET OF THE HUNDRED. IN MEN YOU HAVE. AB ONE EIGHTEEN FUNDS. ORIGINS. YEAH A IT'S WITHIN THE ENHANCE FLEET MODERNIZATION SO WITHIN THE HUNDRED MILLION THERE THIS TWENTY FIVE THE GOES FOR ADDITIONAL REBATES. FOR LOW OF FOR LOW INCOME. THAT'S THE. FIFTH ITEM DOWN YEAH. TWENTY FIVE MILLION OF THAT. GOES TO BRP. CORRECT. ALRIGHT AND. THE. THE. A. R. F.. BE PROGRAM YOUR REFERENCE ANOTHER EXPENDITURE ON THAT BUT AGAIN THAT'S NOT FROM THE CARBON. GIGI FIND IT'S FROM THE ONE EIGHTEEN FUND CROOKED. FINALLY ON THE ISSUE OF A STATUTE PHONE EXECUTIVE ORDERS ARE GREAT BUT THE. ONLY CURIOUS FAR AS A GOVERNOR CARRIES AND. PUTTING IT INTO IT PUTTING THE GOING TO STATUTES. I THINK THE BENEFIT OF IT ESPECIALLY WHEN WE ARE. CONSIDERING WHEN WE HAVE ALREADY. MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN THIS AREA. AND WE CONTINUE TO. IN TERMS OF AS ALL THREE THE ADMINISTRATION THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY ARE ALL RECOMMENDING A PRETTY HIGH NUMBER IN HERE WHAT WE. JOHN WE'LL SEE. BUT I THINK THE BENEFIT OF HAVING THE GOLAN STATUTE IS THEN AT LEAST WERE DIRECTING. WHEN WE AUTHORIZE FUNDING. IT GIVES THE AGENCIES WERE ADMINISTERING IT MORE DIRECTION AS TO OUR EIGHT WHAT IS THE GOAL THAT WERE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH WITH THIS FUNDING THAT WE HAVE AUTHORIZED. AND THEN THEY CAN DESIGN THE PROGRAM TO HELP US MOST. THAT GOAL SO I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY WISE BECAUSE APPROVING. IT'S GREAT TO. APPROVED BUDGETARY FUNDS BUT MANY TIMES IF WE TAKE OUR PROP NINETY EIGHT EXPENDITURES FOR EXAMPLE THEIR STATUTE ALREADY THAT EXISTS THAT IS. GUIDING THE EXPENDITURE OF THAT MONEY AND THE BENEFIT OF ADDING. THE. THAT GOAL IS THAT IT WILL ONCE AGAIN GUY THE EXPENDITURE OF THE MONEY SO I WOULD SUPPORT IT. THANK YOU CENTER MORLOCK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. WE'RE WE'RE SPENDING. OR BUDGETING A LOT OF MONEY FOR THE END. USAGE A EIGHT HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION FOR RECHARGING STATIONS. SALAS ELECTRICITY HAS TO GO SOMEWHERE HAS TO COME FROM SOMEWHERE HAS TO BE. TRANSPORTED IN. AND I THINK YOU ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY TWO. HAS A BLIND SPOT IN THAT IT DOESN'T ACCOUNT FOR THE GREENHOUSE GASES. THAT ARE CREATED BY ALL THESE WILDFIRES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT I'D I DON'T SEE A STRONG ENOUGH EMPHASIS IN TRYING TO. HARDEN THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR OUR ELECTRICITY TRANSPORTATION WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT TRANSPORTING COAL. GAS DIESEL. JET FUEL AB WOULD. WE KNOW WE HAVE TO LEARN SOMETHING FROM SANOMA AND SANTA ROSA. AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET A WINDY CONDITION AND. IT IS TAKES TWO AND A HALF DAYS OF WILDFIRES AND YOU'VE WIPED OUT ALL YOUR. GREENHOUSE GAS STATS. ALL THIS HARD WORK ALL THIS REDIRECTION ALL THIS EFFORT AND FOR NOT SO. I'D I'D LIKE TO SEE A LITTLE MORE. IN THE WAY OF FUNDING. TO HARDEN THE ASSETS NOT TAKE ALL THE SAID PENALIZE ALL THE UTILITY. RATEPAYERS. BUT WE SHOULD BE USING SOME OF THIS CAP AND TRADE. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PREVENT FIRES FROM OCCURRING. WITH THESE ELECTRICAL LINES SO THAT YOU CAN REDUCE YOUR GREENHOUSE GAS. AND TRANSPORT THE ELECTRICITY BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING AT TEST FOOT TRUCKS NOW IT TAKES THE SAME AMOUNT OF POWER. TO GENERATE A LOT AT THE TOYOTA LECTURE FIVE THREE THOUSAND HOMES JUST TO RECHARGE ONE TRUCK FOR LIKE THREE HUNDRED MILES SO. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY EIGHT UNEVEN STATISTICALLY NOVICA MOVE AT ALL. AT TO WHERE YOU WANT TO GET IT TO GO SO I I WOULD THINK. WE SHOULD BE REVAMPING THIS LIST. WE'RE ALLOCATING THE HUNDRED. AND SEE WHAT TWENTY FIVE MILLION TO FIRE. LOOK AT FIRE RESPONSE BUT WE SHOULD BE ALLOCATING PROBABLY. TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. AB ADOPT ONE POINT THREE BILLION FOR SERIOUS ABOUT GREENHOUSE GASES. SO I I JUST WANT TO THROW THAT IN RICHARD SURE. OBVIOUSLY NOT HERE FOR DEBATE CLUB BUT. I I THINK WE'RE WE'RE NOT. BEING SINCERE. IF WE'RE NOT FOCUSED ON TRYING TO PREVENT. S. FIRES. FOR MORE THE REALLY OCCURRING SO THANK YOU MUCH. JUST FOR CLARITY VEHEMENT INSTRUCTIONS PROPOSAL ACTUALLY INCLUDES. ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION TOTAL. FOR. VARIOUS FIRE UP PREVENTION ACTIVITIES THAT'S THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION THAT YOU HAD REFERENCED AS WELL AS OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION FOR VARIOUS. FIRE PREVENTION FORCE CARBON PLAN OF PROJECTS THE. THAT IDENTIFIES KIND OF. THE TREE MORTALITY CRISIS THAT'S GOING ON AND TRIES TO REDUCE THE WILD VIRUS ASSOCIATE WITH THAT. BUT THOSE ARE CONTROLLED BURNS. AND THAT'S NOT GETTING TO THE CRUX OF WHAT'S CAUSING. THE PROBLEM WITH STARTING THE FIRES. AND SO I THINK I THINK THE WHOLE THING SHOULD BE REEVALUATED. IF WAS SINCERE ABOUT REDUCING GREENHOUSE GASES. THE GODDESS ARE LOOKING AT HOW WE MOVE THIS ELECTRICITY AROUND STATE. THANK YOU SIMILAR PROBLEM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. BUT FOR THE ADMINISTRATION ON ISSUE THREE PAST UP. A I G. GRF PLANS HAVE INCLUDED FUNDING FOR. LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION STATE WATER EFFICIENCY AND AND ENHANCEMENT URBAN FORESTRY IN URBAN GREENING PROGRAMS WETLANDS COASTAL ADAPTATION. AND NATURAL LANDS ADAPTATION AND SAID. THEY. THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL ZEROS THOSE PROGRAMS NOW TO AS FAR AS DDR A FLOOD OF FUNDING AND I'M WONDERING TO. WHAT THE THINKING IS BEHIND THE? SO IN TERMS OF THE FUNDING IN TERMS OF THE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION THEIR SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF EXISTING FUNDS. THAT ARE. I HAVEN'T BEEN FULLY ALLOCATED IN SO. WE WANTED TO SEE THOSE FUNDS SPENT FIRST BEFORE WE ALLOCATED MORE IN TERMS OF THE VARIOUS NATURAL RESOURCES. RELATED. PROGRAMS THAT YOU IDENTIFIED. S. B. FIVE PROPS SIXTY EIGHT A INCLUDES ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THOSE AT HOME PARTICULAR PROGRAMS. AND. THE ADMINISTRATION DID PROPOSE AND AS PART OF THE BUDGET. ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THOSE PROGRAMS AS PART OF THE. SP FIVE ALLOCATION. WELL AGAIN I WOULD I'M PRETTY I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT IN THE CURRENT YEAR THE CAP AND TRADE PROPOSAL'S UPWARDS OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS WE WERE ABLE TO GET A LIFE SOME RESERVE FUNDS. I'M SO BVIOUSLY WERE ALSO WORKING OFTEN MUCH LOWER NUMBER OVER ON THE PACKAGE AND SO THERE ARE CERTAIN DECISIONS THAT WE HAD TO MAKE WITH AND THE EXPENDITURES AVAILABLE AND THE FUN THAT WE'RE PROJECTING BASED ON AUCTION REVENUES. CRITICS SO I I JUST WANNA SAY WHEN IT COMES TO SG FIVE AND AND PROP SIXTY EIGHT I THINK BECAUSE. OF THE INTENTION OF THOSE FUNDING SOURCES WAS TO SUPPLEMENT NOT SUPPLANT. OF THE G. HERE ARE A FUNDING. AND TO. I I THINK THIS THE WRONG DIRECTION AGO. OKAY THANK YOU. ANY OTHER. COMMENTS POSTCARDS SOME THE MEMBER CHAVEZ THANK YOU. YEAH LITTLE SHORT GUY IN THE BACK CORNER HERE. HAVE BEEN QUITE ALL THE HEY GUYS DONE. THE. LAST THURSDAY THE CPU CA IN THIS A FOR THE LA SHOW. VOTER TO INVEST EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE. FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE. HOW DOES THAT WORK WITH? THE A WHOLE PICTURE. OF EVERY STRUCTURE IN REBATE WITH VEHICLES. UNDERSTAND WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO THIS GOAL OF HAVE. MORE LAUGHTER VEHICLES BUT I WAS AT WORK OUT OF THE TO WORK TOGETHER. SO OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT A LARGE CHUNK OF THE. RESOURCES THAT WERE APPROVED BY TWO UC WOULD GO TOWARDS MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND SO THAT'S A ONE OF THE BIG FOCUS IS OF THAT. I I THINK THERE ARE. SOME QUESTIONS AROUND EXACTLY SORT OF HOW THE DIFFERENT PIECES LE WOULD BE COORDINATED THE DIFFERENT PIECES OF FUNDING FROM THE ENERGY COMMISSION PROGRAM THAT IS WAS A PIECE SEIZE PROGRAM. SAWS ARE SOME FUNDING. THROUGH THE VW SETTLEMENT THAT'S GOING TO THE OUR MISSION VEHICLE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE. OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE. ADMINISTRATION IS IS VIEWING IT AS THE. FUNDING THAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT HERE THAT WOULD BE ADMINISTERED BY THE ENERGY COMMISSION WOULD BE USED TO ESSENTIALLY FILL IN GAPS. FOR SORT OF CHARGING VEHICLE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ISN'T PROVIDED THROUGH SOME OF THOSE OTHER FUNDING SOURCES. AND SO THEY WOULD. USER A PROCESS TO TRY TO SORT OF IDENTIFY WHAT THOSE OTHER PROGRAMS ARE FUNDING AND USE THIS FUND INTO TO FILL THOSE GAPS. SO THE INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING PROGRAM THAT DOES THAT TAKE CPUC DELAWARE. WHAT WOULD YOU THINK WOULD BE THE LIFE CYCLE INVESTMENT IN THESE INFRASTRUCTURE? SO WE'RE GONNA BUY INTO THESE STATIONS. ARE THEY GONNA IN TWENTY YEARS THIRTY YEARS FIVE YEARS ARE WE GOING TO HAVE TO REINVEST. AND THEN HOPPED OUT. WHAT WHAT DO WE TRYING TO BUILD THEIR HOUSE GOING TO BE THERE? YOU KNOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER I'M NOT QUITE SURE KIND OF HOW THEY HAVE KIND OF. THE LIFESPAN OF THE PARTICULAR ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING. STATION IS. SOME OF THE FUNDING FOR THE C. C. GOES TO HYDROGEN FUELING INFRASTRUCTURES AND SO THOSE ARE. THOSE ARE SORT LARGER FACILITIES THAT I WOULD IMAGINE LAST. QUITE AWHILE AND NOT SURE IF THE ADMINISTRATION HAS A GREAT SENSE FIRST OR HOW LONG THE. THE STATIONS ARE SUPPOSED TO LAST. WHEN WE TOUCH ANOTHER ONE THEN. WE'RE WE'RE PUTTING MONEY INTO REBATES TO FOR PEOPLE TO GET THESE VEHICLES. THE INVESTMENT MAKING AND THESE VEHICLE WHAT'S A LIFE CYCLE OF A VEHICLE. AND I THINK YOU SEE WHERE I'M GOING RIGHT NOW. I. I MEAN I I THINK THE LIFE CYCLE OF THE VEHICLE COULD GO VERY BUT YEAH. FIFTEEN YEARS OR SO. IS AND. BUT I I'M NOT I'M NOT QUITE SURE AND I THINK IT DEPENDS ON THE ON THE DRIVER. I'M BADGES VEHICLES PROBABLY FIVE TO TEN YEARS SO WE WHAT I'M GETTING TO IS WHERE. I DON'T AND I'M ALL FORGET NOT CARBON OUT ENVIRONMENT YOU KNOW I'M THE GUY THAT SAID YEAH YOU KNOW CLIMATE CHANGE REAL THING WAS DEAL WITH IT. BUT WHAT I'M HAVING A PROBLEM WITH HIS UNDERSTANDING NOW COULD REMOVE A LOT OF MONEY FROM THE A CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. IF WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO THIS GOAL. WHO'S DRIVE AT NEW WHERE STEP PLANNED IS FOR GOING ON OKAY WE HAVE TO DO THE EVER STRUCTURE. WE HAVE WE WE HAVE TO HAVE THE PRODUCTION OF ENERGY IS GOING TO GO INTO DECEMBER STRUCTURE. AND NEVER HAVE THESE VEHICLES GOING TO GO IN THERE. AND I WOULD IMAGINE. A LOT IS CAP AND TRADE MONEY IS GOING TO GO AWAY BY TWENTY THIRTY RIGHT THEM CAP AND TRADE GOES WAY. SO YEAH THE CURRENT PROGRAM IS AUTHORIZES THREW TWENTY THIRTY NINE AND SO. INVESTMENTS WERE TAKEN FOR THE CAP AND TRADE SEEMS TO ME. WOULD BE SUCH AS GOING TO GO AWAY. IT'S SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO YOU READ ABOUT THE STORY SOME MONTHS. SOME YEARS AGO THE ABOUT SCHOOL DISTRICTS USE IN BOND FUNDS TO BUY COMPUTERS. IN THE BOND FUND WAS FOR TWENTY YEARS OR FIFTEEN YEARS THIRTY YEARS OF THE COMPUTER ONLY LAST A FEW YEARS. SO SCHOOL THIS YEAR FOR MAKING DECISIONS BY THINGS THAT A VERY LOT LOW LIFE CYCLE I THINK WE'RE DOING THE SAME THING WITH CAP AND TRADE. WE'RE TAKING THE MONEY AND WE INVEST IN SOMETHING FOR REBATES. THEY HAVE A SHORT WINDOW OF RETURN ON INVESTMENTS PROBABLY MORE LIKE SMARTER ME ON THIS BUT THAT'S KIND I'M LOOKING AT IT. AND I THINK IN THAT WE SHOULD PROBABLY USE THE MONEY MOREAN. WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE. WITH THE CV CPUC WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO AS I UNDERSTAND THEY'RE HIDDEN ALL THE INDUSTRY'S SDG PACKED EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD FACE HE'S GOING HIT ME THE RATE PAYER. TO PAY FOR THESE THINGS. SO. CAP AND TRADE IN SOME NATION. IS MONEY. WAS LIKE A BOMB IS GOING TO BE HERE WHO HAS A SHE HAS A WINDOW. IN THE BE BEST TO INVEST IN SOMETHING THAT OUT LIVES THAT WINDOW. THEN TAKING IT IN INVESTED IN SOMEBODY'S LOKAR. PROBABLY BY THEMSELVES. BECAUSE OUR NUMBERS SHOWN ONLY PEOPLE RIGHT THESE HAVE PRETTY GOOD INCOME ANYWAY. IT. DOES HAVE A VERY SPECIALIZED SITE. SO I THINK. I'M ALL FOR. ELECTRICAL CARS NEW ENERGY NEW TRANSPORTATION ALL FOUR BUT I THINK WE HAVE A VERY FINITE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE SHOULD USE IT. IN THE MOST PRODUCTIVE WAY WE CAN AND I WOULD SAY BE BETTER TO BE AN INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT AND SOMEBODY'S LITTLE CAR. IF I CAN MR CHEN I'D LIKE TO RESPOND TO A COUPLE COMMENTS ON THE TRAIN AND PACKAGE THERE'S A LOT THERE ON-AGAIN. THE FUNDING SOURCES ARE FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT SO YOU REFERENCE BOND FUNDS ON THE K. TWELVE SIDE AND I THINK PART OF THE POLICY ARGUMENT THERE IS IF YOU BUY. IF YOU BUY WITH BOND FUNDS. A PRODUCTS. YOUR PAIN DEBT SERVICE ON THAT FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS. THE FUNDS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE THERE IS NOT A DEBT SERVICE COMPONENT LA THAT DOESN'T SAY YOU KNOW THAT WE SHOULDN'T WANT THEM TO BE INVESTMENT THAT WILL HAVE A DURABLE LIFECYCLE. ON BUT IT'S SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT I THINK THE ARGUMENT ON BOND FUNDS IS THAT THE STATE IS PAYING THE DEBT SERVICE FOR THIRTY YEARS IF IT ONLY LASTS FIVE YEARS WERE STILL PAYING FOR SOMETHING THAT'S NO LONGER IN USE. AND SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN BOND FUNDS AND GREENHOUSE GAS FUNDS BECAUSE THEY'RE FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE STATE'S FINANCIAL. VIEWPOINT BUT THEY'RE NOT DIFFERENT FROM THE INDUSTRY'S AT A PAIN FOR THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE MANUFACTURERS OR THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRIES THAT ARE BUYING. THESE TRACTORS AND THINGS TO BE. WHAT'S WHY THEY WERE THE WHOLE CABIN TRAIT THING WAS GOING INTO WAS AFFECTED MANUFACTURES AND AGRICULTURE'S OR MAKING LONG TERM INVESTMENTS. AND DAVID RETOOLING THEIR EFFORT AND THEY HAD TO GO OUT AND TAKE LONG TO DO THIS STUFF. SO I'M JUST SAYING. THERE'S A TALE OF THAT THING AND I THINK WE SHOULD USE THE MONEY. AND THEY. AND A LARGER PERSPECTIVE THEN REBATES. WOULD YOU DISAGREE WITH THAT. THEN THE ONE. EDITION AND I'D LIKE TO MAKE IN TERMS OF THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN CAP TRADE AS WELL AS GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS IN TERMS OF DEBT SERVICES. THE POINT OF THE REBATES IS ALSO TO ACCELERATE THE. TO SERVE MARKET IN SO THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS IS WHAT WE ARE LOOKING LONG TERM. ABOUT THE STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS AND TWENTY FIFTY. IN ORDER TO GET TO OUR TWENTY FIFTY GOALS. WE NEED TO CHANGE THE. MAKEUP OF THE STATE A VEHICLE V. VEHICLES ARE BEING DRIVEN IN ORDER TO GET THERE WE NEED. TRANSFORMATION IN TERMS OF THE OF VEHICLES THAT ARE PURCHASED SO THE MORE THAT YOU CAN ACCELERATE THE PURCHASE OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES COMBINED WITH INFRASTRUCTURE. THEN. YOU DRIVE THE. IT BECOMES ARM A SELF SUSTAINING MARKET WHERE. IN A CERTAIN POINT OH ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES THE PRICE OF A ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES ARE COMPARABLE TO OF FOSSIL FUEL GENERATED. VEHICLES AND THEN WITHOUT ANY REBATES WITHOUT ANY SUBSIDIES ARE CONSUMERS WOULD BE WILLING TO PURCHASE THE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES ON THE ROUND. AND IT THEN ACCELERATES. THROUGH A A NORMAL FUNCTIONING MARKET. THE CONSUMER'S WILLINGNESS TO PURCHASE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES SO WHAT THIS DOES AGAIN IF THE REBATE AN INFRASTRUCTURE COMBINED IS EXCELLING IN THE MARKET. BUT I'D ALSO SAY THAT ARGUMENT WAS USED WITH SOLAR PANELS. AND. FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WHEN WE STARTED SOLAR PANELS WE SUBSIDIZE THAT SO THE SOLAR PANELS GO DOWN TO THE PEOPLE GO USE THEM. AND NOW'S A SOLAR PANELS HAVE GONE DOWN AS A MORE EFFICIENT. AND A MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE. BUT DISTILLATE DRIVE RIGHT NOW TO CONTINUE TO SUBSIDIZE PANELS AYE THEY COME TO MY OFFICE ALL TIMES AND WE NEED TO EVERY BATES AND SOLAR PANELS. AWAY. BUT WHAT TIME DOES AN INDUSTRY SAY I NO LONGER NEED TO BE SUBSIDIZED BY GOVERNMENT TO BE COMPETITIVE IN THE MARKET. AND I THINK THAT'S THE SAME. WITH VEHICLES BECAUSE AT ONE TIME PEOPLE RUN AROUND WITH HORSES AND THEY THOUGHT YOU KNOW WOULD BE MORE PHYSICALLY GO TO CARS. SO I THINK WHEN YOU DO A CHANGE WITHIN SOCIETY LIKE TRANSPORTATION OR DOCUMENT OR ENERGY ON THE TOP I DON'T MIND. INFUSING NEW TECHNOLOGY. BUT AT SOME POINT YOU NEED TO WEAN THEM OFF AND THEY NEED TO BE COMPETITIVE MAKE IT FAIR. AND AND RUN THE SYSTEM THAT WAY AND THAT BUT THAT'S AN ARGUMENT. DO YOU BELIEVE THE COMPETITIVE MARKET BEST DRIVER YOU THINK GOVERNMENT'S BEST DRIVE AND THAT'S PROBABLY WHERE YOU AND I HAVE A PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCE YOU KNOW MY TAKE A CRACK AT THIS SO ON IN TERMS OF SOLAR PANELS THERE THEN MAYBE THERE'S. A MISPERCEPTION THERE ARE. THERE ARE NO MORE ADVOCATES TO ADVOCATE FOR INCENTIVES FOR. SOLAR PANELS ANYMORE BECAUSE WE'VE DONE THE JOB SOLAR ACTUALLY IS. VEER FAIRLY COST COMPETITIVE IN FAIRLY RECENT PRICE NOW. A DOE SAME. SOLAR FOLKS NOW HAVE GOT INTO THE. SOLAR. THE. THE STORE STICKING. AS I THOUGHT ABOUT IT THEIR DELIGHT BATTERY STORAGE THE STORAGE MARKET SO THAT COULD BE WHAT THEY'RE. TALKING TO BACK THAT'S AND THAT'S THE THIRD LEG OF THE WHEEL THAT IF WE HAVE RENEWABLE ENERGY. THE BEST WAY TO UTILIZED RENEWABLE ENERGY IN THE EVENING WHEN IT'S DARK IS TO STORE DURING THE DAY AND THEN THE USE IT IN THE EVENING. SO I I THINK YOUR POINT IS IT EXTRAORDINARILY WILL TAKE AND I THINK IT GOES BACK TO. MISTER OPENED HIS QUESTION ABOUT THE THE GOAL I THINK THAT THE SENSE OF IF WE COULD GET TO THAT FIVE MILLION GOAL BY TWENTY THIRTY. THE THE CENSUS PERHAPS WE WOULDN'T NEED ANY MORE AYE INCENTIVES OR WE COULD GREATLY RAMPANT DOWN BECAUSE AT THAT POINT. DAN DE AUTOMAKERS WOULD BE MAKING A VARIETY OF VEHICLES A VARIETY OF MARKETS ON WOULD BE WOULD BE NOW OPEN IF I CAN'T GENERAL MOTORS HAS TALKED ABOUT. TWO THIRDS OF THEIR VEHICLES WILL BE ELECTRIFIED BY TWENTY THIRTY SO THEY'RE READY. STARTING TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION CHINA IS FORCING ALL OF THE AUTOMAKERS TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION AS WELL SO I THINK. ON YOUR POINT EXTRAORDINAIRE WELL TAKEN WHICH IS WHY. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE START NOW BUT ALSO TRYING TO SET A GOAL WITH THE IDEA THAT AT SOME POINT IT DOES ACTUALLY GRANT AND I APPRECIATE BECAUSE IT IS A MARKET DRIVEN ISSUE JUST CALL THE. QUESTION YOU KNOW BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND ASSEMBLY WHEN I VOTED AGAINST SUBSIDIES FOR SOLAR. MIGHT PHONES LIT UP AND SO IN THAT MONEY SO GOING OUT NOW SO YOU. WE CAN LOOK AT IT WE CAN DEBATE THAT LATER BUT THAT HAPPENED. THANK YOU. GREAT. WE ARE DONE WITH THAT SECTION WE ARE NOW GOING TO MOVE TO. GENERAL GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC SAFETY. WE WILL START WITH ISSUE ONE HOUSING AND. HOMELESSNESS. ELLIOTT FOR FREE TO BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE IT. THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF BOTH HOUSES TOOK SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS IN THE AREAS OF HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS. THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDED A ONE TIME GENERAL FUND OF ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS. PRIMARILY FOR BLOCK GRANTS TO LOCAL ENTITIES TO FUND A VARIETY OF HOMELESSNESS SERVICES. THE SENATE PROVIDES. ONE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR FOUR YEARS FOR TOTAL FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND FOR A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS. INCLUDING A SOME BLOCK GRANTS TO LOCAL ENTITIES AS WELL AS FUNDING TO CREATE. HOUSING. TARGETED BOTH AT HOMELESS POPULATIONS AND THE BROADER. LOW INCOME POPULATION. ON PAGES EIGHT AND TEN OF YOUR AGENDA ARE DETAILED TABLES OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE TWO HOUSES PACKAGES. AS WELL AS THE KEY DIFFERENCES IN THE BUDGET YEAR OF A JUST TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE HIGH LEVEL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN. THE TWO HOUSES OF FIRST IS AS THE TARGETING THE PRIORITIZATION OF THE FUNDS THE. THE ASSEMBLIES APPROACH. PROVIDES FUNDING TO LOCAL ENTITIES THAT CAN BE USED FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF SERVICES FROM SHELTERS THE OUTREACH TO RENTAL ASSISTANCE OR PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. AND THE. THE DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW TO PRIORITIZE THAT HOW TO PRIORITIZE THAT FUNDING IS IS MOSTLY LEFT WITH THE LOCAL ENTITIES THAT RECEIVE THE FUNDS. THE SENATE ON THE OTHER HAND DOES A SET ASIDE SOME OF THEIR FUNDING FOR BLOCK GRANTS LOCAL ENTITIES THAT WOULD BE. A FLEXIBLE AND USE OF THE DISCUSSION OF THE LOCAL ENTITIES. BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE FUNDING IS. DEDICATED SPECIFICALLY FOR BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND PERMITS SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. A FOR HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AND SO ON IN THE SENATE PACKAGE. THE THE LEGISLATURE WOULD BE TAKING MORE. WOULD WOULD BE. TRADING MORE PRIORITIZATION FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. ANOTHER A KEY AREA OF DIFFERENCE. IS. OF THE THE POPULATIONS THAT WOULD BE SERVED WITH THE PACKAGES THE. ASSEMBLIES PACKAGE IS TARGETED SOLELY AT A. INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES THAT ARE HOMELESS THE SENATE'S PACKAGE AS A MIX OF FUNDING THAT IS TARGETED AT HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES. AND. SOME FUNDING THAT WOULD GO FOR THE BROADER AYE LOW INCOME POPULATION ANOTHER KEY DIFFERENCE. IS THE THE DIFFERENT ACTIONS THAT THE HOUSES TOOK ON THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME PROPOSAL THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED TO PLACE THEIR PLACE LIKE HOME PROGRAM BEFORE THE VOTERS IN NOVEMBER. OF THE SENATE. ADOPTED THIS APPROACH THE ASSEMBLY DID NOT TAKING ACTION AND I THINK. WHATEVER IS DECIDED HERE WILL BE A KEY CONSIDERATION IN DETERMINING HOW TO PRIORITIZE FUNDING. FOR OF A BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING VERSUS SHELTERS OTHER TYPES OF SHORTER TERM SERVICES AYE IF YOU DO GO FOR NO PLACE LIKE HOME THAT COULD A MOVE SOME OF THE SOME. THAT WOULD UNLOCK A TWO BILLION DOLLARS ARE ACCELERATE THE EXPENDITURE OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR PART OF SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. THAT COULD SHIFT SOME OF THE PRIORITY TO. OTHER TYPES OF SERVICES AND OR SHORT TERM SERVICES. THANK YOU ARMS CROSSED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED THREE HUNDRED FIFTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND AS PART OF OUR MAY REVISION. OUGHT TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS OF WHICH SIXTY FOUR MILLION WAS ON GOING FOR VARIOUS HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS MOSTLY THOSE FOCUSED ON OUR CAL WORKS FAMILIES. WE REALLY VIEWED OUR PROPOSAL AS ONE TIME IN NATURE AND BRIDGE FUNDING FOR LOCALS WHILE WE WAIT FOR SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT FUNDING SOURCES TO COME ONLINE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES. NO PLACE LIKE HOME ON GOING BEFORE VOTERS OBVIOUSLY WILL PROVIDE SOME SIGNIFICANT FUNDING ON THE AS THE TO RECORDING FEE WHICH WAS PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND SIGNED INTO LAW BY THE GOVERNOR. AND THEN OF COURSE THE HOUSING BOND THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS PUT ON THE BALLOT FOR THE VOTERS TO DECIDE PLANNING PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY AID. AND I WOULD SAY FOR THE EMERGENCY AID WE REALLY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROVIDED LOCALS WITH MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY TO ADDRESS THEIR UNIQUE COMMUNITY ISSUES AND SO WHEN WE DEVELOPED THE EMERGENCY GRANT. WE REALLY WANTED TO ENSURE BECAUSE IN TALKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAYS AND THE WAY THEY'VE MAY CHOOSE TO ADDRESS THAT WOULD ALSO. BE DIFFERENT. LASTLY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AND WERE REALLY HAVING COORDINATION BETWEEN BOTH CITIES AND COUNTIES TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. ON THE ONE HAND YOU HAVE SOME CAPITAL NEEDS THAT WILL NEED TO BE ADDRESSED I'M FOR HOUSING WHETHER IT'S TEMPORARY OR LONG TERM. THE YOU ALSO IN MANY CASES NEED TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S SERVICES PROVIDED AND THAT'S WHERE THE COUNTIES CAN REALLY. PROVIDE THEIR EXPERTISE WITHOUT WERE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. GREAT THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER. I'M THIS COST IF YOU KNOW IT CAN YOU. WHAT? I WAS NOT KNOWLEDGE THEY. NO PLACE LIKE. PROVED IN I KNOW IT'S. THE DOOR BECAUSE. CORD ISSUES. WE'RE. THEY WOULD BE RESOLVED WITHIN. FOUR TO SIX MONTHS. AND. WHAT PERCENT OF? NO PLACE LIKE HOME MONIES WOULD GO TO PERMANENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. HOW IS IT STRUCTURED? DANIEL BRENDA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I BELIEVE IT ALL GOES TOWARDS PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FAULT NOT EMERGENCY. I DON'T BELIEVE SO. AND WE HAVE THAT SCORED AT TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IF. IT'S APPROVED BY VOTERS. AND THEN. THE. FUNDS THAT COME FROM. DODD TO HONOR FIFTY MILLION A YEAR. FROM THE. A BILL THAT WAS PASSED LAST YEAR. IT. TO. IS THAT MOSTLY FOR PERMANENT AFFORDABLE OR IS IT STRUCTURING. IT'S IN A NUMBER OF BUCKET SO WHAT PERCENT OF IT WOULD GO TO EMERGENCY SHELTER. THE FIRST YEAR FUNDS ARE SPLIT BETWEEN. HOMELESSNESS AND PLANNING IS SO I BELIEVE IT'S THE. HALF OF THE TWO FIFTY EIGHT WILL GO TOWARDS EMERGENCY. I ASK QUESTIONS BECAUSE CLEARLY ARE. THE MAYOR'S ASKED WHICH IS. THE ASSEMBLY STRUCTURES A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO THE ELEVEN MAYORS ASK. IS. THEIR ARGUMENT IS THAT. WE THEIR STE THIS. STREAM NEED RIGHT NOW AND THAT THE PERMANENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS TAKES LONGER. AND THAT. THERE NEEDS TO BE. A. SIGNIFICANT INJECTION OF FUNDS INTO THE EMERGENCY. ADDRESSING THE NEED OF THE PEOPLE ARE LIVING ON THE STREET RIGHT NOW. AND OF COURSE I THINK THE THE SENATE'S CONSTRUCTION WAS NOT TO IGNORE THAT THAT'S REAL BUT RATHER. TO RECOGNIZE THAT. YES YOU CAN PUT FUNDS TOWARDS EMERGENCY WITCHES NOBODY WOULD. QUESTION THAT WE ARE IN A. TOTAL EMERGENCY RIGHT NOW IF YOU JUST WALK DOWN. IT ANY OF IT IN ANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE LIVING ON SIDEWALKS OR INTENT ENCAMPMENTS. BUT THE CONCERN IS OF COURSE. IF WE. AGAIN HOW YOU STRUCTURE HOW MUCH MONEY PUT TOWARDS. A SHORT TERM SOLUTION KNOWING THAT YOU THEN MAY NOT WANT YOUR. SHORT TERM SOLUTION FUNDING IS GONE. THEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE PERMANENT HOUSING FOR THE FOLKS DO THEY GO BACK ON THE STREET. THEY'VE GIVEN. GIVEN THAT. SOME OF THE MONEY THAT'S GOING TO COME AVAILABLE. IS GOING TO BE PRETTY MUCH TOTALLY FOR THE PERMANENT AFFORDABLE. THERE MAY BE. THERE MAY BE AN ARGUMENT FOR STRUCTURING AT LEAST OUR FIRST. INJECTION OF FUNDS A LITTLE HIGHER TOWARDS THE EMERGENCY NEED. AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S. YOUR THE AMOUNT YOU PUT TOWARDS AN EMERGENCY NEED. NOT COUNTING TO NO PLACE LIKE HOME BUT WHAT DOLLAR AMOUNT WAS THAT. WE PROPOSED TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION FOR EMERGENCY HOMELESS EIGHT GRANTS. TO LEARN FIFTY FOR. AND THAT'S AT A GENERAL FUND AND THEN THERE WOULD BE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY NO EXCUSE ME HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE FROM SP TO THAT AND I THINK MINE WAS AS MUCH COMMONERS QUESTION BUT. I'M. I SURRENDER THE FOR RESTRICTING. I JUST GOT UP I GUESS FOR. ON THE WAY THAT WE CONSTRUCTED. I'M OUR ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL IS WE DIDN'T LOOK AT. HOW THE DIVINE THOUGH ONE? POINT FIVE BILLION BY ITSELF BUT I THINK WHAT WE DID WAS TRY TO LOOK AT. THE OVERALL AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT HAS BEEN MADE AVAILABLE FOR PERMANENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WHETHER IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE ASIDE MISS COSTA MATCH INTO THE HOUSING BOND THAT ON THE BALLOT IN NOVEMBER. S. B. TO THE PRO TEM'S BILL THAT PASSED ON AND OUT OBVIOUSLY THE LARGE MAJORITY OF THAT MONEY WAS FOR PERMANENT AFFORDABLE. HOUSING SO WE THOUGHT. THIS IS WHAT WE CONSTRUCTED BASED ON THE OVERALL PICTURE NOT JUST THE. PICTURE FOR THIS YEAR OR THIS FINITE AMOUNT OF MONEY I THINK I WAS THAT I THINK THAT. VANTAGE POINT THAT WE WE TOOK A SHOT AT. SENATE MORE LOCKED AWAY I THOUGHT BEFORE I FORGET ONE ONE QUICK QUESTION CONTRIBUTED TO UNDER FIFTY GENERAL FUND FOR EMERGENCY EIGHT BLOCK GRANTS. WELL I KNOW THAT IT WAS APPROPRIATE TOWARD LOCAL GOVERNMENT ON HOW THE CITIES AND COUNTIES COME TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHETHER THEY WANTED OUR. PROPORTION TO HOW THEY WANT THAT. DIVVIED UP OR WAS IT JUST GONNA BE LIKE GOD RACE FIRST COME FIRST SERVE. WE ACTUALLY UTILIZE THE FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED CONTINUUM'S OF CARE IN OUR MODEL I'M OBVIOUSLY THERE ANOTHER CONDUIT FOR MANY HOUSING PROGRAMS BOTH AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE UTILIZE THEM FOR SOME STATE PROGRAMS. IN OUR CONSTRUCTS BOTTOM WE HAVE THAT AGREE ANTI WOULD PROVIDE ASSURANCES THAT THE CITY AND COUNTY ARE WORKING TOGETHER AS A CONDITION OF THE RECEIPT OF THE GRANT. THANK YOU SEVERAL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I I I GUESS HOA SIM IS BECAUSE I WANT TO THANK YOU TO THE GOVERNOR AND YOU FOR PUTTING A GOOD CHUNK OF MONEY INTO THIS ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS. IT'S ARE BECOMING A BIG ISSUE IN ORANGE COUNTY. BECAUSE JUST AS YOU'VE ENJOYED WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL JUDGE. ON THE PRISONS NOW WE HAVE A FEDERAL JUDGE IS PUSHING US ON HOW TO. GET THESE INDIVIDUALS HOUSE SO. I SEE THIS IS VERY CRITICAL AND I THINK THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME INITIATIVE IS. REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE ASSEMBLY TO LOOK AT. WE'VE CERTAINLY GOT THE SUPPORT OF THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE. FORMER SENATOR. DARRELL STEINBERG GUY ON THIS APPROACH TO TRY AND. SECURITIZED THE INCOME STREAM AND THEN ISSUE THE DEBT. SO I THINK THAT'S. A GOOD INVESTMENT. SO I'D. ENCOURAGE IS SIMPLY TO THINK ABOUT THAT ARE MY COLLEAGUES I WOULD ALSO. ENCOURAGE THE GOVERNOR TO LOOK AT. A BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES OF THE STATE A UTAH'S HAD A PRETTY GOOD SUCCESS. STORY. BUT NO ONE'S PERFECT WE'VE GOT HAVEN OF FOR HOPE IN SAN ANTONIO TEXAS THEY'RE PRETTY GOOD BUT THEY'RE STILL LEARNING EVERY MONTH THAT THEY'RE STILL MORE THAT. NEEDS TO BE ADJUSTED OR MODIFIED. SO WHEN IT COMES TO PERMANENT HOUSING WAS SUPPORT SERVICES. WORKS A LOT BURKE'S WELL NOT PERFECT BUT. WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT SOME OF THESE OTHER MODELS AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT HAVE BEEN. TRYING REAL HARD SO THAT WE CAN BE A SUCCESS STORY. MISTER CHAIR CALIFORNIA IS. LEAST LA'S EXPERIENCED A FORTY PERCENT INCREASE IN HOMELESSNESS JUST IN THE LAST YEAR. AND THE THING WE'RE FACING AN ORANGE COUNTY MAYBE ANOTHER PROJECT THAT WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT HIS. NIMBY ISM JUST YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH IT. IN THAT HOW DO WE GET PAST. THEY KNOW THE FUN STUFF A WITH HOMEOWNERS BEING REAL CONCERN BUT IF YOU DO IT RIGHT. THE HAVEN FOR HOPE IN SAN ANTONE YOU DO RIGHT. IT IT IT IT'S A WIN WIN WIN IT THE PERCEPTION THAT IS THE BIG. PROBLEM SO I JUST WANTED TO ENCOURAGE THE GOVERNOR AND HIS CONSTANT BECAUSE THAT* I ALWAYS HAVE SO MUCH FUN EVERY YEAR SO THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR IN YOUR IN YOUR UPS RIGHT THERE'S SOME. I KNOW SHORTAGEOF NIMBY IS A MAN ANY OF OUR DISTRICTS SO FAIR THAT'S A. EXCELLENT POINT. SENATOR ROBB. ENGLISH TEACHER OF I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD HELP ME HOW DOES THE MONEY FLOW UNDER THESE VARIOUS PROPOSALS DOES IT GO. TO THE COUNTIES AND THEN. DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE COUNTIES WHERE DOES IT GO TO COUNTIES AND CITIES. THAT A FAIR QUESTION. I CAN SPEAK FOR THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL NOW THE FOR TO THE ANALYST ON THE ON LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS I AM AS A SEATED IT GOES TO CONTINUES OF CARE. HE'S OR ENTITIES THAT. FLOW FEDERAL HOUSING DOLLARS AS WELL AS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. FOR SOME OF THE OTHER STATE DOLLARS. ON AND SO A GRANTEE CAN BE A CITY OR A COUNTY THERE REGIONALLY BASED. ON AND IT'S BASED AND ON THE THAT CAN TEAMS OF CARE HOW I'VE KIND OF BROADER. WHAT THEY CALL POINT IN TIME COUNTS FOR EACH OF THE CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT ARE WITHIN THAT REGION? AND SET OUT FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE. STRUCTURE WE'VE CHOSEN. ALONG WITH REQUIRING. TO APPLY FOR THE FUNDS ON THAT THE LOCALITY HAS DECLARED A SHELTER EMERGENCY. A WHICH IS THE GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION THAT ALLOWS ANY POLITICAL SUBDIVISION AND TO DECLARE SHELTER EMERGENCY AND ALLOW. FOR THEM TO GET OUT OF SOME LIABILITY ISSUES CANDIDLY THAT ARE INVOLVED WITH TEMPORARY HOUSING. ON THESE PROBABLY SEEN SOME LOCALITIES IF USED TOUGH SHOTS AND OTHER THINGS AND THEY HAVE UTILIZED BY GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION FOR THAT PURPOSE. ALMONDS OF THE GRANT WOULD ALLOW FOR THAT AS WELL. SO THEORETICALLY IF NOT PRACTICALLY THE MONIES CAN FLOW TO THE. THE AREAS OF GREATEST NEED I WOULD ASSUME. BASED ON. THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS TO GET OUT THAT I THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES ABOUT HOW WE WOULD DO THAT. ONE. MEASURE COULD BE THE POINT IN TIME COUNT ON WHICH IS A FEDERALLY REQUIRED WHERE. LOCALITIES ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY GO OUT AND COUNT THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS IN THEIR LOCALITY. I'M OBVIOUSLY THAT METHODOLOGY IS SUBJECT TO ERRORS IT'S NOT A PERFECT METHODOLOGY. AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS I WOULD NOTE WHEN WE WERE PUTTING FOR THIS PROPOSAL IS. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA'S AROUND THE SAME AS IT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. THE BIG STORY HERE IS THE DIFFERENCE IN SHELTERED VERSES ON SHELTERED AND WE ARE SEEN BIG DIFFERENCES AND THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE I'M SHELTERED. AND UTILIZING THAT DATA WE PUT FORWARD A PROPOSAL REALLY AIMED AT THAT ISSUE. AND AND SO WE HAVE A MORE BLENDED APPROACH IN WHICH WE DON'T ON JUST USE THE POINT AND TIME COUNTS. BECAUSE IT'S. IF THE MEASURE. BUT IT'S IT'S IN PERFECT IN HOW IT'S EXECUTED. DON'T KNOW THAT I KNOW A BETTER MEASURE FOR DETERMINING THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS BUT. ONE WE HAVE DEVELOPED OUR METHODOLOGY WE DID SEE SOME DIFFERENCES IN USING ONLY POINT IN TIME. AS DETERMINING THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS AND I THINK AS I RECALL FROM THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE PROCESS ONE OF THE POINTS. THAT WAS MADE DURING THAT PROCESS IS THE POINT TIME COUNT. PERHAPS DISADVANTAGES OF WHO LOCALES JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE. DONE A BIT MORE TO ADDRESS THE HOMELESS ISSUE IN THE PAST. POINT TIME COUNCIL OF LOWER AND THEIR THEN DISADVANTAGED WHEN IT COMES TIME TO THE DISTRIBUTION FOR THE FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS AND SO I'M. I'M. HOPEFUL THAT SURE BLENDED METHODOLOGY WILL WILL ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS SO AS WE MOVE THIS THING FORWARD. OR ATTEMPTING TO DO THAT THANK YOU HEATHER NOTE I WOULD HAVE ON POINT IN TIME CAL IS. THEN YOU START GETTING INTO ISSUES IN THE POLITIES WHERE MAYBE THEY HAVE A APPROVED AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND SO THAT'S WHY WE WENT WITH THE BLENDED APPROACH SO THAT WE COULD HAVE A MORE NUANCED VIEW OF WHERE THE NEED WAS. AND AND FINALLY IF I CAN ASK ONE MORE ME WHAT WHAT ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT I IF I UNDERSTAND THE. THE BIG CITY MAYORS CORRECTLY IS THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT NOT GETTING APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS FROM COUNTIES IS THAT IS THAT THE ISSUE. ANYBODY CAN ANYONE ADDRESS THAT. I'D SAY THAT THERE IS. TOM TOOK SOME OF THAT CONCERN OR THAT THEIR. THEIR FEELING GUIDE AND OBVIOUSLY IT DEPENDS ON THIS CITY AND THE COUNTY RELATIONSHIP BY THINK THERE IS SOME FEELING IN SOME CITIES THAT THEIR LAST SHOULDERING THE BURDEN. HAVING THE PUBLIC WORKS DOLLARS HAVING THE PUBLIC SAFETY DOLLARS AND NOT GETTING THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED FROM THAT THE COUNTIES. SO THESE PROPOSALS THAT ARE ON THE TABLE ONE OR MORE OF THEM WILL ADDRESS. THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE MISTER CHAIR I THINK THAT THAT IS THE HOPE. THAT IS THE WHOLE DOT NET THAT'S WHY I THINK. IT'S ON THE MAYOR'S AGAIN IS NOT JUST A LARK ALLOCATION EPIC JUST A LARGE CITY MAYORS BE TO ANY CITY. AND I REALLY WOULD GIVE CITIES. A LITTLE MORE DIRECT APPROPRIATION WHICH I THINK THEY FEEL LIKE THEY NEED A LITTLE MORE. ASSISTANCE WITH THEM AND I ACTUALLY WAS THE POINT OF MY FIRST QUESTION WAS TO MAKE TO TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT. WHETHER A CITY FOR EXAMPLE WOULD HAVE AN EQUAL SEAT AT THE TABLE IN TERMS OF TRYING TO GET MONEY. AT THE SAME TIME TO COUNTIES UPON WHAT I THINK THAT IS WHAT. MISS COSTA WAS POLITELY. TALKING ABOUT THAT THAT POINT HAS NOT BEEN SETTLED YET I THINK IT'S PART OF OUR DISCUSSION. DISCUSS IS A LITTLE LATE I WOULD JUST SAVING THE STATE HAS A VESTED INTERESTS ENSURING THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO SOLVE HOMELESSNESS. AT YOU KNOW CAPITAL PROJECTS ALTHOUGH NOT ALWAYS EASY THOSE DOLLARS ARE A LITTLE BIT EASIER TO COME BY. TO. SENATOR MORLOCKS EARLIER GOING AND SOME OF THE POINTS RAISED BY THE COMMITTEE AT THE HOUSING FIRST OR MORE SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. THAT'S WHERE COUNTIES REALLY CAN HELP AND SO I THINK WERE REALLY HOPING FOR A BLENDED MODEL HERE WITH CITIES AND COUNTIES TO ADDRESS WHAT'S. I'M OBVIOUSLY A CRISIS RIGHT NOW THEIR STATE THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR APPRECIATE RESPONSE. OKAY SCENE NO OTHER. ARE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS WE WILL MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO. TAX PER TAX PROPOSALS. GOOD AFTERNOON. BRIAN WEATHERFORD WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. ISSUE TWO IS. ACTUALLY EIGHT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE HOUSE HOUSES. ON. VARIOUS TAX PROVISIONS. AND. TABLE ON PAGE TWELVE SUMMARIZES. THESE DIFFERENCES AND. WRITE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF EACH OF THEM. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND THE HIGHER CREDIT. THE ADMINISTRATION DID NOT HAVE A PROPOSALS. I'M IN THE COST OF THE TABLE. OUR THE GENERAL FUND REVENUE LOSSES WHO TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. AND THEIR RELATIVE TO CURRENT LAW. AND NOT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND SO FOR EXAMPLE MOST OF THESE DON'T HAVE ON THAT AS A MATTER TOO MUCH FROM THE CITIES BUT ON THE. EITC THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OPPOSE SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS. EITC EXPANSION AND SO. THE ASSEMBLY IS ACTION TO FURTHER EXPAND THE EITC TO COVER LOW INCOME WORKING IMMIGRANT FAMILIES CURRENTLY INELIGIBLE. IS AT A COST OF FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. IN ADDITION TO THE SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE. GOVERNORS ON BUDGET PROPOSAL IN THE. BUDGET ADOPTED BY THE SENATE. SO THAT'S A TOTAL COSTS. RELATIVE TO CURRENT LAW ABOUT INFORMED. SO. I WAS GONNA RUN THROUGH ALL OF THESE IN THE INTEREST OF TIME BUT. DID WANT TO HIGHLIGHT TO FOR YOUR ATTENTION. THE SENATE. ACTED TO INCREASE THE RENTER'S CREDIT FOR INFLATION. AND FOR TAX FILERS WITH DEPENDENCE AT A COST OF FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND THE ASSEMBLY ACTED TO MAKE THE CHILD CARE CREDIT. REFUNDABLE AT A COST OF TWENTY SIX MILLION AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN I CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE A PATH. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS OF THE LA OPEN FOR WE MOVE OVER TO THE. DEPARTMENT FINANCE. SEEING NONE MUST COSTA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I JUST KNOW IT'S COMPLETELY APPROPRIATE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ON TAX CREDITS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE BUDGET OBVIOUSLY ANY. TAX CREDITS THAT ARE ULTIMATELY PART OF THE PACKAGE ON IT WILL LEAD TO REVENUE LOSSES. I LIKE THE ANALYST AND JUST GONNA GO THROUGH JUST A COUPLE OF THEM I'M NOT GONNA BELABOR THE MALL BUT CERTAINLY OPEN TO ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. AND THE FIRST I WOULD KNOW IS THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT OBVIOUSLY WE HAD A PROPOSAL AT MAY REVISE TO EXPAND THE EITC TO FIVE HOURS BETWEEN THE AGES OF EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY FOUR. AND OVER SIXTY FIVE THE ASSEMBLY HAS APPROVED ON THAT EXPANSION AND THEY HAVE ALSO AND ADDED A THAT TAXPAYERS THAT USE INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS RATHER THAN SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE. WE WOULD JUST NOTE AGAIN WE HAVE A SCORING DIFFERENCE HERE THE ASSEMBLY ACTION I SCORED THE ANNUAL REVENUE LOSS AT FORTY FOUR MILLION BEGINNING IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. I THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD ESTIMATE THE ANNUAL REVENUE LOSS OF SEVENTY MILLION FOR THAT PROGRAM. THE NEXT THING. I WAS GOING TO HIGHLIGHT HIS OF THE TEACHER TAX DEDUCTION AND THE SENATE APPROVED A TAX DEDUCTION BEGINNING IN EIGHTEEN FOR TEACHERS TO EARN CERTAIN REQUIRED CREDENTIALS. REVENUE LOSSES ARE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND THEN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PER YEAR THERE AFTER. WE WE JUST KNOW THAT ROUGHLY NINETY PERCENT OF PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS HAVE THIS CREDENTIALING PAID FOR BY THEIR EMPLOYERS WITH AND PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. AND IT SEEMS INAPPROPRIATE FUNDING SOURCE FOR THAT WORK. LASTLY. THERE IS AT THE PAYMENT IN LIEU OF TAXES AND WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THIS ACTION IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN BUDGET AGREEMENT AND WHICH WE PROVIDED SIX HUNDRED FORTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS GENERAL FUND TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND GAME. TO OFFSET THE LOSS OF PROPERTY I LOCAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUE FOR STATE WILDLIFE AREAS WITH STATUTORY LANGUAGE THAT CLARIFIES THE PAYMENTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT OUR DISCRETION. WITH THAT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU QUESTIONS SENATOR ROBB. THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR OF. SCOTT TO MAYBE YOU COULD REFRESH MY RECOLLECTION ON THE HIRING CREDIT IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. WHAT THE SENATE THE ACTIONS SENATE TOOK IN THE ACTION THAT THE ASSEMBLY TOOK WHAT AGAIN WAS THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL? SURE WE PROPOSED A CALIFORNIA HIRING CREDITS PROVIDE A STRONGER INCENTIVE FOR EMPLOYERS HIRE HARD TO HIRE INDIVIDUALS. BY EXPANDING THE EXISTING CREDIT IN A COUPLE OF WAYS ONE WE INCREASE THE QUALIFYING WAGE RANGE TO ONE HUNDRED. TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY PERCENT OF MINIMUM WAGE VERSES ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY PERCENT. WE ELIMINATE THE REQUIREMENT THAT NEW HIRES BE LOCATED IN SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC AREAS AND THEN LASTLY WEEKS BE ANSWERED RETAIL AND FOOD SERVICE INDUSTRIES. THE EXISTING HIRING TAX CREDIT WAS UNDER UTILIZED AND SO WE PUT FORWARD A PROPOSAL THAT WE THOUGHT AND WOOD. INCREASE OUR UTILIZATION OF THIS CREDIT. SO THE THRESHOLD IS THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PERCENT OF MINIMUM WAGE. THE DEFICIT WHICH SAID. THE THE THRESHOLD J. CHAIRMAN AND PATTERNS ARE THE THRESHOLD IS AT HIS PROPOSED TO BE A HUNDRED PERCENT OF MINIMUM WAGE UP TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SO FOR PAIN. THREE HUNDRED SIXTY ONLY GET THEIR CREDIT BETWEEN HIGHLIGHTED THREE AND FIFTY THAT MAKES THAT MAKES SENSE ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE ORIGINAL HIRING CREDIT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WAS IT WAS. AS I RECALL HUNDRED AND FIFTY PERCENT OF MINIMUM WAGE IN IS THE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASED. IN SOME PORTIONS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WAS VERY DIFFICULT. FOR AN EMPLOYER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE HIRING TAX CREDITS SO I THINK FRANKLY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT'S A GOOD MOVE. WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE DIFFERENCE UPON THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. APPRECIATE THE EXPANSION ONE OF THE. OPPONENTS. CONCERNS WAS THAT AS A STATE. WE'RE NOT SPENDING ENOUGH MONEY ON OUT OF REACH IT'S ONE THING TO EXPAND THE EITC EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING TO GET TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED TO. FILE IN ORDER TO TAKE CARE OF IT IT DOESN'T DO MUCH EXCEPT. PUT SOMETHING ON THE BOOKS THAT'S UNDER SUBSCRIBED OR UNDER UTILIZED. DID. HAVE WE DONE ANYTHING TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF OUT REACH DOLLARS THAT WEIRD. DEDICATING IN THE BUDGET TO THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM. IF I MAY ASSERTIVE HOUSES ACTED TO PROVIDE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS NOW. FOR THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND THAT'S AN INCREASE OF. WELL THERE IS NOTHING IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SO IT'S AN INCREASE OF TWENTY MILLION. OKAY. AND WHO'S NOT THINK VERY MUCH OF WHICH CHIU IT IF I COULD ASK YOUR QUESTION SENATOR ROBB IS THE QUESTION ALSO WHAT WE SPENT OUT REACH LAST YEAR JUST TO GET A SENSE OF. IF WE'RE DOING BETTER OR NOT I CAN GIVE YOU SOME PASS YOUR NUMBERS ON OUTREACH AND TO AL'S POINT WE DIDN'T BUILD AN OUT REACH INTO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. IN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THE FIRST YEAR THE ITC WAS AVAILABLE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IS BUDGET FOR OUTREACH. I AND WE GOT ABOUT THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND RETURNS I RECEIVE FOR EITC IN THAT YEAR. AND TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. THE OUTREACH WAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY TO TWO POINT SIX MILLION AND THAT HERE TWO MILLION ONE TIME AND SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND ON GOING. ON BUT WE NOTED THAT EVEN WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT INCREASE WE REALLY DIDN'T SEE AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF EITC RETURNS THAT WE RECEIVED. AND THIS YEAR'S TWENTY MILLION. THE LEGISLATURE HAS BUILT AN OUTREACH MONEY GOOD. THANK YOU MEMBERS CHAIR. SENATOR MORE LOCK FOLLOWED BY SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I'M JUST CURIOUS ON THESE. CALIFORNIA HIGHER CREDIT WE WANT TO. ENCOURAGE BUSINESSES TO HIRED. HARD TO HIRE GROUPS IN AND I DON'T KNOW MISTER CHAIR. SUMMER IN OUR DISCUSSIONS THERE IS A PROPOSAL TO DISCONTINUE USING AN OUTSIDE VENDOR THAT USES DEVELOPMENTALLY DISADVANTAGED EMPLOYEES. TO WORK WITH THE PRISON SYSTEMS AND I'M JUST WONDERING WHEN CAN I BRING THAT UP BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED TO PRACTICE WHAT WE PREACH. AND. I I I I I YOU KNOW THERE'S SO MUCH DATA COMING OUT AS AS COMMITTEE MEMBERS. BUT IF WE'RE GONNA TERMINATE A BUSINESS THAT'S. UTILIZING DEVELOPMENTALLY DISADVANTAGED INDIVIDUALS I'D LIKE THAT STEP UP FOR THAT GROUP. THIS ISSUE OF FUNDING FOR THAT GROUP I THINK IS GOING TO BE DISCUSSED BUT THAT PARTICULAR. ISSUE WASN'T IN CONFERENCE BUT. IT IS CORRUPTS. I THINK A LOT A LOT OF OUR TRAILER BILL PASSED YEAH SO I I THINK MAYBE WHEN WE DISCUSS THAT ISSUE. HOME ON WEDNESDAY THAT WOULD BE A GREAT TIME TO BRING UP YOUR GREAT CHAIR THANKS FOR GIVING HIM DIRECTIONS. MY QUESTION IS ON THE HIRING CREDIT SO. WE HAVE. VERY LOW UNEMPLOYMENT. AND CURRENTLY ARE HIRING CREDIT IS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS VERY UNDER UTILIZED. AND YET THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO EXPAND IT. THE LOGIC PLEASE. I KNOW THAT I WOULD CLASSIFY IT AS AN EXPANSION I WOULD SAY THAT THE ORIGINAL HIRING TAX CREDIT WAS REALLY UNDER UTILIZING THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WE ARE AT VERY. LOW UNEMPLOYMENT RATE NOW SO WE'VE TAYLOR DAY IN A WAY TO REALLY TARGET THE HARD HIGHER POPULATION AND THAT INCLUDES PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN RECENTLY INCARCERATED CAL WORKS RECIPIENTS. THOSE WHO EVEN IN THE REALM OF FULL EMPLOYMENT ARE STILL HAVING DIFFICULTY OBTAINING A JOB. SO WOULD WE REVERT THE FUNDS THAT WE. I DON'T KNOW IF WE. WE. IN ADOPTING LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. WE OBVIOUSLY. SHOWED. AN EXPECTATION OF A CERTAIN AMOUNT DID SINCE THE TAX CREDIT IS AN EXPENDITURE. WE EXPECTED A CERTAIN EXPENDITURE WHICH WE DID NOT RECEIVE I THINK THAT SIMILAR TO WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH THE EYE CAN SEE BUT FOR DIFFERENT REASONS. SO WOULD WE BE. I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL IS EXPECTED TO GROW IN IS EXPECTED TO GROW. BECAUSE WE'RE TARGETING A DIFFERENT POPULATION. HOME IF I MAY UM THE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. EXPANDS THE CREDIT AND INTO IMPORTANT HUESO AS ARM WAS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED IT REDUCES THE THRESHOLD AT WHICH EMPLOYEES QUALIFY. FOR THE THE SUBSIDY BY BY MOVING INTO A. A FULL MY HUNTER PERCENT OF MINIMUM WAGE. AND THE SEWERS BILLION WARRIORS YOU COULD MYERS QUALIFIED EMPLOYERS RIGHT KNOWN WILL THE EMPLOYEES THE EMPLOYER QUALIFIES BY HIRING AN EMPLOYEE. OKAY AND UNDER THE EXISTING TAX CREDIT YOU HAVE TO HIRE THE EMPLOYEE THE NEW EMPLOYEE AT A HUNDRED FIFTY PERCENT OF MINIMUM WAGE AT LEAST. AND SO THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BARRIER IN ADDITION IT WAS LIMITED TO CERTAIN ZONES THE STATE FORMER ENTERPRISE ZONES AND WE'RE NEXT THE THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO EXPAND STATEWIDE. OKAY. THANK YOU CENTER ROTH JUST TO FOLLOW UP I I THINK IT'S REALLY VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PAYING. SOMEONE IN THE HARD THE HIGHER CATEGORY THAT IS JUST EXPLAINED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PERCENT OF MINIMUM WAGE. THAT'S PROBABLY MAYBE A BRIDGE TOO FAR YOU'RE LIMITING THE JURORS GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OF THE STATE AND ALSO SOME OF THE OCCUPATIONS DID WE CHANGE THAT AS WELL. YES WHAT WE WE CHANGE THE INDUSTRIES THAT INDUSTRY RECALL. SO PLAYERS. UNDER OUR PROPOSAL WOULD BE COULD BE IN THE RETAILER OR FOOD SERVICES. SO THAT'S IMPORTANT. SPANNING THE GEOGRAPHY AND LOWERING THE THRESHOLD TO A HUNDRED PERCENT OF MINIMUM WAGE FOR THE TARGETED GROUP OF POTENTIAL EMPLOYEES WERE TALKING ABOUT. I THINK WE WOULD BE INTERESTING TO SEE AN OBVIOUSLY WE WILL BE STUDYING IT WATCHING IT SO WHEN YOU I THINK WE WILL BE EXPANDING THIS PROGRAM I THINK IS FOR HIM DOES A VERY IMPORTANT CHANGES. DOCTOR ABOUT. I WANTED A COMMENT IN THIS AREA IF I COULD. I. IN THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THIS HIRING CREDIT I KNOW YOU HAVE SAID THAT IT HAS NOT BEEN SUBSCRIBED WELL BUT I THINK IT'S. THE PORN TO PUT NUMBERS TO IT. MY UNDERSTANDING IS WE'VE HAD WANTED TO PERCENT PARTICIPATION BASED ON HOW MUCH WE'VE ALLOCATED FOR THIS TAX CREDIT. AND IT'S BECAUSE OF THE DECISIONS THAT WE'VE. MADE AND HOW WE'VE. STRUCTURE DISCREDIT. I WANTED JUST PUT A TIMESTAMP NOW TO RE EVALUATE THIS PROGRAM AFTER YEAR TO SEE IF THE CHANGES IN THE VARIABLES. HAVE WORKED IF WEATHERED. OR CHANGING FROM RESTAURANTS AND RETAILS OR PAT DECREASING FROM A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO A HUNDRED PERCENT REALLY DO HELP. BECAUSE. ONE OF THE WAYS THAT I DO THINK WE CAN MAKE SURE THIS PROGRAM IS SUBSCRIBED TO IS HAVING A PROGRAM. THAT WE CAN COMMUNICATE WELL TO THE RETAILERS AND RESTAURANTS IN THE BUSINESSES WHO WILL USE THESE TAX CREDITS. AND MY CONCERN IS ON HOW WE'VE STRUCTURED CONCERNED JUST GONNA VOICE THAT CONCERN BUT THE. THIRTY FIVE PERCENT ABOVE MINIMUM WAGE REALLY DOES DISPROPORTIONATELY HURT THOSE WHO ARE ON THE LOWER END OF THE WAGE SCALE VERSUS THOSE WHO ARE. TURNING THIRTY DOLLARS AN HOUR VERSES ELEVEN DOLLARS AN HOUR AND IT. WANTING TO FIGURE OUT IF THIS PROGRAM IS NOT SUBSCRIBED TO. DO WE IN FUTURE YEARS COME BACK TO EVALUATE WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A DIFFERENT MECHANISM. TO HAVE THIS TAX CREDIT IF THERE'S A DOLLAR PER HOUR. THAT WE COULD BE APPLYING UNTIL WE REACHED A THRESHOLD WHERE IF THERE'S ANOTHER WAY WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE BETTER THAN ONE TO TWO PERCENT PARTICIPATION IN THIS TAX. IF I MAY I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD SUPPORT RE EVALUATING THIS I WOULD NOTE THOUGH FOR A TAX CREDIT ONE YEAR IS LIKELY NOT ENOUGH BECAUSE THERE'S A QUALIFYING EVENTS THAT HAPPENS IN THIS CASE THE HIRING OF AN INDIVIDUAL. BEFORE THE COMPANY CAN GO BACK AND CLEAN THEIR CREDIT AND SO THAT WOULD LIKELY TAKE LONGER TO HAVE A. REAL EVALUATION WITH MEANINGFUL DATA THANK YOU. ETCETERA. I APOLOGIZE MISTER CHAIR HE'S GOING TO GET THE HOOK COME FROM A PRETTY QUICKLY HERE. ELIOT DID YOU AYE HAVING SAID WHAT I SAID ABOUT. REDUCING THE THRESHOLD FROM A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PERCENT OF MINIMUM WAGE TWO HUNDRED PERCENT. THE Z.. LEGISLATIVE ANALYST HAVE ANY FURTHER SUGGESTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THIS. HIRING CREDIT PROGRAM AS WE'RE SITTING HERE AND BEFORE WE MAKE DECISIONS. AND IF SO WHAT. WILL WE DO SENATOR UP AS YOU NOTED. THE TAX CREDIT IS IS THIRTY FIVE PERCENT OF A QUALIFIED PORTION OF THE EMPLOYEES WAGE SO THAT PORTION STARTS AT A HUNDRED PERCENT OF MINIMUM WAGE. SO FOR. DIFFICULT TO HIRE INDIVIDUALS THEY MAY NOT BE PAID MUCH MORE THAN MINIMUM WAGE. OTHER CERTAINLY CERTAINLY POSSIBLE. THAT THE BUT BUT THE AMOUNT OF THE TAX CREDIT TO THE EMPLOYER MAY ONLY BE. SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS IF EMPLOYEES PAID SAY TWELVE FOR TWELVE DOLLARS AN HOUR SO. ONE OF OUR SITES SUGGESTIONS THAT WE SHARED WITH YOUR STAFF WAS PERHAPS OF STRUCTURING THE CREDIT. TO. AT THE FOOL. IF THEY'RE FULL WAGE THIRTY FIVE PERCENT WERE SMALLER PERCENTAGE MAYBE TWENTY PERCENT OF THEIR FULL WAGE OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PERCENT OF MINIMUM WAGE. AND WE THINK THAT WOULD. INCREASE THE TAKE UP. CONSIDERABLY AND SO YOU MAY WANT TO MORE NARROWLY FOCUSED THE CREDIT AS WELL SO FRONT LOADING IT AND IN OTHER WORDS RIGHT SO THAT THE. THAT THE. YOU KNOW YOU WILL GET A MAXIMUM CREDIT MINIMUM WAGE THE CREDIT WOULD STILL GROW FOR A PERIOD OF TIME WHERE THE CREDITS RECEIVE BY THE EMPLOYER. BUT THAT AT LEAST A UNITED MINIMUM WAGE OR JUST ABOVE MINIMUM WAGE. <u>&lt;c.green&gt; EMPLOYERS&lt;/c&gt;</u> RECEIVING A TAX CREDIT OF SAY ONE OR TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH MIGHT PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO HIRE THEM. A HARD HIGHER EMPLOYEE WHERE IS UNDER THE CURRENT PROPOSAL. YOU ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE CREDIT UNTIL YOU PAY THE EMPLOYEE HUNDRED FIFTY PERCENT OF MINIMUM WAGE AND UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL YOU DON'T RECEIVE A TAX CREDIT. INTEL IT'S ABOVE MINIMUM WAGE IN THAT IT'S VERY VERY SMALL. WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROGRAM ANY OTHER SUGGESTIONS THAT WE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING. WE ALSO. NOTED THAT. BOTH BOTH HOUSES EXPRESSED RESERVATIONS WITH EXPANDING THE CREDIT TO RETAIL AND FOOD SERVICE BUSINESSES SO WE WOULD RECOMMEND. OMITTING ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED LANGUAGE TO RESTORE THE RESTRICTIONS ON QUALIFY TAXPAYERS IN ADDITION THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE PUBLIC REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. THE ADDRESS ALTHOUGH WITH RESPECT TO THE EXPANDED INDUSTRIES THOSE OUR INDUSTRIES WHERE IT WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO. FOR EMPLOYER HIRE SOME OF THESE OF. DIFFICULT TO HIRE. EMPLOYEES. POSSIBLY I MEAN IT I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON YOUR POLICY GOALS AS. IF YOU'RE TRYING TO ESTABLISH WORK HISTORY. FIRST FOR SOME FOR SOME PEOPLE ANY JOB WOULD BE A GOOD JOB BUT. BUT WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THERE ARE RESERVATIONS WITH EXTENDING IT TO THOSE INDUSTRIES AND WHAT WERE THE ISSUES WITH RESPONSIBLE IF RESPECT TO THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. CURRENTLY THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. HAS A WEBSITE THEY MAINTAIN THAT. PROVIDES THE NAME OF EACH QUALIFY TAXPAYER WHO CLAIMS THE TAX CREDIT. AND WE UNDERSTAND THIS IS A A BIT OF A BURDEN FOR THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD BECAUSE OF. CPAS PARTICULARLY PARTNERSHIPS TRACING. TRACING THAT THE TAX FILINGS IS JUST. WINTERSON IS BURDENSOME FOR THAT GROUP OF TAXPAYERS. I ACTUALLY WAS AROUND AT THE INCEPTION OF THIS BUT I DON'T RECALL THE ORIGINS OF THEIR REPORTING REQUIREMENT DO YOU. I WASN'T AROUND THAT. FINANCED YOU RECALL. NO I I'VE I WAS THAT I WAS THERE AT THE TIME BUT I DON'T RECALL THAT WE WERE THERE TOGETHER. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU. OKAY SEEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS WILL MOVE TO ISSUE THREE CANNABIS. HELLO THE BORDERS. BRIAN BROWN ANALYST'S OFFICE I ISSUE THREE RELATED TO CANNABIS LICENSING AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES. THE GOVERNOR OF MAY REVISION INCLUDED A HUNTIN THIRTY THREE MILLION. ANNUALLY FOR TWO YEARS. FOR FOURTEEN DIFFERENT APART TO DO DIFFERENT LAST WEEK LIKE FIFTEEN AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES. BOTH HOUSES ADOPTED THE MAY REVISION PROPOSALS IN FULL JUST WITH THREE. THREE CHANGES. THE FIRST OF WHICH IS THE ASSEMBLY ADOPTED A TWENTY FIVE MILLION. LOAN FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO BE USED FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES AND TO BE ADMINISTERED BY THE BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS. THAT GENERAL FUND LOAN WILL BE REPAID IN THE FUTURE FROM THE CANNABIS TAX FUND. YOU ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE WE JUST KNOW THAT THE USE OF THE FUNDING FOR THIS PURPOSE IS ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WITH THE ALLOWABLE USES UNDER PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR FOR THE TAX FIND. BUT THE. PROPOSITION DIDN'T HAVE EXPLICIT LANGUAGE AROUND LOANING THAT FIND. FOR THE PITTSBURGH FOR FUTURE FOR EARLIER YEARS AND THE REVENUE WOULD BE AVAILABLE THIS PROPOSED HERE SO. IF THIS CONTINUES TO BE PART OF THE ULTIMATE BUDGET PACKAGES MAY WANT TO CONSULT WITH COUNSEL ON. ON THAT TECHNICAL ISSUE. THE SECOND A CHAMBERS ADOPTED BY BOTH HOUSES THERE'S REALLY NOT A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR HOUSES BUT BETWEEN YOU AND THE ADMINISTRATION. THAT IS THE. IMMIGRATION A PROPOSED FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FROM. THE CANNABIS TAX FIND IT TO BE USED FOR DIFFERENT STATEWIDE ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES BOTH HOUSES CHANGE THAT FUNDS WERE FROM THE TAX FUND TO THE GENERAL FUND. OTHER CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER GIVING THE TAX ON FOR THIS PURPOSE. WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF PROPOSITION SIXTY FOURTH CURRENTLY WRITTEN AS WELL THE FACT THAT USING THE TAX FUND FOR THAT PURPOSE WOULD ALSO POTENTIALLY CROWD OUT OTHER USES IN THE FUTURE. IN THE THIRD CHANGE IS THE SENATE ADDED A TOTAL OF TEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO ASSIST EQUITY APPLICANTS. THESE ARE LICENSE APPLICANTS WHO ARE FROM COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN HARMED BY THE STATE'S STRICTER DRUG POLICIES OF THE PAST. THE TOTAL FUNNY IN INCLUDES ABOUT A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN IN THE. CANNABIS CONTROL FRONT AND THEN. TEN MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND FOR GRANTS AND ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE AYE I THINK ULTIMATELY THAT GENERAL FUND. USAGE IF THAT LIKELY QUESTION OF WHETHER A PROVIDING ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING FOR THIS SUBSET OF LICENSEES AND WE KNOW THERE. ARE. MORE AWARE OF ABOUT FOUR COMMUNITIES SO FAR HAVE IMPLEMENTED EQUITY PROGRAMS OTHER MAYBE MORE THAT ARE CONSIDERING AS WELL. WHETHER QUESTION OF. PROVIDING FUNDING FOR THOSE SUBSTANTIVE LICENSEES IS A TELEPHONE PRIORITY FOR YOU. THANK YOU MISS COSTA. THANK YOU ALL TRY TO DUPLICATE WHAT THE ANALYST HAS AB POINTED OUT BUT. AS HE SAID DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WE ALL FUNDED IT WE JUST USE DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES AND THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED THE USE OF THE CANNABIS TAX FOUND IN BOTH HOUSES UTILIZED THE GENERAL FUND FOR THAT PURPOSE. SECONDLY. THE ASSEMBLY HAS INCLUDE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND LOAN TO BE REPAID BY THE CANNABIS TAXED FUND FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WE DON'T SUPPORT PROVIDING FUNDING TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO ENFORCE ILLEGAL CANNABIS ACTIVITIES IN THE BUDGET YEAR. THAT'S THE SIXTY FOUR OUR PARTY PROP SIXTY FOUR SPECIFIES FUNDING FROM THE CANNABIS TAX FUNDS FOR EDUCATION. PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS CLEANUP REMEDIATION AN INFORMANT ENFORCEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS CREATED BY CANNABIS CULTIVATION AND PUBLIC SAFETY PROGRAMS. BASED ON THE CURRENT REVENUE ESTIMATES FUNDING FOR THESE PROGRAMS WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE UNTIL TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. WITHOUT STATUTORY CHANGES THAT. LIKELY WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE VOTERS. WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THESE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES CAN BE PRE FUNDED. LASTLY OF ELSE NOTED. THE SENATE HOUSE A PROPOSAL FOR EQUITY PROGRAMS IN THE ADMINISTRATION NOTES THE MERITS OF THIS PROPOSAL WE ARE SYMPATHETIC. TO. REDUCING BARRIERS TO CANNABIS LICENSURE FOR THOSE WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY THE WAR ON DRUGS WE DO WORRY THOUGH SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE PROPOSAL'S LOAN PROGRAM COMPONENT. ó WE SOUGHT A SOLUTION TO. CANNABIS BANKING AND WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT'S COMPLICATED. ON END SO WE WORRY ABOUT HOW WE WOULD AND UTILIZE A LOAN ON GIVEN THOSE COMPLEXITIES FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU EARLIER YES. I JUST ONE POINT OF CLARIFICATION ANYTHING IS IS THE CONVERSATIONS OF CONTINUE TO EVOLVE I THINK THE PURPOSE. FOR THE EQUITY APPLICANTS WOULD BE FOR A GRANT PROGRAM NOT FOR. NOT FOR LOANS. THANK YOU. GOOD LUCK TO THE COMMITTEE. OKAY. GOHAN WANTS. YEAH OCCUR. DONE. ISSUE FOR YOU THREE INVESTMENT FUND ADULT REENTRY INTO VERSION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND VICE CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JONATHAN PETERSON WITH THE LA THOUGH. ON PAGE TWENTY OF YOUR AGENDA WE DID PREPARE A HAND OUT OUTLINE. DIVERSION A AND REENTRY PROGRAMS FOR THAT EACH HOUSE APPROVED. I WON'T GO OVER EACH OF THE PROGRAMS BUT FOR WHAT THE PROGRAMS ENTAIL BUT I WILL SAY THAT THE GOVERNOR DID NOT HAVE A PROPOSAL IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET RELATED TO DIVERSION AND REENTRY PROGRAMS. BOTH HOUSES INCLUDED ONE TIME FUNDING FROM THE GENERAL FUND FOR THESE PROGRAMS. THE CIVIC GLEE THE SENATE INCLUDED ONE HUNDRED MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDING THIS INCLUDED THIRTY FIVE MILLION FOR GENERAL DIVERSION PROGRAMS. FIFTY MILLION FOR REENTRY PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE HOUSING SERVICES AND FIFTEEN MILLION FOR SOCIAL WORKERS I FOR USE IN PUBLIC DEFENDERS OFFICES. THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES WOULD ALLOCATE THOSE FUNDS. THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDING SLIGHTLY HIGHER THIS INCLUDED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION FOR DIVERSION PROGRAMS FOR AT RISK YOUTH. TEN MILLION FOR DIVERSION PROGRAMS FOR NATIVE AMERICAN YOUTH. THEY ALSO ALLOCATED FIFTY MILLION FOR THE HOUSING RE ENTRY SERVICES AND OF THE FIFTEEN MILLION FOR SOCIAL WORKERS IN PUBLIC DEFENDERS OFFICES. AND THEY INSTEAD OF PROVIDE THE AUTHORITY FOR THESE FUNDS TO THE BORDER STATE COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS. THERE IS ALSO TRUE PLAY A PLACEHOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR RE ENTRY INTO VIRGIN PROGRAMS THE SENATE ALSO HAD TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE RELATED TO. CEILING OF RECORDS FOR CERTAIN OFFENDERS. THE PACKAGE OF PROGRAMS THAT IS ULTIMATELY ADOPTED AS A MATTER OF LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY SO WE DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHICH PACKAGE TO APPROVE. WE DID HAVE SOME FACTORS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. WELL FOR EXAMPLE THE EXTENT TO WHICH DIVERSION PROGRAM SHOULD BE TARGETED TO SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ARE SPECIFIC TYPES OF SERVICES IS SOMETHING YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER. WHICH STATE ENTITY IS MOST EQUIPPED TO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAMS WHETHER FUNDS SHOULD BE ALLOCATED ON A COMPETITIVE BASIS THE SPECIFIC CRITERIA THAT SHOULD BE USED IN ALLOCATING THE FUNDS AND FINALLY WHETHER TO INCLUDE A. EVALUATION COMPONENT FOR THE PROGRAMS THAT RECEIVE FUNDING. HAVING TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU MISS COST. ABSENT POLICY MERITS OF THESE AB PACKAGES OBVIOUSLY THESE ARE GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATIONS THAT WERE INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR'S FISCAL PLAN JUST A COUPLE TECHNICAL NOTES IN THE HOUSE BROUGHT IT UP WE DO HAVE CONCERNS FOR THE SENATE PROPOSAL HOW THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES ADMINISTERED THE YOUTH AND ADULT. RE ENTRY AND DIVERSION PROGRAM GRANTS JUST BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT TYPICALLY ADMINISTERED THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS AND SO WE THINK THAT THERE'S LIKELY A BETTER ADMINISTRATIVE ENTITY. TO ADMINISTER THAT PROGRAM. ON AND THEN ON THE SENATE YOUTH AND ADULT REENTRY INTO A VERSION AND. PROGRAM PACKAGE AS A WHOLE WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF DETAILS AND AS SUCH WE CAN'T REALLY COMMENTS. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. HER SKIRT. IF WE NEED LOOK AT THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. THEY ADMINISTER A LOT OF. GRANT PROGRAMS. AND FOR EXAMPLE THEY HAVE. AND STILL DO ADMINISTER VARIOUS GRANT PROGRAMS THAT. HAVE AN OVERLAP WITH SOME TYPES OF RE ENTRY SERVICES. SO THERE THERE ARE. EXISTING STRUCTURES THAT. THE DIFFERENT PROPOSALS PRESENTED HERE COULD FIT IN. THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ASSEMBLY SAN ME. SENATE'S ACTION WHICH WAS ALREADY POINTED OUT BUT BASICALLY BOTH HOUSES. SUPPORTED THE FIFTEEN MILLION TO PUT SOCIAL WORKERS IN PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE SUPPORTED FIFTY MILLION FOR RE ENTRY HOUSING. IF WE TALKED TO THE IF WE TALK TOWARD COUNTIES IF WE TALK TO OUR. ENTITIES THAT DO RE ENTRY SUPPORT AND EVEN TO CDC ARE BECAUSE NOW OUR CORRECTIONS DIVISION CASTING DO. EVERY ENTRY PLAN. BEFORE PEOPLE ARE RELEASED AND THE BIGGEST ISSUE THAT COMES UP AGAIN AND AGAIN IS WHERE THESE FOLKS GOING TO BE HOUSED. AND. SO BOTH HOUSES FELT TO IS PROPRIOCEPTIVE BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT WE'VE IN EVERY INQUIRY WE MAKE AS TO WHAT'S ONE OF THE LARGEST NEEDS WERE TOLD. YOU KNOW AND IT RARE TREAT HOUSING. AND THEN THE AREAS THAT. WAS JUST LANDED ON MUTUALLY WAS AROUND THE U. THREE INVESTMENT. AND SO CLEARLY THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT IF WE CALL THIS ITEM OPEN BUT THERE WAS A GREAT MERIT TOO MANY OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WERE DISCUSSED. WITHIN THAT YOU THREE INVESTMENT. HERTZBERG. FOR DIVERSION CORRECT IT WASN'T FOR RE ENTRY IS FOR DIVERSION BUT OBVIOUSLY. IT'S LIKE ANY AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION IS WORTH A POUND OF CURE IF WE CAN KEEP PEOPLE FROM EVEN. ENTERING OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ALL THE BETTER AND THAT'S THE FOCUS OF THE YOUTH. INVESTMENT PROGRAM. THANK YOU. OKAY I'M NOT SEEING ANY. DOCTOR ROBERT. I MISS COSTA YOU SAID THAT THERE WAS A. DEPARTMENT THAT MAY BE ABLE TO BETTER OVERSEE THAT PROGRAM AND I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD ELUCIDATE WHICH DEPARTMENT THAT WOULD BE. JOSH DUGGAR DEPARTMENT FINANCE SO GENERALLY SPEAKING. SIMILAR PROGRAMS LIKE THIS HAVE BEEN FUNDED WITH THE BOARD OF SEEN CONNIE CORRECTIONS IN THE PAST AND OBVIOUSLY DEPENDING ON THE YOU KNOW VARIATION OF WHAT IS ACTUALLY BEING FUNDED AND THE. REENTRY POPULATION THAT IS FOCUSED ON I THINK THAT THERE'S ALSO A ROLE FOR HER CCAR'S FUNDING. CCR TO. BEING. OVERSEEN SIGNIFICANT FUNDING IN THIS AREA AS WELL TO THE EXTENT THAT IT'S PAROLEES WHICH I THINK UNDER CERTAIN VARIATIONS OF THE LANGUAGE. WOULD INCLUDE PAROLEES. SENATE NIELSEN. SOARING NIELSEN. JUST A CAUTION THIS IS NOT JUST A REALLY EASY AREA TO DEAL WITH THERE'S A LOT OF COMPLICATIONS. COOPER HOW YOU CRAFT THE PROGRAM. THERE IS A BOTTLE THAT DID WORK. FOR YEARS AND YEARS. IT'S CALLED. THE DRUG COURT. I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE MODELED ON THE DRUG COURT. BUT. THE POINT IS. IT IT IT'S JUST NOT AN EASY THING AND I WOULD BE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH HAVING THIS BE DEFINED IN A TRAILER BILL. THAT DOES NOT BE SUBJECTED TO EXHAUSTIVE COMMITTEE HEARING POLICY COMMITTEE. GREAT THANK YOU. OKAY RUNNERUP FINISH UP WITH ISSUE FIVE DISCRETIONARY FUNDING IN QUIRK. REPORTERS IN FAMILY COURT TO REVIEW. I NEED ONLY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TWENTY SIX OF YOUR AGENDA WE FIRST PROVIDE JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND. ON THE JUDICIAL BRANCHES WORKLOAD ALLOCATION AND FUNDING METHODOLOGY BETTER KNOWN AS WELL FROM. IT WAS IMPLEMENTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN BY THE JUDICIAL BRANCH AND WAS INTENDED TAP IDENTIFY TRIAL COURT FUNDING NEED AS WELL AS TO ALLOCATE FUNDING BASED ON WORKLOAD. AND SO UNDER CHANGES THAT WERE ADOPTED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR ANY NEW GENERAL PURPOSE FUNDING THAT'S PROVIDED FOR TRIAL COURT OPERATIONS. WOULD FIRST GO TO THE FIFTEEN SMALLEST COURTS TO MEET THEIR FOR LA FROM IDENTIFY NEED. AND THEN FIFTY PERCENT OF ANY OF THE REMAINING AMOUNT WOULD GO TO THE COURTS THAT WERE BELOW THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE AND THAT ANY REMAINING AMOUNT WOULD GO TO ALL. THE COURTS BASED ON WORKLOAD. TO RETURN TO THE NEXT PAGE OF YOUR AGENDA WHO THE TABLE HERE THAT KIND OF SUMMARIZES THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL AS WELL AS THE ACTIONS OF BOTH HOUSES. UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL THEY PROPOSE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION AND ONGOING GENERAL FUND SUPPORT. THIS BREAKS DOWN TO FORTY SEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION FOR EQUALIZATION AND BOTH HOUSES AGREED ON THAT. AND THE REMAINING AMOUNT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION WOULD BE FOR DISCRETIONARY FUNDING TO GO TO JUDICIAL COUNCIL FOR ALLOCATION BASED ON ITS PRIORITIES AND THIS IS WHERE THE TWO HOUSES DEFERRED. THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDED THIRTY MILLION JUDICIAL COUNCIL BUT SHIFTED THIRTY MILLION FOR ALLOCATION UNDER WATER. AND THEN SHIFTED FIFTEEN MILLION FOR THE SUPPORT OF COURT REPORTERS IN FAMILY LAW PROCEEDINGS. THE SENATE SHIFTED ALL SEVENTY FIVE MILLION FOR ALLOCATION UNDER WATER FROM AN ADDED TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR COURT REPORTERS. IN FAMILY LAW PROCEEDINGS. THE SENATE ALSO ADOPTED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE GENERALLY REQUIRED REPORTERS IN FAMILY LAW PROCEEDINGS AND SPECIFY WHAT KEEPS TYPES WOULD HAVE PRIORITY OF INSUFFICIENT FUNDING WAS AVAILABLE. AS WELL IS BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE REQUIRING OUR OFFICE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO EVALUATE Y. FROM BY NOVEMBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN. IF YOU LOOK AT THE RIGHT MOST COLUMN OF THIS TABLE WE DO HAVE A COMPROMISE FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. UNDER THE COMPROMISE IT WOULD BE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION. FORTY SEVEN POINT EIGHT GOING TO EQUALIZATION SIXTY MILLION GOING OUT ON A WALK OFF ON AND FIFTEEN MILLION FOUR COURT REPORTERS. AND ALSO THE SENATE LANGUAGE WOULD BE ADOPTED. IF YOU TURN TO THE NEXT PAGE OF YOUR HAND UP PAGE THIRTY THE REASON FOR THIS COMPROMISE IS THAT IT WOULD GENERALLY SPECIFY FUNDING FOR LEGISLATIVE PROP. PRIORITIES RATHER THAN GIVING JUDICIAL COUNCIL COMPLETE DISCRETION. ADDITIONALLY THE SENATE'S PROPOSED LANGUAGE WOULD REALLY INCREASE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OF TRIAL COURT FUNDING WITHOUT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THIS COST. I THINK THE COURT ACTION CORE ISSUE HERE IS THE FLEXIBILITY THAT WE WOULD HAVE AFFORD THE JUDICIAL COUNCILS SO. ID MINISTRATION AS NOTED PROPOSED ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION SEVENTY FIVE MILLION OF WHICH IS DISCRETIONARY OUT TO SUPPORT TROUT CORE OPERATIONS PROVIDE RESOURCES AND FLEXIBILITY. FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND COURTS TO FIND LOCAL LEVEL PRIORITIES. WHICH COULD INCLUDE COURT REPORTING WE WOULD KNOW THAT CURRENTLY THIRTY EIGHT OF THE FIFTY EIGHT TRIAL PORTS YEARS GENERAL OPERATING FUNDING. OUGHT TO PROVIDE COURT REPORTERS IN AT LEAST SOME FAMILY LAW CASES WITH THAT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. SENATOR BROCK. SCOTT SO ROOMS LAST TIME THE GOVERNOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE GIVEN INCREASE OF FUNDING TO THE JUDICIAL. BRANCH. IT HASN'T OCCURRED DURING MY TENURE. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. MISTER OBERNOLTE. MISTER CHAIRED WELL. I'M SURE YOU ALL KNOW BASED ON OUR PREVIOUS YEARS EXPERIENCE THAT I'M A BIG PROPONENT OF TRIAL COURT FUNDING INCREASING THAT FUNDING AND IT COMES OUT OF. MY EXPERIENCES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS. MAYOR OF A COMMUNITY LOST A COURTHOUSE. SO I'M I'M A BELIEVER THAT FUNDING TRIAL COURTS INCREASES ACCESS TO JUSTICE DON'T THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RESPONSIBILITIES OF GOVERNMENT ARE. THAT BEING SAID I AM VERY MUCH A FAN OF THE ILLEGAL COMPROMISED. JUST BECAUSE I THAT THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA MAXIMIZE THE FUNDING FOR THOSE TRIAL COURTS AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THE MONEY NEEDS TO GO. THANK YOU CENTER A. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YOU KNOW I I WOULD. TEND TO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM. BIG BEAR THE WAFFEN FORMULA WAS DEVELOPED TO TRY TO. DEAL WITH AS SOME HISTORICALLY IMBALANCE IN THE WAY THE FUNDS WERE DISTRIBUTED IN HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND. I THINK IF ANYTHING WE SHOULD EMPHASIZE OF THE USE OF THAT FORMULA NOT RETURNED TO. HISTORIC PRACTICES WHERE MONEY WAS DISTRIBUTED. IN A PARTICULAR WAY JUST BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY IT ALWAYS BEEN DISTRIBUTED DESPITE. OF THE MOVEMENT AND SHIFT IN POPULATION FROM THE HIGHLY URBANIZED COASTAL AREAS TO. IN CALIFORNIA A NORTH SOUTH SO. I'M CERTAINLY A FAN OF THE WATSON FORMULA AND WHICH SPORT EITHER ACTUALLY EITHER APPROACH THE SENATE OVER THE ALEJO COMPROMISE IN THAT REGARD. THANK YOU SIR NIELSEN IF I MEAN REALLY QUICK ON THE POINT OF LAW FROM THE ADMINISTRATION DOES HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO DO IT IN THE SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD AND WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE ADEQUATE RESOURCES. ON TO WORK ON AND WITH THE HOUSE IS PROPOSING. AND IF I'M JUST GOING BACK TO SENATOR MORLOCKS QUESTIONS SORRY WE'RE KIND OF SICKLY BUT IN TERMS OF AUGMENTATIONS TO THE TRIAL COURT. WE ACTUALLY PROVIDED IN BASELINE FUNDING AND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS THE YEAR BEFORE THAT FIFTEEN SIXTEEN NINETY ONE MILLION DOLLARS AND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN EIGHTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS AND IN THIRTEEN FOURTEEN SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS. THESE WERE ONGOING BEEZ AUGMENTATIONS ON TOP OF THAT FUNDING WAS PROVIDED FOR INCREASED BENEFIT CAUSTIC CENTER OF. THANK YOU SERIOUS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. THERE'S A LONG HISTORY AS YOU'VE NOTED THAT THIS AND I WAS. PRESENT AT THE BIRTH EVEN IN THE CONCEPTION OF THIS TRIAL COURT FUNDING. AND IT HAS A LONG AND STORIED HISTORY THAT THOSE ALSO HARKEN TO SOMETHING I SPEAK A LOT ABOUT AND THAT IS TRUST. IT'S ONE OF THE FEW TIMES IN HISTORY. RELEASED IN THE HISTORY OF MY DEALINGS WITH THE LEGISLATURE WHERE THE. COUNTIES. COULD KEEP THEIR TRUST IN THE STATE. ANOTHER WORDS AT THE STATE CAPITOL WORD. THE COUNTY'S PROVIDING THE TRIAL COURT FUNDING. AND. ANY GREAT DEPARTURES. FOR MORE WHERE THAT CAUSES ME. CONCERN. HEY AND. THE THE CURRENT SYSTEM. SHE DID CORRECT INEQUITIES THAT DID DEVELOP. HIS. PREDICTABLE. THERE'S NO. AND COUNTIES HAVE. PLANNED BASED ON WHAT THEIR EXPECTATION WAS. THAT SAID THEN I'M A LITTLE BIT WARY ABOUT CHANGING THINGS VERY MUCH. AND THE TO THAT DEGREE GIVING THE LEGISLATURE MORE DISCRETION. I'M USUALLY ONE THAT WOULD ADVOCATE THAT. BUT OVER THE DECADES ONE OF THE KEYS TO THE SUCCESS OF THE TRIAL COURT FUNDING IS PEOPLE COULD TRUST IT. IT WAS PREDICTABLE. I WOULD ASK HE SIMPLY AS WE PROCEED KEEP THEM FLOTSAM MIGHT. OKAY. IT'S A MOVE TO ISSUE SIX. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE THIRTY FOUR OF YOUR HAND OUT. THE STATUS OF THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE TRIAL COURT CONSTRUCTION PROJECT IS THAT SIDE THAT CURRENT STATUS OF THE TRIAL COURT CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM IS THAT IT'S EFFECTIVELY ON HOLES. IN THIS IS REALLY DUE TO THREE KEY PROBLEMS THAT ARE LAID OUT ON THIS PAGE. THE FIRST ISSUE IS THAT THERE'S BEEN A CONTINUED DECLINE IN THE FINAL FEW REVENUE THAT THE FACT THAT ABSENT ANY CHANGES IN REVENUES EXPENDITURES IT'S LIKELY THAT THEY COUNT HAVE INSUFFICIENT REVENUE TO SUPPORT. EXISTING DEBT SERVICE FOR THE TWENTY SIX PROJECTS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN COMPLETED AND THIS MAY REQUIRE GENERAL FUND RESOURCES RANGING FROM NINETY TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS. AND FINALLY THERE'S NO LONG TERM PLAN FOR HOW WE'RE GONNA FIND. THE REMAINING A HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE PLANS PROJECTS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. THE NEXT TWO PAGES OF YOUR HAND OUT IS A CHART THAT WE JUST PROVIDE FOR YOUR REFERENCE AND IT'S THE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE PROJECTS CATEGORIZED BY COUNTY AS WELL AS THE FIVE PRIORITY NEED. PRIORITY NEED AREA US. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FORTY OF YOUR AGENDA. THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO SAU ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN LEASE REVENUE BONDS BACKED BY THE GENERAL FUND INSTEAD OF THE CONSTRUCTION ACCOUNTS AND THEY WOULD FUND THE TEN SPECIFIC PROJECTS BEFORE YOU ON THIS TABLE. SIX OF THESE PROJECTS ARE IMMEDIATE NEED PROJECTS AND FOUR OF THEM ARE CRITICAL NEED PROJECT. THE ESTIMATED DEBT SERVICE IS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWO MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS. THE SECOND PIECE OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL IS THIRTY TWO POINT TWO MILLION. FROM CONSTRUCTION ACCOUNTS FOR THREE OF THE PROJECTS ON THIS LIST COMPLETE PRECONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES. IF YOU TURN TO THE NEXT PAGE OF YOUR HAND OUT BOTH HOUSES APPROVED THE TOTAL FUNDING LEVEL. SENATE HOWEVER APPROVE THE SPECIFIC TEN PROJECTS WHILE THE ASSEMBLY DID NOT THE ASSEMBLY INSTEAD SPECIFIED THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD SELECT THE PROJECTS AFTER THE JUDICIAL BRANCH COMPLETED A REASSESSMENT OF THE IMMEDIATE. CRITICAL AND HIGH NEED PROJECTS AND IT ALSO INCLUDED SOME ADDITIONAL CRITERIA FOR PART OF THAT REASSESSMENT. THE SENATE ON THE OTHER HAND AS PART OF THEIR PACKAGE ADOPTED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE REQUIRING A REASSESSMENT OF ALL. OF THE PROJECTS AS WELL AS REQUIRING ON A LONG TERM PLAN CONDITION STATEMENT EVERY SINGLE TIME CAPITAL OUTLAY. REQUEST WAS SUBMITTED. IF YOU TURN TO THE NEXT PAGE OF YOUR HAND UP LEAD YOU OFFER A COMPROMISE FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THE COMPROMISE WOULD CONSIST OF PROVIDING THE FUNDING LEVELS AS PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION BY ADOPTING THE ASSEMBLIES APPROACH TO REQUIRE A REASSESSMENT OF THE IMMEDIATE CRITICAL HEINE PROJECTS BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE SELECTED THE PROJECTS. BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL ASSESSMENT WAS DONE ABOUT A DECADE AGO THIS WOULD HELP ENSURE THAT OF THE PROJECTS THAT WERE OF GREATEST NEED WERE IDENTIFIED IN FUNDED. THE PACKAGE WAS ALSO IN CRUDE INCLUDE APPROVING THE SENATE'S PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE RELATED TO LONG TERM FUND CONDITION STATEMENTS AS THAT WOULD HELP ENSURE THAT THEY'RE SUFFICIENT FUNDING AVAILABLE BEFORE ANY NEW PROJECTS MOVE FORWARD. AND THE FINAL PIECE WOULD BE A MODIFICATION OF THE SENATE'S TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE RELATED TO REASSESSMENT AND THAT WOULD FOCUS ON THE MEDIUM AND LOW PROJECTS BECAUSE ALL OF THE OTHER PROJECTS WOULD HAVE BEEN REASSESSED AS PART OF THE ASSEMBLIES. APPROACH. THANK YOU. AT THAT BY THINK GAS SENATOR MORLOCKS TWITCHING. TO GO HOME. SORT. WHAT ARE IN THIS COUNTRY? WELL I WAS LOOKING AT CITED THAT WE GET TO GO OF COURSE THAT ARE MORE LIKE JUST GETTING. IT'S A MISS. MISS MISS. LANGUAGES THAT ARE NOT THAT'S WHAT YOU TO GO HOME TO. SULKY TO BRIEF ON THAT NOTE MISTER CHAIR. WE SUPPORT THE SENATE VERSION OF THIS WE WOULD KNOW I I THINK YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THESE PROJECTS IN TWO DIFFERENT WAY CONTINUING PROJECT VERSES AN ACTIVE PROJECT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL REASSESS EACH OF THE TEN CONTINUING PROJECTS TO ENSURE THAT THEY STILL MEET. THE IMMEDIATE AND CRITICAL NEEDS CRITERIA BASED ON EACH COURT SECURITY INADEQUACIES OVERCROWDING PHYSICAL CONDITION ACCESS TO COURTS SERVICE SAYS. ON IF WE WERE TO ADOPT A THE ASSEMBLY ACTION IN WHOLE IT WOULD LEAD TO DELAYS THAT WE CALCULATE WOULD COST APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. DUE TO ESCALATION AND DESIGN DOCUMENT REVISIONS WE AGREE THAT A REASSESSMENT OF THE INACTIVE COURT CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS IS WARRANTED. ON BUT WE DON'T WANT TO DELAY THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE TEN ACTIVE PROJECTS GIVEN THAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL JUST REVIEWED THEM IN THE FALL WITH THAT HAPPY ANSWER ANY. THEY CAN DISCUSS. ETCETERA. THANK YOU MISTER JUST A QUICK QUESTION HAVE WE NOW REPAID ALL OF THE OTHER. JUDICIAL COUNCILS CONSTRUCTION FUNDS. CAN WE BORROW FROM THE CONSTRUCTION FUNDS. I THINK WE HAVE A WILL WILL BOTH NEED TO CHECK ON THAT. JUST CURIOUS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND TO WITH YOUR INDULGENCE I I'M GOING TO JUST ADD SOME VERY VERY QUICK COMMENTS ON BOTH ISSUES FIVE AND SIX RATHER THAN. SPREAD OUT BETWEEN THE TWO ITEMS SO I THOUGHT I'D DO IT ONCE. I WANT TO. AGREE VERY STRONGLY WITH THAT MR OBERNOLTE ASSESSMENT OF THE. IMPORTANCE OF FAIR TRIAL COURT FUNDING. I CAN'T UNDERSCORE THAT AN ENOUGH AND THAT'S THE. ASSEMBLIES APPOINTEE TO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. I'VE SAT THROUGH MANY OF THE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE. Y. FROM FORMULA AND I'M CONVINCED THAT IT IS. THE FAIREST DISTRIBUTION OF FOR OF A OF MONEY AND. RESOURCES TO THAT TO THE COURTS AND IT BY THE WAY WAS ADJUSTED AND I THINK IT WAS JANUARY OF. OF THIS YEAR SO IT'S KIND OF AN ONGOING PROCESS. WITH RESPECT TO THE. ASSEMBLIES DESIRE TO OF FUND COURT REPORTERS IN FAMILY LAW THIS IS A FAMILY LAW DEPARTMENTS. THIS IS ALSO SOMETHING I CAN SPEAK TO FROM EXPERIENCE HAVING. PRACTICE FAMILY LAW FOR NEARLY THIRTY FIVE YEARS THERE'S NO PLACE WHERE IT IS MORE IMPORTANT TO HAVE ACCURACY AND. IN A FAMILY COURT TO PROCEEDING WHERE FREQUENTLY LAWYERS CAN'T AGREE ON ANYTHING YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE TRANSCRIPT BUT. APPROXIMATELY A IN THIS ALONG CA A TERM ISSUE APPROXIMATELY FIFTY PERCENT. OF FULL OF FAMILY LAW LITIGANTS ARE UNREPRESENTED AND TO ASK THEM TO GO BACK AND AGREE ON WHAT WAS SAID IN A HEARING THAT MIGHT HAVE TO DO WITH A. A A CHILD CUSTODY ORDER TIMES DATES. IT GETS VERY VERY COMPLICATED ENDS. THAT ITSELF CAN LEAD TO FRICTION BETWEEN PARTIES AND WHEN THAT PLAYS OUT. WITH FAMILY SAID IT SO IT'S NOT PRETTY. AND AND FINALLY ON WITH RESPECT TO CORE CONSTRUCTION WITHOUT WEIGHING IN ON EITHER PLAN SOME OF THESE COURT HOUSES. ARE LITERALLY BEING HELD TOGETHER BY BAILING WIRE THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. IN OUR IN OUR COURTS IS ABOMINABLE AND WE REALLY NEED TO GET ON TOP OF IT. THANK YOU. OKAY. WE ARE WILL BE A JOURNEY. WE WILL BE RECONVENING WEDNESDAY. WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. UPON CALL OF THE CHAIR
