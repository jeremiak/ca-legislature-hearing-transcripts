MYSELF AND SENATOR STEVEN BRADFORD- THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL MEASURE THAT MUST BE PASSED BEFORE WE RECESS I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE MANY STAKEHOLDERS WHO CONTRIBUTED TO THIS BILL INCLUDING- THE NUMEROUS TENET ADVOCATES LABOR THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA RENTAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION THE BANKING COMMUNITIES- OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND OF COURSE THE CAUGHT MY COLLEAGUES IN BOTH HOUSES OF THE LEGISLATURE AS YOU ALL KNOW IN LESS THAN ONE WEEK THE CALIFORNIA JUDICIAL COUNCIL OF EMERGENCY RULE NUMBER ONE WILL BE RESCINDED AND TENANTS ACROSS THE STATE WILL BE AT RISK OF EVICTION FOR NON PAYMENT. OF RENT. WE MUST ACT NOW TO ESTABLISH NEW ADDICTION PROTECTION TONIGHT I KNOW THAT THIS COMMITTEE HEARD- THE IT MISTER CHOOSE. ORIGINAL BILL ON THIS- BUT WE NEED TO GET US THROUGH THE NEXT FIVE MONTHS TO PREVENT A WAVE OF MASS DEFECTIONS IN THE MIDDLE OF A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WITH NO CLEAR END IN SIGHT. AT THE SAME TIME THE UNPRECEDENTED JOB LOSSES FELT BY TENANTS HAVE LEFT MANY LANDLORDS STRUGGLING TO COVER THEIR COSTS THIS BURDEN IS ESPECIALLY HARD FOR SMALL MOM AND POP LANDLORDS WHO DEPEND ON RENTAL INCOME TO COVER THEIR LIVING EXPENSES. TO HANDLE THIS EMERGENCY WE NEED MEANINGFUL RENT RELIEF TO HELP MAKE LANDLORDS HOLD WHILE SHIELDING TENANTS FROM TAKING ON MOUNTAINS OF DEBT FROM THEY'RE MISSED PAYMENTS. THIS YEAR TWO BILLS MOVE THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE AB FOURTEEN THIRTY SIX WHAT YOU HEARD EARLIER AND SB FOURTEEN TEN. THE BILLS TOOK DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO SOLVE THIS COST CRISIS. AFTER HOURS OF CONVERSATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT REPRESENTS. A HYBRID OF THESE TWO BILLS TO KEEP RENDERS HOUSED AND LANDLORDS FROM FORECLOSURES. FOR TENANTS AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT SET UP TWO DIFFERENT PHASES. THE FIRST PHASE FOCUSES ON THE INITIAL PANDEMIC PERIOD MARCH THIRTEENTH THROUGH SEPTEMBER FIRST. AND PROVIDES IT A TENANT CANNOT BE EVICTED FOR RENT MISSED DURING THIS TIME. IT ALSO SETS UP A SITUATION WHERE PAST DUE RENT THAT IS STILL OWED TO THE LANDLORD IS CONVERTED TO A CONSUMER DEBT. AND CAN BE COLLECTED IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR LANDLORDS TO RECOVER WHAT THEY ARE OWED WITHOUT THE HIGH COST OF LITIGATION. AND WITHOUT CLOGGINGUP THE COURT SYSTEM. THE NEXT PHASE IS THE TRANSITION PERIOD FROM SEPTEMBER FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TO JANUARY THIRTY FOURTH FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY ONE. TO QUALIFY FOR PROTECTIONS DURING THIS PHASE TENANTS MUST ATTEST. THAT THEY EXPERIENCED A COVERT HARDSHIP BY SIGNING A DECLARATION UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY IT'S A FORM THAT WILL BE. UTILIZED BY BY EVERYONE. AND HIGHINCOME TENANTS MAKING AT LEAST A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR OR AT LEAST A HUNDRED AND 30% OF AM I MUST PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTED PROOF OF HARDSHIP. IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR THIS. THIS AT PROTECTION DURING THIS PERIOD OF TIME THE TENANT MUST ALSO. PAY AT LEAST 25% OF THE RENT OWED EACH MONTH DURING THIS PERIOD AND THE REST OF THE RENT- CANNOT BE THE BASIS FOR AN EVICTION. IN OTHER WORDS THEY'RE PROTECTED FROM EVICTION. AND THAT IS ALSO CONVERTED TO SYMBOL THAT. IF A TENANT IS UNABLE TO PAY 25% OF THE RENT DO THAT DUE TO THE- IN THE NOTE THAT THE NORMAL EVICTION PROCESSES MAY BEGIN FEBRUARY TWENTY FIRST SO IN ANY CASE. TENANTS ARE PROTECTED UNTIL FEBRUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE- AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO SET UP A SITUATION WHERE THERE'S AN INCENTIVE TO AT LEAST PAY 25% A YEAR RENT- AND- AND IF SO THAT THESE. LANDLORDS HAVE SOME CASH COMING IN AND- DURING THAT TIME OF. A DIFFICULT TIME SO EVICTIONS UNRELATED TO NON PAYMENT OF RENT. CAN BEGIN AGAIN ON SEPTEMBER SECOND TWENTY TWENTY. UNLESS THERE'S A LOCAL ORDINANCE IN PLACE. THAT PREVENTS IT. THIS ALSO PROTECTS THE AUTHORITY OF LOCAL EXISTING LOCAL ORDINANCES SO TENANTS IN JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE MORE PROTECTIVE LOCAL ORDINANCES CAN STILL RELY ON THOSE PROTECTIONS UNTIL THEY EXPIRE IN WHICH CASE THIS. ORDINANCE ARE THIS- BILL CONTROLS THE THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LANDLORD AND THE TENANT AND ANY EVICTIONS. FOR LANDLORDS THIS BILL EXPANDS THE HOMEOWNERS BILL OF RIGHTS ANTI FORECLOSURE PROTECTIONS TO SMALL LANDLORDS AND PUTS IN PLACE CONSUMER PROTECTION MEASURES. TO REQUIRE BANKS TO FOLLOW APPLICABLES FEDERAL GUIDELINES REGARDING BORROWER OPTIONS AFTER OFFERING COVE IN NINETEEN RELATED RELATED FORBEARANCE. AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT IT'S A TEMPORARY SOLUTION AND AFTER THIS BILL IS SIGNED OUR WORK CONTINUES TO PREPARE FOR THE NEW YEAR AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT REQUIRES THE ADMINISTRATION TO CONVENE A WORKING GROUP. WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO LOOK AT WAYS TO DIRECT FUTURE FEDERAL STIMULUS MONEY INTO RELIEF FOR TENANTS LANDLORDS AND HOMEOWNERS THERE THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER DIFFERENT SMALL LITTLE MOVING PARTS OF PROTECTIONS- I'M GOING TO THOSE IF YOU REALLY WOULD LIKE ME TO BUT SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT OUR GOAL HERE. WAS TO PROTECT TENANTS SO THEY WOULD NOT GET EVICTED. AND TO- ENCOURAGED THE BANKS AND TO GET THEM INVOLVED IN MAKING SURE THAT THEY DON'T FOR CLOSE ON- PROPERTIES THAT- AT OWN PROPERTIES PERIOD BECAUSE ONCE THEY START FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS AND TENANTS LOSE LOSE IT CIGNA. PART TO SO DO. SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL TODAYAND TO ASSIST WITH TECHNICAL QUESTIONS IS BRIAN A GUSTO ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION AND THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. AND DEBRA CARLTON ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT pCABALLERO. AT THIS POINT IN TIME LET'S GO TO THE PHONES WE ARE. GOING TO ALLOW OUR MAIN WITNESSES A TOTAL OF FOUR MINUTES ON EACH SIDE. I AM ALSO ADVISED THAT WE HAVE A COUPLE WITNESSES WHO ARE GOING TO SPEAK. IN STRONG NEUTRALITY. AS WELL WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THEM THIRTY SECONDS EACH ON.

AND WILL GIVE THEM EACH THIRTY SECONDS BUT MEANWHILE NOW WE WILL START- WITH- OUR KEY WITNESSES WE HAVE THOSE. TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT R. BRIAN A GUSTO. WITH THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION- AND OUR SECOND WITNESS IS DEBRA CARLTON FROM THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION. MISTER MODERATORS THAT CORRECT. MODERATORS WOULD YOU CONFIRM THAT WE HAVE BRIAN AUGUSTA AND DEBRA CARLTON ON THE LINE AS OUR MAIN WITNESSES. THEY'RE BOTH ON THE LINE AND THEIR LINES ARE OPEN I THANK YOU MADAM THE MODERATOR MY APOLOGIES ALL RIGHT SO BRIAN AUGUSTA WITH THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION AND- I LEFT OUT.

A YOU AND MISS CARLTON HAVE A TOTAL OF FOUR MINUTES PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS BRIAN AUGUSTA. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION AND WHAT'S YOUR CENTER AND YOUR MENTIONED ANYTHING USUAL TIMES SORT OF UNUSUAL POSITIONS WE CERTAINLY WANT TO SEE THIS. BILL MOVE FORWARD BUT AS MY COMMENTS WILL SUGGEST. WE DO NOT SEE THIS BILL AS THE SOLUTION AND WE HAVE A LOT MORE WORK TO DO. JUDGE THIS COVER NINETEEN CRISIS BEGAN WESTERN CENTER AND GENERALLY FOUNDATION ALONG WITH. MANY MANY OTHER GROUPS HAVE BEEN SOUNDING THE ALARM ABOUT THE WAVE OF MASS EVICTION BUT- LIKELY TO. FROM SUDDEN SHUTDOWN OF OUR ECONOMY AND IMPACTING THE ABILITY OF MILLIONS OF JAPANESE TO PAY THE RENT THAT'S WHY WE'RE- RAVENOUS DISCUSSION TODAY AND- WE'VE ALSO WARNED ABOUT THE DIRE CONSEQUENCES OF ALLOWING. ANY OF ACTIONS TO PROCEED DURING A PANDEMIC WHEN THE STATE OF URGE PEOPLE TO STAY HOME IN ORDER TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND- STOP THE SPREAD OF THIS DEADLY DISEASE AND THAT. THE PRIMARY THING THAT IS HELD BACK SINCE WAVERED ACTIONS. BY THE PAUSE ON FIXING CASES THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE BY. THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL EMERGENCY RULE ONE. AND IT ALL OF YOU KNOW THAT RULE WILL BE REVEALED ON TUESDAY. TODAY'S SATURDAY. L. BEFORE YOU PROVIDES SOME PROTECTION FOR TENANTS WHO DO HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE. TO BE UNABLE TO PAY THE RENT. IT NEEDS TO PASS. BUT IT'S NOT NEARLY ENOUGH THIS IS NOT. A COMPLETE SOLUTION TO A LOOMING EVICTION CRISIS NOR IS IT A LONG TERM SOLUTION WE NEED TO THE VERY REAL FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC IS HAVING A TENANTS. SMALL LANDLORDS. IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROVIDERS. MANY TENANTS WILL BE UNPROTECTED ONCE RULE ONE IS REPEALED ON TUESDAY. MOST AMERICANS OTHER THAN THOSE FOR NONPAYMENT CAN MOVE FOR THE VERY NEXT DAY. SO THOSE MOST LIKELY TO BE IMPACTED BY THIS OUR LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AND DISPROPORTIONATELY BLACK AND BROWN RENTERS THE VERY PEOPLE WHO ARE ALSO DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY THE CODE CRISIS. THE LAW TO RULE ONE MUST BE ADDRESSED IF WE ARE TO AVOID A CATASTROPHE. OUR FIRM POSITION THAT WE CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE THAT WE CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE TO. CONTAIN THE COAT TO COVER NINETEEN ALLOWING ANY OF ACTIONS OTHER THAN THOSE NECESSARY FOR PUBLIC SAFETY DANGEROUS AND CONTRARY TO PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTOR SO WELL WHAT YOU VOTE TO MOVE THIS FORWARD THE GROUP. THE PROPOSAL IS REPORTED TODAY. WE WHICH WE URGE YOU TO DO. WE WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT OUR COLLECTIVE WORK IS NOT DONE ON THIS ISSUE THANK YOU A LOT MORE THANK YOU MISTER GASTON APPRECIATED. OUR NEXT WITNESSES DEBRA CARLTON WHO HAS A MINUTE AND FORTY SECONDS. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR DEBRA CARLTON THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION- WELL APARTMENT IS OUR IN OUR NAME I WANT TO SAY THAT- 75% OF OUR MEMBERS. OWN LESS THAN TEN UNITS IT'S BEEN A VERY BIG STRUGGLE FOR US AS WE WORK THROUGH THE PROVISIONS OF THE SPELL. AND WHILE YOU'VE HEARD OPPOSITION ON PREVIOUS COVER NINETEEN BILLS IT'S ALWAYS BEEN OUR POSITION BUT SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE TO PROVIDE HELP FOR TENANTS. WHO ARE TRULY AFFECTED BY COBIT NINETEEN AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE COMPENSATION FOR LANDLORDS ESPECIALLY MOM AND POP OWNERS AT RISK OF FORECLOSURE. OR THOSE WHO ARE RETIRED AND DEPEND ON THIS INCOME BUT THEY HAVE NOT RECEIVED BY WAY OF RENT PER MONTH. SO THE BOTH TO HAVE A CAME TOGETHER TO PROVIDE INPUT ON AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT AND MET. IT'S NOT THE PERFECT SOLUTION EVERYONE INVOLVED WOULD HAVE WANTED MUCH MORE FOR THEIR MEMBERS AND THEIR CONSTITUENTS. WE ALL KNOW THAT TO TRULY ADDRESS THE CRISIS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO STEP UP. COBIT IMPACT RENTERS NEED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE SO THAT THEY CAN PAY THEIR RENT. IF RENT CONTINUES O GO UNPAID HELPING PROVIDERS WILL EITHER FACE FORECLOSURE OR IF THEY CAN HANDLE SELLER CONVERT THEIR PROPERTIES. THAT MAY MEAN TENANTS WILL LOSE THEIR HOMES IN THE END AND THE SMALLER PROPERTIES HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND LOSING THESE UNITS WOULD WORSEN CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING SHORTAGE. AS A BUYING TO GET THAT THAT OUR WORK IS NOT DONE AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT IS A TEMPORARY SOLUTION AND WE COMMIT TO WORK ON. FINDING BETTER SOLUTIONS GOING FORWARD. OWNERS AND TENANTS ALIKE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU MISS CARLTON APPRECIATE THAT. ALL RIGHT AT THIS TIME WE WILL.

WHAT WE DO NOT HAVE A FORMAL POSITION WE WOULD BE REMISS IF WE DID NOT EXPRESS OUR CONCERNS ABOUT MY NOT LETTER SUBMITTED TO THE COMMITTEE YESTERDAY MAINLY ONLY REQUIRING TENANTS TO PAY TWENTY FIVE. PERCENT OF THE RENT DUE FROM SEPTEMBER ON BY THE END OF THIS COMING JANUARY IS REALLY TOUGH FOR MEMBERS AND BURDEN PROPERTY OWNERS WITH THE COST HOW WITHOUT MUCH RELIEF WHILE WE RECOGNIZE THE MORTGAGE FORBEARANCE. WE WOULD POINT OUT THAT IT IS LIMITED HAVING SAID THAT WE APPRECIATE THE ENGAGEMENT AND NEGOTIATION WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE LEGISLATURE INCLUSION OF DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS MEANS TESTING PREEMPTION AND THE DIRECTIVE TO WORK AROUND THE SYSTEM. THANK REWARDED FOR THE COLLABORATION NEXT YEAR THANK YOU SO MUCH IN COMMON APPRECIATE. IT NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. KARIMABAD SHE. GOOD MORNING SURE JACKSON MEMBERS OR GOOD AFTERNOON RATHER- CREAM GREASY WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS WANNSEE OURS NEUTRAL MAYBE THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT WE WISH TO EXPRESS CONCERN THAT THE LEGISLATION DOES NOT SUFFICIENTLY ADDRESS THE SEVERE IMPACTS OF THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC ON SMALL MOM AND POP HOUSING PROVIDERS THIS YEAR LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE THE ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS DURING THE INTERIM ON PROPOSAL THAT INCLUDED DRESSING PUT THE PLIGHT. FACING SMALL HOUSING PROVIDER DUE TO THE COLD NINETEEN PANDEMIC THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT WITH THAT WE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DIETS I JUST WANNA MAKE A FEW COMMENTS WE HAD A HEARING LAST WEEK. ON THIS IT TOOK ABOUT SIX HOURS. AND CLEAR THE BILL THAT WAS PRESENTED TO US THEN. IT WAS A MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND SUBSTANTIAL IN BROADER BILL. BECAUSE THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT THE PENSION TRUST AFFECT TENANTS DOESN'T TRUST AFFECT LANDLORDS. IT DOESN'T JUST AFFECT HOMEOWNERS IT AFFECTS THEM ALL TOGETHER. AND WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US TODAY IS CLEARLY A VERY WATERED DOWN VERSION OF THAT EFFORT I LOOK AT THIS IS A THREE LEGGED STOOL YOU CAN'T ADDRESS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITHOUT ADDRESSING THE OTHER TWO FACETS OF IT. AND THOSE OTHER TWO FACETS ARE NUMBER ONE THE TENANTS RIGHT NOW ARE HURTING BECAUSE OF COLD IT. AND HAD WE HAD LEGITIMATE AND ROBUST LEADERSHIP ON A NATIONAL BASIS I DO NOT BELIEVE WE WOULD BE WHERE WE ARE TODAY. BUT THAT BEING SAID WE ARE HERE AND WE ARE HAVING TO PICK UP THE PIECES OF A DISASTROUS FEDERAL POLICY ON THIS ISSUE LET'S MAKE LET'S LET LET'S LET'S BE HONEST ABOUT IT. SO HERE WE ARE PEOPLE ARRIVE TO WORK PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING. THE A JUDICIAL COUNCIL. EXTENDED A MORATORIUM BUT THAT HAS NOW ENDED IT IS ON US IT IS OUR JOB NOW TO STEP FORWARD AND PASS LEGISLATION. AND IDEA- FELT SO STRONGLY ABOUT WHAT WE WERE DOING LAST WEEK THAT I ACTUALLY- IT BECAME A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR THE BILL WORKED VERY HARD WITH THE- THE AUTHORS- IN HOPES THAT WE COULD ADDRESS. THE REALITIES OF THIS IS A THREE LEGGED STOOL. AND SOME OF THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS OUR OUR MORTGAGE HOLDERS ARE BANKS THEY DO NOT WANT TO PARTICIPATE. AND BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL ISSUES FEDERAL PREEMPTION THIS BILL DOESN'T REALLY ADDRESS THAT THIRD LEG OF THE STOOL IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY. SO HERE WE ARE TRYING TO BALANCE A THREE LEGGED STOOL ON TO LEX. WE HAVE TENANTS WHO ARE ABOUT TO GET EVICTED. YOU KNOW IF YOU DON'T HAVE SECURITY IN YOUR HOME YOU WERE VERY LITTLE. PEOPLE NEED TO BE SECURE IN WHERE THEY LIVE FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR THEIR CHILDREN. AND LANDLORDS PARTICULARLY SMALL ONES WHO ARE FREQUENTLY OPERATE ON THE BASIS OF THE MONEY THAT COMES INTO THEM TO PAY RENT SO THEY CAN PAY THE MORTGAGE AND THE UTILITIES AND OTHER EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ALSO NEED TO BE ABLE TO PAY THE MORTGAGE. SO THEY NEED SOME FORBEARANCE. BY THE BANKS. AND THE BANKS ARE WILLING TO PLAY BALL IN IT THEY ARE IN A VERY LIMITED WAY. AND YOU KNOW WHAT. WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. BY A WAY FOR CALLING UPON THE LANDLORDS TO FORBEAR. AND TO GET GVE THESE TENETS OF BREAKING ASKED TENANTS TO PAY. AT LEAST 25% THAT SEEMS LIKE A FAIR THING TO DO AND DO ALL THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE TO PROTECT THE SMALL LANDLORDS IN TERMS OF THE TENANT AND TO PROTECT THE TENANTS. THAT THE BANKS AND THE MORTGAGE HOLDERS ARE TO NOTHING. AND I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW DISAPPOINTED I AM THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN WILLING TO STEP UP- WORKERS HAVE SACRIFICED BECAUSE OF THIS- SO MANY NEW. LOW INCOME PEOPLE OF COLOR HAVE LITERALLY PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE. TO PROVIDE THOSE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS OF OUR SOCIETY. DURING THIS TIME AND HAVE SUFFERED COMMENSURATELY WITH FAT AND MANY OF THEM ARE THE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE A SAVINGS ACCOUNT SO THAT THEY CAN RIDE THROUGH THIS AND PAY THE RENT. BUT THEY ARE EQUALLY IS ENTITLED TO HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE AS ANYONE ELSE. NOW YOU KNOW WE ARE ASKING LANDLORDS TO MAKE SOME SACRIFICES AND WE'VE HEARD I'M SURE FOR MANY OF THEM WHO HAVEN'T BEEN PAID RENTED MANY MONTHS. AND ARE STRUGGLING THEMSELVES AND THAT IS TRUE. OUR AND TOUGH THEY ARE SHOULDERING THEIR SHARE OF THE BURDEN AND WE ARE ASKING THEM TO DO MORE. WITH THIS BILL. I BOUGHT. SOME LANDLORDS HAVE FALLEN BEHIND AND OR WILL FALL BEHIND WHAT THEY OWE TO THE BANKS AND SO THAT'S WHY AB FOURTEEN THIRTY SIX- CALLED UPON THE BANKS TO DO THEIR FAIR SHARE AS WELL. BANKS LIKE JP MORGAN CITI BANK BANK OF AMERICA WELLS FARGO JUST TO NAME A FEW THE VERY BANKS THAT WE COLLECTIVELY AS TAXPAYERS BAILED OUT OF THEIR MASS JUST A DECADE AGO. HAVE NOT STEPPED UP. NOW AT. TRYING NOT TO GET TOO ANGRY ABOUT THIS. BUT THE FACT IS WE HAVE PEOPLE IN SUPPORT BECAUSE THEY'RE DESPERATE TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES WHERE PEOPLE IN OPPOSITION BECAUSE THIS IS UNFAIR TO THEM AS WELL. AND YET THIS IS THE BEST WE CAN DO IN THIS SITUATION AND I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT THAT'S BEEN UNDERTAKEN APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT- THE AUTHORS SHOULD HAVE DONE AND THEIR STAFFS IN THIS. AND APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT. WE HAVE LIMITATIONS BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE LAWS ARE WRITTEN- THIS BILL PASSED SO VERY LITTLE OF THE BANKS AND THEREFORE PROVIDES SUCH COLD COMFORT. TO THE SMALL LANDLORDS AND HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE DOING THEIR PART AND LET'S BE HONEST EXTENSION OF THE HOMEOWNERS BILL OF RIGHTS CONTAINED IN THIS BILL WAS ALREADY MOVING THROUGH THIS LEGISLATURE ON CONSENT. AND THEN THE SO CALLED FORBEARANCE PIECE OF THIS BILL WAS WRITTEN BY THE BANKS. FOR BY THEM AND FOR THEM. IT OFFERS NOTHING OF SUBSTANCE TO BORROWERS. THERE IS NO THIRD LEG ON THE STOOL IT ALLOWS BANKS TO DENY DISTRESSED BORROWERS FORBEARANCE FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER WITH NEARLY ABSOLUTE IMPUNITY. EVEN THE CREDIT UNIONS AND SMALL COMMUNITY LENDERS WHO JUSTIFIABLY SOUGHT AN EXEMPTION FROM THE MORE ONEROUS REQUIREMENTS OF AB AT FOURTEEN THIRTY SIX ARGUABLY. ARE PERFECTLY CONTENT TO BE A PART OF THIS BILL BECAUSE IT ASKED NEXT TO NOTHING OF THEM AS WELL. SEVERAL OF OUR SISTER STATES HOWEVER OREGON NEW YORK MASSACHUSETTS HAVE PASSED SOME KIND OF MORATORIUM ON FORECLOSURE. CALIFORNIA SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST OR AT LEAST REFUSE TO GIVE BANKS READY ACCESS TO THE BENEFITS OF OUR NON JUDICIAL FORECLOSURE PROCESS IF THEY REFUSE TO OFFER OUR BORROWERS FORBEARANCE. SO LET ME LET ME ADD FOR CLARITY I DO NOT BLAME. ANYONE ANY OF OUR AUTHORS HERE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU FOUGHT HARD FORD ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIMON OF COURSE HAD FOUGHT HARD TO REQUIRE THE BANKS TO TAKE SOME RESPONSIBILITY. WHAT ARE THE BANKS. THE BANKS HAVE A LOT OF POWER THE BANKS SEEM TO BE HISTORICALLY ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH DOING JUST ABOUT ANYTHING TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE. AND ARGUABLY OF THIS NATION AND YET WE JUST WE JUST TAXPAYERS CONSISTENTLY A BAIL THEM OUT. SO WE'RE KIND OF LEFT IT WITH A HOBSON'S CHOICE I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY BECAUSE OTHERWISE IN A FEW DAYS PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE OUT ON THE STREET. NOT BECAUSE I KNOW JUST JUST REALLY WANT TO DO THAT. BUT MANY OF THEM HAVE NO CHOICE EITHER. AND SO THE BURDEN OR THE RESPONSIBILITY I SHOULD SAY. TO MAKE THIS WORK FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA LARGE WITH THE BANKS WERE WILLING TO DO NOTHING. AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT BACK NEXT THAT NEXT YEAR IN JANUARY WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME CLEARLY HERE. I WON'T BE HERE BUT I KNOW MANY OF YOU WILL AND I HOPE THAT YOU TAKE UP THIS THIS MANTLE THAT YOU FIGHT HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE. DOES THEIR FAIR SHARE SURE HERE AND JOB THAT WE AT THAT POINT IN TIME- WILL HAVE TO CONFRONT THIS ISSUE BECAUSE AS YOU SAY THIS GOES ONLY THROUGH THE END OF JANUARY AND THEN THEY'LL BE MORE PAIN. AND MORE HOMELESSNESS AND MORE ANGST AND MORE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE FOR THEIR CHILDREN AS A GROUP AND SAY TRY TO FIND A WAY TO PAY THE RENT THE BACKGROUND THAT THEY ALSO. HAD TO PAY THE OTHER EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH LIVING THROUGH THIS DISASTROUS PANDEMIC THE DIDN'T HAVE TO BE. SO I HOPE THAT TO THE NEXT YEAR YOU WILL REMEMBER THIS BILL REMEMBER WHO STEPPED UP TO DO THEIR PART. AND WHO DID NOT AND THEN FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES LET US NOT LET THE BANKS GET AWAY WITH THIS AGAIN. AND WITHOUT BOB I NOTED TO SENATOR BORCHERS YOU HAVE YOUR HAND UP PHOTO BY SENATOR MONNING. AND SENATOR US SENATOR BOARD JUST GOOD AFTERNOON SIR THANK YOU MANAGER. THIS IS CERTAINLY A DIFFERENT FORMAT- THERE WHAT WE WENT THROUGH DURING THAT SIX HOUR ORDEAL LAST WEEK- THERE I THINK THEY HAVE BEEN SOME. RECOGNIZABLE IMPROVEMENTS. AS I WENT THROUGH THIS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT I'VE HAD IS I JUST GOT THIS PROBABLY JUST LIKE THE REST OF YOU I JUST GOT THE BILL I JUST GOT THE ROUGH OVERVIEW AND SOME OF THE ANALYSIS SO LITERALLY. I DON'T HAVE A LOT TO GO ON. AND THAT MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE AS A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE PEOPLE RELY ON US BEING FULLY BRIEFED AND AWARE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PROVISIONS IN A PIECE OF LEGISLATION. SO BUT LET ME MENTION A COUPLE THINGS I THINK ARE IMPROVEMENTS ONE I THINK THE PENALTY OF PERJURY THAT WAS SOMETHING I ADVOCATED FOR. LAST WEEK- WITH THE INITIAL DRAFT IT HAD DID NOT. PROVIDE THAT LEVEL OF PROTECTION- THE SHORTENED TIMELINE I THINK IS BETTER JANUARY TWENTY ONE AS OPPOSED TO WHAT WAS BEFORE THE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. OF RENTS- I THINK IS CERTAINLY HELPFUL. STANDS UP MAKING CERTAIN THAT THE EXISTING LANDLORD TENANT RIGHTS- THAT WOULD NORMALLY ALLOW A LANDLORD TO REVIEW. HOW WELL AS A- A RENTER'S PERFORMING IN THE COMPLEX IN OTHER BREAKING IN THE OTHER UNRELATED TO COPE AND FINANCIAL ISSUES RULES STILL GIVES THEM AND ALLOWS THEM THE POWER TO- MOVE ON INTERDICTION AS APPROPRIATE. ALBOM'S THAT I SEE RIGHT NOW IT IS. ONE I THINK CALIFORNIA'S STILL IT CANNOT DICTATE TO THE BANKS. WHAT THEY EXPECT THE BANKS TO PERFORM AND I THINK THE CHAIRWOMAN WENT INTO SOME DETAIL ON- HOW THE BANKS ARE NOT UNDER ANY TYPE OF OBLIGATION CURRENTLY AND I'M REPRESENTS ELEVEN COUNTIES ALL OR PARTS OF ELEVEN COUNTIES AND WIENER REPRESENT A LOT OF FOLKS. WHO HAVE SMALL FOR AN UNDER UNIT COMPLEXES THEY'RE GETTING HIT JUST LIKE THE RANGERS ARE GETTING IT THEY'RE GETTING AT SO THIS REALLY IS A BALANCING ACT. AND I THINK ONE THING THAT IS TERRIBLY DISCONCERTING IS WE HAVE NOT DEVISED. THROUGH NEGOTIATION OF WAR THROUGH LEGISLATION AWAY THAT CALIFORNIA STEPS UP. AND OFFERS SOME SUPPORT TO THE BORROWER THE OWNER OF THE COMPLEX- FOR EXAMPLE WHY ISN'T THERE A STATE TAX CREDIT THAT WAS PART OF THIS THAT WOULD SOFTEN THE BLOW TO FOLKS THAT ARE WITHOUT. RECEIVING RENTS WHY IS THERE NOT A STATE FUNDS ARE CREATED THAT COULD BE OF ASSISTANCE NOT UNLIKE THE ONES THAT WE HAVE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. SO. BY ALLOWING THIS TO MOVE FORWARD. WE'RE GOING TO BE HELPING BUT ALSO HURTING THE INDUSTRY I THINK LONG TERM ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK IS OF IT SHOULD BE OF CONCERN IS WHAT IS THIS GOING TO DO TO LIQUIDITY AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL MOVING FORWARD. BECAUSE THE BORROWERS. IT WAS A RISK THEN LENDERS ARE GOING TO PROBABLY STEP IN THE CRITERIA THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM ACCESS TO CAPITAL SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INCREASING- THE VOLUME OF HOMES THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH OUR HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE SATISFYING A SHORT TERM PROBLEM BUT POTENTIALLY CREATING AN INTERMEDIATE AND LONG TERM LIQUIDITY AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL PROBLEM. I DON'T THINK I'M STATING THINGS THAT PEOPLE HAVE. NOT WRESTLED WITH BECAUSE THIS IS AN IMPERFECT SITUATION AND IT'S- UNDER THE GUN- WE ONLY HAVE A DAY AND A HALF OR OR ROUGHLY TWO DAYS LEFT IN THE LEGISLATURE. THE PROTECTIONS THAT WERE IN PLACE ARE SET TO EXPIRE SO WE DON'T DO SOMETHING. THAT BAD THINGS WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY HAPPEN. BUT MANAGER I'D LIKE TO IF I MAY OPPOSE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND I DON'T KNOW TO WHOM THEY SHOULD BE. ARE DIRECTED. MAYBE TO- THE FLOOR MANAGER OF FOR THIS BILL. MR CENTER BORCHERS SHE'S ALSO A I THINK ONE OF THE AUTHORS OF THE BILL SO I'M SURE SHE'S MORE THAN HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE AND SHE IS INDEED THE PERSON TO THE DIRECTOR QUESTIONS TO. ALL RIGHT. SO MY FIRST QUESTION IS. GIVEN THAT WE HAVE STRONG AND PRIVATE CONTRACT RIGHTS. YOUR OF OUR AMERICAN- SYSTEM. CAN YOU IMAGINE A SCENARIO WHERE A PARTY LET'S SEE A RENTER AND A LANDLORD LET'S ASSUME THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST NOW GOING INTO. A RENTAL AGREEMENT THAT THEY CAN CONTRACT AROUND THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION ALMOST AS IF YOU'RE STE YOU'RE WAVING LEGAL RIGHTS AS YOU WOULD IN ANY OTHER TYPE OF CONTRACTUAL ON NEGOTIATION IS THAT POSSIBLE SENATOR A COUPLE HERE- WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND AS A LAWYER I'M SURE YOU KNOW WHAT THE ANSWERS TO THAT QUESTION HAPPY TO DO IT- LET ME JUST SAY THAT- WE DO LIVE IN A IN A IN A SOCIETY THAT BELIEVES. VERY STRONGLY IN. IN CONTRACTS AND UPLOADING THOSE CONTRACTS BUT BY THE SAME TOKEN- THE STATE LEGISLATURE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE CHANGES TO STATE LAW THAT- THAT ARE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN IN THIS INSTANCE WHAT WE CONTROL IS HOW YOU CAN GET SOMEBODY OR HOW YOU CAN USE THE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE. WHICH IS THE SHERIFF TO BE ABLE TO- EVICT SOMEBODY IT TO THE COURTS AND THE SHERIFF AND SO IN THIS INSTANCE IT WOULD BE AGAINST PUBLIC POLICY TO ALLOW LANDLORDS. TO CREATE A CONTRACT THAT SAYS WE'RE GOING TO GO WE'RE GOING TO GO OUTSIDE OF THE LAW AND I GET TO A BIG DO IF I WANT TO- UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES SO. IT WOULD IT'S MY OPINION THAT YOU CANNOT. ENTER INTO A CONTRACT THAT CONTRAVENES A LAW IS TO ME THAT THIS PASSES AND IS SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR- THAT IS SET UP TO BE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST TO PROTECT LANDLORDS AND TENANT IT TELLS THEM WHAT THEIR RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES ARE. AND I ALSO THINK IF I MAY JUST ADD TO THAT THE FACT IS THAT WE'RE NUMBER AN EMERGENCY SITUATION AND THAT DOES GIVE US A MUCH BROADER POWERS AS WELL. FOR THE PUBLIC SAFETY AND WELL BEING AND CERTAINLY IF THERE IS A- A TO TERMINATE OR I BELIEVE. THAT THE RIGHT OF CONTRACT HAS BEEN UNDULY IT IMPROPERLY INTERFERED WITH. WE HAVE A COURT SYSTEM THAT WILL RESOLVE THAT ISSUE- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS CENTER BORCHERS. YES DOES- I WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS RELATES TO TWO MORE RESTRICTIVE OR MORE ONEROUS LOCAL ORDINANCES. SO DID I HEAR YOU SAY THAT THIS BECOMES THE DOMINANT BODY OF LAW. THAT OVERRIDES MORE RESTRICTIVE LOCAL ORDINANCES. I THINK I'D HAVE TO ASK WHAT YOU MEAN BY RESTRICTIVE ORDINANCES I'D MENTIONED. IF YOU HAVE A LOCAL I'D SAY MUNICIPALITY OR COUNTY WITH WHICHEVER ENTITY HAD THE LAND USE AUTHORITY- CREATED CREATED A ROLE THAT THAT SAYS. THAT SAYS THAT. YOU CAN. DISALLOW. THE NORMAL OPPORTUNITIES TO EVICT A PARTY FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW IF SOMEONE'S MAKES A LOT OF NOISE OR HAS TOO MANY PEOPLE AT THE PLACE WHERE THEY PARK THEIR VEHICLES INAPPROPRIATELY IN THE NORMAL- ARE OTHER EXAMPLES THAT ALLOW INDIVIDUALS TO BE EVICTED THAT THIS LEGISLATION STILL ACKNOWLEDGES AS- ADEQUATE AND ARE FORESEEABLE GROUNDS TO MAINTAIN THE EVICTION POWERS. WHAT IF THE LOWER- LOWER MUNICIPALITY HAS RESTRICTIONS AGAINST THAT SO DURING CONFLICT WHICH ONE WOULD CONTROL SO I KNOW THAT THERE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ENTITIES THAT HAVE PASSED ORDINANCES TO PROTECT TENANTS. AND THOSE PROTECTIONS WOULD STAY IN PLACE I TELL AND THEY'RE SET TO EXPIRE ON ON A NATURAL DATE MOST OF THEM HAVE A DATE. IN WHICH CASE STATE LAW THIS LAW WOULD CONTROL WHEN WE SET IT UP THAT WAY BECAUSE WE WANT TENANTS TO KNOW THEY'VE ARE THEY ALREADY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN THEIR LOCAL JURISDICTION WE WANT THEM TO CONTINUE TO BE PROTECTED. AND THEN ONCE THEY EXPIRE THIS PARTICULAR LAW KICKS IN. SO IN OTHER WORDS THIS IS. THE OTHER LAW OR THIS LAW RATHER IT IS SORT OF LIKE THE FLOOR THAT'S CORRECT OKAY YEAH. OKAY LAST QUESTION. FOR YOU DONE. ALL IN HERE. I'M STILL POURING OVER THIS BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME REALLY GOOD WORK. ON THIS ISSUE I WANT TO SPEND MORE TIME MAKING CERTAIN THAT I CAN FOLLOW UP WITH FOLKS WHO HAVE INSIGHTS INTO THE INDUSTRY AS WELL AS THOSE THAT WILL BE IMPACTED. I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY- BUT I WANTED FOLKS JUST. TO IT'S WONDERFUL TO KNOW THAT I'M GONNA BE DOING AS MUCH DUE DILIGENCE AS POSSIBLE OVER THE NEXT DAY OR SO WHENEVER THIS COMES TO. A LOT OF THE FLOOR THE FIGURE OUT IF THIS IS AS WELL THOUGHT OUT AND AS AS WE NEED FOR OUR FOR OUR COMMUNITY. BECAUSE WHAT I DON'T WANT TO SEE HAPPEN IS THAT THIS GOES TO JANUARY TWENTY ONE. IT COMES BACK IT IS AS AN EMERGENCY ITEM TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT SAYS WE NEED SIX MORE MONTHS OF THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH- FINANCIAL- STABILITY IN THE MARKET. IN THAT WOULD FOR ME I WOULD WOULD BE ON IT UNACCEPTABLE IN THE SOME ON THIS SIDE. BUT I THINK IT HAS MERITS IN IT BUT IT DOES ITS BEST TO BALANCE OUT THE NEEDS BETWEEN THE LANDLORD THE TENANT FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. THANK YOU SENATOR BORDER SO I JUST WANT TO COMMENT THE NOTION OF CALIFORNIA CREATING A FUND. WHEN WE ARE SUFFERING A BUDGET SHORTFALL AS A RESULT. OF THIS COVERT PANDEMIC. AND THE FACT THAT BECAUSE INACTION TOOK PLACE WHERE THERE WAS INACTION ON THE- FEDERAL LEVEL. RESULTING IN OUR HAVING TO LITERALLY SHUT THE STATE DOWN FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AND STILL CRAWLING BACK ON OUR KNEES TO TRY TO GET REOPENED. BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF ANY CLEAR CUT POLICIES- IT IS. HEART WERE HARD PRESSED TO BE ABLE TO START SETTING UP THESE FUNDS. BANKS ARE MUCH BETTER EQUIPPED TO DO IT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO IS THE MOST. EFFECTIVE AT DOING THAT BECAUSE THEY CAN PRINT MONEY. AND WE CAN'T OUR REQUIREMENT IS A BALANCED BUDGET- IN LET'S HOPE THAT PERHAPS. WE CAN GET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE THAT FUNDING THAT TO YOU BELIEVE IS APPROPRIATE- PERHAPS IT IS APPROPRIATE. AND THAT'S CERTAINLY APPROPRIATE THAT THE BANKS ALSO TAKE PART IN THIS. WHOLE PROCESS AS WELL BUT WITH THAT. US SENATOR MONNING FORESHORES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WANT TO JOIN IN THANKING THE AUTHORS SENATOR CAFIERO ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO IN THE ADMINISTRATION AND I KNOW IT'S ALSO BEEN INVOLVED IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS IN YOUR COMMITTEE. MADAM CHAIR. THIS IS AN IMPERFECT SOLUTION TO AN UNPRECEDENTED CRISIS IT'S A STOP GAP MEASURE TO RECOGNIZE THAT IN TWO DAYS. MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE GONNA FACE ARE GONNA LOSE THE PROTECTION EXTENDED BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL IT'S DESIGNED TO PROVIDE. SOME PREDICTABILITY IN PROTECTION MOVING FORWARD- BUT THE OTHER CHALLENGE HERE IS WE DON'T HAVE A PREDICTABLE. END TO THE COVERT NINETEN CRISIS A LOT OF THESE FOLKS WHO NEED RELIEF. BE THEY A TENANT BE THEIR PROPERTY OWNER WHO STRUGGLING TO MAKE PAYMENTS HAVE LOST JOBS. HAVE LOST LOVED ONES. AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE WITHOUT WORK THERE'S NOTHING. MAGIC THAT HAPPENED SEPTEMBER FIRST JUST THIRTY FIRST OR FEBRUARY OF NEXT YEAR THE GUARANTEES OUR ECONOMY IS RESTORED IN COVERT NINETEEN IS BEHIND US DESPITE PROCLAMATIONS FROM CERTAIN ACTORS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THE COVERT NINETEEN IS BEHIND THIS. WE'RE APPROACHING TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DEATHS NATIONALLY THE PROJECTION IS THAT WE WILL CERTAINLY HIT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DEATHS AND THERE ARE SOME WHO SEEK TO IGNORE THAT REALITY. BUT THAT REALITIES BEING FELT THANK EVERYONE IN THIS STATE SO I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTIVE OFTHIS TODAY BUT I STILL I'VE HEARD FROM JUDGES IN MY DISTRICT WHO WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE THEY FEAR THEY'RE GOING TO BE FLOODED WITH THE VACATION- LITIGATION. STARTING SEPTEMBER FIRST THEY WANNA KNOW QUITE QUITE SHOULD WE BE PLANNING FOR WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHAT'S THE LEGISLATURE DOING. I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE SEEN THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL- IN LIGHT OF THE ONGOING PANDEMIC. EXTENDED THE EMERGENCY RELIEF THAT HAD BEEN EXTENDED EXPIRES SEPTEMBER FIRST. I DON'T KNOW ALL THE REASONS FOR THEIR RELUCTANCE BUT APPARENTLY THEY FEAR. LAWSUIT SWUNG MAYBE THEY SHOULD BE STANDING UP FOR US AS WE KNOW AS THE LEGISLATURE TRYING TO STAND UP FOR THE PEOPLE. THAT WE REPRESENT. THIS BILL SEEKS TO SATISFY MULTIPLE INTERESTS AND YET I THINK IT'S UNREALISTIC TO THINK OF FAMILY WITHOUT EMPLOYMENT. WITHOUT ANY EXTENSION OF THE CARE SACKED OR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS- OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF ECONOMIC RELIEF. WILL BE ABLE TO PAY 25% SOME MIGHT BE ABLE TO BE. SACRIFICING FOOD OR MEDICINE TO SCRAPE TOGETHER 25% OF THE RENT THERE'S NO MAGIC NUMBER HERE AND IF THE FAMILY. IS IMPACTED BY COVERT NINETEEN. IN THIS IS. TENANTS AND PROPERTY OWNERS- WE LOOK TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT-IS THE CHAIR HAS SAID IN THE INACTION OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TO COMMIT TO FURTHER ECONOMIC RELIEF NOT JUST FOR CALIFORNIANS BUT FOR ALL AMERICANS. IS AT THE CORE OF THIS CRISIS. IN THE SOLUTION IS NOT TO BE FOUND IN A LABORAT PUZZLES OF YOU PAY 25% NOW AND YOU CARRY THIS AND THAT AND THEN IT TO DO AND THEN YOU CAN BE TAKEN TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT AND STILL FACE EVICTION. THAT'S NOT A SOLUTION IT'S SOME FIRST AID TO TRY TO FORESTALL. THE INEVITABLE SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY BUT WITH THE RESERVATIONS THAT I HAVE ARTICULATED AND THAT WE SHOULDN'T WAIT UNTIL. JANUARY OR FEBRUARY OF NEXT YEAR TO START FIGURING OUT THE SEQUENTIAL BILL I JUST SAY TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO. THERE'S NO MAGIC DATE BY WHICH THEY SHOULD END THE MAGIC DATE REALLY BEHIND THIS AND OUR ECONOMY IS RESTORED IN PEOPLE CAN GO BACK TO WORK AND THEY CAN WORK AND PAY THEIR RENT- AND HAVE THE SECURITY OF THAT INTEL WE'RE AT THAT POINT. THE IN SECURITY WILL CONTINUE TO HANG OVER THE HEADS OF ALL CALIFORNIANS OF ALL AMERICANS AND THERE WILL BE MORE HOMELESSNESS IT'LL BE MORE SUFFERING FROM NOT JUST THE DIRECT MEDICAL IMPACTS OF COVERT NINETEEN BUT THE RELATED IMPACTS OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES- SUBSTANCE ABUSE EVERYTHING THAT'S UNFOLDING AS A RESULT. OF OUR INABILITY. TO GET IN FRONT OF COVERT NINETEEN SO AGAIN I THINK THE AUTHORS MORE OF A STATEMENT NOT REALLY A QUESTION- I GUESS JUST IT TO MAYBE. SHARE A QUESTION FROM. WHAT'S THE COMMITMENT OF THE PARTIES INVOLVED IN THIS AGREEMENT TO KEEP WORKING BETWEEN NO AND THE EXPIRATION OF THESE TEMPORARY RELIEF MEASURES. IT MADE UP EVERYONE IS TO CONTINUE WORKING OVER THE FALL TO START THE DAY AFTER WE'RE DONE. WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK TO DO AND PART OF IT IS MAKE IS CONTINUING TO COME TO THE TABLE I MEAN EVERYTHING EVERYBODY HAS SAID IT'S REALLY TRUE WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THIS IS GOING TO END WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT THE STATE. FISCAL SITUATIONS GOING TO BE- WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER PEOPLE ARE GOING TO START GOING BACK TO WORK THE NEW I THINK THE NEW FRAMEWORK THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS LAID OUT WITH THE DIFFERENT COLORS AND KIND OF GOING BACK MAKES TOTAL SENSE AND WE SHOULD PROBABLY STARTED THAT TWO MONTHS AGO JUST SO THAT WE CAN SEE. PROGRESS BUT EVERYBODY'S COMMITTED AND WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT DONE WITH THIS WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A LOT MORE TO DO AND WE'LL GET BACK THE CONVERSATIONS WILL CONTINUE THIS. LET ME JUST SAY THAT THIS ALL HAS TO DO WITH MONEY MMHM IT'S RESOURCES AND TO THE CHALLENGES WERE LOOKING AT THE CRYSTAL BALL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN DO. BETWEEN NOW AND IN DECEMBER- WHICH ARE BUDGET GOING TO LOOK LIKE. WHAT ARE OUR RESOURCES GOING TO LOOK LIKE AND HOW CAN WE USE THEM TO LEVERAGE OTHER RESOURCES WHETHER IT'S THE BANK OR THE CREDIT UNIONS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW MONEY IS. IS CHEAP IF YOU CAN BORROW IT. BUT NO ONE CAN RIGHT SO HERE WHAT'S THE PERFECT COMBINATION THERE'S A COMMITMENT TO WORK I CAN TELL YOU THAT RIGHT THANK YOU I APPRECIATE A MAN SHOULD JUST KIND OF A FINAL COMMENT. AS AS THE AUTHOR SAID THE CO AUTHOR. IT'S ALL ABOUT MONEY. BUT THE MONEY AVAILABLE TO. A WORKING FAMILY ON A LIMITED INCOME. STRETCHING TO RAISE RENT MONEY EACH MONTH. IS DIFFERENT THAN THE BURDEN. ON A LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. THAT IS AN INTEREST GROUP THEY HAVE AN INTEREST IN GETTING THEIR MONEY- BUT THERE EXECUTIVES MAKING TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR. THEY'RE NOT BEING ASKED TO FOR BEAR ON. HUGE INCOMES. THERE IS SOME RELATIVE. A HUGE RELATIVE DIFFERENCE IN THE ABILITY TO SHOULDER ON THE PAIN OF THIS SO ARE BETTER ABLE TO FOUR BETTER THAN OTHERS- SO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ALL THE VOTING ON IT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK A CINEMA IN THE OFFICE INDEED TO AND THAT'S PART OF I THINK THE EFFORT THAT'S BEEN MADE. OF AGAIN WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO SEE ANYTHING MORE COME OUT OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WOULD LOOK AT WHETHER THEY CAN BE EXTENSIONS OF THE CARES ACTON. ARMY IT'S JUST SO ON KNOWN WE ARE LIVING IN UNCHARTED WATERS. WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT LEVEL OF LEADERSHIP WE'RE GOING TO SEE. THE STATE IS DOING ITS BEST TO ALL FIFTY STATES HAVE FIFTY DIFFERENT SETS OF RULES COUNTIES HAVE. FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT SETS OF RULES IN THIS IS. THIS A SITUATION WHERE WE WOULD BE HARD PRESSED TO HAVE A QUICK CANCER OR EIGHT A CLEAR ANSWER SO I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT THE EFFORTS GOING TO BE MADE. THROUGHOUT AS THEY SHOULD BE BECAUSE- AGAIN PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING AND- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I NOTICED THIS DOES NOT. IN IN ANY WAY. EITHER REDUCE THE OBLIGATION TO PAY THE RNT THE OBLIGATIONS STILL THERE IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN TO PAY BACK RENT. OF THE OBLIGATION BECOMES UP UP AS A CREDIT. AND THE- TENANT IS PROTECTED BECAUSE THAT DOES NOT GET REPORTED TO THE CREDIT AGENCIES. RIGHT BUT THE OBLIGATION CONTINUES IT IS IT IS NOT FORGIVEN AND BUT BUT THE REALITY THE SITUATION IS HE YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO THAT DEBTS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT NEVER GET PAID. I MEAN THERE'S A WAY TO BE ABLE TO TRY TO ENFORCE THEM BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT SO THE CHALLENGE IS GOING TO BE BACK BACK RENT AND EVER BEING ABLE TO COLLECT IT. RIGHT NOW AND THE CHALLENGE I THINK IS FOR EVERYONE FOR US TO. NOT ONLY GET BACK ON OUR FEET BUT TO BE ABLE TO RECOVER. FULLY FROM THIS OTHERS MUCH AHEAD OF US US SENATOR- THE RISE SO I BELIEVE YOU HAD A COMMENTER QUESTIONS THANK YOU- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- I WANNA THANK- SENATOR BOB IDEA AT ALL AND SHE'S BEEN WORKING REALLY REALLY HARD ALONG WITH A- ASSEMBLY MEMBER. CHIU I JUST WANT TO DESCRIBE AND- CONNECT THIS WITH WITH MY OWN DISTRICT. MY DISTRICT IN LOS ANGELES HAS THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF RENTERS IN THE ENTIRE STATE. SEVENTY SEVEN PERCENT. OF THE MEN WOMEN IN MY DISTRICT ARE RENTERS. THE IMPACT OF THAT IS GOING TO BE SEVERE. AND OVERWHELMING. MANY OF THESE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE SOME WELL OFF NEIGHBORHOODS BUT MOST OF THEM ARE WORKING CLASS IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES WE ALSO HAVE THE HELP OF SOME OF THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF OVERCROWDED CONDITIONS OVERCROWDING MEANING MORE THAN OF A RATIONAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE PER ROOM OVERCROWDED. THEY WORK AND ESSENTIAL JOBS WHERE THEY ALSO ARE NOW FACING CIRCLE BY YOUR NOSE THIS FOR OUR REPRESENTING OUR AGRICULTURE AND THE JOBS OF THE FARMWORKERS TO. ESSENTIAL WORK ESSENTIAL WORKERS. AND THESE ARE THE CONDITIONS THAT THEY LIVED IN. PART OF THE REALITY WE'RE FACING HERE TODAY IS THAT THERE WAS ALREADY AN EMERGENCY BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. THERE WAS ALREADY AN EMERGENCY. THAT WE WERE NOT SOLVING. THERE WAS AN EMERGENCY AS FAR AS HOUSING THERE WAS AN EMERGENCY AS FAR AS HOMELESSNESS AND SO WE IT'S NOT LIKE THIS JUST JUMPED OUT AT US ALL OF A SUDDEN IT DID BUT HAD WE NOT HAD THOSE CONDITIONS BEFOREHAND I THINK IT MIGHT OF YOU KNOW WHO KNOWS MIGHT A LITTLE BIT MORE MANAGEABLE. TENANTS DID NOT WERE NOT STABLE PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC AND THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO PUT HERE IN THE CONVERSATION AS WELL AND I KNOW SOME OF US TRIED TO WORK WITH THEM AS A WORKING GROUP HOUSING WORKING GROUP WHILE WE WERE TRYING TO DEAL WITH THIS AT THE SAME TIME TRYING TO THINK MID TERM AND LONG TERM AS FAR AS HOUSING BUT TENANTS STABILIZATION IS AN EMERGENCY BEFORE HAND AND IT'S EVEN MORE OF AN EMERGENCY NOW. I HAD SEVERAL BILLS ALONG WITH ALL FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO A. B. FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO ABOUT RENT RENTERS ABOUT THEM BEING ABLE TO STAY IN THE HOMES ABOUT THEM BEING ABLE TO STAY IN SPITE OF THE GENTRIFICATION IN SPITE OF THE PUSH OUT SO THAT OTHERS COULDN'T MOVE IN AND. TAKE OVER THEIR THEIR COMMUNITIES. SO THE- OUT ECONOMIC INTEREST THEY ARE OUTSIDE ECONOMIC INTERESTS FROM THOSE WHO REALLY CARE ABOUT OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. IS GETTING HAS GOTTEN IN THE WAY IT ALWAYS HAS pBEEN THE ONE TO GET IN THE WAY OF TRYING TO GET BETTER TENANT PROTECTIONS. AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES. WHAT ARE WE GONNA TAKE WAS WHERE WE- CAN TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. FOR THE FACT THAT. THIS PROPOSAL CHANGED FROM SOMETHING THAT WAS MUCH MORE. IT WAS STILL A SHORT TERM BUT IT CHANGED IN A MATTER OF WHAT A WEEK. IN A MATTER OF% A WEEK. SO I FIND MYSELF LIKE THIS IS TERRIBLE WHY WE LET THIS HAPPEN FROM A WEEK AGO TO TODAY. WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO HAVE A GREATER POLITICAL WILL. YOU KNOW MORE THAN HALF OF CALIFORNIANS ARE RENTERS MORE THAN HALF. SO ARE WE HAVE TO COME TO GRIPS WITH THIS ARE WE GOING TO APPROACH THIS AND I KNOW THERE'S AND I I'D LIKE TO HEAR A LITTLE BIT MORE SENATE BYE BYE YET ABOUT THIS PROCESS MOVING FORWARD. BECAUSE I CAN'T COME BACK. IN JANUARY AND SAY WELL HERE WE ARE AGAIN. SORRY WE DIDN'T COME UP WITH SOMETHING STRONGER TO PROTECT YOU WELL WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER TWO MONTHS BANDAID. THAT'S JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR US IN CALIFORNIA AND WE HAVE A GREATER ABILITY WE HAVE THE POWER TO BE ABLE TO DO MUCH MORE MUCH DEEPER. THEIR ORGANIZATION IN LOS ANGELES CALL CHIRLA THAT WENT THROUGH- I THINK IT TOOK A MONTH OR SIX WEEKS SOMETHING- TO BE ABLE TO DISTRIBUTE ONE TIME FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR CHECKS. WITHIN THE COMMUNITY ONE TIME FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR CHECKS AND THEY SAID THAT. ALMOST EVERY SINGLE ONE OVERWHELMINGLY. THOSE FAMILIES WERE CRYING ABOUT HOW THEY NEEDED THAT CHECK TO HELP THEM KEEP THEIR APARTMENT IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT WE HAD A MORATORIUM. IN SPITE OF THAT. THEY WERE SCARED TO DEATH AND THAT ENTIRE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR CHECK WAS CAN BE GIVEN TO THE LANDLORD AS A PLEASE TO LET THEM STAY IN THOSE HOMES IN THOSE APARTMENTS. THAT'S HOW DESPERATE THEY- PUT ASIDE WHETHER THEY HAVE PUT ON THE TABLE THEY JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES CAN YOU IMAGINE THEM FACING. BEING HOMELESS SO. I'M BY NO. WELL I HAVE TO HAVE A COMMITMENT THAT'S MUCH MUCH DEEPER. MUCH MUCH MORE COURAGEOUS ALL OF US I'M CLEAN MYSELF MUCH MUCH MORE COURAGEOUS ABOUT PUSHING FOR THE A REAL SOLUTION AND I INCLUDE IN THAT I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES HERE THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL HAS A LOT TO DO. WITH WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO HERE ON HERE ON THE GROUND AND IN CALIFORNIA AND IN IN OUR COMMUNITIES BUT WE HAVE TO BE READY. THAT WE DON'T HAVE A CHANGE IN THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION WE HAVE TO BE READY TO DEAL WITH THAT AND I WOULD PROPOSE THAT WE SERIOUSLY LOOK AT A SPECIAL SESSION WE NEED ALL OF THE POWER OF US TOGETHER TO SAY THIS IS A PRIORITY. SO MAYBE CENTER CUT BY YOUR YOU CAN. TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE IF YOU CAN I DON'T KNOW. BECAUSE YOU'RE SO BUSY DOING THIS WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE- IS HOW DO YOU ENVISION OR HOW TO THE REST OF. YOUR YOUR YOUR COLLEAGUES AUTHORS ENVISION. HOW WE CONTINUE TO PUSH THIS FORWARD BECAUSE- I WANT TO BE IN THE SITUATION AGAIN IN A FEW MONTHS WHY DON'T WE DO THIS. I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS WHAT ARE YOU. OH I'M SORRY CENTER MELINDA'S YOU'RE HERE AND YOU DO HAVE A QUESTION WOULD YOU RESERVE THAT AGAIN FOCUSING PRIMARILY ON THE BILL THAT TO. THAT WE HAVE HUGE PROBLEMS NO QUESTION BUT WITH RESPECT TO THE ISSUES IN THE BILL US SENATOR. I'M THE FIRST ONE I WANT TO DO IS ASK A QUESTION OF SENATOR CABALLERO- YOU SAID THAT. THE CHALLENGE IS GOING TO BE GETTING THAT BACK RENTS. PAID TO THE LANDLORD AND I WONDER IF YOU COULD JUST. REFRESH MY MEMORY HOW IT HOW EXACTLY THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- TO THE CHAIR- THE THAT- DEAD DEAD DEAD. WILL BECOME A SMALL CLAIMS COURT DEBT. IN OTHER WORDS YOU CAN COLLECTED IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT THIS WILL PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LANDLORD NOT TO GO THROUGH A SUPERIOR COURT CASE IN ITS ITS LENGTHY. LIKELY TO COST A LOT OF MONEY AND ALSO LIKELY TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY DELAYED THERE ARE OTHER PRIORITIES THE COURTS HAVE BEEN OUT OF SESSION FOR AS LONG AS WE WERE TO. SO IT WOULD BECOME A DEBT PAYABLE A COLLECTIBLE THROUGH SMALL CLAIMS COURT ITSELF IT'S FAIRLY EASY TO FILE THE PAPERWORK AND TO GO AND IT PROVIDES AN ALTERNATIVE FOR THE TEN IT IS WELL. TO BE ABLE TO GO AND DEFEND THEMSELVES OR SAY YEAH I DO IT AND OR OR THE AMOUNT IS DIFFERENT AND HERE'S WHAT I'LL- AFTER ONCE I GET A JUDGMENT AND THEY COLLECTED JUST LIKE ANY ANY JUDGMENT ON THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASK. FOR INFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER THE TEN TO TEN AND IS WORKING OR NOT TO DO AT. A CREDITOR ED JET THAT. I'M DRAWING A BLANK ON THE WORD TO BUT THE- THEY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SIT DOWN WITH THE- TENANT. AND TO ASK THEM QUESTIONS AND USE THAT INFORMATION TO DO TO GET IN A COURT ORDER TO THEN- STARTED CATCHING WAGES OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT THEY MAKE. THAT THEY MAY HAVE SO IT BECOMES A DEBT LIKE ANY OTHER DEBT THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT IT DOES NOT GET REPORTED TO THE- CREDIT REPORTING AGENCY SO THAT IT DOESN'T. FUNDAMENTALLY HURT THEIR THEIR OPPORTUNITY GET LOANS AND- IN THE FUTURE HE SAID THE DEBTOR'S EXAMINATION LETTERHEADS AMINATION THAT'S WHAT OKAY GREAT THANK YOU OKAY. AND THEN- OR HOW HOW WILL THIS. WORK IF YOU HAVE. AT TEN THAT WOULD NOW BE PROTECT. UNDER THIS BELT LET'S SAY. IN ADDITION TO NOT. BEING ABLE TO PAY THEIR RENT. AND THEY ARE ALSO NOT COMPLYING WITH. THE RULES AND THE NEIGHBORHOOD WEATHER BACK TO NATURE WHERE JUST SIMPLY YOU KNOW THEM. THE ROLES OF TENANCY THE RESPECTED OUR CONTRACTS SO LIKE SENATOR BOARD JUST POINT OUT IF YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE WHO WERE HAVING LOUD PARTIES WHO ARE PARKING WHERE THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO YOU KNOW JUST DOING ARE NOT BEING A GOOD TENANT ARE THEY- THIS LAW AND THEN- CAN PROTECT THAT TYPE OF BEHAVIOR AS WELL NO IT DOES NOT. IT DOESN'T IT DOES NOT KNOW ANY IS A NORMAL- BASIS FOR EVICTION OTHER THAN NON PAYMENT OF RENT STILL APPLY SO IF YOU HAD A TENANT WHO IS CAUSING WASTE TO THE PROPERTY OR CREATING NUISANCE. TO THE LEVEL OF A TERM OF THE FOR INNOVATION. THOSE VISIONS ARE STILL APPROPRIATE. BUT EVEN IS THAT ALSO. EVEN IF THEY HAVE SUBMITTED THEIR LETTER SAYING THAT THEY ARE UNABLE TO PAY THE RENT DUE TO COME IN FOR IT ABSOLUTELY. ABSOLUTELY OKAY IT DOESN'T IT'S NOT AN EXCUSE. OKAY I JUST WANTED TO SORT OF MAKE SURE I WAS CLEAR ON THIS BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY GOING TO CAUSE SOME CONFUSION FOR LANDLORDS AND TENANTS- I JUST WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS- YOU KNOW I'VE HEARD A LOT OF. OUR STATEMENTS ABOUT WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. HASN'T DONE WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE DOING THAT HASN'T BEEN ENOUGH THERE HASN'T BEEN ANYTHING I JUST. WANT TO POINT OUT THAT IT. NUMBER ONE IF THE GOVERNOR WOULD ALLOW MORE SECTORS OF OUR INDUSTRY TO OPEN UP PEOPLE TO GO BACK TO WORK AND HAVE THE MONEY IN ORDER TO PAY THE RENT AND HE'S NOT ALLOWED THAT TO HAPPEN SO I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK. IN THE MIRROR WHEN WE'RE DISCUSSING THIS ISSUE BECAUSE WE ARE NOT WITHOUT FAULT I THIS RESPECT OR AT LEAST THE GOVERNOR IS IN MY EYES HE JUST RELEASED. A NEW YOU KNOW NEW RULES OF ENGAGEMENT FOR COUNTY STEPPING UP AND PEOPLE CAN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THAT SO I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE TALKED ABOUT AS WELL NUMBER TWO. IT YOU KNOW THE COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA. IS EXTREMELY HIGH THE COST OF BRENT AND CALIFORNIA IS INCREDIBLY HIGH. THAT IS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FEDERAL GVERNMENT THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE POLICY THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE. BY OUR LEGISLATURE. IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE GOVERNMENT SO AGAIN I SUGGEST RATHER THAN. POINTING FINGER SOLELY AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE TAKE A HARD LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR AS WELL- ALL RIGHT. THIS THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT HAS A LOT OF PEOPLE REALLY ON PINS AND NEEDLES- FOR SURE AND I WANNA. THANK CENTER CAVIAR AND EVERYONE ELSE ON THE BILL FOR TAKING THIS ISSUE HEAD ON AND TRYING TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION. IN WHICH YOU KNOW YOU CANNOT PLEASE EVERYONE IT IS JUST IMPOSSIBLE- AND THANK YOU FOR TAKING. THE SLINGS AND ARROWS ON THIS BILL- AND I APPRECIATE THE TIME TO MAKE MY COMMENTS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER MELINDA'S I JUST WANT TO RESPOND VERY BRIEFLY THAT TO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER WE SHOULD BE OPENING UP YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY A QUESTION OF HOW MUCH WE VALUE HUMAN LIFE. BUT WE'VE HAD TEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS STOCK. TEN THOUSAND MINUTES. TO AN EXTRAORDINARY NUMBER OF PEOPLE- THAT. BY MAY IF WE IF WE HAD NOT. IF WE HAD NOT CLOSED THE STATE. IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN NEW YORK. THIRTY SEVEN THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE DIED WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME BECAUSE- OF COLD IT. WAS RUNNING RAMPANT SO- I YOU KNOW I THINK WE'LL ALL BE. MONDAY MORNING QUARTERBACKS ON THIS FOR A LONG TIME AS TO. WHAT WE SHOULD AND SHOULDN'T HAVE SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE- AS FAR AS CALIFORNIA BEING AN EXPENSIVE STATE IT IS INDEED AN EXPENSIVE STATE IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PLACE TO LIVE. AND SO THE VALUE OF PROPERTY. A SOMETHING A PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS THE VALUE PROPERTY IS VERY EXPENSIVE- SO. A ONE COULD ARGUE THAT THE COST OF BUILDING. A IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN IT MIGHT BE BUT IT ALSO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR US HAVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE WE HAVE HERE SO. THERE ARE CERTAINLY ISSUES THAT WE CAN. AGREE ON AN AGREE TO DISAGREE ON BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES THAT I THINK WE'RE ADDRESSING HERE- THAT THIS BILL TRIES TO ADDRESS THAT ARE REFLECTIVE OF A BIGGER PROBLEM. ASSOCIATED WITH A PANDEMIC FOR WHICH WE STILL TO THE STATE. HAVE VERY LITTLE TREATMENT- WE HAVE NO CURE AND WE HAVE NO VACCINE. AND THAT'S PART OF THE NKNOWN THAT I THINK WE'RE ALL TO DEAL WITH SO. MOVE THE BILL I APPRECIATE THAT- THAT DISCUSSION AND WE DO HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR WHITE CAL SKI I'M SORRY. SORRY CENTER Y. CASKEY. ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION HERE- SEEING. BOB. HE'S OFFICES ARE USING FURNITURE EVERYTHING. WE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A MOTION- WE'RE GOING TO- ASK SENATOR CAFIERO TO CLOSE AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE CENTER MELINDA'S DID YOU WANT TO SAY ANYTHING YOUR HAND WAS UP AND THEN IT WENT DOWN. YOU'RE ALL SET. VERY GOOD THANK YOU SENATOR CAMBIADO YOU MAY CLOSE. MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND A COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY HAVE THIS ROBUST DISCUSSION- THAT DISCUSSION WAS VERY SIMILAR TO THE MANY MANY MANY HOURS OF CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAD AMONG OURSELVES TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW WE WERE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET TO YES THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION S WORK. THIS IS A NEGOTIATION BETWEEN THE SENATE THE ASSEMBLY AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. AND WHILE- IN ARBIL SB FOURTEEN TEN WE THOUGHT THE STATE OUGHT TO BE PUTTING UP SOME MONEY. TO BE ABLE TO. HELP TO- CREATE OPPORTUNITIES WHETHER IT WAS- THROUGH A TAX CREDIT OR WHETHER IT WAS TO LEVERAGE. MONIES THAT BANKS HAD- WE JUST COULDN'T GET THERE IN THE IN THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WE HAD IT AND FRANKLY. ARE PART OF THE REASON IS BECAUSE OF THE UNKNOWNS THE UNKNOWNS YOU KNOW WHEN IS THIS PANDEMIC GOING TO GOING TO A- OR- IS IT ACTUALLY GOING TO START. GOING DOWN UP WE JUST HAVEN'T SEEN IT AND I WERE. BACK IN APRIL WHEN THEY SAID WE THINK THE NUMBERS ARE GOING TO GO UP GO DOWN IN JUNE AND WHEN THAT WHEN THE SUMMERS HERE AND I THOUGHT JUNE ALL MY GOSH THAT'S SO FAR AWAY AND HERE WE ARE IN ITS SEPTEMBER. IN TWO DAYS AND SO- ALL OUR PROJECT PROJECTIONS AND PREDICTIONS FOR THIS VIRUS HAVE HAVE GONE OUT THE WINDOW AND SO. THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO GET US THROUGH THE YEAR. SO THAT WE CAN MAN. SO AS- THE AS WERE OUT OF SESSION WE CAN LOOK AT. TAKING PROBABLY VERY LIMITED STATE RESOURCES. AND USING THEM TO LEVERAGE OTHER RESOURCES AND HOPEFULLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL COME IN AS A PARTNER AND HELP US TO MAKE- SOME SOME CHOICES AYE AYE. IN TERMS OF RESOURCES RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO BE FINISHING THE BUDGET. IN THE TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE SPENDING WE'RE SPENDING LOTS OF MONEY ON A LOT OF THINGS SO WE KNOW WHEN WE YOU TALK ABOUT WILL YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT CENTER DRIVE SO WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT IF WE HAVE THE WILL. TO PUT MONEY INTO HOUSING AND TO BE TWO THINGS THAT ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO CHANGE THE REALITY FOR PEOPLE ON THE GROUND- WHETHER IT'S HOMELESSNESS OR PEOPLE LIVING IN SIGNIFICANTLY OVERCROWDED SITUATIONS WHICH IS A SEPARATE ISSUE- SO THE QUESTION HERE IS- THIS ISN'T A PERFECT BILL THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE DON'T GET EVICTED. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY THE RENT AND THE REALLY GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE DATA THAT WE'VE HAD OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS IS THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THEIR LANDLORDS AND MAKING PAYMENTS EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT PAYING THE ENTIRE PAY RENT DUE AND I EXPECT THAT THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE BECAUSE PEOPLE FEEL A REAL COMMITMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE HOUSING IS SECURE. AND SO WHAT THIS DOES IS IT SETS UP A FRAMEWORK FOR US TO BE ABLE TO TELL LANDLORDS AND TENANTS THIS IS HOW YOUR HOW YOU'RE GOING TO- MANAGE THAT THE SITUATION AND WE DON'T WANT TO EVICTING PEOPLE AND WE WANT TENANTS TO PAY AT LEAST 25% OF THE RENT AND IF YOU'RE MAKING MORE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY MORE UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN. IMPACTED BY THE CORONAVIRUS FINANCIALLY AND- AND HOPEFULLY WILL KEEP PEOPLE OUT OF COURT THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE AND IT WILL WORK THE COMMITMENT IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO STAY AT THE TABLE AND WE'LL WORK THROUGH THE THROUGH THE END FROM TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT PIECES WE CAN PUT TOGETHER FOR THE NEW YEAR.
