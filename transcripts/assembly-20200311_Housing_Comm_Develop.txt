THOUSAND TWENTY MEETING OF THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE I WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH NUMBERS AT THIS MOMENT TO ESTABLISH QUORUMS ASK CIVIC AND THE- SUBCOMMITTEE ON. END WITHOUT A- ITEM I KNOW A MISTER CHEN WAS HERE FIRST BUT HE IS ALLOWED MS RIVAS 2% FIRST NOW YOU'VE GOT A PLACE YOU GOT TO BE SO PLEASE COME HELP PRESENT AND ONE. EIGHTY FIVE. THE. WHEN YOU'RE READY GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS- I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF UP FOR THEIR THOROUGH EVALUATION OF THIS LEGISLATION- ON THE MEASURE BEFORE YOU MAKES A NUMBER OF STRUCTURAL CHANGES- TO HOW THIS OVERSEE LAMENTS IT'S HOMELESS PROGRAMS AB EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE ESTABLISHES THE OFFICE TO AND HOMELESS AS- HOUSE IN THE GOVERNOR OFFICE. THE OFFICE WILL BE OVERSEEN BY A NEW SECRETARY AND HOUSING AND SECURED IN HOME. NEW SECRETARY BE IN CHARGE OVERSEE ALL STATE RAMPS WE TO YOU TO AGE BY EXIST ENTIT. OVER DECADES THE STATE HAS ADDED MORE AND LAYERS OF NEW POLICIES TO COMBAT THE INCREASING HOMELESSNESS EPIDEMIC THEY'RE CURRENTLY AT LEAST THIRTEEN DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS ADMINISTERING OVER THIRTY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS RELATED. TO HOMELESSNESS. ALL OF THIS IS ALL WELL AND- THE PROCESS HAS CREATED A SYSTEM THAT IS HIGHLY FRAGMENTED OFTEN WITH COMPETING GOALS THAT ULTIMATELY RESULT IN A DISJOINTED RESPONSE TO THIS CRISIS. THIS FRAGMENTATION HAS BEEN TALKING IT OVER THE YEARS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE THE- GEN REC NINE ALL HOPELESS STATE PROGRAMS TO BE HOUSED UNDER ONE ENTITY. ALMOST THREE DECADES LATER AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR REPORTED THE CORE REASON OUR AND SHELTERED HOMELESS POPULATION EXCEEDS THAT OF OTHER STATES IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE OTHER STATES HAVE A SINGLE ENTITY CHART SPECIFICALLY WITH THE DRESSING HOMELESS. AS SIMPLY AS LAST MONTH THE LA- COMMENTED ON THE STATE'S CURRENT APPROACH TO ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS BY ASSERTING AND I QUOTE. ADDRESSING A PROBLEM AS COMPLEX AND INTERCONNECTED AS HOMELESS THIS REQUIRES THE INVOLVEMENT OF DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE COOPERATION. WITH ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AND OTHER. STAKEHOLDERS AND QUOTE. THEY GO ON TO SAY A FRAGMENTED RESPONSE CREATES VARIOUS CHALLENGES INCLUDING FACULTY TRACKING ALL HOMELESSNESS RELATED EXPENDITURES ACROSS THE STATE. THE TERM AND HOW DOES WORK AB LEE. AND ALSO DIFFICULT ASSESSING WHAT PROGRAMS ARE COLLECTIVELY PUBLISHED. I'M KNOW THAT HOMELESSNESS THE STATE WIDE CRISIS- THIS LEGISLATURE HAS DEDICATED SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO COMBAT HOMELESSNESS WELL STATE FUNDING PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE. IN THE FIGHT AGAINST HOMELESSNESS FUNDING LOAN WILL NOT CALL SYSTEMIC SHOES IT'S TIME WE FIND DRESS ARE STRUCTURAL ISSUES AT THE STATE LEVEL. SO TODAY I HAVE I'M SURE REPORT DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE POLICY- FOR THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING AND CHRIS MARTIN SINGS LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR HOUSING CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU MISTER PORTER MISTER. READING CHAIRS A MEMBERS MY NAME IS CHRISTOPHER MARTIN WITH HOUSING CALIFORNIA ONE OF THE PROUD BECAUSE SPONSORS OF AB EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE HOUSING CALIFORNIA IS A NONPROFIT ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION WITH THE MISSION TO ENSURE THAT NO ONE IS HOMELESS AND EVERYONE REGARDLESS OF INCOME THE SAFE STABLE AND AFFORDABLE PLACE TO LIVE. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER STATED CALIFORNIA HAS FUNDED WELL OVER TWENTY FIVE PROGRAMS RELATED HOMELESSNESS AND A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES EACH WITH DIFFERENT GOAL AND POPULATION TARGETS AND AS A RESULT ONE OF THE MOST RESPONSES FROM PROVIDERS AND WE SIT IN THE COMMUNITIES. I'D WAS THAT ALMOST PRO LET. NATION SERVICE PROVIDERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FILL MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS REQUIRING DIFFERENT CRITERIA AND DEADLINES WITH NO CROSS AGENCY OR COURT CROSS DEPARTMENTAL COLLABORATION. AND PROGRAMS OFTEN HAVE INCONSISTENT OFTEN CONFLICTING REQUIREMENTS. MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE ALSO NOT pINTERVENTIONS WHICH MEANS WE ARE NOT ACTUALLY DECREASING HOMELESSNESS IN OUR STATE AT THE RATE AND I THINK OF HIS ADVOCACY THAT WE COULD. AB EIGHT FORTY FIVE WOULD CREATE A NEW OFFICE WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WHOSE CHIEF GOAL WOULD BE TO COORDINATE AMONG THE STATE AGENCIES AND PROGRAMS TO BREAK DOWN SILOS CREATED BY FUNDING MANY DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS. BRING TO. THE AND KNOWLEDGE OF HOW CONSERVE. THE STAFF TO OUR IN A CORE SET OF STANDARDS FOR HOUSING AND HOUSING BASED SERVICES. FOLLOW EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTIONS PROVENTO AND HOMELESSNESS AND INSTITUTE BACKS PRACTICES FOR PREVENTING CALIFORNIANS FROM EXITING STATE FUNDED INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS INTO HOMELESSNESS. THIS OFFICE WILL STEP FORWARD A CLEAR FOCUS STRATEGY FOR THE STATE'S PATH TOWARDS ENDING HOMELESSNESS AND ENSURING THAT EVERYONE HAS A SAFE AFFORDABLE PLACE TO LIVE. IS FOR INPUT FUNDING AND- HOME. BEING AN EVIDENCE BASED SOLUTIONS HOUSING CALIFORNIA APPLAUD ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE IS PROUD TO CUT A CO SPONSOR AB EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR IDOL THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE MORNING SURE FOR WITH CORPORATION FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING- I SERVED ON THE GOVERNOR'S COUNCIL REGIONAL HOMELESS ADVISORS WHICH MOST PEOPLE PURCHASE THE GOVERNOR'S TASK FORCE- AND CSA TO THE CODE. ON A TEN FORTY FIVE. LONG CALIFORNIA HAS LACKED A SINGLE THE OVER THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS STATED HOMELESSNESS IS A COMPLEX CHALLENGE- TOUCHING MANY DIFFERENT ISSUES EDUCATION AND CHILD WELFARE OUR OUR HEALTH CARE. CORRECTIONS AS EXAMPLES- BUT WE'VE NEVER HAD A SINGLE AGENCY OFFICE OR INDIVIDUAL TO OVERSEE A SINGLE COORDINATED CLAPPER. ON SINGLE THAT LEAVE THE STATE'S ON AUTHORITY AND HOMELESS S. AND BIG BLUE LETTERS AND GOVERNOR. COME IS IT. EXPECTED TO BE. THE WHOLE THIS CALL THANKS OF ITS THREE WE KNOW THAT'S ALL IT. YEP BECAUSE WE HAVE NO IF MEN OF OUR AGENCIES ADMINISTERING PROGRAMS THAT ARE NOT BASED ON EVIDENCE FOR THIS REASON TO CRITICAL RECOMMENDATIONS COMING FROM THE TASK FORCE. WERE TO CREATE A SINGLE POINT OF AUTHORITY AND- TO HAVE A STANDARDIZED RESPONSE FROM OUR ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS THAT ARE CHARGED WITH ENDING HOMELESS. UNDER EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE THE SINGLE POINT OF AUTHORITY AS SECRETARY WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WILL ENSURE PROGRAMS ARE ACHIEVING THAT OUT. THE LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR AND THE TAX PAYER EXPECT. IT ALSO WOULD STANDARDIZE THEIR STATE'S RESPONSE TO THAT PROGRAMS ARE FUNDING THE SAME TYPE OF HOUSING AND HOUSING BASED SERVICES INTERVENTIONS AND EVENTUALLY BLENDING FUNDING THAT COULD BE USED TO PAY FOR HOUSING AND SERVICES. IS SIMPLY WILL MAKE OUR SYSTEMS MORE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT AND FOUND A SPREAD OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS MORE WISELY. THE OFFICE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR REGULARLY CONVENING STAFF AT THE AGENCIES TO DO THE WORK OF STANDARDIZING THE STATE'S BOND. AND IF IT EVENTUALLY BURKE TO CREATE A UNIVERSAL APPLICATION OF WHAT OUR HOUSE AND SERVICE PROVIDERS TWO BUY FOR STATE FUNDING- WITHOUT NAVIGATING CONFLICTING PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS LIKE WE HAVE. I APPRECIATE IT ASSEMBLYMEMBER RIVAS LEADERSHIP AND TAKING ON THIS BILL AND REQUEST DRIVE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE OTHER SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL. THEN ASH OVER THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION SUPPORT. STEPHANIE SHIRKY WITH THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. AND IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SEEN ON THE BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY COMMENTS. THIS COURSE OF ACTUALLY BEFORE WE PROCEED IF I COULD ESTABLISH QUORUM MADAM SECRETARY. TO HEAR TO HEAR TAPE. GABRIEL GLORIA GLORIA HERE KILEY KILEY HERE MON. MAIENSCHEIN MENTION HERE QUIRK SILVA HERE LOOKS LIKE HERE WE HAVE A QUORUM IS QUIRK SILVA- YES THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD INTO THE SPONSORS- AT. ELITE B. SUPPORT THIS BILL AND I KNOW WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THIS LAST YEAR AS WE WERE WORKING ON ONE OF OUR BILLS. BUT AFTER ATTENDING A WEEK HELPING POLICY. THERE ARE SO MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUT IN THE POLICY BE CA. OUT OF ALL MUCH MONEY DO WE HAVE HOW'S IT BEEN WHAT ARE THE GAS IN FOR ALL OF THESE AND IF YOU'RE WORKING WITH TWENTY FOUR THIRTY PARTNERS AND EVERYBODY HAS A DIFFERENT PRIORITY ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE GOOD INTENTIONS BUT WE HAVE A VERY HARD TIME NAVIGATING AND PARTICULARLY THE- ONCE THAT. ULTIMATELY ARE EITHER GOING TO BE APPLYING AND THE COUNTIES IN HAVING TO IMPLEMENT SO HAVING ONE- BASE FOR SOMEBODY TO INTERACT I GUESS MY ONLY MAJOR QUESTION WOULD BE. IF PASSED HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET ALL OF THESE AGENCIES TOGETHER AND- NOT CREATE ANOTHER- IF YOU WANT TO SAY- INSTITUTION- BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THAT WE WANT TO. WE WANT TO HAVE A FOCUS BUT WE WANT I WANT TO KEEP AT DOLLARS INTO ADMINISTRATION WE WANT TO GET THOSE DOLLARS OUT TO. THE SHELL. OR FOR THAT BUILDING I DON'T. KNOW I AM I THINK THAT BIAS BY CREATING ONE OFFICE ONE ESPECIALLY WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE- IT WOULD ACTUALLY UP STREAMLINE THE DELIVERY OF SERVICES AND LIKE LIKE I SAID EARLIER THEY'RE CURRENTLY THIRTEEN DIFFERENT AGENCIES THAT RUN THIRTY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS RIGHT AND- I THINK WE- VALUE WAIT. THIS AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE UP TO THE SECRETARY ON THAT I'M PROPOSING. OTHER COMMENTS MISTER GORE. READING JUST COMMON APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WITH US FOR OFFERING THIS LEGISLATION I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT STAFF ANALYSIS THE LIVE EXPLAINS CLEARLY THAT THE GOVERNOR COULD DO THAT EIGHT DOLLARS OFF SWITCH IT ON THEIR OWN I DON'T THINK IS A WITH THE LEDGES. WE WOULD LIKE. THIS BUT THAT IS THAT YOUR ON THIS ISSUE FOR MANY YEARS WELL THE PLACES WHERE WE'VE SEEN TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE ON HOW. STRONG EXACT YOUR SHIP A MATTER OF REALLY BRINGING EVERYONE TO GO THERE AND HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE ONLINE WHAT MICHAEL WAS JUST TOO MANY MORE THAN. ON THE TICKET RIGHT. PASSED LIKE THE SITUATION. BECAUSE OF THE CITY FUNDING GREATER ACCOUNT OF TRANCE BY EXECUTIVE BRANCH I THINK IS A STRATEGY HAS BEEN USED SUCCESSFULLY IN CITIES ACROSS THE NATION I'D LOVE TO RIGHT HERE AT THE STATE AND WEBER CALIFORNIA TO LEAVE MATTER SO. THIS BILL IF I'M HAPPY. WITH THE BILL. AND HOPE RECEIPT SAYS A SUBJECT A XIN AS RECOMMENDED AND IN MY WITH THAT'S ACROSS NATION. YOU MISTER LARA. MR GOOD MORNING SO I WANTED LINES I MEAN THE GOVERNOR SOME STATEMENT ALONG THE LINES OF I AM THE HOMELESS ARE FOR CALIFORNIA- SO DOES KINDA JIVIN WITH THAT STATEMENT I THINK THAT ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S DOT THAT'S BEEN ENCOURAGING IS HE'S REALLY TAKEN OWNERSHIP. THE ISSUE. WELL SURE. COUNTY OKAY WE HAVE A ALMOST NAY SO I IT'S NOT REALLY OUR ISSUE ANYMORE YOU KNOW GOVERNOR THEN HAS BEEN AN IN HOMELESS YES AND I THINK THAT. CONTRADICT HIS STATEMENT I THINK I'M PART OF BEING A LEADER IS THEN APPOINTEE AND SOMEONE AT THE EXECUTIVE LEVEL. TO OVERSEE THIS ISSUE. AND I THINK IT WOULD MAKE IT A LOT MORE IMPORTANT. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR- YOUR ENGAGEMENT YOUR DEEP ENGAGEMENT ON THIS- THIS IS A TOPIC WE TALKED ABOUT FOR. A NUMBER OF THE PROJECT OR WORK WITH OUR STAFF. TO APPRECIATE THE WORK OF AB IT'S HONEST. TO SUPPORT IT UP. FOR I THINK THE FACT IT. OF THIRD CHEN SEES RUNNING A THIRTY PROGRAMS SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE AND TO. MR ALI'S POINT. I'VE EVEN FORGOTTEN. SELF THIS AS PROMISES ARE I DO THINK THIS KIND OF A BILL COULD PROVIDE THE FRAZIER PARK A TO HELP HIM PUSH ALL OF OUR- GOALS AND OBJECTIVES. YOU KNOW FOR MY PERSPECTIVE THERE ARE AT LEAST THREE THINGS WE NEED TO MOVE THINGS FOR WHEN IT COMES TO HOMELESSNESS WHY THE FIGURE OUT. MEDICAL FUND THE- WORKING WITH SOME THE BILL TO SESUAI THAT. THE GAP IS MOVING FORWARD. SECONDLY I THINK AS MR GLORIA SAID WE REALLY NEED TO ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY AND WE ARE DOING. FORTY BEING DONE ON THAT FRONT. IMPORTANTLY AS FAR IN ANY CASE BUT HE IS FRANKLY STREAMLINING WHAT WE'VE GOT AND I THINK THIS BILL SQUARELY THIS IS THAT IN MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO ME SO HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE WORD. AND THE LESS THERE ARE COMMON WOULD LIKE TO ASK. I'M FOR THE DISCUSSION TODAY. YOU KNOW AB EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE IS JUST COMMON SENSE LIKE MANY OF YOU HAVE SAID TO SAY. WE CAN'T CAN YOU.
