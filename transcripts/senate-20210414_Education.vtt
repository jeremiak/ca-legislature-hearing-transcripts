MANDATE ANY POPULATION QUOTAS

00:41:02.693 --> 00:41:04.829

FUNDAMENTALLY LEASES I READ

01:26:32.987 --> 01:26:35.823
ANALYSIS ALL THE BILL DOES IS

01:26:35.890 --> 01:26:38.393
IT SAYS THAT- WE REMOVE AN

01:26:38.459 --> 01:26:40.929
EXCEPTION TO. SEX

01:26:40.995 --> 01:26:43.598
DISCRIMINATION PROVISIONS. WHAT

01:26:43.665 --> 01:26:45.867
YOU THINK INHERENTLY WHY WE

01:26:45.934 --> 01:26:46.401
CREATING EXCEPTIONS IN THE

01:26:46.467 --> 01:26:48.102

THE PROGRAM LIKE SELF

01:26:51.306 --> 01:26:54.375
DESTRUCTOR AND BUT TO ME THE-

01:26:54.442 --> 01:26:56.377
WHY WOULD THAT BE THE CASE I'M

01:26:56.444 --> 01:26:58.313
NOT SURE I'M CONNECTING. I

01:26:58.379 --> 01:27:00.014

01:27:00.081 --> 01:27:02.350
FOR PARITY- I WOULD MAKE NOTE

01:27:02.417 --> 01:27:04.519
THAT EVEN THE OPPOSITION I MEAN

01:27:04.586 --> 01:27:05.954
PEOPLE POINTED OUT THEY ARE

01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:07.522
SPONSORED BY DIFFERENT

01:27:07.589 --> 01:27:09.924
ORGANIZATIONS AND SO FORTH SO.

01:27:09.991 --> 01:27:11.025
EACH ORGANIZATION DESIGNED

01:27:11.092 --> 01:27:12.927
AROUND PROGRAM BUT THIS WOULD

01:27:12.994 --> 01:27:14.028
TO ME WHAT THIS WOULD ALLOW AND

01:27:14.095 --> 01:27:15.797
MAYBE AGAIN IF I GOT A WRONG

01:27:15.863 --> 01:27:17.532
SOMEONE EXPLAINED TO ME THAT IF

01:27:17.599 --> 01:27:18.967
A GIRL DECIDES THEY WANT TO GO

01:27:19.033 --> 01:27:20.034
TO VOICE BECAUSE THEY GOT A

01:27:20.101 --> 01:27:23.137
BETTER PROGRAM THAN. THEY CAN'T

01:27:23.204 --> 01:27:23.738
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE GIRLS

01:27:23.805 --> 01:27:25.807
SO- WHETHER THEY WANT TO DO

01:27:25.873 --> 01:27:27.508
PARITY ARE NOT TWO SEPARATE

01:27:27.575 --> 01:27:28.343
ORGANIZATIONS TO SEPARATE

DECIDE WHICH PROGRAM THEY GO TO

01:27:37.518 --> 01:27:38.586
IF THEY'RE IF THEY'RE GONNA

01:27:38.653 --> 01:27:40.021
PERSISTENT HAVING DIFFERENCES.

01:27:40.088 --> 01:27:41.489

01:27:41.556 --> 01:27:42.657
CREATING EXEMPTIONS IN THE

01:27:42.724 --> 01:27:44.425
FIRST PLACE TO DISCRIMINATION

01:27:44.492 --> 01:27:47.261

REASON WHY WE ARE ASKING FOR

01:30:25.486 --> 01:30:27.288

01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:10.337
NOT BELIEVE THAT IT IS A

01:35:10.404 --> 01:35:11.605
CRITICAL COMPONENT TO THE

01:35:11.672 --> 01:35:14.708

ADDED- WITHIN THE LAST TEN

01:35:19.547 --> 01:35:20.748
YEARS AND IT WAS ADDED BECAUSE

01:35:20.815 --> 01:35:23.284
AS WE HAD A NUMBER OF GIRLS WHO

01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:24.085
WERE DROPPING OUT OF THE

01:35:24.151 --> 01:35:27.088

WAS ALLOWING US. TO HAVE THE

01:35:30.391 --> 01:35:32.760
DELEGATES HAVE- AND SKIN IN THE

01:35:32.827 --> 01:35:34.161
GAME IF YOU WOULD SAY SO THAT

01:35:34.228 --> 01:35:35.463
THEY WOULD NOT DROP OUT OF THE

01:35:35.529 --> 01:35:37.932
PROGRAM AND NOT ALLOW US TO SEE

01:35:37.998 --> 01:35:39.533
COULD DELEGATE. AND ALTERNATE

01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:41.402
IN THE CORRECT AMOUNT OF TIME.

01:35:41.469 --> 01:35:42.336
AND THAT IS DEFINITELY

01:35:42.403 --> 01:35:43.737
SOMETHING THAT WE ARE WILLING

01:35:43.804 --> 01:35:45.940
TO LOOK AT WITH THE AUTHOR AND

01:35:46.006 --> 01:35:47.641
TO REMOVE. THE WHY WHEN YOU

01:35:47.708 --> 01:35:49.743

01:35:56.817 --> 01:35:57.952

01:37:28.442 --> 01:37:30.778
THAT COULD. CREATE THAT AT THAT

01:37:30.844 --> 01:37:32.513
COULD REMOVE THE DISCRIMINATION

01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:34.949
WHILE STILL ALLOWING ACCESS TO

01:37:35.015 --> 01:37:38.319

JUST. LAST PIECE OF STEAK- AND

01:37:42.890 --> 01:37:45.359
ALL LOOK TO THE CHAIR IS I

01:37:45.426 --> 01:37:46.293
DON'T THINK IT SHOULD TAKE

01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:47.761
LEGISLATION TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

01:37:47.828 --> 01:37:49.697
COMMON SENSE CHANGES TO ENSURE

01:37:49.763 --> 01:37:51.632
THAT THERE'S COMMONSENSE EQUITY

01:37:51.699 --> 01:37:53.400
BETWEEN. MEN AND WOMEN IN

01:37:53.467 --> 01:37:55.936
SOCIETY AND BEING COMPLETELY

01:37:56.003 --> 01:37:57.705
HONEST ABOUT THIS THE ONLY

01:37:57.771 --> 01:37:58.572
REASON WHY WE'RE HAVING THIS

01:37:58.639 --> 01:37:59.907
CONVERSATION ABOUT POTENTIAL

01:37:59.974 --> 01:38:01.242
CHANGES CAN BECOME INTEGRAL

01:38:01.308 --> 01:38:03.010
STATE. IS BECAUSE CENTER LEYVA

HAS INTRODUCED THIS LEGISLATION

01:38:04.812 --> 01:38:07.314
AND IS PUT A SPOTLIGHT ON THE

01:38:07.381 --> 01:38:10.317
INEQUITIES THAT CURRENTLY EXIST

01:38:10.384 --> 01:38:12.519
THAT'S IT. AND SO RATHER THAN

01:38:12.586 --> 01:38:14.888
OPPOSED TO LEGISLATION. WHERE

01:38:14.955 --> 01:38:16.023

01:38:16.090 --> 01:38:19.126
STATE OPPOSING THE LEGISLATION.

01:38:19.193 --> 01:38:20.728
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT IF

01:38:23.097 --> 01:38:24.732

01:40:00.294 --> 01:40:02.396
OF A DAUGHTER WHO ATTENDED BY

01:40:02.463 --> 01:40:05.165
CURE SIGNS THE ALL STATE GIRLS

01:40:05.232 --> 01:40:06.900
PROGRAM. IT WAS A VERY POSITIVE

01:40:06.967 --> 01:40:08.369
EXPERIENCE FOR MY DAUGHTER I

01:40:08.435 --> 01:40:10.871
KNOW THAT HER CONCERN WITH THE

01:40:10.938 --> 01:40:12.005
PROBE WAS THE FACT THAT SHE WAS

01:40:12.072 --> 01:40:14.475
NOT ABLE TO ATTEND- OR GO TO

01:40:14.541 --> 01:40:16.543
SACRAMENTO SO THAT WAS THERE.

01:40:16.610 --> 01:40:17.511
HER BIGGEST COMPLAINT WITH THE

01:40:17.578 --> 01:40:20.981
PROGRAM- WHEN SHE ATTENDED AND

01:40:21.048 --> 01:40:22.316
IT REALIZED AFTERWARDS THAT

01:40:22.383 --> 01:40:23.884
THERE HER COUNTERPARTS HAD HAD

01:40:23.951 --> 01:40:26.587
THE OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND

01:40:26.653 --> 01:40:28.789
SACRAMENTO THAT WAS HER CONCERN-

01:40:28.856 --> 01:40:30.557
THE OTHER THING WITH THE FEES I

01:40:30.624 --> 01:40:31.492
DID WANT TO MENTION THE FACT

01:40:31.558 --> 01:40:33.727
THAT- FOR THE MOST PART THESE

01:40:33.794 --> 01:40:35.295
ARE VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATIONS.

01:40:35.362 --> 01:40:37.664
AND THE WAY THAT MY DAUGHTER

01:40:37.731 --> 01:40:39.299
WAS SELECTED ACTUALLY I MOVED

01:40:39.366 --> 01:40:41.135
TO A SCHOLARSHIP- IN ORDER FOR

01:40:41.201 --> 01:40:42.302
HER TO BE ABLE TO ATTEND THE

01:40:42.369 --> 01:40:43.904
SAID THOSE FEES WERE. PROVIDED

01:40:43.971 --> 01:40:46.974
HER WERE PROVIDED TO HER BY

01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:49.410
EIGHTY. I BELIEVE. NIGHT OF

01:40:49.476 --> 01:40:50.444
PROBABLY SHOULDN'T SAY BECAUSE

01:40:50.511 --> 01:40:52.246
I'M NOT 1100% BUT IT WAS ONE OF

01:40:52.312 --> 01:40:54.114
THE SERVICE CLUBS ORGANIZATIONS

01:40:54.181 --> 01:40:55.816

PARTNERSHIP WITH THE

01:41:02.489 --> 01:41:04.124
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ACTUALLY-

01:41:04.191 --> 01:41:05.859
PROVIDE THIS PROGRAM. ON THERE

01:41:05.926 --> 01:41:07.528
SO I JUST WANT TO STATE THAT

01:41:07.594 --> 01:41:08.662
THAT MANY OF THESE GIRLS DO AT

01:41:08.729 --> 01:41:11.432

IN THE AREA. AND ALSO ANOTHER

01:41:23.177 --> 01:41:24.678
OBSERVATION THAT I WANTED TO

01:41:24.745 --> 01:41:26.613
THE STATE WAS THAT- THIS

01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:28.415
ORGANIZATIONS OR THESE PROGRAMS

01:41:28.482 --> 01:41:30.284

MANY. WOMEN AND- AND I HAVE TO

01:41:42.162 --> 01:41:43.330
AND I'M TRYING TO FIND THE

01:41:43.397 --> 01:41:45.632
PROPER WAY OF- PRESENTING THIS

01:41:45.699 --> 01:41:49.369
FLOOD OF OLDER WISER WOMEN. WHO

01:41:49.436 --> 01:41:52.973
ARE AT TRYING TO CONTINUE A

01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:55.275
PROGRAMMER A LEGACY THAT HAS

01:41:55.342 --> 01:41:56.643
BEEN IN PLACE IN TRYING TO

01:41:56.710 --> 01:41:58.579
PROMOTE WOMEN LEADERSHIP AND I

01:41:58.645 --> 01:42:00.147
DON'T THINK IT'S BEEN THE

01:42:00.214 --> 01:42:03.617
INTENT OF THESE- OF THESE WOMEN

01:42:03.684 --> 01:42:05.886
PROMOTING THIS LEGACY OF WOMEN

01:42:05.953 --> 01:42:07.421
LEADERSHIP TO HAVE BEEN ANY

01:42:07.488 --> 01:42:09.857
LESS THAN EQUAL OR EMPOWERING

01:42:09.923 --> 01:42:12.125
FOR WOMEN IT IS DONE HAS BEEN

01:42:12.192 --> 01:42:13.393
DONE AND GOOD WILL AND GOOD

01:42:13.460 --> 01:42:16.964
FAITH AND- AND AS- I HAVEN'T

01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:20.400
BEEN A PARENT WHO ATTENDED- ONE

01:42:20.467 --> 01:42:23.237
OF THE ONE OF THE LUNCHEONS-

01:42:23.303 --> 01:42:25.205
HONORING THE YOUNG GIRLS. I CAN

01:42:25.272 --> 01:42:26.406
TELL YOU THAT THESE WOMEN WERE

01:42:26.473 --> 01:42:28.141
ADAM ON RESPECTFUL AND HAD

01:42:28.208 --> 01:42:30.244
EVERY INTENT OF EMPOWERING AT

01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:33.614
WIDE ARRAY OF DIVERSE WOMEN-

01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:36.049
FROM AT DIFFERENT ECONOMIC

01:42:36.116 --> 01:42:38.752
BACKGROUNDS TO- ETHNIC

01:42:38.819 --> 01:42:40.220
BACKGROUNDS AND IT WAS AN

01:42:40.287 --> 01:42:42.422
INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE TO HAVE

01:42:42.489 --> 01:42:44.691
SEEN THESE YOUNG WOMEN- THAT

01:42:44.758 --> 01:42:45.993
WERE ATTENDING AS WELL AS

01:42:46.059 --> 01:42:47.427
MEETING THE WOMEN WHO ARE

01:42:47.494 --> 01:42:49.530
TRYING DESPERATELY TO KEEP A

01:42:49.596 --> 01:42:50.998
LIFE A PROGRAM OF CIVIC

01:42:51.064 --> 01:42:54.601
SERVICE. AND AND- ON A

01:42:54.668 --> 01:42:58.171
VOLUNTEER BASIS SO I DO HAVE A

01:42:58.238 --> 01:43:02.042
CONCERN THAT THIS WOULD IMPOSE-

01:43:02.109 --> 01:43:03.577
EXTRA BURDENS ON

01:43:03.644 --> 01:43:06.146
ADMINISTRATIVELY FOR OUR GIRLS

01:43:06.213 --> 01:43:09.283
NOT THAT IT DOESN'T MERIT D.

01:43:09.349 --> 01:43:12.686
THE INTENT OF HAVE BEEN WANTING

TO WORK TOWARDS THAT AIM AND

01:43:14.821 --> 01:43:18.358
GOAL BUT I THINK- IT WITH EVERY

01:43:18.425 --> 01:43:19.426
ORGANIZATION ESPECIALLY A

01:43:19.493 --> 01:43:22.829
SERVICE VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATION-

01:43:22.896 --> 01:43:24.498
PEOPLE HAVE TO WORK WITHIN THE

01:43:24.565 --> 01:43:25.799
MEANS THAT THEY HAVE IN THE

01:43:25.866 --> 01:43:27.301

01:43:29.069 --> 01:43:30.504
HARD TO COME BY I THINK WE'VE

01:43:30.571 --> 01:43:33.407
ALL NOTE NOTED. THE THE

01:43:33.473 --> 01:43:34.608
STATISTICS IN THE DATA THAT

01:43:34.675 --> 01:43:35.876

01:43:35.943 --> 01:43:37.945
ORGANIZATIONS ARE ESPECIALLY

01:43:38.011 --> 01:43:40.647
OLDER ONES ARE BASICALLY DYING

01:43:40.714 --> 01:43:41.949

01:43:42.015 --> 01:43:44.184
IN IN ESSENCE AND AN IMPORTANT

01:43:44.251 --> 01:43:46.119
PART OF OUR OUR OUR OUR

01:43:46.186 --> 01:43:48.188

01:43:48.956 --> 01:43:53.860

THAT PARITY I THINK- THE-

01:44:37.938 --> 01:44:40.040
DOCTOR. MCKINNEY DID MENTION

01:44:40.107 --> 01:44:41.541
THE FACT THAT THEY HAD ALREADY

01:44:41.608 --> 01:44:42.909
IN PLACE SOME OF THE THINGS

01:44:42.976 --> 01:44:44.344
THAT THEY HAD BEEN BRINGING

01:44:44.411 --> 01:44:46.380
FORTH. IN ORDER TO BRING MORE

01:44:46.446 --> 01:44:49.216
PARITY INTO THE PROGRAM- PRIOR

01:44:49.282 --> 01:44:50.717
TO SAID THIS IS JUST ANOTHER

01:44:50.784 --> 01:44:51.618
COMPONENT THAT THEY WERE

01:44:51.685 --> 01:44:54.254
WORKING ON- BUTTHEY HAVE HAD

02:42:49.626 --> 02:42:51.261

OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM. THE

02:43:10.947 --> 02:43:12.282

INDEPENDENT STUDY IS A BETTER

02:43:32.035 --> 02:43:33.537

OF WIDESPREAD SCHOOL CLOSURES.

02:43:50.120 --> 02:43:51.821
BUT THE SAME TRAITS THAT MAY

02:43:51.888 --> 02:43:53.356
MAKE NINE CLASSROOM BASED

02:43:53.423 --> 02:43:56.026

02:44:03.667 --> 02:44:05.101
DIFFICULT TO TRACK IN THE

02:44:05.168 --> 02:44:06.937

02:44:07.003 --> 02:44:09.239
OPERATE OUT OF A SINGLE

02:44:09.306 --> 02:44:10.907

02:44:10.974 --> 02:44:12.542

02:44:17.447 --> 02:44:18.682
THE MOST EGREGIOUS OF THESE

02:44:18.748 --> 02:44:20.784
CASES WAS THE A. THREE SCHOOL

02:44:32.295 --> 02:44:33.964
DID THIS BY CREATING FAKE

SENATE BILL FIVE NINETY THREE

AS IT WAS AMENDED LAST WEEK. WE

02:53:12.815 --> 02:53:13.816
RECENTLY ESTABLISHED A

SCHOOL THEIR CHILDREN INSTEAD

02:53:35.338 --> 02:53:37.106
AND ROLLING IN THE SCHOOL HAS

02:53:37.173 --> 02:53:38.975
BEEN USED AS A WAY TO

02:53:39.041 --> 02:53:40.676
SUPPLEMENT VACATION EXPENSES.

02:53:40.743 --> 02:53:43.513

THIS SCHEME OF THIS KIND OF

SENATE BILL FIVE NINETY THREE

02:53:59.362 --> 02:54:00.563

BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO CAPACITY

02:54:48.010 --> 02:54:49.879
TO DO OVERSIGHT IT POINTS OUT

02:54:49.946 --> 02:54:51.080
THAT THE SCHOOLS ARE COLLECTING

02:54:51.147 --> 02:54:52.515
THEIR OWN AUDITORS AND FIRING

02:54:52.582 --> 02:54:53.816

THE FUTURE AS IT CONTINUES IT

SHOULD BE AUDITED THAT'S MY

02:59:39.602 --> 02:59:41.971
FUNDAMENTAL FEELING. BUT WHAT I

02:59:42.037 --> 02:59:44.607
BACK TO MY INITIAL CONCERN AS

02:59:44.673 --> 02:59:49.145

QUALIFIED TO AUDIT I THINK I

03:00:09.231 --> 03:00:11.133
UNDERSTAND THE IDEA THERE IS

03:00:11.200 --> 03:00:13.769

CLASSROOMS AS QUICKLY AS

03:03:14.917 --> 03:03:15.451
POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF THE SENSE

03:03:15.517 --> 03:03:18.387
THAT. WHAT WE PART OF WHAT WE

03:03:18.454 --> 03:03:19.021
LEARNED DURING THIS PANDEMIC IS

03:03:19.088 --> 03:03:22.358
THAT. HE HE THE CUSTOMER

03:03:22.424 --> 03:03:24.793
DUCATION IS ABSOLUTELY

03:03:24.860 --> 03:03:26.562
NECESSARY IN A TO THE

IT NECESSARILY TO ADDRESS. THE

03:03:47.716 --> 03:03:49.785
ISSUE I THINK CTA BROUGHT UP-

03:03:49.852 --> 03:03:51.353
OR THE UP SOMEBODY ON THE

03:03:51.420 --> 03:03:52.121

GOING FOR IRAQ IN JUST IN THE

03:04:07.102 --> 03:04:09.505
BROADER CONTEXT OF NOT WANTING

MANY- DELIBERATIONS ON

03:05:07.196 --> 03:05:09.364
LEGISLATION IN THE SPACE NOT

03:05:09.431 --> 03:05:11.033
JUST IN THIS NARROW CATEGORY OF

03:05:11.099 --> 03:05:12.634
NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER

03:05:12.701 --> 03:05:14.403
COMPANY THE BROADER QUESTION

03:05:14.470 --> 03:05:17.439
INCLUDING THE MORATORIUM-

03:05:17.506 --> 03:05:19.241
INCLUDING- A VARIETY OF OTHER

03:05:19.308 --> 03:05:20.843
STANDARDS THAT ARE APPLIED OR

03:05:20.909 --> 03:05:23.312
DON'T APPLY SO. IT IS A ROBUST

03:05:23.378 --> 03:05:24.313
DEBATE THAT WE DO HAVE IN THE

03:05:24.379 --> 03:05:26.915
SPACE KEEP IN MIND THAT- NOT

03:05:26.982 --> 03:05:27.749
CLASSROOM BASED CHARTERS THAT

03:05:29.885 --> 03:05:32.521
CATEGORY THE 220% ARE OUTSIDE

03:05:32.588 --> 03:05:34.356
THE CLASSROOM NOT NOT WHAT

03:05:34.423 --> 03:05:35.891
WE'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING- HERE

03:05:35.958 --> 03:05:37.860
IN THE PANDEMIC IN MOST CASES

03:05:37.926 --> 03:05:39.495
SO IT'S A IT'S A NARROWER FRAME

03:05:39.561 --> 03:05:41.396
AND EVEN MORE SO IN TERMS OF

03:05:41.463 --> 03:05:43.765
HOW IT'S DEFINED. SO LOOK AT IT

03:05:43.832 --> 03:05:44.867
THIS THAT IT I THINK YOUR

03:05:44.933 --> 03:05:46.468
QUESTION DOES MOVE INTO THIS

03:05:46.535 --> 03:05:48.070
BROADER SPACE OF A PUBLIC

03:05:48.136 --> 03:05:49.805
CHARTERS AND DAY AND THE ROLE

03:05:49.872 --> 03:05:51.473
THAT THEY PLAY AND THE CHOICES

03:05:51.540 --> 03:05:53.308
THAT THEY PROVIDE- OR SHOULD

03:05:53.375 --> 03:05:58.647
SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT PROVIDE.

03:05:58.714 --> 03:05:59.748
TO THE PARENT COMMUNITY- IT. I

03:05:59.815 --> 03:06:00.716
TRYING TO STAY PUT ON THIS

03:06:00.782 --> 03:06:03.452
NARROWS- THE I THINK THAT WE

03:06:03.519 --> 03:06:04.720
WILL AT AT MY GUESS IS THIS

03:06:04.786 --> 03:06:06.121
COMMITTEE WILL HEAR BILLS THAT

03:06:06.188 --> 03:06:07.656
WOULD GO FURTHER THAN. WHAT YOU

03:06:07.723 --> 03:06:08.757
HAVE BEFORE YOU WHEN OTHER

03:06:08.824 --> 03:06:10.158
THINGS THAT SHOULD BE DONE THAT

03:06:10.225 --> 03:06:11.226
MANY PEOPLE SHOULD BE DONE AND

03:06:11.293 --> 03:06:12.828
OTHER PEOPLE THINK. ART SHOULD

03:06:12.895 --> 03:06:14.096
NOT BE DONE I THINK YU YOU

03:06:14.162 --> 03:06:15.898

BILLS IN POINTS OF DEBATE IN

03:06:20.168 --> 03:06:21.837
THE SPACE BUT FOR ME AT LEAST

03:06:21.904 --> 03:06:23.438
CENTER WITH RESPECT. I'M TRYING

03:06:23.505 --> 03:06:25.007
TO STAY THERE- WE'VE HAD THESE

03:06:25.073 --> 03:06:27.009
TERRIBLE ABUSES AND MAKES ALL

03:06:27.075 --> 03:06:30.112
OF US UPSET AND ANGRY. AND OUT

03:06:30.178 --> 03:06:31.613
TRY TO BE VERY RESPONSIVE TO

03:06:31.680 --> 03:06:32.514
WHAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY HAS

03:06:32.581 --> 03:06:34.349
SAID OUR REFORMS THAT WOULD TRY

03:06:34.416 --> 03:06:35.584
TO PREVENT THIS IS NOT AND

03:06:35.651 --> 03:06:37.486
MATTER. OF MAKE IT ANY EASIER

03:06:37.553 --> 03:06:38.620
WE ACTUALLY WANT TO TRY TO STOP

03:06:38.687 --> 03:06:39.621
IT THAT'S WHAT THE BILL IS

03:06:39.688 --> 03:06:40.756
NARROWLY TAILORED TO TRY TO

03:06:40.822 --> 03:06:42.157
DEAL WITH THE EXACT ABUSES THAT

03:06:42.224 --> 03:06:43.492
OCCURRED IN THIS CASE.

03:06:43.559 --> 03:06:44.726
HOPEFULLY THAT HELPS IN

03:06:44.793 --> 03:06:46.428
RESPONSE I KNOW IT'S NOT. THE

03:06:46.495 --> 03:06:47.629
BROADER QUESTION THAT YOU HAVE

03:06:47.696 --> 03:06:49.665
REYES BUT IT AT LEAST CLOSE TO

03:06:49.731 --> 03:06:51.400
MY FOCUS IN THIS BILL. THE NEW

03:06:51.466 --> 03:06:53.468
IT JUST ONE MORE A QUICK

03:06:53.535 --> 03:06:55.938
COMMENT AND ONE MORE QUESTION-

03:06:56.004 --> 03:06:56.538
MADAM CHAIR AND THEN ALL. OF

03:06:56.605 --> 03:06:59.308
THEM. WE'LL SEE THE FOR- A AND

03:06:59.374 --> 03:07:00.909
I JUST I WANNA MAKE IT CLEAR

03:07:00.976 --> 03:07:04.012
THAT WHERE I'M COMING FROM HIS.

03:07:04.079 --> 03:07:05.981
OF A LONG WAY BACK AS SOMEBODY

03:07:06.048 --> 03:07:09.017
WHO WAS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER.

03:07:09.084 --> 03:07:10.919
HIMSELF IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO.

03:07:10.986 --> 03:07:13.155
WHEN CHARTERED WHEN THE CHARTER

03:07:13.221 --> 03:07:13.922
LEGISLATION WAS ENACTED

03:07:13.989 --> 03:07:19.461
ORIGINALLY. IN. IT THE

03:07:19.528 --> 03:07:21.463
LEGISLATION WAS. WAS OSTENSIBLY

03:07:21.530 --> 03:07:23.532
WITH THE INTENT TO INFORM

03:07:23.599 --> 03:07:27.002
PRODUCTIVE CHANGE IN THE

03:07:27.069 --> 03:07:29.104
OVERALL PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM

03:07:29.171 --> 03:07:30.973
AND SO ANYTIME I LOOK AT WHAT

03:07:31.039 --> 03:07:32.808
HE THE CHARTER IS DOING TO THIS

03:07:32.874 --> 03:07:34.743
DAY ALL THESE YEARS LATER I ASK

03:07:34.810 --> 03:07:36.478
MYSELF THE QUESTION ARE THEY

03:07:36.545 --> 03:07:38.547
DOING SOMETHING THAT INFORMS

03:07:38.614 --> 03:07:39.881
PRODUCTIVE CHANGE IN OUR

03:07:39.948 --> 03:07:41.917
OVERALL PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM

03:07:41.984 --> 03:07:43.251
IN SO THAT'S WHY RAISE THE

03:07:43.318 --> 03:07:46.588
BROADER ISSUE BECAUSE- AUDIT.

03:07:46.655 --> 03:07:47.956
WELL THEY'RE IN BUSINESS GREAT

03:07:48.023 --> 03:07:50.192
BUT I JUST WANT US I JUST

03:07:50.258 --> 03:07:51.860
WANTED TO PUT ON THE RECORD I'M

03:07:51.927 --> 03:07:54.029
NOT CONVINCED THAT THE MODEL.

03:07:54.096 --> 03:07:55.163
ESPECIALLY AFTER WHAT WE

03:07:55.230 --> 03:07:57.065
LEARNED OF THE PANDEMIC IS

03:07:57.132 --> 03:08:00.068
ACTUALLY INFORMING- THE KIND OF

03:08:00.135 --> 03:08:01.269
PRODUCTIVE CHANGE IN THE

03:08:01.336 --> 03:08:03.205
OVERALL PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM

03:08:03.271 --> 03:08:04.806
THAT. THE CHARTERS WERE

03:08:04.873 --> 03:08:05.741
INTENDED TO DO IN THE FIRST

03:08:05.807 --> 03:08:08.176
PLACE THAT WE MAY OR MAY NOT

03:08:08.243 --> 03:08:09.878
DISAGREE OR AGREE ON THAT AND

03:08:09.945 --> 03:08:11.513
THEN THAT'LL PROBABLY UNTIL

03:08:11.580 --> 03:08:16.685
ITSELF LATER- LAST QUESTION-

03:08:16.752 --> 03:08:20.956

MANAGER AND I APOLOGIZE FOR

03:08:38.473 --> 03:08:39.541
THAT AND THERE WAS ONE MORE

03:08:39.608 --> 03:08:41.710
PARTICULAR VERY SPECIFIC ISSUE

03:08:41.777 --> 03:08:42.244
WITH THE BILL IS CONCERNED

03:08:42.310 --> 03:08:44.446
ABOUT AND PERHAPS IF I CAN

ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT

03:09:05.500 --> 03:09:08.470
HAPPENED BUT I GUESS. MY POINT

03:09:08.537 --> 03:09:10.038
IS THIS IS A PRETTY NARROW BILL

03:09:10.105 --> 03:09:11.073
THIS IS DEALING WITH THE

03:09:11.139 --> 03:09:13.608
AUDITING AND- I THINK IT'S THAT

03:09:13.675 --> 03:09:15.977
THAT'S ALSO NOTED IN ALICE'S-

03:09:16.044 --> 03:09:18.547
AND- WELL MAYBE A MORE RIGOROUS

03:09:18.613 --> 03:09:22.384
AUDIT SYSTEM MAY. HAVE PICKED

03:09:22.451 --> 03:09:24.486
UP THIS FRAUD EARLIER- I DO

03:09:24.553 --> 03:09:26.855
FEEL THERE ARE OTHER RECOMMEND-

03:09:26.922 --> 03:09:30.058
ISSUES THAT. REVEALED IN IN THE

03:09:30.125 --> 03:09:31.093
CASE AND NOT ONLY THIS CASE BUT

03:09:31.159 --> 03:09:32.861
OTHERS IN TERMS OF STUDENT DATA

03:09:32.928 --> 03:09:34.930
TRACKING OR DID YOU KNOW THE

03:09:34.996 --> 03:09:36.031
FACT THAT WE HAVE THESE LITTLE

03:09:36.098 --> 03:09:38.166
SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHO ARE DOING

03:09:38.233 --> 03:09:40.569
THE AUTHORIZATION. ZERO TEN

03:09:40.635 --> 03:09:42.537
ONLY TO FOCUS ON AUDITING OUR

03:09:42.604 --> 03:09:45.574
WAS AND THAT THAT'S WHAT'S-CURRENTLY IN THE BILL- DID DID

03:09:45.640 --> 03:09:47.275
THIS THIS IS THE ISSUES AROUND

03:09:47.342 --> 03:09:49.344
THE DATA TRACKING AND- THE

03:09:49.411 --> 03:09:51.379
CAPACITY OF THE AUTHORIZER TO

03:09:51.446 --> 03:09:53.081
ACTUALLY ASIDE FROM AUDITING

03:09:53.148 --> 03:09:54.983
MONITORED THE ACTIVITIES OF

03:09:55.050 --> 03:09:57.385
THESE- A CHURCH SCHOOLS IS THAT

03:09:57.452 --> 03:09:58.820
SOMETHING YOU VIEWS OUTSIDE THE

03:09:58.887 --> 03:10:00.388
PURVIEW OF WHAT YOU WANT TO TRY

03:10:00.455 --> 03:10:02.958
TO. THE COMPLETION OF THIS BILL

03:10:03.024 --> 03:10:05.227
AND LEAVE IT TO OTHERS- SO JUST

03:10:05.293 --> 03:10:07.462
