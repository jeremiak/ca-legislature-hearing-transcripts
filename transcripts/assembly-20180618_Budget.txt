THANK YOU THIS BILL PROPOSES VARIOUS STATUTORY CHANGES RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PROGRAM AND OTHER HEALTH PROGRAMS IN THAT PART. OF CARE SERVICES AND THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. I HAD THE PROVISIONS OF THE BELL ESTABLISHED THE DIVERSION FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL DISORDERS PROGRAM AN OPTIONAL FELONY OR MISDEMEANOR PRETRIAL COUNTY DAY VERSION PROGRAM. THAT ALLOWS LOCAL ENTITIES TO COLLABORATE WITH COURTS TO DIVERT DEFENDANTS WITH MENTAL DISORDERS FROM THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM INTO COMMUNITY TREATMENT. THIS TRAILER BILL ALSO CREATE THE COUNCIL ON HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS AN INDEPENDENT BODY TO DEVELOP A PLAN WITH OPTIONS FOR ACHIEVING A HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL ALSO CONTAINS -- OR ALLOWS FOR THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT TO CONVENE A REVIEW COMMITTEE COMPOSED OF SEVEN TO ELEVEN MEMBERS FROM THE HEALTH CARE FIELD TO DEVELOP AT RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE ESTABLISHMENT IMPLEMENTATION. AND ONGOING ADMINISTRATION OF A HEALTH CARE COST TRANSPARENCY DATABASE AND A PROVIDES THAT WOULD HAPPEN WITHIN THE SIXTY MILLION DOLLAR A ONE TIME GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION FOR THAT PURPOSE. THINKING THIS CONSTANT MR LIMITED. MR OUTSIDE A QUESTION ABOUT THE COUNCIL ON HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS SO YOU SAID THAT THEY ARE GONNA BE TASKED WITH -- A PLAN FOR ACHIEVING UNIVERSAL FINANCING FOR HEALTH CARE IN CALIFORNIA I'M WONDERING IS AT THE SAME DEBATE THAT WITH THE LEGISLATURE'S BEEN HAVING ABOUT SINGLE PAYER HEALTHCARE. AMERICA'S SECOND FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE HEALTHCARE COUNCIL'S INTENT IS TO STEP UP ITS ONE STEP TOWARDS THAT DIRECTION BUT THIS IS A MORE METHODICAL IN THAT OUR INTENT THIS LIKE. CONVENE THE CONCIL FURS AND SEE WHAT THE NEEDS ARE OUT THERE AND WHAT CHANGES WE SHOULD -- TAKE. OKAY WELL WE'RE ALL AWARE THAT THIS IS BUT A SUBJECT OF INTENSE DEBATE IN THE LEGISLATURE IN THE LAST YEAR AND I I JUST WANT. TO GO ON RECORD AS SAYING I THINK IT'S AN APPROPRIATE TO ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT BUT GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY TO ESSENTIALLY HAVE THE DEBATE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN HAVING I FIND THAT VERY PREMATURE. THANK YOU MS FOX. A COULD YOU CLARIFY WHO SERVES ON THIS COUNCIL. THE COUNCIL WILL BECOME PRICE OF FIVE MEMBERS AND A THREE WILL BE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR. ONE WILL BE APPOINTED BY THE SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY AND ONE WILL BE APPOINTED BY THE SENATE RULES ON COMMITTEE AND AMONG THEMSELVES THEY WILL RELATE IT ELECT A CHAIR. IS THERE CERTAIN CRITERIA THEY'LL BE USED TO A POINT. THAT IS YET TO BE OWN DETERMINE BUT WE DON'T HAVE IT IN THE STATUTE SPECIFIED. SO THE SO EXCEPT WHEN THEY'RE PROCESS THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE BODY AND THE GOVERNOR -- WITH CRITERIA STILL YET TO BE DEVELOPED. THANK YOU THE QUESTIONS. AS COOPER. I GOT IT MISTER CHAIR WAS WERE ON A FOUR FOUR YES. I DO HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT -- THE MIDDLE HEALTH ASPECT. IT WE JUST ALREADY AND I APOLOGIZE THOSE LATE. I BELIEVE YOU'RE REFERENCING THE PROVISION AYE REGARDING THE INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL. YEAH IT IN THIS MY QUESTION IS WELL OUT DIVERSION FOR SERIOUS ABOUT FELONIES. AND SEX OFFENSES. I COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS EVEN EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH THESE INDIVIDUALS. SB TWO FIFTEEN SETS UP THIS EXACT PROGRAM THE LIMIT IS TWO MISDEMEANORS. ELEVEN SEVENTY H. FELONIES. APARTMENT FINAL SOME SORT OF WHAT. SO WHILE THE DIVERSION FOR SERIOUS OR VIOLENT FELONIES AND SEX OFFENSES. IT IS A COUNTY COURT TO DO IS INDIVIDUALS. AT YES THEY ARE SO THE WAY THAT STRUCK THAT THE PROGRAM IS STRUCTURED IS IT GIVES THE COURTS THE DISCRETION -- TO MAKE A DETERMINATION WHETHER OR NOT THIS INDIVIDUAL IS. APPROPRIATE FOR PLACEMENT INTO THE COMMUNITY. SO PROGRESS INCLUDE LANGUAGE PROVIDING FOR VICTIM RESTITUTION EVEN IF SOMEONE RECEIVES DIVERSION. THE CURRENT CURRENTLY WRITTEN THE TRIBBLES NOT PROVIDE FOR VICTIMS TUITION. WHY IS THIS THIS IS A VIOLATION OF MARCY'S LAW? SO YOU'RE CORRECT THE THE LANGUAGE DOES NOT AT INCLUDE A HAM. RESTITUTION BUT THE LANGUAGE IS THE LANGUAGE IS CRAFTED TO BE CONSISTENT WITH OTHER DIVERSION PROGRAMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN STATUTE. THE VIOLATE MARCY'S LOS -- I MEAN I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION AND HELP. OKAY BUT THEN THE MY LAST QUESTION HER COUNTIES PREPARED TO BE. START DOING THIS TOMORROW OBVIOUSLY. SO THE PROGRAM THAT WAS DEVELOPED WAS -- TO ESSENTIALLY -- LEVERAGE THE EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT COUNTIES HAVE AVAILABLE SO THERE ARE A LOT OF COUNTIES COUNTIES IN WHICH THE PROGRAM WAS ATTENDED THIS ITEM. INTENDED -- TO PROBLEM. BE PLACED IN IS IS A LOT OF THEM HAVE MISDEMEANOR PROGRAMS IN PLACE SO IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO BEGIN DOING THIS -- BUT I WILL KNOW THAT THE FUNDING THAT SPECIFIC FOR THIS PROGRAM IS AVAILABLE OVER THREE YEARS TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY ARE NOT AVAILABLE. TO RAMP UP QUICKLY THAT THEY HAVE A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. TO UTILIZE THESE FUNDS CREATES A SCISSORS NO DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION IN THIS BILL IT TAKES EFFECT ISN'T OF SIGN. A SHOULD WE GIVE COLONEL JUSTICE SYSTEM STAKEHOLDERS TIME TO PREPARE FOR SUCH A MASSIVE SHIFT IN HOW WE PLAY TREAT MENTALLY ILL MURDERS. AND RAPES IN THE COMMUNITY. SO THEY WILL HAVE TIME TO DEVELOP PLANS AND SUBMIT THEM TO THE APARTMENT FOR IMPLEMENTATION. BUT THE BILL IS SINCE THE GOVERNOR SIGNED IT TAKES EFFECT THOUGH. SO IT MEANS NO LAG TIME SO YOU'RE CORRECT BUT THIS IS AN OPTIONAL PROGRAM FOR COUNTIES TO IMPLEMENT THIS IS NOT REQUIRED THANK YOU. BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY SEEN NONE I ANY MEMBERS OF PUBLIC CONSERVE PART OF S. B.. EIGHT FOUR FOUR BETH COMPELLING TO HAVE HEALTHAXIS CALIFORNIA WE ARE PLEASED TO SEE THE FUNDING FOR THE DATABASE WHICH WE WORKED ON FOR OVER A DECADE NOW SO TO SEE IT FUNDED IN THE CHANCE OF IT BEING OPERATIONAL -- IS A GOOD THING WE ALSO ARE -- DISAPPOINTED THAT THERE IS NOT FUNDING FOR EXPANDING COVERAGE BUT PLEASED TO SEE THE STEPS FORWARD TO FURTHER STUDY HOW TO GET TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. MISTER CHAIR JONATHAN LYMAN AND HAVE THE FACULTY ASSOCIATION CALTRAIN COMMUTE CONSCIOUS I'M WONDERING IF I COULD SPEAK ON THE HIGHER READ BECAUSE I HEARD YOU CALL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC FOR THE EDUCATION BILL BUT NOT THE HIGHER READ. IF THAT WOULD BE OKAY ABSOLUTE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- WE WANT TO EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION FOR MONEY FOR FULL AND PART TIME FACULTY AS WELL AS MENTAL HEALTH. AND THE ACADEMIC SENATE WITH THE FACULTY ASSOCIATION HEALTH WE COMMUNICATE JUST WANTS TO GO ON RECORD. AS SAYING THAT WE ARE VERY DISTRESSED. AT THE FACT THAT THE OF THE FINAL PRODUCT DOES NOT SUFFICIENTLY INCORPORATE. UP WHAT THE THE FINE WORK. BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE NEVER. TO ON THE OUR ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AS WELL AS THE FUNDING FORMULA THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. STINGER INDULGENCE MISTER CHAIR ON THE HIGHER ED. THE BILL OF CHRISTY BROWN WILL BE UP CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS EXTRAORDINARILY PLEASED WITH THE ONE TIME APPROPRIATION TO SUPPORT PASSED A PER SHIP OUR TRAINING. THAT WAS DELIVERED AND SOME OF THE REPORTING LANGUAGE CLARIFICATION WITH RESPECT TO THE CHANGE OF HOW. A PERSON COULD BE FUNDED UNDER OF TS AND SO WE JUST THANK YOU FOR YOUR INDULGENCE AND WE SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY OUR OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION. TO S. B.. EIGHT FOUR FOUR TIFFANY MATTHEWS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION. THERE'S ALREADY LEGISLATION IN THE SECOND HOUSE S. B.. TWO FIFTEEN THAT ADDRESSES THIS EXACT ISSUE AND REPRESENTS AN AGREEMENT BY STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. IT'S UNCLEAR WHY THIS POLICY NEEDS TO BE DONE THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS. WHAT WE SUPPORT THE IDEA OF DIVERSION? AIMED AT KEEPING WILL LEVEL MENTALLY ILL OFFENDERS OUT OF JAIL THIS BILL DOES NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY BECAUSE IT ALLOWS DIVERSION FOR ALL OFFENSES UP TO AND INCLUDING MURDER. BECAUSE THIS IS A TRAILER BILL. IT WOULD TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY UPON BEING SIGNED. COUNTIES AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM STAKEHOLDERS ARE NOT PREPARED FOR THIS DRASTIC CHANGE IN DEALING WITH THIS POPULATION. WE URGE THE IMPLEMENTATION BE DELAYED UNTIL AT LEAST JANUARY FIRST TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN LOOKING [inaudible] THANK YOU. NEITHER MEMBERS OF PUBLIC OPPOSED S. B. [inaudible] EIGHT FOUR FOUR OKAY. MOVING FORWARD S. B. EIGHT FOUR FIVE HUMAN SERVICES. THANK YOU THIS IS OUR HUMAN SERVICES OMNIBUS BILL INCLUDES SEVERAL PROVISIONS NOTABLY IT -- BUT IT INCLUDES THAT STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ELIMINATION OF THE CAST OUT CASH OUT POLICY FOR SSI THAT RESULTS IN APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED SIXTY NINE THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS. BECOME NEWLY ELIGIBLE FOR CAL FRESH BENEFITS AND FORTY FIVE THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS WOULD RECEIVE AN INCREASE AND CAL FRESH BENEFITS. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS TRAILER BILL ALSO INCREASE THE COWARDS MAXIMUM AID PAYMENT LEVELS BY TWENTY NINETEEN IT ALSO ESTABLISHES A COW WORKS HOME VISITATION PILOT PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES UP PREGNANT WOMEN AND FAMILIES WITH A CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF TWO WITH HOME VISITATION SERVICES. WITH PRIORITY GIVEN TO FIRST TIME PREGNANT WOMEN AND PARENTS THE PROGRAM PROVIDES FUNDING FOR COUNTIES TO CONTRACT THAT THE EXISTING EVIDENCE BASED HOME VISITING PROGRAMS. AND OR CREATE THEIR OWN EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS BUT THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF MISTRUST I TO QUESTION ABOUT THE PROVISION OF THIS TRAILER BILL THAT WOULD. ALLOW INDEPENDENT STUDY HOURS TO COUNT TOWARDS THE WELFARE TO WORK REQUIREMENT FOR CAL WORKS RECIPIENTS SO. CURRENT STATE LAW COUNTS CLASSROOM HOURS IN DEGREE GRANTING PROGRAMS AND CERTIFICATE GRANTING PROGRAMS. BUT I'M. WONDERING IF YOU HAVE ANY CONCERNS THAT ALLOWING SELF REPORTED INDEPENDENT STUDY HOURS TO COUNT WITH NO INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION MECHANISM. COULD RESULT IN GREATER FRAUD AND CAL WORKS. YEAH AND WOOD DEPARTMENT FINANCE WE DON'T HAVE ANY DATA TO SUGGEST THAT THAT WOULD OCCUR -- BUT MINOR SAYING THAT THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH OF WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE WHAT WE DID COUCH REFORM AND IN THE NINETIES. THIS ASSAY NOT ACCOUNTED -- FOR BUT TO OUR KNOWLEDGE WE DON'T THINK THAT THAT WOULD HAPPEN. OKAY SO IF A COUNTY THESE ARE SELF REPORTED NUMBERS THERE'S NO INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION SO FOR COUNTY. IN ADMINISTERING CAL WORKS WANTED TO CONTEST SOMETHING THAT WAS REPORTED HOW WOULD THEY GO ABOUT DOING THAT. MY CORPORATE GUY THE LOCALS GOOD IS A BETWEEN ECOLOGY OR TO ENSURE THAT THOSE INFORMATIONS THAT PROVIDER ACCURATE. I MEAN HOW WHAT THE COLLEGE NOTES SELF REPORTED BY THE RECIPIENT. I I THINK THE KEY THING IS THAT THIS IS YOU KNOW BUILT ON TRUST AND THAT THE CALVET INDIVIDUALS WOULD. DO IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR OTHER NEEDS TO ENSURE THAT YOU KNOW ALL THE HOURS THAT THERE. USING A STUDY. SHOULD WE CAN FOR AND PLUS AT BUT BUT THEN THE DAY THERE'S ONLY A MAXIMUM BOWERS TO SHOULD BE ACCOUNT FOR OVER THERE. IT'S NOT LIKE A REFINEMENT CORRECTLY IT'S A THREE HOURS ONLY. FOR PER CLASSES SO IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S A WIDE RANGE OF HOURS THAT YOU KNOW -- ANYBODY COULD ACCOUNT. FOR OKAY LEVEL LARGER CONCERN ABOUT THIS -- I THINK THAT PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF CAL WORKS IS VERY IMPORTANT AND I THINK THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO UNDERMINE THE PUBLIC'S TRUST AND CAL WORKS BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO POTENTIALLY INCREASING FRAUD -- IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO VERIFY SO I THAT I REAL PROBLEM WITH THAT PART OF THE TRAILER BILL THICKNESS MATHIS. MY MY QUESTION MY CONCERN OR ALONG THE SAME LINES HERE WELL. BUT YOU KNOW CAL WORKS IS GREAT PROGRAM DOES A LOT. FOR FOR A LOT OF FOLKS. MY QUESTION MORE SHOW IS YOU KNOW WHEN IT WHEN WE LOOK AT ACCREDITATION HOURS. YOU KNOW PART OF THAT WORKED INTO IT IS HOW LONG THE WHOLE WORK TAKES [inaudible] IN SO. SELF REPORTING UNIVERSES LOOKING AT HOW MUCH. YOU KNOW FROM TAKING A COURSE OR SOMETHING OF COURSE THAT'S GOING TO BE THREE CREDITS. THE HOMEWORK HOURS READ TYPICALLY WORKED INTO THAT I KNOW WE HAVE SOME PEOPLE -- ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE THAT ARE WITH HIGHER ED THOUGH TRY NO MORE THAN -- NINETY BULL WIRE WE LOOKING AT BASE UNIT OFF THE CREDIT HOURS FOR THE CREDITS TAKING AND GIVING THEM THE HALLMARK HOURS INVASION THEIR VERSES A SELF REPORTING. I'M SORRY SIR I'M NOT SURE QUITE SURE WILL TRY TO GET SO IN IN IN WHEN YOU TAKE A COLLEGE COURSE YOU CREATE EACH CREDITS WERE SO MANY HOURS. IN THE HOMEWORK IS INCLUDED IN THAT. WHY AREN'T WE TAKING THOSE HOURS? AND ADDING THAT. FOR FOR THE COLLEGE CREDIT. HOURS VERSES A SELF REPORTING HOMEWORK HOURS. THE BECAUSE THE HOMEWORK IS HIS. TIED INTO HOW MANY. HOURS THAT CREDITS WORTH. SO WHAT ARE YOU BASING IT OFF OF THE CREDITS TAKING IN AND HOW MUCH. HOME WORK HOURS IS ACCUMULATED WITH THE CREDITS VERSES A SELF REPORTING. I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT HOURS THAT ARE YOU THAT COULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR THIS A FINER CORRECTLY IT'S NOT LIKE THAT IT'S IT'S ONLY THREE HOURS SO FOR PER CLASSES BUT OUT THE COME BACK. NOW GET YOUR STAFF THE PROPER INFORMATION -- BUT IT'S NOT LIKE. IT'S ON AS THOUGH ANYBODY COULD TO SAY THAT I'VE DONE AND OUR TEN HOURS WORTH OF PER WEEK FOR UPPER CLASS THERE IS THE LIMIT THAT THEY COULD BE ACCOUNT TOWARD. THEIR WORK AROUND WHAT PLANTS SO. BUT THEN THE DAY THERE IS A LIMIT NOBODY CAN GO UP THERE AND SAY THAT -- THIS WHOLE WEEK I SPENT YOU KNOW BURKE AND STUDY JUST FOR THIS CLASS AND THERE'S A MAXIMUM HOURS I COULD BE COUNT WITH A WORK PLAN AYE I BRING IT UP BECAUSE IT I MEAN THERE WE WE HAVE A SOLID WAY OF COUNTING. HOURS PER CREDIT IN AND HOW MUCH HOMEWORK IS ASSIGNED TO THAT. SO A AS A STATE IT JUST RAISES THE QUESTION WHY WE ARE LOOKING AT YOU KNOW IF IF A STUDENT TAKING SO MANY CREDITS. THOSE CREDITS WERE EQUAL TO A CERTAIN NUMBER OF HOURS. SO WHY WOULD WE BE BASED ON A SYSTEM OFF OF SOMETHING THAT WE KNOW. IT OUR RD HAS AN EQUATION VERSES A SELF REPORTING BACK. THAT WAY THERE'S CLARITY IN THERE THEN THERE IS A CONCERN FOR FRAUD. THAN WE ALREADY HAVE IT BASED AND AND THAT WITH OUR STUDENTS ARE ACTUALLY GETTING THE FULL HOURS. THEY SHOULD BE GETTING OF FOR THE PROGRAM VERSES -- ELIMINATES LIKE YOU SAID THREE HOURS. YOU KNOW THREE HOURS FOR ONE CLASS IS DIFFERENT THAN THREE HOURS FOR ANOTHER CLASS. LET ME THAT SOMETHING THAT WOULD LOOK INTO AS FOR IMPLEMENTING US WITH THE COUNTY AS YOU KNOW WITH PARTS OF RESOURCES AND CONCERNS IT'S MY AMP. TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT YEAH YEAH IT IS AUTOMATICALLY BRINGS OF THE CONCERN THAT YOU KNOW NEXT RIGHT AFTER AND CLEAN UP LANGUAGE TO FIX THIS. SO YOU KNOW MY AND MY OTHER CONCERN TO USE EXCESSIVE MY DISTRICT AND WE'RE WE'RE A 56% MEDI CAL A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE ALSO USING CAL WORKS OF SOMETHING THAT TO TO GIVE AYE AND BETTER THEMSELVES. SO YOU KNOW TO MAKE SURE MY PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO GET THE HOURS THE DESERVE. BUT ALSO YOU KNOW WE HAVE THAT HALF CAN. FRAUD BY BASING IT OFF OF THE SYSTEM. THE TARDY THERE. I IN OF A CHARACTER'S PERMANENT SUPPOSED TO HELP FOLKS BECOME SELF SUFFICIENT AND AT AN ABSOLUTE I'VE A LOT OF FRIENDS AND FAMILY THEY'VE USED IT. WHICH IS WHY MY CONCERN IN THIS IS WHERE WE MAKING SURE THEY'RE GETTING THE HOURS THAT THEIR DO VERSES. YOU KNOW SOME SELF REPORTING MECHANISM THIS IS GONNA COST TURMOIL. AND LIKE THE WE COULD DEFINITELY DO THAT INTO ACCOUNT AS WERE IMPLEMENTED. SEE HOW THAT GOES. I I GUESS I'M. CONFUSED BY THE COMMITTEE DISCUSSION BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE WHETHER. YOU'RE ADVOCATING FOR MAKING IT HARDER ARE MAKING IT. EASIER SO YOUR CONSTITUENTS WITH SO MISTER CHAIR I I WANNA MAKE SURE IT'S EASIER BECAUSE IF IF YOU'RE TAKING CREDITS THOSE CREDITS. COMBINED HOW MUCH CLASSROOM HOURS AND HOMEWORK OUT. AND WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS NOW IT'S GONNA BE SELF REPORTING. SO WHY ARE WE JUST GIVEN A STUDENTS THE HOURS FOR THEIR CREDITS. BECAUSE SOME OF THAT GOES INTO THEIR HOME. SO WE'REGONNA BASED OFF OF THEIR HOMEWORK. IT MAY BE DOCTOR WHATEVER. OR FROM. MR MEDINA CAN HELP WITH THIS. WHY IT YOU WOULD THINK WE WOULD BE SETTING UP A SYSTEM? GUARANTEEING THEM THE HOURS THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY GETTING FOR THEIR CREDIT [inaudible] VERSES. LIMITING THEM TO TO THREE HOURS IS IS A WRIST HOLE GOT AND I THINK I THINK WE ARM. AT WHY THINK WE'VE WE TOTALLY AGREE WITH THAT MINDSET AND TRYING TO MAKE IT MORE STREAMLINED AND EASIER I THINK THIS WAS THAT. THE EFFORT WAS TO TRY TO MAKE IT EASIER SO PER PERHAPS YOU KNOW FINANCE COULD JUST DON'T DO IT WITH THE SELF REPORTING IS GONNA AT ANOTHER. WELL IF TO IT WHERE WE ON THE OLD BASED UPON CREDIT ASIAN AND HOW MANY HOURS THEY'RE GETTING GOTTA SEE YOUR TO SEE YOUR YOUR YOUR POINT IS THAT. THIS APPROACH IS AUTOMATICALLY GET CREDITS WITHOUTHAVING TO EVEN DO THE REPORTING IS THAT WELL IF IF THEY'RE TAKING THE CLASSES. AND WE KNOW THAT HE HAS A CLASS RESIDENTS ARE PASSING WORK. CREATOR HAVING WE WE KNOW HOW MUCH THOSE CREDITS ARE WORTH. HOW MANY HOURS GOING TO THAT HOW MANY HOME WORK HOURS GOING TO THAT? WOULD ONLY MAKE SENSE THAT WE WOULD HAVE A SOLID SYSTEM VERSES NOW THEY HAVE TO DO ONE MORE STEP IN GOING TO SELF REPORTING. ALL THE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING CAL WORKS ARE. A LOT OF THEM ARE. WORKING A PART TIME JOB THEY'RE GOING TO SCHOOL THE TRANSIT CARE THEIR KIDS TRYING TO BETTER THEMSELVES SO NOW WE'RE GONNA ONE MORE BURDEN ON THEM. WHEN WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT THE CREDIT ASIAN HOURS ALL? I THINK IT'S A FAIR POINT AYE AYE YEAH I THINK THIS IS AN INTENT TO PLACE ANY BURNING ON ANY OF THE CAPITA CHIP AND OVERALL WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT. NO OF THE HOURS THAT THERE ARE BEING ACCOUNTED FOR AND THE PARK PLAN SO THAT IT GIVES THEM MORE. HOURS AND FOR PURPOSES OF YOU KNOW DON'T WANT WELFARE TO WORK ACTIVITIES AN ACCOUNT FOR THAT SO IT'S THEN INTENT BY MINOR SENATE SITES KNOWNMEANS. TO MAKE IT MORE COMPLICATED FOR THE ACCOUNT WHICH RECIPIENT YEAH THAT WILL THE CURRENT SYSTEM WE COUNT THE HOURS IN THE CLASSROOM NOT. WHAT THE PROBLEM SO WE NEEDED A IS WE'RE DOING NEW SYSTEMS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE? WE WENT AGAIN WE KNOW HOW MUCH THE ACCREDITATION HOURS OR IN THE HOMEWORK IS IN OURS ARE INCLUDED INTO THAT ON AN ACCREDITATION SITE. FOR FOR COLLEGE CREDITS AND WITH CAL WORKS ONLY GIVING THEM THE HOURS IN THE CLASSROOM. WE ALREADY KNOW ON THE ACCREDITATION SITE HOW MUCH HOMEWORK HOURS WERE INCLUDED. SO WE'RE GOING TO BALANCE THAT OUT ON THE CAL WORKS SIDE WHERE WE JUST TAKE A NUMBER FROM THE ACCREDITATION CITING GIVEN NOT TO THE VERSES A SELF REPORTING MECHANISM. IT'S GOING [inaudible] TO CREATE QUESTIONS. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A LOT OF WORK WE DO HERE. AYE I THINK IT'S A GREAT POINT AND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT AND SOMEONE AGAIN NEXT YEAR I THINK FAIR FAIR POINT. ANY OTHER. COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. OKAY SEEN ON ANY PUBLIC COMMENT IN SUPPORT OF S. B. HIT FOR FIVE THERE COULD AFTERNOON KEVIN NOTHING COALITION CALIFORNIA. WELFARE RIGHTS ORGANIZATION RELATIVE TO YOUR PREVIOUS DISCUSSION [inaudible] CURRENTLY. IF YOU HAVE A WELFARE TO WORK PLAN YOU HAVE TWELVE UNITS. YOU AUTOMATICALLY GET TWELVE HOURS OF STUDY TIME. PREVIOUSLY FOR THOU FINISHER PROGRAMS. THE STUDY TIME THERE AND APPLY. THIS IS TO EQUALIZE THE PLAYING FIELD. THEN GIVE THE SAME STUDY TIME. A SELF INITIATED PROGRAMS THAT IS AVAILABLE TO FOLKS WITH THE REGULAR WELFARE TO WORK PROGRAM. THE SELF FINISHES PEOPLE WERE IN COLLEGE WHEN THEY APPLY FOR WELFARE. THEY COULD CONTINUE TO GO TO COLLEGE RATHER THAN DROPPING OUT. THE OTHER TYPE IS. GOING APPLY YOU GOT A JOB CLUB AND THEN YOU GO SEE WORKER. THEN THEY SEND YOU TO COLLEGE. THREE IF YOU GO IF YOU WANT TO LARA VERSION YOU GOT THE STUDY TIME THE FORMER VERSION. YOU CAN GET THE STUDY TIME. WHICH WAS KIND OF NUTS. SO WE JUST TRY TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR FOLKS. TO ACHIEVE SELF SUFFICIENCY. THAT'S A PROBLEM THAT YOU KNOW IT ALSO WOULDN'T SO SAY THAT WE SUPPORT. THE 10% INCREASE WE SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU.

TO CALIPHATES ARE. LASTLY I HAD THIS BILL ESTABLISHES VARIOUS REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CALIFORNIA ACCOUNT CENSUS WITHOUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MISTER FOX. I WONDER IF YOU COULD GIVE ME SOME UP BACKGROUND OR I SHOULD SOME LIGHT IN THE PROVISION THAT AFFECTS. THE CURRENT MEDICAL OCCURRED MEDICAL IN TERMS OF THEIR HOSPO THIRTY MYERS JENNINGS AND TWENTY FOURTEEN AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY SIX CREATE THE CURRENT HEALTH AUTHORITY -- AND THAT NOW THERE'S A PROVISION IN THIS BUDGET TRAILER THAT BASICALLY FORCES EMPLOYEES INTO A CASE ERA AGAINST THE AGAINST THE WILL OF THE CURRENT UP HER MEDICAL. THERE IS A PROVISION IN THIS GENERAL GOVERNMENT TRAILER BILL THAT PROSPECTIVELY OUT REQUIRES EMPLOYEES HIRED BY THE KERN COUNTY HOSPITAL AUTHORITY I HAD TO BE A MEMBER. OF THE KERN COUNTY EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED IN THE APPLICABLE AMMO YOU. WAS THIS PROVISION DID IT HAVE INPUT FROM KERN MEDICAL OR THE CAR AT THE COUNTY OF KERN. WE DON'T BELIEVE SO [inaudible] SO THEN. I GUESS MAYBE IT. EXPLAINED TO ME THEN. HOW THIS BUDGET? OTHERS PROVISION MAKES SENSE IF THE TO THE BIGGEST STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVEMENTS PROCESS WERE NOT. ALLOWED TO PROVIDE INPUT. I'M AS I'VE STATED PREVIOUSLY MANY OF THE PROVISIONS THROUGHOUT THE BILLS BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP IN THIS PROVISION AS ONE AND IT WAS THIS PROVISION DISCUSS WITH THE AUTHOR OF AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY SIX DID THE AUTHOR OF THE ORIGINAL. CURRENT HEALTH AUTHORITY DID HE SIGNED OFF ON THIS. AND AS SOME MISS COSTS ALREADY YEAH. MY APOLOGIES SOME OF ONE SYSTEM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND WE ARE NOT AWARE OF THE DISCUSSIONS THAT HAPPENED ON WITH THE RELATED PARTIES. BUT MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT OF COURSE IS IN IT AT A LOCAL ISSUE -- IN TERMS OF THAT DISCUSSION BETWEEN COUNTY OF KERN THE KERN MEDICAL -- AND OF COURSE THE EMPLOYEES -- DOWN IN KERN COUNTY -- MANY OF WHERE REPRESENT AND SO IT SEEMS TO GREATEST CONCERN TO ME THAT THE BUDGET PROCESS IS BEING [inaudible] TO SWAY ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER AGAINST THE WILL OF A LOCAL THE LOCAL FOR A STAKEHOLDERS THAT HAVE THE BIGGEST -- INPUT HAD TO BE PROVIDED IN THIS SITUATION [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE COMMENTS. OKAY SEEING NOT ANY PUBLIC COMMENT IS SUPPORT. IT OR ON BEHALF OF THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION AND I CAN ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I THINK WE'RE JUST ASKED BY THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WE WERE. ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THE DISCUSSION AROUND KERN A MEDICAL CENTER WE BELIEVE ACTUALLY THE AGREEMENT YOU SEE IN THE BUDGET WAS VERY CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENTIONS OF THE PROPOSAL. AND AB TWENTY SIX FORTY SIX AM THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IN THE BUDGET IS TO PROVIDE PARITY TO NEW EMPLOYEES THAT ARE COMING INTO KERN MEDICAL CENTER. THAT SAME ABILITY FOR THEM TO HAVE PENSIONS LIKE EMPLOYEES THAT ARE IN THE KERN MEDICAL CENTER RIGHT NOW RIGHT NOW THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A LOOPHOLE SO THAT NEW EMPLOYEES ARE NOT GOING TO GET THE SAME BENEFIT. WE BELIEVE THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE BILL AND PROVIDES PARITY AMONGST THE EMPLOYEES ACROSS KERN MEDICAL CENTER TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO PUT MONEY INTO THEIR PENSIONS MISS. FOR JUST ONE QUICK QUESTION DID YOU -- IT DID YOU ARE A FOLKS THAT YOU ARE WITH THESE YOU DISCUSS THIS WITH THAT THE AUTHOR OF TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY FOUR BY FIVE FORTY SIX AND THE AUTHOR AMENABLE TO THESE CHANGES YES THERE'S BEEN DISCUSSIONS I THINK WITH PEOPLE ACROSS THE BOARD OBVIOUSLY NEGOTIATIONS ARE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE. LEADERSHIP AMEND FOLKS HERE BUT THERE'S BEEN CONVERSATIONS FOR A LONG TIME ABOUT THE CONCERNS ABOUT KERN MEDICAL CENTER SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE PENSION PROBLEMS WE BELIEVE THIS WAS A PLACE TO LAND IN THE MIDDLE GROUND. TO RELEASE CARRY THIS OVER INTO THE JULY FIRST STATE WHEN WE EXPECT THE AMMO YOU TO BE DECIDED UPON. SO JUST TO CLARIFY THEN THE AUTHOR OF THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR OF THIS THAT THINK THE CREATION OF CURRENT HEALTH AUTHORITY HE SUPPORTS THIS PROVISION. HE'S BEEN ENGAGE IN DISCUSSIONS I BELIEVE SO SO YOU HAVE TO ASK THE AUTHOR DIRECTLY THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT.
