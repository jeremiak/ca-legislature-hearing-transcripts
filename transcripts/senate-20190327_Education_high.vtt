THIS BILL IS A SIMPLE BILL BUT A

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:20.280
VERY IMPORTANT BILL THAT

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:21.681
REQUIRES SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.937
PREVENTING IT FROM MAKING

00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:44.771
INSULIN.

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:46.372
WITH THE LACK OF INSULIN A RISE

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.941
IN BLOOD GLUCOSE QUICKLY CAN

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:49.709
LEAD TO SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS

00:01:58.852 --> 00:02:01.621
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO DO SO.

00:02:04.357 --> 00:02:05.925

00:03:23.937 --> 00:03:27.273
DIABETIC -- SINCE THE AGE OF SIX

00:03:35.815 --> 00:03:38.017
EDUCATION AND EMPOWER MAN IS

00:03:38.084 --> 00:03:41.521
EVERYTHING AND FOR ME AS A CHILD

00:03:41.588 --> 00:03:43.222
I WAS DIAGNOSED.

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:44.891
AT THE AGE OF SIX AND WAS

00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.760
EXTREMELY EXTREMELY SICK AND NO

00:03:47.827 --> 00:03:49.696
ONE UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT WAS

00:03:49.762 --> 00:03:50.530
BECAUSE THERE'S NO EDUCATION ON

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:51.431
IT.

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:53.600
ANDSO YOU KNOW AS A DIABETIC

YOUR BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL CAN RISE

00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:56.703
EXTREMELY HIGH.

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.638
MINDED UP TO ALMOST EIGHT

00:03:58.705 --> 00:03:59.973
HUNDRED WHICH WAS PRETTY MENDOZA

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:01.608
KETO ACIDOSIS LEVEL.

00:04:01.674 --> 00:04:04.744
BECAUSE OF THE ON EDUCATION ON

00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:05.979
IT AND MY FAMILY.

00:04:06.045 --> 00:04:06.980
AS MUCH AS A LOT ME THOUGHT I

00:04:07.046 --> 00:04:08.948
HAD THE FLU OR DE HYDRATED

00:04:09.015 --> 00:04:10.450
MISDIAGNOSED BY THE SCHOOL NURSE

00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:11.918
DOCTORS AND AGAIN.

00:04:11.985 --> 00:04:16.089
GOES BACK -- TO IT WHEN I GOT TO

00:04:16.155 --> 00:04:17.624
THE HOSPITAL I SPENT ALMOST.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.026
ALMOST A MONTH IN THE HOSPITAL

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:22.795
ONCE A DIAGNOSED AND WERE ABLE

00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:25.231
TO START TO CORRECT -- THE HIGH

00:04:25.298 --> 00:04:27.467
BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL AND IT IS A

00:04:27.533 --> 00:04:30.269
VERY VERY DEADLY DISEASE IF LEFT

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:31.471
UNDIAGNOSED.

00:04:31.537 --> 00:04:33.640
AND I THINK IT IS SUCH A STRONG

00:04:33.706 --> 00:04:36.843
BUILD THIS BILL TO EDUCATE.

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:40.113
AND LET EVERYONE KNOW -- IF YOU

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:41.948

KNOWLEDGE THAT WE TALK ABOUT.

00:04:43.383 --> 00:04:45.818
ANY ABILITY TO EDUCATE PEOPLE

00:04:45.885 --> 00:04:46.853
AND I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.588
CHECK THEIR BLOOD SUGAR COULD BE

00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:50.623
AS SIMPLE AS A A FINGER STACK.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.625
AND SHOWS ANY KIND OF ELEVATED

00:04:52.692 --> 00:04:53.459
LEVEL AT ALL.

00:04:53.526 --> 00:04:54.594
IT GIVES THEM A CHANCE TO

00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:56.696
IMMEDIATELY BE ABLE TO PREPARE

00:04:56.763 --> 00:04:57.997
THEMSELVES TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT

00:04:58.064 --> 00:04:58.531
IT.

00:04:58.598 --> 00:04:59.499
AND LIKE HE SHIRTS SAYS IN OUR

00:04:59.565 --> 00:05:02.201
CAMPAIGN IF YOU KNOW.

00:05:02.268 --> 00:05:05.705
RIGHT HOW KNOWLEDGE IS IS POWER --

00:05:05.772 --> 00:05:07.240
NEXT IS BEING ABLE TO SURVIVE

00:05:07.306 --> 00:05:09.242
THAT IMPACT BECAUSE NOT JUST

EVERYBODY IS IMPACTED RIGHT.

00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:17.717
AND AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN --

00:05:17.784 --> 00:05:19.652
TO BE ABLE TO THRIVE YOU WANT TO

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:21.821
LIVE AN UNBELIEVABLY GREAT LIFE

00:05:21.888 --> 00:05:23.389
YOU WON'T HAVE THAT CHANCE.

00:05:23.456 --> 00:05:25.825

00:07:07.426 --> 00:07:07.860
THAT WOULD HAVE TOLD US

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:09.162

BETWEEN EIGHTY AND A HUNDRED AND

00:07:20.606 --> 00:07:21.941

SAYING IT.

00:07:32.351 --> 00:07:34.320

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.828
MONTHS OLD AND HE IS NOW

00:08:48.895 --> 00:08:50.329
SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD AND A JUNIOR

00:08:50.396 --> 00:08:51.931
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

00:08:51.998 --> 00:08:53.099
TYPE ONE DIABETES IS A

00:08:53.165 --> 00:08:54.767
MANAGEABLE DISEASE IF PROPERLY

00:08:54.834 --> 00:08:57.203
DIAGNOSED IN A TIMELY MANNER.

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.605
THE PROBLEM IS AS YOU'RE HEARING

00:08:59.672 --> 00:09:01.073
IT USUALLY TAKES TWO OR THREE

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.475
VISITS TO THE DOCTOR BEFORE

00:09:02.541 --> 00:09:05.144
PERSONS PROPERLY DIAGNOSED.

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:06.812
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO

00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:08.848
MY PRECIOUS BABY BOY ONE VISIT

00:09:08.915 --> 00:09:10.416
TO THE PEDIATRICIAN.

00:09:10.483 --> 00:09:11.951
AND TO VISITS TO URGENT CARE

00:09:12.018 --> 00:09:13.619
BEFORE MY SON WAS DIAGNOSED WITH

00:09:13.686 --> 00:09:15.087
TYPE ONE DIABETES.

00:09:15.154 --> 00:09:16.756
BY THIS TIME DON'T HAVE A BLOOD

00:09:16.822 --> 00:09:19.392
SUGAR LEVEL OF FIVE HUNDRED AND

00:09:19.458 --> 00:09:20.326
THIRTY EIGHT HE WAS IN DIABETIC

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:23.229
KETOACIDOSIS AND HAD COLLAPSED

00:09:23.296 --> 00:09:25.031
VEINS DUE TO DEHYDRATION.

00:09:25.097 --> 00:09:26.565
HE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL FOR FOUR

00:09:26.632 --> 00:09:27.800
DAYS GETTING HIS BLOOD SUGAR

00:09:27.867 --> 00:09:29.135
STABILIZED.

00:09:29.201 --> 00:09:30.436
I WILL NEVER FORGET THE NURSE

00:09:30.503 --> 00:09:32.204
TELLING ME.

00:09:32.271 --> 00:09:34.040
IT'S A GOOD THING YOU GOT HIM IN

00:09:34.106 --> 00:09:34.607
HE MAY NOT HAVE SURVIVED THE

00:09:34.674 --> 00:09:36.375
NIGHT.

00:09:36.442 --> 00:09:37.910
IT WAS THE MOST TERRIFYING GUT

00:09:37.977 --> 00:09:39.145
WRENCHING FEELING TO THINK I

00:09:39.211 --> 00:09:41.047
COULD HAVE LOST MY PRECIOUS SON

00:09:41.113 --> 00:09:42.548
AND ALL BECAUSE OF HIGH.

00:09:42.615 --> 00:09:43.849
NOR TO THE DOCTORS KNEW THE

00:09:43.916 --> 00:09:45.518
SYMPTOMS TO THE ONSET OF TYPE

00:09:45.584 --> 00:09:47.320
ONE DIABETES.

00:09:47.386 --> 00:09:48.921
OVER THE YEARS THERE BEEN MANY

00:09:48.988 --> 00:09:50.656
ADVANCEMENTS IN THE MANAGEMENT

00:09:50.723 --> 00:09:52.191
OF TYPE ONE DAVE DIABETES WHICH

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:53.926
IS WONDERFUL.

00:09:53.993 --> 00:09:54.860
BUT SADLY THERE BEEN NO

00:09:54.927 --> 00:09:56.963
ADVANCEMENTS IN EDUCATION FOR

00:09:57.029 --> 00:09:58.597
AWARENESS ON THIS DISEASE.

00:09:58.664 --> 00:10:00.166
CHILDREN AND ADULTS ARE STILL

00:10:00.232 --> 00:10:02.301
GOING UNDIAGNOSED ENDING UP IN

00:10:02.368 --> 00:10:03.602
SOME CASES WITH LIFE THREATENING

00:10:03.669 --> 00:10:06.806
COMPLICATIONS AND EVEN DYING.

00:10:06.872 --> 00:10:09.775
THIS MUST AND TOO MANY CHILDREN

00:10:09.842 --> 00:10:11.510
ADULTS ARE DYING FROM IT A

00:10:11.577 --> 00:10:13.612
MANAGEABLE DISEASE.

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:14.680
BECAUSE PEOPLE WITH TYPE ONE

00:10:14.747 --> 00:10:16.382
DIABETES ARE CONSIDERED TO BE A

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:17.917
MINORITY OF THE DIABETIC

00:10:17.984 --> 00:10:19.085
POPULATION THERE IS A LACK OF

00:10:19.151 --> 00:10:21.454
EDUCATION AND PUBLIC AWARENESS.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.755
WE SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE THE

00:10:22.822 --> 00:10:23.956
RESOURCES NEEDED TO GET AN

00:10:24.023 --> 00:10:25.391
ACCURATE NUMBER OF PEOPLE LIVING

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:27.426
WITH TYPE ONE DIABETES IN ORDER

00:10:27.493 --> 00:10:29.729
TO PROVE THIS MINORITY GROUP IS

00:10:29.795 --> 00:10:31.797
GROWING AND GROWING FAST.

00:10:31.864 --> 00:10:33.332
THIS IS AN AN INCREDIBLY

00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:34.467
FRUSTRATING.

00:10:34.533 --> 00:10:36.268
IN FACT ONE OF THE BIG DIABETES

00:10:36.335 --> 00:10:38.170
ORGANIZATIONS WEBSITE STILL

00:10:38.237 --> 00:10:39.705
STATES THE SAME STATISTICS THEY

00:10:39.772 --> 00:10:42.341
HAD LISTED FIFTEEN YEARS AGO

00:10:42.408 --> 00:10:44.510
WHEN MY SON WAS FIRST DIAGNOSED.

00:10:44.577 --> 00:10:45.711
IT'S TIME THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS

00:10:45.778 --> 00:10:47.446
THAT DIABETES IS NOT A SINGLE

00:10:47.513 --> 00:10:49.515
DISEASE AND SHOULD NOT BE LUMPED

00:10:49.582 --> 00:10:51.217
TOGETHER AS SUCH.

00:10:51.283 --> 00:10:52.385
KNOWING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

00:10:52.451 --> 00:10:54.053
TYPE ONE AND TYPE TWO DIABETES

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.588
CAN BE THE DIFFERENCE LITERALLY

00:10:55.654 --> 00:10:57.623
BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH.

00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:58.624
EDUCATING THE PUBLIC TO OUR

00:10:58.691 --> 00:11:00.259
SCHOOLS WILL RAISE AWARENESS TO

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:01.160
THE SYMPTOMS OF TYPE ONE

00:11:01.227 --> 00:11:02.595
DIABETES FOR PARENTS GUARDIANS

00:11:02.661 --> 00:11:04.296
AND CARE GIVERS WHICH CAN HELP

00:11:04.363 --> 00:11:07.033
DETECT AND EARLY DIAGNOSIS.

00:11:07.099 --> 00:11:08.868
RAISING AWARENESS IN SCHOOL IS

00:11:08.934 --> 00:11:10.269
CRUCIAL BECAUSE TYPE ONE

00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:11.871
DIABETES AFFECTS MANY OF OUR

00:11:11.937 --> 00:11:12.972
STUDENTS.

00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:14.273
IF STUDENTS ARE AWARE OF THE

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.175
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF TYPE ONE

00:11:16.242 --> 00:11:17.910
DIABETES SUCH AS HYPERGLYCEMIA

00:11:17.977 --> 00:11:19.378
WHICH IS A HIGH BLOOD SUGAR OR

00:11:19.445 --> 00:11:21.881
HYPOGLYCEMIA LOW BLOOD SUGAR.

00:11:21.947 --> 00:11:23.416
AND KNOW WHAT TO DO TO HELP A

00:11:23.482 --> 00:11:25.518
STUDENT WHO MAY BE IN DISTRESS

00:11:25.584 --> 00:11:26.118
THEY COULD POTENTIALLY SAVE A

00:11:26.185 --> 00:11:27.686
LIFE.

00:11:27.753 --> 00:11:28.554
RAISING AWARENESS WILL ALSO

00:11:28.621 --> 00:11:29.855
BRING COMPASSION AND

00:11:29.922 --> 00:11:31.690
UNDERSTANDING OF THIS AUTOIMMUNE

00:11:31.757 --> 00:11:33.492
DISEASE WHICH WILL HELP AND THE

00:11:33.559 --> 00:11:35.895
STEREO TYPES AND BULLYING THAT

00:11:35.961 --> 00:11:36.462
MAY COME TO STUDENTS WHO ARE

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:38.397
DIFFERENT.

IN PARTICULAR LOW INCOME

00:21:47.139 --> 00:21:48.473

00:22:24.976 --> 00:22:26.578
DISTANCE AWAY.

COULD BE COULD BE ANSWERED BUT

00:24:21.126 --> 00:24:23.395
IN PARTICULAR HOW THE CURRENT

00:24:23.461 --> 00:24:24.930
PROGRAM.

00:24:24.996 --> 00:24:26.364

STUDENTS WHO HAVE BENEFITED FROM

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.601
THE CURRENT PROGRAM.

00:26:57.449 --> 00:26:59.084
ACTUALLY IN CURRENT LAW BECAUSE

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:00.819
IT'S PART OF WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY

00:27:00.885 --> 00:27:02.654
PASSED WITH COFFEE PROBLEMS

00:27:02.721 --> 00:27:04.055
CORRECT AND AND I UNDERSTAND

00:27:04.122 --> 00:27:09.527
THAT WE HAD THIS THERE IS A THAT

00:27:09.594 --> 00:27:11.096
THE BASICALLY THERE THE BILL HAS

00:27:11.162 --> 00:27:12.764
TO RENEW THEIR EXTEND THE THIS

00:27:12.831 --> 00:27:13.999
IS THIS KIND OF HIGHLIGHT.

00:27:14.065 --> 00:27:17.602
IN SOME WAYS CORRECT -- AT LEAST

00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:19.004
THE ORIGINAL ONE I MEAN WE'RE

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:21.373
ATTY RIGHT AND SEVEN AND SO.

00:27:21.439 --> 00:27:23.341
SO I I DO THINK THAT WE NEED I

00:27:23.408 --> 00:27:25.276
THINK THE BIG CONCERN BEFORE AND

00:27:25.343 --> 00:27:26.878
YOUR HEARING AID THAT IS AS

00:27:26.945 --> 00:27:27.846
ABOUT THE EQUITY ISSUES ALL

00:27:27.912 --> 00:27:32.050
RIGHT -- I THINK THE CHALLENGES

00:27:32.117 --> 00:27:33.918
WHEN YOU HAVE STUDENTS.

00:27:33.985 --> 00:27:34.786
TO OUR AND MORE I GUESS UNSTABLE

00:27:34.853 --> 00:27:37.288
CIRCUMSTANCES -- MAY HAVE -- WHO

00:27:37.355 --> 00:27:38.790
WHO WHO WHO WHO MAY NOT HAVE THE

00:27:38.857 --> 00:27:39.357
KIND OF SUPPORTS WHAT I FEEL

00:27:39.424 --> 00:27:40.792
LIKE THEY CAN MAKE A COMMITMENT

00:27:40.859 --> 00:27:42.227
THAT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY BECAUSE

00:27:42.293 --> 00:27:43.261
THEY MAY BE PULLED AWAY?

00:27:43.328 --> 00:27:45.063
JUST MAY HAVE TO GO WORK -- TO

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:47.265
MAKE SOME MONEY -- SUPPORT YOU

00:27:47.332 --> 00:27:49.000
KNOW THEIR FAMILY OR OTHER TYPES

00:27:49.067 --> 00:27:54.672
OF SITUATIONS -- THE THAT

00:27:54.739 --> 00:27:56.207
BECOMES A BIT OF A CHALLENGE FOR

00:27:56.274 --> 00:27:56.841
THEM TO COMMIT ST -- GOING TO

00:27:56.908 --> 00:27:59.077
GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS AND THEN

00:27:59.144 --> 00:28:01.312
IF NOW THEY'RE MORE DISADVANTAGE

00:28:01.379 --> 00:28:02.947
I THINK THAT'S A CONCERN THAT

00:28:03.014 --> 00:28:03.148
YOU.

00:28:03.214 --> 00:28:04.449
HEARD SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN LOOK

00:28:04.516 --> 00:28:06.151
AT THOSE ISSUES -- BEFORE AND

00:28:06.217 --> 00:28:07.552
HOPEFULLY TO SOME DATA WE CAN BE

00:28:07.619 --> 00:28:10.055
GATHERED ON THAT -- AS WE LOOK

00:28:10.121 --> 00:28:11.723
AT THE PROGRAM OVERALL -- WHEN

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:14.759

MY GUESS EXTENSION OR SOMETHING

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:20.598
BUT -- CERTAINLY I THINK -- THE

00:28:20.665 --> 00:28:21.232
WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING THIS BILL

00:28:21.299 --> 00:28:22.100
IS -- SOMETHING I CAN SUPPORT

00:28:22.167 --> 00:28:25.070
TODAY AND WILL -- AND BUT WE

00:28:25.136 --> 00:28:27.005
NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AND

00:28:27.072 --> 00:28:27.839
WHAT HOW THIS IS AFFECTING

00:28:27.906 --> 00:28:29.207

WHICH LIKE CLOTHES THANK YOU

00:29:11.816 --> 00:29:13.017
MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR YOUR

00:29:13.084 --> 00:29:14.419
THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS -- THERE ARE

00:29:14.486 --> 00:29:16.287
SOME MISUNDERSTANDINGS ABOUT THE

00:29:16.354 --> 00:29:17.655
ORIGINAL PROMISE PROGRAM.

00:29:17.722 --> 00:29:20.091
THE FOCUS ON THAT PROGRAM IS ON

00:29:20.158 --> 00:29:21.493
THE LOW INCOME STUDENTS THE

00:29:21.559 --> 00:29:23.761
UNDERSERVED THE FIRST AND THEIR

00:29:23.828 --> 00:29:24.929
FAMILIES AFFECTED IN THE LAW.

00:29:24.996 --> 00:29:27.132
THAT I CAMPUS BASED COMMITTEES

00:29:27.198 --> 00:29:28.399
ARE THE ONES THAT.

00:29:28.466 --> 00:29:29.801
THE ONLY DIRECTION THAT THEY

00:29:29.868 --> 00:29:30.835
GIVE TO THOSE CAMPUS BASED

00:29:30.902 --> 00:29:33.338
COMMITTEES THAT THEY MUST GIVE

00:29:33.404 --> 00:29:34.305
PRIORITY TO THOSE STUDENTS.

00:29:34.372 --> 00:29:36.007
AND THAT ANY OTHER STUDENT

00:29:36.074 --> 00:29:37.075
DOESN'T FIT THAT CATEGORY.

00:29:37.142 --> 00:29:38.676
I DOES NESTLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO

00:29:38.743 --> 00:29:39.878
BE IN THE PROMISE PROGRAM.

00:29:39.944 --> 00:29:42.213
THEY HAVE FULL CONTROL OVER WHO

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.982
IS ALLOWED IN AND WHO'S NOT AND

00:29:44.048 --> 00:29:45.350
THE CRITERIA IS VERY CLEAR.

00:29:45.416 --> 00:29:46.818
YOU HAVE TO BE A LOW INCOME

00:29:46.885 --> 00:29:48.153
STUDENT.

00:29:48.219 --> 00:29:49.487
YOU HAVE -- TO BE UNDER

00:29:49.554 --> 00:29:51.055
REPRESENTED.

00:29:51.122 --> 00:29:52.290
AND YOU HAVE TO BE A FIRST

00:29:52.357 --> 00:29:53.558
GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENT OR A

00:29:53.625 --> 00:29:55.326
TRANSFER STUDENT.

00:29:55.393 --> 00:29:57.428
SO THE FOCUS OF THE PROGRAM FROM

00:29:57.495 --> 00:29:59.297
THE START HAS ALWAYS BEEN ON THE

00:29:59.364 --> 00:30:01.633
STUDENTS WHO HAVE THE MOST NEED

00:30:01.699 --> 00:30:03.168
AND IT CONTINUES TO BE.

00:30:03.234 --> 00:30:05.203
MY CENTRAL GOAL AND I CERTAINLY

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:07.438
DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING THAT

00:30:07.505 --> 00:30:08.306
INTERFERES WITH THAT.

00:30:08.373 --> 00:30:10.408
REGISTRATION FOR CLASSES ON I

00:30:10.475 --> 00:30:11.976
THINK ON ALL CAMPUSES IS BASED

00:30:12.043 --> 00:30:14.512
ON HOW FAR YOU ARE A LONG AND

00:30:14.579 --> 00:30:16.014
GETTING TO A DEGREE.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.549
AND IF YOU'RE A SENIOR AND

00:30:17.615 --> 00:30:18.583
YOU'RE NOT IN THE PROMISE

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:19.050
PROGRAM.

00:30:19.117 --> 00:30:20.718
I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT YOU'RE

00:30:20.785 --> 00:30:21.419
GONNA HAVE THE HIGHEST

00:30:21.486 --> 00:30:22.987
REGISTRATION PRIORITY BECAUSE OF

00:30:23.054 --> 00:30:24.322
YOUR UNIT COUNT IT'S JUST WHAT

00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:25.857
HAPPENS ON THE CAMPUSES IN

00:30:25.924 --> 00:30:27.025
GENERAL.

00:30:27.091 --> 00:30:28.259
AND SO THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW

00:30:28.326 --> 00:30:29.360
THIS IS GOING TO HOLD BACK

00:30:29.427 --> 00:30:30.562
SOMEBODY WHO IS NOT IN THE

00:30:30.628 --> 00:30:32.197
PROMISE PROGRAM THAT'S UNDER

00:30:32.263 --> 00:30:33.698
REPRESENTED -- POOR IT'S JUST

00:30:33.765 --> 00:30:35.166
NOT TRUE.

00:30:35.233 --> 00:30:36.201
IT'S JUST NOT TRUE.

00:30:36.267 --> 00:30:37.502
NOW DO WE HAVE INSTITUTIONAL

00:30:37.569 --> 00:30:39.137
ISSUES ON THE CAMPUS OF MAKING

00:30:39.204 --> 00:30:40.471
CLASSES AVAILABLE YES WE DO

00:30:40.538 --> 00:30:42.507
THAT'S A BROADER ISSUE.

00:30:42.574 --> 00:30:44.075
GOES BEYOND THIS THIS BILL AND

00:30:44.142 --> 00:30:44.876
CERTAINLY.

00:30:44.943 --> 00:30:46.044
THE ONLY REQUIREMENT OF THIS

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:47.212
BILL IS THAT IT CREATES

00:30:47.278 --> 00:30:48.980
INCENTIVES FOR THE CAMPUS TO

00:30:49.047 --> 00:30:50.682
AVOID THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

00:30:50.748 --> 00:30:52.717
TO PROVIDE THOSE CLASSES IT AT

00:30:52.784 --> 00:30:54.886
NO COST.

00:30:54.953 --> 00:30:55.887
BUT THE CSU IS SUCH A IT'S SUCH

00:30:55.954 --> 00:30:57.288
A MIRACLE PLACE FOR OUR OUR OUR

00:30:57.355 --> 00:30:59.257
LOW INCOME KIDS YOU KNOW THAT

00:30:59.324 --> 00:31:01.392
75% OF OUR STUDENTS AT THE CSU

00:31:01.459 --> 00:31:03.161
GRADUATE SEES ME QUALIFY FOR

00:31:03.228 --> 00:31:04.329
FINANCIAL AID.

00:31:04.395 --> 00:31:07.565
BY DEFINITION 75% ARE OF THE

00:31:07.632 --> 00:31:08.866
LOWER INCOME.

00:31:08.933 --> 00:31:10.068
THAT FITS THE CRITERIA THE

00:31:10.134 --> 00:31:12.804
PROMISE PROGRAM LAST YEAR 60% OF

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:14.472
OUR GRADUATES FROM THE CSU OVER

00:31:14.539 --> 00:31:16.274
A HUNDRED THOUSAND FIRST IN

00:31:16.341 --> 00:31:18.810
THEIR FAMILY TO GRADUATE IT'S AN

00:31:18.876 --> 00:31:20.211
IT'S A MIRACLE PLACE. FOR SO

00:31:20.278 --> 00:31:22.046
MANY TO GIVE THEM THIS GREAT

00:31:22.113 --> 00:31:23.748
ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY.

00:31:23.815 --> 00:31:25.650
I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING THAT

00:31:25.717 --> 00:31:27.852
DOES ANYTHING BUT SUPPORT THAT

00:31:27.919 --> 00:31:29.887
CONTINUED WONDERFUL MIRACLE FROM

00:31:29.954 --> 00:31:32.523
CONTINUING OKAY -- AND I THINK

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:33.057
THAT THIS BILL IS NARROWLY

00:31:33.124 --> 00:31:35.159
FOCUSED -- BUT I CERTAINLY FROM

00:31:35.226 --> 00:31:36.194
THE COULD CONCERNS HAVE BEEN

00:31:36.261 --> 00:31:39.130
RAISED EARLIER -- I AYE ARE WERE

00:31:39.197 --> 00:31:40.632
LINES ON WHAT WE WANT TO

00:31:40.698 --> 00:31:41.566
ACCOMPLISH.

00:31:41.633 --> 00:31:42.900
THESE ARE THESE ARE SMALL STEPS

00:31:42.967 --> 00:31:44.302
THAT WE'RE TAKING OUT OF A

00:31:44.369 --> 00:31:46.170
LARGER DESIRE TO HAVE THESE KIDS

00:31:46.237 --> 00:31:47.305
BE SUCCESSFUL AND NOT HAVE TO

00:31:47.372 --> 00:31:48.373
WASTE THOSE.

00:31:48.439 --> 00:31:49.641
HIGH SCHOOL SCORES THEIR COLLEGE

00:31:49.707 --> 00:31:51.609
ADMISSIONS THE LOANS ALL THOSE

00:31:51.676 --> 00:31:52.310
THINGS.

00:31:52.377 --> 00:31:53.911
BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT FOLKS.

00:31:53.978 --> 00:31:57.215
THIS YEAR TENS OF THOUSANDS ARE

00:31:57.282 --> 00:31:58.416
GONNA DROP OUT.

00:31:58.483 --> 00:31:59.484
WITH ALL THAT DATA IF THEY HAVE

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:01.185
IT AND NOT HAVE A DEGREE WE GOT

00:32:01.252 --> 00:32:02.320
IT WE GOT TO DO BETTER I KNOW

PRELIMINARY WORK TO BE DONE KIND

00:37:00.952 --> 00:37:02.920
OF STRATEGICALLY IF THE DISTRICT

00:37:02.987 --> 00:37:04.922
WANTED TO AWARD THE CONTRACT

00:37:04.989 --> 00:37:06.557
BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW SUMMERS ARE

00:37:06.624 --> 00:37:07.992
GETTING SHORTER AND SHORTER.

00:37:08.059 --> 00:37:10.795
IN THE SCHOOL VACATION PERIOD SO

00:37:10.861 --> 00:37:11.462
IF WE COULD GET ALL THOSE

00:37:11.529 --> 00:37:14.098
SUBCONTRACTS AWARDED MATERIALS

00:37:14.165 --> 00:37:16.033
AND EVERYTHING STAGE THEN AS

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:17.602
SOON AS THE STATE ARCHITECT HAS

00:37:17.668 --> 00:37:19.337

00:37:21.105 --> 00:37:21.806
OUT.

00:37:21.872 --> 00:37:23.174
THEN OUR CONSTRUCTION CRAFTSMAN

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:24.842
CAN COME RIGHT IN AND HAVE A

00:37:24.909 --> 00:37:27.378

IN AND TRYING TO DO -- QUICK

00:37:31.849 --> 00:37:34.652
FIXES SO THAT'S THE IDEA I

00:37:34.719 --> 00:37:36.253
REALLY LIKE THAT THE BILL

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.855
PROTECTS THE FIELD ACT

00:37:37.922 --> 00:37:41.726
REQUIREMENT THAT NO CONSTRUCTION.

00:37:41.792 --> 00:37:42.326

DRAWINGS AND SPECIFICATIONS.

00:37:47.164 --> 00:37:49.200
SO I DON'T THINK THE DISTRICTS

00:37:49.266 --> 00:37:51.369
WILL USE THIS TOOL ON EVERY ONE

00:37:51.435 --> 00:37:54.005

CALIFORNIA I PERSONALLY FOUND

00:43:38.882 --> 00:43:40.651
THAT SHOCKING WHEN I FOUND OUT.

00:43:40.718 --> 00:43:42.086

00:43:42.152 --> 00:43:44.154
UNACCEPTABLE AND WE OWE OUR

00:44:07.478 --> 00:44:09.279
THIS ADDITIONAL SOURCE OF STRESS

00:44:09.346 --> 00:44:10.881
CAN LEAD TO LOWER ACADEMIC --

00:44:10.948 --> 00:44:12.383

00:46:24.515 --> 00:46:25.516
UNIVERSITY.

00:46:25.582 --> 00:46:26.884
BUT JUGGLING MULTIPLE JOBS AT

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:28.185
THE SAME TIME MADE THE WORKLOAD

00:46:28.252 --> 00:46:29.520
UNSUSTAINABLE.

00:46:29.586 --> 00:46:31.421
SO THIS IS NOT UNCOMMON AT ALL

00:46:31.488 --> 00:46:32.623
AND NON TUITION COSTS A

00:46:32.689 --> 00:46:34.057
COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAN BE SO HIGH

00:46:34.124 --> 00:46:35.559
THAT SOME STUDENTS TAKE SEVERAL

00:46:35.626 --> 00:46:37.127
YEARS TO COMPLETE.

00:46:37.194 --> 00:46:38.295
AND CALIFORNIA HAS THE LOWEST

00:46:38.362 --> 00:46:40.330
COMMUNITY COLLEGE TUITION IN THE

00:46:40.397 --> 00:46:41.532

PAY NO TUITION WHICH IS REALLY

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:44.034
GREAT.

00:46:44.101 --> 00:46:44.935
BUT IT ISN'T ENOUGH WHEN

00:46:45.002 --> 00:46:47.104
TEXTBOOKS RENT FOOD CHILD CARE

00:46:47.171 --> 00:46:48.405
