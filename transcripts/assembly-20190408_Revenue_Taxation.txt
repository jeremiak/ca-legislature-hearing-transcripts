DON'T WE GET STARTED AS A SUB COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS WOULD YOU LIKE. START WE'RE GONNA START WITH FILE ITEM ONE AB SEVEN TWENTY THREE AND THIS IS REGULAR ORDER BUSINESS [inaudible] THANK YOU. CHAIR AND MEMBERS EXCITED TO BE HERE AS YOU ALL KNOW -- IT'S BEEN REPEATED BY MANY FOLKS CALIFORNIA'S EXPERIENCING. A HOUSING CRISIS AND WE MUST FIND CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO PROTECT OUR RESIDENTS FROM DISPLACEMENT WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY BUILDING YOUR HOMES FOR ALL INCOME LEVELS. IN THE BAY AREA THE CITY OF OAKLAND A'S BEGIN CONVERTING THEIR EXISTING RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS INTO AFFORDABLE UNITS. THIS HAS THE BENEFIT OF PROTECTING RESIDENTS AND THEIR HOMES AND IS QUICKER AND LESS EXPENSIVE THAN BUILDING NEW RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE HOUSING. UNDER EXISTING LAW A TAX EXEMPTION TO CONVERT TO BUILDINGS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING ONLY APPLIES TO HOUSING. OCCUPIED BY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS BASED UPON THE VERIFICATION OF EACH HOUSEHOLD INCOME. AB SEVEN TWENTY THREE PROPOSES TO EXPAND EXISTING LAW AND PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE PAYMENT FOR PROPERTIES LEAST TO AND OPERATED BY A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION. WHEN A PROPERTY OWNER CONVERTS THEIR EXISTING BUILDING TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING? INITIALLY THE BILL IS NARROWLY. FOCUSED ON ALAMEDA AND CONTRA COSTA COUNTIES AND HAS A FIVE YEAR SUNSET. UNDER THESE PROVISIONS. WE ARE WORKING WITH THE ALAMEDA ASSESSOR -- AND OTHERS -- TO WORK THROUGH SOME OF THOSE ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE REYES BUT ARE COMMITTED TO FINDING A WORKABLE SOLUTION WITH THEM AND WE'VE GOT THE CITY OF OPEN HERE. TO TESTIFY AS WELL WHO IS THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL WE HAVE SUPPORT BY THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS THE HABITAT FOR HUMANITY. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M THERE AND RUN A LADY ON THE POLICY DIRECTOR FOR HOUSING SECURITY IN THE OFFICE OF OAKLAND MAYOR LIBBY SCHAAF. THE HOUSING CRISIS IS HAVING A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON THE CITY OF OAKLAND IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS RENTS HAVE INCREASED 56%. SALES PRICES HAVE INCREASED 65%. THIS MEANS THAT MANY LONGTIME OPENERS CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO LIVE IN THE CITY AND ARE FORCED TO LEAVE THE CITY AN INDOOR HORRENDOUS COMMUTE OR TO LIVE ON OUR STREETS. IN RESPONSE THE CITY'S BEEN TAKING AGGRESSIVE STEPS TO ADDRESS THIS HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS WE'VE STREAMLINED HOUSING PRODUCTION. SO THE LAST THREE YEARS WE'VE BUILT MORE THAN TEN TIMES THE NUMBER OF HOUSING UNITS IN THE PREVIOUS THREE YEARS. WE'VE ALSO BUILDING MORE SUBSIDIZED AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE'VE INCREASED OUR FOR A HOUSING IMPACT FEES THE VOTERS HAVE PASSED LOCALAFFORDABLE HOUSING BONDS. AND WE'VE ALSO BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL AT SECURING STATE FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH. WE'RE STILL SHORT ON MEETING OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING GOALS AND WE NEED MORE TOOLS. AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER STATED ONE OF OUR GROWING STRATEGIES IS TAKING EXISTING. HOUSING WERE CURRENT TENANTS ARE PAYING AFFORDABLE RENTS. AND CONVERTING THAT TO LONG TERM RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THIS IS QUICKER AND CHEAPER THAN BUILDING NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND IT PROTECTS EXISTING TENANTS FROM DISPLACEMENT. WE'VE TALKED TO PROPERTY OWNERS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN CONVERTING PROPERTIES INTO AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT THEY NEED A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE. THIS BILL WOULD INCENTIVIZE PROPERTY OWNERS TO CONVERT HOUSING. INTO AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THIS MANNER. THANK YOU. AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. ADDITIONAL IN THIS IS IN SUPPORT YES. EVERY GIRL FROM. WHEN IS IS IN OPPOSITION? COMMENTS QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE NETWORK. IN THE ANALYSIS IT ASK THAT YOU AMEND YOUR BILL TO INCLUDE CITIES AS WELL AS COUNTIES. IN THEIR ABILITY TO PAY THIS AMOUNT. WILL YOU BE DOING THAT. YEAH I THINK WE'RE VERY OPEN TO MINUTES YEP. OKAY. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THING I WOULD LIKE CLOSE. WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND WE HAVE A QUORUM WILL TAKE IT UP FOR OKAY. THANK YOU. MOVING TO FILE ITEM EIGHT AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY FOUR FOR TESTING ONLY ONLY ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY FOUR IS A BILL THAT WOULD ADDRESS WHAT IS A MAJOR HOLE IN OUR STATE'S HOUSING POLICY AND THAT IS THE PLIGHT OF THE MISSING MIDDLE. THE MISSING MIDDLE REFER TO TENS OF MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO EARN TOO MUCH TO QUALIFY FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT ARE UNABLE TO AFFORD MARKET RATE HOUSING. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TEACHERS AND NURSES FIREFIGHTERS AND COPS HEALTHCARE CHILDCARE PROVIDERS RETAIL AND SERVICE WORKERS THOSE WHO WERE CRITICAL TO OUR ECONOMY WHO PROVIDE ESSENTIAL SERVICES. THIS BILL ADDRESSES THE PLIGHT OF THE MISSING MIDDLE BY CREATING A PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION TO CERTAIN MIDDLE INCOME RENTAL UNITS OFFERED AND AFFORDABLE RENT TO HOUSEHOLDS MAKING BETWEEN EIGHTY AND A 120% OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME. NONPROFIT DEVELOPERS AND HOUSING OPERATORS WHO RECEIVED EXEMPTION WOULD COMMIT THE FOR SAVINGS TO REDUCE RENTS FOR MIDDLE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS 220% BELOW THE FAIR MARKET RENT FOR AN AREA. THIS WILL SPUR CONSTRUCTION OF NEW MODERATE INCOME UNITS AND ALLOWS TO PRESERVE AND REDUCE RENTS IN SOME -- IN SOME OF OUR EXISTING UNITS ON THE MARKET. I'LL JUST NOTE THIS BILL WILL NOT DRAW WAY SUBSIDY A RESOURCES AWAY FROM THE ALREADY LIMITED POOL OF STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING FOR LOW INCOME AFFORDABLE HOUSING. OUR JOINT AUTHORS ON THIS BILL WHO REPRESENTS SOME OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE RENTAL MARKETS IN THE STATE HAVE SEEN OUR MIDDLE CLASS IS BEING HOLLOWED OUT BY THE HOUSING CRISIS. HOW FAMILIES ARE PAYING TOO MUCH IN BEING PUSHED FARTHER AND FARTHER FROM THEIR JOBS AND WITH THAT LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESS? MARINO WHITE FROM THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM. AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS MARINO WHITE WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM -- ARMAND MEMBERS ARE FOCUSED ON THE PRODUCTION PRESERVATION OF LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSING AND BRING TOGETHER EVERYONE THAT IS INVOLVED IN PUTTING TOGETHER DEVELOPMENT DEALS. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO MENTION WERE IN THE MIDST OF A CRUSHING HOUSING CRISIS WHICH YOU'RE ALL AWARE OF AND THAT AND WE'VE HEARD MUCH BOTH FROM THE GOVERNOR MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE. AROUND THE PROBLEM WORD NOW THAT THE THE HIGH RENTS ARE IMPACTING MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS PRIMARILY AND HIGH COST COUNTIES -- THE STATE IS CONTEMPLATING MANY DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO INCENTIVIZE THE PRODUCTION OF RENTAL HOUSING FOR THIS INCOME BAND AND THIS BILL DOES A VERY CAREFUL JOB OF THREADING THE NEEDLE TO ENSURE. THAT WHAT THE STATE IS DOING REALLY TARGETS THOSE UNITS IN THOSE HIGH COST COUNTY SO THAT WE'RE NOT TAKING AWAY NECESSARY RESOURCES BOTH FROM LOW INCOME HOUSING PRODUCTION. AND ALSO NOT NOT -- SUBSIDIZING MARKET RATE HOUSING THAT MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS IN SOME PARTS OF SEE CAN'T AFFORD -- AND SO FOR THAT REASON WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS MEASURE WE THINK IT REALLY COMPLEMENTS THE OTHER EFFORTS THAT WILL PAIR PERFECTLY WITH WHAT LOCALS ARE DOING IT TO TO IMPACT THIS INCOME BAND. AND WILL ALSO FARE VERY WELL WITH KELLY TO PHASE MAKES INCOME LOAN PROGRAM THEY'LL BE SERVING HOUSEHOLDS MAKING A RANGE OF INCOMES FROM 30% AM I 210020% AND MY THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WHEN IS IS IN OPPOSITION? MADAM CHAIRMAN MY NAME IS PATRICK SABLE HOW SOME OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL REPORT WILL HOUSING AND WE WE SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU. WHEN THIS IS IN OPPOSITION? SEEING NINE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE DOT QUIRK -- THE ASSESSORS ARE CONCERNED BOTH ABOUT WORKLOAD AND ADMINISTRATIVE DIFFICULTIES YOU WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT TO THE ON THAT ISSUE -- I HAVE NOT SEEN THEIR LETTER AT BY I THINK WHAT IT IS IN THE ANALYSIS IN THE ANALYSIS WHAT THE BILL DOES THAT BIG SORT OF CAREFULLY THREADS THAT NEEDLE IS BY PAYING A PAIR IS THIS WITH EXISTING MODERATE INCOME HOUSING PRODUCTION PROGRAMS THAT HAVE SORT OF A DEED. RESTRICTION SO I EXPECT MOST THE TIME THIS THE THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL WILL BE USING KINDS IN KIND I'M. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT PROGRAM WHERE THERE'S A SIMILAR MINISTRATION AT THAT THE SENSORS ARE USED TO DEALING WITH. I JUST SKIM THROUGH THE LETTER AND AND SO YOU KNOW I ACTUALLY JUST REACH OUT TO MY SISTER TO UNDERSTAND -- THE GIST OF THIS IN MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IN OUR CITY -- SHE DOESN'T SHARE THE PERSPECTIVE OF A FELLOW SISTERS BUT WE WILL. UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT THAT I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED WAS SAID. IT IT'S SUGGESTED THAT THERE'S SOME CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT CONSTITUTES PROPER RENT RESTRICTIONS BECAUSE WE HAVE TWO STANDARDS IN THE BILL ON WHAT RENT RESTRICTIONS WOULD ENTAIL. I WILL TELL YOU I PERSONALLY THINK THAT IT'S CLEAR TO SAY RENTS AT 20% BELOW FOR MARKET RENT OR MARKET STUDY THAT'S PREPARED FOR THAT PARTICULAR MARKET BUT I AM MORE THAN HAPPY AGAIN WITH -- THE COMMITTEES -- IF THE COMMITTEES INTERESTED IN DIVING INTO WHETHER THERE'S ADDITIONAL CLARITY THAT WE CAN BUILD INTO WHAT THAT STANDARD IS. AND WE ARE ENGAGING WITH THE ASSESSOR TO TRY TO HAVE -- TO TRY TO DRILL DOWN ON THEIR CONCERTS. THANK YOU. SEEING AND HEARING NONE -- AND AND FOR THE RECORD MR TO AND I ARE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS BILL THIS WEEK SO WE WILL HAVE MORE INFORMATION LATER -- WITH THAT WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE I APPRECIATE THE CONSIDERATION THE COMMITTEE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE CHAIR -- WOMAN'S -- ATTENTION TO THIS AND LOOK FORWARD TO FUTURE CONVERSATIONS RECORDED AT THIS NO ACTION ON THIS ITEM TODAY BUT THANK YOU. MOVING TO FILE ITEM. SEVEN AB FIFTEEN NINETY THREE SHE'S ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN. GOOD MORNING OR GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM SPEAKER AND A MEMBERS. TODAY I PRESENT TO YOU AB. FIFTEEN NINETY THREE A BILL WHICH BUILDS ON THE SUCCESS OF THE CALIFORNIA EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT OR KELLY I TO SEE. BY ALLOWING INDIVIDUALS WITH FEDERAL INDIVIDUAL. TAX PAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS ALSO KNOWN AS ITUNES TO QUALIFY FOR THE CREDIT. KELLY I TO SEE WAS ELECTED IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AS A PROGRAM TO HELP LOW EARNING WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES MAKE ENDS MEET AND TO BUILD TOWARDS ECONOMIC SECURITY. MODELED AFTER THE FEDERAL YEAH I TO SEE KELLY I TO SEE PROVIDES A REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT TO PEOPLE WHO QUALIFY. BASED ON HOW MUCH THEY EARN AND HOW MANY QUALIFYING CHILDREN THEY SUPPORT. THE CREDIT REDUCES POVERTY AND ENCOURAGES WORK BY ENHANCING THE CREDIT WITH EACH. ADDITIONAL DOLLAR OF EARNING A PERSON MAKES UNTIL REACHING THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT. WHILE THE FACILITATION SUBSEQUENT EXPANSION OF KELLY I TO SEE HAVE BEEN A CRITICAL TO SUPPORTING WORKING FAMILIES. IT HAS UNFORTUNATE LEFT OUT ARE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. IMMIGRANTS. THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA ARE KEY MEMBERS OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES PAYING BILLIONS ANNUALLY IN STATE AND LOCAL TAXES. HOWEVER IMMIGRANTS A VARYING STATUS FOR USE ITUNES. FOR TAX PURPOSES ARE CURRENTLY INELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN KELLY I TO SEE. AB FIFTY NINETY THREE PROVIDES EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO INDIVIDUALS REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS TO PARTICIPATE IN A CRITICAL PROGRAM WHICH ALL ELIGIBLE. WORKING CALIFORNIANS SHOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN. BY DOING THIS WE ARE ENSURING THAT KELLY I. T. SEE WORKS TO ITS FULL POTENTIAL AND IS TRULY COMBATING POVERTY. ACROSS CALIFORNIA. YOUR TO TESTIFY. ON BEHALF OF THIS BILL ARE NO LALLI SOME THE BOND WITH THE UNITED WAY CALIFORNIA. AND SASHA FELDSTEIN WITH THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS NAY ELLIS ON THE WILD WITH THE NOT AWAY SO CALIFORNIA. UNITED WAY FIGHTS FOR THE HEALTH EDUCATION AND FINANCIAL STABILITY OF EVERY PERSON IN EVERY COMMUNITY AND TO THAT END WE'RE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR AB. FIFTY NINETY THREE EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE ECONOMIC SECURITY IN CALIFORNIA AND IN EVERY EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW HOW HARD WORK PAYS OFF HOWEVER WITHOUT ENSURING THAT ALL INCOME ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIANS WHO WORK PAY AND FILE TAXES. ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE CALLIE I TO SEE WE CANNOT FULFILL THIS MISSION OF ECONOMIC JUSTICE FOR ALL. LAST YEAR I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY% TO BE A VOLUNTEER TAX PREPARER AND CINEMA COUNTY. IT WAS TRULY REWARDING TO HELP FAMILIES CLAIM THE YEAH I TO SEE ANOTHER CREDITS WHICH CLEARLY PUT MORE MONEY IN THEIR POCKET SPECIALLY FOR MANY WHO HAD BEEN AFFECTED BY THE CINEMA FIRES. AND EXPERIENCE JOB LOSS AND LOSS WAGES DUE TO THIS THE FASTER. AT THE SAME TIME I SAW HER WORKING FAMILIES DESPITE BEING INCOME ELIGIBLE -- FOR THE EITC COULDN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT BECAUSE THEY FILED WITH THE NIGHT. TEN THESE FAMILIES WERE NO DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER HARDWORKING FAMILY TRYING TO GET AHEAD HEAD AND BUILD A BRIGHT FUTURE THEY SIMPLY FILED WITH THE NIGHT. TEN POLICE ALREADY IDENTIFIED FOR THE PURPOSE OF FILING AND PAYING THEIR TAXES SO THERE'S NO REASON THAT. THEY SHOULD BE EXCLUDED FROM THIS CRITICAL CREDIT. A THIS EXCLUSION IS MOST HARPER HARMFUL WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT IF ONE PARENT IN THE HOUSEHOLD. FILING HAS A NIGHT TEN THE ENTIRE FAMILY MISSES OUT ON THE CREDIT INCLUDING CITIZEN CHILDREN. IN FACT THE NEST THE MADE IT 74% OF HOUSEHOLDS THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM INCLUDING AYE TEN FILERS IN THE KELLY I TO SEE LIVE IN HOUSEHOLDS WITH CHILDREN. WE ALSO KNOW THAT EIGHT OUT OF TEN FAMILIES LIVING IN POVERTY ARE ACTUALLY WORKING FAMILIES AND THOSE WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM AB FIFTY NINETY THREE ARE PRIMARILY FARMWORKERS HOUSEKEEPING CLEANERS COOKS. CONSTRUCTION WORKERS JANITORS THAN MAINTENANCE WORKERS. MOST OF ALL THEY'RE PART OF OUR COMMUNITIES ARE FAMILIES NO INDIVIDUALS WHO LIVE IN POVERTY NO FAMILY SHOULD LIVE IN PART POVERTY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY NO CHILD WHO LIVE AND PARTLY. THAT IS WHY WE ARE TOO YOU'RE ABLE ON AB. FIFTY NINETY THREE THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS SASHA FELL FIFTEEN I'M A POLICY ANALYST AT THE CAN. AT THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER HI MY NAME IS SASHA FELT STEEN. WE ARE A STATE ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS TO ADVANCE INCLUSIVE POLICIES. OKAY JUST PULL IT ALL JUST GET OUT MY BACK TO YOU THEN OKAY. ARE WE ARE STAY ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS TO ADVANCE INCLUSIVE POLICIES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO EQUITY AND INCLUSION FOR ALL IMMIGRANTS TO BE ABLE TO LEARN WORK AND THRIVE IN OUR STATE'S ECONOMY. WE ARE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR AB. FIFTEEN NINETY THREE THE EITC HAS DONE MORE THAN ANY OTHER PROGRAM TO LIFT FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY. RESEARCH AND EVALUATIONS HAVE SHOWN THAT THE EITC PROMOTES EDUCATIONAL SUCCESS. BOOST LOCAL ECONOMIC GROWTH AND MOST IMPORTANT IMPROVES CHILD AND MATERNAL HEALTH. IT IS FULLY IN LINE WITH RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE LIFTING CHILDREN AND FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY TASK FORCE REPORT WHICH ACKNOWLEDGES THE POVERTY FIGHTING A FAX OF CALLIE IDC. WE KNOW THE IMMIGRANTS CONTRIBUTE ONE THIRD OF CALIFORNIANS GDP AND ARE VITAL TO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. AND WE KNOW THE IMMIGRANTS MAKE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO STATE AND LOCAL REVENUES INCLUDING UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS. YET THOUSANDS OF WORKING IMMIGRANT HOUSEHOLDS WITH A RANGE OF IMMIGRATION STATUS AS ARE CURRENTLY EXCLUDED FROM ACCESSING CALLIE ITC SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY USE AND I TEN THE EXCLUSION ALSO HARMS THOSE WHO HAVE A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. BUT LOSE THEIR DOCTOR OR TPS STATUS. THIS EXCLUSION NEGATIVELY IMPACTS ADULTS AND CHILDREN ALIKE AS MANY IMMIGRANTS LIVING MAKE STATUS HOUSEHOLDS WITH U. S. CITIZEN CHILDREN WHO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THE CALLIE IDC SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THEIR PARENTS IMMIGRATION STATUS. I'VE EXPRESSED TO YOU BEFORE HOW ARE COMMUNITIES ON THE GROUND DEEPLY UNDERSTAND HOW A MODEST TAX CREDIT COULD SOMETIMES MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PAYING FOR BASIC NEEDS. SUCH AS MEDICAL EXPENSES A CHILD'S EDUCATION OR SAVING FOR RETIREMENT OR NOT. SO I WANT TO MAKE A FEW THINGS CLEAR ONE THE BENEFITS OF AB FIFTEEN NINETY THREE WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET AND POLICY CENTER INCLUDING AYE TEN FILERS IN THE CURRENT CALLIE IDC WOULD BENEFIT FROM A HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO THOUSAND TO TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE THOUSAND MORE HOUSEHOLDS WHO ARE WORKING TO MAKE ENDS MEET. TO INCLUDING AYE TEN FILERS TARGETS CALIFORNIA'S INVESTMENTS IN FIGHTING POVERTY TO LOW INCOME WORKERS OF COLOR. CHILDREN WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM INCLUDING AYE TEN FILERS ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR. THREE INCLUDING AYE TEN FILERS TARGETS HOUSEHOLDS WITH CHILDREN. A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY 74% OF HOUSEHOLDS THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM INCLUDING AYE TEN FILERS IN THE CURRENT CALLIE I TO SEE OUR HOUSEHOLDS WITH CHILDREN. THOUSANDS OF WHOM ARE CHILDREN UNDER. SIX AB FIFTEEN NINETY THREE BY REMOVING THE EXCLUSION FOR AYE TEN FILERS MAKES ECONOMIC SENSE IS BASED ON SOUND RESEARCH THAT SUPPORTS ITS EFFICACY BUT MOST IMPORTANT IT WOULD ENSURE THAT OUR STATE'S INVESTMENTS IN FIGHTING POVERTY WORK TO FIGHT POVERTY FOR EVERY CALIFORNIAN. THEREFORE WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO SUPPORT EIGHTY FIFTEEN NINETY THREE AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR A VOTE. THANK YOU WE HAVE A QUORUM -- AS I WHEN CAN YOU. TAKE THE ROLE [inaudible] BURKE HERE. WROTE TO GRAY MAYES [inaudible] MELENDEZ MULLIN [inaudible] PETRIE-NORRIS QUIRK HERE. REVERSE. TING [inaudible] THERE. YEAH OF COURSE THANK YOU WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

THE JEWISH PUBLIC AFFAIRS COMMITTEE OF CALIFORNIA GRACE AND CALIFORNIA CHURCH IMPACT IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB. FIFTEEN NINETY THREE THANK YOU WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION YOU TODAY. GOOD AFTERNOON JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND IT LET ME PREFACE BY SAYING WE WE DON'T OBJECT AT ALL TO THE GOALS THAT ARE TRYING TO BE ACHIEVED THEIR EXTREMELY MERITORIOUS AND WE THINK THAT CREATIVE SOLUTIONS CAN BE PUT TOGETHER. TO MAKE SURE THAT ADEQUATE FUNDING AND SUPPORT IS PROVIDED THE REASON THAT WERE OPPOSED TO THE MEASURE IN ITS CURRENT FORM YOU'LL BE GETTING A NUMBER OF OTHER OPPOSE LETTERS IF ON OTHER TAX CREDITS -- VERY SHORTLY -- TAX CREDIT TO DO BECAUSE COST MONEY AND FORTY CENTS OF EVERY TAX CREDIT THAT IS CREATED ACTUALLY WOULD BE MONEY THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE GONE TO PROP NINETY EIGHT IN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS. SO IT IS ACTUALLY DIVERTING MONEY THAT WOULD HELP SCHOOLS SCHOOLS ARE IN PRE REDUCE LUNCH SO WE ARE ALREADY. MAKING SHORT -- WE'RE HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN ADEQUATELY MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS AND THESE ISSUES ARE ARE BECOMING. MORE COMPLICATED THAT THE LOCAL LEVEL YOU'RE WE'RE HEARING A LOT MORE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT -- POSSIBLE SCRIPT STRIKES BECAUSE EDUCATION FUNDING HAS NOT BEEN ADEQUATE FOR SO LONG AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS IT'S BECOMING MORE TENSE -- WE HAVE ASKED -- FOR A MORATORIUM ESSENTIALLY ON TAX CREDITS IN TILL THERE CAN BE AN ADEQUATE EVALUATION OF ALL OF THE EXISTING TAX CREDITS THAT ARE ON THE BOOKS WE LOOKED AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE EXPENDITURES FOR THE LAST DECADE. ON THE LAST DECADE CALIFORNIA PAID OUT OVER FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS IN TAX CREDITS DURING THAT SAME DECADE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT WHICH FUNDS CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS I HAD SIXTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS REDUCE WE LOST OVER. THIRTY THOUSAND TEACHING POSITIONS AND AS YOU MANY OF YOU THAT HAVE CHILDREN NO THAT THAT AMOUNT OF SERVICES THAT WERE PROVIDED IN SCHOOLS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED SO WE WOULD LIKE. TO STRONGLY ENCOURAGE OF THE AUTHOR AND THE COMMITTEE TO FIND AN ALTERNATIVE FUNDING MECHANISM FOR THE BILL BY EITHER LOOKING AT EXISTING TAX CREDITS THAT MIGHT NOT BE MEETING THE THE GOALS THEY WERE INTENDED TO IT. TO PROVIDE TO LOOK AT TRYING TO FIND SOME OF THOSE REVENUES TO REPLACE THIS WAY WE'RE NOT ADDING ON TO THE FUNDING THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN DIVERTED FROM CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS AND IF THAT COULD HAPPEN WE WOULD BE MORE THAN WILLING TO HELP TO FIND AN ADEQUATE PATH FORWARD BECAUSE WE DO. BELIEVE THAT THE I. T. C. IS VERY MERITORIOUS WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T COME ON THE BACK TO KIDS BECAUSE WE ABSOLUTELY KNOW THAT THE INTENT IS NOT. TO TAKE MORE FROM CHILDREN. ADDITIONAL WHEN WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SCENE NINE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. YEAH I HAVE A COUPLE AYE TO AND I'M NOT SURE I'M LOOKING AT THE REPUBLICAN ANALYSIS HERE AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THIS IS CORRECT IT SAYS THIS CURRENT PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO COST FOUR HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS. IS THAT IS THAT ACCURATE. WHAT'S WHAT'S THE TOTAL COSTS IN IT BUT IF IT'S NOT IT'S NOT NOT WRITTEN GREAT HERE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S WHAT THE TOTAL COST OF OF THIS. THAT IS ONE OF THE ESTIMATES THAT'S PROVIDED OKAY. AND THEN. I'VE BEEN A BIG FAN OF THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT -- IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT -- IT IT WAS -- A REPUBLICAN IDEA MIGHT CONCEPT -- IS IS THAT IF YOU GET PEOPLE WORKING AND YOU GET THEM TO BE PRODUCTIVE ANY BEGIN SET OF EYES -- THAT THAT WORK AND THEN AT SOME POINT IN TIME THEY'LL BE ENOUGH RESOURCES WHERE THEY WOULD NEED ANYMORE A GOVERNMENTAL. ASSISTANCE -- I THINK THAT THAT'S A A LAUDABLE GOAL. I'M I'M THINKING -- IN MY HEAD IN REGARDS TO TO THIS. WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IMMIGRATION STATUS BECAUSE -- IF IF YOU'VE GOT INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE HERE. WHETHER THEY ARE BOMB DOCUMENTED OR UNDOCUMENTED BUT THEY DO NOT HAVE A SOUL SECURITY HOW DO WE KNOW HOW LONG THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE. IN THIS COUNTRY ARE THEY GOING TO BE HERE FOR ONE YEAR TWO YEARS THREE YEARS FIVE YEARS OF THE INTEND TO STAY. AND SO PART OF THIS WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THE COST OF THIS THIS PROGRAM -- IS IT IS IT AT SOME POINT IN TIME YOU HAVE TO START A FACTOR THESE OTHER THESE OTHER THINGS AND AND SO I'M JUST WONDERING IF ANY -- ANALYSIS HAS BEEN DONE THAT IF WE WERE GOING TO BE -- SPENDING FOUR HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS IF THERE IS GOING TO BE A RETURN ON ON THAT INVESTMENT. CLEARLY I THINK THE RETURN ON THE INVESTMENT IS THE WORK. OR THE TAXES THAT ARE BEING PAID BY THE IMMIGRANTS -- THATWOULD BE ONE OF THEM -- ONE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW LONG THEY'RE GOING TO STAY I'M NOT SURE. IF I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION. I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT WE HAVE ASKED HOW LONG THEY'RE GOING TO SUPPORT AND THE REASON I I SAY THAT IS THIS IS NOT A NORMAL TAX CREDIT THIS IS A REFUNDABLE CREDIT. WHICH MEANS IT'S A CREDIT YOU KNOW IF YOUR TAXABLE IF YOU'RE TO TAX THE TAX CONSEQUENCES WERE TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS YOU COULD GET A CREDIT OF FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS. SO IT'S ACTUALLY MORE THAN WHAT YOU'D BE PAYING AND FOR TAXES SO PART OF THAT AGAIN IS AN INCENTIVE TO TRY TO GET FOLKS TO BE ABLE. TO TO WORK -- AND SO THERE'S THERE HAS TO BE SOME SORT OF QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS DONE HERE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INTENT OF THIS PROGRAM -- IS IS IS GOING TOWARDS -- THAT THE ULTIMATE GOAL. IF I MAY UM SO THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR ESTIMATE OF THE COST IS FOR THE CURRENT KILEY ITC STRUCTURE. THERE HAVE BEEN ESTIMATES MADE ABOUT THE COST OF INCLUDE REMOVING THE EXCLUSION FOR AYE TEN FILERS THAT'S ACTUALLY A RELATIVELY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL COST OF KELLY I. T. C.. SO THAT'S ONE THING THE SECOND THING IS THAT I I TEN NUMBERS ARE RENEWABLE SO IT'S NOT LIKE YOU ARE AND I TEN FILER AND YOU HAVE THAT I TO NUMBER NECESSARILY FOR YOUR WHOLE LIFE. AS YOU NATURALIZE AND BECOME A CITIZEN AND GET A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER YOU CAN USE THAT SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER TO FILE YOUR TAXES BUT IT IS A RENEWABLE NUMBER SO IT'S NOT AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT GETS EVALUATED. BUT OF THOSE I TO THOSE FOLKS WILL BE FILING WITH AN AYE TEN NUMBER HOW MANY OF THEM END UP STAYING IN THIS -- STAYING IN THE COUNTRY AND BECOME NATURALIZED. I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION FOR YOU BUT OKAY. I DO THINK THERE IS SOME RESEARCH THEY NAME THE AVERAGE STAY OF PEOPLE -- YOU KNOW IMMIGRANTS AND CALIFORNIA'S SO I'D BE HAPPY TO YOU KNOW RETURN SOME OF THAT INFORMATION TO TO YOUR OFFICE. I WOULD ALSO JUST ADD THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF IMMIGRANTS AND AND THERE'S A STUDY THAT I CAN SHARE ON THE NUMBER OF IMMIGRANTS WERE ACTUALLY ELIGIBLE TO NATURALIZE FOR CITIZENSHIP. BUT HAVING DONE SO FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS -- SO THEY'RE ACTUALLY PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO BE AND THIS COUNTRY AND SAY HERE BUT HAVING GONE THROUGH THAT PROCESS YET. GOOD THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER MANAGER. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS COMMENTS THE DARK QUIRK SO. I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THE ITN HOWEVER -- THE F. T. B. SAYS WITHOUT A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER IT WILL FIND IN THAT IT'LL HAVE A GREAT DEAL. OF DIFFICULTY VERIFYING TAX PAY REPORTED WAGE WITHHOLDING INFORMATION. THE LIKELIHOOD OF IMPROPER CLAIMS BY ACCIDENT OR PERHAPS FRAUDULENTLY. I WOULD YOU CARE -- TO PERHAPS EDUCATE US ON THAT POINT. I'D LIKE TO JUST SHARE WITH YOU THAT -- WHO WOULD I DO FEEL CONFIDENT THEIR SYSTEM COULD BE CREATED TO SERVE? THE UNDOCUMENTED TAXPAYERS CURRENTLY THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD HAS FOUND WAYS DESPITE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO IDENTIFY AND TRACK SELF EMPLOYED WORKERS ALTHOUGH THE INITIAL BARRIERS TO DO SO WERE THOUGHT TO BE TOO STEEP. IN ADDITION THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD IDENTIFIES CURRENT AYE TEEN FILERS FOR THE PURPOSE OF FILING AND COLLECTING TAXES. SO WOULD BE EQUITABLE TO WORK TO FIND WAYS FOR THEM TO BENEFIT FROM TAX CREDITS AS WELL. IF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TAKE MONEY FROM FOLKS AND IDENTIFY THEM FOR SOME TAX PURPOSES. I THINK WE DO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO FIND PATHWAYS FOR THEM TO ACCESS A TAX CREDIT. MEANT TO BRING CALIFORNIANS OUT OF POVERTY YEAH I JUST SUGGEST THAT YOU TAKE THE TIME OR YOUR STAFF TAKE THE TIME TO GO OVER. AND TALK TO THEM ABOUT IT AND SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU CAN DO AND THE BAIL TO RELIEVE THEIR CONCERNS VERY GOOD THANK YOU DOCTOR THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS CONCERNS. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL OBVIOUSLY -- LEAVING POVERTY IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO ME AND AND THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE SOCIETY CONTRIBUTING TO CALIFORNIA. AND LIFTING THESE FAMILIES ON THESE CHILDREN OUT OF POVERTY OR JUST JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THOSE WITH SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL TO LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WHEN YOU ALL BRING IT OUT OF THE INFORMATIONAL SESSION -- BUT RIGHT. THIS IS A WHOLE NEW PROCESS. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU.

CALIFORNIA STATE COMMANDERS VETERANS COUNCIL THE NATIONAL GUARD ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA IN VIETNAM VETERANS OF AMERICA. CALIFORNIA STATE COUNCIL ALL OF WHICH ARE IN SUPPORT OF AB. TWELVE FIFTY EIGHT THE BILL WILL HELP THE BETTERING GROUPS WERE REPRESENTED BY EXEMPTING INCOME TAX FROM ACTIVE DUTY PAY AND FROM RETIREMENT PAY. FOR THAT Q. MILITANTS TIME OFF ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE AFTER A SERVICE MEMBER HAS BEEN HONORABLY DISCHARGED. THIS BILL WILL HELP VETERANS WHO MEET BE STRUGGLING FINANCIALLY AND WILL ALSO REWARD THOSE WHO HAVE SERVED. THEIR COUNTRY. AB TWELVE FIFTY EIGHT IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN A TIME WHERE WE ARE SEEN VETERANS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY HOMELESSNESS. AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. WE SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION WHICH WILL ENCOURAGE ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE MEMBERS TO STAY IN CALIFORNIA UPON DISCHARGE AND WILL HELP THOUSANDS OF VETERANS WHO MIGHT BE STRUGGLING FINANCIALLY. THIS INCOME TAX EXEMPTION WILL HELP ACTIVE DUTY MEMBERS AND VETERANS WHO MAY BE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET. AND WILL ALSO SERVE AS AN INCENTIVE FOR MORE SERVICE MEMBERS TO REMAIN IN CALIFORNIA.

MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COURT WITH THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION -- AS IS THE CASE WITH MANY BILLS OF THIS NATURE WHILE PLEASE CONSIDER TO BE MERITORIOUS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS WE DO HAVE CONCERNS -- IN PARTICULAR -- THE MEASURE SEEKS TO PROVIDE AND IT TAX EXPENDITURE AN EXEMPTION ESSENTIALLY -- FOR VETERANS REGARDLESS OF THEIR INCOME STATUS SO EVEN THOSE WHO HAVE NO NEED TO NECESSARILY BENEFIT FROM SUCH. A BENEFIT WOULD IN FACT RECEIVED QUITE A GENEROUS CREDIT -- IN ADDITION WE BELIEVE THAT VETERANS IN THE STATE PARTICULAR THOSE WHO ARE CERTAINLY HOMELESS AND IN NEED OF SERVICES WOULD BE BETTER SERVED BY. A TARGETED PROGRAM A GRANT OR A DIRECT EXPENDITURE AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE DO OPPOSE THE BILL AS WRITTEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL IN OPPOSITION SEEING NONE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FOR THE COMMITTEE. BURKE FROM JUST TO SAY I AGREE WITH THE OPPOSITION BUT PERHAPS YOU CAN CONVINCE ME OTHERWISE BUT I HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS. YEAH AND THOSE WERE -- THROUGH THE CHAIR THOSE WERE AMENDMENTS THAT WE WERE OPEN TO CLARIFY WITHIN MINUTES OR SUBMITTED TO TRY TO NARROW THE COST. OR LOOKING AT DISHONORABLE DISCHARGES BUT ALSO LOOKING AT ONLY THEIR ACTIVE DUTY PAY AND ALSO. THE RETIREMENT PAY SO YOU'RE ACTUALLY LIMITING IT TO ONLY THAT TYPE OF INCOME AND NOT ALL INCOME. AND SO WE WERE MINDFUL OF THE EXPENSES AND SO THIS IS ONE WE WERE DOING IT WE'RE TRYING TO COME UP -- WHAT WITH THE WAY AS HOW CAN WE HONOR VETERANS AND ONE OF THE? MECHANISMS WE CAME ABOUT IS LIKE WELL IF YOU SERVE FOR FOUR YEARS AND MAYBE WE CAN GIVE YOU THIS CREDIT FOR FOUR YEARS IF YOUR HONOR PLEASE DESTRUCTION ONLY ON ACTIVE DUTY PAY. AND YOUR RETIREMENT PAY SO THEN IT WHAT IT DOES IS IT. IT BRINGS ACOSTA ACT AND SO THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE'RE WORKING THROUGH -- THROUGH THE COMMITTEE WITH AS WELL GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU. WHATEVER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE WE APPRECIATE IT WOULD YOU LIKE CLOSE.

THEY'RE SPENDING -- DE TENDS TIME MORE OF WHAT THEIR ACTUAL TRANSPORTATION ALLOCATION IS SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ADEQUATELY FUNDED IN SO FIRES ARE IMPACTING THEM AS WELL.

ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. CALIFORNIA CONSISTENTLY IS A LEADER IN THE NATION IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC VALUE TALLY AND INNOVATION AND THIS BILL AB. THREE SIXTY FOUR WOULD EXEMPT PASSED THROUGH BUSINESSES FROM PAYING THE MINIMUM ANNUAL TAX FOR THEIR FIRST YEAR OF OPERATION. THIS IS THE SAME EXEMPTION PROVIDED TO NEW CORPORATIONS DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF OPERATE FIRST OPERATING YEAR. CURRENTLY THE STATE IMPOSES AN ANNUAL MINIMUM FRANCHISE TAX OF EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS ON BUSINESSES THAT OPERATE WITHIN ITS BORDERS WHILE ALL CORPORATIONS ARE EXEMPT FROM THE TAX WITHIN THEIR FIRST YEAR OF OPERATION. PASTOR BUSINESSES A STRUGGLE WITH CASH FLOW ARE NOT AFFORDED THE SAME EXEMPTION. WE NEED LONG TERM OR PERMANENT SOLUTIONS TO INCENTIVIZE NEW BUSINESSES THIS BILL WILL WORK TO IMPROVE CALIFORNIA'S BUSINESS CLIMATE. AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR BUSINESSES AND ENTREPRENEURS TO REMAIN. COMPETITIVE AS A CALIFORNIA BASED BUSINESS IN THIS GLOBAL ECONOMY EXEMPTING NEW SMALL BUSINESSES FROM HAVING TO PAY THEIR FIRST MINIMUM ANNUAL TAX WILL BE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. IN A LEVY A IN THE COST RESTRAINTS NEW BUSINESSES FACE DURING THEIR FIRST YEAR OPERATING WHEN I CAME UP HERE I WORKED ON A BILL -- THEY HAD TO DO A SMALL BUSINESSES I MET WITH A BUNCH OF ENTREPRENEURS AND I ASKED HIM IF THERE'S ONE THING IF YOU COULD JUST WRITE YOUR OWN LAW TO CHANGE ONE THING WHAT WOULD IT BE AND WOULD BE A HUNDRED DOLLARS. EVERY YEAR THAT THEY GOT TO PAY WHEN THEY'RE TRYING OR WITH THE FIRST YEAR THAT THEY GOT A PAY TO TO GET STARTED AND I SAID SO. YOU CAN GET RID OF ANY REGULATION YOU COULD DO ANYTHING ELSE THIS THE ONE THING YOU DO IS A GAP BECAUSE CASH FLOW MIGHT SOUND LIKE A SMALL AMOUNT HE HAD A DOLLARS ACTUALLY REALLY MATTERS TO A SUMMER'S GETTING STARTED. AS A NEW BUSINESS SO -- I IT'S IS THIS IS -- THE RIGHT A GOOD STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK ARRIVE VOTE WHEN THIS BILL IS UP FOR CONSIDERATION FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION SEEING NONE CALLING THE QUESTION FOR THE COMMITTEE. START QUIRK. SO THE INTENTION HERE IS WHAT TYPE OF CORPORATION YOU SAID PASSED THROUGH CORPORATIONS SMALL BUSINESSES SO RIGHT NOW IF YOU'RE CORPORATION YOUR FIRST YEAR'S EXAM I WANT. TO I WANT TO ALSO ALLOW SMALL BUSINESSES THE SAME EXEMPTION OF THE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR SO WHAT IT DOES IN THE ANALYSIS IS THAT THEY COULD JUST DO A SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP. AND WE SEE THIS FOR ALL OF THESE TYPES OF BILLS SET DO A SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP. THAT BY HAVING A LIMITED LIABILITY CORPORATION -- OR A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP THEY'RE GETTING THE SPECIAL BENEFIT -- TO BASICALLY SHIELDING THEIR PERSONAL. WEALTH AND THEREFORE -- THERE IS REASON TO CHARGE ADDITIONALLY -- PERHAPS YOU COULD TO ADDRESS THAT. OUR WELL AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED YOU KNOW. MAYBE I COULD COME BACK TO YOU WHEN IT COMES TO THE SHIELDING OF WEALTH THAT'S NOT MY INTERPRETATION THE INTENT HERE IS THE FOCUS ON ANYBODY. THAT HAS YOU KNOW IF WE'RE GONNA FORD AND AN EXEMPTION FROM UP FOR CORPORATION ORDER TO WAIVE THE FIRST YEAR OF A HUNDRED DOLLARS I THINK THAT THERE ANY PASTOR BUSINESS OR ANY OTHER SMALL BUSINESS. SHOULD BE AFFORDED THAT SAME ABILITY -- UNDER OUR LAWS. THANK YOU. I GET A CHECK. A MISTER CALDERON I JUST WANT TO COMPLIMENT SHE EVEN FOCUS ON THIS MINIMUM TAX SINCE YOU'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE YOU'VE GOT SEVERAL ITERATIONS OF THIS BUT I LIKE TO BE ADDED ON AS A CO AUTHOR I LOOK FOR TO VOTING IN FAVOR OF IT WHEN IT COMES UP.

UNTIL SHE GETS BACK WILL TAKE A LITTLE BREAK [inaudible] THANK YOU BY MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB THIRTEEN NINETY SEVEN REDUCES GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND INCREASES ECONOMIC ACTIVITY ACROSS THE STATE PROVIDING A TAX CREDIT TO IMPROVE OUR SHORTLINE RAILROAD INFRASTRUCTURE. A SHORT LINE RAILROAD IS A SMALL OR MIDSIZE RAILROAD COMPANY THAT OPERATES OVER RELATIVELY SHORT DISTANCE COMPARED TO LARGER NATIONAL ROAD NETWORKS. YOU CAN THINK OF A SHORTLINE RAILROAD AS THE FIRST AND LAST MY LOVE A TRIP. BECAUSE TRAINS ARE THE THREE TO FIVE TIMES MORE FUEL EFFICIENT THAN TRUCKS. CONNECTING FREIGHT TO REAL REDUCES BOTTLENECK IN CONJUNCTION CONGESTION AND RESULT IN LESS WEAR AND TEAR ON OUR ROADS AND HIGHWAYS WHICH CAN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. IMPROVING SHORT LINE INFRASTRUCTURE ALSO INCREASES LOCALIZE AND STATEWIDE ECONOMIC BENEFITS. FOR SHORT LINE INFRASTRUCTURE MAINTAINS CALIFORNIA'S POSITION AS A GLOBAL LEADER IN COMPETITOR FOR GOODS MOVEMENT SECOND CHARLAINE RAILROADS. ALSO ALLOW CONTINUED ACCESS TO RULE PARTS OF THE STATE ENSURING THAT THAT LOCAL COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO ADD JOBS AND INCREASE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. AB THIRTEEN NINETY SEVEN WILL KEEP CALIFORNIA COMPETITIVE BY INCENTIVIZE INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE ABOVE AND BEYOND CURRENT MAINTENANCE SCHEDULES. I HAVE HERE WITH US THE ASSISTANT VICE PRESIDENT OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR JANICE IN WYOMING HERE TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. AND AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME YOUR QUESTION I THOUGHT. WITH THIS SPORT I MISTER VICE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JEFF AND SHAKEN AND THE AB PEOPLE REFERS FOR JANICE IN WYOMING IN OUR SIX SHORT LINE RAILROADS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I'M HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB. THIRTEEN NINETY SEVEN IN CALIFORNIA SHORELINES OPERATE IT 11% OF THE FREE TRAFFIC. THE SHORELINES EXIST TO SERVE PARTS OF THE STATE WERE TRACK WAS HELD BY PREVIOUS OWNERS BUT SPUN OFF DUE TO LACK OF INVESTMENT. AND LACK OF CUSTOMER VOLUME AS A RESULT THE SPINE OFF ASSETS SUFFERED FROM YEARS OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IN AN ACTIVE MARKETING. SURELY COMPANIES LIKE THE CALIFORNIA NORTHERN RAILROAD BODIES UNDERPERFORMING BRANCH LINES TO REVITALIZE THEM ALONG RURAL CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES IN CUSTOMER SERVICE QUALITY GRAIN AND AND C. P. WEST TO MAINTAIN ACCESS TO THE NATIONAL FOR A REAL NETWORK. THE CALIFORNIA RIGHT STATE RAIL PLAN SAYS IT BEST ON PAGE ONE SEVENTY AND I QUOTE. THE PRINCIPLE CHALLENGE THAT MUST BE ADDRESSES THAT SOME OF THE STATE SHORT LINE TRACKAGE CANNOT HANDLE FREIGHT CARS WING TO HURRY SIX THOUSAND POUND A STANDARD THAT CLASS ONE RAILROADS ADOPTED IN. NINETEEN NINETY FOUR WERE LINE IS NOT TO EIGHTY SIX K. CAPABLE THE COMMON PRACTICE IS TO EITHER LOAD A RAIL CAR TO LESS THAN ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY OR TO TRANSFER THE LOADED TRUCKS FOR TRANSPORT TO LOCATION WHERE THE RAILROAD CAN HANDLE THE HEAVIER LOAD. BOTH PRACTICES UNNECESSARILY INCREASE COSTS THROUGH THE INEFFICIENT USE OF ASSETS THE ADDITIONAL STEPS REQUIRED AND THE INCREASE TRAVEL TIME AND QUOTE. THIRTY THREE OTHER STATES PROVIDE PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY TO HELP SMALLER FREIGHT RAILROAD INFRASTRUCTURE CALIFORNIA'S NOTICEABLY ABSENT FROM THAT LIST. THE PUBLIC BENEFITS TO CALIFORNIA IN CREATING A PROGRAM THROUGH THE PROPOSED SHORELINE TAX CREDIT ARE CLEAR. IMPROVED AIR QUALITY THROUGH FEWER TRUCKS IN CALIFORNIA ROADWAYS. FEWER TRUCKS RESULT IN LESS ROADWAY CONGESTION AND IMPROVE HIGHWAY SAFETY. THE BILL WAS SUPPORTED DIVERSE BASE OF AGRICULTURE MANUFACTURING SECTORS OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ECONOMY THAT NEED SHORT LINE RAILROADS TO REACH THEIR CUSTOMERS OR SUPPLIERS EFFICIENTLY. AND IT WILL IMPROVE TRANSPORTATION CONNECTIVITY TO AREAS OF THE STATE THAT ARE OFTEN RURAL AND WITH FEWER OPTIONS FOR GOODS MOVEMENT. APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THIS LEGISLATION THANK YOU INITIAL AND THIS IS A SUPPORT. IS A GERMAN MEMBERS MIKE ANDERSON WITH THE SMART TRANSPORTATION DIVISION FORMALLY UNITED TRANSPORTATION UNION. AND WE REPRESENT THE OPERATING EMPLOYEES ON MANY SHORT LINES IN CALIFORNIA.
