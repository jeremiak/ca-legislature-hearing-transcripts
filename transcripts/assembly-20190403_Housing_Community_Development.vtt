INSTEAD COMMIT TO FINDING AN

01:05:30.793 --> 01:05:32.228
ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION THAT DOES

NOT DISCOURAGE FARMERS FROM

01:07:56.238 --> 01:07:58.274
ALL STAKEHOLDERS AND ULTIMATELY

01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:00.609
WE CREATED A BILL THAT -- IS

01:08:00.676 --> 01:08:02.077
SIMPLY AN OPTION YOU KNOW NOBODY

01:08:02.144 --> 01:08:04.180
HAS TO UTILIZE -- THIS BILL --

01:08:04.246 --> 01:08:05.047
BUT CERTAINLY IT DOES ADDRESS

01:08:05.114 --> 01:08:06.682
THE NEED FOR THE DISTRICT AND I

01:08:06.749 --> 01:08:08.651
THINK -- MANY OF US WILL AGREE

01:08:08.717 --> 01:08:09.785
THAT THIS IS A BILL YOU KNOW

01:08:09.852 --> 01:08:12.054
THAT MOST POLICY THAT COMES OUT

01:08:12.121 --> 01:08:12.888
OF THIS BUILDING SHOULD BE

01:08:12.955 --> 01:08:14.190
DRIVEN BY GOOD DATA.

01:08:14.256 --> 01:08:15.891
AND SO DATA WAS THIS IT WAS IT

01:08:15.958 --> 01:08:17.893
WAS THE PRIMARY REASON WHY YOU

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:18.994
KNOW WE CREATE THIS BILL AND

01:08:19.061 --> 01:08:19.929
WHEN AND WHY SAY ABOUT DATA IN

01:08:19.995 --> 01:08:21.230
JULY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THERE

01:08:21.297 --> 01:08:22.531
WAS A FARM WORKER HOUSING STUDY

01:08:22.598 --> 01:08:23.999
AN ACTION PLAN.

01:08:24.066 --> 01:08:27.470
THAT WAS RELEASED -- IT WAS --

01:08:27.536 --> 01:08:28.704
IT WAS CONDUCTED.

01:08:28.771 --> 01:08:31.106
SO IT WAS RELEASED IN JULY BUT

01:08:31.173 --> 01:08:32.374
WAS CONDUCTED BY THE SALINAS

01:08:32.441 --> 01:08:34.810
APOLLO VALLEY'S -- AND WHAT THE

01:08:34.877 --> 01:08:36.579
STUDY SAID IS IT IT COME FROM

01:08:36.645 --> 01:08:38.747
THE AGRICULTURAL WORKERS ARE

01:08:38.814 --> 01:08:41.350
LIVING AND SEVERELY OVERCROWDED --

01:08:41.417 --> 01:08:41.917
THESE CONDITIONS SUBSTANDARD

01:08:41.984 --> 01:08:43.619
CONDITIONS -- AND THE STUDY

01:08:43.686 --> 01:08:44.720
DEMONSTRATED THAT THERE WAS A

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:49.391
PREPONDERANCE OF WORKERS THAT

01:08:49.458 --> 01:08:50.526
WERE YEAR ROUND RESIDENTS.

01:08:50.593 --> 01:08:52.895
AND THOSE THAT WERE SURVEYED 75%

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:53.529
OF THE PEOPLE I WAS A WE WERE

01:08:53.596 --> 01:08:54.563
MARRIED AND OFTEN LIVE IN A

01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:55.798
HOUSEHOLD WITH MINOR CHILDREN

01:08:55.865 --> 01:08:57.433
AND SO THE BASICALLY THIS DATA

01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:58.300
WHAT.

01:08:58.367 --> 01:08:59.468
THE YOU KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL

01:08:59.535 --> 01:09:01.637
PLAN SUGGESTED WAS THAT MUCH OF

01:09:01.704 --> 01:09:03.272
THE FOCUS THAT HAS BEEN PUT ON

01:09:03.339 --> 01:09:04.540
ON ON HOUSING FOR TEMPORARY

01:09:04.607 --> 01:09:05.975
FARMWORKERS.

01:09:06.041 --> 01:09:07.243
THAT THE DATA THAT WAS

01:09:07.309 --> 01:09:08.777
SIGNIFICANTLY CLEAR THAT THE

01:09:08.844 --> 01:09:10.412
MOST SIGNIFICANT NEED WAS FOR

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:12.748
PERMANENT FARM WORKER FAMILY

01:09:12.815 --> 01:09:14.216
HOUSING AND SO CERTAINLY.

01:09:14.283 --> 01:09:15.351
YOU KNOW IN A PERFECT WORLD

01:09:15.417 --> 01:09:17.086
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS WOULD

01:09:17.152 --> 01:09:18.220
GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER CONGRESS

01:09:18.287 --> 01:09:20.990
AND FIX IMMIGRATION -- THE WE

01:09:21.056 --> 01:09:21.557
SHOULDN'T BE DEPENDING ON A

01:09:21.624 --> 01:09:23.993
GUEST WORKER PROGRAM -- YOU KNOW

01:09:24.059 --> 01:09:25.628
FOR ALL THESE YEARS THAT WE HAVE --

01:09:25.694 --> 01:09:26.929
CERTAINLY THIS IS A POLITICAL

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:28.797
ISSUE AND CONGRESS THESE DO

01:09:28.864 --> 01:09:29.999
SOMETHING AND AND GET REAL ABOUT

01:09:30.065 --> 01:09:31.800
IMMIGRATION REFORM -- BUT THIS

01:09:31.867 --> 01:09:34.403
IS CERTAINLY A STATE SOLUTION.

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:36.138
TO A STATEWIDE PROBLEM -- AND

01:09:36.205 --> 01:09:41.844
THAT'S WHAT WE OUR ATTENDED TO

01:09:41.911 --> 01:09:44.480
CONSERVE THIS BILL.

01:09:44.547 --> 01:09:45.814
AND AGAIN JUST A TO RESPOND TO

01:09:45.881 --> 01:09:46.782
SOME OF THE COMMENTS -- AGAIN

01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:48.350
THIS BILL IS OPTIONAL IT DOES

01:09:48.417 --> 01:09:51.186
NOT LIMIT ANY GROWER OR OTHER

01:09:51.253 --> 01:09:52.588
AGRICULTURE ENTERPRISE FROM

01:09:52.655 --> 01:09:54.323
DEVELOPING HOUSING FARMER

01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:56.091
HOUSING WHAT IT DOES IS.

01:09:56.158 --> 01:09:57.526
EXEMPT THEM FROM THE PROCESS

01:09:57.593 --> 01:09:59.929
UNLESS THEY AGREED TO WORK WITH

01:09:59.995 --> 01:10:00.729
A THIRD PARTY.

01:10:00.796 --> 01:10:02.398
CURRENTLY MANY GROWERS AND

01:10:02.464 --> 01:10:03.866
OPERATORS WORK WITH THIRD

01:10:03.933 --> 01:10:05.367
PARTIES TO PROVIDE THEIR HOUSING

01:10:05.434 --> 01:10:06.969
ANYWAY YEAH IT'S NOT A HUGE

01:10:07.036 --> 01:10:08.637
CHANGE FROM THE BUSINESS

01:10:08.704 --> 01:10:10.539
PRACTICE THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS --

01:10:10.606 --> 01:10:12.474
THERE BEEN A NUMBER OF AB

01:10:12.541 --> 01:10:16.712
EXAMPLES WHERE THAT'S THE CASE

01:10:16.779 --> 01:10:18.681
MONTEREY COUNTY -- THAT THIS

01:10:18.747 --> 01:10:20.182
BILL DOESN'T CHANGE ANY OF THAT

01:10:20.249 --> 01:10:22.885
AND ALL OF THOSE OPTIONS ARE

01:10:22.952 --> 01:10:25.087
STILL AVAILABLE.

01:10:25.154 --> 01:10:26.255
THANK YOU -- IS LIMóN.

01:10:26.322 --> 01:10:27.222
THANK YOU THANK YOU AT TO THE

01:10:27.289 --> 01:10:29.291
AUTHOR I HAVE A QUESTION FOR

01:10:29.358 --> 01:10:30.960
OPPOSITION AND I DON'T KNOW IF

01:10:31.026 --> 01:10:34.163
WE CAN GET OPPOSITION.

01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:36.765
SO ONE OF THE THE ELEMENTS IT'S

01:10:36.832 --> 01:10:38.133
BEEN MENTIONED MULTIPLE TIMES IS

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:40.402
THAT THIS BILL IS OPTIONAL.

01:10:40.469 --> 01:10:43.038
AND DOES NOT IT DOES NOT HAVE TO

01:10:43.105 --> 01:10:45.307
BE ADOPTED BY ANY -- FARMER THAT

01:10:45.374 --> 01:10:46.809
DOES NOT CAN YOU RESPOND TO THAT

01:10:46.875 --> 01:10:48.811
AND WHY YOU WOULD STILL OPPOSE

01:10:48.877 --> 01:10:50.879
SOMETHING THAT'S OPTIONAL NOT

01:10:50.946 --> 01:10:52.681
REQUIRED.

01:10:52.748 --> 01:10:53.983
IT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION -- I

01:10:54.049 --> 01:10:55.517
PROBABLY A COUPLE POINTS ON THAT --

01:10:55.584 --> 01:10:56.518
THERE'S DEFINITELY A LABOR

01:10:56.585 --> 01:10:58.187
SHORTAGE ISSUE OUT THERE AND

01:10:58.253 --> 01:11:00.389
WERE HAVING ISSUES REALLY THE

01:11:00.456 --> 01:11:00.856
NIMBY.

01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:01.390
NIMBY AS AND WHEN THAT'S

01:11:01.457 --> 01:11:02.825
OCCURRING UNFORTUNATELY

01:11:02.891 --> 01:11:05.294
REGARDING FARMER HOUSING -- AND

01:11:05.361 --> 01:11:08.764
WE BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW THE THE

01:11:08.831 --> 01:11:11.600
THE THE ISSUE COMES.

01:11:11.667 --> 01:11:14.570
TO IT'S A CRISIS -- IT'S IT'S

01:11:14.637 --> 01:11:16.038
WERE PICKING UP PRODUCTION AG

01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:18.007
LAND ACTUALLY SITE THE HOUSING

01:11:18.073 --> 01:11:19.708
USING OUR OWN CAPITAL WE'RE

01:11:19.775 --> 01:11:20.943
GOING TO STILL BE ALIVE ON

01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:22.411
RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT.

01:11:22.478 --> 01:11:24.113
AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATE

01:11:24.179 --> 01:11:24.747
SHOULD HAVE BEEN A MINISTER OR

01:11:24.813 --> 01:11:26.248
MINISTER PERMITTING PROCESS FOR

01:11:26.315 --> 01:11:27.883
THIS TYPE OF HOUSING YEARS AGO

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:29.351
BECAUSE REALLY NOT ARGUING ABOUT

01:11:29.418 --> 01:11:30.519
IS OWNING TYPE ISSUE.

01:11:30.586 --> 01:11:33.288
WE'RE REALLY CONCERNED THAT A

01:11:33.355 --> 01:11:35.224
BILL THAT THIS BILL PICKETT

01:11:35.290 --> 01:11:37.026
SIGNED -- GETS UP DOWNSTAIRS THE

01:11:37.092 --> 01:11:38.360
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND GET SIGNED.

01:11:38.427 --> 01:11:39.061
THAT IS REALLY NOT GONNA LEAD TO

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:41.163
MORE HOUSING GOING IN BECAUSE WE

01:11:41.230 --> 01:11:41.897
HAVE.

01:11:41.964 --> 01:11:43.766
A LOT OF A GROWERS ARE JUST NOT

01:11:43.832 --> 01:11:45.668
GOING TO TURN THE KEYS OVER IN

01:11:45.734 --> 01:11:47.069
ORDER TO FOLLOW THE MINISTER

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:48.604
PERMITTING PROCESS.

01:11:48.671 --> 01:11:49.538
AND WE COME BACK NEXT YEAR AND

01:11:49.605 --> 01:11:51.407
SAY WE HAVE AN ADDRESS THE

01:11:51.473 --> 01:11:53.208
PROBLEM -- THAT WE'RE STILL

01:11:53.275 --> 01:11:54.843
HAVING A A FORMER HOUSING

01:11:54.910 --> 01:11:56.078
SHORTAGE OF THAT WERE

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:57.379
UNFORTUNATE TO BE TOLD THAT WE

01:11:57.446 --> 01:11:58.814
TRY TO DRESS AT LAST YEAR AND

01:11:58.881 --> 01:11:59.782
WE'RE WORRIED.

01:11:59.848 --> 01:12:01.650
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT IS REALLY A

01:12:01.717 --> 01:12:09.458
CRISIS AND WE LIKE OUR HANDS ARE

01:12:09.525 --> 01:12:12.227
BEING TIED UNNECESSARILY.

01:12:12.294 --> 01:12:14.029
THANKS FOR THE FEEDBACK I GUESS

01:12:14.096 --> 01:12:14.763
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE.

01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:15.397
THIS IS ONLY MY MY THIRTY YEAR

01:12:15.464 --> 01:12:15.998
ON THE HOUSING COMMITTEE AND I

01:12:16.065 --> 01:12:16.632
FEEL LIKE WE CONTINUE TO BRING

01:12:16.699 --> 01:12:17.700
TOOLS KNOWING THAT NOT ONE TOOL

01:12:17.766 --> 01:12:18.600
IS THE FINAL SOLUTION.

01:12:18.667 --> 01:12:19.401
SO I GUESS THERE'S AN

01:12:19.468 --> 01:12:21.270
EXPECTATION ON MY PART THAT WE

01:12:21.336 --> 01:12:22.471
WILL COME BACK NEXT YEAR

01:12:22.538 --> 01:12:23.739
INDEPENDENT OF THIS BILL GET

01:12:23.806 --> 01:12:25.307
SIGNED OR NOT BECAUSE WE NEED

01:12:25.374 --> 01:12:27.509
MORE THAN ONE TOOL FOR DIFFERENT

01:12:27.576 --> 01:12:30.879
COMMUNITIES -- AND CERTAINLY

01:12:30.946 --> 01:12:32.715
THIS ISSUE AT I THINK BOTH THE

01:12:32.781 --> 01:12:35.517
SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION MENTON

01:12:35.584 --> 01:12:36.618
THE CENTRAL COAST WHICH IS --

01:12:36.685 --> 01:12:37.753
THE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT

01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:39.021
AND BOTH ENTER AND SANTA BARBARA

01:12:39.088 --> 01:12:41.223
COUNTY HAVE AG AG IS VERY

01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:42.925
IMPORTANT TO BOTH OF THOSE

01:12:42.991 --> 01:12:44.993
COUNTIES -- BUT WE CAN'T HAVE AG

01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:46.795
ACCURATE AG PRODUCTION WITHOUT

01:12:46.862 --> 01:12:49.231
FARMWORKERS -- AND THE HOUSING

01:12:49.298 --> 01:12:50.999
ISSUE CONTINUES TO BE -- ONE I

01:12:51.066 --> 01:12:52.601
KNOW THAT THE AUTHOR AND I HAVE

01:12:52.668 --> 01:12:55.437
HAD MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONS I AND

01:12:55.504 --> 01:12:57.306
THE OTHER THAT YOU KNOW ELEMENT

01:12:57.372 --> 01:12:58.841
THAT I'VE EXPRESSED AND IN TERMS

01:12:58.907 --> 01:13:01.043
OF MY CONCERN AND THIS HAS GONE

01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:02.911
FOR A NUMBER OF OF BILLS THAT

01:13:02.978 --> 01:13:04.279
WE'VE SEEN NOT JUST AROUND

01:13:04.346 --> 01:13:05.647
HOUSING DEVELOPMENT BUT OTHER

01:13:05.714 --> 01:13:06.615
DEVELOPMENT.

01:13:06.682 --> 01:13:09.651
IS WHEN WE FAST FORWARD -- OR

01:13:09.718 --> 01:13:13.355
STREAMLINER AT WHATEVER RATE.

01:13:13.422 --> 01:13:15.457
AT WORD OF THE DAY WE DECIDE --

01:13:15.524 --> 01:13:17.392
SOME ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS

01:13:17.459 --> 01:13:19.294
IN THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT --

01:13:19.361 --> 01:13:21.163
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE

01:13:21.230 --> 01:13:23.932
INTERFACE BETWEEN URBAN AND AG

01:13:23.999 --> 01:13:24.967
CREATES COMPLICATIONS.

01:13:25.033 --> 01:13:30.305
AND THERE ARE A I THINK HAVING

01:13:30.372 --> 01:13:32.040
LIVED AND CONTINUING TO LIVE

01:13:32.107 --> 01:13:34.009
SOME OF THE COMPLICATIONS --

01:13:34.076 --> 01:13:36.011
THAT IT CREATES -- I THINK WE DO

01:13:36.078 --> 01:13:37.679
HAVE TO BE VERY SENSITIVE TO

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:40.115
WHAT IT MEANS AT TO BUILD IN AN

01:13:40.182 --> 01:13:41.750
AREA -- WHERE URBAN AND NAGY

01:13:41.817 --> 01:13:43.552
INTERFACE -- WHERE IS THAT

01:13:43.619 --> 01:13:45.087
COMMUNITY CHANGES -- THE

01:13:45.154 --> 01:13:46.288
CONCERNS MIGHT BE DIFFERENT

01:13:46.355 --> 01:13:47.956
TODAY THAN THEY WILL BE IN TEN

01:13:48.023 --> 01:13:49.725
YEARS -- CERTAINLY WE'VE SEEN

01:13:49.792 --> 01:13:53.028
THAT -- AND HAPPEN AND SO I I

01:13:53.095 --> 01:13:54.096
WANT.

01:13:54.163 --> 01:13:56.732
I WORRY SOMETIMES THAT WE FAST

01:13:56.799 --> 01:13:57.933
FORWARD OR STREAMLINE

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.569
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS -- IN

01:14:00.636 --> 01:14:01.970
ORDER TO GET SOMETHING DONE

01:14:02.037 --> 01:14:03.972
BECAUSE THE NEED IS SO HIGH AND

01:14:04.039 --> 01:14:06.041
I THINK THERE'S MERIT IN HAVING

01:14:06.108 --> 01:14:07.709
THAT CONVERSATION BUT

01:14:07.776 --> 01:14:09.545
PARTICULARLY AROUND FARM WORKER

01:14:09.611 --> 01:14:10.512
HOUSING.

01:14:10.579 --> 01:14:12.748
IN COMMUNITIES WHERE AG AND

01:14:12.815 --> 01:14:14.216
URBAN INTERFACE IN A VERY

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:15.417
DIFFERENT WAY THAN IN RURAL

01:14:15.484 --> 01:14:18.821
COMMUNITIES -- I I WORRY I ALSO

01:14:18.887 --> 01:14:21.356
WORRY -- I KNOW THAT DEPENDING

01:14:21.423 --> 01:14:23.826
ON THE SIDE THAT PEOPLE ARE ON

01:14:23.892 --> 01:14:25.394
THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS

01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:27.062
AND REVIEW PROCESS CAN BE USED

01:14:27.129 --> 01:14:29.498
AS A SORT FOR BOTH SIDES.

01:14:29.565 --> 01:14:31.366
AND I ALSO FIND THAT

01:14:31.433 --> 01:14:33.035
DISPROPORTIONATELY COMMUNITIES

01:14:33.101 --> 01:14:35.971
OF COLOR ARE ON THE NOT SO GREAT

01:14:36.038 --> 01:14:37.906
RECEIVING SIDE OF THIS -- IT

01:14:37.973 --> 01:14:39.708
MEANING THAT SOMETIMES WE OVER

01:14:39.775 --> 01:14:42.678
RIGHT PROTECTIONS -- Là AND WE

01:14:42.744 --> 01:14:44.046
FIND OURSELVES THE COMMUNITIES

01:14:44.112 --> 01:14:46.081
OF COLOR ARE IN AREAS WITH THE

01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:48.483
WORST AIR QUALITY WITH -- WATER

01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:50.519
ISSUES WITH LAND CONTAMINATION

01:14:50.586 --> 01:14:52.621
ISSUES BECAUSE THERE WAS SOME

01:14:52.688 --> 01:14:53.355
ELEMENTS THAT WERE FAST

01:14:53.422 --> 01:14:56.124
FORWARDED -- AND I ALSO KNOW

01:14:56.191 --> 01:14:58.160
THAT SOMETIMES ENVIRONMENT

01:14:58.227 --> 01:14:59.528
ENVIRONMENT TO PROTECTIONS.

01:14:59.595 --> 01:15:01.997
THAT CAN BE USED -- BY FOLKS.

01:15:02.064 --> 01:15:04.266
WHO HAVE DIFFERENT CONCERNS IN

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:06.268
MINE AND AND SLOWED YOU KNOW IN

01:15:06.335 --> 01:15:07.102
COULD POTENTIALLY SLOW DOWN THE

01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:08.904
PROCESS THAT WE HAVE TO FIND A

01:15:08.971 --> 01:15:11.406
WAY? TO BUILD HOUSING AND ALSO

01:15:11.473 --> 01:15:13.876
PROTECT THE COMMUNITY -- AGAIN I

01:15:13.942 --> 01:15:14.776
WOULD BE HAPPY HAVE

01:15:14.843 --> 01:15:16.044
CONVERSATIONS IT SOUNDS LIKE

01:15:16.111 --> 01:15:18.480
BOTH OPPOSITION -- AND

01:15:18.547 --> 01:15:19.948
SUPPORTERS TALKED ABOUT THE

01:15:20.015 --> 01:15:21.550
CENTRAL COAST IT'S HARD

01:15:21.617 --> 01:15:23.986
SOMETIMES -- MAY AND IT'S HARD

01:15:24.052 --> 01:15:25.153
FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS BECAUSE

01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:26.521
THE ONE A ONE MIGHT NOT BE THERE

01:15:26.588 --> 01:15:31.126
IN FIFTY YEARS IF WE DO SEE SEA

01:15:31.193 --> 01:15:32.494
LEVEL RISE ENTRANCE -- TATIAN

01:15:32.561 --> 01:15:33.128
WILL BE AN ISSUE -- BECAUSE WE

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:33.962
ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO NATURAL

01:15:34.029 --> 01:15:35.397
DISASTERS -- SINCE WE HAVE A FEW

01:15:35.464 --> 01:15:36.798
NO NATIONAL FOREST SURROUNDING

01:15:36.865 --> 01:15:38.834
US -- IT IN SO I WANT THOSE TO

01:15:38.901 --> 01:15:41.003
BE CONSIDERED -- I KNOW THAT THE

01:15:41.069 --> 01:15:43.438
AUTHOR IS SOMEONE WHO CARES A

01:15:43.505 --> 01:15:45.841
LOT ABOUT THE SAME THINGS AND

01:15:45.908 --> 01:15:47.542
AND THAT HAS BEEN EVIDENT IN OUR

01:15:47.609 --> 01:15:49.578
CONVERSATIONS ARE THAT WE'VE HAD

01:15:49.645 --> 01:15:51.013
WE'VE HAD MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONS

01:15:51.079 --> 01:15:54.316
ABOUT THIS BILL -- AND CERTAINLY --

01:15:54.383 --> 01:15:56.251
I A THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

01:15:56.318 --> 01:15:58.153
TO IDENTIFY -- AND ESTABLISH

01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:01.456
THAT THIS COULD BE ONE TOOL --

01:16:01.523 --> 01:16:02.090
EIGHT YOU KNOW IT SHOULD MOVE

01:16:02.157 --> 01:16:04.092
FORWARD THROUGH THE ENTIRE

01:16:04.159 --> 01:16:06.328
PROCESS -- BUT THIS WON'T BE THE

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:08.730
BE ALL AND SOLVE ALL -- I WILL

01:16:08.797 --> 01:16:10.165
BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY I

01:16:10.232 --> 01:16:12.668
WILL BE EVALUATING AS THE BILL

01:16:12.734 --> 01:16:13.702
MOVES FORWARD WHERE I'M AT I

01:16:13.769 --> 01:16:15.971
THINK CONVERSATION NEEDS TO

01:16:16.038 --> 01:16:18.240
CONTINUE -- BUT I DO HOPE THAT

01:16:18.307 --> 01:16:21.743
WE INCLUDE SOME OF THE MORE YOU

01:16:21.810 --> 01:16:22.344
KNOW THE EASIER QUESTIONS ARE

01:16:22.411 --> 01:16:24.413
THE THE THE FIRST THAT WE ARE

01:16:24.479 --> 01:16:28.450
THE ONES THAT ARE ANSWERED BUT

01:16:28.517 --> 01:16:29.918
THERE SOME HARDER WHEN -- AS

01:16:29.985 --> 01:16:31.286
WELL [inaudible]

01:16:31.353 --> 01:16:34.022
MR STONE.

01:16:34.089 --> 01:16:35.924
THANK YOU AND THANK YOU A

01:16:35.991 --> 01:16:36.458
SERVICE FOR BRINGING THIS

01:16:36.525 --> 01:16:36.725
FORWARD.

01:16:36.792 --> 01:16:37.392
YOU AND I ALSO HAD CONVERSATIONS

01:16:37.459 --> 01:16:38.760
AROUND THIS AND I ABSOLUTELY

01:16:38.827 --> 01:16:40.662
SUPPORT AND LOG YOUR GOALS TO

01:16:40.729 --> 01:16:42.197
GET MORE FORMER HOUSING WE KNOW

01:16:42.264 --> 01:16:45.100
THAT THAT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL.

01:16:45.167 --> 01:16:46.802
AND AS BOTH OF US BE REPRESENT

01:16:46.868 --> 01:16:49.571
AS OF THE NORTHERN END OF THE

01:16:49.638 --> 01:16:52.207
CENTRAL COAST.

01:16:52.274 --> 01:16:54.543
JUST LOOKING FOR THE KNOWLEDGE

01:16:54.609 --> 01:16:57.846
BUT THAT'S THIS IS SOMETHING

01:16:57.913 --> 01:16:58.480
THAT'S VERY CRITICAL BUT I WILL

01:16:58.547 --> 01:16:58.680
ALSO.

01:16:58.747 --> 01:16:59.781
SO MY CONCERNS THOUGH ARE THIS

01:16:59.848 --> 01:17:01.316
NOTION OF STREAMLINING WE WE

01:17:01.383 --> 01:17:03.785
HAVE ARE STARTING TO CREATE THIS

01:17:03.852 --> 01:17:06.154
NOTION THAT SEQUEL IS THE THE

01:17:06.221 --> 01:17:07.522
ANSWER GETTING RID OF SEEK OR

01:17:07.589 --> 01:17:09.391
DOING SOME BASIC WAS THE ANSWER

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:10.492
TO OUR PROBLEMS.

01:17:10.559 --> 01:17:11.727
STATISTICALLY THAT'S JUST NOT

01:17:11.793 --> 01:17:13.128
THE CASE IT'S BECOME AN

01:17:13.195 --> 01:17:14.262
UNNECESSARY WHIPPING.

01:17:14.329 --> 01:17:18.033
BOY TO THE PROCESS HERE AND IF

01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:20.435
THAT'S OUR FOCUS I THINK WE

01:17:20.502 --> 01:17:22.604
FORGET THE OTHER THINGS WE NEED

01:17:22.671 --> 01:17:23.438
TO BE DOING.

01:17:23.505 --> 01:17:25.741
BY CREATING PROJECTS LIKE THIS

01:17:25.807 --> 01:17:28.410
AS MINISTERIAL PERMITS WE WHAT

01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:29.244
IS REALLY BEING DONE IS WE'RE

01:17:29.311 --> 01:17:31.013
TAKING THE PUBLIC PROCESS IS

01:17:31.079 --> 01:17:32.414
SICK OR PRESENTS.

01:17:32.481 --> 01:17:34.116
OUT OF THE CONVERSATION.

01:17:34.182 --> 01:17:35.217
AND THERE.

01:17:35.283 --> 01:17:37.386
WAS A RECENT VERY SUCCESSFUL

01:17:37.452 --> 01:17:38.954
PROJECT THAT YOU KNOW WOULD IN

01:17:39.021 --> 01:17:40.389
SPRECKELS THAT.

01:17:40.455 --> 01:17:42.024
WENT THROUGH THAT FULL PROCESS

01:17:42.090 --> 01:17:43.892
NOW THAT IS ONE THAT IS BEING

01:17:43.959 --> 01:17:45.994
RUN BY THE GROWER THAT'S NOT A

01:17:46.061 --> 01:17:47.796
PART OF YOUR BILL THAT I HAVE

01:17:47.863 --> 01:17:49.998
ANY PROBLEM WITH YOUR I WILL I

01:17:50.065 --> 01:17:50.799
WILL DEFINITELY SUPPORTER THAT.

01:17:50.866 --> 01:17:52.267
BUT IT WENT THROUGH THE ENTIRE

01:17:52.334 --> 01:17:54.403
PROCESS AND THE GROWER THERE THE

01:17:54.469 --> 01:17:57.205
DEVELOPER WAS VERY SMART AND HOW.

01:17:57.272 --> 01:18:00.008
THEY ENGAGED THE THE FOLKS WHO

01:18:00.075 --> 01:18:01.576
TYPICALLY PUSHED BACK AND WANT

01:18:01.643 --> 01:18:02.677
TO PROTECT SEQUIN ARE VERY

01:18:02.744 --> 01:18:04.012
WORRIED ABOUT DEVELOPMENT.

01:18:04.079 --> 01:18:05.147
THAT ACTUALLY GOT ENTITLED

01:18:05.213 --> 01:18:07.082
FAIRLY QUICKLY AND WITHOUT A LOT

01:18:07.149 --> 01:18:08.750
OF GRIEF AND PAIN BECAUSE THEY

01:18:08.817 --> 01:18:10.886
DID THE WORK UP FRONT WHICH IS

01:18:10.952 --> 01:18:12.387
WHAT I HAVE FOUND IN MY

01:18:12.454 --> 01:18:14.156
EXPERIENCE AS A LOCAL ELECTED.

01:18:14.222 --> 01:18:15.023
IS WHAT LEADS TO SEE WHAT

01:18:15.090 --> 01:18:16.792
PROBLEMS IS AN UNWILLINGNESS TO

01:18:16.858 --> 01:18:18.927
DO THE WORK UP FRONT TO TALK TO

01:18:18.994 --> 01:18:21.863
STAKEHOLDERS AND TO TO BUILD.

01:18:21.930 --> 01:18:23.398
THAT THE CASE FOR DEVELOPMENT SO

01:18:23.465 --> 01:18:25.400
THE PART THAT WORRIES ME IS THIS

01:18:25.467 --> 01:18:27.135
CREATION OF A MINISTERIAL

01:18:27.202 --> 01:18:33.208
PROCESS FOR THAT WHICH THIS YEAR

01:18:33.275 --> 01:18:33.708
IF THIS GOES THROUGH.

01:18:33.775 --> 01:18:35.544
OF TAKING THE PUBLIC OF OUT OF A

01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:36.411
LOT OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND I

01:18:36.478 --> 01:18:37.112
THINK.

01:18:37.179 --> 01:18:39.314
THAT IS NOT A GOOD THING THAT

01:18:39.381 --> 01:18:42.150
ALMOST SOME PLACES GUARANTEES

01:18:42.217 --> 01:18:44.453
FURTHER STRIFE DOWN THE LINE AND

01:18:44.519 --> 01:18:46.655
MORE LAWSUITS AROUND IT BECAUSE

01:18:46.721 --> 01:18:47.189
THE DEVELOPERS ARE NOT AS

01:18:47.255 --> 01:18:49.458
INCLINED. TO ENGAGE WHO WOULD

01:18:49.524 --> 01:18:50.692
OTHERWISE BE IN BE OPPONENTS TO

01:18:50.759 --> 01:18:52.594
A PROJECT OR OR WHO WOULD BE

01:18:52.661 --> 01:18:53.695
WORRIED ABOUT THAT.

01:18:53.762 --> 01:18:55.330
SO I I WOULD JUST ASK I'M I'M A

01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:57.299
GUEST HERE TODAY AND I RECOGNIZE

01:18:57.365 --> 01:18:59.167
THAT I'M GONNA DEFINITELY FOLLOW

01:18:59.234 --> 01:18:59.835
THE CHAIR ON INDIAN.

01:18:59.901 --> 01:19:01.069
BUT I APPRECIATE THE

01:19:01.136 --> 01:19:02.737
CONVERSATIONS WE HAD HAD ASKED

01:19:02.804 --> 01:19:03.772
TO BE VERY CAREFUL.

01:19:03.839 --> 01:19:05.207
ABOUT THAT MOVING FORWARD AND

01:19:05.273 --> 01:19:06.842
NOT CREATING A PROCESS THAT

01:19:06.908 --> 01:19:09.744
EXCLUDES LEGITIMATE PUBLIC

01:19:09.811 --> 01:19:11.012
INVOLVEMENT IN A LOT OF THE

01:19:11.079 --> 01:19:13.348
DECISIONS THAT GET MADE.

01:19:13.415 --> 01:19:15.784
ABOUT WHERE HOUSING GOES WHAT IT

01:19:15.851 --> 01:19:17.953
LOOKS LIKE AND IT'S THAT SEQUEL

01:19:18.019 --> 01:19:20.155
PROCESS THAT ENFORCES.

01:19:20.222 --> 01:19:22.257
THE WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO

01:19:22.324 --> 01:19:23.158
ACCOMPLISH THEM BECAUSE THOSE

01:19:23.225 --> 01:19:24.793
PRIDE THAT PROJECT AND THERE'S

01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:25.360
ANOTHER ONE THAT'S PROPOSING

01:19:25.427 --> 01:19:26.428
CASTRO ABOUT.

01:19:26.495 --> 01:19:28.130
SOME OF THE COMMUNITY CONCERNS

01:19:28.196 --> 01:19:30.632
THERE ARE WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE IF

01:19:30.699 --> 01:19:31.700
THEY'RE GONNA BE SOARED WILL

01:19:31.766 --> 01:19:32.934
BERWICK STYLE IF YOU THEY'RE

01:19:33.001 --> 01:19:34.469
JUST HOUSING PEOPLE HOUSE PEOPLE

01:19:34.536 --> 01:19:35.904
THOSE ISSUES OF ALL COME UP.

01:19:35.971 --> 01:19:37.239
AND THE DEVELOPER REALLY HAD TO

01:19:37.305 --> 01:19:38.406
ADDRESS THOSE.

01:19:38.473 --> 01:19:40.475
BANKRATE ENVIRONMENT RECOGNIZING

01:19:40.542 --> 01:19:42.511
THAT IT'S THE THE NATURE OF

01:19:42.577 --> 01:19:43.578
FARMWORKERS WHO THEY ARE WHAT

01:19:43.645 --> 01:19:45.714
THEY ARE THAT THEY ARE FAMILIES

01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:47.282
THAT THEY HAVE BROADER NEEDS.

01:19:47.349 --> 01:19:49.784
THAN HAD BEEN SEEN IN THE PAST

01:19:49.851 --> 01:19:53.188
BECAME A VERY GOOD PART OF THE

01:19:53.255 --> 01:19:54.289
CONVERSATION SO I JUST DON'T

01:19:54.356 --> 01:19:56.958
WANT TO LOSE THOSE ASPECTS OF IT

01:19:57.025 --> 01:19:59.227
IN A RUSH TO GET HOUSING DONE.

01:19:59.294 --> 01:20:00.929
WHICH WE SHOULD BE DOING AND I

01:20:00.996 --> 01:20:02.731
KNOW YOU AGREE WITH THAT AND I

01:20:02.797 --> 01:20:03.598
CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THAT.

01:20:03.665 --> 01:20:04.933
BUT THERE ARE SOME PROCESSES WE

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.868
NEED TO BE CAREFUL OF THAT WE'RE

01:20:06.935 --> 01:20:08.403
NOT OVERSTEPPING AND ESPECIALLY

01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:10.338
WHEN IT HASN'T ALWAYS PROVEN TO

01:20:10.405 --> 01:20:11.139
BE.

01:20:11.206 --> 01:20:12.774
A STUMBLING BLOCK I THINK WE

01:20:12.841 --> 01:20:14.142
PRESUME A STUMBLING BLOCK WHERE

01:20:14.209 --> 01:20:15.944
THERE ISN'T NECESSARILY ONE AND

01:20:16.011 --> 01:20:19.548
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO GET OVER

01:20:19.614 --> 01:20:20.115
SOME OF THE CHALLENGE TO GET

01:20:20.182 --> 01:20:22.017
BROUGHT UP BUT THANK YOU.

01:20:22.083 --> 01:20:22.817
SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE

01:20:22.884 --> 01:20:25.353
COMMENTS AND AND CLEARLY I AND

01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:27.355
COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT

01:20:27.422 --> 01:20:28.290
THE YOU KNOW.

01:20:28.356 --> 01:20:29.558
MYSELF MY STAFF THAT WOULD

01:20:29.624 --> 01:20:30.492
CONTINUE THE WORK WITH THE

01:20:30.559 --> 01:20:31.893
ENVIRONMENTAL -- THE COMMUNITY

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:33.228
WITH AND AND AND CERTAINLY WITH

01:20:33.295 --> 01:20:34.596
WITH -- YOU KNOW ALL OF YOU AND

01:20:34.663 --> 01:20:36.631
AND MY COLLEAGUES TO MAKE SURE.

01:20:36.698 --> 01:20:38.033
THAT WE CONTINUE STRAIGHT AND

01:20:38.099 --> 01:20:39.067
THIS BILL FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL

01:20:39.134 --> 01:20:41.036
PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW I THAT'S

01:20:41.102 --> 01:20:41.670
SOMETHING I'M REALLY OPEN TO A

01:20:41.736 --> 01:20:42.237
BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE

01:20:42.304 --> 01:20:45.140
COMMENTS -- AND YOU KNOW I I I I

01:20:45.207 --> 01:20:47.642
SHOULD MENTION THAT.

01:20:47.709 --> 01:20:48.843
IN THE SALINAS VALLEY I COMMAND --

01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:51.146
WE'RE VERY CLOSELY WITH WITH

01:20:51.213 --> 01:20:51.746
WITH AGRICULTURE THERE ON THIS

01:20:51.813 --> 01:20:52.214
