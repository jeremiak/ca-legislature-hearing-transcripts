AND- SUMMER SONG- IT DID. HAVE

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:47.138
SOME A QUESTION ABOUT THE BILL

00:36:47.204 --> 00:36:50.274
HAD. PARTIALLY BASED ON THE

00:36:50.341 --> 00:36:51.642
PRESENTATION AND SOME OF THE

00:36:51.709 --> 00:36:52.944
COMMENTS BY THE SUPPORTERS AND

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:55.246
ANALYSIS THAT- IT AT THE MINUTE

00:36:55.313 --> 00:36:56.581
DOES RAISE SOME CONCERN SO I

00:36:56.647 --> 00:36:58.182
SAY FUNDAMENTALLY I BELIEVE THE

00:36:58.249 --> 00:36:59.717
PURPOSE OF YOUR BILL IS TO

00:36:59.784 --> 00:37:00.885
ESSENTIALLY ALLOW PHARMACISTS

00:37:00.952 --> 00:37:03.354
TO ALSO ADMINISTER. VACCINES

00:37:03.421 --> 00:37:04.822
HAVE BEEN APPROVED THAT ARE NOT

00:37:04.889 --> 00:37:05.856
NECESSARY PART OF ROUTINE

00:37:05.923 --> 00:37:07.491
SCHEDULE SO I KNOW WHERE THE

00:37:07.558 --> 00:37:08.793
VACCINES AS MENTIONED FOR

00:37:08.859 --> 00:37:10.428
EXAMPLE LIKE YELLOW FEVER

00:37:10.494 --> 00:37:12.229
VACCINE OR OTHER TYPES OF

00:37:12.296 --> 00:37:14.799
VACCINES- THAT BEEN APPROVED BY

00:37:14.865 --> 00:37:16.567
THE FDA BUT I WOULD MAKE NOTE

00:37:16.634 --> 00:37:19.103
THAT- EACH ONE OF THOSE

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:22.373
VACCINES ACTUALLY HAS- THE ACIP

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:23.708
GIVING RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO

00:37:23.774 --> 00:37:25.142
WHO APPROPRIATELY GETS THE

00:37:25.209 --> 00:37:27.712
VACCINE AND IN WHAT

00:37:27.778 --> 00:37:29.647
CIRCUMSTANCES SELL- I GUESS MY

00:37:29.714 --> 00:37:31.616
CONCERN IS THAT WHAT I'VE HEARD

00:37:31.682 --> 00:37:33.050
IN YOUR PRESENTATION AND EVEN

00:37:33.117 --> 00:37:34.885
IN SOME OF THE COMMENTS AND BY

00:37:34.952 --> 00:37:36.220
THE SUPPORTERS HERE IN ANALYSIS

00:37:36.287 --> 00:37:39.423
IS THAT. THE DESIRE TO GIVE

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:41.192
VACCINES THAT HAVE BEEN FDA

00:37:41.258 --> 00:37:42.727
APPROVED BUT THE AC I. T. IS

00:37:42.793 --> 00:37:45.096
NOT PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS

00:37:45.162 --> 00:37:47.798
REGARDING THEIR- WHO SHOULD GET

00:37:47.865 --> 00:37:48.499
THEM AND UNDER WHAT

00:37:48.566 --> 00:37:50.201
CIRCUMSTANCES AND I WOULD MAKE

00:37:50.267 --> 00:37:52.770
NOTE OF THAT- EVEN FOR COVET

00:37:52.837 --> 00:37:54.305
THE COVETED ACT SCENES THAT-

00:37:54.372 --> 00:37:56.040
WE'VE JUST DONE EVEN IN THE

00:37:56.107 --> 00:37:59.243
PRESS OF OUR- CURRENT PANDEMIC-

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:01.879
EVEN AFTER FIFTY- EARTH EARLY

00:38:01.946 --> 00:38:03.948
USE AUTHORIZATION. THEY WERE

00:38:04.015 --> 00:38:05.516
NOT BEGUN TO BE ADMINISTERED

00:38:05.583 --> 00:38:06.984
AND TELL THE A. C. I. T. IT'S

00:38:07.051 --> 00:38:08.686
DONE ITS REVIEW AS TO WHO

00:38:08.753 --> 00:38:09.820
SHOULD GET THE VACCINE UNDER

00:38:09.887 --> 00:38:12.289
WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES. AND THAT'S

00:38:12.356 --> 00:38:14.558
THE WAY. WE DO THINGS TO BE

00:38:14.625 --> 00:38:15.960
SURE THAT THE PRO PEOPLE GET

00:38:16.027 --> 00:38:18.129
THE VACCINES. AT THE PROPERTY

00:38:18.195 --> 00:38:19.630
AND APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES

00:38:19.697 --> 00:38:21.132
IT SAID IT'S NOT JUST THE FDA

00:38:21.198 --> 00:38:23.968
APPROVAL ALONE IT IS THE FDA.

00:38:24.035 --> 00:38:25.603
FOLLOWED BY THE A. C. I. T. THE

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:27.204
EVENTS ARE COMEDIANS ASIAN

00:38:27.271 --> 00:38:29.040
PRACTICE WHICH PART OF THE CDC.

00:38:29.106 --> 00:38:30.541
SO I AM A LITTLE CONCERNED

00:38:30.608 --> 00:38:32.076
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEIR

00:38:32.143 --> 00:38:39.116
STATEMENTS LIKE- THE FDA. C. I.

00:38:39.183 --> 00:38:40.217
T. TAKES TOO LONG SO. THE MEANS

00:38:40.284 --> 00:38:42.653
THAT OUR- CAN BE A- OUTSIDE OF

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.055
ACTIVE MINISTER VACCINES THEY

00:38:44.121 --> 00:38:45.189
HAVEN'T HAD A SAFETY

00:38:45.256 --> 00:38:47.324
RECOMMENDATIONS. BECAUSE QUOTE

00:38:47.391 --> 00:38:50.161
THEY TAKE TOO LONG EXCEPT- THEN

00:38:50.227 --> 00:38:51.562
WHO ARE THEY GIVING THEM TWO

00:38:51.629 --> 00:38:53.297
AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:38:53.364 --> 00:38:55.232
SO I THINK THIS NEEDS

00:38:55.299 --> 00:38:57.401
CLARIFICATION- BECAUSE

00:38:57.468 --> 00:38:58.769
OTHERWISE I THINK WORK FOR YOU

00:38:58.836 --> 00:38:59.904
KNOW AND I GUESS THE THING THAT

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:02.206
SCARES ME IS THAT- THE PEOPLE

00:39:02.273 --> 00:39:03.541
WHO WOULD BE ADMINISTERING

00:39:03.607 --> 00:39:04.809
THESE VACCINES AND DO NOT SEEM

00:39:04.875 --> 00:39:06.143
TO BE VERY AWARE OF THE ROLE

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:08.279
THE A. C. I. T. AND SO THAT

00:39:08.345 --> 00:39:09.980
THAT'S- THAT'S- THAT'S A BIT.

00:39:10.047 --> 00:39:11.549
THAT CONCERNING AND I WOULD

00:39:11.615 --> 00:39:12.950
ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT- I KNOW MY

00:39:13.017 --> 00:39:14.518
OFFICE IT REACHED OUT TO YOUR

00:39:14.585 --> 00:39:15.720
OFFICE AND THEY MADE REFERENCE

00:39:15.786 --> 00:39:17.088
TO THE- LEGEND YOU KNOW THE

00:39:17.154 --> 00:39:18.622
PASSAGE OF AB SEVENTEEN TEN

00:39:18.689 --> 00:39:20.124
LAST SESSION REGARDING KOBE BUT

00:39:20.191 --> 00:39:21.492
I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT. YOU

00:39:21.559 --> 00:39:22.293
KNOW WHEN I WENT BACK AND TOOK

00:39:22.359 --> 00:39:23.594
A LOOK AT THE BILL. VERY

00:39:23.661 --> 00:39:25.563
CLEARLY SAID THAT EVEN FOR

00:39:25.629 --> 00:39:26.831
COVERT VACCINE IT WOULD BE

00:39:26.897 --> 00:39:29.967
BASED ON- A C. I. T. THAT WAS

00:39:30.034 --> 00:39:31.736
ACTUALLY STATED STRICTLY THAT.

00:39:31.802 --> 00:39:33.137
SPECIFICALLY IN THAT PARTICULAR

00:39:33.204 --> 00:39:34.672
LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED I

00:39:34.739 --> 00:39:35.973
WAS PROUD OF THAT FOR THAT

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:39.043
PIECE OF LEGISLATION SO. I SO I

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:40.845
THINK I'M FINE WITH WHAT YOU'RE

00:39:40.911 --> 00:39:42.446
TRYING TO ACHIEVE BUT I AM VERY

00:39:42.513 --> 00:39:44.982
CONCERNED ABOUT- THAT THE

00:39:45.049 --> 00:39:46.851
STATEMENTS AROUND EIGHT C. I.

00:39:46.917 --> 00:39:48.886
P. I KNOW YOU DID SAY IT TOWARD

00:39:48.953 --> 00:39:50.688
THE END OF YOUR PRESENTATION.

00:39:50.755 --> 00:39:51.689
THAT YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO GET

00:39:51.756 --> 00:39:53.357
AROUND A C. I. T. BUT I THINK

00:39:53.424 --> 00:39:54.225
IT NEEDS TO BE MUCH MORE

00:39:54.291 --> 00:39:56.327
EXPLICITLY STATED BECAUSE- AND

00:39:56.393 --> 00:39:58.162
IN THE BILL BECAUSE I BECAUSE

00:39:58.229 --> 00:40:00.131
IT SAID I'M I'M HEARING ALSO IN

00:40:00.197 --> 00:40:02.600
PRESENT. AND SUPPORT LETTERS

00:40:02.666 --> 00:40:04.368
THAT THEY THEY TALK ABOUT.

00:40:04.435 --> 00:40:05.603
TRYING TO DO THIS BEFORE THE

00:40:05.669 --> 00:40:07.204
ACA P. EVEN GIVES

00:40:07.271 --> 00:40:09.173
RECOMMENDATIONS AND THAT TO ME

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.509
WOULD BE VERY CONCERNING. SO

00:40:11.575 --> 00:40:14.111
PERHAPS- YOU CAN CLARIFY. THAT

00:40:14.178 --> 00:40:17.681
THE INTENTS. OF FILE. WHAT DO

00:40:17.748 --> 00:40:20.050
YOU WISH TO HAPPEN- WITH WITH

00:40:20.117 --> 00:40:22.520
THAT IT. IS A RESULT OF THIS

00:40:22.586 --> 00:40:24.822
BILL I MEAN THIS IS THIS ARE WE

00:40:24.889 --> 00:40:26.490
GONNA HAVE IS THIS I MEAN. ARE

00:40:26.557 --> 00:40:27.758
WE HAVE PHARMACISTS GIVING

00:40:27.825 --> 00:40:30.227
VACCINES THAT HAVE JUST

00:40:30.294 --> 00:40:32.129
RECEIVED FDA APPROVAL PRIOR TO

00:40:32.196 --> 00:40:34.098
A C. I. T. RECOMMENDATIONS AS

00:40:34.165 --> 00:40:41.338
TO THE- WHO'S APPROPRIATELY. HE

00:40:41.405 --> 00:40:41.839

00:40:41.906 --> 00:40:43.140
VACCINES AND WHAT IT'S A-

00:40:43.207 --> 00:40:45.075
REMEMBER SO I APPRECIATE THE-

00:40:45.142 --> 00:40:45.843
BUT THE QUESTION IS THE CONCERN

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:47.178
AND CERTAINLY- I WILL DEFER TO

00:40:47.244 --> 00:40:49.079

00:40:55.452 --> 00:40:56.654
SIMPLY SAYS THAT WE WANT TO

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:58.522
EXPAND- THE RULES COMMITTEE

00:40:58.589 --> 00:41:01.292
PHARMACIES ACAP- AS GOOD AS IT

00:41:01.358 --> 00:41:02.827
DOES MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON

00:41:02.893 --> 00:41:04.862
VACCINES AND PHARMACISTS WILL

00:41:04.929 --> 00:41:06.130
FOLLOW THE C. I. P.

00:41:06.197 --> 00:41:08.232
RECOMMENDATION- IT'S PART OF

00:41:08.299 --> 00:41:10.201
THE TRAINING AS MENTIONED BY-

00:41:10.267 --> 00:41:12.136
BUT MY WITNESS THAT IS THE BEST

00:41:12.203 --> 00:41:13.504
PRACTICE THE PHARMACIST BUT IN

00:41:13.571 --> 00:41:14.405
THE CONFUSION THAT EXISTS RIGHT

00:41:14.471 --> 00:41:16.207
NOW IS THAT. THERE IS ALSO AN

00:41:16.273 --> 00:41:18.442
ACAP ROUTINE LISTED SCHEDULE IS

00:41:18.509 --> 00:41:20.110
DIFFERENT THAN THE ACIP

00:41:20.177 --> 00:41:21.345
RECOMMENDATION ON BACKS OF

00:41:21.412 --> 00:41:23.447
ATTACKS NATIONS THE ROUTINE

00:41:23.514 --> 00:41:24.915
SCHEDULE IS WHAT PHARMACISTS

00:41:24.982 --> 00:41:26.217
ARE CURRENTLY ONLY ALLOWED TO

00:41:26.283 --> 00:41:27.785
MINISTER IN THE ROUTINE

00:41:27.852 --> 00:41:29.286
SCHEDULE CERTAIN VACCINES

00:41:29.353 --> 00:41:31.055
RECORDED DEFINED AS ROUTINE

00:41:31.121 --> 00:41:33.090
HOWEVER OTHERS MAY INTERPRET

00:41:33.157 --> 00:41:35.526
THAT NON ROUTINE OVER INTERPRET

00:41:35.593 --> 00:41:36.694
THOSE VACCINATIONS THAT ARE

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.495
DEEMED NON LATINO DESTRUCTION

00:41:38.562 --> 00:41:39.463
UNDER THE STRICTEST

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:41.131
INTERPRETATION PHARMACISTS ARE

00:41:41.198 --> 00:41:43.767
NOT ALLOWED TO MINISTER THOSE-

00:41:43.834 --> 00:41:46.537
VACCINATIONS SO I THINK THAT

00:41:46.604 --> 00:41:48.239
THE LANGUAGE CONFUSION IS THAT

00:41:48.305 --> 00:41:49.573
WE FOLLOW THE ACIP

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.342
RECOMMENDATION WHAT THIS BILL

00:41:51.408 --> 00:41:52.843
IS DOING IS TO ALLOW

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:55.379
PHARMACISTS TO PROVIDE. THOSE

00:41:55.446 --> 00:41:56.814
VACCINES THE ON THE ROUTINE

00:41:56.881 --> 00:41:58.883
THIS THAT MAY NOT BE DEEMED NON

00:41:58.949 --> 00:42:01.151
ROUTINE OKAY SO I GUESS WHAT I

00:42:01.218 --> 00:42:06.757
WOULD ASK IS THAT. DO YOU

00:42:06.824 --> 00:42:07.358
COMMIT THAT AND TO. OBVIOUSLY

00:42:07.424 --> 00:42:08.726
WE'RE RIGHT TO BEFORE THIS BILL

00:42:08.792 --> 00:42:10.461
SHOWS UP ON THE- TO CLARIFY

00:42:10.527 --> 00:42:13.831
THAT THE PHARMACISTS- IF

00:42:13.898 --> 00:42:16.033
THEY'RE GIVING VACCINES. WILL

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:19.003
BE DOING YET- THE A. C. I. T.

00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:22.606
RECOMMENDATIONS SO AND THAT AND

00:42:22.673 --> 00:42:24.008
NOT JUST BECAUSE BECAUSE RIGHT

00:42:24.074 --> 00:42:25.609
NOW JUST AS FDA APPROVAL SO

00:42:25.676 --> 00:42:27.611
THERE'S A- GAP AND YOU KNOW

00:42:27.678 --> 00:42:29.246
THERE COULD BE VERY SHORT AS I

00:42:29.313 --> 00:42:30.314
SAID WITH THAT COVETED

00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:32.016
LITERALLY WAS IN WITHIN A WEEK

00:42:32.082 --> 00:42:33.417
WHERE THE A. C. I. T. DID THE

00:42:33.484 --> 00:42:33.918
REVIEW AND PROVIDE

00:42:33.984 --> 00:42:35.686
RECOMMENDATIONS BUT- I'LL TELL

00:42:35.753 --> 00:42:37.154
YOU AS A PHYSICIAN I'D DO WE

00:42:37.221 --> 00:42:38.389
DON'T GIVE VACCINES UNTIL THE

00:42:38.455 --> 00:42:40.157
A. C. I. T. IS SPOKEN TO. WE DO

00:42:40.224 --> 00:42:41.725
WE DON'T JUST WAIT FOR THE FDA

00:42:41.792 --> 00:42:43.827
AND GIVE ITSELF I THINK IT'S

00:42:43.894 --> 00:42:44.428
IMPORTANT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT

00:42:44.495 --> 00:42:46.430
CLARIFICATION- AND IN FACT I

00:42:46.497 --> 00:42:47.598
WOULD NOTE THAT THE PRIOR

00:42:47.665 --> 00:42:49.400
LEGISLATION YEAH THAT WAS FOR

00:42:49.466 --> 00:42:50.734
TWO ALSO HAD THAT KIND OF

00:42:50.801 --> 00:42:53.637
LANGUAGE IN THERE. SO I THINK

00:42:53.704 --> 00:42:55.506
SO IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO

00:42:55.572 --> 00:42:57.007
GET LIKE A YELLOW FEVER VACCINE

00:42:57.074 --> 00:42:58.609
FINE WITH THAT BUT THERE'S

00:42:58.676 --> 00:42:59.576
ACTUALLY A C. I. T.

00:42:59.643 --> 00:43:00.911
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WHO SHOULD

00:43:00.978 --> 00:43:03.414
GET IT AND SO FORTH SO. I THINK

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:05.215
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE BILL

00:43:05.282 --> 00:43:06.951
HAS THAT CLAIFICATION IN THERE

00:43:07.017 --> 00:43:10.254
BECAUSE- I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT

00:43:10.321 --> 00:43:11.655
TO TRAVEL I THINK JEMELE

00:43:11.722 --> 00:43:13.891
PHARMACISTS WILL DO THAT. I

00:43:13.958 --> 00:43:14.892
THINK THERE'S SOME CONFUSION

00:43:14.959 --> 00:43:15.960
ESPECIALLY GIVEN SOME OF THE

00:43:16.026 --> 00:43:17.928
STATEMENTS BEING MADE ABOUT THE

00:43:17.995 --> 00:43:19.730
BILL- THAT I SAW ON THE

00:43:19.797 --> 00:43:23.033
ANALYSIS AND FRANKLY EVEN YOUR

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:24.802
PRESENTATION YOU START OFF BY

00:43:24.868 --> 00:43:25.636
MAKING A COMMENT ABOUT THE C.

00:43:25.703 --> 00:43:28.672
I. T. THAT WAS THAT SOMETIMES

00:43:28.739 --> 00:43:29.974
THAT PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO WAIT

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:31.508
AND- THAT THAT THAT WOULD BE

00:43:31.575 --> 00:43:33.210
VERY CONCERNING NO I WENT AND

00:43:33.277 --> 00:43:34.545
CERTAINLY WOULD WOULD WOULD

00:43:34.611 --> 00:43:36.714
PLEDGE AND WORK WITH YOU AND TO

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:39.049
SWITCH THOSE CONCERNS- THE-

00:43:39.116 --> 00:43:41.318
WE'VE LEARNED. EARLY THAT

00:43:41.385 --> 00:43:43.454
THROUGH THE SPEND AND MAKE THAT

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:44.421
THE ROLE OF PHARMACISTS IS

00:43:44.488 --> 00:43:45.656
CRITICAL BOARD TO RELIEVE THE

00:43:45.723 --> 00:43:47.057
STRESS ON ON ON THE MEDICAL

00:43:47.124 --> 00:43:49.326
SYSTEM SO THE GOAL OF THIS IS

00:43:49.393 --> 00:43:51.362
SIMPLY TO EXPAND ACCESS TO

00:43:51.428 --> 00:43:52.796
COMMUNITY PHARMACIES ALLOW

00:43:52.863 --> 00:43:54.431

SERVICE TO BE PROVIDED BY THEM.

00:43:55.933 --> 00:43:58.902
BUT THERE IS NO DESIRE FOR IT

00:43:58.969 --> 00:44:01.005
EVER TO BYPASS THEY SAID P.

00:44:01.071 --> 00:44:02.740
RECOMMENDATION PROCESS IT IS

00:44:02.806 --> 00:44:04.041
SOON TO BE A MINISTER'S

00:44:04.108 --> 00:44:06.443

01:00:59.922 --> 01:01:02.558
LIMITED EXPANSION OF TESTING.

01:01:02.625 --> 01:01:04.560
AND I GUESS I WAS JUST CURIOUS-

01:01:04.627 --> 01:01:06.029
YOU KNOW I CAN SEE THE VALUE OF

01:01:06.095 --> 01:01:08.097
HAVING IN YOUR PHARMACY BEING

01:01:08.164 --> 01:01:08.931
ABLE TO GETALL THESE SORTS OF

01:01:08.998 --> 01:01:10.967

HEAD IS THAT. THE BEST BEFORE-

01:01:23.146 --> 01:01:23.980
NINE TAKES A MORE MEASURED

01:01:24.047 --> 01:01:25.548

TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY-

01:01:27.216 --> 01:01:28.985
WHAT WOULD BE YOUR ARGUMENT FOR

01:01:29.052 --> 01:01:31.054

01:02:05.388 --> 01:02:06.456
IN BOTH OF THE BILLS IS

01:02:06.522 --> 01:02:08.558

AND I'M JUST TO ANSWER THE

01:02:25.708 --> 01:02:30.880
CONCERN FROM SENATOR LEYVA-

CONVERSATIONS I'VE AMENDED MY

02:31:16.700 --> 02:31:18.369

02:31:18.436 --> 02:31:19.470

OPEN RECORDS DATABASE. SO WHAT

02:31:32.716 --> 02:31:35.519
DOES THIS BILL DO. SIMPLY PUT A

02:31:35.586 --> 02:31:36.821
B. TWELVE SEVENTY EIGHT

02:31:36.887 --> 02:31:37.855
REQUIRES PHYSICIANS AND

02:31:37.922 --> 02:31:39.857
SURGEONS TO DO ONE THING AND

02:31:39.924 --> 02:31:41.792
ONE THING ALONE. TO NOTIFY

NOTICE THAT THE PATIENTMUST

02:31:55.406 --> 02:31:57.374
SIGN. HOPEFULLY THE SIGNATURE

02:31:57.441 --> 02:31:58.509
WILL GET MORE PEOPLE TO READ

02:31:58.576 --> 02:31:59.910
THE FORM. THIS CAN BE

02:31:59.977 --> 02:32:01.178
ACCOMPLISHED IN THE WAITING

02:32:01.245 --> 02:32:03.848
ROOM AND IS NOT REQUIRED TO BE

02:32:03.914 --> 02:32:04.381
DONE BY THE PHYSICIAN OR

02:32:04.448 --> 02:32:08.085
SURGEON DURING VISIT. TO POSTED

02:32:08.152 --> 02:32:10.054
IN A LOCATION IN AN AREA THAT

02:32:10.120 --> 02:32:12.423
IS LIKELY TO BE SEEN BY ALL

02:32:12.490 --> 02:32:15.659
PERSONS WHO ENTERED THE OFFICE.

DATABASE NOTICE ON THE INTERNET

02:32:19.497 --> 02:32:21.699
WEBSITE USED TO PUT THE

02:32:21.765 --> 02:32:22.199
PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS

02:32:22.266 --> 02:32:25.302
PRACTICE. WHY THREE DIFFERENT

02:32:25.369 --> 02:32:26.737
WAYS OF NOTIFICATION THE SAME

02:32:26.804 --> 02:32:29.940
REASON PEPSI AND COKE USE TV

02:32:30.007 --> 02:32:31.842
RADIO PRINT AND THE INTERNET

02:32:31.909 --> 02:32:34.712
SIMPLY BECAUSE- PEOPLE PROCESS

02:32:34.778 --> 02:32:37.281
INFORMATION DIFFERENTLY. SOME

02:32:37.348 --> 02:32:38.749
MAY SEE THE POST A NOTICE IN

02:32:38.816 --> 02:32:40.985

MAY SEE IT ONLINE OTHERS DON'T

02:32:43.587 --> 02:32:45.523
HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET.

02:32:45.589 --> 02:32:47.091
AND THERE'S ALSO DIFFERENCES IN

02:32:47.157 --> 02:32:49.059
DEMOGRAPHICS AND HOW EVERY

02:32:49.126 --> 02:32:50.728
DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP APPROACHES

02:32:50.794 --> 02:32:53.531
INFORMATION. WHAT IS THE OPEN

02:32:53.597 --> 02:32:55.099
PAYMENTS DATABASE AND WHY ALL

02:32:55.165 --> 02:32:58.235
THE FUSS. THE DATABASE IS AN

02:32:58.302 --> 02:33:00.404
EASY TO USE FEDERAL WEBSITE

02:33:00.471 --> 02:33:02.039
WHICH LISTS FINANCIAL EXCHANGES

02:33:02.106 --> 02:33:03.440
BETWEEN DRUG AND DEVICE

02:33:03.507 --> 02:33:05.509
MANUFACTURERS AND HEALTH CARE

02:33:05.576 --> 02:33:09.079
PROVIDERS GOING BACK TO TWO

02:33:09.146 --> 02:33:09.880
THOUSAND FOURTEEN. ALL YOU HAVE

02:33:09.947 --> 02:33:11.181
TO DO IS TYPE IN YOUR DOCTOR'S

02:33:11.248 --> 02:33:13.784

02:33:13.851 --> 02:33:15.519
RECEIVED COMPENSATION FOR

02:33:15.586 --> 02:33:17.421
RESEARCH INDUSTRY SPONSORED

02:33:17.488 --> 02:33:21.091
EDUCATION. OR FREE LUNCH. THE

02:33:21.158 --> 02:33:23.861
PROBLEM I'M TRYING TO SOLVE IS

02:33:23.928 --> 02:33:26.063
THAT NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT IT. THE

02:33:26.130 --> 02:33:28.999
SOLUTION IS TO NOTIFY PATIENTS

02:33:29.066 --> 02:33:31.969
OF THE DATABASE AND WE NEED TO

02:33:32.036 --> 02:33:32.503
DO THAT REPETITIVELY SO IT

02:33:32.570 --> 02:33:35.105
STICKS. WHILE ACCEPTING THESE

02:33:35.172 --> 02:33:36.907
PAYMENTS DO NOT NECESSARILY

02:33:36.974 --> 02:33:38.375
TRANSLATE INTO A CONFLICT OF

02:33:38.442 --> 02:33:40.210
INTEREST THE DATABASE PROVIDES

02:33:40.277 --> 02:33:42.179
THE PATIENT WITH INFORMATION

02:33:42.246 --> 02:33:43.914
THAT MAY HELP THEM MAKE BETTER

02:33:43.981 --> 02:33:45.049
INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR

02:33:45.115 --> 02:33:48.118
HEALTH CARE. IN THE CASE OF MY

02:33:48.185 --> 02:33:50.120
CONSTITUENT WINDY CONNECT WHO

02:33:50.187 --> 02:33:52.856
UNDERWENT BREAST RECONSTRUCTION

02:33:52.923 --> 02:33:54.658
IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN

02:33:54.725 --> 02:33:56.460
FOLLOWING A DOUBLE MASTECTOMY

02:33:56.527 --> 02:33:58.228
SHE OPTED FOR SURGERIES AFTER

02:33:58.295 --> 02:34:01.332
TESTING REVEALED THAT SHE- HAD

02:34:01.398 --> 02:34:03.834
THE BRCA GENE WHICH MADE HER

02:34:03.901 --> 02:34:06.170
SUSCEPTIBLE TO BREAST CANCER.

02:34:06.236 --> 02:34:07.471
NOW MY CONSTITUENT IS LIVING

02:34:07.538 --> 02:34:08.973

02:34:09.039 --> 02:34:11.342
EXPERIENCING SEVERE

02:34:11.408 --> 02:34:11.909
COMPLICATIONS FOLLOWING HER

02:34:11.976 --> 02:34:14.478
SURGERY. SHE LEARNED THAT HER

02:34:14.545 --> 02:34:15.946
PHYSICIAN HAD RECEIVED MORE

02:34:16.013 --> 02:34:18.882

MANUFACTURER OF THE DEVICE USED

02:34:23.253 --> 02:34:25.055
IN HER SURGERY. THIS

02:34:25.122 --> 02:34:26.357
INFORMATION WAS AVAILABLE ON

02:34:26.423 --> 02:34:28.459
THE FEDERAL DATABASE BUT SHE

02:34:28.525 --> 02:34:30.828
DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT ITS EXISTENCE.

02:34:30.894 --> 02:34:32.363
SHE LEARNED SHE ALSO LEARNED

02:34:32.429 --> 02:34:33.497
THAT THE DEVICE ITSELF WAS

02:34:33.564 --> 02:34:34.965
EXPERIMENTAL FOR BREAST

02:34:35.032 --> 02:34:37.167
RECONSTRUCTION AND HAD NOT BEEN

02:34:37.234 --> 02:34:39.503
APPROVED BY THE FDA. BY THE WAY

02:34:39.570 --> 02:34:41.538
COLLEAGUES. MY CONSTITUENTS

02:34:41.605 --> 02:34:44.174
HUSBAND IS A DOCTOR HE WAS NOT

02:34:44.241 --> 02:34:47.144
AWARE OF THIS WEBSITE. AND

02:34:47.211 --> 02:34:49.079
WINDY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SHE MAY

02:34:49.146 --> 02:34:51.048
HAVE ASKED MORE QUESTIONS AND

02:34:51.115 --> 02:34:53.150
MOST LIKELY WOULD HAVE REACHED

02:34:53.217 --> 02:34:55.452
OUT. FOR A SECOND OPINION.

02:34:55.519 --> 02:34:57.054
FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN

02:34:57.121 --> 02:34:58.956
PHYSICIANS AND MEDICAL PRODUCT

02:34:59.023 --> 02:35:00.924
MANUFACTURERS ARE COMMON. AND

02:35:00.991 --> 02:35:02.893
THEY'RE CERTAINLY NOT ALL BAD

02:35:02.960 --> 02:35:04.628
HOWEVER THEYCAN ALSO CREATE

02:35:04.695 --> 02:35:06.163
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND IN

02:35:06.230 --> 02:35:08.232
SOME CASES CAN BE LEARNED A LOT

02:35:08.298 --> 02:35:09.700
BLUR THE LINES BETWEEN

02:35:09.767 --> 02:35:11.135
PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES AND THE

02:35:11.201 --> 02:35:12.670
CONDUCT OF MEDICAL RESEARCH

02:35:12.736 --> 02:35:15.806
TRAINING AND PRACTICE. A TWO

02:35:15.873 --> 02:35:16.407
THOUSAND NINETEEN ANALYSIS BY

02:35:16.473 --> 02:35:18.208
PROPUBLICA FOUND THAT ON

02:35:18.275 --> 02:35:19.643
AVERAGE DOCTORS WHO RECEIVED

02:35:19.710 --> 02:35:22.279
PAYMENTS PRESCRIBED 50% MORE OF

02:35:22.346 --> 02:35:24.081
THAT DRUG THE DOCTORS WHO DID

02:35:24.148 --> 02:35:26.250
NOT NOW I CAN ALSO DEBATE THAT

02:35:26.316 --> 02:35:28.952
POINT AND I CAN TELL YOU. THAT

02:35:29.019 --> 02:35:31.055
MAYBE FOR MOST DOCTORS THAT

02:35:31.121 --> 02:35:32.990
PRODUCT IS THE BEST PRODUCT ON

02:35:33.057 --> 02:35:35.693
THE MARKET. AND THAT IT HAPPENS

02:35:35.759 --> 02:35:38.128
TO COINCIDE ALSO WITH A GREATER

02:35:38.195 --> 02:35:39.930
AMOUNT OF MARKETING BUT NOT THE

02:35:39.997 --> 02:35:42.466
OTHER WAY AROUND SO I CAN SEE

02:35:42.533 --> 02:35:45.502
THAT AS WELL. A SEPARATE STUDY

02:35:45.569 --> 02:35:46.737
CONCLUDED THAT THE RECEIPT OF

02:35:46.804 --> 02:35:48.005
INDUSTRY SPONSORED MEALS WAS

02:35:48.072 --> 02:35:49.406
ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED

02:35:49.473 --> 02:35:50.641
RATE OF PRESCRIBING THE

THE DRUG CLASS. RECENT

02:35:56.647 --> 02:35:58.682
OPPOSITION STATES THERE IS NO

02:35:58.749 --> 02:36:00.617

DISCLOSURE IN PLACE HOWEVER.

02:36:12.529 --> 02:36:13.931
WHAT THEY FAIL TO MENTION IS

02:36:13.997 --> 02:36:16.433
THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT

02:36:16.500 --> 02:36:19.403

NOTIFICATION I KNOW YOU TALKED

02:47:53.463 --> 02:47:55.064
ABOUT THREE DIFFERENT PATHS-

02:47:55.131 --> 02:47:56.933
FOR- INFORMING PEOPLE ABOUT THE

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:58.401
EXISTENCE OF THE DATABASE I DO

02:47:58.468 --> 02:47:59.769
HAVE TO SAY I WAS AWARE OF THE

02:47:59.836 --> 02:48:01.771
EXISTENCE OF THE DATABASE- IN

02:48:01.838 --> 02:48:04.841
MY PRACTICE BUT- I GUESS THE

02:48:04.908 --> 02:48:06.543

IS- SERVED IN. RECORDKEEPING

02:48:13.049 --> 02:48:17.987
BURDEN SO FOR THE PRACTICE SO-

02:48:18.054 --> 02:48:19.756
SO THE ISSUE WOULD BE IS THAT

02:48:19.823 --> 02:48:21.891
IT WHAT KIND OF DOCUMENTATION

02:48:21.958 --> 02:48:23.493
DOES THE PRACTICE ITSELF WOULD

02:48:23.560 --> 02:48:25.395
HAVE TO MAINTAIN TO SHOW THAT

02:48:25.462 --> 02:48:26.896
IT DID THESE THINGS SO YOUNG WE

02:48:26.963 --> 02:48:28.798
HAVE A FIXED THING ON THE WALL

02:48:28.865 --> 02:48:29.833

INITIALLY AND ANNUALLY. BUT IS

02:48:37.440 --> 02:48:38.975
THE PRACTICE GOING TO HAVE TO

02:48:39.042 --> 02:48:40.343
THEN BE REQUIRED TO SIMPLY KEEP

02:48:40.410 --> 02:48:42.178

02:48:48.618 --> 02:48:50.320
BOARD OF SOMEONE ELSE COMES BY

02:48:50.386 --> 02:48:51.254
TO SHOW THAT THEY ACTUALLY GAVE

02:48:51.321 --> 02:48:53.756
IT IN THE LAST YEAR. OR WOULD

02:48:53.823 --> 02:48:57.393

02:49:12.976 --> 02:49:13.776
WHAT WE NORMALLY DO IN OUR

02:49:13.843 --> 02:49:15.411

02:50:38.661 --> 02:50:41.264

02:50:48.338 --> 02:50:49.238
THAT IT DOESN'T CREATED

02:50:49.305 --> 02:50:51.040
MINISTER OF BURDENS I'M VERY

02:50:51.107 --> 02:50:53.543
SENSITIVE ESPECIALLY TO MEDICAL

02:50:53.610 --> 02:50:56.245
CLINICS AND OFFICES IN RURAL

02:50:56.312 --> 02:50:58.548
AREAS THAT MAY NOT HAVE. THE

02:50:58.615 --> 02:51:00.149
PHYSICIANS NECESSARY TO ADDRESS

02:51:00.216 --> 02:51:01.551
THE NEEDS LET ALONE ALSO THE

02:51:01.618 --> 02:51:03.152
ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANTS THAT

02:51:03.219 --> 02:51:04.053
WILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL OF

02:51:04.120 --> 02:51:06.356
THIS I DID PUT SOME THOUGHT

02:51:06.422 --> 02:51:08.224
INTO THIS ALONG WITH WITH THE

02:51:08.291 --> 02:51:09.659
SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL TO MAKE

02:51:09.726 --> 02:51:12.695
SURE WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE IT

02:51:12.762 --> 02:51:16.132
EASY- IF YOU KNOW. I THINK AS

02:51:16.199 --> 02:51:21.270
THESE THE BILL OFFERS A BY THE

02:51:21.337 --> 02:51:22.805
WAY THERE'S ALSO JUST YOU YOU

02:51:22.872 --> 02:51:24.841
DID MENTION ANNUAL SO I WANT TO

02:51:24.907 --> 02:51:26.509
ADDRESS THAT AND THE

02:51:26.576 --> 02:51:28.578
REPRESENTATIVE FOR CMA SAID

02:51:28.645 --> 02:51:31.114
THAT I FAILED TO LET THIS BODY

02:51:31.180 --> 02:51:32.849
NO I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER FAIL

02:51:32.915 --> 02:51:34.817
TO LET ANYONE KNOW ANYTHING SO

02:51:34.884 --> 02:51:39.656
I WANT TO CORRECT THAT WORDING-

02:51:39.722 --> 02:51:42.592
THIS BILL. ASKS FOUR EIGHT

02:51:42.659 --> 02:51:46.496
ANNUAL- UPDATING OF THE

02:51:46.562 --> 02:51:48.598
INFORMATION BECAUSE DOCTOR PEN

02:51:48.665 --> 02:51:51.501
THE GOAL IS REPETITION IF WE

02:51:51.567 --> 02:51:52.969
KEEP ON REPEATING SOMETHING

02:51:53.036 --> 02:51:54.537
SEVERAL TIMES A STUDY SUGGESTS

02:51:54.604 --> 02:51:55.972
YOU REPEAT SOMETHING SEVEN

02:51:56.039 --> 02:51:57.140
TIMES IT'LL STICK WITH SOMEONE

02:51:57.206 --> 02:51:59.075
RIGHT THE IDEA IS TO REPEAT

02:51:59.142 --> 02:52:01.077
THIS SO THAT PEOPLE SEE IT AND

02:52:01.144 --> 02:52:01.878
WHEN YOU LOOK AT A YOUNGER

02:52:01.944 --> 02:52:03.646
DEMOGRAPHIC THAT DOESN'T GO TO

02:52:03.713 --> 02:52:05.114
THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE BUT FOR

02:52:05.181 --> 02:52:06.816
MAYBE ONCE EVERY FIVE YEARS TEN

02:52:06.883 --> 02:52:08.851
YEARS. THEY'RE NOT THE DOCTOR'S

02:52:08.918 --> 02:52:10.753
OFFICE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO THEN

02:52:10.820 --> 02:52:12.555
GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO MAIL THE

02:52:12.622 --> 02:52:14.590
DOCUMENT TO THAT PERSON'S HOME

02:52:14.657 --> 02:52:15.625
REQUIRING THEM TO SEND IT BACK

02:52:15.692 --> 02:52:17.360
TO THEM THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT

02:52:17.427 --> 02:52:19.429
THIS JUST SAYS THE NEXT TIME

02:52:19.495 --> 02:52:20.296
YOU HAPPEN TO GO TO THE

02:52:20.363 --> 02:52:22.365
DOCTOR'S OFFICE YOU CAN FILL

02:52:22.432 --> 02:52:24.200
OUT THAT SIGNED THIS DOCUMENT

02:52:24.267 --> 02:52:27.036
WE MADE IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE

02:52:27.103 --> 02:52:28.838
SO THAT THE DOCTORS OFFICES NOT

02:52:28.905 --> 02:52:32.275
BURDENED SO IT'S I JUST WANT TO

02:52:32.341 --> 02:52:32.809
CORRECT THAT. AND YOU WILL

02:52:32.875 --> 02:52:37.113
COMMENT. LET ME JUST SAY THAT.

02:52:37.180 --> 02:52:39.282
I APPRECIATE THAT WHAT I'M

02:52:39.348 --> 02:52:40.616
CONCERNED IS THAT THE WET

02:52:40.683 --> 02:52:42.185
LEASED THE WAY IT'S PHRASED

02:52:42.251 --> 02:52:44.520
RIGHT NOW. TERMS OF ENFORCEMENT

02:52:44.587 --> 02:52:46.989
RIGHT. SO YOU KNOW I I'M

02:52:47.056 --> 02:52:48.191
ACTUALLY IN SOME WAYS I'M FINE

02:52:48.257 --> 02:52:50.026
YOU KNOW WHAT. GO AHEAD GIVE IT

02:52:50.093 --> 02:52:52.428
OUT. THE QUESTION IS THAT. THE

02:52:52.495 --> 02:52:54.630
WAY IT'S PHRASED RIGHT NOW

02:52:54.697 --> 02:52:57.300
THAT- WHEN SOMEONE SAYS OH DID

02:52:57.366 --> 02:52:59.135
YOU COMPLY WITH THE LAW. SHOW

02:52:59.202 --> 02:53:02.105
ME EVIDENCE THAT YOU HAVE.

02:53:02.171 --> 02:53:04.540
EVERY PATIENT WHO ISSEEN ASA

02:53:04.607 --> 02:53:06.442
SIGN DOCUMENTS IN YOUR FILES

02:53:06.509 --> 02:53:07.477
AND I WOULD POINT OUT

02:53:07.543 --> 02:53:09.645
PARTICULARLY RULE PRACTICES-

02:53:09.712 --> 02:53:10.947
EITHER THE GUY DOING PAPER

02:53:11.013 --> 02:53:12.215
WHICH TASTED HAVE TO KEEP THE

02:53:12.281 --> 02:53:14.684
CAR YOU KNOW SOME. IN A FILING

02:53:14.751 --> 02:53:15.351
CABINET AND THEN JUST THAT JUST

02:53:15.418 --> 02:53:17.987
BUILDS UP- AND DISABILITY DOES

02:53:18.054 --> 02:53:20.556
LOTS OF PAPER OR- ANY OTHER EHR

02:53:20.623 --> 02:53:21.691
SYSTEM BUT THEN THE PROBLEM IS

02:53:21.758 --> 02:53:23.659
IT'S NOT. A PROGRAM TO DO THIS

02:53:23.726 --> 02:53:25.194
SO NOW THEY THEN GO BACK TO

02:53:25.261 --> 02:53:26.562
PAPER ORDERED TO HIRE SOMEONE

02:53:26.629 --> 02:53:28.765
TO REPROGRAM THE EHR WHICH IS

02:53:28.831 --> 02:53:30.600
BY THE WAY EXPENSIVE TO SELL

02:53:30.666 --> 02:53:31.768
THE BEST TIME TO BUY IT OFF THE

02:53:31.834 --> 02:53:34.137
SHELF. SO I THINK. AS I SAID

02:53:34.203 --> 02:53:36.272
IT'S- I'M NOT DISAGREEING WITH

02:53:36.339 --> 02:53:37.874
YOU IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL

02:53:37.940 --> 02:53:39.408
PROCESS OF NOTIFICATION I JUST

02:53:39.475 --> 02:53:41.477
WANT TO CLARIFY IN TERMS OF THE

02:53:41.544 --> 02:53:43.012
OBLIGATION TO PRACTICE. FOR

02:53:43.079 --> 02:53:45.481
FORSMAN PURPOSES RIGHT SO JUST

02:53:45.548 --> 02:53:46.282
TO FEEL THAT THEY COMPLIED WITH

02:53:46.349 --> 02:53:48.985
THE LAW. THAT WE NOT COMPEL THE

02:53:49.051 --> 02:53:50.686
PRACTICE TO ACTUALLY HAVE TO

02:53:50.753 --> 02:53:53.322
KEEP A COPY. AT A RECORD THAT

02:53:53.389 --> 02:53:55.391
THEY GAVE THIS DOCUMENT FOR

02:53:55.458 --> 02:53:56.959
EACH INDIVIDUAL PATIENT AND THE

02:53:57.026 --> 02:53:58.027
DATE THEY GAVE IT YOU KNOW

02:53:58.094 --> 02:54:00.029
WHAT. THAT SHOW THAT YOU THAT.

02:54:00.096 --> 02:54:01.497
USE THAT IN YOUR NORMAL

02:54:01.564 --> 02:54:02.665
PRACTICES YOU HAVE IT ON THE

WALL IT'S ON YOUR WEBSITE AND

02:54:04.433 --> 02:54:07.703
THAT. YOU KNOW THE YOUR CLERK

02:54:07.770 --> 02:54:08.738

02:54:08.805 --> 02:54:10.339

PATIENTS AS THEY COME IN. AND

02:54:13.776 --> 02:54:16.078
THAT BE SUFFICIENT TO SAY THAT

02:54:16.145 --> 02:54:16.813
YOU COMPLY WITH THIS

02:54:16.879 --> 02:54:18.948
PARTICULAR. BILL WHICH IF IT

02:54:19.015 --> 02:54:20.716
BECOMES A LAW THE LAW OF THE

02:54:20.783 --> 02:54:22.185
SIMPLIFIED TO BASICALLY

02:54:22.251 --> 02:54:24.754

BE UNFORTUNATE OF THIS LITTLE.

02:54:37.099 --> 02:54:38.067
FUTURE LAW ON THE PRESS AFTER

02:54:38.134 --> 02:54:39.268
SO UNTRUE TO. BE SURE WE KNOW

02:54:39.335 --> 02:54:40.036
ADDED THIS BURDEN.

02:54:40.102 --> 02:54:40.736
ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS ON THE

02:54:40.803 --> 02:54:42.338
PRESS FLOOR STILL ESSENTIALLY

02:54:42.405 --> 02:54:42.872
DOING THE SAME THING THAT

02:54:42.939 --> 02:54:45.842
YOU'RE SEEKING. AND IF I COULD

02:54:45.908 --> 02:54:47.009

ALL I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU.

02:54:50.279 --> 02:54:51.681
TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT WE

02:54:51.747 --> 02:54:53.382
CAN DO TO MAKE IT AS SIMPLE AS

02:54:53.449 --> 02:54:54.617
POSSIBLE YOU KNOW.

02:54:54.684 --> 02:54:56.452
UNFORTUNATELY WE DO LIVE IN A

02:54:56.519 --> 02:54:58.821
LITIGIOUS SOCIETY THAT REQUIRES

02:54:58.888 --> 02:55:02.158
US TO ALWAYS PROTECT OURSELVES.

02:55:02.225 --> 02:55:04.560
THIS WAS A FORM OF PROTECTION I

02:55:04.627 --> 02:55:05.995
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:55:06.062 --> 02:55:08.064
DOCTORS WERE PROTECTED AND- YOU

02:55:08.130 --> 02:55:10.466
KNOW WE WORKED WITH IN THE LAST

02:55:10.533 --> 02:55:11.500
SIX YEARS WE'VE WORKED ON TO

02:55:11.567 --> 02:55:13.536
VACCINATION RELATED BILLS.

02:55:13.603 --> 02:55:16.072
WHICH CMA SPONSOR. AND THE

02:55:16.138 --> 02:55:18.207
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF PAPERWORK

02:55:18.274 --> 02:55:19.709
THAT'S ACTUALLY BEEN GENERATED

02:55:19.775 --> 02:55:21.110
ON SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND

02:55:21.177 --> 02:55:22.945
EVERYBODY ELSE INVOLVED IT'S

02:55:23.012 --> 02:55:24.881
QUITE SIGNIFICANT AND THE COST

02:55:24.947 --> 02:55:27.016
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT PAPERWORK

02:55:27.083 --> 02:55:28.784
IS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT WHEN

02:55:28.851 --> 02:55:30.019
SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE TO MAIL

02:55:30.086 --> 02:55:32.088
OUT TO PARENTS. A CERTAIN

02:55:32.154 --> 02:55:34.457
NUMBER OF ENORMOUS VOLUMES OF

02:55:34.523 --> 02:55:36.893
LETTERS REQUIRING. A RESPONSE

02:55:36.959 --> 02:55:39.528
BACK SO. WHATEVER YOU DO IN

02:55:39.595 --> 02:55:42.899
THIS ARENA I THINK IN ORDER TO

02:55:42.965 --> 02:55:45.368
PROTECT ONESELF THERE'S GONNA

02:55:45.434 --> 02:55:48.638
BE A NEED FOR DOCUMENTING WELL

02:55:48.704 --> 02:55:49.972
THAT'S JUST PART OF THE SOCIETY

02:55:50.039 --> 02:55:52.508
WE LIVE IN. SO I THINK THAT

02:55:52.575 --> 02:55:54.477
APPLIES TO ALL OF US AND I'M

02:55:54.543 --> 02:55:56.178

FIRM COMMITMENT THAT- SOME

02:56:03.486 --> 02:56:04.420
ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS WHICH

02:56:04.487 --> 02:56:05.888
COULD BE TAKEN TO ADDRESS THIS

02:56:05.955 --> 02:56:07.523
PARTICULAR ISSUE WHICH STILL

02:56:19.135 --> 02:56:20.336
SEVEN SEVEN ACTUALLY DIDN'T GO

02:56:20.403 --> 02:56:21.337
TO A PROTEST BECAUSE THERE WAS

02:56:21.404 --> 02:56:23.272
NO COST. AS SOMETHING SCHOOLS

02:56:23.339 --> 02:56:26.909

THE ADMINISTRATIVE. BURDENS ON

02:56:39.889 --> 02:56:41.157
THE PRACTICE WHICH OF COURSE

SOMETHING ABOUT THE INSURANCE

03:02:36.779 --> 03:02:38.814
DOCUMENTATION HAS CHANGED THE

ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. I THINK

03:03:09.712 --> 03:03:11.280
THAT MR BECKER THERE IS A

03:03:11.347 --> 03:03:12.948

COMMIT TO YOU TO SOMETHING-

03:03:30.065 --> 03:03:31.867
BECAUSE IT FORCES ME INTO A

03:03:31.934 --> 03:03:33.769
REVOKE HERBAL POSITION IF I DO

03:03:33.836 --> 03:03:35.571

HAPPY TO ACCOMMODATE THE ONLY

03:04:03.799 --> 03:04:05.100
THING IS THAT I THINK THERE

03:04:05.167 --> 03:04:06.068
NEEDS TO BE SOME LEVEL OF

03:04:06.135 --> 03:04:08.036
FREQUENCY. BECAUSE AS MUCH AS

BECKER ABOUT CENTER BECKER

03:04:12.040 --> 03:04:15.511
ABOUT THE FACT THAT- SOME SOME

PATIENTS HAVE MULTIPLE DOCTORS

03:04:17.713 --> 03:04:18.747
YOU'RE COMPLETELY ACCURATE

03:04:18.814 --> 03:04:20.382
ABOUT THAT. BUT IT'S ALSO A

03:04:20.449 --> 03:04:22.584
DEMOGRAPHIC ISSUE. I RIGHT NOW

03:04:22.651 --> 03:04:23.852
ONLY NEED MAYBE ONE OR TWO

03:04:23.919 --> 03:04:25.487
DOCTORS I KNOW IN ABOUT TEN

FOUR OR FIVE DIFFERENT DOCTORS

03:04:29.625 --> 03:04:31.059
SO I DO UNDERSTAND THAT

03:04:31.126 --> 03:04:33.996
EXPOSURE ARGUMENT- I JUST FEEL

03:04:34.062 --> 03:04:35.364
LIKE IN ORDER TO CAPTURE SOME

03:04:35.431 --> 03:04:36.665
OF THE DEMOGRAPHICS THAT ARE

03:04:36.732 --> 03:04:38.767
SENSITIVE THAT MIGHT NOT BE. AS

03:04:38.834 --> 03:04:40.969

THAT WE TAKE THAT OUT BECAUSE

03:04:50.179 --> 03:04:53.148
IF I DO- THERE'S NO POINT OF

03:04:53.215 --> 03:04:54.483

03:06:36.018 --> 03:06:38.387

03:06:38.453 --> 03:06:41.557
A DIFFICULT TIME TRYING TO

THIS BILL IS NOT A SPONSORED

03:09:18.947 --> 03:09:22.718
BILL THIS BILL WAS THE AGONY OF

03:09:22.784 --> 03:09:26.521
A CONSTITUENT. WHO TOOK THE

03:09:26.588 --> 03:09:28.890

TRYING THIS IS MY SMALL WAY. OF

03:10:02.791 --> 03:10:05.627
REPAIRING THE WORLD- I THINK

03:10:05.694 --> 03:10:06.895
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE

03:10:06.962 --> 03:10:09.464
DONE ON THE MEDICAL BOARD. SO

03:10:09.531 --> 03:10:11.433
THAT PHYSICIANS WHO COMMIT

03:10:11.500 --> 03:10:13.769

ALLOWS EVERYONE TO KNOW FURTHER

03:10:35.857 --> 03:10:37.859
CREATES ACCOUNTABILITY AND IT'S

03:10:37.926 --> 03:10:40.328
A GOOD THING. WE DON'T HAVE

03:10:40.395 --> 03:10:41.696
CLOAKED PROBLEMS WITH OUR

03:10:41.763 --> 03:10:43.565

03:11:03.285 --> 03:11:06.655
