SOCIALIZATION ACOSTA MUST BE GO

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:54.832
BEYOND WHILE REPAIRS.

00:43:54.898 --> 00:43:56.700
EVERY MAJOR STAKEHOLDER MUST

00:43:56.767 --> 00:43:58.102
ALSO PLAY A PART IN THE SOLUTION

00:43:58.168 --> 00:43:59.103
UTILITIES INSURANCE AND THE

00:43:59.169 --> 00:44:01.171
STATE.

00:44:01.238 --> 00:44:02.172
OUR GOAL WITH THIS BILL IS TO

00:44:02.239 --> 00:44:03.407
WRITE A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION

00:44:03.474 --> 00:44:04.274
THAT ULTIMATELY PROVIDE

00:44:04.341 --> 00:44:06.443
STABILITY NOT ONLY DO UTILITIES

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:07.745
BUT REPAIRS AS WELL AS WILD FIRE

00:44:07.811 --> 00:44:08.912
VICTIMS.

00:44:08.979 --> 00:44:10.647
THIS IS OUR CALL TO ACTION AND

00:44:10.714 --> 00:44:11.448
THIS IS THE FIRST OF MANY

00:44:11.515 --> 00:44:12.950
CONVERSATIONS AND DEBATES THAT

00:44:13.017 --> 00:44:14.184
WE WON'T HAVE AMONGST OURSELVES

00:44:14.251 --> 00:44:15.486
AND STAKEHOLDERS.

00:44:15.552 --> 00:44:17.221
TOLD UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE WHILE

00:44:17.287 --> 00:44:18.956
WORKING TO MAKE VICTIMS HALL.

00:44:19.023 --> 00:44:20.424
AND TRYING NOT TO DO THIS ON THE

00:44:20.491 --> 00:44:21.458
SOUL AT THE SOLE EXPENSIVE

00:44:21.525 --> 00:44:22.960
REPAIRS.

00:44:23.027 --> 00:44:24.361
THIS IS A DIRECT AND TIMELY

00:44:24.428 --> 00:44:25.529
SOLUTION FOR THOSE IMPACTED BY

00:44:25.596 --> 00:44:27.464
WILDFIRES.

00:44:27.531 --> 00:44:29.266
FINALLY AB SEVEN FORTY ALSO ARE

00:44:29.333 --> 00:44:30.234
SO RIGHT AUTHORIZES THE

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:31.502
COMMISSION TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND

00:44:31.568 --> 00:44:33.337
THE USE OF THE FUND FOR OTHER

00:44:33.404 --> 00:44:33.837
CLIMATE CHANGE RELATED

00:44:33.904 --> 00:44:35.672
CATASTROPHES AS DEFINED BY THE

00:44:35.739 --> 00:44:36.874
GOVERNOR.

00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:38.375
WE WERE NOT PREPARED FOR THE

00:44:38.442 --> 00:44:39.943
PASSED CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES

00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:41.011
LET'S NOT MAKE THAT MISTAKE

00:44:41.078 --> 00:44:44.014
AGAIN WITH OTHER CLIMATE CHANGE

00:44:44.081 --> 00:44:45.249
CATASTROPHES.

00:44:45.315 --> 00:44:47.951
MEMBERS THE FACE OF THIS ISSUE

00:44:48.018 --> 00:44:48.886
SHOULD BE THOSE OF THE VICTIMS.

00:44:48.952 --> 00:44:51.021
THE GOAL FIRST AND FOREMOST OF

00:44:51.088 --> 00:44:53.057
ANY WHILE FINE WILDFIRE FUND

00:44:53.123 --> 00:44:54.591
SHOULD BE TO PROTECT ALL CURRENT

00:44:54.658 --> 00:44:56.427
AND FUTURE VICTIMS NOT THE

00:44:56.493 --> 00:44:57.694
UTILITIES.

00:44:57.761 --> 00:44:59.229
STABILIZING UTILITIES SHOULD BE

00:44:59.296 --> 00:45:00.531
THE BY PRODUCT OF WHAT EVER WE

00:45:00.597 --> 00:45:01.932
DO.

00:45:01.999 --> 00:45:03.233
I BELIEVE ONLY THEN CAN WE COME

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:04.601
UP WITH AN APPROPRIATE AND

00:45:04.668 --> 00:45:06.603
COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION ONE THAT

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:07.905
WE CAN ALL STAND BEHIND.

00:45:07.971 --> 00:45:09.606
WITH THAT I TURN IT OVER TO

00:45:09.673 --> 00:45:10.808
ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT.

00:45:10.874 --> 00:45:12.276
THANK YOU.

ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE FOR ASKING

00:45:17.481 --> 00:45:18.916
ME TO JOIN HER HERE TODAY AND WE

00:45:18.982 --> 00:45:20.551
LEARNED A LOT IN THE AFTERMATH

00:45:20.617 --> 00:45:21.985
OF THE TUBS FIRE WHICH WAS IN MY

00:45:22.052 --> 00:45:22.953
DISTRICT UP.

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:24.555
ALSO MENDOCINO COUNTY FIRES

00:45:24.621 --> 00:45:25.522
WE'VE HAD.

00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:26.957
SOME THE LESSONS IN RETROSPECT

00:45:27.024 --> 00:45:28.759
SEEM KIND OF OBVIOUS BUT FOR

00:45:28.826 --> 00:45:29.893
THOSE OF US WHO'VE NEVER LIVED

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:32.362
TO AN EVENT LIKE THE TUBS FIRE.

00:45:32.429 --> 00:45:32.896
THEY CAME AS A PRETTY RUDE

00:45:32.963 --> 00:45:34.031
AWAKENING. FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU

00:45:34.098 --> 00:45:35.532
LIVE IN A NEIGHBORHOOD IN YOUR

00:45:35.599 --> 00:45:37.734
HOME JUST YOUR HOME BURNS DOWN

00:45:37.801 --> 00:45:39.036
IT'S RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD

00:45:39.103 --> 00:45:40.137
TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH IT WILL

00:45:40.204 --> 00:45:41.839
COST TO REBUILD.

00:45:41.905 --> 00:45:42.706
DO YOU BUY INSURANCE FOR THAT

00:45:42.773 --> 00:45:43.974
AMOUNT AND YOU MAY BE BY A

00:45:44.041 --> 00:45:45.242
LITTLE BIT MORE IF THE INSURANCE

00:45:45.309 --> 00:45:46.410
COMPANIES WILL ALLOW YOU TO DO

00:45:46.477 --> 00:45:47.611
THAT AND THAT ISN'T ALWAYS THE

00:45:47.678 --> 00:45:48.879
CASE YOU CAN ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU

00:45:48.946 --> 00:45:50.581
REALLY NEED.

00:45:50.647 --> 00:45:53.016
PERFECT YOUR HOUSE AND FIVE

00:45:53.083 --> 00:45:53.917
THOUSAND OTHER HOUSES IN YOUR

00:45:53.984 --> 00:45:55.519
NEIGHBORHOOD BURNED DOWN ALL IN

00:45:55.586 --> 00:45:56.220
ONE NIGHT.

00:45:56.286 --> 00:45:58.122
THE COST OF YOU TO REBUILD YOUR

00:45:58.188 --> 00:45:58.989
HOME LOOKS SIGNIFICANTLY

00:45:59.056 --> 00:46:00.190
DIFFERENT.

00:46:00.257 --> 00:46:01.992
IN MARCH OF LAST YEAR SIX MONTHS

00:46:02.059 --> 00:46:03.594
AFTER THE TOP FIRE THE AVERAGE

00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:05.262
COST OF CONSTRUCTION LABOR

00:46:05.329 --> 00:46:07.698
MATERIALS INCREASED 30%.

00:46:07.764 --> 00:46:09.199
THIS IS ON TOP OF THE INCREASED

00:46:09.266 --> 00:46:11.001
COST TO DESIGN AND BUILD AND

00:46:11.068 --> 00:46:12.402
PLAN YOUR HOME.

00:46:12.469 --> 00:46:13.570
OVER THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF

00:46:13.637 --> 00:46:14.671
I'VE MET WITH CONSTITUENTS HAVE

00:46:14.738 --> 00:46:16.106
BEEN QUOTED MORE THAN A HUNDRED

00:46:16.173 --> 00:46:18.876
AND 522100% OF THE ESTIMATE IS

00:46:18.942 --> 00:46:19.843
PER SQUARE.

00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:22.212
FOOT COST TO REBUILD ABOVE WHAT

00:46:22.279 --> 00:46:23.881
WHAT WHAT THE NORMAL RATE WAS

00:46:23.947 --> 00:46:25.382
BEFORE THE FIRE.

00:46:25.449 --> 00:46:26.183
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO WOULD

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:28.185
MAINTAIN THE RECOMMENDED LEVELS

00:46:28.252 --> 00:46:29.920
OF INSURANCE BEFORE THE FIRE --

00:46:29.987 --> 00:46:31.188
BUT BECAUSE THE SUDDEN DEMAND

00:46:31.255 --> 00:46:33.423
FOR SUPPLIES AND LABOR MOST OF

00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:33.991
WHICH WERE IN SHORT SUPPLY

00:46:34.057 --> 00:46:36.426
ALREADY THE EFFECTIVELY BECAME

00:46:36.493 --> 00:46:39.029
UNDERINSURED MEANT MEN MANY WAYS

00:46:39.096 --> 00:46:40.664
GROSSLY UNDERINSURED OVERNIGHT.

00:46:40.731 --> 00:46:41.899
I REALIZE IT'S AN INCREDIBLY

00:46:41.965 --> 00:46:43.333
COMPLICATED ISSUE AND THERE'S A

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:44.701

WITH SO AND SO OVERWHELMING I

00:50:04.301 --> 00:50:05.469
KNOW -- ONE OF THE THINGS IT

00:50:05.535 --> 00:50:07.771
SHOWS IN ESTABLISHING THE

00:50:07.838 --> 00:50:10.407
COMMISSION -- I WOULD HOPE THAT

00:50:10.474 --> 00:50:11.508
WE COULD INCLUDE.

00:50:11.575 --> 00:50:12.075

00:50:12.142 --> 00:50:13.677
BOARD.

00:50:13.744 --> 00:50:15.812
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE DID --

00:50:15.879 --> 00:50:17.848
ALLOCATING TWO HUNDRED MILLION

00:50:17.914 --> 00:50:18.382

00:50:18.448 --> 00:50:19.816
EFFORT.

00:50:19.883 --> 00:50:21.918
WHICH IS FAR SHORT OF WHAT WE

00:50:23.286 --> 00:50:24.287
YOU KNOW A BILLION OVER FIVE

00:50:24.354 --> 00:50:25.856

00:50:25.922 --> 00:50:27.190
STAKEHOLDER IN THIS SO THAT THEY

00:50:27.257 --> 00:50:28.191

TASK FORCE AND THIS BILL WAS AN

01:27:44.726 --> 01:27:47.328
URGENT PRIORITY OF THE TASK

01:27:47.395 --> 01:27:49.464
FORCE -- IT'S A FOUNDATIONAL

01:27:49.530 --> 01:27:52.533
ISSUE IN TERMS OF THE INFANTS

01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:54.802
AND PERRANCE ABILITY. TO BOND

WITH ONE ANOTHER AND THAT'S

01:27:56.638 --> 01:27:57.872
SIMPLY TAKES TIME.

01:27:57.939 --> 01:27:59.407
AND WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT IS

01:27:59.474 --> 01:28:01.609
MAKING SURE THAT LOWER INCOME.

01:28:01.676 --> 01:28:02.810
WOMEN AND THEIR CHILDREN HAVE

01:28:02.877 --> 01:28:05.847
THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES TO BOND.

01:28:05.913 --> 01:28:08.182
AS UPPER INCOME CHILDREN.

01:28:08.249 --> 01:28:10.818
AND LET LET ME JUST INDICATE AT

01:28:10.885 --> 01:28:13.588
A COUPLE OF STATISTICS THAT SHOW

01:28:13.655 --> 01:28:17.725
ITS IMPORTANCE. FOR LOWER INCOME

01:28:17.792 --> 01:28:18.960
THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR.

01:28:19.027 --> 01:28:21.195
THE ABILITY TO UTILIZE FADE

01:28:21.262 --> 01:28:23.998
HAMLEY LEAVE THE UTILIZATION

01:28:24.065 --> 01:28:25.933
RATE IS 24%.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.568
UP 232%.

01:28:27.635 --> 01:28:29.737
IT'S THIRTY THIRTY TWO THOUSAND

01:28:29.804 --> 01:28:35.443
RATHER IT'S 3000030% UTILIZATION.

01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:36.778
SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.

01:28:36.844 --> 01:28:40.481
IT'S 41% UTILIZATION FOR THOSE

01:28:40.548 --> 01:28:42.850
EARNING OVER SIXTY TWO THOUSAND

01:28:42.917 --> 01:28:46.688
DOLLARS IT'S A 78% UTILIZATION.

01:28:46.754 --> 01:28:48.890
WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT LOWER

01:28:48.956 --> 01:28:51.325
INCOMEPEOPLE SIMPLY CANNOT TAKE

01:28:51.392 --> 01:28:52.894
THE REDUCTION IN INCOME WITH THE

01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:56.397
POVERTY LINE AT LEAST THIRTY TWO

01:28:56.464 --> 01:28:57.765
THOUSAND DOLLARS AND HIGHER?

01:28:57.832 --> 01:29:01.202
IN LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO

01:29:01.269 --> 01:29:02.870
IN THE OTHER.

01:29:02.937 --> 01:29:03.871
URBAN URBAN COUNTIES.

01:29:03.938 --> 01:29:06.941
OR WHAT THAT TRANSLATES INTO IF

01:29:07.008 --> 01:29:09.210
LOWER INCOME PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO

01:29:09.277 --> 01:29:11.779
TAKE PAID FAMILY LEAVE.

01:29:11.846 --> 01:29:14.449
AT THE SAME PERCENTAGE AS UPPER

01:29:14.515 --> 01:29:17.885
INCOME WOULD BE ANOTHER EIGHTY

01:29:17.952 --> 01:29:19.854
THREE THOUSAND FAMILIES A YEAR.

01:29:19.921 --> 01:29:21.289
WOULD BE ABLE TO UTILIZE IT.

01:29:21.355 --> 01:29:23.324
SO OVER FIVE OR SIX YEARS WERE

01:29:23.391 --> 01:29:24.525
TALKING ABOUT.

01:29:24.592 --> 01:29:27.128
A HALF A MILLION FAMILIES BEING

01:29:27.195 --> 01:29:29.430
ABLE TO UTILIZE PAID FAMILY

01:29:29.497 --> 01:29:31.132
LEAVE SO THIS IS SIMPLE.

01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:33.968
THIS IS SOLELY ABOUT LOWER

01:29:34.035 --> 01:29:36.871
INCOME PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO BOND

01:29:36.938 --> 01:29:38.573

MILLION NEURAL CONNECTIONS

01:30:00.461 --> 01:30:02.463
RESEARCH ALSO MAKES IT CLEAR

01:30:02.530 --> 01:30:04.398
THAT THOSE RELATIONSHIPS FEEL

01:30:04.465 --> 01:30:06.067

THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA.

01:32:14.729 --> 01:32:15.997
IT'S A SIMPLE SCENARIO.

01:32:16.063 --> 01:32:17.932
OF A MOM COMES INTO OUR CLINIC

01:32:17.999 --> 01:32:19.433

01:32:45.359 --> 01:32:46.727
THAT'S THE DECISION THAT'S IN

01:32:46.794 --> 01:32:48.429
FRONT OF US AS A STATE.

01:32:48.496 --> 01:32:50.331
AND IT'S REALLY A DECISION FOR

01:32:50.398 --> 01:32:51.799
US AS A STATE AS LEGISLATORS

01:32:51.866 --> 01:32:54.335

HOME IT STARTED SIX MONTHS AND I

EXTENDED BY TWO WEEKS.

01:35:45.039 --> 01:35:46.874
BUT THOSE DISPARITIES OF WHO CAN

ACTUALLY STAY HOME.

01:35:48.209 --> 01:35:50.945
DON'T GET FIXED FROM THAT SO

01:35:51.011 --> 01:35:52.279

01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:04.825

C. TO BE WAY THE UFCW MAINLY TO

01:42:19.132 --> 01:42:20.167
WE BELIEVE BETTER ALIGN OUR

01:42:20.234 --> 01:42:21.602
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM

01:42:21.668 --> 01:42:23.504
WITH ITS TWIN INTENDED PURPOSES

01:42:23.570 --> 01:42:25.072
OF BOTH HELPING WORKERS SURVIVE

01:42:25.138 --> 01:42:26.340
THE HARDSHIPS OF UNEMPLOYMENT

01:42:26.406 --> 01:42:27.808
BUT ALSO HELPING THEIR

01:42:27.875 --> 01:42:29.309
SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES AND

01:42:29.376 --> 01:42:30.644
LOCAL ECONOMIES DO THE SAME.

01:42:30.711 --> 01:42:31.778
THAT WHEN A GROUP OF WORKERS

01:42:31.845 --> 01:42:33.113
GOES OUT ON STRIKE AND THEY'RE

01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:34.381
LEFT WITH NOTHING.

01:42:34.448 --> 01:42:35.682
THEY CAN NO LONGER BUY GROCERIES

01:42:35.749 --> 01:42:36.517
THEY CAN NO LONGER PAY THEIR

01:42:36.583 --> 01:42:38.318
MORTGAGES AND THE NEGATIVE

01:42:38.385 --> 01:42:40.120
ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THAT CAN

01:42:40.187 --> 01:42:40.921
SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY

01:42:40.988 --> 01:42:42.256
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN

01:42:42.322 --> 01:42:43.924
REASONS THAT WE DO HAVE AN

01:42:43.991 --> 01:42:44.725
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM IS

01:42:44.791 --> 01:42:45.158
TO HELP.

01:42:45.225 --> 01:42:46.760
MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF THINGS

01:42:46.827 --> 01:42:47.628
LIKE THAT.

01:42:47.694 --> 01:42:49.763
AND JUST TO OUR QUICKLY RESPOND

01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:52.432
TO A FEW -- OPPONENT CONCERNS AS

01:42:52.499 --> 01:42:54.468
THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN STATED THERE

01:42:54.535 --> 01:42:55.502
ARE A LOT OF BUILT IN

01:42:55.569 --> 01:42:56.870
DISINCENTIVES THAT DISCOURAGE

01:42:56.937 --> 01:42:58.405
WORKERS FROM STRIKING.

01:42:58.472 --> 01:43:00.974
AND TO IMPLY THAT GIVING THEM

01:43:01.041 --> 01:43:02.075
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS

01:43:02.142 --> 01:43:03.710
ESPECIALLY AFTER A MONTH WE

01:43:03.777 --> 01:43:04.511
WOULD ARGUE PRETTY SEVERELY

01:43:04.578 --> 01:43:06.680
MISUNDERSTANDS WHAT GOING ON

01:43:06.747 --> 01:43:08.782
STRIKE IS ACTUALLY LIKE -- FOR

01:43:08.849 --> 01:43:09.650
ONE THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE

01:43:09.716 --> 01:43:11.418
SYSTEM ONLY REPLACES WAGES AT AN

01:43:11.485 --> 01:43:12.953
AVERAGE OF 26%.

01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:14.221
SO WHEN YOU GO OUT ON STRIKE

01:43:14.288 --> 01:43:15.556
YOU'RE COLLECTING ON AVERAGE

01:43:15.622 --> 01:43:16.924
ABOUT A QUARTER OF WHAT YOU WERE

01:43:16.990 --> 01:43:18.625
EARNING SO WHEN YOU COUPLE THAT

01:43:18.692 --> 01:43:20.794
WITH THE MONTH LONG WAIT -- THIS

01:43:20.861 --> 01:43:22.062
IS SOMETHING THAT MOST OF US

01:43:22.129 --> 01:43:23.864
WOULD REALLY STRUGGLE TO DO AND

01:43:23.931 --> 01:43:26.066
SO WE THINK THAT ALONE -- WILL

01:43:26.133 --> 01:43:27.668
ALWAYS MAKE SURE THAT WORKERS

01:43:27.734 --> 01:43:29.436
WILL ONLY STRIKE AS THEY DO NOW

01:43:29.503 --> 01:43:30.237
WHEN IT'S THE ABSOLUTE LAST

01:43:30.304 --> 01:43:31.171
RESORT.

01:43:31.238 --> 01:43:32.472
AND BEING ON STRIKE IS A

01:43:32.539 --> 01:43:34.441
GRUELING HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE

01:43:34.508 --> 01:43:36.109
IT'S NOT SITTING AT HOME WITH

01:43:36.176 --> 01:43:36.843
YOUR FEET ON THE COFFEE TABLE

01:43:36.910 --> 01:43:38.211
WITH SOME.

01:43:38.278 --> 01:43:38.845
YOU'RE OUT PICKETING YOU'RE OUT

01:43:38.912 --> 01:43:40.180
ORGANIZING USUALLY MUCH HARDER

01:43:40.247 --> 01:43:42.849
THAN YOUR ACTUAL JOB AND SO THAT.

01:43:42.916 --> 01:43:43.984
COMBINED WITH THE FACT THAT IT

01:43:44.051 --> 01:43:45.185
CREATES A LOT OF BAD BLOOD IN

01:43:45.252 --> 01:43:46.753
THE WORKPLACE IT'S NEVER REALLY

01:43:46.820 --> 01:43:48.455
THE SAME AFTER THAT THIS IS

01:43:48.522 --> 01:43:50.123
SOMETHING NO ONE WANTS TO DO.

01:43:50.190 --> 01:43:51.325
AND THAT'S WHY I WAS ALSO

01:43:51.391 --> 01:43:53.193
MENTION STRIKES ARE SO RARE. ONE

01:43:53.260 --> 01:43:54.795
FEDERAL AGENCY THAT TRACKS VERY

01:43:54.861 --> 01:43:56.663
LARGE STRIKES OF AFFECTING OVER

01:43:56.730 --> 01:43:57.965
A THOUSAND WORKERS FOUND THAT

01:43:58.031 --> 01:43:59.433
THERE WERE ONLY THREE IN THE

01:43:59.499 --> 01:44:00.801
LAST TEN YEARS.

01:44:00.867 --> 01:44:02.135
ANOTHER ONE THAT STRUCK THE

01:44:02.202 --> 01:44:03.270
TRACKS SMALLER STRIKES FOUND

01:44:03.337 --> 01:44:06.273
THAT FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN TO

01:44:06.340 --> 01:44:06.873
TWENTY SEVENTEEN DEPENDING ON

01:44:06.940 --> 01:44:10.611
HOW YOU COUNT THERE ARE ONLY

01:44:10.677 --> 01:44:11.244
SEVEN TO TEN STRIKES THAT WOULD

01:44:11.311 --> 01:44:12.546
BE A FACTORED BY THIS BILL.

01:44:12.613 --> 01:44:13.747
ONLY AFFECTING A TOTAL OF ONE

01:44:13.814 --> 01:44:14.381
THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY

01:44:14.448 --> 01:44:14.715
NINE WORKERS.

01:44:14.781 --> 01:44:15.515
TINY TINY FRACTION OF THE

01:44:15.582 --> 01:44:16.717
OVERALL UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE

01:44:16.783 --> 01:44:18.719
SYTEM SO WE THINK THE AFFECTS

01:44:18.785 --> 01:44:20.253
THAT WOULD BE PRETTY MINIMAL.

01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:21.588
AND JUST FINALLY -- THE

01:44:21.655 --> 01:44:22.823
OPPONENTS ALSO REFERENCE THE

01:44:22.889 --> 01:44:24.758
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA UFCW STRIKE

01:44:24.825 --> 01:44:26.493
THAT WE THINK IS A PERFECT

01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:28.061
EXAMPLE OF WHY THIS BILL IS SO

01:44:28.128 --> 01:44:29.563
IMPORTANT. FOR ONE THE VAST

01:44:29.630 --> 01:44:30.664
MAJORITY OF WORKERS AFFECTED

01:44:30.731 --> 01:44:31.865
WERE LOCKED OUT.

01:44:31.932 --> 01:44:33.100
SO WHETHER THEY WANTED TO WORK

01:44:33.166 --> 01:44:34.668
OR NOT THE EMPLOYER WASN'T GONNA

01:44:34.735 --> 01:44:36.570
LET THEM BUT BECAUSE OF SOME

01:44:36.637 --> 01:44:37.838
QUIRKS AND ARE YOU WHY SYSTEM

01:44:37.904 --> 01:44:38.639
THEY WEREN'T ALLOWED TO COLLECT

01:44:38.705 --> 01:44:40.040
BENEFITS.

01:44:40.107 --> 01:44:41.708
AND SO THE BILL FIXES THAT AND

01:44:41.775 --> 01:44:43.577
ALSO FOR THE WORKERS WHO DID GO

01:44:43.644 --> 01:44:44.945
OUT ON STRIKE THE EMPLOYER LONG

01:44:45.012 --> 01:44:46.647
STORY SHORT BASICALLY WANTED TO

01:44:46.713 --> 01:44:48.649
GET RID OF THEIR ENTIRE HEALTH

01:44:48.715 --> 01:44:50.017
PLAN AND THEIR PENSION PLAN.

01:44:50.083 --> 01:44:50.917
SO THESE ARE WORKERS WHO WERE

01:44:50.984 --> 01:44:52.052
REALLY BACKED INTO A CORNER

01:44:52.119 --> 01:44:53.453
WHERE THEY WERE FACED WITH THE

01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:54.755
LOSS OF HEALTH CARE AND THE LOSS

01:44:54.821 --> 01:44:56.189
OF RETIREMENT SECURITY.

01:44:56.256 --> 01:44:58.158
AND SO THEY ALSO WERE DENIED YOU

01:44:58.225 --> 01:45:00.427
AYE BENEFITS AND THAT'S WE THINK

01:45:00.494 --> 01:45:01.628
YOU KNOW REALLY THE KIND OF

01:45:01.695 --> 01:45:03.096
SITUATION WHERE WORKERS.

01:45:03.163 --> 01:45:05.065
HAVE NO OTHER OPTION THERE

01:45:05.132 --> 01:45:06.099
REALLY FORCED TO TAKE THIS NO

01:45:06.166 --> 01:45:07.668
MATTER WHAT THE NEGATIVE

01:45:07.734 --> 01:45:08.301
CONSEQUENCE OF GOING ON A STRIKE

01:45:08.368 --> 01:45:09.269
MIGHT BE.

01:45:09.336 --> 01:45:10.370
THOSE ARE EXACTLY THE KINDS

01:45:10.437 --> 01:45:11.204
WORKERS THAT WE THINK ARE OUT

01:45:11.271 --> 01:45:12.572
THERE THAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO

01:45:12.639 --> 01:45:14.074
BENEFIT FROM THIS BILL BUT

01:45:14.141 --> 01:45:14.941

01:49:44.811 --> 01:49:45.879
WE HAD TO PAY THAT BACK BECAUSE

01:49:45.946 --> 01:49:47.647
OF THE LOAN THAT WE TOOK OUT

01:49:47.714 --> 01:49:49.015
FROM THE FAT.

01:49:49.082 --> 01:49:50.583
THAT WAS OUR RESPONSIBILITY BUT

01:49:50.650 --> 01:49:52.786
WE ARE BUT OUR CONCERN ABOUT

01:49:52.852 --> 01:49:54.854
THIS BILL IS NOW A POPULATION OF

01:49:54.921 --> 01:49:56.923
INDIVIDUALS THAT IS OUTSIDE OF

01:49:56.990 --> 01:49:58.425
THE REACH CURRENTLY OF THE

01:50:07.968 --> 01:50:10.003
RESOURCES AND THE QUESTION THAT

01:50:10.070 --> 01:50:11.371
WE ASK THE COMMITTEE IS TO

01:50:11.438 --> 01:50:13.306
CONSIDER HOW THAT WILL IMPACT?

01:50:13.373 --> 01:50:14.975
THE THE SOLVENCY IN THE HEALTH

01:50:15.041 --> 01:50:16.776

BEING CLOSER AND CLOSER OR

01:50:22.649 --> 01:50:24.651
EXTENDED OVER FROM WHERE A

01:50:24.718 --> 01:50:26.820
RECESSION WOULD HEAD SO WE THINK

01:50:26.886 --> 01:50:28.221
THAT THOSE CONSIDERATIONS AS

01:50:28.288 --> 01:50:29.322
WELL AS THE ONES THAT WERE

01:50:29.389 --> 01:50:30.890

AND THE FULL NATURE OF THE FIND

01:50:36.663 --> 01:50:38.298
OUR REASONS -- FOR OUR

01:50:38.365 --> 01:50:40.467
OPPOSITION AND WE ASK FOR THE

01:50:40.533 --> 01:50:42.702
COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER THAT AND

01:50:42.769 --> 01:50:45.205

AGAINST THE BILL.

01:50:52.078 --> 01:50:53.346

OR COMMENTS THE CHAIR'S

01:51:02.789 --> 01:51:04.157
RECOMMENDATION IS A SUPPORT

01:51:04.224 --> 01:51:06.993
POSITION -- IT'S A VERY THOUGHT

01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:08.895
PROVOKING SUBJECT AND I THINK

01:51:08.962 --> 01:51:10.230
IT'S BEEN HASHED OUT PRETTY

01:51:10.296 --> 01:51:12.032
THOROUGHLY -- OUR OF OUR

01:51:12.098 --> 01:51:13.666
COMMITTEE STAFF DID A GREAT JOB

01:51:13.733 --> 01:51:15.969
ANALYZING IT AND THERE ARE SOME

01:51:16.036 --> 01:51:17.570
UNKNOWNS GOING FORWARD BUT WE

01:51:17.637 --> 01:51:19.773
WILL SEE WHAT THE EXPERIENCE

01:51:19.839 --> 01:51:23.476
ACTUALLY IS -- THE FUND IS HAD

01:51:23.543 --> 01:51:26.312
TO SOME TO SOME TOUGH TIMES AND

01:51:26.379 --> 01:51:29.082
IT'S SO IT'S SOLVENT NOW AND

01:51:29.149 --> 01:51:30.483
IT'S IN BETTER SHAPE THAN IT'S

01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:32.819
BEEN IN MANY YEARS THE RATES

01:51:32.886 --> 01:51:33.987
HAVE COME DOWN.

01:51:34.054 --> 01:51:36.589
OF IN SOME CASES SO WE'LL SEE

01:51:36.656 --> 01:51:38.224
WHAT THE EXPERIENCE IS.

01:51:38.291 --> 01:51:40.527
BUT I THINK -- THERE ARE MANY

01:51:40.593 --> 01:51:42.762
THINGS TO LIKE IN EMBRACE ABOUT

01:51:42.829 --> 01:51:44.964
THIS BILL IN AGAIN -- I'M

01:51:45.031 --> 01:51:46.766
RECOMMENDING SUPPORT POSITION IS

01:51:46.833 --> 01:51:49.135
OUR MOTION AND SECOND.

01:51:49.202 --> 01:51:50.503
THERE'S BEEN A MOTION AND SECOND

01:51:50.570 --> 01:51:51.905
MISS GONZALEZ FLETCHER ANY

01:51:51.971 --> 01:51:53.106
CLOSING COMMENTS THANK YOU I

01:51:53.173 --> 01:51:54.707
WOULD JUST SUGGEST -- IT'S

01:51:54.774 --> 01:51:56.042
INTERESTING BECAUSE HOW WE VIEW

01:51:56.109 --> 01:51:57.577
DE POLITICIZING SOMETHING I

01:51:57.644 --> 01:51:59.946
GUESS COMES FROM THE POINT OF OF

01:52:00.013 --> 01:52:01.548
OF YOUR ACTION I THINK THIS

01:52:01.614 --> 01:52:03.550
ACTUALLY DE POLITICIZE IS THE

01:52:03.616 --> 01:52:05.085
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FUND.

01:52:05.151 --> 01:52:07.320
BECAUSE WHEN SOMEBODY IS OUT OF

01:52:07.387 --> 01:52:09.656
WORK -- OFF AND AND AND I THINK

01:52:09.722 --> 01:52:10.890
IT WAS STATED AT NO FAULT OF

01:52:10.957 --> 01:52:12.625
THEIR OWN THEY STILL NEED TO PAY

01:52:12.692 --> 01:52:14.060
THE BILLS AND OUR ENTIRE

01:52:14.127 --> 01:52:15.662
COMMUNITY SUFFERS WHEN --

01:52:15.728 --> 01:52:17.163
WORKERS HAVE TO TAKE THE VERY

01:52:17.230 --> 01:52:19.065
EXTRAORDINARY STEP OF GOING ON

01:52:19.132 --> 01:52:20.567
STRIKE AND LET'S BE HONEST FOR

01:52:20.633 --> 01:52:22.135
OVER FOUR WEEKS.

01:52:22.202 --> 01:52:24.037
HAVING -- WALKED PICKET LINES

01:52:24.104 --> 01:52:25.505
WITH WORKERS WHO WHO WERE STUCK

01:52:25.572 --> 01:52:27.640
IN THAT POSITION I CAN I CAN

01:52:27.707 --> 01:52:29.008
TELL YOU THE PERSONAL HARDSHIP

01:52:29.075 --> 01:52:30.076
THAT THAT THEY AND THEIR

01:52:30.143 --> 01:52:31.878
FAMILIES HAVE TO SUSTAIN AND

01:52:31.945 --> 01:52:33.513
IT'S ALWAYS.

01:52:33.580 --> 01:52:34.747
A A IF THE STRIKE GOES ON THAT

01:52:34.814 --> 01:52:36.316
THAT LONG IT IS ALWAYS BECAUSE

01:52:36.382 --> 01:52:37.750
THEY ARE STRIKING FOR THEIR VERY

01:52:37.817 --> 01:52:40.520
LIVELIHOOD -- AND I THINK THAT

01:52:40.587 --> 01:52:42.822
THE PRESSURE ON EMPLOYERS TO

01:52:42.889 --> 01:52:45.525
SETTLE DISPUTES WILL GROW -- AND

01:52:45.592 --> 01:52:46.526
THAT'S PROBABLY A GOOD THING

01:52:46.593 --> 01:52:47.861
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT'S ALWAYS

01:52:47.927 --> 01:52:49.295
THE PRESSURE THE INDIVIDUALIZED

01:52:49.362 --> 01:52:51.131
PRESSURE ON THE WORKER TO GIVE

01:52:51.197 --> 01:52:52.899
IN IN A DISPUTE AND I THINK AN

01:52:52.966 --> 01:52:54.534
ENTIRE COMMUNITY ALL THESE

01:52:54.601 --> 01:52:56.136
BUSINESSES WILL BE AFFECTED BY

01:52:56.202 --> 01:52:58.238
THE EMPLOYMENT -- INSURANCE FUND

01:52:58.304 --> 01:53:00.006
WOULD BE WOULD ALSO THEN UP AT

01:53:00.073 --> 01:53:01.574
IT BE ABLE TO HAVE HONEST

01:53:01.641 --> 01:53:03.443
DISCUSSIONS WITH THE EMPLOYER AS

01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:05.278
WELL I THINK THAT THAT ADDS TO

01:53:05.345 --> 01:53:07.680
MORE BALANCE IN IN THE PROVISION.

01:53:07.747 --> 01:53:09.816
I WILL ALSO STATE THAT -- WE

01:53:09.883 --> 01:53:11.584
HAVE BEEN SITTING ON THIS BILL

01:53:11.651 --> 01:53:12.118
FOR IT SINCE I WAS ELECTED

01:53:12.185 --> 01:53:14.187
HONESTLY -- AND THAT IS BECAUSE

01:53:14.254 --> 01:53:15.822
IN OUR TALKS WITH THE INSURANCE

01:53:15.889 --> 01:53:17.557
COMMITTEE NET DE WE REALIZE THAT

01:53:17.624 --> 01:53:19.025
THE FUND WAS IN A BAD POSITION

01:53:19.092 --> 01:53:20.560
BUT WE ARE NO LONGER IN A BAD

01:53:20.627 --> 01:53:22.295
POSITION AND SO -- WE HAVE

01:53:22.362 --> 01:53:23.429
WAITED UNTIL WE ARE IN A

01:53:23.496 --> 01:53:25.198

02:01:12.298 --> 02:01:14.567
THE SYSTEM WE HAVE IN PLACE NOW

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES

WHILE THE EXISTING SYSTEM WAS

02:01:24.143 --> 02:01:25.277
DESIGNED TO SAVE MONEY FOR

02:01:25.344 --> 02:01:27.413

02:01:56.942 --> 02:01:58.778
WE FIND THAT REASONABLE

02:01:58.844 --> 02:02:00.413
DISCUSSIONS ARE PUSHED ASIDE.

02:02:00.479 --> 02:02:02.314
BY THE FALSE IDEA THAT THE

02:02:04.150 --> 02:02:05.785
AND IS SO SACROSANCT THAT THE

02:02:05.851 --> 02:02:07.887

02:02:18.064 --> 02:02:19.699
IT'S OKAY TO ADMIT THAT WE NEED

02:10:20.779 --> 02:10:22.414
FOR MANY MANY YEARS.

02:10:22.481 --> 02:10:25.050
AND IF THAT'S NOT A USED TO WORK

02:10:25.117 --> 02:10:31.323
BUT WORLD.

02:10:31.390 --> 02:10:33.091
I FIGURES WERE TRYING.

02:10:33.158 --> 02:10:35.694
I THINK IF I MAY OUT ALSO THE

02:10:35.761 --> 02:10:36.562
BRINGING THE EMPLOYERS TO THE

02:10:36.628 --> 02:10:37.162
TABLE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.

02:10:37.229 --> 02:10:38.030
BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT BENEFITED

02:10:38.096 --> 02:10:39.064
FROM THIS REFORM EITHER.

02:10:39.131 --> 02:10:40.165
THEIR RATES ARE STILL HIGH ADD

02:10:40.232 --> 02:10:40.732
TO TREATMENT IS STILL BEING

02:10:40.799 --> 02:10:42.401
DENIED AND STILL BEING DELAYED

02:10:42.467 --> 02:10:43.969
AND THAT WE KNOW THAT TO ONCE

02:10:44.036 --> 02:10:45.771
UTILIZATION REVIEW DENIES THE

02:10:45.837 --> 02:10:46.805
BENEFIT.

02:10:46.872 --> 02:10:48.207
AT THE I AM ALL I AM ARE --

02:10:48.273 --> 02:10:50.842
LEVEL JUST AS WAS NOTED EARLIER

02:10:50.909 --> 02:10:52.477
IT'S ALMOST ALWAYS TONIGHT.

02:10:52.544 --> 02:10:53.378
SO IF YOU HAVE A TREATING

02:10:53.445 --> 02:10:55.547
DOCTORS SAYING THIS TREATMENT IS

02:10:55.614 --> 02:10:56.548
NECESSARY.

02:10:56.615 --> 02:10:57.649
AND YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO'S

02:10:57.716 --> 02:10:59.818
NEVER EXAMINED THAT EMPLOYEE NOW

02:10:59.885 --> 02:11:01.386
COMING AND SAYING WE'VE REVIEWED

02:11:01.453 --> 02:11:03.188
THE RECORDS NEVER TOUCH THAT

02:11:03.255 --> 02:11:03.922
EMPLOYEE NEVER SPOKEN WITH

02:11:03.989 --> 02:11:05.891
EMPLOYEE WITH THAT TREATMENT IS

02:11:05.958 --> 02:11:06.692
NOT NECESSARY.

02:11:06.758 --> 02:11:08.193
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH

02:11:08.260 --> 02:11:09.962
THAT DISCONNECT WHEN YOU HAVE AN

02:11:10.028 --> 02:11:12.598
I AM OUR DOCTOR ABSOLUTELY

02:11:12.664 --> 02:11:15.701
DENYING A BENEFIT AFTER REVIEW.

02:11:15.767 --> 02:11:17.236
AND THAT THE IDENTITY OF THE I

02:11:17.302 --> 02:11:19.471
AM OUR DOCTOR WILL NEVER BE

02:11:19.538 --> 02:11:20.973
DISCLOSED UNDER LAW.

02:11:21.039 --> 02:11:23.075
THAT DOCTOR CAN NEVER BE DEPOSED

02:11:23.141 --> 02:11:24.910
UNDER LAW WE HAVE A SERIOUS

02:11:24.977 --> 02:11:26.545
PROBLEM WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

02:11:26.612 --> 02:11:28.914
TAKE CARE OF IT AT THE DOCTOR

02:11:28.981 --> 02:11:30.249
EMPLOYER.

02:11:30.315 --> 02:11:32.251
EMPLOYEE LEVEL AND I THINK BRING

02:11:32.317 --> 02:11:33.485
IN THE EMPLOYERS TO THE TABLE

02:11:33.552 --> 02:11:36.455
pIS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THIS IS

02:11:36.521 --> 02:11:39.291
TOO BIG AN ISSUE FOR ONE SIDE TO

02:11:39.358 --> 02:11:40.759
TO COME FORWARD WITH WITH.

02:11:40.826 --> 02:11:43.428
THE ONLY THE ONLY SOLUTION BUT

02:11:43.495 --> 02:11:45.497
THE SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE WE

02:11:45.564 --> 02:11:51.203
HAVE TOO MANY EMPLOYEES WITH

02:11:51.270 --> 02:11:51.503
[inaudible]

02:11:51.570 --> 02:11:52.938
LEGITIMATE ACCEPTED INJURIES

02:11:53.005 --> 02:11:53.405
WHERE THE DOCTORS ARE

02:11:53.472 --> 02:11:54.473
RECOMMENDING TREATMENT AND THE

02:11:54.539 --> 02:11:56.108
TREATMENT IS BEING DELAYED AND

02:11:56.174 --> 02:11:58.110
DELAYED WHEN YOU DELAY SOMETHING

02:11:58.176 --> 02:11:59.378
THAT LONG YOU ARE DENYING THE

02:11:59.444 --> 02:12:00.379
BENEFITS.

02:12:00.445 --> 02:12:02.314

INJURIES WHO HAD ASKED FOR

02:12:14.259 --> 02:12:16.061
TREATMENT DOCTORS TREATING

DOCTOR SELECTED BY THE EMPLOYER

02:12:17.796 --> 02:12:19.464
HAD RECOMMENDED TREATMENT AND

02:12:19.531 --> 02:12:21.933
YET THE TREATMENT WAS DENIED.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:23.235
THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE

02:12:23.302 --> 02:12:25.137
SYSTEM WHEN THAT IS ALLOWED TO

02:12:25.203 --> 02:12:26.004
HAPPEN.

02:12:26.071 --> 02:12:26.772
EMPLOYERS NEED TO BE AT THE

02:12:26.838 --> 02:12:28.507
