THANK DOCTOR PAN I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE- LIKE THE TO ANCHOR BILL MONTHLY WHO IS- ON THE CALL IN THE VERY BEGINNING OF PRESIDENT OF HIGHLAND PARK HOUSE EIGHT LITTLE A SIMILAR. AMOUNT ONLY ESPANOL IT UP FOR YOU BUT IT. GET OTHER FOR BUT IMPORTANT THAT. IN ANOTHER THEY WOULD ELICIT ON A THAT THE LOT THAT BUT THE SEA BUT AND DEMOCRATS THE STUFF. I DO QUESTION FOR YOU DOESN'T THE A POINT OF FOR IN. ON THE LOW THE FINE. HE IS THE- BELL FOR LATE INNING UP. THIS IS A THINK THE QUESTION THE ALL OF US WITH IN TRYING TO. ONE THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC. THROUGH THE BACK OF THE CASE ACROSS STATE THAT AT ARMS ARE MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS. FRONTLINE STAFF IN WAY. AND WOULD LOVE SOME FOR US DIFFERENCE OF. DATES BE TO NINETY FIVE SURGICAL MASKS AND WHAT IS OFFICE IN WHICH- WE CAN THINK ABOUT ONCE WE GET CLOSER TO OPERATION EIGHT. HASN'T USED. WILL IT THEN BE ROUTED OR USE THAT WE'RE NOT UP. TALKING UP TO SUPPLY MAY POTENTIALLY USE. I THOUGHT THAT THANKS MUCH OF% ONE FOR THAT C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;. IT'S A THE&lt;/c&gt;</u> THIS MODEL THAT ACTUAL DAY BASE ON WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT WE FOUND OUT WHAT TIME WHAT WAS FOUND THAT. THAT THEY SEE WHAT. WASN'T NO WAY BUT WHAT A FIGURED OUT WAS IS THAT WHAT YOU DO IS YOU HAVE TO BE COMING EN ROUTE YOU PER. SH FOR TIME AND YOU MOVE AT. AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE DIFFERENT PP IN WHAT EXPIRED. I MEAN IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT PERISHABLE ITEM LIKE FOOD SO OF THREE AMPLE THE PLASTICS ON THE AND FIVE. THAT YEAH JUST WHERE THE END AND IT. AND IT AND WEEKS OR SOME I CAN WEAR A WHILE SO THE IDEA IS THAT YOU WOULD BE ACTUALLY PURCHASED PP. YOU'RE GOING TO STAY AND THEN YOU MOVE OUT THE- LIST BARBARA STILL NOT EXT. IT THE OTHER WERE LOW WELL IF HE HAVE TO HAVE A SPACE ON WHAT YOU CURRENTLY USING SO WE'RE NOT EXPECT PEOPLE TO PP. THAT THE NORMALLY YOU ANYWAY BASICALLY EVENTUALLY WHAT HAPPENS YES YOU DO HAVE TO BUILD A STOCKPILE BUT THEN EVENTUALLY WHAT HAPPENED HE COMING. GOING OUT AND SO IT'S NOT ASIDE FROM THE STORAGE. WE SHOULD FACILITIES ARE READY TO RIGHT NOW. CURRENT TV THE PROBLEM WE RAN INTO IT THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE THAT HAVE STOCKPILES WHEN YOU'RE- WHEN THE SUPPLY COLLAPSES ENOUGH. NOT BRING THINGS IN. THEN NO ONE HAS ANYTHING. LEARNED AND THAT'S WHAT HE SAID OKAY EVERY HOSPITAL IT FEELS WILL HAVE TO HAVE YOUR LIFE BY THE TIME SO YOU'RE NOT PANIC. JUST CAN'T GET YOUR EVERY TRYING TO SUPPLY. IS THE TOP FOR THE ELITE STILL PROVIDE THE PROTECTION WE DON'T HAVE TO PANIC BUYING WE DON'T HAVE BOTH. MORE SO I CAN RUN A LOT OF LESSONS LEARNED FROM. WORKERS THAT I'VE SPOKE WITH ASKED. HOT HAD. PULLED OF P. BY.% I WAS MAKING SURE THAT THAT SUPPLY WAS BEING DISTRIBUTED. WHATEVER LENGTH OF TIME AND YOU KNOW HAVING. AND THAT MOVE AND SO I THINK NOT ONLY WAS THERE SHORTAGE BUT THOSE THAT DIDN'T HAVE A SHORTAGE COULDN'T USE UP AVAILABLE. WHICH THEN WE THOUGHT YOU KNOW NURSES. TRASH BAG UNIFORMS AND IS THE YOU KNOW AN UNFORTUNATE THING THAT WE ARE AT THE WE ARE SEEN- SO I WAS JUST CURIOUS AS TO HOW LONG AND TYPE OF P. CAN BE STORED AND WHAT WOULD THAT PROP LOOK LIKE THE NET YEAH YOU CAN DO IT SMARTER LIKE FOCUSED. PP THAT FOR A WHILE SUMMIT AND WE SHOULD THINK. MAINTAIN A SUPPLY THAT ACTUALLY WITH ANIMAL COPS. THAT THEN ALSO CANCEL BE SURE TO BE RE REPRESSION REPLENISH THE SUPPLY. AT ALL THERE IS THAT IT THINGS ARE JUST EXPERT. THANK YOU. THIRTY COMMENT SUBMERGENCE LATER YES IN A AND I WON THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD IN AND- A DEADLY GUNS. GOING TO SUPPORT BY THIS BILL AND- WHAT WHAT I REALLY AM. EXCITED ABOUT IS NOT NECESSARY TO WHO DID WHAT TO WEAR OR EVEN THE WIND BUT WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE A SERIOUS DISCUSSION ABOUT THE HOUSE. RIGHT AND A NIGHT IN DEATH BUT I MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP NINE NINE THAT WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU WOULD. LIST SOME OF MY HELP I JUST BE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS COORDINATOR FOR THE CITY OF LA. I WAS INVOLVED IN THE JUST EXCISED SANDBAGS OKAY THAT WE NEEDED FOR FLOOD NOW WE HAVEN'T HAD A FLOOD. IN QUITE SOME TIME IT'LL SAM SAID I. KEPT IN KEY NO I WOULD NINETEEN NINETY. PROBABLY AREN'T ANY. DON'T MOVE THEM OUT. AND RESUPPLY. AND SO IT'S REALLY ABOUT CREATING HOLD. CHAIN SYSTEM GOING STORAGE BUT WHAT I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN IS THE- IN STATE MANUFACTURE IT AND YOU KNOW I THE MANUFACTURER IN MY DISTRICT RIGHT NOW WHICH IS NOT A VERY GOOD. FACTOR TO GETTING BETTER NOW AND IT PULLED IT OUT. DOING WELL BUT TO THEY SAY THE DATE GONE FROM DOING CLOTHING TO A MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF. A MASS A MONTH- THAT'S IN MY DISTRICT SO THINK ABOUT THAT YEAH MY CLINICS. WHICH DIDN'T HAVE ANY SUPPORT WHATSOEVER WHEN IT COMES TO PP. LEAST THEY COULD BE PROVIDED IN MY DISTRICT WITH ENOUGH MASS AND WILL PROBABLY ALSO COULD HAVE A CHANCE TO. PROBABLY UNIONIZE A LOT OF MANUFACTURING IN MY DISTRICT WHICH PROBABLY WOULD ALSO HELP WITH MAKING SURE THOSE PEOPLE AT WORK IT INTO. ADDRESS IT. SO DAY I'M LOOKING AT HOW. THE STATE. PRODUCED TO THE PPVS THAT WE NEED SO WE DON'T HAVE TO GO OUT OF STATE OR OUT OF THE COUNTRY TO DEPEND ON THAT WE DO IT INTERNALLY AND AUTUMN THE USER RESOURCE THE MONEY IN THE STATE OF GUITAR WILL WORK WE DO NOT. STOCK WE DO NOT KEEP A STOCKPILE OF PLANES WE TURN FORD AND THE OTHER INDUSTRIES AND TO TANK MAKING THINGS TO FOR IN A MAJOR WAR A RAMP UP AND SO WE SHOULD BE DOING AT THE SAME HERE WITH PPVS AND I WOULD LOVE WITH YOU ON HOW WEAK IN TURN. GREAT JOB. TOPIC WHEN THE BUT IMPORTANT UP WE CREATE A SYSTEM WHERE WE BECOME SELF SUFFICIENT AT THE END OF THE DAY AND WE DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON IDAHO ALABAMA OR SOME OTHER STATE- TO REPLENISH OUR OURS. ALSO A GREAT. IS A BOND YOU MOVE THAT STUFF OUT TO THE DOES BECOME PERISHABLE BAND WAS LEFT PANDEMIC IN THE TWENTIES. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN EIGHTY SO THE NEXT ONE IS NOT UNTIL TWENTY ONE EIGHTEEN I WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE READY BY NOW WITH THE AROUND BUT I'M GONNA MAKE SURE WHERE. TWENTY ONE EIGHTEEN THAT WE'RE- THOSE INDIVIDUALS IN THE FUTURE- ARE ABLE TO DEAL WITH IT COULD BE MUCH WORSE FIFTY YEARS FROM NOW TWENTY YEARS. WE DO WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO BE SELF.

CHECK THE BEGINNING OF THE CALL THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC OUR COMPANIES HAVE BEEN PROVIDING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO WORKERS. ALTHOUGH THESE PROGRAMS VARY FROM COMPANY TO COMPANY. MOST ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THAT WELL THAT WAS REQUIRED THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER. NONETHELESS WE BELIEVE SB SEVEN TWENTY NINE COULD BE ENHANCED BY INCORPORATING INDUSTRY AND PUT. THE ECONOMIC REALITIES OF HOW OUR BUSINESSES OPERATE. BY THE BILL IS INTENDED TO PUT INTO STATUTE GOVERNING HOUSTON'S EXECUTIVE ORDER. IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THAT YEAH WASN'T DRAFTED TO REFLECT THE NEW ON THE DELIVERY. DRIVER WORK SUCH AS BEING ABLE TO WORK ON. PLATFORM. SIMULTANEOUSLY FIRST YOU TO INCLUDE DAYS AGO. CRITERIA DESIGN ENSURE. AND PREVENT PROJECT BEHAVIOR. OUR PLATFORMS ALLOW INDIVIDUALS TO QUICKLY SIGN UP AND BEGIN WORKING AS DRIVERS WHICH IS MADE THEN. THE USEFUL TOOL FOR PEOPLE TRYING TO FIND INCOME DURING THE PANDEMIC. WELL WE ARE PROUD OF IT'S READILY AVAILABLE ACCESS INCOME FOR CURRENT AND PROSPECTIVE WORKERS. WHICH IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. BUT ALSO. MAKE TYPICAL EMPLOYMENT BASED LIKE. OKAY. SEVEN TWENTY AND- PERFECT FOR THE PLATFORM. CURRENTLY THE BILL WOULD ALLOW WORKERS SIGNED THE CONTRACT HOURS CHRISTIAN DAY TO OBTAIN EIGHTY HOURS A SIX PACK. IN ORDER TO AVOID SOME AREAS LIKE THAT'S WHICH CREATED SIGNIFICANT RISK OF FRAUD AND WOULD NECESSITATE LIMITED ACCESS TO WORK MENTION ABOUT. WE PROPOSE TO DOCTOR TO INSTEAD USE LIMITED THRESHOLD ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR WORKERS TO QUALIFY FOR SICKLY. SWEET SECOND THE BILL DEFINED HIRING ENTITY TO INCLUDE TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANIES AND DELIVERY NETWORK COMPANIES FOR PURPOSES OF THE STATUTE. WE SUGGEST THAT THE BILL BE AMENDED TO MAKE IT. THE APPLICABILITY CLEAR REGARDLESS OF WORKERS CLASSIFICATION STATUS AND AVOID COSTLY LITIGATION. SPECIFICALLY INSTEAD OF USING A TERM HIRING THAT CAN YOU WE URGE YOU TO USE THE TERM COVERED ENTITY.

LIKE TOUCHING CUSTOMERS REUSABLE ITEMS BEING ABLE TO WATCH HAVE MORE FREQUENTLY. WRITING CLEAR SPECIAL DISTANCING DIRECTIONS WITHIN STORES AND FURTHER ENSURE CAL OSHA GUIDANCE FOR THE INDUSTRY HAS DEVELOPED IN THAT. SB SEVEN TWENTY NINE GOES BEYOND THAT DELIVERY AGREEMENT AND THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER AND EXTENSIVE SICKLY PROVISIONS THROUGH THE END OF THE DECLARED STATE OF EMERGENCY ORDER UNDER THE CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT. STATE OF EMERGENCY FREQUENTLY LAST LONGER THAN THE TIME OF THE PRESSING EMERGENCY HAND IN THIS CASE COULD POTENTIALLY LUCK MONTHS OR YEARS LONGER THAN THE STATE HOME ORDER. AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF SCIENTIFIC DATA AND A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER OR NONEXISTENT RISK OF CONTRACTION WE ANTICIPATE THE STAY AT HOME OR TO BE LIFTED WHEN IT IS LISTED. OTHER NONESSENTIAL BUSINESSES LIKE BARS BOWLING HOURS BOWLING ALLEYS- CONCERT VENUES WILL BE REOPENED. THE SEVEN TWENTY FIVE WOULD REQUIRE THE FOOD SECTOR TO CONTINUE OFFERING THE ADDITIONAL COVERAGE RELATED SUPPLEMENTAL PAID SICK LEAVE.

OF ALL THE VOTES WE GOT OUR- WE ARE HERE NOW- ITEM FOR SB TWELVE FIFTY SEVEN SENATOR DID ALSO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR CALIFORNIA'S THE OSHA CALIFORNIA OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ACT- OF EXCLUDES HELPFUL DOMESTIC SERVICE EMPLOYEES THIS BILL WOULD ELIMINATE THAT EXCLUSION AND RECENT AMENDMENTS OF ONE. AND RECENT AMENDMENTS DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION FOR PUBLICLY FUNDED HOUSEHOLD DOMESTIC SERVICE EMPLOYEES SUCH AS I AGE AS THE WORKERS. HOWEVER AS WE CONTINUED TO DIALOGUE WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND SOME MORE CLEARLY THE COMPLEXITY OF PUBLICLY FUNDED PROGRAMS AND IN RECOGNITION OF THEIR IMPORTANCE TO LOW INCOME POPULATIONS WE HAVE DECIDED TO EXCLUDE DOMESTIC SERVICE EMPLOYEES FUNDED BY GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS FROM THE BILL AS IT ADVANCES THIS YEAR. WE HAVE REACHED OUT TO MANY STATE COLD AND- WE HAVE. BASIC CONSENSUS WE WILL TAKE AMENDMENT TO THAT EFFECT THAT THE NEXT OPPORTUNITY TO AMEND THE BILL WE HOPE TO CONTINUE TO WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS TO FIND THE BEST WAY TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF ALL PARTIES THIS BILL REMOVES A HISTORICALLY DISCRIMINATORY EXCLUSION IT'S PART OF ADDRESSING A LONG HISTORY OF EXCLUSION OF DOMESTIC WORKERS FROM BASIC LABOR PROTECTIONS AND AS PART OF OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY OF RACISM. IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES WHEN DOMESTIC WORKER THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY PERFORMED BY SLAVES WAS NOW STILL BEING DONE BY AFRICAN AMERICANS FEDERAL LAWS WERE PASSED THAT EXCLUDED THIS WORK. FROM BASIC WORKPLACE PROTECTION THIS YEAR THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS ENSURING THAT ALL MEN AND WOMEN HAVE A SAFE PLACE TO CARRY OUT THE WORK THIS BILL EXTENDS OSHA PROTECTIONS TO PRIVATE A HOUSEHOLD OF A STICK SERVICE EMPLOYEES. DOMESTIC WORKERS ARE COVERED UNDER OTHER WORKPLACE RIGHTS LIKE MINIMUM WAGE OVERTIME A WORKERS COMPENSATION. THIS TO THESE CHANGES ARE MADE SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND ESTABLISH THE EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP. CHILD CARE PROVIDERS ARE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF WHERE HOME IS ALSO THE WORKPLACE. HERE ARE DUE PROCESS SAFEGUARDS WITHIN THE BILL THE BALANCE THE NEED FOR PRIVACY WITH COMPLIANCE. IN RECOGNITION OF THE UNIQUENESS OF A RESIDENTIAL DO WELL IN THE WORKPLACE. FIRST CONTACT WITH AN EMPLOYER IN RESPONSE TO AN ALLEGED VIOLATION RECEIVE FROM A DOMESTIC. EMPLOYEE WILL BE BY TELEPHONE. YES OF COURSE THERE IS AN INJURY. ARE RESULTING. ADDITIONALLY THE BILL CALLS UPON OSHA TO CONVENE AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO EVALUATE AND THREE SPECIFIC REGULATIONS RELATED TO HOUSEHOLD DOMESTIC SERVICE. AND FOR THAT ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO BE EQUALLY BALANCED BETWEEN EMPLOYER HOMEOWNERS AND EMPLOYEES. DOMESTIC WORKERS WHO ARE PRIMARILY IMMIGRANT WORK AND WORK. WOMEN WORKFORCE ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY AND THEY DESERVE CONSIDERATION JUST LIKE ANY OTHER WORKING MAN OR WOMAN. WE CANNOT X. CONTINUE TO EXCLUDE THIS GROUP OF WORKERS NOT DURING THE HEALTH PANDEMIC NOT DURING THE WILDFIRES THAT THE MASTER WORKERS HELP TO CLEAN UP NOT IN THE EVERYDAY WORK THAT PUTS OUR HEALTH AND WELL BEING. AND THEIR FAMILIES ON THE LINE DURING THE WILD FIRES THAT DEVASTATE CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLD DOMESTIC SERVICE EMPLOYEES. WERE ASKED TO STAY BEHIND TO FIGHT FIRES GUARD HOMES OR PETS WORK IN. SMOKY CONDITIONS AND CLEAN UP TOXIC ASH EMPLOYERS ALL FELT IT MANY THEM THAT THE HOMES THERE WORKING THAT WERE UNDER MANDATORY EVACUATION ORDERS. THE CURRENT NINETEEN HEALTH PANDEMIC HAS ONLY FURTHER MAGNIFY THE VULNERABILITIES AND DANGERS THE DOMESTIC WORKERS AND DAY LABORS FACE ON A DAILY BASIS. BECAUSE THEY ARE EXCLUDED FROM CALIFORNIA'S A FAILED THIS THE LAWS AS OUR WILD FIRES GROWING FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY. AS A PANDEMIC DISPROPORTIONATE TO WRAP LOW INCOME.

YOU CAN RECORD. BETTER AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT EVERY INDUSTRIES WORKPLACE IS DIFFERENT AND THAT HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS SHOULD REFLECT THE REALITIES AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH PARTICULAR INDUSTRY. BUT THE FACT IS THAT CAL OSHA NOW CANNOT EVEN PROVIDE ANY GUIDANCE ON HOW TO PROTECT DOMESTIC WORKERS DURING FIRES OR DURING. THE NINETEEN BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO JURISDICTION OVER THE TYPE OF IMPORTANT WORK THIS BILL THAT'S WHAT THE- THAT IS YOU NEED TO THE MATH. SERVICE ONE THAT IS NON INTRUSIVE BASED ON.

I'LL GET TO SEE IT AGAIN AND- I THINK IF I'M NOT A CO AUTHOR ALREADY I'D LIKE TO BE ONE- I JUST WANT TO REMIND FOLKS WHO MIGHT BE WATCHING THOUGH BECAUSE WE KEEP GETTING THIS QUESTION- HOW IT WHETHER IT THERE ARE OTHER RIGHTS THAT DOMESTIC WORKERS AND HOUSEHOLD EMPLOYEES HAVE. AND I KNOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR PEOPLE TO COME IN THEIR HOMES RIGHT NOW TO HELP MAYBE WITH THEIR FRIENDS AND ALL OF THAT IS GOVERNED IT'S NOT COVERED BY AB FIVE IT WAS IT WAS PART OF LAW LONG BEFORE AB FIVE IT FEDERAL TAX IRA. BUT GOOD HOUSEHOLD EMPLOYEES IN ET DE AND THE RULES OF CLEAR SUCH AS WHAT PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE IN A TUNNEL THERE'S- WE- WASN'T. A FIVE ALL LONG GOING TO JAIL WE COULD. IN YOU WOULD SEE HAVE TO EMPLOY A PRO. HOUSEHOLD EMPLOYEES AND SO THANK YOU EVERY TIME YOU. BRING A BILL I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE- OPERATE OUTSIDE OF THE LAW IN THIS.

PLACE I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THEM THANK AT. THE CORPORATE. YEAH ANYONE ELSE THINK. THE YEAH I ALSO WOULD BE HONORED A CO AUTHOR THIS BILL AND AS YOU INDICATED IN YOUR INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS SENATOR TO ALSO- THIS REALLY DOES THIS IS ABOUT HIS HISTORIC INJUSTICES HISTORIC RACISM. BUT IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR US IS TO ACKNOWLEDGE HISTORIC SYSTEMIC RACISM UNLESS WE'RE WILLING TO ACT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT TODAY- TO SUMMER JONES PLAYERS UP COMMENTS I THINK THAT SPEAKS TO A LINEAR SYSTEM SOME THAT WE ALL KNOW HOW TO REDUCE ABOUT SO I'M VERY GRATEFUL ONE LAST POINT AND SENT THE- A LITTLE BIT FROM. THE THIRTY REALLY APPRECIATE WORK ON THE BECAUSE I KNOW YOU OF COURSE CLEARLY THERE IS THERE SOME DIVEST WORKERS ARE CARING FOR THOSE THAT. MAY NOT HAVE THE ABILITY. pCONDITIONS THE ANSWER ISN'T TO INTRODUCE- DOMESTIC WORKER TO POOR ROAD CONDITIONS THE ANSWER IS TO GET HELP. THE PERSON WITH A DISABILITY TO IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE AS WELL AND WE CAN REALLY CREATE A WIN WIN OUT OF THIS. FOR THE WORKER AND FOR THOSE THEIR CARING FOR AND I THINK ULTIMATELY THAT'S WHAT I KNOW YOU BELIEVE IN AND- SO I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON THAT. WE DO HAVE A- MOTION AND OF THIS.

NEIGHBORHOOD OF ALL THESE THINGS I WON'T GET INTO DETAILS BUT- LAST WEEK WEEK OR SO AGO- TWO WEEKS WE LEARNED OF AN LA BASED FACTORY. THAT EXPRESS AN OUTBREAK OF ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED POSITIVE COVERT CASES AND FOUR DEATHS SO SB NINE NINE PROTECT WORKERS YES ABSOLUTELY BUT IT ALSO PROTECTS BUSINESSES. WHO DO THE RIGHT THING TO DO I'LL GIVE THE PROTECTIONS TO DO PAY THE RIGHT THING SO THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IN THIS BILL ELIMINATING THE PIECE RATE IN THE INDUSTRY SOME. WORKERS CAN STILL EARN INCENTIVE BASED BONUSES ABOVE THEIR LEGAL WAGES SO. I'VE HEARD- HOW ARE WE GOING TO YOU KNOW INCENTIVIZE BLAH BLAH BLAH. PAY THE LEGAL WAGE AND THEN YOU CAN HAVE A BONUS ON TOP. AND FORCING LIABILITY UP. MORE FORCE MEANT OF LIABILITY FOR WAGE VIOLATIONS- CREATE A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION AS TO THE IDENTITIES OF THE GUARANTORS. BASED ON THE GARMENT WORKERS TESTIMONY BECAUSE THEY HAVE INFORMATION LIKE THEY TAKE THE LABELS THEY HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT IDENTIFIES A GROWING TOWARDS AND THAT'S WHAT. WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE. EXPLICITLY AUTHORIZED THE LABOR COMMISSIONER OF A BUREAU FIELD ENFORCEMENT TO INVESTIGATE AND SITE THE BRANDS. WAS A WAGE THE DARK REPORT- COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I THINK OF THAT REPORT THAT STAND OUT OF. TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN LOST EARNINGS ONE IN THE THIRD MILLION DOLLARS IN LOST INCOME TAX.

GET PAID WHAT THEY SHOULD BUT ALSO THE LOSS TO THE STATE THE LOSS TO MONEY THAT SHOULD BE COMING INTO THE STATE- OF MANY MANUFACTURERS HAVE NO INCENTIVE.

HELLO EVERYONE DANIEL MOLINA CALIFORNIA STATE DIRECTOR OF MISSION TO LIVE OUT THE SUPPORT OF SB THIRTY NINE NINE. THANK YOU. ALL IGHT SO- WILL MOVE ON TO A POSITION IN TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION WE HAVE BEEN HAVING WITH CAL OF CAL CHAMBER BY PHONE. THANK YOU MISTER. CHAIR AND MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON BUT I'VE BECOME HALF WHICH CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE ARE OPPOSE THAT THIRTEEN A NINE. BUT WE DO NOT TO KIDDO WHICH THE IN ANY. HOWEVER THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT BILL THAT MAKES A NUMBER OF DRAMATIC CHANGES TO THE REGULATION OF GARMENT MANUFACTURING THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO IT AB SIX THIRTY THREE BY THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER STEINBERG. NUMBER OF SPECIFIC CONCERT WITH THIS PROPOSAL AT FIRST THIS BILL ELIMINATE PIECE COP AND- THE IS WITHOUT PRECEDENT AND SHOULD BE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED. THAT WE GENERALLY DO NOT LIMIT HOW AN EMPLOYER IN ANY INDUSTRY MAY COMPENSATE WORKERS BE AT DOLLERY HOURLY OR PIECE RATE. ARKANSAS APPLET MINIMAL WAITED OVERTIME LAWS ARE COMPLIED WITH. IF WORKERS ARE BEING PAID PIECE RATES THAT ARE BEING PAID LESS THAN THE MINIMUM WAGE THAT IS A VIOLATION OF EXISTING LAW WE WOULD SUGGEST THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE RATHER THAN HE NEED TO ELIMINATE A LONGSTANDING FORM OF COMPENSATION IN THE INDUSTRY AND SUCH AN- UNPRECEDENTED BANNER. SECOND THIS BILL IMPOSES AUTOMATIC JOINT LIABILITY ON BRANDS. THIS IS A MAJOR POLICY ISSUE AND WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH IMPOSING. LIABILITY ON ANOTHER ENTITY THAT HAS NO CONTROL OVER THE WORKING CONDITIONS. A PREVIOUS BILLS RELATED TO JOINT LIABILITY ALSO HAVE ALL GONE THROUGH THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THAN THIS BILL HAS LOCKED. THIRD THE BILL ESTABLISHES A NEW CATEGORY OF BRAND GEAR TOURS. WHICH IS SO BROADLY DEFINED THAT INCLUDES ANY PERSON OR ENTITY IN THE CLOTHING INDUSTRY. THE DRY CLEANERS SMALL LARGE RETAILERS SECOND HAND RETAILERS AND MANY MORE. FOR THIS BILL IMPROPERLY CREATES TWO SEPARATE EVIDENTIARY STANDARDS A PRESUMPTION OF JOINT LIABILITY IS CREATED WHERE AN EMPLOYEE NEARLY PRODUCES A LABEL. BUT THE PLAYER CANNOT DEFEND WITH WITNESS DECLARATION. AND STATEMENTS PROVIDE OTHER QUOTE COMPELLING AND RELIABLE WRITTEN EVIDENCE. THIS IS FUNDAMENTALLY I'M IMPROPER AND VIOLATES DUE PROCESS TO OPPOSED TO DIFFERENT EVIDENTIARY STANDARDS. AND ISSUE HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED BY THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. I MANY OF THE NEW PER DO NOT APPLY WHERE THERE'S A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WHICH WE BELIEVE IS IMPROPER GREETS INCONSISTENT STANDARDS AND LIKELY RUN THE FILE THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT. FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE. AND ASKED FOR A NO VOTE ON SB THIRTEEN NINETY NINE WE RESPECTFULLY SUGGEST THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR DISCUSSION NEXT YEAR WHEN IT COULD BE PROPERLY BY THE BY ALL OF THE RELEVANT. COMMITTEES THANK YOU. THANK YOU- WE WILL GO ON TO PUBLIC COMMENT ANYONE IN THE ROOM. WILL MOVE ON TO REMOTE TESTIMONY STATION. AND THEN I FINALLY MODERATOR OF WE CAN HAVE- OPPOSITION IS ON THE PHONE AGAIN NAME PHILLIES. AND THE POSITION. SHARE YOUR POSITION IN OPPOSITION OF SB THIRTEEN NINETY NINE YOU MAY PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. WE DO HAVE ONE LINE ONE MOMENT. LINE THREE FORTY FOUR YOUR LINE IS OPEN. CALLER ONLINE THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR PLEASE GO AHEAD. THERE ARE NO OTHER COMMENTS IN Q. THAT CONTINUE. OKAY BRING ABOUT COMMITTEE. SERVICE. THANK YOU I JUST WANNA THANK YOU SENATOR DRAWS- FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- IT'S VERY PERSONAL TO ME I REMEMBER AS A KID YOU KNOW WE HAD FAMILY FRIENDS THAT WORKED IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY AND I REMEMBER GOING TO THESE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES THAT ARE IN MY DISTRICT IN SAN FERNANDO AND IN WATCHING WHAT THEY DID AND WHEN I REMEMBER EVEN AS A KID MATH DIDN'T UP YOU KNOW LIKE THINKING OF. YOU KNOW THIS WOMAN THE WOMEN THERE GETTING PAID PIECE BY PIECE AND I WOULD MULTIPLY IT BY HOW MANY THEY CAN DO PER HOUR AND EVEN THOUGH I WAS REALLY YOUNG IS LIKE THIS IS NOT FAIR IT'S NOT A LIVABLE WAGE IT'S NOT EVEN MINIMUM WAGE- IN SO JUST JUST REMEMBERING THOSE MOMENTS AS A CHILD YOU KNOW THOSE FACTORIES HAVING WALKING THEN AND IN GAME. AN EXPLOIT IT HEY EN. X. AND THE OTHER. WELL I'M YES SEVERAL THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR THE RAFFLE FOR BRINGING THIS BILL ECHO MY COLLEAGUE SENTIMENT AND I WOULD ALSO ECHO THAT AND STATE THAT FOR MANY OF THE MANUFACTURERS IN OUR COMMUNITY AND CLOSE TO DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES WHO EMPLOYEE- THE IS VERY IMPORTANT AND ESSENTIAL WORKERS THEY SHOULD BE INCREDIBLY ASHAMED FOR NOT PROVIDING THE NECESSARY PROTECTIONS FOR THE WORKERS FOR NOT PROVIDING THE SPACE NECESSARY. THERE WERE OVER THREE HUNDRED GARMENT WORKERS IN LOS ANGELES ALONE THE TESTED POSITIVE FOR THAT IS COMPLETE UNACCEPTABLE IT HAS BROUGHT LIGHT ON HOW COMMUNITY THE LATINO IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE THESE WORKERS ARE MOST DEMOCRATS IN A WOMEN ARE. EXCLUDED FROM PROTECTIONS AND SEEN AS- INVALUABLE BARB LESS THAN AND THEY'RE PROTECTIONS AND IN OUR ABILITY FOR SOCIETY TO ACKNOWLEDGE. THE IMPORTANCE OF THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY AND FOR THAT I AM THANKFUL TO YOU IN YOUR LEADERSHIP TO BE ABLE TO OFFER SUPPORT TO THESE WORKERS AND TO SHED LIGHT AGAIN ON THE INCREDIBLE INJUSTICE HAPPENS IN THE WORKPLACE WHEN WORKERS ARE OFTEN IGNORED OR LEFT ON. SO THANK YOU. TO LEARN CONSULT. THANK YOU I'M PROUD TO BE A AT PRINCIPLE CO AUTHOR- ON THIS BILL AND I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO SOME OF THE GARMENT WORKERS IN LA AND I I'LL JUST NEVER FORGET THE WOMAN'S STORY OF- HAVING TO GO RIGHT BACK TO WORK TO MAKE ENOUGH- AFTER SHE'D HAD A BABY IN BRINGING THE BABY WITH HER TO THE FACTORY IN PUTTING THE BABY IN A BOX- BECAUSE SHE HAD TO SHE JUST HAD A SO PASSED IN AND GET SO MUCH DONE. AND THERE WAS NO OTHER OPTION- THESE ARE THE KIND CONDITIONS WE HAVE RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND IT'S DEPLORABLE AND YOU KNOW SO MANY OF US EVER BEING COLLEGE THERE IS A BIG- NATIONAL CAMPAIGN ABOUT SWEAT SHOPS IN COLLEGE T. SHIRTS AND WHAT WE HOW WE COULD LOOK AT- THE THESE MANUFACTURERS AND WHERE THEY WERE GETTING THEIR PRODUCTS AND THIS IS OVERSEAS AND WE DIDN'T THINK ABOUT IT HAPPENING RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA ME SOME OF US DID. WHAT YOU KNOW BUT- WE KNEW IT HAPPENED AND SO WHEN THESE MANUFACTURERS SAY THAT THEY HAVE NO CONTROL OF IT. WE'VE WATCH THEM IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES GO AND SEND INSPECTORS AND THIS IS JUST RIGHT DOWN THE STREET FROM THEIR OFFICES. SO I THINK THIS IS THERE'S NO EXCUSE THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR THAT THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR THIS KIND OF WAGE THAT. AND IT'S TIME THAT WE HAVE LIABILITY FOR THOSE WHO ARE ARE PURCHASING THE CLOTHES AND JUST SUBCONTRACTING OUT DOES NOT. IT DOESN'T HELP. WHAT RIGHT SO. THANK YOU IT'S- ONE OF MY FAVORITE BILLS OF THE YEAR IS YOU KNOW. I WAS SO JEALOUS THAT YOU GOT IT BEFORE I DID HAVE. BUT I AM PROUD TO BE YOUR PRINCIPAL- CO AUTHOR AND A LOOK FORWARD TO HOPEFULLY PRESENTING ON THE FLOOR. THANK YOU SOMERS OCTOBER AND I TO APPOINT A THANK YOU AND I ALSO THINK WE ON BEHALF OF PEOPLE TO FIFTY NINE ASSEMBLY DISTRICT OP THE- LA APPAREL IS IN MY DISTRICT. LA PERILS WHERE THEY HAD HUNDREDS OF INDIVIDUAL OF EMPLOYEES THE HEAD COVE IT. AND SEVERAL DIED. RESET IT AGAIN SEVERAL DIED AND SO THAT OWNER IS NOW. NOT ONLY THE GREAT WORK OF LA COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH SHUTTING THEM DOWN. PUTTING IN- THE KIND OF PROTECTIONS THAT ARE NEEDED OF THIS INDIVIDUAL PUTTING CARDBOARD IN BETWEEN EACH PERSON IS STEP PLEXIGLASS. AND HE THOUGHT THAT CARDBOARD WOULD KEEP CORONAVIRUS FROM GOING TO EACH PERSON. OF I ALSO TOLD HIM THIS IS A CHANCE FOR REDEMPTION EVEN TOLD OF THE CHAMBER AND MANY FACTORS THAT WE NEED TO COME IN TO IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AND START WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WORKERS ARE SAFE. ESPECIALLY NOT IT WE GOT TO ISSUED UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY AND FORTUNE IS A TERRIBLE OPPORTUNITY BUT IT BUT THIS OPPORTUNITY TO CLEAN UP. THIS THE SWEATSHOPS IN A WAY THAT WE NEVER HAD BEFORE AND USE ALL OUR RESOURCES BECAUSE IT'S A HEALTH RISK IT'S A HEALTH DISASTER RIGHT NOW AND IF WE DO THAT NOW STARTING NOW. AND START TO GET MORE MORE THESE MANUFACTURERS TO DO THAT- WHEN WE COME OUT OF THIS I THINK WOULD HAVE COME OUT THIS MUCH BETTER YOUR BILL. WILL GET IS THERE MUCH FURTHER MUCH QUICKER AND IF WE ALL COME TOGETHER. TO MAKE HAPPEN AYE I THINK- FIVE YEARS DOWN THE LINE WE WILL REMEMBER THIS DAY THAT WE VOTED FOR THIS. BOOK. BY AND I WOULD LOVE TO BE CO AUTHOR ALSO. BUT THEY ONE IN I ALSO LOVE TO BE A CO AUTHOR ON THIS BILL I THINK IT'S A WONDERFUL BILL- AND TO- ESTARá CORREOS POINT TALKING ABOUT. THE COVERT FATALITIES COVETED FACTION. FOR EXAMPLE A CO IT IS NOT CREATING A IS SIX. EXISTING LONG STANDING INEQUITIES AND JUST BECAUSE A PRACTICES LONGSTANDING DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT. AND SO YOU KNOW I'VE I READ RECENTLY EVEN OF A OF A NOVEL THAT DEALT WITH GREEN AMERICAN FAMILY TALK ABOUT THE HISTORIC ORIGINS OF CREATE TOWN. AND HOW THIS PRACTICE IS YOU KNOW IT'S EMBEDDED IN SO MANY IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES NOT AND- WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND- IF WE DON'T- IF THERE IS A LIABILITY EXTENDED TO THE BRAND NAME ON THE LABEL- THEY CAN JUST TURN A BLIND EYE AND I KNEW THEY WOULD PREFER NOT TO HAVE LIABILITY. THEY PREFER TO HAVE NO PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY. BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THESE LABELS- ARE DOING THIS AROUND THE WORLD AND THE INTERNET. FOR RATIONS- I'M BUT YOU KNOW WE CAN'T. WE CAN'T. IN A TELL OTHER COUNTRIES TO GET THEIR ACT AS A PREFERRED NOT. THREE WE CAN IN OUR OWN BACKYARD. AND SO I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO YOU ABOUT THIS BILL FORWARD WE DO HAVE A MOTION ON THE FLOOR FROM THE SUMMER GONZALEZ SECONDED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS A SENATOR- THAT ALSO WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE SOME CLOSING COMMENTS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR BEAUTIFUL REMARKS- ON BEHALF OF THOSE WORKERS- THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH AND RESPECTFUL EFFORT I WILL. YOUR A MUSLIM CAN TAKE WILL. MOTION IS TO PASSED APPROACH KALRA HI KALRA AYE FLORA FLORA NO CARILLO. I DEEP. GONZALEZ AND SALAS AYE JONES SAWYER BY TEN SQUARE HI THREE OF US THREE OF US I THOUGHT ALL RIGHT I THAT BILL IS OUT THANK YOU SENATOR RUSSELL FOR THE PRESENTATION ON BOTH YOUR BILL TODAY. UP NEXT WE HAVE THE- SENATOR JACKSON WITH SB. NINE SEVENTY THREE. HE'S SENATOR JACKSON- MAKE YOUR WAY UP AND WHENEVER YOU'RE READY TO GO FEEL FREE TO BEGIN. THANK YOU. GIVEN THAT LOVE FEST. THE SAME OFF. NINE SEVENTY THREE ALL RIGHT SAID HE IS SO. A MEASURE THAT. YOU HAVE I THINK HEARD BEFORE. ARE SIMILAR TO I THINK- WHAT HAS COME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE TWICE- IT'S A BILL THAT IS DESIGNED TO FIGHT PAY DISCRIMINATION WITH DATA WITH INFORMATION BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO PAY EQUITY FOR WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. I BELIEVE WE CAN'T FIX WHAT WE DON'T KNOW. AND WE CERTAINLY CAN'T FIX WHAT WE CAN'T SHOW. SO THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE LARGE EMPLOYERS TO SUBMIT A PAID OUT A REPORT EVERY YEAR. TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING OUTLINING THE COMPENSATION AN HOUR'S WORK OF EMPLOYEES BY GENDER. BY RACE BY ETHNICITY AND JOB CATEGORY. IN RESPONSE TO BUSINESS COMMUNITY CONCERNS THIS DATA WILL NOT BE MADE PUBLIC. BUT IT WILL HELP FIGHT GENDER AND RACE BASED PAY DISCRIMINATION IN IMPORTANT WAYS FIRST. IT WILL ENCOURAGE EMPLOYERS TO ANALYZE THEIR OWN PAY DATA. AND PROMOTION PRACTICES AND ALLOW FOR SELF CORRECTION IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY IF YOU WILL FOR THESE COMPANIES TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR. SEE EXACTLY WHAT IT IS THEY'RE DOING BECAUSE FOUGHT ONE OF THE KEY CONTRIBUTORS TO THE PAY GAP IS WHAT IS CALLED JOB SEGREGATION. THE CONCENTRATION OF WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR IN CERTAIN USUALLY MUCH LOWER. OUR WAGE POSITIONS IN A COMPANY OFTEN COMPANIES REALLY AREN'T AWARE OF THESE PATTERNS AND PRACTICES- WITHIN THEIR OWN ORGANIZATION UNTIL THEY LOOK AT THEM CAREFULLY AND CRITICALLY. THE BILL ALSO ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING TO GATHER IMPORTANT DATA THAT ALLOWS HIM TO SEE PATTERNS OF WAGE DISCRIMINATION AND IF THEY NOTICED DEVIATIONS OR OUT LIARS TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER. THIS DATA WILL THUS HELP THE FE H. STRENGTHENING PRIORITIZE THEIR ENFORCEMENT PRACTICES. THE BILL ALSO STRING TO. THROUGH STRENGTHENS. IT'S REALLY HARD TALKING WITH THE- THIS BILL ALSO STRENGTHENS ENFORCEMENT OF THE CALIFORNIA FAIR PAY ACT BY ALLOWING THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING ALSO ENFORCE THE FAIR PAY ACT IN COORDINATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT. NOW THIS BILL IS CLOSELY MODELED AFTER EFFORTS THAT WE STARTED DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION BUT WERE HALTED BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MAKING IT FRANKLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER THAT WE PURSUE HERE IN CALIFORNIA OUR OWN PATH. AND IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING IF THIS X. A DIFFERENCE LAST YEAR INTEL. VOLUNTARILY RELEASED THE STATUS THEY HAD DONE THE STUDY AND IT REVEALED THE FORTY ONE OF FIFTY TWO TOP EXECUTIVES MAKING MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FORMAT. AND 37% WERE WHITE. SO TO THEM THIS ACTUALLY WAS AN EYE OPENING REVELATIONS BOTH OF THEM AND TO THE WIDER COMMUNITY AND LED TO CALLS AND EFFORTS BY THEM TO CHANGE. MEMBERS THE PAY GAP REMAINS A SERIOUS PROBLEM WE'VE DONE LEGISLATION HERE AND I'VE BEEN HONORED TO WORK WITH A NUMBER OF YOU ON THOSE- EFFORTS- DURING THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. BUT IT IS A PROBLEM THAT TO THIS DAY CONTINUES TO COST AN ESTIMATED SEVENTY NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN LOST WAGES A YEAR. FOR CALIFORNIA'S FAMILIES WOMEN ARE BEING ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY THIS COVERT NINETEEN ECONOMIC CRISIS EVERY DAY THERE'S AN ARTICLE THAT TALKS ABOUT. HOW THIS IS IMPACTING WOMEN AND THEIR ABILITY TO WORK IN THE WORKFORCE WOMEN DROPPING OUT- WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THIS IS OVER AND HOPEFULLY SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. WHERE ARE WE GOING TO BE WE ARE GOING TO NEED TO LOOK AT THIS THINGS HAVE BEEN BAD EVEN BEFORE THE CALL OVER TO WHERE IT WILL BE VERY MUCH IN COMMON UPON US. TO SPEAK THE- OF THIS GOING FOR. AS WELL. WITH AN BY MENTIONING WITHOUT THIS PAY. RE RE T&lt;c.cyan&gt; PRINT&lt;/c&gt; THAT WE WILL NOT FULLY CLOSE THE PAY GAP. FOR A HUNDRED AND ONE YEARS. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I DON'T THINK I'LL BE. SO I CAN'T LOG AND I SUSPECT YOU CAN HAVE THEM EITHER AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU YEAH THANK YOU YOU HAVE TO WHICH SAYS WILL JOIN REMOTELY- JESSICA STANDER WITH EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES. AND PATRICIA SHOE WHO IS THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE FEDERAL CONTRACT COMPLIANCE.

THAT IMPORTER CAN TAKE A CLOSER LOOK TO DETERMINE IF CHANGES ARE NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW. IT MAY NOT REVEAL A DIRECT VIOLATIONS OF THE LAW THAT WILL HELP THEM LOOK FURTHER TO SEE IF THEY NEED TO MAKE SUCH CHANGES. SIMILARLY MANY EMPLOYERS OF ALREADY RECOGNIZE THIS NEED INCLUDING FAILED FOR GAP STARBUCKS. AT REGULARLY CONDUCTED PAY AUDIT. WHAT AND IT MADE CHANGES TO THEIR PAY UPON REALIZING THEY NEED TO DO THAT COMPLY WITH THE LAW. FINALLY IT WILL HELP OUR PA OUR STATE AGENCIES MORE EFFICIENTLY USE THEIR RESOURCES.

INCLUDING ON HER LANDMARK- SB THREE EIGHT WHICH WE TO SUPPORT HOWEVER WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL I'LL BE BRIEF BE THE DEAD HORSES DISCUSSED. BILLS OVER THE LAST YEARS.

DID EDUCATION EXPIRY LEVELS. YOU MAY HAVE TO THAT HAVE SAME JOB TITLE BUT ONE HAS BEEN EMPLOYED FOR. YEAR AND ANOTHER FOR ONLY SIX MONTHS- OUR CONCERN IS THAT THIS INFORMATION WOULD GIVE A FALSE IMPRESSION OF PAY DISPARITY. ESPECIALLY THIS INFORMATION IS PROVIDED TO ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. WE PRESENT WILL ACT UPON THE INFORMATION. RECEIVED I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT BRIEFLY ON WHAT IS NEW IN THIS BILL COMPARED TO PREVIOUS. VERSION AND THAT IS THE PROVISION IN SECTION. THE BILL THAT AUTHORIZES THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING IN ADDITION TO THE LABOR COMMISSIONER TO INVESTIGATE AND ENFORCE EQUAL PAY ACT CLAIMS. WE'VE TALKED TO THE AUTHORS OFFICE BETTER CONCERT WE APPRECIATE THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT CLARIFIES. THAT ONLY ONE AGENCY WELL THE BEST TO GET THE SAME SET OF FACTS. BUT NEVER THE LESS WE HAVE CONCERNED ANY YOU HAVE TWO DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES AND FORCING THE SAME BODY OF LAW. AND THE POTENTIAL CONFUSION AND INCONSISTENT ENFORCEMENT THAT CAN RESULT. AT THE CONSISTENT POSITION WE'VE EXPRESSED ON A NUMBER OF BILLS IN RECENT YEARS. AND WE THINK UNFORTUNATELY IT'S A RECIPE FOR CONFUSION AND CONFLICT.

THANK YOU WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE THANK YOU. SO SAID BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS. AS ONE TO MAKE A QUICK COMMENT THANK YOU- SENATOR JACKSON FOR CONTINUING YOUR FIGHT TO END A NARROW THIS WAGE GAP- I THINK ESPECIALLY AS A LATINA- YOU KNOW WE ARE THE FURTHEST RIGHT- THAT WE HAVE THE WIDEST WHICH GAP IN COMPARE. TO OUR WHITE MALE COUNTERPART CITY WE GET FIFTY THREE CENTSON THE DOLLAR- I'M IN EVEN WITH HIGHER EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT AND YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IT THE GAP IS STILL VERY WIDE- IN SO I THINK THAT. BY COLLECTING THIS DATA WILL BE ABLE TO SEE IT LIKE YOU SAID IF THERE ARE ANY PATTERNS AND I HOPE THAT CORPORATE WOULD USE THIS MAKE MORE DATA DRIVEN DECISIONS AND THE RECRUITMENT IN- THEY- EVALUATE EMPLOYEES ESPECIALLY OF COLOR SO THANK YOU. REPORTER SOME REAL. THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON I LIKE TO ECHO MY COLLEAGUES SLOWLY THEN GOES- LATINOS ARE WE DO FACE- CERTAIN DISCRIMINATION IN THE WORKPLACE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO WAGES- I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE CORPORATIONS IN CALIFORNIA THAT ALREADY ARE VERY TRANSPARENT AS YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR OPENING IN DOING THAT IN PROVIDING DATA AND IF ONLY ALL CORPORATIONS AND COMPANIES THAT THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO. ADJUST LATE THEM. FOR THEM TO IS THE NUMBERS THAT THEY A- IT'S INCREDIBLE AND- LATINOS ARE NOW THE- HIGHEST POPULATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LET THE ENOUGH FOR PASSED THE LATINO MEN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO THEY'RE MORE LATINO WOMEN. THAT OTHER NECESSITIES AND A AND GENDER- IN THE STATE AND SO I THINK AS WE THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE THINK ABOUT. WHERE WE AS WOMEN AND I THOUGHT THE NO WOMEN SPECIFICALLY ARE ABLE TO LEAD THE STATE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF BARRIERS THAT PATHWAY AND THE JOURNEY TO ACHIEVEMENT AND THROUGH- LEACH EQUITY IS NOT THE SAME AND SO I THINK THAT YOU'VE BEEN LEADING THIS WORK SO LONG AND I AND IF POSSIBLE I I'D LOVE TO BE A CO. WELL THANK. DO YOU I'M- THE YES MA'AM MOTIONS SO IS THERE A SECOND I GET SO WE HAVE A MOTION SOME GRIOT SEC AND SUMMER US AND- I ALSO WANT TO WANT TO THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON AND YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE MADE THERE THERE REALLY WAIT MAYBE MANY DIFFERENT REASONS WHY EMPLOYEES ARE PAID A DIFFERENT RATE BUT- THREE CENTS ON THE DOLLAR. WHEN YOU CUT IT A LEGITIMATE THERE IS A ON YOU YOU YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET A WHAT PATH THERE UNLESS YOU HAVE CLEAR SYSTEMIC- ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE AN AN- FOR. WOULD YOU SHOULD ONE. TO LOOK AT THE PREMIERE SO WE ALSO WANT TO DO THAT ESPECIALLY THESE COMPANIES THAT THAT I WANT TO STRIVE TO BE BETTER. AND YOU KNOW I'M I DON'T WANT TO SEE ADDS. CELEBRATING HUNDRED YEARS OF WOMEN'S RIGHT TO VOTE OR BLACK LIVES MATTER UNLESS THEY'RE GONNA HIRE WOMEN. HIRE BLACK ENGINEERS AT THE NO ENGINEERS I'M AND CAPITAL SILICON VALLEY AND SAN JOSE. SOME OF THE MOST EGREGIOUS INCOME INEQUALITY. AS WELL AS PAY GAPS ESPECIALLY THE PLAN AS A PLACE TO WOMEN AND- AGAIN IT'S A TIME TO ACT AND SO I APPRECIATE YOU SENATE JACKSON CONTINUING. OF YOUR BOARD ACTIONS IN THIS REGARD AND CERTAINLY- I RECOMMENDATIONS SUPPORT THE BILL- AND WOULD ASK IF YOU HAVE ANY CLOSING TIME. THANK YOU AND I. THE CONCERN AND AN THE UNDER. OF WHAT WHAT THE GOAL HERE I WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY DO EVERY TWO BUT THE CHAMBER MUST TURN THEIR HEARING. OFF THIS IS NOT A LOT TO SEE. WHETHER ONE PERSON IS BEING PAID. THAN BASED UPON THEIR X. THERE. THIS IS TO LOOK AT JOB CATEGORIES. THIS IS TO LOOK AT NOT AT INDIVIDUAL COMPARISONS. BUT ON THE BASIS OF DIFFERENT CATEGORIES CHECK THE LAW PAYING CASH OUT OF RESOURCES UP. PAY CASH. IS THERE A- DIFFERENCE ARE WE SEEING. UP BY IT HERE ARE DISPARITY AND- I THINK THAT A LOT COMPANIES. AREN'T. FINISHED WHERE ARE. BUT IT'S- THAT IN BY IS HAVE I I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF WHENEVER I UP FOR YOU AT THE GOING TO THE TO THE MOVIES AT THE END OF THE FILM MY HUSBAND ALL LIKES TO SIT MORE. SCROLL DOWN TO SEE. WHAT WE CAN ALL ALL THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FAR AND SO TO Y. BUT I DO IT FOR A DIFFERENT REASON I TRY TO FIND OUT HOW MANY WOMEN FROM HAVE THEIR BEEN ON STAFF HOW MANY WOMEN GRIPS ARE THERE. MANY IN A I THE WOMEN LOCATED IN HERE'S WHERE THEY'RE LOCATED. THEY'RE LOCATED IN HERE DRESSER. AND IN. THE WARDROBE. WELL THAT'S GREAT BUT I ASSURE YOU THAT THE HIGHER PAYING JOBS ARE PRIMARILY ALL MEN AND THEY TEND TO HAVE NAMES LIKE JOHN SMITH RATHER THAN JOSE MARTINEZ AND FOR ME. THAT'S WHAT I LOOK AT. NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN WHEN MY HUSBAND WANTS TO CHIP LOOK AND SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED IN. THE MAKING OF A FILM FOR EXAMPLE THAT'S NOT THAT HE'S INTENTIONALLY BEING. BLIND TO IT IT'S JUST CITY START THINKING ABOUT IT AND I WILL ALWAYS SAY AT THE END I ONLY SAW TWO OR THREE WOMEN WORKING ON- ON ON THOSE ON THE FILM ITSELF OTHER THAN IN HER DRESSING WITH HIM. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO GO IT'S DESIGNED TO SAY FOLKS LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHO YOU'RE HIRING AND BY THE WAY. ASSEMBLYMEMBER RIVAS AYE I HOPE IT'S FIFTY THREE CENTS- TO EVERY DOCTOR BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT'S FORTY FORCE. FOR LATINO SO MAYBE THINGS ARE MOVING UP ALTHOUGH I WOULDN'T EXACTLY BOAST ABOUT IT BUT- BUT I MEAN THE NUMBERS TO REALLY HORRIFIC. AND WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL TRIES TO DO SO WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU THE SENATOR- MISSING OF CAN TAKE ROLE ON THIS WE HAVE A MOTION FROM AS A MEMBER CARILLO SECONDED. BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ. MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS KALRA. HI KALRA BY. FLORA FLORA NO. ON OKAY. CARILLO CAREER HI DEEP. GONZALEZ HI VALIS ITEM SAWYER JONES SAWYER I'VE LIVED. THREE OF US I PHIL KNIGHT BUT SO THAT BILL IS OUT AND WE'RE TWO THIRDS OF THE WAY THROUGH OUR BILLS WE HAVE THREE BILLS TO GO HUNTING OKAY JUST UP AND STRETCH OF YOU NEED TO. AND HOW. NO THAT'S ON DISK THROUGH THIS OR NOT BUT I IN SKIN. CHINA THIS TRYING TO GET US OUT OF HERE TO READ WHY OUR- AND UP NEXT SENATOR JACKSON SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE. WELL THIS IS AN EASY ONE- SAID NO OPPOSITION. OUR BUT THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT A PORTENT EFFORT THIS IS THE FAMILY LEAVE IT WAS THE BUDGET BILL AT THE TIME WE WERE- NEGOTIATING THE BUDGET IT'S PART OF THAT AGREEMENT THAT WAS REACHED BY THE GOVERNOR IN ORDER LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP THIS BILL IS. THE FIRST RECOMMENDATION TO EMERGE OUT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PAID FAMILY LEAVE TASK FORCE. THIS WAS A DIVERSE OR IS A DIVERSE GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS THAT INCLUDES REPRESENTATIVE FROM BUSINESS FROM SMALL BUSINESS FROM LABOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND VARIOUS PHILANTHROPY. IT STRENGTHENS THE IMPORTANT LAW KNOWN AS THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHT TO ACT WHICH PROVIDES THE JOB PROTECTION FOUNDATION FOR OUR STATE'S PAID FAMILY LEAVE WAGE REPLACEMENT PROGRAM. THIS BILL SEEKS TO CLOSE A CARE GIVING GAP THAT HAS CREATED AN UNCONSCIONABLE DIVIDE BETWEEN THOSE WHO CAN TAKE TIME OFF TO CARE FOR A NEWBORN OR SICK LOVE ONE AND STILL KEEP THEIR JOBS. AND THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO ACTUALLY RISK THEIR LIVELIHOOD AND ECONOMIC SECURITY FOR TAKING CARE OF THEIR FAMILY. OR BONDING WITH A NEWBORN THESE POLICIES ARE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT DURING THIS PANDEMIC WE WANT THOSE WHO ARE SICK TO STAY HOME. AND WE WANT FAMILY MEMBERS TO CARE FOR EACH OTHER TO PREVENT HOSPITALIZATIONS AND NURSING HOME REPLACEMENT SO FAR MORE THAN 40% THE COVERT TEAM FOR THE HE'S HAVE NURSED HOME RESIDENTS OR WORK. A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT SIXTEEN YEARS AGO CALIFORNIAN ACTED THE NATION'S FIRST PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM. THAT'S BOTH SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE AND SOMETHING FRANKLY TO BE A LITTLE EMBARRASSED ABOUT. THAT WE ARE THE ONLY INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRY IN THE WORLD THAT DOES NOT HAVE OR DID NOT HAVE A PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM AND THE PROGRAM THAT WE WERE ABLE TO DEVELOP AND PASSED IS ACTUALLY WORKER FUNDED. YOU AND I PAY A LITTLE BIT IN EVERY MONTH AND THAT KILL MANGAS PAYCHECK WE- THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF. INSURANCE THAT GOES INTO THIS FUND FOR PAID FAMILY LEAVE WE PAY FOR YOU WENT ONLINE. AND PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR A LARGER EMPLOYERS- ARE ABLE TO TAKE IT BUT PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR EMPLOYERS OF TWENTY FOUR LAST CAN'T TAKE. AT A NEW PARENT LEAVE AND BE ASSURED THEIR JOBS GOING TO BE THERE. AND IF YOU WORK FOR FIFTY OR LESS ARE YOU ARE KNOLL YOU WERE NOT ABLE TO TAKE THAT LEAVE OUR AND BE ASSURED THAT YOUR JOB IS THERE WHEN YOU COME BACK SO ESSENTIALLY PEOPLE PAY INTO A FUND. THEY DON'T TAKE BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID IF THEY DO TAKE IT THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE THEIR JOBS. BASICALLY THIS BILL IS TO SAY TO PEOPLE LOOK YOU CAN TAKE BELIEVE YOU PAID FOR. AND YOUR JOB WILL BE THERE TWELVE WEEKS WERE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT SIX MONTHS WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE YEAR THAT THEY DO IN MOST COUNTRIES IN EUROPE IT'S TWELVE WEEKS AND WE PAY FOR IT. AND YOU CAN'T TRUST IT BECAUSE YOU FEEL LIKE IT YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT BECAUSE OF THE FAMILY. PHONE IS MOST. TRY SO FAR. IT DOESN'T ALLOW FOR. AND THE REIMBURSEMENT YOU GET BY THE WAY ISN'T A HUNDRED CHANCE OF EVERY DOLLAR. IT'S LESS THAN MORE THAN A- MINIMUM WAGE JOB. IF YOU HAVE A MINIMUM WAGE JOB YOU CAN GET UP 270% OF YOUR WEEKLY PAYCHECK AGAIN IT'S MONEY. THAT YOU PUT INTO THE SYSTEM THAT WE'VE ALL PUT INTO THE SYSTEM. WELL THAT ISN'T ENOUGH FOR MOST PEOPLE ANYWAY SO THEY DON'T ACTUALLY TAKE THE LEAVE UNLESS THEY HAVE TO TAKE IT. IF YOU HAVE A PARENT WHO IS GOING TO THEIR FINAL ILLNESS AND YOU NEED TO TAKE THAT TIME OFF TO CARE FOR THEM. A LOT OF PEOPLE WON'T DO IT BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA LOSE THEIR JOBS OR THEY DO HERE THEY DO. AND SHOW THAT PARENT GOES WITHOUT THE CARE THAT THEY NEED OR YOU WHICH AN INDIVIDUAL MOST ACTUALLY MOST CARE- FAMILY IF IT'S TAKEN THIS TAKEN BY THE INDIVIDUAL FOR THEIR OWN CARE. VERY LITTLE IS EVEN TAKEN FOR FAMILY MEMBERS SO. THE BOTTOM LINE I'LL CUT TO THE CHASE HERE IS THAT THE OPPOSITION- YOU KNOW LIKES TO GENERATE FEAR ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO PACK THIS **** AND EVERYBODY'S GOING TO LEAVE AND NO ONE'S GOING TO GO TO WORK IN A TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE SYSTEM WE'VE GOT BUILT IN PROTECTIONS HERE. YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T QUALIFY FOR THIS DROP PROTECTION UNLESS YOU WORK FOR THE EMPLOYER FOR A YEAR AND TO BUY AND TWELVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY HOURS SO YOU DON'T TO START A JOB AND SAY I'M OFF AND BY THE WAY ARE YOU GOING TO KEEP JOBS FOR ME WHEN I GET BACK. TO WORK THAT WAY AND IF YOU CAN IMPROVE EMPLOYER THINGS THAT MAKE WASH LACKING IT REQUIRES LOCAL OF APPROVAL AND THE CONFIRMATION AND IF YOU LIKE WHAT THAT ONE DOC THERE'S YOU ACTUALLY THE RIGHT. GET A SECOND OPINION. THIS ALSO A PROCESS THAT IS ABSOLUTE. DESIGNED TO PROTECT BOTH THE WORKER AND THE EMPLOYER BUT TO RECOGNIZE THAT IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WHEN YOU HAVE TO IF YOU HAVE AN INTACT FAMILY YOU ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TEND BOTH OF THOSE- PARENTS WORKING AND YET SHOP BUT HE'S GOT TO TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER AND THEMSELVES. TIMES GET. AND WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT MOST OF THESE PEOPLE ALMOST ALL OF THEM WILL GO BACK TO THAT JOB THEY BECOME MORE EFFICIENT TO EMPLOYEES AND THEY STAY THERE MORE LOYAL EMPLOYEES. AND WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THIS BILL IS WE BROUGHT IT TO A NUMBER OF FIVE OR MORE EMPLOYEES. BECAUSE WHY SHOULD YOU NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE LEAVE BASED UPON THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES AT A BUSINESS IT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE YOUR FAMILY HEALTH YOUR HEALTH ISN'T CONTINGENT UPON WHETHER YOU WORK FOR A LARGE EMPLOYER OR NOT. AND SO- WHAT WE DID IS THE SMALL BUSINESS. OUR FOLKS AND WILL HAVE ONE OF THEM TESTIFYING TODAY THEY'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH ON THIS AND WHAT THEY'VE SHOWN IS THAT I THINK IT'S FIFTY NINE PERCENT. OF SMALL BUSINESSES OF FAR MORE SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM. BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE BUSINESSES. AND ONLY 19% OF THESE COMPANIES WILL EVEN GO OUT AND HIRE SOMEBODY ELSE DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME. REMEMBER WHEN YOU DO YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY- A LOT OF THE- BENEFITS THAT A FULL TIME. AND PERMANENT EMPLOYEE GETS SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY- LIKE A PENSION PLAN BECAUSE THESE ARE NOT THESE ARE TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES. BUT MOST COMPANIES FIND THE WHAT DO THEY DO THEY BAND TOGETHER. YOU KNOW WE'VE ALL HAD THAT I THINK- WE NOW HAVE ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES I'M SO EXCITED FOR BUFFY AS A NEW BABY. YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE PENSION AND FOR HER. AND A WE HAD THAT IN MY OFFICE HAD A ONE OF MY STAFF NOT ON. LEAVE HER FIRST HAD THE- TO BE IN THE BE OF CHOI. AND SO SHE WAS GONE FOR TO MY- KING BUT- WE IT. MY CHIEF OF STAFF ENDED UP A DAD WHO WAS. WHO SUFFERED A HEART ATTACK WHILE ON A CRUISE IN FINLAND TWO WEEKS BEFORE SESSION ENDED. AND OFF SHE WENT WE FIGURED IT OUT AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS AND THESE BECOME BETTER EMPLOYEE SO IT'S THIS IS SOMETHING IT'S TIME IS CALM. CHAMBER I THINK HAS TO COME INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY- BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE ARE AND THE WORLD HAS CHANGED THIS IS LEGISLATION THAT SIMPLY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE WORLD HAS CHANGED. BREAKING ANY GROUND HERE WHICH HAS RECOGNIZING THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DREW. IN ORDER TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO WORK- TO LIMIT ENSURE THE BUSINESSES CONTINUE TO FLOURISH THERE AS I MENTIONED ARE THE SAFEGUARDS. AND THIS IS FOR THE BETTERMENT OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA FOR THE BUSINESSES A CALIFORNIA AND HOPEFULLY WILL SERVE TO BE A LEADER IN THIS COUNTRY AS WE LOOK AT THE WORLD. OUR IN POST COLD WOULD HOPE. BY THE LATER I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR EYES. THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR SENATOR JACKSON AND WE DO HAVE OF WITNESSES AND SUPPORT YES- SHERRIN TURMAN LEGAL AID AT WORK BY PHONE AS WELL AS YAMADA. PENA WITH THIS BUSINESS JORDY ALSO BY PHONE UNTIL EACH HAVE UP TO TWO MINUTES SO- SHERRIN GERMAN YOU MAY BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. ELECTRIC CHAIR AND MEMBER SHARON TERM AND I DIRECT THE WORKING FAMILY PROGRAM THAT LEGALLY AT WORK. I'M HONORED TO TESTIFY IN STRONG SUPPORT AND I THINK THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE. LEGALLY DON'T WORK HERE'S FROM LOW WAGE WORKERS EVERY DAY WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO KEEP THEIR JOBS AND INCOME ALL CARING FOR THEIR LOVED ONES. WE HEARD FROM HEY. FATHER OF THREE AND BOTH THE CORNER OF HIS FAMILY. LIVED FIRED FROM HIS JOB AS A BOXER. WHEN HE TOOK TWO WEEKS TO CARE FOR A BABY WHO WAS BORN WITH HEALTH COMPLICATIONS. EIGHT IN THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE. BUT IS EMPLOYER COULD LEGALLY FIRE HIM BECAUSE IT WAS TOO SMALL TO BE COVERED BY OUR JOB PROTECTION LAW. HEY IS AMONG THE- AND WORK FOR. AT JOB PROTECTED BY LEAVE AND 40% EXCLUDING FROM LEAVE TO CARE FOR ONE'S OWN OR FAMILY MEMBERS OF THAT BASED ON EMPLOYERS BY THE LONG. A RECENT STUDY FOUND THAT THOSE THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY LOW WAGE WORKERS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. FIFTEEN BUT WORKERS OF COLOR WHICH- BUT I THINK HIGHER PAID BY WORKERS LEAVE WHILE BEING UNABLE ACCESS BENEFITS FOR THE BALLOT. IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC EXPANDING ACCESS TO JOB PROTECTED LEAVE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER WHEN PEOPLE LACK JOB PROTECTION. LESS LIKELY TO THINK TESTING AND MORE LIKELY TO GO TO WORK BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID OF LOSING YOUR JOB. RIGHT THE VIRUS AND MAKES TREATING IT CONTAINMENT IMPOSSIBLE. AT A TIME WHEN PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY DYING OF THE NINETEEN HEY FAMILY LEAVE CAN BE LIKE BEARING. AT LEAST IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES AND WE'VE TO REDUCE HOSPITAL AND NURSING HOME IT PLACES THAT HAVE BECOME HOT SPOT FOR INSPECTION. IMPORTANTLY THIS BILL ALSO ALIGNED THE DEFINITION OF FAMILY IN OUR JOB PROTECTION A- WITH THE MORE INCLUDES DEFINITION THAT ALREADY EXIST IN OUR PICKING ON THE LEAD LAP. THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY AND THE MANY CALIFORNIANS WHO AND WHAT THE GENERATIONAL HELPFUL. ONE OF OUR CALLERS BADLY. BUT THE SEVENTY FOUR YEAR OLD WOMAN AND LONGTIME EMPLOYEE OF A LARGE RETAIL STORE- TWIN SISTER WAS DIAGNOSED WITH TERMINAL CANCER. AS THEY BRING WEREN'T COVERED PROBABLY COULDN'T TAKE THAT LEE YOU NEED TO CARE. ALL OF THAT AT SOME IN OUR LIVES WILL NEED THE LEAVE TO CARE FOR OUR OR SOMETHING WE LOVE WHETHER YOU HAVE FIVE CO WORKERS OR FIVE HUNDRED NO ONE SHOULD BE FIRED.

FOR MORE THAN A DECADE CALIFORNIA THE PROGRAM HAS HELP LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR SMALL BUSINESSES THAT STRUGGLE TO OFFER BROKEBACK'S BENEFITS BY INSURING THEIR EMPLOYEES HAVE ACCESS TO PARTIAL WAGE REPLACEMENT WHEN THEY NEED TO CARE. HEALTH MEMBER THE BACK MAJORITY OF SMALL THIS SUPPORT PUBLICLY ADMIT. PETE LEAD. AND A WIDE BODY OF RESEARCH SHOWS THAT JOB PROTECTED LEAVE BENEFITS EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYERS ALIKE BY IMPROVING MORALE AND PRODUCTIVITY. REDUCING TURNOVER AND PROMOTING THAT THE RIGHT.

USING DATA FROM. THE ELECT THE- US CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AMONG THE FINDINGS THAT ILLUSTRATED BUT OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS THE FAMILY LEAVE RESULT IN REDUCTIONS IN LABOR COSTS FOR SMALL. EMPLOYERS WHEN EMPLOYEES YOU'VE PAID LEAVE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY PAID LEAVE THAT THEY'RE NOT. GETTING CREEK FARM EXIT RIGHT. INDEED EXPANDING JOB PROTECTIVELY CAN LOWER COSTS BY REDUCING TURNOVER AND IT IS ESTIMATED THAT IT CAUGHT UP TO ONE THIRD OF AN EMPLOYEE'S SALARY TO REPLACE THEM. ACCORDING TO A POLL RELEASED THIS SPRING NEARLY SIX AND TEN SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS A FIFTY NINE PERCENT. CALIFORNIA'S SUPPORT EXPANDING DOC PROTECTED PARENTAL LEAVE AND 54% OF THE- TICKET AT THE AT THE WORK THE WORK IN THE- WICKS.

AND NOW WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE OKAY THANK YOU SO OVER HERE BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. EMOTIONS AS A MEMBER CARILLO- BUT SURE FLOOR. THANK YOU CHAIR SENATOR. YEAH THERE'S A THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS THAT THAT ROB REALLY CONCERNING AND WE'VE HAD A FEW BILLS TODAY AND YOUR BY QUALITY HAVE SPOKE ABOUT. THEIR EXPERIENCE ON WHY THOSE BILLS WHY THESE BILLS ARE IMPORTANT TO THEM. AND SIMON SPEAK FOR JUST A FEW MOMENTS ON MY EXPERIENCE- WITH THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY. I FAMILY'S BEEN IN BUSINESS IT'S SOME ASPECT IN OUR CULTURE FOR. MANY YEARS. AND WHEN YOU START A BUSINESS. YOU DON'T START WITH ONE OR TWO THREE EMPLOYEES ESPECIALLY WHERE IN OUR CULTURE YOU START WITH FIVE TO TEN SOMEWHERE RIGHT IN THERE BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE TRYING THERE'S GROUND THAT YOU HAVE TO COVER THERE'S THINGS THAT HAVE TO BE REPAIRED. AND IF WE START DOING THIS WE START HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY. AND UNDERSTANDING THAT. YEAH IF SOMEBODY GOES OUT ON FAMILY LEAVE THAT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND I WOULD SAY THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY. OF BUSINESSES ALLOW FOR THAT. I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT THOSE STAY IN PLACE. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO. BUT WHEN WE HAVE THIS CONVERSATION THAT WE HAVE TO EXPAND THIS. WE HAVE GIVE THEM. FOR WEEKS LEAVE. IT IN THE IT'S IN THE- WELL IT'S IN THE TWELVE SET UP TO TWENTY FOUR WEEKS OF ANNUALLY. SO MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING I'M MISREADING BUT THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS HERE. THE WHEN WE HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AND WE'RE STEP IN THERE. THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE PROTECT. THE EMPLOYEES WHEN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY SHUTS THEIR DOORS. AFTER CO THAT ONE IN THREE WILL NOT REOPEN IN THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMITTEE WHEN THE REST OF THE BUSINESS ME SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT WE CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE WE CAN'T AFFORD TO HIRE MORE PEOPLE. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE THAT MANY PEOPLE OFF AT ONE TIME. IT'S NO LONGER WORTH IT. NOW WHAT WE HAVE WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE UNEMPLOYED. AND I FIND A FAST NEED TO SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY WHO HAS SPOKE IN SUPPORT OF THIS- SAYS THAT THEY REPRESENT OVER YOU'LL FOUR MILLION BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA. BUT THEY HAVE NO MEMBERSHIP. I THAT'S FASCINATING TO ME BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU CAN REPRESENT SOMEBODY. IF YOU HAVE NO MEMBERSHIP. SO WHEN YOU SAID ON THE GOVERNOR'S TASK FORCE YOU HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS LIKE. THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY THAT IS IN OPPOSITION THOSE RE THE ONES THAT ACTUALLY PLOY PEOPLE. THEY'RE NOT JUST A SHELL COMPANY. THEY'RE NOT JUST A CHAU ORGANIZATION THAT YOU CAN HIDE BEHIND AND SAY WE REPRESENT THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY WHEN YOU ABSOLUTELY DO NOT. THE ONLY CHAMBER. IS IN OPPOSITION TO THIS. AND THERE WAS STUDIES THAT WERE PUT OUT IN THE BAY AREA COUNCIL. A STUDY AND I WOULD LOVE- AND I AM IN ASKS FOR THE BUSINESS THREE TO RESPOND TO THIS. BUT I LOVE BECAUSE ANY STUDY. THAT SAYS THAT THIS IS BENEFICIAL TO THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY. IS FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG YOU MAY LIKE IT YOU WE MAY ALL BE ABLE TO AGREE THAT PAID FAMILY LEAVE IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND I BELIEVE THAT AS WELL. BUT THE FUNDAMENTAL FLAW IS TO SAY THAT THIS IS GOOD. FOR THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY. IS WRONG. IT'S FACTUALLY INACCURATE IN FOR SOME OF THESE FOLKS TO COME IN SUPPORT POUNDING THEIR DROP ABOUT HOW THEY'RE REPRESENTING THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IS QUITE FRANKLY IRRITATING. BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU MAIN STREET AMERICA. IS GETTING DEVASTATED. NONE OF THESE PEOPLE THAT WERE IN SUPPORT COME FROM THE ROLE COMMUNITIES. NONE OF A AND THAT TOO IS GOING TO GET JUST HAMMERED WHEN YOU DRIVE. DOWN MAIN STREET MY DISTRICT EVERYTHING'S BOARD UP. DOES IT ARE BOARDED UP ON THE RAGGED EDGE. THEY WERE WITHIN DAYS OR WEEKS OF NEVER RE OPENING THEIR DOORS AGAIN. AND SO THIS KIND OF BILL THOUGH IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT WE PROTECT FAMILY LEAVE AND I CAN SUPPORT THAT. I THINK THE OVERWHELMING SCOPE OF THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION- IS PARTICULARLY- QUITE FRANKLY REGIS AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL DO. IRREVERSIBLE HARM TO THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY BECAUSE WHEN NOBODY OPENS OUR DOORS AGAIN BECAUSE THEY CAN'T DEAL WITH ALL OF THE NEW REGULATIONS THAT WE AS A BUILDING PUT ON TOP IT'S NOT JUST ONE OR THE OTHER IT'S NOT LIKE THIS IS THE ONLY BUILD WE'VE DONE THIS YEAR THAT AFFECTS THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY. AND WE MAY ALL OF THEM IN THE TYLER. STACK THEM ONTOP OF EACH OTHER. AND WE SAY NEXT YEAR THE BUSINESS THREE IS GONNA HAVE TO ALL OF THESE THINGS. PEOPLE ARE GONNA SAY WE CAN'T DO THAT. AND THEY'RE GONNA SHUT THE DOORS IN THE REST OF THE EMPLOYEES ARE GOING TO BE OUT OF A JOB. SO I WOULD ACTUALLY I DO WANT THEM THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WHOEVER WANTS TO QUEUE UP. TO RESPOND TO THAT BAY AREA COUNCIL STUDY BECAUSE I THINK THEY WILL HAVE A VERY UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE ON THAT PARTICULAR STUDY. THROUGH THE CHAIR PLEASE SURE- THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR IS A- JENNIFER PEREIRA ONLINE OR ANYONE ELSE- JENNIFER BERKEY HANSON WHO ARE THE TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES. AT AROUND HERE THIS IS JENNIFER OKAY GOOD GO AHEAD JENNIFER IF YOU WANT TO OF ANSWER THE QUESTION. THE VICE CHAIR. YEAH THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR AT THE DAIRY COUNCIL STUDY- AND THEY WOULD BRIEFLY BUT THE MENTION LOOK AT THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM WHICH IS NOT WHAT THE BILL'S ABOUT THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM TO THE WEIGHT REPLACEMENT PROGRAM. THAT PRIOR TO JULY THIRD PROVIDED SIX WEEKS OF WEIGHT REPLACEMENT NOW IT PROVIDES EIGHT WEEKS OF WEIGHT REPLACEMENT- IT IS NOT. A MANDATORY LEAVE WITH A THREAT AT PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IF YOU DO ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT IT IS A OPPORTUNITY WHEN AN EMPLOYER PROVIDES HIGH MARKS FOR AN EMPLOYEE TO GET WAGE REPLACEMENT BENEFITS FOR THE BAY AREA COUNCIL LOOK AT THE KEY TO FAMILY. PROGRAM IN IN HEARING AFTER THE ORANGES HERE. AND YEAH SAID YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN THAT. THIS IF YOU WERE ABLE GET THAT. OFF DIDN'T HAPPEN IT VICTOR EXCEPT FOR REFERENCE TO AND IF I EAT THAT IN THAT THEY MAY. THE IF I'D BE STUDY I THINK THE COP AT THE MINT COURT STANDING. HEATHROW OR- WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME THING. THAT THERE COULD BE COCKED TO A SMALL BUSINESS. HERE AT THE MALL. THE REPRESENTATIVE MAY. COST BUT AGAIN THE BAY AREA COUNCIL WAS NOT LOOKING AT THE CORRECT VAN IN WHICH- THE- PUBLIC TO DO. THANK YOU MUCH THANK YOU THANK GOODNESS FOR SURE A SUMMER CARILLO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I UNDERSTAND THE GOAL OF THE BILL SENATOR JACKSON'S- MANY MANY YEARS AGO- WHEN I DID NOT HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE THE STATE I HAD A REGULAR JOB NINE FIVE IN OFFICE MY GRANDMOTHER GOT WELL AND I DID NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE FAMILY LEAVE BECAUSE A GRANDPARENT WASN'T A PART OF THE LANGUAGE IN WHICH I COULD TAKE LEAVE AND KNOW THAT I WAS GOING TO COME BACK. AND HAVE JOB SO- TAKING EXUM CATION TIME AND THINGS LIKE THAT TO BE ABLE TO BUY THE THEM ON WHETHER NEAT. THOUGHT HE- SUN SUPPORT THE IDEA SPENDING. OUT FAMILY IS BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF FAMILIES THE NUCLEAR FAMILY IS NOT THE SAME ANYMORE IF IT WAS ONCE DESCRIBED BUT- AND EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO CARE FOR THEIR FAMILY MEMBER ESPECIALLY. DURING THIS TIME I- HAVE DIVED A LITTLE BIT DEEPER INTO OUT WHAT TRADITIONALLY IS NOT MY SCHOOL AND THAT IS THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY ONE BECAUSE I HOPE UNDERSTAND A BETTER BECAUSE I REPRESENT A DISK THAT IS TWENTY PERCENT. THE NATIONAL POVERTY LINE AND A WAY TO GET OUT OF POVERTY IS TO HAVE A GOOD JOB- AND HOPEFULLY GOOD WAGES AND COLLECTIONS WILL BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT. I WAS CARRYING A BIT. A BIT THIRTY THREE THIRTY SIX AS A FOOD SAFETY DELIVERY BILL THAT SIMPLY WOULD HAVE. MADE IT THAT- ANY RESTAURANT THAT HAS OR USES A SERVICE FOR DELIVERY. HAS THE UP TO DATE. CLOSE DOES THE THANKS. AND IF YOU'RE USING A THIRD APPS LIKE AT YOUR FOOD DELIVER THEY TO YOUR FOOD IS NOT TAMPER. I BRING THAT AYE AYE CHAU THAT WITH THE BECAUSE ONE THAT IS MAIN. ON THE THINK SHOULD MOVE FORWARD BUT I WAS ABLE TO REALLY GET MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE SMALL RESTAURANTS IN MY COMMUNITY- MOST OF WHOM ARE SEVERELY IMPACTED BY CALL OF IT. MOST OF THEM ARE OWNED BY A THEIR SMALL MOM AND POP RESTAURANT CREDIBLE FOOD AND ASSEMBLY DISTRICT FIFTY ONE- BUT CLOSE TO SEVEN THOUSAND SMALL RESTAURANTS AND MY DISTRICT THE MAJORITY OF HIM EIGHTY PERCENT. EMPLOYEE LET THE NINE PEOPLE. I'M AND I'M THINKING ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHTS ACT- IN COMPARISON TO. PAID FAMILY LEAVE PAID FAMILY LEAVE DOESN'T HAVE THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. AS THE US THE FRONT US AND SO WHAT I WOULD WANT TO AVOID IN MY COMMUNITY AND REALLY ACROSS THE STATE IS FOR THE SMALL MOM AND POP SHOPS TO BE UNDER UNNECESSARY LITIGATION. BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A HUGE HUMAN RESOURCE DEPARTMENT. IT'S A FAMILY MEMBER THIS TAKING CARE OF THE DAY TO DAY PAYROLL THEY'RE TAKING CARE OF THE NECESSITIES OF THE RESTAURANT- SO I GUESS MY QUESTION TO YOU IS IF YOUR GOAL IS TO ALIGN. AND TO EXPAND AND PROVIDE MORE RESOURCES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THEIR JOBS WOULD YOU CONSIDER. TAKING AN AMENDMENT THAT REMOVES A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION TO THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION YEAH YOU KNOW TIS THIS WHOLE NOTION ABOUT A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION CREATES TERRIBLE PROBLEMS FOR EVERYONE IS JUST NOT ACCURATE. IT IS THIS BILL WILL BE- INCLUDE IT WILL BE WITHIN AN EXISTING FRAMEWORK WE DON'T SEE THESE LAWSUITS THE WAY THE CHAMBER TRIES TO BRING IN FACT WE HEARD THE SAME THING THREE YEARS. WE DID THE BILL ON PARENT LEAF THEY'RE GOING TO BE THE- DOES TO ALLOW A PER. RIGHT OF ACTION. THE RIGHT OF ACTION- CAN ONLY OCCUR AFTER ALL REMEDIES ARE EXHAUSTED AND IF AN EMPLOYER HAS- IT'D VERDANT LEE DENIED SOMEONE THAT RIGHT TO TAKE THE LEAVE IF THEY TAKE THE EMPLOYEE BACK THERE'S NO LAWSUIT THERE'S NO DAMAGES SO BASICALLY. TO PROVIDE THEM THE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THIS ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS WHEN THE SMALL BUSINESS PERSON CAN BE ADVISED THAT THE LAW GIVES THAT EMPLOYEE THE RIGHT TO TAKE THE LEAVE IF THEY ARE SICK THEMSELVES. AND REMEMBER. WHAT WE'RE HEARING NOW IS I THINK THE SUGGESTION IS THAT BUSINESSES ARE GOING UNDER NOT BECAUSE A COVERT BUT BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE ARE TAKE LEAVE THAT THAT ISN'T IT IN FACT IF I'M AN EMPLOYEE AND I HAVE COLD BUT I BETTER GET THE HECK OUT OF THERE WORKPLACE BECAUSE I'M GOING TO AFFECT EVERYBODY ELSE. I WANT A MODEL THAT WORKPLACE PEOPLE LARGEST LEAVING THEIR WORK PLACES IN DROVES BECAUSE OF COLD. THE RESTAURANT CHARGE SUFFERING BECAUSE EMPLOYEES ARE WORKING. PEOPLE THAT RESTAURANTS ARE SUFFERING BECAUSE PEOPLE AREN'T GOING OUT AND BECAUSE I CAN'T WORK THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO BE ABLE TO GO TO THE RESTAURANT. AND HAVE DINNERS OUT. I MEAN IT THAT'S NOT THE CARS HERE AND I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT LEAST LET'S LET'S REVERSE THAT LENDS A LITTLE BACK. AND LOOK AT THE FACT. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK. SHOULD NOT BE AT WORK BUT YOU KNOW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PEOPLE HAVE ONLY BY LAW THREE PAID SICK DAYS A YEAR. SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IS. THAT PEOPLE ARE TAKING THEIR NOT LEAVING WORK THEY'RE NOT GETTING TESTED IF THEY'RE ILL THEY'RE NOT DOING WHAT THEY SHOULD DO TO PROTECT THE REST OF US BECAUSE THEY NEED THAT JOB. THEY'RE GOING TO GO TO WORK EVEN IF THEY'RE SICK. SO WHAT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS ENCOURAGE PEOPLE. WHEN THEY ARE SICK OR WHEN YOUR GRANDMOTHER IS CHICKEN YES YOU CAN'T JUST TAKE THE LEAF YOU CAN BE REQUIRED TO USE UP TIME THAT YOU'VE MADE HAD AVAILABLE TO YOU. AT CHECK FOR. IT BASICALLY CHURCH SAYS. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET PAID AND I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT YOU'RE NOT BEING PAID. SO THE EMPLOYER CAN BRING IN TEMPORARY HELP. DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME BUT THAT ACTUALLY ONLY HAPPENS IN THE SMALL BUSINESSES. 19% OF THE TIME. WHAT HAPPENS IS EVERYBODY WORKS TOGETHER. THE NOTION THAT SUDDENLY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ALL THIS LITIGATION IS THE CONSTANT CLAIM THAT THE CHAMBER MAKES IT'S NEVER. BEEN PROVEN CORRECT. WE HAD TO- I THINK WITH NEW PARENT LEAVE WE HAD AVAILABLE TO US. TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE NOW HAVE THE RIGHT TO TAKE THAT LEAVE. THE TOTAL AFTER THE FIRST YEAR WHEN COMPANIES WERE ARGUABLY JUST LEARNING ABOUT IT THERE WERE SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY RIGHT TO TWO LETTERS. THERE WERE ISSUED OUT OF TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE ABLE TO ACCESS THAT LAW. SIX SIX HUNDRED TWENTY RIGHT TO OTHERS NOW THAT THERE IS NO WAY SIX HUNDRED TWENTY PEOPLE FILE LAWSUITS. WELL DON'T SUE FOR THIS THEY WANT THEIR JOBS. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SO IT IS I THINK IMPORTANT THAT AT SOME POINT IN TIME WE ALIGN ALL THIS. SO WE DON'T HAVE THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHT CHECK THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE ACT AND THEN THE ABILITY TO HAVE JOB PROTECTION. THEY SHOULD ALL BE IN ONE SYSTEM THIS MEASURE TRIES TO START MAKING THAT ALIGNMENT. THE PEOPLE WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE SHOULD GET SHOWING IN BEING SUED WE'VE GOT TO HAVE GREATER CLARITY ON WHAT THE LAW IS THAT PART OF WHAT THIS BILL THE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT- I SLIGHTLY DISAGREE WITH. YOU IN TERMS OF- YOUR STATEMENT THAT COLD IT IS NOT THE REASON WHY RESTAURANTS ARE NOT ONLY THE REASON MARK IT IS THE REASON WHY THE. STRUCTURE MUCH TO. IN THIS BOOK IT'S THAT THEY'RE AND- ARE WORKING. WHILE WORKING AS A OF IT WE HAVE SHUT DOWN OF COURSE SO THAT OBVIOUSLY IMPACTING RESTAURANTS THE DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE PATIO DINING RIGHT ALREADY THE ONLY OPTION IS REALLY TAKE OUT DELIVERY YEAH LISTEN I'M A BIG. DATA PERSON SO I'M BUT I'M TO USE IT AT ALL BUT BUT THE POINT IS THAT IT'S NOT BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT TO WORK. THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU KNOW. PEOPLE WANT TO WORK AND THEY'RE DESPERATE TO WORK AND THEY DON'T WORK THEY DON'T GET PAID AND THEN THEY DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY AND THEN THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT BEING EVICTED I MEAN. THAT THIS THIS BILL IS NOT THE PROBLEM. ARE AT AN AYE I THINK WE HAVE TO. REALIZE THAT SMALL BUSINESSES IN FACT. WHEN YOU'RE IN A SMALL BUSINESS I CAN TELL YOU ACT LIKE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FLOOR AYE I HAD A SMALL BUSINESS. AND I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO WORK REALLY HARD. BUT BUT- YOUR EMPLOYEES IN A SMALL BUSINESS REALLY YOUR FAMILY. THEY SPEND MORE TIME WITH THEM PROBABLY THEN YOU DO YOUR OWN FAMILY AND YOU'RE RIGHT PEOPLE SHOULD BE MAKING THIS AVAILABLE. BUT IN THOSE INSTANCES WHEN THEY DON'T OR THEY WON'T. THIS BILL CHOSE GIVES PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CARE FOR A LOVED ONE. UHHUH IT GIVES SOME DOCTOR BOND WITH A NEWBORN. IT GIVES AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE HER CELLS WHEN THEY'RE SICK. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES THIS BILL ISN'T. AN ATTEMPT TO RIP OFF AN EMPLOYER. THIS IS A BILL THAT SAYS. AS I CAN BEING I HAVE. THESE NEEDS. AND I TRUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEM. WITHOUT COST YOU A PENNY IN TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT YOU MAY NEED TO GO OUT SHOP. BUT TO DO THAT AND I WILL TELL. THAT IT VERY. THAT WAY COMPANIES FOR THIS SHOULD THE- AT THE TIME FOR THE FOR PEOPLE TO WHAT THEY NEED DO IS FROM BEINGS THEY SAVE MONEY SAY DON'T. TRY TO TAKE OVER JOB THEY COME TOGETHER YOU KNOW COMPANIES ONE OF THE THINGS ARE WHICH WERE A LITTLE BIT MORE POSITIVE ABOUT SMALL BUSINESS SMALL BUSINESSES A REALLY VERSATILE WE GET OUT A SMALL BUSINESSES TAXABLE IF SOMEBODY NEEDS TO TAKE ON A JOB THAT JOE WAS DOING BUT CHOSE BEEN OUT SICK- OR WAS IN A CAR ACCIDENT BUT- FELL OFF HISBIKE OR SOMETHING. BUT HE STEPS IN WE BACK TO THAT FIRST PEOPLE BUT WE GIVE CHAU THAT TIME TO KEEP. YOU SAY. WE SEE SOMEBODY WHO'S GOING TO CANCER TO FOR A- I'M SORRY BUT YOU HAVE TO BACK TO WORK BUT YOU CAN'T TAKE CARE YOURSELF OR YOU CAN'T TAKE THE TIME YOU NEED IF YOU'RE GOING THROUGH CHEMOTHERAPY. YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN THERE AND I'LL TELL YOU NOT VERY FUNCTIONAL FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AFTER THAT HAPPENS YOU NEED THAT TIME TO REST YOU NEED THAT TIME TO HEAL. TO NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE TO MAKE THAT HOBSON'S CHOICE DO I GO TO WORK. OUR OR DO I STAY HOME AND TAKE CARE OF MYSELF BECAUSE IF I STAY HOME AND CARE OF. TAKE CARE OF MYSELF I'M GONNA LOSE MY JOB. BUT YOUR PEOPLE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO MAKE THAT CHOICE. COMPLETELY AGREE- MY CONCERN IS. FOR THAT SMALL MOM AND POP RESTAURANT MY DISTRICT THAT'S RUN BY AN IMMIGRANT FAMILY WHO'S TRYING TO MAKE ENDS MEET. WE CAN PROVIDE ALL OF THE NECESSARY RESOURCES TO THE EMPLOYEE. BUT THERE AREN'T AS MANY RESOURCES FOR THE OWNERS OF THAT SMALL REST. TO HAVE. SOME IT KIND OF THAT OUT OUR STATE IS THERE AREN'T THAT MANY LAWSUIT BECAUSE PEOPLE AREN'T FILING LAWSUITS THEN WHY NOT REMOVE THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BUT LET ME ALSO FINISHED ON THE CONTRARY IT'S ALSO IF WE DON'T HAVE THE PRIVATE LAW THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THEN HOW DO WE ENFORCE THE LAW I I'D LIKE SHE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM BOTH SIDES OF POSSIBLE MISTER CHAIR NOT THAT I WANT TO LAY THE- THE COMPANY ANY FURTHER I DO THINK IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BILL. THAT NEEDS A LITTLE BIT MORE DISCUSSION AND I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU ARE OPEN TO THAT BECAUSE I'M LOOKING AT IT ALL THE SMALL PRESS IN MY COMMUNITY THAT ARE DOWN. THEY'RE JUST IN. LIKE ALLOW OF SUFFERING LIKE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER FLORA SAID AND I'M LOOKING AT THREE ONE PERSPECTIVE AND I'M SURE THERE ARE MANY OTHER PERSPECTIVES ACROSS THE STATE. IN TERMS OF HOW DO WE BOTH. HELP THE EMPLOYEE WHICH IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BASED ON. THE EXAMPLE THAT I GAVE YOU ARE BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE AS A YOUNGER. AND HOW. MAY I HELP. THIS OF. AND NOT HAVE TO SHUT DOWN AND NOT HAVE TO FEAR. LYTIC SO IF POSSIBLE I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM ALL STATES BUT- OKAY. WE HAVE A YEAH I DON'T KNOW SHARON TERMINAL DELAYED WORK. ORIGIN OF REP FROM CAL CHAMBER ON THAT POINT REGARDING PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. IF EITHER OF YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO EITHER SIDE OF THAT WOULD THIS BE FOR JANET JENNIFER STATE OF STANDARD OF THE MY FIRST WITH IF. MAKE MAY BE THE BEST PERSON TO ANSWER THIS. IN THIS ONE WE HAD SHARON TERM INSURANCE YEAH SURE INTERNAL LEGALLY DON'T WORK. YES SO I DON'T KNOW SHARON'S ONLINE. YEAH I'M HERE I'M HAPPY TO SPEAK TO THAT POINT UNLESS. YES SO AS AND SENATOR JACKSON'S BINGE AND ON THIS BILL DOES NOT ADD A NEW PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THIS IS THE WELL ESTABLISHED ENFORCEMENT SCHEME THAT IN PART. I MEAN HELPING OUT WHICH IS ALREADY TO EMPLOYERS WITH FIVE OR MORE EMPLOYEES. FOR DECADES AND IT'S THE SAME ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM THAT ALREADY EXIST UNDER THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHT BACK. AND IF THIS IMPORTANT HE REQUIRES EMPLOYEES TO BOX REMEDY IS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING. OR THEY FIND A LOT. AGENCY OUR FIRST WE NEED. AND TOOK BOTH PARTIES IT CHARGE WITHIN THAT CLAIM AND ON THE POINT OF THIS YOU KNOW THE LAW IT YOU DO NEED TO HAVE A PRIVATE RIGHT ACTION ARE A BACK THOUGHT IN ORDER TO HAVE THE MEANINGFUL ENFORCEMENT BUT- I CONSIDER JACKSON MENTIONED BUT THE LOW WAGE WORKERS BUT WE WORK WELL THAT WE HEARD FROM EVERY DAY. THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED IN A LOT BUT THEY WANTED TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES AND THEIR HEALTH AND THE HEALTH OF THEIR FAMILIES AND. THEY WANT TO KEEP THEIR- WITH THIS IS ABOUT IT'S ABOUT ALLOW WORKERS TO CHARACTER. WITHOUT HAVING TO FACT. THEIR ACT THE- AND WE READ. THAT CHALLENGES THAT BUSINESSES ARE FACING RIGHT NOW BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO KNOW THE BUSINESSES ARE COMPRISE OF HUMAN BEINGS WHO GET. AND HAVE CHILDREN I NEED TO CARE FOR ELEVEN ONES AND YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SACRIFICE THEIR ECONOMIC SECURITY. AND OUR LIVELIHOOD TO DO SO. AND WE NEED GOES HAND IN HAND WITH DOCTOR JACKSON BENNY'S HAVE SHOWN TIME AND TIME AGAIN THAT WITHOUT THE JOB PROTECTION. WORK PARTICULAR LOW WAGE WORKERS IMMIGRANT WERE AND WORKERS OF AMERICA. DO NOT BELIEVE AND ASSEMBLY THEY'RE PAYING FOR OUT OF EVERY PAYCHECK THEY ARE PAYING FOR THESE BENEFITS. THEY CANNOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE BENEFITS THAT THEY HAVE EARNED. IF THEY DON'T HAVE. AT THAT THE INSURANCE THE INSURANCE THAT THEIR JOB WILL BE WAITING FOR THEM WHEN THEY COME BACK. FROM TAKING THE EXTENSION LEAD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR A NUMBER JENNIFER JENNIFER GOING AHEAD ONE IN A- YEAH THANK YOU- SO A COUPLE OF POINTS IN RESPONSE TO THAT- BUT WAS JUST THAT THEY ARE THERE THE SUGGESTION IS THAT WITH THE PART OF AN EXISTING FRAMEWORK WITHIN THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT. AND THAT IS TRUE BUT IT IS NOT AN EXISTING REPO MANDATE ON SMALL EMPLOYERS SO THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT DOESN'T CONTAIN A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BUT WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS EXPANDING A TWELVE WEEK MANDATORY LEAVE OF ABSENCE ON FROM PLAYERS WHO HAVE NEVER IMPLEMENTED BEFORE. AND AGAIN THERE FORTY PAGES OF REGULATIONS ON HOW TO IMPLEMENT THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHT BACK SO IT IS A NEW BEAT FOR THOSE EMPLOYERS WHO HAVE NEVER DEALT WITH IT AND IT IS A NEW PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THAT THEY'VE NEVER HAD TO DEAL WITH. ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDY. FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOW THEY- WHAT DID YOU HAVE TO GO OUT. MANY RECORD YOU CAN LITERALLY. ON HE DID THE AT THE AGE WEBSITE. THE LATTER COMPLAINT AND REQUEST AN IMMEDIATE RIGHT WITH YOU. AND THAT GIVES YOU THE TICKET BASICALLY TO GO STRAIGHT TO DOUBLE COURT. DOING THAT ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS TAKES APPROXIMATELY ONE MINUTE THE COMPLETE IT IS NOT A NET THIRTY TERMS OR AT KIND INTENSIVE REQUIREMENT IT TAKE THE COCKNEY ONE MINUTE. ONCE YOU HAVE THAT IMMEDIATE RIGHT. YOU THERE IS NO FURTHER EIGHT INVESTIGATION THERE IS NO FURTHER MEDIATION AND AT THAT RECORDED EARLIER. THE DATA SHOWS. THAT OUT OF ALL THE COMPLAINTS FILED OVER HALF. OF THE COMPLAINT WITH THE AT THE AGE. THE CURTAIN REQUEST AN IMMEDIATE RIGHT THAT. LITIGATION BUT THE MEDIATION PROGRAM THAT WOULD THREATEN. NEVER UTILIZED IF YOU REQUEST THAT IMMEDIATE RIGHT WITH YOU THE THREE TO COURT. THE OTHER- COMMENT THAT WAS MADE. IS THAT. THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT CAPTION WITHOUT LITIGATION. JUST THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE I MEAN THAT. THE POINT IS THAT YOU CAN AND THE THAT. THEIR JOB. IMPORTANT THING THAT EMPLOYER WILL NOT FOLLOW THE LAW AND WHAT YOUR THREATEN THE A LOT AND I'M SURE. I CAN COME UP NOT OFF THE TOP MY HEAD RIGHT NOW. BUT WITH A TON OF UP. A COULDN'T SECTIONS AND LOTS THAT DON'T HAVE A RIGHT ACTION AND THE LESS WE HAVE. LEGAL COMPLY BY THE END CAN BE BECAUSE THEY FOLLOW WITH A LOT. WHAT WE DON'T NEED AT THE- BUT IT. EVERYTHING WILL KIND OF THE STATE IS MADE AND IT IS NOT ACCURATE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT. OF THE EMPLOYEES RETURN TO WORK THAT'S NOT THE BASIS FOR THE LOT. THE LOCKET IS WHETHER OR NOT YOU WANT IT IF YOU AT. NIGHT IN A RAPID DISCOURAGED OR INTERFERED WITH THE RIGHT TO TAKE THE LEAD AND NOT THAT THE FIGHT THE LACKEY THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH WHETHER OR NOT YOU BRING THE EMPLOYEE BACK. THE OTHER POINT WAS THAT LOW WAGE WORKERS ARE INTERESTING ALLEGATIONS AND WHY DO YOU NEED A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. IF LOW WAGE WORKERS ARE NOT GOING TO GO FILE A LOT. THE AGENT. YOU HAVE TO. AT FOR THE LOW WHICH WERE MAKING GO TO THE OF EMPLOYMENT IN THE AGENCY CHARGED IMPORTING THAT CAN HELP THEM IF THEY NEED TO GO THROUGH THE- AND THEY CAN FILE PROTECT THE EMPLOYEE THERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IN ORDER TO HAVE DROPPED PROTECTION. OKAY THANK YOU. ANY OTHER PAUL QUESTION COMMA THE SOME. ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBER WELL YES ACTUALLY YES. I JUST TO AGAIN JUST TO CLARIFY SENATOR JACKSON THIS WILL TAKE IT. IF WE CONTINUE HAVING THE CONVERSATION WHICH I'M SURE YOU'RE VERY OPEN TO. THIS IS NOW CHANGING IT SO THAT IT'S SOME. FROM FIFTY EMPLOYEES TWO FIVE EMPLOYEES WHICH IS WHERE THE SMALL BUSINESSES COME INTO PLAY WHICH IS MY BIGGEST CONCERN WHICH I'M SURE AND WHICH IS WHAT MR FLORA HAS ALSO EXPRESSED THIS ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS. I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO GET TO WHERE YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE ON THIS BILL- AND- THIS IS NOT A OF POSITION THAT I OFTEN FIND MYSELF AND BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN AGREE WITH A LOT OF THE ADVOCATES FOR SUPPORTING. THIS BILL. MY CONCERN IS THAT. THE SMALL BUSINESSES ALSO EMPLOY THE VERY PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY AND IF WE- AT THE CONTINUED REGULATIONS ON SMALL BUSINESSES JUST MAKE IT HARDER FOR PEOPLE TO GET JOBS. EVEN THOUGH I UNDERSTAND. I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT THE GOAL OF WHAT IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE ESPECIALLY. IN EXPANDING THE DEFINITION OF FAMILY ACROSS THE STATE. I'M JUST I'M HOPING THAT YOU'LL- TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT HAS BEEN SAID. IN TERMS OF. THE STRESSES AND LACK OF RESOURCES TOWARD SMALL BUSINESSES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN IN THIS POSITION BEFORE. I'M GOING T HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH A SMALL BUSINESS COUNCIL MOST OF WHOM ARE RESTAURANTS IN MY COMMUNITY AND THEY'RE GOING TO ASK ME WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO PROTECT US. AND I'M NOT SURE I HAVE THAT ANSWER. WELL I DON'T THINK THIS IS AN EITHER OR I DON'T THINK THIS IS A ISSUE OF NOT PROTECTING BUSINESSES WE'VE HAD THE- PREGNANCY DISABILITY LAW IN EFFECT FOR. MANY MANY YEARS AND IT ARE ALL CALLS FOR AN EMPLOYER OF FIVE OR MORE TO PROVIDE THAT PREGNANCY DISABILITY LEAVE SO THIS ISN'T REALLY A STARTING NEW WHAT THIS IS DOING IS THE SAME WAY WE ARE WITH EXPANDING DEFINITION FAMILY. CREATING WITHIN AN EXISTING FRAMEWORK SOME OF THE ADDITIONAL CRITERIA WHICH WE NEED TO REFLECT THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY IT WITH IN WHICH WE LIVE YOU MENTION INTERGENERATIONAL ALIKI YOU WERE CARE GIVER. OF YOUR GRANDMOTHER. WITH THE SECOND LARGEST INTERGENERATIONAL STATE. IN THE COUNTRY AND YET THE DEFINITIONS THAT WE USE DON'T REFLECT THE FACT THAT WE CARE FOR GRAND KIDS AND HOPEFULLY OUR GRAND KIDS OF CARE FOR US WHEN WE'RE IN OUR DOTAGE- AND THAT'S WHAT CALIFORNIA IS. SO I THINK THE FACT THAT THAT THAT THIS IS NOT A WHOLE NEW SYSTEM WERE CREATING. WE'VE DONE THIS WITH OUR PREGNANCY DISABILITY- AND THE YOU KNOW THE WHOLE ISSUE OF THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IS KIND OF LIKE A- A RED FLAG THAT GETS THE FLOWN. BECAUSE I THINK BUSINESSES. IF YOU KNOW THEY THEY THEY DON'T LIKE THE NOTION THAT THEY COULD BE SUED IF THEY DO NOT DO WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED. THIS IS PART OF AN AND- MECHANISM AND I HAVE ALL THE RESPECT IN THE WORLD FROM HIS BARRERA WE HAVE WORKED TOGETHER AND WE'VE BEEN ADVERSARIES FOR QUITE SOME TIME AS WELL. THE FACT IS THAT YOU HAVE TO GO TO DE FE H. YOU HAVE TO GO AND YOU HAVE TO. WHAT DO YOU IMMEDIATELY CHICA OR RIGHT TO SHOW ORDER. THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU YOU ARE GOING TO SHOOT. BECAUSE IN ORDER LAWSUITS REQUIRE THAT YOU HAVE DAMAGES THERE ARE SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE. THAT ALLOW EMPLOYERS TO RECOVER FEES AND COSTS. IF SOMEONE FILES A FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT ON. AND YOU KNOW YOU TALK ABOUT THE PEOPLE IN YOUR COMMUNITY. I'M YOUR PEOPLE THAT'S WHAT CHAU AND THEY WERE GET PAID FAIR. AND THEY WANT THE WORKING CONDITION TO BE TECH OF THEM. AND THEY WERE. PART OF WORKING FACE. THE JUDGE TO THAT MOST OF THOSE. YOU ABOUT IN YOUR- COMMUNITY FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT EMPLOYEES. THERE ARE FAMILY. AND THE AND THEY HAVE TO BE IN ORDER FOR BUSINESS TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND I SUSPECT ASSEMBLY MEMBER FLOOR WOULD GET WOULD AGREE. IF YOU TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOUR EMPLOYEES THEY'LL TAKE GOOD CARE YOU. AND THAT'S WHAT TALKING ABOUT HERE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT CREATING. GENERAL WILD ALLEGATIONS BETWEEN PEOPLE IT'S JUST THAT YOU KNOW I'M SICK MIKE FOR EXAMPLE MY GRANDMOTHER I GOT TO TAKE CARE OF MY GRANDMOTHER AND EMPLOYERS GONNA SHADY YOU LET'S WORK TOGETER WILL LET WILL MAKE IT HAPPEN. AND INSTEAD THIS IS FOR- SIMPLER SWITCHED SORRY CHARLIE BUT IF YOU IF YOU WANT TO TAKE THAT LEAP THAT YOU PAY FOR YOU'RE GOING TO BE FOR. AND REALLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE SO I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN HAPPY TO TALK WITH YOU FURTHER ABOUT THIS BUT- OF MY WHAT THIS BILL DOES. AND THE FACT THAT SMALL BUSINESSES ARE HAVING PROBLEMS NOW IS THE IN NOT IN DISPUTE. NOT IN DISPUTE AT ALL BUT MIGHT MARK WHAT I AM SUGGESTING IS THAT ALLOWING YOUR EMPLOYEES. IF AND WHEN THEY GET SICK NOT BECAUSE THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE WORKING BUT IF THEY ARE SICK OR A LOVED ONE IS SICK OR THEY HAVE A NEW BORN. THAT THEY WANT TO BOND WITH THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE THAT TIME. AND THERE ARE FIVE OTHER STATES BY THE WAY THEY DO THIS ACTUALLY THE GO DOWN TO ONE OR MORE EMPLOYEE- NEW YORK- OF RHODE ISLAND I BELIEVE LET'S SEE NEW YORK RIGHT AYE THAT COULD. HAVE THE RIGHTS OF ONE POINT. ARMED SEVERAL MAJOR MAIN STAGE YOU KNOW BIG STATE. DOING IT AND I'M NOT SURE. TO GO SERVICE THAT THE OTHER THING THAT BUSINESSES ARE NOT. AWFUL FAILING BECAUSE- THERE IS FAMILY LEAVE. ARE BECAUSE WE ARE PROVIDING THIS BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO SEEK REDRESS. THE SAME THING HAPPEN AGAIN I MENTIONED EARLIER WITH NEW CURRENTLY THE WORLD WAS GOING TO FALL LAWSUIT YOU'RE GOING TO BE THOUSANDS A LAWSUIT. THAT HASN'T HAPPENED. SUBMIT TO YOU IT'S DIFFICULT FOR BUSINESSES TO CHANGE THE WAY THINGS ARE IS REALLY MORE- REFLECTIVE OF WHAT ONCE WAS AND I SUBMIT THAT WE CAN. MAKE THESE CHANGES AND THE BUSINESSES WILL CONTINUE TO FLOURISH AND TO THRIVE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS THESE STUDIES BY THE WAY. THE START IT WAS DONE BY THE BAY AREA COUNCIL. DIDN'T REALLY PRODUCE ANYTHING KNOW WHICH HOUSE WAS CUT IT% CONFIRMED STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOR YOU THERE'S ABOUT BENEFIT TO PAID. WEEKLY AND THE BENEFITS OF HAVING JOB PROTECTION TO GO WITH THAT LEAVE. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS. SO THE- BILL IT'S A CHALLENGING TIME BUT I SUBMIT TO THE BUSINESS ARE CA OF FAILED. EMPLOYEE WHO ARE SICK ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THAT TIME OFF. BUSINESSES ARE GOING TO FAIL BECAUSE WE'VE GOT IT LICKED THIS PROBLEM THAT WE'VE GOT AND WE'VE GOT TO RECOGNIZE THAT BUSINESSES ARE FAMILIES. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL CALLS FOR AND WITH THAT. I WOULD PASS THROUGH YOUR CABLE SUMMARY JONES SAWYER AND HOPEFULLY THIS WILL BE A LOT. SHORTER BOB IT'S UP WENT UP WHEN I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND INVOLVEMENT IN GET THIS MOVING ON SO WE CAN CONTINUE UP THE DISCUSSION AT AND DIVE DEEPER INTO THIS I THOUGHT IT JUST TWO THINGS I WOULD LIKE WHAT IS ONE THING I LIKE YOU YOU TO DO AND THERE'S ONE THING THAT I WOULD DO IT I'M JUST GONNA LET YOU KNOW UP FRONT BOB ON THE KEEP YOUR TWELVE WEEK TO TWENTY FOUR WE THERE'S GOT TO BE. THE IS THE LANGUAGE. IN THE TO BE TWEAKED STILL WE HAVE CLARITY LET'S. LET'S AT LEAST GET THAT- THAT'S THAT'S ALWAYS REALLY FRUSTRATING FOR ME WHEN ONCE I SAID THAT THIS ONE AND I. WE ALL. WE ALL CAN WRITE SOMETHING THAT. VERY CLEAR SAID WE UNDERSTAND IT. IT'S TWELVE. AND NOT TWENTY FOUR- THAT HAS A- AND THEN ON THE SMALL BUSINESS. ASPECT MY SMALL BUSINESS MAY BE UNIQUE AS- MY COLLEAGUE TO THE NORTH AND SO WHY WE MAY BE TALKING BRICK AND MORTAR BOB I HAVE A LOT OF BUSINESSES THAT ARE ABLE TO BUY CARS IN YOUR KIDS TO COLLEGES AND THEY ARE ON THE DISTRIBUTOR. AND I DON'T AWARE DATE INTO THAT AND SO I WILL BE I ALSO DIDN'T SEE MY CHAMBERS. ON EITHER SIDE OF THIS DISCUSSION AND SO I WILL BY THE DISRUPTING I WILL DO I WILL PERSONALLY HAVE DISCUSSION WITH MY CHAMBERS ON THE IMPACTS OF SMALL BUSINESSES. AND HOW THIS LEGISLATION WILL IMPACT THEM. I'M I THINK MANY OF THEM ESPECIALLY THE SIDEWALK WITH VENDORS. MAY NOT EVEN FALL INTO THIS THIS MAY BE. FIVE THEY DID NOT FIGHT THEY MAY BE FOUR THREE. BUT THERE'S A LOT OF THAT. THEY WOULD BE IMPACTED BY THIS BUT IF THEY ARE AT A FULL HEAD OF- BY PERSON LEVEL SUPER SEVEN. I WORK WE'RE GOING TO MY STAFF AND ARE GOING TO GO OUT PERSONALLY ASK. HOW DO YOU HANDLE THIS MADNESS AT LEAST TALK ABOUT YOUR BILL BUT HOW DO YOU HANDLE THIS- AND I KNOW IT'S NOT THE MOST RIGHT PICK WAY. OF DOING THINGS BUT AT LEAST GET SENSE OF THIS BILL WILL IMPACT THE SMOG THIS IS. ACTUALLY MY DISTRICT AND TALKING TO INDIVIDUALS- WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS AND MAY HAVE THE STAFF. IS A LOT CONTINUE THAT WERE DISCUSSED. BUT EAST. BUT I GET TO LEAVE IT THERE SAY. THE NAME. THEY CAN BRING PEOPLE IN AND OUT THE AND IN THE PERSONAGE THAT. THEY'RE NOT THERE PERMANENTLY AND INOTES IT. AT LEAST FIGURE OUT COULD PEOPLE DO GET SICK AND I THINK MOST OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES I DISTRICT MAKE ALLOWANCES FOR THAT NAY DIG INTO IT WITH A FIGURE THAT OUT. BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE AND OBVIOUSLY TALKING TO CHAMBERS OF MY DISTRICT AND GET A SENSE OF THAT. AND THEN WE'RE WE'VE BEEN GOING. DOING COLD IT. RELATED THINGS WITH THE BUSINESSES IN MY DISTRICT AND WE HAVE SEVERAL ALLIES THAT WE COULD TALK TO. TO GET A SENSE OF THAT AND SO ON AND IN OUR REPORT THAT BACK TO YOU. AND THEN YOU CAN. YOU CAN DECIDE HOW WE CAN PROCEED. I WOULD LIKE TO IF I MAY IN RESPONSE FOR THAT IS A CLOSE- ORIGINALLY THIS MEASURE CALL FOR ONE OR EMPLOYEE. AND THAT THAT CREATED A LOT HANGS. SO IT'S SO WE MOVED TO FIVE FOR MORE. AS I MENTIONED THERE ARE NUMBER OF OTHER STATES THAT ARE DOING THIS. I ALSO WANT TO BE REALLY CLEAR. THAT WHEN AN EMPLOYEE GOES OFF ON THIS. JOB PROTECTED LEAVE FOR TWELVE WEEKS. IT IS ON PAGE. SO AS THE EMPLOYER. AND YOUR SMALL RESTAURANT. IN IN ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO SISTER YOU'VE NOW GOT THAT SALARY. THAT YOU CAN THEN OFFERED TO SHOP IN THE COMING TO WORK PART TO WORK A TEMPORARILY WHILE THAT OTHER EMPLOYEES SOFT. AND IF YOU HAVE A IF YOU KNOW MOST RESTAURANTS THEY CAN'T REALLY DO A LOT WHEN IT COMES TO BENEFITS. BUT IF YOU ARE WITH YOUR FULL TIME. HERS AND YOU'RE PAYING BENEFITS YOU BRING IN A YOU BRING IN SOMEONE WHO IS- TEMPORARY YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY THOSE BENEFITS EITHER. SO IF YOU CHOOSE TO BRING SOMEONE IN TO FILL THAT OTHER PERSON SPOT YOU'RE NOT PAYING TWICE. AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT RECOGNIZE YOU'RE NOT PAYING FOR THE EMPLOYEE WHO IS OUT ON THAT LEAVES. ITS JOB PROTECTED WHICH ON PAID THE ONLY PAYMENT THAT THE EMPLOYEE GETS IS FROM THAT. PAID FAMILY LEAVE THAT THEY PAID INTO THEMSELVES. SO THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK THAT'S REAL IMPORTANT WHEN IT COMES TO SMALL EMPLOYERS THEY'RE OT PAYING DOUBLE IN FACT THEY'RE NOT PAYING IT ALL AND WHAT HAPPENS IS IN THE REASON THAT. THE DATA SHOWS THAT COMPANIES ACTUALLY CAN FINANCIALLY BENEFIT DURING THAT. TIME IS BECAUSE THEY CAN SAVE THAT MONEY IN ONLY 19% OF COMPANIES. WILL GO OUT AND HIRE A REPLACEMENT THEY FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT WORK YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU GOT TO WORK A COUPLE EXTRA HOURS. THAT'S THE SIX ABILITY WE SEE SOME BUSINESSES SO I'D BE VERY INTERESTED. AS LONG AS WE'RE CLEAR ON WHAT THE BILL DOES AND DOESN'T DO. RAN I THINK THAT THAT IS THE PART OF PART OF. OUR CHALLENGES I MAY BE TALKING ABOUT BUSINESSES. THAT MAY NOT SHOW UP AND SURVEYS. BECAUSE THEY'RE IMMIGRANT POPULATION AND THEY DO NOT. SELF REPORT A REPORT A LOT OF THINGS AND SO. THE BAY AREA COUNCIL IN THEIR SURVEY AND I'M FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHAT GOES ON IN BAY AREA MAY NOT BE APROPOS WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR DISTRICT AND SO I. JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE REVIEWING APPLES TO APPLES RIGHT AND SO THAT I. DEBT THAT I TAKE CARE PEOPLE OF MY DISTRICT AND A TICKET IN RAT POPULATION MY DISTRICT BECAUSE OF THE REPORTS I GOT. ABOUT SMALL BUSINESSES. IT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO THEY'RE GOING TO SUFFER BECAUSE THE CALL OF IT YEAH. MAYBE AT A RATE OF 50% OF THE MAY CLOSE. IN MY DISTRICT A MAY BE 60% OR MORE. AND SO HOW DO I. HOW TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T FURTHER EXACERBATE THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE THE LARGEST EMPLOYER. EVEN THOUGH MY ALMA MATER USC TRIES TO CLAIM THAT THEY ARE. BY FAR SMALL BUSINESSES- EMPLOYED MUCH MORE MANY MORE PEOPLE- DAN DAN DAN U. S. C. SO- I THINK THERE'S A- THERE'S A PLACE I THINK THIS THIS IS IMPORTANT WE NEED TO DO THIS- WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE. IT DOES HAVE. A NECK PACKED. INDIVIDUALS THAT MAY BE KIND OF IN A BIT INVISIBLE. TO THIS ALL THESE DATE IS A STUDIES EVEN THOUGH DISRESPECT MY COLLEAGUE OVER OVER HERE- MISTER FORD IT IT IT MAY NOT. IT MAY NOT FALL IN THAT CATEGORY THESE BUSINESSES THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THAT. DEBT OF ISRAEL'S TALKING ABOUT THIS MADE GROUP THAT FALLS TO THE CRACKS AND THEN WE DON'T WANT THIS BILL. TO DRIVE. DRY FURTHER. CAN AND I THAT IN WITH CERTAIN LOOK AT AT A LOT OF THESE ARE PROBABLY BUSINESS THAT ONE OR TWO EMPLOYEES BUT IF THE BUT AGAIN EIGHT IT I THINK WE HAVE TO BE REAL CLEAR THAT THERE IS NO FINANCIAL BURDEN ON THE SMALL BUSINESSES. THEY'RE NOT BEING THEM AT THEIR NOT BEING ASKED TO PAY FOR THAT PERSON'S LEAVE. FACT THEY DON'T PAY AT ALL SO I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION AND I'D LOVE ACTUALLY I'D LOVE TO COME DOWN AND THE TAKE A WALK THROUGH SOME OF THOSE RESTAURANTS BECAUSE I'M ALWAYS UP FOR A GOOD MEAL. AND HAND WITH A ONE. ENDLESS SO EXPLAIN MORE BUT YOU KNOW LISTEN. I GUESS I HEAR. SO THAT THIS THIS BILL IS SOMETHING THOSE STUDIES HAVE BEEN DONE THEY'VE BEEN DOING SIMILAR STUDIES FOR DECADES THERE THAT THAT THIS THESE MOST RECENT ONE SIMPLY CONFIRM. PRIOR STUDY SO THIS IS NOT NEW INFORMATION- AND DIE I APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION. YOU KNOW CHANGES HARD- BUT I THINK WHAT WHAT ARE WE HAVE TO REMEMBER IS THAT THE CHANGE ALREADY OCCURRED WHICH IS. KIND OF PUT INTO PLACE. THOSE GUIDELINES THAT WILL REFLECT THE CHANGING WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE AND WITH THAT I WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE. THE SENATE A WANTED TO YOUR POINT ON AND I APPRECIATE THAT. THIS DOESN'T. DESERVE INVOLVED IN AN IN DEPTH CONVERSATION AT THE COMMITTEE LEVEL SO. I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THE AMOUNT OF TIME TO FOLKS TAKE BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT- AND THE- POINT OF STUDIES I DON'T KNOW WE DO HAVE. UP ANY WITH THIS. STORY. TO ON THE PHONE. I'M A IF. BUT SHE IS IF YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THE BAY AREA COUNCIL STUDY TO SEE THERE'S A PROCESS THERE. LET'S NOT BE CAN MOVE ON FROM THAT. YEAH THE PMR OPINION WITH SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY I'M HAPPY TO COMMENT ON FIRST AND FOREMOST WE ARE NOT MEMBERSHIP OF AN ORGANIZATION AS MENTIONED EARLIER- AND WE DO THAT SO THAT WE CAN BE AS INCLUSIVE AS POSSIBLE AS WE ARE SERVING VERY SMALL MICHAEL BUSINESS OWNERS THERE ARE RESEARCH ADVOCATES IN EDUCATION WORK. ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IN SEVERAL OTHER STATE. ON THE SECOND ON THE RESEARCH. BUT DURING THAT COALITION AND EIGHT. WHICH GET DIRECTLY AFTER QUESTION AROUND SHOP PROTECTIVELY. CALIFORNIA WHICH FOCUSED ON TWO DIFFERENT QUESTION ONE QUESTION WAS AROUND THE PORT OR OPPOSITION FINDING STOP PROTECTED LEAVE WHEN INVESTMENT HAS MORE THAN ONE. AT LEAST. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS LIKE AROUND. A GREEN UP HOW OR SUPPORT A DROP PROTECTED AMENDMENT THAT WAY OUR DOCTOR. I BRING THAT NUMBER DOWN TO FIVE ANNIE BOTH T. FIFTY PERCENT- THERE WITH OVER IF THAT AND THEN IT. WE FIGHT EMPLOYEES THAT'S SUPPORT WITH EVER ACTUALLY. BACK WAYS AT 59% OF TOTAL SUPPORT AND THEN IN TURN- ECONOMIC STUDY THAT WITH COOK. AND I'M ALSO HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE TOP TWENTY EIGHT. HE. QUITE BUT WHEN EIGHT THE COMMISSION ALSO BROUGH THE FAN UNIVERSITY- JOE NATION WHO REPRESENT UNIVERSITY AND OTHER PHD WHO WERE ABLE TO FIND AT THE FINDINGS THAT I HAD MENTIONED EARLIER. ALL REFLECT FIRM AND- THERE IS NO INCREASE OUR- EIGHT NINE EIGHT WE ARE IN. WE FELL IN. THAT OKAY THANK YOU NO I THINK FOR THE PER OF GETTING A LOT OF GOOD PERSPECTIVES OF FROM ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF THAT THIS EVENING AND I THINK- IT'S APPROPRIATE SO PROBABLY SO AND I'LL SAY THAT LOOKING OTHER THERE'S NO OTHER COUNTRIES OF THEM AS PAID FAMILY BY A PLAYER SIZE CALIFORNIA IS NOT ONLY FALLING BEHIND THE REST WILL BE NOW FIVE OTHER STATES. HAVE PASSED TO A PEAK I MEAN THE LAW TO PROTECT THE JOBS OF ALL WORKERS BECAUSE ONE PLAYER SIDE SIZE NOT QUALIFY FOR JOB PROTECTED LEAVE UNDER THE CURRENT STRICT STANDARDS OF THESE ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY LOW WAGE WORKERS OF COLOR WHO ARE OFTEN MORE VULNERABLE OF YOU SEE IN TO COVERED- BECAUSE OF PRE EXISTING SYSTEM SYSTEMATIC BARRIERS TO HEALTHCARE. THESE BECAUSE OF THE JEWS AND GOING TO WORK ON LOSING THEIR JOB. KEEP UP A LOT OF WORKERS AND FOR PER A BLOCK OR ARE EMPLOYED IN FRONT MY ESSENTIALS. A ARE OVER REPRESENTED IN MANY FRONTLINE ESSENTIAL INDUSTRIES. MAKING 90% OF FRMWORKERS 70% OF THE SOCIAL WORKERS. 15% A COOKS AND SIXTY FOUR PERCENT. OF PREPARES. BUT CAN I GET A COMMUNITIES FACE OF STANGEL SYSTEMIC BARRIERS ADEQUATE HEALTHCARE. BEFORE COVER NINETEEN AND NOW PARTICULARLY ARE VULNERABLE. AS WE'VE SEEN OF THE EXPOSURE AT WORK. OF MY DISTRICT ALTHOUGH SILICON VALLEY MY DISTRICTS A 50% PLUS LATINO. WE HAVE THE POOREST. ZIP CODES AND CENSUS TRACTS IN THE IN THE BAY AREA. THE HIGHEST RATE ABOVE IT SO I WANT TO. DISPEL THE MYTH THAT EVERYBODY IN THE BAY AREA IS RICH AND IS DOING JUST OKAY. DOING FINE. IT'S NOT THE CASE AND I HAVE A LOT OF WORKERS MY DISTRICT THAT. BECAUSE CERTAINLY TELL YOU OTHERWISE SB. THIRTEEN PARTICULARLY AND- I'D ARE UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS PAID FAMILY LEAVE IS AVAILABLE. TO ALL WORKERS BECAUSE IMMIGRATION STATUS BECAUSE THEY ALL INTO IT. AND IF YOU LOOK AT OTHER COUNTRIES THAT HAVE THINGS LIKE SINGLE PAYER HEALTHCARE THAT HAVE PAID FAMILY LEAVE HUNDRED PERCENT. FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME AND HOW THEY'RE DEALING WITH THIS PANDEMIC LET ALONE. EVEN OUTSIDE OF A PANDEMIC ENVIRONMENT HOW WELL THEIR FAMILIES ARE TAKEN CARE OF HOW THEIR FAMILY CENTERED. AND REALLY WHO'S IN THE BEST POSITION TO ABSORB PAIN. AND I THINK THAT WE COULD HOPEFULLY AGREED TO WORKERS IN THE IN THE LEAST BENEFICIAL POSITION TO ABSORB THAT PAN. SMALL BUSINESSES WOULD BE. TO THE NEXT LEVEL UP WHERE WE HAVE TO DO WE CAN TO PROTECT THEM AND SUPPORT THEM BUT AS- THE SENATOR SAID THIS IS UNPAID LEAVE. IT'S PAID BY US WE PAY INTO IT. BUT THE WORKERS UNPAID SO THEY DO HAVE TO MANAGE THE TIME WHETHER SIX WEEKS EIGHT pTO MANAGE OPERATIONS DURING THAT TIME. AND THAT'S AND THAT'S VERY LOW BUT THEY CAN USE THAT SAME MONEY THEY WOULD PAY TO BRING IN SOME TEMPORARILY OR- FIGURE A MAN WITH THE WORKFORCE IF THEY HAVE. BUT THAT WERE TO A WORKER BASICALLY YOU GET SICK YOU HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF A LOVED ONE YOU'RE OUT OF A JOB AND THEY'RE JUST UPON IT IN HIS MACHINERY. AND THIS IS ACTUALLY A JOBS UBER BECAUSE IT SAVES THAT INDIVIDUAL THEIR JOB. AND IT'S SOMEONE THAT THE EMPLOYER ALREADY LIKES AND HAS ON THEIR SPOUSE OR NOT TIME TO HIRE SOMEONE. THEY DON'T WANNA HAVE WORKING FOR THEM IT'S IN SO IT'S GOOD PUBLIC POLICY FOR A SOCIAL CONTRACT. THAT ACTUALLY SUPPORTS FAMILIES. AND IT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S EASY. UP PLAYING CATCH UP. WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD. IN TERMS OF PROTECTING AND CARE OUR FAMILIES ISN'T EASY AND I THINK WE DO HAVE TO RECKON. GROWING SPECIAL SMALL BUSINESSES AS YOU MOVE FORWARD. YOU HARD THINGS TO. AND I KNOW EVERYONE THAT'S ON THIS COMMITTEE IS UP TO THE TASK- AS AS I'M A CERTAINLY THE AUTHOR CENTER. JACKSON IS AND SO- WE DO HAVE A MOTION FROM SOME NUMBER GONZALEZ SECONDED BY AS A MEMBER RIVAS. A SERGEANTS AT CENTER JACKSON WHICH IS TO MAKE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS NO I CHOSE TO. OTHER THAN TO SAY THIS IS NOT AN EASY CHOICE. QUESTION ABOUT BUT I. YOU THAT WHEN IT COMES. SMALL BUSINESS THIS IS NOT. AT AND WEIGHING THE AND BASS. PEOPLE SOMEONE BEING SENT NEEDS AND WEARING BUSINESSES. ARE THE SMALL BUSINESSES ARE KIND OF SHOW. FROM THIS BECAUSE ANY. LOSS I THINK OF THE DATA DE SHOW THAT CA. CHECK DO. WHEN THOSE EMPLOYEE COME BACK. THEY ARE THE THEY'RE LOYAL. THEY PRE. THE OPPORTUNITY THAT THEY HAD TO DO OTHER THINGS ON THEIR- OTHER THAN CHEST BE EMPLOY. IT'S A WIN WIN. AND SO WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR I CALLED. THANK YOU. LISTENING TO ME TO FOR ON THE ON SB THIRTY EIGHT. MOTION IS TO PROBE. KALRA FIVE KALRA FIVE. FLORA NO CARILLO. CAREER I DO.

TO A WORKERS HAVE NEVER BEEN TO CALIFORNIA BEFORE AND ARE BELIEVED TO NEITHER SPEAK NOR READ ENGLISH. IF THEY ARE FIRED FOR ANY REASON THEY'RE SUBJECT TO IMMEDIATE DEPORTATION WHICH IS A POWERFUL DISINCENTIVE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT ANY ABUSE OF WORKPLACE CONDITIONS THAT THEY MAY BE SUBJECTED TO. THE COMMITTEE HAS PROVIDED EVIDENCE OF CURRENT ABUSES IN THIS PROGRAM. MANY OF THESE ABUSES ARE ALSO VIOLATIONS OF CALIFORNIA LAWS WHICH H. TO A FARMWORKERS GENERALLY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT BECAUSE NEITHER THE US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. NOR THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT GOOD MINISTER THE PROGRAM REQUIRE WORKERS TO BE TOLD OF THIS IS FINANCIAL BODY OF CALIFORNIA LAWS THAT PROVIDE PROTECTIONS GREATER THAN THE FEDERAL H. TO A PROGRAM. IN THE LAW IS CLEAR IF YOU'RE WORKING IN CALIFORNIA YOU'RE PROTECTED BY CALIFORNIA LAWS AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL. SB ELEVEN OH TWO BILLS THAT IN GAP BY REQUIRING H. TWIN TO PROVIDE EACH TO A FARMWORKERS ON THEIR FIRST DAY AT WORK WITH A SHORT COMPREHENSIVE WRITTEN SUMMARY OF KEY LABOR.

WHICH ARE COMMON PLACE AND HOW. BUT NOT SO OTHER. AND LAW UNKNOWN THESE WERE. AND WITHOUT EVEN BEING ADVISED THAT IT EXISTED. THESE WORKERS ARE ROBBED OF HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO PAY OVER THE TERM OF THEIR CONTRACT AND OFTEN DON'T EVEN KNOW IT. THIS BILL PROTECT TAKES TO WAY WORKERS BYENSURING THAT THEY KNOW THEY'RE RIGHT. IT ALSO PROTECTS DOMESTIC WORKERS WHO WORK ALONG SIGNED THEM AND MIGHT BE HESITATE HESITANT TO DEMAND THEIR RIGHTS BECAUSE THEY FEAR THEY'LL BE REPLACED BY ANOTHER H. TO A WORKER WHO DOESN'T KNOW OUT AND THEREFORE CANNOT MAKE SIMILAR DEMANDS. THIS BILL WILL HELP ENSURE THAT THE EXPANDED PROTECTIONS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS EXTENDED TO WORKERS OVER THE LAST A HUNDRED AND TEN YEARS ARE KNOWN TO.

HI MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MARK SHOCKED WITH CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION THAT SPONSORED THE BILL VERY SIMPLY AS THE SENATOR AND MS RICE HAVE. HAVE REFERENCED SB ELEVEN- TO PULL TOGETHER INTO A SINGLE DOCUMENT TO BE PROVIDED TO H. COOLEY WITH FARMWORKERS AND SPANISH ON THE FIRST DAY OF WORK INFORMATION ABOUT SEVERAL DOZEN CALIFORNIA LABOR HOUSING HEALTH AND SAFETY AND OTHER LAWS THEY NEED THAT THE US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED. ESSENTIALLY A CAPTIVE WORKFORCE FOR EXAMPLE NOTHING IN THE FEDERAL AGE TO A CONTRACT GIVEN TO WORKERS BY THE EMPLOYER. REQUIRES THIS SPECIFIC STATE LAW INFORMATION TO BE DISCLOSED AND I'LL JUST TOUCH ON A FEW OF THE IMPORTANT PROVISIONS. THAT ARE IN SB ELEVEN OR TWO. WHERE AT. OR STATE EMERGENCY OR DISASTER HAS BEEN DECLARED IN THE CALIFORNIA COUNTY WHERE THEY WORK. HOW TO DETERMINE EVERY YEAR BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THE PROPER STAYS IN STATE OVERTIME GREAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE EACH YEAR. OR THAT THEIR TITLE COULD BE PAID A RITE AID TO A WRECK A PAID REST PERIODS TO PAY OF TEN MINUTES FOR EACH FOUR HOURS WORK. IF THEY MAY NOT BE CHARGED FOR MEALS NOT TAKEN. TITLE TO TRAVEL TIME CONVERSATION AT THE REGULAR RATE OF PAY FOR TIME SPENT WHILE BEING TRANSPORTED BY THE EMPLOYER. FROM HIS HOUSING TO WITH THE WORK SITE. RIGHT THAT TENANTS WHILE RESIDING IN THE EMPLOYERS HOUSING AND CAN REALLY RECEIVED GAS OF THEIR CHOOSING AND SHALL NOT BE SUBJECTED TO UNANNOUNCED SEARCHES OF THEIR HOMES. THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE TRAINING IN SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION AND HAVE REPORTED THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT THE TOILETS HAND WASHING FACILITIES AND COOL POTABLE WATER AT EACH WORKSITE. REPAIRED TITLE TO BE TRAINED IN RECOGNIZING AND PREVENTING DETAILED US DURING HIGH KEEP WORK PERIOD. BETTER FAIR EXPO TO PASS.

THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO HEADLAMPS WERE AFFECTED GARMENTS ARE TO BE PROVIDED OTHER LIGHTING SAYS WELL ATTENDED DALY SAFETY BRIEFING AT EACH WORK SITE. AND THAT THE INJURED THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO GIVE IT A WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIM FORM WITHIN ONE DAY. THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE CRITICAL DISCLOSURES SB ELEVEN OH TWO REQUIRES.

HI GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD EVENING THIS IS MATTHEW WITH THAT WESTERN GORE'S ASSOCIATION APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY ON THE BILL AT TODAY WE ARE OPPOSED TO ELEVEN OH TOO BECAUSE THAT- FRANKLY REPRESENTS MORE THAN JUST A BILL OF RIGHTS IT SUBSTANTIALLY CHANGES THE LAW AND TO- CRITICAL AREAS THE FIRST IT ON TRAVEL TIME- THE SECOND IS ON- HOUSING. ON TRAVEL I AM THE BILL ATTEMPTS TO ACTUALLY CHANGE THE BOB BYE BYE THE FAILING TO DENOTE CRITICAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN MANDATED INVOLUNTARY TRAVEL TIME. WHEN THE TRAVEL TIME IS MANDATED THAT IS COMPENSABLE TIME BUT WHEN IT VOLUNTARY- IT NOT COMPENSABLE AND WE BELIEVE THE BILL SHOULD ACTUALLY MADE STATIONS THAT THIS CLAIMING TO BE A BILL OF RIGHTS. HAVE CAN YOU TO ASK A THE OPPOSITE SPONSOR TO MAKE THAT. AND IF NOT THEN THEN THE BILL SHOULD JUST BATTLING WHICH SHOULD BE-STRICKEN OUT- SO THAT WE ARE EXISTING LOT IS THE SECOND ISSUE IS ON H. TO A EMPLOYER PROVIDED HOUSING AND THEN MAKING. THE AGE TO WAY EMPLOYEE AN ACTUAL TENANTS. UNDER CALIFORNIA HOUSING LAW- THAT'S EXTRAORDINARILY PROBLEMATIC- GIVEN THAT THE- HOUSING IS PROVIDED AS PART OF THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP AND- WE DON'T BELIEVE. THAT THAT- IT'S APPROPRIATE TO. SIMPLY MAKE A BLANKET- POLICY THAT THAT THAT THAT EMPLOYEE NOW HAS TENNESSEE RIGHT IN CALIFORNIA SO FOR THOSE REASONS AND OTHERS WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL. THANK YOU I BELIEVE WE HAVE BRIAN LITTLE COMPANY FORMER ALLY NOW. YES BUT YOU'RE TERRIBLY BRIGHT LITTLE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY THE THANK. YOU VISION TO THE ISSUES THAT MISTER ALLEN REYES RESPECT TO THOSE TWO WE THINK ARE IMPORTANT CHANGES THE LAW THAT DESERVED TO BE DEBATED.

ARE SUPPOSEDLY DID NOT INFORM THEIR EMPLOYEES ABOUT MOST THINGS ARE NOT TRUE- WE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU PROVIDE FIVE LAMINATED POSTERS- TOO MANY OF ITS MEMBERS THAT THIS WAS A GREAT MANY OF THE THINGS THAT DESCRIBED IN THE TESTIMONY.

THE CARD NUMBER WE CAN'T GUARANTEE WITH AGRICULTURAL COUNCIL RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION FOR THE REDUCE PREVIOUSLY STATED THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND NOW TO LIVE FIVE THERE SIX WE AGO. KEVIN ANDERSON ON BEHALF OF ONE MAKERS POWER AND OPPOSITION THINK DEAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN Q. THANK YOU I'M ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM. THE COMMITTEE pWE DO HAVE A MOTION- I WANT TO THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR FOR BRING THIS FORWARD AND PRICKLY IN REGARDS TO- THE HOUSING COMPONENT OF IT BECAUSE- YES THERE MAY BE AN UNPLANNED EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP. THAT ARRANGES. THE HOUSING BUT YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE BASIC FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF TENANCY INPUT INTO THE IMPLIED WANTING HABITABILITY AND OTHER TENNESSEE RIGHTS. SHOULD APPLY TO EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE ARRANGEMENT CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENT IS THAT CREATES THAT HOUSING THE END OF MY MIGHT JUST COMMENT ON THAT MISTER CHAIR YEAH. THE BILL DOES NOT CREATE TENANT RATES FOR H. TO A GUEST WORKER SOME OF THOSE HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED BY OUR COURTS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EXTENDS. TENANT RIGHTS TO ALL WORKERS INCLUDING GUEST WORKERS. THE GUEST WORKER PROGRAM PROVIDES THAT THE EMPLOYER PROVIDES TRANSPORTATION AND HOUSING- AND SO IF I CAN JUST ADDRESS THE TRANSPORTATION ISSUE AS WELL. AGAIN THERE'S A LAW IN CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT THE ROYAL PACKING CASE THERE'S BEEN CASES LITIGATED THAT HAVE SETTLED FOR MILLIONS OF DOLLARS- BUT WHAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT EACH TO A WORKERS. AND IT'S WHERE I THINK THE OPPOSITION ISN'T BEING TOTALLY TRANSPARENT. THE FEDERAL CONTRACT THE EMPLOYER PROVIDES TRANSPORTATION AND HOUSING WORKERS ARE BROUGHT IN BUSES FROM MEXICO FOR THE MOST PART. THEY DON'T HAVE THEIR OWN VEHICLES THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SO WHERE SOME OF THE LITIGATION HAS LOOKED AT WHETHER. TRANSPORTATION IS MANDATORY OR OPTIONAL THAT DOESN'T EXIST FOR AN H. TO A GUEST WORKER THEY ARE HOUSED BY THE EMPLOYER THE EMPLOYER UNDER THE FEDERAL CONTRACT PROVIDES TRANSPORTATION TO THE WORK SITE. SO THIS SEEKS TO CLARIFY. THAT OBLIGATION AND THAT IT'S INCLUDED IN THE NOTICE THIS BILL ULTIMATELY PROVIDES NOTICE TO WORKERS INDIVIDUALLY NOT A POSTER THAT'S POSTED. IN A HOUSING AREA OR IN A BUS OR ON A- TOILET NAM IT GIVES EACH WORKER. SOMETHING THEY CAN READ ON HIS OR HER OWN TIME IN BE MADE AWARE OF THEIR RIGHTS UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW- IN. ALL MAKE THAT MY CLOTHES INVESTORS OTHER QUESTIONS THAT ENTERTAIN OTHER QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THAT WORKS AND WE HAVE A MOTION FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER CARILLO SECONDED BY SOME MEMBERS JONES SAWYER.
