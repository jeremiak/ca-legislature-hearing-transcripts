THE SENATOR ALLEN WHOSE CODE SHARING THIS WITH ME IS AN A R. DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS AT THE MOMENT WE'RE NOT SURE HOW LONG THAT'S LASTING. HOWEVER -- WE WILL HAVE -- STAFF MEMBERS HERE. AND I THINK IT'S BEST THAT WE JUST START AND RECOGNIZE THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME HERE -- TO BOTH LISTEN AND PRESENT. SO GOOD AFTERNOON I'D LIKE TO WELCOME YOU ALL TO THE JOINT HEARING IN THE ASSEMBLY ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY AND TOXIC MATERIALS COMMITTEE. AND THE SENATE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEE -- I'M BILL QUIRK CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITTEE -- TODAY WILL DISCUSS THE STATE'S EFFORT AND PROTECTING PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT FROM TOXIC MATERIALS. IN PRODUCTS THROUGH IMPLEMENTING A REPROCESSED GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM. EACH YEAR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CHEMICALS ARE MANUFACTURED IN -- IMPORTED INTO THE UNITED STATES. AS WE ALL KNOW CHEMICAL PRODUCTS CAN HAVE IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS THAT IMPROVE OUR EVERYDAY LIVES. HOWEVER WE DON'T KNOW MUCH WHAT WE HOWEVER WHAT WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IS HOW THESE SUBSTANCES. CAN EFFECT -- YOU MEN AN ECO SYSTEM HEALTH. THIS BRINGS JUST GREEN CHEMISTRY GREEN CHEMISTRY IS A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH PROTECTION AND IT'S YOU KNOW IN THERE WAS A TIME [inaudible] WHEN -- THE ASSEMBLY IN THE SENATE MIGHT VOTE ON BANNING THE CHEMICAL OR STANDING IN ANY -- SUBSTANCE IN WHICH THERE'S A TRACE OF THE CHEMICAL. IT'S MUCH BETTER IN FACT TO DO TWO THINGS ONE IS TO USE THE BEST SCIENCE. AND THE OTHER IS TO LOOK AT IF YOU WERE TO BAN THAT CHEMICAL AND WHAT WILL HAPPEN AND ARE THEIR SUBSTITUTES THAT ARE ACTUALLY SAFER -- IS THIS -- OR IT CAN WE DO WITHOUT THIS. CHEMICAL OR ANY SUBSTITUTE FOR IT ALL TOGETHER OR IS THERE IS A SUBSTITUTE AND THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE. IN MY MIND AND WHAT GREEN CHEMISTRY DOES. SO IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE LEGISLATURE LEGISLATURE ENACTED TWO BILLS A. B. EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE AND SB. FIVE OH NINE TO ESTABLISH A GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA. TODAY WERE FOCUSING ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A. B. -- EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE THE AUTHORS ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MIKE FOR YOUR AND JARED HOFFMAN CLEARLY STATED THEIR INTENT WITH THIS BILL WAS PAID A COMPREHENSIVE. SCIENCE BASED AND DELIBERATE APPROACH TO CHEMICALS POLICY. TO PROVIDE THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCE CONTROLLER. WITH CLEAR AUTHORITY TO REGULATE HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS IN ALL PRODUCTS WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS. I'D LIKE TO NOTE THAT WHEN THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED AGAIN GREEN CHEMISTRY BELLS WAS NO FISCAL ANALYSIS COMPLETED FOR EITHER VEIL. MAKING THE FUTURE COSTS OF IMPLEMENTATION ON CERTAIN. IN FACT WERE NOT SURE TODAY THAT WE HAVE FUNDED THIS AT THE RIGHT LEVEL -- GIVEN THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES AND CONTROL. IS FACING FISCAL CHALLENGES WE WILL BE DISCUSSING THEIR BUDGET. AND A JOINT HEARING LATER THIS MONTH THE PURPOSE OF A HEARING TWO DAYS TO ASSESS WHETHER THE GAME CHEMISTRY PROGRAM HAS ACCOMPLISHED THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE OF THE LAST TEN AND A HALF YEARS. AND DETERMINE HOW WE CAN INSURE ITS GREATEST SUCCESS IN THE FUTURE -- SO I WOULD LIKE -- TO JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE VICE CHAIR OF SENATE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY -- SENATOR PATRICIA BATES IS WITH THIS AND THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER REBEKAH POWER KAHAN -- NEW MEMBER OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY AND TOXIC MATERIALS. ARE COMMITTEE IS ALSO HERE -- AND I'D LIKE TO WELL. THEY ARE THE ONLY MEMBERS HERE AT THE MOMENT BEFORE WE GET STARTED -- I DO WANNA THANK. OF THE SENATE -- FOR I DOING THIS COMMITTEE JOINTLY SO WE CAN START WITH THE SAME SET OF FACTS -- AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE WITNESSES WE HAVE HERE TODAY AND THERE WILL BE PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE END OF THIS -- SO. I SELL IT NOW CENTER BAD THAT ALLEN IS HERE HE'S GOTTEN OUT OF HIS OTHER MEETING. AND AGAIN I REALLY WANT TO THANK HIM -- FOR HAVING THIS IS A JOINT HEARING SO AS A SAID WE CAN OPERATE FROM THE SAME SET OF FACTS. IT'S MY HOPE. THAT IF THERE'S A BILL PASSED IN SENATE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OR AN ASSEMBLY -- ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY AND TOXIC MATERIALS. THAT. WHEN IT REACHES THE OTHER COMMITTEE THAT WILL BE BECAUSE WE WORK FROM THE SAME SET OF FACTS AND VALUES? THAT IN FACT -- THE AUTHORS OF WHAT PASSED IN ONE HOUSE WILL NOT HAVE TO SEE RADICAL CHANGES IN THE NEXT ONE THAT'S OUR HOPE. DOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN BUT THAT'S MY HOPE -- SO SENATOR ALLEN WOULD YOU LIKE. TO SIT MAKE A FEW OPENING REMARKS THANK YOU CHAIRED QUIRK AND I DO APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE WE WERE. THE THE CAUCUS IS STILL IN A DEEP. DISCUSSION ABOUT ANOTHER IMPORTANT TOPIC OF P. JEANNIE PATADA -- AN ISSUE I'M SURE YOU'VE SPENT SOME TIME THINKING ABOUT BUT I DO APPRECIATE YOU GREAT DEAL I APPRECIATE THE MEETING THAT WE HAD NOT TOO LONG AGO TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THESE ISSUES. AND I DO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT WILL BE CORNY TOGETHER. ARE AND ON THE ISSUE OF OF YOU KNOW YOU GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF THIS ISSUE. AND THE LEADERSHIP OF PREVIOUS MEMBERS WHO HAVE WHO REALLY UNDERSTOOD THE FACT THAT -- THAT THAT -- THAT IF CALIFORNIANS YOU KNOW WANT TO MAINTAIN THEIR STANDARD OF LIVING THEY THEY THEY THEY CERTAINLY WANT TO HAVE THEIR SANTA LIVING IMPROVED BY MODERN CHEMISTRY. BUT WITHOUT EXPOSURE TO DANGEROUS. HI DANGEROUS CHEMICALS. AND SO WHEN THIS IS HOW WE WE GREW THIS CONCEPT OF GREEN CHEMISTRY IN. AND THIS IS A AN IDEA WHEREBY WE LOOK AT THE GOODS THAT PEOPLE USE EVERY DAY. WE FIND DANGERS IN THOSE GOODS THAT CAN BE REMEDIED. AND WE IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE THOSE PRODUCTS TO MINIMIZE RISKS AND THAT'S AT THE THE CORE OF OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE AND IT WAS TO THAT IN THE TEN YEARS AGO THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE PASSED TO LAWS. BOTH ME SOME IN THE SENATE SIDES THAT ESTABLISHED THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM WITHIN THE DTS SEE THAT WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT TODAY. AND SO THE IDEA IS TO USE THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE IN AN OPEN AND TRANSPARENT PROCESS. TO MAKE APPROPRIATE REGULATORY DECISIONS. AND WE'RE GONNA BE HEARING FROM A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN WORKING TO LEARN ABOUT HOW THE FIRST TEN YEARS HAVE GONE WE WANNA KNOW WHAT'S WORKING WELL WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS IT WE WE WE CERTAINLY WANT AND ALSO KNOW WHERE STAKEHOLDERS FEEL AS THOUGH THE PROGRAM. HAS BENEFITED CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS WHERE IT'S FALLEN SHORT. AND AND AND YOU KNOW LOOK TO TO TO TO TO SEE WHAT SORT OF LEGISLATIVE REMEDIES MAY BE NECESSARY. MOVIE FOR BUT I DO APPRECIATE LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE SO NUMBER QUIRK AND AND ALL THE WAY HARD WORK OF THE STAFF ON BOTH. THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE SIDES ARE HELPING TO PUT THIS TOGETHER I HOPE IS THE OTHER MEETING AND WE'LL HAVE SOME MORE OF OUR A SENATORS COME OVER [inaudible] YEAH. YES OF COURSE THE ASSEMBLY -- STAFF MEMBERS OF COURSE WROTE MY COMMENTS THAT I GAVE EARLIER AND OF COURSE THEY DIDN'T MENTION THE GREAT WORK THEY'VE DONE. BUT SHANNON THE KIDNEY AND TRASH TALKER MY TWO STAFF MEMBERS HAVE BROUGHT THIS TOGETHER AND I WANT TO THANK THEM VERY MUCH AND YOU PROBABLY WANT TO THANK YOUR STAFF. WELL WE GET THE WHOLE THE WHOLE TEAM ACTUALLY WANT TO HAVE TALK WHATEVER HIS WORK ON THIS -- WE HONESTLY THAT THE ASSEMBLY TOOK THE LEAD THIS TIME BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO BE A PART OF IT THINKING. MENTION THAT. I GUESS YOU GUYS -- ABOUT ERIC WALTERS OUR SCIENCE FILE PHOTO OKAY SO ERIC WALTERS A SCIENCE VALLEY DEBT YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR MICROPHONE ON BUT THAT'S OUR I DON'T REPEATED. ITSELF THANK YOU ERIC FOR BEING HERE -- SCIENCE FELLAS ARE VERY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR PROCESS MY SCIENCE FELLOW. XIAO FINE GUY IS -- IN THE FRONT ROW OVER THERE WITH OUR OTHER -- STAFF MEMBER -- PAGE BROCA. ALL RIGHT A SENATOR BATES -- DO YOU HAVE ANY OPENING REMARKS FACED IT AGAIN CENTER IS VICE CHAIR OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE OKAY. THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAUER KAHAN. AND THEN WE'VE BEEN JOINED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER LAURA FRIEDMAN WHO IS CHAIR OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE -- WHICH ALSO DEALS WITH RELATED ISSUES SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE ASSEMBLY MEMBER DO YOU. YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS. ALL RIGHT. SO THE FIRST PERSON UP TODAY THIS DOCTOR MARTIN MULL THE HELL. GENERAL PARTNER OF SAFER MADE SO YOU CAN COME UP AND JUST SIT IN FRONT OF WHAT ONE OF THE MICROPHONES. GENERAL PARTNER SAFER MADE A VENTURE CAPITAL FIRM AND CO FOUNDER OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. EMERITUS OF THE BERKELEY CENTER FOR GREEN CHEMISTRY. TO EXPLAIN TO US WHAT GREEN CHEMISTRY IS AND HOW IT CAN MAKE PRODUCTS SAFER. AYE FORTUNATELY HAD A CHANCE. TO TALK WITH DOCTOR MORE OF A MOLEHILL EARLIER SO HE STARTED OUT FRESNO. GOT A PHD IN CHEMISTRY -- LEARNED -- THEN SET UP THE GREEN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL IN BERKELEY AND THEN PEOPLE ACTUALLY CAME TO HIM AND SAID. YOU KNOW WOULD REALLY LIKE TO INVEST IN SAFER PRODUCTS. AND HE ENDED UP DOING SOMETHING HERE I NEVER EXPECTED HE WOULD DO -- WHICH IS -- TO BECOME A VENTURE CAPITALIST SO -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN QUIRK CHAIRMAN ALAN. AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR GIVING THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU. TODAY ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF SUPPORTING GREEN CHEMISTRY. I'M A CHEMIST AND I KNOW AND LOVE THINKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT EVERYTHING WE CAN TOUCH SEE SMELL INTERACT WITH IT'S MADE OUT OF MOLECULES. SINCE LEARNING ABOUT GREEN CHEMISTRY WILL GRADUATE SCHOOL I'VE BEEN COMMITTED TO ACCELERATING THE DEVELOPMENT AND ADOPTION OF SAY FOR CHEMISTRY FIRST AT THE UC BERKELEY CENTER FOR GREEN CHEMISTRY AND NOW IT'S SAFER MADE. JUST. JUST A SECOND WE'RE HAVING SOME TROUBLE WITH THE MICROPHONES. MAYBE I PUSHED THE WRONG BUT NOT SURE [inaudible] CHECK. YEAH. ALL RIGHT LET'S SEE IF IT WORKS NOW. EXCELLENT HOW'S THAT OKAY FINE [inaudible] PERFECT. I RECOGNIZE THE EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM MAY NOT SHARE MY LOVE OF CHEMISTRY. REGARDLESS I HOPE TO CONVINCE YOU THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TIME TO ACCELERATE THE GROWING MOVEMENT TOWARD INHERENTLY SAFER CHEMISTRY. HEALTHIER PRODUCTS AND HEALTHIER WORKPLACES IN CALIFORNIA. IN OUR BUSINESSES SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES WE ALREADY HAVE THE BUILDING BLOCKS WE NEED TO USHER IN A NEW ERA OF SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS. THE DEMAND FOR SAFER PRODUCTS IS PART OF AN YOUR REVERSIBLE SOCIAL TREND. IT'S PART OF OUR MODERN AGE SHIFT TOWARDS HEALTHIER LIVING MORE SECURE LIVES. OTHER SIMILAR DEVELOPMENTS HAVE BEEN THINGS LIKE. REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF SMOKING FOCUSING ON CHILD SAFETY. FOCUSING ON HEALTH AND NUTRITION. THESE WELLNESS TRENDS ARE NOT NEW ST WE ARE ENTERING A NEW PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT AND HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IN FRONT OF US TODAY. FOR MANY CONSUMERS. THE MATERIAL CHEMICAL SAFETY OF PRODUCTS HAS BECOME A NEW DIMENSION OF THEIR PURCHASING DECISIONS. THIS CHANGE IN PREFERENCE IS RESHAPING ENTIRE PRODUCT CATEGORIES AND SECTORS. A GROWING NUMBER OF PEOPLE. IDENTIFY WITH LIFESTYLES OF HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY. AND HEALTH IS THEIR BIGGEST CONCERN. SO SIGNIFICANT PRODUCT PRODUCT CATEGORIES HAVE BEEN TRANSFORMED INCLUDING FOOD PERSONAL CARE CLEANING PRODUCTS AND INCREASINGLY APPAREL IN BUILDINGS. THINK ABOUT IT PEOPLE START WITH THE THINGS THEY CONSUME LITERALLY PUT IN THEIR BODY AND THEN THEY START THINKING ABOUT THE PRODUCTS THEY PUT ON THEIR SKIN BRING INTO THEIR HOME AND SHARE WITH THEIR FAMILY. MANY CONSUMERS BECOME SENSITIZED TO THESE ISSUES WHEN THEY BEGIN TO HAVE FAMILIES WHEN THEY BEGIN TO HAVE CHILDREN. THIS IS A TIME WHERE PEOPLE MAKE ARE OPEN TO NEW INFORMATION AND MAKE NEW DECISIONS ABOUT SWITCHING BRANDS AND CREATING NEW HABITS. PEOPLE'S CONCERN ABOUT EXPOSURE. TO CHEMICALS -- AND THE RISKS THEY PRESENT TO THEIR FAMILIES TRANSLATES INTO A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR DEMAND FOR SAFER PRODUCTS AND THE CHEMISTRY'S THAT ARE NEEDED TO MAKE THEM. IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE ORGANIC FOOD MOVEMENT AS A GOOD PROXY. TAKE A LOOK AT THE FACT THAT ORGANIC FOOD HIS GROWN 12% YEAR AFTER YEAR. FROM TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR TO TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN DURING THAT AMOUNT OF TIME. THERE WERE ACQUISITIONS OF COMPANIES PUBLICLY DISCLOSED ABOUT HALF OF ALL THE ANY WORK OVER FORTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW WEALTH CREATED FROM THE ORGANIC FOOD MOVEMENT. SIMILARLY AND YOU CAN SEE ON THE TABLE BELOW. COMPANIES THAT ARE LEADING -- WITH MATH ARE ALL PERFORMING QUITE WELL. SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR OUR HEARING HERE TODAY. WHAT I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU THAT TEN YEARS AGO IN CALIFORNIA LAUNCH THE GREEN CHEMISTRY INITIATIVE TO ADVANCE THE SAFER USE OF CHEMICALS THERE WAS AS THERE IS TODAY AND DESIRE FOR HEALTHIER CHEMISTRY IN OUR PRODUCTS AND WORKPLACES? AT THAT TIME MIKE WILSON AND OTHERS IDENTIFIED THREE GAPS THAT WE'RE LIMITING THE ADOPTION OF SAFER CHEMISTRY. WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS TAKE A MOMENT AND REMEMBER THOSE GAPS? BECAUSE EACH OF THOSE GAPS HAS ACTUALLY BEEN. PROVEN TO BE AN OPPORTUNITY WERE RELATIVELY SMALL INVESTMENTS AND EITHER CAPITAL OR IN YOUR CASE IN ACTIONS. CAN HAVE AN OUTSIZED INFLUENCE ON THE ADOPTION OF SAFER CHEMISTRY IN OUR SOCIETY. SO START WITH THE FIRST GAP. THE NEED FOR INFORMATION. PROPERLY FUNCTIONING MARKETS REQUIRE THE FREE FLOW OF BOTH GOOD AND INFORMATION. WHAT WE HAVE ABUNDANT ACCESS TO PRODUCTS OF ALL SORT FROM BUILDING MATERIALS TO TOYS AND COSMETICS WE STILL HAVE ALMOST NO INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT GOES INTO THEM? IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE. THAT THIS IGNORANCE OFTEN GOES BEYOND THE CONSUMER. TO ACTUALLY THE BRANDS AND RETAILERS THEMSELVES WHO STRUGGLE TO IDENTIFY AND MANAGE POTENTIAL CHEMICALS OF CONCERN. IN THE PAST TEN YEARS MANY BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN WORKING TO SECURE INGREDIENT LEVEL INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRODUCTS THEY SELL. DESPITE RELATIVELY WEAK REGULATORY MANDATES WE'RE SEEING BRANDS AND RETAILERS CREATING THEIR OWN CHEMICAL TRANSPARENCY IN DISCLOSURE POLICIES THE GO FAR BEYOND ANY REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. I'VE INCLUDED IN THE TESTIMONY BELOW EXAMPLES OF JUST. KIND OF THE LARGEST RETAILERS OF WHAT THEY'VE DONE IN THE LAST YEAR AND THE LIST GOES ON AND ON INITIATIVES LIKE MINE THE STORE. HAVE HELPED CREATE ACCOUNTABILITY AND CREATE A SENSE OF COMPETITION AMONG RETAILERS TO IMPROVE THEIR GRADES ON THE ON THE SCORING SYSTEM AND ALSO GIVE SHOPPERS A SENSE OF SECURITY. THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING PEOPLE WITH THE SAFEST PRODUCTS. WELL THESE VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURES AND RESTRICTIONS BY BRANDS ARE A GOOD START. MORE MUST BE DONE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION DIRECTLY TO THE CONSUMER. THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT I CAN ORDER A TWENTY FOR MY DAUGHTER ONLINE TRACK THE PACKAGE DOWN TO THE MINUTE IT LEFT THE WAREHOUSE. AND GET A TEXT MESSAGE WHEN IT ARRIVES AT MY DOOR. BUT ONCE I HAVE THE TOY IN HAND I WILL HAVE NO IDEA WHAT MATERIALS DIES PLASTICIZERS OR OTHER CHEMICALS ARE IN IT. HAVE YOU SEEN THAT INGREDIENT LIST ON A TOY A PHD IN CHEMISTRY AND YET I STILL DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION I NEED TO CHOOSE THE SAFEST PRODUCT FOR MY THREE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER. WE ARE OFTEN TOLD THAT THIS INFORMATION IS A TRADE SECRET OR THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE DISCLOSED BECAUSE CONSUMERS WILL NOT KNOW HOW TO INTERPRET THE INFORMATION. THE REALITY IS. THAT BOTH ARGUMENTS COULD HAVE BEEN MADE FOR FOOD PACKAGING AS WELL. BUT WE'VE SEEN THAT ACCESS TO THIS SORT OF INFORMATION CREATES A WHOLE ECOSYSTEM OF EDUCATION AND COMPETITION WERE GOVERNMENT BRANDS AND CONSUMER EDUCATION ALL WORK TO CONTINUE TO RAISE THE BAR NUTRITION. AND COULD DO THE SAME. ON THE HEALTH OF THE CHEMICALS WE FIND OUR PRODUCTS. IN THE ABSENCE OF GOOD CHEMICAL INFORMATION WE WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON BANDS AND POORLY DEFINED CLAIMS THAT MAY BE MISLEADING TO THE CONSUMER WHICH BRINGS US TO THE SECOND GAP THAT WAS IDENTIFIED. IN ADDITION TO GREATER CHEMICAL TRANSPARENCY IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE HAVE. OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS THAT ENSURE THE CONSUMERS ARE GETTING USEFUL INFORMATION. LET'S START BY THINKING BACK TO THE EXAMPLE OF THE TOY THAT I BOUGHT. JUST FOR MY DAUGHTER IF IT'S A QUOTE UNQUOTE GREEN TôI THE PACKAGE MAY TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT ISN'T IN THE TOY WITH ASSURANCES LIKE BPA FREE ORGANIC NATURAL OR CHEMICAL FREE MY FAVORITE. THESE LABELS DO LITTLE TO ASSURE ME. THAT THE TôI IS SOMETHING I WANT TO GIVE TO MY CHILD. AS THE CHEMIST I KNOW IF I CAN HOLD IN MY HAND IT'S MADE FROM CHEMICALS. BUT WHAT THEY ARE I CAN'T BE SURE OF IF THE LABEL SAYS NATURAL THAT MADE TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT THE SOURCE OF RAW MATERIALS USED TO MANUFACTURE THE TOY BUT IT DOESN'T GUARANTEE THEIR SAFETY OR THAT THEY WERE PROCESS WITHOUT HARMING PEOPLE OR THE ENVIRONMENT. EVEN THE TERM ORGANIC A THIRD PARTY CERTIFICATION TELLS ME LITTLE MORE THAN HOW THE RAW MATERIALS USUALLY COTTON. OR IN THE CASE OF TOWARDS OUR CLOTHES WERE GROWN IT DOESN'T TELL ME ANYTHING ABOUT THE DICE FINISHES OR OTHER CHEMICALS ADDED TO MAKE THE FINAL PRODUCT. SIMILARLY MANY PRODUCTS LABELED BPA FREE DON'T MENTION THE CHEMICALS THAT ARE IN THE TOY THE COULD BE JUST AS HARMFUL AS THE ONES THAT WERE LEFT OUT. INSTEAD OF BPA IT MAY HAVE BEEN MADE WITH AND BE PS WHICH STUDIES HAVE SHOWN COULD BE JUST AS DANGEROUS. THERE'S NO WAY OF KNOWING THESE REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTION HAPPEN MORE OFTEN THAN WE'D LIKE. BECAUSE WHEN WE BàN SPECIFIC CHEMICALS THE EASIEST SOLUTIONS ARE DROPPING SUBSTITUTES WHICH ARE LIKELY COMPOUNDS WITH SIMILAR STRUCTURES THE COULD HAVE SIMILAR HEALTH CONSEQUENCES. SAFER MADE WAS CREATED TO ENSURE THAT HAS IT IS THAT AS HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS ARE PHASED OUT. THERE WILL BE A PIPELINE A VIABLE SAFER ALTERNATIVES. IT'S SAFER MADE WE'VE DEVELOP STRATEGIES TO IDENTIFY. IN SUPPORT INHERENTLY SAFER CHEMICALS AND PRODUCTS. FIRST WE TAKE A FUNCTIONAL APPROACH TO IDENTIFYING SAFER CHEMICALS. A FUNCTIONAL APPROACH REFOCUSES CHEMICAL MANAGEMENT FROM THE RISKS OF A SINGLE CHEMICAL TO VALUE WAITING ALL THE AVAILABLE OPTIONS TO DELIVER A PARTICULAR FUNCTION. THIS FUNCTIONAL APPROACH COMES FROM A SIMPLE RECOGNITION. PEOPLE DON'T BUY CHEMICALS. THEY PAY FOR FUNCTION. PEOPLE DON'T WANT PERFLUORINATED SURFACTANTS THAT ARE KNOWN TO PERSIST IN THE ENVIRONMENT FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. BUT THEY DO LIKE HAVING OVER BREATHABLE RAIN JACKET TO KEEP THEM DRY. A FUNCTIONAL APPROACH ENCOURAGES MATERIALS AND SYSTEM LEVEL CHANGE THAT PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS BOTH THE CHEMICAL CHALLENGES AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL SUSTAINABILITY IN GOALS. INCLUDING THE REDUCTION OF ENERGY AND WATER USE. THE OTHER THING THAT WE DO IT SAFER MADE TO AVOID REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTION IS TAKE A CLASS APPROACH. WE LOOK AT CHEMICALS OF CONCERN AS MEMBERS OF A LARGER CHEMICAL FAMILIES WHICH ARE LIKELY TO SHARE SOME OF THE SAME. PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES CHEMICALS THAT FALL INTO KNOWN CLASSES OF CONCERN LIKE THIS FINALS ARE PERFORMED AIDED SUBSTANCES SHOULD HAVE TO PASS A HIGHER BAR FOR SAFETY BEFORE BEING USED. GROUPING CHEMICALS BY CLASS BASED ON CHEMICAL STRUCTURE IN PHYSICAL PROPERTIES IS SOMETHING THAT CHEMISTS OFTEN DO QUICKLY TO EVALUATE. A NEW CHEMICAL GROUPING CHEMICALS OF CONCERN BY CLASS HELPS US MAKE SENSE OF THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CHEMICALS THAT WERE MENTIONED IN THE EARLIER REMARKS. AND ALLOWS US TO AVOID WASTING TIME. THIS BRINGS ME TO MY FINAL AREA OF COMMON. WHICH IS HOW DO WE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO CONTINUE LEADING IN EDUCATION AND INNOVATION. INCREASED TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY BOTH CREATE DEMAND. NOW WE WILL SHIFT OUR ATTENTION TO THE WAYS THAT WE CAN GROW THE SUPPLY OF C. FOR CHEMICALS AND PRODUCTS. THE GOOD NEWS IS THE CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS THE EDUCATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE INDUSTRIES AN INNOVATION ECOSYSTEM TO SUPPORT AND ACCELERATE THE INNOVATION OF SAFER CHEMISTRY. CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO THE TOP SCHOOLS FOR STUDYING CHEMISTRY IN THE NATION INCLUDING THREE OF THE TOP. FIVE ACCORDING TO THE US NEWS AND WORLD REPORT. CALIFORNIA'S HOME TO WITH THREE BILLION DOLLAR CHEMICAL INDUSTRY AS WELL AS MANY LEADING BRANDS SOME OF WHICH ARE IN THE ROOM. CALIFORNIA ATTRACTS MORE VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDING THAN ALL OTHER STATES -- COMBINED REGULARLY ATTRACTING OVER HALF OF ALL VENTURE DOLLARS TO BACK EARLY STAGE STARTUPS ACROSS SECTORS. CLEARLY WE HAVE ALL THE BUILDING BLOCKS NEEDED TO LEAD THE NATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF CHEMISTRY THAT'S BETTER FOR HUMAN HEALTH AND THE NATURAL WORLD. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO FOCUS MORE OF THESE RESOURCES ON GREEN CHEMISTRY THE BIGNESS TECHNOLOGY TEN OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAVE TO IMPROVE HUMAN HEALTH. AND THE NATURAL WORLD. TO CREATE SAFER MATERIALS AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS INNOVATORS ENTREPRENEURS AND INVESTORS PRODUCT DEVELOPERS MARKETERS RESEARCHERS AND SCIENTISTS WILL BE HELPED BY. THE FOLLOWING THINGS. A COMMON LANGUAGE TO ADEQUATELY DESCRIBE THE INNOVATION OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN EACH SECTOR. A CLEAR SIGNAL FROM GOVERNMENT INDUSTRY AND NGOS ABOUT WHAT INNOVATION IS NEEDED. AND PARTNERSHIP MODELS THAT ILLUSTRATE HOW PREFERRED CHEMISTRIES AND PRODUCTS CAN BE BROUGHT TO MARKET. AS AN INVESTOR IN SAFER CHEMISTRY MATERIALS I OFTEN FIND MYSELF DESCRIBING THE GREEN CHEMISTRY INNOVATION OPPORTUNITY TO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE NEED FOR SAFER CHEMICALS. FINDING THE RIGHT LEVEL FOR THIS CONVERSATION IS IMPORTANT. THE BEST WAY TO MAKE THE NEED FOR SAFER CHEMISTRY INNOVATION CLEAR IS TO FOCUS ON SPECIFIC CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES IN EACH SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY. THE CHEMISTRY IN PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS ARE VASTLY DIFFERENT FOR MATERIALS USED IN CLOTHING COMPARED WITH SAY SHAMPOO OR BUILDING PRODUCTS ALL TOO OFTEN WE START AT THE END AND FIND THE BAD ACTOR CHEMICALS. WE NEED TO START AT THE BEGINNING AND FIGURE OUT TO FILL AND HOW DO WE FILL THEM IN A BETTER WAY. THE BEST WAY. WITHIN IN EACH INDUSTRY YOU WILL FIND THAT THERE ARE KNOWN CHEMICALS OF CONCERN THAT CURRENTLY PROVIDE IMPORTANT IN USE OUR MANUFACTURING FUNCTIONS. AND THAT THE COMPANIES MAKING THOSE PRODUCTS WOULD BE WILLING TO CHANGE IF. COMPETITIVE ALTERNATIVES WERE AVAILABLE. THE IDENTIFICATION OF PRIORITY PRODUCTS BY DTS SEE TAKES IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN THIS DIRECTION. BUT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE. TO IDENTIFY AND PRIDE CAST SPECIFIC INNOVATION NEEDS TO A MUCH BROADER AUDIENCE AND BROADER INDUSTRY SECTORS [inaudible] SO. WHAT WE'VE DECIDED AS A BENEFIT WITH THOSE NEEDS ARE IT TAKES A CLEAR SIGNAL? BECAUSE THERE ARE LOTS OF RESOURCES AND TIME NEEDED TO INNOVATE. AND TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF TO HAVE THE BEST WAY TO UNLOCK THE CREATIVE POTENTIAL. THAT IS BEHIND GREEN CHEMISTRY IT'S INTERESTING TO FOCUS ON SOMETHING THAT'S IN THE NEWS TODAY. FOOD PACKAGING PLASTIC POLLUTION MARINE PLASTIC POLLUTION. THINK ABOUT ALL OF THE WAYS. THAT ARE BEING ALL THE ACTIONS BEING TAKEN BY ADVOCACY GROUP STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND BUSINESSES THAT ARE DRIVING INNOVATION IN THIS SECTOR AND HOW WE CAN XCELERATED. PEOPLES ARE ALREADY SEEKING SAFER PACKAGING AVOIDING. METAL CANS BECAUSE OF BITS FROM AWAY PAPER CUPS OR AVOIDING PLASTIC CUPS BECAUSE OF POLY STYRENE OR OTHER PLASTICIZERS WANTS INFORMATION ABOUT. THESE MATERIALS A CONCERN IS PUBLIC IT IS NO LONGER ENOUGH TO BE COMPLIANT WITH FDA GUIDANCE ON FOOD CONTACT MATERIALS. LIKE TOSCO BEFORE IT THE FDA GUIDANCE AND FOOD CONTACT MATERIALS IS NO LONGER SUFFICIENT. I PREDICT THAT WE WILL BE SEEING THE PACKAGE FOOD INDUSTRY ADOPT VOLUNTARY RESTRICTED STANDARD SIMILAR TO WHAT I OUTLINED IN. THE RETAILERS AND BRANDS RUMORS ARE DEMANDING IT. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT LIKE THERE ARE SIMILAR WAYS THAT. ADVOCACY GROUPS LIKE THE OWN MACARTHUR FOUNDATION WHO MANAGED TO GET OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING PRODUCTION SIGN A PLEDGE TO ELIMINATE PLASTIC. AND THERE'S ALSO BEEN A NUMBER OF STATE AND LOCAL ACTIONS TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF PACKAGING USED INCLUDING. RESTRICTIONS HERE IN CALIFORNIA THESE PRESSURES SET THE STAGE FOR ADOPTION OF NEW PACKAGING MATERIALS DESIGNS AND BUSINESS MODELS THAT WILL PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH CONVENIENCE AND BENEFITS OF SINGLE USE PACKAGING WITHOUT THE UNINTENDED HARM. SEE FOR MADE IS ACTUALLY MADE TO INVESTMENTS IMPACTING COMPANIES BOTH LOCATED HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- AND IT'S BECAUSE THERE IS THIS SORT OF AWARENESS. SO I'D LIKE TO END WITH THE IMPORTANCE OF PARTNERSHIP. ACTIVE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN BRANDS AND RETAILERS ON ONE SIDE RESEARCH ENTERS AND INNOVATORS ON THE OTHER HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BRING NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO MARKET. THAT HAVE BOTH SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE AND SAFETY. CONNECTING STUDENTS AND RESEARCHERS WITH ORGANIZATIONS LOOKING FOR STUDENT OUT FOR SAFER CHEMISTRY CAN HAVE A PROFOUND IMPACT ON ALL EVERYONE INVOLVED ONE EXAMPLE THE GREENER SOLUTIONS PROGRAM YOU SEE BERKELEY. SHOWS HOW UNIVERSITIES PLAYING AN ACTIVE ROLE IN PROMOTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF SAFER CHEMISTRY CAN HAVE AN IMPACT. IN THEIR PROGRAM INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAMS OF THREE TO FIVE STUDENTS WORK WITH HOST ORGANIZATIONS. TO FIND WAYS TO ADOPT SAFER CHEMISTRY FOR THE DESIGN MANUFACTURE AND USE OF PRODUCTS. THAT PROJECT BASED COURSE DRAWS GRADUATE STUDENTS FROM ACROSS THE CAMPUS AND STUDENTS OF PROVIDED GUIDANCE FOR ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING LEVIS METHOD SEVENTH GENERATION PATAGONIA AUTODESK AN H. P.. AND SOME OF THESE PROJECT OF TURN INTO ONGOING RESEARCH COLLABORATION TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES WHICH MAY BE LICENSE FROM THE UNIVERSITY SOME DAY. IN A NUMBER OF INSTANCES THE STUDENTS WENT ON TO WORK WITH WITHIN THE FIELD OF SAFER CHEMISTRY INCLUDING GRADUATES WHO WORK HERE DTS SEE CRADLE TO CRADLE THE USDA HEWLETT PACKARD AND GUNS WERE. XCELERATED INCUBATORS AND EARLY STAGE INVESTMENT FUNDS ALL PROVIDE PLATFORMS INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOUNG COMPANIES TO SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS AND ALSO FOR BRANDS TO KEEP UP TO DATE WITH NEW TECHNOLOGIES. AND SHARE THEIR INNOVATION PRIORITIES THIS TWO WAY COLLABORATION CAN GUIDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO MAKE THEM MORE COMPATIBLE WITH INDUSTRY NEEDS AND ACCELERATE THEIR DEPLOYMENT. THERE ARE GOVERNMENT FUNDED ORGANISATIONS ALREADY SUPPORTING THE SORT OF WORK HERE IN CALIFORNIA A FEW THAT I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION ARE THE USDA LABORATORY -- WHICH SUPPORTS B#O BASED MATERIALS THAT LOS ANGELES CLEAN TECH INCUBATOR. AND TO THE COW RECYCLE LOAN PROGRAM WHICH AND IS THE RE USE OF RECYCLED PRODUCTS. SAFER MADE IS WORKED WITH ALL OF THEM AND HIS WORK WITH START UP TO BENEFITTED FROM THEIR SUPPORT BUT THE AMOUNT OF SUPPORT GIVEN TO THESE ORGANIZATIONS IS MINUSCULE WHEN COMPARED TO SIMILAR AT EFFORTS AND BIOTECHNOLOGY AND ENERGY RESEARCH. I HOPE THAT I'VE CONVINCED YOU THAT THERE IS BOTH A CLEAR DEMAND FOR SAFER CHEMISTRY AS WELL AS A GROWING SUPPLY OF SAFER PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS. PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO WAKE UP TOMORROW AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT. A LITTLE BIT OF CARCINOGEN IS OKAY AND MY KIDS TOYS TODAY. IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN. SO OUR FOCUS NEED TO BE WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE THE TRANSITION TO HEALTHIER CHEMISTRY AND SAFER PRODUCTS HAPPEN FASTER AND HAPPEN IN A WAY THAT BRINGS BENEFITS TO ALL CONSUMERS. SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE INTO THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF PRODUCTION AND COMMENSURATE INVESTMENT WILL BE NEEDED TO TRANSITION US TO A CLEANER ECONOMY. IS A GREAT TIME TO BE WORKING AND LEADING ON THIS ISSUE EVEN WHEN RELATIVELY MODEST INVESTMENT IN ACTION CAN MAKE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON THE SPEED INTRODUCTORY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF SAFER CHEMISTRY. I HOPE THAT YOU ARE EXCITED TO JOIN ME IN ACCELERATING A FUTURE FOR CALIFORNIA THAT IS SAFER. AND MORE PROSPEROUS FOR US IN MORE IMPORTANTLY OUR CHILDREN THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT WILL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS I'M SURE. A DOCTOR MOBILE HELL BUT I WANT TO SAY HOW EXCELLENT YOUR TESTIMONY WISE AND FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS -- TO LOOK AT A WRITTEN COPY OF THE TESTIMONY I IT IS ON THE WEBSITE IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY AND TOXIC MATERIALS -- WEBSITE SO YOU CAN GET IN THERE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BRIAN DOLLY. WHO IS MY FAVORITE -- EXPRESSION FOR HIM IS THAT FROM HIM IS THAT HE IS ENVIRONMENTALIST BECAUSE HE IS A FARMER. AND FARMERS REALLY HAVE TO PROTECT THE LAND. WOULD YOU LIKE. TO SAY A WORD TO THANK YOU FOR THE KIND WORDS IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK ON THE COMMITTEE I SERVED FIVE YEARS ON THE COMMITTEE TOOK A BREAK LAST YEAR AND I'M REALLY GLAD TO BE BACK IN. GET IN THE MIDDLE OF THINGS THAT THAT WE ALL CARE ABOUT AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. ALL RIGHT -- SO -- SENATORS -- YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY GUY HAD -- SENATOR YEAH I JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU GO WHAT WHAT HOW HOW DO YOU AND INCORPORATE THE CURRENT REGULATORY FRAMEWORK WHEN YOU'RE MAKING YOUR INVESTMENT DECISIONS HOW HOW DO YOU. HOW DO YOU -- YEAH THAT'S MY QUESTION. NO AND IT PROVIDES A VALUABLE. INFORMATION SO THE FIRST AND EASIEST WAY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. IS WHEN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WENT AHEAD AND IDENTIFIED OVER THIRTY THREE HUNDRED CHEMICALS OF CONCERN RIGHT TO NOT THE PRODUCT CHEMICAL COMBINATIONS BUT THE LIST OF LISTS AS IT WAS CALLED. THAT GIVES US AN EXTERNAL VALIDATION FOR THIS APPROACH IT ALLOWS US TO SAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO INVEST IN ANYTHING THAT USES THESE CHEMISTRIES FOR TALKING ABOUT THE FUTURE. I DON'T CARE WHERE THE RATES WERE PRIORITIES ARE IF THESE HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY CHEMICAL AS CHEMICALS OF CONCERN. WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO THERE -- AND SO I USE LISTS LIKE THE WITH OUR INNOVATORS AND SAY HEY IF YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING IN THIS AREA UNITE NEED TO NOT ONLY USE ANY OF THESE CHEMICALS. I ALSO INCORPORATE THE CLASS BASED APPROACH AND SAY YOU CAN'T USE ANY CHEMICALS THAT ARE. IN THE CLASS OF THESE CHEMICALS THAT ARE ON THIS LIST SO I TAKE THAT LIST AS A STARTING PLACE. AND THEN BROUGHT IT USING THE CLASS APPROACH. WHAT ABOUT SO BUT I GUESS MY I'M. TOTALLY GET THAT AND THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE GIVEN GIVEN YOUR WHAT YOU DO. BUT BROADLY SPEAKING YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE SOME CHEMICAL WHAT WHAT IS AND WHAT ARE SOME SOME SOME GREEN CHEMICAL PRODUCTS. THAT WILL BE THAT WILL ACTUALLY GROW RIGHT THEY'LL MAKE MONEY THAT -- YOU KNOW WITHOUT GETTING TOO MUCH IN YOUR BUSINESS MODEL. ARE YOU ARE YOU. ARE YOU SORT OF TRYING TO ANTICIPATE WHERE GOVERNMENTS WILL GO. IN GREATER REGULATION. AND WHERE YOUR SENSE OF THE PRODUCT. DEMAND WILL BE IN THE FUTURE IS THAT YOU HAVE TO KIND OF CREATED A COMPLICATED MATRIX THAT INCORPORATES ALL THOSE THINGS. WE DO AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THERE IN A RELATED. RIGHT SO WE FOLLOW THE CONSUMER. THE CONSUMER FOLLOWS THE INFORMATION THAT'S AVAILABLE TO THEM SOMETIMES THROUGH ADVOCACY GROUP SOMETIMES THROUGH REGULATORY AGENCIES. AND THE BRANDS AND AND RETAILERS TO ME -- FOLLOW THOSE THOSE MARKET SIGNALS SO WE DO TRY TO LOOK INTO THE FUTURE AND SAY WHERE. IS THE CONSUMER MOVING AND LIKE I SAID IT IT OFTEN STARTS WITH FOOD RIGHT AND THEN IT MOVES FROM FOOD TO PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS AND FROM THAT. TO TEXTILES IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT. AND FOR EXAMPLE THE WIN CALIFORNIA NAMED -- THE POLYURETHANE FOAM AS A PRODUCT CHEMICAL COMBINATION WITH MD I THE WAY I LOOK AT THAT AS A SIGNAL THAT POLYURETHANE EXPRESSLY USED IN CONSUMER PLACES IS. NOT A LONG TERM VIABLE ANSWER FOR INSULATION SO THAT. EVEN THOUGH CALIFORNIA'S ONLY LOOKING AT THE PARTICULAR CHEMICAL PRODUCT COMBINATION IT TELLS ME THAT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHIFT INSULATION MATERIALS. AND CONSUMERS ARE AKC ASKING THAT QUESTION. SO YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT THERE IS A A MATRIX OF INTERPLAY HERE WHERE GOVERNMENT ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS AND BUSINESS ALL PLAY A PART TO DRIVE THE DEMAND. AND WHERE WE SHOULD FOCUS IS ON THAT SIDE OF THINGS IF YOU START WITH THE CHEMICAL COMPANIES THEMSELVES THEY WILL ALWAYS TELL YOU EVERY TIME. THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE AND THAT WE HAVE TO DO WHAT WE DO TODAY AND THEY DO THAT NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE BAD THOSE CAMPS ARE GREAT PEOPLE THEY DO THAT BECAUSE THEY'VE INVESTED IN AMORTIZE THEIR ASSETS OVER. LONG TIME FRAMES SO SHIFTING IT'S HARD IF YOU'RE AT THAT PART OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN. IF YOU'RE TOWARDS THE CONSUMER INTO THE SUPPLY CHAIN GET OUT AROUND THE WORLD WHERE WHERE DO YOU THINK WHICH WHICH JURISDICTION YOU THINK -- IS IS IS THE BEST IN THIS AREA WHAT WHERE SHOULD WE BE LOOKING. FOR GUIDANCE AND AND HOW TO GO POLICY WISE IN THE COMMISSARY. VERY HELPFUL WITH A THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS -- THE REACH PROCESS THAT PROVIDES A BASS LINE LEVEL OF INFORMATION. FOR CHEMICALS ENTERING THE MARKET PLACE THAT. IN MY OPINION THAT MODEL PROVIDING. A BASELINE OF SAFETY INFORMATION. COUPLED WITH MORE ACTION WHICH WE HAVEN'T SEEN TAKEN IN MANY PLACES ON DISCLOSURE OF WHAT'S ACTUALLY IN PRODUCTS ARE THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT THINGS ROLES THE GOVERNMENT COMPLY. SO THAT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHOOSE THE WINNERS AND LOSERS YOU JUST HAVE TO SET THE THE PLAYING FIELD AND SAY THIS IS WITH THE INFORMATION YOU HAVE TO SHARE. AND EVERY OTHER PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE ACTION ACROSS. MY LAST QUITE THAT'S GOOD K. SO DISCLOSURE INFORMATION AND THAT'S AT THE HEART OF THE OF THE SOLOMON -- LATER THE RECOMMENDATIONS I FELT QUESTIONS WHAT DO YOU WISH THE GENERAL PUBLIC HAD A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF IN THIS AREA -- I WISH THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC DID THINK OF NUTRITION AND HEALTH MORE HOLISTICALLY SO THAT IT ISN'T JUST THE FOOD WE EAT IN THE ACTIONS WE TAKE. IT IS ALL OF THE PRODUCTS THAT WE BRING INTO OUR HOME THIS IS PART. OF A MUCH BROADER CONVERSATION ABOUT HEALTH -- AND I THINK WE SHOULD TREAT IT THAT WAY IF YOU LOOK AT CANCER OFTEN PEOPLE THINK CANCER IS -- EITHER GENETICALLY LINKED OR CONCORD ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS WHAT ARE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS ITS DIET IT'S OUT LIFESTYLE ACTIVITY AND IT'S THE CHEMICALS THAT ARE IN YOUR DAILY LIFE. RIGHT WE NEED TO THINK OF THIS AS A AS A PART OF OUR NUTRITION AND WELLNESS THAT'S HOW. AND I ACTUALLY SEE THAT IN TWO WAYS BECAUSE USUALLY WHAT I FIND IS EITHER CONSUMERS KNOW NOTHING OR THEIR NEW PARENT AND THEY'RE AFRAID OF EVERYTHING. LIKE THERE'S VERY FEW THINGS IN THE MIDDLE. THE REALITY IS WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE ZERO HARM PRODUCTS I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK THAT'S POSSIBLE. BUT IF YOU WE HAVE EDU IF WE CAN MAKE EDUCATED DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT IS HEALTHIEST FOR US WHAT ARE THE BEST THINGS TO BRING INTO OUR HOUSE SO WE CAN TRADE OFF PERFORMANCE FOR POTENTIAL HARM. RIGHT NOW WE CAN'T DO THAT -- AND THAT'S A PROBLEM -- JUST A SECOND I'M GONNA INTRODUCE ASSEMBLY MEMBER AL MURATSUCHI ANOTHER -- PERSON VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT WE HAD MANY DISCUSSIONS OVER THE YEARS WHERE HE HAS BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE WITH ME -- DID YOU WANT TO MAKE ANY INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. THAT HAVE -- INTERACT REMARKS BUT I DID HAVE QUESTIONS EIGHT YOU KNOW OKAY WELL WE'LL GO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER DOLLY AND THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI AND THEN ANYONE ELSE. SO I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THE SENATOR'S COMMENTS SO IT YOU KNOW AS LEGISLATORS WE ARE FACED WITH. A LOT OF DECISIONS AM AND WHEN WE PUT SOMETHING INTO LAW. IT CHANGES THE PLAYING FIELD DRASTICALLY SALAMI ARMS WILL DROP FISHER SO I I SERVED ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS FOR SIXTEEN YEARS. AND WE HAD A COMMUNITY THAT ONE TO FLOOR NATE THEIR WATER. OKAY TO SAVE CAVITIES FOR CHILDREN. BASICALLY -- WHO WEREN'T? DOING G.. AND MAY TAKE SOME THAT CREATED OF TSUNAMI OF OPINIONS ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD BE FORTY OUR WATER WHICH IS CAN CAN KILL YOU. THE CHEMICAL RIGHT SOME WOULD SAY THAT AND WHICH WE GET PAID OPINIONS ON ALL SIDES. AND WE HAVE TO ACTUALLY MAKE GOOD DECISIONS UPON THOSE OPINIONS IN AND STE ONE SIDE IS ON ONE SIDE ONE SIDE IS ON THE OTHER ONE DENTIST ON THE SIDE ONE ON THE SITE. AND WE HAVE THE FAMILIES IN BETWEEN. SO. I WOULD LIKE TO IN AND IN WHAT YOU SAID I HEARD EARLIER ABOUT YOU KNOW THE MARKET DRIVES. THE CONSUMER TO DO CERTAIN THINGS BASED OFF OF WHAT THEY KNOW. SO. FOR ME IT BE VERY HELPFUL. IF IN THESE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE HAVE IN IN THIS COMMITTEE TO COME UP ALL THE TIME OF OF ONE VERSUS THE OTHER AND WHAT'S THE PUBLIC BENEFIT VERSUS THE PERSONAL. CHOICE THAT YOU WANT HAVE AND SO HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU YOU GIVE US AS LEGISLATORS. A BOUNDARY OF HOW WE ENGAGE IN THOSE IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND ACTUALLY. GIVE. PERSONAL CHOICE AND AND ALSO PROTECT THE PUBLIC AT THE SAME TIME. YEAH I MEAN THAT IS. THE TRICKY BALANCE TO WALK AND I THINK THE SAFE PLACES TO WALK IN MY OPINION ARE AROUND. TRANSPARENCY AND INFORMATION DISCLOSURE THESE ARE PLACES WHERE WE SEE WE IT WAS FUN TO BE WORKING WITH COMPANIES AS DTS DTS C. ROLLED OUT THEIR FIRST THREE PRIORITY PRODUCTS. THREE PRIORITY PRODUCTS RIGHT. I SAW INDUSTRIES ALL OVER BEING WORRIED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE ONE OF THE THREE AND PRO ACTIVELY REMOVING CHEMICALS OF CONCERN THAT WERE ON THAT LIST OF TWENTY THREE HUNDRED OR THIRTY THREE HUNDRED AT THE TIME -- THEY WERE ACTING PROACTIVELY BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT THE TARGET PUT ON THEM RIGHT AND THAT TARGET IS JUST AN INFORMATION TARGET IT'S NOT EVEN A BAND. RIGHT -- SO I THINK IN THIS AREA OF CHEMICALS IN PARTICULAR INFORMATION IS OUR MOST POWERFUL TOOL. AND WORSE SO FAR AWAY FROM THE SATURATION POINT OF THE INFORMATION THAT SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE THAT THAT IS A SAFE PLACE THAT WILL BOTH HAVE POSITIVE IMPACT. ARM AND NOT BE CHOOSING WINNERS OR LOSERS. RIGHT ARM I THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE CASES PROBABLY WHEN THERE IS ENOUGH DATA FOR DTS SEE ANOTHER TO TAKE REGULATORY ACTION THEY SHOULD HAVE THAT AUTHORITY. WRITES THAT COMES WITH ART ONCE YOU'VE MADE THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE THEY SHOULD HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ACT. BUT I ACTUALLY THINK THAT IN THE NEAR TERM IS THE MOST POWERFUL TOOL WE HAVE. FINANCE YOUR QUESTION NOT ENOUGH [inaudible] NOT QUITE. I WOULD SUPPORT FOR NATION WATER BASED ON THE SCIENCE IS OUT THERE BUT THAT WASN'T A QUESTION LIKELY. IT -- YEAH IT IS HARD BRIAN I UNDERSTAND AND I JUST WANT TO MAYBE JUST THAT MORE OF JUST A COMMENT IS THAT. NO PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF OF WHOEVER'S ON WHATEVER POWER BROKER OR WHATEVER MEDIA'S PUSHING OR WHATEVER GROUP IS TRYING TO SELL SOMETHING THAT DEPENDS ON HOW GOOD OF A JOB MARKETING THEIR PRODUCT. TO PUT THE SCARE OR THE YOU KNOW THERE'S A MEAN EVERYTHING CAUSES CANCER IN THE LIST IS VERY DEEP AND LONG AND WHITE -- BUT YOU KNOW I GO BACK TO SOMETHING THAT THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS AND MOST OF US THERE'S NO THAT YOU KNOW THERE IS THIS. WE SHOULD NEVER CUT A TREE IN THE FOREST BECAUSE IT WAS THE WRONG THING TO DO WHEN WE SHOULD BE CUTTING TREES AND SO BECAUSE THE PUBLIC DIDN'T UNDERSTAND. THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT DOING SOMETHING SO I TRY TO THAT'S WHY I'M LOOKING FOR IS THAT BALANCE OF AND WE HAVE THOSE DECISIONS MAKE IN THEIR HARD DECISION TO MAKE WHEN YOU HAVE. YOUR WHOLE CONSTITUENTS I MEAN WE WE WENT THROUGH. SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE VACCINATIONS WHETHER YOU SHOULD VACCINATE OR NOT ACTING I MEAN TRUST ME. YOU CAN GET VERY OF ME ALMOST GET KNOCKED OUT YOUR OFFICE FROM SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. AND WE'RE WE'RE MAKING DECISIONS UPON THEIR CHILDREN'S LIVES AND WHEN IT BECOMES A MOTIONAL AND DRIVEN. IT'S IT'S SO I I'M TRYING TO FIND A PLACE WE NATION WITHOUT ALL THE HYPE. SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY TAKE THE TIME TO READ THE INFORMATION. FROM EXPERTS WHO HAVE A NON BIAS. OPINION ON THIS IS THE FAX THEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY MAKE A DECISION THAT IS EDUCATED AND CLOSE TO AS GOOD AS IT'S GONNA GET. YEAH. I THINK -- MY OTHER ANSWER TO AN EARLIER QUESTION THAT RELATES TO WHAT YOU JUST SAID IS. I WISH THE PUBLIC HAD A GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF UNCERTAINTY. AND THE FACT THAT WE ARE GOING TO NEED TO MAKE DECISIONS TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION. EVEN WHEN WE DON'T HAVE A 100% CERTAINTY AND THAT IS WHAT'S HARD ABOUT THIS HE'S ARE COMPLEX. INTER RELATED QUESTIONS WHICH MEANS THAT AS A SCIENTIST I HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THERE'S A FAIRLY LARGE UNCERTAINTY. AND SO I THINK ANOTHER WAY TO FRAME YOUR CHALLENGES HOW DO YOU MAKE DECISIONS AND ACT. IN THE FACE OF UNCERTAINTY AND I THINK THAT IS A IS A COURT CHALLENGE WORKING IN THE SPACE OF CHEMISTRY -- CHAU ASSEMBLY MEMBER DOLLY YES IT'S HARD WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES -- I WILL SAY IN THE CASE OF VACCINATIONS. THE THERE IS A SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS. IN THE CASE OF CLIMATE CHANGE THERE'S A SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS AND THERE'S GOOD REASON FOR THAT. AND I THINK YOU YOU NEED TO RELY UPON THE SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS WHEN THERE ISN'T. ONE ARE BUT THERE ARE OTHER CASES -- WE WERE P. FAST PER FLOOR NATIVE OUT KILL OUTDATED SINCE YES AS YOU SAID. AND THAT THERE WASN'T. THOSE DRUGS AND THERE WASN'T FOR OTHERS. AND THEN IT BECOMES VERY HARD AND THAT'S WHY WE TRIED TO USE THE GAME CHEMISTRY PROCESS. TO LOOK AT THIS WHERE WE WEREN'T SURE WHETHER OR NOT THOSE PARTICULAR CHEMICALS WERE BANNED. AND I THINK ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS ABOUT THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROCESS IS TO TAKE IT OUT OF THE POLITICAL. DISCUSSION AND TRY AND GET IT INTO A SCIENTIFIC BASIS. AND THAT TO ME IS A ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS ABOUT THE GAME CHEMISTRY PROCESS. ALSO THAT WE DON'T AS A DOCTOR MOLLY HILL SAID SIMPLY. PUT ANOTHER CHEMICAL IN THAT MIGHT BE JUST AS BAD AND THAT'S ANOTHER THING -- WE MAY NOT THINK ABOUT IT IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS BUT WITH THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROCESS. THERE MANDATED TO DO THAT. SO THAT'S THE REASON WHY TRUST THAT OVER US JUST LEGISLATING -- MISTER MURATSUCHI THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF HI I WAS LISTENING TO YOUR TESTIMONY ON THE THE DAY THAT THE TV THAT TO AND SO I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS ESPECIALLY AS A A A NEW PARENT -- AND AND YOUR COMMENT ABOUT HOW WHEN YOU BECOME A PARENT YOU BECOME AFRAID OF EVERYTHING I THINK THAT. TO SOMETHING THAT I CAN REALLY APPRECIATE I CONSUMERS ABOUT UNCERTAINTY BECAUSE I THINK. YOU KNOW -- DID NOT NOT NOT JUST IS IT OF DID DO CONSUMERS -- MAKE CHOICES BASED ON THE INFORMATION IS PROVIDED TO THEM BUT I THINK. VOTERS AND POLITICIANS MAKE CHOICES BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THEM AND SO. YOU KNOW. WHEN THEY'RE? WHEN WHEN WHEN SCIENTISTS SAY THAT THERE IS A LACK OF CONSENSUS ON THE DANGERS OF A CERTAIN CHEMICAL? BUT THAT THERE IS OVERWHELMING PUBLIC PERCEPTION THAT THERE IS A DANGER THEN THAT'S WHEN WE RESPOND AND THAT'S THE WORLD THAT WERE OPERATING IN. AND YOU KNOW I I WANT TO BRING UP THEY THEY EXAMPLE OF OF GLYPHOSATE. YOU KNOW WHERE [inaudible] WE HAVE. IN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION IS SAYING THAT IT'S A PROBLEM CARCINOGEN AND AND AND WE HAVE. IT AND AND YET I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY THEY THE E. YOU JUST EXTENDED THE THE THE THE LEASE FOR THE USE OF OF OF CLIVUS EIGHT AND YET ON THE OTHER HAND WE HAVE. NUMEROUS COUNTRIES THAT HAVE ALREADY BANNED OR WRIST -- RESTRICTED THAT THE USE OF OF CLIVUS SAY. AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW LAST YEAR WE WE HAD -- TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE MILLION DOLLAR JURY VERDICT -- YOU KNOW WELL CHALLENGING THE USE OF OF CLIVUS SATAN SO MY MY POINT IS THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT WHY WE LIKE TO THINK THAT THAT SCIENCE IS THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING I I THINK SCIENCE. YOU NY IS ARE LIKE STATISTICS THAT IT CAN BE USED TO SUPPORT AND SOMEONE SAID -- ONE SIDE'S AGENDA OR THE OTHER -- AND AND SO I I WANT TO HEAR YOUR YOUR THOUGHTS IN A WAY WHEN WHEN THEY'RE THERE SEEMS TO BE COMPETING SCIENTIFIC'S EARNS ABOUT. ABOUT FTA STUDIES BEING UNDERMINED BY INTEREST GROUPS -- YOU KNOW HOW HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DEAL WITH THE UNCERTAINTY AND SCIENCE ITSELF. THERE I I THINK THAT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION ASKING WHY YOU NEED. TEAMS LIKE YOU HAVE A T. T. S. C. WHO ARE THE EXPERTS IN EVALUATING THE QUALITY OF INFORMATION AND STUDIES THAT ARE BEING DONE. AND SO THE WHAT THE WAY I THINK OF THE QUESTION IN AN ISSUE YOU JUST BROUGHT UP IS. BASICALLY A HOW MUCH OF AN INDICATOR EARLY INDICATOR DO YOU HAVE NEED TO HAVE OF A POTENTIAL. PARTNER RIGHT BECAUSE WHEN WE LIVE IN SUCH A COMPLEX SOCIETY. EXPOSED TO SO MANY DIFFERENT CHEMICALS IDENTIFYING THAT A SINGLE BAD ACTOR AT A SINGLE EXPOSURE. IS GOING TO CAUSE A PROBLEM IT'S KIND OF LIKE SAYING I GOT CANCER BECAUSE A ONE TWENTY WE DON'T KNOW THAT BUT IF YOU HAVE A HABIT OF EATING TWINKIES AND NOT EXERCISING YOUR YOUR LIKELIHOOD OF HAVING A HEALTH PROBLEM IS IS. HIGHER RIGHT. AND SO. THAT EARLY INDICATOR OF HARM -- IS THE THRESHOLD THAT YOU'RE LOOKING. FOR AND SO. WHERE YOU CHOOSE TO DRAW THAT LINE IS A MORAL JUDGMENT NOT A SCIENTIFIC JUDGMENT AND I THINK THIS IS THAT THE ROOT OF WHAT YOU'RE DRIVING AT? IS HOW MUCH CONSENSUS DO YOU NEED DO NEED CONSENSUS THAT THIS HAS. THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THINGS THAT ARE KNOWN TO HAVE THESE EFFECTS DO YOU NEED TO KNOW THOSE EFFECTS IN PEOPLE DO YOU NEED TO JUST HAVE SAY THAT -- WELL COMPUTER MODEL SAID THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE A SIMILAR EFFECT THOSE ARE ALL REASONABLE PLACES TO DRAW THE LINE TO SAY THIS IS A POTENTIAL CARCINOGEN DON'T AYE ARC THAT HAS THEIR SET. OF REQUIREMENTS AND IT'S IMPORTANT I THINK PEOPLE MISS THIS ALL THE TIME IT'S NOT THAT SCIENCE CAN BE USED ONE WAY OR THE OTHER ON SCIENCE CAN BE INTERPRETED IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. ALL OF THOSE THRESHOLDS ARE REASONABLE THRESHOLDS. AND THE DATA UNDERLYING IT. SHOULD BE OBJECTIVE BUT WHERE TO DRAW THAT LINE IS A MORAL JUDGMENT AND IT'S NOT AN EASY. ONE AND THAT IS WHAT WE FOR YOU KNOW PUT YOU GUYS IN OFFICE TO DO IS MAKE THOSE MORAL JUDGMENTS WHERE DO YOU DRAW THE LINE -- AND WE AGREE WITH YOU WE VOTE YOU AND WE WE DON'T WE WATCH OUR THANK YOU. THAT WAS AN EXCELLENT ANSWER -- JUST TO TALK ABOUT THE LIFE IS STATE. ONE OF MY FAVORITE TOPICS AS A SCIENTIST AND THERE IS A CONSIGNA THE CONSENSUS IT'S NOT A PROBLEM BUT YOU DO HAVE ONE GROUP SAYING IT IS. ACTUALLY OTHER GROUPS WITHIN THE WHL WORLD HEALTH IT SAYS IT'S NOT A PROBLEM -- IT'S JUST ONE AGENCY BUT THE WAY PROP SIXTY FIVE WORKS TO GETS LABELED WHETHER OR NOT -- ANYONE BELIEVES IT REALLY IS A PROBLEM IT'S JUST THIS WAS THE WAY THEY INITIATIVE WAS WRITTEN. IT GETS LABELED THE NICE THING ABOUT GREEN CHEMISTRY AS IT LETS YOU USE -- THE EXISTING EXPERTISE. AND MAKE A DECISION AS OPPOSED TO JUST ARBITRARILY DECIDING WE'RE GOING TO PUT A LOT LABEL ON THIS BECAUSE ONE AGENCY OUT OF DOZENS HAS DECIDED IT'S PROBLEM -- OTHER QUESTIONS -- IN [inaudible] LET'S SEE. I'M JUST GONNA MAKE A COMMENT WHICH IS THAT. THE CHEMICAL RESIDENT REVOLUTION ARE AND FOR THAT MATTER THE COMPUTER REVOLUTION WHICH HAS ALLOWED US. TO EVALUATE CHEMICALS -- HAS BROUGHT MANY MANY BENEFITS TO ASSAULT WE'RE LIVING LONGER. FOR THE MOST PART ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME AREAS WHERE. IN THIS IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY WHERE PEOPLE ARE LIVING LONGER BUT BY AND LARGE -- WE'RE LIVING LONGER AND IT'S BECAUSE OF THE CHEMISTRY IT'S BECAUSE OF THE BREAKTHROUGHS THAT ARE BEING MADE IN VARIOUS TECHNOLOGY SO IN NET IT'S DEFINITELY A GOOD THING -- BUT WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING DO YOU HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ON THAT IN TERMS OF NOT ONLY HOW TO FIX OUR HEALTH BUT OUR ECONOMY -- DR MOTHER HIM. ABSOLUTELY HAVE LOTS OF THOUGHTS ABOUT CHEMISTRY BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY TO IS THAT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. THAT CHEMISTRY AND MATERIALS BRING US A LOT OF BENEFITS. I THINK. WHAT WE'RE LEARNING AND WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN SHIFTING TOWARDS A SAFER CHEMISTRY SO WE USED TO HAVE? ISSUES OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION THAT WERE EVEN WORSE AND DIFFERENT THAN THE ONES WE HAVE TODAY WE'RE CONSTANTLY MOVING THE LINE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND OUR JOB ISN'T. TO YOU KNOW RETRY ISSUES OF THE PAST IT'S TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE MOVE THAT LINE. IN THE FUTURE TOWARDS SOMETHING THAT IS AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE AS BENEFICIAL AS POSSIBLE AND I THINK THAT IS THE CHALLENGE THAT'S BEFORE US. RATHER THAN THAN RETRYING ANY PARTICULAR ISSUE WHAT I WOULD SAY IS WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY NOW WITH -- GREATER RESOURCE IS TO THINK ABOUT INSTEAD OF JUST USING ALL THE WASTE PRODUCTS FROM THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY TO MAKE OUR MATERIALS WHICH IS WHAT WE DO ABOUT. 98% OF CHEMICALS ARE BY PRODUCTS THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE IF WE STARTED WITH DIFFERENT SOURCES -- WHAT IF WE STARTED WITH CROPS OR WASTE AND RE OPTIMIZE FOR BOTH HEALTH AND FUNCTION AND PERFORMANCE -- SO I GUESS THE THE COMMENT I WOULD. INDY WITH IS DON'T THINK OF CHEMISTRY IS SEPARATE FROM THE OTHER ISSUES YOU THINK ABOUT LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE LIKE RESOURCE USE -- BECAUSE REALLY MAKE EVERYTHING OUT OF ARE AT THE CORE OF A LOT OF THESE IMPACTS -- SO I'D LIKE TO SOMETIMES A JOKE THAT WERE STUCK IN BETWEEN CANCER CLIMATE CHANGE THE NO ONE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT. CHEMISTRY -- ON A GOOD DAY I ACTUALLY THINK THAT WE ARE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN CANCER AND CLIMATE CHANGE SO IF YOU REALLY WANT TO MAKE AN IMPACT. FOCUS ON CHEMISTRY. EXCELLENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU CAN YEAH YOU CAN APPLAUD WHY NOT. SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR EXCELLENT -- CHEMISTRY. CHOOSE FROM YOUR ERIC EXCELLENT PRESENTATION AND GOOD CHEMISTRY -- NEXT I'D LIKE TO INVITE DR MEREDITH WILLIAMS WHO IS THE ACTING DIRECTOR AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE SAFER CAM. CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM AT DTS SEE. WE'VE INVITED DR WILLIAMS TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW THE DEPARTMENTS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM -- NOW DTS SEES BACKGROUND INFORMATION AGAIN IS IN THE E. S. T. M. WEBSITE [inaudible] SO -- DOCTOR WILLIAMS WOULD YOU LIKE TO PROCEED SURE. THANK YOU CHAIR QUIRK. CHAIR ALLEN AND OTHER MEMBERS WHO ARE HERE TODAY TO TO GIVE ATTENTION TO GREEN CHEMISTRY. WE APPRECIATE THE INTEREST AND WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO TALK ABOUT THIS ISSUE -- AND GREEN INDEED YES HE'S GREEN CHEMISTRY WORK. AND SINCE OF COURSE WHERE AT THE FIVE YEAR MARK OF THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS REGULATIONS AND IT'S BEEN TEN YEARS SINCE THE GREEN CHEMISTRY LAWS PASSED IT IS INDEED A GOOD TIME TO TAKE THAT STEP BACK. TAKE STOCK OF THE LAW THE REGULATIONS AND THE DEPARTMENT'S EFFORTS. WE TOOK SOMETIME LAST LAST FALL IN OUR PROGRAM. TO TO CELEBRATE OUR FIFTH BIRTHDAY AND WE'RE GROWING UP FAST BEFORE I GO ANY FURTHER I DO WANT TO IT AT INTRODUCED THE BRANCH CHIEF FOR THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS GRANT BRANCH AND THAT'S CARL PALMER [inaudible] SEVERE FORGIVING. TODAY I'LL BRING YOU UP TO DATE ON DETAILS HE'S WORK TO ESTABLISH THE REGULATIONS CALLED FOR IN AB. EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE AND ALL DESCRIBE WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING WHAT WE'VE DONE TO BUILD A PROGRAM TO IMPLEMENT THOSE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS REGULATIONS. DR MALL THE WHOLE PAINTED A POWERFUL PICTURE OF THE PROGRESS THAT'S BEEN MADE. AND THE INNOVATION OPPORTUNITY. CONSUMERS ARE DEMANDING CHANGE AND COMPANIES ARE RESPONDING. IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS TO REDUCE TOXICS IN PRODUCTS MAY BE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF ANY STATES. TEN YEARS AGO THE LEGISLATURE THE LEGISLATIVE DIGEST FOR EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE INCLUDED THIS STATEMENT. WHAT IS NEEDED IS NOTHING SHORT OF A COMPLETE OVERHAUL OF CURRENT TOXICS POLICY? REPLACING IN EFFECT INEFFECTIVE LAWS WITH POLICIES THAT RELIEVE THE PUBLIC'S BURDEN TO PROVE HARM AFTER THE FACT AND SHIFTED ON TO THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY. TO DEMONSTRATE LACK OF HARM BEFORE. DESPITE THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE PROTECTING CONSUMERS IS AS URGENT AS EVER. JUST SUNDAY NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE LAMENTED THE PRESENCE OF TALL EWING LED AS BEST AS PARABENS AND PHTHALATES IN COSMETICS. FORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA'S LEGISLATURE WRECKED RECOGNIZE THIS THE SHORTFALLS OF CHEMICALS MANAGEMENT AND PUSHED LEGISLATION TO TACKLE THE CHALLENGE. THE GREEN CHEMISTRY INITIATIVE SB FIVE OH NINE EIGHT FEET ABC EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE AND THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS REGULATIONS ALL RECOGNIZE THE SCALE OF THE SEA CHANGE. THAT WAS NEEDED UNFORTUNATELY THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS WERE CRAFTED TO BE AMBITIOUS ENOUGH TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS. AND REALIZE THE BENEFITS. THE GREEN CHEMIST OF THE GREEN CHEMISTRY OPPORTUNITY. MY COMMENTS TODAY WILL FOCUS ON OUR WORK IMPLEMENTING THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS REGULATIONS. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THEY ARE ONLY ONE FACET. OF WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO GET YOU A GREEN CHEMISTRY BASED ECONOMY IN CALIFORNIA. IN THE TEN YEARS SINCE THE LAW PASSED WE'VE BEEN DOING WHAT THE LEGISLATOR AT LEGISLATURE ASKED US TO DO. FIRST WE UNDERTOOK THE DEVELOPMENT OF REGULATIONS THAT WOULD SHIFT THE PARADIGM FOR MANAGEMENT OF TOXIC CHEMICALS. THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF ENGAGEMENT ACROSS THE STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY DURING THE REGULATIONS DEVELOPMENT. AND THAT'S STILL A SIGNATURE OF THE PROGRAM. AS EVIDENCED BY A BROAD SPECTRUM OF SPEAKERS TODAY AND THOSE IN ATTENDANCE. WE ADOPTED REGULATIONS INTENDED TO MOVE AWAY FROM REACTIVE CHEMICAL WHACK A MOLE APPROACH TOWARDS SCIENCE BASED DECISIONS. THAT ARE COMPREHENSIVE IDENTIFY SAFER ALTERNATIVES AND AVOID SHIPS REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTES. THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS REGULATIONS HOLD MANUFACTURERS ACCOUNTABLE. FOR THE SAFETY OF THEIR PRODUCTS BY COMPELLING INDUSTRY TO OFFER SAFER PRODUCTS TO CONSUMERS. IMPORTANTLY ADOPTING THE FORCIBLE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK PROVIDES MORE MARKET CERTAINTY. AN IN AND PROVIDES INCENTIVES FOR CHANGE. CALIFORNIA IS BLESSED WITH COMPANIES WHO ARE COMMITTED TO A SAFER PRODUCTS METHOD HEWLETT PACKARD LEVI APPLE BEAUTY COUNTER AND MANY OTHER COUNTRIES COMPANIES. ARE ALREADY AGGRESSIVELY ELIMINATING TOXIC CHEMICALS IN THEIR PRODUCTS YOU'LL HEAR FROM REPRESENTATIVES OF SOME OF THOSE COMPANIES TODAY. AND I THINK THEY'LL THEY'LL GIVE YOU A PERSPECTIVE OF HOW THEY ARE TACKLING THIS PROBLEM. THE SEP RAPPER REGULATIONS HELP SET A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD SO THAT THOSE TYPES OF COMPANIES THAT MOVE FORWARD. TOWARD SAFER ALTERNATIVES. ARE AT A DISADVANTAGE IN THE MARKET PLACE. THESE OUTCOMES WARRANTED SHIVA BOWL WITH THE HISTORICAL VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS. SUCH AS THE POLLUTION PREVENTION PROGRAM AT THE TSC. WE'VE BUILT THE PROGRAM ON THREE FUNDAMENTAL PILLARS. TO BUILD CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT THE RIGS. TO EXECUTE. AND TO LEAD. SO BY CAPACITY BUILDING WILL I MEAN WE'RE MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE SKILLS THE PROCESSES AND THE SCIENTIFIC RESOURCES. TO IMPLEMENT THIS UNIQUE SET OF REGULATIONS. WE'VE HIRED STAFF WITH NEW AREAS OF EXPERTISE THAT ARE NEEDED TO SUPPORT. OUR WORK WE DEVELOPED PROCESSES TO SUPPORT OUR DECISIONS AND REGULATORY ACTIONS. AND WE'VE ENSURED THAT OUR STAFF HAVE ACCESS TO THE RIGHT TOOLS SUCH IS ACCESS TO RESEARCH AND DATA. BECAUSE THERE WAS NO PRESS PRESIDENT FOR APPROACH WE BUILT MANY OF OUR TOOLS FROM SCRATCH. AND PROCEDURES THE SAME WAY. BUT WE LOOK WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO USE EXISTING RESOURCES AND ADAPT TO THEM FOR THE CALIFORNIA FRAMEWORK. OUR CAPACITY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OUR CAPACITY WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THOSE IN THE DEPARTMENT WE TALK ABOUT THOSE -- BEYOND THE WALLS OF THE DEPARTMENT WE LEVERAGE EXTERNAL. TOOLS AND EXPERTISE EXTENSIVELY AND THAT IS REALLY HELPED US MAKE OUR LIMITED RESOURCES GO FURTHER. MUCH OF OUR CAPACITY BUILDING WAS MADE POSSIBLE WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATURE. WE'VE UNDERTAKEN A FOUGHT FOR EXPANSION OF THE PROGRAM WITH LEGISLATIVE SESSION WERE SUPPORT FOR CERTAIN RESOURCES. WE'VE ASKED FOR NEW STACK OF STAFFING COMMENSURATE WITH WHERE WE ARE ON OUR PROGRESS OF IMPLEMENTING THE REGULATIONS AND OUR CONFIDENCE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT. WE'RE READY TO USE THOSE RESOURCES WISELY AND THAT'S ENABLED US TO COME AS FAR AS WE HAVE. WITH RESPECT TO THE SECOND PILLAR THE EXECUTION PILLAR THAT MEANS WE SIMPLY MUST DO THE NUTS AND BOLTS TASKS THAT ARE DEFINED BY THE REGULATIONS. FOR INSTANCE WORKING TO THE REGULATORY TIME LINES FOR ANNOUNCING THE FIRST PRIORITY PRODUCTS AND THE WORK PLANS. ESTABLISHING THE CANDIDATE CHEMICALS. ISSUING ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS GUIDANCE. AND COMPLETING PRIORITY PRODUCT RULE MAKING. EXECUTION ALSO MEANS SENDING A HIGH STANDARD OF QUALITY. OR TECHNICAL WORK HAS BEEN CONSISTENTLY VALIDATED BY OUR GREEN RIBBON SCIENCE PANEL AND BY EXTERNAL PEER REVIEWERS. LASTLY LEADING THE WAY. AS IS SO OFTEN THE CASE CALIFORNIA MUST PROVIDE ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERSHIP. I THINK THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS THAT BETTER THAN MOST -- DOCTOR MALL THE WHOLE TALKED ABOUT GREEN CHEMISTRY IS A LARGER ECONOMIC TREND. BUT IN ORDER TO REACH A TIPPING POINT. GOVERNMENTMUST PLAY ITS ROLE TO BUILD A NEW MODEL OF INHERENTLY SAFER PRODUCTS DESIGNED PRODUCT DESIGN. THE AND A MODEL THAT FOSTERS INNOVATION AND EMBRACES GREEN CHEMISTRY. WE LEAD BY CALLING FOR ADVANCES IN SCIENCE AND BEING SHORT TO APPLY EMERGING SCIENCE TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF OUR DECISIONS. WE LEAD BY ENGAGING OTHER FORWARD LOOKING GOVERNMENT PARTNERS AT THE LOCAL STATE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVEL. WE HAVE DONE SO AND DERIVE GREAT BRENT BENEFIT FROM MEMORANDA OF UNDERSTANDING WITH OREGON AND WASHINGTON STATE. AND WITH U. S. EPA'S OFFICE OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND OFFICE OF CHEMICAL SAFETY AND POLLUTION PREVENTION. WE ALSO HAVE PARTNERS IN OUR FELLOW REGULATORS IN CANADA AND IN EUROPE. SO WE'VE USE THESE THREE PILLARS TO GUIDE OUR WORK AND ACCOMPLISH A GREAT DEAL. THE SECOND PAGE OF YOUR HAND OUT SHOWS SOME OF THE ACTIONS WE'VE TAKEN ALL HIGHLIGHT A FEW AND MENTION SOME ITEMS THAT AREN'T CAPTURED AND NOT IN THE HANDOUT. WHEN THE START OFF WITH PAINT STRIPPERS WITH METHYLENE CHLORIDE? THIS CHEMICAL IS CARCINOGEN IT'S A CARCINOGEN AND INNER OF TALKS CAN. AND IT IS CAUSED AT LEAST SIXTY FOUR FATALITIES OVER THE LAST DECADES. MEANWHILE DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE DESPITE PLEAS FROM THE FAMILIES OF THOSE WHO DIED USEPA HAS DRAGGED ITS FEET ON TAKING ACTION. WORKERS AND DO IT YOURSELFERS ARE AT RISK AND THEY LET US KNOW THAT DURING THE COMMENT PERIOD. NOW IN RESPONSE TO OUR PRIORITY PRODUCT LISTING MANUFACTURERS ARE ANALYZING. THE SAFETY OF THE ALTERNATIVES. WE HAVE PROPOSED CARPETS AND RUGS WITH PER OR POLY FLORAL ALCOTT SUBSTANCES. AS A PRIORITY PRODUCT THESE P. FAST SUBSTANCES ARE DEVELOPMENTAL AND REPRODUCTIVE TOXICANTS. CHILDREN FROM CRAWL ON RUGS AND SPEND TIME ON THE FLOOR ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO EXPOSURES. ADDITIONALLY. P. FAST ARE EXTREMELY PERSISTENT IN THE ENVIRONMENT. LEADING TO REPEATED EXPOSURES LONG AFTER THE USEFUL LIFE OF OF ANY GIVEN PRODUCT. WE'RE DRESSING THE THOUSANDS OF P. FAST CHEMICALS USING A CLASS APPROACH. WITCH DOCTOR MORE THE WHOLE REFERENCED AND WHICH IS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE REPORT. USING A CLASS APPROACH WE'RE USING A CLASS APPROACH RATHER THAN A CHEMICAL BY CHEMICAL APPROACH. THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT OBJECTIVE OF THE LAW AND OUR REGULATIONS INSURER THAT WE DON'T DO THEIR AROUND WITH ONE CHEMICAL OR TWO CHEMICALS BUT WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THE FULL RANGE OF CHEMICALS IN THIS CLASS. WHICH ALL SHARE -- THE PERSISTENCE ATTRIBUTES. ON ANOTHER FRONT WE'RE GIVING COMPANIES THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO ANALYZE ALTERNATIVES TO STOP THE BLIND SUBSTITUTION OF ONE BAD CHEMICAL FOR ANOTHER. OUR GREEN RIBBON SCIENCE PANEL MEMBERS PROVIDED LEADERSHIP FOR THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES OF SCIENCES ALTERNATIVES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK. AND THEY'VE HELPED TO USE THAT THAT WORK TO INFORM OUR ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS GUIDANCE. THE CALIFORNIA ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS GUIDE IS A COMPREHENSIVE RESOURCE FOR THE REGULATED COMMUNITY AND ALTERNATIVES ARE NOT ANALYSIS PRACTITIONERS. LAST FALL WE HOSTED THE SECOND INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ALTERNATIVES ASSESSMENT. THE BAND THAT BROUGHT LEADERS LEADING RESEARCHERS AND PRACTITIONERS TO SACRAMENTO. IT'S CLEAR THAT THE TIME IS RIGHT FOR GREATER ADOPTION OF METHODS TO LOOK FOR SAFER ALSO AND ALTERNATIVE SAFER SUBSTITUTES WITHOUT INCURRING UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. PAGE FIVE OF YOUR HAND OUT HAS SOME INFORMATION ON CAL SAY FOR OUR INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. CAL SAFER PROVIDES ONE STOP SHOPPING FOR THE ENTIRE REGULATORY PROCESS. IT FACILITATES TRANSPARENCY AND INFORMATION SHARING BETWEEN US AND THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN OUR WORK. AND IT'S MADE US MORE EFFICIENT WE CAN COMPILE COMMENTS AND REVIEW THEM IN A MUCH MORE ORGANIZED FASHION. THESE ARE A FEW OF THE ACTIONS BE TAKEN IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS TO IMPLEMENT THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS REGULATIONS. IN ARE DECISIONS WE'VE EXERCISE THE CONSIDERABLE DISCRETION THAT THE REGULAR REGULATIONS AFFORD WE'VE MADE POLICY DECISIONS TO PROTECT WORKERS AND CHILDREN. IN OUR WORK PLAN EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING THE MOST VULNERABLE VULNERABLE. THIS HEARING WAS PROMPTED BY THE RELEASE OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE REPORT AND TAKING STOCK OF CALIFORNIA'S APPROACH TO GAME GREEN CHEMISTRY. GIVEN THE LACK OF ACTION AND LEADERSHIP AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IT'S IMPORTANT THAT CALIFORNIA CONTINUE TO BE OUT FRONT ON TOXICS. WE HAVE REVIEWED THE REPORT AND USED IT TO REFLECT ON OUR WORK. MANY OF THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE REPORT ARE SPOT ON WE AGREE THAT IT'S TIME TO REVISIT. THE OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE INITIATIVE. FOR INSTANCE WE'VE HIRED AS DR MOBILE HOME MENTIONED OUTSTANDING GRADUATES FROM UC BERKELEY'S GREENER KEPT GREENER SOLUTIONS PROGRAM. BUT WE NEED UNIVERSITIES TO EDUCATE MORE STUDENTS AND MORE DISCIPLINES IN THE CONCEPTS OF TRUE SUSTAINABILITY IN GREEN CHEMISTRY. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE TOXIC INFORMATION CLEARING HOUSE IS NOT SERVED ITS INTENDED PURPOSE. AND THAT THERE ARE BETTER MORE USEFUL TOOLS AVAILABLE TODAY. AND WE KNOW THE DTS HE'S POLLUTION PREVENTION PROGRAM OFFERS SOLUTIONS TO MANY. MANY INTRACTABLE ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS. RE COMMITTING TO THAT WORK WOULD BENEFIT THE STATE. ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. THE REPORTS DISCUSSION OF OUR DATA CHALLENGES ECHO THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATIVE REPORT OUTLINING A DATA GAP THE PREVENTS GOVERNMENT FROM ADEQUATELY PROTECTING PEOPLE FROM HARMFUL CHEMICALS. IT WOULD BE TREMENDOUSLY HELPFUL FOR US TO HAVE ACCESS. TO MANY TYPES OF DATA INGREDIENT DISCLOSURE AS THROUGH. MORE EXPOSURE STUDIES OR THROUGH STRENGTHENING OUR DATA CALL IN AUTHORITY. WE WILL BENEFIT FROM THE TRANSPARENCY INITIATIVES LIKE SB. TWO TO FIFTY EIGHT THE CLEANING PRODUCTS RIGHT TO KNOW ACT. WE BELIEVE THAT DATA FROM THE CALIFORNIA BY A MONITORING PROGRAM NOT ONLY CAN INFORM OUR PROVIDE OUR PRIORITIZATION WORK. BUT COULD POTENTIALLY PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE EFFICACY OF OUR ACTIONS. BIO MONITORING FUNDING HAS BEEN PRECARIOUS AND INADEQUATE. WE WILL FOLLOW THE REPORT'S RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE GREEN CHEMISTRY THE GREEN RIBBON SCIENCE PANEL DO A PRIORITIZATION LOOK BACK TO SEE IF THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE DEPARTMENT. TO STRENGTHEN OUR PRIORITIZATION APPROACH OR IMPROVE THE PRESS THE PACE OF THE PRIORITIZATION PROCESS. WE ARE ALREADY PREPARING MATERIALS ON THIS TOPIC AND IT WILL BE THE FOCUS OF OUR SECOND OUR OUR GREEN RIBBON SIGNS PANEL SECOND MEETING LATER THIS YEAR. SOME OF THE OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS NEED IN ME DEEPER ANALYSIS OR NEED MORE INFORMATION BEFORE PURSUING. FOR INSTANCE WE HAVEN'T YET RECEIVED HER FIRST ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS ANALYSES SO IT MAY BE PREMATURE TO TINKER WITH THAT PART OF THE FRAMEWORK. DTS SEE HAS ALREADY PROVIDED GUIDANCE SINCE AND WE STAND READY TO SUPPORT. TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO THE REGULATED COMMUNITY AS THEY GO THROUGH THE PROCESS AND WILL CONTINUE TO EXAMINE OTHER OPTIONS TO EXIT OUT EXPEDITE THE ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS PROCESS BY WORKING WITH COMPANIES. WHO ARE BEGINNING TO CONDUCT THE ALTERNATIVES ANALYSES? I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T ADDRESS THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE PACE OF OUR WORK. THERE ARE MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THAT AND SUMMER INHERENT TO THE FRAMEWORK WHICH ALTHOUGH PRECAUTIONARY IN NATURE'S STILL. CALLS FOR ROBUST SCIENCE. THERE ARE INHERENT TENSIONS BETWEEN SCIENCE BASED IN WELL SUPPORTED DECISIONS AND QUICK IDENTIFIES SHOULD IDENTIFICATION OF PRODUCTS. BETWEEN FAST ACTION TO LIMIT A CHEMICAL AND THOROUGH ANALYSES TO LIMIT REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTES. AND BETWEEN PROVIDING A FULL OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT. AND MOVING FAST WE'VE BEEN VERY COMMITTED TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS AND HAD ITERATIVE ENGAGEMENT FOR EVERY SIGNIFICANT DECISION THE PROGRAM HAS MADE. AND THIS LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT TAKES TIME. THE NEWNESS AND NOVELTY OF THE APPROACH IS ANOTHER REASON THAT THE RATE AT WHICH WE'VE IMPLEMENTED THE REGULATIONS HAS BEEN SLOWER. THAN MANY STAKEHOLDERS WOULD HAVE LIKED. AND FIRST IN SOME CASES THEN WE WOULD HAVE LIKED -- FOR THE FIRST SEVERAL YEARS OF THE EVERY SINGLE THING WE DID WAS BEING DONE FOR THE FIRST TIME. SOME MORE HIGHLY SKEPTICAL THAT WE COULD DO DO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE ASKED FOR SOME AND WHATEVER GREEN RIBBON SIGNS PANEL MEMBERS FOR INSTANCE SAID WE HE HONESTLY DIDN'T THINK WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DEVELOP ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS GUIDANCE. BUT HE'S SINCE BECOME THAT CONVINCED THAT NOT ONLY COULD WE DEVELOP THAT GARDENS. BUT WE DID IT WELL. WE STRUCTURE THE PROGRAM TO BE A LEARNING ORGANIZATION WE APPLY WHAT WE LEARNED FROM OUR SUCCESSES AND OUR MISSTEPS. TO BE MORE EFFICIENT I'M CONFIDENT THAT THIS WILL BE APPARENT IN THE PACE OF AND QUALITY OF THE WORK THIS YEAR AND FURTHER INTO THE FUTURE. BUT AS THE REPORT POINTS OUT ONE OF OUR BIGGEST CONSTRAINTS IS RESOURCES. ASI MENTIONED WE'VE HAD SEVERAL SUCCESSFUL BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS. AND THE PROGRAM HAS USED THE RESOURCES IT'S BEEN GIVEN THROW THOSE PROPOSALS AS EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE. MORE RESEARCH IS WOULD ALLOW THE PROGRAM TO DO EVEN MORE AS IT MOVES FOR WITH IMPLEMENTATION. UNFORTUNATELY THE CURRENT LEVEL OF RESOURCES WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENT FOR THE PROGRAM TO HAVE THE IMPACT IT COULD AND SHOULD ON PER TO FIND CONSUMER PROTECTION. OF COURSE WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT THE NEED FIRST SEP RESOURCES OUTSIDE OF A DISCUSSION OF THE LARGER PRESSURE ON DTS SEES BUDGET. DGSE NEED SUPPORT ACROSS THE BOARD TO ADDRESS ITS REVENUE SHORTFALLS. THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACCOUNT OR TOSCA THAT FUNDS. S. C. P. IS IN STRUCTURAL DEFICIT. IT'S BEEN TWENTY YEARS SINCE THE DEPARTMENTS FEES WERE RESET. BEYOND TOSCA THE LEGISLATURE COULD HELP EVALUATE POTENTIAL REVENUE STEAM STREAMS FOR SEP. A POLICY ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT. MODELS COULD BE INFORMATIVE. FOR INSTANCE FUNDING UNDER MASSACHUSETTS TALKS EXCUSE REDUCTION ACT. HAS ENABLED THE STATE THAT STATE TO FUND PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN UNIVERSITY RESEARCHERS AND MANUFACTURERS TO DEVELOP PAINT STRIPPERS SAFER PAINT STRIPPERS PERFORMANCE TEXTILES ADHESIVES AND NAIL PRODUCTS. CALIFORNIA PRIDES ITSELF ON ITS LEADERSHIP. IF WE WANT TO STAY IN THE LEAD WE MUST FULLY COMMIT TO THIS WORK. WE WELCOME THIS CHECK IN. AT TEN YEARS IT'S APPROPRIATE. SOMETIMES I DRAW A PARALLEL BETWEEN A GROWING CHILD AND THE GROWTH OF THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM. WE WERE A TODDLER IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WHEN WE NAMED WHEN WE PROPOSED OUR FIRST THREE PRIORITY PRODUCTS. AND QUITE FRANKLY WE FELL ON OUR BOMB A FEW TIMES. BUT WE GOT UP AND KEPT MOVING. AND NOW WE'RE LIKE A TEN YEAR OLD. WE HAVE SOME SPROUT A SURPRISING NUMBER OF SKILLS AND WE'RE LEARNING IN AN ASTONISHING PACE. MAYBE AS A TEENAGER WILL REALLY START TO CALL CAUSE SOME TROUBLE. WE'RE BEGINNING TO SEE THE IMPACT. THE VINYL FLOORING INDUSTRY REMOVED OR IF OF FALAISE FROM THEIR PRODUCTS IN RESPONSE TO OUR WORK PLAN. WE KNOW THAT MANUFACTURERS DIDN'T EVEN WAIT FOR US TO COMPLETE OUR REGULATIONS TO LIST SLEEP PRODUCTS CONTAINING SOME FLAME RETARDANTS AS A PRIORITY PRODUCT. BEFORE THEY STARTED REMOVING THE FLAME RETARDANTS THAT WE THAT WE NAMED. EVERYONE HERE WANTS THE SAME THING IT'S THE VISION THAT THE DOCTOR MOBILE HOME LAID OUT. GIVE YOUR KID A TOY DON'T THINK TWICE ABOUT IT HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT IT'S SAFE. SO WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE IN TERMS OF THAT GOAL AND WHERE WE'RE HEADED. AND IT TOOK A LOT OF US ALL OF US TO GET THIS FAR IN IS GOING TO TAKE US ALL OF US TO KEEP THINGS MOVING FORWARD. DURING THIS MORNING STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS GOVERNOR NEWS AND TALKED ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S CULTURE OF INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP. ON A COUPLE DIFFERENT OCCASIONS HE TALKED ABOUT THE STATE'S ABUNDANCE OF SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS. WHO SOLVE PROBLEMS AND DRIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH? I ONCE LOOKED AT THE CLEAN TECH PATENTS COMING OUT OF CALIFORNIA. AND WHILE THE NUMBERS WERE IMPRESSIVE NOT NEARLY ENOUGH OF THEM WERE GREEN CHEMISTRY PATENTS. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE A GREEN GREEN CHEMISTRY BECOME A STRONG STRONGER ECONOMIC SECTOR IN THE STATE. WITHOUT TO WRAP UP THANK YOU FOR GIVING ATTENTION TO GREEN CHEMISTRY AND FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT DTS HE'S WORK. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TOWARD THE GOALS WE WERE DISCUSSING TODAY. OF SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS A CLEANER ENVIRONMENT AND A GREEN CHEMISTRY INNOVATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR WILLIAMS FOR YOUR EXCELLENT TESTIMONY I WANT TO INTRODUCE SENATOR HENRY STERN MEMBER OF THE SENATE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEE. ARE DO YOU HAVE ANY -- INITIAL REMARKS. NOW ALL RIGHT SO THEN DO WE HAVE SOME QUESTIONS YES. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THAT WAS -- A VERY CLEAR AND VERY HELPFUL PRESENTATION. AND I CERTAINLY -- APPRECIATE YOUR G. AND THE PHILOSOPHY BEHIND -- THE WORK THAT YOU DO -- FIRST I WANT TO COMMENT ON SOMETHING THAT MY FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER DOLLY JUST A PICKY BACK ON HIS STATEMENT ABOUT. A SOMETIMES HAVING. TO MAKE DECISIONS WITHOUT YOU KNOW HAVING A HUGE CONSENSUS OR WITH THERE BEING DIFFERENT FACTS ON BOTH SIDES -- I LOOK AT IT A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY I LOOK AT WITH THE FACT THAT WHEN PEOPLE GO WHEN THEY PURCHASE PRODUCTS. THEY ASSUME THAT THOSE PRODUCTS ARE SAFE. THEY ASSUME THEY'RE SAFE BECAUSE WE ALLOW THEM TO BE SOLD. AND WHILE THERE ARE SOME CONSUMERS WHO HAVE THE WHERE WITH ALL AND THE ABILITY. AND A TIME TO DO SOME RESEARCH THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE DON'T -- IN FACT IF I WALK TO MY OWN HOME I COULDN'T TELL YOU WHAT PRODUCTS WERE RISKY AND WHAT WARRANT -- BUT WHEN I GO IN AND BUY SOMETHING YOU KNOW I HOPE IT SAFE I THINK I KNOW ENOUGH TO BE SKEPTICAL AND A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS BUT I I DON'T. I DON'T FEEL THE CONFIDENCE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO FEEL. AS A CITIZEN OF THIS SO I THINK WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT OUR CITIZENS AND OUR CONSUMERS ARE SAFE. AND THAT THAT IS THE PREDOMINANT RESPONSIBILITY WE HAVE ABOVE ALL ELSE. AND WHILE SOME DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TO FLORIDA A WATER HAS HAVE PUBLIC HEALTH -- BENEFITS AND RISKS ON BOTH SIDES THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE PRODUCTS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE NOT LIFE AND DEATH ARE PUBLIC -- A HEALTH -- NECESSITIES A LOT OF THEM ARE CONVENIENCES. AND SO THEY HAVE AN EXTRA RESPONSIBILITY I THINK -- TO BE SAFE. SO WITH THAT AS AS MY PHILOSOPHY I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU -- THOUGH AND ONE OTHER COMMENT IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF OUR MANUFACTURERS AND PRODUCERS WHO ARE VERY RESPONSIBLE AND WHO WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THINGS AND THEY ARE TRUSTED BRANDS I KNOW A LOT OF THEM ARE HERE. BUT THAT'S NOT THE FULL RANGE OF MANUFACTURERS AND WE CERTAINLY HAVE MANUFACTURERS THAT ARE NOT EVEN IN THE STATE OR IN THIS COUNTRY. WHO OPERATE UNDER VERY DIFFERENT -- REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT AND SO BUT THEY'RE ALSO ALLOWED TO BE SOLD HERE AND SO WE HAVE AN EXTRA RESPONSIBILITY WITH REGARD TO THAT AND PUBLIC HEALTH AS WELL -- WHEN I WANT -- TO ACKNOWLEDGE TO THAT I BELIEVE THAT YOUR DEPARTMENT YOUR OF DEPARTMENT OR AGENCY IS. UNDER FUNDED AND WE SHOULD CHANGE THAT AND GIVE YOU A LOT MORE RESOURCES BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS IMPERATIVE -- I NOTICE FROM MY FOR MY CONSTITUENTS I THINK IT IS FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE STATE IF THEY UNDERSTOOD -- WHAT WAS ACTUALLY IN THE PRODUCTS THAT THEY PURCHASE QUITE INNOCENTLY THINKING THAT IF THEY BUY WOULD TôI THAT IT'S JUST MATTER WHAT? AND THAT'S YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE BUT THEY DON'T. SO FIRST MY FIRST QUESTION IS DOES T. T. S. S.. S. C. HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO REGULATE THE CHEMICALS THAT ARE USED IN FOOD AND DRINK PACKAGING UNDER THE SAFE CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM AND IF SO ARE YOU CONSIDERING ANY OF THOSE RIGHT NOW AS PRIORITY -- PRODUCTS. SO WE DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO NAME -- FOOD PACKAGING AS A CONSUMER PRODUCT THE DEFINITION A CONSUMER PRODUCT IS QUITE BROAD TO BE REFERENCED OTHER DEFINITIONS IN CALIFORNIA STATUTE. IN OUR REGULATIONS. AND ON THAT. IT INCLUDES. PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING EXCEPT FOR MEDICAL DENTAL DEVICES AND A PESTICIDES REALLY THOSE OF THE THE MAJOR AREAS THAT ARE. THAT WE CAN'T ADDRESS THROUGH OUR REGULATIONS SO FOOD PACKAGING IS ON THE TABLE. AND WE HAVE A GROUP OF STAFF WHO ARE ACTIVELY RESEARCHING THEM THERE ARE QUITE A RANGE OF CHEMICALS THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE P. FAST CHEMICALS THAT ARE IN FOOD PACKAGING -- WE HA HAS LISTED AND CHEMICALS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THAT HAVE TURNED UP -- IN FOOD PACKAGING THERE WAS A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT BPA THERE'S SOME CONCERN AROUND AROUND STYRENE THAT SAID WE'RE VERY MUCH IN THE PROCESS OF EVALUATING THOSE THINGS AND WILL LIKELY HAVE IN A WORKSHOP. STE WHEN. LATER THIS YEAR JUST LIKE I KNOW TO PROPOSED TO EXPLORE THE TOPIC MORE FULLY AND RIGHT. AND YOU COULD CHILDREN'S HEALTH PRIORITY IN THIS PROCESS IN IN OUR WORK PLAN WE STATED SOME POLICY PRIORITIES AND CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND AND THAT INCLUDES NOT JUST CHILDREN BUT ALSO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE BECAUSE THAT CAN HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON CHILDREN'S HEALTH -- SO WE'VE WE PRIORITIZE THOSE SO SO INTENT IN A IF I AM INCORRECT IN THIS PLEASE CORRECT ME BUT MY UNDERSTANDING FROM LISTENING TO THAT IN TEN YEARS. DTS SEASON DOBBY REGULATIONS RELATING TO ONLY THREE CHEMICALS AS LISTED ANOTHER THREE IS PRIORITY PRODUCTS. BUT THE LIST OF YOUR CANDIDATE CHEMICALS IN THE LIST IS OVER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED FOR CONSIDERATION. LET ME CAN I FOR YOU IF I MAY I WILL RESTATE FAT AND ASSEMBLY DIFFERENT WAYS SO YES WE'VE WE RELEASED AN INFORMATIONAL CANDIDATE CHEMICALS LIST. AND ON THAT LIST I NO LONGER SAY HOW MANY CHEMICALS ARE ON THE LIST AND THE REASON I DON'T DO THAT IS BECAUSE ONE OF THE LISTS THAT WE REFERENCE IS THE CALIFORNIA BIOMONITORING PRIORITY CHEMICALS LIST. AND THAT LIST ALLOW THEIR USING A CLASS APPROACH TO CHEMICALS SO WHEN THEY SAID THE CLASS OF P. FAST WE ADOPTED THAT ENTIRE GROUP OF CHEMICALS. WHEN WE WHEN WE FIRST DID THAT WE THOUGHT THAT WAS ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND CHEMICALS AND NOW WE THINK IT'S ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND CHEMICALS SO? YOUR GUESS IS AS GOOD AS MINE AND SO IT IS IN THE THOUSANDS OF CHEMICALS BUT I CAN'T PUT A NUMBER ON IT. EASILY BUT IN TERMS OF THE REGULATIONS OF YOU'VE ADAPTED SO MANY THREE PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN ADOPTED OKAY IT SEEMS IT I MEAN IT SEEMS TO ME. UNLESS I ASSUME THAT THOSE FIVE THOUSAND ARE NOT GOING TO END UP BEING REGULATED WHICH YES AND OKAY SO YOU WOULD AGREE THAT THERE IS THIS TREMENDOUS BACKLOG YES AND AND MEANWHILE WE'RE ALLOWING ALL OF THOSE PRODUCTS TO BE SOLD. IN CALIFORNIA BEFORE WE REALLY DONE THE REVIEW TO KNOW IF THEY'RE SAFE. CORRECT OKAY -- SO WHAT DO YOU NEED TO ACCELERATE THAT PROCESS BECAUSE IF I WAS THOUGH IF I WAS IN CHARGE. OF ALL OF THIS I WOULD ALLOW ANYTHING TO BE SOLD UNTIL THEY WERE PROVEN SAFE BUT THAT'S JUST ME. SO -- SO WHAT DO YOU NEED. TO TO ACCELERATE THIS PROCESS AND GET THROUGH MORE OF THESE CHEMICALS MORE QUICKLY. SO. AGAIN YOUR QUESTION IS HAS MULTIPLE LAYERS TO IT -- IN TERMS OF THE TIME THAT IT TAKES TO DO THINGS WERE YOU KNOW. I WRENCH IN SOME OF THE TRADE OFFS BETWEEN FOR INSTANCE TRANSPARENCY AND PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AND MOVING QUICKLY -- AND I WOULDN'T WANT TO SACRIFICE THAT FOR INSTANCE -- WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE APA PROCESS TO GET A PRIORITY PRODUCT LISTED AND THAT MEANS RESPONDING TO ALL THE COMMENTS THAT CENTRIST SO THOSE ARE CONSTRAINTS UNLESS -- UNLESS WE CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE A FOR A PRIORITY PRODUCT LISTING THAT'S GONNA TAKE WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE -- I WOULD SAY THAT -- SOME OF THE RIVER THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE REPORT BETTER CALL IN INFORMATION. DID A CALL AND WE HAVE SPENT. SURPRISING AMOUNT OF TIME TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT CHEMICALS ARE AND WHAT PRODUCTS. IT'S HARD. IT IS REMARKABLY HARD THERE INDUSTRY HAS COMMITTED TO DOING SHARING MORE INFORMATION BUT OFTEN THAT'S BEHIND PAY WALLS THAT WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS. TO SO -- THAT'S THAT'S ONE BIG CHALLENGE AND IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE CONTROL OVER OR IS THERE SOME FEDERAL PREEMPTION. THAT WOULD PREVENT US FROM REQUIRING. THAT SHARING OF INFORMATION NOT NECESSARILY WITH THE PUBLIC BUT WITH YOU. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION -- I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANY PROHIBITION AGAINST IT -- I THINK THAT IF IF IT WERE CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION THAT HAD BEEN SHARED WITH USEPA UNDER TOSCA AND THERE MAY BE SOME RESTRICTIONS ABOUT HOW THEY WOULD YOU KNOW ABOUT SHARING INFORMATION THROUGH THAT CHANNEL BUT IN OTHER WAYS I I WOULD THINK THAT WE WOULD. HAVE SOME ABILITY TO TO TAP INTO THAT INFORMATION -- AGAIN THE RESOURCES -- HE BROUGHT A NUMBER OF NEW STAFF ON JUST JUST WITHIN THE LAST MONTH WE NINE WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE. EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT NEW STAFF MEMBERS ALL AT ONCE AND YOU CAN JUST ALREADY SEE HOW BIG A DIFFERENCE THAT MAKES. IN TERMS OF THEM COMING UP TO SPEED DEVELOPING REC PACKAGES MORE QUICKLY I GUESS MY QUESTION IS DO YOU HAVE A WISH LIST THAT WOULD HELP YOU GET THROUGH THESE A LOT MORE QUICKLY -- MORE STAFF IS IS PROBABLY MY NUMBER ONE WISH LIST -- AND THEN BETTER DATA CALLING AUTHORITY IS VERY HIGH ON MY WISH LIST AND THEN I WOULD SAY THAT -- WE THINK THAT THE TRAINS THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN. GAINING MOMENTUM ARE GOING TO BE VERY HELPFUL FOR US BUT I WOULD SAY ON THAT FRONT -- SME OF THOSE HAVE COME WITHOUT RESOURCES SO FOR INSTANCE THE CLEANING PRODUCT RIGHT TO KNOW IS HOMELESS IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF A STATUTE NOBODY REALLY OWNS THAT. AND SO YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S AN AREA WHERE WE CAN'T GET THE MAXIMUM VALUE OUT OF IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW NOBODY'S WE DON'T EVEN THERE'S NO THERE'S NO MECHANISM TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S ENFORCED AND IT'S IT'S KIND OF IN LIMBO BETWEEN MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS AND DO YOU HAVE DEDICATED. FUNDING SOURCE AND WHAT IS IT IT'S THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACCOUNT THAT IS IT IS IT A IS IT A SEE A STATIC AMOUNT. IT'S IT'S IT'S FUNDED BY ENVIRONMENTAL FEES IT HAS A LOT OF MY VARIATION FLUCTUATION AND IT'S USED BY MUCH BIGGER PARTS OF THE PROGRAM BY THAT OF THE DEPARTMENT. OKAY I JUST HAVE A FEW MORE -- SO THE LEGISLATURE'S PROPOSED BILLS OVER THE YEARS DEALING WITH ON INDIVIDUAL CHEMICALS THAT COME TO OUR ATTENTION AND A LOT OF TIMES WERE TOLD. NO NO. THAT'S NOT YOUR JOB WE HAVE THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF IT RIGHT. SO THAT CAN BE FRUSTRATING TO OUR COMMUNITY ESPECIALLY HEARING THAT YOU'VE GOT FIVE THOUSAND CHEMICALS AND YOU'VE YOU KNOW GOTTEN THROUGH A HANDFUL OF THEM. SO. DOES IT MAKE SENSE FOR US TO ACT ON SOME OF THE SUBSTANCES GIVEN HOW CHALLENGING IT'S BEEN FOR YOU TO REGULATE THEM. THERE ARE GOING TO BE CASES WHERE WOULD MAKE SENSE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ACT -- PART OF THAT DEPENDS ON FOR INSTANCE THE POTENTIAL FOR REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTES. IF IF YOU'RE ACTING ON A CHEMICAL WHERE THERE'S A HIGH POTENTIAL FOR REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTES I THINK IT'S RESPONSIBLE TO GO THROUGH THE ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS PROCESS -- IF IT'S SOMETHING WHERE EVERYBODY KNOWS THERE'S AN ALTERNATIVE OUT THERE AND MAKE A COUPLE MANUFACTURERS HAVE ALREADY ADOPTED A SAFER ALTERNATIVE. YOU GET TO THE POINT WHERE IT IS IT REALLY A IS THERE AN EXCUSE TO STILL HAVE THAT PRODUCT ON THE MARKET SO -- I THINK IT'S SITUATIONAL BUT I DO THINK THERE ARE CASES IN WHICH IT MAKES SENSE BUT SAYING THAT WE SHOULDN'T BAN. A DANGEROUS CHEMICAL BECAUSE THEY MIGHT YOU SOMETHING WE SHOULD KNOW THAT AND WE SHOULD PROBABLY BàN ALL THOSE CHEMICALS BUT I JUST I JUST HAVE A EASE TO ISSUE MORE IT'S REALLY YOU KNOW PESTICIDES ARE THE BEST EXAMPLE OF THAT. WHAT WE'VE DONE -- TO EVEN GETTING RID A LEADING GAS AND GETTING IN TV AND NOW WE HAVE GROUNDWATER COMMUNICATION -- CONTAMINATION ALL OVER THE STATE WE END UP WITH THE BPA TO BE PS TO WHATEVER. AND AND SO WHEN. YES THAT REALLY HAS TO INFORM THE DECISION. OKAY -- TWO MORE QUICK QUESTIONS THE FIRST IS -- DEREGULATION'S FRAMEWORK NOTES THAT THAT THE STAKEHOLDERS COMPETITION D. T. S. C. TO ADOPT A PARTY PS PRODUCT AND I'M WONDERING IF ANYONE HAS DONE THAT WE'VE HAD TO PETITIONS HAVE YOU ACCEPTED THEM A NO THE FIRST PETITION WAS DENIED THE THE PETITION PROCESS IS PRETTY. EXTENSIVE. AND REALLY WHAT THE PETITION PETITIONER'S RECORD TO DO IS DO THE SAME LEVEL OF DOCUMENTATION OF ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE CALLED OUT IN THE REGULATIONS THAT WE'RE REQUIRED TO CONSIDER. WHEN THEY SUBMIT THEIR PETITIONS SO IN THE -- FOR LININGS AND THE PETITIONER -- SUBMITTED A ON A FAIR AMOUNT OF INFORMATION WE WORK WITH THE PETITIONER TO STRENGTHEN THE PETITION IN THE END WE DENIED IT HOWEVER WE THOUGHT THERE WAS ENOUGH CONCERN RAISED IN THE PETITION THAT THAT WAS ONE OF THE PRIME MOTIVATORS FOR US PUTTING FOOD PACKAGING. INTO OUR WORK PLAN AND THE SUBSEQUENT WORK PLAN. THAT WAS THE FIRST ONE THE SECOND PETITION WE RECEIVED ACTUALLY CAME FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION ARE THE CALIFORNIA. STORM WATER QUALITY ASSOCIATION KASKA AND THAT WAS TO PETITION FOR ZINC IN TIRES -- THERE ARE WATER BODIES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE GOING TO BE IMPAIRED OR ARE ALREADY IMPAIRED FOR ZINC. AND TIRES ARE ONCE OF ONE SOURCE THAT -- IS POTENTIALLY RIGHT FOR INNOVATION AND SO WE'RE STILL WE'RE WORKING WITH THAT PETITIONER DAVE COMMITTED TO GIVING US ADDITIONAL INFORMATION LATER THIS SPRING. AND AFTER SHORTLY AFTER THAT I THINK WILL MAKE A DECISION ABOUT THAT PETITION ANOTHER USE THOSE TIRES TO MAKE ARTIFICIAL TURF THE PEOPLE PUT IN THEIR YARDS THEIR KIDS TO PLAN YEAH THAT'S A FROM. THE LASTLY DO YOU GIVE THOUGHT TO THE SAFETY OF PRODUCTS WHEN THEY'RE YOU WHEN THEY ARE. PUT INTO EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES SO I'M THINKING OF NUMBER ONE THE NUMBER OF PRODUCTS NOW THAT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN FOREST FIRES. SO HOMESTHAT HAD CHEMICALS THAT MAYBE NOBODY ANTICIPATED BEING INCINERATED BUT THE KNOWER AND SISTER INSERTED IN TURN INTO ACTION OR BREATHED. AND SEX OR PRODUCTS THAT END UP IN A OUR FLOOD PRONE AREAS IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU GIVE CONSIDERATION TO BECAUSE THOSE END UP -- YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY -- NOT THAT I'M COMMONLY I'M HAVING THOSE KINDS OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND YOU KNOW I WE'VE READ ABOUT YOU KNOW THE HURRICANES IN THE SOUTH AND THIS TOXIC BREW THAT YOU KNOW WILL BE MAKES THE ENTIRE STATE TOXIC. IS THIS SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE GIVING ANY THOUGHT. TO I WOULD SAY WE WE HAVEN'T SINGLE THAT OUT MADE OUT OF FOCUS OF OUR EFFORTS HOWEVER THERE ARE A COUPLE CASES WHERE THAT THAT KIND OF CONSIDERATION IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT WITH THE FLAME RETARDANTS. THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT FIREFIGHTERS ARE SUFFERING FROM. SOME OF THE THE REPERCUSSIONS FROM BEING EXPOSED TO THOSE FLAME RETARDANTS AND OTHER CHEMICALS ALSO IN AS THEY FIGHT FIRES -- AND SO THAT THAT GOES INTO THE CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN -- CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE BUT THAT HAS NOT BEEN A FOCUS BUT GIVEN THE FACT THAT DGSE IS THE FIRST DEPARTMENT THAT GOES IN TO ALL OF THE FROM WILDFIRES SITES. AND EXPECTS WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE HAZARDOUS WASTE ON THOSE SITES WE KNOW HOW MUCH HAZARDOUS WASTE ISN'T IN. ANY GIVEN HOUSEHOLD AND IT'S A TREMENDOUS FOR CHEMICALS. WOULD CERTAINLY BE IDEAL WELL I'LL JUST CONCLUDE BY SAYING I HOPE THAT WE CAN ACCELERATE YOUR WORK AND THAT WE CAN SEE A GREATER BODY OF WORK PRODUCT OUT OF IT -- I THINK THAT THE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. ASSUME THAT THIS IS ALREADY HAPPENING AND A LOT OF THEM WILL BE SURPRISED TO KNOW. HOW MANY INCREDIBLY HAZARDOUS MATERIALS THEY THEY AND THEIR CHILDREN INTERACT WITH ON A DAILY BASIS AND -- SO IF WE CAN BE AT ALL HELPFUL YOU KNOW I'D LOVE. TO TO BE PART OF OF CHANGING THAT EQUATION THANK YOU THANK. THANK YOU FOR YOUR VERY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS I THINK YOU'VE GOT A HEART HEART OF A LOT OF THE MATTERS THAT. ARE THE REASON WE'RE HOLDING THIS COMMITTEE TODAY AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR ANSWERS ARE SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO BOTH COMMITTEES FOR QUICKNESS TOGETHER AND FOR YOUR YOUR BIRTHDAY HERE -- ANNIVERSARY YEAR. WHATEVER WE CALL THIS -- DOCTOR WILLIAMS I WANTED TO JUST ASK YOU DRILL DOWN A LITTLE FURTHER ON TWO ITEMS THAT YOU MENTIONED THAT AND TREAT ME ONE IS THIS -- THIS APPARENT LACK OF AUTHORITY OR AMBIGUITY EVEN IF THEY'RE ALREADY ABOUT DISCLOSURE OF THE USE OF CHEMICALS IN CERTAIN PRODUCTS THAT WAS GOING BACK THROUGH THE ORIGINALLY BE EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE IN. I MEAN IT'S IT'S I WOULD THINK THE THE INTENT OF THE AUTHOR'S ORIGINALLY WOULD BE ABLE TO I MEAN EVEN IS HERE IT SAYS THAT. YOU CAN YOU KNOW COLLECT THE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO ADOPT THE REGULATIONS AND WHAT HAVE YOU JUST TELL US A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THAT STORY OF TRYING TO GET SOME OF THIS DATA FROM INDUSTRY AND BARRIERS YOU FACE IS THERE BEEN LITIGATION ON THIS ISSUE WE HAVEN'T HAD LITIGATION OKAY. BUT I'M GONNA LET -- MISTER PALMER STICK TO THAT. SURE I THINK -- YOU KNOW ARE STAFF WORK HARD TO GET INFORMATION FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF SOURCES YEAH YOU KNOW PUBLIC DATABASES ARE COLLEAGUES AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND THE INDUSTRY'S THEMSELVES THE MANUFACTURE AND OFTEN WE GET A LOT OF GOOD INFORMATION. BUT OFTEN. THEY'RE THE THERE'S AN UNWILLINGNESS TO GIVE US MULTIPLE SAID STEPHEN SOME OF THE MANUFACTURERS OF PRODUCTS. DON'T ENTIRELY KNOW ALL THE CHEMICALS IN THEIR PRODUCTS BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEX AND LONG SUPPLY CHAINS SO -- WE DON'T HAVE DIRECT AUTHORITY TO REQUEST. THAT INFORMATION AND HAVE THEM RESPOND TO US AND GIVE IT TO US AS A REQUIREMENT WE HAVE A FORTY REQUESTED. AND THEY CAN SAY THANK YOU BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA GIVE IT TO YOU OR WHAT HAPPENS THEN THAT YOU SAY. PLEASE THEY SAY NO THANK YOU THEN YOU SAY OKAY I MEAN IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE LEFT WITH IS THERE NO WAY TO COMPEL. WHAT DISCLOSURE WHAT WE CAN DO AT THAT POINT IS WE CAN SAY? WE CAN TELL THE PUBLIC THAT THIS COMPANY CHOSE NOT TO SHARE INFORMATION WITH US THAT'S WHAT WE CAN DO. AND IS THAT OCCURRED WE HAVE NOT DONE IT YET WE HAVE HAD OCCASIONS WHERE -- WE WERE ASSURED THAT INFORMATION WAS FORTHCOMING -- REPEATEDLY AND WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED SO SO HOW COMMON IS LIKE HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU THINK YOU'VE BEEN DENIED REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION [inaudible] SOME YEARS. I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW THE NUMBER OF TIMES WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN DENIED I THINK THAT THE THE BIGGER PROBLEM THIS IS FINDING -- AS SOMEONE WHO CAN TELL US WHAT THEY KNOW AND IS WILLING TO GIVE US THE INFORMATION SO -- ON ONE HAND WE DO HAVE THIS CALL AN AUTHORITY THAT WHERE WE CAN ASKING IF IT'S NOT CAN WE CAN KIND OF PUBLICLY SAY THAT WE WERE GIVEN IT BUT IT'S TYPICALLY MORE. OF A CHALLENGE OF GETTING THE INFORMATION FROM -- IN THIS ACCURATE AND DETAILED ENOUGH SO WE MIGHT GET GENERAL INFORMATION BUT WE DON'T HAVE FOR EXAMPLE ENOUGH INFORMATION. TO TO DO ALL OF OUR WORK WE MIGHT SAY THERE IS THIS CHEMICAL NEVER WE DON'T OF THE CONCENTRATION THAT CHEMICAL WAR WE MIGHT KNOW CLASS OF CHEMICALS OR IN THE CASE OF SAY FRAGRANCES -- THAT INFORMATION OFTEN THE MANUFACTURE DOESN'T KNOW BECAUSE THE FRAGRANCE HOUSES KEEP THAT INFORMATION VERY CLOSE -- REGARDED AND THE MANUFACTURE MAY NOT EVEN KNOW WHAT CHEMICALS ARE IN THAT FRAGMENTS THEMSELVES SO. THERE'S A LOT OF LAYERS AND NAME IT MEAN DO THEY CLAIM THEY'RE CONTRACTUALLY BOUND NOT TO EVEN KNOW THAT THEY LIKE THEIR THEIR AGREEMENT WITH SAY THE FRAGRANCE HOUSE WOULDN'T ALLOW THEM TO SEE THAT BECAUSE ITS PROPRIETARY AND THAT KIND ARGUMENT. YES BUT THERE I MEAN WE DO WITH CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION AND MANY OTHER CONTACTS AND GOVERNMENT RIGHT I MEAN WE'VE DEALT WITH THAT KIND OF DATA. IN ALL. OIL MARKETS IN YOU KNOW THE FRACKING INDUSTRY IN ALL KINDS OF SECTORS BUT SO WHY IS THIS DIFFERENT. WELL YOU'RE YOU'RE THE TO THE COMPANY LET ME JUST INTERRUPT. A DOCTOR SOLOMON WILL BE SPEAKING AND ONE OF THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS. ARE OF THE PANEL THAT LOOKED AT THIS IS THAT WE GIVE THE DEPARTMENT MORE AUTHORITY. BY -- THEY'RE BRINGING UP EVEN IF YOU GIVE THEM THAT ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY. THEY MAY BE ABLE TO FIND THE RIGHT PERSON TO TELL THEM BUT THAT IS ONE OF THE REFORMS TO WE'RE LOOKING AT WHICH OF COURSE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN BROUGHT UP AS WELL. AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE REALLY NEED TO WORK ON AND I'M PRETTY SURE WE WELL. I DON'T KNOW SOMEONE HAS A BILL TO THAT EFFECT YET. HI GENDER ALLEN HAS A BILL TO THAT EFFECT ALREADY. IS OUT I MIGHT GOOD ENDED THAT LINE OF QUESTIONING BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU GUYS ARE FOUR STEPS AHEAD OF ME THAT'S VERY GOOD NEWS -- THE I JUST WANTED BRIEFLY ASK ABOUT THAT -- THE THIS NOTION OF INNOVATION AND THE LACK OF NEW I. P. AND SORT OF VENTURE CAPITAL POURING INTO ALTERNATIVE CHEMICALS SAFER CHEMICALS -- I KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF OR ADVANCED ENERGY RESEARCH IN THIS STATE -- CERTAINLY EVEN FEDERALLY THERE'S DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY WE SPEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR -- YOU KNOW RP AND IS THERE ARE THERE ANY BEST PRACTICES OUT THERE FOR FOLKS WHO ARE DOING THE KINDS OF CHALLENGE GRANT STORER INNOVATION PRIZES THAT THAT WE COULD BE LOOKING TO MAYBE IT FOR PRESIDENT THERE IS IS. KIND OF UNCHARTED TERRITORY -- I I DO THINK DOCTOR MALL THE WHOLE PROBABLY KNOWS THAT LANDSCAPE A LITTLE BETTER THAN WE DO HOWEVER I WOULD SAY THAT USEPA. HAD A GREEN CHEMISTRY AWARDS PROGRAM WHICH I BELIEVE IS DISCONTINUED. THIS IS A DISCONTINUED DOES ANYBODY. YEAH IS THERE WAS NO MY MONEY ASSOCIATED WITH BUT UNDER THIS IMAGE IT'S ACTUALLY NOT GOING TO BE TOO EXCITED BUT IT REALLY WHAT DID A GREAT JOB OF HIGHLIGHTING AND SORRY AGAIN A NUMBER OF CALIFORNIA COMPANIES THAT HAD BEEN. INNOVATING AND MOVING AWAY FROM TOXIC CHEMICALS. GOT IT AND THAT SO THAT THAT WAS AN AYE USEPA. GRANT SURPRISE PROGRAM AS SOME SORT. AND IF YOU LOOKED AT ANY OTHER EXISTING INNOVATION FUNDING THAT MEAN LIKE I'M I'M THINKING IT'S HARD OF THE STEPS TO GREENHOUSE GAS NEXUS HERE BUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE. EVEN OPR IS DOING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT GRANTS -- JUST TRYING TO THINK THE SMOKE AND OF INNOVATION BUT IT'S AN A CYCLOTRON ROAD WHICH IS A PARTNERSHIP THAT ARE WITH RP THEIR THERE -- THEIR THEIR MAINLY FOCUS AND ENERGY BUT I KNOW THEY'RE DOING SOME MATERIAL SCIENCE AND CHEMISTRY. THERE AS WELL WITH THE NATIONAL LABS. ANYWHERE ELSE. TO ON YOUR MIND. WELL YOU KNOW. WE DON'T LOOK A LOT OF THAT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A RESOURCE -- TO GIVE PEOPLE OR YOU TO I WOULD POINT OUT THAT IN OUR REGULATIONS ONCE WE GO THROUGH THE PROCESS AFTER WE'VE REVIEWED ON ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS IF WE FEEL THAT -- THERE'S NO MOVEMENT TOWARDS A CITY -- FOR ALTERNATIVE AND THERE IS AN AREA OF RESEARCH NEEDED WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE A WE CALL REGULATORY RESPONSE WE WOULD. ASK. FOR THE MANY FACTORS TO FUND A CHALLENGE GRANT THAT WOULD HELP FILL SOME OF THIS DATA GAPS THAT COULD MOVE. THE GREEN CHEMISTRY SOLUTIONS AND INNOVATION FOR CHOOSE THE FASTER YOU HAVE ONLY AUTHORITY HAVE YET SO WE HAVE A GOVERNOR IN THE SENSE THAT IT'S GOT. OKAY A THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU SENATOR HE BREAK UPS THE EXCELLENT QUESTIONS AND WE WILL BE LOOKING AT THE BUDGET. LATER ON WILL BE LOOKING AT THAT TOGETHER -- SO -- DOCTOR WILLIAMS I HAVE A QUESTION MYSELF. MR SOMEONE ELSE HAS A QUESTION FIRST OKAY GO AHEAD. I ASSEMBLY MEMBER MARRIAGE EIICHI THANK YOU I TRY TO FOLLOW UP BUT A DOCTOR WILLIAMS ON YOUR RESPONSE. TO MISS FRIEDMAN'S QUESTION ABOUT. TO YOU KNOW HOW WE'RE OFTEN TOLD -- WITH WHAT YOU CHARACTERIZES THE THE WHACK A MOLE APPROACH -- THAT -- THAT THAT WE SHOULD DEFER TO THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROCESS AND YET THERE IS THIS TREMENDOUS BACKLOG -- AND IT AND I I I THINK BECAUSE I HEARD YOU SAY THAT. THEIR THEIR BRAIN MAY BE. SITUATIONS WHERE THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD PURSUE ALTERNATIVE ANALYSES AND I WASN'T SURE IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE LAWS OF NATURE. THERE ARE PROVISIONS IN A REGULATIONS SO THAT IF THE IF THE LEGISLATURE'S CONCERNED. ABOUT SOMETHING THEY CAN ASK US TO LOOK INTO WOULD RUN THROUGH OUR PROCESSES NORMAL. SO FOR INSTANCE WE WERE ASKED TO LOOK AT LEAD ACID BATTERIES AND WE'RE DOING AN EVALUATION OF LEAD ACID BATTERIES -- SO THAT'S ONE WAY TO FEED PRODUCTS INTO OUR WORK IF THE LEGISLATURE THINKS THAT ARE ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS WOULD BE BENEFICIAL AND AND SO ARE YOU ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT -- OF WHO WE WENT TO INDIVIDUAL LESS LETTER -- BE OF THE REQUESTEDALTERMAN ELSE'S ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW -- A BILL HAVING TO BE PASSED IN ORDER TO HAVE QUESTIONS WILL WANT WE PROVIDE IN A PETITION PROCESS -- BIAS IF AND IF WE ARE ASKED FOR ANOTHER STATE AGENCY OR THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR. TO LOOK AT A SPECIFIC PART PRODUCT OR YOU COULD. LEGISLATURE DID WITH LEAD ACID BATTERIES AND GOVERNOR BROWN'S -- DESIRES AS WELL CITY SO IF A INDIVIDUAL -- THE LEGISLATOR MADE TO REQUEST THE YOU WOULD EXPEDITE THE REQUEST AS AN ALTERNATE ANNOUNCES. WHAT WE'D BE DOING IS EXPEDITING THE DECISION ABOUT LISTING IT AS A PRIORITY PRODUCT WHICH THEN WOULD TRIGGER THE ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS? SO [inaudible] IT'S BUT I WOULD I WOULD POINT TO THE BILL THAT -- REMOVE THAT PROHIBITED CAN'T CLAIM RETARDANTS IN CHILDREN'S PRODUCTS LAST YEAR. THAT'S NOT IN ANYWAY CONTRADICTORY TO OUR REGULATIONS. YOU KNOW THAT'S IN SO MANY OF THOSE PRODUCTS THERE'S NO NEED THERE'S NO NECESSITY TO HAVE THOSE FLAME RETARDANTS SO IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO TAKE ACTION. TO BAN IT YEAH. OKAY. OKAY -- SO. YOU MENTIONED -- BY THE WAY AT SO YOU'VE ADDED EIGHT PEOPLE HOW MANY PEOPLE DID YOU HAVE PRIOR TO THAT THIRTY TO THIRTY TO SELL. THAT FORTY PEOPLE SO EIGHT IS NICE ADDITION BUT IT'S NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE. ARE ADDITIONAL TO WHAT YOU HAVE IT'S A 15% OR SELL -- DON'T EXCUSE ME -- GOING -- TO P. FAST MUCH AGREES THAT ONE HAS TO LOOK AT GROUPS OF CHEMICALS -- RATHER THAN TRYING AS YOU SAID -- PLAYING WHACK A MOLE WITH ONE AT A TIME. AS WE WERE LOOKING AT P. FAST LAST YEAR. THERE WAS A GREAT CONSENSUS THAT THE LONG CHAINS -- I THINK SIX CARBONS OR EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT CARBONS. AND MORE WERE DEFINITELY A CONCERN AND THEN THERE WAS A BIG DISPUTE ABOUT THE SHORTER CHAINS -- AND I IT SUGGESTED THAT WE SEND IT TO YOU AS A REQUEST TO GIVE THAT PRIORITY IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT IT. FOR WHATEVER REASON THEN THEY'LL STOPPED IN THE SENATE I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHY -- BUT IN THAT CASE CAN'T. AS YOU'RE LOOKING AT P. FAST NOW IN. CARPETS ARE YOU LOOKING AFTER SHORT CHAINS SEPARATE FROM THE LONG CHAINS KNOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE MISS ONE CLASS RIGHT AND THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT. WE HAVE A SHORTHAND EXPRESSION IT'S ALL ROADS LEAD TO PERFORM -- ALKYL ACIDS. THOSE AS THE PFA ETS AND THAT'S TO SAY THAT -- THAT'S THE THAT IS THE SUBSET OF THE P. FAST FAMILY THAT'S THE MOST WELL CHARACTERIZED AND MOST WELL UNDERSTOOD TO HAVE TOXIC. EFFECTS. AT THE SAME TIME IF YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER SUBCLASSES THEY EITHER DEGRADED TO P. FAA'S OR PFA ETS ARE USED TO MANUFACTURE THEM. OR YOU KNOW THERE ARE THESE INTERCONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE CHEMICALS IN THE CLASS AND SO THE THE THE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PFA ETS. WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE A SAY. WE'RE WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS AT THE AS A WHOLE CLASS. AND THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE LONG CHAINS AND THE SHORTER CHANGE IS IN SOME WAYS ARBITRARY YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S I THINK THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THE LONG CHAINS ARE WELL CHARACTERIZED. RIGHT AND THAT'S WHY PEOPLE KNOW. IT'S NOT THAT THE OTHERS ARE SAFER NECESSARILY I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE ANYBODY HAS CONCLUDED THAT IT'S JUST THAT THEY'RE NOT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN AS WIDELY CHARACTERIZED SO WE WANT TO PREVENT A CLAIM WAS THAT THEY DON'T ACCUMULATE AND PEOPLE. ARE AS THAT WAS THE CLIP THERE'D THAT IS A CLAIM BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE CONSTANT EXPOSURE BECAUSE THESE CHEMICALS STICK AROUND BECAUSE THEY'RE IN SO MANY PRODUCTS. IT. YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE GOING TO STAY BE AN PEOPLE SYSTEMS AT ANY GIVEN TIME. OKAY THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO DOCTOR SOLOMON [inaudible] SO. THERE WAS AT AN OUTSIDE REVIEW OF THE PROGRAM. WITH SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO ACCELERATE -- THE THE PROGRAM SO COULD LOOK AT MORE CHEMICALS MORE QUICKLY. SO THAT. THE PERSON WE'RE GONNA TALK TO IS THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR AT THE PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE DR GINA SOLOMON. TRIED A SUMMARY OF HER EVALUATION OF CALIFORNIA'S GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM -- DR SOLOMON'S A REPORT AND TESTIMONY IS ON THE WEBSITE AND IT'S CALLED CALIFORNIA'S GREEN CHEMISTRY INITIATIVE AT AGE. TEN BY THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE AND DOCTOR SOLOMON. ARE DOCTOR PEGGY RANNELLS AND DOCTOR. ON HONG OF THE UC SAN FRANCISCO -- ARE THE AUTHORS. SO PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND GOOD AFTERNOON -- DOCTOR QUIRK AND CHAIRMAN ALAN AND MEMBERS OF BOTH COMMITTEES THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING ME HERE I'M. HONORED TO TO BE ABLE TO PREVENT AT PRESENT TESTIMONY TODAY I AM THE PRINCIPAL AUTHOR OF THE STUDY -- OUT ON CALIFORNIA'S GREEN CHEMISTRY INITIATIVE AT AGE. TEN AND THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IS A RESEARCH COLLABORATION. TWO AND YOU SEE SAN FRANCISCO FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO AREN'T FAMILIAR WITH THAT PA TRY IT'S A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT PROMOTES HEALTH AND WELL BEING AND QUALITY. OF LIFE THROUGH RESEARCH POLICY CHANGE AND DIRECT SERVICE. THIS PROJECT WAS ALSO SUPPORTED BY A GRANT FROM THE CALIFORNIA BREAST CANCER RESEARCH PROGRAM. AT C. B. C. R. P. IS THE LARGEST STATE FUNDED BREAST CANCER RESEARCH EFFORT IN THE COUNTRY. AND THAT PROGRAM IS FUNDED THROUGH A PORTION OF THE TOBACCO TAX -- AND IS ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. IT FUNDS RESEARCH INTO THE CAUSES AND THE PREVENTION OF BREAST CANCER AND SO SOME OF THE PROJECT -- LOOK AT POLICIES THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE BREAST CANCER RISK -- AND SO THE NEXUS TO THIS PROJECT IS THAT HUNDREDS OF CHEMICALS HAVE BEEN LINKED TO BREAST CANCER EITHER DIRECTLY IN HUMANS OR ANIMALS WERE IN THROUGH INDIRECT EVIDENCE SUCH AS ESTROGENIC OF FACTS -- ESTROGENIC ACTIVITY -- AND MANY DOZENS OF THESE CHEMICALS ARE STILL IN WIDESPREAD USE IN CONSUMER PRODUCTS. IN FACT OF MY ANALYSIS FOUND A HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN OF BREAST CANCER RELEVANT CHEMICALS ARE ON THE DTS SEE CAN IT CHEMICALS LESS SAID THERE IS A FAIR AMOUNT OF OVERLAP THERE -- THE RESEARCH PROJECT HOWEVER DO THE LADY. AT TO UP WITH EITHER POLICY ENHANCEMENTS THAT COULD STRENGTHEN THE CALIFORNIA GREEN CHEMISTRY INITIATIVE FOCUSING ON THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM THAT YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT -- THAT WAS ESTABLISHED ENTRY BE -- EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE ALSO LOOKED AT THE TOXICS INFORMATION CLEARING HOUSE -- UNDER SB -- FIVE OH NINE SO BE TALKING ABOUT THE BOTH OF THOSE IN THE BROADER FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE REPORT IN THIS PRESENTATION I'M HAPPY TO TALK. IN MORE DETAIL ABOUT THE BREAST CANCER SPECIFIC FINDINGS IN RESPONSE TO ANY QUESTIONS -- AT THE END. OF AND JUST TO SUMMARIZE WE GET TO THE CHASE OF THE MAIN FINDING OF THE STUDY ARE THAT THE CALIFORNIA LAWS AND THE PROGRAM ARE EXTREMELY INNOVATIVE THEY HAVE A VERY BROAD. IMPACT THE GOES VERY FAR OF BECAUSE WORLDWIDE REALLY GOES FAR BEYOND CALIFORNIA. AND THE PROGRAM EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSES SOME OF THE KEY ELEMENTS OF A STRONG REGULATORY PROGRAM. I DID FIND THAT TWO OF THE GAPS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE ORIGINAL REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT ACTUALLY. SPURRED THE CREATION OF THESE OUT. OF THE PROGRAM THE DATA GAP AND THE TECHNOLOGY GAP. THIS TO THIS DAY THEY'VE BEEN LARGELY UNADDRESSED UNFORTUNATELY. IN ADDITION THE SLOW PACE OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM RELATIVE TO THE HUGE SCOPE OF THE TASK -- AS WAS JUST DISCUSS. IS. IT HAS REALLY -- IMPAIRED ITS EFFECTIVENESS IN ADDRESSING THE BIG BACKLOG OF CHEMICALS AND PRODUCTS THAT MIGHT REQUIRE EVALUATION -- SO JUST TO SUMMARIZE BRIEFLY THE METHODOLOGY OF THE PROJECT PROJECT IS A QUALITATIVE RESEARCH PROJECT INCLUDED SCOPING REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE TO LOOK AT BEST PRACTICES. IN CHEMICAL POLICY THAT HELPED SERIES OF INTERVIEW QUESTIONS THAN WE DID SEMI STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH EXPERTS IN GREEN CHEMISTRY IN THE SCIENCE AND THE POLICY ASPECTS OF GREEN CHEMISTRY. THOSE INTERVIEWS WERE TAPED PROFESSIONALLY TRANSCRIBED EVERY TRANSCRIPTION WAS CHECKED OUT BY ME. AND AND THEN THEY WERE COLLUDED TO EXTRACT THEMES THAT. EMERGED ACROSS THE DIFFERENT INTERVIEWS. SO -- I INTERVIEWED TWO DOZEN EXPERTS FROM GOVERNMENT ACADEMIA THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND THE NONPROFIT SECTOR -- THEY WERE SELECTED BASED ON BOTH THEIR EXPERTISE AND ALSO AT THE DIVERSITY OF OPINIONS THAT THEY HAVE. OTHER DIVERSITY OF VIEWPOINTS -- AND THAT WAS THE INITIAL ROUND OF INTERVIEWS MORE THAN HALF OF THOSE FOLKS WERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT I LOOKED AT PEOPLE FROM OTHER STATE INTERVIEWED PEOPLE FROM OTHER STATES NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY -- AND THE INTERVIEWS -- ULTIMATELY IDENTIFIED GENERATED ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED TEXT EXCERPTS FOR ANALYSIS. THEN THE PRELIMINARY FINDINGS FROM THAT FIRST ROUND WERE PRESENTED ONE ON ONE IN THE SECOND ROUND OF INTERVIEWS THAT WERE LESS STRUCTURED. WITH TEN ADDITIONAL EXPERTS FROM ALL DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES AND FINDINGS WERE FIND BASED ON THE FEEDBACK AND THE ENTIRE PROJECT WAS OVERSEEN BY AN EIGHT MEMBER SCIENCE POLICY ADVISORY GROUP. SO THE FINDINGS REALLY WERE THAT THE CALIFORNIA GREEN CHEMISTRY LAWS IN GENERAL -- AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE IS. AND THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM -- WERE CITED BY. THREE QUARTERS OF EXPERTS FROM ALL PERSPECTIVES AS UNIQUE INNOVATIVE. HAVING A VERY BROAD SCOPE AND AN INTERNATIONAL IMPACT SO I THINK WE CAN BE -- IMPRESSED AND PROUD OF THAT FINDING. ONE BUSINESS SCIENTISTS FROM OUTSIDE CALIFORNIA IS BEING A PUT IT WELL I THINK BY SAYING I THINK THE CALIFORNIA IS TRYING TO DO THINGS THAT NOBODY'S DONE BEFORE -- WHICH IS WHAT I THOUGHT WAS UP A PLUS IT'S CERTAINLY BY THE CONTEXT -- SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM WAS ALSO RECOGNIZED BY MOST EXPERTS AS HAVING FOUR MAIN OTHER STRENGTHS HEADS VERY BROAD SCOPE IN AUTHORITY ACROSS ENTIRE CLASSES OF CHEMICALS AS YOU'VE HEARD AND ACROSS. A HUGE SWATH OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS -- SECONDLY IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PROMOTE INNOVATION AND REDUCE THIS RISK OF REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTION THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT TODAY. THIRDLY AT THERE'S A FOCUS AT KAT COMMENDABLE FOCUS ON PROTECTING VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND SUB GROUPS SUCH AS CHILDREN. AND FINALLY -- THERE ARE MULTIPLE OPPORTUNITIES SAYS SO THOSE FOUR THINGS WERE ARE REALLY VERY -- CAME UP OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS VERY SOLID -- SO DOCTOR OVER HELL MENTIONED THE THREE GAPS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE ORIGINAL TWO THOUSAND SIX REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE UP FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BY A DOCTOR'S MIKE WILSON WHO I BELIEVE IS IN THE AUDIENCE HERE TODAY -- AND DOCTOR MAKE SCHWARTZMAN QUITE BELIEVE IS WATCHING THAT WEBCAST UP FROM UC BERKELEY -- AND OUR FINDINGS IN THIS PROJECT SUPPORTED THE ANALYSIS OF THESE THREE GAPS BUT ALSO IDENTIFIED THAT THERE SUB COMPONENTS OF EACH OF THESE THREE GAPS. AND SO I THINK IT TOO USEFUL FRAMING FOR SOME OF THE FINDINGS IN THE REPORT SO AS A REMINDER THE THREE GAPS ARE THE DATA GAP -- THAT SAFETY GAP AND THE TECHNOLOGY GAP. AND THE DATA GAP. COME TO GO BACK TO THAT -- WELL JUST TO SUMMARIZE THE MAIN WEAKNESSES IN THE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM OR THAT THE DATA GAP IN THE TECHNOLOGY GAP. ARE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS THEY STILL HAVE NOT REALLY BEEN ADDRESSED BY THE LEGISLATION THAT'S IN PLACE MISS SAFETY GAP IS PARTLY ADDRESSED -- SO LOOKING AT THE DATA GAP THERE ACTUALLY THREE COMPONENTS OF THE DATA GAP. ONE IS GAPS IN CHEMICAL TOXICITY DATA AND OTHER WORDS. IT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE P. FASTS CHEMICALS BEING WELL STUDIED SOME OF THEM NOT BEING WELL STUDIED THEIR DATA GAPS IN THE TOXICITY. THAT HIM TESTING THAT HAVE BEEN DONE -- THAT'S GONNA HAVE TWO PROBLEMS ONE IS IT CAN MAKE THE ALTERNATES ANALYSES A LOT HARDER TO DO BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO BE -- EXPECTING TURN ITS ANALYSES LOOKING AT DIFFERENT CHEMICALS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN FULLY TESTED OR SCREEN -- FOR DIFFERENT EFFECTS ON HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT -- THEN IN ADDITION IT COULD -- KEEP THE KENNETT CHEMICALS LIST FROM BEING AS FULLY UP TO DATE AS IT SHOULD BE. A LOT OF CHEMICALS ON THAT LIST BUT THEY'RE STILL NORMA'S NUMBER OUT THERE THAT REALLY HAVEN'T BEEN -- SCREENED AND WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY SHOULD BE ON THE LIST OR NOT SAID THAT IS -- UP PROBLEM. THIS GAP THOUGH COULD BE ADDRESSED BECAUSE THEY'RE NEW PREDICTIVE TOXICOLOGY METHODS THAT ARE. ACTUALLY DEVELOPING INCREDIBLY RAPIDLY THAT ALLOWS -- ALLOWS VERY I THINK AFFECTED PREDICTION OF TOXICITY OF CHEMICALS. AND A WE HA THE OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT IS DEVELOPING THE ABILITY TO TO USE THESE METHODS. AND COULD USE THEM TO ANTICIPATE THE HAZARDS OF EMERGING CHEMICALS SO THIS IS A A POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITY I THINK -- THEN THE SECOND DAY THE GAP IS THE GAP OF IT IN EXPOSURE DATA. ON IT TOO VERY HARD TO KNOW WHAT'S GETTING IN ENVIRONMENT FACT AGAIN TO USE THE P. FAST EXAMPLE THOSE CHEMICALS BECAME EXTREMELY WIDESPREAD IN WATER -- AND AND SOIL CONTAMINATION IN EVEN -- YOU KNOW THERE'S AIRBORNE THEIR P. FAST ETHER IS THERE'S AIRBORNE. HAZARDS AS WELL -- SO THE IDEA THAT THERE WASN'T A REAL THERE ISN'T A REALIZATION OFTEN THAT THESE CHEMICALS ARE GETTING OUT THERE INTO THE ENVIRONMENT AND TELL -- KIND OF LATE IN THE PROCESS. THAT COULD BE ADDRESSED BY EXPANDING THE BIO MONITORING CALIFORNIA PROGRAM TO BETTER. AT TRACK CHEMICALS IN PEOPLE. AND ALSO BY ENHANCING AND BETTER INTEGRATING ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING THAT'S GOING ON ON CHEMICALS IN THE AIR WATER FOOD AND PRODUCTS -- AND THEN FINALLY THERE'S THE GAPS THAT THE PART OF THE DATA GAP THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SO FAR TODAY WHICH IS THE GAP ON INGREDIENTS INFORMATION AND PRODUCTS. AND THAT IS JUST A THRESHOLD PROBLEM FOR DTS SEE. THAT WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO PRIORITIZE CHEMICALS AND PRODUCTS FOR REGULATION AND TO THE PROGRAM IT'S IT'S VERY HARD AND IT'S EM ONE OF THE QUOTES THAT GOT ACTION TING EXPEDITION. YOU CAN SPEND A LOT OF TIME AND MONEY LOOKING AT THINGS THAT AREN'T HIGH IMPACT. AND I THINK THAT IT'S REALLY UP THAT CAPTURES THE PROBLEM. AND AT ANOTHER SCIENTIST WHO I INTERVIEWED -- SAID THAT CHEMICAL USE INFORMATION IT'S REALLY SOMETHING THAT WE'RE SIMPLY GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE THE DEPARTMENT THE AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE. AND THAT THE THIRTY OUGHT TO BE AVAILABLE FOR PRODUCTS. OUT WHAT ARE THE INGREDIENTS IN THIS CUP FOR EXAMPLE. AND FOR CHEMICAL MANUFACTURERS IN OTHER WORDS WE'RE ARE YOU SELLING YOUR CHEMICAL LACKS. SO THAT THEY CAN COME OUT OF FROM BOTH PERSPECTIVES AND THEN THAT SPEAKS TO THIS ISSUE IN THE% BAY AREA -- IAN WE'RE WE'RE DETAILS HE SAID SOMETIMES THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO TO ASK -- AND IF THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT -- THE PEOPLE NOT EVEN KNOWING WHAT'S COMING THROUGH THEIR SUPPLY CHAINS -- SAID THEY DID A GAP THOUGH IT AIN'T IN INGREDIENTS INFORMATION RELATES DIRECTLY THE OTHER BIGGEST CHALLENGE OF THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM WHICH IS THE SLOW PACE OF THE PROGRAM. BECAUSE I THINK THAT -- THE DIFFICULTY [inaudible] FINDING INFORMATION HAS REALLY SLOW THE PROGRAM DOWN -- ALMOST EVERYONE WHO I INTERVIEWED. SAID THAT THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN VERY SLOW. AND SOME SOME SAID THAT'S TO BE EXPECTED -- GIVEN THAT IT'S BEEN GETTING UP AND RUNNING -- AND OTHERS SAID THAT IT'S UNACCEPTABLE OF SOME OF FROM AN NGO SAID IT'S MOVING AT A PACE THAT SINCE THE PROGRAM. AND AND I THINK THAT -- I'VE HEARD SOME OF THAT TODAY -- SOMEONE FROM FROM GOVERNMENT SAID THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM IS LIKE A MACHINE AND THEY BUILT THE MACHINE THAT TESTING THE MACHINE THE WIDGETS MACHINE. ALL OF THAT TAKES TIME. AND BEFORE YOU START ALTERING THE MACHINE YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE PIECES WORK. AND THEN YOU CAN GO BACK AND INCREASE THE SPEED. AND SO UP I THINK ONE OF THE FINDINGS OF THE REPORT IS AT THIS POINT THE MACHINE IS BUILT AND TESTED. SO NOW IT'S TIME TO GO BACK AND INCREASE THE SPEED. HOW DO WE DO THAT WE'LL? SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE AROUND THAT ONE KEY RECOMMENDATION OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE HEARD THIS IS TO INCREASE THE FUNDING AND THE STAFF. CURRENT PROGRAM IS SEVERELY UNDER RESOURCE DID DOESN'T HAVE ITS OWN DEDICATED FUNDING SOURCE -- STAFF IS TOO SMALL FOR THE MANDATE -- AND THE PROBLEMS DO YOU NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND IN FACT -- I FOUND THAT CAN NEEDS -- TO TO REALLY RECOGNIZE ITS STATE SCIENTISTS AND PAY THEM WHAT THEY'RE WORTH -- IT'S BEEN IT'S DIFFICULT -- IF BOND UNDER -- IN THE STATE. TO REALLY RECRUIT THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST SCIENTISTS. INTO THESE JOBS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE HAVING TO TAKE SUCH A MASSIVE SALARY CUT IN ORDER TO DO IT AND SO. THERE ARE A LOT OF COMMITTED PEOPLE WHO DO YOU DO THAT THAT NIGHT AND I COMMEND THEM -- IT'S IT'S GREAT THAT THEY DO -- BUT THERE IS ANOTHER WAY TO INCREASE SPEED AND THAT IS THAT. THERE IS REALLY ONLY ONE PATHWAY THROUGH THE PROCESS AT RIGHT NOW -- AT AND IT REQUIRES THIS YEAR REGULATION WHOLE REGULATORY PROCESS TO JUST IDENTIFY A PRODUCT CHEMICAL COMBINATION. THERE COULD BE OTHER FAST TRACKS THAT WOULD HELP MOVE CHEMICALS CHEMICAL PRODUCT COMBINATIONS TO ROOM MORE QUICKLY IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES -- SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW IF THE PATH FORWARD IS REALLY OBVIOUS OR IF THE CHEMICAL IS NOT NECESSARY FOR THE FUNCTION OF THE PRODUCT. THEN YOU'D IS THERE REALLY A NEED FOR A FULL. PROCESS LEADING INTO A FULL ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS THAT THEN GOES ON TO TO AT A AT A REGULATORY DECISION SOMEONE FROM THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY SUGGESTED SOMETHING JUST LIKE THAT AB THAT SAID. IF YOU CAN FIND INGREDIENTS THE DON'T CONTRIBUTE TO THE FUNCTION OF THE PRODUCT. AND THEY'RE CAUSING AT LEAST A PERCEIVED PROBLEM OR AN ESTABLISHED PROBLEM. IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT THOSE PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE IN THERE. SORT OF A COMMON SENSE APPROACH -- THIS AT THE FLAME RETURN TO NAP MATS CAME UP -- JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO THAT'S A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING WHERE IT DIDN'T NEED TO BE IN THE PRODUCT FOR THE FUNCTION OF THE PRODUCT TO IN FACT WHEN. THE DEPARTMENT STARTED THE REGULATORY PROCESS MANUFACTURES VOLUNTARILY WENT AHEAD AND REMOVE THE FLAME RETARDANTS FROM THEM NOT MATCH THAT'S GREAT HOWEVER. THAT MEANT THAT IF THE LEGISLATURE HAD NOT VAN ACTED TO BAN FLAME RETARDANTS FROM NAP MATS. THE DEPARTMENT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BAN THEM EITHER. BECAUSE BY THE TIME THEY WERE DEAD DTS SEE WAS READY. TO RECEIVE ALTERNATES ANALYSES. THERE WEREN'T ANY TO RECEIVE. AND SO THE PROCESS AND IT -- DETAILS HE WENT OUT VERIFIED THAT THERE AREN'T FLAME RETARDANTS IN THAT MATCH AT THIS POINT IN TIME THAT'S GREAT. IF. COUPLE YEARS FROM NOW. IF THERE HADN'T BEEN LEGISLATION COUPLE YEARS FROM NOW SEVERAL COMPANIES COULD HAVE STARTED PUT FLAME RETURNS BACK IN THAT MATT'S -- BECAUSE DTS HE'S UNABLE TO ACTUALLY FINISH THE PROCESS AND BàN. A FLAME RETARDANT IN AND NOT MATT IF THEY DON'T GET -- A PROBLEM AS WELL THAT AN WHERE THEY COULD SORT OF CUT TO THE CHASE AND JUST TAKE A REGULATORY ACTION -- SO THOSE ARE A COUPLE OF SUGGESTIONS -- AND AND THEN THE OTHER ISSUES THAT CAME UP THAT I THINK -- YEAH I FOUNDER MORE CONTROVERSIAL AMONG -- MEMBERS OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY BUT RELATE TO SOME OF THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE -- SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT BE ACTING ON PRODUCTS IS THAT -- LEGISLATURE COULD -- IF THEY WANTED IF YOU KNOW LEGISLATURE ONE TO TAKE ACTION ON A CHEMICAL IN PRODUCT. BUT WAS WORRIED ABOUT THIS ISSUE REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTION SAID WANTED SOME SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS. COULD. SKIP THE INITIAL -- ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT PROCESS FOR THAT PRODUCT IDENTIFICATION. AND JUST PUT THE PRODUCT DIRECTLY INTO THE ALTERNATES ANALYSIS -- AND THEN IN A MAKE IT WITH A DECISION PENDING THE RESULTS CSUS -- SO THAT'S ONE ONE OP OPTION THAT COULD OCCUR -- SO THE JUST FOR QUICK MENTION RIGHT THE END ABOUT SB FIVE OH NINE THE OTHER STATUTE THAT WAS -- PASSED AS PART OF THE GREEN CHEMISTRY INITIATIVE PACKAGE. THE TOXICS INFORMATION CLEARING HOUSE THAT WAS CREATED UNDER THAT LAW UNIVERSALLY SEEN OUT BY THE EXPERTS AS NOT AT ALL USEFUL -- AND MANY EXPERTS SAID THAT THE ORIGINAL VISION FOR THAT CLEARING HOUSE REALLY HAS BEEN. FULLY SUPERSEDED BY OTHER TOOLS THAT ARE NOW OUT THERE -- SO SOME PEOPLE ON THE BASIS OF THAT RECOMMENDED JUST GETTING RID OF THE TAX INFORMATION CLEARINGHOUSE ABOLISHING IT ALL TOGETHER -- OTHERS SUGGESTED KEEPING IT BUT RESHAPING ARE SHIFTING THE MANDATE AND THE PURPOSE -- AND SPECIFICALLY AN IDEA THAT CAME UP. I THOUGHT WAS VERY INTERESTING. OF RELATED TO THE HAZARD TRAITS ALSO MANDATED UNDER SB FIVE OH NINE THE HAZARD TRAITS WERE IDENTIFIED BY A WE HA. UP BACK IN. TWENTY THIRTEEN AND WERE PRAISED BY OUT MANY OF THE EXPERTS THAT I INTERVIEWED AS BEING VISIONARY AND VERY USEFUL AND FOUNDATIONAL. FOR FIRST SURVEY CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK ALL HAZARDS -- AND TO SOME EXPERTS SUGGESTED TRANSFERRING THE TACTICS INFORMATION CLEARING HOUSE TO A WE HAVE. AND USING THE CLEARING HOUSE TO HOUSE INFORMATION ON CHEMICALS THAT ARE SCREENED USING NEW PREDICTIVE TOXICOLOGY METHODS. AND THIS HAS SOME BENEFITS WOULD ACTUALLY DRESS THREE PROBLEMS AT ONCE IT WOULD ADDRESS THE TOXICOLOGY DEEDED CAP THAT I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY. IT WOULD REPURPOSE THE TOXICS INFORMATION CLEARING HOUSE AND GIVE IT A NEW LIFE. AND THIRDLY IT WOULD. ALLOW -- SORT OF THE POTENTIAL TO UPDATE THE CANDIDATE CHEMICALS LIST OVER TIME. WITH NEW SCIENCE AS IT EMERGES SO FOR EXAMPLE -- AT AND BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE -- EXPERT SCIENTIST WHO I INTERVIEWED FROM OUT OF STATE SAID. SAID WE COULD BE DOING MORE WITH THE KENNEDY CHEMICAL CELESTE. EN ADDING AND THEY COULD BE ADDING CHEMICALS HAS THEY ASSESS THE HAZARD USING NOT JUST TRADITIONAL STUFF. THE PERSON MEANT TOXICOLOGY DATA BUT THE NEWER METHODS. SO THAT -- THAT IDEA I THOUGHT WAS -- INTERESTED A AN INTERESTING WAY TO MOVE THE SCIENCE FORWARD -- AND THEN I MENTION THE TECHNOLOGY GAP A COUPLE TIMES -- AND THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT -- DOCTOR MULVIHILL TALKED ABOUT QUITE A BIT. AND UNFORTUNATELY IT IT WAS NEVER REALLY ADDRESSED -- IN THE OR FROM THE ORIGINAL GREEN CHEMISTRY INITIATIVE VISION. AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S THE CARAT TO THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM STICK -- AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA LEADERSHIP. IT'S ALSO AN ISSUE THE GENERATED ACROSS THE BOARD IN THE Z. AS IN FOR EVERY STAKEHOLDER THAT I SPOKE WITH -- SAID THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT REALLY WAS. IN A VERY. VERY RECEIVE VERY WIDESPREAD ENTHUSIASTIC -- ENDORSEMENT -- SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT I THOUGHT WERE INTERESTING. OF ONE PERSON FROM AN NGO PERSPECTIVE SAID IT'S A LOT EASIER TO PUT PRESSURE ON SOMEBODY TO TAKE SOMETHING BAD OUT IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO TURN -- TO AND ANOTHER ANOTHER COMMENT FROM ANOTHER NGO A PERSPECTIVE IT SAID WE NEED CAP WE NEED TO ASSIST CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES TO LEAD THE WORLD IN GREEN -- DESIGN AND PRODUCTION. AND THEN IF THE PROGRAM ACTUALLY PRIORITIZE HAVE A SAFER SUBSTITUTE CAN INCENTIVIZE THE INDUSTRY TO COME UP WITH THAT. IF YOU FINISH IN THE NEXT MAN YEAH APPS ALMOST DONE OKAY -- SO AND I AND SO BE OF PEOPLE ALSO POINTED TO THE BERKELEY CENTER FOR GREEN CHEMISTRY IS A MODEL THAT COULD BE EXPANDED COULD BE REPLICATED AT OTHER. CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES AND ALSO PEOPLE POINTED TO ONE CALIFORNIA LEADERSHIP AND CLEAN ENERGY AND THE BENEFITS THAT THAT'S BROUGHT TO OUR STATE WHICH IS A COMPARABLE OPPORTUNITY. SAID THOSE I THINK ARE THE OVERALL RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE REPORT AND TâM. AND I THINK THAT -- OVERALL THE THE MESSAGE -- AND FINDINGS OF THE REPORT ARE THAT THIS IS EXTREMELY STRONG. PROGRAM THAT WE ARE LUCKY TO HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT THAT THERE IT'S IT'S NOT QUITE ALL THE WAY THERE AND THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT COULD BE DONE. TO REALLY -- RING THAT VISION FULLY TO FRUITION THAT WOULD -- BILL THAT A STRONGER SAFER STE CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM A MORE RELEVANT CLEARING HOUSE IF CHEMICAL HAZARD TRAITS. AND A VIBRANT GREEN CHEMISTRY INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU DOCTOR SOLOMON FOR WORKING ON THIS PROJECT AND FOR THE OTHER ALL CO AUTHORS AS WELL. OF THIS IS SAM. MACHINE WASTE WHICH WE CAN HELP MAKE THE PROGRAM BETTER THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO US. I WANTED TO PARTICULARLY ASKING FOR A LITTLE MORE DETAIL ON THE IDEA SO WE HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE TO GET RID OF THE TOXIC LAST. FORTY CHANGE BRING IT TO ANOTHER DEPARTMENT AND USE PREDICTIVE OUR CHEMISTRY AGAIN. REVOLUTION WE HAVE WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WITH. A GREAT AMOUNT OF COMPUTER POWER HAVE GREAT BELIEF IN THAT SYSTEM. COULD YOU -- MAYBE CONTRAST THOSE TWO ALTERNATIVES AND WHAT YOU SEE IS THE ADVANTAGE DO YOU SEE A A REAL ADVANTAGE IN. HAVING THIS LIST AND THEN OF CHEMISTRY. I THINK THE REAL ISSUE IS THAT -- THE PREDICTIVE CHEMISTRY THE PREDICTIVE TOXICOLOGY. IS IS MOVING FAST AND THERE IS A GLOBAL VISION OF HOW TO MOVE THAT FORWARD SOME OF ITS DRIVEN BY -- INTO IT A RELUCTANCE TO TO DO AS MUCH ANIMAL TESTING HAS BEEN DONE THE AND AND THAT AND ALSO RECOGNIZING THE ENORMOUS. DELAYS AND BACKLOGS IF OF CHEMICAL TESTING -- AND AND ALSO RECOGNIZING THAT THE ADVANTAGES OF SOME OF THE NEW MODELS -- AND SO AS A STATE WE SHOULD BE ON THAT TRAIN. AND WE SHOULD BE ACTUALLY NO. BUILDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE WITH THE IN CALLEY PA. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SIN OF THIS NEW FIREHOSE OF DATA THAT'S COMING OUT. IN USING IT FOR GOOD TO HEAR AT THIS IS A BASIS FOR GOOD DECISIONS. AND IT'S GREAT BECAUSE WE CAN ACTUALLY COVER. LITERALLY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CHEMICALS WE WERE AS WERE TALKING ABOUT MANY FEWER WITH STANDARD TOXICOLOGY TESTING SO WITH THEIR SO I THINK THE ISSUE IS. IF WE WANT TO DO THAT. ONE WAY TO DO IT WOULD BE TO USE THIS TOXICS INFORMATION CLEARING HOUSE COMBINED WITH THE HAZARD TRAITS TO HELP SORT OF GIVE THAT A LITTLE. SEND OFF A LITTLE NUDGE TO HELP -- MAKE IT HAPPEN THERE WOULD BE OTHER WAYS TO DO IT SO I DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS THE ONLY ONE WAY TO THINK ONLY WHERE OUR POLITICIANS WERE GONNA DEPEND UPON -- YOU AND OTHERS TO DO. SO. CENTER ALLEN IS LOOKING AT THIS IN HIS BILL AND I WOULD JUST SAY -- PLEASE HELP US -- MAKE SOME GOOD DECISIONS IN THIS AREA AND I KNOW AS A SCIENTIST WE ALWAYS SAY ON THE ONE HAND ON THE OTHER HAND BECAUSE THE OTHER SCIENTISTS ARE GOING TO GET AFTER REST. IF WE SAY THERE'S CERTAINTY -- BUT I REALLY THINK WE NEED YOUR BEST JUDGMENT AND WE CAN -- GO THROUGH THAT AT ANOTHER TIME BUT IF YOU COULD HELP US -- CONSIDER THAT I I I AM A GREAT BELIEVER. THAT WE WILL NEVER HAVE ENOUGH MONEY AND TIME TO DO ALL OF THE EXPERIMENTS WE NEED TO DO PLUS WE HAVE. CONCERNS ABOUT THE LAB ANIMALS IT CETERA AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO ENCOURAGE THIS APPROACH AND I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO SEE IT -- TELL THANK YOU AND I THINK ONE PROBLEM WITH THAT THAT OF COURSE IS THE CLEARING HOUSE IS UNDER RESOURCES -- TO OR REALLY NOT. WE UNDER RESEARCH EVERYTHING JUST SO YOU'RE NOW -- BUT YOU KNOW SO IS SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING TO WAY THAT IF IT YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE FOR WERE ICY -- IF A WERE MOVED TO A WE HAD THAN THAT THERE WOULD STILL BE A NEED FOR THAT FOR RESOURCES -- TO TO TO TURN IT INTO SOMETHING THAT WOULD -- THE THE YOU KNOW THANK SO -- WE DEFINITELY GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THAT THE BUDGET AS WELL ARTS CENTER ALLEN DID YOU HAVE A COMMENT YEAH WELL I I JUST WANNA ASK YOU MEAN A PIGGY BACKING ON THE QUESTIONS OF THE CHAIR -- YOU HAVE SOME FOLKS CALLING FOR THE ALL THE ALL. ALL THE ELIMINATION THE TCL TOGETHER. OUT WHAT WHAT DO YOU SEE AS DID YOU SEE ANY VALUE IN THE CLEARING HOUSE AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW AND AND IF IT WERE TO BE ELIMINATED. I IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WE WOULD NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WOULD REPLICATE ELSEWHERE WERE FOUR HOUSE ELSE WHERE. ARE YOU KNOW. BECAUSE GETTING RID OF AN ENTIRE. ENTITY WITHIN THIS INFRASTRUCTURE MAY HAVE CAUSE UNFORESEEN. CONSEQUENCES. OR OR MAYBE NOT -- YOU'VE LOOKED INTO A VERY INTENTLY YEAH I MEAN THE CLEARING HOUSE ITSELF AS IT EXISTS NOW -- COULD BE ELIMINATED WITH REALLY MEAN. TO BE HONEST NO ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT -- PROVIDING ADDED BENEFIT IN ITS CURRENT FORM AND SO WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING. THAT'S NOT PROVIDING ADEQUATE BEYOND ANY BENEFIT YOU CAN ELIMINATE IT FOR YOU CAN SORT OF TAKE IT AND THINK WELL WHAT DO YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT COULD THIS BE. THAT IS NEEDED AND THEN TRANSFORM IT AND I THINK BOTH ARE REASONABLE -- PERSPECTIVES AND I CERTAINLY FROM THE EXPERTS THAT I INTERVIEWED THERE WAS NOT A CONSENSUS ON THIS ISSUE. MY MY FEELING -- AND THIS IS JUST ME I'M MUCH MORE MY BIAS -- SCIENTIFICALLY IS THAT I FEEL THAT THERE. THE THAT THE SB -- FIVE OH NINE MANDATED THAT A WEEK HA. ARTICULATE HAZARD TRAITS OF CHEMICALS AND WE HAD DID IT IN A WAY THAT RECOGNIZED WHERE'S THE SCIENCE WAS GOING. AND INCORPORATES THESE THROUGH PREDICTIVE METHODS -- AND IT -- IT WOULD BE A NICE FIT. TO USED. TO REPURPOSE THE CLEARING HOUSE TO HOUSE INFORMATION ON CHEMICALS THEY'RE NOT. ON THE KENNEDY CHEMICALS LIST -- BECAUSE THEY DON'T RISE TO THAT LEVEL BUT WHERE THERE'S INFORMATION FROM PREDICTIVE TOXICOLOGY THAT MIGHT RAISE FLAGS AND THEN THAT WOULD BE A RESOURCE FOR EXAMPLE FOR COMPANIES. THEY'RE DOING ALTERNATES ANALYSES AND THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A CALF GOT THESE SEVEN CHEMICALS THAT I'M CONSIDERING AS SUBSTITUTES. LET'S SEE IF ANY OF THEM XIN CLEARING HOUSE AS FLAG WITH HAZARD TRAITS BECAUSE THEN THAT THAT TO CONSIDERATION SO IT'S UNFOLDS IN AND AND BOOSTS. MAKES THE ACT ALTERNATES ANNOUNCES A LITTLE EASIER. ON CRIME. RIGHT WILL WHAT I THINK WILL BE WILL WANT TO CONNECT WITH THE UNSERVED TALK MORE ABOUT THE SPECIFICS BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOUR RENT CHAIRS RIGHT YOU'VE YOU'VE. FIVE ACTIVELY PRESENT ALWAYS OF A PERSPECTIVES THAT ARE OUT THERE BUT BUT HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO MOVE AHEAD WITH THE WOMEN IN THE CLEARING HOUSE WE THAT WE AND I'LL. BE. TRANSFER MAYBE THE HAZARD TRAITS MAYBE THAT'S THE KIND OF THE BETSY THAT IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT YEAH OKAY. THAT'S THAT'S ON THE THE OTHER THING I WAS ASKED I WAS THINKING ABOUT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE DATA GAP AND YOU KNOW -- PUTTING A LITTLE MORE TEETH INTO THE THE IN A THE THE THE THE ABILITY OF THE REGULATORS TO GET THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED. TO MAKE THEIR FINDINGS AND DETERMINATIONS. HAVE YOU SEEN OUT THERE KIND OF A BEST PRACTICES WITH AGGRESSIVE ENFORCEMENT OUT MAYBE ELSEWHERE IN MAYBE IN EUROPE OR OR ELSEWHERE -- THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION I I DIDN'T LOOK A LOT AT THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS -- A IN OKAY SOUNDS LIKE. HE CAN ASK BUT THEY'RE OUT THERE YOU KNOW. THE PEOPLE THE STONE WALL OF ALL TIME IN -- THE EUROPE BUT I THINK IT DOES HAVE PRETTY STRONG -- ENFORCEMENT ABILITIES CENTER REACH AND THEY HAVE BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE FAT. CALLING IN DATA -- MASTER AND SO I ANSWER BLUR SUBPOENA POWER CRIMINAL PENALTIES OR WHAT. WHAT'S IT'S RIGHT NOW BUT THAT SOMETHING COULD EASILY FIND OUT GET BACK TO YOU ON OKAY. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT -- LESS THEIR ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS WE SHOULD GET ON TO THE NEXT. PANEL WHICH A CENTER ALLEN WILL INTRODUCE [inaudible] SERVICE NEXT. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU DOCTOR SOLOMON WE REALLY APPRECIATE REPORT A GREAT DEAL. AND IT WILL BE THE BASIS OF SOME FUTURE WORK. ASSN NOW THIS NEXT FINAL PANEL LOOKS AT WHERE WE GO FROM HERE. AND WE HAVE -- FIVE FANTASTIC PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING UP TO THE TO THE TO THE DESK FIRST RYAN WILLIAMS WHO'S A HAD A PHD AND HE'S FROM GLOBAL GREENS KEEPER OF PRODUCT EXPERIENCE WEST OF THAT'S A WONDERFUL JOB TITLE -- WE ALSO HAVE NANCY BOY A BOY -- MEYER WHO IS SENIOR POLICY STRIDES WITH BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS TIME JACOB EXECUTOR AFTER THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA. HELEN HOLDER THE DISTINGUISHED TECHNOLOGIST WITH H. P. AND ALSO A MEMBER OF THE GREEN RIVER IN SCIENCE PANEL THAT. WAS MENTIONED AND I MEAN A CAR SENIOR ATTORNEY IN DIRECTORS. FOR STATE HEALTH POLICY FROM NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL SAYS YOU CAN SEE WE GOT SOME PRIVATE SECTOR VOICES WE'VE GOT SOME ENVIRONMENTAL VOICES. AWESOME PUBLIC HEALTH VOICES AND IT'S A GOOD MIX OF PERSPECTIVE SO WE'LL START WITH YOU DOCTOR WILLIAMS. THANKS VERY MUCH. BUT IT'D BE HEARING PRESENT TO THE TO THE COMMITTEE TODAY AND SIR. AND I GOT A LOT TO GET THROUGH SOME VERY PERSPECTIVES AND PRIDE MUST VALUE COMES FROM THE QUESTION SO. I'M REAL BACKGROUND ON METHOD WERE UP TO WEAR MAKE UP HOUSEHOLD CLEANING LAUNDRY PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS. NUMBER FOUND IN SAN FRANCISCO IN TWO THOUSAND ONE OF THE PROMISE THAT'S POSSIBLE TO MAKE PRODUCTS. THAT ARE BETTER FOR HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT -- SCIENCE TRANSPARENCY WE CONDUCT HUMAN HEALTH ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS INCLUDING ALTERNATE ASSESSMENTS ON EVER IN GREETING WE USE. AND WE KNOW THAT CONSUMERS EXPECT THE PROXY USE IN AND AROUND THEIR HOMES ARE SAFE -- AND EXPECTATIONS SAFE INGREDIENTS IS EVEN HIGHER FOR THE PRODUCTS THEY USE ON THEMSELVES -- OVER THE PAST EIGHTEEN YEARS OF THE GROWTH OF THE GOING GREEN CLEANING CATEGORY HAS DRAMATICALLY OUTPACED OUT OF CONVENTIONAL CLEANERS. AND FACTOR PULLED SOME DATA JUST IN ADVANCE THIS HEARING. IN THE PAST THREE YEARS ALONE -- THE TOP THREE GREEN CLEANING BRANDS OF GROWN 30%. FOR THE TOP -- THREE CLING CONVENTIONAL BRANDS HAVE GROWN 3% -- AND THAT. GROWTH CAP IS EVEN MORE DRAMATIC -- OVER THE PAST DECADE WE LOOK FOR TO ACCELERATE AND THE FUTURE. OUR GROWTH YOU KNOW IS IT ENABLED US TO EXPAND FROM -- THE ORIGINAL TWO FOUNDERS INTO IN TWO THOUSAND ONE TO A COMPANY NOW THAT HAS OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE HAD CORN SAM -- IN ADDITION OF THAT OUR GROWTH CREATED. THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE FIRST LEED PLATINUM MANUFACTURING FACILITY OTHER WE CHOSE TO LOCATE IN CHICAGO ON THAT CURRENT FACILITY. EMPLOYS CLOSE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THE BECAUSE OF THE CHEMICAL SCREENING PROCESS YOU KNOW THAT WE VOLUNTARILY CONDUCT -- WE'VE NOT BEEN DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THE G. DGSE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM INGREDIENT LIST OR THE INITIAL -- PRAIRIE PRODUCT CATEGORIES. OUR COMPETITORS COULD HOWEVER -- BE AT IMPACTED BY THE PROPOSED LAUNDRY DETERGENT -- WITH THE THAT CONTAIN THE A AND P. AS A CATEGORY -- WE'VE NEVER USED MP IS AND OUR PRODUCTS -- THEIR ADVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL HUMAN HEALTH EFFECTS ARE ARE VERY WELL DOCUMENTED. BUT THINK THE I THINK THE CONCEPT HERE THAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT -- YOU THE PROPOSED CATEGORY WOULD GREATLY BENEFIT -- THE PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA BUT KIND OF RAISING THE MINIMUM BAR. AND THE PRINCIPLE OF RAISING THE MINIMUM BAR -- WOULD HELP REDUCE THE GAP. KIND OF BETWEEN -- AND COMPANIES THAT ARE JUST -- YOU KNOW OPERATING. AT THE LOWER WATER LEVEL. SO TO MAKE THE MARKET PLACE MUCH MORE COMPETITIVE -- FOR SAFER MORE SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS. NOW WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE REGULATION -- IN PRINCIPLE WE WOULD ADVOCATE AFRICAN AND CONTINUED EVOLUTION THE REGULATION A NUMBER OF THE PRINCIPLES THAT WERE BROUGHT FORWARD HERE. BUT A REGULATION THAT FACILITATES BE TO BE TRANSPARENCY AYE A POSITIVE INGREDIENT LIST THAT SCIENCE BASED AND CONTINUES TO RAISE THE MINIMUM BAR. I THINK A CLEAR LEGISLATIVE SIGNAL -- WITH THIS IS IT WITH DECISION MAKING RESOURCES FOR INDUSTRY I WOULD FACILITATE BETTER PRODUCTS FOR CALIFORNIANS. OKAY THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT ONYX RING HERE FROM NANCY GOT YOUR MAYOR FROM BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS THANK YOU -- GOOD AFTERNOON I'M A BUSINESS OF YOUR MARIN THE SENIOR POLICY STRATEGIST FOR BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS OR THANK CHAIRMAN QUIRK IN CHAIRMAN ALAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. OF THE BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS FORMALLY KNOWN AS BREAST CANCER FUND IS A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOCUSED ON PREVENTING BREAST CANCER BY REDUCING EXPOSURES TO TOXIC CHEMICALS AND RADIATION LINKED TO THE TO THE DISEASE. WE TRANSLATE THE GROWING BODY OF SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE LINKING BREAST CANCER AND CHEMICALS INTO PUBLIC EDUCATION MARKET CAMPAIGNS POLICY ADVOCACY TO PROTECT HEALTH AND TO REDUCE BREAST CANCER RISK. ONE IN EIGHT WOMEN IN THE U. S. WILL BE DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER THAT TRANSLATE TO A PROSTITUTE TRANSLATES TO APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CASES. AND FORTY THOUSAND DEATHS EACH YEAR. CANCER IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS YET MOST WOMEN DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER DO NOT HAVE A FAMILY HISTORY OR A GENETIC PREDISPOSITION FOR THE DISEASE. SIGN SHOWS THE CHEMICALS THE CHEMICALS WE ARE EXPOSED TO IN THE AIR WE BREATHE. THE WATER WE DRINK THE FOOD WE ATE AND YES THE CONSUMER PRODUCTS IN OUR HOMES. SCHOOLS AND BUSINESSES PLAY A ROLE IN INCREASING A RISK FOR BREAST CANCER. AND THESE CHEMICALS ARE NOT JUST LIST LINKED TO BREAST CANCER. THE CAMELS CHEMICALS OF CONCERN ON THE DTS SEE LIST ARE LINKED TO NUMEROUS HEALTH ISSUES INCLUDING OTHER CANCERS INFERTILITY BIRTH DEFECTS LEARNING DISABILITIES AND OBESITY AMONG OTHERS. OVER THE YEARS BC PP HAS FOCUSED ON REDUCING CHEMICAL EXPOSURE SPECIFICALLY FROM CONSUMER PRODUCTS INCLUDING COSMETICS AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS. FOOD PACKAGING AND CLEANING PRODUCTS. AS A RESULT WE'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN ALL ASPECTS OF CREATING AND IMPLEMENTING THE CALIFORNIA SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM. WE SUPPORTED THE ENABLING LEGISLATION H. EXTENSIVELY ON DEVELOPMENT OF THE REGULATIONS AND HAVE CONTINUED TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT THROUGHOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS. AND IN FACT WE WERE ONE OF THE SIGNATORIES ON THAT PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED PETITION AROUND THE PA AND CANNED FOOD LINES. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE PROGRAM HOWEVER IT HAS YET TO REACH ITS FULL POTENTIAL. THE PROGRAM IS UNIQUE AND GROUNDBREAKING. FAR TOO OFTEN WHEN UNSAFE CHEMICALS ARE IDENTIFIED AND REMOVED FROM PRODUCT PRODUCTS THEY ARE REPLACED WITH CHEMICALS THAT ARE SHOWN TO BE EQUALLY OR MORE TOXIC. TOXICS ONCE THE SCIENCE CATCHES UP. AN EXAMPLE OF THIS TOXIC TREADMILL IS BPA. OR BEST FILLET AN ESTROGENIC COMPOUNDS LINK TO BREAST CANCER AND NUMEROUS OTHER HEALTH IMPACTS. IT IS OFTEN REPLACED WITH COMPOUNDS LIKE B. P. S. OR B. P. F.. WHICH SCIENCE IS NOW SHOWING TO HAVE EQUALLY PROBLEMATIC PROPERTIES. SIMILAR SITUATIONS EXIST WITH OTHER CHEMICAL FAMILIES SUCH AS PERFORMING A COMPOUND WHICH WE'VE TALKED ABOUT PHTHALATES AND FLAME RETARDANT. THIS PROGRAM FOCUSES NOT ONLY ON WHAT CHEMICALS TO REMOVE BUT ALSO REQUIRES INDUSTRY TO CONDUCT ALTERNATIVE ASSESSMENT TO ENSURE THAT THE REPLACEMENTS ARE TRULY SAY. FOR HELPING US STEP OFF THE STRIP MALL. THE PROGRAM DRIVES INNOVATION IN GREEN CHEMISTRY THAT RESULTS IN SAFER PRODUCTS NOT JUST FOR CALIFORNIANS ABOUT FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. AND THE PROGRAM IS NEEDED NOW MORE THAN EVER WHILE THERE WAS GREAT HOPE THAT THE RECENT UPDATES TO THE FEDERAL TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACT WOULD RESULT IN BETTER CHEMICAL REGULATION. UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IMPLEMENTATION HAS CAPITULATED TO THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY AT EVERY TURN. WE MUST AGAIN DEPEND ON THE STATE'S TO PROTECT OUR PUBLIC HEALTH. AS IS OFTEN THE CASE WITH INNOVATIVE AND UNIQUE PROGRAMS TEN YEARS INTO IMPLEMENTATION IT IS NOW CLEAR THAT THE PRO THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM. NEED SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO FULLY REALIZE ITS POTENTIAL. FIRST AND TO QUOTE DOCTOR WILLIAMS INFORMATION IS THE COIN OF THE REALM. TO BE EFFECTIVE THE PROGRAM. NEEDS. TO THE IS THE AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE MANUFACTURERS TO TELL THEM WHAT CHEMICALS ARE IN THE PRODUCTS THEY ARE SELLING IN CALIFORNIA. THIS INFORMATION CAN BE HELD CONFIDENTIAL PROVIDING THE NECESSARY DATA TO THE PROGRAM WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING. TRADE SECRETS. AS AN ASIDE OUR ORGANIZATION IS ALSO GONNA BE LOOKING AT LEGISLATION TO TRY TO TO REQUIRE DISCLOSURE OF FRAGRANCE AND CHEMICALS WHICH IN PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS WHICH WAS ALSO MENTIONED EARLIER TODAY -- SECOND MORE FOCUSED ON SPECIFIC WORK PLANS AND CLEAR DEADLINES FOR ACTION WOULD HELP THE PROGRAM BECOME MORE EFFICIENT AND PRODUCTIVE. AND OF COURSE THE PROGRAM NEEDS TO SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL. FINALLY WHILE WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM NO MATTER HOW EFFICIENT THE PROGRAM BECOMES IT WILL NEVER ADDRESS THE VAST ARRAY OF PRODUCTS CONTAINING CHEMICALS OF CONCERN. THIS LEGISLATURE MUST ALSO PLAY ITS ROLE IN PROTECTING CALIFORNIANS BY RESTRICTING. UNSAFE CHEMICAL EXPOSURES PARTICULARLY LOCALS THAT CAUSING GREAT HARM AND FOR WHICH SAFER ALTERNATIVES ARE CLEARLY AVAILABLE. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AND THIS AND THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY AUTHORITY AND RESOURCES. TO FULLY REALIZE THE ENORMOUS POTENTIAL OF THE CALIFORNIA SAY FOR CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH APPRECIATE THAT. SO NOW WE HEAR OF AN INDUSTRY SIDE PERSPECTIVE AND AND WE HAVE TIME TAKEN HERE -- EXACTLY DIRECTOR OF THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] MY GOD. I THINK SO YEAH OKAY YEAH -- MY NAME IS TOM JACOB I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA. I'M ALSO ON THE STEERING COMMITTEE OF THE GREEN CHEMISTRY ALLIANCE. THE COUNCIL ALONG WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER COMPANIES AND TRADE ASSOCIATIONS. HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH GREEN CHEMISTRY STE -- SINCE MIKE WILL SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SIX REPORT. WHEN THE DISCUSSIONS LED TO THE GREEN CHEMISTRY BILLS IN TWO THOUSAND AND? EIGHT MANY OF US IN INDUSTRY ACTIVELY JOINED WITH OUR ENVIRONMENTAL COLLEAGUES. AND SUPPORTED THEIR PASSAGE. THE BILL'S DEMANDED A MORE HOLISTIC PERSPECTIVE ON CHEMICALS WE RECOGNIZE THAT WITH TAKE A DEDICATED STAFF OF SCIENTISTS. OPENED INPUT FROM ALL STAKEHOLDERS. INVESTING -- INVESTING SIGNIFICANT TIME -- IN ORDER TO DO JUSTICE TO THAT TASK. THIS WAS PREFERABLE IN OUR VIEW TWO A LEGISLATIVE PROCESS BURDENED. BY HAVING TO ADDRESS THOUSANDS OF BILLS IN VERY LIMITED TIME WITH LIMITED SCIENTIFIC EXPERTISE. THAT SIMPLY CANNOT DO JUSTICE TO THE MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH THAT IS NOW BEING DEMANDED. WE WERE CONSCIOUS THOUGH THAT COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION OF POSSIBLE IMPACTS OF CHEMICALS AND THEIR ALTERNATIVES. WAS NEW TO REGULAR PROGRAM REGULATORY PROGRAMS IN THE US. AND VERY AMBITIOUS. WE RALLIED TO THAT CHALLENGE WITH ONE OF THE BROADEST AND DEEPEST EFFORTS EVER MOUNTED BY INDUSTRY TO ENABLE STATE LEVEL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY. THE GREEN CHEMISTRY ALLIANCE BROUGHT TO CALIFORNIA EXPERTISE FROM LEADING NATIONAL COMPANIES. AND TRADE ASSOCIATIONS THE AIM WAS AND STILL IS TO HELP DE TSC DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT REGULATIONS. THAT DO JUSTICE TO THE GREEN CHEMISTRY Là WAYS THAT ARE MANAGEABLE BOTH FOR THE DEPARTMENT. AND FOR INDUSTRY. THE PIONEERING CHARACTER OF THIS EFFORT PROVED TO BE DEMANDING AS HAS BEEN ALLUDED TO IT TOOK. FIVE YEARS FOR DTS SEE TO FINALIZE ITS INITIAL REGULATORY PACKAGE. THE LAWS MAYBE TEN YEARS OLD BUT THE TEN YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE SUSTAINABLE CONSUMER PRODUCT REGULATORY PROGRAM -- WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL. TEN TWENTY TWENTY THREE THIS PROCESS IS REALLY FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE STILL IN ITS INFANCY. THAT SAID. WE ARE NOW FINALLY TESTING THE PROCESS AND FEEL MANY OF THE ISSUES POINTED TO AN DR SOLOMON'S REPORT. JUSTIFY ENGAGEMENT AND DIALOGUE. A HIGHLIGHT A FEW. WE SHARE THE VIEW THAT THIS PROCESS CAN AND SHOULD BE MORE EFFICIENT. AND ARE PREPARED TO ENGAGE WITH PTSD AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS THAT. GREATER CLARITY REGARDING THE EVALUATION PROCESS FOR SELECTING CANDIDATES CHEMICALS SHOULD BE AS COULD BE A START. AS WOULD EARLIER DIRECT ENGAGEMENT WITH KEY COMPANIES AND INDUSTRIES WHEN CONTEMPLATING SPECIFIC PRODUCT AREAS. WE BELIEVE THE PROCESS MAY ALSO BENEFIT FROM -- ALLOWING STRATEGIC OFF RAMPS FOR COMPANIES OR INDUSTRIES THAT COMMIT TO PROPOSALS CLEARLY MEETING THE AIMS OF THE LAW. IMPORTANTLY THOUGH WE SEE SUCH REFINEMENTS AS BEING WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE REGULATORY DOMAIN. WE DO NOT SEE LEGISLATIVE CHANGE AS A APPROPRIATE AT THIS JUNCTURE. WE NOTE THAT THE ISSUE OF DATA COLIN HAS BEEN RAISED -- WE DO KNOW THAT DDT ESSIE ALREADY POSSESSES AUTHORITY FOR PRODUCT SPECIFIC DATA COLLINS -- IT'S NOT TOTALLY CLEAR TO US WHY THE EXISTING AUTHORITY IS NOT ADEQUATE ALTHOUGH THAT'S BEEN SPOKEN TO TO A DEGREE TODAY -- WE SUSPECT HOWEVER THAT THE IN THE END MAY NOT BE SOUGHT FOR THE TRADITIONAL NEED A BETTER UNDERSTANDING SPECIFIC PRODUCTS. BUT RATHER A MORE WHOLESALE CALL IN AT THE VERY BROAD RANGE OF PRODUCTS. WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE BEING FOCUSED UPON BY THE PROGRAM. AND IN OUR VIEW THAT WOULD BE A QUITE DIFFERENT CHALLENGE. AND YES WE TO SEE FUNDING AS AN ISSUE WARRANTING ATTENTION AND DIALOGUE DESPITE THE RESOURCE INFUSION THAT YOU APPROPRIATED LAST YEAR. IN THIS CONTEXT IT IS INDEED UNFORTUNATE THAT LARGER FUNDING QUESTIONS MAY BE LURKING IN THE BACKGROUND FOR DTS SEE. AS YOU ALLUDED TO AND AS YOU'LL BE DISCUSSING ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH. FINALLY WE CONTINUE TO OPPOSE LEGISLATIVE INTERVENTIONS THAT BYPASS CRITICAL AREAS OF THE SDP PROCESS. AS RECOMMENDED. THEY WOULD DIRECTLY OBSTRUCT THE FLOW OF THAT PROCESS. AND IMPEDE GAINING THE EXPERIENCE NEEDED FOR ITS IMPROVEMENT. MORE IMPORTANTLY. WE FEEL THAT THEY WOULD RUN THE RISK OF UNDERMINING THE AIM OF THESE LAWS. AND THROWING US BACK INTO AN ERA OF COMPETITION OF ONE OFF CHEMICAL BILLS. RATHER WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN WORK THROUGH THE WORK WITHIN THE PRESENT LAWS TO IMPROVE THIS PROCESS SIGNIFICANTLY. NOW THAT THE REGULATIONS ARE PLAYING OUT AND ENABLING THE NECESSARY LEARNINGS. FOR THAT REASON WE APPRECIATE THE INITIATIVE OF OUR COLLEAGUES. IN PUTTING THESE CHALLENGES BACK ON THE TABLE. WE THINK WE THANK THE COMMITTEES FOR INDULGING THIS. WE DO THINK IT'S TIMELY NOW THAT WE ARE FINALLY GAINING SOME EXPERIENCE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING THE REGULATIONS. THANK YOU. I AND MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE CHEMISTRY ALLIANCE WHO ARE HERE WILL BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS -- QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU SO MUCH APPRECIATE IT. OKAY AND I'M NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM HELEN HOLDER WHOSE -- WITH HEWLETT PACKARD ALSO MEMBER THE CREAM OF INSIGHTS PARA. HI THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY -- I AM A DISTINGUISHED TECHNOLOGISTS HP LABS AND I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF THE GREEN RIBBON SIGNS PANEL -- I WANTED ALSO MENTION THAT I WAS ALSO POINTED TO THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES PANEL ON STE CHEMICAL SUBSTITUTION AS WELL AS THE OECD WORKING GROUP. ON CHEMICAL SUBSTITUTION AND SO I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT I'M PROBABLY YOU KNOW ONE OF THE KEY ARCHITECTS OF THE MODERN APPROACH TO CHEMICAL ALTERNATIVES ASSESSMENT THAT WE USE TODAY. BOTH AROUND THE WORLD AND IN CALIFORNIA AND I THINK THAT'S RELEVANT BECAUSE SOME OF THE THINGS I'M GONNA SAY PROBABLY -- RELY ON SOME KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THAT. SO SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE MENTIONED TODAY ABOUT THE PACE OF THE PROGRAM ESPECIALLY THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM. AND I'M CAREFUL TO SAY PACE AS OPPOSED TO SLOW. BECAUSE I THINK -- SEE HOW THE HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS. IT IS FUNCTIONING AS IT WAS DESIGNED. AND THIS IS A A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT -- THERE'S NOT BEEN A BIG -- EXECUTION FAILURE THE DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY IS DONE AN OUTSTANDING JOB OF PUTTING THE PROGRAM TOGETHER AND STANDING IT UP -- THROUGH THE STAKEHOLDERS OF BEEN -- PRETTY RESPONSIVE ACTUALLY ALL THINGS CONSIDERED AND WE'RE NOT SEEING A AND VERY SIGNIFICANT DEADLINES MISS WAS NOT CHARACTERIZED BY MISSING DEADLINES WHERE WE MIGHT THINK THAT PEOPLE WERE -- MAYBE PROGRESSING SLOWLY SO SO WHY IS THE PROGRAM PROGRESSING AT THE SPEED THAT IT IS WHY ARE WE ONLY SEEN THE NUMBER OF CHEMICALS THAT WE'VE SEEN. AND SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THE ADAGE YOU CAN HAVE IT FAST CHEAP OR RIGHT PICK ANY. TWO RIGHT SO IS CALLED THE TRIPLE CONSTRAINT IS A VERY COMMON WAY OF LOOKING A CONSTRAINED SYSTEMS WHICH THIS VERY DEFINITELY IS [inaudible] SO -- THERE'S THIS TENSION BETWEEN THE RIGHTNESS OF THE ANSWER THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET. WE WANT TO HAVE. ALMOST NO CHANCE THAT SOME BAD OUTCOME WILL HAPPEN IF SOMETHING HAS GONE THROUGH THIS PROCESS. WE NATURALLY HAVE CONSTRAINED RESOURCES. AND THE ONLY THING REALLY LAUGHED. TO ACCOMMODATE IS SPEED AND SO THE SPEED THAT WE SEE THE PROGRAM PROGRESSING IS REALLY. THE NATURAL OUTCOME OF THE WAY THAT WE'VE STRUCTURED. SO WE HAVE OF VERY MUCH PRIORITIZE THE RIGHTNESS OF THE ANSWER THAT WERE SEEKING -- AND THIS COMES BY ACTUALLY LIKE FROM THE BAND BILLS WE SAW WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU TAKE A SUBSTANCE USE RESTRICTED. AND YOU DON'T NECESSARILY LOOK AT THE ALTERNATIVES. OF YOU CAN END UP WITH SOMETHING THAT'S EVEN WORSE THAN THE ORIGINAL CHEMICAL OR THAT MOVES THE PROBLEM SO YOU MIGHT GET RID OF A CARCINOGEN. BUT THEN AND UP WITH -- ACOSTA TOXICANT INSTEAD AND SO AS WE CREATED THE APPROACH TO CHEMICAL REGULATION WE WANTED IT TO BE VERY BROAD. WE WANT TO LOOK ACROSS MANY DIFFERENT IMPACTS. A BIG BECAUSE OF THAT WE SET THE BAR VERY HIGH FOR THE COMPREHENSIVENESS OF WHAT WE WANT THE PROCESS TO DO WHEN TO BE. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT WAYS OF ACCELERATING THE PROCESS WE HAVE TO REALLY LOOK AT THAT AS THE MAIN DRIVER. BECAUSE WE CAN ONLY PUT SO MUCH RESOURCES INTO IT THIS IS JUST THAT'S THE REALITY OF IT. AND SO IF WE WANT -- TO GET MORE SPEED WE HAVE TO GO INTO SOME OF THESE OTHER OPTIONS THAT INCLUDE THINGS LIKE -- WHERE CAN YOU INJECT INTO THE -- PROCESS THAT MIGHT SACRIFICE A SMALL AMOUNT OF THAT COMPREHENSIVENESS BUT GET YOU A MUCH BIGGER OF ACCELERATION OF THE PROGRAM. NO WE DON'T WANT TO DO THIS MINDLESSLY AND SO AS A MEMBER OF THE GREEN RIBBON SIGNS PANEL I WOULD. SUGGEST THAT YOU RELY ON US TO HELP FIGURE OUT WHAT THOSE OPTIONS MIGHT BE. AND WHAT THE IMPACT MIGHT BE AND AS WE ASSESS ALL OF THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT ARE GOING TO BE COMING. OUT TO THE TABLE THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT WHAT ARE THE IMPACTS IN THE COMPLETENESS. OF THE ANSWER. ON IN THE RESOURCES REQUIRED TO DO THE EXPECTED SPEED THAT WE WOULD GET FOR MAKING THOSE CHANGES AND THAT WE USE THAT. AS A MAJOR -- INDICATOR OF WHETHER WE SHOULD ADOPT A PARTICULAR CHANGE OR NOT. AND SO -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU COULD YOU AT THE IF YOU WERE TO DESCRIBE SOMEONE IN THE ELEVATOR AND THEN OF NEW SAID WHAT'S THE RETIREMENT SCIENCE PANEL HOW HOW WOULD YOU. HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE IT OF WHERE THE PANEL THAT ADVISES THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ON -- CHEMICAL REGULATION. AND IT'S MADE UP OF A MIX OF FOLKS WITH THAT WITH THE BREAKDOWN -- ACTUALLY THAT'S A I WOULD HAVE TO DEFER TO THE TSC OF THE ACTUAL MEMBERSHIP BUT WE DO HAVE PEOPLE FROM INDUSTRY ACADEMIA AND SHE GOES -- IT'S A BROAD GROUP OF YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ON THE PANEL. TWO POINT. TWO TWELVE OKAY. HOW OFTEN DO YOU MEET -- TWICE A YEAR. OKAY ANY ANY IN. ANY OF THE STAFF THAT WORK FOR THE COUNCIL. TO YOU KNOW TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND PROVIDE OF REPORTING IN -- CAMPUS THAT'S ALL THAN HERE IN SACRAMENTO. THE MEETINGS ARE HERE AT MEETINGS ARE CONTANDO YES. OKAY THANK YOU PRESENT THAT -- CORRECTION HERE FROM IV CAR WHO'S A SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH AN RTC. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY -- AS YOU SAID I'M A SENIOR ATTORNEY AND DIRECTOR FOR STATE HEALTH POLICY WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. NRDC HAS A LONG HISTORY OF WORKING ON TOXIC AND ENSURING ROBUST LAWS AND PROGRAMS TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES AND THE RISKS FROM HARMFUL CHEMICALS -- AND THEN OF COURSE CALIFORNIANS CONTINUE TO BE EXPOSED DALY DICK TOXIC CHEMICALS IN OUR HOMES WHETHER IT'S IN OUR DRINKING WATER OR FOOD HOUSEHOLD AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS AREN'T FURNITURE. THAT ADDITIONALLY -- WORKERS EXPOSED TO TOXIC CHEMICALS IN JOB SETTINGS RANGING FROM. CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES OIL REFINERIES. AND CALIFORNIA'S GREEN GREEN CHEMISTRY INITIATIVE THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM AND ITS MISSION OF MAKING PRODUCTS SAFER AND DRIVING INNOVATIVE CHEMISTRY IS THUS A PROGRAM OF GREAT INTEREST TO US. PART ME. AS DR SOLOMON'S REPORT SHOWS THAT THE PROGRAM HAS TREMENDOUS PROMISE -- IT IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM OF TOXIC CHEMICALS UP FRONT RATHER THAN AFTER THE FACT THAT IS PREVENTING TOXIC EXPOSURES IN THE FIRST PLACE. RATHER THAN CLEANING UP OR FIXING THE FACTS OF THAT EXPOSURE. IT REFLECTS AN APPROACH OF ASKING THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE USE OF TOXIC CHEMICALS. OR CHEMICALS OF CONCERN IS NECESSARY. EVALUATING THE ALTERNATIVES AND MOVING US TOWARD SAFER CHEMICALS AND PRODUCTS ESPECIALLY WITH A VIEW TO THE PROTECTION OF VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. WE ARE HUGELY SUPPORT OF ALL THOSE GOALS. AND WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF THE LEADERSHIP OF THE PROGRAM AND HEARTENED BY THE DIRECTION OF THE PROGRAM IS HEADED. FOR INSTANCE WITH AS EVALUATION OF STAND RESISTANT AND TOXIC TEFLON PERFLUORINATED COMPOUNDS AND CARPETS AND RUGS. THE PROGRAM IS TAKING ON A HUGE CATEGORY OF POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL -- AND LOOKING AT THE WHOLE CLASS OF CHEMICALS ENSURE THAT WE DON'T END UP WITH A REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTION. AND ON THE TOXIC TREADMILL WHERE ONE HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL AS REPLACEMENTS CYNICAL SIMILAR CHEMICAL WITH ALL THE ATTENDANT RISKS UP THAT'S AN ALL TOO FAMILIAR STORY. HOWEVER. BECAUSE OF A NUMBER HAS BEEN UNABLE TO DELIVER FULLY AND ITS POTENTIAL -- FULLY ON ITS POTENTIAL AND SO THIS IS TO BE EXPECTED AS WE'VE HEARD FROM DOCTOR WILLIAMS AND FROM DR HOLDER -- BUT THERE ARE SOME ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS AT PLAY HERE AS WE'VE ALSO HEARD TODAY. IN A PERIOD OF TEN YEARS WE HAVE SEEN ONLY A HANDFUL OF PRODUCT CHEMICAL COMBINATIONS ADDRESSED IN ONLY ONE THAT HAS MADE IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE PROCESS. AND EVEN THAT AS WE HEARD EARLIER TODAY DID NOT RESULT IN REGULATORY ACTION. A NUMBER OF FACTORS ARE AT PLAY I'LL BRIEFLY ADDRESS SOME OF THE ONE KEY ISSUE FOR PERSPECTIVE AS YOU'VE HEARD TODAY IS DTS IS LACK OF ACCESS. TO PRODUCT INGREDIENTS DATA. PROGRAM STAFF HAVE HAD TO RESORT TO GOOGLE SEARCHES AND UNSUCCESSFUL VOLUNTARY INDUSTRY REQUEST TO GET INFORMATION PRODUCT INGREDIENTS. THE RESULT HAS BEEN LONG DELAYS AND HESITATION TO CONSIDER ALL THE PRINCIPAL INGREDIENTS MAKING A PRODUCT AND UNSAFE. THIS CLEARLY NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. WITH CLEAR ARE STRONGER DTC DATA COLLECTION AUTHORITY INCLUDING BACK TO THE CHEMICAL MANUFACTURER. THAT'S STILL PRESERVES THE TRADE SECRET PROTECTIONS THAT ARE ALREADY IN THE GREEN CHEMISTRY Là. A SECOND ISSUE IS A LACK OF DEADLINES AND OF CLEAR REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PROGRAMS OUTLINED TIME LINES FOR ACTION. WHICH WOULD DRIVE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. THE CURRENT THREE YEAR WORK PLANS AND NOT SPECIFIC ENOUGH TO BE MEANINGFUL. AND THUS FACILITATE THE LEND THE DELAYS -- THAT HAVE BEEN UNFORTUNATE FEATURE OF THE PROGRAM TO DATE. IMPROVEMENTS ON THIS FRONT WOULD HELP WITH THE PRIVATIZATION PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS BUT DOCTOR SOLOMON HAS HIGHLIGHTED. A THIRD FACTOR LIKELY TO BECOME MORE PROBLEMATIC IF NOT CORRECTED IS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH OF REQUIRING A NEW COMPANY DRIVEN ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS FOR EVERY MANUFACTURER AND PRODUCT EVEN WHEN INFORMATION ALL HEART IS. IS ALREADY AVAILABLE FROM RELIABLE SOURCES. WE AGREED THAT WE DON'T WANT TO INTERRUPT THE FLOW OF THE PROCESS HOWEVER A FAST TRACK OPTION THAT ALLOWS THE AGENCY TO MOVE FASTER. WITH AN OPPORTUNITY FOR NOTICE AND COMMENT WHEN SUCH INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE. COULD SPEED UP THE PROCESS. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR LINE THE PROGRAM TO ADDRESS MORE OF THE HUGE UNIVERSE OF PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS OUT THERE. IN A TIMELY MANNER. THE FAST TRACK PROCESS COULD ALSO REDUCE THE BURDEN AND COMPANIES ESPECIALLY ON MORE RESOURCE STRAPPED SMALLER COMPANIES. THAT WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE TO CONDUCT THEIR OWN ALL TURNS ANALYSIS. FINALLY AS WE'VE HEARD TODAY THERE'S A GREAT NEED FOR SUBSTANTIALLY BETTER AND MORE FUNDING FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL. AND IT'S IMPORTANT MISSION OF PROTECTING THE HEALTH OF COMMUNITIES INCLUDING OF COURSE THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM. WHAT IMPROVEMENTS LIKE THESE AND MORE EFFICIENT PROCESS WE ON ITS VAST POTENTIAL AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT? THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT HAD. ME IF YOU WANT ONE QUESTION WE TALK WITH THE LACK OF DEADLINES. ME DOES THIS RUN INTO THE PROBLEM THAT THE AND THAT -- MISS HOLDER WAS TALKING ABOUT WITH REGARDS TO YOU KNOW YOU CAN EITHER BE FAT WILL FAST CHEAPER RIGHT PICK ANY. TWO IS IS THE ISSUE. HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU THINK THAT THIS DEADLINES -- THAT THIS PROCESS TAKES TIME. AND THAT IS IT IN IN LESS YOU WANT TO BLOW UP THE BUDGET -- SPEEDING THINGS UP. TO QUICKLY BECAUSE KIT CAN CAN LEAD TO ACCURACY PROBLEMS OR OR MAJOR COST PROBLEMS THAT WOULD REALLY CREATING A REASONABLE -- I THINK WE WANT TO GET IT RIGHT AND IDEA ISN'T TO PUSH THE PROGRAM TO WORK FASTER THAN I CAN BUT TO HAVE CLEAR TIME LIES IN PLACE SO IF THE WORK PLAN FOR INSTANCE. LAYS OUT -- HERE THE NUMBER OF CHEMICALS WE CAN ADDRESS IN THIS PERIOD OF TIME HERE ARE THE MARKERS FOR PROGRESS AND WHEN IT'S GOING TO GET DONE. THAT PROVIDES CLEAR TIME LINES THAT. THE REGULATED COMMUNITY AND STAKEHOLDERS CAN ACT UPON IT ALSO GIVES CLEAR GOALS -- THAT THE AGENCY IS SETTING ITS OWN TIMELINE THAT SCENARIO BUT WITHIN A TIME FRAME SO IF SAY A FIVE YEAR TIME FRAME. BUT WITHIN THAT PERIOD THIS AGENCY CqC SET ITS OWN GOT GOLDEN TIME LIGHTS -- AND DEVELOP THAT BASED ON THE NEEDS OF THE PARTICULAR PRODUCT CHEMICAL COMBINATION IT'S LOOKING AT SO I THINK THERE'S A WAY TO BALANCE THOSE TWO NEEDS WHAT WHAT'S STOPPING THEM FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE. FROM IMPOSING. ADEQUATE DEADLINES -- I THINK THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT AT THE MOMENT AND I THINK. YOU. GIVEN -- THE CHOICE ANYBODY WOULD TAKE TIME EXACTLY RIGHT AND I THINK OF HAVING SOME REASONABLE CONSTRAINTS ON THE DEADLINES AND TIME LINES -- SO THAT YOUR DRESS A CERTAIN NUMBER OF PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS WOULD THEN AT A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME. I THINK IS A FAIR APPROACH IT'S BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN MULTIPLE REGULATORY REGIMES THAT ARE WHERE WHERE WHERE WHERE YOU SEEN THAT IT WORKS WELL -- THERE ARE DEADLINES AND IN PLACE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CLEAN AIR ACT THEIR DEADLINES IN PLACE UNDER THE CLEAN WATER ACT THEIR DEADLINES IN PLACE UNDER ALMOST ANY ENVIRONMENTAL LAW FOR THE AGENCIES. YES. AND THAT'S GOOD JUST AT THE CERTAIN JUST ON THAT POINT THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACT WHICH WAS AMENDED AND AS I SAID HASN'T BEEN IMPLEMENTED WELL. DID PUT IN PLACE TIME LINES AND MINIMUM NUMBERS OF CHEMICALS THAT THE IT THAT THE EIGHT EPA SHOULD LOOK AT AND COMPLETE WITHIN A FIVE YEAR PERIOD SO. IT YOU KNOW. THERE ARE A LOT OF COULDN'T THERE ARE A LOT OF DEMANDS ON AND AGENCIES BOTH AT THE STATE LEVEL IN THE FAT FEDERAL LEVEL AND THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE POKING ADAM TO DO THINGS IN A PARTICULAR WAY. AND I THINK HAVING THAT STATUTORY DEADLINE HELPS KEEP THINGS FOCUSED TO KEEP THINGS MOVING AND RISE. TO SORT OF TAMP DOWN SOME OF THE STATIC AROUND THE EDGES MISTER JACOBS AND SEE YEAH I JUST LIKE TO ENTER THIS DISCUSSION BRIEFLY BECAUSE I THINK -- DOCTOR WILLIAMS OF ALLUDED TO IT. AN ISSUE THAT I THINK IS VERY RELEVANT OR HAS BEEN VERY RELEVANT -- AND THAT IS SIMPLY THAT. THAT OUT THERE. AND I THINK. THEY'VE DONE. QUITE AN ADMIRABLE JOB OF PROCEEDING ON THAT BASIS. TO CONSTRUCT THIS -- FROM THE GROUND UP -- IN I THINK -- AS ONE OF THE FOLKS THAT WAS ALWAYS PICKING AT THEM I THINK THEY'VE BEEN. RECEPTIVE -- TO THE IDEAS AND CONCERNS -- THAT ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS HAVE BEEN REGISTERING WITH THEM AS THEY'VE GONE THROUGH THIS AND WE'VE SEEN THE PROCESS IMPROVING -- BEING MODIFIED -- AND I BELIEVE [inaudible] PICKING UP DIFFICULT DEGREE OF MOMENTUM AND I DON'T THINKWE SHOULD LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT -- THAT THIS REALLY IS A VERY VERY NOVEL UNDERTAKING AND I THINK -- THE CHALLENGE OF DOING THAT IN A WAY THAT PRESERVES THE INTEGRITY OF THE END PRODUCT IS IS QUITE SIGNIFICANT IN A AND THAT'S BEEN A CONTRIBUTOR TO THIS. I MEAN PART PROBLEMS IT'S TO NOVEL WRITING AND IF IF IF MORE PEOPLE WERE DOING THIS AROUND THE WORLD WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE EXTRA WILL EMPOWER ITS THAN I WOULD. HEART OF IT TOO IS. THE STATUTE WAS EXTRAORDINARILY COMPREHENSIVE -- AND THE IT THE THE DEGREE TO WHICH IT ITERATED SUCH A VERY VERY BROAD RANGE OF CONSIDERATIONS THAT HAD TO BE. DO HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED -- I THINK -- CARRIES A A GREAT DEAL OF WEIGHT IN TERMS OF FIGURING OUT JUST HOW YOU CAN DO THAT ON AN EXPEDITIOUS FOR THE MORE COMPREHENSIVE THAN WHAT THE EUROPEANS ARE DOING. YES I BELIEVE SO ADVOCATE ADDS TO THAT IS -- I THINK THAT THERE'S ALSO A DIFFERENCE OF INTENT IN THE WAY THAT ALTERNATIVES ASSESSMENT ARE INCORPORATED INTO THIS. EFFORT WHERE -- HISTORICALLY OR PREVIOUSLY ALTER IS THIS ASSESSMENT WAS OFTEN USED AS AN EXCUSE TO CAN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS TRIED TO REHABILITATE THAT -- TO MAKE IT. MUCH MORE FORWARD LOOKING SEVEN THAT IT'S NOT JUST A MATTER OF I CAN'T FIND ANYMORE ALTERNATIVE SO I HAVE TO KEEP USING THIS BAD THING -- TO A MORE EXPLORATORY CAN WE FIND SOMETHING THAT'S ACTUALLY BETTER THAN WHAT'S A CHEMICAL OF CONCERN. AND YEAH. SEVERAL IF I MAY CLARIFY WHAT I WAS GETTING AT ITSELF NOT THE IDEA ISN'T TO REGULATE EVERY SINGLE STEP OF THE PROCESS FOR THE AGENTS SAY WE DON'T WANT TO DICTATE EVERY STEP IN THE RIGHT TAKE A TIME LINE DESIGN THINGS UP TO MAKE A SOME GENERAL PARAMETERS HERE. WITH THEM TO DEVELOP THEIR OWN TIME LINES WITHIN THOSE BROAD PARAMETERS SHE'S IT YOUR UNDERSTANDING YOUR THE THE ATTORNEY HERE IS IF YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE THAT THIS REALTORS SCHEME IS MORE COMPREHENSIVE THAN THE EUROPEANS. I THINK THEY'RE DIFFERENT IN NATURE AND THEY ARE COMPREHENSIVE IN DIFFERENT WAYS SO I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A DIRECT COMPARISON THAT'S POSSIBLE BETWEEN THE TWO IN QUITE THOSE TERMS -- BECAUSE THE THE THEY BEHAVE AND DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT WAYS. THINK YEAH THAT'S FAIR. OKAY LET ME ASK YOU A MISTER JACOB YOU KNOW THE ONE OF THE ISSUES IS FROM BROUGHT UP SEVERAL TIMES IS QUESTION ABOUT OF OF DATA AND AND AND GETTING DATA AND AND THE THE FRUSTRATION OF THE REGULATORS IS THAT THEY YEAH THEY KEEP. ASKING FOR THIS INFORMATION AND JUST PEOPLE ARE NOT FORTHCOMING WHY IS THAT WHAT'S YOUR UNDERSTANDING AS TO AS TO YEAH WELL LOCKED OR SLOW ROLLED AND I HAVEN'T HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SIT DOWN -- WITH THE STAFF AND DISCUSS THIS IN IN DETAIL. BUT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT -- THE ITS AT WORK HERE -- IS THE WHOLE ISSUE OF SUPPLY CHAINS -- AND THE COMPLEXITY OF CONTEMPORARY YEAH OPERATIONS -- OFTEN INVOLVING GLOBAL -- MOVEMENTS OF PRODUCTS OR CHEMICAL. AND WE DO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT WE HAVE A SYSTEM FOR TRYING TO ADDRESS IT THROUGH -- THE ITS MISSION OF MATERIAL SAFETY DATA SHEETS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT -- SOME GUIDANCE ON HOW A GIVEN CHEMICAL IS SUPPOSED TO BE HANDLED -- I'M NOT SURE THAT THEY ARE TOTALLY ADEQUATE TO THE KIND OF TASK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE -- AND TO EXT TO A CERTAIN EXTENT THERE MAY BE DEFICIENCIES IN THAT PROCESS. THAT ARE CONTRIBUTING -- TO SOME OF WHAT THEY'VE. FOUND MY EXPERIENCES WITH THE MAJOR CHEMICAL MANUFACTURERS. AND MY PERSPECTIVE FROM THAT. IS THAT THEY RESPECT. DATA COLLINS THEY RESPECT -- THAT THE AND NEEDS OF REGULATORS FOR DATA -- AND COMPLY -- AND NOW WHAT WE'RE NOT HEARING THAT FROM. THE DEPARTMENT BUT AS WELL AYE AYE UNDER AND THAT THEY'RE HAVING DIFFICULTIES GETTING DATA -- I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY FROM HOME -- BUT WITH THE KINDS OF PROTECTIONS THAT CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE -- PROVIDES -- WE ROUTINELY PROVIDE DATA THAT. THE COMPANIES ROUTINELY PROVIDE DATA -- TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION. TO CARBON TO DTS SEE -- AND IF IT'S A CASE OF OF COMPANIES THAT ARE NO BETTER THAN -- THEN WE ARE INTERESTED IN. CRAP -- I MISTER JACOB FINAL YEAR. YOU PUT FOR THE WEST THAT YOU DON'T THINK RIGHT NOW IT'S TIME FOR MORE LEGISLATION I THINK. HAVING READ THE THE REPORT THAT DOCTOR SOLOMON WROTE WE DO THINK IT IS TIME. BUT THERE WILL BE A LONG LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND WE WILL CERTAINLY LISTEN TO THE INDUSTRY -- WHAT DO I DO AND I THINK I WAS SAYING HE DOESN'T WANT% LEGISLATIVE ONE OFFS? THE HE HE HE WHAT HE WANTED THAT HE SUPPORTED THE SORT OF THE PROCESS OF THE DEPARTMENT MAKING DECISIONS. RATHER I'D RATHER THAN HAVING THE LEGISLATURE COME IN AND ASK FOR INDIVIDUAL CHEMICAL BANDS IS THAT RIGHT I THINK WHAT I THINK WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED WITH IS. THIS. YOU KNOW THIS [inaudible] AT DR WILSON'S REPORT ORIGINATED WITH THESE TWO COMMITTEES -- AND A REQUEST -- WHICH AS WE UNDERSTAND IT AND I WASN'T AROUND -- AT THE TIME THAT REQUEST WHEN IN -- WAS -- BORN AT LEAST IN PART SENSE OF A BARRAGE OF OF CHEMICAL BILL'S INDIVIDUAL BILLS YES. AND OF THE FACT THAT HAPHAZARD THAT GIVEN THE IMPERATIVES THAT YOU GUYS WORK UNDER -- IT WAS A DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO DO JUSTICE TO THEM IN THE SENSE. THAT WE WERE FINDING -- OURSELVES. EXPECTED TO DELIVER A MORE COMPREHENSIVE PERSPECTIVE. ONLINE -- CHEMICALS AND WHAT WE'RE TRADING OFF -- WE AS THE CHEMICAL MANUFACTURERS -- HAVE A STAKE OBVIOUSLY IN. IN MAKING SURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE TRADE OFFS THAT ARE OUT THERE -- BUT I THINK THAT'S BEEN -- TO WE DON'T WANT TO SEE ROUTE RECREATED. THAT WOULD END UP ATTRACTING FOLKS AS WAYS OF BYPASSING. THE INITIAL REVIEW PROCESSES OF THIS REGULATION -- BUT IF. YOU KNOW WE WE ARE OPEN TO DISCUSSING. THE RANGE OF ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN TALKED ABOUT HERE. AND IF THE CONCLUSION OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS IS THAT THE ONLY REMEDY FOR THIS IS IN FACT -- STRATEGICALLY -- PLACED LEGISLATION THEN. THAT THAT'S WHAT WILL BE. OUR SHOWS SENATOR ALLEN HAS A VERY IMPORTANT MEETING KEPT TO I WILL -- BE A HOT MONITORING THE REST OF THE DISCUSSION AND THEN THE PUBLIC COMMENT -- SHOW S. AS I WAS GOING TO SAY TO YOU MISTER JACOB -- WHEN WE DO BRING LEGISLATION FORWARD I WOULD JUST ASK YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE DETAILS OF IT? AND YOU KNOW IF YOU THINK IT'S DUPLICATIVE. FINE BUT YOU KNOW TELL US WHERE GOING TOO FAR WE'RE NOT FAR ENOUGH AND JUST TALK TO US ABOUT THE DETAILS OF WHAT WE'RE DOING. OKAY THAT'S ALL WE ASK AND THAT THERE WILL BE LEGISLATION COMING FORWARD -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR I I WANTED TO ASK A ESPECIALLY SOME OF THE THE ADVOCATES OF A OF ELIMINATING TOXIC CHEMICALS FIRM -- FROM THE CONSUMER MARKET THE WHAT IF ANY SITUATIONS TO SEE WHERE YOU KNOW WE WE'VE HEARD TESTIMONY ABOUT HOW THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM IS SUPPOSED TO AVOID THESE. THESE ONE OFF TYPE APPROACHES THE THE WORKABLE APPROACHES AS THE DUTY -- DTS SEE A DIRECTOR INDICATED BUT ARE THERE -- CIRCUMSTANCES ARE SITUATIONS WHERE YOU THINK -- YOU KNOW THEY WOULD BE JUSTIFIED THAT THE THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS JUST TOO SLOW AND THAT. TO AND THAT -- GONNA WE NEED -- TO YOU KNOW MAKE EXCEPTIONS GRAHAM. TO TO GOOD A ADDRESS SPECIFIC CHEMICALS -- BUT LET ME MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION LATE BUT IF YOU'RE ASKING WHETHER THERE'S ROOM FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ACT WE DEFINITELY THINK SO -- AN EXAMPLE IS THE FLAME RETARDANT BILL FROM LAST YEAR WHICH PROHIBITED THE USE OF FLAME RETARDANT CHEMICALS BROAD CLASSES OF THEM IN FURNITURE CHILDREN'S PRODUCTS AND MATTRESS PHONE. AND WITH THEIR THEIR EVIDENCE WAS PRETTY CLEAR THAT WERE NOT NEEDED IN THESE PRODUCTS AND WE THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR THE LEGISLATORS ACTED DID NOT NEED UP EXTENSIVE ALTERNATES ANALYSIS PROCESS IN THAT SCENARIO -- BUT IT'S STILL CLASS APPROACH WE FULLY SUPPORT THAT CLASS APPROACH OKAY I HOPE THAT HELPS ANSWER THE QUIESCENT. BUT THEN I WOULD JUST ADD THAT WE ABSOLUTELY THINK THERE'S A ROLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND I AND I YOU KNOW IS AS IMPORTANT AS PROJECT THIS PROGRAM IS AND AS LONG AS IT'S SORT OF TAKEN TO GET UP TO SPEED. YEAH IN THE MEANTIME WE'RE BEING EXPOSED TO CHEMICALS THAT ARE JUST REALLY PROBLEMATIC AND REALLY -- ARE HARMING PEOPLE AND SO. WE NEED THE LEGISLATURE TO ACT IN SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE THE FLAME RETARDANT LEGISLATION YOU KNOW WE'VE BROUGHT A LOT OF FUN. DISCLOSURE BILLS TO THE LEGISLATURE TO WHICH HELPS NOT JUST THE PROGRAM BUT CONSUMERS UNDERSTAND WHAT'S IN THEIR PRODUCTS WE WORKED ON THE CLEAN PRODUCT. BILL TOGETHER WE WORKED ON A SALON PRODUCT BILL AS I MENTIONED WE HAVE SOME FRAGRANCE LEGISLATION COMING -- BUT WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO SEE IT IS THE LEGISLATURE SIMPLY TO SAY WE CAN'T TOUCH CHEMICAL REGULATION BECAUSE THIS PROGRAM EXISTS BECAUSE AS WE'VE HEARD. THERE'S NO WAY THIS PROGRAM CAN DEAL WITH THE FULL ARRAY OF ISSUES OUT THERE RIGHT THANK YOU CAN JUST ADD ONE QUICK POINT ON THAT VERY POINT WHICH IS THAT THERE ARE OVER. FORTY FIVE THOUSAND CHEMICALS AN ACTIVE USING COVERS AND EIGHTY THOUSAND THAT HAVE BEEN USING COVERS AT SOME POINT IN TIME. YOU KNOW EVEN IF THE PROGRAM WERE -- TO YOU KNOW WORK AT FALL BREAK ADDRESS ALL THOSE HANDS A CHEMICAL SO THERE'S CLEARLY ROOM FOR ACTION FROM BOTH PARTIES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CURRENT THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT -- I THINK IT THEN IT IS TIME TO MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT AND I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE -- I LEARNED QUITE A BIT TODAY THANK YOU AND THIS WILL DEFINITELY HAVE IMPACT ON THE LEGISLATION THAT'S BROUGHT FORWARD. ALL RIGHT HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO DO PUBLIC COMMENT. SO I SEE [inaudible] TWO FOUR SIX EIGHT TEN DOZEN RIGHT -- I'D LIKE YOU TO TRY AND LIMIT YOURSELF TO ABOUT A MINUTE OR SAID BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO FINISH THIS AT FIVE O'CLOCK. AND THERE'S ONLY TWO OF US -- MEMBERS HERE SO. IF YOU CAN -- I'M WILLING TO GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME IF YOU REALLY NEED IT BUT IF YOU CAN DO AND AMEND THAT THAT BE GREAT. PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBER. JULIE MALON OWSKI BALA BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL FIRST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU I'M SURE EVERYONE BEHIND ME IS GOING TO SAY THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS HEARING. WE THINK LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT PERIODIC REVIEW IS HEALTHY FOR THE PROGRAM IMPROVEMENTS CAN BE MADE -- WANTED JUST MAKE CLEAR TO THAT THE AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL ITS MEMBERS HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS PROGRAM FROM PIECE OF LEGISLATION TO LIMITATION AND IN FACT YOU KNOW OUR BEFORE DTS SEE RIGHT NOW. WITH -- OF CHEMICALS OF CONCERN -- WE ARE PUTTING ALL OUR COMMENTS ACTUALLY IN WRITING WILL DELIVER TO THE COMMITTEE SO YOU CAN SEE THAT MORE DETAIL BUT WE JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT -- JUST ONE THING IN PARTICULAR AND THAT'S BEEN RENTAL IN RELATION TO THE ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS -- YOU HEARD A LOT ABOUT THAT TODAY ACTUALLY REFERENCE THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT WE THINK THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT THE ALTERNATES ANALYSIS. SOME COMPLIANCE FLEXIBILITY HE TALKED ABOUT STRATEGIC OFFRAMP WE LIKE TO BE A PART OF THAT CONVERSATION AND AS WELL AS ANY OTHER BILL THAT'S INTRODUCED REFORM THIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. CAN I CAN GUARANTEE MISMATCH. BALANESCU BALL THAT YOU WILL BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION. GO RIGHT AHEAD. I'M GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU AS WELL FOR HOSTING THIS JOINED ME DOWN HEARING MY NAME IS PAUL AND I AM THE AIR IN TALKS IS POLICY ANALYST WITH PHYSICIANS FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY LOS ANGELES. AND THE COALITION COORDINATOR FOR CALIFORNIANS FOR HEALTHY AND GREEN ECONOMY -- FOR OVER A TWENTY YEAR PERIOD ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN ABLE WITH TEXAS POLICY AND WE HAVE DELIVERED A CONSISTENT MESSAGE THAT WITH MOST MOVE -- UPSTREAM AND WE MUST FOCUS ON AND DEEPEN OUR COMMITMENT TO PUTTING HEALTH AND PREVENTION OF THE CENTER OF TAXIS POLICY -- FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THE GREEK YOU MISTER PROGRAM -- ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVOCATES WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROGRAM NOT MOVING FAST AND FOURTEEN OF AB STRING. BECAUSE A GREEK MISTER PROGRAM WAS BE SEEN FROM A CONTEXT OF AN AGENCY THAT IS FAILING TO MEET ITS MISSION ON ALL THREE COUNTS. AS A FORMER DTC DIRECTOR ONCE SAID THE JOB OF THE T. C. IS. TO LOOK AT THE PAT THE SINS OF THE PAST ADDRESS CURRENCIES AND PREVENT DISEASE OF THE FUTURE. THE DISEASE OF DEALING WITH THE LEGACY OF WATER IN AIR AND AND WE AGREE THAT THE PACE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SECOND WAS FACE OF A CONSUMER PRODUCTS IS BEING TO SLOW. THE CALIFORNIA'S OVERALLS EFFORTS TO FOSTER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TO FIELD INNOVATION GAP HAS NOT BEEN ENOUGH -- THE GREEK CAM SUBURBAN COULD PROVIDE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO SHIFT TOWARDS A CRADLE TO CRADLE ECONOMY AND SHOULD BE PART OF OUR LARGEST EFFORTS. TO DETECT THE CART DETOXIFY TO CARBONIZED IN THE MARKET AS OUR ECONOMY BUT THAT WILL ONLY HAPPEN WITH A STRONG COMMITMENT WITH THE STRONG LEADERSHIP AND WITH COMPLETE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT ANYMORE SOME POORLY AGENCY ACCOUNTABILITY. THE GREEK MISTER PROGRAM LACKS A COHERENT -- LONG TERM STRATEGY FUNDING AND THE LINKAGE TO OTHER DTC PROGRAMS LIKE POLLUTION PREVENTION AND PERMITTING. ADDITIONALLY FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM SHOULD NOT COME AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER PROGRAMS WHICH IS SPEAKS TO THE NEED TO FIX THE TIAS HE'S OVERALL FUNDING FEE STRUCTURE. ON THE SERVER GOES WHAT PRODUCTS REGULATION DTZ HAS FOCUSED ON THE CHEMICALS BASED LIST. OF FOCUS ON HIS POTENTIAL TO CAUSE HARM YET LITTLE HAS BEEN DONE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE AND THE URGENCY TOM YOU YOU'VE GONE OVER TO MEN OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR EACH SHARE. YES. GOOD AFTERNOON -- MY NAME IS MIKE WILSON AND THE NATIONAL DIRECTOR OF HEALTH PROGRAMS FOR THE BLUE GREEN ALLIANCE. WERE A PARTNERSHIP OF THE NATION'S TEN LARGEST LABOR UNIONS AND SIX ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS WITH ABOUT FIFTEEN MILLION MEMBERS AND SUPPORTERS. LAST YEAR I MET ONE ON ONE WITH YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO WERE HIGHLY EXPOSED TO TOXIC CHEMICALS AT ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST CELEBRATED ADVANCED CLEAN ENERGY MANUFACTURING SITES. THAT EXPERIENCE TO HELP ME UNDERSTAND THAT GREEN CHEMISTRY AND CLEAN ENERGY ARE TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN REITERATING -- DOCTOR MULTI HOLES CLOSING COMMENT YOUNG PEOPLE WERE ENTHUSIASTICALLY BUILDING CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE. ALL WORKING WITH CHEMICALS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED BY OSHA IS PRESUMED HUMAN REPRODUCTIVE TOXICANTS. MEANING THAT THEY CAN AFFECT FERTILITY SEXUAL FUNCTION AND PREGNANCY AND CAUSE IRREPARABLE DAMAGE DURING FETAL DEVELOPMENT. THE PEOPLE I SPOKE WITH WERE COMPLAINING OF NOSE BLEEDS AND MIGRAINE HEADACHES BUT THESE WERE JUST SYMPTOMS OF EXPOSURE THEY WERE NOT AWARE OF THE LIFELONG CONSEQUENCES OF THESE CHEMICAL EXPOSURES POST FOR THE TO THEIR HEALTH AND HEALTH THEIR FAMILIES. THERE ARE NINETEEN MILLION WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA TO HANDLE THE MAJORITY OF THE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION POUNDS OF CHEMICAL PRODUCTS THAT ARE SOLD EACH DAY IN THE STATE. 98% ARE FORMULATED WITH OIL GLOBAL CHEMICAL PRODUCTION IS DOUBLING EVERY TWENTY FOUR YEARS. WE CAN BE PROUD THE CALIFORNIA HAS CREATED A GENUINE CLIMATE ACTION PORTFOLIO WITH CLIMATE INVESTMENTS AT SIX POINT ONE BILLION FOR TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND ON THE OTHER HAND ARE GREEN CHEMISTRY INVESTMENTS ARE BARELY A SHADOW IN COMPARISON AS WE'VE HEARD FROM DOCTORS WEIGH INS AND SOLOMON -- DID YOU THINK OF GREEN CHEMISTRY AND CLEAN ENERGY AS TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN IS INTERDEPENDENT. YOU COULD DO A GREAT SERVICE TO CALIFORNIA AND THE NATION BY SHINING A LIGHT ON THIS LINKAGE AND TAKING ACTION TO IMPLEMENT DR SOLOMON'S RECOMMENDATIONS AND DRIVE REAL RESOURCES TO DO TSC. COMMENSURATE WITH THE SCALE AND PACE OF THE PROBLEM THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH A DOCTOR WILSON. GOOD AFTERNOON LISETTE FAMILY BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS I FORMALLY WORKED FOR TWELVE YEARS FOR AN NGO IN EUROPE ON REACH SO I JUST HAVE TO COMMENTS ABOUT DEADLINES AND ENFORCEMENT. FIRST FULL YES THERE ARE DEADLINES IN THE EUROPEAN SYSTEM IT'S A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT. SET UP BUT THERE ARE DEFINITELY DEADLINES AND THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES FOR MISSING THOSE DEADLINES. SECOND OF ALL WITH RESPECT TO ENFORCE OF ENFORCEMENT THE RANGES ACROSS THE DIFFERENT PROCEDURES WITHIN THE EUROPEAN SYSTEM. ANYTHING FROM FINES PUT BY MEMBER STATES TO THE COMPANIES WITHIN THEIR GEOGRAPHIC AREA FOR NOT COMPLYING WITH THE LITTLE. TOO THE EUROPEAN CHEMICALS AGENCY WITHDRAWING THE REGISTRATION THAT ALLOWS THE CHEMICAL TO BE LEGALLY ON THE MARKET AND THAT'S FOR NOT FULFILLING THE CONDITIONS OF THE REACH SYSTEM. IF YOU HAVE FURTHER DETAIL QUESTIONS I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE ANSWERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HEALTH HELPFUL TESTIMONY. GOOD AFTERNOON AND AGAIN THANK YOU IT'S IT'S WONDERFUL TO BE IN A ROOM FULL OF SO MANY SMART PEOPLE TRYING TO MOVE SOMETHING FORWARD HERE. ARE MY NAME IS ANDREA EVAN TURNER I'M WITH CLEAN WATER ACTION I AM ALSO AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE MIND THE STORE CAMPAIGN THAT DOCTOR MULVIHILL. MENTIONED EARLIER IN HIS TESTIMONY. ARM I'M JUST GOING TO FOCUS ON ONE THING THAT WE HAVE BEEN AS AN ORGANIZATION INVOLVED AS WELL AS OTHERS SINCE THE VERY INCEPTION OF THIS PROGRAM FROM THE PASSAGE OF THE ORIGINAL LAW THROUGH THE REGULATORY PROCESS AND BEYOND. AND WE DO BELIEVE -- THAT IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE REALIZED A LONG TIME AGO THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO TREAT OUR WAY OUT OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS OR ARE HEALTH PROBLEMS. AND WE NEED TO START GETTING TO THE SOURCES AND WE THINK THAT THIS PROGRAM IS THE INNOVATIVE PROGRAM THE FRANKLY THE WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING TO SEE MOVE FORWARD. SO WE WANT TO SUPPORT THAT WE THINK THE STAFF HAS STRUGGLED THROUGH A LOT OF DIFFICULTY. GROUND BREAKING EFFORTS AND HAVE DONE VERY WELL BUT IT NEEDS TO DO BETTER. AND I JUST WANT TO FOCUS MY COMMENTS A FAST TRACK OR THE LEGISLATORS LEGISLATURE'S ROLE. OUR FRUSTRATION HAS BEEN THAT WHILE THIS SHOULD BE A DELIBERATE PROCESS AS WE LOOK AT SCIENCE AND AVOID REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTION IS AS YOU'VE HEARD THERE ARE CASES WHERE IT'S VERY CLEAR. THAT PROGRAM -- THE PRODUCTS DON'T NEED CERTAIN KINDS OF CHEMICALS IN THEM OR THAT THERE ARE. WELL VETTED SAFER ALTERNATIVES OUT THERE THAT HAVE BEEN ANALYZED AND WE DO THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A STRUCTURE FOR EITHER THE LEGISLATOR LEGISLATURE TO ACT OR FOR DETAILS SEAT TO LOOK AT THE DATA THAT'S BEEN OUT THERE AND TO MAKE A REGULATORY DECISION. AS LONG AS THAT HAS BEEN VETTED SO WE'RE NOT TRYING TO MOVE AWAY FROM SCIENCE WE'RE TRYING TO MOVE TOWARD EFFICIENCY SO WE CAN PUT THE RESOURCES WHERE THINGS AREN'T QUITE AS CLEAR. I STARTED MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE. IN YOU REALLY HAVE. TO YOUR AT TWO MINUTES OKAY THEN I WILL AND THERE THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR USEFUL COMMENTS NEXT. AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS IMPORTANT HEARING CHAIRMAN QUIRK. I'M DAVIS BALL TO SAN FRANCISCO PHYSICIANS FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY WE COLLABORATED WITH DR SOLOMON -- IN THE PHASE OF HER REPORT IN THE DISSEMINATION AND PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT WITH STAKEHOLDERS -- PRIMARILY THE LEGISLATURE. CALIFORNIA'S POSITION TO EXTEND ITS BROAD LEADERSHIP ON HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT POLICY OF BY PROMOTING HEALTHY GREEN CHEMISTRY INITIATIVES AT SUNSET HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS THROUGHOUT OUR ECONOMY. OUR LEADERSHIP IN THE STATE IS EVER MORE IMPORTANT NOW IS FEDERAL LEADERSHIP HAS COLAPSED. THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM WHICH YOU HEARD ABOUT TODAY. HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DRIVE PROBLEMATIC CHEMICALS OUT OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS IN LARGE MEASURE BY SENDING SIGNALS TO THE MARKET PLACE THAT FORWARD THINKING ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS ENTERPRISES WILL RESPOND. TO THESE KINDS OF VOLUNTARY MARKET SHIFTS CAN PREVENT HARM BUILD OUR ECONOMY AND IMPORTANTLY REDUCE THE EXPENDITURE OF STATE RESOURCES TO RUN THE PROGRAM. BUT TO REACH ITS POTENTIAL THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM SIMPLY MUST GET MORE CHEMICAL CONSUMER PRODUCTS IN THE PIPELINE. TO THE MESSAGE GOES OUT TO MANY MORE SUPPLIES FIND SAY FOR REPLACEMENT CHEMICALS OR REMOVE THEM IF THEY'RE NOT NECESSARY. AND FOR THOSE ENTITIES THAT DON'T CHANGE THEY MUST FACE MEANINGFUL REGULATORY CONSEQUENCES. TO OF DR SOLOMON'S RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD GO A LONG WAY TO SPEEDING THE PROGRAM THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT. ONE THE PROGRAM MUST HAVE CLEAR AUTHORITY TO COMPEL MANUFACTURERS TO DISCLOSE INGREDIENTS IN THE PRODUCTS AND TWO THERE SHOULD BE AN EXPEDITED PATHWAY TO REDUCING EXPOSURE TO TOXIC CHEMICALS. FOR WHICH THERE ARE ALREADY WELL STUDIED SAFER ALTERNATIVES THANKS AGAIN TO BOTH COMMITTEES AND TO STAFF FOR THIS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION. THANK YOU AS WELL. HELLO MY NAME IS KATHERINE HOUSTON I'M WITH THE UNITED STEELWORKERS DISTRICT TWELVE IN THE CHAIR OF THE WOMEN OF STEEL. I'M I'M HERE TO TALK ON BEHALF OF THE WORKERS AND SO ON THE UNITED STEELWORKERS IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED IN THAT WE HAVE WORKERS THAT ARE IN JUST ABOUT EVERY INDUSTRY THAT'S CONSIDERED HIGH HAZARD. AND SO WE HAVE EVERYTHING FROM CAR WASH WORKERS TO UPHOLSTERY WORKERS -- TO HIGH RISE WINDOW CLEANERS WE WORK IN MANUFACTURING ENVIRONMENTS WHERE WE MAKE EVERYTHING FROM HOSE CLAMPS AND CANS TO WHITE BOARDS AND PARTITIONS AND SO WE ALSO MANUFACTURE CEMENT. STEEL. AND GLASS AND MORE WE REPRESENT INDUSTRY. AND WE ALSO 25% OF OUR DISTRICT IS IN HEALTH CARE WITH THE ANTIS PARAMEDICS HOSPITALS AND NURSES. AND SO WE HAVE ALL OF THESE WORKERS THAT ARE BEING EXPOSED ON A CONTINUAL BASIS. THROUGH THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS AND SAID -- NOT ONLY IS IT THAT THEY'RE USING SOMETHING ON IN ORDER TO CREATE THE PRODUCTS THAT THEY NEED TO MANUFACTURE. AND SELL WITH THE SAFETY AND THE HEALTH OF OUR WORKERS AND ALL WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE TO US WE DO ALL WE CAN TO EDUCATE THEM TO SAFEGUARD THEM AND MAKE THOSE WORK ENVIRONMENTS. AS TOXIC FREE AS POSSIBLE. SO THAT BEING SAID WE ARE SO CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THEY COME INTO CONTACT WITH ON A DAILY BASIS IN THEIR JOBS -- WHAT WE REPRESENTED THE WORKERS -- THAT OF THE TO POP FACILITY THAT MANUFACTURED TEFLON WE WORKED VERY HARD AS WE KNOW HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO ELIMINATE PEOPLE. AND SO ON WE'VE BEEN ENGAGED IN THIS IN A LONG TIME BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND HOW CRITICAL AND CRUCIAL IT IS. AND SO FOR US WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE PROGRAM IN THE GOALS THAT IT SEEKS TO TO ACHIEVE BUT WE WORRY ABOUT THE INGREDIENTS SAFETY AND DISCLOSURE. WE WORRY ABOUT THE THOROUGH DATA COLLECTION THE MONITORING AND ANALYSIS AND WE NEED THE STREAMLINE PROCESSES WITH VERY SET GUIDELINES TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO WORKERS THE WORKERS CAN'T WAIT THEY GETTING SICK AND THEY JUST CAN'T WAIT. THANK YOU. GREAT TO HEAR FROM WOMEN OF STEEL AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CONCERN. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M CATHERINE PORTER WITH SAN FRANCISCO PHYSICIANS FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY. AND ALSO THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHY NAIL SALON COLLABORATIVE -- EVERY DAY NAIL AND HAIR SALON WORKERS ARE EXPOSED TO A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS A WITH CHEMICALS LINKED TO CANCER REPRODUCTIVE AND RESPIRATORY HARMON OTHER CHRONIC HARM. THEIR AT THESE JOBS SIX SEVEN DAYS A WEEK SOMETIMES AS MANY AS TEN HOURS TODAY -- WE DO KNOW THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS OR ON THE RADAR AND DTS C. IN THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM -- BUT IT'S BEEN ON THERE REYES AND FIFTEEN CLEARLY -- ADDED TO RESOURCES SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE -- BOLSTER STAFF -- IMPROVE THEIR ABILITY TO CALL IN DATA UP WITH GREATER ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES -- WE ARE CONFIDENT WOULD HELP WITH ANY ISSUES THAT THERE MAY BE WITH -- THE PACE OF THE PROGRAM -- WE URGE LEGISLATIVE ACTION TO BRING THESE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM. BUT WE ALSO AGREE WITH OTHER COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE SAID THERE ARE THERE IS THERE ARE TIMES AND PLACES FOR THE LEGISLATURE. TO TAKE DIRECT ACTION ON SOME OF THE WORST CHEMICALS IN PRODUCTS INCLUDING COSMETIC PRODUCTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. HI THANK YOU MY NAME IS JAN JACKSON I'M WITH THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO AND THE TOXICS REDUCTION PROGRAM MANAGER FOR THE CITY'S DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT. AND JUST THE FACT THAT I HAVE THE TOXICS REDUCTION PROGRAM MANAGER ROLE INDICATES THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- TO BUT WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S SUPER IMPORTANT FOR THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE HAVE A HUGE STAKE AND THE VIABILITY AND SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM. AND SO WE SUPPORT MANY OF THE PUBLIC PROCESSES WE ATTENDED HEARINGS WE PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT. PRODUCTS THAT WE'VE RESEARCHED I'M THINGS THAT I THINK THAT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT FIRST. YOU ALL HAVE A ROLE AS MANY OF HAVE SAID IN ENSURING THAT THE BOUNDARIES OF THE PROGRAM ARE CLEAR. THAT THEY HAVE DATA COLIN AND FORTY SO THAT THEY CAN BRING IN THE INFORMATION THEY NEED. AND IN ADDITION I WOULD SAY YOU ALL HAVE A ROLE IN LEGISLATING SO WHEN THERE IS CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT ANY CHEMICALS PROBLEMATIC AND THERE'S CLEAR ALTERNATIVES. FOR EXAMPLE WHEN LAST YEAR YOU WERE THEY AT THE LEGISLATION IS INTRODUCED REGARDING FOREIGN ANY CHEMICALS IN FOOD PACKAGING. WE KNOW THAT ABOUT 4260% FOOD PACKAGING. IS NOT FLUORINATED SO CLEARLY THE MARKET COMPARE PRODUCTS WITHOUT THIS CHEMICALS AND SO IT'S YOUR ROLE TO TAKE ACTION WHEN WE KNOW THE EARTH THERE ARE SAFER ALTERNATIVES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT YOU ARE TAKING LEADERSHIP IN THIS ISSUE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON ADAM RIGHTLY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE -- WE WANTED TO STATE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE STAKEHOLDERS TODAY -- I THINK THE ONE BIG TAKE AWAY THAT -- I HEARD TODAY WAS EVERYONE SUPPORTS THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM WE ALL WANT TO SEE IT IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY -- THE EXPEDIENCY FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE DO -- VALUE THE OUTCOME BEING CORRECT. AND I'LL JUST SAY -- ONE DISAGREEMENT WE HAVE IS THE RIGHT BACK TO THE PRE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT MODEL OF ONE OFF LEGISLATIVE BAND WE DON'T THINK THE POLITICIZATION OF CHEMICAL -- OR PRODUCT BANDS IS THE RIGHT WAY TO ACHIEVE THE OUTCOME OF BEING CORRECT WE THINK THE SAFE CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM WHICH ALLOWS THE SCIENTISTS SO TO SPEAK TO DICTATE WHICH IS SAFE AND WHICH IS NOT SAY PRODUCT. TO IS THE RIGHT FORM A WE AGREE WE COULD IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY AND EXPEDIENCY AND SO I THINK JUST GETTING THAT RIGHT IS IS REALLY CRUCIAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR DON KEPT KEY WITH MCCUE CAP CAN ASSOCIATES HERE TODAY ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION. ALSO AS ARE THE CO CHAIR OF THE AD HOC SWEAT EQUITY COALITION THE GREEN CHEMISTRY ALLIANCE A SEEMS HERE WAS A FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE U. G. CA -- SHORTLY AROUND THE TIME THAT THE LEGISLATION WAS PASSED IN -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHT NOT ONLY A C. M. T. A AND IT'S AN INDIVIDUAL MANUFACTURING MEMBERS AND BEEN DEEPLY ENGAGED IN THE PROCESS -- DURING THE LEGISLATIVE DISCUSSIONS AS WELL AS AS PART OF THE PREPARATIONS IN DEVELOPMENT OF THE REGULATIONS ABA CONTINUE TO BE DEEPLY ENGAGED ON WITH THE DEPARTMENT -- TO AS WELL AS THROUGH THEIR OWN SUSTAINABILITY EFFORTS -- I WOULD JUST OFFER TO YOU THAT AND DID YOU SEE A SAYS I TO BE SOLUTIONS ORIENTED IN PROACTIVE IN THEIR FEEDBACK ON THESE ISSUES AND REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO BEING A RESOURCE ON BEHALF OF OUR MEMBERS ARE TO YOU -- INTO YOUR COLLEAGUES HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND CERTAINLY ARE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH DTS CD ON ONGOING IMPLEMENTATION THE PROGRAMS WITHOUT THANK YOU LOOK FOR TO BE IN RESEARCH THANK YOU MISS KEPT THE FOR OFFERING YOUR HELP. GOOD LATE AFTERNOON I'M BILL ALLEY -- WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP -- WE SUPPORT THE PROGRAM WE THINK THE STAFF IS DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN DO -- TO GET THIS STUFF DONE AND AND PROTECT HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT -- BUT IF THE PROGRAM'S WORKING THE WAY IT WAS DESIGNED TO DO I THINK WE NEED PROGRAM CHANGES I KNOW THINGS AFTER YOU DELIVER IT DELIBERATE COULD SCIENCE AT CETERA BUT IF WE DON'T GO FASTER THINGS WILL TAKE TEN TWENTY YEARS BEFORE WE GET. SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS SO -- THAT'S OUR BIG CONCERN ON THE ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY ELEVEN WHEN THE BPA IN BABY BOTTLE BILL CAME THROUGH -- THE DIRECTOR DTS AT THAT TIME WROTE A LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE WAS TO THE LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY SAYING WE SUPPORT THE BILL NOT. NEUTRAL BUT WE SUPPORT THE BILL THEY SAID BECAUSE IF YOU THE LEGISLATURE FEELS LIKE SOME PORTENT TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH MORE EXPEDITIOUSLY THEN WE CAN GET TO GO FOR IT. NINE NO THEY WEREN'T REGULATIONS THEN YEAH AND THINGS WERE LAID OUT AS WELL THEY ARE NOW BUT I THINK THE MESSAGE THEY'RE STILL HOLDS. AND I THINK WHEN THE QUESTIONS WHEN YOU HAVE CLEAR EVIDENCE TO ACT IN THE LESSER TO SAY IS DROOLING SCIENCE WHAT WE DID WITH BPA WE HAD. AT THAT TIME TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE ABSTRACTS TO THAT SHOWED HARM AND THE INDUSTRY AT TWENTY FIVE SHOWING NO HARM THEY WERE ALL INDUSTRY FUNDED SO WE FELT WE HAD AN OVERWHELMINGLY CLEAR CASE YOU MAY NOT GET A IN EVERY. A CIRCUMSTANCE LIKE THAT BUT WE DON'T THINK WE SHOULD WAIT TILL THERE'S ABSOLUTELY CLEAR EVIDENCE OR WE COULD WAIT FOREVER. AS WE KNOW SMOKING TOBACCO WENT ON FOR SOME THIRTY YEARS AND EVEN TODAY SOMEONE ARGUED DOESN'T CAUSE CANCER SUS A STRONG CORE CORRELATION SO YOU WON'T GET THAT ARGUMENT HERE YEAH I KNOW THAT. BUT IN TERMS OF GETTING CLEAR BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE CAN ACT I KNOW PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THE SINGLE CHEMICAL BAND BILLS YOU'LL VOTE ON A BILL. TO AFFECT THE TAKE OF DUNGEON IS CRAB ONE DAY YOU'RE NOT MARINE BIOLOGIST YET YOU'RE GETTING INFORMATION FROM FISH AND WILDLIFE BIOLOGISTS USING THEY MUST BE RIGHT. BUT WE CAN PRESENT YOU TO INFORMATION THAT SOME CHEMICALS ARE REALLY BAD FOR YOU AND MOST SCIENTISTS WHO AREN'T BEING PAID BY THE INDUSTRY TO SAY SO WILL AGREE. SO WE THINK THERE WILL BE A ROLE WE'RE NOT SAYING WE'RE GONNA OPEN THE FLOODGATES ON SINGLE CHEMICAL BAND BILLS THIS ONE ONLY THAT OPENING THEIR THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HI A GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS THE END OFASK IS SOME POLICY MANAGER FOR THE CALIFORNIA FROM TO SCIENCE AND I'M HERE. TO REALLY ACOSTA MY COMMENTS EVER MADE BY WHENEVER MEMBER ANY PATIENTS -- PHYSICIANS FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY THE LA CHAPTER IN THE SPECIFICALLY JUST EMPHASIZING THAT LOOKING AT THIS PROGRAM IS REALLY CRITICAL. ON BUT ALSO HAVING OF UNDERSTANDING BOTH FOR THE SAME CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM IN THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM LOOKING AT THROUGH MORE HOW WE CAN ACTUALLY INVENTS A MOMENT SUCH AS THE POLICIES IN THOSE PROGRAMS WERE LOOKING AT THE PRE SHUFFLING. BUT ALSO BE MINDFUL THERE'S A LARGER CONVERSATION HAPPENING ABOUT HE'S HE'S TTC OVERALL IN THE REFORM THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN TO REALLY LOOKING AT HOW THIS PROGRAM CAN ACTUALLY FIT IN THAT CONVERSATION UP WHEN WE ACTUALLY LOOK AT HOW DO WE LOOK AT THE ENTIRE DEPARTMENT AND THE DIFFERENT. THIS COMMITTEE I KNOW WITH THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ON REALLY CLOSE IN THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS THANK YOU. SO I I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE WHO TESTIFIED AND ALSO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO GAVE ME THEIR PUBLIC COMMENTS -- THE I'M SURE THERE WILL BE BILLS LIES THERE WAS LAST YEAR ON THE BANNING OF THE FLAME RETARDANT MATERIALS ON THE GROUNDS THAT THEY WEREN'T NEEDED WHEN YOU GET THAT KIND OF ADVICE FROM THE FIREFIGHTERS IT'S HARD TO IGNORE. ON THE OTHER HAND I ALSO HEARD FROM PEOPLE IN THE TESTIMONY HERE INCLUDING PEOPLE WHO ARE ADVOCATES ARE. CONCERNED ABOUT BREAST CANCER. THAT YOU HAVE A PROBLEM IF YOU BAND B. P. A AND THEN THERE'S A SUBSTITUTION OF B. PS I'M NOT EVEN SURE WHAT THAT IS BUT THEY SAID IT'S JUST AS DANGEROUS SO I THINK. YOU KNOW IT'S ONE THING TO SAY WE DON'T WANT ANY CHEMICAL. THAT'S PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD. BUT YOU KNOW WHEN IT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING WHERE WERE BANNING ONE CHEMICAL AND WE MIGHT GET SOMETHING JUST AS BAD I THINK WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL. AND THAT'S A MAJOR REASON WHY WE NEED GREEN CHEMISTRY AND WHY WE REALLY HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHEN WE LOOK AT INDIVIDUAL BILLS. THAT WE ARE VERY CAREFUL -- SHE CHIU -- I WOULD SAY REFERRED THEM WHICH ACCORDING TO THE TESTIMONY WE HAD DE HERE TODAY. THAT WE REFERRED THEM TO THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM TO REALLY LOOK AT THE ALTERNATIVES -- PARTICULARLY FOR REALLY SURE THAT'S A CHEMICAL THAT SHOULDN'T BE SOMEWHERE. THAT WOULD PUT IT TO THE HEAD OF THE LINE FOR THE DEVS AND I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT. IN MANY CASES IT WILL BE IMPORTANT TO DO -- DIFFICULT CASES WHERE THERE'S SCIENTIFIC UNCERTAINTY -- HOW DO WE INTEGRATE THAT INTO THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM RATHER THAN MAKING IT A? PRIORITY CHEMICAL HOW DO WE ASK THEM. SHOULD THIS BE A PRIORITY CHEMICAL I'M NOT QUITE SURE YET AND WE DON'T HAVE THE WE DO HAVE SOMEONE PERHAPS. COULD YOU COME UP. OF SIR I KNOW YOU'RE IN CHARGE OF THIS PROGRAM. IF THE LEGISLATURE IS CONCERNED THAT A CHEMICAL COULD BE HARMFUL. BUT THEY'RE NOT READY YET TO SAY FOR SURE IT IS IS THERE AWAY YOUR PROGRAM CAN ADDRESS IT. AND HOW WOULD WE CRAFT THAT LEGISLATION. FOR THE FIRST AM I JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT OUR PROCESS OF SELECTING PRODUCTS AND EVALUATING. WHAT WE PUT IN OUR WORK PLAN AND VALUING SPECIFIC CHEMICALS IS A VERY OPEN AND TRANSPARENT PROCESS IS SO EVERYONE'S WELCOME TO PARTICIPATE THAT WHETHER YOU'RE? CARRYING A BILL YOUR WORK REPRESENT ADVOCACY GROUP FOR AN INDUSTRY REPRESENTED BECAUSE SOMEONE ALLUDED TO WE SAY INFORMATIONS ACQUIRE THE REAL REALLY FOCUS ON GETTING GOOD INFORMATION -- AND SO IF YOU HAVE A INFORMALLY FORMALLY IF YOU PASS A BILL YOU COULDN'T. YOU KNOW YOU CAN FORCE US TO LOOK AT SOMETHING AND AND OUR PROCESS E CAN GIVE JUST GIVE US A PETITION SO THERE'S A VARIETY OF WAYS THAT YOU CAN. WRITE YOUR CONCERNS KNOWN -- IN THE OKAY SO IF WE WERE TO PASS A BILL BY. AND WE WEREN'T SURE IT WAS A PROBLEM IF IT'S A PROBLEM WE SHOULD IF WE'RE SURE IT'S A PROBLEM WE CAN MAKE IT A PRIORITY PRODUCT. INSTANTLY AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT ALTERNATIVES IF WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT DO WE SAY IN THE BILL. WHAT DO WE ASK YOU TO DO? WELL I THINK IT MANY TIMES A LEGISLATURE ASKED US TO INVESTIGATE. OR DO A STUDY ON SOMETHING AND WE COULD DO THAT AND THERE'S DIFFERENT ENTRY POINTS IN OUR PROCESS ONE IS IN OUR WORK PLAN YOU COULD ASK THAT WE PUT SOMETHING IN A WORK PLAN. CATEGORY OR CLASS OF PROP OF CHEMICALS FOR EXAMPLE -- SO THAT'S ONE POINT IN THE PROCESS AND AND ANOTHER POINT IS WHEN WE ACTUALLY DETERMINE SOMETHING IS A PRIORITY PRODUCT. THAT FRANK DIRECTED US TO LEGISLATION -- TO DO THAT WE COULD ADOPT THE PARTY PRODUCT AND AS SOMEONE POINTED OUT OKAY SO -- FOR THE CASE WHERE I'M TALKING ABOUT WE'RE NOT SURE IT'S RIGHT. THEN WE ASK YOU TO PUT IN YOUR WORK PLAN. I THINK THERE WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE PLACE TO LOOK BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE WE IDENTIFY THOSE CATEGORIES BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THERE'S EVIDENCE OUT THERE IN ONE SHAPE. OR ANOTHER TO ONE DEGREE OR ANOTHER TO SUGGEST THIS IS AN AREA THAT WARRANTS US LOOKING AT IT. THEN WE ADOPT OUR POLICY PRIORITIES TO HELP US. YOU KNOW FIFTY THOSE TO HUNDREDS SOMETIMES THOUSANDS OF CATEGORY OF PRODUCTS IN THAT CATEGORY -- BUT WE'RE GOING TO TELL YOU IT'S PRIORITY PERIOD. WELL WE MIGHT YOU KNOW YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING IN MIND BUT I'M JUST SAYING IF WE DID YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY I'D BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T POINT OUT THAT. YOU KNOW WE DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE RETAIN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DISCRETION IN LOOKING AT OUR LIMITED RESOURCES AND THE THINGS THAT OUR WORK PLAN. AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW ANY BILL WE WOULD LOOK AT THAT ON ITS MERIT AND EVALUATE ITS FISCAL IMPACT AND THINGS LIKE THAT. OKAY THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT I THINK WE'RE DONE. AND I WANNA OUR WAITRESS -- I HAVE CLOSING REMARKS -- AS A REMINDER WILL KEEP THE COMMITTEE RECORD OPEN FOR TWO WEEKS TO FEBRUARY TWENTY SIX FOR ADDITIONAL WRITTEN COMMENTS SOME OF THE MORE PROMISED ALREADY -- SHOULD YOU STILL LIKE TO SUBMIT WRITTEN PUBLIC COMMENT. PLEASE CONTACT MY STAFF P. ESTRADA SHE I UNDERSTOOD YOU STAND UP. VERY IMPORTANT PART OF MY STAFF. AND SHE WILL DEFINITELY PUT THAT IN A PLACE WERE WE CAN ALL TAKE A LOOK AT IT -- ONCE AGAIN I HAVE I I I LEARNED A LOT TODAY I THINK THIS IS DEFINITELY GOING TO INFLUENCE THE DIRECTION THAT WE GO AS WE LOOK FOR REVISIONS TO THE PROGRAM. AND WE ARE GOING TO TRY AND SPEED THINGS UP -- I DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH QUESTION ABOUT THAT PART OF IT CAN BE RESOURCES OTHERS COULD BE. TAKING A LOOK AT WELL VALIDATED STUDIES WERE AND BRING A PRODUCT MORE CLOSELY INTO. A PRIORITY PRODUCT IF THERE'S GOOD RESEARCH OUTSIDE HIS APARTMENT. THESE A VARIETY OF THINGS WHICH WE WANT TO GET INPUT FROM FROM BOTH INDUSTRY ACT ACADEMIA AND OF COURSE THE DEPARTMENT ITSELF AS WE LOCK. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN AND I'M GOING TO CLOSE THE HEARING
