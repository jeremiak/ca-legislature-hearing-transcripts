INTRODUCING THIS BILL WE THINK

00:07:09.195 --> 00:07:10.863
IT CAN SIGNIFICANTLY ADVANCE

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.565
RESEARCH ON THE DYNAMICS OF

PROCESSES LEADING UP THE CLIFF

00:08:07.587 --> 00:08:11.357
FAILURES. BY DOING TWO THINGS

00:08:11.424 --> 00:08:12.725
FIRST WE WILL ACCELERATE THE

MEASUREMENTS INTO A GROWING

00:08:23.936 --> 00:08:25.805

THEY ARE MOST LIKELY TO OCCUR

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:33.779
IN THE FUTURE. NO KEY GOAL IS

00:08:33.846 --> 00:08:35.581
TO FIND OUT IF ANY SIGNATURE

00:08:35.648 --> 00:08:37.750
EXISTS THAT COULD FORETELL OF

00:08:37.817 --> 00:08:39.485
HEIGHTENED RISK IN SPECIFIC

00:08:39.552 --> 00:08:43.256

I'VE BEEN. THAT QUESTION- I

00:21:20.712 --> 00:21:21.279
THINK TALKING BY TWO SEPARATE

00:21:21.346 --> 00:21:22.914
THINGS ABI- TALKING ABOUT

00:21:22.981 --> 00:21:25.050
INDIVIDUALS WHO WISH TO CHANGE

00:21:25.117 --> 00:21:26.184
THEIR NAME FROM A FORMER DEBT

00:21:26.251 --> 00:21:28.654
NAME. SO ASSUMING THEY ARE THAT

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.988
INDIVIDUAL THERE IS NO EXAMPLE

00:21:30.055 --> 00:21:31.556
OF FRAUD I SUSPECT WHAT YOU'RE

00:21:31.623 --> 00:21:32.991
TALKING ABOUT. NO OBVIOUSLY

00:21:33.058 --> 00:21:34.926
FRAUD IS ON OUR MINDS BECAUSE

00:21:34.993 --> 00:21:35.494
WE'RE SEEING THAT A LOT OF

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.763
CONTACTS AND- IN IF SOMEONE

00:21:37.829 --> 00:21:38.964
WERE TO TRY TO IMPERSONATE

00:21:39.031 --> 00:21:40.632
ANOTHER COLLEGE STUDENT AND GET

00:21:40.699 --> 00:21:42.467
A TRANSCRIPT. IN MY MIND THAT

00:21:42.534 --> 00:21:43.602
IS A DIFFERENT SET OF ISSUES

00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:45.404
AND WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE HERE-

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:46.738
PROBABLY A DIFFERENCE OF THE

00:21:46.805 --> 00:21:47.506
BILL'S DIFFERENT SORT OF

00:21:47.572 --> 00:21:50.275
POLICIES. I'M ASSUMING THAT OUR

00:21:50.342 --> 00:21:51.977
PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. HAVE

00:21:52.044 --> 00:21:53.178
SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE TO MAKE

00:21:53.245 --> 00:21:55.614
SURE THAT- THAT THAT DOESN'T

00:21:55.681 --> 00:21:57.215
HAPPEN BUT HAPPY TO ASK MORE

00:21:57.282 --> 00:21:58.250
ABOUT WHAT THE STATE COURTS ARE

00:21:58.316 --> 00:22:00.285
TO ENSURE THAT- THAT SOMEONE

00:22:00.352 --> 00:22:02.020
CAN'T COME IN PERSON BECAUSE I

00:22:02.087 --> 00:22:04.122
SUSPECT THAT- IF THAT CAN

00:22:04.189 --> 00:22:06.124
HAPPEN. WHEN THE SITUATION CAN

00:22:06.191 --> 00:22:07.092
HAPPEN IN MANY SITUATIONS SOME

00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:08.727

RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE OTHER

00:43:00.144 --> 00:43:01.679
PEOPLE ON THE BOARD. I THINK

00:43:01.745 --> 00:43:03.847
WE- I THINK COMMON SENSE OF

00:43:03.914 --> 00:43:05.015
MOST OF THE TIME WOULD INDICATE

00:43:05.082 --> 00:43:06.583
THAT. PEOPLE THAT OUR REGULAR

00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:09.286
MEMBERS AND ATTEND REGULARLY-

00:43:09.353 --> 00:43:15.893
UNDERSTAND. ALL OF THE ISSUES

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.795
ARE GOING TO BE MORE OR- LAW-

00:43:17.861 --> 00:43:19.296
THAN SOME WHO HAS NOT ABLE TO

00:43:19.363 --> 00:43:21.799
BE THERE. IT'S NOT TO ARE SOFT.

00:43:21.865 --> 00:43:23.701
AND IF I MAY CENTER AYE WITH

00:43:23.767 --> 00:43:25.436
THIS BILLS TO DO YOU WHAT YOU

00:43:25.502 --> 00:43:26.570
WERE SAYING IS CORRECT A CAN GO

00:43:26.637 --> 00:43:27.638
ATTACK. BUT THIS WOULD HAVE

00:43:27.705 --> 00:43:28.906
GIVE THEM THE BILL TO BE ON THE

00:43:28.973 --> 00:43:30.107
BOARD AND BE A PART OF OUR

00:43:30.174 --> 00:43:31.775
WHICH IS MORE INCLUSIVE THAN

00:43:31.842 --> 00:43:33.177
JUST ATTENDING THE MEETING YEAH

00:43:33.243 --> 00:43:34.845
AND I DO FIND THAT FAIRLY

00:43:34.912 --> 00:43:36.580
COMPELLING TO ME BECAUSE I

00:43:36.647 --> 00:43:37.448
RECOGNIZE THE VALUE THAT THAT

00:43:37.514 --> 00:43:39.817
BRINGS- BUT CERTAINLY WE WANT

00:43:39.883 --> 00:43:40.951
TO BE SURE THAT MEMBERS OF THE

00:43:41.018 --> 00:43:41.719
PUBLIC WITHIN THEIR OWN NUMBER

00:43:41.785 --> 00:43:43.420
THE BORDER NOT HAVE ACCESS TO

00:43:43.487 --> 00:43:45.689
ALL THE MATERIALS. AND ACCESS

00:43:45.756 --> 00:43:47.825
TO ALL THE MEMBERS- TO BE ABLE

00:43:47.891 --> 00:43:49.593
TO ENGAGE AND- BUT I DO THINK

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:51.662
THAT THE- THE SEAT AT THE TABLE

00:43:51.729 --> 00:43:55.366
IS A VALUABLE THING. AND I

00:43:55.432 --> 00:43:56.967
GUESS SO I'M HAPPY TO LOSE

00:43:57.034 --> 00:43:58.569
ABILITY AND MOVE IT FORWARD

00:43:58.635 --> 00:44:00.304
THAT INDUSTRY SELLING THEM BUT

00:44:00.371 --> 00:44:02.039
I WOULD ALSO JOIN WITH MY

00:44:02.106 --> 00:44:03.207
COLLEAGUE IN ASKING THAT.

00:44:03.273 --> 00:44:04.441
EQUIPMENT MISUNDERSTANDING OR

00:44:04.508 --> 00:44:05.509
NOT I CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE TO

00:44:05.576 --> 00:44:07.411
SEE WORK OUT THESE ISSUES WITH

00:44:07.478 --> 00:44:08.312
THE CHARTER SCHOOL COMMUNITY AS

00:44:08.379 --> 00:44:10.147
WELL. AND SO I'M HOPING THAT

00:44:10.214 --> 00:44:12.116
BEFORE THE ISSUE COMES THE

00:44:12.182 --> 00:44:13.817
FLOOR THAT THAT THAT CAN BE

00:44:13.884 --> 00:44:15.719

GOOD MORE. AS A MEMBER BY-

THINK IT'S MUCH FOR BRING THIS.

00:44:31.635 --> 00:44:33.237
THIS FORD. I TO SAY IS A FORMER

00:44:33.303 --> 00:44:34.271
SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER. AND

00:44:34.338 --> 00:44:35.773
SOMEONE WHO WAS PRIVY TO HAVING

ACTUALLY MY DAUGHTER SERVE ON

00:44:37.708 --> 00:44:39.009
THE SCHOOL BOARD AS A STUDENT

00:44:39.076 --> 00:44:39.843
REPRESENTATIVE FOR HER HIGH

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:42.780
SCHOOL- I THINK. THIS IS AN IN

00:44:42.846 --> 00:44:46.183
A REALLY. GOOD EFFORT AND

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:48.385
INTENT ON HAVING THAT. I DO

00:44:48.452 --> 00:44:50.521
HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A CONCERN

00:44:50.587 --> 00:44:52.689
WITH THE MANDATE PART OF IT-

00:44:52.756 --> 00:44:54.491
BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE AS-

00:44:54.558 --> 00:44:56.126
SENATOR. GLAZER HAD MENTIONED

00:44:56.193 --> 00:44:58.128

OUR SCHOOL. BOARD MEMBERS TO

00:45:02.566 --> 00:45:04.668
CHOOSE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT-

00:45:04.735 --> 00:45:06.170
AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW WITH OUR

00:45:06.236 --> 00:45:08.072

DISTRICTS I DO BELIEVE THAT

00:45:14.978 --> 00:45:17.414
THAT IS ALREADY. ADDED THAT IN

00:45:17.481 --> 00:45:19.683
EFFECT. A POSSIBILITY IN OUR IN

00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:20.984
OUR IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

00:45:21.051 --> 00:45:23.787
AND I DO SHARE ALSO. SENATOR

00:45:23.854 --> 00:45:25.355
DOLLIES ADD CONCERNED WITH

00:45:25.422 --> 00:45:28.225
REGARDS TO- THE ISSUE AS FAR AS

00:45:28.292 --> 00:45:30.027
THE CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND THE

00:45:30.094 --> 00:45:33.997
LANGUAGE. SPECIFICALLY STATED

00:45:34.064 --> 00:45:35.466
TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THERE

00:45:35.532 --> 00:45:37.067
ARE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES IN

00:45:37.134 --> 00:45:39.336
WHICH THEY FUNCTION. AND I

00:45:39.403 --> 00:45:41.371
WOULD HATE TO. YOU KNOW FURTHER

00:45:41.438 --> 00:45:43.273
A- A BILL THAT WOULD

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:49.079
INCAPACITATE. THEM FROM- BE

00:45:49.146 --> 00:45:50.147
ABLE TO CONDUCT A BET AS IS

00:45:50.214 --> 00:45:50.781
BECAUSE THEY HAVE WOULD HAVE TO

00:45:50.848 --> 00:45:54.351
WAIT FOR AB. FOR APPROVALS SO

00:45:54.418 --> 00:45:57.121
AM I AM GOING TO STAY OFF THIS

00:45:57.187 --> 00:45:58.922
BILL RIGHT AT THIS MOMENT-

00:45:58.989 --> 00:46:00.124
UNTIL WE HAVE THAT

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:01.458
CLARIFICATION OF THE LANGUAGE

00:46:01.525 --> 00:46:02.559
BUT I DO LOOK FORWARD TO

00:46:02.626 --> 00:46:04.661
SUPPORTING IT IN THE FUTURE-

00:46:04.728 --> 00:46:06.330
AND LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING AS

00:46:06.396 --> 00:46:07.464
SOMETHING IT WITH THE CHARTER

00:46:07.531 --> 00:46:09.500
SCHOOLS BEING. ACCOMMODATED

00:46:09.566 --> 00:46:11.702
THERE- IN THAT IT BUT THANK YOU

00:46:13.437 --> 00:46:14.204
ABOUT THIS BILL AND I LOOK

00:46:14.271 --> 00:46:16.607
FORWARD TO AND HOPEFULLY

00:46:16.673 --> 00:46:17.975
SUPPORTING IN THE FUTURE. VERY

00:46:18.041 --> 00:46:19.476
GOOD AND BEFORE WE MOVED HERE

00:46:19.543 --> 00:46:21.178
CLOSER I WOULD JUST SAY FOR THE

00:46:21.245 --> 00:46:22.279
COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHAT THIS

00:46:22.346 --> 00:46:24.414
BILL DOES. IS IT REQUIRES THE

00:46:24.481 --> 00:46:26.283
BOARD TO ACCEPT THE STUDENT

00:46:26.350 --> 00:46:28.018
POSITION WITH A PETITION RIGHT

00:46:28.085 --> 00:46:29.386
NOW THEY DO NOT HAVE TO ACCEPT

00:46:29.453 --> 00:46:31.421
THE POSITION PETITION. SO THIS

00:46:31.488 --> 00:46:32.523
BILL WOULD MAKE IT THAT THE

00:46:32.589 --> 00:46:33.457
BOARD HAS TO ACCEPT THE

00:46:33.524 --> 00:46:35.225
PETITION. SO IT JUST GIVES THE

00:46:35.292 --> 00:46:36.860
STUDENTS A LITTLE MORE POWER.

00:46:36.927 --> 00:46:37.895
ALL RIGHT WITH THAT ASSEMBLY

00:46:37.961 --> 00:46:39.530
MEMBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE

00:46:39.596 --> 00:46:40.697
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND JUST

00:46:40.764 --> 00:46:42.799
LIKE TO ADDRESS TO THE TWO

00:46:42.866 --> 00:46:44.701
ISSUES THAT- YOU HAVE- BROUGHT

00:46:44.768 --> 00:46:46.303
UP HERE. A NUMBER ONE WITH THE

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:48.539
ISSUE OF MANDATE- I THINK FROM

00:46:48.605 --> 00:46:50.340
THE STUDENTS PERSPECTIVE AND

00:46:50.407 --> 00:46:50.974
FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE OF

00:46:51.041 --> 00:46:53.610
CALIFORNIA. OF THE IDEA THAT WE

00:46:53.677 --> 00:46:56.446
ARE IN BRACING OF THE CONCEPT

00:46:56.513 --> 00:46:58.448
OF WE WANT TO HEAR FROM THE

00:46:58.515 --> 00:46:59.850
STUDENTS WERE AFFECTED BY A

00:46:59.917 --> 00:47:01.485
SCHOOL BOARD DECISION. RATHER

00:47:01.552 --> 00:47:02.653
THAN IT BEING JUST SIMPLY

00:47:02.719 --> 00:47:04.121
OPTIONAL FOR SCHOOL BOARD I

00:47:04.188 --> 00:47:07.758
THINK IT WOULD SPEAK- VOLUMES

00:47:07.824 --> 00:47:08.358
TO PROTECT THE STUDENTS THAT

00:47:08.425 --> 00:47:09.560
HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR THIS

00:47:09.626 --> 00:47:10.294
AND OTHER STUDENTS SHOULD

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:12.229
FOLLOW LIKE YOUR DAUGHTER WHO

00:47:12.296 --> 00:47:15.032
HAD THAT OPPORTUNITY- FOR. OF

00:47:15.098 --> 00:47:16.333
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THROUGH

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:17.668
THE SENATE AND THROUGH THE

00:47:17.734 --> 00:47:18.869
ASSEMBLY AND THE SIGNATURE OF

00:47:18.936 --> 00:47:20.804
THE GOVERNOR- TO SAY THAT IS

00:47:20.871 --> 00:47:22.606
SOMETHING THAT WE WANT ALL

00:47:22.673 --> 00:47:26.310
SCHOOL BOARDS- TO INCLUDE. THAT

00:47:26.376 --> 00:47:27.644
PARTICULARLY WITH THE

00:47:27.711 --> 00:47:28.812
PROVISIONS THAT ARE IN HERE

00:47:28.879 --> 00:47:30.447
THAT MAKE SURE IT'S NOT%

00:47:30.514 --> 00:47:32.382
INAPPROPRIATE- IT'S A GOOD

00:47:32.449 --> 00:47:34.218
ADVISORY VOTE BUT IT INCLUDES

00:47:34.284 --> 00:47:36.553
THAT VOICE- THEN I THINK IN

00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:37.454
THIS TIME OF DIVISION THAT WE

00:47:37.521 --> 00:47:39.423
HAVE- THAT HAVING YOUNGER

00:47:39.489 --> 00:47:41.091
PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY'RE

00:47:41.158 --> 00:47:42.726
VALUED. BY THE STATE OF

00:47:42.793 --> 00:47:44.561
CALIFORNIA IS VALUABLE SO I

00:47:44.628 --> 00:47:46.230
THOUGHT I WOULD SPEAK TO THAT

00:47:46.296 --> 00:47:47.731
IS WHY THE MANDATE AS POSSIBLE.

00:47:47.798 --> 00:47:49.533
WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE ARE A

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:52.469
VARIETY OF CULTURES IN IN THE-

00:47:52.536 --> 00:47:54.404
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA ON COUNTY

00:47:54.471 --> 00:47:56.206
BOARD OF EDUCATION ACCESS- AND

00:47:56.273 --> 00:47:57.307
SOME OF THOSE ARE NOT AS

00:47:57.374 --> 00:47:59.042
WELCOMING OF STUDENTS VOICES AS

00:47:59.109 --> 00:48:01.211
OTHERS. AND THEN WITH REGARDS

00:48:01.278 --> 00:48:04.114

00:48:04.181 --> 00:48:08.218

CONTROL PERSON. AND I THINK THE

00:48:59.136 --> 00:49:00.037
CHALLENGE ON A BILL THAT

MATCHES MY VALUES AND THINGS

00:49:01.538 --> 00:49:02.706

I SUPPORT MANDATES WHEN WE HAVE

00:49:07.277 --> 00:49:08.879
A PROBLEM. WHEN SCHOOL BOARDS

00:49:08.945 --> 00:49:10.280

THAT IT MATCHES YOU KNOW WHAT I

00:49:12.182 --> 00:49:14.584
THINK IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO-

AND IN THIS CASE IT'S A TOTAL

00:49:16.219 --> 00:49:17.554

WORLD. THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME

00:49:26.063 --> 00:49:28.265
POWER ACCESS TRANSPORTATION IS

00:49:28.332 --> 00:49:29.433
THE COMMUNICATION IS A LOT OF

00:49:29.499 --> 00:49:31.001
ISSUES THAT. CAN CREATE

00:49:31.068 --> 00:49:33.070
IMPEDIMENTS TO REALLY. RAISING
