NINETEEN SIXTY TWO FOR TESTIMONY ONLY ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL WOULD YOU LIKE TO. CHAIRING COLLEAGUES I'M HERE TO PRESENT A. B. NINETEEN SIXTY TWO WHICH PROVIDES A COMPLETE SALES AND USE TAX EXEMPTION FOR BUILDING MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES. PURCHASED BY A QUALIFIED PERSON. FOR CONSTRUCTION OF SENIOR HOMES FROM JANUARY FIRST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE THROUGH JANUARY FIRST. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY SIX SO THIS WOULD BE A FIVE YEAR PROGRAM SO WE COULD EVALUATE ITS EFFECTIVENESS. THIS QUALIFIED PERSONS INCLUDE NON PROFITS AND CONTRACTORS WORKING UNDER CONTRACTS WITH THE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION WHO SPECIALIZES IN SENIOR HOUSING. WITH THE SENIOR POPULATION EXPECTED TO GROW BY NEARLY TWO THIRDS IN THE NEXT TWO DECADES THE MOST WORKERS I'M PREPARED FOR RETIREMENT CALIFORNIA FACES A MOUNTAIN RETIREMENT CRISIS. WELL THE RETIREMENT CRISIS IS NATIONAL IS COPE CALIFORNIA SENIORS FACE EXORBITANT LIVING COSTS WHILE THE STATE RANKS NEAR THE BOTTOM AND WORKPLACE ACCESS TO A PENSION OR A FOUR ONE K. ACCORDING TO THE US CENSUS. THE POPULATION OF PERSONS SIXTY FIVE AND UP IS ESTIMATED AT THIRTEEN POINT 1% OF THE CALIFORNIA POPULATION. MEANWHILE THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN A RP SCOREBOARD. RANKED CALIFORNIA NINETEENTH IN THE COUNTY FOR AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESS ADDITIONALLY THE CURRENT HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA'S LEAD TO INCREASE HOMELESSNESS AMONG THE SENIOR POPULATION MOST OF THE SENIORS ARE ON A FIXED INCOME IN WHICH A RISE IN RENT HIT SENIORS MUCH MORE THAN MANY OTHER INDIVIDUALS. AB NINETY SIXTY TWO WOULD INCENTIVIZE THE BUILDING OF SENIOR HOUSING IN AN EFFORT TO INCREASE AVAILABILITY BY EFFECTIVELY REDUCING THE TOTAL COST OF CONSTRUCTION. AN INCREASE IN SENIOR HOUSING WOULD HELP MITIGATE THE UNFOLDING CRISIS BY PROVIDING ACCOMMODATIONS FOR AN AGING POPULATION AND ENCOURAGE MORE SENIOR HOUSING. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE SOMEWHERE. ALONG THE LINE. THANK YOU WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITE- ARTISTS ARE OU WITNESS IN OPPOSITION I WOULD ASSUME I WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SMITH THE COURT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO THE MEASURE WE BELIEVE THERE ARE AMPLE OPPORTUNITIES- AND INCENTIVES ALREADY EXISTING IN THE TAX CODE- THAT SUPPORT THE BUILDING OF SENIOR HOUSING- AND THAT THIS IS A CONVERSATION MORE APPROPRIATE TO BE HAD AS PART OF THE BUDGET. I IN ADDRESSING HOUSING BROADLY ACROSS THE STATE THANK YOU. NOT. COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NINE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WILL TELL YOU LIKE CLOSE. BASICALLY. THE SALES AND USE TAX IS SEVEN POINT 25% IN CALIFORNIA AND WE GUARANTEE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ONE POINT UP TO TEN POINT 25% THAT ADDS THAT CALL US DIRECTLY TO ANY HOUSING AND IF WE'RE GOING TO GET ANY KIND OF HANDLE ON LOW INCOME HOUSING WE HAVE TO. SUBSIDIZE IT OR GIVE THEM A TAX BREAK AND WE'LL SEE HOW THIS PLAYS OUT. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND YOU HAVE A GOOD DAY. WHEN FILE ITEM SEVEN AB TWENTY FIFTY EIGHT ZERO LIKE TO OPEN. GOOD I WOULD SAY TO OPEN YEAH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR THOUGHTFUL FEEDBACK ON THISBILL. AND FOR ALL OF YOUR LONG STANDING LEADERSHIP ON ISSUES RELATED TO POVERTY AND HOMELESSNESS YOU'VE BEEN A LEADING VOICE IN THIS CONVERSATION FOR A LONG TIME AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THIS BILL AND ON OTHER MEASURES IN THIS AREA. AND I AM PLEASED TODAY TO PRESENT AB TWENTY FIFTY EIGHT ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUE ENJOYING AUTHOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEMBER FRIEDMAN. THIS BILL SEEKS TO HELP PREVENT HOMELESSNESS BY PRESERVING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT ARE AT RISK OF CONVERTING IT TO UNAFFORDABLE MARKET RATE UNITS IN THE NEAR FUTURE. WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF AN ON PRESS. WAS THIS CRISIS. AND THE DATA TELLS US THAT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT STEPS THAT WE CAN TAKE TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS. IS TO PREVENT FOLKS FROM BECOMING HOMELESS IN THE FIRST PLACE. ACCORDING TO LAST YEAR'S HOMELESS COUNT LA COUNTY HOUSED OVER TWENTY ONE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS. YET HOMELESSNESS STILL INCREASED 212% COUNTY WIDE. THE KEY IS FOR US TO STOP MORE PEOPLE FROM SLIPPING INTO HOMELESSNESS. UNFORTUNATE ACCORDING TO RESEARCH FROM THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP CALIFORNIA IS AT RISK OF LOSING MORE THAN THIRTY THOUSAND UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. AS SUBSIDIES INDEED RESTRICTIONS EXPIRE. THAT MEANS A WITHOUT ACTION TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WILL FACE THE PROSPECT OF THEIR RENTS. DOUBLING OR TRIPLING OVERNIGHT. IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT THIS WOULD HAVE POTENTIALLY CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES FOR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. TO ADDRESS THIS CHALLENGE AB TWENTY FIFTY EIGHT CREATING NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRESERVATION TAX CREDIT. THIS CREDIT WOULD ALLOW MISSION DRIVEN NON PROFITS TO PURCHASE AT RISK AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO ENSURE THAT UNITS CONTINUE TO REMAIN AFFORDABLE FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER FIFTY FIVE YEARS. UNDER THIS APPROACH WE CAN PRESERVE AFFORDABLE UNITS FOR APPROXIMATELY TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A UNIT. WHICH IS FAR LESS THAN THE SIX OR SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND IT CAN SOMETIMES COST TO BUILD A NEW UNIT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THIS FOCUSED MARKET DRIVEN APPROACH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO MOVE THE NEEDLE IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. AND IS SUPPORTED BY A BROAD BIPARTISAN COALITION OF MORE THAN TWENTY CO AUTHORS IN EQUALLY BROAD AND DIVERSE COALITION OF STAKEHOLDERS. INCLUDING LABOR BUSINESS TENANTS ORGANIZATIONS LANDLORDS LEGAL SERVICES PROVIDERS AND HOME BUILDERS. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY ARE SIMPLY WOMAN FRIEDMAN AND TWO LEADING ADVOCATES MARK STIVERS FROM THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP IN ON YOUR LAWLER FROM THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT THE BILL AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR AB TWENTY FIFTY EIGHT WHEN IT COMES UP FOR ABOUT. THANK YOU WELCOME ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AFTER THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT ON THIS CRITICAL BILL TO HELP PRESERVE MUCH NEEDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN OF WHAT'S CURRENTLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNDER COVENANTS HAVE NO IDEA THAT IN THE NEAR FUTURE THEIR UNIT MIGHT BE CONVERTED TO MARKET RATE. THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT IN LOS ANGELES- CERTAINLY AND I'M IN THE BAY AREA AND LOTS OF OTHER PLACES IN THE STATE WOULD HAVE NO RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO PAY THAT HUGE INCREASE IN RENT THAT THERE COULD BE EXPECTING AND TO BE CLEAR. THOSE AFFORDABLE UNITS ARE NOT UNDER THE STATE'S RUN CAP NOR THE UNDER LOCAL RENT CONTROL I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT SO THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO REALLY CONSULTING THE CRACKS AND WHO ARE A SERIOUS RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS. THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SUCH UNITS THAT ARE GOING TO BE LEAVING THEIR CONFIDENCE AND CONVERTED TO MARKET RATE WITHIN THE NEXT FEW YEARS ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP PLEASE REPORT LA COUNTY ALONE REPRESENTS 35% OF THESE AT RISK HOMES. ARE COUNTY IS ALSO SEEN THE LARGEST NUMBER OF HOMES CONVERTED TO MARKET RATE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN. AND EACH LOS HOUSING UNIT REPRESENTS ANOTHER LOW INCOME FAMILY WITHOUT AN AFFORDABLE HOME IN A TIME OF INCREASINGLY HIGH RENTS AND HOMELESSNESS WE JUST CANNOT ALLOW THIS TREND TO CONTINUE- OVER THE YEARS WE'VE PASSED A STORAGE PROTECTION AND- AND- PRODUCTION BILLS. BUT WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T SKIP OVER THE IMPORTANCE OF PRESERVING. THE AFFORDABLE UNITS THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. A LOT OF MONEY AND TIME WHEN INTO CREATING THOSE AND THIS IS A WAY TO ALLOW THE MARKET. THAT IF THE OWNER SO CHOOSE TO GIVE THEM AN INCENTIVE FOR SELLING THEIR UNITS A WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE TO THEM A LOT OF THESE OWNERS WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING. BUT WE JUST HAVEN'T PUT THEM IN A FINANCIAL POSITION WERE DOING SO IT'S POSSIBLE THIS OPENS UP THAT DOOR. TO HUMANE OWNERS TO HAVING SOME CHANCE OF BEING ABLE TO- DO DEAL WITH THE ASSET THAT WOULD THEY'VE EXPECTED TO CONVERT TO MARKET RATE. GIVEN THE CHANCE OF PRESERVING THOSE TENANTS IN PLACE. WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY WOULD REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT ON AB TWENTY FIFTY EIGHT THANK YOU. THINK YOU'RE ADDITIONAL IN AS A SUPPORT. GOOD ACTORS. I KNOW OUR BEHALF OF WESTERN CINEMA POVERTY- AS BOTH AUTHORS HAVE HIGHLIGHTED WE HAVE A LOOMING CRISIS OF EXPIRING DEED RESTRICTIONS BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT A SECONDARY CRISIS THAT THIS BILL WOULD ALSO HELP ADDRESS WHICH IS THAT. THE VAST MAJORITY OF LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS DON'T LIVE IN A DEED RESTRICTED UNIT AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE BENEFIT OF A HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHER BECAUSE THEY ARE IN WILLFUL UNDERSUPPLY MOST LOW INCOME PEOPLE LIVE IN MARKET RATE HOUSING. THEY SIMPLY LIVE IN THE MOST AFFORDABLE MARKET RATE HOUSING THAT THEY CAN FIND- AND AS WE KNOW WE HAVE RAPIDLY ESCALATING RENTS IN THE STATE- AND AS THOSE AROUND CONTINUE GO OUT MORE AND MORE LOW INCOME FAMILIES ARE GETTING PRICED OUT OF EVEN THEIR MARKET RATE UNITS. THIS BILL WILL ENABLE A MISSION DRIVEN NONPROFIT TO GO AND- IF THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY AND PURCHASE A MARKET RATE BUILDING THAT IS OCCUPIED PREDOMINATELY BY LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND ACTUALLY TURN IT INTO THE RESTRICTED HOUSING FOR FIFTY FIVE YEARS. WHICH IS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND OUR SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING- IN A MUCH MORE COST EFFECTIVE WAY THAN THE NEW CONSTRUCTION SO WE'RE CURRENTLY SHORT ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION UNITS STATEWIDE AFFORDABLE TO LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS SO IN ADDITION TO PRESERVING THE FACT THAT WE ALREADY HAVE WE REALLY NEED TO INCREASE THAT SUPPLY THIS IS A CREATIVE WAY TO GET OUT THAT AND- HOPEFULLY. A THE BILLS ON WE CAN OUT THE REAL TO OF THE CHAIR HAS RAISED AND LOOK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE OF. OTHER EXCHANGE. MARCH AS- FOR THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP IN TODAY ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA- AND PARENTHETICALLY I WAS THE- PREVIOUS ADDRESS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE TAX CUT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE TO WHICH THIS BILL WILL BE ASSIGNED- THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP WAS CREATED ACTUALLY BY THE LEGISLATURE OVER THIRTY YEARS AGO TO. BE YOUR ADVISER ON HOW TO PRESERVE THESE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS THAT ARE UNDER A DEED RESTRICTION BUT THAT- EIGHT COMING NEAR TO THE TIME WHEN THOSE CONTRACTS EXPIRE. AND THIS IS A BILL THAT WE FEEL IS CRITICAL TO THAT EFFORT. LIKE ON YOUR WE ALSO ARE VERY SUPPORT OF THE OF THE- PROSPECT OF BEING ABLE TO USE THESE CREDITS TO PURCHASE THE EXISTING MARKET RATE- UNITS AND KEEP THEM AFFORDABLE OVER TIME. BRING US ACTUALLY BRING THEM INTO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING- REALM- THERE ARE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES IN THAT. IN THAT IN THAT SPHERE AND WE THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT ASPECT TO MAINTAIN IN THE BILL. AND THEN JUST TO KIND OF GET TO THE LITTLE BIT OF SORT OF WATCH THIS BILL HOW THIS BILL HELPS. RIGHT NOW IN OUR- HOUSING DEVELOPERS GO OUT INTO MARKET PLACE TO PURCHASE THESE PROPERTIES. THEY'RE COMPETING AGAINST REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST THEIR COMPETING AGAINST. BUYERS ONE. TO DO WANT TO CONVERT THEM TO MARKET RATE. AND YET OFF. THE FOR DEVELOPER HAVE A HEART COMPETING. AND SO THE IDEA OF THIS TAX CREDIT IS WE GIVE THESE SELLERS AN INCENTIVE. TO WORK WITH THE AFFORDABLE BUYERS. AND TO PRESERVE THE UNITS. THE SELLER HAS AN INTEREST IN CAPTURING SOME CAPITAL GAINS. THAT IF WE CAN KIND OF. MAKE THEM WHOLE FOR THEIR CAPITAL GAINS TAXES THEY WILL WANT TO SELL TO OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PICTURES AS OPPOSED. TO ALL THE OTHER COMPETITORS IN THE MARKETPLACE. NOW ABA GET ACT. TO THESE PROPERTIES KEEP THEM FOR AGAIN AS WE SAID ANOTHER FIFTY FIVE YEARS. BEFORE THAT'S A CRITICAL STRATEGY TO PRESERVATION- IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. RIGHT STOP AFTER THE CAL. COLLEGE FOR RURAL HOUSING PLEASE CIRCA SPONSOR THE SPELL. VERSION I VOTED DEPARTMENT. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL IN SUPPORT.

THIS HELPS VICTIMS BUILD AND FIND REPLACEMENT PROPERTY WITH ENERGY EFFICIENCY OR OTHER IMPROVEMENTS WITHOUT CAUSING A SPIKE IN THEIR PROPERTY TAX OBLIGATION AB TWENTY THIRTEEN EXTENDS THIS EXISTING PROTECTION TO VICTIMS OF DISASTERS WHO REBUILD ON THE EXACT SITE OF THE DESTROYED PROPERTY.

ARE YOU CAN DO ARE YOU TO ANSWERING. SEVEN MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS CAPTAIN ROB GROWS CLOSER WITH THE CALIFORNIA SISTERS ASSOCIATION LIKE TO FIRST THANK THE SOMEONE FOR CONTINUED CHAMPION THIS ISSUE AND THINK YOU'RE COMMITTEE FOR ITS CONSIDERATION FOR US IT'S A FAIRNESS IN EQUALIZATION ISSUE- AS OUR SISTERS WERE IN THE COMMUNITIES AFTER DISASTERS INCLUDING THE MATURE ASSESSOR- WHEN FOLKS HAVE THEIR HOMES DESTROYED BY CALAMITY. AND THE TAX STRUCTURE SUGGESTED THEY CAN MOVE SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE COUNTY OR EVEN OUT OF THE COUNTY WITH A VERY CLEARLY DEFINED- SORT OF FLEXIBILITY BUT TO REBUILD ON THAT SITE ITSELF THAT'S NOT THERE- WE THINK THAT IS NOT A VERY FAIR EQUAL- WHEN IT COMES TO INSURING THAT FOLKS THAT. NEED TO REBUILD HOMES HAVE THAT TREATMENT WE ARE SO CLOSE LAST YEAR AND LOOK FORWARD TO SORT OF IRONING OUT THINGS THAT SHARING GETTING CROSSED THE FINISH LINE THANK YOU HAVE ANSWERED A QUESTION HAVE THANK YOU IT IS WHEN THIS ISN'T.

THE ONLY FILE ITEM EIGHT ASSEMBLYMEMBER MOM WOULD YOU LIKE TO PRESENT YOUR BILL. I REALLY BELIEVE YEAH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. ONE START BY THANKING YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE AND COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF ON AMENDMENTS THAT WILL SATISFY THE COMMITTEES TAX EXPENDITURE POLICY. AB TWENTY SIXTY THREE IS VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL TO A MEASURE THIS COMMITTEE SUPPORTED WITH UNANIMOUS SUPPORT LAST YEAR IT WILL AID NON PROFITS AND RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THANK SPENDING THE PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION TO ONE HUNDRED MILLION AN ASSESSED PROPERTY ANNUALLY. SPECIFICALLY IT WILL HELP A VERY DESERVING CHARITY FROM DAY ONE WHICH IS IN MY DISTRICT. NONPROFITS THAT DO NOT RECEIVE ANY TAX CREDITS FOR LOANS FROM THE STATE OR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING LOW INCOME FAMILIES. HAVE A CAP PLACED ON THE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY TAX THAT MAY BE ACCEPTED ANNUALLY. AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROVIDERS THAT DO YOU RECEIVE TAX CREDITS HAVE NO LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY TAXES THAT CAN BE EXEMPTED AND NO MINIMUM PERCENTAGE REQUIRED OF TENANTS WHO ARE LOW INCOME. IN ORDER TO RECEIVE A PRO RATED PORTION OF THEIR PROPERTY TAXES ACCEPTED. AT THE REQUEST OF THE SAN MATEO COUNTY ASSESSOR'S OFFICE WE LOWERED THE THRESHOLD FOR A NONPROFIT. TO RECEIVE A PROPERTY TAX BENEFIT IN THE BILL THE SAINT FRANCIS CENTER. IN MY DISTRICT RECENTLY WAS ABLE TO ACQUIRE FORTY EIGHT UNIT. APARTMENT COMPLEX ALL WITH PRIVATE DONATIONS AT A COST OF TWENTY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. THE BUILDING HAD EXISTING TENANTS AND BECAUSE OF HOW TIGHT AND EXPENSE OF THE BAY AREA RENTAL MARKET IS. THEY DIDN'T WANT TO IMMEDIATELY AFFECTS ALL OF THE TENANTS THAT WE'RE NOT LOW INCOME. AND THEY PAY THE PRICE. THE TAX BILL OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM THE COUNTY. THE COUNTY ASSESSOR'S OFFICE REQUESTED THAT THE ST FRANCIS AT OUR OTHER SIMILARLY SITUATED CHIU. GET A RATED POOR. OF THEIR PROPERTY TAXES EXEMPTED AS LONG AS THEY HAVE AT LEAST 50% LOW INCOME TENANTS AND I AGREE WITH THAT. IT'S ONLY MAKES THIS I DON'T ENCOURAGE MORE. AND ALL REPEAT X. TIGHT AND NANA. FOR MANY HOUSING MARKET IN THE BAY AREA. THIS PROVISION AS A TEN YEAR SUNSET TO MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO ABUSES. AND WITH THAT THANK YOU ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME AND I HAVE A WITNESS IN SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS JOE CRUISE ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY SAN MATTEO. SMX COMMITMENT HAS CONTINUED EXPERIENCE ON PRESIDENT MAN FOR HOUSING. THE SOME OF THE HIGH HOUSING THIS IS IN THE ENTRY. THE HELP. IS IN OUR AREA IS MORE IMPORTANT EVER TO PRESERVE AND ASSIST THE EFFORTS OF NONPROFITS LIKE SAINT FRANCIS ENTERED REDWOOD CITY. WHICH PROVIDES NON PUBLICLY FINANCED AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO EXTREMELY ROLE LOW RESIDENTS LOW INCOME RESIDENTS DESPITE RECENT ATTEMPTS TO INCREASE THE CAP AND KEEP UP WITH THE INCREASING PROPERTY VALUES THE CURRENT PROPERTY EXEMPTION CAP LIMITS THE ABILITY OF THESE TYPE OF NONPROFITS TO PROVIDE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE CURRENT REQUIREMENT LIMITS CHARITIES LIKE SAYING FRANCIS WITH A FEW MODERATE LOW INCOME TENANTS IN THE BUILDING FROM BENEFITING FROM THE EXISTING TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION. LAURIE THE REQUIRED PERCENTAGE FOR LIKE CONTENTS IN PRO RATING THE EXEMPTION WOULD ALLEVIATE DISPLACEMENT THEY CAN RESULT WHEN I CHARITY PRODUCES A BUILDING WITH EXISTING TENANTS. AS WAS RECENTLY K. THE CASE WITH ST FRANCIS CENTER AND ALLOWS IN THE USE THESE FUNDS TO HELP MORE FAMILIES SECURE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR THESE REASONS WE SUPPORT TWENTY SIX TWENTY SIXTY THREE.

FILE ITEM NUMBER TWO AB NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR COLLEGE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT WHICH I'M WORKING ON WITH SOME MY COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN WORKING ON. CANNABIS POLICY SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN WHEN WE PASSED THEM SIERRA STAY TOGETHER AS A MEMBER LACKEY AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER BECAUSE COOLEY IN JONES SAWYER AND- YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE DONE A LOT A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. WITH CANNABIS REGULATION TWENTY FIFTEEN PASSED THEM SIERRA SAY WHICH PROVIDE REGULATION FOR THE FIRST TIME AROUND OUR MEDICAL CANNABIS MARKET PLACE WITH THE GOALS OF PROTECTING THE PUBLIC IN CHILDREN THE ENVIRONMENT ENSURING SAFE PRODUCTS COMBAT IN THE ILLICIT MARKET AND THEN THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA TWENTY SIXTEEN PASSED PROP SIXTY FOUR- WHICH M. REQUESTED. THERE OF CALIFORNIA REQUESTED AND VOTED FOR A LEGALIZED REGULATED- ADULT USE CANVAS MARKETPLACE BUT RIGHT NOW. THE MARKET THE CAMPUS MARKET PLACE IN CALIFORNIA IS FAILING. WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT- THE LESSER MARKET PLACES DOMINATING NOT THE REGULATED MARKETPLACE WHICH IS WHAT. CALIFORNIANS ASK FOR WITH PROP 6475% OF ALL SALES WITHIN. CALIFORNIA ARE IN THE ILLICIT MARKET PLACE. AND SO IT IN RESPONSE TO THE VERY LARGE ILLICIT MARKET PLACE THAT WE NEED TO PASS A BE NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT. EN MY VIEW WHICH WILL CREATE A THREE YEAR WINDOW TO ACCELERATE ENCOURAGE CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES TO TRANSITION AWAY FROM THE LIST OF MARKET PLACE AND TO. THE REGULATED MARKET PLACE. IT HAS A EXCISE TAX DECREASE OF 4% FOR THREE YEARS AND A ELIMINATION OF THE CULTIVATION TAX FOR THOSE THREE YEARS AND THEN- THE TAXES WILL RETURN TO WHAT THEY WERE AFTER THOSE THREE YEARS WIDE. ARE THOSE THREE YEARS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THOSE. ARE THE EARLY YEARS WHERE AS THE CANNABIS MARKETPLACE MATURES IN THE REGULAR MARKET PLACE- GROWS- BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS CAN MAKE THE DECISION TO ACTUALLY PARTICIPATE IN THE REGULATED MARKET PLACE INSTEAD OF THE ILLICIT MARKET PLACE WHERE THEY'VE BEEN. FOR MANY YEARS SO THIS IS A STRATEGY THAT IS NOT UNPRECEDENTED IT'S WORKED IN OTHER STATES SUCH AS OR AN AND IN WASHINGTON. AND WE'VE SEEN THAT IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES A SIMPLIFICATION OF THE TAXES AND LOWERING OF THEM. BE REVENUE ACTUALLY GROW AND THAT'S WHAT WE BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED HERE AS WELL A WITH A FULL 75% OF AB CANVAS MARKET ACTORS IN CALIFORNIA- IN THE LESSON MARKET PLACE. WE HAVE A HUGE OPPORTUNITY TO GROW THE REGULATED MARKETPLACE WHICH IS ONLY 25% OF COURSE AS- PART- IS OBSERVE LOWERING BARRIERS MOVE OVER TO THE REGULAR MARKET PLACE THEY WILL BECOME TAXPAYERS. REGULAR THE PLATE WELL I ANY PIECE TAX REVENUE. THAT WILL GO TO ALL OF THE- M. PURPOSES. LAID OUT IN PROP SIXTY FOUR. SO I AM THE CHALLENGE OF HAVING A- REGULAR MARK. THIS IS REAL WE KNOW. THAT IN THIS IS THE THIRD YEAR I BOUGHT THIS BILL. AND DURING THAT TIME THE- REGULAR MARKET PLACE HAS HAS BEEN SUFFERING WE SAW ONE OF THE BIGGEST PLAYERS. IN THE REGULATED MARKETPLACE FLOW KANA REPORTEDLY LAYING OFF NOVEMBER FOURTEENTH THEN THE NEXT DAY. MAD MEN ONE OF THE LARGEST PLAYERS AS WELL THE RETAIL. SECTION OF THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD LAY OFF A HUNDRED AND NINETY. EMPLOYEES SO THIS ISN'T. SORT OF SOME. FOLKS SAYING THAT SOMETHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN IF WE DON'T ACT THIS IS HAPPENING NOW REAL TIME- THE DAMAGE IS BEING DONE AND THAT THERE'S A REAL NEED TO MEET THE VOTERS REQUIREMENTS OF HAVING A REGULAR MARKET PLACE WE DON'T HAVE THAT NOW SO. WE NEED TO ADJUST AND TAKE STEPS AND I BELIEVE THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE STEP. I AM THE- DECREASE IN THE EXCISE TAX. ACCORDING TO THE DECEMBER BLESSED- LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S REPORT. WOULD INCREASE LEGAL MARK MARKET PARTICIPATION IN A RANGE FROM OF THE THAT'S THE KEY GOAL. OF THIS BILL. AND I BELIEVE THAT OVER TIME WITH MORE PARTICIPANTS IN THE RATE MARKETPLACE SERVICE AS TAXPAYERS. I WE WILL INCREASE REVENUE NOT JUST WITH EXCISE TAX- BUT WITH THE SALES TAX AS WELL. SO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS BLACK JOHNSON LEGISLATIVE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR STATE TREASURER FIANNA MA. GOOD AFTERNOON SURE COMMITTEE MAY PLAY. OVER HALF OF TEACHERS IF YOUR MOM TO PROUD SPONSOR OF AB NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT. ON HER BEHALF LIKE TO THINK IT'S NEVER BONTA ONCE AGAIN FOR THE SHIP ONE TACKLE THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. BY PASSING AB NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT WE CAN HELP LEGAL CAMPUS BUSINESS WITH THE TRANSITION TO THE MARKETPLACE. JUST LIKE WE WOULD FOR ANY STARTUP INDUSTRY TO ENSURE THEY HAVE A FAIR CHANCE TO SUCCEED IN CALIFORNIA. WE DON'T CREATE THESE TYPES OF BARRIERS TO SUCCESS FOR OTHER STARTED TO CALIFORNIA. I DON'T SEE WHY THE- CANNABIS SHOULD BE TREATED ANY DIFFERENTLY. DESTRUCTIVE IN A STRONG ADVOCATE FOR THIS INDUSTRY SINCE THE TIME OF THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. WHAT SHE SAW FIRST HAND HOW CAN WAS BUSINESSES CONTINUE TO FACE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO LEGAL ENTRY. INCLUDING EXORBITANT TAX RATES IMPOSED A PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR. THIS IS PROVED BURDENSOME IS COMPLYING CANNABIS ENTITIES. ARE UNABLE TO COMPETE MORE EVEN WITH THE BLACK MARKETS CONTINUED ACTIVE IN CALIFORNIA. WHICH IS STATED EARLIER HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 7% OF CONSUMERS SEVEN FIVE PERCENT. OF CONSUMER SPENDING. THIS HAS RESULTED IN HUNDRED OF JOB LOSS I INDUSTRY. AND IS CHEN WILL CONTINUE UNLESS SOMETHING IS DONE. TO REDUCE THE BLACK MARKET CALIFORNIA'S ENCOURAGE CANVAS OPERATORS TO COME TO THE LEGAL AND REGULATED SYSTEM. WE CAN TRANSPARENTLY ARE THESE BUSINESSES COLLECT TAXES AND PROVIDE MORE PUBLIC SAFETY FOR BUSINESS AND CONSUMERS. I UNDERSTAND ELIOT'S PRESS CONCERNS IN THE DECEMBER NINETEEN REPORT. HOWEVER THE STATE'S BAKER THE STRUCTURE BELIEVES IT IS REASONABLE PATH FOR. TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO FIFTEEN MILLION THRESHOLD IS MET. THE STATE BROUGHT AN EIGHTY FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION EXCISE TAX REVENUE IN EACH OF THE LAST TWO QUARTERS. YOUR YEAR WE'RE SEEING AN UPPER CHAINING CANVAS TAX REVENUE. IN FACT WITH A 6% INCREASE IN TWO OF NINETEEN COOPER TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN. JUST TAKING THAT INTO ACCOUNT. IF YOU HAVE TO ASSUME THAT ANY DIP IN CURRENT TAX REVENUES. BY TEMPORARY LOWERING THE TAX RATE. CAN BE ALSO I'D BE CONTINUED GROWTH COUPLED. WITH MORE COMPETITIVE PRICING. TO COMPETE WITH THE BLACK MARKET. ONE LAST IS ESTIMATED ILLEGAL CANNABIS CAN GENERATE EIGHT TO TWENTY BILLION IN ON YOUR REVENUE AND AB NINETEEN FORTY STEP NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO MEET THOSE REQUIREMENTS THE CHURCH LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH HIM BONTA TO ENSURE THIS YEAR WE FARM IMPLEMENT THIS HAS MEASURE RESPECT AS ONE I'VE OR THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. ALL RIGHT WE'RE GONNA COME BACK YOUR TEST MY REAL AT WIN ASSISTANCE SUPPORT. AMONG THEM.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NINE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEAMAN I JUST CAN IASK ONE QUICK QUESTION IN YOUR TESTIMONY RIGHT LIKE MAYBE. SECOND PAGE- I WAS TRYING TO WATCH WHERE YOU WERE. YOU SAID SOMETHING ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE LA RIVER THAT THIS WOULD REDUCE THE TAXES BUT THAT. THAT YOU THOUGHT THAT YOU COULD MAKE IT UP WHAT IS THAT SAYING- THING THE- THE REDUCTION OF EXCISE TAX TO A 15% ELEVEN PERCENT. THEY ARGUE THAT WOULD BE A REVENUE HIT. WERE ARGUING THAT. AS A RESULT OF LOWERING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO MARKET TO DOES THE OFFSET THAT LOS. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE ALL HEARD WHAT IS A TALK A LITTLE FAST AND NOW IT'S OKAY IT WILL WE WERE TRYING TO KEEP UP I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE DON'T LOSE IT. OKAY ANA. A SUMMER BONTA WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YEAH THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS BILL I KNOW THAT. I'M THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES AROUND THE BEST APPROACH GOING FORWARD AND APPRECIATE THE DIALOGUE DISCUSSION ON THAT. AM I DO THINK THERE SHOULD BE NO DISPUTE ABOUT THE- THE THREAT TO THE CAR REGULATED MARKET PLACE IN THE FACT THAT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT. OF THE SALES ARE IN THE LIST OF MARKET PLACE AND THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE VOTERS VOTED FOR PROP SIXTY FOUR. IF WE'RE GONNA. MEET THE VOTERS WELL WE NEED TO CREATE A ROBUST SUCCESSFUL WORKING REGULATED MARKET PLACE AND WE DON'T HAVE THAT WE ONLY HAVE A FEW LEVERS AT OUR DISPOSAL. ONE IS LOWERING TAXES AND OTHER IS. A SIMPLE FIND. REGULATIONS WE CAN ALSO CRACKED DOWN ON THE ILLICIT MARKET PLACE WITH ENFORCEMENT I THINK WE SHOULD DO ALL THREE- BUT THIS IS ONE VERY IMPORTANT. PART OF THAT THREE LEGGED STOOL LOWERING LOWERING THE TAXES SO- I KNOW THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS ALSO ABOUT. MAKING SURE WE HIT THE- THRESHOLDS ASSESS SET FORTH BY THE LA I THINK THEY- THEY- PICK THAT AT ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE. GENERATION THE LAST TWO QUARTERS ARE WE JUST OF- AB MARCH SIXTH TWENTY TWENTY AT LEAST. US THAT. THE LAST TWO QUARTERS JUST FOR THE EXCISE TAX ALONE NOT THE CULTIVATION TAX. GENERATED EIGHTY FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS EACH OF THOSE QUARTERS IF YOU. I AM. REJECT IT OUT FOR A FULL YEAR THAT'S JUST ABOUT JUST UNDER THREE HUNDRED FORTY MILLION. ON THE EXCISE TAX ALONE- SO. YOU KNOW WE THINK THAT WERE THAT WERE IN THAT RANGE- TO HIT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY WITH WITH THE GROWTH OF THE TAX BASE. AS OUR STATE'S BANKER- THE TREASURER. HAS HAS STATED NIGHT BYE I THINK YOU KNOW THE CONCEPT THAT SHE HAS SET FORTH IS THE WHOLE FOUNDATION OF OUR BILL THAT BY LOWERING TAXES YOU GROW THE TAX BASE AND YOU GET MORE TAX REVENUE OVERALL- AND THAT WE ARE WE THINK WE'RE GONNA EASILY HAD THREATENED FIFTY MILLION WITH OUR PROPOSAL. SO I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU FOR THE DISCUSSION THANK YOU FOR YOUR INPUT AND- GUIDANCE AS ALWAYS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT. THIS TESTIMONY ONLY BUT I'M JUST. FURTHER JUST ON THE RECORD I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CLEAR. I THINK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BELL WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERN THERE IS SOME DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE TREASURER AND THE LA ELSE- ESTIMATIONS ON WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE THAT YOU AND I WILL CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION SO I LOOK FOR TO DOING THAT. THANK YOU THANKS. WE ARE ADJOURNED.
