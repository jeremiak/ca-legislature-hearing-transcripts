THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US OF WE CAN GET STARTED. MORNING MADAM CHAIRMAN IMUS'S LOCK WITH YOUR GARBAGE- FROM THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL I'LL BRIEFLY INTRODUCE OUR FIRST THE COURT PROCEEDINGS TRAILER BILL THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE- AUTHORIZING TRUCK WHICH TO CONDUCT ALL PROCEEDINGS IN CIVIL CASES REMOTELY WHEN THE COURT DEEMS IT APPROPRIATE AND PRACTICABLE- THE- LANGUAGES. INTENDED TO PROVIDE. OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRIALS AND EVIDENTIARY HEARINGS THEIR LANGUAGE ALSO PROVIDES THE INTENT THAT THIS AUTHORIZATION BE INTERPRETED BROADLY TO PROVIDE SAFE AND RELIABLE ACCESS TO JUSTICE. ALSO PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET IS- REMOTE LANGUAGE RELATED TO INFRACTION CASES. THAT WOULD ALLOW COURTS TO CONDUCT ALL PROCEEDINGS IN INFRACTION CASES REMOTELY UPON CONSENT OF THE DEFENDANTS. WE HAVE JUDGED ON TERROR DOES TO TELLS THEIR- PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE ALAMEDA SUPERIOR COURT TODAY TO PRESENT TO YOU THE PERSPECTIVE OF THIS THESE PROPOSALS ON CORE OPERATIONS WE ALSO HAVE ROBERT ROBERT- YOUNG. ARE CHIEF OPERATIONS OFFICER FROM THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. TO RESPOND ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU OKAY. TOMORROW MORNING AND THANK YOU ALL FOR HAVING ME I AM JUDGE TARA DAYS ARE TELLING THE PRESIDING JUDGE OF ALAMEDA COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT I AM ALSO THE VICE CHAIR OF THE TRIAL COURT JUDGES ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA AND I'M HERE TODAY TO SPEAK TO YOU IN SUPPORT OF THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD AUTHORIZE REMOTE APPEARANCES AND ALL CIVIL PROCEEDINGS TO THE EXTENT PRACTICABLE AND WOULD ALSO AUTHORIZE REMOTE APPEARANCES IN INFRACTIONS WHERE THERE IS THE CONSENT. OF DEFENDANT. NOW IT WAS OVER A YEAR AGO OF COURSE IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY WHERE OUR COURT LIKE EVERYONE ELSE IN THE STATE WAS FORCED TO DRAMATICALLY SHUT DOWN. IN THE FACE OF THE CORONA VIRUS PANDEMIC. WE STRUGGLED TO FIGURE OUT HOW WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE THEN EXISTING LAWS WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO POTENTIALLY. RE OPEN AND RESUME SOMETHING CLOSE TO NORMAL COURT OPERATIONS. HOW WE WERE ULTIMATELY ABLE TO DO THAT. WAS THROUGH ABOUT APPEARANCES. IT WAS IN APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY THAT THE CHIEF JUSTICE AND THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA ENACTED EMERGENCY ROLE NUMBER THREE. GIVING LOCAL COURTS LIKE OURS THE AUTHORITY TO MANDATE REMOTE APPEARANCES IN DIFFERENT CASE TYPES. WE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THAT AUTHORITY IN ALAMEDA COUNTY AND WE ORDERED REMOTE APPEARANCES IN ALL NON CRIMINAL CASE TYPES AND WE AUTHORIZED REMOTE APPEARANCES IN CRIMINAL CASE TYPES WITH THE CONSENT OF THE DEFENDANT. AS THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL HAD SUGGESTED. THE RESULT WAS A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS. IT WAS THE ONLY WAY THAT WE WERE ABLE TO RE OPEN A MIX SHELTER IN PLACE- NEXT PANDEMIC SERVICES AND MAINTAIN COURT OPERATIONS THROUGH OUT. THIS TUMULTUOUS TIME PERIOD. NOT ONLY WAS IT A SUCCESS BUT IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT WE HAD ISSUED AN EMERGENCY LOCAL WILL INITIALLY. THIS PAST YEAR OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS WE STARTED TO PUBLIC COMMENT PERIODS IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER A NON EMERGENCY RULE PROMOTING REMOTE APPEARANCES WOULD BE APPROPRIATE AND AFTER RESOUNDING WORDS IN SUPPORT OF SUCH ROLE WE ENACTED OUR OWN NON EMERGENCY RULE PROMOTING REMOTE APPEARANCES IN ALAMEDA COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT IT BECAME EFFECTIVE. THIS PAST FEBRUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. NOW WHAT WE LEARN FROM THESE REMOTE APPEARANCES SOME OF THE RESULTS WE EXPECTED SOMEWHERE UNEXPECTED. THE HUGE BENEFIT IS ACCESS TO OUR COURTS REMOTE APPEARANCES PROVIDED TIMELY CONVENIENT COURT ACCESS TO LITIGANTS WITHOUT THE NEED TO TRAVEL TO A COURTHOUSE ACROSS TOWN. ROSS THE COUNTY WITHOUT THE NEED TO TRANSFER ON BUSES OR BARTER DIFFERENT FORMS OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION WITHOUT THE NEED TO TAKE TIME OFF OF WORK OR SECURE CHILD CARE OR DEPENDENT CARE WHICH IS EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT DURING THESE CHALLENGING TIMES THAT WE HAVE BEEN FACING. IN ADDITION. IT ENABLED ATTORNEYS TO APPEAR IN MULTIPLE CASES IN MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS UP AND DOWN THE STATE WITH REDUCED COSTS TO THEIR CLIENT BECAUSE THEY TOO DID NOT HAVE TO TRAVEL TO DIFFERENT COURT LOCATIONS AND DID NOT HAVE TO WAIT. IN COURT ROOMS UNTIL THEIR CASES WERE READY TO BE CALL. BUT THERE WERE ALSO ON THE INTENDED CONSEQUENCES. WHAT WE DISCOVERED WAS IN HIGH CONFLICT AREAS IN PARTICULAR AREAS LIKE FAMILY LAW AND RESTRAINING ORDERS REMOTE APPEARANCES ACTUALLY REDUCED THE CONFLICT LEVEL IT REDUCED THE LEVEL OF TENSION. BECAUSE PEOPLE WEREN'T AFRAID OF COMING INTO COURT PHYSICALLY AND SITTING ACROSS CAN'T BE AND AN AGGRESSOR RENDON SALAS. NOW THERE'S BEEN SOME SUGGESTION THAT REMOTE APPEARANCES CREATE OPPORTUNITIES TO PERSUADE OR INFLUENCE WITNESSES ON APPROPRIATELY. UNFORTUNATELY THE REALITY OF COURT LIFE IS THESE OPPORTUNITIES ALWAYS EXIST NOW AS JUDGES WE ARE TRAINED TO INVESTIGATE YOUR WEEKEND TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR CORPORATE SEEDINGS ARE FAIR AND SECURE FROM THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. BUT WE CAN'T SEE WHO'S DRIVING A WITNESS TO COURT ON ANY GIVEN DAY WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S AN INFLUENTIAL PARTY WAITING FOR THEM OUTSIDE OR OTHERWISE PRESENTING ANY KIND OF THREAT DIRECTOR REPLIED. IN FACT REMOTE APPEARANCES IN CONTRAST WITH TELEPHONIC APPEARANCES WHICH HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS PROVIDE A GREATER OPPORTUNITY FOR COURTS TO SEE IF THERE IS AN INAPPROPRIATE EFFORT TO INFLUENCE A WITNESS. IN REALITY THESE REMOTE APPEARANCES HAVE GIVEN US TRUER TESTIMONY OR AT LEAST AS TRUE TESTIMONY. AND BOTH THE JUDGES THE ATTORNEYS THE PARTIES AND HE LITIGANTS HAVE CORRESPONDINGLY BENEFIT. IN ADDITION IN PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE AREAS THINGS LIKE JUVENILE CASE TYPES OR COLLABORATIVE COURTS WE'VE DISCOVERED THAT REMOTE APPEARANCES AGAIN IMPROVED THE COR INTERACTION. THEY ENABLE THESE MINOR CHILDREN THEY ENABLE THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE GOING THROUGH THE TREATMENT PROCESS TO MAINTAIN THEIR HOME OR WORK OR TREATMENT SETTINGS SO THAT THEY CAN KEEP UP AND ON INTERRUPTED CONTINUUM OF CARE. IN ADDITION FOR MANY WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDERS OR POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS COMING TO COURT ITSELF CAN BE A TRIGGERING EXPERIENCE THAT CAN SET BACK. IN THEIR RECOVERY EFFORTS REMOTE APPEARANCES REMOVED THAT TRIGGERING EXPERIENCE BECAUSE IT BRINGS THE COURT TO THE INDIVIDUAL. WE ARE ABLE TO MEET INDIVIDUALS WHERE THEY ARE IN WAYS THAT WE WERE NEVER ABLE TO DO BEFORE. AND FINALLY ONE ADDITIONAL HUGELY IMPORTANT AREA. IS OUR JURORS WILL LOVE IT. WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REACH MORE JURORS IN MORE AREAS OF THE COUNTY BECAUSE THEY TOO DON'T HAVE THEIR LIVES TO SUBSTANTIALLY INTERRUPTED AS THEY TRAVEL TO COURT REQUIRES THEM TO DO. THEY WILLINGLY AND ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN THESE REMOTE JURY TRIALS AND IN FACT TALK VERY FAVORABLY ABOUT THE PRESENTATION OF EVIDENCE WHERE EVERYBODY'S ON THE SAME PLAYING FIELD ASSUMING A BASE TECHNOLOGICAL PLATFORM. AND HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO VIEW THE WITNESSES AND THE EVIDENCE IN THE SAME WAY SOMETHING THAT THE LAY OUT OF OUR OLD PHYSICAL COURTROOM SIMPLY DON'T AFFORD. NOW WE ALL KNOW THE COURTS THE LEGAL SYSTEM OVERALL IN THE COURTS IN PARTICULAR CAN BE SLOW TO IMPLEMENT CHANGE AND THE CORONA VIRUS PANDEMIC FORCED THIS IMPLEMENTATION AT A MUCH MORE RAPID RATE. THAN ANY OF US WOULD HAVE ANTICIPATED. BUT THE RESULTS AS I SAY HAVE BEEN TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL. AND OUR PEOPLE THE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY HAVE CONSISTENTLY ASKED PLEASE KEEP THESE REMOTE OPPORTUNITIES OPEN. BECAUSE OF THE EXPANDED ACCESS TO JUSTICE THAT IT AFFORDS. NOW THERE'S SOME SUGGESTION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT A PILOT MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE OR SOME KIND OF LOS. IN OUR POSITION. THIS PAST YEAR HAS BEEN OUR PILOT. AND ANY KIND OF PAUSE WOULD UNFORTUNATELY NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE LITIGANTS AND THE MEMBERS OF OUR PUBLIC WHO WE ARE VERY MUCH TRYING TO SEARCH YOUR SERVICE IS ESSENTIAL TO IN THESE VERY DIFFICULT TIMES. AND SO IT'S FOR THESE REASONS THAT WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND LEGISLATION THAT WOULD FURTHER PROMOTE REPORT HE WON THE APPEARANCES AND CONTINUE TO EXPAND THE ACCESS TO OUR COMMUNITY THAT THESE SERVICES PROVIDE. NOW I THINK WE HELP ALSO BROUGHT. WITH US TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON THIS PAST YEAR. GOOD MORNING I'M I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE I THINK THE JUDGE DOES THAT TELL FOR. ARM HER BACKGROUND BUT I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE REGARDING THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. OKAY. WITH YES ARE THE L. A- DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS. ANNUALLY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- SO IN LOOKING AT THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE- WE DID THINK THAT BEAT WE DID FIND THAT THE EXPANSION OF REMOTE PROCEEDINGS DOESN'T MERIT LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS RELATED TO INCREASING EQUITY AND ACCESS TO THE COURTS REDUCING LITIGATION COSTS THAT USERS ARE GOING TO WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY. AND HELPING TO PROCESS CASES MORE COST EFFECTIVELY HOWEVER- WE DID NOTE THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD WANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER REMOTE PROCEEDINGS WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR USE IN ALL CASE TYPES OR PROCEEDINGS. OR WHETHER STATE LAW SHOULD INCLUDE CERTAIN MINIMUM STANDARDS TO ENSURE THAT USERS ACROSS THE STATE ARE. HAVING SIMILAR EXPERIENCES. IN ADDITION I WE FOR THAT PROPOSAL LINE LACKS SPECIFIC AND USED TO SIGNIFY EMPLOYEE. DETAILS TO THE JUDICIAL. AND SO OF THOSE KEEP ARE OUT ON HUGE. OF YOUR AGENDA. REMOTE PROCEEDINGS OF FOR EXAMPLE WOULD IT BE REQUIRED OR NOT. ANOTHER QUESTION IS HOW WOULD COURT PROCESS THESE CHANGE SO WHAT WOULD BE THE RULES FOR PROVIDING NOTICE IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO IF YOU'RE REMOTELY WHAT WOULD BE THE RULES FOR REMOTE DURING TRIALS SIX CETERA. AND THE THIRD QUESTION LAID OUT THERE IS WOOD FAIRNESS EQUITY PRIVACY AND PUBLIC ACCESS ISSUES BE ADDRESSED AND IN WHAT MANNER SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW WOULD INDIVIDUALS BE ABLE TO CHOOSE. HER SENTENCE OR WHAT WITH THAT PROCESS LOOKS LIKE. IN TURN BECAUSE THERE IS THIS LACK OF IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS IT ALSO MEANS THAT THE IMPACTS ON TRIAL COURT OPERATIONS PROCESSES AND COSTS ARE CURRENTLY UNKNOWN BUT COULD BE SIGNIFICANT. AND SO THE UNKNOWN IMPACTS INCLUDE HOW MUCH ADDITIONAL ONE TIME OR ONGOING TECHNOLOGY RELATED COSTS WOULD BE NEEDED. WHAT THE NET IMPACT ON CORE OPERATIONS COST AND WORKLOAD WOULD BE. THE NET IMPACT ON CIVIL RELATED COURT REVENUES THAT CURRENTLY SUPPORT TRUCK OR OPERATIONS. AS WELL AS THE IMPACT ON. FACILITY ONLINE AND WHY OF THE WE HAVE RECORD. OUR FIRST RECOMMENDATION AS WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE DIRECTS THE JUDICIAL BRANCH TO SUBMIT A DETAILED PLAN FOR HOW REMOTE PROCEEDINGS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED BY CASE AND OR PROCEEDING TYPE. THIS TYPE OF PLAN WHICH WOULD ADDRESS THOSE KEY IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS THAT I BROUGHT UP WOULD HELP THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINE WHETHER AND. HOW TO MODIFY THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE TO ENSURE THAT THE OF HER CHRISSY WERE FOR WHAT PRIOR. SUCH AS ON STANDARD. OR A USE IN CERTAIN CASE TYPE OR- AND PUTTING THAT IN STATE. THE SECOND RECOMMENDATION IS IF THE- WHY TO MOVE FORWARD. FOR ANY PLAN IS RISK. UNDER THAT'S WE WOULD RUN THAT THE LET. PILOT REMOTE PROCEED FOR TWO YEARS. AND THE LAST. CASE TYPES PROCEEDING SO FOR EXAMPLE INFRACTIONS ARE SMALL PLANES AND REQUIRE AN EVALUATION BY NOVEMBER FIRST TWO TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND SO THE PILOT AND THE EVALUATION WITH THEN INFORM LEGISLATIVE DECISIONS ON WHETHER TO EXTEND EXPAND OR MODIFY THE AUTHORIZATION ONCE THE PILOT ENDS. AND SO THIS TYPE OF APPROACH WOULD ALLOW FOR IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES TO BE IDENTIFIED AND RESOLVED IN AREAS THAT HAVE LESS IMPACT ON COURTNEY'S OUR LIVES BEFORE BEING EXPANDED TO MORE COMPLEX CASE TYPES. AND PROCEEDINGS AS-A MORE MEASURED APPROACH WOULD HELP MINIMIZE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. AND COSTS. THE FINAL COMMENT THAT WE WOULD PROVIDE IS THAT WE ARE AWARE. THAT THERE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE JUDICIAL BRANCH OF LEGISLATIVE STAFF ON THE LANGUAGE OVER THE PAST COUPLE MONTHS SINCE LANGUAGE HAS BEEN INTRODUCED. AND SO DEPENDING ON LEGISLATORS GOALS THERE ARE CERTAINLY OTHER OPTIONS THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED AS WELL SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THE LEGISLATURE IS CONCERNED THAT- THE AUTHORIZATION WHICH IS AUTHORIZED UNDER THE PANDEMIC EMERGENCY ROLE WOULD GO AWAY TOO SOON AND MORE TIME IS NEEDED. THE LEGISLATURE CERTAINLY COULD ENACT A STATUTE TO TEMPORARILY EXTEND. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS IF THE LEGISLATURE THINGS THAT MORE TIME IS NEEDED TO DISCUSS THE INS AND OUTS DETAILS OF THIS LANGUAGE LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO DELAY ACTING ON THIS LANGUAGE UNTIL MAYBE A LITTLE BIT LATER INTO THE SUMMER. AND SO WE WOULD WHAT WHICH COMPUTER COMMENTS TO SAY YOU KNOW WE'LL BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE ANY ASSISTANCE- AS A LEGISLATURE CONTINUES. TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DEPARTMENT FINANCE DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS. YOUR MIND FINANCE NOT JUST IN GENERAL THE GOAL WITH THE LANGUAGES FROM PROMOTE MODERNIZATION WITHIN CORE OPERATIONS AND FLEXIBILITY FOR COURT USERS BY ALLOWING TRAVELERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE USE OF REMOTE TECHNOLOGY ROLLED OUT DURING THE PANDEMIC. WE VIEW THIS LANGUAGE IS A STARTING POINT YOU WILL NEED TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO POTENTIALLY. REFINERY WHICH THANK YOU. OKAY OF. ALL RIGHT- QUESTIONS HERE MEMBERS YES CENTER COURTESY. THE THINK MINIATURE OF. I CAN SAY I HAVE A QUESTION KIND OF FRAMED AND IN MY OWN COMMENTARY AND- I SUPPOSE IN A PERHAPS PRESIDING JUDGE MIGHT BE THE BEST PERSON TO RESPOND TO THEM- OR OR SOMEONE FROM THAT SIDE. OF BUT ANYWAY LET ME JUST SAY THIS FIRST OF ALL- I WAS. AS THE SOMEONE WHO- CAME HERE AFTER OF BEING A COUNTY SUPERVISOR FOR A DOZEN YEARS SANTA CLARA COUNTY WHAT I'D ACTUALLY DONE WHAT WE CALL REFERRAL AT ONE TIME TO. EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF. THE VIDEO ARRAIGNMENTS- AND REALLY JUST LIMITING FIVE TO THAT AREA- MOSTLY BECAUSE THE COST ESTIMATES IN TERMS OF MOVING PEOPLE BACK AND FORTH JUST FOR AGREEMENTS WHICH THOSE OF US WHO PRACTICE NO IS BASICALLY- YOU KNOW. MOST OF THE TIME NOT ALL THE TIME BUT FEEL GUILTY NOT GUILTY- YOU KNOW OR NO CONTEST- ON THE ON THE CRIMINAL SIDE. WAS ABOUT A FORTY MILLION DOLLAR PRICE TAG PER YEAR- IN IN THE IDEA OF COURSE WASN'T NECESSARY TO TAKE THAT OUT OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM BUT TO REINVESTED- IF YOU KNOW IN. IN AREAS THAT. WERE DEFICIENT- WHICH COULD BE ANYTHING FROM COST OF DOING BUSINESS PERSONAL- A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING I MEAN WHATEVER OR JUST- YOU KNOW KEEPING THINGS AFLOAT IN GENERAL- WE NEVER COMPLETED THAT PROCESS BUT I. REMAIN VERY INTERESTED IN IT OF COURSE. AND I'M HERE IN THE STATE SENATE SO I'M I'M NOT A VOTING. NUMBER DOWN THERE ANYMORE ANYWAY BUT I'M I'M INTRIGUED BY WHAT ALL ME TO COUNTY IS DONE. BUT I JUST WANTED TO AGAIN MAKE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS. I DON'T WANT TO LISTEN TO THE L. A. O. IT STRIKES ME THAT WHETHER YOU'RE ON THE CIVIL SIDE OF THE CRIMINAL SIDE- THE. THE COMPLEXITY SHOULD NOT BE LOOKED AT IN TERMS OF COMPLEXITY OF THE CASE BUT THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PROCEEDINGS FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN HAVE AN EXTRAORDINARILY COMPLEX CRIMINAL CASE WITH THE ARRAIGNMENT IS IT IS GENERALLY AGAIN GENERALLY- IN EXTREMELY- NON COMPLEX A PROCEEDING- WHETHER THE CASES WHETHER THE UNDERLYING CRIMINAL CASES IS. A COMPLEX OR NOT YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S ALL ON THE SIDE- OR MISDEMEANOR FELONY OR MISDEMEANOR SO- ON THE CIVIL SIDE SIMILARLY- AS SOMEBODY WHO PRACTICED ON ON THAT SIDE FOR. SEVERAL YEARS- AND I'LL JUST I'VE NEVER SAID THIS IN PUBLIC BUT I BOTH I ALWAYS CONSIDERED THE CASE MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE PROCESS TO BE A SORT OF AN OBNOXIOUS- OFTENTIMES- PROCESS THAT FELT LIKE. A WASTE OF TOO MANY PEOPLE'S TIME TO GO DOWN TO THE COURTHOUSE SUPPOSING ON CIVIL MATTERS TO GO DOWN THE COURTHOUSE. YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY SIT DOWN FOR A COUPLE TWO OR THREE HOURS WAITING YOUR TRN TO PRESENT. OFTENTIMES FOR UNDER A MINUTE- VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE JUDGES TO HAVE THAT PROCESS SO PLEASE DON'T TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY- THOSE THOSE ON THE JUDICIAL SIDE. BUT NOT SO IMPORTANT FOR SOMEBODY BE SITTING IN THE BACK ROW FOR TWO HOURS BUILDING THEIR CLIENT WAITING OR AN OPPORTUNITY TO STAND UP AND SAY- WERE TRYING TO REACH A SETTLEMENT WE NEED ANOTHER TWO WEEKS. I MEAN THAT CAN EASILY BE DONE. REMOTELY HERE AND MUCH LIKE THE FOLKS THAT COME IN AND OUT OF OUR HEARINGS NOW UNDER REMOTE PROCESS. YOU CAN SORT OF TIME THEIR APPEARANCE FOR WHERE THEY ARE ON THE DOCKET- WHICH I THINK YOU KNOW. WHAT WOULD SAVE CLIENTS MONEY GOOD GOOD GOVERNMENT GOOD PUBLIC POLICY. SO I SAID I WOULD ASK A QUESTION IN THAT CONTEXT AND THE QUESTION IS. YOU KNOW USER IS THERE MAY BE. SOME SORT OF MIDDLE GROUND HERE WHERE YOU KNOW COUNTIES THAT HAVE DEVELOPED THE CAPACITY LIKE ALAMEDA AND THEY'RE ALREADY SORT OF ROLLING ALONG HAVING A GREAT EXPERIENCE WITH A MORE EXPENSIVE VERSION OF REMOTE COURT PROCEEDINGS- PERHAPS ARE ALLOWED TO GO FORWARD THROUGH ONE OF THESE MECHANISMS EVEN IF THE SYSTEM EXTENSION OF- THAT OF THE CURRENT. AUTHORITY BUT IT FOR COUNTIES THAT HAVEN'T YOU KNOW GOTTEN OUT FOR HE HAD. MAYBE WE SHOULD BE LOOKING THAT- SIMILAR TO THE L. A. O. SAID BUT A LITTLE DIFFERENT- GETTING INTO NON. I DO NON COMPLEX PROCEEDINGS- WETHERBY ONE MOTION OR CASE MANAGEMENT CONFERENCES THOSE KIND OF IN AND OUT PROCEEDINGS. THAT ARE CURRENTLY TAKING UP A LOT OF CAPACITY IN TIME FROM AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE OF SO THAT'S SORT OF MY PREFERENCE I AM A LITTLE LEERY ABOUT. YOU KNOW IN FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES TO SWOOPING IN AND SAYING- EVERYBODY- HERE IT IS PERHAPS SENDING THE MESSAGE EVEN IF IT'S NOT IN THE STATUTE ITSELF BUT SENDING THE MESSAGE THAT- WE WANT YOU TO GO GO FAST NO MATTER WHAT YOU FEEL YOUR CURRENT CAPACITY IS. ALL THE WAY INTO THE TRIAL STAGE IN ON THE CIVIL CASES- I WOULD RESPECT SOME DEGREE OF JUDICIAL CONTROL AND LOCAL CONTROL SO TO SPEAK- BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT I COMFORTABLE YET JUST SORT OF OPENING THAT UP KIND OF OPENING THE FLOODGATE- I DO THINK THAT. ON THE ON THE LESS COMPLEX. I MEAN ON THE MORE COMPLEX- CDNS THERE'S CONCERN BUT IF YOU JUST LIMIT TO. INFRACTIONS IN EVERY COUNTY OR A SMALL CLAIMS I THINK THE PROBLEM THERE IS THAT THERE'S SUCH A SMALL SUB SET OF THE BAR IN THE BENCH THAT ARE INVOLVED WITH THOSE CASES. THAT THAT THE 90% OF THE ATTORNEYS WHO WERE DOING- WHO ARE DOING CIVIL LITIGATION MISDEMEANORS FELONIES AND SO FORTH WILL NEVER GET EXPOSED BECAUSE THEY DON'T SHOW UP IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT THEY DON'T SHOW UP- YOU KNOW IT IN SOME OF THE PREVENT. FOR INFRACTIONS YOU KNOW IN MANY COUNTIES OF COURSE THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF AN INFRACTION THE SAID YOU KNOW PEOPLE IN POVERTY AND OTHERS DON'T REALLY HAVE TO LOOK. HE KNOWS. NECESSARILY EVEN SEEK OUT COUNCIL SO I DO THINK IF WE'RE GOING TO RUN EITHER PILOTS OR SOME LIMITED. AUTHORITY HERE IT SHOULD BE IN THESE AREAS WHERE. A MAJORITY OF THE LITIGATORS- OR OR OR PROSECUTORS AND DEFENSE ATTORNEYS SORT OF HAVE TO SHOW UP ANYWAY TO GET TO GET THE EXPOSURE. OF AN TO WORK THINGS OUT AND- YOU KNOW SORT OF RUN THESE PILOTS AND REPORT BACK AS TO HOW THEY WORK HOPEFULLY EVERYBODY COMES BACK AND HAS THE SAME EXPERIENCE OF. HIS ALAMEDA BUT I DON'T KNOW. THAT WOULD BE THE CASE AND IF ANYONE WANTS TO RESPOND TO THAT YOU KNOW THAT MY QUESTION IS ESSENTIALLY IS DOES THAT SOUND. REASONABLE WHEN YOU START LOOKING AT THE STATEWIDE CONTACTS IN. AGAIN I DON'T KNOW IF THE JUDGE- WOULD BE WILLING TO RESPOND TO THAT IF NOT THAT'S FINE. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO RESPOND AND I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. AGREE WITH THEM COMPLETELY AND I THINK YOUR OBSERVATIONS ARE BOTH A STUDENT VERY CONSISTENT. WITH WHAT OUR CORE USERS HAVE EXPERIENCED WHILE WE'VE BEEN IN A REMOTE OPERATIONS AFTER HAVING BEEN IN PERSON. IN TERMS OF CRIMINAL ARRAIGNMENTS WE ACTUALLY FIRST SET UP A REMOTE VIDEO ARRAIGNMENT COURT. IN THE LATE NINETIES SERU HARD LINE NOW THAT WAS DISCONTINUED OVERTIME IN AROUND TWENTY TEN. AND WAS NOT REACTIVATED UNTIL WE RECONNECTED THOSE HARD LINES THIS YEAR WITH THE CORONA VIRUS PANDEMIC. AND WE DID EXACTLY FOR THE REASON THAT YOU STATED. IT WAS SIMPLY UNSAFE TO TRANSPORT INMATES FORTY FIVE MINUTES TO AN HOUR AND A HALF ACROSS COUNTY. FOR A THIRTY SECOND ARRAIGNMENT WHEN THEY COULD APPEAR FROM THE JAIL REMOTELY AND IN FACT HAVE GREATER ACCESS TO OUR RESOURCES MUCH MORE EFFICIENT ACCESS THEN AND THERE. SIMILARLY ON THE CIVIL SCENARIOS IT AVOIDS EXACTLY WHAT YOU TALK ABOUT. THE LONG DELAYED WAIT FOR A VERY SHORT COURT APPEARANCE. IN TERMS OF. HOW THIS WOULD MANAGE ON A STATEWIDE LEVEL THERE'S A HUGE DISTINCTION IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE TRAILER BILL THAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE NOT ALL COURTS ARE SIMILARLY SITUATED AND OF COURSE IN ORDER TO MAKE REMOTE TECHNOLOGY WORK YOU NEED TO HAVE THE BEST TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE. WE IN ALAMEDA COUNTY WERE FORTUNATE IN THAT WERE A RELATIVELY URBAN ENVIRONMENT DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE IN THE COUNTY AND WE HAVE FAIRLY CONSISTENT WIFI AND INTERNET ACCESS. FOR ALMOST EVERYBODY WHO USES OUR COURTS AND WE PROVIDE ALTERNATIVES FOR THOSE THAT NEED ALTERNATIVES. RURAL AREAS MAYBE DIFFERENTLY SITUATED. AND WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE EMERGENCY RULES AS EMERGENCY ROLE THREE AUTHORIZED. EACH LOCAL SUPERIOR COURT TO CREATE ITS OWN LOCAL EMERGENCY RULES BASED ON THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. IN ALAMEDA COUNTY WE MAY PROMOTE APPEARANCES AS I SAID MANDATORY IN THOSE NON CRIMINAL CASE TYPES BECAUSE IT WAS THE ONLY WAY WE COULD OPEN IT WAS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN SERVE THE PUBLIC AND WE BELIEVED WE HAD A PLATFORM AND THE ALTERNATIVES. AVAILABLE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. NOT EVERYBODY IS SIMILARLY SITUATED OR IS ABLE TO DO THAT. THAT'S WHY THE TRAILER LANGUAGE THAT WE HAVE HERE IS PERMISSIVE. SO IT WOULD GIVE THE COURTS THAT FLEXIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT ONLY THOSE THAT WERE READY TO PROCEED. CAN CHRISSY. NOW I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT ANSWERED ALL OF YOUR QUESTIONS BUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER. OR FOLLOW UP IN AN AREA THAT I MIGHT HAVE MISSED- I JUST APPRECIATE THE I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR EITHER AFFIRMATION OR- REJECTION OF SOME OF THOSE THOUGHTS AND IT SOUNDS LIKE GENERALLY SPEAKING- IT LEAST- FROM THE JUDGE'S PERSPECTIVE- MY THOUGHTS ARE ON TRACK BUT THAT'S- THAT'S ALL EFFORT. I DON'T WANT TO. OVER EXTEND THE HEARING- IN IN MADAM CHAIR I CERTAINLY- YOU KNOW DEFERRED TO YOUR LEADERSHIP AND- WHATEVER THOUGHTS RISK COMMITTEE HAS. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR. THE NEWMAN THANK YOU MEASURE SO IT APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION SO FAR MY QUESTION KIND OF BILLS ON THAT IS SPECIFICALLY AROUND A JURY TRIALS DONE REMOTELY YEAH AND MY UNDERSTANDING DID INTO MY CORRECTED THIS IS PART OF THE PILOT MIGHT ACTUALLY- INCLUDE DURING DOING AT LEAST CIVIL. JURY TRIALS ARE MELISSA CORRECT. WELL I THINK. I SHOULD HAVE SOMEBODY I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT I'M ON THE RIGHT- WHAT TE LANGUAGE AUTHORIZES IS IT GIVES THE FLEXIBILITY. FOR INDIVIDUAL COURTS TO AUTHORIZE REMOTE APPEARANCES IN DIFFERENT CASE TYPES AND IN DIFFERENT PROCEEDINGS BASED ON THE NEEDS OF EACH COURT. TO THAT THAT WOULD AT LEAST THEORETICALLY AND INCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY OF FUTURE PARTICIPATION MOMENT CIGARETTE CORRECT AND IN ALAMEDA COUNTY WE HAVE BEEN OPERATING OUR CIVIL JURY TRIALS REMOTELY FROM START TO FINISH. INCLUDING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR JURORS TO COME IN FOR THAT FIRST APPEARANCE INSTEAD OF PHYSICALLY AT THE COURTHOUSE. THEY CAN APPEAR FROM THEIR HOME LOCATION THEIR OFFICE WHEREVER IS MORE CONVENIENT FOR THEM. SO IT MADE IT REALLY IS INTERESTING SO WE'VE ALL HAD KIND OF ASSUME. THE CRASH COURSE IN LIVING BECAUSE HIM. AND SOMETHING'S TO CENTER CORTESE'S POINT WORK EMILY WELL. USING NO TECHNOLOGY IN OTHER THINGS- YOU MIGHT ARGUE ARE ARE INTRINSICALLY DIFFERENT AND WHEN ONE OF THOSE THINGS MIGHT BE JURY TRIALS RIGHT WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF. NONVERBAL COMMUNICATION WHERE PHYSICAL PROXIMITY IS PROBABLY. AT LEAST TRADITIONALLY BEEN PART OF THE EXPERIENCE IN THE BASIS THAT I THINK FOR BOTH SIDES. WHAT'S THE STANDARD. MOVING FORWARD WHETHER YOU KNOW WE CAN ARRIVE AT CONSENSUS WHETHER IT KIND OF WORKS OR DOESN'T WORK. THE. ACROSS DIFFERENT KOREJE. AND ANYBODY ELSE ANY SO THIS IS. AGAIN THIS IS ROBERT A YOUNG FROM THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. I'D ALSO LIKE TO. RESPOND SENATOR CORTE- QUESTION- AND I'M ACTUALLY GLAD THAT YOU BROUGHT UP THE- EXAMPLE OF THE- SANTA CLARA ARRANGEMENTS BECAUSE WHEN THAT ACTIVITY WAS HAPPENING I WAS ACTUALLY THE CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER AT THE SANTA CLARA COURT BY LOOKING AT HELPING TO IMPLEMENT. VIDEO ARRAIGNMENTS- AT SANTA CLARA AND I WAS ALSO VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THAT WAS I'M NOT ABLE TO BE IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE WE SAW THAT THERE WOULD BE A HUGE BENEFIT AND IN DOING THAT. I'M IN TERMS OF THE READINESS OF THE COURTS AND- THE L. A. O.'S- SUGGESTION AROUND A PILOT AND THIS DISCUSSION AS WELL. AROUND THE A PILOT- IN FACT WE ALREADY HAVE FIFTY FOUR COURTS TO HAVE REMOTE PRECEDING CAPABILITY IN AT LEAST ONE CASE TYPE ARE WE HAVE ACTUALLY THIRTY EIGHT COURTS MORE THAN HALF OF THE COURT- HAVE REMOTE CAPABILITIES IN ALL CASE TYPES AND SO. WE THE EXAMPLE THAT CHURCH STATES THAT TELLS- HAS. VERY ELOQUENTLY- DESCRIBED IN ALAMEDA IS A SITUATION IN MANY OF OUR COURTS RIGHT NOW- AND SO WE ARE PROVIDING SERVICE. TO THE PUBLIC IN THIS MANNER- AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH INTERESTED PARTIES AND GETTING THEIR FEEDBACK ARE REGARDING WHAT'S WORKING WHAT'S NOT WORKING IN ORDER FOR US TO ENHANCE OUR PROCESSES TO IMPROVE THAT OVERALL SERVICE. I AM THE SUGGESTIONS THAT THE L. A. O. HAS MAKE A REGARDING. THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN QUESTIONS THAT SHE HOMBRES THOSE ARE ACTUALLY ALL QUESTIONS THAT WOULD BE ANSWERED THROUGH OUR STANDARD RULES MAKING PROCESS SO THROUGH THE RULES OF COURT- ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT THE L. A. L. HAS RAISED- WE WOULD GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS- WHICH WOULD INCLUDE OUR- COMMITTEES. AS WELL AS EXTENSIVE PUBLIC COMMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE- PROVIDING BALANCED. RULES THAT ADDRESS ALL THE NEEDS OF THE POOR. BUT IN- YOU KNOW FORM- BOTTOM FIRST. MAKING THAT WE'RE PROVIDING TO JUSTICE IN A VERY SAFE AND EFFICIENT MANNER. ANYMORE QUESTIONS CENTER NEW NO OKAY- THEY HAVE THE HANDLE OKAY BELIAU PLEASE CONSUME. I'M ANNUALLY WITH THE L. A. S. SO- A COUPLE OF PIECES OF TIME BACK TO SENATOR NEWMAN QUESTIONS SO THE FIRST ISSUE IS FROM THE COURTS IN VERY QUICKLY DURING THE PANDEMIC AND I AND I AND I WON IT WAS LIKE THEY DID LOTS OF THINGS WERE EMPLOYED. AND I THINK THE CHALLENGE ON THAT ONE IS DIFFERENT COURTS ARE DOING THINGS IN IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND THERE IS NOT A GREAT ASSESSMENT OF WHAT THOSE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES R. AS WELL AS SORT OF A- OF HOW THINGS ARE GOING I THINK THAT'S KIND OF ONE. PIECE THAT I WOULD LAY OUT FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND SO PART OF THE CONCEPT IN TERMS OF THE PLAN OR OR EVEN A PILOT SO UNDER RECOGNITION OF PILOT IT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT COULD BE TESTED AND EVALUATED ON A MORE ROBUST BASIS TO THEN INFORM DECISIONS MOVING FORWARD. THE SECOND ISSUE IS- YOU KNOW MISTER- AND MENTIONED THAT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH IS PLANNING ON DEVELOPING RULES OF CORE IN FLUSHING OUT SOME OF THOSE KEY IMPLEMENTATION QUESTIONS I THINK IT'S CERTAINLY TRUE THAT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH WILL HAVE QUESTIONS AS SORRY IT WILL HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT AND VERY THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATIONS OUR CONCERN IS BASICALLY THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THEIR ROLE. WOULD LIKELY WANT TO HAVE IN PLACE ON SOME OF THOSE KEY IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS AND SO IT IS A POLICY DECISION FOR EXAMPLE ON WHETHER OR NOT THERE SHOULD BE CERTAIN MINIMUM STANDARDS TO ENSURE THAT THE DIFFERENCES FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY ARE NOT TOO EXTREME- AND SO THAT COULD FOR EXAMPLE INCLUDE JUST MINIMUM STANDARDS RELATED TO TECHNOLOGY MINIMUM STANDARDS RELATED TO RULES N TERMS OF WHAT PROCEEDINGS THAT IS APPROPRIATE AND ARE NOT APPROPRIATE. FOR EXAMPLE SO I THINK THAT THOSE ARE JUST A COUPLE OF COMMENTS WE WANTED. TO ADD SO THANK YOU. BUT SO THANK MY WRITER. THANK YOU- I AM- A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS BEFORE MY COM. A THE EMERGING ROOM. AND THE TIME MEAN AROUND THE RAY OF THE EMERGENCY RULE MAYBE. OF WHOEVER THE L. A. O. OR THE JUDICIAL BRANCH- COULD EXPLAIN THAT BECAUSE WHAT WE DO HAVE A RULE IN PLACE. AS AN EMERGENCY RULE FOR A CERTAIN LENGTH OF TIME- THAT HAS ALLOWED ENOUGH FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC ON OUR COMMUNITIES- SO IF SOMEONE COULD ANSWER THAT QUESTION. YES SO THIS IS- ROBERT A YOUNG FROM JUDICIAL COUNCIL SO THE EMERGENCY RULE RIGHT NOW- IS REMAINING WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT. UNTIL NINETY DAYS AFTER THE GOVERNOR DECLARES. THAT THE STATE OF EMERGENCY RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC IS LIFTED. OR AND CHILLED THE RULES IS AMENDED OR REPEALED BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL- AND THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT. ARE THE PROBLEM A STATE OF EMERGENCY SHOULD NOT BE CONFUSED WITH THE ELIMINATION OF THE TIER SYSTEM THAT'S COMING UP ON JUNE FIFTEENTH. OKAY SO THERE IS NO CURRENT DATE FOR THE OBVIOUSLY FOR THE MERGES C. TO BE LIFTED. AND IT WOULD BE NINETY DAYS AFTER THAT. CORRECT SO. IT WOULD BE UNFAIR TO SAY THAT WE HAVE AT LEAST. SIX MONTHS NINE MONTHS TWELVE MONTHS. IS THAT A. IS IT UNFAIR TO COME UP WITH A ROUGH DATE AS TO WHEN THIS COULD BE A MERGING ZERO COULD BE LIFTED. I WOULD BE VERY VERY HESITANT TO GUESS AS TO WHEN THE GOVERNOR WOULD DECLARE THAT THE STATE OF EMERGENCY WOULD BE LIFTED YEAH YEP YOU'RE RIGHT- WELL I AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE. OBVIOUSLY WE WERE ALL. SORT OF WRITING THE NEW RULES AS WE WENT ALONG. LIKE NOBODY SAID OKAY FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN I KNOW WHAT THE IMPACT IT'S GOING TO BE SO LET'S DO IT THIS WAY. AND I BET IT WAS AT TIMES ON A DAILY BASIS AT TIMES ON A WEEKLY BASIS. BUT THERE WAS THIS CONSTANT HOW DO WE DO THIS WE'RE DOING THIS GOOD THIS IS NOT WORKING- AND THAT'S WHAT SORT OF- MAKES ME HESITATE. THAT THE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN DONE UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES VERSUS THINKING ABOUT HIM ON A PERMANENT BASIS. AND THE DELIBERATE INVOLVEMENT AND INTEGRATION OF A LOT OF STAKEHOLDERS- THE EMPLOYEES WHO WORK IN THOSE COURTS. THE PEOPLE WHO USE THE COURT SERVICES- WHAT IS A WE'RE STILL DEALING WITH THIS WHEN IT COMES TO EVERYTHING ELSE IN OUR LIVES IS ACCESS TO CONNECTIVITY. ACCESS TO THE DEVICES- AND I THINK THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT CERTAINLY COME UP BETWEEN RURAL AND URBAN AREAS BUT EVEN WITHIN URBAN AREAS- IT'S NOT LIKE ACCESS AND CONNECTIVITY IS SO PERFECT NOW. SO I HAVE SOME REAL CONCERNS ABOUT USING THE EXPERIENCE. THAT WE WENT THROUGH AS THE EXCLUSIVE WAY TO DECIDE WHAT WE SHOULD DO MOVING FORWARD PERMANENTLY AND ALSO ENCOMPASSING. THE WAY THAT IS BEING- PROPOSED HERE- YOU KNOW THERE'S ISSUES OF PUBLIC SAFETY THE PRIVACY OF THE INDIVIDUALS- YOU KNOW IF SOMEBODY'S BEEN DECIDE OKAY TOLD YOU COULD DO IT FROM HOME. WHAT KIND OF PRIVACY DO YOU HAVE IF YOU'RE DOING IT FROM HOME- SO- AND THAT COULD LEAD TO THE SAFETY ISSUES- SO I HAVE A SOME REAL CONCERNS I DO THINK THAT. IT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT A COMPLETELY REVAMPING. THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. NOT THE LAWS THAT GOVERN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM BUT HOW PEOPLE RELATE TO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. THE THEIR OWN PERSPECTIVE ON HAVING ACCESS TO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM I THINK ALL OF THAT WE'RE BEING ASKED AS THE LEGISLATURE. TO COMPLETELY REVAMP EVERYTHING. AND WITHOUT HAVING HAD I THINK THE THOROUGH CONVERSATION OF WHAT THAT MEANS WELL WITH THE KIND OF A PLAN THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO DO THAT- THERE'S IT'S LIKE. YOU KNOW REMOTE LEARNING WHAT WE FIND OUT ABOUT THAT- WHAT WORKED AND WHAT DIDN'T HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE I MEAN WE'RE STILL WORKING THAT IT BESIDES MAKING A PERMANENT DECISION SO. IDEA I WOULD- I PERSONALLY. THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION A PLAN SO THAT WE COULD DISCUSS OF THE LEGISLATURE. IS IS THE BEST WAY TO GO INCORPORATING THE EXPERIENCES UP UNTIL NOW- I THINK THERE'S JUST FAR TOO MANY ISSUES THAT HAVEN'T BEEN EXPLAINED AND PUT FORWARD- AND I'M YOU KNOW COUNTY NON. EMPLOYEES WHO MAKE THIS WORK I GOT A LOT OF COMMENTS ABOUT ALL THE ISSUES THAT COME UP FROM. MORE REPORTERS- AND- THEIR INABILITY TO DISTINGUISH WHEN THERE'S A CAMERA MICROPHONE DEPENDING ON WHERE IT'S PLACED WE'VE HEARD FROM INTERPRETERS WILL FIND HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO HEAR- SOMETIMES LAWYERS TALKING OVER THEMSELVES I MEAN THEY'RE ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN THE REAL WORLD DAY TO DAY. THAT I THINK NEED TO BE REALLY- ARE MUCH MORE THOUGHTFUL BUT WE DECIDE ON HAVING A PERMANENT AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS A PERMANENT AS- THAT'S BEEN PROPOSED- CENTER GROVE ANY. AUSTIN'S ARE COMMENTS MADAM CHAIR I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY APOLOGIZE FOR BEING LATE I'M KIND OF BOUNCING AROUND TODAY AND COMMITTEES OF I THINK THAT WE LEARNED A LOT FROM COLLUDED- THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE LEARNED THAT WERE VERY POSITIVE AND SOME TINGS THAT WERE VERY NEGATIVE THE IMPACT ON OUR CHILDREN FOR INSTANCE WAS NEGATIVE- BUT- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU TAKE. M. VINO VIRTUAL VISIT VIRTUAL VISITS FROM DOCTORS- TO BE ABLE TO ASSESS SOME SOME SITUATIONS WITH THEIR PATIENTS IT. SEES THE PATIENTS FROM TRAVELLING AND BACK AND FORTH AND I THINK THAT APPLIES HERE TO THE COURT SYSTEM. NGUYEN WE CAN USE A VIRTUAL APPEARANCES AND DO SOME VIRTUAL CHANGES AND LEARN WHAT WORKED WELL IN THE COURT SYSTEM FOR COATED. AND APPLY THOSE PROCESSES MOVING FORWARD I THINK IT'S A COST SAVING MEASURE. IT'S A SECURITY MEASURE THAT HELPS YOU'RE NOT TRANSPORTING AN INDIVIDUAL INMATES FROM. THE SYSTEM INTO THE COURTHOUSE- THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE LEARNED FROM CO BUT THAT WOULD BE GOOD- IF IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE WE WERE FORCED TO IMPLEMENT THEM UNDER THE COVER NINETEEN RESPONSE THAT THE GOVERNOR HAD- SO I DO THINK THAT IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD DEFINITELY LOOK AT WE SHOULD DEFINITELY- IMPLEMENT WHAT WAS GOOD. THATWE LEARN FROM THIS COVERED SITUATION AND THEN NOT IMPLEMENT WORKED IS- YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE TRADITIONALLY SOMETHING BAD. THANK YOU FOR A MAKE A COMMENT. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT- SOMEONE ELSE WANTS TO SPEAK OKAY. YOUR OF IS THAT YOU DON'T START I WAS LOOKING UP AT THE LIBERTY THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE NOT USED TO FIFTH POINT FOR THIS GOOD POINT OKAY YES CENTER FOR DISEASE- THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU. COM I THINK IT THERE IS- SPOKE HUMAN CENTER NEWMAN INDICATED WE'VE HAD OUR OWN LEGISLATIVE EXPERIENCE WITH. A LOT OF THINGS GOING RIGHT AND THEN SOME THINGS. AND I THINK INTERPRETERS HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE EXAMPLES IT'S HARD FOR. HER TO STEP IN AND SORT THAT OUT SOMETIMES WHEN IT'S REMOTES WILL BE INTERESTING TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT ON SINCE WORD THE BUDGET. COMMITTEE BASICALLY- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WOULD BE. OF INTEREST TO ME GOING FORWARD IN TERMS OF A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION IS WITH THESE THIRTY EIGHT COURTS THAT HAVE GONE. ALL THE WAY SO TO SPEAK IN IN IN EVEN THE FIFTY FOUR. WHO ARE. NOT NECESSARILY- ALL THE WAY- IF THAT WAS THE RIGHT NUMBER BUT THE- THE QUESTION IS. HOW THE- HOW WOULD OF THE DONE WITH THE SAVINGS- IN IT IN AB I FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT THE COURT SYSTEM HAS HAD. IT'S CHALLENGES ALMOST ACROSS THE BOARD IN TERMS OF- BUDGET THEIR OWN BUDGET IMPACT RATE- IS THERE NEED FOR RESOURCES SO I DON'T SUGGESTS. THAT THERE THERE IS A PLENTY OF NEED I JUST DON'T KNOW GIVEN ALL THE NEEDS. YOU KNOW HOW SOME OF THOSE COUNTIES- COURT SYSTEMS MADE THE DECISION OR WHETHER THAT WAS MADE YOU KNOW FOR ME SOMEHOW AT THE STATE LEVEL. I DON'T NEED AN ANSWER NOW. I JUST THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR US AND YOU TALKED ABOUT- WHAT HAPPENS IN TERMS OF- WORKFORCE TRANSITION FOR EXAMPLE- IN I THINK. AS WE ALL KNOW FOR THE MONEY RIGHT IF THAT WAS ADDRESSED WITH SOME OF THE COST SAVINGS TO REDEPLOY PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR. US TO KNOW THAT- BEFORE YOU KNOW ANY KIND OF- TRAILER BILL OR AUTHORIZATION GOES OUT THERE SO IT'S THIS IS REALLY JUST A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION IF YOU'RE WILLING TO. ENDORSE THAT- APPS- COMMITTEE STAFF CAN ASSIST WITH THAT THANK YOU ABSOLUTELY YES WE WILL. WE WILL SEE TO FIGURE THAT OUT AND GATHER THAT INFORMATION THANKS OKAY IF THERE ARE NO MORE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SOMEBODY ELSE HAD THEIR HAND. YES THIS IS ROBERT A YOUNG PHARMACISTS COUNCIL GO AHEAD. YOU ARE SO I DID WANT TO ADDRESS A COUPLE OF THE QUESTIONS FROM BOTH- THAT YOU HAD MENTIONED SENATOR DRAWS AS WELL AS A SENATOR. CORTESE REGARDING- COST SAVINGS ACCOUNT AT THIS POINT WE HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED ANY COST SAVINGS ARE RELATED TO REMOTE HEARINGS- IN IN FACT BY THE COURTS REALLY HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING AS YOU HAVE MENTIONED. AS A RESULT OF. THE 10% BUDGET CUTS OUT LAST YEAR. AND THE FUNDING- THAT THEY CURRENTLY HAVE. THAT'S WHY WE REALLY ARE PUTTING A LOT OF SUPPORT TOWARDS THE GOVERNOR'S EXISTING- BUDGET PROPOSAL AS AMENDED- WITH RESTORATION OF THAT BUDGET AS WELL AS- ADDITIONAL SEVENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR ONGOING SUPPORT. FOR OPERATIONS- IN TERMS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION AT EACH OF THE COURTS ARE REALLY IT WAS A PRACTICAL WAY IMPLEMENTING REMOTE PROCEEDINGS WITH A PRACTICAL WAY TO CONTINUE TO. KEEP PROVIDING ACCESS TO JUSTICE TO THEIR CITIZENS AND SO- YOU KNOW THE BIGGEST DRIVER WAS TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT- AND IN FACT LAST YEAR WE DID RECEIVE. A FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AS PART OF THE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE BUDGET FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER TWO YEARS- AS PART OF OUR MODERNIZATION FUNDING AND SO WE THE COURTS WERE ABLE TO UTILIZE THAT MONEY. IN ORDER TO DEPLOY- VIDEO SYSTEMS ARE THROUGHOUT THE COURTS AND SO. THAT IS A LIMITED AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT- DOES- IS ONLY AVAILABLE FOR TWO YEARS- SO IF THERE ARE GOING TO BE FUTURE BUDGETARY NEEDS HOW WE WILL WORK THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS- TO REQUEST THOSE BUT AT THIS POINT WE'RE NOT REQUESTING ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDS- AND WE'RE NOT SEEING- SAVINGS IN PARTICULAR. ARE REGARDING- PERSONNEL- WE HAVE NOT HAD ANY JOB LOSSES RELATED TO THE MOVEMENT TO REMOTE PROCEEDINGS AND IN FACT WHAT WE HAVE SEEN AS WE'VE SEEN. NEW JOB OPPORTUNITIES ARISE AS WE ADDED THESE NEW SERVICES SO FOR EXAMPLE- HAS VIDEO COORDINATORS ARE NEEDED- WE NEED PEOPLE. NOW TO PROVIDE A TECHNICAL- SUPPORT TO THE- AT YOU'RE USING MORE AND MORE TECH. AND SO WE SEE THERE'S A MORE. FOR PEOPLE AND FOR STAFF AS WE DEPLOY ON THESE NEW SERVICES. AND THEN GOING BACK TO SENATOR DRAWS THOSE QUESTION AROUND- A LITTLE BIT OF HESITANCY. RELATED TO- DRAWING FROM THE EXPERIENCE FROM THE PANDEMIC FOR A LONG TERM DEPLOYMENT- WE FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT HOWEVER I VIDEO REMOTE HEARINGS HAS BEEN ON OUR ROAD MAP. AND ON OUR STRATEGIC PLAN NOW FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND SO WE HAVE ACTUALLY HAD- MANY BEST PRACTICES WE ACTUALLY HAVE A VIDEO REMOTE INTERPRETING GUIDE- THAT HAS SOME GUIDELINES AND RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING. VIDEO REMOTE INTERPRETING- WE HAVE PUBLISHED ARE A PANDEMIC CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS- RESOURCE GUIDE WHICH INCLUDES SECTIONS ON REMOTE HEARINGS. AND SO WE HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN PLANNING AND LOOKING AT OUR INCLUDING THIS SERVICE AS PART OF THE STANDARD OFFERINGS ARE FROM THE COURTS. FOR MANY YEARS AND SO THE PANDEMIC WAS ACTUALLY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO ACCELERATE THE EXISTING PLAN- THAT THAT WE ALREADY HAD AND TO PROVE OUT SOME OF THE CONCEPTS- AND SOME OF THE PROCESSES THAT. WE HAD IN PLACE ARE YOU ALSO MENTIONED SOME CONCERNS AROUND- PRIVACY THINGS LIKE THAT- THOSE TYPES OF ISSUES ACTUALLY ALREADY OCCURRENCE JUDGE THEY SETTLE HAD ENTIONED. IN OUR IN PERSON- PROCEEDINGS AND SO WE DO HAVE AN EXISTING TRAININGS REGARDING. DECORUM OUR PRIVACY- CONFIDENTIALITY THROUGH OUR WITKIN'S COLLEGE- THAT BE OUR JUDGES MUST ATTEND AND SO WE CONTINUALLY INVOLVED THAT- CURRICULUM AND THE TRAINING RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO OUR JUDICIAL OFFICERS. AS WELL AS TO STAFF TO ENHANCE- THE COURT OUR EXPERIENCE AND TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS- PRIVACY- AND- OTHER- CONSIDERATIONS. ARE TAKEN INTO PORT. THANK VERY MUCH STERN. ANYONE ELSE. NO MEMBERS REAL GOOD OKAY THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE ALL THE INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDED FOR US TODAY. R. NOW WE MOVE ON TO ISSUE TWENTY TWO OUR RECIDIVISM REDUCTION STRATEGIES THROUGH OUR COLLABORATIVE COURTS. I THINK WE HAVE JUDGE BLOODY ANNALS. WE DO THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND- THANK SUB COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE IN- BE IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY- I AM THE CHAIR OF THE COLLABORATIVE JUSTICE ADVISORY COMMITTEE COPTERS AS COURTS OF ARCHERY COMMITTEE TO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL I ALSO HAVE THE HONOR AND PRIVILEGE OF BEING A JUDICIAL OUTREACH LIAISON FOR THE- AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION FOR REGION REGION NINE. AND THIS IS A TOPIC THAT IS REALLY EXCITING TO ME JUST BECAUSE OF THE MOVEMENT IT WHERE WE ARE WITH COLOR WITH COLLABORATIVE COURTS- SO ONE THING WE REALIZE WHAT AMERICA SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND CLUBCORP STARTED AROUND SUBSTANCE ABUSE- AS A DRIVER OF MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT BRING PEOPLE THROUGH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. I MEAN WE'RE STARTING TO LEARN THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER ISSUES BEYOND SUBSTANCE ABUSE OR MENTAL HEALTH IS ANOTHER ISSUE THAT'S COME UP THAT IS HUGE IN DRIVES THE BEHAVIOR THAT BRINGS PEOPLE IN INTO OUR SYSTEM HOMELESSNESS IS HUGE ON THAT ISSUE COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL ISSUES ARE ARE HUGE ON THAT ISSUE. SO WE'RE STARTING TO REALIZE IT AS AS A GROUP THAT THAT THERE ARE ALL OF THESE ISSUES OUT THERE THAT WE CAN THAT WE CAN DEAL WITH- OUR CLUB RECORDS WORK BUT CUTS ON USERS OF THE COURT SUPERVISION SUPERVISION AS PART OF PROBATION COMMUNITY SUPERVISION OR PAROLE TO DO AFFECTED THINGS WITH INDIVIDUALS SO WE CAN DO DIAGNOSTICS SO IS INDIVIDUALS COME THROUGH THE SYSTEM WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLE DIAGNOSTIC TOOL SCREENING TOOLS AND ASSESSMENT TOOLS. TO BE ABLE TO DIAGNOSE WHAT THOSE INJURIES ARE AND WE CAN ACTUALLY TAKE THOSE INJURIES AND MOVE FORWARD WITH THEM WITH REFERRALS AND THEN YOU COMBINE THAT. WITH THE USE OF ACCOUNTABILITY ON ON THE END AS PART OF SUPERVISION- AND THAT KIND OF STE CARRENTALS TYPE OF AUTHORITY TO THE JUDGE HOUSE IN THAT SUPERVISION MODE- TO ACTUALLY EFFECTIVELY CHANGE BEHAVIOR. I WILL TO REFER TO IT AS WELL WE'RE DOING WHEN I'M- WHEN I'M IN THERE THAT CORE. IS E. R. DIAGNOSE THIS ISN'T. ROOM AND WE'RE DOING E. ARE DYING. DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS INDIVIDUALS APPEAR BACK IN FRONT OF ME MULTIPLE TIMES OVER ARE THERE BECAUSE OF SOME INJURIES THAT ARE IN THERE SO IF WE WANT TO BE EFFECTIVE AND HAVE THEM. HELP ME SUCCESSFUL MEMBERS AND NOT COULD NOT COME BACK IN FRONT OF THE COURTS WE NEED TO DO THAT- THAT SCREEN ASSESS REFERRAL TRIAGE- I KNOW A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE TAKE A LOOK AT THAT CLUB OF COURTS IN THE SEA IN THIS KIND OF. BOUGIE COURTS WORK BUT WE'RE JUST FOR A SMALL NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS IN MAY BE HAND PICKED FOR CHERRY PICKED INDIVIDUALS OR SOME SOME OF THE- CONCERNS WE GET SOME SOMETIMES FOR LACK OF A BETTER PHRASE. BUT THE NEW MODEL WHAT WE'RE WORKING WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS IT IS EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE IN IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF DOING THAT- WE'RE GOING TO NOT JUST SUBSTANCE ABUSE BUT WARNING WE HAVE CLUB OF COURSE DEALING WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. YOU KNOW WHAT HOMELESSNESS ISSUES DEAL WITH VETERANS ISSUES DONALD PTSD- SO WE ARE MUCH BIGGER THAN THAT VISION. WAS AYE AND THERE ARE SOME MODELS LIKE OUR MODEL THERE ARE NO EXCLUSIONS WE DON'T EXCLUDE PEOPLE FROM COLLAPSING COLLABORATIVE COURSE THERE IN THERE. ARE JOB AS PART OF THAT SUPERVISION TOOL IS TO DO THOSE DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS AND WORK IN THE END BE AFFECTED- SO FOR INSTANCE IN IN IN MY COURT- WE DO A DIY COURT HERE IN SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY. IN WE HAVE FIVE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS GO THROUGH MY DO YOU Y. COURT- IN SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT- SO MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS SINCE TWO THOUSAND OR NAY. WE WERE ABLE TO DOCUMENT THE RECIDIVISM REDUCTION WE WILL DOCUMENT A REDUCTIONS IN IN COLLISIONS- AND SO IT'S THAT SCENARIO WHERE EVERYBODY EVERYBODY WINS SAFETY WISE BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING AFFECTED BEHAVIOR CHANGE- SO WE TRY TO TAKE THE YEAH. WHICH WAS GLOBAL WITH NO. AGAIN THIS DIED- ASSIST TO EVERY- AND WE IT IN THE ENTIRE CRIMINAL JUSTICE. SO WE DESIGN A SYSTEM. AROUND THE PROGRAM. PAROLE COMMUNITY SUPERVISION REVOCATIONS- TO DO THAT SCREENING ASESSMENT FOR EVERYBODY WHO HAS HAD MORE THAN MORE THAN ONE COME THROUGH WE'RE GOING TO DO THE DIAGNOSTIC THING ON THAT. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN MORE OR SIX ACTS WHEN WE FIRST STARTED IT- OUR P. R. C. S. VIOLATIONS THAT ARE FILED BY PROBATIONER DOWN MORE THAN SEVENTY PERCENT- WITH NO FEWER BEING SENT TO US. SO THAT SAME THING ON THE DIY SIDE WE WENT FROM THIRTY THREE HUNDRED FILINGS DOWN ELEVEN HUNDRED FILINGS IN IN TEN YEARS. ON THE REVOCATION CALENDAR WE'RE GONE WE'VE GONE LITERALLY A 70% REDUCTION IN THAT CALENDAR AS WELL JUST BY USING THESE DIAGNOSTIC. TOOL SO WHAT MAKES THE CLIMATE OF COURSE WORK. IS THE DAY YOU OF THAT THAT POSITION OF THE COURTESAN AT SUPERVISION POSITION WHETHER IT'S PROBATION COMMUNITY SUPERVISION OR PAROLE. THEY USE THAT POSITION TO THEM BRING BILLS EFFECTIVE TOOLS IN AND ACTUALLY DO WHAT EVIDENCE BASED ON THE DATA TELLS US- BUT WE NEED TO DO IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF WORKING WITH AND- ALSO THE OTHER TWO THINGS THAT I THINK. REALLY MAKE THE MODEL WORK- IS THE FACT THAT IT IS THE USE OF DATA EVERYTHING WE DO IS DRIVEN EVIDENCE BASED ON EVERYTHING WE DO IS BASED ON RESEARCH. WE EVALUATE OURSELVES WE- WILL LEARN OURS OURSELVES AND WE ADJUST BASED ON OUR EVALUATIONS AND OUR NUMBERS. WHICH ISSUE WHICH IS HUGE- AND MOST OF THE A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING THROUGH OUR ARE HOMELESS SO WE'RE LEVERAGING- THE COMMUNITY RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO HELP INDIVIDUALS WITH FACT. I WAS JUST TOLD THIS MORNING THAT OUR MAYORS COMING IN TO WATCH MY MENTAL HEALTH COURT ON TUESDAY MORNING. AS PART OF HIS APPROACH ON ON HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE COMING THROUGH ARE GOING. TO BE THE INDIVIDUALS THAT NEED THOSE RESOURCES AND STOP SO IT'S ONE- THE ONE THING THAT I THINK. A COURT DO- ON THAT SUPER BY SIDE BRING EVERYBODY DID YOU TAKE. AND GET EVERYBODY TO WORK TO IN THE INTEGRATED FASHION WHICH IS REALLY THE KEY. THE KEY IS JUST EVERYTHING WORKING TOGETHER IN AN IN A SYSTEMIC IN INTEGRATED WAY THAT MAKES US MORE MORE EFFECTIVE SO THE STUDIES ARE OUT THERE. IN TERMS OF THAT COST EFFECTIVENESS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ONE OR DO YOU AYE COURT COMING OUT IN ABOUT A MONTH. IN TERMS OF THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS BUT WITH THE RECIDIVISM REDUCTION TO COMES THROUGH AND I MEAN YOU CAN TELL JUST BY THE NUMBERS IN IN MY COURT BUT I WAS ABLE TO GIVE YOU ON HOW WE WERE ABLE TO REDUCE THE WHY FILES HOW RATE WILL BE REDUCED- PARIS YES REPLICATE. REVOCATIONS THIS CHANGE IN BEHAVIOR IS WHAT IS A WAY TO REALLY DO IT I CALLED THE COMMUNITY SUPERVISION COURT- BECAUSE IF ONCE AN INDIVIDUAL'S BEEN SENSOR ON SUPERVISION IF YOU HAVE THIS. THIS PART OF THE COURT. WHICH DESIGNED TO EFFECTIVELY USE THAT SUPERVISION- TO GET PEOPLE GET RESOURCES TO PEOPLE GET THEM CONNECTED TO KEEP THEM FROM COMING BACK INTO THE SYSTEM. IT'S THE EVERYBODY WINS SCENARIO. SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S FUN AND I'M I'M REALLY EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT IT I THINK WE'RE KIND OF ON THIS. TRAJECTORY RIGHT NOW ARE MORE WE'RE LOOKING AT REALLY DOING THINGS IN A MUCH BIGGER WAY. I'M TRY AGAIN I THANK YOU I THANK THE CHAIR ON THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO YOU AND THEN I'LL BE HAPPY. TO ENTERTAIN ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU JUDGE OF. ON I JUST A COUPLE OF QUICK. AS IT IS. BUDGET COMMITTEE- WHAT IS HOW DOES THIS- ALL. HOW DO HOW DO YOU GET THE FUNDS FOR THE COLLABORATIVE COURTS COULD YOU EXPLAIN THE WHOLE FUNDING PROCESS AND I CAN ALSO- IF YOU WERE TO EXPAND SINCE YOU'RE- UP THE BIG ADVOCATE FOR IT WHAT WOULD WHAT KIND OF INVESTMENT WOULD YOU BE LOOKING AT. OR WOULD YOU. BOB PROPOSE. I THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION IS EXCELLENT ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS IN THE COURT'S GOING TO SCALE AND TO BE ABLE TO USE THIS IS THEIR HOUSE BUT THERE'S NO STABLE FUND FUNDING SOURCE SO THERE WAS THE ORIGINAL DRUG COURT DOLLARS- BIG BIG BIG CAME DOWN OF COURSE OF COURSE REFUSING TO GROW UP OR DOLLARS WHEN THEY FIRST CAME DOWN- BUT THAT GOT RE ALIGNED IN TWENTY ELEVEN TWENTY TWELVE SOMEWHERE AROUND THERE WENT TO COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND QUITE FRANKLY A LOT OF COURTS DON'T EVEN SEE THAT SO GOT ROUTED THROUGH. COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND I HAVE TO DEAL WITH COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WANTED TO USE- THE MONEY FOR US FOR OTHER STUFF ALL ALL THE TIME SO IT WILL REALLY LOST A LOT OF BELIEVE WITH THAT MONEY- WEIT WAS REPLACED WITH FIRST INNOVATIONS AND THEN RECIDIVISM REDUCTION INNOVATION WAS ABOUT I WAS ABOUT TEN TEN MILLION FOR COLLABORATIVE COURTS OVER COUPLE YEARS RECIDIVISM REDUCTION NINE POINT NINE SOMETHING LIKE THAT ON THOSE GOT REPLACED BUT THOSE ARE THOSE WERE TEMPORARY PILOT FUNDING. AND THE PROBLEM THAT YOU HAVE WHEN YOU WANT TO TRY TO GET A COURT- TO GO TO SCALE AND REALLY USE THESE PRINCIPLES IS IT'S HARD TO GET PEOPLE TO BUY INTO THAT WE AND OUR FUNDING SOURCES GOING TO GO AWAY SO WHAT HAPPENS IS WE HOW WE DEAL WITH A LOT OF COURTS AND I ACTUALLY WAS REALLY TO BENEFIT SURE OF IT BECAUSE WE USED A LOT OF MONEY TO THE OTHER COURTS AT OTHER COURTS WERE USING IN THE PROGRAM BECAUSE THEY DON'T SEE THAT STABILITY THAT LONG TERM- SHORT. SO THE ABILITY TO HAVE THAT STABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING WOULD LET COURTS TAKE THIS CONCEPT IN USE THIS SUPREME COURT CONCEPT TO DEAL WITH THE WORKLOAD MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY IN TERMS OF THE NUMBERS- STAFF IS DONE A LOT OF TIME AND ALSO OF OTHER COURTS- IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY'RE WHAT THEY'RE WHAT WHAT THEY'D DONE IN OTHER STATES IN A LOT OF OTHER STATES HAVE FUNDED ON THE RANGE WE GET MY GLASSES. ARE HERE FOR A SECOND SO I CAN GET THERE- YOU KNOW. HOW OTHER STATES. IT WILL. THE RECOUNT POPULAR. THE ESTARá WOULD BE TO SIX MILLION TO SIXTY FOUR MILLIONS I AM THINK JUSTIN INVESTMENT OF WERE THIRTY MILLION- PER YEAR WHAT I'M PROBABLY REALLY EFFECTIVE STATEWIDE IN TERMS OF GETTING COURTS TO STEP FORWARD AND REALLY USING THIS POWER THAT QUITE FRANKLY WE'RE NOT USING RIGHT RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE THE TRADITIONAL IS YOU KNOW JUST JAIL IS THE ANSWER TO THAT RESOURCE IS THE TRADITIONAL RESPONSE INSTEAD OF DOING THIS INTEGRATED BEHAVIOR BASED THING WHICH I THINK THE COURTS COULD VERY EFFECTIVELY DO ACT THAT THREE MILLION DOLLAR ANNUALLY A YEAR AFTER YOU GET A LOT BETTER YOU GET A REDUCTION IN JAIL TIME YOU GET A REDUCTION IN CASES COMING THROUGH IT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK WOULD REALLY HELP. SO A QUESTION YOU HAVE A FINAL QUESTION FOR ME. A SHORT ANSWER IS HOW. DO YOU GET FUNDED RIGHT NOW. EIGHT IT'S MOSTLY GRANT PARK THE GRANT FUNDING- SO NOW AND SOME COURTS A LOT OF COURSE HAVE JUDGES WRITING GRADING GRANTS I MEAN THAT'S HOW HOW MUCH LITTLE SUPPORT THERE IS OUT THERE BUT IT'S MOSTLY GRANT FUNDING- BJ SAM SURE WHAT WILL HAVE SOME GRANT FUNDS FOR TREATMENT IN THE JAIL HOUSE OF REPORT OR STRUCTURAL BUT THEY'RE SHORT THEIR LIMIT THERE WILL THERE LIMITED TIME WISE TOO SO THERE'S NOTHING THAT GIVES THE SECURITY WITH THOSE GRANTS. SURE YOU HAVE THOSE GRANTS- RIGHT NOW AT INNOVATIONS JUST ENDED SO WE- INNOVATIONS OUT THERE SO WE DON'T HAVE A HOUSE NO ANYTHING TO DO THERE WHAT KIND OF RELYING ON THAT THE DRUG COURT DOLLARS AND THAT DEPENDS ON HOW GOOD YOUR YOUR FUNDING IS SO I THINK YOU CAN KIND OF SEE WHY EVERYTHING IS SO LIMITED RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THERE IS NO RELIABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING THAT THAT WE CAN GO TO SO FOR US. IT IS WE HAVE SOME OF THE DRUG COURT WE WILL DROP OR DOLLARS TO OUR BEHAVIOR HEALTH BECAUSE WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM WE HAVE BJ GRANTS- WE DON'T HAVE ANY SAM SURE BRANDS WE HAVE INNOVATIONS DOLLARS AND THEN- ARGUE WHY COR IS SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF TRAFFIC SAFETY ON WITH FEDERAL HIGHWAY SAFETY DOLLARS BECAUSE THEY'VE SEEN THE VALUE IN THE REDUCTIONS THAT GO THERE BUT IT'S A VERY. VERY DIFFICULT- PATCHWORK TO PUT TOGETHER AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT PREVENTS A LOT OF COURSE FROM BEING ABLE TO USE THOSE RESOURCES THANK YOU- THE ALLEY- HAVE ANY COMMENTS. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THE L. L. WE HAVE NO COMMENT- THANK YOU. THANK YOU- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SEVENTY COMMENTS. I JUST YOUR MIND DEPARTMENTS FINANCE NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD. OKAY MEMBERS ANY COMMENTS QUESTIONS NO THERE ARE NONE OKAY JUDGE VOLUME AS WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH OFFER WHAT YOU DO OBVIOUSLY THIS LOOKS LIKE IT REALLY- HAS TREMENDOUS BENEFIT FOR OUR COMMUNITY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PRESENTING TODAY. NO THANK YOU. OKAY WE'RE MOVING ON TO ISSUE TWENTY THREE THAT'S ACCESS TO JUSTICE- FOR COURT USERS. WE HAVE FOUR PANELISTS. OUR REPRESENTING VARIOUS SERVICE PROVIDERS- LET'S SEE WE HAVE QUE MAR. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY LEGAL AID SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE SANDRA LEVIN. OUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR LOS ANGELES COUNTY LAW LIBRARY LESLIE. THE WORKSHOP YOUR NAME OF HI MY OF. PERFECT YES. OKAY REPRESENTING CHILDREN'S LAWCENTER CALIFORNIA AND- LEVI SANCHES GOVERNMENT RELATIONS ADVOCATE FROM SEIU CALIFORNIA- THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR BEING WITH US TODAY AND I THINK WE'LL START WITH KATE MARA. GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME- AS YOU SAID MY NAME IS KATE MARTIN I'M APOLOGIZING IN ADVANCE OF YOUR DOGS OR CHILDREN IN THE BACKGROUND- I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AT COMMUNITY LEGAL AID SO HOW. OUR PROGRAM IS PROVIDED FREE LEGAL ASSISTANCE TO ORANGE AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY RESIDENTS SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT I'M ALSO THE CO CHAIR OF THE BOARD THE LEGAL AID ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AN ORGANIZATION THAT IS DEDICATED TO HELPING ENSURE ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR CALIFORNIANS THROUGHOUT THE STATE REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY LEFT. AT MY PROGRAM WE STRIVE TO PROVIDE EQUITABLE COMPASSIONATE AND EFFECTIVE ACCESS TO JUSTICE SYSTEM FOR UNDERSERVED AND UNDER RESOURCED COMMUNITIES. THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR CLIENTS LIVE AT OR BELOW 2100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LIMIT. OUR CLIENTELE IS RACIALLY AND ETHNICALLY DIVERSE AND A QUARTER OF THEM SPEAK A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH AND MOST OF THEM HAVE CHILDREN LIVING IN THEIR HOMES. MANY OF OUR CLIENTS ARE SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR SOME OTHER FORM OF DRAMA. WE HELP CLIENTS WITH FAMILY LAW ISSUES HOUSING IMMIGRATION CONSUMER DATA PUBLIC BENEFITS HEALTH CARE ISSUES AND REMOVING BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT. LIKE CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS. WE HAVE A COMPLEX LITIGATION UNIT THAT ENGAGES IN SYSTEMIC ADVOCACY LIKE OUR LAWSUIT AGAINST THE CITY OF HUNTINGTON BEACH TO UPHOLD STATE PORTABLE HOUSING LAWS AND IN THE LAST FEW YEARS WE'VE ALSO ADDED CASE MANAGERS TO OUR TEAM WORK WITH CLIENTS AND CONNECT THEM TO OTHER RESOURCES OR SUPPORT. THAT THEY MEET. SO AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW THE INTEREST ON LAWYERS TRUST ACCOUNTS. ARE THE BACKBONE OF FUNDING FOR LEGAL AID IN CALIFORNIA. FUNDING THAT IS CRITICAL FOR THE OVER ONE HUNDRED LEGAL AID ORGANIZATIONS LIKE MINE THAT DO THIS WORK. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THIS INTEREST IN THE AGGREGATE WAS FORTY SIX POINT FIVE MILLION. FUNDING THAT WENT TO SUPPORT CRITICAL LEGAL SERVICES FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. AS THE COPING CRISIS HIT AND INTEREST RATES FELL SO DID I ALSO FUNDING. FUNDING WENT FROM FORTY SIX POINT FIVE MILLION IN INTEREST IN. TWENTY NINETEEN TO ONLY TWENTY SIX MILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY THE STATE BAR IS PROJECTING TWENTY TWENTY ONE NUMBERS AT TWENTY FIVE MILLION. SO JUST OER THE PAST TWO YEARS WE LOST A CUMULATIVE FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING AND THOSE ARE GRANTS THAT WE COULD HAVE USED TO MAINTAIN SERVICES DURING THIS CRITICAL TIME. LEGAL AID PROGRAMS LIKE MINE I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR WE WERE UNDER FUNDED TO MEET THE NEEDS PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC. WITH ONLY ONE LAWYER FOR EVERY FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED CALIFORNIANS WE'RE LOOKING AT A DROP OF OVER TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCES DURING THE LAST RECESSION IT WILL TAKE A VERY LONG TIME FOR INTEREST RATES TO RECOVER. WE HAD ONLY JUST RECOVERED A DECADE LATER ON THE IMPACT OF THE LAST INTEREST RATE CRASHED ON THIS CRUCIAL FUNDING FOR LEGAL AID. ANOTHER CRITICAL SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR LEGAL AID THAT PEOPLE ACT EQUAL ACCESS FUND. THE FUND IS AN INVALUABLE RESOURCE AND A FOUNDATIONAL SUPPORT OF THE CALIFORNIA'S LEGAL AID SYSTEM. ALL INCREASES TO THE FUND MAKE AN ENORMOUS IMPACT ON WHAT ORGANIZATIONS LIKE MINE CAN ACCOMPLISH. AS YOU MIGHT GUESS THE PROVISION OF LEGAL AID HINGES ON A DELICATE BALANCE. AT OUR PROGRAM WE STRIVE TO PROVIDE IN DEPTH SERVICES. TO THOSE MOST IN NEED WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY HELPING AS MANY CLIENTS AS POSSIBLE. I ALSO AN EQUAL ACCESS FUNDING BOTH MAKE THIS EFFORT POSSIBLE BY UNDERWRITING A RANGE OF LEGAL SERVICES FROM LEGAL ADVICE TO FULL REPRESENTATION. AND THIS ALLOWS US TO PROVIDE CRITICAL LEGAL SERVICES TO THOUSANDS OF NEIGHBORS ANNUALLY. AT MY PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY WE USE EQUAL ACCESS FUNDING TO UNDERWRITE OUR INTAKE AND ASSESSMENT TEAM WHICH IS THE POINT OF ENTRY FOR PROGRAM FOR ALL OF OUR CLIENTS. THIS TEAM CONDUCTS A COMPREHENSIVE LEGAL SCREENING FOR EACH CLIENT TO IDENTIFY AND TRIAGE THEIR LEGAL ISSUES. I LEGAL ADVICE AND REFERRALS TO THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO CALL OUR HOTLINE OR COMPLETE AN ONLINE AND- THEY ALSO CONDUCTS CLINICS WORKSHOPS AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH. OUR PROGRAM HAS ONE OF THE LARGEST FREE LEGAL HOTLINE IN THE UNITED STATES AND IT'S A CRITICAL TOOL FOR US FOR TWO REASONS. FIRST IT ALLOWS US TO MEET IMMEDIATELY HELP A HIGH NUMBER OF CLIENTS STRUGGLING WITH LEGAL PROBLEMS. MANY OF THE CLIENTS THE CALL US WE'LL HANG UP KNOWING WHAT THEIR NEXT STEPS ARE TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM AND DON'T NEED ANY FURTHER ASSISTANCE. OUR STAFF. TO FOCUS ON PROVIDING FULL SCOPE REPRESENTATION FOR THE MOST COMPLEX CASES. BEYOND FOR CLIENTS WERE IN MOST NEED OF HELP. OUR HOTLINE IS ALSO POISED TO SERVE AS A REGIONAL CALL CENTER IN THE EVENT OF A DISASTER LIKE A WILDFIRE OR AN EARTHQUAKE. ACCORDING TO CENSUS DATA IN MY PROGRAM SERVICE AREA ALONE THERE WERE OVER SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ELIGIBLE FOR OUR SERVICES AND TWENTY TWENTY. THAT'S OVER 15% OF THE POPULATION. WITH OUR LIMITED RESOURCES WE WERE ONLY ABLE TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO JUST OVER NINETEEN THOUSAND. OVER THE PAST YEAR IN RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC OUR PROGRAM WAS ABLE TO SHARE WITH THE HELP OF PEOPLE ACCESS FUNDING TO MEET THE CHANGING NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY ALL WHILE WORKING REMOTELY. WE TRAINED OUR INTAKE AND ASSESSMENT TEAM TO ASSIST WITH UNEMPLOYMENT ISSUES AND ADDED TO OUR HOUSING TEAM TO HELP TENANTS UNDERSTAND THE MANY OVERLAPPING COVERT RELATED HOUSING PROTECTIONS AND REPRESENT THEM IN COURT WHEN THEY'RE LANDLORDS TRIED TO EVICT THEM IN VIOLATION OF THOSE PROTECTIONS. DUE TO THE PANDEMIC CASES ARE INCREASING PRECIPITOUSLY. AT THE END OF APRILTWENTY TWENTY ONE WE HAVE ALREADY CLOSED OVER HALF THE NUMBER OF CASES THAT WE CLOSED IN TWENTY TWENTY. AND WAIT TIMES ON OUR HOTLINE I'VE GROWN TO AS MUCH AS TWO TO THREE HOURS. THESE FACTORS ILLUSTRATE THE SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR HELP IN THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. OUR CLIENTS FACE MANY OF THE SAME PROBLEMS THEY FACED BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. FAMILY CRISES HOUSING INSTABILITY FINANCIAL AND SECURITY. BUT TODAY THEIR SITUATIONS ARE MORE DIRE AND MORE NUMEROUS THAN BEFORE AS MANY GRAPPLE WITH THE FALLOUT UNEMPLOYMENT. ILLNESS AND LOSS OF LOVED ONES. WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR PRESSURE CASES WILL GROW AS COURTS TURNED TO A MAN. BACK OF CIVIL CASE. AND WE CANNOT COME CLOSE TO MEETING THIS GROWING NEED WITHOUT SUFFICIENT FUNDING. SO I WANT TO EMPHASIZE WE'RE NOT REQUESTING MORE OVERALL FUNDING AT THIS TIME BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY HOPING IS TO USE THE EQUAL ACCESS FUND TO BACK FILL THE LOSS OF FUNDING FOR MY ALSO- WE ALONG WITH OUR SISTER LEGAL AID ORGANIZATIONS DEPEND ON THE FUND'S. NOVEL CALIFORNIANS ESPECIALLY WHEN OUR OTHER FUNDING STREAMS DECREASE AS IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW WITH MY OLD. EVEN PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC WE WERE NOT ABLE TO MEET THE NEED. AND THE DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES AND CERTAINLY AT CURRENT FUNDING LET LEVELS WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SERVE THE INCREASING NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN NEED. ESPECIALLY IN THE COPA NINETEEN CONTEXT SO FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE REQUESTING OR ASKING AND URGING YOU. TO ADD A FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO BE EQUAL ACCESS FUND AN ADDITIONAL FIFTY FIVE MILLION. OR- INFRASTRUCTURE AND INNOVATION GRANTS TO BE ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA ACCESS JUSTICE COMMISSION. THANK YOU THANK YOU. SANDER LEVIN. THANK YOU AND I'M GONNA TRAIN SURE MY SCREEN- HERE. OKAY CENTRAL THE PRESS OF THE COUNCIL OF HEALTH COUNTY LAWLER FROM HERE REPRESENT COUNTY LAW LIBRARY FROM A THE AS WELL AS MY OWN ONLINE AND ANGELES. COUNTY LOW LIBRARIES THE MOVE.

WHEN THEY CAN'T AND- ANY SORT OF LEGAL. WE AS YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM LIBRARIES PROVIDE WRITTEN MATERIALS BUT WE ALSO PROVIDE ONLINE ASSISTANCE HELP SELF HELP GUIDES INSTRUCTIONAL HANDOUTS CLASSES WORKSHOPS ONE ON ONE ASSISTANCE. AND WE ALSO PROVIDE REFERRALS TO OTHER AGENCIES LIKE COURT SERVICES LEGAL AID ORGANIZATIONS AND SO ON. BASICALLY WE LISTEN TO PEOPLE WHO ARRIVED TYPICALLY VERY UPSET AND STRESSED APOLO LIBRARY WHO COULDN'T FIND HELP ANYWHERE ELSE AND WE HELP THEM FIND A PATH FORWARD. IN FACT THE IN LOS ANGELES THE MOST COMMON RESPONSE WE RECEIVED FAR OUT OUT TEN QUESTIONNAIRES. IS NOW I HAVE HOPE YEAH THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE HOPE. BECAUSE DON'T ANYWHERE TO TRY WE HOPE WE NO ONE CAN WHEN AGENTS. CAN'T PROVIDE SYSTEM MAYBE THE PATRON DOESN'T. BASED ON MATTER OR IN WE HELL IN EVERY WE NO RISK. ON THE SUBJECT MATTER WORK CAN GET HELP A. COUNTY LAW LIKE. AND A REAL THAT THE BUDGET COMMITTEE HOW REACHED DOZENS DOZENS AND DOZENS OF LETTER. FROM COURTS FROM JUDGES SELF HELP- ORGAN. FROM LATER. FROM VOLUNTEER ATTORNEYS ALL OVER THE STATE THIS YEAR ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR COUNTY LAW LIBRARY. HOW DID GET TO THE SO. WE'RE IN. WELL TONY IS USED TO ABLE TO ENSURE HOW LOLA REVENUE. THE AMOUNT OF FIVE FEES THAT WENT TO COUNTY LAW LIBRARY BUT THAT IN. TWO EIGHT. TIME THE STATE FOR ON FEES FEDERAL. WITH A NEW A NEED SOURCE OF ADDITIONAL. HOW DO YOU LAW LIBRARIES WHEN BE ABLE MEET THERE ARE COSTS THIS WAS BACK IN TWO EIGHT SINCE TIME SHE KNOWS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO FOR THAT STABLES OF A RARE. NO SIMPLE. FUNDING WAS PROVIDE FOR A JACK. AND REVENUE PLUMMETED FOR A JACK. SO YOU LOOK AT THE YELLOW LINE ACROSS THE OF THIS. BACK WHAT OUR REVENUE WITH LOOK LIKE A IT HAD STAY THE SAME AS IT WAS A TWO NINE. THE TOP LINE THIS GREEN UP. LINE WHICH IS WHAT OUR WOULD NAY TO LOOK LIKE IF WANTED TO UP THE CALL OF LEE MATERIALS. BUT OF COURSE WE DIDN'T RECEIVE. THE NEXT ONE DOWN IS ARE READ WILL HAVE HAD TO LOOK TO KEEP UP WITH YOUR THE CALL. OF YEAH. BUT THAT WASN'T WHAT WE- I. WHAT WE- TO THAT RAY LINE. A PLUMMET IN REVENUE FOR A DECADE. IT JUST KEPT GOING. AND. SO BY TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. SOMEHOW LAWLER HAD. OTHERS WERE AT RISK OF CLOSE. AND EVERYONE US HAD ME DRUM. CUTS SO FOR THE FIRST TIME MY HUNDRED TWENTY YEAR HISTORY OF CASH WELL I. HELLO PROVIDE HAD- SIMILAR. CHEN FUND MONEY TO CARRY LAWLER IS TO GOT SICK AND A HALF MEN STATE WHY. IN OUR FISCAL YEAR NINE. WE RECEIVE NO. IN FISCAL YEAR AND WE WERE SEVERAL OLLARS. IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR TWO FILLED FOR- MOSCOW GOOD LOSS FILINGS STUDENT IN IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THAT KEPT MANY OF. BY IT DIDN'T COME. TO SOLVE THE- IN FACT WITH THE PANDA WE SAW EVEN OVER. IN OUR TO THE BLUE BAR IS THE YEAR AND A AND FEBRUARY OF THOUSAND NINE AS A KID. POINT THE READING GREEN BARS THAT YOU SEE THAT ARE A HUGE STEP DOWN ARE WHAT WE- PREPAYMENT AND NINE AND TWENTY YEARS ENDING IN DECEMBER OF. DOES HE- AND THEN YOU CAN SEE WHY HAPPENED IN THE- IN THE PER BAR LOS SIGNIFICAN MORE TO THE- WHERE. THE U. ENDING IN TRAVEL OF TWENTY ONE. WAS ONLY ABOUT PER. OF WHAT COUNTY LAW LIBRARY HAVE REACHED AND FINALLY FEES IN. TWO THOUSAND NINE. AT THE SAME TIME THIS PANDEMIC BECAUSE A HUGE SURGE PUBLIC NEED AS BEEN DESCRIBED BY OF MY COLLEAGUES- THE HEALTH ISSUES DEPEND. OKAY RISE TO A NEW FOR GUARDING AND CONCERN. SADLY MANY MORE. LEADING TO ACCESS TO BUT TO HADN'T. A HUGE SURGE IN DEMAND BY AND I REQUEST TO COUNTY LAW LIBRARY SUITE WE SAW OF THINGS EVERY OTHER ASIAN THAT WERE IN THIS HAS. YEAH CAN HARD OF THE PEN. AS YOU KNOW CALLED BECAUSE CRISES HOW EVICTION. HOW DIVORCE HIM- ED MANY MANY PEOPLE TRYING TO NEW SMALL BUSINESS AND THERE WILL FEW RESTORE FOR THE WE HAVE- THE MOST OFFER IT LONG AS WELL AND AT THE SAME TIME PEOPLE FOR FREE WAIVERS WHICH OF COURSE MEANS LESS OF A HIGHLY REVENUE ALESTRA NETWORK. RATES. SOURCES AND CHALLENGES IN PROVIDING OUR SERVICES SO THERE'S LESS OUT THERE FOR THE PUBLIC TO RELY ON EACH AND THEY'RE MORE DEPENDENT ON THE CATCH ALL OF COUNTY LAW LIBRARY. SO THIS HUGE LOSS OF FUNDING IN COUNTY LIBRARY'S CAUSED US TO HAVE TO REDUCE LOCATIONS REDUCE SERVICE OUT THOSE LOCATIONS WE MAKE CUTS TO OUR COLLECTIONS WHICH REDUCES ACCESS TO. CURRENT ACCURATE INFORMATION FROM THE PUBLIC WE HAD TO REDUCE STAFF WHICH REDUCES HOURS AND WORK MEANS LONGER WAIT TIMES FOR THE PUBLIC. AND MORE LIMITED LANGUAGE ACCESS. WE ARE SUFFERING THROUGH SOME TRAILING FACILITIES AND POOR INFRASTRUCTURE ESPECIALLY AYE SHE NEEDS WHICH THE PUBLIC IS GREATLY DEPENDENT. SO WHERE THAT LEAVES US NOW IS THAT. PEOPLE NEED HELP WITH THEIR LEGAL STRUGGLES NOW MORE THAN EVER THE- THEY NEED IS DRAMATIC AND IT'S ENORMOUS FAR MORE THAN WHAT WE CANCER THEIR FINANCIAL SURVIVAL YOUR EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL WELL BEING THEIR DIGNITY THEIR PHYSICAL HEALTH AND THEIR FAITH IN THEIR JUSTICE SYSTEM DEPENDS ON THE SERVICES AND THE HELP. THAT WE ALL CAN PROVIDE COUNTY LAW LIBRARIES ARE THE SAFETY NET FOR THOSE WHO ARE FACING THESE CHALLENGES WITHOUT AN ATTORNEY WE'RE THE ONLY ONES THAT HAVE NO RESTRICTIONS ON WHO WE SERVE AND WHAT TOPICS WILL COVER AND WE ARE AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT THE STATE FOR EVERYONE. AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE AGAIN ASKING THAT. THE LEGISLATURE HELP US IN PROVIDING A- STABLE ADEQUATE FUNDING SOURCE FOR COUNTY LAW LIBRARY. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF WE MOVE ON WITH LESLIE HI MARK. THE SIDE RIGHT RIGHT MOST AFTERNOON ABOUT FOUR MINUTES AWAY FROM THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY- I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AT CHILDREN'S LAWCENTER OF CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT EVERY CHILD IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM HERE LOS ANGELES COUNTY. SACRAMENTO AND PLASTER WHICH GIVES US THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALMOST HALF THE CHILDREN IN THE STATE IN CALIFORNIA'S CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM I AM ALSO HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF A COALITION OF DEPENDENCY ATTORNEYS REPRESENTING PARENTS AND CHILDREN. AND ALMOST A 100% OF THE STATE- WE ARE OF A GROUP OF ATTORNEYS THAT MEET REGULARLY. TO ADDRESS AREAS OF COMMON CONCERN. WE HAVE A TWO PART. TOM THAT IS BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE TODAY SO I'M GOING TO SPEAK ABOUT THEM SEPARATELY FIRST I'M GOING TO ADDRESS THE THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR I'M GOING REQUEST AND THEN I WILL TALK ABOUT THE TEN MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME FUNDS REQUEST. I WAS ALSO ASKED TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND IN HISTORY SO I'LL START WITH THAT. WHEN TRAVELER FUNDING WENT INTO EFFECT IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR DECIDED THAT THE DEPENDENCY COUNCIL FUNDING WOULD REMAIN WOULD REMAIN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE. AND AT THAT TIME HISTORICAL ALLOCATIONS WERE MAINTAINED AND CONTINUE TO BE MAINTAINED FOR OVER TWO DECADES WHICH RESULTED IN DRAMATIC INEQUITIES AND DISPARITIES ACROSS THE STATE. DEPENDENCY COUNSELING WHY IN SOME COUNTIES. BEING FUNDED AT A MUCH HIGHER PER CLIENT RATE THAN IN OTHERS. BY TWENTY FOURTEEN THIS HAS LED TO A CASELOAD CRISIS WHERE THE AVERAGE CASELOAD AROUND THE STATE WITH THREE HUNDRED CLIENTS PER ATTORNEY AND IN SOME PLACES IT WAS AS HIGH AS. FIVE HUNDRED CLIENTS ATTORNEY. I THAT TIME OUR GOAL IS FOR IN BEGIN TO WORK WITH RELIGIOUS. THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND THE GOVERNOR'S ON STAFF. TO RECTIFY THESE INEQUITIES AND A NEW SYSTEM OF DISTRIBUTION WAS CREATED WHICH INCLUDES AN ANNUAL REALLOCATION TO ENSURE. THAT AS CASELOADS CHANGE FUNDING MATCHES THOSE CASELOADS ACCORDINGLY. THANKS IN PART IN LARGE PART TO THIS COMMITTEE AND YOUR COUNTERPARTS IN IN OTHER PARTS OF OUR- LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT ANGRY PROGRESS RESULT REDUCING CASELOADS AND ENSURING EQUITY ACROSS THE STATE THROUGH THAT ANNUAL RELOCATION PROCESS I MENTIONED. HOWEVER WE ARE STILL SHORT OF THE RECOMMENDED MAXIMUM CASELOAD OF A HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE CLIENTS PER ATTORNEY. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN FEDERAL FUNDING POLICY CHANGE ALLOWING STATES TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL MATCHING DOLLARS AND ACCORDING THE DEPENDENCY COUNCIL THE DEPENDENCY COUNCIL BUDGET WAS INCREASED BASED ON AN EXPECTATION OF FEDERAL MATCHING DOLLARS. ABOUT TWO FORTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE FIRST YEAR AND THEN FIFTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN CURRENT YEARS IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND IN THE BUDGET YEAR. HAD WE BEEN ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THOSE- INCREASES AND ACTUALLY RECEIVE ALL OF THE- PROJECTED FEDERAL FUNDS WE WOULD HAVE FINALLY BEEN IN A POSITION IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE WERE ABLE- TO ENSURE NO MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE CLIENTS HER ATTORNEY AND ALSO. ENSURE ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR OTHER- AUXILIARY EXPENSES AND- BEST PRACTICES UNFORTUNATELY THE ACTUAL CLAIMS IN YOUR ONE AND THE EXPECTED CLAIMS THIS YEAR AND IN THE BUDGET YEAR ARE FAR SHORT. OF WHAT WAS PROJECTED. IN YEAR ONE WE DROVE WE WERE ABLE TO DRIVE DOWN TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS WHICH RESULT WHICH IS 53% OF THE PROJECTION. THIRTY OUT OF FORTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET. THIS YEAR WE EXPECT THAT AT BEST WILL BE ABLE TO DRIVE DOWN 75% OF WHAT WAS PROJECTED AND PERHAPS UP 280% NEXT YEAR. THERE ARE A LOT OF- THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS WHICH I WILL GO INTO AT THIS TIME- THE FEDERAL RULES KEEP CHANGING- UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE BEEN PUT INTO A RETROACTIVE BILLING SITUATION NOW TWO YEARS IN A ROW WE HAVE. RIGHT HERE. AND ALL OF THE FIRST YEAR WAS BUILT RETROACTIVELY AS WELL WE HAD MEAN RECEIVED REMAINING WOULD BE AT THE VARIOUS ATTORNEY GROUPS. ONLY JUST RECEIVED THE RULES FOR CLAIMING FOR THE CURRENT YEAR- A FEW WEEKS AGO AND THEY HAVE THEY HAVE YET TO BE COMPLETELY FINALIZED I WAS ON A PHONE CALL THIS MORNING WHERE CHANGES WERE AGAIN. I'M BEING DISCUSSED AND CLARITY SOUGHT AND CERTAIN FINE POINTS PUT ON THE CLEANING RULES SO WE WILL BE CLAIMING RETROACTIVELY AGAIN THIS YEAR. AND IN SOME SITUATIONS WILL BE LEAVING MONEY ON THE TABLE BECAUSE THE RULES AS I SAID THE RULES HAVE CHANGED. AND THE DOCUMENTATION THAT IS REQUIRED. TO CLAIM FOR CERTAIN ACTIVITIES IS NOT AVAILABLE BECAUSE WE DIDN'T KNOW AND TELL THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS THAT WE NEEDED THAT DOCUMENTATION. YEAH THE CLAIMING AND BILLING IT GOES BACK TO JULY ONE AND WE CAN'T RETROACTIVELY CREATE RECORDS FOR EXAMPLE. TIME RECORDS THAT DON'T EXIST. THESE AND- OF A VERY. IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO- TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS WONDERFUL FEDERAL OPPORTUNITY. THE SECOND OF. AND SO I WILL BE IN LOOKING AT MY ORGANIZATION AS AN EXAMPLE FOR THIS CURRENT YEAR OF THE FIRST HALF OF THE CURRENT YEAR WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR MATCH RATE IS ONLY GONNA BE ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN OUR ABILITY TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE IN CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO TAKE FULL. IS THAT WHEN THE PROGRAM. FIRST STARTED THEY EXPECTED A 59% PENETRATION RATE FOR THREE YEARS WE THEN LATER LEARNED FROM- FROM THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL THAT THAT HAD BEEN ARONIE EASILY COMMUNICATED- THROUGH THE CONTRACTING PROCESS NOT NOT THROUGH ANY FAULT OF JUDICIAL COUNCIL THAT YOU CHANGES- AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AND IT THE PENETRATION RATE IS ACTUALLY IT WAS 59% THE FIRST YEAR 55% THE SECOND CAR A YEAR AND WILL ONLY BE 54% IN THE BUDGET YEAR SO AN AUTOMATIC 5% REDUCTION IN THE EXPECTED MATCH- THAT IS OUT OF EVERYONE'S CONTROL. ADDITIONALLY THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES THAT ARE EITHER MANDATED BY STATE LAW OR DRIVEN BY BEST PRACTICES THAT DO NOT MEET THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR MATCHING AND MANY OF THESE ACTIVITIES- ARE ARE PRACTICES THAT THIS LEGISLATURE. I HAVE- RECOGNIZE AS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO SERVING FAMILIES AND CHILDREN IN THE DEPENDENCY SYSTEM. FOR EXAMPLE SOME OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT PRACTICES AROUND MULTI DISCIPLINARY REPRESENTATION OF CHILDREN WHO'VE BEEN VICTIMS OF COMMERCIAL SEX TRAFFICKING WILL NOT BE MATCH BALL SIMILARLY ARE VERY INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS THAT ARE IN PLACE TO SERVE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE IN FOSTER CARE WHO BEEN ARRESTED THOSE ACTIVITIES WILL NOT BE MATCH OF ALL THE USE OF PARA PARTNERS AND HERE ADVOCATES WHICH IS. A SHINING EXAMPLE OF- BUT A PRACTICE THAT CALIFORNIA HAS LED THE WAY OF HAVING PEOPLE OF LIVED EXPERIENCE WORKING ALONGSIDE LAWYERS TO PROVIDE BETTER SERVICES TO PARENTS AND CHILDREN SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES THEY ENGAGE ON A DAILY BASIS WILL NOT BE MATCH OF ALL. SOME OF OUR TRAINING IS NOT MAGICAL I COULD GO ON THERE'S A BUS UNFORTUNATELY A FAIRLY LONG LIST OF ACTIVITIES THAT ARE NOT MATCH OF ALL TIME TO AN ATTORNEY SPENDS IN A STAFF MEETING IS NOT MAGICAL. SO IT IS BECAUSE BECOME MATHEMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO REACH THE MATCH THE SECOND VERY SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE REBATES BACK TO THE RETROACTIVE BILLING PROBLEMS AND THAT IS BECAUSE THE MATCH ASSUMES THAT THE PRIOR YEAR'S MATCH WILL ALSO BE MATCHED WE HAVE TO SPEND IT TO MATCH IT WE. HAVEN'T RECEIVED THE FUNDING AT SO WE CAN IT SPEND IT SO WE CAN'T MATCH IT. ONCE AGAIN. THE DOMINO EFFECT WHERE IT WILL BE A HOW. TO THE FULL FAT MATCH. IN LAST GET A JUMP START ON THE FEDERAL FUNDING STREAM BY INCREASING THE STATE FUNDING AS RECOMMENDED BY UP TO THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS EACH YEAR UNTIL WE CAN REALIZE A GREATER SHARE. OF THE AVAILABLE FEDERAL FUNDING. I'LL NOW TURN TO THE ADDITIONAL. ONE TIME TEN MILLION DOLLAR REQUEST. WHICH WE WOULD SAY AT THIS POINT- IS A IS A CONSERVATIVE REQUEST AND IT COMES FROM TWO PRIMARY AREAS THE FIRST IS THE CASELOADS. WHICH YOU MAY BE AWARE OF- HIS BEEN REPORTED IN A VARIETY OF VENUES AND IS IN THE MATERIALS- THERE'S BEEN A 7% INCREASE. IN CASELOAD IN THE DEPENDENCY SYSTEM STATEWIDE AND 14% OF THAT IS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY THAT 14% INCREASE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY REFLECTS OVER FIVE THOUSAND MORE CHILDREN. THAN WE WOULD TYPICALLY HAVE IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM ON ANY GIVEN DAY. AND EACH OF THOSE CHILDREN COMES TO COURT HOPEFULLY WITH AT LEAST ONE PARENT SOMETIMES A VOTE SO WE ESTIMATE APPROXIMATELY. TEN THOUSAND ADDITIONAL CLIENTS JUST A LOS ANGELES. THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF SEVENTY CASELOADS. AT IF THOSE CASELOADS OF THE ATTORNEYS FOR THOSE CASES WERE FULLY FUNDED THAT WOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL THIRTEEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS BASED ON THE FORMULA THAT'S BEEN ADOPTED BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. ANOTHER WAY TO LOOK AT IT IS IF WE LOOK AT AND FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT IS PROJECTED IN THE BUDGET THAT WOULD BE A FOURTEEN POINT NINE MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE. ADDITIONALLY JUST ON MONDAY OF THIS WEEK THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL RELEASED THEIR PROPOSED ALLOCATION PER FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND AS WE EXPECTED. THERE WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT CUTS AROUND THE STATE IF THERE IS NOT EDITION ALL STATE FUNDING PUT INTO THAT BUDGET. THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL IDENTIFIED A THREE MILLION DOLLAR AGGREGATE. INCREASED MEDIA- WHICH WILL TRANSLATE TO. INCREASES AND ONLY SIXTEEN COUNTIES AND SEVEN OF THOSE INCREASES ARE UNDER TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS SOME ARE ONLY A FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS AND ONLY THREE. LOS ANGELES. FRESNO ORANGE. I ORANGE WOULD ANY OF THAN A- THOUSAND DOLLAR. CONVERSELY WHEN IT IS ON. UNDER THE- FORM THANK THAT GO THE- STATE BUNNIES MANY OTHER COUNTIES SOME WHO EXPERIENCED INCREASES IN CASELOADS WILL HAVE THEIR ALLOCATIONS REDUCED OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS SO THAT'S THIRTY NINE COUNTIES. THAT WAS THE CUTS TO THEIR DEPENDENCY BUDGETS EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY NOT HAVE HAD A REDUCTION IN CASELOAD AND IN SOME CASES MAY HAVE HAD AN INCREASING CASELOAD. COULD YOU COULD YOU WOULD WRAP IT UP- SURE I'M- THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. THE LAST THING I'LL JUMP TO THE END OF THE CALL THAT IMPACTS- WEIGHTS IN THAT THE JCC DID ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE HAS NOT BEEN SAVINGS- BECAUSE EVERY MO CORE AND TO THE COUNTRY TO THE DEPENDENCY PROVIDERS KOPIN HAS COST US HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN RELATED EXPENSES TECH PP BACKFILLING POSITIONS FOR STAFF FOR AN FMLA LAPTOPS FOR STAFF CREATING REMOTE ACCESS FOR CLIENTS WHICH I WILL ADDRESS LATER IF I CAN WHEN THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT REMOTE COURT- AND NONE OF THAT HAS BEEN. RATE HAS HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY ANY STATE FUNDING SO UNLIKE THE GOVERNMENT ENTITIES THAT HAVE RECEIVED FOR EXAMPLE THE JCC SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THE DEPENDENCY PROVIDERS HAVE HAD TO ABSORB ALL OF THOSE COSTS OF THE IMPACT OF COMBAT HAS BEEN TREMENDOUS ONE ORGANIZATIONS SPENT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ON INTERPRETERS ALONE. I'M AND I CAN PROVIDE ADDITIONAL D. AS OF THOSE IN IF THERE'S TIMELY OR IN WRITING THANK YOU FOR YOUR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OF A- WILL END LIBBY'S. FROM S. TELL. THAT AFTERNOON MATTER CHAIR SAY ON THE OF S. I. U. REP CORE EMPLOYEE AND CO THROUGHOUT THIS THANK YOU FOR THIS OP TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY I TO SEE BY. MYSELF THE CALM MAY BY THE OTHER PANEL TODAY AND RECOGNIZING US YEAH YOU SUPPORT FOR ALL OF THE BUDGET ASKS THAT THEY HAVE PROPOSED I'D ALSO LIKE TO SPEAK BRIEFLY ON THE PROPOSAL WE HEARD IMMEDIATELY PRIOR WERE GUARDING- THE- SPECIALTY COURTS WANTED TO NOTE THERE IS PRIOR PRECEDENTS FOR THE LEGISLATURE ALLOCATING SPECIFIC DEDICATED FUNDING TO SPECIALTY COURTS SEIU IS A HUGE FAN OF SPECIALTY COURTS BUT I WOULDN'T BE A C. I. U. F. I DIDN'T MAKE THE POINT. THAT ONE OF THE MOST INTEGRAL COMPONENTS OF SPECIALTY COURTS SHOULD BE PROVIDING WRAP AROUND SERVICES USING COUNTY PUBLIC SOCIAL SERVICES STAFF SO ANY PROPOSAL TO ALLOCATE SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING FOR SPECIALTY COURTS WE HOPE WOULD ALSO. INCORPORATE THAT REQUEST- I'M HERE TODAY TO REALLY SPEAK UP COURT EMPLOYEE SPECIFICALLY REPORTERS AND- AND WHAT HAS BEEN GOING ON IN OUR WORLD IN THE COURTS MOST RECENTLY. COURT REPORTERS PLAY A VITAL AND INTEGRAL ROLE NOT ONLY IN OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM GENERALLY BUT MORE SPECIFICALLY IN ENSURING EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE COURT REPORTERS ARE TASKED WITH PROVIDING THE OFFICIAL VERBATIM RECORD OF COURT PROCEEDINGS. TRANSCRIPTS OF THESE PROCEEDINGS PRODUCED BY COURT REPORTERS LITERALLY MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A LITIGANT BEING ABLE TO FULLY EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS ON APPEAL. OR THOSE RIGHTS BEING ALL BUT ILLUSORY IN FACT THE RIGHT TO A COURT REPORTER AND EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE IS SO INEXTRICABLY LINKED. INDIGENT LITIGANTS HAVE A GUARANTEED RIGHT TO A COURT REPORTER PURSUANT TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE SUPREME COURT DECISION IN JAMISON BE DESKTOP IT'S NOT IMPORTANT NO TRANSCRIPT NO APPEAL NO COURT REPORTER NO TRANSCRIPT. BUT HERE'S THE PROBLEM THERE'S BEEN A CREATED CRISIS OF A LACK OF OFFICIAL COURT REPORTERS IN THE COURTS THROUGHOUT ALIFORNIA BORN VIA A COMBINATION OF LAYOFFS FURLOUGH DAYS EXPENDITURE ON ELECTRONIC RECORDING EQUIPMENT STAGNATING WAGES AND THE STATUTORY TRANSCRIPT RATE WHICH IS NOT SEEN AN INCREASE IN THIRTY TWO YEARS. THAT'S RIGHT OUR ONE HUNDRED AND FIVE YEAR OLD STATUTORY RAPE BY WHICH OFFICIAL COURT REPORTERS ARE BOUND HAS ONLY SEEN ONE INCREASE IN IT SINCE ITS INCEPTION. AND I WAS THIRTY TWO YEARS AGO. ORDERS ARE PAY INTO WAYS THEY'RE SO AS EMPLOY FOR THEIR TIME SPENT IN THE COURTS TRANSCRIBING THE OFFICIAL VERBATIM RECORD AND IS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS FOR TRANSCRIPT PROCREATION PRODUCTION. THE CURRENT STATUTORY RATE HAS NOT KEPT PACE WITH THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS WHICH INCLUDES COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR TECHNOLOGICAL DEVICES COMPUTER PROGRAMMING SYSTEMS PAPER STORAGE AND EVEN POSTED. YES WE HAVE INSTANCES OF COURT REPORTERS OR SPENDING MORE MONEY ON POSTAGE FOR TRANSCRIPT THAN THEY ACTUALLY GET PAID FOR THE TRANSCRIPT. THE UNFORTUNATE REALITY IS THAT THINGS HAVE GOTTEN SO BAD THAT THE COMBINATION OF SALARY IN TRANSCRIPT RATE STAGNATION BUT IT IS BECOME MORE LUCRATIVE FOR COURT REPORTERS TO WORK AS FREELANCERS AS THEY CAN CHARGE EIGHT TIMES THE STATUTORY RATE ON THE OPEN MARKET. AND ALL THAT DOES IS FURTHER WIDENED EVER GROWING CHASM BETWEEN THE TWO SYSTEMS OF JUSTICE ONE FOR THE RICH AND ONE FOR THE POOR WHERE WEALTHY LEAD AGAINST CAN HIRE PRIVATE JUDGES AND FREELANCE REPORTERS AND THOSE OF LIMITED MEANS. WHO MUST RELY ON COURT REPORTERS TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS UNDER THE LAW DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE ACCESS TO THE COURTS HAVE NOT BEEN COMPLYING WITH JAMESON BE DUSTED DECISION IN ANY REAL WAY. THERE'S NO OBLIGATION UNDER EXISTING LAW THE INDIGENT LITIGANTS ARE ADEQUATELY AND APPROPRIATELY INFORMED OF THEIR RIGHTS UNDER THE LAW NOR IS THERE ANY OBLIGATION THAT THEY BE ADVISED OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR RIGHTS UNDER APPEAL. SHOULD THEY NOT HAVE A COURT REPORTER. FURTHER THE QUARTER NOT ON NOT HIRING FOR. SAID THEY MAY BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH AMOS AND THE COURTS HAVE SO REDUCED THE NUMBER OF COURT REPORTERS. VIA LAYOFFS FOR THE DAYS AND FAILING TO RECRUIT REPLACEMENTS THAT IT ALL BUT IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPLY. JUST LAST WEEK SEVEN COURT REPORTERS AND THREE COURT CLERKS WERE LAID OFF IN ALAMEDA COUNTY. UNDER THE AUSPICES OF NECESSARY BUDGET CUTS THE SAME KIND IT COUNTY THAT WE JUST HEARD ABOUT THE REMOTE REPORTING EXPERIENCE AND JUDICIAL COUNCIL CLAIMS THAT THERE BEEN NO LAYOFFS AS IT RELATES TO REMOTE. RECORDING PROCEDURES AND- AND APPEARANCES. DESPITE OUR BEGGING AND PLEADING WITH THE COURT EXECUTIVE OFFICER TO RETAIN THESE VITAL EMPLOYEES AND DESPITE EVERYONE'S UNDERSTANDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL BE PASSING A BUDGET WITH COURT DOCUMENTATION DOLLARS IN A MATTER OF WEEKS. THESE ESSENTIAL PLEASE UPON WHOM THE PEOPLE OF ALAMEDA COUNTY MUST RELY TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS UNDER THE LAW. UNCEREMONIOUSLY AND CRUELLY LET GO. WE HAVE TWO BUDGET PROPOSALS WE HAVE SUBMITTED TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES THE FIRST IS A TWENTY EIGHT CENT PER FOLIO INCREASED OF THE STATUTORY TRANSCRIPT RATE. AT A COST OF SEVEN POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR THE SECOND IS A THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL INVESTMENT TO THE COURTS FOR THE PURPOSES OF HIRING AND RETAINING. OFFICIAL COURT REPORTERS FOR PURPOSES OF COMPLYING WITH JAMESON BE DESKTOP. NOW ON TO COURTS IN THE TIME OF COLD IT ALSO AN EXTRA BIG INEXTRICABLY LINKED IS THE EXPERIENCE OF OUR COURT REPORTERS WORKING IN THE COURTS DURING THE PANDEMIC AND OUR POSITION ON THE PROPOSAL. TO MAKE PROMOTE PROCEEDINGS AND APPEARANCES PERMANENT. OUR COURT REPORTERS ARE NOT ONLY TASKED WITH PROVIDING THE OFFICIAL VERBATIM RECORD THEIR LICENSES DEPEND ON IT. DURING COVERT WE HAD A RAMPANT PROBLEM STATEWIDE IN EVERY COURT IN EVERY COURTROOM. WITH BEING ABLE. TO DO OUR JOBS BECAUSE WE SIMPLY HE COULDN'T HEAR. WE ALL THE ON SAY. THE POWER YEAR WORSE HAS. OR THEIR VOTE AS MARC OR THEY GOT DROPPED OFF ENTIRE. OUR REPORT EXTRA ALL OF THAT AND MORE. THIS YEAR JUDGES MUTING ARE FAILING TO MUTE- LAWYERS PARTIES OR WITNESSES PEOPLE TALKING OVER ONE ANOTHER PEOPLE WITHOUT CAMERAS MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DISCERN WHO WAS SPEAKING AND WHEN- WE EVEN HAVE ONE INSTANCE WHERE WE HAD TWO OPPOSING SIDES LET AGAINST AND ONE INTERPRETER- THE TO LITIGANTS WERE NOT IN. ENGLISH SPEAKERS AND THEY WERE ALL ON ONE PHONE LINE AND OUR COURT REPORTER WAS COMPLETELY UNABLE TO DISCERN WHO IS SPEAKING OR WHAT WAS BEING SAID. BUT THE EXISTING TECHNOLOGY JUST DOES NOT WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE IN ORDER TO ENSURE EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE. THEY HAVEN'T REVIEWED THINGS LIKE HOW DO PEOPLE WITH- HEARING LIMITATIONS PEOPLE WITH LIMITED ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY- HOW DO THEY PARTICIPATE IN THE SYSTEM EQUALLY AND GET EQUAL ACCESS uJUSTICE. CORTESE MADE A POINT ABOUT REALLY LIMITING THE TYPES OF PROCEEDINGS BUT EVEN WITHIN THAT WHEN YOU DRILL DOWN THERE ARE IMPLICATIONS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN CONSIDERED YOU KNOW THERE ARE- CRIMES OF MORAL TO. TURPITUDE THAT ARE YOU KNOW ON THE FEDERAL LISTS THAT ARE ONLY INFRACTIONS BUT IF YOU PLEAD DOWN FROM A MISDEMEANOR- THERE ARE IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES TO THAT SO WE CANNOT PUT ANYBODY AT A DISADVANTAGE PARTICULARLY THOSE. THAT ARE ALREADY SAYS YOUR ECONOMICALLY DISENFRANCHISED OR DISENFRANCHISED IN ANY OTHER WAY- SO WE STRONGLY URGE THE COMMITTEE TO REJECT THE TBL- TO EXPAND REMOTE FROM FROM BROKE MARMO PROCEEDINGS AND APPEARANCES AND MAKE THEM PERMANENT AND INSTEAD REALLY. TAKE A LONG HARD LOOK AT THE EXPERIENCE OF COURT USERS AND COURT WORKERS- DURING THE PANDEMIC. ON IN CLOSING- THE COURTS ARE YOU KNOW HAVE BEEN DRAMATICALLY UNDERFUNDED BUT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE REALLY ARE SEEING IS THAT THE FUNDING IS NOT BEING DEDICATED AND DIRECTED BY THE LEGISLATURE. IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL IMMEDIATELY DISTRIBUTE SET DOWN TO THE LOCAL LEVEL TO ENSURE THAT CORPORATIONS CAN CONTINUE. AND SO ANY ADDITIONAL DATA DEDICATION AND DIRECTION OF THE FUNDING ALLOCATED. TO ENSURECOURT OPERATIONS AND EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE. IS MOST APPRECIATED THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE- OF THE- AND YOUR CONTRIBUTION YOU ARE ON THE GROUND AND WHAT YOU SAY HAS ENORMOUS VALUE FOR ALL OF US- MISS SANCHEZ JUST- COMMENTED. ABOUT THE A PROPOSAL FOR EXPANDING REMOTE COURT PROCEEDINGS- I JUST WANNA ASK MAYBE ONE OTHER MEMBER OF THE PANEL MAYBE MISS. MARC COULD YOU- GIVE A SHORT OF YOUR OPINION AS TO THIS PROPOSAL TO EXPAND REMOTE COURT PROCEEDINGS. THANK YOU YES WE WOULD BE IN SUPPORT OF THAT OUR- OUR STAFF HAS BEEN ABLE TO FULLY FUNCTION- I'M WORKING REMOTELY. OBVIOUSLY IN SOME CASES- WE WOULD PREFER IN PERSON AND LIKE IN THE INSTANCE OF A JURY TRIAL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT- GENERALLY WE DO SUPPORT REMOTE PROCEEDINGS. OKAY- OKAY AND UP YES MISS HI MARK. I THINK I'M GETTING WORSE FOR PRONOUNCING THANK YOU VERY MUCH I DID ALSO JUST WANT TO COMMENT ON THE REMOTE COURT PROCEEDINGS- QUICKLY WE SUPPORT THE FLEXIBILITY THAT REMOTE PROCEEDINGS OFFER BUT WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE LANGUAGE AS IT IS IN THE TRAILER BUDGET BILL AT THIS TIME- BECAUSE IT DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEAD AGAINST TO HAVE A SAY IN WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL BE REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE REMOTELY WE THINK THE LANGUAGE THAT APPLIES TO THE INFRACTIONS IS MORE APPROPRIATE. THAN A LANGUAGE THAT IS MUCH MORE BROAD- A FOR THE CIVIL PROCEEDINGS INDEPENDENCE WE HAVE BEEN FULLY REMOTE INDEPENDENCE A CART L. A. COUNTY IN TWENTY EIGHT COURTROOM SINCE JUNE SO WE HAVE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE WITH pHAVE TO SAY THAT THE VIEW FROM THE BENCH AT TIMES IS DIFFERENT THAN THE VIEW FROM THE WELL- AND THERE HAVE BEEN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE REMOTE PROCESS IS EXCELLENT IN OTHERS WHERE IT IS RIGHT VERY VERY CHALLENGING IT DOES NOT ALWAYS. PROVIDE EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE EQUAL ACCESS TO THE COURT PROCESS- AND PUTS LITIGANTS ANDERSON EXTREME DISADVANTAGE AND AT TIMES EVEN IN DANGER- OR THEIR EMOTIONAL WELL BEING ESPECIALLY IN THE DEPENDENCY ARENA IS SERIOUSLY NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE REMOTE PROCEEDING- AGAIN I WILL BE PROVIDING MORE EXTENSIVE WRITTEN COMMENT BECAUSE I KNOW WE'RE SHORT ON TIME THEY DID WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WE THINK THAT THEY CONCERNS RAISED BY THE LA ARE SPOT ON AND THAT IF THE LEGISLATURE DOES MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS ITEM THAT IT SHOULD HAVE SOME- RESTRICTIONS AND GUIDELINES AND ENSURE THAT THE LITIGANTS HAVE THE ULTIMATE ABILITY TO REQUEST IN PERSON. OR A QUESTION ABOUT A REMOTE AND IT NOT BE A 100% DETERMINED- WITHOUT THEIR INPUT AND THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO BE IN PERSON IF THAT IS WHAT THE CASE DEMANDS. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MEMBERS QUESTIONS ARE COMMON THEY JUST WANT SEE THE MANAGER I JUST WANNA SAY A- THE DIVERSITY OF TESTIMONY HERE AND IT KIND OF GIVES. READ IT'S TO WHAT YOU WERE SAYING THAT- IN YOUR EARLIER COMMENTS ON THE EARLIER ITEM THAT. BUT THERE'S A LOT HERE THAT NEEDS TO BE FLUSHED OUT STILL IN AB JUST PARTED ISSUES HEARING FROM EVERYONE IN GETTING. ALL THE FACTS ON THE TABLE I THINK- SOME OF THE THINGS WE HEAR. S. CONCERNS. AGAIN WOULD WOULD EXIST REMOTELY OR IN PERSON- AND WE'VE ALL FOR EXAMPLE I AM I'M NOT PICKING ON EITHER WITNESSES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE I TAKE ALL THIS VERY VERY SERIOUSLY- THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE FOR EXAMPLE WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH AND YOU KNOW SEEING THE CASES OF- YOU KNOW I SEE JUST WALKING RIGHT INTO COURT ROOMS- BEEN AND I'M NOT SURE. IF YOU WERE HERE IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AGAIN TO REITERATE THAT THE POLICY COMMITTEE BUT I. YEP YOU KIND OF WONDER WHAT. WHAT IF YOUR POLICY IT- GOAL IS PROTECTION OF THOSE LITIGANTS- WHICH IS BETTER AT EIGHT MAYBE IT'S BETTER TO BE OFFSITE I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS. ALL THAT NEEDS TO BE THOUGHT THROUGH- A LOT MORE THING FROM OUR STANDPOINT SO- THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE'LL HAVE TO DO THANK YOU THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY GO. THANK YOU SENATOR CENTER NEWMAN THANK YOU MANAGER I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE- MISS CHANGES IS A TESTIMONY WITH RESPECT TO. THE COURT REPORTER ISSUE IN THE CLEARLY THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT'S GONE UNADDRESSED FOR. FAR TOO LONG- BUT AS WE CONSIDER OTHER CHANGES PARTICULARLY THE IMPLEMENTATION TECHNOLOGY CHANGES- THIS IS AN EASILY ADDRESS PROBLEM ALL THINGS CONSIDERED I MEAN AS FAR AS THE BUDGET GOES SO THAT'S THE EASY PART. THE HARD PART IS TO FIGURE OUT HOW WITHIN THIS KIND OF BROTH EVOLUTION TECHNOLOGY WE TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT THAT THE FIRST THING WE SHOULD DO IS MAKE SURE THAT WE CERTAINLY PAY FOR. THE NECESSARY TRANSCRIPT ABILITY A PARTICULAR WHERE IT CREATES. SERIOUS SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH RESPECT TO APPEAL. AB SORRY I JUST WANT OF SIZE THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD. WONDERFUL OKAY. DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER. NO UP. OKAY WELL AGAIN- I REALLY FOR. THE MEMBERS OF THE PANEL THAT CAME FORWARD. YOU GAVE US SOME.

OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT HERE NO MORE PRESS A CALL THING TO VERY MUCH YOU- WE MOVE ON- ISSUE TWENTY FIVE. ISSUE TWENTY FIVE IT FALLS UNDER THE BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS AND THIS IS ON STRENGTHENING JAIL OVERSIGHT- IS THAT MISS HOWARD. YES GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR DORADO MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- MY NAME IS KATIE HOWARD I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE B. S. C. C. HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THIS SPRING FINANCE LETTER E. C. P. THAT'S DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO THE V. ASSISI'S INSPECTION RESPONSIBILITIES ON THE SAYS I AM VERY PLEASED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FOLLOW UP ON THE CONVERSATION WE HAD. DURING THE MARCH BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE HEARING ON THE TOPIC OF OUR INSPECTIONS AND THE RECENT REPORT FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND THIS B. C. P. TRULY HELPS TO PROVIDE THE RESOURCES THAT WE NEED TO FULFILL THE NEW DIRECTION WE HAVE FROM THE GOVERNOR TO STRENGTHEN JAIL OVERSIGHT SO I WANT TO GIVE A VERY VERY HIGH LEVEL SUMMARY OF THE B. C. P. AND ON THAT OF COURSE I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THERE ARE TWO COMPONENTS TO THIS B. C. P. PROPOSAL ONE IS- THE ADDITION OF VERY- IMPORTANT STAFFING RESOURCES SO THAT WE CAN DO MORE WITH OUR JAIL INSPECTION AND LOCAL DETENTION FACILITY INSPECTION RESPONSIBILITIES- IT'S FOURTEEN POSITIONS EIGHT INSPECTORS AND THEN SIX ANALYSTS AND MANAGERS TO MANAGE ALL THE INFORMATION DATA COLLECTION AND OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR INSPECTION FUNCTION. AND THEN THE SECOND COMPONENT IS- A STATUTORY CHANGE THAT MAKES IT CLEAR THAT OUR INSPECTORS WOULD HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO SOME OF OUR INSPECTIONS UNANNOUNCED SO THOSE ARE THE TWO COMPONENTS OF THE PROPOSAL AND I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT WE BELIEVE THE THIS BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL WILL DO- THE BIGGEST CHANGES THAT THE INSPECTIONS WILL BE CONDUCTED ANNUALLY AT LEAST ONCE EACH YEAR RATHER THAN. OVER A TWO YEAR OR DANIEL CYCLE ON THERE WILL BE SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL CAPACITY FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE COUNTIES TO CORRECT ANY COMPLIANCE ISSUES THAT ARE IDENTIFIED AND TO WORK WITH AGENCIES. TO DEVELOP RESPONSIVE CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS- IT'LL ALSO ALLOW FOR MUCH MORE REGULAR PUBLIC REPORTING AND FOLLOW UP WITH OUR BOARD AT PUBLIC MEETINGS ABOUT THE ITEMS OF NON COMPLIANCE. AND THAT INCLUDES DIRECTING AGENCIES TO APPEAR BEFORE THE BOARD WHEN ITEMS OF NON COMPLIANCE REMAIN ON CORRECT UNCORRECTED- WE WILL HAVE STREAMLINED PROCESS SEES AND A FAR BETTER ABILITY TO MANAGE ALL OF THE DATA AND REPORTING. IN SUPPORT OF THIS STRONGER COMPLIANCE FUNCTION AND- AS I ALREADY MENTIONED THE SPECIFIC AUTHORIZATION FOR UNANNOUNCED INSPECTIONS SO WE ARE- VERY PLEASED AND VIEW THIS AS A BIG STEP TOWARD. MEETING THAT DIRECTION THAT WE'VE BEEN GIVEN TO STRENGTHENED JAIL OVERSIGHT. HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. OKAY THANK YOU MISS HOWARD- L. A. O. PLEASE GIVE YOUR COMMENTS. IF K. O'NEILL. IT RUNNER NOW WITH THE LEGISLATIVE OFFICE AND STAFF ASKED ME TO PROVIDE A BET A BRIEF SUMMARY OF OUR REPORT ON THE BOARD'S STANDARDS AND INSPECTION PROGRAM THAT WE RELEASED IN FEBRUARY SO I'LL GO AHEAD AND DO THAT UNLESS YOU HAVE ANY OBJECTIONS MIND CHAIR- AND THEN I WILL GET INTO OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE PROPOSAL FOR YOU TODAY. UNDERFILL THERE ARE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY LOCAL DETENTION FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA. THAT ARE THESE ARE OPERATED BY COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT'S INFORMATION DEPARTMENTS AS WELL AS CITY POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND THE HOUSE. ADULTS AND JUVENILES IN VARIOUS STAGES OF THE ADULT AND JUVENILE JUVENILE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS. THE BSE C. IS OVERSEEN BY THIRTEEN MEMBER BOARD. SEVEN OF THE SLOTS ARE DESIGNATED FOR LEADERS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES FOURTEENTH OVER AT SIXTY FOUR OF HIM OVERSEE FACILITIES THAT ARE INSPECTED BY THE PROGRAM. STATUTE CURRENTLY REQUIRES THE SEC TO DO THREE THANKS ONE REVISE THE STAIR CONSIDER REVISING THE STANDARDS ONCE EVERY TWO YEARS AND THE SEC DOES THIS ESSENTIALLY THROUGH- VOLUNTEER WORKING GROUP'S THAT MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE BOARD. TO INSPECT EACH FACILITY ONCE EVERY TWO YEARS WHICH THE FCC DOES THROUGH A- TEAM OF ABOUT EIGHT STAFF INSPECTORS. AND THREE TO SUBMIT INSPECTION REPORTS TO LOCAL OFFICIALS AND A SUMMARY REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE EVERY OTHER YEAR. AND I ALSO WANT TO KNOW THE BSE IS NOT AUTHORIZED TO ENFORCE THE STANDARDS. IT DOES HOWEVER PROVIDE SOME TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AS IT GOES ABOUT ITS- INSPECTION ACTIVITIES THOUGH IT IS NOT REQUIRED TO STATUTORILY. IN THE BUDGET FOR THE PROGRAM IS ABOUT TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS CURRENTLY. AND AS WAS MENTIONED- AB I MISS HOWARD DAY GOVERNOR IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY DIRECTED THE SEC TO MAKE THREE CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM AND CITING- CITING INADEQUATE OR INSUFFICIENT OVERSIGHT AND JAILS AS PART OF HIS RATIONALE FOR THOSE CHANGES AND THOSE ARE TWO ONE ALIGN STANDARDS WITH BEST PRACTICE YES YOU SEE INDICATES THAT THEY'RE DOING THIS- BY PROVIDING THE WORK GROUPS THAT CONSIDER REVISIONS TO THE STANDARD WITH. ADDITIONAL MATERIALS TO REVIEW ON WHAT MIGHT BE BEST PRACTICES- FOR DIFFERENT LOCAL DETENTION FACILITIES TO CONDUCT ADDITIONAL INSPECTIONS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AT FACILITIES WITH A HISTORY OF NON COMPLIANCE WHICH UP UNTIL THIS- APRIL FINANCE LETTER WHICH I'LL DISCUSS IN A MOMENT- THE SEC HAD INDICATED IT WOULD DO WITHIN EXISTING RESOURCES WAS ESSENTIALLY GOING TO BE STEPPING UP INSPECTIONS- DOING SOME ADDITIONAL INSPECTIONS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- WITHIN EXISTING RESOURCES BUT NOW IT'S REQUESTING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO GO FURTHER. ESSENTIALLY- AND THEN THREE TO INVITE LEADERS OF NON COME AS A TO PUBLIC MEETINGS TO DISCUSS THAT REASONS BEHIND THEIR- NON COMPLIANCE. AND SO MOVING INTO OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE PROGRAM AND IT'S REALLY VERY SIMPLE. WHEN WE LOOK AT ANY PROGRAM WE ASK WHAT IS THE MISSION AND GOALS OF THIS PROGRAM IS IT MEETING THOSE GOALS. AND IN THIS CASE WE FOUND THAT THE MISSION AND GOALS OF THE PROGRAM ARE NOT CLEAR AND THAT LEAVES DISCRETION TO THE ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE LIKE I SAID THERE'S THREE PRETTY. SIMPLE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS AND THAT THE PROGRAM MUST FILL AND THERE'S A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT A PROGRAM COULD FULFILL THOSE- AND IN TURN PURSUE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT. GOALS IN DOING SO- FOR EXAMPLE ONE CAN WRITE A REPORT THAT'S GEARED TOWARD PRIMARILY AN AUDIENCE OF- CORRECTIONAL ADMINISTRATORS OR ONE COULD WRITE A REPORT GEARED TOWARD- MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC BOTH WOULD FILL THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENT BUT EACH WOULD ACHIEVE A DIFFERENT GOAL- AND SO THIS LACK OF GOALS. AND CLEAR GOALS AND MISSION IN ADDITION MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM ALSO UNDERMINES LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OF THE PROGRAM. SO AT A HIGH LEVEL OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE TO ESTABLISH A CLEAR MISSION AND GOALS AND STATUTES FOR THE PROGRAM. AND THEN TO ALIGN THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE BOARD- I'M IN THE PROGRAM STRUCTURE ITSELF WITH THOSE MISSION AND GOALS. AND OF COURSE THE LEGISLATURE COULD USE ANY GOALS- THAT IT. DESIRES BUT WE IN OUR REPORT DIDN'T RECOMMEND AND CERTAIN GOAL AND MISSION AND CERTAIN GOALS. AND NOT RECOMMENDED MISSION IS TO PROMOTE LEGAL HUMANE AND SAFETY CONDITIONS IN LOCAL DETENTION FACILITIES. AND THEN THE GOALS- WE RECOMMEND FOR SPECIFICALLY- TO SUPPORT THAT BROADER MISSION. WE CAME UP WITH THESE GOALS BY THINKING ABOUT. BEST PRACTICE LOOKING OPSEC CURRENTLY DOES TALKING TO VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS EXCITER AND THINKING ABOUT WHAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR THE STATE TO DO VERSUS OTHER. ENTITIES IN THIS OVER OUR OVERALL KIND OF OVERSIGHT ECOSYSTEM AROUND- LOCAL JAILS- LOCAL DETENTION FACILITIES AND THOSE GOALS WE CAME UP WITH AND RECOMMEND OUR ONE. HOPE LOCAL LEADERS DETERMINE AND MEET LEGAL REQUIREMENTS- AROUND DETENTION FACILITY OPERATIONS THIS IS- WHAT WE HAVEN'T COME TO UNDERSTAND IT SEEMS IS BY AND LARGE WHAT HOW THE S. THE PRIMARY GOAL THAT THE FCC HAS SORT OF BEEN FORMALLY OPERATED. AND TOWARD IF YOU WILL AND THEN VIEW BY AND LARGE WHAT PROPOSED CHANGES CAN TO SUPPORT WHICH I'LL GET INTO IN A MINUTE- BUT WE RECOMMEND AND WE DO THINK THAT'S A LOT OF- AN IMPORTANT GOAL SO WE RECOMMEND. ESTABLISHING THAT AS A GOAL WE ALSO RECOMMEND ESTABLISHING AND THREE MORE SAID THE SECOND ONE BEING TO FACILITATE TRANSPARENCY SO THAT LOCAL LEADERS AND STAKEHOLDERS. CAN HOLD FACILITIES ACCOUNTABLE SHOULD THEY CHOOSE TO DO SO. THREE TO PROMOTE EQUITABLE PROVISION OF LEGAL HUMANE AND SAFE CONDITIONS AND FOR TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND STATEWIDE LEADERSHIP TO FACILITATE SYSTEMIC IMPROVEMENT. AND WE RECOMMEND- LIKE I SAID THAT THE LEGISLATURE- I AM REVISED STATUTE TO CHANGE BOARD MEMBERSHIP TO ALIGN WITH THESE- GOALS BECAUSE WE FOUND THAT THE CURRENT BOARD IS NOT ALIGNED WITH THOSE FOUR GOALS. AND IN ADDITION TO REQUIRE EIGHT SPECIFICALLY WE FOUND THAT THERE WAS A LACK OF- MEMBERSHIP DESIGNATED SLOTS FOR PEOPLE WITH PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE. IN AN AFGHAN ADVOCACY AND OVERSIGHT OF DETENTION CONDITIONS- AND THEN WE RECOMMEND DIRECTING THE SEC TO PROVIDE A PLAN TO THE LEGISLATURE AND HOW IT WILL ALIGN THE PROGRAM WITH WHATEVER GOALS THE LEGISLATURE SETS- AND IN. KEEPING WITH THE FOUR GOALS THAT WE RECOMMEND WE CAME UP WITH SPECIFIC ELEMENTS WHICH WE DESCRIBE IN DETAIL MORE DETAIL IN THE REPORT AND WE THINK THE PLAN SHOULD HAVE- AND THESE THESE INCLUDE- I PLAN TO CREATE MORE SPECIFIC. STANDARDS BECAUSE WE FOUND THAT THE STANDARDS WE THINK ARE NOT SPECIFIC ENOUGH- AS WELL AS A PLAN TO ENSURE THAT THE STANDARDS ARE EQUITABLE- AND IN ORDER TO MAKE THESE CHANGES WE THINK THERE NEED TO BE SOME CHANGES TO THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE WORK GROUPS. AND SO THERE'S A VARIETY OF OTHER ELEMENTS OF THIS PURPOSE- OF THIS PLAN THAT SHE ALMONDS THAT WE THINK SHOULD BE IN THIS PLAN- THAT WE LAID OUT IN THE REPORT AND HAPPY TO GO INTO MORE DETAIL IF ANY OF THAT- MEMBERS WOULD LIKE. BUT IN ANY OF TIME I WILL. AND MOVE ON. I JUST WANT TO MAKE AND FIRST OF ALL BEFORE MOVING ON- RECORDS ON THE APRIL FINANCE LETTER I DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW WHEN. WHEN HE PIECE ABOUT OUR REPORT IS THAT. ONE ELEMENT THAT IS NOT- WE DO NOT NECESSARILY RECOMMEND EXPLICITLY BE INCLUDED IN THE PLAN. IS AN ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM NBCC HAS MENTIONED DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE AN ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM- THE REASON WE DON'T. RECOMMEND ADDING ONE NECESSARILY IS BECAUSE THERE IS- CURRENTLY AN ATTORNEY GENERAL OPINION LONGSTANDING OPINION. DETERMINING THAT THE STANDARDS ARE NOT STATE I'M REIMBURSABLE MANDATES BECAUSE THE FCC DOESN'T HAVE AN ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM. SO OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE KEY ELEMENTS THAT WE RECOMMEND THIS PLAN INCLUDED ARE CRAFTED VERY INTENTIONALLY- TO. USE TRANSPARENCY AND TECHNICAL SUCH ASSISTANCE AS MORE OF THE SORT OF STEERING OF CHANGES APPROACH AS OPPOSED TO ENFORCEMENT- IN AN ATTEMPT TO M. INTENTIONALLY TO AVOID A POTENTIAL MANDATE BUT ALSO- MORE POSITION THE STATE TO BE ASSISTING LOCAL STATE STAKEHOLDERS- IN HOLDING THEIR FACILITIES ACCOUNTABLE RATHER THAN THE STATE DOING IT THROUGH ENFORCEMENT- I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT. AND THEN MOVING ON TO OUR COMMENTS ON THE BUDGET PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU TODAY. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE IT'S INTERESTED IN TAKING OUR RECOMMENDATIONS- FOR REFORMING THE BOARD. WE THINK IT WOULD BE PROMOTE PREMATURE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM AT THIS TIME GIVEN THAT ONCE IT HAS THIS PLAN DIED AND WE RECOMMEND IT. DIRECT THESEC TO PROVIDE WE THINK IT WOULD BE IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION TO ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE NEEDED FOR THE PROGRAM. HOWEVER ON THE FLIP SIDE TO THE EXTENT THE LEGISLATURE CHOOSES NOT TO- IMPLEMENT OUR RECOMMENDED REFORMS THEN WE FIND THAT THE PROPOSED EXPANSION IS UNNECESSARY- AND THIS IS BECAUSE- WE FIND THAT THE- CURRENT PROGRAM AS WELL AS AND THE PROPOSED EXPANSION WOULD BY AND LARGE SEEM TO SUPPORT. THE FCC'S CURRENT TERM INFORMAL GOAL OF PROVIDING SERVICE TO LOCAL AGENCIES IN THE FORM OF HELPING THEM- DETERMINE MEET LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND- WHAT WELL THAT IS ONE OF THE GOALS WE RECOMMEND IT'S NOT. IT'S AND WE DO RECOMMEND THREE OTHER GOALS WHICH AND BY AND LARGE THAT DOES SEEM TO BE THE AREAS- WHEN WE LOOKED AT AT AT WHERE THE PROGRAM WE NEED IT AND THE BOARD AND THANK AND SUCH WOULD NEED TO BE REFORMED. TO ME WE DID NOT WE HAVEN'T HEARD- AND THE SEC WAS NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT LOCAL AGENCIES ARE. DISSATISFIED. WITH THE CURRENT LEVEL OF SERVICE THEY RECEIVE. FROM BSE. AND THEN FINALLY. SO JUST TO WRAP THAT UP THAT HE SAID WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THE PROPOSED STAFFING AND ASSOCIATED RESOURCES- BECAUSE OF PREMATURE IF THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO GO WITH OUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND AN UNNECESSARY IF THE LEGISLATURE CHOOSES. NOT TO REFORM THE BOARD- BUT THERE ISN'T THERE ARE TWO SMALL PIECES WE DO RECOMMEND APPROVING ONE IS A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. ANNUALLY ON GOING TO- SO THAT TO FIND A CONTRACT TO ALLOW INSPECTORS TO IN- INPUT DATA ELECTRONICALLY WHILE THEY'RE DOING INSPECTIONS WHICH WE THINK. WOULD BE A USEFUL TOOL FOR THEM. I AND THEN BUDGET TRAILER LEGISLATION THAT WOULD. ALLOW INSPECTORS TO DO UNANNOUNCED VISITS BOTH OF THESE TOOLS WE THINK WOULD BE USEFUL UNDER THE CURRENT PROGRAM OR A POTENTIAL LAND REFORM PROGRAM IS WE RECOMMEND SO WE RECOMMEND GOING AHEAD AND IMPROVING DOES- AND THEN I'M HAPPY TAKE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU- I HAVE OF MISS HOWARD- OR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE RESPOND TO THE L. A. O.'S COMMENTS. BUT EIGHT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST NAMING DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I KNOW- SEGNO MENTIONED THAT. THESE RESOURCES ARE CURRENTLY UNNECESSARY BUT WE REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT IT'S- PROPOSAL ACTUALLY DOES STRENGTH AND BETTER OVERSIGHT OF COUNTY JAILS IN CALIFORNIA- BY PROVIDING MORE FREQUENT INSPECTIONS AND HAVING B. THE SEC DIRECT ANY- COUNTIES THAT ARE FOUND OUT OF COMPLIANCE TO APPEAR BEFORE THE BOARD. REALLY DOES INCREASE OVERALL TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY BY ENGAGING THE PUBLIC IN THE PROCESS- OF THE ANNUAL INSPECTIONS AND WATER FOUND THERE IN THOSE REPORTS ADDITIONALLY THE RESOURCES REQUESTED ANY ANALYTICAL STAFF- WOULD HELP TO. KIND OF MORE CONSISTENTLY AND REGULARLY TO PROVIDE UPDATES AS IN ESTONIA AGAIN MENTIONED AS FAR AS THE TARGET AUDIENCE BY KIND OF TRACKING CERTAIN TRENDS AND BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE- MORE ACCESSIBLE REPORTS AND FINDINGS OF WHAT THE SEC INSPECTORS FIND WHEN THEY DO THE ANNUAL INSPECTIONS. AND AGAIN JUST INCREASING THE NUMBER OF INSPECTIONS WE THINK IT. IS A MUCH BETTER USE OF RESOURCES BECAUSE IT WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR BMCC INSPECTORS TO FIND COUNTIES THAT ARE IN COMPLIANCE AND- POTENTIALLY OUT OF IN COMPLIANCE AND THEN AGAIN REPORT TO THE BOARD AND THE PUBLIC AT THOSE- OPEN HEARINGS. TO KIND OF ENGAGE OUR MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY AND VERY STAKEHOLDERS SO WE SO WE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE AND DO YOU THINK THIS PROPOSAL IS. IS VERY ATTENTIVE TO INCREASING. OVERSIGHT OF COUNTY JAILS. THANK YOU. A MISS HOW WOULD YOU LIE TO. ONLY JUST TO SUPPORT WHAT MR EDELMAN HAS SAID- WE THINK IT REALLY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY ABOUT WHAT OUR INSPECTION PROCESS IS FINDING. THANK YOU. I DO THINK OF THERE IS A FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM HERE. FOUR NINE IN AUGUST THERE'S SOME LEGAL ISSUES ABOUT THE BSE SEE NOT BEING AUTHORIZED TO ENFORCE OUR OUR STANDARDS AND SO DOING THE INSPECTIONS AND TAKING CERTAIN STEPS. OF SORT OF SEEMS TO GO AROUND THE EDGES INSTEAD OF RIGHT TO THE CORE OF THE ISSUE- IF THE STATE LAW DOES NOT AUTHORIZE I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A WAY OF FIXING THAT. BUT THERE'S GOTTA BE SOME MORE DIRECT TEETH PUT INTO THIS IT SEEMS TO ME THEN THE WAY THAT HAS BEEN DONE BECAUSE- OF WE CAN GO ON AND GIVE MORE AND MORE RESOURCES. BUT WHERE IS THAT NON COMPLIANCE GOING TO BE RESOLVED. AND HOW'S IT GOING TO BE RESOLVED. I THINK TO ME THAT'S A THAT'S A BIG ISSUE OF. MEMBERS QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS CENTER CORTESE. YEAH I WOULD AGREE WITH YOUR COMMENTS OF UNITY GUARDING. THE I CALL THE DILEMMA OF NOT HAVING COMPLIANCE IT IT ALMOST SEEMS LIKE- YOU KNOW ALTHOUGH WE- I THINK ALL US HERE PRESENTAR- VERY MUCH BELIEVERS IN TRANSPARENCY WITHOUT THE COMPLIANCE PIECE IT ALMOST SEEMS LIKE IT'S CREATING A ROAD MAP. OF FOR LITIGATION SO THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE POSTING ESPECIALLY PETE BEST IN THE- THE REAL TIME CONTRACT FREE FOR YOU KNOW IT'S A MODEST AMOUNT BUT HOW ARE WE ARE WE CONTRIBUTING- TO TRANSPARENCY. FOR THE WORLD WHICH FUNDAMENTALLY IS A GOOD THING BUT WITHOUT ANY WAITED TO- TO REMEDY THE PROBLEM ON OUR OWN WHICH- I'M HEARING YOU SAY BUT I'M SURE OF. IT ALL IN TO TRY TO HEAD OFF BECAUSE SOMEBODY HAVING TO BRING- LITIGATION A PRIVATE PARTY OR ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE OR. TOO MUCH THERE BUT IT IT DOES CONCERN ME AND- IT CONCERNS ME THAT IF WE KEEP GOING IN THAT DIRECTION WITHOUT COMPLIANCE WORDS INVESTING IN AN INFORMATIONAL SYSTEM. THAT THE- I GUESS SOMEONE CAN SAY TO WHAT END YOU KNOW TO WITHIN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THIRTY SEVEN ANYTHING ELSE.
