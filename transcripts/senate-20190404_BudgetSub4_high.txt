ALL RIGHT NOW LET'S SOME LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE -- FIFTEEN OKAY. LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE FIFTEEN SECRETARY OF GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY. WELCOME GOOD MORNING. DO NOT YET OFFICIALLY. BUT YOU ARE OFFICIALS I AM A FISH I I'VE BEEN APPOINTED I AM I WILL BE SWORN IN TOMORROW SO YOU'RE GETTING ME ON MY LAST DAY AS SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND JUST BEFORE I BECOME THE GOVERNOR SPECIAL ADVISER ON INNOVATION AND DIGITAL SERVICES. WELCOME CONGRADULATIONS THANK YOU. ARE YOU GONNA TALK TO US ABOUT THE OFFICE DIGITAL INNOVATION I AM OKAY. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR FOR YEAH YEAH MADAM MADAM MADAM CHAIR SENATOR UMBERG. I MICHAEL WILL CONTAIN RECENTLY APPOINTED AS THE GOVERNOR SPECIAL ADVISER ON INNOVATION AND DIGITAL SERVICE SAYS. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT FOR THIS PROPOSAL. AS YOU KNOW GOVERNMENTS FOR TOO LONG HAVE NEGLECTED TO THINK ABOUT THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE BEEN DELIVERING. GOVERNMENT SERVICES AND FUNCTIONS WHETHER IN PERSON THROUGH THE MAIL OR EVEN ONLINE. AS WE BROUGHT TECHNOLOGY AND OUR WORK WE'VE LARGER FOCUSED ON AUTOMATING THE EXISTING PROCESS SEES. AND WORK WAS BASED ON HOW WE THINK THANK SHOULD WORK. ARE TOO OFTEN BUT WE FAILED ASK ACTUAL PEOPLE. AND THAT WE SERVE WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE THAT ACCESS TO LOOK LIKE WHAT'S HELPFUL FOR THEM OR EVEN HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THE SERVICES THEY'RE BEING PROVIDED TO THEM. I INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY HISTORICALLY BEEN LARGELY ONE ONE OFF ONE DEPARTMENT ONE SOLUTION APPROACHES AND THEY ONLY HAPPEN AFTER AN INDIVIDUAL DEPARTMENT COMES IN WITH A SPECIFIC DEPARTMENT ON THE NO LONGER VIABLE APPROACH TO MEETING THE PUBLIC'S EXPECTATIONS. TECHNOLOGIES RADICALLY CHANGED OUR LIVES AND THE SOCIETY WE LIVE IN FROM HOW AND WHERE WE GET INFORMATION. CONDUCTOR FINANCIAL AFFAIRS SHOP ACCESS ENTERTAINMENT INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER. THE WORLD IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN EVEN A DECADE AGO. IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR COMPANIES COMPETE FOR CUSTOMERS ATTENTION IN BUSINESS BY DELIVERING WORLD CLASS USER EXPERIENCES THEY FOCUS ON THE CUSTOMER AND SO SHOULD GOVERNMENT. THIS PROPOSAL. IS ABOUT CHANGING CULTURE. VALUING INNOVATION INVESTING IN OUR WORK FORCE. DELIVERING GOVERNMENT SERVICES IN A WAY THAT IS ACCESSIBLE MEANINGFUL AND INTUITIVE TO THE PUBLIC WE SERVE. IMPROVING CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. RECOGNIZING THE INHERENT RISK IN THE STATUS QUO APPROACHES THAT WE CURRENTLY YEARS. CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE REASONABLE RISK TAKING IS NOT ONLY ACCEPTABLE BUT ENCOURAGE. IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE BACK. THIS IS NOT ABOUT BIG IT AND BIG PROJECTS. THE PROPOSAL IS GENERALLY BASED ON SUCCESSFUL MODELS WE'VE SEEN THROUGHOUT THE WORLD STARTING WITH THE U. K. DIGITAL SERVICE. AND HERE AT HOME WITH THE US DIGITAL SERVICE IN EIGHTEEN NOW FEDERAL LEVEL. THE SAN FRANCISCO DIGITAL SERVICES AND OTHER DIGITAL SERVICES AT VARIOUS LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT ROUTE THE WORLD. MOST PAUL FOLLOWS SIMILAR WELL ESTABLISHED LABOR. WHAT IS IT CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES BOTH THE SECRETARY AND UNDERSECRETARY? WE STARTED LAYING A FOUNDATION WHICH THIS OFFICE CAN SCALE AND BUILD ON WE STARTED WITH THE OPEN DATA. WE JUST STARTED FOCUSING ON THE CLIENT LOOKING AT WHAT SERVICES WE PROVIDE A PROCESS. BY WHICH PLANTS RECENT APPROXIMATE WELL SERVICES AND AND DEPARTMENTS. WE STARTED LOOKING AT OUR INTERNAL DATA. AND USING THAT TO INFORM DECISIONS AND PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO HOW THE PROGRAMS WERE OPERATING. WE ESTABLISHED THAT THE FIRST INNOVATION OFFICE IN THE STATE. AND WITH THE FIRST APPOINTED -- INNOVATION DIRECTOR SHANEAH ONE OFTEN WHO'S HERE IN THE AUDIENCE ALONG WITH HIS DEPUTY CONRAD RESENTED. THAT OFFICE IS COMPRISED COMPLETELY A STATE STAFF ON ONTO YOUR ROTATIONS -- I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO LOOK AT A COMBINATION OF BOTH STATE. AND PRIVATE SECTOR INDIVIDUALS TO BRING AND WHICH IS MUCH LIKE WITH THE US DIGITAL SERVICE DOES AND IT'S MODEL. IT PROVIDES THAT. THAT INSIGHT INTO HOW GOVERNMENT OPERATES BUT ALSO THAT THE IDEAS THAT ARE COMING OUT OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR. IN DIFFERENT WAYS TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS THAT WERE SAYING. WE ALSO -- AND CAN I AND COOPERATION OF THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY AND THE GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS AGENCY. COMMITTED TO AN AGILE MODULAR PROCUREMENT ON THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM RATHER THAN DOING OF LARGE. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PAYMENT TO ONE VENDOR AND THEN HAVING THAT TAKE TEN YEARS BEFORE YOU GOT ANY CODE THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY LOOK AT WHAT THAT DOES IS IT ALLOWS THE THE END USER IN THAT CASE THE CASE MANAGERS -- OF SOCIAL SERVICES AGENCY. ACTUALLY ENGAGE WITH THE PRODUCT AND GIVE YOU FEEDBACK ON HOW THAT'S WORKING OR NOT WORKING FOR THEIR THEIR JOBS. I'VE SEEN FIRST HAND HOW STATE EMPLOYEES EMBRACE THIS OPPORTUNITY BOTH INSIDE THE OFFICE AND IN THE DEPARTMENTS WHERE THE PROJECTS TAKE PLACE. I'LL TELL YOU THAT AND IN MY DISCUSSIONS WITH ALL THE OTHER INNOVATION OFFICES OR DIGITAL SERVICES OFFICE I'VE TALKED TO THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THE SUCCESS OF THESE MODELS IS DEPENDENT ON ACTIVE EXECUTIVE SPONSORSHIP. IN THIS CASE THE GOVERNOR HIMSELF IS IS INVOLVED IN THAT. KEY GOALS FOR THE OFFICE ARTIST I WISH A CULTURE OF INNOVATION CUSTOMER CENTRIC MINDSET FOCUS ON BUSINESS PROCESS IMPROVEMENT. UTILIZE AGILE IN OPEN APPROACHES TO HOW WE BUILD AND BUY THINGS. TRANSPARENCY AND WHAT WE'RE DOING OPEN DATA. COLLABORATION SHAREABLE IN REUSABLE SOLUTIONS AND KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER. TO THAT END WERE REQUESTED INITIAL START OF RESOURCES OF THIRTY SIX POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS. FOURTEEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS ONGOING FIFTY POSITIONS TO ESTABLISH THE OFFICE WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY. THE OFFICE WILL HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DEVELOP AND ENFORCE REQUIREMENTS BUT APARTMENTS TO ASSESS THEIR SERVICE DELIVERY MODELS. AND UNDERLYING BUSINESS PROCESSES FROM A CUSTOMER OR END USER PERSPECTIVE. KEEP UP COMPONENTS OF THE PROPOSAL INCLUDE AND INNOVATION ACADEMY. THE SUSTAINABLE INNOVATION REQUIRES A CULTURE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT. AND I THOUGHT. YOU MEANT CHANGE MANAGEMENT. THESE ARE TWO AREAS THE GOVERNMENT HAS HAS NOT TEMPTER PLAY WELL AND AND THAT'S JUST. BROADLY BUT CALIFORNIA IS NOT AN EXCEPTION TO THAT. THE OFFICE WILL ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS CREATION OF A SCALABLE INNOVATION ACADEMY STOCK CONTINUOUS PROCESS IMPROVEMENT EVEN CHANGE MANAGEMENT EXECUTIVE SPONSORSHIP. AND A CUSTOMER CENTRIC MINDSET. ACADEMY WILL BE MANDATORY FOR STATE SUPERVISORS MANAGERS AND EXECUTIVES. WITH THE BREAK DOWN THE LINE TO THE AUDIENCE THAT'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN ORDER FOR ANY OF THESE THINGS TO TAKE ROOT YOU NEED EXECTIVE SPONSORSHIP NEED THE MANAGEMENT THE ACTION UNDERSTAND WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED. WHITE OFTEN THAT THE STAFF ALREADY UNDERSTAND THESE THESE CONCEPTS. AND THEY NEED THE SUPPORT ACTUALLY START TO THEM. WILL ALSO -- INCLUDING HERE'S ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TRAINING. OUR STATE STAFF AN AGILE AND OTHER MODERN MODERN DEVELOPMENT METHODS. TO IMPROVE SUCCESSFUL SERVICE DELIVERY WITH A FOCUS ON CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT. SO AS I SAID WE HAVE IT WITH THE CHILD WELFARE DIGITAL SERVICE SAYS -- WITH THAT RETIREMENT YOU'VE ALREADY BEGUN INVESTING A MODULAR THURMOND NIGEL METHOD OF DELIVERY -- WHEN IMPLEMENTED CORRECTLY? THOSE AND REDUCE THE RISK OF PROJECT FAILURES. AND I THINK EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY ENGAGE THE END USER SO THAT WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT THE END OF SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY USABLE FOR FOR THE PEOPLE THAT THE NEED TO USE THE SYSTEM. THE STATE'S CURRENT PROJECT MANAGERS GENERALLY DON'T HAVE THAT EXPERTISE AND IN MANAGING THIS THIS NEW WAY OF DOING. PARTICULAR AN AGILE DEVELOPMENT. AND THEN THE PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDES AN INNOVATION. SO IT'S A ONE TIME FUNDING A TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO ALLOW THE OFFENSE TO ASSIST DEPARTMENTS BUT WILSON RESOURCES NECESSARY TO ADDRESS. THAT NEED. TO INTENDED TO ALLOW THE OFFICE TO MOVE QUICKLY TO ADDRESS ISSUES AND PROVIDE SOLUTIONS IN REAL TIME. IT'S A SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANT CHANGE FROM EXISTING BUDGET AND I. T. PROJECT WE WILL PROCESS SEES WHICH HAD YEARS TO TIME LINES LEAVE THE LARGE PROJECT PROPOSALS AND FORCED BY ONLY RISKY AND A LARGE SCALE SYSTEM APPLICATION. I KNOW IT'S THE IT'S IT'S GONNA BE IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND HOW THAT ON BEING YOU SINCE THAT PART OF WHAT WE'RE DOING FOR THAT THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE -- WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT OVERLAP BETWEEN EXISTING OFFICES AND WHAT THIS OFFICE WOULD USE OF BRENT SPENCE. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES -- THAT THAT HAS NOW BEEN OFF BEST. THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY HAS A IN AN ODI AS WELL WE'RE GONNA REMAIN NOT SO THAT WE CAN GET RID OF THE FUSION THERE. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO THAT THESE ARE COMPLEMENTARY ROLES THIS IS NOT. SAME THINGS IN FACT CD TEASE FOCUS MORE ON ON THE THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY STAFF. THIS IS FOCUSED MORE ON THE EXECUTIVE SPONSORSHIP. THE MANAGEMENT STAFF WROTE THE PROGRAM STAFF. THIS IS NOT REALLY ABOUT IT ON THIS SIDE. AND SO WE THINK THAT THOSE ARE GOING TO BE COMPLIMENTARY COMPLEMENTARY ROLES RATHER THAN. INNER OVERLAP. SO -- THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION PUZZLE AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS OKAY -- YOU WANT. YES -- I'M SORRY YES -- BRIAN MASSACRE ALEJO -- WE WROTE A BUDGET AND POLICY POST ON THIS PARTICULAR GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- WORRY RAISED SEVERAL ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION ALL TO SUMMARIZE THEM THE THREE MAIN AREAS. THE FIRST OF WHICH IS THE LEGISLATURE'S ROLE RELATIVE TO THIS NEW OFFICE I'M PARTICULARLY IN THE CRITERIA USED TO SELECT THOSE PROJECTS THAT ARE GONNA BE FUNDED WITH THE INNOVATION FUND MONIES -- IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING FROM THE ADMINISTRATION SOME OF THOSE CRITERIA WILL INCLUDE THINGS SUCH AS THE POLICY INTERESTS OF THE ADMINISTRATION -- FEEDBACK FROM MANAGERS AND EXECUTIVES THAT ATTEND THIS NEW INNOVATION ACADEMY AS WELL AS A DEPARTMENTS READING THIS ACTUALLY ENGAGE THE NEW OFFICE IN THESE PROPOSALS AND SO. THERE'S NOT A CLEAR ROLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE IN DEFINING WHAT -- ITS INTERESTS ARE IN SELECTING THE DEPARTMENTS -- THERE'S ALSO THE ISSUE OF OVERSIGHT -- AS THAT -- AS WAS MENTIONED -- RELATED TO THE CURRENT -- BUDGET PROCESS RELATIVE TO THIS TWENTY MILLION IN A ONE TIME APPROPRIATION THAT'S CURRENTLY THROUGH THEIR BUDGET BILLING WHICH ON SUBJECT ANY STRINGS ATTACHED -- AT THIS TIME ON THE SECOND ISSUE IS AROUND THIS ISSUE OF DEFINING CD T. ARMOR TECHNOLOGY RELATIVE TO THE NEW OFFICE -- WHILE WE APPRECIATE THAT THE RULES MAY BE COMPLEMENTARY TO THE EXTENT THAT pFUNDING AND POSITIONS IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION -- INTENDS TO ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY TO MAINTAIN THE FUNDING IN POSITIONS THAT IT DOES HAVE -- RATHER THAN REVERTING THE SAVINGS BACK TO THE STATE SO IT IS IMPORTANT WE BELIEVE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER WHETHER THAT'S APPROPRIATE -- DECISION TO BE MADE AND THE LAST. PIECE OF THIS IS WHETHER THE ACTUAL PROPOSED AND LEVEL OF FUNDING IN POSITIONS -- IS IS REALISTIC OR OR COULD BE ACHIEVED GIVEN THAT WE HAD DIFFICULTY IN THE PAST HIRING IT -- WE APPRECIATE THAT NOT ALL THE STAFF WILL BE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN I. T. -- BUT THERE MAY BE DIFFICULTY RAMPING UP IN ONE YEAR I'M FIFTY POSITIONS FOR THIS NEW OFFICE AND SO -- DEFINING THAT UP FRONT AS WELL AS LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE WHAT THE ON GOING FUNDING POSITIONS WILL BE DIFFERENT KIND OF THE MISSION OF THIS NEW OFFICE THANK YOU. DID YOU HAVE. YES A DEPARTMENT OF THAT ROUND ROBIN FINANCE WE SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL'S BUDGETED -- AND WE WE DO HAVE SOME PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE THAT SPECIFIES THAT THE IN AT ONE TIME INNOVATION FUNDING SHALL BE USED TO ASSIST DEPARTMENTS AND THEIR INNOVATION ACTIVITIES WE DON'T FIND WHAT INNOVATION ACTIVITIES ARE BUT THERE IS SOME LANGUAGE. IN THE BUDGET BILL THAT THAT. A SPECIFIES WHAT THAT FUNDING WILL BE USED [inaudible] FOR OKAY. YES I WOULD DO ON A SH WELL YOU WILL RESPOND TO THOSE QUESTIONS ARE -- SO ON ON THE LEGISLATURE'S ROLE AND WE'RE WE'RE ALWAYS OPEN TO IDEAS THAT THEIR THINGS THE LEGISLATURE PARTICULARLY WANTS TO HAVE LOOKED AT I DON'T THINK THAT WE WOULD BE OPPOSED TO TO LOOK INTO -- CURRENTLY AT THAT THE HHS ANIMATION OFFICE THE IDEAS. THE PROJECTS COME FROM THE DEPARTMENTS THEMSELVES. AND SO -- THERE MAY BE INSTANCES WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO SAY THAT THIS IS A PRIORITY IN THE OFFICE IS GOING TO LOOK INTO IT. BUT IN A LOT OF CASES I WOULD WANT THOSE COMING OUT FROM THE DEPARTMENT'S INSTEAD SAID THERE'S BY AND FROM THE DEPARTMENT. IS IS VERY IMPORTANT IN THIS TYPE OF PROJECT THAT YOU HAVE. A PAIRING OF THE DEPARTMENTAL STAFF WHO UNDERSTAND THE PROGRAM THE PROBLEMS THAT THEY'RE HAVING. ALONG WITH THE EXPERT IN THE IN THE NEW APPROACHES. AND THEN IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT FOR THE LONGER TERM THAT THE DEPARTMENT BUYS INTO IT SO THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT THE SOLUTION. RATHER THAN SOMEBODY COME AND TELL YOU THIS IS WHAT YOU SHOULD DO WALK AWAY AND THEN YOU SAY WELL WE'RE DONE WITH THAT WE'RE GOING BACK TO THE WAY THAT. WE'VE DONE IT ASI SAID THIS IS REALLY ABOUT CULTURAL CHANGE. SO THE PROJECT REALLY INCREMENTALLY THE LEAD TO EIGHT SHIFT IN THE THE CULTURE OF THE DEPARTMENTS. THE ONE THAT'S FOCUSED ON INNOVATION FOCUSED ON DIFFERENT WAYS OF APPROACHING PROBLEMS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY FOCUSED ON THEIR END USERS -- AS FAR AS THE SAVINGS I I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE ARE SAVINGS AT THE MOMENT I I'M NOT SEEING A LOT OF OVERLAP BETWEEN. THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY AND THE PROPOSED OFFICE SO WE WE DON'T SEE THAT THERE ARE SAVINGS THERE COULD BE SOME. COULD BE SCORED -- WERE OPEN TO THAT CONVERSATION OF PEOPLE SEE MORE OVERLAP AND I'M SAYING I I'M OPEN OF THE CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT THAT OVERLAP LOOKS LIKE. AND AS FAR AS HIRING HIRING IS DIFFICULT AND AND WE'RE GOING TO HIRE GOOD PEOPLE INTO THESE POSITIONS. THEY'RE NOT REALLY -- GONNA BE THERE MAY BE SOME MIGHTY PEOPLE BUT A LOT OF THEM ARE NOT GOING TO BE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. POSITIONS BECAUSE A LOT OF THE STUFF THAT WE'RE DOING -- AT HHS SOMEWHAT INVISION. THEM DURING THE OFF THE DIGITAL INNOVATION IS REALLY AROUND PROCESS IMPROVEMENT. AND DIFFERENT WAYS OF APPROACHING APPROACHING PROBLEMS SOME OF IT MAY HAVE AN IT COMPONENT TO IT BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AN I. T. DRIP AND PROCESS [inaudible] OKAY -- THANK YOU SECTOR WILL MEAN. TO THE POINT YOU MADE ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY SO. A YEAR FROM NOW HOW DO WE FIGURE OUT WHETHER THIS BEEN IS BEEN AN EFFECTIVE USE OF TAXPAYER MONEY WHAT WHAT METRICS ARE WE GONNA USED TO JUDGE WHETHER THIS IS SUCCESSFUL OR NOT [inaudible] SO. A YEAR FROM NOW AND THE FIRST STEP IS GOING TO BE GETTING A DIRECTOR FOR FOR THE OFFICE AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO A WIDE SEARCH FOR THAT AND IT'S A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO I THINK ARE IN THAT. WILL THAT THEY WOULD REALLY WANT IS THAT REALLY HIGH CALIBER INDIVIDUAL WHO IS ABLE TO DELIVER ON THAT SO I AM LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY WHO CAN HIT THE GROUND RUNNING. AND THAT WILL GIVE ME AN IDEA OF WHAT I CAN ACTUALLY DELIVER WITHIN A YEAR. WHAT I WOULD WANT IS THAT WE WE HAVE THE TRAINING CURRICULUM UP AND WE'RE STARTING TO TRAIN UP EXECUTIVES THAT WE CAN COME BACK TO YOU AND SAY HERE'S HERE'S WHAT THE TRAINING PROGRAM LOOKS LIKE HERE'S HOW MANY PEOPLE WE TRAINED? HERE THE THINGS WERE STARTING TO SEE OUT OF THAT AND SOME OF THE THE THINGS THAT WE'RE CHANGING BASED ON THE FEEDBACK THEY WERE GETTING. SO I THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT THAT THIS OFFICE LIVES BY WHAT IT'S ALSO MOUSING WHICH IS THAT. WE CHANGE AS WE LEARN WE CONTINUE TO TALK TO THE PEOPLE WE CONTINUE TO GET FEEDBACK AND THEN WE SHIFT AS WE NEED TO TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE END USER -- I ALSO THINK THAT. YOU KNOW ITIS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT WILL HAVE SOME PROJECTS DONE WITHIN A YEAR -- BECAUSE WE CAN GET SOME SMALLER PROJECTS AND PROBABLY BRING THOSE UP WE CAN SCALE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING ITS C. HHS AND START TO SCALE -- OUT TO THE THE BROADER STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS. AND SO I THINK WE'LL WE'LL BE ABLE TO COME BACK WITH SOME ACTUAL SUCCESSES AND SAY HERE'S WHAT WE'VE DONE TO IMPROVE THE WAY THAT WERE APPROACHING PROBLEMS. HERE'S WHAT WE'VE DONE TO IMPROVE DATA SHARING ACROSS DEPARTMENTS HERE'S WHAT WE'VE DONE TO GET A BETTER VIEW OF WHAT SERVICES ARE PROVIDING TO INDIVIDUALS AND WHAT. IT BACK IS ON WHAT THAT SERVICE LOOKS LIKE. WE SHOULD ALSO WITHIN A YEAR HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT THE FUTURE OF THE OFFICE REALLY IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE. SO I THINK WITHIN THAT YEAR WE NEED TO BE FIGURING OUT WHERE WE GOING TO FOCUS. AND START MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION AND SO. YEAH IT IT'S NOT GONNA BE NOW WE'RE STARTING WITHOUT STAFF AT THE MOMENT SO I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU THERE'S GOING TO BE A HUGE DELIVERABLE. THAT WE PUT IN FRONT OF YOU AT THE END OF A YOU KNOW A YEAR FROM NOW. BUT I DO EXPECT THAT THEY'LL BE SOME SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS. IN MOVING TOWARDS MOVING THE CULTURE OF OF THE STATE AGENCIES AT LEAST AND POCKETS. AND THEN I THINK THAT THAT'S SCALABLE OUT OVER THE COMING YEARS. THE CONCERN IS IS THAT WHEN WE CREATE A NEW GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION WITHOUT A DEFINED SORT OF PRODUCT. IN STATE. THAT THAT ORGANIZATION EXISTS. JUST TO EXIST THE YEARS THAT WHAT I MEAN BY THAT THAT IT'S JUST SELF PERPETUATING. SO WHETHER IT'S A YEAR TWO YEARS FROM NOW YOU EXPECT THAT THAT THEY'LL BE ACTUAL PRODUCT THAT WE PRODUCE THAT WE CAN SAY WE HAVE NOW. EITHER CREATED WE LANDED A MAN ON THE MOON OR WOMAN ON THE MOON OR WE'VE DONE SOMETHING. THAT IMPROVES THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIA IN SOME FASHION IS. A CAB SO THAT'S A WE SHOULD LOOK FOR YOU TO LOOK FOR THOSE THINGS WE SHOULD A YEAR EARLIER. I MEAN SOME WEBSITES SO THAT THERE'S BETTER ACCESS IS BETTER UNDERSTANDING. LOOKING AT HOW PEOPLE APPLY FOR EVERY DIFFERENT BENEFITS. HOW WE MONITOR WHAT BENEFITS ARE BEING USED SO SORTS OF THINGS SHOULD BE DONE I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT METRICS SO TO THE POINT YOU JUST MADE? YOU KNOW HOW MANY YOU KNOW MORE HITS DO WE WHAT A MAKING THINGS UP NOW BUT HOW MANY MORE HIS DO WE HAVE HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE OF WE PROVIDED SERVICE. HOW MUCH MONEY HAVE WE SAVE HOW MUCH QUICKER HAVE WE DONE SOMETHING? SO THAT. WE WE CAN ACTUALLY TO THE POINT ABOUT. ACCOUNTABILITY OF LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHTS WE CAN SAY HEY WE WE SPENT THIS MONEY AND HERE'S WHAT WE'VE DELIVERED. FOR CALIFORNIA -- LASTLY I'M BACK NEW GOVERNMENT AGAIN -- BUT I NOTICE YOU DIDN'T USE THE WORD SYNERGY INTERFACE DIALOGUE YOU DO USE LEVERAGING SO. IS I'VE NOTICED THAT UNLESS SOMEBODY USES THOSE THREE TERMS SYNERGY INTERFACE AND DIALOGUE THAT IT MAY NOT BE A VIABLE PROGRAM CELL -- WILL HAVE TO WORK ON ALL RIGHT OKAY. THANK YOU [inaudible] SEVEN OKAY -- I HAVE TO ADMIT I'M I'M STILL. SOMEWHAT NOT CONFUSE BUT IT SEEMS SO GENERAL AND SO VAGUE AND I AM I REALLY APPRECIATE. THE WAY THAT YOU'VE LAID OUT. THE THE BROAD BROAD GOALS OF CHANGING CULTURE IMPROVING CIVIC ENGAGEMENT RISK TAKING. I GET THAT AND I'M ALL FOR THAT. BUT I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHAT IT WHAT WHAT THAT MEANS REALLY? TRANSLATING THAT INTO REAL THINGS FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA -- SO SO IT JUST AND THEN THE THE SECOND PART IS THAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED. AT LEAST WITHIN YOUR PREVIOUS DEPARTMENT. RIGHT AND MAYBE A FEW OTHER EXAMPLES OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING OR WHAT HAS BEEN DONE. AND THERE. TO THIS POINT SUCCESSFUL EXAMPLES OF WHAT CAN BE DONE. SO WHY IS A NEW. WHOLE NEW DEPARTMENT WITH FIFTY MORE PEOPLE AND THIS MONEY WHY IS THAT NEEDED IF. THROUGH YOUR OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE HERE. YOU SEE YOU'VE SEEN WHAT CAN BE DONE IN THE DEPARTMENTS. IT IS NOT AS YOU SAID IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE UNLESS THERE IS BY AND BY PEOPLE ON THE GROUND TO HAVE THE PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE OF WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT'S NOT WHAT. WHAT'S GOOD AND WHAT IS AN WOULD STILL BE LEFT OUT. SO. I STILL DON'T GET WHERE. SOMETHING IS GONNA NEED LEAD TO THE ON SOMETHING BETTER. THAT WE NEED A GOVERNMENT RIGHT AND AND THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION -- I THINK THAT ONE OF THE ONE OF THE POINTS IS THAT TO REALLY DO THIS STATEWIDE YOU NEED A CENTRAL ORGANIZATION THAT'S ABLE TO DO IT. AND AND APPROPRIATELY RESOURCE SO WHAT WE WE DID IT HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AS WE'VE KIND OF COBBLED IT TOGETHER AND IT'S DOING SINCE SOME INTERESTING WORK AND AND SOME IMPACTFUL WORK FOR INSTANCE WE WE LOOKED AT WOMEN INFANTS AND CHILDREN PROGRAM AND CAL BRASH. AND LOOKING TO SEE WHAT THE OVERLAP WAS -- IN THOSE PROGRAMS. AT THE CENSUS TRACK LEVEL SO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHICH COUNTIES ARE DOING A GOOD JOB ENROLLING PEOPLE IN THOSE PROGRAMS. WHICH ONES ARE HAVING SOME STRUGGLES WATER BEST PRACTICES TO HELP THEM BUT ALSO TO GIVE THAT INFORMATION BACK TO COUNTIES AT THE CENSUS TRACK LEVEL. SO THAT THEY CAN THEN DO TARGETED AND OUTRAGE RATHER THAN A GENERAL APPROACH TO THEIR CAL FRESH PROGRAM. THEY CAN INSTEAD TARGET. PARTICULAR AREA AND SAY THIS IS MARIE AND GET THE BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK -- WERE ALSO STARTING TO LOOK AT THE THE PROCESS THAT WE USE TO BRING INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL INDIVIDUALS INTO THE STATE HOSPITAL. THERE'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT WAIT LIST FOR YEARS ON IT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN SUED ON MANY TIMES. AND THAT WE BUT A LOT OF RESEARCH THE LEGISLATURE ON THE THE ADMINISTRATION PUT A LOT OF RESOURCES AND TO INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF BEDS THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN THE STATE HOSPITALS AND OTHER WAYS TO ADDRESS THAT. BUT NOW WORD THROUGH THAT OFFICE LOOKING AT THE PROCESS ITSELF. HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT MOVING THAT THROUGH DAY THE COUNTIES AND THROUGH THE STATE AND ARE THERE WAYS TO TRUNCATE? THAT PROCESS TO GET THE WAIT TIME DOWN [inaudible] SO. THERE'S THERE'S A LIMIT TO WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH THE RE DIRECTED RESOURCES AND IT'S ALL INTERNAL STAFF AT THE MOMENT. SO ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES THAT I SEE WITH THIS OFFICE IS THAT IT'S A PARTNERING WITH WITH EXTERNAL WITH PRIVATE SECTOR -- THE US DIGITAL SERVICES BRINGS AND PEOPLE FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR ON TO OUR FOUR YEAR STANDS -- THAN A MAN. THEY THEY DO GOVERNMENT SERVICE THEY BRING IN SOME IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO IMPROVE HOW IT OPERATES WORK ON PARTICULAR PROJECTS THAN THEY GO BACK TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR. I THINK LIKEWISE THIS OFFICE NEEDS TO HAVE THAT THAT ABILITY AND THAT'S PART OF WHAT FUNDING ALLOWS YOU TO DO. WHICH WERE NOT ABLE TO DO IT HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES -- IT'S ALSO A MUCH BROADER REACH SO. YOU KNOW HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES IS THE LARGEST AGENCY IN THE STATE THERE'S THERE'S RESOURCES AVAILABLE THAT I WAS ABLE TO TO RE DIRECT. FOR AS SMALL OFFICE -- BUT THAT'S THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE AND ALL AGENCIES ARE ALL DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND SO THIS OFFICE ALLOWS FOR THE ONES THAT CAN'T DO THAT SORT OF THING TO ACTUALLY HAVE. NOW THE ABILITY TO TO DO THIS TYPE OF WORK. HAVING IT AT GOVERNOR GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS ALLOWS IT TO BE IN A PLACE WHERE IT CENTRAL. WHERE IT ALSO HAS THE AUTHORITY TO PUSH THIS? SO FRIENDS AT HHS. I WAS ABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE I I WAS SECRETARY OF THE AGENCY AND I HAD PARTICULAR DEPARTMENTS AND THERE WAS BY AND OVER ABOUT A FOUR YEAR PERIOD. AND HOW THIS WORK. I THINK THIS HAS TO BE SCALED UP FASTER THAN THAT. THAT WAS A A PROCESS THAT WE WENT THROUGH THAT WAS REALLY A PROTOTYPING PROCESS OF HOW. TO LEARNED A LOT OF LESSONS IN THE FOUR YEARS AND WILL APPLY THOSE AS WE START TO BRING THIS OFFICE OUT. YOU REFERRED TO TO DO THIS. UP AND YOU KNOW AS AS YOU SPOKE. AT IT IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT YOU MEAN BY TO DO THIS -- AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES LIKE RIGHT AND THAT AND THAT'S WHY WITH STIRRED MIGHT QUESTION WHICH IS. THERE ARE GOOD EXAMPLES -- AND IS THIS AN ATTEMPT TO COME IN AND SAY WE'RE GOING TO DO IT ACROSS THE BOARD IN EVERY SINGLE DEPARTMENT. QUESTION IS WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO AND I THINK TO SENATOR UMBERG'S QUESTION IS. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO IN ALL THE DEPARTMENTS ARE YOU GOING TO BE IN A POSITION TO SAY YES. THIS IS THE DECISION OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO I I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE THIS IS. THAT'S EXPECTED AND ARE YOU GOING TO MANDATE SOMETHING. THROUGHOUT ALL OF THIS AGENCIES AND ALL THE DEPARTMENTS IT'S IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT YOU'RE GONNA MANDATE TO THEIR SO THERE ARE A COUPLE THINGS WERE WE'RE GOING TO MANDATE THE TRAINING SO THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE AT THE THE SENIOR LEVELS THAT UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS. ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE. SO THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THE THE APPROACHES. SO THAT THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT'S POSSIBLE SO THAT'S THAT'S THE FIRST MANDATE THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. I THINK THE ONE COMMONALITY THAT WILL BE THERE THROUGH ALL OF THE PROJECTS. IS A FOCUS ON THE END USER WHETHER THAT STATE STAFF IN SOME INSTANCES WHETHER IT MY ANSWER RECEIVING SERVICES. WHETHER IT'S THE GENERAL PUBLIC -- THE TRYING TO REGISTER CARS OR WHATEVER THEY'RE TRYING TO DO -- THERE'S GOING TO BE A FOCUS ON THE END USER WHICH ISN'T THERE AND IN MOST AREAS OF STATE GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOW AND HONESTLY IN MOST AREAS OF GOVERNMENT -- THE ACTUAL PROJECTS THEMSELVES. IS GOING TO BE DEPENDENT ON WHAT THE NEEDS ARE SO IT COULD BE SOMETHING LIKE TAKING DATA FROM. BROWN'S MATCHING IT UP FIGURE OUT OVERLAPS AND HOW DO YOU PUSH. THE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE PROGRAMS -- AND THAT'S GONNA THAT -- WICK CAL FRESH EXAMPLE IT CAN BE PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS SO YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU GO THROUGH AT AN APPROVAL PROCESS. OR AT A PARTICULAR ISSUE AND THAT CAN GO ACROSS MULTIPLE LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT THAT CAN GO ACROSS THE COUNTY AND STATE. GET IN THERE AND ACTUALLY START TO TO TEAR IT APART AND WHAT'S WHAT'S NEEDED SO FOR INSTANCE WE PARTNERED UP WITH RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES TO STREAMLINE ACCESS TO DATA. SO BEFORE WE DID THIS THERE WERE MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS FOR HHS. INSTEAD NOW THERE'S A COMMON APPLICATION WE WENT THROUGH AND SAID WHAT DO WE ACTUALLY NEED TO BE ASKING. FOR AND IF IF WE HAVE THINGS THAT AREN'T STATUTORILY REQUIRED WHY ARE WE DOING THAT. TO JUST PULL IT OUT WHAT ARE THE COMMONALITIES SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO ACROSS. MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS ANYHOW ONE ACCESS POINT. SO THOSE ARE THINGS LIKE THAT WEBSITE REDESIGNS -- YEAH THE WEBSITES OF THE MOST STATE DEPARTMENTS ARE FAIRLY DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE -- QUITE OFTEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT ASA MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC YOU REALLY WANT WHEN YOU LOOK AT A WEBSITE. INSTEAD YOU YOU HAVE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT YOU HAVE BIO'S OF THE DIRECTOR. THINGS LIKE THAT THAT YOU KNOW IT IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT FROM A PRIVATE CITIZEN VIEWPOINT YOU REALLY DON'T CARE. YOU REALLY JUST YOU WANT. ACCESS TO A PARTICULAR SERVICE YOU WANT SOMETHING DONE AND THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON AND START TO SHIFT. HOW WE WE INTERACT WITH THE GENERAL PUBLIC? JUST ONE MORE QUESTION -- YOU MENTIONED THIS BUT YOU CAN. GET INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE. THIS COMPLEMENTARY WITH DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY I MEAN WE ALREADY HAVE. THE TECHNOLOGY DEPARTMENT. HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT? AND WHY DO WE HAVE TO HAVE TWO DIFFERENT -- THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY IS IS REALLY FOCUSED ON TECHNOLOGY THIS THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY FOCUSED ON TECHNOLOGY I GUESS A LOT OF IT PROCESS IMPROVEMENT A LOT OF ITS FOCUSING ON END USERS. AND CHANGING THE WAY THAT WE VIEW OUR SOLUTIONS. NOW THE SOLUTION MAY HAVE SOME IT COMPONENT TO IT BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT THE THE I. T. -- THE TRAINING IS FOCUSED ON EXECUTIVES AND ON PROGRAM STAFF NOT ON THE IT. COMMUNITY. THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY FOCUSES ON THE I. T. COMMUNITY SO THEY PROVIDE TRAINING FOR FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOLKS. THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR COMMON PLATFORM SO -- FOR INSTANCE WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE THE MACRO -- WEB PAGE FOR THE STATE OR YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT -- SOMETHING LIKE A MACRO PAYMENT. STANDARD FOR THE STATE. THAT'S BEEN IMPLEMENTED BY AN I. T. PROJECT. THOSE ARE THINGS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY DOES NOW WILL CONTINUE TO DO -- OVERSIGHT OF LARGE IT PROJECTS IS IN THE PURVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY THIS OFFICE WOULD NOT BE INVOLVED IN IN LARGE IT PROCUREMENTS. SEVEN WHEN IT WHEN YOU'RE DONE. YEAH -- QUESTION -- AND THESE THE GOING BACK TO THE ISSUE OF THE FIFTY POSITIONS -- ONE QUESTION WAS HOW WE HOW DO YOU EXPECT HIGHER THAT MANY BUT HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH. FIFTY POSITIONS THAT THAT WOULD BE. THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF STAFF. IT WAS JUST THE INITIAL ESTIMATE YOU KNOW IT WE WENT THROUGH AND LOOKED AT THE ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF THAT WE WOULD NEED TO RUN AN OFFICE LIKE THIS. AND THEN WE STARTED LOOKING AT THE TYPES OF FUNCTIONS FUNCTIONAL STAFF THAT WE WOULD NEED BUILT IN THE DIFFERENT AREAS. AND WE WOULD NEED MULTIPLE PROJECTS GOING AT THE SAME TIME SO THAT'S NO IT'S NOT. IF YOU HAVE YOUR STAFF YOU DO FOR YOUR PROJECTS IF YOU HAVE MORE STAFF YOU DO MORE PROJECT. AND IF. WHAT WE SEEN WITH THESE OFFICES IN OTHER AREAS IS THAT THEY SCALE OUT? SO THEY START OUT AT A CERTAIN LEVEL AND THEY THEY GENERALLY GROW PRETTY QUICKLY AS MORE DEPARTMENTS. WANT TO HAVE THE THE SERVICES THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING THE INSIGHTS OF THEIR PROVIDING. AS THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE EITHER IF IT'S A STATE THE LEGISLATURE OR THE US CONGRESS. AS THEY HAVE THEIR EXPECTATIONS ABOUT WHAT THOSE INTERACTION SHOULD LOOK LIKE AND WHAT THE VARIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS THINK SHOULD BE DONE [inaudible] PUBLIC. THE NUMBER SO NOT NOT TO BELABOR THIS BUT I SHARE SOME OF YOUR CONCERNS -- SENATOR ALSO. HOW LONG DO YOU THINK THIS OFFICE NEED BE IN EXISTENCE? I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE THE END DATE FOR THE THE OFFICE SAYS WHAT I DO SEE IS THAT AS A AS THE TRAINING CONTINUES. THAT THE THEY'RE GONNA BE MORE EXECUTIVES AND MORE SUPERVISORS THAT UNDERSTAND THE APPROACHES -- AS A FEW MORE PROJECTS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DEPARTMENTS THEY'RE GOING TO BE MORE PEOPLE THAT UNDERSTAND HOW TO DO THESE TYPES OF THINGS. AND SO I THINK THAT THE THE TYPE OF WORK THAT THE OFFICE IS DOING IS GOING TO SHIFT. AS AS YOU DO THAT SO SOME OF THE EASIER STUFF THAT ILL ENGAGE IN AT THE BEGINNING. WILL BE TAKEN OVER BY DEPARTMENTS AS THEY GET THE SKILL SETS TO TO DO THAT ON THEIR OWN AND THEN THE MORE DIFFICULT PROJECTS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO COME INTO THE OFFICE. SO I'M NOT SEEING A PARTICULAR AND DAVE BUT I AM SAYING THAT THE THE MISSION. ALL THE TYPES OF PROJECTS TO MISSIONAL SAYS SOME OF THE TYPES OF PROJECTS. WILL CHANGE OVER TIME SO. INSTRUCTOR WILL MEAN YOU YOU HAVE A VISION AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT VISION IS IT'S KINDA LIKE JELLO RIGHT NOW FOR ME -- AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT. YOU CAN YOU AT SOME POINT IN TIME. YOU DO IN THE NEXT YEAR HAVE A GOAL TO WORK YOURSELF OUT OF EXISTENCE I'M IN THE OFFICE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION. WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT THAT TO THE EXTENT YOU WANT TO CREATE A CULTURAL CHANGE AT SOME POINT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO CREATE THE CULTURAL CHANGES LIKE THE OFFICE OF GOOD GOVERNMENT IT SHOULD BE I WOULD THINK THAT EVERY ENTITY EVERY AGENCY WOULD WANT. TO ENGAGE IN DIGITAL INNOVATION AND THAT. THAT WOULD. MEAN THAT AT SOME POINT. EVERYBODY'S DOING IT AND SO YOU THIS OFFICE WOULD NOT NEED TO EXIST IS THAT. AM I WRONG ABOUT THAT. I THINK THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN AND AND THE REASON I SAY THAT IS THAT EXPECTATIONS ALSO CHANGE OVER TIME. AND SO TEN YEARS FROM NOW WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS GOOD TODAY MAY NOT BE OKAY. IN A DECADE -- SO THAT'S THAT'S REALLY I I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ESPECIALLY THE TRAIN UP THE WORK FORCE AS YOU GET MORE PEOPLE THAT UNDERSTAND THAT. THE THAT'S WHY I SAY THE THE PROJECT TYPES I THINK SHIFT. AND THAT THE MORE COMPLEX THINGS CONTINUE TO TO COME TO THIS OFFICE AND THE EASIER THINGS. ARE JUST TAKING CARE OF BY THE THE PEOPLE THAT NOW BOUGHT INTO THE APPROACH IS WHAT WILL BE ANXIOUS TO SEE. WHAT WHAT PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED WHAT METRICS ARE PROVIDED? ALL ALL ALL THOSE THINGS -- ONE LAST SUGGESTION IS THAT TO YOUR POINT ABOUT. BEING USER CENTRIC. AND I'VE ASKED THIS QUESTION OF OTHERS IS THAT THAT WHOEVER IS IN CHARGE OF THAT PARTICULAR ASPECT THAT THEY ACTUALLY USE THE SYSTEM. SO. IF IT'S DMV THAT SOMEBODY ACTUALLY TRIES TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT WITH DMV. I'VE TRIED TO DO THAT VERY HARD -- LOT OF ARE INTO YOUR POINT LOT OF OUR POINTS OF ACCESS FOR CONSUMERS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE THE ONE EXCEPTION THAT IS. PAYING YOUR TAXES YOU CAN DO THAT RELATIVELY EASILY. BUT IF YOU WANT TO FOR EXAMPLE MAKE APPOINTMENT DMV KIND OF SO JUST JUST A SUGGESTION BECAUSE NEXT YEAR WILL ASK OR BY THE WAY DID YOU. ACTUALLY USE WHATEVER. AND SYSTEM YOU'VE CREATED A GOOD SUGGESTION. NO I AND I WOULD JUST BE PETE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I STILL NEED. IS THE THE COLLABORATION OR THE YOU MENTIONED THIS IS AS OPEN THAT'S WHAT THE LEGISLATURE BUT I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE A LOT CLEARER -- TO GIVE US THE THE COMFORT LEVEL -- I THINK STILL THE QUESTION OF YOUR COORDINATION OR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE IT. DEPARTMENT IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND HOW THIS IS SUPPOSED TO DO. PRODUCE SOMETHING BETTER FOR A FOR THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA. TWO YEARS. WE NEED MORE OF THAT BUT I GREATLY APPRECIATE THAT. WE'RE LOOKING WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO LOOK OUT OF THE BOX HERE THAT WE'RE NOT STUCK IN ONE PLACE. I THINK IT'S JUST A MATTER OF IF THAT'S THE CASE AND MAYBE WE DON'T NEED. PEOPLE IN ANOTHER DEPARTMENT WHO COULD MOVE INTO THIS DEPARTMENT OR YOU KNOW I MEAN I THINK THERE'S ALSO A QUESTION OF EFFICIENCY RATHER THAN JUST. HIS FIFTY MORE PEOPLE AND LET'S GO OUT AND DO WHATEVER WE CAN SO. I GREATLY APPRECIATE -- THE IDEAS THAT YOU PRESENTED AND WHAT YOU WANT TO COMPETITION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU -- PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE ON THIS. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND SENATOR ROBB GROWS CLOSER WITH AMAZON WEB SERVICES -- SECRETARY WILKENING USE THE TERM AND USER AND FOR OUR CULTURE THAT MEANS THE CUSTOMER AMAZON IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST CUSTOMER FOCUSED CUSTOMER OBSESSED COMPANIES IT AROUND. AND WE VIEW THIS PROPOSAL THROUGH THAT LANDS THAT THIS IS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE MINISTRATIONS INCREASING THAT COMMITMENT TO CUSTOMERS. I THINK THAT THERE'S DEFINITELY A GAP WHEN IT COMES TO CUSTOMERS INTERACTING WITH GOVERNMENT. AND TO HAVE AN OFFICE LIKE THIS THAT HAVE THE EXPERTISE AND THAT ADDITIONAL LAYER TO ASSIST WITH THAT WOULD GREATLY GO FORWARD IN PROVIDING THE SERVICES TO OUR CITIZENS AND SO IT'S WITH THAT LENS THAT WE SUPPORT. THIS ITEM AND ALSO GIVEN SECRETARY LOOKING AND IS THE POST THANK YOU THANK YOU. RENTER CENTER MY NAME'S PETER KELLY I'M. PRIVATE CITIZEN BUT I USED TO WORK IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THIS SPACE. AND I'D LIKE TO MAKE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS. GOVERNMENT HAS TWO MODELS FOR HOW IT CHANGES. THE FIRST IS TELLING PEOPLE HOW TO DO IT FROM THE OUTSIDE. AND THE SECOND IS SHOWING HOW TO DO IT FROM THE INSIDE IT'S PARTNER. WE HAVE FAR TOO MUCH OF THE FIRST. AND NOT ENOUGH OF A SECOND. THIS PROPOSAL SEEMS TO BE FOCUSING ON THE SECOND. IT LOOKS AT MODELS THE U. K. GOVERNMENT FULL SERVICE AND THE USPS WHICH HAVE SUCCESSFULLY ADOPTED THIS APPROACH. OVER THE LAST FOUR TO SEVEN YEARS. IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE MODELS WHERE IT IS DEFINING HOW DO SOMETHING. IT IS A MODEL THAT'S COMING FROM THE INSIDE AND CHUCKLE HOW DO AS A PARTNER. WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH OF THAT. THIS AGENCY HAS PROVEN LAST COUPLE OF YEARS THAT IT HAS MADE THIS MODEL. AFFECTED WITHIN SIEGES OF ESSAY AND IT SHOULD BE LOOKED OUT ACROSS THE GOVERNMENT. TOP COVER IS REQUIRED TO MAKE THESE SORTS OF CHANGE THE SOMETHING SECRETARY HAS DONE SOMETHING TO GO OFF HAS DONE. BUT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT IT IS SOMETHING IT HAS TO BE CONTINUOUSLY REINFORCED. NOT. CAN NOT FADE AWAY. FOCUSING ON THE CENTER THE SERVICE AT THE CENTER OF GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE A STATE OFFERING PROCEDURE BUT IT IS NOT. IT'S NOT HOW WE OPERATE. I LONG ADVOCATED THAT DEPARTMENT EXECUTIVES USE THE FRONT DOOR FOR EARNED SERVICES CENTER LIKE YOU SAID. BUT THEY GENERALLY DO NOT WHAT I'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS IS THAT. HELPING YOU WITH SERVICE AGENCY DEPARTMENT EXECUTIVES DO THIS NOW MORE THAN EVER HAVE IN THE PAST. GOVERNMENT OFTEN FALLS BACK ON THIS IS THE WAY WE'VE ALWAYS DONE IT. STAFF MEET YOUR REWARD FOR ASKING WHY WE TALK ABOUT TAKE INTELLIGENT RISKS BUT EVEN AS HE RECOGNIZED THIS IS REQUIRED. IT IS NOT DONE WE STILL ACT PUNITIVE LEE WHEN GOVERNOR EXECUTIVES ATTEMPT TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS. THERE IS NO REWARD FOR INTELLIGENT RISK TAKING. TEN YEARS AGO WHEN PEOPLE ASKED ABOUT USING THESE DEVICES PROVIDE CITIZENS SERVICES EVERYONE LAUGHED. THAT WAS TWO YEARS AFTER THE IPHONE WAS RELEASED TODAY WE'RE PLAYING CATCH UP WE'RE NOT PROVIDING THE SERVICES THAT WE NEED. AND WE ARE AT A SIGNIFICANT DISADVANTAGE AS A RESULT. THEY ARE CURRENTLY NOT ON HOW WE SERVE CITIZENS BECAUSE WE DON'T COORDINATE ACROSS DEPARTMENTS IN A WAY THAT WAS THE CITIZEN AT THE CENTER. DEPARTMENTS WANT TO IMPROVE. BUT DAY. IF THEY'RE NOT TOLD THAT THEY CAN MAKE THESE IMPROVEMENTS HAVE A CHALLENGE COR NAY ACROSS AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS BUT SECRETARY AND HIS STAFF OF SHOWN WITHIN HHS THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. IS THAT PROVIDE THAT TOP COVER IN BRINGING DEPARTMENTS TOGETHER DO IN FACT IMPROVE THE SERVICES -- I WOULD HIGHLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK MORE INTO THE U. K. GDS AND THE USPS MODELS. I THINK THEY ARE AN EXCELLENT MODEL THE CALIFORNIA SHUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. YOU MORE PUBLIC COMMENT. THREE NINE SENATOR STEVEN OPENING. YES YES EVER MADE THANK YOU VERY MUCH SECRETARY WILKENING WE APPRECIATE ALL YOUR TIME AND ALL YOUR ANSWERS. WE OR DID YOU. WILL GET YOU ANOTHER TIME JUST KIDDING. OKAY WE ARE GOING TO ISSUE. SIXTEEN CENSUS OUT REACH OKAY [inaudible] GOOD MORNING [inaudible] OKAY -- GO AHEAD INTRODUCED. GOOD MORNING WELCOME. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND SENATOR UMBERG THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INVITING ME HERE -- TO TESTIFY ABOUT THE EFFORTS FOR THE COMPLETE COUNTY OFFICE SINCE IT'S TWENTY TWENTY I DO THIS GUITAR AGAIN AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA. COUNTY CENSUS TWENTY TWENTY OFFICE. DID YOU KNOW THE DECENNIAL CENSUS IS LESS THAN A YEAR AWAY. AND IT IS THE LARGEST FEDERAL OPERATION OUTSIDE GOING TO WAR. WE APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT AND COMMITMENT OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THE LEGISLATURE IN FUNDING OUR STATE WHITE EFFORTS TO DATE FOR THE COMPLETE COUNT OFFICE. AND I WANT TO REMIND FOLKS THAT THE MISSION OF THE CALIFORNIA COMPLETE COUNT OFFICE IS TO ENSURE THE CALIFORNIANS GET THEIR FAIR SHARE OUR FAIR SHARE OF FEDERAL RESOURCES. AND FEDERAL CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATION BY ENCOURAGING A FULL PARTICIPATION OF ALL CALIFORNIANS IN THE DECENNIAL CENSUS. OF THE JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL INCLUDES FIFTY FOUR MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION TO AUGMENT ACTIVITIES BY THE CALIFORNIA COMPLETE COUNT OFFICE TO FURTHER ENHANCE OUR EFFORTS CURRENTLY UNDER WAY TO ENSURE A FULL AND ACCURATE COUNT. OF OUR ENTIRE POPULATION. CENTER UMBERG. WE PLAN TO USE THE SYNERGY. OF THE INTERFACE WHAT ARE HARD TO GET OUT. TO HAVE AN EFFECTIVE DIALOGUE. AND WE'RE GOING TO LEVERAGE OUR PARTNERS OUT THERE SO I JUST WANT TO THROW THAT ONE IN SHE'S PAYMENT TO AND I'M THINKING. HE IS REALLY GETTING THAT THAN TO FIND A USE FOR THOSE WORDS. KIDS ARE OUTREACH EFFORTS THAT FOCUS ON THE HARDEST ACCOUNT FOR THOSE WHO BEEN HISTORICALLY UNDERCOUNTED IN THE SENSE. ACTUALLY FIFTY MILLION WOULD BE PROVIDED TO AUGMENT OUTREACH EFFORTS LIKE ME BASS ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL AS THE OUTREACH AND PUBLIC RELATIONS MEDIA CAMPAIGN CONTRACTORS. SPECIFICALLY OUR REGIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE BASED ORGANIZATIONS RECEIVE SUPPORT FOR THE NON RESPONSE FOLLOW UP IT'S CALLED OUR FOOD WE USE ACRONYMS A LOT THE NERVE FOR PERIOD. WHICH BEGINS IN APRIL TWENTY TWENTY AND CONTINUES THROUGH LATE JULY. NERF WHO IS THE US CENSUS BUREAU'S EFFORT THAT THE ON THE GROUND TO KNOCK ON DOORS OF HOUSEHOLDS WHO HAVE NOT YET RESPONDED. THE ORIGINAL ALLOCATION WAS FOR TWENTY TWO POINT. NINE AND THAT'S GONNA BE AUGMENTED BY TEN MILLION TO REACH COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE THAT LOW RESPONSE RATE AS THE ENUMERATION CONTINUES. ADDITIONAL WORD OPPORTUNITIES FOR WORDS TO FILL IN THE GAPS TO BE RESPONSIVE TO AREAS THAT NEED FURTHER OUT REACH. THE CURRENT BUDGET PROVIDED FOUR POINT ZERO FIVE MILLION WHICH WE AWARDED ACTUALLY LAST WEEK AND THAT WILL BE AUGMENTED BY APPROXIMATELY ANOTHER FIVE POINT NINE FIVE MILLION. TO FURTHER TARGETED OUT REACHED HARD COUNT POPULATIONS AND FORMAL POPULATIONS. IN ADDITION THE OUTREACH AND PUBLIC RELATIONS OR WHAT WE CALL THE MEDIA CAMPAIGN IT'S OUR AIR GAME WILL BE AUGMENTED BY THIRTY MILLION. TO ACHIEVE STATEWIDE AWARENESS CAMPAIGN THAT IS MULTI LINGUAL CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE AND THAT ENGAGES LOCAL ETHNIC MEDIA. TO BUILD OUR BASE OF TRUST THE MESSENGERS BECAUSE WE KNOW CALIFORNIANS NO CALIFORNIA'S BEST. IN SOME THAT BRINGS THE TOTAL OUT REACH FUNDING BETWEEN THE CURRENT. AND NEXT FISCAL YEAR TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS STATEWIDE. AN ADDITIONAL ITEM IN THIS PROPOSAL IS THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING AND POPULATION SAMPLE ENUMERATION WE CALLED GYPSY FOR SHORT. OF THE FOUR MILLION FUNDING WILL BE SUPPORT THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING POPULATION SAMPLE ENUMERATION PLYMOUTH WILL WHICH IS A STUDY BEING CONDUCTED. BY THE DEPARTMENT FINANCES DEMOGRAPHIC RESEARCH UNIT. THE STUDY WILL PROVIDE SEVERAL IMPORTANT DATA SETS FOLLOWING THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS. THIS INCLUDES HELPING TO IDENTIFY HOW SUCCESSFUL WERE WE IN ACHIEVING A FULL AND COMPLETE COUNCIL LOOKING FOR SOME OF THOSE MEASURABLES THOSE METRICS WHAT BARRIERS EXISTED THAT BLOCKED OUR OUTRAGE FROM BEING SUCCESSFUL. WE MIGHT EVEN HEAR SOME STUFF EFFORTS IN THAT AND HOW CAN WE BEST PREPARE FOR THE TWENTY THIRTY CENTS. SO THAT LAST POINT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE CALIFORNIA COMPLETELY OFF HELD OFFICE IS WORKING DILIGENTLY NOT ONLY TO REPAIR FOR SUCH A TWENTY TWENTY BUT WE'RE ALSO WORKING TO ESTABLISH A WELL DOCUMENTED REPEATABLE OPERATION AND STRATEGY. THAT WILL SERVE THE STATE AGAIN EVERYTHING EVEN THOUGH I DID THE TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND TEN WE BUILT FROM SCRATCH WITH THE WITH THE GREAT HELP OF GOVERNMENT OPS. OPERATIONS. EIGHT PREPARING FOR THE NEXT CYCLE BEYONCE. I'M JUST IN CLOSING A FINAL NOTE THIS WEEK ACROSS THE STATE -- COMMUNITIES ARE HOLDING THEIR KICKOFFS ESSENCES TWENTY TO TWENTY A DAY IS APRIL FIRST JUST A YEAR AWAY. WE KNOW THAT THAT'S A TWENTY WILL BE CHALLENGING BUT MY TEAM AND OUR PARTNERS ACROSS THE STATE. ARE SAN PREPARED INNER PREPARING RIGHT NOW -- TO ENGAGE AND DO THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO ENSURE COMPLETE COUNT. THEY SAY IT TAKES A VILLAGE BUT I'M HERE TO SAY IT TAKES ALL VILLAGES AND COMMUNITIES OF CALIFORNIA TO ENSURE A COMPLETE AND ACCURATE COUNT. I WITH THAT WERE ABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU. I DO LIKE TO GO AHEAD. AND JUST HOW ARE FROM THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY I JUST IN HERE SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND ECHO EVERYTHING DIRECTOR. JUST [inaudible] GREAT [inaudible] LA YOU. I WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL AND JUST KNOW THAT IT'S CONSISTENT WITH PAST LEGISLATIVE ACTION IN THIS AREA. YOUR FRIENDS. NOTHING. OKAY SENATOR UMBERG. THANK YOU DIRECTORS THE DOGGIE. WE CAN'T UNDERESTIMATE PORTENTS OF YOUR JOB IN OUR EFFORT HERE. IT'S CRITICAL CALIFORNIA -- COUPLE THINGS TERMS OF METRICS -- IT AND WE DON'T NEED TO DO IT TODAY BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE USEFUL FOR US TO SEE NO DOUBT YOU HAVE THEM YOU KNOW HERE'S YOU KNOW HOW MANY. PEOPLE WE INTENDED TOUCH THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA HERE'S HOW MANY P. AND HERE'S HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT HERE SO MANY PEOPLE WE INTEND TO TOUCH THROUGH. COULD MEET WHATEVER IT MAY BE -- ONE AREA OF CONCERN. MANY YEARS OF CONCERT BUT ONE PARTICULAR AREA OF CONCERN. IT WITH IS IS WITH RESPECT -- TO SORT OF A A COUNTER -- COUNTER INSURGENCY APPROACH IN THE SENSE THAT. I WOULD EXPECT THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE FAKE NEWS POINT IN TERMS OF FAKE NEWS WITH RESPECT. TO FOR EXAMPLE ICE AGENTS APPEARING AT SOMEONE'S DOOR AS A CONSEQUENCE OF FILLING OUT THE QUESTIONNAIRE IF THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION SHOULD BE ON THE ON THE QUESTIONNAIRE. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO TO TO ADDRESS THAT ARE WE PREPARED TO ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT GOES VIRAL THAT'S THAT'S GOING? TO RATED AN ATMOSPHERE OF INTIMIDATION IF IT DOESN'T ALREADY EXIST. YES SO IN OUR OUTREACH AND PUBLIC RELATIONS MEDIA OR P. WHICH WE JUST LET AND HAD A BIGGER CONFERENCE LAST WEEK WE PUT THAT IN THERE IN TERMS OF MANAGING MISINFORMATION DISINFORMATION. AND A WHAT WE CALL CRISIS COMMUNICATIONS OF WE REALLY LOOK AT THIS SIMILAR TO HOW YOU RUN A CAMPAIGN IS IT'S MISINFORMATION IS AT OPS RESEARCH WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO BE DOING. THAT MAY DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM COMING OUT. BUT IN ADDITION TO LIKE IF YOU THINK IT AS A CAMPAIGN WISE WERE LAYING THE GROUNDWORK RIGHT NOW THROUGH ALL OF OUR COMMUNITY BASED GROUPS IS WE'RE DOING THIS NETWORK ON THE GROUND. SO EVEN FURTHER THAN IF YOU WOULD IN A IN A RUNNING FOR OFFICE WE'RE PUTTING THIS THE SORT OF BUTTON BLANKET MATCH. PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE TRUTH IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT AFFECTS OUR COMMUNITIES AND THAT CAN HELP US ONE MONITOR SOME OF MISINFORMATION BECAUSE SOME OF THAT HAPPENS. DOWN ON THE GROUND AND THAT CAN SPEAK TRUTH TO IT AND THAT CAN HOPEFULLY QUELCH AND PUSH OUT ANYTHING THAT GOES VIRAL WE WANT TO GO VIRAL WITH THE RIGHT THINGS. AND THE RIGHT MESSAGES SO THAT'S REALLY WHY WITH OUR GROUND GAME AN AIR GAME ARE REALLY INTEGRATED -- AND MY WERE ACTIVATING NOW OF THE MESSAGING WE HAVE NOW IS MORE ABOUT EDUCATING WERE REALLY BUILDING. THAT STRENGTHEN ALMOST PLATOON MY PLATOON -- THROUGHOUT OUR OUR OUR STATE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN COMBAT ANY OF THAT THAT COMES UP BUT YOU KNOW WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY'LL COME UP WITH BUT WE STAND READY. I CAN ADD TO THAT JUST A LITTLE BIT FROM MORE TECHNICAL PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE ONE THING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE PROGRAM THERE ESTABLISH HERE'S CREAM VERY NIMBLE PROCESS SO THAT IF WE NEED TO REMOVE RESOURCES QUICKLY TO COMBAT THOSE TYPES OF THINGS WE CAN. SO WE HAVE OUR CONTRACTOR PARTNERS THAT ARE OUT THERE WE ARE WE HAVE REGULAR CHECK INS WITH THEM WE ALSO SET ASIDE FUNDING AND THEN WEEK AND AS WE HEAR THOSE THINGS DEVELOP ON THE GROUND. WE CAN THEN DIRECT THEM TO MOVE RESOURCES TO COMBAT THOSE DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS AS THEY SHOULD IF THEY SHOULD MATERIALIZE SO. ONE THING THAT WERE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION EVERYTHING WE DO -- THAT FLEXIBILITY THAT WE NEED IN OUR CONTRACT TO QUICKLY MOVE MONEY TO THOSE AREAS WE HAVE THOSE TYPES OF CONCERNS SO. WHEN A POINT THAT OUT? SO BUT LET ME AGAIN I COMMEND YOUR EFFORTS -- AGAIN WE CAN'T. OVER EMPHASIZE ITS IMPORTANCE IS THE UNIQUE SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHO IS. WHETHER STATED OR UNSTATED IS INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE THE CALIFORNIA HAS AN UNDERCOUNT IN A STATE GOVERNMENT THAT IS VITALLY INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE WE GET AN ACCURATE COUNT SO. WE WISH YOU WELL -- I HAVE A A FEW QUESTIONS AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL THE WORK THAT YOU -- STARTED TO DO. AND THE THING THERE'S ANY ISSUES ABOUT HOW CRITICAL AND AND HOME POINT. OF MANY MANY CALIFORNIANS DON'T UNDERSTAND. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ACCOUNT AND THE CENSUS TO OUR WELL BEING AND IN THE STATE. BUT IF YOU COULD -- IN TERMS OF THE HARD TO COUNT. OF POPULATION AND YOU KNOW FAMILIES. GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT WHO THAT IS. AND HOW DOES YOUR HOW DOES A PROPOSAL FOR THE YOU KNOW THE BUDGET. ADDRESS. THE HARD TO COUNT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY. ANYBODY IS NOT HARD TO COUNT WILL HAVE A PROBLEM WE COULD DO IT IN A VERY TRADITIONAL WAY NO BIG DEAL. BUT IT'S THE HARD TO COUNT THAT WERE REALLY. MUCH MORE FOCUSED ON SO. THAT IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE BUDGET AND MY STRATEGY. SO I ALWAYS SAY I'M FILIPINO AMERICAN BUT I'M REALLY NOT HARD TO COUNT SO I HOPE NOT TO SEE ANY OF OUR STATES OUTREACH EFFORTS ARE EFFORTS AND ALL OF US HERE WILL OBVIOUSLY FILL IT OUT. OUR EFFORT TO REALLY FOCUS ON WHAT WE LOOK AT THOSE HARD TO HELP POPULATIONS WE ALSO LOOK AT HARD TO COUNT CENSUS TRACKS OR GEOGRAPHY. BECAUSE THE THE U. S. CENSUS IS EIGHT ADDRESS BASED ENUMERATION WE KIND OF CUT IT BOTH WAYS SO WE HAVE HARD TO COUNT -- DEMOGRAPHIC POPULATIONS WHICH I CALL A BORDER POPULATIONS WHICH INCLUDE YOU KNOW THE ASIAN AMERICAN LATINOS AFRICAN AMERICANS MIDDLE EASTERN NORTH AFRICANS NATIVE AMERICANS YOU KNOW A PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. UP PEOPLE WITH LOW BROADBAND AS A WHOLE LIST OF FIFTEEN DIFFERENT -- WELL CALLED DEMOGRAPHIC POPULATIONS AND THEN WE LOOK AT ACROSS THE STATE WE'VE TAKEN THAT THE FIGHTING IS WERE DOING I WHICH FOR THE THE CENSUS. AND WE HAD YOU SENSE OF DATA TO ACTUALLY DO THIS EXAMINATION SO WE LOOK AT GEOGRAPHICALLY AREAS THAT HAVE VARIABLE SO THAT'S ALL DATA BASED. THAT WOULD WOULD ACTUALLY OVERLY TO PROMOTE THAT THAT THAT PEOPLE LIVING IN THOSE AREAS WILL BE HARD TO COUNT. FOR EXAMPLE IN A LOS ANGELES COUNTY THEY HAVE ONE OF THEIR KEY FACTORS IS CROWDED HOUSING UNITS RIGHT BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE DOUBLING UP BECAUSE RENTS. AND HOUSING IS SO EXPENSIVE YOU CAN HAVE THREE OR FOUR FAMILIES LIVING IN A SINGLE UNIT THE HOUSE WANT TO DRESS. SO OVERCROWDING MEANS THAT THAT ADDRESS WILL GET ONE POSTCARD OR ONE FORM AND ONE PERSON THAT THE CALL HAD A THE US CENSUS RECALLS HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD. WILL FILL IT OUT BUT IF THE ONLY FILL OUT FOR ONE OF THE FAMILIES THEY'VE JUST LOT LOST TWO OF THE OTHER FAMILIES. LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY IS ANOTHER FACTOR THAT THAT WE OVERLAY UP IN THOSE AREAS AND SO WE LOOK AT THE DENSITY OF PEOPLE HEARD CROWDED UNITS LIMITED. ENGLISH PROFICIENCY EDUCATIONAL FOLKS THAT ARE -- MAYBE PER RECEIVING PUBLIC ASSISTANCE. LOOKING AT OTHER THINGS LIKE RENTER'S SO THERE'S A NUMBER WAY SO WE LOOK AT AND THEN THE WAY WE DO OUR BUDGET IS WE LOOK AT WHERE. AT THREE WAYS WHERE THEY ARE REGIONAL WE HAVE A REGIONALLY CBO'S A WE DEDICATED. THIRTY PLUS ADDITIONAL TEN CENTS FORTY MILLION OF THE HUNDRED FORTY TO THAT. THEN ALSO COUNTIES SO AND DEDICATED ABOUT THIRTY MILLION -- FOR THEM AS WELL SO IT'S UNDER SIXTY OR SO THAT WOULD BE FORTY PLUS I'M DOING ALL THE MATH IN MY HEAD SORRY. AND THEN WE DID A STATEWIDE CBO'S WHICH IS WHO THEY ARE THIS FIFTEEN DEMOGRAPHIC VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND THEN THE FINAL KIND OF LEG OF THE STOOL IS HOW DO WE GET TO THEM IT'S OUR SECTOR. OUTRAGE WHICH IS HOW DO YOU GET TO THEM THROUGH UNIONS THROUGH SCHOOLS THROUGH -- FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS THROUGH EMPLOYERS OUT I THINK PERSONALLY THAT AT THIS OF MY THIRD DECENNIAL CENSUS. OF THE YOUTH ARE GOING TO BE VERY KEY IN HELPING US REACH ALL THOSE POPULATIONS -- AND FRANKLY I'VE A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD THEY'RE PRETTY CHARGED UP ABOUT SHE'S SAYING I CAN'T VOTE BUT I CAN. AND I CAN GET EVERYBODY TO COUNT AND SHE GOES TO PUBLIC SCHOOL HERE IN OF SACRAMENTO. MANY OF HER -- OF COLLEAGUES FOR STUDENTS THEIR PARENTS DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH AT HOME AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY GONNA BE THE ONES THAT FILL OUT THOSE FORMS. SO I DON'T KNOW IF I MAY DIDN'T DO ALL THE NUMBERS WITH THAT BUT I WANTED TO BREAK IT DOWN INTO. HOW WE ARE SORT OF BLANKETING AND DISTURBING THOSE DOLLARS ON THE GROUND AND THEN WE HAVE THAT AIR GAME WHICH IS THE THE ETHNIC MEDIA -- REALLY CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE MESSAGING THAT WILL COMBINE WITH THE GROUND. WELL JUST SAID JUST ADD TO THAT IS EVERYTHING THAT WE DO IS REALLY TO THAT DATA. SO WE'RE LOOKING AT FUNDING AND WHERE WE NEED TO DEDICATE RESOURCES AS OF WE REALLY ARE TARGETING WHERE THE HEART IDENTIFIED HER ACCOUNT POPULATION ARE WE KNOW THAT. AND WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DEMOGRAPHIC RESEARCH UNIT AS WELL AS THE DATA THAT WE GOT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INSTANCES. IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHO THE HARD TO COUNTER WHERE THEY ARE SO THEN WE LOOK TO SPREAD THOSE RESOURCES THROUGHOUT THE STATE WITH A LOOK TO SPREAD THEM BASED UPON THE CONCENTRATIONS OF THOSE. POPULATIONS IN A VERY SERIOUS OF SOME AREAS HAVE VERY HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF LA FOR EXAMPLE IS THE HARDEST ACCOUNT COUNTY RETIRE COUNTRY THE ORDERS COME IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY -- IN FACT CALIFORNIA'S TEN OF THE TOP FIFTY HARD DISCOUNT COUNTIES IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. IT'S ALL BASED UPON THAT DATA AND THAT AND THE RESOURCES GOING OUT ACCORDING TO THAT DATA SO SOME AREAS WILL GET MORE MONEY BASED UPON THAT NUMBER PARTY COUNTY [inaudible] OF YOU MENTIONED -- LIMITED ENGLISH COULD YOU GO INTO THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE IN TERMS OF LANGUAGE ACCESS BECAUSE THERE ARE SO. MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND SO MANY DIFFERENT LANGUAGES HOME EVERYBODY BOASTS ABOUT HOW WE WERE WE ARE SO WONDERFUL AND DIVERSE IN THIS STATE -- AND COMES WITH THAT IS THE LANGUAGE OF SO MANY CULTURES AND COMMUNITIES SO. TALK TO ME ABOUT THAT WELL I KNOW THAT -- WILL PROBABLY HAVE A A LONGER DISCUSSION ABOUT OUR LANGUAGE ACCESS WERE THE ONLY A STATE. ARE THAT HAS ACTUALLY INVESTED IN OUR HAVING A LANGUAGE ACCESS AND COMMUNICATIONS STANDARDS. BUT I WANT TO START REALLY HAVE TO START THE BASELINE OF WHAT IS THE US CENSUS BUREAU DOING WITH THEIR LANGUAGE ACCESS. OUR BECAUSE THEN THAT ALLOWS US TO FIGURE OUT OKAY WHAT ARE THE GAPS AND WHERE TO REFILL IT. SO. I THINK WE MENTIONED THAT IT'LL BE THE FIRST ONLINE CENSUS EVER -- SO WERE NOT ONLY DEALING WITH LANGUAGE ACCESS BUT COMPUTER LITERACY AND ACCESS -- TO ACTUALLY THE ONLINE FORM THE ONLY FORM WILL BE IN TWELVE LANGUAGES THOSE TWELVE LANGUAGES ARE IDENTIFIED FROM. AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY DATA THE TOTALING WHICH IS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL ARE NOT THE NECESSARILY THE TWELVE LANGUAGES YOU'RE IN CALIFORNIA. IN ADDITION YOU CAN GET A PAPER FORM AND AGAIN I'M NOT WITH THE US CENSUS BUREAU BUT I I KNOW ENOUGH TO BE DANGEROUS RIGHT. SO YOU CAN GET A PAPER FORM BUT IT'S ONLY GONNA BE IN ENGLISH AND IN SPANISH. ALSO YOU CAN ACTUALLY CALL TO GET BACK. ON THE THIRD WAY THAT THE US CENSUS BUREAU WANTS US TO TO KNOW THAT PEOPLE CAN RESPOND. IS BY TELEPHONE QUESTION QUESTIONNAIRE ASSIST THE COUNTY Q. A TITLE FOR CREEK TELEPHONE QUESTIONNAIRE ASSISTANCE AND THAT'LL BE IN THOSE SAME TWELVE LANGUAGES WHERE THEY CAN ACTUALLY TALK TO SOMEONE ON THE PHONE. SO MY EIGHTY THREE YEAR OLD MOTHER THAT SPEECH FROM REALLY TAGALOG NOT SO GREAT ON THE IPAD IF I SIXTEEN HELP SIR SHE GOT TO CALL. EIGHTEEN AN EIGHT HER NUMBER SHE CAN UNDERSTAND THEM HOPEFULLY -- THEY CAN HELP -- INTO CALLING FILL OUT THE FORM -- SO WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN ADDITION THEY WILL ALSO DO FIFTY NINE LANGUAGE GUIDES. WHICH MEANS -- SO IF MY MOM CAN'T COLIN MY DAUGHTER CAN PULL THE LANGUAGE GOTTEN TAGALOG BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T SPEAK TAGALOG. UNFORTUNATELY AND SHE CAN KIND OF FIGURE BRITISH CAN WALK THROUGH. AND HELP MY MOTHER -- FILL OUT THE THE THING SO WE ARE LOOKING PRIMARILY AT WHAT ARE THEY DOING AND THEN WE HAVE PULLED THE DATA -- FOR CALIFORNIA IT'S BEEN INTERESTING TO TRY TO GET DATA DOWN TO THE GRANULAR LEVEL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT THE U. S. CENSUS BUREAU IS DOING IS THEY'RE LOOKING AT HOUSEHOLD LIMITED ENGLISH. WE ARE TRYING TO GET THE DATA TO REALLY LOOK AT INDIVIDUALS SO THAT GIVES US EVEN MORE COVERAGE AND WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO COMPARE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL I'M CALLING FOR YOUR HE'S SORRY. AT THE COUNTY LEVEL ONE OF THOSE WHAT WHAT'S LACKING SO LET'S SAY IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY. A WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE COVERING 98% OF LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT SO WE'LL LOOK AT THAT DATA WE'LL SEE HOW MANY LANGUAGES THAT ENTAIL IS THAT ALL. TWO HUNDRED BLOOM AROUND TEN OR ELEVEN DOES THAT MATCH THE TEN OR ELEVEN LANGUAGES THAT THE U. S. CENSUS VERY DOESN'T MATCH WHAT WE WANT TO DO HERE AT THE STATE LEVEL HOW CAN WE FILL THOSE GAPS THAT'S KIND OF JUST A AND WE'RE STILL IN. WE'RE STILL IN DEVELOPMENT -- AND AS WE GET THE DATA WILL BE ABLE. TO HELP. KIND OF DISSECT AND REALLY TARGET BECAUSE ALL OUR EFFORTS AS I JUST SINCE OTHER ART DATA INTENSIVE -- BUT WE ARE WE START WITH THAT AND THEN WE WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS TO FIND OUT YOU KNOW WHAT IS TRUTH. ON THE GROUND IN TERMS OF WHO NEEDS THE MOST. I'LL JUST ADD TO THAT THAT -- WE HAVE PUT OUT A DRAFT LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATION ACCESS STANDARDS THAT WHERE. BACK ON THE STAKEHOLDERS WE PRESENTED AT THE LAST CALIFORNIA THE COUNT COMMITTEE MEETING -- WE'VE GOTTEN SOME GOOD FEEDBACK AND WE HOPE TO LACKEY IN CORPORATE THAT FEEDBACK INTO A FINAL PRODUCT OFFICE YEP FINAL PRODUCT IS REALLY GOING TO DICTATE WHAT OUR PARTNERS ONTHE GROUND YOU TO FOLLOW -- BY WHAT IS REQUIRED WHAT'S NOT REQUIRED SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE'RE CONSIDERING AND THAT'S STILL IN DEVELOPMENT WITH HOPEFULLY TOWARDS THE END OF THIS MONTH WILL HAVE ANOTHER. ITERATION IT MIGHT BE A DRAFT MAYBE MORE FINAL BUT WILL HAVE ANOTHER ITERATION HOEFULLY WE COULD SHARE -- WITH EVERYONE. I KNOW THEIR EFFORTS IN THE FOUNDATION OR IN PHILANTHROPY ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR -- TO ALSO VERY THEY'RE VERY MOTIVATED AS WELL -- COULD YOU TALK ABOUT HOW WE'LL WHAT IS OUR EFFORT TO COORDINATE HOME SO THAT WE DON'T DUPLICATE -- ABSOLUTELY WHATEVER RESOURCES WE HAVE AND USE THEM TO THEIR MAXIMUM. SO I CAME ABOARD -- ACTUALLY IN THE DEMOGRAPHICS RESEARCH UNIT IN APRIL TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND I WAS KIND OF BY MYSELF FOR ABOUT A YEAR. I AND SO I ACTUALLY AT THAT POINT AND I HAD NO BUDGET. BUT NOT FOUNDATIONS WHO I WILL SAY IN. TWO THOUSAND TEN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TWENTY FOUR MILLION TWO THOUSAND TEN I HAD. TWO MILLION ACTUALLY ONE MILLION AND TWO MILLION AND SO IN TWO THOUSAND TEN THOSE FOUNDATIONS THAT WE HAVE FUNDED IN -- TWO THOUSAND WHO DID AMAZING WORK THEY CAME FORTH AND DEDICATED ABOUT NINE MILLION OF THEIR OWN DOLLARS. SO AS I CAME IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN IT WAS FOUNDATIONS WERE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT HOW WE NEED TO START TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO. FOR TWENTY OF PARTICULARLY -- AFTER FALL OF TWENTY SIXTEEN THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE TO START THIS CONVERSATION EARLIER. SO WE'VE BEEN HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS UP FRONT OTHERS A COUPLE KEY FOUNDATIONS THAT HAVE ALREADY INVESTED. MILLIONS OF THEIR OWN THE CALIFORNIAN DUMB IS ONE THAT DEFINITELY COMES TO MIND AND WE'VE BEEN PARTNERING OFTEN VERY BEGINNING -- WE ALSO MEET WITH SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GRANT MAKERS GRANT MAKERS CONCERNED WITH IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEES NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AT GRANT MAKERS AND THEN OUR ADMINISTRATIVE. OUT TO ME BASS ORGANIZATIONS THOSE ARE MAINLY FOUNDATIONS THAT HAVE -- THAT ADMINISTRATIVE REACH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THOSE REGIONS IN ORDER. TO TAKE THE STATE REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE WE DO HAVEREQUIREMENTS ON OUR DOLLARS AND BE ABLE TO PUSH THOSE OUT. NOW THERE ARE THOSE WHO ALREADY INVESTED I MENTIONED A FEW OF THEM AND THERE'S BEEN A BIG GROUP HAVE BEEN MEETING IN A FUNDER CIRCLE BOTH NATIONALLY AND LOCALLY. TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND AND FRANKLY SOME OF THEM IN LIKE WOW THE STATE YOU KNOW THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY -- WE'VE TOLD THEM DON'T PULL BACK JUST LET'S GET WE'RE GONNA LAY OUR FOUNDATION BUT THERE'S GOING TO BE THINGS. THAT WE CAN'T FUND FRANKLY WITH STATE TAX DOLLARS AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING TO PROBABLY LEAN ON OUR PARTNERS TO SAY THIS IS WHERE WE NEED TO HELP YOU TO HELP US. FILL THOSE GAPS SO WE'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THEM AS WE HEAD INTO THE SUMMER WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING OUR IMPLEMENTATION PLAN WORKSHOPS. WHERE BOTH THIS FOUNDATIONS ALL ARE FUNDED PARTNERS AND THOSE ON THE GROUND WILL COME TOGETHER TO SAY WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DEPLOY COME JANUARY? SO WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING THIS FALL OF WHAT THOSE GAPS ARE AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A PLAN TO FILL THOSE. AND FINALLY -- I BELIEVE THAT. WORKING THROUGH OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION INFRASTRUCTURE -- THAT'S A GREAT ADVANTAGE AND A GREAT RESOURCE FOR GETTING OUT ESPECIALLY TO HARD TO COUNT. I MEAN THERE IS IT THERE'S PROBABLY THERE'S VERY FEW PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. THAT HAVE THE TRUST. OF OUR SISTERS AND BROTHERS IN THE HARD TO COUNT COMMUNITIES -- SO -- AGAIN I CAN'T THINK OF YOU KNOW TEACHER COULD WALK UP AND KNOCK ON THE DOOR OF SOMEONE. AND THERE'D BE NO PROBLEM NO ISSUES OF TRUST-- YOU KNOW OTHERS OR YOU KNOW HOW DIFFERENT TITLES AND POSITIONS THAT WOULD BE SO EASY TO DO. OR THEY CAN JUST DO IT THROUGH THEIR CHILDREN THROUGH THE MEDIAN SO WHATEVER IT IS WHATEVER LEGALLY THEY'RE ALLOWED TO DO. BUT I BELIEVE THEY NEED THE RESOURCES BECAUSE THE INFRASTRUCTURE ALREADY EXISTS WE DON'T HAVE TO HIRE MORE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TO DO ALL THESE OTHER THINGS. THEY ALREADY EXIST. TALK TO ME ABOUT THAT AND BY I KNOW IN. THE BUDGET IT'S ACTUALLY A VERY SMALL. UP AMOUNT AND I DON'T KNOW THAT. BY NOT INVESTING. YOUNG IN THAT PARTICULAR SECTOR WE MAY BE MISSING THE BOAT. RIGHT -- SO THANK YOU FOR THAT I DO BELIEVE THE YOUTH ARE THAT IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE DID GET SOME FUNDING SO WHAT I NOTICED IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND TEN THE WORK OF THE US CENSUS BUREAU WAS THEY HAD A SENSE OF SOME SCHOOLS PRORAM. AND THEY PARTNERED WITH SCHOLASTIC. SCHOLASTIC INC YOU KNOW SCHOLASTIC. AND THEY SENT US LIKE PALLETS OF THINGS TO HAND OUT BUT IT BUT FRANKLY THERE REALLY PRETTY BUT THERE WAS A DAY LATE AND A DOLLAR SHORT WE COULDN'T POSSIBLY GET IT OUT A WEEK BEFORE. SO TWO THOUSAND TEN SAME THING SLOW TO IT SO IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHEN I CAME IN A SAID WE NEED TO START WITH SCHOOLS SO WE TOOK SOME DOLLARS WE INVESTED -- WE CONTACTED -- SACRAMENTO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION FRANK PZ RUNS THERE -- HISTORY SOCIAL SCIENCE CURRICULUM WE SAID HOW DO WE WORK IT INTO THE CURRICULUM WE DON'T PUT MORE ON TEACHERS IN TERMS OF THAT BUT WE HAD A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. TO ENGAGE FIFTH EIGHTH ELEVENTH AND TWELFTH GRADERS AT THE TIME I DOLLARS IN EIGHTH GRADE AND SHE WITH. WHAT CAME HOME FROM HER AND GET HISTORY THING SHE'S A MOM WE TALK ABOUT THE CENSUS TODAY? AND ISN'T REALLY WHAT DID YOU TALK ABOUT SHE SAID IT WAS A GLOSSARY WORD. AND THAT WAS IT. AND I SAID WELL DID YOU SAY ANYTHING AS HE SAID YEAH I DID IT BECAUSE MY DAUGHTER. AND SHE TOLD THEM WHY IT WAS SO IMPORTANT THAT YOU HAD TO FILL THIS OUT AND A PERSON TEACHERS LIKE -- YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW VOIGTS IT JUST EVERY YEAR AND THE KIDS SAID I'M NOT THE OWNER OUT. AND SHE SAID WATCH LIKE. IT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION THAT'S LOOK LIKE MY PRIVACY IS ONLY ONE AND SHE SAID TO THEM. YOU KNOW YOU FOR A LOT MORE WHEN YOU FILL OUT A WHAT YOU KNOW HOUSE OF A WIZARDRY YOU KNOW HUFFLEPUFF THAT YOU ARE WHEN YOU FILL OUT A BUS. FOR BECAUSE HE WANTED TO PUT IT IN THE LIKE IT'S SAFE SO THE ANYWAYS LONG STORY SO I SAID YOU KNOW WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE HISTORY SOCIAL SCIENCE TEACHERS IN FIFTH. EIGHT ELEVEN TWELVE THAT'S A TIME WHEN THEY'RE LEARNING ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION THAT'S WHEN THEY'RE LEARNING ABOUT OUR STATE'S HISTORY THAT'S WHEN THEY'RE LEARNING ABOUT AMERICAN GOVERNMENT. TWELFTH GRADERS STUDY AMERICAN GOVERNMENT THAT'S WE'RE CREATING OUR VOTERS RIGHT WE'RE CREATING THAT CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. SO THEY'VE PULLED ELEVENTH TWELFTH FIFTH AND EIGHTH GRADERS AT LA LAKERS ALWAYS IT IS ALSO INVOLVED AND THE CREATED A CURRICULUM -- AND PACING GUIDES THAT WOULD TAKE A SAID FRANK IT'S GONNA TAKE A TEACHER LESS THAN TEN IS A GREAT WAY TO PUT THAT IN. BECAUSE WE CAN'T PUT MORE IN OUR TEACHERS SO THERE TO POINT OUT RIGHT NOW ACTIVELY BUT IN ADDITION WE HAVE A WE'VE PROPOSED OF FORTY DIFFERENT COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. DOLLARS AND WE WANT TO REQUIRE THEM WHEN THEY GET THE DOLLARS TO HAVE A SENSE THIS WEEK TO OPEN UP THEIR PARENT RESOURCE CENTERS ON THE COMPUTER CENTERS IN THE MEDIA CENTERS WHERE THERE'S ACTUALLY. YOU KNOW ACCESS TO THE INTERNET TO HAVE THOSE OPEN. A SAFE PLACE FOR PARENTS TO COME TO BE ABLE TO FILL OUT THE FORM SO WE CAN STAFF OF WITH WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED GROUPS ARE WE CAN ACTUALLY STEPPED IN WITH THE YOUTH THAT ARE GONNA WELCOME AND LEARN ABOUT THIS -- SO IT'S IT'S A MASSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S OUT THERE AND WE SHOULD ABSOLUTELY TAP INTO IT -- WE'VE DEDICATED ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE MILLION OF OUR OUR BUDGET -- TO THAT AND WE'RE CURRENTLY -- IN CONTRACT WE'RE DOING ALL THE CONTRACTS WITH ALL THE WE DID FORTY OF THEM WHICH WERE THE TOP TITLE ONE ENTITLED THREE WHICH IS SCHOOL LUNCH. ARE AND LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT. OUT TO TRY TO GET THOSE DOLLARS OUT. YOU CAN GET SOME OF THE MONEY FROM THE PR AND PUT IT IN THERE. OKAY -- SEVERAL BURKE ANYMORE. A COUPLE QUESTIONS ONE A AND A LOOK FOR DISSING THE METRICS NUMBER TWO IS WE'RE GONNA DO LITTLE STICKERS THE I COUNTED STICKERS. YOU GOT A PEN. ARE WE GONNA DO THE STICKERS LIKE THE I VOTED STICKERS YES CORD ARM OKAY YEAH. HELLO CAM THAT THE BUDGET THANK YOU. OKAY I'M A TO OPEN IT UP TO PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE. MADAM CHAIR OF MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME THAT THE RECORD MONA. AND I WORK FOR IN PRINT MEDIA WHICH ALSO OWNS Là PIGNON AN OPINION THAT IDEA. AND WE ARE HERE I'M SORRY I JUST I JUST WANT WE HAVE A A NUMBER OF SPEAKERS WE JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU TO KEEP IT. ONE TO TWO MINUTES FOR A SHORT THAT'S ALREADY GOING. TO ABSOLUTELY THANK. ANY BUT I JUST WANT TO WELCOME AND THANK EVERYBODY THANK YOU MADAM. CHAIR AND I'M ALSO HERE COMPANY BY A NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF A AND F. THINK MEDIA COALITION THE REPRESENTS. NEARLY A HUNDRED OUTLETS FROM ACROSS THE STATE -- WE'RE HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. FOR THE GOVERNOR'S. THIRTY MILLION RECOMMENDED AUGMENTATION AND CONSIDER EXPANDING THAT BY SIX MILLION. WHILE GOVERNOR BROWN'S BUDGET MADE HISTORY IN THE INVESTMENT ON THE CENSUS IT REALLY LEFT. MEDIA SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERFUNDED IN ORDER TO HAVE A SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGN AS WE ALL KNOW IN A STATE AS LARGE AS CALIFORNIA WE NEED A ROBUST CAMPAIGN. AND WE THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR'S RECOMMENDATION MAKES SENSE. I THINK MEDIA PRINT TV RADIO DIGITAL WILL BE CENTRAL. TO ACCOMPLISHING A COMPLETE COUNT PARTICULARLY IN HARD TO COUNT POPULATIONS ALL ACROSS THE STATE. SO WE ARE HERE TO RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND THE YOU CONSIDER A SMALL AUGMENTATION TO THE GOVERNOR'S. THIRTY MILLION OUR RECOMMENDATION BY SIX MILLION DOLLARS THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS JULIE SNYDER REPRESENTING HOUSING CALIFORNIA WE ARE HERE TO STRONGLY SUPPORT THE REQUEST BY THE CENSUS POLICY ADVOCACY NETWORK. FOR AN ADDITIONAL NINETY THREE POINT FOUR MILLION TO ALLOW CBO'S TO REACH THEIR HARD TO KIND HELP CLIENTS AS WELL AS OTHER COMMUNITY MEMBERS. HOUSING CALIFORNIA JOINS SEE POUND EARLY LAST YEAR TO PROVIDE THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE UNSTABLE HOUSE OR ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS -- SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT FACE AN ACCURATE COUNT OF CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS INCLUDE THEIR LACK OF A FIXED ADDRESS THEIR SEVERE LACK OF ACCESS TO THE INTERNET. AS WELL AS A WARINESS OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS OF BEST PRACTICES FOR REACHING THAT WOULD INCLUDE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HIRING AND NUMERATORS WHO HAVE LIVED EXPERIENCE. AND CAN CUT THROUGH THIS MISTRUST OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WE ARE NOT CONFIDENT HOWEVER THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL TAKE THAT STEP -- ONE MORE THING IS THAT AN ACCURATE COUNT DETERMINES OUR STATE'S ALLOTMENT OF HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHERS AS WELL AS NUMEROUS OTHER HOUSING RESOURCES -- THAT ARE VERY VALUABLE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING ON MODEST BUDGET -- SO REALLY THE STATE INVESTMENT IN CBO OUT REACHES FROM OUR% PERSPECTIVE A CLEAR STRATEGY FOR HELPING TO ADDRESS OUR MOUTHS OF HOUSING CRISIS.

I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA VOTE PROJECT TO JESS TRIBAL ART WHICH FUNDING FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS. CALIFORNIA TRIBAL COMMUNITIES HAVE SLIPPED THROUGH THE CRACKS IN ERASURE IMPAIR OF AN AFFAIR ACCOUNT OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE'S. OF THE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR POINT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS DEDICATED DISENTIS AT RISK BUDGET. ONLY POINT 2% OF THE BUDGET AT THE A LITTLE OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO TRIBES. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S HOME TO THE SECOND HIGHEST NUMBER A FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES IN THE US A HUNDRED AND TEN TO BE EXACT. COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE NATION CALIFORNIA HAS THE LARGEST POPULATION OVER SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE. WERE DONE IF I AS AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA NATIVE ALONE OR IN COMBINATION WITH ANOTHER RACE. OF THESE ONE HUNDRED AND TEN TRIBES IN CALIFORNIA FORTY TWO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR SENSES THAT REACH MINDING BASED ON THE HOUSING UNIT FORMULA. AND OF THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE MOST WILL ONLY RECEIVE AT THOUSAND OR TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED TO REACH THEIR CITIZENS. DUE TO LOW BUDGET RIGHT NOW ONLY TWELVE CAT TOOK TWELVE TRIBES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE OPTED IN AS OF MARCH EIGHTEENTH. NATIVE AMERICANS HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN THE MOST HARD TO COUNT POPULATION AND IN TWO THOUSAND TEN NATIVE AMERICANS SPECIFICALLY THOSE LIVING A TRIBAL LANDS. EXPERIENCE IN AN F. 5% UNDER COUNT WHICH IS TWICE AS HIGH AS A NEXT HARD TO COUNT POPULATION. AN ACCURATE COUNT MEANS DOLLARS FOR CENSUS -- THEIR DIFFERENT PROGRAMS LIKE TENNIS CHIP WAY. THERE'S STILL TIME TO CORRECT THIS WE BUILD OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY STATE COMMITTEES LICENSES AS WELL SENATE AND ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEES TO CORRECT THIS DRASTIC UNDERFUNDING AN INCREASE FUNDING TO EACH TRIBE BY 4100%. WE ASK THAT THE MINIMUM AMOUNT PROVIDED TO EACH TRIBE IS FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS REGARDLESS OF TRIBAL POPULATION SIZE WE CANNOT AFFORD TO NOT COUNT CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLES AND WE CAN'T BE COMPLICIT IN THE ERASURE OF CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLES THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE AND I'M SURE. WE'RE WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT -- I'M SURE YOU STARTED TO BUT IT IS A MATTER OF MORE RESOURCES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I JUST WANT TO REMIND EVERYBODY WE GIVING TWO MINUTES -- MAX THANK YOU VERY AWAY I'LL BE QUICKER THAN THAT HOW ABOUT THAT. MY NAME IS REALLY DOESN'T MEAN THE NEXT WEEK GETS MORE TIME. WHAT WE'RE PART OF A COALITION MY NAME IS REGINA BROWN WILSON AND I AM THAT CHAIR WELL THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ACTUALLY RIGHT NOW? OF CALIFORNIA BLACK MEDIA ON ONE OF WE JUST WANTED BASICALLY KNOWLEDGE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S -- PROPOSED -- ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND THE FUNDING THAT THE CENSUS OFFICE RECOGNIZE - TO PUT INTO ON ETHNIC MEDIA WE YOU KNOW COMPLETELY SUPPORT THAT -- WE KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF ETHNIC MEDIA -- WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT CRISIS COMMUNICATIONS THAT YOU TALK ABOUT THAT THE NEGATIVE INFORMATION THAT MAY COME OUT -- THAT'S OUR MEDIA OUTLETS WHAT THEY DO IS THEY ARE ABLE TO VET INFORMATION MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET PROPER INFORMATION OUT TO THE COMMUNITY. AND SO WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS ALSO HED IN REGARD IS HOW WE LOOK AT THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THEY COME AND THEY LEAN ON THE SAME. MEDIA OUTLETS TO HELP DISTRIBUTE AND PUSH OUT INFORMATION SO WE WANT TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS A VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND WE HOPE THAT YOU GUYS WILL CONTINUE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS PATRICIA BUCHANAN AND I REPRESENT THE TELEMUNDO STATION GROUP -- SO THE TIMER TO STATIONS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE KNOW THAT THE LATINO POPULATION IS IN A PART OF IT OF THE ETHNIC MEDIA COUNT COALITION AS WELL. AND AND I'M HERE TO BASICALLY SAY THAT -- WE NEED TO EDUCATE AND ENGAGE -- THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY AND THIS IS A CRITICAL TIME AND WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF FEAR IN THE COMMUNITY AND EXACTLY TO THAT POINT -- WE HAVE A A NEWS ORGANIZATION AND NEWS SOURCES THAT ARE VERY TRUSTED IN THE COMMUNITY AND AND THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY DEFINITELY NEEDS TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SENSES. AND ALSO NEEDS TO KNOW -- EXACTLY WHAT CRITICAL RESOURCES THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY -- THAT ARE AFFECTING THEIR LIVES SIMILAR TO THE THE FIRST -- FIVE AND ALSO SOME OF THE HEALTHCARE RESOURCES THAT THEY'RE USING AND THE FUNDING IF WE DON'T GET THEM COUNTED THEN THEY WON'T HAVE THE FUNDING IN THE FUTURE. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S DRIVEN HOME AND THAT'S YOU KNOW A WE SUPPORT -- ALL OF THE EFFORTS ON THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS SIDE BUT WE DO NEED THAT THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR THE MEDIA SERVICES PLUS THE ADDITIONAL -- SIX MILLION THAT WE'VE ASKED FOR AND IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THOSE GOALS THANK YOU. LIKE. IS IF WE DON'T HAVE -- ON THE GROUND AS WELL AS REINFORCEMENT FROM PARTICULARLY FROM OUR ETHNIC MEDIA -- IT JUST DOESN'T WORK AS WELL SO THE COMBINATION OF THE TWO IS REALLY REALLY POWERFUL AND ETHNIC MEDIA ALSO IN MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN HAVE BEEN. FOR THE COMMUNITIES NOT TRYING TO BE QUOTE UNQUOTE NEUTRAL. ADVOCATE FOR A COMMUNITY THAT PUTS YOU IN A HIGHER PLACE OF TRUST. AND RESPECT SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH RUN AT THE LIMóN FOR ALL THAT YOU DO. MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS KELLY GROWTH THAT'S NEXT IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE SENSES POLICY ADVOCACY NETWORK REQUEST FOR AN ADDITIONAL NINETY THREE POINT FOUR MILLION TO ENSURE A COMPLETE COUNT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS SERGEANT SAYING I AM A PART OF THE CBO CHICANO MOVEMENT -- AND I'M ACTUALLY A MEMBER OF SENATOR NIELSEN'S DISTRICT. JEFF TODD IN OCOEE GOT ABOUT GOT A I HAVE. A TON OR NOT THE BOSS ON THE SOME JOB IF IT OPEN UP NEW COFFEE BUT I LIKE THAT. IF SOMEONE IS SPEAKING TO YOU AND YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE THAT THEY'RE USING THEN IT DOESN'T FEEL VERY GOOD. THIS IS HOW MANY OF MY PIN JABI COMMUNITY MEMBERS FEEL WHEN THEY ARE ENGAGING WITH GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES OR TRYING TO UNDERSTAND ANY SORT OF DOCUMENTATIONS. BUT JABI IS THE TENTH MOST SPOKEN LANGUAGE IN CALIFORNIA AND AT THE SAME TIME NEARLY 40% OF OUR COMMUNITY HAS LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY. THEREFORE WE ARE LACKING THE RESOURCES THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO CONDUCT OUR DAILY LIVES NOW THE CENSUS IS A WAY FOR OUR COMMUNITY TO GET MORE RESOURCES. HOWEVER IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THEY HAVE TO NAVIGATE THE SENSES IN A LANGUAGE THAT HOW MANY MEMBERS OF MY COMMUNITY DON'T UNDERSTAND. AND SO IT'S WHAT WE ARE ADVOCATING FOR IS MORE LANGUAGE RESOURCES IN PUNJAB B. AND OTHER UNDER REPRESENTED LANGUAGES AND SO WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE IS. ONE TRUSTED MESSAGING -- SO EASY TO UNDERSTAND MESSAGING THAT'S GIVEN BY TRUSTED MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY -- SPECIFICALLY ETHNIC MEDIA FOR INSTANCE RADIO AND NEWSPAPER SECOND WOULD BE MORE WRITTEN LANGUAGE RESOURCES THAT COMMUNITY MEMBERS CAN TURN TO IF THEY WANT TO LEARN ABOUT OR UNDERSTAND THE SENSE IS BETTER. THIRD WOULD BE DIRECTLY WORKING AND PARTNERING WITH COMMUNITY GROUPS WHO CAN PROVIDE THESE TRANSLATIONS WHO CAN HELP WITHOUT REACH EFFORTS AND WHO CAN WORK DIRECTLY WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS. AND EVENTUALLY DOWN THE LINE WE WOULD NEED TO HIRE AN NUMERATORS WHO ARE BY LEGALLY PROFICIENT AND BEEN JABI AND IN ENGLISH I HOPE THAT WE CAN. BE INVEST IN ALL OF THESE EFFORTS AND BY DOING SO WE REACH OUR HIGH TO COUNT COMMUNITIES AND ENSURE AN EQUITABLE SENSES TWENTY TWENTY THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- JUST IN TIME.

THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT I TO DO AN EVALUATION OF AND IT BASICALLY A BUSINESS PROCESS REVIEW OF THEIR PRO RATA FUNDED SERVICES. I'M TO SEE IF THEY COULD IDENTIFY ANY EFFICIENCIES AND THIS WAS REALLY RELATED TO SOME LONGSTANDING CONCERNS ABOUT -- DEFENDING ATTORNEYS PERRETTA SERVICES. I'M ONLY ONE OF A WHOLE SERIES OF REVIEWS SO THAT'S PRESS RELATIVELY SMALL PORTION OF THAT OF THE PLANNED REVIEWS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED -- THE SECOND IS THAT WE HAVE SOME WORK LOAD -- CONCERNS AND WE THINK IT'S AN PLACES THAT WORK WITH JUST OCCASIONS ARE INSUFFICIENT OF FOR EXAMPLE WITH REGULATION UNIT -- CURRENTLY THE DEPARTMENT DOES DO SOME WORK ASSOCIATED WITH -- REVIEWING REGULATIONS THAT PORTS AND BUREAUS HAVE IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THERE AT WORK LOAD -- BASICALLY TOOK INTO ACCOUNT THAT WORK WITH THAT THEY'RE ALREADY DOING BASED ON REGULATION REVIEW UPSET WHEN EXAMPLE WE HAVE -- SOME OTHER EXAMPLES AS WELL. EXPLAIN THAT JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE IS MORE. PRO READ A THE YEAH HI YEAH SO. ESSENTIALLY DCA PROVIDES A VARIETY OF ADMINISTRATIVE SORT OF CENTRALIZED SERVICES TO THE BOARDS IN BUREAUS WITHIN THAT DEPARTMENT THERE ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN BOARDS AND BUREAUS. AND THOSE INCLUDE THINGS LIKE I COUNTING SERVICES HR SERVICES -- LEGAL SERVICES TODAY HAVE ATTORNEYS -- BUT THEY ALSO DO THINGS LIKE THERE'S AN INVESTIGATION UNIT THAT DOES NOT HAVE SWORN OFFICERS AND THOSE OFFICERS CAN DO USE INVESTIGATIONS IN TERMS OF ENFORCEMENT CASES. SO SOME OF THEIR FUNCTIONS ARE FUNDED BASED ON USAGE SO FOR EXAMPLE I DO WHY THE INVESTIGATIONS -- THOSE THOSE FOLKS WHO GO OUT AND DO THOSE -- DESTINATION FOR SWORN OFFICERS THEY CHARGE THE INDIVIDUAL BOARDS IN BUREAUS BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THEY SPEND ON THOSE INVESTIGATIONS. OTHER SERVICES ARE OF FUNDED DIFFERENTLY FOR EXAMPLE THERE LEGAL SERVICES I THOSE ARE FINE DID BASED ON PRO RATA SO ESSENTIALLY WHAT THE DEPARTMENT DOES IS IT LOOKS AT THE LEGAL SERVICES THE COST OF THOSE LEGAL SERVICES. AND THEN ALLOCATED OUT ON TO THE BOARD ANDYOUR IS BASED ON HOW MANY POSITIONS EACH BOARDING BUREAU HAS NOT BASED ON HOW MUCH THE USE LEGAL SERVICES. TO CURRENTLY THEY'RE NOT TRACKING FOR EXAMPLE THE NUMBER OF HOURS THAT THEIR ATTORNEYS ARE SPENDING ON EACH BOARD IN BUREAUS WORKLOAD. I SAW IN THE PAST THERE WAS SOME CONCERN. THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME CROSS SUBSIDIZATION FOR EXAMPLE THAT SOME OF THE BOARDS -- OR BUREAUS THAT ARE LARGER -- MIGHT PURPORT THEY'RE PAYING PROPORTIONALLY MORE FOR THOSE SERVICES NAY MY UP USING PROPORTIONALLY MORE THAT WAS A CONCERN THAT'S COME UP IN THE PAST. ON THAT WAS. THIS I REQUEST THAT THE DEPARTMENT TO THIS EVALUATION AND LOOK FOR EFFICIENCIES -- AND SO THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE'RE HOPING TO UNDERSTAND THROUGH THESE REVIEWS AND THEY STARTED THEM AND THEY DID THE FIRST ONE WHICH ACTUALLY WAS ON THE REGULATIONS. UNIT WHICH IS ONE PIECE OF THEIR ATTORNEY WORKLOAD -- BUT THEY HAVE SEVERAL MORE THAT ARE PLANNED AND WE EXPECT TO GET IN THE COMING. YEARS OR SOUR I THINK THERE ARE SOME THAT THAT WE DON'T HAVE DEFINITIVE DATE TIME. THE HELP YES THANK YOU ANYTHING THAT YOU WANNA. RESPOND -- ADD TO THAT. MADAM CHAIR DENNIS KHUSRO DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATION OF THE DEPARTMENT -- SO IT'S SIMPLY WANTED SPEAKER AS IT RELATES TO TWO ISSUES. ONE OF THE CMP'S. IT WAS NEVER THE DEPARTMENT INTENTION TO GET IN FRONT OF THE LEGISLATURE -- WE ALWAYS IF YOU LOOK AT THE BUDGET LANGUAGE THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE BUDGET LANGUAGE THAT -- PROHIBITED THE DEPARTMENT FROM -- REQUESTING ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION -- OR ARE FUNDING THE SO THE REGULATION PIECE WAS -- SOMETHING THAT IS HAS BEEN THE BIGGEST CRITICISM OF DCA WHEN WE GET. FEEDBACK FROM OUR BOARDS IN BUREAUS IN TERMS OF THE TIMELINESS -- I HAVE MY DEPUTY THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE LEGAL AFFAIRS DIVISION THAT COULD SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE TO THIS. BUT THIS IS A DIRECT RESPONSE TO TRY TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF THE BOARDS -- THEY THEY HAVE ADDITIONAL NEEDS AND THIS REQUEST IS -- MEANT TO MEET THOSE NEEDS IN ADDITION TO AS MY COLLEAGUE JANICE MENTIONED. TO ME THAT THEY NEED TO AT THE NEEDS OF AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY EIGHT THAT WAS PASSED LAST YEAR -- SO SIMPLY TRYING TO BE RESPONSIVE AS THE DEPARTMENT IS A FOCUS ON CONSUMER AFFAIRS IT IS CHALLENGING FOR THE DEPARTMENT -- TO SIMPLY WAIT WHEN THERE MIGHT BE ESSENTIAL NEEDS TO ENSURE OUR CONSUMER MANDATE -- AND BY DOING SO AND WAITING TWO YEARS UNTIL THE OLD OLD -- TO THE CM PROCESS IS COMPLETED. WE THINK THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT CHALLENGING -- SO SIMPLY WANTED TO MAKE THAT COMMENT. THANK YOU. DANIEL I'M THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF ADMINISTRATION AT THE CA I ALSO WANTED TO ASK THOUGH -- DENNIS'S REMARKS AND ALSO POINT OUT THAT OUR PERRETTA SERVICES ARE LIMITED TERM SO GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS. THAT OUR BOARDS EMBARRASSED HAVE RAISED AND WE WOULD THEN HAVE TO POSITION TO EXPIRE WE CAN REVISIT THEM WITH THE LEGISLATURE. IN A TWO YEAR OR THREE YEAR FASHION AS PROPOSED BY THE BUDGET [inaudible] YES. IT'S NOT A PART OF FINANCE -- THE RICHEST IN RESPONSE TO THE IS CONCERNS WE JUST ONE THING THAT WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE I REQUEST AS PROPOSED. AS THE DEPARTMENT MENTIONED ALREADY WE JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE PROVIDER RESOURCES -- FOR THE DEDICATED REGULATIONS UNIT AND THE COUNTY OF THE SCHOOL SERVICES ARE THAT'S ON A LIMITED TERM BASIS. THIS IS GOING TO PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD DRESS MORE -- IMMEDIATE ISSUES AND WORKLOAD ISSUE A INCREASES WHILE STILL ALLOWING FOR SUBSEQUENT -- EVALUATION OF THE ONGOING RESOURCE NEEDS BASED ON THESE ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT REVIEWS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE -- WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FISCALE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED THE DEPARTMENT'S PROCESS SEES AND TO YOUR LIMITED TERM RESOURCES ARE NECESSARY -- TO HELP THEM ADDRESS THE INCREASED WORKLOAD THAT THEY'RE EXPERIENCING -- ALSO SUPPORTIVE OF THE REGULATIONS UNIT REQUEST -- BECAUSE THERE'S A CAPACITY ISSUE THE EXISTING STAFF SIMPLY RIGHT NOW SIMPLY CAN'T ADDRESS THE SIGNIFICANT VOLUME OF REGULATIONS -- INCLUDING THE INCREASE WORKING FROM AB -- TWENTY ONE THIRTY EIGHT THIS DEDICATED UNIT ONE PROVE -- OF THE QUALITY. OF AND REDUCE THE EXISTING TALENTS OF THE REGULATIONS AND US DEPARTMENT MENTION THIS HAS BEEN A CONCERN OF THE FOURTH. YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN A CONCERN OF THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL. AND THIS IS ALSO THE PROVIDER WORKING GROUP'S HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR THEIR THEIR ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT REVIEWS. AND WE WOULDN'T KNOW THAT -- ESTABLISHING THE DEDICATED UNIT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS -- IN THE MARCH FIRST TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN REPORT FROM THE FIRST COMPLETED -- OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT REVIEW [inaudible] NO -- PUBLIC COMMENT HEARING NONE [inaudible] OKAY -- THERE WERE HOLDEN OKAY STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS TO HOLD OFFICE THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE [inaudible] ISSUE TWENTY THE END OF THE ISSUE YES SIR. I'M GOOD AFTERNOON. MADAM CHAIR AND SENATOR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM DOCTOR MORRIS IM THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER. OF THE CALIFORNIA BORDER REYES TO NURSING INTO MY LEFT WE HAVE. STACEY BERMAN THIS IS AN EXECUTIVE OFFICER. AND CRISTINA SPRING DEPUTY CHIEF LICENSING. COMMITTEE. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALLOWING THE BOARD OPPORTUNITY TO DRESS.

THE BOARD IMPLEMENTS AND ENFORCES A NURSING PRACTICE ACT IS LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO NURSING EDUCATION. LICENSURE PRACTICE AND DISCIPLINE. THE BAR REGULATES OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND LICENSEES IN CALIFORNIA HIS RESPONSE FOR SAID IN THE EDUCATIONAL STANDARDS FOR REGISTERED NURSES. NURSE MIDWIVES IN OTHER ADVANCED PRACTICE NURSES. WE ALSO OVERSEE A HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE NURSING PROGRAMS AND APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED EDUCATE. PROVIDERS CONTINUING EDUCATION PROVIDERS. DOING THE BOARDS LAST BUDGET HEARING THERE ARE SEVERAL ISSUES REYES REGARDING DIVORCED INTERNAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS. PROCESSES. LAUGHING MATTERS AND THE ABILITY TO RESPOND TO CONSUMERS IN A TIMELY MANNER. AS OF TODAY I'M PROUD TO SAY. ME THOSE MATTERS HAVE BEEN RESOLVED AND ARE UPDATED. THE BOARD STAFF HAS WORKED EXTENSIVELY BY RESPONDING TO THE FOLLOWING PROGRAMMATIC AND OPERATIONAL CHANGES. WE'LL MODERNIZE OUR PROCESS IS BASED ON SEVERAL INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL AUDITS. THE BOARD HAS WORKED WITH PCA'S FISCAL DEPARTMENT AND A SOLID OCCUPATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT TEAM TO REVIEW THE BOARD'S PROBLEMATIC NEEDS AND AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT. THE BOARD IS ALSO INCREASE ITS FEES OF HIS CONSTITUENTS. IN ORDER TO MEET THE OPERATIONAL DEMANDS. OF THE BOARD TO BETTER SERVE THE PUBLIC. AND FOR THE THIRD STRAIGHT YEAR SENATOR ON BURKE. WE HAVE CREATED THIS SYNERGY WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS -- BY. EMAIL IN THEM A A A CUSTOMER SERVICE QUESTIONNAIRE. AND THIS INCLUDES NOT ONLY OUR LICENSEES BUT ALSO HOSPITALS AND OTHER COMMUNITY PARTNERS. AND WE WE USED THE CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK. I'M FROM THE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRES TO CONTINUE TO MAKE CHANGES AS NEEDED -- INTERFACING AND LEVERAGES. POINT [inaudible] CONSTANTLY. THAT'S HOW WE MEASURE THE OUTCOME. YEAH. YES AND SO HOWEVER. HOWEVER THOSE ARE ON THEIR ITEMS ADDRESS AND I'M IN FRONT OF YOU AND THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL. THAT THAT THE THE STILL ARE REMAINS MATTERS OF CONCERN. SO BUT SO THE COLLECTIVE INPUT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ALEJO. THE BOARD FEELS THAT THE SIXTY SEVEN POSITION THE REQUESTED NOT ONLY ALLOW US THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVE OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE. BUT ALSO BETTER PROTECT THE PUBLIC AND RESPOND TO MATTERS OF CONCERNED. MUCH SOONER THAN LATER. AGAIN ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD MEMBERS THE ENTIRE BE ARE IN STAFF THAT ARE LOOKING -- ADDRESS TODAY. AND THE STAFF IS THAT BEFORE YOU TODAY WE ASKED RESPECTFULLY FOR YOUR SUPPORT -- IN NOW BUDGET CHANGE COMPOSED [inaudible] THANK YOU. NO CONCERN FOR THE PROPOSAL FINAL -- LIKE TO ASK. THIS IS A VERY DRAMATIC INCREASE. THE SIXTY SEVEN POSITION. CAN YOU DEFINE DRAMATIC SOME AND I'M JUST I'M I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHY THIS. IT LOOKS SEVEN FOR US YES RIGHT COULD NOT HAVE HAD IT AND THEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PAST. HISTORY IS IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU ASK. FOR IN THE PAST BUT SIXTY SEVEN IS A I MEAN. WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT FIFTY YEAH AND THE YOU KNOW INNOVATION TECHNOLOGY NAY ASKING. FOR SIXTY SEVEN HI HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS. BIG JUMP IF I MAY GIVE YOU ME MY HUMBLE OPINION THE NOW WILL OF POINT TO STAFF SO THEY CAN GIVE YOU MORE. DETAIL. RESPECTFULLY THE BOARD AGAIN WE SEE WE OVERSEE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND LICENSEES. PERHAPS THE LARGEST HILL IN ART BOARDS IN THE UNITED STATES AND THAT THE BOARD HAS NOT. YET INCREASES FEES IN OVER TEN YEARS. ALSO WITHIN TEN YEARS WE'VE SEEN OUR NUMBER OF LICENSEE POPULATION ALMOST DOUBLE. THEN SO. WHAT THAT LITTLE DRAMATIC CHANGES IS ALSO CREATED MORE DEMAND -- ON THE BOARD TO TO TO RESPOND TO THE CONSUMER NEEDS. ON SOME ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND WE HAVE -- SUBMITTED PROPOSALS AND THE PAST THAT HAVEN'T BEEN COMPLETELY SUCCESSFUL -- AND WE WERE ALSO MADE AWARE THAT YOU KNOW WE DIDN'T HAVE NECESSARILY BE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT FIVE AND A NUMBER OF POSITIONS THAT HAVE BEEN REQUESTED. AND SO WE DID HAVE A FIAT IT'S APPROXIMATELY FOUR YEARS AGO. ON THE BOARD VOTED -- TO INCREASE THE MAJORITY OF THE FEES THAT THE BOARD OF CHARGES AND THEY WERE PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE SO WE HAVE LOOKED AT ALL OF OUR VARIOUS PROCESSES. IN ORDER TO DETERMINE -- WHERE WE NEEDED TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS IN ORDER TO IMPROVE OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE AS WELL AS OUR ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS? DID YOU ON A BREAKDOWN OF THE THE POSITIONS AS WELL SO SIXTY SEVEN DOES SOUND LIKE A LARGE NUMBER NO I I HAVE THEM WELL WELL IT'S NOT ALL BRAND NEW POSITIONS. SO THEY'RE MAKING SIXTEEN POSITIONS THAT WERE LIMITED TERM BCP POSITIONS. I'M A COUPLE OF BUDGET CYCLES AGO PERMANENT SO IT'S PERMANENT FUNDING FOR THOSE POSITIONS THAT ALREADY EXIST WITH THE BOARD. THERE ARE TWENTY EIGHT LIMITED TERM POSITIONS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE BCP THAT WE WILL EVALUATE OUR PROCESSES DETERMINE IF -- WE HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES IF WE NEED TO MAKE ANY OF THOSE PERMANENT THEN WE WILL COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE TO LOOK TO MAKE SOME OF THOSE ARE ALL OF THOSE IF NEEDED. PERMANENT WHICH OF REMAINS TWENTY THREE POSITIONS ARE ACTUALLY ALL THAT THE BOARD IS GETTING PERMANENT FULL TIME POSITIONS. FOR ARE SEEKING. I'M SURE YES -- I JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT IN THE PAST COUPLE YEARS THE BOARD HAS REQUESTED -- ADDITIONAL RESOURCES BUT WE ONLY APPROVE THEM ON A LIMITED TERM BASIS BECAUSE OF THAT THE IT. THE FUNDING ISSUE WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT. ON GOING THANK YOU [inaudible] THE THAT. IS A PART OF MY QUESTION IS WHEN YOU SAID THE A PROPOSED HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL YOU MEAN YOU HAVEN'T GOT THE POSITIONS YOU ASKED FOR OR YOU DID GET HIM AND THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT THE WAY YOU'D HOPED. WE DID NOT GET ALL OF THE POSITIONS THAT WE ASKED. FOR SO IS THERE OF SOME SORT OF CONTINUING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS SO THAT WE CAN NO IF WE APPROVE THE SIXTY SEVEN POSITIONS THAT THE BACKLOG IS COMING DOWN. THE RATES COMING DOWN THAT KIND OF STUFF. SO IT. AS THE B. C. B. STANDS RIGHT NOW THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE THAT BU WE'LL BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE INFORMATION THAT THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT NEED IN ORDER TO DO THAT. OKAY BUT WILL LOOK TO THE LA ALL -- SO THAT WE CAN. SERVE ED ACCOUNTABILITY. OKAY -- JUST ONE MORE QUESTION THIS [inaudible] YEAH. IS THE UP THE WORKLOAD DURING WORK LOAD I HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH MORE COMPLAINTS. OR IS THAT. SORT OF NORMAL IT'S A NORMAL LEVEL. YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT AN DID YOU SEE AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LICENSES. SEC SO WE LICENSE LICENSEES LICENSEES. SURE SO SO OUR COMPLAINT WORK THAT HAS GONE UP -- IT'S NOT AS DRAMATIC ANYMORE THE THE INCREASE IN THE COMPLAINT WORKLOAD -- HOWEVER WE'RE PROJECTED TO RECEIVE OVER TEN THOUSAND COMPLAINTS THIS YEAR WE HAD APPROXIMATELY NINETY SEVEN HUNDRED COMPLAINTS LAST YEAR BUT AS THE NUMBER OF LICENSEES INCREASES. IT'S SORT OF EXPECTED THAT THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS WILL ALSO GO UP AS WELL [inaudible] OKAY. OKAY A PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS. OKAY HEARING NONE. JUST ONE THING I WANTED TO ADD ON THE REPORTING -- SO HISTORICALLY THE DEPARTMENT CONSUMER AFFAIRS HAS DONE REPORTING ON THEIR LICENSE TIME LINES AS WELL AS THEIR ENFORCEMENT TIME LINES AND THERE'S BEEN. AND THAT'S BEEN INCLUDED AS PART OF THE BUDGET I UNDERSTAND THERE BEEN SOME CHALLENGES WITH THEIR SORT OF MOVED TO BREEZE AND SOME OF THE ENTITIES HAVEN'T HAVEN'T. BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE ALL OF THAT BUT I BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS HISTORICALLY PROVIDED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND I THINK IS ABSOLUTELY REASONABLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO REQUEST ON IN THE FUTURE AS WELL. ADDITIONALLY ADDITION YOU KNOW IF THERE'S INTEREST IN ADDITIONAL TYPES OF REPORTING CERTAINLY THAT -- THAT. THE BOARD COULD THAT COULD CERTAINLY WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND AND OUR OFFICE TO THINK BOUT OTHER KINDS OF THINGS THAT COULD BE HELPFUL FOR EXAMPLE HISTORICALLY -- LAST FEW YEARS THE BOARD HAS HAD SOME ISSUES WITH YOU KNOW CALLS BEING DROPPED THOSE KINDS OF THINGS IF THERE ARE METRICS LIKE THAT DAY OUR PARTICULAR INTEREST TO THE LEGISLATURE. I'M CERTAINLY WOULD BE REASONABLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO TO ASK THE BOARD TO A REPORT ON THOSE OUTCOMES TO ENSURE THAT I'M WHATEVER KINDS OF OUTCOME MEASURES LEGISLATURE'S MOST INTERESTED IN. ARE REALLY BEING ACHIEVED THROUGH THESE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. OKAY. GREAT -- ALL RIGHT THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO HOLD OPEN -- APPRECIATE VERY MUCH YOUR WORK THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE SO WE'LL WE'LL. WE'LL ASK YOU TO TELL US WHAT METRIC YOU THINK IS REASONABLE FOR US TO ASSESS SO THAT. NO WHETHER IT'S YOU KNOW BI MONTHLY REPORTING WHATEVER IT IS WE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN SEEING WHAT PROGRESS IS BEING MADE. ASSUMING THAT THE SIXTY SEVEN POSITIONS. BOB PART OF YOUR OKAY YES. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NOW WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL THIS IS OUR LAST. THE LAST ITEM ON THE AGENDA GOOD AFTERNOON I I ALMOST SAY GOOD MORNING [inaudible] WELCOME. Q.. GOOD AFTERNOON. MADAM CHAIR. NUMBER -- I'M AND BOUND CRAWFORD I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL. THANKS FOR PUTTING OUR BUDGET ON THE COMMITTEE AGENDA. FOR SENATE SUB. FOR I'M HERE TODAY WITH THE MY STAFF DIRECTOR. OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS CHRISTIAN MARGOLIS. WE'RE GRATEFUL TO GOVERNOR NEW SAM FOR HIS JANUARY PROPOSAL AS AS THE TEN MILLION ON GOING INCREASED TO OUR BUDGET FOR THE FISCAL YEAR. NINETEEN TWENTY LAST WEEK OUR BUDGET WAS HEARD IN THE ASSEMBLY AND BUDGET SO FOR COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE OTED TO LEAVE OUR ITEM OPEN. THE ENTIRE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL GRANT PORTFOLIO IS FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO ARTS AND CULTURE THAT'S RELEVANT AND RESPONSIVE TO THEM. HOWEVER WE HAVE SOME PROGRAMS THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES HAVE ACCESS TO ARTS AND CULTURE. IN OUR FUNDING YEARS SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WE MADE THE COMMITMENT TO ALLOCATE APPROXIMATELY SIX POINT SIX MILLION. TO FIND SPECIFIC UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES LOW INCOME AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AM SOME OF THESE ARE A LOCAL IMPACT WHICH AT THAT PROGRAM SUPPORTS COMMUNITY DRIVEN ARTS PROJECTS FOR SMALL TO MID SIZED ARTS ORGANIZATIONS. CULTURAL PATHWAYS -- THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES TWO YEARS OF OPERATING SUPPORT AND A HOST OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES TO SMALL -- NEW AN EMERGENCY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE ROOTED IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. RECENT IMMIGRANT REFUGEE COMMUNITIES AND TRIBAL OR INDIGENOUS AND GROUPS. WE HAVE A VETERANS IN THE ARTS -- THE GRANT [inaudible] ARENA WHERE. THIS PROGRAM IS ROOTED IN OUR COUNCIL'S DESIRE TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS AND IMPROVE THE LIVES. OF CALIFORNIA'S VETERANS THROUGH THE ARTS WE ALSO FIND A VETERANS IN THE ARTS I MEAN I'VE READ A RE ENTRY THROUGH THE ARTS. PROGRAM. WHICH IS SUPPORT HIGH QUALITY ARTS PROGRAMS FOR PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN CONVICTED OF A CRIMINAL OFFENSE. AND HAVE SERVED THEIR TIME IN CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS. ALSO JUMPSTART'S PROGRAM. HEY ADAM THIS IS JUMPSTART'S AS A HIGH QUALITY ARTS EDUCATION AN ARTIST IN RESIDENCE PROGRAM. FOR YOUTH ENGAGED IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM I INCLUDE THIS CITY -- TO WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT INCARCERATION DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS PEOPLE OF COLOR IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. SO IT SOUNDS. IT BELONGS IN THIS GROUP AS DOES ARTS EDUCATION. EXPOSURE WHICH PRIMARILY SERVES TITLE ONE SCHOOLS. WHERE MOST STUDENT ATTENDEES -- ARE UNDERSERVED IN TERMS OF THEIR ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY ARTS EDUCATION ART SOME EXPERIENCES AND ARTS EDUCATION. I AM THIS PARTICULAR GRANT. PROGRAM THAT SUPPORTS AT TENDONS TWO PERFORMANCES AND EXHIBITS FOR STUDENTS WHO HAVE LIMITED ASK ACCESS TO THOSE EXPERIENCES. RIGHT -- KRISTIN HERE SO THAT WE CAN. BOTH SHE'S PART OF MY COLLECTED BRAIN AS IT WERE AND WE CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE [inaudible] OKAY. GET A RAISE ANY CONCERNS FINANCE [inaudible] CALL. JUST CLICK UP. I BELIEVE SUPPORT THIS WANT ONE OF OUR CHALLENGES IT. CONSTITUENTS SAY YOU KNOW IF WE JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE ARTS BUDGET THAT OUR STATE BUDGET CRISIS WOULD BE RESOLVED OR ANY STATE DEFICIT WOULD BE RESOLVED WE ALL KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT ACCURATE. IN TERMS. THE OR SHIP FUNDING IT'S VERY VERY SMALL -- WOULD BE USEFUL IS IF AND I SAY THIS EARLIER TODAY IF THERE WAS SOME SORT OF METRIC. IT'S JUST MY OBSERVATION THAT ARTS FOR EXAMPLE IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES AT ACTUALLY HAS. A BENEFIT NOT JUST TO THE PERSON WHO IS PARTICIPATING BUT HAS A BENEFIT TERMS OF POSITIVISM ALL KINDS OF THINGS AND AND THERE'S THERE'S OTHER. BENEFITS BESIDES TO THE INDIVIDUAL WHO IS PARTICIPATING SO TO THE EXTENT. TODAY TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT THINK THAT'S HELPFUL. IF THERE IS A WAY THAT'S THAT'S HELPFUL FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME TO EXPLAIN TO OUR CONSTITUENTS Y. TAXPAYERS ARE PROVIDING. TEN MILLION DOLLARS THOSE ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO US AS WELL. WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT WE ACTUALLY ARE PLANNING TO USE A GOOD PORTION OF THE FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED FOR EVALUATION -- AND THOSE WOULD CERTAINLY BE SHARED WITH EVERY MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION -- IN ADDITION WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A STRATEGIC STRATEGIC PLANNING FRAMEWORK PROCESS -- AND THAT IS REALLY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE WELL INFORMED OF WHAT THEY NEED IS IN IN EVERYONE'S DISTRICT AND SO WE PLAN ON REACHING OUT TO MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE. AS WELL AS EVERY AND EVERYONE ELSE IN THE GENERAL PUBLIC. I'M TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE NEEDS ARE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES -- I THINK THAT AND PROVIDED A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE AND HOW ARE OUTRAGE IS REALLY TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO THOSE -- AFFORDABLE IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN WE FOLLOW THE CENSUS RICHARDS -- QUESTIONS -- WE DID IN THE IN THE ASSEMBLY HEARING AS WELL AND AND WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON THOSE SAME POPULATIONS AND TRYING TO REACH EVERYONE -- AND TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT VALUE IS SO WE APPRECIATE THAT AND WE ARE DEFINITELY GOING TO WORK ON THAT AND SHARE THAT WITH INFORMATION WITH YOU THAT'S GREAT SO I'M FOR EXAMPLE CHILDREN WHO EXPERIENCED TRAUMA. ARE VERY HEALTHY LIKE YOURSELF. RIGHT IF THE HEALING PROCESS RIGHT EXACTLY SO YOU GONNA TELL US. WHAT NUMBERS WE CAN USE? TO BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THANK YOU SIR WE HAVE A LOT OF GOOD STORIES BUT THE NUMBERS ARE. FOUNDATION ABOUT [inaudible] I'M. I COULD I COULD SEE HERE. BY THE WAY THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR WORK I THINK ARTS ARE REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF I COMMUNITIES AND AND EDUCATION OVERALL -- THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT YOU HAVE YOUR TRYING TO SPREAD IT OUT MORRELL. I MEAN TO TO GIVE FIFTY SIX GRAMS. FOR A TOTAL OF FORTY FOUR HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THEY MIGHT GET NINETY NINE CENTS EACH RIGHT I MEAN. I'M JUST GETTING. THE POINT IS A HUNDRED THIRTY THREE GRANTS FOR ONE POINT NINE MILLION -- AND IT GOES ON AND ON AND ON SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS WHAT I HAVE SEEN IN IN MY DISTRICT AND IN OTHER AREAS IS. OBVIOUSLY THERE'S AN ENORMOUS NEED -- HOW DO WE FEEL THAT NEED WHAT'S THE STRATEGY TO FEEL THE NEED TO DO THAT YOU KNOW TAKE OUT AND? BE CREATIVE BOB THE KINDS OF ARTS THAT ARE NEEDED AD THAT CAN BE DONE IN OUR COMMUNITY SO. IT'S IT YOU KNOW I'D LIKE TO LEARN MORE WE DON'T HAVE TO DO IT ALL TODAY BUT WHAT'S A REAL STRATEGY TO USE OUR RESOURCES. IN THE BEST WAY -- WE HAVE FOR EXAMPLE IN AN RIGHT OUTSIDE OF MY DISTRICT BUT SERVING THE NEEDS OF MY DISTRICT. OF JUST A HANDFUL OF THEATERS. LIVE THEATERS AND THEY'RE REALLY SMALL BUT HOW DO WE ALLOW THEM TO WORK ONE THEATER IN PARTICULAR REPRESENTS -- DOES -- WORK IN THREE ETHNIC -- COMMUNITIES SO HOW DO WE USE A REGION MODEL A REGIONAL MODEL RIGHT -- OR SOMETHING THAT WE CAN TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE RESOURCES. OF THAT'S ONE QUESTION THE OTHER IS. LOOKING UP TO BUILD. AND NOT ONLY GIVE. YOU KNOW TWENTY THOUSAND HERE ARE FIVE THOUSAND THERE BUT HOW DO YOU BUILD AN INFRASTRUCTURE I MEAN OUR MAINSTREAM. QUOTE UNQUOTE YOU KNOW ARTS. THE BILL THE THE DOROTHY CHANDLER PAVILION THEY BUILD. THESE -- PROGRAMS THAT HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE BUT ACTUALLY. IN OVER THE MORTAR I MEAN RIGHT. THAT'S LEFT THERE SO YOU COULD SEE A A MUSEUM YOU. SEE THESE ARE PERMANENT THEY'RE NOT GOING AWAY AFTER THE FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR GRANT. SO. I'M INTERESTED IN HOW WE REALLY DO THAT YEAR AFTER YEAR AND NOT ONLY SPREAD -- THE MONEY TO YOU KNOW HUNDREDS OF GROUPS BUT REALLY BILL SOMETHING PERMANENT SO THOSE ARE JUST. TWO YOU CAN COMMENT TODAY BUT THAT'S WHAT I'M. I'M I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN I THINK YOU SHOULD GET MORE THAN TEN MILLION DOLLARS I REALLY DO I I JUST DON'T SEE HOW WE DO. ALL OF THIS GREAT WORK WITH TEN MILLION DOLLARS BUT I THINK IT WOULD COME WITH. A REAL PLAN RIGHT RIGHT BILL SOMETHING PERMANENT IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND NOT BE SUBJECT TO EVERY YEAR DO I GET I THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT'S JUST NOT GOING TO WORK ARE YOU WRITE IT SEE IT AND IT SEE IT WOULD SEEM AS IF IT WOULD MAKE THE WORK ON SUSTAINABLE. AND ONE BEING ABLE TO EVALUATE IN FACT ONE OF MY OUR PRIORITIES IS TO EVALUATE. THE IMPACT THAT WE HAVE ARE HAVING CURRENTLY IN HAVE HAD ON THE FIELD AND TO EVALUATE HOW WE ACTUALLY DO DISTURB -- BUTTE MONEY IN. CURRENT. CONTEMPORARY LANDSCAPE. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT NETWORKING OR AND YOU KNOW HOW HOW DO WE? HOW DO WE BECOME AS IMPACTFUL AS POSSIBLE ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE HAVE A PRETTY? ROBUST SYSTEM A NETWORK OF COUNTY ARTS COUNCILS. WE HAVE NAM ARTS COUNCILS THAT ARE THERE APPOINTED BY THE COUNTY BOARD ISSUE. WE FIND THEM. AND SO THERE ARE WELL VERSED IN WHAT THEY'RE REGION'S NEED. AND THAT'S AND AND THAT'S A NETWORK THAT WE ARE INCREASINGLY MAKING MORE ROBUST AND KEEP BETTER CONNECTED AND I'VE I WOULD LIKE. TO REINFORCE YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO. AND MAKE THEM MORE EVEN MORE EFFICIENT IN THEIR AREAS AND I DON'T KNOW HOW WE GET TO THE BRICK AND MORTAR PART USUALLY BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S ALL I'LL. LOT MORE RESOURCE BUT IF A COUNTY AND SEE WHAT RESOURCES ARE THERE AND WHERE THE NEED IS MAYBE THERE ARE BRICK AND MORTAR PLACES WHERE THEY CAN YOU KNOW FIGURE OUT THE RIGHT AT SOME. AND ON YOUR RIGHT THIS IS A LARGER CONVERSATION THAT I'D LOVE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE WITH YOU. I ALSO JUST LIKE TO MAKE ON ONE POINT IS THAT -- WE ALSO ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN. DESIGNATING CULTURAL DISTRICTS AND THIS IS A LEGISLATIVELY MANDATED PROGRAM -- AND WHILE THERE ISN'T A LOT OF MONEY THAT'S ATTACHED TO IT AT THIS POINT BECAUSE IT'S IN ITS FORMATIVE STAGE. IT'S ABOUT BRINGING PARTNERS TOGETHER SO SOME OF THOSE PARTNERS DO CERTAINLY INVOLVED BROKEN MARTYR. AND AND OTHER CORPORATE PARTNERSHIPS BUT HISTORICAL PARTNERSHIPS -- OUR PARTNERSHIP BRINGING IN CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO AND SO I THINK THOSE THAT'S ONE WAY THAT THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL AS A STATE WIDE ENTITY CAN REALLY HELP THE SMALLER ORGANIZATIONS. CURRENTLY WE FIGURE WE'LL FIND ABOUT 57% OF THE REQUESTS THAT COME IN FOR US AND IF YOU LOOK AT STATEWIDE IN TERMS OF NONPROFIT ARTS ORGANIZATION THERE'S ABOUT. ELEVEN THOUSAND WHICH MEANS WERE FINDING ABOUT 7% -- SO YES IT SEEMS LIKE A SMALL AMOUNT BUT EVERY SINGLE INCREMENTAL INCREASE TO OUR BUDGET SINCE WE HAD OUR DEVASTATING CUTS. IN TWO THOUSAND THREE HAS MADE A HUGE. HUGE DIFFERENCE AND WE BELIEVE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND SO WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THIS. OPPOSE TEN MILLION DOLLARS IT JUST YOU EXAMPLE NOW AND WITH THIS IS THE LA THEATRE COMPANY ON IN DOWNTOWN LA. I MEAN WHEN IT WAS RAINING HAD BUCKETS ALL OVER THE YEAH ALL OVER THE PLACE. AND HOW HOW DO YOU THREE WELCOME PEOPLE. DID YOU KNOW LOOK AT THE YOU KNOW -- ATTEND A PLAY. WHATEVER THE EVENTS IN THE PROGRAMS AND THEIR DODGING YOU KNOW THE THE BUCKETS THERE FROM ALL THE LEAKS IN THE ROOF. I MEAN YOU CAN'T FOCUS ON THE CONTENT THEN THE PRODUCION OF THESE UP PROGRAMS IT SHOWS WHEN. WHEN YOU GOT TO WORRY ABOUT THAT OR PAYING THE RENT I MEAN THAT THIS REALLY? IT'S REALLY RIDICULOUS AND IT'S SHAMEFUL WITHOUT A DOUBT THAT HAPPENS. ALWAYS IN LOW INCOME AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR SO ANYWAY IT'S A LONGER CONVERSATION BUT I'M VERY INTERESTED AND I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE MORE MONEY. LISTENING THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU BYE [inaudible] FALLS BROKE. I THINK WE'RE PROOF. RAZA YES. CENTER NIELSEN SENATOR UMBERG. THANK YOU SO MUCH [inaudible] YEAH YEAH. OKAY -- I'M SO SORRY. I AM SO SORRY. YES I AM I APOLOGIZE THAT'S OKAY I'M MY NAME'S JULIE BAKER AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIANS FOR THEARTS STATEWIDE ARTS ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION FIRST FULL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND SENATOR AMBERG. NOT GONNA TALK YOU OUT OF IT I'M HERE TO SUPPORT WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ACTUALLY I JUST WANNA SAY AS A CITIZEN WHO'S BEEN HERE SINCE THE BEGINNING. SO. IMPRESSED BY BOTH OF YOU IN TERMS OF YOUR ACTIVE LISTENING AND YOUR COMPASSION AND INTEREST IN ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WERE BROUGHT TODAY. BUT I AM HERE TO SPEAK DIRECTLY ABOUT THE ARTS AND I JUST WANTED TO BRING OUT SOME STATISTICS AND METRICS AND THINGS THAT WE CAN LOOK AT IN TERMS OF WHERE WE ARE. SO WE BELIEVE THAT CAL AND YOU'RE WELCOME TO STAND BECAUSE I KNOW WE'RE READY TO GO. WE BELIEVE THAT -- CALIFORNIA IS THE LEADING STATE OF CREATIVITY AND SHOULD BE THE STATE OF THE ART -- BUT WHERE WE ARE EVEN WITH THIS TEN MILLION DOLLARS WE'RE STILL UNDER ONE DOLLAR PER PERSON PER CAPITA. TERMS OF FUNDING THE ARTS SO COMPLETELY SUPPORT THE NEED FOR MORE THE MEDIAN IS A DOLLAR TEN ACROSS THE NATION SO WE'RE NOT WHERE WE SHOULD BE AT ALL. BUT WE DO KNOW ALSO INCREDIBLE NUMBERS COMING OUT OF THE PURE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS WHICH IS SHOWING THAT THE STATE'S CREATIVE ECONOMY FOR CALIFORNIA. IS SEVEN POINT 1% OF GROSS STATE PRODUCT. THIS IS THE HEAD OF AGRICULTURE AND TRANSPORTATION IS A REALLY IMPRESSIVE NUMBERS AND TALKING ABOUT HOW DO YOU SPEAK TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS ON WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO CREATE PIPE LINE. TERMS OF ARTS ED AND PROGRAM SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THIS CREATIVE ECONOMY CONTINUE TO FUEL CALIFORNIA THESE ARE THE NUMBERS THAT WE AS CALIFORNIANS FOR THE ARTS AND THE DATA AND TELLING THE STORIES WILL BE CONTINUING TO PUT OUT THERE SO. WE ABSOLUTELY SAY THIS FUNDING SHOULD NOT ONLY BE. INSTITUTED THIS YEAR BUT SHOULD OF COURSE INCREASE TO THE NUMBERS THAT WE SHOULD BE IN TERMS OF WHERE WE SHOULD BE ASKED CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU SO RICHLY THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME'S CHRIS VERTIGO I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE SAN FRANCISCO GAY MEN'S CHORUS. AND NOW THE BRAND NEW NATIONAL LGBTQ. ARTS CENTER.
