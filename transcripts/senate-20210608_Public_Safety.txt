ALLOWING DEPUTY SHERIFF TO PERFORM THE DUTIES OF A PEACE OFFICER AS PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS THESE EMPLOYEES ARE ALREADY IN UNIFORM AND OCCASIONALLY HAVE ASSIGNMENTS THAT TAKE THEM OUTSIDE THE JAIL SETTING BUT HAVE A MORE LIMITED ABILITY IN THEIR CAPACITY TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT THIS PARTICULAR SECTION OF THE LAW ALLOWS MANY IN FACT MOST OF THE COUNTIES- IN THE STATE ALREADY THESE- PRIVILEGES ARE TO BE ABLE TO DO. SO THIS WOULD BE JUST ADDING A FEW OF THE- RULE COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE THESE SAME LEVELS OF- OF RESPONSIBILITY. AB SEVEN SEVEN NINE WOULD REMEDY THE ISSUES BY ALLOWING CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS TO PERFORM THOSE CORRECTIONS RELATED TO TASKS- HERE TODAY WITH ME- IT BY VIRTUE OF VIRTUAL. ON THE TV SCREENS.

EIGHT THIRTY POINT ONE CTC AUTHORIZES PEACE OFFICER STATUS TWO CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS UNSPECIFIED COUNTIES WHILE ON DUTY AND ENGAGED IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THEIR DUTIES ALL AND PERFORMING OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT DUTIES.

IT WOULD ALLOW CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS TO BE ARMED ABOUT PERFORMING CORRECTIONS RELATED TASKS SUCH AS TRANSPORT. IT WOULD ALSO ALLOW THE SHERIFF COULD APPLY CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS DURING A LOCAL STATE OF EMERGENCY INCREASE IN AVAILABLE RESOURCES TO ASSIST AFRICAN TO MANAGEMENT. EIGHTY SEVEN SEVEN NINE HAS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND HAVE DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN CO AUTHOR. IS CHANGING FAST IT WILL ALLOW EACH COUNTY COULD BETTER SERVE THEIR RESIDENT.

AND NOBODY IS KILLING UP MISTER CHAIR ALL RIGHT. BERICHTEN I WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS AS RELATES TO AB SEVEN SEVEN NINE. CENTER SKINNER. YES I HAVE A QUESTION. SKINNER HAS A QUESTION FOR ASSUME BIGELOW YOU ACCEPT QUESTION. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IF WE CLASSIFY THESE INDIVIDUALS IN THE WAY THAT YOU'RE ASKING. THAT THEY WOULD BE THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO CARRY WEAPONS IN FACT TWENTY FOUR SEVEN. HOWEVER THEY WERE NEVER HAD THE SAME LEVEL OF POST TRAINING REGARDING WEAPONS IS THAT CORRECT THAT THAT IS NOT A CORRECT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THEY WILL HAVE THE SAME AS POST TRAINING AND CERTIFICATIONS ACCORDING TO SHERIFF BRAUN WHO JUST TESTIFIED A MOMENTS AGO SHE'S LIKE SHE SPELL THAT OUT. AND I HI TO I HAVE COTRADICTORY INFORMATION I DON'T WANT TO INDICATE THAT THE SHERIFF IS WRONG HOWEVER I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT STATUTE IN WOULD APPEAR THAT IT'S NOT THE SAME LEVEL OF TRAINING IS NOT REQUIRED. FOR CERTIFICATION. ON THAT CARD THAT GIVES ME SOME PAUSE. I THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. OKAY ARE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS AS IT RELATES TO AB SEVEN SEVEN NINE FROM MEMBERS ON THE COMMITTEE. CENTER WINNER. I THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN YEAH AND I JUST MENTION THIS AYE AYE AYE AYE THE SAME QUESTION A CENTER SKINNER HAD EARLIER THIS BILL HAS PASSED BEFORE IT'S BEEN VETOED BEFORE THAT'S ALL OTHER IF YOU SEEN GOVERNOR- AND THIS IS LIKE SEEMS LIKE A SUPER MESSY AREA OF THE LAW OR LIKE DIFFERENT COUNTIES ARE AUTHORIZED TO DO DIFFERENT THINGS- AS I UNDERSTAND THAT AND YOU KNOW- SERVICE SIMILAR UNDERSTANDING TO WHAT'S AND SKINNER EXPRESSED. THAT VIS. THIS CATEGORY THE PENAL CODE. OF OFFICERS. DON'T SOME OF THEM HAVE FULL PRO CERTIFICATES BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TO HAVE. FULL CLOSER TO VEGAS THEY HAVE TO HAVE SOME LEVEL OF FIREARM TRAINING BUT IT MAY NOT. HAVE TO BE THE FULL. ALONE POST- AND SO AS A RESULT THERE ONLY AUTHORIZED TO DISCHARGE THE DUTIES AND CARRY A FIREARM IN THE CUSTODIAL SETTING. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE COUNTIES WANT TO HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY HAVEN'T TRANSPORT. PEOPLE AND MUST BE ABLE TO BE FULL OFFICERS DURING A TRANSPORT BUT THE WAY THAT THE BILL INSIDE CHRIS IN THE BILL IT'S JUST THIS AREA OF THE LAW THE WAY IT'S- STRUCTURED IT WOULD GIVE THEM. THE ABILITY I COUNTY COULD SEND THEM OFF ON THE PATROL. BUT BUT I DON'T MAY HAVE DONE THAT BUT THEY COULD AND THEN THEY'LL BE OUT OF CONTROL CARRYING A GUN. DOING EVERYTHING THAT A POLICE OFFICER DOES NOT NECESSARILY HAVING THE FULL. LEVEL OF TRAINING THAT OFFICER. WOULD HAVE NOTS WILL RESIST THE- CONCERN SO A ROOKIE WANT TO RESPOND. TO THAT.THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THAT ARE APPRECIATED IN YOUR YOUR HISTORY IS CORRECT THIS BILL HAS BEEN UP BEFORE FACTS BEEN UP TWICE IN EACH. EACH TIME IT'S COME UP BEFORE IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN ON THE CONSENT CALENDARS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BUILDING AND GOTTEN OUT AND GONE TO THE GOVERNOR ONE TIME IT WAS. THERE WAS TOO MANY COUNTIES- WE HAD ACTUALLY INCLUDED UP A LARGER NUMBER OF COUNTIES THAT WANTED TO HAVE THIS FLEXIBILITY AN- OPTION AVAILABLE THAT SO MANY OTHER COUNTIES ALREADY HAVE AND SO- AT THE TIME IT WAS VETOED AS YOU SAID- THIS LAST YEAR. BY THE GOVERNOR AND THE GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE WAS CLEAR HE- HE SAID PLEASE BRING IT BACK IT'S JUST WASN'T THE TIMING WASN'T RIGHT FOR HIM AT THE MOMENT AND SO HENCE HERE WE ARE THIS YEAR ONCE AGAIN WITH A BILL THAT'S- AGAIN. TYPICALLY BEEN ON CONSENT CALENDAR AND ALL THE WAY THROUGH NOW WITH RESPECT TO YOUR QUESTIONS. AND CONCERNS. OVER THE POST TRAINING I AGREE WITH YOU WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE BEST TRAINED IN THE- THE PEOPLE TO HAVE ALL THE TRAINING. THAT'S NECESSARY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE DOING THEIR JOB IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND- PRUDENT WAY AND RESPONSIBLE WAY. AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO JUST LIKE OUR- DEPUTY SHERIFFS THEY GO ON RESERVES AND SUCH THEY ALL HAVE TO HAVE THE POST CERTIFICATIONS. THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE TRAININGS. REQUIRED BY THE LOCAL SHERIFF'S IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO. SERVING IN THESE CAPACITIES AS A SWORN OFFICER SO. TO MIKE'S DEATH KNOWLEDGE OF EXTENT I BELIEVE THAT- THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE. AND WILL HAVE THE TRAINING. SOTHAT THAT WAS MY KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING IN MOVING THIS FORWARD. I DON'T KNOW SHERIFF BRAUN IS HONOR IF SHE'S GOT ANY- ADDED COMMENTS THAT SHE WANTS TO ADD ON BUT IF SHE'S NOT STILL ON THE LINE THAT'S FINE. I'LL LET MY WORDS STAND AS THEY ARE. SO MY READERS ARE STILL AVAILABLE FOR. YES THIS IS CHEVRON AND I AM I STILL ON THE LINE. WE CAN HEAR YOU. GREAT SO YES I DID THAT EVEN THAT IT'S ONLY FOR CERTAIN COUNTIES AS OF OCT IN PROCESS THIS DOESN'T WORK FOR EVERY COUNTY SO IT'S UP TO THE COUNTY DECIDED. LEVEL- AT A CORRECTIONAL OFFICER MAKING THE CORRECTIONAL DEPUTIES DOES THIS WORK FOR OUR COUNTY TOOK AN OPT FIT FOR EVERY COUNTY SO THE COUNTY HAVE TO ASK TO BE PART OF. YOU KNOW CODE WHICH IS WHY. WE ARE GOING TO THIS PROCESS FOR THE THIRD TIME AND THAT WAS MISUNDERSTOOD IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THE FIRST GO AROUND WHEN I GOT TO KEEP IT WAS NOT COMMUNICATED. WITH YOU REALIZE THAT IT NEEDED TO BE COMMUNICATED THAT WITH AN ONGOING PROCESS AND- TO THE POINT- WILL THEY BE PROPERLY TRAINED ALL OF MY DEPUTIES. AND MY CORRECTION OFFICERS THEY TRAIN TOGETHER THEY'LL GO THROUGH THE SAME TRAINING. EVERY CORRECTIONAL. OFFICER THAT I HAVE AND THAT THE OTHER COUNTIES HAVE GO THROUGH. THE TRAINING THAT'S REQUIRED EIGHT THIRTY TWO PC. AND THEY WILL I WOULDN'T. PUT THEM OUT ON THE STREET- AS DEPUTIES DURING TRAFFIC STOP. THAT NATURE BECAUSE IF GIVES THEM- AN ADDED LAYER OF PROTECTION WHILE THEY ARE. WORKING IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION OKAY I HAVE A FIRE LIKE WE HAD. A FIRE AND I HAVE VERY LIMITED RESOURCES I HAVE INCLUDING ME. TWENTY FOUR FOUR DEPUTIES. FOUR THIRTY TWO HUNDRED SQUARE MILES I AM VERY LIMITED RESOURCES TO THIS IS OF COURSE MULTIPLIER FOR ME TO HAVE THAT ADDED RESOURCE WHERE I CAN. GET MY CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS. ANOTHER BASIS YOU HAVE TO GO OUT AND HELP IN AN EMERGENCY OR HAVE THEM ARMS FOR TRANSPORT FOR THE DAY OUR STATE SO THAT THE COMMUNITY IS. AND A DANGEROUS AND MAKE. THIS IS A REASONABLE NEED TO ADDRESS- CONCEALED KERRY PARK OF IT BACK IS. TRUE THAT IS THAT THEY WOULD. HAVE FULL PEACE OFFICER STATUS. AND BE ALLOWED TO CARRY CONCEALED AT EVERY PEACE OFFICER IS ALLOWED TO CARRY CONCEALED. AS I STATED IN MY EARLIER TESTIMONY ALL OF MY- CORRECTIONAL STAFF WHO WISH TO HAVE THAT A CONCEALED CARRY PERMIT ALREADY DEAL IN TRADE PARTNER BACKGROUND CHECKS. AND EVERYTHING THAT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE SURE THAT I AM NOT PUTTING A GUN INTO THE HANDS OF A PERSON WHO SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. THIRTY NINE CENTER I MEAN SOMEONE BIGELOW CHART CLOSE I WOULD JUST HOPE THAT THE WORDS OF THE SHARP- HELPED ANSWER THE QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE AND HOPEFULLY YOU CAN EACH FIND IN EUROPE.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU MEMBERS APPRECIATED. ALL RIGHT NOW MOVING ON TO YOUR NEXT ITEM AB TWELVE TEN. US I SEE ITS IMPLEMENTING IS HERE AS HE PREPARED FOR HIS TESTIMONY AS SOON AS WE CLEAN UP THE PODIUM WILL. ALLOW US TO MOVE MEMBER TEAM TO MAKE HIS PRESENTATION ON A V. TWELVE. THANK IN MATURE COMMITTEE MEMBERS LET ME JUST FIRST THANK YOU WHEN YOUR STAFF- FOR PRESENTING THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THEM WHICH IS A TO SPECIFIC PERCENTAGE OF COMMISSIONERS. WITH HER PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE RATHER THAN A NUMBER SO THAT IS A BOARD AS A BOARD SIZE ME CHANGED A PORTION OF REPRESENTATION WITHIN THE BOARD IS MAINTAINED. AS YOU ALL KNOW THE COMMISSIONERS WHO SERVE ON THE CALIFORNIA BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS MAKE VERY. CRITICAL DECISIONS HI EVEN THOUGH THAT PROFESSIONAL. THE DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE EXISTING LAW DOES MANDATE THAT THESE COMMISSIONERS SHOULD REFLECT THE CROSS SECTION OF RACIAL SEXUAL ECONOMIC AND GEOGRAPHIC FEATURES OF THE POPULATION. THE CALIFORNIA. CURRENTLY THE SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OVERWHELMINGLY COMES FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT BACKGROUNDS IN DOESN'T REPRESENT THAT DIVERSITY. AB TWELVE TEN REQUIRE THAT AT LEAST 60% OF COMMISSIONERS ON THE BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS HAVE SPECIFIED PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUNDS BUT DROUGHT BY JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. FIVE TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL PROFESSOR HAD DARK- I'VE I'VE RUN FROM THE UC HASTINGS AS WELL AS A TEAM IN A JOHNSON FROM UNCOMMON LAW. ARE YOUR SEARCH KEY WITNESSES PREPARED RIGHT NOW IF THAT'S- I WOULD HOPE SO LET'S SEE IF THE MODERATOR CAN YOU QUEUE UP TO TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. OF AB. TWELVE TEN. BOB DOLE'S LIFE SHOULD BE. OPEN BIGGEST NEED ON MUTE THEIR LINE FOR ME PROFESSOR YOU PREPARED. I'M HERE THANK YOU. THERE WE GO OKAY WE'LL START WITH OUR PROFESSOR OPERON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWELVE TEN MY NAME IS DOROTHY RAHMAN A LAW PROFESSOR AT UC HASTINGS I HAVE A BOOK THAT RECENTLY CAME OUT YESTERDAY MONSTERS WHICH IS THE PRODUCT OF YEARS OF RESEARCH AND IT'S AN IN DEPTH EXAMINATION OF THE CALIFORNIA PAROLE HEARING SYSTEM. I ALSO COORDINATE THE NATIONAL RESEARCH NETWORK ON PULL ONE OF MY MAIN OBSERVATIONS OF THE BOOK WAS THAT WHILE THE BOARD IS DIVERSE IN TERMS OF RACE AND GENDER IT IS NOT DIVERSE IN TERMS OF PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND THE VAST MAJORITY OF COMMISSIONERS COME FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT BACKGROUNDS FORMER SHERIFFS POLICE CHIEFS AND CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS. THIS FAR REACHING IMPLICATIONS OF TO THE NATURE AND RESULT OF THE HEARINGS THE CURRENT COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD THE FACT THAT SEVERAL TRANSFORMATION TO CALIFORNIA PUNISHMENT BUT HAPPEN THROUGHOUT THE LATE NINETEEN SEVENTY TO NINETY EIGHT OVER THE YEARS THE TIME BEFORE THE INITIAL HEARING AT BETWEEN HEARINGS INCREASED ACTUARIAL RISK ASSESSMENT REPLACED CORRECTIONAL COUNSELORS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS. THE ROLE OF PROSECUTORS AND VICTIM SUPPORTERS EXPONENTIALLY INCREASED AND VOTERS APPROVED A GUBERNATORIAL VETO ON PAROLE BOARD DECISION TO RELEASE CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF ONLY FOUR STATES THAT HAVE THIS ADDITIONAL POLITICAL KEEP GATEKEEPING FUNCTION ON IT COLD SYSTEM DESPITE REPEATED INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURTS TO FOCUS ON THE PRO APPLICANTS FUTURE PROSPECTS AND RISKS THE BOARD ACT DEFENSIVELY FINDING WAYS TO BYPASS THIS REQUIREMENT AND DENIED PAROLE ON THE BASIS OF CRIME THAT HAPPENED DECADES AGO. EVEN TO PEOPLE WHO ACCORDING TO ROBUST CRIMINOLOGICAL RESEARCH UP LONG GO EACH DAY OUT OF CRIME THE CONSEQUENCES RECOMMENDATIONS WERE RELEASED A RARE ACCOUNTING FOR ONLY 16217% OF ALL HEARINGS. IT IS UNSURPRISING THAT A GROUP COMPRISED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IS PROFESSIONALLY AND CULTURALLY PREDISPOSED TO ACCEPT COURT RECORDS AND DISCIPLINARY WRITE UPS OF INCONTROVERTIBLE TRUTHS MAKE BIASED ASSUMPTIONS. ABOUT PEOPLE FROM THEIR DEMEANOR AND BODY A LANGUAGE. AND THEY TEND TO LOOK AND THERE OF EXPENSE OF MORE CALL STORIES PEOPLE ENVIRONMENT AND CIRCLE. THE COMMISSIONERS ALSO EXHIBIT REGARDING THE WOEFULLY INADEQUATE USE OF OUR PRISON PROGRAMMING SYSTEM LAYING THE BLAME FOR INACCESSIBLE OR NONEXISTENT REHABILITATION PROGRAMS ON THE FOR ALL APPLICANTS THEMSELVES DESPITE SOME CONTINUING EDUCATION WORKSHOPS THE COMMISSIONERS OF THE GROUP DO NOT POSSESS DEEP PROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE ON ISSUES SUCH AS SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH. THE COMMISSIONER REGULARLY PRIDE THEMSELVES FOR BEING ABLE TO DETECT FALSE REMORSE OR LACK OF INSIGHT UNFORTUNATELY THIS SELF ASSESSMENT CLAIM IS CONTRADICTED BY THE PAST UMBILICAL RESEARCH EXPERIMENTS LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS REGULARLY EXPRESSED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE CERTAINTY ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO DETECT LIFE. AND REGULARLY DO SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION IN TELLING TRUTH AND LIES THE PARKS. WE ARE IN A UNIQUE MOMENT IN HISTORY IN WHICH WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MULTIPLE FORMS OF WISDOM AND EXPERTISE NOT ONLY THE EXPERTISE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ARE ESSENTIAL TO SOLVE SOCIAL PROBLEMS AND OFFER HOPE TO FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. I ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT AB ONE TWO ONE ZERO SO THAT PAROLE BOARDS ARE ANOTHER SITE OPEN TRANSFORMATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO OUR NEXT WITNESS- DAMIEN JOHNSON. MODERATORS MISTER JOHNSONVILLE. YES I AM PLEASE GO AHEAD BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE MEANT. MY NAME IS DAMIEN JOHNSON I'M A LEGAL ASSISTANT ADAM COMMON LAW I'M- CITIZENS WITH WEEKLY BEEN DISCHARGED FROM PAROLE I STRONGLY SUPPORT A B. TWELVE CHAIR. WHY DO BIRDS CLUB BOARD. AS SOMEONE WHO ATTENDED ELEVEN CORALS ABILITY HEARINGS DURING MY THIRTY FIVE YEARS MCCARTY RATIONS. I COULD SHARE MY EXPERIENCES. BEFORE PRO BOWL THAT IS ALL EXCLUSIVELY MADE UP OF LOS. OR COMMIT LOG BACK. MORE THAN ONE OCCASION COMMISSIONER SEEM TO HAVE A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING THE ENVIRONMENT I GREW UP. AND ITS AFFECT ON THE DECISION BY MAY A COMMON REPLY WAS I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS COULD HAPPEN OR HOW IT COULD AFFECT YOU IN THIS WAY HE OR THAT MAKES NO SENSE. EVERYONE KNEW THAT I WAS READY TO COME HOME INCLUDING CORRECTIONAL STAFF. HOWEVER THE COMMISSIONERS TO BE TO SPEAK A CERTAIN WAY BECAUSE THEY WOULD. THE RELEASE ME I FOUND THE COMMISSIONER FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT BACKGROUND PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN A PART OF THE CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM FILLED UNDERSTAND. WE'LL KEEP ACCESSING POSITIVE PRISON PROGRAM. I WAS REPEATEDLY CENTER COULD NOT BE DISPLAYED IN PROGRAMS THAT DID NOT EXIST IN THE PRESENT I WAS COMPILING TWO FORMER NOT AVAILABLE TO ME BECAUSE- COOKED TO THE LEVEL. APPOINTING A MORE DIVERSE BOARD WOULD HAVE FAR REACHING IMPLICATIONS THAT GO WAY BEYOND MY CASE. FOR CAR THREE WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN ABUSED BY THEIR PARTNERS AND HAVE EXPERIENCED COMIC OR ELDERLY PAROLE APPLICANTS. WITH DEALING WITH MEDICAL ISSUES THAT THAT CURRENT MEASURES ALL UNDERSTAND THAT WITH SO MANY OTHERS BEHIND BARS FOR THE BOARDS BOARD. WOULD BE BETTER ABLE TO SEE THE WHOLE PERSON NOT JUST THEIR ACTIONS. IT WOULD HELP IT WOULD ALSO HELP THE BOARD HAD MORE REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS ABOUT INCREASING PROGRAM WHICH IS CRUCIAL TO DETERMINING PAROLE SUITABILITY. INCLUDING THAT THANK. YOU ALL. THE TIME AND I URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON AB TWELVE TEN BECAUSE DIVERSIFIED THE BOARD INCLUDING HAVING A FORMERLY INCARCERATED COMMISSIONER. WOULD MAKE IT MORE RECEPTIVE TO UNDERSTAND DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS CULTURES. LIKE EXPERIENCES THAT EXPRESSED. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

SOME CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF OUR PAROLE BOARD ARE WE- WHILE THE CRITERIA FOR. THE CREATURES THAT YOU'RE ADDING CARTERI FOR THEIR YOU KNOW THAT THE MEAT COUGH. IS GOOD. IS THERE ROOM NOW. FOR OBVIOUSLY THESE DIFFERENT PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUNDS ARE GOOD- BUT I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT- WHEN WE THINK ABOUT PEOPLE THAT ARE INCARCERATED. IT IS RARE FOR THEM TO HAVE SUCH PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUNDS AND WHILE THERE IS PROVISION IN YOUR BILL FOR ONE PERSON TO HAVE BEEN- FORMALLY INCARCERATED. I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT THE BUDGET THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN FACT I'M I'M SORT OF NOT THAT THE PAROLE COMMISSION NEEDS TO BE COMPARABLE TO A JURY BUT I'M THINKING ABOUT IT HOW. ARE PRINCIPLES OF A JURY ARE THAT YOU ARE. YOU ARE JUDGED BY YOUR PEERS. AND THAT. IT THERE SEEMS TO ME TO BE OF VALUE. TO PEOPLE WHO CAN JUST RELATE TO A PERSON'S CIRCUMSTANCE. AND SO WHAT I'M WONDERING. AND MAYBE I DON'T UNDERSTAND ENOUGH ABOUT THE CURRENT CRITERIA FOR BREAK IS THIS ONLY COVERS THIS WILL COVER YOUR NEW CRITERIA WILL COVER SIXTY PERCENT. IS A CURRENT CRITERIA SUCH THAT EIGHT. A PERSON WITH GENERIC KNOWLEDGE WOULD BE ABLE TO BE APPOINTED. UP UP WITH PROBABLY NOPE. STANDARDS BACK REQUIRED OF FULL. WHAT IS IN.

OKAY IN THIS ROOM THINKING I GOING TO THANK YOU FOR THOSE- SOCIETY I THINK THE BETTER THAT PAROLE BOARD IS IN DIVERSITY AND MAKING THOSE DECISIONS ARE BETTER OFF WALL B. AND M. BETTER SERVE THOSE MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE SERVED THEIR TIME SO ON THAT NOTE- WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR WIENER WE HAVE A TO PASS- SO CONSULTANT PLEASE COUNSEL PLEASE CALL THE ROLL AB ONE AB TWELVE GEN AB TWELVE TEN THE PAST BRADFORD. AYE IT SHOWED BOTH COM LONGER COME LATER AYE SKINNER BY. IN OUR AYE WIENER. WHEN OUR EYES FOR THE THAT MEASURE HAS FOR VOTE TO OUT GRADUALLY IT'S ROUTE. NOW WE'RE MOVING ON TO ALLOW US ITEM BY SENATOR CALL MARGARET AB TWELVE. ONE TWO SEVEN. WHEREVER YOU'RE COMFORTABLE. WHILE WAITING I WILL OPEN THE ROLE ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR ALLOW ARE ABSENT MEMBERS TO ADD ON TO THE CONSENT CALENDAR COUNSEL YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL LONG CONCERNED KELLER CONSENT CALENDAR WINNER. AYE WIENER AYE FOR VOTES THE MEASURES OUT FOUR ZERO. SENATOR WHEN YOU'RE READY YOU MAY BEGIN. A CHAIR AND GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PRESENTING. AB ONE TWENTY SEVEN. WHICH AMENDS THE CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE TO PERMIT AN EMPLOYEE OF A PUBLIC PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE TO PRESENT A PROBABLE CAUSE DETERMINATION TO A JUDGE. IN SEEKING AN ARREST WARRANT IN CASES WHERE THE SUBJECT IS A PEACE OFFICER. THE AIM IS TO REDUCE PROCEDURAL BARRIERS TWO POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY. BY ELIMINATING ONE OF THEMFOR DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND INITIATING PROSECUTIONS AGAINST MEMBERS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT SO. CURRENTLY AN ARREST WARRANT REQUIRES A JUDGE TO FIND PROBABLE CAUSE FOR ARREST. AND OUR PENAL CODE RIGHT NOW REQUIRES THAT A PEACE OFFICER MUST ESTABLISH PROBABLE CAUSE TO SUPPORT THE ARREST WARRANT OF ONE OF THEIR OWN. WHICH MEANS THAT CURRENTLY WHEN PROSECUTORS ARE SEEKING AN ARREST WARRANT FOR A MEMBER OF LAW ENFORCEMENT THEY NEED THE COOPERATION OF ANOTHER PEACE OFFICER. IN ORDER TO SUPPLY THAT JUDGE WITH THE NECESSARY INFORMATION NEEDED TO ESTABLISH PROBABLE CAUSE AND AS WE KNOW. NO ONE LIKES A SNITCH WHICH MAKES THIS REALLY HARD TO DO. SO AB ONE TWENTY SEVEN WOULD CLARIFY THAT A DECLARATION OF PROBABLE CAUSE FOR AN ARREST WARRANT NEED NOT BE PROVIDED ONLY BY A PEACE OFFICER BUT% COULD ALSO BE PROVIDED BY A PROSECUTOR. THE PROPOSED CHANGE IN LAW WOULD MAKE NO OTHER CHANGES TO THE PROCESS OF OBTAINING AN ARREST WARRANT BEYOND THE EXPANSION OF POSSIBLE AFGHANS BEYOND PEACE OFFICERS AND IT WOULD NOT CHANGE THE PROBABLE CAUSE STANDARD OF PROOF. AND JUDGES WOULD STILL RETAIN THE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE AN ARREST WARRANT. WITH ME IN SUPPORT IS CHESS OF UDINE THE SAN FRANCISCO DISTRICT ATTORNEY. WE WILL ALLOW YOU TO SET A COUPLE OF- FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK TODAY THANK YOU CHAIR BRADFORD YEAH COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. I AM THE SAN FRANCISCO DISTRICT ATTORNEY CHANGEABLE- AND I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK. HELPING CALIFORNIA TO MOVE TOWARDS SAFER STRONGER COMMUNITIES BUT ALSO FOR THEATTENTION TO CRITICAL ISSUES INVOLVING POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY. ON THAT WANT TO THANK THANK CENTER COME LONGER. FOR HER WORK ON THIS ISSUE- IT MOVING TOWARDS AN IMPORTANT CHANGE. IN THE LAW. IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR NATION GREENBANK OR DANTE RIGHT FOR GEORGE FLOYD FOR BRIANNA TAYLOR AND SHARKS ARE TOO MANY OTHERS KILLED AT THE HANDS OF POLICE. PUBLIC OUTRAGE HAS LED TO A DEMAND FOR GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY. IN THE IN RESPONSE TO POLICE VIOLENCE. EVEN WITH THIS INCREASE CALL ACCOUNT IT REMAINS RARE FOR DISTRICT ATTORNEYS TO INITIATE PROSECUTIONS AGAINST POLICE OFFICERS WHO VIOLATE. THE LAW WHILE ON DUTY LET'S NOT FORGET THAT IT TOOK A NATIONAL PROTEST MOVEMENTS BEFORE CHARGES WERE FINALLY FILED AGAINST THE OFFICERS WHO KILL GEORGE FLOYD. THE ONE OBSTACLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THE PROSECUTION OF POLICE OFFICERS IS THE UNWILLINGNESS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ASSIST IN THE PROSECUTION OF ONE OF THEIR OWN. IT CAN LEAD TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS REFUSING TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY INFORMATION TO SUPPORT OR INVESTIGATE AND ARREST WARRANT. AB ONE TWO SEVEN IS A PRACTICAL AND NECESSARY SIMPLE CHANGE IN THE LAW THAT WOULD ADDRESS ONE OF THESE BARRIERS TO POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY SH THE PROPOSED CHANGE IN LAW DOES NOT IN ANY WAY MODIFY THE ROLE OF THE MAGISTRATE OR JUDGE IN MAKING THE FINAL DETERMINATION ABOUT WHETHER. ENOUGH EVIDENCE EXISTS TO INITIATE THE CASE. WE EXPANDS COOL CAT CASTLES TO THE INFORMATION IN THE INVESTIGATION BEFORE A JUDGE. WELL BECAUSE EXISTS FOR REST WHEN THE SUBJECT OF THAT ARREST IS A PEACE OFFICER THIS IS A NARROW AND SIMPLE AND TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS TO ELIMINATE A BARRIER TO POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY IT WOULD ALLOW FOR MORE THAN ONLY A PEACE OFFICER TO ATTACHED TO THE EVIDENCE IN AN INVESTIGATION- THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN THOSE CASES. WHERE A PEACE OFFICER IS THE SUBJECT OF THE INVESTIGATION OF A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. UNDER THIS LAW AS STATED BY SENATOR COM LOG AND IMPLODE THE OF A PUBLIC PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE EVEN IF NOT A SWORN PEACE OFFICER WOULD ALSO BE ALLOWED TO MAKE A DECLARATION IN SUPPORT OF PROBABLE CAUSE. TO A JUDGE OR MAGISTRATE. IS PRESIDENT FROM OTHER STATES AROUND THE COUNTRY FOR THIS PROPOSED CHANGE IN LAW THERE ARE IN FACT NINE STATES. THAT ALLOW PERSONS OTHER THAN A PEACE OFFICER TO ATTEST THAT PROBABLE CAUSE EXISTS COURT ARREST WARRANT SHE WAS NINE STATES INCLUDING. NEW JERSEY NORTH CAROLINA SOUTH CAROLINA PENNSYLVANIA MARYLAND OHIO TEXAS VIRGINIA AND GEORGIA SH. AND THIS CHANGE WILL ALSO CRACK THE LAW AS IT EXISTS IN CALIFORNIA WITH REGARD TO SEARCH WARRANT AFFIDAVIT SHE IN SHORT. CHANGES PRACTICAL IT'S NECESSARY AND IT'S COMMON PRACTICE IN MANY OTHER STATES. FOR THESE REASONS I AM PROUD TO SPONSOR.
