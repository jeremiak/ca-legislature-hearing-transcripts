WHICH MISS BELLOW WILL BE REFERENCING AS WE GO THROUGH THIS PRESENTATION. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US MISS BELLA AND PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR JENNY BELLOW AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION PROPOSAL FOR THE MAJOR. HUMAN SERVICES AB PROGRAMS AND DEPARTMENTS FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET YEAR. AS YOU HAVE NOTED I WILL BE SPEAKING FROM A HANDOUT TODAY THAT IS POSTED TO OUR WEBSITE AND TO THE ASSEMBLY IS WEBSITE. OUR OFFICE IS STILL IN THE EARLY STAGES OF UNDERSTANDING THE PROPOSALS THAT ARE CONTAINED IN THE MAYOR VISION. AND OVER THE NEXT COMING DAYS AND WEEKS WE WILL BE PROVIDING YOU WITH ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS AND THOUGHT HE TAKE AWAYS AND QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE. TO ASSIST YOU- IN IN YOUR BUDGET DECISIONS COMING FORWARD. PAGE ONE OF THE HAND OUT. AS YOU'VE ALREADY NOTED THERE THE BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT YOU RECEIVED LAST WEEK IT'S VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE THAT YOU RECEIVED IN JANUARY. THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY THAT IS BROUGHT ON BY THE CORONA VIRUS PANDEMIC HAS RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES FOR THE STATE AND RESULTED IN NEGATIVE CONDITIONS FOR THE BUDGET. SO THE TABLE ON PAGE ONE REALLY LAYS OUT THE EVOLUTION OF THE BUDGET AD HOW IT'S CHANGED SINCE YOU LAST SIDE IN JANUARY. WE THOUGHT THIS IMPORTANT AND IN AT AN IMPORTANT DISPLAY IS TO HELP YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE DIFFERENT PIECES ARE MOVING. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE TABLE THERE'S A LOT OF NUMBERS HERE SO I'LL WALK YOU THROUGH SOME OF THE KEY TAKE AWAYS. IF YOU LOOK AT THE- THREE COLUMNS THE FIRST THREE COLUMNS. THIS IS REALLY SHOWING YOU. A PICTURE OF THE CURRENT YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. AND IT'S SHOWING YOU WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION THOUGHT THE MAJOR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS WHAT COST. AT THE TIME OF THE JANUARY BUDGET. AND COMPARING IT TO MAY. AND SHOWING YOU THE DIFFERENCE. I THINK THE TAKE AWAY HERE IS THAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE CHANGE IN THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM. THE CHANGES HERE ARE RELATIVELY MODEST THEY REALLY ENCOMPASS CHANGES IN CASE LOADING COST. ALSO THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN BY THAT HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. AND THE MONTH OF MARCH AND APRIL. TO PROVIDE RELIEF. TO COUNTIES AND TWO RECIPIENTS OF PROGRAMS AS THEY DEALT. WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISES. THE OTHER THING THAT'S REFLECTED IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY NUMBERS. ARE THE FACT THAT THE STATE HAS SECURED ENHANCED FEDERAL FUNDING THROUGH THAT FEDERAL MEDICAID ASSISTANCE PERCENTAGE OR MAP INCREASE OF SIX PERCENT. AND THAT HAVE THE EFFECT OF OFFSETTING STATE GENERAL COSTS FOR CERTAIN PROGRAMS. BUT AGAIN THE REAL STORY HERE IS THAT THE CHANGES IN NINETEEN TWENTY A RELATIVELY MODEST WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CAL WORKS. AND THAT IS REALLY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASEIN THE CASE LOAD WHICH WILL DISCUSS LATER. MOVING OVER TO THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE COMPARISON AGAIN THIS IS SHOWING YOU. WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATED THE PROGRAMS TO COST IN TWENTY EIGHT IN JANUARY AND COMPARING THAT TO MAY. AND HERE IS WHERE YOU EE SOME REAL VARIANCE AND SAM. IS A MARKED DIFFERENCES AND CHANGES AND THIS IS BECAUSE- IT IS A FULL YEAR OF CASELOAD IMPACTS. THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A CORONA VIRUS. SO AGAIN MAJOR INCREASES AND PROGRAMS LIKE HOW IT WORKS ARE ESTIMATED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. ADDITIONALLY IT SHOWING A FULL YEAR OF FEDERAL FUNDING RELIEF. I'M THAT OFFSETS GENERAL FUND COSTS. AND THEN FINALLY IT'S IT REFLECTS THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION PROPOSALS WHICH HAVE. VARIOUS REDUCTIONS ACROSS THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS WHICH WE WILL AGAIN DISCUSS LATER. THE FINAL COLUMN REALLY SHOWS THE YEAR OVER DIFFERENCES BASED ON OUR BEST ESTIMATES AND AGAIN. THE MAJOR CHANGES THAT WHICH WE WILL DISCUSS. TURNING TO THE NEXT PAGE OF THE HANDOUT WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT NOT JUST THE GENERAL FUND CHANGES TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE PROGRAMS BUT TO LOOK AT TOTAL COSTS. THAT'S ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE WHOLE WORKS PROGRAM ALTHOUGH THE GENERAL FUND COSTA SHOWING A VERY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE YEAR OVER BASIS- OF OVER TWO TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT PERCENT. THE WHEN YOU LOOK AT TOTAL FUNDS THE INCREASE IS STILL VERY SIGNIFICANT AN UNPRECEDENTED BUT IT'S CLOSER TO FIFTY FIVE PERCENT. AND THIS IS REALLY DRIVEN BY AN ESTIMATED INCREASE IN THE HOWARD CASE LOAD ON A YEAR OVER BASIS A SEVENTY FIVE POINT 6% ANOTHER PROGRAM WHERE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL FUNDS NOT JUST THE GENERAL FUND IS AN IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM. FOR THAT PROGRAM YOU WILL HAVE NOTICED ON THE PRIOR PAGE THAT. THE GENERAL FUND WAS EXPECTED TO DECREASE. IN A YEAR OVER BASIS. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT TOTAL FUNDS. IT'S ACTUALLY EXPECTED TO INCREASE BY OVER 8% AND AGAIN THIS IS THE EFFECT OF THE FEDERAL ASSISTANCE RELATED TO THE AFTERMATH WHICH WE USED TO OFFSET THE GENERAL FUND COST OF THE PROGRAM. SHE TURNING NOW TO THE NEXT PAGE OF THE HANDOUT WE FIRST WHEN WE FIRST RECEIVED THE MAYOR VISION WE THOUGHT IT IMPORTANT TO LOOK BACK AT THE JANUARY PROPOSAL AS YOU'LL RECALL IN JANUARY THE BUDGET PICTURE WAS VERY DIFFERENT SO THE ADMINISTRATION HAD SEVERAL MAJOR AUGMENTATION PROPOSALS BEFORE YOU AND WE REALLY WANTED TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE TREATMENT OF THOSE IN THE NAY REVISION. GENERALLY THE TREATMENT FALLS INTO THREE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES SOME OF THE PROPOSALS IN FACT MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN WITHDRAWN SOME OF THOSE AUGMENTATION PROPOSALS SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY MODIFIED FOR EXAMPLE- IN JANUARY THE GOVERNOR WAS PROPOSING TO CREATE A NEW DEPARTMENT OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AT THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. AND NOW THAT PROPOSAL IS TO MOVED CHILD CARE PROGRAMS INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AS PART OF THE VISION SO SIGNIFICANT MODIFICATION TO THAT PROPOSAL THERE ARE A FEW JANUARY PROPOSALS THAT ROUTINE AND WE ARE CONTINUING TO DO A COMPLETE INVENTORY OF THOSE THAT YOU HAVE BEST INFORMATION YOU GO FORWARD AND JUST. THANK YOU. PAGE OF THE HANDOUT. YOU'LL SEE THE I'M OF MAJOR PROPOSALS THE MAJOR MAYOR BUDGET REDUCTION PROPOSALS PUT FORWARD BY THE ADMIN. I THINK ONE BIG TAKEAWAY HERE IS TAT AT UNLIKEOTHER AREAS OF THE BUDGET THE ADMINISTRATION TOOK A MORE TARGETED APPROACH AND HUMAN SERVICES- SOLUTIONS IT WAS NOT SORT OF BLANKET OVERALL PERCENTAGE DECREASE AS BUT MORE US SPECIFIC SPECIFIC ADD DECREASES FOR A SPECIFIC PROGRAM. ANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE HERE IS THAT THERE ARE REALLY TWO TYPES OF REDUCTIONS IN FRONT OF YOU. THERE ARE THE ONES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PUTTING FORWARD AS PART OF THEIR BASELINE BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT THEY WILL DO YOU NO MATTER WHAT. AND THEN THERE ARE A CATEGORY OF REDUCTION OF THEIR WE ARE REFERRING TO AS TRIGGER REDUCTIONS AND THESE ARE REDUCTIONS THAT ONLY GO INTO PLACE IF FEDERAL FUNDING OF FOURTEEN BILLION IS NOT. IS NOT SECURED BY THE STATE. SOLVE ALL WALK THROUGH THESE LESS AT A HIGH LEVEL AND THE FIRST ONE IS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING. THE PROPOSAL IS TO ELIMINATE THE MULTI PURPOSE SENIOR SERVICES PROGRAM. THIS IS A PROGRAM FOR LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE QUALIFY FOR SKILLED NURSING FACILITY AND IT PROVIDES CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO THEM IN THEIR HOME. THE NEXT PROPOSAL IS TO REDUCE THE SENIOR SERVICES NUTRITION AS THE SENIOR NUTRITION PROGRAM AT THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING. AND THIS IS THE PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES HOME DELIVERED MEALS AND CONGREGATE MEALS TO SENIORS. THERE'S A PROPOSAL TO REDUCE AGING AND DISABILITY RESOURCE CENTER FUNDING BY THREE MILLION THESE ARE YOUR NORWALK WRONG DOOR SPOTS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE SEEKING INFORMATION ON LONG TERM CARE. THERE'S THAT REQUEST THERE'S A PROPOSAL TO REDUCE THE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM BY TWO MILLION. MOVING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES AS PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S JANUARY PROPOSAL THERE WAS ACTUALLY A PROPOSAL TO INCREASE FUNDING FOR LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES. I ABOUT EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS AT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS WITHDRAWN THAT PROPOSAL AND ALSO PROPOSE TO FURTHER REDUCE THE CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES BUDGET TO THE TO AT TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET LEVELS. FOR SAVINGS OF TIRTY EIGHT POINT ONE MILLION. MOVING TO THE IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM THERE IS A PROPOSAL TO REDUCE IN HOME SUPPORTED SERVICE HOURS BY SEVEN PERCENT. THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS FIRST DONE IN THE GREAT RECESSION AND THAT WOULD IS ESTIMATED TO RESULT IN AN AVERAGE HOUR REDUCTION OF AROUND EIGHT HOURS PER MONTH. THERE'S ALSO PROPOSAL TO HOLD HSS COUNTY ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS TO THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY LEVELS. AT THE NEXT PROPOSAL IS IT'S- TO ALIGN I JUST AS RESIDUAL PROGRAM WITH MEDI CAL AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS CURRENTLY WIN AND I JUST LAST RECIPIENT- LOSES ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDI CAL THEY GO INTO STATE ONLY I JUST ASK PROGRAM. THIS PROPOSAL WED. ALLOW AND ENCOURAGE AND PROVIDE FOR THAT% PERSON I THEY'RE NOT TO FALL OFF OF THE MEDICAL PROGRAM THERE BY SECURING THE FEDERAL FUNDING OR IF THEY DO IN FACILITATING THEIR RETURNS THE MEDIC HEALTH PROGRAM. THE NEXT PROPOSAL IS TO CONTRACT OUT FOR AGES THAT'S PAYROLL FUNCTIONALITY THAT IS NOW DONE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL FOR A SAVINGS OF NINE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS. MOVING INTO SS I SS PETE. THERE IS A PROPOSAL TO OFFSET THE S. S. P. PORTION THE STATE'S PORTION OF THE GRANT BY THE AMOUNT THAT THE SS I PORTION WAS SCHEDULED TO INCREASE YOU WILL RECALL THAT IN JANUARY- THE SS I PORTION OF THE FEDERAL PORTION OF THE SS I SS P. GRANT. IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE- DUE TO A FEDERAL COLAC BUT THIS WOULD DO IS IT WOULD ALLOW THE STATE TO. HOLD DOWN THE STATE'S PORTION OF THE GRANTS BY DOWN TO THE FEDERALLY ALLOWABLE MINIMUM. AS A SIZE IS P. RECIPIENTS WOULD RECEIVE AN INCREASE IN THEIR TOTAL GRANT IN THE BUDGET YEAR BUT IT WOULD BE SMALLER- SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER THAN WHAT IT WAS PROJECTED TO BE IN JANUARY. MOVING INTO THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM AS WE HAVE DISCUSSED THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO GROW AT. UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS BY THE ESTIMATES OF THE ADMINISTRATION. WITH THAT COMES UP COST INCREASES IN THE EMPLOYER ASSOCIATE IT EMPLOYMENT SERVICES AND CHILD CARE. THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE A DECISION TO THAT THE NEW INDIVIDUALS COMING INTO CAL WORKS AS A RESULT OF LOSING EMPLOYMENT- DURING THE CODE NINETEEN CRISIS ARE THOSE THAT HAVE RECENTLY BEEN WORKING AND THEIR THEIR NEEDS FOR EMPLOYMENT SERVICES AND CHILD CARE MAYBE LESS. AND AS A RESULT THEY HAVEN'T BUDGETED LAST COST PER CASE. AND THAT RESULT IN SAVINGS OF SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE MILLION IN THE BUDGET YEAR. THERE'S ALSO A PROPOSAL TO SUSPEND THE CAL WORKS EXPANDED SUBSIDIZED EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT FIRST CAME ABOUT DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. IS A PROGRAM THAT LINKS HOW WORKS RECIPIENTS WITH EMPLOYERS AND SUBSIDIZES THEIR EMPLOYMENT. THIS IS AN ESTIMATED TO SAVE A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR MILLION IN THE BUDGET YEAR. THE NEXT PROPOSAL IS TO REDUCE THE HOME VISITING PROGRAM AND CAL WORKS BY THIRTY MILLION. AND TO SUSPEND THE CAL WORKS ACCOUNTABILITY AND REVIEW PROGRAM I TWENTY ONE MILLION. TURNING TO THE NEXT PAGE WE GET INTO CHILD WELFARE SERVICES. AND I WILL JUST NOTES THERE WE GOT CLARIFICATION TODAY FROM THE ADMINISTRATION THAT TWO OF THE ITEMS THAT ARE NOT MARKED AS TRIGGER REDUCTIONS ON OUR- HAND OUT ACTUALLY ARE SO I WILL NOTE THOSE AS WE GO THROUGH. SO THE FIRST PROPOSAL IS TO REDUCE RATES FOR SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL THERAPEUTIC PROGRAMS OR S. T. R. T. PIECE AS WE KNOW THEM BY FIVE PERCENT. AND THEN TO ALSO SUSPEND THE ROLLOUT OF THE LEVEL OF CARE RATE SYSTEM. UP FOR FOSTER YOUTH THIS IS THE LEVEL OF CARE RATE SYSTEM IS. HAS NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED ACROSS THE BOARD YET IT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED FOR FOSTER FAMILY AGENCIES. THIS WOULD POSTPONE ANY FURTHER IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LEVEL OF CARE RATE TOOL. AND WHAT BUT IT WOULD NOT DECREASE RATES FOR ANY CURRENT FOSTER YOUTH THIS IS ESTIMATED TO SAVE TWENTY EIGHT MILLION IN THE BUDGET YEAR. THE NEXT PROPOSAL IS TO ELIMINATE THE FOSTER FAMILY. ONLY AGENCIES SOCIAL WORKER RATE FOR SAVINGS OF FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TRIGGER REDUCTIONS THAT IS NOT MARKED ON OUR HANDS OUT THE NEXT IS TO ELIMINATE THE FAMILY URGENT RESPONSE SYSTEM WHICH WAS. A NEW PROPOSED A NEW PROGRAM- PROVIDED FOR A LAST YEAR. AND THIS IS A THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS FOR A TWENTY FOUR HOUR HOTLINE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE FOR FOSTER. FAMILIES AND YOUTH THAT ARE EXPERIENCING TRAUMA. THE NEXT PROPOSAL IS TO ELIMINATE A PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE EARLY INTERVENTION PILOT PROGRAM IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. THAT WAS ALSO PART OF LAST YEAR'S BUDGET FOR EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION GENERAL FUND. MOVING OUT INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES THERE'S A BIT OF A DIFFERENT APPROACH HERE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION TOOK. THEY ARE ASSUMING SAVINGS ARE AS THEY ARE PROPOSING SAVINGS OF THREE HUNDRED MILLION IN THE BUDGET YEAR. AND THEY'RE DOING THIS OR- OF EFFORTS- FIRST IS THROUGH SOME SOME TYPE OF RATE REDUCTION WHICH THEY INTEND TO SEEK INPUT FROM. STAKEHOLDERS IN ORDER TO DETERMINE EXACTLY WHAT THAT WOULD BE. AND THEN SEVENTY MILLION OF IT WOULD BE FROM EFFICIENCIES. THEY'RE ALSO PROPOSING TO ENFORCE A UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN IN STATUTE FOR SEVERAL YEARS BUT HAS NOT BEEN ENFORCED AND WOULD REQUIRE. ESSENTIALLY FOURTEEN DAYS A YEAR WERE PROVIDERS ARE UNABLE TO BILL. THERE IS ALSO A PROPOSAL TO REDUCE REGIONAL CENTER OPERATIONS BY THIRTY MILLION. AND IT TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT IN MEDICAID WAIVER PROGRAM SO THIS WOULD IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS WHO MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID WAIVER RATHER THAN A STATE ONLY PROGRAMS AND MOVE THEM INTO THE MEDICAID PROGRAM TO. SECURE FEDERAL PARTIAL FEDERAL FUNDING. IS A VERY HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR REDUCTION PROPOSALS INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE MAI REVISION ALSO INCLUDE SOME NEW PROPOSED AUGMENTATIONS. BUT OUR INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF THESE INDICATE THAT THEY ARE PRIMARILY AIMED TO RESPOND TO THE CODE BUT NINETEEN CRISIS. TURNING TO THE NEXT PAGE OF THE HANDOUT. AS I HAD MENTIONED WE'RE STILL IN THE VERY EARLY STAGES OF REVIEWING AND UNDERSTANDING THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. AND WE REALLY WOULD NOT HEAR THAT CASELOAD AND GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF HIS LEAD ESTIMATES IS OF KEY IMPORTANCE- THERE IS AN UNPRECEDENTED IN ESTIMATED INCREASE IN IN THE CALYX PROGRAM IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND AND TO REALLY- GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE METHODOLOGY. BECAUSE IT'S DEPEND ON THE SIZE OF THAT INCREASE THAT THAT DETERMINES THE SIZE OF THE BUDGET PROBLEM YOU'RE TRYING TO SOLVE FOR AND WHAT YOU NEED TO SOLVE FOR IT SO THAT IS OF KEY IMPORTANCE TO US AND WE ACTUALLY HAD MEETINGS OF THE ADMINISTRATION EVEN TODAY ON THAT SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. WE ENCOURAGE YOU ALSO TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT. YOU KNOW THESE ARE THESE ARE VERY DIFFICULT DECISIONS AND NOT ONES THAT YOU THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE MAKING AT THE TIME OF THE JANUARY BUDGET- SO WE THOUGHT WE WOULD TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE QUESTIONS. WE AS AN OFFICE ARE ASKING OURSELVES AS WERE DIGESTING- THESE PROPOSALS. THE FIRST IS. DOES THE PROPOSAL WHAT IMPACT AS A PROPOSAL HAVE ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. AREN'T AREN'T INDIVIDUALS PERSONAL ECONOMIC STATUS. AND WHEN POSSIBLE YOU'D WANT TO LIMIT THE PROPOSALS THAT WOULD WORK AT CROSS PURPOSES- WITH ANY OF THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE EFFORTS THAT ARE IN PLACE. AND IS THAT IT THE ADMINISTRATION AND NOT REDUCING POWER GRANTS THAT THAT'S THAT'S THE TYPE OF- PROPOSAL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON PROGRAM RECIPIENTS SO RATHER THAN ELIMINATING A PROGRAM IS THERE A WAY THAT YOU COULD HAVE A MORE TARGETED REDUCTION. TO THE PROGRAM AND MAINTAIN ITS CORE. OF WHAT IS THE LIKELIHOOD OF ACHIEVING THE SAVINGS AT IS THERE IS THERE ARE- LIKELIHOOD OF LITIGATION IS IT POSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE THE SAVINGS ARE THE FEDERAL IS THE FEDERAL FUNDING BEING MAXIMIZES THE KEY QUESTION ARE WE THINKING ALL THE FEDERAL FUNDS OUT THERE- ARE THE REDUCTIONS THAT WE HAVE. PUT FORWARD- FORFEITING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FEDERAL FUNDING. ANOTHER ANOTHER KEY QUESTION WE'RE AKING IS WHETHER OR NOT THAT THERE ARE ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES- EFFICIENCIES THAT COULD BE PUT FORWARD THAT WAS IT WOULD RESULT IN AND SAVINGS AS WELL. I IN THE IN THE MONTHS AND WEEKS DIRECTLY AFTER THAT IN MARCH AND APRIL AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY WAS VERY. PROACTIVE AND PROVIDING DIFFERENT GUIDANCE AND DIFFERENT RULES TO ALLOW SOME FLEXIBILITY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND FOR RECIPIENTS. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WE LEARN FROM THAT THAT COULD HELP STREAMLINE AND LEVY IT COST PRESSURES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. I'M NOT SOMETHING THAT WE'RE WE'RE INTERESTED IN EXPLORING- WITH THAT THAT INCLUDES THAT CONCLUDES MY- OPENING COMMENTS AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISSPELLED ON NOW I'D LIKE A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION MARCO MEECH. DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR THE- PROGRAMIN FISCAL AFFAIRS CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY.

BEHIND THEM A REVISION. I'LL START BY SAYING FIVE. AGO WE DELIVER TO YOU ABOUT YOUR PROPOSAL CLUB LOOK DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE PRESENTED TO YOU TODAY. IN JANUARY ARE BUDGET PROPOSED A RADICAL SHIFT IN THE STATE'S INVOLVEMENT TO HOUSE THE MANY AND SHELTERS PERSONS LIVING. IN CALIFORNIA BY LAUNCHING THE CALIFORNIA ACCESS TO HOUSING AND SERVICES FUND. IN JANUARY ARE BUDGET PROPOSED TO BUILD ON MAJOR INVESTMENTS MADE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS TEXT. TO EXPAND THE I. T. SEE AN INCREASE CAL WORKS GRANT BY INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS RETAIN BY FAMILIES ON CAL WORKS. IN JANUARY ARE BUDGET MADE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS TO CONTINUE THE MOMENTUM ON AFFORDABILITY AND COVERAGE ON THAT CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. SPECIFICALLY WE PROPOSED A BOLD PLANS TO ADDRESS HEALTH CARE COST TRENDS STRENGTHENED CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC OPTION LOWER PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES AND CONTINUE PROGRESS TOWARD UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE. IN JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAM FOR DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. AND MINISTER TO REGIONAL CENTERS TO INCREASE BOTH THE QUALITY OF SERVICES AND ALSO ADDRESS THE DISPARITIES AND SERVICES. HOWEVER TODAY WE FACE A RADICALLY DIFFERENT REALITY THE EFFECTS OF THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS OR WHAT WE REFER TO COVER NINETEEN. ARE UNPRECEDENTED IN MODERN TIMES. IT'S CALLED ENORMOUS HARDSHIPS FOR FAMILIES BUSINESSES GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND ESPECIALLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AS A REMINDER EIGHTY THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN INFECTED BY THIS VIRUS AND THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND TWO NEIGHBORS OF OURS HAVE PASSED AWAY FROM THIS VIRUS. SIMPLY PUT OUR LIFE HAVE CHANGED AS WE KNOW ROOM. FOR THE STATE COOPER NINETEEN HAS SWIFTLY BROUGHT ON AN ECONOMIC RECESSION AND GROWING DECLINING TAX REVENUE RAPIDLY RISING HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES CASELOAD AND BILLIONS AN ADDITIONAL COST TO COMPACT THE SPREAD OF THIS VIRUS. AS A RESULT THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT MAY REVISION AND SO DIFFERENT FROM WHERE WE WERE IN JANUARY AND TO THE ITEMS THAT I ALLUDED TO IN JUST A MOMENT AGO. IN TOTALITY THE ADMINISTRATION APPROACH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MAY REVISION BY FIRST PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH. PUBLIC SAFETY AND PUBLIC EDUCATION. BY PROVIDING ASSISTANCE TO SMALL BUSINESSES AND CALIFORNIA'S MOST HURT BY THE PANDEMIC AND BY INVESTING IN SAFE AND- INVESTING IN A SAFE AND QUICK ECONOMIC RECOVERING. WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS AND DEPARTMENTS ARE APPROACH TO DEVELOPING THEM A REVISION TO ADDRESS THE UDGET SHORTFALL WAS GUIDED BY THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPLES. FIRST WE WANTED TO PROTECT THE LIABILITY FOR PROGRAMS SECOND WE LOOK TO CANCEL OR DEFERRED NEW INITIATIVES THAT WERE PROPOSED AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN JANUARY. AND THE THIRD WE LOOK TO CANCEL OR DID REDUCE SPENDING THAT WAS ADDED TO THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACT. IN SHORT AND TO BOTTOM LINE WE WERE TRYING TO SERVE MORE PEOPLE WITH LESS SERVICES JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE IN MEDICAL PROGRAM ALONE. WE'RE PROJECTING FOURTEEN FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION BENEFICIARIES THAT'S UP TO MILLION THAT'S WHAT WE HAD IN JANUARY. IN OUR CAL WORKS PROGRAM OUR AVERAGE MONTHLY CASE MOD IS GROWING BY ONE HUNDRED AND TWO PERCENT. TO ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND CLIENTS. TOGETHER WE DID FLATTEN THE COVER NINETEEN CURVE AND SAVE LIVES NOW WE ARE CONFRONTED WITH THIS THE STEEP AN UNPRECEDENTED ECONOMICS CRISIS. WE KNOW THAT BEHIND EVERY BUDGET CUTS IS A PERSON OR A FAMILY BEING IMPACTED. AS THE GOVERNOR HAS NOTED BEFORE WE HAVE THE TALENT THE DRIVE THE DIVERSITY AND THE WORK ETHIC. NOT ONLY TO PRESERVE BEER BUT TO OVERCOME THESE UNPRECEDENTED TIMES. WE ARE STRONG OF WELL AND GENEROUS OF SPIRIT WE FACED AND FACE DOWN ON ANTICIPATED DIVERSITY AND EVERYTIME EMERGE STRONGER THAN EVER. IT TRULY IS CALIFORNIA STORY AND IT THIS IS THE BILL THE LATEST CHAPTER IN THAT STORY. SO I THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE PURE BEFORE YOU YOU AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE TO. THANK YOU MISTER MEET THANK YOU MISTER BEACH AND NOW I'D LIKE TO ASK FOR THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ADAM DORSEY WHO IS JOINING US FROM THE WITNESS VIDEO ROOM TO PLEASE PROVIDE US WITH ANY ADDITIONAL FRAMING AND PERSPECTIVE THAT YOU CAN REGARDING THE MAY REVISION. MISTER DORSEY IS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS PROGRAM BUDGET MANAGER FOR THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES MISTER DORSEY PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THE GROUP ID NINETEEN PANDEMIC IS CAUSED ENORMOUS HARDSHIP FOR FAMILIES BUSINESSES AND GOVERNMENTS ACROSS THE WORLD. IT IS IN DANGER HELP STRESS THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND CAUSED DEVASTATING LOSSES IN FAMILY AND BUSINESS AND GO. CALIFORNIA'S PRUDENT FISCAL MANAGEMENT INCLUDING IT STRUCTURALLY BALLOTS BUDGET AND RECORD RESERVES PUTS IT IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION THAN OTHER GOVERNMENTS TO CONTEND WITH THESE CHALLENGES. HOWEVER THE EFFECT OF THE KOBE RECESSION ON THE STATE BUDGET ARE MASSIVE. SUBSTANTIAL FEDERAL ASSISTANCE IS ESSENTIAL TO SAFEGUARD CORE GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS AS WELL AS TO SUPPORT A SAFE AND QUICK ECONOMIC RECOVERY. THE DOUBLE THE REVISION REALLY ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS THESE BUDGET SHORTFALLS. BUT MAINTAIN A WOULD YOU BILLION FOR CORE SERVICES. AND THERE ARE DIFFICULT DECISIONS WOULD NEED TO BE MADE- BUT THAT IS THE WAY THAT THIS BUDGET HAS BEEN STRUCTURED TRY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES I. PLAN TO GO INTO MORE DETAIL ABOUT SOME OF THE INDIVIDUAL- ITEMS IN THE BUDGET BUT THIS BILL THAT THE ONLY DID SUCH A GOOD JOB GOING THROUGH- A LOT OF THOSE ISSUES THAT- I THINK I'LL JUST AND MY COMMENTS THERE AND- HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER DORSEY. NOW I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN IT UP FOR- MEMBERS TO ASK QUESTIONS OF THIS PANEL BEFORE WE MOVE ON AND WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN WITH- ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO WHO HAS A QUESTION FOR THE LA L.

PEAS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE SERVICES FOR THEM HOW ARE WE GOING TO ENSURE THAT FINDING IS- I GUESS SWITCHED FROM THE JUVENILE SYSTEM INTO THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM SO THAT THE- IF THEY HAVE A BIGGER CASELOAD BECAUSE OF THE JUVENILE SYSTEM BEING. DISMANTLED THAT THESE KIDS ARE GETTING THE PROPER- SERVICES I INSTEAD OF JUST CUTTING THE BUDGET- WHERE ARE THOSE KIDS GOING TO GOAL AND HOWEVER ARE RETAIN IT ARE WE GOING TO INCREASE THE BUDGET FOR THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. I THINK IT'S A YOU'VE HAD ON ONE OF THE OTHER CRITERIA THAT WE ARE THINKING ABOUT WITH EACH OF THESE PROPOSALS. IS ONE ABOUT COST SHIFTING AND MAKING SURE THAT WHEN THERE ARE REDUCTIONS THAT WE ALSO THINK ABOUT. WHERE THE SHIFT MAY BE AND WHETHER THAT'S TO OTHER STATE DEPARTMENT OR OTHER LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT IS ON OUR MINDS- YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION IS NOT ONE THAT I HAVE AN ANSWER TO YOU ABOUT AB FROM ON THAT FROM THE JUVENILE HALL SYSTEM IS SOMETHING THAT I WILL TAKE BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES.

IN THE YEARS PAST ALL OF THE UNFUNDED PROCESSES THAT WERE THAT WERE IN PLACE AND THEN THIS LAST YEAR THE RATE STUDY WAS PROVIDED. THE SHOW A TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR UNDER FUNDING. OF SERVICES TO THE POPULATION OR DEFERRED SERVICES FUNDING. SO HERE WE GO MOVING FORWARD. LOOKING AT THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF CUTS. WHAT THE CENSUS CONTINUES TO GROW BY 2225% OVER TEN YEARS. OF THE POPULATION. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ATTRITION RATE OF MARRIAGE BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE DUE TO THE- OF STRAIN. OF UP ADDITIONAL OF CARE NEEDED FOR THE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE ADD OR SPECIAL NEEDS WHEN DO WE WHEN WE ASSUME. THAT TO THE LANHAM ACT THAT THE STANDARD OF CARE THE SUPPORT THAT IS DESERVED. OF THE POPULATION WHOSE YOU KNOW DEPENDING ON US ONLY US. TO PROVIDING QUALITY OF LIFE SUSTAINABILITY AND HOPE FOR ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE HOLD DEAR. AND BUT EVERY TIME THAT WE COME TO SOME KIND OF SITUATION LIKE THIS. WE CUT THEM. AND THERE. THIS JUST SEEMS LIKE WE THAT'S OUR GO TO. AND I'M LOOKING FOR ANSWERS. NUMBER ONE. WHERE DO THE HEALTH PLANS COME IN. WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR EIGHT POINT SOMETHING BILLION DOLLARS THAT WE FUND TO THE REGIONAL CENTERS. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE OBLIGATION OF HELPING ISN'T IN THESE INDIVIDUALS. IS HOW MUCH TO THE HEALTH PLANS HELP US IN THIS IN THIS POPULATION. AND SHOULD THEY HAVE TO STEP UP. BECAUSE IT IS A DUALLY DIAGNOSED DISABILITY. AND OTHER FACETS OF HEALTH CARE IT'S FUND. FULLY BUT YET WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS POPULATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHO HAVE. EXTRAORDINARY NEEDS OR MEDICALLY FRAGILE. AND LOOK AT. SOCIETY AS A WHOLE WHEN WE LOOK AT THEM AND WE WANT TO CRACK CREATE INCLUSIVE. TOGETHERNESS WITH THIS POPULATION NO WE HAVE UNEMPLOYMENT WHICH IS 83% THE SPECIALIST POPULATION WHERE DO WE WHERE DO WE GO I MEAN WHEN DO WE STOP TECHNOLOGY I MEAN WE DID IT WITH PROP NINETY EIGHT WITH EDUCATION WE GAVE A STANDARD OF FUNDING THAT WAS. EXPECTED BY THE LEGISLATURE. AND BY THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA TO FULLY FUND TO PROP NINETY EIGHT STANDARDS FOR EDUCATION. WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO. TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS NEED DOES NOT GO AWAY BUT YEAH IT GROWS. OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. AND I'M JUST LOOKING FOR SOME SOLUTIONS WITH. MY COLLEAGUES HERE ON THIS COMMITTEE- BECAUSE BECOMES FRUSTRATING AT A POINT WHERE AS- WE MAKE SOME GAMES WE DID SOME SIGNIFICANT GAINS WITH MR TING LASHER OF FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. AND THEN WE TAKE TWO STEPS FORWARD. AND THREE BACK. AND YOU KNOW I'M SEEING THE THREE TO FIVE YEAR OLDS ARE NOT PICKED UP AGAIN. THIS IS THE MOST INFLUENTIAL. TIME OF THESE PEOPLE THESE THESE LITTLE GUYS LIVES THE WHERE THEY CAN BE THE MOST PRODUCTIVE IN IN THEIR GAMES. AND I NEED TO KNOW. I MEAN WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL THE THINGS. BROUGHT UP HERE HOW CAN WE. MAKE A COMMITMENT TO THIS POPULATION. AND WALK AWAY HERE FROM THIS. PROCESS KNOWING WE DID OUR BEST WE DID OUR BEST FOR THIS POPULATION BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ANYBODY BUT US. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER I BELIEVE- AND KNOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN A LONG TERM CHAMPION FOR THIS GROUP. AND WANT YOUR QUESTION TO BE DIRECTED AT DIRECTOR BARGE MEN IF SHE'S AVAILABLE. HI. HI THIS IS NANCY PARCHMENT. PERFECT I. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER FOR THAT THAT- QUESTION AND THE CONCERNED FOR OUR POPULATION- I I'D LIKE TO JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THE STRATEGIES AND CERTAINLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE CHALLENGE THAT YOU KNOW OUR FAMILIES HAVE FACED OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS AND CERTAINLY DURING THE TIME IN WHICH WE HAD REDUCTIONS IN PRIOR YEARS AND THE FORTITUDE OF OUR OUR COMMUNITY REALLY PULLED TOGETHER BACK IN EIGHT OH NINE TAKING A LOOK AT HOW WE CAN REALLY TAKE- THE STRONG STRATEGY IS RECOGNIZING THE IMPACT TO OUR COMMUNITY IS ONE THAT WE DON'T TAKE LIGHTLY- I A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I WANT TO JUST SHARE WITH YOU WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE- THE APPROACH TO. IDENTIFYING THE COST SAVING MEASURES THERE'S A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE WANTED TO PUT AS A PRIORITY AND MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE VERY SENSITIVE TO AND MAKING SME OF THE VERY DIFFICULT DECISIONS- IN LOOKING AT THE WORK WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE VERY SENSITIVE TO THE UNDERSERVED POPULATION AND SO WITH EACH OF THE STRATEGIES THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT WE WANTED TO BE MINDFUL OF THE LOWER. INCOME FAMILIES THAT MAY BE RECEIVING IMPACTS FROM AND NEVER NUMBER OF THE STRATEGIES THAT ARE HAVING TO BE ADDRESSED IN BEING RESPONSIVE TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND THE AFFECTING RECESSION AND ECONOMIC IMPACT YOU KNOW IN THAT AREA AND SO WHAT WHEN WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT THE PROPOSALS THAT WE PUT FORWARD YOU KNOW IN A COST SHARING WERE IDENTIFYING THE COST SHARING AND REDUCING THE IMPACT TO THE LOWER INCOME FAMILY WELL TAKING A LOOK AT THAT THE STRATEGIES INTO A KIND OF THOUGHT. OF IT TAYLOR UP YOU KNOW YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER TALKED ABOUT WITH OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS AND REALLY DATA OVER THE YEARS ROCKY THE ON. THE RATE REDUCTION. LOOKING OUT OF. THAT IS MORE ABOUT- IDENTIFYING SOMETHING THAT'S NOT ACROSS THE BOARD BUT USING THAT RATE STUDY TO HELP INFORM US FOR A PAYMENT REDUCTION. CERTAINLY WE RECOGNIZE THAT HAVING TO WORK WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS ON STRATEGIES WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT- THE PAYMENTS. FROM REDUCTION AT TWO OUT YEARS WHAT IS THE WORK THAT WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE WERE WORKING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS TO IDENTIFY. THOSE STRATEGIES AS WE DID IN EIGHT OR NINE SO WHILE CURRENT YEAR WE DO. NEED TO MAKE A VERY STRONG PROPOSAL TO MEETING- THE IMMEDIATE NEED. IN THE ARE BUDGET YOU'RE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT REALLY WANT TO HAVE A FULLY ENGAGE CONVERSATION WITH OUR COMMUNITY AS TO WHAT OF THOSE. THOSE THINGS THAT WE REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT FOR A FUTURE. AS TO HOW TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT YOU'RE BRINGING UP- ONE OF THE AREAS THAT- ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER THAT YOU HAD TALKED ABOUT WE'VE HEARD FROM MARK- I NEVER STAKEHOLDERS TO IS HOW DO WE- LOOK AT OTHER RESOURCES SO NOT ONLY AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE MAXIMIZING THE FEDERAL. PARTICIPATION BUT LOOKING AT THAT GENERIC RESOURCES THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE IN THIS SERVICE COORDINATION AND THE- SYSTEM CORD NATION IF YOU WILL. BETWEEN OUR OTHER SYSTEMS TO SUPPORT OUR FAMILIES. I'LL GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES SO WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE FEDERAL FUNDING. YEAH THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS WE'VE IDENTIFIED WAYS THAT WE CAN ENHANCE OUR ADMINISTRATIVE FEDERAL FUNDING WE'VE IDENTIFIED WAYS THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO MAXIMIZE. THE PARTICIPANTS ON ON MEDI CAL THROUGH INSTITUTIONAL DENEEN YOU KNOW BUT ALSO TAKING A LOOK AT HOW DO WE ACCESS TO GENERIC RESOURCES THROUGH HEALTH PLANS. LIKELY DURING TRAINING WITH THE SERVICE COORDINATORS AT THE REGIONAL CENTER TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE- EQUIPPED WITH THE TOOLS TO SUPPORT A FAMILY MEMBER. IN ACCESSING THOSE RESOURCES BUT ALL THE WHILE PROVIDING A LEVEL OF A SAFETY NET- TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR MOST VULNERABLE ARE RECEIVING THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. TO HAVE INSURANCE OF SUPPORTS IN ADDRESSING- THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUALS WORDS AS WELL AS THE EMERGENT NEEDS- RELATED TO HEALTH AND SAFETY. WE HAVE NOT ELIMINATED OUR STATUTE THAT ALLOWS US TO- PROVIDE SOME HEALTH AND SAFETY- AS FAR AS ALL OF OUR HEALTH AND SAFETY WAIVERS THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE REMAIN AS A SAFETY NET TO OUR FAMILIES. YOU KNOW WELL WE DO HAVE SOME SAID STRATEGIES THAT ARE PUT FORWARD THAT ARE- CERTAINLY SENSITIVE- WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE ABLE TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE- INDIVIDUALS THAT WE SERVE IN THE BEST WAY THAT WE CANNOT. WITH THOSE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO US- WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY ARE SELF ADVOCATES THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS THE OTHER AT OTHER OUT BECAUSE THAT THAT ARE PASSIONATELY ADVOCATING FOR POPULATION AND IDENTIFYING. WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO DO THAT IS CREATIVE IN APPROACHING SERVICES. I'M LEARNED A LOT THROUGH. HOPE NINETEEN AND ARE SO. TO BE **** AND INNOVATIVE AND THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE WANT TO EXPLORE AND SEE ARE THERE SOME LONGER TERM STRATEGIES THAT WILL BE. A BENEFIT TO OUR SYSTEM- AND CERTAINLY TELE SERVICE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES AND THOSE ARE ALL THE THINGS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE EXPLORED IN THE COMING WEEKS IN THE COMING MONTHS- AND LOOK FORWARD TO. ENGAGE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER THANK YOU DIRECTOR MARGIN SO ESSENTIALLY BASED ON THE OTHER LINE THAT YOU'VE PROVIDED WHAT DIRECT SERVICES WILL BE. REMOVED OR NOT PROVIDED TO THE ID POPULATION AT THIS POINT THAT THEY WERE ONCE GETTING. SO THINKING OF THE AGAIN NANCY PARCHMENT DIRECTOR DDS- THE SERVICES THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE RECEIVING WE'VE NOT ELIMINATED I'M TRYING TO THINK BACK AND I'LL HAVE TO CORRECTIVE IF I AM INCORRECT BUT WE'RE NOT ELIMINATING THE SERVICE SO WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE- MOVING FORWARD WITH THE PAYMENT REDUCTIONS FOR SERVICES IT'S NOT ELIMINATION OF THE SERVICE- BUT IT IS A PAYMENT REDUCTION TO THE SERVICE PROVIDERS PROVIDING THE SERVICES- WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT. REDUCING THE REGIONAL CENTER OPERATIONS- WE ARE ADDING IN THE END SOME FLEXIBILITY FOR THEM IN MANAGING THEIR CASELOAD AS IT'S BEEN NOTED THAT WE HAD A GROWTH IN OUR OUR CASELOAD EACH YEAR- PRIOR YEAR IT'S BEEN BETWEEN FIFTEEN TO EIGHTEEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS EACH YEAR- WE DO HAVE INCLUDED IN. THE I MAY REVISE THE FUNDING TO GO FOR THOSE CASELOAD- SUPPORTS AND SO THE SERVICE COORDINATOR CASELOAD WOULD STILL BE SUPPORTED THROUGH THAT WHILE THEY DO HAVE A- THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR PROJECTED GENERAL FUND DECREASE- WE HAVE AS I INDICATED AND INCLUDED SOME ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY IS FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO PRIORITIZE AS YOU HAD MENTIONED. THE EARLY INTERVENTION SIDE OF THE CHILDREN WHO ARE MOVING FROM EARLY START INTO SCHOOL AGE SO THE REGIONAL CENTERS EED TO DO SOME- MANAGEMENT TO CASELOAD WAITING SO INCREASING- THE- SERVICE COORDINATOR TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR SERVICE COORDINATOR RATIOS ARE RESPONSIVE TO THE YOUNGER KIDS. REGIONAL CENTERS WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO MATCH THAT AND THEN IDENTIFY THOSE AREAS IN WHICH AB ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO SERVICE COORDINATION- MAY BE APPROPRIATE TO STOP ME. ONE EXAMPLE THAT IS THAT REGIONAL CENTERS KANSEN TO DEPARTMENT AND ALTERNATE CASELOAD RATIO OR SERVICE COORDINATION. SO IF THEY SEE THAT THEY HAVE A- PARTICULAR POPULATION THAT THEY CAN MAKE PHONE CALLS OR DO REMOTE SERVICES OVER- A COUPLE TIMES A YEAR. AND THAT WOULD MEET THEIR NEEDS THAT WOULD MEAN THAT A SERVICE COORDINATOR COULD HAVE A HIGHER CASELOAD RATIO AS COMPARED TO MAYBE. THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED A MORE INTENSIVE SUPPORT. SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT- AS FAR AS NOT BEING ABLE TO GET SERVICES WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY. YOU KNOW WHAT ARE GOING TO BE THE GAPS- BY- THE STRATEGIES THAT WE'RE PUTTING FORWARD IN PROPOSALS WERE PUTTING FORWARD- BUT AT THIS TIME WE'RE NOT IDENTIFIED ANYTHING THAT IS A SERVICE THAT'S BEING ELIMINATED. AND JUST ONE MORE QUESTION. SO WE. UP TO THIS POINT BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC WE DID HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ATTAINING- THROUGH THE PROVIDERS ENOUGH MANPOWER TO SERVICE THE POPULATION AND IF WE DID WAS A HUGE TURN OVER THERE WAS A CONTEST YOU KNOW WE HAD- EQUITY PROBLEMS THAT WE YOU KNOW WE DIDN'T PAY WELL IN THIS IN THIS YOU KNOW MINIMUM WAGE WHEN WE HAVE. OF SUCH OF THE QUALITY OF CARE THAT'S NEEDED- ALMOST LIKE A- KIND OF A NURSING ASSISTANT KIND OF ROLE WITH MEDICALLY FRAGILE AND ALL OF THE THINGS WE'VE DISCUSSED- GOING FORWARD. WE STILL HAVE THAT NECESSITY FOR WHEN YOU HAVE THE PURCHASE OF SERVICES THROUGH THE PROVIDER OF EITHER THE RESPITE INDIVIDUAL OR OR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BEHAVIORAL YOU KNOW HEALTH AND YEAH. HE A NECESSITY FOR ANYTHING THAT THAT THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS TO SUCH A WIDE VARIETY OF NEEDS. AND YOU KNOW GOING FORWARD IN TRYING TO GET A POPULATION OF WORK FOR HER WALK WORK FORCE THAT CAN ACTUALLY BE EFFECTIVE. AND NOT HAVE A TRANSITION- OR TURN OVER HAS BEEN A PROBLEM GOING FOR NOW NO WITH THIS. DO YOU FORESEE. IT BEING PROBLEMATIC GOING FORWARD ARE WE STEPPING BACK IN OUR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO ATTAIN THIS WORKFORCE OR DO WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD PLANNED TO BE ABLE TO. MAKE THAT INVESTMENT GOING FORWARD IN SOME FORM OR FASHION TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE THE CARE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER THAT WE ARE AND I'M PRESIDENT OF TIME. SO TO SAY WHAT WE CAN FOR SEE- I WILL TELL YOU THAT IT IS GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE TO KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT. IS GOING TO CAN BE OUR NEW NORMAL AND I SAY THAT ONLY BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST WITH THE- COALBED PUBLIC HEALTH RECESSION BUT IT ALSO HAS TO DO WITH HOW ARE WE GOING TO BE DELIVERING SERVICES SO WE HAVE TO HAVE A COLLABORATIVE DISCUSSION AND SAY. YOU KNOW WHAT IS THIS LOOK LIKE SO EVEN TRYING TO OPEN UP SERVICES- POST YOU KNOW THIS THE NEXT FEW% MONTHS AND THE NEXT. YOU KNOW ME EVEN WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR SO IN IN ACCESSING CONGREGATE SETTING IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE DONE WITH A LOT OF CARE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE SMART ABOUT IT AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT PUTTING PEOPLE AT RISK. AND ARE YOU I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WE STARTED THIS ALREADY WITH OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS AND WITH SOME OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND WE NEED TO DO THIS AS WELL WITH OUR SELF ADVOCATES. AS WE'RE LOOKING AT A RESIDENTIAL SERVICES AND ACCESS SEEN DAY SERVICES IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE STEPS IN THE INDICATORS YOU KNOW SIMILAR TO YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THOSE THAT THE SMART WORK IS BEING DONE FOR THE STATE YOU KNOW HOW TO WE ALSO BE SENSITIVE TO THOSE HIGH RISK NEEDS IF YOU WERE JUST INDICATING. INDIVIDUALS OF COMPLEX MEDICAL NEEDS AS AN EXAMPLE YOU KNOW WILL WIN IS THAT DAY THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO SAY SOMEBODY WHO HAS. CONGER GET DAY SETTING IT MAY BE AWHILE SO HOW DO WE CAN TO REALLY DEFINE THAT SERVICE FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL AND WE NEED TO DEAL DEBT THAT ALONG WITH. CHANGING HOW WE MOVE FORWARD AND ALSO A ECONOMIC RECESSION SO. I WISH I HAD IT A REALLY CLEAR ANSWER THAT'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO SAY THIS IS EXACTLY HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT THIS IS WHERE OUR GAPS ARE GOING TO BE AND THIS IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO MITIGATE THOSE REST. BUT WE NEED TO HAVE BEEN ENGAGE CONVERSATION WITH OUR COMMUNITY WE NEED TO IDENTIFY THOSE VALUES AND PRINCIPLES THAT ARE THE PRIORITY FOR DELIVERING SERVICES START IDENTIFYING HOW WE CAN KEEP PEOPLE SAFE AND THEN START USING YOU KNOW OUR OUR WORK TOGETHER AS A COMMUNITY. AND TO WHAT OTHER STEPS AND THEN WHAT IT DOES THE ACTIONS THAT WE NEED TO TAKE TO MAKE SURE WE CAN A PROVIDE SERVICES AND BE MINIMIZED THE REST- SO WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER ON THIS I MEAN THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE COMMUNITY THAT'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN- IT'S NOT GOING TO B DONE WITHOUT. SOME CHALLENGES OBVIOUSLY AND- WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE FREQUENT CONVERSATIONS AND- IMPLEMENT SOME IMMEDIATE STRATEGIES TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE ECONOMIC RECESSION- BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO COLLABORATE TO IDENTIFY HOW DO WE HAVE THAT SAFETY NET. AND THEN WHAT IS OUR LONGER TERM STRATEGY. THANK YOU DIRECTOR BIRDMAN- WE ARE GOING TO NOW MOVE ON TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS FOLLOWED BY CHAIR TING. DIRECTOR BARGE MEN- MY QUESTION IS IN RELATION WITH THE RATIO SEVERAL OF OUR OUR PROGRAMS AS YOU MENTIONED AND AS MR FRAZIER DIMENSION. IS THERE GOING TO BE FLEXIBILITY TO MOVE SOME OF THESE RATIOS SAY FROM A OF. ONE THREE TO LIKE A ONE FOUR- SO WE CAN HAVE THE PROVIDERS CAN HAVE THE ABILITY TO CUT AND SAVE ON THE BUDGETS BUT YET KEEP SERVICES AND PROGRAMS RUNNING IS THAT BEING LOOKED AT AND IS OUR PROBABILITY OF THAT HAPPENING. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS WIT. THE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES TO HELP PROVIDE SOME FLEXIBILITY IS FOR- SERVICE PROVIDERS IN THE DELIVERY OF THEIR SERVICE IS DEFINITELY A STRATEGY THAT WE HAD DISCUSSIONS FOR AND PRIOR RECESSIONS- AND I THINK THAT IS CERTAINLY GOING TO BE PART OF OUR ACTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR PROVIDERS- WE WILL BE MEETING WITH OUR DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES TASK FORCE THIS WEEK TUESDAY IT TO HAVE THE INITIAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT DIFFERENT STRATEGIES. AND I WOULD WELCOME IDEAS SUCH AS THAT AND OTHERS TO BE ABLE TO PRIORITIZE TO HELP THE PROVIDERS BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE WITH THE CHANGES THAT ARE COMING FORWARD WITH- PAYMENT REDUCTION IF ADOPTED AND IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO LOOK AT AS FAR AS PUTTING THOSE ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGE LEE WAYS AND- BUDGET TRAILER BILL OR IS THAT SOMETHING YOU'RE ABLE TO HANDLE FROM THE DEPARTMENT DIRECTLY. YEAH WE WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY THOSE ARE THE CONVERSATIONS WERE GOING TO HAVE AND TALKING THROUGH. HOW WE WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE STEPS YOU KNOW TO LOOK AT THE SERVICE DELIVERY WITH THAT WOULD BE ASSOCIATED SAY WITH THE PAYMENT pGENERAL. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THAT WOULD BE AND HOW USING TELE SERVICE SO WE'RE GONNA BE SUBMITTING A I REQUEST AN APPLICATION- TO OUR WAVERED AMENDMENT TO OUR- FEDERAL WAIVER. TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND TELE SERVICE AND DIFFERENT STUDY. SO WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE HAVING THAT CONVERSATION IT WOULD NOT NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE AN TRAILER BILL SPECIFICALLY WHILE THE WEEK THIS PARTICULAR ONE WE DO HAVE INCLUDED- BUT I AM- AS WE ALWAYS HAVE BEEN VERY OPEN TO WORKING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS AND- IDENTIFYING THOSE STRATEGIES TO BE ABLE TO- IMPLEMENTS. POLICY IN THE LAST UNSAFE SAFEST WAY. YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WAS OPEN TO ASK LA- A QUESTION ABOUT THE ON SPREAD SHEET THE PAGE ONE OF THEIR ANALYSIS. IF YOU CAN. THE PARTICULAR SHE CAN WALK THROUGH THE CAL WORKS LINE ITEM. THIS IS A QUESTION THIS IS A QUESTION FOR AWHILE. CERTAINLY CERTAINLY SO WHAT YOU'RE SEEING HERE IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATE OF THE CHARACTER GENERAL FUND PRESSURE. THAT IT WILL EXPERIENCE IT'S PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN ESTIMATED CASELOAD BOTH IN THE CURRENT YEAR IN THE BUDGET YEAR SO THE CURRENT YEAR THEY'RE ESTIMATING ABOVE JANUARY A 10% INCREASE IN THEIR CASE LOAD. BUT IN IN FOR THE BUDGET YEAR THEY'RE ESTIMATING AND OVER A 100% INCREASE COMPARED TO MAN THE CASELOAD THAT'S REALLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THE OTHER THING IS THAT WE ALL HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND WITH HOW WORKS IS THAT. IT'S FUNDED BY A COMBINATION OF FUNDS SO. THE FUNDING YOU SEE HERE THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO SPEND. GENERAL FUND ON IT BUT ALSO ASK THE MONEY FROM THE- FROM THERE HUMAN SERVICES RESERVE TO COVER AT FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION AND ALSO FROM THE CAR CORONA ROBOT THAT CORRECT CRF CURRENT NO RELIEF FIND TO FIND TO COVER THOSE COSTS IN A CAREER IN THE BUDGET YEAR. BUT AGAIN IT'S PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF INCREASED CASELOAD WHICH THENHAS INCREASES IN EMPLOYMENT SERVICES AND OTHER- SERVICES IN THE CALYX PROGRAM. IN AND JUST TO CLARIFY THAT THE MONTHLY EXPENDITURE SO FOR MANY OF. ON NOT FOR. RIGHT OTHER OTHER AT THEIR ANNUAL ANNUAL COSTS. ANNUAL OKAY SO THE SEARCH SO THE Q. MILLIONS YEAH IT'S ACUMEN OF NUMBER SO MAY IS A ONE BILLION DOLLARS CUMULATIVE. THAT'S ALL THAT THAT'S SHOWING ACTUALLY IS IT'S SHOWING YOU UP IN TOTAL WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATE WOULD BE THAT THE GENERAL FUND COST OF CAL WORKS IN JANUARY WHICH IS FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN MILLION FOR THE WHOLE YEAR. AND THEN NOW WHAT IS OUR UPDATED ESTIMATE ANTHONY REVISION YEAH I SEE OKAY. THANK YOU FOR THE JANUARY THE MAY ARMORED ARE REFERENCING THE REVISIONS IN THE BUDGET PROPOSAL OKAY. SO THEY'RE NOT GOING SO HOME THEY'RE PROPOSING A ALMOST QUADRUPLING OF. CAL WORKS SO ONE FROM ONE BILLION TO ALMOST FOUR BILLION DOLLARS ON THAT OBVIOUSLY PUT SIGNIFICANT COST PRESSURE ON EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE HUMAN SERVICES BUDGET. ON DO YOU DO YOU FEEL THAT THAT IS FAIRLY ACCURATE OR THAT TO ME THAT SEEMS FAIRLY HIGH ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT CAL WORKS NOT EVEN THE EASIEST PROGRAM IN THE WORLD TO GET ON TO. IT DID STAND OUT TO US THAT AS A REMARKABLE INCREASE AGAIN WE'RE IN THE VERY EARLY STAGES OF LOOKING AT IT WE HAVE. HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND WE ARE LEARNING MORE- BUT WE DEFINITELY HAVE MORE QUESTIONS- ESPECIALLY- OR ONE OF OUR KEY QUESTIONS IS HOW IT INTERACTS WITH THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM. AND HOW IF INDIVIDUALS HAVE RECENTLY LOST EMPLOYMENT WITH THEY ENTER- THE UNEMPLOYMENT SYSTEM AT THE SAME TIME AS CAL WORKS AND IF SO. WITH THAT HOW WOULD THAT AFFECT THEIR AVERAGE GRANT SO EVEN IF THEY ARE AND BOTH PROGRAMS WITH WITH THEIR COFFEE LAST SO WE HAVE A- YEAH BUT A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS RELATED TO THAT ALONG THE SAME LINES THAT YOU'RE ASKING. SINCE SOME OF THOSE WE DON'T HAVE CLARITY WHETHER OR NOT. PEOPLE WHO ARE UNEMPLOYED BUT GO ON UNEMPLOYMENT FIRST AND THEN ON CAL WORKS. AT SOMETHING WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK INTO AS WELL- ESTIMATE ASSUMES THAT IT WOULD BE CONCURRENT ARE NOT. AND A LACK OF THIRTY IS MORE RELATED TO JUST NOT HAVING ENOUGH TIME SINCE THAT THE MAYOR VISION TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT WITH THEM BUT WE ARE WORKING WITH THEM AND THEY- THEY MET WITH US JUST AS RECENTLY AS TODAY AS WELL. GREAT SO IF I IF I COULD SPEAK TO EITHER FINANCE OR- WHICH OF REPRESENTED FROM THE MINISTRATION ON THE CAL WORKS NUMBER. I'M SURE WERE MISTER DORSEY. WE'LL IS. I'M SORRY SO SORRY I GUESS THE QUESTION IF YOU COULD YOU WALK US THROUGH THE METHODOLOGY ON THE QUADRUPLE THE IN ALMOST 40% INCREASE FROM ON THIS FISCAL YEAR TO NEXT FISCAL YEAR HOW YOU. ARRIVED AT IT. YEAH ALL START AND THEN I CAN- HANDED OFF THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES THAT THIS IS ADAM DORSEY FINANCE. SO YEAH I MEAN. WE TRIED TO DO IS TAKE A LOOK AT HISTORICAL IMPACT OF UNEMPLOYMENT ON ON CASE LOAD AND- TRIED AS BEST WE CAN TO TRY TO APPLY THAT TO TODAY'S SITUATION- A KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU KNOW EVERY ESTIMATE IS NOT GOING TO BE SPOT ON- BUT THIS IS A VERY VERY DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT TO. JUST SORT OF MAKE THESE PROJECTIONS AND- THIS IS KIND OF WHERE WE THINK IT'S GOING TO IT'S GOING TO BE OVER THE COURSE OF THAT TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEAR. PRETTY THAT CAN YOU GIVE US. A LITTLE MORE DETAIL. WHAT WAS WHAT WAS THE METHODOLOGY YOU WENT TO REACH THIS BECAUSE- BECAUSE YOU'RE BASICALLY ASKING US TO CUT THREE ALMOST THREE BILLION DOLLARS OUT OF THE- REST THE BUDGET BECAUSE OF YOUR ESTIMATE. I THINK THAT'S ONE WAY OF LOOKING AT IT THE OTHER WAY OF LOOKING AT IT IS THAT WE'RE ASKING TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE PEOPLE THAT WE THINK ARE GONNA COME INTO THE COLLEGE PROGRAM OVER THE NEXT YEAR RIGHT. AT WHAT IF I DON'T I'M NOT MISTER DORSEY. WELL NOW WOULD BE. AND WE LOCAL THESE CUTS AND- ALL WE HAVE IS MONEY IN THE BANK FOR SERVICES WHEN. YOU KNOW WE HAVE SO MANY SENIORS WITH MANY FAMILIES NOT GETTING SERVICES. AND THEN THE STATE'S GOT MONEY IN THE BANK WHICH I REALLY DIDN'T. THE NEEDS OF THEIR NEEDS NEEDED THE MONEY TO BE HELPING THESE FAMILIES AND- THESE INDIVIDUALS. SURE YEAH I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THAT CONCERN- WE SHARE IT- AND- CERTAINLY WILL BE DOING OUR BEST TO UPDATE THESE PROJECTIONS AS YOU KNOW AS- YOU CAN BE FOUND COULD YOU WALK ME THROUGH HOW YOU GOT TO THE FOR BILLING. I'M ALL HANDED OVER TO SOCIAL SERVICES SEE IF THEY'VE GOTTEN MORE DETAIL. THERE'S A LOT OF DETAIL. GOOD AFTERNOON MR TING MRS CHEN TRYING. TO DECEIVE HI NICE TO SEE YOU AS WELL- THAT THEY INCREASE THAT YOU'RE SEEING IS THE RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN THE CASE CLOSELY AT FIVE. AND MORE SPECIFICALLY THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES WHO WE EXPECT TO BE ACCESSING THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE JUMPED FROM TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY PROJECTION OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND SLIGHTLY OVER TWO SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FAMILIES- AND THAT'S WHAT'S DRIVING THE COST INCREASE IN THE PROGRAM. WE'RE LOOKING FOR AN APPLICATION TRENDS AND ECONOMIC TRENDS AND UNEMPLOYMENT. AND THEN DRIVING FORWARD TO THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES WE EXPECT TO BE COMING IN THE DOOR AND YOU NEED TO SERVE. GOD IN APPRECIATE SO SOLDIERS JUST TO REPEAT WHAT I THOUGHT WHAT E JUST DID WAS. ON THE ESTIMATE IS WE HAVE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FAMILIES FORTY THOUSAND FAMILIES AROUND NOW. POTENTIALLY SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND FAMILIES. ABOUT BIRTH I GUESS I'M JUST OF TRYING TO STAY ON THE BUDGET MATH BECAUSE THAT'S NOT QUITE A DOUBLING BUT THE BUDGETS A QUADRUPLING SO IS IT BECAUSE YOU ANTICIPATE MORE. FAMILIES WITH MOM MANY MORE CHILDREN OR- I'M NOT SURE I DIDN'T I HAVE NOT HAD THE ELLIE OWES CHART PREVIOUSLY TO BE ABLE TO TRY TO IDENTIFY THAT I THINK PART OF WHAT COULD BE COMPLICATING THE PICTURE HERE AND WE CAN WORK WITH THEM MORE TO TRY TO IDENTIFY IF THIS IS THE CASE. IS THAT THE GENERAL FUND AND HANNAH FUNDS ARE FAIRLY FUNGIBLE AND SO HOW MUCH WE- ADJUST THE BUDGET THAT LOOKS LIKE GENERAL FUND VERSUS THE WAY THAT WE ARE APPLYING OUR TANNER FUNDS WHICH ARE. ARE HISTORICALLY ALSO TRANSFERRED TO OTHER PROGRAMS AND WE'LL BE BACK TO SOME EXTENT IN THE PUBLIC PROGRAMS COULD BE COMPLICATING A LITTLE BIT THE PICTURE. SO WE CAN WORK WITH THEM TO TRY TO CROSS REFERENCE ALL OF MINE ARE VARIOUS STARTS AND FIGURE OUT WHAT IS. AN ACTUAL INCREASE IN WHAT IS A HOT SHOWING UP THAT WAY. GREAT AND I THINK I THINK OUR OUR OBJECT. WE WANNA TRY TO AS I DEARLY ANTICIPATE CASELOAD AS POSSIBLE BIRD GIVE GIVE BRING- A TIME WE HAVE SO MANY FAMILIES SUFFERING THE SOMEBODY POPULATIONS ON THIS CHART GETTING CAUGHT WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE TO CUT THOSE SERVICES IF WE DIDN'T HAVE TO SO I KNOW. THAT NO PROJECTION IS PERFECT WE ALL WE ALL KNOW THAT- BUT I THINK WE ALSO WANT TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO DO ANYTHING- ANY ANY UNNECESSARY CUTS THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO BECAUSE OF THAT. WE UNDERSTAND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER YES THIS IS THE OHIO- QUESTION TO THEM SO WE HAVE. THE ANALYSIS BUT DID THE LA ILL LOOK AT ANY KIND OF THE COOL WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT COST SHIFTING. THE COST IS TO LOSE IT IN. HOSPITALIZATION OR PEOPLE BEING INSTITUTIONALIZED BECAUSE OF THE REDUCTION IN SERVICES WHAT THAT WOULD COST HIM IN. AND IN RESPONSE TO THIS AND THEN ALSO YOU KNOW- ONE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DIDN'T RECOGNIZE WAS SEA BASS. ONE OF THE PROVIDERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA ALREADY- LEAVING THE SYSTEM. AND THIS IS GOING TO BE- TRAVEL AND I BELIEVE THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE ABLE AS ASSERTING IS TALKED ABOUT. LOOKING AT. PROJECTIONS OF BEING ABLE TO HAVE A PLAN B. WHAT IS THE PLAN B. IF THE PROJECTIONS ARE CORRECT OR OF COST SHIFTING WASN'T ACKNOWLEDGED SO. HAS THE LA YOU LOOK AT THE- END RESULTS OF COST SHIFTING IF IS SALUTE INST TO INSTITUTIONALIZING OR HOSPITALIZATION TECH HAS TO TAKE PLACE BECAUSE OF REDUCTIONS OF SERVICES BECAUSE PEOPLE JUST CAN'T AFFORD TO PROVIDE IT BASED ON WHAT IS IN THIS BUDGET. THAT THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT- FOR ALL OF THESE PROPOSALS AT THIS POINT- WE'RE STILL TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE MALL- BUT I THINK THAT YOUR YOUR POINT IS A GOOD ONE AND ONE THAT COMES UP OFTEN IN AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS IS KIND OF. NOT JUST THINKING ABOUT AT THE SAVINGS THE IMMEDIATE SAVINGS BUT MAYBE WHAT WHAT THE POTENTIAL DOWNSTREAM COSTS COULD BE THOSE ARE VERY DIFFICULT ESTIMATES TO MAKE- THEY REQUIRE A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS BUT THERE ARE SOMETHING THAT. WE SHOULD BE MINDFUL OF- AS AS WERE EVALUATING THE BUDGET. THANK YOU AND WITH THAT I SEE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBERS I'M GOING TO BRING IT BACK TO THE CHAIR TO ASK THE FINAL FEW QUESTIONS. BUT DO WANT TO THANK THE FELLOW ASSEMBLYMEMBERS FOR ASKING SUCH DETAILED QUESTIONS. I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE MAIN PURPOSE OF TODAY IS FOR THE PUBLIC TO. ALLOW US TO HEAR FROM THEM. BUT BEFORE WE GET TO THAT I DID WANT TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND YOU MISTER DORSEY IF I COULD. WHICH OF THE PROPOSED CUTS COULD POTENTIALLY DEGRADE OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY RECOVER. FROM THE ECONOMIC RECESSION THAT WE'RE IN. SO YEAH I MEAN I THINK THAT'S. I'VE BEEN IMPORTANT PART OF KIND OF WHAT WE TRIED TO ACCOMPLISH YOUR BY MAINTAINING ELIGIBILITY TO SERVICES SO- BUT THAT THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT THAT I'M WE REALLY NEED ASSISTANCE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- THE STATE IS NOT ABLE. TO WHETHER A RECESSION OF THIS MAGNITUDE WITHOUT THAT KIND OF ASSISTANCE- AND CONTINUED OUR PROGRAMS THE WAY THAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY STRUCTURED- AND SO- THAT IS WHY THAT THE STRUCTURE WAS PUT IN PLACE TO SAY REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS WE WANT TO TRY TO MAINTAIN ELIGIBILITY FOR SERVICES. AND THAT IF WE CAN GET ASSISTANCE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE CAN AVOID THAT THE MAJORITY OF THESE REDUCTIONS AND OF RECOVER MORE QUICKLY AND THAT'S THE GOAL AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ABOUT PLANNING FOR. IF I CAN MISTER DORSEY AND I DO WANT TO HEAR FROM MR ME H. REGARDING- THIS NEXT RESPONSE. BUT HOW DID THE ADMINISTRATION HELP TO ASSESS WHICH OF THESE CUTS. MAY FURTHER PUT PUBLIC HEALTH AT RISK TO OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. WELL I THINK WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS THAT. WE HAVE TRIED TO CONTINUE INVESTMENTS- IN IN CERTAIN KEY AREAS AND- SO FOR EXAMPLE IN OUR- IN OUR USE OF KERR CORONAVIRUS RELIEF FUNDS AND SAY AND SAY I'M SENDING COUNTIES- MONEY THROUGH THAT PROCESS- BUT CERTAINLY THERE WERE A NUMBER OF DECISIONS YOU CAN MAKE WITH THAT WITH A POT OF MONEY LIKE THAT THAT GIVEN. THE PANDEMIC THAT WERE INVOLVED IN A THAT WAS A KEY TO THE BUDGET STRUCTURE- AND AGAIN NOT REDUCING ELIGIBILITY FOR SERVICES I THINK THAT WAS THESE ARE SOME KIND OF T. PLACES WHERE WE TRIED TO MANAGE A VERY VERY DIFFICULT BUDGET ENVIRONMENT WITH- PANDEMIC RESPONSE AND TRYING TO- PRIORITIZE AS BEST WE COULD GIVEN THE DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES AND I'M- HAPPY THAT. ENDED OVER TO MY AGENCY CALLED. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND DOCTOR ARAMBULA I MEAN I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THESE ARE UNBELIEVABLY DIFFICULT DECISIONS AT A TIME WHEN WE ARE ACTIVELY RESPONDING TO A- WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OUR GOAL WAS FIRST AND FOREMOST TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE ABILITY TO HAVE- INCOME AND SO AS YOU WILL SEE THAT IN THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR WE DID NOT CUT GRANTS- WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAD INCOME. IN ORDER FOR THEM WHETHER THIS AND THEN THE SECOND PIECE REALLY TO DOCTOR MISTER DARCY'S COMMENT. IS THAT WE DID NOT WANT TO CUT ELIGIBILITY TO OUR PROGRAMS BUT RATHER WHAT WE FOCUSED ON IS. ELIMINATING THOSE PARTICULAR- INITIATIVES OR EFFORTS THAT WE HAD PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OR THOSE ITEMS THAT WE ARE AT PASSED IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACT THAT WERE EITHER NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED OR WORK TO BE BE IMPLEMENTED. WE REDUCED OUR STUFF ALWAYS HERE TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO NEED IT CASH ASSISTANCE WERE ABLE TO GET CASH ASSISTANCE AND THAT'S WHERE WE FOCUSED OUR ENERGY IN TERMS OF THIS MAY REVISION. IF I CAN MR ME TONIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE PUBLIC REGARDING PROPOSALS. BUT I DID WANNA WAY AND MYSELF AS THE CHAIR TO SOME OF THE PROPOSALS THAT WERE IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET THAT DID GET TAKEN OUT. THAT I DO THINK WE'LL HAVE DRAMATIC EFFECTS. THE FAMILY URGENT RESPONSE SYSTEM IS CRITICAL FOR MANY OF OUR FAMILIES WHO. ARE SEEKING SERVICES THAT TWENTY FOUR HOUR HOTLINE WILL BE NECESSARY AND WAS QUITE IMPORTANT FOR MANY OF US TO BE ADVOCATING FOR LAST YEAR. IN ADDITION THE CAL WORKS HOME VISITING PROGRAM THAT- IS SLATED TO BE CAUGHT IS. CURRENTLY BEING RETROFITTED I UNDERSTAND. TO ALLOW FOR TELEVISION FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS SERVICES. AND WHAT I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT IS THAT OUR CAL WORKS OF FAMILIES OFTENTIMES. OUR THE FAMILIES. TO REALLY HELP US TO AVOID TWO GENERATIONS OF POVERTY. AND REALLY DO BELIEVE THOSE ARE THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE CAPTURE CYCLICAL. SO I STARTED MY QUESTION IF I COULD REALLY TAKING MISTER DORSEY WHICH- OF THE- IN OUR ABILITY. DONALD TRUMP JOB OF HELPING US TO KEEP OUR RATES SENSE TO ALLOW OTHERS TO PARTICIPATE. MY CONCERN. IS JUST WITH OUR MOST VULNERABLE. AND I'VE HEARD IT SAID CLEARLY FROM THIS GOVERNOR AND THIS ADMINISTRATION. THAT WE ARE A GOLDEN STATE FOR YOUR GOLDEN YEARS. AND HAVE CONCERNS THAT THIS BUDGET AFFECTS OUR MOST VULNERABLE. AND WHETHER OR NOT IT'S THE SEA BASS OR MS S. P. OR THE CUTS TO THE AGE TO ELDERLY AND DISABLED I HAVE CONCERNS. THAT OUR ELDERLY ARE GOING TO BE EXPOSED TO GREATER RISK DURING THIS PANDEMIC AT A TIME WHEN THEY NEED US THE MOST. AND SO JUST WANT TO LEAVE WITH. YOU A QUESTION WHICH IS HOW DO WE FEEL FILL. THE GAPS WITHIN SERVICES IF WE ARE GOING TO. LISTEN TO THE PROPOSED CUTS THAT YOU HAVE HOW DO WE MEET THE NEEDS OF. OUR ELDERS. TUCKER ARAMBULA- YOU KNOW WE AS AN ADMINISTRATION HAVE OBVIOUSLY MADE SIGNIFICANT STRIDES WITH REGARDS TO- LOOKING AT THE MOST VULNERABLE INCLUDING THOSE WHO OLDER INDIVIDUALS WE HAD A CHOICE AND NOT CHOICE WAS NOT TO KICK OLDER PEOPLE OFF OF MEDICAID. BUT RATHER KEEP PEOPLE ON MEDICAID AND PERHAPS- LOOK AT THE OPTIONAL SERVICES THAT ARE PART OF MEDICAID IN ORDER FOR US TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAD HEALTH INSURANCE- SO OUR GOAL HERE WAS DIFFICULT ARE ARE ARE CHALLENGE HERE WAS UNBELIEVABLY DIFFICULT AND NO ONE. IS UNDERMINING THAT OR AYE DEBATING THAT WE HAVE SIMILAR-CONCERNS AS YOU DO THE BUDGET THAT WE HAVE PROPOSED IN GENERAL WAS VERY DIFFERENT AT THE SAME TIME. WE YEAH ANIME OF HOW TO MAKE. OF THIS THIS A PROPOSED THAT WE LOVE DOING WITH WHEN THE REST OF THE SITE YOUR AS WELL AS STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS THE STATE ON AND THIS GETTING A- BETTER HOPEFUL YOU CAN FURTHERING. THE IN OF THESE ARE PROPOSALS BUT WE TRY TO BE FOR METHOD AROUND OUR THINKING WITH SOME OF THESE AND WE HAD A CHOICE WE COULD EITHER COMPLETELY TELL SENIORS THAT THEY ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID THE MOST VULNERABLE OF MOTORABLE OR WE COULD SAY WE WILL KEEP YOU ON MEDICAID BUT CERTAIN SERVICES THAT WE MAY NOT BE PROVIDED AND THAT'S- GEN. I WILL HAVE ONE FINAL QUESTION AND THEN I'M HAPPY FOR US TO TURN IT INTO A PUBLIC COMMENT AND I APOLOGIZE FOR. GETTING A BIT WONKY AND ACTUALLY WANTING TO ASK A REAL QUESTION THAT I THINK WILL BENEFIT MY COMMUNITY. BUT THERE WAS AN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WAS MADE BY THE GOVERNOR REGARDING SENIOR MEALS FOR. PEOPLE ELDERS. AND SADLY. NONE OF THE COUNTIES IN THE ENTIRE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY EIGHT COUNTIES WILL BE IMPLEMENTING THIS PROGRAM DUE TO THE WAY IN WHICH WE DESIGN THE PROGRAM. IN AND SAYING THAT WE HAD MATCHING FUNDS IN ADVANCE. AND WHY THAT BECOMES PROBLEMATIC IS POOR COUNTIES LIKE MINE HAVE SENIORS WHO ARE HUNGRY TO. AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHEN WE'RE DESIGNING THESE PROGRAMS HOW WAR HELPING ALL REGIONS IN ALL PARTS OF OUR STATE AND SO. JUST WANTED TO ADD MY ADVOCACY TO THIS THAT I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE. TO HAVE A SEAT AT THIS TABLE AND WANTED TO BE ABLE TO ADD MY VOICE TO THAT DISCUSSION. WITH THAT- HI WILL CONCLUDE OUR QUESTIONS HERE ON THIS PANEL. AND WOULD LIKE TO NOW OPEN IT UP TO PUBLIC COMMENT. I WANT TO FIRST START BY THANKING OUR PANELISTS FOR PARTICIPATING. IN TODAY'S HEARING. WE COVERED A LOT IN A SHORT PERIOD TRYING TO MAKE BEST USE OF OUR TIME. AS WE DO NAVIGATE A REVISION. AND AS I MENTIONED AT THE OUTSET OF THIS HEARING WE WILL BE USING A MODERATED TELEPHONE SERVICE FOR PUBLIC ON. OUR COLIN NUMBER TODAY IS ONE EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN SIX NINE TWO. EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN AND THE ACCESS CODE IS TWO EIGHT THREE FOUR THREE EIGHT. AGAIN PLEASE ONLY TYPE ONE ZERO ONCE. RE ENTERING THOSE TWO DIGITS WILL TAKE YOU OUT OF Q. SO PLEASE AVOID DOING THAT. AT SOME POINT AN OPERATOR WILL COME ON TO THE LINE AND ASK YOU PRIVATELY FOR YOUR NAME FIRST. SO PLEASE BE PREPARED WHEN YOU SPEAK WITH THE OPERATOR AS THIS WILL FACILITATE WHEN YOU'RE TAPPED TO SPEAK TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE. I WOULD LIKE FOR YOU ALL TO PLEASE KEEP YOUR COMMENTS BRIEF IN ORDER TO HAVE US. TO OPEN UP NINETY FROM EVERYONE WOULD. SOMEONE WHO IS HERE- AT THE STATE CAPITOL I WOULD LIKE TO START BY HAVING THEM. HAVE THEIR PUBLIC COMMENT FIRST.

IN YEARS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND THEIR HOME RATHER D. VAN BE PLACED AT THE HOSPITAL THE NURSING HOMES WHERE THE RATE OF DEATH AS YOU WERE IN LITTLE FROM THE COLD IS SO EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH.

PROPOSALS FOR REDUCTIONS ARE GOING TO BE BORNE BY WORKING FAMILIES POOR PEOPLE CHILDREN ARE MOST VULNERABLE THERE IS NOT A FAIR DISTRIBUTION OF PAIN IN THIS MAY REVISION WITH YOUR NOT THE PROPOSAL.

THE BANKS IS SPECIALLY IN TERMS OF BEING- CHARGE FOR ALL THE MALL BANK OF BUSINESS LOANS THAT WERE- PROCURE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THERE IS A LOT OF WELL. BEING GENERATED FROM THIS PANDEMIC AND NONE OF IT IS BEING TAPPED. TO ACCOUNT FOR THE LOSS OF REVENUE AND THEREFORE WHAT IS HAPPENING IS BEING NEGATIVE IMPACT IS BEING BORN.

ARE COUNTING FOR AT LEAST 40% OF THE DATA IN THE ENTIRE STATE. AND I DON'T THINK THE BUDGET SHOULD. BE BORN ON THE BACK OF OUR OLDER ADULTS AND PUTTING THEIR HEALTH AND WELL BEING AT RISK AND SO WE ARE URGING YOU TO REJECT CUTS WERE. YOU TO IS IT'S REYES RENDON REVENUE FIND THE CUT SOMEWHERE ELSE BUT DO NOT MAKE THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION TO KOBE ALSO THE POPULATION THAT. IS GOING TO SUFFER THE MOST. CUT THANK YOU MA'AM.

GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE SO CALLED LONDON ON BEHALF OF THE ALLIANCE SUPPORTING PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES DON'T START BY THINKING MANY OF YOU WHO TOOK THE TIME TO SIGN UP TO BE A PART OF OUR WORK WITH ME FOR A DATE THAT WAS PUT ASIDE BECAUSE OF THE NINETEEN. CRISIS WILL TRY TO THAT UP A WITH PEOPLE I SEE WHAT. ACTUALLY HAPPENS IN PEOPLE'S LIVES EVERY DAY. I DON'T THINK MISTER FREEZE YOUR MISTER MATHIS KICKER FOR. HIS IT CONCERNS THAT HAVE ABOUT. THIS ME REVISED PROPOSAL THESE ARE PRETTY DEVASTATING CUTS AS YOUR SAID MANY OF THE SYSTEM THAT'S ALREADY FOUND TO BE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION BEHIND TO COME IN WITH ANOTHER THREE HUNDRED MILLION ON TOP OF THAT IS PRETTY TRICKY. A COUPLE OF THINGS I'D LIKE TO RAISE WILL PUT OTHER THINGS IN OF IN WRITTEN FORM BUT THANKS FOR YOU TO CONSIDER- THE DIRECTOR TALKED ABOUT HAVING JUST GO TO THE TASK FORCE FOR DISCUSSION- I WOULDN'T. TO WATER ACCESS TO ALL VOICES IN THIS PROCESS SO THAT- COULD NOT JUST LIMITED TO THE SAME VOICE HEARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN- SEKALI ONE ECHO THE COMMENTS ABOUT RATIO FLEXIBILITY WE REALIZE THAT WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE ON CUTS THIS YEAR BUT GIVING THE SYSTEM SOME FLEXIBILITY ON A TEMPORARY BASIS AND HOW IT MEET THE DEMANDS MIGHT ACTUALLY DO EXACTLY WHAT HE COULD COME. IN THE- IN OFFICIAL WAY TO ALL OF US WHERE WE SIT IN THE SYSTEM TODAY WERE HAVING TROUBLE FINDING PEOPLE ACTUALLY COME WORK IN THE SYSTEM. TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW PROGRAMS TO FLOAT LIGHTLY ON A VERY TEMPORARY BASIS. IN THE SIZE OF THE NUMBERS OF PEOPE THEY CAN HANDLE A ONE TIME MIGHT. BE A VERY GOOD MOVE- ALSO I THINK- I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK VERY SERIOUSLY. AT THE PROSPECT OF ASKING FOR SOME KIND OF TEMPORARY AGAIN TEMPORARY WORK FOR. SOMEBODY EACH CBS REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE BEING ROLLED OUT BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. EVERY ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE CONVENIENT EACH CBS GUIDELINES THAT ARE COMING DOWN. WHY MORE COPLEY PROGRAMS IN THE SERVICE. WHILE WE'RE IN THIS CRISIS IF THE STATE COULD GET THE TEMPORARY WAIVER FROM SOME OF THOSE REQUIREMENTS WELL IT'S NOT PREFERRED. IT WOULD ALLOW US THE BETTER WAY TO HANDLE SOME OF THE COST NEEDS. OF THE POPULATION WERE SERVING AND JUST COMPLETELY LOSE PROGRAMS. LASTLY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S SCHEME TO YOU A COUPLE YEARS BACK. WITH A- BIRD THAT DESCRIBE. SAVINGS THE BILL WILL RESULT IN THE SYSTEM FROM THE CLOSURE OF THE REMAINING TWO DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS IN THE SYSTEM. MY UNDERSTANDING NOW IS THE POPULATIONS ARE IN FACT OUT OF THOSE TWO. FACILITIES FAIRVIEW IN COSTA MESA AND THE CINNAMON DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER. AND WE BELIEVE IT'S TIME TO LOOK AT AND ACCOUNT FOR SOME OF THE SAVINGS. THAT SHOULD BE RESULTING ANNUALLY AD INFINITUM FROM THAT IF THERE'S A WAY TO SCORE SOME OF THOSE SAVINGS THIS YEAR INTO THE SYSTEM.

THE FACT WILL REDUCE OF AND ACCELERATE THE PROGRESSION OF DEMENTIA FOR MANY PEOPLE WE OFFER THE ASSEMBLY REJECTED CUTS AND NOT SACRIFICE THE LIVES OF OLDER CALIFORNIANS TO BALANCE THE BUDGET. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WE WILL ALIGN ONE THIRTY SIX. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M GREG WILSON EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CHILD FOR DIRECTIONS SO SHE SHOULDN'T WE GREATLY APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THIS CHALLENGING TIME. WE ARE ALSO VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROPOSED CUTS TO LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT FUNDING THE ECONOMIC AND ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC ARE TRANSLATINGINTO HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT AND EXPECTED INCREASES TO SAFETY THAT CASELOADS SOME OF WHICH ARE REFERRED TO CHILD SUPPORT PRIOR PRIOR YEAR LOCAL CHILD FOR FUNDING WAS ALREADY INADEQUATE FUNDING CUTS NOW WILL TRANSLATE TO MANY ELVIA THERE. NOT BEING ABLE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE CURRENT CASE. MUCH LESS ANY INFLICT OF ADDITIONAL CASES. AS ONE EXAMPLE THE CAPACITY OF LTO SAVES TO ASSIST WITH REVIEWS AN ADJUSTMENT FOR NEWLY UNEMPLOYED PARENTS. WILL BE NEGATIVELY AND SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED. CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS ARE A CRITICAL PART OF EFFORTS TO FIGHT POVERTY AND PROMOTE FAMILY SELF SUFFICIENCY NOW MORE THAN EVER THEY ARE CRUCIAL TO FAMILY SURVIVING THIS ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. WE WOULD URGE LOCAL TIED FOR FUNDING THE RESTORED TO THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY LEVELS I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE COMMENT. THANK YOU SIR. YEAH LINE EIGHTY SEVEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI THIS IS DOCTOR BACK A LITTLE AFTER TEN AM ON POVERTY CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES JESSICA. GREAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I AM I WILL BE REFINED TO A COUPLE OF THE ISSUES AND MY COLLEAGUE MIKE CARROLL WILL BE AT REPLYING TO SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES RAIN AND TODAY'S HEARING. FIRST I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE COLOR HOLDEN PROGRAM AND YOU KNOW WE WORK CLOSELY WITH YOU MISTER CHAIR- TO HELP ESTABLISH IT'S REALLY ESSENTIAL PROGRAMS. THAT HELP. CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. ACHIEVE THE BEST THEY CAN PREVENT THE HARM OF TRAUMA INCLUDING. HOLOCAUST BACK HUNGER AND- POVERTY AND AS YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THE HUNGER NUMBERS. ARE CURRENTLY FOR SINGLE PARENTS IS UP TO FORTY PERCENT. IN THE HOUSEHOLD FOR THE ADULTS- SO WE KNOW THAT THE FAMILIES ARE EXPERIENCING A GREAT DEAL OF STRESS AND THAT HOME VISITING. IT IS COME AT IT IT'S BUILT TO HELP THEM THROUGH THE EXTRA. AND AS YOU MENTIONED IN THE HEARING PREVIOUSLY- AND HAS BEEN DETAILED BY PRIOR TESTIMONY. THESE PROGRAMS ARE ADJUSTING TO THE STATE HOME ORDERS AND PROVIDING ASSISTANCE TO THE TELEPHONE AND INTERNET. COMMUNICATION AND INCLUDING HOW THE FAMILY TO GET CONNECTED TO GO SERVICES- UNTIL WE JUST WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THESE ARE IMPORTANT PROGRAM WE'RE GRATEFUL THE CURRENT PROGRAM WASN'T THERE ARE NOW AND HELP THAT. AND THEY CAN BE ADVOCATE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AS A TOOL TO PREVENT HARM. TO CHILDREN DURING THIS TIME. TO ADDRESS THE CHILD SERVICES AND A PATH THROUGH BEING REMOVE AS A POTENTIAL SOLUTION TO POVERTY. AGAIN WE WERE GRATEFUL TO FEED THE PROPOSAL THAT CALIFORNIA JOIN THE MULTIPLE OTHER STATES THAT PASSED THROUGH THE MAXIMUM ALLOWED AMOUNT ALLOWED. ONE HUNDRED FOR OUR FIRST CHILD TWO HUNDRED FOR THE SECOND OR MORE CHILDREN IN THE CHILD SUPPORT PASSED- TOOK OUR FAMILY- ARE THE AMOUNT WE CURRENTLY. PASSED THROUGH THE FAMILY THAT YOU KNOW IT'S FIFTY DOLLARS THAT'S REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THE NON CUSTODIAL. PARENT HAS PAID FIFTY DOLLARS A HUNDRED DOLLARS TWO HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED- THE GOVERNMENT RETAINS ALL BUT THE FIFTY DOLLARS. I AM IN THE CURRENT CONTEXT THE AMOUNT OF THE CALL THE DOLLAR THAT. THAT ARE BEING GIVEN THROUGH TAX IN US DOES CALL THE AMBULANCE DOLLARS ARE BEING RETAINED- IN WHEN A PARENT. IS ON CAL WORK AND THOSE FAMILIES ARE GETTING SIMPLY THE FIFTY DOLLAR PASSED THROUGH SO- IN THIS SITUATION ABOUT WITH REGARD TO THE TALK. YOU AND THE FUNDING FOR THE CAT THE POOR AGENCIES ONE THING WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN IS THAT IN AN ACCOUNTING OF HOW MUCH OF THE TAX DOLLARS- THAT WERE INTERCEPTED. AND GIVEN TO THE STATE COUNTY AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THOSE NUMBERS AS WELL AND REQUEST THAT THAT BE PART OF THIS LIKE A CONVERSATION LOOK REGARD TO ELIMINATING. WE HAD MADE A COMMENT WITH REGARD TO A PANDEMIC RELATED PROGRAM CHANGES. IN A LETTER THAT WE SUBMITTED OER THE WEEKEND TO- COMMITTEE STAFF AND TO THE GOVERNOR AND IN THEIR WE IDENTIFIED THAT THE ELIMINATION OF THE WE'D LIKE TO SEE AN ELIMINATION OF OVERPAYMENT AND OVER INSURANCE. COLLECTION DURING THE PANDEMIC- AND THERE IS A GREAT A GREAT DEAL OF PROGRAM MOVEMENT RIGHT NOW BOTH PEOPLE APPLYING THE WAY THEY APPLY THE WAY PUT CASES ARE PROCESS. WHETHER OR NOT A REPORT IS NEEDED OR DELAYED- AT AT I CAN'T REMEMBER IN OVER TWENTY YEARS FOR THE ANTI- POVERTY ORGANIZING. SO MUCH CHANGE AND HOW. ARE WORKING AND RICK AND- WITH THE CASE WORKERS AND THE CLIENT. ABOUT APPLICANTS AND RECIPIENTS AND WE KNOW THAT THIS IS IT ADULT SO MANY OF THE CHANGES ARE VERY GOOD THEY'RE ALSO- CHANGES HAPPENING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND WHAT COUNTS AS- INCOME AND WHAT DOES IT- AND THIS CONFUSION WE BELIEVE WILL LEAD TO- A HIGH NUMBER OF OVERPAYMENT AND OVER A SHE WENT TO. IN THE COW OR CAN CALPERS PROGRAM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS ASKED FOR SOME RELIEF FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITH REGARD OVER IF. THERE'S AN ACCOUNT PRESS PROGRAM- SO WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED- APPROVAL FOR THAT RELEASE. WE WOULD LIKE THERE TO BE A CONVERSATION AND THE BUDGET CONTACT ABOUT HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TENDON IF WE DON'T END UP WITH A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE- GOING OVER INSURANCE IS. NEVER PAYMENT I'M KIND. SOMETIMES DUE TO A- THAT'S A GOOD NATURE. ERROR ON THE CLIENTS OR OUTLOOK. BEHALF OR THE CASE. I AND SO LIKE TO ENSURE THAT INTO THE CONVERSATION. WITH REGARD TO THE CALPERS PROGRAM. WE AND BY THE WAY AS I MOVE AWAY FROM THE CAO WORKS PROGRAM JUST TO KNOW THAT MY COLLEAGUE IS GOING TO HIGHLIGHT- OUR GRATITUDE TO- YOU KNOW TO THE ADMINISTRATION FOR REINFORCING THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT THEY CAO WORKS GRANTS AND THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO STAY THE COURSE TO REDUCE AND IN FACT AND THE CHILD COULD BE POVERTY- BY NOT REDUCE IN A GRAND INTO THEIR BUDGET. MOVING ON TO NUTRITION- MY COLLEAGUE MIKE IT'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT CAN BE AND THAT THE SSI- HOUSEHOLDS AND THEIR NUTRITION BENEFITS. WELL THERE WAS A PROPOSAL- AS WE SAW INCOME PROPOSED TRAILER BILL TWO ACROSS. A REDUCTION IN THE CALTRANS. OR PUSHING OUT THE TIMELINE TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO CALPERS RESTAURANT NO PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM IS A PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES- ACCESS TO A PREPARED MEALS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ELDERLY DISABLED OR HOMELAND. IT ONLY DOES SO HOWEVER IN ABOUT ELEVEN COUNTY ACROSS THE STATE AND RECENT LEGISLATION HAS BEEN PASSED AUTHORED BY DR- ASSEMBLY MEMBER DR SHIRLEY WEBER. AND SUPPORTED BY PARTISAN LEE AND UNANIMOUSLY IN THE SENATE ASSEMBLY- TO EXPAND. THIS PROGRAM ACROSS THE STATE. TO BETTER SERVE PEOPLE- WITH SAFE FOOD AN ADEQUATE WAY AND- THANKS SO SEAT WORK THINGS HEALTH SAVINGS BANK PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. TO PUSH OUT THAT TIME LINE AND THIS IS REALLY TOO BAD IT'S AT A TIME WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BOTH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ARE MAKER. ARE LOOKING AT THE REST PROGRAM AS A WAY TO RESPOND EXCERPTED PREPARATION NEEDS DURING THE PANDEMIC. AND ALSO TO BONTA THINK. THE INCREDIBLE LOSS. OF INCOME AND JOBS AMONG RESTAURANT WORKERS- ADD THAT BEING SAID HOWEVER. DEAD COW FRESH TEAM AND THE EBT UNIT OVER AT THE S. S. AND THE OPPOSITE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GRAYSON HAVE BEEN HEROES. THEY'VE GOTTEN MORE THAN. MORE THAN A AND A HALF DOLLARS SO. OF THE- NUTRITION OUT THE DOOR. WHEN YOU TALK TO A POLICY MAY CAN BE EIGHT REFER TO OUR PROGRAM- AS AS A KIND OF LEADERS IN THE FIELD- WE IT THEY FIGURE IF WE CAN DO IT ANYBODY ELSE CAN- ARE NOT EVERYBODY ELSE CAN BUT IF WE CAN'T DO IT AND NOBODY ELSE. SO WE TRY INSIDE IF THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES IS SAYING THAT THEY AT THIS POINT CAN' SPLIT THE FLEX AND MAKE THAT RESTAURANT NO PROGRAMS BE. A STATEWIDE- PROGRAM. WE TRUST THEIR INSTINCTS AND THE VERY DISAPPOINTED- AND HOPEFUL THAT IT'S NOT A FULL YEAR PUSH OUT- WE OUT WE WILL FOLLOW THEIR LEAD AND THEY ARE DOING THEY ARE. THEY ARE MOVING NOW AND- AND THEN FINALLY WITH REGARD TO THE CHARACTER A MAN- WE PUT IN OUR LETTER TO THE NOTE THAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE. AND WE PUT. I HOW. THE POOR CALIFORNIANS MANY TIMES THOSE THAT DON'T HAVE A BANK ACCOUNT THEY HAVEN'T FILED TAXES THEY DON'T RECEIVE BENEFITS THAT WOULD HAVE ENTITLED IN PROGRESS PAYMENT. IN THAT CARE TAX STIMULUS OR FUTURE TAX CANNULA YOU MIGHT WERE ALL IN SUPPORT OF THE HEROES BACK NOT ONLY BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE. ADDITIONAL FISCAL RELIEF FOR LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT PROVIDES ADDITIONAL NUTRITION FUNDING AND DIRECT CASH WITH THE THINK THE PEOPLE. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR YOU PUT SOME EFFORT FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS ELIGIBLE FOR THIS ENTITLED- STIMULUS PAYMENT. RECEIVE IT AND- WITH THAT WILL GO AHEAD AND CLOSE AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE HEARING AND- AND FOR ALL THAT YOU HAVE BEEN AND WILL BE DOING IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR LUCAS FRANK MECCA WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS AT THE ASIAN. WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S ATTEMPTS TO PRESERVE BASIC INCOME ASSISTANCE FOR THE COURTS PEOPLE- FOR EXAMPLE LEAVING CALYX GRANT. OR THEY ARE- WE'RE SINCERELY APPRECIATIVE ABOUT THAT PUT. WE ARE ON THE OTHER HAND EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FATE OF ABUSED AND NEGLECTED CHILDREN AND ADULTS BECAUSE OF THE ALMOST SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR REDUCTION IN REALIGNMENT REVENUES. FOR HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS THAT WERE DISCUSSED BY MY COLLEAGUE SHE- I JUST DIDN'T HEAR IT FROM THE FACT IN THE ABSENT- STATE SUPPORT TO BUTTRESS THE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN REVENUES. WILL BE STEEP REDUCTIONS IN SERVICES TO PROTECT PEOPLE- CHILDREN AND ADULTS ARE BEING AN ABUSED OR NEGLECTED- EXACERBATING THAT PROBLEM AT THE DECISION AND THE NEIGHBOR ADDITION. TO NOT REIMBURSED COUNTY FOR ABOUT EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF COST. FOR THE NEW RESEARCH FAMILY APPROVAL PROCESS. THOSE ARE RESOURCES THAT WE NEED TO GET CARE GIVERS TO ABUSE KIDS. IT'S ALSO MONEY THAT WE ARE CONSTITUTIONALLY ENTITLED TO UNDER PROP THIRTY WE DON'T AGREE WITH THE STATE'S INTERPRETATION. THAT THE RESEARCH FAMILY APPROVAL ACTIVITIES WERE NOT THAT PRE DATED TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN REALIGNED THEY CLEARLY DID NOT. AND SO- WE BELIEVE THAT THOSE FUNDS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE CONSTITUTIONALLY MANDATED TRUE UP BROUGHT THAT UNDER PROPOSITION THIRTY. WITH RESPECT TO ELIGIBILITY- EMPLOYMENT SERVICES AND CAL WORKS CAL FRESH. I JUST THAT. WE UNDERSTAND THAT SOME REDUCTIONS ARE INEVITABLE AND% THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS ACROSS ALL OF THOSE PROGRAMS AND WHAT WE'RE ASKING THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE. IS THIRD CALIBRATE OUR EXPECTATION CALIBRATE ACCOUNTABILITY IN CALIBRATE OUR PERFORMANCE EXPECTATION BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE HAVE. I THINK THE BUDGET ESSENTIALLY SAYS. DO YOUR BEST WE CAN'T. BOND THOSE ACTIVITIES WHERE WE OUGHT TO- WE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL- MAKING WORK AND WE WILL DO OUR BEST BUT WE HAVE TO ALIGN. REASONABLE EXPECTATIONS OF COUNTY PERFORMANCE WITH THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE. I SHOULD SAY THE SAME THING FOR OUR CLIENTS WE HAVE TO LINE- UP A LINE OR EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT WE CAN EXPECT BY WAY OF PARTICIPANTS- PARTICIPATING IN WELFARE TO WORK ACTIVITIES IS ABOUT A SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PLUS REDUCTION AND CAL WORKS EMPLOYMENT SERVICE THAT. WE DO NOT AGREE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION BUT I'M SURE. THAT THOSE FUNDS ARE NECESSARY BECAUSE SOME SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THE NEW COLD WAR COMING ON TO POWER. OUR RECENTLY CONNECTED TO THE LABOR FORCE AND THEREFORE WON'T NEED EMPLOYMENT SERVICES. WE THINK LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE COMING ON TO CAO WORKS ARE GOING TO BE COMING FROM A SERVICE SECTOR. WHERE JOBS ARE GOING TO BE PERMANENTLY LOST NECESSITATING- CLUB RETRAINING FOR DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES. AND SO WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT UP HOLDEN CAUGHT WE'RE JUST SAYING WE KNOW INEVITABLY PEOPLE WILL WILL NOT GET SERVICE THAT THEN UNDER THE LAW. WE PROVIDE PEOPLE GOOD CAUSE FOR NOT PARTICIPATING BUT WE HAVE TO TURN THEIR TIME CAUGHT UP HERE SHOULD NOT BE JEOPARDY TO THE CLIENT- TO HAVE THEIR CAL WORKS. FINE ON AID CHECK YEAH WE JUST BECAUSE OF THIS TERRIBLE RECESSION AND CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY FOR THEIR SERVICES. NOW WE HAVE SUBMITTED- A LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE THAT GOES INTO MUCH MORE DETAIL ABOUT THE TYPES OF- PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS CALIBRATION THAT WE WANT TO DO. AND SIMPLIFICATION BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE EXTENDED FROM THE EXECUTIVE ORDER. FINALLY MISTER CHAIR. WE THINK THERE ARE TWO CUTS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DETERGENT. COUNTERPRODUCTIVE GIVEN OUR DESIRE TO RESTART THE ECONOMY AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN- THE FIRST IS THE ELIMINATION OF SUBSIDIZEDEMPLOYMENT ON THE COUCH FOR CABINET THE VIRTUAL ELIMINATION- WHAT WE LEARNED. IN THE GREAT RECESSION WAS THAT SUBJECT EMPLOYMENT WAS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS THAT WE COULD SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESS SAYS. I'M AND SMALL EMPLOYERS TO HELP SUBSIDIZE THE WAGE OF CLIENTS FOR A TEMPORARY PERIOD OF TIME. TO REDUCE THE COST OF THEM TO ACTUALLY SORT OF RE OPEN THEIR BUSINESS AS WELL AT THE SAME TIME PROVIDING EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR CLIENTS. DATA FROM THE AT THAT INDICATE THAT IT'S A VERY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THERE WERE SEVENTY TWO HUNDRED PARTICIPANTS. THOSE PARTICIPANTS DOUBLE THEIR INCOME THE MEDIAN INCOME DURING THEIR TIME ON HIM- BUT BUT IMPLEMENT. THEM WHAT'S MORE INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT IS THAT AFTER THEY LEFT THE PROGRAM- THE INCREASE IN MEDIAN INCOME WAS MORE THAN TWO AND A HALF TIMES- THEN. HAD THEY NOT PARTICIPATE. WITH ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT IN SUBSIDIZED EMPLOYMENT. BUT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PASSES ON JULY FIRST WE WILL ON EMPLOYEE FOUR THOUSAND CHARACTERS THAT WE URGE YOU TO REJECT THAT CUT. AND FINALLY MISTER CHAIR WE ALIGN ORSELVES WITH YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT THE FAMILY URGENT RESPONSIVE COMMITTED. THE TYPES OF STRESSES THAT THAT SYSTEM IS SO CRITICAL FOR HEALTH CARE GIVERS AND YOU- REMAIN CONNECTED INTO NOT A PLACEMENT DISRUPTION SO THREATENS GO UP AND HAVE GONE UP. AND ANYBODY WITH CHILDREN NOTES ON IN THIS- IN THE KOBE EMERGENCY AND SO WE WOULD URGE THE ADMINISTRATION IN THE LEGISLATURE BY TO KEEP THAT THE MOMENTUM GOING INTO EMPLOYMENT FIRST. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU MISTER AMERICA COM I DO ON A- GIVE AN UPDATE FOR THOSE WHO ARE LISTENING WE HAVE ROUGHLY SIXTY CALLERS- THAT ARE ON HOLD AT THE MOMENT WE DO HAVE A HARD STOP AT SEVEN PM TODAY SO IN THREE HOURS.

MANY AND YOU ALL STOOD UP AND INVESTED IN AMETHYST HE AND RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE WORK. TO PROTECT OUR FRAIL ELDERS THAT KEEPING THEM SAFE AT HOME. A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE AND A LOWER COST TO THE STATE IN KEEPING THEM OUT OF HARM'S WAY WHICH IS OUR BOTH OUR DUTY AND OUR RESPONSIBILITY. TO THEM ESPECIALLY IN A TIME OF COVERT NINETEEN. THIS COMMITTEE HAS STOOD UP FOR THE FRAIL ELDERLY TIME AND TIME AGAIN. WE URGE YOU TO DO SO AGAIN THIS YEAR AND REJECT THE ELIMINATION OF THE MSRP. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THIS IS ON MY CAR WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEES- HEARING AND TAKING ALL THE TESTIMONY GET YOU ARE TODAY- I HAVE SEVERAL COMMENTS YOU'RE MOSTLY RELATED TO CAL WORKS IN A FEW RELATED TO OR- AFTER FIVE- I THINK FIRST OF ALL OVERALL. I MEAN WE REALLY DO. OUR THE APPROACH TAKEN BY THE ADMINISTRATION IN. DEALING WITH THE CRISIS IN THE SHORTFALL I MEAN WE ARE. WE HAVE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT THE GRANT LEVELS THAT WILL OCCUR IN THE TOWERS WILL GRAHAM GOING FORWARD GIVEN DAHLE- HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS AND WE ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF- WHAT MINISTRATION CHOSE TO. MAINTAIN THOSE GROUND LEVEL AND TO TAKE STEPS TO- MAKE SURE THERE WAS GOING TO BE ADEQUATE FUNDING IN THE BUDGET TO ABSORB THE CASELOAD INCREASES THAT WERE ALREADY SEEN THAT WE ANTICIPATE GOING COURT- THE- WE ARE CONCERNED THOUGH IT AND AS MISTER MAC- JUST MENTION A FEW MOMENTS AGO. ABOUT THE IMPACT THE TIME LIMITS MAY HAVE ON FAMILIES AS- MANY OF YOU KNOW- WE HAVE. WE HAVE REDUCED OUR TIME LIMITS AND IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE AND- MANY FAMILIES ALREADY HAD SPENT TIME BACK IN THE GREAT RECESSION ON TOP ON EIGHT. MAY HAVE SPENT TIME IN THE LAST TEN OR TWELVE YEARS ON A BEGAN AND NOW. FOR A THIRD TIME PERHAPS ARE FACING ANOTHER- TIME ON CAL WORKS AND THEY HAVE VERY SHORT TIME CLOCK. AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE'VE BEEN URGING THE COMMITTEE TO LOOK THIS YEAR TO CONSIDER SPENDING A TIME CLOCK TO THE FOR MAC ON ONE. SIX MONTHS. ADMIN THOUGH WE DO THINK THAT ANY. FAMILY THAT. PARTICIPATE IN WATFORD. GETTING SO CALLED GOOD CAUSE FOR NON PARTICIPATION SHOULD HAVE THEIR TIME CLOCK STOP FOR ANY MONTH TO. APART GET THERE ON A- PROBLEM RIGHT NOW FAMILY CAN ONLY HAVE THEM STOP IN THE FIRST TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. AND THERE ARE MANY FAMILIES NOW THAT ARE GOING TO BE BEYOND THE TWENTY FORMA CLEMENT. AND CANNOT GO TO WORK AND YET WILL NOT HAVE THE TIME CLOCK STOPPED AND WE THINK. THAT THAT OUGHT TO BE DEALT WITH IN TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THIS YEAR- THE ONLY MENTION MUCH. SEVERAL HOURS AGO NOW THE LOOKING AT THE FLEXIBILITY THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. IN THE CODE WORD CRISIS AND WE ARE VERY CREATION OF A FAST FOR. A BOOK THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN PDF THAT THAN THAT IN THIS MATTER BUT WE DO AGREE THAT THERE ARE THINGS THAT I DIDN'T FEEL THAT. PERHAPS WE DON'T NEED DOING ON ALL BASICALLY COULD ACTUALLY BE STRIP MINED. MADE FOR CHEN GET PEOPLE THERE. THEIR BENEFITS QUICKER AND REDUCING THE BURDENS ON COUNTY WORKERS. I WE TO ACTUALLY SUBMITTED A PROPOSAL TO THE LEGISLATURE. THAT WILL DO THAT IN PARTICULAR ONE THING THAT WE WOULD KNOW IS THAT. WE HEARD. TWO TO ADOPT MANY OF THE STREAM WHAT PROPOSAL SENATE BEEN- PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. THAT HAPPENED- PART OF OUR ONGOING. NUMBER EFFORT THAT IN THE FUTURE. IF WE HAVEN'T QUITE LIKE THIS WE WON'T TO. A NUMBER OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND EIGHTY ALL THIS. THOSE ISSUES CAN BE DEALT WITH AUTOMATICALLY HAVING HIM- IN MILWAUKEE IN ADVANCE- WE ARE HAPPY TO ADMINISTRATION DID NOT DO ANYTHING IN THE BUDGET. RECUSE IN YOUR HOURS. PROGRAMS HE ALSO. PROGRAM AND OTHER ENDEAVORS WE THINK IT'S GOING TO BE ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL THAT WE DO THAT BUT WE DO THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME FLEXIBILITY THANK BE. AND ALMOST SINCE PROGRAM. EXAMPLE RID OF THE RIVER. THAT WE WON'T PAY RENT THAT HE- THAT IS INCREASE OF AN ACCESS TO THE PERCENT OF SOMONE INCOME. THAT IN BUT BEING A BARRIER FOR MANY FAMILY. WE THINK OF TâM TO GET MORE THAN ONE BILLS SIX DAYS ATTEMPT SISTER. ALLOWING THEM MORE THAN ONE DURING THE CRISIS WOULD BE. SOMETHING WITHOUT A CA. DOING WE GOING TO HAVE A MAJOR NUMBER OF A MASSIVE NUMBER OF AFFECTION. BEING PROPOSED BY LANDLORDS TH COMING MONTHS AND WE NEED TO HAVE ALL THE RESOURCES AND TOOLS ARE. WHAT WE CAN. MANAGED FROM. AND THE LASTLY ON AFTER OUR PARDON ME MONEY SAY THAT WE ALSO- WANT TO- JOIN YOU MISTER MAC OF COMMENTS ABOUT THE SINGLE ALLOCATION AND THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE ABOUT EMPLOYMENT SERVICES BOB AND THE WIDELY ON AT THE SITE- YOU KNOW WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROPOSED CUT AND WHILE I KNOW. GIVEN SOME OF THE OTHER CUTS THAT WE'VE HEARD DISCUSSED TODAY THEY MAY NOT SEEN AT THE MAGNITUDE OF THAT- I WOULD JUST REMIND THAT WE ARE ON NOW IN YOUR LAP AND OF OVERLY AROUND TO CUT THEM DURING THE GREAT RECESSION WHICH GRANTS WERE CUT BY SEVENTY SEVEN DOLLARS A MONTH FOR EVERY RECIPIENT HAVE NEVERBEEN RESTORED AND IS SO THIS CUT ON TOP OF THAT JUST SEEMS. A LITTLE BIT GRATUITOUS AND WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO REJECT ADDITIONALLY- WE HAVE ASKED FOR- PARITY FOR THE TRANSITIONAL. KITCHEN HOW. AND ONLY. RUSSIAN BENEFIT WHICH IS TO AT THE FIVE RECIPIENT TO HOUSEHOLDS WHERE THEY A WALK INCOME DUE TO THE INDIAN OF CASH OUT- MANY HOUSEHOLD GOT A BUMP IN THEIR SNAP BENEFIT NGUYEN FROM CONGRESS IN THE CARES ACT- KIßM BE RECIPIENTS DID NOT GET THAT THE ADMINISTRATION ALREADY PROVIDED A- ARE COMPLEMENTARY INCREASE AND BENEFITS FOR A- CALIFORNIA FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAM RECIPIENTS- BUT WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED ONE FOR THE TRANSITION A CHRISTIAN BENEFIT PROGRAMS WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO. TO BRING PARITY DID THAT AND PROVIDE A STATE LEVEL BENEFIT- FOR THOSE FAMILIES- AND THEN THE FINAL THING IS WE WOULD JUST CONCUR WITH MISS BURKE EARLIER COMMENT ABOUT THE BIGGER AND ABOUT TAKING POST LOOK ABOUT BOTH THE TIME OF WHEN THE TRIGGER WOULD GOING TO AFFECT AND HOW ACT WE WILL OPERATE ON WHETHER OR NOT ALL THE CUTS WOULD GO INTO EFFECT IF WE COME UP A LITTLE SHORT SEVERAL MINE.

I WANT TO EMPHASIZE TWO THINGS FOR TODAY ONE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE TIME THAT YOUR ALLOWING EVERYBODY TO SPEAK AND TO SPEAK FROM THE HEART WE KNOW HOW DIFFICULT THIS IS TO IMPLEMENT PLEASE CUT. I WANT TO FIRST POINT OUT THAT A 100% OF THE YOUTH. THAT ARE IN THE SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL. PROGRAMS FORMALLY KNOWN AS FOSTER CARE. ARE ONLY WITH A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND THEY ARE THE MOST. CHALLENGING YEAR AND THEY ALL. IN THESE PROGRAMS ARE THAT THEY ARE NOT IN JUVENILE DETENTION CENTERS AND I'M NOT ON THE STREET. AND THEN THE SECOND TAKE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF CARE AND THE OFTEN THE LAST PLACEMENT OPTION BEFORE THE IS HOSPITALIZED. AND THEY ARE. IT'S CRITICAL TO NOT UNDERSTAND THEM RIGHT NOW. WHEN THE COST OR EVEN HIGHER TO MAKE SURE WE'RE TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS CRITICAL YOU. I ALSO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE 5% RATE CUT FOR THIS PROGRAM WHICH IS CALLED AFTER DEEPLY DOES VIOLATE LAW AS DECIDED IN A LAWSUIT ALLIANCE FORCES WAGNER AND ROSE AND WE WILL BE BRINGING THAT UP TO THE STATE. BUT I DID WANT TO MENTION THAT THAT WAS A LAWSUIT THAT WAS EDUCATED IN A CALL THE COURT. AND WE DO NOT THINK THAT THE ACTION IS LEGAL. THEN I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE FOX FAMILY AGENCY SOCIAL WORKER. 90% IDENTIFIES SEEN ON THE LOWEST PAID OF MASTER LEVEL SOCIAL WORKERS. A THIRD ONE THIRD F ALL FOSTER KIDS IN HOMES.

WOULD ONE SOCIAL WORKER YOU HAVE A 75% TO NOT ACCEPT A COMMON FATE A TOP 18% WHEN YOU HAVE TO REMARKS. I THINK WHAT'S REALLY MOST IMPORTANT AS WE RECOGNIZE THAT THESE CUTS ARE DRACONIAN THAT A FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR. BUDGET DEFICIT MUST BE FELT AND THE PAIN IS REAL. AND IF THE BEARD. HOWEVER FOR THE PROCESSING AGENCY SOCIAL WORKERS WE HAVE PARTICIPATED IN A STUDY THAT TOOK TEN YEARS TO GET OFF THE GROUND. IT IS GOING TO BRING IN FEDERAL FUNDING IT'S BEING IMPLEMENTED. POSSIBLY IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS JEFF TO PROVE FROM THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION OF CHILDREN AND FAMILY. IT WILL PAY FOR THE CUT. THAT'D BE PROPOSED THIS ONE TIME CUT ONE TIME COLA. THAT WAS JUST A NOT. BARELY ENOUGH TO KEEP. THE FATHER CAME AGENCY SOCIAL WORKERS. 90% FEMALE 100% OF THE CONTENT OF SOME OF THE TALK TO CARE. SO. THE PROPOSAL IS REALLY. AND I'M THE MEDIC BECAUSE IT A RED TO STAFF AND WE- TO ALLOW THE COST OF LIVING COULD NOT BE CUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR WHICH IS REALLY DEVASTATING. TO LET IT GO TO THE END OF THE YEAR AND WE ARE GAMBLING AND BETTING. THAT THE NEW FUND COMING UP IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL BACK SELECT AND THEN IF IT DOESN'T COME IN YOU CAN ELIMINATE THAT AND THAT I SHOULD POINT OUT WE ARE UNDER THE TRIGGER SO HOPEFULLY THAT WILL COVER IT BUT IF IT DOESN'T COVER IT. WE'LL FIND THE FUNDS FOR THAT. SO JUST REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT. FOR THE FOSTER YEARS. EITHER SOCIAL WORKER. AND FOR THE KIDS AFTER KEEPING THAT THERAPEUTIC PLACEMENT SO THAT THEY ARE NOT.

I HAVE HAD IN THE RESPONDING TO THE KOBE AND HEALTH CARE CRISIS- YOU. OUR COMMUNITY HAS HAD TO REACT VERY QUICKLY AND HAS HAD TO- CHANGE SERVICES FOR THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AND REACT WITH- VERY NIMBLE AND CREATIVE SERVICE DELIVERY AND APPRECIATE THE FISCAL RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. LOOKING AHEAD TO NEXT YEAR I THINK EVERYONE. YOU TROUBLED BY THE- THE PROSPECT OF BE ECONOMIC SITUATION BUT LIFE AND BROUGHT ABOUT AND I WANT TO CALL OUT SPECIFICALLY THE PROPOSED PROVIDER CUT. AND SPECIFICALLY BE THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND WHICH TRANSLATES TO ALMOST HALF A BILLION DOLLARS IN- RATE CUTS AND OTHER EFFICIENCIES THE- PURCHASE OF SERVICE. WE KNOW THAT THIS FIFTEEN HAVE STRUGGLED MIGHTILY WITH UNDER FUNDING FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND ARE CONCERNED THAT THESE TYPES OF CUTS. WILL RESULT IN LESS QUALITY OF LIFE- MORE ABUSE AND NEGLECT THAT GOES UNDETECTED BECAUSE OF MORE PROFESSIONAL YOU HAVEN'T SOMEONE LIKE THE GREATER THE LIKELIHOOD. THAT THIS VULNERABLE POPULATION HAS ADDITIONAL EYES ON THEM- WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF TRANSITIONING TO A NEW NORMAL YOU KNOW OUR OLD NORMAL WAS THERE FOR A VERY LONG TIME. AND THEN WE KIND OF ONE INCH OF THIS PLACE WHERE OF COURSE BECAUSE OF- CONCERNED ABOUT CONGREGATE SETTING AND- WE NEED TO SOCIALLY DISPENSED. FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TOMORROW LOOKS LIKE AND THE DAY AFTER AND THE DAY AFTER THAT AND THEN FINALLY WATER NEAR NORMAL BOOKS LIKE- WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT AS WE- MOVE INTO THAT PHRASE THAT THERE BE- FUNDING MADE AVAILABLE TO. ALLOW THE SYSTEM TO BALANCE BUT HEALTH AND SAFETY OF. PARTICIPANTS IN THE PROGRAM BUT ALSO THE PRESERVATION OF CRITICAL RESOURCES AND THERE IS A DOCUMENT THAT WAS SUBMITTED BY A NUMBER OF SERVICE PROVIDERS. THAT OUTLINED THE REALLY NICE PLAN FOR HOW TO BALANCE THOSE TWO INTEREST. AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT IN THIS TIME ONE OF THE REMARKABLE THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES HAVE HAD MUCH MUCH LOWER RATE THAT OKAY NINETEEN. EXPOSURE DIAGNOSIS AND DEATH THEN WE WOULD HAVE ANTICIPATED GIVEN THE MEDICAL FERTILITY AND VULNERABILITY OF THE POPULATION AND WE OWE THAT TO THE DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS WHO HAVE.

THE HOW MANY A TIME WHEN HE SAID MORE TO THE PROVIDER NETWORK WE DON'T CENTERS WERE ALREADY STRUGGLING UNDER EXISTING MANDATES WE WERE OVER EIGHT HUNDRED SERVICE COORDINATOR SHORT STATEWIDE. AND NOW WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO INCREASE ACCESS TO GENERIC RESOURCES AGAIN TO PROVIDE REALLY ROBUST SERVICES TO PEOPLE AND DOING THAT WHILE AT THE SAME TIME FINDING IF IT SHOULD BE THE FUNDING IS JUST A VERY SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES- AND ONE THAT. MEANS THAT EACH PERSON SERVED IN THE SYSTEM POTENTIALLY COULD HAVE LAST SERVICE COORDINATION EFFORTS AT A TIME WHEN WE'RE EXPECTING- GREATER NEED TO WALK PEOPLE THROUGH GENERIC SERVICES ADDING- ACCESSING THAT WAS AN ESPECIALLY THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM. AS AN ASSOCIATION WE ARE COMMITTED TO MOBILIZING OUR COMMUNITY TO DO YOUR PART CHIU- SERVE AS- TO SECURE IT MUCH FF HE IS POSSIBLE.

NINE TO THIRTY TWO YOUR LINE IS OPEN YOU CAN BE HEARD PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY NAME IS CYNTHIA STOLEN THE FOSTER CARE AND ADOPTION COORDINATOR CHILDREN'S BUREAU. THE CHILDREN'S BUREAU HAS BEEN PROVIDING SERVICES TO CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN YEARS AND I HAVE BEEN WITH CHILDREN TO GROW PERSONALLY FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS. AND I AM PASSIONATE ABOUT THE FOSTER FAMILY AGENCY SYSTEM AND HAVE PRIMARILY WORKED IN IN FOSTER CARE FOR MY ENTIRE PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE AND I'M I'M ENCOURAGING THE COMMITTEE TO PLEASE SUPPORT FOSTER FAMILY AGENCY SOCIAL WORKERS AND TO PLEASE RESTORE THE FUNDING THAT GOVERNOR NEWSOME JUST ELIMINATED IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET. I CARE I PERSONALLY CARE DEEPLY FOR FOSTER CHILDREN AND THE FAMILIES THAT WE SERVE SOCIAL WORKERS ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS AT ALL TIMES COLD OR NO COLD IT VULNERABLE CHILDREN WHO'VE BEEN SEPARATED FROM THEIR BIRTH FAMILIES DUE TO ABUSE NEGLECT TRAUMA AND OTHER ADVERSE LIFE EXPERIENCES. IN MY OPINION THERE IS NO MORE IMPORTANT ROLE THAN BEING A SOCIAL WORKER PROTECTING FOSTER CHILDREN PROVIDING THEM WITH SERVICES AND SUPPORT. TO HEAL AND OVERCOME THE TRAGEDY OF ABUSE AND LOSS OF THEIR BIOLOGICAL FAMILY WE ARE ALSO CHARGED WITH SUPPORTING EFFORTS TO REUNIFY CHILDREN WITH THEIR FAMILIES A RESPONSIBILITY WE TAKE SERIOUSLY. OUR GOAL IS THE SAFETY PERMANENCY AND WELL BEING OF FOSTER CHILDREN. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT SOCIAL WORKER STABILIY IS THE NUMBER ONE INDICATOR OF FOSTER USED TO ACHIEVE PERMANENCY WITH AS HAS BEEN ALREADY SAID BY MY AMAZING COLLEAGUES LAURA RICHARDSON KATY WALTER AND SHE SWORE SOMEBODY FROM SENECA FAMILY OF AGENCIES AND JACQUI ROUGH HOUSE ARE FROM THE ALLIANCE. OF CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES THAT WITH ONE SOCIAL WORKER THERE'S A 75% RATE OF PERMANENCY AND IT DROPPED 18% WHEN THERE ARE TWO MORE SOCIAL WORKERS SERVING FAMILIES. WE ALL HAVE THE SAME GOALS TO HELP OUR FOSTER CHILDREN BUT REDUCING FUNDING TO SOCIAL WORKERS WILL SEVERELY UNDERCUT. THE CHANCE OF PERMANENCY FOR OUR FOSTER YOU. I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO KEEP THE FUNDING IN THE BUDGET BECAUSE I FOSTER CHILDREN DESERVE TO HAVE A PERMANENT FAMILY. IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO TAKE AWAY THE SOCIAL WORKER ONE TIME FUNDING. THAT WE SO DESPERATELY NEEDED LAST YEAR AND NEED TO CONTINUE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING THE TIME TO LISTEN TO OUR COMMON. AND WE DO APPRECIATE THE DIFFICULT DECISIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS TO MAKE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM. LINE THREE SEVENTY NINE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. YEAH YES HI THIS IS MERRY FRAME AND I AM AT- QUALITY ASSURANCE DIRECTOR AND SOCIAL WORKER IN A FOSTER FAMILY AGENCY AND I JUST WANTED TO TAKE. THIS TIME TO THANK YOU GUYS FOR ALL OF YOUR CONSIDERATION I KNOW THESE ARE DIFFICULT DECISION. BUT HE- FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE COLA FOR THE AFTER DAY WORKERS. I FEEL WILL HAVE SUCH A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT IN THE SHORT TERM. ON THE FOSTER CHILDREN ALREADY DEALING WITH SO MUCH. WHETHER IT BE COVERED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY WITH FAMILY OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH THE ARE PEOPLE OF THEIR LIVES. THE SOCIAL WORKER IS SUCH A KEY CONTACT IN SUCH A KEY RELATIONSHIP FOR THEM ANSWER REPORTER RESOURCE PARENTS SUPPORT. THAT REMOVING BAD AND JEOPARDIZING THAT IS DAMAGING THAT FUNDING WILL HAVE NOT ONLY LONG TERM PERMANENTLY EFFECTIVE WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT BUT ALSO SHORT TERM WELL BEING A FAX ON THE- THE FONT USED IN THE VULNERABLE POPULATION WE. ARE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU MA'AM. MOVING NOW TO LINE TO TWENTY EIGHT GO AHEAD PLACE.

AND TO RESTORE THE FUNDING THAT THE GOVERNOR ELIMINATED IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET YOU'VE HEARD FROM MANY FEATURES ABOUT THE STATISTICS OF PERMANENCY FOR FOSTER CHILDREN WITH THE KEY RELATIONSHIP THEY DOUBLE UP WITH ONE SOCIAL WORKER SO I WON'T REPEAT THEM NOW- I WILL SAY THAT WE ARE NORMALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE OUTCOME FOR FOSTER CHILDREN. WITH THE VARIOUS CUTS IN PROGRAMS THAT IMPACTED VERY VULNERABLE POPULATION I KNOW WE ALL HAVE THE SAME GOAL TO HELP OUR FOSTER CHILDREN BUT WE DO THINK FUNDING TO SOCIAL WORKERS WILL SEVERELY UNDERCUT THE CHANCES OF PERMANENCY. FOR OUR FOSTER YOU. SO WE URGE YOU TO RESTORE% THE FUNDING FOR FOSTER FAMILY AGENCY SOCIAL WORKERS AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE APPRECIATE ALL YOUR DURING ALL YOU ARE DOING DURING THIS UNPRECEDENTED TIME. THANK YOU.
