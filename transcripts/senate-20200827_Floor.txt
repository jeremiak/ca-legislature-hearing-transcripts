WE'RE GOING TO START OFF WITH SOME COMMENTS FROM THE PRESIDENT PRO TEM OF THE SENATORS SENATOR ATKINS THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES GOOD AFTERNOON I WANT TO SAY A FEW WORDS AS WE ARE ABOUT TO EMBARK ON THE HOME STRETCH OF THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION. WE'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT SCIENCE AND PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDELINES WOULD BE OUR GOD POSED AS WE NAVIGATE THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS DURING THIS PANDEMIC. SINCE MARCH WE HAVE IT HERE TO THAT COMMITMENT AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO ADHERE TO THOSE PROTOCOLS IN THESE LAST REMAINING DAYS OF SESSION. WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF BILLS TO GET THROUGH AND A CONSTITUTIONAL DEADLINE OF AUGUST THIRTY FIRST. BUT WE ALSO MUST CONTINUE TO FOLLOW CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDELINES AND DIRECTIVES. UNFORTUNATELY THAT MEANS SEVERAL OF OUR COLLEAGUES ARE NOT WITH US TODAY IN PERSON AS THEY FOLLOW THE DIRECTIVE TO QUARANTINE AT HOME. IT ALSO MEANS THE NEW PROCESSES WE BEGAN DEVELOPING THIS SPRING TO PROVIDE SENATORS THE ABILITY TO DEBATE AND VOTE REMOTELY ARE NOW WARRANTED. THE SENATE RULES COMMITTEE HAS ARRANGED FOR A QUARANTINE COLLEAGUES TO DEBATE AND VOTE FROM THEIR SACRAMENTO RESIDENCES AS WE WORK TO CONCLUDE OUR WORK BY MONDAY'S DEADLINE. THEIR VOICES ARE IMPORTANT THEIR COLLABORATION IS KEY AND THEIR CONTINUED ADHERENCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTIVES AND PROTOCOLS IS APPRECIATED. WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK AHEAD OF US OVER THE NEXT FOUR DAYS BUT I AM CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL MEET OUR GOALS. WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO WORK AND LEGISLATORS BY ALL OF THE CHALLENGES. THAT THIS PANDEMIC HAS PRESENTED WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS AS WELL MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU SO MUCH. OFF FOR A CHANCE TO SAY A FEW WORDS. THANK YOU MADAM CLUB PRO TEM PRE SHARE COMMENTS AND I BELIEVE SENATOR NIELSEN ON THIS ISSUE WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS. IF I MAY. MADAM PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED CIRCUMSTANCE. AND I APPRECIATE THE ACCOMMODATION FOR ALLOWING REMOTE VOTING. FOR THOSE MEMBERS WHO CANNOT BE HERE. BUT I WILL SUBMIT. IT THAT I'M AWARE OF IN THE PROCREATION COMMITTEE THERE WHO WOULD BENEFIT CHANGES BETWEEN MEMBERS. AND THE AFFECTED MEMBER. THAT MIGHT NOT A BE REVIEWED AS WELL. AND THERE MAY BE MORE INDIVIDUALS WHO SHOULD BE QUARANTINED FROM PARTICIPATION HERE ON THE FLOOR. MEMBERS OF BOTH PARTIES. I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. AND THE IRONY IS NOT LOST ON THE FACT THAT INTO IN THIS SUMMER. WHEN TWO MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY. TURNED UP WITH THE VIRUS WE SHUT EVERYTHING DOWN BAM. WE WERE LOOKING AT THE HEALTH. AND WILL BE OTHER MEMBERS. SO WHY NOT SHUT IT DOWN NOW. WE GET ALL TESTED I GUESS A THREE O'CLOCK WE'RE ALL GOING TO GET TESTED LET'S GET THE TEST RESULTS. AND WORK OVER THE WEEKEND WHATEVER THE LAST DAY OF TO HAVE THE THIRTY FIRST. TO ACCOMPLISH THAT. I'VE GOT ALL THE DOCUMENTS HERE OF THE FORMER AGREEMENT. THAT CHANGE EQUITABLE. L. A. R. IS NOT LOST IT I'M THE ONLY REPUBLICAN HERE. WHY BECAUSE I DIDN'T GO TO A CAUCUS MEETING AND I DIDN'T GO TO A DINNER. SO I GET TO BE THE VOICE OF. NINE THOUSAND OR NINE MILLION. PEOPLE THAT ARE CALLING MY COLLEAGUES REPRESENT OUR COLLEGE REPRESENT. AND WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT. THE HEALTH. OR A HANDFUL OF BILLS AT THE END OF SESSION MANY OF WHICH ARE AMENDED AT THE LAST MINUTE SO I KNOW SOME BUDGET BILLS ARE GOING TO BE AMENDED AT THE LAST MINUTE. IS THAT DOING THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS NO. BUT THIS CERTAINLY FANS OF POSSIBLE AND SHINED A SPOTLIGHT ON THAT EXCESS THAT WE HAVE NOW EMBRACED FOR DECADES AROUND HERE. NOT SHOWING INTEGRITY OF THE INSTITUTION. OR OF THE PROCESS. SO WHAT IS TO BE TOMORROW THE. I GATHER THAT THEY ALL GET TO. VOTE TOMORROW REMOTELY IS THAT CORRECT PROCAMP. THE ABSENT MEMBERS REPUBLICANS WILL BE ABLE TO VOTE TOMORROW AS WELL AS TODAY SENATOR NELSON WESTERN IRAQ. I UNDERSTAND THIS IS A RATHER UNIQUE DISCUSSION AND I'M SURE THAT THE PRO TEM WILL RESPOND TO ANY OF YOUR COMMENTS SHE IS OKAY YOU ARE DONE JUST JUST THAN THAT LET'S JUST. LEAVE IT AT THAT CALL IT RHETORICAL FOR THE MOMENT IT'S ALL RHETORICAL FOR THE MOMENT. RHETORICAL MY COLLEAGUES BUT IMPASSIONED. YOU KNOW ME WELL ABOUT NINE FOOT STADIA SINCE ABOUT THE RULES OF THIS INSTITUTION. AND I ACCEPT THAT THERE IS A MAJORITY PARTY. I'VE LIVED WITH IT EVER SINCE. NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT. AND GENERALLY WE DO EXTREMELY WELL. BUT THIS IS AN EXTREME SITUATION. AND I DON'T CARE WHAT BILLS WE'VE GOT YET BEFORE US. NONE COULD POSSIBLY BE THAT IMPORTANT IN EITHER HOUSE. NO MAKE OR BREAK. THIS ISN'T A CALIFORNIA WAKE UP NEXT WEEK. UNAFFECTED BY THESE WONDERFUL BILLS THAT WERE SO DESPERATELY TRYING. TO RUN THROUGH. IN THIS ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS UNIQUE EMERGENCY. THERE WERE TALKING ABOUT BILLS DYING. BUT THROUGH EXPOSURE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HUMANS DIE MODOC KING ABOUT THE EXAMPLES OF THIS LEGISLATURE TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. WHO THE GOVERNOR. AND WE'VE ASKED AND EXPECTED TO GREATLY INCONVENIENCED THEMSELVES. TO GET US THROUGH. THIS PANDEMIC. THESE ARE STILL PERILOUS TIMES LADIES AND GENTLEMAN. AND I REALLY THE SUFFERS FROM THE OBJECT. THE REPUBLICANS. BEING ONLY ALLOWED THEM TO REMOTE VOTE COULD NOT BE HERE PHYSICALLY PRESENT. LET'S DO OUR CAST SEE WHAT THE RESULTS SHOWING THAT EVER WHO PASSES THE TEST. COME HERE. AND DEBATE. THERE IS A HYPOCRISY OF MAJORITY THAT SOMETIMES BORDERS ON ARROGANCE. I'M DISAPPOINTED IN THE INSTITUTION IN JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO  PRAISED THIS INSTITUTION. RESTORING SOME OF THE INTEGRITY. THAT WE HAD GOTTEN VERY LAZY ABOUT INDEED. SO I HAVE I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO ON THE USE OF. THE BILL SO. PART OF ME WANTS TO TAKE EVERY SINGLE ITEM OFF CONSENT AND DEBATE. AND IF THAT INCONVENIENCES ANYBODY FINE. JUST SEARCH ME FINE. SO LET ME CUT DETAILING OF THE MINUTE MAYBE. THE PRO AND TALK TO THE AUTHOR FOR SOMETHING. THANK YOU SIR NIELSEN MADAM PRO TEM THANK YOURS YOURS. MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU. I A COUPLE OF POINTS OF FACT- WE WILL BE WORKING THROUGHOUT THE WEEKEND ALREADY- WE HAVE- BUDGET ITEMS POLICY ITEMS BILLS. BETWEEN THE HOUSES THAT MATTER TO US AS MEMBERS AND TO OUR CONSTITUENTS WE ALREADY HAVE BEEN SCHEDULED TO WORK THROUGH THE WEEKEND. THIS YEAR IS SUNNY DI THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO END AT MIDNIGHT ON MONDAY AUGUST THIRTY FIRST. WE DON'T HAVE CALL IT A LUXURY IT WASN'T LAST SESSION WHEN WE WENT PAST MIDNIGHT BECAUSE WE HAD TO CLOSE DOWN THE CHAMBERS FOR YET ANOTHER. CHALLENGING SITUATION. WE ARE FOLLOWING PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDELINES AND DIRECTIVES. HE SAW A BODY HAS HAD POLICIES IN PLACE SINCE MID MARCH WHEN WE LEFT. ASKING OUR COLLEAGUES. TWO EIGHT HAIR TO THEIR LEGISLATIVE AND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO DO EVERYTHING TO FOLLOW GUIDELINES SO THAT WE WOULDN'T PUT URSELVES IN THE POSITION TO NOT BE ABLE TO BE HERE. WHEN THE ASSEMBLY I HAD MEMBERS WHO TESTED POSITIVE. WE WEREN'T IN SESSION. AND WE HAD THE TIME AND THE ABILITY TO EXTEND THE COURTESY TO NOT RETURN UNTIL WE HAD SOME CLARITY. STILL FOLLOWING THOSE PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTIVES. OUR CLOCK IS RUNNING OUT WE HAVE LESS AND LESS SOLUTIONS FROM WHICH TO DETERMINE HOW TO PROCEED YESTERDAY WE DID NOT HAVE SESSION BECAUSE I TOOK THE DAY. WITH FIVE THE ADVICE OF OUR SECRETARY OF THE SENATE THE- LEGAL COUNSEL- ASSISTANCE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTOR TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THE POSSIBILITIES AND ALL OF THE OPTIONS. AND HOW SOON COULD MEMBERS RETURN SHOULD ODD TESTING BE DONE. I WANT TO ASSURE MY COLLEAGUES ALL OF THEM I TAKE THIS JOB SERIOUSLY AS THE PRO TEM. THIS IS THE POSITION WE DID NOT WANT TO FIND OURSELVES IN WHICH IS WHY YOU HAVE HEARD ME AGAIN AND AGAIN PLEAD WITH PEOPLE. FOLLOW THE GUIDELINES PLEASE. SO THAT WE CAN FINISH OUT THE SESSION IN THE WAY THAT WE WOULD LIKE CLEARLY WE FACE. ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES AS WE TRY TO GET THROUGH TODAY AND TOMORROW. WE PUT INTO PLACE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSIDER REMOTE VOTING SHOULD IT BECOME NECESSARY. AND THAT IS A TOOL THAT WE NOW HAVE AT OUR DISPOSAL THAT WE INTEND TO FOLLOW THROUGH SO THAT OUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES. ARE ABLE TO TAKE THAT TOOL THAT OPTION AND TO VOTE. ARE YOU SURE YOU ARE I RESPECT THIS INSTITUTION I RESPECT EVERY MEMBER EVERY MEMBER CAME HERE. TO ACCOMPLISH WORK ON BEHALF OF THEIR CONSTITUENTS AND WE NEED TO DO THAT AND I INTEND TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT AND I DO IT WITH GREAT RESPECT FOR EVERY MEMBER OF THIS BODY. DEMOCRAT REPUBLICAN IT DOESN'T MATTER OUR CHARGE IS TO BE RESPECTFUL TO ALL MEMBERS. I HAVE WORKED HARD TO FIND SOLUTIONS WITH THE EXPERTISE TO DO THAT. AND SO IT IS REGRETFUL THAT OUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES ARE NOT HERE TODAY LET ME JUST SAY THAT IF THERE WERE DEMOCRATIC DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS MEMBERS. WHO NEEDED TO BE QUARANTINED. WE WOULD BE DOING EXACTLY THE SAME THING. AND IT WOULD IMPACT LEGISLATION WHETHER DEMOCRATS ARE MISSING OR REPUBLICANS ARE MISSING IT IMPACTS THE OUTCOME OF SOME PIECES OF LEGISLATION. SO WE HAVE ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITY COLLEAGUES. WITH THAT. YOU KNOW WE HAVE WORK TO DO AND WE HAVE LIMITED TIME AND WE ARE LOSING THAT TIME BECAUSE OF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL DEADLINE OF MIDNIGHT ON AUGUST THIRTY FIRST SO. PRESIDENT I'M HAPPY TO PROCEED AND AS SOON AS WE HAVE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION- I WILL MAKE URE THAT THE BODY HAS IT BUT TODAY WE HAVE WORK TO DO I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND PRESIDENT FOR THOSE COMMENTS.

ASSEMBLY BILL TWO FORTY EMPLOYMENT SOME OF THE CHIEF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT AROSE FROM AN AUDIT PUBLISHED THIS YEAR OF LEASES AND OTHER THIRD PARTY USES OF THE STATE PROPERTY AT THE CALIFORNIA VETERANS HOMES. IT STRENGTHENS AND CLARIFIES EXISTING LAW LIMITING LEASES THE FIVE YEARS WHAT GRANTED SOME DESIRED FLEXIBILITY FOR PUBLIC AGENCIES AND FOR NON PROFITS THAT ARE PROVIDING SERVICES EXCLUSIVELY TO THE VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES. RECOGNIZING THE WAY THOUGH JOHN CHILL HOME IN PARTICULAR IS A SIGNIFICANT COMMUNITY MEMBER WHO USES HAVE INVOLVED OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME THIS BILL ALSO PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR LEGALLY GRANTING LONGER TERM LEASES PROVIDED LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS PROVIDE SOME INCENTIVE FOR LEASES WITH A LONG TERM LEASE TO RENEGOTIATE THEIR CONTRACTS WITHOUT BEING FORCED TO GIVE UP THE LENGTH IN TERMS OF THEIR CONTRACTS. THIS BILL STRENGTHENS EXISTING STANDARDS BY REQUIRING THAT. A GIVEN USE PROVIDES A SUBSTANTIAL DIRECT BENEFIT TO THE HOMES AND ITS MEMBERS. WHICH ARE VETERANS AND DOES NOT DEVIATE FROM THE HOMES FUNCTION AS A LONG TERM CARE FACILITY. THE BILL'S AUTHOR HAS BEEN WORKING HARD TO STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN GRANTING FLEXIBILITY UNDER THE LAW THAT IT KNOWLEDGE IS LONG STANDING ARRANGEMENTS AND CREATING A REGULAR STANDARD.

ORDER PURPORTS TO RESULT IN A FALSE POLICE REPORT AIMED AT HARASSING. A PERSON BASED ON EITHER THEIR SKIN COLOR OR ONE OF THE OTHER PROTECTED CHARACTERISTICS AND WHAT IT DOES IS IMPOSES A FINE FOR A MISDEMEANOR ON A PERSON WHO KNOWINGLY USES NINE ONE ONE FOR THIS PURPOSE. AND PROVIDES ENHANCED PENALTIES FOR KNOWINGLY MAKING FALSE NINE ONE ONE CALLS AND A MEMBER OF A PROTECTED CLASS IN IT CLARIFIES IN CIVIL CODE THAT THE FALSE REPORT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT TARGETING ANOTHER IS NOT A PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATION WHICH THUS ALLOWS THE FALSE REPORT TO BE USED AS EVIDENCE.
