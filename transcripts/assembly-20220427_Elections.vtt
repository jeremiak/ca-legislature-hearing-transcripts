AB SIXTEEN SIXTY UNFORTUNATELY

01:02:46.162 --> 01:02:48.531
WHAT WE HAVE HERE WE BELIEVE IS

01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:50.366
REALLY A SOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:51.267
PROBLEM MULTIPLE STUDIES HAVE

01:02:51.334 --> 01:02:53.069
SHOWN THAT VOTER FRAUD IS

01:02:53.136 --> 01:02:55.304
VANISHINGLY RARE AND THIS IS

01:02:55.371 --> 01:02:57.907
TRUE EVEN IN THE STATES THAT

01:02:57.974 --> 01:02:59.642
HAVE. LARGELY ADOPTED ALMOST ALL

01:02:59.709 --> 01:03:01.410
VOTE BY MAIL LIKE LIKE OREGON

01:03:01.477 --> 01:03:02.745
FOR EXAMPLE INSTEAD OF

01:03:02.812 --> 01:03:04.180
PROTECTING THE INTEGRITY OF

01:03:04.247 --> 01:03:06.182
ELECTIONS AB SIXTEEN SIXTY WOULD

01:03:06.249 --> 01:03:07.116
RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT

01:03:07.183 --> 01:03:08.751
DISENFRANCHISEMENT OF CALIFORNIA

01:03:08.818 --> 01:03:11.487
VOTERS THERE ARE A LOT OF

01:03:11.554 --> 01:03:13.156
INNOCENT REASONS WHY FILE

01:03:13.222 --> 01:03:14.757
ENVELOPES MIGHT ARRIVE IN

01:03:14.824 --> 01:03:16.592
ELECTIONS OFFICES IN IN PERFECT

01:03:16.659 --> 01:03:18.494
CONDITION WITH THINGS THAT ARE

01:03:18.561 --> 01:03:20.563
CITED AS SIGNS OF DAMAGE IN THE

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:22.698
BILL AND WE DO APPRECIATE THE

01:03:22.765 --> 01:03:24.033
AMENDMENTS THAT WERE MADE BUT WE

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:25.468
DON'T THINK THEY FUNDAMENTALLY

01:03:25.535 --> 01:03:26.969
ADDRESS THESE THESE ISSUES THAT

01:03:27.036 --> 01:03:30.006
CONCERN US SO GREATLY. SO USPS

01:03:30.072 --> 01:03:32.175
MAIL SORTERS THINK INCREASE THEY

01:03:32.241 --> 01:03:33.409
CAN MARK THEY CAN EVEN RIP

01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:36.212
ENVELOPES RIGHT PEOPLE MAKE

01:03:36.279 --> 01:03:38.347
MISTAKES THEY THEY WILL OPEN

01:03:38.414 --> 01:03:40.917
THEIR BACKUP CORRECT THE MISTAKE

01:03:40.983 --> 01:03:42.285
SEE WHAT BACK UP WITH TAPE I'VE

01:03:42.351 --> 01:03:44.253
DONE THAT THAT SORT OF THING

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:45.888
THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE DAMAGE AS

01:03:45.955 --> 01:03:48.024
FAR AS I CAN TELL WITH THIS

01:03:48.090 --> 01:03:49.825
BILL- WHILE THERE ARE EXAMPLES

01:03:49.892 --> 01:03:53.362
OF WHAT DAMAGE CAUGHT. THERE'S

01:03:53.429 --> 01:03:54.797
NO CLEAR DEATH. IN THE BILL AS

01:03:54.864 --> 01:03:57.800
TO WHAT IS ACTUALLY DAMAGE SO.

01:03:57.867 --> 01:04:00.336
THAT LACK OF A CLEAR DEFINITION

01:04:00.403 --> 01:04:01.571
WE BELIEVE- CREATES A REAL

01:04:01.637 --> 01:04:03.539
PROBLEM. SO BECAUSE OF THIS

01:04:03.606 --> 01:04:04.407
EVERY ACCOUNT WOULD HAVE TO USE

01:04:04.473 --> 01:04:06.242
THEIR OWN DISCRETION A RECIPE

01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:07.577
FOR INCONSISTENT APPLICATION

01:04:07.643 --> 01:04:09.412
THAT WOULD. TELL UNDERMINE

01:04:09.478 --> 01:04:11.347
PUBLIC TRUST IN OUR ELECTIONS

01:04:11.414 --> 01:04:12.848
AND THE CURA CON TOOK THE

01:04:12.915 --> 01:04:14.684
PROCESS IT'S CONTEMPLATED BY THE

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:17.053
BILL WOULD NOT LEAVE TIME. FOR

01:04:17.119 --> 01:04:18.321
MOST PEOPLE TO CAST A

01:04:18.387 --> 01:04:19.855
REPLACEMENT BALLOT PRIOR TO THE

01:04:19.922 --> 01:04:21.757
CLOSE OF THE ELECTION. AND THEN

01:04:21.824 --> 01:04:23.492
THE BILL PROHIBITS ELECTIONS

01:04:23.559 --> 01:04:24.460
OFFICIALS FROM COUNTING THE

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:25.728
BALLOT IF THE ENVELOPES

01:04:25.795 --> 01:04:28.764
PERCEIVED TO BE DAMAGED SO.

01:04:28.831 --> 01:04:30.266
HONESTLY CAN YOU IMAGINE VOTERS

01:04:30.333 --> 01:04:32.201
REACTIONS IF THEY SIGN THEIR

01:04:32.268 --> 01:04:33.703
BALLOT THEY TAKE THE TIME TO

01:04:33.769 --> 01:04:35.638
FILL OUT A VERY LONG BALLOT THEY

01:04:35.705 --> 01:04:37.907
GET EVEN IN TIME. AND THEN

01:04:37.974 --> 01:04:39.208
EVERYTHING IS RIGHT. AND THEN

01:04:39.275 --> 01:04:40.509
THEY GET A NOTIFICATION LATER

01:04:40.576 --> 01:04:42.011
THAT THEIR BALLOT WASN'T COUNTED

01:04:42.078 --> 01:04:44.313
COUNTED BECAUSE IT WAS PERCEIVED

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:46.749
TO BE DAMAGED. I THINK HERE

01:04:46.816 --> 01:04:50.486
WOULD BE. IT VERY RIGHTEOUS

01:04:50.553 --> 01:04:52.154
OUTRAGE IN THAT SIR KIND

01:04:52.221 --> 01:04:54.390
CIRCUMSTANCE FINALLY TAMPERING

01:04:54.457 --> 01:04:56.392
ALREADY ILLEGAL RIGHT COUNTIES

01:04:56.459 --> 01:04:58.094
HAVE LEGAL PROCESSES IN PLACE TO

01:04:58.160 --> 01:04:59.695
INVESTIGATE WHAT THEY PERCEIVED

01:04:59.762 --> 01:05:01.764
TO BE TEMPERING AND GIVEN THE

01:05:01.831 --> 01:05:02.865
RARITY OF THE PROBLEM IT'S CLEAR

01:05:02.932 --> 01:05:05.468
THAT THE WHAT WE HAVE IN PLACE

01:05:05.534 --> 01:05:06.836
IS SUFFICIENT. ELECTIONS

01:05:06.902 --> 01:05:08.337
OFFICIALS REPROCESSING BALLOTS

01:05:08.404 --> 01:05:09.705
THAT SHOW SIGNS OF VEGAN

01:05:09.772 --> 01:05:11.641
UNDEFINED DAMAGE WOULD CAUSE

01:05:11.707 --> 01:05:13.743
VALVO TO BE REJECTED AND IT'S A

01:05:13.809 --> 01:05:16.112
DRACONIAN OF RESPONSE TO A

01:05:16.178 --> 01:05:17.280
PROBLEM THAT HASN'T EVEN BEEN

01:05:17.346 --> 01:05:19.181
SHOWN TO EXIST SO THE LEAGUE OF

01:05:19.248 --> 01:05:21.584
WOMEN VOTERS MUST RESPECTFULLY

01:05:21.651 --> 01:05:23.919
URGE A NO VOTE ON IT. THANK YOU

MOST ABOUT THIS BILL WHICH IS

01:21:37.392 --> 01:21:38.760
HOW MANY BUSINESSES WOULD HAVE

01:21:38.827 --> 01:21:39.427

01:21:39.494 --> 01:21:41.463
CAMPAIGNS- HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:21:41.529 --> 01:21:42.430
THE MORE WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO

01:21:42.497 --> 01:21:44.966
DO A FULL ASSESSMENT ON A MORE

01:21:45.033 --> 01:21:45.533

STATE- I WOULD POINT OUT TO THE

01:21:51.573 --> 01:21:53.475
BILL'S SPONSORS ON STUDY. WHICH

01:21:53.541 --> 01:21:54.576
SHOWS THAT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD

01:21:54.643 --> 01:21:57.112
PERMIT 98% OF S. AND P. FIVE

01:21:57.178 --> 01:21:57.612
HUNDRED COMPANIES FROM

PARTICIPATING IN THE POLITICAL

01:21:58.813 --> 01:22:03.084
PROCESS THAT'S 98% CHAU. THE

01:22:03.151 --> 01:22:04.386
BILL ALSO RAISES CONSTITUTIONAL

01:22:04.452 --> 01:22:06.521
QUESTIONS I KNOW. ASSEMBLY

01:22:06.588 --> 01:22:08.323

01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:09.624
REFERRED TO A SIMILAR PROPOSAL

01:22:09.691 --> 01:22:11.960
IN SEATTLE- HOWEVER AT THE

01:22:12.027 --> 01:22:13.361
WASHINGTON STATE DEMOCRATIC

01:22:13.428 --> 01:22:15.864
PARTY'S REQUEST- PERKINS CARILLO

01:22:15.930 --> 01:22:17.165
LONGTIME MOSTLY DEMOCRATIC LAW

01:22:17.232 --> 01:22:19.668
FIRM. DID AN ANALYSIS OF THE

01:22:19.734 --> 01:22:22.270
PROPOSAL AND- THEY RESPONDED BY

01:22:22.337 --> 01:22:23.638
SAYING THAT QUOTE IT WOULD

01:22:23.705 --> 01:22:24.606
ALMOST CERTAINLY FACE

01:22:24.673 --> 01:22:26.374
CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE IN SUCH

01:22:26.441 --> 01:22:27.642
A CHALLENGE WOULD HAVE A STRONG

01:22:27.709 --> 01:22:29.544
LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS ON THE

01:22:29.611 --> 01:22:32.280
MERITS. OF THE COMMITTEE HEARS

01:22:32.347 --> 01:22:34.816
VERY. SMART ANALYSIS POINTS THAT

01:22:34.883 --> 01:22:36.718
QUOTE IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THIS

01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:37.986
BILL COULD RESTRICT THE ABILITY

01:22:38.053 --> 01:22:39.521
OF BUSINESS ENTITIES TO MAKE

01:22:39.587 --> 01:22:41.022
CONTRIBUTIONS AND EXPENDITURES

01:22:41.089 --> 01:22:42.757
IN ELECTIONS BASED ON RELATIVELY

01:22:42.824 --> 01:22:44.626
LOW LEVELS OF FOREIGN OWNERSHIP.

01:22:44.693 --> 01:22:45.860
IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER A COURT

01:22:45.927 --> 01:22:47.829
WOULD UPHOLD THIS BILL AGAINST A

01:22:47.896 --> 01:22:48.463
CHALLENGE THAT ITS PROVISIONS

01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:51.032
VIOLATE THE FIRST AMENDMENT TO

01:22:51.099 --> 01:22:52.133
THE U. S. CONSTITUTION- WE ALSO

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:55.370
FIND THE BILL. A FAIRLY BROAD-

01:22:55.437 --> 01:22:58.139
AND- WHILE IT WOULD LIKELY APPLY

01:22:58.206 --> 01:23:02.110
TO- CONCORD AMERICAN BUSINESSES-

01:23:02.177 --> 01:23:03.812
A PARAPHRASE ONE SECTION FROM

01:23:03.878 --> 01:23:05.313
THE ANALYSIS HERE WHICH REALLY

01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:07.215
DIDN'T EXCELLENT JOB THAT- EVEN

01:23:07.282 --> 01:23:08.249
WERE A BUSINESS THAT IS

01:23:08.316 --> 01:23:10.452
ORGANIZED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE

U. S. HAS ITS PRINCIPAL PLACE OF

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:14.356
BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES.

01:23:14.422 --> 01:23:17.058
AND WE'RE ALL THE INDIVIDUALS

01:23:17.125 --> 01:23:17.892
INVOLVED IN THE- PROCESS. THE

01:23:17.959 --> 01:23:18.827
BILL MAKES POLITICAL

01:23:18.893 --> 01:23:20.662
CONTRIBUTIONS THAT THIS BUSINESS

01:23:20.729 --> 01:23:22.030
COULD STILL BE PROHIBITED BY

01:23:22.097 --> 01:23:22.964
THIS BILL FOR MAKING

01:23:23.031 --> 01:23:25.300
CONTRIBUTIONS OR EXPENDITURES.

01:23:25.367 --> 01:23:26.534
IN STATE AND LOCAL ELECTIONS IN

01:23:26.601 --> 01:23:28.803
CALIFORNIA- IT'S CLEAR THAT THIS

01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:30.839
PROPOSAL IS MEANT TO HAVE THE

01:23:30.905 --> 01:23:32.540
BUSINESS COMMUNITY UNILATERALLY

01:23:32.607 --> 01:23:34.075
DISARM IN TERMS OF ITS

01:23:34.142 --> 01:23:34.709
PARTICIPATION IN THE POLITICAL

01:23:34.776 --> 01:23:38.179
PROCESS- WE FIND SOME OF THE

02:06:39.992 --> 02:06:41.627
CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM ABOUT

02:06:41.694 --> 02:06:44.029
THIS- AND IT'S BEEN A CONCERN

02:06:44.096 --> 02:06:45.764
FOR QUITE SOME TIME BECAUSE OF

02:06:45.831 --> 02:06:47.499
SOME THINGS CAN BE DONE-

02:06:47.566 --> 02:06:50.436
WITHOUT- A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE

02:06:50.502 --> 02:06:52.071
AND AMENDING THE CONSTITUTION-

02:06:52.137 --> 02:06:53.238
WILL WE HAVE TO SORT OF

02:06:53.305 --> 02:06:54.907
COLLECTIVELY DECIDED ON A

02:06:54.974 --> 02:06:57.109
STRATEGY OF PUTTING FORWARD A-

02:06:57.176 --> 02:06:57.710
NUMBER OF BILLS TO MAKE THIS

02:06:57.776 --> 02:07:00.713

TWO. HAS THE FOLKS THE VOTERS

02:07:03.282 --> 02:07:06.185
FOCUS ON THE RECALL ONLY AND NOT

02:07:06.251 --> 02:07:08.954
DEALING WITH THE CONFUSION OF

02:07:09.021 --> 02:07:10.322
WHO WERE ALL THE REPLACEMENT

02:07:10.389 --> 02:07:11.390
CANDIDATES ARE TRYING TO FIGURE

02:07:11.457 --> 02:07:13.425
THAT OUT ONE OF THE BIG THINGS

02:07:13.492 --> 02:07:14.593
THAT- I'M TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT

02:07:14.660 --> 02:07:17.496
WE'VE SEEN IS THAT AS MORE MORE

02:07:17.563 --> 02:07:19.164
WEALTH GETS CONCENTRATED IN THE

02:07:19.231 --> 02:07:20.766
HANDS OF THE SMALLER NUMBER OF

02:07:20.833 --> 02:07:22.368
PEOPLE PEOPLE ARE WEAPONIZING

02:07:22.434 --> 02:07:24.470
THE RECALL CAMPAIGN AND PEOPLE

02:07:24.536 --> 02:07:27.106
ARE USING THE RECALL CAMPAIGN TO

02:07:27.172 --> 02:07:29.742
GET THEMSELVES ELECTED- AND- WE

02:07:29.808 --> 02:07:32.411
HAVE A CLASSIC EXAMPLE- IN THE

02:07:32.478 --> 02:07:34.913
CITY OF OXNARD LARGEST CITY AND

02:07:34.980 --> 02:07:38.584
COUNTY OF INTER A- A CHARACTER

02:07:38.650 --> 02:07:39.718
COULD NOT WIN IN THE REGULAR

02:07:39.785 --> 02:07:41.387
ELECTION IMMEDIATELY LAUNCHES A

02:07:41.453 --> 02:07:44.690
RECALL AGAINST ALL FOUR PEOPLE-

02:07:44.757 --> 02:07:47.126
ON THE CITY COUNCIL- AND- NONE

02:07:47.192 --> 02:07:49.728
OF THOSE ARE SUCCESSFUL- BUT

02:07:49.795 --> 02:07:50.295
CLEARLY THE INDIVIDUAL WAS

02:07:50.362 --> 02:07:52.765
TRYING TO SEE IF THEY COULD PULL

02:07:52.831 --> 02:07:54.166

02:07:54.233 --> 02:07:56.001
PULL. HI IN THE GENERAL ELECTION

02:07:56.068 --> 02:07:57.903

02:07:59.505 --> 02:08:01.340

WHICH IS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT

02:08:06.545 --> 02:08:09.348
HAS AND CAN CREATE WHATEVER

02:08:09.415 --> 02:08:10.849
PROCEDURES THEY WANT TO TRY TO

02:08:10.916 --> 02:08:13.052
FILL THAT IN BUT IT DOESN'T

02:08:13.118 --> 02:08:15.888

UP MAKING IT A RESPONSIBILITY OF

02:23:28.333 --> 02:23:29.233

RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CLERKS HE

02:23:30.969 --> 02:23:32.470
HAD A DOUBLE RESPONSIBILITY

02:23:32.537 --> 02:23:34.839

HAVE RESPONSIBILITY TO SOMEHOW

02:24:04.569 --> 02:24:05.536
