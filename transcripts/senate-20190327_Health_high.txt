SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO YOU GOT THREE MINUTES APIECE YES THREE YOU CAN THE TWO MINUTES A PIECE -- AGAIN KAMALA THE SIX MINUTES AND YOU NOT TO USE UP ALL SIX MINUTES -- AND THEN AFTER THAT WE TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT PUBLIC COMMENT IS BASICALLY NAME YOUR ORGANIZATION IF YOU REPRESENT AN ORGANIZATION WHETHER YOU'RE FOR OR AGAINST THE BILL. SO WE'RE NOT -- SO THAT'S TO EXPRESS YOUR SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION SO THAT'S HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT AND WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD. AND ACTUALLY IF YOU DON'T MIND AND PRETEND LET'S FIRST ESTABLISH A QUORUM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL FOR THE CORN. HAND HERE AND HERE STONE STONE HERE DRAWS SO YES HEROES I WAS HERE GROW [inaudible] HER TADO. LEYVA MITCHELL MONNING HERE MONNING IS HERE RUBIO. RUBIO IS HERE OKAY WE HAVE A QUORUM OKAY -- META PRO TEM WILL COME IN THE FOR YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COLLEAGUES I ALSO WANT. TO THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME GO FIRST MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M HERE% TODAY TO PRESENT SB. ONE SIXTY FIVE SB ONE SIXTY FIVE IS ANOTHER STEP IN OUR EFFORT TO DEVELOP A MECHANISM THAT WILL ENSURE THAT LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT ARE ELLIE PEAS. OF MEDI CAL ENROLLEES HAVE QUALIFIED IN PERSON LANGUAGE INTERPRETER SERVICES WHEN THEY VISIT THEIR MEDICAL PROVIDER. I TOOK OVER THIS ISSUE FROM FORMER SPEAKER OPERAS EMERITUS PER AS WHEN I BECAME SPEAKER IN THE ASSEMBLY AND TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL ESTABLISHED A FRAMEWORK FOR QUALIFIED WORKFORCE THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE WHENEVER AN INTERPRETER. WAS NEEDED IN A MEDICAL SETTING AFTER THREE UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS INCLUDING TWO VETOES WE TRIED A NEW APPROACH. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN BUDGET THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION AGREED TO A THREE MILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION FOR THE SUPPORT. OF ACTIVITIES RELATED TO A MEDICAL INTERPRETER PILOT PROJECT STUDY OR BOTH. THE ACCOMPANYING BILL AB SIX THIRTY FIVE AT THAT TIME A TWENTY SIXTEEN HAS SINCE BEEN INTERPRETED. BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES MAYBE WE NEED INTERPRETERS THEIR GOAL I DIDN'T SAY THAT ON THE RECORD. HI TO ME THAT THE STUDY MUST BE UNDERTAKEN AND COMPLETED PRIOR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY PILOT PROJECTS. AFTER MUCH DELAY OF VENDOR WAS SELECTED A CONTRACT SIGNED AND THE STUDY FINALLY BEGIN IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR. AS THE AUTHOR I'M HERE TO TELL YOU AND I HAD MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONS WITH -- MOST OF YOU OVER THE YEARS -- THAT WAS NOT CONSISTENT WITH OUR INTENT THE PURPOSE OF SB ONE SIXTY FIVE IS TO CLARIFY OUR VIEW OF THAT AGREEMENT. MISTER CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES I KNOW THAT BASED ON YOUR OWN PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCES OR FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE IN THE LEGISLATURE ALL OF YOU ARE AWARE OF THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF OUR MEDI CAL POPULATION. AND THE LANGUAGE DIVERSITY THAT IS CALIFORNIA. SO JUST A FEW FACTS ACCORDING TO DH CS RESEARCH AND ANALYTICAL STUDIES DIVISION THE REPORT ROUGHLY SAYS IT 38%. OF ALL MEDICARE ELIGIBLE ENROLLEES REPORT A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH AS THEIR PRIMARY SPOKEN LANGUAGE SPANISH VIETNAMESE CANTONESE MANDARIN ARMENIAN MOST FREQUENTLY REPORTED LANGUAGES AMONG MEDI CAL IS NON ENGLISH SPEAKERS. WHEN THE NUMBER OF MEDI CAL ENROLLEES WHOSE PRIMARY LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH? AND IT GEOGRAPHIC REGION REACHES A CERTAIN NUMBER OR PERCENTAGE KNOWN AS A THRESHOLD THE MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE REQUIRED TO TRANSLATE IMPORTANT WRITTEN DOCUMENTS. IN ADDITION THERE'S A GENERAL REQUIREMENT THAT ALL ELLIE P. ENROLLEES BE PROVIDED ORAL INTERPRETATION SERVICES. HOWEVER THE ACTUAL DELIVERY OF INTERPRETATION SERVICES IS NOT SYSTEMATICALLY PROVIDED OR MONITORED. IT IS GENERALLY LOOK GENERALLY LEFT UP TO EACH PROVIDER AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS HAS RESULTED IN THE USE OF ON QUALIFIED INTERPRETERS. WHICH COULD INCLUDE FAMILY MEMBERS IN SOME CASES ARE THE KIDS OR FRIENDS AND THAT HAS AN IMPACT ON THE ABILITY -- TO IT HERE TOO MEDICAL DIRECTIONS OF MEDICAL PERFECTION YOU PROFESSIONALS TO GET -- THE QUALITY OF CARE THAT YOU NEED SO THE CLARIFICATION IN THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT NO FURTHER TIME IS WASTED AND THE DH CS CAN BE IN ESTABLISHING PILOT PROJECTS% WITH THE ULTIMATE GOAL. OF DEVELOPING A SYSTEM TO INSURE QUALIFIED INTERPRETERS SO I WOULD YET AGAIN ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AS WE CONTINUE TO TRY TO GET THIS PROGRAM A PILOT'S RUNNING -- UP AND RUNNING -- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I HAVE TWO PEOPLE TO TESTIFY THEY WILL FOLLOW THE TIME LIMIT -- AND CERTAINLY I'M THRILLED TO HAVE BOTH OF THEM HERE HERE MISTER CHAIRMAN. MARKETS CASTER HOME WHO IS A POLICY ADVOCATE WITH THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK AND OF COURSE BRIAN ALISON THE POLITICAL AND LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR OF ASKED ME -- IS HERE TO TESTIFY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MEMBER THEM A WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATORS MARKETS GOT THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK. STEPHEN WAS A SUPPORTER OF THE ORIGINAL A. B. SIX THIRTY FIVE FROM TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN JUST I WISH IT THE THE FUNDING FOR THE STUDY IN THE PILOT PROJECT -- WE HAVE LONG BEEN A VOICE FOR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND HAVE A HISTORY OF ADVOCATING FOR CULTURALLY AND CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE SERVICES. IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM -- OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS OF SHARED PERSONAL STORIES THAT DESCRIBE THEIR FEAR NAVIGATING THE HEALTH SYSTEM. DESCRIBING THE INAPPROPRIATE CARE THE RECEIVE WHEN THE TEMPERATURES ARE NOT USED AND HAVE EXPRESSED THE NEED FOR QUALIFIED AND CULTURALLY. COMPETENT INTERPRETERS. AS ONE OF OUR PARTNERS PUT IT IT'S CLEAR NO CHILD OR ANYONE SHOULD BE FORCED TO INTERPRET. FOR ONE'S OWN FAMILY MEMBERS THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IN THE INTRICATE SYSTEM -- OF HEALTH. SB ONE SIXTY FIVE INSURERS CALIFORNIA'S MOVING FLOOR WITH THE GOAL OF PROVIDING LINGUISTIC APPROPRIATE INTERPRETATION SERVICES BY EXTENDING THE SUNSET DATE OF ITERPRETATION STUDY AND ALLOWING PILOT PROJECTS TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTING -- STRATEGIES FROM THAT STUDY THESE IS MORE PROUD TO SUPPORT THE SP ONE SIXTY FIVE I THINK THE PROPER TIME FOR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. WITH THE CHAIR MEMBERS BRIAN OFTEN ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES -- PLEASED TO BE HERE -- S. -- IN SUPPORT OF THE PRO TERMS ARE. SENATE BILL ONE SIXTY FIVE A WE WORK WITH US IN IRAQ IS NOW -- FOR MANY YEARS SHE REFERENCE TO LAUNCH A PILOT PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA TO COMPREHENSIVELY ASSESS -- HOW TO ADDRESS WELL KNOWN DEFICIENCIES AND LIVER AMERICA A MEDICAL INTERPRETATION SERVICES AND MEDICAL SYSTEM -- A REVIEW OF ACADEMIC LITERATURE -- CONDUCTED BY OUR INTERNATIONAL UNION SUGGEST WHAT COMMONSENSE SUGGEST -- THE IN PERSON MEDICAL INTERPRETATION SERVICES ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO PROVIDE HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS WHO SPEAK ENGLISH LESSON WELL ON THAT LITERATURE CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES THE NEED FOR IN VALUE OF A TRAINED IN PERSON MEDICAL INTERPRETATIONS WORK FORCE -- AND CLEAR ADVANTAGES. SUCH AS HIGHER QUALITY OF CARE PATIENT SATISFACTION CULTURAL COMPETENCE AND THE CAPTURE OF CRITICAL NONVERBAL CUES OVER REMOTE. INTERPRETATION SERVICES WITHOUT IN PERSON INTERPRETERS HEALTH CARE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS WHETHER IT'S A POSITION -- LIKE DOCTOR PAN -- WAR PHARMACISTS -- LIKE CENTER STONE ARE FORCED TO RELY ON LANGUAGE LINES OVER THE PHONE FOR THE FAMILY MEMBERS OF PATIENTS AS HAS BEEN REFERENCED -- FOR IN SOME INSTANCES EVEN MORE INFORMALLY -- HOUSEKEEPERS AND JANITORS START TO PROVIDE TRANSLATIONS ALL OF THESE ALTERNATIVES ARE MORE LIKELY. TO RESULT MISS COMMUNICATIONS A VITAL INFORMATION -- EITHER BY THE PATIENT TO THE POSITION OR THE HEALTH PROFESSIONAL TO THE PATIENT -- THEN INTERPRET IN PERSON INTERPRETATION BY SOMEONE WHO IS TRYING TO PROVIDE THAT SERVICE -- SO S.

NUMBER ITEM NUMBER TWO SB TWELVE CENTER B&lt;c.cyan&gt;.&lt;/c&gt; OF MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS -- I WILL NOW PRESENT YES TWELVE SB TWELVES A BILL TO ESTABLISH AN INTEGRATED YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM. ADMINISTERED BY THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION -- THE GOAL OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO ASSIST SERIES OF YOUTH DROP IN CENTERS. OF IN MENTAL HEALTH CENTERS. TO PROVIDE PREVENTION EARLY. INTERVENTION SERVICES TO USE -- AGE. TWELVE TO TWENTY FIVE NOW YOUNG PEOPLE WITH EMERGING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES HAVE DIFFICULT FINDING TIMELY. APPROPRIATE AND TREATMENT AND A SERVICE SYSTEM THAT CAN RESPOND TO THEIR NEEDS. TWO THIRDS OF OUR ADOLESCENTS WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE EPISODE. ACTUALLY DID NOT GET TREATMENT IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE LOW INCOME FAMILIES ARE EVEN LESS LIKELY TO OBTAIN TREATMENT. BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF EARLY IDENTIFICATION INTERVENTION SERVICES YOUNG PEOPLE OFTEN DO NOT REACH. OUR HEALTH SOCIAL SERVICE OR JUSTICE SYSTEMS UNTIL THEIR MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS HAVE BECOME MORE SEVERE. AND OFTEN MORE DIFFICULT AND COSTLY. TO TO TREAT. AND THIS CAN LEAD TO DEVASTATING OUTCOMES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AS WE HAVE SEEN WITH ON PRESIDENT -- INCREASE IN USE SUICIDE -- OVER INCARCERATION EXCEPT AROUND. WITH MORE MORE THAN -- 75% OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES DEVELOPING BEFORE A PERSON TURNS TWENTY FIVE EARLY DETECTION AND TREATMENT GREATLY IMPROVES THE HEALTH OF ADOLESCENTS. AS THE TRANSITION -- TO ADULTHOOD THIS BILL TAKES PROACTIVE STEPS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF UNDERSERVED ERROR ON UNSERVED VIEW. BY BOWSTRING THE MENTAL HEALTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT INFRASTRUCTURE. FOR ADOLESCENTS REGARDLESS OF INSURANCE IMMIGRATION STATUS. OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE MADE DECISIONS OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS TO PRIVATIZE SUPPORT. FOR EARLY INTERVENTION FOR ADOLESCENTS ONE INNOVATION INNOVATIVE AND AN EXAMPLE OF A NATIONAL. COMMITMENT TO EARLY MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT. IS THE HEAD SPACE PROGRAM. THIS IS THE AUSTRALIAN MODEL FOR TREATING YOU WITH EMERGING MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. AND WHICH HAS BECOME A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT. IN THAT NATION'S MENTAL HEALTH LANDSCAPE. HAS BATES APPROACH APPROACHES THE YOUTH WELLNESS AND A COMPREHENSIVE AND USER FRIENDLY WAY -- THE LED BY MEMBERS OF AN ACTIVE USE LOCAL USED ADVISORY GROUP -- TWO DESIGN SERVICES -- AND ENVIRONMENT THAT THEY WOULD LIKE MOST LIKE TO SEE IN THEIR COMMUNITY. THIS YEAR A TWENTY FOUR MEMBER YOUTH ADVISORY GROUP WAS CONVENE. TO ENSURE THAT THE USE VOICE IS AT THE FOREFRONT. OF THE HEAD SPACE CENTER EXPERIENCE. ALSO CENTER CENTRAL TO HEAD SPACE MODEL IS TO EMPHASIZE SUPPORT IN CULTURAL COMPETENCE. FOR FOR GROUPS LIKE THEY'LL BE G. Q. USE HOMELESS SHOES AND MINORITY -- YOU'VE COMMUNITIES NOW AFTER AUSTRALIA IMPLEMENT THEIR HEAD SPACE PROGRAM THEY ACTUALLY SAW A 60% RATE OF IMPROVEMENT. AND YOU'VE THAT RECEIVE CARE -- THE SUCCESS IN THE AUSTRALIAN MODEL IS INSPIRING AND WE CAN EMULATED HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- SINCE THE INSTITUTION OF THIS PROJECT -- IS THAT WE WE HAVE -- THERE THERE IS A HIGH INTEREST IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. TO TO PARTICIPATE FOR PROJECTS UNDERWAY IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY STAFFORD -- SCHOOL PSYCHIATRY HAS PARTNERED WITH THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT TELL PROVIDE SERVICES FOR THESE PROGRAMS. THE PROGRAM HAS ALSO GARNERED IN KIND SUPPORT. FROM OTHER PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING THE LUCILLE PACKARD'S CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL. THROUGH COLLABORATIONS THE CENTERS WILL BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE GRANTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES AND ELSEWHERE. THE SERVICE THE CENTERS WILL BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE FEDERAL FINANCIAL PARTICIPATION. FOR MEDI CAL FOR SERVICES RENDERED OFF SITTING. THE COST OF OPERATION. THIS BILL -- PROVIDES IN IN A WAY INNOVATIVE WAY TO INCREASE ACCESS TO YOU MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR COUNTIES. TO EFFECTIVELY UTILIZE THEIR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDS. AND DRAW DOWN OTHER PORTS OF FUNDING AND I'LL TURN OVER TO MY WITNESSES NOW WE HAVE TONY IT WENT FROM THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT COMMISSION. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. AND EMILY ALISON PROSSER DIRECTOR FOR SENATE. SO TURN OVER TO MY WITNESSES THANK YOU ARE YOU ARE. THANK YOU WITNESSES SUPPORT. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CENTER PAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS EMILY ALISON AND I'M THE POLICY DIRECTOR FOR SENECA FAMILY OF AGENCIES. SENECA IS A STATE WIDE PROVIDER OF CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH CHILD WELFARE EDUCATION AND JUVENILE JUSTICE SERVICES AND WE'RE IN EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES SERVING OVER TEN THOUSAND YOUTH AND FAMILIES EACH YEAR. I WANT TO FIRST EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE TO SENATOR BELL FOR INTRODUCING THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION AND HIS LEADERSHIP ON CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH IN GENERAL -- WE SEE THIS BILL IS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF INNOVATIVE AND SOLUTION FOCUSED INVESTMENTS THAT WE NEED AND CALIFORNIA TO ADDRESS THIS CRITICAL ISSUE OF YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH. SO I WANT TO UNDERSCORE AND REITERATE SOME OF THE DATA THAT THE SENATOR ALREADY SHARED WITH YOU. BUT CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE MOST CRITICAL TIME FOR IDENTIFYING AND ADDRESSING EMERGING MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. 50% OF ALL CHRONIC MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS BEGIN BY AGE FOURTEEN AND 75% BY AGE. TWENTY FIVE AT THE SAME TIME THAT ALL OF THAT DATA IS TRUE WE'RE SEEING THAT MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS FOR YOUTH ARE INCREASING IN BOTH PREVALENCE AND ACUITY AT ALARMING RATES. THE RATE OF SELF REPORTED NO HEALTH NEEDS AMONGST CALIFORNIA ADOLESCENCE HAS INCREASED BY OVER 60% IN THE LAST DECADE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE'S BEEN A 2100% INCREASE IN SUICIDE RATES AMONG GIRLS AGES. TEN TO FOURTEEN DESPITE THE AND AS THE SENATOR SAID YOU OF ALL YOUTH DIAGNOSED WITH A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION NEARLY TWO THIRDS ARE NOT RECEIVING TREATMENT. SO SOMETHING'S GOING ON AND WE NEED MORE SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THIS. SENATEBECAUSE IN SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION BECAUSE IT ADOPTS AN APPROACH TO MENTAL HEALTH THAT WE KNOW CAN WORK. SO OUR AGENCY STARTED THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO MOSTLY AS A RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT PROVIDER BUT HAVE INCREASINGLY DEVOTED OURSELVES -- IN EVERY WAY TO COMMUNITY BASED IN SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. IN RECOGNITION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PREMISE THAT THIS LEGISLATION IS BASED UPON WHICH IS THAT MENTAL HEALTH CARE MUST BE DELIVERED IN A LOCATION THAT IS EASY FOR YOU TO ACCESS. DELIVERED IN A MANNER THAT MAKE MINIMIZES STICK MY AND IS YOUTH DESIGNED AND YOUTH LED. SO THIS ONE STOP SHOP DROP IN CENTER IDEA THAT PUT FORWARD BY THIS BILL WOULD ACCOMPLISH THOSE OBJECTIVES. FIRST IT ALLOWS CENTERS TO BE LOCATED IN PLACES WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE ALREADY ARE AND FEEL COMFORTABLE AS OPPOSED TO ASKING THEM TO GO ELSEWHERE SOMETIMES DURING IN CONVENIENT HOURS TO ACCESS SERVICES. BY REMOVING THOSE TYPES OF LOGISTICAL BARRIERS TO CARE WE KNOW THAT THE RATES OF ACCESS CAN GO UP SO STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT YOUTH ARE MORE LIKELY TO ACCESS MENTAL HEALTH CARE FOR EXAMPLE IN SCHOOL. THAN OTHER LOCATIONS. SECOND THE DESIGN OF THESE CENTERS WOULD BE LED BY TEENS AND YOUNG ADULTS WHICH HELPS ENSURE THAT THE SERVICES ARE DELIVERED IN A MANNER THAT IS APPROPRIATE AND NEEDED AND ABSENT OF STIGMA. SO IMAGINE EXPERIENCING ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION AS A YOUNG PERSON TODAY KNOWING THAT THERE'S A PLACE YOU CAN GO ANY TIME WHERE IT'S NOT OKAY BUT MAYBE EVEN COOL TO ASK FOR HELP. THAT WOULD BE FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT ON THE TYPE OF APPROACH WE OFTEN SEE TODAY. SO THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE KNOW WHAT IS NEEDED AND WE SHOULD FOLLOW THEIR LEAD. SENATE BECAUSE COMMITTED TO THE VISION AND INTENTION OF SB TWELVE AND FINDS THAT THE VALUE OF MAKING SERVICES EASIER FOR YOU TO ACCESS WOULD BE IMMEASURABLE FOR OUR STATE -- WE BELIEVE THAT INVESTING IN MODELS LIKE THIS WOULD BE A HUGE STEP FORWARD FOR CALIFORNIA AND MAKING SURE THAT KIDS GET WHAT THEY NEED -- WHERE THEY NEED AT WHEN THEY NEED IT MOST WE ARE DRIVE VOTE ON SB TOUGH? THANK RICHARD MEMBERS TOBY EWING WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. I KNOW THE LAST FOUR FIVE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN WITH THE COMMISSION WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING TO YOUNG PEOPLE. AND WE TALK WITH THEM ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY FACE IN ACCESSING CARE AND SO YOU HEARD SOME OF THE DATA AND I THINK THE DATA ARE WELL KNOWN AT THIS POINT THAT. AT THIS STAGE IN AND AND AN INDIVIDUAL'S LIFE IS WHEN WE OFTEN SEE THE KINDS OF STRESS OR TRAUMA OR THE CHALLENGES REALLY COMING OUT IN HEALTH CHALLENGES. WE ALSO SEE QUITE OFTEN A FUNDAMENTAL MISMATCH. BETWEEN THE NEEDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE AND THE SERVICES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO HELP THEM OR THAT ARE IN PLACE TO HELP THEM BUT I SHOULDN'T SAY DESIGNED TO HELP THEM. IN IN IN IN IN MANY WAYS I'D SAY USE THIS ANALOGY OF HOW WE DID BANKING IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY NINE TO FIVE MAYBE. NINETY THREE IF YOU HAD TO PASS BOOK YOU CAN GET YOUR MONEY OUT AND WE DIDN'T HAVE YOUR PASSPORT YOUR OUT OF OUT OF LUCK. TODAY WE'VE REALLY BEGUN TO INVEST IN STRATEGIES THAT ARE MUCH MUCH FRIENDLIER MUCH MORE MOBILE MUCH MORE ALIGNED WITH THE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS AS CONSUMERS. WHAT'S NICE ABOUT THE HEAD SPACE MODEL THAT THE THAT LEGISLATION IS SENATOR BALLOTS CAMPAIGNING IS INTENDED TO BRING TO CALIFORNIA. IS IT REALLY STARTS ATTHIS PROMISE OF LET'S TALK WITH YOUNG PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE LET'S DESIGN OUR SYSTEMS NOT BASED ON ON REGULATORY RULES ARE THE MONEY OR A AND AND ALONG ESTABLISH SENSE OF HOW WE NEED TO SERVE PEOPLE BUT LET'S. ASKING PEOPLE IF WE COULD DESIGN A STRATEGY THAT REALLY WAS TAILORED TO WHAT YOUR NEEDS WERE THAT INTEGRATED CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH. SOCIAL EDUCATION EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING SUPPORT WITH THAT LOOK LIKE THE EVIDENCE AROUND THE WORLD SUGGEST THIS WORKS SO FOR THAT REASON THE COMMISSION IS VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT. OF ENGAGING THE STATE TO REALLY REACH OUT AND AND ESTABLISH A SERIES OF PROJECTS THAT WOULD AGAIN THINK ABOUT HOW WE NEED TO DO THIS AND HOW WE CAN DO THIS IN A WAY THAT IS VERY GOOD CENTRIC.

FIVE EIGHTY TWO WELL. THIS IS THE LAST ONE SORRY WE'RE TAKINGSO LONG -- WILL NOW PRESENT FIVE EIGHTY TWO THIS IS SO -- ARE -- SCHOOL COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH CLEVERNESS BILL AND WILL BEGIN BY -- THANKING OUR COMMITTEE. OF FOR THEIR EFFORTS AND ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. AND THIS BILL SB. FIVE EIGHTY TWO IT IS A CRITICAL COMPARTMENTALIZED IN EQUITY IN TRIAGE GRANT FUNDS FOR YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. RESTORING THE 40% CUT IN TRIAGE GRANTS IN -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN IN ADDITION THIS BILL REQUIRES A HALF TO MENTAL HEALTH FUNDS THE ALLOCATED TO YOUTH PROGRAMS INCENTIVIZING COUNTY SCHOOL INTEGRATE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THE SCHOOLS. TO OUR COMMISSION -- IN THE FIRST ROUND OF TRIAGE GRANTS FIFTY FIFTY APPLICATIONS WERE ACTUALLY RECEIVED FOR THE US. ONLY SIX WERE ABLE TO BE FUNDED SPECIFIC TO YOUTH AND ONLY THREE MET OR EXCEEDED THE THRESHOLD FOR FUNDING. THEREFORE THE GRANTS WITH USE CENTRIC PROGRAMS RECEIVED JUST OVER 15% OF THE GRANTS FROM TRIAGE FUNDS. SINCE THAT TIME A MORE USE CENTRIC PARTNERSHIPS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED. BUT WE'RE NOT FUN TO DO THE CUTS IN THE GRANT DOLLARS. SPECIFICALLY THE COMMISSION APPROVED TWELVE PARTNERSHIPS. BY THE END OF THE LAST YEAR -- IN BUT WAS UNABLE TO FUND FOR OTHERS THAT ARE PART. WE EXPECT THE POOL OF APPLICANTS TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE AND GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT NEED TO ADD IN INTEREST TO INTEGRATE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THE SCHOOLS -- WE EXPECT THAT PULLED INCREASE FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE CORE DEMANDS OF LOS ANGELES TEACHERS WHO ARE ON STRIKE EARLIER THIS YEAR WAS TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ON SCHOOL SITES. ON WHAT THEY CALL COMMUNITY BASED SCHOOLS. IN ORDER TO ADEQUATELY SERVE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL AGE POPULATION WE MUST ENSURE THAT HALF OF THE FUNDS ARE TARGETED TO YOU. WHERE THEY ARE IN IN SCHOOL? THIS THIS BILL -- SUPPORT ENJOYS THE SUPPORT OF THE MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS -- ALONG WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS ALTERNATE OPTIONS MY WITNESSES WE HAVE -- AN ESTIMATE SIX OF EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT ARE -- SUFFERING FROM -- MENTAL ILLNESS SO THIS IS IMPORTANT AND I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY WITNESSES. RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER WELL A WITNESSES SUPPORT. WHEN IS CHAIR MEMBERS AGAIN TOBY EWING WITH A MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION -- I I THINK IT WHEN IT COMES TO ADULT MENTAL HEALTH PERHAPS HOMELESSNESS IS THE PUBLIC FACE OF THE CHALLENGES WE FACE IN CALIFORNIA BUT WHEN IT COMES TO CHILDREN AND YOUTH IT IS WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR SCHOOLS -- WHETHER IT'S VIOLENCE OR ISSUES AROUND SUICIDE OR BOWLING THAT THE TRAUMA QUITE OFTEN GETS EXPRESSED THROUGH WHAT'S HAPPENING TO CHILDREN IN OUR SCHOOL ENVIRONMENTS. AS THE SENATOR SAID NGUYEN THAT WHEN THE SPD TO PROGRAM WHICH THE COMMISSION ADMINISTERS FIRST WHEN OUT. THE COMMISSION LEFT UP TO COUNTIES THE DISCRETION TO IDENTIFY WHAT WITH A LEADING PRIORITIES AND BASED ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS THE OVERWHELMING INTEREST WAS IN FUNDING PROGRAMS FOR ADULTS -- IN RESPONSE THE COMMISSION SHIFTED AND REQUIRE THAT HALF OF FUNDS OF THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THE COMMISSION HE MADE AVAILABLE FOR CHILDREN WITH A SET ASIDE OF HALF OF THAT. FOR SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH AND WE WE'VE RECEIVED TREMENDOUS RESPONSE FROM COUNTIES TREMENDOUS RESPONSE FROM SCHOOLS. IN FACT MANY SCHOOLS CONTACTED US TO ASK US IF WE WERE IN A POSITION TO HELP THEM ADDRESS OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS BUT WE WEREN'T ABLE TO BECAUSE OF THE STRUCTURE. OF THE PROGRAM AS IT WAS AT THAT TIME AS IT IS CURRENTLY. WHAT WHAT SB FIVE EIGHTY TWO REALLY INTENDS TO DO IS TO PUT MORE RESOURCES AND RESPOND TO THIS TREMENDOUS NEED THAT WE'RE HEARING FROM SCHOOL DISTRICTS? AND DO IT IN A WAY THAT'S MORE MUCH MORE FLEXIBLE THAN THE WAY SB TWO IS WRITTEN AT THE MOMENT. SO THAT WE CAN BE MORE RESPONSIVE TO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN SCHOOLS. AS THE AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED. WE'RE HEARING ALMOST DAILY STORIES FROM TEACHERS AND PRINCIPALS AROUND THE NEED FOR TRAINING. AROUND THE NEED FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING HOW TO DO REFERRALS -- WE'RE HEARING STORIES OF CHILDREN AS YOUNG AS KINDERGARTEN TALKING ABOUT SUICIDE. THESE ARE HEARTBREAKING STORIES THAT -- COME TO THE COMMISSION AGAIN ALMOST ON A DAILY BASIS AND SO WE ARE VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF THIS OPPORTUNITY. TO BEGIN TO INCENTIVIZE STRONGER COOK SCHOOL COUNTY PARTNERSHIPS AND PUT IN PLACE THE KINDS OF RESOURCES THAT WE NEED TO EQUIP OUR TEACHERS SEE QUIP OUR SCHOOL PERSONNEL AND SUPPORTER COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS. WHO ARE VERY INTERESTED IN WORKING WITH THEIR SCHOOL PARTNERS -- BUT FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS WE NEED TO DEVELOP SOME OF SOME STRATEGY TO IMPROVE STRATEGIES SOME INCENTIVES AND SUPPORT IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS YVONNE CARRY ON WITH ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS -- OUR MEMBERS AND EDUCATORS GENERALLY SPEAKING ARE ARE RESPONDING TO HISTORIC RATES OF TRAUMA ANXIETY. SUICIDE IDEATION -- DEPRESSION -- UNFORTUNATELY WITH MUCH OF THESE TWO WOMEN AND MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS ARE BEING ON MATT DUE TO A LACK OF RESOURCES THAT THAT ALLEY ETS THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION HAVE AVAILABLE TO THEM. MEETING AT THAT THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF OUR OF OUR STUDENTS IS GONNA REQUIRE BROAD COORDINATED EFFORTS BUT WE STRONGLY BELIEVE -- THAT SCHOOLS ARE UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO HELP MEET THAT THAT THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF STUDENTS. BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT STUDENTS SPEND ON CAMPUS BECAUSE OF RELATIONSHIPS THAT OFTEN EXIST BETWEEN STUDENTS. AND STAFF -- RELATIONSHIPS WITH WITH GUARDIANS AND PERRANCE -- NOT TO MENTION THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES DISCREETLY -- AND AND FREE OF STIGMA. TAXES SUPPORTS SB FIVE A TWO BECAUSE IT WILL HELP STRENGTHEN REGIONAL COORDINATION AND BECOME PROVIDES ELEAZAR MUCH NEEDED RESOURCES APPRECIATE SENATOR BAIL ME TO CONTINUE CHAMPION ON THE ON THIS TOPIC AND RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT BACK MIKE FROM ORACLE HAVE BEEN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE. THANK YOU. MORGAN CARLO AT THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. TO SAGACIOUS SENECA FAMILIES AGENCIES STATEWIDE PROVIDER CHILDREN SERVICES IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. DANIELLE MAILLET CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE OF CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES AND SUPPORT HE JERRY FROM IN DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. RESA COMSTOCK CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. CALIFORNIA CIVIL LIBERTIES ADVOCACY AT MEDI HYATT SPEAKING. NINE REPRESENT A SCIENCE SUPPORT. THANK YOU. I SING OTHER PEOPLE'S MICROPHONE ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING ONE A QUESTION FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS THERE'S A MOTION BY SENATOR A STONE. A CENTER RUBIO. THANK YOU CHAIR. WELL FIRST OF ALL I JUST WANNA IN ON THE COMMANDED MISTER BILL FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD ON THESE RICH YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT I'VE DEALT WITH IN SEVENTEEN IN THE CLASSROOM FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS. NOT ONLY IS IT ABOUT THE CHILDREN THAT NEED THE HELP THAT THE SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR THE TEACHERS BUT EVERY TIME A TEACHER SPENDS TIME AWAY. TRYING TO RESOLVE THE SET YOU KNOW PROBLEMS IN THE CLASSROOM OR OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM IT TAKES TIME AWAY FROM OTHER STUDENTS FROM LEARNING AND AND AND BEING FOCUS BUT I WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR THAT -- I KNOW OUR TEACHERS ARE DROWNING I HEAR IT EVERY SINGLE DAY AND SO WHEN APPROPRIATE LIKE TO ADD AS A CO AUTHOR AND WITH THAT I MOVE. THE BILL. I THINK IT'S RIGHT -- BUT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU TAKE A OF FUTURE AMENDMENT I THINK. SO OKAY ANY OTHER -- A YES CENTER MONEY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I ALSO JUST WANT TO THANK SENATOR BILL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THREE BILLS YOU PRESENTED TODAY BUT IN GENERAL ON MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. FOR YOUTH FOR ADULTS FOR COMMUNITIES IT IS CRITICAL TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH OF CALIFORNIA WANT TO THANK YOU AND WITNESSES WHO'VE SUPPORTED YOU TODAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. A SIGNAL THE QUESTIONS -- ALRIGHT SO CENTER ABOUT I WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF AND ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS. THE I THINK IS FIRST OF ALL I SHARE -- YOUR GOAL AND YOUR DESIRE TO GET. MORE OF THIS MONEY TO USE ORIENT PROGRAMS AND THAT IT PRIORITIZE THOSE AND SO CERTAINLY -- YOU KNOW -- THE HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL I THINK THE ONE CONCERN I HAVE AND I APPRECIATE OUR COULD CONVERSATION IS IS THAT -- CERTAINLY WE HAVE MANY MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS YOU KNOW THIS BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE AND AND STATE SENATE AND AND SO WHY CERTAIN WHAT PRIORITIZE USE I I ALSO DON'T HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WE DOZEN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE AND I APPRECIATE YOU IN YOUR TESTIMONY YOU SAID THAT. YOU KNOW WE DO ANTICIPATE MORE PEOPLE WILL APPLY AND I HOPE THAT WILL BE THE CASE BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE AS YOU HAVE OUTLINED THE BILL THAT. AT LEAST HALF OF THE MONEY GOES USE PROGRAMS BUT I'M ALSO CONCERNED AS THIS IS TAXPAYER MONEY THAT. IF WE DON'T GET THOSE APPLICATIONS AND WE DON'T HAVE QUALITY APPLICANTS AND THE MONEY SORT OF SITS THERE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DESIGNATE HALF BUT THERE HAVE WE HAVE GOT THE APPLICATIONS. OF THE QUALITY THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU KNOW I KNOW WHAT THE COMMISSION JUST HANDING OUT MONEY TO SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO DO A GOOD JOB WITH THAT -- THAT WE THEN THE CUMULATIVE BALANCE -- OVER TOO LONG OF A PERIOD OF TIME I MEAN I UNDERSTAND GIVE ME SOME TIME FOR MAYBE GETTING THE WORD OUT DOING THE WORK TO TRY TO GET MORE PEOPLE TO DEVELOP THE KIND OF APPLICATIONS. BUT I JUST DON'T HAVE A SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE SAYS WELL GEE NOT EVEN SPENDING THE MONEY ADD THAT -- THAT WE'RE PAYING TAXES FOR SO I APPRECIATE -- YOU'RE WORKING WITH I STAFF ON THIS -- AND I KNOW THAT YOU WANT YOU KNOW YOU YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND I'M WITH YOU THERE AND I AGREE WITH WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO SO I JUST WANNA BE SURE WE DON'T CREATE A SITUATION -- THOUGH THAT -- WHERE SOMEONE QUESTIONS -- THE FACT THAT WELCOME QUESTIONS A SITUATION THAT MIGHT OCCUR THAT IF THE COMMISSION ISN'T GETTING ABOUT THE MONEY THE TAXPAYER MONEY IS IT GETTING ON TO THE STREETS SO -- I'D CERTAINLY LOOKING FOR TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE GET MORE PEOPLE TO DO THIS APPLICATIONS I'D LIKE TO SEE ALL THAT MONEY GET OUT SO -- OKAY SO WITH THAT -- A THINK IT'S BEEN MOVED BY CENTER STONE I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER QUICK COMMENTS -- CENTER BILL WHICH LIKE THE CLOTHES. I THINK -- THIS IS MORE OR LESS AN ICE BREAKER BETWEEN THE MENTAL HEALTH COMMUNITY AND THE SCHOOL COMMUNITY BECAUSE IN THE PAST THE BINS SILOS SEPARATELY. AND AS WE SAW IN LOS ANGELES AND OAKLAND AND YOU CAN GO ON AND ON THE VARIOUS THE TEACHERS -- ARE NOW SAYING HEY THIS WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE. SUPPORT YOU KNOW IN THE SCHOOLS THE BENEFIT ALL THE KIDS IN THE SCHOOL THEY HAVE A SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR THE CHILDREN IN OUR SCHOOLS SO. SO WE'RE TRYING TO DO THIS IS AN ICE BREAKER. TO HEALTH -- BOTH THE SCHOOL SYSTEM. ACHIEVE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCES AND TRY TO HELP THE EARLY DETECTION INTERVENTION. OF CHILDREN ESPECIALLY. AND I THINK WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE DOING IS ESPECIALLY THOSE IN -- AREAS THAT HAVE A LITTLE MORE TRAUMA OTHER KINDS OF DIFFICULTIES. IN THOSE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES SO THIS WOULD -- IS A STEP TOWARDS WHAT AGO EQUALIZING -- SERVICES IN SCHOOLS TO HAVE THIS KIND OF SUPPORT SYSTEM IN THOSE TYPES OF SCHOOLS TO BE ONE OF SEE IT THAT WAY MINUTES. TALK ABOUT EQUALIZING. EDUCATION I THINK YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS KIND OF SUPPORT SYSTEM SERGEANT ABOVE THANK YOU. HI THANK YOU SO AT THIS.

NEXT UP ON FILE ORDER CENTER HILL WELCOME I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN VERY PATIENT. AND DID YOU WANT TO TAKE THEM YOU HAVE TO BILLS JOINT TAKE THEM IN THE ORDERED AND THE FILE OKAY SO WE ARE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER. THREE SB THIRTY EIGHT CENTER HEALTH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES -- IN THEN I ALSO HAVE MY JOINT AUTHOR OF SENATOR GLAZER WHO WILL HAVE SOME COMMENTS TO MAKE AS WELL AND WE'RE HONORED TO HAVE HIM WITH US TODAY -- SB. THIRTY EIGHT YOUTH USAGE OF FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS HAS SURGED RECENTLY AS MANY OF US KNOW I THINK COLLEAGUES THE STATISTICS WILL SHOCK YOU AS THEY DID TO ME. BETWEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN ONE POINT FIVE MILLION MORE YOUTH STARTED FLIGHT USING FLAVORED ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES. THE STUNNING GROWTH AMOUNTED USED BY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. AND A 48% INCREASE BY MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS. THE YEAR OVER YEAR SPIKE ANY CIGARETTE USE ALSO DROVE UP USE OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS OVERALL TO ALMOST FOUR POINT NINE MILLION STUDENTS IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN A RACING WHAT HAD BEEN DECADES OF DECLINES IN USED TOBACCO USE YOU. WE ARE A USE WE ARE AT THE CENTER OF A YOUTH. TOBACCO EPIDEMIC. TAKING A PAGE FROM BIG TOBACCO'S PLAYBOOK THE CIGARETTE COMPANIES ARE DIRECTLY TARGETING YOUTH WITH KID FRIENDLY FLAVORS LIKE MANGO AND COTTON CANDY AND CENTER GLAZER WILL HAVE OME EXAMPLES CARTOON CHARACTERS ON PACKAGING. AND YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE ADVERTISING CAMPAIGNS SOME VAGUE COMPANIES EVEN SPONSOR SOCIAL MEDIA INFLUENCERS UNDER TWENTY ONE TO USE AND PROMOTE THEIR PRODUCTS TO YOUTH MARKETS. IT'S CRUCIAL THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE PUBLIC HEALTH RISK FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS POSE FAVORS MATCH THE NATURALLY HARSH TASTE OF TOBACCO MAKING THESE PRODUCTS EASIER TO USE AND MORE APPEALING TO YOU. IN FACT LABOR TOBACCO USE IS HIGHER WITH. HIGHER WITH YOUTH THEN WITH ADULTS. AMONG TOBACCO USERS 80% OF KIDS AGES TWELVE TO SEVENTEEN REPORT CURRENT USE OF A FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS COMPARED 2406%. OF ADULTS TWENTY FIVE IN OVER FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS LIKE MENTHOL HAVE BEEN USED FOR GENERATIONS TO TARGET COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES IN LGBT Q. COMMUNITIES ADDING TO THE HEALTH DISPARITIES IN POPULATIONS ALREADY IMPACTED BY SOCIAL INEQUITIES. SB THIRTY EIGHT TAKE SWIFT ACTION TO PROTECT YOUTH AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS FROM FREIGHT FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS THE BILL WOULD PROHIBIT THE RETAIL SALE OF ALL FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS ADULTS WOULD STILL BE ABLE.

SENATE GLACIER COUPLE BRIEF COMMENTS FIRST TO THANK BY I JOIN -- AUTHORSHIP WITH CENTER HILL I THINK THE REASON THAT I THINK BOTH OF US -- OUT WE'RE SO CONCERNED ABOUT THE C. WE HEARD SO MUCH FEEDBACK FROM OUR DISTRICT -- I HAD -- A FEW WEEKS AGO -- TWENTY MIDDLE SCHOOL KIDS IN MY OFFICE AND I GENTLY SAID TO THEM HEY -- HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THIS THING CALLED VAPING -- AND THEY ALL LOOKED AT ME LIKE -- DAD KIND OF LIKE THING. AND HE SAID ABSOLUTELY THEY SAID -- EVERYBODY'S DOING IT HE SAYS IN AND AND THEIR MIDDLE SCHOOL KIDS THEY SAID THAT A BABE IN THE HALLWAYS THE VAPOR ON THE PLAYFIELD SAY EVEN VAPE IN THE CLASSROOM. AND IT WAS LIKE -- THIS IS A THIS IS A SERIOUS SERIOUS PROBLEM AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL TRIES TO ADDRESS -- AS SENATOR HILL SAID. YEAH THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE MARKETING RIGHT WATERMELON STRAWBERRY HE'D LIKE -- TO SMELL THE VAPING PRODUCTS WE CAN SEND OUT AROUND TO THE THE MEMBERS -- BUT THIS THIS FLAVOR -- GRANT PERMISSIONS THE CHAIR SAID TO HERE. WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE CHAIR AND LET ME JUST SAY IN CONCLUSION THAT -- EASY CIGARETTES THEY'RE INFECTING THE HEALTH OF OUR CHILDREN -- THE REJECTING THEM TO NICOTINE. THEY'RE PROVIDING A GATEWAY TO TOBACCO USE. AND THEY'RE ENGAGING THEM IN ILLEGAL CONDUCT AND WE HAVE TO ACT URGENTLY ON THIS MATTER IT IS REALLY OUT OF CONTROL THANK YOU SENATOR HILL. THANK YOU SENATOR GRAY SHIRT AND WE DO HAVE A NUMBER OF WITNESSES MISTER CHAIR AT THANK YOU FOR THE INTELLIGENCE OKAY THANK YOU SO WITNESSES SUPPORT I DON'T KNOW HOW THE PEOPLE TESTIFY YOU GOT SIX MINUTES TOGETHER. ALL RIGHT SO [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME OUT OF YOUR BUSY SCHEDULES TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE IMPORTANT ISSUE OF KIDS VAPING. MY NAME IS TAYLOR BARKER I AM FIFTEEN YEARS OLD I TEN FOOT HIGH SCHOOL SHASTA COUNTY. TODAY I AM HERE WITH ATHLETES AVE. SHARE WITH YOU WHAT IS HAPPENING IN YOUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. THE BEING HAS BECOME EXTREMELY POPULAR. ROUGHLY SIX OUT OF EVERY TEN SINCE I TALKED TO HAVE A BEFORE OR CURRENTLY VAPING NOW. SOME KIDS BRING THE BABY TO SCHOOL AND EVEN THE BATHROOMS WHICH HAS GOTTEN THE NICKNAME THE JEWEL ROOM. I HAVE A FRIEND WITH ASTHMA WHO CAN'T USE THE BATHROOMS AT SCHOOL BECAUSE THE VAPING CAUSES HER TO HAVE A HARD TIME BREATHING. IN A SHOCKING AS IT IS SOME KIDS EVEN DATE DURING CLASS. IT IS SO COMMON TODAY. NOW THAT IS A SOCIAL NORM AND IF YOU DON'T PARTICIPATE IN IT YOUR MADE FUN OF KEEP IN MIND THIS ISN'T JUST BURN OUTS AND PARTY YEARS. IT'S ALSO THE STAR FOOTBALL PLAYERS NAY P. STUDENTS. THE PROBABILITY THAT YOUR KIDS AND GRANDKIDS VAPE IS VERY HIGHLY. WHAT MAKES MATTERS WORSE AS MANY STUDENTS ARE BECOMING ADDICTED TO NICOTINE AND UNDERSTAND THE DANGERS? I'VE SEEN KIDS NOT EAT THEIR LUNCH AND USE THE LUNCH MONEY THAT THEIR PARENTS GAVE THEM TO BUY VAPE JUICE. IT'S GET TOO CAUGHT UP IN THE FRUITY TWENTY FLAVORS TO REALIZE THE DANGERS CHEMICALS THEY'RE PUTTING IN THEIR BODIES. ONLINE MARKETING HAS MADE IT EASIER THAN EVER FOR STUDENTS TO OBTAIN ACCESS THESE NICOTINE DEVICES WITHOUT THEIR PARENTS EVER KNOWING. I HAVE A CLEAN CUT SIXTEEN YEAR OLD FRIEND WHO ORDERS BABY PRODUCTS IN BULK ONLINE THEMSELVES INDUSTRIES THESE PRODUCTS TO OTHER STUDENTS. WITHOUT YOUR HELP I ONLY SEE MATTERS GETTING WORSE. I AM GENUINELY SCARED AND CONCERN FOR THE YOUTH AND GENERATIONS TO COME. PAPERS BUT THE DETECTIVE DANGEROUS AND FIGURATIVELY A POISON. WITH THAT BEING SAID I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT YOU CONSIDER WHAT CAN BE DONE TO PROTECT YOUR STUDENTS FROM THE GROWING THREAT OF VAPING. AND THE DANGEROUS HEALTH EFFECTS GREAT AS A RESULT. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR INDUSTRY ENGLISH COMMITTEE MEMBERS I THINK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB. THIRTY EIGHT MY NAME IS DOCTOR BONNIE HUBBARD FELL SURE I'M A PROFESSOR OF PEDIATRICS AND DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH IN THE DIVISION OF ADOLESCENT MEDICINE. AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY I'M A DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGIST WITH ADDITIONAL TRAINING IN ADOLESCENT AND YOUNG ADULT HEALTH I HAVE OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE RESEARCHING WHY YOUTH USED TOBACCO WITH E. CIGARETTES AT THE CORE OF MY CURRENT WORK. I'M ALSO THE FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STANFORD TOBACCO PREVENTION TOOL KIT. I'M HERE TO EXPRESS THREE MAIN CONCERNS ABOUT FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS. FIRST AS MENTIONED THERE ARE OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND FLAVORS AVAILABLE FOR E. CIGARETTES AND NUMEROUS FLAVORS IN OTHER TOBACCO PRODUCTS WHICH IS CHOOSE SMOKELESS HOOKAH CIGARS. THESE FLAVORS ATTRACT YOUNG AND NEW USERS SUCH AS THE RUIT AND CANDY FLAVORS BUT ALSO MEANT AND MENTHOL THAT YOU ARE USING A RECORD. NUMBERS IN FACT MANGLE IMAGE ARE THE MOST POPULAR USE FLAVORS ANGELS. 80% OF ADOLESCENT SITE FLAVORS IS A REASON FOR USE FLAVORS MASK THE HEART HARSH TASTE OF TOBACCO RESULTING IN A MORE PLEASANT SMELL AS YOU'RE SEEING. AND SMELLING NOW THAN THAT WOULD BE FOUND IT WITH TOBACCO Là. MùT TWO THREE PORT THAT THEY WOULD QUIT USING TOBACCO IT FLAVORS WERE NOT AVAILABLE. SECOND FLAVORS MASS THE RISKS THAT ARE INHERENT IN TOBACCO INCLUDING THE FACT THAT MANY E. CIGARETTES AND IN PARTICULAR THE NEWER POD BASED PRODUCTS LIKE JEWELS HAVE AS MUCH NICOTINE AND HIGHLY NICK CONCENTRATED NICOTINE. AS THAT WOULD BE FOUND IN ONE TO TWO PACKS OF CIGARETTES KIDS ARE ADDICTED TO THESE PRODUCTS AND THERE FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO GO ON TO USE CIGARETTES IF THEY START WITH ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES. LESLIE SENATORS WHO WILL LIKELY HERE TODAY ARGUMENTS THAT ADULTS NEED FLAVORS TO SUCCESSFULLY QUIT SMOKING CONVENTIONAL CIGARETTES HOWEVER THAT IT'S SIMPLY NOT BORNE OUT BY RESEARCH WELL TOLD ME LIKE FLAVORS ANY CIGARETTES THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO QUIT SMOKING CIGARETTES WITHOUT THEM. THE EVIDENCE IS CLEAR THE FLAVORS ATTRACT KIDS EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH LEVELS OF NICOTINE GET AND KEEP KIDS ADDICTED AND ADULTS DON'T NEED THESE FLAVORS TO QUIT SMOKING I THEREFORE URGE YOU TO PASS SB THIRTY EIGHT TO PROTECT. THE HEALTH OF OUR CHILDREN. AFTERNOON I'M DOCTOR PHILIP GARDNER I WOULD IN THE CULTURE OF THE AFRICAN AMERICAN TOBACCO CONTROL LEADERSHIP COUNCIL. I ALSO WORK AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT TO BACK RELATED DISEASE RESEARCH PROGRAM WHICH I'VE DONE FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. LET ME MAKE ONE THING CLEAR IN THE FIRST PLACE THE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT THE SENATE CAN DO THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO. TO PROTECT OUR HEALTH IS TO GET RID OF FLAVORS AND TOBACCO. THE BOTTOM LINE IS YOU PUT FLAVORS IN THE BACK -- IT HELPS TO POISON TO GO DOWN EASIER THERE'S NO MISTAKE ABOUT THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE JEWEL EXPLOSION THAT EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT IN THE FIFTEEN THOUSAND FLAVORS. IT'S A FLAVOR EXPLOSION WE'VE BEEN AWARE OF THIS EXPLOSION FOR SOME TIME UNFORTUNATELY IT'S BEEN CONCENTRATED AROUND MENTAL WE KNOW THAT MENTAL HAS AN ANESTHETIC EFFECT ALLOWS DEEPER INHALATION. THE DEEPER YOU INHALE THE MORE TOXINS AND NICOTINE YOU TAKE IN THE MORE NEGATIVE AND TALKS AND YOU TAKE IN THE GREATER THE ADDICTION THE GREATER THE ADDICTION IT'S HARDER TO QUIT WE'VE KNOWN THIS FOR YEARS. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE OF THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY -- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A PREDATORY SITUATION WHEN THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY WHERE THEY'VE MARKETED THESE PRODUCTS THERE'S GREATER ADVERTISEMENTS GREATER PROMOTIONS AND THE THING THAT IS MOST DISGUSTING IS THAT. MENTHOL CIGARETTES ARE CHEAPER IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY COMPARED TO OTHER COMMUNITIES. LET'S BE CLEAR THAT AFRICAN pFROM TOBACCO RELATED DISEASE THAT INCLUDES HEART ATTACKS STROKES AND LUNG CANCER. BUT IT'S NOT JUST BLACK FOLKS IN THIS NOT JUST KIDS WERE TALKING ABOUT ADULTS HERE THE MAJORITY OF WOMEN WHO SMOKE SMOKE MENTHOL CIGARETTES. THE MAJORITY OF THE LGBT COMMUNITY WE HAVE THE TIME. LET ME LET ME STOP I WANT TO TAKE MY FRIENDS FOR A A TIME TO SPEAK. I WANT TO CALIFORNIA LEGISLATOR TO TAKE THE LEAD ON THIS I THINK IT'S GOOD NUMBER OF CITIES OF ALREADY DONE THIS OF THE AFRICAN AMERICAN TOBACCO CONTROL LEADERSHIP COUNCIL HAS WORKED WITH THE CITY'S WE'D LIKE TO WORK WITH THE STATE ON THIS.

RESET [inaudible] DELETE [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] THAT. AT THE HEAD AGAIN. WHAT'S RED WITH A AGO CAN YOU HEAR ME OK. UGH THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE -- MY NAME IS CHASE RIGBY I GREW UP IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT RECENTLY MORE RECENTLY RELOCATED TO THE SACRAMENTO AREA. FOR CAREER PURPOSES. I WORK FOR A MAJOR CHOCOLATE COMPANY CONDUCTING RETAIL SALES. I AM A REGISTERED VOTER AND I BELIEVE IN THE POWER OF OUR GOVERNMENT AND WHAT YOU GUYS ARE -- TO ME TODAY. THIS IS PARTIALLY WHY I FELT MY PRESENCE HERE TODAY WAS NECESSARY -- AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN I WAS INTRODUCED TO TOBACCO THROUGH A FRIEND WHICH DEVELOPED INTO A VERY DEEP PROTECTION. OF THIS WAS A HUGE SURPRISE TO MY FAMILY AS I COME FROM A LINE OF EDUCATORS WHO HAVE NEVER SMOKED CIGARETTES. MY ADDICTION LASTED A TOTAL OF NINE YEARS AS I WAS UNABLE TO QUIT CIGARETTES REGARDLESS OF MY MANY ATTEMPTS -- WHEN JULES INTRODUCED AS A NEW PRODUCT I WAS IMMEDIATELY ABLE TO KICK THE DISGUSTING HABIT? I'VE NOT HAD A SINGLE CIGARETTES SINCE THE INCEPTION OF TOOL -- WHEN I WAS A SMOKER I WAS NOT CAPABLE BEING HEALTHY NOR WAS I ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY -- TIME I LOST MY SENSE OF SMELL -- MY ABILITY TO TASTE FOODS DIMINISHED AND TO MY AMAZEMENT I HAVE FULLY RECOVERED FROM THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS HE CAUSED BY CIGARETTES IN MY OPINION -- WHEN OF? I BEGIN USING THIS PRODUCT I WAS VERY INTERESTED IN THE NON TOBACCO FLAVORS AS I WAS TRULY TRYING TO DISTANCE MYSELF FROM BEING ASSOCIATED WITH TOBACCO. THESE FLAVORED PRODUCTS WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN MY ABILITY TO STOP SMOKING CIGARETTES I CAN ONLY HOPE THAT FLAVORS CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE FOR ADULT SMOKERS SUCH AS MYSELF WHO DOES WHO HAVE DECIDED TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP INCLUDING TOBACCO -- I WOULD LIKE IT TO BE KNOWN HOW IMPORTANT TOOL HAS BEEN IN THE HORRIBLE PROCESS. OF QUITTING CIGARETTES I WAS A TEENAGER WHEN I BEGAN SMOKING AND I CAN COME CONFIDENTLY TELL YOU THAT IT WAS THE WORST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE -- I CAN ALSO CONFIRM WE SHARE WITH YOU THAT MY WIFE WHOM I'VE BEEN WITH SINCE THE AGE OF SIX SEVENTEEN WOULD NOT ACCEPT MY MARRIAGE PROPOSAL AND TELLER WAS CIGARETTE FREE. I WAS ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS SOLELY BECAUSE OF MY TRANSITION TO JEWEL. THIS PRODUCT HAS BEEN THE ONLY SOLUTION AND MY MISSION TO STOP SMOKING. THESE FLAVORS WERE AND MAJOR PART OF MY ABILITY TO PERMANENTLY QUIT SMOKING. AND ULTIMATELY I IMPLORED THE COMMITTEE TO VOTE NO ON PROPOSITION SB THIRTY EIGHT AND FIND AN ALTERNATIVE WAY TO RESTRICT USAGE BY UNDERAGE PEOPLE WHILE ALLOWING ADULT SMOKERS ACCESS TO A PRODUCT THAT CAN. AND WILL ACTUALLY HELP THEM QUIT CIGARETTES THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU MEMBERS COMMITTEE MY NAME'S KEN ELLIE AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE VAPOR TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION AND ITS SIX HUNDRED MEMBERS OF MANUFACTURERS IMPORTERS WHOLESALERS AND REAILERS. I WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE POINTS ABOUT THIS THIS CATEGORY PRODUCTS AND FOR SMALL THAT THEY ARE NOT IN FACT TOBACCO IN THE ONLY COMMON DENOMINATOR BETWEEN THESE PRODUCTS AND TOBACCO IS NICOTINE. THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS IS DETERMINED THAT THAT THESE PRODUCTS ARE 95% SAFER THAN TRADITIONAL CIGARETTES IN PUBLIC HEALTH ENGLAND HAS DETERMINED THAT THEY'RE USEFUL TOOL. IN HELPING TO PICK PEOPLE QUIT TO WRESTLE CIGARETTES IN FACT AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY SAID THAT USING THE CURRENT GENERATION OF THE CIGARETTES IS LESS HARMFUL THAN -- SMOKING CIGARETTES. THE FLAVORS BAN WOULD S. ESSENTIALLY DECIMATE THIS THIS CATEGORY AND I WOULD SAY THAT -- THAT IN A JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTEEN STUDY THE TOBACCO CONTROL -- FOUND THAT BETWEEN ONE POINT SIX MILLION AND SIX POINT SIX MILLION AMERICANS WILL DIE AS A RESULT OF CIGARETTE SMOKING AND THESE ARE -- PRODUCTS THAT CAN HELP PEOPLE PREVENT THOSE DEBTS. AB POINT ON APRIL TWENTY EIGHTEEN STUDY BY J. C. CHEN THAT FOUND THAT. SMOKERS WHO USE VAPOR PRODUCTS WERE MORE LIKELY TO ROUTE TO REDUCE OR SMOKING OR QUIT THEIR SMOKING WITH ONE OR MORE NON TOBACCO OR NON MENTHOL FLAVORED PRODUCTS. THE FINAL POINT THAT I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT THERE IS NO CHARACTERIZING FLAVOR TO THESE PRODUCTS THEY TASTE LIKE NOTHING SO EVEN TOBACCO IS A FLAVOR ADDED TO THESE PRODUCTS. SO. ADDING FLAVORS IS NOT MASKING A TOBACCO FLAVORED ADDING FLAVOR TO THE PRODUCT. WE WOULD URGE YOU TO OPPOSE THIS BILL AND WE'D LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU ON A MEANINGFUL AND PROVEN -- WAYS TO CURB THE YOUTH USAGE PROGRAM WHAT FOOTWEAR CONCERNED ABOUT AS WELL THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JAMES TRACK HERE ON BEHALF OF JEWEL LABS -- I'M PLEASED TO INTRODUCE ACTUALLY GOLD WHO IS -- JEWELS CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER WHO'S HERE TO PROVIDE A SHORT STATEMENT BUT ALSO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE PRODUCT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. TWO LABS AGREES WITH THE INTENTION OF SENATE BILL THIRTY EIGHT TO RESTRICT USE ACCESS FROM VAPOR PRODUCTS. HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROPOSED BAN ON ALL FLAVORED VAPOR PRODUCTS AT RETAIL WILL NOT EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. WELL HARMING THE OVER THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO SMOKE AND OTHERWISE MIGHT SWITCH TO VAPOR PRODUCTS. FORTY THOUSAND OF WHOM WILL DIE EACH YEAR OF SMOKING RELATED DISEASES. SMOKERS NEED A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE TO DRIVE THEM FROM CIGARETTE USE. PAPER PRODUCTS CAN FILL THAT VOID AND FLAVORS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE. WELL ADDITIONAL LONG TERM RESEARCH IS NEEDED THE GROWING SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS ON PAPER PRODUCTS IS THAT THEY ARE A LESS HALL HARMFUL ALTERNATIVE COMPARED TO COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTES. IN OUR STUDIES OF THOUSANDS OF JEWEL USERS PEOPLE WHO EXCLUSIVELY USE NON TOBACCO FLAVORS. WERE 30% MORE LIKELY TO SWITCH THAN THOSE WHO USE TOBACCO FLAVORS. MINT AND MANGO CONSISTENTLY HAVE THE HIGHEST WHICH RATES AMONG ADULT SMOKERS IN OUR STUDIES. BUT LET US BE CLEAR. AND I SAY THIS AS A MOTHER WE DON'T WANT ANY NON NICOTINE USER TO USE OUR PRODUCTS ESPECIALLY USE. WE SUPPORT SUBSTANTIAL CATEGORY WIDE ACTIONS TO RESTRICT YOUTH ACCESS. SUCH AS IMPOSING ENHANCED AGE VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS FOR RETAIL AND ONLINE SALES. AND BANNING FLAVORS AND PACKAGING THAT ARE DIRECTLY TARGETED AT A YOUNGER AUDIENCE SUCH AS THOSE THAT MIMIC YOUTH APPEALING CANDIES. DESSERTS OR DRINKS HOWEVER WE FEEL IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE NEW LEGISLATION TO PROTECT CHILDREN WE ALSO PRESERVE ACCESS FOR THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIA SMOKERS. WHO COULD POTENTIALLY BENEFIT BY SWITCHING FROM COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTES? WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORK CONTINUING OUR WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN THE COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS. TO SUCCESSFULLY ADDRESS THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- I WAS TOLD THREE WITNESSES AND TIME IS UP SO -- IF YOU WISH. TO WELL SO SO WE HAVE WE ALLOW PEOPLE TO GIVE PUBLIC CUTS STATE THEIR POSITION AND PUBLIC COMMENT WE DID WE ALLOW EACH SIDE SIX MINUTES. AND THOUGH WE ARE SO. SO. SO.

OKAY SEE NO OTHER PEOPLE THE MICROPHONE [inaudible] OKAY. THURSTON FIRST THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- I'D LIKE US TO QUESTIONS TO THE CHILDREN -- ONE IS COULD CAN YOU DESCRIBE YOUR FLAVORED PRODUCTS AND TELL US WHY YOU BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE IMPORTANT TO ADULT SMOKERS AND THE AND THE DATA YOU HAVE TO SUPPORT THAT NUMBER [inaudible] ONE NUMBER. TWO HI I'VE NEVER TRUSTED THE TOBACCO COMPANIES. THE MAN SHOWN TO LIE TO CONGRESS I BELIEVE THEY SELL CIGARETTES KNOWING THAT THEY CAUSE MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. CAN I HAVE A CONCERN THAT 30% OF YOUR COMPANY'S BEEN BOUGHT UP BY BIG TOBACCO. HOW CAN WE BE ASSURED THE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SUCCUMB TO BIG TOBACCO'S -- YEARNING TO MAKE MONEY OVER THE LIVELIHOOD OF CHILDREN THAT ARE GETTING ADDICTED TO NICOTINE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTIONS -- SIR TO ANSWER THE FIRST QUESTION THE FLAVORS WE HAVE MEANT AND TOBACCO AND MENTHOL THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN RETAIL IN NOVEMBER. WE UNDERTOOK A LARGE ACTION PLAN TO TO BEGIN TO ADDRESS YOUTH USAGE WHICH INCLUDING PULLING THOSE OUT OF RETAIL AS WELL A COMPLETELY COMING OFF OF SOCIAL MEDIA OTHER THAN THE USE OF TWITTER. I'M HAVING ADDITIONAL ONLINE AGE VERIFICATION ADDITIONAL RETAIL CONTROLS SUPPORTING TWENTY ONE PLUS LEGISLATION WHICH IS OF COURSE ALREADY IN EFFECT HERE AS WELL AS TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS. WE HAVE MANGO CUCUMBER FRUIT AND CRAM THAT ARE CURRENTLY ONLY AVAILABLE ONLINE TO TWENTY ONE PLUS USERS -- AND I WAS TALKING EARLIER ABOUT OUR BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE PROGRAM WE HAVE OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND DREW USERS IN THAT PROGRAM OVERALL. I'M YESTERDAY ACTUALLY OUR SECOND S. SECOND PEER REVIEWED PUBLICATION WAS RELEASED IN THE HARM REDUCTION JOURNAL THAT SPECIFICALLY TALKS ABOUT THIS THE IMPORTANCE OF FLAVORS AND SWITCHING. THAT WE'VE SEEN AND THIS PARTICULAR SURVEY WAS ALMOST TEN THOUSAND ADULT USERS AND WE SAW IN THAT SURVEY THAT IF YOU IF THOSE SMOKERS WERE USING. SOLELY A NON TOBACCO FLAVOR THEY HAD A 30% INCREASE IN THEIR FULL SWITCHING RIGHT. WILL SWITCHING IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR HARM REDUCTION YOU GET THE PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFIT WHEN YOU'RE NOT EVEN TAKING A PUFF OF A CIGARETTE. SO WE HAVE SEEN IN OUR DATA AND WE HEAR ANECDOTALLY WITH WITH SMOKERS HAVE SWITCHED ALL THE TIME. THAT FLAVORS ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO THEIR SWITCHING I KNOW IT'S NOT INTUITIVE. I HAVE A MENTOR MYSELF WHO WAS A LONG TIME SMOKER HE SENT ME AN EMAIL AND JEN END OF JANUARY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN SAYING HUGHES MANGO. HE SAID IT WAS THIRTY DAYS SINCE YOU HAVE A CIGARETTE AND IT WAS THE LONGEST YOU'VE GONE WITHOUT A CIGARETTE SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX TO THIS DAY HE STILL HAD A CIGARETTE. AND FOR THOSE SMOKERS YOU'VE HEARD FROM IN THE ROOM IT'S AN INCREDIBLY EMPOWERING THING FOR THEM. AND WE ALSO THINK VERY IMPORTANT FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE -- WITH RESPECT TO YOUR SECOND QUESTION IS A GREAT QUESTION -- I PERSONALLY STRUGGLED WITH IT -- AND WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT -- THAT OSHA HAS A 35% INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY AFTER THEY GET THROUGH ANTI TRUST APPROVALS THEY'LL HAVE THREE SEATS ON THE BOARD THERE WILL NEVER HAVE A CONTROLLING VOTE ON THE BOARD. AND THERE ARE ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS IN THE CONTRACT TO PREVENT THEM FROM THAT CONTROL POSITION. THE REASON THAT WE UNDERTOOK THIS INVESTMENT WAS IN ORDER TO ACCESS TO THEIR LIST OF SEVENTEEN MILLION -- AGE VERIFIED ADULT SMOKERS TO WHOM WE CAN DIRECTLY MARKET -- WE WILL BE PUTTING INSERTS INTO PACKS OF MARLBOROS SAYING NEXT TIME TRY JEWEL AND MAKE THE SWITCH -- AN INCREASE IN PROVED -- POSITIONING IN STORES AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT RETAIL IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE SMOKERS GO GET THEIR CIGARETTES AT RETAIL. AND IF WE WANT THEM TO SWITCH TO A LESS HARMFUL ALTERNATIVE IT NEEDS TO BE RIGHT THERE NEXT TO IT. SO THOSE ARE THE REASONS WE UNDERTOOK I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN HAPPY TO TALK FURTHER ABOUT IT AS WELL -- BUT WE'VE THOUGHT VERY HARD ABOUT IT IN THE CONTRACT THANK YOU -- ACTUALLY BEFORE -- BEFORE YOU MOVE ON TO FURTHER QUESTIONS ACTUALLY SIDE IF YOU WISH TO HAVE YOUR WITNESSES AT THE TABLE THEY WANT ACCESS TO HELP ANSWER QUESTIONS -- THEY CAN. THE ONES WHO TESTIFIED WE CAN GET AROUND JUST. THANK YOU OKAY YEAH ALL RIGHT -- CENTER MONEY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. ONE THINK THE AUTHORS FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD ALL THE WITNESSES FOR BEING HERE. MY FIRST QUESTION IS FOR THE GENTLEMAN WHO. SWITCHED FROM COMBUSTIBLE TOBACCO TO VAPING ARE YOU STILL USING THE PRODUCTS. YES SIR IN ARE THE PRODUCTS THAT YOU USED TO THEY CONTAIN NICOTINE. YES SIR. IS IT FAIR TO SAY YOU'RE ADDICTED TO NICOTINE. YES AND DO YOU KNOW OF ANY HEALTH BENEFITS TO NICOTINE ABSOLUTELY NOT. I WILL MENTION THAT -- AS SOON AS TOOL CAME OUT WITH A LOWER NICOTINE STRENGTH I IMMEDIATELY TRANSITION TO THAT AND HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS SINCE THEN IT'S BEEN EASY. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO LESSEN THE NICOTINE AMOUNT AS TIME GOES ON BUT IT WAS NOT HARD FOR ME TO SWITCH TO THE LOWER NICOTINE LEVEL IN Q. IN YOUR WHERE THAT SOME OF THE JEWEL PRODUCTS THAT ARE BEING USED BY CHILDREN -- MIDDLE SCHOOL KIDS HAVE A HIGHER CONCENTRATION OF NICOTINE THAN CIGARETTE PRODUCTS THAN CIGARETTES -- YES I THINK THAT'S A LITTLE HARD. TO TO THE STATE POLICE YES ON BECAUSE IF YOU TAKE ONE INDIVIDUAL -- AND THAT'S YOUR ONLY HIT ALL DAY THAT NO THAT'S NOT A STRONGER MAN A NICOTINE THAN SMOKING A CIGARETTE. IN HOW MANY YOUNG PEOPLE DO YOU THINK TAKE. ONE HIT A DAY I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW BUT I CAN REFLECT MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WHEN I BEGAN SMOKING I DIDN'T JUST FULLY GO INTO SMOKING TWENTY CIGARETTES A DAY. BUT BY THE END OF MY HABIT I WAS SMOKING THIRTY PLUS CIGARETTES A DAY -- BUT AT THE BEGINNING IT WAS. SOMETHING LIKE ONE TO FIVE CIGARETTES A DAY SO I WOULDN'T I WOULDN'T SAY IT WAS UNREASONABLE TO SAY THAT. JEWEL SMOKERS AS DOES TEENAGERS SMOKE -- AND THE DATE OF A FAIR AMOUNT LESS THAN ADULTS SMOKE BUT NEIGHBORS. YOU DO BELIEVE NICOTINE TO BE AN ADDICTIVE PRODUCT ABSOLUTELY. SENT MY CHILDREN NEED TO VAPE WHEN THEY'RE IN SCHOOL -- I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S WHY THEY THEY FEEL THE NEED TO BE PUT IN SCHOOL OR COULD BE PEER PRESSURE EXCEPT -- FOR WHEN I WAS STILL GOING TO SCHOOL IT IT WAS RIGHT IN THE TRANSITION PERIOD OF WHERE. PEOPLE WERE STILL KIND OF COOL IF YOU SMOKE CIGARETTES AND BY KIND OF BY THE END OF MY HIGH SCHOOL LIFE IT WAS NOT COOL AT ALL SIX HUNDRED SO. I APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY IN FOR THE DOCTOR FROM UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. MY QUESTION FOR YOU SIR IS IF YOU KNOW -- ARE MORE SMOKERS BENEFITING THROUGH VAPING TO STOP THEIR THEIR ADDICTION. TO TOBACCO PRODUCTS. OR OR MORE YOUNG PEOPLE USING THEIR PRODUCTS AND BECOMING ADDICTED TO NICOTINE. WELL I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT BOTH SIDES OF THIS -- NUMBER ONE THERE ARE NUMEROUS STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT PEOPLE THAT USE ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES TRANSITION TO REGULAR CIGARETTES WE HAVE A LOT OF STUDIES ON THAT WE WILL SHARE WITH YOU. THAT MATERIAL SECONDLY AND UNFORTUNATELY THE SECOND PART OF YOUR QUESTION WE KNOW THAT THE I MEAN THE STATISTICS ARE OVERWHELMING THAT 78% INCREASE AND NICOTINE USE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS BY CHILDREN CHILDREN FOLKS. TWELVE TO SEVENTEEN IS WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST HERE. LET ME JUST SAY -- THE THE IDEA THAT. THE ROYAL -- MEDICAL ASSOCIATION OF ENGLAND SUGGESTION THAT THE CIGARETTES ARE 95%. OF LESS -- HARMFUL THAN REGULAR CIGARETTES MANY OF US DISAGREE WITH AND THERE'S MANY MANY PAPERS WRITTEN ABOUT THAT. MANY PAPERS WRITTEN ABOUT THAT SO I THINK YOU TWO QUESTIONS ARE RIGHT PEOPLE -- WHO START USING THE CIGARETTES ARE TRANSITION TO TO THE CIGARETTES THE MATURE? THE STUDY SHOWED THAT THE MAJORITY OF THEM GO BACK TO REGULAR CIGARETTES -- IN FACT I THINK THE DATA SHOWS PRETTY CONCRETE LEAVE THAT WHAT WE BASICALLY HAVE FOR TOOL USERS IN THE UNITED STATES AND THAT'S THE MAJORITY OF WHAT PEOPLE DO -- AND AND AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT HOW I WOULD ANSWER YOUR QUESTION THANK YOU IN -- FOLLOW UP QUESTION. IN YOUR TESTIMONY TALKED ABOUT -- THE TARGETING OF CERTAIN COMMUNITIES IS THIS DONE IN TERMS OF ADVERTISING OF PRODUCTS IN. TARGETED COMMUNITIES. I WOULD I WOULD EVEN TAKE IT A STEP FURTHE -- THERE'S A WHOLE HISTORY OF THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY TARGETING OF MINORITY COMMUNITIES AND SPECIALLY THE BLACK COMMUNITY AND GETTING THEM FLAVOR PRODUCTS WHAT'S BEEN MOST INTERESTING TO ME ABOUT IS THE PIVOT JEWELS TAKEN. THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN WHAT IT WANTS TO BE A PARTNER WITH THE BLACK COMMUNITY AND MEETING WITH DIFFERENT PLAY GROUPS AND HOW THEY'RE GOING TO HELP SAVE THE TOBACCO EPIDEMIC IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY. AND IT'S THE SAME PLAY BOOK THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY IS USED FOR THE LAST -- UNFORTUNATELY THE LAST SIXTY OR SEVENTY YEARS WITH OUR COMMUNITY. LOOK THERE ARE STUDIES AND I MENTIONED IT AND WE'VE BEEN WE SHOULD WE SHOULD ALL BE AWARE OF IT. THERE ARE MORE PROMOTIONS FOR TOBACCO PRODUCTS IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY THERE ARE MORE -- DISCOUNTS. AND THE PRODUCTS ARE CHEAPER -- WE HAVE STUDIES BOTH COMING OUT OF MASSACHUSETTS WHO STUDIES COMING OUT OF CALIFORNIAN FACTS AND IT IS KNOWN FUNDED AT STANFORD OF LOOKING AT THIS PHENOMENA. THE IDEA OF PUTTING UP A COUPON FOR JUL IN A MARLBORO CIGARETTE IS THE PROOF OF THE TOOL USE AND AND AND IN INCREASING THE ADDICTION OF PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES. OF WHILE IT MAY BE TRUE THAT THAT THE ONLY THREE MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF TOOL CIGARETTES ON ON OF THE PHILIP MORRIS ON JUL CIGARETTES -- I THINK THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT THE MARKETING OF THESE PRODUCTS NOW HAS MUCH MORE BACKING THEIR OF THEIR FIGHT WITH THE FDA GETS MUCH MORE DEVELOPED -- I THINK WE WE WE HAVE A CHANCE TO I MEAN I WOULD SAY THE LAST THING I SAID AT THE OPENING OF THE ONE THING THAT FOLKS COULD DO IN THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE THAT OTHER THAN ANYTHING ELSE. IF YOU TAKE FLAVORS OUT OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS IT WOULD IMPROVE THE PUBLIC HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA STRAIGHT UP. THANK YOU SIR. STRAIGHT UP. I'D I REDUCE SO ACTUALLY YES I AM. YEAH IT'S AGAIN -- WE TREAT EVERYONE THE SAME. NO OUTBURSTS SEVEN VERY INDICATED EVEN TO PREVIOUS GROUPS THE SO IF WE CAN PLEASE MAINTAINER DECORUM HERE WOULD BE APPRECIATED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- YET IS THE PRACTICE TO TREAT ALL VIEW POINTS WITH RESPECT IN THIS BUILDING. SO I APPRECIATE THAT MISTER CHAIR -- IN FOR THE AUTHOR SOMEONE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. THE DATA THAT SHOWS YOUTH ARE ALSO ABLE TO ACQUIRE THESE OVER THE INTERNET -- I BELIEVE YOU HAVE ANOTHER BILL THAT'S GOING TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE THE NEXT BILL YES. SB THIRTY NINE WHAT WILL ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. SO THAT IS PART OF YOUR OVERALL. STRATEGY OF ON THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. MIGHT I RESPECT ON TO TO WE GIVE THOSE YOU COULDN'T ACTUALLY IF YOU'RE ASKED THE QUESTION. THEN YOU MAY RESPOND SO IT'S UP TO THE SENATOR FOR NOW QUESTION ANSWER PERIOD CENTER LEYVA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU GENTLEMEN -- SENATORS AND I'M HAPPY TO BE A CO AUTHOR ON BOTH OF YOUR BILLS. AND WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT NICOTINE AND HOW ADDICTIVE IT IS SO I JUST LOOKED IT UP ON WIKIPEDIA SO WE COULD. HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT WIKIPEDIA SAYS A NICOTINE IS HIGHLY ADDICTIVE IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMONLY ABUSED. DRUGS SO I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE LEAVING OUT OF THIS EQUATION NICOTINE IS A DRUG. IT ALSO SAYS THAT NICOTINE INDUCES BOTH BEHAVIORAL STIMULATION AND ANXIETY. NICOTINE ADDICTION INVOLVES DRUG REINFORCE BEHAVIOR COMPULSIVE USE AND RELAPSE FOLLOWING ABSTINENCE. IT GOES ON AND ON BUT I THINK YOU PROBABLY GET MY POINT. MY FRUSTRATION AS SOMEONE WHO GREW UP DURING A TIME WHEN CIGARETTES WERE POPULAR AND VERY GLAD THAT I NEVER STARTED. IS WE'VE SEEN A DECREASE IN TOBACCO USE AND NOW WE SEE A RISE IN VAPING THIS IS JUST A GREAT WAY FOR THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY TO FIND A NEW REVENUE STREAM. AND I KNOW JEWEL WE MET YOU CAME TO MY OFFICE YESTERDAY. AND I THINK YOU GUYS SEE YOURSELVES AS THE GOOD PLAYERS IN A BAD INDUSTRY BUT I'M GONNA HIGHLIGHT BAD INDUSTRY IF WE DON'T HAVE THE FLAVORS THEN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO MAKE ANOTHER CHOICE AND IF THEY WANNA VAPE GREAT BUT QUITE DOESN'T TASTE AS GOOD IT'S PROBABLY NOT AS MUCH. FUN IT'S PROBABLY NOT COOL. SO WE REALLY WANT TO DO SOMETHING FOR THE GOOD OF SOCIETY LET'S GET PEOPLE ON ADDICTED IF YOU'RE NOT ADDICTED TO TOBACCO BUT YOU'RE ADDICTED TO NICOTINE. WHAT'S THE STEP FORWARD HERE I I JUST I JUST REALLY DON'T SEE IT I APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS YOUR JOB AND THIS IS WHAT YOU DO AND APPARENTLY IT'S WHAT YOU FEEL PASSIONATE ABOUT -- BUT I JUST I JUST DON'T SEE IT SO -- THANK YOU AGAIN THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME BE A CO AUTHOR I LOOK FORWARD TO VOTING I ON THE BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR GROWTH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND YOU KNOW THANK YOU I'D LIKE TO THINK CENTER HILL FOR ALLOWING ME TO MEET WITH HIM REGARDING MY CONCERNS ABOUT THE AT THE BUSINESS ASPECT OF THIS PARTICULAR -- DISCUSSION THAT WE'RE HAVING TODAY AND SO I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME ON THAT -- I DO HAVE A A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS -- ONE I WANT TO START OUT IT COULD BE MY MISS MY UNDERSTANDING I IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I'M CORRECT SO I'M JUST GOING TO ASK. EXISTING LAW MAKES IT A CRIME PUNISHABLE BY A FINE OF SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS OR THIRTY HOURS A WEEK IF COMMUNITY SERVICE TO BE IN POSSESSION. OR PURCHASE RECEIVER POSSESSION OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS -- MEANING THIS PARTICULAR PRODUCT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY FOR MINORS. IS THAT LOST ELIMINATION OF A PRODUCT IS ACTION AT SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS AND THIRTY HOURS OF COMMUNITY SERVICE NOT AWARE OF THAT AT ALL I DON'T BELIEVE THERE IS A PENALTY FOR POSSESSION OF THE SOMEBODY ANSWER DOT PRODUCT THERE IS A FINE OF SEVENTY DOLLARS AND THE EXISTING PENALTIES. ENTERS ITS STRUCTURE OF THE STATE ACTON AND WHICH CURRENTLY IN PLACE WE'RE NOT. TOUCHING THAT ARE CHANGING THAT SO DID WE REPEAL THAT CAN SOMEBODY ANSWER THAT. WE'RE NOT REPEALING THAT NO BUT DID WEEK BECAUSE IT WAS EXISTING LOT ONE TIME BECAUSE I'M READING IT RIGHT HERE IT SAYS EXISTING LAW MAKES IT A CRIME PUNISHABLE. BY A FINE OF SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS OR THIRTY HOURS OF COMMUNITYSERVICE WORK FOR A PERSON UNDER THE EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE. IN ORDER TO PURCHASE RECEIVE OR BE IN POSSESSION OF THESE PRODUCTS SO IS IS THAT LAS STILL EXIST. CHANGE THE THE AGE FOR SMOKING TO TWENTY ONE THAT WAS REPEALED -- IT WAS OKAY SO WE DID REPEAL THAT SO NOTE STUDENT -- AND AGE MINOR CAN BE PUNISHED FOR BEING IN POSSESSION OF OKAY SO I DO HAVE AN AND WEBER WANTS TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS I'M OPEN TO IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE YOU SIR AND I'M NOT TRYING TO PIN YOU DOWN. WE WE WILL AS IT CURRENTLY LEGAL WILL DIRECT QUESTIONS TO THE AUTHORS ORDER. OKAY IS THERE HE IS IF YOU YOU KNOW IF YOU WISH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND IS IT CURRENTLY LGAL TO SELL FLAVORED MARIJUANA PRODUCTS SINCE IN CALIFORNIA [inaudible] YES. DOES THIS BILL CONTINUE TO ALLOW THE SALE OF FLAVORED MARIJUANA. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE BILL TO SELL FLAVORED MARIJUANA NOTE SO IS IT CURRENTLY LEGAL TO SELL FLAVORED MARIJUANA PRODUCTS. IN CALIFORNIA. NO. CURRENT CURRENT. LAW. EXCUSE ME AGAIN. ABOUT HIS ANIMALS AND THAT'S I I WOULD ASK THAT PEOPLE PLEASE MAINTAIN DESERVED QUORUM IT'S THE CHAIR WITH THEIR IF. THERE'S SOME QUESTIONS WE HAVE STAFF -- CAN LOOK THAT UP YOU CAN GET FLAVORED TOBACCO FLAVORED MARIJUANA EDIBLES AND OTHER THINGS YES YOU CAN. DOES YOUR BILL HOW CAN YOU. BE HERE -- SIR IF YOU ARE NOT. ABLE TO FOLLOW THE RULES. WE MAY HAVE TO ASK YOU TO LEAVE BUT THANK YOU. I PREFER NOT TO DO THAT WITH THE TEARS INDULGENCE AWKWARD ASKING QUESTIONS. THAT. IS IT CURRENTLY -- FOR LEGAL TO SELL FLAVOR ALCOHOL IN CALIFORNIA. I WOULD THINK SO YES. SO I GUESS I ASK THOSE QUESTIONS AND THE REASON WHY I ASK THOSE QUESTIONS IS BECAUSE THERE ARE -- IT POLICIES THAT WE AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY PEOPLE IN THE PAST HAVE PUT IN PLACE TO LIMIT. THE ABILITY FOR MINORS UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY ONE TO BE ABLE TO NOT PURCHASE. OF THOSE PRODUCTS. THROUGH EDUCATION INCREASED ENFORCEMENT FINES PENALTIES THINGS LIKE THAT. I GUESS MY CURE US MY CURIOSITY IS IS THAT ALL OF THOSE THINGS MARIJUANA -- CIGARETTES THOSE KINDS OF THINGS EVER YOU KNOW ALCOHOL THOSE THINGS ARE ADDICTIVE AS WELL SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IS THAT. WHY IT ALL ALBION WHY NOT ALLOW INDUSTRY? TO ADDRESS THESE THESE ISSUES RECUR GUARDIAN MINERS LIKE WE HAVE ALL AND THEIR INDUSTRIES THAT WE DON'T WANT OUR CHILDREN TO HAVE ACCESS TO BUT STILL ALLOW ADULT ACCESS. HIS INDUSTRY IN RELATED TO NICOTINE ADDICTION AND TOBACCO AND CERTAINLY SINCE THE 35% OF THIS COMPANY IS NOW OWNED BY A TOBACCO COMPANY. THEY FAILED TO DO THAT. HISTORICALLY. WE CONTINUE TO MARKET THE THAT PRODUCT INTO THE HANDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE I DON'TSEE I'VE NOT PERSONALLY SEEN THAT WITH ALCOHOL. THE END WOULD NOT SEEN THE 78% INCREASE IN ONE YEAR FOR HIGH SCHOOL USE. OF E. CIGARETTES OR 48% INCREASE IN MIDDLE SCHOOL USE. OF THE CIGARETTES THIS IS AN EPIDEMIC THAT REQUIRES THIS ACTION TODAY I DON'T TRUST THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY I DON'T TRUST TOOL I DON'T TRUST THE MANUFACTURERS OF THIS PRODUCT. TO SAY THAT THEY'RE GOING. TO MANAGE IT THEMSELVES AND REGULATE THEMSELVES TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES AND TO KEEP THAT OUT OF THE HANDS OF CHILDREN. SO I GUESS I YOU KNOW. TO RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE ONLY BECAUSE YOU KNOW I DON'T I DON'T SEE THE MARIJUANA INDUSTRY DOING THE SAME THING I YOU KNOW THEY'RE PROVIDING -- FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS ARE FLAVORED PRODUCTS LABOR DUMMIES FLAVOR THINGS LIKE THAT THAT WOULD APPEAL TO KIDS. AND WE MANAGED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO REGULATE THAT INDUSTRY TO A POINT THAT DOESN'T ALLOW CHILD ACCESS. I GUESS -- THE IMPACT OF THIS BILL ONE BUSINESS WHIH WE TALKED ABOUT A BUSINESS -- YOU KNOW AS A BUSINESS OWNER -- AND AGAIN IT'S JUST A BIT IT'S A BUSINESS AS A BUSINESS OWNER THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT THAT'S MADE IN ORDER -- TO INTO YOU KNOW MARKET A PRODUCT -- ORDERED A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT ON EMPLOYEES AND AND INVESTMENT TO STEVEN STARTED BUSINESS IN THE STATE. SO I TO I KNOW THAT WE HAD SIGNIFICANT TESTIMONY FROM BUSINESS OWNERS HERE I KNOW THERE'S PROBABLY -- FORTY THREE SHOPS THAT ARE LICENSED TAX PAYING SMALL BUSINESS VAPE SHOPS YEAH I'M HERE IN SACRAMENTO ALONE IN. THE EIGHTEEN SUGGEST THAT THEY MIGHT LOSE 85% OF THEIR BUSINESS AND POSSIBLY SHUT DOWN -- AGAIN IS THERE ANY WAY THAT WE CAN RESTRICT THE USE OF UNDER AGE -- ACTIVITY IN THESE BILLS ARE THIS PRODUCT. WITHOUT AN ALL OUT BEYOND AND I'M JUST ASKING FOR CONSIDERATION IN THAT. BURGER AND I WILL IN INTERESTINGLY THE USE USE OF MARIJUANA MY UNDERSTANDING IS ACTUALLY DECLINING. SINCE THE LEGALIZATION OF RECREATIONAL USE OF MARIJUANA IN CALIFORNIA SO IT'S ACTUALLY GOING THE OTHER DIRECTION. EVEN WITH THE GUMMY BEARS AND SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS A BUSINESS OWNER I GUESS WHAT I HAVE TROUBLE. UNDERSTANDING AND I CAN SEE SOME IMPACT OF THAT BUT IF I WERE ADDICTED TO NICOTINE. AND I WALK INTO A RETAIL ESTABLISHMENT. ADDICTED TO NICOTINE. AND I WANNA FLAVORED NICOTINE PRODUCTS. THEY DON'T HAVE THE NICOTINE FIVE FLAVORED NICOTINE PRODUCT BUT I'M ADDICTED TO NICOTINE. I'M GONNA BUY WHATEVER PRODUCT THEY HAVE IT HAS NICOTINE AND SO THEY'RE GOING TO GET THE SALE. PEOPLE GONNA SPEND THE MONEY ON THE PRODUCT THAT MEETS THE NEED TO TO SUPPLY THEIR ADDICTION. THAT'S WHERE I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WILL LOSE THE MONEY THAT EVERYONE TALKS ABOUT OF THE BUSINESS THAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT. I'M ADDICTED TO NICOTINE. I NEED THAT FIX AND I'M GONNA GET IT WHATEVER IT COSTS. M. OKAY WHY IBM I DO THINK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR RESPONSE AND I DO A I DO THINK YOU VERY MUCH FOR MEETING WITH ME -- BASED ON WHAT YOU JUST SAID IT'S IT'S ILLEGAL THOUGH FOR THESE UNDER TWENTY ONE YEAR OLDS TO PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT WHETHER THEY'RE ADDICTED TO IT OR NOT I WAS REFERRING TO TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD OKAY. BILLS OR DOING THE DISHES I DON'T THINK THESE RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS EVER SELL TO MINORS. THEY MADE BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THEY DO INTENTIONALLY BUT THERE'S A TALKING ABOUT THE ADULT BUSINESSES THEY MAY LOSE BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THEY CAN NO LONGER SELL FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS. IF YOU WALK INTO THAT STORE YOU'RE GOING TO BUY EIGHT NICOTINE. SUPPLY PRODUCTS WHATEVER THAT IS TO METHAT HAVE IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR [inaudible] SENATE MITCHELL -- FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE MIDDLE SCHOOLERS AND HIGH SCHOOLERS IN THE HEARING ROOM TODAY BECAUSE YOU ALL HAVE ACTED WITH. GREAT DIPLOMA AND MATURITY MUCH MORE SO THAN SOME OF THE OTHER SO I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND CONGRATULATE YOU. I HAVE A QUESTION THROUGH THE CHAIR IF I MAY ADDRESS IT TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO ARE MAKING OUT TO BE A LONG TERM SMOKER. I'M CURIOUS. AS A FORMER TOBACCO SMOKER. ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT IF YOU COULD HAVE HAD ACCESS TO THE FLAVORS TO VAPING THAT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITION. I'M SUGGESTING THAT. WHEN THE SMOKERS QUIT CONSIDERING QUITTING SMOKING ANYTHING THAT? REALLY ASSOCIATE THEMSELVES WITH TOBACCO CIRCUITS HAVE FOR EXAMPLE CIGARS DIP PRODUCTS ANYTHING ASSOCIATED WITH TOBACCO -- ISN'T GOING TO HELP YOU QUIT SMOKING CIGARETTES SO THE SECOND THAT THIS BECAME A MAJOR PHENOMENON THE PEOPLE -- AND YOU START HERE OF THE OTHER FLAVOR CHOICES. IN YOUR MIND YOU CAN. IMMEDIATELY START TO ASSOCIATE THAT YOU'RE NOT SMOKING TOBACCO I'D ALSO LIKE TO ADD IN ON THAT POINT THAT NOT ALL NICOTINE IN PAY PRODUCTS COMES FROM TOBACCO -- THERE'S MANY THERE'S OTHER SOURCES THAT NICOTINE COMES FROM -- BUT YES I I I AM STATING THAT IT WAS EXTREMELY HELPFUL FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO BECAUSE AT THE SAME TIME THAT THERE WAS FOR FLAVORS THERE WAS ALSO TOBACCO. FLAVOR. THAT I COULD HAVE CHOSEN FROM BUT YOU OPTED NOT TO BECAUSE IN YOUR MIND YOU WERE TRANSITIONING AWAY FROM SMOKING SO THE FLAVOR GAVE YOU THE IMPRESSION THAT YOU WERE. NOT REALLY SMOKING CORRECT -- IT DEFINITELY DID IT DEFINITELY DID AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT MORE RECENTLY WHEN WHEN THE 3%. WHEN THE LOWER NICOTINE LEVELS CAME OUT THE -- THE THEM THE IMMEDIATE ENTRY. IMMEDIATE ONES THAT WERE AVAILABLE TO ME WE'RE BACK TO THE TOBACCO FLAVOR AND SO I ACTUALLY BOUGHT THAT AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT TOUGH MENTALLY. DEFINITELY BROUGHT ME BACK TO CIGARETTE SMOKING WHICH BY THE WAY I FIND DISGUSTING. ABSOLUTELY 1100% AND THAT WAS VERY HARD AND SO WHEN I HEARD THEM TALKING ABOUT -- THEY'LL GET THEY'LL GET ANYTHING THAT'S NOT TRUE THAT'S REALLY NOT TRUE I THINK. A LOT OF PAPERS WOULD GO AS FAR AS TRYING TO BUY THEIR OWN LITTLE FLAVOR. YOU KNOW AN EDIBLE GRADE LAVORS THAT THEY COULD ADD TO THEIR THEIR NICOTINE THIRD THEIR PAPER PRODUCTS AT THAT POINT -- IT IS VERY MUCH SO BUT THE FLAVORS FOR ME PERSONALLY WERE A MAJOR PART OF ME BEING ABLE TO DISASSOCIATE WITH TOBACCO. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER. Q. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. RIGHT. YES -- CENTER STONE -- I WANT TO JUST -- AND JUST MAKE A FEW CAN CONCLUDING COMMENTS ABOUT -- THE HEARING TODAY -- WITH REGARD TO MY TO MY COLLEAGUE -- TALKING ABOUT FLAVORED ALCOHOL AND FLAVORED -- CANNABIS -- THE DIFFERENCE IS [inaudible] THAT [inaudible] TOBACCO KILLS [inaudible] TOBACCO. HAS CARCINOGENS DUNDALK MY TRADITIONAL TOBACCO -- YOU CAN'T OVERDOSE BY INHALING MARIJUANA. WE HAVE INSTANCES WHERE CHILDREN OF EDEN EDIBLES AND HAVE. HAD FATAL. ACTIONS -- CERTAINLY IF YOU DRINK TOO MUCH ALCOHOL YOU CAN BECOME AN ALCOHOLIC AND YOU CAN DIE OF CIRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER. BUT I THINK THE DANGERS OF TOBACCO. THERE IS PLACES -- THE FLAVORED ISSUE IN IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CATEGORY [inaudible] SO. I AM A PHARMACIST. AND I HAVE I WORK HARD IN MY CAREER IN. INCREASING LAWS THAT ALLOW US TO HELP PEOPLE. GET OFF OF TOBACCO TO START TAKING TOBACCO. THE LAWS OF ALLOW US. TO BASICALLY RECOMMENDED PRESCRIBED. NICOTINE CESSATION PROGRAMS. BUT THIS ISSUE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IS VERY PERSONAL FOR ME. IT'S PERSONAL BECAUSE MY MOTHER CHARLENE. WHO HAD ME WHEN SHE WAS SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD? DIED AT FIFTY SEVEN YEARS OLD. FROM LUNG CANCER. AND I SPENT MANY NIGHTS WITH HER SHE DIED SIX MONTHS FROM THE DIAGNOSIS. AND **** STOP SMOKING FOR TEN YEARS. IN ONE OF THE MOST COMPELLING THINGS THAT SHE SAID TO ME WHEN SHE WAS DYING [inaudible] WAS THAT [inaudible] GOD. HAD ME HAVE YOU AT A YOUNG AGE. FOR A REASON. AND THAT WAS SO WE COULD SPEND A WHOLE LIFETIME TOGETHER. AND HOW SHE REGRETTED. YOU KNOW. THE POISONS. I'LL NEVER FORGET A DAY WHEN I WAS DRIVING INTO LOS ANGELES WE WERE A LOW INCOME FAMILY. DRIVING INTO LAW SAYING TO SEE MY GRANDPARENTS AND ON THE RADIO THE FRONT SEAT TO MY SISTER WAS IN THE FRONT SEAT IN A CAR SEAT AND I WAS IN THE BACK. THE NEWS FLASHES CAME OVER. NAT KING COLE'S. DIED. OF LUNG CANCER [inaudible] FROM SMOKING. AND I SAID TO MY MOM I SAID. MOM WHY ARE YOU SMOKING IT KILLS. HAD HE SAID. BECAUSE I HAVE SOMETHING CALLED AN ADDICTION. IT'S NOT THAT I WANT TO SMOKE. IT'S THAT I HAVE TO SMOKE. MY GRANDMOTHER VIRGINIA FRIEDMAN. I RAN OUT OF MONEY WHEN I WAS GOING TO UCICE I TRANSFERRED TO UCLA TO GO TO SCHOOL. I ASKED MY GRANDMOTHER CAN I COME LIVE WITH YOU. SHE SAID THAT I COULD A LITTLE FOR FIVE YEARS A YEAR UCLA FIVE FOUR YEARS THE U. S. C. SCHOOL PHARMACY. MY GRANDMOTHER WAS A SMOKER SHE SPOKE FOR OVER SEVENTY YEARS. AND HAD A HORRIFIC DEATH OF EMPHYSEMA. MY UNCLE TOM [inaudible] WHO IS? AN INCREDIBLE HUMAN BEING ACTUALLY. INTRODUCED ME AND TAUGHT ME ABOUT POLITICS HAVING BEEN A POLITICS HIMSELF. LIVES IN LOS ANGELES IN CHERRY HILLS AND SENATOR -- HOLLY MITCHELL'S DISTRICT. WHO CAN'T EVEN WALK FROM THE BED TO THE TOILET? BECAUSE OF HIS SMOKING HISTORY. AND HE'S MAX OUT AN OXYGEN. HE'S MAX OUT ON HIS DRUGS. AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE -- EIGHTY CLOSE IN TIME FOR HIM. AND I PRAY FOR HIS. HAS ABLE HIS ABILITY TO SOMEHOW OXYGENATE. I LOVE HIM VERY VERY MUCH SO [inaudible] MY FRIENDS. I UNDERSTAND THE BUSINESS ATTRIBUTES PEOPLE THAT HAVE EMBRACE THIS FLAVORING AND OF DEVELOP BUSINESSES. BUT I WOULD TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THAT WHEN MY MOTHER WAS SMOKING WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WE KNOW TODAY. BECAUSE WE WERE NEVER TOLD THE TRUTH BY MOMENT WAS NEVER TOLD THE TRUTH. THAT HER GENERATION WAS NEVER TOLD THE TRUTH. AND HOW MANY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DIED AND SUFFERED COULD YOU IMAGINE NOT BEING ABLE TO CATCH HER BREATH TO DIE [inaudible] SO. AS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND RIVERSIDE COUNTY I SAT ON A WONDERFUL ORGANIZATION THE MANY OF YOU ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH. THIS CALL FIRST. FIVE FIRST FIVE RECOGNIZES THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT INTERVENTION THAT YOU CAN HAVE IN A CHILD'S LIFE IS IN THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF THEIR LIFE. AND IT'S SUPPORTED BY TOBACCO TAXES. AND THE GOOD NEWS IS. THAT OVER THE YEARS WE'VE SEEN A DECLINE IN TOBACCO USE AND THE BAD NEWS FOR FIRST FIVE IS AT THE SCENE A DECLINE. AND THE REVENUE STREAMS. ALSO SERVING ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WILL LEAD ENTERTAINER BUDGET EVERY YEAR WE HAVE OPEN ENROLLMENT. IT WAS TOLD TO US IN DECEMBER SO I COUNTY WHICH IS THE FOURTH LARGEST COUNTY IN THE STATE OUR COST EVERY YEAR. TO TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE. BECAUSE OF TOBACCO RELATED ILLNESSES IT'S THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND NOW. WHEN WE THOUGHT WE WERE GETTING OUT OF THIS TOBACCO GENERATION AND WE'VE? GONE OVER THE HUMP. IN THE END LEADING PEOPLE TO GOOD HEALTHY LIVES. WE SEE THE STATISTICS THAT THESE AUTHORS ARE BROUGHT FORWARD 70% INCREASE. IN THE UTILIZATION -- IN THE PAST TWO YEARS 48% IS EVEN MORE DISTURBING IN MIDDLE SCHOOLS. AND TO ME IT'S IT'S VERY TRANSPARENT. THAT THESE TOBACCO COMPANIES INVESTING IN THESE VAPING COMPANIES HAVE ONE GOAL AND A ONE GOAL IS NOT. TO TRY TO GET PEOPLE TO STOP USING TRADITIONAL TOBACCO THEIR GOAL IS TO GET YOUNGSTERS. ADDICTED TO NICOTINE ONE OF THE MOST. A NEW ADDICTIVE PRODUCTS IN THE WORLD. EVEN AS ADDICTIVE AS HEROIN LADIES AND GENTLEMAN. THIS IS PURPOSEFUL. AND WHY ARE THEY DOING IT THEY'RE DOING IT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO MAKE MONEY. AND THAT'S WHY. I'VE CHOSEN NEVER TO TAKE ANY TOBACCO MONEY IN MY TENURE HERE IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND I'M GOING TO MAINTAIN THAT SO. I KNOW THIS IT IS A VERY POWERFUL ADDICTION. MY FELT FELLOW SENATORS. AND YOU THAT IF YOU HAVE A CHOICE. OF A BIG. VERSUS USING TRADITIONAL TOBACCO. THAT IS NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU THE TARS AND CARCINOGENS THAT ARE GONNA CAUSE CANCER -- IF YOU'RE AN INTELLIGENT PERSON. AND CAMPY THAN THE ADDICTION YOU'RE GOING TO USE THE UNFLAVORED PRODUCT. TO SATISFY YOUR NEED FOR NICOTINE. BUT MY CONCERN. AND THE DOCTOR CONFIRMED IT. IS THAT THESE PRODUCTS ARE A GATEWAY TO GETTING PEOPLE BACK ON TRADITIONAL TOBACCO. AND I DON'T WANT MORE MONEY GOING TO FIRST FIVE AGAIN AFTER YEARS OF EDUCATING PEOPLE ABOUT THE HAZARDS IN DANGERS LOOK AT THE WARNINGS THAT ARE ON A PACK OF CIGARETTES. IT CAN CAUSE DEATH. CAUSE OF DEATH YOU DON'T SEE IT ON MARIJUANA PACKAGING. YOU DON'T SEE IT ON BOTTLES OF ALCOHOL THOUGH IF THOSE ARE. CHRONICALLY MUSIC CERTAINLY CAN DIE. SO WHILE IT IS PROBABLY -- RARE FOR A REPUBLICAN. TO TAKE A STANCE AS I AM TAKING I'M VERY PROUD OF MY STANCE I STAND WITH THESE TWO COLLEAGUES I'M A CO AUTHOR WITH THESE. TWO TO CALL AUTHORS AND I WILL DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO EDUCATE OUR YOUTH ABOUT THE HAZARDS OF NICOTINE AND THE HAZARDS TOBACCO SMOKE AS LONG AS I LIVE IN THE MEMORY. OF MY MOTHER CHARLENE MARCH. NOW MOVE THE BILL.

AND FOR THE GREAT SUPPORT THAT YOU'VE GIVEN AND AND ATHLETES DON'T BABY IS. MAY I AM A WE'RE ALL WITH. THANK YOU. A THE CALLING TO THE THE OPPOSITION HAS MADE SEVERAL CLAIMS MANY CLAIMS THAT THEIR PRODUCTS HELP ADULT SMOKERS QUIT WE'VE HEARD THAT. OVER AND OVER AGAIN. WELL IF JUL OR ANY OTHER TOBACCO COMPANY WANTS TO HELP ADULTS QUIT SMOKING. pUNDER SB THIRTY EIGHT THEY STILL HAVE THE OPTION TO APPLY TO THE FEDERAL DRUG ADMINISTRATION TO AND GET THEIR PRODUCTS DESIGNATED AS A TOBACCO CESSATION. EIGHT OTHERS HAVE DONE THAT. AND THEIR PRODUCTS THAT HELP YOU AND THEY HAVE NICOTINE. IN THEM TO HELP THE BILL BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY WANT. THAT'S WHAT THEY TELL US BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY WANT. NO E. CIGARETTE HAS SUCH APPROVAL NOR HAVE ANY EVEN BEEN FETED AT ALL BY THE FDA. WELL I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION THE IMPACT FLAVOR TOBACCO IS HAVING ON OUR KIDS IS TRULY ASTONISHING. AND I JUST WANT. TO IF USED TO TO SEE IF WE HAVE A FRONT IN THE BEGINNING BUT 80% OF YOUNG PEOPLE. WHO HAVE EVER USED TOBACCO STARTED WITH THE FLAVORED PRODUCT 80% THE START OF THE FLAVORED PRODUCT? 74% OF YOUTH WHO USED JUL FLAVORED PODS. OBTAINED THE DEVICE FROM A PHYSICAL RETAIL LOCATION 74%. THIS IS THE ONE THAT I THINK IS MOST COMPELLING AND WAS FOR ME. BECAUSE THEY WE TALK ABOUT THOSE WHO HAVE MIGRATED IN A PROTECTED GOTTEN OFF OF TOBACCO CIGARETTES IN GOING TO E. CIGARETTES AND HOW GREAT THAT IS FOR THEM AND I APPLAUD THEM FOR THAT. BUT THIS. THE STATISTICS SHOW. THAT FOR EVERY ADULT WHO QUIT SMOKING USING E. CIGARETTES SHE ATE DALY TOBACCO USE THROUGH E. CIGARETTES. EIGHTY SO WHAT'S THE BALANCE IN THAT. IT ALSO E. CIGARETTE USERS ARE ATTACK AND 30%. MORE LIKELY TO SUFFER A STROKE. THOSE ARE THE STATISTICS COLLEAGUES. THIS NEEDS TO STOP. BEFORE WE GET ANOTHER GENERATION HOOKED ON NICOTINE AND SADLY. WE MAY ALREADY BE TOO LATE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE IN CENTER MAJOR. I CONCUR THANK YOU. FOR OKAY THANK YOU MEMBERS THANK YOU ALL RIGHT SO -- THE BILL IS BEEN -- SECONDED BY -- CENTER STONE THE MOTION IS TO PASS APPROPRIATIONS SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. AN HI CAN I STONE.

LEYVA LEYVA AYE MITCHELL HI MITCHELL AYE MONNING AYE MONNING AYE RUBIO [inaudible] RUBIO I THE BILL HAS EIGHT VOTES -- WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU. OKAY LET'S MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER FOUR SB THIRTY NINE CENTER HELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SB THIRTY NINE WILL IMPOSE STRICTER AGE VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS FOR TOBACCO PRODUCTS SOLD ONLINE. OR BY MAIL THE SALE OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS ONLINE PRESENT SIGNIFICANT A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM. MANY INTERNET TOBACCO VENDORS DO LITTLE TO VERIFY THE AGE AND IDENTITY OF THEIR CUSTOMERS MAKING IT VERY EASY FOR MINORS TO PURCHASE TOBACCO PRODUCTS. SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE CONCLUDED THAT YOU'D HAVE EASY ACCESS TO TOBACCO PRODUCTS ONLINE CENTER HELL IF I CAN PLEASE ASK -- PEOPLE TO I KNOW HIM AND STEEP SOME PEOPLE LEAVING THESE BE SOUNDS WE CAN HEAR AS PRESENTATION THANK YOU. ONE SUCH STUDY THE TALKS ABOUT TOBACCO SALES AND PRODUCTS ON LINE ONE STUDY EVEN FOUND THAT MINERS WERE SUCCESSFUL IN BUYING E. CIGARETTES ONLINE 93% OF THE TIME. AND 95% OF THE CIGARETTE DELIVERIES WERE SIMPLY LEFT AT THE DOOR AS AMAZON DOES. MODEL AFTER STANDARDS FOR ALCOHOL DELIVERY AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES JUMP A MEMBERS. SB THIRTY NINE WILL REQUIRE TOBACCO PRODUCTS TO BE. ONLY IN CONTAINERS LABELED WITH THE WORDS CONTAINS TOBACCO PRODUCTS SIGNATURE OR PERSON TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER REQUIRED FOR DELIVERY JUST IS DONE TODAY WITH ALCOHOL. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRE TOBACCO VENDORS TO OBTAIN THE SIGNATURE OF A PERSON TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER BEFORE DELIVERING A TOBACCO PRODUCT WHILE MY PREVIOUS BILL SB. THIRTY EIGHT PROHIBITS THE RETAIL SALES OF FLAVORED TOBACCO SB THIRTY NINE TAKES STEPS TO BLOCK YOUTH ACCESS TO TOBACCO PRODUCTS VIA ONLINE OR MAIL DELIVERY BUT I THINK THE IMPORTANT PART HERE IS IT. FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS ARE STILL AVAILABLE ONLINE. RIGHT NOW IT IS FAR TOO EASY FOR USED TO BUY TOBACCO ONLINE THIS BILL ESTABLISHES A BASELINE PROTECTIONS THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE FOR ALCOHOL AND OTHER PRODUCTS. WE HAVE A COUPLE OF WHAT WONDERFUL WITNESSES TO SUPPORT THANK YOU MET MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU CENTER HELLO WITNESSES SUPPORT. HELLO MY NAME IS THE SALUTE AND I'M THE FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT OF INTERNATIONAL USE TOBACCO CONTROL. WHICH IS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION COMPRISED OF TWO HUNDRED HIGH SCHOOLERS IN THE US. CANADA. CHINA PAKISTAN AND SAUDI ARABIA. WE SEEK TO PREVENT TEENAGE DOUBLE SMOKING GLOBALLY THROUGH LEGISLATIVE REFORM AND EDUCATIONAL AWARENESS AND READY REACHED THREE THOUSAND YOUTH INTERNATIONALLY. SO IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN INTERNATIONAL USED TOBACCO CONTROL SURVEY TO FIVE EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN STUDENTS GLOBALLY AND WE FOUND A TEENAGE SMOKING RATE OF 12%. WHICH IS MORE THAN TWICE THE AMOUNT IN CALIFORNIA. SO WHY IS THERE'S A SIGNATURE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE ONE IS BECAUSE OF LEGISLATION IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE LEGAL SMOKING AGE TO BE TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD. SECOND IS BECAUSE OF REGULATION BECAUSE THE ID CARD NEEDS T BE CHECKED FOR EVERY TOBACCO PURCHASE. ALLOWS THESE EDUCATION WITH ALL HIGH SCHOOLERS BEING REQUIRED TO TAKE A HEALTH CLASS IN HIGH SCHOOL. HOWEVER OVER THE YEARS THESE THE SAFETY NET THAT WE CREATED FOR TEENAGERS HAVE BEEN BREACHED. BY THE IN ADEQUATE REGULATION ON THE ONLINE TOBACCO SALES. WE'RE GOING TO A. B. C. NEWS WE SEE. CHILDREN LIKE FOURTEEN YEAR OLD BORING JACOBSEN BEING ABLE TO PURCHASE 50% OF HER ONLINE TOBACCO ORDER WE ALSO SEE KIDS LIKE A YEAR OLD IN NIKO WHO IS ABLE TO RECEIVE THREE CARTONS OF REGION YEAH LIGHT AFTER HIS ONLINE PURCHASE. AND EVEN SEVEN YOUR JOEY WHO ACTUALLY ENTERED HIS BILL BIRTHDAY ONTO HIS ONLINE PURCHASE. BUT WAS STILL DELIVERED A TOBACCO PACKAGE IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS ARTS PORSCHE. THESE ARE CHILDREN THESE ARE CHILDREN WHO ARE CURIOUS THESE ARE CHILDREN WHO DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE MANIPULATION OF THE BIG TOBACCO INDUSTRY THESE ARE CHILDREN BECOME EASILY ADDICTED. TO THESE PRODUCTS FOR THE BECOME BY ONLINE. SO IT'S TIME THAT CALIFORNIA'S STEP UP AGAINST THIS ONLINE MISS REGULATION. AND WITH. WITH BEING ABLE TO REINFORCE OUR LEGISLATION REGULATION EDUCATION WITH BILL FOR SB THIRTY NINE WE CAN SEE STRICTER REGULATION. THROUGH STRICTER LEGISLATION ON THE ONLINE TOBACCO AGE VERIFICATION AS WELL AS INCREASING THE PARENTAL SUPERVISION AND PREVENTING SMOKING BEFORE YOU EVEN START. SO TODAY ON ON BEHALF OF INTERNATIONAL USED TOBACCO CONTROL ON BEHALF OF ALL THE TEENAGERS WERE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THE CALIFORNIA SENATE.

HER TITLE I'M MITCHELL HI MITCHELL I THAT BILLS OUT. NINE ZERO OKAY SO WITH THAT LET'S MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER SEVEN THE CEREMONY WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I'M HERE AGAIN TODAY BECAUSE CALIFORNIA REMAINS IN CRISIS. A CRISIS THAT IS IMPACTED EACH AND EVERYONE OF OUR DISTRICTS AND THAT ARE SHOWN NO SIGNS OF RELENTING. THE EPIDEMIC OF SKYROCKETING RATES OF OBESITY AND PREVENTABLE TYPE TWO DIABETES CONTINUES TO WREAK HAVOC. ON THE HEALTH AND HAPPINESS OF OUR CONSTITUENTS IN BURDENS OUR STATE WITH BILLIONS IN HEALTH CARE COSTS RELATED TO THE TREATMENT OF THESE CHRONIC PREVENTABLE DISEASES. OVER THE LAST DECADE AN AVALANCHE OF PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH HAS DEFINITIVELY CONCLUDED THAT THE MAIN DRIVER BEHIND THE GROWTH OF THESE PREVENTABLE HEALTH CONDITIONS. IS THE INCREASED CONSUMPTION OF SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES. SUGAR DRINKS ARE THE SINGLE LARGEST SOURCE OF ADDED SUGARS IN THE AMERICAN DIET. IN ARE A MAJOR SOURCE OF EXCESS CALORIES THAT OFTEN PROVIDE NO NUTRITIONAL VALUE. STUDIES SHOW THAT DRINKING JUST ONE SUGARY DRINK A DAY INCREASES IN ADULTS LIKELIHOOD OF BEING OVER WEIGHT BY 27% AND A CHILD'S BY 55%. LAST YEAR WHEN THIS COMMITTEE PASSED A SIMILAR VERSION OF THIS BILL. THE OPPOSITION ARGUED THAT CONSUMER EDUCATION WHAT'S THE BEST STRATEGY TO PREVENT OVER CONSUMPTION OF SUGARY DRINKS. I WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SENATE BILL THREE FORTY SEVEN DOES THIS BILL INFORMS CHOICE. THIS BILL WILL EMPOWER CONSUMERS TO MAKE INFORMED CHOICES ABOUT THE BEVERAGES THEY PURCHASE BY REQUIRING A SCIENCE BASED HEALTH WARNING LABEL TO BE PLACED ON SUGARY BEVERAGES. THAT ARE SOLD IN CALIFORNIA IN THE CONTAINS SEVENTY FIVE CALORIES OR MORE PER TWELVE FLUID OUNCES OF SUGAR. WARNING LABELS ARE PROVEN AND EFFECTIVE MEANS OF INFLUENCING CONSUMER BEHAVIOR NEVER BEEN USED SUCCESSFULLY. ON TOBACCO AND ALCOHOL PRODUCTS FOR DECADES. A RECENT STUDY BY THE RED CENTER WHICH IS REFERENCED IN THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS FOUND THAT DECEPTIVELY BILLING DIRECTLY IMPACTED A PARENT'SPERCEPTION OF BEVERAGES. LEADING MANY TO INCORRECTLY BELIEVE THAT SUGARY DRINKS LABELED AS FRUIT DRINKS AND SPORTS TEAS WERE HEALTHIER OPTIONS FOR THEIR CHILDREN. WARNING LABELS ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF A BROAD PUBLIC HEALTH CAMPAIGN TO COUNTER THESE DECEPTIVE MARKETING STRATEGIES AND HELP CONSUMERS MAKE AN INFORMED CHOICE ABOUT THE KNOWN ADVERSE HEALTH IMPACTS. OF SUGARY DRINKS. ONE IN THREE CHILDREN BORN AFTER THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND IS PREDICTED TO DEVELOP TYPE TWO DIABETES DURING HIS OR HER LIFETIME. AND THAT NUMBER JUMPS TO ONE INTO FOR LATINO AND AFRICAN AMERICAN CHILDREN. ASKS THAT YOU JOIN ME IN THE ENTIRE MEDICAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNITY AND TAKING A BOLD STEP. TOWARD PREVENTING THAT STATISTIC FROM BECOMING TRUE IN CALIFORNIA. SENATE BILL THREE FORTY SEVEN WILL PROMOTE INFORMED CONSUMER CHOICE AND WILL LEAD TO BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME IN MISTER CHAIR I'D LIKE TO PRESENT. TO WITNESSES -- IN SUPPORT. DOCTOR CROW FOR WITH SENIORS THE SENIOR DIRECTOR POLICY OF PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES IN TONY KALI PAIRING LIFESTYLE COACH FOR DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM THANK YOU I THANK YOU WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DOCTOR FLOWS ON CO FOR AND I AM THE SENIOR DIRECTOR OF POLICY FOR PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES. TOGETHER WITH THE CALIFORNIA BLACK HEALTH NETWORK IN THE LATINO COALITION FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA WE ARE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR SB THREE FORTY SEVEN TO PLACE HEALTH WARNING LABELS ON SUGARY DRINKS. THE FINANCE ABOUT THE LINK BETWEEN SUGARY DRINKS AND HEALTH OUTCOMES IS INCONTROVERTIBLE SO THE INDUSTRY HAS CENTER THEIR OPPOSITION AROUND SEVERAL EASILY REPEATABLE ARGUMENTS WHICH I WILL. ARGUMENT NUMBER ONE WARNING LABELS DO NOT WORK SIMPLY STATED THIS IS FALSE ACCORDING TO A STUDY PUBLISHED IN PEDIATRICS IN FEBRUARY TWENTY SIXTEEN WARNING LABELS ARE THREE TIMES. MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRIES CLEAR ON CALORIE LABELS IN HELPING PARENTS CHOOSE A DRINK WITHOUT ADDED SUGAR. WARNING LABELS ALSO HELP CUSTOMERS DISTINGUISH BETWEEN PRODUCTS THAT ARE A 100% FRUIT JUICE AND FRUIT FLAVORED DRINKS WITH ADDED SUGAR WHICH ARE OFTEN DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH. FOR THIS REASON THREE QUARTERS OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS SUPPORT WARNING LABELS WITH EVEN HIGHER SUPPORT AMONG BLACK AND LATINO RESIDENTS. ARGUMENT NUMBER TWO IS THAT WARNING LABELS KILL JOBS. THIS BILL DOESN'T CHANGE THE COST OF PRODUCTS OR RESTRICT THEIR SALE IN ANYWAY BUT NO LEGISLATION WILL STOP PEOPLE FROM BEING THIRSTY. DATA FROM BERKELEY SHOWS THE AFTER THEIR THEIR SUGARY DRINK TAX WAS ENACTED NO IT JOBS WERE LOST BECAUSE PEOPLE STILL BOUGHT DRINKS THEY JUST SHIFTED TO LOWER CALORIE DRINKS. THE SAME PATTERN CAN BE EXPECTED FOR WARNING LABELS ADDITIONALLY THE PENALTIES FOR VIOLATING THIS NEW ARE MINIMAL A FIRST VIOLATION IN KERR'S NO FEE AND SIMPLY A WARNING. AND SUBSEQUENT VIOLATIONS ARE FIFTY TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS THE CALLING THIS BILL A JOB KILLER IS A BASELESS ASSERTION. ARGUMENT NUMBER THREE THE SAN FRANCISCO WARNING LABELS OVERTURNED. THE PANEL DID RULING IN -- AGAINST THE SAN FRANCISCO WARNING LABEL BUT ONLY BECAUSE THEY FELT THAT THE 20% FIVE REQUIREMENT WAS LARGER THAN NECESSARY. SEPARATELY JUDGES OPINED ABOUT THE WORDING OF THE LABEL. TO BE CLEAR THE RULING EXPRESSLY DID NOT ADDRESS WHETHER SMALLER WARNING LABELS ARE SIMILARLY OBJECTIONABLE OR IF THE TEXT OF THE WARNING IS PURELY FACTUAL IN UNCONTROVERSIAL. SB THREE FORTY SEVEN ADDRESSES THE RULING AND THE JUDGE'S OPINION THAT IT DOES NOT SPECIFY A MINIMUM SIZE FOR THE LABEL ONLY A MINIMUM SIZE FOR THE FIGHT TO ENSURE LEGIBILITY. AND ALSO WE USE THAT THE JUDGES RECOMMEND RECOMMENDED PHRASES OF TYPE TWO DIABETES AND MAY CONTRIBUTE. AN ARGUMENT NUMBER FOUR THE FDA SAYS THAT SUGAR IS SAFE. THE FDA SAYS THAT SUGAR IS SAFE EXCEPT WHEN CONSUMED IN EXCESS AMOUNTS SB THREE FORTY SEVEN TARGETS HIGH CALORIE DRINKS THOSE WITH ADDED SUGAR AND MORE THAN SEVENTY FIVE CALORIES PER TWELVE OUNCE. THE EXCESS AMOUNTS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED RISK OF DISEASE. AN OP ED THE AMERICAN BEVERAGE ASSOCIATION AND THE CALIFORNIA GROCERS ASSOCIATION HAVE STATED AND I QUOTE WE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER GOVERNMENT INDUSTRY AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNITY TO EDUCATE CONSUMERS AND EMPOWER THEM TO MAKE CHOICES THAT ARE BEST FOR THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES. SB THREE FORTY SEVEN IS THE POLICY ANSWER TO THIS PLATITUDE. GIVE CONSUMERS THE INFORMATION SO THEY CAN MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION ON WHAT TO DRINK. THERE IS A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THEIR TALKING POINTS AND CONTINUED OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL AND OTHER BILLS THAT HELP CONSUMERS MAKE HEALTHY CHOICES LAST YEAR THE NEGOTIATED A TWELVE YEAR STATEWIDE PROHIBITION ON LOCAL TAXES. IF THEY REFUSE TO PAY FOR THE DISEASES THEY COST AT THE VERY LEAST WE SHOULD MAKE THEM TELL CONSUMERS THE TRUTH. THIS BILL IS ABOUT WHOSE INTEREST WE VALUE MOST CONSUMERS HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW THIS INFORMATION THEY WANT TO KNOW THIS INFORMATION AND THE INDUSTRY DOESN'T HAVE A FACTUAL OR CONSISTENT ARGUMENT AGAINST SUPPLYING THIS INFORMATION. FOR THESE REASONS I ENCOURAGE YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SHE LETS YOU ABOUT TWO MINUTES AND TEN SECONDS. WELL LET ME IS IT ON BECAUSE YOUR LET ME JUST THANK THE SENATE BECAUSE YOU SORT PORTED MY WORK IN THE PAST. WITH YES THE COLLEGE OF AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN'S HEALTH LEGACY. AND IN TWENTY FIFTEEN YOU VOTED A RESOLUTION TO SUPPORT OUR EDUCATING THE COMMUNITY ABOUT SOME OF THE RISK FACTORS THAT AFFECTING OUR PEOPLE. SETTLE ON MY NAME IS TONY KALI PERRY AND I AM HERE TO SUPPORT SB THREE FORTY SEVEN TO PUT HEALTH WARNING LABELS ON SUGARY DRINKS. OBD EARLY THIS MORNING I WAS TEACHING FIFTH GRADERS AND I ASKED THEM WHAT DO THEY THINK ABOUT IT YOU KNOW THERE I GO FOR IT THE THEY REALLY ONCE YOU RE DRINKS AND IT SHOWED ME. HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT THEY HAVE THIS HAPPENING SO THE PARENTS CAN ACTUALLY HELP THEM SO -- I'M GONNA READ MY TALKING POINTS I CAN STICK VERY CLOSE TO THE MINUTES -- IN NOVEMBER I WAS TRAINED AS A LIFESTYLE COACH FOR THE DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM. KNOWN AS DPP DPP IS A YEAR LONG PREVENTION PROGRAM FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE. PRE DIABETES HIGH BLOOD. SUGAR THAT PUTS THEM AT RISK OF DIABETES ALMOST HALF OF THE CALIFORNIANS 446% HAVE PRE DIABETES I'M ONE OF THEM I HAVE. MY DIABETES RATING IS I THINK IT'S SIX POINT ONE SIX POINT SEVEN WHICH IS. ODD TECHNICALLY A DIABETIC -- IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN BUDGET THE BUDGET LEGISLATOR MADE THE PPO FULLY FUNDED PROGRAM FOR MEDI CAL. DPP HELPS PARTICIPANTS MAKE LIFESTYLE CHANGES TO ADDRESS STRESS DIET AND EXERCISE. THE GOAL OF THE PROGRAM IS AT LEAST 5% WEIGHT LOSS AND ONE OF THE CHALLENGES FOR EVERY ANYONE TRYING TO REDUCE THE RISK OF DIABETES OR MANAGE THEIR DIABETES IS TO CORRECTLY CHOOSING. HEALTHY FOODS AND BEVERAGES OPTIONS. NUTRITION LABELS ARE DIFFICULT TO READ AND UNDERSTAND FOR MOST PEOPLE KNOWING WHICH PRODUCTS HAVE ADDED SUGAR IS ESPECIALLY HELPFUL IN IDENTIFYING LOWER SUGAR PRODUCTS. THAT ARE BETTER FOR HEALTH THE WARNING LABELS WOULD. IT IT. LET ME THE WARNING LABELS WHAT IT EASIER WELL I DON'T THINK THAT'S QUITE RIGHT. LET ME JUST SAY THIS IF THE WARNING LABELS WITH THEIR PEOPLE WOULD CHOOSE HIGH HELP YOUR TOUCH -- OPTIONS. BEING ABLE TO TEACH PEOPLE ATTENDING THE DPP SESSIONS TO LOOK. FOR THE ICON IN LIMIT DRINKS THAT HAVE IT WOULD BE A GREAT TOOL. MANY DATE PP PARTICIPANTS STRUGGLE TO LOSE WEIGHT. BECAUSE THEY FOCUS ON EATING FEWER CALORIES BUT DON'T REALIZE HOW MANY CALORIES AND HOW MUCH SUGAR IN THEIR DRINKS. SB THREE FOUR SEVEN WILL HELP ALL CALIFORNIANS KNOW WHICH DRINKS HAVE ADDED SUGAR. AND IT ESPECIALLY HELPFUL FOR PEOPLE WITH DIABETES AND PRE DIABETES TO LIMIT THEIR LARGEST SOURCE OF DIETARY SUGAR DRINKS. SERVICE RISEN WRAP UP. I THINK I CAN DO IT IN THREE WORDS. ARE FOR THESE REASONS I'D ASK FOR YOU TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF SB -- THREE FORTY SEVEN OKAY THANK YOU GOT IT. PURPOSE OF FAIRNESS IF THE OPPOSITION NEEDS OF OUR TIME WHAT TO GIVE THE SAME OUTSIDE.

TO SOLO ALLOW YOU UP TO SIX AND A HALF MINUTES ALTHOUGH AGAIN YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE ALL THE TIME IF YOU DON'T WISH TO JUST BUT WELCOME. THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CARELL COOK AND I REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION AND WE ARE OPPOSED TO SB. THREE FORTY SEVEN CMT REPRESENTS FOUR HUNDRED MANUFACTURING BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA SECTOR THAT GENERATES MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY BILLION DOLLARS EVERY YEAR TO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY AND EMPLOYS MORE THAN ONE POINT THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS. CALIFORNIA'S BEVERAGE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY EMPLOYS OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THOSE EMPLOYEES AND PRODUCES TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS. TOWARD THE STATE'S ECONOMY SEEM TO SUPPORT SCIENCE BASED REGULATIONS THAT MAKE SENSE AND DO NOT PUT CALIFORNIA'S MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY AT A DISADVANTAGE. REGRETFULLY SB THREE FORTY SEVEN DOES NOT MEET THAT STANDARD BECAUSE IT IS A STATE SPECIFIC LABELING LAW FOR A SUBSET OF FOOD AND BEVERAGE PRODUCTS AND IT PUTS CALIFORNIA'S AT A DISADVANTAGE IN FURTHER EXPOSE THOSE MANUFACTURERS. THEIR DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAILERS TO LIABILITY -- FIRST IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT BEVERAGE CONTAINERS ARE ALREADY REGULATED BY THE FDA CONTAIN FACTUAL NUTRITION DETAILS TO PROPERLY INFORM CONSUMER CHOICE SUGAR CONTENTIS CLEAR. AND LESS CONFUSING THAN THE SCHEME THAT THIS LABEL WOULD CREATE -- BUT STATE SPECIFIC LABEL IN ADDITION TO CREATING THIS CONFUSION FOR THE CONSUMER BECAUSE ADDITIONAL BURDENS FOR MANUFACTURERS. WE'LL BE CLEAR ABOUT THE THE WAY THAT THIS IMPACTS JOBS AND THAT'S NOT IN THE OVERALL CONSUMPTION BUT THE WAY IT AFFECTS THE WAY THAT WE PRODUCE -- BEVERAGES AND AND OUR PRODUCTION. CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURES AND I JUST PRODUCING FOR THE CALIFORNIA MARKET WE'RE PRODUCING. FOR A MULTI STATE MARKET AS WELL AS A GLOBAL MARKET AND WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN WE HAVE TO PRODUCE -- SPECIFICALLY FOR A A LABEL THAT SPECIFIC TO CALIFORNIA OR CALIFORNIA FACILITIES -- WILL BE THE PRODUCTION WAS SHIFTED TO CALIFORNIA AND IT BECOMES LESS EFFICIENT TO PRODUCE FOR FOR OTHER STATES AND SO THE PRODUCTION THAT WOULD BE BASED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IS THEN MOVED TO NEVADA NEW MEXICO TEXAS -- SOMEPLACE ELSE I CAN SERVE THE SAME MARKET AND SO WHEN OUR PRODUCTION AND OUR FACILITIES GOES DOWN THAT'S WHEN WE CUT JOBS AND SO THAT'S HOW THIS ENDS UP. HURTING A D. V. GOOD MIDDLE CLASS JOBS THAT WE CREATE. THERE IS ALSO AN ADDITIONAL PUNITIVE ELEMENT FOR MANUFACTURERS WHO DISTRIBUTORS SELL -- YOU HAVE THEIR BUS SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES DISTRIBUTED OR SOLD IN CALIFORNIA THEY MAY NOT END UP KNOWING WHERE THE PRODUCT GOES -- BUT THEY STILL FACE THE SAME LIABILITY -- FOR THESE REASONS SEEM TAY'S OPPOSE SB THREE FORTY SEVEN URGES A NO VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ARE MATT CERTAIN I'M OF THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION -- WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL CERTAINLY APPRECIATE SENATOR MUNNINGS CONTINUED DEDICATION TO THE TO THE UNDERLYING ISSUE -- HERE -- BUT FOR US THIS IS GREAT UNIQUE IMPACTS WITHIN THE FOUR WALLS OF A RESTAURANT -- THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN A LEADER FOR YEARS IN THIS BUILDING ON NUTRITION WHEN IT COMES TO RESTAURANTS WE ENGAGED AND AGREED TO TO MENU LABELING PROVISIONS YEARS AGO THAT BROUGHT NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION ON TO OUR MENUS. WE'VE PARTNERED ON A NUMBER OF OTHER DIFFERENT THINGS IN THIS BUILDING INCLUDING SB ELEVEN NINETY TWO WAS SENATOR MINING LAST YEAR. WHERE WE VERY? DIFFICULT WE MOVED OUR MEMBERSHIP INTO A NEUTRAL TERRITORY WITH REGARD TO THE AUTOMATIC DRINK THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE WITH REGARD TO CHILDREN'S MEALS AND SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES. WE WENT NEUTRAL ON THAT WE WORKED VERY HARD WE'RE A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED THAT AFTER. THAT PARTNERSHIP HERE WE ARE WITH WITH THIS BILL AGAIN SO I WOULD LIKE TO JUST HIGHLIGHT SOME ISSUES OF HOW THIS COMES INTO THE FOUR WALLS OF A RESTAURANT. TYPICALLY IN THIS DISCUSSION THE RESTAURANT ISSUES TAKE ASIDE SIDE SEAT IN ART DON'T GET A LOT OF FOCUS SO I'D LIKE TO JUST WALK YOU THROUGH EXACTLY WHAT HOW WE BELIEVE THIS WORKS. THIS BILL REQUIRES THESE WARNINGS AT THE POINT OF SALE. TECHNICALLY IT'S THE POINT OF PURCHASE IN THE BILL IT'S THE SAME THING. SO FOR US POINT OF SALE IS CONSTANTLY MOVING ESPECIALLY WITH TECHNOLOGY THESE DAYS IT'S EVOLVING ALL OVER MANY OF YOU KNOW FROM ORDERING FOOD. WHETHER YOU'RE IN A RESTAURANT OR OUT OF A RESTAURANT THE ORDERING IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN IT USED TO BE AND SO WHETHER YOU'RE A FAST CASUAL RESTAURANT. A FULL SERVICE SIT DOWN RESTAURANT WERE QUICK SERVICE RESTAURANT THE POINT OF SALE IS DIFFERENT AND EVEN WITHIN THE SAME RESTAURANTS THE POINT OF SALE CAN BE DIFFERENT. FOR DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE MAKING DIFFERENT TRANSACTIONS. AND SO WE'RE LEFT WONDERING YOU KNOW WHERE IS THE POINT OF SALE WE'RE CONSTANTLY SING THE POINT OF SALE CHANGE IN RESTAURANTS. SO IS IT ON THE APPLICATION WHEN YOU ORDER IS IT ON THE WEBSITE IS IT THE TRADITIONAL CASH REGISTER IS IT THE WAIT STAFF AND A FULL SERVICE RESTAURANT THAT MUST WARN YOU IS IT ON THE BILL. AT THE END OF A MEAL IN A FULL SERVICE RESTAURANT IS IT ON THE RECEIPT. IS IT ON THE MENU IS IT ON THE MENU BOARD THE LIST GOES ON AND IT CREATES A COMPLIANCE NIGHTMARE FOR US IT ALSO RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT PUTTING POSTINGS. EVERYWHERE TO COMPLY WITH THE BILL AND THEN YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF WHAT IS THE VALUE OF THAT ARE YOU DESENSITIZING PEOPLE -- IN SIMILAR WAYS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE PREVIOUS GOVERNOR HAD MENTIONED ABOUT PROP SIXTY FIVE SIGNS. THOSE WE ALSO POST IN RESTAURANTS -- AND AND SO WE DON'T WANT THIS TO BECOME A NEW PROP SIXTY FIVE BURDEN FOR US BUT I THINK MORE SUPER SUPER DESCRIPTIVE. THE LANGUAGE IS DESCRIPTIVE THE COLOR OF THE BACKGROUND IS DESCRIPTIVE -- AND THEN THE SCARY SYMBOL THAT'S INVOLVED IS DESCRIPTIVE AND FOR US WE BELIEVE THAT THE POINT OF SALE SITUATION WOULD REQUIRE US TO PUT IT ALL OVER THE PLACE -- FOR THOSE AND OTHER REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED TO WE WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU KNOW VOTE. WHICH CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JOHN LATTIMER MATH CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION WE HAVE SOME MORE IN STORE ISSUES AT THE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION POINTED OUT. WE'RE ALSO CERTAINLY ALIGN WITH OUR MANUFACTURER PARTNERS BUT WE TO OUR MANUFACTURE WITH A LOT OF PRIVATE LABEL BRANDS WE HAVE SOME OF THE SAME LABELING ISSUES OF THE MANUFACTURERS WELL. FOR THOSE REASONS IN THE REASONS STATED WERE OPPOSITION. OKAY OTHER WITNESSES OPPOSITION BACKED BY PHONE PLEASE MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MAP BROUGHT ON BEHALF THE TEAMSTERS IN OPPOSITION. MORE TOP ON BEHALF OF ORANGE COUNTY BUSINESS COUNCIL IN OPPOSITION. CAROLINE BEALE HUNTER ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA FUELS INCONVENIENCE LINES IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. ELLERY NEAR FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. REFERENCE OF REGULAR HONOR ON BEHALF OF THE CAN MANUFACTURES INSTITUTE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. JOHN YOU AND ON BEHALF THE GROCERY MANUFACTURERS IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. DENNIS I'LL BE ON AND WE HAVE THE ALLMAN ALLIANCE IN OPPOSITION AS WELL THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON KATE BELLAMY HALF THE CALIFORNIA AUTOMATIC VENDORS COUNCIL WERE OPPOSED BECAUSE JENNIFER LABEL ON THE OUTSIDE OF ALL OF OUR VENDING MACHINES. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT -- SINGLE KNOWN AS OF MICROPHONE QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SENATOR MITCHELL [inaudible] THANK YOU. AIR -- ONE QUICK QUESTION THEN OF A BROADER STATEMENT SO THAT THE RESTAURANT. ASSOCIATION JUST -- TO ME -- AND SO. DO YOU INTEND TO ADDRESS OUR ISSUES IN YOUR CLOSING OR HOW YOU GONNA MANAGE AT LET ME JUST BUT OKAY RIGHT NOW THIS BECAUSE IF I GO TO A RESTAURANT MY ORDER -- ITS BEVERAGE IN ITS THIRD TO ME IN A GLASS LEGITIMATE CONCERN I THINK. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT THE ASSOCIATION MAYBE OBFUSCATED A LITTLE BIT -- WHAT WOULD BE ENTAILED? SAID WE DO HAVE I ACKNOWLEDGE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF FOOD SERVICE SO IN FAST FOOD OFTEN YOU SERVE YOURSELF AT A ANSWERING MACHINE. ONE LABEL ONE TIME YOU'RE COVERED -- IF IT'S TABLE SERVICE IT'S IN THE MENU. AT THE BEVERAGE SAID LIKE THE LIKE WHAT YOUR CALORIES NOW SO. WE'RE GLAD TO WORK WITH THEM ON NARROWING HER OR SPECIFYING. THAT WE'VE ALL THIS IS NOT NEW TERRITORY -- IT'S BEEN DONE WITH CALORIE WARNINGS -- AND I THINK FOR A LOT OF THE FAST FOOD PLACES. ONE LABEL ONCE ON THAT MACHINE NOW THEY MAKE THE CASE WILL PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE NUMB TO IT LIKE PROP SIXTY FIVE WARNING SO -- I'M FIRST TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS ISN'T THE SOLUTION BUT FROM YOU HEARD FROM THE SUPPORT OF WITNESSES IT'S PART OF A BROAD PUBLIC HEALTH STRATEGY. OF GIVING PARENTS ESPECIALLY THE TOOLS TO MAKE INFORMED CHOICES THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. THANK YOU AND GETTING TO YOUR POINT ABOUT IT'S NOT THE STRATEGY -- FIVE CO AUTHOR AND SUPPORTED YOU IN THIS BILL AND YET EVERY YEAR I BRING YOU WHATEVER LATEST OUR ARTICLE I HAVE FOUND ON THE FACT THAT SUGAR IS THE DEVIL. FROM AND YOU KNOW AND I WONDER -- IT IF THE IN THAT THIS HAS BEEN AN UP HILL BATTLE. AND THE VALIDITY OF US EXPLAINING THIS POLITICAL CAPITAL. ON THIS STRATEGY WHERE WE ARE REALLY IGNORING. ALL THE OTHER PLACES WE FIND SUGAR -- YOU KNOW AND IN MY ISSUE WITH YOU HAS BEEN IN JUICES THAT THAT WE ALL CAN LINE UP AND GET MAD AT YOU KNOW THE SODA INDUSTRY BUT YOU KNOW APPLE JUICE AND THE OTHER PLACES WHERE SUGAR ARE AT AT EQUAL LEVELS IF NOT MORE. THE BILL GOES ON AND ON THE JUICES NOW BUT BUT NATURAL JUICE BUT ON SUGAR ADDED JUICE. THE LABEL IS NOT BASED ON THE PRODUCT NAME IT'S BASED ON THE CONTENT ADDED ADDED SUGAR. AND SO YOU KNOW WE REALLY HOPING THAT AT SOME POINT -- GIVING YOUR TRUE INTENT WHICH IS THE IMPACT -- INCIDENCE OF OBESITY AND DIABETES AND REALLY BEGINNING TO HAVE AN HONEST WITH OURSELVES EVERYBODY ELSE CONVERSATION ABOUT ALL THE PLACES ADDED SUGAR AND SUGAR IS. BUT I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO TELL ME THAT THIS IS THE NUMBER ONE PLACE ABOVE WILL BLOCK. BUT BUTTON WE WORK WITH IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE WE ARE NOT IN A PLACE WE ARE ADVANCING THIS CONVERSATION -- IN A MEANINGFUL WAY TO REALLY HAVE A MEANINGFUL IMPACT ON THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND I'M. I APPRECIATE AND IN WITH YOU BUT I REALLY HOPE THAT AT SOME POINT WE'RE ABLE TO DANCE IS CONVERSATION ALL -- IN A TRUE HONEST -- WAY. ONE THING I APPRECIATE ABOUT YOU SENATOR IS. YOUR HONESTY. IN YOUR DIRECTNESS. IN. AND WE'RE IN AGREEMENT. I'M THE FIRST TO SAY. PREVENTABLE DIABETES YOUTH OBESITY IS MULTI FACTORIAL THIS BUT THERE'S A REASON WHY ALL THE PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES AND WHY THE DOCTORS AND THE SCIENTISTS. IN IN THIS RECENT AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS WHY ARE THEY ALL FOCUSING ON SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES AND THERE'S AN ANSWER TO THAT. THERE ARE SUGAR AND OTHER FOOD PRODUCTS WE WANT TO REDUCE SUGAR INTAKE. ONLY A FOOD PRODUCT A DIFFERENT PASS WITH PERMISSION OF THE CHAIR MISSION OF THE CHAIR TO USE THAT DEMONSTRATED. THANK YOU. THIS IS A TWENTY FLUID OUNCE BOTTLE. AND IT CONTAINS THE EQUIVALENT OF SIXTEEN TEASPOONS OF SUGAR. SO IT ASK YOU OR THE FOOD INDUSTRY OR THE MEDICAL PROFESSION. TO FIND ME A FOOD PRODUCT THAT PACKS THAT MUCH CONCENTRATED SUGAR. INTO A PRODUCT WITH NO OTHER NUTRITIONAL VALUE. IF A CHILD DRINKS TWO OF THESE A DAY THEY'RE INCREASING THEIR RISK FOR DIABETES ACQUISITION. BY 26%. SO WE CAN LOOK AT OTHER FOODS THEY HAVE SUGAR WE ALSO KNOW FROM THE DOCTORS NOT THE POLITICIANS. THAT THE LIQUID DELIVERY. GO STRAIGHT TO THE PANCREAS IN THE LIVER CONVERTS THE SUGAR TO FAT IN A MANNER THAT FOOD PRODUCTS DON'T. SO THERE'S A SCIENTIFIC RESPONSE NOT A POLITICAL RESPONSE BUT I'M THE FIRST ONE TO SIGN UP TO WORK WITH YOU. IF WE WANNA LABEL OTHER PRODUCTS THAT HAVE DANGEROUS. SUGARS OR OTHER ADDITIVES -- MUCH OF THIS. MADAM SENATORAND MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. WE HEARD A LOT OF TESTIMONY ON THE MARKETING OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS. YOU COULD SWITCH THE WORD TOBACCO FOR SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES IN TERMS OF TARGETING MINORITY COMMUNITIES CHILDREN AT RISK MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES. WHY ARE THEY SPENDING ALL THEIR MONEY THERE AND SUBSIDIZING THE SALE BUY DISCOUNTED PRICING? THIS. IS A LIFE AND DEATH ISSUE AND WE HEAR THE CONCERNS OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY. FOR PROTECTING PROFITS AND MARKET SHARE. MY BILL IS TO PROTECT THE CHILDREN. AND LET ME SAY SENATOR MINDING MY RESPONSES IN THE POLITICAL RESPONSE EITHER IT IS A COMMUNITY BASED RESPONSE WHERE I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY TARGETING ACROSS THE BOARD -- FROM SO THIS TO POOR TO TO TO FOOD DESERT'S -- TO GET OLD FAST FOOD OPTIONS AND SO GIVE MY ONLY POINT IS. I HEAR YOU I GET IT BUT IT IN IN ALL HONESTY WE'VE GOT TO EXPAND THE CONVERSATION TO REALLY INCLUDE ALL OF THE BARRIERS THAT PREVENT THESE COMMUNITIES FROM LIVING HEALTHIER LIFESTYLES. AND SO THAT WAS JUST THE POINT I WANT TO MAKE SO I CAN STOP THAT. BOMBARDING YOU WITH THE ARTICLES I READ THE SAID THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS A BROADER CONVERSATION AROUND SUGAR SALT THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. THANK YOU A CENTER. SHE DOES IT SENATOR ALSO I THINK I SAW YOU FIRST AND THEN WALK OUT WITH CENTER RUBIO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION OF THE OF THE BILL -- AND I AM SUPPORTIVE I I DO WANT TO POINT OUT AS BEEN POINTED OUT TO ME THAT THERE IS A CONCERN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THE IMPACT THAT IT COULD HAVE ON JOBS -- WE NEVER WANT TO TRADE ONE FOR THE OTHER I KNOW THAT'S WHAT YOU BELIEVE WHEN YOU STAND FOR SO I DO WANT TO WORK WITH YOU -- TO SEE WHAT THE CONCERNS ARE -- HOW SERIOUSLY CONCERNS ARE AND I I DO WANT TO RIDICULOUSLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE TEAMSTERS UNION -- FOR DOING THEIR JOB WHICH IS TO PROTECT JOBS ON ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE GOOD UNION JOBS -- BUT I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL AND THEN YOU AND I KEEP TALKING ABOUT THIS AND MEETING WITH -- THOSE ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE TEAMSTERS -- IF THERE IS A SERIOUS CONCERN THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND IF I COULD JUST RESPOND BRIEFLY. I'VE HAD HEALTHY RESPECTFUL DIALOGUE WITH MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN THE TEAMSTERS -- I HAVE SEEN NO EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST HOW A WARNING LABEL IMPACTS JOBS WE'VE SEEN FROM THE BROADER PUBLIC HALTH EFFORTS. A DIVERSIFICATION OF PRODUCTS AND THAT'S WHERE THE LABELS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE BIG MANUFACTURES. THERE'S A DECLINE IN BUYING. THE CLEAR SODA PRODUCTS. AND THEY'RE BEING MOVED INTO SPORTS TEAMS -- ENERGY DRINKS IT CETERA WHICH WOULD ALSO GET THE LABEL [inaudible] THE MANUFACTURES. THEY'RE STILL SELLING THEIR PRODUCTS THEY NEED DRIVERS TO DRIVE THOSE TRUCKS TO DELIVER THE PRODUCTS NOTHING IN THIS BILL TAKES THE PRODUCT OFF THE SHELF. NOTHING IN THIS BILL HAS ANY DIRECT CORRELATION TO REDUCTION IN JOBS. IF ANYTHING IT'S GOING TO CREATE SOME MORE JOBS IN THE MANUFACTURING PLANTS AS THEY ROTATE THEIR BEVERAGE PRODUCTS THROUGH IN. IN NOW INCLUDE A LABEL THEY'VE ARGUED THAT THAT WOULD BE A BURDEN. TO HAVE TO LABEL THE PRODUCT -- IF YOU NOTICE IN THE HOLIDAYS THEY LABEL THE KANSEN THE BOTTLES WITH. A LEASE NAVIDAD LABELS AND THINGS LIKE THAT THEY THEY DIVERSIFY THEIR LABELS BASED ON ADVERTISING THEY CAN OF FIX A SINGLE LABEL THAT'S PERMANENT. WITHOUT LOSING JOBS [inaudible] RUBIO. THANK YOU. WELL I HAD THE SAME CONCERN AS MY COLLEAGUE -- SENATOR HOLLY MITCHELL I THINK FOR ME IT'S A BROADER CONVERSATION ABOUT -- LONGEVITY IN TERMS OF HEALTHIER LIFESTYLES AND I CAN SAY WITH CERTAINTY. NOT THAT I SUPPORT NECESSARY THE INDUSTRY I ADVISE ACCOUNTS MEMBER ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO ACTUALLY BEHIND SURREY DRINKS FROM. FROM VENDING MACHINES BUT THE CONVERSATION FOR ME IS. EXACTLY LIKE -- HOLLY SAID A BROADER CONVERSATION ABOUT. EVERYTHING ELSE AND I DON'T BELIEVE NECESSARY THAT. DIABETES IS JUST SOLELY BASED ON THIS PODUCT AND JUSTICE AND TO PREPARE FOR THIS I ACTUALLY WALKED DOWN THE AISLES OF A SUPERMARKET. AND I WAS TAKING PICTURES OF EVERY SINGLE LABEL AND AND I THINK OUT THERE IS A SENSE OF HOLES FALL TO IT. TO ASSUME THAT THIS IN PARTICULAR IS GOING TO DETER OUR OUR PARENTS FROM FROM NOT PICKING UP THAT ITEM AND I SAY THIS BECAUSE AS A VICE PRINCIPAL AT A SCHOOL I REMEMBER THAT WE BàN SUGARY DRINKS WE DON'T HAVE ON CAMPUS BUT YET. I CAN STOP KIDS FROM COMING -- WITH THEIR LUNCH WAS A FMILY SIZED BAG OF POTATO CHIPS AND I WOULD CONFISCATE THEM AND THEY WOULD STILL SHOW UP IN. THIS WENT ON FOR MONTHS AND MY POINT IS NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I TOOK COME. TO GET AWAY AND DIE AND AGAIN I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STREET TRAINS. THAT WAS THEIR LUNCHEON SO TO ME IT'S A BROADER CONVERSATION ABOUT EDUCATION AND AND THERE HAS TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE TO THAT SO WHAT I MEAN I THINK I HEARD YOU SAY EARLIER ABOUT TOP. THE SERVICE INDUSTRY YOU KNOW A LABEL ON ON THIS JUST ONE LABEL NOW BUT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IT KEEPS COMING AND COMING FOR THE WITH THE MENU AND THEN THE CALORIES AND THEN. SO I WANT TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE HOW DO WE ADDRESS THE CITY DIABETES. IN A BROADER CONVERSATION TO INCLUDE EVERYTHING THAT CAUSES THE DISEASE SO FOR ME. I'M NOT NECESSARY THERE AND THE SAFETY OF CHILDREN MATTERS TO ME MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. I'VE BEEN A YOU KNOW AN EDUCATOR FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS SO THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME CONCERN THE FACT THAT I ALSO COME FROM A LOW INCOME FAMILY INNER CITY COMMUNITY. WHERE ARE YOU KNOW A LOT OF CHILDREN DON'T HAVE FOOD TO EAT AND? AND AGAIN THEY WALK RUN WITH SODAS AND POTATO CHIPS I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S REALLY -- A QUALITY DECISION FOR ME IN TERMS OF FREE FEELING CONFIDENT THAT WERE SOLVING THE PROBLEM. AND I'M NOT THERE YET AND I JUST YOU KNOW WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION I DON'T WANT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. BUT I REALLY DO THANK YOU FOR FOR TRYING TO DO THIS YEAH AND I AND I WILL CONTINUE O HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH CAN I LOOK FOR TO IT AND I APPRECIATE YOUR CANDOR AND IN OUR CONVERSATIONS. IF I COULD MISTER CHAIR CREST DR CO FOR TO JUST RESPOND TO THE PART OF THE QUESTION ABOUT. WHY FOCUSING ON SODA AND NOT EVERYTHING ELSE? YES THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR RUBIO WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR THOUGHTFULNESS ABOUT THIS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS THAT THIS IS NOT THERE ONE SINGLE ANSWER SO YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT I THINK YOU AND SENATOR MITCHELL OR OR HITTING A POINT. THIS IS PART OF A BROADER RANGE OF STRATEGIES TO BE ABLE TO TRY TO HELP PEOPLE TO HAVE THE TOOLS AVAILABLE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS AND THAT'S WHY THAT PEDIATRIC STUDY WAS SO IMPORTANT WHEN IT CAME OUT. BECAUSE IT COMPARED NO LABEL TO HAVING TO CLEAR ON CALORIES LABEL TO HAVING THE WARNING LABEL AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT YES SOME PARENTS STILL PURCHASE SUGARY DRINKS THAT'S ALWAYS GOING TO HAPPEN THE KIDS ARE GOING TO CRAVE SUGAR OUR BODIES CRAVE SUGAR SALT AND FAT. THAT S OUR BIOLOGICAL REALITY BUT THE DIFFERENCE THERE IS THAT THE PARENTS AND WERE NO LONGER SAYING -- I THOUGHT THAT WAS RIGHT LIKE THE BEST EXAMPLE THAT I CAN GIVE YOU IS THAT WHEN WE SEND OUT OUR FAX SHE IS A RESEARCHER AT ONE OF THE YOU SEE THAT I WILL NOT NAME WHO DOES SUGAR RESEARCH. WHO RESPONDED BACK TO ME AND SAID YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD INCLUDE THE 1100% FRUIT JUICE BECAUSE THOSE THERE'S DIFFERENT FINANCE ON THAT AND I SAID ACTUALLY THAT'S NOT THOUGH I HEAR PERCENT FRUIT JUICE? THE LABEL IS JUST REALLY DECEPTIVE THAT'S WHY WE NEED OF WARNING LABEL. THIS IS THE PHD WHO STUDY SUGAR ON A REGULAR BASIS WHO COULD NOT DISTINGUISH OUR THE THE ORANGE DRINK JUICE DRINK FROM AN ACTUAL ORANGE JUICE PRODUCT THAT'S TERRIFYING BECAUSE SHE HAS A PHD IN STUDY THIS ON A REGULAR BASIS AND AT FIRST GLANCE COULD NOT TELL THE DIFFERENCE HOW DO WE EXPECT OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO WANT TO DO BETTER. WHO BEEN DIAGNOSE 46% OF OUR POPULATION HAS PRE DIABETES? AND HAVE BEEN TOLD BY A DOCTOR YOU HAVE A CONDITION THAT INCREASES YOUR LIKELIHOOD OF HAVING DIABETES IN YOUR LIFE AND THEY'RE LIKE OKAY I'M I'M GOING TO GET ON TOP OF IT NOW IT'S IT'S A LITTLE LATE IF NOT PRIMARY PREVENTION BUT I'M GONNA GET ON TOP OF IT. NOW AND THEN YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT AND YOU CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CERTAIN PRODUCTS IS THAT YOU'RE SAYING WILL NOT GOING TO CONSUME THE SODAS BUT THIS THIS ARMS YOU DRINK THAT'S JUST RIGHT ITS FRUIT THAT'S NATURAL. AND SO I THINK WITH THE FINANCES SHOWING US THAT THIS IS ONE STRATEGY AND COULD BE A VERY IMPORTANT STRATEGY WHEN PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO MANAGE THEIR HEALTH AND TRYING TO MAKE BETTER DECISIONS AND THE LAST THING WE% LIKE TO SEE IS. SOMEBODY RYING AND FAILING BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE INFORMATION OUR HEALTH LITERACY IS INCREDIBLY LOW AND SO THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY THE ICON IS THERE SO THAT YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO KNOW TO READ WE CAN STILL MESSAGE THIS AND THERE CAN BE A PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN. AROUND WHAT THAT ICON MEANS AND WHY BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE REALLY ARE UNCLEAR THAT ONE DRINK A DAY ONE JUST ONE INCREASES YOUR LIKELIHOOD OF DIABETES BY 27% THAT'S TERRIFYING. THANK YOU THANK YOU -- MAKE ANOTHER STATEMENT IF I MAY AB BRIEFLY AND THEN OF THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE OTHER PEOPLE IN LINE SO. SERVE CONTINUATION OF YOUR VERY BRIEFLY QUICKLY AND AGAIN I DON'T DOUBT DISCOUNT ANYTHING YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE IT'S VALID AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. BUT I ALSO DID A LITTLE BIT MORE TAKING A RESURGENT AND I FOUND THAT WITHIN THE SAME PERIOD OF TIME. I BELIEVE DIABETES INCREASE 30% BUT YET TRICKERY CONSUMPTION I'M SORRY SIR HE DRINKS CONSUMPTION DECREASED ABOUT 10%. AND SO THERE'S A DISPARITY BETWEEN THE INCREASE IN DIABETES AND AND THE USE OF SURGERY DURING SO I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT I GOING TO SAY YES. YEAH ALL INFORMED AND SO I DON'T DISCOUNT YOUR STATE AND THERE IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A TIME LAG JUST PUTTING ON A MINUTE BUT IN YALA JUST BY TRAINING THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE A TIME LAG BETWEEN. THE TIME THAT YOU START SOMETHING AND WHEN YOU SEE THE FOR THE WHEN YOU SEE THE DECLINE ALSO SOMETIMES IT DEPENDS ON HOW SUGARY DRINKS OR TO FIND BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN A DECLINE IN THE SUGARY DRINKS THAT HAVE BEEN REGULATED IN SCHOOLS AND THINGS. BUT ONE OF THE CAR ABOUT THAT WE INCLUDED WERE THINGS LIKE GATORADE IN OTHER SPORTS AND ENERGY DRINKS AND THEY HAVE AS MUCH OF MORE IF NOT MORE SUGAR THAN SOME OF THE PRODUCTS THAT WERE BANNED FROM SCHOOLS. AND SO WE SAW A MAJOR INCREASE ESPECIALLY IN CHILDREN TWO TO FIVE AND CONSUMING BILLS SO WHEN WE SAY SUGARY DRINKS IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN WE START LOOKING AT RESEARCH TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'VE. COMPLETELY INCLUDED THE ENTIRE BROAD CATEGORY BECAUSE WE SOMETIMES THAN A SHIFT FROM ONE TYPE OF SUGARY DRINKS TO ANOTHER TYPE OF SUGARY DRINK. ALL RIGHT CENTER LEYVA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SENATOR MONNING I REALLY REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR PASSION FOR THIS ISSUE I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT YOU ARE WORKING WITH THE TEAMSTERS BECAUSE WE DO KNOW THAT THEY REPRESENT A LOT OF THESE FOLKS AND THAT THEY ARE GOOD UNION JOBS. AND I HAVE TO SAY -- FOR SOME MY COLLEAGUES THAT ARE NEW HERE I DID NOT SUPPORT YOUR BILL THE LAST TIME AROUND WHAT CHANGED MY MIND WAS WHEN I WAS SHOPPING AT MY LOCAL GROCERY STORE. AND YOU HAVE THE SODA AISLE AND EVERYBODY KIND OF KNOWS IT SO DOES A PROBLEM. BUT THEN ONE I'LL OVER THE ENTIRE FILE ON BOTH SIDES WAS VITAMIN WATER WAS GATORADE WAS -- ICED TEA FLAVORED ICE TEA. AND WHEN YOU CHECK ALL OF THOSE DRINKS THEY ALL HAVE MORE SUGAR SOMETIMES THAN SODA. AND IT GOT ME TO THINKING ABOUT A BILL WE JUST VOTED ON HERE SURE -- A LITTLE WHILE AGO. THE INDUSTRY SEEMS AS TOBACCO IS MOVING FROM CIGARETTES TO VAPING IT SEEMS THAT THE INDUSTRY IS MOVING FROM SODA. TO THESE DRINKS. YES YES THE MOVING TO THESE DRINKS THAT WE THINK ARE HEALTHY AND ARE GOOD FOR US VITAMIN WATERS HORRIBLE WHEN MY GIRLS WERE YOUNGER AND WANT TO DRINK AND I'M LIKE NOW -- SO I I AM HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL. I DO AGREE IN EDUCATION WE HAVE TO EDUCATE MORE WHEN I WAS PREGNANT WITH OUR TWINS -- MY JUST DASCHLE DIABETES WAS OFF THE CHARTS BUT MY AWESOME DOCTOR INSTEAD OF PUTTING ME ON INSULIN SAID LET'S SEE WHAT YOU'RE EATING SO HE MADE ME RECORD ALL OF WHAT ALL OF MY FOOD FOR A WEEK. WELL WHO KNEW A MINUTE BIG FORGIVENESS BECAUSE I WAS ONLY TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD. AND WHO KNEW I WOULD I USED TO DRINK A SIX PACK OF DR PEPPER DAY. I KNOW TERRIBLE RIGHT AND THEN WHEN I GOT PREGNANT I WANT TO DO RIGHT BY THESE LITTLE PEOPLE INSIDE ME SO I SWITCHED TO FRUIT JUICE AND I WAS DRINKING THIS HUGE THING OF FRUIT JUICE EVERY DAY. AND THE DOCTOR SAID IF YOU CUT THAT OUT AND SWITCHED TO WATER WE WON'T HAVE TO PUT YOU ON INSULIN AND GUESS WHAT IT WORKED LIKE A CHARM. BUT I DID NOT KNOW UNTIL I WAS EDUCATED SO WE NEED TO EDUCATE OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE NOT SO YOUNG PEOPLE AND I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER STONE. THANK YOU MISTER A SENATOR MONNING I JUST I WANNA JUST TO ALWAYS COMPLIMENT YOU BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN A STALLWORTH -- ADVOCATE FOR REDUCING SHOT IT'LL BE IS TO BE CITY I HAVEN'T SUPPORTED -- THESE THESE SURGERY LABOR LAYING HER TAXING BILLS THAT YOU'VE DONE IT DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T RESPECT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO -- I JUST BELIEVE THAT -- WE NEED TO HAVE A MORE -- BROAD -- VIEW POINT ON WHAT CAUSES CHILDHOOD OBESITY CERTAINLY -- CONSUMPTION OF SUGAR IS IS ONE COMPONENT -- BUT DRINKING SUGARY -- LIQUIDS IS NOT A NEW PHENOMENON I MEAN I'D LOVE TO SURE YOU DRINKS WHEN I WAS GROWING UP -- MY PARENTS WERE LOW INCOME THEY COULDN'T AFFORD TO BUY MILK CITIES TO BUY WINE COUNTRY CONCENTRATE NOW IS OUR MILK UNFORTUNATELY. THAT'S HOW ANYTHING'S WORK -- WE HAD COKE -- WE HAD. SEE WE HAD SEVEN UP -- BUT ONE THING THAT -- WE HAD WHEN I WAS GROWING UP THAT WE JUST DON'T SEE TODAY IS -- WE DID HAVE A SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE WHEN I WAS GROWING UP WE HAD ACTIVE RECREATION IN OUR SCHOOLS. YOU KNOW RE DRESSED OUT YOU KNOW WE WE DID WE DID TRACK WE DID BASKETBALL WE DID FOOTBALL. I PLAYED. WARNER FOOTBALL I PLAYED -- BASEBALL I OF I AM IN HIGH SCHOOL I PLAYED VARSITY FOOTBALL VARSITY TENNIS A. B. YOU'RE ALWAYS ACTIVE. TODAY WITH OUR COMPUTERS AND COMPUTER GAMES OUR KIDS ARE SEDENTARY ENOUGH NOT BURNING THE CALORIES IN A CONSUMING CALORIES THE NET RESULT IS EVER GONNA HAVE A CHILDHOOD OBESITY. AND AN ADULT OBESITY PROBLEM -- SO -- I HOPE THAT THERE'S A WAY WE CAN CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION. AND AND RETURNED OP ACTIVE RECREATION INTO OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM TO GET THESE KIDS -- TO BURNS CALORIES AND TO GIVE THEM BETTER CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH WHICH EXERCISE CERTAINLY WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THAT. ONLY QUESTION I'M GOING TO HAVE FOR YOU SIR AND AGAIN ABOUT THE WHAT WILL COURT WITH GREAT RESPECT FOR WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO -- THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO -- DID LABELING AND THEY WERE SUED AND THE JUDGES FOUND THAT -- THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUES AND IF THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE AMOUNT OF SPACE -- I GUESS THAT THE THE LABELS TAKING UP. BUT JUDGE -- COULD -- WROTE THIS WARNING DOES NOT PROVIDE PURELY FACTUAL NON CONTROVERSIAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE TERMS UNDER WHICH SERVICES WILL BE AVAILABLE AMONG OTHER THINGS THE WARNING IS CONTRARY TO THE STATEMENT BY THE FDA THAT. ADDED SUGARS ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS SAFE I WAS WONDERING IF IF THE LEGISLATURE DOES PASS THIS -- WHAT IS THE AND YOUR LAWYER -- WHAT IS THE PRESIDENT'S OF THIS DECISION WILL MAKE ON WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE IN THE STATE GREAT QUESTION I'M FAMILIAR WITH THAT CASE IN THAT DECISION? THAT ELATED TO ADVERTISING ON BILLBOARDS AND BUSES NOT PRODUCT LABELING IT WAS ADVERTISING OF A PRODUCT. THE COURT OF APPEALS AS YOU JUST READ FROM. THOUGHT THAT THE WARNING LABEL TOOK UP TO LARGEST SPACE INTERFERING WITH THE FIRST AMENDMENT FREE SPEECH RIGHT OF THE ADVERTISER. MORE IN ANOTHER CATEGORY OF A PRODUCT SAFETY WARNING LABEL ON THE PRODUCT THAT THE PERSON'S ABOUT TO CONSUME. WE ALSO DON'T TAKE UP. 20% OF THE SPACE WE THINK WARRANT DEFENDABLE TERRITORY ON THAT BUT I APPRECIATE -- DOCTOR CO FOR ME WANT TO ADD TO THAT SHE'S BEEN INVOLVED WITH THAT CASE THANKS FOR THE CLARIFICATION ABSOLUTELY YES THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SO THE THERE WAS A JUDGE ON THE JDGE'S OPINION ON IT AND WHAT THEY TALKED ABOUT WAS WHETHER OR NOT SOME OF THE WORDING. IN THEIR BILL -- WOULD PASS BE I THINK A CAUGHT PURELY FACTUAL ON ON A CONTROVERSIAL TEST AND THERE WERE THINGS THAT SHE DIFFERENT THAN OURS THE BASE BUT USE THE NEAR TERM DIABETES OUR LABEL SAYS TYPE TWO DIABETES THAT'S ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THE INCLUDED BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT TYPE ONE IT'S AN AUTO. IMMUNE DISEASE AND IT'S NOT CAUSED BY YOU KNOW LIFESTYLE FACTORS SO THAT'S THAT'S ONE DISTINCTION FROM THEIR BILL IN HOURS THE OTHER IS THAT OUR BILL SIMILAR TO TOBACCO AND ALCOHOL WARNINGS. THIS MAY CONTRIBUTE AS OPPOSED TO CONTRIBUTE BECAUSE THAT IS THAT IS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE BODY OF EVIDENCE THAT WE HAVE SO THOSE ARE TWO OF THE THINGS THAT THE JUDGES -- JUST SAID COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE THE PURELY FACTUAL AND NCONTROVERSIAL -- TO COME UP AND POSSIBLY BE QUESTIONED AND SO THOSE ARE NOT CONSIDERATIONS FOR OUR BILL SIMILAR -- TO WITH SENATOR MINING SAID IN TERMS OF THE SIZE DIFFERENCE AND JUST OVERALL WERE UNDER A DIFFERENT SET OF RULES BECAUSE THIS PRODUCT VERSES I'M GENERAL ADVERTISING. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THOSE PERFECTLY [inaudible] OKAY. RIGHT TO THE SCENE OF THE QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS I DID HAVE A FEW OF MY OWN -- AND I AGAIN CEREMONY ON THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING YOU'VE WORKED VERY HARD ON BUT BECAUSE YOUR PASSION TO BE SURE WE PROTECT. PEOPLE CALIFORNIA FROM -- THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF OF OF THESE BEVERAGES. PERHAPS HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU DOCTOR I THINK I KNOW WHAT THE ANSWERS BUT YOU CAN ACT -- CORRECT ME ARE PERHAPS YOU CAN JUST ANSWER IT AND WE'LL SEE WHETHER YOU AGREE -- SO. WHEN THE BIG CONCERNS OF COURSES DIABETES AND -- IN GENERAL OF PEOPLE UNDERSTAND IS THAT YOU KNOW OF BEING OBESE IS A RISK FACTOR FOR TYPE TWO DIABETES. AND WE WANT TO TRY REDUCE TO BE SAYING THAT I APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSION ABOUT WELL THERE'S IT'S AT GNATS MULTIFACTORIAL. ANSWER ANY TYPE TWO DIABETES MULTIFACTORIAL BUT I I GUESS WHAT I WANT MAYBE YOU CAN EXPECT THAT TELL ME WHAT THE RESEARCH SHOWS IN TERMS OF TYPE TWO DIABETES ITSELF NOW OBESITY IS A RISK FACTOR IN ITSELF BUT WHAT IS THE UNIQUE ROLE SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES PLAY. AT THE IN TERMS OF PARTICULARLY AROUND DIABETES AND METABOLIC SYNDROME -- IS IT IS IT IS IT MERELY BECAUSE IT CAUSES OBESITY IN THAT FIGURES TYPE TO OR DOES IT HAVE A PARTICULARLY. AFFECT BEYOND JUST OBESITY IN ITSELF YES EVEN WHEN THEY CRUISE CONTROL -- FOR OBESITY THERE STILL IS AN INDEPENDENT IMPACT AND THEN IT THE PART -- THOUGHT TO BE BECAUSE OF THE WAY IN WHICH THE SUGARY DRINKS ARE ABSORBED IN THEIR ABSORB MUCH FASTER THAN CONSUMING THE CONSUMING THE SUGAR AND FOOD. BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY DONE CLINICAL RESEARCH LOOKING AT SUGAR IN FOOD AND COMPARING IT TO LIQUID SUGAR WE FOCUS A LOT OF OUR ATTENTION AND SO WHEN WHEN THE QUESTION COMES UP OF SHOULD BE BE YOU TO LABELING OTHER PRODUCTS AND OTHER. THINGS LIKE THAT YOU KNOW AS A SCIENCE BASED ORGANIZATION OUR ANSWER WOULD BE. MAYBE IN THE FUTURE ONCE WE STUDY IT BUT WE WOULDN'T WANT TO DO SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T THE FINANCE TO BACK UP AND RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THE SCIENCE TO BACK THIS UP -- AND SO THAT'S WHY YOU START THERE I WOULD I WOULD NEVER WANT TO LABEL IT FOR A PRODUCT RIGHT LIKE I COULD I WOULD HAVE TO COME UP HERE TO POST MY OWN BILL IF WE WERE STARTING THE LABEL OTHER THINGS. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA TO REALLY SHOW THAT HAS THE SAME IMPACT WE HAVE SOME THEORIES AND SOME INFERENCES WE DON'T HAVE THOSE DATA BUT THE SUGAR THE SUGARY DRINKS WE SEE INDEPENDENT OF THE OBESITY. BBC AS AN ADDITIVE FACTOR -- AND SO IT'S MOUNT MULTI FACTOR ON THAT WAY AND IT THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR MAKING THAT POINT BECAUSE THAT'S CERTAINLY WHAT I ALSO HEAR PHONE I'VE TALKED TO IS A PEDIATRICIAN TALKING SO MY COLLEAGUES WHO ARE. PH AGAIN COLLEGES WHO ARE STUDYING THIS ISSUE SO I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE -- PEOPLE TO ABOUT WELLS SUGARS THE PROBLEM SHOULD THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT'S TRUE. SUGAR GETS ADDED TO A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS -- BUT SUGAR THAT'S BEING CONSUMED IN LIQUID FORM. HAS AN EFFECT BEYOND SIMPLY JUST THE WHAT'S MORE CALORIES AND NOW PEOPLE ARE GETTING. HAVE YOU HEARD TO GETTING MORE OF THESE AND THAT'S WHAT'S TRIGGERING IT THERE'S AN AN ADDITIONAL FACT RELATED. TO HOW FAST AND HOW HOW QUICKLY IT STIMULATES THE CANCELING SYSTEM THAT THE REACTION I DON'T GET TO TECHNICAL HERE BUT ANY ANYTHING. TO ME THAT IS WHY -- THIS PARTICULAR BILL AND THIS PARTICULAR APPROACH IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD DEFINITELY BE CONSIDERING AND I APPRECIATE -- CEREMONY YOU YOU YOU POINT OUT THAT JUST CAME OUT -- THE JOINT STATEMENT FROM AMERICAN CAT PEDIATRICS AND AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION -- WHICH A REVIEW THE RESEARCH AND AND AND AND I THINK THAT -- CERTAINLY YES IT IS WE NEED TO DO OTHER THINGS WE NEED TO LOOK AT BUILT ENVIRONMENTS WE NEED TO DO EXERCISE -- YOU KNOW WE NEED TO LOOK OVER OVERALL CALORIC INTAKE -- WHICH THEN CAN TRIGGER OF THE CITY -- SO BUT I THINK WE CAN'T. IGNORE THE PARTICULAR ROLE OF CONSUMPTION OF SUGAR IN THIS PARTICULAR FORM I WOULD POINT OUT THAT DAY -- THAT -- I BELIEVE IF YOU DRINK ONE CAN OF ONE STANDARD CAN OF SODA OR SOME EQUIVALENT OF THAT EACH DAY -- THAT. IS EQUAL TO GAINING FIVE POUNDS IF YOU DO THIS EVERY DAY FOR A YEAR THAT'S FIVE POUNDS OF THINK ABOUT TEENAGER HOODS DOING DRINKING ONE CAN OF SODA. BETWEEN AGE THIRTEEN TWO H.. EIGHTEEN RIGHT AND THEN AND THEN THE YOU CAN ACTUALLY ACTUALLY STOP AT AGE EIGHTEEN RIGHT SO THAT'S FIVE POUNDS EXTERNAL MAYBE THEY COULD EXERCISE THAT OFF BUT YOU JUST ADD THAT IN THE MEASURE THEY DRINK TOO NOW IT'S TEN POUNDS A YEAR RIGHT. SO THAT'S FIFTY EXTRA POUNDS SOMEONE WOULD HAVE GAINED THAT THEY COULD HAVE AVOIDED BUT THEN A SCAN IS THE APPOINTED AS YOU POINTED OUT IT'S BEYOND JUST SIMPLY THE ADDITION OF THE WEIGHT ITSELF. SO -- SO I THINK YOU KNOW CERTAINLY -- WE WANT TO BE SURE PEOPLE HAVE THE INFORMATION SO PARENTS CAN MAKE THE CHOICES -- AYE YE I ALSO THINK A AND I I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN ABOUT -- THAT PEOPLE HAVE WELL WHAT HAPPENS IF PEOPLE STOP DRINKING NAME WELL MY GUESS IS PEOPLE ARE STILL THIRSTY AND ARE STILL LOOKING. FOR DRINKS THAT THEY WANT TO DRINK -- ACTUALLY THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF COCA COLA SAID THAT HIS BIGGEST COMPETITIONS ATER -- YOU RECKON AND EFFECTIVE MOVED INTO THE WATER SPACE THEN THEY MOVED IN TREAT I THINK I'VE SEEN AS A COUPLE CALL A BRAND. SO -- AND I'M NOT ADVERTISING OR ANYBODY HERE -- BUT I I THINK THAT CERTAINLY WE WANT TO HELP THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY TO ACTUALLY -- BE ABLE TO TO TO MAKE SALES ONE TO SELL THINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN DRINK BUT WE ALSO WANT TO BE SURE. THAT -- HOPEFULLY AND I AN INCIDENT THE INDUSTRY HOPEFULLY IS ALSO THINKING ABOUT WHAT CAN WE DIRECT PEOPLE TOWARD THAT IS GOING TO BE HEALTHIER. AND WE SHOULD CERTAINLY INFORM CONSUMERS ABOUT THAT -- SO -- THAT IF THERE'S NO OTHER QUESTIONS IS OUR MOTION ON THE BILL AND THE PERSON TO FILL CENTER MONEY WHICH LIKE THE CLOTHES. WELL. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE THOUGHTFUL CONSIDERATION -- INFORMED AND RESPECTFUL CONVERSATION. YOU ALLUDED TO THE RECENT REPORT AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION THERE'S A REASON THEY ARE FOCUSING ON SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES. I'M THE FIRST TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE MULTI FACTORIAL ISSUES OF SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE. BUT TO BURN THE CALORIES IN ONE TWENTY FLUID OUNCE BOTTLE -- YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BRING THAT OFTEN IN GYM CLASS A YEAR AFTER RUN A HALF MARATHON -- MARATHON AND WE HAVE. WHEN I WAS YOUNGER AND I'LL SHOW MY AGE? THE BOTTLES WERE EIGHT OUNCES THEN TEN OUNCES AND TWELVE OUNCES THIS TWENTY FLUID OUNCE BOTTLE IS WHAT IS NOW THE STANDARD SIZE IN THE VENDING MACHINE WITH THE EQUIVALENT OF SIXTEEN TEASPOONS OF SUGAR -- THIS IS FOR OUR CHILDREN AND DRINKING AND PARENTS ARE BUYING THE TWO LITER BOTTLES BECAUSE THEY'RE IN A MARKET. AND THE COSTS LESS THAN AN EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF WATER OR MILK SO IF YOU'RE ON A FIXED INCOME. IF YOU'RE LIVING IN POVERTY AND IF YOU'RE TRYING TO STOCK YOUR KITCHEN PEOPLE ARE BUYING TWO LITER BOTTLES THAT ARE SUBSIDIZED NOW IN TERMS OF THE SALES PRICE. BY THE MANUFACTURE. LIKE THE TOBACCO PRODUCT TO GET FAMILIES HOOKED INDEPENDENT AND THEN THE PRICE GETS RAISED. SO BECOME SOUNDS STAPLE OF THE DIET. BREAKFAST LUNCH AND DINNER NOT A WEEKEND TREAT.

OF PUBLIC HEALTH DURING AN INSPECTION CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA LABOR CODE EMPLOYEES ARE ALLOWED TO DISCUSS SAFETY AND HEALTH VIOLATIONS WITH A CAL OSHA.

RATHER THAN AN ANONYMOUS COMPLAINT CURRENTLY A WORKER CAN CALL DPH AN IMPORTANT ISSUE WHICH OFTEN RESULTS IN A SURPRISE HOSPITAL INSPECTION OR UNDER SENATOR RADFORD'S BILL THEY CAN REPORT THE SAFETY CONCERNS CONFIDENTIALLY WHEN A DPH INSPECTORS ALREADY ON SITE FOR AN INSPECTION. THIS BILL DOES NOT CREATE NEW WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS HEALTHCARE WORKERS ARE ALREADY PROTECTED UNDER THE LAW FROM RETALIATION FOR REPORTING PATIENT SAFETY CONCERNS OR PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES. IT THEREFORE MAKES SENSE TO FURTHER FACILITATE PROTECTING THESE WORKERS BY ALLOWING THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK PRIVATELY WITH AN INSPECTOR FROM DPH ALL RIGHT WHICH HAS SENATOR BRADFORD SAID THEY ALREADY HAVE WITH THE STATE INSPECTOR FROM CAL OSHA.
