BUT TODAY WE ONLY HAVE ONE BILL IN TODAY'S AGENDA THAT'S AB EIGHT SIXTY BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER MARC BERMAN THE ESTEEM CHAIROF THE ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS AND- ELECTIONS COMMITTEE AS YOU CAN SEE I'M ALSO COR THIRD QUARTER THIS MEASURE- BEFORE WE HERE MISTER BERMAN'S PRESENTATION THE BILL LET'S ESTABLISH KERR WE ALREADY DONE THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT. CORN IS BEEN A STABLE AND NOW LET'S HEAR FROM THE AUTHOR ON AB EIGHT SIXTY SEVEN MEMBER BERMAN THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. THANK YOU NUMBER IN COLLEAGUES AND REALLY APPRECIATE EVERYBODY COMING TOGETHER- JUST THIS ONE BILL AND THIS REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO RISK THEIR HEALTH AND POSSIBLY THEIR LIFE. TO EXERCISE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO VOTE. I HOPE WE CAN ALL AGREE WITH THAT STATEMENT. YEAH THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE SAW ON APRIL SEVENTH OF THIS YEAR WHEN WISCONSINITES WERE FORCED TO VOTE IN PERSON IN THEIR PRIMARY ELECTION AND- STAY FOR HOURS IN LINES THAT STRETCH FOR MILES. IN THE MIDDLE OF A DEADLY HEALTH PANDEMICS AMERICAN CITIZENS YOUNG AND OLD. WERE DENIED THE ABILITY TO VOTE BY MAIL AND WERE FORCED TO LEAVE THE SAFETY OF THEIR HOMES TO VOTE IN PERSON. DESPITE THE BEST EFFORTS OF ELECTIONS OFFICIALS. THOUSANDS OF VOTERS TO REQUEST AN ABSENTEE BALLOTS DID NOT RECEIVE THEM IN TIME TO VOTE AND RETURN THEM BY ELECTION DAY. THEY WERE EFFECTIVELY DISENFRANCHISED IN THE AFTERMATH OF WISCONSIN'S ELECTION IS BECOME CLEAR THAT THE HEALTH CONCERNS OF FORCING PEOPLE INTO IN PERSON VOTING DURING A PANDEMIC ARE ALL TOO REAL AN ANALYSIS BY THE WISCONSIN DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES FOUND THAT AT LEAST SEVENTY ONE PEOPLE TRACK TO THE COVER NINETEEN VIRUS AFTER VOTING IN PERSON OR WORKING AT THE POLLS AT THE APRIL ELECTION. SO ONCE AGAIN. VOTER SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RISK THEIR HEALTH. AND POSSIBLY THEIR LIFE IN ORDER TO EXERCISE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO VOTE. THIS IS ONE OF INTRODUCED AB EIGHT SIXTY WOULD REQUIRE THAT EVERY REGISTERED CALIFORNIA VOTER EMAIL THE BALLOT FOR THIS NOVEMBER'S GENERAL ELECTION. THIS WILL ENSURE THAT EVERY THAT EVERY CALIFORNIA VOTER HAS THE ABILITY TO VOTE FROM THE SAFETY OF THEIR OWN HOME. UNFORTUNATELY OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL HAVE ARGUED THAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO MAIL BALLOTS TO INACTIVE VOTE THIS THIS OBVIOUSLY IS NOT TRUE. ELECTIONS CODE SECTION TWO TWO pINACTIVE VOTERS DO NOT RECEIVE ELECTION MATERIALS WHICH INCLUDES BALLOTS. FURTHERMORE THE LANGUAGE OF THIS BILL IS MODELED AFTER LANGUAGE IN EXISTING LAW THAT GOVERNS ELECTIONS CONDUCTED UNDER THE VOTERS CHOICE ACT MAIL BALLOT ELECTIONS AND ALL MAIL BALLOT PRECINCTS. NONE OF THOSE LAWS HAVE BEEN INTERPRETED TO REQUIRE MAILING BALLOTS TO AN ACTIVE VOTERS. TO EVEN THOUGH I FEEL A LITTLE BIT SILLY HAVING TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS BILL CLEARLY REQUIRES BALLOTS TO BE MAILED ONLY TO ACTIVE REGISTERED VOTERS I WANT TO MAKE THAT MEAN ESPECIALLY CLEAR ON THE RECORD TO HELP DISPEL THE RUMORS THAT ARE BEING PERPETRATED. PERPETUATED BY GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS WHO SEEK TO UNDERMINE CALIFORNIANS FAITH IN THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTIONS. I ALSO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT EIGHTY EIGHT SIXTY WOULD NOT ELIMINATE IN IN VOTING UP. TELL WILL NEED SAFE IN SOME VOTING. THIS NOVEMBER BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY NEVER RECEIVED A BALLOT. THE LOSS OR DAMAGE THE BALLOT THEY NEED LANGUAGE OR VOTING ASSISTANCE OR THEY NEED TO REGISTER TO VOTE. TO OWN IT THANK YOU- CHAIR ON BERG FOR HIS LEADERSHIP. IN OFFERING SB FOUR TWENTY THREE THE BILL THAT I AM PROUD TO JOINTLY AUTHOR. TO ENSURE THAT SAFE AND HEALTHY IN PERSON VOTING OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE SO THAT ALL VOTERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO VOTE PRIVATELY. AND INDEPENDENTLY. FINALLY AB EIGHT SIXTY MAKES A NUMBER OF OTHER IMPORTANT ACCOMMODATIONS TO HELP FACILITATE THE EXPECTED SURGE IN VOTING BY MAIL. AT THIS NOVEMBER'S ELECTION. IT ALLOWS COUNTIES TO BEGIN PROCESSING RETURN VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS EARLIER. SO THAT THEY CAN BETTER MANAGE THEIR WORKLOADS AND GET MORE BALLOTS COUNT ON ELECTION NIGHT. IT EXTENDS THE DEADLINE FOR SEE THE VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS TODAY VOTERS ARE NOT DISENFRANCHISED BY ANY POTENTIAL POSTAL SERVICE DELAYS. IT ALLOWS ALL VOTERS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FLEXIBILITY OFFERED BY REMOTE ACCESSIBLE VOTE BY MAIL SYSTEMS WHICH CAN BE ESPECIALLY HELPFUL FOR VOTERS WHO NEED REPLACEMENT BALLOTS OR WHO WANT TO RECEIVE A BALLOT IN THEIR PREFERRED LANGUAGE. FINALLY AB EIGHT SIXTY WOULD ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIA VOTERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO TRACK THEIR BALLOTS. AS THEY MOVE THROUGH THE MAIL SYSTEM AND ARE PROCESSED BY ELECTIONS OFFICIALS. THAT WOULD BE REMISS. POINT THAT WAS BROUGHT UP IN A LETTER OF OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. IT'S OPPOSITION LETTER. THE ELECTION INTO THE ELECTION INTEGRITY PROJECT STATES AND I QUOTE IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE TO LOOK TO THE VOTE BY MAIL PROCESS TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF VOTERS TO PARTICIPATE. IN AN ELECTION WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING THEIR THEIR HEALTH OR SAFETY AND THE TIME A PANDEMIC THREAT. BUT TO MAINTAIN ELECTORAL INTEGRITY THERE MUST BE EXTRA EFFORT EXPENDED TOWARD SHORE THAT VOTE JEWISH TO ASSURE THE VOTERS. THAT THE QUEUE WERE IS NOT MORE LETHAL THAN THE DISEASE. I FIND THAT ARGUMENT TO BE INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE AND IN POOR TASTE. VOTING BY MAIL HAS NEVER BECAUSE ANYONE'S HOSPITALIZATION OR DEATH. BUT GIVEN THE COVERT INETEEN HEALTH PANDEMIC IN UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE WILL BE A SURGEON CASES RIGHT BEFORE THE GENERAL ELECTION. THERE'S A VERY REAL CHANCE THAT A LACK OF THAT A LACK OF ACCESS. TO VOTING BY MAIL OR BY FORCING VOTERS INTO CROWDED POLLING BOOTH. WARS OR WILL RESULT IN BOTH HOSPITALIZATION AND- PASS I THINK THAT ARGUMENT IS BEYOND THE PALE. AB EIGHT SIXTY SUPPORT BY A LONG LIST OF ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING DIVERSE COMMUNITIES INCLUDING THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA AT THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ALLIANCE AND THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS AS WELL AS BY SECRETARY OF STATE. ALEX PADILLA THANK YOU MEMBERS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU SENATORS FOR CONSIDERATION. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND TESTIFYING TODAY IS ROBBIE AVALON OFF FROM THE OFFICE OF SECRETARY OF STATE ALEX BUT THE- THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN- FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE FORWARD THIS IS A INCREDIBLY CRITICAL ELECTION. AND THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF CALIFORNIA'S VOTERS IS COURSE PARAMOUNT SO APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. BOB DUE TO CONSTRAINTS REGARDING THE LENGTH OF HEARINGS TECHNOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS AND NEW CLEANING PROTOCOLS COMMITTEES WILL INSTITUTE TIME LIMITS ON TESTIMONY THAT'S ROCK COMMITTEES. CURRENTLY EACH SIDE WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TOTAL OF THREE MINUTES THAT'S FOR THE- FOLKS WHO ARE THE PRIMARY POLICY AND PROPONENTS. FIVE MUST MEET THE COMMON SUIT THEIR NAME.

I'M ROBERT AVALON ON BEHALF OF SECRETARY OF STATE ALEX YEAH AND HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AB EIGHT SIXTY ONE SURE EVERY VOTER IS ABLE TO CAST A BALLOT DURING- THE PANDEMIC IN A SAFE MANNER. THIS BILL DOES NOT ELIMINATE IN PERSON VOTING AT OPTION WILL STILL BE AVAILABLE AND NOVEMBER. FOR THE UPCOMING ELECTION. ROUGHLY 87% OF THAT TWENTY POINT SIX SIX MILLION REGISTERED VOTERS. WILL ALREADY BE RECEIVING A BALLOT IN THE MAIL. AB EIGHT SIXTY PROVIDES THAT THE REMAINING VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA THE BILL BY MAIL BALLOT. ALLOW MORE CALIFORNIA VOTERS TO HAVE THE OPTION TO BOTH SAFELY IN THEIR HOMES SO THAT VOTERS DO NOT HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE. THE HEALTH. ALLOWS THEM TO DO BOTH. ANOTHER ASPECT OF THE BILL ALLOW COUNTY STOP FOR THE BALLOT TRACKING FOR VOTERS WHICH ARE AGENCY CURRENTLY OFFERS THE COUNTY. NO COST THE COUNTIES TO PARTICIPATE IN THE BALLOT TRACK SYSTEM IN WHICH A MAJORITY OF COUNTY IS ALREADY PARTICIPATING. AS WELL OUT OF ORDERS TO HAVE AN OPTION TO SEE THE LOCATION OF THE BALLOT IN THE MAILING PROCESS SIMILAR TO HOW. YOU CAN TRACK A PACKAGE IN THE MAIL. ANOTHER ASPECT OF THE BILL WILL ALLOW COUNTIES TO OFFER. REMOTE ACCESSIBLE THE BILL BY MAIL TO AVAILABLE. TO MAKE AVAILABLE TO ALL THE OTHERS.

INDICATING THAT- ANYTHING ABOUT EQUALITY THERE WE WERE SIMPLY TRYING TO SHOW THAT THERE ARE SOME MAJOR RISK OF A BLANKET VOTE BY MAIL POLICY OUT WE HAVE CHAOS AND UNRELIABILITY IN OUR STATE VOTER ROLLS ARE DATED AND NOW FIFTEEN IT'S PROVEN THAT YOU AND I. TURN THE NUMBERS INTO YOU THEY'VE BEEN SHARED WITH SECRETARY OF STATE THEY'VE BEEN SHARED IN MEDIA RELEASES ON OUR DATA ARE COMPLETELY ACCURATE AND VERY CONSERVATIVE AS WELL TO THE PROBLEM MAY BE GREAT DEAL LARGER THAN OUR- DATA. REALLY SHOW. WE BELIEVE THAT WOULD BE A REAL PROBLEM TO STAND VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT OUT TO THE ENTIRE VOTER ROLE WE HAVE THIRTEEN COUNTIES THAT HAVE OVER 1100% OF THEIR ELIGIBLE POPULATION NUMBERS REGISTERED TO VOTE MEDICAL. AFFAIRS COUNTY THE LARGEST. COUNTY THE ENTIRE NATION AND LARGE THAN FOR TO STAY. AND THEY HAVE A 114% OF THEIR ELIGIBLE POPULATION REGISTERED TO VOTE AND TWENTY SEVEN MORE. COUNTY HAVE AN UNREALISTIC VOTER REGISTRATION OF OVER NINETY PERCENT. SO ALL IN ALL OUR CONSERVATIVE DATA SHOW THAT WE HAVE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT THOUSND PEOPLE STILL ON THE ACTIVE LIST. WHO ARE LIKELY TO SEE OR HAVE BEEN RELOCATED TO OTHER STATE AND THEY'VE NOT BEEN REMOVED TO THE INACTIVE LIST AND THEY SHOULD NOT BE FOUND. A BALLOT UNLESS THEY REQUEST IT THE CALIFORNIA ALREADY. 75% OF THE POPULAR BUT VOTING POPULATION. WELL AS- CAN CERTAIN BE TRUSTED TO KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A HEALTH ISSUE AND A HEALTH CONCERN AND ANYTIME BETWEEN NOW TODAY AND SEVEN DAYS BEFORE ELECTION DAY WITH A PHONE CALL THEY CAN REQUEST THAT VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT AND REMAIN SAFELY IN THEIR HOMES AND CAST THE SAFE BLLOT BUT THAT THE DECISION SHOULD BE UP TO THEM SINCE THEY ARE THE ONE WHO HAS HAD NOT OTHERWISE QUESTION TWO WHERE SHE VOTE BY BALLOT. IF YOU IF WE SEND TO EVERYBODY IN THE STATE REGARDLESS OF REQUEST NOT WE ARE GOING TO BE SENT OUT A LARGE NUMBER OF BALLOTS THAT ARE GOING TO GO TO PEOPLE WHO ARE NO LONGER THERE SO WHAT WHAT ASKING ARE PERMANENT VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT VOTERS I MEAN RATHER NON PERMANENT BUT MY MOM BUT VOTERS TO TAKE. HEALTH PATIENT AND PICK UP ON IT THAT'S NOT THE QUESTION IT AND WENT THREE BUT WHAT YOU VOTERS THE PRO IS SAID THE VOTE THE LEGIT OWNERS NOT HOT. WELL THEY LIVED IN. COULD GET INTO THAT GEN. ACTION RESULT IT WOULD FLOOD TELL. WITH OF BALLOTS IN DA THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW LONGER THERE. AND THE WE THERE ARE GOING. BE FOR OPPORTUNITY AND FRAUD.

AND THERE ARE NO OTHERS IN OPPOSITION WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM MODERATOR APPRECIATE YOUR HELP. ALL RIGHT- LET'S NOW TURN TO THE DYESS- I KNOW THAT THE SEVERAL SENATOR. THE CENTER NIELSEN ASKED EARLIER SIR NIELSEN. GERMAN COLLEAGUES YEAH I UNDERSTAND THE INTEREST IN THE BILL I ACTUALLY EXPECTED A LOT MORE INTEREST IN HAS BEEN MANIFESTED HERE TODAY. A GENERAL OBSERVATION AND I WANT TO FOCUS ON A ONE PARTICULAR PROVISION THAT I WILL PROPER AND AMEND THAT RELATED TO FOR DECADES I'VE BEEN HERE THAT THEIR BILL AFTER BILL AFTER BILL PURPORTEDLY TO ENHANCE VOTER PARTICIPATION IN OUR ELECTIONS AND NOBLE GOAL WILL SEEK. OVER THE DECADES HAVE THE OR- VOTING PERCENTAGES CHANGE MUCH HARDLY. THEY HAVE BEEN THEY FLOW BUT ALL WITHIN A PRETTY SIMILAR RANGE ON RARE OCCASIONS BECAUSE CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THERE'LL BE A LOT OF INTEREST. BUT THEN WE GO BACK TO THE MALAISE. AND I JUST WOULD OBSERVE THAT I THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE A MUCH MORE RESOLVED PARK ON OUR FAMILIES. OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS AND JUST SOCIETY. TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO EXERCISE THEIR FRANCHISE TO VOTE. AGAIN THERE ARE TIME AND TIME AGAIN THAT NEW IDEAS. AND NOW HERE IS A YET ANOTHER ONE. WILL IT MAKE A CONCLUSIVE DIFFERENCE I DON'T KNOW. BUT I DO HAVE A GREAT RESERVATIONS ABOUT ALL THE BALLOT FLOATING OUT THERE NOW. TOWARDS THE END IN SECTION TWO YOU WOULD BEGIN ON. LINE NUMBER THIRTY FIVE. IT TALKS JUST TO SUMMARIZE FROM THAT SECTION THREE THOUSAND POINT FIVE EIGHTY HAND NOT WITHSTANDING OF THE LAW. STATE WIDE THE GENERAL THAT WILL BE HELD AT THE MEMBER THIRD. TWENTY TWENTY THE COUNTY ELECTION OFFICIAL SHALL NO LATER THAN TWENTY NINE DAYS BEFORE THE DAY OF THE ELECTION. TO EVERY REGISTERED VOTER. AND THEN I WOULD WANT TO INSERT AFTER EVERY REGISTERED VOTER ONLINE THIRTY FIVE THE WORDS EXCEPT. IN ACTIVE VOTERS IN THE GLOBAL IT WOULD GO ON IN THE COUNTY. AND THEN THE COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICIAL FEEL HAVE FIVE DAYS THE POINT THERE IS. IN ACTIVE VOTERS WE KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM. THE LA COUNTY WAS ORDERED TO I CAN'T THINK FORGET ABOUT ONE POINT. AND A HALF MILLION VOTERS FROM THE ROLLS EVERY YEAR WE HAVE THE PROLIFERATION. AND THE REGISTRARS AND EVEN THE SECRETARY STATE I ALWAYS SAY WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE PEOPLE POWER. THE PERSIAN KEEP THESE VOTING ROLLS UP TO DATE. AND SOME OF THE DECEASED A BEEN ON FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS. THAT WOULD BE IT IS WE TAKE STEPS FORWARD THEN IF YOU CONSIDER THIS FORWARD I DO NOT BUT THAT WE DO I WOULD THEN ASK THEN MANAGEMENT CHAIRMAN IF THAT THE AS A FORMAL. FORMALLY SUBMITTED. AMENDMENT TO BE ADOPTED INTO THE BILL. OF THANK YOU CENTER NIELSEN OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN CARE TO RESPOND SURE IN AT ONE THING THE SENDER- FOR HIS COMMENTS AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT MASK THE ARE GOING ON- IF YOU CAN SEND ME A LINK I WANT ONE MYSELF DONE TO THE CONCERNED ABOUT ADDING THAT ABOUT ADDING SPECIFICALLY STATING IN ACTIVE VOTERS ARE NOT TO AN ACTIVE VOTERS IN THAT SECTION OF THE BILL IS THAT. ADDING THAT LANGUAGE. EVEN IMPLICATION THAT INACTIVE VOTERS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE GETTING BALLOTS. FOR VOTERS CHOICE ACT MAIL BALLOT ELECTIONS. AND MAILED OUT PRECINCTS- NOW. NOBODY HAS EVER INTERPRETED CALIFORNIA LAW TO IMPLY THAT THE THAT THE REGION'S THAT FOLLOW VOTERS CHOICE ACT MAIL BALLOT ELECTIONS IN MAY ABOUT PRECINCTS SHOULD BE SENDING THEM TO AN ACTIVE VOTERS BUT IF WE- SPECIFICALLY STATE THAT THIS PREVENTION AND THEN ONE TO CREATE THE IMPLICATION THAT. INACTIVE VOTERS SHOULD GET BALLOTS IN THOSE OTHER SITUATIONS- AND SO I'M OPEN TO IT TO YOU KNOW US TALKING AND TRYING TO GET A BETTER SENSE AND MAKING SURE THAT- IF THERE'S A WAY TO DO THIS WITH OUT. THEM CREATING AN IMPLICATION WE SHOULD BE SENDING AN ACTIVE VOTERS BALLOTS IN OTHER SITUATIONS BUT NOBODY HAS EVER. THAT IS ACTIVE VOTER TO GET BALLOTS YOU READ. TWENTY TWO TWENTY SIX SECTION A SUBSECTION TWO OF THE ELECTIONS QUOTA CLEARLY SAYS THAT IN ACTIVE VOTER REGISTRATION STATUS MEANS THAT YOU DO NOT RECEIVE ELECTION MATERIAL SO I THINK THIS IS THE ALL IN ALL DUE RESPECT A BIT OF A RED HERRING- I DON'T ACTUALLY THINK THIS IS. AN ISSUE- I DON'T WANT TO CREATE AN ISSUE BY CREATE A BIKE BY CORRECTING A NON ISSUE- BUT I NEED A WILL LOOK INTO THIS FURTHER. TO SEE IF THERE WAYS TO. YEAH FURTHER CLARIFY THE EXISTING LAW THAT IS ALWAYS BEEN INTERPRETED TO READ THAT IN ACTIVE VOTERS DO NOT RECEIVE ELECTION MATERIALS INCLUDING-BALLOTS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN I ASSUME BY YOUR COMMENTS HERE YOU'RE NOT ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENT. CORRECT SENATE HURTS. YOU KNOW I WON- A DOVE TAIL A BIT ON CENTER NIELSEN'S POINT ABOUT HOW THE CHALLENGES OVER MANY YEARS. ON THE BEEN NOTHING LESS AN EXTRAORDINARY AND THAT WE REALLY HAVEN'T SEEN SOME SIGNIFICANT. INCREASE INTERNALIZED THE CITY COUNCIL IN THE ONE OF THE COMMITTEES ARE REPRESENTED IN LOS ANGELES EIGHT POINT 9% CORPORATE LAW REQUIRES A QUORUM BASICALLY OF- ENTITY BEFORE YOU CAN CONDUCT BUSINESS I. DEEPLY CONCERNS ME AND I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS ISSUE. IN MY ENTIRE POLITICAL CAREER IN MANY DIFFERENT CAPACITIES- AND TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING HUMANLY POSSIBLE TO CREATE AN OPEN AND HONEST ELECTION WITH THE MOST NUMBER OF PEOPLE PARTICIPATING SOME COUNTRIES YOU KNOW. MAKE IT ILLEGAL NOT TO VOTE LINCOLN THAT DURING THE CIVIL WAR GAVE EVERYONE OF THE UNION SOLDIERS. OF FREE RAILROAD PASSED IN FIFTEEN DAYS LEAVE TO GO VOTE RIGHT. THERE'S BEEN ALL SORTS OF THINGS A LOT OF COUNTRIES YOU GO HOME TO HOME TOWN WHERE THERE'S REALHOMETOWNS OF PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THE GUYS A BIG PLACE WHERE THEY DO THAT AND GET REALLY HIGH TURNOUT. WHAT DO WE DO. WE HAVE AN APPLE IN THIS- FOR YEARS AGO I. WITH THIRTY DAY REGISTRATION NIGHT IN CAMPAIGNING SO MANY TIMES YOU GO TALK TO PEOPLE. WOULD JUST MOVE THEIR APARTMENT A NO AND THEY DIDN'T BE REGISTERED CHANGE THE REGISTRATION SO WE TRY TO GET SAME DAY REGISTRATION OR GRAY DAVIS WE GOT FIFTEEN DAYS. COULD YOU MOVED UP CHECK DONE. DURING OUR GORE'S ELECTION WE HAD THE HANGING CHADS WE HAD MACHINES THAT HAD REAL PROBLEMS TURNED OUT WE TOOK A LOOK AT CALIFORNIA 53% OF OUR MACHINES WE JUST LIKE FLOORS WITH HANGING CHADS SO. WE ARE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO PUT IT PUT ON THE BALLOT AND BUT INITIATIVE TO TRY TO. DEAL WITH THAT IT DIDN'T GET OUT PERFECTLY BUT KEEP. PUSHING AND PUSHING THE ENVELOPE AND I IN FACT INTRODUCED THIS VERY BILL THAT YOU HAVE HERE TODAY. SIX YEARS AGO WHEN I FIRST CAME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE. IN FOR A SERIES OF REASONS WE CHOSE IN THE SENATE TO MOVE. SENATOR ALLEN AND I WAS THEN CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE. IN PARTNERSHIP THROUGH JOINT AUTHORSHIP OF CENTERS THING THAT IF YOU EXTENDED TIME FOR TEN DAYS TO GIVE PEOPLE OPPORTUNITIES THAT THAT WOULD WORK. SO WHY I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS I WOULD MOVE THE BILL AND ASKED IF I COULD BE JOINED ON IN SOME CAPACITY. IT'S SOME APPROPRIATE TIME AS A- PRINCIPAL CALL OR WHATEVER WHAT MANNER YOU DEEM TO SUPPORT THIS BUT- YOU KNOW I DO THINK THE CHALLENGING AND BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE CAN DO. YOU KNOW WHAT OUR SCHWARZENEGGER BIG RAN FOR GOVERNOR HENCE THE TURNOUT IS A MOVIE STAR. WE'RE NOT MOVIE STAR EPISODE. BUT I JUST THINK THAT A- WOULD TRYING CONTINUE FIX TO MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE PARTICIPATE. IS A GOOD THING AND THAT'S WHY I SUPPORT THIS. AND YOU KNOW THERE WERE ISSUES QUITE FRANKLY WERE THE REGISTRAR'S IN CERTAIN COUNTIES DID WANT TO DO THIS BECAUSE IT WAS TOO EXPENSIVE AND TOO COMPLICATED AND MY ATTITUDE IS. WHAT COULD BE MORE PRECIOUS THAN THE RIGHT TO VOTE SO WITH THAT AGAIN I MOVE THE BILL AND THANK YOU FOR INTRODUCING IT. THANK YOU PLEASE ENTER THANK YOU SO HERTZBERG ANYONE ELSE. YES STERN. JUST A QUICK COMMON APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY- AND THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I'D ALSO LIKE TO BE ADDED ON IT THE APPROPRIATE TIME IF POSSIBLE AND I JUST. I WISH THAT THIS CONVERSATION MORE CURRENT IN STATE LEGISLATURES ACROSS THIS COUNTRY- SO. FEEL SO PRIVILEGED TO BE SITTING IN A POSITION WHERE WE HAVE. SUCH PROACTIVE LEADERSHIP FROM. CHAIRMAN IN BOTH ELECTIONS COMMITTEES IN BOTH HOUSES WAS FROM OUR SECRETARY STATE WHO JUMPED IN. UNHESITATINGLY AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR ON THIS AND- YOU KNOW I DO THINK THERE'S SOME EXISTING LEGAL AUTHORITY TO DO WHAT. SECRETARY'S ALREADY STARTED TO PURSUE BUT- I SEE THIS MEASURE IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF GUARDING AT AFRICAN REPLIED YOU FOR TAKING ITSELF. THANK YOU THE SENATE. IF I. COULD RETURN I'D LIKE TO REQUEST A ROLL CALL VOTE ON IT THOUGH JUST TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE OFFERED THE AMENDMENT. ROLL CALL VOTE ON THE AMENDMENT. ON THE AMENDMENT NOT ON THE BILL BUT ON THE AMENDMENTS AT THIS POINT. ALL RIGHTY- SO WE ARE MOVING THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE NIELSEN ASKING FOR A ROLL CALL VOTE ALL RIGHT. MR I'LL MOVE THE MEMBERS. REGION THAT ALMOST ALL RIGHTS ARE VOTE AGAINST IT BUT ON THE MOVE FOR. ARE ALL RIGHT IN- MISTER SECTORS SUMA TAKES A MAJORITY OF THE COMMITTEE TO GO AHEAD ALL RIGHT. THIS SECTOR CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. TO BE ON SENATOR NIELSEN'S AMENDMENT NUMBER CALL ON BURKE NO NIELSEN.

AND NO WAY TO OWN AND TO ANYONE ON THIS BUT IT'S A TROUBLING THING TO ME OVER SO MANY YEARS AND SO MUCH DIFFICULTY THAT WE'VE HAD ELICITING THE RESPONSE FROM THE CITIZENS TO EXERCISE THE RIGHT TO VOTE. IN A REALLY DISTURBS ME THAT WE TO SO VIGOROUSLY PURSUE. MAIL VOTING. WHAT IS THE BEST DISCIPLINE FOR ACCOUNTABILITY AS TO WHETHER SOMEONE IS REGISTERED TO VOTE A LEGAL CITIZEN TO VOTE. THE LOCAL POLLING PLACE WHO ARE MANNED BY YOUR NEIGHBORS. THAT'S A GREAT DISCIPLINE BUT WE DON'T HAVE MUCH OF THAT ANYMORE IT'S WANING IN FACT MANY ARE SAYING WE SHOULD NOT HAVE THESE LOCAL PLACES% ANYMORE. IT'S A PROBLEM FOR SOCIETY AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT WE SHOULD REALLY PAY ATTENTION TO THAT IN OUR HEARTS AND SOULS EACH OF US INDIVIDUALLY. ABOUT IN THE ENCOMPASSING OTHER PEOPLE TO VOTE. THANK YOU pINDULGENCE THANK YOU- MISTER VICE CHAIR. ALL RIGHT- THANK YOU BEFORE YOU CLOSE JUST JUST COUPLE CONCLUDING COMMENTS I DO FIND IT INTERESTING AND IRONIC THAT THIS IS SOMEHOW BEEN POSTURED AS A PARTISAN ISSUE FROM THE VERY TOP- IT IS EVIDENCED BY THE FOLKS WHO CALLED IN TODAY ON THE PHONE- I JUST JUDGE MY OWN HOME COUNTY THAT THE GROUP THE PROLIFERATION OF. MAIL IN BALLOTS THE BETTER REPUBLICANS DO IT JUST ILLUSTRATE THE LAST TWO ELECTIONS- HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THE BUT FOR THE MAIL IN BALLOTS- ORANGE COUNTY THAT- FIVE OF THE SIX CURRENT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO ARE DEMOCRATS WOULD WOULD NOT OF ONE BECAUSE REPUBLICANS DID SO MUCH BETTER BALLOT BALLOTS. THERE IS NO EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE THAT SUPPORTS. THE PROPOSITION SOMEHOW MARYLAND BALLOTS A BENEFIT ONE PARTY OVER THE OTHER I WOULD ARGUE THAT IN FACT IN IN OUR KELLY THEY WILL BENEFIT REPUBLICANS OVER DEMOCRATS BUT BE THAT AS IT MAY. I ALSO HIM ALWAYS FASCINATED BY VOTING HAVING SPENT TIME IN OTHER COUNTRIES WITNESS FOR EXAMPLE IN AFGHANISTAN PEOPLE WHO LITERALLY GIVE THEIR LIVES TO VOTE WAIT FOR SOMETIMES DAYS. TO BE ABLE TO VOTE AND- AGAIN REST THEIR LIVES AND THEIR FAMILIES LIVES TO DO SO THE THAT WE HAVE SO MANY CHALLENGES HERE IN UNITED STATES MAKING SURE THAT WE- IN FRANCHISE AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. OF HAVING SAID THAT THOUGH THE THIS IS A- MEASURE THAT THE DOES SO PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT. CODE NINETEEN CRISIS FACING CALIFORNIANS SO- I APPLAUD YOUR LEADERSHIP I APPLAUD YOUR EFFORTS AND COURAGE CALIFORNIANS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS. LEGITIMATE PROCESS OF VOTE. BY MAIL- WE'RE GOING TO SEE I THINK OTHER BILLS TO PROVIDE FOR VOTING- IN PERSON VOTING WILL BE AN OPPORTUNITY I BELIEVE FOR EVERY PERSON CALIFORNIA TO VOTE IN PERSON IF THEY SHOULD TEACH SO CHOOSE. BUT I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE ACTUALLY FLATTEN THE CURB BUT IF YOU WANT TO VOTE IN PERSON YOU DO SO PRIOR TO ELECTION DAY. SO HAVING SAID THAT. MR BERMAN OUT OF TURN OVER TO YOU FOR YOUR CLOTHES THANK YOU- CHARMER AGAIN- THE- AGREE WITH A LOT OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE TODAY AND THEN THINK THAT IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE FIND OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE- THE OPPORTUNITY FOR. CALIFORNIANS TO VOTE IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT MORE PEOPLE DON'T VOTE. THIS BILL IS REALLY ALL ABOUT. MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN VOTE SAFELY- ANYWAY I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT THAT SO MANY PEOPLE. HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CALL IN- TO THE HEARING TODAY FROM THE SAFETY OF THEIR OWN HOME- THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO COME. TO SACRAMENTO THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO STAND NEAR EACH OTHER THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO RISK THEIR HEALTH. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. TO MAKE THAT OPPORTUNITY PROVIDE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO EVERY CALIFORNIA THAT FOR THE NOVEMBER GENERAL ELECTION. AND MAKE IT EASY AS POSSIBLE FOR THEM. TO VOTE FROM HOME I DO WANT TO SAY THERE WERE. SOME ACCUSATIONS THROWN AROUND AROUND VOTER FRAUD- AND AS WE ALL KNOW THERE'S BEEN NO- ALL THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THERE'S BEEN NO. SYSTEMIC VOTER FRAUD. IN CALIFORNIA OR IN AMERICA THIS PRESIDENT ACTUALLY SET UP. AND BROUGHT THE FULL FORCE AND WEIGHT. OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BEHIND A VOTER FRAUD COMMISSION. THAT DISSOLVE THE BEFORE THEY FOUND ANY VOTER FRAUD AND DON'T YOU THINK THAT IF THEY HAD FOUND VOTER FRAUD IN CALIFORNIA. VOTER FRAUD EXISTED IN CALIFORNIA THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND IT. AND THEY WERE BROADCASTED FROM VERY RADIO STATION OR TWITTER PROFILE THEY COULD POSSIBLY DO IT FROM- SO I REALLY. I THINK IT'S SAD. THAT INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS. TRY TO DELEGITIMIZE ARE% ALLEGE THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA BY CONSTANTLY THROWING AROUND ACCUSATIONS OF VOTER FRAUD- AND WOULD DISCOURAGE THEM FROM DOING SO WITHOUT ANY. FACTS BUT APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE TODAY AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NOT. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT IS THERE MOTION THAT'S RIGHT CENTERS FOR GOOD MOVE IT UP THE SECTOR TO CALL THE ROLL.
