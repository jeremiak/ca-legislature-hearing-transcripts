THIS BILL EXTENDS THE CURRENT EVICTION MORATORIUM WHICH WAS DUE TO EXPIRE ON SUNDAY. JANUARY THIRTY FIRST IT'LL BE EXTENDED NOW UNTIL JUNE THIRTIETH. TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IT ALSO APPROPRIATE AND ALLOCATES ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF FEDERAL FUNDS. IT SETS REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS FOR RENTAL RELIEF. IT EXTENDS THE VARIOUS PROTECTIONS TO TENANTS RELATING TO UNPAID RENT DURING THE CALL WITH NINETEEN PANDEMIC IT CREATES A PROCESS TO USE A CONTRACTOR ADMINISTRATOR FOR THE NEW RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. AND IT REQUIRES REPORTING ON PROGRAM PERFORMANCE AND EXPENDITURES. MEMBERS I REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MS REYES MISTER DAVID CHIU YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS BUDGET TRAILER BILL. AS YOU ALL KNOW IN FOUR DAYS THE CURRENT BECOME MORE TOURING THAT WE PUT IN PLACE AT THE END OF LAST SESSION. EXPIRES AND BASED ON RECENT CENSUS SURVEYS POSTED TWO MILLION CALIFORNIANS HAVE STATED THAT THEY HAVE LITTLE OR NO CONFIDENCE. OF PAYING NEXT MONTH'S RENT. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S AT STAKE. IN OTHER STATES WHERE VICTOR MORE TORRANCE OF EXPIRED. UCLA STUDY DOCUMENTED OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE THOUSAND ADDITIONAL COVERED CASES CLOSE TO ELEVEN THOUSAND DEATHS. AT THIS DEADLIEST OF MOMENTS IN THE PANDEMIC WE CAN'T HAVE TENANTS PUSHED OUT ON THE STREETS OR INTO OVERCROWDED SETTINGS. I WANNA TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK LEADERSHIP STARTING WITH OUR SPEAKER MAJORITY LEADER SPEAKER STAFF. ARE HOUSING COMMITTEE STAFF THE SENATE PRESIDENT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND ADVOCATES FOR ALL SIDES. LIKE ALL CHALLENGING COMPROMISES THIS IS NOT A PERFECT DEAL BUT IT IS NECESSARY TO AVOID A DEPICTION CLIFF. AND TO GET DESPERATELY NEEDED MONEY BOTH THE STRUGGLING TENANTS AND LANDLORDS QUICKLY. I WANNA TAKE A MOMENT O THANK THE STATEWIDE COALITION OF HUNDREDS OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR TENANTS WHO SUPPORTED AB FIFTEEN. BECAUSE OF YOU. NOT ONLY ARE CURRENT EVICTION PROTECTIONS EXTENDED THROUGH JUNE. BUT LATE FEES ARE PROHIBITED. RENTAL THAT CAN'T BE SOLD THE PREDATORY LENDING COMPANIES AND OTHER LOOPHOLES IN EXISTING LAW ARE BEING CLOSED. WELL SORT OF STATE THE WITH THIS BILL THE DISCUSSION IS NOT OVER. WE'RE STILL GOING TO NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ASSISTTENANTS WHO WILL STILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT DEBT AFTER THIS BILL. AND I SHARE THE CONCERNS OF TENANTS ABOUT THE FACT. THAT THE DEBT RELIEF ATTENDED CATS IS DEPENDENT ON A LANDLORDS COOPERATION. WHICH IS A TROUBLING POWER IMBALANCE. WE NEED TO AGGRESSIVELY MONITOR THIS PROGRAM. TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL TEND TO BE REALLY FOR RECEIVING IT. AND I EXPECT THAT OUR LEGISLATURE WILL LIKELY NEED TO CONSIDER FOLLOW UP LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS GAPS IN THIS BILL AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DEBT RELIEF FOR LOW INCOME TENANTS. I APPRECIATE LEADERSHIP'S COMMITMENT BOTH TO AGGRESSIVE MONITORING AND TO WORKING TOGETHER TO ADDRESS FUTURE ISSUES BEFORE THIS EXTENSION EXPIRES AT THE END OF JUNE. IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION TO ASSISTING STRUGGLING LANDLORDS. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT NO CALIFORNIA TENANTS IS AFFECTED. OR SADDLED WITH LONG TERM DEBT. DUE TO A PANDEMIC THAT THEY HAD NO CONTROL OVER. AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU MR TO MR BLOOM. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED MISTER BLOOM I'M GOING TO ASK THAT YOU RETIRED TO THE REAR OF THE CHAMBER AND WHILE YOU ARE DOING THAT LET ME CALL ON MISTER LEE. AND THEN FOLLOWED BY MR BLOOM IN THE REAR CHAMBER MISTER LEE. I RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU. MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB NINETY ONE THOUGH I DO HAVE MY CONCERNS FIRST I WANT TO COMMEND THE LEADERSHIP OF OUR HOUSE AS WELL AS THAT OF THE SENATE TO PRIORITIZE KEEPING CALIFORNIANS HOUSE DURING THIS PANDEMIC IT SHOWS OUR COMMITMENT TO WORKING FAMILIES SINCE THIS IS THE FIRST EARLY BUDGET ITEM WE TAKE UP. NO ONE SHOULD LOSE. OKAY NO ONE SHOULD LOSE THEIR HOME DURING THE PANDEMIC. AS WE CONTINUE THIS BATTLE DEFEATING THE VIRUS IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE ADOPT PROTECTIONS FOR TENANTS SO THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO REMAIN IN THEIR HOMES AS WELL AS PROVIDE RELIEF FOR SMALL LANDLORDS. THAT MAY HAVE SUFFERED INCOME LOSS FOR NEARLY A YEAR NOW. WELL TO START A SESSION WAS DELAYED THIS YEAR FOR US WE'RE NOW FINALIZING THIS BILL FOUR DAYS. FOUR DAYS BEFORE THE EVICTION MORATORIUM IS SET TO EXPIRE THAT'S FOUR DAYS WERE SOME TENANTS AND LANDLORDS MAY STILL BELIEVE THE MORATORIUM EXPIRES ON MONDAY. TENANTS CONTINUE TO LIVE WITH ANXIETY UNCERTAINTY UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHETHER. OR NOT THEY'LL BE ABLE TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE OR KEEP A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD THIS WINTER. AS ONE OF THE FEW MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE TO BE A RENTER. AND TO NOT OWN ANY PROPERTY OF MY OWN I UNDERSTAND THIS ANXIETY. ACCORDING TO A RECENT REPORT MORE THAN A MILLION CALIFORNIANS ARE BEHIND ON RENT THAT'S NEARLY ONE IN FIVE RENTERS IN THE FIFTH. WEALTHIEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD ONE IN FIVE. IN MY HOME COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY THAT TRANSLATES OVER THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS THAT'S THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS LIVING WITH ANXIETY OF HOUSING AND SECURITY. ALTHOUGH HOUSINGINSECURITY AS AFFECTED COMMUNITIESOF COLOR LONG BEFORE COVER NINETEEN APPEARED THIS CURRENT PANDEMIC AND SUBSEQUENT ECONOMIC COVER IS DEEPENING THESE INEQUALITIES. THERE IS SOME LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL NOW WITH THE FUNDING PROVIDED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND ITS PROGRAMMATIC APPROACH WE CAN WE CAN ACHIEVE A DEGREE OF STABILITY FOR FEW MONTHS BOTH RENTERS AND LANDLORDS. THIS IS A CRUCIAL URGENCIA FORD BUT OUR WORK IS FAR FROM OVER. I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT THIS PLAN GIVES LANDLORDS TOO MUCH POWER IN ALREADY IN BALLOTS RELATIONSHIP. AND ULTIMATELY LEAVES THE FATE OF LOW INCOME TENANTS IN THE HANDS OF THE LANDLORD. IN THIS PROPOSAL I WANT TO POINT OUT TO MY COLLEAGUES IN THIS PROPOSAL IF A LANDLORD POPS IN OPS INVOLUNTARILY. THE RECEIPT PERCENT OF RENT THAT FROM THIS FUNDING. WHILE THE FOR GO TO REMAIN 20% IF THE LAND OPS I. IN A TENT UP. THEN THE RISK ONE FIVE OR OF RENT TO FOR RENT THAT FROM THIS. EVEN THOUGH. IN BOTH CASE ALL MONEY GOES TO THE LAW. THIS MEANS A OUR LAND TO SO NOT. TO VOLUNTEER ACCEPT THE FUNDING THAT IS OFFERED TO THEM. LOW INCOME TENER RECEIVE 75% SUPPORT 75% LESS SUPPORT. NOW I UNDERSTAND THE MOTIVATION IS TO INCENTIVIZELANDLORDS TO OPT INTO THE REALLY FUNDS BUT IS INCUMBENT ON US TO DO MORE TO PROTECT TAX. FOR STARTERS WE NEED TO BE ACTIVELY INVOLVING TENANT GROUPS AND ADVOCATES IN THE PROCESS AND BRING THEM TO NEGOTIATION TABLE. TENNIS GROUPS ARE FRUSTRATED RIGHTFULLY SO. THEY DO NOT HAVE AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE THEIR INPUTS. TENANTS WHO WE ARE ADVOCATING ON BEHALF OF SHOULD HAVE THEIR VOICE THE TABLE THEIR VOICES SHOULD BE HEARD AND THEIR VOICES DESERVE TO BE HEARD. ONE WAY OR ANOTHER WE WILL HAVE TO REVISIT THIS ISSUE BEFORE JUNE THIRTIETH. THE LOOMING EVICTION CLIFF THE MOUNTING DEBT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROGRAM WILL NOT MAGICALLY RESOLVED TODAY. AND I FOR ONE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO ENGAGE ON THIS ISSUE WITH THE INCREDIBLE LEADERS ARE ASSEMBLY LEADERSHIP. AND COMMIT TO MAKING SURE NO ONE LOSES THEIR HOME DURING THE PANDEMIC. WELL THIS BILL FAR FROM PERFECT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP TO ADDRESSING THIS EVICTION CRISIS FROM WORSENING OUR HOUSING CRISIS. I STILL URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE THANK. THANK YOU MR LEE AND MR BLOOM YOU ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR CHAMBER. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES I RISE TODAY TO JOIN. IN ASKING YOU TO SUPPORT SB NINETY ONE AND I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY. RECOGNIZING THE MEMBERS LEADERSHIP. AND STAFF BUT ESPECIALLY OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO. WHO REALLY GAVE. NEW MEANING TO THE- OVER USED TERM WORKING TIRELESSLY- HE'S PUT IN SO MUCH EFFORT ON THIS BILL AND THE- OF WEEKS AND MONTHS PRECEDING THIS DATE- AND THEY REALLY DESERVES OUR GRATITUDE. WITH OVER THREE NINE COVERT CASES AND CAL LAW AND ALL ROAD TO. ALL CAL. IT GOES SAYING THAT URGENT OF GETTING THESE BILLS ON HELP. ON TO ON TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK- IS HERE AND PRESENT. IN AUGUST OF TWENTY TWO WE PASSED AB OH EIGHT EIGHT TO PUT KINDA. WHO ARE FACING RECORD ON AND FINANCIAL. VETERANS BY OUR PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. NOW FIVE LATER. LATER THE PRETTY WILL ON TO THIRTY FIRST AND WE'RE LESS. WITH A DIFFERENT QUESTION AND EVEN MORE DIFFICULT DECISIONS. HOW DO WE CONTINUE TO THOUSANDS TENANTS. ON CUSP OF ALMOST. AND HOW DO WE SUPPORT SMALLER ARE THE CUSP OF FIVE ROOM. JUST A DAYS AGO DID YOU JUST- CAL PROJECT. THAT WE WILL WITNESS. TO HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND NEW INFECTIONS. DOUBLE THE NORMAL NUMBER OF CASES IF WE DO NOT. EXTEND THE MORATORIUM. EDITOR'S BEEN. THAT THE HAS THIS FOR IMPACTED LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND RENTERS. WE ARE FACING AN UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGE AND THE BILLS THAT WE PASSED TODAY WILL PROVIDE REALISTIC AND CREATIVE SOLUTIONS BY PRIORITIZING MARC. HARDEST HIT COMMUNITIES AND OFFERING SUPPORT TO LANDLORDS. THE MAN EXTEND THE NATION STRONG TENANT PROTECTION AND THE TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDS PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED RELIEF. VOTING ON THESE TWO BILLS TODAY DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE BILLS ARE PERFECT FOR THAT THE PROBLEM IS SOLVED INSTEAD. IT ALLOWS US TO CONTINUE ADDRESSING OUTSTANDING CONCERNS AND TACKLE AND ALLOWS US MORE TIME TO TACKLE THIS PRESSING ISSUE WITHOUT FACING AN ADDITIONAL AVALANCHE OF ISSUES. I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING COMMITTEE LEADERSHIP ON THESE EFFORTS SO THAT COME JUNE THIRTIETH. WE WILL BE READY TO FURTHER PROTECT TENANTS AND SUPPORT CALIFORNIANS DURING THIS DIFFICULT TIME I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MITCHELL THIS RIVAS. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED AT YOUR DESK.

THEY ARE CAUGHT BETWEEN TWO REALITIES THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO KEEP THEIR JOBS MUST CONTINUE WORKING. OFTEN EXPOSING THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES TO THE VIRUS JUST TO CONTINUE TO MAKE ENDS MEET. OTHERWISE IF THEY LOSE THEIR JOB OR BECOME SICK DUE TO COVERED THEY HAVE NO ABILITY TO PAY THE RENT. THE BILL IS MORE THAN JUST VOTE FOR ME THE ACTION WE ARE TAKING TODAY IS A HUMANITARIAN OBLIGATION WE HAVE AS ELECTED OFFICIALS. TO MITIGATE IMPACTS ON THOSE WHO ARE BEING DEVASTATED ECONOMICALLY BY THIS PANDEMIC.

UTILITIES ARE DOWN THE FOOD CHAIN HERE NOW WITH UTILITIES WE ALL THINK ELECTRIC AND GAS COMPANIES IN THE BIG THE BIG GUYS. I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND MY COLLEAGUES THAT THERE ARE WATER DISTRICTS AND WATER AUTHORITIES IN ALL OF OUR- ASSEMBLY DISTRICTS AND IN AND ALSO OTHER RURAL. DISTRICTS MANY OF OUR WATER DISTRICTS THAT SERVE POORER PEOPLE. ARE UP 230% IN ARREARS FURTHER WATER BILLS SO THE WATER DISTRICTS STILL HAVE THE OVERHEAD BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE INCOME SO IN THE FUTURE WITH THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION RE DOING STIMULUS PLANS I WOULD LIKE. MY COLLEAGUES TO THANK OF WATER DISTRICTS AND MAYBE PUT THEM A LITTLE BIT FURTHER UP ON THE FOOD CHAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MR VOEPEL MR MATHIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. RISES SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN BOTH A LANDLORD. AN ATTENDANT. THE SOMEBODY THAT GREW UP POOR. WHO'S BEEN ON FOOD STAMPS. WATER STANDS WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE AN EBT CARD. I REPRESENT A DISTRICT THAT IS. OVER 60% FAMILIES WHO ARE ON ASSISTANCE. I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES BEFORE ME THAT THIS ISN'T PERFECT. HELL MOST THE LEGISLATION WE PASS ISN'T. BUT WE ARE IN A DESPERATE TIME RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE FAMILIES STRUGGLING TO PUT FOOD ON THEIR TABLES. WE HAVE FAMILIES STRUGGLING TO GET THEIR EDT CHECKS. THIS PROGRAM OFFERS AN OPTION. IN TIMES OF DARKNESS. AN OPTION THAT LANDLORDS CAN CHOOSE IF THEY WOULD LIKE. AN OPTION FOR TENANTS. IT'S AN OPTION TO GET RELIEF. NOW I LIKE MANY HAVE GREAT CONCERNS. AS WE ASK GOVERNOR NEWSOM TO PLEASE NOT SCREW THIS ONE UP TO. AND I KNOW WE WILL ALL BE WATCHING. AS WE DISCUSSED IN BUDGET COMMITTEE YESTERDAY. WE ASKED FOR A METRICS ON HOW THIS PROGRAM IS GOING TO BE MEASURED. WHAT ARE THOSE MEASUREMENTS OF SUCCESS GOING TO BE. WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO LOOK LIKE. ARE WE GOING TO MAKE SURE. THE WEBSITE FOR THIS PROGRAM DOESN'T CRASH LIKE THE OTHERS HAVE. ARE WE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CALL CENTERS. ACTUALLY WORK. FOR OUR ELDERLY AND OTHERS. WHEN ROLE DISTRICTS LIKE MINE AND SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY OF EVEN HAVING INTERNET SERVICE. WE'RE GOING TO ENSURE THAT THIS PROGRAM IS ACTUALLY EQUITABLE FOR EVERYONE. AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS I ENCOURAGE ALL OF YOU. TO HELP ME. ENSURE THAT THIS PROGRAM GETS DONE CORRECTLY. THAT ARE ADMINISTRATORS. OVER THIS PROGRAM ARE DOING THEIR JOBS. IN THAT WE DON'T HAVE YET ANOTHER GOVERNMENT PROGRAM THAT FILLS THE PEOPLE THAT IT'S DESIGNED TO SERVE. I KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT. BUT OUR PEOPLE NEED THIS. I PRAY TO GOD THE ADMINISTRATION GETS IT RIGHT ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER MATHIS THIS KAMLAGER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I TO RISE IN ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT WITH AN AYE VOTE FOR SB NINETY ONE. YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN HERE FOR SOME TIME AND I'M- STILL LOOKING FOR THE PERFECT BILL THIS IS NOT THAT BILL. BUT THE PERFECT CAN NEVER BE THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD. I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU MISTER SPEAKER A COUPLE OF REASONS WHY I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL. BECAUSE OF STORIES COMING OUT OF MY DISTRICT. BECAUSE OF THE STORY OF KELLY. KELLY IS A RENTER KELLY THE TENANTS IN THE FIFTY FOURTH. AND SHE RENTS FROM VERY SMALL MOM AND POP LANDLORDS. THIS WOMAN OWNS A SIX UNIT BUILDING. TWO OF THOSE UNITS ARE VACANT BECAUSE OF COVERT. AND SHE HAS CANCER THAT SHE STRUGGLING TO MANAGE. AND KELLY IS AFRAID. THAT IF WE DON'T PASS THIS BILL. THERE WILL BE NO PROTECTIONS FOR HER LANDLORD WHO SHE LIKES. WHO KEEPS THE RENTS LOW WHO KNOWS THE COMMUNITY. AND THAT LANDLORDS WILL BE FORCED. TO SELL HER UNIT OR IT WILL BE LOST. AND GOBBLED UP BY A CORPORATE ENTITY. THAT OWNS ALMOST 70% OF THE UNITS. AND ISN'T OF THE COMMUNITY. I'M GOING TO BE VOTING FOR THIS BILL BECAUSE OF JANICE. WHOSE FAMILY WAS A VERY SAID IN DECEMBER. RIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T PAY THE RENT. WELL THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED. AND IF WE PASS THIS BILL THE MAYBE STORIES LIKE THAT. WON'T HAPPEN. I'M LOOKING AT TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AS A YEAR OF RECOVERY AND WE SHOULD BE MARSHALLING IN. THE RESOURCES OF THE STATE. TO HELP CALIFORNIANS RECOVER.AND RENT LIKE CHILD CARE IS A BASIC NEED FOR WORKING FAMILIES. WE CAN PASS THE SPELL WE SHOULD PASS THIS BILL. WE BETTER PASSED THIS BILL. BUT AFTER THAT LET'S TALK ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION IN MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE GETTING INFORMATION OUT TO OUR CONSTITUENTS AND MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE GETTING OUT THE RELIEF THAT THEY DESERVE. SO ON BEHALF OF JANICE AND KELLY. AND THE THOUSANDS OF OTHER FOLKS THAT LIVE IN RENTS IN THE FIFTY FOUR. AND I TO A RENTAL. I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE ON SB NINETY ONE. THANK YOU MISS KAMLAGER. MISSION. ONE MISTER WHEN ON. HERBIE FROM THE REAR OF THE CHAMBER MISSION WHEN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER FOR ALLOW ME TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS I BELIEVE TODAY'S BILL HAS STRUCK SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD. EFFORT TO HELP NOT ONLY THE TENNIS. BUT ALSO THOSE SMALL MOM AND POP LANDLORDS WHO OWNS ONE RENTAL OR TO. LOTS OF THESE LANDLORDS ARE NOT A BIG CORPORATION LANDLORDS THAT OWNS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF UNITS THESE ARE LANDLORDS. WHO BOUGHTA RENTAL TO HELP SUPPLEMENT A RETIREMENT INCOME OR SUPPLEMENT THE PART TIME JOB. SO PLEASE DO UNDERSTAND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT LANDLORDS IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE BIG CORPORATE LANDLORDS. THESE ARE THE MOM AND POP LANDLORDS JUST LIKE THE MOM AND POP. BUSINESSES THEY TO HAVE SUFFER. THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE THEY HAVE GONE OUT A YEAR NOW WITHOUT ANY INCOME. THEY ARE ALSO TRYING TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE FOR THEIR FAMILIES AS WELL. AND MAKING SURE THAT THEIR CHILDREN ARE TAKEN CARE OF OR THEIR GRANDCHILDREN OR TAKING CARE OF. AND IF THEY'RE HELPING THE CHILDREN IS BECAUSE THE CHILDREN WHO ARE POLY ADULT. WHO LOST THEIR JOB. SO THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE BIG CORPORATION THAT YOU'RE ALWAYS THINKING UP TOP A LANDLORDS. AS WE MOVE FORWARD. I ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING AS THE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS. ONE THERE'S NO TIME FRAME AS FAST AS THEY NEED TO GET THE RENTAL SYSTEM MONEY. IS IT GONNA BE WEEKS. ONCE WE KNOW EDT SYSTEM OF THE GOVERNOR OF OUR STATE GOVERNMENT IS NOT WORKING WELL. I HOPE IT'S NOT TO BE THE SAME SYSTEM OR SIMILAR LEE RUN. THERE'S ALSO NO LANGUAGE FOR THE FOR THE LANDLORDS ARE REQUIRED TO SEND TO THE TENANTS. REGARDING THE RENTAL SYSTEM PROGRAMS. ARE THERE ANY SPECIFIC. THAT WOULD BE COMING OUT TO SYSTEM LANDLORDS OR THEY SUPPOSED TO HIRE AN ATTORNEY TO DRAFT SOMETHING UP. AS MENTIONED IS A SMALL MOM AND POPS LANDLORDS. THAT'S VERY BURDENSOME BECAUSE HIRING AN ATTORNEY TO DRAFT. A CONTRACT OR NOTICE. GIVE ME A THOUSAND DOLLARS. EASILY THEY TOO DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF MONEY WE NEED TO HELP THEM AND HAVE A UNIFORM. DOCUMENT FOR THEM TO USE. WHAT IF WHAT IF THE TENANT REFUSES TO APPLY FOR THE SYSTEM. IS THE LANDLORD ON THE HOOK. AND THEN WILL BE ABLE TO RECEIVE THE RENTAL RELIEF. I KNOW THE BILL IT DOES ADDRESS THAT A LITTLE BIT BUT I THINK IT CAN GO A LITTLE FURTHER. TO MAKING SURE THAT IT'S CLEAR FOR THE TENANT AND LANDLORD AND THEY KNOW WHAT THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES ARE. TO RECEIVE THE FUNDS FOR THE LANDLORDS MUST SHOW GOOD FAITH. THAT THEY HAVE TRIED EVERY OTHER RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS TO HELP THE TENNIS. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WHAT DOES GOOD FAITH MEAN. I THINK THAT DEFINITION. MIGHT BE DIFFERENT IN MY UNDERSTANDING VERSUS YOURS FOR AN ATTORNEY. OR SOMEBODY ELSE SO I BELIEVE THAT IF WE HAVE SOME KIND OF LANGUAGE SO WE CAN ALL UNDERSTAND WHAT GOOD FAITH MEAN I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL NOT ONLY FOR THE TENANT BUT ALSO FOR THE LANDLORD AS WELL. LAST I KNOW THAT THERE'S THREE DISTRIBUTION BROWN'S. IS THE RENTAL ASSISTANCE MONEY DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF NEED. IF SO. HOW LONG DOES EACH ROUND TAKE. WILL BE DAYS WEEKS MONTHS BECAUSE THIS GOES TO ONLY SIX MONTHS. WE DON'T HAVE TIME WE NEED TO MOVE FAST THEY NEED THE ASSISTANT NOW AND SO I ASK THAT ASWE MOVE FORWARD IN LOOKING AT THE BILL AND HOW TO IMPLEMENT IT THANK YOU PLEASE LOOK AT THESE AND CONSIDER AND BE REMINDED. THAT WE NEED TO HELP ALL CALIFORNIANS. AND NOT JUST ONE OVER ANOTHER BECAUSE THEY ALL NEED HELP. WE NEED TO GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER. ASK ALL CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR WHEN MR KILEY. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. CALIFORNIANS ARE NOT ASKING FOR A PERPETUAL ADDICTION MOTOR MORATORIUM ON TOP OF THE FEDERAL MORATORIUM THAT ALREADY EXISTS CALIFORNIANS ARE ASKING FOR THE RIGHTS TO GET BACK TO WORK SHORT OF THAT THERE AT LEAST ASKING TO GET THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT CHECK RATHER THAN HAVING TO WATCH IT LAND IN A STATE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY. WE'VE HAD ABOUT THE NATION'S WORST UNEMPLOYMENT AND ITS MOST DYSFUNCTIONAL. UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE THROUGHOUT THE LAST YEAR. AND THIS MEASURE IS AN EXCUSE FOR NEGLECTING THOSE STAGGERING PROBLEMS. I AM NOT GOING TO. ENABLE THAT BLACKED BY VOTING FOR IT. INSTEAD I'M GOING TO AGAIN IN FOR THIS LEGISLATURE TO ASSERT ITSELF AS A CO EQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. ON MATTERS OF CENTRAL IMPORTANCE TO THE LIVES AND LIVELIHOODS OF THE PEOPLE WE REPRESENT. DR WHAT. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MEMBERS AND I JUST WANT TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL- I RISING HOPE. I RISE WITH THE LITTLE CONCERN. AND A HEALTHY DOSE OF SKEPTICISM AND- I DON'T SAY THAT LIGHTLY- THERE ARE A- THIRTY COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE A POPULATION OF LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND. I REPRESENT FOUR OF THEM. ALL THOSE COUNTIES ARE GOING TO BE TREATED A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY. BIGGER COUNTY'S AGAIN GET DIRECT ALLOCATIONS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THERE'S OTHER A MECHANISM SUPPORT MY SMALLER COUNTIES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO JUMP THROUGH EXTRA HOOPS. NOW YESTERDAY WE HEARD THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A SPECIAL SET ASIDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THERE WHICH PRESUMABLY WILL MAKE EVERYTHING EQUAL. AND MY SO MY SKEPTICISM COMES FROM WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE CURES ACT NGUYEN SMALLER COUNTIES SIMPLY WEREN'T TREATED EQUALLY. RESOURCES WENT TO LARGER COUNTIES A LOT MORE RESOURCES WENT TO LARGER COUNTIES ON A BET THAT SOME OF THOSE COUNTIES WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE MORE OUTBREAKS OF CORONAVIRUS THAN THEY DID WHILE SOME OF THE SMALLER COUNTIES LIKE. OF MY FRIEND FROM THE DESERT DOWN THERE HAD THE HIGHEST RATES IN THE STATE. SO MY SKEPTICISM IS. AND I'M NOT GOING TO APOLOGIZE. FOR ADVOCATING FOR MY CONSTITUENTS. IN RURAL COMMUNITIES WE OFTEN GET SHORT SHRIFT. BUT THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT RURAL COMMUNITIES THE PEOPLE WHO ARE INVOLVED WHO HAVE THE BIGGEST RISK OF EVICTION LIVE IN OUR LARGE URBAN AREAS AS WELL. NOW MY SKEPTICISM COMES IN PART. WE HEARD ABOUT A NEW WEBSITES CAN BE ROLLED OUT IN MOBILE APPLICATIONS AND ALLOW PEOPLE TO DO TO ACCESS THIS. WELL IF YOU WANT TO DRIVE IN MY DISTRICT. ABOUT HALF THE DISTANCE FROM NORTH TO SOUTH ABOUT A SEVEN HOUR DRIVE IN HALF THAT DISTANCE YOU DON'T HAVE. OU DON'T HAVE SO ACCESS. WE FOUND OUT NINETEEN CORONAVIRUS TIMES HERE. THAT KIDS CAN'T GET ACCESS TO INTERNET OUT INTO THE INTERNET IT JUST DOESN'T EXIST. SO HOW DO WE REACH THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE THE HIGHEST RISK FOR ADDICTION HOW DO WE GET THEM THAT INFORMATION. THESE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO JUMP THROUGH AN EXTRA HOOP TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. SO I'M GONNA WATCH THIS WITH. CONCERN AND I HOPE THOSE METRICS PROVE ME WRONG- BUT THIS THIS VIRUS HAS SHOWN THAT WE'VE WE'VE GOT SOME SYSTEMIC CHALLENGES HERE IN IN OUR SYSTEMS AND WE NEED TO OVERCOME THEM AND I HOPE THAT EACH CD. HAS THE BAND WITH TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE THIS. PEOPLE WHO ARE FACING EVICTION ARE PROBABLY NOT. HAVING A ROBUST BROADBAND IN THEIR HOMES THEY MAYBE HAVE A FLIP PHONE TO COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE MAYBE THEY DON'T I DON'T KNOW. FORTUNATELY I'M NOT IN THAT SITUATION. BUT RIGHT NOW THOSE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT NEED TO ACCESS A SYSTEM LIKE THIS WHO MAY NOT HAVE THE INTERNET THEY CAN'T EVEN GO TO A PUBLIC LIBRARY BECAUSE THOSE ARE CLOSED. AND THERE'S AND THERE'S INTERNET ACCESS THERE AS WELL. SO MY CONCERN IS LET'S I HOPE THAT I'M WRONG I HOPE WE CAN GET THE ROBUST OUT REACH THAT THE COMMUNICATIONS HAPPEN THE PEOPLE THAT NEED THIS RESISTANCE CAN GET TO IT THAT LANDLORDS. IN THESE AREAS AS WELL WHO ALSO LIVE IN REMOTE AEAS GET ACCESS TO THIS I HOPE IT WORKS I REALLY DO. I VOTE FOR THIS TODAY IN THE HOPE FOR THAT BUT WE WILL BE WATCHING AND WE HOPE THAT OUR SMALLER COMMUNITIES GET JUST AS MUCH ACCESS TO THESE RESOURCES AS LARGER AREAS THAT WILL GET THE MONEY DIRECTLY. THANK YOU. MISS WALDRON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS SB NINETY ONE IS NOT THE PERFECT SOLUTION BUT IT IS A SOLUTION TO A DIRE PROBLEM RENTERS ACROSS OUR STATE HAVE BEEN OUT OF WORK THE NIGHT ASSISTANCE FROM CALIFORNIA'S EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT AND THEN NOW IT RISK ONCE AGAIN OF LOSING THEIR HOUSING. SIMILARLY LANDLORDS HAVE BEEN LEFT HOLDING THE BAG FOR NEARLY A YEAR. NOW THE STATE WILL ASK THEM TO ACCEPT JUST 80% OF WHAT THEY ARE OWED. IN MY DISTRICT WHICH IS VERY RURAL AND LACKS INTERNET SERVICES WELL AND MUCH OF THE AREA. IT INCLUDES SOME OF THE LOWEST INCOME CENSUS TRACTS IN THE NATION. RENTERS AND LANDLORDS ARE DEMANDING SOLUTIONS WE MUST SUPPORT OUR PEOPLE THE RESIDENTS OF OUR STATE WHO ARE STRUGGLING IN THESE TIMES. IN MOST OF MY DISTRICT ALMOST 60% OF SINGLE FAMILY HOMES ARE RENTALS. I'VE HEARD OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN FROM PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT WHO ARE SUFFERING AND THEY NEED HELP WHEN WE CANNOT LEAVE THEM WITHOUT HELP. WHILE I WILL BE SUPPORTING SB NINETY ONE TODAY- WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAM WILL ACTUALLY WORK A SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE MENTIONED. AND THAT IT IS ACCESSIBLE TO ALL AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ALL AROUND THE STATE. CALIFORNIA NEEDS REAL SOLUTIONS AND WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT. WHEN IT COMES TO THE HOUSING CRISIS. THAT PLAGUED OUR STATE LONG BEFORE COVE IT ARRIVED. THIS MEASURE WILL PROVIDE SOME SHORT TERM RELIEF BUT WILL NOT ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING PROBLEMS THAT HAVE MADE CALIFORNIA'S COST OF LIVING THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION. I URGE URGE AND I BOTH. THANK YOU MISS WALDRON MISTER GIBSON. IN THE REAR OF THE CHAMBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT. OF S. B. NINETY ONE. MEMBERS I REPRESENT THE SIX POOREST DISTRICT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE SECOND WORST IN TERMS OF UNEMPLOYMENT. THIS BILL IS ESSENTIAL TO PROTECT THE TENANTS OF ALL. INDIVIDUALS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ARE SUFFERING FROM THIS EFFECT FROM THIS PANDEMIC. MEMBERS UNDERSTAND THIS. IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT. IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT. IT EXTENDS EVICTION PROTECTION UNTIL JUNE AND CREATIVE FUN. TO HELP KEEP FAMILIES IN THEIR HOMES. IN THEIR HOMES IT PROHIBITS LATE FEES OR RENTAL DEBT FROM CODE NINETEEN AND HELP MAKES LANDLORDS HOLE. I WANT TO SAY THIS IS NOT THE END OF THIS ISSUE. WE KNOW MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THIS SPACE MEMBERS OUR WORK IS ONLY JUST GETTING STARTED. MEMBERS ALLOW ME TO SHARE. OUR BRIEF REAL STORY WITH YOU. FROM SOMEONE IN MY DISTRICT. SIMILAR TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUES WHO REPRESENT THE FIFTY FOURTH DISTRICT TALKED ABOUT TALKED ABOUT JANICE AND KELLY WELL I HAVE THE PERMISSION TO USE THE PERSON'S NAME SOME IS GOING TO SAY JAMES MISS JANE DOE. MS JANE DOES A SINGLE MOTHER. OF THREE KIDS AND SHE'S BEEN OUT OF WORK FOR EIGHT MONTHS. DO YOU RECALL THAT NINETEEN. SHE IS FIVE MONTHS BEHIND ON HER RENT. IF IT WASN'T FOR THIS ADDICTION MORATORIUM HER FAMILY WOULD BE FORCED ONTO THE STREETS. WE SEE OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS EVERY DAY. ON THE STREETS THOSE STORIES AND THOSE SPACES ARE REAL. JUST LIKE MY SISTER JANE DOE. IT OTHERS WHO WERE ON THE STREET WHO ARE HOMELESS. BUT LUCKILY FOR HER CHILDREN SHE FOUND A NEW JOB THE NEW J. O. B. NOW UNDER THIS BILL SHE QUALIFIES FOR THE RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND HAS A CHANCE TO LAND ON HER FEET. SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT. NEXT MONTH WHAT HAPPENED AROUND NEXT MONTH. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE HURTING ACROSS THE STATE. ACROSS THIS COUNTRY TOO MANY STORIES TO BE TOLD. YOU IN YOUR OWN DISTRICT HAVE SIMILAR STORIES AS WELL. THIS BILL ISN'T THE PERFECT BILL BUT IT KEEPS FAMILIES SAFE. ANY GIVES FAMILIES A LIFELINE BUT MST OF ALL IT GIVES PEOPLE HOPE. AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO INSTILL IN TODAY THIS BILL GIVES CALIFORNIA'S HOME SO I STRONGLY ASK YOU FOR STRONG AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER GIBSON MISS DAVIES YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. ARE PREFERRED I OFFER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS TO BE CONSIDERED REGARDING THIS BILL AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THE DEADLINE FOR CITIES TO APPLY FOR THIS DISTANCE IS FEBRUARY TWENTY FIRST I CAN FIND ANY APPLICATION FORMS OR LANGUAGE DO YOU KNOW WHEN THIS IS AVAILABLE FOR ALMOST THREE WEEKS OUT. WHAT IS THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE RENTAL ASSISTANCE DOLLARS GOING TO BE. HAVE YOU WORKED WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS LIKE RENTAL HOUSING PROVIDERS IN THE PROCESS TO MAKE THE DISTRIBUTION OF RENTAL ASSISTANCE DOLLARS WORKABLE. IF NOT WOULD YOU COMMIT TO DOING SO AS WE MOVE FRWARD. I ASK THAT WE ALL KEEP IN MIND THAT MANY LANDLORDS ARE SMALL BUSINESSES MOM AND POPS THEY DEPEND ON THE RENT TO SUPPLEMENT THEIR INCOME. AND pTHAT THEY RECEIVE DOESN'T JUST GO TO PAY THE MORTGAGE. BUT IT ALSO COVERS INSURANCE PROPERTY TAXES AND MAINTENANCE. BY ONLY OFFERING THEM AN 80% RECOVERY MANY OF THEM WILL HAVE TO HOLD OFF AND MAINTAINING THE RENTAL PROPERTIES WHICH COULD EASILY BECOME A SAFETY ISSUE. TO THOSE WERE TRYING TO PROTECT. OR WORSE LOSE THEIR PROPERTY TO THE BANK WHICH COULD ULTIMATELY. DISPLACING TENANTS. THIS BILL HAS A LOT TO OFFER ANY OTHER THINGS THAT ARE NOT PLEASE WITH I THINK WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP IN MIND THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF BOTH THE SMALL MOM AND POP LANDLORDS IS WHAT THE TENANTS. AND LET'S REMEMBER TO THE REASON WHY WE'RE STANDING UP HERE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE GOT TO GET CALIFORNIA BACK UP AND OPEN. THE REASON WHY WE'RE DOING THIS IS BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE STILL UNEMPLOYED YOUR SERVICE IN THE FOR YOUR HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY IF WE CAN GET THAT UP AND MOVING HOPEFULLY JUNE TWENTIETH JUNE THIRTY FIRST WILL BE THE LAST STATE WILL HAVE TO ACTUALLY EXTEND THIS SO LET'S KEEP THAT THAT THE BIG PICTURE. THANK YOU. AMOS DAVIES. NEVER TO BE LIKE TO SPEAK PLEASE RAISE YOUR MICROPHONES NOW. MISS CLARK SILVA NUMBER THE CHAMBER. WE ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MEMBERS IN MISTER SPEAKERS. I RISE TODAY TO SUPPORT SB NINETY ONE. MEMBERS A YEAR AGO AS WE STOOD HERE ON THIS FLOOR AND LISTEN TO OUR GOVERNOR SPEAK ABOUT HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS AND RECOVERY WE HAD NO IDEA THAT JUST A FEW MONTHS LATER WE'D BE FACED WITH THE WORST PANDEMIC WITH JOB LOSS THAT WE'VE NEVER SEEN. AND DEATH THAT WE'VE NEVER IMAGINED. JUST A FEW NIGHTS AGO AS ALL OF US COME TO SACRAMENTO TO DO OUR WORK. WE HEARD THOSE WINDS BLOW. WE SAW THE TEMPERATURES DROP. AND WE SAW THAT PEOPLE DIED ON THE STREETS RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO. DIED OF HOMELESSNESS. BECAUSE THEY HAD NOWHERE TO GO. WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS BEING IN PERFECT AND WE KNOW THE GOVERNMENT IS IN PERFECT. WE'RE SADDENED AND HORRIFIED BY THE EDG CLAIMS AND FRAUD. WE'RE DEVASTATED BY THE DEATH. AND EVEN MORE SHOCKED BY THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE WORK AND CANNOT GO BACK TO WORK INTEL THE VIRUS AND THE NUMBERS DECLINE. BUT COULD NOT ACT BECAUSE OF AN IMPERFECT BILL WOULD MEAN. PUTTING MORE PEOPLE INTO HOMELESSNESS. WE ALREADY HAD AN ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND ADDING MORE. PEOPLE TO BECOME HOMELESS JUST ADDS AND STRETCHES OUR GOVERNMENT EVEN FURTHER. WE ALSO KNOW THAT WHEN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN EVICTED. IT TAKES MANY MANY YEARS FOR THEM TO RECOVER TO BE ABLE TO GET INTO HOUSING AGAIN AND IT ALSO TAKES THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. WHETHER IT'S STILL A SECRET ATTORNEY WHETHER IT'S A CLEAR IN A VACATION AND WE KNOW THAT KEEPING THEM IN THEIR HOME IS THE BEST WAY TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS. SO I DO SUPPORT THIS BILL I WILL BE PRAYING THAT THE SYSTEM FOR PEOPLE TO SEEK RELIEF FOR RENTERS AND LANDLORDS WERE WORK MUCH MORE EFFICIENTLY THAN WE'VE SEEN BEFORE BUT I SUPPORT SB. NINETY ONE AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TO. THANK YOU MS CLARK SILVA MISSED RIVAS YOUR RECORD. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION. ALSO WANT TO THANK LEADERSHIP OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO WHO IS INVESTED SO MUCH TIME ON ON THIS ISSUE IMPORTANT ISSUE. SB NINETY ONE IS A NECESSARY MEASURE. THAT'S NEEDED IN THIS TIME OF CRISIS. BEFORE COVER NINETEEN THREE POINT THREE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WERE LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. AND AS MANY OF US KNOW ALL IT TOOK WAS ONE. ONE EMERGENCY ROOM VISIT. ONE DAY OF LOST WAGES ONE UNEXPECTED COST TO JEOPARDIZE THEIR ABILITY TO PAY RENT. THE COUNTY MONTEREY THE LARGEST COUNTY THAT I REPRESENT 47% OF HOUSEHOLDS WERE RENTERS IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. OF THOSE 47% ABOUT HALF PAID 35% OR MORE OF THEIR INCOME ON RENT. NOW THIS PANDEMIC SHUT DOWNS THEY PUT MANY OF THESE PEOPLE AND UP. A PRECARIOUS SITUATION. MANY HAVE LOST JOBS FACED SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED INCOMES. THEY WORRY THAT THEY THEIR FAMILIES COULD END UP ON THE STREETS OR LIVING IN CROWDED HOUSING CONDITIONS WITH FRIENDS WITH FAMILIES LEAVING THEM EVEN MORE VULNERABLE THE CORONAVIRUS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT BLACK AND BROWN AREAS OF THE STATE OUR COMMUNITIES. ARE PARTICULARLY AT RISK. ACCORDING TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE LATINOS. WHO MAKE UP 38% OF OUR STATE WORKFORCE. ACCOUNT SINCE THIS PANDEMIC STARTED 50% IF WE DO NOT EXTEND THIS MORATORIUM. THEN WE ARE FAILING. WE ARE FAILING TO UNDERSTAND THE GRAVITY OF THIS SITUATION. THE UNPREDICTABLE IN THE VULNERABLE POSITION THAT MANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE FACING RIGHT NOW. AS WE'VE HEARD SB NINETY ONE IS NOT PERFECT. BUT IT IS GOING TO HELP PREVENT A WAVE OF EVICTIONS AND SUBSEQUENT HOMELESSNESS DURING THIS PANDEMIC. IT'LL PROVIDE FINANCIAL RELIEF TO BOTH RENTERS AND LANDLORDS AND WE ALL KNOW THAT WE GOT TO HELP WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO COME BACK WE HAVE TO REVISIT THIS ISSUE. I PROVIDE EVEN FURTHER PROTECTIONS. BUT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TO TAKE ACTION. AND AS MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE. WE HAVE THE HUMBLING RESPONSIBILITY OF GOVERNING THIS STATE INTHIS INCREDIBLY THIS IS INCREDIBLE MOMENT THIS UNPRECEDENTED MOMENT OF CRISIS. AND WE'VE GOT TO STAND UP WE GOT A VOTE LIKE IT IS. SO IT'S HELP OUR CONSTITUENTS TODAY WE'RE GOING TO HELP THEM STAY HOUSED. AND PREVENT THE FURTHER SPREAD OF THIS VIRUS THAT'S WHY I AM PROUD TO SUPPORT SB NINETY ONE TODAY THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. THANK YOU MYSTERY OF US MISTER BENNETT YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MEMBERS THANK YOU- MISTER MISTER CHAIRMAN. I RISE TODAY. IN SUPPORT OF SB NINETY ONE BECAUSE OUR LEADERSHIP HAS DONE A REMARKABLY GOOD JOB OF ADDRESSING THREE REAL CHALLENGES ONE WE HAD A FAST APPROACHING DEADLINE TO WE HAD SOME CHALLENGING FEDERAL RESTRICTIONS THREE WE HAD SOME SIGNIFICANT UNKNOWNS HOW MANY LANDLORDS WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS WHAT IS THE SIZE OF THE PROBLEM DO WE HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES HERE TO ADDRESS THIS. AND SO THIS IS A GOOD SOLUTION FOR THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA THIS IS A GOOD SOLUTION FOR THE LANDLORDS AND TENANTS IN MY DISTRICT. BUT THIS IS AN ESSENTIAL SOLUTION FOR THE FARM WORKERS IN MY DISTRICT. WHO ARE DOUBLED AND TRIPLED UP. AND DESPERATELY NEED TO TRY TO HAVE SOMETHING DONE TO ADDRESS THE DEBTS THAT THEY HAVE BUILT UP. THERE ARE ALSO CHALLENGED BY WORKING IN. ONE OF THE MOST HIGH RISK OCCUPATIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO RISE AND SPEAK IN FAVOR IN SUPPORT OF SB NINETY ONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER BENNETT. THANK YOU MEMBERS. MISTER SPEAKER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS MEMBERS I RISE TO ADD MY VOICE TO THOSE ASKING FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON S.B. NINETY ONE IT IS SIGNIFICANT THAT WE NEED TO APPROVE A BUDGET BILL IN JANUARY IT IS BECAUSE WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE TIME. WE NEED TO PROTECT PEOPLE RIGHT NOW. SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE EVEN MORE FAMILIES OUT ON THE STREET WITHOUT A HOME. THE FACT THAT THERE ARE MANY OUT THERE NOW IN THE RAIN AND THE WIND AND COLD WEATHER SUGGESTS THE SIZE OF THE PROBLEM THAT WE FACE. IN RECENT YEARS WE ARE FOCUSED ON ADDING TO CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING STOCK AND THAT'S GREAT. BUT IN THE PAST YEAR WE HAVE SEEN HOW QUICKLY SOMETHING LIKE OF IT. CAN PUT SOMEONE WHO ALREADY HAS A HOME. AT RISK OF LOSING IT. TODAY'S LEGISLATION IS INTENDED TO PROTECT PEOPLE WHO ARE AT IMMEDIATE RISK OF LOSING THEIR HOMES BECAUSE OF BECAUSE OF IT. THEY DO NOT DESERVE TO BE OUT ON THE STREETS. THIS WILL GIVE THEM A FEW MORE MONTHS OF SECURITY. WE NEED TO USE THAT TIME TO MAKE SURE WE CAN FIND A MORE LASTING SOLUTION. BECAUSE THEY WON'T DESERVE HOMELESSNESS DUE TO CODE. ANYMORE IN JULY THAN THEY DO TODAY. LET'S PASS THIS BILL TODAY. BUT LET US NOT THINK THAT OUR WORK IS DONE OUR WORK IS NOT DONE. I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB NINETY ONE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. MISTER CHANG FOR THE CLOSE.
