THE SET AND IT'S TO HAVE YOU ABOARD. AND TO THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR A LONG ME TO MAKE MY PRESENT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND OF COURSE THE MEMBER THANK ONCE AGAIN. I'M HERE TO REPRESENT SENATE BILL NINE OH SEVEN WHICH PERTAINS TO MILITARY CHILD ADVOCACY. AS CHAIR OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON VETERANS AFFAIRS I AM EXTREMELY CONCERNED FOR THE WELFARE OF ALL THE CHILDREN AT THIRTY THREE MILITARY BASES AND INSTALLATIONS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA HAS RESPONSIBILITY AND AUTHORITY TO ADDRESS CHILD WELFARE REGARDING ALL CHILDREN RESIDING IN THE STATE INCLUDING THE AUTHORITY TO REMOVE CHILDREN. FROM THEIR FAMILIES DUE TO MALTREATMENT. THE DEPARTMENT DEFENSE HAS THE STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS TO ADDRESS CHILD ABUSE AND MILITARY FAMILIES INCLUDING REPORTING ALL ALLEGATIONS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT TO LOCAL CHILD PROTECTIVE AUTHORITIES FOR INVESTIGATION. MOST OFTEN INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES CONDUCT THESE INVESTIGATIONS. HOWEVER THERE IS NO CORRESPONDING REQUIREMENT FOR THE COUNTY SHOULD NOTIFY THE LOCAL MILITARY INSTALLATIONS WHEN AN INVESTIGATION OF A MILITARY FAMILY IS BEING CONDUCTED. AS A RESULT COUNTY CHILD WELFARE SERVICE OFFICES MAY NOT CROSS FOR MILITARY FAMILIES INVOLVED IN CASES OF ALLEGED CHILD ABUSE TO SERVICE PROVIDERS ON THE BASE ITSELF SUCH AS THE FAMILY ADVOCACY PROGRAM. IN THE WORSTCASE SCENARIO A MILITARY FAMILY INVOLVED IN AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION OF AN ALLEGED CHILD ABUSE OR NEGLECT COULD BE REASSIGNED TO ANOTHER STATE WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE MILITARY PUTTING MILITARY CHILDREN IN DANGER OF CONTINUED ABUSE WITHOUT NEEDED INTERVENTION. AS FAMILIES CONTINUE TO SHELTER AT HOME THE NUMBER OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES HAVE BEEN INCREASED HOWEVER THE NUMBER OF CHILD ABUSE CASES REPORTED HAVE DECREASED. WELL SCHOOL IS NOT IN SESSION AND CHILDREN ARE NOT ATTENDING DAYCARE OR CAMPS OR OTHER FACILITIES OUTSIDE THE HOUSEHOLD IT IS LIKELY THAT CASES OF CHILD ABUSE ARE GOING TO BE UNNOTICED OR NOT EVEN REPORTED. WITHOUT ANOTHER PARTY INTERACTING AND MINORING KIDS ON A REGULAR BASIS CHILDREN AND ABUSIVE OR NEGLECTED HOMES ARE AT HIGHER RISK. SB NINE OH SEVEN WOULD REQUIRE LOCAL CHILD WELFARE SERVICE OFFICES IN CASES OF ALLEGED CHILD ABUSE OR NEGLECT TO DETERMINE IF THE PARENT OR GUARDIAN. THE MILITARY MEMBER. SB NINE OH SEVEN WOULD HAVE HE CHILDREN OF MEN FAMILIES BY COORDINATION BETWEEN ON BASE FAMILY ADVOCACY PROGRAMS AND THE COUNTY CHILD WELFARE SERVICE OFFICES. THE BILL WOULD ALSO CLARIFY THAT CHILD WELFARE SERVICE OFFICES HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DEVELOP MEMORANDUMS OF UNDERSTANDING WITH MILITARY INSTALLATIONS WITH THEIR JURISDICTIONS. THESE MO USE FACILITATE BETTER COMMUNICATION AND COOPERATION BETWEEN BASES AND A COUNTIES DURING THE INVESTIGATION OF CHILD ABUSE. TWENTY FOUR STATES HAVE ALREADY PASSED SIMILAR LEGISLATION. SB NINE OH SEVEN IS A WIN WIN FOR THE STATE MILITARY SUPPORT PROGRAMS AND MILITARY FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE CAN INCREASE ACCESS TO PREVENTION SERVICES FOR MILITARY FAMILIES AND FOSTER BETTER COORDINATION OF SERVICES BETWEEN MILITARY BASES AND COUNTY SUPPORT SERVICES ALL TO THE BENEFIT OF MILITARY CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES. TODAY I HAVE KATHY CENTER LANE MCDONALD DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AND IT KELLY MAY DOUGLAS SOUTHWEST REGIONAL LAYS ON FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE STATE LIAISON OFFICE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT SB THIRTEEN FORTY ONE WHICH WILL ALLOW CAL WORKS FAMILIES WHOSE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN PLACED IN FOSTER CARE CONTINUE RECEIVING MONTHLY CASH ASSISTANCE WELL THE REUNIFICATION EFFORTS ONGOING WITHIN THE TILED WELFARE SYSTEM. THE CURRENT PRACTICE REMOVING CASH ASSISTANCE FROM A FAMILY THAT IS ALREADY BELOW THE POVERTY LINE MAKES IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT. YOU KNOW I WITH THEIR CHILDREN. ADDITIONALLY A COULD DESTABILIZE THE FAMILY AND ULTIMATELY RESOLVED THE FAMILY BECOMING HOMELESS. GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT HOUSING CRISIS FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE ARE FREE SEEN IT IS TIME TO READ. TO RE VISIT THE POLICY DECISION THAT ALLOW SERVICES BUT NOT CASH ASSISTANCE TO CONTINUE DURING REUNIFICATION EFFORTS. DESTABILIZING FAMILY TO THE POINT OF FOOLISHNESS IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO OTHER EFFORTS TO SUPPORT FAMILIES WELL THE SEEK TO REUNIFY WITH THE CHILDREN. IMPORTANTLY THIS BILL ALL PLACE TO FAMILIES THAT ARE ACTIVELY WORKING ON REUNIFICATION WITH CHILD WELFARE WORKERS MEANING THAT THE CHILD HAS BEEN REMOVED. FROM THE PARENT AND PLACED IN OUT OF HOME CARE WHICH IS DEFINED AS TEMPORARY CARE SITUATION AND ONE THE RECORDS THE REUNIFICATION CLASS. THIS DOES NOT BODE CASES WHERE THE CHILD WAS REMOVED BUT THE COUNTY DOES. NOT RECOMMEND FAMILY REUNIFICATION SERVICES. SB THIRTEEN FORTY ONE WILL ENHANCE THE ABILITY OF CHILD WELFARE PROGRAMS TO REUNIFY FOSTER CHILDREN WITH THEIR PARENTS BY ALLOWING CAL WORKS FAMILIES WHOSE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN PLACED IN FOSTER CARE. TO CONTINUE RECEIVING MONTHLY CASH ASSISTANCE. ALL ACTIVE REUNIFICATION EFFORTS ARE OP WHEN IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM.

WELL NAT WHAT IS THAT OR AN IN WITH THE SIGNET HOUSES. THE VERY HIGH COST OF LIVING AND- EVEN MORE RECENTLY OBVIOUSLY THE ECONOMIC SITUATION THAT WE'RE IN DUE TO THE PANDEMIC IT MAKES EVEN MORE SENSE TO REVISIT THE QUESTION OF CONTINUING THE GRANT FOR THE FAMILY. WE'VE MADE SOME EFFORT TO HELP STABILIZE FAMILIES WHEN THEIR CHILDREN ARE REMOVED FROM THEIR- SUCH AS THE BREACH. HOME PRO. WILL PROVIDE HOUSING SUPPORT FOR FAMILIES WHO ARE% HOMELESS ARE ON THE VERGE OF BECOMING HOMELESS. THEY CAN GET THEIR KIDS BACK IF THEY'RE HOMELESS WE DON'T TAKE A CHILD OUT OF THE HOME JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE HOW MUCH. A JUDGE WILL NOT RETURN TO TALK TO A CAR OR ANOTHER COMPLETELY AND HOUSING SITUATION AT THE WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF WORK TO TRY TO HELP STABILIZE THE FAMILY. AND TO OUR MEMBERS. WATER RIVAS QUESTION. WE HOPE TO HELP THAT AVOID GETTING STABLE IN THE FIRST PLACE BY GOING AHEAD A CONTINUING THE MODEST GRANT TO THAT FAMILY WHILE THEY ACTIVELY WORK WITH OUR CHILD WELFARE STAFF TO REUNIFY WITH THEIR CHILD WE COULD GO GIVE MORE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES A BETTER SHOT AT GETTING UNIFIED AND ALSO HELP TO KEEP FAMILY STABLE ESPECIALLY AT THIS TIME PARTICULARLY.
